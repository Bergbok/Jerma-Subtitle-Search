[00:08.60]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.34]Jerma here with some more chivalry.
[00:12.78]Medieval combat.
[00:13.98]Oh, medieval warfare.
[00:14.96]What did I say?
[00:15.40]Combat?
[00:16.14]That's not correct.
[00:17.74]Playing as the knight right now with a big, giant, clunky two-hander.
[00:21.47]This is elimination right now, so if you die, you are permanently dead.
[00:26.17]So you gotta be more careful than usual, and there's a lot of guys coming up here right now!
[00:32.26]Oh, my head smashed!
[00:33.68]Did I get the hit?
[00:35.04]At least I got the hit on him.
[00:36.04]That's all I care about.
[00:37.87]Don't have a shield, so I'm really vulnerable.
[00:40.79]Don't kill each other!
[00:42.61]Wow, wow, I'm getting hit by my own teammates.
[00:46.70]Oh, get out of here, man.
[00:49.08]Whoa, dude, you're hitting me.
[00:50.98]What are you doing?
[00:52.00]What is this guy doing?
[00:52.96]Dude, bro, you are swinging at the wrong person.
[00:56.70]That guy just did at least like... All right, you know what?
[00:58.90]You're getting killed.
[01:00.15]Get the hell out of here.
[01:02.05]You're getting destroyed, bro.
[01:04.25]What on earth are you doing?
[01:05.47]That guy was an imbecile.
[01:08.47]Get around the corner here.
[01:09.33]A lot of blue guys.
[01:12.11]Lot of blue guys.
[01:18.27]Anybody come from behind?
[01:19.01]No, we're good.
[01:19.35]We're good.
[01:20.35]Hold your ground, man.
[01:21.37]Stand your ground.
[01:22.34]Alright, get the guy that's running.
[01:25.74]Get the guy that's running.
[01:26.40]He's vulnerable.
[01:26.96]He's vulnerable.
[01:27.32]Look at him.
[01:27.58]He's like... Oh, that guy.
[01:33.48]That eye-opener.
[01:35.58]Oh, wow.
[01:36.50]Archer.
[01:39.57]Oh, this is scary.
[01:40.67]I don't have very much health.
[01:41.39]I'm regenerating it, though.
[01:43.92]That was not a good idea.
[01:46.12]That guy is in trouble down here.
[01:47.54]Two on one!
[01:48.36]Oh, come on!
[01:52.34]Geez!
[01:54.76]Oh, fake him out.
[01:55.48]Fake him out.
[01:57.06]Going for the run.
[01:58.50]Oh, just missed.
[02:01.64]How did I miss that?
[02:03.18]How on earth did I miss that?
[02:06.06]Too many things going on.
[02:07.08]Is there just one guy behind me?
[02:09.49]What?
[02:09.87]What?
[02:10.45]What?
[02:12.01]I'm gonna hop down and Wolverine-style hit this guy in his head.
[02:15.51]Ah, two on one.
[02:18.27]Ah, two on two.
[02:18.85]We can do this, man.
[02:19.89]Just be smart.
[02:20.55]Be smart.
[02:22.65]Be smart.
[02:23.13]Be smart.
[02:23.43]Oh, they got a third coming.
[02:24.13]They got a third coming.
[02:26.48]Oh!
[02:27.04]Is anyone behind us?
[02:27.70]Nope.
[02:28.80]This is a 4v2 situation here, man.
[02:30.96]We're in some trouble.
[02:35.94]They're, like, hitting each other.
[02:39.61]Nice, nice.
[02:44.16]Oh.
[02:47.14]Nice.
[02:47.76]Good job.
[02:48.52]Good job.
[02:49.20]Wow, we took on like four guys.
[02:50.56]Oh, you took on like four guys.
[02:52.58]Good job, dude.
[02:55.96]Anybody left?
[02:57.32]Oh, they're storming him.
[03:00.38]Yeah, that's it.
[03:01.98]Nice job.
[03:03.38]We did it.
[03:04.23]We won that round.
[03:06.33]I love you.
[03:12.55]I'm going in this time.
[03:13.45]I'm going straight in.
[03:14.43]I'm going for the archers.
[03:16.31]Wow.
[03:19.21]Oh, maybe not.
[03:19.91]Probably not.
[03:21.81]Ah, I missed.
[03:23.99]Go for the jab.
[03:24.81]Nice.
[03:26.99]Go for another jab.
[03:27.83]Go for an overhead.
[03:29.03]Go for an overhead.
[03:29.59]Go for a side swing on this bastard.
[03:32.05]Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:32.81]I'm sorry.
[03:33.25]I'm sorry.
[03:33.59]I didn't mean to.
[03:39.12]Wait, how did I not kill him?
[03:43.57]I'm hitting the tree!
[03:44.47]I'm, like, chopping down a tree for firewood.
[03:52.09]Oh, coming from behind!
[03:53.84]Crush!
[03:56.88]Oh, you're gonna see better days!
[04:10.77]How do you scream?
[04:11.71]Because that's hilarious.
[04:16.89]That is a long scream, man.
[04:18.45]That guy had some practice.
[04:20.91]He must be like a singer.
[04:22.91]Can I get up there?
[04:23.65]No.
[04:24.83]Waiting on this guy to jump down.
[04:26.23]Me and my boy over here.
[04:30.70]Both got long swords.
[04:31.90]We both know what's going on.
[04:33.12]I don't see anybody.
[04:36.48]Oh, they're all back here.
[04:37.14]They're all getting crushed.
[04:39.62]Alright, yeah.
[04:40.22]You are gonna get smashed.
[04:43.31]Maybe not.
[04:45.99]I love how it's just like, yeet!
[04:47.37]I feel like a Rockette.
[04:52.59]I can't even spam it.
[04:53.55]Oh, that's stupid.
[04:55.29]My long blade has been in the generational families since the day my grandfather took the field of battle and missed his first overhead swing, but then my grandfather took a swing from behind, blocked the incoming attack, and swung and crushed it and then died.
[05:13.08]Alright, so I'm gonna shellcast this as if I were, like, in the medieval times.
[05:16.46]So here we go.
[05:17.98]And we have Brother Matthew attacking the swordsmith of the right side there.
[05:22.62]We've got a couple at the side there.
[05:24.10]We've got lots of people fighting.
[05:25.99]Oh, what an absolutely brilliant blow on his chest.
[05:29.69]We have Governor Stevenson, even though Stevenson isn't even a medieval name, but it's okay.
[05:34.81]So Governor Stevenson is attacking Walter Malfiao, which is the strongest knight they have.
[05:40.54]Stronger than any blue moon or green moon.
[05:43.86]And he gets the kill on him.
[05:45.62]Absolutely fantastic with that blow.
[05:47.62]I sound like a golf guy.
[05:49.52]Like the guys that do the... No, they're killing each other.
[05:52.66]Oh.
[05:52.80]Don't you throw things at me.
[05:53.64]I don't approve of that.
[05:54.26]Why don't you come down?
[05:54.94]Why don't you jump down?
[05:55.96]I will club you.
[05:57.30]Come on.
[06:08.86]Hey, you sure got that nice pretty shield.
[06:11.12]Is your guy running by?
[06:16.26]Hurt the tree.
[06:17.28]Oh, you want to go?
[06:20.98]You want to go?
[06:21.38]Oh, you want to go with me?
[06:23.28]Is that what you said?
[06:23.82]You want to get stabbed?
[06:24.94]You want to get stabbed and you want to get swung at?
[06:28.32]Oh.
[06:29.40]Okay.
[06:32.03]Watch the right side.
[06:34.97]Come in with the blow.
[06:36.53]I didn't accidentally...
[06:38.89]Where is he?
[06:40.23]Was it an archer?
[06:41.81]I think it... Oh, wow!
[06:42.98]It was an archer!
[06:48.26]Anybody left?
[06:48.80]Who's left?
[06:49.18]What have we got here?
[06:51.25]Well, that's it.
[06:52.95]The Mason Order is victorious again!
