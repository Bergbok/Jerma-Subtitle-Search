[00:08.46]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.00]Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[00:13.02]This Scare Saturday is going to be a little different than you're used to.
[00:16.64]I'm actually going to be doing two games tonight.
[00:19.47]And the reason for this is the first one that I do starts off really creepy and kind of scary, and then...
[00:26.13]It just gets comical, it gets funny.
[00:29.09]So instead of having just one short video where it's like four or five minutes long, I do a second video as well.
[00:35.05]So this is like a double video.
[00:36.41]It's two games in one.
[00:38.03]The first one is Lumber Island, and the second one is The Room.
[00:42.48]Respective links will be in the description.
[00:44.34]Let me know what you think about these two games.
[00:46.92]The second one is pretty scary.
[00:49.26]It's a very, very, very, very bare-bones independent project.
[00:52.90]But we'll see how you guys enjoy them.
[00:54.74]I'll see you guys all next time.
[00:55.76]And of course, take care, everybody.
[00:58.32]See you there.
[01:01.89]Apparently, I'm looking at a rock.
[01:05.85]Oh, well, whatever.
[01:06.91]That was weird.
[01:08.41]Created by Dean Forge.
[01:13.91]I don't like how I can't see anything.
[01:17.12]Can I sprint?
[01:18.74]Not really.
[01:20.86]Chapter 1, The Letter.
[01:24.52]I feel like I'm playing Slender right now.
[01:29.12]What's up, bird?
[01:29.82]Ooh, a campfire.
[01:39.32]I'm gonna go toast some marshmallows.
[01:44.97]A little teddy.
[01:45.71]Okay.
[01:48.85]Should I pick it up?
[01:50.45]What can I do here?
[01:56.59]Oh, I got it.
[01:57.11]Okay.
[01:58.69]What the hell?
[01:59.19]That's pretty eerie.
[02:00.93]It's just like a teddy ruxpin.
[02:02.73]Can I do anything else?
[02:06.13]I don't think I can even do anything else.
[02:08.54]Alright, well I got my teddy bear.
[02:13.06]What do I do now?
[02:19.67]What's that say?
[02:21.11]Welcome to the Lumber Island, a place you will never forget.
[02:25.91]And the brawny paper towel man is like here to welcome you.
[02:31.02]Remember, use brawny when you got those big messes to clean up.
[02:35.50]They came again, now with the threats.
[02:38.44]I don't know how much longer I hold up, but I'll never sell my land.
[02:43.38]Okay.
[02:45.44]Go back to clothes.
[02:46.75]Oh, right.
[02:51.27]Okay, that's the camera.
[02:52.66]What, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[02:55.86]Yeah?
[02:56.34]Yes?
[02:59.02]What's with the music?
[03:06.03]What is with this music?
[03:10.09]Oh my god.
[03:11.79]I don't think he has a head.
[03:15.19]Oh my god, he doesn't have a head.
[03:23.68]What do I do?
[03:24.18]What do I do?
[03:25.04]Just run away from this dude?
[03:32.59]The headless brawny paper towel man.
[03:37.96]Don't get stuck on a rock, go!
[03:44.16]What do I do?
[03:49.91]Is this gotta be some like, can I get like a gun?
[03:51.61]Can I shoot this guy?
[04:03.10]It's like Michael Myers.
[04:07.11]Oh, I put the teddy bear down.
[04:09.31]What's with the mist?
[04:12.15]Get away from me, bro.
[04:12.87]Alright, I'm going to try and find his boots.
[04:23.56]Because he's pissed off.
[04:24.60]That's why he's going...
[04:31.62]He's kinda slow.
[04:35.56]He's not the fastest.
[04:40.20]He's not the fastest man.
[04:42.83]But he is big and he's got an axe.
[04:47.11]Let's get a good look at this guy.
[04:59.10]He's really slow.
[05:02.17]I kind of feel bad for this guy right now.
[05:04.99]Like, he wants to catch me, but he just ain't gonna catch me.
[05:09.29]He's just not gonna catch me.
[05:11.95]What if I... Can I get back in the boat?
[05:14.90]Will he come, like, into the boat?
[05:21.40]I don't think he realizes he can, like, come over here.
[05:23.24]Let's see.
[05:23.60]Let's see what happens.
[05:24.26]Does he come in the boat?
[05:33.60]Ladies and gentlemen, the slug monster.
[05:40.84]Don't kill me!
[05:52.51]Sir, excuse me.
[06:00.48]So, new game.
[06:01.10]Let's go.
[06:04.16]I like the rain.
[06:05.70]The rain can clear everything.
[06:08.34]Wash the dirty things from me.
[06:10.32]Dirty things like sand, mud, blood, or sin.
[06:14.78]This is like a bad teleprompter.
[06:16.16]Can I make this, like, go faster?
[06:19.34]What'd I do?
[06:20.98]What can you see in this picture?
[06:23.65]A sad face, praying, or a rose?
[06:30.08]I think I see if I'm not gonna lie.
[06:31.40]I see a face.
[06:32.06]That's a sad face I see and what what do you think about this one?
[06:37.72]What is this like a psychology test a crown castle or horns I?
[06:44.72]Kind of looks like I'm gonna say castle.
[06:46.83]I would say castle Great stronghold that's surprising once again.
[06:51.31]It's a fairies screaming or a puppy I See a puppy
[06:58.05]That looks like a cute little node there.
[06:59.45]You can... Okay.
[07:05.70]So what the hell... What was that all about?
[07:08.84]Simple metal table with some stuff on it.
[07:14.10]My bed.
[07:14.66]I'm not tired yet.
[07:15.56]This is the guy's house?
[07:17.50]This is like a wicked screwed up house if you ask me.
[07:21.05]Get out of the way.
[07:24.22]I have a giant poster of... internal organs.
[07:30.10]What's that?
[07:31.06]Oh, it's my daughter.
[07:31.94]Hello, daughter.
[07:35.77]What the hell do I do?
[07:38.31]Can I, like, leave this room?
[07:40.19]It is called the room probably for a reason.
[07:43.45]I don't like the FOV, man.
[07:48.01]Closed.
[07:48.43]Alright, I get it.
[07:52.23]It's closed.
[07:54.36]Really?
[07:54.76]What?
[07:56.14]I really like the rain.
[07:57.06]Please, someone can hear me.
[07:59.70]It was just using... You know that sound?
[08:01.08]That was like the AOL instant messenger.
[08:03.30]Somebody just signed off noise.
[08:11.12]Can I move these boxes?
[08:12.12]Simple wooden crates.
[08:12.84]I don't know why... What did that say?
[08:14.52]Why they're here.
[08:15.10]A vent.
[08:17.72]You can always go in the vent.
[08:19.76]I know this from experience.
[08:22.64]Move out of the way.
[08:24.97]I feel like I'm looking through a... Yeah, the rain did stop.
[08:32.60]Why?
[08:33.12]Did the rain stop?
[08:35.48]I don't like this!
[08:39.24]Hehehehehe!
[08:55.78]I don't know what to do.
[08:57.84]This is not cool.
[08:59.68]Picture of a little girl.
[09:00.52]I don't remember who it is.
[09:02.52]Who is she?
[09:03.04]I don't know.
[09:03.50]Is this your house?
[09:05.96]I can't move.
[09:10.01]Wait, one of the pictures looks different.
[09:12.53]My memory isn't good.
[09:17.85]What?
[09:18.31]Hi.
[09:21.55]Over the window?
[09:22.39]What?
[09:22.69]What do you mean over the window?
[09:23.55]Over the window?
[09:23.87]What does that mean?
[09:24.27]What's that mean?
[09:24.63]What's that mean?
[09:25.00]What's that mean?
[09:30.55]I feel like the whole world's closing in.
[09:36.21]Can I jump?
[09:41.86]Shut up!
[09:44.78]Can I go in the vent?
[09:48.06]Wind coming from here.
[09:49.10]If I can open it, maybe I can escape.
[09:50.82]I can't even tell what's happening, let alone, like... Is this like a crowbar I can grab?
[10:01.00]Anyone's out there, please.
[10:04.07]No answer.
[10:05.03]Fucking bulletproof glass.
[10:06.37]No one can hear me.
[10:08.61]So am I going like crazy inside my own head or something?
[10:20.71]Just a crow.
[10:22.40]I'll go to sleep.
[10:23.32]I'm supposed to go to sleep.

[11:34.11]I must escape.
