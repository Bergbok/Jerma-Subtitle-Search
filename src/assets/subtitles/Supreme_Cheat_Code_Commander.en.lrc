[00:05.03]The question will be answered tonight.
[00:08.47]Who in fact is the supreme commander of the armies at hand?
[00:13.53]What the hell?
[00:15.31]What the fuck was that?
[00:16.05]I said I'm not ready.
[00:17.83]Why are you not ready?
[00:18.82]I got a cat.
[00:21.10]You don't have a cat.
[00:22.30]It's getting everywhere.
[00:23.20]There's hair in my mic.
[00:24.20]You don't have a cat.
[00:29.28]You take your little guy, and you generate the power by putting the nodes on the things, and you build buildings to build units, and then I just fucking stomp you.
[00:37.79]I don't- I think this is gonna take too long.
[00:39.89]What do you mean it's gonna take too long?
[00:41.65]I'm just gonna kill you right now.
[00:44.05]What did you just do?
[00:45.43]What the fuck is this?
[00:49.13]Gig!
[00:51.34]Oh!
[00:51.76]Oh, look at- look at what's going on in the bottom there!
[00:54.02]Oh, Stur is cheating, and fucking like- I left you alone!
[01:00.45]It's just blinking on the bottom of my screen.
[01:01.95]You could blink in StarCraft.
[01:03.29]That wasn't considered cheating.
[01:04.57]It was an ability.
[01:05.59]I'm playing Protoss.
[01:08.69]How do you cheat?
[01:10.03]Cheat activate.
[01:14.19]How do you do that?
[01:16.17]You open up the console and you type the cheats.
[01:18.17]I don't know what that is.
[01:19.03]I'm trying to make my units.
[01:20.36]I'm trying to feed my soldiers and shit, and you're over here cheating.
[01:28.70]You teleported in here.
[01:33.30]What is happening?
[01:45.54]This is going to break the game.
[01:48.32]I thought my game just broke, but I accidentally clicked out of it.
[01:51.47]All right, so gentlemen's rules.
[01:53.39]No attacking.
[01:54.59]Do not attack me.
[01:55.55]I'm not going to attack you until we both have a thousand units.
[01:59.49]Okay?
[02:00.21]Yeah, okay.
[02:03.95]Are those all air guys?
[02:05.07]What the heck are those?
[02:05.67]Yeah, these are all planes.
[02:07.63]And there's so many units, dude, they have no way to go.
[02:09.39]They're all turning into this one, like, blob in the middle.
[02:14.44]It's like sucking up the planes into, like, one giant plane.
[02:19.14]Do you see this?
[02:20.34]No, I'm busy making my own suck-up planes.
[02:22.94]It's like... This is turning into, like, just a... Oh, dear God.
[02:28.48]I don't even want to know what's going to happen with this.
[02:32.59]The game's gonna start to freak out and not know what the hell's going on.
[02:35.19]I almost have a thousand units.
[02:37.90]Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are they going?
[02:38.88]Where are you guys going?
[02:39.78]I don't know.
[02:40.30]They're coming to attack me.
[02:41.72]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[02:42.40]No, no, no, no!
[02:43.00]Pull back!
[02:43.28]What are they doing?
[02:44.06]I'm trying!
[02:44.78]I'm trying to pull back!
[02:46.08]I'm trying!
[02:47.78]They won't listen!
[02:49.29]They have a mind of their own!
[02:50.55]I can't!
[02:51.25]They won't listen to me!
[02:53.67]I guess that's just what happens when you have a thousand units.
[02:56.05]Get out of here!
[02:57.39]I'm trying to pull it back!
[03:00.24]Holy shit.
[03:02.40]No, you fucking idiots.
[03:03.78]I'm trying.
[03:05.32]Don't engage.
[03:07.03]What are you doing?
[03:08.81]You're not supposed to engage.
[03:10.07]Now it's just a mess.
[03:11.35]Just pull back.
[03:12.77]Look what you've done.
[03:13.61]You've brought everybody.
[03:14.49]You've brought everybody.
[03:15.75]No.
[03:16.40]You attacked one person and all of this.
[03:18.54]It just looks like a firework exploded.
[03:21.56]My game's running very slowly, by the way.
[03:24.37]Can't even you did this you should have attacked.
[03:27.23]Oh you you attack you all your guys are coming at me Why did you pull any of them back you select and you right click select and then right?
[03:35.71]Look at the gravity I don't know if those guys come But they still shooting at
[03:55.57]I hope you're happy.
[04:00.97]You're gonna build a bunch of turrets, and I'm coming after you with just rats, okay?
[04:06.16]So you build as many turrets as you possibly can.
[04:08.86]If you change your mind later, there's air turrets and there's ground turrets.
[04:12.84]Don't be like, okay, now it's the air units.
[04:15.08]Let's see how this goes.
[04:16.10]It's not gonna happen.
[04:17.18]No, I'm coming after you with just rats.
[04:18.67]I'm gonna build a thousand rats, and you're gonna build towers.
[04:21.03]Are you ready?
[04:21.55]We'll start typing bling bling.
[04:24.34]If you select them all, too, and do the Alt-T, you can, like, keep them in a tiny, a small area.
[04:29.70]Wait, wait, wait.
[04:30.26]If I select everybody... Select them all and do Alt-T where your cursor is pointing.
[04:34.88]Alt-T.
[04:35.50]Didn't do anything.
[04:40.48]Oh, dear, dude.
[04:42.93]No!
[04:44.59]Oh, man.
[04:46.25]Why did you tell me to do that?
[04:48.37]I don't know.
[04:48.85]It looks like you got a little planet there.
[04:52.22]Oh, don't zoom in.
[04:53.24]I cannot zoom in.
[04:54.08]No.
[04:54.58]Yeah, zoom out and just... I... Oh, dear.
[04:57.48]Why did you have me do that?
[05:00.40]Why did you make me do that?
[05:02.93]I can't even look over there.
[05:04.45]No, I need to spread them out.
[05:06.19]I need to, like, pull them out.
[05:07.57]Because I can't even go over there.
[05:10.99]I heard a launch.
[05:11.51]What do you mean?
[05:12.17]No, no, no.
[05:13.33]We spent so much time.
[05:14.27]We spent so much time doing this.
[05:16.01]We spent that much time.
[05:17.61]No, please don't tell me you just dropped a fucking bomb.
[05:19.95]I mean, you teleported them all there.
[05:22.95]What a waste of fucking time!
[05:25.78]Oh god, you broke the whole rat colony!
[05:28.32]Uh, here they come.
[05:32.30]Okay, well... Come on, rats!
[05:35.56]I've got a good view angle of this.
[05:37.00]Break through the defenses!
[05:38.30]Let's see if they get even close to it.
[05:42.85]Where are they going?
[05:43.67]Some of them are like, wrapping around here!
[05:46.97]Oh my god, I have so many like, pop-ups that's telling me like, your game's broken.
[05:53.14]No, they're not getting anywhere near it.
[05:54.98]Come on, stop like bunching up like traffic and push in!
[05:59.58]They haven't even breached the wall yet.
[06:01.64]Like half of them aren't moving.
[06:03.46]Yeah, what are they doing?
[06:05.57]You idiots!
[06:07.29]Some of them are just standing completely still.
[06:11.05]Oh wow, this is fucking awful.
[06:14.58]They're all going up the mountain and instantly die.
[06:16.70]It's because of the wall, I think.
[06:18.41]That there's... Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:20.95]Dude, they're just walking into the wall.
[06:23.91]They're making themselves a choke point and just getting shot to death when they walk through it.
[06:28.44]Like, over here by this stupid, like, fucking underpass.
[06:31.94]They really are like ants.
