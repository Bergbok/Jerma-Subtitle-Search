[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.61]early, yeah?
[00:04.44]Do you guys think it's funny that the last probably two or three streams I've said, yeah, it's going to be starting around noon.
[00:12.74]Oh, just kidding.
[00:13.36]It's starting at 9.30 a.m.
[00:15.04]Pacific time.
[00:16.38]Don't you think that's funny?
[00:17.14]You know what I mean?
[00:19.28]It's clickbaiting.
[00:21.28]Am I?
[00:23.73]What did I do?
[00:27.13]The title is Finishing in the Top 10 is a win for me.
[00:31.80]That's just a fact.
[00:36.42]That's just me telling you what's going to happen.
[00:43.27]Finishing in 11th place is 2nd place.
[00:46.91]Finishing in 12th place is 3rd place.
[00:50.45]Make sure you remember that for this stream because that's going to happen quite a few times.
[00:54.43]You're a loser.
[00:56.33]That's not a loser.
[00:57.15]That's winning in your own world.
[01:01.14]That's called winning in your own world.
[01:08.02]He's settling.
[01:10.89]Alright, whatever you want to call it.
[01:13.89]I'm winning in my own world.
[01:14.97]That's a loser talk.
[01:23.54]No.
[01:24.62]It's not.
[01:26.78]As long as I make my rules...
[01:29.69]Look, if I come in 13th or 14th place, sure, I lost.
[01:34.51]I didn't win.
[01:35.73]I come in 12th place, that's 3rd place.
[01:37.33]Alright, are you ready?
[01:49.58]What about 40th?
[01:51.12]How many people are in this game?
[01:57.02]How many players are there? 60?
[02:01.09]Alright, is this game any good?
[02:03.89]Be real with me.
[02:04.67]I've seen a lot of people playing it.
[02:06.07]I've seen a ton of people playing it.
[02:07.49]I feel like people like it.
[02:14.86]It's pretty average.
[02:15.92]Well, here.
[02:16.52]Let's go ahead and take a look.
[02:17.44]Does this mean that I'm the 8,302nd fall guy?
[02:23.51]Does that mean that I'm the 8,300 person to install the game?
[02:32.68]How does that work?
[02:35.38]Or do I have to get that higher and be... That's my ranking.
[02:41.50]This is a tuber game?
[02:42.86]Well, whatever.
[02:44.04]I'm an X tuber.
[02:45.04]I think I'm allowed to be a tuber sometimes.
[02:58.01]I thought you were gonna play this with Ster.
[03:00.27]It's a little early for Ster though.
[03:01.65]I think he had something to do today.
[03:03.28]But I wanted to play it.
[03:05.30]Look, don't you guys know with all Tuber games, you've gotta strike while the iron's hot?
[03:09.36]Otherwise, don't do it!
[03:10.68]If I don't play this game now, you think I'm gonna play it in like six months?
[03:16.16]No, I've gotta jump on!
[03:18.88]I've gotta get on the ride!
[03:20.39]Let me get on the ride!
[03:22.97]I don't care that I'm sitting all the way in the back of the roller coaster.
[03:25.33]I mean, that sucks.
[03:27.84]I want to be up in the front, but I wasn't there.
[03:29.83]So I have to take my seat at the last spot of the roller coaster, but I'm not going to be able to see the big drop.
[03:34.49]Whatever.
[03:34.83]Okay, so if I press A right now, you guys are all going to press A at the same time, right?
[03:44.06]That's how this works, right?
[03:49.54]You wait for me to press A, and then everybody presses A?
[03:56.77]Here we go.
[03:57.97]I'm gonna press A now.
[04:00.43]Oh, some of you got fucked up there.
[04:02.90]I'm gonna press A right now.
[04:04.50]Oop.
[04:05.34]Sorry, some of you got messed up.
[04:06.66]Do a countdown.
[04:07.58]Sure.
[04:09.34]Wait, hold on.
[04:09.74]There's outfits.
[04:12.50]I like the blue.
[04:15.14]Uh, common?
[04:15.86]I kinda like the sprinkles.
[04:20.57]Oh, I like- I know, lightning bolt face.
[04:24.30]I'm not putting that on.
[04:25.48]This is the gibbous of this game.
[04:26.88]I'm not gonna wear it.
[04:27.66]People will know I'm new.
[04:34.31]I'm putting on the bird feet, though.
[04:35.59]That's important.
[04:40.11]Okay, cool.
[04:41.87]Yeah, let's go.
[04:46.33]Theatrics?
[04:48.15]Oh, this is on the D-pad.
[04:50.82]Oh, I don't have anything.
[04:52.40]Celebrations.
[04:56.26]Alright, what does this mean?
[04:58.34]Season 1.
[04:58.90]Wait, is it buy stuff?
[04:59.94]Oh, is it a buy things game?
[05:02.38]Oh, it's a buy things game.
[05:04.82]Is it?
[05:07.90]No, it's not, right?
[05:09.36]Yeah?
[05:10.52]It's pretty generous?
[05:11.32]Alright, cool.
[05:13.72]Alright, I'm just gonna- I have no idea what the fuck's going on.
[05:15.98]I only know there's like a hundred people don't lose, I guess.
[05:19.28]I don't know anything about this game.
[05:20.18]You ready?
[05:20.40]3, 2, 1, better press it!
[05:27.12]Ah, that's too bad.
[05:27.78]You were coming for me.
[05:29.80]How about now?
[05:34.68]Oh, wait.
[05:35.10]It just does this anyways.
[05:36.10]It's not like Hearthstone where you press the button and it locks you into somebody.
[05:41.97]Am I going to get stream sniped?
[05:43.47]This is what this game is, right?
[05:44.69]It's just stream sniper the game.
[05:46.67]Cancel it.
[05:48.69]I can cancel it.
[05:52.78]Just keep canceling and keep looking for players until I, like, get rid of all of you?
[06:04.31]How many people are playing this right now?
[06:06.27]Enough?
[06:06.63]Did I miss everything?
[06:07.53]Did I miss the boat?
[06:09.59]Oh, no.
[06:10.33]Did I miss the boat?
[06:14.45]I got...
[06:20.90]He got rid of us.
[06:29.58]Somebody gave 50 bucks.
[06:30.80]I have to say thank you.
[06:32.00]Thank you, weak cankles, for the $50.
[06:33.70]That's a huge amount of fucking money.
[06:37.43]Thank you.
[06:38.47]Am I gonna... Is something wrong with my computer?
[06:41.37]It happens a lot with connection errors.
[06:45.43]Wait, the servers are under maintenance?
[06:46.65]Oh, they're not?
[06:53.73]This is not like... Oh, are they?
[06:56.63]Do I have to do something else?
[06:58.61]Did I restart the game?
[07:03.11]Oh, no.
[07:06.80]The servers are down.
[07:08.48]What?
[07:10.52]Oh, fuck.
[07:12.54]No, they're not.
[07:13.06]Let me see.
[07:13.40]Wait.
[07:13.66]Fall Guys Twitter.
[07:17.80]I waited like seven days to play this.
[07:20.28]Fuck.
[07:23.77]Don't play on day one.
[07:24.55]It's gonna be overloaded.
[07:25.43]Don't play on day two.
[07:26.25]Everyone's gonna be really trying to play because, like, all the streamers and the YouTubers all played at the same time and everyone's playing at the same time and then, like, a week later, Jerma985 gets on the back of the rollercoaster and still fucked up.
[07:37.97]Is that- Let me see.
[07:38.75]Is that for real?
[07:39.29]Follow guys.
[07:40.97]Twitter.
[07:44.58]I don't see anything here.
[07:45.26]There's no scheduled maintenance.
[07:47.98]I'm just playing it again.
[07:48.58]I'm gonna try it again.
[07:53.83]I'm not playing TF2.
[07:55.73]If it doesn't work this time, I'll restart it.
[08:10.00]Put the gibbous on.
[08:11.68]No, I'm not putting the gibbous on.
[08:18.10]The servers are actually done.
[08:19.94]Oh, damn it.
[08:25.08]Are they really?
[08:27.36]No!
[08:38.01]Alright, I'm gonna reset the game.
[08:40.71]Hold on.
[08:41.59]Let's reset the game.
[08:42.51]Oh, that stinks.
[08:53.34]Did you just do a comb stream?
[08:55.34]Oh, I need to put on clothes if I do that.
[08:57.12]Hold on, let's try this again.
[09:02.64]Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[09:04.12]No, I'm not prepared for that one right now.
[09:05.84]Fall Guys.
[09:15.05]Well, I mean, I have a shitload of things installed.
[09:17.11]We could just, we could pivot.
[09:19.09]I mean, we could pivot pretty quickly here to the complex.
[09:22.83]Which is an FMV, choose your own adventure movie game.
[09:25.67]Made by the same people that made, uh, Silent Night, whatever it's called.
[09:30.81]What the fuck is that game?
[09:31.83]The one where you drive the car?
[09:33.81]The one where you, what's it called?
[09:35.38]It's not Silent Night.
[09:36.16]What is it called?
[09:37.96]Like, it's called, like, Tonight.
[09:40.02]What was it called?
[09:49.16]Night Shift, there it is, yeah.
[09:50.90]Made by the same people.
[09:57.39]Read this before you start.
[10:02.59]Yeah, the same people that made Late Shift made a new one.
[10:04.89]It's called The Complex.
[10:05.82]I don't think this is gonna work.
[10:19.85]Keep trying.
[10:20.21]It takes like five tries to get in.
[10:21.97]How popular is this game?
[10:25.31]Is this the most popular game ever?
[10:27.42]This has got to be the most popular game on Steam right now.
[10:29.46]It has to be, right?
[10:35.54]Two million sold on Steam.
[10:37.61]Oh my god.
[10:40.63]In like five days?
[10:49.14]You gotta be shitting me.
[10:53.15]125,000 players right now at 10 a.m.
[10:56.71]Holy shit.
[11:00.17]Well.
[11:06.52]Earn off your VPN.
[11:07.74]You think that's causing a problem?
[11:13.00]It shouldn't cause a problem.
[11:17.30]Yes, yes, yes.
[11:18.90]100%.
[11:19.40]No?
[11:24.44]No, that's not a problem.
[11:25.72]No.
[11:27.28]That's not an issue.
[11:28.50]That's lying.
[11:34.33]The servers are crashed.
[11:35.89]Alright, well, I don't want to just sit here and just stare at a guy falling for three hours.
[11:41.33]You guys do that already.
[11:42.93]I don't want to sit here and do it with you.
[11:52.54]Unable to find a match?
[11:53.62]What?
[11:53.97]Alright.
[11:56.51]I'm gonna... We're gonna give this a few minutes.
[12:01.53]Saw waiting room.
[12:02.79]No, no saw waiting room.
[12:04.04]Go read Yelp reviews.
[12:07.66]I don't know.
[12:07.94]I'm not gonna go read Yelp reviews.
[12:11.47]No.
[12:12.51]Go read Yelp reviews on stream.
[12:15.31]It's just, hey guys, all the Yelp, all the places and restaurants that I go to are going to drop by two stars because they're on stream.
[12:22.98]I'm not doing, I don't want to do that.
[12:24.04]Go for it one more time.
[12:33.80]Come on.
[12:34.30]Come on.
[12:34.60]Let's go.
[12:35.00]Come on.
[12:35.32]Turn the, like, just boot it back up.
[12:37.71]Turn it back on.
[12:38.89]Get a server back on.
[12:39.97]We can do this.
[12:40.95]We can.
[12:43.86]We.
[12:44.06]What do you mean we can do this?
[12:45.88]Who's the we in this scenario?
[12:47.44]I have nothing to do with this.
[12:48.56]And neither do any of you.
[12:50.70]This is somebody at an office or at a warehouse that has to like fix this.
[12:54.10]They're probably freaking out right now.
[12:55.98]This has nothing to do with me.
[12:56.98]Oh, we can do this, guys.
[12:59.75]What do you mean we?
[13:00.45]No, you can't.
[13:05.71]Warehouse?
[13:06.25]Yeah, this is where they get, where do you think they store all the computers?
[13:08.88]They store a bunch of computers in a fucking cold ice room.
[13:21.96]What are you, yes.
[13:27.33]Alright, I'm gonna pivot.
[13:28.63]We gotta pivot.
[13:29.41]Damn it, I wanted to fucking play this too.
[13:31.53]Shit.
[13:32.35]Alright, we're gonna pivot to the complex.
[13:34.39]I feel like that's- I wanna play it.
[13:37.89]It's a choose-your-own-movie game.
[13:39.68]You know we love those.
[13:45.82]Come back in an hour.
[13:46.64]We'll see how long- I think this- I think the complex is like an hour.
[13:50.42]So we're good, right?
[13:51.20]Let's go.
[13:54.14]I'll come back and try it in- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:59.40]What happened?
[13:59.82]Did I play?
[14:02.64]No.
[14:03.30]I'll come back in an hour.
[14:04.00]We're going to do the complex and I'm going to come back.
[14:08.08]Damn it.
[14:11.59]Complex is a 90 hour game.
[14:13.73]That's it's a 90 minute game.
[14:15.23]I think you read the second word wrong.
[14:19.83]I got to change my title.
[14:22.00]Shit.
[14:22.24]What am I?
[14:22.78]It takes me like two hours to come up with a title for a stream.
[14:25.22]How about like.
[14:27.85]movies um choose I don't know the servers are back don't do that to me servers are back no they're not are people around are they actually back can somebody please tell me that they're back

[14:58.27]Servers are back.
[14:59.33]They're back.
[14:59.69]They're actually back online.
[15:00.87]Actually online.
[15:02.13]This better not be a debate.
[15:03.11]I'm going to be really mad if it is.
[15:09.66]That's a lot of you are saying it.
[15:17.28]I mean, I opened the game.
[15:18.81]Is this real?
[15:19.35]Is this real?
[15:21.72]I'm in a game right now.

[15:30.85]Why did I open this again?
[15:31.97]What's the point?
[15:32.67]What's the point of this?
[15:33.45]This is a lie.
[15:34.17]Do a political stream.
[15:40.28]That's the last thing I'm going to do ever.
[15:42.92]No.
[15:43.70]Were you lying to me or what?

[16:16.56]And the guy behind the wheel is leaning forward with this wicked fucking angry face.
[16:22.71]And he's coming for me.
[16:24.07]And I'm just sitting there talking to you guys.
[16:25.57]And you're going to be like, turn around, there's a guy with a fucking gun.
[16:28.25]I'm not even going to fucking listen to you.
[16:33.68]I'm never listening to you guys ever again.
[16:34.76]I mean, wicked, what?
[16:38.48]Alright, we're going to do... Okay, this is just a movie.
[16:43.39]I don't even know what this movie game is about.
[16:44.59]We're going to play it.
[16:46.67]I'm naming this stream Complex.
[16:48.26]Who cares?
[16:49.82]Nobody cares about the title.
[16:51.00]It doesn't matter.
[16:51.74]I do.
[16:59.92]Hey, the shippers are back online!
[17:04.51]They could be.
[17:08.19]Let's see if this game's any good.
[17:11.27]When did this come out?
[17:22.89]Turn off your fucking VPN.
[17:27.70]Servers are up.
[17:29.62]Maybe I don't want to play this.
[17:36.02]I wasn't ready for this one.
[17:37.89]I ironically took... Alright, I'm turning... Alright, no.
[17:42.45]No, no, I'm moving on.
[17:43.81]Let's go.
[17:47.61]Turn off your VPN.
[17:49.43]Alright.
[17:50.35]No, it's not real.
[17:52.33]It's not real.
[17:53.09]You're fucking me up.
[17:56.09]No, they're not.
[17:56.71]Alright, I'm opening this game.
[17:59.87]Turn off your VPN.
[18:01.19]Pepe left.
[18:01.77]Don't turn it off.
[18:02.41]Don't fall for it.
[18:07.78]I don't want to play the complex.
[18:09.28]What do I play instead?
[18:10.68]I don't want to do this right now.
[18:17.44]Open up AI dungeon.
[18:19.46]Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[18:23.78]That's not a terrible idea.
[18:27.62]Either that or Nancy Drew.
[18:28.93]I'm ready to go full on fucking just Nancy Drew.
[18:46.72]Let me see.
[18:47.08]Is AI Dungeon in the same spot that it was before?
[18:49.42]Or do I have to do that thing again?
[19:01.11]Wait, I said the word Nancy Drew.
[19:02.83]God damn it, didn't I?
[19:09.97]Let me just do this.
[19:12.96]So the AI dungeon.io, is that a better version than the other one before?
[19:17.73]Remember how it was kind of not as good as the other one?
[19:19.65]That like kind of Google Doc one, whatever it was?
[19:23.18]So it's good now.
[19:26.43]Let me just put this on.
[19:36.21]How is Jerma985 emotionally today?
[19:38.41]Good or bad?
[19:39.39]Well, it started good and then I couldn't play the game that I wanted to play and it just threw a wrench into my window.
[19:44.61]And so now I have to figure out what I'm going to do.
[19:48.25]And that's how it happens.
[19:53.67]End of the stream voice.
[19:55.07]No.
[19:56.27]I should have been more prepared to have a backup.
[20:00.69]Alright, let me get this going.
[20:02.69]Can I capture this?
[20:07.06]I need to have, like, music and shit.
[20:08.30]Hold on, what is this?
[20:11.92]It's because I changed this stupid thing.
[20:25.69]Alright, I have to open up a game.
[20:26.92]I can't capture this window right now.
[20:28.28]I changed a bunch of dumb shit around.
[20:30.48]I'm just gonna, I'm just opening up Nancy Drew.
[20:32.22]I don't even care.
[20:34.48]I don't even, I don't even know what one is installed.
