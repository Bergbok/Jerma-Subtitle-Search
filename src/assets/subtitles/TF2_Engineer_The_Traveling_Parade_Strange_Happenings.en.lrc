[00:06.92]Bye.
[00:08.43]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[00:09.77]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight, gonna be playing as the Engineer.
[00:17.32]The title, I'll explain the title in a second, but I'll give you the loadout.
[00:20.40]The loadout is gonna be the Strange Frontier Justice, the Wrangler, and the Strange Wrench.
[00:26.47]Now, this gameplay is not the best in the world.
[00:29.11]I don't even think I make it onto the leaderboard, but that's not why I made the video.
[00:33.75]I made this video to show you guys the Parade of Traveling Engineers.
[00:38.40]Now what the hell does that mean?
[00:39.70]What is a traveling parade of engineers?
[00:42.24]Well, as you will see, I'm going to cut around in this gameplay.
[00:44.90]This is not really a gameplay to show you massive killstreaks and stuff like that.
[00:49.15]There's a lot of funny things that happen in this, so I really just had to make a video on it.
[00:54.76]So this is Badwater.
[00:55.88]This is the last point on Badwater.
[00:58.02]And as a lot of you guys know, there are two great places for sentry guns here.
[01:02.57]One across the way, as you see to the right, and over here on the left.
[01:05.87]So take a look at this engineer right here.
[01:07.79]So I say, all right, this is fine.
[01:09.05]You know, two sentries, whatever, we'll deal with it.
[01:10.83]And then, hey, yo, well, hello.
[01:14.29]We now have three sentries over here, and the right side is bare.
[01:18.64]And I decide, I say, okay, this can't happen.
[01:21.18]I have to try and do a risky maneuver.
[01:22.58]I grab the sentry and make a run for the right side.
[01:26.00]I end up getting over there unscathed.
[01:29.28]Fast forwarding about 40 seconds here, and as you'll see, the sentry is built up to level 3, and I have a dispenser here now.
[01:35.98]So I'm okay.
[01:37.12]I got the wrangler, pull it out, deal with a pesky soldier.
[01:40.26]And things are looking up.
[01:41.45]You know, they're almost at the point, but I got a good sentry here, got a good position.
[01:44.95]I'm not worried about a thing.
[01:46.69]And then here comes...
[01:53.27]The Traveling Parade of Engineers!
[01:56.07]With their two sentries in the same spot as mine.
[01:59.35]And I go... Okay, I'll help you build it.
[02:04.14]And let me get me out of here.
[02:05.02]Quick, quick, go, go, go, go, go!
[02:06.22]I try to get over to the other side again, the side where I just was less than a minute and a half ago.
[02:11.12]And so now there's a sniper shooting at me, and I'm freaking out, trying to jump all over the place and crouch and stuff, because I don't want to get killed.
[02:17.85]So less than 10 seconds go by, and look what happens.
[02:20.89]This dude comes over, drops one right next to mine again, and this is where I kind of just give up.
[02:25.61]I say, whatever.
[02:26.55]We'll do a double defense.
[02:28.37]I'm not going to sit here.
[02:29.16]I'm not going to bring my sentry all over the place.
[02:31.06]There's four engineers on the team now.
[02:33.36]So if you take a look over there, I go, oh, whatever.
[02:39.22]And this is the part of the gameplay when things all fall apart and I just start to turn on my troll mode.
[02:45.09]Now not on my own team of course, I'm talking about the other team.
[02:48.39]I start to build sentries in just odd places, places that could be really easily destroyed.
[02:53.95]Taking out my shotgun, trying to get some crit shots into people, and I actually do get a pretty good one coming up here.
[03:00.10]so this is troll century number one I think this is actually the one and only troll century in this particular gameplay so I bring it up here trying to get in a spot where it'll guaranteed kill anyone that walks up to there and remember I have the wrangler so it's just me being a real jerk being a real bastard just shooting people with the wrangler as they walk by smack that spy a couple times get the kill on it and then look at this look at the traveling parade of engineers over here
[03:25.07]I want to briefly explain to maybe some of the newer guys that don't know what I'm talking about, but the reason why that is a bad idea is if an Uber Demoman comes around that corner, it's only going to take him probably five seconds to destroy every single building over there.
[03:41.20]Because you've got to remember, it only takes three stickies to destroy a level three sentry gun.
[03:46.10]And the Demoman in his sticky launcher has eight stickies.
[03:49.07]So all he really has to do is turn that corner and just start...
[03:53.43]just spamming stickies all over the place and he will take out everything.
[03:58.09]So a good rule of thumb is to always stay at least 10 maybe 15 feet away from the nearest engineer and his sentry gun.
[04:06.12]Now I know that sometimes that really just is not possible.
[04:08.98]The situation you just saw earlier is a great example of that.
[04:12.30]If there's at least three or four engineers on a team, you're gonna be sharing space with people.
[04:17.33]But if you can at least make a conscious effort to stay as far away from each other as possible, you're just giving your team a better chance of victory.
[04:25.02]So this century goes down.
[04:27.22]Not big surprise.
[04:29.52]Oh, heavy cameo right there.
[04:30.84]Thanks a lot, heavy.
[04:31.60]I appreciate it.
[04:32.62]You are very welcome.
[04:35.14]Apparently the heavy is General Grievous from Star Wars.
[04:39.50]That was a terrible heavy impression.
[04:41.76]You got anything else for us, heavy?
[04:43.76]I am going to add your engineer wrench to my collection.
[04:48.98]What the hell am I doing right now?
[04:52.10]Like, I'm recording this and listening back to it.
[04:54.60]What am I doing?
[04:56.88]Anyways, get the nice revenge shot on that, Medic, and I see that this engineer has built up a wrangled sentry, and I'm going to do something about it.
[05:05.91]So right when he goes to repair it, I'm watching him, watching him.
[05:08.51]There he goes.
[05:09.13]I run at him.
[05:09.83]He must have been like, what the hell are you doing?
[05:12.17]Get the kill on him right there, but his sentry obviously turns around and blows me to hell.
[05:18.03]So this is the end of the gameplay here, guys.
[05:19.69]Got a sentry built up in overtime.
[05:22.38]And it kills a few people, but that's not the reason why I'm showing you the end here.
[05:25.72]I don't get on the leaderboard, like I say, but there's one little clip here at the end where I shoot a Demoman that sticky jumped across the map.
[05:32.34]And I was laughing so hard, I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen.
[05:36.14]So this is gonna be the end of the gameplay here, guys.
[05:37.93]Thank you so much for watching.
[05:39.51]I really do appreciate it.
[05:40.85]And I will see you guys all next time.
[05:42.76]Take care, everybody.
