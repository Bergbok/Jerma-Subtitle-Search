[01:42.82]Hi.
[01:44.06]Good morning, everybody.
[01:45.06]Did I accidentally hit the stream button?
[01:49.99]No.
[01:51.15]I did not accidentally hit the stream button.
[01:55.29]Although that would make sense.
[01:56.99]I can see how that could make a lot of sense.
[02:00.25]Nope.
[02:01.01]We are streaming right now.
[02:02.79]I was supposed to stream later, but you know, it's Mother's Day.
[02:07.04]And I've got stuff to do later.
[02:10.16]With my mother.
[02:11.82]Happy Mother's Day, by the way, to all of you mothers out there.
[02:16.03]Or, you know, to all of your moms.
[02:19.61]Make sure you say Happy Mother's Day.
[02:21.55]And get a card, goddammit.
[02:23.31]Your mother loves you, goddammit.
[02:24.67]Get a card!
[02:28.10]Anyways, yeah.
[02:28.94]We're going to play Immortal Redneck.
[02:34.33]It's one of those games that's a rogue-lite first-person shooter set in Egypt.
[02:39.75]You play a redneck.
[02:41.05]That's all I know.
[02:41.71]Let's get rid of this, though.
[02:46.68]Turn this on.
[02:47.84]Hey, there's new music.
[02:51.20]And let's bring you over here.
[02:53.96]Hi.
[02:55.28]So, there apparently is Twitch integration.
[03:02.19]Twitch integration.
[03:03.61]I don't really know what this means, but if for some reason I really enjoy playing this game, if I'm having like a lot of fun, then why the hell not?
[03:12.23]Like maybe, maybe I'll stream it again and we'll do the Twitch thing.
[03:19.63]We shall see.
[03:21.97]Anywho, let's get going.
[03:26.33]Let me move one thing and we'll just get started.
[03:30.62]And I'm going to move this and that and this and that.
[03:36.06]How's the audio?
[03:36.82]Audio's probably fine.
[03:38.88]Audio's fine.
[03:39.84]Maybe it could be turned up a tad.
[03:41.74]We'll see.
[03:43.84]Okay.
[03:44.24]Here we go.
[03:45.36]Play.
[03:48.03]I don't know any of the controls.
[03:49.07]I don't know.
[03:49.53]And I just turned it down.
[03:50.55]I just turned it up.
[03:51.85]There are.
[03:52.15]I need to go get the laundry.
[03:56.05]Don't do anything yet.
[03:56.93]This sensitivity is way too high already.
[04:02.41]FOV is 90.
[04:03.09]That's fine.
[04:05.25]Control mouse sensitivity.
[04:06.76]You gotta go down, man.
[04:10.06]Confirm those settings.
[04:13.00]Okay.
[04:15.38]Tutorial.
[04:16.34]Let's learn how to play this game.
[04:17.61]Alright.
[04:22.57]This is actually... This, like, kind of feels kind of good.
[04:27.41]Space is jump.
[04:29.18]Alright.
[04:32.17]I hit right cliff.
[04:33.78]I hit right cliff.
[04:35.92]Shift is obviously sprint.
[04:37.62]You move real fast and you sprint jump.
[04:40.78]I see.
[04:41.54]Cool.
[04:42.91]And there's a fucking Skeletor.
[04:44.11]Okay.
[04:46.49]You can grab ledges.
[04:49.09]Chests.
[04:50.81]Gold coins.
[04:52.42]Don't know what those do.
[04:57.11]Reminds me of Serious Sam.
[04:58.17]Hold on, let me... It is a little loud.
[05:00.19]Let's bring it.
[05:01.83]Let's bring her down a little.
[05:03.49]Okay.
[05:05.96]Uh, yeah.
[05:06.40]Left mouse is shoot.
[05:09.68]Obviously, right?
[05:12.72]Cool.
[05:17.78]Got it.
[05:21.09]And... Items?
[05:23.01]What is that?
[05:23.75]I don't know.
[05:25.80]R is reload.
[05:26.50]I have 6 out of 52.
[05:27.56]There's a guy.
[05:28.14]That's a dead guy now.
[05:33.03]Pretty sick.
[05:33.45]Triforce, aim, rectical.
[05:35.11]I agree.
[05:38.85]This makes me think of Serious Sam.
[05:40.68]It does.
[05:41.56]Hold right mouse button.
[05:45.52]And then click.
[05:46.76]I guess it's like a... Uh...
[05:54.08]Hold right and left.
[05:55.92]I mean, I guess... I'm not exactly sure what that did.
[06:00.26]Didn't really do much.
[06:02.75]Holding left mouse button shoots.
[06:04.41]Like, faster though.
[06:07.07]That's steak.
[06:10.09]And... Fucking supply drop.
[06:20.02]What does that do?
[06:21.56]I can't...
[06:23.50]I don't know.
[06:24.02]Whatever.
[06:25.14]Interact is E. I have two other weapons apparently.
[06:30.87]Yeah, I saw on the top right.
[06:32.55]Just doing the tutorial.
[06:34.73]Redneck's active ability allows you to shoot faster.
[06:37.15]That's all it means.
[06:39.63]So what is two?
[06:40.19]Two is a shotgun?
[06:43.89]Cool.
[06:45.94]Oh, you can move pretty damn fast.
[06:47.84]Alright.
[06:54.93]I love these little characters.
[06:56.07]These things are so stupid.
[06:57.07]They're like little dinosaurs.
[06:59.56]I don't think I should waste that.
[07:00.82]I probably should hold on to this.
[07:06.36]Still a monster in here.
[07:12.56]Roadhog shotgun.
[07:15.91]What's left?
[07:16.91]Still one more?
[07:18.31]Where?
[07:20.25]Where are you?
[07:20.89]There you are.
[07:25.36]I got the mini map in the top left.
[07:27.36]It's just dinosaur week all over again.
[07:33.62]Oh shit, there's like moving sarcophagi.
[07:36.28]That's right, you didn't think I knew what the fucking term was.
[07:39.50]I know it's called sarcophagi.
[07:44.40]What is this, dynamite?
[07:45.46]That's kind of cool.
[07:54.71]Mmm, meat, meat, meat.
[07:56.00]This is a fast-paced shooter.
[07:56.96]I gotta move faster.
[08:02.34]You got me out of bed for this.
[08:03.60]It better be good.
[08:04.64]Oh, shit, I better be good then.
[08:09.04]What do we got left?
[08:09.90]I'm assuming the bar in the top is what's left in the room, right?
[08:15.09]Or is that not the case?
[08:16.61]Although, like, can I, like, parkour up there?
[08:20.77]I think I need to do that.
[08:24.29]Holy shit, I do have to do that.
[08:25.31]Okay.
[08:26.09]Well, there's people up there.
[08:32.34]Don't throw things at me.
[08:35.22]Low ammo shit.
[08:36.40]Okay.
[08:36.70]Goddamn.
[08:47.99]Yeah, I hope there's no fall damage.
[08:50.72]Oh god.
[08:51.18]This is so this is gonna be hard.
[08:52.66]This is gonna be hard So it looks like I can go I gotta go all the way up that way to scale that.
[08:59.12]Okay.
[08:59.48]Well, let's just go for that jump off champ It's actually fairly scary doing this because I know I'll just blow this I
[09:18.19]No more ammo.
[09:20.75]Where's the store?
[09:21.85]I gotta find the store.
[09:22.58]So this is like Binding of Isaac.
[09:23.74]There's like a store.
[09:30.20]Shit, I shouldn't have done that.
[09:31.04]I gotta keep going up.
[09:33.08]Or is... No, wait.
[09:33.82]Maybe I don't.
[09:36.02]Is there any like secrets?
[09:36.88]I mean, you can keep going that way.
[09:39.91]What is up there?
[09:40.41]Nothing?
[09:43.01]I think the doors are open.
[09:45.11]Yeah, the doors are open.
[09:46.94]Is there fall damage in this game?
[09:51.16]I don't know.
[09:52.88]Should we find out?
[09:54.06]No.
[09:54.26]Okay, that was kind of like... Okay, here's the place to test it.
[10:00.52]No, there's definitely no fall damage if that didn't hurt.
[10:03.83]Alright, that goes back that way.
[10:04.87]Let's keep going.
[10:08.31]Is there nothing else in here?
[10:11.41]Is this just a dead room?
[10:12.67]Really?
[10:14.43]Well, okay.
[10:20.21]We're going up.
[10:20.75]There's two ways to go.
[10:26.94]We're going to go this way.
[10:29.06]But, fuck, man.
[10:29.94]I don't have any more ammo.
[10:31.92]Where do I get ammo?
[10:37.36]Is that ammo?
[10:38.65]I think it was.
[10:39.21]Yeah, it was.
[10:39.63]Okay, so the blue box is the ammo.
[10:41.69]Good to know.
[10:46.81]These are precious shots that I'm wasting here.
[10:50.69]Let's go over there.
[10:54.49]Oh, really?
[10:54.97]Did he just say fuck?
[10:56.51]Oh, fuck.
[11:00.05]I'm just going to run over here.
[11:01.82]That was a crit.
[11:02.54]Give me that ammo.
[11:07.28]This is pretty fun jumping around.
[11:08.70]I'm not going to lie.
[11:09.44]Don't fall in the fucking acid, though.
[11:18.36]Because I will fall in this acid, and it'll ruin my life.
[11:20.82]Alright, that's it.
[11:23.30]Oh god, wait, is this a boss?
[11:24.10]Is this a guy with a chain that's gonna come off?
[11:27.76]Is it gonna be a boss?
[11:32.29]No, it's not.
[11:32.77]I got $370.
[11:35.07]What a sharpshooter.
[11:39.07]Jesus, the enemies are so cute, and this guy just said, fuck, what is this game's rating?
[11:43.80]Maybe he didn't say fuck.
[11:45.16]Maybe it was just like, ah!
[11:48.56]Maybe it's like one of those.
[11:50.61]Let's go up.
[11:56.57]Okay.
[11:57.43]I kind of like how you have to get rid of everything.
[11:59.86]I do like that.
[12:00.86]It makes it more interesting.
[12:02.58]It's like Isaac in a way.
[12:03.84]Let's wrap around.
[12:07.75]And shotgun this guy right in the back.
[12:14.24]I'm gonna assume there's probably new items and weapons and upgrades and stuff.
[12:17.36]Apparently there's a skill tree.
[12:20.36]Apparently there is a skill tree.
[12:25.48]And this is just the first level, so I'm gonna assume this is... Plentiful.
[12:31.20]Increases your attack if you have full health.
[12:36.65]Alright, well that... I don't have full health, but, you know...
[12:44.17]I guess.
[12:45.91]Where's this last guy?
[12:46.85]Oh, they're up top.
[12:49.94]Shit.
[12:50.28]Really?
[12:52.72]Is there a way to get up there?
[12:53.60]Does it move?
[12:56.88]It does move.
[12:57.54]Okay.
[12:58.44]It moves.
[12:59.56]Shotgun.
[13:01.93]Fireman.
[13:02.37]Explosions do more damage even to yourself.
[13:06.03]Great.
[13:06.33]I'm gonna like fucking die here.
[13:17.13]Yeah, you can have chat interact and vote on what happens in the game.
[13:19.78]Really?
[13:22.28]Alright, that's fucking really cool.
[13:28.46]Alright, uh... I believe that's it.
[13:31.24]There's no door up here, so we're gonna go down.
[13:33.42]Oh, damn it.
[13:37.69]No, go back down.
[13:39.61]Okay, that's like... Back this way?
[13:43.49]Yeah, sure, why not.
[13:46.61]Alright, that's a thing on the mini-map.
[13:48.13]I don't know what that is.
[13:51.44]But we're going to go to it.
[13:54.48]Oh, is it like a chest?
[13:57.42]Alright, well, we have to see what that is.
[14:02.14]It involves modding a bot for the game and stuff?
[14:04.28]Really?
[14:06.90]Well, if I really enjoy this game, then of course I'm going to want to keep playing it.
[14:10.88]We'll do the Twitch thing.
[14:11.67]It'll be fun.
[14:14.22]What do you got?
[14:14.66]Health?
[14:15.16]Another scroll.
[14:16.59]Wall Street Wolf.
[14:17.45]Doubles your money, but you lose 75% of your current health.
[14:22.71]I don't know about that.
[14:24.75]Fine.
[14:26.51]Shit.
[14:29.47]I love how I said, I don't know about that, and then I just fucking took it anyways.
[14:33.63]Well.
[14:36.99]Alright.
[14:38.99]Maybe that wasn't such a great idea.
[14:43.12]But I do have a lot of money.
[14:44.08]I don't know what that's for, though.
[14:51.28]Uh... Movie reference.
[14:54.16]Make money, spend money.
[14:55.06]You're already dead.
[14:55.98]I... I mean, this is the first time I've ever played it, so... I'm just gonna assume I'm gonna lose anyways.
[15:01.88]Or maybe not yet.
[15:09.64]Maybe not.
[15:10.66]If I can find more health, I'll be fine.
[15:16.52]Holy shit, you take a lot of damage.
[15:22.78]Cluster trucks?
[15:23.68]What do you mean?
[15:25.39]This is like cluster trucks?
[15:28.55]Whoa!
[15:29.81]Where did you even come from?
[15:30.73]Are these enemies right here?
[15:33.83]No, those are just fucking hanging skeletons.
[15:38.04]Use the TNT.
[15:43.04]Damn it.
[15:43.84]No health.
[15:46.81]Uh, I guess we're going to keep going this way.
[15:52.39]Why so early?
[15:53.09]Because I woke up really early.
[15:55.37]And by really early, I mean extraordinarily early.
[15:58.76]And it's Mother's Day.
[15:59.72]So I can't, I'm not going to stream later.
[16:02.74]So again, if you're just trickling in, happy Mother's Day.
[16:05.58]And watch out for the fucking toads.
[16:08.34]Jesus Christ, there's so many toads.
[16:12.07]Oh, fuck.
[16:13.72]What a fucking funny toad joke.
[16:15.90]Alright, I gotta be quiet.
[16:22.06]Shit.
[16:23.26]Alright, fuck you frogs.
[16:24.80]This shit was in the Bible.
[16:29.08]Remember in the Bible when fucking Jebediah threw dynamite at the toads?
[16:39.01]Actually, that was very useful.
[16:40.81]Still no health though.
[16:46.63]Whoa!
[16:52.10]God damn, that was actually fucking scary.
[16:57.66]Oh, I have 15 health.
[16:59.28]How do I get health?
[17:05.97]Happy Mother's Day.
[17:06.71]Oh, you did a short joke.
[17:09.01]I'm not reading that one.
[17:10.01]Alright, I might die in this room.
[17:14.97]Mission, don't get hurt.
[17:16.13]What?
[17:17.68]Well, I can't get hurt.
[17:18.94]Otherwise, I'm gonna lose.
[17:19.66]Wait.
[17:22.10]You mean, like... Do I have to, like, log roll these things?
[17:33.21]I think I have to do, like, the jokey log roll.
[17:37.86]Yep.
[17:42.26]My two... Whoa!
[17:43.58]Whoa!
[17:49.42]Yes, okay health ammo come on more health a crowbar oh That's a new item Your attack increases as long as you don't miss a shot I Don't do it do I want this?
[18:11.39]I'm not sure I want that
[18:15.48]I just, I don't know why I right, did the right cliff, uh, right, uh, Tony Clifton.
[18:21.58]Mmm.
[18:25.08]I don't think I want to get rid of any of these.
[18:28.12]Do I want to get that fucking close?
[18:29.44]I have 30 health.
[18:30.21]That's not a good idea.
[18:32.11]What's the ding?
[18:32.65]Who dinged?
[18:33.21]Why'd you ding?
[18:37.39]Nah, I don't think I want it.
[18:38.49]Not, like, the first playthrough.
[18:39.75]Unless, like, anybody that's played this game, a melee weapon's, like, fucking crazy or what?
[18:48.02]Mmm... I'm... I'm gonna... Alright, let's take it.
[18:58.79]Whatever.
[18:59.67]We'll try it.
[19:00.77]So, there's a door straight ahead over here.
[19:04.57]They're dog shit, but it has infinite ammo.
[19:06.53]That is true.
[19:07.01]Alright, let's just test it.
[19:17.71]Alright, that looks like a Dane.
[19:19.09]That's a boss.
[19:20.75]This is a boss room, I think.
[19:25.79]I think that might be... That's like a GLaDOS enemy.
[19:27.73]Alright, let's bash this dinosaur's brains in.
[19:31.48]What's the range on it?
[19:33.72]This thing actually... I'm okay with this, actually.
[19:39.32]I'm really okay with this.
[19:40.66]This is fucking... I lost.
[19:56.81]Hey, alright, hold on, hold on.
[20:01.95]You're supposed to die!
[20:03.83]Cause look, look at, everybody just shut up for a second, okay?
[20:08.39]Everybody just shut it.
[20:10.12]I was supposed to die right there because look, attack upgrade, base attack, I have all that money.
[20:14.22]Everybody just shut it for a second.
[20:19.14]So there, see?
[20:22.84]Oh, this is cool.
[20:24.02]This is fucking cool.
[20:27.78]Increases the amount of ammo picked up.
[20:31.40]Everybody... Everybody shut it!
[20:36.85]Two defense.
[20:39.25]Obtain ape as favor level three.
[20:41.15]Let me just... I want that.
[20:47.68]Okay, this is... Temporary invincibility.
[20:51.06]You can carry four weapons, but can only do one consecutive jump.
[20:55.22]Fuck that.
[20:56.42]No thanks.
[21:05.03]I want more attack, and this is just more ammo.
[21:11.45]Somebody just said, I'm unfollowing.
[21:12.91]Don't do that.
[21:13.55]I was just kidding.
[21:14.33]I was just kidding.
[21:15.33]Don't worry.
[21:18.29]We'll do this a couple times.
[21:27.01]We'll do base defense, and then even more shit to think about.
[21:32.70]Card level 4.
[21:36.44]The merchant is open for business.
[21:38.28]Oh, fuck.
[21:39.26]So I get a merchant at 1500 now.
[21:43.18]I'm going to do this one more time because I want to see what this is.
[21:46.28]Seth.
[21:47.76]Throws an electric ball that inflicts damage as it increases and decreases in size.
[21:52.41]Enemies receive damage when hitting you.
[21:54.99]Weapons.
[21:55.39]And you start with a new weapon set.
[21:56.81]Oh, okay.
[21:57.49]You start with a new weapon set here.
[21:58.77]Oh.
[22:00.25]Oh.
[22:00.35]Oh.

[22:04.84]Nice.
[22:05.38]Okay, cool.
[22:06.78]Do you guys see?
[22:07.76]Alright, I'm interested now this this is this is really cool.
[22:13.28]This is really interesting.
[22:14.28]Nice.
[22:14.58]Got it.
[22:16.08]So now we're just stronger just by the get go.
[22:18.74]And we're like in a hub world now.
[22:22.61]This is obviously the shop.
[22:26.05]This is the statue of fucking Zeus with his two candy canes.
[22:29.82]If you guys didn't know, Zeus was a candy maker and his lightning comes from his magical candy canes.
[22:38.99]And there's fucking Cerberus.
[22:42.17]There's the other head of Cerberus.
[22:43.59]There's three heads of Cerberus.
[22:44.73]Where's the third one?
[22:45.35]I don't know.
[22:55.91]Come on, give me, what is this?
[22:57.29]What is this?
[22:57.93]Oh yeah, what is this tree?
[22:58.99]What's this mo- ah, comedy!
[23:00.79]What's this moon well from World of Warcraft?
[23:04.05]Everybody just shut it for a second!
[23:06.05]Alright, I'm going.
[23:10.59]I'm going, let's keep going.
[23:15.78]The gods claim your gold.
[23:17.38]Please them to enter the- Oh, you lose your money.
[23:21.36]You lose your money.
[23:22.50]Fucking taxes, man.
[23:24.02]Just like the fed fucking government.
[23:30.77]Okay, they could have eased up on the swear words a little, I think.
[23:37.29]He's in one of his moods.
[23:38.51]What are you talking about?
[23:43.01]Fucking taxes, man.
[23:44.97]Is it the same?
[23:46.39]Or is it procedures generated?
[23:53.61]Alright, that's fine.
[23:56.71]Somebody is shooting, like, raining hell right now.
[24:01.20]Oh, it's GLaDOS.
[24:12.42]Come here, GLaDOS.
[24:13.20]Uh, you want first impressions so far?
[24:20.19]Yeah.
[24:22.53]Like, yeah.
[24:23.63]So far, yeah.
[24:26.65]We'll see if it holds its charm for long, right?
[24:29.43]Whoa.
[24:31.95]Low ammo already.
[24:34.57]Wish I had a fucking taser sword.
[24:35.99]Wish I had a fucking... I'm not talking about this guy swearing and listening to me.
[24:42.44]Damn it.
[24:46.56]All that ammo.
[24:47.18]Where's the ammo store?
[24:51.26]IGN says, so far, yeah.
[25:00.04]Don't shoot it.
[25:00.52]Don't shoot it.
[25:01.18]Right over his head.
[25:06.01]And last guy.
[25:07.83]Ooh, he's down there.
[25:09.85]Going right by my face.
[25:10.91]Alright.
[25:18.24]Is the game audio too low?
[25:19.56]I can turn it up if that's an issue.
[25:21.55]Let me try this.
[25:25.01]Let's just do this.
[25:25.97]Is that better?
[25:42.34]Sub audio is too low too.
[25:43.78]That's from OBS Studio.
[25:47.13]Check the Twitch tab.
[25:47.99]Yeah, actually, eventually here, I am going to want to do that.
[25:53.44]But I think I have to get a bunch of stuff ready.
[25:55.44]I think I have to get a bot downloaded to do that.
[25:57.98]So that might have to be for another day.
[26:00.17]I didn't want to go through all the trouble of setting up Twitch integration with this game and have me open it and be like, this game sucks, and that would be wasted effort, right?
[26:14.39]Mm-hmm.
[26:16.65]Ow.
[26:18.11]Why am I saying ow?
[26:18.69]I didn't even get hit.
[26:20.51]This is a pretty claustrophobic room, though.
[26:22.91]I'm throwing dynamite in here.
[26:23.89]Fuck it.
[26:24.15]Did I get that guy?
[26:28.01]I got one.
[26:33.83]Oh, baby.
[26:36.16]Oh, baby.
[26:45.32]Oh, come on.
[26:45.78]Alright, fuck it.
[26:46.38]We're doing more dynamite.
[26:49.36]Ren's back.
[26:50.90]Shit.
[26:51.96]The shotgun, like, sucks in this situation.
[26:59.18]God damn it.
[27:00.66]Oh my god.
[27:01.14]This is so... Can I give me a break?
[27:06.98]What the fuck, dude?
[27:08.36]What?
[27:09.70]What?
[27:10.06]What?
[27:11.68]What?
[27:14.49]Die!
[27:15.25]What in the name of fucking God?
[27:16.86]Does a shotgun suck that much asshole?
[27:19.42]What?
[27:22.80]Like, you gotta be kidding me.
[27:24.86]Every single particle went around his body.
[27:27.44]Give me a fucking break.
[27:43.40]I want to go over here.
[27:51.30]I really want more ammo for this gun.
[27:53.91]This gun is like... I like this gun.
[27:58.69]I like the precision aiming.
[27:59.85]I'm a precision gamer.
[28:00.99]I'm not like one of those stupid idiots that use a big blast that misses everything.
[28:05.51]I'm a precision gamer.
[28:06.61]You know, back when I was fucking in my teen years...
[28:12.01]When I was a video game champion, they called me the surgeon.
[28:17.25]And I like the esports commentators who are like... For instance, I'll give you a little glimpse of what I'm talking about here.
[28:22.89]For instance, like... It's right there.
[28:26.63]See that?
[28:27.49]Right in the corner.
[28:29.01]See that?
[28:29.35]I just did that.
[28:29.87]And I was like, I was trying to hit the corner.
[28:31.63]And they used to call me the fucking surgeon.
[28:37.37]Is anything else even in here?
[28:39.13]I want to see a bigger picture of the map.
[28:42.51]No chests or anything?
[28:43.39]Really?
[28:47.01]Uh... Well, alright, let's go this way.
[28:52.68]Ooh, this is an interesting room.
[28:57.50]So, like, watch this.
[28:58.08]Ready?
[28:58.30]They just caught me.
[28:58.92]Alright, I'm just... Eat this, you fat
[29:11.47]Oh no!
[29:12.39]Don't go in there.
[29:16.46]I only want to shoot this gun.
[29:18.16]I don't like the shotgun.
[29:19.22]I really don't.
[29:25.42]Tab the map?
[29:26.14]Thank you.
[29:26.46]These guys are like hanging upside down on the walls.
[29:38.79]This is why they call me the fucking surgeon.
[29:40.91]I'm gonna get this guy right in his tootsie.
[29:54.30]These people are in the weirdest fucking place.
[29:57.28]Alright, screw this.
[30:01.22]If there's ever a place to use the dynamite, it's probably right here.
[30:04.16]Just easy kill.
[30:14.65]What was it 1500 to get that uh the shop Yeah, and the eSports commentator like at the time I Mean he was like a legend.
[30:28.13]I forget what his name was, but he was like a one of those legendary eSports commentators and Like he used to like one of his trademark lines Was first of all what happened?
[30:40.19]How do I get out of here?
[30:40.91]Oh?
[30:44.34]Oh, okay.
[30:44.80]Here we are.
[30:46.39]Like, anytime I do something crazy and I do, like, a spin around and shoot... He had this wicked cool line.
[30:53.41]And, like, it's unfortunate because he made, like, a bunch of money off me.
[30:56.57]You know what I mean?
[30:57.97]Like, he had this trademark line with, like, fucking... He sold, like, t-shirts and all that stuff.
[31:02.34]And, like, I'm okay with that.
[31:03.22]But, like, I mean, he made his entire income off of me.
[31:05.30]Like, I deserved at least, like, 60%, I think.
[31:10.95]But he did this thing where every time I'd get a cool shot, like for instance right now, he'd be like, Darwin, ladies and gentlemen, book your appointment!
[31:19.46]And he had it on t-shirts and shit.
[31:21.26]He was like, book your appointment because the surgeon just got you anesthesia!
[31:24.64]And it was on like fucking bumper stickers and stuff like that.
[31:28.62]And I really wanted some of the money.
[31:29.72]And I tried to sue him, but he threw acid in my face and I couldn't.
[31:40.39]I am in like a fucking weird mood right now guys.
[31:42.38]I'm sorry.
[31:43.52]I'm sorry.
[31:47.88]I am in a fairly odd mood right now.
[31:50.42]I will say.
[31:51.10]I don't know why.
[31:54.98]Sometimes you get weird.
[31:57.36]Look out.
[32:00.86]Sleep deprivation?
[32:01.84]No.
[32:03.38]I woke up not that long ago.
[32:05.84]Missed the money too.
[32:11.99]Where's this final... Where?
[32:15.50]What?
[32:18.86]Did I really just get hit by the fucking shitty character from Monsters, Inc.?
[32:21.80]Nice.
[32:25.33]I got Monsters, Inc'd.
[32:27.43]And I actually got hit by that.
[32:36.06]Getting to a lot of roads that lead to nowhere, unfortunately.
[32:42.11]Oh, I can go down.
[32:43.33]Let's go down.
[32:43.81]Let's just take a look.
[32:49.65]I mean, this is the original room, right?
[32:54.21]No, screw that.
[32:55.01]Let's go this way.
[33:00.05]Up here, yeah.
[33:03.95]Up, up, up, up, up.
[33:05.39]Play Outlast 2 again on the hard difficulty?
[33:07.64]No way.
[33:13.17]Just got way too close.
[33:21.62]Whoa!
[33:29.39]And that was it.
[33:33.13]I really do feel like I should be breaking these.
[33:34.63]Another dead end.
[33:37.05]Come on.
[33:38.17]Yeah, happy Mother's Day.
[33:40.52]Oh, but I need to ask this, by the way.
[33:42.66]So those of you that are watching right now that have been watching my streams for a, you know, a good little while here.
[33:49.29]Does the stream look any better?
[33:53.52]Does the stream look any better?
[33:55.98]Is there a discernible difference between like the streams the last few days and the streams like a week or two ago?
[34:03.26]Like in regards to quality.
[34:08.62]Because I was able to drop... You know, yes, yes, yes.
[34:13.00]Looks streamier.
[34:14.46]I hope that means good.
[34:19.79]Shit.
[34:22.21]Oh my god.
[34:22.99]I'm gonna die.
[34:29.34]That doesn't dead end.
[34:30.16]I'm okay.
[34:32.46]Okay.
[34:35.27]Yeah, but it's been less shitty games.
[34:38.23]That is true.
[34:39.91]But this is a new computer and it's a six core processor.
[34:44.05]So I'm able to drop my preset on Twitch to a much better preset for rendering purposes.
[34:53.12]So there you go.
[34:56.64]I might be able to do it even more.
[34:59.26]I might be able to drop the preset again and increase the quality again.
[35:05.78]Maybe.
[35:06.52]I don't know if I want to push it that hard as of yet.
[35:10.02]Six cores to play Rat Simulator.
[35:12.96]Actually, here's the funny thing, guys.
[35:14.70]I was going to just play Rat Simulator again and just pretend like I was really into it and just have you guys be like, you fucking idiot.
[35:23.77]What is going on here?
[35:25.57]Are they spawning behind me?
[35:28.63]I don't like this little hallway.
[35:30.18]Oh, shit!
[35:40.13]Dammit, what am I doing?
[35:41.44]What?
[35:45.40]My brain was just trying to do so many things right there.
[35:47.86]I could have just easily shot them, but I'm like... That was so stupid.
[35:53.92]That was so fucking dumb.
[36:02.41]I was trying to, like, throw it down the hallway.
[36:04.83]But, uh, don't ask me.
[36:07.47]I'm fucking tired.
[36:09.87]Let's try one of these.
[36:12.25]I'm curious as to what this is.
[36:16.07]This is why, I didn't have enough health.
[36:18.91]How much is this?
[36:19.37]500?
[36:19.39]Alright, I can do... Let's do this.
[36:26.16]Let's do Seth.
[36:28.86]So it throws an electric ball.
[36:29.92]I got a taser sword, Tesla coil, and electric flamethrower.
[36:35.45]Let's do this again.
[36:37.85]Alright, um...
[36:41.08]So it's just an electric coil and then enemies receive damage when they touch you and I get a taser sword.
[36:48.32]This is fucking cool.
[36:50.92]So how do I like change into Seth?
[36:53.38]Because right now I'm like this guy.
[37:01.66]Do I have to like do something specific to turn into that?
[37:10.32]I don't know.
[37:12.47]I think I have to die.
[37:13.25]Do you think I have to kill myself to switch?
[37:15.39]Okay, well, let's just do that.
[37:18.68]Take my $1.
[37:19.10]I don't care.
[37:20.40]I'm just going to mug it and die.
[37:23.72]This is good.
[37:26.70]This is good.
[37:33.70]Let me guess.
[37:34.59]Mummy Dad put a seed in Mummy's coffin and...
[37:41.99]fucking taxes okay redneck or Seth Seth oh and they have different different HP different defense defense minus 10% what
[38:08.49]Does this guy have his own tree?
[38:11.62]Wait a minute.
[38:18.12]This is... That's awesome.
[38:21.34]What's the active ability?
[38:22.12]You... Wow.
[38:27.25]Alright, what about this?
[38:29.23]This is fucking cool.
[38:30.85]This game's a solid yes.
[38:32.03]Absolute solid yes.
[38:37.41]So far.
[38:38.23]What is this one?
[38:39.67]This is like an electric flamethrower?
[38:42.31]No fucking way, man.
[38:45.93]That's awesome.
[38:47.75]They don't have their own separate trees.
[38:49.10]Okay.
[38:53.90]That's what I needed to do.
[38:55.18]Everything refills, I'm assuming, when I go in the front door, right?
[39:01.34]I hope so.
[39:07.39]And the game's only 20 bucks.
[39:08.25]Alright.
[39:12.33]Let's give it a try.
[39:15.95]This is like melee and area.
[39:17.31]Let's try his laser gun first.
[39:21.58]Nice.
[39:22.58]I like.
[39:23.40]I hear frogs.
[39:24.10]I'm going to get my sword out to get rid of the frogs.
[39:29.84]But where are the frogs?
[39:35.22]I guess they're down in the hallway.
[39:36.20]There they are.
[39:38.47]No, they're in here.
[39:51.00]Oh, it ricochets off people too?
[39:52.86]Oh my god, that's awesome.
[39:56.70]Ah, this is fun.
[39:58.74]You know when you find a game that you just know is fun?
[40:00.89]This one right here.
[40:03.89]Also, I have the area, I gotta remember the right click.
[40:08.46]Hmm.
[40:13.86]I gotta be very proactive about what I do there.
[40:16.43]Wow, you have like a... What is that?
[40:17.69]What are you doing?
[40:20.99]Don't go away, money.
[40:31.13]Don't go away, whatever that is.
[40:33.61]What is that?
[40:34.91]Oh.
[40:37.29]It's a different thing.
[40:38.09]Okay.
[40:39.79]I think I throw these.
[40:42.99]Um... I don't know what's better.
[40:47.85]I mean, that sword was definitely amazing.
[40:52.79]Um... We'll do this.
[40:59.89]That laser gun's cool, but... I mean, I got range already.
[41:03.31]So, with these.
[41:04.27]Let's give it a try.
[41:07.31]Okay, let's go.
[41:14.73]Kunai!
[41:19.36]Well, you know, there was a new weapon in there, but... Wait, where am I going?
[41:27.90]No, right.
[41:30.67]Is there any other place to go in here?
[41:31.71]No.
[41:32.39]Just up there.
[41:35.37]Well, at least I got this.
[41:40.88]Yeah, it's the cuneifers kunai.
[41:42.76]The cuneifers kunai.
[41:46.00]And they're awesome.
[41:50.33]So is this.
[41:50.79]Don't want to waste it.
[41:59.15]Let's try the right click here.
[42:02.36]Okay, it's incredible.
[42:03.88]Got it.
[42:16.43]This game's really fun.
[42:25.32]This is really fun.
[42:28.26]There's one more fucking frog.
[42:29.46]Watch this one.
[42:30.32]If I don't get this, I have to get it in midair.
[42:34.79]If I get it in midair, if I get it in midair, then everybody has to give me a thousand dollars.
[42:37.75]One, two, three.
[42:39.95]Oh, well.
[42:47.92]It's no rat simulator.
[42:48.92]That is true.
[42:50.22]It ain't no rat simulator.
[42:51.52]You do have me on that one.
[42:57.57]That was a sick crit.
[43:06.31]Alright, now he sprints around to get everything.
[43:13.65]Uh, who's left?
[43:16.16]In here?
[43:16.50]Nope.
[43:20.04]Oh, there's one guy right here.
[43:24.39]Whoops.
[43:24.77]Well, I didn't mean to right-click there, but... Whoa!
[43:30.55]Sorry, I got it back.
[43:33.57]Oh, wow.
[43:34.13]The surgeon.
[43:34.97]I know, really.
[43:38.39]I'm, like, living up to my fucking family name.
[43:43.93]What is in here?
[43:45.05]Oh, this is one of those traverse the terrain rooms, and you get some stuff at the end.
[43:49.33]Wow, I like it.
[43:58.15]Scrolls, money, and... Cool guy.
[44:02.38]No friendly fire.
[44:03.38]Is he in co-op?
[44:09.70]It's interesting that's the case, I guess.
[44:15.37]Somebody catch me up?
[44:16.23]Alright, somebody catch this guy up.
[44:17.94]Here we go.
[44:19.48]Um... Rogue-like, kind of... Rogue-like, light RPG.
[44:25.12]F-person shooter.
[44:27.10]With... Money-spending elements.
[44:29.23]There you go.
[44:35.99]Just call me the fucking surgeon!
[44:38.35]For God's sakes!
[44:40.56]The game font changes to hieroglyphics.
[44:44.98]Do I have to take this?
[44:48.42]I actually have to take that.
[44:50.18]I really thought that guy was dead.
[45:02.35]Oh wow, it really is hieroglyphics and I can't even read it.
[45:05.29]I guess you have to take them if you pick them up.
[45:08.87]Some of them can be bad, apparently.
[45:12.12]Like, you weren't even over... Where the hell was this guy?
[45:14.66]What?
[45:17.36]I am confused as all hell.
[45:19.63]There you are.
[45:32.12]The surgeon is my last name.
[45:36.16]Turn on chat interaction.
[45:37.44]I will do that because I'm going to stream this game again.
[45:41.88]And this is a tiny room.
[45:42.84]Alright, we're going to have to go with some surgery here.
[45:49.43]There's two hits on these guys.
[45:51.01]I don't like that.
[45:51.49]We're going to have to go with some pure, just complete surgery.
[45:55.33]Like that.
[45:57.15]How the fuck can I do?
[45:58.37]I can't even get over there.
[46:02.73]How am I supposed to do this?
[46:05.18]Oh.
[46:12.33]How about you do it on this stream?
[46:13.49]Because it requires me to... I think I have to download a bunch of stuff.
[46:17.88]I need to get an authentication code.
[46:19.56]I have to set a bot up, I think somebody was saying.
[46:22.98]So I think it's going to take more than a few minutes to set that up.
[46:26.29]And I don't really have... It's Mother's Day.
[46:28.47]I don't really have that much time today.
[46:31.15]So we'll do that.
[46:34.15]I might just stream this game on Tuesday.
[46:35.45]This game's fucking a blast.
[46:39.96]What am I missing here?
[46:42.87]Like, how do I get up there?
[46:51.83]Can I not, like, get over there?
[46:56.64]Huh?
[46:57.48]What?
[47:02.12]Okay.
[47:03.18]This is, like, confusing me somehow.
[47:08.86]It is just a few minutes?
[47:10.00]Oh, really?
[47:14.76]Well, we'll see.
[47:17.44]And I just took too much damage because I was not paying attention to surgery.
[47:23.99]I don't want to throw this in the lava.
[47:26.23]Double barrel pistol.
[47:32.71]No, I like the kunai.
[47:34.57]I'm keeping the kunai.
[47:45.47]There is no downloading.
[47:46.99]Well, why did somebody tell me I needed a bot?
[47:50.53]I'm gonna go straight back.
[47:58.20]Whoa!
[47:58.78]You just spawned inside of me.
[48:00.22]And I hear frogs.
[48:07.28]They're just gonna rain down on top of me, aren't they?
[48:13.30]Sort of.
[48:13.62]Nah, we're going flamethrower for this one.
[48:26.39]I mean, not really necessary, but fun to do this.
[48:29.11]This room was actually pretty easy, and there's nothing even in here.
[48:41.13]Let me take a look.
[48:42.89]Let's go down that way.
[48:58.05]Don't fall down.
[49:01.93]I love how those guys are one hit with this.
[49:03.31]I hate these things.
[49:04.27]They run too fast.
[49:09.71]Kunai's turning out to be my favorite weapon.
[49:12.39]So far.
[49:14.81]Oh, really?
[49:15.21]A pot blocked that?
[49:16.97]You got blocked by a pot?
[49:19.97]And now we're back wrapped around all the way.
[49:21.77]Let's go up to the top left.
[49:31.57]Uh, yeah.
[49:33.53]Yeah, let's just get out of here.
[49:38.23]Let's get out of here.
[49:44.81]I got pot blocked.
[49:48.75]Where is this?
[49:51.33]Is this down here?
[49:54.15]It is.
[49:55.81]And what's in this room?
[49:57.33]Oh!
[49:57.79]Dangerous things.
[50:00.63]And these guys are dying in the fire.
[50:03.09]Not good.
[50:11.79]Can I at least pick up some of the coins?
[50:16.16]I can't.
[50:16.84]I don't want to risk getting hurt.
[50:19.22]And again, we're at a dead end.
[50:20.18]I guess I have to go down to the bottom right.
[50:29.11]Okay.
[50:34.21]Can I get there from here?
[50:34.93]Yes, I can.
[50:48.02]I think I have low ammo on those.
[50:50.02]Something's popping up on the screen yelling at me.
[50:52.08]Alright, this is the room.
[50:52.78]We're going to go all the way across.
[50:54.06]Let's go.
[50:58.07]Yeah, I didn't do the Twitch features initially because I didn't know if I was going to like the game.
[51:02.43]So I didn't want to set it all up and be like, I don't like this game.
[51:05.17]This game sucks.
[51:06.83]But that's not the case.
[51:19.36]Very good.
[51:22.93]Even more places to go.
[51:24.15]I wish I could see how many of these I had left.
[51:35.19]You are alive still.
[51:37.88]Not for long.
[51:41.34]Nice crit.
[51:42.20]I probably should turn damage numbers on, huh?
[51:45.40]Does that exist?
[51:46.34]I gotta look at that.
[51:50.78]I really wish there was a way I could just, like... What a waste.
[51:58.14]One more, like, shitty dinosaur left.
[51:59.66]Alright.
[52:07.13]Multiple ways to go.
[52:07.95]Let's go up and around.
[52:12.01]Over here.
[52:18.85]Whoa, that's like a snake with a collar on.
[52:25.72]Snake wearing a collar.
[52:28.42]I still haven't utilized, like, this.
[52:31.22]I gotta start doing that more often.
[52:32.42]That move is so good.
[52:33.96]And I just don't use it.
[52:42.79]I'm getting a lot of ammo, though.
[52:43.73]That's a good thing.
[52:46.69]Damn it.
[52:47.25]Of course he's right there.
[52:54.79]This is very elaborate.
[52:55.59]For this being just the first floor, there's a lot of places to go.
[52:58.55]There's a lot of places to go.
[53:07.70]I guess this ain't so simple as just, you know, like, go in like a few rooms and get down to the next floor.
[53:15.20]Is he not dead?
[53:18.81]You're not gonna fool me.
[53:27.15]I thought that was an enemy.
[53:34.99]What are you doing all the way over there?
[53:36.31]You spooky fuck.
[53:45.94]Man, he's dead.
[53:52.14]Okay, this is... This is different.
[53:55.66]I think I found the way out.
[54:01.16]I believe this is the way out.
[54:04.00]Or at least to get to the next floor.
[54:06.38]Holy shit, alright, alright, time to be the fucking surgeon!
[54:10.38]No, no.
[54:18.85]Oh boy.
[54:29.11]Where the hell?
[54:31.65]What is it?
[54:33.31]Oh, god damn it.
[54:33.85]I don't know what this does.
[54:34.63]I can't read.
[54:35.19]I don't know what that does.
[54:38.82]I can't read it.
[54:47.18]Alright, let's... What do you think?
[54:50.14]Should I explore more or should I just move on to the next floor?
[54:55.76]I think I just want to go to the next floor.
[54:58.46]This might be the secrets and shit, but let's move on.
[55:03.42]Let's check it out.
[55:09.43]Cool.
[55:11.11]Jerma, I... Oh, God.
[55:12.67]I don't even know what this... What does this even mean?
[55:14.61]What does this say?
[55:19.34]I don't know.
[55:20.90]Wow, that sucks.
[55:23.00]Somebody Google Translate what that just tried to tell me.
[55:25.26]I don't even know how much money I have.
[55:39.55]Get, like, locked in that hallway.
[55:46.42]Holy shit!
[55:47.64]Why did I not save that for right here?
[55:49.32]There's a big pulse bomb.
[55:57.65]Think I'm running low on ammo on this thing.
[56:01.51]I think.
[56:06.85]What is this?
[56:08.89]Oh.
[56:09.81]That's what they're coming from.
[56:10.73]These stupid lemmings.
[56:14.20]Really.
[56:14.54]And I got hit by it.
[56:15.58]I'm just so sick of their dumb little lemming shit.
[56:21.92]Let's go down.
[56:28.51]Whatever.
[56:28.77]You guys can walk around like aimless idiots.
[56:30.45]That's fine.
[56:30.93]And that's what they're here for.
[56:33.11]They're here to be a distraction.
[56:39.14]Whoa, boy.
[56:50.92]Lots of stuff that I didn't pick up.
[57:00.36]Why did that guy drop so much stuff?
[57:02.30]That was like a little shitty guy.
[57:09.98]Oh, damn it.
[57:11.45]Damn it.
[57:11.99]Oh, well.
[57:12.91]There's one more of those little hives somewhere lying around.
[57:16.63]Oh, maybe not.
[57:19.03]And this room was useless.
[57:20.23]Great.
[57:27.90]Let's go to the right.
[57:30.14]I'm going to start using this.
[57:30.98]There's so much ammo in this gun, I believe, that I'm just holding on to it for no reason.
[57:42.96]It does, like, obstruct the screen a little, though, I will say.
[57:46.42]This thing kind of sucks.
[57:55.15]Not a big fan of this one, if I will say, guys.
[58:01.47]Really.
[58:02.45]What a dummy.
[58:08.29]I feel like it's not accurate to where the flames actually go.
[58:13.08]It doesn't seem to hit anything.
[58:17.74]Chest, uh-huh.
[58:23.56]And then up.
[58:31.90]What's in the chest?
[58:35.27]A new gun.
[58:38.30]Rocket launcher.
[58:39.40]Yes.
[58:39.85]I'm going to replace this.
[58:42.79]This is awesome.
[58:48.54]Just got here.
[58:48.96]Why can't I read?
[58:49.66]I picked up an item that makes it so I can only see things as hieroglyphics.
[58:55.99]So that's the unfortunate thing.
[58:57.91]Every single piece of text is now hieroglyphics.
[59:00.49]I have no idea where I am.
[59:03.03]Look, the game can hear me.
[59:05.00]It has microphone interaction settings.
[59:08.00]I heard me talk about how I didn't like that gun, and so I replaced it.
[59:13.90]And a crowbar, but I don't want the crowbar.
[59:16.76]I like these two items.
[59:17.70]I already have a melee weapon, and it's great.
[59:22.82]Let's go down from here.
[59:34.80]And lots of projectiles coming my way here.
[60:03.24]Kunai is... Kunai best weapon.
[60:08.02]Like, I can be certain of that.
[60:10.12]Actually, rocket launcher best weapon.
[60:14.43]The rocket launcher is so good.
[60:20.09]Long reload, though.
[60:21.49]Very long reload.
[60:28.91]That's a pretty long, that's a pretty wrong lilo, dude.
[60:31.29]Alright, I'm done with that one.
[60:38.55]Fuck, there's like nothing substantial over here at all.
[60:45.94]Dude, what is with these like little indie games that I played this year that are like the games that I fucking have had the most fun of the whole year?
[60:53.10]Big, huge releases have come out that I've played that have just sucked.
[60:57.83]This is... I really like this.
[61:00.66]This is actually very, very fun for me right now.
[61:10.32]Um... I'm gonna go all the way up.
[61:14.92]Like, think of the releases that came out so far this year.
[61:17.24]There were some huge ones.
[61:19.08]And they weren't even that good.
[61:24.99]Air shot.
[61:28.55]Got that air shot though.
[61:30.39]Got that air shot though.
[61:32.65]Even though it was pretty much like... Look at that fucking aerial shot.
[61:45.88]Start over with Twitch voting.
[61:47.12]I promise I will do Twitch voting.
[61:49.84]I'm kind of like in a groove right now.
[61:52.47]But I'm gonna stream this game on Tuesday.
[61:56.65]Without a doubt.
[61:57.11]This is the game we're playing on Tuesday.
[61:59.17]And we'll do full-on Twitch integration.
[62:03.83]For sure.
[62:08.61]I am gonna play this on Tuesday.
[62:11.21]With the complete integration.
[62:17.32]God, that was an awful place for me to start.
[62:24.42]Holy shit.
[62:25.42]Holy shit.
[62:26.22]Holy shit.
[62:26.70]Holy shit.
[62:27.22]Slow down.
[62:28.14]Slow down here.
[62:31.94]Damn it.
[62:32.20]I missed.
[62:32.52]They're supposed to call me the surgery bastard.
[62:38.00]I didn't hit him.
[62:38.60]Come on.
[62:38.96]They're supposed to call me the surgery bastard.
[62:48.76]What's this last... This last guy dropping bombs.
[62:56.55]Oh, the whole thing with West... So let me explain what happened to Western Week.
[62:59.61]For those of you that are like, what the hell happened?
[63:03.43]So all the games that I bought for Western Week, there was like three or four really good ones I was really looking forward to.
[63:12.71]None of them worked.
[63:15.09]None of them.
[63:18.13]And I had to...
[63:20.35]Like, install a virtual fucking machine.
[63:22.75]And trying to get that to work was a pain in the ass.
[63:24.97]And that barely worked.
[63:26.91]And... Hold on.
[63:27.99]I thought he was dead.
[63:31.11]I really thought he was dead.
[63:33.09]I don't know what it means.
[63:36.11]So none of the Western games worked.
[63:37.82]Alright, hold on.
[63:40.12]Give me these.
[63:47.68]But I'm gonna try to get them to work.
[63:55.12]You will see those Western games.
[63:57.41]I bought them.
[63:58.89]You know?
[63:59.13]It would be such a waste of money.
[64:01.27]I spent a lot of money.
[64:04.41]Not on my watch right now, buddy.
[64:07.05]Maybe on my watch.
[64:12.54]That was close.
[64:16.42]Jesus.
[64:21.16]What?
[64:22.64]What?
[64:23.54]What?
[64:24.46]Come on.
[64:25.64]Really?
[64:28.68]Jeremiah wasting money?
[64:29.72]Nah.
[64:32.22]You're gonna get redneck weak?
[64:33.57]No, you're gonna get like... You're gonna get redneck... Hold on, everybody.
[64:37.85]Hold on.
[64:38.15]Let me reload this.
[64:48.56]That was what you call a quadruple.
[64:51.97]Even though it wasn't a quadruple.
[64:53.13]I'm gonna pretend it was a quadruple.
[65:02.49]Not dead?
[65:03.43]Oh, shit.
[65:05.37]Die!
[65:11.80]Ooh, baby, a quadruple.
[65:17.14]These things just annoy me.
[65:18.32]I hate these things.
[65:22.66]But they serve their purpose of being useless.
[65:37.54]Going up the stairs.
[65:38.38]Yep, yep, yep.
[65:40.02]Okay.
[65:43.24]I guess I'm right behind me, I guess.
[65:47.46]I've never played Rust.
[65:48.91]I have played Rust.
[65:51.44]And here's the exit, by the way.
[65:52.68]Let's be careful, though.
[65:57.96]Holy shit.
[65:59.54]Okay, I don't want to, like, activate the frog stream just yet, you know?
[66:04.62]Like, now I do.
[66:05.40]Ow.
[66:07.86]Come around, make sure I don't miss any coins.
[66:18.29]I probably have a lot of money.
[66:19.55]I've been alive for a while.
[66:26.72]Am I from Boston?
[66:29.57]Yes, I am from that area of the world, of the country.
[66:39.24]There's probably a lot more to explore, but I have to die here.
[66:42.14]I'm just going up.
[66:50.51]I wish I knew what that meant.
[66:54.76]So those two cards there at the bottom, what the hell does that mean?
[66:58.70]I have not been able to see those without hieroglyphics.
[67:03.48]I've only seen those with hieroglyphics.
[67:05.27]I've not been able to do it any other way.
[67:13.07]Oh boy.
[67:14.53]Let's go over here.
[67:19.20]And who else?
[67:19.60]Who else?
[67:19.90]Who else?
[67:20.18]Who else?
[67:20.72]Scary magicians.
[67:30.14]Hey, come on, that family feud shit was... That was ridiculous.
[67:35.47]At least one of those should have been correct.
[67:38.69]At least.
[67:42.03]Dammit.
[67:42.31]You know what I'm saying?
[67:47.90]Like, one of those had to have been right.
[67:52.76]And that just was not the case.
[67:55.48]At all.
[68:03.85]Oh.
[68:03.95]I was going to say, where the hell is this last person?
[68:11.57]I went underneath him.
[68:14.11]Bullshit.
[68:15.05]Okay.
[68:15.73]Is everything reloaded?
[68:17.46]Yeah.
[68:20.78]How about I play a normal game, like Family Feud?
[68:25.64]Oh!
[68:32.97]Really?
[68:33.99]No, I don't believe it.
[68:36.49]I don't believe it.
[68:38.41]What is hurting me?
[68:39.79]All the spikes are coming up from these grates.
[68:44.20]Wow, and I'm like dead.
[68:45.36]I didn't even know that was happening.
[68:52.40]Come on.
[68:54.17]That is so horrible.
[68:55.63]Well, this is where I die.
[69:05.99]Maybe not yet, but it's gonna be close, because here come all the fucking snake callers.
[69:15.77]Is there one more?
[69:17.29]One fat guy.
[69:20.59]No, he dead.
[69:22.61]One more.
[69:23.71]What's left?
[69:26.11]One more random snake that ran up the stairs, and it's gonna turn and hit me, and I'm gonna die.
[69:32.71]I knew it.
[69:33.17]I, like, knew that was gonna happen.
[69:37.32]I ended up just being spawned up here for no reason.
[69:40.24]Now I'm in deep trouble.
[69:43.08]Wonderful.
[69:46.96]Nothing else in here.
[69:51.31]Game sucks.
[69:52.11]No, this game does not suck.
[69:58.31]Don't... I'm so paranoid about this.
[70:03.68]I am going to die in here, though.
[70:10.53]I'm in trouble.
[70:12.63]I'm in trouble.
[70:13.35]Come on, give me that fresh meat.
[70:16.50]Two fresh meats.
[70:25.04]Meat, come on.
[70:30.34]Too much bullet hell.
[70:36.61]Right in the head.
[70:41.84]More people?
[70:44.96]One more dinosaur?
[70:46.52]Somewhere?
[70:50.20]Part of me wants to die so I can get this hieroglyphic shit off my screen so I can know what items I'm picking up.
[70:56.63]That wouldn't be that terrible to me if I actually did die.
[71:02.19]I almost just died right there by walking into that.
[71:06.77]Okay.
[71:07.75]Over here.
[71:08.51]Right here.
[71:09.97]This is reloaded.
[71:11.11]Reload this before I walk in here.
[71:12.39]Have I ever played Don't Starve?
[71:16.62]Yes.
[71:20.88]I'm not really a fan of Don't Starve.
[71:24.66]And I just missed.
[71:25.58]I'm dead.
[71:26.70]Okay.
[71:27.36]Well, it had to happen at some point.
[71:28.52]It had to happen at some point.
[71:34.32]Hopefully I can... I like Seth.
[71:37.58]Seth is fun.
[71:43.50]Let me see this.
[71:48.53]3,000 gold.
[71:50.13]Let's buy the shop.
[71:52.13]Because obviously that's like... The merch of the shop is open.
[71:54.90]That's a big chunk that I don't need to do anymore.
[71:56.72]Let's see what that does.
[72:02.15]I thought this guy was just talking.
[72:09.62]Grants you a scroll as you enter the pyramid.
[72:12.30]Grants you a good scroll as you enter the pyramid.
[72:15.84]The pyramid will be the same as the last time you visited, but all the gold will be gone.
[72:21.24]Okay, so you can stop it from being procedurally generated.
[72:23.48]I mean, I guess these are... Okay.
[72:30.45]I think that guy just called me a really bad word.
[72:34.87]Alright, what's been causing problems to me, right?
[72:45.88]Is it health?
[72:46.38]I think I'm running into a health issue.
[72:52.58]I'm going to do health and defense.
[72:59.85]What is this?
[73:00.89]More health recovered from steak.
[73:02.18]This is a new person.
[73:03.18]This is... We're going to have to get... Yeah.
[73:12.22]168.
[73:12.24]Let's see.
[73:15.21]We'll do that too.
[73:16.19]Crit upgrade.
[73:17.05]Jesus, there's so much shit here.
[73:24.29]Get this guy.
[73:24.81]I will after this.
[73:31.64]So, now I've got more health, more defense.
[73:34.24]I feel like I'm taking my hits that I'm taking.
[73:36.32]I'm really starting to kill me.
[73:37.58]It'd be bad.
[73:38.36]I don't think I have any more money anyways, so... Ah, fuck.
[73:46.77]I should have done that.
[73:49.79]Alright.
[73:53.09]Time's at 10 o'clock.
[73:54.74]So, I have...
[73:56.74]We're going to do... I don't have very much time today.
[74:01.89]Because obviously it's Mother's Day and I'm... Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.
[74:06.95]We'll do that on Tuesday.
[74:08.81]We're going to do that on Tuesday.
[74:09.93]I'm going to play this on Tuesday.
[74:12.13]Because I just want to do another few runs.
[74:14.47]I wanted to make sure I got a stream in here because I didn't stream on Tuesday.
[74:19.02]We will do the full Twitch interaction thing.
[74:21.78]I just want to keep playing.
[74:25.84]I'm spending eight gold.
[74:27.10]Twitch Tuesday.
[74:35.74]The tree evolves.
[74:36.38]Yeah, it's kind of like Rogue Legacy.
[74:39.98]That reminds me of Rogue.
[74:40.72]So now I'm going to be able just to sprint through.
[74:42.64]I mean, I guess that's the theory, right?
[74:53.49]And there's the first scroll.
[74:54.25]Dracula, you recover health every time you kill an enemy, but meat no longer gives you health.
[74:58.25]Oh, great.
[75:03.69]But this does have a very Doom feel to it, though.
[75:07.60]It does.
[75:10.50]Let me go over here.
[75:16.28]I already took a hit.
[75:22.00]Do I start on floor 1 again, right?
[75:24.53]I think that's how it works.
[75:25.45]I don't like these guys.
[75:36.73]I'm playing like I have the kunai still, and I do not.
[76:00.51]Must left.
[76:01.37]Reload.
[76:10.36]I feel like the enemies level up as you do, I think.
[76:13.06]I'm gonna assume, because these guys are taking a lot of hits.
[76:16.56]But that flamethrower is a piece of crap.
[76:18.82]It is not good.
[76:21.66]I'm definitely going to unlock the next person.
[76:23.92]I'm going to unlock one of the other guys, because as cool as these weapons are... I think the flair of having these weapons initially has worn off.
[76:34.76]The sword is really good, though.
[76:36.78]If there's one thing I'm sad I'm not going to be able to keep, it's the sword, for sure.
[76:43.34]For sure.
[76:44.14]And, like, where... Okay, where are these fucking Draculas?
[76:51.31]So I can't get meat anymore.
[76:53.07]So this is going to be a very quick run.
[76:55.16]I'm going to die.
[77:02.26]Holy shit, that guy dropped a lot of stuff.
[77:08.77]How the fuck do I get over there?
[77:11.59]What is going on right now?
[77:13.99]Where am I?
[77:14.83]This is a random chest down here.
[77:20.04]Chosen one medallion.
[77:21.18]You found a blueprint.
[77:22.34]Check it outside at the merchant in your next run.
[77:25.86]Cool.
[77:29.64]Is this a standard pistol?
[77:31.34]No, this thing sucks.
[77:32.52]Actually, no, it doesn't.
[77:34.29]Oh, it kind of does, though.
[77:35.49]Alright, now get me out of this.
[77:47.39]Where's the exit?
[77:49.01]Oh, there it is.
[77:50.53]Well, I got a blueprint.
[77:55.83]Whatever that means, I'm sure we'll find out.
[78:04.60]Whatever that means.
[78:05.82]Reload.
[78:09.38]It's a good time for Jupiters.
[78:10.54]I mean... Could be.
[78:17.42]How much health do I get for killing somebody?
[78:23.84]126 health for killing somebody, and I can't get meat.
[78:27.68]Actually, not that bad.
[78:29.68]I'm not un-okay with that.
[78:33.54]I'm not un-okay with that.
[78:43.63]Keep it rolling.
[78:45.91]Reload.
[78:46.39]Holy shit.
[78:52.56]Reach the chest.
[78:55.72]Uh... I think I found the place where I die.
[79:03.69]Where?
[79:03.95]Oh, there's a ledge.
[79:04.53]I gotta grab one of the ledges.
[79:06.71]Go up, go up, go up!
[79:15.71]Reach the chest.
[79:16.69]Okay, well...
[79:30.09]Okay.
[79:38.54]Where's the chest?
[79:46.46]Hello?
[79:47.20]What?
[79:47.64]Am I missing something here?
[79:59.06]What the fuck?
[80:03.87]Why did all that exist up there?
[80:05.53]What the f- Why?
[80:07.85]Weapon accuracy, but- but- Blunderbuss.
[80:11.79]Ooh, I got- Okay, I know.
[80:12.95]I'm gonna do this.
[80:14.93]I'll keep this.
[80:21.02]I mean, like, reach the chest.
[80:22.30]It's like, alright, reach the chest.
[80:23.56]And then all of a sudden, there's all these things with all these- Whatever.
[80:26.76]Whatever.
[80:30.24]Whatever.
[80:30.72]Well, I can't... There's nothing else here, so... I want to have the flamethrower.
[80:47.23]I don't know if I'm still my... The book is out for me on the flamethrower.
[80:53.20]I kind of want to keep it, just because it's... It sucks, but... I kind of want it.
[81:04.14]Getting texted.
[81:07.66]This is good.
[81:09.44]This weapon is really good.
[81:10.60]What is this?
[81:12.02]No friendly fire.
[81:12.82]I still don't know what that means.
[81:13.96]Can I just not hurt myself with explosions?
[81:16.49]I guess.
[81:21.93]Actually, I don't really have any long range.
[81:23.91]This is my range.
[81:28.75]Plenty of ammo, though.
[81:29.53]Good, good, good.
[81:37.19]that don't reach.
[81:42.88]Grandpa's blunderbuss sure does go a very long way.
[81:46.12]It's not really a blunderbuss, is it?
[81:48.68]It's a very high precision rifle.
[81:50.43]This thing is awesome.
[82:05.74]My phone is going crazy.
[82:08.12]I think this is some Mother's Day stuff.
[82:18.09]I believe this is a Mother's Day family text.
[82:24.80]Yeah, and watch out for the hazardous guacamole.
[82:31.39]One really good thing about this game that I can say is, you know, thumbs up.
[82:35.89]The movement is very, very, very good.
[82:40.91]It flows very well.
[82:44.77]I've not had any, like, issue at all with the controls.
[82:47.47]And, you know, it's cool because you can move faster in midair if you hold shift.
[82:51.87]So shift is not so much a sprint as it is just, like, just go faster.
[82:56.03]So you can do, like, go a little bit faster that way.
[82:59.35]That's cool.
[83:02.81]Stop streaming and go see your mother.
[83:04.39]I don't know why I'm picking those up.
[83:07.64]They don't even do anything to me anymore.
[83:16.54]Grandpa!
[83:21.86]Yes, I'm going to see my mother very shortly.
[83:24.38]Don't worry, guys.
[83:30.94]Don't worry.
[83:31.56]Wow.
[83:34.52]That's a pretty good Christopher Walken impression right there.
[83:45.83]Livestream hanging out with my mother.
[83:48.83]No, my mother would not want to be on camera.
[83:52.79]She'd be like, why are you filming me right now?
[83:56.78]It's for the internet, ma.
[84:03.89]Watch me look at my phone and all of a sudden it's just like, I want to be on camera!
[84:16.69]Yeah, on second thought, this thing does suck.
[84:20.51]This thing actually sucks real bad.
[84:24.36]To the point where I'm not even going to equip it again.
[84:30.33]I ain't even gonna equip that again.
[84:33.01]You know what I'm saying?
[84:37.12]Mom stream or Riot?
[84:38.52]No.
[84:43.28]Oh, there we go.
[84:43.64]Enemies plus 10.
[84:44.38]There we go.
[84:47.54]That is what I was trying to figure out what the hell that meant.
[84:51.50]And now I know what it means.
[84:54.23]Let's go.
[84:54.93]So every floor they get stronger and there's more drops for you.
[84:58.49]Cool.
[84:58.87]And more money.
[84:59.57]Cool.
[85:01.11]Something tells me that gets upgraded.
[85:02.58]I'm sure I can do something about that.
[85:04.40]Eventually.
[85:07.42]Alright.
[85:08.36]Let's go up.
[85:15.39]That one's hard to get to.
[85:22.45]I like this area though.
[85:28.70]Money.
[85:34.37]No, why am I equipping that?
[85:35.25]I said I was never going to equip that again.
[85:36.43]I need to listen to myself.
[85:39.45]I need to listen to my heart when I say these things.
[85:43.65]Ow.
[85:44.31]Oh, no.
[85:45.75]Oh, no.
[85:49.15]That guy dead?
[85:49.73]He is.
[85:50.01]But that money, thank goodness I could somehow grab onto that ledge.
[86:03.66]Give me that.
[86:04.32]Cash.
[86:06.39]Fuck is right.
[86:07.41]I took so much damage.
[86:09.33]Unnecessary.
[86:10.07]Wow, that's something new.
[86:11.13]What is that?
[86:11.55]It's a machine gun.
[86:13.87]An assault rifle.
[86:16.85]Nice.
[86:17.45]This is way better than that thing.
[86:23.10]Oh, this thing is crazy.
[86:25.18]It doesn't fit with this game, but it does.
[86:27.78]Doesn't it?
[86:35.14]This thing sucks.
[86:36.36]Never mind.
[86:37.50]Never mind.
[86:37.87]This thing's not good.
[86:43.89]Oh, shit in my pants.
[86:46.11]Get up there.
[86:46.47]Come on.
[86:59.62]Maybe I need to stop, like, burst firing it, maybe, and get a little closer.
[87:07.73]I don't know.
[87:08.21]This thing might actually be worse than the flamethrower.
[87:10.81]But it does shoot farther.
[87:13.21]So, it's all good.
[87:15.79]Keep it rolling.
[87:25.97]I'm going to use it for another few seconds before I determine if I don't ever want to use it again.
[87:35.20]Mmm!
[87:36.78]It does have a lot of ammo.
[87:38.70]I will give it that.
[87:39.26]It is very, very fruitful with the ammo.
[87:47.63]One of these dumb frogs.
[87:48.59]Ah, thank god there's no stupid frog lagoon anywhere.
[87:56.53]Yeah, it does stunlock.
[87:57.49]That is a good thing.
[88:08.54]Let's get up there.
[88:12.06]Whoa, there wasn't any ammo left.
[88:14.34]Wow.
[88:19.77]Wow, you were right behind him.
[88:23.99]This room sucks.
[88:24.79]Where the hell did that guy come from?
[88:36.95]I'm running away, running away.
[88:38.95]Hard for me to say words sometimes.
[88:42.39]Because I'm a moron.
[88:50.27]Very long range.
[88:51.17]That is great.
[88:52.28]30 more shots.
[89:01.10]Okay.
[89:08.25]That was a bullshit spawn.
[89:10.68]You know, I'm gonna come out and say it.
[89:11.68]It's okay though.
[89:31.76]Sarcophagus guy underneath.
[89:33.20]Stun lock him so he doesn't spawn things too late.
[89:35.44]It's okay though, whatever.
[89:40.82]Alright.
[89:41.42]I've done everything over here except for that way.
[89:44.68]Let's try that way.
[89:49.38]Let's try over on the right side.
[89:50.92]Maybe we'll find some more enemy monsters.
[89:53.14]I don't remember ancient Egypt having all these guns.
[90:03.31]You are correct.
[90:07.35]That guy's going to die right now.
[90:14.73]Really?
[90:14.93]I thought I jumped that.
[90:30.86]Ow.
[90:38.08]We're going to go for a jump here.
[90:40.00]I don't want to just... I'd rather just hit them like... Nothing over here.
[90:49.77]Shit.
[90:52.73]I got really screwed over here.
[90:55.05]Let's go left.
[90:58.51]Immortal Redneck is the game.
[90:59.81]Immortal Redneck, if you're curious.
[91:02.73]If you're like, what game is he playing?
[91:05.79]It's Immortal Redneck.
[91:14.33]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[91:15.77]This is not hard.
[91:19.20]And, like, I'm gonna fuck it up every time, guys.
[91:20.88]Actually, this is not even really that easy.
[91:28.19]It's very easy.
[91:30.31]It's extraordinarily easy, and I screwed it up.
[91:32.31]Nothing.
[91:49.82]I guess... How the hell am I going to make it up there?
[91:59.32]Yeah, for those of us that are going to be disappearing for Mother's Day, we're going to be going to see mothers.
[92:06.01]Happy Mother's Day.
[92:06.83]I'm going to be leaving very shortly here.
[92:09.35]But I did want to make sure I got a stream in.
[92:12.51]But yes, happy Mother's Day nonetheless.
[92:16.76]To all you moms.
[92:23.36]I just realized they're hanging on these poles.
[92:25.08]There's a gun over here.
[92:32.54]Didn't even see you, buddy.
[92:34.08]What is that?
[92:34.72]Another machine gun?
[92:36.90]Crossbow machine gun.
[92:40.18]Okay, well, we're going to try... Forget about that thing.
[92:45.13]We're going to use this.
[92:46.86]A crossbow machine gun.
[92:49.84]That works.
[92:50.28]I wonder how much damage it does.
[92:59.46]It's pretty awesome actually.
[93:02.71]It's really awesome.
[93:03.45]What's the reload time?
[93:05.81]Extremely long.
[93:08.35]But it's good.
[93:10.07]It's actually very good.
[93:16.88]Thank God I was right up that guy's ass.
[93:19.08]Man, Egypt sure was advanced.
[93:35.53]Remember when Egypt had all these fucking rapid-fire machine gun bombs?
[93:43.59]Where you off to?
[93:44.82]Where you off to?
[93:52.44]Another empty room.
[93:54.52]Great.
[93:58.26]I should be making a lava joke right now.
[93:59.74]I don't know if I have any lava joke material.
[94:03.73]I'm sorry guys.
[94:07.01]I don't have any material for this.
[94:11.77]And another empty room.
[94:19.89]It's not that long of a range there.
[94:30.32]Oh, this sucks.
[94:30.88]There's nothing even up here.
[94:31.74]I'm just going all the way up here.
[94:36.57]I wish there was at least a chest or something up here.
[94:38.35]This is awful.
[94:40.93]All the way to the top for nothing.
[94:44.15]That's just teleporting idiots.
[94:51.69]Come on Okay, well there's another dud There we go we found it let's get these guys with a right-click And kill you
[95:22.66]Wow, how did I not take any damage there?
[95:24.82]I have no idea.
[95:25.92]I will never know.
[95:29.87]Now I did.
[95:31.05]Not only did I take damage once, I took damage like twice.
[95:33.75]Alright, to the next area.
[95:45.96]Wait, what happened?
[95:46.88]What did I do?
[95:51.07]Wait, what happened?
[95:51.97]What did I say that was stupid?
[95:54.16]What happened?
[95:58.78]Alright, they have 40% more damage.
[96:05.24]Saving ammo as he misses five shots.
[96:06.94]Well, that's typical.
[96:11.48]Stupid.
[96:12.04]What did I do?
[96:12.90]Stupid?
[96:13.24]I did something stupid?
[96:21.34]Oh, well, I'm full of stupid ideas.
[96:25.80]It's hard for me to talk.
[96:27.16]Don't worry.
[96:36.49]This thing is amazing.
[96:37.29]How much money do I have?
[96:49.59]How much is the Seth upgrade?
[96:51.17]2,500?
[96:51.25]Get out of here, you fucking asshole.
[96:57.53]Silly streamer disappoints on Mother's Day.
[96:59.87]What?
[97:04.68]Speaking of dying, it's gonna happen.
[97:10.76]It's these guys.
[97:12.12]These guys are priority.
[97:14.00]What did I just do?
[97:15.42]What?
[97:17.59]I was so confused right there, honest to God.
[97:19.63]I thought that was some type of weird, like, blow the flute in Mario 3.
[97:24.45]I don't even know what the hell this does.
[97:28.31]It has no ammo.
[97:31.86]Okay.
[97:35.50]I'm gonna use it to replace this, because I'm not using the sword really at alright now.
[97:43.42]There's still a frog somewhere.
[97:44.68]Let's try this.
[97:48.41]I'm gonna, again, the stairs.
[97:59.26]Ah.
[98:00.40]For not costing any ammo to use this, it's actually pretty good.
[98:05.16]It's not bad.
[98:05.68]Get the high ground.
[98:15.34]Shit.
[98:20.04]Really?
[98:21.54]Wait, you didn't die.
[98:22.38]That's what the problem was.
[98:25.82]I thought he was dead.
[98:28.02]Apparently he needed another hit.
[98:33.17]So many bugs down there.
[98:34.69]They're not bugs.
[98:37.37]Well.
[98:40.51]I will gladly stay up here.
[98:42.23]Because if I go down there, you know what?
[98:47.04]No, I have to go down there.
[98:55.64]That shit would have taken all day.
[98:58.08]It's okay, I'll take one hit.
[99:03.25]Frog equals bug.
[99:06.49]I know, I'm stupid.
[99:10.95]Stupid.
[99:18.13]Whoops, right clicked accidentally there.
[99:25.50]Oh shit.
[99:39.47]He's dead?
[99:39.91]Did I get it?
[99:40.33]I think so.
[99:42.09]I'm gonna miss that, those coins up there, but if I got hit, I'm gonna die if I get hit.
[99:54.25]Well, apparently didn't make that jump.
[100:04.30]Nope, I didn't.
[100:06.42]It's okay.
[100:11.20]This way.
[100:13.44]Where do you spend the gold?
[100:14.10]You spend the gold when you die.
[100:17.96]You spend the gold on death.
[100:22.62]There's a shop.
[100:23.74]And there's a big skill tree that you spend all your gold on.
[100:32.96]Oh my god, look at all that down there.
[100:36.13]Oh my god, how am I supposed to do this?
[100:44.79]I guess like that, apparently.
[100:46.43]I wish I had grenades right now.
[100:50.97]I'm not gonna be able to get much.
[100:52.31]I have to just reload this and spam this down the hallway.
[100:54.99]There's so many things down here.
[101:10.02]Wow!
[101:13.98]Oh, God.
[101:15.62]Oh, this is it.
[101:16.20]This is gonna be it.
[101:18.96]Maybe not.
[101:19.38]Not quite.
[101:20.32]It's going to be close.
[101:36.93]Where are the votes for the scrolls?
[101:38.23]I haven't turned it on.
[101:41.22]I'm just too sucked in right now and I have to leave in 15 minutes or so.
[101:45.48]This is probably going to be the last run.
[101:47.82]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[101:52.27]Cursed favor increases your attack, but you can only carry one weapon.
[101:55.39]Oh, man.
[102:00.23]That's no good.
[102:04.07]That's really no good.
[102:09.39]Which one of these weapons?
[102:10.31]Should I just... The Ankh?
[102:14.56]I knew a girl had one of those tattoos down by her.
[102:18.06]It's got to be the Ankh, unfortunately.
[102:25.40]This is the safest bet, because it's long range, it's short range, and it, you know... Or I could take the Rod... No, all these... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[102:33.33]We're going to do Ankh Master.
[102:37.15]We'll go with Ankh Master until I die.
[102:38.74]And then that's probably going to be the end of today's stream.
[102:44.20]Quick little Sunday Mother's Day stream.
[102:50.70]Okay, the Ankh was a fucking mistake.
[103:02.15]Oh well.
[103:07.84]This game is really fun.
[103:10.88]So let's do some leveling up.
[103:12.68]The tree grows as you level it up too.
[103:14.44]That's really interesting.
[103:17.74]Let's get... Rusty Revolver Uzi Gatling Gun Grenade Launcher.
[103:26.78]This guy starts with the Ankh.
[103:30.62]Let's unlock this guy.
[103:33.58]For next time.
[103:37.52]Crit damage.
[103:38.34]This is Amulet.
[103:43.29]I could upgrade Seth.
[103:44.69]Let's do some straight up damage upgrades right now.
[103:50.79]Let's get this to 10.
[103:59.60]One more into crit.
[104:03.34]Two into health.
[104:03.94]Can I do anything else?
[104:07.92]I don't think so.
[104:11.56]I can buy a scroll though.
[104:18.41]Let me just buy a scroll.
[104:24.46]I can't even buy a scroll.
[104:26.24]I just want to try the new guy.
[104:28.00]He's going to go and die.
[104:29.08]I want to try the new character.
[104:32.00]I can't buy anything anyways.
[104:36.31]Do I play Ziggurat?
[104:39.51]I have tried Ziggurat.
[104:41.43]Very long time ago though.
[104:42.95]That was an extremely long time ago.
[104:48.45]I need to die here.
[104:50.67]Oh, I get the blueprint too.
[104:51.67]That's shit.
[104:52.17]I didn't realize that.
[104:54.67]Let's try the other character.
[104:58.91]Oh, wait.
[104:59.17]These guys are going to die because I have... Wait.
[105:02.17]I can't hurt myself.
[105:08.93]I'll check the medallion in the shop and see how much that is.
[105:11.21]Watch it be like $140.
[105:11.75]I'd be so angry.
[105:12.21]Let's try him.
[105:20.58]Let's see.
[105:21.20]There he is.
[105:21.58]I love how it's Apis.
[105:26.80]Apis.
[105:27.20]Seth.
[105:28.02]Redneck.
[105:29.46]Remember that Egyptian god, Redneck?
[105:33.65]Let's see.
[105:41.33]This is a rusty revolver.
[105:42.75]A lot of kickback.
[105:45.41]Probably does a lot of damage.
[105:47.07]Got a lot of items.
[105:47.98]Uzi.
[105:48.22]Uzi.
[105:50.73]Dude, this guy's more redneck than actual redneck.
[105:55.99]My lord.
[105:59.23]And a grenade launcher.
[106:03.55]And his, what is this?
[106:04.51]He's invincible?
[106:05.73]You don't take any damage?
[106:06.51]That's really good.
[106:07.31]Alright, let's take a look.
[106:12.94]Medallions.
[106:14.46]Increases attack and defense.
[106:17.63]So, I guess I can just buy this at the beginning and have it permanently for the run.
[106:24.85]Alright, let's go give this a try.
[106:27.07]And then that's going to be it.
[106:29.79]I'm wasting ammo to show off.
[106:32.83]Jerma, stop being such a fucking show-off.
[106:41.74]Let's just give it a test.
[106:43.14]He's got a lot of health.
[106:47.32]I feel like this is not going to be that accurate, though.
[106:57.49]Really cool animation, but gun kind of sucks.
[107:05.45]How accurate is it?
[107:09.78]Hmm.
[107:12.18]Fairly inaccurate.
[107:13.64]Did that just headshot, though?
[107:16.54]It might have.
[107:22.26]Let's try shooting this guy in the leg and see what happens.
[107:24.05]Nah, I guess it just kills.
[107:25.95]Alright, what about the Uzi?
[107:34.15]Uzi?
[107:34.37]I feel like I should be using this.
[107:43.09]Okay, well the Gatling gun is kind of insane.
[107:47.46]Alright, you play this character for the gatling gun.
[107:50.20]You just sprint around and just keep it rolling.
[107:55.12]And it stunlocks.
[107:57.58]Okay.
[107:58.98]Well... Just keep it spinning.
[108:07.34]This is fucking awesome.
[108:19.05]And we got our item room.
[108:20.27]Nice.
[108:20.53]A new medallion.
[108:24.25]You found the new blueprint.
[108:25.10]Check it out.
[108:25.64]Nice.
[108:32.04]Mr. Wayne, increase the fire rate of your weapons.
[108:34.68]Oh, lord.
[108:36.58]Alright, well, I might want to... Oh, this thing's... I don't want that.
[108:42.77]This thing's horrible.
[108:44.47]I'd rather have the dumb revolver.
[108:53.91]Didn't really get a chance to see the Uzi, though.
[108:55.85]Let's see.
[108:59.92]There's another chest.
[109:03.12]Reach the chest.
[109:07.74]Ah.
[109:09.92]Reach the chest.
[109:17.00]Something tells me I don't have, like, the necessary, like, upgrades to do this.
[109:24.19]Damn it.
[109:24.61]Okay, um... Shit.
[109:39.99]Okay, that's not gonna work.
[109:43.42]Uh...
[109:49.80]Nope.
[109:50.90]Nope.
[109:51.10]Nope.
[109:51.26]Nope.
[109:52.82]Nope.
[109:56.00]God damn it.
[109:57.32]I don't think I can get that.
[109:58.70]I don't think I have the necessary upgrades.
[110:00.66]I can't jump fast enough.
[110:08.72]Oh well.
[110:08.96]Let's go this way.
[110:15.18]Wait.
[110:15.64]Did somebody...
[110:18.21]Somebody just said I could fly if I point the minigun down.
[110:22.99]Alright, well, you lied to me.
[110:24.09]Alright, you lied to me.
[110:25.67]That's alright, but it's not like I've been lied to before.
[110:27.89]Not like I've been lied to before.
[110:31.13]Okay, it's... Why?
[110:32.99]Why do I continue to believe the things that some of you guys have to say?
[110:38.37]You could fucking fly if you hold the minigun down.
[110:40.93]Now, that would be really fucking cool.
[110:43.35]But that's not the case.
[110:45.59]Uh, let's go this way.
[110:58.74]This gun is good, but why would you use anything else?
[111:04.22]Don't ever use anything else.
[111:06.06]Just play this guy, use the minigun, and just murder people.
[111:15.85]I mean, I'm out of ammo, but that sure was fun.
[111:22.93]This looks like a squirt gun.
[111:31.87]use the uzi please yeah I keep forgetting I just have a super uzi there's nothing even in here yeah sorry if I've been using the ultra uzi I haven't been using the regular uzi oh great
[112:04.86]It's not bad, but it's a very small cliff.
[112:08.36]You'll constantly have to be reloading this damn thing.
[112:14.95]Somebody downstairs?
[112:18.17]Yes.
[112:26.09]I was gonna say, no way.
[112:30.43]Here we go!
[112:41.28]Mmm, frogs.
[112:42.34]Lots of frogs.
[112:47.36]Come on!
[112:48.37]Damn it!
[112:53.89]That's too much fun.
[113:01.09]Where's the ammo store?
[113:03.57]Well, watch out for the fucking clock from Beauty and the Beast!
[113:06.97]Hey, be our guest, motherfucker!
[113:10.92]That was a $20 joke.
[113:12.73]At least.
[113:13.17]That was a $60 fucking $70 joke.
[113:20.73]Epic Mario reference.
[113:22.15]Here we go.
[113:22.87]Wait, what?
[113:24.09]Did I do that?
[113:31.18]I did a Mario reference?
[113:32.88]When did I do that?
[113:34.88]Where are these last two frogs?
[113:36.18]There they are.
[113:41.24]That was close.
[113:46.90]That'll be $70.
[113:56.17]Tiny room.
[114:01.81]Keep moving.
[114:07.51]I must remember why I switched to this.
[114:09.85]That was a mistake.
[114:16.15]I'm too old to remember my own jokes.
[114:18.95]I did not do a here we go Mario joke reference.
[114:23.79]I did not do that.
[114:26.59]I swear to God that didn't happen.
[114:30.61]So you tell me I just went like, here we go.
[114:33.13]No, I didn't.
[114:34.89]Somebody clip that and show it to me because I don't believe you.
[114:36.95]Like, why would I do that?
[114:40.71]Yes, you did.
[114:41.23]No, I didn't.
[114:41.77]There's no way I did that.
[114:43.16]Why would I do that?
[114:46.81]I did?
[114:47.27]Why?
[114:51.14]I don't know why.
[114:55.50]He just predicted my movements so much.
[115:06.53]Stop trusting chat.
[115:11.59]I can't help it.
[115:12.45]I have to blindly trust everybody here.
[115:22.50]I trust you guys.
[115:27.84]I have dementia.
[115:28.90]Old man loses his marbles.
[115:35.77]I'm glad they do this.
[115:37.39]That's really great that they do that because that would be really annoying trying to find the last guy.
[115:40.99]Alright.
[115:45.07]Is this floor number three?
[115:49.26]Jeremy, you said, man, I love Mario.
[115:50.98]Haha, here we go.
[115:54.92]Do I trust my mother, Dermot?
[115:57.71]What are you guys even talking about?
[115:59.79]What are you guys talking about?
[116:08.87]Was not expecting that, but it's okay.
[116:15.81]Didn't want this.
[116:19.33]They're like blending in with the... Ow, that sucked.
[116:26.20]Oh my lord, I took so- Okay, please.
[116:29.47]No, don't.
[116:30.63]Stop this madness.
[116:33.07]Ayayay.
[116:34.05]And this one fucking frog dog.
[116:35.97]Great.
[116:49.89]Those are goats.
[116:50.55]I'm just realizing this.
[116:51.43]I'm just realizing this now.
[117:01.31]Frogdog XD.
[117:12.16]Frogdog and the fellowship of the ring.
[117:14.06]Can this only hold one shot at a time?
[117:17.74]There we go.
[117:29.21]Took me long enough.
[117:32.96]What is invincible?
[117:33.76]You know what?
[117:34.18]Shit, I keep forgetting that I have that.
[117:36.64]Thank you for reminding me.
[117:38.96]I'm gonna need to use that at some point.
[117:46.83]I'm gonna have to use that.
[117:48.01]Oh god, for the love of fucking hell, come on.
[118:07.33]It's just you three idiots.
[118:10.87]And I ran- Oh, come on!
[118:13.07]Really, no?
[118:13.95]Don't do this shit to me right now.
[118:21.09]What time is it?
[118:21.59]Oh, Etalyx.
[118:22.17]Yeah, Etalyx is- You're probably confused right now.
[118:25.30]See, what you don't understand, Etalyx, is right now, it is like 10 PM for you.
[118:29.34]And you're just really confused.
[118:32.98]Don't get hurt.
[118:36.08]Easy.
[118:37.75]not easy and this is why they call me the surgeon heavy bullets increases knockback on enemies sure thing
[119:08.55]And let's move.
[119:13.31]Medic main confirmed?
[119:14.83]What does that mean?
[119:22.25]Stop with the Mario references!
[119:25.33]Yeah, because Mario is such a surgeon.
[119:27.77]Oh wait, there is Dr. Mario.
[119:30.39]That's true.
[119:34.64]There is Dr. Mario.
[119:37.45]I know, I'm sorry guys.
[119:38.21]I'll stop with the Mario references.
[119:40.35]I'm more like surgeon talk.
[119:43.55]Talk to Mario is a thing.
[119:49.39]Where's this random guy right there?
[119:51.49]I'm not gonna hit him from over here.
[119:57.91]Wow!
[119:59.39]That's a firing squad.
[120:05.87]Went right over his fucking head.
[120:07.29]God damn it.
[120:15.78]Please.
[120:17.10]How many shots does he die?
[120:27.16]I need to get up there.
[120:27.94]I can't get up there to get these items that they're dropping.
[120:40.06]That was so close because I just stopped caring.
[120:44.51]Just a couple of little tippy taps to the face.
[120:58.08]I've got a pretty good time to use this, I think.
[120:59.52]Hey.
[121:06.33]That wasn't very nice.
[121:08.31]That wasn't very nice, Redneck Rampage guy.
[121:12.43]So when I first saw this on the Steam store, I really thought this was a sequel to Redneck Rampage.
[121:17.79]Or one of those old, like, Windows 98 Redneck games.
[121:20.73]I was like, did they really make one of these?
[121:26.13]It kind of is, though.
[121:27.52]I'm just realizing this now.
[121:29.06]What's down here?
[121:30.78]Uh, chest room?
[121:32.24]No, fuck it.
[121:32.82]Don't even care.
[121:33.72]Let's go to level 3.
[121:42.82]Old man streamer confirms his age.
[121:44.30]Yes, he does.
[121:44.78]Alright, third floor.
[121:49.11]This is where we die.
[121:49.67]Let me make sure I reload this junk.
[121:55.81]And we're gonna go and... We're gonna jump off the Sphinx.
[122:02.97]I told you.
[122:04.65]You know?
[122:10.61]Kinda wish it started you at full health, but you know, that's me being a whiny little baby about it.
[122:24.54]Oh shit, I didn't even see, I did not even see GLaDOS up there, goddammit.
[122:32.83]You say I look like Mario?
[122:37.21]Dude, I don't look a damn thing like Super Mario.
[122:42.68]I don't have a mustache.
[122:45.86]I'm not a fat guy.
[122:47.48]Mario's a fat guy.
[122:57.69]I'm the proper height.
[122:58.59]Mario's like 6'2".
[123:00.11]What are you talking about?
[123:00.93]Mario's like 6'4".
[123:01.97]Oh, we got a boss fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[123:14.00]Alright, let's see if I can beat this.
[123:22.31]I don't think I can hurt him.
[123:23.65]Okay, well, we got... Alright.
[123:25.91]I don't know what this means.
[123:29.67]Okay, yeah, you have to... Just go with the big guns.
[123:38.44]Just fucking crush his sarcophagi and kill him.
[123:41.72]That's the secret to beat him.
[123:48.58]Just destroy all of his tombs.
[123:52.36]Wow, what a great weapon to have for this.
[123:55.91]And then his eyes are going to open up and I'm going to shoot him in the face a thousand times.
[123:59.51]What?
[124:01.59]What?
[124:03.31]What's going on?
[124:06.35]What happened?
[124:07.96]I missed something here.
[124:09.46]Okay, hold on a second.
[124:10.66]What?
[124:26.24]We good.
[124:38.18]Shit.
[124:44.80]God fucking damn it!
[124:49.99]I have a right click and I wasn't even fucking using it.
[124:58.69]I keep forgetting about their fucking active skills.
[125:01.27]Oh my God, fuck me.
[125:11.15]Oh well.
[125:21.88]Streamer rage.
[125:22.68]I just like get fucking tired.
[125:26.74]I'm just a tired idiot.
[125:32.67]But, uh, anyways.
[125:33.40]I really, uh... I would have beat that.
[125:38.62]I was not... I just... Need to remember that people have abilities.
[125:46.61]Nice Mario reference to the... You know what?
[125:48.93]Hey, this Mario sucks!
[125:51.95]What was the last good Mario game?
[125:54.18]Mario fucking Sunshine?
[125:55.92]Mario 64?
[125:57.52]Mario fucking Galaxy?
[125:58.92]Mario Galaxy 2?
[126:00.04]New Super Mario Bros.
[126:01.40]3D?
[126:01.88]New Super Mario Bros.
[126:02.96]World?
[126:04.26]What was the last good Mario game?
[126:06.38]Like, are you serious?
[126:17.28]Huh?
[126:23.11]The joke is I just named all the last fucking Mario games.
[126:27.33]Don't you guys understand?
[126:30.09]I just named all the last five Mario games.
[126:33.01]That's the joke.
[126:33.97]Mario doesn't suck.
[126:34.95]Don't leave me.
[126:35.79]Don't unfollow me.
[126:37.51]Don't leave me.
[126:48.46]Don't leave me.
[126:55.57]Alright.
[127:00.73]Take care, everybody.
[127:02.05]Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers and all the people that have mothers.
[127:06.92]But let me say a couple of things here.
[127:10.10]I don't think I'm saying your name right, but thank you for the six bucks.
[127:13.34]They just say cheer 600.
[127:16.05]Thank you also to Control-Alt-Delicious for the 10 bucks a little while ago.
[127:20.66]Had no idea that the UK has a different Mother's Day than the US and just had a mini heart attack.
[127:25.02]Holy shit, dude.
[127:27.99]I hope you're alright.
[127:29.53]Hopefully you're doing okay, Control-Alt-Delicious.
[127:32.75]Hopefully things are good.
[127:34.45]Wish you the best of luck in your potential recovery.
[127:36.51]Hopefully you get to a good spot.
[127:41.05]Anyways, Fidox.
[127:42.95]Fid, thanks for the three bucks.
[127:44.15]Not much for subscribing to streamers.
[127:45.71]I can't regularly catch, so I have some bits to the forehead, you dingus.
[127:49.95]Well, thank you.
[127:50.89]Thank you, Fid.
[127:53.09]Also, Sweeten, Sweetenlo.
[127:55.13]Oh, no, no.
[127:55.49]The guy's name's not Sweetenlo.
[127:58.33]His name's like Sweetenor.
[128:00.01]I said Sweetenlo.
[128:01.95]But thank you for the two bucks.
[128:04.75]Also, Slade, thank you for the 150.
[128:08.08]Very much appreciate that.
[128:11.16]Yeah, early morning stream.
[128:14.42]Wanted to get one in.
[128:15.26]We're going to be playing this on Tuesday.
[128:16.60]This game is fucking a lot of fun.
[128:18.86]And we're going to see if we can get far enough.
[128:21.34]I'll make sure this time to right click.
[128:24.10]Using abilities is a good thing in games where, you know, this is very dangerous and difficulty is a little bit on the higher skill.
[128:31.97]Jeremy didn't actually have a heart attack.
[128:33.47]It was a phrase for being worried.
[128:34.83]Well, regardless.
[128:37.61]If that's the case, then that's the case.
[128:40.47]I will see you guys on Tuesday for more Immortal Redneck.
[128:44.99]And let's have some fun.
[128:46.53]I will have full Twitch integration next time.
[128:49.15]Don't worry.
[128:49.93]That will be activated.
[128:52.78]And have a good night.
[128:54.72]Have a good rest of your day.
[128:55.60]Happy Mother's Day.
[128:57.00]See you guys later.
[129:16.28]you
