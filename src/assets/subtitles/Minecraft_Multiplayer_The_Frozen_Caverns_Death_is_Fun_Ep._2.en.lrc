[04:21.76]And I'm over here trying to pass out wooden swords.
[04:24.63]I'll take a wooden sword.
[04:28.45]I will absolutely take a wooden sword.

[04:47.57]So we got some miracle grow right here.
[04:51.18]Ooh.
[04:52.36]I thought you were just... Look at your pants.

[04:57.90]Your pants are all the way up to your belly button.
[05:00.34]All right, back up, Jerma.
[05:01.96]Back up.
[05:02.79]A lot.
[05:03.15]They're all gonna die.
[05:07.49]Yeah, they blew it up.
[05:08.75]Aha, yeah.
[05:10.08]Oh, there's a bunch.
[05:10.84]There's two or three in there still.
[05:12.35]I'm going down.
[05:13.77]I'm going to bring the bow.
[05:17.01]And then there was one.
[05:18.89]I thought he got him.
[05:20.05]I thought he got him.
[05:21.01]Let's go together.
[05:21.62]Hang on, hang on.
[05:23.28]There's something in here.
[05:24.44]Look, look, look.
[05:25.48]This is what I wanted to explore before.
[05:26.84]I think, was there only one more in there?
[05:29.60]Did you get him?
[05:30.60]Was there only one more creeper in there?
[05:32.06]Yeah.
[05:32.70]He blew up.
[05:34.05]Alright.
[05:34.51]There's nothing in here now.
[05:35.71]Oh god, there's one in here.
[05:39.07]Alright, here's the thing.
[05:39.87]We gotta get back and get our stuff before it disappears, but... Sweet, I finished him off.
[05:44.93]Wait, why are these two fighting each other?
[05:48.60]Because one of them took damage from the other.
[05:53.52]Taking these guys down.
[05:54.50]I'm almost out of food though, so... Kind of a problem.
[05:58.63]Get out of here, spider.
[06:02.47]Anybody got any food?
[06:03.65]I need arrows.
[06:04.43]Do you guys have arrows?
[06:05.53]Yeah, I do not.
[06:06.57]Alright, cool.
[06:08.67]Alright, zombies are the primary target here.
[06:13.03]Yo, there's electric.
[06:14.47]Actually, let's just go to the melon farm.
[06:19.12]Venom sack, venom sack.
[06:20.42]Really should have attacked us during the day.
[06:23.52]Yeah, but where's the fun in that?
[06:26.28]So...
[06:30.32]There's another one, though.
[06:31.20]Come at me.
[06:31.70]Watch out.
[06:32.18]Come at me.
[06:32.66]Everybody, let's go.
[06:33.78]Don't go that way.
[06:34.88]Let's go, you son of a bitches.
[06:37.58]All of you.
[06:38.28]We'll take every single one of you on right now.
[06:43.31]Oh, there goes Jerma.
[06:45.81]But he took one for the team.
[06:47.63]Hey, at least we got some zombie flesh.
[06:51.05]Okay, so... I'll try to stay on the same path...
[06:58.67]Man, this bridge freaks me out.
[07:00.13]Yeah, it really does.
[07:00.87]It's just like, where am I gonna fall down?
[07:02.55]Watch out for that skelly on the left.
[07:06.44]Oh, there's a chest down there.
[07:08.85]Forget the chest, man.
[07:09.65]We gotta get that enchanted bow.
[07:15.59]Except everyone is... I think Jerma went the wrong way.
[07:18.51]Or did I go the wrong way?
[07:20.39]Oh, there he goes.
[07:22.60]Watch out, there's a skeleton that saw you.
[07:24.68]It's up to me and you, Lepter.
[07:26.02]I looked over to see where... Because I heard you say, I think you went the wrong way.
[07:28.81]I turned and I fell.
