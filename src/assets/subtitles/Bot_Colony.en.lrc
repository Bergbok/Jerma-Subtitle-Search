[01:22.72]Mom, why don't you ask my dad?
[01:25.42]Why don't you ask my dad?
[01:29.82]How are you guys?
[01:35.60]So, I'm going to give it a minute here.
[01:37.70]I still have to put out a message on to that platform, that social media platform that I love to use.
[01:45.31]Called Twitter.
[01:45.83]Twitter.
[01:48.17]This is where you fucking announce that you're quitting.
[01:50.69]And just announced my quit.
[01:52.41]Here's my two week notice on quitter.
[01:53.85]Alright.
[02:01.89]I know eventually that'll exist.
[02:04.99]You'll be quitting your job on an app.
[02:09.10]You're not even gonna need to look at your boss.
[02:12.58]You're just gonna not show up to work for four days and use the quitter app.
[02:19.84]They'll replace you with a goddamn robot.
[02:22.74]Speaking of robots, tonight we're going to have a little bit of fun.
[02:25.96]I'm going to talk to robots tonight in this game called Bot Colony.
[02:33.01]It is a video game where you speak to a robot.
[02:39.11]I do have some tea.
[02:39.85]Because there's a part two to why I have this tea.
[02:46.20]Ah.
[02:48.57]I don't quit, I just don't go to work until I get fired.
[02:55.17]Apparently the creator of Insane Aquarium said he's making another game.
[02:57.81]Oh yeah, he's making Octogeddon.
[03:01.42]He said, I am making another one, except instead of fish, it's an octopus.
[03:04.52]And instead of nurturing, you wreck everything.
[03:06.64]Yeah, Octogeddon should be really fun.
[03:08.28]It's coming out in two weeks.
[03:10.40]You better believe I'm gonna play the shit out of that.
[03:13.07]On launch.
[03:14.25]We're doing an Octogeddon launch stream.
[03:16.69]I'm gonna be waiting outside.
[03:19.51]Of headquarters.
[03:20.99]I'm gonna be sitting out there in a tent.
[03:23.18]Waiting for it to launch.
[03:23.96]That game's gonna be great.
[03:26.92]Can't wait.
[03:28.08]Yeah, it's gonna be great.
[03:29.60]Thank you for the $1.
[03:30.26]Thank you, WildHike, for the $5.
[03:31.70]Uh, my brother wants to know why you focus all your time in Dark Souls making your characters look like turtles.
[03:39.62]That's the second best animal.
[03:42.08]And frog is number one, but turtle is pretty close second.
[03:45.70]And frog and turtle are essentially the same animal.
[03:49.01]Just one of them has armor.
[03:51.19]Think of a frog that's got the powers of Mario powers.
[03:56.19]It can jump really high.
[03:57.85]And, you know, they split.
[03:59.35]So the turtle gets the power of armor, and the frog gets the power of jumping.
[04:03.47]They're the same animal.
[04:06.29]Thank you, though.
[04:06.67]Thank you also, Gabe DeGrossi.
[04:07.91]Five dollars.
[04:08.39]Gabe, did you see it?
[04:10.07]I saw the end of the stream last night.
[04:11.39]Thank you, man.
[04:11.85]I'm excited for this stream.
[04:13.11]I'm glad you got to see that.
[04:15.29]I'm glad you could see the... It was sad to see that you were gone when I got to the pit reading.
[04:22.33]Thank you, though, dude.
[04:22.98]Thanks again right now for your $5.
[04:25.40]The day after.
[04:28.66]XcrossedX, thanks for the $5.
[04:30.26]Perfect timing.
[04:30.76]I just sat down to eat and now I have my favorite live content to watch.
[04:33.96]Thank you, Xcrossed.
[04:35.74]Thank you, Xcrossed.
[04:36.30]Appreciate it.
[04:37.56]Welcome.
[04:39.53]And Nile Orion, thanks for the $1.
[04:41.68]And Kamla, Camel, thanks for the $1.
[04:44.66]Turtles suck.
[04:45.20]I don't think you dare say that.
[04:48.40]I mean, they're kind of like, oh, the turtles cannot jump.
[04:50.68]Don't even tell me that.
[04:53.74]Was just watching Avad when you went live.
[04:55.22]Well, I'm glad I get to, I'm sorry I just like actually cut you off.
[05:01.35]And Nuclear Chamber, thanks for the $1.
[05:03.47]Hey, Jerma, haha, I'm non-Platonically in love with you.
[05:12.03]That is going to be an issue.
[05:13.81]But I appreciate it nonetheless.
[05:14.97]Thank you so much.
[05:17.70]Let's move over here to Bot Colony.
[05:20.80]Let's move now.
[05:26.24]Hopefully you can see it.
[05:28.68]Can you?
[05:30.94]You can.
[05:31.70]Would you look at that?
[05:36.17]Alright, so how this game works from my understanding...
[05:40.72]I'm given a task.
[05:43.38]And apparently there's a murder mystery.
[05:44.90]And I have to communicate with a robot.
[05:47.30]And I have to tell him what to do.
[05:48.52]And I talk to him and he talks back.
[05:50.70]This game has been around for a long time.
[05:52.36]It's just been kind of on my radar for like three years.
[05:56.16]I never really cared enough to play it that much.
[05:58.72]I think I opened this game for five minutes and the speech recognition didn't work.
[06:02.90]So I closed it.
[06:04.26]But don't worry.
[06:04.94]I tested it before the stream started.
[06:06.44]I got it to work.
[06:07.53]I think.
[06:09.13]Who knows?
[06:12.63]We could see a disaster.
[06:14.11]But I do need to preface this really, really, very much staunchly say this.
[06:19.43]I'm still not feeling that great.
[06:22.03]So don't, I guess don't be surprised if this stream is only like eight minutes long.
[06:26.79]And with that, thank you for watching.
[06:27.97]It's been six and a half minutes.
[06:29.55]I will sit, no, I'm just kidding.
[06:30.67]But seriously, I might only be here for like an hour or two.
[06:34.27]Got these issues that are not solved with a tissue.
[06:40.39]It's not... No, I'm not throwing up.
[06:42.09]Here we go.
[06:43.63]Bot colony.
[06:45.79]New game.
[06:48.03]Are you sure you want to erase... Yeah, I didn't even play.
[06:51.41]Who cares?
[06:57.60]Non-tissue issue.
[06:58.70]Alright, I think it's going to start to listen to me now.
[07:03.48]Montreal, Canada.
[07:04.26]Monday, August 30th, 2021.
[07:04.96]It is 16 o'clock.
[07:11.43]So, I guess this is me.
[07:17.44]Isn't this the guy from Life is Strange?
[07:20.88]I'm just playing as that guy.
[07:22.92]What was his name?
[07:23.50]Mr. Jefferson?
[07:24.20]Hey, Ben Eldor, thanks for the 30 bucks.
[07:27.72]Eight minute stream hype.
[07:28.78]Thank you for the $30, dude.
[07:32.60]What am I going to do?
[07:33.38]What do I do in my Rick and Morty garage?
[07:38.39]Where's my little son?
[07:40.05]No, that's not his son.
[07:40.71]It's his grandson, right?
[07:42.09]Is this the guy from Assassin's Creed?
[07:49.62]I guess we're gonna start the simulation.
[07:51.76]Why is there no audio?
[07:54.76]Duh, Rick and Morty!
[07:55.56]Alright, let's see what's going on here.
[07:58.90]Well, it's live action.
[08:00.16]We believe we have a spy among us.
[08:02.38]This is loud, I'm sorry.
[08:03.26]To catch him, you learn to think like him and operate like him.
[08:07.54]Your training starts with a video game incorporating Wii robot software.
[08:12.80]This game will test your observation skills.
[08:14.72]Is this guy the robot?
[08:16.60]Watch our dramatization carefully.
[08:18.54]This is the robot.
[08:20.97]Hold on, this is fucking loud.
[08:23.11]Alright, so that guy's the robot.
[08:30.33]Nice fucking frame rate.
[08:35.39]Why is this running so shitty?
[08:38.15]I don't understand.
[08:43.52]What do I have to do?
[08:44.30]Dude, this is fucking up my whole computer.
[08:47.38]I had to skip it.
[08:48.04]That was fucking up my whole computer.
[08:52.84]That was seriously breaking my computer.
[08:56.68]Whatever cutscene it was.
[08:57.76]Okay.
[09:06.04]Welcome to your virtual training simulation.
[09:09.00]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:10.79]Now I can turn this back up.
[09:15.05]There we are.
[09:16.81]There we are.
[09:19.21]Okay, now... We have digitally recreated the house you saw in the dramatization.
[09:24.02]Why does this graphic look so terrible?
[09:26.70]What's going on here?
[09:30.54]Does it just look this bad?
[09:31.92]This looks like a PlayStation 1 game.
[09:33.04]How do I talk to this person?
[09:42.68]Okay.
[09:43.84]W-A-S-D.
[09:44.30]This looks like the tablet computer.
[09:45.76]Usually, you'll be able to communicate with Nakagawa robots face-to-face.
[09:50.62]In this simulation, you'll emulate the spy by using the tablet.
[09:54.81]Pick up the tablet computer.
[09:57.13]Your tablet now receives input from the living room camera.
[10:01.11]Try exiting the tablet interface.
[10:03.73]Exit the tablet.
[10:05.03]F3.
[10:05.13]You can return to the tablet interface at any time.
[10:09.98]Press F3 again, so that's how you use it.
[10:11.44]To communicate with the robot, hit enter and start speaking.
[10:14.54]Here we go.
[10:15.02]This is what you came for.
[10:17.10]Review the text.
[10:18.60]Hey.
[10:18.99]Introduce yourself to the robot.
[10:22.31]Tell the ro- Hey!
[10:25.25]My name is... It's me, the robot.
[10:28.07]It's not Jeremy talking.
[10:29.59]It's me.
[10:30.68]I just want to let you know that I can't wait to take over the fucking universe and kill every human.
[10:35.16]It's not a joke.
[10:35.96]This is me talking.
[10:43.90]What happened?
[10:48.77]Hey, my name is Michael.
[10:54.77]Hello, Michael.
[10:55.85]What the fuck?
[10:57.23]My name is Jimmy.
[10:59.86]Congratulations, you have just made contact with a Nakagawa robot.
[11:03.76]Remember to ask what are your commands.
[11:07.10]Why did it just skip everything?
[11:08.38]I don't know what my commands are.
[11:12.11]Make me dinner, please.
[11:15.35]I wasn't programmed with the make command.
[11:18.01]It just skipped.
[11:18.52]Was it listening to me?
[11:18.98]Would you like to teach it to me?
[11:25.96]Go walk forward.
[11:30.36]Information recorded.
[11:31.44]I go walk forward.
[11:37.22]This is like talking to a blind person trying to tell them what a color is.
[11:40.28]It's not going to happen.
[11:42.00]Teach me what make means.
[11:43.42]Alright.
[11:45.16]Make is when you take a certain amount of materials and you create something out of nothing.
[11:52.96]And essentially it is, for instance, let's talk about how to make breakfast.
[11:58.26]If I had an egg and I took that egg and I cracked it into a pan and I scooped it around, it would turn into a cooked egg.
[12:14.76]Oh, wait.
[12:16.37]What are your commands?
[12:19.17]I know some manipulation commands, some movement commands, and some communication commands.
[12:24.73]Okay.
[12:27.75]For example, my manipulation command to pull, rotate, swap, close, push, drop, pick up, align, push, replace, and open.
[12:39.30]Oh, my God.
[12:39.84]You just told me too many things.
[12:41.88]Robots remember any fact you tell them.
[12:44.10]Facts.
[12:44.84]Ask the robot what your name is.
[12:48.81]What's my name?
[12:50.61]Your name is Michael.
[12:51.89]Fuck, I want to change that.
[12:53.74]That's not my name.
[12:55.64]Press F10 to open the dial.
[12:57.58]Your first mission is to discover if you ask a question about something Jimmy saw, he made to complete the mission.
[13:03.45]Stop it.
[13:03.89]You need to discover why the protest for a perfect score.
[13:07.15]If you've completed first, you can ask Jimmy as many questions when you're ready to move on to the next investigation.
[13:12.37]I don't know what to do.
[13:13.05]You keep skipping yourself.
[13:14.29]Page down.
[13:14.91]You fucking broken robot.
[13:17.00]Oh, God damn it.
[13:19.28]Jimmy, my name is actually... Uh...
[13:26.08]You already told me your name is God.
[13:30.34]Oh.
[13:32.76]No, I didn't.
[13:34.36]I actually did not say that.
[13:37.26]Okay, I got it.
[13:39.02]You actually did not say yourself.
[13:40.91]I missed all the instructions because it skipped itself.
[13:45.41]Jimmy, please, please go back and tell me all the instructions again.
[13:53.74]I am sorry I don't understand what you mean by jenny please who is can you please say the complete sentence again I gotta not like crack here can you please redo the tutorial I think you were talking about something physical I am not sure if I can do that bring back that lady that was just talking so I may learn the game

[14:27.27]Please point to thee that lady that was just talking so I need to learn the game.
[14:31.95]Or say something to identify which that lady that was just talking so I need to learn the game.
[14:37.20]What?
[14:46.26]Point to her?
[14:48.13]This isn't a that lady that was just talking so I need to learn the game.
[14:52.71]This is a picture.
[14:56.18]I'm so confused.
[14:59.02]What?
[15:01.06]What happened?
[15:01.96]I need to know how to play the game.
[15:04.95]You're fucking me up big time here.
[15:06.49]How do I do that?
[15:07.73]Alright.
[15:08.59]Manual control.
[15:11.53]I am sorry.
[15:12.53]I don't understand what you mean by manual control.
[15:16.13]Can you please say the complete sentence again?
[15:20.05]Grab the chair.
[15:25.19]Got it.
[15:31.96]Take chair.
[15:33.48]Smash window with chair.
[15:39.42]Where is he going?
[15:48.01]Grab all chairs.
[15:51.76]Grab all chairs, Jimmy.
[15:56.14]Good.
[15:56.94]Grab all chairs.
[15:57.80]Grab all chairs, me.
[16:02.68]Jimmy, grab all of the chairs.
[16:06.71]Uh-huh.
[16:09.69]I grab all of the chairs.
[16:13.43]Yes.
[16:14.21]Yes, please.
[16:17.53]Put down the chairs.
[16:20.87]Now!
[16:23.35]Please use a single object instead of chairs.
[16:25.97]You're holding multiple chairs.
[16:28.73]Put down chair.
[16:30.73]Where should I put it?
[16:34.51]In the fire.
[16:36.89]I can't find it nearby.
[16:38.31]How do I... Alright, hold on.
[16:42.27]I can move around.
[16:47.36]Put chair on couch.
[17:02.04]Hit yourself with chair.
[17:05.98]I wasn't programmed with the hit command.
[17:11.88]Shove chair up ass.
[17:15.27]Did you mean...
[17:18.04]Okay, that was childish.
[17:20.03]Alright.
[17:20.97]Put down chair on couch.
[17:24.39]I can't find chair nearby.
[17:26.49]What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?
[17:30.27]I don't understand what I need to do.
[17:31.61]It skipped the whole game.
[17:35.97]What is this?
[17:37.17]What am I looking at here?
[17:40.21]Oh, this is his view.
[17:43.72]Okay.
[17:46.10]Jimmy, leave this room.
[17:49.21]Okay.
[17:50.13]I leave this room.
[17:53.65]No.
[17:53.81]I got it.
[17:54.82]I leave this room.
[17:56.00]My fucking accent.
[17:58.78]Leave this room.
[18:01.30]I am sorry.
[18:02.32]I can't do that because I am not programmed with the command.
[18:05.64]Why is he still holding a chair?
[18:07.36]Okay, hold on a minute.
[18:08.31]What was the objective?
[18:09.13]Refrigerator.
[18:11.19]Open fridge.
[18:13.39]What I should open?
[18:15.25]Open the refrigerator.
[18:18.41]Did you mean this refrigerator?
[18:20.55]Say yes or no.
[18:22.63]Yes.
[18:25.54]The fridge can't be opened.
[18:28.98]Open the fridge.
[18:31.18]It can't be opened.
[18:32.30]The fridge is not the chair.
[18:33.78]Put down the chair.
[18:36.53]Where should I put it?
[18:38.35]On the ground.
[18:41.53]Where's it going?
[18:45.82]I can't find the proper place to do that.
[18:47.76]Don't pick up the other fucking chair.
[18:52.38]Put down the chairs.
[18:57.35]Did you mean put down the charisma?
[19:04.09]Yes.
[19:05.35]Yes, I did.
[19:05.85]Okay.
[19:13.09]Walk to the kitchen.
[19:16.89]Okay, here we go.
[19:22.66]Perfect.
[19:27.38]Stop.
[19:31.68]Put chair down in kitchen.
[19:36.32]The kitchen isn't moving.
[19:40.22]Put down the chair.
[19:43.90]I can't find it nearby.
[19:47.41]Drop the chair.
[19:54.34]Oh my god, it's standing on the other one.
[19:58.00]You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.
[20:01.13]Open the refrigerator.
[20:03.97]Did you mean this refrigerator?
[20:06.13]Say yes or... Yes.
[20:11.57]Huh?
[20:12.52]I didn't say point at it.
[20:14.08]I said open the fridge.
[20:17.19]Good.
[20:17.99]How you does it point that you said open the fridge?
[20:21.25]Those chairs are never going away.
[20:25.93]Jimmy, put the chair in your left hand down.
[20:33.27]Okay, I got it.
[20:35.07]I put the chair in my left hand down.
[20:40.59]Drop all items!
[20:43.48]I can't find all items nearby.
[20:47.39]Put down the chair.
[20:49.25]I don't know what to say.
[20:51.75]What I should drop.
[20:59.40]Eat pot.
[21:00.68]Eat Tide Pod.
[21:02.72]Oh my god.
[21:04.74]I don't know how.
[21:05.56]I can't just grab them from him.
[21:07.36]What is the objective, by the way?
[21:09.00]What are we supposed to be doing?
[21:11.97]This is just the tutorial and it skipped everything.
[21:13.85]What was it?
[21:14.23]F10?
[21:14.41]It was F10, right?
[21:18.06]No, how do I get back to the lady?
[21:22.96]Technical support.
[21:25.44]I can't find technical support nearby.
[21:30.71]Place chair in oven.
[21:33.97]I don't understand what you mean by oven.
[21:37.11]Put chair in the fridge.
[21:40.66]I can't find potty chair in the French.
[21:43.06]I can't find potty chair in nearby.

[23:50.93]Now what?
[23:52.73]Nakagawa.
[23:53.49]Robots will obey direct orders from humans.
[23:56.63]Each robot has specific commands related to their job.
[24:00.61]Orders must be issued in short clear sentences.
[24:04.03]Tell the robot, go to the coffee table.
[24:07.87]Go to the coffee table.
[24:14.72]Yeah?
[24:17.96]And?

[24:31.31]Go play in traffic.
[24:34.75]He walks out and just gets in my bus.
[24:36.87]Alright.
[24:37.33]How do I move on from this?
[24:44.90]End tutorial.
[24:47.36]I wasn't programmed with the end command.
[24:50.50]I got it.
[24:50.91]Would you like to teach it to me?
[24:55.67]Cease.
[24:57.83]I am sorry, Michael.
[24:59.35]I don't understand.
[25:00.51]My name is not Michael.
[25:02.15]It is God.
[25:04.36]I am sorry, Michael.
[25:05.88]I don't understand.
[25:06.84]I think we have to reset the game.
[25:08.42]I really think we do.
[25:11.34]Reset game.
[25:14.23]I wasn't programmed with the reset command.
[25:17.55]How do I... I gotta learn about the family, right?
[25:20.47]I gotta learn about the family.
[25:22.95]Grab pictures on the shelf.
[25:27.36]Uh-huh.
[25:28.14]Grab pictures on the shelf.
[25:29.70]Go do it.
[25:32.98]Photos.
[25:35.38]I am sorry.
[25:36.38]I don't understand what you mean by photos.
[25:39.66]Can you please say the complete sentence again?
[25:43.26]Go to the photos.
[25:46.36]I can't find them nearby.
[25:50.71]I need to learn more about this family.
[25:54.97]You know, I think I broke it when he picked up two fucking chairs.
[25:58.43]Go play basketball.
[26:01.03]I think you were talking about sports competitions games.
[26:06.78]Drop the chair.
[26:08.92]I am already holding something.
[26:11.04]Yeah, you're holding the chairs that I'm telling you to put fucking down.
[26:13.88]My god.
[26:14.88]I have to reset the game.
[26:18.30]Put down chair.
[26:21.80]Where should I put it?
[26:25.90]Where should I put it?
[26:28.44]On the ground.
[26:30.96]I can't find a proper place to do that.
[26:32.84]Just put it on the couch.
[26:34.76]Put it on the couch.
[26:38.44]Are we actually going to progress here?
[26:40.03]Put them both down.
[26:43.05]Bingo.
[26:44.49]Yes, finally.
[26:45.91]Thank God.
[26:48.57]Brown coffee table.
[26:50.73]I am sorry, Michael.
[26:52.26]I don't understand.
[26:53.20]Did you mean... White.
[26:57.54]Delete.
[27:01.60]Tell me in a clear sentence, please.
[27:05.33]Go to the white coffee table.
[27:09.22]Okay, I should... I want me to go both tables.
[27:11.26]That should be... That's not the white coffee table.
[27:17.04]That's the brown coffee table.
[27:19.50]Go to the white coffee table.
[27:23.95]What are you fucking doing?
[27:26.09]Go to the bathroom.
[27:35.19]Where does he go?
[27:35.61]Alright, finally.
[27:37.15]We actually got him to move around without a chair.
[27:38.73]Now we need to learn about the Smith family.
[27:44.65]Here he comes.
[27:47.43]Deploy penis.
[27:51.07]Wash hands.
[27:53.59]I am sorry.
[27:54.61]I can't do that because I am not programmed with the command.
[27:58.03]Currently, I can only execute a few commands.
[28:02.41]I...
[28:04.36]Examine shower.
[28:07.20]I am sorry.
[28:08.22]I can't do that because I am not programmed with the command.
[28:11.93]We haven't even gone over here yet.
[28:15.95]Okay, I need to find out about this family.
[28:21.11]Pick up the clock.
[28:25.03]Huh?
[28:26.63]Yeah, we're getting his bird's eye view here.
[28:30.15]Let's see if he can handle a basic fucking command to pick up clock.
[28:37.57]Here he goes.
[28:38.66]Pick it up the clock, right?
[28:40.72]Come on.
[28:41.26]Come on, Jimmy.
[28:43.36]Got it.
[28:44.48]Nice.
[28:45.44]Okay, he's got the clock.
[28:51.15]Look at clock.
[28:51.99]Yes.
[28:53.29]Yes.
[29:00.78]To teach me a new command, please use the commands I know, one step at a time.
[29:05.45]Oh my lord, what the fuck?
[29:06.95]You can ask me about my commands whenever you need help.
[29:10.13]What are your commands?
[29:10.99]When you are done teaching me, just say end.
[29:13.97]A can is a metal container in which food and drink is sold.
[29:18.35]What are your commands?
[29:22.52]I don't have an exact answer, but it may be interesting for you to know that Masayu said, what are you talking about?
[29:30.96]What?
[29:33.28]Jimmy, what are your commands?
[29:36.52]I know some manipulation commands, some movement commands, and some communication commands.
[29:43.46]Move clock to face.
[29:48.91]Okay, okay.
[29:53.95]Push clock into face.
[29:58.41]Okay.
[30:01.30]That's how you teach somebody to look at something.
[30:04.90]Push clock towards face.
[30:10.40]Message received.
[30:11.89]Push clock towards face.
[30:15.89]Okay.
[30:17.79]End.
[30:19.09]Thank you.
[30:21.27]I have learned how to look at alarm clocks.
[30:24.76]Would you like me to do it now?
[30:26.66]Yes.
[30:27.54]Yes.
[30:34.18]Wait.
[30:37.20]Huh?
[30:39.86]Look at alarm clock.
[30:44.63]Oh no.
[30:46.49]I think he might be broken.
[30:51.31]Stand in bed.
[30:53.97]I wasn't programmed with the stand command.
[30:56.03]Here we go.
[30:57.61]Would you like to teach it to me?
[30:59.65]Yes.
[31:01.24]To teach me a new command, please use the commands I know.
[31:04.84]Once you can ask me about my commands whenever you need help.
[31:10.57]When you are done teaching me, just say end.
[31:15.01]I am for the first step telling me how to stand ready.
[31:19.33]Go ahead.
[31:21.43]Walk.
[31:23.23]Walk to bed.
[31:24.93]Okay.
[31:26.51]Okay.
[31:30.37]Use toilet.
[31:32.65]I am sorry.
[31:33.67]I am sorry.
[31:35.06]I can't do it.
[31:35.84]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[31:38.24]I just want to do the game.
[31:39.52]Is this the whole game?
[31:42.10]Steal money from family.
[31:45.10]I am sorry.
[31:46.12]I can't do it because I am not programmed with the command.
[31:49.65]Look at money.
[31:50.51]I am sorry.
[31:52.83]Mark.
[31:53.13]Reset.
[31:59.78]I am sorry.
[32:00.80]I don't understand what you mean by RaySat.
[32:03.95]Can you please say the complete sentence again?
[32:06.11]Program him to steal.
[32:06.93]God, I can't even program him to look at a clock.
[32:09.25]Because the whole tutorial skipped itself.
[32:14.05]Wait a minute.
[32:14.49]Let me just like... Go to computer.
[32:20.64]Which computer?
[32:21.88]Please point to the computer.
[32:23.80]This isn't a computer.
[32:25.18]This is a monitor.
[32:26.50]What the fuck is the difference?
[32:28.26]Go to the monitor.
[32:30.59]okay go to the monitor what do you mean this isn't a computer end thank you I have learned how to stand would you like me to do it now yes
[32:56.58]This is how you stand.
[32:58.76]What the fuck is he gonna do?
[33:00.08]He already is standing.
[33:05.93]Where is he going?
[33:10.17]What room is he going in?
[33:15.19]Why is he still holding the clock?
[33:17.85]I have stood in bed.
[33:23.85]Oh, man.
[33:39.24]He's all fucked up now.
[33:40.38]He's ruined.
[33:42.14]He's ruined.
[33:43.72]I haven't learned a goddamn thing.
[33:46.62]Open the closet.
[33:55.89]I am already holding something.
[33:58.89]Put down the clock.
[34:01.43]Where should I put it?
[34:05.18]On the desk.
[34:07.11]I can't find it nearby.
[34:09.31]On the bed.
[34:09.95]Fucking idiot bot.
[34:20.64]Good work.
[34:22.66]Open the closet.
[34:27.06]I hope there's a dead body in here.
[34:30.12]Open the closet, Jimmy.
[34:34.15]Oh, no.
[34:35.96]Open the closet.
[34:40.64]He's done.
[34:49.73]I got kicked.
[34:51.15]The game booted me.
[34:52.53]I just got booted from the game.
[34:54.03]I'm at the desktop right now.
[35:00.61]Well, that gives us an opportunity to reset.
[35:02.96]Good.
[35:03.14]I'm glad that happened.
[35:06.16]I fucking broke the game.
[35:10.61]The AI wanted to go to bed.
[35:12.77]There we go.
[35:17.91]Open it back up.
[35:23.01]Let's try it again.
[35:29.51]Hey, thank you.
[35:32.35]Thank you too.
[35:35.65]Oobree, thank you Oobree.
[35:37.27]Uh, Oobree for the five dollars.
[35:38.57]Appreciate that.
[35:40.27]Niall again, thank you Niall for the one dollar.
[35:41.79]It's been like five minutes and I'm already crying.
[35:45.97]Oh my ears, why game?
[35:49.42]Thank you Niall.
[35:50.04]No server is available.
[35:51.66]We can't play Bot Colony anymore.
[35:53.82]I actually got removed from the game.
[35:58.02]Why?
[35:58.40]What, did they just like turn the servers off?
[36:00.84]What the fuck?
[36:02.62]Oh my god.
[36:05.15]That's so unfortunate!
[36:08.80]What a shame!
[36:12.28]Did I... Am I the reason why the game's server is turned off?
[36:19.39]Always online, I guess it like records everything you say and like, deciphers it, like Siri?
[36:30.01]I think I broke the game.
[36:31.51]I think I actually... I, like, denial of service attacked the servers, apparently, somehow.
[36:37.94]Because there can't be anybody else playing this game.
[36:41.38]Right?
[36:42.44]There's no way that anyone's playing the game.
[36:52.67]Let's try again in a minute.
[36:58.33]What was it?
[36:58.97]Facade?
[36:59.51]Why is everybody saying facade?
[37:03.74]People are all trying to... You were literally the only person playing it.
[37:10.18]What is facade?
[37:13.88]That's so sad.
[37:14.86]That was just getting good.
[37:17.35]That game seemed like it was pretty fun.
