[00:08.72]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.26]Jeremiah here with Theme Hospital.
[00:14.00]Now, this is kind of going to be in the Enlightened series, I guess you could say, even though it's been a million years since you've last seen Enlightened, but can you even read this text?
[00:24.08]I don't know, whatever, you can't rig it.
[00:25.78]I know how to play.
[00:26.52]This used to be one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 1, if you could believe it.
[00:30.97]And you run your own hospital.
[00:32.51]It's one of the first... I can't really say first, but it's one of the original hospital sims.
[00:39.05]It might even be the only hospital sim.
[00:40.81]I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:43.21]But we're going to get right into this here.
[00:45.00]I'm just going to play until I don't care anymore.
[00:47.52]Maybe like 10, 15 minutes.
[00:49.20]If you want to see more of Theme Hospital...
[00:51.86]Then let me know.
[00:52.84]But I should probably get going because the hospital opens in like 35 seconds.
[00:57.76]So let's go.
[00:58.48]I know I need a GP's office.
[01:01.59]And it works just like the Sims.
[01:03.25]Where you kind of build rooms.
[01:04.37]You build individual walls.
[01:07.79]I don't want the GP's office that huge.
[01:10.61]That looks good.
[01:12.65]That's not a valid blueprint.
[01:13.97]Well, screw you.
[01:15.35]Now it is.
[01:15.77]Check.
[01:16.37]Check.
[01:17.91]Got to put the door on.
[01:18.87]A couple of windows.
[01:20.73]All right.
[01:21.86]So this is where people come into the hospital.
[01:23.80]The whole point of this... Oh, damn it.
[01:25.40]Hold on.
[01:25.68]I didn't mean to do that.
[01:27.56]Pick that up.
[01:29.00]Pick up the... Whatever.
[01:31.12]My doctor doesn't even need to face his patients.
[01:33.38]I really don't care.
[01:34.52]But this guy's going to give me tips and tricks as we go.
[01:36.93]But whatever.
[01:38.39]So when people walk in the door with an illness, let's say, I have a cough.
[01:42.49]My chest hurts.
[01:44.09]Then they go to the receptionist, who is not currently here yet, but I'm going to make her.
[01:51.69]Uh, where is... facilities, clinics, treatment... Where the hell is the reception?
[01:58.31]Oh, there it is.
[01:59.09]Reception desk.
[02:00.95]And that's the build button.
[02:03.33]So people come right... should we make it like right here so they don't have to wait in line at all?
[02:07.80]Yeah, we will.
[02:09.76]Gotta hire a receptionist.
[02:13.10]Alright, who can we hire?
[02:14.28]Kay Kingsmith.
[02:16.42]She seems like a bitch.
[02:17.74]I don't think we want her.
[02:19.90]F. Petcliffe enjoys river widening, poorly trained and... I thought that said reckless.
[02:28.09]Feckless.
[02:30.09]What?
[02:30.29]Is that an F?
[02:32.55]Am I crazy?
[02:33.42]Why is that an F?
[02:34.76]Poorly trained and feckless.
[02:37.69]Alright, well, anyways, she's reckless.
[02:39.16]I don't want her.
[02:40.54]Drinks wine dedicated to helping people with a smile.
[02:43.42]You know, she might be drunk, but she's gonna take the job seriously.
[02:48.16]Except she's, like, walking the wrong way.
[02:50.10]Honey.
[02:50.88]Honey, you're the recep- Oh, no, that's a nurse!
[02:53.08]Shit.
[02:55.26]It's okay, we'll need her later.
[02:56.76]Here's the receptionist.
[02:57.55]Here we go.
[02:59.76]Very friendly.
[03:00.46]Very friendly.
[03:01.02]Yeah.
[03:01.78]I accidentally made a stupid nurse that's not gonna do anything till we meet her later.
[03:04.53]Okay, whatever.
[03:05.47]I need a doctor.
[03:06.11]This hospital's gonna open soon.
[03:07.67]Gotta get a doctor to in the doctor's office.
[03:10.55]Alright, we could do this guy.
[03:13.21]An expert at DIY.
[03:14.79]Rude and abrasive.
[03:16.63]Gets people's backs up.
[03:18.49]Gets people's backs up.
[03:21.96]What kind of an explanation?
[03:24.06]Tickles Trout?
[03:25.32]No, stop it.
[03:26.74]Enjoys French arthouse films?
[03:29.40]Alright, well this guy's alright.
[03:30.27]He likes, like, films.
[03:31.69]Go work there, you son of a bitch.
[03:34.95]Alright, we've got our doctor that sees the patients, we've got our nurse wandering aimlessly, and we have our reception right at the front door.
[03:41.49]So, we need... We need general diagnostics.
[03:46.45]We'll put that right next to...
[03:50.50]You are so loud, lady.
[03:52.62]I wish you didn't just scream in my ear.
[03:55.56]I'm gonna put a couple benches over here.
[03:57.77]Don't worry, this is where people get diagnosed.
[04:01.03]The changing screen will go... Right next to the window.
[04:04.93]I want people to get, like, seen naked.
[04:08.29]This, like, weird machine can go over here.
[04:10.06]And here we go.
[04:12.93]I believe we need a doctor to actually be in here.
[04:16.57]To, like, take care of people.
[04:18.19]And this guy's gonna have to, like, do two things at once.
[04:19.78]Do we have any patients yet?
[04:20.56]No, the door of the hospital's not even open.
[04:22.68]Wandering nurse is okay for the time being.
[04:25.52]I need a janitor, I know that.
[04:28.06]Alright, Grandpa collects World War II shrapnel and, uh... Go back.
[04:34.12]Well, he already got fired.
[04:35.80]Smuggles fake watches.
[04:37.26]Superb stamina.
[04:38.30]You know, he just keeps going.
[04:39.66]You know, it's Grandpa.
[04:40.60]Alright, well, just go over there.
[04:41.76]Screw you.
[04:44.10]Hospital's open.
[04:45.06]The hospital is officially open.
[04:46.34]We're gonna get some people with some weird diseases to walk up this... weird, like, Tetris hallway.
[04:53.42]Okay.
[04:56.60]Look at this guy!
[04:57.12]He's freaking out!
[04:58.46]Hey, dude, somebody gave, like, Grandpa too much coffee.
[05:03.04]I gotta go!
[05:03.52]I gotta go!
[05:03.78]Where's your stuff?
[05:04.26]Where's your trash?
[05:05.60]What a psycho!
[05:07.12]Somebody needs to slow him down.
[05:09.26]Do we have any patients yet?
[05:10.14]Uh-oh.
[05:11.52]Ladies and gentlemen, we got a live one.
[05:13.91]Okay, he's going to go over here.
[05:15.28]Actually, I want benches.
[05:16.16]I want benches.
[05:17.74]Bench to go right here.
[05:22.50]Come in.
[05:23.24]I'm taking a dump.
[05:24.90]See, this guy diagnoses the problem.
[05:26.70]He sends him over to the other doctor that does not exist yet, but he will very shortly.
[05:30.26]Doctor.
[05:33.18]I'm working on it.
[05:34.12]I'm working on it.
[05:35.34]Whatever.
[05:35.68]You can do it.
[05:36.10]It doesn't matter.
[05:37.51]Hey, I just got this job five seconds ago.
[05:41.00]You've satisfied the financial criteria for this level.
[05:43.08]Now keep your balance above a thousand while making sure your hospital is running efficiently.
[05:46.87]Where are people going?
[05:47.95]Alright, just diagnose this guy.
[05:52.15]Grandpa's still on crack.
[05:53.55]That's fine.
[05:55.63]Okay, we need... We got diagnosis.
[06:00.10]We could go for a psychiatric ward, I think.
[06:02.08]In case any people come in that need to get their mental health in check.
[06:06.56]I know I need a pharmacy, and that gives a place for the nurse to go who's wandering around.
[06:09.86]Let's see.
[06:11.62]Yeah, he's going.
[06:12.52]Don't worry.
[06:14.00]Pharmacy will be over here.
[06:14.96]A little bit bigger.
[06:17.76]That's good.
[06:19.62]Gonna put you to work, nurse.
[06:21.02]Because you're kind of just doing nothing.
[06:22.54]You're just wasting like $100 an hour for me.
[06:25.71]Alright, get in there.
[06:28.79]You.
[06:29.97]Get.
[06:31.83]Get in there.
[06:32.55]I just put her in.
[06:34.59]British lady, that's yelling at me, I understand.
[06:36.71]Okay, we got another one.
[06:38.65]Where'd that patient go?
[06:39.37]Where'd that first patient go?
[06:40.27]Oh, he's gonna go get, like, a drink.
[06:42.57]Alright.
[06:43.33]Let's see if we can cure our first patient.
[06:47.58]How do you feel?
[06:49.24]You paid me $400.
[06:51.66]Sick.
[06:53.04]Thank you for coming to the hospital, sir.
[06:54.70]I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
[06:55.96]Hopefully you don't go home and insta-puke.
[06:57.98]Well, thanks for the high rating, too.
[06:59.50]I appreciate that.
[07:00.30]Thank you.
[07:00.68]Doctor required in general...
[07:02.81]Oh, shit.
[07:03.71]Where is he?
[07:04.99]Yeah, get over there!
[07:06.55]You chump!
[07:07.25]Yeah, he's knocking on the door.
[07:08.41]He's standing in front of him.
[07:10.11]Okay, I gotta make another, um... Ah, facilities.
[07:15.52]Need some... I need some bathrooms.
[07:17.80]Bathrooms will go up here.
[07:20.63]Yeah!
[07:21.83]That's a pretty huge bathroom.
[07:24.61]Yeah, uh, there's one... Oh, man.
[07:26.97]This bathroom's way too big.
[07:29.27]You know, just because I'm a cynical dick, I'm gonna put the staff room next to the toilets, because I'm just a jerk, I'm a bad boss, and you should feel bad working for me.
[07:41.44]Grandpa, get out of the way!
[07:43.46]I can't build this if you're standing on it!
[07:47.58]Has he done any work?
[07:49.84]He's just been running a marathon around this whole damn place.
[07:52.68]Okay.
[07:53.94]There's the sofa.
[07:55.90]That's okay.
[07:56.46]Got the staff room now in case somebody wants to chill out.
[07:58.68]No, there's no trash.
[08:00.60]Where's this guy going?
[08:03.96]He's going to get a potion, I think, to the pharmacy?
[08:07.42]Yeah, pay me my money.
[08:08.44]I'm the goddamn hospital owner.
[08:09.96]I'll inject you with this syringe I got.
[08:11.70]We're going to cure our second patient.
[08:18.73]Oh, yeah.
[08:20.13]Okay.
[08:21.47]How we doing?
[08:21.87]How we doing?
[08:22.29]We got our consistency?
[08:24.25]What is this guy?
[08:26.91]Oh my god!
[08:28.09]Who let, like, Uncle Fester in here?
[08:31.29]Well, I gotta get, like, a- He's a baby!
[08:34.25]It's a baby!
[08:37.94]This guy has a baby face.
[08:39.80]That's his disease.
[08:41.88]Uh, yeah, doctor, I, you know, I'm not sure if you can realize this or not, but I have a friggin' baby face.
[08:48.56]How do you cure this?
[08:49.74]This guy needs to go into, like, surgery.
[08:53.50]Apparently, apparently the baby face disease is an epidemic in this city.
[08:58.34]Look at this guy.
[08:59.20]Except he's, like, blonde.
[09:01.43]Oh, wait, no, I remember.
[09:02.37]I gotta make an inflation station.
[09:04.41]That rhymed.
[09:04.97]Uh, clinics, inflation, there it is.
[09:10.20]This will go down here.
[09:11.24]There's no space over here.
[09:13.68]But yeah, you can get this game right now on Good Old Games.
[09:17.28]It's a doozy.
[09:19.22]Let's go with this.
[09:21.64]It's a doozy.
[09:22.43]I believe... I don't want to say an incorrect amount of money.
[09:24.99]I forget.
[09:25.63]It's like less than $10.
[09:27.03]It's like... I think it's like $6 or $7 for this game on GOG.com.
[09:31.33]Theme Hospital is the name again.
[09:32.75]You probably saw the title.
[09:34.13]So, I mean, whatever.
[09:35.41]Do we need another nurse?
[09:36.19]I think we do.
[09:37.24]Or does a doctor have to do this?
[09:40.77]I'm not sure.
[09:41.41]I'm sure the lady will yell at me once I find out what.
[09:45.11]No, we got the invisible man.
[09:46.27]He's like the invisible disease.
[09:47.43]Alright, now I need another doctor.
[09:49.12]Gotta hire another doctor.
[09:50.16]How are my resources doing?
[09:51.40]Pretty good.
[09:51.76]Alright, I'm gonna find a good doctor.
[09:56.50]Ex-quiz show host.
[09:58.00]Rash and easily distracted.
[10:00.48]Sings in a rock and roll band?
[10:02.22]Absolutely.
[10:02.90]You are the new hiree.
[10:04.86]Now let's, like, take some of that air out of your face.
[10:08.96]Oh!
[10:16.35]Keep in mind, guys, that guy just paid me $850 to stick a needle in his face and blow his head up.
[10:22.83]That probably was very painful.
[10:26.83]Okay, okay, okay.
[10:31.06]This guy... We have exhausted all of our diagnosis machines on this patient and we are still not sure what is wrong.
[10:38.54]What shall we do with the patient?
[10:39.64]There's a 72% chance that we have identified what type of invisibility the patient has.
[10:45.32]Do I send him home, take a chance on a cure, or should I get him to wait while I build more diagnostic rooms?
[10:54.10]That 72% is pretty high.
[10:55.52]I'm going to go ahead and say go for it.
[10:59.16]Go for it.
[11:01.06]This is the guy, right?
[11:03.88]Let's see if it works.
[11:05.98]I got one of the best nurses in the city working for me, dude.
[11:08.64]You'll be fine.
[11:11.94]There you go.
[11:12.44]Good as new.
[11:13.56]Good as new.
[11:16.65]And... Hey, it worked!
[11:21.91]Thanks for the money.
[11:22.73]VIP?
[11:23.83]The mayor of... Crater... What?
[11:28.23]He's dead!
[11:30.78]You just killed your first patient!
[11:32.24]No, it said there was a 72% chance that was... Wait, he's alive.
[11:34.90]No, no, never mind.
[11:38.98]See you later, death.
[11:40.52]That was a 72% chance that it was gonna work.
[11:43.14]I don't want to do that again.
[11:46.27]This is an even less chance.
[11:47.42]What the f- what?
[11:48.06]Alright, hold on.
[11:50.32]Let me get another diagnostic room.
[11:51.52]Let's see if we can, like, make this right.
[11:54.34]Ward.
[11:55.66]Pharmacy.
[11:57.32]Inflation.
[11:58.09]Diagnostic.
[11:58.77]Psychiatric.
[12:00.57]Maybe it's, like, all in their head.
[12:01.57]Hey, we're gonna get a ward up here.
[12:04.15]Because maybe we gotta send these guys to the ward?
[12:07.87]That was ridiculous.
[12:08.60]I can't believe that guy died.
[12:09.66]No, I can't go there.
[12:10.96]Can't go there.
[12:12.75]Where am I gonna put this goddamn... I did really pretty poor planning.
[12:19.03]Um... It's gonna have to go, like, over here.
[12:22.15]Damn it!
[12:22.53]No, that's a terrible spot.
[12:23.61]What about right here?
[12:25.49]It'll be next to the reception desk.
[12:30.02]Holy hell, that's a terrible spot for this.
[12:32.76]Hey, welcome to the hospital!
[12:37.52]Place more benches?
[12:38.52]People are... being forced to stand up!
[12:43.19]What is Mayor McCheese doing?
[12:46.08]Is he like... Oh, shut up.
[12:49.38]Shut up.
[12:51.26]We're good.
[12:52.26]Send the invisible guy over here.
[12:55.04]Let's go... No, no, no.
[12:56.16]I don't want to do that.
[12:58.78]I need another nurse, right?
[13:00.58]I do.
[13:01.94]Oh, there she is.
[13:03.20]But that means the nurse from over here just left.
[13:06.66]Where's the nurse now?
[13:07.48]I'll pay for it.
[13:08.04]I'll pay for it.
[13:08.86]I got the money.
[13:09.38]Why not?
[13:11.93]Need more benches, that's what she said?
[13:13.21]Need a drink machine, too.
[13:15.93]Dr. Pepper.
[13:17.09]Gotta have like a Dr. Pepper machine, like right next to the doctor's office.
[13:20.84]Look at how popular this thing are.
[13:23.24]$20?!
[13:24.66]Did you just see how much money that was?
[13:27.08]That was 20 bucks for a Coke.
[13:30.46]20 bucks.
[13:32.21]I don't know what kind of weird, screwed up dimension these people are living in, where a soda is $20.
[13:39.58]I'm a bad man for running this kind of organization.
[13:44.72]Get out of here.
[13:47.22]Okay.
[13:48.24]Hall of Shame?
[13:52.25]Did I just lose the game?
[13:53.61]I... Did I... Did I lose the game?
[14:03.99]What?
[14:05.69]I would absolutely take that.
[14:06.48]Thank you so much.
[14:25.07]I did it.
[14:25.99]I beat the level.
[14:27.01]What do you know about that?
[14:28.53]But anyways, guys, that's probably going to wrap up this episode.
[14:31.38]If you want to see more Theme Hospital, I mean, I'm not sure how much of a series I'm going to do with this because it's pretty self-explanatory, but it's a very, very fun game.
[14:38.58]Live Enlightened today, if you enjoyed it, then let me know.
[14:41.98]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[14:43.49]Take care, everybody.
[14:44.53]See you all soon.
[14:45.37]Inject the needle in his face.
[14:49.88]you
