[00:09.08]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:11.05]Jermock here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.95]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Spy with the default invisibility watch, the Ambassador, and the Spicycle.
[00:24.20]This is on King of the Hill Lakeside, and I get a bunch of kills.
[00:28.26]I think I top-fragged two, I'm not exactly sure, but... This video is not gonna be really about the gameplay.
[00:33.45]I wanna talk to you guys because it is finals season.
[00:37.57]Beginning of May, end of May, between the May to May is when a lot of you guys are taking your finals.
[00:42.30]A lot of you guys are getting into study zone, where you have to really pay attention in class.
[00:47.14]And I figured I'd make this video to try and give you some of my experiences, some of my tips to help you cool off, I guess, during the stressful time.
[00:56.12]And do you like that pun I just made?
[00:57.78]Spicycle cooling off?
[00:59.02]I know, I'm terrible.
[01:00.16]But, here we go.
[01:01.82]Here is Germa's epic test getting ready for strats.
[01:07.17]That was in quotes, by the way.
[01:08.81]So...
[01:09.77]Number one, the number one most important thing you need to remember is do not stress yourself out.
[01:15.11]This is the most important thing about finals weeks.
[01:18.31]Do not get into that mode where you're like, oh, how many questions are going to be on the test?
[01:22.83]How many answers am I going to get?
[01:23.80]Am I going to be able to know every single answer?
[01:25.48]Do not get into that mode.
[01:27.40]The best way to study for a test
[01:30.32]is not to stay up till nine in the morning overnight studying and then go into the class the next day and sit down and have no sleep.
[01:38.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[01:39.47]The best way to do this, guys, is get as much sleep as possible.
[01:44.17]You want seven to eight hours at least of sleep to get your brain ready to go for the next day.
[01:50.44]And for studying and cramming wise,
[01:52.58]Don't do the majority of your studying the night before an exam.
[01:57.06]Do it in spurts.
[01:58.54]Do it in a relaxed setting.
[02:00.07]Have a little bit of music behind you somewhere over the week period that you're supposed to be studying.
[02:04.57]Never get into that mode where you're like, Joe, my dear, okay, this question answer, got it, got it, got it.
[02:10.15]Your brain can't handle it.
[02:11.67]And you'll end up forgetting a lot of the information that was supposed to be stored to begin with.
[02:15.97]So do it in spurts.
[02:17.19]Do it in a relaxed setting.
[02:18.55]Just sit there, get a cup of tea or a cup of cocoa or something.
[02:22.27]Read for an hour.
[02:24.03]Get some of the information in your head.
[02:25.35]Go watch some TV.
[02:26.27]Relax.
[02:27.17]Get it stored into long-term memory.
[02:30.13]That is the big thing.
[02:31.59]Long-term versus short-term, guys.
[02:33.56]That's how you remember information.
[02:35.22]It gets stored into the long-term.
[02:37.55]Epic strategy number two is on test day.
[02:41.07]When you're actually taking the test, you're actually sitting down in the seat and you're answering questions.
[02:46.16]So you get to question one, you say, okay, I know that question.
[02:48.12]I got that one right.
[02:49.06]Question two, know that one too.
[02:50.64]Question three, you have no idea.
[02:53.90]Skip that question and move on to the next one.
[02:57.04]And at the very end, go back to it.
[02:59.58]Don't sit there for 45 minutes with your hand in your head going, I don't know these next two questions.
[03:05.41]Hold on, let me try and remember.
[03:06.41]Let me sit back and really try and pull it out of my brain.
[03:09.21]Because when you do that, you're kind of screwing up your rhythm and you're kind of messing up the way that you're going to take the test.
[03:15.08]So just skip those questions and get on to number five or number six.
[03:18.92]And you go, oh, I know these answers.
[03:20.70]Get every answer you know before going back and trying to find and pull out the information from the ones you didn't.
[03:26.98]It is really important for your cognitive brain to be in a rhythm rather than to just sit there with your pencil in your mouth going, do you know what?
[03:36.13]Now that does not mean to blow through the test as fast as you can.
[03:38.99]No, that just means keep your brain active and keep a good pace.
[03:42.77]You don't want to blow through a test that is not, you don't want to go as fast as you can.
[03:45.61]Do not do that.
[03:47.34]So the third and the final tip I'm going to give you is as important as the first one, and pretty much what it comes down to is eat a very good breakfast the day of a test.
[03:58.81]And that does not mean don't walk out the door with a bagel in your mouth, chewing on it, and then you throw half the damn thing out the window on the ride to school.
[04:06.79]You need to eat a good, balanced breakfast, have a full glass of orange juice, have a good, like, scrambled eggs and bacon and toast and...
[04:14.56]everything.
[04:15.24]Fill your body.
[04:16.38]Don't overeat, but just get a very good quality breakfast in your system.
[04:21.02]That will keep you active.
[04:22.70]That'll keep your brain fed.
[04:24.34]Your brain will not be hungry during the test and you will see better results.
[04:30.55]So that is going to wrap up this video, guys.
[04:33.23]Hopefully you got something out of this.
[04:34.57]These are the things that I used to do, and they did seem to work.
[04:37.19]I mean, I wasn't the best student in college.
[04:38.69]I didn't have, like, a 4.0 grade average or something.
[04:41.20]But it did help.
[04:42.86]So keep this all in mind, guys, and good luck to everybody on your finals.
[04:47.66]Hope you all ace them.
[04:48.70]Hope you all get A+.
[04:50.85]Don't stress.
[04:51.57]Don't overdo it.
[04:52.51]Just keep relaxed.
[04:53.49]Keep happy and all that good stuff, everybody.
[04:56.57]So I'll see you guys all soon.
[04:58.29]And take care, everybody.
