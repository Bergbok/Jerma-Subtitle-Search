[00:13.75]Hey, what's going on guys?
[00:15.00]Jerma here with One in the Chamber, just said the name of the game mode.
[00:18.58]This is going to be a live commentary of me messing around on One in the Chamber, which, if you don't know what this is, well, this is Call of Duty Black Ops 2, where...
[00:27.86]You only get one bullet, kind of like the golden gun in 007.
[00:33.30]One shot kill.
[00:34.10]If you kill somebody, you get your bullet back.
[00:37.72]And you get three lives.
[00:40.40]So, let's... Nope!
[00:43.28]Come here, you son of a bitch!
[00:45.67]You can also knife people as well.
[00:47.31]As you just... Damn it!

[02:38.30]Oh, I saw that guy.
[02:40.75]If I was a split second earlier.
[02:42.93]It's alright.
[02:43.43]That's only one death.
[02:44.35]That's only one death.

[03:42.64]Where is this asshole?
[03:45.28]Oh, there he is.
[03:45.76]There he is.
[03:46.36]He doesn't have a shot.
[03:46.96]I don't think he has a shot.
[03:48.56]Can I end it right here?
[03:50.18]Can I end it right here?
[03:50.84]That's the question.
[03:51.38]That's the real question at hand.
[03:52.40]He's coming around.
[03:52.88]He's coming around.
[03:56.48]Oh, no.
[03:56.76]He's coming back.
[03:57.32]He's coming back.
[03:57.88]Oh, this is so scary.
[04:01.04]No!
[04:01.80]He missed.
[04:05.34]Yeah!
[04:06.63]Oh!
[04:08.03]Oh, I forgot my name was Murder, She Wrote.
[04:10.77]If anybody knows what that is, Murder, She Wrote was an old TV show in the 80s.
[04:15.92]My grandmother used to watch it.
[04:18.26]Oh, look at this knife right there.
[04:19.30]Look at this.
[04:19.92]Oh, sidestep!
[04:23.58]Apparently I knifed his back.
[04:26.37]Or, I don't even know what I just knifed.
[04:27.93]That was weird.
[04:29.49]Alright, one more.
[04:30.15]One more run.
[04:30.61]Let's do it.
[04:31.57]One more time.
[04:33.31]Alright, let's do a repeat of last time.
[04:35.12]Let me get top-fragged like a boss.
[04:39.08]Five, four, three, two, one, go.
[04:44.21]Let's go up top.
[04:45.15]Get in here.
[04:52.21]Anybody?
[04:52.59]Anybody?
[04:54.31]Anybody?
[04:55.95]What does that noise even mean?
[04:57.37]That thing scares the... What?
[05:00.53]What?
[05:02.35]That didn't make any sense at all.
[05:04.23]I knifed that guy right in his teeth.
[05:07.04]Oh, we got a guy coming up right here.
[05:10.74]What?
[05:11.14]No!
[05:11.40]That's not fair!
[05:12.08]It's not fair!
[05:12.56]It's not fair!
[05:14.10]I shot that guy in his wrist.
[05:15.14]This guy...
[05:26.44]I got him.
[05:27.14]How did I get that guy?
[05:28.12]Holy God.
[05:29.04]I didn't even, I didn't even like hit that guy.
[05:30.40]I shot like 10 feet to that guy's right.
[05:32.88]Oh, behind me.
[05:33.82]I'm on my last life here.
[05:38.18]I gotta be real careful.
[05:39.74]This is, can't screw around.
[05:48.25]Up top this way.
[05:51.08]Watch that UAV.
[05:51.82]There's a guy right here.
[05:54.14]See ya.
[05:57.42]Anybody else?
[05:58.96]Check that UAV.
[06:03.50]Yo!
[06:06.80]Oh, I air-knifed him.
[06:09.40]One guy over here as well.
[06:13.13]Come here, you.
[06:14.81]Come here, you.
[06:18.19]He doesn't know where I am.
[06:22.06]Ready?
[06:22.24]Watch this.
[06:22.80]Super knife!
[06:25.35]Oh, it's all about the knife.
[06:26.21]It's all about the knife.
[06:27.71]Oh, I would have won it.
[06:31.22]I would have won it right there.
[06:32.84]Damn.
[06:34.56]Oh, well, well.
[06:36.22]This mode is a lot of fun.
[06:37.22]If you don't know how to do this, if you have Black Ops 2, you go to Party Games.
[06:41.71]And that was me that died right there, by the way.
[06:44.01]You go to Party Games, and it's one in the chamber.
[06:46.95]So, thank you guys so much for watching.
[06:48.29]Really do appreciate it.
[06:49.57]And I'll see you guys all soon.
[06:50.77]And, of course, take care, everybody.
[06:53.29]Murder, she wrote.
