[00:04.14]Alright.
[00:07.90]I hope I don't have to have... Do I have to have a 6-axis controller to play this?
[00:18.95]I might actually need that.
[00:20.81]Uh-oh.
[00:29.00]Okay, hold on.
[00:31.34]Thank you, Edgebow, for the $1.
[00:32.21]Hey, Jeremy, I've been a fan for a long time and I've been binge-watching your streams.
[00:37.95]Just wanted to get back at you for all the times you've made me laugh all these years.
[00:41.85]Well, thank you, Calfat.
[00:44.43]Cap hat.
[00:45.59]Cap hat.
[00:47.25]Appreciate it, Cap.
[00:48.59]Thank you for the $1.
[00:50.83]Edgebow, thanks for the $1.
[00:51.93]I just combined two bits in a row.
[00:54.01]I guess my brain turned off.
[00:56.21]I was binge-washing you.
[00:58.83]Highfire, thank you for the $1 as well.
[01:00.67]You say ads?
[01:02.54]No?
[01:02.84]Appreciate it.
[01:04.96]Alright.
[01:05.60]How... What is this?
[01:13.83]Alright, well, just so you guys know, the remainder of the stream is going to be... Is going to be copyright claimed.
[01:24.02]Considering... It's all copyrighted music.
[01:27.98]Should I turn off the music?
[01:30.66]I probably... Hey, VOD watchers, see you next time!
[01:36.42]What's the suspect, Lisa?
[01:37.96]What'd I do?
[01:40.00]What the hell did I do?
[01:43.12]What happened?
[01:43.58]I pressed, like, two buttons, and now the game crashed.
[01:50.30]Uh... What?
[01:53.35]Okay, well, hold on.
[01:55.25]That was odd.
[01:58.19]We're gonna try that again.
[02:09.51]Can I- is it- can I play this game?
[02:13.14]VOD saved.
[02:16.57]Holy shit, my PS4, my PS3 is hard locked right now.
[02:19.63]I have to, like, unplug the back.
[02:25.47]Jesus.
[02:27.73]Did we just witness my PS3 die on stream?
[02:29.95]We may have.
[02:31.51]The button's just blinking.
[02:34.15]Okay.
[02:35.49]What do I do here?
[02:39.33]Oh, God.
[02:39.83]What the fuck does that mean?
[02:40.53]What does that mean?
[02:46.72]Isaac got like triple beeped.
[02:47.67]What the fuck was that?
[03:01.52]Bricked PS3.
[03:06.20]No, it's good.
[03:07.22]Here we are.
[03:07.66]We're good.
[03:12.61]It's not yellow.
[03:14.41]We don't have a death ring.
[03:15.77]Let me try this again.
[03:21.06]Time to play Spore.
[03:22.78]Absolutely not.
[03:23.44]I'm not going to play Spore.
[03:27.20]That would actually have been pretty funny if the game bricked my PS3 at the very last game on the list.
[03:35.19]How many were there?
[03:35.77]30?
[03:35.79]40?
[03:35.95]Something like that?
[03:48.02]Spore, spore, no.
[03:49.02]I'm not gonna play spore.
[04:01.91]Triple beep memes your food.
[04:03.25]Triple beep memes?
[04:04.29]Why am I not able to talk right now?
[04:08.00]Oh, you know, memes.
[04:10.26]When a triple, when you get triple memes...
[04:17.74]Alright.
[04:21.47]Fuck, is it really fucked up?
[04:22.41]Alright.
[04:30.27]I think it worked.
[04:30.73]So who do I want to be?
[04:35.88]I could be Ludicrous Method Man.
[04:41.08]I think I want to be Ludicrous.
[04:43.76]Is it weird that I don't know a lot of these guys?
[04:45.64]I know some of them.

[04:51.12]Alright, Ludacris.

[05:00.90]There we go.
[05:01.32]Ludacris versus, uh... I don't know.
[05:04.52]How about, like... Little John's the guy that says, yeah, right?
[05:07.72]And then okay after it.
[05:10.46]Okay, we're gonna do Ludacris versus Little John.
[05:14.63]Sounds good.

[05:52.33]Alright.
[05:52.65]Alright, here comes, here comes, here comes, we're gonna, alright, here we go.

[24:49.50]The world is ending.
[24:54.68]Yeah, it's doing the opening credits to Six Feet Under on HBO.
[25:00.88]God fucking dammit.
[25:02.92]I ain't gonna lose this.
[25:05.90]Completely unnecessary, but it actually worked.
[25:12.58]We can figure out a couple of combos with this character.
[25:16.93]I do like when you explode, it's a lot of fun.
[25:21.51]I'm just getting waved at.
[25:22.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[25:46.86]I'm gonna do my force move with this dude.
[25:49.80]No, no, it's gonna... Get just bounced around like a fucking pinball.
[25:54.31]That happened to me like seven times.
[25:58.07]Oh...

[26:21.10]Alright, one more.
[26:23.72]One more.

[26:26.67]First, let me start a new character.
[26:30.23]I'm gonna make me.
[26:32.51]What's my rap name?
[26:35.51]I have to make my character.

[27:18.20]I understand.
[27:18.80]Alright, let's go.
[27:20.76]Let's go active.
[27:22.30]What is this?
[27:25.68]Holy shit, this is like a pretty elaborate character creator.
[27:28.52]This doesn't look like me, okay?
[27:30.74]It actually kind of does.
[27:53.57]This is not me.
[27:55.44]Oh well.
[28:37.74]Twins!
[28:38.64]We're fucking twins!
[28:42.33]Can you tell the difference?
[28:43.15]Who's the game character?

[29:43.27]How do, there's a lot of facial hair apparently.
[29:45.19]How do I, there's so many of these.
[29:50.14]Alright, none.
[29:53.64]Alright, it's too, I can't take it off.
[29:55.84]Apparently, alright, it's off.
[30:16.08]I kinda like this beat.
[30:17.82]Alright, uh, info.

[31:35.03]Looks like I'm doing this one.
[31:40.11]So what happens now?
[31:48.47]985 as the last name.
[31:49.48]I don't know.
[31:49.76]What is it loading?
[31:58.12]The VOD is absolutely muted.
[32:06.79]Record my own song?
[32:10.47]No, alright, so I'll do my own song.
[32:12.89]Ain't that some shit?
[32:15.31]OK, yeah.

[32:20.61]You drive past a police car, you turn down your radio.
[32:23.50]Don't we all?
[32:23.86]Do I have this open world or something?
[32:24.82]For real, when has hip hop not been the target of fear and suspicion?
[32:28.32]Let me hear what you think.

[33:18.97]I'm gonna turn the music off then.
[33:20.07]Wow, thanks, Mr. Carver.
[33:20.89]How do I turn the music off in the game?
[33:23.31]Oh, my character looks like a freak.

[34:14.06]We just got the ending.
[34:16.54]So now I have to fight somebody here.
[34:23.20]My guy looks like a ventriloquist's dummy.
[34:33.07]A fucking ventriloquist dummy.
[34:35.17]I'm gonna like turn around.
[34:37.75]I'm gonna have like... Oh my god, what the fuck?

[35:57.83]Here we go.
[35:59.13]It's gonna be probably a little loud, but that's okay.
[36:10.74]One sec.
[36:12.84]This is if you like, like if I got like surrounded by, like people and it was just like, Oh, this guy's fucking urine deep shit.
[36:20.06]You know what's on my Walkman?
[36:21.80]This.
[36:27.88]I had to unplug something here.

[38:52.04]Oh my god.
[38:53.90]Alright, that's it.
[38:55.00]It's over.
[38:55.98]I didn't win before the fight was done.
[38:58.25]That means I lose.
[39:03.29]Turn HUD on.
[39:04.17]Oh.
[39:09.53]Turn the HUD on.
[39:14.17]Who wins?
[39:16.59]Oh.
[39:17.27]I'm losing.
[39:18.69]I'm losing by a fairly significant amount.
[39:23.72]That was no audio.
[39:25.00]Just me talking.
[39:25.72]That would've been a pretty cool kick.
[39:34.07]Yeah.
[39:35.47]Cool, huh?
[39:37.03]This guy's not gonna get to play his song.
[39:38.65]We only get my song.
