[00:08.95]Hello?
[00:21.28]Can you hear me?
[00:23.10]Can you all hear me?
[00:24.67]Interesting.
[00:25.29]I don't know why that was happening.
[00:27.77]A little too loud.
[00:29.91]There we go.
[00:31.77]Hey, that's better.
[00:32.71]At least slightly.
[00:33.29]Maybe I'll change it in a minute.
[00:36.60]Don't ask me what's up with that.
[00:38.66]That's been happening a little more frequently than I would like.
[00:42.98]But hi, good evening.
[00:44.18]Hello, everybody.
[00:46.56]Give me just a minute.
[00:48.20]Wait, what?
[00:49.44]I need to redo this one.
[00:52.61]Alright, I'm setting up some more VR.
[00:54.57]This time, hopefully, it doesn't cause me and my brain to explode.
[00:59.87]It would be nice if it didn't do that.
[01:01.83]I'll be right back, starting soon.
[01:02.95]See you in a minute.
[01:41.03]Wait, what?
[03:05.54]Wait, what?
[03:15.12]Beer.
[04:05.45]Oh, hi.
[04:06.71]I don't know.
[04:08.07]Why am I doing that?
[04:08.85]I shouldn't be doing that to you guys.
[04:12.21]Alright, I'm going to play I Expect You to Die.
[04:14.79]Actually, we're going to start with Job Simulator.
[04:16.27]I feel like that would be easier, more fun, right?
[04:19.36]Let me just switch the title.
[04:21.22]Hold on.
[04:36.09]Alright.
[04:48.12]I don't even know if this camera's plugged in.
[04:52.98]It should be.
[04:55.02]Let's see.
[05:02.15]Are we here?
[05:02.75]Hey, look.
[05:04.79]We are here.
[05:09.10]And look, the virtual reality is ready to go too!
[05:14.22]Isn't that fucking something special?
[05:17.82]Alright, wait, wait, wait, disconnect it.
[05:19.27]Yeah, I feel like that's like the funny game to play, right?
[05:27.65]Holy shit, what's with the bits?
[05:28.91]What's going on here?
[05:30.70]Oh my god, what the fuck just happened?
[05:33.88]I'm like, uh... Oh, boy.
[05:38.24]Hold on a second.
[05:39.60]Hold on a second.
[05:40.38]Wait a minute.
[05:40.92]Wait a minute.
[05:42.25]Somebody just dropped fucking money.
[05:47.21]Who gave that much money?
[05:49.01]Okay, well, first of all, my Twitch alerts is fucked up.
[05:51.83]So, somebody just gave 15 bucks.
[05:53.81]I don't know who you were, but thanks.
[05:55.09]That's fucking much appreciated.
[05:57.74]Somebody gave 100 bucks.
[05:58.94]Somebody gave 100 bucks.
[05:59.48]What?
[06:01.72]Twice.
[06:02.66]Ruby, did you give a hundred bucks two fucking times?
[06:07.51]He says A, and then he says 1500 high.
[06:09.93]Cheer 1500 high, Kevin.
[06:15.63]Was it Ruby twice?
[06:16.71]Holy shit, and then Sam gave two bucks too.
[06:20.35]Like, dude, did you guys see last night's stream?
[06:23.29]It was fucking terrible.
[06:25.50]Last night's stream was awful.
[06:27.62]And I just made $225.
[06:28.20]What?
[06:35.27]I got nothing to say.
[06:36.08]That's fucking incredibly generous of you guys.
[06:39.32]It was me once, daddy.
[06:40.96]Well, Mittens.
[06:42.40]Holy shit, dude.
[06:46.09]Mittens, you are on a fucking roll.
[06:49.41]Alright, well, hopefully this stream's fun.
[06:51.03]I hope you guys laugh at this stream.
[06:53.90]Hope we have a good time tonight.
[06:56.97]I have my guardian back here.
[07:00.23]Is it doing anything bad or wrong?
[07:03.64]She comes over and she gives me a little smack rule on the head.
[07:06.68]Hi, guys.
[07:07.04]I'm Kim.
[07:10.14]Yeah, she came down here.
[07:11.30]She's like, it's fucking cold down here.
[07:12.78]It's like, yeah, it's freezing down here.
[07:14.91]It's because it's just the way it is.
[07:18.02]What are you actually playing?
[07:19.25]I wasn't listening to you all.
[07:21.03]It's this one over here.
[07:22.65]I expect you to die.
[07:24.05]Yeah, it's over here.
[07:26.57]Why is this running like shit?
[07:29.11]You guys notice that?
[07:30.43]Did you do a speed test?
[07:32.87]No, it's over here.
[07:33.89]I'm going to play Job Simulator.
[07:36.54]If I can even get it over here.
[07:38.22]Okay.
[07:39.78]Alright.
[07:40.71]Uh, I expect you to die is gonna close.
[07:42.05]That's fine.
[07:43.27]Who cares?
[07:44.43]Uh, hi guys.
[07:45.11]I'm modding his room from right behind him.
[07:47.71]She's gonna be, like, you guys get, like, moderated in the chat.
[07:50.19]Like, I get moderated in real life here.
[07:54.33]She's, she's like the real life moderator.
[07:58.07]So if I say to... I let you do whatever you want.
[08:00.18]Yeah.
[08:01.32]Well, you took my, you took my beanie last night.
[08:03.06]That's for damn sure.
[08:03.74]That's because you look fucking stupid.
[08:05.14]Wait, what?
[08:07.46]Now I have to pee.
[08:09.90]Okay, let me pee.
[08:12.45]I swear to God, like, I'm never prepared, ever.
[08:15.99]I think I'm prepared, and then, you know, you never know when urine's gonna come out, grab it, you know?
[08:20.67]What's going on?
[08:21.39]What am I doing?
[08:24.37]It's not fit for your head.
[08:25.91]Yeah, it's because you have a tiny head.
[08:28.43]You're talking about my tiny head?
[08:29.37]You're talking about my tiny head?
[08:31.19]I got such a tiny head, you can't even hit me.
[08:34.93]Oh, by the way, I was gonna play TF2.
[08:36.59]Oh, you have to stand over here, by the way.
[08:39.91]What am I going to have to stand over there?
[08:41.07]Because it's... Well, the VR helmet is showing me that you have to, like, stand over here.
[08:44.79]Oh, what the fuck?
[08:45.75]More of this nonsense?
[08:46.61]Alright, let me pee.
[08:47.31]I'll be back.
[08:47.81]I'm sorry.
[08:48.37]I gotta piss.
[08:48.95]Bad.
[08:49.25]I'll be right back.
[10:44.80]Alright.
[11:02.81]You do stupid shit in front of me all the time.
[11:05.11]Why do you, like... I do do stupid shit in front of you.
[11:07.41]Okay, take the tea break off.
[11:08.53]Let's put this back on.
[11:10.27]Alright, let's get in here.
[11:13.95]Let me put these headphones in.
[11:19.90]But anyways, like, honest to God, seriously, like... Wait, what?
[11:23.60]You guys dropping that fucking money?
[11:25.08]Like, that's... I never know what to say.
[11:28.44]Honest to God.
[11:30.22]But seeing the fact that somebody would do that just blows my fucking mind every time.
[11:33.76]Alright.
[11:36.66]If this wasn't all tangled... Oh, let's talk about Sony's cords again.
[11:39.21]Look at how tangled up this is.
[11:40.21]That's your fault.
[11:43.73]No, it is, but... It's your fault.
[11:46.19]Fucking Sony Online Entertainment with their cords.
[11:48.39]Look at this cord.
[11:48.95]What does it look like?
[11:49.83]Is it a pretzel?
[11:50.97]Get out of here.
[11:54.45]Excuse me.
[11:55.39]You're supposed to laugh at my jokes.
[11:57.33]No, you're not funny.
[12:00.25]You're supposed to laugh at my jokes.
[12:01.71]You're not funny.
[12:02.45]Why should I laugh?
[12:07.16]You know, sometimes... Sometimes you gotta be funny.
[12:16.70]What the fuck was that?
[12:20.34]Was that in this room or was that in the game?
[12:24.91]Nothing was going on in here.
[12:26.25]Okay, that was fucking weird.
[12:27.13]Alright.
[12:30.77]That just scared the shit out of me.
[12:34.01]Alright.
[12:35.62]So I need to back up.
[12:38.34]Would you give me these?
[12:39.04]You have to back up to over here.
[12:41.58]Oh, okay.
[12:42.26]That is in there.
[12:44.08]It's just freaking me the fuck out for a second.
[12:46.20]So, in the VR helmet, when I put it on, the rings of light showed the footsteps to be right about here.
[12:55.36]Even further back?
[12:56.24]Yeah.
[12:56.58]So, like, you need to stand up.
[12:58.84]No, I'm not going to stand up.
[13:00.96]Untangle that.
[13:01.82]That's good.
[13:02.18]It's like right here.
[13:05.75]VR is too real.
[13:07.13]Okay.
[13:08.25]Try pushing back just a little more.
[13:09.73]So, I just adjusted your...
[13:14.37]Yeah, this will work, like, right here.
[13:17.92]Like this.
[13:19.62]You just adjust this, so just in case you need to get more.
[13:24.82]What's this thing, like, dancing in front of me for?
[13:26.62]Okay.
[13:27.50]Stand.
[13:27.86]It does want me to stand, doesn't it?
[13:29.36]Oh, goodness.
[13:30.12]I told you.
[13:30.76]I told you.
[13:31.51]Wait, what?
[13:34.31]No, it's okay.
[13:36.03]It, like, knows I'm in there now.
[13:47.62]Let's just pretend I'm standing.
[14:00.41]I don't know.
[14:00.81]Why is it not registering this one?
[14:03.05]Probably because it's dead.
[14:03.83]Yeah, it's been plugged in.
[14:05.53]It says don't.
[14:10.16]Why is it... Did I just, like, die?
[14:12.00]Okay.
[14:16.70]Okay.
[14:19.23]Did my motion... Yeah, it means it's on.
[14:22.94]I think my second motion controller just freaked the fuck out.
[14:26.12]It's on the screen freaking out.
[14:28.70]No, it's not.
[14:29.38]Yeah, ready to watch.
[14:30.04]Look at this.
[14:31.44]You'll see it dancing around.
[14:33.82]Hand it to me.
[14:35.26]No.
[14:36.46]Say please.
[14:37.70]Hand it to me, god damn it, please.
[14:41.94]And thank you.
[14:42.42]You're welcome.
[14:45.08]Do you see it up there?
[14:47.95]What, like, why is it doing that?
[14:50.63]I want to, like, grab... Hold on, let me... Are we already starting with, like, it being all fucked up already?
[14:56.45]Well, maybe if you just ask nicely, it would come back.
[15:00.39]Let's... Yeah.
[15:04.02]You know, part of me is about to just freak the fuck out and just play Fistful of Frags, like, right now.
[15:10.42]Like, honest to God.
[15:17.38]It's just like dead.
[15:18.32]What did I do that was so wrong?
[15:21.74]Let me hold the options button.
[15:27.41]Right?
[15:27.91]I mean.
[15:28.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:29.59]I have an idea.
[15:30.59]Oh my fucking God.
[15:33.59]Give it a couple of whacks.
[15:38.58]Let me see.
[15:40.55]Alright, like, I really, like, can't believe we're doing this two nights in a row with these fucking motion controllers.
[15:46.49]That's the variable each night.
[15:47.93]The two nights in a row that the stream has been, like, shitty, it's because these fucking... Wait, wait, wait, where's the... I'll be right back.
[16:16.93]Yeah.
[18:16.99]Yeah, I'm gonna set up something else.
[18:27.94]This is just like... I ain't doing another disaster stream two days in a row because of the move controllers.
[18:32.81]No fucking way.
[18:34.75]Give me like five minutes.
[18:36.05]I'm gonna set up something else.
[20:09.32]Okay.
[20:11.31]I'm gonna give this one last try.
[20:13.15]Okay, now it actually knows that it exists.
[20:17.07]Alright, here we go.
[20:17.91]We're gonna try this again.
[20:18.73]And by the way, if this gets to a point where I'm noticing it's a disaster stream... You know what I'm saying?
[20:28.08]Like, if this gets to a point where I... Look, now it's not in outer space anymore.
[20:31.90]Wait, what?
[20:32.56]They're both here.
[20:34.67]But like I said, dude, this gets to a point where it's a disaster stream.
[20:38.85]Oh, I'm fucking playing something else.
[20:41.91]I gotta let that go on like it did yesterday.
[20:45.42]No fucking way.
[20:48.58]PlayStation VR.
[20:51.22]More like, please vacuum my rectum.
[20:56.21]PSVR.
[20:56.97]More like it, you know what I'm saying?

[26:27.89]Does that make sense?
[26:29.91]No.
[26:31.69]Okay, maybe that does make sense.
[26:33.21]Alright, let's just go for it.
[26:37.39]Is my fly up?
[26:39.37]It's up, right?
[26:41.29]Yeah.
[26:43.71]You're fine.
[26:44.19]Okay, good.
[26:47.64]There we go.
[26:49.06]There we go.
[26:50.31]Now I'm at least tall enough to see what... Just give me a job, please.
[26:55.95]This is like, this is too far away.
[26:59.99]I really am like fucking three feet tall.
[27:02.56]Why?
[27:02.86]I'm not going to be able to do this shit.
[27:15.40]It doesn't matter.
[27:16.16]Oh my god.
[27:19.80]Hit what button?
[27:26.90]Oh, okay.
[27:30.98]As long as everything I need to do is like right here.
[27:33.76]Look, I can even step forward.
[27:34.78]Fuck what this game tells me.
[27:37.43]Can they hear me?
[27:38.95]Can you guys hear us?
[27:40.45]Press 3.
[27:46.32]This is not how this is supposed to look.
[27:51.61]I am certain of this.
[27:57.79]I'm just a baby.
[27:58.89]I'm just a baby.
[28:00.35]Hello?
[28:01.25]Where's your mommy?
[28:02.81]I'm not supposed to be this close.
[28:10.54]And I can't back up.
[28:13.00]Wait, do you want me to try to pull everything out again?
[28:15.32]No, no, no.
[28:16.82]I can push the computer back a little bit.
[28:18.82]It can't go that far, though.
[28:22.02]What's going on here now?
[28:23.06]What's this?
[28:24.63]It's like a metal thing.
[28:25.49]Alright, hold on, guys.
[28:26.49]Let me ask a question.
[28:29.33]Can I ask a question to people in the chat that might be watching right now?
[28:33.75]How do I reset where I'm supposed to be standing?
[28:38.03]You know what I mean?
[28:42.13]Like, lower the floor?
[28:43.19]Like, is that what I'm just... Lower the floor or shitload?
[28:47.23]What?
[28:48.31]Oh, I'm gonna... Maybe that will do it.
[28:51.68]Just burn the PSVR.
[28:54.74]I'm gonna turn it up a little bit.
[28:56.92]You can just take the PSVR to my house.
[28:58.70]I can't?
[29:00.34]I have to lower the floor?
[29:01.32]Alright, I'm gonna lower the floor.
[29:02.38]It's just like... Oh, God!
[29:09.80]I am so sorry, guys, that you just had to see that.
[29:12.83]What'd they have to see?
[29:13.91]Just something awful on the screen.
[29:15.51]Okay.
[29:17.27]I want to recalibrate.
[29:20.29]Uh, select?
[29:21.97]No, just give me back to this shit.
[29:23.75]I can just do it from here, I think.
[29:25.14]Yeah.
[29:26.76]Eat my s- Did you just eat a burrito?
[29:31.24]Yeah, I ate an exit game burrito.
[29:36.76]Like, what the fuck?
[29:39.33]Hello, human.
[29:40.43]Welcome to the job simulator.
[29:42.49]My name is job.
[29:43.57]Alright.
[29:48.18]Bring them into tracking.
[29:49.84]I'm going to lower the floor a ton.
[29:54.90]Okay.
[29:55.42]Stand in the circle.
[29:57.34]Even if I was standing in this circle, like right here, right?
[30:01.75]I'm just barely not pulling this thing off the shelf.
[30:07.95]Like, just barely, this thing is not being pulled off.
[30:12.23]Okay, just floor.
[30:14.55]So you gotta stay and lower the floor.
[30:22.64]Like that, right?
[30:23.34]That makes sense?
[30:26.48]That makes a little bit more sense, right?
[30:29.50]Let's do that.
[30:29.96]Let's try it.
[30:36.66]Okay.
[30:37.82]Let's try this again.
[30:38.90]Now I'm like... Now I'm like 20 feet tall.
[30:48.13]Now I'm fucking huge.
[30:48.87]I'm fucking huge.
[31:03.28]Job simulator I can't even reach down to get this by the way Alright, well you know what at least those of you watching right now can see do not buy this Don't buy a psvr there you go humans only
[31:32.95]like the amount of how strange this is to have to like be in that spot is like fucking mind-boggling to me right now oh never mind I want to hold I wish I could hold it up so you can see but it just don't it just don't make much sense well my hand just drifted away into like the you know maybe if you see it you know it's just too tall alright let me we gotta I gotta recalibrate this again
[32:03.49]This is the best entertainment.
[32:05.07]Hopefully this is funny, at least.
[32:07.11]Because this is enraging.
[32:09.01]This is totally enraging.
[32:12.56]Oh, look.
[32:15.10]Museum curator.
[32:16.06]There's a cute little guy there, but... Alright, hold on.
[32:20.44]I need to reset the game.
[32:22.96]Because... This is just not going to work.
[32:27.34]Wait, I want to be a museum curator.
[32:28.76]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[32:29.32]Let's try this.
[32:29.76]Don't tell me what to do.
[32:30.88]Let me see this.
[32:32.50]I'm going to hold this back here.
[32:34.34]Like, what if I hold this, like, down here or something?
[32:39.76]Can you reach it now?
[32:40.84]If you, like, crouch down?
[32:41.66]Well, I can't see.
[32:43.48]Well, I mean, like, let me see.
[32:50.65]Dude.
[32:52.37]This shit's fucking ridiculous.
[32:55.36]This is the best reaction to PSVR.
[32:58.22]Like, honest to God, PSVR has been great.
[33:01.66]PSVR has been fucking great until you have to actually do the VR.
[33:05.01]Somebody just gave $100.
[33:06.69]Mittens just gave $100 and says, for the love of God, get a 5.
[33:18.49]Wait, why does my hand keep drifting off?
[33:20.29]Like, why is this, like, glitching, like, really hard?
[33:23.00]It's because it's just all fucked up.
[33:24.28]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[33:27.20]Can this game get fucking played without the move?
[33:30.14]It's the move controllers, right?
[33:31.82]PSVR is great unless you have to use these two stupid fucking things.
[33:36.92]Once these two things come into play, it's the biggest piece of shit on the market, right?
[33:42.71]Sitting there with a controller and playing PSVR is fan-fucking-tastic.
[33:46.84]You introduce these two fucking dumb things?
[33:49.38]No way.
[33:50.36]Not a chance.
[33:51.40]I ain't doing that again.
[33:52.66]I can fucking, you got you, I'm you damn sure about that one.
[33:55.23]You know what I'm saying?
[33:59.53]It shouldn't be this difficult to like play a VR game with the move controllers.
[34:02.75]You got, it's been like five hours over two days of this shit.
[34:08.71]Like give me a goddamn break.
[34:16.77]It's just, like, not going in.
[34:17.85]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[34:19.91]What?
[34:20.03]I'm gonna pull you up for a second.
[34:22.19]I'm gonna take, like, direct control with this thing.
[34:24.35]Hey, hey!
[34:25.29]Yeah, I gotta... There's some recalibration that needs to be done.
[34:40.62]Alright, give us a sec.
[34:42.36]Do you remember yesterday?
[34:43.80]You remember yesterday, right?
[34:44.56]No, I fell asleep during your stream.
[34:45.69]Well, no, you remember this shit.
[34:48.45]Oh, yeah, yeah, I did.
[34:49.79]Did you think we were going to be doing this again two days in a row?
[34:51.97]Hey, hey, hey, I was close to putting that little Nintendo 64.
[34:55.89]I was really close.
[35:03.96]One second.
[35:04.76]This is the last time you're going to see the starting soon screen, I promise.
[35:19.19]Wait, what?
[37:09.18]Yeah, alright, so, so, as you guys can very plainly see, I've played PSVR for a total of probably, like, 40 hours, and within the, like, the three or four hours I've had to use the move controllers, I wanted to rip my hair out of my head.
[37:28.30]Like, it's just, it's just not, it's just not built to do this.
[37:36.29]I would like, I'm sorry that these two streams have been, like, not that great.
[37:41.86]It's because I was not fully aware that it was going to be this impossible to use the move controllers with the PSVR.
[37:47.21]So, one more second.
[37:48.23]I'm going to try some more things.
[40:20.07]I'm switching games.
[40:21.47]This shit ain't working.
[40:23.98]I wish I could punt this thing across a football field right now.
[40:27.16]That's how angry I am at the PSVR.
[40:29.94]But I'm going to switch Fistful of Frags and play that for like an hour or two.
[40:34.40]Alright.
[40:34.90]Bye.
[41:04.53]Also, the stream's gonna have to restart.
[41:08.97]So.
[41:10.91]Angry person is gonna, like, restart the stream and come back.
[41:16.06]So.
[41:16.60]Maybe I'll play Binding of Isaac.
[41:18.02]We'll see.
[41:19.64]I am infuriated right now.
[41:22.52]Like, my whole body is on fire.
[41:24.36]Like, I'm, like, heating up.
[41:26.73]That's how fucking angry I am.
[41:29.15]Do I look like I'm, like, on fire right now?
[41:36.96]I'll be right back.
[41:38.27]Hey, just pretend like this stream never fucking happened.
[41:40.53]Alright?
[41:40.83]I'll see you in a minute.
