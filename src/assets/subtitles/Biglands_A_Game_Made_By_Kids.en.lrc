[00:01.90]And in the meantime, I'm going to transition.
[00:03.60]I'm going to move this.
[00:06.51]Put it on the BRB screen because we are not playing that anymore.
[00:10.51]Even though we're here.
[00:13.71]Exit that game.
[00:17.45]Where's late shift?
[00:20.12]No, we're not.
[00:21.24]Late shift.
[00:24.42]I'm not getting... I played late shift way more than I should have.
[00:32.76]way more than I should have.
[00:38.01]So how are we doing?
[00:39.17]How's that poll going?
[00:42.52]Looks like Big Lands, a game made by kids, is currently winning.
[00:50.74]Not by very much though.
[00:51.50]I'm going to let this play out.
[00:52.24]I'm going to let this play out for like another couple of minutes while we just chill.
[00:55.92]And we'll talk about the next couple of weeks.
[00:58.10]So if you're unaware, I bought on Amazon over the last like five or six days or so.
[01:07.97]I purchased about 45 games.
[01:12.83]And these are games that are not on Steam.
[01:14.37]They're not on like good old games.
[01:16.77]These are games that like you can only get boxed copies of at this point.
[01:20.98]at least like more than half of them are so the next couple weeks at least two or three weeks is going to be a bunch of shit that you may not have ever seen before and stuff that's like hard to get unless you buy it on amazon that's going to be the next thing and one of them it's honest there's a bunch of fucking dinosaur games that look insane there's a bunch we're going to do like stealth week as well like afterwards
[01:43.42]There's a bunch of old Western games that look fucking hilarious.
[01:45.80]We're pretty much going to do that.
[01:48.50]The next couple months is going to be completely planned out for what we're doing for streams.
[01:53.25]It's going to be fun.
[01:55.55]But, how are we looking on the poll?
[01:58.55]Big Lands is still winning.
[02:04.15]And then there's also FMV, like Full Motion Video Games Week.
[02:08.85]How much money did I spend?
[02:11.85]Way too much.
[02:15.02]I spent like... I'll tell you, it's more than I should have.
[02:21.41]It was a lot.
[02:24.15]Frog week.
[02:26.29]But it may have been like a lot of money, but it's still... I want to have... Here's the thing.
[02:32.15]Over the last couple weeks, I'm sure you guys have been well aware of streams that were, like, not planned and trying to find a game to play and technical issues and games, like, not working and not being, like, I, that, like, like yesterday.
[02:47.06]That, I don't want that shit to happen anymore.
[02:49.82]I want to be fucking prepared for at least the next few months.
[02:55.15]Now, like a lot of the streams I've done the last week or two have been fun and like some of them have been interesting and I've been enjoying myself immensely.
[03:03.18]But like, fuck that shit.
[03:04.76]I'm not like having a bunch of technical bullshit ruin a stream for an hour.
[03:08.30]It's not going to happen.
[03:10.96]It's not going to happen again.
[03:13.59]But I think the poll, we're going to close it.
[03:15.31]We're going to play Big Lands, a game made by kids for...
[03:21.53]the last 45 minutes.
[03:24.46]And this game is made by kids.
[03:28.28]So poll is closed.
[03:28.98]Thank you for voting.
[03:29.46]That doesn't mean you'll never see those games ever again.
[03:32.56]Don't worry.
[03:32.92]Okay, we're going to name it the stream title.
[03:42.87]Just Big Lands.
[03:44.47]Is this game even on Steam?
[03:46.09]Not Steam.
[03:46.95]I guess it is.
[03:47.31]There it is.
[03:52.73]Okay, I'm just going to write my title.
[03:54.06]A game made by kids.
[03:56.80]There you go.
[04:03.78]Alright.
[04:04.90]Let's open it.
[04:06.26]I'm going to give you a warning here.
[04:07.36]I don't know how loud this is going to be.
[04:09.88]But please bear with me.
[04:10.88]Hopefully it's not too terrible.
[04:13.34]And there's your warning.
[04:14.06]Turn the volume down with your various devices.
[04:16.16]There it is.
[04:16.76]Please.
[04:18.83]Please do that. ...
[04:24.33]I fucking told you guys.
[04:31.66]This is so loud.
[04:33.62]No.
[04:36.90]Oh, hold on.
[04:37.62]I can't even see.
[04:58.72]Well, the game crashed, if you were curious, the game crashed.
[05:02.32]Here it comes again, loud as fuck.
[05:06.38]There it is!
[05:10.48]Piglands!
[05:15.03]Okay.
[05:20.57]It was a peaceful day.
[05:25.47]Until the monsters appeared!
[05:32.39]Oh no!
[05:35.27]This is fucking awesome.
[05:38.19]This is- I need to turn this shit down.
[05:39.89]Look at this, look at this joy.
[05:46.13]It's a kite with hands!
[05:50.99]Oh no, they're coming to the town!
[06:02.89]Oh my god.
[06:04.41]I already love it.
[06:09.73]To move, use W, A, S, D or the arrow keys.
[06:12.47]For game controller support, go to... Paisy.
[06:16.97]Pause other controls.
[06:21.16]Okay.
[06:23.00]Space bars jump.
[06:25.06]Wait a minute.
[06:25.62]Weapons other.
[06:27.06]Other.
[06:27.64]Sound.
[06:29.54]Give feedback.
[06:30.46]Steam.
[06:31.54]Send love.
[06:33.62]There we go.
[06:37.32]Okay.
[06:39.36]That's better.
[06:41.86]Now it's better.
[06:44.82]Controls.
[06:45.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:46.16]Alright, we're good.
[06:48.97]I kind of want to use my controller.
[06:51.81]Can I?
[06:52.63]I kind of want to use the controller.
[06:55.79]I feel like keyboard's going to be a pain in the ass.
[07:00.98]Oh well, we'll just try it like this.
[07:02.10]Alright.
[07:02.42]Wait, what are we doing?
[07:04.56]I'm gonna go talk to this guy.
[07:05.56]Oh, what a terrible day.
[07:08.06]Monsters have come and destroyed our town.
[07:13.83]Game crashed.
[07:20.89]Come on.
[07:21.43]I was just talking about, like, technical bullshit.
[07:28.81]I'm going to play this game, guys.
[07:35.99]And my computer is breaking.
[07:40.66]This just broke my computer.
[07:45.22]Here we go again.
[07:45.92]Here we go again.
[07:53.51]God.
[07:55.11]Yeah, it was a peaceful day.
[07:58.41]Remember this?
[08:02.13]Dude, it's Skyrim.
[08:03.25]Virus kids game.
[08:10.30]Next?
[08:11.02]There is no next tonight.
[08:12.76]This is how we're ending this.
[08:16.86]Game coded by Kit.
[08:18.44]Put it on hard?
[08:29.61]Oh.
[08:29.81]This is a game made for Kit.
[08:38.93]Here we go.
[08:42.17]Let's hope this doesn't happen again.
[08:47.05]Yes, yes.
[08:47.85]Game controller support.
[08:48.67]Go to pause other controllers.
[08:50.07]Yes, sure thing.
[08:55.08]Controller.
[08:56.78]Keyboard and mouse or touch.
[09:02.74]Game controllers.
[09:04.36]Game controller on.
[09:10.46]Got it.
[09:11.02]Alright.
[09:13.33]Let's go.
[09:15.67]Time to play Big Lands.
[09:17.44]Oh, what a terrible day.
[09:18.28]Monsters have come and destroyed our town!
[09:23.63]I've lost everything.
[09:24.57]My friends, my family, and my laboratory are gone.
[09:27.80]We need to do something about this.
[09:28.98]We need to fight back.
[09:30.76]I've been studying these mystical objects.
[09:32.38]It seems that our world has collided with other deadly and monstrous worlds and these are the loopholes between them.
[09:39.92]I need your help.
[09:40.86]You must venture into these unknown worlds and defeat the evil that has destroyed our town.
[09:46.07]Please, will you help me?
[09:47.31]No.
[09:50.10]Huh?
[09:51.18]Well, what else are you going to do?
[09:52.75]Walk around in circles all day?
[09:54.97]Go into the portal and take this dagger with you.
[09:57.17]It's not much, but it's better than nothing.
[09:58.85]Now go and save the world.
[10:02.07]Push right analog to attack.
[10:04.31]Listen to that sick default royalty-free sound.
[10:09.68]Press X to talk.
[10:12.02]Okay.
[10:16.66]This is so... Hold on.
[10:18.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:20.72]Wait.
[10:23.22]Wait.
[10:31.10]Okay.
[10:32.31]That's better.
[10:36.91]It's still so loud.
[10:43.87]Better?
[10:44.11]That's better.
[10:46.00]Okay.
[10:46.60]We're going to the portal.
[10:48.26]Travel to Lava Land.
[10:52.53]lava land travel to level one all right look at this guy oh my god switch times three wire turn the teleport you need a power orb to activate the teleporter
[11:24.20]This is great.
[11:27.38]That guy was just like, hi, welcome to my land, my lava world.
[11:31.76]Oh, shit.
[11:37.42]It's like Isaac.
[11:41.31]Switch, wire, switch.
[11:42.53]Watch out for, like, the weird claymation person.
[11:47.35]You found a power orb.
[11:48.29]These are used to activate teleporters.
[11:51.37]Oh!
[11:52.09]Oh!
[11:56.94]No one needed this game.
[11:59.81]That's true.
[12:00.49]That's very true.
[12:02.29]I can't beat a baby game.
[12:03.31]What are you talking about?
[12:04.87]Use a power orb to activate the teleporter.
[12:06.61]Sure.
[12:08.09]Leave level.
[12:10.15]Whoa, you just appeared from nowhere.
[12:12.78]Did you beat up some monsters?
[12:14.28]Look at that shopkeeper.
[12:15.94]It's Shope.
[12:16.62]Shope.
[12:17.54]Shope.
[12:20.83]Oh, God.
[12:34.90]God, those nasty monsters came and wrecked my shop.
[12:38.00]Now all I've got is this hunk of junk.
[12:40.96]I hope you slay every last one of those beasts.
[12:43.72]I'll tell you what, if you bring me the right materials, I bid you a better weapon to beat those bad guys.
[12:49.38]I'll also be able to rebuild the town if you bring me enough stuff.
[12:52.38]Have a look at what I can do.
[12:54.76]I can make weapons.
[12:56.88]I can make very short.
[12:59.36]Yes.
[13:00.78]Oh.
[13:03.24]I upgraded my dagger.
[13:12.75]Cool.
[13:14.33]Scroll for more.
[13:15.35]Okay.
[13:19.73]Who's this guy?
[13:22.08]It's sometimes safest to leave the level as soon as you can get the power orb.
[13:28.83]If the buttons are difficult, you can change their size in other options.
[13:32.71]Let's just go to level 2.
[13:36.21]Lava Land level 2.
[13:42.30]Watch out for the rolling tomato head.
[13:44.84]There's another one of these guys.
[13:45.76]This is just like... This really is just baby Dark Souls.
[13:56.25]The music really is very fitting.
[13:59.63]What a great job, kids.
[14:03.25]These kids did such a good job.
[14:04.67]I just took a point of damage.
[14:06.67]I need to quit the game now.
[14:14.52]I love those enemies in the top right.
[14:16.24]I can just imagine little kids drawing these.
[14:19.18]Especially this main character.
[14:25.12]This main character looks...
[14:27.46]Like a busted-up lamp.
[14:29.76]With arms.
[14:33.14]Kid didn't make the music?
[14:34.26]Yeah, they did!
[14:34.70]What are you talking about?
[14:36.56]Some little kid got like a huge orchestra and orchestrated this whole thing.
[14:41.66]These are all like four-year-olds on the instruments.
[14:49.76]Alright, I got more upgrades.
[14:51.00]Well, there's the- okay.
[14:51.84]I don't have to- I need the power orb.
[14:58.69]Only one little electricity orb?
[15:01.33]That's not cool.
[15:04.39]Ah, fuck!
[15:06.31]Shit.
[15:07.69]They also programmed the game?
[15:10.41]That's true.
[15:10.90]There's the orb.
[15:13.72]We gotta get more materials, though.
[15:15.62]I want a new weapon.
[15:16.36]There's gotta be some secret object over here, right?
[15:24.30]They wouldn't make it this difficult if there wasn't something here.
[15:28.62]Yep.
[15:29.15]Look at that chest.
[15:32.07]Look at that really crudely drawn chest.
[15:36.79]All enemies defeated.
[15:38.65]And... I got some iron.
[15:42.66]No swears.
[15:43.22]It's a kid's game, you know?
[15:44.36]You do have a point.
[15:49.02]I will take that for... I'm not gonna take that for granted.
[15:50.91]You do have a point.
[15:51.45]Like, this is a children's game.
[15:52.75]No, I should not be swearing.
[15:58.24]Ah, you've got to stop doing that.
[15:59.62]It scares me every time.
[16:01.41]Anyway, I found another portal way up in the clouds.
[16:03.75]But we're going to need to fix the bridge first.
[16:05.83]Okay.
[16:10.87]Construction.
[16:12.51]Build bridge.
[16:13.29]Okay.
[16:15.81]I can build it.
[16:18.45]Here goes nothing.
[16:19.93]There he is.
[16:20.33]There he goes again, building something.
[16:24.19]That's so fucking adorable.
[16:26.17]Well, now I have a new level, apparently.
[16:29.61]Weapons.
[16:29.93]I don't have any fire torches.
[16:33.85]Can I upgrade my... Yeah, let's upgrade the dagger again.
[16:40.49]A bunch of adults mess around and try to fool the internet.
[16:45.62]I don't know about that.
[16:49.82]I am not criticizing this game.
[16:52.50]When did I criticize this game?
[16:55.76]This game is very, very good.
[16:59.70]Look.
[17:02.13]I couldn't make a game like this.
[17:04.51]Even if I tried.
[17:07.11]Shit.
[17:08.25]I'm opening a new enemy type.
[17:09.93]It's a flying enemy.
[17:15.26]This is where we get the torches.
[17:16.80]I want a sword.
[17:17.72]I'm upgrading this dagger.
[17:20.68]I definitely should be getting swords, though.
[17:26.59]No, what are you guys... Honest to God, what are you guys on about?
[17:30.21]This is definitely like some, like, teacher decided to have, like... I'm gonna die in this children's game.
[17:36.79]Some teacher decided to have a class project where they all made, like, a little video game.
[17:44.75]This is like some, like, third grade art project.
[17:51.05]I need those torches.
[17:51.77]Oh, my God.
[17:52.79]Don't die.
[17:56.29]Drink your Estus.
[17:57.51]I know.
[17:57.71]Where are my Estus flasks?
[18:02.82]This game is like the frame rate is kind of dying on me, though.
[18:05.14]I'm not going to lie.
[18:07.70]I need to get to at least the first boss.
[18:12.00]Uncle and his nephews.
[18:13.08]Really?
[18:14.46]Oh, come on.
[18:20.25]Every swear... Oh, I forgot.
[18:21.67]This is supposed to be a... Dude, this is slugging around right now.
[18:26.67]I'm at like 22 frames a second.
[18:28.41]I got the orb.
[18:29.35]I can get the hell out of here.
[18:34.19]I'm in slow motion half the time.
[18:35.59]I'm sorry, guys.
[18:39.64]I'm going all the way up.
[18:45.50]Dude, come on.
[18:46.38]Please.
[18:48.90]Come on, like, who do these fucking developers think they are?
[18:54.09]Like, I just started to get, like, mad.
[18:56.35]Wow, like, what's, what's, what's, come on, what's with the, come on, devs.
[19:00.57]Who made this game, a bunch of kids?
[19:03.31]Yeah, yeah, they did.
[19:10.49]I gotta get rid of this little shitty dagger.
[19:21.77]We're good.
[19:24.99]Read the patch notes.
[19:25.87]Now I'm going to make a sword.
[19:28.83]This dagger is a little too much for me.
[19:32.20]Alright, let's see.
[19:37.44]I'm quite skilled at... I don't even know what he's saying.
[19:40.56]610 to die.
[19:43.38]Let's build it.
[19:52.62]Can we upgrade it?
[19:54.84]Yes, we can.
[19:55.46]Well, not yet.
[20:01.26]How do I switch weapons?
[20:03.36]Okay.
[20:06.39]That's how you switch weapons.
[20:09.57]That's a little better.
[20:10.15]Apparently he made it with his nephew.
[20:11.83]And his nephew did a bunch of drawings and he made it out of... Well, that's cute.
[20:17.68]That's really cute.
[20:22.61]This is such a contrast to the last game.
[20:28.97]So we're getting close to being at the end of this zone here.
[20:32.89]Level four.
[20:33.58]Hey, whoa, what a spawn there.
[20:35.50]Already can leave.
[20:42.74]Little kid's art.
[20:45.28]Can't wait to see the first boss.
[20:49.23]That is something.
[20:56.18]The shopkeeper's face.
[20:57.36]Oh, come on.
[21:01.28]I pressed it.
[21:01.78]I pressed it!
[21:02.28]I don't have enough strength.
[21:06.15]Yeah, I can't two-hand this.
[21:07.81]I have to two-hand this, guys.
[21:08.75]I don't have enough strength.
[21:10.95]I'm a dex build.
[21:15.41]My face when I'm a shopkeeper.
[21:24.53]That's funny.
[21:28.39]Is this why I hate kids?
[21:29.83]What?
[21:30.03]What are you talking about?
[21:30.79]This is just like a little endearing school project.
[21:36.00]Watch the boss be really hard.
[21:38.18]And I get embarrassed on stream and I can't beat a children's game.
[21:42.80]There's no indication that that guy was going to shoot fireballs.
[21:49.43]But apparently he does.
[21:51.05]Now I have to be careful.
[21:51.87]Oh my god.
[22:05.66]Come on.
[22:07.00]What?
[22:07.36]His back was turned!
[22:08.96]His back was turned!
[22:14.44]That was deceiving.
[22:15.32]That wasn't fair.
[22:17.49]Dude's fucking back is turned and he still gets me.
[22:29.45]Get over here.
[22:30.43]I don't want to jump because you'll hit me.
[22:33.14]I knew it!
[22:33.92]I knew it!
[22:34.38]And I got hit again!
[22:37.53]Dude, this is not... This is not... Oh, man.
[22:47.13]Oh, man.
[22:49.75]What?
[22:50.33]Got stuck.
[22:53.33]Okay, how... Oh, we're okay.
[22:59.60]We're good.
[23:00.46]We are alright.
[23:01.66]Things are okay.
[23:11.98]That's a lot harder than it looks.
[23:16.10]Come on, FromSoftware, what is this?
[23:23.37]Look at all those pop chips.
[23:25.45]I still have 24 health, I'm fine.
[23:27.15]No, that's... I... It's alright.
[23:37.26]We're going to get to the first boss, and we're going to upgrade the sword, and then we're going to flawless the boss.
[23:49.87]And jump.
[23:50.65]Nope.
[23:51.49]Okay, he was able to... Oh, Jesus, man.
[23:58.41]I'm starting to run out of health.
[24:07.18]One.
[24:07.80]Two.
[24:08.68]Three.
[24:11.30]Hello.
[24:11.44]Hello.
[24:12.06]Hello.
[24:12.32]Alright, there's one last guy right before the portal.
[24:20.51]Just don't screw it up.
[24:21.35]And I'm good.
[24:24.91]Let's go.
[24:27.70]Did the kids produce the soundtrack, too?
[24:30.80]I... I don't... I... I... Yes.
[24:35.43]This is new game plus plus.
[24:40.87]Weapons.
[24:41.91]Sword.
[24:42.35]Upgrade.
[24:42.81]There we go.
[24:44.18]You know, wait a minute.
[24:45.08]What?
[24:46.70]Two more stone?
[24:49.28]God damn it.
[24:52.26]Let's beat the last level here.
[24:57.02]I wonder... What is in this portal?
[25:01.12]Boss.
[25:02.07]There's the first boss.
[25:02.83]It's the fucking angry kite.
[25:06.39]Oh, this is perfect.
[25:09.97]The first children's Dark Souls boss.
[25:16.33]Oh, God.
[25:16.87]Okay, I gotta hit him once and then run away.
[25:21.34]See?
[25:24.90]Oh, shit.
[25:31.30]Oh, God.
[25:34.04]I'm gonna lose.
[25:37.83]Can I swing him from, like, up there?
[25:44.21]Don't get greedy, that's true.
[25:45.53]I gotta play this like Dark Souls.
[25:51.06]How are you supposed to avoid that?
[25:58.66]Like, can you avoid that?
[26:02.40]Got him.
[26:26.79]I thought like I thought I could like really like just spam it and win we're taking the dagger out dagger does more damage
[26:44.56]Greed in a children's game.
[26:46.98]Well, I'm safe right here
[27:03.38]Oh my god.
[27:04.14]Okay, I know how to beat it.
[27:07.79]I know the strategy.
[27:08.67]Here it is.
[27:13.33]You gotta get him to come over here.
[27:14.51]Oh, god damn it.
[27:27.01]There's not really many opportunities.
[27:28.43]Because once I hit him, I have to...
[27:35.68]Who fucking made this game?
[27:50.81]I don't know, guys.
[27:54.37]I might need to come back here when I have a better weapon.
[28:00.61]I'm not, like, fast enough.
[28:13.24]Like, I'm scared to attack him.
[28:14.40]Because he's going to do that and it's going to hit me.
[28:29.83]No, we're going back.
[28:31.29]I'm going to go to the other area.
[28:32.49]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[28:37.39]I'm not supposed to be here yet.
[28:43.57]Construction.
[28:47.97]My character is too slow to fight that guy.
[28:50.13]I'm just down here.
[28:59.74]Can't go that way.
[29:03.90]Dude, the thing just spams those things at you, and then if you attack it, he runs 100 miles per hour.
[29:08.12]Like, you're guaranteed to get hit.
[29:15.64]Where the hell am I even going right now?
[29:20.28]Is there anything?
[29:20.68]Oh, there's a chest.
[29:21.42]There's a fucking chest over here, but I don't have the ability to go get it.
[29:23.90]No, I can't.
[29:34.67]Do a hitless run.
[29:36.99]No, I need to upgrade my character's speed before I can fight that fucking boss.
[29:48.50]Do some more dodge rolling.
[29:52.32]Where the hell is that new area?
[29:53.52]Didn't it say, like, oh, I locked an area for you?
[29:58.12]Is it, like, over here?
[29:59.02]Let's see, have you got any hints?
[30:04.49]Oh, there's a new person here.
[30:09.35]Thanks for fixing the bridge.
[30:11.03]I don't have much, but you can use this.
[30:12.31]That would have been nice, like, fucking ten minutes ago.
[30:18.51]I just got, like, an extra max health.
[30:22.18]My house was destroyed.
[30:23.08]Can you rebuild it?
[30:25.66]I guess not.
[30:30.70]What the hell is even up here?
[30:34.06]Those monsters are jerks.
[30:35.00]Where are we going to live now?
[30:39.84]My beautiful house is all gone.
[30:41.23]This is, like, actually kind of morbid.
[30:49.01]Like, oh yeah, the whole village is destroyed.
[30:56.11]I'm going for a fight, but I'm going to traverse the clouds first.
[31:01.62]And, like, I pressed X. I pressed the button and it didn't do anything.
[31:06.44]I want to get up there, though.
[31:16.74]Alright, trust me when I say, the jump and controls in this game... It was made by kids!
[31:23.50]Calm down.
[31:24.30]It was made by fucking kids.
[31:27.94]Portal is higher up, if only there was another cloud here.
[31:39.41]Alright, let's make the cloud.
[31:46.51]cloud condensed okay sure thing go back up to the cloud I like this music though all right new zone we're gonna like upgrade then we can fight the flame boss again
[32:15.18]It's pretty elaborate considering it's... Hello.
[32:20.94]Oh, here it is.
[32:21.32]Good job making that cloud.
[32:22.41]Here, I made this for you.
[32:24.21]Even more max health.
[32:24.99]I've done some more research on this portal device.
[32:26.63]This one seems to be broken, but I think I can fix it for you.
[32:29.63]Bring me something special.
[32:31.15]I need something magical.
[32:32.03]Something that holds the energy of an entire world.
[32:35.03]That doesn't sound too hard to find, does it?
[32:38.99]Look, I got so much more max health now.
[32:40.63]Now I can actually go get the boss.
[32:44.17]I can go fight that stupid pizza boss.
[32:45.79]Alright, now let's go fight the pizza boss.
[33:00.42]I got way more health.
[33:16.83]This is gonna take a while, isn't it?
[33:21.92]Like, I... I'm gonna get hit.
[33:24.48]Like, I'm gonna get... I'm just gonna get hit.
[33:26.28]Like, how the fuck are you supposed to beat this?
[33:27.74]I have to just... I have to run across the stones at the top?
[33:39.67]Oh my lord.
[33:40.55]Wait, I was gonna use the sword.
[33:41.59]Come on, shoot me.
[33:52.15]There he goes.
[33:52.63]Do it again.
[34:00.19]Here comes the fire.
[34:02.75]Get back over here, please.
[34:07.79]Gonna shoot again.
[34:08.37]Come on.
[34:10.17]No greed.
[34:12.41]No greed.
[34:19.63]I need to optimize the route for Pizza Joe.
[34:22.75]Yeah, the stupid fucking pizza kite.
[34:33.02]Oh shit, it's okay.
[34:36.64]Ow.
[34:38.84]Bore him to death.
[34:40.92]That's pretty much what I'm doing.
[34:47.94]This is a no-greed speedrun.
[34:49.52]I ain't gonna die to fucking the stupid pizza box again.
[35:00.00]Shit!
[35:09.44]Come on!
[35:12.63]He just like ran into me.
[35:18.61]He doesn't always run left.
[35:19.61]Somebody said he always runs left.
[35:20.61]What are you talking about?
[35:27.63]He's running right.
[35:35.85]What?
[35:36.23]He just... He didn't give me any time at all!
[35:41.83]What?
[35:41.99]That was exceptionally long!
[35:43.52]That was so fucking long!
[35:45.16]That... Made by kids.
[35:49.62]This game is made by kids.
[35:51.65]Don't get angry.
[35:53.63]This is just much longer than it was before.
[36:09.75]What was that?
[36:10.27]Why was that one so short?
[36:19.57]Oh, God damn it.
[36:20.47]Alright, don't be greedy.
[36:22.71]This is like a slow, long, boring fight.
[36:28.74]Always runs to the left.
[36:33.74]I win.
[36:35.32]Lava Universe Zone.
[36:37.30]No!
[36:40.95]I just didn't pick up the thing that was over there.
[36:42.45]How was I supposed to know?
[36:45.97]What is that you have?
[36:46.71]That looks magical.
[36:47.45]You should show that to the scientist.
[36:49.23]I saw him jumping up into the clouds.
[36:51.57]And you gotta check out my weapons too.
[36:53.24]I've got repaired enough of my shop to build something special.
[36:57.08]A bow.
[36:57.40]I need snow.
[37:02.70]Okay, well.
[37:05.46]Missed something.
[37:06.00]How the fuck was I supposed to know that was gonna happen?
[37:09.83]Redo him for loot.
[37:10.81]No.
[37:10.91]No.
[37:15.92]That was an important item.
[37:19.12]I don't... I... No, that's Snow Eagle's bow.
[37:29.15]Damn, that guy has good fucking hair.
[37:32.43]Let's go to World 2.
[37:35.91]I can farm the pizza box when I get a better upgraded sword.
[37:41.53]It was iron?
[37:42.37]It's not gonna... It's gonna respawn the boss.
[37:51.77]Farm Pizza Joe.
[37:58.57]You guys don't like this game?
[37:59.61]What are you talking about?
[38:00.29]This game's, like, funny.
[38:02.01]This game's fun.
[38:05.00]Okay, done now.
[38:07.12]Watch this.
[38:08.86]Hey, cool.
[38:09.66]Can't believe that worked.
[38:10.30]I mean, of course it worked.
[38:11.66]Cloud Island.
[38:13.96]Cloud Island.
[38:17.24]So I'm gonna zoom.
[38:18.28]Okay, here's level one of Cloud Island.
[38:30.77]I like that.
[38:32.53]That enemy was just as dumb as he looks.
[38:40.70]As I get hit three times by the guy.
[38:43.24]Whoa, what is over there?
[38:48.58]One retry left.
[38:49.83]Alright.
[38:57.37]There's the portal.
[39:07.88]The detection on where you can jump on these clouds is a little weird.
[39:13.31]Will you please move?
[39:15.73]I can't make this jump unless you walk like one centimeter to the left.
[39:20.28]Oh my god.
[39:25.58]Like that, there we go.
[39:31.60]That thing just smiled at me.
[39:35.21]Is this snow?
[39:35.77]Alright, which one of the little kids played the guitar?
[39:41.57]Can you imagine like a little like four-year-old like just really like picking away at this?
[39:49.57]Oh, what else is over here?
[39:56.14]More snow.
[39:58.02]There's definitely a chest over here, so why not get it?
[39:59.88]There has to be something here.
[40:06.33]Right?
[40:10.99]Why would all this shit... Oh, all enemies defeated.
[40:12.63]Why would this all exist?
[40:13.45]Well, whatever.
[40:13.77]I got enough snow now.
[40:14.55]At least I think I do.
[40:20.45]This feels like a mini-clip game.
[40:22.57]I would actually agree with you.
[40:24.63]I could see that.
[40:31.96]Can't wait to see this at SGDQ.
[40:40.08]We ain't even gonna upgrade.
[40:41.22]We're just gonna go.
[40:42.34]We're going through the levels.
[40:48.71]Um...
[40:50.51]This one's just moving constantly.
[40:53.69]What is that?
[40:57.47]That is a pitchfork wheel.
[41:00.57]And it did not seem to go in the right direction.
[41:05.23]I think this is going to be one of those moving platform levels.
[41:08.04]Where you have to just wait until it gets to the very end.
[41:10.36]Okay.
[41:24.31]And what are we doing here?
[41:32.77]This is an auto-scroller, so... But where's the portal?
[41:39.69]Oh, there it is.
[41:43.75]I can't, like, hit this guy.
[41:48.67]Come on, give me the orb.
[41:50.73]So I can get out of this level.
[41:51.53]Come on.
[41:55.17]Shit.
[41:56.11]Shit.
[41:56.75]Shit.
[41:57.23]I need, like, the bow.
[41:59.51]I need the bow.
[42:00.03]Unless this guy has it.
[42:00.85]Nope.
[42:06.03]One of these random idiots is gonna have it.
[42:12.83]Come on.
[42:13.91]You have to have this.
[42:14.95]Just have it.
[42:15.35]They're all gonna come over here anyways.
[42:18.21]A lot of enemies coming over here, actually.
[42:20.55]Way too many for me to deal with.
[42:21.64]We're good.
[42:26.67]Please have it, so I don't have to stay here.
[42:28.62]Please have it.
[42:30.58]Have it.
[42:32.50]Have the orb.
[42:34.48]Damn it!
[42:37.01]Come on!
[42:43.69]Come on!
[42:45.40]Get over here!
[42:55.47]Oh, shit!
[42:57.37]I got it.
[42:57.67]Yeah, give me up.
[43:04.29]Level two.
[43:04.79]Let's just go to level three.
[43:08.25]No, let's get the bow.
[43:09.57]Let's get the bow.
[43:10.05]It's...
[43:21.36]Frankly, quite embarrassing when seeing somebody struggle with a game that was made by children.
[43:26.09]Well, that doesn't mean the game is made well.
[43:30.93]This ain't like the most polished video game I've ever played.
[43:33.29]There we go.
[43:41.75]Level 1 attack speed.
[43:42.82]Can I upgrade it?
[43:46.50]I need... How many?
[43:47.70]What do I need?
[43:48.50]More clouds.
[43:50.99]Alright, so how the hell... Hold and drag to aim the bow.
[43:53.81]Ammo is shown in the top right.
[43:57.05]Hold and drag.
[44:02.39]Well, this is a... This is going to be what you call it here, like a disaster.
[44:08.14]Because I have to use the analogs.
[44:09.28]Okay, well.
[44:13.42]Alright.
[44:16.18]It's fine, whatever, whatever.
[44:17.46]I'm assuming you get five per level.
[44:27.54]If I just used all five of those and I don't get them back, I'm gonna... God.
[44:34.75]That feeling when you start to make fun of a children's game.
[44:37.17]What are you talking about?
[44:38.39]I never made fun of this.
[44:40.15]I like this game.
[44:42.41]I actually enjoy this game.
[44:45.28]That's what you guys don't understand.
[44:50.82]This game is very... I wouldn't be playing it right now if I didn't have any fun.
[45:00.59]That's the only ammo in the hole.
[45:01.71]That would be bad.
[45:07.25]The art can be, like, a kid's style.
[45:08.65]It doesn't mean it can't be hard.
[45:09.59]That's true.
[45:10.32]That's exactly true.
[45:11.64]You have it... You have it down to... Alright, watch out for, like, the random heart enemies.
[45:16.64]Alright, I'm getting ready to buy bow.
[45:19.50]Can I cancel this?
[45:24.22]Okay.
[45:29.66]Okay.
[45:30.38]I'm gonna get him!
[45:31.02]I'm gonna get him!
[45:36.21]That's way harder to control than I think you guys understand.
[45:40.27]I promise you that's not easy to control.
[45:43.21]I swear to God.
[45:46.27]Got him.
[45:54.78]That's not easy to do.
[45:57.16]With an analog stick.
[46:02.39]I really want to upgrade the sword, though.
[46:06.89]What?
[46:07.39]Come on.
[46:12.76]No!
[46:12.90]Come on.
[46:14.90]Come on!
[46:16.54]Come on!
[46:32.80]Get up there!
[46:33.97]Get up here!
[46:34.97]Get the fuck up here!
[46:38.53]I thought that guy was part of the environment.
[46:44.33]Tim Burton music.
[46:45.55]Yeah, it's Tim Burton music.
[46:53.64]Almost there.
[46:57.70]Not much longer.
[46:58.42]Ooh, what did he drop?
[47:03.26]Oh, he dropped arrows, too.
[47:04.24]No, why would I even use those here?
[47:07.26]Okay, here's my shot.
[47:12.12]Here's my chance.
[47:12.62]I gotta hit him right in the face.
[47:16.63]Got him.
[47:19.21]One more.
[47:21.67]Oh, damn it.
[47:24.51]It's okay.
[47:25.17]We got him.
[47:37.09]Get shots like this one Okay, no more using the bow and arrow We're just gonna get up to the top.
[47:55.43]That's what we have to do on this erratic pattern
[48:07.00]No, please just get me up here.
[48:09.92]Just get me up here.
[48:13.68]I got it.
[48:14.05]Okay.
[48:14.93]I got up.
[48:19.99]Stay on this one.
[48:20.97]How much further is this?
[48:25.89]Come on.
[48:28.71]Jump to this one.
[48:31.52]There it is.
[48:32.24]There's the portal.
[48:35.99]Don't even tell me I have to do this again.
[48:38.39]No, is it sitting on a... Didn't even need to jump down.
[48:43.04]Okay, I got it.
[48:51.06]Okay.
[48:52.10]Alright.
[48:52.74]Yep.
[48:53.34]Okay.

[49:01.23]Ascend.
[49:01.87]Ascend.
[49:03.99]Ascend.
[49:12.85]Turn into the orb?
[49:14.35]I probably could.
[49:18.97]Autoplay.
[49:23.67]Up.
[49:23.79]One more time.
[49:28.83]No, not quite.
[49:29.68]Come on.
[49:32.02]I have to beat the next boss.
[49:34.90]I have to at least fight the next boss.
[49:39.06]No.
[49:40.92]Come on.
[49:44.46]No, don't do this to me, no!
[50:02.50]This, uh... This... This ain't, uh... This ain't good.
[50:14.41]This ain't, uh... This is... No, it's okay.
[50:24.52]It's not a show.
[50:25.14]No, it's okay.
[50:26.00]This is fine.
[50:26.42]This is alright.
[50:30.68]This is not bad.
[50:32.04]Don't say it's bad.
[50:34.73]It's okay.
[50:35.23]This is alright.
[50:36.45]I'm okay with this.
[50:44.48]This is alright.
[50:45.06]We're okay with this.
[50:48.40]We're not okay with this.
[50:55.41]I can't make this.
[50:56.09]I have to wait a whole nother cycle, I think.
[50:57.77]Yep.
[50:57.97]Nope.
[50:58.21]Not quite.
[50:58.69]Right here.
[51:02.55]I can't make that.
[51:03.87]Just please.
[51:04.93]Just get me to the end of the level.
[51:22.26]Can it end?
[51:23.99]I've jumped over enough clouds, right?
[51:25.71]Thank goodness.
[51:34.41]Oh, my legs are so tired from jumping all the way up here.
[51:36.41]The shopkeeper and I have been working on a teleporter that would like to take you from the shop to here.
[51:39.96]You should talk to him.
[51:41.98]No.
[51:43.48]I'm going to beat the next level.
[51:50.98]First try.
[51:56.10]Played the New Vegas multiplayer mod, is it?
[51:58.13]Is that a thing?
[52:00.73]Alright, so this is, uh, level four.
[52:03.55]Gotta beat this level and then we fight the boss.
[52:06.93]New enemy type.
[52:07.55]Looks like it's Medusa.
[52:20.64]How am I supposed to jump over here?
[52:22.08]And not get hit or fall?
[52:31.09]Zero retries left.
[52:32.23]Apparently that's not true.
[52:34.75]Apparently that is very untrue.
[52:36.25]Alright, I gotta stand still.
[52:38.63]Okay, I got the portal.
[52:52.48]I got the portal.
[52:53.22]Now we can fight the boss.
[52:57.05]I'm gonna upgrade the sword.
[52:57.89]I don't have any move bullets.
[53:06.28]Well, I'm gonna fall down that cliff again.
[53:08.20]Yep.
[53:09.32]It's okay.
[53:15.95]It's alright.
[53:16.55]We're gonna be fine.
[53:17.73]Don't worry.

[53:29.39]I don't want to die.
[53:30.57]I would like to not die here.
[53:33.73]Hopefully that... I don't even care about the items.
[53:38.91]I actually have to be careful.
