[00:08.83]Yeah.
[00:10.45]Megaton, I know.
[00:12.17]I know, this is the town.
[00:14.91]Seven years ago, I would have been, well, what's this town?
[00:17.57]You blow it up, or you don't blow it up.
[00:21.02]I know, I can't wait.
[00:21.86]Hey, Dr. Church, I really appreciate it.
[00:24.78]Thank you for healing me.
[00:26.32]Have a good day.
[00:28.06]And may the force be with you, as they say in Fallout 3.
[00:31.10]Maybe may the force be with you.
[00:36.43]Take it all, take it all, take all of it.
[00:39.95]Take literally everything on his fucking desk, everything.
[00:45.03]Take his drinks, take his whiskey, take his fan.
[00:48.93]Give me that, give me everything, take all, take it all.
[00:51.58]Activate the terminal and fucking just fuck up his computer too.
[00:57.36]Seriously can't help myself.
[01:02.49]Why would I need utensils?
[01:04.69]What?
[01:06.08]Oh, shit.
[01:07.14]They saw me take their fucking silverware and plates and stuff.
[01:10.80]I gotta get out of here.
[01:12.56]I'm sorry.
[01:14.56]Give me the book, too.
[01:17.96]I'm such a fucking kleptomaniac.
[01:19.88]I have to take everything.
[01:21.08]I'm sorry.
[01:23.74]Give me the slides.
[01:24.40]Give me that book.
[01:25.42]Open up.
[01:25.62]I don't even know what's in the fridge.
[01:26.52]Give me all of it.
[01:27.72]I'm sorry.
[01:28.22]I'm sorry.
[01:29.54]Please don't kill me.
[01:33.81]How are the noodles?
[01:34.69]Are the noodles any good?
[01:36.84]Mmm, they're pretty good.
[01:41.00]What?
[01:42.70]No, I was trying to eat the noodles.
[01:43.56]I wasn't trying to steal the noodles.
[01:45.06]Are you serious?
[01:46.74]Oh.
[01:48.68]Do I have to pay for them?
[01:49.62]Can I get a drink around here?
[01:51.90]I'd like to report someone.
[01:56.09]Oh.
[02:03.37]Okay, you've been very helpful.
[02:04.37]Thank you.
[02:04.73]Okay, how do I put my gun away?
[02:07.87]There we go.
[02:08.72]See, I'm no threat.
[02:11.14]I'm threatless.
[02:16.54]What?
[02:19.69]You guys are just on me, huh?
[02:24.21]The guy told me to come in here.
[02:25.27]I don't understand.
[02:28.01]Wow, that's a lot of stuff.
[02:31.70]That's a lot of stuff.
[02:32.88]That's a lot of things I can... Activate the VAT system!
[02:39.66]Right in the head.
[02:41.06]Boink.
[02:43.94]Did bullets even come out of the gun?
[02:46.90]What?!
[02:48.10]Wow!
[02:49.25]Wow!
[02:50.47]Wow, way too many.
[02:51.99]Way too... Fuck it.
[02:54.71]I'm going for it.
[02:57.25]It broke.
[02:57.79]It broke!
[02:58.09]They broke it!
[02:58.55]They shot it out of my hands and it broke.
[03:08.51]Who told them to do this?
[03:09.79]Did I?
[03:13.04]It's the lady.
[03:13.70]Alright, one guy is just watching this shit.
[03:20.74]Come on, kick his ass.
[03:21.82]Come on, Dr. Lee.
[03:25.17]And your winner by knockout, Dr. Lee.
[03:30.65]And your prize is to watch this guy fucking die.
[03:34.96]We gotta be smart about this.
[03:36.90]We gotta move, we gotta move quickly, because they're after us.
[03:41.06]So let's go.
[03:41.58]I don't want any dilly-dallying, hurry up.
[03:44.74]Assault!
[03:49.08]Assault!
[03:49.40]This guy's assaulting me!
[03:52.75]What does she have for a weapon right now?
[03:55.65]Is that a flashlight?
[03:56.81]Watch out for the barrel!
[04:14.14]You, you sadistic murderer.
[04:16.32]Your co-workers.
[04:18.34]Because I shot somebody with a gun.
[04:21.97]Somebody just like blew up over here.
[04:44.53]Oh boy, they're like evil farmers.
[04:46.17]Are you serious, guys?
[04:49.46]What the fuck was that?
[04:52.13]What are you guys doing?
[04:55.03]Okay, two very important questions from what just happened right there.
[04:58.21]Number one, why are you running at a guy in power armor with a baseball bat?
[05:02.90]And what teleported through space-time in the sky?
[05:05.10]A spaceship from outer space landed right in front of him, and a big green alien jumped out and started eating people.
[05:12.54]And what did our hero do, you wonder?
[05:15.22]He came up with the most cleverest of clever plans.
[05:18.56]sticky look.
[05:19.89]If we're gonna go through this journey together, you're gonna need to shut up.
[05:24.85]What?
[05:26.29]Stay away, Mungo.
[05:27.47]I don't want to catch old from you.
[05:32.14]Once upon a time, there was this dog.
[05:35.50]His name was Holy Toledo, and he was really powerful.
[05:39.62]And one day, this giant super mutant attacked him and tried carrying him off.
[05:44.99]And what did our hero do, you wonder?
[05:50.08]That was a great story.
[05:53.74]That's the town right there.
[05:56.12]I just gotta hit the remote detonator, blow the town up, and I get my cut from you two clowns?
[06:02.76]Okay.
[06:04.10]Well... I guess I probably should have told you this before, that I'm a FUCKING DOUBLE AGENT!
[06:18.18]Okay.
[06:27.29]You are just looking all over for me.
[06:30.75]I'm not gonna come out of stealth.
[06:34.39]I'm not an idiot.
[06:35.41]I didn't know they could even have rocket launchers.
[06:48.50]What?
[06:53.16]Level up!
[06:55.35]I don't know.
[06:55.75]I'm not really lost.
[06:58.96]I don't really want to report anybody.
[07:00.34]Yeah, Rivered City is run by a council.
[07:04.06]Yeah.
[07:05.58]Oh, there we go.
[07:06.16]Okay.
[07:06.99]Yeah, I think there might be ants in my room.
[07:08.81]Bye.
[07:09.95]Hey, can you check it out for me?
[07:12.21]Thank God I found somebody, because I seriously have no idea who I was even supposed to talk to about this.
[07:20.09]Yeah, so, I mean, I think I might have left some food out.
[07:23.29]That might be what happened.
[07:24.91]We did have a party here last weekend.
[07:26.31]I know we're supposed to report on all of our parties, so I'm just letting you know.
[07:30.00]And there was, like, maybe eight people here.
[07:31.94]But I'm sorry, I don't... I'm...
