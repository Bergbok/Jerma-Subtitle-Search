[00:00.40]Imagine an earwig looking up at you, and he's like... And I'm like, oh, get the envelope!
[00:08.89]Save him!
[00:10.03]And I get the envelope, and I put... I'll get him on the envelope, and I put him outside.
[00:13.03]And then the next day, it's like three that you see.
[00:15.59]And you're like, oh, wow, cool, let's save these three!
[00:19.07]To the same fucking soundtrack.
[00:24.12]Oh, save us!
[00:26.38]You're coming out of 50 in your house!
[00:29.85]and they're all dancing in a line, doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna, two antenna, top hat, top hat, top hat.
[00:36.70]It's like, well, 50 earwigs, oh my god, they're so cute, get the envelope.
[00:40.96]They all start crawling on it, you get them out, you save them, save the earwigs.
[00:45.85]And then me lying down in bed three days later, drifting off to sleep.
[00:52.15]Ah, what a nice day that was today.
[00:55.93]And the second that I fall asleep and I go into REM, they can sense it.
[01:00.21]And 2,000 earwigs just make a trail up the bed and just go into my brain to this music.
[01:06.57]And they're all going in, digging in, like eating pieces of my brain matter.
[01:11.89]And I'm just asleep.
[01:14.49]And some of them are still dancing with the top hat.
