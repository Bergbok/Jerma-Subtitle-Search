[00:01.39]Hey, what's happening everybody?
[00:03.30]Jermock here with something a little different today.
[00:06.64]This is not my typical video that I would make, but I decided to do it because I got approached by this company.
[00:14.37]They're a super cool bunch of guys over at Dorkcube and it is...
[00:18.12]The Dork Cube!
[00:19.16]Take a look at it.
[00:20.20]This is a monthly subscription box that comes in the mail, and you buy it, you open it, and there's all kinds of nerdy, geeky, epic, kind of funny gamer culture type stuff inside, and I thought I should get one, and open it for you, and, you know, give these guys a shout, give these guys a shoutout, and give you guys a shoutout, and we'll give them a shoutout.
[00:40.69]This is Dork Cube!
[00:42.34]Uh, I don't know what's inside of it.
[00:43.96]I have no idea.
[00:44.60]They sent it to me, so we're gonna see what's inside.
[00:47.27]A link will be in the description.
[00:49.05]If you want 2% off your next order, it's $20.
[00:52.75]So, save me a little bit of cash, you know?
[00:55.39]Save you guys.
[00:55.95]I've been looking out for you guys, you know what I mean?
[00:59.57]Alright, you know, let's make this, let's make this a little interesting.
[01:01.75]How about that?
[01:02.87]Right when the box opens, how about everybody writes hashtag in the comments, Loot Gap, you know what I mean?
[01:08.60]Like, we got loot, you know, that's what we'll do.
[01:11.46]So in the comments section below, right when this opens, everybody say, Loot Gap is blood in the box!
