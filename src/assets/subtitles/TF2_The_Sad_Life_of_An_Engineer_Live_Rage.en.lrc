[00:02.01]Hi, sir.
[00:03.67]Yeah.
[00:06.93]Spies?
[00:07.63]You are so scary.
[00:11.55]Yeah, I... Get... No, no!
[00:17.03]You punk!
[00:18.92]God damn it, you... Every word in the dictionary to describe hatred and pissed-offness.
[00:26.96]Let's move this up.
[00:32.13]This is where we can start to do a lot of damage, right?
[00:34.37]God damn it!
[00:49.14]Put the exit right over here.
[00:50.42]It's not that far from spawn, but it's okay.
[00:57.31]It's not that far from spawn.
[01:00.02]This teleporter is, like, as far as you can throw a baseball from spawn.
[01:03.74]Like, oh, let me just, like, toss a baseball, like, underhand.
[01:06.50]Underhanded.
[01:07.84]This is an underhand softball.
[01:10.14]You... Headless bastard.
[01:14.59]Get out of here.
[01:15.93]You... What?
[01:19.59]What?
[01:21.41]What?
[01:22.13]What?
[01:22.39]How did this happen?
[01:25.09]I gotta watch that back.
[01:26.23]What the hell just happened?
[01:28.80]This thing blew up for no reason.
[01:34.28]I'm so paranoid right now.
[01:41.80]Am I going absolutely crazy right now, or is there like a ghost on Bond Blitz that is killing my teleporter over and over again?
[01:52.45]No!
[01:53.17]No!
[01:53.99]No!
[01:54.79]No!
[01:55.61]No!
[01:56.39]No!
[02:02.52]Thank the old gods, the new gods, and the gods of old and new, and the- You get the hell- No, it's okay.
[02:11.03]It's just a regular bald-ass pyro.
[02:15.09]Anytime I see, like, a bald-ass pyro, I just automatically think spy.
[02:20.72]Just, like, a default bald pyro just running at you.
[02:24.22]Just, here, hi, I'm not a spy.
[02:26.14]Don't worry, I'm not a shmey.
[02:39.70]No!
[02:40.38]God, did you see that crit rocket?
[02:43.72]Holy... No!
[02:45.53]Where is he?
[02:46.91]Where is this guy?
[02:49.95]That just... Son of a... No, are you real?
[02:57.59]It's the Pyro back there.
[02:58.59]What I tell you guys, what I tell you, the bald-ass Pyro running around up here is a spy.
[03:05.87]Watch this.
[03:06.93]That's him right there.
[03:08.15]Yeah.
[03:09.74]Could you guess?
[03:16.36]Can I please just get this set up and not have to, like, worry about this anymore?
[03:23.00]Okay, I gotta go on the guise of Nightfall.
[03:24.74]Here we go.
[03:27.82]There has to be, like... Dude.
[03:30.44]I don't even know which one it is.
[03:34.06]This has got to get in here.
[03:36.19]Hurry.
[03:36.85]Hurry up.
[03:37.63]Hurry up.
[03:38.21]Hurry up and build.
[03:39.03]Hurry up and build.
[03:39.83]Hurry up and build.
[03:41.35]You stupid son of a bitch!
[03:42.97]I hate you!
[03:43.49]Alright, I don't hate you.
[03:45.83]I did hate you.
[03:46.99]For, like, a good five seconds right there.
[03:49.11]But I don't hate you right now.
[03:55.27]Maybe I hate myself for doing that.
[03:59.49]See, when there's a spy on the other team, or, like, multiple spies on the other team, that are just making your day just a living hell.
[04:06.67]Like, seriously, playing Engineer is, like, the scariest class to play in this game.
[04:11.84]Especially when there's, like, a friggin' unusual spy with, like, 20 billion kills on his knife.
[04:19.72]Running around, trying to get, like, free kills on you.
[04:23.38]Ain't gonna happen.
[04:25.01]You ain't gonna get me.
[04:27.61]You ain't gonna stab me.
[04:31.10]Promise you that.
[04:33.84]You son of... Oh my god, what am I doing?
[04:40.42]I fall off cliff because I idiot.
[04:45.11]Let's just keep a base out here.
[04:48.33]Get a teleporter built.
[04:51.47]Holy hell.
[04:53.99]I swear.
[04:54.83]Where is he?
[04:55.79]You fucking piece...
[04:58.97]Stop playing the Guile's theme music right now, guys, because it's on now.
[05:09.29]Hi, sniper.
[05:12.03]Get the... Yeah.
[05:13.82]Where are you going?
[05:14.64]You going down here with your Dead Ringer?
[05:18.52]Oh, I heard you.
[05:19.36]Where are you?
[05:20.34]Where'd you go?
[05:21.44]I heard it.
[05:22.52]You all heard it.
[05:23.06]I'm not going to let him get away with that.
[05:31.23]Yeah, get the... Yeah, what's up, bro?
[05:33.79]How you doing?
[05:34.99]Oh.
[05:35.99]You're the real one.
[05:39.55]Find this in the bushes.
[05:43.55]The sentry bush.
[05:45.05]Made from the... This is un... I just ruined my desk.
[05:51.29]This is... Oh, look at that!
[05:52.49]I found this bicycle!
[05:53.61]Can you believe it?
[05:56.92]It's my personal mission now.
[05:59.14]To kill that spy.
[06:04.40]Oh, look!
[06:04.83]Look who's up there!
[06:05.63]Now he doesn't have his Dead Ringer.
[06:08.23]I want- No, soldier, let me get this kill.
[06:11.07]Let me hit him.
[06:12.65]He doesn't have a Dead Ringer right now.
[06:14.61]It's my kill, not yours.
[06:17.17]It's MY kill, not yours!
[06:20.15]You leave me the fuck alone!
[06:24.74]Okay?
[06:29.16]Oh, I keep falling off of this cliff, and it's gonna make me mad.
[06:32.80]It's gonna drive me friggin' mental.
[06:38.20]Once I get this teleporter up, if I don't get trolled by spies for the remainder of the game, then we should be okay.
[06:48.15]Just gotta get it up.
[06:52.93]Keep having to use my metal on things I don't want to use the metal on.
[07:04.96]Screw you!
[07:15.14]Teleporter up.
[07:16.86]You!
[07:27.25]At least all my stuff is up.
[07:31.44]You can go ahead and, like, shoot from across the map and be a prick.
[07:34.78]That's fine.
[07:35.78]I don't even care.
[07:37.36]All I want is to get this teleporter up.
[07:39.52]Who is attacking this teleporter?
[07:42.90]Who is doing this?
[07:44.86]Somebody help me.
[07:48.18]I... This is not gonna work.
[07:51.01]It's over.
[07:52.67]Good game.
[07:55.99]Good game.
[07:59.15]At least I got that.
[07:59.97]At least I got that last laugh right there.
[08:01.90]Oh, look who it is.
[08:02.56]Oh, look who it is.
