[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.86]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.54]Jerma here, and Star, and I don't see Steph.
[00:13.95]What the hell was that?
[00:16.17]I... That was like a Chewbacca growl.
[00:20.63]I wanted to announce my presence.
[00:22.93]That's a great way to do it.
[00:24.65]I approve of that.
[00:26.30]But we're playing the Wave 666 for the Man vs. Machine thing.
[00:29.98]Probably going to get stomped right now, but you know what?
[00:33.62]It's only good fun.
[00:34.48]We'll see how far we can get, baby.
[00:37.39]So let's ready up.
[00:38.33]Who are we waiting on?
[00:39.17]I'm not ready.
[00:40.45]Where are you?
[00:41.81]I'm Chewbacca-ing in spawn.
[00:44.01]I've never played Engineer before.
[00:46.25]I need to figure out what the Engie do.
[00:50.41]What does the Engineer even do?
[00:51.47]How do you play?
[00:52.47]I don't know.
[00:53.08]I think he builds sentries and they just shoot at everything.
[00:57.06]I've never played this class.
[00:58.78]Well, we have 20 seconds before... Oh, goodness.
[01:03.62]We lost a player.
[01:05.13]Oh, yay!
[01:06.67]That sucks.
[01:09.29]Well, here we go.
[01:10.05]Here we go.
[01:12.63]We lost a guy.
[01:13.41]I'm coming.
[01:15.33]Oh, stop.
[01:15.87]You gotta get over here.
[01:18.83]Hold on, I'm wiggling.
[01:21.39]The first few were pretty easy.
[01:22.96]You can kill them while I pretend I'm sitting.
[01:24.52]Is this only one wave, or are there 600 waves?
[01:26.32]No, there's one wave.
[01:27.14]600 waves!
[01:27.70]Oh!
[01:32.89]Oh my goodness.
[01:33.69]Why are they holding down the flamethrower?
[01:37.68]Is there a reason for that?
[01:40.04]Hey, Star.
[01:40.64]So that you die.
[01:41.80]Oh, I'm lagging so bad, but there's so many crits everywhere.
[01:45.96]Oh, wow.
[01:49.59]Oh, are they coming up the stairs?
[01:50.97]Look how tall these guys are.
[01:53.45]Get out of my face.
[01:54.91]Vegas bazooka, baby.
[01:57.95]So how bad did we lose?
[01:58.75]Oh!
[02:00.17]I have a sentry.
[02:02.07]Give me the money.
[02:04.76]How come I can't see you guys on my screen?
[02:08.08]Um... Banana.
[02:09.96]My, like, HUD exploded.
[02:15.21]Oh, yeah.
[02:15.95]Super lag.
[02:16.87]We're good, we're good.
[02:17.51]We're winning.
[02:18.51]We're winning.
[02:19.41]The round's almost over.
[02:20.91]Look at the top.
[02:23.51]Yeah, the round's almost over.
[02:26.15]And there's 600 more.
[02:27.75]You better collect all the gold, the monies.
[02:29.62]You want the bonus at the end of the round.
[02:31.00]I can't even see these bears.
[02:35.50]What do you do when you run out of ammo again?
[02:38.14]Uh, you go by my dispenser.
[02:39.61]Ah, that's right.
[02:40.81]Oh no, I gotta get- I gotta get- Oh no.
[02:43.07]Go go go go go.
[02:43.87]I'm not gonna let go of this yet until I get some ammo.
[02:48.41]There it is!
[02:50.55]All these Demoman are dead right now.
[02:52.29]I don't know what a Wrangler is or what it do, so I ain't got one.
[02:55.51]What it do, what it do.
[02:56.95]Oh god.
[02:58.49]Look how good we're winning.
[03:00.64]We're actually not doing that bad, but of course, this is the first, like, 30 seconds.
[03:05.61]Well, I didn't think we'd get past 30 seconds.
[03:07.41]Oh, no.
[03:07.97]They have the bomb.
[03:09.13]I got enough money to buy some.
[03:13.79]Should I not be doing that?
[03:15.50]If you buy anything, it should be crit boosts.
[03:18.16]Oh, a sentry buster.
[03:22.18]Cool.
[03:23.20]Right here.
[03:23.60]Here we go.
[03:25.00]I've never seen a sentry buster before.
[03:27.21]What'd it do?
[03:29.17]Look at these guys.
[03:31.82]Oh no, sentry buster, get it!
[03:33.52]Oh, that sentry buster has health, doesn't it?
[03:35.46]Holy cow.
[03:36.88]Quite a bit of that health, too.
[03:37.68]I'm sorry about your busted sentry.
[03:41.26]Oh, my sentry's fine.
[03:43.40]So many frits.
[03:46.00]That hurt so much.
[03:46.74]I need... Man, the problem with this thing is... You need so much ammo.
[03:53.97]We're not even 10%, not even 5% done with this wave.
[03:55.89]Oh dear.
[03:56.23]Holy crap.
[04:01.96]Alright, we're good.
[04:05.88]Wait till they drop, wait till they drop, and... Look at this, look at this flare gun!
[04:11.67]Grits!
[04:12.21]Grits, oh my god!
[04:13.21]You should reflect those.
[04:16.93]With your gun, your primary action slot item... This is ridiculous!
[04:22.00]Right-click on it.
[04:24.64]This is ridiculous!
[04:27.85]I just respawned and came down the aisle and saw all of this.
[04:30.61]Oh my god, I got boosted.
[04:32.73]We're so dead.
[04:34.85]Hey, watch out for those things trying to backstab you.
[04:42.00]I'm scared now.
[04:42.94]Oh my, just god, I need to get back.
[04:45.72]Oh, no.
[04:46.78]I'm dead.
[04:47.66]Delete this.
[04:49.40]I don't even know.
[04:50.04]Let's go.
[04:52.71]Come on, crit boost, crit boost.
[04:56.73]Wow, they have so much health.
[04:58.63]They're never, ever, ever, ever dying.
[05:01.01]Oh, no!
[05:04.42]Buy back in.
[05:04.94]Just buy back in.
[05:05.76]Maybe they'll die.
[05:08.42]Oh, no, no, no.
[05:11.80]I'm dead.
[05:12.28]We lost.
[05:12.66]Spam.
[05:13.82]Spam the crits.
[05:15.23]I hope you guys enjoyed the video.
[05:17.49]No, we haven't lost yet.
[05:19.69]You gotta have a good mindset.
[05:23.62]There are so many dudes up there, this is ridiculous.
[05:27.72]I'm not even gonna let him walk out of spawn.
[05:29.18]I don't think there are even dudes.
[05:37.69]This is impossible!
[05:42.01]They have so much health, that's basically infinite.
[05:45.49]No, we're alright.
[05:46.41]We're okay.
[05:50.39]Yeah, the bomb will reset.
[05:51.47]You can see it's, like, in the intelligence in this one, so... Oh!
[05:53.89]It's on the ground for a while, it goes back.
[05:56.23]Damn!
[05:59.85]Why can I not... There we go.
[06:01.72]Moving my sentry up.
[06:02.88]Did we win yet?
[06:05.80]Uh, judging by... Judging by the wave indicator... Oh!
[06:11.00]Nah, we're getting doodled.
[06:18.75]We would kindly protect my sentry for like two seconds.
[06:21.21]Oh, our one dude, Renbender, he's just hanging out in spawn, just looking around.
[06:25.21]Oh, cool.
[06:27.97]I don't even know what's happening.
[06:30.66]Now he's not.
[06:32.84]Yes, he is.
[06:36.06]Oh, they're so tall.
[06:39.78]That's how they get the power.
[06:41.39]all that heavy.
[06:42.49]Oh my gosh, he killed me instantly.
[06:45.39]So much damage.
[06:48.49]I'm so scared.
[06:51.91]I love how they're all zombies.
[06:52.96]It's so funny.
[06:54.56]Oh, are they?
[06:56.48]Yeah, they are.
[06:57.30]I'm too stupid and I didn't pay attention.
[07:02.16]If you look at them with your eyes, they actually are zombies.
[07:05.10]Oh, you see, that's what I forgot to do.
[07:07.66]Oh.
[07:11.70]Dude, it's all about buying those crit canteens and just spamming around the corner.
[07:15.74]I don't even care if I die.
[07:20.44]What?
[07:20.78]That is a really bad mentality.
[07:23.54]You gotta care a little bit if you die.
[07:24.90]Dude, you just gotta go hard.
[07:31.11]Live fast.
[07:35.51]So the intelligence reset, right?
[07:37.01]Yeah, it's right there.
[07:37.75]That guy has it.
[07:39.57]Yeah, but he's fat.
[07:40.27]You can kill him.
[07:42.40]Let's just push him over.
[07:44.40]We need an equally fat guy to just push him.
[07:46.12]Sentry buster, buster coming in.
[07:48.72]Oh, star!
[07:49.62]Oh, they sent my sentry right as the buster came up.
[07:52.68]Go, go, go.
[07:53.34]I'm so sorry.
[07:55.66]But it's okay, I got an achievement.
[07:57.68]Hey, achievements are good.
[07:59.16]They, like, help you beat the wave better.
[08:04.81]Oh, wait, no they don't.
[08:06.69]Wow, this is long.
[08:10.31]Yeah, yeah.
[08:10.91]That's what she said.
[08:11.77]Yeah.
[08:14.27]That is indeed what she said.
[08:17.39]I have proof.
[08:19.07]Oh, whoops, I accidentally bought ammo refill canteens.
[08:23.17]This isn't helping me.
[08:24.59]You're an engineer.
[08:25.69]Probably the person that's the least useful in the entire game.
[08:33.40]I love how this guy's just like taunting in the corner.
[08:41.28]I'm gonna go back to the base and be useful.
[08:43.40]And get useful things.
[08:45.57]Back to the base.
[08:48.33]Oh, look at that kill feed!
[08:51.31]Here we go.
[08:52.07]Who's ever put Mad Milk on is actually a super help right now.
[08:55.59]Dude, I'm going up top.
[09:02.71]Get a bird's eye view of this whole thing.
[09:04.25]Oh, we got a tank.
[09:06.70]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[09:07.70]There's ammo at the top, right?
[09:08.81]You got a dispenser thing?
[09:10.59]I'm going back.
[09:11.53]Does the tank have the normal amount of tank health?
[09:18.33]I'm not sure.
[09:18.95]Oh, those scouts.
[09:20.98]They're so accurate.
[09:21.88]Oh, no.
[09:23.46]I'm out of ammo.
[09:28.26]Go, go, go.
[09:28.78]There's ammo in here.
[09:29.66]This is so intense, I'm writing a whole thing in my diary about this afterwards.
[09:36.94]Get rid of that tank!
[09:50.29]Too intense!
[09:54.37]Another tank?!
[09:55.20]Holy crap.
[10:00.56]Oh, I got no ammo.
[10:01.44]Give me, give me, give me.
[10:02.46]Well, this first tank's almost down.
[10:04.12]There's a scout on the side with the bomb.
[10:05.94]You can't let him bomb it, because if he bombs it, I think that's what makes us lose, is when people use a bomb.
[10:11.31]Oh, boy.
[10:11.83]Yeah, he's got it.
[10:12.37]Yep, they have scouts about to score it.
[10:16.53]No!
[10:19.61]Oh, wow.
[10:20.51]While I'm happy for that scout, kill him.
[10:22.81]Well, that was very close.
[10:25.01]I'm glad Star figured out that they were about to score it.
[10:29.32]Yeah, I always keep track of who's scoring and who's not scoring.
[10:32.26]Yeah, that's good.
[10:34.90]And there again.
[10:35.48]These guys got crits.
[10:36.74]Wow.
[10:39.47]I warned you.
[10:39.85]You should actually really, really get crit resistance for this wave as soon as you can.
[10:42.77]Because it reduces damage on like everything.
[10:45.13]By the way, they have two tanks that have zero damage done to them.
[10:47.69]Hey, watch it.
[10:48.19]Scout, scout, scout.
[10:48.79]I got an ammo scout on the point.
[10:51.04]Wow, that was good.
[10:51.88]Good pyro.
[10:58.42]Oh, they have spice.
[10:59.00]Wow, there's a tank right here that has like almost full health.
[11:03.69]Still got time.
[11:05.83]I gotta go get Crypt Booster.
[11:07.97]To kill this tank.
[11:10.57]Mmm, bomb him.
[11:25.18]Out of ammo again.
[11:26.86]We're missing money.
[11:27.96]Worry about that instead.
[11:29.00]Because I need the money.
[11:33.76]I'm out of ammo.
[11:34.24]My children.
[11:36.32]Yeah, that money back there.
[11:39.52]Yeah, we got this tank's done.
[11:42.24]Got another one literally right around the corner, though.
[11:45.76]Go, go, go, go.
[11:46.80]We're doing a lot better than I thought we would.
[11:49.74]I know.
[11:51.52]I did, like, the outro for the video already.
[11:54.22]Wait, what?
[11:56.22]I told everyone that I hope they enjoyed the video, but we haven't watched it.
[12:01.78]I exploded.
[12:02.34]Oh, no!
[12:05.52]Dammit!
[12:06.98]Oh, you tauntin' scout.
[12:12.94]Oh, wow!
[12:20.24]Smoke him.
[12:23.90]Yeah, that's not strong.
[12:26.02]Huh.
[12:28.69]Nice job.
[12:31.35]Give me that ammo.
[12:32.39]Okay, bomb's going back soon too, so I'm going to try and move my sentry up as soon as that goes right diddle.
[12:39.63]Oh, a lot of these scouts are super good.
[12:46.96]Give me the health, give me the health, give me the health.
[12:49.17]Did you just say these scouts are super good?
[12:52.81]Wait, what?
[12:53.62]Oh my god, these bots are just... Dude, these scouts are good.
[12:58.24]They've probably got a lot of playing time.
[13:00.72]Alright, we got like a second or two.
[13:03.90]Alright, yeah.
[13:07.08]You got a second or two.
[13:08.58]Bunch of big demos!
[13:10.15]Did I get spies?
[13:14.14]No.
[13:14.30]Nevermind.
[13:16.35]Get those crits!
[13:17.53]Oh, look at that barrage of death coming towards us.
[13:20.41]So much spam, I know.
[13:21.69]Oh!
[13:22.21]Oh!
[13:23.21]Oh my!
[13:25.07]Oh.
[13:25.69]You should name it Sandy.
[13:27.81]Goodness.
[13:28.88]Oh, too soon.
[13:30.30]Actually, not soon enough.
[13:31.10]It hasn't happened yet.
[13:32.68]I know, but I thought about it ahead of time.
[13:39.18]Another tank.
[13:41.93]Oh, these guys are... Oh my god.
[13:46.01]Danny Bot's too good.
[13:48.43]Oh, that's not good, that's not good, that's not good!
[13:53.19]Gotta get rid of this guy.
[13:54.13]Oh, there's another tank in here.
[13:58.70]Uh, they're about to, like, score, kinda.
[14:00.78]Well, you should kill him.
[14:01.76]No, we got it.
[14:02.52]I'm trying, they're killing me.
[14:04.10]Oh, there's a lot of demos here.
[14:08.18]Oh!
[14:11.92]Oh, get him!
[14:14.47]Oh!
[14:15.27]I thought he died!
[14:15.93]Oh, dude, he died.
[14:20.77]He, like, exploded.
[14:23.97]Oh, well.
[14:24.81]Poop!
[14:25.15]That was a good attempt, though.
[14:27.27]I mean, we only got to, like, 30 or 40% down, but... That's intense.
[14:31.91]That is crazy.
[14:34.23]So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[14:36.39]Thank you all so much for watching.
[14:37.86]I really do appreciate it.
[14:39.08]And Wave 666 is no joke.
[14:42.08]So while you have the time while the event is still going, I'm not sure if they are going to end it or not.
[14:46.93]They probably will still have it able to be selected.
[14:49.61]But go try it out for yourselves.
[14:50.91]If you complete it, congratulations to you, because it is pretty difficult.
[14:54.29]So again, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[14:57.36]And of course, take care, everybody.
