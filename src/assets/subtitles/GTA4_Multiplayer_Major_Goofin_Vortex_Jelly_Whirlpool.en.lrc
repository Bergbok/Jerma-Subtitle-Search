[03:12.91]Where is he?
[03:13.49]Oh!
[03:13.59]Oh!
[03:16.62]I gotta turn around, and we gotta go around the way, so I gotta try not to crash into a whole bunch of... Alright, seriously, look.
[03:21.76]It looks like we went through a tunnel, and our arms, like, broke in the tunnel.
[03:28.04]Oh no!
[03:28.56]I didn't mean to jump out!
[03:31.55]Asshole.
[03:32.31]Yeah, let's do it in a cop car.
[03:33.27]That's more interesting.
[03:34.31]Yeah, let's get everybody in the car.
[03:36.23]I'm coming!
[03:36.83]Alright, hold off your trigger fingers.
[03:40.13]Oh!

[03:43.57]Why do we have three stars?
[03:47.05]What happened?
[03:47.66]All I did was get in the back of the car.
[03:49.38]I have three stars right now.
[03:51.42]We didn't do anything.
[03:52.38]Okay, honest to God, I really want to watch this back and see what the hell we even did wrong.
[04:00.73]I shot a cop in the head, like, twice.
[04:03.05]Alright, well, let's turn this around.
[04:07.02]All of us maybe die and lose our stars.
[04:09.90]I can't get in.
[04:11.76]We're going off in poop.
[04:14.10]Wait for me.
[04:15.21]This car is so screwed up.
[04:17.41]We're not getting any speed.
[04:18.89]We're going so slow we're actually turning around and going the opposite direction.
[04:21.89]There were only cop cars in the city.
[04:36.39]This is like Drive-On PlayStation 1.
[04:41.03]Here we go!
[04:41.65]Yay!
[04:42.35]Yay!
[04:49.26]Oh, that sucked.
[04:51.06]My head hurts.
[04:51.80]Oh, parachute!
[04:53.60]Oh, you actually did it.
[04:54.44]You did it.
[05:03.17]Boo.
[05:03.83]Boo, look at this, like, drain.
[05:05.13]Look at this.
[05:05.51]What's going on here?
[05:06.37]It's like a... Are you getting sucked into a whirlpool?
[05:12.30]Is that you?
[05:12.66]Oh, there's a cop down there.
[05:14.00]Dude, we are sucked into this whirlpool vortex right now.
[05:17.86]Oh, it's like this terrain is, like, impossible to drive a motorcycle on.
[05:21.11]Why is this happening?
[05:22.25]There's a lot of dead cops stuck outside the drain.
[05:25.43]Over there.
[05:26.31]Boo and Irma, look towards the dots on your mini-map.
[05:30.91]Here we go.
[05:32.95]We're coming.
[05:33.61]We're about to fly to the drain.
[05:35.49]Yeah, me and Boo are inside this, like, piece of jello.
[05:38.23]There we go!
[05:41.47]Oh, wow.
[05:42.15]I almost landed on one of the boats.
[05:46.41]That's a pretty sick jump.
[05:47.54]Alright, where's this drain?
[05:49.50]I'll come find out.
[05:50.42]Me and Boo are stuck in this drained jello pudding.
[05:55.98]I can't aim, my sensitivity's too high.
[05:57.34]You can shoot!
[05:59.61]Yeah, I'm still in this piece of crap.
[06:01.97]Oh, what is this whirlpool?
[06:03.45]See, we told you.
[06:04.35]It's a trampoline whirlpool.
[06:06.55]What is this?
[06:10.61]I was just standing on the bottom of the ocean right there.
[06:12.87]There's about four cops.
[06:14.03]You can use your gun, too.
[06:15.75]Oh, man.
[06:16.61]This is... My head hurts.
[06:18.05]I can't hit anybody.
[06:18.87]What is going on with this guy?
[06:20.61]Look at this cop.
[06:22.73]Oh, this is ridiculous.
[06:23.91]You guys are in jello.
[06:26.19]What's going on?
[06:27.41]I can't even.
[06:28.39]My sensitivity is so high.
[06:30.48]I've got an idea, guys.
[06:31.38]I want to see if I can jump into that from the top.
[06:33.24]I'm trying to get out.
[06:33.92]I'm out.
[06:34.24]I got out.
[06:36.02]Stay down there where it's safe.
[06:37.58]This is a helicopter.
[06:38.74]I've got an idea.
[06:39.70]I'm sending down a life raft.
[06:43.08]Oh, my God.
[06:44.10]What are you jumping in?
[06:45.40]Hold on.
[06:45.84]Jumping in with a cop car is a life raft?
[06:50.74]You know, it would have really sucked if you'd landed on top of my, like, bonnet.
[06:55.54]And I would have, like, drowned.
[06:56.84]And obviously I would have been hurt from the collision of you landing on me with a car.
[06:59.89]Oh, the helicopter's shooting me.
[07:01.17]I have no stars.
[07:01.89]Get away.
[07:02.49]I can't... No, no.
[07:04.19]Oh!
[07:04.85]They shot my... He wasn't able to shoot me!
[07:06.93]Oh.
[07:07.49]My.
[07:08.31]God.
[07:08.45]Help.
[07:08.77]How you doing, Joe?
[07:16.84]A cop just jumped over the railing and died in the water.
[07:20.29]He dove in the water.
[07:23.31]Why?
[07:23.65]Why did he do that?
[07:25.72]Did we lose our Jello Whirlpool?
[07:28.63]I think he did.
[07:29.55]Oh my god.
[07:30.47]What?
[07:31.17]What?
[07:32.15]What?
[07:34.62]Dude, this guy... Alright, listen.
[07:38.80]Listen, the guy... I tried to open the door of that car, and the guy was on, like, drugs.
[07:44.72]He hit his arms.
[07:46.92]His arms.
[07:48.32]He's shooting me.
[07:50.85]The cops are underwater.
[07:53.08]I can't even explain what just happened.
[07:55.66]Guy was like shit-faced.
[07:57.99]And then you plowed into me.
[07:59.21]He wouldn't get out of the car.
[08:00.43]He would not get out of the car.
[08:03.15]He was looking at me like, he was like... Oh, I found a helicopter over here.
