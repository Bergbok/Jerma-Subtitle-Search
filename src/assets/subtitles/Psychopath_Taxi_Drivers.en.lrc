[00:09.92]Press enter to select sexy Layla, tough John, or sleazy Estelle.
[00:23.49]There you are, hurry up, we have a passenger to pick up.
[00:25.35]He's waiting for us at the El Banano bar.
[00:27.57]Alright, fine.
[00:31.06]He's waiting for us at the banana bar.
[00:33.62]So you're the new guy, huh?
[00:34.80]I'm Hank.
[00:35.32]I'll show you around and teach you how to drive.
[00:37.12]Oh, thanks a lot, Hank.
[00:40.08]I appreciate that.
[00:43.01]Get there as fast as possible.
[00:44.47]If you're too late, the competition will have your passenger.
[00:46.93]So, we're fighting over taxi passengers?
[00:49.41]Is that what's going on?
[00:52.81]Take shortcuts whenever you can.
[00:54.27]Take... Wait, what?
[00:57.07]The faster and safer you jump, just driving into stuff.
[01:02.32]That wasn't safe at all!
[01:05.60]So these are the passengers.
[01:07.93]Alright, hey, where are they going?
[01:09.05]No, it's a setup.
[01:09.85]Oh, we have to get out of here.
[01:12.29]What's a setup?
[01:14.61]What is a setup?
[01:16.15]What is a setup?
[01:23.06]What do you mean it's a setup?
[01:25.42]Wait, how do I drive the car?
[01:28.53]I don't understand.
[01:29.31]Why would a taxi company set you up?
[01:32.15]Is there a reason for this?
[01:33.79]A rival taxi company?
[01:35.63]What?
[01:38.27]I just... I just don't get it.
[01:42.41]I just don't get it.
[01:43.79]Why did these guys want to have a taxi battle?
[01:46.63]You know what I mean?
[01:47.49]What the... What?
[01:49.25]Where did that car even go?
[01:51.84]I'll show you a taxi battle.
[01:53.58]See you later, Frank.
[01:55.58]This is my pickup.
[02:03.95]Get in the car!
[02:06.19]Ow, my head!
[02:08.23]Oh my god, guys, I'm gonna die!
[02:16.17]How do I steal the passenger back?
[02:18.76]How do I steal this guy back?
[02:20.44]Oh my god!
[02:25.32]150 bucks?
[02:25.90]That's easy, buddy.
[02:27.68]Come on in, honey.
[02:28.96]Let's move.
[02:32.28]So... That's never gonna get old.
[02:36.42]The car boogers coming out of the giant's sneezing nose is never gonna get old.
[02:41.20]Ever.
[02:42.26]That's what that is.
[02:44.06]What kind of force is that?
[02:45.00]Like, seriously, why would that ever happen to a car?
[02:47.71]Unless it was coming out of a giant's nose during a sneeze.
[02:50.63]Watch this, ready?
[02:55.49]Out of the way.
[02:56.47]Out of the way.
[02:58.89]This passenger's mine.
[03:01.27]Sorry, Jerry.
[03:03.51]Maybe next time, Jerry.
[03:06.97]Maybe next time, Jerry.
[03:09.83]Maybe next time, Jerry!
[03:12.89]Thank you very much.
[03:19.04]No!
[03:20.02]Get away!
[03:20.72]Get away from me!
[03:23.34]Please!
[03:24.90]Get away from me, Jerry!
[03:28.53]Here it is.
[03:28.95]Around this corner.
[03:31.68]Just be careful.
[03:33.33]Don't get knocked off the edge.
[03:36.01]Okay.
[03:36.77]Secret.
[03:37.27]I found the secret.
[03:39.03]This is no secret.
[03:41.35]Bad driver.
[03:42.35]It seriously took you that fucking long to figure that out?
[03:48.80]He's right behind me.
[03:50.40]Can I lure him off the side of the road here?
[03:56.15]Nope.
[03:56.85]He's too quick.
[04:01.90]Where the hell did I just go?
[04:04.66]Oh, great.
[04:05.98]Oh, great.
[04:11.52]I'm going to bait you into this gas station, and you're going to explode.
[04:15.67]Whether you want to or not, it's gonna happen.
[04:20.21]Here you come.
[04:21.67]Yeah, good for you.
[04:23.31]Good for you.
[04:24.91]Come this way.
[04:26.23]Drive straight into this.
[04:32.82]Now he's stuck.
[04:34.00]I got him.
[04:35.04]I got him right where I want him.
[04:38.20]Yeah, that was not the correct thing to do.
[04:40.63]I'm not sure you know this, but that was really stupid for you to do that.
[04:44.37]And your head is coming through the top.
[04:46.93]Something... I don't think you're alive anymore, but to tell you the truth, I don't think you ever were to begin with.
[04:51.73]So, we're just gonna keep going.
[04:55.82]Man, that's not a good place to be standing.
[04:58.92]If you want a taxi ride, I understand, but you're gonna have to be safe about it.
[05:02.22]You're gonna have to get... Would this person really be doing this for, like, an extra 15 bucks?
[05:11.26]No, he wouldn't.
[05:15.83]I win the taxi battle.
[05:17.85]Jesus, Harry!
[05:20.95]Get... Let me just drop the passenger off!
[05:31.45]Well, I lost the game.
[05:32.79]The game's over.
[05:34.41]I have no more taxi... We're raining taxis from the sky now.
[05:40.73]That's what we're doing now?
[05:42.05]That's where we're going with this game?
[05:45.14]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
