[00:20.30]That car, he like floored it when I shot him in the head.
[00:22.66]Oh my god, this guy's out of his mind.
[00:24.20]He's dead.
[00:26.54]Wait, why did he fall out of the car?
[00:27.79]I don't know.
[00:29.29]Bruh, let me in.
[00:30.25]And where is he, by the way?
[00:32.13]Did he fall into a wormhole?
[00:34.89]How are you guys doing?
[00:35.81]Can you guys come over here?
[00:36.71]I'm going to die in need of help.
[00:43.72]I kind of saw that coming.
[00:47.27]Part of me is kind of glad I had the shitty bike so I couldn't get over there in time.
[00:51.22]Did you just slide in front of me?
[00:52.54]No, I died.
[00:54.54]Okay.
