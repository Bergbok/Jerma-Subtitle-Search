[00:07.87]Let's go ahead and type in Grand Theft Auto into the App Store search bar.
[00:14.31]Okay.
[00:15.14]Looks pretty legit, right?
[00:16.90]San Andreas, you got Vice City.
[00:19.54]And you got all this.
[00:23.14]What is all this?
[00:25.30]Grab the Auto 5.
[00:27.97]Please accidentally download me.
[00:29.97]Okay, let's go ahead and...
[00:33.75]Thumbstick is right on an ad.
[00:36.19]So we're off to a great start here.
[00:39.87]Do I have a mission to do?
[00:43.18]Or is this just pop in the game?
[00:46.46]This engine, whatever it is, can't even load 15 feet in front of me.
[00:51.42]I'm not even sure there's anything I can do here.
[00:53.42]Besides just drive around in the city and just walk around.
[00:55.48]Okay.
[01:04.99]Alright.
[01:07.27]Let's get out and walk.
[01:11.23]Does this actually have a radio like GTA as well?
[01:16.96]I want that bike.
[01:19.14]Give me that bike.
[01:22.78]Yes, thank you.
[01:23.32]Thank you for getting off of your bike and dying.
[01:26.70]Except he didn't.
[01:28.76]Oh my god, I have to unlock... Everything has to be unlocked.
[01:31.82]Money and diamonds and shit.
[01:35.42]I'll just get back in my burger car, one of the only cars I can fucking drive.
[01:39.34]Hold on.
[01:46.52]They take a very long time to load.
[01:50.84]This one has graphics.
[01:53.74]This music is so annoying.
[01:57.13]Is anyone driving this car?
[01:59.71]No, there's not.
[02:00.55]Nobody's driving the car.
[02:03.68]How do I shut this music off?!
[02:05.52]This fucking music!
[02:15.91]I can't get over this music!
[02:22.53]Shooting at the- oh boy.
[02:23.83]Am I still their car?
[02:28.74]Watch out for the cop car.
[02:31.98]God, this camera.
[02:33.42]What are you doing, camera?
[02:40.70]Why is it just singing to me?
[02:46.89]Is that a police car?
[02:48.45]Or is that a bird?
[02:49.85]Like a chickadee.
[02:54.67]Cops found you.
[02:55.37]Get rid of them.
[02:58.93]So they're just surrounding me.
[03:01.86]Holy shit!
[03:04.63]What am I supposed to do?
[03:05.17]How do you beat that?
[03:09.05]See, the greatest part about this is these two guys that... don't care at all.
[03:15.15]This is pretty normal to them, apparently.
[03:21.80]Just a normal day in Shitsville.
[03:24.56]Two guys shooting at each other through a bunch of fucking bricks.
[03:36.62]What's in those guns?
[03:38.12]There's like silly bullets in those guns.
[03:48.08]No way.
[03:51.95]We know this guy really likes this song.
[03:53.95]That's good to know.
[03:54.57]At least he's got a favorite song.
[03:58.99]This one's real bare bones.
[04:02.29]There was no loading screen.
[04:03.29]There was no menu.
[04:04.07]It's just one.
[04:04.93]Okay, um.
[04:08.95]I wish I could explain how hard this was to move.
[04:13.23]But I can't.
[04:18.63]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[04:21.51]That guy was holding a bank vault worth of money.
[04:24.50]Go get it.
[04:24.86]20 bucks.
[04:29.72]Where are you going?
[04:30.44]I'm a psycho.
[04:35.48]I can follow that guy.
[04:38.06]Get out of there.
[04:38.56]Pull him out of the window.
[04:39.46]Just rip him out of the windshield.
[04:42.12]What is going on with... That guy just turned into a bunch of luggage.
[04:45.09]There's a Mack truck.
[04:47.83]This guy's gonna... Ow.
[04:53.11]Pull him over.
[05:10.82]God.
[05:14.52]Same game, same engine, same music.
[05:17.09]The only difference is this time they decided to make you a robot Spider-Man.
[05:24.85]I guess this one's a slot machine.
[05:33.04]I'm gonna give it 15 seconds before I get run over.
[05:40.49]Is somebody behind me?
[05:42.91]Somebody's just throwing punches at me.
[05:44.27]Get out of here.
[05:44.87]Are you serious?
[05:47.91]Is he still behind me?
[05:52.55]He died.
[05:56.58]This is another goalless game.
[05:59.62]Where the goal is...
[06:13.55]You fucking idiots.
[06:15.09]Where are all these people coming from?
[06:16.69]Why are they fighting?
[06:27.78]Why?
[06:29.70]This dude's gonna stop fighting him?
[06:33.02]Why would you stop fighting this guy?
[06:34.72]I don't know.
[06:38.74]I don't understand.
[06:41.11]Is there a reason why these people are all doing this?
[06:48.14]I can sit here and watch.
[06:49.45]It's a conga line of people punching each other in the back.
[06:53.07]And then flying forward.
[07:10.75]Oh, I'm gonna need a minute after this one.
[07:27.38]It's never gonna stop.
[07:28.90]This is never gonna stop.
[07:37.58]I'm gonna die.
[07:38.62]I'm seriously gonna die.
[07:40.86]I don't think I'm gonna live through this one.
[07:56.04]This is the best thing I've ever seen in any game.
[07:59.36]There's no reason for this to be happening.
[08:08.14]I don't ever want this to end.
[08:10.66]I don't want to hit pause.
[08:12.02]I don't want to hit replay.
[08:13.18]I don't want to stop it.
[08:14.63]But you know what?
[08:15.65]It's... I gotta get out of here.
[08:16.97]I have to stop this madness.
[08:19.77]Because I'm seriously gonna throw up if I stay here any longer.
[08:23.19]As amazing as this is.
[08:24.25]But so... I'll talk...
