[00:58.31]I don't know why this is doing this.
[01:06.90]I swear I don't have... I'm not this, like, jacked.
[01:16.51]Alright.
[01:19.27]Where, um...
[01:22.42]Where's Morrowind?
[01:23.20]How do I get it?
[01:29.71]It's the tank top?
[01:30.51]Maybe, yeah.
[01:36.27]I don't own Morrowind, I don't think.
[01:38.55]What's it called?
[01:39.05]Elder Scrolls?
[01:41.82]I don't own it.
[01:43.66]I'm actually not going to buy fucking Morrowind right now.
[01:49.39]It runs fine.
[01:50.21]Vanilla?
[01:50.79]Really?
[01:51.03]Okay.
[01:51.73]Let's get rid of the giant arms.
[01:58.81]Okay.
[02:00.55]Let's get it.
[02:01.19]Morrowind.
[02:03.88]It's on sale right now?
[02:13.48]Is this game actually going to be fun or is this people are going to leave and hate this?
[02:18.91]It's $4.50 right now.
[02:21.23]That's it.
[02:23.75]Holy shit, it really is 70% off.
[02:28.32]Alright, let's go for it.
[02:28.96]I'll get it.
[02:29.24]Okay, it's coming through.
[02:41.05]Okay, here it comes.
[02:46.06]Pog, pog, pog.
[02:46.96]It's only one gig.
[02:47.74]This is a tiny game.
[02:55.96]Okay.
[02:56.54]Morrowind.
[03:03.59]Can we get a... This is going to be a terrible stream game, somebody said.
[03:07.65]This is going to be a terrible stream game.
[03:20.25]Somebody said, this is gonna suck.
[03:22.29]This is gonna suck.
[03:24.39]This is gonna suck.
[03:27.01]Well, look, this is, I guess this is what we're doing.
[03:30.81]Options.
[03:34.35]It says, wait, it's a separate menu for the, how do I, where are my options?
[03:38.01]Oh God, I think my computer's crashing.
[03:41.34]Okay, I want, there's no HD resolutions?
[03:47.50]Full screen.
[03:52.61]1920 by 1440, I guess that's close enough.
[04:04.77]It takes a long time to learn.
[04:09.68]Wait, I think I'm gonna have to learn this shit.
[04:11.28]Hold on.
[04:27.34]Learning is hard.
[04:28.70]I mean, whatever, we'll see.
[04:30.76]I'll try it.
[04:33.48]Can I even capture the game?
[04:35.66]Let's find out.
[04:49.30]Okay.
[04:59.85]Uh-oh.
[05:03.71]Fail to create shader.
[05:05.99]Continue running executable.
[05:11.58]Yes?
[05:14.18]Yes, continue, please.
[05:15.30]Wait.
[05:21.36]Wait.
[05:30.03]Here it comes!
[05:37.54]Here it comes!
[05:56.65]It doesn't work.
[06:02.75]I think it just turned off now.
[06:04.07]Alright, it just crashed out.
[06:05.47]We got to see the opening music cutscene.
[06:08.63]I'm going to try opening it again.
[06:11.88]Epic music.
[06:14.18]Fucking epic.
[06:15.78]The Elder Scrolls 3?
[06:17.14]This is The Elder Scrolls 3.
[06:29.86]Dude, it won't... I can't open it.
[06:38.47]I thought you guys said this worked on Windows 10.
[06:40.41]Do I have to go get a mod?
[06:46.47]Hold on.
[06:47.41]I'm gonna open it in a window.
[06:52.93]Okay, window.
[06:55.00]Okay, let's try that.
[07:01.68]Come on, do it.
[07:06.96]Play.
[07:10.37]Here it comes.
[07:10.75]Can you see it?
[07:16.40]Yes!
[07:19.08]This looks awful on my screen.
[07:20.64]It's half of my monitor.
[07:28.49]It's in a cube on the left side of my monitor.
[07:36.23]Let's go.
[07:38.37]The Elder Scrolls 3.
[07:41.29]Morrowind.
[07:45.29]Can we get the name change of the... You know what I'm saying?
[07:50.65]Can we get a name change, please?
[07:55.13]The stream name?
[07:58.19]Oh my god, this text is so small.
[08:02.51]Why is it so tiny?
[08:09.14]I can't even see.
[08:13.60]This is so small.
[08:17.04]View distance, real-time shaders.
[08:22.10]Don't do anything.
[08:22.92]Don't change anything.
[08:23.79]Seriously.
[08:24.19]I'm back.
[08:33.59]Okay.
[08:36.33]Okay, new game.
[08:42.87]Each event is preceded by prophecy, but without the hero, there is no event.
[08:49.20]In the waning years of the Third Era of Tamriel, a prisoner born on a certain day to uncertain parents was sent under guard without explanation to Morrowind.
[08:58.80]Whatever the rest of that says.
[09:07.92]They have taken you from the Imperial City's prison.
[09:10.82]That's cut off.
[09:11.60]First by carriage and now by boat.
[09:13.44]It's cut off from me too, so don't worry.
[09:16.37]Tomorrow we need.
[09:18.09]Fear not, for I am watchful.
[09:21.13]You have been chosen.
[09:25.15]This dude fucking gave up.
[09:26.93]I didn't.
[09:27.43]This was, everyone said to play this.
[09:29.03]Like 60% of you said to do this.
[09:30.75]We're here.
[09:32.51]Why are you shaking?
[09:34.49]Are you okay?
[09:35.77]Wake up.
[09:40.53]What?
[09:41.59]What happened?
[09:43.39]Um... Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[09:53.89]I need to fix this.
[09:58.35]Okay, there we go.
[10:00.97]My name.
[10:04.26]My name is Morrowind.
[10:07.13]Not even last night's storm could wake you.
[10:10.03]I heard them say we've reached Morrowind.
[10:12.29]I'm sure they'll let us go.
[10:17.14]Quiet.
[10:18.12]Here comes the guard.
[10:19.98]This is where you get off.
[10:21.66]Come with me.
[10:24.98]W and S move forward and back.
[10:26.12]A and D move side to side.
[10:30.50]You better do what they say.
[10:48.65]the death counter up?
[11:02.12]How could you have died this many times in the tutorial?
[11:09.72]You're playing music way too loud.
[11:12.00]Spacebar to open it.
[11:22.63]Whoa!
[11:23.13]What?
[11:58.88]Orc, I guess.
[11:59.74]Oh my god, I'm huge.
[12:02.78]Hold on.
[12:03.28]That's as low as I can make it?
[12:31.07]Yes, we've been expecting you.
[12:33.33]You'll have to be recorded before you're officially released.
[12:36.75]There are a few ways we can do this, and the choice is yours.
[12:43.21]Answer his questions.
[12:44.27]Okay.
[12:45.57]I'll get the controller off of my penis.
[12:52.38]Alright, generate a clip.
[12:53.20]One day, you chance upon a strange animal.
[12:56.42]its leg trapped in a hunter's claw snare.
[12:59.15]Judging from the bleeding, it will not survive long.
[13:02.67]What do you do?
[13:07.11]Use herbs from your pack to put it to sleep.
[13:16.46]Where's save the animal?
[13:20.42]One summer afternoon, your father gives you a choice of chores.
[13:24.32]What would you rather do?
[13:26.51]Go catch fish at the stream using a net and a line.
[13:29.63]Work in the forge with him casting iron.
[13:31.44]Or gather herbs for your mother who is preparing dinner.
[13:35.88]I would probably do this one.
[13:38.74]Why is it so tiny?
[13:39.24]I don't know why it's so small.
[13:40.52]I can't say anything.
[13:43.66]Can you talk with a louder font?
[13:48.66]I would go pick herbs for mom.
[13:50.24]Your cousin has given you a very embarrassing nickname and even worse, likes to call you it in front of your friends.
[13:58.27]You have asked him to stop, but he finds it very amusing to watch you blush.
[14:03.58]What do you do?
[14:05.03]Feed him up, then tell him that if he ever calls you that nickname again, you will bloody him worse than this time.
[14:10.93]Make up an even more embarrassing nickname for him and use it constantly until he learns his lesson.
[14:16.26]Make up a story that makes your nickname a badge of honor instead of something humiliating.
[14:19.98]That one.
[14:25.26]That one.
[14:28.24]This is a terrible practice.
[14:49.34]A person's thoughts are his own, and no one, not even a king, has the right to make such invasion into another human's mind.
[14:56.76]In these times of necessary evil, although you do not necessarily like the idea, a telepath could have certain advantages during a time of war, or, well, I've got another solution here.
[15:05.59]When we know we're going up against a telepath, just think of the worst diarrhea you've ever had in your life, everybody at the same time.
[15:11.53]When we're, like, charging into fight.
[15:13.59]Just think of the time you shit your pants and, like, you sprayed diarrhea all over your fucking underwear and stuff.
[15:18.36]And they would just see it.
[15:19.50]And they'd fuck them up.
[15:20.48]And then you get them.
[15:21.60]It would work.
[15:23.19]Everyone has to do it, though.
[15:23.89]We all have to do it.
[15:33.79]Lord of the King have nothing to fear.
[15:35.41]I don't even know.
[15:36.53]I don't like that.
[15:37.09]Okay.
[15:50.15]pocket the extra money knowing that shopkeepers in general tend to overcharge customers anyways return to the store and give the shopkeeper his hard-earned money explaining to him the mistake decide for the extra money to good use and purchase items that would help your family I'd I'd I don't know what's where what store are we at where are we you're at Walmart
[16:25.77]I would probably say, hey, it depends on the store.
[16:30.76]It's a mom-and-pop general store.
[16:32.02]Alright, if it's a mom-and-pop general store, I'm going to be like, look, I think there's a mistake here.
[16:37.36]I'm not going to do that, alright?
[16:39.96]No.
[16:40.20]While in a marketplace, you witness a thief cut a purse from a noble.
[16:44.90]Even as he does so, the noble notices and calls for the city guards.
[16:49.00]In his haste to get away, the thief drops the purse near you.
[16:53.93]Surprisingly, no one seems to notice the bag of coins at your feet.
[16:58.71]What do you do?
[17:00.51]Leave the bag there, knowing that it is better not to get involved.
[17:03.43]Pick up the bag and signal to the guard, knowing that the only honorable thing to do is return the money to its rightful owner.
[17:09.01]Pick up the bag and pocket it, knowing that the extra windfall will help your family in times of trouble.
[17:22.70]I don't think I would get involved in this.
[17:26.04]It's a noble?
[17:28.08]So what if I picked it up and brought it to the guards, and they go, There he is!
[17:33.07]That's the man that stole the noble's purse!
[17:36.21]I'm gonna get fucking destroyed.
[17:37.57]I don't know if I want to get involved in this.
[17:44.05]Oh, here, I found this.
[17:45.65]Yeah, right, right?
[17:46.57]No, I'm not touching anything.
[17:48.01]Okay.
[18:06.85]Accept the offer, reasoning that as long as the stables are cleared, it matters not who does the cleaning.
[18:12.45]Decline the offer, knowing that your father expects you to do the work, and it's better not to be in debt.
[18:18.21]Ask him to help you, knowing that two people can do a job faster than one, and agree to help him with one task of his choosing in the future.
[18:23.56]But what's the task?
[18:34.03]I think I would want to come help me do it because then whatever task... Somebody said, what lame orc are you making?
[18:53.73]Okay, sorry guys.
[18:54.57]There's me smash head with rock.
[18:57.27]It's not on this list.
[19:00.09]It's only me split the difference with friend.
[19:03.17]What do you want me to do here?
[19:04.55]No.
[19:07.69]Two of us.
[19:08.03]This happened to my mother?
[19:08.73]Position yourself between the pipe and your mother.
[19:11.37]Push your mother out of the way.
[19:12.39]Grab the hot pipe.
[19:13.27]Hmm.
[19:13.41]Hmm.
[19:32.36]I'm doing... Nope.
[19:34.04]I want option four.
[19:35.78]Excuse me.
[19:36.82]I want option four.
[19:38.90]Put leg out, foot out, and have whatever it is hit you in the top of the fucking shoe, no matter how heavy it is, no matter what it is.
[19:46.22]It's foot out, and it doesn't matter how bad it hurts.
[19:48.58]This could be a phone.
[19:49.48]This could be a kitchen item.
[19:51.99]This could be a... Anything.
[19:58.47]Foot out.
[19:59.93]Catch with foot.
[20:01.25]Doesn't matter if it smashes.
[20:02.23]It doesn't matter.
[20:04.35]No, I'm not a knife.
[20:05.23]You don't know.
[20:06.07]No, I'm just saying, like, I do this with any item.
[20:09.97]I'm always the person that if they see something about to fall, they go, oh!
[20:13.71]And they stick, I stick my right leg out to try to catch it hacky sack style with the top of my shoe.
[20:19.20]Every time.
[20:21.92]What if it was an anvil?
[20:22.76]I would still probably do it.
[20:25.10]This one.
[20:25.28]Wait, why are we kids?
[20:25.82]But why are we children?
[20:27.08]Give the sweet roll without argument, knowing that later this afternoon you will have all your friends with you and you can come take whatever he owes you.
[20:55.66]Act like you're going to give the sweet roll, but at the last minute throw it in the air hoping that they'll pay attention to it long enough for you to get a shot in at the leader.
[21:06.61]Drop the sweet roll and step on it, then get ready for the fight.
[21:15.31]Yeah, um... Where is lift up underarm and wipe sweet roll all over armpit in a circular motion?
[21:24.36]They're not going to want it after that.
[21:33.62]I'm not going to... I'm going to eat it in front of them.
[21:37.20]Where's eat it anyways?
[21:42.23]Neither would you.
[21:42.93]I'd still eat it.
[21:43.51]It's my armpit.
[21:46.63]I'll do this one.
[21:47.37]Neutral good orc.
[21:48.39]What is it all?
[21:49.83]What orcs?
[21:50.58]What do you mean?
[21:51.52]I can't be a good orc?
[21:54.06]What are you talking about?
[22:10.11]entering town you find that you are witness to a very well-dressed man running from a crowd he screams to you for help the crowd behind him seems very angry stand aside and allow the man and mob to pass realizing that it's probably best not to get involved okay rush to the town's aid immediately despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances rush to the man's aid immediately despite your lack of knowledge of the circumstances
[22:34.98]Okay, here's what I'm going to do.
[22:36.34]I'm going to get, I'm going to see him running.
[22:38.35]Alright, he's running.
[22:38.87]There he goes.
[22:39.57]I'm going to run to the crowd.
[22:41.73]First person, the person that's in the front of the crowd is going to know the most information because they want that guy the most.
[22:46.87]Not the person that's two, three, four, five, ten rows back.
[22:50.03]That person's just there because I guess I'm here, right?
[22:52.57]Whoever's in the front of that line running the fastest to get this motherfucker, I'm going to be like, I'm going to match speed and be like, what do you do?
[22:59.02]What are we doing?
[22:59.44]What do you do?
[22:59.82]What do you do?
[23:01.94]And then see what he says.
[23:08.07]This is very contextual.
[23:13.88]If they're like, oh man, we're just trying to get this guy and kick his ass for fun.
[23:19.12]Fucking shoving that guy.
[23:20.52]Right?
[23:20.96]Like, I'm pushing that guy as hard as I can.
[23:23.23]And then I'm going to turn.
[23:24.91]And it's going to be like, oh no, but then they'd be after me too.
[23:27.51]Whatever.
[23:34.54]Your personality and past reflect a rogue.
[23:38.28]Okay.
[23:38.50]There's too many of these.
[24:06.93]Which one of these is good?
[24:12.10]Which one of these is good?
[24:15.34]Pick Steed?
[24:20.44]Okay.
[24:21.02]Yes.
[24:21.28]I think.
[24:22.32]I think.
[24:37.98]You now have a stat menu.
[24:39.11]Alright.
[24:39.97]Right-clicking allows you to use your menus when you are done with them.
[24:48.47]Read your papers by pressing spacebar.
[24:53.53]Get yourself a suitable outfit unless you don't mind being mistaken for a slave or a pauper.
[24:57.74]Okay.
[25:00.80]Select skill to train?
[25:02.02]What?
[25:03.78]Sneak?
[25:05.74]I don't get it.
[25:11.18]Where do I go?
[25:17.94]I can't read this.
[25:19.20]Hold on.
[25:19.68]Is there like a make the UI bigger?
[25:43.99]Lower the resolution.
[25:51.52]Oh my god, that's horrible.
[25:55.84]This is so bad.
[25:56.90]Oh, I think I crashed it.
[26:06.49]Can you guys see?
[26:07.05]Because it's fucked up.
[26:10.15]It's fucked up.
[26:11.05]My whole computer is locked up.
[26:15.02]Come on, dude.
[26:15.66]Really?
[26:16.78]Pick it up.
[26:18.56]Thank you.
[26:18.94]Alright, take the death counter off.
[26:21.64]That joke was funny for five minutes.
[26:25.70]Mouse, hello?
[26:27.26]Where's my mouse?
[26:31.80]Okay, let's just go.
[26:32.80]This is going to be hard to read, but whatever.
[26:34.30]How do I take stuff?
[26:47.76]For release by Emperor Uriel Septim, the 567th's decree to the district of Vvardenfell of the province of Morrowind.
[26:57.64]Name Morrowind, race Orc, class Rogue.
[27:01.26]Signed... Okay, cool.
[27:05.57]Take it.
[27:05.87]Oh my goodness.
[27:16.59]I can't even see my health.
[27:19.17]That's how small my fucking health bar is with this resolution.
[27:23.66]I'm not going to even know if I take damage.
[27:26.62]Fix the UI, dude.
[27:28.20]I don't... What do you want me to do?
[27:35.26]What happened?
[27:36.84]What?
[27:39.90]What are you doing?
[27:40.56]We'll let your actions go for now, but once you're released, stuff like that will get you arrested.
[27:44.82]I've picked a candle up on your desk.
[27:49.22]Everything is free in this room.
[27:53.02]Every single object in this room is free.
[28:13.37]What the fuck else is in here?
[28:40.88]We've made your last mistake, thief.
[28:46.13]We've made your last mistake.
[28:50.57]We've made your last mistake, thief.
[28:53.89]We've made your last mistake, thief.
[28:58.18]We've made your last mistake, thief.
[29:00.52]We've made your last mistake, thief.
[29:12.64]What else is in here?
[29:13.26]Can I take the rug?
[29:24.31]Okay.
[29:25.71]So what did I get?
[29:34.74]Where's all my stuff?
[29:36.28]Where's all my stuff?
[29:37.19]I picked up everything.
[29:39.30]Wait, what?
[29:42.42]Did they take it?
[29:47.46]Oh, they took it all.
[30:03.79]Stop!
[30:04.23]I'm trying to fucking get out of here.
[30:23.62]I don't even know what's in here.
[30:35.66]Oh, sick!
[30:36.44]How do I put this on?
[30:40.62]How do I equip stuff?
[30:45.50]How do you equip stuff?
[31:03.19]Okay.
[31:07.75]Check the barrel.
[31:08.93]Get the ring inside.
[31:12.11]Ring of healing.
[31:13.03]Okay.
[31:13.37]Just take it all, right?
[31:16.57]You have a magic menu where you can see all your powers.
[31:19.36]Alright.
[31:24.44]Press R to ready active magic.
[31:30.78]What?
[31:33.77]How do I do this?
[31:39.43]Right click.
[31:40.85]Drag it.
[31:43.83]Oh, there we go.
[31:44.39]Okay.
[31:50.06]What does that do?
[31:56.04]Talk to the captain.
[31:57.88]Don't try persuasion on him.
[31:59.32]If you're not good at it, he will start to dislike you.
[32:26.79]Oh shit Oh, that's not good Okay, well Oh Shit alright.
[32:49.86]Well, I'm an orc road dreaming
[32:54.34]I know, I know, I know.
[32:55.20]Orc Rogue.
[32:55.72]I don't care.
[32:59.08]Open MW?
[32:59.36]Um... What did I do to the game?
[33:31.76]I can't move.
[33:32.32]I actually can't move.
[33:34.86]This guy's on drugs, man.
[33:38.08]What are you guys doing down here?
[33:42.13]You guys are snorting mushrooms down here.
[33:45.95]Can I leave?
[33:46.55]Okay, we're good.
[33:56.42]By the way, that fucking shit that Dr. Manhattan did to you, I'm not a fan either.
[34:01.71]Not a fan at the end of that movie.
[34:19.33]Get your cell phone.
[34:22.42]Hello, hi.
[34:23.58]Good to see you.
[34:24.54]I'm here.
[34:24.94]Okay, I am... an orc.
[34:26.16]And I look like this.
[34:27.06]Yes.
[34:27.36]Why do I hear Chewie?
[34:56.87]Okay, I know what I want to be.
[34:58.01]I don't need to take all these questions again.
[34:59.39]Don't steal anything.
[35:00.53]Okay.
[35:00.65]I would like to pick a class from the list.
[35:01.85]What was I?
[35:02.39]All these are cool.
[35:03.43]I want to be something else.
[35:27.47]I want to be a pilgrim.
[35:31.81]Should I just be a knight?
[35:33.49]Be a thief.
[35:35.34]Okay.
[35:39.44]Merry Christmas.
[35:40.22]I was like, wow, he said Merry Christmas.
[35:43.08]And what would that be?
[35:46.16]And it was the steed.
[35:47.34]Okay.
[35:50.20]Interesting.
[35:51.36]Before I stamp these papers, make sure this information is correct.
[35:56.57]Looks good to me.
[35:59.35]Thank you.
[36:01.29]See you later.
[36:01.71]Captain, let's go.
[36:02.13]See you later.
[36:02.68]Pretty good Star Wars.
[36:03.40]Luke Skywalker is looking at something, music.
[36:28.13]You should learn how to do combat.
[36:29.63]Pick up the dagger on the table and activate it by spacebar.
[36:38.06]Wait, that was wrong.
[36:47.88]How do I use it?
[36:52.07]Okay.
[36:52.97]Press F to pull out your weapon.
[36:55.61]Once your weapon is ready, hold and release the left mouse button to swing it.
[36:58.37]The harder you swing it... Okay.
[37:01.59]I can't... How do I save the game?
[37:14.68]F5.
[37:16.32]I can't save the game right now.
[37:22.32]You get a map.
[37:22.92]Okay, cool.
[37:26.32]Check the barrel to get the ring.
[37:28.26]Yep.
[37:30.99]Very cool.
[37:31.51]I've got my magic item.
[37:35.61]Alright.
[37:36.43]Nice.
[37:40.19]Talk to the captain.
[37:43.31]Hi.
[37:45.69]Okay, release...
[37:50.96]Nobody can read this.
[37:52.14]So, whatever.
[37:53.72]Morrowind.
[37:55.22]You're in Morrowind.
[37:56.26]I don't know why you're here.
[37:58.00]Why you were released from prison and shipped here.
[38:00.00]But your authorization comes directly from Emperor Ural Sipton VII himself.
[38:06.79]And I don't need to know any more than that.
[38:08.33]Alright.
[38:10.15]Okay.
[38:11.19]You are free, man.
[38:11.79]But before you go, I have instructions on your duties.
[38:15.26]What are they?
[38:16.88]This package came with the news of your arrival.
[38:19.26]You are to take it to Caius Cossades in the town of Balmora.
[38:25.25]Go to the South Wall Corner Club and ask for... Okay, we'll find him.
[38:30.41]Serve him as whatever.
[38:31.38]Alright.
[38:32.66]Alright, thanks.
[38:35.80]Alright, I got it.
[38:36.16]You got it.
[38:36.68]Thank you for everything.
[38:37.28]Yes.
[38:37.38]Bye.
[38:37.46]I feel like I'm fucking gerbil.
[38:38.88]How do I get out of my... How do I get out of here?
[39:05.67]Save.
[39:07.15]I can't save the game.
[39:13.26]Press J to use your journal and review what you've been told.
[39:15.56]Okay.
[39:25.80]Whatever you're looking for, I'm sure I don't know how to find it.
[39:42.73]I'm training!
[39:43.49]Shut up.
[39:49.88]Alright, so we gotta go... north.
[39:53.74]Wait, it said check out the trade house.
[40:07.75]Save?
[40:08.07]I just did.
[40:10.41]I saved it already.
[40:20.24]Popular scrolls.
[40:22.62]Um... What's a popular scroll?
[40:25.34]I don't care.
[40:26.20]I honestly don't care.
[40:27.72]Recover some gold?
[40:42.93]That's right.
[40:43.27]See, I had a bad run of luck playing nine holes and lost a bit of money.
[40:47.67]Normally, I'd be fine.
[40:48.53]We can usually keep some gold in our pockets just from the money the locals pay us for protection.
[40:53.12]But now some of them are holding out on me, especially that little Fetcher Fargoth.
[40:58.52]He's come up light the last couple of weeks and have shaken him down.
[41:03.42]I know he's stashing it somewhere.
[41:04.80]I'd like you to find Fargoth's hiding place.
[41:09.09]Okay.
[41:09.45]Yeah, sure.
[41:11.53]I'm not sure where he goes, but I know he wanders around town at night.
[41:15.10]Watch his movements.
[41:16.54]The best vantage point is on top of the lighthouse south of town.
[41:19.00]That will give you the nice view of all of this town.
[41:21.80]Keep an eye on where he goes.
[41:23.44]Figure out where he's hiding that gold.
[41:24.70]Alright.
[41:29.36]We got a quest.
[41:32.66]I will listen, Outlander, but make it quick.
[41:35.00]Shh, shh.
[41:43.88]Alright, let's go.
[41:46.12]So, go to the lighthouse south of town.
[41:50.42]Alright.
[41:54.81]Is that the lighthouse?
[41:57.19]Can you swim in Morrowind?
[42:07.07]What the fuck is that thing?
[42:14.93]Look at that!
[42:15.97]How do I pick it up?
[42:46.62]This would be the dumbest shit you could ever see.
[42:49.00]Somebody in the town.
[42:50.90]Um, how do I pick them up?
[42:52.22]Can I eat this?
[42:52.86]Can I pick it up or something?
[42:53.76]How do I pick it up?
[42:55.84]How do I pick this up?
[43:01.66]They don't have anything.
[43:02.60]Alright, where's the lighthouse?
[43:13.19]Bro, I can't even jump in this game.
[43:14.86]Yep.
[43:49.01]Did I eat it?
[43:51.05]How do I eat it?
[43:51.51]Is this gross?
[43:56.25]Should I not be... That seriously is the Star Wars sound.
[44:03.23]Alright, where's the lighthouse?
[44:09.55]Is that the lighthouse here?
[44:10.69]That's definitely it.
[44:13.17]Press E to jump?
[44:16.37]Why would E be jump?
[44:23.65]Okay, so I'm gonna go up here at night.
[44:26.03]Wait, can I take this stuff?
[44:29.38]Never mind.
[44:32.66]Um... You got any little secrets?
[44:37.02]Buy from merchants and traders who like you.
[44:38.90]You get better prices.
[44:39.78]Okay, well, of course.
[44:43.97]They'd treat me better.
[44:45.67]I'm gonna sneeze in his face!
[44:47.55]No, I'm not.
[44:52.05]Okay, we're good.
[44:54.27]That was weird.
[44:56.78]That was weird.
[45:00.64]That was fucking weird.
[45:02.14]Whatever.
[45:03.36]Alright, anybody up here?
[45:04.14]I can eat this bread.
[45:06.10]Is this illegal?
[45:07.30]Is this illegal?
[45:09.30]That's illegal, but whatever.
[45:10.74]No one can see me, right?
[45:17.21]That's illegal, but I can have it.
[45:22.55]Alright, can I just sleep on the ground?
[45:28.31]I should have cooked the crab meat in here.
[45:29.43]What an idiot.
[45:41.31]What?
[45:41.79]What's happening?
[45:44.03]What's going on?
[45:49.72]I'm literally stuck on this.
[45:54.08]How do I sleep on the ground?
[45:57.97]Tea?
[45:58.21]I don't even know what this guy looks like.
[46:07.81]Is that him?
[46:08.17]I don't even know what this guy looks like.
[46:26.21]What's this guy look like?
[46:29.75]That's definitely him right there.
[46:30.69]Are there binoculars?
[46:34.48]That's definitely him right there.
[46:54.84]Thank you.
[47:24.72]He doesn't have a torch anymore.
[47:31.63]Is that where he's putting the money?
[47:32.57]That's where he's putting the money.
[47:40.08]Okay.
[47:40.54]I know where he's putting the money.
[47:41.42]He put the money in the ocean.
[47:44.46]Okay.
[47:45.22]Alright, I'm going.
[48:03.79]Got it.
[48:08.67]Hell yeah.
[48:12.73]That's a lot of money.
[48:13.37]I'm not going to bring it back.
[48:15.74]Heal yourself with the ring?
[48:26.36]How do I open up the... How do I use magic?
[48:31.43]Honestly, I would probably bring it back.
[48:32.49]I just don't know where that guy even is.
[48:34.97]R?
[48:35.29]I don't even know where that guy was.
[48:43.06]It's in the shop.
[48:45.46]Oh, okay.
[48:45.94]He's here.
[48:52.78]Buy some stuff.
[48:54.58]Alright, what do you got?
[48:56.16]Barter?
[48:57.56]Ooh.
[48:57.80]Ooh.
[49:03.08]Dude, I have so much money now.
[49:06.53]I'm a thief, right?
[49:07.29]So, could I get, like, a cool dagger?
[49:08.41]Should I get a fork?
[49:14.91]Ooh, pants.
[49:15.79]Wait, okay, armor.
[49:17.21]Iron Greaves.
[49:23.86]Iron Arrow.
[49:35.17]What should I get?
[49:41.55]Why am I yawning?
[49:42.75]What the heck?
[49:44.83]I don't know why I'm yawning.
[49:50.34]I've never yawned on stream before.
[49:55.68]Boring.
[49:56.80]Boring game.
[49:59.04]I've actually been having fun.
[50:00.02]Okay, Iron Dagger.
[50:01.18]There we go.
[50:02.28]That's the one I'm going to take.
[50:05.46]Iron dagger.
[50:06.32]Let's go.
[50:08.00]Where is it?
[50:08.44]Did I buy it?
[50:14.72]Also, I'm going to get... Oh, I already had one of these.
[50:27.33]Oops.
[50:41.04]Maybe like a short sword?
[50:42.14]What about spear?
[50:45.30]What's a tanto?
[51:01.26]No, I want to put them on!
[51:04.86]I want to equip them!
[51:05.86]How do I...
[51:20.63]Guys, I can't fucking see anything, man.
[51:23.01]Offer?
[51:30.75]Okay.
[51:38.99]Do I have any other clothes?
[51:40.35]I need pants.
[52:06.29]I'm gonna get a sword.
[52:07.57]Sure, iron sword.
[52:08.41]Sure, sword.
[52:15.23]Buy it.
[52:22.33]Okay.
[52:33.20]There we go.
[52:33.80]I need a helmet too.
[52:36.78]Do not start a new fucking game, man.
[52:41.46]I need a helmet.
[52:55.80]I don't want to talk to you.
[53:09.13]Alright.
[53:09.77]You were supposed to find the hiding place.
[53:11.99]Did you find it?
[53:12.91]You found the hiding place?
[53:13.85]That's great.
[53:14.47]Where's the gold?
[53:15.03]You trying to hold out on me, orc?
[53:18.60]You found his hiding place?
[53:19.56]That's great.
[53:20.10]Where's the gold?
[53:20.52]You trying to hold out on me, orc?
[53:23.84]Um... I'm gonna bribe him 100 gold.
[53:33.11]I hear you, orc rogue.
[53:35.73]You're welcome.
[53:37.39]See?
[53:37.63]I healed elsewhere.
[53:44.69]Alright.
[53:48.67]What do you got?
[53:51.83]Services.
[53:55.26]Dump?
[53:55.74]What?
[53:56.00]Alright, I need some quests.
[54:00.64]Put me on a quest.
[54:04.46]Do you have anything?
[54:05.90]A specific place or a quest?
[54:07.53]Oh no, I gotta go north.
[54:08.71]Alright.
[54:09.51]See you guys later.
[54:16.47]Balmora, that's right.
[54:20.35]Bring out the windows magnifying glass.
[54:22.07]Alright, north.
[54:42.18]What the fuck do these signs say?
[54:46.43]Oh, this way!
[55:07.81]I'm a caravaner.
[55:09.39]I can transport you to this place.
[55:10.92]Nah.
[55:15.36]Yeah, it's so dark.
[55:16.28]I can't see anything.
[55:17.38]Can I turn the gamma up?
[55:23.26]That doesn't do anything.
[55:33.97]Oh, what's this?
[55:37.61]Yeah, I'll take it.
[55:51.26]Am I going the right way?
[55:56.96]Mushrooms.
[56:03.99]Oh, change the time.
[56:04.99]Oh shit, a rat.
[56:25.34]That fucking hurt.
[56:30.50]Rat meat.
[56:41.36]Yep, this way.
[56:41.88]How could you do that?
[56:47.66]I don't know.
[56:55.48]I'm so blown out now.
[56:58.72]Look at me.
[57:00.30]I'm super blown out.
[57:07.02]I'm blown out right now.
[57:13.77]That's better.
[57:18.87]What the... Why does it look... This looks weird, doesn't it?
[57:21.87]I'm getting blown out.
[57:33.82]Why is the FPS so shitty?
[57:40.80]I don't get it Whatever I tried
[58:03.46]Jeremiah, I asked a random dude if they liked watching you.
[58:05.14]They asked you, what's a good anime?
[58:07.07]Um... Fullmetal Alchemist, Brotherhood.
[58:20.98]What is that?
[58:26.04]Is that friendly?
[58:38.85]Is this thing asleep?
[58:41.63]Can I talk to it?
[58:43.33]This thing is sleeping.
[58:56.14]Can I ride it?
[59:01.06]That's cute.
[59:01.74]I like that thing.
[59:02.26]Okay.
[59:05.82]I lost track of where I was going.
[59:07.12]I think it's this way.
[59:18.25]That monster is bored.
[59:33.80]Nope.
[59:35.34]Nope.
[59:37.76]This way.
[59:54.83]Wait, something over here.
[59:56.11]An adventure awaits us.
[59:58.67]What's over here?
[60:00.48]Random adventure awaits.
[60:02.82]In Morrowind.
[60:23.93]How do you quick- how do you load?
[61:02.25]What the fuck?
[61:02.85]What happened to me?
[61:04.63]What happened?
[61:08.25]Did I walk into the fire?
[61:10.67]What?
[61:11.01]I don't understand what happened.
[61:15.38]I'm definitely... This is too high for me, but whatever.
[61:16.98]I can probably get the kill.
[61:19.82]Let's go.
[61:20.36]Fuck it.
[61:34.09]How the fuck are you supposed to do this?
[61:42.19]What class am I?
[61:43.56]I don't... Piano player?
[61:46.14]Whatever it is.
[61:46.66]Bard?
[61:46.90]I don't even... What am I?
[61:50.28]I got a better idea.
[61:53.88]You are taking up the entire... How is your body taking up the entire tunnel?
[61:58.50]That is... How?
[62:01.00]How do I heal R, right?
[62:10.43]I don't fucking care Adventure awaits on the road
[62:33.28]This game is 80 years old today.
[62:35.30]Wait, I can use my other knife?
[62:40.67]I have another knife.
[62:48.62]I can't use that.
[63:02.92]Oh, Balmora.
[63:03.54]How are you?
[63:05.78]There's a bandit nearby.
[63:06.56]What?
[63:33.64]What is going on?
[63:36.74]Oh, never mind the jewels.
[63:37.50]I just want to find that bandit again.
[63:39.98]He was charming and funny.
[63:41.90]And I simply must see him again.
[63:43.94]His name?
[63:45.34]Nellos.
[63:46.02]Nellos Anmar.
[63:47.36]A name that will stay on my lips for eternity.
[63:49.84]Perhaps you can find him.
[63:51.55]Please, I cannot live without knowing if you could ever love me.
[63:54.75]I have nothing to offer you in return, but could you not help me for the sake of love?
[64:04.90]Sure.
[64:09.62]Okay.
[64:11.57]I'm sure you'll be able to find him.
[64:12.69]He mentioned something about having to head north.
[64:15.89]So I imagine he might be found in Pelagaiad.
[64:20.53]Please find and give him this glove for me.
[64:22.99]As a token of my love, I'm certain he will want to find me again.
[64:25.31]Okay.
[64:27.80]Can I keep the jewels?
[64:30.10]Alright, so Pelagaiad.

[66:04.09]What the hell is going on with this door?
[66:06.69]What the fuck is this?
[66:08.51]Did I just let out like the demon bug?
[66:10.19]Oh my god, it's coming after me.
[66:16.50]What?
[66:17.08]What is behind that door?
[66:20.40]That music is way too heroic for what's in here.
[66:26.85]Do you understand?
[66:28.79]That was like a nice... That wasn't scary demon music.
[66:50.56]Am I even hitting this?
[66:55.00]Dude, I'm going to prove to everybody how cool I am.
[66:57.16]I'm going to kill this thing.
[67:00.20]Holy shit, I just killed... Look what I just did.
[67:07.71]So what was in here?
[67:24.60]What?
[67:28.80]It's an electric fence?
[67:30.81]Why is there an electric fence in here?
[67:34.03]What are you talking about?
[67:40.16]That took me so long to die, too.
[67:41.56]That was an actor.
[68:04.22]What are you gonna do about it?
[68:04.86]Huh?
[68:05.99]What are you gonna do about it?

[99:04.65]And then I try to steal something.
[99:07.07]And...
[99:16.08]Where's this place?
[99:19.80]Whoa!
[99:21.42]Shit, that person was stupid.
[99:23.54]That was a player.
[99:25.04]That was a player that didn't realize who I was.
[99:28.39]Oh, shit.
[99:29.21]Alright, where's this house?

[99:35.43]Why would I go into the guard tower?
[99:37.71]This is the guard tower.
[99:39.57]Why would I go in here?
[99:41.35]Oh, my God.
[100:06.28]And then I'm gonna fucking write in big, like, red ink, like, fuck you, I was here.
[100:11.06]And they're gonna know exactly who it was.

[100:20.33]I can't move.
[100:21.41]I can't move.

[100:24.27]How do I get rid of this?
[100:25.79]How do I get rid of this?
[100:27.75]I'm fucking stealing... I'm stealing serving platters.
[100:30.71]Like, what am I gonna do with these?
[100:45.68]Why does the door open this way?
[100:48.16]What are you doing?
[100:49.04]I can't... Don't move.
[100:50.35]He doesn't see me.
[101:00.24]I'm stuck in a fucking door.
[101:01.68]Oh my god, I haven't saved it in like an hour.
[101:28.84]Open this way.
[101:30.26]What kind of a psycho has a door?
[101:32.94]No, you always have the door open this way.
[101:35.84]Every time.
[101:39.92]Oh no, I got it.
[101:40.44]I'm good.
[101:41.10]Okay, thank god.
[101:42.16]Thank god I was smart enough.
[101:49.19]You didn't have to catch me.
[101:56.90]Now where?
[101:57.50]Go right for the quest?
[103:11.75]I slept 15 hours in this guy's house.
[103:23.08]Why can't I hit him?
[103:32.20]Why can't we hurt each other?
[103:35.71]Oh my god, fucking stop it!

[104:41.67]rotting for 24 hours.
[104:44.55]Alright, has anybody come find him?
[104:51.31]It's been two days.
[104:52.17]It's been three days.
[104:57.48]I spent almost a full work week in this guy's house.
[105:14.59]What day is it?
[105:17.45]Okay.
[105:19.95]Can you imagine?
[105:26.10]Look, this person's been sleeping... Alright, so this person's asleep in your bed.
[105:30.52]And you get in a big fight with him, and he leaves.
[105:32.22]And you kind of go, I don't know how long... That guy must have been here for a while.
[105:35.74]What the fuck?
[105:36.32]I wonder how long he was here for.
[105:37.40]Maybe like 40 minutes.
[105:39.20]And there is a warm imprint...
[105:42.65]of a person's body.
[105:44.31]And it's hot to the touch.
[105:46.45]They've been there for a very, very long time.
[105:50.40]What is all this shit?
[105:51.34]I don't even want any of this.
[105:54.56]What, am I just taking all the drugs the guy had in his house?
[105:58.22]Just take it all, whatever.
[105:59.20]How do I do it?
[106:04.45]I'm just literally drinking everything that this guy has.
[106:07.21]This could be Windex.
[106:08.01]I don't even know what it is.
[106:18.62]Okay, am I still over-encumbered?
[106:21.12]Wait, can I eat the candle?
[106:24.11]Why am I sprinting?
[106:24.93]What's going on?
[106:26.29]Okay, that was scary.
[106:29.87]Holy shit, this guy had a silver dagger?
[106:32.17]Oh my god, I got a whole new outfit.
[106:39.60]This is perfect.
[106:52.85]Wow.
[106:55.11]Alright.
[106:55.97]Where's that steel dagger?
[106:58.90]Yeah.
[107:00.78]Let's fucking go.
[107:05.00]Why am I holding a candle?
[107:27.10]Ooh, he's got money.
[107:36.26]Just for good measure, just to BM him a little bit more.
[107:37.94]Alright, I'm ready.
[108:09.70]Wait, these are expensive.
[108:14.37]Okay, let's go.
[108:23.13]Hey, hey.
[108:24.91]Nothing hates me.
[108:28.41]Man, I just love sleeping.
[108:30.21]Can I just tell you that?
[108:30.95]That's why you haven't seen me in a while.
[108:34.90]Hey.
[108:35.02]Have you ever heard of this thing called lucid dreaming?
[108:38.12]Oh shit.
[108:39.44]I'll tell you later.
[108:42.14]I'll tell you later.
[108:54.22]What was the quest?
[109:05.98]Alright, I think I'm good.
[109:09.30]Oh my god, leave me alone, dude!
[109:18.27]Oh, fuck!
[109:24.19]Am I safe?
[109:47.60]Somebody has a diamond.
[109:55.59]Where's that diamond place?
[109:59.60]You gotta be kidding me, man.
[110:22.21]How do I swim up?
[110:23.85]How do I swim up?
[110:27.25]Why am I not swimming up?
[110:28.23]How do I swim up?
[110:31.33]How do you swim up?
[110:42.57]Just look up, okay.
[110:43.13]Alright, I think I'm good.

[122:42.03]I owe 4800 gold.
[123:20.25]What?
[123:22.71]You've been released after 48 days.
[123:29.84]And I lost all this?

[123:49.54]I got a quicksave, stupid idiots.
[123:51.16]I have time travel, you don't.
[123:52.48]I'm gonna time travel back before you even arrested me.
[124:07.26]Go up the fucking stairs, you imbecile.
[124:21.31]Oh, I could have just gone up here.
[124:22.17]Alright.
[124:26.30]Okay, in Morrowind to USD, what is 5,000 gold in Morrowind to USD?
[124:35.05]What would that be?

[125:32.66]Can I seriously, like, get... I gotta...
[125:36.13]I have to just clear my name.
[125:38.13]I have to just get arrested.
[125:40.73]I'm never gonna be able to do anything.
[125:50.26]I got a better fucking idea.
[125:56.20]Hide the items?
[126:05.14]Wait.
[126:06.72]What do you mean?
[126:07.36]If I... Will this actually work?
[126:29.69]so so
[127:02.00]I don't know what's stolen and what's not stolen, so I'm just gonna throw it all.
[127:10.85]No, put that back on.
[127:24.74]That's a pretty damn good sandwich.
[127:28.29]I'm gonna despawn them?
[127:39.51]Okay, so... What the fuck?
[127:42.22]I throw my stuff away!
[127:43.86]Alright, I'm gonna... They have to be in a building?
[127:54.78]Oh, you already aggroed this guy.
[127:56.34]Alright.
[127:57.07]I'm... I've had just about fucking enough.
[128:06.83]I've had just about enough.
[128:25.91]What the fuck?
[128:26.97]Never mind.

[128:38.27]Give me the diamond now.
[128:40.09]It's in there.
[128:40.89]I know it's in here somewhere.
[128:41.75]Just give it to me.
[128:42.79]Move out of the way.
[128:46.63]Hold on.
[128:47.37]I'll get this in a minute.
[129:00.33]Hey!
[129:08.07]Watch out for the lady!
[129:11.06]Okay, I'm gonna kill her.
[129:12.48]I'm just gonna kill her and leave.
[129:14.20]I'm gonna kill her and leave.
[129:16.42]I fucked this whole playthrough up so bad.
[129:17.88]I'm just gonna kill her and leave.
[129:24.82]I'm in the thieves guild.
[129:25.88]I'm a bad guy.
[129:37.52]It's on the shelf?
[129:41.92]Are you dumb?
[129:51.64]Why would you put diamonds on a shelf that right there?
[129:55.05]You gotta be stupid.
[130:00.46]That was really dumb!
[130:05.78]Okay, quest complete.
[130:11.81]Now I gotta go talk to North-East, right?
[130:14.09]Oh shit.
[130:28.65]Alright, where's the bed?
[130:29.63]Okay, this way.
[130:32.03]I'm going back to the guild, yep.
[130:44.63]Did I- do we have any money?
[130:50.49]I thought I was- Oh my god!
[130:54.43]What?! !
[130:57.12]Why are you so fast?!
[130:59.72]Alright, I'm self- This is self-defense.
[131:00.96]This is self-defense.
[131:02.45]This is self-defense.
[131:03.21]It's self-defense.
[131:10.99]Fuck everybody.
[131:29.23]Alright, where is it?
[131:32.07]Where is it?
[131:32.61]Down right here.
[131:33.57]Okay, so I just gotta go this way and then come up.
[131:37.93]You're gonna have to flee into the wilderness.
[131:41.99]That's fine.
[131:42.61]I just wanna do my job.
[131:51.58]Too bad I don't have a bow and arrow.
[131:55.60]He's a menace to society.
[131:58.86]One of the reasons why I really can't play any of the games like this, Elder Scrolls or whatever, is because it snowballs.
[132:05.60]I take a plate off of a shelf and I owe 20 gold.
[132:09.78]And then I punch the guy that tries to get the, you know, the warrant from me.
[132:13.66]I then kill a lady in the, next to the, hold on.
[132:25.03]It just snowballs and now I owe 10 grand.
[132:32.02]I have an uncountable amount of money that I have to pay back, so it's over.
[132:36.56]Just don't be a fucking loon.
[132:41.84]It's like Grand Theft Auto, but in Gra- okay.
[132:45.42]In GTA, if I punch a person on the street, I- okay.
[132:48.70]Oh, you're gonna- okay, you die.
[132:49.94]You're gonna- you're gonna- whatever.
[132:50.94]The place, wanted, wasted.
[132:53.50]There are game-altering consequences for, like, punching somebody GTA-style on the street.
[132:59.17]I know.
[132:59.59]I know it's not GTA, but I... I can't help it.
[133:06.75]I'm going downstairs.
[133:10.43]Any game with freedom, I just kind of... Hunchipers.
[133:13.17]You got any... You got any mead?
[133:33.19]No, no more stealing.
[133:33.93]Let's go.
[133:37.86]Alright, so now it's right here.
[133:39.78]No, it's not.
[133:40.48]Where is it?
[133:41.86]Right there.
[133:45.64]Is this building here?
[133:50.14]Alright, quest going in.
[133:53.62]Did it.
[134:00.05]I have a diamond.
[134:02.47]Here it is.
[134:02.83]Ooh, we'll take care of everything.
[134:05.11]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[134:06.39]What do you want?
[134:38.09]It's a healing spell.
[134:39.23]Relax.
[134:40.65]You've never seen a healing spell before?
[134:42.13]Okay.
[134:42.43]Get rid of the bounty?
[134:43.83]I owe $10,000.
[134:44.05]Go to the basement.
[134:46.23]Okay.
[135:02.83]For a small fee, I can take care of that.
[135:08.14]What?
[135:13.34]Word on the street is that you've got about 5300 gold on your head.
[135:17.44]As you're a Thieves Guild member, I could fix it for 2678.
[135:23.90]Smart thinking, Toad, but it's still a ton.
[135:27.68]What's this, then?
[135:28.76]It's like somebody being like, oh, dude, you owe $10 million.
[135:31.86]Dude, just pay me $3 million and it'll be fine.
[135:37.14]It's still... It's over a million dollars.
[135:39.52]That's going to be impossible for me.
[135:40.98]You understand?
[135:41.44]It doesn't matter what it is.
[135:42.64]It's over a certain threshold.
[135:44.11]You have questions?
[135:49.95]Yes.
[135:52.34]Sell all your armor.
[135:55.10]Can I sell my armor to this guy?
[135:57.04]This guy has 150 bucks.
[136:02.17]I can't get 3,000 gold from this person.
[136:08.29]Do I have anything that's worth anything?
[136:12.69]Holy shit, this stuff is worth a lot of money.
[136:14.78]This is worth 1,000 bucks?! !
[136:23.23]What the fuck?
[136:23.87]300?
[136:23.89]Alright, I might be able to actually do this.
[136:26.83]Okay.
[136:42.54]Didn't I just do this?
[136:45.48]Okay.
[136:50.10]What is all this?
[136:53.44]Don't sell your armor.
[136:54.29]No, I'm not gonna.
[136:56.39]Why am I blurry?
[136:59.25]Eh, it's a new camera.
[137:02.09]Save before any crimes, because you're just gonna be an outlaw.
[137:04.33]Yeah, it's alright.
[137:05.86]It's all good.
[137:06.80]Okay, so...
[137:21.22]Now, what was the other thing I had to do?
[137:23.24]Find this person.
[137:23.90]They're apparently up here, right?
[137:29.53]Go to jail.
[137:30.37]You just got the armor, dude.
[137:31.61]Just go to jail.
[137:35.09]Walk to the end of the street to win the game.
[137:41.14]Northeast corner.
[137:42.18]Alright, you got it.
[137:50.65]God, I wish there was a burp button.
[137:55.25]Okay.
[137:56.59]So where is this guy?
[138:04.28]What am I looking for?
[138:04.94]I missed it?
[138:10.35]I don't know who I'm looking for.
[138:11.97]FNAF armor?
[138:24.13]Go to the... up the stairs.
[138:28.87]Wasn't that a guard house though?
[138:33.31]This one?
[138:35.67]Get away from me.
[138:52.20]You look like Springtrap.
[139:01.54]That's so stupid.

[139:05.48]These ones.

[139:59.67]You had a package.
[140:06.26]What do you mean I had a package?
[140:16.97]I had a package to give this person?
[140:19.97]I dropped the book.
