[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.41]Alright.
[00:03.57]Hi.
[00:06.32]We're going to move on to another game that I have been sitting on for a while.
[00:10.72]This is a singing game.
[00:13.18]It's called One Hand Clapping.
[00:16.61]You have to sing to play the game.
[00:19.67]I will find out if it's any good.
[00:24.08]Checking it out Thursdays.
[00:33.93]Turn this down.
[00:34.77]Just give me one sec.
[00:36.23]Well, I think I have to calibrate it too.
[00:38.23]Let's find out.
[00:47.59]It's Wednesday?
[00:48.37]Oh.
[00:50.87]It is Wednesday.
[00:55.39]Well, okay.
[00:57.87]Hopefully this can pick up my microphone.
[01:07.25]Alright.
[01:07.75]I'll be... Give me one sec.
[01:11.99]It says a microphone is required to play, which I have.
[01:14.81]Well, what the fuck?
[01:16.63]Hello?
[01:17.93]Can you guys hear this?
[01:21.64]Oh, okay.
[01:23.76]Use wired headphones?
[01:26.08]Oh, no.
[01:26.66]Wait a minute.
[01:29.44]I'm gonna... Should I mute myself?
[01:33.14]If I do this, you'll just hear me, right?
[01:42.03]I'm de-muting the actual microphone.
[01:43.95]And I'm speech jamming myself because I heard, oh my god.
[01:48.49]Okay.
[01:51.44]I can still hear myself.
[02:33.53]The meter should light up when you sing and turn off when you're quiet.
[02:38.69]Make sure it's not activated by breathing or background noise.
[02:40.93]Can you guys, you can't, that's not way too dang.
[02:44.91]I'm delayed though.
[02:45.45]Okay.
[03:02.64]I think this is fine.
[03:04.46]Alright.
[03:13.85]I actually have to keep this off.
[03:16.23]This is going to be so stupid.
[03:17.63]What a terrible stream this is going to be.
[03:21.96]I need to get my...
[03:33.85]Okay.
[03:39.49]I have to delay my webcam.
[03:43.26]It sounds like you're giving a speech.
[03:47.54]I need to delay the webcam by like a tenth of a second.
[03:53.02]Hold on.
[03:55.04]Actually, this might be really funny.
[03:56.76]This might be fucking funny.
[04:00.55]You tell me when it's matched up.
[04:03.60]Am I matched up?
[04:05.98]One, two, three.
[04:13.37]One, two, three.
[04:15.53]Is that better?
[04:17.19]One, two, three.
[04:19.91]Turn it up?
[04:20.69]I mean, it's the game.
[04:22.27]This is as low as I can go, man.
[04:25.17]I can't turn the audio up.
[04:27.13]Maybe I can.
[04:27.67]Hold on.
[04:28.75]One, two.
[04:30.37]I'm sorry.
[04:35.19]It's gonna be loud.
[04:39.03]Is this okay?
[04:43.63]This is not a stream routine.
[04:46.15]This is not a stream that, this is the game.
[04:49.09]It's too quiet still.
[04:51.79]It's gonna go really fucking loud.
[04:55.31]It's gonna go really loud.
[04:56.65]Turn your fucking speakers down right now.
[04:58.87]Turn your speakers down.
[05:03.71]How's that?
[05:07.42]Ah.
[05:09.08]We good?
[05:11.94]But if the music, alright, honestly turn your shit down, the music might be insanely loud.
[05:20.60]It's gonna be so loud.
[05:22.12]Turn your speakers, I'm serious.
[05:25.64]Ah, ah, ah.
[05:30.00]Ah.
[05:35.42]Can you even hear it?
[05:42.70]It sounds like I'm driving a car wash.
[05:57.39]What do I do?
[06:04.85]What am I doing?
[06:12.43]Am I missing something?
[06:24.15]Ah.
[06:27.94]Ah.
[06:34.34]Oh, over here.
[06:42.20]Did I break the game?
[06:50.11]Oh, new game.
[06:51.19]Have it be called, I don't know.
[06:53.77]The game's called One Hand Clapping.
[06:57.97]Go left.
[07:02.99]Oh, I know what to do.
[07:04.79]I couldn't do that with the headphones anyway.
[07:07.98]I can jump.
[07:10.18]My microphone's fine.
[07:44.28]It's like an ambulance driving by really fast.
[07:50.68]We're good.
[08:00.05]Am I safe down over here?
[08:04.01]No.
[08:20.24]The audio is awful.
[08:21.84]That's the game.
[08:23.60]That is the game.
[08:36.04]Um...
[08:56.50]Oh, I was on the key.
[08:57.98]What's going on?
[08:59.44]Hey, uh, uh, I should be here in a minute.
[09:01.91]Wait.
[09:02.11]Yeah, I'll be right there.
[09:17.12]I thought I just... I thought I just wiped it off you.
[09:18.94]I was like, holy shit, that's what I fucking sound like?
[09:23.58]That was like, no way I sound like shit.
[09:29.60]How do I do this?
[09:31.08]Eeeeeee! E. E!.
[09:42.06]How is... I... How do I get that over with?
[09:58.44]Oh.
[09:59.60]Duke Peter Griffin.
[10:03.68]Hey Loish, let's sing a song.
[10:06.27]That's like Otto.
[10:10.66]How do I get this to work?
[10:54.69]I can't do it with it on.
[11:01.70]Wait.
[11:02.68]Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh...
[11:23.97]No, no, no, no, no.
[12:00.34]How do I do this?
[12:04.08]I'm so mad.
[12:09.72]I can't get up here.
[12:14.69]Is it a B?
[12:24.30]I can't breathe, oh my god.
[12:25.94]Fuck.

[12:37.01]I, I, do, do, knee, knee, choo, choo, go, go, choo, choo, the, the, story, story.
[12:44.67]It's fucking horrible.
[12:59.45]This is what I hear.
[13:01.34]Hi guys.
[13:02.38]This is what I hear.
[13:03.84]I hear this.
[13:04.38]Isn't that tough to listen to?
[14:26.72]Oh.
[14:29.76]Really?
[14:32.91]It sounds literally better.
[14:35.67]This does not sound better.
[14:39.37]No, it does not.
[14:42.89]There's no way this sounds better.
[14:48.51]It does sound better.
[14:49.47]Give me a clip.
[14:51.09]One, two, three.
[14:51.95]One, two, three.
[14:53.85]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[14:55.32]I want to hear it.
[15:01.72]Let me see.
[15:05.95]It's equally as bad.
[15:09.41]That's for a different video game.
[15:17.62]It sounds literally better.
[15:20.34]This does not sound better.
[15:24.02]No, it does not.
[15:27.54]There's no way this sounds better.
[15:33.16]It does sound better.
[15:34.14]Give me a clip.
[15:35.74]One, two, three.
[15:36.60]One, two, three.
[15:37.50]Ah, ah, ah.

[15:42.10]That sounds like shit, guys.
[15:44.58]Alright, fine.
[15:45.30]I'll keep it on.
[15:46.40]I'm turning this shit off during important things.
[15:53.75]Okay.
[15:58.45]So what do I do?
[16:06.52]I broke it?
[16:07.60]No, I didn't.

[17:40.28]Fucking easy. Fucking easy. Fuckn easy. Fuckin easy. Fucken easy.
[20:16.12]The louder you sing, the more the meter will fill?
[20:18.80]Alright, I'm going with it off for a minute.
[20:30.49]My whole desk just shook.
[21:12.05]Oh, that sucked.
[21:14.66]That sucked.
[21:20.08]That hurt so bad.

[22:37.27]Just ride the clock?
[22:42.95]Do a cat puke?
[23:36.31]It was a button.
[23:37.31]Yeah, I'm switching back and forth because it's gonna be really loud.
[23:41.33]I could actually just talk and it'll spin around and shit.
[23:43.99]That's fine.
[23:44.63]I have to hold the note.
[24:01.67]What time does
[24:23.93]I don't know.
[24:54.47]We're good.
[24:58.31]Hey.
[25:00.25]This game is 40 hours long?
[25:06.65]Jesus.
[25:06.99]What do I do with it?
[25:10.38]Oh, I have to knock it back up.
[25:14.30]Oh.
[25:16.28]Bah.
[25:26.97]What are you talking about?
[25:35.34]Yeah.
[25:35.50]We're good.
[25:41.24]This is... Wow.
[25:43.05]Uh...
[25:49.52]Singing is fucking hard.
[26:25.50]A bug on the screen?
[26:26.22]I thought that was a bug on my screen.
[26:28.34]A little gnat.
[26:30.11]Not scaring you.
[26:59.62]I'm gonna be speech jammed for the next, like, two, three hours.
[27:05.53]Duet desert?
[27:08.23]I sing duets?
[27:09.31]Flying around in this magical sky
[27:45.95]Get the fuck outta here.
[28:05.23]Get the fuck outta here!
[28:40.15]I wish you gave me the lyrics.
[28:41.19]Fucking help me!
[28:52.93]Y'all need some help here?
[29:14.54]High note is up, low note is down.
[29:19.05]Bring that up.
[29:22.11]Up.
[29:22.79]Down.
[29:25.03]Down.
[29:26.79]Up.
[29:26.89]Down.
[29:27.69]Up.
[29:40.23]Down.
[29:42.01]Down.
[30:14.04]not even trying I'm not gonna sing an entire song to get this thing to move up and down it's just well you should I can't I hear myself like three times
[30:42.55]Up, down, down.
[30:43.61]Up, down, down.
[30:46.38]What?
[31:13.24]Range.
[31:14.49]I don't know what this is.
[31:22.13]You can turn off the playback echo.
[31:24.59]I feel like that's important though.
[31:28.97]That's important.
[31:49.07]What if I did like halfway like this?
[31:50.47]I can still hear it though.
[31:51.29]I think it's important.
[31:56.59]Yeah, because I think that during the course of the game it records what I say and plays it back.
[32:03.39]I'm 99% sure that there's cases in this game where you won't be able to hear it.
[32:12.72]Yeah, it's important.
[32:13.70]It's got to stay.
[32:18.87]Use your webcam, Mike.
[32:21.11]Well, now I can't hear it now.
[32:24.98]Hello?
[32:25.78]Hello, hello, hello.
[32:26.40]What happened?
[32:29.34]Hello?
[32:29.94]There we go.
[32:38.36]It's important.
[32:38.88]Um...
[32:59.16]I'm not gonna use a webcam mic.
[33:01.50]Oh my, maybe I should.
[33:04.50]I'm very curious.
[33:05.62]What if I do that?
[33:07.20]We need to see what it's, I need to see.
[33:10.92]Give me one second.
[33:13.18]Oh, it's not gonna work.
[33:25.22]I don't have, this doesn't recognize it.
[33:33.81]What the?
[34:09.31]I don't know how to whistle.
[34:39.38]I don't get it.
[34:44.21]This thing doesn't, I can't do it.
[35:08.20]No, I'm not- She doesn't have any batteries.
[35:10.24]I turned it on too long.
[35:12.66]Alright, let's go.
[35:15.75]I can go.
[35:18.71]Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
[35:24.02]Up.
[35:39.61]No Shido is worse for him.
[35:44.13]Oh god.
[36:17.41]Let's go.
[36:35.26]Rip your vocal cords.
[36:38.48]I'll be alright.
[36:51.36]Did you warm up before this?
[36:52.44]Um, I think so.
[36:55.00]Kind of.
[36:57.02]Now what?
[36:59.70]Oh my god!
[37:24.33]Does it delay?
[37:25.15]Yeah, I know.
[37:30.75]That was bad.
[37:36.50]That was bad.
[37:37.46]I can't match that.
[37:38.72]That was bad.
[37:50.62]It works.
[37:51.80]It's okay.
[38:05.40]That's good.
[39:08.72]I was trying to go over that for no reason
[39:31.62]It's a roller coaster.
[39:33.72]I really am on a roller coaster.
[40:29.60]That could have been better, but it's okay.
[40:32.32]I think I have to hit the button.
[40:40.81]That was really loud, I'm sorry.
[41:00.65]That was really loud.
[41:01.59]That's why I have them both off.
[41:02.65]Oh, my God.
[41:13.62]It's going to be hard.
[41:44.25]Oh fuck, I did it wrong.
[41:48.17]How am I supposed to do this?
[42:14.19]We're good, I got it.
[42:18.53]Jerma, you look skinny.
[42:22.09]No, I'm like 170 pounds.
[42:22.71]I'm a fat fuck.
[44:01.28]That was close.
[44:03.22]That was a close one.
[44:07.04]Scream into the mic.
[44:08.12]Come on.
[44:52.99]stop making me laugh you're making me laugh
[45:25.54]People talk about I'm skinny.
[45:27.18]I'm 5'7", 170 pounds.
[45:29.96]That's- that's not o- that's not- that's overweight.
[45:33.14]That's actually fucking overweight.
[45:34.76]Yeah, I'm not 6'2".
[45:38.59]I'm literally 5'7 1⁄2".
[45:40.41]And yes, I may be a little overweight.
[45:45.45]Eeeeee...
[46:03.75]With fresh shoes?
[46:04.85]Yeah, I don't have fresh shoes.
[46:08.13]I can't get up.
[46:44.48]Imagine this with multiplayer.
[47:01.61]It'd be insane.
[47:07.19]Now what?
[47:11.76]Okay.
[47:15.49]This person hasn't done anything.
[47:16.73]Okay.
[47:23.30]Oh shit.
[47:45.40]What?
[47:48.68]It shows how flat I am.
[48:20.90]One, two, three, four.
[48:23.46]Five.
[48:49.59]Because I have a... What are you talking about?
[48:52.01]What does that even mean?
[48:54.43]What does that mean?
[48:56.93]It looks like I got out of prison.
[49:01.81]Why?
[49:02.86]Dude, you're tone deaf.
[49:04.16]I'm not tone deaf.
[49:05.36]I'm not tone deaf.
[49:24.63]This is a great way to practice.
[49:27.03]Honest to god.
[49:30.36]You know how hard it is to stay in front of the audience?
[49:41.10]This is fucking hard.
[49:42.48]It's difficult.
[49:45.31]Is that what he said?
[49:46.97]Bjork?
[49:47.23]Is that what he said?
[49:48.79]Bjork?
[49:52.42]What do you mean Bjork?
[49:54.32]I don't sound like Bjork.
[49:55.74]What do you mean?
[49:58.08]Fucking Bjork?
[49:59.30]I can't.
[49:59.84]That sounds... I'm not obsessed with Bjork.
[50:07.69]I don't know who Bjork is.
[50:47.41]Fucking Bjork.
[50:50.71]Now you fucked the whole thing up.
[50:52.39]The whole thing is fucked up now.

[51:00.23]Push your Adam's apple up?
[51:01.59]That hurts.
[51:29.86]That's all I hear right now.
[51:31.30]I don't have anything else but Björk.
[51:34.27]I'm actually fucking losing it.
[51:58.06]All I think of, all I can think of is like... That's all I hear.
[52:10.03]That's all I hear in my head.
[52:11.67]And then somebody says Bjork, and I'm like, fuck!
[52:24.34]Oh, I hear like .

[53:57.45]Not a computer.
[53:58.91]I can't hear anything.
[54:03.26]I didn't mean to say computer.
[54:05.68]I meant to say... I meant to say a fucking coffee cup.
[54:14.23]I meant to say a coffee cup.
[54:21.75]I'm being speech jammed.
[54:23.98]You don't understand.
[54:28.32]Fucking Bjork.
[54:29.40]I need to clean this up.
[54:31.98]It's everywhere.
[54:34.33]I gotta take this out.
[54:35.93]Not a computer, a coffee cup.
[54:38.31]I have a coffee cup here that I just spit into.
[54:42.73]Do you want to see?
[54:43.99]Look.
[54:44.99]This is a coffee cup that I just spit everything into.
[54:48.37]No, I don't have like a brown computer.
[54:50.49]That coffee was in here earlier, but not
[54:57.42]That's coffee, it's not puke, I'm trying to puke.
[55:03.28]What did that sound like, I need to know.
[55:12.45]Yeah, I'll take some, just toss it.
[55:32.75]Stop chewing tobacco.
[55:37.38]It's not chewing tobacco.
[55:40.18]You fucking weirdo.
[56:19.94]You know, turn this shit off for a second.
[56:22.14]All I hear in my head is just Bjork and that person ruined the whole stream.
[56:34.52]You fucking idiot.
[56:41.06]I don't even know what happened.
[56:42.26]I don't remember what happened.
[56:44.82]I need a clip.
[56:45.64]I don't remember what just happened.
[56:48.42]I started choking.
[56:49.92]I puked into a coffee cup.
[56:52.96]What happened?
[56:55.78]I don't even know why that happened.
[56:56.98]Did he just puke?
[57:17.52]Can you hear it?
[57:19.33]Hold on.
[57:19.61]Do you actually hear the puke sounds?
[57:22.59]No, you don't.
[57:26.71]Wait a second.
[57:29.16]You don't actually hear it, do you?
[57:38.15]No.
[57:59.50]toilet bowl no I didn't puke I just I spit what was in my mouth okay no I didn't actually puke
[58:27.48]I... I... had... That does look like I actually threw up.
[58:32.58]You don't see me.
[58:33.28]I put... I drank another sip.
[58:35.58]What the fuck?
[58:36.43]It actually is like I puked.
[58:39.33]Alright, let's go.
[58:46.07]We lost a thousand viewers during this, by the way.
[58:49.05]I think... I think two thousand people left in the last, like, fifteen minutes.
[58:53.33]No, I didn't puke.
[58:54.45]I spit what was in my mouth.
[59:00.50]Okay.
[59:02.28]This is clean.
[59:04.34]Viewer is plummeting.
[59:10.98]Somebody just said, I'm close to leaving.
[59:14.99]Right.
[59:15.25]Alright.
[59:15.59]Alright.
[59:16.01]Fucking stop.
[59:16.89]Enough.
[59:17.19]Enough.
[59:17.43]Enough.
[59:17.61]Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[59:27.75]Are you ready?
[59:38.96]I just did like a curly laugh from the Three Stooges.
[59:41.00]Fuck you!
[59:42.12]Fucking goddamn Bjork is in my head again.
[59:44.95]Alright, you ready?
[59:45.59]Let's go.
[60:04.82]What the fuck happened?
[60:06.20]I didn't make that noise!
[60:34.28]I need to recover this stream.
[60:38.02]I have to recover, I have to get back in control.
[61:20.46]oh oh
[62:09.20]I lost it.
[62:10.50]Here we go.
[63:00.06]I'm going to leave my box about this play out.
[63:31.34]You came here because I'm perfect.
[63:50.59]Why are you embarrassed to sing?
[63:52.11]You were in a diaper in a slime dream.
[63:55.97]It's different.
[64:06.20]so
[65:28.09]Oh.
[65:28.87]Oh.
[65:29.49]Oh.
[66:02.20]Oh.
[66:34.03]Somebody said 100 guests.
[66:35.87]Stop naming musicians that aren't me.
[66:40.19]Stop naming people that aren't me.
[66:49.10]Stop.
[66:55.24]You're not a musician.
[66:56.30]Oh, OK.
[67:00.48]Sure about that?
[67:16.14]You sure about that?
[67:22.97]Get the fuck out of here.
[67:28.86]Ban them.
[67:47.01]Imagine raging at a game like this.
[67:51.29]I was about to punch the microphone.
[67:53.55]I was going to punch the microphone.
[68:29.09]I quit.
[68:30.65]I quit.
[68:32.09]I quit.
[68:34.83]Nice temper tantrum, adult.
[69:01.65]That was really fun.
[69:04.85]We're gonna play something else.
[69:31.28]Let me try it without the headphones in.
[70:06.14]Fuck this dork, give us Bjork.
[70:12.15]Fuck this dork, give us Bjork.
[70:14.97]Bjork is 100,000 times more talented than I will ever be in my whole life.
[70:19.41]So I can understand that sentiment.
[70:31.74]So where do we go now?
[70:32.64]Vampire Survivors?
[70:39.59]Go back to Wheel of Fortune.
[70:41.13]Wheel of Fortune?
[70:43.71]I could turn on Wheel of Fortune.
[70:50.89]Yeah.
[70:51.81]Okay.
[70:52.33]We'll do Wheel of Fortune for like an hour or so.
[70:56.51]Okay.
[70:56.93]Yeah.
[70:59.81]Give me one sec.
[71:04.10]Change in game.
[71:05.58]And change in console.
[71:08.92]That was really cute.
[71:10.04]These two games were actually really cool.
[71:14.63]Something different.
[71:15.29]Something interesting.
[71:25.77]I've actually been sitting on those games for a little while, so.
[71:31.58]The coolest part about that, that was one-handed clapping.
[71:34.20]Oh, one-hand clapping, by the way.
[71:36.77]uh that was the fact that you can see in real time you probably could train your voice pretty well alright I'll be right back I'm gonna get the wheel of fortune set up because it's on the switch so I'm gonna get that set up I'll be right back
[72:09.10]Just kidding.
[72:10.90]Now I'll be right back.
[72:24.12]I guess I don't really have to even go anywhere, do I?
[72:28.89]I'm trying to capture the switch right now.
[72:30.77]Which can be finicky.
[72:34.27]Give me one sec.
[72:43.05]Where is it?
[72:52.35]Where is it?
[72:56.51]It should be capturing it.
[72:57.35]I don't know why it's not.
[73:03.04]My capture card can be really weird, though, for some reason.
[73:06.44]It just doesn't want to capture it.
[73:11.14]Oh, hold on.
[73:12.94]Hold on.
[73:14.74]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[73:16.25]I know you can do it.
[73:18.37]Come on.
[73:23.78]Come on.
[73:24.20]What do you mean no signal?
[73:25.92]Oh, I took the HDMI out of the back.
[73:27.72]Alright, actually BRB.
