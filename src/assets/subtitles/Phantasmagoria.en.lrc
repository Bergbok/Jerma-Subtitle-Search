[00:57.99]Like this new intro song?
[01:08.84]This is like the Phantasmagoria theme song.
[01:11.22]I don't even know what it means.
[01:13.60]It's probably like ghosts.
[01:18.64]Who knows?
[01:21.29]Okay, hi.
[01:22.71]No.
[01:23.85]We're gonna close him off.
[01:25.66]We're gonna bring this back.
[01:27.72]Hi.
[01:29.44]Welcome, everybody.
[01:32.60]Welcome to Thursday.
[01:34.46]Gonna be playing Phantasmagoria.
[01:36.12]I don't know how long we're gonna play.
[01:37.08]Look, I got like, like I told you yesterday.
[01:39.91]I got a lot of random fucking games.
[01:42.59]Some of them are gonna be instantly done.
[01:44.43]And some of them are gonna take like brain power.
[01:47.15]Which, I don't wanna do that.
[01:49.38]You know, who wants to use their brain?
[01:51.10]No brain power video games.
[01:52.77]If I have to, like, combine a rope with the end of an easel and then break off a pipe and make, uh, accommodate those items to make, like, a key to open one door, we're not gonna do it.
[02:03.83]But at least we'll try.
[02:04.99]You know, we'll try.
[02:07.37]Make sure my, uh, my Twitter thing went through.
[02:11.58]It did.
[02:15.00]Fresh soda!
[02:21.98]Adult server.
[02:24.26]Because we're in this fucking Halloween spirit.
[02:26.84]We only got four more- five more days until Halloween.
[02:32.82]Gonna be scary tonight.
[02:39.14]Well, let's go.
[02:41.06]Or should I wait?
[02:41.68]I mean, I don't know how long we're gonna be in this for.
[02:43.03]This is probably like an intro.
[02:44.61]Okay, let's just turn this down.
[02:48.29]I'll just show you the screen.
[02:49.47]Let's click it.
[02:51.80]Here's Phantasmagoria.
[02:55.50]Hopefully the volume is at a good enough level.
[02:58.95]I think it is.
[03:02.77]What the fuck is this?
[03:11.78]I'm probably playing like Satanist music in the background of my stream.
[03:18.72]Whatever that may be.
[03:20.83]It's time to go.
[03:22.69]We're gonna watch the intro movie.
[03:25.13]Happy Halloween.
[03:28.73]Hey.
[03:29.89]Happy Halloween, everybody.
[03:31.87]Hopefully that didn't just break everything.
[03:34.05]It may have.
[03:35.60]If it did, please let me know.
[03:37.28]Watch intro.
[03:40.28]Bob Ross painted this!
[03:44.90]Wait, it actually is gonna be a painting.
[03:49.70]Is he going to paint?
[03:50.48]Hold on.
[03:50.82]Is this guy going to paint the painting that's behind him that's clearly a green screen?
[03:55.23]He is, isn't he?
[03:56.77]No, he's going to take a picture of the painting, the big backdrop.
[04:02.31]He's getting his camera equipment together.
[04:03.57]This is just primitive technology, but not.
[04:10.36]Yeah.
[04:11.98]Snapping picture of the house, of the school, and of this scary mansion.
[04:16.68]Okay.
[04:19.17]Oh, wait, your camera's capable of doing that?
[04:23.27]Alright, this guy's camera is capable of going inside of this building.
[04:32.32]This is a pretty state-of-the-art camera.
[04:33.82]Keep going, whatever, like 900,000 optical zoom.
[04:36.24]We already heard this song.
[04:49.77]Oh, God.
[04:50.53]What kind of camera can it be?
[04:56.37]I think this guy took drugs before he zoomed in.
[05:00.69]Electric chair.
[05:05.20]Oh, this is a bad dream.
[05:07.42]Oh, shit.
[05:08.32]I didn't buy that camera on Amazon when it went on sale.
[05:11.42]On Morbid Monday.
[05:15.74]What the fuck?
[05:17.99]No, that was just a second dream.
[05:19.65]Oh, God.
[05:20.11]What happened, honey?
[05:20.81]I dreamed I didn't buy the game on Amazon.
[05:23.21]Alright, you know what I'm saying.
[05:30.04]That was horrible.
[05:32.48]We have to listen.
[05:39.06]Is there any nudity?
[05:43.57]You don't have her.
[05:50.72]I hope she wakes up from this dream.
[05:53.54]Oh shit, no nudity, no sex please.
[05:55.88]I didn't read the reviews.
[05:58.44]Oh god damn it, there is!
[06:00.14]There is!
[06:01.36]Just, hold on, wait, get off the screen!
[06:05.00]Oh shit, I fucked it up.
[06:06.76]I broke everything.
[06:09.37]Oh god damn it, I just broke the stream.
[06:16.85]Oh shit, no, they were just hugging.
[06:19.38]They were hugging in bed.
[06:20.66]That's all that was going on.
[06:21.72]Nothing else happened.
[06:24.82]You didn't see shit.
[06:26.07]Look.
[06:26.93]See, we're back here.
[06:35.77]That was, they were just lying in bed.
[06:37.33]They were having a conversation and then like he had an itch on his back and she like grabbed her arms around him to try to get the itch on her, on his back.
[06:46.66]That's all that happened.
[06:49.68]And he looked like he was asphyxiating, so she had to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to him.
[06:53.84]That's exactly what happened.
[07:01.30]Alright, let's go.
[07:01.88]Name your game.
[07:04.88]Banned seven minutes into it.
[07:06.41]No, we're fine.
[07:07.17]Look, you didn't see anything.
[07:08.35]That was like going to the store and seeing somebody with a bikini on.
[07:16.33]Okay, which chapter?
[07:17.57]Chapter one, obviously.
[07:24.96]Alright, we're fine.
[07:26.34]Chapter 1, Sunday, October 16th at 9am.
[07:28.82]Alright, is there any nudity in this game for real?
[07:39.09]Like, forget about, like, fake nudity.
[07:41.89]Who's played this?
[07:42.65]Is there real, like, actual nudity in this game?
[07:45.25]Am I gonna get a deep shit for playing this?
[07:53.53]This whole game is not safe for work.
[07:55.47]Is it really?
[07:56.21]Yeah, big one.
[07:56.61]What's with this voice?
[07:57.27]Do I realize how graphic this game is?
[08:01.28]Is it actually that graphic?
[08:02.82]I have to admit, this place is kind of strange.
[08:21.43]Yeah, it's different.
[08:22.77]You know, I bet the guy that built this place must have been really bizarre.
[08:26.07]Yeah.
[08:27.51]Well, hi, Spad.
[08:28.90]Here's a cat.
[08:34.22]This whole game is a bad porno.
[08:35.70]Oh, God.
[08:36.08]Well, I don't know.
[08:39.18]I'm almost finished unpacking.
[08:40.42]I thought maybe I'd do a little exploring.
[08:42.96]How about you?
[08:44.18]Do you see that bathroom yet on the second floor?
[08:47.33]Do people still smoke in their houses?
[08:48.59]I like that.

[10:14.08]Ah, here we go.

[11:31.78]Anyone who laughs like this... Ha ha ha.
[11:36.36]That's not a real laugh.
[11:38.54]I'm going to see right through that.
[11:40.17]Here's how you actually are supposed to laugh.
[11:42.53]Like, you know, you laugh like it's actually you think something's funny.
[11:45.53]You don't put breath out.
[11:47.51]You don't like exhale while you're laughing.
[11:49.60]That's very clearly fake.
[11:53.54]That's a fake laugh.
[12:00.90]Get it fucking right.
[12:01.96]Hire me.
[12:03.02]I am the official hint keeper.
[12:06.20]I watch your every move.
[12:08.84]Ask me for a hint if you are hopelessly stuck.
[12:12.08]But use me sparingly.
[12:14.20]Too many hints can spoil the game.
[12:17.40]This is clearly the dev.
[12:18.42]What do we do here?
[12:19.64]How do I move?
[12:19.96]That's how you stand up.
[12:31.19]I can go like, okay, let's look over here on the dresser.
[12:38.86]This is a bunch of crumpled up paper.
[12:40.06]Are those matches?
[12:43.60]I did uncensor it.
[12:44.52]Well, I mean, whatever.
[12:47.45]Look, I'm quick enough where I can hit the escape key and censor it.
[12:52.45]Don't worry.
[12:52.89]That's not going to happen.
[12:56.19]I'm going to sit back down.
[12:57.04]Get up.
[13:04.66]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:06.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:12.17]Alright.
[13:13.13]So, somebody just gave me some good advice.
[13:17.01]Hold on a minute.
[13:23.76]Okay.
[13:25.22]This one specific item, I ain't fucking clicking.
[13:27.74]So, okay.
[13:29.54]Good to know.
[13:33.92]Oh, shit, Spencer.
[13:38.26]We actually have, like, Twitch staff in here now.
[13:40.77]Like, they're hanging out in here.
[13:41.71]They're waiting for me to make a mistake.
[13:44.45]That's what they're doing, guys.
[13:45.27]Like, Spencer's here waiting for me to make a mistake.
[13:49.59]He probably got wind of this and he's like, oh, shit, I better get ready.
[13:52.85]Yeah.
[13:52.99]Alright, well, I got matches.
[13:56.60]Anything else to do?
[13:57.28]I'm going to leave.
[14:01.72]Oh, boy.
[14:02.38]Okay, what is this?
[14:04.66]Delight.
[14:06.80]Cans.
[14:10.56]Can I click on the cans?
[14:13.60]No, I'm looking under the rug.
[14:19.09]Nice rug.
[14:19.65]There's a trap door down here.
[14:21.33]Okay.
[14:26.35]Looks like we're going in the trap door.
[14:30.95]She has excellent posture.
[14:31.99]She really does.
[14:34.02]That can't be open.
[14:34.54]I'm going to have to get a thing to pry that open with.
[14:40.33]We can't.
[14:40.71]We currently can't.
[14:41.43]We currently can't open that.
[14:43.77]So we can't go.
[14:44.27]Remember this?
[14:44.68]We just have to pry that open with.
[14:49.18]Alright, let's go down here.
[14:53.80]We have our kitchen system here.
[14:58.99]Alright, come on, click it.
[15:00.19]No, no, no, no.
[15:00.75]Don't sit back down in the chair, you stupid.
[15:02.97]Get up.
[15:04.51]I don't want to sit there.
[15:05.38]Get up.
[15:05.68]Go over here.
[15:06.76]Stand back up.
[15:10.66]Be careful.
[15:12.74]I'm going to be very careful.
[15:14.08]Look, I've already been told what to avoid.
[15:17.14]Let's go over here.
[15:22.98]Alright, we got a fire.
[15:25.34]Make sure I like Joffrey up there.
[15:27.32]Or Cersei, whoever it is.
[15:36.06]Fire.
[15:39.97]If I'm worried about explicit content, your channel shouldn't play this.
[15:42.59]I'm not worried about explicit content.
[15:44.01]I'm worried about, like, extreme content.
[15:47.59]I'm not worried at all.
[15:50.54]We're going to be fine.
[15:51.64]Look, I can open the trapdoor now.
[15:53.82]It's Halloween.
[15:55.96]It's Halloween.
[15:56.36]We're going to be fine.
[16:01.65]Incoming extreme content.
[16:05.76]Mirror, Cersei Lannister is currently looking at us.
[16:12.39]I'm more scared of like... What is extreme content?
[16:17.91]I don't... I'm taking a long time admiring this mirror.
[16:28.14]Don't ask me why.
[16:32.61]Alright, that was a very long time.
[16:34.23]Alright, what about like matches?
[16:38.89]No, I don't think I can do anything else here.
[16:42.54]No.
[16:43.78]Okay, let's turn around.
[16:45.76]Should I fire poke?
[16:50.70]I'm just gonna poke the fire.
[16:54.46]Is that a bad idea?
[17:00.15]So far, this is a real boring cold winter's night simulator.
[17:05.84]How about this way?
[17:11.42]This is just going outside.
[17:17.60]This is a very strange game so far.
[17:20.42]I feel like I'm playing inside of mist.
[17:27.91]We're going to walk over here.
[17:31.79]Let's keep going across the bridge.
[17:33.25]I'm like the fucking Wizard of Oz right now.
[17:42.92]Should I go in the car?
[17:43.78]I'm getting in the car.
[17:51.40]I'm going to- I'm driving the car.
[17:56.28]Where the hell am I?
[18:07.06]Uh... Okay.
[18:10.22]Let's keep going.
[18:12.70]Is this just, like, toonstruck?
[18:16.02]Alright, we're gonna go into the realty place.
[18:21.06]Smash this window with the crowbar.
[18:25.54]Am I actually gonna do that?
[18:26.58]I don't know.
[18:28.02]It's an open world point-and-click, like, extreme content game.
[18:37.21]Can I go in here?
[18:37.79]That was not the noise I would expect to hear.
[18:50.24]Closed.
[18:52.80]Okay.
[18:54.62]Is there anything good to know?
[18:56.84]I'm so scared right now.
[18:59.24]Oh, there's a guy.
[18:59.78]There's a guy.
[19:00.36]Okay, guy.
[19:00.92]There's a guy and a dog.
[19:07.36]Hey, fella.
[19:09.04]Oh, look at that dog.
[19:17.18]Dog.
[19:19.24]I'm never going to get over that opening scene, am I?
[19:21.26]How come I can't talk to this guy?
[19:26.18]Creepy guy just walked by.
[19:32.18]No stores are open.
[19:36.18]Like a scary guy just walked by.
[19:37.90]That's all I know.
[19:40.62]So is there any reason for me to do any of this?
[19:44.80]Alright, well there's a new door.
[19:46.44]Nope.
[19:48.60]Why is it just dogs?
[19:52.88]These are very clearly audio clips of a dog.
[20:03.63]When they use the same clip...
[20:09.52]Let's take their mail.
[20:11.86]It's okay.
[20:12.56]Good dog.
[20:13.00]I just wanted to steal my neighbor's mail.
[20:15.70]Mr. Malcolm Wormshadow.
[20:18.67]Well, this is Massachusetts.
[20:19.79]No wonder this fucking game is messed up.
[20:26.01]No wonder this game is fucked up.
[20:31.36]I think I need to remember that.
[20:40.23]I'm just kidding.
[20:40.83]I would never do that.
[20:43.24]What did it say?
[20:43.70]I don't even... What did it say?
[20:45.02]It said something else.
[20:46.30]Wait.
[20:49.02]Alright, get the fuck out of here.
[20:52.36]Time to go home.
[20:53.54]We had fun petting the dogs.
[20:54.88]It's time to go home.
[21:01.23]Alright, back it up.
[21:05.95]She's making sure her hands are on ten and two.
[21:08.61]That's safe.
[21:14.13]No, we can't next until... We have to watch one person die.
[21:18.37]It's Halloween.
[21:19.35]It's scary.
[21:21.41]Once we get to see the one person die, we will go to the next game.
[21:29.44]That might take a minute or two, but look, we got all night.
[21:39.90]My driver's edis course was 9 and 3.
[21:48.58]Well, we have a new cutscene.
[21:59.96]Let's keep walking over here.
[22:01.00]There's another member of the Lannister family.
[22:04.44]I don't know who that is.
[22:06.86]Wait, what was this?
[22:07.80]There's something over here.
[22:14.38]Do I have any coins?
[22:18.48]Oh, I'm gonna get my tarot read.
[22:25.08]Okay.
[22:29.01]Everyone get ready for, like, this spike to come out.
[22:31.19]You're not even a real actor.
[22:34.31]Okay.
[22:45.64]It's a porn machine.
[22:46.72]It's gonna flip over like- That's it.
[22:53.44]Oh.
[22:54.04]Evil will walk once more.
[22:57.54]What a terrible machine.
[23:00.90]Anything on the back?
[23:02.16]No.
[23:03.74]It's a porn dispenser.
[23:04.86]Yeah, please take your porn card.
[23:06.82]Would you like- How much porn would you like?
[23:12.55]Porn dispenser.
[23:16.91]Look, maybe we should have, like, the funny skull tell us, like, a hint.
[23:20.48]Exploration is knowledge.
[23:24.72]That was a really good hint.
[23:30.00]Good, great hint.
[23:34.35]Alright, play the piano.
[23:36.67]What kind of piano has a hand crank?
[23:38.03]What?
[23:38.33]What is this?
[23:50.00]Yeah, everybody make sure you have like your parents permission to be here.
[23:55.66]Is that gonna open the door or something?
[23:59.83]What else is over here?
[24:00.53]Alright, we got like an alcohol.
[24:08.45]Some kind of... Some kind of bourbon.
[24:11.73]Or is it blood?
[24:14.95]Hmm, what do I feel like I don't think I've been a gin mood that gin makes me gassy Hmm, not that but I think I want absinthe of course.
[24:23.51]It's absinthe of course it is Why would it be anything else besides absinthe?
[24:35.17]She goes right for the absinthe we know what kind of girl she is she's crazy I
[24:43.47]Don't go right for the absinthe.
[24:45.13]Ever.
[24:45.97]In fact, don't ever have it.
[24:46.81]Don't ever drink it.
[24:48.49]Don't do it.
[24:50.71]Stick with regular-ass fucking alcohol.
[24:58.61]We get it.
[24:58.95]You can't open the door.
[25:01.39]It took you that long to figure that out.
[25:02.75]Ah, damn it.
[25:03.23]It's locked.
[25:05.47]So I can no longer interact with that.
[25:06.78]Let's... Hold on.
[25:10.06]What else is over here?
[25:13.92]Looks like we're going this way.
[25:18.68]Click the skull.
[25:23.54]Get out of the game.
[25:24.58]I'm getting so many warnings.
[25:29.06]I'm telling you, I'm ready.
[25:30.22]I'm ready.
[25:31.42]I'm in full-on protection mode.
[25:33.88]What about over here?
[25:38.30]Okay.
[25:39.22]I'm not clicking this.
[25:41.79]I'm not touching anything in here.
[25:43.61]In fact, leave.
[25:45.81]Get out.
[25:46.83]Go this way.
[25:50.43]Oh, shit.
[25:50.95]Which one is it?
[25:51.71]Which is the bed I'm not supposed to click on?
[25:57.88]Somebody told me to avoid the bed.
[25:59.34]There's like a bunch of beds everywhere.
[26:00.90]Look at this fucking grandfather magician.
[26:06.07]Oh, my dear.
[26:06.57]Which Lannister is this?
[26:12.27]Any of them.
[26:15.75]Oh god.
[26:17.07]I'm so scared of the next cutscene that happens.
[26:21.15]This is actually what I would imagine a magician's bedroom would look like.
[26:27.90]Does that mean I can't sit on any of the stuff?
[26:31.62]What about this?
[26:32.08]Is this a bed too?
[26:37.14]What would you guys consider to be like a bed?
[26:40.24]Why would I be sitting on all these?
[26:44.85]Damn it.
[26:49.37]There's something over there.
[26:56.15]What am I?
[26:56.85]What is this?
[26:57.33]Should I open this book?
[27:02.14]What is that?
[27:03.22]A jewelry?
[27:03.72]A piece of jewelry?
[27:04.64]A diamond?
[27:07.96]Danger.
[27:08.50]Danger.
[27:08.96]Danger.
[27:16.92]Everything is so interactable, but it seems like you can't do much.
[27:20.14]Like, with picking up things.
[27:25.54]Alright, what's here?
[27:28.73]This looks like... Oh god, somebody came to the door.
[27:31.67]I'm ready.
[27:33.15]Cigarettes?
[27:33.53]Three cigarettes?
[27:35.12]Cigarettes?
[27:44.71]Yeah, why am I just wandering around a magician's house?
[27:46.93]I don't know.
[27:48.15]That's a good question.
[27:51.89]No, no.
[27:52.75]I'm leaving.
[27:55.27]Just like I don't click on links, I don't click on beds.
[27:59.24]This is the equivalent of somebody sending me a bit.ly link.
[28:02.90]I ain't gonna fucking click it.
[28:04.36]This is a bit.ly bed.
[28:05.66]I ain't clicking on it.
[28:07.88]It's been confirmed.
[28:09.82]Somebody else has to find out what it is.
[28:17.28]Okay, alright, we got our first victim.
[28:19.32]Am I the murderer?
[28:24.76]No, I didn't click on a bed.
[28:28.19]I didn't even click a bed.
[28:29.15]Oh, he cut his hand.
[28:33.25]Drain cleaner.
[28:35.65]Drain cleaner.
[28:52.18]Look at this fucking weird house.
[28:54.20]Wait, this is our house?
[28:56.52]Where's he going?
[29:03.35]What happens if I turn the water on?
[29:09.53]Something bad's gonna happen.
[29:15.35]Obviously, like, a safe is gonna land on his head, right?
[29:19.67]Gonna be some drain cleaner.
[29:24.59]I can't interact with anything.
[29:25.51]Wait.
[29:25.91]I guess, like, wait.
[29:26.51]Hold on.
[29:28.45]He's gonna say it again, right?
[29:29.29]Give me some drain cleaner.
[29:32.01]Turn that box upside down.
[29:42.32]So, this is just, like, bored girl simulator for the first, like, it seems like 30 minutes of this game.
[29:50.78]Drain cleaner.
[29:56.41]What?
[29:57.01]Okay, hold on a minute.
[29:58.11]What is that?
[29:59.69]What is that thing?
[30:02.43]I don't know what that is.
[30:03.71]What is this?
[30:05.29]Does that count as a bed?
[30:12.81]I think that counts as a bed.
[30:18.88]So, what about that suit of armor over here?
[30:26.19]I love how it's apparently more safe for me to click on the bondage chair than it is for me to click on the bed Is that what my understanding is?
[30:42.58]I'm getting ready Okay
[30:54.48]That's it?
[30:55.50]Okay, well, we're safe.
[30:56.66]I'm actually, like, nervous.
[31:00.09]I'm so scared of the outcome.
[31:02.01]Alright, so I have to, like, turn that off, apparently.
[31:06.95]Yeah, I just had sex with that bolt of lightning.
[31:11.49]Oh, looks like we're going up the stairs.
[31:20.16]We just gotta get to, like, the first... Somebody has to, like, explode, and then we're gonna get out of here.
[31:29.86]It's locked.
[31:32.46]Yes, we know it's locked.
[31:38.08]Am I looking through?
[31:40.88]I'm seeing another door.
[31:42.50]Why there's a key stuck in the keyhole.
[31:45.10]Well, there's a key stuck in the keyhole.
[31:47.14]So pull it out.
[31:49.60]Go get some tweezers and get it out of there.
[31:51.20]Go get a pair of scissors and some tweezers.
[31:52.72]Go get like a paper clip and get it out.
[32:01.43]Oh, teddy bear.
[32:02.02]Uh, we're gonna go this way.
[32:07.78]Alright, uh... Does Dr. Seuss live in this fucking house?
[32:13.22]Because if not, then no one else owns this shower.
[32:18.15]Everything is possible to be fucking lewd.
[32:19.93]Really.
[32:24.61]Click the wrong thing, someone's gonna get, like, naked.
[32:31.82]How would you even get... This is just going to spray onto the floor.
[32:36.24]What does the toilet look like?
[32:38.54]Oh, shit.
[32:40.62]Oh, shit.
[32:42.42]Did I do that?
[32:42.92]Is this going to be... Okay.
[33:08.38]Is that it?
[33:08.90]You got any more in there?
[33:13.64]So the first sound was not the toilet flushing.
[33:18.18]Why would you flush the toilet and then go to the bathroom?
[33:22.55]I don't know.
[33:22.97]I don't know.
[33:38.73]Oh, look, a TV.
[33:39.49]Why don't we turn on the TV?
[33:41.07]What's on TV?
[33:43.37]Oh, this just did.
[33:44.15]Serial killer.
[33:45.83]Another bitly link.
[33:52.10]Is this bitly link telling me I can get a free iPhone if I click it?
[34:01.92]Money.
[34:03.22]Nice.
[34:03.76]I got one red money.
[34:08.80]Alright, should we- should we- alright, what do you think guys?
[34:11.29]I don't know, do I- do I attempt to get the free iPhone?
[34:14.21]Nope, not even a free iPhone available here.
[34:17.17]But there is an old computer.
[34:19.13]Ah, look, let me- like, here comes the porn on the computer.
[34:22.01]Make your, like, internet- I guess not.
[34:31.58]We know where you're from, the fucking Midwest.
[34:36.12]Somebody- so this is her bedroom, okay.
[34:39.26]Anything else in here I can do?
[34:45.01]There's no option here.
[34:49.29]You know what?
[34:50.15]I'm going to be honest with you guys.
[34:52.62]That's a pretty nice computer for it being like 1993.
[34:54.94]What else am I supposed to do?
[35:09.25]And by the way, that's very not safe for the computer.
[35:12.27]Alright, found like the baby's room.
[35:15.03]I guess we have a baby.
[35:20.45]Oh, no!
[35:23.15]Not the teddy bear.
[35:25.48]Is that supposed to be like bad?
[35:27.30]Is that the gore they were referring to?
[35:33.26]Oh, jeez.
[35:36.53]Why wouldn't you just, like, put it away?
[35:39.78]It's, like, creepy.
[35:42.06]The room's not done.
[35:42.78]Let's see.
[35:43.08]Keep going.
[35:45.24]Alright.
[35:46.74]There's more over here.
[35:47.92]I don't know what that is.
[35:51.68]What's this thing swirling around here?
[35:55.07]What is that?
[35:56.95]There's a random, like, fucking sad cloud over the baby's crib.
[36:04.59]Should I put some money into this?
[36:09.93]God, what is this?
[36:14.68]Now my hand is magic.
[36:19.50]She just wipes it.
[36:20.18]I'm just gonna wipe it off.
[36:21.76]Yeah, whatever.
[36:22.56]I got like weird fucking magic cloud goo on me.
[36:25.30]I'm gonna wipe it on my shirt.
[36:28.13]Let's like light it on fire.
[36:31.01]No, don't light the crib on fire.
[36:32.67]Fuck.
[36:34.63]Someone in town holds the key.
[36:37.19]Oh, come on.
[36:38.21]I was just there.
[36:42.03]I have to go into town.
[36:43.27]That's great.
[36:48.92]Is this like an iPad game?
[36:50.24]Am I going to run out of hints and have to pay for them?
[36:53.34]Time to go back to town.
[36:57.64]I do have money now, though.
[36:58.96]I can pay for something in town.
[37:03.81]I'm going to get lost.
[37:04.79]I know it.
[37:07.87]Let's go this way.
[37:08.61]Let's just teleport around.
[37:13.57]Okay.
[37:17.21]Okay.
[37:21.43]That was completely necessary.
[37:23.05]I'm glad we got to see it.
[37:33.37]Alright.
[37:35.75]I did not... Did I look over here?
[37:36.95]I don't want to have to do all this shit again.
[37:38.71]Okay.
[37:39.19]I looked at the absinthe.
[37:40.88]This door doesn't open.
[37:43.72]So let's just go back.
[37:45.56]I'm glad you can skip cuts.
[37:46.98]Like, you can skip the shit that you don't want to see.
[37:48.68]Like, I can skip.
[37:49.76]See?
[37:50.16]Like, skip.
[37:51.55]Perfect.
[37:52.59]What about over here?
[37:53.29]Skip.
[37:55.35]Back to the yellow brick road?
[37:56.83]Skip.
[37:59.29]Uh, let me go- Oh, I'm gonna pry that thing open.
[38:02.83]Where the hell am I?
[38:03.51]What is- I just- I went to, like, a new zone.
[38:08.26]What is this?
[38:08.92]Oh, Jesus.
[38:11.84]How do you save- Does the game save-
[38:20.89]How do I save the game?
[38:22.95]Okay, this is how.
[38:24.47]Save.
[38:27.19]Move it to the current location.
[38:28.75]Okay, there we go.
[38:30.11]That would have been a nightmare.
[38:31.99]Can I go down this hill?
[38:37.55]She's not going to fall in, is she?
[38:38.73]I could make that.
[38:48.90]I'm certain I could make that, but whatever.
[38:50.72]It's not me.
[38:52.12]Not everybody is in peak physical condition.
[38:57.02]Alright, let's go back.
[38:57.62]Let's go to the car.
[38:58.96]Let's go back to town.
[38:59.80]And find the guy that I need to give this money to.
[39:07.68]Get in.
[39:09.92]Welcome to this... I didn't even read the sign.
[39:13.22]It's too late.
[39:13.88]Alright, get in there.
[39:15.10]Someone in town I have to pay...
[39:17.83]Certain amount of money.
[39:18.51]What about in here?
[39:19.33]I didn't go this way.
[39:21.13]No, did I?
[39:21.61]No.
[39:21.77]Yeah, yeah.
[39:22.41]This is the house with the... Can I get the dog money?
[39:28.02]Back it up.
[39:28.68]Back in town.
[39:33.08]Alright.
[39:33.62]This guy.
[39:34.32]Why can I not talk to this guy?
[39:35.88]None of the stores are open.
[39:38.98]There's another nameless, faceless person.
[39:44.33]Pro tip.
[39:44.83]Money can be exchanged for goods.
[39:52.48]How do I... Somebody in town holds the key.
[39:55.07]Okay, that's fine.
[39:56.41]Oh, it's open.
[39:56.81]It's open.
[39:58.99]Okay, here we go.
[40:04.11]Easy!
[40:05.19]Easy!
[40:07.07]You don't have to slam the door that hard.
[40:11.88]It took him that long to figure out somebody walked in.
[40:15.56]God, everyone's like a creep, too.
[40:19.24]Yes, I am.
[40:20.02]Easily made up name.
[40:27.11]Yeah, he did.
[40:28.01]I've got the- that fish that sings.
[40:29.93]Oh my god.
[40:33.30]This is- this guy's just the- the- this is what, like, the fucking goblins in Warcraft were based off of.
[40:43.62]What?
[40:46.94]What?
[40:59.36]Gibson, Gleason, Gordon.
[41:02.98]Oh, Gordon, yeah.
[41:03.72]Here's his porn collection.
[41:05.26]He's got great stuff from Playboy.
[41:07.06]What else we got here?
[41:09.44]Playgirl.
[41:11.09]He was into everything, you know?
[41:12.05]People what took over the old Caravash estate.
[41:15.15]It's Carnivosh.
[41:18.75]I remember that.
[41:19.95]Your husband was that photographer what takes the pictures for those magazines.
[41:24.68]Yeah.
[41:27.58]Well, my husband works for several magazines.
[41:30.72]He's doing a project for Newsday magazine right now.
[41:36.08]And you, lady, you're a writer, huh?
[41:38.80]Yes.
[41:41.02]I'm a novelist.
[41:42.34]Oh, a novelist.
[41:44.94]Here comes the, I'm going to make fun of you for being a novelist.
[41:49.14]Have you heard of a book called Blue Moon Rising?
[41:51.12]He even has a goblin voice.
[41:52.62]No, can't say I have.
[41:54.96]I'm not surprised.
[41:58.48]This is an awkward conversation.
[42:00.00]This interview is going real bad.
[42:01.90]Something else I think will cut this chit chat for today.
[42:05.84]I got a lot of work to do.
[42:07.85]I got another client I'm going to meet.
[42:11.01]I bet you do.
[42:13.77]Was this whole thing ad libbed?
[42:16.45]Okay, well, hold on.
[42:17.53]Well, what about money?
[42:20.17]As we all know, the prince...
[42:24.36]What's that Prince Goblin's name?
[42:25.88]You know what I'm talking about.
[42:27.03]They love fucking money.
[42:30.81]Alright, well, can I just like rifle through his shit?
[42:35.53]I don't know.
[42:39.25]Got all kinds of awards up here.
[42:45.78]I think I'll have a seat.
[42:50.02]Jesus Christ.
[42:53.92]I love how painfully long the cutscenes are.
[43:00.60]I'm just reading the magazine.
[43:02.09]No, I gotta leave.
[43:02.95]Somebody in town holds the key.
[43:04.23]So I have to stick a crawl bar in this guy's mouth.
[43:08.53]Is pretty much what he's trying to tell me.
[43:11.31]Hold on.
[43:12.07]Let's ask him now.
[43:12.73]Let's ask our magic 8-ball in our head.
[43:18.19]He's going to go, yes, well, using Malygos in your deck is actually considered good.
[43:24.14]Someone in town holds the key.
[43:26.70]Yeah.
[43:27.64]Okay.
[43:29.54]Alright, get up.
[43:31.96]Go to the water bubbler.
[43:39.41]Yeah.
[43:40.35]Be careful.
[43:40.81]It might be poisoned.
[43:50.12]Okay, what is that?
[43:50.86]Why would you even put that in the game?
[43:53.16]You know, this is one of those early FMV games where they wanted to make sure they showed every single possible thing.
[43:59.66]Like, that was revolutionary.
[44:01.20]You know what I'm saying?
[44:02.66]That was what we considered to be revolutionary.
[44:04.45]There is something.
[44:07.75]Yes.
[44:09.51]Keys.
[44:11.18]Are you sure you gave my husband all the keys to the Carnivash estate?
[44:14.68]I think he has porn all over the place over here, but I'm not even kidding.
[44:16.92]I gave him all I had.
[44:19.00]But if you don't believe me, why don't you just check for yourself?
[44:22.81]Well, I think I will.
[44:23.83]Like, we're making all these jokes.
[44:25.75]This is actually fucking like pornographic magazines all over his wall.
[44:29.21]I have to like rifle through.
[44:38.86]Okay.
[44:42.02]Oh, come on.
[44:46.13]Aha.
[44:51.59]Boy, how could you?
[44:57.17]That opens the main doors.
[45:01.83]No, I think I might.
[45:02.79]Am I sitting back down?
[45:04.43]No.
[45:04.71]Okay.
[45:05.63]I got the key.
[45:07.51]New key.
[45:08.17]This opens the giant door.
[45:11.90]I can leave this guy's house now.
[45:13.30]Okay, let's get out of here.
[45:14.34]What about the other establishment?
[45:17.90]This guy's got a lot of golf clubs.
[45:19.72]Those boots are huge, by the way.
[45:26.27]You won't believe what it unlocks.
[45:27.91]Oh, there's a new person.
[45:32.41]Let's go talk to this guy.
[45:33.81]That guy looks like a zombie.
[45:38.25]Those what are huge?
[45:44.49]It's not open, right?
[45:46.11]What if the key opened at this door?
[45:52.69]Well, we're just leaving.
[45:55.63]I got a key.
[45:56.77]That opens the big giant door to the big giant mansion.
[46:01.39]Okay, so here we go.
[46:02.92]Let's go in that big door.
[46:08.38]It's down here.
[46:08.98]Uh, wait.
[46:11.80]Where the fuck am I?
[46:13.28]Yeah, over here.
[46:15.50]No, this is new.
[46:16.22]I didn't see this.
[46:16.78]There's a cat here.
[46:18.08]Okay, I probably should look at the cat.
[46:24.26]I believe I just... I'm taking the newspaper.
[46:26.44]Alright, animal time.
[46:32.40]Hey, Spaz.
[46:34.66]Spaz.
[46:36.40]What a perfect cat name.
[46:37.75]Spaz.
[46:37.91]What a 90s term.
[46:38.43]Jesus.
[46:38.95]Jesus.
[46:49.17]Easy.
[46:49.49]Jesus.
[46:49.95]What the fuck?
[46:55.22]What about this way?
[46:57.82]Jesus.
[46:58.28]This is... Alright.
[47:00.42]Is this open?
[47:02.44]Alright.
[47:03.16]Time to use the big key.
[47:07.94]I'm ready.
[47:10.67]No, I'm not.
[47:11.99]I'm not ready.
[47:15.07]Let's try this.
[47:19.08]Is it the correct key?
[47:20.88]It is.
[47:21.50]Here we go.
[47:27.08]I get to keep the key.
[47:35.59]And here are the files, whatever these are.
[47:37.21]Yeah, we made some progress.
[47:46.76]No, we're not next thing until somebody dies.
[47:50.21]We will, don't worry, we will.
[47:52.71]It's like a jokey show.
[47:53.77]It was like a show, a horror show.
[48:16.31]The teddy bear died?
[48:23.69]No.
[48:27.11]That's what Phantasmagoria is.
[48:28.99]It's like a crazy horror show.
[48:34.35]No, we're not going to next until I see... I want to see somebody's head explode.
[48:38.43]Once somebody's head explodes, then we're going to move on to the next game.
[48:43.77]Why would we have to?
[48:45.59]Whatever this is, we're going to take this.
[48:52.10]I think that's a cat.
[48:57.80]Do I have a toy cat?
[49:02.32]Can anything else be used here?
[49:08.55]Yeah, we need, we need, exactly.
[49:10.53]We need at least one rubber head full of spaghetti being crushed.
[49:16.85]I'm starting to run out of room.
[49:22.65]Dear Jeremiah, it has come to my attention that you have recently acquired a unique book while traveling through Egypt this most recent winter.
[49:31.72]Alright, I get it.
[49:43.93]Ancient rituals.
[49:45.25]Don't fuck around.
[49:49.43]He's in the game.
[49:50.69]Yeah, the guy's actually in the game.
[49:51.75]Alright, what can I do here?
[49:55.49]Can't place that.
[49:57.13]What about like matches?
[49:59.67]No.
[50:01.05]Nothing here.
[50:02.03]I guess I gotta lean in closer, maybe.
[50:06.73]This is gonna spin around, isn't it?
[50:08.95]Don't do it.
[50:11.43]Oh, great.
[50:15.67]That was a really good what the hell.
[50:16.89]That was great acting.
[50:23.31]To look in it.
[50:26.08]This is a huge fireplace.
[50:28.09]If this fire was going, everybody in this whole room would be uncomfortable.
[50:37.61]You would have to leave this fucking room.
[50:39.53]Oh God.
[50:47.01]Okay, well here's like... This whole thing comes down.
[50:58.79]Unless you're planning on forging weapons, that thing should never be turned on.
[51:11.34]Well, I can't get in there.
[51:13.04]All I know is that there's stuff in there.
[51:19.81]I love that.
[51:21.03]Let's use the fire poker.
[51:22.91]Let's reach in there.
[51:26.24]Dig in.
[51:26.92]Dig around in there and try to get the hidden item.
[51:32.80]Is that going to work?
[51:36.48]Come on.
[51:36.90]Really?
[51:37.61]That's bullshit.
[51:42.53]What about the cat?
[51:43.49]Put the cat in there.
[51:44.49]What about money?
[51:45.01]Maybe that's just like a jump.
[51:45.85]Maybe that's like a thing to slide the money into and it gives you something.
[51:50.36]I obviously can't do anything here.
[51:55.07]Porn poker.
[51:57.33]I think this room is done.
[51:59.37]This room is done, though.
[52:00.74]Unless I go over here.
[52:03.24]Maybe.
[52:03.52]Okay.
[52:05.06]Books.
[52:06.36]Just like in the olden days.
[52:14.02]Okay.
[52:14.79]Counting my books.
[52:15.85]Good.
[52:19.05]And there's nothing else I can even do in here.
[52:20.67]So let's go.
[52:24.36]I didn't click the bed.
[52:25.54]No, we're not clicking any beds.
[52:30.07]I gotta go to like the other door.
[52:31.25]What was the other door that was locked?
[52:37.89]Okay, okay.
[52:39.67]What the fuck is with all these like hidden awful scenes?
[52:45.02]I just got like an emergency text.
[52:49.44]Hey, you know something's bad when there's an emergency text.
[52:56.74]I will not do that.
[53:04.87]I think that's me.
[53:06.65]I got some cards here.
[53:10.21]Click the bed.
[53:17.14]Okay, here we go.
[53:18.98]I'm ready to hit the button.
[53:23.18]She's going to sit and then it's going to initiate the cutscene and I'm going to
[53:26.94]Don't do it.
[53:38.23]We're all like anticipating something.
[53:44.74]No, I think she just sits on the board.
[53:47.90]Safe.
[53:49.54]That link actually went to the place that I thought it was going to go to.
[54:02.24]What about inside?
[54:03.07]I need to get rid of some of these items.
[54:08.99]Why do I do this to myself?
[54:10.07]I don't know.
[54:11.03]It's kind of interesting.
[54:14.19]The game, I mean.
[54:15.01]Gazebo.
[54:15.19]We'll meet in the casino.
[54:29.80]Angel, how I yearn for your sweet kiss.
[54:32.54]Your strong arms holding me.
[54:33.83]Alright, well, everyone can fuck off.
[54:36.91]Not you guys, I mean, like, in the game.
[54:39.87]Let's ask the magician what he wants.
[54:41.73]Let's see what the magic head wants us to do.
[54:45.89]Mortar is best removed with a narrow scraping implement.
[54:53.39]Mortar is best removed with a narrow scraping implement.
[54:58.31]Isn't that what I was just doing?
[55:05.09]I thought I was just doing that.
[55:12.07]Okay, don't need to look at me anymore in my fucking goofy clown costume.
[55:22.18]Alright, this is the magician bed.
[55:25.50]We're taking a risk here.
[55:29.40]We're taking a risk.
[55:30.12]Okay.
[55:32.88]Okay.
[55:33.40]Oh fuck!
[55:34.82]Oh fuck.
[55:35.46]Here comes the cutscene.
[55:56.89]Why is there no audio?
[56:00.33]I lost audio.
[56:07.92]Uh-huh.
[56:08.60]Yeah.
[56:09.30]Okay.
[56:13.36]That's it!
[56:15.08]That's it!
[56:15.74]Okay!
[56:17.32]Hey, we're back!
[56:18.74]Hey!
[56:19.93]Everybody!
[56:20.63]How are ya?
[56:24.89]And scene!
[56:29.97]And nothing happened!
[56:32.77]It was just like a loud- It was just like a loud, like, whoosh.
[56:41.04]Jesus Christ.
[56:42.56]Alright, we're good.
[56:43.56]Let's keep going.
[56:46.68]I looked at everything here.
[56:50.58]Let's go open the other door.
[56:56.00]Let's just get out of here.
[56:56.84]The fucking stupid magician room.
[57:02.61]I don't have any drain cleaner for this guy.
[57:05.55]This is the other torture device.
[57:09.62]Nothing even in here.
[57:10.24]Alright, where was that other locked door?
[57:11.50]This is where he's... No, he's not even in here anymore.
[57:18.96]Oh, no, there he is.
[57:19.50]Let's see what he's doing now.
[57:22.31]He's putting up a shelf.
[57:25.57]Adrian, I can do this better myself.
[57:27.53]Please?
[57:29.31]Okay.
[57:29.93]Jeez.
[57:31.51]I'm sorry, hon.
[57:32.95]I'm just trying to get this done.
[57:38.19]Been here for a long time.
[57:45.95]Can I give him money?
[57:47.07]Is there anything I need to do with him?
[57:50.63]No.
[57:50.87]Let me look over here.
[57:56.91]Ew.
[57:57.89]Is his sink still clogged?
[58:00.64]Yeah.
[58:02.02]I'm gonna work on it again later.
[58:03.34]What is that?
[58:03.84]Okay, well let me know if I can help.
[58:06.28]Thanks.
[58:09.92]It was safe for work.
[58:11.02]Well, you guys have got me all kind of way right now.
[58:15.52]It'll be fine.
[58:16.76]Everything's gonna be fine.
[58:20.76]Let's go... Where do we get to go?
[58:22.38]This way.
[58:22.74]Alright, so where... Where was that other room?
[58:30.31]I'm gonna burn something.
[58:31.19]Hold on.
[58:34.43]Burn the newspaper?
[58:35.69]No.
[58:37.17]Burn the cards.
[58:38.63]Burn the money.
[58:41.23]No.
[58:43.79]I don't know where the hell this other key is.
[58:53.10]Right here?
[58:55.24]No, this is just outside.
[58:56.20]I didn't look at this yet.
[59:07.76]Alright, nothing.
[59:09.14]What about around this side of the house?
[59:11.44]Giant face.
[59:14.02]Nothing else worth looking at, I don't think.
[59:19.95]The door upstairs in the hallway.
[59:22.29]I thought I was already up there, though.
[59:28.31]Let's go this way.
[59:30.67]Here's like the kitchen.
[59:34.08]Wasn't this locked?
[59:36.62]No, no, no.
[59:36.96]Okay, let's try to get this open.
[59:38.98]Are you serious?
[59:42.75]I gotta turn the light on.
[59:43.65]Alright, now... Come on.
[59:46.47]I can pry this open, can't I?
[59:47.77]This better be building up to one hell of a joke.
[59:55.67]I don't know if it is.
[60:00.57]There's no joke.
[60:01.27]This is just a horror game.
[60:02.39]We're playing a horror game right now.
[60:08.95]Oh boy.
[60:14.88]Finding a key is the only thing I've done.
[60:16.42]Well, not quite, because now we're in the creepy dungeon.
[60:25.10]I'm going to find out what's really going on down here.
[60:32.85]Here we go.
[60:36.39]This is where there's gonna be like four people down here.
[60:38.27]I can't see a thing down there.
[60:40.21]Oh, come on.
[60:42.67]I need... Shit!
[60:51.16]Alright, let's go to the... Fuck.
[60:57.38]Well... I just want to watch a guy's head explode and then we can play the next game.
[61:06.03]No, wrong way.
[61:09.77]Wrong way, you stupid... Here we go.
[61:13.87]No, fucking ass.
[61:15.59]Oh, you dickhead.
[61:16.37]Go in here.
[61:16.79]Over this way.
[61:20.74]Alright, now, up... Okay.
[61:32.64]What about this door?
[61:34.91]Next to the piano.
[61:35.57]No.
[61:41.43]Okay, here we go.
[61:44.14]This is where we're going to get to.
[61:44.94]This is where the game starts.
[61:45.92]Here it comes.
[61:46.44]Phantasmagoria.
[61:49.10]I'm going to open this door.
[61:50.70]And this is going to be like somebody's face ripped off.
[62:01.32]This is the final boss door.
[62:06.11]Here we go.
[62:15.45]It didn't open.
[62:16.49]Fuck.
[62:18.81]Just wait a minute.
[62:19.95]Wait a minute.
[62:20.33]Everyone hold on.
[62:22.79]This fucking piano needs to shut up.
[62:27.54]What about the cat?
[62:28.22]Can I give the cat to the cat?
[62:32.52]Everybody hold on a second.
[62:33.58]Alright, up the stairs.
[62:42.43]In the hallway.
[62:47.58]Now where?
[62:48.80]Over here.
[62:51.16]Up the stairs.
[62:52.96]Bingo.
[62:54.06]Key.
[62:54.96]End door.
[63:00.73]Yes, I know it's- Oh, it opens.
[63:03.35]Good.
[63:03.99]Open.
[63:07.83]Fuck, it didn't open.
[63:08.57]Shit.
[63:10.42]What about this door?
[63:25.62]Hold on.
[63:27.96]This is new.
[63:31.08]We haven't been in here yet.
[63:34.62]What's in there?
[63:42.65]An apron.
[63:45.99]There are some... What's with all the fireplaces?
[63:49.69]Oh, it's H. It's fucking like Hermione's fucking Hogwarts backpack.
[63:54.50]How suspenseful.
[64:04.18]Mortar is best removed with it, but what is he even talking about?
[64:08.26]It's like this paint.
[64:11.56]It's that's a guy gonna to get like a paintbrush and go down there, huh?
[64:18.41]There isn't a head explosion oh Wow a genuine Leonardo da Vinci oh wow let's put it back And we have to use our own blood to paint the painting oh
[64:45.21]Uh-huh.
[64:47.23]You know, I'm one of those proponents that anything could probably be art.
[64:50.53]But if you've got a blank canvas and you're trying to tell me it's art, that's not.
[64:54.87]I don't believe you.
[64:56.55]I don't believe you.
[64:58.13]I'm sorry.
[65:04.53]I just don't believe you.
[65:08.86]Can I burn the canvas?
[65:14.30]Couch.
[65:17.17]Alright, this is new.
[65:18.59]This is like a dragon box.
[65:20.15]What is this thing?
[65:36.32]Okay.
[65:40.02]What's this?
[66:08.60]Okay, let's go ahead and walk in the next door here in a second.
[66:11.18]Let me just make sure I get this right.
[66:12.52]Okay, one sec.
[66:29.09]Alright, let's just, okay, let's walk in the door here.
[66:37.28]Remember the gardener from earlier?
[66:44.95]So Tom, what are you doing here?
[67:01.96]What are you doing here?
[67:06.88]Did somebody record this in their, like, fucking- in, like, a plane?
[67:09.94]Alright, so this is gonna be, like, a very generic, like, stab scene.
[67:23.15]God fucking dammit.
[67:28.67]Am I fucking skipping this?! !
[67:35.27]Alright, I don't even want to see it!
[67:38.33]I don't even want to see it!
[67:39.19]I'm not- I don't want to see it!
[67:44.44]I don't even want to see it!
[67:45.32]I don't even want to see it!
[68:00.29]Okay, whatever, this is a fun game!
[68:03.05]Cool!
[68:05.21]That's what we came for.
[68:06.73]We came to see that.
[68:08.27]That's why we made him eat dirt.
[68:09.59]That was what we were trying to accomplish the whole game.
[68:12.86]Was to watch him eat dirt.
[68:16.10]And that was what we call crazy.
[68:18.36]You know what I mean?
[68:21.72]What is going on?
[68:22.90]I can still hear sounds.
[68:35.99]Hold on a sec.
[68:37.81]Alright, let's just go ahead and continue our playthrough here.
[68:42.89]While we have a second, you know what I mean?
[68:46.27]Let's go through this door here.
[68:49.35]Let's go click on the bathroom.
[68:53.36]Let's just click on this. ...
[69:10.20]Okay.
[69:11.28]You know, I'm sick of this game already.
[69:14.03]I can't... I can't even get it.
[69:18.51]Stop it!
[69:19.69]Get out of here!
[69:31.36]Okay Next game next game and I was afraid I can hear like bones breaking I could oh You guys missed it.

[69:58.58]Alright, get this out of here.
[70:00.26]Let's move on to the next game.
[70:07.76]That game is like, probably, that game is like intense and it's scary and this is just Halloween.
[70:14.56]We shouldn't be, you should be like, go read a book.
