[00:09.16]Mummy versus Kruger.
[00:10.33]Are you ready to get thrown into the flames of Kruger?
[00:13.85]Do you even know a single button to this game?
[00:16.15]I don't know.
[00:16.51]I don't want to do strategy games because people will expect some level of skill.
[00:20.03]Wait, wait, wait.
[00:20.99]Just hold on a second.
[00:21.69]We need to, like, make sure we... Hold on.
[00:23.97]I gotta get my, like, buttons in check.
[00:25.97]So, before we get started... Button check.
[00:27.05]Button check.
[00:27.49]We need to do a button check.
[00:28.49]So, okay.
[00:28.95]Button check.
[00:30.85]That's that.
[00:31.52]That's that.
[00:32.20]Okay.
[00:32.58]Button... Button check.
[00:35.28]I'm just button checking.
[00:37.42]I'm okay with this.
[00:40.50]Alright, button check is still going on.
[00:42.18]Alright, my button check's good.
[00:43.24]Good, play.
[00:46.64]You wanna mess with the Kroger?
[00:48.92]You wanna mess with the Kroger?
[00:53.29]You wanna mess with Freddy Kroger?
[00:54.93]You wanna mess with me?
[00:56.43]Here you go.
[01:02.09]I wasn't expecting this, to be honest with you.
[01:05.85]It's because Freddy Krueger is, like, broken.
[01:11.19]What the hell are you doing?
[01:11.99]You're, like, sucking out my soul.
[01:14.19]You wanna play this game?
[01:15.45]Oh, how do you do, like, the X-Factor?
[01:21.46]How do I, like, sing on UK television?
[01:23.54]The X-Factor.
[01:24.76]I don't care.
[01:29.03]No, no, no, no, no!
[01:32.96]Get crushed!
[01:43.45]This game is brutal!

[01:54.54]You just jumped up and like, you broke my neck and then you shattered my spine!
[02:00.36]You know who I honestly thought would have, Jerma would have picked immediately?
[02:03.52]Who?
[02:05.62]Look at his face.
[02:06.32]But that's Baraka though, Baraka is like Baraka.
[02:08.84]Barack Obama is like, we talk about him all the time.
[02:10.88]I don't want to play, I don't want to play as Barack Obama.
[02:13.16]I want to play as the God of War Kratos.
[02:15.94]Okay.
[02:17.34]Either God of War Kratos or like this beady-eyed motherfucker.
[02:20.10]Because this is Mortal Kombat.
[02:22.22]This is the storyline.

[02:25.02]This is where Striker is, right?
[02:26.58]Oh, cool, cool, we were playing.
[02:27.62]We were like actually playing and not like, like looking at something.
[02:32.23]Oh my fucking god.

[07:09.48]Confirmed favorite character in the game.
[07:12.14]Because people throw up when they get kicked in the balls.
[07:14.22]No, okay, this is tied up.
[07:22.19]I'm gonna stop messing around here and do some moves.
[07:34.56]Whoa!
[07:36.22]What?
[07:37.12]What's going on?
[07:38.54]Okay, well the game decided you don't want to have a video.
[07:42.43]What?
[07:43.11]No videos.
[07:45.31]Desynchronized?
