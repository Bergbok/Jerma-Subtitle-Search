[00:08.60]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.32]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.75]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the default rocket launcher, the Conqueror, the recently buffed Conqueror, and the Escape Plan.
[00:23.70]And this is also going to be a coffee commentary of justice and doom.
[00:27.12]Just want to let you know beforehand.
[00:28.42]One, a two, a three.
[00:30.24]That's how many licks it takes to get to the bottom of a pyro pop.
[00:32.52]So let's keep going here with this coffee commentary.
[00:36.82]Okay, so a coffee commentary is when I just hit record.
[00:41.54]and I just go, after drinking a couple coffees, and I'm just crazy and out of my mind.
[00:45.98]Do what?
[00:46.37]Let's go!
[00:47.11]So, playing on Cold Front, again with the soldier, and this is a very underplayed map.
[00:51.99]I wish I could play on this a lot more often, but every time I do the server browser, it seems like there's only four, or maybe even two, that are in the entire server browser, which is unfortunate, but I know it's a five control point map,
[01:04.17]And they take ages on public games because they just go back and forth.
[01:07.61]It's always just a stale mate.
[01:08.94]It's always just a stale, smelly fish mate.
[01:11.62]So... That's what I gotta say about Cold Front.
[01:14.80]No, I'm lying.
[01:15.46]I actually have more to say about Cold Front.
[01:17.24]Anytime I hear the word Cold Front or the map or whatever, I always just think of some weatherman just standing in front of the green screen just going...
[01:24.21]Yep, today is going to be, there's a cold front coming down from the northwest section, coming down to the northeast, and it's just absolutely going to wreck your house and you're all going to die.
[01:33.28]I've never heard a weatherman say that, but he could.
[01:35.21]You know, it might be one day a weatherman's going to come on the screen and just go, Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:40.21]There's a giant tornado coming straight for your house, please run!
[01:45.28]And we're all gonna run, and hopefully we all survive.
[01:48.26]Also, why does this guy have a blue face?
[01:50.38]I'm realizing this right now.
[01:51.80]Why did I draw him with a blue face?
[01:53.50]What is he, Grover from Sesame Street?
[01:55.36]Like, what is this guy?
[01:56.82]It's like Grover and Bozo the Clown had a child, and there he is on the screen for you.
[02:02.62]I promise, I'm so bad at drawing, I will never draw anything ever again.
[02:08.33]So, soldier, cold front, killing a couple people, a soldier and a scout.
[02:11.89]This is a great place to hang out as a soldier, because so many people just stuff down this left side, or right side if you're on the blue team.
[02:18.96]It's just crazy.
[02:19.74]So many people just filter into that little area.
[02:22.46]And plus, you have this little gate right here to protect yourself if somebody comes after you.
[02:25.66]Like there, I just got a two-piece because of this gate.
[02:28.92]And oh, my HUD.
[02:29.90]I keep seeing the numbers pop up.
[02:31.70]I keep forgetting to do this, and I really am sorry.
[02:34.55]I'm gonna put my HUD in the description of every Team Fortress video now.
[02:38.53]It's actually Starz.
[02:39.87]He took KN, the KN Garmin HUD combination, and he made it his own.
[02:44.09]He did little things to it.
[02:44.95]He tweaked it.
[02:45.73]But it's gonna be in the description of my videos.
[02:47.39]You can get it from his channel page too.
[02:49.23]But that's the HUD.
[02:50.99]That's the big hubbub of the HUD.
[02:53.33]So here's my favorite part of the whole video.
[02:54.83]I got nowhere to go, so I just...
[02:57.79]I get shot right in the back by a sniper.
[02:59.48]If I had stood up and tried to go around that gate, that sentry would have lit up my entire Christmas tree, and I would have died instantly.
[03:06.28]But we're gonna transition here.
[03:07.64]This is a second gameplay.
[03:09.26]A one-life gameplay.
[03:10.38]Both of these are one-life back-to-back.
[03:12.30]This is defending the final point on Cold Front.
[03:15.22]And I think... I don't remember if we push forward or not.
[03:17.86]I think we do, but my brain is Swiss cheese, so sometimes I forget things, and this is something I absolutely forgot.
[03:23.59]So we're either going to push up or we're not going to push up, which is pretty much the outcome of any video you watch on Team Fortress.
[03:29.27]Hey, you're either going to lose or you're going to win.
[03:31.65]Which one is it going to be?
[03:33.22]So let's take on this soldier right now.
[03:34.76]Me and you.
[03:35.16]Here we go, buddy.
[03:35.96]One, two rockets.
[03:36.80]Got you landed.
[03:37.66]Let's do it.
[03:38.60]And miss.
[03:39.66]And just shoot 150 rockets at him and miss every time.
[03:42.90]And the pyro got him, though, so that's a good thing.
[03:44.47]Good job, pyro.
[03:45.63]You are my friend.
[03:47.21]Blowing the horn.
[03:48.27]Let's see what I can do with this now.
[03:49.31]I'm just going to shoutcast.
[03:50.25]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[03:52.30]So, turning this corner, seeing a couple friendlies running away from the front line.
[03:55.03]Something amiss must be happening.
[03:56.13]Kret Rock is shooting this guy.
[03:57.27]That's actually a spy, and here's a spy tip for you.
[03:59.21]If you're going to play as a medic, I'm sorry, if you're going to disguise as a medic, you want to make sure you want to do one very important thing.
[04:02.85]Don't run around with a syringe gun.
[04:03.93]Change to the bone saw or the medigun, because if you run around with a syringe gun, everyone's going to think you're a spy, and everyone's going to know you're a spy, because you're actually running around not healing anybody.
[04:11.16]So please use that as a tip, and killing that medic in the meantime, in the process.
[04:16.33]But I'll slow it down for you.
[04:17.65]If you're going to play spy, make sure when you're disguising as a medic, pull out the medigun, switch to your secondary and hit B. Because then at least you're running around with the medigun and you look like you're doing something medic-y.
[04:29.36]Not shooting people with a syringe gun or something.
[04:31.70]It looks a little less suspicious.
[04:34.20]Coming down to one minute left in this coffee commentary, watching this heavy explode makes me sad, but that's kind of funny at the same time.
[04:41.66]Anytime anyone explodes in this game, it's actually pretty funny.
[04:44.64]But in the last, like, 40 seconds I have, I want to say one thing.
[04:47.65]The Conqueror is really, really good now.
[04:50.23]They made it so much better.
[04:51.77]It takes, like, no time at all to charge this thing.
[04:54.41]The health it gives back is... is not really that spectacular, but the amount of times you can do it in such a short duration, it's just... it makes it worth it.
[05:03.42]That's going to wrap things up here, guys.
[05:05.00]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:06.56]I really do appreciate it.
[05:07.74]And if you like this video, go ahead and throw me a like, because it really does help spread the infection of the germs.
[05:12.83]Help spread the infection.
[05:16.77]But yeah, guys, of course, I will see you guys all next time.
[05:19.14]And take care, everybody.
