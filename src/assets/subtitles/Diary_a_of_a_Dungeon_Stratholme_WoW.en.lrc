[01:01.55]I'm going to do the drums.
[01:02.67]I don't even know that there's more than one part.
[01:05.21]It's just the song.
[01:06.49]That's all that that is.
[01:07.96]Yeah, but we're going to make it our own thing.
[01:09.62]Do you know the concept of instruments?
[01:13.65]Yeah, and it's just a saxophone.
[01:15.17]That's all that, like, plays that.
[01:16.81]Saxophone?
[01:18.25]What?
[01:21.29]That is not a saxophone.
[01:24.77]It's like Bill Clinton and something.
[01:26.16]Like, it's a saxophone.
[01:27.96]He said, I hope you guys don't mind if I pull this tank.
[01:30.30]It's effing slow.
