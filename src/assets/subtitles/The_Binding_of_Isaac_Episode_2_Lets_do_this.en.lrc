[00:09.48]I got plenty of health.
[00:11.14]Dog food?
[00:13.02]HP up.
[00:14.88]Oh, wow.
[00:15.95]Okay.
[00:17.23]I already had pretty much full health anyways, though, didn't I?
[00:20.87]What's down... What's this?
[00:23.91]Okay.
[00:24.75]Um... I... I'm a little concerned right now.
[00:29.49]I don't know what's going on.
[00:30.53]Alright, left or right?
[00:33.95]Left or right?
[00:35.86]Left.
[00:37.70]Rimstone.
[00:39.04]Whoa.
[00:39.58]Whoa, what?
[00:41.56]What the hell is this?
[00:44.64]What is going on?
[00:47.48]Whoa!
[00:49.07]Does that hurt me?
[00:51.85]Oh, I lost a... Okay, should I... Okay, I'm just gonna go.
[00:55.59]I'm not even gonna pretend like I know what's going on.
[00:59.59]Level three, the caves.
[01:01.13]One.
[01:01.29]Alright.
[01:02.50]Okay.
[01:03.59]So I'm still this guy.
[01:05.67]You have to hold it down.
[01:06.59]This could be pretty deadly.
[01:11.03]Oh.
[01:12.31]I don't know if I like this.
[01:14.95]Yeah, I don't know if I like this.
[01:15.91]You have to, like, wait before you can shoot.
[01:17.53]Eh, it's not that bad.
[01:23.42]Let's keep going.
[01:25.80]I probably missed something in that room.
[01:27.28]If you, like, destroy the gargoyle, you get $5,000.
[01:32.23]Actually, this is pretty cool.
[01:33.81]Not gonna lie.
[01:37.67]Boom!
[01:39.87]Bomb.
[01:41.29]Down or right?
[01:41.99]Let's go down.
[01:42.41]Oh, what do you know about my super stream, Beam?
[01:48.06]What do you know about my super stream?
[01:50.62]I forgot those bug things are here.
[01:53.34]What do you know, cauliflower boy?
[01:56.04]You're done.
[01:58.14]Let's get rid of those.
[02:00.84]Now, I'm wondering...
[02:03.29]If I... I don't think I can waste this.
[02:05.11]I'm pretty sure I just have this forever until I die.
[02:07.83]Which is... Someone just died right there, speaking of death.
[02:12.89]This is where it gets a little tricky.
[02:16.93]I'm just gonna stand here.
[02:17.99]Oh, God.
[02:20.49]I don't wanna die, because I don't wanna lose this.
[02:23.77]Get out of here, get out of here!
[02:24.83]That was the scariest thing in the world.
[02:29.73]You can't mess with my fire and brimstone, baby.
[02:33.59]So, what I was going to say is I'm wondering if I die... There's no checkpoints in this game, I don't think.
[02:40.05]There is not.
[02:41.73]Can I open that?
[02:42.93]I can.
[02:44.63]Give me that health.
[02:46.17]No, I can't.
[02:46.89]I have temper... No, you know what?
[02:49.65]Now, screw the boss.
[02:50.29]I'm not going for the boss right now.
[02:51.99]That's a bad idea.
[02:53.91]There could be some hidden secrets that I'm missing that I don't want to miss.
[03:00.39]Let's go right.
[03:01.72]I'm gonna charge up my stuff beforehand.
[03:05.66]Ooh, I don't know how I just didn't get hit by that.
[03:09.60]Okay, I don't have any keys.
[03:12.16]Let's just get out of here.
[03:15.27]I don't have any... I can't get any health.
[03:18.65]Hopefully there's something cool over here.
[03:20.61]Oh, dear God.
[03:22.37]Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.
[03:23.57]Oh, my God.
[03:26.96]Oh, I have to hold this stupid thing down.
[03:30.79]If I didn't have to hold that down... Now I'm gonna get my ass kicked at the boss.
[03:35.74]Shit.
[03:38.60]Die.
[03:40.62]Actually, there's health on the way.
[03:43.92]Got a key, I can open that item door now.
[03:45.64]That's a good thing.
[03:48.24]How am I supposed to get that chest?
[03:51.88]How... I'm confused.
[03:54.28]How does one cross that and get the chest?
[03:57.94]It's probably an item you can get that does it, to be honest.
[04:03.25]Shit.
[04:07.55]And... Here comes the pitch!
[04:09.33]And it's a home run!
[04:11.95]I need to be careful here.
[04:13.03]Because I will die and lose everything.
[04:16.47]And then I will want to shoot myself in the face.
[04:19.25]Pills here!
[04:21.23]So what, you just hit Q to use the pills?
[04:25.51]Yeah, come on, get in a line like that.
[04:26.97]Just like that.
[04:28.05]Bang.
[04:30.44]I can go in here.
[04:31.51]Okay, so here's the conundrum.
[04:33.27]Do I go in the room?
[04:36.03]Yes.
[04:38.97]Okay.
[04:42.05]Okay, okay, we're good.
[04:42.89]We're good.
[04:43.67]I get it.
[04:44.29]I get it.
[04:47.18]Oh, nothing.
[04:48.56]You maggot bastards.
[04:51.46]So, the door is... So, you get a chest, but... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:55.70]You have to do it again?
[04:56.36]Oh, God.
[04:57.14]Oh, God.
[04:58.92]If I knew that, I wouldn't have signed up for this deal.
[05:02.32]Jeez.
[05:04.42]My God.
[05:05.08]I bet you there's another one, too.
[05:06.38]I just really royally screwed myself right here.
[05:10.09]Oh, my God.
[05:13.43]Jesus.
[05:15.23]Oh, my God.
[05:17.67]I don't think that was worth it, even though I didn't lose any health.
[05:20.39]That was not worth it.
[05:21.25]I'm gonna safely say.
[05:24.56]But I do have a key now.
[05:27.38]And I can go...
[05:29.05]Into that item room.
[05:31.17]So I'm pretty stoked.
[05:37.79]The Binding of Isaac.
[05:41.09]Okay, item room.
[05:42.19]Yeah, item room.
[05:42.85]It's a guaranteed item.
[05:44.37]Why the hell wouldn't I do that?
[05:47.17]Damage up.
[05:47.93]Blood of the Martyr.
[05:50.36]I got a lot of items on right now.
[05:53.58]I am ready to rock.
[05:55.10]So wherever you are... Oh, he's down there, I remember.
[05:58.39]I've also got pills, so I'm ready to go to caves too.
[06:03.94]And you can take that to the bank, whoever this boss is right here.
[06:08.04]I got full health, two hearts, that sucks, but you know, whatever.
[06:10.90]Alright, Isaac versus Fistula.
[06:16.00]That's not disgusting at all.
[06:18.12]Oh, don't worry, you're not disgusting.
[06:21.42]I'm not looking forward to this.
[06:23.60]Whoa.
[06:26.90]Oh my god.
[06:27.76]Pills!
[06:28.08]Take the pills!
[06:29.62]What?
[06:29.98]What?
[06:30.36]What is going on?
[06:32.72]No!
[06:33.06]I'm gonna die!
[06:33.56]I'm gonna die!
[06:35.68]Oh, that was so stupid!
[06:37.66]Hold on.
[06:38.30]Don't freak out.
[06:40.37]You got this.
[06:41.59]Get the heart.
[06:42.03]Just get the heart.
[06:42.61]It's okay.
[06:42.95]It's right there.
[06:44.79]Nice.
[06:46.21]Nice!
[06:47.81]Okay, that was a minor freakout right there, but I did it.
[06:50.73]And I got some lipstick.
[06:53.65]Nah, I don't really need range with this thing.
[06:55.33]It goes across the whole map.
[06:57.95]Alright, let's move on.
[07:00.37]Move on to the caves, too.
[07:04.10]Oh, this is gonna be nice.
[07:06.38]See ya.
[07:06.70]Can I beat this game?
[07:08.70]Please tell me I can just beat this game.
[07:12.96]TNT.
[07:15.59]Okay, let's... Oh my god.
[07:20.29]No, no, no, no.
[07:22.09]No!
[07:22.99]No!
[07:23.67]No!
[07:34.65]god damn so it turns out that that was not the best thing to do and I will get back up to that part
