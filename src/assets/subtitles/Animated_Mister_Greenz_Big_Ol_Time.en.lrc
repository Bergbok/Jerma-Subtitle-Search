[00:03.58]I am invincible.
[00:05.32]I am untouchable.
[00:08.78]No one can fuck with Mr. Green.
[00:14.03]That's a 19, baby.
[00:16.69]Stand on 19.
[00:17.31]What do you got?
[00:21.93]He ain't got nothing.
[00:23.53]And I know for a fact that the next card in there is gonna be Blackjack at 50 grand.
[00:30.18]I'm not good for it.
[00:32.75]Oh Jesus Christ.
[00:33.85]Disagree.
[00:35.23]I'm alright.
[00:36.11]I just had to find a bed.
[00:37.73]I felt kind of sick earlier.
[00:56.36]I'm all right.
[00:56.80]I'm okay.
[00:58.04]Mr. Green, you can't just throw up on the table.
[00:59.76]I know I can't.
[01:01.70]Somebody will come help me.
[01:04.06]Mr. Green, you can't take your shirt off.
[01:05.66]Just give me a second.
[01:06.56]I'll just throw up all over my shirt.
[01:08.74]I got five of these in a backpack that one of my associates has.
[01:12.24]Steve.
[01:13.92]Yes, Mr. Green.
[01:14.68]Give me another T-shirt.
[01:16.61]Oh, my God.
[01:21.79]Thank you, Steve.
[01:22.77]Ah!
[01:25.03]Ah!
[01:25.63]Ah!
[01:27.17]Mr. Green, are you okay?
[01:29.76]I think my arms just, I think I might have, something exploded in there.
[01:33.46]I felt it, I could feel it.
[01:35.26]I heard it.
[01:37.34]Mr. Green, do you want to hit?
[01:39.41]Hold on a second.
[01:40.67]This will be the third heart attack in the last probably three days.
[01:43.31]Hold on, I just need to grab my hand on the table.
[01:48.47]He hit.
[01:49.04]No, I'm just grabbing the table, for God's sakes.
[01:52.55]Hold on a second.
[01:53.45]I gotta stand up.
[01:54.55]I gotta stand up.
[01:55.38]You'd like to stand?
[01:56.28]No, I don't want to.
[01:59.10]Mr. Green, you've won.
[02:02.90]Ow!
[02:03.72]A $200,000.
[02:06.40]Steve!
[02:08.36]Steve, I need you.
[02:10.47]Yes, Mr. Green.
[02:11.85]Can you help?
[02:12.29]Can you clean that part up over there?
[02:16.25]All the lunch came on already.
