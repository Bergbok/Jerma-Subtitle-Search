[00:47.41]Why unpacking?
[00:48.09]I don't know.
[00:51.37]Because I feel like it.
[01:06.52]I have played this game, haven't I?
[01:07.92]I think me and Holly played it for a little bit.
[01:11.00]I feel like I've watched Holly.
[01:14.88]Like, I fell asleep to Holly playing this one.
[01:24.04]Calm down?
[01:24.64]What?
[01:25.58]I just realized you can't see it.
[01:27.14]Come on.
[01:32.53]I know.
[01:32.77]I'm working on it.
[01:43.67]Yeah, there already was a save file.
[01:44.85]I think I fell asleep to Holly playing this.
[01:51.69]It was so relaxing.
[01:52.67]Alright, you ready?
[01:56.16]So, I think, yeah, I can open up boxes.
[01:58.06]Is this pre-recorded?
[02:03.04]No, it's not.
[02:03.46]Alright, so I gotta decorate the room.
[02:05.60]Work faster.
[02:07.54]That's not the point of this, is to do it as slow as you can.
[02:10.95]You do this as slow as possible.
[02:25.25]I don't like it.
[02:25.61]I don't like this.
[02:26.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:26.97]Hold on.
[02:27.27]I gotta... Stop!
[02:28.03]Stop.
[02:28.29]I'm freaking out.
[02:28.95]Alright, stop.
[02:29.41]Put it away.
[02:31.58]Okay, I would put a soccer ball... I'm gonna do this the way I would do it.
[02:35.40]Of course I'm gonna put the trophy right here.
[02:39.26]There's no time limit.
[02:40.18]What if I'm going too slow?
[02:41.20]I want the money in the bed.
[02:53.46]This is like art stuff.
[02:54.64]I'm going to put it up here with the other art stuff.
[02:58.71]This is a diary or something.
[03:00.23]Put it away.
[03:03.11]Uh.
[03:05.27]Trash.
[03:07.97]Put the game away too.
[03:09.11]Only take that out when friends come over.
[03:11.25]Yeah.
[03:11.71]Put this stuff away.
[03:12.50]It goes here.
[03:12.98]Cool.
[03:14.44]Speed.
[03:18.20]I like this.
[03:18.64]This is fun.
[03:24.39]Is the game changing?
[03:25.69]You're going too slow.
[03:27.51]I'm gonna start... I'm gonna start... I'm gonna start timing you up.
[03:31.45]I'm gonna time you up for real.
[03:33.74]You're getting timed out.
[03:35.62]Okay.
[03:40.16]This is a nice place for that.
[03:45.73]I don't want this in my room.
[03:55.85]How do I put this away?
[03:59.06]I don't want this in here.
[04:03.56]Put him in the bed.
[04:04.30]I don't want this in the room.
[04:08.38]Now, there's a book.
[04:11.37]Put the toy... Okay, toys are going on this side.
[04:18.95]Alright, that's... No, no, no.
[04:19.85]This is going in here.
[04:21.49]Check this out.
[04:22.19]This is going to be where my journal is going to go in here.
[04:25.59]Now that's safe.
[04:26.55]And the scissors can fit in there too.
[04:28.11]Everything can, right?
[04:29.69]That's perfect.
[04:30.17]That's good.
[04:31.39]I don't want this in the room.
[04:41.51]That's like school supplies that's going in there.
[04:49.79]What's that?
[04:52.95]What the hell is this?
[04:53.65]I mean, that's kind of cool.
[04:56.78]You can sit out there.
[04:57.78]Flashlight?
[04:58.34]Just put it away.
[04:59.30]I don't need it.
[05:00.94]Put the books over here.
[05:05.00]Dear me, this is a choking hazard.
[05:08.05]Wait, how old am I?
[05:23.24]You're supposed to be three?
[05:27.08]What?
[05:27.38]I'm supposed to be three.
[05:38.85]23.
[05:38.87]Don't even... Alright, that's fine.
[05:43.93]Just put all the stuffed animals in the bed.
[05:49.08]How would I even lie in this bed?
[05:56.90]I have too much stuff.
[06:01.98]What is this?
[06:12.88]Uh, I'll put this... Oh, on the sill.
[06:24.25]That's fine.
[06:29.05]Alright, that's good.
[06:34.96]My bed has more than that.
[06:36.16]I got it!
[06:45.74]What's wrong with this?
[06:48.82]These are wrong?
[06:49.56]Let's put them away.
[07:03.97]This is the most stressful game I've ever played.
[07:06.67]Why?
[07:14.58]Finally, my own room.
[07:21.87]Quick playback.
[07:36.68]I try to throw the dinosaur away like five times.
[07:42.44]Tool assistant speed run.
[07:50.61]That looks fine.
[07:51.31]Okay, 2004.
[08:05.56]This is like a college room?
[08:15.26]Alright, this computer's gonna go right here.
[08:17.10]I don't have like 40 stuffed animals, right?
[08:22.28]What is this, a flute?
[08:25.10]I didn't mean to do that, I'm an idiot.
[08:26.38]Alright.
[08:27.50]What is this, a book?
[08:33.85]Alright, books are gonna go over here.
[08:35.53]Stand them up.
[08:35.97]Alright, these are art supplies.
[08:43.42]Um... Oh, there's a kitchen.
[08:47.64]And there's a bathtub.
[08:48.76]Alright.
[08:50.76]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[08:51.80]I gotta put this... I think I remember watching... Like, I was... My eye was like this, and I remember going like this.
[09:01.01]And seeing, like, flashes of this.
[09:03.79]While Holly was, like, organizing stuff.
[09:05.59]I was just like... I was definitely not dreaming.
[09:12.03]Alright, I'm gonna put these up here for now.
[09:20.81]Are these markers?
[09:21.47]I don't know.
[09:22.73]Put them up here.
[09:25.07]Book.
[09:27.41]More books.
[09:29.37]I don't give a shit about books.
[09:32.77]Alright, this can go here.
[09:33.63]I don't know what that is.
[09:39.72]It's going up with the books.
[09:40.52]What's that?
[09:50.56]I don't know what that is.
[10:01.35]Oh, it's a poster.
[10:02.07]Okay.
[10:02.19]Well, I'll put it right here.
[10:05.71]Book.
[10:07.83]Book.
[10:09.09]We got a lot of books.
[10:12.10]Oh.
[10:19.02]Toothbrush.
[10:20.76]Oh, no, no, no.
[10:21.28]Take this to the bathroom.
[10:30.99]Okay.
[10:32.25]Put that up here.
[10:33.91]Pants.
[10:34.19]Sneaker.
[10:35.67]Where's the other one?
[10:38.40]Okay.
[11:01.46]Okay, a boot?
[11:02.64]Do you remember this is a mouse pad?
[11:09.02]This is a mouse pad?
[11:14.66]I don't want this ruler anyway.
[11:15.78]Get us out of here.
[11:16.30]Dude.
[11:18.35]Okay, whatever.
[11:26.57]This doesn't go under.
[11:39.33]Okay, these are... these are bras?
[11:49.36]Perfect.
[11:58.00]Game Boy?
[11:58.38]Uh, put it on the shelf.
[12:03.27]Um... Scritchy Scratch?
[12:11.20]What is that?
[12:15.12]Files?
[12:16.30]Throw it over here.
[12:26.80]A toaster?
[12:28.06]Why do you have a toaster?
[12:30.28]Oh, because of the kitchen.
[12:31.22]Right.
[12:31.48]Hold on.
[12:38.52]To make toast.
[12:39.48]Yeah, but still.
[12:50.13]And I can hang those up.
[12:51.26]I don't think I want to do that, though.
[12:53.40]I hate hangers.
[12:54.54]They just give you two spikes on your shoulders.
[12:56.28]I hate it.
[12:57.64]But I'll do it for now.
[13:09.21]You don't know what I'm talking about?
[13:10.79]When you... Okay.
[13:12.03]When you put something on a hanger, and it sits in there for a long enough time, you end up getting this shit.
[13:18.37]It looks like this.
[13:22.44]And there's nothing you can do to get rid of it.
[13:24.22]It just looks like this.
[13:27.72]You have to wash the shirt.
[13:34.17]To get rid of it.
[13:41.35]Looks like an iPod.
[13:46.32]Get a smaller hanger.
[13:52.11]No, I'm not using a meat hook.
[14:15.26]I get this shit out of the way.
[14:16.16]I can't see.
[14:20.82]Okay.
[14:21.34]Jeans are gonna go there.
[14:24.66]Fuck.
[14:25.01]Okay, hold on.
[14:26.39]Hang up the ones that you should hang up.
[14:28.33]Fold the t-shirts.
[14:30.99]T-shirts are gonna go here.
[14:32.75]Hang this up right here.
[14:33.69]Alright.
[14:34.03]Sweaters.
[14:34.67]Wet shirts.
[14:35.99]This looks like an alarm clock.
[14:37.79]It is.
[14:39.31]Yeah.
[14:39.77]Fold up the shirts.
[14:40.77]Hang up the big ones.
[14:50.64]What is that?
[14:52.02]What is all this stuff?
[14:57.70]I think this is pants.
[14:58.44]Should I do this by color?
[15:04.69]I don't care.
[15:05.51]I genuinely don't care.
[15:11.23]I just reach in and grab clothes.
[15:12.81]I don't care.
[15:20.93]Oh, right.
[15:21.51]I got it!
[15:26.17]Is there anymore?
[15:58.85]What is all this shit?
[16:01.45]Too much stuff.
[16:02.85]I told you, like, my... I should do this the way that I would actually do my room.
[16:07.46]And I'm telling you right now, it is not like this.
[16:13.74]Just look at all the... You can't even move in here.
[16:16.32]There's no room.
[16:19.24]There's just no room to move in here.
[16:24.17]I can't breathe in this room.
[16:53.64]I don't like this up here.
[16:54.66]This needs to be... here.
[17:27.88]Okay, now what?
[17:29.41]Why is there only one shoe?
[17:34.83]Towel?
[17:38.44]What is that?
[17:38.96]What is this bag?
[17:48.67]Is it a health kit?
[18:09.68]Don't act like you don't do that.
[18:10.58]Don't act like you don't do that either.
[18:12.08]Don't act like you don't do that either.
[18:13.94]Quiet.
[18:26.58]Okay, I just gotta get stuff out of the box first.
[18:28.01]This is toothpaste.
[18:34.45]Toothpaste.
[18:36.84]This is a brush.
[18:37.54]I'm going to put this here.
[18:39.66]This is soap.
[18:40.16]We're going to put it here.
[18:41.69]Although, gross.
[18:43.19]Gross.
[18:45.01]Gross.
[18:46.55]No.
[18:47.78]I don't use that shit.
[18:48.78]I don't do that.
[18:49.90]Gross.
[19:00.80]Yeah, I don't smear around and lather up a big ball of fucking bar soap, smear it all over my body, and then place that shit on there for it to get like stuck on.
[19:16.25]And even if you use a tray, it gets just stuck on the tray.
[19:19.91]Bar soap is fucking dog shit.
[19:21.85]I'm sorry, it's dog shit.
[19:26.30]You just use a little bit of gel soap, a little bit of body wash, lather it up, scrub it up.
[19:33.83]You know what?
[19:34.59]I actually like Irish Spring for one reason.
[19:41.06]Because the guy in the commercial used to be like, this is the Irish Spring, and he would be cutting it.
[19:46.14]He had a knife and he'd be cutting the soap.
[19:49.52]And he had a... He was an Irish guy.
[19:52.30]So I was like, oh, wow!
[19:53.88]Irish spring!
[19:54.76]I thought it was actually from... a... I thought it was from a really, really rare resource in Ireland.
[20:03.81]I don't believe... I don't think that now, obviously, but when I was younger, I really thought it was a rare thing.
[20:10.13]It's like, oh, only from the finest of the Irish springs!
[20:17.20]You fell for the ads.
[20:19.20]Yeah, when I was 12.
[20:19.74]13, maybe.
[20:22.33]11.
[20:22.79]Not like I was 20, 30 years old.
[20:26.79]I thought it was some rare ingredients from some incredibly exotic place.
[20:31.65]Like deep underground in some spring.
[20:33.79]I don't know.
[20:41.44]This is like an espresso cup.
[20:49.18]How's the bathroom look?
[20:49.82]I don't like this.
[20:51.82]In fact, I don't think I even want this in here.
[20:53.86]Why do I want this?
[20:58.13]Is this deodorant?
[20:59.61]Then I guess I would sit here.
[21:10.07]I'm okay with that.
[21:17.41]Towel.
[21:23.60]What are you doing?
[21:24.18]Washing the utensils first.
[21:25.98]Because they've been in a box for probably a month.
[21:37.29]Is this... Yeah, you put the bug stuff down here.
[21:38.83]Is this a George woman?
[21:43.49]Yeah, does it go down here too?
[21:44.65]No, it would be like here.
[21:49.06]Is this a scale?
[21:52.46]Uh, put that here, because it looks alright there.
[21:54.26]Pot.
[21:55.88]Put it up here.
[22:05.17]It's a cutting board.
[22:06.43]I know.
[22:07.73]You think I didn't know?
[22:12.90]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[22:17.28]This is...
[22:22.05]I thought... Okay, this is not a poster.
[22:23.41]It's garbage bags.
[22:26.69]Sponges.
[22:30.98]Bachelor.
[22:31.40]Alright, let's get some stuff situated here.
[22:36.54]Toaster's gonna go here.
[22:38.80]Is this a dishwashing soap?
[22:40.28]And then what is this?
[22:40.92]Okay, this is hand soap, obviously.
[22:45.03]What if...
[22:47.19]Pinesol?
[22:47.81]What is that?
[22:48.19]What is this?
[22:48.87]What's the difference?
[22:50.51]Is this cooking oil?
[22:52.87]Oh, okay.
[22:53.31]Well, then it goes here.
[23:04.54]Cups.
[23:04.98]Yeah, cups that go up here.
[23:09.76]Sugar.
[23:17.27]Put the spices and shit up here.
[23:37.78]Put the money away.
[23:38.54]I don't want to advertise my money.
[23:42.27]Why would I do that?
[23:58.59]Glassware will go... Shit.
[24:17.81]Fuck.
[24:24.52]I don't want all this!
[24:39.24]Like, what is all this stuff?
[24:55.66]Bingo.
[24:56.56]Alright, hold on.
[24:59.68]Where am I gonna put all this?
[25:13.57]How am I gonna reach this shit ever?
[25:19.21]I'm never gonna be able to grab this stuff.
[25:29.69]Alright, let's be honest.
[25:36.67]I'm only gonna use this thing once a year.
[25:39.73]So let's put this stuff down here that I don't need down here.
[25:49.47]What's wrong with this?
[25:50.55]I don't get it.
[25:53.69]What's the problem?
[25:58.73]What's the problem?
[26:03.72]I can't have towels out?
[26:13.80]I put my shoes at the door.
[26:17.13]What's the issue?
[26:25.39]Alright, let's go!
[26:26.09]Let's take a look at the speedrun.
[26:33.25]Why is it so zoomed in?
[27:26.35]nice very nice 2007. oh god okay oh goodness I already have this bunch of shit all here there's already stuff here there's some shit here already can I throw some stuff away I can't move anything else
[27:56.26]I would just throw everything away.
[27:59.37]Well, I mean, I wouldn't, but, like, in the game, I mean, I wouldn't just throw everything away.
[28:04.79]I'm just saying, in the context of this video game, I would just get rid of this stuff so I could put new stuff out.
[28:11.63]You have a roommate?
[28:12.37]That makes it even worse.
[28:17.94]Can you imagine
[28:27.07]Hey, what's in the bags?
[28:29.55]Ah, nothing, man.
[28:30.15]I'm just making a couple trips to the dumpster.
[28:31.59]Not a big deal.
[28:33.21]You throw every single thing they own away.
[28:36.58]Wow, that would be awful.
[28:47.50]That's a power move.
[28:54.55]What even is this?
[28:57.64]I don't know.
[28:57.96]Put it over here for now.
[29:00.40]Close... No, I gotta... Where's the bedroom?
[29:06.08]Oh, man.
[29:06.68]This is gonna be so much of a pain in the ass.
[29:09.69]Alright, I'm gonna go fast.
[29:12.13]I can't pay attention to this.
[29:16.83]I can't do it.
[29:21.69]There's too much stuff.
[29:22.69]I can't do it.
[29:25.37]I can't.
[29:25.77]I don't care what to do with this thing.
[29:27.61]I don't want it.
[29:32.21]Put some effort into this.
[29:34.36]Guys, every time I've moved, I really sit there and look at all my stuff and go, I just want to smash all this up with a hammer and throw it in the fucking trash.
[29:42.34]I swear.
[29:43.10]Sometimes you just look around and you're just like, fuck it.
[29:45.00]Fuck this.
[29:54.49]You don't do it, but you sit there and you have this thought of just... I really would love to put this all in a trash compactor and just watch it get crushed.
[30:04.96]Okay, we need a box with pans.
[30:21.63]Look at all this!
[30:22.71]There's markers for each different day of the week!
[30:28.82]This is why I try not to own anything.
[30:33.18]I want just such a small amount of stuff.
[30:35.16]I want the stuff that makes me... Do I need it to survive?
[30:38.94]Yes.
[30:39.18]Okay.
[30:40.56]Toilet paper.
[30:41.30]You need that.
[30:42.92]You need a rag, right?
[30:44.94]You need a good rag.
[30:46.08]You need stuff for the bathroom.
[30:47.54]A toothbrush.
[30:49.69]I don't need all these books.
[30:50.51]I don't need all these things.
[30:52.37]I don't, I don't, I don't need all this other shit.
[30:56.44]I just, honestly, I just need a pan to cook food in.
[31:01.04]I just, you need to only need a few pans.
[31:04.98]Sometimes you go to kitchens and the person's like a master fucking chef.
[31:08.12]They have 15 different pans.
[31:11.34]And it's like, I don't, do you even know the last time you even used that like extra large wok?
[31:17.88]What, what do you mean?
[31:21.61]What?
[31:25.44]What's wrong with all this?
[31:29.00]You guys understand that this is almost everything I own is in here and in that closet.
[31:36.20]This is almost every object that I own.
[31:40.49]This is my whole life is this shelf here.
[31:43.43]All of my possessions are there and right there.
[31:46.01]I don't like have anything else.
[31:51.45]I keep some consoles and some games and stuff.
[31:55.11]I have three or four pans.
[31:59.58]A couch.
[32:03.38]I got a VR headset.
[32:04.66]I don't know.
[32:07.76]I don't like stuff.
[32:08.72]I don't like a bunch of stuff.
[32:10.90]Yeah, I don't know.
[32:11.33]I don't like stuff.
[32:13.31]Like, for instance, to me, this is stuff.
[32:15.11]This is stuff.
[32:16.41]I would get rid of it.
[32:18.89]Let me tell you what would go in this room.
[32:20.31]You ready?
[32:23.13]No, it's a book.
[32:23.95]Get rid of it.
[32:24.91]What am I going to write down?
[32:27.19]Alarm clock.
[32:27.95]Nope, I have a phone.
[32:29.19]I don't need that.
[32:30.29]What is this?
[32:30.93]Some random magazine?
[32:32.43]Postcard?
[32:33.56]Put it on the fridge for six months.
[32:34.90]After six months have elapsed, take it off.
[32:37.92]Oh, you sent me a picture of your kids or something.
[32:41.00]Or something like a cool thing.
[32:42.96]It's going on the fridge for six to twelve months and it's coming off.
[32:45.20]What is this?
[32:48.61]Another one.
[32:50.09]Nope, I wouldn't have any of this.
[32:53.45]I have a phone, and I don't even listen to music, so I don't need this.
[32:57.19]A hanger?
[32:57.93]You're gonna bring a hanger with you.
[32:59.23]Okay.
[33:00.08]No.
[33:03.86]What did somebody just say?
[33:05.10]Something about how I said I lived out of a shoe?
[33:09.74]Like the lady from that Mercer Rewrite?
[33:15.24]Who lived in the shoe?
[33:21.68]What is this?
[33:30.87]I want to show you guys something because it's very important.
[33:36.24]This is my mousepad.
[33:38.40]You want to see how I don't own anything?
[33:40.14]I don't care.
[33:42.08]This is my mousepad.
[33:43.74]I've been using the same mousepad for fucking almost 10 straight.
[33:46.45]This is a Magicka Wizard Wars mousepad.
[33:49.59]This is what I use.
[33:51.97]I don't play this game.
[33:53.91]I don't give a shit about this game or this entire franchise.
[33:57.25]I don't care.
[33:58.53]Magicka fucking Wizard Wars, guys.
[34:03.57]I don't need anything else.
[34:04.71]I don't need another one.
[34:07.43]Why would I get another one?
[34:08.67]What do I care?
[34:11.52]I've owned this since 2011, I think.
[34:14.92]Buy a new one.
[34:15.64]I don't need a new one!
[34:16.46]This one works!
[34:18.64]This works just fine.
[34:20.58]It's just this floppy... Oh look, I'm gonna make thunder!
[34:23.52]I don't need another one.
[34:29.37]If it were up to me, I would just do it on my shin.
[34:32.35]I mean, my thigh.
[34:34.06]If it worked.
[34:37.90]I used an Amazon Basics keyboard for five years.
[34:41.18]That thing was $9 on Amazon.
[34:44.72]I don't eat stuff.
[34:45.58]I don't care about stuff.
[34:49.90]This thing probably smells.
[34:58.15]I'll give you a real review, I promise.
[34:59.40]Um... It just... I don't know.
[35:16.96]It smells like the inside of a closet.
[35:23.66]It doesn't smell bad.
[35:25.10]It smells like...
[35:31.56]Whatever.
[35:31.97]Okay.
[35:37.05]Now I gotta put this back over here.
[35:39.23]It stinks.
[35:39.89]No, it doesn't stink.
[35:42.24]It just smells like fucking rubber.
[35:46.00]You should taste it.
[35:47.96]No, stop being childish.
[35:50.46]For God's sake.
[35:51.34]Stop being so... Alright, now underneath here, for instance.
[35:54.70]Now that's gross.
[35:55.88]Now that's just not nice.
[35:57.50]I clean this room a lot.
[35:58.72]But that's just... That's just not okay.
[36:02.40]That just looks bad.
[36:03.12]Okay.
[36:07.46]You're used to the smell.
[36:10.32]You want me to Febreze my mousepad?
[36:13.69]Guys, I have one other mousepad.
[36:19.33]And...
[36:23.14]Give me a second.
[36:23.90]I need to see if I still have it.
[36:25.37]You're gonna fucking shit your pants laughing if I can get it.
[36:27.31]I'll be right back.
[36:49.99]I got it.
[36:50.73]I got it.
[36:55.23]Okay.
[36:55.89]Are you ready?
[36:57.77]Are you ready for me to reveal the other mouse pad that I own?
[37:00.81]Okay.
[37:03.37]Here we go.
[37:27.31]It's a Superman holographic mouse pad.
[37:34.79]It's pretty cool.
[37:38.60]Should I use this instead of the... Magica Wizard Wars one?
[37:42.72]What do you think?
[37:47.12]Is this worth any money?
[37:51.34]Does it make a sound when you scratch it?
[37:55.46]What the fu-
[38:11.80]Man, it's been a rough day today.
[38:16.12]Everybody shut up.
[38:21.31]You're ruining the surface?
[38:23.41]That's the only other mousepad I own.
[38:27.23]I just don't care.
[38:33.45]I don't care.
[38:35.41]I don't own stuff.
[38:38.36]Look, I would spend money on things that are very essential that I find essential, for instance.
[38:47.81]A nice fucking meal.
[38:48.59]You know what I mean?
[38:49.51]A nice fucking delicious meal.
[39:02.36]At McDonald's.
[39:04.44]Not at McDonald's.
[39:11.25]Superman mouse pad is essential.
[39:13.25]You're acting like I bought this recently.
[39:15.23]I don't even know where I got it.
[39:30.02]You eat McDonald's and shit.
[39:33.86]Just because I eat McDonald's doesn't mean that's the only food I eat.
[39:39.06]Oh, I like McDonald's.
[39:41.53]You eat it three meals a day, every single fucking day.
[39:44.42]That's not what I said.
[39:46.04]I just said I enjoy that restaurant.
[39:55.16]Alright, what, I gotta get this, I gotta, hold on.
[40:03.41]This is some kind of tablet or something.
[40:09.59]Why do I not have the thing to put this on?
[40:13.40]Why is it?
[40:13.92]Wait, I'll make it, you know, here's the idea.
[40:16.56]You put it that far away, so then when it actually beeps, you have to get up and climb up the shit to turn it off, so you make sure you're gonna get up for it.
[40:22.78]This is all wrong.
[40:35.94]All wrong.
[40:37.46]Maybe we didn't have so much bullshit.
[40:49.28]Where the fuck am I supposed to put all this shit?
[40:57.06]Why do I have business cards out on my own desk?
[40:59.52]I know who I am.
[41:01.44]Put these away.
[41:25.94]So many books.
[41:28.54]Oh, just get the digital one.
[41:40.57]Too many books.
[41:41.41]Too many books.
[41:46.90]How come there's no end table or anything?
[41:48.38]Am I gonna just put all my stuff on the ground?
[41:56.58]Check the other side.
[42:35.74]Okay, whatever.
[42:44.29]Bottoms are going here.
[42:46.09]Tops going there.
[42:48.89]And then underwear is going in here.
[42:53.13]What a pain in the ass.
[42:55.80]Oh, this hurts me.
[42:56.94]I just hate it.
[43:00.80]Ugh.
[43:09.55]Okay, thank God.
[43:10.25]I hate it.
[43:12.13]I hate it.
[43:14.56]Ugh.
[43:17.40]Ugh, get this around it.
[43:18.16]Throw him away.
[43:18.56]What is that?
[43:42.25]This is going somewhere else.
[43:45.99]Look at all the stuff we have.
[43:48.70]You understand that we probably had 20 more encyclopedias, but they're being taken up by, like, Crunchy the Cockroach.
[43:56.75]Like a bunch of action figures.
[44:14.87]This can go back here.
[44:16.97]Come on, get back there.
[44:18.44]Can I go under the bed?
[44:19.12]That's not a bad place for it.
[44:20.92]Okay.
[44:31.47]Good, good, good.
[44:32.07]Feels good.
[44:39.61]The worst possible place to put a tower, because you can't ever touch the back of it.
[44:46.27]I hate this.
[44:47.53]I have my tower right here, and it's not enclosed by a bunch of this shit, and I still hate it.
[45:18.00]What's that?
[45:18.34]Frisbee?
[45:19.94]Hey, leave that under there for like 10 years.
[45:21.32]Is that a shoe?
[45:23.92]What is this?
[45:24.34]That's a squished up shoe.
[45:31.81]Is that a paint can?
[45:35.55]What is this?
[45:38.03]Honest to God, what is this?
[45:40.13]This looks like a Ghostbuster trap.
[45:42.26]What is this thing?
[45:51.87]What is that?
[45:55.24]It's climbing chalk?
[45:59.98]Chalk bag for climbing.
[46:07.75]Okay.
[46:19.18]No.
[46:19.74]Get back here.
[46:31.50]There's not enough room in this closet!
[46:50.30]Dude, there's no fucking room in this goddamn closet.
[47:06.68]That's a pants hanger.
[47:12.88]What is this?
[47:13.32]A yoga mat or something?
[47:34.76]This was so small when I took it out, I thought it was a PEZ container.
[47:37.43]This is a trash can.
[47:41.67]Yeah, good luck throwing one item in here and then needing to take the whole bag out.
[48:01.19]This is all fucked up.
[48:04.31]Look at all fucked up.
[48:04.99]This is fucked up.
[48:14.06]Look at all the stuff on the desk.
[48:16.52]Alright.
[48:21.58]Looking good so far.
[48:24.38]Not bad.
[48:25.97]Okay.
[48:28.43]Dining room.
[48:31.73]More books.
[48:40.25]Let's be realistic with ourselves here.
[48:42.11]Everybody that has all these books, they buy them, and they, like, open them in bed, and they read three pages, and they close it, and they just pretend like they're reading it.
[49:12.89]I knew for a fact that was gonna get somebody.
[49:15.86]People are just like, I fucking read!
[49:18.53]What is he saying?
[50:05.57]Ah, back to the living room.
[50:06.53]Alright.
[50:10.67]I would never do this.
[50:11.59]This is stupid.
[50:13.57]There's already a visual here for the television for you to look at, so putting another visual right behind it is... That's dog shit feng shui.
[50:21.94]That's bad.
[50:23.42]This is... No.
[50:24.48]Because there's another visual right behind it.
[50:27.82]This is going somewhere else.
[50:28.44]Okay.
[50:40.77]Too many visuals.
[50:41.41]Is that GameCube?
[50:48.03]Alright, here are the games.
[50:51.31]Let's get the games over here.
[50:52.15]A little blanket.
[51:31.23]Oh.
[51:34.65]All the vents are blocked?
[51:35.59]Oh my god, look at this shit.
[51:44.01]Too much stuff.
[51:54.42]There's another thing I don't know what to do with.
[51:55.62]Okay, I'm going to take this down.
[51:57.76]Can these fit up here?
[51:59.76]That can.
[52:02.86]Too much.
[52:03.85]Too many things.
[52:11.23]That works.
[52:13.39]Alright, that works.
[52:13.89]I can sit under there.
[52:14.47]Alright, kitchen.
[52:19.50]More mugs.
[52:22.26]Towel.
[52:27.64]Mug.
[52:31.67]I've been drinking out of the same coffee cups for five to ten years too.
[52:34.43]You guys have a problem with that?
[52:54.96]Yeah, as long as you wash it.
[52:56.00]Oh yeah, of course I do.
[53:03.34]What is this?
[53:05.68]Oh, it's a magnet.
[53:12.60]Have you been shitting out of the same ass?
[53:15.86]Yes.
[53:24.17]What a weird... What a weirdo.
[53:26.25]What is...
[53:58.16]Organized.
[53:58.70]This can't fit in there.
[54:09.60]Medikit.
[54:11.29]Sponges.
[54:12.75]Spatula.
[54:15.21]Spoon.
[54:17.33]Cutting board.
[54:18.71]Alright.
[54:20.21]I think this is a towel.
[54:21.31]This is going in the bathroom.
[54:27.24]Towel.
[54:30.24]Alright, toothbrush.
[54:34.46]I'm not putting my toothbrush up here.
[54:37.30]This is coming with me in the bedroom.
[54:40.46]This is coming with me in the bedroom.
[54:43.83]No, I'm sorry.
[54:44.45]I don't know.
[54:48.89]I don't know.
[54:49.25]I don't like to... I don't want to leave my shit out.
[54:52.13]When I'm done brushing my teeth, this is getting put in a little plastic bag and I'm bringing it into my bedroom.
[54:56.01]Putting it in a drawer.
[55:30.48]Holy shit, look at these!
[55:34.80]Those are, those are Costco.
[55:36.92]Those are bulk.
[55:38.16]Damn.
[55:51.29]Spray.
[55:54.77]That's horse shampoo.
[56:00.85]How much shit does this person have?
[56:02.79]That- Thank you for saying that.
[56:08.19]Thank you.
[56:09.95]Alright, so what's the problem?
[56:24.76]All of this apparently shouldn't be here.
[56:27.61]Where else are they supposed to go?
[56:28.62]You gotta put your clothes away.
[56:31.24]You gotta put your shoes away.
[56:34.36]Put your shoes away.
[56:37.18]No.
[56:38.22]Actually, my shoes are at just the front door of wherever you live.
[56:43.17]They're just at the front.
[56:49.99]I'm not putting these all in here.
[56:51.87]They're just at the front door.
[56:55.20]And these can't even fit.
[57:02.33]Alright, that's good.
[57:07.29]This looks good.
[57:09.07]Is there a problem?
[57:10.17]Kitchen's a problem.
[57:10.87]For what?
[57:13.23]Oh, sorry.
[57:13.89]My mistake.
[57:15.43]There were two towels on the counter.
[57:17.51]I'm so sorry.
[57:18.25]I will fix this immediately.
[57:23.52]God, what a bonehead.
[57:24.76]What a dumb... What an idiot.
[57:29.64]Forget about all the dirty fucking dishes in the sink.
[57:34.33]or all the other bullshit that's up here.
[57:39.74]Let's see the speedrun.
[58:07.36]Okay, so am I just really doing this at the same speed?
[58:13.43]Am I just weirdly consistent with how fast I did this?
[58:16.93]Or is it just going to put it out no matter what?
[58:41.47]Hey, you don't watch a spider make its web, you just see the end result, so please.
[58:45.27]Spare me the criticisms.
[59:06.53]Those just jumped around on their own.
[59:09.41]How do I get a better view?
[59:40.50]Hey, hey, remember this rant?
[59:43.04]God.
[59:43.46]It's like it was yesterday.
[59:44.64]2010.
[59:44.66]God.
[59:48.46]Okay.
[59:52.94]What is that?
[60:10.71]Oh, what is it?
[60:13.47]Pet bug?
[60:21.95]I can move everything.
[60:22.77]Is this mine?
[60:29.38]Why can't I move the guitars and the TV and the dumbbells?
[60:31.32]Whatever.
[60:33.75]Okay, what do we got?
[60:35.27]I have to make sure everybody knows that I play D&D.
[60:37.83]It's the first thing that I want them to see so I can have an hour-long conversation with them about D&D.
[60:44.13]They go, Hey, man, what's this thing?
[60:48.32]Oh, well, let me tell you something about Dungeons & Dragons.
[60:58.31]How much time do you have?
[61:11.78]It's like a mini guitar.
[61:12.62]Oh, is it a ukulele?
[61:16.23]Oh wow, look at this!
[61:18.91]We've got a super closet now.
[61:24.15]Perfect place for my shirts.
[61:30.30]Who's this messy person?
[61:33.20]Look at this messy bullshit.
[61:37.31]It's not a bowling alley, okay?
[61:40.35]Symmetrical and flush.
[61:52.70]It's messy.
[62:05.03]Just rip these doors off.
[62:06.95]Just take these doors off.
[62:08.27]All they do is just cause a huge problem.
[62:09.90]They're a massive pain in the ass.
[62:14.20]Those of you that have ever had to use these doors before, fuck these things.
[62:18.02]They come off the first day I move in.
[62:20.27]I don't care, without a doubt.
[62:24.87]First day.
[62:39.14]Okay.
[62:40.98]Of course, gotta bring my Game Boy everywhere I go.
[62:44.12]Are those the cigarettes?
[62:49.27]What is... what is... why do you have these?
[63:12.65]Uh-oh.
[63:14.76]How much underwear?
[63:15.82]Is this underwear?
[63:16.74]How much underwear do we have?
[63:21.82]This is kind of a lot of underwear.
[63:23.91]Are we planning on shitting our pants a lot?
[63:28.13]Are these socks?
[63:30.09]Or is it underwear?
[63:45.62]It's both?
[63:59.91]What are these?
[64:01.89]Get these fucking fruit roll-ups out of here.
[64:04.32]These are ties, I think, right?
[64:24.97]You know, Dan's gonna get mad at me for putting the shoes in the wrong place.
[64:30.70]This is why... Just grab him and, like, the Hulk rip him off.
[64:54.47]I hate these things so much.
[65:14.09]What am I supposed to do with this?
[65:15.37]I don't... This is my degree?
[65:20.15]What am I supposed to do with this?
[65:21.49]There's no way for me to hang this.
[65:25.03]I was gonna put my degree in the bathroom.
[65:26.72]I don't care.
[65:44.83]That's where it belongs.
[65:53.14]these shoes are all mismatched I don't care it doesn't belong alright let me take these are markers I think I'll put these back here look at this mess of a living room come on

[67:15.04]There just really is.
[67:15.84]I'm sorry.
[67:16.34]I know that like a lot of people like books and stuff so that I don't like books.
[67:19.83]I just, they take up a lot of space.
[67:42.46]This is important, though.
[67:43.38]I would say this is very important.
[67:44.78]That's the most important thing that I packed.
[67:47.42]Is the chicken thing.
[67:48.53]Let's put this in the bedroom.
[68:02.30]If I could move it, I would.
[68:13.18]Look at all these!
[68:14.68]What the fuck are these all for?
[68:17.56]Why, who has that many of those?
[68:21.64]This is bullshit.
[68:22.99]Everybody that owns more than one of these, you go, you fan, you see five to ten pages with shit on it.
[68:30.89]The rest is empty.
[68:32.73]And it's like that across every single one of them.
[68:34.85]You don't need all these.
[68:40.42]The first five pages have stuff on this, and the rest is blank.
[68:44.49]There's sketchbooks.
[68:51.02]There's a lot!
[68:52.84]You don't know how to read.
[68:54.08]You don't know how art works.
[68:56.22]Is it artist?
[68:58.26]But I mean... I... There's a lot of books!
[69:10.03]Look at all these large cheese pizzas that I have to put across my whole house!
[69:15.87]Think about that.
[69:17.41]I have to find room for like 25 Pizza Hut boxes.
[69:41.35]And by the way, how dare you be this talented?
[69:43.51]How dare you be this talented and have that much material?
[69:58.98]There's another pizza.
[70:00.72]I don't know where to put this other pizza.
[70:14.00]Here comes a backpedal.
[70:22.54]Did you guys hear that?
[70:23.14]What the fuck was that?
[70:28.83]That sound was coming from, like, speakers.
[70:30.53]That was weird.
[70:54.62]Yeah, what time is it?
[70:57.50]6.23.
[70:57.66]No, I... I'm so confused.
[71:09.56]I'm sorry.
[71:15.20]I bet this is a GameCube house.
[71:18.43]We're gonna put this one in the closet.
[71:38.46]I don't fucking want this thing.
[71:39.91]Just get rid of it.
[71:40.45]I don't care.
[71:40.99]Okay.
[71:53.83]Cookies, important.
[72:04.62]Measuring, uh, tablespoons?
[72:12.61]What was that?
[72:14.93]Molasses?
[72:19.70]Oil.
[72:22.12]Oil.
[72:26.18]Garlic powder.
[72:27.87]Thyme.
[72:34.73]Has this one been here for more than six months?
[72:49.55]I gotta- is there a place I can put this?
[72:57.03]What even is this?
[72:57.57]Is this leftovers?
[72:59.71]Why do I have, like, takeout still?
[73:02.37]Throw this away!
[73:02.95]Alright, salt and pepper are gonna be on the table.
[73:12.86]Is this coffee, I think?
[73:13.98]Whatever.
[73:17.35]What is this?
[73:17.97]Is this a marijuana scale?
[73:21.47]What are you doing?
[73:22.21]What is this?
[73:22.79]Why is this here?
[73:23.26]What is this for?
[73:23.84]Is this not a juicer?
[73:29.48]Is this a cooking scale?
[73:41.08]By a show of hands, one being yes, two being no, do you have a cooking scale in your house?
[73:46.80]And have you used it?
[73:48.38]One is yes.
[73:49.70]Two is no.
[73:50.38]Fucking liars.
[73:51.12]No way.
[73:51.98]Liars.
[73:52.94]Lie.
[73:54.06]Lie.
[73:54.70]Lie.
[73:55.58]I see a liars.
[73:56.68]I don't see anything but liars.
[73:59.10]You've used one of these on a regular cooking scale?
[74:08.40]I have never, like, sprinkled shit on a cooking scale and weighed it out to exact.
[74:13.77]No, you just eyeball that shit!
[74:18.35]It's not for cooking?
[74:25.05]It's for baking.
[74:31.03]But just follow the recipe!
[74:33.72]I need one tablespoon of baking soda.
[74:40.06]Here it is.
[74:41.42]Do I need to put that on the scale?
[74:54.79]Do you cook often?
[74:56.23]I do cook, but I don't weigh my fucking cheeseburger patties on a marijuana weed scale.
[75:01.99]I've never heard of people doing this.
[75:11.39]Yeah, guys, I make, like, turkey sandwiches.
[75:14.02]I don't weigh the deli meat and go, I need to make sure I have at least 0.2 grams of turkey meat.
[75:20.28]I make eggs.
[75:21.36]I just crack the eggs in the pan and fucking eat them.
[75:25.56]If I'm going to be baking, I just bake cookies.
[75:27.80]I don't need to... What am I weighing?
[75:29.64]What am I weighing it for?
[75:30.64]What's it for?
[75:32.66]That's not cooking.
[75:35.14]If I bake salmon in the oven, I don't need to weigh... What am I using it for?
[75:47.22]Dude, it's sad what you're saying.
[75:53.10]Volumetric baking.
[75:56.22]Okay, but if you don't bake, you don't need one of these.
[76:01.00]I just, like, making pasta is pasta.
[76:03.58]Making a salad, I just make the salad.
[76:05.10]I just cut up some tomatoes and fucking onions.
[76:06.86]Red onions.
[76:07.76]Squirrel it around.
[76:08.78]Put it in the thing.
[76:09.34]Press the button so it spins, spins, spins, spins.
[76:11.12]Like a merry-go-round.
[76:14.01]I would put, if I, I'm gonna put a whole turkey in the oven.
[76:15.97]You just put a turkey in the oven.
[76:26.59]It's for baking recipes.
[76:27.79]I don't bake.
[76:31.29]I don't bake?
[76:34.65]What does it do?
[76:35.05]Shave onions.
[76:36.07]Into the pan.
[76:37.03]Mushrooms.
[76:37.77]Chop up the mushrooms.
[76:38.91]Chop the onions up.
[76:40.07]Get it in there.
[76:40.61]Swirl it around.
[76:41.09]Swivel it around.
[76:42.35]Put a little bit of oil in there.
[76:43.51]Cook up the mushrooms and onions.
[76:46.19]Get those cooked out to perfection.
[76:47.57]Make them nice and caramelized.
[76:49.11]Put them over on the other side.
[76:50.31]Put the steak in there.
[76:53.69]Two minutes.
[76:54.81]Two minutes.
[76:58.20]Put that on top.
[76:59.58]Little bit of A1.
[77:02.13]Chopped salad.
[77:03.77]Chop it up.
[77:07.55]I'm not weighing that.
[77:08.43]Alright, you're distracting me.
[77:26.82]Yeah, Jerma A1.
[77:27.76]Get it.
[77:31.16]Bang.
[77:31.62]I've been wanting to talk about this for like a week.
[77:34.32]Two, maybe three weeks.
[77:36.10]Guys.
[77:37.72]Five Guys is 100 times better than Shake Shack.
[77:44.25]A hundred fucking times better.
[77:47.01]I don't know what happened, and I'm going to be really honest with you.
[77:49.89]Five Guys fell off for me five years ago or so.
[77:56.35]Shake Shack was number one.
[77:58.32]Best ever.
[78:00.02]I'm telling you right now, Five Guys has improved in quality while Shake Shack has gone way fucking down in quality.
[78:07.32]Five Guys is now all the way up at the top.
[78:09.91]They are number one for me.
[78:13.25]Seriously, I'm not kidding.
[78:14.25]I don't know what happened over the last four or five years.
[78:19.00]Shake Shack... I have to be honest.
[78:21.00]This is just a review of that restaurant.
[78:23.00]It sucks.
[78:24.66]It sucks now.
[78:25.66]What happened?
[78:26.58]Why?
[78:27.18]What happened?
[78:27.62]I don't know what happened.
[78:29.96]I've had Shake Shack from more than one location.
[78:32.91]More than a few locations.
[78:36.67]It was kind of bad.
[78:40.39]It really wasn't that... Okay, I got lettuce on a Shake Shack burger, and I'm not... I wish I took a picture of it, because it was fucking ridiculous.
[78:48.43]It was one tiny, wilted, small, thin piece of wilted, wet, gross lettuce.
[78:57.15]I'm being honest.
[78:57.77]I have to be honest with you.
[79:00.23]I went to Five Guys, and I got lettuce, and it was this crunchy, crispy, like... It was packed full of flavor and juices and stuff.
[79:09.56]Oh my God, it was so good.
[79:11.52]And I used to think Shake Shack was the best.
[79:14.82]And I thought that Five Guys was okay, but something happened in the last few years.
[79:18.78]It's probably the best takeout burger.
[79:23.30]The tomato.
[79:24.96]If I were to have it.
[79:25.76]Which I don't have it on my burgers, but if I did.
[79:29.51]So crunchy and so just full of just juicy, delicious, fresh flavor.
[79:34.85]They flipped.
[79:50.82]bed I don't care what do we do with these controllers we have too many systems what do these even go okay four is actually not a bad amount now we have two systems okay what is this what are these things
[80:28.02]What do I do with this record player?
[80:31.94]Just keep... Everyone puts them here anyways.
[80:33.58]It's fine.
[80:42.13]But seriously, Five Guys.
[80:44.19]I don't know what you did.
[80:47.19]The burgers are fucking on point.
[80:49.61]Better than anywhere else.
[81:06.23]Not very much storage.
[81:07.11]You know what I mean?
[81:14.06]Like, I don't... Where am I supposed to put this?
[81:19.00]There's way too much stuff on the counter.
[81:21.95]How are you supposed to prepare food on this counter?
[81:28.26]You better be throwing pizzas in the air.
[81:30.49]Because you're not going to have any room for anything.
[82:24.38]I don't know what to do with that.
[82:39.27]Toothbrush, let's go.
[82:41.51]Nail clipper, let's go.
[82:44.17]Shaving razor, let's go.
[82:49.20]Mug.
[82:57.45]Hair gel.
[82:59.60]Febreze.
[83:13.39]Medicine?
[83:28.63]Oh my god, what is all this?
[84:12.54]Okay.
[84:51.83]But RichStreamer has never unpacked in his life that he gets his manservants to do it for him.
[85:02.25]No, that's not accurate.
[85:05.47]That's not accurate.
[85:11.42]I just don't care about other people's stuff.
[85:14.22]This is not my stuff.
[85:16.33]This is not my stuff, so I don't care.
[85:18.59]I don't care about your dumb green toaster, alright?
[85:21.69]If this was my toaster, I would want to put it somewhere special.
[85:25.13]What is a razor doing in here?
[85:32.86]There's no room for anything.
[85:37.70]Where is the Febreze supposed to go?
[85:49.49]Why is this so... Why is everything so wrong?
[85:55.92]There's nowhere to put... I can't put anything anywhere.
[86:01.28]A Febreze goes in any room.
[86:03.79]Okay?
[86:04.87]I don't understand.
[86:05.89]This is stupid to me, because considering... Like, how many times have you fought it in a room?
[86:10.96]And, holy shit, you hear somebody walking down the hallway.
[86:14.32]Like, I don't know, your girlfriend.
[86:16.90]You know, like, you know, a few days ago.
[86:20.36]And you hear the footsteps, and you just laid out a fucking gross one.
[86:25.11]And if there was one in the bedroom right there... Done.
[86:31.01]It can... It's for any room.
[86:33.60]It's literally for any room.
[86:34.84]There's no room it has to be in.
[86:38.37]Oh, he farted.
[86:38.99]Yeah, that's funny.
[86:41.67]Where does it want me to put this?
[86:43.57]Does anybody have any idea where it wants me?
[86:45.95]Where does it want this to go?
[86:49.77]Where does it want this to go?
[86:50.67]Okay.
[87:08.16]I can't even put this anywhere.
[87:27.61]Why can't it... Leave it where it was?
[87:33.24]I can't put it anywhere.
[87:42.90]What do I do with this?
[87:50.90]This is a laptop.
[87:53.44]How is this place worse than the last one?
[87:55.71]There's less room than the last one.
[87:57.63]Where's this supposed to go?
[87:58.25]What the fuck am I supposed to do with this?
[88:13.29]Are you missing another room?
[88:14.61]I don't think so.
[88:18.46]The side table?
[88:21.70]Well, that makes sense.
[88:22.48]Okay, but what about the Etch-A-Sketch?
[88:27.88]I would think, like, right here, right?
[88:29.38]No.
[88:34.62]No.
[88:43.60]I don't even have a desk.
[88:47.54]I don't have a desk.
[88:48.36]I've got plenty of fucking underwear.
[88:51.16]Where's the desk?
[89:21.17]Throw it into the river.
[89:28.97]Come on.
[89:30.15]Oh, you piece of shit.
[90:09.21]Okay.
[90:15.29]This one's good.
[90:16.27]We're good.
[90:20.22]What am I... I don't understand what it wants me to do with these.
[90:23.16]They can't go anywhere.
[90:24.04]I can't put them up anywhere.
[90:24.90]How is this not in the right spot?
[91:23.88]Why?
[91:27.93]On the coffee table in the living room?
[91:32.00]That's kind of in the way.
[91:33.58]That takes up a... That's in the way, right?
[91:37.82]Am I crazy?
[92:01.00]Fuck.
[92:10.89]Why don't care?
[92:24.43]What's wrong with these?
[92:28.29]Okay, that looks alright.
[92:30.74]Although weird.
[92:31.54]I would put them over here in a place to store them.
[92:37.11]I think that's good.
[92:38.93]Alright, now we just need to fix the bedroom.
[92:43.93]Right, my degree.
[92:46.54]Which I don't know where it wants me to put it.
[93:02.01]Under the bed.
[93:05.16]Under the bed?
[93:05.88]They're supposed to be sad?
[93:34.46]I remember this rant.
[93:53.97]I was just picking it up and putting it down for like a fucking full five minutes.
[94:01.66]Jesus.
[94:29.87]I'm just angry.
[94:37.19]Got it.
[94:41.56]Feels so serious moving into his place.
[94:43.12]Alright, so now what?
[94:44.00]2012.
[94:45.48]What's this?
[95:04.96]What am I doing here?
[95:12.62]One pound weights.
[95:37.33]Oh, we got a DS?
[95:38.07]No, we don't have just a Game Boy Advance DS!
[95:58.70]I can stay here, I think.
[96:01.04]On the bed, maybe?
[96:28.85]There it is!
[96:29.31]I'm putting the degree back up.
[96:40.90]What is this?
[96:54.43]Are these cartridges?
[97:14.52]That's better.
[97:46.53]What is that?
[97:47.03]Why do you look so scary?
[98:01.32]I don't know, man.
[98:01.88]The light is on me.
[98:08.30]Medikit?
[98:27.28]Alright.
[98:31.51]Okay.
[98:44.61]He looks a bit scary.
[98:45.69]What the fuck are you talking about?
[98:46.83]What are you talking about?
[98:49.67]I'm just sitting here.
[98:56.28]Yo, he does look a bit scary.
[99:12.07]Alright.
[99:13.41]That was a quick one.
[99:14.29]What's wrong with my eyes?
[99:16.91]Um...
[99:38.58]What's wrong with this?
[99:39.18]Why do I have to take this off?
[99:49.47]Throw it away.
[100:08.51]That's a way, right?
[100:12.94]Oh, I got it.
[100:17.78]Don't piss him off, guys.
[100:18.73]He'll yell again.
[100:19.47]I'm not gonna yell.
[100:20.87]This room used to feel bigger.
[100:43.38]Game's not even hard.
[100:46.98]Give me a fucking challenge.
[100:47.88]2013.
[100:47.90]This is a big one.
[100:49.04]Alright, how fast do you think I can do it?
[101:12.50]You know, I was just told if you really want to make moving around and opening boxes and putting stuff on shelves and stuff, do it to a song.
[102:38.87]Isn't this fun?
[102:52.66]Okay, so I got everything out of the boxes.
[102:54.04]You can do the rest.
[102:55.54]I'll be back.
[103:01.02]Why is there a cane?
[103:07.96]Am I old?
[103:13.80]Alright, let me- let me rethink this because obviously that was just, uh, while laughing out fucking loud.
[103:39.42]I've always put these things at the highest possible level.
[103:53.86]All the video games are going on the bottom shelf.
[103:57.80]It's just easier to keep track of.
[104:12.40]Any more stray video games?
[104:14.02]Yep.
[104:16.31]Perfect.
[104:22.65]I want the chickens in the bedroom.
[104:40.30]Sort them by console.
[104:42.79]No, you sort them by time played.
[104:46.39]Not by console, by... There's a bug in here.
[104:48.09]Where is it?
[104:49.15]That was weird.
[104:49.55]No, it wasn't.
[104:50.59]It was a floating piece of dust.
[104:51.83]That was fucking terrifying.
[104:53.91]It just swooped into my... That was weird.
[104:57.53]It's by time played.
[104:58.87]On what game?
[105:01.81]I'm sorry.
[105:02.79]That's the way it is.
[105:03.43]I don't know what that is.
[105:24.68]Okay.
[105:26.28]Frog.
[105:26.78]You can sit over here.
[105:28.35]I want the chickens in the bedroom.
[105:40.62]What's the fastest way to get him over there?
[105:58.75]This is going to look really stupid when we see the fast motion one.
[106:07.23]The ukulele has a stand?
[106:11.81]Where?
[106:13.75]That's a ukulele stand?
[106:15.03]I thought that was just like a piece of woodworking.
[106:16.77]I didn't think it actually had a purpose.
[106:20.80]I thought that was just a piece of art.
[106:23.80]I didn't know that actually had a purpose.
[106:25.96]Okay, it does.
[106:37.67]Not bad.
[106:40.20]Oh, no.
[106:41.16]No thanks.
[106:42.99]I'll do the computer room.
[107:08.10]There's gonna be so many books.
[107:09.56]There's gonna be so many books.
[107:15.89]I'm not just talking about these, I'm talking about these two.
[107:19.21]I'm talking about just all the books.
[107:26.52]What is that?
[107:38.21]Laptop.
[107:38.55]Tablet.
[107:40.38]Book.
[107:42.46]Book.
[108:16.31]book book book book book book whale two whales
[108:51.99]What the fuck?
[108:52.77]You have so many of these.
[108:59.44]A fax machine?
[109:08.84]Book.
[109:11.82]Cards.
[109:14.00]Wi-Fi router.
[109:17.96]Clock.
[109:19.50]Alright, let's organize this, please.
[109:37.82]I don't know.
[109:38.34]I don't even know what these are.
[109:40.68]What is this?
[109:45.51]What is this thing?
[109:52.13]That's a scanner and printer.
[109:53.35]What is this?
[109:55.94]Printer and scanner?
[109:58.78]So I have a scanner-printer combo and then a printer-scanner combo.
[110:02.44]Why are they detached?
[110:06.34]What year is this supposed to be?
[110:07.54]They were connected, always.
[110:08.75]For like the last 10 years.
[110:17.61]Printer scanner combos existed since like 2005.
[110:19.67]One is the scanner, one is the printer.
[110:26.08]Well, printer scanner combos were... Yeah, they existed in 2013.
[110:28.30]Yes, they did.
[110:37.98]Yes, they did.
[110:38.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:40.13]Yes, they did.
[110:40.66]La, la, la, la.
[111:12.15]Those individual cookies?
[111:13.51]Oh, they're coasters.
[111:15.86]Alright.
[112:30.69]Oh, fuck.
[112:31.52]A curveball.
[113:36.42]One of the reasons why I just... I know that... Oh, you have a bunch of spices in your spice rack.
[113:43.16]I kind of just want to consolidate them all into one bottle.
[113:47.89]Does that make sense?
[113:49.35]Just combine half the spices I have into one fucking bottle.
[113:52.45]Because it's all going on anyways.
[115:06.23]Come on, I can fit the strainer in here.
[115:08.63]How does it not fit in there?
[115:12.67]You can't be serious, right?
[115:14.81]Oh, shut up.
[115:16.60]Stop.
[115:17.52]No.
[115:18.06]Stop it.
[115:18.38]What are you doing?
[115:19.58]What are you doing to my Wellington?
[115:21.24]Stop it.
[115:24.04]Stop.
[115:24.28]What are you doing?
[116:02.28]That's good.
[116:04.63]Do you drink oil?
[116:07.48]No, I put olive oil in a lot of foods though.
[116:09.80]That's really good.
[116:11.21]Don't say that!
[116:31.69]You can only microwave ramen noodles?
[116:33.86]That's not even true, man.
[117:28.03]There it is finally.
[117:28.97]It only took like two hours to get to the scale.
[118:11.36]Yes.
[118:51.18]It's a linen ball?
[118:52.78]What is this?
[118:53.54]Oh, okay.
[118:55.98]What is this?
[118:56.52]This looks alright.
[118:58.69]Alright, this is going to be for underwear.
[119:07.13]More books.
[119:13.40]I'm just putting the books right here.
[119:14.86]I'm going to put every book over there and I'll figure it out later.
[119:19.90]All shirts, all pants are going over here.
[119:30.57]Whatever the hell this thing is.
[119:50.33]Okay.
[119:50.61]I love how seriously he's taking this.
[119:55.07]Yeah, I am.
[119:55.93]I mean, I'm taking it dead seriously.
[119:57.21]Alright, get the other box open.
[120:09.71]I gotta make sure I get this right.
[120:10.67]I don't want to screw this up.
[120:15.09]Candle?
[120:33.42]Put the hangers up.
[121:22.10]I'm concentrating.
[121:25.81]There's just no order here.
[121:28.05]There doesn't have to be.
[121:30.64]I operate in chaos.
[122:10.08]What happened?
[122:13.26]Nothing.
[122:14.08]Is there another bedroom?
[122:35.93]No.
[122:36.33]Okay.
[122:37.39]Some of this shit's wrong.
[122:40.43]I wanted to get the Wi-Fi router out of the way.
[122:44.91]How's that wrong?
[122:52.76]The microwave can't be over here.
[122:55.62]So where else is it supposed to go?
[122:58.04]Where would you want me to put the microwave here?
[123:00.50]There's no room for it.
[123:03.11]How is it supposed to go anywhere?
[123:04.11]Now where's the toaster go?
[123:10.66]Where's the toaster supposed to go now?
[123:35.81]How is it wrong?
[123:36.57]It's a fucking towel!
[123:38.71]Oh.
[123:54.59]This is right?
[123:57.29]What's wrong here?
[123:57.93]Okay.
[124:08.82]This bedroom has something wrong?
[124:11.48]Oh, book.
[124:15.64]Got it.
[124:25.02]I thought this was The Sims for one second.
[124:37.71]That looks good.
[125:00.43]This game's really fun.
[125:01.31]There's something about it.
[125:02.99]I don't know.
[125:03.53]I'm not really talking that much, but I'm just kind of having a good time.
[125:08.18]I'm just enjoying it.
[125:15.40]You manipulated too much.
[125:18.28]Not really.
[125:19.06]Come on.
[125:20.02]Maybe a little.
[125:20.44]2015.
[125:20.78]Now what?
[125:33.34]Is it the same place?
[125:42.82]Oh, these are cute.
[125:56.97]Those are cute.
[126:00.34]Those are coasters?
[126:01.86]I want those.
[126:02.90]Those are cute.
[126:13.79]They actually really are.
[126:15.13]They don't... Don't act like you don't think it is.
[126:40.24]I love these.
[126:40.83]I really do.
[127:14.78]Get him some fruit coasters.
[127:15.86]I would love them.
[127:17.52]I'm probably going to get them.
[127:18.62]I'm probably going to go get the fruit coasters.
[127:22.23]Wherever I can get them.
[127:27.29]These are comfy.
[127:33.34]This is comfy.
[127:33.98]I like this.
[127:37.70]What are these little games?
[127:39.10]I've got no room for these.
[127:50.42]Whoa.
[127:57.19]Book.
[127:58.65]Book.
[127:59.97]Book.
[128:00.53]Book.
[128:00.77]I don't care.
[128:03.49]I don't want... I don't read.
[128:04.73]I really don't.
[128:07.15]Does the living room door just go to the outside?
[128:08.97]Yeah, I think it's an apartment?
[128:18.29]This is... This is dumb.
[128:23.56]All my shit is here.
[128:25.00]Oh, wait, I'm adding more.
[128:27.68]Okay, I understand now.
[128:29.06]I was like, wait, what the hell am I doing?
[128:31.82]I get it.
[129:28.97]all the clothes.
[129:29.77]I am mixing up all of the clothes.
[129:33.03]I'm just putting them in random places.
[129:34.59]I'm not even... Whatever.
[129:41.28]What is that?
[129:41.74]Are these walkie-talkies?
[130:18.84]What do I do with this?
[130:19.66]What is that?
[130:22.96]Alright, close all this up.
[130:31.70]I can't see.
[130:36.99]Where do I put this?
[130:37.91]There's not enough room in the closet to put this.
[130:47.59]At least I have to go under the bed or something.
[131:04.62]Have you filed as a furry for tax purposes?
[131:06.46]I think you... Whatever.
[131:42.44]Done.
[131:42.62]Okay, this looks alright.
[131:49.60]Kitchen needs a little bit more stuff.
[131:52.41]Put this up on the sill.
[131:55.85]Alright, this is where it's going to get hard here.
[131:57.27]It actually is.
[132:01.71]Put the cups out.
[132:02.76]What is this?
[132:04.40]A gigantic cheese grater?
[132:09.76]I don't... I don't... This... What is this?
[132:17.17]What is this?
[132:19.69]What is that?
[132:20.13]A juicer?
[132:22.07]We don't need a juicer.
[132:23.83]We don't need one of these.
[132:42.11]Ice cream scoop?
[132:42.73]That's a great addition, actually.
[133:05.95]Okay, these go... I don't know where to put this.
[133:10.50]Up top?
[133:10.98]I mean, it has to.
[133:11.92]I don't... Where do I put this?
[133:17.38]What do I do with this?
[133:19.04]There's no counter space.
[133:32.29]There's no space to put anything.
[133:40.45]It's gonna have to do for now.
[133:42.33]I'll figure it out later.
[133:43.01]There's no room.
[134:02.86]We don't have enough room.
[134:04.16]There's not enough room for all this.
[134:06.76]I don't have enough room for all these salves.
[134:11.98]These gels, I don't have enough room for them.
[134:16.94]This is too- I don't have enough space.
[134:34.07]Okay, towels can go over here.

[136:40.52]You know what's gonna... I'm gonna knock this over.
[136:44.52]If this is on my bedside, I'm gonna have a bottle of water or something here.
[136:49.43]And I'm gonna go reach to get the bottle of water and it's gonna annoy me and I'm gonna knock the plant over.
[136:52.97]Alright, what do I do with this thing?
[137:04.04]Can this fit in here anywhere?
[137:08.08]There we go.
[137:17.80]I can't just go on the bed.
[137:18.64]There's a book in here.
[137:23.78]Get this book out of here.
[137:36.70]Oh my god.
[137:48.73]What the fuck?
[137:49.33]There's so much shit in this room!
[137:50.81]If I abuse this desk, I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
[137:56.16]Look at this.
[137:58.12]I can't even move.
[137:59.10]I can't exist in this room.
[138:15.73]Okay, got it.
[138:17.49]Kitchen.
[138:21.36]Where do I put this?
[138:46.39]I am like throwing this across- I'm throwing this into the trash from across the room right now.
[139:20.86]What do you don't like about this?
[139:21.76]I got it.
[139:30.06]The wooden thing is a relaxing game.
[139:32.42]It is.
[139:32.76]This is a little shitty.
[139:35.15]This was not a good one, I will say.
[139:40.05]This wasn't a great one.
[139:53.17]If my nine year old sister was playing this yesterday, she was doing better than you.
[140:02.45]How long did it take her to place one object? 2018.
[140:26.87]Well, this place is huge.
[140:53.30]Nice.
[140:58.39]Nice.
[140:59.71]Nice first try.
[141:03.83]I'm getting this absolutely first try.
[141:05.25]Look at that placement already.
[141:21.20]We're good.
[141:22.28]Let's take this up to the bathroom.
[141:27.57]Bingo.
[141:28.21]Check it out.
[141:35.23]Hand sanitizer.
[141:36.11]A bowl of fruit.
[141:41.81]Another towel.
[141:43.78]Easy.
[141:45.18]Done deal.
[141:46.50]Done.
[141:47.58]Alright.
[141:52.96]This is a books.
[141:55.60]I'm going to decorate up here.
[142:07.27]Okay, looks good.
[142:18.56]I mean, put the baby toys in the baby bed, right?
[142:55.87]Some cream?
[143:00.42]Looks good.
[143:05.04]The ba- what?
[143:29.62]It might be a little excessive, I agree.
[143:31.92]But I'm just barely functioning.
[143:36.56]I'm just figuring it out.
[143:40.53]I'm getting it all in the same spot so I know where to put it.
[143:43.63]And this is not going to be the end result.
[144:15.98]Okay.
[144:20.10]Where should I put this?
[144:32.37]Wow, look at all this baby stuff!
[144:48.63]What happened?
[144:49.93]And I'm a little embarrassed, but whatever.
[144:53.05]I'm putting the clothes on the bookshelf and the books on the clothes rack.
[144:57.59]I don't care.
[144:59.39]It doesn't matter.
[145:04.18]It doesn't matter.
[145:05.38]It's fine.
[145:09.58]Too many plants.
[145:12.00]There are too many plants.
[145:13.42]There are way too many plants.
[145:14.68]I'm just going to be honest with you.
[145:17.23]Do you have too many plants?
[145:18.97]What?
[146:20.96]I fucking hate this box.
[146:24.36]This box has been a pain in the ass at every single level.
[146:28.61]I hate this thing.
[146:31.93]I can't, I don't know how to put it ever.
[146:33.35]I hate this box.
[146:36.44]I don't want this fishing tackle box.
[146:40.22]It's annoying to use.
[147:03.04]Somehow we're getting more chickens.
[147:07.70]How do they keep increasing?
[147:14.24]They keep increasing.
[147:21.10]Oh man, this gives me anxiety.
[147:23.42]I hate this.
[147:26.12]I can't do clothing, big closet or something.
[147:29.53]No, no, no.
[147:30.37]I just have five Star Wars shirts, four pairs of jeans, a suit, and a bunch of fucking cartoon shirts.
[147:39.36]I can't do this.
[147:55.72]I have... I mean, look at this.
[147:57.80]This is like a nice shirt.
[147:58.70]This is fine.
[147:59.80]It's a nice veen.
[148:00.40]I've got five of these, six of these.
[148:02.24]I've got like seven or eight pairs of jeans.
[148:14.81]Different colors.
[148:15.35]Some slacks.
[148:18.45]You're speaking gibberish?
[148:20.64]What do you mean?
[148:21.14]What?
[148:21.28]What?
[148:34.53]Man, I gotta get some of these boxes out of the fuckin' way.
[149:06.81]Get up there!
[149:07.39]Huh?
[149:25.96]Why can I hang these?
[149:50.70]I was gonna put the pants on the bottom and the shirts on top.
[149:55.65]But I don't care anymore.
[150:39.38]It's such a mess.
[150:41.56]It's just that all their clothes are all over the place.
[150:43.24]They're not even color coordinated or anything.
[150:51.41]It's such a mess.
[150:55.97]I'm not a designer.
[150:56.93]I'm not a designer, alright?
[151:11.14]You're just lazy?
[151:13.22]I'm not lazy.
[151:14.16]I don't know where things are supposed to go in a big walk-in closet.
[151:23.08]I just... Underwear goes in the underwear slot.
[151:26.05]Shirts go in the shirt slot.
[151:28.55]Pants go wherever you want.
[151:30.89]Anywhere.
[151:32.87]At the end of the day, as long as you just kind of know where your clothes are, does it really matter that much?
[151:38.89]As long as you know where your stuff is.
[151:41.24]And it's not a mess if it was clean in here.
[151:42.96]Of course, there's a fucking book in here.
[152:08.56]Of course there's a goddamn book in there.
[152:11.64]They have so many books that's in the bathroom boxes.
[152:18.30]It's in the clothes boxes.
[152:19.91]You have too many books.
[152:25.15]Alright, where was I?
[152:29.27]Oh shit, not bad.
[153:08.42]Was that cookie tin?
[153:14.80]I don't think... I think it's a sewing kit.
[153:17.58]I think this is a sewing kit.
[153:22.36]Yeah, this is definitely for sewing.
[153:26.76]Oh, shoot.
[153:31.10]Hiding something here.
[153:56.23]This all can't fit over there.
[154:01.40]Alright, bathroom time.
[154:25.90]I thought that was a wishbone.
[154:33.50]One of those sinks.
[154:35.24]One of the sinks that has the lime in her flow.
[154:41.26]This is definitely one of those sinks.
[154:42.46]I love it.
[154:53.80]How do you say it?
[154:54.98]Yeah, laminar.
[154:56.12]Laminar flow, yeah.
[154:57.65]I learned.
[154:58.91]I paid attention last time you talked.
[155:02.03]I heard what you said.
[155:02.87]I don't want this thing.
[155:56.80]Oh, look.
[155:58.70]Oh, look.
[156:05.32]Oh, that's cute.
[156:20.27]Yeah, these are cool.
[156:37.22]Oh, look!
[156:40.36]Oh, look!
[156:41.70]Oh, look!
[156:55.60]Oh, look.
[156:57.38]Oh, look.
[157:15.07]Oh, look.
[157:38.15]How many copies of this book do you need?
[157:41.63]How many copies of this book do you have?
[157:43.96]That's a lot.
[157:44.52]That's a lot of copies of the same book.
[158:10.29]It's a published book.
[158:13.94]Let's go.
[158:40.40]There's so much shit on this desk.
[159:17.59]Hey.
[159:27.35]Hey, look.
[159:32.42]Alright, living room time.
[159:39.74]Observation, humor, Andy.
[159:40.89]I feel like I haven't talked in like an hour.
[160:07.07]Wiimotes always go on top in front of the TV.
[160:09.27]They never go inside of any storage.
[160:10.81]They're always in front of the TV, so you're ready to game.
[160:13.27]Anyone that comes in your house always knows you're ready for the Wii.
[160:18.13]The Wiimotes on top of a certain visible area is a prop.
[160:22.43]It's a set for your house.
[160:25.52]It's a way to start a conversation.
[160:27.70]It's a way to get gaming immediately.
[160:33.34]These are not out of the way.
[160:34.58]They're there very much by design.
[161:16.53]This goes in the kitchen, right?
[161:54.76]I need the... Anything that holds that.
[161:57.03]Oh, my favorite part.
[162:29.88]I'm fixing it.
[162:31.19]I know people are freaking out right now.
[162:32.69]They're in the wrong spot.
[162:33.73]They're in the wrong spot.
[162:34.73]I got it under control.
[162:44.99]And next person that says, wrong spot, Andy.
[162:46.75]I'd hate to be you.
[162:51.24]It's called timeout.
[163:19.23]We have so many games.
[163:30.35]We have a shitload of games.
[163:41.67]Oh my goodness.
[163:44.56]I don't have enough room for any of this stuff.
[164:05.15]Okay.
[164:06.41]Um, the cane.
[164:07.25]Where do I put the cane?
[164:11.70]Figure it out later.
[164:14.28]You look a little pale.
[164:17.10]It's probably for the white balance.
[164:19.12]I got a big bright-ass light in my face.
[164:27.74]I can't see.
[164:28.62]I gotta get these two boxes out of here.
[164:32.82]Ugh.
[164:34.38]Glassware up here.
[164:38.68]Bulware up here.
[164:47.47]I need to get the boxes out of the way.
[164:58.75]I can't see without moving it.
[165:23.30]Okay, now I can see.
[165:24.22]Let's get some stuff situated.
[165:25.58]Okay.
[165:43.44]Shit.
[165:44.02]Alright, move this out of the way.
[165:45.34]We'll put these here.
[165:53.02]These all go together.
[165:54.04]Alright, I'm going to put these up here.
[165:55.02]This gets the toy truck out of the way.
[166:10.22]This is like a serving tray, whatever.
[166:11.60]Alright, I need spices and sweets.
[166:14.46]I need to go up here.
[166:20.64]Spices and sweets go up there.
[166:22.34]Coffee's gonna go up top.
[166:35.91]I'm freaking out.
[166:37.46]Why?
[166:41.24]Why?
[166:41.36]What do you mean?
[166:41.88]Why are you freaking out?
[166:55.21]Go go go to the I'm I'm fine.
[166:57.69]I don't have to go to the bathroom.
[166:58.57]I'm fine What are you talking about?
[167:17.95]Oh, that's helpful

[168:10.95]Poster.
[168:12.17]Trash bags.
[168:12.97]Idiot.
[168:18.79]This looks like a fucking kitty litter thing.
[168:20.73]I'm sorry.
[168:27.81]Freaking.
[168:28.35]Freaking.
[169:00.95]Where are the utensils?

[170:07.81]I don't need to pee.
[170:08.61]Stop.
[170:25.19]That can't fit up here?
[170:31.05]The rolling pin needs to be able to fit in here somewhere, right?
[170:33.57]Okay, there we go.
[171:04.81]Ah, utensils.
[171:37.92]I can move all that... I can move all that stuff.
[171:40.84]I can talk.
[171:42.34]Just slow down and say what you want to say.

[174:28.05]Oh.
[174:36.66]Just getting it out.
[174:37.60]Don't worry.
[174:38.06]It's going to be fine.
[174:40.34]Why is there a toaster in here?
[174:42.68]Um.
[174:45.70]Guys, where am I supposed to put this?
[175:22.25]Move!
[175:42.03]What is this even doing in here?
[175:54.42]I'm setting the table.
[175:58.14]You catch the game last night?
[176:01.75]What's your favorite subject in school?
[176:07.05]Do you like hot fudge sundaes?
[176:11.20]Somebody just said, did I catch the game last night?
[176:12.68]It freaked me out.
[176:21.17]That looks nice.
[176:23.17]I don't want to put this in here.
[176:30.12]Whatever.
[176:32.40]Okay.
[176:33.92]What remains?
[176:34.40]Oh, there's an upstairs.
[176:38.64]Oh, shit.
[176:39.41]Okay, so we do have a bathroom up here.
[176:41.93]I forgot.
[176:48.93]Why did I not finish this?
[177:13.86]Tissues?
[177:19.61]Eh.
[177:22.85]Okay.
[177:26.33]Am I almost done with the game?
[177:27.58]When does the game end?
[177:44.09]Oh, this is the last level?
[177:45.09]Oh shit, alright.
[177:49.52]Whoa, laundry.
[177:58.82]Okay.
[178:00.78]Okay.
[178:05.17]Okay.
[178:07.39]What's over here?
[178:26.21]What do I do with this towel?
[178:35.49]Whoa, there's a whole nother place to put stuff.
[178:39.28]Okay.
[178:41.46]Oops.
[179:19.80]Fuck.
[179:35.73]It's a bath mat.
[179:36.52]So what?
[179:37.16]Oh.
[179:40.62]Right.
[179:42.28]What is this bag of dog food?
[179:46.52]What is this?
[179:47.02]I don't know what it is.
[179:54.92]Actually, I really don't know.
[179:59.89]This is soil?
[180:02.41]Why would there be a bag of soil in the laundry room?
[180:06.22]It's a bag of dirt.
[180:09.34]Okay.
[180:36.67]This has got to come with me.
[180:40.63]Now the bathroom.
[180:42.13]It's got to come with me.
[180:47.77]Now what's the problem?
[180:48.63]Okay.
[181:02.06]It's very unhappy with this.
[181:05.18]Why?
[181:14.06]The coffee can be there.
[181:15.02]What's wrong with the coffee being up there?
[181:27.45]Bro, where else am I supposed to put this stuff?
[181:31.61]Bro.
[181:41.75]I think that's good.
[181:47.93]Apparently the scanner can't go here.
[181:49.83]So the scanner is going to the office.
[182:01.56]Problem solved?
[182:09.26]Problem solved?
[182:16.91]I have to fix this, don't I?
[182:30.40]I can't believe I did that.
[182:31.48]I need some protein or something.
[182:33.18]I need to eat a bag of peanuts.
[182:34.36]I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[182:37.74]I actually don't know what the heck I was doing.
[182:43.79]Okay.
[182:50.97]There's all kinds of problems.
[182:52.01]Just look at all these problems.
[182:53.45]Oh, fuck this plant.
[183:09.28]Alright, what am I missing here?
[183:11.38]This is in the wrong spot.
[183:12.40]Not anymore.
[183:13.02]Nope.
[183:13.60]Okay, that's in the wrong spot too.
[183:23.93]What am I gonna do about this?
[183:34.22]This bag doesn't fit!
[183:43.70]Yes!
[183:51.91]Towel and that's it.
[183:54.25]Let's go.
[183:57.45]Just put an extra towel somewhere.
[184:00.29]Just a fresh towel somewhere.
[184:05.92]What do I do with this?
[184:07.16]I don't... What do I do with this towel?
[184:11.84]I can't go in the baby room?
[184:22.08]Where is this supposed to go?
[184:27.03]Thanks, I appreciate the help when you say, up my butt.
[184:30.99]Thank you.
[184:32.21]Thanks.
[184:32.63]But I'm looking for a practical answer.
[184:35.39]Where is this supposed to go?
[184:39.69]Under the sink?
[184:47.76]How am I supposed to put this under the sink?
[184:54.40]Oh, I don't know, dude, maybe like up your butt?
[184:56.44]Maybe, oh, try up your ass.
[184:58.04]Oh, okay.
[185:00.92]It doesn't, this is an extra towel.
[185:02.90]I don't need this.
[185:06.00]This is an extra towel.
[185:07.86]I don't need this extra towel.
[185:21.39]Dude, this can't go anywhere.
[185:43.53]Now where does this piece of shit go?
[185:45.24]I just...
[186:29.20]This dude is cracked.
[186:35.41]Oh no, sorry, I'm gonna go.
[186:37.37]And they all do it for me.
[186:46.29]That was a lot.
[186:53.82]Take another bong rip?
[186:55.46]Nah, I'm good.
[186:56.82]I'm good.
[187:02.25]I think I'm good.
[187:07.17]I like this a lot.
[187:07.85]This is really fun.
[187:09.97]There's one thing I would change in this game, and that's to be able to be allowed to have stuff in the wrong place.
[187:19.21]It's the only complaint I have.
[187:22.63]It's a very solid, fun game, though.
[187:24.17]I thought it was good.
[187:24.76]I thought it was great.
[187:29.00]There's a setting where you can do that?
[187:30.44]Oh.
[187:30.92]Cool.
[187:32.64]That was a good time.
[187:38.91]The moving truck pulls up, there's a knock on the door.
[187:44.21]Now all your stuff is here, in boxes on the floor.
[187:49.62]You open up a box, there is so much to do.
[187:55.10]I open up my heart, this is now a home for two.
[188:08.26]Three games finished in one day.
[188:10.22]You can't count Freddy fish.
[188:11.92]That doesn't work.
[188:13.32]I do look kind of pale, don't I?
[188:39.05]It's because of the lighting here.
[188:40.31]And the auto-balance.
[188:42.42]I kind of look a little blurry.
[188:47.80]I just moved a bit over here to look at it.
[189:00.16]That was a lot of fun.
[189:02.32]That's a good place to end it.
[189:04.37]We're at six and a half hours about.
[189:07.54]Freddy Fish was fun.
[189:09.10]This game was fun.
[189:10.92]Gonna hang out with you.
[189:12.72]Yeah, have a good time.
[189:13.96]I had a great time.
[189:15.91]Yes, have a good time.
[189:17.05]Yes, I have a good time.
[189:19.29]I had a great time.
[189:36.73]Alright, next stream, next time you're gonna see me will be... Let's close this out.
[189:40.60]Play this out here.
[189:41.28]The next time you're gonna see me will be... On Wednesday.
[189:45.16]See you guys on Wednesday.
[189:48.12]Around the same time, between 2 and 2.30ish.
[189:51.09]I say 2, I know, but it really means 2.20.
[189:57.43]You cut the tape with my Stanley knife and...
[190:07.65]Great, I'll see you Thursday or Friday.
[190:09.03]Nope, it's going to be Wednesday.
[190:11.83]I've got a lot of stuff to do this weekend.
[190:19.19]There are many, many things that my brain is going to be spread out into five or six places.
[190:25.08]So I'm going to have to take the time this weekend to situate them all.
[190:34.39]Yeah, see?
[190:34.73]Wednesday, 2 o'clock.
[190:35.79]I don't know what I'm... I have no idea what we're gonna play.
[190:40.31]It'll be something cool, though.
[190:42.37]I hope.
[190:47.52]Alright, guys.
[190:49.06]Let's run the... Let's get the credits going.
[190:53.22]This music's gonna stay on.
[190:54.56]That's fine.
[191:07.53]What is the... Oh, never mind.
[191:12.23]I enjoyed the music.
[191:13.17]No, the game was great.
[191:15.86]That's really chill.
[191:19.98]It was a good chill time.
[191:24.58]What should I do on Wednesday, though?
[191:26.38]That's a real good question.
[191:36.31]Cruelty Squad?
[191:37.61]I don't know.
[191:38.27]I feel like playing ULTRAKILL drained me of two straight weeks of video game playing.
[191:46.19]I can do DreadX.
[191:53.74]Don't you feel like you want to have DreadX before a weekend, though?
[191:58.46]And which one should I play?
[191:59.72]Because there's four or five different compilations.
[192:02.04]Which one's a good one?
[192:03.54]Just start at the beginning?
[192:09.80]Vampire Survivor.
[192:16.36]We'll figure it out.
[192:24.39]They're all good.
[192:25.33]Each could be its own stream.
[192:26.49]Really?
[192:28.83]Okay, I'll look into that.
[192:29.65]Maybe we'll do that on Wednesday.
[192:30.45]Maybe we'll play the first one.
[192:32.81]Unless we can get some more ideas.
[192:35.69]I can go look at the recommended, too.
[192:44.05]Alright, guys.
[192:45.41]Good night.
[192:46.03]Goodbye.
[192:46.64]Take care of yourselves.
[192:47.46]Thanks for watching.
[192:49.32]Call your mother.
[192:53.58]Have a great night.
[192:54.13]We'll see you again soon.
[192:57.53]Take care.
[193:16.50]you
[193:51.38]you
