[00:09.33]Lakeside.
[00:11.77]One of the only places where you get a guaranteed... Okay.
[00:18.89]So as I was saying, Lakeside, you get a guaranteed couple of snipers that just stand up here.
[00:27.44]So the question is, can I kill this guy again?
[00:34.77]Oh, not this time.
[00:35.83]He dodged.
[00:36.97]He dodged.
[00:38.03]Oh, shit.
[00:39.09]Oh, God.
[00:40.49]Where is he?
[00:41.01]He's right here.
[00:42.51]Come on.
[00:43.13]Come and get me.
[00:43.63]I have a free Uber.
[00:45.99]Somebody help me.
[00:48.00]Help me.
[00:49.00]I won't kill you.
[00:49.88]Oh, Jesus.
[00:51.92]Just get out of here.
[00:52.82]Get out of here while you still can.
[00:58.51]Thing is just gonna have to come down to... Forget it.
[01:02.38]Bait him.
[01:03.22]Here comes the bait.
[01:03.94]You wanna see how you bait?
[01:05.84]I'll show you how you bait.
[01:07.78]That's how you do a bait!
[01:09.60]Didn't even kill him.
[01:10.44]Didn't even die.
[01:11.08]He didn't even die.
[01:11.72]That's fine.
[01:12.36]That's great.
[01:12.72]I'm gonna burn to death now.
[01:14.04]What a wonderful world.
[01:15.26]What a wonderful world.
[01:16.62]I ain't got no beef with you.
[01:24.85]Hey, get out of my face.
[01:25.61]I ain't got no beef with you.
[01:28.15]I ain't got no beef with you either.
[01:30.37]My beef is with this sniper.
[01:32.95]He's freaking out.
[01:34.65]Can he shoot me from here?
[01:35.35]I don't think he can.
[01:36.15]Holy god, there's another one!
[01:37.27]There's two of them!
[01:39.03]There's two of them!
[01:42.71]Oh, goddammit!
[01:44.61]That should've killed him!
[01:49.26]The goal in Barn Blitz is up here.
[01:53.48]If I just stand right here, some son of a bitch is gonna come up here.
[01:58.36]Like this.
[01:58.98]And walk right into it.
[02:00.60]They always move at the last second.
[02:03.22]I'm like two mil- What?
[02:10.52]I went out the window?
[02:11.78]I was like hanging out the window by my underpants.
[02:16.11]You were like, somebody was like hanging me, like shaking coins out of my underwear.
[02:26.65]You don't even know?
[02:27.21]You don't even know?
[02:29.35]Wish that was longer.
[02:30.15]Oh, fuck!
[02:35.83]What?
[02:38.46]Are you kidding me right now?
[02:40.64]What's this guy doing?
[02:42.08]What?
[02:45.48]Are you really not gonna, like, come after me?
[02:49.93]He's not even paying any attention to what I'm doing.
[02:53.25]I'm gonna get this sniper!
[02:55.53]My god, how is this still happening right now?
[02:58.91]How am I able to do this and how am I missing?
[03:02.31]Please, just... This is the one.
[03:07.59]This is the... YES!
[03:14.44]Free ubercharge!
[03:15.90]Oh god.
[03:18.12]I'm gonna have to use it immediately.
[03:21.14]Do it!
[03:22.34]No, I don't have to do it yet.
[03:23.66]It's just a spy.
[03:25.74]Do it!
[03:26.72]What the f- Just going in with the saw.
[03:28.78]If I can get a taunt kill, I can get one.
[03:31.59]We're gonna go for, uh... We're gonna go for some fucking saw kills here.
[03:38.05]What are you- I got someone?
[03:42.11]Who did I get?
[03:42.83]I got the spy?
[03:43.72]How come I didn't hit him initially?
[03:46.10]He was just, like, stabbing me in the face.
[03:52.92]Alright, I guess I'll take it.
[03:58.06]Perfect timing.
[04:01.28]If I play my cards right... I'm real, I'm real, don't worry.
[04:07.04]Looks like this... they're all backing up.
[04:12.72]There's a spy over here?
[04:14.30]Oh, I just heard... Shoot him!
[04:17.12]Shoot him!
[04:20.09]Okay, I had to pull up.
[04:21.65]I had to.
[04:21.93]Where are you going?
[04:22.77]Where are you going, dude?
[04:24.78]Get out of here!
[04:26.18]You fucking... Here he comes again.
[04:30.32]Here he comes again.
[04:32.44]Shit!
[04:33.87]He hasn't shot me yet.
[04:38.43]What's happening?
[04:40.53]What is happening?
[04:48.76]I was hoping he was gonna walk right into that.
[04:51.14]A victim!
[04:57.05]A victim!
[05:01.41]Okay, well I had a chance there.
[05:04.90]I had a chance, and it was all taken from me.
[05:07.66]Are you serious?
[05:09.46]What the f- What a psycho!
[05:12.87]Dude, that guy just came over here to try to hit- What a absolute psycho.
[05:17.53]Alright, well... It's good to know.
[05:19.81]That was like Looney Tunes.
[05:21.87]That guy just kind of came out of nowhere.
[05:24.90]Oh, well, shit.
[05:26.66]I'm okay.
[05:29.12]I'm going for your medic friend!
[05:30.44]That's the one who's the one real danger!
[05:35.12]Shit!
[05:36.74]Gonna have to use this.
[05:38.91]Do I have anybody around?
[05:39.63]Is there anybody around?
[05:42.15]That's a spy.
[05:44.95]Alright, well, no.
[05:47.17]There's nobody around here.
[05:49.33]Pop it, don't drop it.
[05:50.53]Pop it, don't drop it!
[05:51.19]I remember seeing that.
[05:53.53]PSA.
[05:57.79]You know what?
[06:00.37]Pop it!
[06:03.82]I got you.
[06:04.44]I got you all.
[06:04.98]Don't worry.
[06:05.57]Everyone's alright.
[06:08.25]Now give me another free uber!
[06:14.75]Time for the mission to commence.
[06:17.64]If I get spotted, I'm going to be very upset.
[06:23.35]Not so much.
[06:24.25]Wait till he zooms in again, because he's obviously... And of course, he just stares at me and turns around and shoots me.
[06:30.96]I should have went in.
[06:32.30]I should have went in when I had the goddamn chance.
[06:34.24]I should have went in when I had the goddamn chance!
