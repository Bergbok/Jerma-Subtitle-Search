[00:07.01]Hey, welcome.
[00:08.39]Thank you.
[00:09.17]Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10.35]Welcome to the new show.
[00:12.27]Black, settle down.
[00:13.01]Settle down.
[00:13.39]Okay, thank you very much.
[00:15.11]Welcome to the new series here on Jerma985.
[00:18.36]It is a game show titled, What's the TF2 Sound?
[00:22.24]So we're going to go ahead and invite our first ever contestant, STAR_.
[00:26.40]Welcome to the show, Star.
[00:27.88]Hello, how are you doing today?
[00:29.74]I'm doing great.
[00:30.12]I came all the way from Kentucky to be here on this.
[00:32.15]Alright, yeah, okay, so here we go.
[00:34.39]You're gonna have to guess the TF2 sound.
[00:36.31]Can you get it right?
[00:37.33]Here we go.
[00:38.01]That's the scout, that's the scout.
[00:42.99]What is the TF2 sound?
[00:45.84]That was just you.
[00:47.94]That wasn't the TF2.
[00:48.52]I thought you were gonna get like an actual sound clip.
[00:50.92]No, no, no.
[00:51.36]Of a sound.
[00:52.10]What was it?
[00:54.44]I don't know.
[00:55.52]What is that sound?
[00:56.75]You don't know what that is?
[00:58.27]No, I don't know what that is.
[00:59.73]Yeah, cut it.
[01:00.79]Cut the music.
[01:01.57]No.
[01:02.17]It was the mini-sensory.
[01:03.37]I don't know how you didn't get that.
[01:04.71]That's not what it sounds like.
[01:06.35]Now, you see, I disagree, but not gonna start an argument about this.
[01:11.08]That's the sound it makes.
[01:11.96]That's not the sound it makes.
[01:12.92]That is the sound it makes.
[01:13.60]It's rhythmic.
[01:14.38]It doesn't go... No, that is the sound.
[01:16.44]I'm gonna prove it to you right now.
[01:17.48]You wanna hear?
[01:18.02]You wanna hear?
[01:18.74]Are you listening?
[01:19.88]You guys should check it out right here.
[01:21.13]You wanna hear the sound it makes?
[01:22.01]No.
[01:23.53]This is the sound it made.
[01:24.43]Well, it's setup time, so you're gonna have to just wait a second.
[01:27.13]Okay.
[01:28.85]Watch out for the spy.
[01:29.60]Watch out for that spy!
[01:31.68]I tried to warn him through voice communication and he didn't hear me.
[01:35.12]Alright, where are you?
[01:36.12]I need to find you.
[01:36.74]I'm fucking dead!
[01:38.48]Oh, you died?
[01:40.22]You just watched him backstab.
[01:40.92]Well, you're about to get proven.
[01:42.30]Are you ready to get proved wrong?
[01:44.00]I'm ready to get proven.
[01:45.36]Okay, you're about to get proven.
[01:47.21]Here we go.
[01:48.29]You're not with me.
[01:49.07]Oh, you're the healer.
[01:49.63]Okay.
[01:50.35]I'm the healer.
[01:51.87]Take a listen.
[01:52.35]It's going to start here in a second.
[01:54.33]No, it's not.
[01:54.63]He blew it up.
[01:55.99]He's ubered.
[01:56.67]Run.
[01:58.16]Just run away.
[02:00.43]Okay, now is the moment of truth.
[02:02.33]Now it's time for you to hear the mini-sensory sound.
[02:05.21]Ladies and gentlemen, here we go!
[02:06.45]I don't believe.
[02:07.17]Fucking... I think you're delaying.
[02:10.93]I think you're doing this on purpose.
[02:12.01]No, I'm just going back to the medicine cabinet to get some aspirin.
[02:16.86]And let's go.
[02:17.70]Okay, I'm following you everywhere.
[02:20.06]I'm the healer.
[02:23.29]Time to hear the sound once and for all.
[02:29.58]I feel like this video is going to be 90% built up.
[02:32.30]Can we please make this thing?
[02:34.83]I want to just... Alright, kill me.
[02:39.03]Kill me.
[02:40.91]Okay, I'm going to put it down right there.
[02:42.51]Eventually, like, ladies and gentlemen, here we go.
[02:45.03]Time to hear the sound.
[02:45.95]Here we go eventually.
[02:47.01]We're going to hear that this is not the sound.
[02:48.90]Listen to the sentry right now.
[02:50.22]It's just going beep, beep.
[02:50.94]It's not shooting.
[02:52.18]It beeps like one.
[02:52.84]It doesn't go beep, beep, beep.
[02:53.86]It beeps.
[02:54.96]No, it goes beep, beep, beep.
[02:57.72]See, you're going to hear it double because of this guy.
[02:59.44]I'm going to hear a lot of it.
[03:00.44]He's going to Rancho Relaxo all over this.
[03:04.26]See, right now, listen carefully.
[03:06.23]No, now no one's going to come over here.
[03:08.98]Just wait.
[03:10.56]Somebody will come through the door.
[03:13.88]Going up the right side.
[03:15.64]I'm currently moving up the right side.
[03:17.54]Here, here, here.
[03:18.34]Just put it in this corner.
[03:19.18]Just put it in that corner, and someone will come out eventually.
[03:21.31]No, not that fucking corner.
[03:22.83]Why?
[03:23.57]I shot it over here.
[03:24.49]They're going to come out the door and just see it.
[03:25.85]Which corner?
[03:26.25]This corner?
[03:26.57]This corner.
[03:27.37]Like, sneak it.
[03:28.59]Alright, it's very sneaky.
[03:29.91]That's a very sneaky... Okay, now we just need to wait and hear the sound.
[03:32.83]Yeah, and we're going to see who's right and who's wrong.
[03:35.76]I think it goes...
[03:37.54]And you don't think so?
[03:39.08]I don't think so.
[03:40.49]This scout.
[03:41.49]This scout's gonna get de-de-de-de-deed.
[03:43.41]But not.
[03:44.01]That doesn't... I would love for him to walk out here.
[03:47.67]Will you just walk out here?
[03:50.63]He's gonna do this forever.
[03:54.13]He's gone.
[03:55.89]Oh, see?
[03:56.59]Listen.
[03:57.17]Oh, no.
[03:57.90]Did you hear that?
[03:59.46]You heard it, didn't you?
[04:02.27]No, no, no, no, no!
[04:03.37]It never did that before!
[04:04.39]Why is it doing that now?
[04:05.29]It's doing it!
[04:06.20]It's not doing it!
[04:07.40]You can't have my bananas!
[04:08.54]I just bought them!
[04:09.36]Those are my bananas!
[04:10.30]I'm taking them from you!
[04:11.00]I'm gonna have to wash my dishes again!
[04:16.42]Look at all these, look at all these dee-dee-dees I'm getting.
[04:20.38]You wanna, oh, you think it's gonna work?
[04:22.16]What is going on in here?
[04:23.76]It's me.
[04:24.42]I'm the medic.
[04:25.48]What?
[04:26.72]I'm the medic.
[04:27.28]Oh, you're this medic.
[04:31.04]Things in your brain just don't add up right away, do they?
[04:33.94]No, I... Hey, I'm this medic.
[04:38.46]Oh, you're this medic.
[04:39.42]Alright, well, for the second part of this video... That's a satisfy!
[04:46.75]For the second part of this video, I need you to be on my team.
[04:50.13]Okay.
[04:50.71]This is part two.
[04:52.41]This is part two of sounds.
[04:55.31]What?
[04:55.87]How do they make them?
[04:58.86]So for part two, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[05:03.88]What sound is that in the game TF2?
[05:06.78]That is no sound in TF2.
[05:08.12]You just screamed for like 12 seconds.
[05:10.91]Oh, that's not a sound.
[05:11.75]That's you.
[05:12.43]Great joke.
[05:12.97]I think I already fucking made it.
[05:14.25]No, that sound is in TF2.
[05:15.91]Oh, really?
[05:16.55]What was that sound?
[05:17.89]You have to guess.
[05:18.61]You have to figure it out.
[05:19.59]So you're telling me there is a sound in TF2?
[05:21.43]Mine at least was close.
[05:23.74]Yours was nothing.
[05:25.92]Mine was close enough.
[05:26.92]You were just like... No, that sound is part of... Of this map?
[05:33.06]The ecosystem.
[05:34.82]Is it the cart?
[05:37.83]Did I win?
[05:38.77]No, it's a weapon.
[05:41.27]We were only doing weapons.
[05:42.85]Like you did the weapon slinger.
[05:44.69]Do it again for me.
[05:49.63]It's different every time.
[05:54.41]That is not a Saturn TF2.
[05:56.21]I'm sorry.
[05:57.19]Yeah, no, it's a gun.
[06:00.19]Rocket launcher.
[06:01.31]No.
[06:02.37]Grenade launcher.
[06:03.29]No.
[06:04.09]Cold.
[06:06.48]Scattergun.
[06:07.78]No.
[06:08.20]No, no, no, no, no.
[06:09.28]You're not thinking the right way.
[06:10.38]Katana.
[06:11.56]No.
[06:12.70]What the fuck is it, then?
[06:13.65]It's, um, somewhat, I mean, it doesn't have to kill people.
[06:16.91]Huntsman, the Huntsman, the Huntsman.
[06:20.27]No.
[06:20.33]Uh, lock and load.
[06:21.43]No, this is... Crit's Creek, Crit's Creek.
[06:22.95]Yes, yes!
[06:23.87]Yes!
[06:24.27]God, it was obvious.
[06:25.83]Dang, how did I not get that?
[06:27.37]I know, it doesn't hurt people, that was the clue.
[06:29.48]I know, the hurting side is good, the hurting side is good, the hurting side is good, the healing side is good.
[06:38.42]Wow, that, uh...
[06:40.41]That sounds absolutely nothing like what you did at all.
[06:44.61]No, that's exactly what it is.
[06:45.85]Like the first initial activation, it starts off like that and it goes down.
[06:51.06]Okay, well we got that mystery solved.
[06:54.74]I'm gonna go ahead and play some Demoknight for the remainder of the video.
[06:58.05]And then end the video.
