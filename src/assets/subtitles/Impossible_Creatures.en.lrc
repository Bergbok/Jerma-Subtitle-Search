[00:08.72]I don't know.
[00:09.12]I don't know if I like that.
[00:14.42]No, there's something wrong here.
[00:16.52]There's something wrong.
[00:18.35]It's the elephant.
[00:18.97]I know elephant.
[00:19.95]It's got to be something else.
[00:21.61]Giraffe.
[00:23.09]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[00:24.87]That is the perfect animal.
[00:27.67]Hey.
[00:28.51]What are you doing over here?
[00:32.93]Click on him and look at his name.
[00:34.47]What is that?
[00:35.57]Look at its name.
[00:39.33]Do you remember in real life?
[00:41.83]XD!
[00:43.71]What is that?
[00:44.33]Is that a hippopotamus gorilla?
[00:46.67]Yeah!
[00:47.55]No!
[00:48.13]Get out of here!
[00:49.10]This is our turf!
[00:50.18]This is a giraffe skunk turf!
[00:52.72]Get the fuck out of here, you fucking- I don't think you could've hurt him.
[00:55.58]Can I not kill this?
[00:58.46]Get out of here!
[00:59.04]He's too awesome!
[01:00.34]Come help me, long guy!
[01:01.88]I need help from long guy!
[01:03.90]What do you mean, long guy?
[01:12.42]Is that a dachshund?
[01:14.66]Ready, boss.
[01:15.94]You're the boss.
[01:17.18]No building this up.
[01:18.06]Somebody's cheating.
[01:20.20]Building's done.
[01:20.96]Oh, really?
[01:23.36]Thanks for the heads up.
[01:24.36]I don't know.
[01:26.18]No, I don't... Stop.
[01:31.44]Just stay here.
[01:33.00]Just stay here.
[01:36.56]Can I do anything?
[01:37.34]Can I do any funny moves?
[01:39.56]Where are my funny moves?
[01:43.56]One of these times you're going to spawn there and it's going to kill you.
[01:46.20]Got him.
[01:48.84]That's not fair.
[01:49.98]No, it's really not.
[01:53.98]And what the hell were you two doing?
[01:57.10]You're supposed to be guarding the perimeter.
[02:00.26]Kill him.
[02:01.84]No, kill him.
[02:03.48]Kill the disappearing shark shithead.
[02:05.34]He's dead.
[02:05.86]No, you got him.
[02:07.26]I did not kill him.
[02:09.06]He is very much alive.
[02:12.37]See?
[02:12.71]I told you he was alive.
[02:13.59]Okay, now he's dead.
[02:18.64]How am I supposed to win?
[02:21.08]I can't... Stop!
[02:24.58]Let them have a fight.
[02:26.80]You're not supposed to just let them die.
[02:29.22]That was all the fight I had.
[02:30.86]The Quillers are under attack.
[02:32.98]Come on.
[02:33.74]What is that thing?
[02:44.03]What?
[02:46.11]You don't like... You don't appreciate the meta.
[02:50.95]What meta?
[02:53.09]The overlord scouting meta.
[02:56.21]I don't think I understand this joke.
[02:59.35]That's a whale bee.
[03:01.29]What is it?
[03:01.75]The overlord?
[03:03.63]No, he's like a zerg.
[03:04.91]You send your overlord out to scout first.
[03:07.07]I didn't play StarCraft.
[03:08.37]I don't play StarCraft.
[03:11.74]I have not played Starcraft enough to know what that is.
[03:15.03]I think everyone who has ever played a video game, at the very least, knows what a fucking Zerg rush is.
[03:24.93]Yeah, well, that's not... Here comes my Zerglings.
[03:30.11]I wasn't even ready.
[03:31.03]Come on!
[03:38.63]Okay.
[03:39.79]Alright, okay, alright.
[03:41.75]Your overarching theme, I get it.
[03:43.71]You're doing a StarCraft thing with your turtle bugs.
[03:46.89]That's really great.
[03:49.03]It is really great.
[03:51.92]Get the fuck out of here.
[03:53.64]Get this thing, get your Overlord and fucking stuff it up your ass.
[03:57.20]He says he's coming for himself.
[03:59.26]We have plenty of units.
[04:01.38]We have the strangest animal the whole time.
[04:06.16]Those people!
[04:06.96]I love how my... They're not even attacking.
[04:10.30]Attack them!
[04:10.84]Kill them!
[04:12.10]Kill the people!
[04:13.62]Why did you... This is so shit!
[04:16.41]Get them!
[04:16.67]The quillers are under attack!
[04:17.67]Get them!
[04:19.93]The quillers are under attack!
[04:21.15]We're not gonna win!
[04:22.37]We're not gonna win!
[04:23.35]Steal their coal!
[04:24.51]Steal the coal!
[04:25.21]Get out of here!
[04:26.72]Get the coal!
[04:27.40]Come on, Snake!
[04:28.12]Spit it out!
[04:28.82]Spit it up, Snake!
[04:32.30]Start mining!
[04:33.28]Start mining!
[04:34.20]Everyone mine it!
[04:35.19]I would have figured these guys would be dead way long ago.
[04:40.87]They are getting eaten by giant crocodile bears.
[04:45.05]He's getting out with the coal.
[04:46.27]Where are all the sound effects?
[04:48.78]Get him!
[04:49.10]Kick his ass!
[04:51.18]We're taking this into the base.
[04:59.72]We are taking this shit into the base after you kill them, Darren.
[05:03.50]Go for it, Darren.
[05:05.36]The fights in this are so anticlimactic.
[05:08.25]Kill them all, Darren.
[05:10.39]That's right.
[05:10.93]Who is Darren?
[05:12.33]Very good, Darren.
[05:14.03]Very good job, Darren.
[05:16.21]You thought you could mess with the Darrens.
[05:17.79]You thought for one second you could fuck with the Darrens.
[05:19.78]I didn't think I could.
[05:22.34]Come on, Darren.
[05:24.14]You've got this, Darren.
[05:26.20]He thinks he can beat us with his beaver praying mantises.
[05:28.73]Does he know who you are?
[05:30.37]You're fucking Darren!
[05:32.87]No!
[05:35.05]Darren!
[05:39.59]For centuries.
[05:40.39]I don't know how to start this.
[05:42.78]How do you start this?
[05:45.88]I don't know.
[05:46.72]What are we fighting for?
[05:49.26]I would like to speak with your leader.
[05:52.05]Yes.
[05:53.73]The other leader.
[05:55.01]The other one.
[05:55.59]We have plenty of leaders.
[05:57.65]When one goes down, the other will take its place.
[06:00.47]I need at least one.
[06:02.05]There's another one right here.
[06:03.26]There's another leader.
[06:05.06]Would you like to see a new one?
[06:06.32]This is also a leader.
[06:09.60]Yeah, see, one of your guys we caught the other day, he was on our sand.
[06:15.52]And we agreed that was ours.
[06:16.44]I don't believe that.
[06:17.28]We had a treaty 2,000 years ago, your people and our people, that this bridge shall never be crossed unless for diplomatic reasons.
[06:25.89]We're crossing it right now.
[06:27.17]We caught one of your...
[06:29.14]What are you gonna do about it?
[06:30.76]What are you gonna do about it?
[06:32.56]That's an act of war!
[06:33.88]You back up while that is an act of war!
[06:35.70]It's an act of war!
[06:37.26]Transform!
[06:38.60]What?
[06:39.76]Wait, they're not... Why did you say nuclear transform?
[06:56.83]I don't know.
