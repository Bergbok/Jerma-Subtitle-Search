[00:03.85]All right, if I was an animal, what animal do you think I would be?
[00:08.39]Serious answers only.
[00:09.83]A rooster.
[00:13.21]A rat.
[00:14.67]A rat, a rat, a rat.
[00:17.43]You'd be a rat.
[00:18.47]Jeremy, you're a rat.
[00:21.23]I think I'd be a wolf.
[00:23.63]I think so too.
[00:29.34]I would be a wolf-lion hybrid mix.
[00:33.00]King of the jungle, but still social and with it and ferocious.
