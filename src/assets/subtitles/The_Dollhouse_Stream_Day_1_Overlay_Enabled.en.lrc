[01:55.79]We'll be right back.
[05:56.06]you
[09:31.45]I don't want anybody to see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[11:30.42]Don't you got time?
[13:14.77]so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[20:07.43]I can't breathe without these.
[21:31.83]I feel like we're getting ticked off here.
[21:33.45]I wouldn't say like when I was a student,
[22:11.92]Just a little too big.
[25:56.37]TikTok video.
[25:56.99]I was just doing it.
[25:57.90]I was just going.
[29:02.71]Oh!
[29:05.51]Oh, a mailbox!
[29:14.60]Yay!
[29:21.82]Whose house is this?
[29:22.76]This is my house?
[29:25.14]Let me give it a check.
[29:29.26]Anybody in there?
[29:29.94]Hello?
[29:31.11]Can you hear me?
[29:33.22]Why don't we give it one more try?
[29:37.96]Come on, open the door, I'm here.
[29:40.50]That was a voice crack in the first 10 seconds.
[29:44.96]All right.
[29:47.87]Nice.
[29:49.03]It's not bad.
[29:52.73]It's not bad at all.
[29:55.17]I mean, I kind of feel like a dickhead just by the way that I'm dressed, but you know, whatever.
[29:59.69]Refrigerator.
[30:03.52]Oh, refrigerator.
[30:07.49]Stove.
[30:08.51]Oh yes, I love stoves.
[30:11.27]Sink.
[30:12.03]Oh my God.
[30:21.81]I can't believe it.
[30:23.84]How many rooms do I have?
[30:24.74]Just one or do I have two?
[30:27.50]How many do I have?
[30:28.16]Oh, this is a nice bathroom.
[30:34.19]Spacious.
[30:35.67]Comfortable.
[30:37.57]I could utilize this.
[30:39.69]Toilet.
[30:42.11]Shower.
[30:44.89]And sink.
[30:45.19]Does this sink work too?
[30:46.27]What do you think?
[30:46.97]Should we try it?
[30:49.05]It does.
[30:51.38]A workable sink.
[30:54.48]I feel pretty good.
[30:56.76]But that could change really quickly.
[30:58.68]I'll look into this one here.
[31:00.50]Take care of me.
[31:01.95]Don't fuck around.
[31:03.25]You've got three streams to do this.
[31:06.51]Good luck.
[31:09.41]I'm just going to go.
[31:09.93]I'm going to go in the kitchen.
[31:10.89]Whatever.
[31:12.27]Why not?
[31:18.85]Is there anything even in the fridge?
[31:20.23]I see something I like in there.
[31:31.58]Wash my hands really quickly.
[31:34.85]Welcome to the dollhouse, though.
[31:37.41]Got a few things you might need to take care of.
[31:38.85]Got a few needs.
[31:40.65]I just saw somebody said starve him.
[31:45.21]I want that person timed out for an hour.
[31:52.88]So what I want to do is I...
[32:05.68]What I want to do is I want to use the bathroom.
[32:25.21]How am I using my hands?
[32:29.25]You know what, I don't even need to hold it.
[32:31.95]Why don't we give the toilet a flush, why don't we?
[32:45.00]That was a long one, I think.
[32:46.12]That took a little while.
[32:50.86]Hey, Jerry!
[32:55.36]Gotta get this thing out of the way.
[32:57.10]Do I have to wear all this shit the whole time, by the way?
[33:00.57]Do I have to wear this the whole time?
[33:02.93]I'm like on fire right now.
[33:05.74]This helmet, this helmet's like making me sweat.
[33:15.40]I like the shower.
[33:19.59]It's beautiful.
[33:20.75]It's really what it is.
[33:21.93]And I'm taking this off because I don't want it on anymore.
[33:25.09]I just don't, it's too hot.
[33:27.53]That's just the way it is.
[33:30.53]So what I'm looking for for you to do is I'm looking for you to take care of me.
[33:35.98]Take good care of me.
[33:36.90]I want to sleep well eight hours a night.
[33:41.52]I feel like I'm presenting like an infomercial.
[33:46.64]Hey, does your toilet do this?
[33:47.58]Does your toilet do this?
[33:48.46]Well, good, because that means it's working.
[33:55.68]What do I want to do?
[33:59.79]This is what happens when you're just in this world.
[34:04.19]What happens is... It's got a really bad migraine that's making... I don't want to go that way, though.
[34:12.25]I want to go back in the bathroom.
[34:13.23]What am I doing?
[34:13.61]I want to take a jog.
[34:14.83]For what?
[34:16.09]I don't jog.
[34:18.98]Okay, I'm going to... I didn't even lock the door.
[34:22.84]I didn't even lock the door.
[34:23.64]I got to lock the door.
[34:24.36]Somebody lock the door?
[34:25.18]Why am I doing this?
[34:26.62]I don't want to fucking go here.
[34:45.17]There are cars on this road.
[34:49.49]There are cars on the street.
[34:50.73]All right, when can I stop doing this?
[34:56.37]I'm starting to stink.
[34:57.69]All right, I'm going back in.
[35:09.59]I'm going back in.
[35:15.29]I'm going back in.
[35:15.83]I'm not wearing that helmet either.
[35:18.49]Oh, wait.
[35:19.85]Anybody in here?
[35:20.51]Hold on.
[35:29.26]I'm going to have to get an electrician to look at that.
[35:34.74]Oh, I smell awful.
[35:38.64]I kind of feel awful, too.
[35:44.95]Let me wash my hands.
[35:45.57]That was a fucking big run.
[35:51.70]All right.
[35:52.98]We can just chill.
[35:53.58]I don't have to do anything.
[35:54.72]I don't have to go anywhere.
[36:00.65]God, this is awful.
[36:08.69]Can I... Can I go... No.
[36:12.50]Why can I not...
[36:15.26]I can't, I don't know, that one doesn't do anything.
[36:17.08]Why?
[36:23.38]Why am I going outside?
[36:44.96]Why am I going outside, what are you doing?
[36:47.64]Hey, no, I don't, wait a fucking second, all right?
[36:50.95]I'm not going out there again.
[36:56.39]I don't wanna go out, this is a beautiful day out here.
[36:59.49]Wow, look at those birds.
[37:07.11]This is pretty nice, I like this.
[37:13.28]Look at these flowers.
[37:16.90]They're beautiful.
[37:21.48]I smell so bad.
[37:24.71]Take care of me for God's sake.
[37:30.57]How about another one?
[37:37.62]Going back in.
[37:38.72]That was beautiful though.
[37:45.28]I'm sweating through my clothes.
[37:46.84]And I mean that in real life and in fake life.
[37:54.04]So it makes sense that I would be like this.
[38:01.10]You'll have a series of choices.
[38:02.52]I hope you choose wisely.
[38:08.68]And when you have these choices to make, I really hope that
[38:14.99]I feel like shit.
[38:16.77]I hope that when you make these choices that you do them in a way that it can succeed all of us.
[38:22.76]I think I need to fucking lie down.
[38:30.40]What was I saying?
[38:31.91]I wanted to go for a jog or something.
[38:35.67]I feel awful.
[38:38.85]I'm getting like a bad headache and shit.
[38:40.39]I'm like really tired.
[38:43.91]I really just kind of want to like... That's probably... Over here?
[38:50.10]I think that's a good spot I sure want.
[44:32.65]Oh, that was fucking hell.
[44:33.83]I feel like somebody just punched me in the face like three times.
[44:38.47]I feel like I just, I had this weird vision, this weird dream, this like sleep paralysis demons just surrounding me.
[44:47.89]Ow, my knees.
[45:05.27]What's that?
[45:08.07]What is this?
[45:08.45]Is this a, what, what is this, a stool?
[45:16.00]I don't like that there.
[45:17.00]That's not what that should be.
[45:18.28]I don't like that.
[45:20.58]I don't like it.
[45:21.92]But I'll tell you what I do like.
[45:22.86]I like sassy sunglasses.
[45:29.35]How am I supposed to go to the bathroom in this?
[45:42.78]I am disgusting.
[45:44.26]Someone please help me.
[45:46.40]Can I please just put me into a bathing scenario?
[45:50.12]I am here washing my hands desperately.
[45:54.00]Please let me bathe.
[45:56.43]Put me into a scenario where I can clean my body.
[46:07.83]Trash.
[46:08.97]Sink.
[46:12.92]I need to clean myself.
[46:14.46]You can't just let me fucking be like this.
[46:16.24]Give me a break.
[46:37.05]I hope that nobody comes over because this is absolutely revolting.
[46:41.84]What if my mother shows up, huh?
[46:43.68]What if my mother decides to come in here?
[46:47.00]You know what she'd say?
[46:48.90]She'd be disgusted.
[46:49.76]She would put her face in the air, and she would run away.
[46:54.46]What if my mother shows up?
[46:56.82]What if my mother shows up?
[46:58.50]All right?
[47:05.28]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:06.36]Not with the stool there.
[47:07.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[47:08.58]OK, OK.
[47:09.34]I guess I have to go to the bathroom now.
[47:15.20]Now I'm peeing on the stool.
[47:17.46]We gotta move the stool.
[47:18.70]I don't wanna pee on the stool.
[47:22.50]That's good.
[47:23.38]Yeah, I just did.
[47:25.52]Okay, that's good.
[47:33.05]Very good, very good, very good, very good.
[47:35.99]But I can't even use that.
[47:36.77]That's supposed to be a place to sit down.
[47:38.89]That's a place for me to sit and relax.
[47:45.18]Can I take a shower?
[47:47.26]Can I just take one?
[47:48.54]I want to.
[47:50.26]I want to right now.
[47:52.16]I would love to take a shower right at this moment.
[47:58.45]I want to take a shower.
[47:59.01]Put me in the shower.
[48:02.59]I'm waiting.
[48:04.67]I'm waiting to go in the shower.
[48:08.53]I don't want to go to work.
[48:09.53]I want to go in the shower.
[48:10.79]I can't go in front of people like this.
[48:26.49]I'm going outside.
[48:37.23]Shut up, dog!
[48:40.32]I like mailboxes.
[48:41.08]I love them.
[48:45.88]What?
[48:46.12]Oh, thank God.
[48:47.20]Am I going where I think you are?
[48:49.54]Am I going where I think you're going?
[48:51.26]Please tell me you're going this way.
[48:52.30]Are you going this way?
[48:53.38]Please say yes.
[48:54.72]Don't make me, like, take a shit in the toilet for, like, a second.
[48:56.72]I haven't even taken a shit yet, but whatever, you know what I'm saying?
[48:58.83]Thank God.
[48:59.19]Am I going there?
[48:59.71]I am going there.
[49:00.21]Thank God.
[49:02.21]Oh, my God, they picked it.
[49:02.99]Thank goodness.
[49:05.05]Let me just take these off.
[49:13.64]Thank you.
[49:14.56]Thank you.
[49:16.06]Oh, this feels so much better.
[49:19.16]Hey, look at me.
[49:22.28]Look at me.
[49:35.07]I don't do that.
[49:38.95]I don't do that.
[49:43.70]Well, maybe you do, right?
[49:44.94]Maybe I do sometimes.
[49:49.42]Sometimes you just gotta let the water hit you right in the face.
[49:53.33]Right in the face, there it is.
[49:59.99]That feels so much better.
[50:01.73]Oh my goodness.
[50:06.14]Ta-da!
[50:10.08]Hey, I'm not naked anymore.
[50:14.67]Alright, we're good.
[50:15.23]We're good.
[50:15.55]We're fine.
[50:15.99]We're fine.
[50:17.44]Oh, I feel so much better.
[50:18.58]I'm fucking hungry, though.
[50:21.72]If I'm not gonna go to work and I'm not gonna make money, then you gotta make me food.
[50:25.44]Stupid.
[50:25.72]I shouldn't have called you stupid.
[50:26.98]That was mean.
[50:27.38]I was supposed to sit over here.
[50:36.18]Put the hat on.
[50:41.12]I can't...
[50:43.64]You make... I want food.
[50:45.22]And I want to... I don't need to go to the fucking bathroom again.
[50:51.62]Something's going on with this toilet.
[50:54.55]Something's going on with this toilet.
[50:56.77]Okay, alright.
[50:57.47]The toilet's like pissing at me.
[50:59.31]The toilet is effectively peeing at me.
[51:01.49]And, um... I didn't even sit on it.
[51:04.89]It's just broken.
[51:06.61]The toilet's broken.
[51:09.26]What the fuck?
[51:10.18]I didn't even... I didn't even have a chance to sit on it.
[51:13.39]Oh my god.
[51:14.27]I don't know how to turn it off.
[51:17.75]What the fuck?
[51:18.43]I didn't even sit on it.
[51:24.80]Okay, I think it's clean.
[51:26.46]I think it's good.
[51:27.64]No, it's not.
[51:28.42]No, it's not.
[51:29.16]It's fucking still pissing out.
[51:32.58]I've used this toilet twice.
[51:33.94]I don't know what to do about that.
[51:36.84]Alright, I'm going over here.
[51:40.74]It's just like peeing all over me.
[51:44.80]I was gonna use the bathroom.
[51:48.76]All right, all right, I'll put the clothes on.
[51:51.22]Okay, hey, let's put them on.
[51:53.19]There we go.
[51:54.29]Can I just take this stupid thing out?
[51:55.77]I hate this thing.
[52:00.23]What am I gonna do about that?
[52:01.35]I can't go to the bathroom.
[52:02.37]I need to eat.
[52:04.45]Make some decisions.
[52:08.63]How am I gonna call for a parent when I don't have a phone?
[52:13.11]I'm gonna have to like scream out the window.
[52:18.15]I need a repairman, but I don't have a telephone.
[52:31.24]If anybody in this neighborhood is a repairman or a repairwoman, I could really use your help right now.
[52:35.86]Fuck you, dog.
[52:51.57]I don't have a telephone, but if you could show up, that would be fantastic.
[52:57.98]I'm starving.
[53:01.32]I haven't eaten in two days.
[53:02.46]I haven't eaten in two days.
[53:04.98]What the, who the zoo's at?
[53:07.54]I'm feeling like faint.
[53:08.56]I haven't eaten in two days.
[53:10.06]I feel fucking terrible.
[53:11.26]Who's at the door?
[53:13.28]Hello?
[53:15.27]Got a clogged shitter?
[53:19.18]Yeah, I guess.
[53:20.24]Not really.
[53:20.68]I haven't taken a shit in it since I've moved here.
[53:24.48]So that's, I guess, technically.
[53:28.15]How much is this going to cost?
[53:29.29]Depends on how bad it is.
[53:32.57]I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[53:33.47]By the way, I'm sorry I look like this.
[53:36.09]It was chosen for me.
[53:36.85]The toilet's in here, by the way.
[53:39.53]I don't know what's going on.
[53:40.33]It just started leaking.
[53:43.17]I'm really happy, in fact, that you live in the neighborhood.
[53:45.22]In fact, you heard me and you were ready to work and you had your work clothes on and you had a bucket with you.
[53:48.40]That's really, really helpful.
[53:51.02]Yeah, it's just going.
[53:51.72]I don't know what to do.
[53:59.35]Yeah, it's just spraying water.
[54:03.79]Yes, it is.
[54:04.47]I haven't used it, so I don't know what to do about it.
[54:07.35]I have no idea what you want, what I'm supposed to do.
[54:14.09]Does this cost money?
[54:14.81]How much money does this cost?
[54:18.35]There's so much water over here.
[54:21.03]What am I doing?
[54:27.97]Look over there, don't look.
[54:32.35]Don't look over here.
[54:33.57]Don't look over here.
[54:34.47]In fact, get out of the room.
[54:35.37]That's gonna cost you extra.
[54:49.68]Is the toilet fixed?
[55:08.73]I don't know.
[55:12.42]Don't, I didn't want to go in the shower.
[55:21.52]Okay, I'm fine, I'm back, I'm back ready to go.
[55:31.95]You motherfuckers, I swear to God.
[55:34.11]I'm fucking starving too.
[55:41.87]Where did they go?
[55:43.61]Where is she?
[55:59.10]I didn't... I'm fucking starving right now and I need food.
[56:10.57]And I need it now.
[56:14.75]Make it happen.
[56:17.21]Thank God.
[56:22.09]Finally, some mac and cheese.
[56:30.14]Mac and cheese.
[56:31.68]Thank God.
[56:34.78]Finally get to eat some damn food.
[56:43.13]I guess I'm talking... Ow, my finger!
[56:47.70]Just get some... Okay.
[57:18.00]I'm not having a good time right now.
[57:28.38]I didn't want to fucking, I wanted to pay the person.
[57:33.74]I mean, for the love of God, I just want to fucking have something to eat.
[57:43.21]Just some food and shit.
[57:44.33]I feel fucking terrible.
[58:13.46]Just fucking not having a good time.
[58:21.94]This is good though.
[58:28.54]I need something to do.
[58:30.08]Give me something to do.
[58:43.90]Get this hat off, too.
[58:45.08]It's constricting.
[58:46.39]I don't like it.
[58:52.81]I don't care.
[58:53.47]I'm not happy.
[58:59.58]I can't do that.
[59:00.80]I'm so stressed.
[59:03.94]I'm not do...
[59:11.61]No, I can't.
[59:12.90]I...
[63:00.06]What's on me?
[63:02.16]What's on me?
[63:09.98]What is that?
[63:12.48]Did somebody break into my fucking apartment?
[63:15.14]Break into my house?
[63:18.28]Okay, um...
[63:24.97]I don't hate it.
[63:26.69]I think it's kind of ugly.
[63:27.93]And it kind of smells.
[63:30.81]Okay.
[63:37.60]It's kind of comfy.
[63:48.67]I like it, but I... But I don't like it.
[63:59.67]I don't want to sit on a dirty bed in a dirty fucking place, okay?
[64:05.79]I am, nothing is, I'm not having a good time at all.
[64:09.17]At all.
[64:09.53]And I blame you guys.
[64:11.01]I blame, it's your fault that I don't feel good because you have so many opportunities to make me feel better.
[64:17.12]And you put, there's a mattress and like a stool that I piss on.
[64:19.92]That's fantastic.
[64:20.72]Whatever.
[64:22.22]I don't even fucking care.
[64:28.43]I don't fucking care at all, actually.
[64:30.55]And you guys fucked it up.
[64:35.32]Does the toilet even work?
[64:36.72]I don't even know.
[64:37.52]I didn't want to fucking do that stupid shit that you guys did.
[64:40.86]Okay, well, it works.
[64:55.34]And it works so good, it works twice.
[65:52.57]I don't have anything to make them... Fuck off.
[65:59.27]I don't care.
[66:02.46]There, I made the bed for you.
[66:09.13]Is there any fucking way for me to live?
[66:25.45]Who are they?
[66:27.89]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[66:29.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[66:30.82]Off the bed.

[67:11.17]It's okay.
[67:11.63]It's a little bit funny.
[67:15.20]It's kind of funny.
[67:19.70]This is actually kind of cool.

[67:38.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[67:46.76]No, no, no, no.

[68:34.07]Why am I holding the balloon still?
[68:36.87]I don't want this.
[68:37.66]Do I have to go to work?
[68:46.04]I don't have to go to work, right?
[68:47.72]How much money do I have left?

[77:41.54]It's hot up here.
[77:46.41]Alright, I need to actual, like, wipe these down.
[77:48.91]There's fucking peanut butter everywhere.
[77:53.44]I'm exhausted and I'm starving.
[77:56.30]You're gonna have to pick one because I don't know what to do.
[78:02.54]Let me just wipe the handles.
[78:04.15]He, like, got his hands on the peanut butter and it was just disgusting.
[78:08.41]Ugh.
[78:15.75]I'm so tired.
[78:16.89]Give me something to fucking play with or something, please.
[78:19.95]For the love of God.
[78:23.43]It is filthy in this bathroom.
[78:24.91]This water, this dirt.
[78:32.95]No, I'm not.
[78:34.83]No, I'm not going to do that.
[78:36.59]I'm not going to make a peanut.
[78:37.49]I'm not making peanut butter and jelly.
[78:40.09]No, I'm not.
[78:42.17]He put his hand in that.
[78:42.99]I'm not going to eat out of that.
[78:46.27]He actually put his hands inside the peanut butter and like he ate with his fingers and put his hands back in.
[78:50.42]So I have to eat it.
[78:52.66]They want me to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[79:00.82]Let me at least get the peanut butter off the handles.
[79:05.79]It's a disaster.
[79:11.71]All right, I gotta take the trash out too eventually.
[79:13.49]I got a lot of shit, hold on.
[79:14.69]Look at all this.
[79:17.89]This is ridiculous.
[79:20.67]I'm gonna fucking pass out too.
[79:27.44]I don't want any of this.
[79:31.42]Drinking my beer.
[79:37.00]Can I, I need to...
[79:51.84]That's his finger, that's his thumb.
[79:55.44]That's a literal thumbprint in here.
[80:05.37]I literally, a sitcom audience just laughed over here.
[80:08.15]I just heard it.
[80:08.57]That was revolting.
[80:10.87]God damn clowns.
[80:17.18]I'm so tired.
[80:19.92]You have no idea.
[80:22.17]I need a utensil to do this with at least.
[80:28.37]Oh shit, plastic, plastic, plastic.
[80:30.97]Plastic, I don't wanna cook this.
[80:34.75]Let's get this out of the way.
[80:36.23]Why would you cook a peanut butter sandwich?
[80:41.50]I'm not cooking.
[80:43.42]I'm not cooking anything.
[80:48.18]Who does like a peanut butter sandwich on the stove?
[80:57.32]I need this bad, but let's go around the fingerprint.
[81:00.89]Oh, I can see it.
[81:08.35]I'm just gonna have a little.
[81:09.43]Okay.
[81:16.84]I need to, I gotta put this somewhere where I can actually use it.
[81:21.16]Here.
[81:22.20]What a sad peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but there's no jelly, and a clown put his hand in it.
[81:28.63]This is good, like that.
[81:31.49]It's really hot in my house.
[81:32.47]I don't even have air conditioning.
[81:39.68]I know there's milk in the fridge, but the clown drank that too, directly out of the jug.
[81:44.84]He ruined everything.
[81:45.66]He ruined my entire fridge.
[81:52.71]That motherfucker did what?
[82:10.82]This is good.
[82:13.08]I'm fucking tired.
[82:19.77]That's bringing me back to life.
[82:22.13]Thank you.
[82:26.31]I have to pee bad, though.
[82:28.27]Or, I don't know, I have to do one or the other.
[82:31.47]Ugh, that feels much better.
[82:43.72]I need to pee.
[82:45.09]I need to use the bathroom.
[82:46.79]I didn't even sit down.
[82:48.87]Why is there already something in here?
[83:20.36]We're not doing that.
[83:34.28]I'll pee in it.
[83:35.44]I'll pee in it, but I'm not doing that again.
[83:38.96]I'll pee in it.
[83:40.30]Okay, I'm not gonna do the other thing.
[83:46.14]That feels better.
[83:59.29]Okay.
[84:06.89]I'm so tired.
[84:10.13]I'm so fucking tired.
[84:26.88]you
[86:24.55]We'll be right back.
[90:19.86]Uh... What?
[90:28.20]Oh, damn.
[90:29.46]What?
[90:29.68]Um... Ah!
[90:30.47]Ah!
[90:50.82]God.
[90:58.05]Nothing in here.
[91:00.25]I keep waking up to new shit in my house.
[91:05.15]Apparently not today.
[91:16.20]Everything here that was supposed to be here,
[91:22.58]Those weirdos were here, but... Great.
[91:24.68]That's where that goes.
[91:53.68]Right out here.
[92:06.07]Oh, popcorn!
[92:06.87]I love popcorn maker!
[92:08.85]What?
[92:10.47]Oh, this is awesome!
[92:12.71]Popcorn!
[92:13.89]It's a popcorn maker!
[92:15.45]It creates popcorn out of thin air!
[92:17.15]Alright, hold on.
[92:21.77]Uh...
[92:24.23]Get the mail too.
[92:30.63]Why is there food in here?
[92:31.57]Somebody left something in here.
[92:36.82]OK.
[92:43.41]This is from the neighbors, I guess.
[92:44.87]Well, thank you.
[92:46.41]Thank you, whoever you are.
[92:47.39]I really appreciate it.
[92:49.35]Thanks for coming and fixing the toilet, too.
[92:51.51]I know you can hear me, because everyone has their windows open and everyone's ready for work.
[92:55.68]At all times, apparently.
[93:00.92]How much money do I have?
[93:04.67]I need money.
[93:06.23]What are you guys buying?
[93:07.47]You're buying all this shit.
[93:08.23]What am I going to do with a popcorn maker?
[93:10.57]I mean, I like it.
[93:11.27]I love it.
[93:11.71]I mean, I love, I love Popcorn Maker.
[93:14.81]But, um, I mean, what am I going to do with this?
[93:30.08]Did you buy me popcorn kernels, too?
[93:31.98]Because, I mean, this is cool.
[93:42.10]Let me plug it in.
[93:45.00]This is a disaster in here.
[93:46.44]It's a fucking mess.
[93:50.02]I can't do anything.
[93:51.96]I don't even have popcorn kernels.
[93:54.87]I'll put it up here.
[93:57.93]Maybe I'll use it later.
[94:02.99]I can't even go anywhere.
[94:03.95]I don't like this living situation at all.
[94:08.55]I don't like the bed being here.
[94:10.41]I don't like the... You know what?
[94:15.79]This is disgusting.
[94:16.69]I don't know where this is from.
[94:18.21]I don't know where this has been.
[94:21.05]But I don't want it in my house.
[94:24.13]I'm sorry.
[94:24.55]I'm just going to be honest.
[94:37.19]Time for work.
[94:38.33]I'm coming.
[94:38.85]Hold on a second.
[94:39.49]I got to test my doorbell.
[94:51.30]Okay, all right, all right, all right, I'm gonna be late for work.
[94:53.35]Okay, go, okay, okay, okay.
[95:21.61]Tough day at work.
[95:23.17]See you at the party on Saturday.
[95:38.09]Did I really want to invite everybody in that car?
[95:42.27]Probably not.
[95:54.01]Why are they still here?
[95:55.88]Did I leave my phone in the car?
[96:10.04]What if I did though?
[96:11.08]What if I never could make a phone call for the rest of my life?
[96:18.70]What if I can't make a phone call for the rest of my entire life?
[96:22.10]Like, I have to go to the fucking phone store.
[96:24.22]I gotta get a new phone.
[96:25.38]I have to, like, call and redo everybody's numbers and stuff.
[96:28.83]I don't want to do that.
[96:39.80]Give me this.
[96:40.74]You won't fucking... Meow.
[96:47.24]Meow.
[96:48.64]Meow.
[96:53.70]No!
[97:27.78]Can you guys find a lock for the door?
[97:37.27]I'm not answering the door.
[97:56.49]I'm literally not, I just, I don't have to answer the door.
[98:02.57]I'm not answering the door.
[98:04.35]They can stay out there.
[98:15.92]I'm not gonna let them into the house.
[98:17.62]Cause like I saw, I don't want another finger in my peanut butter.
[98:32.71]I saw it happen last time.
[98:34.19]Fuck it.
[98:42.72]Oh, come on!
[98:44.27]Oh, shit!
[98:46.37]It's really... Oh, God damn it.
[98:51.51]Hold on, wait a minute.
[99:03.41]You can't come in here.
[99:04.67]You can't come in here.
[99:05.91]You can't come in here.
[99:07.70]Uh-uh.
[99:10.30]I don't know how they got in.
[99:11.92]Why are they allowed in the house?
[99:15.36]Why are they allowed in the house?
[99:22.69]All right, obviously, obviously this is dangerous.
[99:27.09]What happened?
[99:29.29]What happened?
[99:35.71]What happened?
[99:36.31]Somebody's touching my face.
[99:42.08]Somebody's on me.
[99:42.56]Somebody's on me.
[99:44.80]I'm not going to eat a piece of pizza with whipped cream on it, okay?
[99:47.56]Get the fuck out of here.
[99:49.24]I'm not going to eat that.
[99:50.20]I'm not going to eat it.
[99:55.09]I'm not going to eat this.
[99:55.85]I don't know what this is.
[99:56.75]I don't know what this is.
[99:57.87]This is like a kid's school project.
[100:00.79]No, get away from me.
[100:05.89]I don't even know what they're doing here.
[100:07.35]I don't even know why they're even in here.
[100:16.81]Why do I have permanent clowns?
[100:18.11]Take this back.
[100:18.73]Okay, I don't know what you have, but.
[100:23.28]I can't see.
[100:24.88]I can't see, I need help with something, please.
[100:37.91]No, no, no, I'm not taking a shower, I'm hiding!
[100:59.82]Are they gone?
[101:20.75]Oh no, one gave it away.
[102:35.92]I gotta find the fuse box!
[102:37.40]I gotta find the fuse box!
[102:40.84]Oh, my face!
[102:43.20]The fuse box is back here!
[102:46.64]Close the door!
[102:47.84]Close the door!
[102:50.98]It's over here somewhere.
[102:52.78]I think I found it.
[102:54.94]God damn it!
[102:58.64]Where is it?
[103:00.90]It's back here in this little cubbyhole.
[103:04.39]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, my fingers.
[103:07.35]Oh, shit, that hurt.
[103:09.93]Oh, my hand.
[103:10.73]All right.
[103:13.89]How do I get back into the house?
[103:14.93]Ow, my hands.
[103:24.36]All right, out, out, out.
[103:26.24]Power's back on, get out.
[103:27.14]Out, out of the house.
[103:28.34]Out of the house, out of the house.
[103:30.18]Out of the house now.
[103:31.10]Out of the house right now.
[103:33.73]Now, don't come back.
[103:35.47]And you're not invited to the party.
[103:37.25]Oh, God.
[103:42.17]Don't come back.
[103:50.83]Goddamn clowns.
[103:56.73]I burnt the shit out of my hand going back there, by the way.
[104:00.94]I'm so tired.
[104:08.36]I'm exhausted, I can't, I'm not gonna, you wanna play outside, great.
[104:27.18]It is soaking wet out here.
[104:32.94]Disgusting.
[104:40.25]I'm playing outside, apparently.
[104:44.90]Why do I think that's playing?
[104:56.08]Christmas time.
[105:00.56]I love Christmas.
[105:05.75]You have to choose sleep sometimes guys because this is how you fuck me up for the rest of the week.
[107:16.50]Thank you.
[109:16.49]you
[111:36.49]What the fuck?
[111:43.57]I gotta pee.
[111:44.85]Ugh.
[112:10.68]This is ridiculous.
[112:12.96]I've only lived here for like fucking four days.
[112:15.28]It's like I threw a party.
[112:21.41]Ay-yi-yi.
[112:23.73]Oh, hey, ha-ha, make sure the doorbell works.
[112:26.23]I'm not even going to do it.
[112:34.65]Ay-yi-yi.
[112:35.05]So what happened?
[112:41.19]at the popcorn machine.
[112:46.74]What's new?
[112:57.00]Oh, phone, telephone.
[113:00.09]Finally, I can make telephone calls.
[113:01.93]I don't have to scream out my window.
[113:08.28]I messed up something over here.
[113:09.42]I ripped up some tile.
[113:16.14]How does it work?
[113:23.97]Hello?
[113:24.33]I don't know how... How does a phone... Hello, yes, this is Control speaking.
[113:36.17]Hello, yes, this is Control speaking.
[113:37.45]How is the spaceship doing?
[113:42.00]I don't know how to use that.
[113:46.06]Wait, call.
[113:50.90]Oh, I get a piss.
[113:51.46]Let's see how Mom's doing.

[114:25.58]Been here for four or five days or so.
[114:28.96]It's been great.
[114:29.84]It's really good to hear your voice, too.
[114:32.37]I'm sorry I kinda like disappeared.
[114:33.73]Yeah, I have had no way to communicate with me at all.

[115:09.59]I've got to go.
[115:10.51]I've got to get off the phone, and yes, yes, I've got to go.
[115:15.15]I've got to go.
[115:15.75]I've got to get off the phone.
[115:17.09]I've got to get off the phone.
[115:18.03]Mom, I'm going to go pee with you on the phone, and I'm going to hang up after.
[115:21.64]Goodbye, Mom.
[115:22.16]It's good to see you.
[115:31.42]I'm not going to piss or shit on the phone with my mother.
[115:35.14]I'm sorry.
[115:38.14]You picked it too late.
[115:40.88]There you are.
[115:41.36]It's not gonna happen.
[115:47.24]I feel pretty good.
[115:49.66]That was a good call though.
[115:51.32]It's good to talk to my mom.
[116:01.49]It feels good now.
[116:03.19]Life is good.
[116:04.35]I feel good.
[116:05.75]I feel like I look good.
[116:09.49]Too much stuff though.
[116:15.33]I wish I could just get rid of this stuff.
[116:17.47]Do you see what happened over here?
[116:21.05]There's a slice of pizza here with whipped cream on it.
[116:23.05]I don't want that.
[116:24.33]I want to get rid of it.
[116:24.93]I don't want that.
[116:27.43]I'm in my house anymore.
[116:34.26]Time to go to work.
[116:35.81]Let's go.
[116:37.16]Be there in a sec.
[116:48.96]Time to make some money.
[119:49.32]you
[121:21.00]Bye-bye.
[121:23.80]Thank you for the ride.
[121:26.10]Again.
[121:59.76]Tired, hungry, all the above.
[122:02.41]All of the above.
[122:11.71]It's ridiculous.
[122:13.66]That was a rough day at work too, but I made some money, you know?
[122:18.00]And that's the good thing.
[122:31.63]That feels better.
[122:33.57]Oh my goodness.
[122:34.67]I feel like a thousand dollars more than I did earlier.
[123:01.06]I'll have some of this.
[123:01.72]If I can even get it in.
[123:36.17]That doesn't do anything.
[123:41.55]You know what?
[123:44.66]I'm going to have some cereal.
[123:54.94]Cereal sounds good to me.
[124:07.61]Am I peeing?
[124:08.87]Am I peeing?
[124:09.87]What happened?
[124:13.07]Why was I just peeing?
[124:19.89]Oh, it was a sizzle.
[124:21.23]I was like, why am I pissing?
[124:25.40]All right.
[124:32.68]Wait, shower, I'm not done.
[124:44.76]I can't take a shower with the food.
[124:48.53]Alright, maybe I can.
[124:51.99]Oh, it's getting all in there.
[125:00.82]It's getting all soggy.
[125:01.92]It's all getting soggy.
[125:05.80]That was like Peter Griffin.
[125:08.24]I just realized that.
[125:10.32]Oh, it's getting soggy.
[125:15.09]But killing two birds with one stone though, this is good.
[125:55.84]Starting to feel better, life's coming back.
[125:58.62]Life is coming back into me.
[126:11.46]I'm just tired and unhappy.
[126:43.75]What?
[126:45.01]I got a piece of mail!
[126:55.31]What's it say?
[127:01.46]Five hundred dollars!
[127:03.58]An inheritance!
[127:05.68]Seven hundred and fifty dollars!
[127:07.04]I misread it in my glasses!
[127:09.46]Seven hundred and fifty dollars from dear Uncle Ted!
[127:14.15]No way, what an inheritance.
[127:16.81]What did he leave me?
[127:18.57]His weight set?
[127:25.02]Was that rain?
[127:27.28]That's a huge deal.
[127:35.05]All right, that's money.
[127:39.01]That's big money.
[127:46.15]I was sad before, but that's another $750.
[127:48.77]How much money do I have in my bank now?
[127:51.69]How much money do I got?
[127:52.41]Do I have more than 500 bucks?
[127:55.04]Like 1,200 bucks?
[127:55.36]Holy shit.
[127:57.58]This floor is filthy.
[128:32.82]Hello?
[128:36.35]Ma?
[128:36.79]Yeah.
[128:40.11]Yeah, I heard about Uncle Ted.
[128:43.29]Yeah.
[128:45.63]Yeah, I know.
[128:46.67]He sent me something.
[128:47.64]Did he send you anything?
[128:52.22]No.
[128:53.42]Yeah, I got $750 in an envelope.
[128:55.64]It was a check, but still.
[128:57.48]How you doing?
[128:59.40]Yeah.
[129:01.33]Yeah, no, I mean, that's really nice of him, but... What did he give you?
[129:08.29]You got 10 grand.
[129:12.93]That's awesome.
[129:14.29]Hell yeah.
[129:16.19]That's awesome.
[129:16.62]Well, that's sad, but, you know, that's... Yeah, I got money.
[129:21.16]He sent... I don't know how... When did he send it?
[129:24.62]Why would he send it?
[129:27.88]Oh, it's inheritance.
[129:28.62]That's right, that's right, that's right.
[129:29.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[129:31.04]So it was split up across the whole family.
[129:35.34]Oh, there's a house too.
[129:36.44]Wow, that's very interesting.
[129:37.84]Yeah.
[129:39.72]Yeah, I know, that's sad.
[129:40.94]Well, I mean, he left some stuff for everybody.
[129:43.24]That's really cool.
[129:44.02]That's really nice of him.
[129:46.20]Yeah.
[129:48.42]Yeah, I'll talk to you soon.
[129:51.58]Yeah.
[129:52.92]All right, Ma.
[129:55.07]All right, Ma.
[129:56.27]Yeah.
[129:57.21]Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[129:58.95]Yeah, love you too.
[130:01.74]That's right.
[130:03.74]That's right.
[130:04.14]That's what you say.
[130:04.60]You love you to your mother.
[130:05.94]You haven't talked to your mother lately?
[130:07.46]Call her and say, I love you.
[130:10.04]Do it.
[130:10.30]Do it tonight.
[130:11.51]Don't wait.
[130:13.21]Mother's important.
[130:13.89]She's very important.
[130:29.80]Right in the bed, finally.
[130:31.36]The first night I've actually been able to sleep in the bed.
[130:34.60]It's been a very long... That was the mattress.
[130:38.93]That was the mattress.
[130:39.69]That wasn't me.
[130:41.09]That was the mattress.
[130:41.97]It's like the fart stream.
[130:44.45]It's the fart stream.
[130:46.16]I gotta get comfy.
[130:46.88]Hold on.
[132:55.62]We'll be right back.
[137:22.44]That was not bad for the first time ever being able to sleep on this bed.
[137:28.82]I feel a little groggy, but it's okay.
[137:41.81]I didn't have one of those weird sleep paralysis dreams.
[137:45.35]Not last night.
[137:55.10]Huh.
[137:59.71]Filthy.
[138:01.39]I hate it in here.
[138:02.69]I can't even be in here.
[138:03.49]I literally cannot even be in this room.
[138:07.29]All right, hold on.
[138:21.60]What?
[138:21.80]I don't know.
[138:22.57]What happened?
[138:32.76]Can I at least get rid of some of this stuff?
[138:36.54]It's ridiculous.
[138:37.62]It's... That's just... No.
[138:42.14]I'm cleaning up a little.
[138:44.35]Just to be able to walk around again.
[139:03.31]What?
[139:04.85]What?
[139:14.80]It looks very broken from what I can tell.
[139:19.40]Hold on.
[139:23.81]Can I even go to work?
[139:24.71]I don't think I can even go to work if you wanted me to.
[139:38.05]I'm going out the window.
[139:40.28]I'm going out the window.
[139:41.90]You didn't close the window.
[139:44.10]I'm going out the window.
[139:46.76]I'm going out.
[139:57.71]I feel like that scene in fucking Ace Ventura.
[140:01.45]When he's coming out the rhino's ass.
[140:15.39]Hey, yay, bed.
[140:22.29]Bed.
[140:34.42]I love what you've done with the bed.
[140:38.93]Why does everything have to go in the yard?
[140:40.47]You have to put everything in the yard?
[140:44.89]Any mail today?
[140:45.93]No.
[140:50.57]Well, at least I can't.
[140:51.55]I'm not climbing back in, so send me to fucking work.
[140:55.41]OK?
[140:55.57]I'm not going to climb back in the window.
[140:57.90]I'm going to work.
[141:04.82]I'm not climbing back in.
[141:09.76]I could sit on it though, I could hang out on it.
[141:15.87]This side just sunk.
[141:17.43]Oh, that's what this is for!
[141:19.15]That's what fell out.
[141:20.47]That was the very loud noise that I heard.
[141:22.51]I heard an incredibly loud sound.
[141:31.58]This bed is fucked.
[141:33.32]I'd rather lie on the dirty one.
[141:35.22]I'll be honest.
[141:39.24]What, I got mail?
[141:42.25]What's the mail?
[141:53.88]I got $100 from Dolls R Us for the thing I left at the shop that I had a consignment.
[142:05.73]Well, cool.
[142:08.57]All right, more free money.
[142:10.43]I'll take free money.
[142:15.39]Should I go to work too?
[142:16.17]Send me to work.
[142:16.83]I literally got nothing else for me to do out here.
[142:24.80]I have to use the bathroom too.
[142:36.94]Feeding, feeding you money so you can make the right decision.
[142:44.26]I don't think I could even put this together if I wanted to.
[142:56.10]That's the last part of the day.
[142:57.72]If I hear another fire, I'm coming over there, I swear to God.
[143:02.71]Oh, it's just the bottom, all right, now I can, no, this is a fucking, this is a train wreck under here.
[143:07.12]But wait, this is an air mattress.
[143:12.00]This is not even a bed.
[143:14.46]Look at what happened under here.
[143:16.89]What happened under here, look at this.
[143:19.31]Do you see what I have to deal with right now?
[143:24.37]This is, I can't put this together.
[143:29.17]I'm gonna sleep on it like that.
[143:36.17]It's just absolutely destroyed.
[143:38.27]I don't know if you guys can hear it, but it was seriously, it was like an explosion back here.
[143:43.25]It just fell apart in their hands.
[143:47.71]Work?
[143:49.43]Oh, is it time for work?
[143:52.20]I see the car pulling up.
[143:54.62]Hey, pick up this guy.
[143:56.96]You know what I'm saying?
[144:02.70]Car.
[144:02.82]Are they on the road?
[144:03.46]I don't even hear them.
[144:07.65]Oh, there you are.
[144:09.73]Don't worry about what you see over here, by the way.
[144:12.02]Just don't drive far enough to see my driveway.
[144:15.26]Let's go.
[144:40.40]Yeah.
[144:44.50]That was a dick move.
[144:47.80]No, that was a dick move, what you did.
[144:53.28]Not everybody thinks that's funny, so I just wanted to let you know.
[144:56.31]But we'll see you at the party on Saturday.
[144:57.59]He's still going to go.
[145:05.39]I can't.
[145:07.97]I got to pee bad.
[145:13.02]You know what's funny?
[145:13.60]Even if I wanted to move this, I wouldn't be able to.
[145:16.84]I'm not going through the window.
[145:18.26]That hurt.
[145:21.46]Even if I wanted to move this, it would be hard for one person.
[145:37.19]I don't know what to do.
[145:38.21]I need to get in there.
[145:41.82]What do I do?
[145:42.78]Help!
[145:48.97]Hey, excuse me!
[145:50.41]Excuse me!
[145:51.19]Help me!
[145:51.69]Excuse me!
[145:52.35]Help!
[145:53.31]Right?
[146:29.06]There's a water fountain over there that I hear.
[146:31.24]I heard a water fountain.
[146:35.74]Hey, I wonder if it flushes.
[146:47.79]That's so stupid.
[146:50.19]I'm not having a good time though.
[146:53.08]Give me something to play with.
[146:53.98]It's so much fun.
[147:01.81]I would go back in there, but I just don't want to go in the window.
[147:07.95]Will this fit over me?
[147:09.69]No, I don't think so.
[147:11.77]I could go like this.
[147:13.99]No.
[147:15.52]This is kind of fun what I'm doing, but not really.
[147:24.34]It could... This actually could be a hat, but I'm not... Somebody just said it could be a toilet seat.
[147:28.12]It's not going to be that.
[147:30.22]I'm not going to use this as a toilet seat.
[147:32.90]Oh, this is kind of a funny hat.
[147:34.12]This is a funny hat.
[147:35.12]I like it.
[147:35.58]This is a funny hat.
[147:43.35]I can't even block the door.
[147:46.05]I could very easily just get in there.
[147:47.87]I could.
[147:49.55]But...
[147:54.06]make food I can't um but if I can eat these flowers edible I don't think I can even tight can I at least can I eat one of these what happens to my to my uh hunger level if I eat one of these hold on let me see
[148:25.92]Ow!
[148:27.90]It's like stung me.
[148:28.72]All right, what if I take like a bite?
[148:32.80]I'll take a big bite.
[148:44.39]It's not good.
[148:50.73]I can't go.
[148:51.45]All right, I'm climbing the window again.
[148:53.81]No, I don't want to climb in the window because then I won't get the comfortable bed.
[149:07.17]No, I don't want to get hurt.
[149:09.89]This is day one.
[149:14.34]Oh, shit.
[149:17.08]But these have been out here for like five days.
[149:20.74]Haven't these been out here for like at least five days, right?
[149:26.94]Can I actually eat these or is that going to be bad for like... What if I just pretend to?
[149:36.87]I don't know how long these actually have been here for.
[149:38.65]Now I'm at another bite.
[149:49.90]That was really good.
[149:53.96]I want to just like jump in.
[150:06.75]What?
[150:09.85]What are you doing?
[150:11.61]You want me to run?
[150:13.27]Run?
[150:14.17]Run away.
[150:17.70]Like now, you want me to run away?
[150:19.58]That's... Run down the street?
[154:30.35]Well, I can't get back inside.
[154:32.63]That's very obvious.
[154:35.47]This is a nice house.
[154:39.36]How am I gonna get back in here?
[154:41.04]Run away?
[154:41.44]I've been walking around the neighborhood for the last like six hours.
[154:43.56]You know how people have come out and just looked at me and been like, what the hell is this guy doing out here?
[154:50.44]Seems you have chosen to upgrade the house.
[154:55.25]And what does that mean?
[154:57.59]That means that that is the end of the tutorial.
[155:01.31]So, thank you for playing in our tutorial version of this game.
[155:05.16]Hopefully it worked out pretty well.
[155:06.90]I think it did.
[155:08.98]And in two days, that is where the real game starts.
[155:16.08]So, this was a ton of fun.
[155:19.54]Let me look at the right camera.
[155:20.80]Right here?
[155:21.16]There we are.
[155:22.12]I had a ton of fun.
[155:23.42]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[155:24.52]Special huge, huge, huge scam.
[155:29.59]Well, I want to say thanks to everybody watching.
[155:31.65]We have two more streams of this, and it's going to get even more wild.
[155:37.68]We're literally going to dial it even higher and higher every day.
[155:42.12]So I keep talking to the wrong cameras.
[155:43.68]I don't know what's wrong with me.
[155:45.26]We're going to dial it up every day.
[155:47.20]Every single day it's going to get more ridiculous.
[155:50.08]So we want to make sure that everything worked as intended before we got started.
[155:55.00]So I cannot actually get into this house, so I'm not going to even try.
[156:00.79]Trial version of Volgame unlocked.
[156:04.21]Special huge thank you to Twitch for partnering with us and to Coinbase.
[156:09.71]Without them, this would never have happened.
[156:11.79]And there is way more to see over the next two or three days.
[156:15.21]So what that means, you'll see in the next few days.
[156:18.59]But we got everything.
[156:19.87]What was that?
[156:23.52]You paid to end the stream.
[156:25.36]You paid to end the tutorial is what you did.
[156:29.44]But yeah, I'm really, really happy.
[156:31.72]I really think that everything worked out pretty well in this kind of tutorial version of the game.
[156:35.70]So I'm very, very excited.
[156:38.00]I hope you had fun.
[156:39.18]We got a lot of data.
[156:40.50]So we got a lot of things that we might have to work on and check out and see how they played out.
[156:44.24]But for the most part, I think it was pretty fun.
[156:48.13]So we'll see.
[156:50.61]So we'll see with the upgraded house in a couple of days.
[156:54.49]with even more wacky, wild stuff.
[156:59.49]Thank you, everybody.
[157:00.27]We'll see you in a couple days.
[157:01.23]Thanks for playing the tutorial.
[157:04.39]I can't go back in there.
[157:06.66]Huge shout out to Twitch.
[157:07.74]Huge shout out to Coinbase for letting us do this shit.
[157:11.26]Huge thanks.
[157:12.02]Without them, it's impossible.
[157:16.24]We'll see you in a couple days.
[159:21.65]Thank you.
