[00:33.59]Hello.
[00:33.77]How you doing?
[00:41.84]Doing pretty good.
[00:46.58]On time.
[00:48.82]It's funny that I can be four or five minutes late and still be considered on time.
[00:53.58]I appreciate that.
[00:55.10]Thanks for giving me the the extra leeway.
[01:01.86]Oh, it's 6.05.
[01:03.06]He's on time.
[01:05.04]Not really.
[01:06.42]But better.
[01:08.18]Better.
[01:11.28]Okay.
[01:14.50]So, hello.
[01:14.82]I'm going to play some Mercenaries today.
[01:18.72]Came out today.
[01:23.77]I remember playing this on the old Resident Evil 4.
[01:28.33]I got very addicted to this.
[01:32.65]Very long time ago.
[01:33.47]Dude, the Roblox stream was funny as fuck.
[01:38.07]I mean, we just had a good time.
[01:46.13]I appreciate that you think that though.
[01:48.19]It was a lot of fun.
[01:53.25]And that's all that matters at the end of the day.
[02:03.02]Do I know who Hunk is?
[02:04.14]I do.
[02:05.66]Don't spoil it.
[02:13.60]Oh, I forgot to tweet.
[02:21.79]There we go.
[02:22.27]You're gonna have to be a full-time Roblox streamer.
[02:35.61]I feel like Roblox is kind of a... I feel like that's a really easy way to be able to hit up other streamers and just go, hey, do you want to just do this for a few hours?
[02:45.90]Because one of the things that's actually kind of difficult streaming is there's so many people to reach out to or talk to or whatever.
[02:57.05]And it's like, oh, what about you?
[02:57.93]Do you want to do something?
[02:58.61]Maybe I'll do something with you.
[02:59.61]And it's like, oh, what do you want to do?
[03:01.77]And it's like, oh, fuck.
[03:03.45]What do we want to do?
[03:07.23]I think that's a very simple thing just to be like, let's go ride roller coasters and Roblox for an hour.
[03:14.18]It's just easy.
[03:14.76]It's just easy to like put that line out, right?
[03:21.58]Good title.
[03:28.02]Well, I didn't make it, so don't give me the credit.
[03:35.44]It's simple and fun.
[03:39.81]I mean, it is whatever you decide to make it, I guess.
[03:43.21]There's a lot of stuff on Roblox, from what I've been told.
[03:49.13]And, I don't know, a lot of it is probably not very good.
[03:52.78]There's probably a ton of really just... There's a lot of really, really good things.
[03:57.52]There's probably a lot of really bad things, too.
[03:59.48]I don't know anything about it.
[04:02.18]Why you hate her?
[04:04.71]I don't know.
[04:06.21]I'm just saying.
[04:07.87]I don't know.
[04:08.23]There could be a lot of things that aren't very good.
[04:11.58]Is that why people have opinions on it?
[04:13.58]I don't know.
[04:13.90]I don't know anything about it.
[04:18.30]Nice centrist take.
[04:19.20]That's how you walk it back real quick.
[04:28.43]No, I genuinely don't know.
[04:30.97]My only experience with Roblox was two and a half hours two days ago.
[04:35.43]I don't know anything about the platform at all.
[04:41.22]But I had a lot of fun.
[04:43.32]I thought it was a really enjoyable experience.
[04:46.69]So I'm probably going to do more.
[04:47.51]Play with Ludwig.
[04:52.85]I got to hit Ludwig up.
[04:53.63]We wanted to do something like weeks ago.
[04:56.79]Just kind of fell off the plate.
[04:59.78]See what he's up to over the next couple weeks.
[05:09.92]Somebody said more with a bunch of question marks.
[05:12.91]I don't know.
[05:19.63]We'll see.
[05:20.27]Who knows what's going to happen.
[05:23.96]You would like Ludwig?
[05:27.12]Hmm.
[05:29.18]Maybe I'll check him out.
[05:29.82]But yeah, we're just going to chill tonight.
[05:36.40]It's going to be one of those of many more slowed down, just kind of chill, relaxed streams that I talked about back in January.
[05:44.35]Just going to play Mercenaries, hang out, chill.
[05:49.49]And that's all there is to it.
[05:56.07]Is this chill on a horror game?
[05:58.37]Mercenaries is not really a horror game.
[06:00.51]Mercenaries is more of a shooter game.
[06:04.95]Mercenaries is a wave shooting game mode that they put into Resident Evil 4.
[06:10.50]So it's not really scary.
[06:11.72]It's just kind of fun.
[06:21.85]But let's do it.
[06:24.71]It's all jump scares over and over again.
[06:27.42]Oh, by the way, I put a warning on the VOD, on the last VOD.
[06:33.08]I was considering doing a highlight to remove that really bad jump scare part, but hopefully a warning in the VOD is enough.
[06:40.89]Hopefully people saw it.
[06:45.23]It was a good warning?
[06:45.81]Okay.
[06:47.99]No, no, I'm not going to remove that.
[06:49.15]I was just making sure it was enough that people saw it.
[06:53.50]I'm not going to remove the VOD.
[06:54.56]I was going to highlight the part of that out.
[06:58.12]But then it was going to be kind of jarring.
[07:00.16]I figured a warning is probably enough.
[07:07.10]Don't you dare.
[07:16.51]The whole point of a jump scare is that there's no warning.
[07:20.13]Uh...
[07:21.81]I think a jump scare when you know a jump scare is possible is different than when it just like attacks you out of nowhere for no reason.
[07:44.41]Alright.
[07:52.20]You guys ready?
[07:56.22]How did Ster do that?
[07:57.26]That was my favorite part of the entire stream a couple days ago.
[08:02.20]Was the incredible detective work that I did in one second to accuse Ster of doing that.
[08:10.11]There's so many layers as to how that happened.
[08:14.37]It's just...
[08:16.36]If you watch that whole segment, five minutes before that segment, that whole thing, and like a minute or two after that, it's just everything in my brain was, you can even see, I'm like, oh, you did that, you piece of shit.
[08:36.24]It was just the way that, like, the turn up the volume on Ster's Discord to, hey, dude, he's quiet, he's quiet.
[08:46.12]Dude, Ster even screams right before I turn him up.
[08:51.15]I'm like, oh, Ster's quiet?
[08:52.39]He goes, ah!
[08:54.35]And then it goes, ah!
[08:56.11]So it's like, holy shit, there's no way you didn't do that.
[09:00.41]And then he laughs, he, like, laughs at... It is so unbelievable just how much I could have... I thought it was him.
[09:08.61]It's so, so funny, like, just how I thought that.
[09:11.23]I mean, the jump scare sucked.
[09:13.25]And obviously, I hope that that's not something I ever want to have to show anybody, unprompted.
[09:19.43]But the whole thing leading up to that and after that of my accusal of Ster, I think, is my favorite part so far.
[09:31.99]wrap it up Elbertson hey you did you apologize I did alright you guys ready let's just play here it is so I think you have to unlock stuff yeah okay so you gotta unlock stuff so we're gonna do village first obviously we have four characters
[10:03.07]There's Leon.
[10:06.07]I wonder who else is even in this.
[10:08.77]Because I know that... I don't want to say anything.
[10:11.01]What if you've never seen this?
[10:11.95]Is this Battle Royale?
[10:12.73]It is not.
[10:17.53]They give you more stuff this time, don't they?
[10:18.99]Okay, well, I know who these are.
[10:27.16]This is... Lewis...
[10:35.38]What's this guy's name?
[10:36.16]It starts with a... Lewis.
[10:45.96]This is Hunk.
[10:47.42]I can't think of this guy's name.
[10:50.50]Not Kramer.
[10:52.52]Krauser, yeah.
[10:53.06]Krauser, Krauser.
[10:55.73]Lewis.
[10:58.67]Alright, let's go.
[10:59.21]So how this works is you just kind of shoot, run around, and pick up stuff.
[11:06.35]You get a time limit.
[11:08.15]Defeat as many enemies as possible within the time limit.
[11:10.01]Take them out in quick succession from a combo.
[11:11.93]They'll earn you points.
[11:12.59]Yeah, you want to keep a combo together.
[11:13.71]So, we're just going to get the swing of it again.
[11:16.87]It's been a while.
[11:23.96]You get seconds added.
[11:29.01]Alright, you also want to make sure you keep combos.
[11:31.43]Don't kill everybody because you might run out of people to kill.
[11:40.31]Where are they?
[11:45.57]I remember back in the day getting a... I think it was... It was an insane combo.
[11:52.52]I forget what I used to be able to get.
[12:01.43]What is mayhem mode?
[12:04.79]What is going on?
[12:08.65]You can go, it's like extra fast attack speed and more time.
[12:15.36]So you build up the mayhem meter.
[12:18.84]Oh, wait, there's power-ups too, I think.
[12:20.20]No, don't lose the combo.
[12:21.44]No!
[12:23.24]Good, okay, we're good.
[12:23.84]I don't even think about it.
[12:31.63]Where's the barrel?
[12:32.19]There's a barrel here somewhere.
[12:33.07]Right here.
[12:35.54]Alright.
[12:41.42]Get some people to come through here and I'm going to blow this up.
[12:52.01]Shoot the barrel.
[12:53.47]Good.
[12:53.65]We're good.
[12:58.25]Ooh.
[12:58.57]Alright.
[12:59.53]Mayhem mode.
[13:01.97]Go.
[13:07.06]Oh, I'm kind of lagging.
[13:09.84]Oh shit, I'm out of bullets.
[13:14.53]Alright, big enemy coming.
[13:23.58]Oh my god, I didn't see him.
[13:32.96]Oh my god!
[13:34.10]How do I heal?
[13:36.48]Of course I know how to heal.
[13:44.56]Shit!
[13:44.92]Okay, go, go, go, get off me!
[13:47.64]Alright, I'm fine.
[13:52.51]Mayhem mode with the shotgun?
[13:58.99]I gotta get a 50 combo, right?
[14:02.38]Ooh, what's this?
[14:05.04]Open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open.
[14:14.62]Open the door.
[14:16.64]Oh my goodness.
[14:17.26]Alright, wait.
[14:21.30]I'll be happy with 50.
[14:26.26]Somebody said, is this really in Roblox?
[14:28.93]No, it's not.
[14:30.55]No, it's not.
[14:42.09]Okay, careful.
[14:42.79]Alright.
[14:47.46]Go, go, go, go, go.
[14:48.04]This way, this way.
[14:48.48]Alright, I got to 50.
[15:06.62]Oh, we're actually doing fantastic on the first run here.
[15:09.42]I'm actually impressed with myself.
[15:14.16]This has got to be going pretty well.
[15:16.76]Watch out.
[15:20.78]What is mayhem with the sniper like?
[15:27.79]Oh, shit.
[15:28.01]Alright, don't don't die here.
[15:33.27]I got a pretty good.
[15:34.11]Can I get to 100?
[15:34.51]Alright, let me heal.
[15:43.40]What do I got for ammo?
[15:44.05]I'm kind of running out of bullets.
[15:58.30]I do have aggro grenades.
[16:00.92]Okay, let's make this happen here.
[16:06.02]Shit.
[16:06.28]Get away from the fire.
[16:12.97]Oh!
[16:18.58]Boom.
[16:19.62]Yes.
[16:21.04]I gotta get some more power-ups, I think.
[16:28.53]Blow that up.
[16:30.53]That didn't kill anybody?
[16:31.33]How did that not kill anybody?
[16:39.65]Reload it quick.
[16:40.29]Come on, it's mayhem.
[16:53.51]Alright, collect.
[17:04.38]Just run.
[17:06.88]I might lose the combo, but I need to survive this if I plan on.
[17:16.45]Oh, I got it.
[17:16.87]They're throwing all these bombs.
[17:28.66]Shit.
[17:34.66]Am I not hitting him?
[17:35.24]Okay.
[17:39.90]Oh, no, no, no.
[17:40.82]I'm so close.
[17:43.66]I'm so close.
[17:44.38]I need heals.
[17:44.88]Oh, my goodness.
[17:49.48]That person's got a... Oh, my God.
[17:56.14]Oh, my God.
[18:01.07]I gotta get out of here.
[18:02.89]No!
[18:05.41]The combo.
[18:07.06]Forget about the combo, I might be dead.
[18:13.06]What did I just do?
[18:14.98]What is going on?
[18:18.44]Okay, I think I'm alright.
[18:28.63]I got 300.
[18:29.61]That's not bad for first run.
[18:41.62]Oh my god.
[18:42.26]Do the ladder strat.
[18:48.44]See if I can get any more.
[19:03.00]91, damn it.
[19:13.45]The coveted 100 hit combo.
[19:15.97]OK.
[19:18.21]Here we go, I got a... Ooh.
[19:25.97]No, that's embarrassing.
[19:35.99]Alright, so I got three... I want to try to get at least A. What is, um... At the castle... Hold on.
[19:47.44]Everybody has different weapons as well.
[19:53.14]You already beat the game?
[19:53.80]Yep.
[19:56.04]You got an S, bro.
[20:00.05]Oh, well, I looked over and somebody said they got 600,000 in their first playthrough, so I was like, oh, I won't register it.
[20:12.65]Bro, if it wasn't, if it hadn't have been for CottonEyeJoe, I'd been married a long time ago, bro.
[20:18.12]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna purge that comment.
[20:20.08]Personally, I just did it.
[20:23.08]And that's, like, kind of, like, that was kind of funny.
[20:24.87]The fact that they put long in all capitals.
[20:31.37]I would, I would have been married a long time ago.
[20:40.63]OK, let's uh, so this is mainly rifle.
[20:48.27]Yeah, Leon has like everything I will do lose.
[21:02.86]Oh, it's that I might have to change some settings.
[21:05.94]Because I feel like I'm not that efficient right now.
[21:10.05]I'm not trying to be that efficient, though.
[21:11.39]I just want to play the game mode.
[21:24.94]I got to save the rifles for much later.
[21:36.21]Come on, we go.
[21:39.98]What's going on?
[21:41.25]That was weird.
[21:42.99]That was very strange.
[21:46.73]That person stood back up.
[21:47.67]Alright, I'm gonna do stair strat.
[22:10.41]I have a big pipe?
[22:16.43]Use your ability?
[22:17.63]I will once I get enough people here.
[22:21.04]No.
[22:22.18]Whoa, what?
[22:24.28]What just happened?
[22:26.36]Oh, that's dynamite.
[22:27.52]I didn't know.
[22:28.52]Okay.
[22:29.04]I didn't know that's what he did.
[22:29.80]That's cool.
[22:30.08]Wait.
[22:30.28]I can do it...
[22:38.63]This is not in the other one.
[22:39.81]This is new.
[22:40.87]I can just keep placing them?
[22:43.00]Alright, that's good to know.
[22:53.44]Yeah, he's... I don't remember him being in there at all.
[22:55.33]You know what I mean?
[22:56.45]The words I was just trying to say.
[22:58.41]Oh, shit.
[23:00.27]Go... You know what?
[23:02.03]I got to change everything.
[23:05.53]I silently have been struggling selecting weapons the whole time I played the game.
[23:10.59]I'm gonna try to get some pullout urtles.
[23:25.94]I'm gonna get stuck here.
[23:27.18]Alright, cool.
[23:40.06]Get off.
[23:42.46]Bomb them?
[23:43.52]Yeah, like... Like hitting three and then four.
[23:47.32]I gotta memorize where these are.
[23:51.59]Seven is so hard to hit on your keyboard.
[23:54.65]It really is.
[23:56.85]It's not a simple button to press with your left hand.
[24:01.15]I gotta get down whatever it is to do the other stuff.
[24:07.17]It's a lot harder.
[24:15.56]You know what?
[24:15.88]Let's do that.
[24:19.02]Just put this shit everywhere.
[24:20.88]When can I put another one down?
[24:21.84]Okay.
[24:27.95]Do it!
[24:30.83]So you can do about three, it looks like.
[24:37.69]Shit.
[24:44.39]Oh come on, I didn't get it?
[24:45.72]I gotta get in a better spot.
[25:03.86]Why do I only have nine bullets in this thing?
[25:15.17]OK, I gotta get to a spot where I know.
[25:17.09]Those are grenades.
[25:24.20]Here we go, it's three.
[25:29.50]What did I just?
[25:31.60]OK, well.
[25:36.99]Trying to get at least gold, right?
[25:38.47]At least an A.
[25:52.51]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[25:53.51]Goodbye.
[26:10.06]Oh, you dropped?
[26:10.84]That's all you dropped?
[26:11.56]You guys didn't drop shit.
[26:22.02]Did I kill him?
[26:25.45]Oh, shit.
[26:29.91]Oh, my God.
[26:30.63]That was so lucky.
[26:34.61]That was so unbelievably lucky.
[26:42.98]Watch out.
[26:43.54]Two behind me.
[26:54.75]Alright, we're doing fine.
[26:56.13]I gotta kill that guy down there with the sniper rifle.
[27:01.78]Oh, sorry, dude.
[27:02.98]You stood up at the worst possible time.
[27:04.64]Uh-oh.
[27:08.78]Shit.
[27:16.31]I gotta kill that guy.
[27:17.25]Shit.
[27:19.19]Hold on.
[27:19.77]Don't die, please.
[27:24.26]Can I just put them on?
[27:25.40]Yeah, I can.
[27:26.70]Don't do that.
[27:31.22]That should be a pretty good place to do this.
[27:32.64]Come on, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!
[27:37.04]Yes!
[27:48.47]Okay, get out!
[27:49.43]Get out, get out, get out!
[27:53.67]Yes!
[27:54.53]That was huge.
[27:55.27]Give me this.
[28:02.12]Give me this.
[28:12.61]Shoot!
[28:23.50]I'm doing it again.
[28:30.67]Collect, collect, collect, collect.
[28:32.73]Collect.
[28:37.07]Somebody is just dropping.
[28:38.83]Okay, I'm in trouble if I don't.
[28:41.58]I don't even know where I am on the screen.
[28:43.28]My screen is just bloomed back there.
[28:57.30]Fuck you.
[29:04.09]Nice.
[29:04.35]Alright, I'm going to stay right here.
[29:07.85]Is somebody on the catapult, right?
[29:17.36]Oh, shit.
[29:17.78]I'm running out.
[29:30.68]Nobody died from that?
[29:40.32]Alright, come on, let's go.
[29:46.84]Come on, shoot it.
[29:55.99]Oh boy.
[29:56.77]Oh boy.
[30:22.31]Okay.
[30:23.19]Alright, I gotta hide.
[30:23.73]Alright, who is shooting that shit?
[30:37.02]Where are you?
[30:38.68]Where are they?
[30:41.74]Ow.
[30:44.06]Oh.
[30:46.24]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:48.68]Don't even think about it.
[30:51.89]I got a golden egg, too.
[30:52.55]I'm fine.
[30:52.83]I'm gonna lose the combo, I think.
[30:59.32]Come on, dude.
[31:00.04]Get it.
[31:01.86]That's it.
[31:02.16]I gotta move.
[31:07.10]Lucky.
[31:18.61]Oh my god!
[31:19.33]He's right there.
[31:25.35]I can't jump down?
[31:25.97]Oh my god, I can't jump down, I'm so dead.
[31:28.81]I think I just lost.
[31:30.73]I don't have any more heals left.
[31:46.56]I need heals.
[31:50.94]Is that a heal?
[31:51.70]No, it's a flash grenade, shit.
[31:57.27]Heals?
[32:01.43]No heals.
[32:03.49]I got the egg.
[32:03.99]You're right.
[32:04.35]Holy shit.
[32:04.77]Thank you, everybody.
[32:10.70]So I have a question.
[32:11.38]If the time runs out versus dying, if I die, it's over, right?
[32:15.14]Or do I still get the points?
[32:28.30]It's the same thing?
[32:28.90]Alright, I'm actually not as concerned now.
[32:34.92]Those guys gotta die, and I don't even know where they are.
[32:36.89]Nice.
[32:39.11]Okay, I gotta run.
[32:42.73]Where are they?
[32:43.43]Where are they coming from?
[32:44.31]Right there.
[32:46.57]Oh shit, that's bad.
[32:49.83]Throw it up.
[32:51.27]Throw, throw, throw, throw!
[33:08.30]Got him.
[33:16.93]I think I'm going nuts today.
[33:19.25]I'm going to lose the combo.
[33:24.98]It's alright.
[33:30.66]Kill the catapults.
[33:31.30]Yep.
[33:35.64]Move, move, move.
[33:36.22]Where is it?
[33:38.38]Where's the barrel?
[33:38.92]Dude, this shit's not even heated.
[33:41.58]I don't even know where it is.
[33:42.24]Alright, I'm gonna try to go up.
[33:52.14]Do I use the cannon?
[33:59.63]Oh, wait.
[34:00.21]More heals.
[34:00.63]Good.
[34:02.75]I'm going for the 1 million here.
[34:04.29]I'm definitely going for 1 million.
[34:08.88]Let me get to a good spot.
[34:09.44]Alright, there's the cannon.
[34:17.09]I killed everybody.
[34:17.77]Everybody's just dead.
[34:22.11]Where is that?
[34:26.37]What?
[34:26.81]Wait.
[34:27.29]Oh, I killed everybody.
[34:33.37]I killed everybody.
[34:35.17]What?
[34:35.41]What?
[34:38.26]Holy shit.
[34:42.60]I'm running around looking for to get to the next position, but I killed every single enemy.
[34:46.88]Damn.
[34:58.38]Ooh, I got Krauser.
[35:00.66]And the island.
[35:04.62]Where's your score?
[35:06.38]Yeah, let's go.
[35:09.86]That's pretty good.
[35:10.44]Alright, what is... What's Krauser?
[35:24.90]Oh, Krauser has the bow.
[35:26.08]That's right.
[35:29.56]Oh, and a machine gun.
[35:31.12]I feel like I'm not going to be very good with this character.
[35:40.24]That's right.
[35:40.60]He's got the Las Plagas arm, right?
[35:49.10]Okay.
[35:51.20]During mayhem mode, he mutates and can deal close quarters attacks with left or thrust with both.
[35:59.87]That seems amazing.
[36:07.19]I think this one so far is my favorite.
[36:11.72]Alright, let's try this.
[36:12.46]I feel like I'm going to do pretty bad here.
[36:13.60]Let's see.
[36:22.42]So this is explosive arrows?
[36:23.48]I only get three shots with that.
[36:24.86]I don't think I want to do that.
[36:27.67]Okay, let's go.
[36:34.73]I'm really not a big submachine gun fan in any of these games.
[36:38.61]As you've seen through the first playthrough you saw here.
[36:48.99]Use the knife?
[36:52.01]Where?
[36:54.06]Is it on the bar?
[36:59.72]Wait, just regular melee swinging.
[37:03.51]Oh.
[37:03.83]Okay, I thought it was like... Alright, alright, alright.
[37:21.99]I need to reload my weapons.
[37:23.39]That would be great.
[37:34.28]I'm going to save it.
[37:41.86]That's not a knife.
[37:44.26]What?
[37:52.74]Oh, die already.
[37:53.62]Die already.
[37:54.90]I missed every how.
[37:55.96]It hit every single spot around his head.
[37:57.78]I think I'm going to lose the... I'm going to lose the combo.
[38:05.87]Combo is... I did that just to keep the combo.
[38:08.45]I thought he was dead.
[38:30.39]Not doing it yet.
[38:32.58]Alright.
[38:32.78]I'll do it now.
[38:37.60]Holy shit.
[38:44.12]Alright.
[38:44.60]Stinger is both left trigger and right.
[38:49.03]Oh, okay.
[38:49.31]Hold on.
[38:49.97]We're good.
[38:52.77]There it is.
[38:53.57]That's really cool.
[38:54.61]I like it.
[39:00.46]Kill him.
[39:02.74]Yes, we're good.
[39:04.64]Get out of here.
[39:21.11]I'm running out of ammo.
[39:22.07]I need to do an ammo collection sprint here.
[39:30.19]I need ammo collection.
[39:32.25]Please.
[39:32.57]Alright, should I go left or right?
[39:35.51]Give me that.
[39:39.67]You need to use your knife.
[39:42.12]Use your knife.
[39:46.72]Is it on?
[39:46.98]What do you mean?
[39:53.51]Just use the knife.
[40:05.08]Now I got full mayhem.
[40:09.87]What is that?
[40:10.75]Who's got something weird?
[40:11.63]You do.
[40:49.22]Okay, okay, we gotta go.
[40:51.20]Okay, we gotta go.
[40:52.42]Okay, we gotta go.
[40:53.42]We gotta go right now.
[41:07.06]Okay, we're good.
[41:14.50]Keep that combo up.
[41:22.04]Collect!
[41:24.78]Collect!
[41:25.77]Oh my god, hurry!
[41:28.61]No!
[41:30.11]Yes!
[41:30.99]Oh man, alright, we're good.
[41:39.56]Constant conflict, that's right.
[41:44.62]Alright, we got two big guys coming.
[41:48.68]Two of the big bulls.
[41:50.34]Did they come?
[41:56.67]Okay, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[42:09.13]Yo!
[42:09.67]Get off me, shit!
[42:13.37]Ooh, I got clotheslined.
[42:25.38]This is gonna be insane.
[42:31.88]Nice.
[42:34.20]That's like everybody that was here.
[42:35.52]Okay, go.
[42:47.55]Die!
[42:48.43]Oh my god, he didn't die!
[42:49.99]What the hell?
[42:50.75]Why is this guy made out of fucking steel?
[42:52.88]What?
[42:53.14]I shot him a thousand times!
[43:18.89]We're going to get into a new position, start a new combo.
[43:20.63]That's all there is to it.
[43:27.75]Dude, get the fuck away from me.
[43:36.32]Come on, I just want to collect items.
[43:37.58]Wow, there's a machine generator.
[43:52.53]Oh, my head.
[43:54.25]That hurt my head in real life.
[44:05.90]You should spacebar to knife aim.
[44:10.00]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[44:29.02]Got him.
[44:30.02]Did I get him?
[44:36.73]Oh shit.
[44:37.33]Oh shit.
[44:37.85]Oh shit.
[44:39.17]That's gonna be good.
[44:46.79]Ooh!
[44:57.16]Is he dead?
[44:58.28]He's dead.
[45:00.55]Oh my God.
[45:10.65]Yes.
[45:10.95]Alright, collect and run the hell out of here man.
[45:28.93]Oh my goodness.
[45:29.83]There's too many people.
[45:32.71]There's too many people there, but I have to kill them all.
[45:38.99]Collect every item.
[45:39.61]Alright, now get the hell out of here.
[45:48.12]I'm going up.
[45:52.64]Dermot, you should eat a smoked brisket on stream.
[45:54.84]That sounds delicious, but I don't know if I'm going to be doing that.
[46:04.53]I got them both grouped up right here.
[46:05.80]Oh man.
[46:19.17]Alright.
[46:19.61]This is going to be another rest.
[46:24.52]What is it?
[46:25.26]500 K for us probably.
[46:34.00]What did I eat for breakfast this morning?
[46:35.21]Because I'm gonna eat it every single day, whatever it was.
[46:37.01]I gotta run.
[46:45.39]I need to heal.
[47:05.69]What did I eat for dinner last night?
[47:07.67]Because I'm going to eat it every single fucking day.
[47:11.56]Whatever my routine was over the last 12 hours, 24 hours, I need to go scientifically write this all down.
[47:17.52]Nice.
[47:32.93]I got hunk.
[47:33.91]Hand cannon can now be purchased in the extra content shop.
[47:37.09]What?
[47:42.61]What does that mean?
[47:47.70]The power of Roblox.
[47:53.54]Extra, where is it?
[48:03.11]no bonuses oh okay here a thousand what do you think about Dr. Dr. Ocar's paninis Dr. Dr. Ocar's does paninis since when
[48:35.53]Okay, I got an idea.
[48:36.45]I think... I want to take Hunk to the village, I think.
[48:44.52]What has Hunk got?
[48:45.20]Hunk not only has a high-performance soap machine gun, but also a unique melee attack that can kill instantly.
[48:52.43]During mayhem mode, he gains unlimited ammo.
[48:56.11]Damn.
[49:03.95]Kill instantly with melee.
[49:05.85]Try it.
[49:13.90]So is every... Is it the cool melee weapon... Melee item that's... Hold on.
[49:18.80]Let's get started here.
[49:24.19]Get an optimal route.
[49:31.83]Hmm...
[49:45.50]Sub-optimal route.
[49:47.14]Sub-optimal route, Andy.
[49:48.38]Alright, wait.
[49:50.50]The melee is instant kill.
[49:52.42]I want to get up there.
[49:55.50]We're not going to see it.
[50:07.47]Okay, alright.
[50:09.33]Looks good.
[50:12.38]You just snapped their neck.
[50:39.32]Is there a reason to press any other buttons with this character?
[50:55.95]I'm about to get unlimited ammo.
[51:06.14]Okay.
[51:06.44]Here comes the first big bad guy.
[51:10.47]Ooh, hold on.
[51:14.57]That's not good.
[51:14.97]I'm going to try it.
[51:16.81]Let's do it.
[51:21.56]Damn.
[51:22.08]Alright.
[51:22.92]I should not have used that.
[51:23.82]I didn't even know.
[51:24.44]Alright.
[51:24.72]This is so cool.
[51:27.64]I wasted that so bad, though.
[51:33.97]I gotta build that back up.
[51:37.15]I need that like right now because the big enemies just probably spawned right now.
[51:45.12]What the hell is going on with you?
[51:49.06]I hear somebody.
[51:49.82]Yep, I should have.
[51:57.32]Jesus.
[52:03.42]Collect.
[52:09.81]I got to get that built up and not use it till the double chainsaw.
[52:36.64]The next snap will instantly kill a chainsaw too.
[52:38.82]Really?
[52:39.36]Alright, that's good to know.
[52:40.84]I got to get up top.
[52:55.41]Lost items over there I got to get.
[52:57.05]And then I'm going to run up the ladder.
[52:58.13]I'm almost out of time.
[53:00.03]I need time right now.
[53:01.89]I haven't been paying any attention.
[53:02.81]I'm going to lose the combo, but I don't care.
[53:05.87]I need time.
[53:18.92]Alright, more combo.
[53:32.69]What the fuck just hit me?
[53:41.29]Oh shit.
[53:43.08]Is there another guy?
[53:44.48]I think so.
[53:49.42]Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[53:55.68]Alright, I gotta get up here.
[54:04.14]Somebody's gotta spawn, please.
[54:05.42]Alright, I wanna go up.
[54:10.20]Uh, oops.
[54:12.88]Ooh.
[54:13.04]Okay, we're good.
[54:18.56]This is
[54:26.33]Why did you take so long to reload, dude?
[54:28.01]You're supposed to be a professional.
[54:50.91]I need time.
[54:53.37]Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time.
[54:56.65]Building haven't gone in.
[54:57.45]This one here.
[55:03.07]Nice.
[55:04.13]Okay, good.
[55:04.49]We're good.
[55:08.21]Somebody needs to die right now.
[55:13.03]Yes.
[55:35.52]Oh, shit.
[55:36.08]I would really like to... Oh, boy.
[55:46.06]There they are.
[55:51.44]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[56:13.68]Oh my god, you're still alive!
[56:18.24]No!
[56:18.72]Did she breathe?
[56:19.18]She killed me.
[56:19.60]No, she didn't.
[56:23.47]Run.
[56:25.45]I thought she was dead, dead, dead long ago.
[56:35.32]I lost the combo, but I thought it was...
[56:52.01]Any more time that I didn't get?
[57:07.52]150 enemies, right?
[57:10.74]Shit.
[57:12.82]I have one more heal, I think.
[57:15.16]Actually, I'm okay.
[57:23.62]I lost the combo.
[57:24.72]Kind of panicking here for no reason.
[57:42.17]I hear them.
[57:42.99]I hear them.
[57:45.87]I hear them.
[57:46.35]Where are they?
[57:53.02]Holy shit, they're right here.
[58:12.85]I'm in trouble now.
[58:19.05]Do I need more bombs or anything?
[58:26.93]Oh, we're so close.
[58:32.85]I'm so dead.
[58:39.51]Seven.
[58:40.01]I need seven.
[58:40.53]I don't even care if it hurts me.
[58:42.11]Oh, it's alright.
[58:50.80]Fuck.
[58:51.46]Oh, I was so close.
[58:52.30]I just freaked out.
[58:57.24]Shit.
[58:58.81]Sorry.
[59:03.97]Why did I do that?
[59:04.87]I thought OK, I thought the chainsaw person was right behind me swinging.
[59:11.83]So I just try to get as many kills as possible in the last second.
[59:16.17]I thought I was dead.
[59:25.58]OK.
[59:30.00]You threw two grenades at your feet?
[59:31.94]Well, because if I threw it any further, I thought I was going to just overshoot everybody.
[59:36.17]So, right there, in my mind, I'm dead.
[59:40.29]I was just going for points.
[59:41.35]Because I was like, I'm dead here no matter what.
[59:46.40]That was fun.
[59:56.56]Hey, I'm happy with every single attempt has been an S. I'm happy.
[60:01.76]Oh, S+.
[60:02.42]I'm okay with that.
[60:08.06]I want to take Hunk to... Let me try that again.
[60:16.45]What happens if you S plus everything?
[60:19.97]I don't know.
[60:20.41]I've never done it.
[60:24.32]I don't think I even asked every level in the last time I played this in the original game.
[60:35.48]Where do I go to?
[60:36.30]I don't remember where the layout is here.
[60:40.05]How do I go up?
[60:42.23]It's a very specific ladder to go up.
[60:46.99]Alright, let me get all the.
[60:47.69]Let's try a new strategy here.
[60:54.87]S++ is the highest.
[60:57.41]Oh, come on, dude.
[60:58.03]Really?
[60:58.99]I don't think you should even shoot anything until you get all the bonuses.
[61:05.06]Try that strategy.
[61:05.80]Just hide somewhere.
[61:08.92]Where?
[61:15.82]Where are all the greens?
[61:17.04]I'm kind of wasting time.
[61:23.86]Restart it.
[61:27.18]Where are the grains?
[61:28.54]I guess it's good to kind of memorize that.
[61:31.18]This is a, uh, this is a who cares run.
[61:33.08]There's one in here.
[61:40.15]Oh, they, it's random.
[61:43.69]Uh, okay.
[61:44.43]They move around.
[61:48.99]Well, nevermind.
[61:49.51]Let's just play.
[61:55.59]Do you melee a crouched down staggered enemy with Hunk?
[61:58.41]Oh.
[62:00.27]I'm always so afraid to get in close to do a melee on the big scary enemies.
[62:03.55]I always feel like I'm going to screw it up and they're going to kill me in one hit.
[62:10.26]Try to go.
[62:15.78]Let's see if I... Hold on, I'm going to try this.
[62:36.82]You grabbed me instead of... whatever.
[62:46.22]So that's a big AoE.
[62:55.02]Okay, cool.
[63:02.74]Dude, that was somebody's grandma.
[63:18.99]Ooh, that is pretty good.
[63:20.13]I love how he does jazz hands after he does it.
[63:30.78]Don't be stupid here.
[63:49.75]Did that grenade not kill anybody?
[63:56.46]That grenade didn't kill anyone.
[64:16.55]It was a dud.
[64:24.41]Oh shit, I didn't look at my ammo that I had left.
[64:27.25]I need, I gotta get bonus time.
[64:38.18]Time, time, time, time, time over here.
[64:39.28]Need more than that.
[64:51.89]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[64:53.09]Is that an instant kill?
[64:54.41]Alright, it's not an instant kill versus the big people.
[64:57.06]Alright, let's go up.
[65:04.22]I don't wanna lose the... Shit.
[65:13.21]Oh.
[65:15.61]Oh, it has to be the next snap, okay.
[65:18.39]What is this?
[65:21.03]Every grenade, good.
[65:23.99]I just have to help.
[65:24.71]No!
[65:25.43]Why?
[65:25.77]What are you?
[65:26.23]How?
[65:26.87]Why would it have done that?
[65:28.17]It sat right on the lip of the ladder?
[65:30.25]Dude, what are you talking about?
[65:31.59]I gotta get up there.
[65:54.59]Okay, there's one over there too.
[65:55.69]I'm gonna get this one on the ground first.
[66:03.46]Shit, that's not how I get it there.
[66:11.63]Throw it!
[66:16.45]He's doing it on purpose now.
[66:28.39]Come on, I have to get it and then somebody has to die.
[66:32.53]Okay, we're alright.

[69:09.74]They all ran the other way, and that's why they're not... They all went the long way to get over here.
[69:40.10]Spin around.
[69:41.22]That's so funny.
[69:42.22]Whatever.
[69:44.11]It's humorous.
[69:50.63]Just kill 100 more.
[69:51.09]I don't think there are in the left 100 on the level.
[69:53.65]I'm going to lose this combo, but I'm going upstairs.
[70:15.91]Oh shit.
[70:18.66]Oh shit.
[70:19.36]Oh shit.

[70:51.17]Reloaded.
[70:51.57]Alright, now I just want to survive.
[70:55.43]I think there's only... There's not very many people left to kill.
[70:57.43]I'm saving mayhem mode for when the last big scary monster comes out.
[71:03.60]I need to use it now.
[71:31.85]Throw it.
[71:36.16]Somebody's on me.
[71:36.76]Alright, they're coming.
[71:44.48]They're coming.

[71:45.96]I need ammo or something.
[71:49.90]Oh, my God.
[71:50.20]They're going to come up for a second.
[71:51.33]Oh, my God.
[71:51.71]There she is.
[71:53.13]Oh, my God.
[71:53.77]There he is.
[72:01.24]I don't care if I lose the... It's okay to lose that.
[72:04.86]I'm just trying to stay alive.
[72:08.08]Break his neck!
[72:10.48]Yes!
[72:11.48]And I got mayhem.
[72:12.08]I don't even know what I'm shooting!
[72:23.15]Break her neck!
[72:23.65]Break her neck!
[72:28.85]Oh!
[72:28.91]I have no bullets!
[72:33.19]Oh my god!
[72:33.81]This is so scary.
[72:40.87]I have to do it!
[72:52.66]Come here!
[72:53.62]Yes!
[72:54.08]Oh my god, that was so fucking crazy.

[73:13.92]Damn.
[73:16.74]It's okay.
[73:18.40]Yeah, it's 1 million.
[73:27.82]Do I have an S plus with every character?
[73:29.28]I don't have an S plus with Leon.
[73:31.59]Hmm.
[73:40.28]Where's a good place for Leon?
[73:47.13]Is it going to take all of your energy?
[73:52.23]I think I'm alright.
[73:53.15]This is really fun.
[73:56.54]Maybe the island.
[73:58.06]Or island or castle.
[73:58.92]I'll try it with Leon.
[74:06.85]Chill stream?
[74:09.00]I mean, it kind of is.
[74:10.18]I'm just kind of playing the game.

[75:27.96]Okay.

[76:06.84]Whoa!
[76:09.57]I'm wasting ammo.
[76:10.25]Yeah, I am.
[76:24.16]This is actually not a bad start.
[76:25.62]It's not.
[76:26.02]Could have gone way worse.
[76:27.90]I gotta just spam E. Oh shit.
[76:48.09]I made a decision.
[76:48.67]It was to make sure I could keep the combo going.

[81:53.34]Oh, that's gonna be tricky, isn't it?
[81:57.70]Somebody die!
[82:00.50]Oh!
[82:03.54]I'm out of ammo on almost everything.
[82:09.08]Oh my god, I think this ends here.
[82:12.48]I have no fucking bullets.
[82:15.18]Shoot!
[82:17.07]Oh no, I'm so dead.
[82:19.21]I'm so dead, dude.
[82:21.21]Fuck.
[82:23.78]Wait, where's my bonus?
[82:29.28]Wait, what?
[82:29.78]I didn't get a bonus?
[82:35.67]No bonus for all the combo?
[82:39.49]No, if you die, it doesn't count.
[82:41.57]What the...
[82:46.89]Aww.
[82:47.69]I thought that meant... Like, oh, you have 110 combo going.
[82:51.87]When you die, it'll add it.
[82:52.93]You have to actually be alive still.
[82:59.85]Aww.
[83:01.27]Well, at least I got it.
[83:02.07]Hmm.
[83:10.08]I have a lot of trouble with the... What are they?
[83:12.22]The blind guys?
[83:16.43]They're really hard to deal with.
[83:17.27]I have to get S plus with Leon somewhere.
[83:22.41]Let me try here.
[83:26.98]You're doing really good.
[83:37.00]I mean, there's going to be people that do this.
[83:39.62]I look forward to watching people destroy this.
[83:48.78]good place to start.
[84:00.36]The thing about Mercenaries mode, you will play this, you will go back to the regular game and it'll be like the easiest game you've ever played in your life.
[84:15.64]You're, like, training yourself to be really good at the game in here.
[84:17.81]Oh, shit.
[84:19.11]Hold on.
[84:21.89]Um... Kind of a waste, but... Sorry.
[84:31.51]Oh, that's right.
[84:32.04]Like, professional is a thing.
[84:33.40]That's true.
[84:33.80]Need to kill somebody.

[84:45.44]No, not tonight.
[84:58.79]Sad.
[84:59.95]No peanut butter song.
[85:01.41]Sad.
[85:01.79]I want to get that time.
[85:15.10]Okay, that's not bad.
[85:34.09]That wasn't bad.
[85:34.61]Alright, let's go!

[86:31.41]I gotta keep the combo.
[86:36.15]Where did you even come from?
[86:37.01]Give me that extra mayhem.
[87:01.19]Oh, shit.
[87:06.61]Don't kill me.
[87:07.23]I'll be so pissed.
[87:11.21]You little shits.
[87:12.05]Get out of here.
[87:25.70]Oh, my God.
[87:26.56]I have to use it.
[87:40.16]on me, dude.
[87:41.34]Get away from me.
[87:42.82]How are these guys still alive?
[87:46.12]I've shot them a hundred times.
[87:47.77]I shot you a hundred times.
[88:08.78]I'm out of everything.
[88:16.20]I need ammo so bad.
[88:17.92]Get off of me, you fucking asshole.
[88:33.54]Oh my god, they're all doing the same stupid wrestling move from like WWE.
[88:37.33]Get the fuck off of me.
[88:39.09]Oh my god, it's so annoying.
[88:41.75]Oh my... What?
[88:44.01]I...
[88:46.02]I was in the... Dude, I was in the menu and I Super Mario jumped a second time.
[88:59.49]Let me just grab you from behind and hold your arms back.
[89:02.07]Let me grab you from behind and hold your arms back.
[89:03.91]Let me sneak back behind you and grab your arms from behind.
[89:06.11]Get the fuck out of here.
[89:13.26]Okay, we're good.
[89:20.03]Oh hey, did somebody just do that?
[89:21.13]Nah, don't worry dude, I'm gonna do that too.
[89:23.44]Did somebody just do that to you?
[89:24.60]Hey, watch out, I'm doing it now on you.
[89:26.52]Hey, can I sneak back behind here?
[89:37.23]That was going so well too.
[89:39.51]Three random dickheads have to just do the full Nelson move.
[89:43.74]Two or three times in a row.
[89:46.06]Fuck you guys.
[89:47.00]Fuck you guys.
[89:48.66]That move is stupid.
[89:50.14]Get out of here.
[89:51.46]Oh, hold on.
[89:51.98]Let me grab.
[89:55.15]I fucking hate these things.
[89:59.53]He just.
[90:02.71]Alright.
[90:04.77]I gotta restart.
[90:06.96]fell off the bridge alright we're good they did a what full nelson you don't know the full nelson is a is a wrestling move
[90:32.47]Bowl Nelson is a wrestling hold in which one arm is passed under the opponent's arm from behind.
[90:37.41]And then, well, they didn't grab my neck, but you get the idea.
[90:43.05]God damn it.
[90:43.73]I'm so salty over that.
[90:45.39]Everything was going so smoothly.
[90:46.77]I was doing so well.
[90:53.61]I got to use the, the, the pitcher's mentality.
[90:57.73]The major leagues, major league baseball.
[91:00.98]If you throw a pitch, it gets destroyed.
[91:05.14]Out of the park, home run.
[91:06.94]You have to forget it just happened.
[91:08.88]Otherwise, you're going to get all messed up.
[91:12.01]You got to get back on the mound and just act like it never happened.
[91:15.39]That's what pitchers do.
[91:16.03]Alright, let's go.
[91:39.59]Somebody's going to be behind me in a second.
[91:41.29]Somebody right here.
[91:42.11]Okay.
[91:42.55]Hi, guys.
[91:43.33]How did I not hit all of them?
[91:45.33]I don't know how I didn't hit everybody there.
[92:03.76]Oh, God.
[92:04.06]Where are you?
[92:13.99]This level is actually kind of difficult.
[92:34.70]Where is everybody?
[92:45.87]Remember, you're my fourth favorite funny man.
[92:48.43]Oh, thanks.
[92:48.97]That's cool.
[92:49.57]I'm honored to be in your top five.
[92:51.45]It means a lot.
[92:54.07]Thank you.
[93:11.66]Good, good, good.
[93:12.52]Alright.
[93:12.74]Everything's fine.
[93:17.13]Get some reloads.
[93:17.75]Alright, I gotta get this.
[93:21.79]Boom.
[93:24.66]Right here.
[93:26.80]Shoot the barrel.
[93:27.94]That buys me an extra second or two.
[93:29.74]Got all the shotgun shells.
[93:32.24]Okay.
[93:58.83]I can't believe I missed that stupidly.
[94:01.65]Alright, we're fine though.
[94:02.63]Everyone relax.
[94:07.82]Okay, go.
[94:15.02]Oh my god, I thought I died.
[94:15.90]I thought he killed me instantly.
[94:23.60]Holy shit, look at this thing.
[94:26.84]DO IT!
[94:28.46]Oh my god, it's like playing Tomb Raider sometimes.
[94:35.86]Dude, I... Oh my god, you little bug fuckers, get away from me.
[94:58.46]Did I have ammo?
[94:59.12]Oh shit, it is.
[95:14.90]Flashbang the bugs?
[95:16.30]Thank you for reminding me.
[95:27.39]Yes!
[95:27.89]Alright, sick.
[95:31.25]Alright, we're on the run.
[95:37.08]Can't, uh... Uh-oh.
[95:53.83]Wowee!
[96:04.28]Oh my god, I'm out of everything.
[96:15.79]You have to die right now.
[96:24.84]Shit.
[96:34.94]Give me that S+, I can taste it.
[96:36.32]I can taste it.
[96:37.45]Give me that S+, I can smell it.
[96:53.98]Fuck.
[96:56.48]I have to get rid of some of this shit.
[97:24.78]100!
[97:26.28]Alright, we're good.
[97:33.91]Uh-oh.
[97:44.00]Alright, I gotta... I gotta... Oh my god!
[97:48.46]Run!
[97:55.66]That guy's gonna rocket.
[97:58.02]Goodbye.
[97:58.38]Reload it, please.
[98:10.59]Oh my goodness.
[98:16.36]Oh my god, how am I still... I don't care.
[98:18.98]I don't care.
[98:19.34]It's okay.
[98:21.14]We're okay.
[98:21.52]We're okay.
[98:21.88]We're okay.
[98:22.22]Everyone relax.
[98:25.04]That was just a, that was a little fucked up.
[98:26.82]That guy's going to fold mouse at me and I'm going to scream.
[98:31.37]Why are you reloading this gun?
[98:32.97]Who told you to do something so stupid?
[98:41.95]Oh!
[98:52.35]I gotta do scopes here.
[98:55.81]I'm so stressed out right now.
[98:57.40]I know I'm supposed to be chilling out, but god damn.
[99:12.77]Don't even think about it.
[99:19.30]Oops!
[99:26.74]Dude, get me out of here!
[99:28.96]I can't move!
[99:30.34]I can't move!
[99:31.69]Help!
[99:34.55]Holy shit, I'm so fucking dead here, guys.
[99:44.62]I can't combine these?
[99:51.98]Wait, what?
[99:54.78]I can't do one red?
[99:57.14]That's kind of annoying.
[99:59.46]Alright, I gotta go this and I gotta flashbang immediately.
[100:05.53]No!
[100:08.97]You gotta be kidding me, dude.
[100:10.57]Give me a fucking break.
[100:11.49]It's alright.
[100:16.57]Still got it.
[100:19.69]Still got it.
[100:21.58]Oh, that would have been so awesome if I had got it.
[100:23.54]Damn it.
[100:24.44]I got it though.
[100:25.04]It's okay.
[100:29.82]It's so addicting.
[100:30.40]This is a lot of fun.
[100:38.20]I can S plus with every character at least once.
[100:42.05]I want to take Krauser to the village.
[100:48.51]The time bonuses I think are doing it to you.
[100:50.15]Yeah, probably.
[100:50.95]It's true.
[101:06.88]Oh, I know, I know.
[101:07.81]Knife, knife, knife.
[101:09.43]Use the knife, I know.
[101:13.13]I should only be using the knife the first, like, two or three minutes at least.
[101:37.68]He's fun.
[101:53.09]Honestly, maybe I should just avoid the bonuses until like really actually until like maybe a minute.
[102:12.88]Yeah, where's Ada?
[102:14.18]Wasn't Ada in this?
[102:15.66]And Wesker.
[102:16.88]Are they just not in it?
[102:18.24]Did they replace them?
[102:35.41]Damn.
[102:36.97]Prowzer is insane.
[102:43.32]If they're in the game files, they'll probably be DLC.
[102:46.82]I wonder.
[102:47.24]Alright, time to...
[103:12.56]So that ends the combo.
[103:14.06]It's good to know.
[103:16.90]Whoa.
[103:22.11]It's not good.
[103:25.01]Okay, come on.
[103:25.85]There's a series of unfortunate events right there.
[103:27.63]I, like, have not had control of my character in, like, 12 straight seconds.
[103:30.44]Fuck.
[103:32.48]It's bad.
[103:48.83]Wait, what?
[103:52.53]They're on the roof.
[103:53.53]I know.
[103:53.85]Why did I explode?
[104:00.04]What the hell is that?
[104:02.56]Oh, I got tunnel vision there.
[104:03.80]Let's try it again.
[104:13.72]It was an RPG on the roof.
[104:19.16]Yeah, I tunnel visioned there for an extra second or two that I shouldn't have.
[104:33.08]How many can I fit in one room?
[104:35.30]You know what I mean?
[104:39.62]I want to do an experiment.
[104:50.47]Maybe they don't spawn.
[104:51.95]They're fighting each other.
[105:01.72]They can't get to me, so they... Okay.
[105:13.23]I think you have to kill people to have it spawn.
[105:23.11]Mom and dad are fighting.
[105:27.65]Alright.
[105:30.85]Try this.
[105:38.14]I'll get this one because it's close.
[105:44.58]This should be plenty of time.
[105:57.31]Come here.
[106:05.49]Don't lose the combo.
[106:11.77]Alright.
[106:15.04]I need to kill somebody.
[106:27.38]Okay, first big guy coming up in a minute.
[106:33.42]There is a mayhem thing right there.
[106:36.04]Use it now.
[106:38.01]Let's see if I can kill these last few guys over here.
[106:50.51]Alright, that was pretty good.
[107:07.56]Alright, I gotta get killed now.
[107:08.58]I guess I'm dead.
[107:20.22]Alright, here comes big guy.
[107:28.29]Where is he?
[107:30.47]Where is he?
[107:32.85]There you are.
[107:47.86]Okay, a lot of people coming.
[107:49.14]Alright, I gotta collect items.
[108:02.71]Up on the roof, thank you.
[108:14.74]Yep.
[108:15.40]Uh-oh.
[108:39.28]Okay, here they come.
[108:44.08]Where are they?
[108:47.10]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:49.18]Yes.
[108:55.52]No shit.
[108:55.96]Okay, let's go.
[109:03.34]Got it.
[109:12.76]How did I miss such an easy... Whatever.
[109:23.11]Collect.
[109:27.83]Okay.
[109:28.15]This is going to be a good bonus.
[109:31.33]I'm going to lose the bonus eventually here.
[109:33.65]And then I need to get into one of the buildings.
[109:37.03]Nice Roblox player accuracy.
[109:39.15]I'm doing alright.
[109:55.09]Alright, next spawn I think is coming in a second.
[109:56.58]I have tons of time too, that's good.
[110:19.59]Alright, let's go.
[110:21.09]When's the next spawn?
[110:29.47]Okay, I gotta throw this.
[110:40.27]Uh-oh, that's not good.
[110:41.41]I have to use one of these right now.
[111:01.16]No, somebody died from that.
[111:02.60]Yes.
[111:03.38]Thank you for killing that person.
[111:04.36]I appreciate it.
[111:17.97]I'm just going to use it.
[111:18.61]That shit going to hurt me?
[111:25.56]Not really.
[111:30.97]Alright, here they come.
[111:32.27]Got it.
[111:34.93]There's one more.
[111:36.11]I think she's right behind me.
[111:50.76]Got her.
[111:51.52]No, she's still alive.
[112:02.48]Oh, she's still alive.
[112:03.52]What are you made out of?
[112:04.42]Okay, that's... Alright, I gotta run.
[112:25.29]Well, this is such a bad place to go.
[112:28.57]I don't even know why I decided to go up here.
[112:34.59]I don't know why I did this.
[112:39.23]That may have just saved everything.
[112:40.39]Go.
[112:47.18]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[112:50.36]Let's go.
[112:50.72]Come on.
[113:02.62]I'm saving this at the very end.
[113:03.74]I'm not going to use it.
[113:15.58]I don't care about the combo anymore.
[113:16.70]I just care about making it all the way.
[113:18.20]Watch out.
[114:02.15]Come on, it's alright.
[114:05.61]Alright, this is where we actually have to kill everybody.
[114:13.46]Oh my goodness.
[114:14.22]I was gonna activate it, now.
[114:20.22]Alright, just one more.
[114:28.42]Where are they?
[114:29.10]Wow, they're behind me.
[114:37.21]I did it all.
[114:39.78]Clean.
[114:40.07]We're good.
[115:05.68]Alright.
[115:07.92]Too bad I didn't get 130 combo.
[115:10.02]129.
[115:10.04]Oh, so close.
[115:10.52]Damn it.
[115:10.86]Oh, close.
[115:39.63]I wonder what happens if you get S with every character.
[115:42.27]Not S++ is basically an F. It's probably not even on the leaderboard if it's not S++, probably not.
[116:03.26]I'm curious.
[116:10.71]Can you show Hunk again?
[116:11.53]Yeah, I'll do it after this.
[116:16.28]I have achieved what I wanted to achieve.
[116:17.94]Now we're just playing for fun.
[116:24.71]I got S plus with every character.
[116:26.27]That's all I wanted to do.
[116:39.58]Can anybody confirm if there actually is anything for getting everything on S or S plus?
[116:46.62]That move actually is really good.
[117:05.41]No, you just get the hand cannon.
[117:07.86]Still pretty cool.
[117:25.00]Cool.
[117:26.48]Cool.
[117:28.78]Aw, I wanted to use the... I felt bad for that guy.
[117:40.04]I don't know if that guy was actually attacking me.
[117:55.30]Alright, time to item collect.
[118:03.79]I already unlocked the hand cannon?
[118:05.85]Yeah, I thought I did.
[118:09.98]It just costs 1000 points to actually use it.
[118:23.92]Alright, where is the where are they there?
[118:28.96]Okay, somebody's behind me.
[118:33.64]You can shoot the dynamite.
[118:44.33]Oh my God.
[118:52.44]That's how you finish it.
[118:54.10]That's how you finish.
[119:05.55]Uh-oh.
[119:07.81]I'm going to lose it.
[119:11.39]No, I'm not.
[119:11.83]This is really kind of sloppy, but I think we're alright.
[119:27.77]My character is definitely Krauser for sure.
[119:33.51]Krauser is probably everybody's character.
[119:36.35]Considering he's... Hunk is really good, but I like the special on Krauser better.
[119:40.57]We can't have you all be swarming me like that.
[119:54.41]Okay, let's go ahead and just activate it now.
[119:57.89]He spawns over here, doesn't he?
[120:00.53]Oh jeez.
[120:00.83]He's right there.
[120:11.27]Oh boy!
[120:11.79]Whoa!
[120:18.00]Too many people.
[120:26.49]Oh, he's behind me.
[120:27.60]No, please.
[120:36.28]I can't shoot it.
[120:36.88]They're all dead.
[120:44.87]Yes.
[120:45.41]Okay, reload.
[120:50.17]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[120:52.83]That's not what I wanted!
[120:54.21]What?
[120:54.79]Fucking full Nelsund, of course.
[120:57.79]Dynamite does not hurt you.
[121:21.37]Oh.
[121:24.85]You need to tell me I've been messing that up this whole time.
[121:33.39]I gotta get out of this area.
[121:36.74]I'm going to reset the combo.
[121:38.56]Go get a time and run away.
[121:41.34]OK, timer up here.
[121:48.30]I can hear them coming.
[121:49.98]Let's go ahead and just preemptively do this because I'm afraid.
[121:52.58]Thank you for hitting me.
[121:55.17]Appreciate it.
[122:02.97]I think this is a full minute and a half.
[122:08.11]This is going to get ugly here in a second.
[122:22.04]Holy shit.
[122:26.38]Why does he keep doing that?
[122:29.19]Why does he keep throwing grenades at himself?
[122:31.37]Why is he doing that so much?
[122:34.75]I don't know, dude.
[122:56.04]Where's the... There's so much health everywhere.
[123:06.39]Holy shit.
[123:08.31]Look at all this.
[123:08.79]Where are they?
[123:39.49]I'm freaking out.
[123:44.35]Oh!
[123:45.59]I thought you said it didn't hurt me.
[123:47.31]I thought you said it didn't hurt.
[123:49.31]That hurt a lot.
[123:50.83]That was incredibly painful.
[123:57.72]That hurts me.
[123:59.94]They were lying to me.
[124:10.90]my way I'm so dead here I'm not making out of this one no way I have to oh my god no way dude it's not gonna happen oh my goodness it actually yeah I don't even know what just happened but I'm alive
[124:42.64]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[124:44.12]I'm stuck up here.
[125:06.13]Come on, man, let's go.
[125:14.09]Alright, here they all come.
[125:15.98]Where are they?
[125:44.68]Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.
[125:58.39]No!
[125:59.41]Why did that happen?
[126:01.07]What are you talking about?
[126:01.91]Oh shit.
[126:10.87]Oh my god, she's over here!
[126:12.77]Get down, get down, get down.
[126:17.26]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!
[126:21.64]No!
[126:23.78]What do I have for stuff?
[126:27.68]I need to reload this.
[126:39.31]Oh shit!
[126:53.08]I have to get out of here.
[126:54.39]Get out of my way, please.
[126:56.79]I have to get out of here.
[127:01.55]Wait, there's an explosive barrel right here.
[127:03.07]There's one down.
[127:09.01]There's only one left.
[127:10.37]Only one left.
[127:12.31]Only one left.
[127:14.31]This dude is just turning.
[127:15.47]I'm alright.
[127:16.19]I'm okay.
[127:16.69]I'm alright.
[127:17.19]Oh!
[127:22.31]There's gotta be a fucking grenade in here.
[127:23.92]Is there a grenade in here?
[127:31.18]Yes!
[127:32.60]Oh, thank god.
[127:33.46]Oh my god, that was so fucking scary.
[127:37.58]I got S+.
[127:38.18]We're good.
[127:42.38]Oh my goodness gracious.
[127:56.27]My goodness gracious.
[127:59.41]Nice.
[128:05.37]Yeah, I mean, I got a little scared.
[128:07.03]It's supposed to be a chill stream.
[128:11.73]Yeah, no, it is.
[128:13.49]That laugh was legit psycho.
[128:16.55]You turned into the Joker.
[128:26.50]Tony said Beavis and butthead maniacal laugh I'm just gaming man.
[128:32.80]I don't know what you guys are even talking about on Let me see let's hear it oh shit
[128:53.73]I mean, I would say it's more like Bale from Diablo II.
[129:02.79]Put some filters on that.
[129:04.47]Put some echo on it.
[129:05.73]And some kind of grunge on it.
[129:06.89]And that will be when you stand still in the, uh, what, the world sanctuary?
[129:11.36]Wherever it is.
[129:12.86]And it goes like... Right?
[129:13.70]That's...
[129:23.56]That's what I would have said.
[129:28.21]My brothers will not die in vain, vain, vain.
[129:40.92]Here's Bale's laugh.
[129:41.60]Okay, let's see.
[129:42.26]Let's compare it.
[129:53.67]My brothers will not have died in vain.
[130:06.82]You know, I always thought I was a bail.
[130:12.12]I was going to pick what Diablo character.
[130:28.15]I gotta ask with everybody on here.
[130:42.28]I know everyone's saying, dude, um, excuse me.
[130:49.83]Leon's not my character.
[130:55.67]Somebody wanted to see hunk again.
[130:58.58]Uh, we'll play Hunk here.
[131:08.10]What am I going to do after this?
[131:09.86]Um, I don't know.
[131:10.38]I kind of just planned on playing whatever.
[131:11.46]I didn't, this wasn't gonna be like a super duper long, long stream or anything.
[131:16.03]I just was.
[131:19.81]I'll pivot to something else maybe.
[131:23.43]Uh, probably not Breath of the Wild.
[131:24.90]I was thinking about that, but my Switch is not, um, not set up right now.
[131:30.18]I played, um, I don't know, I just put the Switch into bed because it was, oh, Breath of the Wild.
[131:37.93]I was playing it.
[131:38.67]That's cool.
[131:40.81]And I kind of just started playing random Switch games.
[131:49.91]And one of those random games.
[131:51.11]I was playing the WarioWare for Game Boy Advance.
[131:55.75]Didn't I stream that game a while ago?
[132:03.67]Vampire Survivors.
[132:06.35]I played a lot of the DLC off camera, so I have seen it already.
[132:15.88]Play some N64 games.
[132:19.40]I'm down for that.
[132:19.94]Don't want to lose the combo.
[132:32.77]Do the Hitman Freelancer.
[132:34.47]I would.
[132:35.11]I promise you I would.
[132:36.65]I just don't have Hitman installed right now.
[132:38.51]And that game is like 700 million gigabytes.
[132:41.79]And I don't really, I don't think I can really install it on stream.
[132:43.81]I probably could, but it would take like 20 minutes or so.
[132:46.22]30 minutes.
[132:53.24]That one down.
[132:53.86]I wonder, can you turn off the power or do you just store it?
[133:15.18]Crew crew.
[133:18.32]Um, maybe.
[133:20.48]Hmm.
[133:29.67]Maybe.
[133:29.97]Someone's probably gonna drop behind me.
[133:36.84]Nope, we're good.
[133:45.83]Everybody spawned?
[133:46.37]I need to break some more necks.
[134:11.74]Okay, let me get this.
[134:13.82]Actually.
[134:14.22]Let's just do it again.
[134:16.12]Why not?
[134:20.90]Come on.
[134:21.46]What's with the stun lock?
[134:31.82]There we go.
[134:32.70]Alright, I got plenty of time.
[134:33.50]I don't need time anymore.
[134:34.62]Oh, shit.
[134:46.05]Let's just deal with that.
[134:49.53]What about DOS?
[134:54.68]After after I do this one, we'll.
[134:58.38]Take a look what we have for options.
[134:59.36]There's something else like an hour or two.
[135:03.62]Where are you?
[135:06.64]There you are.
[135:08.62]Break his neck.
[135:14.25]I actually don't mind being down here.
[135:29.92]Easy.
[135:34.86]Don't even fall Nelson right now, please.
[135:48.47]Okay, collect.
[135:54.23]And then I'm gonna go out this way.
[135:55.69]Oh, I gotta get the 100 combo.
[136:03.72]Yes.
[136:16.32]I'm gonna use a couple grenades.
[136:21.96]Oh, shit!
[136:22.56]Those things kill you instantly.
[136:24.40]Yes, they do.
[136:25.49]I may have just blown it.
[136:29.57]I completely forgot those things kill you instantly.
[136:31.19]Oh, thank god.
[136:37.50]I'm good.
[136:45.62]Alright.
[136:47.20]Crisis absolutely averted right there.
[136:49.14]I'm going to lose the combo.
[136:52.18]Or am I?
[136:55.98]Nope, I'm not.
[136:56.67]That guy just annihilated me.
[137:15.76]Okay.
[137:15.98]Getting there.
[137:21.38]100!
[137:21.40]Where are the others?
[137:35.33]Where are the others?
[137:37.73]I didn't want to use this for no reason.
[137:48.82]Okay.
[137:50.42]That's done.
[137:50.88]It's the last one.
[138:00.82]There's one more person.
[138:02.00]I don't know.
[138:02.42]Oh, they're dead.
[138:02.86]They're dead.
[138:03.24]They're dead.
[138:10.81]Shit.
[138:12.47]Oh.
[138:15.61]Oops.
[138:24.09]Alright, I think I'm going to stick right here until the end.
[138:28.14]I'll have mayhem mode.
[138:29.92]I might be able to actually get 150.
[138:31.08]This is actually a big deal.
[138:32.18]Hold on.
[138:42.40]I got really scared there.
[138:43.42]That's my own fault.
[138:44.08]Alright, here we go.
[139:12.77]Oh shit!
[139:19.07]This is the one!
[139:19.95]This is the one!
[139:20.71]This is the one!
[139:43.64]Come on!
[139:55.87]I did it!
[140:00.55]Where's the last enemy?
[140:02.65]Where's the last enemy?
[140:09.27]Oh my god, yes!
[140:14.40]Holy shit.
[140:15.94]Oh, I did it.
[140:18.50]Oh, that's... Thank God.
[140:20.58]Oh my God.
[140:21.93]I thought I was going to miss it big time right there at the end.
[140:29.03]There it is.
[140:29.39]Nice YouTuber reaction.
[140:33.69]Oh, that was real.
[140:34.89]That may have sounded fake.
[140:38.38]That was genuine.
[140:39.32]I was about to get really, really sad.
[140:40.88]Oh.
[140:45.41]Can I register my name?
[140:47.91]Yeah.
[141:01.30]Stinking.
[141:01.72]1.1 mil.
[141:07.42]1.1 mil.
[141:09.08]1.1 million.
[141:12.42]Does anybody know what the maximum score is
[141:18.55]Check the leaderboards.
[141:25.49]Dude!
[141:27.43]I'm the 10,611th best gamer in the world on Island with Hunk in Resident Evil 4 Remake.
[141:56.06]You know what's really kind of wild about this?
[142:01.71]That was hard.
[142:02.81]That was like really challenging, really hard.
[142:06.01]There are so many people that are so good at this shit.
[142:08.49]It's unbelievable.
[142:12.42]Cool.
[142:14.88]Well, I don't know if I'm going to do much better than that.
[142:20.20]Look at number one.
[142:25.53]A village.
[142:28.25]How do I go?
[142:32.66]By ranking?
[142:33.14]How do I sort it?
[142:40.00]Tab.
[142:43.77]So 2.5 million is the highest you can possibly get.
[142:46.07]That's probably everywhere.
[142:55.56]2.5 million.
[142:55.90]2.5 million.
[142:59.43]2.5 million.
[143:01.23]It's all Leons too.
[143:06.23]Probably because the point multiplier for Leon.
[143:13.33]It's crazy what S++ does.
[143:16.40]So all of my S pluses are like, oh, I think I did a pretty good job. 46,000.
[143:22.51]But if you get an S++, you almost instantly teleport up to like the top 10,000.
[143:28.89]That's kind of interesting.
[143:36.49]So what's the next layer then?
[143:37.83]I guess, let's see.
[143:39.81]Looks like 1.1 seems to be the highest to get out of here.
[143:46.27]I wonder.
[143:48.09]Let's go here.
[143:48.63]Let's do start at 1.
[143:53.41]At what point does this become... Most people are not doing more than 2 million.
[144:00.49]2.1 seems to be a pretty hard cutoff.
[144:02.60]Because then you've got half a million points that are only 7 slots.
[144:09.26]That looks like 2 million is doable.
[144:10.98]Somewhere between 1.5 to 2 is pretty doable, it seems.
[144:15.07]And these aren't even with full combos.
[144:23.76]Yeah, seems like 1.5.
[144:27.44]1.5 is where all the god gamers live.
[144:30.94]That's definitely the case.
[144:33.84]Cool.
[144:36.46]Alright, I'm going to take a quick break.
[144:37.70]That was really fun.
[144:39.74]This was Resident Evil 4 Remake's Mercenaries mode.
[144:44.72]I heavily enjoyed it.
[144:48.50]I'll play something else for a little bit.
[144:52.04]We'll figure it out when I get back.
[144:53.60]I'll take a look.
[144:56.01]I'm going to go pee.
[144:56.55]I'm going to get a drink.
[144:57.61]And I'll see you guys in like a few minutes.
[144:59.41]Five minutes maybe.
[144:59.91]See you in a minute.
[145:58.65]Oh, my mic is still on you.
[146:01.31]I'm just looking at my steam.
[146:04.80]Hot bike, hot bike.
[146:09.12]You know what's funny?
[146:13.17]Anytime I go BRB, even if I know the mic is muted, I don't do, I don't talk until I'm out of the room.
[146:22.34]Like if I have to burp or fart or something really bad, I, even if I mute it over here, I'm doing, I'm not doing that till I'm out of the room.
[146:31.63]I just don't, sometimes I just don't trust it.
[146:33.49]I don't know.
[146:35.45]But I'll, uh, alright.
[146:36.65]I'm looking at my steam.
[146:44.32]We heard it.
[146:50.71]Paranoid Perry.
[146:54.43]Well, let me tell you something.
[146:58.57]If I'm not paranoid Perry, and for some reason I'm sitting here, and I rip ass really, really loud with a BRB screen up,
[147:11.51]You want to talk about a clip that will be shared 100,000 times forever?
[147:18.61]You guys will link that to me and hide it.
[147:21.37]Like, oh, hey, dude, Diablo 4 is getting some updates.
[147:25.09]Click this, and it's going to be me farting with the BRB screen.
[147:29.83]I know what you guys are capable of.
[147:30.93]Alright, I'll be right back.
