[00:06.94]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.49]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.17]And tonight, I'm not sure what I'm going to be playing as.
[00:17.95]And it doesn't really matter, because this video is not going to talk about Team Fortress 2.
[00:23.25]It's not going to talk about Smite.
[00:26.16]I don't know why I just brought up Smite.
[00:27.74]There hasn't been a Smite video on this channel in like 70 years, but...
[00:32.26]It's going to talk about how this as this whole YouTube thing has truly been like the most humbling experience of my entire life.
[00:41.58]And this is not a subscriber milestone video.
[00:44.52]It's not like, thank you for 150,000 subscribers.
[00:47.53]No, this is not like any video like that.
[00:50.05]It's just something I've wanted to do for a long time is talk about this in a little bit more detail than I ever have.
[00:56.47]And I figured it would be a good idea to do it right now because I'm in the mood to talk about it.
[01:02.64]So what am I getting at here?
[01:03.76]What's the point here?
[01:04.58]What am I talking about?
[01:05.84]I'm talking about when people send me comments or tweets or personal messages, I read them all.
[01:11.98]I really do.
[01:12.74]I promise you guys.
[01:14.14]I read all the comments.
[01:15.22]I read all the tweets.
[01:16.18]I read all the personal messages.
[01:18.14]It's just too much to ever be able to reply to them.
[01:21.40]I think Gabe Newell famously said, I don't reply to them all, but I do read them all.
[01:26.96]We're talking about emails.
[01:29.02]I'm the same way.
[01:30.06]I can't reply to them, but I do read them, and I do appreciate them.
[01:34.19]But why I bring up this topic of comments and people sending me messages is, what I get a lot of times in any of my inboxes are people telling me that the videos that I make, the content I make, whether it's a comedy video or a discussion video, anything, it helps out their life.
[01:51.35]They watch it and they feel better about themselves.
[01:53.46]They feel better about the world.
[01:55.14]They're going through depression.
[01:56.18]They're going through some tough times.
[01:58.10]And they watch these videos from a YouTuber like me.
[02:02.42]And it helps them out.
[02:04.20]And I'm not going to solely say that, like, oh, it's just because I'm such a good YouTuber.
[02:08.51]It's a lot of different people.
[02:09.45]There's a lot of people on this website that make fantastic content.
[02:12.79]Very uplifting, fun, awesome content.
[02:15.25]I'm not the only one that makes videos.
[02:16.99]There's plenty of other people.
[02:18.64]But knowing that what I'm doing could potentially be helping somebody else in a much deeper way than I ever could possibly have imagined is life-changing.
[02:28.88]Being able to directly impact somebody else's life through video content
[02:35.03]It's amazing.
[02:36.11]And I really, truly hope that I can help out in any way I can, guys.
[02:39.81]If you're watching the videos for fun, and then you move on, if you're watching the videos to get away from something, I'm glad I'm here.
[02:46.12]I'm glad there's a lot of us here on this site that can help you do that, that can help you through that.
[02:49.80]And I mean that from the very bottom of my soul.
[02:54.07]I really do mean that.
[02:56.08]A lot of you guys already know this.
[02:57.82]I've went through fucking all kinds of depression in the last, you know, 10 years.
[03:02.98]I'm not perfect.
[03:04.80]I'm not a perfect guy.
[03:05.82]Like, I'm not.
[03:07.02]I've gone through plenty of problems in my life, and I've gone through plenty of issues, and I've gone through plenty of times where I've been like, you know what?
[03:12.70]Fuck it.
[03:13.93]But the more you dwell on stuff like that, the more you're going to bring yourself down into a place you don't want to be.
[03:19.98]You don't want to be there.
[03:21.18]Trust me on that.
[03:21.88]You do not want to be there.
[03:23.60]You want to be up.
[03:24.32]You want to be high.
[03:24.98]You want to be on the mountain.
[03:25.82]You want to be shouting from the mountaintops, baby.
[03:28.37]Sawmill.
[03:29.35]That was a reference to one of Star's videos, but whatever.
[03:31.53]You want to be in a position where you're happy.
[03:34.99]And if I can help you get there, if I can help you do that with these videos, then God damn it, I'm going to keep doing it.
[03:43.08]And I'm going to try my absolute hardest to make the best videos I can, to make the funniest videos I can, to make the most entertaining videos I can.
[03:50.84]That's what I'm all about.
[03:51.92]That's what this channel is all about.
[03:53.61]This channel is not about...
[03:55.79]Anything else.
[03:56.89]That's the number one thing.
[03:58.13]That's the number two thing.
[03:59.29]That's the number three thing.
[04:01.35]The top three things of my channel are that.
[04:04.70]And everything else is underneath.
[04:07.44]And the whole purpose of this video, the whole reason why I made this video, why I opened up Audacity, why I started talking in the first place...
[04:14.36]is to say thank you to those of you that have watched these videos that you know it's not a subscriber milestone like I said in the beginning not like oh 200k no I just want to say thanks because me making videos that you guys enjoy or that help out your life in some way anyway makes me want to be a better person
[04:33.53]Makes me want to strive to make better content, strive to make better videos, more entertaining things, have more ideas, more experiments.
[04:40.11]It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jerma upstairs in my noggin lately, because I got a lot of ideas, and I want to do them.
[04:46.01]But we're not going to go into that now.
[04:48.33]And to close this video out, I'm only going to take another about 30 seconds or so in this video, is... If you're having problems, if you're having real problems...
[04:58.15]Talk to somebody.
[04:59.32]You have to.
[05:00.24]You have to get in touch with somebody because it's not healthy to stay mad, to stay depressed.
[05:05.92]It's not a healthy thing.
[05:07.86]I know.
[05:08.90]I know.
[05:09.43]Take it from me.
[05:10.81]I know.
[05:11.41]You don't want to be sad.
[05:13.01]You don't want to be depressed about certain things.
[05:15.21]You want good old grandma Foklestein to help you.
[05:19.13]That's a new character.
[05:19.83]I don't know who that is.
[05:21.38]You want to be happy.
[05:22.76]So try to get happy.
[05:23.88]Try to find ways to make you happy.
[05:25.14]And if I can make you happy, like I said, God damn it, I'm gonna keep fucking doing it.
[05:30.01]So, thank you everybody for watching.
[05:31.79]Really do appreciate it.
[05:32.93]I'll see you guys all next time.
[05:33.95]And of course, take care, everybody.
