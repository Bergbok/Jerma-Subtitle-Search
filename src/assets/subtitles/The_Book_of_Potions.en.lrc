[00:12.09]You didn't think we were going to play every single Wonderbook game?
[00:19.25]Let's make a potion.
[00:20.35]The cure for boils.
[00:21.99]Alright, so I gotta make this potion and he's gonna drink it?
[00:28.03]Crush snake fangs.
[00:40.11]pungent onions, dried nettles, a dash of flabberworm, mucus, and a sprinkle of ginger.
[00:46.56]This is a lot of ingredients!
[00:48.77]Dude, why don't you just go to CVS and get fucking boil cream?
[00:53.79]Why do I have to do all this?
[00:55.90]They make, like, Neosporin.
[00:56.86]Oh, shit.
[00:57.08]No, no, no.
[00:57.26]Go this way.
[00:57.76]Get out of here, Dobby.
[00:59.94]You're tracking mud all over my Wonder Book.
[01:02.66]Get out of here, dude.
[01:03.72]Dobby, get off the book.
[01:05.60]Dobby, get out of here.
[01:21.41]What, page three?
[01:22.57]Keep an eye on those pictures.
[01:24.03]They'll always tell you what we're doing next.
[01:28.65]Dobby.
[01:29.59]A hopping cauldron.
[01:31.21]Oh, shit.
[01:32.70]Dobby, get out of the potion.
[01:34.48]At least until you try mixing flux weed.
[01:36.42]I don't think he's supposed to be here.
[01:39.34]Right at it.
[01:40.24]Then hold the move button to start lifting it up.
[01:45.63]Okay.
[01:46.85]Am I making a potion or am I Looney Tunes style cooking Dobby in a pot?
[01:52.90]This is fucked up.
[01:53.78]Okay.
[02:03.34]This is evil.
[02:04.48]Get him out.
[02:05.30]Get him out.
[02:06.02]Dobby, get out.
[02:07.60]Get out of the... Get out, please.
[02:09.10]Ooh.
[02:09.19]Ooh.
[02:18.00]Say the same line again, please.
[02:19.64]How much is in this?
[02:47.67]Trying to get some of it in the corner.
[02:49.43]This thing is still going.
[02:50.59]What a mess.
[02:51.87]You need to be really careful when you're using your chopping tools.
[02:56.73]Because there's a chance that you might cut yourself.
[03:02.50]Ah, that hasn't been chopped quite enough.
[03:07.06]Ah, that wasn't chopped enough at all.
[03:10.58]This time we must save it over a load.
[03:12.71]Hey buddy, who's holding the knife?
[03:14.91]Okay, I did it right.
[03:21.24]That's it, keep the heat there.
[03:25.94]Yes!
[03:27.53]Are you still with me?
[03:28.67]Press the move button to clip off some of the nettle.
[03:36.85]Hold the clippers close.
[03:39.46]Another power cure for boils.
[03:49.92]We still need that ingredient.
[03:51.40]Pick it up again.
[04:01.91]It'll cure him.
[04:04.05]It'll get him in there.
[04:04.87]Just dunk him a little bit.
[04:09.06]Come on, Doffy, get in there.
[04:12.04]Doffy, we're curing your fucking warts.
[04:18.60]Put my hand down.
[04:26.28]Oh, dude, he's sucking my blood!
[04:27.80]Oh, how much is he gonna drink?
[04:34.42]Okay.
[04:35.54]I just let these things drink a bunch of my blood.
[04:38.26]Now I'm gonna kill him, mash him up, and put my blood in this potion.
[04:43.63]You wanna get arrested?
[04:44.95]That's how you get arrested.
[04:46.21]That's how you get the health inspector to be like, you're putting blood in your fucking food?
[04:50.21]Your blood?
[04:52.73]My restaurant's gonna be closed.
[04:57.04]My blood wasn't green?
[05:00.01]Why is this implying that I had green blood?
[05:06.97]I don't have green blood!
[05:09.73]I- I'm pretty- my blood's red.
[05:12.65]Oh!
[05:27.14]That's it!
[05:34.59]Now, use your wand, pick up the fish and fling it towards him.
[05:42.85]That's it!
[05:48.88]Stupid, that's covered in shrinking solution.
[05:54.89]he's just a little baby he certainly won't stop us passing by now can this chop
[06:17.74]But here it is again, flighty thing.
[06:20.99]Just keep quiet and still now.
[06:25.61]Boo!
[06:27.35]You know what the most fucked up thing is this entire time?
[06:30.66]I haven't even had a chance to sample my own material.
[06:33.44]I haven't had a chance to drink my own fucking potions!
[06:36.86]That's changing right now.
[06:44.05]Whoa!
[06:45.92]Whoa, that's spicy.
[06:47.68]Woo!
[06:48.98]Woo!
[06:49.90]At first, I really didn't think I was gonna like that, but man, that was pretty tasty.
