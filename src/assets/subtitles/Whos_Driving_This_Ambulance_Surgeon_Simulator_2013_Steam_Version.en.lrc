[00:08.40]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:09.95]It's Dr. Jerma here.
[00:12.21]At my desk, using my mouse and my keyboard, going to put some patient files into the directory.
[00:17.81]Let's see here.
[00:22.10]Anyways, I'm a doctor now, as you know.
[00:24.24]I have my doctorate in surgery.
[00:25.74]Let me just get this telephone here for a second.
[00:28.82]Hello?
[00:29.26]I don't care.
[00:33.11]I'm a goddamn doctor now!
[00:35.67]Get this phone off the desk!
[00:39.33]Oh, everything must go!
[00:42.31]We are going to do an ambulance mission.
[00:44.50]Now, what this is, you will see very shortly.
[00:48.24]In addition to the original game, you can do stuff in ambulances, and I've never done it before, and it's incredibly difficult and crazy, so here we go.
[00:56.72]Gonna do the transplant, heart transplant, in the ambulance.
[00:59.35]Here we go, baby.
[01:01.67]Get this off.
[01:03.87]Thank you.
[01:05.67]So far, so good.
[01:06.55]How am I gonna do this here?
[01:10.80]I should probably... Hey, like, watch the potholes, asshole guy driving the car.
[01:17.96]Okay.
[01:18.65]The back of the door just opened.
[01:19.87]Are you serious?
[01:24.33]Come on.
[01:24.83]Come on!
[01:27.03]What are we doing?
[01:27.41]Are we on like a roller coaster right now or a road?
[01:29.87]No, I'm gonna lose my tools!
[01:32.57]Hold on, where's the, uh... Wait, there it is.
[01:35.31]Come here!
[01:35.77]Come here!
[01:38.93]Come here!
[01:40.37]Pick it up!
[01:41.63]Okay, here we go.
[01:43.21]Nice and easy, nice and easy.
[01:45.87]Get me into that rib cage!
[01:50.07]Hey, can you like stop at a Taco Bell while you're at it?
[01:52.21]I'm like kinda hungry.
[01:55.12]Jesus Christ.
[02:00.73]I'm gonna kill this guy.
[02:05.21]I'm legitimately going to kill this guy.
[02:08.11]I almost got the rib cage done.
[02:10.71]Get this out of here.
[02:12.15]Get this glass tube off the guy.
[02:13.91]Come on.
[02:14.41]Hold on.
[02:16.91]I gotta... I gotta start to move some of this stuff.
[02:19.81]Do not lose this.
[02:21.35]Put it down right there.
[02:23.86]Yeah, we'll, like, throw this at an oncoming car.
[02:26.52]Oh, the door's not even open anymore.
[02:30.22]Okay, good, good, good.
[02:31.53]So far, so good.
[02:33.91]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[02:36.31]No, no!
[02:38.97]I still need to open this!
[02:40.91]Come here!
[02:43.36]And everyone thinks I'm on drugs.
[02:45.40]This- The whole point of this game is- Oh, great.
[02:47.60]There's a saw in his body.
[02:49.30]The whole point of this game is you're supposed to be like a guy on drugs.
[02:51.68]Like, that's the joke.
[02:53.32]Who's the guy driving the car?
[02:54.82]How many beers did this guy have?
[02:58.24]Come on!
[02:59.82]No, I'm gonna lose this guy already.
[03:01.72]Here we go, here we go.
[03:05.68]That's what I want.
[03:07.13]That's what I want!
[03:08.77]Just shut up for a second, car.
[03:10.71]Get that toaster out of the way.
[03:12.35]That- Oh!
[03:14.71]Where's the heart?
[03:16.43]Where's his heart?
[03:18.19]Where's the heart that I was supposed to transplant?
[03:19.71]Did it go out the back door?
[03:22.15]Oh, it's already over.
[03:24.89]He's losing a lot of blood.
[03:27.21]It's necessary, though.
[03:28.63]It's completely necessary.
[03:31.43]No, hold on to it still.
[03:34.63]Don't have to waste my syringe.
[03:36.05]I need to, like, feed this guy drugs so he doesn't die.
[03:40.63]Almost, almost.
[03:42.31]No, come on.
[03:45.31]Alright, where's the syringe?
[03:47.03]Wait, there it is!
[03:47.45]There it is!
[03:47.75]Come here!
[03:49.43]Come here!
[03:50.57]Come on, stick him in his face!
[03:53.78]Yes!
[03:55.22]Yes.
[03:56.28]We're good.
[03:56.86]We are good.
[03:58.36]Just need to cool it here.
[04:00.92]Don't want to lose the hearts right here.
[04:02.52]Oh, no.
[04:03.54]God, that heart's gonna fly out the back.
[04:05.73]Protect the heart.
[04:06.39]Protect the heart for the time being.
[04:08.19]Okay, the doors are closed.
[04:10.35]God damn.
[04:12.13]Get out of the way.
[04:15.25]I still gotta get those two pieces of ribs out of there.
[04:19.15]I gotta get those, like, riblets from chilis out of there.
[04:21.97]Alright, so far so good, so far so good, so far so good.
[04:27.46]No, I need to cut those, I still need to cut those.
[04:29.50]No, don't put that, no!
[04:31.94]Come here!
[04:33.78]This thing's gotta go, this is gonna fly into his face and kill him.
[04:37.74]Come over here.
[04:38.84]Where's the scalpel?
[04:40.70]I just need a scalpel.
[04:42.96]Come here, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[04:46.57]No!
[04:47.09]No!
[04:49.87]No, I just got hit with the drugs.
[04:52.81]This is going to be ten times more difficult now, because I am on, like... Whatever the hell it is.
[04:58.31]Morphine.
[05:02.79]No, dude.
[05:03.53]Are you serious?
[05:04.27]I was so close.
[05:06.97]I don't even know what I'm cutting into right now.
[05:09.03]Hopefully his heart.
[05:12.38]This is going to make me die.
[05:13.52]I'm going to throw up looking at this.
[05:16.81]Is the heart free?
[05:17.89]I can't even see.
[05:19.01]I think the heart's free.
[05:20.45]I have no idea.
[05:22.45]Let's see if I can pull it out.
[05:25.43]Nope.
[05:28.69]Easy.
[05:30.78]I just gotta cut into the... This is gonna be really bad, guys.
[05:35.12]Where is a scalpel?
[05:36.30]Can I please find a scalpel in this mess of an ambulance?
[05:44.22]I got a tool.
[05:44.80]Here we go.
[05:48.23]Slice these ventricles.
[05:49.07]Slice these ventricles.
[05:54.77]No!
[05:55.85]I gotta cut one more!
[05:56.91]Cut one more!
[06:00.51]Get out of the way!
[06:02.25]No!
[06:05.75]Good, good.
[06:06.03]Open that up.
[06:06.63]Throw all these out.
[06:08.33]Out.
[06:09.11]Out.
[06:09.63]Out with you.
[06:12.09]Out with you.
[06:12.73]Out with you.
[06:13.17]Out with you.
[06:13.53]Out with you.
[06:17.07]I don't think I have enough blood.
[06:18.05]I think he's going to lose too much blood right here when I try to cut him.
[06:24.55]Come on.
[06:26.89]There it is.
[06:28.47]One more precise cut.
[06:29.57]Right there.
[06:31.07]Right there.
[06:34.38]Right there.
[06:35.80]Cut it!
[06:38.26]Got it.
[06:39.92]Now we just need to cut the ventricles.
[06:42.66]I'm like leaning into the computer right now, guys.
[06:45.26]This is like so intense.
[06:49.72]There's one, right?
[06:50.78]No?
[06:55.23]Give me that cut!
[06:57.03]Give me that cut!
[06:58.57]There it is!
[06:58.91]I gotta get this last one!
[07:02.41]I got it!
[07:03.15]Got it!
[07:03.65]Got it!
[07:04.05]Wait, no, did I?
[07:04.81]There's one more.
[07:05.47]That red one.
[07:07.32]Holy Jesus!
[07:09.54]Where's the heart?
[07:10.58]Where's this other heart?
[07:11.32]Come here!
[07:14.22]Pop it in the air!
[07:16.29]No!
[07:16.89]No!
[07:17.89]No, get in!
[07:19.21]Get in his chest.
[07:20.77]Get in there.
[07:21.92]Get in.
[07:23.16]Yes!
[07:25.82]Wow, that was ridiculous.
[07:27.78]That was intense.
[07:28.46]I can't even imagine doing, like, the brain surgery.
[07:30.82]There's brain surgery, there's kidney transplants, and heart transplants.
[07:35.07]I have no idea how the hell you'd be able to do that with the brain transplant one.
[07:38.46]But anyways, guys, that's Surgeon Simulator 2013.
[07:41.55]And it's on Steam right now.
[07:42.73]I believe it is $10.
[07:45.28]I could be wrong.
[07:45.90]I believe it's $10 on Steam.
[07:47.74]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[07:48.86]Thank you so much for watching.
[07:50.46]Take care, everybody.
