[00:01.04]Just a typical day in Team Fortress 2.
[00:03.02]Let's go outside.
[00:04.14]Oh, there's a sentry right there.
[00:05.96]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[00:07.20]Oh, another sentry.
[00:08.70]Oh, pretty sick.
[00:09.36]Oh, we got a third sentry over there.
[00:11.40]Let's just keep going.
[00:13.28]I mean, there can't be more than that.
[00:14.75]There can't be like a fourth sentry over here.
[00:17.11]I mean, it's like a dispenser.
[00:18.79]I mean, there's another sentry going up over here right now.
[00:22.67]We have seven engineers.
[00:26.62]Seriously, like Dust Bowl in a nutshell.
[00:29.08]Oh my god.
[00:30.16]No one's gonna be able to even get over here!
[00:41.35]You know, they don't even need me.
[00:42.96]I don't even have to be here right now.
[00:45.64]There's seven engineers on this team.
[00:48.94]All I have to do is just stand over here.
[00:51.32]Just stand in between the dispensers.
[00:53.68]And just watch.
[00:56.15]Yay!
[00:58.09]Come on!
[00:59.49]Come on!
[01:05.09]Oh, they got a sentry!
[01:10.81]Oh, the spy!
[01:18.84]That's not fair!
[01:19.92]I hit him right in his face!
[01:24.78]I don't know how I didn't hit that spy.
[01:30.88]This guy's just healing me.
[01:33.30]He wants me to get this taunt kill so bad.
[01:35.86]Did you guys just see that spy?
[01:44.94]Dude, that guy missed like four backstab attempts in a row.
[02:01.35]Oh my... I just killed the whole team.
[02:07.18]Oh my god, I just killed like the whole team.
[02:09.70]Look at the chat.
[02:10.58]Wow, that was so dumb.
[02:15.22]I just killed the entire team.
[02:20.84]Wow, this whole team is really mad about that.
[02:23.23]I would probably be too.
[02:25.17]I would be livid about that one.
[02:31.04]Alright guys, we're gonna be playing Frog Pyro, let's go, let's do this!
[02:37.02]Okay guys, we're gonna be playing Frog Pyro, let's go, let's do this!
[02:43.97]It's insta-die.
[02:51.63]Blow up, blow yourself up on me!
[02:55.60]I didn't even need to do that.
[02:59.38]Now they're pushed back.
[03:01.26]There's one.
[03:02.54]There's two.
[03:03.50]Let's try... Come on, don't... Ladies and gentlemen, here comes... The Shmee.
[03:20.41]The Shmee.
[03:22.19]Here comes the... Shmee.
[03:25.67]My name is Shmee.
[03:26.89]Your name is Shmee.
[03:30.17]You got me.
[03:34.25]But you didn't- NO!
[03:36.87]Come here, come here!
[03:51.85]Well... Well, uh, please- Oh jeez, oh jeezus, you just shot me.
[03:59.32]You fucker!
[04:05.80]We only got 10 seconds.
[04:08.94]What?
[04:10.04]What?
[04:11.55]What is this guy doing?
[04:15.13]We just did it, we just did it, we just did it, we just did it, we just did it good.
[04:26.41]That's how we do a little bit of zhuzh.
[04:28.99]That's how we zhuzh it up.
[04:30.99]Wanna see some zhuzh?
[04:31.85]You wanna see some zhuzh?
[04:33.79]You ready?
[04:35.29]Here we go.
[04:36.45]Zhuzh.
[04:37.99]I'm gonna zhuzh this guy up.
[04:39.45]Got him.
[04:40.54]This guy needs a zhuzh.
[04:42.38]This demoman around this corner is getting zhuzhed!
[04:45.60]I zhuzhed him, but... Medic saved his life.
[04:51.76]Alright, I gotta zhuzh somebody before this is over.
[04:54.62]Somebody's gotta get zhuzhed.
[04:57.05]You gotta zhuzh him up.
[04:58.99]We go zhuzh him up right here.
[05:03.07]I could have zhuzhed.
[05:10.12]How did I miss that headshot?
[05:11.92]Somebody explain it to me.
[05:13.64]I want to get a calculated mathematician to explain to me why you... You're being a real dick right now.
[05:25.89]That was funny.
[05:27.76]That was for the- What the f- I just can't stop eating these.
[05:36.57]What are you eating?
[05:37.27]501 bars.
[05:40.01]Stop eating 501 bars.
[05:42.03]Why are you doing that?
[05:43.19]I've only had two.
[05:46.04]I've only had two.
[05:47.00]I had one last night though.
[05:48.24]You were gonna get such like a compacted shit.
[05:50.58]It's not gonna even be funny.
[05:52.58]They're so good.
[05:53.88]You are gonna crap out like a cement block.
[05:57.63]I need to, like, get these, but not as fiber bars.
[06:01.78]I know they make them.
[06:04.82]It's okay, we're getting spawn camped right now.
[06:08.00]It's okay, don't worry, Star.
[06:09.20]We're getting spawn camped.
[06:10.82]And you're not even here to help, okay?
[06:13.38]I'm not worried.
[06:14.41]So those of you guys that are watching right now, we're on Dust Bowl, and- You're not even going to use this clip.
[06:21.11]Why not?
[06:23.66]Because I'm not in the video.
[06:25.04]So?
[06:26.10]I could just like, cut you out.
[06:27.73]I might even be talking to nobody right now, guys.
[06:29.85]Like, so if- Star was never fucking even here, okay?
[06:35.82]You're a psycho.
