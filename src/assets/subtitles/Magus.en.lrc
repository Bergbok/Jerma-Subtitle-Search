[00:05.05]Fucking OBS.
[00:16.21]We're back.
[00:16.79]We're back.
[00:18.07]I don't know how many people fucking took off.
[00:23.41]We're right here.
[00:24.40]We're back.
[00:24.72]We're right here.
[00:26.98]Don't worry.
[00:27.36]We're fine.
[00:32.41]Shit, I'm... Six viewers!
[00:34.23]Yeah, we got six fucking viewers.
[00:36.81]We're good.
[00:37.77]Don't worry.
[00:46.80]Six viewers.
[00:54.58]I told you to stay.
[00:56.68]I asked you to stay.
[01:00.08]Told you we weren't even close to being done.
[01:07.57]Give me one second.
[01:08.35]I'm going to change the title.
[01:09.88]This is going to be the end of this stream, by the way.
[01:11.64]Friday Night Fuckface PS3 stream.
[01:21.76]Can I not spell this right?
[01:28.74]Play Spore.
[01:29.62]Do you remember the last time I played Spore?
[01:32.76]It was awful.
[01:34.08]It was not good.
[01:38.41]It was bad.
[01:40.25]Alright, this game is not going to take, like, fucking ten hours to install.
[01:43.28]It's already done.
[01:46.82]Move back.
[01:47.18]Just hit the refresh button.
[01:48.56]Just, like, press the button.
[01:50.36]Press the button.
[01:51.10]Like, let's do some... Put your 3D... Put your 3D glasses on.
[01:53.90]You know what I mean?
[01:54.36]Ready for this one?
[01:55.14]Like, whoa.
[01:55.96]You know what I mean?
[01:56.38]Like, whoa!
[01:57.32]He's, like, in your face.
[02:07.08]We're already back.
[02:10.97]That was so loud.
[02:12.85]I don't know where that came from.
[02:15.49]But it was really fucking loud.
[02:19.12]Why did that happen?
[02:19.86]I'm so sorry.
[02:20.68]I'm so sorry, guys.
[02:24.56]There's no way I could predict that was going to happen.
[02:26.16]I'm so sorry.
[02:28.38]That was fucking ridiculous.
[02:35.09]You ready?
[02:40.29]This is Magus.
[02:45.01]This game has like a 2 out of 10 on IGN.
[02:47.65]Who cares about any of this?
[02:56.16]Is this a spooky game?
[03:02.24]Nudity.
[03:16.10]Okay, I didn't expect that.
[03:17.28]That was kind of cool.
[03:28.24]Okay.
[03:31.48]I don't know how long this stream is going to last, by the way.
[03:36.79]This could be over in 10 seconds.
[03:41.51]By the way, this guy looks like when you open up a character creator...
[03:47.08]This is the default face and hair that's there.
[03:54.53]Difficulty?
[03:55.15]Fucking normal.
[03:56.75]Music?
[03:57.15]Turn it down a little.
[03:58.81]Vibration?
[03:59.39]Get that shit out of here.
[04:00.53]Fire buttons?
[04:01.27]L1, R1, L2, R2.
[04:03.78]I like that better.
[04:06.60]New game.
[04:07.46]There we go.
[04:10.16]I hope there's not black bars this whole time.
[04:19.02]Alright.
[04:22.94]This is me.
[04:23.56]I didn't get to customize this guy at all.
[04:30.99]This is gonna be bad.
[04:34.15]Who do I play as?
[04:42.33]Will somebody say something?
[04:43.33]You seem to be well-dressed, especially for a convict.
[04:47.00]Great.
[04:47.42]Fashion tip from a tavern wench.
[04:48.84]Who the hell are you?
[04:49.60]You also might stab me in the back.
[04:52.04]Cut the crap and just say what you have to say.
[04:54.06]I'm listening.
[04:54.64]Use your brain.
[04:55.10]If I could get us out of this place, don't you think I would have done it already?
[04:58.62]Meaning what?
[05:15.34]For years, I've been going in and out of the prisons of the Empire in search of someone.
[05:20.66]And this someone is... I'm not really sure.
[05:24.43]Maybe I can help.
[05:27.43]Repeat this phrase.
[05:28.95]If I am of the blood, by the right of my almighty divine powers, I claim this world for my own.
[05:35.27]By the right of my almighty divine powers, I claim this world for my own.
[05:39.68]Please forgive my insolence, Lord Magus.
[05:43.99]I feel different.
[05:44.47]Sure as hell don't feel like a god.
[05:45.71]Don't bother.
[05:46.07]Why don't you just use these godly powers to get us out of this shithole?
[05:48.81]Whatever.
[05:49.03]This guy is really... This is how I feel.
[05:50.79]Whatever.
[05:51.03]Let's go.
[05:51.23]How do I fight?
[06:11.60]Press the X button to absorb magic from objects.
[06:15.82]Army of One.
[06:18.74]Press R1 to use basic magic and press and hold R1 to auto-fire.
[06:22.73]I'm getting a bunch of fucking achievements.
[06:37.64]Why did I buy this game?
[06:44.03]I purchased this game.
[06:48.51]How do I get out of here?
[06:53.31]How do I get out of the room?
[07:01.24]How do I get out of the room?
[07:03.40]Huh?
[07:06.81]Huh?
[07:14.02]Money well spent.
[07:18.02]Get me out of here.
[07:33.08]I found a health potion.
[07:34.89]That's very useful.
[07:37.01]That's very useful right now.
[07:41.32]I did make a joke about this lasting 12 seconds.
[07:43.46]You're right, I did.
[07:45.28]You're absolutely right.
[07:46.24]Got it.
[07:52.65]Oh, dear God.
[08:13.32]KILL THEM ALL
[08:49.63]How much was this?
[08:50.91]I don't know how much this was.
[08:53.11]This was, I think this was like, I think this was $12.
[08:55.42]That's 12 bucks.
[09:14.31]Why is it playing a cut scene?
[09:18.31]What else do we got?
[09:22.39]God damn it.
[09:23.45]What is legendary?
[09:25.12]We're fucking putting it in.
[09:28.42]I'm pressing the
