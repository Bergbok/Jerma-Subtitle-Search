[00:06.93]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.75]Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[00:12.76]Welcome to Scare Saturdays.
[00:14.00]This week I'm going to be playing Eerie, and I'm recording this intro after I just got finished with the session of me playing the game.
[00:22.38]The reason why I'm doing it like this is because I need to say this.
[00:27.17]This is hands down the most intense, terrifying,
[00:31.41]scary game I've ever played in my entire life.
[00:35.01]If you are into scary games and you've never heard of Eerie before, go get it right now.
[00:39.02]It is completely free.
[00:40.18]It's actually a student project from somebody.
[00:42.74]And, oh my God, guys, just watch this video and see the complete true terror that is Eerie.
[00:48.94]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[00:50.12]Enjoy the video and take care, everybody.
[00:57.53]Eerie.
[01:02.39]Oh, what is that noise?
[01:05.87]Is that a baby crying?
[01:07.03]Alright.
[01:09.87]Missing personnel following partial meltdown and blah blah blah.
[01:12.79]Investigate whereabouts of missing workers.
[01:15.29]Locate survivors.
[01:16.29]I want to read that, man.
[01:19.17]Hey, I want to read the rest of that note.
[01:22.05]What the hell?
[01:22.61]I'm trying to examine.
[01:23.31]Here we go.
[01:24.11]Locate survivors.
[01:25.13]Mitigate further damage.
[01:27.27]So gain entry to plant grounds and use spray paint to mark... I didn't... Let me read the goddamn note!
[01:34.25]Use spray paint to mark casualty locations and danger areas.
[01:39.75]Okay.
[01:41.11]Whatever, let's do it.
[01:43.43]Where's my spray paint?
[01:45.71]Can I like... Oh, shift to sprint.
[01:48.03]Oh my god, this guy's superhuman!
[01:50.45]He can run like a thousand miles per hour.
[01:54.45]There's the spray paint.
[01:56.52]Thank you for the spray paint.
[02:00.46]Is it an unlimited supply?
[02:01.62]Oh, wow.
[02:04.31]Hopefully this... Okay, I'm not going to waste this because I know somebody's going to say, Jerma, you run into the goddamn can.
[02:10.59]Don't... It's like lamp oil.
[02:13.27]Anyways, let's...
[02:15.94]Let's go.
[02:16.66]What the hell is that?
[02:17.18]These pictures of this dude?
[02:18.90]Yeah!
[02:19.70]Yeah!
[02:20.50]Yeah!
[02:21.22]Yeah!
[02:21.82]Yeah!
[02:23.08]He whips it up so fast.
[02:24.22]Alright, let's crawl.
[02:29.56]Get me out of this stupid little terminal.
[02:35.13]Oh, I hate when it's like this.
[02:37.09]Get me out of this tiny little corridor.
[02:38.85]Thank God.
[02:48.29]Alrighty.
[02:49.47]Another note.
[02:50.73]You gonna let me read it this time?
[02:54.05]What the?
[02:57.67]What the hell is going on?
[03:01.45]Run!
[03:04.91]Stop that noise!
[03:11.42]Which way do I go?
[03:13.28]I'm assuming I gotta go this way.
[03:14.38]This stupid alarm is freaking me out right now.
[03:20.08]Oh, I can do a running slide?
[03:22.82]Alright, hold on, I gotta tag where I've been.
[03:25.63]Uh... I need to... Figure eight.
[03:29.89]Alright, that's the figure eight.
[03:31.17]I know I've been here.
[03:35.73]Just... Shut up!
[03:43.15]Can I turn it off?
[03:43.85]There's blood all over the place.
[03:48.77]Okay.
[03:49.45]What?
[03:50.25]Oh, that was the glass.
[03:51.17]Is anybody in there?
[03:55.12]Alright.
[03:56.46]Tag.
[03:56.82]Oh, this guy like... This guy like tagged this way better than I could.
[04:03.88]I don't like how fast my character moves.
[04:05.92]I'm not gonna use the sprint feature.
[04:08.22]The guy moves way too goddamn fast.
[04:10.32]It's like...
[04:11.55]Bats!
[04:12.07]Bats!
[04:12.91]Bats!
[04:17.16]That was stupid.
[04:23.82]Mark this.
[04:26.86]I like that feature, though.
[04:27.70]That's a really cool feature.
[04:29.60]You can mark where you've been, so you don't get, like, lost.
[04:36.15]Somebody crying?
[04:41.13]I don't want to go down this hole.
[04:44.45]I'm crying with you, man.
[04:47.27]I'm crying with you.
[04:49.83]I don't want to go in this.
[04:50.90]Can I just take your, like, keycard for a minute?
[04:52.88]Thanks.
[05:00.40]Another cat.
[05:00.94]Where's the cat?
[05:02.28]I'll save you, kitty.
[05:04.51]Gotcha.
[05:06.25]Gotcha, cat.
[05:10.77]Spray this like alien neon green piss.
[05:19.41]It's getting really foggy right now.
[05:24.98]Wait a minute.
[05:27.12]Wasn't I already here?
[05:30.92]Associate doctor... I'm not reading all this.
[05:32.92]Subject was placed in cryogenic preservation with... Hold on, so something broke out of, like, cryogenic preservation?
[05:38.33]Let's look at that again.
[05:39.61]Right, they placed a cryogenic, which suffered a power interruption.
[05:42.35]All subjects on the series were... dead or something.
[05:46.91]Which way?
[05:48.71]Let's go this way.
[05:49.67]No, let's go down there first.
[05:50.78]I definitely have to do something down here.
[05:53.80]Sure thing.
[05:54.30]Maybe it's this way.
[06:02.37]Yep.
[06:06.92]Any fish in there?
[06:17.64]Offline.
[06:18.28]Offline.
[06:19.28]We believe the injuries are due to the worksite proximity of the ingric of Fermi-1 actor.
[06:23.52]Reactor.
[06:24.95]Reactors.
[06:27.36]Ladies and gentlemen, this is your principal speaking.
[06:30.32]There's a fucking monster right next to me right now, and I'm not going to be in school tomorrow.
[06:35.28]I'm so fucked.
[06:48.16]I'm so fucked right now.
[06:49.39]I'm so fucked.
[06:50.67]Oh my god.
[06:52.29]Oh my god, this thing is...
[07:03.82]Where do I start?
[07:04.46]Do I start over again?
[07:05.46]Oh, I don't want to deal with that again!
[07:08.46]Oh, for the love of God, I'm not going in this... Where is he?
[07:13.64]He's over here.
[07:14.14]I don't even know if I forget where he is.
[07:17.06]Which way was he?
[07:17.96]I completely forget where he was.
[07:19.46]He's right there!
[07:20.08]He's right there!
[07:20.70]Oh my God, that guy's horrible!
[07:24.56]I don't know what to... That's why there's a sprint feature.
[07:28.87]This is insane.
[07:30.13]Oh, I got the key.
[07:32.63]I got the key.
[07:32.97]I got the key.
[07:38.22]Oh, this sucks!
[07:39.50]This.
[07:40.24]This.
[07:41.12]Sucks.
[07:43.10]I already have the thing I need.
[07:44.28]Wait, let me look at my inventory.
[07:49.95]I got the lab lobby key and the G1 key.
[07:52.21]Okay, so I am not go- I- How am I supposed to do this?
[08:04.06]Let's go the other way.
[08:06.69]Women.
[08:07.05]Women's room.
[08:07.63]Women's men room.
[08:08.67]Women's men's room.
[08:10.20]Oh my god.
[08:11.38]Crawl underneath it.
[08:15.88]Oh my god.
[08:16.70]He can't get in here.
[08:17.34]Can he?
[08:18.84]Can he?
[08:19.32]Please tell me he can't get in here.
[08:22.56]He can't get in here, right?
[08:23.40]I don't know where he is.
[08:31.52]I duked him out.
[08:32.12]I duked him out.
[08:33.87]Go, go, go!
[08:34.79]Run!
[08:35.11]Sprint!
[08:36.39]Get me outta here!
[08:38.31]Get me outta here!
[08:44.19]Is that guy still chasing me?
[08:45.41]Please don't tell me he's still, like, here.
[08:49.50]I lost him, I think.
[08:52.50]Restricted super- Oh my god!
[09:01.41]I am speechless right- I am speechless right now!
[09:11.17]I'm just running in random directions, guys!
[09:17.92]This is the most terrifying game I've ever played.
[09:21.24]This is the scariest game I've ever played.
[09:25.35]If you want the scariest game on the internet, it's probably this one.
[09:34.55]Access granted.
[09:35.17]Get me out of here.
[09:37.25]I don't know if I'm supposed to be here or not.
[09:38.75]Please, like, electrocute the grid so he gets electrocuted and dies.
[09:46.60]Get me out of... Get in the game.
[09:48.14]Oh my god, I don't think I can play this anymore.
[10:04.28]Scariest game I've ever played.
[10:06.09]Scariest game I've... You son of a bitch.
[10:10.23]You're not getting me in here.
[10:15.05]This guy is like Slender on crack.
[10:18.01]This is Slender on crack cocaine.
[10:21.74]Because not only does he follow you like Slender, he runs a thousand miles per hour.
[10:26.32]I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.
[10:37.10]Wait a minute.
[10:38.10]What about through this door?
[10:43.72]Maybe I wanna go this way.
[10:45.54]Where's the other generator?
[10:47.22]I haven't been tagging anything.
[10:48.90]I don't even know where the hell I'm going.
[10:50.79]It's not that way.
[10:51.81]It's not that way!
[10:52.61]It's already been that way.
[10:56.93]Oh shit, I hear him!
[10:58.61]Oh my god, oh my god!
[11:03.29]I haven't been in this room.
[11:07.10]No, don't read the note.
[11:08.82]Oh, I'm cornered in this room!
[11:16.34]Done.
[11:17.33]Done.
[11:17.99]Scare Saturdays is over.
[11:19.67]Goodbye.
[11:20.79]Goodbye.
[11:21.99]Thank you all so much for watching.
[11:23.21]I can't do this anymore.
[11:24.05]This is insane.
[11:25.39]This is ridiculous, dude.
[11:27.47]I don't know how far I got.
[11:28.81]I hope maybe I got like halfway through this game, but... This is too much.
[11:33.09]This is too much.
[11:38.39]That's too much.
[11:38.99]Okay, thank you so much for watching.
[11:40.04]I really do appreciate it.
[11:40.70]Take care, everybody.
[11:41.36]I'll see you all soon.
[11:42.01]Goodbye.
