[00:01.73]Oh, jeez, I've got so much work to do.
[00:03.88]Oh, goodness gracious.
[00:10.48]I don't want to talk to him right now.
[00:14.44]Hello?
[00:16.45]Yes, I'm aware that I owe the reports next Tuesday.
[00:20.91]Yes, I don't care.
[00:21.89]I don't want to talk to you anymore.
[00:23.79]I'm a professional fucking businessman, and I don't care.
[00:27.15]Good day.
[00:30.41]There's my files.
[00:41.23]Okay, it's time to be a total dickwad.
[00:44.15]If you don't know how to be a total dickwad on two-foot, I'll show you.
[00:48.55]So what you want to do is you want to disguise as a friendly sniper.
[00:52.57]Go out here, make sure you have whatever sniper rifle they have out, pull out the dead ringer, and just pretend like you've never played this fucking game ever before in your life.
[01:01.35]I don't, hey, where, where do we start, where's the spawn?
[01:04.64]I don't, I, uh... And then you come back here, go on in your, uh, into your resupply, and do it again!
[01:13.36]Hey, I don't know what time is it, I've never played...
[01:24.11]Mom?
[01:26.27]Mom, how do you play Team Fortress 2?
[01:32.35]Oh shit, the gig is up.
[01:33.61]The jig is up.
[01:35.43]No, it's not.
[01:37.17]And there's a dispenser here.
[01:38.33]I can make this even worse for this guy.
[01:47.32]You thought you killed me.
[02:02.01]What even just happened?
[02:03.45]Did I get backstabbed and then headshot immediately?
[02:07.93]Or did I get double like headshot by like two or three different snipers?
[02:11.38]I have no idea what just happened.
[02:17.60]You know, you gotta mourn for these two gentlemen.
[02:20.84]Two fort snipers.
[02:22.27]You gotta mourn for them.
[02:25.53]Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the com- Wait, no, that's wedding.
[02:30.61]That's a wedding ceremony.
[02:31.65]I'm supposed to be doing, like, a funeral.
[02:32.93]Well, that- I fucked up that joke.
[02:34.37]Let's keep going.
[02:37.15]They have a sentry in our intel?
[02:39.63]Are you serious right now?
[02:41.05]Hold on, I gotta check this out.
[02:44.44]How did they get this down here?
[02:48.86]Wha- Who let this happen?
[02:51.48]There's a sentry in our intel!
[02:55.99]How did this happen?
[02:58.75]Is there an engineer?
[03:00.01]There's a teleporter down here, too?
[03:04.23]You gotta be shitting me.
[03:05.29]Alright.
[03:05.81]See, that's going down.
[03:06.99]I ain't letting this guy get away with that.
[03:12.40]Sniper, it's a good job, mate.
[03:13.24]Sniper, it's a good job, mate.
[03:13.94]Sniper, it's a good job, mate.
[03:16.54]Get those direct shots.
[03:19.06]What's up?
[03:19.56]I'll take the intel, baby.
[03:23.40]Oh, uh...
[03:25.44]Right.
[03:26.60]I'm on the blue team.
[03:28.50]The blue team doesn't pick up the blue intelligence.
[03:33.86]Sometimes I wonder.
[03:38.45]It's going on.
[03:39.11]We're just gonna go harass the hell out of these snipers over here.
[03:43.59]We're gonna get a bunch of Zatoichi kills.
[03:50.35]Good evening.
[03:50.95]My name is Jerma.
[03:51.86]I suck so bad.
[03:53.74]It's okay.
[03:55.24]I... What is there a... Why is there a sentry there?
[04:02.34]Here we go.
[04:06.94]See ya!
[04:09.61]That can be only one.
[04:14.61]How did I get covered in Jurati?
[04:16.25]That's what I want to know.
[04:19.67]No, I forgot!
[04:21.01]I already forgot that that sentry gun was there.
[04:25.15]God damn.
[04:29.61]Eight, six, seven, eight.
[04:32.87]I look at where I am.
[04:33.35]I made it on top of this thing.
[04:38.05]Look at how cool it is.
[04:51.96]If that guy headshot me, right?
[04:53.82]If I fucking forget about this sentry one more time, I swear to God, I'm gonna flip out.
[05:00.99]There's nothing here.
[05:01.61]There's a sentry right there.
[05:03.29]You don't have to protect this.
[05:05.91]I didn't sh- How did I not- Did I hit the damn sentry?
[05:09.23]That was stupid.
[05:13.51]That was so stupid.
[05:14.85]I think it just gave me diarrhea, and that wasn't a headshot either.
[05:20.00]I will get this guy.
[05:24.54]Can't see.
[05:25.98]I can't see.
[05:29.66]Don't you guys know how two foot works?
[05:32.55]You can't just, like, walk in a straight line on the balcony.
[05:36.53]Dude, that's not how it works.
[05:39.01]Look at, what if these people are getting destroyed?
[05:41.27]I'm going to prove to you guys why that's a bad idea.
[05:46.50]You ready?
[05:46.84]Like, watch.
[05:47.48]See?
[05:48.20]Do people not understand?
[05:49.02]Just watch.
[05:50.16]Oh hi, I'm gonna walk this way on the two-foot map.
[05:59.59]What do these do?
[06:00.31]Alright, before I go, I'm ending the video.
[06:07.80]Teleporter exit.
[06:09.38]Okay, cool.
[06:10.68]That makes sense.
[06:12.04]Teleporter exit.
[06:13.78]Where are these entrances?
[06:15.64]Are they down here?
[06:17.77]Why?
[06:18.49]You're gonna have to walk anyways.
[06:21.37]If you go through that teleporter, you're gonna have to walk at least some of the... I don't understand.
[06:27.37]Somebody explain it to me.
[06:30.79]They don't even go down here!
[06:32.63]Where do those teleporters go?
[06:41.58]Alright, so let's go ahead and go over my loadout before the video starts.
[06:44.22]We got the Grenade Launcher, the Sticky Bomb Launcher, the, uh, Half-Set Aichi, the Unusuals Gun, the That's My Patch, and the Moomish Smites.
