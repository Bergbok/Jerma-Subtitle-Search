[01:12.77]Alright.
[01:14.64]Now you can hear me.
[01:16.12]And the audio sucks.
[01:17.44]And it's always going to suck on Jerma985's YouTube channel and his Twitch channel because he's too much of a fucking idiot to purchase a boom mic that could just hang down here off camera.
[01:28.99]Instead, he brought his goddamn desktop microphone all the fucking way, all the way over here.
[01:34.17]But it's probably better than it was last time.
[01:36.35]If it's not, then look at me because I can't fucking do anything about it.
[01:41.75]Let me know, what do you think?
[01:48.76]You look like a wax figurine.
[01:50.24]This looks like, wait, this looks like, alright, I can't like test this.
[01:58.73]Okay, you know when like, in like Looney Tunes, when like Bugs Bunny plays fucking tennis with himself?
[02:05.49]That's what I feel like I'm doing right now.
[02:07.52]Like, I'm like, hey, can you hear me?
[02:19.73]How's your back feeling?
[02:20.63]It's alright.
[02:21.17]I've been stretching.
[02:24.13]What do you mean it's blurry?
[02:28.33]Blurry?
[02:32.78]What?
[02:35.98]It's not blurry.
[02:38.00]I can see it over there.
[02:39.74]Blurry?
[02:43.82]What?
[02:50.20]Is it actually blurry?
[02:56.38]Wait a minute.
[02:58.81]What?
[03:01.49]Are you guys fucking with me?
[03:22.39]No, that just made it darker.
[03:27.57]It shouldn't be blurry.
[03:33.77]It's low resolution.
[03:35.21]What?
[03:35.59]Am I streaming this in the wrong resolution?
[03:40.20]Hold on.
[03:44.12]No, it shouldn't be.
[03:58.00]Hold on a second.
[04:06.75]What the fuck?
[04:16.29]There's something wrong with this goddamn camera.
[04:31.64]Ah, fucking computers.
[04:35.59]Computers suck.
[04:36.29]Don't even buy one.
[04:39.05]Wait, why is this?
[04:39.89]It's like broken.
[04:41.13]Can you even see?
[04:51.08]What the fuck is going on right now?
[05:05.33]Hey, can you hear me?
[05:09.31]My OBS just crashed.
[07:21.76]Hi.
[07:25.20]My name's Jerma985.
[07:29.00]I just spent two hours trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with my computer.
[07:49.38]He was crying.
[07:59.50]I have no idea what's going on.
[08:07.91]That's the honest to God truth.
[08:14.17]It looks like a deep fake.
[08:21.35]Looks like PS3 graphics.
[08:23.40]Let me just, let me open up my device.
[08:25.08]Oh, I didn't look at it because, hold on, what if I do this?
[08:46.81]Hey, you got something on your face.
[09:09.55]Alright, I wiped it off.
[09:12.15]Any better?
[09:12.53]I just like wiped it.
[09:16.42]I wiped it off.
[09:22.52]Can you see?
[09:23.04]It looks worse.
[09:33.96]It's too sharp.
[09:35.02]Alright, here's the thing that makes no fucking sense.
[09:38.28]I'm gonna level with me here.
[09:40.41]This is the same camera, this is the same computer, this is the same place less than 24 hours ago.
[09:51.13]What the fuck happened?
[09:52.73]It doesn't make any sense if it looks that weird.
[10:09.01]Let's try this.
[10:09.39]Give me one sec.
[10:12.61]We're going to troubleshoot this together because I got news for you.
[10:18.15]I paid for this fucking spot and I'm going to use it.
[10:29.23]What if I do this?
[10:54.03]Hold on.
[10:59.77]Alright, I get it.
[11:00.33]You guys are over here.
[11:04.39]Hit the camera.
[11:08.82]You can see the refresh rate.
[11:09.92]Yeah, I think there's something wrong with my actual fucking computer.
[11:13.84]Dude.
[11:15.44]Dude, 60 hertz.
[11:17.80]60 hertz refresh rate.
[11:28.14]Like, why can you see that?
[11:32.94]That don't make no fucking sense.
[11:39.21]And I'm looking at the preview right now.
[11:41.61]Right now I'm looking at the preview in OBS.
[11:45.03]It's perfect.
[11:46.41]This shit is perfect on OBS.
[11:48.93]What the heck is happening here?
[11:51.30]It's perfect on OBS.
[12:09.25]30 FPS.
[12:12.31]Does anyone remember, those of you that were here the last time we did this, I streamed it in 60 to make sure we'd get the fast fucking movements, right?
[12:24.64]I didn't stream it in 30 last time.
[12:26.34]I shouldn't have to do that.
[12:36.53]I did 30?
[12:39.90]It was 30.
[12:40.14]What?
[12:41.14]What do you mean it was 30?
[12:48.65]It was 30?
[12:50.79]Don't fuck with me here.
[12:55.87]It was 1080p 30.
[12:56.65]Wait, hold on.
[13:07.45]I gotta get to my computer.
[13:08.33]I gotta get to my computer.
[13:10.10]Hold on a second, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:11.90]Are you serious?
[13:12.58]I gotta get to my computer.
[13:20.79]What are you guys thinking?
[13:28.09]Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[13:44.68]How is he blurry and HD?
[13:46.28]I don't understand.
[13:49.28]Alright.
[13:53.54]Here's what I'm going to do.
[13:55.22]We'll try this.
[13:57.03]I feel like I'm getting deja vu right now.
[14:01.85]Did I do this exact same thing and go, oh, this looks like shit?
[14:05.77]And then if we did it in 1080 and 30, am I fucking going crazy?
[14:13.37]This happened the last time.
[14:16.34]Is that what you're telling me?
[14:17.14]We're just in a twilight zone.
[14:31.16]I'll be right back.
