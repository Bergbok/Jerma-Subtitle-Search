[00:15.04]I'd like to buy some land, the man says.
[00:18.36]How much would it be?
[00:19.78]Five million gold coins, you reply.
[00:22.04]You hand over the money and the man takes his leave.
[00:24.40]What?
[00:25.16]No, he hands me.
[00:26.42]He hands me the money.
[00:28.53]You look around and think about how lucky you are to have found such an amazing place.
[00:31.61]Am I on drugs?
[00:32.81]You run after the man as fast as you can.
[00:34.87]As soon as you catch up to him, you punch him in the face.
[00:38.34]He falls backward and hits his head on the ground.
[00:40.94]You grab his arm and pull him back up.
[00:42.94]He grabs your wrist and punches you in the face again.
[00:45.90]You dropkick the man in the face.
[00:47.41]He screams and drops his weapon.
[00:49.03]You laugh and continue running.
[00:53.79]Elbow drop the man from the top of the house.
[00:58.13]You throw the man off the roof of the house.
[01:00.93]He lands hard on the ground.
[01:02.67]You throw the man down a well.
[01:04.89]He struggles to climb out and manages to crawl out.
[01:07.97]You throw him down another well and he crawls out.
[01:12.27]You push him back in and watch as he tries to escape yet again.
[01:17.44]Finally, you throw him into a pit full of maggots.
[01:20.90]He is eaten alive.
[01:26.11]Go in the house.
[01:27.21]Go in the wooden house.
[01:31.70]You enter the wooden house.
[01:33.26]Inside you find a woman who looks very old.
[01:36.46]She smiles and she sees you.
[01:38.94]She introduces herself as Elena and thanks you for saving her life.
[01:43.05]Tell her to leave.
[01:44.73]To my house now.
[01:47.25]She refuses to leave and begins to curse you.
[01:49.91]She calls you a liar and a thief.
[01:52.11]She pulls out a knife and points it at you.
[01:55.66]You pull out a pistol and shoot her in the chest.
[02:00.37]She falls dead.
[02:01.97]You don't know why you did it, but you feel horrible about it.
[02:08.93]You search the woman and find a letter in her pocket.
[02:11.51]It reads, Dear friend, I'm sorry for-
[02:24.30]Dear friend, I'm sorry for calling you a liar and a thief, but I'm afraid those words fit you perfectly.
[02:31.22]I've seen you steal from me many times and I never caught you, and I will keep doing everything in my power to prevent you from ever being able to live in this world again.
[02:51.46]If you wish to change your fate, you must do it yourself.
[02:55.92]Go to the nearest for- Go- Go to the nearest for- Ow!
[03:16.13]Why?
[03:20.21]Go to the nearest forest and kill all the animals.
[03:24.43]Then gather their meat and bones and burn them.
[03:28.67]Okay, goddammit, that's so fucking stupid.
[03:33.14]What a sick fuck.
