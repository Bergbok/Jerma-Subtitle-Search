[00:03.46]It's a beautiful day today.
[00:04.55]Did you see the sun?
[00:06.43]I can't see the sun because of my cameras facing the stairs.
[00:09.73]Oh, well, you know, sitting on this staircase with you makes me just remember the days when I was younger.
[00:15.48]There was all kinds of fun things we used to do.
[00:18.56]I used to come to the...
[00:30.51]head Jerma this is what you used to do in old days well I didn't think we would ever be in outer space together just floating around I don't know what to say this is too dumb whoa where we going I kind of want to deserve
[00:56.38]I want to see what happens when I try to get out.
[00:58.95]What?
[01:02.85]This is so awkward looking.
[01:05.82]Good thing I'm like riding you.
[01:07.00]This is just a piggyback.
[01:28.04]No, get out of my way!
[01:28.92]It's my friend!
[01:33.64]No, I want to get in!
[01:35.10]No, I'm in.
[01:36.00]I can't.
[01:36.22]I have to drive it.
[01:44.13]These guys are too dangerous, yet again.
[01:45.79]No, we don't want you to drive the car.
[01:50.69]You die.
[01:57.40]It's going too fast.
[01:59.08]You're going to make me sick.
[02:01.08]We're going to the water.
[02:08.73]This is so stupid.
[02:09.53]I'm going to hit my head.
[02:23.53]If that was real, the person's head would have disintegrated.
[02:28.50]Okay, here we go.
[02:36.48]Here we go, we're doing a revert ramp.
[02:39.16]Oh yeah, Tony Hawk's pro skater.
[02:41.94]Except with bikes.
[02:43.22]So completely different.
[02:45.06]Damn, that was sick.
[02:47.10]200 points.
[02:48.96]300 points.
[02:49.92]You are a rock star!
[02:53.64]150 points.
[02:54.60]You're... How many points, Jerma?
[03:00.84]Didn't kill me.
[03:01.64]Oh, look at the two ostriches in their natural habitat.
[03:11.62]I want someone to walk by and see us like this.
[03:15.04]And just be like, what the fuck is going on here?
[03:22.58]Oh, get in the car.
[03:23.24]Hey, what about these, like, dolls that are just standing upright?
[03:25.81]This, like, larch-looking son of a bitch is still standing here.
[03:48.44]Look at this person.
[03:49.87]She has just moved.
[03:54.02]Look at her, look at the way she's holding the gun, look at her like shoulders.
[03:57.12]She's like hunched over, just doesn't care.
[03:59.12]I thought she instantly died.
[04:07.61]She had enough.
[04:18.57]She had enough.
[04:21.19]I'm not sure what's happening.
[04:27.12]Oh, this is so stupid.
[04:28.28]Can we move on from this?
[04:30.50]What?
[04:31.20]Why?
[04:32.30]Why did that happen?
[04:34.62]Why is it not letting us go over this?
[04:39.30]I... What is it?
[04:42.88]What the...
[04:52.04]Why are you dead?
[04:55.79]I don't know.
[05:02.56]Apparently, if you like stub your toe, you just die.
[05:05.64]You know, I think I was dead in midair and it just didn't say I was dead until I left.
[05:21.85]I don't have any words for this.
[05:33.82]Alright, did you see how we were just like jello jiggling down that stick?
[05:39.18]No, I just instantly died and was gone.
[05:42.68]Alright, that was jello.
[05:44.28]We were just jello sliding around in somebody's cup.
[05:48.89]Do you eat jello out of a cup?
[05:50.95]Yeah, you can.
[05:51.83]I mean, you can, but would you?
[05:55.04]Don't hit me over here.
[05:56.76]You'll never get me.
[06:04.30]What?
[06:05.98]I got you.
[06:08.40]How did this even happen?
[06:09.58]No, the tire!
[06:15.28]Something tells me that's not gonna work.
[06:24.06]You're gonna crash your game.
[06:28.70]You just wait until one of them spawns up there.
[06:37.22]The balance!
[06:38.29]I could not replicate that if I tried.
[06:47.38]I just love how you keep ditching different cars and trying other things.
[06:51.88]Okay, I got it this time.
[06:52.93]For some reason, I don't have hydraulics.
[06:55.27]But I'm putting the hydraulics on.
[06:57.99]God damn it, that doesn't work.
[06:59.09]Ditch it.
[07:01.79]Try the helicopter.
[07:02.59]No, let's try 14 garbage trucks.
[07:07.69]Come on, do the thing I know you're gonna do it.
[07:12.95]Get away from me.
[07:14.33]No!
[07:14.59]No!
[07:16.19]No!
[07:16.33]Get me up.
[07:37.70]You made a staircase of garbage trucks.
[07:42.15]You wanna do some platforming?
