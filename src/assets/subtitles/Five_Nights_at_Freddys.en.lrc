[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.33]Play FNAF.
[00:07.49]Okay.
[00:09.25]Which one?
[00:14.12]Which one?
[00:16.10]Okay, what do I have?
[00:16.92]I have... I have Five Nights at Freddy's and Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[00:23.89]Five Nights at Freddy's 1?
[00:25.13]Oh my god.
[00:26.71]You're trying to get me fucking... Five Nights at Freddy's 1?
[00:32.67]Alright, let's make a prediction here.
[00:34.79]I don't think I'm going to get past the first knight or the second knight.
[00:39.13]Two?
[00:40.05]Two is better.
[00:44.77]I'll do one.
[00:46.97]I'll do one.
[00:47.40]Alright, let's go.
[00:52.36]I bet you I don't even make it past the first knight.
[00:55.58]You know how I play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[00:57.64]I close both doors, have both lights on, and I go like this.
[01:02.90]Cover my eyes, cover my ears.
[01:05.50]Like this.
[01:08.62]And just wait.
[01:13.64]Alright, let's play Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[01:19.16]Whatever.
[01:21.30]This is gonna be loud, isn't it?
[01:22.25]Holy fuck, hold on.
[01:27.55]What the fuck?
[01:30.83]Does this even have graphic options?
[01:35.56]No, there's no graphics options in Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[01:37.90]Let's see.
[01:51.78]Is it too loud?
[01:56.59]I can't even tell if it's being captured.
[02:00.13]There we go.
[02:00.59]Alright, here we go.
[02:04.09]Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[02:10.71]What the fuck is happening?
[02:16.93]Okay, I told you I'm not full of shit.
[02:20.35]This is a Steam cloud save file.
[02:23.88]I didn't get past the first night.
[02:25.56]You thought I was full of shit?
[02:27.96]You thought I was making that up?
[02:35.88]Here we go.
[02:36.42]Hello, hello, hello.
[02:48.32]Oh, look out!
[02:48.76]It's Chickie and Foxy and Freddy!
[03:02.59]Hello?
[03:03.65]Hello?
[03:05.95]I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night.
[03:12.92]No, hold on.
[03:13.42]I gotta do it the right way.
[03:14.78]It's this.
[03:16.52]Not like this.
[03:18.64]My brother taught me this when we were younger.
[03:22.26]We went to go see the Alien ride at Disney World.
[03:25.58]It was the thing that used to be the Lilo and Stitch ride.
[03:29.55]And it was terrifying.
[03:30.69]And he's like, dude, is that what you do?
[03:31.91]You go like this, cover with your pinkies and your eyes and block your ears with your thumbs.
[03:34.81]And you're going to be fine.
[03:39.97]Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a magical place for kids and grown-ups alike where fantasy and fun come to life.
[03:48.25]Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person.
[03:52.84]Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days or as soon as property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned.
[04:01.10]Did I make it?
[04:01.62]How much battery do I have?
[04:28.22]I haven't pressed a single button.
[04:30.56]No, I told you.
[04:31.40]Look it.
[04:31.64]They ain't getting in.
[04:33.54]Not on night one.
[04:35.37]Open the doors.
[04:36.95]No!
[04:45.51]They used to be allowed to walk around during the day too, but then there was the fight of 87.
[04:50.79]Yeah.
[04:53.66]It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know.
[04:58.26]Now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, if they happen to see you after
[05:11.07]I don't like having the doors open.
[05:13.41]I hate this game.
[05:14.17]How did I not get past Night 1?
[05:15.89]Isn't that impossible?
[05:17.68]It's actually impossible.
[05:19.06]Why did I not do it?
[05:38.45]You must have been zonked.
[05:39.63]Why do you treat all video games like a joke?
[05:41.45]I just beat Cuphead's DLC in like an hour and 12 minutes.
[05:45.21]I'm sorry.
[05:46.11]Come on, Quint.
[05:47.07]Alright, goodnight.
[06:23.60]I'm good.
[06:31.44]I'm gonna lose because I wasted all the power?
[06:37.88]They don't even leave on the first night.
[06:43.17]They actually don't even leave on the first night.
[06:46.13]I think Freddy leaves and goes into one other room.
[06:51.11]Click Freddy's nose in the poster.
[06:59.92]Yeah, so then that nobody moves until at like 3 or 4 a.m.
[07:03.27]I think Freddy disappears What's that sound what is that sound what's that sound what's that sound Did I spawn like a monster or something?
[07:24.08]I'm serious.
[07:24.60]I don't I don't know what that fucking sound is.
[07:30.27]What did I do?
[07:31.67]You made me spawn something.
[07:32.87]I've never pressed Freddy's fucking nose before.
[08:40.60]Oh shit!
[08:41.30]They actually do come out!
[08:43.74]I'm gonna die!
[08:44.32]I just hit escape!
[09:08.83]I'm sorry.
[09:10.15]I didn't know that.
[09:11.19]Why would it just quit the game?
[09:17.77]God damn it.
[09:18.25]I'm sorry.
[09:19.18]I fucked up.
[09:20.80]Can you guys see it?
[09:21.36]Alright, I'm not going to fuck it up.
[09:25.00]Alright, alright, alright.
[09:27.96]I can't see chat either.
[09:30.00]Is the recent movie good?
[09:33.17]Why did it quit?
[09:34.03]Stop quitting.
[09:37.79]Alright, can you see?
[09:38.53]Hello?
[09:47.85]Hold on a second.
[09:51.61]Let me just make a few adjustments to my Herman Miller M-Body chair.
[10:04.45]Oh, yeah.
[10:04.89]That's it right there.
[10:23.83]Refund this game.
[10:26.21]Guys, I bought this game nine years ago.
[10:30.91]I don't think the refund... I think I'm out of the seven-day window.
[10:37.72]Refund the bet.
[10:38.78]Oh.
[10:39.48]What are you talking about?
[10:45.08]They would understand.
[10:50.93]Can you imagine trying to refund a game that you bought 10 years ago?
[10:55.68]I mean, I technically only have an hour and 20 minutes in it.
[10:58.78]I mean... I didn't really like it that much.
[11:03.56]I didn't really get to it.
[11:06.18]Other games kind of took over there.
[11:10.04]It's actually 14 days, yeah.
[11:17.43]Ugh.
[11:21.43]Don't play this game, I'm scared.
[11:22.61]Alright, have they moved yet?
[11:26.85]No.
[11:37.22]Oh, I'm running over a thing.
[11:42.14]Pog, 87 power, left, yep.
[11:46.02]What the fuck is going on there?
[11:47.35]What was that?
[11:47.89]What happened?
[11:48.29]Excuse me?
[11:50.76]What are you talking about?
[11:51.46]Excuse me?
[11:52.76]Why did that happen?
[11:55.32]I've never seen that before.
[11:58.35]Alright.
[11:59.71]No more fucking around.
[12:06.43]Why did I do that?
[12:06.91]I don't know.
[12:07.25]I just spawned something.
[12:20.66]What does that actually do?
[12:44.13]What does that actually do?
[12:57.05]Hello.
[13:13.41]Wait, hold on.
[13:13.73]Let me see if I can get it.
[13:21.17]That was close.
[13:22.67]Give me an Oscar.
[13:27.15]No, no, no, no.
[13:27.73]It's wrong.
[13:28.11]I had it wrong.
[13:28.53]It's like... Got it.
[13:31.67]Oh, dude.
[13:42.56]This is probably where that fucking Foxy comes out of there.
[13:46.16]I heard this.
[13:46.76]My fucking son played this one.
[13:48.66]Fucking Foxy comes out of there and sprints down the fucking hallway.
[13:50.78]Dude, it's fucked up.
[13:58.39]Nah, I never played this before.
[13:59.85]I don't know.
[14:10.76]Don't look at Foxy.
[14:11.56]Why?
[14:13.66]Oh, shit.
[14:14.14]Somebody fucking moved.
[14:18.42]They walk down halls and stuff.
[14:19.52]They fucking walk down the hall.
[14:21.33]I played it before.
[14:21.99]I know it.
[14:22.55]Wait.
[14:23.99]Oh, shit.
[14:24.75]There it is.
[14:27.97]Okay.
[14:28.39]I'll fucking drop this guy if he fucking comes in my... If he comes over to the door, I'm gonna fucking drop him.
[15:54.36]Ain't nobody gettin' in here now!
[16:09.63]That was too soon?
[16:10.37]I don't think it was.
[16:49.33]Oh, shit!
[17:09.60]Get out of here!
[17:14.08]What happened?
[17:14.78]What?
[17:15.04]Close the door!
[17:15.58]Close the door!
[17:16.08]Close the door!
[17:16.56]Okay, I'm good.
[17:17.78]Six AM coming.
[17:41.27]Oh no!
[17:41.99]What are you gonna do?
[17:43.07]Bulletproof glass.
[17:44.37]Bulletproof glass.
[17:45.72]You ain't getting in.
[17:46.50]Bulletproof glass.
[17:48.44]Who's over here?
[17:49.84]Oh no!
[17:50.98]Bulletproof glass.
[18:33.64]Oh, I missed it.
[18:36.68]I'm fucking good.
[18:38.45]I'm fucking good.
[18:41.43]No, we're good.
[18:43.83]Alright, night two.
[18:46.27]This is where it gets a little crazy.
[18:55.49]This is where it gets crazy.
[18:59.84]I'm not touching anything until at least 2 a.m.
[19:29.48]Just get out of the chair and leave?
[19:34.25]Funny idea.
[19:37.45]What if I just pretended to fall asleep on stream?
[19:41.42]Alright, I'm gonna pretend to fall asleep on stream.
[19:44.36]I'm gonna put a text on the bottom that says, like, dude, wicked fucking tired.
[19:47.66]Like, had a long day.
[19:51.82]And then get woken up by the jump scare.
[19:57.48]You guys would be like, wake up, dude!
[19:59.00]Wake the fuck up!
[19:59.66]Wait, what do I have to do?
[20:00.43]Do I have to do a light?
[20:02.15]How do I stop that from happening?
[20:06.72]How do I stop that from happening?
[20:15.81]How do I stop that from happening?
[20:23.51]Where is this motherfucker?
[20:24.37]Uh-oh.
[20:30.84]Uh-oh.
[20:33.98]Where are you?
[20:35.95]Oh!
[20:42.99]Oh!
[20:56.28]Okay.
[20:58.34]We'll do it on night three.
[21:14.76]Oh, the door's open.
[21:43.88]Lights?
[21:45.64]Why?
[21:45.94]That's extra power.
[22:32.97]I haven't moved.
[22:53.94]When's it gonna be 3 a.m.? ?
[23:09.52]Dude, it's been 2 a.m.
[23:10.64]for an hour.
[23:24.18]Oh, shit.
[23:24.96]Oh, where are you going?
[23:25.56]Alright, you went that way.
[23:36.31]You're here.
[23:37.13]Alright.
[23:37.69]What happened?
[23:56.94]I have to keep looking at Foxy, right?
[23:58.47]Uh-oh.
[24:51.28]What the fuck?
[24:52.62]What happened?
[24:53.18]What happened?
[24:53.60]Is that bad?
[24:54.88]Is that bad?
[24:55.32]Am I okay?
[24:57.20]Am I actually- Am I okay?
[24:58.75]Am I go- Am I okay?
[25:02.85]Am I alright?
[25:05.71]Why is that happening?
[25:13.62]Am I alright?
[25:17.56]What does that mean?
[25:28.11]the goddamn game.
[25:28.87]I exited the fucking game.
[25:30.14]No, I didn't.
[25:30.60]I'm still in.
[25:37.84]Close the door!
[25:38.62]Alright, I'm good.
[25:47.10]Is he still there?
[25:51.15]What the fuck are you still doing here, you dick?
[26:24.30]What the fuck is happening?
[26:39.06]I don't get it.
[26:39.64]I don't get it.
[26:43.34]I actually don't get it.
[26:45.52]Guys, I've played Five Nights at Freddy's for a shitty YouTube video one time.
[26:52.95]And I wasn't even paying attention to the game.
[26:54.43]Alright, hold on.
[26:57.13]We're doing this, though.
[26:57.91]Alright, what should I say?
[27:12.34]Like, really tired today.
[27:17.00]not like long day just chilling with the stream whatever right let's do okay and the cam is gonna be huge too
[27:51.30]I gotta look realistic.
[27:59.09]Why would you fucking play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[28:01.87]Oh, yeah, I'll turn the lights off.
[28:18.60]Okay, hold on.
[28:35.01]Just like... Is that alright?
[28:45.05]Should it be a little brighter?
[28:52.08]Hold on.
[28:52.94]Yeah, put the death counter on too?
[28:55.26]So people think it's automatic, right?
[29:00.32]People think it's automatically counting the amount of times I die in Five Nights at Freddy's?
[29:05.21]I've had 600 fucking dives.
[29:59.30]okay here we go make it 15 that's way too many maybe like 30 or like 60 or something right 600 means I've been here for a long time 62 right all right that's fine all right can we get some gonna how about this
[30:27.71]Alright, that looks good.
[30:29.21]Let's go.
[30:29.49]This is going to be fucking stupid.
[30:38.61]Can you guys see it?
[30:39.11]You guys can see it, right?
[30:41.95]Okay.
[30:42.11]Here we go.
[30:59.21]Why would you do this?
[31:08.76]Hello?
[31:09.48]Hello?
[31:26.86]Ha ha ha!
[31:27.38]Ha ha ha!
[31:55.23]That's one more reason not to run out of power, right?
[31:58.37]I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights.
[32:02.79]There are blind spots in your camera view, and those blind spots happen to be right outside your doors.
[32:09.89]So if you can't find something or someone on your cameras, be sure to check the door light.
[32:16.59]You might only have a few seconds to react.
[32:19.21]Not that you would be in any danger, of course.
[32:23.29]I'm not implying that.
[32:25.97]Also, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time.
[32:30.49]The character in there seems unique in that he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time.
[32:37.76]I guess he doesn't like being watched.
[32:39.30]I don't know.
[32:40.84]Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control.
[32:43.46]Talk to you soon!
[33:21.90]Fuck!
[33:23.38]No!
[33:24.02]I was so close!
[33:27.93]Reset!
[33:28.45]Reset!
[33:28.81]We gotta reset!
[33:29.43]We gotta reset!
[33:30.01]We gotta reset!
[33:32.93]Reset!
[33:33.35]Reset!
[33:33.71]Reset!
[33:34.03]Reset!
[33:34.33]Reset!
[33:34.73]I just... Fuck!
[33:38.17]You don't know how hard it is to do that.
[33:40.51]To sit here and know that there's like 20,000 people all spamming wake up and shit.
[33:45.89]And I'm some dumbass that's turned... Why do I have an auto redoing Five Nights at Freddy's death counter?
[33:53.47]And why am I sleeping to this?
[33:55.01]It's too much.
[33:56.69]It's too much.
[33:57.25]My brain can't do... Alright, I'm gonna go.
[33:58.41]Here we go.
[34:03.11]It's so hard.
[34:03.95]The bottom text is covered by the game?
[34:12.85]Alright, shh.
[34:13.31]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[34:14.27]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[34:15.77]Alright, let's go.
[34:17.39]I won't fuck it up this time.
[34:18.59]I swear to God.
[34:41.50]Oh my god, it's so stupid.
[35:00.68]One more try, I swear to god.
[35:02.64]I swear, I'll get it.
[35:03.42]I'm so, it's so hard, it's so hard, you have no idea.
[35:10.50]Again, again, I promise I'll get it this time.
[35:11.98]I promise.
[35:15.69]I promise.
[35:16.25]I swear to God I'll get it right now.
[35:17.33]Alright, everybody shut up.
[35:19.13]Go.
[35:19.91]And begin.
[35:39.58]Dude, it's the fucking telephone.
[35:42.02]It's the telephone.
[35:43.82]It's the stupid telephone that keeps... It's like the phone's ringing in the house and I'm sleeping.
[35:51.76]Someone's trying to reach me so bad.
[35:53.65]It's just like, holy shit, dude.
[35:58.85]You're on stream.
[35:59.75]Get up.
[36:00.33]Wake up, dude.
[36:00.95]Turn your stream off.
[36:01.71]Call his fucking landline.
[36:10.54]Dude, I wouldn't call your landline at 10 o'clock, but seriously, man.
[36:16.61]Alright, here we go.
[36:18.43]I gotta get this.
[36:19.27]I have to.
[36:21.99]I have to get this.
[36:24.11]I will do whatever it fucking takes.
[36:28.19]It's just the fucking phone ringing.
[36:30.61]Just sitting there.
[36:34.27]Okay.
[36:41.09]Dude, wake up.
[36:42.15]I'm calling your house.
[36:44.92]Okay, come on.
[37:09.12]I'm gonna go crazy.
[37:11.66]God damn it.
[37:12.46]All right, I got it.
[37:13.20]Hold on.
[37:14.96]Fucking hell.
[37:20.70]Okay.
[37:23.17]I don't know if I can do it.
[37:24.77]I really don't think I can do it.
[37:28.27]It's too dumb.
[37:31.73]This is stupid, right?
[37:33.03]This is really dumb.
[37:35.37]All right, I think I got it out of my system.
[37:36.71]I had to at this point.
[37:40.60]Okay, here we go.
[37:42.04]You know what?
[37:42.38]It's so loud.
[37:43.40]I just think of... Okay, I gotta get it out.
[37:45.36]I gotta get it out now.
[37:51.12]Okay.
[37:51.54]Because the whole thing is when the jump scare happens, I'm gonna fucking wake up and it's gonna be stupid.
[37:59.42]Alright, this is it.
[38:00.16]I got it.
[38:01.40]Fuck the phone.
[38:02.24]It's gonna be funny, but fucking don't listen to it.
[38:12.77]Fuck you.
[38:19.86]I can't mute the phone call.
[38:21.00]It's so funny.
[38:22.00]That's like the funniest part of this whole thing.
[38:25.03]Okay.
[38:26.71]All right.
[39:02.39]I gotta get it together.
[39:07.45]It's... After the phone, I'll be... It'll be good.
[39:11.32]I just have to get through the phone.
[39:14.78]Once the phone bit is over, I'll be good.
[39:16.70]It's just that phone part.
[39:20.94]For real.
[39:22.65]It's...
[39:46.80]Hello?
[39:47.64]Hello?
[39:49.56]Well, if you're hearing this and you made it today too, congrats!
[39:54.01]I won't talk quite as long this time since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses.
[40:01.55]It might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone's in their proper place, you know.
[40:08.43]Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come on stage very often.
[40:13.14]I've heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so hey, I guess that's one more reason not to run out of power, right?
[40:21.12]I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights.
[40:25.55]There are blind spots in your camera view, and those blind spots happen to be right outside your doors.
[40:32.63]So if you can't find something or someone on your cameras, be sure to check the door lights.
[40:40.22]you might only have a few seconds to react.
[40:43.46]Not that you would be in any danger, of course.
[40:45.90]I'm not implying that.
[40:48.71]Also, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time.
[40:53.45]The character in there seems unique in that he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time.
[41:00.50]I guess he doesn't like being watched.
[41:02.08]I don't know.
[41:03.58]Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control.
[41:06.22]Talk to you soon!
[42:24.30]Yeah.
[42:25.68]Yeah.
[42:28.83]Uh...
[42:57.39]We got it.
[43:07.35]Well, it's like there's a candle in my room.
[43:14.29]That was so hard to get to that third ring.
[43:22.98]What happened?
[43:25.80]That was a rare death screen?
[43:32.38]Alright, I don't care.
[43:33.12]I'm done.
[43:33.50]This room's over.
[43:34.92]That was fun.
[43:37.70]That was fun.
[43:38.02]Yeah, it looks like there's a candle in here.
[43:44.99]I think that's the one you go out on.
[43:49.43]It does look like it could fucking blurry, doesn't it?
[43:54.70]Okay.
[43:57.20]Alright, guys.
[43:57.72]That's it.
[43:59.90]I'll see you guys on...
[44:06.21]There's a lot of shit going on.
[44:08.51]And I have to tell you.
[44:12.49]Really, really... Alright, I really don't want to say this, but it sucks.
[44:16.01]But just in case.
[44:18.45]Baseball might need to move again.
[44:22.92]Not far.
[44:23.86]Not far.
[44:25.06]But might need to move another few days.
[44:29.06]It would work our asses off to make sure that we can get what we need.
[44:35.16]But it's happening within the next, like, 30 days, okay?
[44:42.01]I know I keep changing it, but we just keep having things that have to change and keep having venue things that have to happen.
[44:46.71]And some venues need to change.
[44:48.05]And it's been a whole ordeal.
[44:50.57]We're working on it.
[44:51.63]So I might have to change it.
[44:52.65]By the way...
[44:54.52]green screen stuff you have until the 18th at 1201 midnight to get your submissions in go read the rules they're in the discord right now what's the green what's the green screen thing dude the green screen stream we did a bunch of shit in front of the green screen there's three full streams of it you can do whatever you want with some rules and go read those rules you're gonna need them delaying it to next year no no fucking way this is not happening
[45:25.31]All right, I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[45:27.69]Let's see.
[45:28.03]Maybe I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[45:30.31]Yeah, 24th of July.
[45:31.65]Probably going to do something.
[45:35.17]Holly and I might do something.
[45:36.19]So I'll see you guys on the 5th, Tuesday.
[45:42.63]I have no idea what we're going to do, but I'm sure we'll do something.
[45:47.16]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[45:48.08]See you later.
[45:49.06]Take care of yourselves.
[45:50.70]Well, we got a few minutes, so.
[46:01.16]We've got some time.
[46:06.26]Oh, you can do the mod day.
[46:07.50]Actually, what a great idea.
[46:09.42]Maybe I'll do that on Tuesday.
[46:11.86]Just get a bunch of mods for a few games and just have an absolute puke stream.
[46:16.58]I think that makes sense, right?
[46:26.18]Tuesday puke stream?
[46:28.95]I think it makes sense.
[46:36.47]Yeah.
[46:37.65]Uh, what was I going to say?
[46:38.97]Hold on.
[46:55.46]Elden ring.
[46:56.12]Yeah.
[46:56.58]Okay.
[46:57.00]I got a question.
[46:58.47]Does Elden ring have a bunch of mods?
[47:05.34]Are there fun things to do with Elden Ring with modding?
[47:08.95]Okay.
[47:10.07]Because I'm going to have to take a look.
[47:18.46]What happened with the Elden Ring PvP?
[47:20.88]Honestly, okay, so here's what happened with the Elden Ring PvP.
[47:23.71]So I talked to Ludwig and I'm like, oh, hey, maybe we can do it with this mod.
[47:26.77]And then Twitch Rivals just kind of started doing it.
[47:32.75]Not necessarily the community version, right?
[47:34.69]Maybe, no, they did, sort of.
[47:36.57]So I was like, oh, I guess the tournament stuff is already happening with Twitch Rivals.
[47:39.91]So I guess that's kind of what I was planning on doing, stuff like that anyways.
[47:48.87]So, they did like a PvP thing.
[47:54.84]You can't really use mods online.
[47:59.32]Yeah, I gotta be careful too, right?
[48:09.09]Also, Dark Souls 3 has a bunch of crazy shit too, doesn't it?
[48:13.31]That I never got to.
[48:14.19]I did the FPS mod.
[48:19.69]Did you ever revisit inscription?
[48:21.01]I did off stream.
[48:23.19]I got to the third act.
[48:26.51]Off stream.
[48:27.83]It's pretty crazy.
[48:31.16]I did not beat it though.
[48:40.76]What about the Outer Wilds DLC?
[48:42.22]I don't know, maybe.
[48:47.32]I heard the Art of Wilds DLC was kind of hard.
[48:51.69]It was very specific or something, right?
[48:59.51]Speaking of Ludwig, did you guys see the Mogul Money Live?
[49:04.10]God, that was fucking hilarious.
[49:09.30]Let me tell you, Ludwig really...
[49:14.60]He's got some chops on him.
[49:18.13]That was so funny.
[49:19.65]He did such an unbelievable fucking job.
[49:26.29]It's really awesome to see that whole crew doing that stuff.
[49:35.16]Yeah.
[49:38.06]He's very sociable.
[49:38.98]He's just so... He just has it.
[49:43.53]He just has it.
[49:43.97]Those of you who know what I'm talking about, he's just got it.
[49:47.23]He just has it.
[49:49.39]You know what I mean.
[49:58.98]Did you get your bidet yet?
[50:00.06]No.
[50:01.46]But then again, I never took a picture in a Mega Milk shirt, so where even?
[50:12.39]No, it was awesome.
[50:13.23]It was fun the whole way through.
[50:19.58]But yeah, I'll talk to you guys in a couple days.
[50:23.00]We'll do some mod stuff.
[50:24.64]And see you later.
[50:25.36]Thanks for watching.
[50:27.28]You bet your ass I'm going to get this to exactly six hours.
[50:30.30]Exactly.
[50:30.91]On the dot.
[50:34.87]There it is.
[50:36.01]Alright, goodnight.
[50:36.99]Call your mother.
[50:37.79]See you later.
[50:38.75]Take care of yourselves, guys.
[50:40.47]Have a great night.
