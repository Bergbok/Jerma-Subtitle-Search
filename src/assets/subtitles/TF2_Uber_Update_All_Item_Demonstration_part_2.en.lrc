[00:02.32]So here he is, the man of the hour, the medic.
[00:04.48]If you haven't seen Meet the Medic already, go see it right now.
[00:07.62]It's amazing.
[00:08.90]The new needle gun is the overdose.
[00:11.40]10% less damage done, but your movement speed increases based on the amount of ubercharge you have.
[00:17.23]The new medigun is the quick fix.
[00:20.19]Everyone already knew what this was.
[00:21.59]It was in beta, just like the detonator.
[00:24.21]Faster heal rate, faster ubercharge rate, but you can't overheal anybody.
[00:28.17]And your ubercharge is a 300% faster heal rate.
[00:31.15]and immunity to movement-impairing effects.
[00:33.47]And this thing, I had to buy this.
[00:35.85]It just lets you see enemy health.
[00:37.73]By the way, sets do absolutely nothing.
[00:39.97]As you can see, I have the full set of this.
[00:43.21]So, the quick fix is kind of an odd duck.
[00:46.75]I think it's weird because it takes everything you've known about the medic and it flips it upside down.
[00:51.80]See, right here I'm healing a bunch of people over and over again and running around trying to overheal people, but it's just kind of a habit that you have as a medic
[01:01.57]You have to lose that when you have the quick fix because you don't have to do this.
[01:05.37]The only reason why you do this in the beginning, of course, is to build up an Uber, but it's completely unnecessary in any other situation.
[01:13.21]I think the actual Uber charge on this thing, it's just kind of odd.
[01:17.25]It's trying to be like three or four different things, you know, with the knockback immunity, the extra heal rate, and I don't know, I just feel like it's trying to be too many things and
[01:27.53]If they just got rid of the uber completely and made it, instead of 40%, like 60% better heal, I bet you people would still use it and still love it.
[01:37.55]So speaking of the uber of this gun, why don't we take a look and see what it does.
[01:42.49]I actually kind of freak out here.
[01:43.68]I don't really do it so well.
[01:45.64]I get kind of lost in what I'm doing.
[01:47.98]I keep thinking it's going to be like an uber charge, but like I said, it's just not.
[01:52.59]The heal rate is great, though, as you can tell.
[01:54.31]I just popped it.
[01:55.01]It's hard to tell if you popped it or not.
[01:56.35]It looks kind of like the Amputator Taunt.
[01:59.85]And that was it.
[02:01.61]You just saw it.
[02:03.03]It was faster heal rate for 10 seconds.
[02:06.31]I don't know.
[02:08.93]The actual heal rate on this thing is amazing.
[02:11.38]As you can see, that Scout was at zero health, and I brought him all the way up to full in less than pretty much a second.
[02:18.17]So the actual heal rate is great.
[02:20.13]Like I said, the Uber is just nothing to me.
[02:22.49]I'm not a big fan of it.
[02:24.15]I probably have to give it some more time.
[02:25.73]That's probably the problem that I'm having.
[02:29.17]But... See right here, the Soldier just had no health, and now he's at full.
[02:34.11]It's just... It's an incredible... It's a good... I want to say raid healer, if anyone knows what I'm talking about when I say raid healer.
[02:41.49]That'll throw back to some, like, you know, World of Warcraft players, or some, you know, Lotro players, or whoever you are, but
[02:47.63]It's a raid-healing gun, let's put it that way.
[02:51.83]Where this thing actually excels is in situations like this, where you have to out-heal damage.
[02:58.51]See, this soldier probably would have just died right here if it wasn't for the quick fix.
[03:02.38]The Kritzkrieg and the regular medic gun would have definitely failed in that situation.
[03:07.60]So, the other items.
[03:09.88]First of all, I thought the new melee unlockable for the medic was a hat.
[03:15.03]And I was psyched about it.
[03:16.19]I was like, oh my god.
[03:18.41]That's an awesome, I hope that's a miscellaneous.
[03:20.49]That would be so funny.
[03:21.83]But it turns out it's a melee weapon.
[03:24.29]And with identical stats as the default bone saw.
[03:29.13]But you get to see players' health.
[03:31.41]Enemies' health.
[03:32.05]And that's a huge bonus.
[03:34.63]But I don't know if I'm willing to give up some of the other saws.
[03:37.27]Like the uber saw or the amputator.
[03:39.35]They're just so good.
[03:41.15]It's going to take a little more time using them to find that out.
[03:45.23]The sniper got a couple of items in this update.
[03:47.90]Most notably, the Bazaar Bargain, the new sniper rifle.
[03:52.26]Base charge rate is decreased by 20%.
[03:54.04]Each scoped headshot decreases the weapon's charge time by, I think, it's 10%.
[03:59.86]A scoped body shot or a missed shot wipes the charge.
[04:03.68]No new secondary for the sniper this time, but a new knife, the Sha-Sha-Ha-Sha-Sha-Sha-Sha-Sha, which essentially is just the equalizer without the speed increase.
[04:14.98]So this is what it looks like just at base level.
[04:17.61]I haven't shot anybody yet.
[04:19.35]And see, there's a little indicator on the lower right that says Heads.
[04:22.75]It's sort of like the Demoman's Eyelander or the Clytemnor.
[04:26.25]But here's one headshot here.
[04:28.30]And there's another one, I believe, right here.
[04:30.52]So this is what it looks like with two.
[04:32.46]And it looks pretty normal, maybe a little bit higher.
[04:35.14]It looks about the same as it would be with the regular sniper rifle.
[04:39.73]To consistently do well with this sniper rifle, you have to know what you're doing as a sniper.
[04:46.19]They came out with the Sydney Sleeper for the people that couldn't really aim too well.
[04:51.84]And then they came out with this, which was the pro sniper rifle.
[04:56.18]So, I'm a very bad sniper, so I think I only get a maximum, I think I get three.
[05:01.19]So, yeah, you can't really demonstrate this too well because I only get three headshots.
[05:08.05]So, we'll see what it looks like after three.
[05:10.51]I'm pretty sure the max is probably seven or eight.
[05:13.22]I wonder what the max is for the Islanders.
[05:16.84]So, as you can see, it is pretty much, right there it looks like it's the same as the Sydney Sleeper is.
[05:22.70]now after the buff.
[05:24.02]So I'm guessing after four or five headshots in a row, you will really start to see this thing shine.
[05:29.73]These are just a couple of kills with the new knife.
[05:32.47]The new knife, like I said, is the equalizer, which means that you do more damage when you take more damage.
[05:38.15]I think it's when you get to half health, you do like 25% more damage or something like that.
[05:43.42]And we end with the spy.
[05:45.20]The spy got two new items in this update.
[05:48.44]The first that he got is a new revolver.
[05:50.52]It's called the Enforcer.
[05:52.72]20% damage done over the regular revolver, and half a second increase in cloak time, which we'll talk about in a second.
[05:59.89]He got a new knife, the big earner, plus 30 cloak on kill.
[06:04.03]I'm not sure if that means backstab or not.
[06:06.19]And 25 less health on wear, so you have 100 health as the spy.
[06:10.77]So let's go over the enforcer.
[06:12.17]It is the new revolver.
[06:14.13]It is 20% more damage, and it is a straight upgrade.
[06:17.90]That's right, it's a straight upgrade to the regular revolver if you use the dead ringer.
[06:22.41]I say that because the Deadbringer is not affected by the decrease in cloak time.
[06:27.99]Only the regular invisibility watch and the cloak and dagger are affected by the decrease in cloak time.
[06:33.99]So let's talk about the knife now.
[06:36.41]Take a look at my cloak in the lower right and watch this.
[06:39.40]Bang.
[06:40.26]This knife is also another one of those straight upgrades over the original, mainly because the downside is really not that bad.
[06:50.39]you only are taking a 25 health hit.
[06:52.95]I mean, the kunai is a 65 health hit, so you're not losing that much health at all.
[06:58.76]So for the purposes of showing you the downside of the revolver, I'm going to use the irregular cloak.
[07:04.98]So you'll see here, I come out here and I get a kill.
[07:07.02]Watch my cloak bar.
[07:09.12]It's going to fill right up.
[07:10.94]And then watch this.
[07:12.61]That right there, that little half second right there is going to throw you off so bad.
[07:18.39]I highly recommend using the Dead Ringer with this set.
[07:21.65]Not really the knife, but definitely, definitely the revolver portion of the set.
[07:29.67]And that is all I have for you guys.
[07:31.47]I'm sorry that I had to split it up into two videos, but you don't know how horrible this was to make.
[07:38.81]It took a long time.
[07:40.13]I hope you guys appreciate it.
[07:41.41]I hope somebody gets something out of it because I did.
[07:45.64]I learned how to tear my hair out of my skull because item servers weren't working and oh my god.
[07:52.36]I don't even get me statted.
[07:55.04]But yeah.
[07:56.80]Like, comment, subscribe.
[07:58.10]Do whatever you guys want to do.
[07:59.82]I hope you guys enjoy the new items and I'm glad I could bring at least some information to somebody who is on the fence about something.
[08:06.87]So
[08:07.83]Thanks again.
[08:08.92]Take care, guys.
[08:10.03]I'll see you next time.
