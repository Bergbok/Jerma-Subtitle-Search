[00:07.38]Whoa, dude, you need to chill out.
[00:17.01]You gotta calm down and take your sand radar with you.
[00:22.97]From fucking Star Wars in the background.
[00:28.23]Let's go...
[00:30.95]What?!
[00:31.23]There's an evil pharaoh!
[00:35.69]What the hell is he doing?
[00:37.26]He's like, oh god, I can't see.
[00:40.92]Fuck you, dude.
[00:41.92]Come on, dude.
[00:42.90]Put that thing down.
[00:44.30]I'm just an evil pharaoh guy.
[00:45.58]I just want to swing the sword.
[00:46.90]God damn it.
[00:47.84]Would you just stop it, man?
[00:52.16]Where is he?
[00:52.62]Where are you?
[00:53.04]I know I'm gonna find you.
[00:53.88]When I find you, you're gonna die.
[00:55.58]I swear to God, dude.
[00:56.30]There you are!
[00:57.26]There you are!
[00:57.79]You thought you could get away from me?
[00:58.91]You thought you could escape the mummy?
[01:00.47]Aw, dude!
[01:00.91]Aw, come on, man!
[01:01.75]Aw, what the fuck?
[01:02.47]I can't see!
[01:03.75]Aw, what the hell?
[01:04.69]Ma- J- Tell him to put the light down.
[01:06.23]We're just playing.
[01:07.09]Dude, this is the dumbest thing ever.
[01:12.69]I feel bad for this guy.
[01:16.45]You burn him with the light?
[01:24.32]This poor guy.
[01:28.90]Is he dead?
[01:29.42]Dude, life sucks for this guy right now.
[01:35.60]This guy is just having a... Yeah, you'll be fine.
[01:43.77]You're obviously not slipping.
[01:47.35]I got you.
[01:48.13]Don't worry about it.
[01:48.97]Whoa.
[01:51.75]What?
[01:53.17]Oh, we're sliding down this right now?
[01:54.89]It's like a big slide!
[01:55.93]Weeee!
[02:00.35]Weeee!
[02:00.51]Look, you can see my little elf shoes!
[02:04.22]Why do I have, like, little elf cowboy boots on?
[02:08.88]Oh, no!
[02:10.88]Are these guys enemies?
[02:13.82]Is everybody an enemy?
[02:14.80]Who-who-who?
[02:17.94]Are you serious right now?
[02:24.20]What just killed him?
[02:25.98]Who shot him?
[02:26.52]Did he get just friendly fired?
[02:27.78]I think he did.
[02:31.06]Watch it, watch it.
[02:32.04]Mummies to your right.
[02:33.90]Don't worry, I got this.
[02:34.60]I'll flashlight him.
[02:35.98]I'm gonna do the flashlight and then you guys take care of him with the... What are you doing?
[02:39.28]Don't get that close!
[02:41.12]This guy's a fucking idiot!
[02:42.87]Why are you getting that close?
[02:47.69]Who would ever get that close to a mummy?
[02:50.71]Who would ever do that?
[02:57.53]Well, that's a pretty large machine gun.
[03:01.61]No.
[03:02.13]No, we're not doing it like this.
[03:03.85]We're not doing it like this.
[03:04.79]We're gonna see if I can use the light on people, too.
[03:07.91]Can I be the annoying flashlight guy on people?
[03:10.14]You really can.
[03:11.82]You seriously can be the annoying flashlight guy on pe- Oh, fuck!
[03:20.88]He's aiming it down here at my face!
[03:23.94]Oh!
[03:24.50]What?
[03:26.38]This guy apparently made his way to Hoth, which is interesting.
[03:30.71]Where's the AT-ATs?
[03:33.33]Where's the serial AT-ATs?
[03:38.68]What is that?
[03:41.42]What?
[03:43.12]What?
[03:43.50]Did I walk over another one of those mines?
[03:45.78]Or the tripwire things?
[03:47.76]No, there wasn't anything on the ground.
[03:49.47]What?
[03:51.95]I need to be sure about this.
[03:53.05]Another one of those trip mines killed me when I was looking at, like, the freak baby thing sitting on the table?
[03:59.52]Why is this place booby-trapped?
[04:02.18]What have they got to hide?
[04:03.18]Like, seriously.
[04:05.94]Okay, that hurt.
[04:08.78]No, there is not one of those in here.
[04:16.96]Who did that?
[04:18.76]Who does that, and who's stupid enough to walk into it?
[04:22.34]Apparently me.
[04:23.80]I guess I'm dumb enough to find, like, Buddha.
[04:28.90]Whatever this is.
[04:30.94]You see him?
[04:32.28]I can't really see him.
[04:33.64]He's down here somewhere, though.
[04:34.91]There's a bright-ass light over here.
[04:36.39]Well, just keep firing down there.
[04:37.69]You gotta be able to find him.
[04:38.75]We need to get this killed.
[04:40.95]I can't even tell where I'm shooting.
[04:43.01]Can you help me here?
[04:44.02]I can't... He's right next to you!
[04:45.48]What?
[04:45.72]You... Oh!
[04:46.82]What are you... That's over.
[04:58.28]Are we just not realizing what he just did?
[05:01.30]He's just like Incredible Hulk through a steel door.
[05:05.29]And they're having just a general conversation.
[05:07.33]You don't know how to speak that language, idiot!
[05:26.06]Oh, put down your waffles.
[05:30.18]Oh, that was such a funny joke.
[05:31.44]Oh, someone's shining a light in my face.
[05:51.89]See, how do you like it?
[05:53.71]How do you like having your eyes blinded by something?
[05:57.39]It sucks, doesn't it?
[06:01.04]So I have found... Han Solo from Star Wars when he's in, like, the steel glue shit.
[06:08.16]He has Luke Skywalker's lightsaber.
[06:09.86]This is not canon.
[06:11.10]This didn't happen in Star Wars.
[06:13.67]That's a... Look at this.
[06:14.63]Replica of a lightsaber.
[06:17.01]We'll see.
[06:17.31]We'll try to get him out of there and see what he has to say for himself.
[06:22.69]Han Solo, it's time to let you out of your chamber.
[06:28.30]Give us the secrets of the Millennium Falcon.
[06:30.56]Oh, God!
[06:31.96]What's with the light, dude?
[06:33.22]Oh!
[06:33.72]Oh, what's that?
[06:35.01]Don't shoot me!
[06:35.97]I just got out of the fucking goo!
[06:37.65]Oh, please!
[06:38.49]I just want to get... Where's Leia?
[06:40.07]Ah!
