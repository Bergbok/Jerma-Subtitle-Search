[00:01.30]Trees.
[00:02.24]Found trees.
[00:03.56]Found them.
[00:04.48]Right there.
[00:06.06]We can all calm down now.
[00:07.46]I found the trees.
[00:09.56]And I am going to starve to death.
[00:11.32]Oh, my God.
[00:12.58]Do I have any... I have, like, food, right?
[00:16.54]What if I eat the raw beef?
[00:17.68]Does it give me, like, E. coli?
[00:21.50]Oh, it doesn't... The rotting flesh is, like, better.
[00:27.60]No, it's not.
[00:29.20]Not at all.
[00:31.83]Alright, tree.
[00:35.12]There we are.
[00:37.12]No, I don't have a... No!
[00:41.24]Is this the only tree here?
[00:44.06]You're killing me!
[00:47.48]I need at least, like, a stack of wood to create my floor, my wooden paneling floor.
[00:54.78]Because I want to look like a rich person.
[00:58.42]Is that really the only damn tree here?
[01:01.65]The next tree is over there.
[01:06.72]Oh my god.
[01:09.30]I would sprint, but I don't want to lose all my hunger.
[01:12.68]Because that would be bad.
[01:13.62]I'm just going to eat all this rotten raw beef.
[01:17.82]Let's see if I get salmonella.
[01:21.32]Alright, so far so good.
[01:25.06]Oh yeah.
[01:26.88]I want to get up to that stupid tree up there.
[01:32.30]Alright, you've had your fun.
[01:33.64]Time for you to die.
[01:36.66]I'm only level two.
[01:38.95]Is that because I've died so many times?
[01:40.21]Alright, I have to make the trek up this mountain.
[01:43.79]To get this stupid tree.
[01:44.89]I haven't been leaving the breadcrumb trail.
[01:46.45]I'm going to get lost.
[01:48.21]And I'm never going to find the house again.
[01:49.67]I think I'll be alright.
[01:51.91]I can see there's a torch over there.
[01:54.05]I have to get up to this one other tree up here.
[01:56.09]This is ridiculous.
[02:00.89]One damn tree at the top of a mountain.
[02:05.15]What?
[02:06.61]Where the hell did you even come from?
[02:07.77]I'm knocking you off the cliff like I did your brother.
[02:11.92]Where is he?
[02:14.34]Get out of here.
[02:16.12]Get out of here.
[02:19.20]Oh, whatever.
[02:19.84]I'm just going to go away.
[02:21.66]Go away.
[02:22.30]I'll take it.
[02:22.64]I'll take it.
[02:24.70]Nice.
[02:25.07]Level three.
[02:27.49]Already this is gonna be cruel this cow.
[02:30.56]Oh, I can watch the sunset.
[02:32.06]I'm gonna knock this cow off Sorry cow, but you had it coming Plus I want your meat.
[02:40.90]I Want your meat look at this Now see Now see this is what it's all about guys watching the sunrise on the top of a mountain Looking down at all the beautiful stuff.
[02:56.37]Oh
[02:59.09]Oh, sorry cow!
[03:03.01]Oh, man.
[03:09.11]Come on, I can't believe I need to find some more trees.
[03:11.94]This is bad.
[03:12.70]How many wooden planks am I gonna get out of this?
[03:18.06]If I'm gonna get at least a stack of 64 wooden planks, I should be able to cover my whole ground level.
[03:26.78]And not even close.
[03:28.81]Kinda close, though.
[03:30.47]Actually, no, I got some of these, so, okay.
[03:33.47]If I can get one more tree.
[03:34.53]Where's one more tree?
[03:35.37]Oh, yeah, right down there.
[03:37.11]Alright, I need to go... Oh, no.
[03:41.51]Wait, hold on.
[03:42.89]Okay, it's this way.
[03:44.43]That's the way I gotta go.
[03:46.51]There's a tree right there, too.
[03:47.73]I'll take that tree and just go home, because I'm gonna get lost.
[03:51.02]Oh!
[03:52.14]That was close.
[03:53.78]I was actually very terrified about that one.
[03:56.78]Let's go!
[03:59.60]Let's get this last tree.
[04:00.70]And then go home.
[04:04.86]So I can build the rest of my floor.
[04:07.80]God.
[04:11.73]Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk.
[04:17.01]Okay, let's see if I can't get some floor out of that.
[04:18.63]So there's one of my torches.
[04:22.49]I see it.
[04:22.89]They see my breadcrumb trail I left.
[04:26.20]So far, so good.
[04:29.40]Give me more of these so I can make some pita bread.
[04:32.38]Alright, as I go, I'm going to take the torches back because that's a waste.
[04:50.27]Excellent.
[04:54.21]Excellente.
[05:04.33]Boink.
[05:05.13]Boink.
[05:09.79]And... Boink.
[05:12.89]Boink.
[05:18.46]Okay, so I'm on my way back.
[05:20.46]And I went all the way this way.
[05:22.78]All the way down there.
[05:23.84]Way past that thing.
[05:24.98]Up on a mountain.
[05:26.34]And there was a whole forest right there.
[05:29.14]So... Yeah.
[05:33.40]Whoops!
[05:33.60]Whoops!
[05:35.42]I'll come back to that later.
[05:41.91]We've collected the trees, we've collected the wood.
[05:45.99]Time to go back home and build up the house like we should.
[05:50.53]There's no reason to fear and there's no reason to fret.
[05:54.06]There's a creeper in my house!
[05:56.44]Get away from me!
[06:00.12]Don't ruin my house!
[06:01.44]Don't ruin my house!
