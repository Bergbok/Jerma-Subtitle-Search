[00:43.47]Hey.
[00:44.79]Hi, everybody.
[00:45.33]Yeah, sometimes we're late, sometimes we're early.
[00:51.92]That's the way it works.
[00:53.94]I'm never live at 7 o'clock.
[00:56.12]Just know that.
[00:58.24]You're gonna get... Every stream is gonna be between, like, 6.40 and, like, 7.45.
[01:03.63]I will never start the stream at, like, 7 o'clock.
[01:07.59]It's just... It's like a soft 7.
[01:09.33]That's what I've said a million times.
[01:12.84]We go and we're ready to go on the days that we're going.
[01:17.57]Anyways, hi.
[01:22.27]Good evening.
[01:24.77]I had the pleasure of purchasing a Sega CD.
[01:33.25]Let's just wait until people get in here, you know?
[01:37.04]Just turned on the stream.
[01:38.00]Let's get in here.
[01:44.03]Make sure that tweet goes through So took a while to hook up that took like a
[01:57.21]I had to get like an HD adapter, so this thing could actually be captured by a capture device.
[02:03.71]So it's going, I got Sega CD going into this capture device, going from their HDMI into my capture device, being captured into my computer onto OBS.
[02:18.21]I tested it a lot, it's gonna work.
[02:21.97]It should work pretty flawlessly.
[02:25.53]Although I've said that before and who knows how real that actually is going to be.
[02:32.99]But the things that we do to see things, right?
[02:39.28]This is a very old game.
[02:40.38]This game came out in 1993.
[02:41.14]It's funny because this game's actually getting like an HD remaster.
[02:46.76]It's coming out on PS4 in like two and a half weeks or like three weeks or something.
[02:51.82]But you know what?
[02:52.49]Fuck that.
[02:52.91]We're going to play the shitty original one.
[02:57.19]When are we going to start watching movies on stream?
[02:58.81]Like, right now.
[03:00.45]Like, legit tonight is when it's going to happen.
[03:13.18]Very old streamer streams a very old game.
[03:15.32]1993.
[03:15.34]Alright.
[03:16.66]So, let's go ahead and switch this over.
[03:27.41]No, Rumble?
[03:27.89]The Rumble was not going to be tonight.
[03:32.43]I was originally going to have it be potentially for tomorrow, but I want the whole weekend to dedicate making characters.
[03:39.57]I don't want to give you guys a half-assed wrestling card.
[03:42.93]I want to make a shitload of new characters.
[03:46.16]I don't want to have it be rushed.
[03:51.29]So, uh, let's turn this thing on and like pray that it fucking works.
[03:59.26]So here we go.
[04:01.00]Strap yourself in.
[04:03.84]Is this gonna fucking work?
[04:05.88]Here we go.
[04:08.20]Ding.
[04:08.54]Hey, look at that Sega CD.
[04:13.96]Checking the disc to make sure it's not all scratched the fuck up.
[04:22.06]This is an original Sega CD, by the way.
[04:24.44]This is a Sega CD.
[04:27.20]Wait, what's going on?
[04:29.28]First try.
[04:32.59]This is a real pain in the ass to get to work.
[04:35.87]We already got some, like, artifact in it.
[04:37.31]It's alright.
[04:42.09]I might have to, like, reset the device.
[04:47.38]That's a first.
[04:47.84]That is a first.
[04:53.02]Alright, you got, like, the sneaky James Bond character.
[04:55.76]Sneakin' by.
[04:56.46]Remember, this shit is original Night Trap.
[05:04.68]Alright, I gotta, like, I think I might have to, like, move this.
[05:06.49]Wait a minute, let me hold on.
[05:11.79]What if I do, like, do this?
[05:17.53]Written by Terry McDonald.
[05:20.16]Written by fuckin' Ronald McDonald.
[05:25.27]Clear.
[05:25.51]There you go.
[05:27.79]Oh, God, this looks like shit.
[05:30.34]I'm Commander Sims of the Sega Control Attack Team.
[05:34.62]Scat mission 230.
[05:35.26]Oh, my God, this looks great.
[05:37.00]Five teenage girls have disappeared after spending the night at the old Lakeshore Winery house of Mr. and Mrs. Victor Martin and their children, Jeff and Sarah.
[05:48.71]Oh, God, no, forget about Jeff and Sarah.
[05:52.10]Right now, another five girls are headed towards the Martins to spend the night.
[05:56.90]Your mission, protect those girls from whatever happened to the last ones.
[06:00.65]Okay.
[06:01.29]Now listen up.
[06:02.91]Last night, one of our agents got into the house and found some kind of weird security system.
[06:06.63]Hidden cameras in almost every room and a series of traps.
[06:09.65]Our agent spliced an override into the security system, allowing you to have control of the cameras and the traps with this remote unit.
[06:19.76]Use the traps to capture anyone or anything that endangers the lives of those girls.
[06:25.86]But make sure you don't trap someone you should be protecting.
[06:30.62]One slight problem.
[06:32.26]The traps are protected with an access code.
[06:35.13]They won't work unless you enter the right code.
[06:37.85]Right now, the code is set to blue, and you have control of the traps.
[06:42.43]But anyone inside the house can change that code at any time.
[06:46.03]So pay close attention to what they're saying.
[06:49.52]Man, make sure to take this.
[06:50.82]Our override cable is here in hallway one.
[06:53.37]Holy shit, I can't even see that.
[06:55.69]This thing might be a little funky.
[06:58.49]This is my attack squad.
[07:01.61]This looks way worse.
[07:02.89]One of my best undercover agents.
[07:04.96]She'll be arriving with the rest of the girls.
[07:08.26]I'm putting her life and the lives of those other girls in your hands.
[07:11.48]So don't even think messing up.
[07:15.32]If you don't have the brains or the guts for this assignment, give the controls to someone who does.
[07:20.52]Pass the controller to your older brother.
[07:22.24]The girl should be pulling into the driveway.
[07:25.20]Hold on a second.
[07:25.60]You're wasting time.
[07:26.74]Let's see what happens if I do this.
[07:27.87]Get over there now.
[07:29.63]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:30.85]Looks like you're not up to this mission.
[07:33.01]Breaking contact.
[07:33.83]Alright, so let's go.
[07:40.37]So he broke contact and now we make our way over to the house.
[07:48.21]What?
[07:50.73]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[07:51.37]Did I have to, like, press a button to, like, accept the fucking mission?
[07:56.13]Hold on, he just disconnected the Sega Genesis controller.
[07:59.35]All of a sudden, I, like, can't play the game?
[08:01.45]Wait.
[08:05.47]Oh, Jesus.
[08:06.17]Shit, hold on.
[08:12.38]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:14.08]I'm gonna get it to work.
[08:14.86]Everyone just hold on.
[08:24.77]Okay, I accepted the mission.
[08:29.68]Alright, so I gotta like walk around the house, right?
[08:33.78]It's currently on blue.
[08:37.34]This is like the bathroom.
[08:41.00]Oh, people!
[08:42.96]These are bad guys, right?
[08:50.06]What just fucking happened?
[08:54.14]I apparently had dropped the guy through like a trapdoor Where are the girls?
[09:07.79]Where are the people?
[09:08.73]What the fuck happened?
[09:15.55]Oh, look, there's another guy.
[09:17.17]He just went out the window.
[09:17.95]Hold on a minute.
[09:18.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:18.87]Okay, we got an entryway, we got a kitchen, we got a hall.
[09:21.97]Did I, like, what happened?
[09:22.67]Did I skip everything?
[09:26.30]I'm really confused right now.
[09:27.50]Is there anybody here?
[09:31.66]Oh, wait, wait, oh, alright.
[09:36.70]We got more, like, foot soldiers.
[09:37.90]We got more, like, putties from fucking Super Mario Brothers.
[09:41.00]I mean, Power Rangers.
[09:46.66]This is like these weird, like... Here we go.
[09:50.30]I got him.
[09:55.58]Alright, I think I may have missed, like, what the fuck.
[09:57.83]Who's this?
[09:58.25]What the fuck does that mean?
[10:17.03]So, what's happening tonight, Dad?
[10:19.91]Well, we have to bottle the two downstairs.
[10:21.82]Drop them?
[10:22.86]And Sarah's coming in with six more tonight.
[10:24.60]I don't think I can drop them.
[10:26.24]Yep.
[10:27.20]The problem is Sheila and I might have to make a delivery.
[10:30.10]That's no problem.
[10:30.74]Tony and I can handle it.
[10:31.78]Yeah, Tony and I can do it.
[10:33.08]I'm not so sure.
[10:34.19]Please have to go, too.
[10:36.01]So nobody has arrived yet.
[10:37.05]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[10:37.67]What's this?
[10:38.21]This is a special vintage.
[10:39.43]Oh, Jeffrey, don't be so selfish.
[10:41.45]Fuck the story.
[10:41.99]We got, like, we got, like, boogeymen to capture, right?
[10:45.07]Oh, wait, no.
[10:49.79]Here comes the sleepover party.
[10:51.20]All my friends are coming over.
[10:53.26]We're going to go on the Nickelodeon snick couch.
[10:57.90]Should I go outside?
[10:58.88]This is outside.
[10:59.96]They all should be here, right?
[11:01.14]Did this fucking lady come in a hover boat?
[11:18.38]Somebody came in like a jet ski.
[11:19.92]Hi, Megan.
[11:21.78]What?
[11:21.98]Oh, come on, everyone.

[11:30.85]Like, there's definitely gonna be, like, boogeymen, like, sneaking around right now.
[11:38.47]Oh, here we go.

[11:43.11]Dude, that guy, that guy, that was a pretty sick, like, box.

[11:53.12]I don't even... What do these machines do?
[11:57.76]I don't fucking understand this.
[12:00.52]Why is this house booby-trapped with a bunch of, like, fucking gas?
[12:03.40]That doesn't make any sense.
[12:04.34]Oh, here's another one.
[12:06.84]I hope there's no trap doors in here.
[12:08.44]Who will be sneaking this one?
[12:10.10]Oh, no, I'm gonna go through here.
[12:11.27]I'm gonna be in the hallway now.

[12:17.51]Who's that?
[12:20.71]That's Weird Eddie.
[12:21.91]He's just one of the neighbors.
[12:23.15]He's really cute.
[12:23.99]No, that's just Weird Eddie.
[12:27.06]He's really cute.
[12:30.78]What?
[12:31.60]Hold on, wait, did somebody just... What the fuck?
[12:35.82]Hold on, somebody just flew off the roof.

[12:41.07]I just, like, scared Weird Eddie.
[12:45.47]Oh, here comes another guy.
[12:46.61]Does he have a flamethrower?

[13:12.63]There's one guy left doing, like, the default modal combat pose.
[13:15.33]Where's he going?
[13:15.77]This guy's going up here?
[13:18.58]No, where'd he go?
[13:19.42]Down the way.

[14:27.75]Nope, didn't get him.
[14:31.05]That's hard to do, actually.
[14:31.99]And he's hiding in the closet now.
[14:33.05]This is not good.
[14:36.86]Where is our, where is, there they are.
[14:41.56]Okay, so the parents just left.

[15:06.73]Oh, okay, the parents are gone.
[15:13.23]Who built, yeah, I don't know who, who built this fucking house?

[15:33.66]And everybody start fucking dancing like a dickhead!
[15:37.34]Alright, yeah!
[15:40.32]Oh, I'm the shy one.
[15:41.20]I don't dance.
[15:42.48]Unless a boy asks me.
[15:46.92]Oh, look, he's doing electric guitar with a tennis racket!
[15:49.44]Alright, where are the murderers?
[15:58.10]Nothing.
[16:00.26]Activate the trap.
[16:01.24]I can't.
[16:01.92]I can only do it when there's a fucking putty from Power Rangers.
[16:05.51]Are they still dancing?
[16:09.13]They're doing like a karaoke night.
[16:11.09]Anybody outside?
[16:15.70]No, hey, Weird Eddie come back.
[16:17.92]Let me like launch Weird Eddie.
[16:22.99]So there are 32 people in this house.
[16:25.67]And I've only gotten 7 of them.
[16:28.11]Uh-oh, wait a minute.
[16:29.75]Wait a minute.
[16:30.65]There's a problem here.
[16:31.33]You hear that fucking scary music.
[16:32.90]This guy's about to die.
[16:34.38]I gotta help this guy.
[16:37.46]What does this lead to?
[16:39.14]He's locking the door.
[16:44.46]He's going out this way.
[16:45.95]He's in deep shit.
[16:50.43]Hello?
[16:52.23]Danger.
[16:55.38]I'm gonna have to fucking grab somebody.
[16:58.24]Wait, is he seeing the people that I captured?
[17:02.52]What the fuck are you doing?
[17:04.22]Oh, shit!
[17:04.96]Got him.
[17:05.16]What do you mean, denied?
[17:07.43]Denied?
[17:07.87]What's denied?
[17:08.39]I have the wrong code.
[17:11.99]Oh, Jesus.
[17:16.09]What?
[17:16.31]I have the wrong code.
[17:18.35]What code is it?
[17:19.84]How do I know what code it is?
[17:21.16]Should I have listened to these fucking people talk?
[17:25.34]Oh god dammit, Nickelodeon schnick.
[17:34.14]I don't know what the fucking code is.
[17:39.70]That girl just took her clothes off in the background for no reason.
[17:42.32]Why are they getting naked?
[17:43.86]Oh god.
[17:44.38]Oh, here we go.
[17:48.53]We'll see if you can get it fixed.
[17:50.49]If not, we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way.
[17:52.97]I could take all weekend.
[17:53.97]I got plans.
[17:55.45]Tell me, green?
[17:56.77]Come on, everyone.
[17:57.55]I'll show you to your rooms.
[17:58.62]OK.
[17:59.14]Somebody got a hold of the system.
[18:00.84]OK, what color is it?
[18:04.76]What's fine with?
[18:06.50]Look, it was your job to protect Kelly and the rest of those girls.
[18:10.67]From what I've just seen, the place is being overrun.
[18:13.37]You've missed way too many of those suckers.
[18:15.92]Until you figure out how to do your job, you're dismissed.
[18:18.92]What?
[18:19.28]Breaking contact.
[18:20.53]No, that's not how it works.
[18:21.65]You don't just unplug the player from the fucking console.
[18:25.51]You're in a state-of-the-art facility.
[18:26.81]You don't just unplug the USB and the whole system goes down.
[18:29.53]Okay.
[18:32.03]Too many suckers.
[18:35.27]Okay, that was great.
[18:38.70]No, fuck that.
[18:39.32]I'm doing it again.
[18:43.52]I'm doing it again.
[18:44.58]We need to get there.
[18:46.98]You had 7 out of 40 possible criminals.
[18:49.30]Well, what the fuck?
[18:49.98]How am I supposed to keep trying?
[18:53.07]I can't even skip this.
[18:54.47]Breaking contact.
[19:00.57]Yeah, I just unplugged your webcam.
[19:09.36]No, we're doing this again.
[19:11.06]I'll just fucking hard reset the goddamn console to get us back to where we were.
[19:15.06]Watch this shit.
[19:18.36]Easy.
[19:20.84]Bingo.
[19:29.82]Alright, let's do it.
[19:30.40]Am I gonna play the other Sega?
[19:33.63]I have a box behind me that is...
[19:38.88]FULL of Sega CD games.
[19:42.02]FULL of them.
[19:42.96]Alright, let's go.
[19:44.40]Fucking skip it.
[19:45.00]We know what to do.
[19:46.00]I need to get the right access code.
[19:47.65]I need to capture more criminals.
[19:50.61]So, we're just gonna skip the fucking round until we can find them.
[19:53.49]Here we go.
[19:53.95]Skip.
[19:54.31]Here we go.
[19:54.55]Let's go.
[19:55.23]Catch them all.
[19:56.59]Gotta get them all.
[19:59.09]Here comes one, right?
[20:00.17]Capture.
[20:00.93]Come on.
[20:07.66]Got these two.
[20:10.30]Smoked about.
[20:11.19]Nice.
[20:12.87]Keep going.
[20:16.01]More guys?
[20:16.81]No.
[20:17.73]Yep, yep.
[20:18.19]Sneaking in the fucking window.
[20:21.01]Two guys.
[20:25.40]No, no, no, no.
[20:27.86]No.
[20:29.38]No.
[20:33.08]I got at least one.
[20:33.70]Somebody got in the bathroom.
[20:35.00]No, where's the bathroom?
[20:42.28]Living room.
[20:42.76]Bathroom.
[20:44.29]No.
[20:44.73]Bathroom.
[20:51.19]What?
[20:51.93]What's going on?
[20:52.33]Did I get him?
[20:53.45]Alright, drop him.
[20:56.85]Alright, we got seven out of four.
[20:58.58]We got four out of seven.
[21:04.62]Dude, they... I didn't know they, like, spam these guys at you.
[21:07.30]Alright, we're ready to go.
[21:14.59]Here we go.
[21:15.27]Get them both.
[21:17.13]Did I get one?
[21:18.05]Yep.
[21:18.51]Alright, that guy's like, he's not an idiot.
[21:20.55]I'll get him though.
[21:24.12]That is like such a shitty way to creepily like sneak around.
[21:26.60]Hall 2?
[21:30.32]You coming out the hall?
[21:32.02]Entryway?
[21:33.74]Bedroom?
[21:36.89]What the fuck?
[21:39.93]Oh, you fucking prick.
[21:46.95]This is like way harder than it looks.
[21:51.45]There he is.
[21:51.81]We gotta sneak out of here!
[21:55.14]Drop him.
[21:59.48]How many can I not miss?
[22:08.85]You gotta fucking memorize everybody.
[22:12.41]Is it like 50%?
[22:12.73]Am I gonna be okay with 50%?
[22:16.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[22:18.77]Like, don't do anything bad.
[22:20.29]Don't do anything illegal.
[22:21.21]Oh, here they are.
[22:28.21]What an innocent song to be singing.
[22:29.83]Nope, we're gonna find another guy.
[22:31.03]Right here, right?
[22:31.52]I just heard, like, the creepy music.
[22:34.48]Nope.
[22:37.86]Dude, I am so paranoid right now.
[22:39.42]I don't know.
[22:39.78]I don't want anybody else to get in.
[22:40.84]40 people got in last time?
[22:44.32]Dude, you can't even, like, watch the cutscene.
[22:47.34]They're here!
[22:53.54]Oh, come on.
[22:54.00]What is with this, like, Five Nights at Freddy's bullshit?
[22:57.76]Now I know where they got the idea.
[22:58.90]What are the characters in Five Nights at Freddy's?
[23:04.21]Caddy?
[23:07.05]Katrina?
[23:09.63]Roxo?
[23:12.93]I'd much rather stay here and enjoy...
[23:19.00]We're playing fucking Five Nights at Freddy's 1.
[23:21.08]How come no one else has tried to come in?
[23:23.02]I know for a fact this guy that's on the roof, right?
[23:26.59]Guy comes out on the roof.
[23:32.13]Socko?
[23:33.35]No, it's right when they're about to come in.
[23:35.94]God damn it!
[23:38.36]Where the fuck did you guys even come from?
[23:42.90]Got him.
[23:43.96]I got all of them.
[23:46.04]Oh, nice!
[23:46.60]The old slip-and-slide staircase trick!
[23:51.31]Where's that guy going?
[23:54.93]There he is, going up the stairs.
[23:55.93]No, in the window again.
[24:01.07]Come on.
[24:02.51]Come on!
[24:04.03]Oh my fucking god.
[24:05.37]He's gonna get away.
[24:06.71]Because I don't have an opportunity to grab him.
[24:08.57]That thing?
[24:08.97]Okay, so if you don't know how... You fucking asshole.
[24:12.92]Just die.
[24:13.96]Got him.
[24:18.50]Alright, well he's gone.
[24:19.26]Go out the window.
[24:19.84]There's a guy out here.
[24:22.02]Fifteen got in.
[24:24.49]There's weird Eddie.
[24:27.03]Oh, in here.
[24:29.89]Got it, come on.
[24:34.77]I got them both.
[24:37.69]This game is fucking stupid.
[24:42.11]Night trap.
[24:42.71]Here he is.
[24:43.36]He's on the roof, right?
[24:44.88]He sneaks on the roof.
[24:49.17]Fuck you, Eddie.
[24:49.80]Dude, I just want to get to, like, the party.
[24:54.40]Apparently... Here he is.
[24:58.30]Gotta get all three of these guys.
[25:05.69]And there it is.
[25:07.23]I got one of them, apparently.
[25:12.01]What about these guys?
[25:13.41]Where are they all going?
[25:14.23]Bedroom?
[25:16.07]No, what room are they... I don't even know what room they're fucking going into.
[25:22.38]They're all in here.
[25:23.02]Come on!
[25:24.90]Dude, that guy's got one of those old lady grabbers.
[25:27.43]Oh my fucking lord.
[25:38.40]Come on!
[25:40.44]I don't want to fail it again.
[25:41.56]Well, I'll get this guy.
[25:45.48]Nope, I won't.
[25:47.26]I will not get this guy.
[25:51.33]Yeah, I will.
[25:51.83]Fuck you, buddy.
[25:56.29]Is it enough, though?
[25:57.30]Is it enough for me to not get yelled at by my superior?
[26:02.36]And remember, they changed the code, too.
[26:04.61]Like, I need to know what the fucking code is.
[26:12.46]Nobody outside.
[26:13.78]Nobody in the fucking Nickelodeon.
[26:14.80]Yep.
[26:15.34]Two guys in the Nickelodeon.
[26:16.24]Got one of them.
[26:20.43]Is he going outside?
[26:21.01]Yeah, he's going outside.
[26:23.55]Where is he?
[26:26.31]Where is this prick?
[26:26.99]Come on.
[26:29.09]No, this is a stupid rock and roll music.
[26:39.34]I need to know what the fucking access code changes to.
[26:46.25]No, he just told him to go fuck off, okay?
[26:48.41]He said, go die, Eddie.
[26:50.15]Hey, Spencer, what's going on?
[26:56.55]Dude, this is... What the fuck?
[26:58.33]Where are these people even coming from?
[26:59.81]That's not even fair.
[27:04.37]To green.
[27:05.05]Don't worry, Mom.
[27:06.09]Green?
[27:06.25]It's all in the fingers.
[27:07.49]Good hunting.
[27:08.72]Okay, I think he just said... He just said green, didn't he?
[27:11.88]Okay, they just said they would change... I swear to God, we just caught them saying they changed the code to green.
[27:16.18]Right?
[27:16.66]That's what I just heard, right?
[27:22.34]Axe is fucking denied.
[27:23.34]Get the glue, quick!
[27:24.60]Oh my god, dude, this game.
[27:29.66]Am I outside?
[27:39.96]No.
[27:42.48]And here comes their dance.
[27:43.64]Like, I can't have, like...
[27:46.61]Oh, fucking God.
[27:47.97]Seriously, dude.
[27:49.93]I end up catching them at the exact last second.
[27:53.95]And then two more guys got in.
[28:04.04]Like, now it's green.
[28:08.48]Nobody's going to be in the living room while they're dancing around.
[28:11.04]So I need to just hang out in these rooms.
[28:14.46]Here they are.
[28:14.94]Guy right here.
[28:16.35]No.
[28:16.67]You just got the tail end of me.
[28:17.91]You got me right when I was walking out of the fucking room.
[28:31.70]Outside.
[28:32.58]In here.
[28:34.02]Right here, right?
[28:35.66]Two guys.
[28:37.40]Got him.
[28:40.58]Fucking burned him alive.
[28:43.42]Got it.
[28:43.94]Let's go.
[28:47.97]Another guy in here, you can tell because the CD has to... Who the fuck is that?
[28:51.85]Who is this guy?
[28:52.41]Who's this Rambo guy?
[28:55.27]Is this a bad guy?
[28:55.91]Why does he have a machine gun?
[29:01.51]Why is this guy in the house?
[29:03.74]This guy went to the wrong party.
[29:05.46]This guy went to like a fucking costume party.
[29:08.98]What am I supposed to... Wait, what is happening to this guy?
[29:13.80]What?
[29:14.08]Who the fuck is this guy?
[29:15.42]Did anybody catch that?
[29:21.08]Okay, that guy was like part of the army.
[29:31.23]I guess I understand.
[29:34.43]We did not get introduced to that character.
[29:35.91]35 have gotten in here.
[29:40.81]Oh, shit.
[29:41.75]Okay, this is where the little kid- This is where we got- This is where we lost before.
[29:43.85]I gotta get all these guys.
[29:44.65]Here it comes.
[29:45.99]Got him.
[29:49.51]Little kid saved.
[29:53.79]Now what?
[29:56.57]This is where I lost last time.
[30:02.37]I hate hearing that little blip knowing that somebody got away.
[30:05.42]There's another one.
[30:08.00]This endless supply of fucking random dudes.
[30:12.75]Literally just pushed him into the same place as the kid.
[30:14.95]Fucking where did the- There's no- Okay, no one is ever on that part.
[30:23.76]They're always in these three, like, or four places.
[30:28.06]Kitchen, hall, bedroom, bathroom.
[30:31.04]They never are anywhere else.
[30:36.97]And, excuse me, where the fuck was that guy?
[30:43.99]Here he comes.
[30:46.97]Yep.
[30:48.11]Someone's coming in.
[30:48.59]Did you see the background?
[30:51.50]Oh my fucking god.
[30:56.34]Alright, honestly, what is with this house?
[31:00.38]Why do all the criminals want to come here?
[31:03.34]Why is this just the place that every criminal goes?
[31:05.60]It better still be green.
[31:11.97]Alright, get him.
[31:17.58]Get them!
[31:18.20]Wha- wh- where's my- Oh, Jesus Christ.
[31:22.96]How many bedrooms are there?
[31:23.90]There's only one bedroom.
[31:24.74]Are they all gonna sleep in the same room?
[31:30.41]Oh, shit.
[31:34.91]Come here.
[31:38.84]Oh, God, it's a different color.
[31:40.28]It's different now.
[31:41.30]Oh, shit.
[31:42.18]Is it red?
[31:42.60]Alright, we're gonna see if it's red.
[31:43.94]Sneaky.
[31:58.02]That lady was checking to see if they were cutting yet.
[32:02.72]At least we're still playing the game.
[32:04.16]I need to keep paying attention here.
[32:06.92]I need to see if I'm on the right code.
[32:08.53]Who the fuck is this?
[32:22.86]Oh, did he just tell me what the code was?
[32:28.84]What?
[32:30.86]Why did that guy... Who is this guy?
[32:34.70]This guy just, like, coming in the house.
[32:42.01]And his bod.
[32:43.17]Yay.
[32:43.99]We need to listen.
[32:44.99]Sarah, what is this?
[32:48.55]Oh.
[32:50.01]My father collects weird things.
[32:52.73]I love how that's the excuse.
[32:53.67]My father collects weird things.
[33:00.20]Oh, God.
[33:00.68]Everyone's, like, running out now.
[33:03.58]At least that there's no one... I got a criminal.
[33:05.36]Come on.
[33:06.00]It's gotta be Red, right?
[33:09.22]Why would they change it to something else?
[33:10.44]Like, if it's not, like, right in the middle.
[33:12.82]What are they doing?
[33:13.38]They're about to, like, turn off, like, the fucking breaker?
[33:19.51]Who is that?
[33:22.43]What person is this?
[33:24.68]Is this the guy that was just outside?
[33:26.40]He's sticking like a syringe in his neck.
[33:29.98]They're draining this guy's fluid.
[33:39.05]Wait, is that weird Eddie?
[33:42.67]Who the fuck?
[33:43.85]Wait, that guy just came in.
[33:45.45]That guy just came in and like looked over here and was like, oh shit, and left.
[33:48.35]It's a guy-
[33:56.21]Oh god, wait a minute!
[33:59.45]Come on, trap them, here we go, here we go!
[34:02.27]I got them all.
[34:03.85]No I didn't, I got one.
[34:05.95]It's red.
[34:12.12]We're okay, everyone's fine.
[34:16.28]We just have to move around, we just have to go around the party, go outside.
[34:20.20]Okay, this guy has decided to leave the house.
[34:23.70]He rang the doorbell and was like, nope, I don't think I'm gonna stay here, I'm gonna leave now.
[34:29.67]He like, fucking waddles up the front steps.
[34:32.07]Oh, he's gone.
[34:36.33]Got a guy in the bathroom.
[34:39.23]Oh, shit.
[34:40.75]Oh god, this could be our first murder.
[34:45.89]I love how you can see through.
[34:47.83]He can see through the fucking glass of the shower.
[34:50.05]But he had to peek over.
[34:51.09]I gotta get this guy, right?
[34:53.37]I gotta trap him right when he comes out.
[35:02.71]Alright.
[35:07.23]No.
[35:07.65]Wait.
[35:08.09]Hey.
[35:09.67]How do I... What do I do?
[35:12.22]What am I supposed to do here?
[35:13.06]Trap him, right?
[35:13.72]Here we go.
[35:14.98]Got him.
[35:16.98]Got him.
[35:20.16]I gotta get them all.
[35:21.34]No, there's more than one.
[35:22.32]There's in fact like three people in here.
[35:27.89]Are they supposed to be aliens or what?
[35:29.13]I don't... Did I win?
[35:32.31]Nope, they're going in here.
[35:34.35]Gotta get a trap.
[35:36.41]Nice toss.
[35:37.39]Nice fucking hip toss.
[35:39.32]Watch out for the guy with the giant leg.
[35:41.02]Oh, she's going out the window.
[35:42.42]Can I trap him?
[35:48.29]Outside, right?
[35:48.76]Oh, fuck.
[35:52.28]Where did she go?
[35:52.70]What happened to all the other girls?
[35:56.54]So that girl just jumped out the window.
[36:03.85]Fuck.
[36:08.91]Come on, we gotta get out of here.
[36:09.99]They're after us.
[36:11.35]Yeah, nice try, kid.
[36:13.03]I'm serious.
[36:13.73]Come on, I'll show you.
[36:14.73]Wait a minute, Danny.
[36:15.45]Just calm down and tell us exactly what you saw.
[36:18.08]I went down in the basement and I saw these control rooms with monitors and buttons for traps.
[36:24.48]Oh, shit.
[36:25.46]We just heard the same audio clip twice.
[36:28.26]What?
[36:29.14]Oh, my God.
[36:29.42]Don't do it.
[36:29.80]Don't do it.
[36:30.32]Oh.
[36:30.76]They got her.
[36:31.46]Apparently, they got her.
[36:32.42]Well...
[37:00.68]Well, there's the original Night Trap for you.
[37:05.44]We could try one more time.
[37:11.40]I'm willing to give it one more attempt.
[37:18.91]Why am I so bad at fucking Night Trap for Sega CD?
[37:26.26]You can't be bad at Night Trap.
[37:28.30]The game is just fucking stupid.
[37:30.92]It's a stupid game.
[37:32.26]I'm the associate producer.
[37:52.49]This game is unbelievably hard.
[37:55.19]From my understanding, this game is, like, fucking impossible.
[38:07.76]Alright, for the sake of, like... I have a lot of shit in this box.
[38:14.33]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[38:16.23]Well... That might not be the end of Night Trap.
[38:22.03]Play the 32X version.
[38:23.13]I don't have a 32X.
[38:26.35]Let's just swap in Wirehead.
[38:29.55]This one could be fucking outrageous.
[38:31.15]Let's do Wirehead.
[38:33.55]Let's give it a try.
[38:42.62]I bought this one.
[38:44.04]There's so much random shit in here, dude.
[38:46.50]I have so many Sega CD games.
[38:48.28]We'll never do them all.
[38:50.54]We're never going to complete all these.
[38:55.23]Shit, where is it?
[38:57.61]Actually, no, fuck that.
[38:58.27]We're going to put this one in.
[39:04.23]So many.
[39:05.75]All right, let's do... Let's do this one.
[39:11.24]All right, this one's called double switch.
[39:19.76]Don't ask me how any of this is going to work.
[39:25.36]Here we go.
[39:27.88]We're currently putting in Double Switch.
[39:32.01]That's the name of this game.
[39:33.27]Double Switch.
[39:35.37]We should probably change that.
[39:36.97]I don't even know if this game's on.
[39:41.77]How's it going to work?
[39:42.49]No fucking clue.
[39:45.11]No, we're not playing the Switch.
[39:46.73]I'm putting on Double Switch.
[39:51.37]Here we go.
[39:57.80]Checking this.
[40:00.00]Here we go.
[40:03.28]Double Dragon?
[40:03.86]No, not Double Dragon.
[40:04.64]Oh, by the way, while I have a second.
[40:07.50]Thank you to Zach for the $5.
[40:10.44]Solid Snake just got pounded.
[40:14.04]Made by the same fucking company that made Night Trap.
[40:16.32]You know it's gonna be fucking fantastic.
[40:18.99]Thank you to Jen Betters for the dollar.
[40:22.73]Also, thank you, Jen.
[40:23.60]Jen betters with multiple dollars.
[40:28.92]Thank you for the, it looks like $6, Jen.
[40:31.90]Got to get them when the bar's red.
[40:32.84]Yeah, you have to trap them when the bar turns red, but who knows.
[40:38.04]Thank you to Spektag.
[40:39.95]This looks awful, I love it.
[40:42.31]You do a buddy stream.
[40:43.01]Let's play it back to the future.
[40:56.42]Director of Photography.
[40:58.97]This one, see, this one, like, looks bad.
[41:01.73]This is very, very wrong.
[41:04.15]Let me solve that.
[41:10.49]This looks like somebody, like... It sounds like somebody pitch-shifted, like a Tim Burton song, did not get copyright claimed on YouTube.
[41:19.72]All right, here we go.
[41:24.24]Start options or high score.
[41:30.43]What are the options?
[41:34.27]Enter internal RAM unformatted.
[41:37.55]Please format the internal RAM from the CD BIOS panel.
[41:44.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[41:48.06]Traps.
[41:48.56]We got more traps.
[41:50.08]We got a changing room.
[41:51.24]Arm trap.
[41:51.90]Disarm trap.
[41:53.94]What in the name of God?
[41:55.06]First start to activate.
[41:58.32]No, get me out of here.
[42:00.26]Why did I do this?
[42:02.08]How do I get out?
[42:03.38]Return.
[42:04.53]Okay, here we go.
[42:05.15]Double switch.
[42:07.11]Let's go.
[42:08.81]Oh, God.
[42:12.61]We're good.
[42:13.87]Yeah.
[42:16.53]Hi.
[42:18.17]My name is Eddie.
[42:19.61]I need your help.
[42:20.39]Another creepy Eddie.
[42:21.23]This is my building.
[42:22.61]And since the neighborhood really sucks, I built all these traps and security systems to protect the people who live here.
[42:28.74]The problem is some bonehead locked me in the basement and cut off my controls.
[42:32.46]So they forgot about the phone lines, which is how I got you in.
[42:36.40]Now you can protect the tenants and get me out of here.
[42:41.53]You and me are friends, right?
[42:42.73]You gotta help me.
[42:46.71]I love how they just throw you in here.
[42:50.47]It's the same game.
[42:52.09]Now this is the lobby.
[42:53.91]That's Elizabeth.
[42:54.85]She's the manager.
[42:56.05]There's a problem.
[42:56.81]Don't expect her to deal with it, okay?
[42:59.15]Okay.
[42:59.53]You can see the traps and triggers for each room by pressing the start button.
[43:03.52]Oh, yeah.
[43:04.48]To get me out of here, you gotta get the number from each of these power boxes.
[43:08.36]Now, they flash on when anybody opens them, so you keep your eyes peeled, okay?
[43:12.56]This is Brutus.
[43:13.68]He just got out of prison.
[43:14.96]This guy using a fucking metal detector inside of a house?
[43:17.41]But I don't like anybody snooping around my place, okay?
[43:21.23]This is Alex's room.
[43:22.31]This guy looking for fucking old coins?
[43:24.09]New girl in town.
[43:24.99]Says she's a journalist.
[43:27.57]I think she likes me.
[43:31.42]Lyle, the handyman.
[43:33.34]He's the one who's been screwing everything up around here.
[43:36.56]Trap him whenever you can.
[43:40.10]There's an emergency alarm going off in Alex's apartment.
[43:42.96]Use your cursor to get up there, see what's going on.
[43:47.74]All right, let's see what's going on.
[43:48.92]This is central, right?
[43:55.70]He was about to yell at me.
[43:56.61]Alright, so what's a phone box?
[44:00.47]Power punch.
[44:04.65]Am I... What am I supposed to do with this guy?
[44:10.05]Alex can.
[44:12.31]Shut up.
[44:17.66]Hey, now you're making me look bad.
[44:23.70]Screw up again and you're gone.
[44:28.53]Wait, what?
[44:29.39]I don't understand.
[44:31.09]Fireplace window.
[44:34.25]Oh fire, okay, I see, I see.
[44:38.75]Window.
[44:40.56]Fireplace.
[44:46.10]Wait, I don't think I understand what's going on here.
[44:53.17]Lobby cam.
[44:55.01]Fan and column.
[45:00.25]Power overloaded.
[45:05.79]Does that mean it's like armed?
[45:09.05]Does anybody have any fucking idea?
[45:10.37]You let the suckers get to the power box.
[45:12.61]What the fuck?
[45:13.47]And now we're all cut off.
[45:19.62]There was no rhyme or reason to any of that.
[45:25.40]We have to figure this out though.
[45:26.70]This is important.
[45:31.52]So, hold on, let's go to the options.
[45:34.84]House traps, between house and traps is C, okay?
[45:38.92]Change room is A, arm trap is A, and disarm trap is B. Okay.
[45:52.60]We have to figure this out.
[45:55.34]So, I can skip this, right?
[45:57.67]Oh, he's mad at me.
[45:59.65]Okay.
[46:02.26]So you change rooms.
[46:03.62]So here we go, we gotta go in here.
[46:04.46]We gotta go up here right now.
[46:06.42]Alex can- Okay.
[46:15.88]So lemme- here are the traps, right?
[46:17.37]So arm trap is window.
[46:18.71]Trap- arm it.
[46:20.41]That's arm.
[46:23.47]Fireplace is now arm.
[46:24.51]What did he just do?
[46:26.27]He just stepped on something.
[46:29.41]I don't understand!
[46:35.58]Don't I have these things armed?
[46:37.68]Hey, now you're making me look bad.
[46:41.24]Screw up again.
[46:41.94]He stepped on the thing and she just screams.
[46:45.80]Okay.
[46:50.02]These are both armed.
[46:51.62]Fireplace and window are armed.
[46:53.28]He's touching them right now.
[46:54.64]They're armed.
[46:56.08]These are both armed.
[46:59.43]Shouldn't that have activated and fucking killed him?
[47:05.53]Don't ask me.
[47:07.11]I have no idea.
[47:10.13]Now we're on the band camp.
[47:11.53]Let's turn on the mummy.
[47:13.69]This arm.
[47:14.15]The mummy's arm.
[47:15.09]How do I actually use it?
[47:17.47]It doesn't make any sense.
[47:18.79]Do you have to trigger them?
[47:20.35]I don't think so.
[47:21.09]You said you just arm them.
[47:37.74]There's so many ways people could do, like, stupidly die in this game.
[47:40.12]Like, I need to figure out what's going on.
[47:44.06]Let's try it again.
[47:47.77]Come on, yell at me again.
[47:51.31]Maybe I have to go past green.
[47:52.81]That's what I'm doing.
[47:56.53]Alright, let's go.
[48:07.03]Yeah, I know.
[48:07.82]Cover me.
[48:08.54]I'm in trouble.
[48:09.06]Okay, so let's go with, like, window.
[48:14.34]So this is armed now.
[48:15.48]Maybe I have to press it one more time?
[48:20.74]Maybe he has to be standing on it.
[48:24.43]Like, when it beeps.
[48:27.27]Got it, right?
[48:27.97]No?
[48:38.80]Uh, so if I... Hey, you're making me look bad.
[48:45.23]Okay.
[48:47.05]Screw up again, and you're gone.
[48:49.23]That's the window?
[48:49.97]Oh, yeah, but, like, I mean... So, if I... Let's go over here.
[48:55.40]Grads cam.
[48:56.34]Okay, there's... Coffin.
[48:59.68]And... What the hell?
[49:00.48]Whatever the hell that is.
[49:02.32]There's nobody here.
[49:06.00]What about, like, over here?
[49:08.39]In the lobby.
[49:08.77]Seems like your kind of thing, Phoebe.
[49:10.63]Thank you, Mrs. Edward.
[49:12.41]Fan column.
[49:13.47]Elizabeth, girls.
[49:14.65]Somebody like is up here.
[49:15.53]This is like the box, right?
[49:19.46]We're like up here.
[49:20.30]Brutus cam punch.
[49:31.28]Power box.
[49:34.63]Okay, he turned off the power.
[49:35.51]You let those suckers get to the power box.
[49:38.69]And now we're all cut off.
[49:40.53]It has to be primed when he steps on it, but yeah, but it... I did that already.
[49:44.91]This could be so funny, too, if the game actually, like, physically functioned.
[49:55.66]We're gonna try Fireplace first, and then I'm literally turning the console off and putting another game in.
[50:04.40]This doesn't seem to be very much rhyme or reason to any of this.
[50:08.56]I'm gonna prime the fireplace.
[50:14.26]Okay, fireplace.
[50:21.44]Prime.
[50:23.57]Wait, the fireplace is ready.
[50:26.05]Okay, here he comes.
[50:29.99]Fireplace.
[50:34.61]That didn't do anything.
[50:35.51]Get the fuck out of here.
[50:47.22]Let's put it in another one.
[50:51.58]Give me a fucking break.
[50:58.86]Give me this one.
[50:59.48]This one's called Surgical Strike.
[51:07.16]surgical strike continues and here we go press it when he's on the trap I I did that like three different times let's play let's just play surgical strike we can always go back to the past
[51:36.15]This is why they call me the surgeon.
[51:40.85]Thank you Glazed Donut for the bits.
[51:42.93]Also, bleh, let me just burp.
[51:46.08]Thank you Zack for the bits.
[51:48.04]This game gave me a migraine.
[51:50.68]That's what I was doing for.
[51:52.54]I did that like three fucking times.
[51:57.92]Not how you do it.
[51:59.16]I can guarantee it.
[52:05.22]It's happened.
[52:07.63]A renegade terrorist has begun launching missiles on innocent civilian populations.
[52:13.33]Somebody just turned up the volume way too loud on this one.
[52:15.94]...a path of destruction across the Middle East.
[52:17.80]I am invincible.
[52:20.52]What the fuck?
[52:30.50]Executive River Chris Beckman.
[52:32.16]Alright, let me like...
[52:34.50]U.N.
[52:34.62]Secretary General has called for a surgical strike.
[52:40.68]Good.
[52:41.04]Offer a surgical strike.
[52:43.40]Oh, this is... Did you see that guy flying?
[52:48.47]This is too much red.
[52:49.61]All I can see is red explosions.
[52:51.59]...stop before their killing and brutality cause any more bloodshed.
[52:54.51]Is that Martin Sheen talking, by the way?
[52:58.59]Okay.
[52:59.55]Surgical strike, 1985, Sega CD.
[53:04.42]Please format the built-in memory.
[53:08.16]Why do they always say that shit?
[53:09.70]Intro.
[53:11.88]Let's see what's going on.
[53:17.39]Touch TV movie.
[53:20.73]Wait, did we already see this?
[53:22.05]It's happened.
[53:26.99]I already watched the intro.

[54:09.20]...depleted uranium heads cut through tanks like butter.
[54:13.24]Okay, soldier.
[54:14.52]Cabool knows you're here.
[54:16.10]You're gonna have to find your own way in.
[54:18.38]JJ and I'll give the look down from here.
[54:21.29]He's got a fucking terrifying stare.
[54:23.35]Alright.
[54:24.53]Uh... Where does that want me to go?
[54:30.23]What?
[54:33.47]Take out the missiles before they get off the ground.
[54:35.81]Shoot for the boosters.
[54:37.59]Shoot for the boosters.
[54:40.05]Oh my fucking god.
[54:45.92]Wait, this is still going?
[54:48.42]What is happening?
[54:49.26]Why did I just explode?
[54:50.26]Did I explode a tank?
[54:54.90]Which way do I go?
[54:55.60]Turn!
[54:56.52]Turn!
[54:57.67]We got snipers all up the roof there!
[55:00.81]Fire!
[55:04.04]Dude, everything is melding together.
[55:08.44]It's not even possible to see who's who.

[55:44.94]I can't even like fucking tell you guys what I'm doing.
[55:49.31]It's just the cameras moving left and right really fast and then things are exploding on the screen.
[55:55.47]What the fuck?
[56:01.61]Who's this guy?
[56:27.62]My fucking head is killing me right now.
[56:34.08]I don't know.
[56:35.54]There's no rhyme or reason to any of this shit.
[56:37.82]This is the fucking best game I've ever played.
[56:42.20]Am I dead?
[56:52.79]I think that was my car that exploded.
[56:57.99]You don't look you don't listen and you don't think You have elevated being deaf dumb and blind to a damn art form When you're on the ground you can't think too much who is this guy you gotta feel it You hesitate boy.

[58:00.93]You know, you don't think, soldier.
[58:07.86]It's kind of ridiculous.
[58:08.96]You don't think ever.
[58:12.58]I mean, you're supposed to be tactically shooting these things.
[58:16.11]It's not like there's no rival reason to any of this entire fucking video game.
[58:19.53]Guy just ran by in a 3D suit and shot you, like, four times.
[58:23.44]Get this guy up there.
[58:24.42]Fuck!
[58:24.74]I didn't get him.
[58:28.40]I ran out of gas.
[58:31.82]Is he talking about me?
[58:44.31]They don't even give me an opportunity to do anything.
[58:46.13]Like, seriously.
[58:47.11]What was that?
[58:52.13]I just blew up the whole street.
[59:00.55]Am I supposed to be turning?
[59:01.56]I am the damage.
[59:02.58]I am the problem.
[59:12.97]I'm just turning the car.
[59:13.83]Just turn it.
[59:14.81]My brain hurts.
[59:16.94]We're going to have to turn this one off real soon.
[59:21.10]Who are these people?
[59:21.98]We got snipers all up the roof there.
[59:32.39]This is the surgical strike.
[59:34.43]More like drop bombs in every single way.
[59:39.09]Everywhere.
[59:39.51]Look at how hard this is.
[59:40.53]I gotta hit this guy right now.
[59:41.55]Coming across the fucking screen.
[59:42.55]Right now.
[59:43.23]Watch this.
[59:43.49]Ready?
[59:43.95]Got him.
[59:44.95]Didn't get him.
[59:46.05]I lose.
[59:46.39]I think I'm dead.
[59:58.15]Soldier!
[59:59.17]If your brains were made of dynamite, you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose.
[60:04.02]Hey, don't lose it now.
[60:06.32]We're all in this together.
[60:10.60]All right, let's do another one.
[60:11.64]All right, that one was fucking great.
[60:16.67]That one was, that one, I actually liked that one.
[60:19.03]We're going to put this one in the good pile.
[60:21.25]That's in the pile, that's in the fucking good pile.
[60:23.47]All right, what about this one?
[60:34.54]And that's canon now.
[60:36.28]That's canon now.
[60:37.98]That's what happened.
[60:39.59]On to the next game.
[60:43.47]The next one is going to be... It's called... This way.
[60:55.56]Oh, man.
[60:56.12]I don't know about this one.
[60:57.48]Hold on.
[60:59.78]What even is this?
[61:04.67]All right.
[61:05.70]This one could be a real crowd pleaser.
[61:09.70]I don't know what this other one is because I didn't buy it.
[61:16.00]I bought this particular game and I'm going to put it in.
[61:18.82]You'll see it.
[61:20.38]And then it came with this other game that I didn't buy because I had to buy all these obviously like third party.
[61:24.94]So this is a free game.
[61:25.98]So we'll see what the free game is after.
[61:34.40]Oh, God.
[61:38.74]Let's go.
[61:43.27]This is going to be like an immediate next.
[61:45.99]Like, I'm going to fucking take this out immediately.
[61:53.80]Here we go.
[61:59.48]No, it is not Madden.
[62:05.82]Same company.
[62:09.60]They just shit out so many of these.
[62:12.62]Make my video.
[62:13.70]Marky Mark and Funky Mark.
[62:19.60]Marky Mark.
[62:20.15]Mark Wahlberg presents...
[62:48.11]Here comes the copyright claim on the whole stream.
[62:52.85]I would skip this, but I don't want to.
[62:57.11]Skipping this would be a bad idea.
[63:00.27]Nobody jumps into bed like that.
[63:01.45]And what's with this fucking video quality?
[63:02.93]Is the game black and white?
[63:07.44]You have to trap Mark Wahlberg.
[63:10.26]Oh, I would laugh my ass off.
[63:13.00]If you had to like drop Mark Wahlberg down a fucking 1980s cartoon trapdoor.
[63:18.89]There's this guy looking around at his room like cleaning his room.
[63:22.13]Where's the game?
[63:22.79]This is the longest fucking shitty establishing shot I've ever seen.
[63:26.75]This is just such an excuse to put these beginning credits here.
[63:40.01]He's gonna notice the camera now, and he's gonna be like, oh, hey, whoa, what's up, dude?
[63:45.66]That's not even Mark Wahlberg.
[63:48.48]Is that Mark Wahlberg?
[63:49.36]No, he wasn't, like, fucking seven when this video was made.
[63:52.00]Okay.
[63:55.32]Alright, like...
[64:07.05]He's so cute.
[64:09.19]You're such a perv.
[64:10.35]This guy is a serious musician.
[64:12.27]This video should be tough.
[64:14.35]It's too sexy for his shirt.
[64:16.57]Can't live with him?
[64:18.70]Then shoot him.
[64:20.06]What the fuck?
[64:20.66]Make my video.
[64:21.98]Make my video.
[64:23.26]What the fuck is going on right now?
[64:29.34]This isn't gonna work.
[64:32.04]Let's ask someone else what they would do.
[64:37.59]Pick this guy.
[64:38.67]He'll be great.
[64:39.63]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:40.34]Hold on a minute.
[64:40.82]Hold on a minute.
[64:44.26]I like made this too big.
[64:48.48]Okay, to jam on a video with the girls... I need money, girls... Let's see our options here.
[64:54.91]Am I in, like, the girl's bathroom?
[64:56.45]What the fuck is going on?
[64:57.49]Well, it's gotta be... It's gotta be I need money, right?
[65:00.61]Let's go with the first one.
[65:12.45]Why are we asking these bambozos?
[65:14.57]It's not the guy's choice.
[65:16.29]Excuse me?
[65:16.91]No, alright, let's do it.
[65:17.97]These are close personal friends of mine.
[65:19.68]The guys.
[65:20.42]I need money with the guys.
[65:21.28]Fucking GM session takeover.
[65:27.56]Guys!
[65:29.10]Guys!
[65:29.46]We need five specific images for this video.
[65:33.81]Look at this awful wallpaper, by the way.
[65:36.13]I told you they couldn't do it.
[65:37.25]Hey, wait a minute.
[65:39.69]What if we have five different shots of pretty girls?

[66:30.10]The economy is strengthening.

[66:47.03]This thing here.
[66:47.63]Let's freeze it.
[66:52.52]Strobe it.
[66:54.22]Slow motion that.
[66:54.96]Slow motion that guy exploding.
[66:56.48]Flip that over, miracle.
[67:01.20]Do I just pick from like a series of images?
[67:03.18]Check this out.
[67:03.50]This is a mess.
[67:17.86]How much is left?
[67:18.98]Do I have to do the whole song?
[67:26.56]Oh, the thing in the middle is what's going on.
[67:29.98]That is going to make somebody throw up.
[67:35.08]This is going to be the worst fucking video ever.
[67:39.07]Look at the picture I made.
[67:40.09]I just smeared it and put a bunch of pictures on it.
[67:42.55]I've ruined the picture.
[67:52.60]Does Jeremy know what he's doing?
[67:53.80]Absolutely not.
[67:54.58]I need money.
[67:55.96]Yo, T-Man, I got this great idea.
[67:58.00]Well, the lyrics are... It's a good, like, YouTuber video where, like, every single thing that's said is written on the screen.
[68:03.50]That's how you can tell it's, like, a good video.
[68:07.78]Just in case you guys didn't know what was being said, let's, like, put it on the screen for the whole video.
[68:13.35]I need cash in a hurry and it just ain't funny.
[68:18.13]Alright, that's it.
[68:19.51]Yo, T-Man, enough is funny.
[68:23.20]Is there anything else I need to do?
[68:25.98]That's just a bunch of random royalty-free stock footage.
[68:33.63]Shots fired?
[68:34.49]What?
[68:34.75]No, I'm just saying that that's like every YouTuber.
[68:38.13]You have to do that.
[68:43.25]I'm just curious to see what happens after this.
[68:45.53]Because God knows we aren't going to fucking watch the video.
[68:54.97]This song was longer than two and a half minutes?
[68:56.93]That's the end, right?
[69:00.29]There's a person just falling downstairs.
[69:05.01]Somebody's just got a chair thrown at him over here on the left.
[69:09.68]Like, A has been the most, by far, besides Bill Clinton on B, A has had by far the best, like, stock footage.
[69:17.24]The other ones have been fucking shitty.
[69:19.60]God.
[69:21.22]Let's flip it around, splicing.
[69:24.52]Imagine having more than 10 minutes of fun with this game.
[69:27.96]I'd cry if I was a kid.
[69:45.58]I was fucking literally bald.
[69:47.80]Crying.
[69:48.24]This is the game that I got for Christmas.
[69:50.02]Oh, you can pause the music.
[69:51.82]Imagine getting any of these for Christmas.
[69:54.18]Dude, imagine getting a fucking Sega CD for Christmas.
[69:58.93]That would be pretty cool back in the day.
[70:02.05]I need...
[70:14.74]I'm gonna go look up right now just real quick.
[70:16.35]How long is I Need Money?
[70:19.25]How long is the song?
[70:25.11]Is the song... How much long does this come along?
[70:27.21]What's the exact time on I Need Money?
[70:28.65]3.42?
[70:28.69]That's not correct.
[70:29.35]I get you.
[70:30.07]Okay.
[70:30.41]4... It's too long for me.
[70:44.89]429?
[70:44.91]Alright, 429.
[70:48.53]We just have to see what happens at the end of this.
[70:54.87]That's fucking Ronald Reagan.
[70:57.85]Alright.
[71:00.69]That's the end.
[71:02.53]We did it.
[71:04.41]Is it time for playback?
[71:06.69]No.
[71:06.93]Already?
[71:08.43]Well, okay then.
[71:10.21]Let's go to playback.
[71:15.17]Well, today's unemployment figures show the economy is moving in the right direction.
[71:20.29]The drop in unemployment is one more sign that the economy is strengthening.
[71:27.69]This is so stupid.
[71:29.63]All right, how do I get out of this?
[71:32.45]I ain't fucking doing that again.
[71:46.00]Give me a second.
[71:47.90]Ah, shit.
[71:49.04]Oh, no.
[71:51.36]God fucking damn it, Marky Mark.
[71:53.12]You're a terrible fucking 90s video game.
[71:56.50]Now, what is this?
[72:01.29]I don't know what this is.
[72:08.09]This is called rock painting.
[72:10.51]Hold on.
[72:16.17]Is this a video game or is this an audio CD?
[72:22.47]I don't know.
[72:24.03]This is the... Okay.
[72:38.93]Is this like this guy's CD?
[72:40.43]Did this guy like pawn off a CD on me?
[72:45.40]Dude, I think this guy put this CD in the back.
[72:55.45]What else?
[72:55.79]What is this?
[73:01.65]It's just a CD.
[73:03.72]That's it.
[73:11.48]Why would you put this in here?
[73:14.85]I bought Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch Make My CD.
[73:19.51]And this guy put in like a fucking random audio CD.
[73:31.12]Okay.
[73:34.78]That turns off.
[73:37.80]Well, we've seen that.
[73:38.82]We're going on to the next one.
[73:41.90]All right.
[73:43.66]This one has potential, by the way.
[73:45.86]This one has a lot of potential.
[73:47.22]We're going to have to stay on this one for a while, I think.
[73:51.83]So get ready for potentially the remainder of the stream to be on this.
[73:56.65]Because the back of this box is fucking outrageous.
[74:05.90]So we're going to have to take a look.
[74:14.19]This one's called Ground Zero, Texas.
[74:15.95]It's apparently about, like, an alien invasion.
[74:22.27]Anyways, whole of one zombie, thanks for the $15.
[74:23.95]This is actually for the two internet joke.
[74:26.85]The two internets joke, as I wasn't awake to watch the last few live.
[74:30.30]Oh, well, thank you.
[74:32.50]Emperor William, Jen Betters again.
[74:35.22]Morning backup RAM has not been initialized.
[74:37.40]I'm going to have to, like, turn this off and on.
[74:41.88]But thank you, Jen.
[74:42.86]The Sega CD was a mistake.
[74:45.44]It could have been, but... I love this fucking thing.
[74:49.25]SticksRenegade, thank you for the $10.
[74:52.37]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[74:53.83]And they said, thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[74:56.53]And they said, thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[74:58.45]What?
[74:58.83]What?
[75:00.65]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $10.
[75:03.54]EmperorWilliam, thank you for the $4.
[75:05.70]Appreciate it.
[75:12.52]In this same exact time.
[75:16.04]Still, you know, we're gonna stick with it.
[75:28.55]Sega presented this, apparently.
[75:36.41]South Texas, on the U.S.-Mexican border.
[75:40.03]People have begun to disappear.
[75:42.33]Individuals, families, gone without a trace.
[75:46.45]All humanity is in danger.
[75:49.37]And this small Texas town sits at Ground Zero.
[75:54.32]Ground Zero, Texas.
[76:04.81]I like this one already.
[76:06.89]This one's already touching on some potential cool... There's gonna be a lot of fun things.
[76:12.68]We're gonna be on to it.
[76:14.60]I just need to know if I need to resize this.
[76:18.70]Yes, sir.
[76:19.22]If I need to resize the fucking screen, I will.
[76:26.50]Good luck, buddy.
[76:28.53]Good luck.
[76:28.81]Hey, it's Reece.
[76:30.07]I'm the agent in charge down here.
[76:32.09]We're real glad to see you.
[76:34.48]And we're running a little pushed on this thing, so try to keep up.
[76:37.90]This here's Pike.
[76:39.69]You're the new tactical expert.
[76:41.37]How are you?
[76:41.91]Right.
[76:42.43]Hop in.
[76:43.61]So I'm not driving the car.
[76:48.11]That's good.
[76:53.18]It's a pretty good JPEG quality.
[76:55.20]There's four others in town, and they're at your disposal.
[76:59.38]And what we're up against here is aliens that can take on human form.
[77:03.34]They could be disguised as townspeople to cover their activities.
[77:06.92]One of these guys is going to be... Welcome to the end of the world.
[77:09.24]Oh, man.
[77:11.94]I can't wait.
[77:13.14]We set up a command post here because of the central location.
[77:19.04]I can't wait for someone to turn into an alien.
[77:20.36]Beverly Hills it ain't.
[77:21.68]Just hope you do better than the last tactical operative.
[77:25.25]You're going to have to do better.
[77:27.65]You read the file, right?
[77:29.49]We've lost three tactical operatives in the last three weeks.
[77:32.43]Yeah, just gone.
[77:33.91]Like that.
[77:35.23]J-T-E-G.
[77:35.93]This guy's a crap out of me.
[77:42.02]I really hope this is not one of those where if I fail, it's over.
[77:46.34]Good luck.
[77:48.58]Okay.
[77:53.99]And let's see.
[77:54.55]When do I get control?
[77:55.03]Because of the losses, we've gone to a battle cam set up.
[77:58.56]The town is rigged for picture.
[78:00.28]It's your eyes and ears at four critical locations.
[78:03.32]It's going to be another fucking camera game.
[78:04.70]It's going to be a camera game.
[78:06.94]Your fire control center consists of four particle beam disruptors with limited energy capacitors.
[78:11.73]You're going to have to trap the aliens.
[78:12.85]We're in here.
[78:20.70]I'm gonna have to trap the aliens with my camera.
[78:22.48]Based on cell analysis, HQ has determined that these aliens must ingest a compatible life form in order to survive.
[78:28.74]Their constant cellular regeneration depends on it.
[78:31.88]No.
[78:33.56]Frankly, our best weapons can only stun these creeps.
[78:37.87]You gotta find a way to stop them.
[78:39.73]Five nights at Freddy's in downtown Texas.
[78:42.37]Now, there'll be an agent in each locale, and you'll get a wave once you get set.
[78:45.99]Oh, God.
[78:46.61]I'll be on the street as well, gathering what intelligence I can on the disappearances.
[78:51.33]Now you're supposedly the best we've got.
[78:53.45]And we're counting on you to watch our backs and be there in the event that something goes wrong.
[78:58.67]Yeah.
[79:00.31]And there's one other thing.
[79:02.92]You're the last chance we have.
[79:04.76]This is the same actor from the other game too.
[79:07.34]HQ has a B-2 in the air with attack nuke.
[79:10.58]They're ready to drop it.
[79:13.12]So this game, it's the same engine for every single one of these games.
[79:19.68]Okay, top secret accessing battle cam.
[79:24.04]Piecing together, using like the... Using the 3D Studio Max.
[79:30.05]One, two, three, four.
[79:35.49]They're really dragging this out.
[79:38.55]So I can shoot with these traps.
[79:40.57]Okay.
[79:40.91]Go to three.
[79:46.73]No input received.
[79:48.51]Session will be terminated in three seconds.
[79:51.94]Look, okay.
[79:53.76]Select camera is A. For camera shield is B and fire weapon is C. Okay.
[80:00.52]Got it.
[80:02.77]I didn't get it.
[80:15.28]Restart level one, please.
[80:24.62]It's like reading the disc very, very harshly.
[80:27.47]Okay.
[80:29.15]It's A in a direction.
[80:31.51]No, I don't want to see the build the dumb thing.
[80:34.35]What's going on?
[80:34.73]Okay.
[80:36.95]C is shoot the gun, right?
[80:40.12]Oh, shit.
[80:40.70]Okay.
[80:49.58]The chopper's waiting!
[80:59.74]You're done!
[81:00.68]Is Hulkamania the fucking door down?
[81:07.36]Let's restart the level again.
[81:09.80]Let's go.
[81:14.83]That guy is... That guy is strong, for sure.
[81:18.80]Alright, let's go to the fucking Plaza Square.
[81:20.94]No fucking wrong.
[81:21.78]Let's shoot the right alien.
[81:24.64]Shoot the right bad guy.
[81:31.41]Find the alien.
[81:34.23]I have to find the alien.
[81:36.83]This is so hard.
[81:39.97]Guys, I don't think you understand how fucking difficult this is.
[81:42.41]To, like, use this.
[81:45.07]I'm never gonna win.
[81:48.17]I won.
[81:49.71]How am I... Gotta go to one.
[81:54.03]Gotta go to one.
[81:57.41]Alien.
[81:58.57]Where's the alien?
[82:06.10]I gotta go back to three.
[82:06.86]Back to three.
[82:07.18]Back to three.
[82:07.58]Back to three.
[82:07.90]I don't care what you have to say.
[82:08.76]Fuck you.
[82:09.12]This town still needs to be attacked.
[82:12.34]That's like shot like Will Ferrell.
[82:17.72]Holy shit, this is fucking unbelievably difficult.
[82:20.02]I have to stay like on one plane.
[82:24.30]Didn't get it.
[82:29.22]I go back up.
[82:31.44]What's going on here?
[82:36.93]Hot tacos.
[82:37.75]Oh, come on now.
[82:40.03]Everybody does the exact same death animation.
[82:48.46]Anybody at three?
[82:49.18]Three is okay still.
[82:55.43]Four is now in trouble.
[82:57.95]Down to four.
[83:07.66]This is so dumb.
[83:11.34]Don't you ever walk up in front of somebody that's aiming a gun out of the window.
[83:17.05]Was she just holding an ice cream?
[83:23.57]Was that a fucking ice cream sandwich?
[83:30.44]Texas Feed Tech.
[83:33.36]Two is now in trouble.
[83:34.42]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[83:37.85]You gotta stay in the middle.
[83:38.55]It's just like whack-a-mole.
[83:39.95]You guys ever played whack-a-mole before?
[83:41.13]You have to stay in the middle.
[83:42.17]And, like, right when the thing comes out, you go and shoot it.
[83:45.38]Two?
[83:48.52]Just keep a cool head, and you'll get through this.
[83:53.34]That's the strategy.
[83:53.88]You have to stay in the middle.
[83:56.40]Things look normal enough around here.
[83:59.22]Let me tell you.
[83:59.80]A lot of people disappeared.
[84:03.59]Yeah.
[84:04.67]Okay.
[84:08.60]I was about to shoot this guy right in the face, but he's not gonna have any... Hold on.
[84:12.80]Right in the middle.
[84:15.76]I clearly shot that guy.
[84:16.88]You all saw that.
[84:17.52]That was bullshit.
[84:25.77]How much health do I have?
[84:28.51]You know, I'm also convinced it's the same fucking actor, by the way.
[84:35.24]It's like two actors doing this.
[84:39.35]Damn it Yeah, by the way what that guy's accent was a very thick East Coast accent What the hell is that guy doing down here?
[84:58.53]Down to four So at what point does this game end?
[85:14.64]I keep taking hits, but thankfully it's not doing very much.
[85:19.86]That's so hard to go up with like two planes.
[85:27.35]That guy had an elaborate death more than anybody else.
[85:29.43]Over to three.
[85:34.32]Also, this music is terrible too.
[85:36.28]Oh no.
[85:36.76]This is not good.
[85:38.87]Two is in trouble.
[85:40.79]And the screen is dodgy.
[85:41.65]Alright, that lighting just got knocked over by a gust of wind.
[85:51.80]What?
[85:53.16]I don't want the likes of you watching my back!
[85:56.40]The chopper's waiting!
[85:57.46]You're done!
[86:11.45]I can put it, apparently I can put a shield on.
[86:18.18]All right, let's do another one.
[86:21.94]That was definitely worth doing just for the guy fucking breaking the door down.
[86:29.97]What else we got?
[86:31.13]Oh, we got, oh, don't worry.
[86:32.55]We got lots more.
[86:36.91]Like this one.
[86:41.17]This one is called Midnight Raiders.
[86:49.38]Midnight Raiders.
[87:00.08]Hey.
[87:01.60]If this was another trap game, I swear to God.
[87:04.59]We were just playing a glorified trap game, by the way.
[87:12.33]Thank you all.
[87:13.65]I didn't miss anybody.
[87:17.00]Emperor William, thanks for the two bucks.
[87:18.42]The four bucks, actually.
[87:19.32]Tub Tucker, thank you for the bits.
[87:22.08]It's Real Bob, thank you for the bits.
[87:23.56]Glazed Donut, thank you for the bits.
[87:26.40]Jason Dartson, the Real Bob again.
[87:27.90]Zach2540 for the bits.
[87:29.80]Five dollars.
[87:32.69]What is happening here, by the way?
[87:38.33]It's just a series of noises.
[87:40.89]I think the game crashed.
[87:45.92]Uh... This game, uh... I think this game might be toast.
[87:54.90]The CD's just damaged.
[87:56.50]Oh, shit.
[87:57.26]Hold on.
[87:57.62]Now I can hear it, like, trying to spin.
[88:00.50]Give me a second.
[88:01.47]Let's take a look.
[88:07.29]Oh, this CD sure is fucked up on the bottom.
[88:11.55]Let's try this again.
[88:12.29]Yeah, there is quite a bit of damage on this CD.
[88:18.23]Let's see if it works.
[88:21.40]Don't you guys worry.
[88:22.22]There are plenty more fucking games to play.
[88:26.14]We might not even be able to get through them all tonight.
[88:31.38]Let's try again.
[88:33.72]Come on, run.
[88:38.44]Run, dude.
[88:45.86]Shit.
[88:49.47]God damn it.
[88:49.95]This one could have been funny, too.
[88:53.89]Ah.
[88:58.05]Oh, well.
[88:59.97]Sorry.
[89:00.45]Time to move on to the next one.
[89:12.16]This one is... This one was advertised, like, three different times.
[89:15.50]Here we go.
[89:18.56]And... There it is.
[89:22.51]And turn it on.
[89:26.25]I swear to God, if I get any more disc errors... Sonic CD?
[89:31.41]I do not have Sonic CD.
[89:33.99]Ow!
[89:34.13]Why would I want to play Sonic CD?

[90:35.40]John Madden.
[90:38.13]Wait, you play real games?
[90:39.93]Come on, give me like a... I just beat all of Red Dead Redemption like fucking last week.
[90:45.36]I played Red Dead Redemption, which is like a good game.
[90:47.84]I beat the whole fucking thing.
[90:49.07]So we're playing a bunch of shitty Night Trap games, like tonight.
[90:54.41]Give me a break.
[90:58.25]I just beat all of Red Dead Redemption on Nickelodeon.
[91:03.18]Alright, let's see what this one entails.
[91:13.89]This is a- this is just a boxing game, by the way, guys.
[91:16.91]I don't think there's anything special about this.
[91:22.15]It might be- Okay, I'm done.
[91:26.88]Get- So I'm the kid, alright.
[91:28.96]Which one of these reporters am I punching in the face?
[91:41.64]Is that fucking fat Gilbert Godfrey?
[91:47.46]He begged me to bring him.
[91:49.40]He always wanted to be a boxer.
[91:51.78]Until the tragedy.
[91:53.44]Wait for me, Mr. Kid.
[91:54.94]Tragedy?
[91:55.51]Come on, come on, kid.
[91:56.23]Let's go.
[91:56.89]Watch it, please.
[91:57.83]Let us in, please.
[91:58.95]Come on, come on, come on.
[91:59.93]That was like fucking, you know, actually pretty dark.
[92:01.87]All right, here we go.
[92:06.57]Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
[92:08.99]Tonight, we have four of the biggest and baddest, fiercest and meanest fighters this side of Thermonuclear War.
[92:21.18]Okay, I just kind of zoned out for a second.
[92:23.32]He just said it's this Thermonuclear War.
[92:29.03]C for options.
[92:30.71]I love how this is like a fucking, this is like in the Harry Potter universe, apparently.
[92:35.39]Living newspapers.
[92:36.31]All right.
[92:36.61]So 190 pounds, 703 power points.
[92:41.97]And I'm the kid.
[92:44.35]C for options.
[92:46.13]Power points, save game, restore game, delete game, control changes, training mode.
[92:50.82]Should I do the training mode?
[92:52.80]I think I should put on the training wheels.
[92:54.50]Training mode on.
[92:57.68]Okay.
[92:58.96]I don't know how to play though.
[92:59.84]You better be ready for me, punk.
[93:04.94]I turned on the training, so there we go.
[93:06.58]I think I forgot his lines.
[93:33.21]These are the rules.
[93:34.59]No rabbit punches, no low blows.
[93:36.55]In case of a knockdown, go to a neutral corner.
[93:40.13]And stay there.
[93:40.49]What's a rabbit punch?
[93:41.49]I tell you to come out.
[93:43.01]Is that clear?
[93:43.53]Have a good fight.
[93:46.88]Why is everybody talking so down to me?
[93:48.28]This is it, kid.
[93:48.94]Let's do it.
[93:49.46]I'm supposed to do the tutorial.
[93:55.06]What's the tutorial?
[93:55.90]Does them tell me no rabbit punches?
[94:03.78]Alright, let's play.
[94:06.20]A rabbit punch is a punch in the back of the head.
[94:23.98]Alright, now watch me have a bunch of cameras to like drop people down.
[94:29.58]Is that me?
[94:30.02]I think that's me.
[94:33.48]Why is this recorded on my old VCR?
[94:35.30]Because this game came out during the period of the VCR.
[94:40.42]That's why.
[94:45.14]Round one, round one.
[94:47.69]They're really setting this up.
[94:52.63]Alright, let's go.
[94:57.23]There's the bell.
[94:57.95]The fight starts now.
[95:04.40]Oh, alright, apparently that's it.
[95:08.56]Whoa, okay.
[95:21.71]This is different.
[95:24.83]Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[95:28.79]Hey, get off me.
[95:38.19]What?
[95:38.41]I don't understand.
[95:39.03]What does it want me to do?
[95:43.23]None of us have hit each other in like at least a few minutes.
[95:48.91]Lehigh, at least it's at 60 FPS.
[95:53.35]That's a good thing, right?
[95:54.47]So that's a right punch.
[95:59.47]Dude, I... It's giving me these on-screen prompts.
[96:06.00]And I don't know if any of these things are working.
[96:11.75]I wish this guy would get the fuck off me.
[96:13.83]I mean, this is a kind of cool idea back in the day, but... I got him.
[96:23.50]I punched him.
[96:28.74]I guess at Tate, you just kind of have to get it in the right spot.
[96:33.64]I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[96:34.67]I really am.
[96:40.52]Dude, the on-screen prompts don't really make any sense.
[96:42.26]Is it like the fucking gut punch sound?
[96:47.45]Am I on the ground?
[96:52.93]Oh my god.
[96:58.60]Yeah, is that like blood?
[96:59.62]Alright, go.
[97:08.95]I think I understand.
[97:09.87]Yeah, I get it.
[97:11.25]I think I get it now.
[97:13.75]Yep.
[97:17.37]It's up and down, too.
[97:22.91]He's kind of fucked up right now.
[97:23.87]I'm going to knock him down.
[97:25.58]Last punch.
[97:25.98]Right in the face.
[97:26.38]Come on.
[97:30.82]Come on.
[97:31.12]Get him knocked down.
[97:33.74]He just went for a haymaker.
[97:34.76]How did none of those land?
[97:41.04]How are none of these punches hitting this guy?
[97:51.53]Apparently my arms cannot reach this guy's face.
[97:55.81]There, I got it.
[97:56.35]I got him in the stomach one time.
[97:58.01]Great play!
[98:14.94]Okay.
[98:16.34]I guess I went down again.
[98:17.38]That's the round.
[98:37.58]Well, alright.
[98:38.54]That was pretty good.
[98:39.22]So, uh...
[98:46.78]There's arrows on the screen.
[98:48.52]I asked for the tutorial and I just didn't get it.
[98:51.84]They didn't give it to me.
[98:52.92]Fuck you, lady.
[98:55.33]I need to listen.
[98:58.29]This is my dodge.
[99:20.31]It's always like... I hit him once.
[99:31.24]I'm trying to figure out things to say right now, but I have nothing to say.
[99:34.56]This is not like Punch-Out.
[99:39.25]Punch-Out is a way better game.
[99:40.37]That came out in 1996 too, didn't it?
[99:49.38]I wish he would stop grabbing me.
[99:50.50]Alright, we're just gonna fucking spam every button.
[100:00.63]That's how you do it.
[100:01.17]You spam every button, you just jab him in the face over and over again.
[100:03.34]Eventually he's gonna go down.
[100:12.01]He favors his left hand so much.
[100:13.94]Dodge right.
[100:16.36]What?
[100:23.94]Imagine playing this game.
[100:25.58]Well, you don't have to imagine.
[100:26.62]I'm here.
[100:26.90]Dude, this is not right.
[100:36.91]Okay, he just did an off-the-ropes fucking clothesline.
[100:45.10]I like that the screen's going dark.
[100:52.99]Okay, I'm fucking almost done with this shit.
[101:01.60]Okay, this might be the worst game of the whole night.
[101:07.06]Fuck this.
[101:09.00]I'm not gonna... No, I don't want to keep doing this.
[101:23.54]Why won't my punches hit him?
[101:25.94]He's, like, right in range.
[101:27.06]I can't fucking hit this guy.
[101:28.20]He doesn't, like, take punches.
[101:29.36]He just comes in and grabs you.
[101:30.46]I can knock him out.
[101:36.98]Man, the kid's not gonna stay down for long.
[101:53.89]Here comes the next one.
[101:56.55]That gives no rhyme or reason to that fucking game.
[101:58.48]Alright, the next one that I want to play is upstairs.
[102:08.15]I forgot it.
[102:08.65]It's upstairs.
[102:09.15]Give me one second.
[102:09.67]I'll be right back.
[102:10.33]I'm going to go grab it.
[104:06.71]Okay.
[104:07.51]We're back.
[104:11.11]This time we're playing... This one I think is the one that I wanted to... I wanted to play this one the most.
[104:17.53]By far.
[104:19.19]This is a game called Wirehead.
[104:24.65]This is the whole reason for the stream besides Night Trap.
[104:28.77]So pray that this game is fun because this is the fucking reason why I wanted to do it.
[104:44.93]Wirehead.
[104:46.55]Indicator on.
[104:48.19]That's fine, I'm going to assume.
[104:53.72]Here we go.
[104:56.24]Pray this game is fun.
[105:10.57]Touch TV production.
[105:11.89]Wirehead.
[105:18.49]What's this fucking video?
[105:22.03]Oh shit, dad's dead.
[105:26.44]Package for Ned Hubbard.
[105:27.80]That's me.
[105:28.24]They're controlling dad with their game gear.
[105:40.03]You guys have any idea how this is gonna be fucking fun?
[105:46.53]I told you kids not to play with your father's controller.
[105:49.26]Yeah, you controlled dad with your fucking Genesis controller.
[105:57.14]Hey, thanks for the package.
[105:58.02]Kids.
[106:07.75]That was pretty impressive, though.
[106:08.81]Dad doing like three back handsprings.
[106:11.87]Let's put in a VHS.
[106:19.05]Ned, I don't know how to say this.
[106:22.50]They've tortured me.
[106:24.10]They've killed my nurse.
[106:26.04]And now they're after you.
[106:28.32]I escaped.
[106:29.88]But I don't know how long before they find me.
[106:31.88]It's just an episode of Black Mirror.
[106:34.26]I've got to go.
[106:35.48]I'll be getting in touch with you very soon.
[106:38.12]In the meantime, I've got someone watching over you with my controller.
[106:42.74]It's me.
[106:43.50]I'm watching you.
[106:44.24]I love how I've just been in this guy's house and he doesn't even notice that I'm here.
[106:50.39]Mr. Ned Hubbard?
[106:51.73]Yes.
[106:52.59]My name is Frank Ross.
[106:53.91]This is my partner, Will Kramer.
[106:55.63]We're with the FBI.
[106:57.72]Uh-oh.
[106:57.94]I'm not going with the FBI.
[106:58.84]Uh-huh.
[106:59.02]Adrenaline surge detected.
[106:59.78]Hyperventilating.
[107:00.36]Remote control activated.
[107:01.26]Go.
[107:01.54]Go right.
[107:02.20]Here they come.
[107:28.23]Straight.
[107:30.29]That was the Bluetooth in my ear.
[107:31.79]Out the back door.
[107:32.63]Where did he come from?
[107:38.17]That doesn't seem like a very... What?
[107:46.70]What's going on?
[107:48.72]How did that guy get all the way out here?
[107:57.62]I lost again.
[107:58.26]Alright, well... Looks like we're disconnected again.
[108:07.38]So this time we're gonna go left.
[108:09.06]Left.
[108:11.76]Okay, good.
[108:12.16]He fell.
[108:13.26]Not straight this time.
[108:13.92]We're gonna go left this time.
[108:14.64]Left.
[108:16.50]Out the window.
[108:18.86]Good job.
[108:21.98]You couldn't do that any fucking slower.
[108:23.86]Are you serious?
[108:26.39]Are you a toddler?
[108:28.09]You can't get out the fucking window.
[108:33.97]Hopes fade for wirehead.
[108:35.45]Wait, that's it?
[108:36.15]There they come.
[108:40.01]Okay, looks like we have to go straight.
[108:41.23]Up the stairs.
[108:41.59]I love how that guy dives every time.
[108:45.50]That's a stuntman for sure.
[108:46.48]Now he slipped on a fucking tennis ball.
[108:48.26]This is...
[108:52.99]There's only one fucking way you can go.
[108:54.85]Why is this guy such a fucking klutz?
[109:01.73]This is just Mario Maker.
[109:05.29]Alright, uh... Left.
[109:11.05]And then right or straight?
[109:12.61]I don't understand.
[109:13.33]Which way?
[109:15.52]Right.
[109:18.38]Through the back door.
[109:19.42]Into the bedroom.
[109:22.16]Left.
[109:30.41]We have to get out of the fucking house, okay?
[109:32.47]Like, eventually, we're just gonna... It's just trial and error.
[109:38.17]Right.
[109:42.37]Alright, let's just... Spray.
[109:45.97]We're going out the door again.
[109:48.43]He's gonna grab me in a fucking headlock again.
[109:50.03]He's gonna say, Hey, I got you.
[109:51.60]What's going on here?
[110:01.83]Wirehead's brutal twist of fate.
[110:05.89]How many more times do I- can I please get out of the fucking house?
[110:10.83]So I don't go- I have to go right, and then right again.
[110:14.22]Right.
[110:14.46]That's right again.
[110:16.34]That's the only other way.
[110:23.70]It's just- it's just the other door to the outside, by the way, guys.
[110:27.37]Straight.
[110:28.87]I'm getting on the fucking little kid's bicycle.
[110:34.33]Why wouldn't I get in the car?
[110:37.39]Dead in the fucking car.
[110:38.67]Why would you get on the little kid's bike?
[110:40.43]Alright, we're gonna go left.
[110:49.40]Okay, we're gonna do it.
[110:50.66]We're gonna take a right up here.
[110:55.64]Okay, this time, go out the right door, not the left door, because it matters.
[111:02.31]Out here.
[111:02.85]Instead of going straight, we're gonna hit right.
[111:04.11]Alright.
[111:06.55]Oh, right.
[111:07.27]Again.
[111:09.21]This time, get in the car.
[111:11.07]You fucking moron.
[111:12.47]Back over the guy.
[111:17.52]Do I have to control the car?
[111:20.26]I got blocked in.
[111:20.96]Okay, um... Put it in... What are you doing?
[111:26.02]What were you thinking?
[111:27.61]You were gonna make a getaway in a family wagon?
[111:30.58]Put it in fucking drive, dude!
[111:32.28]This guy, nobody has any guns!
[111:37.88]Honest to god, these guys don't have weapons.
[111:40.41]Just drive over them.
[111:41.93]Smash into the fucking car!
[111:46.65]Why is this guy so inept at everything?
[111:51.75]So what, I would have to get on like the skateboard?
[111:54.32]So the car is not the correct option.
[111:56.64]It's the skateboard.
[112:01.62]No, fuck it.
[112:02.36]I'm gonna get tackled.
[112:07.18]Apparently that was the right thing to do.
[112:12.71]Okay, I think we've lost.
[112:18.07]Fleeing Professor Snatch skateboarder terrorizes neighborhood?
[112:24.42]That's not what happened.
[112:27.98]That is absolutely not what happened.
[112:36.26]Alright, well, we know how to get there.
[112:38.34]You didn't think we were gonna fucking beat this game?
[112:41.84]You guys didn't think we were gonna beat this fucking entire game?
[112:46.96]We're getting to the very end of this game.
[112:48.39]I knew this one was a keeper.
[112:50.59]Right.
[112:52.27]Skateboard, then left.
[112:53.57]That's what I'm gonna say.
[112:57.93]Yep, out the store.
[112:58.89]We still have full battery power.
[113:03.00]Get on the fucking scrape board.
[113:04.76]And then left.
[113:06.18]We're going to bang a left because he pulls in front of us.
[113:10.14]I'm sure left or right will work.
[113:12.60]Left.
[113:14.74]Nice.
[113:17.86]Are they following me on the road?
[113:19.42]Right.
[113:24.16]Wait, how do I have control in the air?
[113:25.86]How did I have...
[113:33.45]What?
[113:33.99]I... Oh, good, we got a big... No, shit!
[113:44.39]Hold on.
[113:47.81]No, no, wait, wait, wait.
[113:48.87]I didn't know we were gonna start from the beginning like that.
[113:51.49]Left.
[113:52.68]Left.
[113:54.50]Holy shit, this guy sucks.
[113:58.56]Get up.
[114:00.17]Oh.
[114:00.51]My.
[114:00.87]God.
[114:04.48]So we have to go straight.
[114:11.64]Wirehead loses his head.
[114:12.84]Gah, that's fine.
[114:14.00]Straight.
[114:16.26]No!
[114:16.60]Why is it starting me from here?
[114:17.90]It started me from the other point last time!
[114:20.62]Oh.
[114:20.80]My.
[114:21.44]Fucking.
[114:21.86]God.
[114:23.50]Left, and then straight.
[114:27.92]Straight.
[114:31.33]There we go.
[114:33.45]Right.
[114:35.37]Nice.
[114:37.87]Are we good?
[114:40.27]I'm not gonna be able to memorize this shit.
[114:41.81]Oh shit, old lady with groceries.
[114:44.23]Straight.
[114:44.71]Fucking just crash into her.
[114:45.87]Who cares?
[114:46.37]Fuck her.
[114:47.47]Alright, I stole her like fucking Oreos.
[114:58.74]This is just trial and error, the video game.
[115:03.76]This is so stupid.
[115:05.32]I don't remember the inputs, by the way.
[115:06.80]I don't remember.
[115:07.26]Where's it gonna put me?
[115:10.24]Right.
[115:11.88]Lady with the groceries.
[115:13.00]Ram into her.
[115:18.32]Straight into her.
[115:21.12]And then we gotta go right.
[115:22.14]Right.
[115:22.44]Nice.
[115:23.18]Around it.
[115:32.11]I just dropped, like, eggs on somebody.
[115:33.49]Okay, I went left.
[115:34.43]Watch out for the guys holding the couch.
[115:37.49]I'm gonna go right.
[115:38.13]I just got run over by a car.
[115:46.53]This is a... This is a skateboard and terrorizes a neighborhood.
[115:53.79]I... I don't... I...
[116:01.86]Should I just drive into the guys carrying the couch?
[116:03.90]I don't remember.
[116:06.89]I don't remember.
[116:07.61]It's so hard to keep track of all these fucking times to move.
[116:12.81]And it was... Right.
[116:15.73]Through the lady with the groceries.
[116:17.65]And then right.
[116:18.64]And then through the guys with the couch.
[116:23.06]Straight through.
[116:26.00]Righty!
[116:30.58]Then he spills the eggs, we go right, and then I'm gonna go straight for the guys on the couch.
[116:38.11]Wait, what?
[116:43.09]No!
[116:45.05]What the fuck?
[116:46.47]What?
[116:46.81]Dude, I hit... Oh my fucking god.
[117:03.38]I just pressed left and it didn't work.
[117:09.34]I gotta remember this too.
[117:11.19]I did it wrong already.
[117:12.75]Maybe I didn't.
[117:21.73]Yeah, I didn't.
[117:24.91]Focus on the task.
[117:26.07]Dude, it's just guess.
[117:33.77]I literally just have to memorize the entire fucking game.
[117:36.89]Left, right, up, left, right, right, left, right, left, right.
[117:38.99]I'm not going to be able to do that shit.
[117:43.11]That's, like, absurd.
[117:51.54]Skateboard, yeah.
[117:53.46]It's not straight, right?
[117:54.34]Is it left or right?
[117:55.62]I think it's left.
[117:59.68]It's never explained why they're even after you in the first place.
[118:04.16]Am I good?
[118:04.56]And then, I don't remember.
[118:06.42]I think it's straight.
[118:08.12]No, it's not.
[118:09.44]Yes, it is.
[118:11.51]Right?
[118:13.07]Okay.
[118:14.65]Here comes the lady with the groceries.
[118:17.89]And then it's left.
[118:19.85]Or is it left or is it right?
[118:22.35]After the groceries, is it right?
[118:25.97]It's right after the groceries.
[118:32.12]There go the eggs.
[118:33.70]And it's right?
[118:35.42]Fuck!
[118:37.32]It's not right!
[118:41.74]Oh god dammit.
[118:44.04]Whoa!
[118:47.88]Oh my fucking god.
[118:55.64]It's left after eggs?
[118:56.82]That's what I just did?
[118:57.58]Why is it putting me back here?! !
[119:02.88]I just landed in this lady's car.
[119:06.32]What the fuck?
[119:10.84]Why did I land in her car this time?
[119:22.49]I don't have control of the car.
[119:24.75]So, well, how... This is the secret ending, yeah.
[119:28.55]Well, this is the actual way to do it.
[119:35.87]Alright, we lost him.
[119:36.70]Good.
[119:38.86]On to mission two.
[119:47.10]I guess I'm still being chased.
[119:49.36]I'm going right.
[119:51.54]Go to the police officer and ask for help.
[119:54.32]What?
[119:58.07]Did I just go into the fucking security check?
[120:04.28]Wouldn't I be like, wait, and now I'm on a fucking airplane?
[120:14.65]What are you doing in here?
[120:15.91]I was just making sure my bags got on the plane.
[120:18.89]No one is allowed in this room, sir.
[120:20.57]Now, I suggest you take your seat with me.
[120:22.98]Right away.
[120:27.82]I did like a baseball slide into home plate through security and I'm just on the plane.
[120:32.81]That shit don't work anymore.
[120:37.77]What was once like a funny joke like fucking 30 years ago.
[120:42.65]That ain't gonna fly anymore, buddy.
[120:44.48]Go there.
[120:53.20]Thank you, Steady.
[120:53.98]Steady to shoot for the 15 bucks.
[120:56.68]This is the best game so far.
[120:59.58]Awesome stream.
[121:00.10]Thanks for the laughs.
[121:01.18]I told you this one was gonna be good.
[121:02.60]Thank you, though.
[121:03.20]Appreciate it.
[121:04.18]Did it just say I was getting, like, turned on?
[121:23.50]Yeah, I was just getting, like, turned on.
[121:24.98]I was sitting next to a fat man back there who snores like a water buffalo.
[121:29.25]All right, left, right, or straight?
[121:30.55]I don't know.
[121:31.13]You guys pick the next one.
[121:31.93]You're not going to believe this.
[121:34.73]What?
[121:35.01]Airport security's just called.
[121:36.69]They think we might have a murderer on board.
[121:39.72]My name is Frances Mars, and yours?

[122:05.69]Oh, no.
[122:06.49]No, I... Oh, God.
[122:09.29]It's going to be left.
[122:10.17]We're going to go left.
[122:11.09]That's the predetermined way we're going to go.
[122:13.99]We're on an airplane, by the way.
[122:15.09]Where am I supposed to go?
[122:17.63]Exit is to the right.
[122:18.51]Let's hide in here.
[122:20.69]I don't trust her.
[122:21.33]We're going right.
[122:25.94]I can't jump out of a plane!
[122:28.38]I can't!
[122:32.49]Hold on, did the lady just... Hold on, it worked.
[122:44.98]It fucking worked?
[122:48.04]It actually worked.
[122:54.82]Left.
[122:55.32]You just do the doggy paddle, you'll get out of there.
[123:01.04]He turned the boat into a parachute and landed in the water, and now I'm safe.
[123:04.52]This game's fucking unbelievable.
[123:06.16]We have to play this game like four more times through.
[123:11.95]Oh, well now.
[123:13.17]Lookie here.
[123:13.87]Look who just popped out of the sky.
[123:15.49]We've been looking for you, sonny.
[123:16.73]Right this way.
[123:17.95]Come on now.
[123:18.71]Grab his gun.
[123:19.13]Don't give me any trouble.
[123:20.28]Now what?
[123:21.60]Come on.
[123:22.64]That's it.
[123:23.10]What?
[123:24.34]Okay, so don't go.
[123:25.24]Don't go left.
[123:26.84]Whoa!
[123:29.83]Am I gonna get on?
[123:31.25]I'm just a guy that- You lose!
[123:32.11]What?
[123:32.27]Alright, we're just fucking going over the waterfall.
[123:37.23]Screw it.
[123:38.45]If there's police here, they're looking for me.
[123:41.19]That's great.
[123:42.13]Am I okay?
[123:44.19]Oh, okay.
[123:45.43]This guy is so lucky.
[123:59.48]Climb up it.
[124:00.22]Climb up.
[124:01.80]You can do it.
[124:03.26]Just shimmy your weight up there.
[124:09.11]I guess that didn't fucking do it.
[124:10.31]Should I go down?
[124:13.57]God.
[124:17.57]This guy can't even walk up the stairs correctly, but he can somehow float to the surface.
[124:23.01]He has the amount of strength to hold on to that the whole fucking time.
[124:28.59]Thanks, man.
[124:30.17]I love how this guy needs somebody with a controller in their hand to tell him what to do.
[124:40.06]It's just such simple tasks like walk or like turn.
[124:43.94]All right, let's go just slide down it.
[124:46.78]Let's shimmy down.
[124:47.44]Oh, God, dude.
[124:53.55]Well, it's not down.
[124:56.53]It's not down.
[124:57.49]Waterlogged wire head jumps a thousand feet falls.
[125:00.62]Okay.
[125:03.02]Oh, shit.
[125:03.66]Alright, we're gonna try this one differently this time.
[125:06.42]Should I?
[125:07.76]Let's hide in there.
[125:11.12]We're gonna see the other outcomes.
[125:12.12]Oh.
[125:12.76]Oh, my fucking god.
[125:13.46]Don't take your clothes off.
[125:17.45]Let...
[125:26.58]they've just both broke the foot because she's a huge knife let's hide in here oh well yeah I guess we're jumping out the door well we found the murderer it's the lady with the gigantic knife
[125:55.35]So, yeah, we have to go left or right.
[125:59.15]Go down the waterfall, then go left.
[126:00.23]We'll try that.
[126:01.37]Or right.
[126:01.83]We're gonna try right.
[126:05.43]Hey!
[126:05.65]You're good!
[126:06.76]We've heard a lot of that.
[126:15.68]Let's try right.
[126:19.08]Where'd the raft come from?
[126:19.94]That's like the emergency slide for the plane.
[126:23.96]Right.
[126:27.74]I just said right.
[126:30.66]That's all he had to do.
[126:36.27]That was a barrel.
[126:37.87]Wait, I made it all the way... Heh!
[126:59.52]Dude, his turn to the camera was just like, oh, I'm in some trouble here.
[127:07.20]That was just two people in a fucking bear costume.
[127:11.71]How did they film that?
[127:20.62]That was a fucking trained professional.
[127:25.89]That person actually was getting, like, grabbed and bit by a bear.
[127:29.47]That was a real bear.
[127:30.69]This is back in the fucking, like, 90s, dude.
[127:32.89]That was no CGI bullshit.
[127:35.07]That was a real bear killing a guy on camera.
[127:44.49]Left.
[127:50.93]Wait, this is different.
[127:52.23]This is different.
[127:55.50]Oh, shit, it's over.
[128:07.68]Multiple takes.
[128:11.94]Oh, my God.
[128:13.80]I'm not stopping this game.
[128:15.62]I don't care what anybody says.
[128:16.62]We're staying on this.
[128:17.62]We have to get to the end.
[128:20.02]I just have to remember fucking half these things.
[128:23.32]Let's go.
[128:25.32]Okay, it's left.
[128:28.64]Going back this far.
[128:29.52]Oh, come on.
[128:30.80]I can't blow this.
[128:37.91]And then it's right again.
[128:39.49]Skateboard.
[128:42.11]It really is too good to stop.
[128:43.45]We have to win.
[128:46.99]I love how the skateboard is very clearly lit up.
[128:50.72]And bright.
[128:52.30]And then it's left.
[128:53.00]I think it's left.
[128:55.64]This part confuses me every time, man.
[128:57.18]I just gotta fly off and land in her car.
[129:02.02]Okay.
[129:03.44]There we go.
[129:04.80]Fly off.
[129:05.84]Into her car.
[129:08.16]Got it.
[129:08.98]We got full fucking battery, too.
[129:10.54]Full battery.
[129:21.38]Dive through security.
[129:22.40]Every person you've ever seen play this game loves it.
[129:30.72]It's really something else.
[129:32.83]Well, it's just absurd.
[129:34.17]Yeah, we're good.
[129:41.03]Make sure we dive to the right.
[129:42.99]I mean, we could try a different avenue here.
[129:47.19]I'm going to try.
[129:47.81]You know, we know the security on the plane thing, but what about like straight through?
[129:50.61]What happens if I sprint in there?
[129:54.69]Straight in.
[129:55.07]Let's just try it.
[129:56.67]Whoa, whoa.
[129:58.25]Go down there, Phillip.
[129:59.17]What's the rush?
[129:59.88]Well, I'm trying to catch my flight.
[130:01.40]Hey!
[130:02.32]Congratulations, officer.
[130:04.06]You just captured a fugitive from the 10 Most Wanted list.
[130:06.96]I'm no fugitive.
[130:07.68]Thank you very much.
[130:08.66]We'll take it from here.
[130:10.04]Come on now.
[130:12.23]OK.
[130:14.86]without questions asked about.
[130:15.86]Alright, I just wanted to see what happened.
[130:18.12]Let's just dive into the security thing.
[130:21.76]Stick to the plan.
[130:22.53]I understand.
[130:23.93]Stick to the plan.
[130:27.07]Express check-in.
[130:27.79]There we go.
[130:32.51]Dive out the plane, then it's right, and then we're at the Baron.
[130:35.76]I don't know what to do.
[130:39.00]I think I can skip this, right?
[130:41.80]Yeah.
[130:47.43]I don't know what straight does.
[130:49.99]No time for that.
[130:50.61]Stick to the plan.
[130:53.83]I can't jump out of the frame.
[130:55.48]Danger, danger, danger this way.
[130:57.74]Here we go.
[130:59.48]Through the waterfall, here it comes.
[131:06.34]Whoa, here we go.
[131:16.74]Hey, you're good!
[131:19.54]I love his laugh.
[131:23.26]Alright, now we go right.
[131:31.66]We're at the bear.
[131:32.32]I'm gonna just try to run straight.
[131:36.15]No fucking around.
[131:36.85]We can outrun a bear.
[131:40.89]I'm pretty sure I can outrun a bear.
[131:43.49]Bears can only run like fucking 9 miles per hour.
[131:49.79]There you go.
[131:53.43]Run.
[131:53.97]No!
[131:54.33]I wanted to just run!
[131:59.83]Another death from the bear.
[132:02.38]We have to go down.
[132:05.42]The bear punched me in the face.
[132:13.62]That's three deaths from the bear.
[132:20.50]DSA to everyone, you cannot outrun a bear.
[132:33.03]Just give it like total false fucking knowledge.
[132:37.00]See, I better like preface that by saying there's no scientific evidence.
[132:40.58]I said that as a joke.
[132:41.52]Dude, if you see a bear, do not try to run away from it.
[132:45.45]Just throw a fucking handful of fucking snacks at it and then run.
[132:52.62]What the fuck am I doing?
[132:53.78]There you go, play dead.
[132:58.14]Don't do that either, by the way.
[132:59.46]That's a bad thing to do too, right?
[133:03.25]You gotta throw like... Throw like a fucking carton of Haagen-Dazs and then run.
[133:13.76]He's gone.
[133:16.66]Look at that artifacting on my back.
[133:19.02]That's something else.
[133:24.90]Okay, I got away from that situation.
[133:26.64]We're good.
[133:32.70]Where are we?
[133:35.80]Are we in the Wild West?
[133:40.86]How the fuck did we get to the Wild West?
[133:48.94]Where does this guy live?
[133:55.38]This is a pig?
[133:57.28]That pig was having sex with something.
[134:03.55]Alright, well, we're time traveling now, that's fine.
[134:08.93]None of these people here want to kill me, that's good.
[134:11.13]Fucking roosters are drinking booze.
[134:19.61]Oh, I just put a costume on.
[134:21.11]Okay.
[134:22.73]I'm playing the part now.
[134:25.92]Adrenaline surge detected.
[134:26.98]Remote control active.
[134:27.86]I just went right.
[134:34.32]Got it.
[134:35.44]Good.
[134:36.12]Just do it like Hitman.
[134:40.22]Straight, I guess, to the bar.
[134:43.15]Just like Hitman.
[134:43.79]You can just blend in.
[134:44.41]Oh.
[134:44.69]Oh.
[135:03.04]No, god damn it.
[135:04.39]We have to go all the way back to this shit.
[135:13.71]That killed me.
[135:14.95]He threw me over the bar and I died.
[135:16.43]Should I hit the wrong fucking button?
[135:29.66]I hit the wrong button.
[135:31.18]I was trying to...
[135:38.42]God, come on.
[135:42.76]Hey!
[135:43.58]You're good!
[135:45.24]No, I'm not.
[135:46.51]Waterfall!
[135:47.63]Help me out!
[135:48.71]So how do you survive that if you don't survive the... if you just jump up?
[135:57.56]How much did this game cost?
[135:58.60]This game I think was like 20 bucks.
[135:59.84]You're gonna help me!
[136:07.85]Maybe it was like 12, I don't remember.
[136:12.27]Down.
[136:12.71]I can't believe I didn't get a checkpoint.
[136:16.85]Well, this is so worth it.
[136:19.05]This is the best world we've played so far.
[136:22.35]This is easily worth like the $10 to $20 it was.
[136:25.15]And like the $150 fucking dollars it was for the Sega CD.
[136:27.59]Just for this, this was like $200.
[136:32.19]Just to play this on stream.
[136:38.19]It was worth it.
[136:39.19]Absolutely.
[136:45.50]I will own this forever.
[136:47.54]I own a physical copy of this game.
[136:49.24]Forever.
[136:49.60]In a case.
[136:50.82]Worth it.
[136:51.28]Alright, here we go.
[136:58.90]We can skip this.
[136:59.66]We go right.
[137:00.38]In the combo scene.
[137:05.97]And then we don't go straight, because that's the bar.
[137:08.93]Wait.
[137:11.61]So, okay, so now we walk by these guys.
[137:13.80]I'm going to say left.
[137:15.78]Talk to the chicken.
[137:19.34]Left.
[137:21.86]Howdy.
[137:22.64]Nice hat.
[137:23.60]Thank you.
[137:24.02]Where'd you get it?
[137:25.44]Oh, a store.
[137:26.46]General store.
[137:27.58]Looks awfully familiar to me.
[137:30.32]Sure does.
[137:31.20]Oh, yeah?
[137:32.32]Sure does.
[137:33.54]Sure does.
[137:34.54]Is this guy's hat?
[137:35.46]M-O-O-S-E.
[137:38.56]Moose.
[137:38.96]Oh, no.
[137:40.30]That's my hat.
[137:41.46]Combat program activated.
[137:42.82]You know what we do with hat wrestlers?
[137:48.12]No.
[137:52.94]I got punched.
[137:55.68]Okay, that's how you punch.
[137:58.62]And now I'm arrested.
[138:03.62]No, I'm not arrested.
[138:08.40]New mechanics, and I'm still alive.
[138:09.92]I'm still good.
[138:14.73]I punched the guy on the left for no reason.
[138:16.21]That's true.
[138:16.47]Good morning, Sheriff.
[138:18.01]I'm Laura Levin with the Times.
[138:19.91]Gentlemen, we have a very serious problem.
[138:22.69]Your prisoner here is accused of killing a man that he didn't kill.
[138:25.77]And the real killers are, in fact, on their way here this minute to kill him.
[138:29.53]Yeah, punch the guy in the face.
[138:31.57]The guy on the left was like chewing gum and I punched him.
[138:33.55]You cannot save in this game.
[138:34.63]This is going to be like an explosion here.
[138:36.21]Kill them all.
[138:36.83]Kill, kill, kill.
[138:37.29]I do have like a pretty good ending.
[138:59.72]How are you?
[139:01.01]I know who you are.
[139:01.97]I've met with Dr. Oha.
[139:03.23]He is safe, and he wants me to bring you to him now.
[139:06.25]But I don't even know where I am.
[139:07.33]Look, I don't have time to explain everything right now.
[139:10.37]Trust me.
[139:12.13]Act dehydrated.
[139:13.59]Act dehydrated?
[139:14.25]Excuse me.
[139:15.31]Gentlemen, are you trying to kill this man?
[139:17.55]He is going to die of dehydration.
[139:20.45]Dehydration?
[139:21.79]He's going to die of thirst.
[139:23.29]Please, do something for him.
[139:24.91]Great acting.
[139:25.59]Aw, hell, deputy.
[139:26.39]Get him a drink.
[139:27.58]Wait.
[139:29.04]Just hand it through.
[139:31.18]Hand a glass of water through the bars.
[139:33.02]What?
[139:34.40]He has to go in here?
[139:38.02]She just took the gun.
[139:38.88]Oh, no.
[139:39.02]Okay, so... Should I go straight?
[139:40.04]Should I punch?
[139:40.86]Holy shit, I was really dehydrated.
[139:57.86]I don't know which way to go here.
[139:59.16]I'm gonna say left.
[139:59.76]That was straight.
[140:07.32]I went straight.
[140:08.86]That was the right play.
[140:13.25]Take the other gun.
[140:13.95]Give me his gun.
[140:17.49]Why are you leaving the gun?
[140:18.51]Oh, for the love of God.
[140:28.33]Take the gun!
[140:31.13]Shit, dude.
[140:31.75]Okay, that was right... That was right straight.
[140:38.17]We made it out.
[140:39.01]Good.
[140:39.81]First try.
[140:42.77]Testosterone surge detected.
[140:45.21]Get in the fucking tank.
[140:49.68]That's not a tank!
[140:52.42]I thought this thing was a tank!
[140:53.54]It's like a fucking old shitty wagon!
[140:58.74]What the fuck?!
[141:00.66]Why would I get in this thing?!
[141:07.94]I can't even steer it!
[141:12.83]The video quality is so bad, I thought this was like a World War 2 tank!
[141:19.07]What do you want me to do?! !
[141:29.69]We're dead.
[141:30.43]We died.
[141:31.31]Alright, assess the choices.
[141:34.06]Let's get in the jeep.
[141:38.76]Is that a motorcycle there?
[141:42.26]Yeah, that's a motorcycle.
[141:43.32]That's the next choice.
[141:44.40]We don't find- we fuck this up.
[141:48.47]This is the- this is the safe play.
[141:50.67]For sure.
[142:00.93]I just hit left.
[142:03.97]I didn't... Okay.
[142:09.43]I went straight.
[142:13.67]Where do I go?
[142:14.69]Oh, God.
[142:24.02]Dude, I couldn't even see what the fuck... Prisoner killed while trying to escape.
[142:28.28]That's not true.
[142:29.59]Which way?
[142:30.05]Shit.
[142:30.83]That was very much alive.
[142:35.11]Let's get on the bike.
[142:40.94]We just drove into a little bit of wood.
[142:42.36]Why would that kill us?
[142:43.66]Don't ask me.
[142:44.12]I have no fucking idea.
[142:45.10]Let's take the bike.
[142:52.01]Let's take the jeep.
[142:53.97]Ned?
[142:55.09]What are you doing?
[142:56.37]Oh, Nir, we can't take this motorcycle.
[142:57.81]Grab a helmet.
[143:01.99]It's just a guessing game now, and we're gonna get to the beginning of the game.
[143:08.32]I don't know which choices are right.
[143:12.16]Here we go.
[143:15.76]I don't know.
[143:20.64]Straight.
[143:27.51]I used fucking series.
[143:33.75]You know what?
[143:34.35]Let's get back on the wagon.
[143:35.91]I really think the wagon was a good choice.
[143:41.33]Will I play the sequel?
[143:44.51]Is there a sequel to this game?
[143:48.40]You better believe I'll play the sequel.
[143:49.60]There actually is one.
[143:51.84]Take the tank.
[143:58.94]And then, I guess what I'm going to have to do is go right.
[144:02.84]Just don't crash.
[144:06.30]Just dive out or something.
[144:07.94]I can't steer.
[144:18.47]I don't think the wagon is correct because I went straight and then I went right.
[144:22.89]I don't know what to do here.
[144:25.15]Straight didn't work.
[144:27.00]I didn't pick something.
[144:27.74]She picked the Jeep automatically.
[144:34.20]I didn't have a chance.
[144:35.98]She did it.
[144:38.88]This is her last chance.
[144:45.89]I'm gonna listen to what she says this time.
[144:51.13]First thing I did was straight.
[144:52.09]Okay.
[145:00.71]She told me to go straight!
[145:03.50]She said, go straight.
[145:04.73]Get your hands right up now.
[145:10.53]You guys told me to listen to her.
[145:14.63]To go straight.
[145:16.03]And she got us fucking... We listened to her.
[145:22.12]She said, oh, great.
[145:26.58]She went, go straight.
[145:27.12]Go straight.
[145:32.62]What are you talking about?
[145:33.20]She didn't say right, she said go straight!
[145:39.89]We're doing it again.
[145:40.45]You think we're not doing this again?
[145:46.59]Don't trust her.
[145:57.00]At least we can get back there pretty easily.
[146:07.61]This one's easy.
[146:09.45]We can get up there quickly.
[146:11.75]Very quickly.
[146:14.89]Bang.
[146:15.37]And then we fly off into the car.
[146:20.29]Yoink.
[146:22.22]See you later.
[146:23.04]And then straight into the car.
[146:25.62]Hello.
[146:26.42]Skip this scene, please.
[146:28.58]They're trying to kill me.
[146:31.51]That was a 3D movie maker sound effect, by the way.
[146:35.16]Did you guys hear that?
[146:39.90]The whole thing is 40 fucking minutes long.
[146:42.28]I don't even remember the whole Wild West sequence.
[146:50.35]Come on, let me skip it.
[146:57.13]We're going to try the wagon and then left.
[146:59.28]That's what I want to try.
[147:08.36]There we go.
[147:12.25]Save as much battery as we can to make a bunch of mistakes later on.
[147:18.67]Skip.
[147:26.40]You know what I really need to do?
[147:28.92]I gotta write these down.
[147:33.28]All of them.
[147:34.46]I gotta write every single sequence down.
[147:38.43]Because I will forget once we get like fucking 25 minutes into this.
[147:40.53]I'm gonna have to get a pen.
[147:41.35]I'm gonna have to pen and write it down.
[147:57.23]It's my Sega CD, you're gonna like overheat.
[148:02.33]Did that happen?
[148:03.11]Was that a thing back in the day?
[148:15.93]Twitch plays Wireman.
[148:20.48]Down, and then we're in the Wild West.
[148:23.82]Full battery.
[148:28.65]The frame rate on this is so bad, dude.
[148:30.83]That makes me laugh.
[148:32.55]It's like fucking 16 frames per second.
[148:35.41]Wait, did it kill me?
[148:38.42]Oh, no, no, no.
[148:41.88]Okay.
[148:43.24]Can't skip it.
[148:44.78]Okay.
[148:55.19]Is it weird that I wanna make one of these games?
[148:58.64]It can't be that hard.
[149:00.36]You just have to film a bunch of dumb shit.
[149:03.44]You just gotta get a bunch of actors and play out like 90 different scenarios.
[149:07.74]And have people pick them.
[149:12.50]Okay.
[149:14.58]So we'll take a right, then we take a left.
[149:24.19]Do it.
[149:26.31]Howdy.
[149:26.85]Get ourselves arrested.
[149:28.71]Talk to the people on the left.
[149:31.83]They've talked about the hat.
[149:33.39]Punch the guy.
[149:33.99]Punch the guy.
[149:34.55]Howdy.
[149:35.34]Nice hat.
[149:35.94]Thank you.
[149:37.08]Where'd you get it?
[149:37.80]Oh, a store.
[149:39.12]General store.
[149:40.24]Looks awfully familiar to me.
[149:42.26]Can't skip it.
[149:43.44]Sure does.
[149:45.06]Oh, yeah?
[149:45.48]Sure does.
[149:46.00]We're going to throw a variable into the kick kit.
[149:47.82]M-O-O-S-E.
[149:48.62]Moose.
[149:53.44]That's my hat.
[149:54.70]Here we go.
[149:55.56]You know what we do with hat wrestlers?
[149:57.64]No.
[149:59.36]Kick.
[150:01.26]Okay, you can't kick.
[150:05.47]You can't kick.
[150:07.19]I went for like a fucking karate round out.
[150:10.45]And it didn't do anything.
[150:11.61]It still worked apparently.
[150:15.55]No, it actually did not.
[150:17.65]It did not.
[150:18.50]Yes, it did.
[150:19.28]But I lost...
[150:24.13]Uh... I lost battery for that.
[150:32.13]Skip this.
[150:35.11]We go right.
[150:38.43]Straight.
[150:39.25]And then we do wagon left.
[150:40.29]I just sit here with a coffee in my hand, like, oh, this is getting tense.
[151:00.25]Wasn't I supposed to do something here?
[151:05.89]What?
[151:06.49]Wait.
[151:06.75]Wait, that wasn't the right way.
[151:09.05]Hey!
[151:27.86]I'm taking I'm taking like the high road here That was a man of law enforcement I guess we better take her to Sheriff these guys are imposters look at their ID call the FBI check it out Am I gonna get protected here Luckily we were in the neighborhood.
[151:45.57]Oh really oh
[151:52.90]This is going on for a little too long.
[151:55.95]Here we go.
[151:56.77]Okay, the guy on the right just... The guy on the right just stood there.
[152:08.53]He just watched that all happen.
[152:12.59]We're playing out this long cutscene for no reason.
[152:15.55]That was just a very long cutscene.
[152:18.83]So this time...
[152:21.05]This time we're not gonna be like, excuse me, this is illegal!
[152:23.81]We're wasting battery, that's precious battery.
[152:25.13]So straight, right, straight.
[152:25.91]Straight, right, straight, left, left.
[152:27.62]Got it.
[152:28.08]Okay.
[152:52.18]Get in there.
[152:52.58]This game's too scary, turn it off.
[153:01.86]There they are, we have to turn back around, go right, straight.
[153:05.64]That way.
[153:06.18]Then we get out of here and we go straight.
[153:19.43]Brings us to the outdoors.
[153:21.20]Wagon.
[153:22.78]Left.
[153:30.28]Here we go.
[153:32.06]Is it just me, or has the video quality gotten worse?
[153:40.23]I feel like the video quality has degraded since we started playing.
[153:44.59]Or am I just losing my mind?
[153:53.31]Oh, they've lost their damn mind.
[153:54.81]Okay, I'm gonna take a left.
[153:59.43]Here we go.
[154:07.12]That worked.
[154:07.90]Now what?
[154:08.48]Holy shit, right.
[154:12.48]Oh, boy.
[154:13.06]Okay, so that was right.
[154:16.25]Now what?
[154:18.29]Left?
[154:23.46]We did it.
[154:26.31]Oh my fucking god.
[154:31.31]Ugh.
[154:34.41]Oh, there's so... Oh my god, there's so many options there.
[154:46.20]Okay, so that was... God damn it.
[154:50.83]I don't really...
[154:53.95]Wirehead blames German.
[154:55.39]We're gonna try it again.
[155:00.93]Come on, come on, come on.
[155:03.01]Left.
[155:04.29]Right.
[155:06.51]And then, I don't know, right, I guess?
[155:08.97]Left, right, right?
[155:11.56]That seems like the only possible way.
[155:20.03]Because I went left the other time.
[155:21.91]I'm gonna say left, right, right.
[155:31.88]It's left, that's how you get to this point.
[155:33.76]Then it's right.
[155:35.59]That's what I did.
[155:36.15]Left, right.
[155:37.53]And then left.
[155:38.45]No, I'm gonna go right.
[155:42.91]I'm gonna go right.
[155:44.83]Right.
[155:49.50]That wasn't it.
[155:49.94]That wasn't it.
[155:51.40]What the fuck?
[155:52.56]So it's straight.
[155:55.82]Why would it be straight?
[155:58.27]I'm driving right behind the cruiser.
[155:59.85]Why would it be straight?
[156:04.09]Left.
[156:07.73]That's not what I just did.
[156:08.77]The left was grayed out.
[156:11.32]The only other way was right and straight.
[156:15.85]I didn't do right last time.
[156:17.07]The grayed out one is the one that I did.
[156:19.90]Go look!
[156:29.46]There we go.
[156:30.20]Left, right, straight.
[156:31.16]Left.
[156:31.48]Right.
[156:46.28]Straight.
[156:48.76]Here we go.
[156:49.28]Straight.
[156:51.82]The only other option.
[156:54.62]Keep going.
[156:57.89]Oh, God.
[156:58.97]I just did straight again.
[157:01.09]And it worked.
[157:02.33]Right?
[157:03.39]It worked.
[157:05.01]Now what do I do?
[157:10.37]Oh, God.
[157:10.97]Okay.
[157:15.78]Jesus Christ.
[157:18.18]Who's this guy?
[157:20.54]New character.
[157:21.38]If you're not looking, we're riding in the back of a hayride.
[157:36.20]So we went from the Wild West.
[157:40.66]Oh, this is the guy.
[157:45.63]Isn't this the doctor that was on the screen at the very beginning?
[157:52.58]So, has my friend been taking care of you?
[157:55.48]What is going on, doctor?
[157:57.30]Why are these people chasing me?
[157:59.52]They're after you because of the operation.
[158:02.01]What do you mean?
[158:02.61]Well, after the accident, I reconnected your brain with electrodes.
[158:07.43]And now you're quite normal.
[158:09.21]Well, I don't know if I'd say that.
[158:11.21]Okay.
[158:11.45]Great.
[158:12.50]It's normal, except why are these people trying to kill me?
[158:15.70]Oh, they don't care about you.
[158:17.30]They want what's in your brain.
[158:19.40]Brain control.
[158:20.28]It's the dream of every fascist dictator in the world.
[158:22.54]Oh, God, that fucking CIA.
[158:23.56]One of the worst after us.
[158:25.26]Dr. Akable Slitcon and his thugs.
[158:28.59]Those two feds.
[158:29.89]Fucking goddamn CIA.
[158:32.03]They call her heels because of the stiletto shoes she wears.
[158:34.97]The last thing anyone ever sees.
[158:36.47]Yeah, I saw them.
[158:38.24]Well, that's great.
[158:39.42]What are we going to do?
[158:40.24]Well, the first thing we can do... Guys, the only way we can clear this thing is to get the story to my editor.
[158:45.97]The second this thing hits the front page, you two are safe.
[158:48.39]I agree.
[158:49.09]And you get your story.
[158:50.27]I agree.
[158:50.55]That's a good idea.
[158:50.93]You have a better idea.
[158:51.83]Let's bring it right to the press.
[158:59.41]Oh.
[159:00.17]Who is it?
[159:01.31]Housecleaning.
[159:02.11]It's housekeeping.
[159:03.75]Liar.
[159:03.87]Remote control active.
[159:05.75]What?
[159:06.09]It's just a fucking machine gun and now the... Okay, well...
[159:35.20]Look at how many fucking pixels are on the screen.
[159:39.94]Did she just cut the apple in half with her fucking heel?
[159:45.14]Oh my god.
[159:50.01]Oh wow, what a badass.
[159:51.13]Hey, remember when having like big blonde hair and sunglasses meant you were like a henchman?
[159:56.43]I think we lose.
[159:57.19]Yes.
[160:06.71]So, that obviously was incorrect.
[160:09.21]We have to go left.
[160:14.48]Yeah, he bit the apple and broke all of his teeth.
[160:20.76]Remember when, like, eating fruit was cool?
[160:23.04]Back in the fuckin' 90s?
[160:24.00]Let's try left.
[160:32.13]Straight.
[160:33.89]Left, straight.
[160:37.68]Okay, we're gonna go left, straight.
[160:40.90]That seems to have worked.
[160:41.74]There's gonna be one more thing here.
[160:53.18]Why take the wig off now?
[160:56.72]This is a wedding ceremony now.
[161:00.36]There's not enough pixels on the screen.
[161:01.80]Are we stealing the fucking wedding getaway mobile?
[161:05.16]Why are we taking the wedding Batmobile?
[161:08.87]Oh, that's incredibly rude.
[161:10.48]It's just like GTA.
[161:13.28]Oh my god.
[161:14.24]No!
[161:15.30]Left, straight.
[161:39.32]I don't like when you have to get into a fucking vehicle.
[161:41.86]When you get into a vehicle, it's just a wild guessing game.
[161:56.94]The vehicle parts of the game are the worst.
[161:58.44]Because you can't even think logically.
[162:01.39]You just have to pick one of three.
[162:03.33]You have a 33% chance to get it right.
[162:07.46]How much money did they spend on this dumb game?
[162:10.00]Not enough.
[162:16.78]Hooray!
[162:24.83]So this time, we're not going to go straight.
[162:27.71]We're going to go left.
[162:30.72]I think.
[162:35.56]Let's take a look.
[162:36.74]Left.
[162:40.58]And then right.
[162:43.04]And then right again.
[162:43.56]I don't know.
[162:44.00]What?
[162:45.24]What the fuck was that?
[162:46.04]It gave me... What?
[162:48.02]What was that choice?
[162:49.52]I pressed right and it was like, oh, you mean... Is that my brain?
[163:02.39]Hey, Slipknot.
[163:03.01]Look, I delivered the merchandise.
[163:04.33]Now payday, huh?
[163:05.95]All right.
[163:07.17]Bring him in.
[163:13.85]SAT uplink reconnected.
[163:15.23]6200 on your SATs.
[163:20.55]I guess that was like intended, maybe?
[163:27.59]Come on, let's get this thing over with.
[163:32.46]All in good time, my dear.
[163:35.60]He's a mad doctor.
[163:38.86]I mean, is that the maid?
[163:43.16]That's the maid, right?
[163:44.79]He's gonna get syringed.
[163:53.55]Guaranteed.
[163:57.01]Take your pick.
[163:59.28]Which one of these characters is getting a syringe in the neck?
[164:02.92]Strength boosted by 180%.
[164:04.14]Combat program activated.
[164:06.46]Punch him!
[164:11.40]Please.
[164:12.20]Someone help me.
[164:13.58]No one can help you.
[164:14.58]I pressed kick accidentally.
[164:16.28]Here comes the syringe!
[164:17.24]I told you!
[164:18.08]I fucking told you I was gonna get syringed!
[164:22.83]I fucking knew it!
[164:24.55]I knew it!
[164:27.33]We'll see.
[164:30.85]I couldn't punch him.
[164:36.50]Why would you try to kick in that situation?
[164:38.74]What is my plan here?
[164:39.74]I'm gonna punch this guy?
[164:45.02]Oh, I punched that guy's face off.
[164:52.97]I don't fucking know.
[164:56.63]Dude, that guy's skin came off of his face when I punched him.
[165:09.36]Left?
[165:09.72]There's no way to know.
[165:14.80]Punch him.
[165:18.52]They're all holding syringes.
[165:20.52]No, it's a guy with nunchucks.
[165:25.08]Why does that matter?
[165:27.35]Why are head's body found without head?
[165:33.93]They got cut my head off?
[165:48.29]You guys don't think I'm doing it again.
[165:51.11]I'm going to fucking do it again.
[165:58.33]Hold on a minute.
[165:59.87]Let me take a piss.
[166:01.04]I'll be right back.
[166:02.74]I want to do it again.
[166:03.46]We have to at least try it one or two times.
[166:07.88]I'll be right back.
[166:08.80]Grab a snack.
[166:09.50]I'll be right back.
[168:14.07]okay let's give this a try so do we do we have do we have a uh we have all this like written down like ready to go wirehead 4k remaster all right so should I just like get it I get like a hot die because I don't want to mess it up I want to get like back to where we were
[168:44.20]It's left.
[168:44.70]And then it's right.
[168:54.43]Up, up, down, down.
[169:00.55]Let's just get there.
[169:04.67]Skateboard.
[169:06.11]Whoa, holy shit.
[169:07.35]Okay, my button just almost didn't work.
[169:15.08]Turn left.
[169:16.78]Bang a right.
[169:17.53]Get in the car.
[169:20.55]Fly in there.
[169:24.59]And then... I literally just typed the Konami code.
[169:32.45]I don't know.
[169:37.40]I guess that'll count.
[169:44.37]We'll give this one last try here.
[169:51.07]And then I'm probably gonna call it to that.
[169:52.63]I need to get some food.
[170:01.28]We'll go for like another 20 or 30 minutes or so.
[170:03.44]I want to go for at least like three and a half hours.
[170:07.92]Just pull up one of the walkthroughs.
[170:12.27]Cheat.
[170:14.59]I have to complete the game.
[170:17.90]Alright, well, how about this?
[170:18.90]I promise you this.
[170:19.58]We will complete this game tonight.
[170:22.46]Okay?
[170:29.82]We will get to the end, even if we have to pull up like a fucking walkthrough.
[170:39.03]Okay, skip it.
[170:43.81]This game's way too good to not have closure on, right?
[170:52.29]Alright, I have... I have a walkthrough here pulled up to get us back to where we were.
[171:13.15]So there ain't gonna be any mistakes up until we get to that point, then no walkthrough.
[171:17.90]Or maybe I will.
[171:19.02]I don't know.
[171:19.84]Let's see.
[171:20.78]Made it back in time for the whoa.
[171:34.22]Yes you did.
[171:35.64]Mhm.
[171:36.22]Take a right.
[171:36.78]Watch out for the fucking bear.
[171:47.10]This is down.
[171:50.12]Mm-hmm.
[171:57.46]Didn't this guy have a wife and kids?
[171:58.86]Yeah, there was like a house full of people, from my understanding.
[172:01.48]Yeah, the bear, like, checks your wallet.
[172:07.50]He, like, grabs your shit.
[172:11.94]Mm-hmm.
[172:16.73]All right.
[172:25.45]Maybe making him do flips.
[172:26.43]Yeah, the little kids with the... That brings us here.
[172:40.22]Oh, fuck.
[172:43.14]It's okay.
[172:43.62]I'm over at the pig.
[172:44.64]I have to ride the pig.
[172:52.92]What the fuck?
[172:55.87]It's like, that was terrible.
[173:00.10]Looks like we got him, deputy.
[173:02.18]Why would I even get on the pig?
[173:05.20]He just looked at me so angrily.
[173:09.94]We skipped the whole bar fight.
[173:12.35]I ride a pig.
[173:18.47]That's so stupid.
[173:19.75]Alright, let's go.
[173:20.39]Get ready.
[173:24.89]Open the cell.
[173:30.68]Alright, let's follow the walkthrough and see what it tells me to do.
[173:35.36]The walkthrough tells me to go right here.
[173:36.84]Should I listen to the walkthrough?
[173:39.34]Or should I do what we did before and go straight?
[173:48.07]Walkthrough.
[173:52.94]Oh, the walkthrough is the same as the regular one.
[173:57.54]The walkthrough is what we already do.
[174:01.35]Okay.
[174:03.57]No cheating.
[174:04.07]Only cheating to get to the point that we got to before.
[174:07.47]So I don't make any dumb mistakes.
[174:09.73]And accidentally get us killed.
[174:15.01]I remember this part.
[174:20.86]Get to the fucking tank.
[174:28.96]Testosterone surge detected.
[174:30.50]Get in the tank.
[174:37.34]Alright, let's do it.
[174:42.58]There we go.
[174:47.96]This is left.
[174:53.15]If I remember, it's left, right, straight, straight.
[175:01.21]The testosterone surge.
[175:07.08]Left.
[175:08.54]Right.
[175:10.72]Straight.
[175:11.52]Straight.
[175:14.96]Yep, I remember this.
[175:23.05]Straight.
[175:24.97]Okey-dokey.
[175:26.23]And we should be back at the maid, right?
[175:36.07]Oh, goddammit, they got away again.
[175:37.71]Okay, here's this guy that we ride on the back.
[175:44.19]Okay.
[175:49.84]Can we skip it?
[175:51.06]No.
[175:54.08]Just jump off when you get to the nunchuck bridge.
[175:59.71]Is this the worst FMV game ever?
[176:02.97]No.
[176:04.73]Alright, so it's left, right?
[176:08.49]Left, straight.
[176:13.03]This is like the best FMV game ever, I would say.
[176:16.52]Alright, so now we are where we were before, pretty much.
[176:21.96]Almost.
[176:25.92]Left, straight.
[176:32.94]And then what?
[176:33.66]I think left again, right?
[176:39.72]Everything moves so fast.
[176:40.72]Well, we've been, if you're just joining us, this is like the seventh or eighth time we've gone through this part of the game.
[176:47.18]Or at least got to like... We've tried this game like 10 to 12 different times.
[176:54.49]Okay, this is the... I don't know what happens here.
[176:56.97]I think you just fail.
[176:58.99]I think you just fail here.
[177:01.25]And then you get syringed.
[177:07.67]I remember it was left, right, left.
[177:10.13]That's all I know.
[177:14.03]Left.
[177:17.07]Right.
[177:20.01]And then left.
[177:23.63]Now what?
[177:25.36]Wait, that wasn't what happened before.
[177:32.00]Straight.
[177:34.36]Of course not.
[177:36.47]Nope, we drove into this fucking car that's parked.
[177:39.56]It's me, the guy that we're just in every... Okay, that shit didn't happen before.
[177:48.52]Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[177:57.31]So, okay, we have not been here.
[177:59.47]We've been here before.
[178:00.33]Here comes the scene, here comes the punch.
[178:04.62]Punch him in the face.
[178:09.08]Wait, hold on a minute.
[178:09.74]Didn't he just unload the gun on us?
[178:15.20]They just both shot us with, like, a full clip of fucking ammo.
[178:20.50]We don't have any bullet wounds or anything.
[178:21.74]How are we alive?
[178:24.60]Fuck out of my face!
[178:29.66]Okay, left.
[178:32.00]No, no, which way?
[178:32.44]Let's go right.
[178:37.12]And then the guy with the nunchucks, we're gonna go left.
[178:45.83]They were stormtroopers.
[178:47.75]Okay, here we go.
[178:51.71]Jump off.
[178:52.09]What are you doing?
[178:55.95]What the fuck are you doing?
[178:56.99]I told them to go the other way.
[178:58.47]Oh my god.
[178:59.49]Look at me.
[178:59.83]Look at my nunchucks.
[179:08.92]Bad connections for Wirehead.
[179:10.78]Okay.
[179:13.90]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[179:18.09]Punch.
[179:18.71]Right.
[179:19.67]I did go right.
[179:24.72]You can see that actor smiling.
[179:28.48]So I hit right there and that didn't do anything.
[179:42.27]So I hit right and then I think it's straight.
[179:48.57]Because I hit right, and watch, it's gonna be grayed out, you'll see.
[179:50.65]Twitch still thinks I'm on.
[179:56.93]See, ready, watch this.
[179:57.87]I hit right this time.
[179:59.33]We need to go straight.
[180:04.17]I did right last time.
[180:05.45]What the fuck?!
[180:09.09]So it's left on the walkway.
[180:13.32]I thought it was gonna be straight, like straight over the railing, not like turn left and then straight.
[180:21.09]We'll see.
[180:24.65]Get the fuck out of here.
[180:30.18]Put him on the table.
[180:31.28]The nunchuck guy is great.
[180:32.80]Yeah, he is.
[180:33.46]How many times are we going to punch this guy?
[180:40.94]I don't know.
[180:42.50]So it's left on the walkway.
[180:48.49]Maybe you can't go on the elevator.
[180:49.57]I'm assuming there has to be a way out of every situation, right?
[181:01.64]Here we go.
[181:02.06]Left.
[181:10.47]You can't avoid the nunchuck guy.
[181:13.57]We've tried left, we've tried right, we've tried straight.
[181:16.13]You just can't go in the elevator.
[181:18.43]Okay.
[181:19.31]Good to know.
[181:22.97]We'll see.
[181:28.69]I actually did press right.
[181:30.33]Right doesn't do it either.
[181:31.59]I did right last time.
[181:33.87]Last time we got in that situation, it was right.
[181:36.83]So we're just not going to go in the elevator.
[181:43.23]Is the stairs straight or is the stairs left?
[181:45.45]How do we get out of here?
[181:50.33]Up the stairs.
[181:50.95]There we go, up the stairs.
[181:54.46]Okay.
[181:55.16]No, not up the stairs.
[181:57.80]All you fucking assholes that told me to go up the goddamn stairs, we walked right into the fucking crazy lady.
[182:07.20]This is really awkward.
[182:11.70]This is really awkward.
[182:14.82]You couldn't just fucking walk around her?
[182:25.51]You get back in your room, mister.
[182:31.51]We'll see.
[182:32.51]Let's try straight.
[182:40.87]Just go right.
[182:42.13]Guys, I did that last time.
[182:46.09]I fucking did that last time.
[182:49.19]I already did that shit.
[182:57.20]This way.
[183:02.96]What the fuck?
[183:03.90]Didn't I punch this guy?
[183:07.68]Honest to God, I went right last time.
[183:09.52]Every option doesn't work.
[183:11.72]No options work.
[183:18.32]We'll see.
[183:22.75]Alright, last time I did this, I went right.
[183:26.35]I went right after the elevator, and nothing happened.
[183:29.41]It didn't work.
[183:32.29]Get out of here.
[183:36.40]I swear to God.
[183:37.10]Alright, we're gonna go, we're gonna get in the elevator and then we're gonna go right.
[183:43.83]Get in the fucking elevator.
[183:52.77]Up the stairs, no.
[183:53.79]Here we go, right.
[183:59.98]Right.
[184:02.39]That didn't work.
[184:02.95]That didn't happen last time.
[184:04.89]Go back in the VOD and you tell me what button I tried to press in the last playthrough.
[184:14.12]It was right.
[184:16.04]It must have just fucking mashed up.
[184:18.52]And we're dead again.
[184:19.10]Alright, hold on.
[184:27.29]Pause the game.
[184:31.39]Alright, give me a break.
[184:32.33]The fucking Sega Genesis controller is on like a giant axis.
[184:36.61]If you press right, sometimes it just presses up.
[184:46.00]Which way am I going here?
[184:58.42]Bad controller.
[184:59.32]Bad controller.
[185:07.33]Alright, I'm seeing a lot of lefts here.
[185:08.81]Okay.
[185:15.30]Now what?
[185:16.64]Now which way?
[185:18.64]This is Twitch Plays.
[185:21.28]Twitch Plays Wirehead.
[185:28.49]It must not have registered when I pressed it.
[185:58.12]Okay, all right you guys ready you guys ready for the walkthrough it's tough We're doing a we're doing the full walkthrough of the game there it is There's the walkthrough We're doing it Here comes the full walkthrough of the game
[186:26.02]Here you go.
[186:27.44]Twitch plays.
[186:28.28]It's not Twitch plays.
[186:29.30]It's here comes the fucking walkthrough.
[186:39.12]Look, we've tried this like fucking 12 times.
[186:41.40]Come on.
[186:42.82]Oh shit.
[186:43.32]Okay, I gotta pay attention.
[186:49.04]Skateboard.
[186:49.64]I don't need to walk through right now.
[186:57.68]I'm gonna get lost with all the directions.
[186:59.36]I really might.
[187:05.08]Look, how about this?
[187:05.78]I won't use the walkthrough when we get to situations that aren't, like, left, right, left, left, straight, left, right.
[187:12.15]When we get, like, actual choices.
[187:14.09]Once we get actual choices, I just deleted the whole walkthrough.
[187:19.11]Fuck!
[187:20.37]Where am I?
[187:21.49]Right here.
[187:24.43]I don't know.
[187:26.66]Okay, we're good.
[187:36.29]I'm using the walkthrough right now.
[187:43.89]Walkthrough outsmart streamer because he hits the backspace key.
[187:52.98]This game is fucking fantastic, by the way.
[187:56.75]I do wish... I do wish that I could have, like, a save point.
[188:06.51]If I was allowed a save point... Where I could just come back to, like... A major checkpoint or something.
[188:13.16]It would be much more interesting.
[188:15.60]Otherwise I wouldn't have to memorize the entire video game's sequences of buttons.
[188:22.78]What are you doing?
[188:28.55]Use save states?
[188:30.30]Uh... Hey, my man.
[188:33.58]I'm on a Sega CD in real life.
[188:37.14]This ain't an emulator.
[188:38.32]This is the real deal sitting on my fucking floor over here.
[188:42.37]There's a real CD in here.
[188:43.63]This is authentic.
[188:58.26]No save states in the authentic... I had to be quiet for that.
[189:08.12]That's gonna be burned in everybody's brain.
[189:09.49]You guys are gonna have fucking dreams of that noise.
[189:11.91]I know I will.
[189:17.47]We gotta see what happens at the end.
[189:18.63]It's important.
[189:22.91]Real game fake victory.
[189:25.61]And you guys had fucking wanted me to do save states?
[189:27.69]That's not a real victory either.
[189:30.81]Using save states is like the same thing.
[189:34.86]It's still cheating.
[189:39.28]If I were to save scum right now, that's cheating.
[189:49.70]Make that a subse- Oh, that would get old real quick.
[189:57.43]Hey, you're good might be a good subsound.
[189:59.97]With the left.
[190:01.71]That could be good.
[190:02.19]It's okay, it's not like I haven't had the same subsounds and resubsounds for like fucking a year and a half.
[190:09.64]Dude, my resubsound is a Hearthstone card.
[190:15.12]And I've never even streamed Hearthstone.
[190:18.94]I've never played that game on stream.
[190:20.82]Maybe one time for 12 minutes.
[190:28.46]It's a fucking Hearthstone card.
[190:31.94]Alright, get on pig.
[190:39.44]I have played Hearthstone one time.
[190:40.80]At least once.
[190:50.77]Bring back Orson Welles.
[190:51.77]Orson Welles is like too long though.
[191:00.04]Alright, here we go.
[191:01.34]Let's get up there.
[191:02.22]Let's at least escape the power plant.
[191:03.76]Oh, for a second I thought I fucked up.
[191:05.68]Why do I lose battery for that if you have to do it?
[191:07.36]That seems like bullshit.
[191:11.34]Here we go.
[191:17.37]Bring back Paul Barrett.
[191:18.31]You guys, those of you there that used to watch the stream from like a couple of years ago, or like a year and a half ago or so now.
[191:23.21]No, actually that was like not even that.
[191:24.75]It was like just about a year.
[191:27.02]My original subscriber sound was like 17 seconds long.
[191:32.73]It was Paul Bearer doing a speech in the ring.
[191:35.85]It was abysmal.
[191:36.89]It like ruined streams.
[191:41.71]It was like somebody would subscribe and like a 30 second sound clip would play.
[191:46.42]It was like, it was too much.
[191:55.36]It was the best.
[191:56.10]It was.
[191:56.52]I loved every second of it.
[192:03.47]I wish I could bring it back, but I just... A long time ago, I tried to find another Paul Bearer sound clip.
[192:11.63]And there was a few, but it was just hard to put them together and piece them together and splice the audio and make it work and have it not sound terrible.
[192:18.41]Because a lot of the old Paul Bearer sound files are old and shit and they sound terrible coming through, like a microphone echoing and people cheering.
[192:26.10]Alright, here we go.
[192:35.74]Left.
[192:36.66]Left it is.
[192:47.56]Listen to me, son.
[192:49.16]I'm your dad.
[192:52.23]Well, not even that one.
[192:53.39]It was before that.
[192:54.11]Remember, it was... How do I play?
[193:07.76]What is it?
[193:09.24]Up?
[193:09.40]Okay.
[193:09.70]I decided I had a fucking minor freakout right there.
[193:17.80]I could have done that whole thing.
[193:22.84]I just forgot how to play the game though.
[193:31.74]Oh my goodness!
[193:33.18]Did you hear that?
[193:36.84]I would have just screamed it, but... Sorry guys, the whole impression didn't get there.
[193:44.52]That was actually good.
[193:48.84]How long have you been trying to beat this game?
[193:51.60]At this point, it's been like an hour and a half.
[193:55.32]I've been enjoying every second of it, though.
[193:57.02]This game is great.
[193:58.34]Okay, let's keep going.
[193:59.18]Let's see the machine gun maid.
[194:11.49]Guys, there are still games to play.
[194:14.80]I have, like, at least seven or eight more Sega CD games to play.
[194:18.62]Fuck, left?
[194:19.23]Okay.
[194:24.87]This is not it.
[194:25.61]Sega CD won't make a return.
[194:27.59]We may even do it tomorrow.
[194:40.26]There is more.
[194:41.86]This one was just the most important one.
[194:43.44]For sure.
[194:43.70]This is the one I wanted to spend the most time on.
[194:45.58]Because this one looked like the most fun.
[194:47.68]And it turned out it kind of was the most fun.
[194:50.32]The other ones had their moments.
[194:52.58]What was it?
[194:53.36]Super Scope?
[194:53.90]What was the name of that fucking dumb game?
[194:56.10]Tactical Strike?
[194:56.78]It was awful.
[195:01.81]But that was hysterical.
[195:08.32]Alright, we're gonna go left.
[195:09.14]I remember it's left, right, left, right.
[195:18.09]Dude, how would you ever get this the first try?
[195:23.15]And then left, left.
[195:26.43]Left.
[195:29.73]We're going very fast.
[195:30.97]Left.
[195:36.56]Look at this massive guessing game.
[195:39.03]How would you ever do this without a walkthrough?
[195:44.25]Are you fucking shitting me?
[195:48.51]There's no way you could ever get this.
[195:51.39]It's so much guessing.
[196:01.50]Okay, explosion.
[196:04.84]Car, look at those cars.
[196:05.93]They don't even have any damage done to them.
[196:11.49]Vehicle halted.
[196:13.73]Blood pressure normalized.
[196:14.83]Alright, let's try it from here.
[196:15.93]Oh, fuck.
[196:34.80]Hold on, what?
[196:37.11]Oh, I forgot about this joke.
[196:39.91]Shit.
[196:41.29]I forgot to play this joke.
[196:42.55]Instead of enriching a child's mind, these games teach a child to enjoy inflicting...
[196:49.60]I was going to play this like while I was playing Night Trap.
[196:51.70]I blew it.
[196:51.92]I blew it.
[196:52.34]That's too bad.
[196:53.52]This is like they held like a fucking Congress meeting about how Night Trap was the worst video game ever made.
[196:58.25]Damn it.
[196:58.41]That's too bad.
[197:14.18]They go over how, like, the Night Trap is gonna, like, ruin the world and stuff like that.
[197:17.80]That's fucking... What an idiot.
[197:19.18]God damn it.
[197:21.88]I blew it.
[197:22.34]It's okay.
[197:24.40]Whatever.
[197:27.30]I blew that one.
[197:40.99]Oh, shit.
[197:41.53]I'm trying to, like, get rid of it.
[197:45.99]I can't even, hold on.
[197:46.87]I like fucking, it won't like stop playing in the background.
[197:49.43]Oh no, there it goes.
[197:52.55]Well, whatever, it's gone.
[197:53.27]Hey, remember how funny that was?
[197:56.27]That was a pretty good joke.
[197:57.75]Look, Han's got your family.
[198:00.27]What?
[198:01.52]He's taken your family hostage and he wants Dr. Ohan exchanged for them.
[198:06.68]I'm so sad that I didn't get to play that.
[198:07.98]You guys would have thought that was really funny.
[198:10.52]Ow.
[198:10.76]I'll give them what they want.
[198:12.80]They don't need you.
[198:14.96]Are you crazy?
[198:16.48]Do you really think that Slitcon is just going to say, oh, thank you very much and let you walk away?
[198:23.08]No, he's going to kill you and you and anybody that knows anything about this operation.
[198:27.54]And your entire family.
[198:29.48]I should have never gotten you involved.
[198:31.16]Every stream, I know it's going to happen every stream.
[198:33.64]Come on, don't do that.
[198:34.74]You saved his life.
[198:35.80]This maniac has got my family.
[198:40.84]This guy's acting is perfect.
[198:41.90]Alright.
[198:42.66]Now we're on to the apex of the game.
[198:44.44]This is the last half of the game.
[198:46.07]We have to sneak onto the boat and we have to shoot the bad guy or something.
[198:49.61]In our just married mobile.
[199:11.16]Skip the laboratory.
[199:12.62]We, like, got our asses kicked in the laboratory, like, three times.
[199:25.49]Jesus, man.
[199:26.17]Like, this is... You know when Slender Man gets really close to you?
[199:30.01]And your screen gets all fucked up?
[199:32.53]Oh, hold on.
[199:33.01]Offline.
[199:34.81]Updating sat link location.
[199:39.06]Back online.
[199:47.77]Downstairs.
[199:50.25]No?
[199:50.59]Okay, that... That wasn't correct.
[199:59.31]I guess that wasn't correct.
[200:03.21]It was.
[200:04.35]What?
[200:11.32]The walkthrough is not correct.
[200:14.53]The walkthrough is not correct.
[200:18.84]Oh, no.
[200:23.54]The walkthrough isn't right.
[200:28.30]Shit.
[200:34.52]I'm on my own now.
[200:40.34]That little rat's starting to get to me.
[200:42.34]When I get my hands on that little freak, I'm personally gonna rip his eyes out.
[200:45.85]I'm gonna take that, boy!
[200:49.05]Hey, you watch me!
[200:50.31]What?
[200:52.41]That's what I get for cheating.
[200:53.23]You know, you're right.
[200:55.54]Let's see if the walkthrough is still incorrect.
[201:12.03]Yeah, no shit.
[201:15.09]It's a lot of rights so far.
[201:18.31]I might just be getting lucky.
[201:28.06]I think it's correct again.
[201:35.88]What?
[201:38.24]Hello?
[201:38.70]What?
[201:39.04]No.
[201:41.43]This isn't a choice.
[201:42.17]This is not a right.
[201:42.99]This is not a choice I'm getting.
[201:46.74]Whoa!
[201:46.96]That was too quick!
[201:50.34]I blew it.
[201:51.08]No, I didn't.
[201:51.68]Fuck.
[201:52.04]I went off script.
[201:55.06]Shit!
[202:05.49]God damn it.
[202:06.33]Now I don't know where I am because I deleted the rest of it.
[202:10.21]Oh, god damn it.
[202:14.08]My family died, by the way.
[202:15.36]Oh, god damn it.
[202:18.55]I don't know.
[202:18.93]Please be careful.
[202:25.95]Fuck.
[202:29.80]Shit in my pants, dude.
[202:35.20]I think I got it here.
[202:36.20]Just follow the walkthrough.
[202:40.75]They're in there.
[202:41.41]Yep, this will be good.
[202:42.51]I got it.
[202:44.92]Oh, what?
[202:45.61]What?
[202:52.97]Nice work.
[202:54.43]Holy shit, that was perfect.
[202:55.43]Good.
[202:58.16]And then this is right?
[203:00.28]Oh my god, I failed, but it's okay.
[203:03.76]That little rat's starting to get to me.
[203:05.76]When I get my hands on that little freak, I'm personally gonna rip his... That was the worst henchman in the whole place.
[203:09.95]Thank god they had the fucking rookie come after me.
[203:12.27]Hey, you watch me!
[203:14.52]Thank God the fucking rookie came here.
[203:22.75]Right.
[203:25.73]Right, right, right.
[203:27.61]It's three rights in a row.
[203:29.85]Hey, three wrongs don't make a right.
[203:31.23]You know what I'm saying?
[203:34.27]Hey, you know what I'm saying?
[203:35.29]Three lefts don't make a right.
[203:36.32]You know what I'm saying?
[203:36.84]Three wrongs don't make a left.
[203:38.78]You're good.
[203:50.92]Okay, now this is where it fucked up and it messed me up.
[204:02.24]I'm gonna toss this guy overboard.
[204:04.98]No, I'm not.
[204:07.82]Come on.
[204:08.66]I think the CD is scratched up at the end of the game.
[204:13.64]We just have to get this guy just like peeping on us now.
[204:16.93]It's left whenever I get control again.
[204:20.15]Got it.
[204:23.50]Holy shit.
[204:27.50]We have to finish this game.
[204:33.54]The CD is... To be fair, I have been playing the Sega CD for like fucking four hours.
[204:39.97]I don't think it was ever designed to do this.
[204:43.87]You were supposed to play this game for 20 minutes and give up and never play it again.
[204:53.99]Let's write one more time.
[204:55.07]We're getting close.
[205:01.67]I heard something!
[205:18.77]The amount of trial and error here.
[205:22.14]It's left again.
[205:26.14]There are so many guards everywhere.
[205:27.54]I can't wait to see how the end is.
[205:33.58]This is gonna be so funny.
[205:39.37]There's the lady that's always in a different costume.
[205:49.68]I forgot it!
[205:50.08]Okay, I got it.
[205:52.56]Just walking around corridors.
[205:53.80]There's no action.
[205:54.80]I'm so glad I'm using the walkthrough for this.
[205:59.84]Oh, that's my family.
[206:08.94]I want to go in there.
[206:10.90]I'm going to ruin the whole playthrough.
[206:12.28]And I deleted the fucking walkthrough.
[206:13.46]I have to go in there.
[206:18.10]I got to go in there.
[206:22.25]We have to go in there.
[206:23.55]Fuck.
[206:23.91]Feed you to the fish is not that intimidating.
[206:25.45]Okay, she's going to...
[206:38.31]Oh, no, there's an intruder, but she took her clothes off, so I like this now.
[206:42.64]Hey, you over there, how dare you break in?
[206:44.86]Look at this.
[206:46.16]Hey, look at her.
[206:46.92]Yeah, she's an intruder.
[206:59.69]Dude, I got hit in the fucking head with like a brick.
[207:05.45]Oh my god.
[207:05.71]What did he hit him with?
[207:08.07]What, did I hit him with a shoe?
[207:35.71]Holy fuck, that was not scary.
[207:41.68]What the fuck is going on?
[207:42.94]Are we really that scared?
[207:47.86]She just like jump scared us and it took us like five seconds to get jump scared.
[207:51.88]She did like a boo.
[208:05.42]Dude, hold on, hold on.
[208:07.47]The fucking hardest enemies in the game, a little child, stepped on his foot and the other guy fell off.
[208:16.13]We're stuck to OHA and the police.
[208:17.82]We can't wait for them right now.
[208:19.24]We gotta get out of here.
[208:20.22]Slick-Hunters, yes.
[208:22.46]My brain is fried.
[208:23.34]I can't even fucking do anything about that.
[208:24.90]Don't you understand?
[208:25.92]He's after you, not your family.
[208:28.41]Those guys were so hard to get rid of and they were everywhere.
[208:30.81]A fucking child stepped on his foot and he did like a Tom and Jerry ow my toe.
[208:35.43]Smashed his face into the wall and the other guy just fell off the fucking cliff.
[208:45.86]That was perfect.
[208:51.94]How is this game still going?
[208:58.43]Blood pressure normalized.
[208:59.63]Assessing the... Oh, God.
[209:04.81]I didn't listen to the... I didn't listen.
[209:10.26]We gotta see these options, man.
[209:11.50]Come on.
[209:12.46]Once... Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
[209:15.06]Once it becomes very... This girl's back.
[209:20.78]Punch her in the face.
[209:22.06]Punch her right in the face.
[209:23.31]Oh, fuck.
[209:25.91]That's annoying.
[209:28.05]Alright, we have it here.
[209:30.83]We've got our spot.
[209:32.30]Our checkpoint.
[209:35.18]Once it gets to the last fucking life, we'll finish the game.
[209:38.26]But let's try to fucking go through this and do some options here.
[209:45.45]Man, I love how somebody asking us if we're going fishing.
[209:47.61]Like, so straight and right both don't work.
[209:51.37]She did the same thing happens.
[209:52.29]Going fishing?
[209:55.03]Okay, so you can't go straight, you can't go right.
[209:56.71]It's the exact same thing I did.
[209:58.75]I pressed right and I pressed straight.
[210:00.72]It's the same thing.
[210:04.14]Do we have to go left?
[210:06.88]So what?
[210:07.68]I didn't press straight last time.
[210:09.36]How does that make any sense?
[210:10.52]I did.
[210:10.82]It's the controller.
[210:14.21]It's something to do with the fucking controller.
[210:18.53]Oh god, now we're gonna do bumper cars with this fucking guy.
[210:24.13]What the hell were you trying to do there?
[210:27.59]Was there any point of that?
[210:36.15]Marina crash, no survivors.
[210:39.79]But that's not what happened.
[210:42.79]A guy tackled me into the water and apparently every single fucking person died.
[210:52.11]What?
[210:55.46]Wait a minute.
[210:57.00]I don't have this part of the walkthrough saved.
[211:04.59]I'm going to just mimic everything.
[211:10.64]What?
[211:12.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[211:13.76]Hold on.
[211:14.12]Hold on a second.
[211:14.62]Hold on a second.
[211:15.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[211:16.20]Wait a second.
[211:16.76]Wait a second.
[211:18.70]Wait a second.
[211:27.45]Uh... It's straight.
[211:34.34]Oh, God.
[211:36.06]Please be careful.
[211:37.14]Why are we back here?
[211:40.44]Why the fuck are we... Why are we back here?
[211:44.92]The last checkpoint was right there.
[211:46.30]I hear something.
[211:50.34]Oh, no.
[211:50.90]Hold on.
[211:51.14]Wait, wait, wait.
[211:51.78]I can get it back.
[211:52.26]I can get it back.
[211:53.98]I gotta get to the first right, right, right, and I'll get it.
[212:01.94]Shit.
[212:02.16]It's okay.
[212:02.98]It's okay.
[212:03.38]She punches this guy in the nuts.
[212:04.20]It's okay.
[212:04.82]Here we go.
[212:08.88]No fucking around this time.
[212:10.34]This is where it is.
[212:11.08]Right, right, right.
[212:12.22]I'll get it.
[212:14.94]The first right, right, right.
[212:21.44]There's up, up.
[212:24.29]There's left, left, right, right, right, right, right.
[212:26.89]Okay.
[212:27.33]Left, left, left, right.
[212:32.64]Hold on, I'll get it.
[212:33.38]Here it is.
[212:34.46]We're good.
[212:35.56]Everybody calm down.
[212:37.82]Everything's under control.
[212:41.70]Right, right, right.
[212:42.72]There it is.
[212:44.34]We got it.
[212:45.40]Saved.
[212:46.78]Everybody chill out.
[212:53.39]That little rat's starting to get to me.
[212:55.39]When I get my hands on that little freak, I'm personally gonna rip his eyes out.
[212:58.91]I'm gonna take that, boy!
[213:01.65]Well, using the walkthrough as just cheating, if I have lives to use, why not try to see some of the options?
[213:09.60]You want me to just skip the whole entire fucking game?
[213:13.60]Even if I have lives to lose to try?
[213:15.84]Like, come on, that's no fun.
[213:19.88]Be careful.
[213:23.48]They're all over the place.
[213:25.43]That was too close.
[213:27.11]Alright, this way.
[213:30.45]We got it, don't worry.
[213:33.55]Follow me.
[213:37.75]We go left, and then it's another right, right, right.
[213:39.83]Wait a minute.
[213:40.31]No, no, wait.
[213:41.19]Wasn't one of these wrong?
[213:43.67]Oh, fuck.
[213:44.09]I think one of these cutscenes was wrong, wasn't it?
[213:47.67]I don't remember which part of it.
[213:54.02]One of these, the actual walkthrough is incorrect.
[213:58.74]I don't remember which part it is.
[214:09.16]I think we're good.
[214:17.54]Right again.
[214:20.18]Right again.
[214:20.68]And then two lefts.
[214:32.31]Let's hope that... Please, controller, don't fuck up.
[214:35.87]Don't, like, hit up accidentally.
[214:42.04]left left it really is just a guessing game holy okay there's that lady left then we go right and then we're good right
[215:13.59]Left.
[215:22.28]And it's left again.
[215:23.00]No, we're good.
[215:24.92]This is the end.
[215:25.52]We get to see this again.
[215:28.84]We get to see... Okay, what items does he actually hit him in the face with?
[215:31.10]Here we go.
[215:35.28]Oh, well, I just skipped it.
[215:36.28]So never mind, apparently.
[215:39.82]I skipped it.
[215:41.67]Sorry.
[215:42.87]Left.
[215:43.33]We're just beating the game.
[215:50.46]Here we go.
[215:51.08]Right.
[215:54.04]Double left.
[216:04.01]Left.
[216:04.53]So that's right, left, left.
[216:05.77]So left again.
[216:13.21]Easy.
[216:14.49]What?
[216:15.16]Wait, what happened?
[216:16.68]What happened?
[216:16.98]Is she dead?
[216:21.50]I could go over that jump and be fine.
[216:24.78]I could go over that and be okay.
[216:26.60]That was just a shitty little kid's jump.
[216:29.16]I think we can get a taxi over here.
[216:32.00]We're obviously going to take this thing.
[216:33.86]Oh, Ned, come on.
[216:34.70]Not again.
[216:36.46]Come on.
[216:37.68]We've got three rights in a row here.
[216:39.38]I must be crazy.
[216:44.86]Of course the buggy is the correct option, why wouldn't it be?
[216:48.29]We've got three rights in a row.
[216:53.17]The end of the game is in our sights right now.
[217:02.64]That was the worst part of the whole game.
[217:10.56]Imagine getting this far and fucking up because you have to trial and error figure out where the fuck to go.
[217:16.74]And having to start the whole game over and not have to cheat code left, right, left.
[217:19.86]You know what I'm saying?
[217:29.09]Almost there.
[217:31.89]Explosion, right?
[217:32.75]No.
[217:33.27]Those cars don't explode.
[217:34.51]Only the ones before do.
[217:40.53]Left, right.
[217:40.91]Up.
[217:41.03]We're almost there.
[217:41.63]Left.
[217:42.17]Left.
[217:42.51]Right up.
[218:12.23]We win.
[218:14.31]Drove over the cop car.
[218:16.49]Now we get to... Here's the final boss fight.
[218:19.85]Apparently I have... Apparently the button combinations... I don't want to fucking spoil anything.
[218:24.72]But we win.
[218:25.24]We beat the game.
[218:28.12]Legit time to win.
[218:30.86]Okay, apparently we're going to the New York Times.
[218:41.81]The Times.
[218:45.41]That's all the button combinations.
[218:46.99]I win.
[218:48.93]Not so fast.
[218:52.25]I believe we have some unfinished business to attend to.
[218:54.91]Oh, no.
[218:55.70]Not you.
[218:56.24]The game is over, Slitcon.
[219:00.72]Give it up.
[219:01.34]Slitcon?
[219:03.72]That sounds like a shitty, like, 1950s convention.
[219:12.27]All right, so you got a gun?
[219:15.46]The game is never over, my dear.
[219:17.82]Would you like to come with me or shall we finish things right here?
[219:21.42]Put your hands up.
[219:22.10]Answer your question, Dr. Sleet Khan.
[219:24.58]I think we should end everything right now.
[219:27.42]All of your evil-minded schemes.
[219:33.48]I didn't do that.
[219:34.40]I didn't press that button.
[219:35.64]That was for me.
[219:37.20]Sally?
[219:40.84]Everybody come on.
[219:42.02]I've got two hours if I'm gonna make that deadline.
[219:44.52]You'll be just fine.
[219:45.46]Take him to the hospital.
[219:47.04]So that's it.
[219:50.48]Congratulations, you beat Wirehead.
[219:53.90]Yes, he did look at the camera.
[219:55.18]Of course he did.
[219:59.37]Miss Levin, you can't go in there.
[220:01.53]What are you trying to do to me?
[220:03.11]Sam, I am so sorry I didn't call you back sooner.
[220:05.41]Where have you been?
[220:07.53]You guys didn't think I was gonna beat the game on screen?
[220:08.85]The mayor has called me.
[220:09.95]The chief of police has called me.
[220:12.17]You have given me more trouble in one day than I've had in 40 years at this paper.
[220:17.78]Sam, you don't understand.
[220:20.00]This is Dr. Oha.
[220:22.08]And this is Ned Hubbard.
[220:23.28]Let me take my glasses off just to you.
[220:25.44]How do you do, sir?
[220:26.40]How do you do?
[220:27.32]It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir.
[220:28.96]That guy's dead.
[220:30.28]That guy's dead.
[220:37.59]Dude, she grabbed that guy and like turned.
[220:40.21]She turned that guy's body and he fucking died.
[220:42.39]Oh no, not the kids.
[220:51.68]Oh no, not the kids.
[220:52.68]Okay, don't fuck it up this time.
[221:01.93]I gotta see her fucking kill that guard.
[221:05.12]She Vulcan Death Crips that guard.
[221:06.74]She grabs him on the shoulder and there's a crunching noise.
[221:09.70]She didn't do shit.
[221:10.62]She didn't break his neck.
[221:11.46]She just pushed him.
[221:12.42]And his neck fucking snaps.
[221:14.54]This is the last try.
[221:15.10]I can't fuck it up.
[221:15.88]It's punch, kick, punch.
[221:16.58]Sam, you don't understand.
[221:17.20]This is Dr. Oha.
[221:28.11]And this is Ned Hubbard, the infamous Wirehead.
[221:31.45]How do you do?
[221:33.31]It's a pleasure to finally meet you, monsieur.
[221:38.47]I can hardly wait to hear your story.
[221:40.91]You're a cartwheel before you fight somebody.
[221:42.63]Get out of here.
[221:45.59]Oh, is that what you want to do?
[221:48.14]Not bad for a Wirehead.
[221:50.10]How about one of these kicks?
[221:52.21]Hi-yah!
[221:53.41]Ooh, I did a ton of roll.
[221:56.56]Punch her right in the mouth.
[221:57.44]Game over.
[221:58.00]I win.
[221:58.28]Into the bookcase and fucking does an Abraham Lincoln skull.
[222:05.71]And all it took was a fucking Colonel Sanders statue to land on her fucking head and kill her.
[222:10.75]She dead?
[222:11.41]Not yet.
[222:12.57]She has a very bad head injury.
[222:15.22]I think I can save her.
[222:16.42]Call an ambulance.
[222:17.96]But why, Doctor?
[222:18.98]She's been trying to kill us.
[222:20.60]There's good and evil in everyone.
[222:22.94]It's just a matter of what buttons you push.
[222:24.80]Oh, please.
[222:26.28]She just broke a guy's fucking neck.
[222:28.23]What about the guard that she just killed?
[222:29.73]Actually, a little better.
[222:31.03]I have some new technologies that will increase her performance and response time considerably.
[222:36.67]Why would you be giving this girl fucking extra superpowers?
[222:39.40]Just what we need, a female wirehead.
[222:41.81]She's being rewired as we speak, and we're hoping to get her a little bit more on the side.
[222:47.36]Why am I like Mark Zuckerberg at, like, fucking Facebook Con?
[222:52.18]I had a little help.
[222:53.30]Somebody who basically saved my life.
[222:56.32]Thanks again.
[222:57.18]It was great talking to you.
[222:58.57]My family's waiting for me.
[222:59.57]I'd like to try to relax and just get back to normal.
[223:02.69]Thank you.
[223:03.23]What a fucking fantastic video game.
[223:07.37]Who is it that you keep turning to and addressing?
[223:09.99]What are you talking about?
[223:11.52]You keep turning around and talking to this person and asking for help.
[223:16.04]That was OHA's, you know, plan.
[223:18.40]To help me.
[223:19.60]I mean, that's my override.
[223:20.96]So OHA, you're talking to OHA?
[223:23.11]No, it's not OHA.
[223:24.07]No, no.
[223:24.69]It's, uh, we'll call the person the player.
[223:27.77]I'd like to leave it at that.
[223:29.15]I just don't understand some of the choices you made.
[223:31.77]Why did you pick the way?
[223:35.28]Is this some kind of interview?
[223:36.56]This is like the tell-tale, like, here are your choices.
[223:39.84]I had to go down the mountain on that bouncy thing and risk my life.
[223:44.52]I'm sorry that I took the wagon, the Jeep, the skateboard, the Zodiac, and I rode the pig.
[223:53.36]Neither of you listened to me.
[223:55.89]I had some really good ideas.
[223:57.65]We listened.
[223:58.59]I said go right, you said go left.
[224:00.23]Just say all the things, all the choices you made.
[224:02.39]We listened to you once.
[224:03.25]What was that?
[224:03.91]When we went out of the boat.
[224:05.57]And where did it get us?
[224:06.97]I got a kick in the face from that.
[224:08.27]Yeah, they're just going over all the choices.
[224:11.97]Oh, that's so stupid, I love it.
[224:14.38]You know, back, back like 25 fucking years ago, that was, that was a huge deal.
[224:24.26]What a paving the way of revolutionary storytelling, in-game storytelling.
[224:30.28]Wirehead did it.
[224:32.48]This shit was like almost 30 years ago, guys.
[224:35.01]Can you imagine being a little kid and holding the controller?
[224:37.95]No, hold on a minute.
[224:38.71]No little kid is going to beat this game.
[224:40.56]They're going to do left, right, and fail and cry.
[224:43.84]All the adults that played this game, no adults beat this game either.
[224:46.76]I don't know why I'm saying that.
[224:48.48]So, all the people like me, like, you know, me.
[224:51.25]Like, I'm the only person to beat this game.
[224:53.61]So, like, that's pretty cool if I was like 30 years ago.
[225:05.27]I'm the only person that's beat this game.
[225:07.35]Find me somebody else that has.
[225:12.13]Just out of curiosity, I want to see this.
[225:17.78]The only person ever.
[225:19.90]No indicators.
[225:24.14]Oh, they just don't... The indicators aren't on the screen.
[225:27.88]Oh god, that's fucking horrible.
[225:30.04]Alright.
[225:34.12]The guy, what about the guy that made the walkthrough?
[225:37.60]So you don't understand this.
[225:38.76]I fucking wrote that walkthrough.
[225:40.08]I beat this game.
[225:41.88]That's my walkthrough.
[225:42.96]I just didn't want to say it on stream because I didn't want, obviously, like, that's like a, I don't want to like, oh, I'm using my own walkthrough.
[225:52.90]Up the difficulty?
[225:53.72]No, I'm not going to up the difficulty.
[225:56.92]This exact same studio made a Garfield game.
[226:02.63]That's why it was wrong?
[226:04.31]Sure.
[226:05.29]That's why it was wrong.
[226:07.27]Anyways, I've been going for four hours now.
[226:12.29]And I kind of want to take a break.
[226:14.25]I want to get some food and call it a night.
[226:17.63]So the thing is, there's still... There's still like one, two, three, four, five, six.
[226:26.35]There's about like six or seven.
[226:27.77]I think like seven Sega CD games that I still have.
[226:33.61]And I would probably say just to kind of get them all out of the way.
[226:38.86]There's a couple of good ones in here.
[226:42.56]So don't worry.
[226:44.28]There's at least like two or three good ones.
[226:46.88]So tomorrow, we are going to continue Sega CD tomorrow.
[226:51.17]Just because the setup is kind of ridiculous.
[226:56.83]There's a lot of like wires and shit.
[226:59.45]And I really don't want to take it all apart.
[227:01.84]and then put it all back together again like next week.
[227:06.08]So this box full of Sega CD games, we're going to continue tomorrow.
[227:10.89]And we got like two or three good ones.
[227:14.37]Actually, there's a couple that I still have ordered that are like on the way.
[227:17.79]So we'll see.
[227:20.85]Hopefully we have a good stream tomorrow with the remaining Sega CD games.
[227:25.67]The German Rumble live action is going to be...
[227:29.48]I want to give myself the week- not BRP, what the fuck am I doing?
[227:33.24]I want to give myself the weekend to make a bunch of characters.
[227:37.81]Because I don't want to rush it.
[227:38.91]I don't want to like half-ass it.
[227:40.15]I want to... I mean, I have to make a bunch of characters and I haven't been able to do that the last couple of days.
[227:45.91]So this weekend I'm gonna like just sit my ass down and make a bunch of the like new characters that you've seen on stream.
[227:52.29]Because I want it to be a lot of new characters and a lot of old characters, obviously.
[227:57.00]So, I will see you guys tomorrow with more Sega CD.
[228:01.78]Let's blow through the rest of this fucking catalog.
[228:05.42]There's not much left, but there's enough there to probably do another stream, so... Much love, guys.
[228:10.74]Take care.
[228:11.50]Before I go, though, I do want to say thank you.
[228:13.65]There was some pretty large bits that were given over the course of the last hour or so, but I was just so locked in, I couldn't even think.
[228:21.57]Thank you to Tommy Toaster, Squiddy10.
[228:25.76]Stix Renegade, Stix gave $5 again.
[228:29.86]Tell Mitt Romney that everything's going to be okay.
[228:32.00]Why would I need to tell Mitt Romney things are... Alright, Mitt Romney, it's going to be alright.
[228:37.15]Afrin, thanks for the bits.
[228:38.51]They say, hey Jeremy, hey Afrin.
[228:40.89]Tula Productions, thank you for the bits as well.
[228:43.39]They officially revoked my gamer license for cheating.
[228:45.98]It's okay.
[228:49.14]I haven't, dude, I haven't had my gamer license.
[228:51.12]I've been fucking streaming video games unlicensed for the last, like, at least six and a half months or so.
[228:58.54]Bingus Tingle, thanks for the bits.
[229:00.45]Tula Productions again.
[229:03.59]These bits are for Wirehead Germ Edition and for The Rats 3.
[229:06.27]I had to watch so many Sprint commercials for these bits.
[229:10.41]Hope they will find the development of these professional-grade films.
[229:16.60]Thank you, though.
[229:17.24]Thank you, Tula.
[229:18.78]Also, Dr. Fudge gave 20 bucks a while ago.
[229:22.00]Hopefully you're still here.
[229:22.86]He gave that, like, more than an hour ago.
[229:27.57]Where's the ending where you marry the bear and ride away on a motorcycle together?
[229:31.74]That would have been good.
[229:36.74]But, thank you, Doctor.
[229:39.34]Thank you, good Dr. Fudge.
[229:43.27]Also, what the heck...
[229:45.24]Dreadful Judge and Abysmal Melody, thanks for the bits as well.
[229:48.68]How much did this game cost?
[229:51.00]Uh... Somewhere between $10 and $20.
[229:52.82]I don't know, maybe $12?
[229:55.06]At like, uh, you know... I mean, all these games are on Amazon.
[229:59.27]Uh, Jen betters right at the very end here.
[230:01.01]I was an undercover agent this whole time.
[230:02.49]You're finished.
[230:04.07]Well, fucking... Cha-ching.
[230:06.01]You know what I mean?
[230:06.45]Like, cha-ching.
[230:07.27]Put the cuffs on.
[230:08.25]Cha-ching.
[230:11.21]Anyways, see you tomorrow.
[230:13.39]Thanks, everybody.
[230:13.89]Thanks for all the new subs, too.
[230:15.68]I promise that I am working on a solution for that.
[230:20.38]I've said that, like, fucking a thousand times.
[230:22.76]But I actually, like, figured out how to do it.
[230:25.36]So, see you guys tomorrow.
[230:27.87]Thank you so much.
[230:29.25]Good night, and goodbye.
[230:55.43]you
