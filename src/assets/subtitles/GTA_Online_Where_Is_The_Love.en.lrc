[00:07.01]Oh, look!
[00:09.79]It's another player!
[00:11.23]Maybe we can be best friends!
[00:13.87]Hi!
[00:14.47]Wee-ow!
[00:15.71]That was my face!
[00:17.45]I just hurt my face for you.
[00:18.77]That means we're best friends, right?
[00:20.61]I-ah!
[00:24.37]Trying this again.
[00:26.11]Look it.
[00:26.83]Who would swan- If I was a threat to you, I would not swanton bomb off the top rope.
[00:30.91]Oh my fucking god, dude!
[00:32.52]Seriously!
[00:37.99]Be my friend.
[00:39.50]Can you please be my friend?
[00:44.08]I don't appreciate people that I'm trying to be their friend.
[00:47.60]Need a friend?
[00:48.36]And they just do this to me every single time.
[00:51.02]Need a clip?
[00:51.68]I swear to God.
[00:53.08]This guy.
[00:53.68]Need a friend?
[00:54.40]Yeah.
[00:55.14]Yes.
[00:56.14]You don't need a friend.
[00:57.18]You know why?
[00:57.66]Because you're a dick.
[00:59.01]And you know what we do to dicks?
[01:00.69]We might get shot by this guy.
[01:02.89]We... No.
[01:03.95]Got him.
[01:04.71]Got him.
[01:05.45]He's dead.
[01:05.87]Yeah, he's dead now.
[01:06.89]He's dead now.
[01:07.89]Need a friend?
[01:08.61]No, you don't.
[01:14.84]No, no, you're gonna, of course.
[01:17.32]Of course, why would you do anything else?
[01:21.72]I almost forgot.
[01:22.66]I gotta put on my safety helmet.
[01:26.58]Yeah, that didn't do much.
[01:33.39]I think the reason this guy has not attacked me on sight is because he's AFK.
[01:38.87]I fucking knew it.
[01:39.92]I told you.
[01:40.62]What'd I tell you?
[01:41.48]What'd I tell you?
[01:43.54]You know, in all my years on the force, Tim, I've never seen so many RDM dipshits in all my life.
[01:48.82]Yeah, fuck them.
[01:50.02]Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[01:51.10]I'm the bad cop.
[01:52.32]All right, that's the last of that.
[01:53.74]Let's go and, uh, lunch is on me today, Tim.
[01:56.61]Yeah, all right, I'm gonna get some dick fingers.
[01:59.63]Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:01.39]Yeah, I need them right now.
[02:02.97]Yeah, make sure you drive us straight into the fucking wall, too.
[02:06.23]Yeah, damn right, I'm the bad cop.
[02:08.36]Excellent job, Tim.
[02:09.50]Great landing.
[02:10.50]Wait, by the way, what?
[02:11.84]Wait, where are we?
[02:12.70]I don't know.
[02:13.08]Where are we?
[02:13.60]Where are we?
[02:14.34]Where are we?
[02:15.04]Where are we?
[02:15.52]I don't know where we are.
[02:16.22]I gotta use my flashlight and see where we are.
[02:18.58]What happened?
[02:19.30]I forget everything.
[02:20.30]I have fucking amnesia.
[02:21.52]You have amnesia too?
[02:22.32]Oh, shit.
[02:25.73]No, no, no, no, no.
[02:26.57]Now is not the time.
[02:27.76]Now is not the time to be doing this.
[02:29.14]You don't need the extra, like, $36 you're gonna get out of that goddamn register.
[02:33.06]Get on the bike.
[02:33.96]Now.
[02:34.60]We gotta go.
[02:35.52]Three stars.
[02:36.60]Two cruisers outside.
[02:37.64]Great.
[02:38.10]Fantastic.
[02:38.78]I'm glad that you needed that, like, ten bucks you just took.
[02:41.98]And now we're both dead.
[02:43.12]Hi, everybody.
[02:46.41]My name is Mr. Sneakman.
[02:48.47]Hi, everybody.
[02:51.41]It's Sneakman part two of the sequel.
[02:54.85]Can we drive something else besides like your sardine creamed corn can crushed car?
[03:05.93]This thing's a piece of shit.
[03:08.30]Look at this clown car.
[03:10.92]Oh, we gotta chop him.
[03:11.92]Gotta chop him.
[03:13.20]I'll take care of this.
[03:15.08]Covering fire.
[03:19.20]Oh.
[03:20.62]Oh, damn.
[03:22.70]I didn't seriously shoot the pilot in the face, did I?
[03:26.36]This guy's driving around like a fucking maniac.
[03:28.68]How did I just do that?
[03:30.86]I'll never do that again.
[03:31.80]Put me in that same situation a thousand times.
[03:34.24]Holy shit, you're gonna kill us.
[03:37.81]This is the part of town, Rodney, that I was talking about.
[03:40.71]With the invisible poles you can hit your fucking head on.
[03:43.55]Pay attention to me.
[03:44.45]I know where they all are.
[03:45.59]I've mapped them all out on my GPF device.
[03:48.23]Except for that one.
[03:50.15]Oh!
