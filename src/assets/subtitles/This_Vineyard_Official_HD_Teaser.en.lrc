[00:06.09]You are standing in paradise right now, Frank.
[00:10.51]Simply take a look around.
[00:12.06]Do you see anything besides pure beauty?
[00:15.72]Would you ever sell it?
[00:17.22]Oh, no.
[00:18.08]Absolutely not.
[00:19.80]Everything you see here is all for my boy.
[00:28.50]It blows my mind.
[00:29.34]How does it taste this good?
[00:31.74]Well, you don't learn something unless you teach it, in my opinion.
[00:34.91]I've been working at the same place, Los Santos University Wine Studies, for the past 25 years.
[00:40.51]And counting, let's hope.
[00:44.72]Mom saw those guys outside again.
[00:46.32]It's the third time this week.
[00:48.38]I'll handle it.
[00:49.08]Just stay inside.
[00:50.58]This is my vineyard.
[00:52.74]This is my recipe.
[00:54.86]You're not going to take it.
[00:57.43]You hear me?
[00:59.88]You don't understand.
[01:01.52]It's not just good.
[01:05.16]It's the best.
[01:09.82]We want that wine.
[01:11.62]It's not for sale.
[01:14.97]What?
[01:16.21]No, Jeffrey, get down!
[01:18.01]Damn it!
[01:19.07]No!
[01:20.61]Oh, you bastard!
[01:21.95]You son of a bitch!
[01:23.49]Who did this?
[01:25.29]No!
[01:25.43]No!
[01:36.29]Did he receive our message?
[01:41.84]I'm going to need a favor.
[01:43.10]You're trying to do this all by yourself?
[01:44.70]That's crazy talk.
[01:45.96]What do you need?
[01:46.80]I think you know what I'm going to do, Tom.
[01:50.40]They tried to kill my son.
[01:52.88]They torched the very thing that I've put my entire life into.
[01:58.24]You want this vineyard?
[02:00.52]Come and get it.
[02:01.74]But I warn you, I have a very special set of skills like the guy from Taken.
[02:08.66]I want him dead, and I want his family dead too!
[02:12.86]You have no idea who you're dealing with.
[02:16.24]You wanna bring a fight to me?
[02:18.78]Now that was a big mistake.
[02:20.58]I beg to differ.
[02:23.12]They're not gonna stop until they get what they want!
[02:26.66]If I have to go through every single one of them, so be it.
[02:32.29]Wine is complicated.
[02:34.87]Life is complicated.
[02:37.73]Do you have the right ingredients?
[02:39.03]Do you have the right time frame?
[02:40.55]Are you ready to start your winery?
[02:43.68]Are you ready to start your life?
[02:46.98]Write that down.
[02:48.80]Because yes, it will be on the test.
