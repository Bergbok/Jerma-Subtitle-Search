[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.53]You know what I mean?
[00:20.03]Yo, GatoGameCatcherHD is fucking great.
[00:28.04]We're already mad.
[00:29.74]I haven't even begun to play this mad game.
[00:31.92]This game that makes people mad.
[00:33.62]And I'm already mad, so it's okay.
[00:35.40]We're already off to a great start.
[00:37.01]I'm already angry.
[00:48.99]I love how that's like a finished stream.
[00:50.63]Hey, I streamed earlier.
[00:53.95]Did you see that?
[00:59.19]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[01:06.20]Five months with the picture.
[01:08.08]I did a couple of different sub things today, guys.
[01:11.48]Kim is a nerd.
[01:13.48]Welcome back.
[01:14.32]Five months.
[01:16.08]I have a new sub sound.
[01:18.90]I don't know if I'm going to keep it, but who knows?
[01:25.70]Okay, let's play the Salton Sanctuary.
[01:29.18]I think this is where I left off last time.
[01:30.49]I'm pretty sure it is.
[01:33.35]But, yeah.
[01:34.65]You know.
[01:38.66]We're just gonna go.
[01:40.36]I actually remapped my controls so they're more Dark Souls-y.
[01:48.02]Hopefully that helps.
[01:49.58]The one problem with doing that is all the on-screen prompts are wrong.
[01:57.13]So that's going to screw me up a lot.
[01:59.51]Oh, preemptive salt.
[02:00.45]Preemptive salt.
[02:06.61]Okay, where the hell was I going?
[02:07.65]I'm pretty sure I was going this way.
[02:13.95]Yeah, I think.
[02:16.98]Yeah, I remember this.
[02:17.68]How did my dock deployment go?
[02:27.15]It went well.
[02:28.99]Oh, that's not Circle.
[02:30.21]Okay, I was wondering.
[02:34.54]It went okay.
[02:36.64]I can't say it was, you know, it really solved any problems, but, you know.
[02:44.02]Don't mind me just eating salt.
[02:46.54]Not yet.
[02:48.50]Not yet.
[02:52.56]I can't, like, block his arrow.
[02:54.80]That's a bunch of bullshit.
[02:59.24]Duh, don't hit the- that's gonna get me killed.
[03:02.01]That's gonna get me killed, I already know.
[03:04.13]I already know.
[03:06.07]Get your laughs ready.
[03:08.01]Get your giggles ready, because anytime a prompt comes up that says circle, my circle has been rebound to square.
[03:15.70]So, I'm going to roll off a cliff.
[03:17.02]It's going to happen.
[03:19.27]Be ready to laugh.
[03:20.03]Be ready to get your laughs out.
[03:27.45]Holy shit, I'm almost dead.
[03:28.89]I'm going to get poisoned to death here.
[03:34.72]I'm going to move a couple things around.
[03:36.08]Hey, there we go.
[03:37.96]Now I can see things.
[03:39.77]I want to make sure I can see if anyone subscribes because it's odd because I have everything on one monitor over here because I'm using the other one for PS4.
[03:46.59]Oh, yes.
[03:53.46]I see the evil in your eyes.
[03:55.82]But you know my Undertaker will destroy him at SummerSlam.
[04:04.25]Oh, my goodness.
[04:05.71]Did you hear that?
[04:13.37]That's so long.
[04:14.89]That is so long.
[04:15.81]That's like 20 seconds long.
[04:18.68]Oh, I didn't even subscribe.
[04:20.92]I was too busy not dying.
[04:22.78]It was minxie minxie one, two, three.
[04:27.27]Welcome.
[04:28.13]Thanks for subbing.
[04:29.31]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[04:36.84]Caldaca, thanks for the five months.
[04:38.48]Alright, this is going to be like a war between Orson Welles and Paul Berry yelling at each other.
[04:44.32]I don't think I'm going to keep it.
[04:46.11]It's kind of too much.
[04:55.02]I can't even play.
[04:56.52]It's too hard to play the game.
[04:57.66]Wait, is he going to walk over here?
[05:01.26]Will he just fall down?
[05:04.52]Is he stupid enough to dive over here?
[05:12.49]Ooh, got him.
[05:16.71]I think I am going.
[05:17.27]Okay, I know I'm going the right way now, so let me do a little bit of exploring.
[05:26.91]Undertaker!
[05:28.27]Treasure up, fall.
[05:30.87]Ah.
[05:32.30]You can't undo it, it's permanent now.
[05:34.88]Ooh!
[05:37.78]Take Oath.
[05:40.08]No, I keep... I change Covenant every hour.
[05:45.06]Oh, a stranger comes to this mossy belly of a tree.
[05:49.07]No worries, I'll set you straight.
[05:50.71]Have you ever met a woods wraith?
[05:53.61]No.
[05:53.77]No.
[05:56.09]Well, well, well.
[05:57.26]I'm a stone root, or some would call me.
[06:00.33]Woodsway, wait.
[06:02.17]That's hundreds of years.
[06:03.87]We've stayed in the forest.
[06:05.79]Our allegiance has always been to the spirits of the woods.
[06:09.04]Men have invented, praised, and died for countless fleeting gods and demons, but our forest is firm.
[06:14.64]Dr. Gangly.
[06:14.96]Do you know my Undertaker will destroy him at SummerSlam?
[06:20.40]Oh my goodness.
[06:21.16]Did you hear that?
[06:30.67]I did hear that.
[06:32.63]Welcome to the family.
[06:33.95]Thanks for, uh... Thanks for subbing, Doctor.
[06:38.33]Raise your pallbearers.
[06:41.21]Uh, what the hell does this guy want me to do?
[06:43.69]That's gonna distra- Oh, this is the worst time for me to put that new sound on.
[06:47.99]Because I'm playing a game that requires a ton of confr- Like, con- I almost just said confrontation.
[06:52.44]Concentration.
[06:54.46]I'm gonna be in the middle of a fight, and someone's gonna pallbearer me.
[06:57.28]And, like, it's a 20 second long subsound.
[07:03.46]I was thinking.
[07:05.50]Poison, poison.
[07:06.36]Yeah, you're going to tell me about the poison.
[07:10.09]But woods wraiths protect the forest, so the forest protects us.
[07:12.41]Okay, they're forest people.
[07:14.23]Do I want to be a woods wraith?
[07:15.35]No.
[07:17.77]Not really.
[07:19.11]Sorry.
[07:20.29]But I will.
[07:21.35]Can I level up?
[07:22.72]No.
[07:23.52]Do I have any salt bags?
[07:28.06]Where are my salt bags?
[07:29.90]I know, I definitely have to have a couple.
[07:31.22]Yeah, I got enough.
[07:33.55]Let's crush some salt!
[07:38.29]Is that gonna be enough?
[07:45.52]No, it's not.
[07:48.00]Shit.
[07:48.28]Oh well.
[07:48.96]Whatever.
[07:49.24]Just keep going.
[07:51.60]Actually, no, I'm gonna go up.
[07:53.00]I feel like this is the next area.
[07:59.85]So, how's the audio?
[08:02.39]Fine.
[08:03.77]Because I just had to redo a bunch of things.
[08:08.80]Get out of here.
[08:10.72]Get out of here.
[08:14.94]Oh, come on.
[08:15.60]I can't even get up there.
[08:16.40]I can't even dive through him.
[08:18.58]Can I try to throw a potato at him?
[08:23.15]Okay, I got up.
[08:28.55]Red grass.
[08:29.43]I have a new healing thing now?
[08:35.53]Eat it to restore some HP.
[08:38.07]Wasn't there another one I had before that was... Oh, fuck.
[08:43.57]I want to stand in his burp.
[08:49.46]Ow!
[08:51.66]This'll kill him.
[08:53.16]Oh my god, it didn't kill him.
[08:54.00]This'll kill him.
[08:54.60]This'll kill him!
[08:55.68]This'll kill him!
[08:57.58]What the fuck am I doing?
[08:59.63]Alright, let's go up here.
[09:01.19]There's a place to go over here, so why not do it?
[09:06.82]Shit, I was hitting... I gotta get used to the actual controls that I've wanted.
[09:16.97]Shit.
[09:17.69]Hangman.
[09:22.20]Expect weak monster ahead.
[09:23.50]This is a boss.
[09:27.10]Every time I see that candle, it's a boss.
[09:29.76]Well, whatever.
[09:30.20]Let's just see.
[09:31.24]See what...
[09:31.99]Yeah.
[09:32.86]Is the boss right here?
[09:34.76]Already?
[09:35.80]Right after that second one?
[09:38.52]Whatever.
[09:40.54]What the hell are you doing?
[09:41.36]He's like singing.
[09:43.86]Can I just stay up here and see what he does?
[09:45.24]Alright, he shits up.
[09:49.91]He has like a potion magic.
[09:54.57]What else do you do?
[09:57.24]What else do you do, you sack of shit?
[09:58.94]I feel like this guy's not going to be extremely difficult if he keeps doing this.
[10:09.87]Or maybe not.
[10:10.27]He doesn't need to have very much health.
[10:13.15]Alright, the green potion is always one of these little guys.
[10:18.49]He puts down a purple potion.
[10:21.37]What does he do now?
[10:27.01]There's another green one.
[10:28.51]It's probably random.
[10:32.11]Yeah, there's the purple one.
[10:33.65]Get off me!
[10:39.20]Alright.
[10:40.38]So you gotta, if he throws a green one down, you gotta get rid of it, like, immediately.
[10:49.45]This guy really isn't that big of a deal.
[10:51.20]Probably kill him the next- I mean, if I don't kill him now, I might be able to kill him, like, later.
[10:54.34]At some point.
[10:56.12]Fuckin' hell.
[11:03.08]I'm just surprised- Am I just being poisoned right now?
[11:07.61]Okay, I'm gonna die.
[11:10.69]Alright, well, for having absolutely no idea what the hell was going on, I got him to 50% health.
[11:14.55]Okay.
[11:21.59]He's right there.
[11:22.77]Why the hell is he right there?
[11:25.11]Let me try that again.
[11:28.21]Alright, green potion is slime.
[11:32.91]Gotta get rid of that immediately.
[11:34.11]I don't care about you.
[11:43.56]I'm actually kind of glad he's right here.
[11:46.96]Oh, please.
[11:48.10]Get the hell out of here.
[11:51.39]He's very easy to get back to.
[11:52.62]Alright, let's do it.
[11:54.58]Let's try it again.
[11:57.16]I thought that was him talking.
[11:58.70]GhostFlyer1, thanks for subbing!
[12:00.24]Goddamn.
[12:04.23]Uh...
[12:21.81]Get rid of the slime.
[12:23.79]No, don't get hit by the slime and kill it.
[12:30.91]This guy's fucking nothing.
[12:34.03]Just hit him again.
[12:34.45]Don't even care.
[12:35.03]Just kill him.
[12:36.23]He's dead.
[12:37.15]Game over.
[12:37.72]That guy was easy.
[12:42.66]Dropping money down there too.
[12:43.76]I need to go get the rest of that money.
[12:49.20]I'm gonna die.
[12:52.36]What the fuck is that sub sound?
[12:54.60]I know, right?
[12:55.14]There's a secret treasure over here.
[13:00.86]What's the secret treasure?
[13:01.76]Ooh, it's a level up device.
[13:08.66]And... A mossy key.
[13:12.70]Okay, that guy was exceptionally easier than the first two bosses that I faced.
[13:20.30]I guess you just have to get him up there and just spam the hell out of him.
[13:22.48]Just keep him locked in the corner.
[13:24.82]Okay.
[13:26.06]Let's go level up.
[13:27.66]Oh, shit.
[13:27.98]Well, I didn't kill the guy that was down here, so make sure I don't forget that.
[13:30.52]Actually, I don't even need to fight him.
[13:37.91]It's three bosses down.
[13:39.37]Three bosses down, boys and girls.
[13:45.94]Level up.
[13:47.28]We're going strength.
[13:47.96]Oh, shit.
[13:48.42]Wrong button.
[13:57.37]Do I have permission to make you a character that does absolutely nothing in the game I'm working on?
[14:03.51]As long as I'm not doing anything, like, illegal.
[14:06.39]Whatever, I don't give a shit.
[14:07.87]Go for it!
[14:11.50]I got a lot of points.
[14:15.10]It's like, it's weird.
[14:15.86]People, like, ask me all the time, like, Oh, can I have permission to do this?
[14:18.60]Can I have permission to do this?
[14:20.24]And it's hard to say yes, because you never know what you're saying yes to.
[14:23.30]You know what I mean?
[14:23.72]Hey, can I use you in, like, my project?
[14:25.26]Like, this, like, thing you did?
[14:26.93]Yeah!
[14:28.13]And it turns out they, like, make it look like you're, like, a serial killer or something, or, like, doing something horrible that you, like, never would have signed off on otherwise.
[14:37.37]Oh, yeah, I took, like, a bunch of audio of you out of context, and it looks like you're eating this person.
[14:42.42]In real life.
[14:43.94]And I sent it to the proper authorities.
[14:46.78]It's like, uh, okay, thanks.
[14:51.18]I'm gonna just do another point of strength.
[14:56.04]Willpower...
[15:05.51]But I guess, like, the only blanket statement I can make is, as long as you're not going to do anything illegal with whatever I'm saying or doing, then, you know, it's fair use to make me, whatever, yeah, whatever.
[15:26.83]Something like that happened to my art.
[15:28.39]I don't want to go legal, but... Oh, that's too bad.
[15:30.95]That's why it's, like, hard to say something like that.
[15:32.95]Like, oh, yeah, use whatever you want.
[15:36.58]Uh... I'm not sure what the hell to do.
[15:40.32]I guess I could do two-handed, uh, class one.
[15:43.76]Yeah, I'll just do this just to get it.
[15:44.88]I still have points to spend.
[15:49.36]Another point in willpower?
[15:51.55]Yeah.
[15:54.35]Okay.
[15:55.05]Alright.
[16:02.67]It's a go.
[16:03.83]How much damage do I do now?
[16:09.77]Ooh.
[16:11.05]Shit.
[16:11.43]L2 and R2 is something different.
[16:14.21]Oh boy.
[16:14.75]This is going to be hard to navigate these menus.
[16:17.18]Because I can't.
[16:17.92]What is L2?
[16:18.18]Uh.
[16:23.13]Fuck.
[16:23.77]Oh no.
[16:25.93]How do I get my sword back?
[16:27.05]There it is.
[16:29.63]I just want to look at it.
[16:31.19]Oh my god.
[16:38.42]Info.
[16:39.42]What is circle?
[16:40.30]I mean, what is square?
[16:43.32]Square is... R1.
[16:46.56]Okay.
[16:51.73]I'd like to scream the best.
[16:58.55]Hey, uh, dead prisoner.
[17:00.03]Thanks for stopping.
[17:15.17]Welcome, welcome.
[17:15.86]You know, I could go just... I'm sure this is, like, the next place to go, but... Is there more to do over on the other side?
[17:22.82]Probably.
[17:23.30]Holy shit, that's so slow.
[17:30.05]Oh, there's aliens from Alien down here!
[17:31.61]This is terrifying.
[17:32.37]Oh, shit.
[17:35.83]I see the evil in your eyes!
[17:41.04]But you know
[17:44.27]I'm so dead.
[17:50.88]Ashen pants.
[17:52.46]Did you hear that, Ashen pants?
[17:56.04]I don't know if I'm going to be able to come down here yet.
[17:58.72]Thanks for subbing, Ashen.
[18:00.20]Appreciate it.
[18:00.82]You're welcome.
[18:04.35]Hello!
[18:14.33]Why are you doing that over and over again?
[18:16.51]What the f-?
[18:17.17]It's like Hunter pounced me!
[18:18.61]Who is this guy?
[18:21.97]What is this dude all the way down here?
[18:25.65]Eight rabbits!
[18:30.00]Oh god.
[18:38.81]Who the fuck is this?
[18:42.69]Who the fuck is this guy?
[18:44.03]Who are you and why are you here?
[18:49.20]Eight rabbits.
[18:50.98]Thanks so much, welcome.
[18:52.68]Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
[18:57.82]Oh my goodness!
[18:59.08]Did you hear that?
[19:01.74]Okay, I'm not gonna go that way yet.
[19:08.49]These aliens are freaking me out.
[19:10.57]Shit!
[19:12.36]That's so hard to determine when they're going to do that.
[19:13.94]They do a quick pounce.
[19:24.14]Can't make that jump.
[19:28.57]Yeah, I actually, I remember last stream we were talking about it.
[19:32.91]We were talking about subsounds and wanting to use like, oh yeah, Paul Bearer would be like really funny subsound.
[19:39.98]I was watching countless Paul Bearer interviews and YouTube videos and stuff until I found that one.
[19:45.80]Because a lot of them were hard to hear what he was saying.
[19:48.08]Warhammer, hold on.
[19:48.99]Warhammer.
[19:54.33]Two-handed.
[19:55.87]Two-handed.
[20:03.49]Wow.
[20:08.17]57?
[20:08.19]89?
[20:09.88]Are you shitting me?
[20:15.60]Wow, this thing is fucking crazy.
[20:19.84]It's not even that slow either.
[20:20.81]This thing is fast as shit.
[20:22.09]Look at how fast this is.
[20:26.39]Paul Berry?
[20:27.05]No, it's Paul Bearer.
[20:30.49]Paul Bearer.
[20:31.05]Uh, Percy Pringle.
[20:34.55]He is deceased.
[20:35.75]He is no longer with us.
[20:37.86]He is a wrestling icon.
[20:41.72]And, you know, he's a really funny guy.
[20:43.20]Really interesting dude.
[20:44.06]That guy got annihilated in one swing, so we're keeping this on.
[20:53.29]Paul the Bearer.
[20:54.53]Paul Bearer.
[20:58.05]Like, Paul Bearer.
[20:58.77]You know, casket...
[21:01.72]Funeral, funeral.
[21:02.42]He was supposed to be like a funeral home director or something.
[21:05.87]That's going to go this way still.
[21:07.75]More aliens.
[21:12.05]Why are they just looking at me?
[21:14.65]Come over here.
[21:15.07]Are you serious?
[21:17.52]Did I seriously just get air shot?
[21:19.70]I just got air shot by this asshole.
[21:21.80]Give me a break.
[21:22.36]I'm going to go down this way.
[21:25.26]I want to explore a little.
[21:31.99]Get out of here.
[21:34.87]These guys just crawl around walls and shit.
[21:41.17]This one's not even paying attention.
[21:44.99]I'm just trying to sneak up on him and make like a... I was trying to make a point and he didn't let me make the point.
[21:51.08]I think I'm about to block right into the guy that's down here.
[21:54.40]Isn't there a guy down here?
[22:00.46]Like this thing is outrageous.
[22:03.98]Seriously.
[22:08.44]Look at the reach.
[22:09.32]It's got insane reach.
[22:10.94]There's an eyeball monster following me around now, looking at me.
[22:13.30]Okay, they're being protected.
[22:19.62]They're being protected.
[22:20.90]Well.
[22:33.28]Oh well.
[22:34.58]I guess, uh, you have to die to the enemy to know what it does.
[22:39.08]If I knew that, I would have just killed him.
[22:46.81]Oh, shit.
[22:48.83]Okay, no, I actually want to go this way, because I feel like that boss down there is, like, the next person I need to kill.
[22:54.41]He's, like, right down here.
[22:55.45]Hey, look, here's a shortcut.
[22:57.13]Don't, please, God.
[22:58.77]I hit the button.
[23:00.39]You know what button I hit.
[23:05.41]Ooh.
[23:08.61]Another ring.
[23:15.16]Conduit of mind.
[23:15.90]Where is it?
[23:16.68]Mind, body, or the halves effect of focus usage on fatigue.
[23:22.92]What the hell does that mean?
[23:26.02]I have no idea.
[23:29.22]No clue.
[23:32.42]It means something.
[23:36.26]Who knows?
[23:38.15]Can I open this?
[23:39.31]Yeah, there's a boss right here.
[23:40.89]Alright, we'll hit another new boss.
[23:43.43]Let's fuck him up.
[23:47.25]The Kraken Cyclops.
[23:50.14]Okie dokie.
[23:56.20]Oh!
[23:56.32]Okay.
[23:58.30]Okay.
[23:59.60]Okay.
[24:00.50]Slow down.
[24:02.43]He's gonna jump.
[24:05.37]Look at the reach he has, too.
[24:06.49]Wow.
[24:09.45]Okay, you gotta jump over it.
[24:10.49]You have to jump that.
[24:11.17]If he's on the ground, you gotta jump.
[24:15.85]What else do you do?
[24:19.52]Jump.
[24:20.18]Come on.
[24:20.76]I wanna, like, just confirm my hypothesis.
[24:23.00]That's not the right move.
[24:23.82]That's also not the right move.
[24:28.18]Come on, do it.
[24:28.64]I wanna see if I can go underneath it.
[24:36.47]Yep, there it is.
[24:36.95]Fuck.
[24:38.55]Dead here.
[24:41.57]Yeah.
[24:42.87]Okay.
[24:51.44]At least I have the skip to right there.
[24:52.78]Yeah, I saw the evil in his eyes.
[24:59.26]It was very evil.
[25:04.58]Treasure up.
[25:05.02]I didn't even go up here.
[25:07.92]Let me do that.
[25:17.32]You found the sub sound.
[25:18.40]Get out of here.
[25:26.09]Can I jump from here?
[25:28.73]I can.
[25:30.57]Gray pearl in a box.
[25:34.95]Leather, huh?
[25:43.59]Strike defense.
[25:44.57]I'm assuming strike defense is probably... You know, I feel like the guy with the axe... Is that strike or slash?
[25:54.95]I really don't know.
[26:01.37]I'm going to assume it's strike because it wasn't like an ax or maybe it was slash.
[26:05.51]Who knows?
[26:07.35]Damn it.
[26:07.71]Who knows?
[26:19.24]Rogue's jacket.
[26:20.30]Actually, this one is strike.
[26:23.88]This one has more strike.
[26:27.54]I'm gonna assume that's what it is.
[26:28.90]I probably am wrong.
[26:30.22]I'm always wrong.
[26:31.44]I am always wrong every single time.
[26:35.88]But, you know... Fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
[26:39.65]Fuck it.
[26:40.85]I can go up here.
[26:46.93]Anything?
[26:47.31]Anything?
[26:47.63]Anything?
[26:50.07]Come on.
[26:50.61]You wouldn't put this here if there wasn't something over there.
[26:54.50]Whatever.
[27:01.06]No, the wine sub sound is there for resubs.
[27:07.98]I'm gonna try that guy again.
[27:09.06]I feel like if I get his pattern down, I'll be fine.
[27:13.52]Why can't I drop down?
[27:14.20]If I get that guy's pattern, he will die.
[27:27.87]And that'll be boss number four down.
[27:32.96]Alright, let's try this again.
[27:43.70]Okay, well, I didn't jump it.
[27:48.58]I can't jump it, huh?
[27:49.39]I wonder if I should just block it.
[27:52.87]Alright, this is... Okay.
[27:57.51]He has an outrageous hitbox.
[28:01.70]He hit me with, like, his fucking... the handle.
[28:07.77]I'm wondering if I should just be blocking or try to parry him?
[28:13.79]I don't know.
[28:16.93]Doesn't seem like you can dodge those.
[28:19.51]So, I'm gonna try and parry him.
[28:21.79]I know that sounds crazy, guys.
[28:23.87]But I'm gonna try, because I don't see any other way.
[28:26.39]There's no other way.
[28:36.04]We're going for a parry.
[28:37.90]Let me block his gigantic piece of cement he has for an arm.
[28:48.36]I'll get it.
[28:48.78]It's too annoying to time.
[28:53.01]Heal.
[28:58.87]Come on.
[29:03.33]Man, I don't know.
[29:04.39]Let me just try blocking.
[29:07.70]Okay, that's not a terrible idea.
[29:09.56]It uses a lot of stamina, but I'm not getting, like, hurt.
[29:14.18]I can just go around him.
[29:19.14]I definitely should... I'm definitely supposed to carry him.
[29:22.06]Why wouldn't I?
[29:27.15]Let's try it again.
[29:27.79]Really?
[29:30.47]I didn't get it that time?
[29:36.83]Man.
[29:38.89]You are just one giant hitbox, aren't you?
[29:44.39]Maybe not.
[29:51.56]Thankfully you're doing the same dumb thing over and over again.
[29:55.88]No, I parried that.
[29:57.02]If you're parryable.
[30:05.64]Yeah, I'm not sure how to avoid that.
[30:13.25]Especially when he does, like, the giant uppercut.
[30:16.81]You can't really jump over it, and you can't really dodge through it either.
[30:23.45]I don't know.
[30:23.95]I don't know.
[30:26.77]Maybe you are just supposed to dodge.
[30:35.25]Fuck!
[30:43.68]Vilio!
[30:44.96]Vilio!
[30:47.50]Vilio!
[30:49.97]Oh, he's gonna give me the power.
[30:51.83]Give me the power, Paul Bearer.
[30:53.01]Okay, I actually did dodge through it.
[31:04.68]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[31:06.46]Don't mind me, I'm just trying not to get killed.
[31:08.08]I guess you can dodge through it, but you gotta be, like, perfect with it.
[31:14.32]Yeah, okay, you can dodge it.
[31:15.36]I was just not doing it fast enough.
[31:16.72]Okay.
[31:17.60]Problem solved.
[31:25.01]Ooh, what?
[31:32.75]What?
[31:37.75]He's gonna seriously time these dodges.
[31:52.57]Just like that.
[31:53.13]That was close, I almost missed it.
[31:59.19]Whoa, he's doing something different!
[32:03.18]No, you fuck!
[32:05.10]You fuck!
[32:07.76]Oh, you shit eater!
[32:08.84]Okay, I'm fine.
[32:09.46]No, I'm not!
[32:15.00]Oh, you shit eater!
[32:15.90]Stop eating shit for a living!
[32:35.28]Ooh, he does it immediately.
[32:36.46]That's his phase two.
[32:37.46]Fuck.
[32:48.46]That's bullshit.
[32:49.66]I dodged through that shit.
[32:56.42]That's bullshit.
[32:56.90]I dodged through that shit.
[32:59.46]I'm so screwed here.
[33:08.00]I feel like some of those times when I dodged through it, I should have dodged through, but it just didn't.
[33:15.38]I feel like a couple of those times when I was dodging through it, I should have dodged through, but I got like popped in the air like a piece of fucking dirty popcorn.
[33:25.71]But that's what you gotta do.
[33:27.15]That's the strategy.
[33:38.02]It's kind of finicky.
[33:41.74]Tim!
[33:45.82]Why did it just drop?
[33:46.76]I'm right here.
[33:47.96]Oh, here we go!
[33:51.35]Did you hear that?
[33:58.49]Thanks a lot, Tim.
[33:59.33]Welcome.
[34:00.80]Thanks to the subscribe.
[34:02.10]Thanks to the subscribe!
[34:07.22]That's... What the fuck?
[34:08.40]Are you kidding me?
[34:09.12]There's no fucking way you hit me with that.
[34:12.02]Or that.
[34:12.86]Or... What?
[34:13.72]I don't understand.
[34:14.97]I'm having trouble understanding.
[34:16.87]Is anybody else having trouble understanding?
[34:18.53]I'm dead.
[34:38.58]What the flying fuck?
[34:42.15]What the fuck?
[34:43.07]It worked that time.
[34:49.37]Why do you work like 42% of the time?
[34:51.37]I don't get it.
[35:14.01]Drink it.
[35:24.57]That's... I was even by it.
[35:26.34]I was by the sword, and I still get hit by it.
[35:28.40]I didn't get hit by that one.
[35:34.72]I didn't get hit.
[35:35.38]I don't... I can't even... I can't believe it.
[35:39.03]I can't believe it.
[35:53.39]Alright, he does it immediately after that.
[35:54.77]Okay.
[35:56.25]I understand it now, but still... Still really hate the finicky dodge roll.
[36:03.80]A shitload.
[36:06.20]Quarry, number 80!
[36:07.00]Did you hear that?
[36:11.88]Oh my goodness!
[36:13.64]Did you hear that?
[36:22.07]I think my favorite part of that, uh, quarry.
[36:24.95]Thanks for subbing.
[36:26.85]Vince McMahon is gonna keep saying, did you hear that?
[36:37.62]I gotta go to bed.
[36:38.22]It's the egg festival tomorrow.
[36:39.66]That's true.
[36:40.20]It is the egg festival.
[36:41.45]I gotta get my sleep.
[36:50.67]Thank you very much welcome welcome.
[36:58.33]I don't need to drink that one.
[37:02.70]Oh
[37:20.81]Oh, don't get stuck in them!
[37:27.96]I still don't understand why the fuck that keeps happening.
[37:35.42]I can't even move.
[37:41.25]I gotta keep doing that stupid fucking move.
[38:03.77]So you can't dodge.
[38:04.61]Okay, there's one that you can't dodge.
[38:06.32]And it's that one.
[38:06.98]So what the fuck are you supposed to do about it?
[38:10.06]Block it?
[38:11.46]Yeah, that's what you have to do.
[38:12.84]That's what you have to do that.
[38:13.88]You have to do it.
[38:14.64]Don't you understand?
[38:15.18]Oh, easy there, buddy.
[38:18.71]That's the one you can't block.
[38:20.25]Or dodge.
[38:21.41]Okay, so one of them you cannot dodge no matter what.
[38:23.91]And it's the one he's on the ground with it.
[38:43.63]What a load of shit.
[38:47.77]Take my energy.
[38:52.38]The problem... Don't!
[38:53.38]Why are you doing that?
[38:55.94]It's doing that on purpose.
[38:57.00]It's just doing that to try to make me fall.
[38:59.46]It's gonna work.
[39:01.14]One of these times it's gonna make me fall.
[39:03.70]And I'm gonna blame it on that.
[39:04.86]And I'm gonna get very mad.
[39:05.70]I'm gonna blame it on that.
[39:06.56]It's not my fault.
[39:11.31]Yeah, I'm just gonna block it.
[39:13.37]No reason to take unnecessary damage for no reason.
[39:20.12]Wow.
[39:20.44]Okay, maybe I can't.
[39:22.10]Because I'd lose all my energy.
[39:46.73]How is that any different?
[39:47.85]Come on.
[39:57.70]I don't like you over there.
[40:10.84]Back over here.
[40:11.64]I was gonna die if I didn't do that.
[40:23.43]I was behind his sword.
[40:33.11]Sometimes you just have to not understand the mechanic.
[40:36.74]It works sometimes.
[40:38.04]It doesn't work other times.
[40:41.70]Jesus.
[40:50.19]He just... I just... I'm gonna have to fucking start jumping him.
[41:02.40]Fuck.
[41:05.78]I'm dead.
[41:10.58]It wouldn't be bothering me so much if it was working like half the time.
[41:17.97]And even sometimes being behind him and getting hit by it.
[41:22.06]That's what's real fucking annoying.
[41:25.16]As I dodge, I'm behind him and then my character pops in the air when I'm behind him.
[41:30.66]Now that's real fucking annoying.
[41:33.33]You know what I'm saying?
[41:45.33]Try spinning.
[41:49.29]I'm just gonna, like, do a spindy-doodle.
[41:57.85]See what I'm talking about?
[41:59.33]It just happened right there.
[42:02.63]Why didn't it not happen right there?
[42:03.57]I'm behind the fucking guy.
[42:07.33]Alright, I think I'm gonna level up a little bit before I do this again.
[42:13.19]Apparently I jumped over that one.
[42:42.25]I'm gonna go level up a little bit cuz I'm going I'm gonna fucking scream at this bus.
[42:49.77]Oh my lord Fuck that asshole
[43:02.72]Let me see.
[43:03.12]I want to just check something real quick.
[43:04.62]Let's see.
[43:05.82]Uh, where is it?
[43:33.97]Where's my warhammer?
[43:40.60]Maybe I should put on the other thing.
[43:42.14]Because maybe I am rolling so slow.
[43:44.62]Whatever it is.
[43:45.12]I can't tell.
[44:18.12]Yeah, maybe I am.
[44:21.56]Just for curiosity's sake, I'm going to see what happens if I use... I just want to dodge around.
[44:25.30]See what happens.
[44:28.84]I want to see.
[44:35.36]This is just for the purposes of finding out what the, uh... If it's because I'm dodging slower, I'm just getting caught in everything.
[44:45.67]I just want to find out.
[44:51.68]Moving to third dimension?
[45:17.15]I think two handed guy might not be a thing anymore.
[45:19.33]I haven't been hit one time.
[45:28.70]I say that and then I get hit.
[45:32.22]This is like a fucking dog shit dagger I haven't even upgraded one time.
[45:52.08]I'm doing, like, such little damage to him, and I'm doing way better than I was before.
[45:55.93]Like, he's shitting me.
[45:58.73]I don't get to B. Oh, I get hit by that one.
[46:02.83]Eat the grass.
[46:03.33]Are you kidding me?
[46:04.88]Eat the grass.
[46:10.24]I thought I jumped over it.
[46:27.21]What the fuck?
[46:32.08]Shit, that was a bad move.
[46:33.14]I shouldn't have done that.
[46:40.96]Come on.
[47:00.17]At least now I know what the problem was this whole time.
[47:04.36]Imagine if I was doing more than 8 damage a swing to this dude.
[47:08.28]Maybe I would actually kill him.
[47:38.53]Come on.
[48:09.03]I beat him first fucking try.
[48:10.27]I beat him first try, taking off my two hands.
[48:14.09]Fat rolling, you can't fat roll through with these fucking bosses in this fucking goddamn game.
[48:24.65]I just want everyone to understand what just happened right there.
[48:27.07]I put on a dirk and the chef clothing.
[48:30.31]And I beat him first try.
[48:34.65]What the hell have I done with my life?
[48:39.96]What the hell am I thinking?
[48:44.28]Well, back to the chef.
[48:53.73]Okay, let me put on some of the other things and see what happens.
[49:02.22]Do I still roll around like a dumbass?
[49:09.48]Just see.
[49:13.70]Yeah.
[49:18.08]Bullshit.
[49:18.86]I don't want to put a shield on.
[49:27.22]You know, I think I'm okay with this.
[49:29.62]I'll fight bosses with the dagger.
[49:34.98]I'll be heavy fat guy with the two-hander.
[49:38.41]Do I have any one-handed swords?
[49:43.49]Before I flip the fuck out.
[49:48.46]Pitchfork.
[49:50.88]I can't one-hand these two things.
[49:52.30]I can one-hand... Can this be one-handed?
[50:01.05]No, what the hell are you doing?
[50:06.35]No, I'm still rolling around like a dumbass.
[50:12.98]Do you still fat roll if you just are in chef's clothing with the big two-hander?
[50:26.11]Yeah.
[50:28.49]Oh, well.
[50:37.75]What if I tried to one-hand this?
[50:41.81]I'm okay.
[50:42.19]I'm okay being fat guy.
[50:43.29]Uh, how do I unequip this?
[50:50.11]Okay.
[50:51.85]I don't mind being big fat dude.
[50:54.35]I don't.
[50:54.61]I have a lot of... Actually, I need to level up.
[51:02.16]I should probably not do this, but, you know, I'm okay.
[51:04.74]Okay.
[51:10.12]Yeah, this is a dumb idea.
[51:11.02]What the hell am I thinking?
[51:13.71]Oh my fucking lord.
[51:14.67]I'm dead.
[51:15.49]What am I doing?
[51:17.51]What the hell am I doing?
[51:24.05]I could have just walked backwards.
[51:25.37]I hope he's not there again.
[51:41.28]Like, what on earth was I just thinking?
[51:43.38]Don't you know what this is?
[51:44.00]This is a Souls game.
[51:46.86]Don't!
[51:47.18]I almost had a heart attack.
[51:52.38]I thought it was going to drop.
[52:03.09]Wow.
[52:03.29]Okay, where are my Souls?
[52:06.03]Who has them?
[52:08.43]You have them, don't you, dummy?
[52:09.48]Okay.
[52:15.97]I got him back.
[52:19.92]Okay.
[52:20.72]Let's go level up.
[52:31.90]How long am I gonna stream for?
[52:34.46]Probably not that long.
[52:36.46]I have a video done.
[52:38.54]I just want to render it and get it ready for tomorrow.
[52:49.54]You thought the sun was German Mars?
[52:52.36]Wait a minute.
[52:53.86]Look again.
[52:56.30]What's over here?
[52:58.12]No, no, no, no, God, what are you thinking?
[53:01.31]Don't, just go back and... Can I go back?
[53:07.69]I don't even know the answer to that question.
[53:12.86]Yeah, I can.
[53:18.62]Except there's aliens in here.
[53:19.76]Can't even see them, but I guess they're dead.
[53:34.69]Shit.
[53:41.51]Because I really don't know, and I don't want to risk 7,000, I'm just going to take one of these.
[53:47.66]I'm going to use it right now because I seriously don't want to lose these.
[53:54.05]Trying to find the other way up there.
[53:55.55]Oh, 24.
[54:09.02]Hold on.
[54:13.53]Don't anyone want salt packets?
[54:16.49]Shit, I don't.
[54:18.21]Oh well.
[54:18.57]Hmm.
[54:33.37]Hmm.
[54:39.82]I guess I could go.
[54:41.26]What's up if I keep going?
[54:42.48]Strength, strength, strength.
[54:45.03]I'm going to put a couple points into dexterity.
[54:48.71]Because... With that revelation, that fat rolling is really horrible.
[54:56.18]I kind of want to just make sure I have a couple points in it.
[55:02.52]Dexterity is... Yeah, I'll go with a point in dexterity.
[55:10.49]I don't want to... I caught it early, so that's good to know.
[55:16.09]So at least I can use like deck scaling weapons and not want to, you know, sit on a thumbtack.
[55:30.48]I have one of these things.
[55:34.22]What are those for?
[55:35.26]The skull symbol?
[55:36.76]I picked one up.
[55:39.20]Is there some super move or something I can get eventually?
[55:48.37]I don't know.
[55:49.37]I'm not sure what it's for.
[55:50.33]Unless... No.
[55:59.07]Who's the doctor that says I have soup powers?
[56:00.59]What?
[56:00.87]Soup powers?
[56:03.84]Soup powers?
[56:06.26]What are you talking about?
[56:09.08]Soup powers?
[56:10.32]What are you talking about?
[56:11.16]Soup powers?
[56:17.79]Equipment load.
[56:18.84]Rogue's gauntlets.
[56:48.78]Okay, at least I'm, like, not a total slug.
[56:52.40]Alrighty.
[56:53.86]Where's that gonna go?
[56:54.50]That's gonna go to the right of... What's his name there?
[57:01.12]I'm gonna go over here.
[57:03.09]I'm gonna go this way.
[57:06.49]Because you know why?
[57:07.21]I feel like it.
[57:20.46]Crash.
[57:21.18]Smash.
[57:23.08]Remember Sanctuary to the right.
[57:24.82]Okay.
[57:25.50]Ha ha ha.
[57:28.78]What?
[57:31.54]Oh.
[57:32.94]I need the stupid candle.
[57:40.65]Ah!
[57:40.89]The French champagne.
[57:44.37]has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[57:47.19]Hey, laddie!
[57:49.29]596, five months.
[57:50.93]That is a long time to be subscribed.
[57:53.75]Why can I not put this here?
[57:56.54]Select icon.
[57:57.96]Isn't it selected right now?
[57:58.88]What's the deal here?
[58:02.48]Do I not have... Do I have to put a different idol here?
[58:10.97]Yeah, that's... Vacant Sanctuary.
[58:13.43]Why can I not...
[58:16.14]Yeah, okay, that's... I'm using the item.
[58:17.96]Why can I not select icon?
[58:21.64]What are you talking about?
[58:27.76]Uh... Huh?
[58:33.29]That's not the candle?
[58:34.79]Isn't that the candle?
[58:38.49]What about the clay pot?
[58:47.59]I don't know.
[58:48.63]Do I have to be like a certain covenant?
[58:49.79]I don't know.
[58:58.98]Not going to pretend to know.
[59:06.86]This is going to break.
[59:10.06]Oh.
[59:10.14]Oh.
[59:17.11]Shit, I'm in trouble.
[59:19.51]I'm in trouble here.
[59:22.69]What did I just pick up?
[59:30.42]God, it's so hard to navigate these menus.
[59:32.60]L1, R1, what is that bound to?
[59:37.22]Triangle.
[59:44.32]Nullifies elemental imbalance.
[59:49.60]Okay.
[59:52.83]Anything else over here?
[60:02.73]Do a funny voice.
[60:04.43]Hey, it's me.
[60:04.91]Do a funny voice.
[60:07.76]That'll be $500.
[60:25.57]Oh, get the high ground here.
[60:26.61]There's too many of them.
[60:28.79]They're doing tail whips.
[60:34.75]Any secret doors?
[60:41.94]Any secrets?
[60:47.06]Group them all up like that.
[60:47.90]That's the best way to deal with these aliens.
[60:56.06]He's the eyeball guy.
[60:58.34]Come on, he pounced me.
[61:02.07]Oh my lord.
[61:05.61]I'm so dead here.
[61:10.09]You can't even give me a second to heal.
[61:14.30]That is fucking obnoxious.
[61:17.92]If you have to heal, there's no way you're going to be able to kill those things unless you die.
[61:22.22]He's protected.
[61:25.37]The same place I died last time against that fucking stupid ass enemy.
[61:28.35]I'm obliterated.
[61:57.74]I wish I could see what the fuck was going on.
[61:59.88]Don't you guys wish you could see what was happening?
[62:05.27]Oh, that salt is flowing from my body right now.
[62:08.83]Alright, watch out.
[62:13.21]Watch out for the eyeball that protects people.
[62:15.09]I'm gonna kill that thing as soon as it shows up.
[62:26.05]You know what?
[62:26.33]I'm...
[62:27.91]See if I can pull, yeah.
[62:29.97]The three or four that appear out of nowhere.
[62:31.79]Where's the eye?
[62:44.13]Come on.
[62:44.59]Get over here.
[62:45.53]Alright.
[62:50.87]Alright, you stupid bloated asshole.
[62:55.75]I made the sound, but I buried him.
[62:56.82]Why did it not let me do it?
[63:02.72]Yeah, nobody to protect this time, huh?
[63:06.92]You're really that far out of my reach?
[63:10.07]Get over here!
[63:12.81]Come on!
[63:15.65]This guy's... Get over here!
[63:21.71]Ugh.
[63:22.91]Okay.
[63:23.35]That was so annoying.
[63:24.83]I'm glad nobody was around because I would have died.
[63:27.81]Absolutely would have died.
[63:39.55]What are you doing that to?
[63:40.35]I don't mind these things.
[63:49.38]Seems to be dodged.
[63:51.04]Oh my god.
[64:00.53]You just suck my ass.
[64:04.45]Who's gonna go first?
[64:05.11]You?
[64:05.77]You or me?
[64:06.92]You know what?
[64:07.28]I'm just gonna smash you with the hammer.
[64:08.30]Who cares?
[64:08.56]This is a new area.
[64:22.59]You are a new enemy.
[64:30.06]Stone mage.
[64:32.52]Huh.
[64:34.74]Um.
[64:38.96]I don't think I can go down there.
[64:45.72]I'm not sure I can go down there.
[64:47.26]Star is complaining about me?
[64:48.35]Why?
[64:49.55]What did I do?
[65:05.54]Sunken Key.
[65:06.12]Boy, it's like the next area.
[65:07.40]That's what I want to know.
[65:08.08]Am I in it right now?
[65:10.40]I guess I could just take the leap of faith.
[65:22.36]But I have 6,000 souls.
[65:24.16]When did that happen?
[65:24.92]Honestly.
[65:27.91]Honestly.
[65:29.53]When did that happen?
[65:31.43]Who was worth that much?
[65:33.11]I guess this is an area I haven't been to.
[65:34.65]Yeah.
[65:35.67]We'll try down here.
[65:38.81]Alright, guys.
[65:39.29]Well... Yes.
[65:42.35]There's no secret door right there?
[65:45.89]Bullshit.
[65:46.37]Damn.
[65:50.17]Okay, well... Is this a worse version of Bloodborne?
[65:58.64]I wouldn't say that.
[66:01.82]Better version of Bloodborne.
[66:02.92]Bloodborne is a fantastic video game.
[66:06.39]One of my favorites.
[66:11.59]I'll just go level up a couple times.
[66:12.85]Maybe go backwards.
[66:13.91]I feel like going backwards is the better idea.
[66:20.90]No, shit.
[66:21.54]I don't think... You know what?
[66:22.30]Now is the time.
[66:23.22]Now is the time.
[66:26.03]I want to go check over here to the left.
[66:32.20]Just curious what's over here.
[66:37.98]Okay.
[66:44.53]Not going back.
[66:49.11]Not these assholes again.
[66:50.19]Alright.
[66:59.69]Wish I didn't see him.
[67:04.54]Didn't even see him again.
[67:05.46]They blend in so well with these fucking trees.
[67:08.42]See, look!
[67:09.28]What is going on right now?
[67:11.32]Get off me!
[67:12.16]I'm getting poisoned.
[67:17.11]Elder Dan, I'm getting poisoned.
[67:28.61]Thanks a lot, Dan.
[67:29.91]Appreciate it.
[67:30.41]Welcome.
[67:35.35]I'm looking for the tree blenders.
[67:38.59]We blend in with the trees and we fall on some piece of sand.
[67:41.67]I see the evil in your eyes.
[67:45.02]But you know my Undertaker will destroy him at SummerSlam!
[67:51.26]Oh my goodness!
[67:51.94]Did you hear that?
[67:59.32]Yeah, I think I'm going to take off the pick.
[68:00.98]Thanks, Green Monster.
[68:03.04]Green Monster from Fenway Park.
[68:04.54]Just subscribed.
[68:05.14]Yeah, I think I'm going to take off the pictures because it impedes too much.
[68:15.66]I think maybe once or twice it might be funny.
[68:28.41]Is this where the scorpion guy was?
[68:38.29]I don't know.
[68:42.39]And here's this person.
[68:45.23]Yeah, well met.
[68:49.59]What do you even have?
[68:50.29]Do you even have anything I want?
[68:53.75]Nope.
[68:59.08]Okay, well, it was nice talking to you again.
[69:01.68]See you later.
[69:03.56]I think there was nothing over here, but did I even check for a secret wall?
[69:07.20]Always check for a secret room.
[69:13.43]Gives a good face to the voice.
[69:18.15]Am I mad right now?
[69:19.97]Yeah.
[69:26.11]That is not a permanent subsound, by the way.
[69:28.92]I just wanted to do it.
[69:29.56]Because we were talking about it last stream.
[69:32.00]Or a stream or two ago.
[69:32.94]And I was like, you know what?
[69:33.64]I'm going to do Paul Bearer today.
[69:39.18]I am lost as you could be.
[69:45.40]I am lost.
[69:52.64]I'm lost with a lot of salt.
[69:54.30]I don't want to lose it.
[70:00.19]I didn't die.
[70:00.77]I just tried to dodge it too and it didn't even...
[70:15.56]I think there is a sanctuary up here.
[70:19.18]If I remember.
[70:24.38]What?
[70:24.98]What?
[70:27.00]We'll just take another bone.
[70:28.02]Eat a homeward bone.
[70:31.93]I'm done.
[70:32.83]I don't care.
[70:34.75]I get a ton of these anyways.
[70:36.61]Let's go.
[70:43.90]I'm sick of looking around.
[70:44.76]I have too much salt.
[70:54.70]And... Tree is scalable.
[71:07.07]Hmm...
[71:15.57]um what do I want to do yeah I want to even this out because as we all know fat rolling is as awful in this game as it is in every other game that it is inspired by so you know
[71:48.72]Let's see if I can go to the next area.
[71:56.19]I think the next area actually... What is happening to my body?
[72:01.53]I knew it.
[72:02.33]I knew it was happening.
[72:03.01]I'm going to die in here.
[72:07.81]Already drinking a potion.
[72:09.89]It hasn't even been more than two seconds.
[72:16.78]I'm pretty sure this is the way I need to go.
[72:21.45]Take my energy, Jerry.
[72:24.38]I will.
[72:25.38]Thanks for the energy.
[72:27.26]Thanks for that five-hour energy shot.
[72:30.64]Do you feel tired at work?
[72:32.80]Groggy by 2 p.m.?
[72:35.02]Take the five-hour energy challenge.
[72:41.67]Just one sip, when you start to feel a little nauseous, it'll make you up and ready to go.
[72:49.81]Five-hour energy shot.
[72:51.96]You wanna see me ass?
[72:58.83]Pack of salt.
[73:02.35]Thanks for the bottles.
[73:06.25]You feel like Groggy at 2pm?
[73:10.36]Feels you up with all kinds of wonderful... goodness.
[73:21.93]Don't worry.
[73:23.13]They're only like five dollars.
[73:26.41]Five hour energy.
[73:27.97]A coffee is like a dollar fifty.
[73:30.67]Buy a five hour energy shot.
[73:32.40]For five fucking dollars.
[73:43.13]Did he stop?
[73:43.79]I hate the arrow guys.
[73:45.19]They're very annoying.
[73:57.10]Whatever.
[73:57.42]Screw those guys.
[73:58.06]Those guys are so salty.
[74:06.03]Boss?
[74:06.69]Boss?
[74:07.05]Right here.
[74:08.65]But is there a sanctuary?
[74:12.09]I'd like to know if there is a sanctuary around here.
[74:14.77]You can drink like three coffees for what it costs to buy one 5-hour energy.
[74:25.66]They might be a sanctuary rider.
[74:30.24]This weapon is hilarious.
[74:31.08]You like my meat tenderizer?
[74:35.72]It's a pretty good meat tenderizer if you want to have some chicken tenders or something.
[74:39.73]That was a key.
[74:42.53]And we're opening another door.
[74:44.93]So I think we may have gone the correct way.
[74:48.45]Maybe.
[74:50.57]And look at that.
[74:51.88]Here is a sanctuary.
[74:57.39]Can't level up at it, but can use it.
[75:02.71]Chain?
[75:05.91]I am all sorts of turned around right now.
[75:08.60]Am I going up even higher?
[75:10.42]Did I just come in this door?
[75:14.26]What is this?
[75:15.16]Who are you?
[75:18.88]Greetings, friend.
[75:19.48]You've come to chatter?
[75:20.30]From where I sit, you seem the matter.
[75:22.32]Fork, spoon, knife, and a drowned man's wife.
[75:26.04]You're a riddler, huh?
[75:27.88]Where I come from is... Where I come from, in is out, down is up, and up is down.
[75:33.83]Plate, cup, bowl, and a broken widow's soul.
[75:37.65]Did you like this rich perspective?
[75:39.46]Trust me, Lord, it's quite authentic.
[75:41.78]Doesn't rhyme.
[75:42.96]Elbow, jaw, knee in a grave beneath the sea.
[75:46.24]Yeah, sure.
[75:48.09]Fear not, then.
[75:48.69]Extend your hand.
[75:49.57]There is great power in a brand.
[75:50.99]Wide, searing, haunted, and iron-forged thought.
[75:54.67]Ooh, it burns!
[75:55.65]What did I just do?
[76:00.00]Vertigo brand?
[76:00.86]Oh, fuck.
[76:01.30]What have I done?
[76:02.78]What does that mean?
[76:06.52]Seek and find the hallowed stones.
[76:07.62]What comes next, I trust you'll know.
[76:08.88]Fate, faith, fade in the calm beneath the shade.
[76:11.13]I can use these things now, can't I?
[76:15.31]That's real-
[76:17.66]This just turned into a completely different video game.
[76:23.56]This is like an anti-gravity video game now.
[76:26.00]Oh, no.
[76:30.58]Okay.
[76:32.54]Well... What's in your... Is he gone?
[76:35.62]What's in this box?
[76:39.22]Oh, you... You didn't think I was gonna put this on?
[76:44.00]You didn't think I was going to wear this absolutely the rest of the game?
[76:54.71]Let's be honest here, guys.
[76:55.91]I have a feeling I can jump that.
[77:06.24]Come on, I know I can.
[77:07.83]I've played VVVVVVVVVVV.
[77:11.13]Come on.
[77:16.62]Come on!
[77:18.06]I know I can do the anti-gravity and fall up there.
[77:24.32]Maybe not.
[77:25.38]Dumb.
[77:26.22]Stupid.
[77:26.68]Dumb.
[77:30.07]I got up here.
[77:30.59]Okay, well.
[77:38.21]That is the way to do that.
[77:40.51]Get on the liberty bell.
[77:43.43]There.
[77:44.85]There.
[77:50.95]There's a shield.
[77:54.13]Secret window?
[77:54.89]Johnny Depp?
[77:56.11]No.
[78:00.76]I guess I could put a shield on, but I don't know if I want to.
[78:03.58]I don't like the idea of a shield.
[78:05.06]Yeah, this is the skip here.
[78:10.58]Because I remember coming all the way down here at the Festering Banquet and saying, gosh, golly, I wish I could
[78:19.48]Hello, friend.
[78:20.82]Trinkets to sell.
[78:21.92]Oh, really?
[78:24.37]What do you got?
[78:28.27]Ooh.
[78:29.85]This is the upgrade thing.
[78:33.51]These memories can be used by... You know what?
[78:35.25]I'll take... I'll take... I'll take a couple.
[78:42.20]I'll take three.
[78:44.36]I'll take four.
[78:44.92]Okay.
[78:46.54]Okay.
[78:48.33]Bye.
[78:49.07]Appreciate it.
[78:50.55]I love you.
[78:52.83]Bye, my love.
[78:57.65]Where the hell am I, though?
[79:00.71]I'm kind of at the beginning of the game, aren't I?
[79:01.95]Yeah, this is where... Yeah.
[79:06.42]I'm gonna go back.
[79:09.20]I don't need to be down here.
[79:11.38]Take my five-hour energy.
[79:13.54]Well, I just was looking over at my other monitor and...
[79:18.74]Wait, this is where the scorpion is?
[79:22.46]Yeah, this is where Scorpion Guy is.
[79:23.62]Alright, Scorpion Guy.
[79:24.38]I've had enough of you.
[79:25.64]We're gonna fight in the dark.
[79:38.41]Just like Daredevil.
[79:42.41]Guess I've seen Daredevil.
[79:50.08]I have.
[79:51.40]That's why I could do that.
[79:52.24]That's why I just did that flawlessly.
[79:53.54]I watched Daredevil on... What network is it on?
[79:59.60]Netflix.
[80:01.14]No, fuck that.
[80:01.88]The Ben Affleck one.
[80:03.42]That's the one that gave me all the power.
[80:10.93]No?
[80:12.47]That was not as hard as I thought it was going to be.
[80:19.16]Where else am I supposed to go?
[80:21.48]I gotta pee real bad.
[80:24.68]To a point where it is kind of starting to physically hurt my body.
[80:30.27]Ooh!
[80:30.45]I have a little obelisk.
[80:37.63]Ooh!
[80:39.83]Hello!
[80:40.49]Can I jump up here?
[80:43.84]Come on.
[80:45.98]Treasure chest.
[80:48.06]Onyx?
[80:51.20]At least, the good thing is I'm opening doors.
[80:53.73]I am opening a lot of doors.
[80:57.59]That's gonna be no good, though.
[81:06.25]Probably look at that, shouldn't I?
[81:09.70]Wasn't there another one out here?
[81:13.38]I feel like there are at least a couple out here that I saw.
[81:17.64]From previous adventures.
[81:19.44]Woodsman's Axe?
[81:31.87]A and A. Increases attack speed and attack reach.
[81:46.58]Attack speed.
[81:51.16]Will I still fat roll around?
[81:56.49]Am I fat rolling still?
[81:57.51]I seriously can't even tell.
[81:58.77]Is this some special property?
[82:03.89]I'm going to run around with this for a little bit.
[82:11.37]Just for fun.
[82:14.80]Yeah, this is the very beginning.
[82:15.76]This is the tutorial of the game.
[82:22.04]Bandit's Pass.
[82:22.62]But there was an obelisk somewhere around here.
[82:28.01]I swear.
[82:30.05]Up near the first boss.
[82:32.53]Am I crazy?
[82:33.25]Or is it like right here?
[82:34.09]Yeah, it's right there.
[82:34.93]I knew it.
[82:36.27]I knew it.
[82:40.01]What secrets were you telling me?
[82:45.32]Okay.
[82:49.24]Upside down.
[82:54.52]Bundle of salt and a storm ring.
[83:02.79]Storm Ring.
[83:07.24]Amplifies elemental magic, but also amplifies elemental imbalance.
[83:10.74]It's ineffective if paired with a ring that nullifies elemental imbalance.
[83:16.82]So it's a sorcerer of a ring or something.
[83:21.67]Spellcasting ring.
[83:27.91]Okay.
[83:29.75]Well, there's that.
[83:33.16]I got salt, too.
[83:42.08]I'm a long way from home right now.
[83:44.88]But it's okay.
[83:45.28]We get to re-see the game.
[83:47.08]We get to see all the cool parts of the game again.
[83:49.36]Remember this part.
[83:55.05]Hey, guys.
[83:55.41]Let's do a little stream rewind.
[83:57.87]Ready?
[83:58.07]Okay.
[84:00.35]Oh, what the fuck?
[84:01.13]I can't, these guys are blending in with the background.
[84:04.57]Oh, are you serious?
[84:05.97]How do you heal in this game?
[84:07.69]Stream Rewind, brought to you by 5-Hour Energy.
[84:11.01]Do you feel tired at work?
[84:13.13]Make sure you don't fucking die in the tutorial.
[84:18.26]Okay, no more fucking around.
[84:20.02]No more messing around.
[84:23.36]Just chug these things.
[84:30.46]Alright, I'm not a fan of the woodsman's axe.
[84:35.04]Fuck, I'm hitting him all the time.
[84:48.43]Cut his head off.
[84:56.19]I like the way the axe feels, but I don't like how it reaches very slowly in front of me.
[85:00.88]And by slowly, I meant to say there's not a whole lot of reach.
[85:09.94]I'm gonna take a real drink, because I don't want to be messing around back in these other zones and die.
[85:20.31]Step on his butt.
[85:21.73]That's easy enough.
[85:23.84]Okay, well...
[85:31.75]Just kind of doing this because I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[85:33.65]Because there are a bunch of secret obelisks.
[85:37.17]Back in these other areas.
[85:38.17]I remember having the same problem with this.
[85:39.52]Extreme rewind.
[85:40.86]Why can't I hit this box?
[85:42.16]What's going on?
[85:42.82]No, I'm going to just keep going to the right.
[85:55.44]There's another one.
[85:57.40]I knew I remembered these fucking things.
[86:01.46]There's a lot of other weird shit over here.
[86:03.54]Okay.
[86:11.93]Nothing over there?
[86:13.87]Come on, what?
[86:17.41]It's like a little door right here.
[86:20.85]What the hell is this?
[86:23.67]Locked.
[86:26.45]Of all the things that could be locked...
[86:33.00]I feel like I can just kind of go like, yeah, like that.
[86:40.36]Shockstone.
[86:41.22]Is that a spell?
[86:46.17]Rare and dangerous stone mined in the mountains of Murdoch.
[86:49.51]Pulses with electrical energy.
[86:51.43]Apply it to your weapon to add lightning damage.
[86:53.27]Okay, so it's just a lightning sheath.
[86:59.11]Secret doors, no, and a bunch of salt.
[87:00.85]I have a lot of bags of salt now.
[87:06.21]Let's do what this was intended to do, and it's go this way.
[87:08.83]I think this might be a new area.
[87:12.89]Castle of Storms.
[87:16.33]Okie dokie.
[87:16.81]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[87:24.84]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[87:38.84]Oh!
[87:40.36]Big shockwave.
[87:41.38]Big guy.
[87:42.16]Big scary guy.
[87:44.56]Um.
[87:46.66]Okay.
[87:47.46]Alright.
[87:47.82]This is turning into like Castlevania.
[87:52.06]Bye.
[87:52.30]Get me out of here.
[87:53.56]I'm not supposed to be here.
[87:56.42]See ya.
[87:58.54]Actually, no.
[87:58.92]Hold on a second.
[87:59.94]If I kill him right now, you know how much salt I'm gonna get?
[88:04.34]These stupid skulls.
[88:12.53]He's not supposed to be in this area.
[88:15.63]Can I even kill them?
[88:21.42]13 damage.
[88:23.56]That's probably not going to be enough to kill them.
[88:26.12]It is.
[88:29.36]Gotta take on this guy.
[88:35.76]Damn it.
[88:37.02]Alright, no, I'm not gonna try to parry him like I just did right there.
[88:39.24]Just dodge around tactically, tactfully, and get the kill.
[88:43.87]In fact, get... No, keep this on.
[88:51.25]Just axe murder.
[88:56.31]He has really strange animations.
[88:58.21]Like that.
[88:58.91]Oh, fuck.
[88:59.47]I aggroed the stupid skull men.
[89:01.03]Alright, time to go.
[89:02.99]Back to bed.
[89:04.61]As we say in the chat.
[89:19.79]I feel like I probably could kill that guy with the big thing.
[89:23.47]Hold on a second.
[89:24.15]We're gonna put on the big... Hold on.
[89:25.77]No, we're not.
[89:26.21]Yes, we are.
[89:26.59]I'm gonna put it on.
[89:28.11]Where is it?
[89:28.85]Where's my giant war hammer?
[89:34.02]Couple of swings of this thing, that guy's gonna be sleeping with the fishes.
[89:45.17]Where did he go?
[89:45.65]Oh, there he is.
[89:51.07]Where are you going?
[89:51.93]What are you doing?
[89:54.31]This guy's freaking me out.
[90:00.57]Will you please come back down here?
[90:01.79]Actually, you're being a dumbass right now.
[90:04.82]It's actually a good thing for me.
[90:05.90]He's gotta go.
[90:11.16]Bye, one.
[90:19.80]It wasn't as horrible as I thought it was going to be.
[90:22.17]Soldier's pump.
[90:22.79]Do I need that for something?
[90:23.57]I think I do need that for something.
[90:29.33]I think I just let that guy psych me out.
[90:31.33]I didn't have my super weapon on.
[90:41.23]Electricity.
[90:43.03]He got killed by it.
[90:46.62]Thank god that just happened because I definitely would not have made it through that alive.
[90:54.37]Is that gonna happen again?
[90:57.47]Thank god.
[91:01.62]Long winding staircase going up.
[91:05.22]New enemy.
[91:05.70]It's like a protoss from Starcraft.
[91:12.25]Holy shit, that's not cool.
[91:13.97]Holy God, he can teleport too.
[91:15.07]He needs to teleport around.
[91:16.89]I'm gonna have to just go and smash him, you know what I'm saying?
[91:25.56]When in doubt, use that technique.
[91:27.86]It works every other time.
[91:36.69]Getting to the point where I'm actually kind of scared because I have so much salt.
[91:45.81]This is a trap right here, but I don't know what it is.
[91:47.61]Just don't step on the plate.
[91:53.74]Grenade.
[91:54.24]I don't know where any of this is.
[91:57.74]I might have to take the hunter's mark.
[92:00.18]Whatever the hell it is.
[92:00.88]Whatever it's called in this game.
[92:09.75]No secret doors?
[92:12.33]Come on.
[92:12.73]There's always a secret door.
[92:17.76]I take one more hit and it's game over.
[92:19.30]I'm gonna have to, like, leave.
[92:25.04]See ya.
[92:27.16]Can I not climb up this?
[92:29.11]Alright, what is over here?
[92:29.97]Can I just go above him?
[92:30.89]I'm gonna go up.
[92:33.23]I'm just looking for a sanctuary.
[92:34.41]That's all I'm looking for.
[92:35.23]And a couple of these items.
[92:44.38]I'm too scared to try to make that jump.
[92:45.74]Woohoo!
[92:49.39]Bye.
[92:49.55]We're out of here.
[92:57.73]Okay.
[93:00.41]Now... This is where we started.
[93:05.73]I might drop from this.
[93:11.07]I'm going to pick this up.
[93:16.65]Get me off the ceiling.
[93:18.31]There we go.
[93:22.21]Stone Alchemist.
[93:28.78]Ow, right in the head.
[93:29.42]God, these traps are just everywhere right now.
[93:38.96]This trap city.
[93:39.98]Another one right here.
[93:42.02]Look, there's like five traps!
[93:51.16]Damn.
[93:58.19]What's a trap and what isn't a trap?
[94:02.23]I thought these guys are traps.
[94:04.75]Oh no, a fat guy.
[94:11.06]Thanks for putting me in a safe zone.
[94:18.67]I don't know what this... Let's... I'm gonna check.
[94:21.07]Make sure there's nothing over here before I do this.
[94:23.61]Because I don't know what this is going to do.
[94:25.81]This very well could kill me.
[94:28.45]Elevator, I'm gonna assume.
[94:32.27]Yes, it is.
[94:33.82]Let's go.
[94:36.28]Take me up!
[94:43.76]Stupid, dumb traps.
[94:50.73]I don't like this.
[94:53.83]Don't like this.
[94:54.61]Don't like this.
[94:55.23]Don't like this.
[94:55.79]Don't like this.
[94:58.95]Wait, was this the... This is the... That was the... Yeah, that was a scorpion, wasn't it?
[95:11.74]That was a scorpion guy.
[95:13.50]Back all the way over here?
[95:14.90]Yeah.
[95:19.07]Alright, I'm gonna die.
[95:20.15]I need to pee before I die.
[95:22.70]So, I'll be right back.
[95:25.14]Time to pee.
[95:26.42]Go pee.
[95:29.88]Hopefully I don't get snuck up on.
[97:25.39]Come in here, little dog.
[97:29.85]It smells like fruit punch in here.
[97:33.33]Why?
[97:33.59]I don't know.
[97:36.71]It smells like somebody cracked open a high C. Okay.
[97:54.80]I... need to... Good thing I'm still alive.
[98:02.45]That's always a plus.
[98:09.95]Oh my goodness, did you hear that?
[98:15.66]So, I'm gonna just ask the question.
[98:18.90]Where the hell am I supposed to go?
[98:21.82]How do I get back to where I was?
[98:24.72]I got so focused on doing this obelisk stuff that I forgot where to go.
[98:29.03]That's not gonna kill me, is it?
[98:33.27]Is this like a death drop?
[98:35.89]I don't know.
[98:37.36]Because this is the scary castle.
[98:43.68]Please don't be a death drop.
[98:44.70]Please don't be a death drop.
[98:45.92]Please don't be a death drop.
[98:46.78]Please don't be a death drop.
[98:47.64]It's a death drop.
[98:54.94]That was 8,000 souls!
[98:56.03]I thought it was grass.
[98:56.67]I was kind of like 60% sure.
[99:21.21]Where are my salts?
[99:22.81]Are they gone forever?
[99:24.19]Are they gone forever?
[99:25.05]I didn't even pay attention to the screen.
[99:26.17]Did it say they were gone forever or are they just there?
[99:43.10]Who the fuck is this guy?
[99:44.40]What is this?
[99:44.80]There's a jester in here.
[99:49.14]I don't know if this is true.
[99:57.53]Somebody just subscribed.
[99:58.41]I have no idea what's going on.
[100:00.75]I can't die here.
[100:02.49]If I die here, I lose all those souls.
[100:04.07]Hold on a second.
[100:04.67]Is everybody going to be quiet?
[100:05.58]I don't even have the right weapons on.
[100:14.01]Come on, Pulvera, give me the strength!
[100:28.09]Get fucking out of my way!
[100:32.41]Chicken!
[100:36.02]Chicken, you killed him!
[100:46.08]Okay, I gotta get my souls back.
[100:54.82]I can't believe it.
[100:55.42]I don't even know.
[100:56.02]I just beat the absolute shit out of that guy.
[101:02.43]That was the boss.
[101:03.01]That was the boss I was talking about before.
[101:05.21]That was the boss.
[101:08.41]Okay.
[101:09.63]Let's be clear-headed about this.
[101:15.11]Where did I fall?
[101:19.89]By the way, I didn't even say the person's name.
[101:21.67]Let me go up and see who it was.
[101:24.53]It gave me the strength to be able to take that.
[101:26.76]I was like hearing the crowd cheering and I felt like I was in the ring.
[101:36.72]Who was it?
[101:37.28]It was with a T. It was like try.
[101:40.65]Tritanics.
[101:42.45]Tritanics, thanks for subbing, man.
[101:44.55]Appreciate it.
[101:45.29]Much love.
[101:45.91]Much respect.
[101:48.84]So if that's the boss for there, then... All right, but I need to ask again.
[101:57.02]So it said... When I died, when I fell down, well, I didn't fall.
[102:03.72]Let's be clear about this.
[102:04.70]I didn't fall.
[102:06.16]I jumped.
[102:07.69]I had like a 62% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes that I was going to make that jump because I thought there was a ground there.
[102:17.23]But on the death screen, did it say the souls were gone forever?
[102:21.68]Was it in red text or did it say that they're like on the ledge over there?
[102:25.94]Because I'm probably going to have to, I need to go back and get those if they're there, if they actually exist.
[102:30.50]I didn't lose them.
[102:31.06]Okay.
[102:33.00]So that was back in a place that I don't even remember.
[102:39.41]Because this is here.
[102:47.07]Castle is the next area you're supposed to go.
[102:48.71]Okay.
[102:50.81]So... It was like... Was it up... Obelisk by the castle?
[102:55.62]I don't even... Like... It's apparently... I think it was this way, right?
[103:05.70]Was it down there?
[103:07.58]I'm losing track.
[103:08.16]That, like, Jester fight really might have just given me diarrhea.
[103:12.58]I'm not kidding.
[103:13.00]Did I even use this one?
[103:22.85]Let's do it again.
[103:26.95]Okay, this is looking sort of familiar.
[103:37.17]I see the evil in your eyes!
[103:38.43]You know... My undertaker will destroy him!
[103:45.05]Um...
[104:03.73]I feel like I'm in the slightly correct area, but not really.
[104:10.10]Bandit's Pass.
[104:10.94]Yeah, it was over here, but I don't remember where the fuck it was.
[104:14.60]Yeah, okay, I remember walking by this and saying, I don't care, lady, see ya.
[104:23.96]Yeah, I remember, I made, like, the stream joke.
[104:26.35]Hey, we're gonna do, like, a stream rewind.
[104:27.95]Okay, I remember the second stream rewind.
[104:33.38]I very clearly could be... What am I... Just go!
[104:37.46]I'm gonna die here.
[104:38.88]I'm gonna die.
[104:39.26]Alright, hold up.
[104:43.60]Let me just drink this.
[104:44.34]Okay, right here, right?
[104:53.79]There they are.
[104:55.33]There are my souls.
[104:56.87]On an evil bat.
[104:59.39]Let's make this happen.
[105:06.41]Okay.
[105:08.29]I have 16,000 souls.
[105:10.25]I can't... I don't... I can't go down there, so I have to go over here.
[105:24.74]Am I even supposed to be going this way, though?
[105:26.60]Hmm.
[105:38.77]I feel like this area is a little too high for me.
[105:40.69]I need a... something.
[105:57.43]I am supposed to be here, apparently.
[105:59.59]Well, let's hope I don't die.
[106:00.81]You know what I mean?
[106:14.43]I'm going to take this really slow because I am going to have so much salt.
[106:18.95]It's kind of a joke.
[106:21.39]I'm going to slowly kill every enemy.
[106:28.54]No nonsense.
[106:32.44]Naked guy.
[106:33.06]Watch out for the naked people.
[106:42.32]Oh, everybody.
[106:44.41]No one can survive this.
[106:56.81]Skulls.
[107:00.87]Guy doing the circus act.
[107:03.53]He's dead.
[107:08.41]This is the dude with the lightning.
[107:09.43]Just come step on it.
[107:11.33]And I'll... You know, I'll step on it.
[107:12.97]That didn't kill him?
[107:15.13]Come on.
[107:15.49]It would have killed me.
[107:19.70]Still not dead?
[107:21.96]Already got the item that's over there.
[107:24.74]Alright, because I remember going over there and being scared.
[107:30.94]So let's just take a look up here.
[107:33.06]There's a way to go.
[107:39.57]Did I go in this... I don't think I went in here.
[107:40.87]Yeah, I was scared of the lightning.
[107:44.05]I remember the lightning giving me spooks.
[107:52.96]Really?
[107:53.26]That's not, uh... That's not what I wanted to see happen.
[107:57.86]It's too dark!
[108:07.23]It's dark BS.
[108:11.29]Is this a tree or something?
[108:12.75]What is this tree?
[108:14.47]Let's cut it down.
[108:17.99]What the hell was that?
[108:18.85]What is going on?
[108:19.43]Why was there a random tree there?
[108:23.73]This obviously is not open.
[108:37.02]Ray of Searing.
[108:37.78]I'm getting a lot of spells that I don't really know what to do with.
[108:43.72]Take a peek.
[108:48.00]Uh, an obelisk.
[108:54.83]Use castle jump.
[108:57.41]Need brand.
[108:58.15]Kill monster.
[109:02.66]Huh?
[109:05.80]Use the castle jump?
[109:08.18]Where's my castle jump move?
[109:17.80]Wouldn't that be under spells or something?
[109:24.56]I don't know where that is exactly.
[109:27.44]I'm not sure.
[109:34.15]Mend ray of searing blessed weapon.
[109:39.91]I don't know.
[109:42.89]I don't know.
[109:53.42]Interesting.
[109:53.88]I think I have to go the way where that big scary dude was.
[110:08.88]Although... How do I activate that?
[110:14.58]Don't tell Jerma about the tree?
[110:15.64]What do you mean, don't tell me about the tree?
[110:16.68]What are you talking about?
[110:17.32]Don't tell me about the tree.
[110:23.77]Actually, you know, I want to see what's over on this side.
[110:29.50]Did I go this way?
[110:31.24]Which one was I scared of?
[110:32.62]I think I was scared of this one.
[110:34.57]Yeah, I was, because there's a big guy in here with the skulls.
[110:51.85]Do I have the key?
[110:53.08]I don't have the key for this room, so I'm not supposed to go this way.
[111:03.52]Don't tell him anything.
[111:04.52]You guys have played this game in the past.
[111:06.94]I know it's dog shit.
[111:10.75]I know the tree didn't do anything.
[111:14.41]It didn't do anything.
[111:15.35]I'm okay.
[111:20.85]I'm okay.
[111:23.25]That could have been real bad.
[111:29.89]Press the ring.
[111:33.25]Increase your defense to fire damage.
[111:35.75]Cool.
[111:36.59]I think I need it right now.
[111:43.93]I don't want to do that.
[111:49.67]Where is the sanctuary here?
[111:57.61]I can't even come up.
[111:58.46]I can't grab this ledge.
[111:59.28]I'm clipping through.
[112:00.14]I can't grab the ledge.
[112:02.20]My head is going through the bottom.
[112:05.74]I have to jump down.
[112:08.08]I have to.
[112:11.89]Say your prayers, guys.
[112:12.59]Really.
[112:13.07]Say your prayers.
[112:13.65]There are stairs right there.
[112:16.69]You see the stairs?
[112:22.60]I can't use the bell.
[112:24.14]If I use the bell, I'm gonna go back to, like, before I even got here.
[112:30.46]I'm doing it!
[112:31.68]We're good.
[112:32.02]We're fine.
[112:32.48]God, what were you guys worried about?
[112:37.15]But it doesn't... Can't drop down here.
[112:41.45]Actually, I can go up this way.
[112:47.32]I don't... If I ring the bell, it's gonna fuck up everything.
[112:49.56]I'm gonna go all the way back.
[112:58.95]The goal here is just don't die.
[113:00.15]Just don't lose.
[113:03.35]There's a guy right here.
[113:04.41]He's going to help me out.
[113:05.03]He's going to be like, Thanks for coming.
[113:06.76]Here's your bill.
[113:09.62]You made it.
[113:10.10]See?
[113:11.18]Look at this view.
[113:11.82]Stunning, isn't it?
[113:13.54]I've heard there's a thief somewhere with what sounded like a particularly useful rune.
[113:18.83]Also, that pesky dragon needs to be slain.
[113:21.05]Ever wonder where those buildings came from?
[113:24.31]Who built this castle?
[113:25.13]Does it have a master?
[113:27.41]Not really.
[113:30.71]Not really.
[113:31.29]I feel like that's a big skip.
[113:40.98]See, now if I ring the bell, it's not a huge deal.
[113:44.14]You guys are just trying to get me to die.
[113:46.14]So everyone can put baby rage and salt pictures into the chat.
[113:52.62]This is going to take me to a safe place.
[113:54.56]See?
[113:55.74]Would you look at that?
[113:58.76]See?
[114:00.82]Now I can use the bell.
[114:02.16]I don't even need to use the bell.
[114:05.36]Go right over here.
[114:08.84]You guys.
[114:12.20]Kieran!
[114:15.16]Thanks for subbing.
[114:20.12]I love the laugh.
[114:31.65]Did you hear that?
[114:33.27]Thanks, Gareth.
[114:34.67]Welcome to the subscriptions.
[114:37.21]Thanks for subbing.
[114:38.28]Enjoy your emotes.
[114:39.48]Your three emotes.
[114:40.52]There'll be more.
[114:41.40]Don't worry.
[114:41.86]There'll be more.
[114:42.44]Don't worry.
[114:44.54]There'll be more.
[114:45.18]Eventually here.
[114:46.32]There'll be more.
[114:49.66]Is everyone actually spamming salt and baby rage in the chat right now?
[114:57.73]You see what happened?
[114:58.91]And look it.
[114:59.75]I ended up doing the thing that I was supposed to do.
[115:03.25]Now we've got... Look at all the shit we can do here.
[115:07.41]Everyone wanted me to die.
[115:08.83]Everyone was like, I can't wait to watch German die.
[115:11.98]Well, look at this.
[115:12.44]I'm gonna stomp on this nuts.
[115:16.92]Assault.
[115:17.66]Did I say nuts?
[115:19.30]Why did I think it was like a bag of walnuts?
[115:22.22]Look, a sack of salt.
[115:23.20]This is gonna be like a thousand.
[115:26.73]Eight hundred.
[115:37.51]Bag assault.
[115:38.11]Which is the biggest?
[115:38.93]Bag?
[115:39.33]Sack?
[115:43.83]Alright, let's level up a shitload of times.
[115:52.39]I'm gonna be able to level up like seven or eight times.
[115:59.41]So satisfying when you just level the fuck up.
[116:07.85]See, it all worked out.
[116:09.45]It all worked out in the end.
[116:19.29]This is insane how many times I'm leveling up.
[116:24.49]I have so much money, too.
[116:27.27]God, I'm so loaded, guys.
[116:28.87]Okay, what do I have for... What do I have for...
[116:36.55]L2 is L2.
[116:37.43]Okay.
[116:39.15]Endurance.
[116:41.35]Willpower.
[116:41.99]Dexterity.
[116:42.83]I need a couple more points in dexterity.
[116:47.68]I wonder if there are soft caps in this game.
[116:49.96]And whatever they are, what they are.
[116:51.08]I don't know.
[117:00.32]I do have a shitload of points I can put in, though.
[117:04.26]Let's do a little more strength.
[117:06.54]Because why the hell not?
[117:09.06]Because I can do a potion right here.
[117:12.32]Boink!
[117:15.30]Which is always a good thing.
[117:16.54]More pots.
[117:20.81]I now have, what, six or five?
[117:28.47]Endurance, dexterity...
[117:33.82]Alright.
[117:35.96]I'm in an okay spot right now, I think.
[117:37.84]I think I'm doing okay.
[117:39.20]Okay is the word there.
[117:41.84]I got a new potion.
[117:44.21]We can go slay the dragon.
[117:45.99]Because that's definitely what the next boss is.
[117:48.43]Upstairs.
[117:54.31]That guy.
[117:55.55]I killed that guy so bad.
[118:01.82]Get out of my way.
[118:03.77]I still haven't used those stone statues.
[118:05.49]You know, I'm going to have to take a minute here eventually.
[118:10.50]Figure out what all this shit does.
[118:11.66]Those stone statues and whatnot.
[118:30.51]What do we have here?
[118:35.28]Nothing.
[118:37.00]Nothing.
[118:37.28]It's a bunch of nothing.
[118:42.16]Praise the blood!
[118:45.73]Hunters, gloves, hunters.
[118:47.73]Okay.
[118:59.20]The jester stuff kind of sucks.
[119:04.50]This is heavy armor, though.
[119:05.60]I don't want to put it on.
[119:06.56]Actually, the jester stuff is not even that bad.
[119:10.20]It's actually pretty good.
[119:13.64]Cotton tunic.
[119:17.65]Well, a lot of strike defense.
[119:21.75]Yeah, heavy armor.
[119:30.74]Cotton tunic really isn't even that bad.
[119:34.80]But we'll keep the jester stuff on.
[119:36.50]And we'll see if the dragon... Oh, well, you know, it is a dragon.
[119:40.56]I just thought about this.
[119:43.58]Yeah.
[119:44.71]It is a dragon.
[119:46.65]Fingers are going to point to there being fire coming out of this dragon's mouth.
[119:53.49]It is a dragon.
[119:56.79]Fire.
[120:00.61]Class 1 light armor?
[120:01.73]Oh, it's class 1.
[120:04.78]Eleven.
[120:05.20]Eight.
[120:07.86]This is the best one.
[120:09.40]That's heavy armor, though.
[120:10.42]I think the chef's... No, this is better.
[120:20.65]Fire, fire, fire.
[120:22.19]Fire, fire, fire.
[120:23.15]Blacksmith gloves.
[120:24.37]Blacksmith gloves would be light armor.
[120:25.73]That's weird.
[120:29.25]All the things you would expect.
[120:30.09]I think a blacksmith would be heavy.
[120:36.38]Alright.
[120:37.66]I'm ready to fight a dragon.
[120:41.62]Come on, try to.
[120:42.32]You try to burn me.
[120:43.98]See what happens.
[120:44.62]You punk.
[120:57.29]Got ya.
[121:04.61]Stone guy.
[121:12.57]Oh no, a magician.
[121:13.55]I kind of don't care.
[121:16.19]Oh, there's a person up there.
[121:29.36]Hey!
[121:30.84]Hey!
[121:38.59]I was walking a straight line here.
[121:42.93]Ooh, look at that.
[121:44.49]Boink.
[121:49.33]Six.
[121:50.58]Count them.
[121:51.16]Six water blessings.
[121:59.68]Silver leaf.
[122:04.78]Anything over here?
[122:05.37]Ooh, there is a bit over here.
[122:07.63]There is a chest.
[122:08.15]It was blending in.
[122:09.83]Stone merchant.
[122:14.10]Fuck if there's no jump sounds in this game, you know what I mean?
[122:15.81]Like... Dragon.
[122:27.46]Kraken wing.
[122:29.58]Looks pretty docile.
[122:35.20]Hit him right in the face.
[122:45.65]I'm kind of kicking his ass.
[122:47.69]Fire!
[122:47.89]I told you I was gonna need fire protection!
[122:59.74]Shit, he's flying in the air.
[123:00.54]I don't know what he's doing.
[123:02.82]Where's he going?
[123:03.46]What's happening?
[123:04.30]Is he gonna land?
[123:05.41]Where's he landing?
[123:10.55]Wow.
[123:10.63]He's gonna do it again.
[123:16.64]Where is he going?
[123:17.22]What part of the screen is he gonna come from?
[123:23.10]Come on, he just did that move, he just did it!
[123:32.77]Shit!
[123:33.37]Come on, give me the first try!
[123:35.15]Give it to me!
[123:37.73]He did the tail swipe that time, not fair.
[123:39.81]I think I'm gonna get him.
[123:44.37]He's gonna fly by and I'm gonna catch him right in his mouth.
[123:48.05]It's okay.
[123:50.53]Got him.
[123:54.55]Fire resistance?
[123:56.60]Uh, yeah.
[124:02.10]If I didn't have all that fire resistance on, I might have not done that.
[124:05.40]There we go.
[124:15.00]That's the first try kill.
[124:16.06]We can now take off all this fire resistance.
[124:18.66]Let's go back to the Jester.
[124:21.26]Because I like it.
[124:27.97]That's better.
[124:35.51]I like these.
[124:39.01]Okay.
[124:42.76]I got a horn, too.
[124:45.01]What does the horn do?
[124:49.06]Did I pick up a new weapon?
[124:52.00]What do I mean, like, shit?
[124:54.20]Did I get a new weapon?
[124:55.00]Shit.
[124:59.58]Shit.
[125:05.70]Where's that horn?
[125:06.36]What even is it?
[125:07.86]Is it a ring?
[125:11.28]Mending band.
[125:11.86]Regenerate HP.
[125:14.51]Let me take a close look at these rings, because seriously... I don't even know if I'm wearing the ones that I should be wearing.
[125:21.96]Okay, this is... Increases salt obtain.
[125:28.66]Like it.
[125:29.80]Reduces wounding effect.
[125:32.53]Not sure.
[125:33.77]Defense to arcane.
[125:35.57]Increases rolling speed.
[125:37.01]Get these all off.
[125:45.81]Salt one.
[125:48.37]Rolling speed.
[125:51.01]Willpower.
[125:51.63]I don't care about that right now.
[125:55.81]Okay, wounding.
[125:57.98]Arcane defense.
[126:00.74]Habs effective focus.
[126:02.00]I don't know what the fuck that means.
[126:04.04]Regenerate HP.
[126:08.70]Where was the willpower one?
[126:11.74]Because willpower is... Yeah, I like the willpower one.
[126:17.77]What did I take off?
[126:18.50]I didn't even have the fire ring on.
[126:23.26]Yeah, okay.
[126:23.66]I like this ring setup right now.
[126:27.22]Not bad.
[126:28.76]It's not bad.
[126:29.22]I like it.
[126:34.21]Okay.
[126:42.77]It should regenerate HP.
[126:43.97]Okay.
[126:47.05]In a moment.
[126:49.53]New area.
[126:52.17]Come on, bring it on.
[126:55.59]I'm all over this right now.
[126:58.39]Ah, look, it's the person I could play with.
[127:00.45]Right?
[127:01.49]Oh, hello.
[127:01.89]Do you want to play a game of hide-and-cheek?
[127:03.83]Why am I just sitting here?
[127:05.55]I'm the best.
[127:05.89]Oh, there's the thief.
[127:06.87]This is the thief that they were telling me about.
[127:10.45]What can a thief do against a dragon?
[127:11.71]A dagger against a worm scale?
[127:13.01]No.
[127:13.23]I already killed a dragon.
[127:14.11]Don't worry, you're fine.
[127:17.46]Yeah.
[127:18.34]I did slay the dragon.
[127:19.98]Well, you've done that.
[127:20.58]Maybe someone like me can slay mighty monsters as well.
[127:23.42]Here, take this brand.
[127:24.44]It'll hurt.
[127:26.02]But it's too cruel.
[127:27.86]But it's a tool crucial to a thief.
[127:36.62]Shadow flip brand?
[127:40.05]Hmm?
[127:42.25]What does that do?
[127:47.63]Thanks.
[127:47.87]Thanks for the free shit.
[127:50.51]Whatever it is you just did.
[127:53.81]Okay, I can wall jump now.
[127:57.10]That's what it was.
[128:00.46]Okay.
[128:04.30]Well.
[128:06.48]Sure.
[128:10.97]Sure thing.
[128:15.89]Whoa, easy.
[128:18.95]Easy, guys.
[128:19.89]Is this Ringling Brothers?
[128:28.76]Please don't kill me with that!
[128:30.20]I almost died.
[128:31.56]I almost died.
[128:34.32]You know how embarrassed I would have been?
[128:39.37]I would have gone on most embarrassing moments.
[128:46.56]Is there anything else I can do here?
[128:50.31]No.
[128:53.17]Nah.
[128:55.39]Hey.
[128:57.25]Nah.
[129:08.81]Let's go level up.
[129:30.56]This thing isn't even upgraded either.
[129:35.58]Not even upgraded.
[129:36.42]There's another person.
[129:38.22]I don't understand what these... What are you doing here?
[129:43.10]Is that another player?
[129:45.34]Can he see me?
[129:45.92]That guy's creepy looking.
[129:49.79]He's like a vampire.
[129:50.57]Oh, whatever.
[129:56.17]Let's do it.
[130:02.57]Hope everything went well with the doctor.
[130:05.36]Inconclusive at the moment, but, you know, at least my blood work didn't show any kidney problems, which is a good thing.
[130:14.68]That is a good thing.
[130:21.78]Potion right here.
[130:26.00]Let's get another potion.
[130:36.20]Stamina... I went to the point in strength.
[130:39.78]Can I?
[130:40.24]Yeah, right here.
[130:44.26]Still haven't figured out what the other... What the black pearl thing is for.
[130:49.46]Not the black pearl, the... The skull, like the silver-looking skull?
[130:52.64]What is that?
[130:53.86]Stop slouching shit, you got me, dude.
[130:56.44]Yeah, it was.
[130:56.98]I was slouching.
[131:03.04]But...
[131:04.92]I kind of want to go to the blacksmith and upgrade this hammer.
[131:07.58]Because it's slow as shit and it's awful to roll around like a dumbass sometimes.
[131:13.62]But it does so much damage.
[131:17.44]Did the doctor suggest an MRI?
[131:19.66]Not yet.
[131:21.12]Because we're not exactly sure what the hell is going on.
[131:28.58]So, once I figure out... Once we have a more conclusive...
[131:34.00]estimate of what's actually going on.
[131:39.85]Kind of just sitting here killing these things.
[131:45.66]How long am I gonna be streaming for?
[131:46.68]Uh, maybe like another hour.
[131:52.26]Because I do want to get to bed.
[131:54.80]So I can get up early tomorrow.
[131:58.59]I've been like... Every day has been something doing.
[132:02.03]Otto had to go to the vet.
[132:04.61]I've been doing like tax stuff.
[132:08.03]I had to go to the doctor.
[132:09.03]It's just every day has been something else this last like four days.
[132:11.78]What are they looking for?
[132:16.86]My back is like all screwed up for some reason.
[132:20.48]A reason I cannot explain.
[132:36.69]It's like a weird, deep, lower back pain that I've never had before.
[132:42.57]Just decided to start happening.
[132:49.88]Did I miss anything in here?
[132:50.68]I did get the wall jump, which maybe that can do something.
[132:56.06]They can use it somewhere.
[133:09.69]Did I already go up here?
[133:10.83]I did, but... I feel like they wouldn't give me that jump unless I need to use it somewhere in this area to get to the next area.
[133:16.97]Ooh.
[133:19.66]You see that?
[133:22.90]Proceed to thy death.
[133:25.44]Okay, look, I can... Grasping ring.
[133:37.97]So what is down here?
[133:40.99]Oh.
[133:42.45]What's a grasping ring do?
[133:46.54]Increases so... Ooh!
[133:49.50]Okay, which one of these do I not care about?
[133:53.48]Rolling speed.
[133:54.20]I kind of like that.
[133:58.86]Maybe the HP one.
[133:59.62]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[134:00.76]Look at it.
[134:01.04]It's barely doing anything.
[134:02.19]I want extra salt.
[134:04.69]Yeah, we just ordered a thing of onion rings and I got extra salt.
[134:13.97]Is this just a 2D Bloodborne?
[134:15.31]It's very heavily inspired.
[134:17.68]Heavily, heavily, heavily inspired.
[134:26.46]It is inspired.
[134:28.14]Okay, where the fuck am I going?
[134:33.64]Let's be real here.
[134:36.08]I need to find a spot where I can do that jump.
[134:43.03]I haven't really figured that out yet.
[134:45.95]This is some spot way back.
[134:51.65]It's one of the other areas that I just don't, I can't put my mind on at the moment.
[134:55.19]I'm gonna assume that's what it is.
[134:59.70]Is there something over here from the dragon?
[135:09.06]Okay, why does it say three viewers resubscribed while you were away?
[135:14.80]Did they?
[135:18.48]I guess.
[135:18.90]I don't know.
[135:22.05]What's up with that?
[135:22.53]Did the stream turn off or something?
[135:28.87]I don't think so.
[135:36.98]Yeah, I'm not really sure where to go.
[135:43.53]I mean, that.
[135:46.15]Another charm.
[135:50.44]Adds fire damage to your attacks.
[135:52.22]Ooh.
[135:53.70]How much?
[135:56.68]But by how much?
[136:03.79]What's with the ghost platform?
[136:06.01]You see that?
[136:07.91]What does that do?
[136:08.61]Can I jump on this?
[136:09.75]No.
[136:24.03]Alright, I definitely have to go back.
[136:33.18]Definitely need to go back.
[136:41.96]Let's just drop down.
[136:48.33]There's something over here.
[136:49.91]What an exciting, exciting stream I'm doing right now.
[136:55.15]Walking back and forth to places I've seen five times.
[137:02.32]Play some Stardew Valley?
[137:05.16]No, I'm not.
[137:07.20]Ooh, found it.
[137:08.84]Found it.
[137:11.44]Found the thing I needed to find.
[137:14.20]Interesting.
[137:14.76]Ah, the French champagne.
[137:19.34]Princess Awesome.
[137:20.26]Celebrated for its excellence.
[137:24.00]Thanks for subbing Princess Awesome.
[137:25.34]Thanks for re-subbing.
[137:27.80]For five months.
[137:31.95]Very much appreciated.
[137:32.69]Thank you.
[137:39.39]That just brought me all the way back down.
[137:41.99]Talk to the girl?
[137:42.47]I already did.
[137:43.38]She gave me the super jump.
[137:48.18]This is something in this area I can do.
[137:58.34]Oh, this looks like I can do this.
[138:02.91]Very cool.
[138:08.71]Well, that's new.
[138:10.75]Isn't it?
[138:14.18]And there's a person over here.
[138:15.54]Hello?
[138:17.18]What does that do?
[138:25.61]Should I buy some of this shit?
[138:39.16]Maybe I should.
[138:41.22]Look at how much money I have.
[138:48.45]I'm going to buy a couple things.
[138:49.71]I have so much money.
[138:51.03]What else am I going to spend this shit on?
[138:59.90]I don't even know what this is, but I'm going to buy one.
[139:02.40]I don't know what it is, but I'm buying one.
[139:03.84]Don't know.
[139:04.18]I'm going to buy two.
[139:07.83]Let's buy two.
[139:09.51]Who cares, right?
[139:11.81]Thanks.
[139:23.09]And there's a thing to pull.
[139:25.57]Ooh, that's where I gotta go.
[139:29.49]One and a two and a three and a four and a five.
[139:35.31]All right.
[139:37.54]Very nice.
[139:40.32]Very nice.
[139:40.88]That's a new weapon.
[139:48.28]Shrimshrocane.
[139:52.82]That's magic.
[139:55.36]It's a staff.
[139:56.44]Whatever.
[139:59.12]I'm okay with the super hammer at the moment.
[140:01.14]Anything else up there?
[140:02.32]Can I do a double jump?
[140:05.64]No.
[140:10.55]The sun god?
[140:11.93]God.
[140:12.25]I feel like I'm going to get ambushed down here.
[140:20.73]No.
[140:21.27]Apparently not.
[140:25.63]Well, that was all just for show.
[140:26.85]Okay.
[140:27.95]More, more, more.
[140:32.71]More.
[140:34.89]Red hull of cages.
[140:37.03]It's gonna be red, and it's gonna be cages.
[140:41.30]Like that one.
[140:41.80]I thought people just eat such shit with this weapon.
[140:54.09]I have to upgrade this.
[140:56.47]I've killed the last three bosses with this thing.
[141:00.61]By just being aggressive.
[141:02.91]I was doing all the dodgy... Let's be fair though.
[141:06.09]That Cyclops boss was pretty difficult.
[141:11.18]He was.
[141:11.50]There was a lot of successful combos he was doing.
[141:21.80]It's a new enemy.
[141:28.51]They're kicking everybody's ass.
[141:31.54]Like seriously, everybody's getting destroyed.
[141:43.06]I can't say that this is my favorite feature, this is just odd.
[141:53.67]Eventually I'm gonna have to go down.
[141:58.07]Right?
[141:58.35]I mean... The jester was just up there.
[142:03.13]Well, I want to get this stuff.
[142:15.72]Light armor.
[142:18.84]Okay, kind of look like a moron.
[142:24.16]We'll change.
[142:26.87]Yeah, it'll change.
[142:27.62]You get a little bit more defense.
[142:32.80]Now I look like an executioner.
[142:34.06]This is actually kind of cool.
[142:38.71]There's something else over here.
[142:40.97]All these spells.
[142:41.69]That I don't use.
[142:44.61]I didn't go this way, did I?
[142:52.08]No.
[143:01.07]Poison bolts.
[143:02.65]Nice.
[143:05.31]This fire charm is eating people up as well.
[143:13.77]Type 46 tower shield.
[143:17.62]And... the spider thing from Toy Story.
[143:20.34]Look at him, he's just fottin' around.
[143:23.76]Are you serious?
[143:24.26]Get over here.
[143:28.52]Shit still stays.
[143:33.67]I thought that's a clay phantom's ass.
[143:36.47]I'd say rude.
[143:37.87]That's not very nice.
[143:41.19]Okay, if I fall, I fall down for sure.
[143:45.01]Like all the way down.
[143:50.18]Wow.
[143:51.48]I gotta... Parry this guy.
[144:03.16]Why?
[144:03.92]Why?
[144:05.10]Why would I try to parry him?
[144:06.62]I've been obliterating people this whole time.
[144:08.80]What the fuck would I do that for?
[144:15.95]Just fucking hit him.
[144:16.95]What the hell was I doing that for?
[144:18.75]Seriously.
[144:19.63]God, get your head out of the clouds.
[144:22.13]God dang.
[144:24.27]And now I'm all the way back here.
[144:31.74]There was no... I'm all the fucking way back.
[144:33.58]I'm about to rage quit the stream.
[144:34.96]I was doing, like, perfectly fine.
[144:48.07]And I decided that I want to try to parry these guys.
[144:51.71]Oh, by the way, that's an enemy that I just saw for the first time.
[144:56.35]It's a good idea for me to just put myself in danger and try to parry an enemy I don't know what they do or their patterns.
[145:04.64]I'm just going to give myself a spanking.
[145:13.73]Scratch that from a record.
[145:14.65]I never said that.
[145:33.72]It's over by the giant guy.
[145:46.36]Where's the giant guy?
[145:48.32]Down there?
[145:57.43]Maybe I'm tired.
[145:58.15]Maybe I am tired.
[146:05.70]Where is that stupid area to go?
[146:07.30]No, I had to go down the... I don't think this is the right way.
[146:19.25]No, I think, yeah, it is.
[146:24.43]Okay.
[146:27.08]I'm going to have a lot of skulls fall on me.
[146:31.88]I don't care about you.
[146:35.47]Get me back to where I was.
[146:36.53]Are you guys seriously all coming over here?
[146:41.35]This guy is freaking me out.
[146:42.95]And they're going through walls.
[146:47.55]Fuck off.
[146:48.11]Just stay up there.
[146:50.49]It's alright.
[146:51.73]We're fine.
[146:52.54]We're okay.
[146:58.29]this time.
[147:00.35]Don't do that thing called be a dumbass.
[147:04.59]Be nice.
[147:06.83]Be swell.
[147:21.86]What are you doing over there?
[147:32.14]No, what are you doing?
[147:33.16]He's like... He's like, what are you chewing on?
[147:37.26]You're chewing on his butt.
[147:38.40]Stop chewing your butt!
[147:39.60]What are you chewing your butt for?
[147:42.92]No, I already went this way.
[147:43.64]It's actually down here.
[147:46.39]Oh, okay.
[147:46.89]Well, I just accidentally figured out how to get this item.
[147:49.81]Cool.
[147:56.15]What was it?
[147:56.45]It was down... All the way down here?
[148:00.57]Yeah.
[148:08.06]Don't poison me.
[148:11.45]My butt itches.
[148:12.99]Don't die again!
[148:13.65]Don't die again, please!
[148:16.11]Please!
[148:18.21]It's too dark over there.
[148:21.51]I'm sorry for the freakouts, guys.
[148:23.35]I really don't want to lose those.
[148:25.59]Alright, I remember this guy.
[148:41.40]Good job, you dumbass.
[148:42.82]What an idiot enemy.
[148:44.09]What a moron.
[148:46.09]He just looked at me the whole time.
[148:58.23]Do it again.
[148:58.69]Go on.
[149:05.89]Oh, god!
[149:07.75]Okay, slow down.
[149:08.89]Drink it.
[149:11.14]This is the guy.
[149:11.68]There he is.
[149:12.26]Okay, I'm going to try to parry him.
[149:15.28]I'm just kidding.
[149:17.60]Oh, fuck.
[149:18.02]He is actually kind of hard.
[149:19.58]No, he's not hard.
[149:21.52]Stop saying that.
[149:22.22]He's easy.
[149:23.27]Two.
[149:24.43]He does two swings.
[149:25.99]Get over it.
[149:27.25]One.
[149:28.15]Two.
[149:30.11]One.
[149:30.93]Two.
[149:32.15]Get over it.
[149:32.93]He's not dead.
[149:33.41]I thought he was dead.
[149:36.25]Why do you take so long to die?
[149:40.72]I can't believe he's still alive.
[149:43.90]Jeez.
[149:47.62]Oh my god.
[149:51.99]What happened?
[149:52.75]What happened?
[149:53.93]I'm not going to move until I figure out what happened.
[149:55.27]Okay, there's a plate on the ground.
[150:05.96]Another skip of some sorts.
[150:11.80]Does this lead all the way back to the bandit?
[150:13.74]Yeah, it does.
[150:16.96]Stone merchant.
[150:17.78]None of these guys.
[150:21.64]Time to fight another person in the dark.
[150:22.91]I don't have a fire weapon on.
[150:25.47]Shouldn't I be glowing?
[150:32.19]Oh, great.
[150:33.27]Oh, great.
[150:34.17]This is a good time to fight somebody.
[150:35.89]Where is he?
[150:44.08]I have to fight him like this.
[150:58.99]Go back.
[151:00.73]Go back that way.
[151:02.35]Oh, shit.
[151:03.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[151:04.35]Where's the light?
[151:11.79]I'm so scared.
[151:13.93]It's scary.
[151:14.61]It's a scary game.
[151:18.93]There we go.
[151:21.75]Oh, no, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down.
[151:23.41]I can still, I can see him right here.
[151:31.91]Okay, he's dead.
[151:34.32]Warden's Branks?
[151:38.86]Sounds like the person made that name up.
[151:40.38]An iron torture mask.
[151:44.26]Class 2 heavy armor.
[151:45.42]Damn, that thing's crazy.
[151:48.00]We should do that.
[151:54.08]It's so dark down here.
[151:55.04]This is horrible.
[151:57.28]Ooh.
[151:59.08]I can wear like a dress and shit.
[152:00.34]Hold on.
[152:00.64]Let's see how that looks.
[152:04.72]Strike defense.
[152:08.65]Strike defense?
[152:11.25]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[152:15.10]Damn, this has crazy strike defense.
[152:21.28]Unfortunately, it's a zero in everything else, so I don't think I want to do that right now.
[152:25.74]That seems like a terrible idea.
[152:30.01]I want Jerma to get lost in the dark and wear a dress.
[152:32.31]Well, already doing it.
[152:46.32]light armor rogues mask is pretty good slash defense
[153:05.92]He's not that bad.
[153:06.70]Yeah, put that back on.
[153:18.53]I actually don't really mind having this dress on.
[153:22.18]Because it's got such absurd strike defense.
[153:26.36]What's the nearest thing?
[153:27.12]Yeah, the closest thing is class 2 heavy armor.
[153:32.90]I don't think I'm going to miss the potential...
[153:36.55]Like lightning defense.
[153:37.51]Who cares?
[153:37.87]Yeah, I'm going to keep the dress on.
[153:39.37]Dress is staying on.
[153:41.90]Dress is on, guys.
[153:47.88]Anything else over here that I didn't see?
[153:51.82]Before I die again.
[153:52.84]This is kind of not good.
[154:02.63]Although I can put this down now.
[154:06.99]Where did I end up?
[154:09.22]That is a good question.
[154:12.06]Back here, okay.
[154:14.96]I don't think I wanna be back here.
[154:23.63]Don't think I want to be back there.
[154:26.39]So we're not gonna go back there.
[154:29.17]No, we are not going to go back there.
[154:38.06]Come back to the red hull of cages.
[154:43.93]Now what is this going on on my body right now?
[154:47.81]Is this max health?
[154:48.71]Why is it so awful?
[154:49.53]I'm scared this is a boss area for some reason.
[155:01.52]Let me go down.
[155:02.14]Because I haven't explored all the way down here yet.
[155:06.12]I have one potion left.
[155:08.83]Kind of a cause for concern.
[155:16.70]Crushers!
[155:17.84]Can't wait.
[155:19.82]Can't wait.
[155:22.38]You're annoying.
[155:25.38]You're dead.
[155:39.46]Alright, place your bets.
[155:41.60]Do I die to the crushers?
[155:49.89]Vile charm.
[155:50.87]This is probably poison damage, right?
[155:55.99]That's poison damage to your attacks.
[155:57.49]I kind of like the fire.
[156:00.61]Does Jerba ever raid chat?
[156:02.04]All the time.
[156:05.98]As much as I can.
[156:11.12]Is this even possible?
[156:11.92]They're on such an odd pattern.
[156:12.88]It's going to have to be right now, right?
[156:19.11]Are you kidding me?
[156:19.75]I bumped my head on it.
[156:21.57]I hit my face on it.
[156:24.59]He can't shoot me through here, can he?
[156:25.69]Yeah, of course he can.
[156:26.77]Why wouldn't he be able to shoot through the fucking wall?
[156:32.76]I have no max health.
[156:39.33]Seriously, I'm gonna chill up here till I get some I just bumped my fucking head Getting to a point where I'm not confident right now Not that confident
[157:08.53]That scared the shit out of me.
[157:09.59]That was a ghost.
[157:17.44]Hey, Realm Rifter.
[157:28.94]Thanks for subbing.
[157:32.44]I almost died down there, too.
[157:34.00]That was a kind of scary thing.
[157:36.74]But I'm welcome.
[157:37.40]Thanks a lot.
[157:37.80]Appreciate it.
[157:40.85]You just put $5 into a pot.
[157:45.12]And it's a pot that I can reach into.
[157:46.54]So thank you very much.
[157:47.48]Appreciate it, man.
[157:51.94]What is going on with my max health?
[157:55.91]Is this the wounding effect that I keep hearing about?
[158:00.97]Can't really mess around down here.
[158:04.59]How is this going to work with multiple subscribers?
[158:07.05]It's just going to loop.
[158:08.73]And it's too long.
[158:11.34]It's way too long.
[158:12.16]And I've come to that realization as I've been streaming.
[158:19.29]Swing.
[158:22.45]Will you swing at me?
[158:33.33]take that long I didn't even know there was a door over here can I grab that or should I I wonder I don't know I don't know guys can I like can I jump and grab that ledge it does it looks barely out of reach it does
[158:58.19]You know what I mean?
[158:58.67]That looks just barely out of reach.
[159:00.02]And I feel like if I could maybe jump off that and over, I probably could do it.
[159:11.56]I believe you think so.
[159:13.25]It's too much salt to lose.
[159:15.83]62% chance.
[159:18.73]I don't think I can do it.
[159:21.59]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[159:23.11]I don't think I'm going to make it.
[159:37.40]Made it.
[159:45.56]Gotta be careful here.
[159:47.34]Keep the high ground.
[159:48.10]Look at all these... This is morbid as all hell.
[159:49.95]Look at all these dead bodies hanging.
[159:53.27]Scary shit.
[160:07.82]What?
[160:08.24]What's my weapon?
[160:08.80]What happened to my weapon?
[160:11.90]Huh?
[160:13.92]Oh.
[160:15.13]God.
[160:15.95]I tried to block it and I... That took me a second to realize what happened.
[160:25.34]It was just gone.
[160:37.56]Stone guide.
[160:38.16]I really want a hub here.
[160:49.81]I'm desperate for a hub.
[160:57.81]Son of a bitch.
[160:59.20]Another dumb jump.
[161:17.95]I was trying to be cute.
[161:19.27]I was going to do a wall jump off that, which is what you're supposed to do that, but... Can't be cute with this many souls.
[161:26.05]Whatever they are.
[161:31.51]God damn!
[161:35.05]There's no more time.
[161:35.89]There's no more time here.
[161:38.97]I need to find... Whatever it is I need to find, I have to find it now.
[161:49.86]shortcut to the right okay you got it nice okay thank god where is it a shortcut to is the question wait secret door making that noise what's doing that what's doing that you guys heard that right I don't know where I am I kind of I just forget I don't know let's just see what's in this door
[162:22.79]Don't do that to me.
[162:27.24]Holy God, it's a weapon.
[162:33.10]I've done a lot of goos, and I'm kind of starting to feel it.
[162:38.09]I'm starting to feel the goos.
[162:46.19]An unusually light and graceful sword.
[162:52.65]Dexterity scaling, class 2 sword.
[163:00.89]Well, it looks potentially cool.
[163:05.70]But I'm Mr. Big Axe, man.
[163:12.48]Well, actually, I could probably just ring a bell.
[163:17.06]It might be a waste, but it's a long ladder.
[163:22.14]I gotta get the second part of the skip.
[163:23.44]Thank God I didn't use the bone.
[163:26.58]I didn't use the bell.
[163:27.90]Because I was just about to say I could... Where the hell am I?
[163:31.30]Where is this?
[163:31.96]What is this?
[163:32.58]Where is this?
[163:33.78]Who is this?
[163:34.59]Who are you?
[163:36.49]You slayed the dragon and I wasn't even there to help.
[163:39.09]Sorry.
[163:40.63]I suppose I need a new quest then.
[163:41.77]Very well.
[163:42.65]Ziggurat.
[163:44.17]Should I head to the dungeon below the castle?
[163:49.57]So they're telling me there's two ways I can go, I guess.
[163:53.00]Cool.
[163:56.72]Okay.
[163:59.68]Well, thanks for the info.
[164:06.28]I think now it is safe to... Bell?
[164:12.47]I guess.
[164:16.55]Although, I mean, yeah, this is... Could have gone this way before.
[164:22.75]I'm going to take a peek.
[164:29.94]Just a peek.
[164:30.50]Just a little quick peek.
[164:34.72]Just a little sneak peek.
[164:39.57]I just want to look.
[164:42.53]Once we get a good look, we can turn around and go back.
[164:46.63]Or there might just be a sanctuary right here.
[164:51.18]Sometimes they gotta throw you a bone sometimes.
[164:54.64]Get the bell ready, because if somebody comes out here, I'm pressing triangle.
[164:59.83]If I see an enemy that runs at me, I'm just gonna do it.
[165:06.27]Juzo Udewa.
[165:10.25]What the hell was that?
[165:14.22]Juzo Udewa?
[165:25.99]What the hell?
[165:26.71]When did I pick this up?
[165:32.10]That thing's pretty good.
[165:34.72]Here it is.
[165:35.94]Juzu Bracelets of Masterfully Crafted.
[165:39.48]Yeah, put them on.
[165:41.70]Why not?
[165:42.50]Cool.
[165:56.59]No, I'm not doing that yet.
[165:57.41]What about up here?
[166:02.25]I'm ready to press the button.
[166:04.23]The button is going to get smashed.
[166:08.12]Dome.
[166:08.50]Okay, this is one of the areas the guy was talking about.
[166:10.22]I'm ready to grab this item.
[166:21.15]Chest.
[166:21.33]Chest.
[166:24.40]Beware that terrifying thing.
[166:25.82]Amazing chest ahead.
[166:27.30]There's a trap chest.
[166:28.82]Right?
[166:30.90]Why else would they be saying that?
[166:44.15]There's going to be an octopus inside of this thing?
[166:48.21]I thought it was going to be poison and I could dash away from it.
[166:54.84]Very infrequently is a trap chest.
[166:58.08]I knew it was a trap, but I thought it was gonna shoot a... I was ready to dodge.
[167:01.80]I didn't know it was gonna be a cutscene where an octopus grabbed me and ate me.
[167:10.31]Like, really?
[167:12.35]There was no dodging or getting away from it.
[167:14.19]It was just, hey, here's a cutscene where you get grabbed by an octopus.
[167:24.40]Like, you guys know what I'm talking about in any of these Souls games.
[167:26.80]Oh, like a little arrow shoots you.
[167:28.54]Oh, watch out, there's like poison gas comes out.
[167:32.73]What the f- what was that?
[167:36.07]Honestly, what the hell was that?
[167:42.65]Why would they warn you if you could avoid it?
[167:44.14]Well, one of them said, oh, great chest ahead, huh?
[167:46.34]I don't know, I figured it was just a- How am I supposed to- Come on.
[167:53.95]Give me like 10% slack.
[167:57.99]Holy shit.
[168:00.22]Holy god.
[168:01.78]Unbelievable that I didn't die.
[168:03.34]I would have just ended the stream.
[168:05.88]If I died right there, stream would have ended.
[168:09.36]Because I would have lost all those souls.
[168:13.50]I need to get back to... What is that item?
[168:18.18]Can I draw?
[168:23.23]I kind of want that.
[168:31.12]Oh, I gotta get back down this way.
[168:33.18]Yeah, over here.
[168:33.58]Is that person still throwing shit at me?
[168:45.54]I'm like, so, like, just red in the face right now that I just forget even where I'm even going.
[168:54.21]It's like over here, right?
[169:12.30]The guy almost body blocked me.
[169:17.76]This guy's not even trying to hurt me.
[169:18.90]He's just looking at me.
[169:22.88]I would like it if you would please just go down the right path.
[169:25.66]Just go, please don't walk up the stairs like you keep doing.
[169:30.38]If I, you know, it sounds like I wish I could speak another language.
[169:34.31]Because right there, I would just be speaking another language.
[169:38.03]I would be just saying whatever I was saying, like in French or something.
[169:42.21]In fact, I think this is the long way.
[169:43.29]Where's the skip that I got?
[169:44.67]I just don't remember where the hell the skip is.
[169:49.94]Like, where was the skip?
[169:51.56]I forget where it even was.
[169:55.45]Very messy.
[169:56.01]I have full health vials, essentially, here, so it's no big deal.
[170:09.75]Not a big deal.
[170:22.72]No, he did this.
[170:24.90]Don't want to do it again.
[170:36.62]Hello!
[170:39.13]Bye-bye.
[170:40.09]Oh, idiots.
[170:43.01]There are a couple of idiots.
[170:48.99]Or two more idiots.
[170:52.74]Look at that, another idiot.
[170:59.52]It's kind of risky what I just did right there, but it worked out.
[171:18.56]These guys hurt so much.
[171:22.07]to a point where I'm going to write a letter.
[171:23.65]I'm going to write an angry letter.
[171:30.82]I didn't go that way.
[171:31.48]I was down here.
[171:41.48]There's that red shard.
[171:52.06]What is this cure poisoning?
[171:56.64]I like the word quaff though.
[171:58.74]Oh, quaff it down.
[172:06.12]I always read the chat.
[172:07.22]I do!
[172:09.40]You got to give me a little bit of slack here though.
[172:11.51]This is a game where you have to really concentrate.
[172:14.51]And if my head is like over on the other monitor...
[172:19.30]You know, like, I'm gonna die.
[172:23.06]In fact, I have to wait a lot longer now.
[172:29.43]No, I'm gonna get hit.
[172:31.65]I have to wait so long now.
[172:40.17]Didn't even need to wait that long.
[172:48.37]Uh, right side of the, uh, right side of the coin here is I'm getting a lot of salt just by going through here again.
[172:56.76]So, not that big of a deal as long as I don't die.
[172:59.10]And we will be fine.
[173:02.47]I also haven't seen a boss in a while either.
[173:05.19]Assuming there's one soon.
[173:18.82]I'm going to try that again.
[173:19.68]Actually, I don't even need to try it again because I can drop down right here.
[173:26.90]Hello.
[173:29.77]Bag of salt.
[173:31.13]Endless fang.
[173:32.41]And something else.
[173:33.97]Another bag of salt.
[173:40.05]Anything else?
[173:43.16]I don't think so.
[173:50.20]Just gonna keep those guys stun-locked.
[173:52.68]That's the easiest way to deal with them now, it seems.
[173:57.88]Did you guys even know he came up again?
[173:59.97]I didn't.
[174:02.33]Why?
[174:03.09]Get out of here!
[174:03.75]Why are you fucking aliens?
[174:07.17]What's the point of the aliens spawning right there?
[174:09.11]They just come out of the ground.
[174:11.81]Like the cretins they are, and I'm not even going the right way.
[174:17.14]Those stupid aliens.
[174:19.99]God, I'm going to have an aneurysm.
[174:36.04]A vote for me is a vote which Jerma didn't get?
[174:38.06]Is that what he's saying?
[174:39.18]I mean, we're talking president of video games.
[174:47.72]Are we really talking President of Gaming?
[174:50.38]We all know where the record stands on that.
[175:02.79]We all know where the record stands.
[175:05.51]You guys all know where I stand on the issues.
[175:08.72]The important issues.
[175:09.80]Okay, so...
[175:16.09]What happened again?
[175:17.71]What happened?
[175:18.27]I forget.
[175:19.07]How did I die?
[175:19.91]What happened over here?
[175:22.12]Does anybody remember?
[175:23.58]I don't remember.
[175:24.02]I remember saying I was going to take it slow, and we were just going to take a peek, and then I... That's where my memory ends for this.
[175:39.14]Oh, the trap chest.
[175:39.88]Right.
[175:40.10]There we go.
[175:40.44]Okay.
[175:40.84]Right.
[175:41.22]So... Remind me not to do that again.
[175:54.81]Where are my souls?
[175:59.01]Uh... Hello, game?
[176:06.02]Where are they?
[176:16.40]They're not like inside the chest, are they?
[176:20.56]No!
[176:22.10]Can I bash the chest?
[176:25.28]What happens if I swing at it?
[176:26.14]Okay.
[176:28.52]I have to kill him.
[176:29.64]What does he do?
[176:30.38]Is he going to grab me and eat me?
[176:31.72]If he hits me one time, do I die?
[176:33.24]He's walking at me very menacingly.
[176:36.12]He's backing up.
[176:36.72]Hold on a second.
[176:37.50]Hey, come over here for just a second.
[176:38.98]I just want to touch you and eat you.
[176:41.86]Oh, God.
[176:42.20]I don't know what to do.
[176:44.20]I'm so conflicted as to what's about to happen here.
[176:48.97]Is he just going to follow me out the door?
[176:51.81]He really is.
[176:54.62]No, come over here.
[176:55.96]Come here.
[176:58.40]He is scary looking.
[177:01.08]Did it.
[177:02.96]Thanks for the 1,000 souls.
[177:06.25]He didn't have them.
[177:13.49]Where are my souls?
[177:17.57]What happened to my 24,000?
[177:22.91]Did somebody take them from up here or something?
[177:24.71]I don't understand.
[177:33.78]Where the fuck did they go?
[177:34.68]There's an idol.
[177:44.20]Is this the right idol?
[177:45.70]Where's the amber idol?
[177:54.78]I don't fucking know.
[177:55.68]I'm not happy right now.
[178:02.84]Somebody has to have them.
[178:04.48]This guy does.
[178:06.70]This angel archer from Diablo has them.
[178:10.12]Got him back.
[178:21.75]I was trying to cramp.
[178:24.03]I was trying to cramp.
[178:34.86]No.
[178:35.46]I was trying to be cute.
[178:45.76]I wanted to jump off the wall.
[178:48.68]I didn't think it was far enough.
[178:49.72]Drop to kill me and I'm all the way back here.
[178:52.01]I'm about to go on a rampage on these people here.
[178:55.33]I'm so fine.
[179:01.03]I'm done.
[179:01.57]Game over.
[179:02.69]I'm done.
[179:05.29]I'll do this again another time.
[179:06.43]I can't do it right now.
[179:12.64]No, it's not the way.
[179:13.44]It's bad attitude.
[179:14.36]I'm going again.
[179:15.44]Bad attitude.
[179:21.83]That's a bad attitude to have.
[179:24.55]I'm going to get my souls.
[179:29.55]Give me a second here, guys.
[179:30.89]Give me just a second to explain myself.
[179:33.09]I need to have an explanation period here.
[179:35.35]It's two seconds.
[179:36.13]I went back to get my souls.
[179:41.36]They weren't there.
[179:42.20]Killed the monster that was supposed to have them.
[179:43.94]Weren't there.
[179:44.40]You know what I'm saying?
[179:51.17]And I went on another adventure I wasn't supposed to go on.
[179:55.91]And that's what caused the problem there.
[179:58.41]That's it.
[179:59.25]Nothing more, nothing less.
[180:00.43]That was what the issue was.
[180:01.55]Like, for real.
[180:10.18]He's gonna follow me again.
[180:21.69]Hello, hello, hello.
[180:26.05]Sorry, because I'm going to do the journey again.
[180:27.33]I'm going to get another 10,000 souls.
[180:28.59]Okay.
[180:36.59]Man, and then I'm going to get the sanctuary.
[180:38.73]Oh, my lord.
[180:40.19]Just don't die here again.
[180:42.47]Don't do it.
[180:43.85]Oh, yes.
[180:47.24]I see the evil in your eyes.
[180:52.09]Mr. Mars, 19.
[180:53.05]I did hear that.
[180:55.07]Thanks a lot, man.
[180:56.59]Oh boy.
[180:58.45]Haskey!
[181:18.89]Welcome!
[181:21.65]What's going on?
[181:28.57]Thanks, you guys.
[181:29.23]Thanks, both of you.
[181:31.05]Seven.
[181:32.89]Oh, yes!
[181:39.90]The longest of... I'm gonna, like, change it.
[181:43.20]It's too long.
[181:45.06]It's fun for tonight, though.
[181:47.48]Yes!
[181:54.78]Something about his dick?
[181:55.99]What is it?
[181:56.57]Sad about his dick?
[181:57.49]Is that what I'm reading?
[182:07.21]I did sad.
[182:08.17]I did hear that.
[182:08.81]Thanks for something.
[182:11.86]Something about his penis.
[182:12.66]I don't know what it was.
[182:19.79]What an awful sub train.
[182:22.25]Like, sound effect that is.
[182:23.65]Because it goes on for too long.
[182:29.64]For the three of you, thank you.
[182:31.02]Back to back to back jacks.
[182:32.72]I appreciate it.
[182:33.78]You guys rock.
[182:34.94]Much love.
[182:42.79]I just spit again.
[182:45.43]Oh my goodness!
[182:46.31]Did you hear that?
[183:00.94]Hey, Omega Skull.
[183:03.84]Oh, God.
[183:05.40]Come on.
[183:10.84]Jack Exalaba.
[183:12.16]I'm going to lose the game.
[183:15.32]Oh, my goodness.
[183:16.44]Did you hear that?
[183:24.65]Lama, thank you.
[183:26.01]Oh, God.
[183:33.15]Spag bol-bol video.
[183:35.90]I can't even.
[183:36.84]He's talking over me.
[183:46.44]Spag ol video.
[183:48.58]With the sub.
[183:49.20]No!
[183:49.54]Oh, my goodness.
[183:58.60]The patriarchy 2014.
[183:59.51]I'm gonna die.
[184:03.67]Hold on.
[184:04.23]Hold on.
[184:12.29]I can't, I'm gonna pass out, hold on.
[184:14.89]I see the evil in your eyes.
[184:21.08]When you know, my competitor will destroy him.
[184:31.84]It's number 17.
[184:33.88]How am I alive?
[184:35.58]How am I still?
[184:36.42]Where am I?
[184:43.01]G-Kunk's next episode.
[184:46.37]I just gotta skip.
[184:47.13]I just gotta skip so long.
[184:48.93]Look at this drop.
[184:49.87]Diesel locked in.
[185:09.01]I have to stop moving.
[185:09.81]I don't know what I did here.
[185:21.33]but I'm just gonna stand here for a minute.
[185:24.89]Oh my god.
[185:29.97]Paul Waffle with the subscription.
[185:41.60]What if it's a Christmas miracle that I'm alive still?
[185:53.47]Peel... Peel... I don't even know who it was.
[186:06.62]Peel something.
[186:20.09]We tied Spoonster hi
[186:35.73]Thanks for subbing.
[186:37.77]I can't... I can't even... If I can't even play, there's no way... I can't... I haven't died.
[186:45.01]I have dropped like... I have dropped like thousands of feet, Spoonster.
[186:52.44]I've dropped like 5,000 fucking feet and I'm still alive.
[187:01.52]I don't even know what to say anymore.
[187:04.59]Why is this such a big drop?
[187:13.01]Thanks, Ruby.
[187:15.33]Oh, God.
[187:18.19]God, you guys.
[187:20.85]Arbitr... Arbitr... Arbitruderid.
[187:31.81]If that's correct.
[187:39.60]I don't even know where to go.
[187:42.80]It's not ups.
[187:47.12]I definitely don't want to be going down this far.
[187:51.07]I need to go get my souls back.
[187:53.61]It's this way.
[187:54.23]It was an alien.
[187:59.97]Thanks for stopping.
[188:07.18]Okay.
[188:10.50]Thanks, everybody that just subscribed.
[188:12.32]Thank you so much.
[188:13.66]Awesome.
[188:14.42]Really appreciate it.
[188:16.86]I may have almost passed out during that, but twitchy dove, twitchy dove.
[188:21.55]I just want to get my souls back.
[188:27.03]Which way is this way?
[188:29.94]will destroy him at SummerSlam!
[188:32.29]Oh, my goodness!
[188:33.75]Did you hear that?
[188:38.17]The scream gets me every time when Paul Bearer screams into the microphone.
[188:43.99]Oh, God.
[188:44.69]I see the evil in your eyes.
[189:00.79]Tall Lucario.
[189:04.81]Okay, let me go to the sanctuary for a second.
[189:09.50]Take a breather.
[189:10.14]There's a sanctuary over here, right?
[189:16.70]Do I have the icon for this?
[189:22.34]I'm, like, gonna die.
[189:25.86]Oh, thank you so much, everybody.
[189:30.12]We don't have to do it.
[189:31.62]We don't have to do it anymore.
[189:34.08]It's okay.
[189:35.08]I love you all.
[189:36.20]You don't have to give something.
[189:46.06]I did hear it.
[189:47.34]Mighty Matador, thanks a lot.
[189:50.74]Okay.
[189:52.10]We're getting in and we're getting out.
[189:55.17]No cutesy nonsense.
[189:56.99]I'm going to ring the bell to make sure I don't do anything cute in here.
[190:02.61]And then we're going to go to the sanctuary that's right over here.
[190:07.35]It's the fact that he keeps screaming.
[190:10.63]And Vince McMahon keeps asking if we heard it.
[190:14.12]It's not that way.
[190:20.52]Dr. Cheese.
[190:30.09]Dr. Cheese, thanks a lot, man.
[190:33.10]Oh my goodness gracious.
[190:40.28]Lord Diabetes.
[190:44.64]Is that a control?
[190:45.60]I've lost control.
[190:50.59]There are these holes.
[191:00.77]Where's the sanctuary?
[191:03.45]Apphos.
[191:05.59]And somebody else, too.
[191:07.88]What is attacking me?
[191:10.42]What is attacking me?
[191:12.32]An invisible monster.
[191:13.62]There's invisible monsters now, Apphos.
[191:18.32]Am I saying your name right?
[191:22.48]What are these invisible fucking monsters?
[191:25.09]They're gonna ruin this.
[191:30.47]I see the evil in your eyes.
[191:34.37]It's too long.
[191:35.55]But you know.
[191:37.39]Say no.
[191:38.23]What are these fucking invisible creatures?
[191:41.99]What is true?
[191:43.23]Oh my goodness.
[191:46.78]Did you hear that?
[191:47.38]Say no.
[191:47.76]Say no.
[191:48.24]Your name had a say in it.
[191:50.14]Say something.
[191:52.54]Thanks.
[191:53.38]I see the evil in your eyes.
[191:56.00]This is crazy.
[191:57.64]This is crazy.
[191:58.58]But you know.
[192:11.65]This is insanity to me.
[192:16.57]Thank you all.
[192:17.99]Can somebody explain real quick before Paul Bearer fucking laughs and yells his name again?
[192:25.83]What does this mean?
[192:28.55]What does that mean?
[192:29.05]Like the cloud?
[192:30.41]Does that mean like eventually I can do something to that?
[192:40.21]Okay.
[192:42.53]I think the tornado went by us.
[192:44.90]I'm pretty sure.
[192:45.66]We got passed by the hurricane.
[192:47.72]And I think I can play the game.
[192:53.64]And stream the game.
[192:56.50]Thank you for the sub train.
[192:57.52]That was... Remarkable.
[193:02.65]So, thank you all so much.
[193:07.53]Let's get on with the Salton Sanctuary.
[193:13.53]There was a part there where I was laughing so hard and trying to play, I fell, so I'm gonna have to go back and watch that again.
[193:23.63]That was hilarious that I didn't die.
[193:33.40]Where does this go?
[193:36.86]This is different.
[193:38.98]This is different.
[193:41.37]This is different.
[193:47.99]What is going on right now with my character?
[193:52.54]What is happening to my guy?
[194:03.02]Thank you for the resub.
[194:04.60]What's going on?
[194:06.78]Who just resubbed Falkanth?
[194:09.52]Five months.
[194:09.96]I'm back where I started again.
[194:20.83]I'm gonna have like a hundred thousand salt.
[194:47.67]I was listening to Orson Welles.
[194:49.45]I'm fucking done.
[194:51.07]I just, oh yeah.
[195:13.03]I gotta get out of here.
[195:14.81]I gotta get out of here.
[195:16.53]I just lost 50,000 souls.
[195:19.98]I just lost 50,000.
[195:20.60]They're gone.
[195:22.16]They're gone forever.
[195:23.16]They're gone forever.
[195:23.96]They're never coming back.
[195:24.66]There was a resub there too.
[195:34.59]My body is tingling right now.
[195:37.19]This is like equal parts.
[195:38.73]Like I've never felt like this before.
[195:39.91]This is new emotion that I'm feeling right now.
[195:42.23]It's fucking rage.
[195:43.61]It's rage.
[195:45.15]It's absolute rage.
[195:46.54]But like I'm still laughing at stuff.
[195:48.12]I'm still like I'm laughing at what was just happening.
[195:50.70]There's too many emotions.
[195:53.20]This is what like a serial killer feels like.
[195:54.86]His emotions are just too many of them.
[195:57.90]And he's trying to control them.
[196:03.61]I have equal parts angry and happy and sad right now.
[196:06.75]They're fighting internally in my body.
[196:14.08]This is... I'm too distracted.
[196:17.88]This is too much distractions.
[196:22.02]Oh, look, an item.
[196:24.60]Oh, cool.
[196:24.81]I didn't even know I could go up here.
[196:27.55]Hey, a new adventure, guys.
[196:32.15]There we have it, folks.
[196:33.07]There's the confession.
[196:37.00]There's the confession.
[196:39.46]You got it out of me.
[196:40.58]You finally made me crack.
[196:44.58]All the bodies, I'll tell you where they are.
[196:49.73]Remember when this stream wasn't just donations?
[197:01.04]Hey, well, I killed some bosses.
[197:02.30]I was just, like, trying hard and getting angry at things.
[197:07.55]Okay, well... At this point, I kind of just, like... I've, like... My body is drained of all fluid.
[197:17.25]I think I peed my pants, like, three times.
[197:21.74]There's shit on the floor.
[197:23.94]I mean, after that last thing, I think it's time to change games.
[197:27.74]Take a little different approach.
[197:32.71]I see the evil in your eyes.
[197:36.10]Fish can roll?
[197:37.22]But you know my Undertaker will destroy him at SummerSlam!
[197:45.45]Oh my goodness!
[197:47.37]Did you hear that?
[197:49.29]Thanks a lot, Fish.
[197:50.31]And I missed a resub too.
[197:51.59]I missed one or two.
[197:52.31]There was like two or three people that didn't get through.
[197:55.90]Oh, I'm gonna, like, burp.
[197:57.76]You guys hear this?
[198:00.00]My stomach is rumbling.
[198:02.93]I ate, like, almost a half... I almost ate a whole half a tube of Pringles earlier.
[198:09.67]So it's like... It's like bubbles going on down here.
[198:17.31]I'm gonna change gears.
[198:18.99]I need something that's gonna just relax me a little bit.
[198:22.21]Let's do a little bit of Stardew Valley.
[198:25.71]Uh, it's going to take me a second to change gears.
[198:31.03]Boy.
[198:34.25]In fact, I'm going to take just a 60 second break.
[198:38.63]After that, that's just insanity.
[198:41.79]So... Hello, everybody that's coming from Starstream.
[198:46.89]You're just in time.
[198:48.37]You just missed... Like, total insanity.
[198:52.47]Like, a mental breakdown.
[198:54.85]I had so many emotions going through my body at the same time.
[198:57.25]Just a million different emotions.
[198:58.55]I can't even tell you what they were.
[199:00.97]But people here, we've been enjoying playing this game.
[199:04.95]Okay, I'm going to take a break.
[199:06.39]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[199:09.67]Buh-bye.
[199:11.25]Buh-bye?
[199:11.63]What the fuck was that?
[199:12.46]Buh-bye?
[199:13.94]What on earth am I talking about?
[199:20.80]I'm taking a break.
[199:22.86]I'm going upstairs.
[199:23.90]Lean Waffle, thanks for subscribing.
[199:26.88]I'm gonna miss somebody, probably.
[199:28.33]Alright, I'll be back.
[199:36.81]I hope I don't miss anybody, but take care.
[199:40.20]I'll be back in like...
[201:43.08]I just came back Thanks Grimbald I'm back we're gonna change gears
[202:08.16]Like I said, I'm mentally not able to play this game right now.
[202:12.87]I'm gonna play some Stardew Valley.
[202:15.65]So... Let's do this.
[202:20.17]Destroy him.
[202:21.37]Yeah, destroy him at SummerSlam.
[202:27.89]Did you hear that?
[202:31.64]Jeez.
[202:34.30]I need to change this too.
[202:42.47]Changing gears.
[203:01.36]Who's a subscriber?
[203:03.04]Johnny Kravitz.
[203:04.40]Johnny Kravitz.
[203:13.57]I look at my spelling.
[203:14.47]Look at this.
[203:15.47]I didn't even mean to do that.
[203:19.39]I didn't even... Refresh and look what this is.
[203:21.61]I screwed that up completely.
[203:27.89]Who's that?
[203:28.85]Who just subscribed?
[203:29.51]I didn't even see it.
[203:31.95]It's happening too fast, too quick.
[203:33.68]I already saw it.
[203:34.88]It was Johnny.
[203:38.08]Okay.
[203:38.60]Stardew Valley was swapped this out.
[203:42.28]Okay.
[203:44.78]This is going to be interesting because I need to change this to be the other monitor.
[203:54.51]Give me a second.
[203:56.29]And it shouldn't take too long.
[203:59.43]You know.
[204:01.03]Give me another ten seconds or so.
[204:04.11]Five seconds.
[204:06.81]It's changing gears.
[204:07.89]I can hear my heater over there.
[204:20.37]We can go back to bed.
[204:21.05]We're going to be just chill.
[204:21.91]Don't have to worry about souls and falling down.
[204:25.63]Okay.
[204:32.08]Alright.
[204:32.50]Opening it up.
[204:35.90]Oh boy.
[204:37.80]Monitor's freaking... Oh no.
[204:39.34]Is my stream still going?
[204:41.64]It is.
[204:41.94]Okay.
[204:42.32]I thought the stream ended accidentally.
[204:44.33]Nope.
[204:44.51]We're good.
[204:49.07]Oh, it's because it's a direct line into the PS4.
[204:51.17]Okay.
[204:53.17]Makes sense now, doesn't it?
[204:58.11]Add a game capture.
[204:59.70]We want Stardew Valley.
[205:15.65]Here's the video, Kings Court with Paul Bear and Ted DiBiase.
[205:18.61]That is, that is correct.
[205:25.12]Stardew Valley.
[205:27.38]Okay.
[205:30.30]Okay.
[205:34.41]Well, that was, that was interesting.
[205:42.60]I need to get my shit together here.
[205:46.08]There we go.
[205:48.04]Welcome, everybody.
[205:48.82]I think Star just pushed a bunch of people over here, so.
[205:56.31]Let's go.
[205:58.55]I haven't played since the last time I streamed it, so we'll see where we are.
[206:10.92]Ugh.
[206:14.11]We're in year two in spring.
[206:16.87]This game is very good.
[206:18.15]Highly recommended.
[206:19.59]If you're a fan of these simulation types.
[206:24.44]Farming in general.
[206:30.96]Whoa, what's going on there?
[206:34.12]Why is shit falling?
[206:38.37]Come on.
[206:39.43]Come on, game.
[206:39.93]Give me a break.
[206:41.61]Okay.
[206:44.65]I can't use my controller right now because I had to plug in my PS4.
[206:49.84]Controller.
[206:51.42]So what the hell was I doing?
[206:53.68]I think I wanted to fish with the new bait.
[206:59.43]These two are ready.
[207:00.09]Are these ready too?
[207:05.79]They are.
[207:06.23]These garlics are ready.
[207:12.69]Fox of Fury!
[207:14.29]Yeah, there are quite a few subs, I think, that didn't get Paul Baird.
[207:19.48]If you're one of them, I'm sorry I didn't get to see your name.
[207:22.16]But I appreciate it, nonetheless.
[207:30.42]So we're really just doing this to kind of wind down.
[207:33.61]I want to get up early tomorrow.
[207:36.09]What am I doing?
[207:36.51]I don't need to do that.
[207:38.01]Just gotta get the nubs.
[207:41.85]I nearly forgot this monstrosity.
[207:43.65]What are you talking about?
[207:44.39]This is nice.
[207:46.82]Everything's perfect here.
[207:49.26]Got my basketball court.
[207:52.92]What was on the list?
[207:53.50]Fresh fruit.
[207:56.16]Purpose of the skull key.
[207:58.00]Get a squid.
[207:58.74]Actually, I have some things to sell to this dude.
[208:03.82]Garlic.
[208:08.17]Garlic.
[208:11.01]Kale.
[208:12.23]Garlic.
[208:15.27]Potato.
[208:16.75]Did I have potatoes over here before?
[208:20.94]Don't let him unwind.
[208:22.22]Did I miss a couple of nubs?
[208:26.26]Did I?
[208:26.44]I'm going to have to go check on that.
[208:40.51]Keep one.
[208:42.61]I missed a nub.
[208:43.41]Oh, I did.
[208:44.63]Wow.
[208:44.91]Thanks for catching those nubs, dude.
[208:52.98]What are you straw-polling here?
[209:00.55]Jermis changes subsound to Danny DeVito's Trash Man.
[209:07.61]You guys want the trash man?
[209:09.19]The trash man.
[209:19.20]That's not a bad idea.
[209:20.10]That's a pretty good idea.
[209:20.86]Yeah, alright, fine.
[209:28.06]Yeah, you gotta have to give the people what they want.
[209:32.61]The trash man will be a sub-sum.
[209:36.77]And it's gonna be right when he hits Cricket, right in the head.
[209:40.10]With the... With the can.
[209:48.58]Alright, let me go... Sell this bug meat.
[209:53.25]Come on, I'm eating garbage!
[209:54.65]Eat garbage!
[210:00.55]Didn't wanna fish with this.
[210:04.53]Ancient, ancient seeds.
[210:06.95]Get rid of these.
[210:07.45]I don't care about these.
[210:09.35]What am I doing?
[210:09.83]Get rid of it.
[210:10.41]Throw it away.
[210:15.85]I was holding on to one of these for some reason.
[210:17.85]I think it was part of a... part of a thing for the community center, if I remember correctly.
[210:26.60]But let's go fishing with the new bait.
[210:27.76]Because I have a new... I got a new pole, too.
[210:35.25]Question is, where is it?
[210:37.81]Where is my pole?
[210:40.45]Where's my pole?
[210:44.42]Having trouble identifying where my pole is.
[210:46.80]Oh, there's my pole.
[210:47.54]I'm going to go to the tackle shop, see if I can buy something better shit.
[211:01.79]Join the moon cult.
[211:04.64]Well, a shitload of people just joined.
[211:06.76]A lot of people just joined the moon cult.
[211:13.91]You gotta show your love for the trash man.
[211:21.49]I don't have any parsnips.
[211:30.42]Make a YouTube series around this game?
[211:33.50]I have like 30 plus hours on stream of this game.
[211:38.68]It's a very long, slow game.
[211:43.10]So I don't know if I'd want to make any YouTube videos on it or anything.
[211:46.39]Are they open right now?
[211:48.81]Good.
[211:51.41]Okay.
[211:52.97]Spinner.
[211:54.33]Shape makes it spin around in the water.
[211:55.77]Slightly increases the bite rate when fishing.
[211:58.89]Lead bobber.
[212:04.01]Treasure hunter, cork bobber.
[212:10.40]I guess I'll do spinner.
[212:17.14]Buy a couple of them.
[212:19.36]And then we will cast into the ocean.
[212:23.36]Just to check out the new bait.
[212:24.79]Because it's supposed to be good.
[212:26.23]And spinner.
[212:31.89]Alright, let's see if we can catch a good fish.
[212:36.06]Times 30 speed and make it a one hour video?
[212:41.92]That sounds a little ridiculous.
[212:48.46]I didn't get it.
[212:49.16]Shit.
[212:51.38]Sardine.
[212:52.26]That's gold.
[212:59.41]Why am I broke?
[213:00.13]I spent a lot of money.
[213:01.75]I bought a lot of crops.
[213:11.00]Maybe I should go to, uh... Down deep.
[213:13.52]Yeah, I'm gonna go deep.
[213:14.76]Just wanted to see if it was anything useful.
[213:16.29]Another gold.
[213:21.19]Shitty bait.
[213:21.71]Yeah, I'm gonna go down to that area.
[213:23.53]With, uh, all the... All the trash.
[213:28.01]For the trash man.
[213:38.38]Oh, shit.
[213:38.88]Did I get you, Cricket?
[213:41.44]My can must have had an edge.
[213:43.62]Oh, you got me.
[213:44.68]Oh, Frank, you got me.
[213:45.94]You got me, Frank.
[213:47.56]Oh, shit.
[213:47.98]Did I get you, Cricket?
[213:50.95]Duh.
[213:53.11]That show is unbelievable, by the way.
[214:00.79]There must have been an edge on that can.
[214:08.16]Yeah, next time I stream, it will be...
[214:19.39]Danny DeVito is a god among men.
[214:21.83]He really is.
[214:22.39]Alright, where was the, uh... Was it 100?
[214:36.65]Yes, it was.
[214:38.50]Alright.
[214:39.28]Moment of truth.
[214:39.84]I have a lot of good wild bait, and I have...
[214:45.15]Now, do I lose bait for that 12?
[214:46.57]I hope I don't.
[214:47.81]That'd be really stupid if I did.
[214:49.11]I'd be really annoyed and mad.
[214:56.42]You do.
[214:57.46]Damn it.
[214:59.90]Maybe this isn't even worth doing then.
[215:06.90]Yeah, I don't think this is worth doing here.
[215:10.98]Go one more.
[215:18.74]Come on, give me a fish.
[215:21.50]Don't make this a waste of my damn time.
[215:31.10]Last one, actually really the last one.
[215:36.64]After that one.
[215:42.67]Lava eels worth a thousand gold, damn.
[215:46.03]Okay, I'm not gonna waste any more.
[215:47.47]We'll get it down to five.
[215:56.41]That's Max.
[215:57.53]That's Max.
[216:02.23]Come on, one more time.
[216:03.67]No, go.
[216:04.27]Bye.
[216:10.99]You have a problem?
[216:12.65]I don't.
[216:16.08]It's been a while.
[216:16.56]I forgot I could even do this.
[216:22.64]Let's go.
[216:24.78]Get me on this bus.
[216:34.76]I need an intervention for my gambling.
[216:37.98]Well, those of you that were here when I did the super ultra gambling, we ended up winning profusely.
[216:50.27]No, give me that back.
[216:58.36]We won ourselves a free trip to wherever the hell we were going.
[217:04.88]Spring... I could plant these, but... Whatever, I'll just plant them here.
[217:13.45]Empty spots anyways.
[217:14.41]And I'll leave that for... Something else.
[217:20.16]I'm just gonna sell this other one.
[217:21.50]Goodbye.
[217:21.82]Okay.
[217:27.59]Hello, Game Freak.
[217:30.35]Oh, I want to put a... Speaking of trash, I want to put some trash in this thing.
[217:41.37]Throw it away.
[217:45.95]Hello, dog.
[217:46.67]A lot of materials, but I don't really... know what to do with them.
[218:01.16]What is this?
[218:01.54]Is this a mayonnaise machine?
[218:05.35]No.
[218:05.63]Uh, 77.
[218:05.87]I remember what I was going to do.
[218:08.43]I wanted to get a coop.
[218:09.77]God, I always miss these nubs.
[218:28.11]Thank God that you guys in chat are on serious NubWatch.
[218:31.65]Because I would miss them.
[218:34.45]Because I feel like I do them, but I don't.
[218:36.19]Thanks for being on NubWatch.
[218:39.11]It's very appreciated.
[218:46.83]So I want to go... I'm going to talk to Linus.
[218:54.22]I have a bat cave.
[218:56.51]If you were curious.
[218:57.51]Somebody was curious.
[218:59.37]It's a bat cave.
[219:04.63]Those look like diamonds.
[219:06.57]Hey, Patty.
[219:07.45]Or Haley.
[219:07.91]I just make fun of my shoes.
[219:10.91]Are you serious?
[219:12.95]Nice shoes, but are they made out of plastic?
[219:16.35]They probably are.
[219:16.99]You don't have to be so mean about it.
[219:20.65]I think it might be a back-to-bed situation here, guys.
[219:22.51]Yeah, it is.
[219:37.81]Gotta get on nub watch.
[219:43.56]Yeah, let's go to bed.
[219:45.44]Good night.
[219:48.00]It's 5 p.m., time for rest.
[219:55.97]What gave me that, really?
[219:57.79]Oh, it was the five gold garlics, of course.
[220:03.09]Of course.
[220:10.79]I'm nice and relaxed now.
[220:15.51]I was super wound up.
[220:20.65]Nub watch.
[220:21.69]What do we got for nubs?
[220:22.34]Nub watch.
[220:23.42]Make sure I get these all.
[220:24.60]Thank you.
[220:25.24]Thank you very much.
[220:33.62]I didn't get this nub, but it's okay.
[220:36.00]There's nothing on it.
[220:37.32]Ooh, that's no good.
[220:38.28]I need to put something on here.
[220:43.07]eventually Okay, now let me do this Stress test the trash man.
[221:00.82]It's gonna be real quick, so don't worry It's not gonna be 20 seconds like the Paul Bearer one is
[221:10.41]Paul Bearer.
[221:12.11]Seriously, Paul Bearer took over the stream for like 25 straight minutes.
[221:16.93]There's nothing I can do about it.
[221:20.13]He just took over the whole stream.
[221:23.40]I blame... I blame Paul Bearer and his antics in the WWE.
[221:30.48]When he was talking to Ted DiBiase, he had a big conversation with Ted DiBiase about The Undertaker.
[221:42.17]He caused me to lose 50,000 souls.
[221:44.19]It was Paul Bearer.
[221:46.75]It wasn't my fault.
[221:47.59]No, it was my own fault.
[221:54.59]For playing like a dippy.
[221:57.85]I don't have anything.
[221:58.57]I thought I had something.
[222:10.27]Damn antics.
[222:15.96]Speaking of trash man, we're kind of being a trash man right now.
[222:18.56]I wanted to see Linus.
[222:37.20]Give me a river fish.
[222:38.06]I'm going to use the last five here.
[222:43.63]Are you kidding me?
[222:45.41]Even with the good bait and the good bobber?
[222:47.29]I'm gonna put algae?
[222:49.83]That's... What the fuck?
[222:53.91]Stop this nonsense.
[222:56.13]Give me a fish.
[223:01.98]That's un-fucking-believable.
[223:04.90]Did I seriously just get five algae in a row?
[223:08.20]No, this is gonna be the big one.
[223:09.20]Come on.
[223:20.36]It's a little sunfish.
[223:26.01]It's because you're the trash man.
[223:29.99]Alright, like, I forgot what I was doing.
[223:32.13]There's not really much I can do at the moment right now.
[223:37.71]I mean, I have, like, all my crops.
[223:41.88]I can get a coop.
[223:44.54]But I have to wait for my crops to back to you, dude, so I can break these open.
[223:55.03]Frank versus Charlie for Germa Rumble.
[224:04.95]Sunfish.
[224:06.61]My pole is garbage.
[224:07.53]This is an iridium rod.
[224:09.21]This is like, isn't that the best rod you could buy?
[224:10.90]That's new.
[224:22.92]Bird shit.
[224:30.16]Actually, I think I can give those.
[224:34.96]No, where is it?
[224:37.48]Yeah.
[224:38.86]I will donate the jaguite.
[224:52.27]Yay!
[224:52.77]What do I get?
[224:53.35]Come on, give me something good.
[224:55.29]Give me something good.
[224:57.75]Another stupid piece of furniture.
[224:59.97]That I would rather burn in front of him.
[225:04.02]This thing is huge.
[225:05.26]This thing is gigantic.
[225:08.54]I don't want this in my house.
[225:12.42]Here.
[225:18.16]It's a giant bear statue.
[225:20.37]You deal with it.
[225:20.99]I don't want it anymore.
[225:30.17]She hated that.
[225:32.27]She really did not like that at all.
[225:43.70]That's a very odd specific question.
[225:45.06]Okay.
[225:45.18]You don't sell me
[226:03.09]50 for hay.
[226:03.57]I just want to know how much hay was worth.
[226:08.14]Animals.
[226:08.92]Okay, coop.
[226:10.24]That's priority.
[226:11.54]Next priority.
[226:12.10]Number one is coop.
[226:14.16]I gotta start utilizing the cart more often.
[226:21.44]Just going back to fucking bed.
[226:22.64]Hit the snooze.
[226:30.51]Could have bought some things for over here, in fact.
[226:32.47]I don't want to make this, like, encroach any more than it already is.
[226:36.37]See if I can help that out.
[226:37.43]Alright, back to bed.
[226:45.01]Good night.
[226:54.97]Jeremy, I need some advice.
[226:55.65]The toilet seat is always cold.
[226:57.09]Do you have any advice?
[226:57.80]Of course I do.
[226:58.48]Oh my god, thank you for asking.
[227:01.28]Now, what you want to do is you want to wear pants, sit on the toilet first.
[227:07.20]Sit on the toilet with pants on before you, you know, do the deed.
[227:12.21]Sit there for about 60 seconds and these are really all, these are like Wizard of Oz lollipops.
[227:20.87]No!
[227:21.49]What?
[227:22.13]What?
[227:23.20]I missed a nub?
[227:24.26]No, I didn't.
[227:25.56]I did not miss a nub.
[227:26.36]Why is this the only one that's not growing?
[227:33.92]I didn't even want to pick that up either.
[227:35.38]I wanted to water it.
[227:36.10]Because you want a flower next to one of these, right?
[227:47.09]Does it matter how close it is?
[227:48.23]Does it need to be a bloomed flower?
[227:58.36]I'm curious.
[227:59.44]I'm assuming it just has to be standing next to it, right?
[228:11.59]Let's see what it looks like.
[228:12.69]Blue Jazz.
[228:19.47]Well, I'm talking about for the honey.
[228:21.71]Doesn't being near the honey do something significant?
[228:35.14]So I can leave just this one.
[228:37.84]But these two, I wish I didn't pick that one.
[228:44.04]So I'm going to have to leave these two.
[228:48.80]This time we're going to go blink, blink, blink.
[229:02.04]Just, it's very odd.
[229:03.32]I don't want to like accidentally pick it up.
[229:07.47]I want this one.
[229:08.31]Okay.
[229:10.95]Blue jazz honey.
[229:15.17]Oh, boy.
[229:15.53]That's a lot of gold.
[229:17.95]Why is this one a different color?
[229:29.25]Okay, that's cool.
[229:33.67]I want to keep making blue jazz.
[229:35.08]What am I going to sell these for?
[229:43.31]I don't know.
[229:43.61]We're going to have to go find out in town.
[229:52.14]What's the perfect hot dog?
[229:57.31]I would say just mustard only.
[230:00.83]Mustard only.
[230:01.89]That's the best hot dog in my opinion.
[230:04.15]And not a ton of mustard.
[230:05.11]Not a gross amount of mustard.
[230:07.19]One line.
[230:08.29]A small line.
[230:09.09]A thin line.
[230:12.85]People load their hot dogs up with all kinds of stuff, but I think the beauty of the hot dog is you get a good dog, small line of mustard, no ketchup.
[230:23.35]Get that ketchup away from me.
[230:24.69]You know what I'm saying?
[230:26.44]Yuck.
[230:29.54]Share my good fortune with you.
[230:32.20]Fried calamari.
[230:35.20]Huh.
[230:35.82]Well, thanks a lot, Linus.
[230:41.73]Okay, nub watch.
[230:42.67]Are we good?
[230:43.03]I think we're good.
[230:44.69]Maybe we'll get some more stuff.
[230:53.89]Ketchup is superior to mustard?
[230:56.13]I actually don't have an opinion.
[230:59.53]Mustards really only go to a few things, in my opinion.
[231:02.99]Pastrami, hot dogs, and the hot Chinese mustard.
[231:09.97]is good on like various things but it's not very good on I don't like it on the whole lot of things uh just whatever he's not silver very much he's actually it's two four let's see this is gonna suck
[231:42.25]Just get parsnips.
[231:43.53]I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[231:47.17]And then I might as well get jazz seeds because I already have them there.
[231:54.05]Or, you know, I could do tulips too.
[231:58.25]Six days.
[231:58.95]What was today?
[231:59.43]The 11th.
[232:00.81]I could do tulips inside of the jazz.
[232:05.85]I forget what's already over there, though.
[232:07.80]Whatever, just do what's already over there.
[232:09.38]Who cares?
[232:09.82]I need... I'll just get 15.
[232:14.22]I think I need like 10 or 12.
[232:20.42]Five gold parsnips for the community bundle.
[232:22.24]Well, let's try to get them.
[232:24.38]Get some quality fertilizer.
[232:37.42]Because I have to patch it up, and I'm going to keep some anyways.
[232:43.98]Anything else that I can do over here that I didn't do?
[232:48.43]I could give this back to Linus.
[232:50.97]He's a dummy, right?
[232:51.71]He'll just think I made it for him.
[232:53.57]That's what I'm going to do.
[233:06.89]Let me show you.
[233:08.25]Don't I have, like... Let's see.
[233:13.01]Parsnip, green bean, cauliflower, potato.
[233:15.37]Okay, that's why I was saving the potato.
[233:18.25]Oh, shit.
[233:18.63]Well, I'm already here.
[233:22.54]Don't throw it on the ground.
[233:23.28]One of these little shitty gumdrop guys might eat it.
[233:30.58]Tiger trout, catfish.
[233:33.34]Oh, I have that.
[233:42.88]I want this so bad.
[233:43.85]25,000 gold.
[233:47.05]I could have done it too.
[233:49.45]I could have done it.
[233:56.37]Mushroom is the only one I need.
[234:02.84]Duck feather.
[234:08.18]Maple syrup.
[234:11.72]I have hay.
[234:15.92]Can't really do these.
[234:20.46]Stop watering everything.
[234:21.40]It's just I'm used to left-clicking and right-clicking to activate things.
[234:24.77]It's just... You know.
[234:28.15]You know.
[234:32.51]I don't think I'm going to have enough for a bean.
[234:35.35]Yeah, whatever.
[234:38.21]Oh, well.
[234:39.69]Wait, was there anything else there?
[234:44.37]Honey...
[234:47.38]Uh, I'll just take one.
[234:49.28]Put it there.
[234:54.06]Oh, an apricot!
[234:58.57]I need five gold parsnips.
[235:01.85]Keep that in mind.
[235:02.87]Go on.
[235:08.39]Summer artisan.
[235:10.14]Okay.
[235:20.72]I already have one of these.
[235:21.60]This is what I have.
[235:22.56]One of these.
[235:25.76]Leek and Dandelion.
[235:29.96]Cool.
[235:32.90]Still don't have any of these.
[235:36.26]Oh, well.
[235:38.78]Please explain what I'm doing.
[235:39.80]This is the community center.
[235:42.18]And in the community center, you are tasked with bringing various items throughout the game.
[235:47.65]For instance, the Crab Pot Bundle.
[235:50.84]I have to collect these, put them in the Crab Pot Bundle, and voila, vinny-vitty-vitchy, they give you a bonus.
[236:00.00]And it unlocks another thing in here.
[236:01.28]It's really just making sure you hold on to things and be organized, which I'm not at all, so I'll never finish, like, any of that shit in there.
[236:15.71]An eel?
[236:16.73]No thanks.
[236:19.34]Alright, where's the chicken lady?
[236:25.31]Where's the chicken lady?
[236:32.59]Anybody know?
[236:33.82]Anybody know who the chicken lady is?
[236:35.58]There she is.
[236:39.92]What's going on with the swears?
[236:40.90]Everyone's like swearing in this chat.
[236:42.54]What's with you swear guys?
[236:47.71]We're just swearing?
[236:49.09]We're just saying swears?
[236:51.70]Come on.
[236:57.68]Okay, how much is any 300 wood and 100 stone?
[237:04.04]Sounds easy enough.
[237:08.96]We'll get a coop.
[237:10.30]I'm gonna just need to chop down some trees and get some stone.
[237:12.78]Actually, you know what?
[237:13.70]Who cares?
[237:16.38]I'm not cutting shit down.
[237:18.12]Buy it.
[237:29.50]Ah, shit.
[237:31.78]Oh, damn it.
[237:33.18]I don't have 4,000 gold anymore.
[237:35.56]Whoops.
[237:39.05]Got you, though, guys.
[237:40.07]I got you.
[237:40.67]Because I do have that much money.
[237:42.27]Because I just sold a bunch of stuff, and now I don't have to cut down as many trees.
[237:45.07]I can just do it tomorrow.
[237:45.77]Back to bed.
[237:57.85]reset.
[237:58.25]No, it was intentional.
[238:07.61]Whoops, lost all my money.
[238:08.59]I didn't lose all my money.
[238:09.75]It's all there.
[238:11.85]You can count it.
[238:18.53]Yeah, I'm going to make honey mustard.
[238:20.69]I'm going to have like 500 jars of honey mustard.
[238:22.42]You'll see.
[238:25.04]Nubwatch, we good?
[238:26.14]I think we're good.
[238:30.93]Yeah, watch this.
[238:32.27]I'm gonna sell seven jars of this nub honey.
[238:35.75]People are gonna be clamoring to get it.
[238:48.16]Enter seeds... Where's the wood?
[238:58.62]I'm over... Okay.
[239:00.44]I may have purchased way more than I needed.
[239:05.08]That's okay because we're going back to bed.
[239:09.60]Everything's better when you go back to bed.
[239:13.43]Let's see how much that nub honey sells for.
[239:18.25]Hmm.
[239:18.79]Hmm.
[239:25.25]Hmm.
[239:30.58]My dog is opening the door.
[239:36.88]Okay, let me... Okay.
[239:49.93]Tomorrow we're holding the egg festival in town.
[239:52.11]I'm going to win this time.
[239:53.03]You should arrive between 9 a.m.
[239:54.11]and... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[239:55.09]9 a.m.
[239:55.39]You got it.
[239:55.77]Let's build a chicken coop.
[239:58.85]Make sure I have it in my inventory.
[239:59.98]I do.
[240:03.32]I'm gonna take the mine cart this time.
[240:08.55]Is that a bus stop?
[240:09.41]Yeah.
[240:13.49]Fairy rose honey is 680 gold per jar.
[240:15.67]Damn.
[240:17.88]It's kind of insane.
[240:27.44]It's just a little insane.
[240:41.54]Get out of my way, trees.
[240:42.42]I wish I could just cut you down.
[240:45.30]You're not going to be open.
[240:51.85]No, wait a second.
[240:52.63]Wait a second.
[240:53.09]Wait a second.
[240:53.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[240:57.73]Wait a second.
[241:04.01]Where is it?
[241:05.98]Where did it go?
[241:09.49]I just yawned.
[241:10.29]You know what that means.
[241:10.91]Oh, bugs flying in my nose.
[241:21.22]I got it.
[241:21.58]Don't worry.
[241:22.30]I got it.
[241:26.38]I saw at least two people freaking out about that.
[241:40.00]Shh, nobody tell him.
[241:43.14]Come on, I'm just burning time.
[241:44.41]I want to build a chicken coop and then get the eggs.
[241:47.51]After I get the eggs, after I... Well, hold on a second.
[241:50.65]Excuse me.
[241:51.95]After I win the egg picking competition, I'm probably going to hit the hay.
[241:58.78]Because I've been on a pretty normal schedule and I want to get a video uploaded tomorrow.
[242:07.58]And I have to find the perfect trash man sound.
[242:11.09]So the trash man can take over my stream.
[242:17.91]Okay.
[242:19.41]Let's do it.
[242:21.60]Build it.
[242:29.68]How's about... I don't know.
[242:34.81]Like right here?
[242:35.49]Right here?
[242:38.95]Let's go right here.
[242:42.67]Scylla can be in the back.
[242:43.55]Dog can go look at the chickens.
[242:47.07]Thanks a lot.
[242:48.49]Wait, did you say she's not going to work on it because of the egg festival?
[242:52.45]Smash her stuff.
[242:54.25]Take her ice cream, too.
[242:55.07]Give me that ice cream cone.
[242:56.49]Vanilla.
[242:57.05]It's my favorite.
[243:02.97]Well.
[243:04.66]Let's deposit this.
[243:08.24]Where is it?
[243:11.00]Spring foraging bundle.
[243:19.67]There it is.
[243:20.77]Dandelion.
[243:22.13]I need to find a dandelion so I can just complete this.
[243:31.98]Looking for a dandelion.
[243:41.58]What's the quickest place to find a dandelion?
[243:46.35]I'm thinking beach.
[243:48.97]Playground slide?
[243:58.39]That wasn't a lamp, that was an ice cream cone.
[244:00.05]That was a vanilla and a standard cone.
[244:11.74]Trash man, there it is.
[244:13.30]Wait, he doesn't care.
[244:15.64]Does this guy not care?
[244:17.51]Let's make sure he's in complete plain sight.
[244:21.49]Oh, he does.
[244:21.95]He didn't care before.
[244:23.35]It was a lamp.
[244:31.72]It wasn't a lamp.
[244:34.09]It was an ice cream cone.
[244:46.60]No, that's not a dandelion.
[244:52.60]What are you doing on that?
[244:54.04]Sam's trying to do a kickflip.
[244:55.30]Let's see it.
[244:57.51]That's not a kickflip.
[244:59.29]You just went goofy.
[245:03.49]Can you do something else besides go goofy?
[245:06.17]That'd be great.
[245:08.19]I know the lingo, guys.
[245:09.47]I played Tony Hawk.
[245:20.14]The search for one dandelion.
[245:21.64]That's all I care about.
[245:26.58]Come on.
[245:29.66]There's got to be one here somewhere.
[245:36.52]All the way down.
[245:39.44]Wait, I passed it?
[245:40.44]I passed it?
[245:41.12]What do you mean?
[245:41.74]Was I too busy talking about skateboarding?
[245:46.66]What?
[245:48.58]What?
[245:52.97]Where?
[245:56.47]Where is this fucking thing?
[245:57.27]What are you talking about?
[245:57.95]Oh, there it is!
[246:12.12]I was looking over here.
[246:18.97]I was too busy focused on my front peripheral.
[246:23.12]I'm going to go to the community center and put these in.
[246:26.42]I'm tired.
[246:26.92]Look, everybody... Hold on a second.
[246:28.88]Let me come up with a couple of excuses.
[246:30.80]Five excuses.
[246:31.98]Guys, I'm tired.
[246:34.40]I spent half a stream and it's like I'm reading chat and stuff like that.
[246:38.16]I hope they like those excuses.
[246:39.70]I hope they understand them.
[246:49.05]Twitch plays Stardew Valley.
[246:50.35]That'd be interesting, actually.
[247:02.00]Changing gears.
[247:02.74]Alright, where is it?
[247:05.32]Right here.
[247:06.84]Crops bundle.
[247:08.83]Foraging bundle.
[247:11.47]Where's the forage?
[247:13.75]Somewhere.
[247:14.07]I don't know.
[247:17.59]I'm seeing a lot of failfishes in the chat.
[247:20.68]You're going to failfish this?
[247:22.06]You're going to failfish this one?
[247:24.54]Leak.
[247:26.10]Dandelion.
[247:26.80]Golden.
[247:28.00]Bundle complete.
[247:34.18]Ooh, wild spring seeds.
[247:38.71]It's absolutely maddening.
[247:40.93]Okay, for the rest of the stream, I'm going to talk like this.
[247:49.72]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[247:50.98]Oh, stop doing that.
[247:56.20]Stop doing the fail fishes.
[247:57.42]It's really making me mad.
[248:02.29]Should I just plant these and who cares?
[248:03.83]Yeah, I'm gonna plant them.
[248:08.54]And then we're doing the... Even if they don't make it.
[248:11.28]They got like 17, 18 days.
[248:13.56]I didn't want to have to do this.
[248:25.75]Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[248:29.36]Didn't want to have to do it, but you made me.
[248:33.94]Can anybody in the chat do that?
[248:44.52]I could probably go even higher than that, too.
[248:47.48]That was a preliminary doy.
[248:58.09]Why?
[248:58.55]Parsons are really fast.
[249:08.20]Okay, you take your hand.
[249:09.50]We're going to go over it.
[249:13.40]You take your hand and you... I might turn on my webcam for this because this is really important.
[249:22.31]This is actually pretty important.
[249:24.03]You know what I mean?
[249:30.97]Just give me a second.
[249:32.50]This is important to me.
[249:40.51]Let me just get my webcam on.
[249:58.26]Okay.
[250:00.62]Don't mind my hair.
[250:01.68]It's a mess.
[250:02.48]Don't mind me.
[250:12.34]I'm going to look like shit right now, so just be aware of that.
[250:19.28]Be aware.
[250:19.78]I wasn't going to make fun of my hair.
[250:43.62]Okay.
[250:43.86]So this should pop up in a second or so.
[250:49.23]I hope so.
[250:50.17]Where is it?
[250:52.01]There it is.
[250:52.47]Okay.
[250:55.00]hi okay so what you want to do it's very simple you want to take your hand like this you make it you make like a like a little hole like that put up to your mouth and you want to say you want to say girl it's very important you want to say girl you don't want to say like you want to go girl pretty cool huh
[251:18.46]Now you're just making me fucking angry.
[251:20.48]Now you're just making me angry.
[251:22.30]Stop with the fail fishes, goddammit.
[251:24.26]It's really pissing me off.
[251:33.27]Let's play.
[251:59.47]Where's my controller?
[252:00.15]There it is.
[252:03.25]Oh, there was a delay?
[252:04.13]Oh, shit.
[252:04.93]There was a fucking delay.
[252:06.11]Oh, that's too bad.
[252:15.18]Second out of sync.
[252:16.48]I didn't realize that.
[252:17.16]So this must be like a second out of sync, too.
[252:21.18]Hold on.
[252:21.72]I gotta see something here.
[252:23.08]This is important.
[252:35.57]Oh, shit, my, like, PlayStation is going to turn on here.
[252:37.55]All right, watch this.
[252:44.29]I think that was cool.
[252:47.05]Am I still out of sync?
[252:48.07]Am I still, like, out of sync?
[252:49.39]I hope not.
[252:55.10]Shouldn't be at this point.
[252:56.58]I think I fixed it.
[252:59.08]Want to see something cool?
[253:05.40]It's better?
[253:07.78]Okay.
[253:10.12]That's good.
[253:16.43]Look at how stupid this is.
[253:19.45]Oh, what a beautiful sunset.
[253:21.59]I thought you just loved when it's like the sun is shining right in your face.
[253:23.99]You know, let's go in like deep sea.
[253:26.78]We're underwater now.
[253:28.14]It's like, it's wonderful down here.
[253:32.74]You guys like to ski?
[253:34.59]Because it's nice and blue.
[253:38.56]What else do I got?
[253:39.10]What are the jokes I get besides the angry one?
[253:44.08]Take a look.
[253:45.86]Got new lights.
[253:51.40]I got you that first time, though, didn't I?
[253:59.54]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[254:01.90]The lights?
[254:02.60]Nothing.
[254:03.80]They're fun.
[254:15.32]Give us a tour?
[254:15.98]No.
[254:16.04]I don't need to do that.
[254:34.96]Where is he?
[254:35.38]Pierre, where the hell are you?
[254:48.17]Where is he?
[254:50.73]Is it the egg festival already?
[254:51.89]7 o'clock.
[254:54.71]It doesn't close.
[254:55.73]It closes at like 10.
[255:03.84]Oh, shit.
[255:05.28]Hey, look.
[255:09.50]There it is.
[255:19.87]Thanks, Apollo.
[255:24.67]Thank you for subscribing.
[255:26.09]Welcome.
[255:28.34]Alright, it's time to win some eggs and then I'm going to bed.
[255:38.40]Phil Fisher's in his bedtime.
[255:44.41]Did I just say fail fishes then it's bedtime?
[255:46.57]I didn't even pick these.
[255:50.40]Fail fishes then it's bedtime.
[255:53.74]That sounds like a plan.
[256:12.55]Fuck, I didn't mean to... That's alright, I don't care.
[256:14.07]I don't care.
[256:21.23]Turn your body.
[256:22.49]I'm just gonna pick him up now.
[256:24.29]Because I want to put tulips there instead.
[256:26.19]I feel like tulips might be cool.
[256:31.32]Get tulip, honey.
[256:32.86]Ah, the French champagne.
[256:36.59]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[256:39.27]StreamerFreedom63, thanks for resubbing.
[256:42.59]Welcome back.
[256:43.17]Egg Festival's at 9.
[256:48.29]I feel like I might need these for like a flower bundle or something at some point, so I'm going to hold on to one.
[257:07.58]I will hold on to one of these.
[257:11.09]None of those parsnips were gold.
[257:15.87]That's unfortunate.
[257:20.15]Where are they?
[257:31.64]Whatever.
[257:32.34]Let's put them over here.
[257:37.01]And it's gonna go one on each corner, this nub.
[257:41.82]And the spring seeds are just gonna go in.
[257:49.57]I don't even care about fertilizer for these pieces of crap.
[258:10.36]What's the camera?
[258:11.50]What's everybody doing the camera for?
[258:20.25]Oh no, I'm not turning my camera back on.
[258:26.31]For like a five hour stream, you only get to watch me act like an asshole on camera for like two minutes.
[258:30.34]That's the rule.
[258:41.25]Let's win the egg festival.
[258:50.92]Oh, I was expecting like a cutscene for a second.
[258:56.80]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[259:03.89]There's the whale.
[259:05.05]Chianti whale with a resub.
[259:07.63]Thanks a lot.
[259:09.15]You're about to watch me
[259:12.14]Are we really spamming the camera thing?
[259:15.70]Okay, you'll watch me win the egg festival.
[259:18.40]And then I'll say goodbye on camera.
[259:20.48]How does that sound?
[259:21.06]I don't really care about anything else here.
[259:23.62]I just want to win the egg festival.
[259:30.93]I didn't win last year.
[259:31.71]I'm going to try to win this year.
[259:38.72]I hope I'm like a grown man against children in an egg contest.
[259:42.78]It seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it?
[259:47.18]Let the egg hunt begin go.
[259:47.98]Come on, where are the eggs?
[260:03.22]Two... I had like six or seven last year.
[260:05.12]Get out of my way, you little shit!
[260:16.91]Can't even go up there.
[260:18.01]Don't even tell me she can get up there.
[260:19.13]Nope.
[260:19.49]She's an idiot.
[260:19.92]She's just blocked.
[260:32.99]Come on.
[260:33.53]Am I not going to do it?
[260:40.01]Seven eggs.
[260:40.55]I got exactly seven eggs last year, too.
[260:42.32]I'm not going to win.
[260:56.51]Yeah, yeah, the winner is Abigail.
[260:58.59]She did such a good job.
[260:59.65]Yeah, I knew it was going to be her.
[261:09.33]I'm trying to hit escape.
[261:10.17]I'm actually trying to exit the game.
[261:19.08]Should have checked the trash.
[261:23.90]I'm exiting the game.
[261:24.92]I'm not losing.
[261:26.71]No, I don't care.
[261:28.65]Alright, that's going to wrap it up, guys.
[261:30.71]I'm pretty tired.
[261:32.43]Beaten by children.
[261:33.53]Filthish.
[261:36.05]Alright, bye.
[261:39.34]Me and Otto can say our goodbyes and do it on camera.
[261:41.92]Why not?
[261:42.50]Fine.
[261:44.02]Everybody's spamming in the chat.
[261:45.38]Do it.
[261:46.86]Spam in the chat.
[261:51.13]Hi.
[261:52.41]See you later.
[261:53.33]Thanks for coming out.
[261:54.69]All the amount of subscriptions that happened today were kind of crazy, so... Thanks for subbing, everybody.
[262:01.37]It was fun.
[262:03.71]Extreme.
[262:05.46]Then that's it.
[262:06.56]So, I have Otto say goodbye, too.
[262:08.22]Except he's asleep down here with his Bonnie the Dinosaur toy.
[262:18.12]Otto!
[262:21.00]He loves this thing, man.
[262:22.15]He sleeps with this thing.
[262:23.05]It always has to be in bed with him.
[262:25.29]Or at least near him.
[262:30.09]But, whatever.
[262:32.40]Take it easy, guys.
[262:33.78]Always a pleasure, always fun.
[262:35.78]And goodbye.
[262:36.28]I'll see you probably tomorrow.
