[00:06.43]Hello!
[00:07.47]Traveler!
[00:07.89]Hello!
[00:09.07]Traveler!
[00:11.36]I got you!
[00:11.86]What the hell is your character?
[00:15.83]What's your name?
[00:17.72]What is your name?
[00:20.16]You look like Elmo.
[00:22.74]Don't do that.
[00:23.86]I'm gonna die now.
[00:24.56]Yeah, I'm gonna bleed to death now.
[00:26.40]Did you slice him?
[00:27.28]Yeah, he sliced me.
[00:28.04]I'm dead.
[00:29.18]I'm just looking at the screen right now.
[00:31.42]It's just 19, 18, 17, 16.
[00:32.40]Hold on, I can do something.
[00:34.06]Hold on, hold on.
[00:34.90]I have a... You better hurry up, whatever the hell you're gonna do.
[00:39.62]You...
[00:44.97]Oh, you're a zombie?
[00:45.75]Well, hello, zombie.
[00:46.83]I've got pocket knife.
[00:48.57]Alright.
[00:48.97]Let's also save all the looting and stuff for when we actually meet up.
[00:52.66]We just get, like, a melee weapon.
[00:53.96]I broke my leg, by the way.
[00:56.96]I climbed up this ladder to try to find, like, just, like, a weapon, and I slid down and broke my, like, femur.
[01:05.82]So I'm going to have, like, a hand saw.
[01:08.90]Good.
[01:09.20]There we go.
[01:12.31]I've got legitimately like 30 zombies on me.
[01:14.33]Yeah, there's so many.
[01:18.69]Get away from me!
[01:19.53]Back!
[01:22.20]Back, you vile spawn of Satan!
[01:24.54]These guys are gonna kill me.
[01:28.46]Why does the handsaw suck?
[01:31.50]Holy shit, this item is terrible!
[01:33.50]I'm dead.
[01:35.04]Well, you're trying to kill zombies with a saw.
[01:36.56]What do you expect?
[01:38.16]I think I'm at pizza again.
[01:42.46]Oh, there's a lot of zombies here.
[01:44.10]Yeah, just be careful.
[01:45.12]It's out.
[01:45.96]It's out.
[01:46.83]No gas.
[01:47.85]That one does not have any gas.
[01:49.43]I'm at pizza again.
[01:50.35]Alright.
[01:50.91]Well, you are currently getting swarmed.
[01:53.99]Yeah.
[01:54.63]No joke.
[01:58.00]Don't die.
[01:59.78]Make your way.
[02:00.54]I haven't got a hit yet.
[02:01.94]Oh, that's a fast one.
[02:03.30]That's a fast one.
[02:05.06]He's fast.
[02:05.90]Where's the katana man?
[02:07.90]You have to run to me.
[02:08.84]I'm running to you.
[02:09.90]Just kill the fast one behind me.
[02:11.70]Just backpedal.
[02:12.50]Backpedal while you do it.
[02:15.06]Okay.
[02:15.81]I don't think I want to do that.
[02:20.69]Oh, sledgehammer.
[02:22.39]Alright guys, we finally met up.
[02:25.17]Three friends.
[02:26.87]What do you guys want to do?
[02:28.89]What the hell?
[02:30.39]Is that a door?
[02:31.87]The shield.
[02:33.09]Stay on your side.
[02:36.03]Your arms are just coming through.
[02:37.39]Hey!
[02:38.21]Dude, it took us seriously like an hour and 15 minutes to find each other.
[02:43.11]Do not just start like attacking.
[02:49.90]Are there no headlights on this car?
[02:52.49]There we go.
[02:55.15]Got it.
[02:56.15]Let's do it.
[02:56.49]If you turn around, you can see Jerma sitting in the back.
[02:58.71]That's funny.
[02:59.33]I'm going to sit in the back with him.
[03:01.01]He looks lonely.
[03:02.91]I have no idea where I'm going, by the way.
[03:05.43]Sit back here with me.
[03:07.11]Is there a military base?
[03:08.93]No, I did not mean to do that.
[03:10.63]I didn't mean to do that.
[03:11.99]Did you hit him?
[03:12.97]I'm not going to tell you what happened because I don't want this to turn bad, so no.
[03:16.45]I'm trying to do it.
[03:17.41]How do I hit you?
[03:18.85]You can't.
[03:20.27]Only I can, apparently.
[03:23.00]Alright, let's go.
[03:23.46]You can, like, shoot out of the windows.
[03:25.44]How?
[03:25.62]If you have guns.
[03:26.26]I don't know.
[03:27.70]Can I shoot him in the backseat?
[03:29.44]Don't even tell me.
[03:30.52]Seriously, don't.
[03:32.14]Don't even seriously.
[03:33.20]Hey!
[03:33.64]Oh, you killed me!
[03:38.10]What the hell is this?
[03:52.64]Why?
[03:53.18]I didn't think that was going to instantly kill you.
[03:58.70]I really did.
[03:59.32]I'm crying right now.
[04:01.74]I really didn't think that was going to instantly kill you.
[04:06.08]It instantly.
[04:08.32]Dude, I thought it was just going to be like when I hit him.
[04:12.02]It was just like, boop.
[04:15.20]A zombie.
[04:16.67]Oh, no.
[04:17.19]Whoa, whoa.
[04:19.63]Oh, no.
[04:21.89]What the hell, dude?
[04:23.49]He wasn't even in here.
[04:25.35]He's dead now.
[04:27.14]I almost died, too.
[04:28.72]I got snuck up on when I was looting.
[04:33.14]I took some vitamins.
[04:34.00]Did they give you health?
[04:37.72]No.
[04:41.84]Oh, I guess maybe they do.
[04:43.39]Hey, Jeremy, get out of that building real quick.
[04:45.83]That car's about to explode.
[04:47.81]What car?
[04:49.37]No, that car.
[04:51.35]You... What are you, like, grunting for?
[04:57.90]I was... There's so many zombies.
[05:00.78]I just saved the car.
[05:03.04]The zombie's gonna... You better get out of that car.
[05:06.46]I'm out.
[05:06.88]It's gonna blow you up.
[05:08.11]You're still too close, probably.
[05:12.48]Can you kill this guy with your... I only have 35%.
[05:17.91]There's bandages in here.
[05:19.13]There's vitamins in here.
[05:20.41]Alright, let's get them.
[05:22.05]They've trapped me!
[05:23.07]Jerma!
[05:24.34]No!
[05:25.28]I can't get in there.
[05:27.98]Don't worry, I got you.
[05:32.08]Jeez!
[05:32.92]Punch him!
[05:33.56]Punch him!
[05:34.76]Punch him!
[05:36.77]It's an island with a helicopter down there.
[05:38.65]Oh, you're in the island with the downed helicopter?
[05:41.13]That's what I've been saying!
[05:42.63]Wait, let me look through my binoculars.
[05:45.71]I see him!
[05:50.68]I'm so glad we found him!
[05:52.68]Etalyx!
[05:53.64]Land ho!
[05:56.28]Whoa!
[05:57.76]Alright, you guys don't...
[06:00.78]I think I found food, and I think I'm holding it.
[06:03.08]Oh, it's an MRE.
[06:05.58]But I think I want to eat it.
[06:06.78]You're going to give that food to me?
[06:09.32]I'm at 18%.
[06:09.67]I want to put that back down to zero.
[06:11.59]I have 85%.
[06:13.53]You're dropping that food.
[06:15.79]Put that food down.
[06:17.53]Put it down.
[06:19.38]I will catch up to you.
[06:22.38]We got a runner.
[06:24.17]I'm at 90... You... I can't believe you ate that food.
[06:28.49]He dropped it.
[06:29.33]He dropped it.
[06:29.83]It's on the ground.
