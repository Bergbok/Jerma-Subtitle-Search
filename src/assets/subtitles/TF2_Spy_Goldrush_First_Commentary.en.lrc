[00:01.84]Hello, everybody.
[00:02.82]I'm going to introduce myself right here.
[00:06.26]My name is Jerma.
[00:08.22]I'm going to start doing gameplay commentaries.
[00:10.64]Some people might already know me from playing in servers, but some of you probably don't, and this is my introduction to you guys.
[00:18.50]I'm not just going to do Team Fortress commentaries.
[00:20.32]I'm going to do other stuff too, but most notably I'll do Team Fortress stuff because I love the game.
[00:25.43]It is my absolute favorite game in the world right now.
[00:30.01]It has been for a while.
[00:31.45]I've been playing Team Fortress since beta.
[00:34.49]And before that, I played Team Fortress Classic for three or four years also.
[00:38.29]So, I'm a huge fan of the series.
[00:41.84]And when Team Fortress 3 crumbs out, when Team Fortress 3 crumbs out, I'll be getting that too.
[00:48.10]So, I'm playing right now.
[00:52.14]I jumped in a little late here.
[00:54.03]This is Gold Rush.
[00:56.11]I'm playing Dead Ringer Spy with Kunai.
[00:58.74]And the Latorenga, whatever, however you pronounce it.
[01:01.38]I believe it's Latranger.
[01:04.08]I think that's how you actually say it.
[01:06.15]But you know what?
[01:06.57]I don't give a shit about name pronunciations.
[01:08.37]Who cares?
[01:08.81]This is a gameplay commentary.
[01:09.91]You guys want to see me kill shit.
[01:11.63]So, as I said, I'm the Dead Ringer.
[01:14.09]This is Gold Rush.
[01:14.79]They're pushing the last point.
[01:16.21]I'm on defense.
[01:17.71]And this scout stood still for too long, so that means he's dead.
[01:21.41]A Pyro lights me on fire, and I want you guys to pay attention to something.
[01:24.30]This is really, really weird.
[01:26.18]So I'm on fire right now, okay?
[01:28.64]So I better look for some health or get healed by a medic or something.
[01:32.42]You would expect me to do that, right?
[01:34.72]So, I don't, and my life doesn't really go anywhere.
[01:39.14]But I'm still on fire.
[01:40.92]And for the remainder of this video, I'm going to be on fire.
[01:47.62]See, I just picked up health kit right there, but it doesn't matter, I'm still on fire.
[01:52.22]I don't understand why that happened, that there was something going on in the video editing process.
[01:56.34]Kill that heavy, I think that medic was about to charge an uber or something, but he jumps to his death.
[02:02.84]And I don't know why I did that, to tell you the truth.
[02:04.57]He could have just ran backwards, but... So I'm still on fire.
[02:07.73]Let me pick this health kit up again.
[02:09.15]Still on fire.
[02:10.69]I'm not sure if it's a bug, like I said, but... I love Dead Ringer.
[02:14.73]I love The Spy.
[02:15.39]It's my most played class.
[02:18.17]Next to that it's... I think it's Engineer.
[02:21.68]Yeah, it is.
[02:22.46]I think 100 hours or something.
[02:24.90]But, Dead Ringer, people will complain and say, well, Dead Ringer is for retarded people that are stupid, and they don't.
[02:33.32]This spy, by the way, notices that I, he heard the noise, but he doesn't try and come after me.
[02:37.94]You know, usually you turn around and want to go after somebody when you hear the loud Dead Ringer noise, but he doesn't seem to care.
[02:43.69]So up here, I get this heavy, miss with a stab, but I get him anyways.
[02:47.83]This sniper, I get him as well with the
[02:51.47]revolver, which this revolver is hard to kill people with because you have to shoot them.
[02:54.49]I think it's at least three or four times if you have 125 health or 150 health like some of the classes do.
[03:01.47]But this scout, I think he's a spy.
[03:03.45]He thinks I'm a spy.
[03:04.31]We both go, haha.
[03:05.91]Now watch this part right here.
[03:06.89]I don't understand this part and you'll get a laugh out of this.
[03:09.36]This is a spy and we both know it, but he just keeps on walking.
[03:15.94]Apparently he didn't care that I bumped into him.
[03:20.34]Or that I was a spy.
[03:21.18]I don't even know.
[03:22.24]I thought he was a bot at first, and then I found out that he wasn't.
[03:27.92]So if that was you, shame on you.
[03:31.06]And maybe you'll get better by practicing.
[03:34.60]So right now I'm just kind of trying to lure somebody out here.
[03:36.97]The soldier, I get him.
[03:38.73]And that's what it's all about with the spy.
[03:40.97]Just trying to mess with people's heads.
[03:42.99]And if you notice, I walk sideways and I walk backwards a lot.
[03:47.19]Because if you walk right at people, as a lot of you know...
[03:50.70]You're a definite guaranteed spy.
[03:52.30]See, I'm trying to pretend like this scout is my enemy.
[03:55.28]And I fooled this spy.
[03:58.19]But it doesn't matter because I'd miss anyways.
[04:00.79]And nothing happens from it, though.
[04:02.51]He didn't really come after me.
[04:04.93]That's the same spy who killed this engineer.
[04:07.71]I believe that's the same spy that, when he heard me uncloak, he didn't really come after me.
[04:12.22]He just kind of shot in random directions and that was it.
[04:15.00]So I get this medic and I get the soldier.
[04:16.78]I have ruined their days.
[04:19.16]And...
[04:20.69]This is, like I said, the last part of Gold Rush.
[04:23.81]I started a little late, but it's okay, because this is a pretty good run, and I'm still on fire.
[04:30.34]Nice little jumping, little side-stab on that Medic.
[04:33.46]And, yeah, I had to bring up the Dead Ringer, because there's no way I would have survived that at all.
[04:38.93]Which is the best part about the Dead Ringer, because if you had a regular invisibility watch, half of these situations you'd be dead.
[04:45.47]I'd say probably more than half.
[04:47.35]So, I try to telefrag this Engineer.
[04:49.92]And it doesn't really go so well, because he's obviously not in the way.
[04:53.16]He actually hits me with his wrench, and it doesn't kill me.
[04:57.12]I think I was overhealed.
[04:57.86]I think he critted me, actually, to tell you the truth.
[05:00.72]See, right now, I'm in no man's land, because there's just so many people around, and this heavy knows it, so I go down.
[05:06.38]And everyone doesn't really hear it, but I just kind of freak out.
[05:10.66]There's too many people for me to even really do anything significant, but hey, I tried, and that's when I died.
[05:17.48]So look, I'm still on fire.
[05:20.00]I'm still on fire.
[05:21.52]I've yet to be put out.
[05:23.50]And it wasn't like this when I was playing, by the way.
[05:26.22]Only when I saved the video.
[05:29.83]So I guess there's some kind of bug with demo files where it does this.
[05:35.90]And it really...
[05:37.24]is kind of annoying and hopefully it doesn't do this more often.
[05:39.96]If you guys do commentaries, if you guys can give me some tips on what exactly could be going on here, I have no idea, but I'm not going to let it ruin my day.
[05:49.11]It actually subsides right here.
[05:51.77]I had to cut to... I think something crashed, so... But yeah, it's gone now and this is still the same life from what it was before when I walked out.
[06:01.03]I just had to cut it.
[06:02.45]So I take the
[06:04.06]Hit from the heavy, bring out the Dead Ringer, go back to the little spot here.
[06:06.96]This is a great place to go.
[06:08.63]If you don't go here, you should go here every time.
[06:11.85]Kill that soldier, but that other soldier is not going to have any in that.
[06:15.87]If you're using the Dead Ringer, that's a really good place to go.
[06:19.01]Because nobody... I believe when you're behind a wall, the sound of the D-Club of the Dead Ringer is very silent.
[06:27.55]So we're at the last 10 seconds here, and we are winning this, and obviously I come out here to demoralize the other team.
[06:39.15]And it was a pretty good run, and hopefully you guys liked it, and if you did, let me know.
[06:45.35]Give me a comment, let me know if you want to see something else, or if you guys want to see more.
[06:50.17]I plan on doing it at least a little bit to try and, you know,
[06:53.64]try and get into it, but thanks for watching, and hopefully you guys enjoyed.
[06:56.92]I'll see you later.
