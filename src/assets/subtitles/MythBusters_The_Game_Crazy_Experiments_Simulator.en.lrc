[00:03.85]What's up?
[00:05.07]How's it going?
[00:19.00]The title is wrong?
[00:19.84]Yeah, it's bad, isn't it?
[00:27.88]Autocorrect and spellcheck have ruined society.
[00:31.97]Hold on, I'm about to burp.
[00:33.21]This is, you hear this?
[00:33.95]This is like I'm about to burp voice.
[00:36.03]I'm holding onto it for a minute.
[00:40.41]That sounded like I was about to cry.
[00:42.03]Autocorrect and spellcheck have ruined society.
[00:48.49]Let me tell you why.
[00:49.47]Honestly, I just type shit and if it's going to be completely wrong, I don't even care.
[00:54.75]The computer's going to tell me what I need to fix.
[01:00.57]I just didn't right-click it and fix it.
[01:03.05]I don't care.
[01:03.57]Leave it.
[01:09.10]This looks like I was shit-faced.
[01:10.54]Oh, yeah, let's do some science experiments, I guess.
[01:12.92]Tweet that out.
[01:23.71]Alright, hello.
[01:24.31]Hi.
[01:24.75]Haven't seen you in four days or so.
[01:26.91]Haven't seen you in a while.

[01:39.31]What would you guys do with chanting kill?
[01:43.93]What's wrong with you guys?
[01:45.27]You guys need to relax.
[01:48.93]Kill?
[01:49.33]I mean, I could understand being incredibly upset with.

[01:58.00]Okay, from now on, write, we're upset with you.
[02:02.03]Not a hill.
[02:08.84]Welcome to a little late night stream.
[02:14.10]I'll be just hanging out late night.
[02:18.49]There was an announcement from a game that I like, which we'll be checking that out this coming week here, I think on Thursday.
[02:31.63]A Gizmo is in Multiverses.
[02:34.41]He's coming to Multiverses.
[02:36.11]That's literally one of my favorite movie franchises ever made.
[02:38.17]I am going to main Gizmo.
[02:42.58]I don't care how bad the character is with me.
[02:44.96]I don't care how bad I am with it.
[02:49.92]Gizmo from Gremlins is in Multiverses.
[02:51.94]It's coming this week.
[02:55.50]Yeah, everybody's like, oh yeah, man, I can't wait for Rick.
[02:59.76]Dude, I can't wait.
[03:00.82]Oh, man.
[03:02.08]Oh, Walter White, baby.
[03:04.40]Gizmo got in before all of your favorite characters.
[03:08.42]My favorite character got in and none of you even know who it is.
[03:22.25]No, I'm very curious.
[03:29.72]By the way, yeah, this game has mostly negative reviews on Steam.
[03:33.60]I don't, I don't, I just, we were in pre-stream and I was like, you know what, fine, how about Mythbusters?
[03:40.72]This is a mostly negative game.
[03:42.50]Is it gonna be, is it that bad?
[03:44.58]I don't think so.
[03:45.24]Wait, let's check it out.
[03:46.14]Mostly negative.
[04:00.15]The other options were worse?
[04:02.01]Excuse me?
[04:07.01]Cult of the Lamb and 20 Minutes Till Dawn.
[04:10.34]Excuse me?
[04:11.18]I'm very curious.
[04:19.66]Let's try it.
[04:22.99]What if this is amazing?
[04:24.41]What if you guys... Okay, what if this is really fun?
[04:27.27]I'm ready to do some experiments.
[04:39.57]A bad review game usually is a good game for you.
[04:41.79]For you.
[04:44.37]Alright, um, let's go.
[04:49.85]I'm ready to play.
[04:54.14]I think I have it set to go.
[05:02.52]Bane?
[05:02.92]Yep.
[05:04.14]Oh, hold on a second.
[05:05.96]Wait.
[05:06.64]No, I'm not going to say it.
[05:09.33]There's a ton of new people in the community over the last year or so.
[05:13.83]Should we get a new opinion on the Bane voice?
[05:15.49]I feel like there's a lot of new people here over the last 24 months.
[05:23.73]I feel like it's going to be... I think people are going to like it.
[05:27.00]I think people will think it's good.
[05:28.88]There's so much more people here.
[05:29.76]There's so much more of a sample.
[05:30.60]Alright, let's go.
[05:34.33]Here it is.
[05:36.33]And snap my fingers.
[05:38.33]Snap!
[05:39.51]There I am too.
[05:40.09]I hope I wasn't naked in that frame, but whatever.
[05:43.54]I don't care.
[05:44.12]Alright, let's go.
[05:48.40]Mythbusters Crazy Experiments Simulator.
[05:51.16]Are we all here?
[05:56.13]Should I go?
[05:56.51]Oh, you need to hear the music.
[06:05.73]Alright, let's go!
[06:07.74]So what do you do?
[06:08.56]We pick an ex- Whoa, this is crashing my computer.
[06:14.74]Hold on, I gotta put... Welcome to MythBusters The Game.
[06:16.99]Soon you'll be able to play the role of a real MythBuster.
[06:20.05]Each myth will have its own unique gameplay mechanics, which you will encounter during the finalization and testing of the experiment.
[06:26.00]Have fun!
[06:26.70]Let's go.
[06:34.50]Okay, hold on.
[06:43.35]It's 1.0?
[06:47.05]God damn it.
[06:54.17]I can't make it lower than this.
[07:01.84]I gotta go into my actual mouse DPI.
[07:03.12]Okay.
[07:06.56]It's in mouse settings, right?
[07:07.88]Mouse settings.
[07:11.06]Cursor speed, let's put it at... I don't know, like here?
[07:19.89]Myth busted.
[07:20.63]Yeah.
[07:25.87]Okay, let me see if that helps.
[07:29.77]Alright, I don't know what to do.
[07:37.04]I just turned my mouse sensitivity at a hardware level down.
[07:45.10]How do I fix this?
[07:52.82]How do I fix this?
[07:55.24]Lower your DPI?
[07:56.10]Isn't that what I just did?
[07:57.52]Hold on, is this DPI?
[08:00.29]Hold on.
[08:01.49]Hardware.
[08:03.40]Wheel pointer options?
[08:04.86]Pointer speed?
[08:05.70]How do I turn the DPI down on my fucking mouse?
[08:09.52]Cursor speed is not DPI.
[08:11.28]Well, where's DPI?
[08:15.94]It's not in Windows?
[08:17.26]Where is it?
[08:23.94]Wait, it's not Windows mouse speed?
[08:27.80]Whatever.
[08:28.18]Okay, I'll deal with it.
[08:29.68]Can I use the controller?
[08:33.00]Okay, go to the myth board in order to choose a myth.
[08:37.50]Not a whole lot going on here.
[08:40.76]That's like we got one.
[08:43.80]Put it on, stick it on the wall.
[08:48.35]We're about to make our first $40.
[08:53.96]Okay, Hero's Gambit.
[08:55.92]Action movie heroes tend to find ways to survive a grenade blast within seconds.
[09:00.19]Is it possible to survive a grenade explosion by covering it with an object and hiding behind a suitable cover?
[09:04.73]A bucket?
[09:06.07]A barrel?
[09:06.89]Or maybe a wooden box?
[09:08.53]What would be the best way to stop the explosion?
[09:12.09]Why are we jumping on grenades?
[09:16.82]Oh, plug with the Mythbusters, man!
[09:18.34]First myth of the day!
[09:19.92]Gary's gonna jump on a grenade!
[09:22.38]and fucking explode and we'll see how many what what's the point of this it's gonna be one episode of this show um okay uh okay unlock experience run for your life test the firepower of a grenade save the mock-up from okay so I accept it now you're going to pick the first myth for testing the goal of the game is to get as popular as possible
[09:50.27]while still having enough budget for your experiments.
[09:53.83]During the game, you will get cards to assemble episodes.
[09:58.69]Wait, we have to actually make the show?
[10:01.64]Appropriate usage of those cards in the episode will allow you to gain higher popularity and budget.
[10:06.20]Alright.
[10:07.78]Alright, let's go.
[10:11.18]Here's my team.
[10:12.14]Okay, this is... Celebrities can make the audience stick around.
[10:18.19]His knowledge will be an immense help during your endeavors.
[10:21.79]And he has been working with guns and explosives for years.
[10:25.89]Well, I mean, it's going to be this guy.
[10:30.44]You bring the explosives expert.
[10:32.18]You don't... I mean, yeah, that's correct, right?
[10:39.48]Let's go.
[10:39.84]So how do we do the experiment?
[10:44.86]How to survive a grenade?
[10:48.47]It's called... Pick it up off the fucking ground and throw it back!
[10:55.50]How's that?
[10:59.10]Okay, test the firepower of a grenade.
[11:06.84]What is going on?
[11:08.14]Wait, hold on.
[11:09.20]My brain is confused.
[11:11.29]Where are we?
[11:13.89]Test the firepower of a grenade.
[11:15.65]Save the mock-up from destruction.
[11:17.77]Alright, um... Click and drag to throw the ball.
[11:24.41]Did I just drop it on my leg?
[11:26.31]What happened?
[11:37.64]This is a long cook time on this grenade.
[11:47.00]Did I do it?
[11:47.88]Where's the grenade?
[11:58.93]Determine the area percentage.
[12:00.65]Click within a body to fill it.
[12:05.25]What?
[12:05.39]What happened?
[12:06.97]Wait, what?
[12:08.73]I don't understand what's happening.
[12:13.85]Click within a body to fill it.
[12:15.03]Select apply button.
[12:16.51]How?
[12:16.83]It has to be at 5%?
[12:17.55]I'm so confused.
[12:34.33]What's happening?
[12:37.25]The right side?
[12:40.25]What does it want me to do?
[12:43.65]I don't know what it's asking.
[12:45.83]Read the number on the right.
[12:48.22]Bill 36%.
[12:50.90]I mean... Is this like 36?
[12:54.17]Oh, alright.
[12:56.95]I get it.
[12:57.25]I get it.
[12:57.51]Okay.
[13:00.12]Wait.
[13:00.96]Oh, we're making the grenade.
[13:02.48]I get it.
[13:02.82]Alright.
[13:03.10]Oh, this is easy.
[13:03.78]I get it.
[13:04.10]Oh my God.
[13:04.72]I just, I don't like this.
[13:06.90]Okay.
[13:07.10]We need to move.
[13:08.08]Oh my.

[13:23.16]Oh Jesus Christ.
[13:24.84]Okay.
[13:25.16]Hold on.
[13:25.55]Uh,

[13:35.32]I don't have to do anything fancy.
[13:36.48]Alright, let's go.
[13:42.20]Solve the equation by moving the specified number of sticks.
[13:46.18]Oh, fuck.
[13:52.11]I don't think they did this on the show.
[13:54.13]Okay, 7 times 3 equals 9 plus... I can move two sticks...
[14:03.21]the book of bathroom brain teasers that I used to have.
[14:07.33]Um, what's the answer?
[14:08.17]I don't even care.
[14:09.23]Is it one times three?
[14:15.44]One times three equals, um, seven times three equals nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[14:24.14]That's not, that's not 21.
[14:24.67]Um,

[14:31.90]What is it?
[14:36.73]7 times 2?
[14:36.97]Alright, 7 times 2.
[14:38.81]How do I do that?
[14:47.25]Oh.
[14:48.61]Alright, we made the grenade.
[14:49.47]Alright, I made the grenade.
[14:52.39]I got it.
[14:52.71]It just blows up in my hands.
[14:58.77]Okay, time to do it.
[15:03.94]Run for- Prepare the grenade and build a test mockup.
[15:06.34]When you are ready, place everything on the testing ground so the test mockup does not get destroyed.
[15:09.85]Okay.
[15:17.17]Additional objectives, alright.
[15:18.31]Okay, page number.
[15:24.62]Shooting range.

[15:31.17]I don't fucking care.
[15:32.77]Let's go.
[15:33.33]Let's go to the fun part where I can experiment.
[15:35.23]Alright, assembly mode.
[15:43.86]Look, I just want to be the fucking celebrity that walks on and just has the safety goggles and is like, ho, ho, ho!
[15:51.22]That's all my lines.
[15:52.12]I don't do anything.
[15:52.66]I have my own air-conditioned trailer.

[17:21.97]Spending all my money.
[17:22.87]By the way, isn't this my workshop?
[17:26.65]Why would I need to buy things in my own workshop?
[17:30.09]Alright, wooden plank.
[17:30.83]I need six.
[17:35.29]They don't show this process on TV.
[17:39.57]Alright, check your notebooks on page three.

[21:13.06]What the fuck was that?
[21:14.26]Oh, okay, I get it.
[21:24.58]Wooden plank piece.
[21:35.14]You don't want to be going fast in this environment.
[21:37.77]There shouldn't be points for speed.
[21:43.93]Okay.
[21:44.55]So I got everything?

[22:09.60]When creating a map, it may be... Alright.
[22:11.82]So I need a hammer?
[22:14.18]Okay, I need a hammer.
[22:14.88]I got a hammer.
[22:17.94]Hammer.
[22:19.87]Go to the big workshop and make a mock-up.
[22:25.31]Aww.
[22:25.57]Alright, here we go.
[22:26.63]Test mock-up.
[22:41.50]I don't want to... I just... I'll be honest.
[22:43.10]I just didn't want to read any of that.
[22:44.86]I didn't want to read any of it.
[22:47.16]Any of it.
[22:47.83]I didn't read a sentence.
[22:49.23]It's good, right?
[23:06.39]Okay, it's in.
[23:08.11]Now...
[23:09.54]We... What the fuck am I making?
[23:11.42]What is this?
[23:14.66]I'm making a shitty mailbox for like my second grade class.
[23:19.17]What is this supposed to be?
[23:20.03]Um... Middle with bonnet, middle with cowboy hat.
[24:11.34]Oh, you bet your ass if I was on this episode, I would be like, yeah, let me do it.
[24:14.26]I'd be like hitting it with the hammer and I would hit it hard and pretend my thumb got hit and go like, oh, and put it in my mouth and shit.
[24:31.35]What am I doing?
[24:32.53]What am I doing with this?
[24:34.39]Okay, put it on the truck.
[24:45.16]Okay, head to the shooting range.
[24:49.00]Ow.
[24:51.66]Oh.

[25:07.61]Okay, the cleanup crew is coming.
[25:11.67]So what?
[25:17.65]Check your notebook on page 6.
[25:28.22]Start the myth and activate explosives.
[25:31.28]Use to reduce the radius of the explosion with shields.
[25:35.06]Use to reduce the radius of the explosion and space for all large tests.
[25:38.52]What do you want?
[25:42.83]Lethal zone.
[25:45.28]Okay.
[25:46.98]Here you will start the experiment and start the test sequence.
[25:49.12]You will need to have an appropriate tool in order to start.
[25:51.07]I need a button.
[25:52.85]Okay.
[25:54.01]Take the test mock-up to the sa- Alright, let's go.
[26:06.70]Where is it?
[26:07.12]It's on the truck?
[26:16.70]Okay, we didn't really need to bring the whole truck for this.
[26:18.55]I gotta put this in the back of somebody's car.
[26:21.17]We didn't need to bring the truck for one item.
[26:22.95]Where is it?
[26:26.69]Where's my, uh, cardboard cutout?
[26:29.03]Take the test, mock up to the safe zone.
[26:30.81]Where is it?
[26:33.87]I loaded it in the truck.
[26:35.15]What happened?
[26:36.55]It escaped.
[26:43.21]What?
[26:45.01]Dude, you're the test.
[26:51.41]Is it in my inventory?
[26:57.05]No, where is it?
[27:08.88]It's behind the truck, what?
[27:22.42]No, it's not!
[27:23.18]Where is it?
[27:34.57]Hey!
[27:36.57]Um... Where is it?
[27:45.84]Uh...
[27:50.36]Is it not there?
[27:51.05]Am I soft locked?
[27:53.45]I have to make a new one, loser.
[28:04.54]Go to the shooting range.
[28:06.52]It was on the stand there, was it?
[28:10.60]It told me I didn't have to take it out of the truck.
[28:20.82]Who do you think drove you there?
[28:23.00]That's funny.
[28:26.00]Where is he?
[28:31.50]Where is this thing?
[28:33.04]Where is this guy?
[28:34.32]I'm serious.
[28:35.22]Where is he?
[28:39.01]The grenade's still on the shop's table?
[28:40.63]No, it's not.
[28:41.23]I have it in my inventory.
[28:47.65]That guy didn't want to die.
[28:50.47]Where is he?
[28:54.15]Look behind you?
[28:55.35]On a stand?
[28:56.07]He's not here.
[29:05.47]No, behind you.
[29:10.13]Check the box, maybe?
[29:17.81]I think it's fucked up.
[29:20.30]I think it's screwed up.
[29:21.30]I think I have to restart it.
[29:26.04]Large menu items?
[29:35.62]It's in the house?
[29:37.08]It's where the arrow is pointing.
[29:38.40]Yeah, there's nothing there.
[29:39.14]I can't do anything about it.
[29:49.45]Yeah, take the test mock-up to the safe zone, which is here.
[29:52.03]Box in front of the truck.
[30:03.48]Shit!
[30:15.09]Wait, what's this?
[30:21.16]What's this?
[30:21.86]No.
[30:25.94]Wait, was it really?
[30:26.64]It was not there.
[30:35.06]I think it's gone.
[30:36.41]I just think it's gone.
[30:37.09]Okay.
[30:44.31]I don't even know what items those were.
[30:48.01]Did I actually lose it?
[31:02.74]Fuck.
[31:06.50]Uh, I actually think it's screwed up.
[31:09.90]Oh, that's not good.
[31:13.96]Um, what do I do?
[31:15.96]Should I start over?
[31:16.54]I don't think I want to start.
[31:18.83]Should I start over, man?
[31:19.79]I feel like all you guys are going to leave.
[31:25.29]Who raided?
[31:25.79]Is it raid?
[31:29.45]I don't even see who.
[31:30.17]I can't see who raided.
[31:37.57]We didn't rejoin.
[31:44.10]Wait, who?
[31:44.48]Slime?
[31:45.88]SlimeCycleRaid, what's up?
[31:50.28]Hey, we just started the stream.
[31:52.46]Thanks a lot, SlimeCycle, appreciate it.
[31:54.15]Welcome everybody from SlimeCycle's stream.
[31:56.43]We're just getting started here.
[31:58.49]Gonna be busting some myths.
[32:00.31]Just turned the stream on for the first time.
[32:03.77]You joined at the perfect opportunity.
[32:06.53]Time to bust some myths!
[32:09.94]What do we got today for our first one?
[32:14.02]Run for your life, but I have to make a grenade?
[32:15.76]This is fucking different than last time, what?
[32:37.04]What?
[32:42.58]Did I win?
[32:43.09]Skip it.
[32:54.23]Skip.
[32:54.45]I don't care.
[33:24.82]Fuck!
[33:26.23]Just skip it.
[33:27.01]Fail it over and over again.
[33:36.20]Look, I'm too stupid, see?
[33:55.46]Alright, we got the grenade.
[33:56.16]We're good.
[34:02.16]Okay, cool.
[34:04.70]Yep.
[34:08.60]Cool, got it.
[34:10.42]Alright, let's go get the items.
[34:23.03]How many nails?
[34:23.49]Seven?
[34:24.35]One?
[34:25.39]Wasn't it seven?
[34:26.05]It was seven nails last time.
[34:29.58]I'm so confused.
[34:36.96]What's wrong with my guy?
[34:37.80]This fucking music is fucked.
[34:50.11]How many do I...
[34:57.64]Three wooden planks.
[34:58.46]I need the start button.
[35:02.91]Okay, cool.
[35:12.86]Yep, I got it.
[35:57.89]I won't laugh.
[35:59.47]You laugh, you lose.
[36:00.31]If I laugh, I have to turn the stream off.
[36:14.42]Why turn the music down?
[36:16.00]This doesn't count.
[36:16.94]This doesn't count.
[36:21.05]The music is at fucking 0%.
[36:28.62]Okay, it was the radio.
[36:31.02]No, starting now.
[36:31.62]That doesn't count.
[36:32.25]Starting now.
[36:32.67]Starting now.
[36:33.25]If I laugh, I'll turn the stream off.
[36:58.50]you
[37:36.75]Where's the sound?
[37:39.35]Why is there no sound?
[37:48.46]It's going to get DMCA.
[38:01.44]Whatever.
[38:01.74]I don't really care.
[38:34.50]We're just doing just generic.
[38:38.39]Just generic.
[38:39.05]I'm not adding anything weird.
[38:40.23]Just right side.
[38:42.52]Left's just generic.
[39:07.61]Okay, take item.
[39:09.99]I'm holding it in my hands right now.
[39:12.52]Into the truck.
[39:14.14]Bring it to the truck.
[39:17.02]Okay, I'm in the truck.
[39:20.18]Drop in the truck.
[39:24.00]That didn't do that last time.
[39:25.52]I don't know what it did last time, but not that.
[39:27.68]I'm ready.
[39:33.30]I'm running to the beat.
[39:36.82]Let's go.
[39:47.54]There we go, yes!
[40:44.26]What?
[40:44.63]Hey, hey, hey!
[41:12.40]What do I do?
[41:14.33]I don't know what to do.
[42:00.53]What's the point of this guy?
[42:03.53]What's the point of this guy?
[42:09.59]Leave it on the board?
[42:10.65]Put the Tessa objects in the appropriate slots and protect them from the explosion.
[42:42.39]I can't fucking take it anymore.
[42:43.59]I can't.
[42:43.87]It's been six minutes.
[42:44.66]I have to turn it off.
[42:51.35]Okay.
[43:20.76]Wow!
[43:23.30]Whoa!
[43:44.33]Wait, I can edit the episode?
[44:00.46]Okay, go to your laptop.
[44:04.50]There's shit everywhere.
[44:09.41]Okay, I can edit the video.
[44:12.43]That scared me.
[44:15.35]I don't know what that was.
[44:17.53]That was actually terrifying.
[44:19.59]Okay.
[44:22.33]My nice messages from fans.
[44:23.88]Okay.
[44:25.36]Progress.
[44:26.58]And then the MythMaker Studio.
[44:29.57]Alright, let's go for it.
[44:31.53]Each episode has five empty slots that can be filled with collected cards.
[44:35.62]Alright, we said Sergeant Daniel is there.
[44:44.16]Each episode is 45 minutes.
[44:45.32]Wait, we're going to spend 20 minutes targeting Sergeant Daniel?
[44:56.34]Sounds pretty good to me.
[45:12.86]Good afternoon.
[45:13.50]We have a great idea for an experiment.
[45:15.77]Consider this.
[45:16.93]Can a chair with enough balloons fly?
[45:18.81]I hope we understand each other.
[45:21.31]Waiting for some good material.
[45:23.23]That means they don't like the show.
[45:29.88]Your show's really nice.
[45:30.70]I like it very much.
[45:31.48]I like it.
[45:31.96]Good show.
[45:32.48]Good luck in your future endeavors.
[45:33.86]Hey, thanks.
[45:34.52]Thanks, Michael Brown.
[45:43.10]Cool.
[45:43.50]Alright.
[45:44.02]Do I sleep in this?
[45:47.97]Go to the myth board.
[45:48.87]Alright.
[45:52.71]Where's the myth board?
[45:53.41]Oh, right here.
[45:56.27]Of course.
[45:59.77]Balloon chair.
[46:00.51]Alright.
[46:00.81]I'm doing balloon chair and then I'm never playing this game again.
[46:11.18]Yeah, sure.
[46:11.68]Why not?
[46:17.30]I don't want to make a g- I don't want to make a grenade for the balloon chair.
[46:19.81]I don't f- I don't un- what do you want me to do?
[46:50.93]Oh, I got it.
[46:51.47]Alright, cool.
[46:52.25]Sick.
[46:52.49]This game's sick!
[46:54.70]How many degrees does a right angle have? 90!
[47:37.58]Alright, we got it!
[47:41.05]Okay, time to go and check my notebook.
[47:47.31]This game's cute.
[47:49.29]This game's cute.
[47:50.53]Come on.
[47:51.56]This is cute.
[47:52.26]Okay.
[47:56.04]Pork?
[47:56.92]Wait, why am I getting pork for?
[47:58.42]Is the MythBuster to make a pork chop sandwich for somebody?
[48:03.67]How many bottles?
[48:10.62]He loathes it.
[48:13.38]I didn't say that.
[48:15.68]How many more bottles of water do I need?
[48:17.16]Water times one.
[48:20.18]Water times one.
[48:21.16]How many waters do... Oh, this is a bottle.
[48:22.92]Never mind.
[48:23.65]I thought it was... They're blue!
[48:24.79]I thought they were water bottles.
[48:25.63]Whatever.
[48:31.39]Where's the... Oh.
[48:31.79]Okay.
[48:35.41]Cool.
[48:35.85]Let's assemble it.
[48:38.72]This is my favorite part.
[48:40.98]Go to the pump station.
[49:09.11]Put gelatin in the bucket?
[49:17.03]No, not cement.
[49:30.88]What do I do?
[49:31.62]Press the valve?
[49:32.24]Press and hold the valve.
[49:34.38]I like the way this sounds.
[49:41.74]How do I do it?
[49:42.64]Press and hold the valve?
[49:45.53]Check the ballistic gel proportions.
[49:53.69]What does that mean?
[49:58.67]I need 10-20% pork gel and 80-90% water.
[50:02.40]Oh shit, hold on.
[50:10.40]Whoa, that's way too much!
[50:11.72]Oops.
[50:19.93]Everybody alright?
[50:20.41]Nobody move, nobody's got glass in them or anything?
[50:23.29]No, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, hold on.
[50:32.28]Uh, I can, let's go.
[50:32.76]20%.
[50:32.78]Oh, come on.
[50:33.02]20%.
[50:33.04]And then, 80% water.
[50:54.21]Like that, right?
[50:56.83]We good?
[50:58.53]Oh, dude, fucking science.
[51:09.05]Holistic gel hand.
[51:20.78]Oh, dude, science.
[51:29.98]Do we have a ballistic gel hand?
[51:33.04]Dude, that's only possible with freaking science.
[51:37.72]Make a second hand?
[51:38.70]Well, why did you tell me to make... Oh.
[51:49.54]Science actually is pretty cool.
[51:51.37]It is.
[51:51.67]It's fun.
[51:53.56]Look, I will take science over math.
[51:58.14]I will take science over social studies.
[52:01.15]I will take science over English class.
[52:04.31]Every single time.
[52:05.53]No matter what.
[52:06.11]Every time.
[52:11.67]Make a second hand?
[52:14.05]Oh.
[52:22.25]That's wrong.
[52:23.79]What about geography?
[52:25.89]No.
[52:31.14]I would have liked school a lot more if it was like 40% science class.
[52:40.64]Like 20% gym.
[52:43.85]And then 40%.
[52:44.21]No.
[52:44.27]Alright.
[52:44.95]30% science.
[52:45.45]20% gym.
[52:53.79]20% lunch.
[52:57.33]And then, like, 30%, uh, like, who invented stuff.
[53:04.72]That would be cool to me.
[53:11.12]Like, inventors 101.
[53:12.82]Like, oh, we learn about, like, every invention that ever was invented and who made it and what their patents are and shit.
[53:17.14]Kind of fucking cool, don't you think?
[53:23.56]Oh, and what credit score is.
[53:25.94]And how to write a check, and what taxes are.
[53:29.44]Would've been kind of nice if they told us that.
[53:31.71]You know, just saying.
[53:39.53]Alright, let's open the notebook.
[53:44.98]Alright, so here we go.
[53:46.32]It's time to do this.
[53:49.90]I need the wrench.
[53:50.88]We're gonna put the thing together.
[53:53.98]This is cute.
[53:56.40]Okay, item checklist.
[53:57.30]Let's go.
[53:57.66]I'm ready.
[54:04.79]You're 40.
[54:05.35]You should know by now.
[54:06.23]Well, I do now, and I have for the last probably 5 to 10 years.
[54:10.03]I did not know this until I was probably in my early to mid-20s.
[54:13.17]It took way too long.
[54:15.40]It shouldn't have waited until I was like 25 to understand all this stuff.
[54:19.38]Like 23, 24, 25, 26.
[54:27.89]I knew what it was, but I didn't understand how it worked.
[54:30.47]And you know what?
[54:32.61]Sometimes I still kind of don't understand how the fuck that works.
[54:35.50]Because it's different everywhere.
[54:39.78]Alright, I need the parts to craft the buster.
[54:46.81]Collect all needed- aren't they all here?
[54:52.81]Teenagers don't know to know credit scores.
[54:54.87]No, but teenagers that grow into adults need to know what a credit score is.
[54:59.63]And teenagers that grow into adults need to know about, like, financial literacy and all the things that come with it.
[55:05.60]I don't know why we wait so long.
[55:13.20]Okay, cool.
[55:16.10]Where do I get this stuff?
[55:16.80]Collect all the needed parts.
[55:17.82]What is it?
[55:18.41]I need steel rod 15.
[55:27.20]Oh, they're not going to help me anymore.
[55:28.24]The tutorial's over.
[55:29.32]Okay.
[55:30.94]I need 15 steel rods.
[55:31.84]Where are those?
[55:36.31]Oh, just spend all my money on cement?
[55:37.95]You got it.
[55:38.25]I don't know why that feels like a MrBeast video.
[55:49.56]I filled this pool with cement!
[55:53.26]Up to my neck!
[56:00.79]Uh, where is it?
[56:07.67]Steel rods?
[56:09.46]Oh, here we go.
[56:15.84]Steel pipe?
[56:17.62]Steel rod piece.
[56:21.18]I don't know what any of this means.
[56:24.08]steel rod piece just buy five of them this is what this is what I would do I would just buy five of these and just bring it to the contract and go you might this might be way more but just keep whatever you keep and use whatever you don't need like for another project you don't have to pay me I don't care I just want to make sure it's right alright so 15 oh I need more than that 15 how many did I buy five
[56:52.04]Okay.
[56:53.28]13 screws, any buster head, buster torso, buster pelvis, buster limb, buster hand, buster foot.
[56:58.30]What is that?
[56:58.78]Alright, 13 screws.
[57:00.20]Okay, where's buster?
[57:08.65]Buster head?
[57:10.99]Buster hand?
[57:16.89]What is that in construction terms?
[57:19.39]What is a buster head, a buster torso, a buster...
[57:22.96]Arm, what is that?
[57:30.10]Buster, wait, where is this?
[57:32.22]Oh, it's the dummy.
[57:35.32]Where do I find the dummy?
[57:36.60]What's the name of the dummy?
[57:37.40]Well, okay.
[57:41.00]Oh, Buster!
[57:43.84]I gotta cut up this steel rod.
[57:50.40]Where's the saw bench?
[57:56.10]Where's the saw bench?
[57:56.90]I forget where it is.
[57:57.51]There it is.
[58:01.83]Alright, I need steel rod keys.
[58:04.75]Ah!
[58:08.55]Saw blade damaged?
[58:09.51]What are you talking about?
[58:10.17]The wrong material was cut.
[58:11.55]What?
[58:14.01]I broke this?
[58:15.97]Oh, it's a wood saw.
[58:16.99]God damn it.
[58:35.95]City boy.
[58:40.84]You know why I... Okay, I don't know how to change a tire either.
[58:44.14]Very, very important thing to know.
[58:46.86]Because I could know and I could learn, but I know I would screw it up.
[58:52.72]I would screw it up.
[58:54.09]And my fear of knowing that when I put that tire on, I'm going to get back on the fucking highway and my car is going to flip over like GTA.
[59:03.21]No.
[59:04.01]Somebody that knows what they're doing has to do that.
[59:05.51]Not me.
[59:07.51]I just have this crazy fear.
[59:09.01]Oh, yeah, man.
[59:10.39]No, you're fine.
[59:10.99]Just pop the hood and unconnect this and then take that out and put this back in.
[59:15.91]My car is going to explode if I do it.
[59:18.34]I will put everything and I'll follow the YouTube tutorial instructions or whatever, and I'll be like, OK, pause the video.
[59:23.96]Rewind 10 seconds.
[59:25.14]Watch it again to make sure I'm doing exactly what that guy just did verbatim with his hands.
[59:29.72]OK, done.
[59:31.34]When I close the lid to the engine, the car is going to explode the second that it latches the front.
[59:37.28]I can't.
[59:37.80]I just can't do it.
[59:38.38]I'm too afraid of it.
[59:43.56]Change a tire on stream.
[59:44.92]I wouldn't be able to.
[59:49.47]YouTube University?
[59:54.43]No, you don't pop the hood to change the tire.
[59:56.03]I'm just saying, like, in general, mechanical stuff like that, I'm terrified of.
[60:01.52]It's not hard to change a tire?
[60:02.80]I know, it doesn't matter.
[60:06.65]oh yeah you pop the trunk pop pop the uh the hood to get into the tire yeah I'm telling you I'm gonna have the wrench in my hand I'm gonna be sitting there like alright pop the tub pop the uh pop the top of it yeah
[60:22.40]Looks like, yeah, that screw's loose in there.
[60:24.22]Yeah, kill the engine, man.
[60:25.56]Kill the engine.
[60:26.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[60:27.16]Alright, let me get in there.
[60:28.60]And I'm going to get in there.
[60:29.40]I'm going to put the wrench around the nut or whatever.
[60:32.75]And I'm going to go.
[60:35.45]And I'm going to wake up in front of the pearly gates.
[60:38.33]It's going to be like, yeah, man, I'm good to go.
[60:40.67]Yeah, no, this looks good.
[60:41.63]I think this is correct.
[60:43.39]I'm awake.
[60:44.85]Something killed me.
[60:46.33]I just wake up at the pearly gates.
[60:49.74]And fucking Peter's gonna be like, wow, man, you don't even know how to change a tire?
[60:52.60]He just fires me down to hell.
[60:58.18]I look over and I see over like the pearly gates, I see like all the mechanics.
[61:02.22]They're all sitting there and they're all like, yeah, waving to me.
[61:05.76]It's just like a shitload of mechanics and like electricians.
[61:15.34]What do I need?
[61:19.67]Peter Griffin is... Dead because bad.
[61:27.76]Wait, but hold on.
[61:28.54]Doesn't being, like, Sekiro on stream means I get to go to heaven?
[61:32.44]Isn't that the same logic?
[61:37.38]Hold on.
[61:38.16]Why are we tying... Hold on.
[61:40.12]Why am I tying, like, professional skill to you go to heaven?
[61:44.34]That doesn't make any sense.
[61:47.50]These guys were all car mechanics.
[61:50.01]If you're not a car mechanic, you go to fucking hell?
[61:53.75]What am I talking about?
[61:54.73]That doesn't make any sense.
[62:00.97]This game must be pretty boring for you to talk about this.
[62:06.11]Playing video games with a skill is not worthy of heaven.
[62:10.11]Hey!
[62:12.62]All dogs go to heaven.
[62:14.36]Some dogs go to hell.
[62:18.15]Can you imagine that as a sequel?
[62:26.38]Oh, Disney presents Some Dogs Go to Hell.
[62:30.71]Rated PG.
[62:38.29]There is a sequel.
[62:39.07]What?
[62:43.00]Do I even have this thing?
[62:44.20]No, I don't.
[62:48.59]What was the name?
[62:50.34]Was it All Dogs Go to Heaven 2?
[62:53.70]Colon, Some Dogs Go to Hell?
[63:06.23]Where... Okay, I need the saw blade.
[63:08.27]I'm good, I'm good.
[63:09.29]I'm on it.
[63:09.69]I'm back on it.
[63:10.07]Do I have enough screws to put this on?
[63:20.35]Okay.
[63:20.79]Let's get back to this, please.
[63:25.55]He thinks he's so funny.
[63:29.03]No, I think that was funny.
[63:30.27]I don't think everything I say is funny.
[63:32.39]I think that was genuinely humorous.
[63:36.65]Typo in the title, hee hee.
[63:38.10]You know what?
[63:38.50]Yeah, fuck that.
[63:39.12]That just sucks.
[63:40.42]We're getting rid of it.
[63:43.78]I'm changing to some dogs go to hell.
[63:47.16]No, that's like weird out of context.
[63:49.00]Um.
[63:52.88]How about just, like, SCIENCE!
[64:09.39]Okay.
[64:11.21]I mean, it's only gonna be the title for, like, another 15 minutes, if I'm honest.
[64:13.72]Play something else.
[64:17.57]Why are you playing this and not Gloomwood?
[64:19.65]I don't know.
[64:20.69]I'll play Gloomwood eventually.
[64:23.11]Is it out?
[64:23.41]I thought it wasn't out yet.
[64:24.07]Oh, it came out in early access, okay.
[64:42.94]There are three All Dogs Go to Heaven movies?
[64:57.26]How many of these do I need?
[65:01.90]How many of these do I need?
[65:05.12]All Dogs Go to Heaven.
[65:06.19]Hold on, wait.
[65:06.95]There's three movies?
[65:09.77]All Dogs Go to Heaven, the series.
[65:11.39]Friends to the Rescue.
[65:14.13]And All Dogs Christmas Carol.
[65:16.05]All Dogs Go to Heaven 2.
[65:24.27]What's the main character's name?
[65:25.57]The dog from All Dogs Go to Heaven?
[65:33.56]Charlie?
[65:35.57]All dogs go to heaven three.
[65:37.69]Charlie's Inferno.
[65:52.40]Why is there a countdown?
[66:00.60]Okay, so now I need...
[66:04.10]I have steel rod pieces.
[66:05.10]Let's put Buster's head together.
[66:09.56]Buster, here we go.
[66:25.47]Press F, dude, please.
[66:27.25]What?
[66:29.83]I just did.
[66:30.13]What do you mean?
[66:30.85]What's wrong?
[66:44.75]This feels weird.
[66:45.71]Something about this just feels weird.
[66:53.37]Like, somehow wrong.
[66:54.43]How do I make this?
[66:58.43]Um, okay.
[67:00.27]I need to make the head with the... No, I need to make ballistic goo.
[67:05.29]Okay, ballistic gel head.
[67:06.46]I need... Okay, I need ballistic goo.
[67:07.92]I need... What is it?
[67:12.42]It's not cement.
[67:13.10]Pork?
[67:13.78]Whatever it is.
[67:17.82]I don't know how much this... I don't know.
[67:18.84]I'm just gonna get it, though.
[67:20.04]Water tank?
[67:25.68]I need a few of these.
[67:26.40]Okay, um... Is it a ballistic?
[67:32.93]Buster's torso, but is it ballistic torso?
[67:36.71]Am I missing that?
[67:52.50]Help!
[67:56.42]Oh, there's already one here.
[67:57.12]Alright.
[67:57.68]Um... No bottle to fill.
[68:04.21]Here we go.
[68:06.27]Okay, 20%.
[68:06.85]90%.
[68:08.65]Is Buster already made?
[68:18.18]What happened?
[68:18.68]Okay.
[68:24.22]20%.
[68:24.62]That's it, right?
[68:33.26]20 and... What's going on?
[68:40.01]How do I get it?
[68:44.81]It's gonna blow.
[68:47.87]Just take it?
[68:51.36]unknown substance added to backpack that how does this make any sense what am I doing wrong
[69:17.65]It's 20% and 80%, or 10% and 90%, right?
[69:19.08]10%, 90%?
[69:19.12]How am I doing this wrong?
[70:26.15]I did stop it at 100, it didn't do anything!
[70:33.69]1d percent!
[70:42.11]I can't- if I go any more further it's gonna explode!
[70:44.37]Ballistic gel.
[70:55.12]Okay, I need polypolyline granules or ballistic gel.
[71:01.04]That's what I'm trying to make right now.
[71:05.96]Ballistic gel.
[71:06.68]I'm trying to make ballistic gel right now.
[71:08.12]Okay.
[71:08.22]10 to 20% gelatin, 80, 90%.
[71:12.64]How is this wrong?
[71:27.33]Potion of helium?
[71:28.41]Is this Harry Potter?
[71:29.39]A portion of helium.
[71:36.23]Okay.
[71:37.09]Ballistic gel is... I'm gonna do 15%.
[71:42.40]That's 15% right there.
[71:44.12]Right in the middle.
[71:44.68]And I'm gonna do 85%.
[71:54.36]I... Help me.
[71:55.90]What's happening?
[72:00.80]15%?
[72:00.82]85%.
[72:00.84]Science is magic.
[72:05.39]That's not 85%.
[72:06.33]Yes, it is.
[72:11.65]Take the bottle now.
[72:12.53]It doesn't know what it... Alright.
[72:18.60]Alright, I've had it.
[72:32.26]15 plus 85 is 100.
[72:33.06]Okay, I'm doing... 10?
[72:46.05]10 and 90.
[72:48.19]10 and 90%.
[72:48.63]It has to be correct.
[72:52.23]Didn't you want all classes to be science?
[72:57.13]I actually don't know what's happening.
[72:58.45]Neither do I.
[73:00.91]Imagine how gross it is if you get splashed with pork, gelatin, and water.
[73:05.19]Yeah, this keeps hitting me right in the face.
[73:07.07]Okay, here we go.
[73:09.77]I'm gonna do 10 and 90.
[73:10.91]Should I do 20?
[73:31.12]What?
[73:34.01]10 plus 80 is 90.
[73:38.19]Put the water in first.
[73:45.74]What am I doing wrong?
[73:47.28]Water first.
[73:50.58]I'm going to do 80%.
[73:53.64]80% water.
[73:55.52]Now gelatin.
[73:56.26]I'm going to get kicked out of this place.
[74:05.14]10 and 80.
[74:05.66]Don't fill the whole way.
[74:16.76]Dude, this is genuinely worse than the clock.
[74:19.84]What?
[74:22.36]How is this worse than the clock?
[74:23.58]I'm doing what it says I'm supposed to be doing.
[74:26.56]There's your 10 and 80%.
[74:27.96]It doesn't work.
[74:29.22]Look.
[74:29.46]15 gelatin.
[74:37.54]And then water up to 90?
[74:38.96]Bro, none of your hypothesis works!
[74:44.73]10 plus 70.
[75:09.08]Hey, I got a hypothesis.
[75:10.42]Flip the recipe.
[75:11.18]How does that sound?
[75:11.80]Didn't work.
[75:27.65]Is that pork?
[75:28.35]Yeah, it's pork gelatin.
[75:34.61]These jello shots suck.
[75:40.95]Yeah, I made jello shots with bone broth.
[75:44.35]And vodka.
[75:45.89]First one to puke loses.
[75:50.08]Um... Does anyone understand what's going on?
[75:52.12]Because I think we've tried every combination.
[75:53.84]Is this the wrong gelatin?
[75:57.08]Pork gelatin and water.
[76:01.16]This is pork gelatin down here.
[76:02.84]Take the bottle off before it explodes.
[76:05.42]Holy shit, I already did that!
[76:09.01]Why?
[76:09.45]What is...
[76:23.54]unknown substance oh my god how much bullshit is in here please tell me he's pretending um alright
[76:45.62]I am gonna hover over gelatin and I want everyone to scream the stop sign when they want me to stop.
[76:52.21]I'm gonna do it very slow.
[77:02.82]Yeah.
[77:03.36]Yeah, fuck that.
[77:04.00]Look at all these people saying this shit.
[77:15.68]I don't get it!
[77:16.46]Oh my god, I'm screaming!
[77:18.70]Okay, how about this?
[77:25.59]This is, like, 15%, 80, like, this is correct!
[77:31.95]That's correct!
[77:35.35]This is correct.
[77:43.82]More water.
[77:45.12]More water, more water.
[77:46.26]No, no, no, no, no.
[77:46.96]A bit more water.
[77:51.63]It's not there.
[77:52.49]The white circle is the gelatin combined.
[77:57.63]Yeah, I know.
[77:58.07]80 to 90% water.
[78:02.19]That is legitimately what we are looking at right now.
[78:08.53]This is legitimately, legitimately what we're looking at.
[78:11.13]He's definitely not sober.
[78:12.33]Yes, I am.
[78:28.76]Why do I have four of these?
[78:34.12]What didn't it say?
[78:55.88]Now I got a clay mass.
[79:01.84]Wait, so I need to make a bunch of clay?
[79:03.36]I need clay and water.
[79:05.86]Alright, so I need clay.
[79:09.13]This is a pain in the ass.
[79:13.95]Why is there salami?
[79:15.31]Can I make salami water?
[79:17.71]Worst gamer moment.
[79:18.93]That, no, it was not.
[79:20.51]That's horse shit if you say that.
[79:23.08]Actual horse shit, don't say that.
[79:24.43]I tried it like five different ways.
[79:25.97]Okay, here we go.
[79:35.23]What's the combination?
[79:35.99]20-50% clay, 20-50% water.
[79:37.38]Alright, we're just going half and half.
[79:38.74]Okay.
[79:53.39]Here we go again.
[79:54.27]40 and 40.
[79:56.09]That's perfect, yeah.
[79:59.96]That's... that's it.
[80:05.70]40... 40 and 40.
[80:07.17]That's it.
[80:07.93]It's done.
[80:11.55]See?
[80:14.37]See, a lot of you guys got that wrong, apparently.
[80:24.39]Yeah, you apparently got that wrong.
[80:26.37]Okay, I got the clay.
[80:27.27]Now I need helium.
[80:29.65]Should I just make more?
[80:30.33]I'm gonna make one more.
[80:31.93]Probably need it.
[80:40.79]Alright, now I need to... Let's see if I can put this together.
[80:43.06]I gotta put the... In here, right?
[80:49.04]Um... Where's the head?
[80:50.18]This is the torso, right?
[80:54.09]Okay.
[80:54.73]Ballistic torso.
[80:56.87]Uh, okay, so... Okay.
[81:02.83]We need ballistic... What else?
[81:05.13]Ballistic feet?
[81:06.77]Oh my god, it takes so much of this stupid-ass gel.
[81:13.12]I need to make more?
[81:14.40]I need to make way more, then.
[81:15.48]Okay.
[81:26.07]Alright, throw this away.
[81:31.79]Gelatin.
[81:32.87]Water's fine.
[81:33.89]What was it again?
[81:34.43]15 and... I need more bottles.
[81:43.32]Why are you wasting so much stuff?
[81:46.02]Um, because it's not real.
[81:47.08]Ooh, balloons!
[81:54.73]Balloons!
[81:58.98]20 balloons is 630 fucking dollars.
[82:00.88]What are you talking about?
[82:01.73]Oh, right.
[82:14.81]Okay.
[82:20.42]Alright.
[82:21.46]Let's get it.
[82:21.92]This is 15%. 80%.
[82:30.97]That should do it right there.
[82:35.95]I... What?
[82:37.97]What happened?
[82:39.95]What happened?
[82:40.31]15 and... What's going on?
[82:41.03]15... 80%.
[82:41.48]That's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80.
[83:03.12]Is that your real voice, yo?
[83:25.96]I'm just going to make a ton of them.
[83:29.09]This is worse than school.
[83:31.79]No, it isn't.
[83:33.37]No, it is not.
[83:40.81]Oh, also, a lot of you will be interested.
[83:43.56]I have to change my Dark Souls tier list.
[83:48.02]I have to change my Dark Souls, you know, what I find to be, what's the best Dark Souls?
[83:52.18]What's the best FromSoftware game?
[83:53.24]I have to change it.
[83:55.48]I played Dark Souls 3 recently.
[83:57.89]I was just kind of messing around on the couch.
[83:59.39]Like, why not?
[84:00.15]I'll play Dark Souls 3 for no reason.
[84:04.15]I don't like that game.
[84:09.17]I don't like that game.
[84:12.37]I don't like it.
[84:12.75]Demon's Souls is better.
[84:24.88]God, I knew it was gonna pop and it scared me!
[84:43.91]The skill issue?
[84:45.75]No, you know what I figured out about Dark Souls 3 that I didn't really pay attention to?
[84:51.26]Every area has just the annoying group of people that are firing projectiles at you from across the map.
[84:57.71]Think of all the areas in Dark Souls 3 and think of how many times you go, wow, this is really fucking annoying.
[85:01.81]Somebody's just firing missiles at me.
[85:03.33]What's up with that?
[85:06.45]What's up with that?
[85:17.82]Hey, guess what?
[85:18.32]Bloodborne's a perfect game.
[85:20.02]Besides the fact that it's 30 FPS and it's only on PlayStation.
[85:25.16]Why won't they just release it, for the love of God?
[85:33.86]You know, Sony could probably say, oh, we're increasing the price of Bloodborne Remastered to $100.
[85:41.00]And we'd all still buy it, right?
[85:44.04]Like, I would buy it.
[85:46.40]A lot of you would buy it.
[85:50.03]I mean, it would be bullshit.
[85:51.52]It would be absolute horseshit, but we would.
[86:02.34]Rich Andy.
[86:03.29]I would hate it.
[86:13.35]Whatever, I have enough.
[86:19.16]Do I need two of these?
[86:25.10]It has shit graphics?
[86:25.86]Well, that's what I mean, a remaster.
[86:26.88]It didn't have shit graphics.
[86:29.65]It's just older.
[86:31.51]Like, almost 10 years old.
[86:36.17]You're enabling the company to do that in the future.
[86:37.89]Yeah, that's true.
[86:38.57]Never mind.
[86:42.08]Bloodborne sucks.
[86:44.80]It doesn't.
[86:45.44]I played literally Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 back-to-back.
[86:47.82]Just messing around.
[86:52.46]Polly had never played Bloodborne before.
[86:54.50]So it was like, holy shit, this is amazing.
[86:55.96]Alright, when somebody has not played a FromSoftware game and you know they haven't and they're into the series, that's like bringing, that's like your friend and you go watch all the Marvel movies back to back and they've never seen it.
[87:07.93]Or like the Lord of the Rings movies.
[87:10.03]It's just like, I can't wait to watch you watch Lord of the Rings.
[87:13.65]Right?
[87:13.81]Let's start again.
[87:20.43]I don't need to make three of these.
[87:23.85]No, Marvel was a bad... Okay, yeah.
[87:26.33]Sure, Marvel was a bad example.
[87:35.26]I would have said the same thing about Game of Thrones.
[87:37.48]But after, like, Season 5 or 6 of Game of Thrones, it was kind of just like, uh, no, don't watch it.
[87:44.92]I remember people being like, oh, man, Game of Thrones Season 7 and Season 8 are coming out.
[87:49.02]Should I start?
[87:49.86]Oh, I should definitely start.
[87:50.76]Should I watch it?
[87:51.48]And I'm just like, well...
[87:54.34]Yeah.
[87:56.02]Yeah.
[87:57.34]Yeah.
[88:00.60]I mean, it's great.
[88:01.65]It's a great series.
[88:02.63]Oh, I can't wait to see what happens.
[88:05.83]Yeah, I know.
[88:06.75]Me too.
[88:08.09]Me too.
[88:10.69]And they're like, what are you talking about?
[88:11.79]Ah, you know.
[88:24.80]When was the last time you watched the Varus scene?
[88:27.01]Oh my god.
[88:27.65]That's right.
[88:32.79]It's been a while.
[88:37.11]Ugh.
[88:45.27]Did I not make any other... What did I make?
[88:51.67]How many... I have to make so much of this?
[89:00.63]So I made... I didn't make any arms?
[89:09.13]This is good enough though, I think.
[89:14.33]I think this is fine.
[89:16.92]Do we really need to make... Oh no, I made the torso.
[89:18.54]Okay.
[89:22.60]Okay.
[89:27.39]So I need legs?
[89:29.85]Where's that?
[89:30.99]What is this?
[89:31.47]I think this is a leg, right?
[89:34.33]Yeah, I need two of these.
[89:42.81]But, yeah.
[89:44.24]Game of Thrones.
[89:46.02]Eh, we'll see.
[89:52.07]Wait, isn't there... I said Lord of the Rings.
[89:54.75]Doesn't Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones both have new shit that's available to watch right now?
[90:00.22]Is it worth it?
[90:01.10]Should I watch it?
[90:07.94]Is it alright?
[90:08.94]No, they suck.
[90:10.80]Do they?
[90:11.28]I don't know.
[90:11.58]Do they?
[90:11.84]I think I can make four of these.
[90:22.46]I haven't heard great things about it.
[90:25.86]I like Rings of Power.
[90:30.02]Rings of Power is good?
[90:31.12]Okay.
[90:31.84]The Lord of the Rings one is good.
[90:37.53]They suck.
[90:38.05]Don't let the fanboys tell you otherwise.
[90:41.01]I mean, I don't know.
[90:45.07]It's so difficult to do that, though.
[90:47.02]Honestly, at some point, it's like... Okay, Lord of the Rings.
[90:53.39]was a thing they made the hobbit series and people kind of said these are alright it's like after the these are alright and it was Peter Jackson that did that I I don't know I feel like it's hard to make anything else I don't know I could be wrong is it worse
[91:16.39]This guy's got so many... Okay, hold on.
[91:18.41]I need one, two, three, four.
[91:19.97]I need four more limbs and two hands.
[91:23.62]This is elaborate.
[91:33.10]House of the Dragon is the Hobbit of Game of Thrones.
[91:36.14]Okay.
[91:38.14]Okay.
[91:39.67]I actually didn't really hate the Hobbit movies that much.
[91:42.11]I thought they were a little stretched out and a little weird.
[91:46.65]Some of the CG in the Hobbit movies was kind of odd.
[91:51.17]I remember there was one in particular that was, uh... There was a lot of CG that kind of just felt strange in those movies.
[91:57.31]It was like really... Yeah, it was weird.
[92:00.46]I need to make more of that fluid.
[92:08.08]House of the Dragon is actually good.
[92:09.54]This is pretty divided then.
[92:11.14]I need more pork.
[92:15.00]Is there pork in here?
[92:18.58]Because they filmed it at 48 instead of 24 FPS.
[92:21.12]Yeah, it's something like that, right?
[92:36.86]Give it time.
[92:39.90]I am absolutely not dogging the show.
[92:47.59]Settle down, it's fine.
[92:53.60]Would you sell your soul for infinite money?
[92:55.48]No.
[92:55.66]There's only so much you can buy with money.
[93:00.00]Before, it's just like, what the fuck else do you... What do you do now?
[93:01.79]You know what I mean?
[93:06.71]It's like, oh, dude, infinite money!
[93:08.19]Infinite money!
[93:09.25]Alright, so I could get a plane, a boat, and, like, five houses.
[93:14.08]Then it's not... What else?
[93:14.62]Okay, what else?
[93:19.70]Dude, you have infinite money.
[93:20.64]Alright, but can I rebuild every school in America?
[93:24.53]Can I spend it on other people?
[93:25.45]Because that might be worth it.
[93:29.77]If I sold my soul for infinite money, and I literally fixed every problem in the world, and then I would just be essentially the one that had to get sacrificed, I mean, that... Alright.
[93:39.85]Do I get to have a cool life for, like, the next 40 or 50 years?
[94:02.69]Uh, two more, right?
[94:08.25]I mean, if I had infinite money, I would... I don't know, I'd... I'd go all out.
[94:13.40]I'd go baller mode on myself, right?
[94:17.94]For like, okay, for like five years, you would not hear from me at all, ever.
[94:22.36]I would just disappear and do a bunch of crazy shit as like a billionaire.
[94:26.02]And then I would come back, and I'd look at bags under my eyes, be like, alright, I should...
[94:32.05]It's time to fix this shit!
[94:34.71]And I would rebuild every school in America.
[94:35.93]I'd make- I'd plant like fucking hundreds of miles worth of crops.
[94:39.47]I would redo our entire education system.
[94:42.12]Okay, at that point I'm back and I'm ready to go.
[94:46.42]But I get a few years where I'm just gonna just fuck off and just, I don't know, live on an island and eat like coconuts and shit.
[94:52.85]And have like 5G internet on the island.
[94:59.07]Just give me, give me like five years for me just to like be a fucking nutcase.
[95:05.25]And then I'm back.
[95:08.33]With like a golden suit and a golden top hat and a golden cane.
[95:13.80]Who am I kidding?
[95:14.26]I'd be dead.
[95:14.82]Are you serious?
[95:17.54]I would have, I'd be dead.
[95:24.62]Oh, dude, what would you do with infinite money?
[95:27.70]Well...
[95:30.10]I would like Bungie jump in a gold suit and way too much and snap the thing and die.
[95:36.67]I mean, I'm being honest.
[95:44.96]We just get assassinated.
[95:46.96]But hold on.
[95:55.07]But what happened?
[95:56.37]Wait.
[95:58.33]But what about the money?
[95:59.25]Is it okay?
[96:00.43]We got to clarify a few things here.
[96:02.41]Is it a genie scenario where I have to, I have to essentially be alive, right?
[96:07.67]Like it's me.
[96:09.03]And if I'm not around, I can't just like go like this and wave the gold cane around.
[96:12.42]So, so it's the devil.
[96:15.86]Is it the devil?
[96:16.56]Is it a genie?
[96:17.42]Is it a, how am I coming?
[96:19.52]What's my motivation?
[96:20.50]Give me some direction here.
[96:24.28]You'd get kidnapped.
[96:26.04]But that's my point.
[96:28.96]Listen, do I have to be like, oh, great powerful sorcerer, I would like $100 to pay for my bar tab.
[96:38.11]How does this work?
[96:40.87]We need some context.
[96:51.34]It's just a credit card with no limit and you don't ever have to pay it back.
[96:55.92]Okay, but do I have to swipe it?
[96:57.48]Or can somebody take my infinite credit card thing and use it?
[97:01.10]Because then, yeah, I am making it 24 hours.
[97:08.16]Okay.
[97:09.10]Oh, breaking news.
[97:09.98]It seems that this man, Jeremy Elbertson from Las Vegas, Nevada, has in his possession, crazy enough, an infinite money credit card.
[97:18.97]Anyone who possesses this card can purchase anything in an infinite amount with no repercussions.
[97:25.14]I would go to the grocery store and there'd be a million people waiting for me.
[97:31.34]No.
[97:33.08]No, I don't want that thing.
[97:38.72]It's a golden McDonald's card.
[97:49.66]No, yeah, no fucking way.
[97:50.86]No thanks.
[98:01.06]But if I really had infinite money, yeah, I would just disappear.
[98:04.52]I'd go on a five-year bender.
[98:07.54]And that's not what you guys think it is.
[98:09.56]You know what I mean?
[98:13.65]That's getting wicked high on the couch for like a week or two straight sometimes, watching like tool videos, right?
[98:22.94]You know what I mean?
[98:23.60]It's not what you think it is.
[98:31.38]Where's the hands?
[98:43.11]It's clearly exactly what I think it is.
[98:52.07]No, no, tool, like actual tool videos.
[98:55.39]I'm not going to be sitting there just high.
[98:58.37]Just like... Just being like... I know the pieces of it because I watch it.
[99:02.80]I'm just sitting there like... I'm putting it on a loop.
[99:06.88]I'm talking... Well, I mean, I may watch a few of those.
[99:25.73]It wouldn't be the only thing I did.
[99:36.36]It's taking me like 40 minutes to make this.
[99:47.67]OK.
[99:49.61]Now we just have to hammer.
[99:50.69]Oh.
[99:55.52]It's a hammer.
[99:58.79]What?
[100:00.51]Oh, come on.
[100:12.02]What about a McDonald's Life Pass?
[100:15.16]What if someone offered you a McDonald's Life Pass, but to get it for one year, you have to eat McDonald's every day and nothing else?
[100:20.88]No.
[100:21.62]Why would I do that?
[100:25.93]That's not... That's not... No, thanks.
[100:35.04]How much is a McDonald's meal?
[100:37.68]Okay, if I had to eat three meals at McDonald's a day, that would be... What's like a number one or number two?
[100:46.27]10, 15 bucks?
[100:48.69]Like 20 bucks maybe?
[100:49.77]Like $16 maybe?
[100:51.31]For like two meals or something?
[100:52.93]Hmm.
[100:54.76]Alright, so let's just say it's $30 a day.
[100:57.04]So you're telling me, so this is effectively what you are saying.
[101:00.26]And this is why it's not worth it.
[101:02.70]So $30 a day turns into 30 times 7, right?
[101:06.81]So that's $210 a week times 4.
[101:09.33]That's $840 a month times 12.
[101:19.30]So you are giving me effectively $10,000 to eat McDonald's every single day.
[101:25.85]No, that's not even close to being enough money.
[101:29.95]That's $10,000 for a year's worth of McDonald's.
[101:32.33]No, you add two zeros to that.
[101:35.19]I ain't eating McDonald's every single day for a year for 10 grand worth of McDonald's.
[101:39.40]No way.
[101:40.12]Are you kidding me?
[101:43.08]Make that 10 million.
[101:44.30]Make that a million, then I'll do it.
[101:50.31]No, actually, I wouldn't.
[101:51.11]So I wouldn't.
[101:53.43]I would not eat McDonald's every day for a year for a million dollars.
[101:56.37]If you have to just die.
[102:00.36]Wasn't okay.
[102:01.08]Well, supersize me was like 30 days.
[102:04.28]Imagine if supersize me.
[102:05.36]He was like, Yeah, I'm gonna eat McDonald's three meals a day every single day for a year.
[102:09.64]I think I don't know if he would he be alive.
[102:17.01]Every day.
[102:22.42]Who is he talking to?
[102:23.56]You!
[102:24.30]Of course!
[102:24.74]Who do you think I'm talking to?
[102:33.16]And don't get me wrong, McDonald's is one of my favorite places on Earth.
[102:37.28]And I genuinely mean that.
[102:38.86]I love that place.
[102:42.20]I wouldn't want to eat it every single day.
[102:43.50]I wouldn't want to eat ice cream every day either.
[102:48.02]Too much of a good thing kind of sucks.
[102:55.18]Alright, what do I do with this?
[103:03.20]Would you eat ice cream every single day for 10 grand?
[103:06.35]You have to eat it, like, twice a day?
[103:12.99]Would you, though?
[103:14.05]No, you wouldn't.
[103:15.07]After, like, a month or two, you'd be like, I feel sick every day.
[103:20.76]And we're talking full-fat ice cream.
[103:22.56]None of this... None of this, like, oat milk ice cream.
[103:25.19]None of this, like, lactose-free ice cream.
[103:27.05]We're talking ice cream ice cream.
[103:28.71]Milk, fat, whole milk, cream ice cream.
[103:32.39]You have to eat it three times a day.
[103:33.73]Wait, didn't I already do this?
[103:47.08]Ballast in the... What is a... What is a ballast?
[103:53.54]Oh, clay mass and a Jerry can.
[103:57.25]Alright, so I need more clay.
[103:59.45]Clay mass?
[104:02.21]Wait, this is pork in here.
[104:06.89]What's going on?
[104:07.39]Okay.
[104:16.14]Clay and it's just the same thing I was doing before.
[104:23.74]If they paid for the ice cream, then yes.
[104:27.96]I feel like it would be the same thing as McDonald's.
[104:30.28]It would be too much.
[104:37.18]How are you busting myths right now?
[104:39.81]That's actually a really good question.
[104:46.33]Yeah, what myth am I busting?
[104:49.23]Oh, right.
[104:49.87]See if you fly away with balloons.
[104:52.15]That's what it was.
[104:55.52]What would your brand of ice cream be?
[104:57.31]Wait, if I had ice cream?
[104:58.67]Like an ice cream... Oh, shit.
[105:04.33]What would my ice cream flavor be if I were to have an ice cream?
[105:13.94]Shut up.
[105:18.22]It'd be a chocolate ice cream.
[105:23.81]And they would be gobs of cookie dough in, and I'm talking a smooth chocolate ice cream, not this like, not like the kind of cocoa dark kind of chocolate.
[105:32.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[105:33.07]Smooth milk chocolate ice cream with marshmallow swirls.
[105:38.82]Swirls of, like a marshmallow fluff, like swirls in it.
[105:47.78]Cookie dough.
[105:58.33]Not chocolate chips.
[105:59.03]They're annoying.
[106:04.93]And like cookie crumbles.
[106:07.20]Soft cookie crumbles.
[106:08.32]Wait, that's cookie dough.
[106:09.86]Alright, take out the cookie dough and add like soft cookie, chocolate chip cookie crumbles.
[106:15.04]Soft, chewy.
[106:21.68]And graham crackers.
[106:24.94]And it would be called the fat fuck.
[106:45.39]$120 for a chair?
[106:46.37]Wait, this exists?
[106:49.87]It's called Cookie Cobblestone?
[106:52.03]Oh, no, it already exists.
[106:57.21]Cookie Cobblestone.
[107:00.05]What?
[107:00.43]I need this.
[107:02.22]Where do I get this?
[107:04.70]Look at this.
[107:06.74]This is called Cookie Cobblestone.
[107:19.07]Where is it?
[107:22.87]Check this out.
[107:28.70]Okay.
[107:30.36]Let me see.
[107:30.80]Chocolate ice cream, cookie dough, marshmallow swirls, and crushed cookie pieces.
[107:37.18]How come they stole this from me?
[107:42.34]This is amazing.
[107:43.18]I want this right now.
[107:44.10]This is Rocky.
[107:44.72]That was on Rocky Road.
[107:45.54]I know what Rocky Road tastes like.
[107:50.03]They must've made this like 10 minutes ago.
[107:52.91]They must've just made this.
[107:58.06]Okay.
[107:58.32]Cookie cobblestone.
[107:59.18]That's my, that's my jam right there.
[108:02.50]I want this.
[108:04.76]Is this something like, it was back in like 2002.
[108:07.10]It doesn't exist anymore.
[108:14.16]That looks damn good.
[108:15.30]Nice job, Eddies.
[108:16.74]Seriously.
[108:18.58]We connect on stuff, you and I. Eddies, you and I get it.
[108:25.30]I mean, some of the world's best ice cream.
[108:27.23]Since, you know, since 1928.
[108:28.19]I'm just saying.
[108:32.25]I mean, it's one of the world's most tastiest ice creams.
[108:42.91]Why am I buying bullets?
[108:49.14]Why am I buying a gun?
[108:57.26]Stop fighting!
[108:57.86]Stop fighting your lip!
[109:00.26]You want that sponsor so bad?
[109:01.42]Hey, Eddie's.
[109:04.55]Got a couple of streams coming up.
[109:09.91]Why would anybody sponsor?
[109:11.65]Why would an ice cream company sponsor this stream?
[109:16.99]They would open up the stream for five minutes and go, nope.
[109:28.94]But, Eddie's.
[109:31.60]I'm available for a sponsor.
[109:36.83]Eddie's went out of business.
[109:39.95]What?
[109:41.84]No, it didn't.
[109:45.78]No, it didn't.
[109:46.60]Eddie's Ice Cream.
[109:47.42]What are you talking about?
[109:48.12]It exists.
[109:48.34]It exists.
[109:56.41]No, it's not.
[109:57.79]They have a tweet from 12 hours ago, guys.
[109:59.59]They're fine.
[110:04.71]How dare you fucking say that.
[110:07.44]I've actually had them before.
[110:09.04]You know what my favorite ice cream tier list?
[110:13.72]Ice cream from the grocery store tier list.
[110:16.56]That word tier.
[110:19.85]You know who I think makes the best in the grocery store ice cream?
[110:25.59]What do you think it is?
[110:32.52]What do you guys think?
[110:37.47]You got, you're close.
[110:38.51]Some of you guys are close.
[110:42.43]That's right.
[110:43.21]Blue Bunny.
[110:45.42]Blue Bunny makes the best grocery store ice cream, without a doubt.
[110:49.02]It's by a mile.
[110:49.66]I mean, it's by a, it's by a fucking mile.
[110:54.30]It's not even, it's, I'm not kidding.
[110:55.65]It's not even close.
[110:56.99]Um,
[110:59.50]Hold on.
[111:00.96]Don't even start.
[111:02.36]Yes, Ben and Jerry's does make the best ice cream, but Ben and Jerry's does not really have in the grocery store strawberry ice cream or just chocolate ice cream.
[111:13.65]It's like Jerry Lewis's Tonight Dough is a bunch of wacky shit, and it's amazing.
[111:20.29]But I'm talking just straight up chocolate ice cream or strawberry ice cream.
[111:26.76]It's, um... Blue Bunny makes the best.
[111:30.57]For anything else, it's Ben & Jerry's, so I know I've said that before.
[111:33.31]It is the best thing you can buy at the grocery store, hands down.
[111:38.10]Okay, so I think I'm ready to do this.
[111:39.48]I need a potion of helium at the pumping station.
[111:45.14]This has been a fine, chill game.
[111:46.44]We're just hanging out, having a good time!
[111:52.83]Blue bunny only makes novelties.
[111:54.17]No, they don't.
[111:54.65]I have, I literally have blue bunny chocolate ice cream.
[111:57.51]Just chocolate in my freezer right now.
[111:59.19]And I eat it all the time.
[112:02.70]Tillamook is better.
[112:03.36]Blue bunny is better.
[112:05.54]That's my opinion.
[112:07.78]You have to, you're making me prove this.
[112:09.06]Why would I prove that an ice cream?
[112:10.40]Just go look it up.
[112:10.94]Type Google blue bunny chocolate ice cream.
[112:13.64]I don't have to prove it to you.
[112:22.87]You don't have it.
[112:24.03]I have it.
[112:29.16]Okay.
[113:19.87]I don't know why I have to prove this to everybody.
[113:22.51]Why does this matter?
[113:23.29]Why do you have to know this?
[113:26.07]Okay.
[113:27.27]Here.
[113:30.45]Blue bunny.
[113:31.15]Chocolate.
[113:32.11]Chocolate ice cream.
[113:34.55]It's just the standard blue bunny chocolate ice cream.
[113:39.10]It's delicious.
[113:39.56]It's perfect.
[113:40.04]It's smooth.
[113:41.48]It's pillowy.
[113:44.26]When you scoop it out, it makes this like...
[113:52.08]It's fluffy, it's pillowy.
[114:24.23]I was anticipating to show you a smooth... this may have been in there for a while.
[114:30.72]This may... hold on.
[114:31.74]What is the expiration?
[114:36.56]Fuck.
[114:37.92]I fucked it up.
[114:38.84]I fucked it up.
[114:39.65]I fucked it up.
[114:40.31]I fucked it up.
[114:41.59]I fucked it up.
[115:14.72]No, it's not.
[115:15.56]It's freezer burn.
[115:16.83]My freezer's fucked up.
[115:18.29]That's my fault.
[115:20.31]That's my fault for showing that to you.
[115:22.77]That is not fresh.
[115:23.97]I had a freezer problem that I had to fuck up with my freezer settings and that's what did that.
[115:30.19]My freezer's screwed up.
[115:38.37]Okay.
[115:40.78]So we're good.
[115:47.75]Too cold?
[115:48.20]I don't know.
[115:52.69]I messed up something with my freezer.
[115:57.63]That looked like, no, it was, alright.
[116:00.12]Anyways, Blue Bunny is incredibly fluffy.
[116:03.44]It's smooth.
[116:05.78]It has an amazing texture.
[116:07.24]And I know I look really odd saying that to you right now.
[116:11.08]But it's true.
[116:12.28]It's got a pillowy texture.
[116:14.52]The mouthfeel is perfect.
[116:16.28]It like disintegrates in the back of your mouth.
[116:18.08]And it's perfect.
[116:19.12]It's the best ice cream you can buy.
[116:21.26]Look at what I just showed you.
[116:22.84]That was, I shouldn't have done that.
[116:24.86]I should have showed it to you when it was ready.
[116:28.47]Ah, play the game.
[116:30.37]You don't care about this game.
[116:32.65]I know you don't.
[116:35.36]Uh, what am I doing?
[116:36.00]Alright, water.
[116:46.78]Alright, so now I need helium.
[116:53.51]I need, where do I get helium?
[117:01.36]This looks like helium, right?
[117:02.76]Where would I get helium?
[117:07.51]Oh, here we go.
[117:12.92]By the way, I want to say this really clearly, too.
[117:14.98]Um...
[117:21.17]Strawberry ice cream?
[117:24.49]I like it with some strawberries in it.
[117:27.29]My favorite kind of strawberry ice cream is no chunks, just smooth strawberry flavor.
[117:34.06]How do I make this?
[117:40.43]Just 90 to 100% helium, that's it, okay.
[117:46.65]In a plastic bottle?
[117:51.93]I need ten of these?
[117:53.51]What?
[117:54.29]Why do I need so much shit?
[118:06.62]Oh, it's three for each one.
[118:07.56]I get it.
[118:13.08]Alright, it's time to start the experiment.
[118:17.70]Now I need a chair.
[118:26.04]page 11 oh my god okay get the right pieces for the chair frame um yeah I'm done after this we're gonna change games this is cool this is fine but I we gotta change this
[118:49.52]We're on experiment two.
[118:50.78]Yeah, but we paused and had, like, a stupid shitty podcast for at least, like, 40 minutes of this stream.
[118:56.18]Alright, um... So I need to do rectangular steel... Okay, wooden beam and wooden cylinder.
[119:02.71]Wooden beam and wooden cylinder.
[119:04.49]I gotta change the saw, too.
[119:11.49]Really?
[119:14.37]I would love a Jerma podcast.
[119:16.81]Um, I... I wouldn't.
[119:20.00]We already do it.
[119:21.21]I'm doing it right now.
[119:21.95]This is what we do.
[119:24.77]Half the streams are just that.
[119:27.11]Why would I do a podcast?
[119:28.75]We're just already doing it.
[119:34.87]Going on someone's podcast is fine.
[119:38.13]I think that's fun.
[119:38.83]But I feel like I wouldn't be able to do very much on my podcast.
[119:47.70]God damn it.
[119:48.24]This better be worth it.
[119:53.68]Can I cut?
[119:54.76]Wait, can I?
[119:55.30]Oh, it's the wrong one.
[120:00.68]A metal cutting saw can cut a wooden piece of furniture, okay?
[120:06.77]I'm sorry.
[120:12.31]Take it out.
[120:13.75]How do I unscrew this?
[120:18.75]Wrench.

[120:49.09]Okay.
[120:49.51]I need to buy it.
[121:02.43]Um, if people wanted to see it, I'd probably play it again.
[121:07.17]It was fun.
[121:11.53]You'd have to want it, right?
[121:12.57]You'd have to want to see it.
[121:13.31]What about Subnautica?
[121:21.40]Didn't I play Subnautica?
