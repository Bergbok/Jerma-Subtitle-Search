[ve:61.7.100]

[00:08.94]I am back.
[00:11.44]And I am ready to play some Armored Core.
[00:19.63]Somebody asked, is this your first Armored Core game?
[00:21.67]The answer is yes.
[00:24.73]And I know.
[00:26.01]Don't play it like Dark Souls.
[00:27.45]I know they made this game.
[00:28.83]Don't play it like Dark Souls.
[00:30.47]I know you're going to try.
[00:31.46]And you're going to get frustrated.
[00:33.24]I promise I will not.
[00:46.80]How does this look?
[00:48.32]So this is a controller game, right?
[00:52.47]Everything I've read that this is a controller game.
[00:56.19]I still want to beat Final Fantasy 16.
[00:57.77]I don't know what made me think of that.
[01:05.85]Oh no, my headphone plug is messed up.
[01:10.10]Okay.
[01:10.20]Okay.
[01:12.79]Keyboard is better.
[01:13.51]Controller.
[01:14.01]Controller.
[01:14.45]I don't know.
[01:15.71]Let's try it.
[01:23.09]Okay.
[01:23.85]Let me see.
[01:28.95]Can you see it?
[01:31.14]You should see it.
[01:33.98]Hey, there it is.
[01:40.92]I'm not playing online.
[01:41.88]I figured that's probably not.
[01:44.60]I usually don't play any of these games online.
[01:47.54]Alright, new game.
[01:50.94]That looks good.
[01:53.88]That's fine.
[01:54.52]Okay, that's fine.
[02:00.95]Pilot name.
[02:04.51]I want it to be a surprise.
[02:21.67]Okay, I'm going to make sure you don't see it because I want it to be a surprise.
[02:30.57]It's probably a cutscene.
[02:40.16]Have I got to like this game?
[02:51.31]Activating cerebral coral control device.
[02:54.77]Seen a lot of nose augmented human C4621 open mind open mind guys.
[03:08.22]Time to get to work 621.
[03:12.94]I'm powering down your entry capsule on my signal.
[03:24.77]More Sekiro than Souls.
[03:27.98]That's very loud.
[03:39.48]You are so fucked, dude.
[03:48.20]Yeah, I've heard all the people comparing stuff.
[03:51.14]This is what I've been told.
[03:52.94]This is a different video game.
[03:55.62]This is not a Souls game.
[04:00.57]So I'm going to treat it like a completely different video game.
[04:06.81]It's a completely different franchise.
[04:12.97]But does it have that FromSoftware crispiness that we're all used to?
[04:17.01]Let's find out.
[04:22.57]Descent to ISB 2262 Rubicon 3 complete.
[04:28.81]Your position is grid 135.
[04:31.29]OK.
[04:34.49]Off target but within permissible range.
[04:38.33]Looks really good.
[04:39.35]There's a catapult ahead.
[04:41.21]Use it to close the gap.
[04:48.63]Main system activating combat mode.
[04:51.84]OK.
[04:54.15]Commence mission.
[04:58.57]Yep, move.
[05:03.88]That feels fun to play.
[05:05.16]Okay, move is boost movement on.
[05:09.22]Okay, so it's a toggle.
[05:13.68]That's a jump, and you hold to go up.
[05:17.69]Okay.
[05:18.57]Some actions consume energy and are disabled when energy is depleted.
[05:23.65]Got it.
[05:26.65]How do I turn the... How do I turn the gas off?
[05:28.43]How do you turn the gas off?
[05:30.77]Okay.
[05:39.34]Automatically targets... This automatic targeting.
[05:42.20]When there are multiple enemies, the closest enemy to the center of the screen will be prioritized.
[05:47.61]Oh.
[05:53.09]What's wrong with my weapon?
[06:03.14]How do I reload?
[06:06.43]You gotta reload.
[06:07.23]Is there a manual reload?
[06:16.93]Okay, target assist keeps your AC oriented toward the target.
[06:20.02]When enabled, your AC will automatically lock its orientation towards enemies.
[06:23.34]Okay, so it's lock on.
[06:26.00]Yeah, lock on.
[06:26.74]Got it.
[06:28.68]You can still use the camera to change targets while in target assist mode.
[06:32.53]Hold on.
[06:34.55]So I can... Ah!
[06:41.67]I get it.
[06:47.31]Okay.
[06:47.97]Right shoulder weapon and left... The missile launcher equipped with the right shoulder is capable of multi-lock-on.
[06:57.33]Which allows you to attack multiple enemies simultaneously by holding down the input for that weapon.
[07:00.83]That was the weirdest time... That was a weird drink.
[07:09.02]Okay, so hold this.
[07:17.35]How many people can I grab at once?
[07:27.69]Whoa.
[07:28.31]Okay, that's a slash.
[07:31.88]There's four for this one.
[07:33.32]Okay.
[07:42.34]Do I have anything on left bumper?
[07:44.72]Repair kits to repair and recover armor points.
[07:47.75]Repair kits can be used up to three times per mission, but cannot be used in rapid succession.
[07:54.33]Your AC is taking damage.
[07:55.59]Okay.
[07:56.21]Patch it up.
[07:57.99]Two repair kits remaining.
[07:59.79]And shook Gideon off.
[08:04.84]See the contaminated city down there?
[08:07.30]That's where you're landing.
[08:08.24]What?
[08:10.06]What is that?
[08:10.62]Access there.
[08:15.34]I just started moving.
[08:16.36]I kind of just started moving on its own.
[08:34.11]Roller coaster tracks.
[08:41.51]How can you emphasize certain words as if you're comprehending what you're reading?
[08:48.88]I'm sorry, I couldn't see what you wrote.
[08:50.88]You were banned.
[08:53.92]I can't read your message.
[08:55.74]Something with it.
[08:56.26]Okay.
[09:19.95]I get it so far.
[09:21.41]Quick boost.
[09:24.65]Instantly accelerate in any direction helping you to evade attacks or swiftly close in.
[09:29.99]X is a dash.
[10:13.83]Cool.
[10:14.25]I think a lot of people thought I was going to die there, so I win.
[10:22.13]It doesn't seem like there is a map.
[10:25.82]Use assault boost to move rapidly in the direction that the camera is facing.
[10:30.30]Or to rapidly approach targets.
[10:32.30]So you press in the left stick and then down is cancel it.
[10:35.74]Oh, that's what happened.
[10:36.96]OK, that's what happened last time.
[10:38.84]I was like, why am I moving automatically?
[10:52.81]Let's go.
[11:03.27]Alright.
[11:05.02]Gotta make it all the way over there.
[11:07.50]I've never played any of these games before.
[11:08.90]No, not as of until right now.
[11:41.93]It's fun.
[11:47.45]Okay.
[11:48.72]There's no timer or anything, right?
[11:50.00]No, there's not.
[11:51.88]He did play Metal Wolf.
[11:52.84]I did play Metal Wolf.
[11:56.32]It's true.
[12:00.96]What's the range on this?
[12:14.24]Oh shit, I'm out of gas.
[12:24.65]How do I turn the gas off?
[12:37.67]Turn the gas, it's B. OK, yep.
[12:45.52]That's my favorite move so far.
[12:46.56]I like that one a lot.
[13:02.69]The normal boost does not drain energy.
[13:04.67]That's good to know.
[13:06.91]Okay, license code Monkey Gordo.
[13:09.88]License code extracted from an AC wreck in the contaminated city.
[13:13.00]Contains the pilot's registration data.
[13:16.40]So this is essentially a fast travel.
[13:42.20]No, it's a salt boost.
[13:44.58]Right, right.
[13:45.14]But you know what I mean.
[13:52.26]Does everything reload automatically?
[14:02.11]Yes.
[14:02.35]Alright, good.
[14:04.19]Is that all I needed to know?
[14:09.23]Alright, where are we at?
[14:11.39]Down there.
[14:11.95]You can also reload it faster.
[14:18.79]Ooh.
[14:25.46]You can manually reload the rifle.
[14:27.28]Okay.
[14:31.56]G7 Hakura.
[14:34.06]License expires in 12 hours.
[14:40.72]I like the flying.
[14:58.31]Last one.
[14:59.27]OK.
[15:07.08]License expired.
[15:10.05]Somebody said you should use the B type control scheme.
[15:12.93]It's way better, is it?
[15:13.95]I feel like I could get used to this.
[15:30.22]It's just personal preference.
[15:31.16]What is it?
[15:31.56]What does it do?
[15:32.88]Type B.
[15:41.25]I'd be quick boost is right trigger.
[15:43.59]A is boost.
[15:46.51]Uh, A is, I think they're the same.
[15:49.16]Okay.
[15:50.34]No, I much prefer it like this.
[15:52.66]All the trigger buttons are weapons to me.
[15:57.68]Put the music volume up.
[16:03.87]There.
[16:04.99]Increase everything.
[16:10.58]Alright, where am I going?
[16:12.37]Just where?
[16:23.75]Can I upgrade that?
[16:24.62]That's the first thing I'm upgrading.
[16:25.58]I want that to last much longer.
[16:51.21]Oh shit, that's a bad idea.
[16:56.41]It's all about moving, moving, moving, moving, moving.
[17:03.37]30%?
[17:03.71]That's it?
[17:04.08]I didn't know that was ammo.
[17:20.89]Dermot, you're going to get filtered by this game so hard.
[17:23.55]What does that mean?
[17:26.01]I've not heard that term before.
[17:27.11]That's a new FromSoftware Armored Core 6 term that you're using.
[17:31.67]What is that?
[17:32.03]You're going to get filtered.
[17:45.52]What does that mean?
[17:49.28]Does that mean that I cannot... There's like a gamer filter on this game where... Like it filters out all the non-gamers.
[17:55.87]Because what if I can't beat the first boss and I get filtered?
[17:58.27]Is that what it means?
[18:10.30]Alright, well, I haven't even gotten through the tutorial yet.
[18:13.62]You guys are already... You guys are already saying things that are going to happen on this stream before they've even happened.
[18:20.74]You've already placed the bets already.
[18:22.34]I'm going to do just fine.
[18:28.14]Okay, vertical catapult.
[18:42.17]Yep.
[18:42.41]This game is harder than Elden Ring.
[18:58.17]I'm sure it probably is a different category.
[19:10.49]right here comes the first tutorial boss here we go I'm gonna get like filtered because I'm not good enough this is definitely a boss area look at it registration number rb23 does it make the FromSoftware bird noise though that's the main question does it
[19:52.93]That sounds like the TikTok filter.
[20:00.48]That sounds like the guy on TikTok.
[20:02.40]That's the TTS.
[20:23.51]At 10%.
[20:23.63]AP at 50%.
[20:23.93]We've got them now.
[20:26.11]They can come at 6-2-1.
[20:28.75]We got what we came for.
[20:32.49]Time to lose at 6-2-1.
[20:54.69]Oh, I got filtered.
[21:02.56]Okay, I get it.
[21:11.72]I get it.
[21:14.66]I'll get it this time.
[21:18.67]I got three heals now.
[21:28.61]Alright, here we go.
[21:30.21]It's all about getting up close.
[21:31.21]I got it.
[21:31.79]I got it.
[21:33.29]I got it.
[21:36.19]I got it.
[22:06.15]Oh, damn it.
[22:06.93]Sorry.
[22:07.15]Alright.
[22:22.37]Back it up.
[22:22.67]Back it up.
[22:22.93]Back it up.
[22:23.19]I'm alright.
[22:42.73]Whoa!
[22:43.78]I'm fine.
[23:51.20]Die!
[23:52.96]Got it.
[24:00.76]Second try, is that alright?
[24:03.58]Did I do good?
[24:06.29]Did I beat it?
[24:06.81]Okay, that was fun.
[24:09.13]Gamers are flipping their desks right now.
[24:11.09]Okay, this is a raven?
[24:35.01]That's your new name here on Rubicon.
[24:44.28]Yeah.
[24:44.70]Okay, so I could see how that would be really... That could be pretty difficult.
[24:50.18]You can die in one hit by those bombs if you don't avoid them.
[24:55.37]Cool.
[24:55.75]Okay.
[24:58.39]Chat losing to a retired streamer.
[25:04.80]Hey, just because I'm a little loaded doesn't mean I still got it sometimes.
[25:08.68]Okay, so I got 86,000 bucks.
[25:14.21]Coral, a sublime substance.
[25:17.53]That was enjoyable.
[25:18.41]I had a lot of fun doing that.
[25:19.55]A planet on the frontier of developed space.
[25:23.61]For a time, coral was a revolutionary energy resource and data conduit poised to transform human society by leaps and bounds.
[25:37.20]They called it the fires of Ibis.
[25:40.38]A storm of flame that tore through the stars.
[25:42.99]How come you sound so sarcastic?
[25:45.35]Do I?
[25:45.75]I don't know.
[25:46.21]I'm just kind of chilling.
[25:48.67]I don't mean to.
[25:49.31]It was thought to have been utterly consumed.
[25:52.53]Forever lost.
[25:56.47]However, on Rubicon, the embers continued to burn.
[26:03.34]Humanity would inevitably return.
[26:08.47]To stoke the fire.
[26:11.03]It's a little low alternative.
[26:20.15]The whole point of this game is you upgrade and change out here, right?
[26:23.65]Registration number RB 23.
[26:26.61]Call sign Raven authentication complete that I'm into that part for sure.
[26:31.92]Status restoring access privileges.
[26:37.93]You can paint it?
[26:38.75]Ooh.
[26:38.85]I took the idea.
[27:09.32]Don't get tied to one build.
[27:10.40]Always change it to adapt.
[27:11.12]Okay.
[27:11.26]Change the title?
[27:11.98]What is the title right now?
[27:14.40]Does this say I'm playing the duck game?
[27:40.28]Design.
[27:43.23]OK, design.
[27:45.97]Assembly.
[27:47.89]Oh boy, that's a lot of information.
[27:49.35]OK, customize AC assemblies using the parts you have available at the assembly menu.
[27:54.05]So that your build keeps within the maximum weight.
[27:56.15]OK.
[27:59.15]So this is, I like this weapon a lot.
[28:04.97]Attack power.
[28:07.13]Impact.
[28:11.19]head okay I don't think I can change this I can take it off I don't definitely don't want to take it off okay what about nothing I don't have anything for the back oh geez that's a lot
[28:35.84]I'm going to keep the I'm going to keep it simple for now, just because this is a lot of information that I don't really know what this means.
[28:45.86]I can read those numbers at the bottom.
[28:49.28]So we'll stick with that.
[28:55.35]OK.
[28:57.07]Paint.
[29:06.48]Okay, I could spend all day here.
[29:07.98]I'm just going to make his head just bright red.
[29:15.95]See, that means I'm angry.
[29:16.87]Okay.
[29:39.98]Okay, that looks good.
[29:49.56]Uh, that's fine.
[29:56.03]Decals.
[29:56.83]Apply emblems in your possession and user-created images.
[29:59.69]Okay.
[30:02.41]What do I have for regular decals?
[30:05.77]So you can just deck yourself out in a bunch of memes.
[30:11.73]Okay, that's kind of fun.
[30:15.75]The spider.
[30:19.23]This is all for another time.
[30:23.19]Create images for use.
[30:25.23]Manage AC assembly appearance settings.
[30:28.63]Save and load.
[30:29.19]Okay, you can save each one.
[30:30.70]Okay, cool.
[30:34.32]What's sortie?
[30:36.84]Missions.
[30:37.60]Training.
[30:39.12]Missions.
[30:41.26]Check incoming jobs and sortie on missions from the missions menu.
[30:48.91]Okay.
[30:49.17]This is $100,000.
[30:49.89]This is $68,000.
[30:50.47]Should I just keep going?
[30:56.03]Destroy artillery installations.
[30:58.04]Do the training first.
[31:01.74]Beginner training.
[31:03.48]Okay.
[31:03.80]Training gives you free parts.
[31:04.84]Oh, okay.
[31:18.16]Land shots on moving enemies.
[31:19.20]You must pull the trigger while they are within lock-on range.
[31:22.09]Yep, that's what I was doing.
[31:22.99]I figured.
[31:26.37]They have to be in the range and they have to be in the circle.
[31:55.95]Okay.
[31:58.63]Here we are.
[31:59.28]Weapons with magazines will automatically reload when the magazine's ammunition is depleted.
[32:03.20]Manually reload before engaging the enemy to minimize the risk that your attacks will be interrupted by a reload.
[32:08.38]So that's Y plus RT.
[32:18.26]Okay, that's good.
[32:28.36]Missile lock.
[32:28.98]To use missiles in other homing rounds, keep the enemy on screen until the lock-on completes, then fire.
[32:34.26]Right.
[32:35.05]It goes... Some missile weapons are capable of multi-lock.
[32:39.51]Yep.
[32:41.77]Hold it to multi-lock.
[32:44.67]Oh, you can cancel it.
[32:46.81]That's actually good to know.
[32:53.02]Those all went over there.
[33:03.74]Very cool.
[33:10.11]Oops.
[33:11.69]Oops.
[33:15.53]Melee weapons.
[33:18.93]You can charge it.
[33:19.53]That's good to know.
[33:21.43]Okay.
[33:33.86]also noticed that there's a Sekiro-like shield system in the game.
[33:45.91]You gotta fill up that meter.
[33:47.97]I'm imagining some stuff does way more stagger damage than like the machine gun probably doesn't do very much stagger damage.
[33:58.50]Cool.
[34:02.11]So there's a Hitman 3 vision mode.
[34:04.99]Ooh.
[34:08.38]OK.
[34:23.90]Melee weapons do a lot of stagger.
[34:25.28]Feels like it.
[34:53.15]nice slashing twice did you only scan once yeah I I figured it out though okay the new machine gun ah alright so this weighs more less attack power but
[35:17.87]Excellent rapid fire output.
[35:19.59]Somewhat lacking in firepower.
[35:20.87]I could put it on the other arm.
[35:26.38]Oh, that's the blade.
[35:29.58]Wait, that weighs less.
[35:32.06]Oh, how come the bar is increasing?
[35:37.06]Oh, I see, I see.
[35:37.85]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[35:38.67]I get it.
[35:46.57]Should I?
[35:46.91]Is that better than...
[35:49.85]I'll try it.
[35:50.21]I have nothing else.
[36:01.47]Okay, is that it for the training?
[36:02.65]Let me try another mission.
[36:10.00]Okay, which one of these is a good mission for me to try?
[36:12.14]I'm imagining probably this one.
[36:14.46]This one's worth more.
[36:18.77]They both?
[36:19.69]They both just, okay.
[36:21.37]Let's go to this one.
[36:26.21]Got a job for you, 621.
[36:29.01]This is an open call from the Balem Group, one of the corporate forces occupying Rubicon.
[36:36.62]Attention, all independent mercenaries.
[36:39.34]New training appears eventually.
[36:41.00]Cool.
[36:43.72]Rubicon Liberation Front has deployed Baos artillery throughout the contaminated city.
[36:49.93]The city itself has no strategic value.
[36:52.49]We cannot allow them to hinder expansion of the Coral Survey.
[36:57.27]Show us your ambition.
[36:59.39]Destroy the Liberation Front's artillery.
[37:02.61]Bonus pay will be awarded for destroying their MTs.
[37:05.74]We want the enemy weakened.
[37:07.16]Consider it an opportunity to prove yourself.
[37:14.16]Impress us, mercenaries!
[37:17.74]I like in the middle of that.
[37:18.74]Bye, Jeremiah.
[37:19.44]I'm going to bed.
[37:22.05]Alright, have a good one.
[37:26.95]Alright, so I think I'm good.
[37:29.67]Destroy all Rubicon Liberation Front artillery installations.
[37:37.45]I think I'm just good.
[37:46.53]Client doesn't care who does this job.
[37:52.01]As long as it gets done.
[37:58.56]You get more money for more things you kill.
[37:59.84]I'll just fly around and splash some stuff.
[38:06.04]Main system activating combat mode.
[38:08.18]Alright, destroy all the destroy all the stuff.
[38:15.37]Destroy all the stuff replacements.
[38:27.23]OK.
[38:29.73]Alright, turn it off.
[38:42.72]This time matter.
[38:45.52]Does it matter at all?
[38:47.18]Or no?
[38:52.85]No, okay.
[38:54.53]Oh shit!
[39:34.02]Hop!
[39:34.60]Alright, watch that boost.
[39:36.70]I gotta be careful of that.
[39:41.95]I'm gonna lose that boost a lot if I'm not careful.
[39:54.88]Alright, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[39:56.46]Careful, careful, careful.
[39:57.82]Turn that off.
[40:00.37]Wait till the boost gets up here.
[40:11.02]Oh!
[40:22.82]I can see how this game gets very, very fun, especially when you start upgrading and changing stuff.
[40:31.69]Alright, let's get out of here.
[40:51.90]Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
[41:01.12]That's a lot of shit over there.
[41:02.66]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[41:03.50]That's too much stuff.
[41:06.06]Alright, turn.
[41:06.90]Let's chill out for a sec.
[41:08.30]Alright, here we go.
[41:13.54]Oh, ouch, ow, ow, ow.
[41:25.03]I'm stuck on the fucking thing.
[41:33.96]What's happening?
[42:00.28]Oh.
[42:02.02]It was a good thought.
[42:12.19]One more.
[42:17.12]That's it, right?
[42:19.00]Ooh, alright, cool.
[42:28.57]I just win.
[42:35.60]120,000.
[42:38.12]So the missions are kind of snappy then.
[42:48.31]That's my favorite part about the game so far.
[42:50.69]Stuff is just snappy.
[42:55.81]Registration number RB23.
[42:58.33]Call sign, Raven.
[43:00.05]Your return to mercenary activities has been acknowledged.
[43:04.04]Restoring access to the... It's got some FromSoftware crispness.
[43:08.84]I can't even talk.
[43:10.32]It does have that FromSoftware crispness.
[43:16.43]New training.
[43:20.31]Bye.
[43:20.73]Ooh.
[43:27.48]First rifle.
[43:29.32]Handgun sounds kind of fun.
[43:32.18]Bazooka, though.
[43:32.90]Alright.
[43:34.04]Attack power.
[43:36.04]Huge on the bazooka.
[43:40.12]Christmas in August.
[43:47.05]Honestly, I feel like that's the kind of weapon I would like to use.
[43:50.15]There's only one.
[43:55.53]How many shots is it?
[44:06.34]6?
[44:06.78]7?
[44:07.66]Under total rounds.
[44:12.11]105?
[44:12.29]I think I'm going to buy the bazooka.
[44:20.83]Oh, there it is.
[44:23.81]Recoil.
[44:30.21]This thing is probably just really good for finishing stuff off.
[44:34.36]I'm getting the bazooka.
[44:38.72]Oh, there's so much more.
[44:39.56]Alright.
[44:39.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:41.00]I need simplified info.
[44:44.34]First rifle.
[44:45.62]This is the other hand.
[44:47.69]The other hand right now has the slash on it.
[44:50.69]I don't know if I want to replace that.
[44:54.81]Although an assault rifle would be amazing.
[44:56.59]Hmm.
[44:59.17]Hmm.
[45:01.96]That would be good too.
[45:02.70]I think I want this.
[45:07.75]I already have one of these though, don't I?
[45:09.63]Alright, we're going bazooka on right hand.
[45:27.22]Oh, I can't.
[45:40.15]Okay.
[45:44.39]No back unit.
[45:45.99]You need one for each hand.
[45:48.77]Ah, okay.
[45:49.87]That makes sense.
[45:50.57]I'm going to get it.
[45:55.75]I feel like having a big bazooka and then having to be able to finish it off with the machine gun is good.
[46:00.48]Let's give it a try.
[46:07.40]I don't have a sword anymore, but it's alright.
[46:16.31]Different missile launcher.
[46:17.19]Pulse shield.
[46:23.06]Another missile.
[46:23.64]Oh, I can do double missile launcher.
[46:24.88]That would be awesome.
[46:26.66]What about the shield?
[46:31.08]What does this do?
[46:31.62]Okay, so it just blocks a bunch of... Does it just block all damage or... It's a parry.
[46:42.73]It's hard.
[46:43.09]It's a parry.
[46:43.63]I'll just do double missile launcher.
[46:46.33]Yeah, let's go.
[46:48.03]Why not?
[46:52.58]This is a left bumper, right?
[47:03.86]OK.
[47:07.36]It was some new training.
[47:09.60]Which I'm going to do because I want the item.
[47:20.92]Charge attacks.
[47:28.92]Ooh.
[47:31.30]Wow.
[47:32.12]Okay.
[47:37.07]This thing is disgusting.
[47:45.51]How many shots does this have before it needs to be reloaded?
[47:52.41]got 12 alright what about uh what happened to my wait a minute what's going on here why is it giving me this stuff oh it's going to teach me how to do this attitude control system of a craft can be compromised by accumulating strain from the impact of repeated attacks so this is the stagger system
[48:24.87]So when you get that overloaded, you get into stagger.
[48:28.51]Yeah, that's what I figured it was doing.
[48:31.69]During which time the afflicted craft will be immobilized and susceptible to critical damage.
[48:37.47]So once you get that stagger, that's when you just unload everything.
[48:49.18]During stagger, all incoming attacks are treated as direct hits and deal much more damage.
[48:55.74]Okay, so you just... There, okay.
[49:07.28]But how long does it last for?
[49:08.26]Not very long, honestly.
[49:09.19]Cool.
[49:24.76]Yeah, I think I get it.
[49:25.76]Oops.
[49:35.96]Uh, ACS strain afflicted on enemies resets after a brief interval but a portion of that strain will remain.
[49:42.88]Weapons vary in the amount of accumulative strain they inflict with explosive impact generally leaving the most.
[49:49.90]Okay.
[49:55.65]That's quite the strain.
[50:10.25]So this is the boss killer.
[50:11.15]You need to do this to kill bosses.
[50:21.71]Surprise attacks.
[50:23.49]Attacks on enemies that are unaware of your presence will inflict greater strain.
[50:29.94]Okay, so they're unaware of you.
[50:39.40]They're not aware.
[50:40.02]It does do a lot more damage.
[51:00.61]Shields equipped to the left shoulder can be deployed to reduce incoming damage from ACS strain.
[51:05.55]Okay.
[51:12.92]What's the charge on it?
[51:13.72]You can do it pretty much instantly.
[51:15.92]Am I doing it wrong?
[51:22.20]Okay.
[51:30.97]It overheats.
[51:31.99]Oh.
[51:46.88]Shield output is maximized for one to two seconds after deployment.
[51:51.13]Blocking during the initial guard window can help to minimize incoming damage.
[51:55.53]Alright, so it is a parry.
[51:59.47]OK, so one to pop.
[52:05.38]I get it.
[52:35.41]Although I don't have a shield on right now.
[52:46.34]They don't take very much damage from the front if they're shielded.
[52:51.40]Oh, I skipped that.
[52:52.12]Shit, what did that mean?
[52:54.14]I skipped that.
[52:54.72]What did that say?
[53:02.85]Attack while assault boosted.
[53:04.19]Alright, got it.
[53:17.17]Yeah.
[53:18.51]I think I was doing that before though.
[53:34.25]Okay.
[53:37.27]Attack while assault boosted gives you more stagger.
[53:41.33]Ah.
[53:47.36]linear rifle.
[53:49.74]Let's check it.
[53:56.59]Oh, just the regular rifle.
[54:00.45]Other arm, though, probably, right?
[54:01.77]No?
[54:02.11]What is it?
[54:07.61]I'm gonna keep what I got.
[54:09.31]That's the tutorial gun.
[54:10.40]It's the one you just used in the tutorial.
[54:11.54]Okay, I see.
[54:12.28]Oh, the charge one.
[54:13.02]Alright.
[54:13.90]I actually really like that, but
[54:16.99]We'll test this out for now.
[54:27.04]Got a job for you, 621.
[54:28.80]I like it.
[54:29.86]It's an open call from the Archibus Group, one of the extraplanetary corporate forces.
[54:36.00]To all independent mercenaries, this request comes from Schneider of the Archibus Group.
[54:42.29]I think it's good.
[55:04.07]It gets better and better down the line.
[55:33.39]Missions get better and better.
[55:34.83]How many?
[55:35.29]OK, so here's a here's a question.
[55:37.71]How many bosses are in the game?
[55:45.26]Are there like?
[55:49.18]There's a lot.
[55:51.56]Because I love bosses.
[55:52.82]Bosses is my favorite part about any of the FromSoftware games.
[55:54.97]Now I know this is not Dark Souls.
[55:56.37]I know I was told don't do that.
[56:00.09]But is a boss battles a big part of this game?
[56:09.07]Yes, OK.
[56:09.49]Play the game and find out.
[56:13.75]Alright.
[56:13.93]Let's go so I got a new weapon.
[56:38.36]Sure, let me can I test it?
[56:42.88]It's one shot and then it reloads.
[56:44.42]What about this one?
[56:45.00]It's just a machine gun.
[56:47.58]I got the double launcher now.
[56:49.10]It's just cool.
[56:51.97]Let's see what happens.
[56:52.71]Enemy attack when they see.
[57:10.10]Ooh, that was a good shot.
[57:17.85]Shit.
[57:20.85]I'm trying to hit him with... There we go.
[57:27.40]Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[57:51.74]I like doing the double bomb.
[57:56.25]Look at that.
[58:00.65]Cool.
[58:15.66]Alright, here they come.
[58:17.46]Boost is still on.
[58:18.28]Wait for reloads.
[58:20.01]Let's-a go.
[58:24.55]Enemy shields analyzed!
[58:41.56]I can't believe I lost to this scum!
[58:58.02]Oh, don't fall.
[59:13.39]Anybody else?
[59:14.05]Cool.
[59:14.21]I did it.
[59:14.47]Kind of reminds me of
[59:28.37]EDF.
[59:29.51]A little bit.
[59:34.32]Is that accurate?
[59:38.98]A little bit.
[59:40.40]When is the next EDF coming out?
[59:48.00]It's out in Japan right now, right?
[59:56.50]He's streaming tonight because he wants to advertise the U2s.
[60:00.56]I actually haven't even done that.
[60:01.84]Thanks for reminding me.
[60:02.80]I just, I like, thanks for the reminder.
[60:05.82]Log hunt.
[60:26.69]You've been invited to join Log Hunt, one of all mine's mercenary support programs.
[60:32.49]Okay.
[60:36.79]I got more money.
[60:37.35]Handgun on the right side now.
[60:45.56]You can do double handgun.
[60:50.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[60:52.39]What is this?
[60:53.13]Pulse shield?
[60:54.37]No, I know what that is.
[60:56.43]I can put a different head on?
[61:01.84]Incorporates only the most essential functionality with a minimalist build in keeping with Defeng's stout tree, slender branches philosophy.
[61:10.26]It's really lightweight.
[61:20.54]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[61:22.04]I did not know you... Oh, okay.
[61:26.77]It's not just... It's everything.
[61:37.57]I get it.
[61:38.19]So you end up making your favorite spore monster, right?
[61:43.56]You put the legs on, you put the arms on.
[61:49.68]Okay, but most importantly, what does this do for me right now if I were to do that?
[61:56.38]Lose a ton of stability, lose a ton of recovery, lose a bunch of AP.
[62:02.15]I don't think I'm going to mess around with this right now.
[62:08.17]Defense and speed.
[62:09.09]Press Y on it.
[62:16.17]More explosive defense.
[62:18.59]Scan duration is up.
[62:20.88]Anti-explosive defense.
[62:23.80]Speed boost is better.
[62:26.68]Load better.
[62:30.32]Stop overwhelming him.
[62:32.92]It mostly just means light.
[62:34.46]Yeah.
[62:35.78]I'm not going to do that right now.
[62:38.89]But I am going to do this.
[62:47.70]I'm going to save my money.
[62:55.72]Destroy targets, destroy enemy AC.
[63:00.98]Let's do the transport helicopter one.
[63:05.78]The important part is actually the legs.
[63:15.53]You can sell items for the same price you bought them for.
[63:18.19]That's good to know.
[63:19.21]Sell anything you're not using.
[63:23.31]Hmm.
[63:44.19]I'm going to stick with what I got.
[63:45.81]Okay, destroy targets.
[63:47.12]Destroy all the Rubicon Liberation Front logistics helicopters.
[64:14.83]I like this game because it's telling me just very direct instructions.
[64:20.06]Kill that thing with the blue target on it.
[64:23.22]I can do that.
[64:28.12]You've given me four buttons and I just kill that thing right there.
[64:33.65]I'm going to love this game.
[64:34.71]Commence mission.
[64:40.07]Destroy the Robocop Liberation Front transport choppers.
[65:02.92]Very nice.
[65:03.36]Alright, need another chopper.
[65:08.97]Hang on for a sec.
[65:22.11]Watch out.
[65:34.07]Hit it!
[65:35.17]Yes!
[65:45.17]Ready to reload!
[65:57.02]You do not need to change targets for the multi-lock.
[66:01.06]Ah!
[66:10.85]Oh, I took too much damage there.
[66:11.89]That was stupid.
[66:12.87]Alright, let me wait till my stacker goes down.
[66:17.57]Can I let off steam or something?
[66:26.22]Can I get splash damage too?
[66:34.96]Okay.
[66:50.65]Oops.
[66:56.81]Gotta go in the air.
[67:16.09]Whoa!
[67:27.19]Alright, I'm start- I'm getting a feel for it.
[67:28.59]I understand what's going on.
[67:29.31]I think this is really hard.
[67:34.66]Left shoulder ammunition at 50%.
[67:39.18]AP at 50%.
[68:10.55]Damn alright.
[68:15.01]That wasn't even the target.
[68:17.11]That was optional.
[68:18.09]That was fun.
[68:19.63]Cool.
[68:41.66]Combat logs give parts.
[68:45.14]Should I be looking for those?
[68:47.76]I feel like I haven't scanned the game once.
[68:50.21]That's a new menu.
[69:10.20]Optional mini-bosses like that give you logs.
[69:14.08]Ah.
[69:16.08]Gotcha.
[69:16.40]Training?
[69:18.04]Training?
[69:40.06]Yeah, I like that you can replay missions as many times as you want.
[69:43.56]That's a good feature.
[69:56.15]Um... This might be really stupid, but I'm kind of into it.
[70:01.82]I'm doing double bazooka.
[70:22.78]I would probably use this very well.
[70:25.89]But... The missiles are fun to use.
[70:31.43]Okay, I have enough to unlock a new head.
[70:34.11]This one is... More stability.
[70:39.28]More recovery.
[70:42.10]This is the Ster one.
[70:44.14]Right?
[70:44.52]This is the one that Ster is playing with right now.
[70:47.94]And then there's this one.
[70:54.80]Lightweight.
[70:58.66]Okay.
[70:59.88]So, I know I have this down to the very, very bare bones reduced menu.
[71:05.30]But what is AP?
[71:06.82]Stability and... Recovery, I'm imagining, is how... I get that one.
[71:11.72]What is stability in AP?
[71:14.34]AP is health.
[71:18.74]And then what is stability?
[71:20.48]Armor?
[71:22.09]Oh.
[71:22.17]I can just
[71:26.34]resilience okay resilience of the part maximum load doesn't really help oh okay it's kind of it's like it's like armor this is the posture so this is health posture and then healing essentially poise alright this is status
[71:53.82]Alright, that's a very simplified version of it.
[71:56.48]I definitely think I want the one that has more health.
[72:03.59]I'm gonna do this one.
[72:05.09]That's a big increase.
[72:09.85]We have a... We have a Jerma logo.
[72:12.64]Oh, okay.
[72:13.62]Maybe I'll put it on.
[72:16.16]What is that?
[72:17.50]I have maybe.
[72:18.38]I have maybe I'll put it on.
[72:21.89]That sounded so, that was like a, I did not mean for that to come out the way that that did.
[72:36.10]Uh, alright.
[72:38.96]No, I, I think I'm going to keep playing this game.
[72:42.98]Although I did say that for Final Fantasy 16.
[72:48.11]But, you know, we'll see.
[72:49.39]I really, I need to play Final Fantasy.
[72:51.03]I really was into it too.
[72:55.65]I'm getting this one and I'm putting it on.
[73:03.78]So this is heavier, but a lot more defense and health is what I want.
[73:13.88]The head is just for fashion, to be honest.
[73:27.02]Okay.
[73:27.14]Yeah, I don't know how much longer I'm going to be streaming for.
[73:29.98]I planned on like three or four hours tonight.
[73:35.80]It's an open call from the Archivist Group.
[73:40.87]To all independent mercenaries, this request comes from Schneider of the Archivist Group.
[73:47.71]Dafong, one of our adversaries allied with Balem, has introduced a new tester AC.
[73:56.73]The Zooka strat is gonna go down.
[73:59.19]Oh, it's not good for this?
[74:00.23]We're never seeing this again?
[74:02.37]I... I would not say that.
[74:25.56]I'll tell you one reason why.
[74:26.85]I said that for Final Fantasy 16, but let me give you a reason why I think that you would see this again.
[74:34.19]I can open a mission and be done with it in 10 minutes.
[74:38.92]I can open up a mission and lose 10 times in a row and then move to something else.

[75:25.47]What about the logo?
[75:26.73]Oh, shit.
[75:27.41]I forgot about the logo.
[75:30.65]I am going to be decked out in decals the next time you see me play this.
[75:35.27]I will use that one.

[77:40.60]Oh, it's so slow.
[77:48.43]Did I get it or did I die?
[77:49.55]Oh, I got it.
[77:52.91]That's kind of sad.
[77:58.85]That was sad.
[78:11.00]That was a student driver.
[78:12.42]Oh, shit.
[78:15.70]Oops.
[78:25.40]What's wrong with you?
[78:26.66]What?
[78:26.99]I was told to... Oh, uh-oh.
[78:41.11]Am I on the bad team?
[78:42.27]We're not on the good team.
[78:43.31]I thought we were good guys.
[78:44.69]Gen 4s can be emotionally withdrawn.
[78:46.75]They need a shot in the arm every now and then.
[78:48.79]And you got a deal.

[80:29.52]Oh, here?
[80:30.63]Alright, this is the new one.
[80:36.79]So this is a... Much heavier.
[80:42.02]But I get a lot more thrust.
[80:45.26]I'll try it.
[80:57.50]Attack the dam complex.
[80:58.68]Destroy the weaponized mining ship.
[81:02.66]These are very expensive.
[81:06.68]This looks like a boss.
[81:12.43]Do the logo?
[81:13.53]Oh, okay.
[81:13.91]I'll do the logo.

[82:32.51]That is a 100% guarantee.
[82:33.09]You said that about Breath of the Wild?
[82:34.33]I played Breath of the Wild again.
[82:56.86]Just like Street Fighter 6?
[82:58.12]Just like Yakuza 0?
[82:58.88]You said you were gonna finish Breath of the Wild by May.
[83:26.21]Yeah, May of 2022.
[83:32.95]It was like May of last year, wasn't it?
[83:37.00]Wow.
[83:37.78]Oh, well, it's okay.
[83:39.00]Alright.
[83:40.62]Attack the base.
[83:41.92]Destroy the infrastructure.
[83:43.34]This is for a lot of money.
[83:48.60]Gun 13.
[83:50.86]I'll stick with 621.
[83:56.35]You also said the three Stooges were going to be in Fortnite.
[83:59.79]That was a good call, though.
[84:01.33]You cannot tell me what they've put in that game in the last couple of years that I... That was a bad call.
[84:07.18]Allies.
[84:07.56]Attack!
[84:07.80]Get in there!
[84:30.38]Double missiles, thank you.
[84:38.81]Got it.
[84:39.23]Can I get them both?
[84:54.75]Good shot.
[85:23.05]Dude, I'm loving the double missiles.
[85:24.33]It's great.
[85:28.35]I'm going to up this way.
[85:32.07]Somebody's door is open in the car.
[86:07.27]Who said double bazooka was bad?
[86:09.98]Char yourself.
[86:36.47]Last one.
[86:44.01]Both my allies alive?
[86:46.01]Oh, shit.
[86:46.77]Here we go.
[86:47.17]Oh, shit.
[87:02.21]Alright, get that stagger.
[87:17.35]Oh, that was a lot of damage.
[87:18.21]Good.
[87:33.77]Oh, I'm out of boost.
[87:45.49]Oh!
[87:46.35]That was a lot of damage.
[87:47.28]Nice.
[88:06.14]Oh, they all missed.
[88:06.82]I don't think any of your missiles hit.
[88:16.50]Oh.
[88:16.78]I'm on it.
[88:35.14]Oh, that's sad.
[88:35.98]I want to get more money.
[89:13.07]Hey, wait.
[89:13.95]Expenses?
[89:18.63]I have expenses?
[89:19.43]$41,000?
[89:23.17]That seems like a lot.
[89:29.47]That seems like a lot to spend on ammo.
[89:40.13]Okay.
[89:44.26]They're using a lot of missiles and a lot of bazookas.
[89:47.40]It's alright.
[89:48.70]With that kind of firepower, I'm happy being broke.
[89:51.62]That's okay.
[89:55.75]Okay.
[90:14.17]Emblem acquired.
[90:18.39]Did I unlock some new stuff?
[90:23.19]Okay, I can afford something now.
[90:24.45]Hold on.
[90:26.23]How much?
[90:26.67]149?
[90:27.03]I can get new legs.
[90:34.44]Firearm specialization.
[90:35.96]What is that?
[90:41.14]That's a huge increase.
[90:42.84]What does that one do?
[90:55.75]Prove target tracking performance.
[90:59.79]OK, actually might want that.
[91:05.59]That's kind of good, right?
[91:06.73]For what I have.
[91:08.67]Double missile.
[91:15.37]I'll try it.
[91:29.39]Wait, what?
[91:32.09]Oh, these... Wait, they're... I thought they were legs.
[91:37.06]Oops.
[91:39.28]Okay, we're okay.
[91:40.04]We're okay.
[91:40.56]We're okay.
[91:41.04]We're okay.
[91:44.36]I'll try this one out.
[91:49.18]Alright, this seems like a boss.
[91:51.65]Destroy the boss.
[91:53.65]I'll give it a go.
[91:56.91]Okay.
[92:27.38]resource base that was extensively weaponized by the liberation front call it the crowning glory of their efforts to militarize into an anti-corporate force yeah can you attack will focus on the eye yeah a giant laser cannon connected directly to the main generator yeah can you um protected by a shield yep which is powered by auxiliary sub generators
[92:54.07]yep can you um yeah good luck can you just put a blue target on it and I'll do everything else I don't need to hear any other things time for a little self-promotion 621 smash the strider and archibus hq will be sure to remember your name give me caveman mode give me food mode
[93:27.36]This kind of is caveman mode.
[93:28.96]That's why I like it so much.
[93:30.10]Alright.
[93:33.00]Destroy the ship.
[93:34.74]I understand that.
[93:36.11]First, get through all that dust and make contact with the Strider.
[93:49.85]Well, that's big.
[93:50.91]An unidentified AC.
[93:51.89]Must be one of the corporation's dogs.
[93:55.64]Activate the eye.
[93:56.62]Throw them away.
[94:00.19]Oh, that's good tracking.
[94:11.73]What is that sound?
[94:13.49]That was scary.
[94:25.04]OK, I see.
[94:25.94]I see.
[94:26.22]I get it.
[94:26.56]I get it.
[94:26.90]I see what's happening.
[94:38.18]That didn't work.
[94:40.16]I thought I could dodge that.
[94:42.62]AP at 50%.
[94:48.90]Is it a simple dodge?
[94:55.41]Ow.
[94:56.37]Alright, now you're up close and personal.
[94:58.21]There's no iframes.
[94:59.25]Okay.
[94:59.51]He evaded the eye's laser.
[95:06.87]Alright.
[95:19.00]Be careful.
[95:19.50]I don't have any health.
[95:28.14]I shot the fucking rock.
[95:32.29]Alright.
[95:40.92]That's not going to land on me, right?
[95:53.73]That's much further away than I thought it was.
[95:55.92]I need boost.
[96:05.50]Alright.
[96:12.91]No!
[96:13.91]Okay, I'm fine.
[96:26.34]I'm gonna go up first.
[96:29.94]What is happening?
[96:30.58]Something's shooting at me?
[96:33.22]Alright, really that does not want me over there.
[96:34.82]There's one.
[96:58.40]Oh, I'm not doing this right.
[97:17.55]Get up there!
[97:18.37]Shit!
[97:20.11]Oh!
[97:22.97]God damn it.
[97:32.07]I know, I'm too deep here though.
[97:39.28]I just do it, just go all the way back.
[97:41.34]I just didn't want to go all the way back this way.
[97:53.67]I'm too far away from that now.
[97:57.23]I'll be fine, just wait.
[98:12.30]I- I got it.
[98:24.79]I got it.
[98:25.49]I got it.
[98:25.95]I got it.
[98:26.55]I've never ever seen anybody fail this before.
[98:29.87]Well, I was- Hey, I beat the first boss in two tries.
[98:36.34]You didn't.
[98:39.36]That- that required movement and shit.
[98:43.77]I want the money.
[98:46.19]I know it's expensive.
[98:47.73]I don't care.
[98:50.49]I want the money.
[98:52.31]What the?
[98:52.71]Main system activating combat mode.
[99:17.47]Okay.
[99:18.73]He's plagued with greed.
[99:23.34]I would have had it that last time.
[99:25.08]It's just I didn't realize I had to climb up the back of the fucking elephant's legs or whatever the hell it is.
[99:29.86]Okay.
[99:31.54]Here it comes.
[99:31.98]Alright, alright, alright.
[99:44.09]Here it comes.
[99:48.41]I get it now.
[99:49.13]Okay, everybody relax.
[99:50.39]Okay, we're good.
[99:57.84]Alright, here we go.
[100:24.01]Hey!
[100:24.17]Here we go.
[100:24.57]Now it's time.
[100:25.13]Here we go.
[100:55.23]That should do it, right?
[100:55.99]Alright, now climb the back.
[101:06.74]The bigger they are, the harder they fall!
[101:30.93]Hey, I did it!
[101:31.39]Hold on, let me get some juice.
[101:41.73]I'm trying to counter-run.
[101:48.35]Head to the midships.
[102:00.75]Where are you?
[102:01.31]Who's shooting at me?
[102:09.55]No, no, turn the boost off, turn the boost off.
[102:11.05]It's flying me around.
[102:27.82]There it is.
[102:28.36]Oh shit.
[102:34.28]Alright, I gotta get in there and shoot this.
[102:35.60]Okay, hold out right here.
[102:44.72]I'm gonna go up.
[102:53.04]Oh my god!
[102:57.33]Oh, that's a fucking Sauron eye!
[103:03.17]Oh my God, I have to get the fuck out of here.
[103:04.87]I have to get the fuck out of here.
[103:11.91]Okay.
[103:14.25]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[103:18.67]Whoa!
[103:31.67]Is it alive?
[103:32.63]Shit.
[103:50.28]Just fucking flew into the goddamn wall.
[103:53.08]Alright, just one more.
[103:53.90]It's underneath.
[103:54.50]Um, where is it though?
[103:58.50]I'm gonna get lost.
[104:03.75]Oh, shit.
[104:07.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[104:17.22]No.
[104:18.86]No.
[104:22.74]What the fuck just happened?
[104:25.32]What just happened?
[104:27.24]Okay.
[104:28.16]Okay.
[104:29.62]At 30%.
[104:35.13]No, stop.
[104:36.81]Dude, hold on.
[104:38.19]Stop moving for a second.
[104:41.25]It just, I'm already in the air.
[104:44.74]Alright, how, get me up.
[105:00.73]Dude, how the fuck am I going to get over there?
[105:22.79]Okay, I gotta- I gotta be on my mark here.
[105:29.17]What?
[105:30.07]Okay, we're fine.
[105:35.01]What's up?
[105:35.79]What's up, bud?
[105:38.55]Am I doing any damage?
[106:02.05]It's not gonna... Oh, goddammit.
[106:10.14]This one's hard.
[106:11.36]This one's hard because it's a lot of traversing a ton of area, and I hate that.
[106:19.30]Floating in the air to get to another ledge in these games makes me want to throw up.
[106:24.69]Wait, checkpoint?
[106:28.85]Oh, that's better.
[106:56.26]Oh, no, no, no.
[106:59.47]No, I refuse.
[107:24.93]Alright, I need boost.
[107:25.49]I need boost back.
[107:29.93]Oh!
[107:34.76]Just die already!
[107:35.80]Oh my god, I'm gonna die here.
[107:41.42]Ugh.
[107:49.26]Okay, I might not have the best equipment for this guy, but I'll get it.
[108:19.77]Stay really close.
[108:20.45]I think that's the strategy.
[108:44.36]Get back in close, close, close, close, close, close, close.
[108:57.07]Okay, alright.
[108:58.03]We're good.
[108:58.37]We're good.
[108:58.63]We're good.
[108:58.85]We're good.
[108:59.11]We're good.
[109:02.03]That one was pretty hard.
[109:04.24]That was fun.
[109:24.11]Get me the fuck away from this thing.
[109:30.86]See you later, punk.
[109:33.00]Alright, how do I emote?
[110:20.65]Alright, $270,000 in pay with $62,000 in expenses.
[110:29.28]$36,000.
[110:30.08]Alright, that's where they get you.
[110:33.34]They get you with the repair costs.
[110:40.30]That's fun, though.
[110:42.00]I'm surprised there's checkpoints.
[110:45.26]That seems pretty new to...
[110:48.55]Although this is not Dark Souls, but... You're gonna need him later.
[110:52.68]Oh, what the fuck?
[110:53.86]Dark Souls guys made this.
[110:55.04]I will say.
[111:20.55]I feel like the FromSoftware devs are so talented.
[111:24.65]And they've done so many interesting things.
[111:27.83]That... Do you think that when people say that... Oh, Dark Souls!
[111:31.06]The Dark Souls guys!
[111:34.90]That's like when people come here and say that... Oh, it's the guy... It's the sus guy.
[111:38.30]And it's the ball up his ass guy.
[111:40.56]I do more than that.
[111:54.09]Being the sus guy is not like Dark Souls.
[112:02.54]That was not a good comparison.
[112:03.92]You just equated yourself to FromSoftware?
[112:05.16]No!
[112:05.82]No, I am not even nearly as talented.
[112:08.10]I don't have even a fingernail of talent on the FromSoftware devs.
[112:24.72]But... I can do this.
[112:29.43]I don't think very many people can do that.
[113:04.70]That scared the shit out of me.
[113:11.12]Alright.
[113:11.38]That's going to be it.
[113:12.28]I'm going to call it here.
[113:14.30]Only plan to be in live for like four hours or so.
[113:25.11]But I will tell you, I... Wait.
[113:29.19]This thing is $200,000.
[113:29.69]And I want it.
[113:37.24]It can charge.
[113:48.32]We'll play again.
[113:48.91]Okay.

[116:23.17]They are available and they will be available until two weeks from right now.
[116:27.73]And then I think it's going to take a month or so before they start shipping out.
[116:32.55]Yep.
[116:35.17]I might bring it up a week or so from now, but I think you guys get it.
[116:40.72]They're available.
[116:41.62]We can talk about it maybe a week or two from now when it's almost over.
[116:44.66]But yeah, they are available.
[116:46.52]See you later.
[116:48.68]That is the end of the stream.
[116:50.06]Almost exactly.
[116:51.52]No, it's more than four hours.
[116:54.53]That was a really fun stream, though.
[116:59.61]Thanks for Poke.
[117:00.83]Thanks to Poke for being a good sport.
[117:03.99]That was really fun doing the weird stream inception thing.
[117:10.56]Appreciate it, Poke.
[117:11.36]Thanks for the game recommendation too.
[117:12.50]Game was a lot of fun.
[117:14.49]If you came over here from Poke's channel during all that, maybe we'll see you again another time.
[117:22.43]Next time you see me live will probably be later on the end of this week.
[117:25.82]Keep an eye on the sus.
[117:27.52]I will come in probably Wednesday or Thursday to update it.
[117:30.48]I'm imagining either probably Friday or Sunday is where I'm thinking.
[117:36.00]But not set in stone.
[117:37.21]Just keep an eye on the sus.
[117:39.51]I will update it at least a couple days in advance.
[117:42.59]And we are going to be playing Sorcery Part 4.
[117:44.21]Going to continue that playthrough whether it's Friday or Sunday.
[117:50.24]And then after that,
[117:52.36]It's kind of up in the air.
[117:53.02]We'll see.
[117:53.28]Good times?
[118:04.40]Yeah, good times.
[118:06.84]I know you're a Game Pass Andy.
[118:08.02]Are we going to be playing Starfield?
[118:09.75]I will definitely stream Starfield at least once.
[118:13.45]Just because I feel like it's going to be one of those games that you're going to have to play.
[118:17.59]Just because of how many options of things there might be to do.
[118:31.46]But I would imagine if after Sorcery, I don't really know what else to play, we're just going to play this.
[118:39.23]I was a little concerned opening it, thinking, hold on, this might not be for me.
[118:42.85]I think it is for me.
[118:43.89]I think it is very much for me.
[118:46.66]So you are going to see Armored Core 6 again.
[118:49.18]I had a great time playing it.
[118:51.72]I'd like to continue playing it.
[118:53.60]I am going to need your help, though.
[118:54.66]I'm not going to pretend like I'm going to do this all on my own.
[119:00.00]I'm going to be looking for help, especially if I get stuck.
[119:08.29]Feel free to backseat when it's necessary.
[119:15.49]What about Baldur's Gate 3?
[119:16.86]I think I'm going to play Baldur's Gate 3 on my own.
[119:20.52]That's kind of a game I'd like to play.
[119:23.30]Just not being on stream.
[119:31.57]You'd love it.
[119:32.17]I probably will.
[119:35.03]Vinny is playing a duck game.
[119:40.86]Wait, is Vinny playing that duck game?
[119:43.72]Or a different one?
[119:44.34]There's a lot of duck games.
[119:46.36]I'm not sure which one you mean.
[119:53.86]Uh, Vinny's going to bed.
[119:55.36]Oh, is he?
[119:58.42]Is Poke streaming still or no?
[119:59.47]Let me see.
[120:02.69]I'll dump you guys on Poke if he's still alive.
[120:10.33]Poke is?
[120:10.73]Okay, yeah.
[120:11.39]Uh, go say hi to Poke.
[120:13.83]Say, um, that was fun.
[120:15.93]Um, say that was fun.
[120:17.61]You're a good sport.
[120:20.30]With a thumbs up or a happy emote.
[120:28.15]I will see you guys later.
[120:29.15]See you at the end of the week.
[120:32.65]Take care of yourselves.
[120:36.66]See you soon.
[120:37.74]Good night.
[120:39.74]Call your mother.
[120:40.92]See you later.
[121:30.14]you
