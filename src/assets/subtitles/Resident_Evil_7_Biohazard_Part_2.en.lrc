[01:20.48]How you doing?
[01:22.24]Good.
[01:22.40]Hope you're doing good.
[01:27.74]Pardon me, I'm currently eating.
[01:31.44]I was, uh... I actually just got home.
[01:34.16]Like, 15 minutes ago.
[01:36.82]I was out and about.
[01:37.44]You don't know how it is.
[01:40.30]But here we are now.
[01:42.68]Just need to get a little peanut butter and chocolate in my body.
[01:45.77]Some nougat.
[01:47.89]Of course I'm talking about the Mars bar.
[01:50.61]Mars.
[01:52.90]Not just a distant memory.
[01:55.18]Also a candy.
[01:56.54]A great one.
[01:57.98]Mars.
[01:59.78]Travel to the destination in your mouth.
[02:03.92]Get it at your local fucking grocery store.
[02:11.07]Put it under a child's pillow.
[02:12.91]If the tooth fairy was supposed to come because their tooth came out.
[02:17.83]Or give them money.
[02:20.73]Do you have any sons or daughters?
[02:22.91]You could give them a Mars bar.
[02:23.99]Alright, let me... Hold on a second.
[02:28.63]I'll be right back.
[02:30.11]We're gonna start this over.
[02:31.21]I'll be right back, guys.
[02:32.74]I gotta grab my phone.
[02:33.80]And then we'll get going.
[02:34.74]I'll see you guys in like two minutes.

[04:41.81]It actually took me a little bit to find this phone.
[04:48.24]Hold on.
[04:53.64]Just writing a tweet.
[04:56.68]Hopefully I don't fuck it up this time, like I did last time.
[05:02.51]I got my drink here, because, you know, to play Resident Evil 7 in VR...
[05:07.69]I need to, like, drink booze.
[05:09.91]Is that bad?
[05:13.23]I feel like that's bad.
[05:16.01]Not very much.
[05:16.71]I'm not drinking very much.
[05:18.39]Just enough for me to not, like, shit my pants.
[05:20.21]Alright, I got my helmet here.
[05:23.68]Turn it on.
[05:25.24]Screen's gonna go black for a second.
[05:27.88]Make sure this shit is in the right spot.
[05:32.02]Uh, hold on.
[05:32.72]Can you see me?
[05:33.60]Ah, shit!

[07:30.23]Scripted?
[07:30.83]Dude, you can't script a bulb going out.
[07:35.55]What the fuck are you talking about?
[07:38.77]Oh yeah, I scripted that.
[07:41.69]Let me just refer to my script.
[07:42.91]Is this even fucking screwing in?
[07:45.18]Get in there.
[07:55.80]That is not bright enough.
[07:58.72]That's not even fucking close to being bright enough.
[08:00.72]God fucking... Hold on a second.
[08:13.88]What the fuck is this?
[08:16.94]It's going in.
[08:29.12]Did the webcam freeze?
[08:33.26]This is going to be so hot and bright.
[08:34.94]This is going to blow up my house.
[08:40.22]He's going to turn around and he's going to have a clown face.
[08:44.67]Alright, this will do the trick.
[08:49.97]He's stalling?
[08:50.71]I'm not stalling.

[10:34.32]Alright, we're in VR mode now.
[10:35.36]Let's put this on.
[10:38.90]Slide it back.
[10:41.48]And... Just like that.

[10:57.29]What do you think?
[11:00.73]Lower my booster seat.
[11:03.23]I don't have a booster seat on.
[11:07.39]So much gain, I feel like I'm gonna fucking puke.

[11:17.06]What are you guys fucking on about?
[11:19.98]Hold on, I gotta like drink some- I gotta drink some booze!
[11:26.02]Either start slouching or tilt the camera.
[11:27.60]I'm gonna be like this.
[11:29.41]So, you'll be able to see my whole face here.
[11:32.57]I'm just leaning in because, you know, 300% cadence.
[11:35.53]Turn on VR mode.
[11:36.31]Well, I can do that in the options.
[11:37.25]I'll do that in a second.
[11:38.81]Why do I have this on?
[11:40.07]The audio's not synced.
[11:41.73]What the fuck?
[11:42.53]I thought I fixed this shit last night.
[11:47.09]Is it... The audio's not synced.
[11:51.07]I fixed this shit, like, after I turned the stream off yesterday.
[11:56.79]Is it bad enough where, like, I have to fix it again?
[11:58.93]Or is it alright?
[12:05.14]Oh, this is taking a long time to load, by the way.
[12:09.47]Does the device have a lot of wires hanging from it?
[12:11.23]Um, yes and no.
[12:14.20]This is the only wire that comes out of the headset.
[12:17.24]And it goes into a device back there, which I can't show you because... It's like... It's its own box of shit.
[12:26.29]This plugs into like a mini PS4 that has like three wires coming out of it.
[12:30.19]So this thing, no.
[12:31.07]This thing only has one cord that comes out of it.
[12:35.72]But not... It's not that big of a deal.
[12:37.20]As long as you can hide it somewhere.
[12:39.26]It's a little off.
[12:40.16]I...
[12:41.65]Dude, I need to get an internal capture card, for real.
[12:44.03]It is such a pain in the ass.
[12:45.82]Let me turn on VR mode.
[12:51.38]VR mode.
[12:54.82]Okay, we have to go back to the menu.
[12:57.62]Yeah, give me my health warning, that's fine.
[13:03.36]Yeah, remember this one, make sure there's nothing in the way.
[13:06.14]Nothing's in the way, don't worry.
[13:08.13]Just my fucking ugly ass face, not a big deal.
[13:11.27]Why does that light look better than this light?
[13:13.73]Can I have that camera?
[13:16.83]I want that fucking camera down there!
[13:19.95]It looks better!
[13:22.20]Way better!
[13:27.18]What the fuck?
[13:28.66]Whatever.
[13:32.58]Shit looks like 10 times better.
[13:38.44]The webcam is less good than the PSVR camera.
[13:42.10]Alright.
[13:43.36]No VR tutorial.
[13:44.36]Don't need that.
[13:46.74]Let's turn the gain up.
[13:52.02]Turn the gain up a little bit.
[13:53.75]Fuck that.
[13:54.23]It looked way better.
[13:57.17]Advanced settings.
[13:59.73]Turn the gain up.
[14:02.81]A little bit more exposure.
[14:05.37]That's a little better.
[14:06.51]Whatever.
[14:07.89]The thing is, if you turn the gain up too high on a webcam like this, it fucking blows it all out and it makes it go frame rating.
[14:12.87]Alright, I'm ready.
[14:16.16]Well, hold on.
[14:17.64]Not quite ready.
[14:24.92]Almost ready.
[14:30.70]Ladies and gentlemen, uh, if you are of the age of 21 years old and you live in the United States of America and you're of the legal league or wherever you are in the, in the world, and you're of legal drinking age and bottoms up to you because I have to do this.
[14:41.66]Otherwise I can't play this game in VR.
[14:43.44]Spicy.
[14:52.88]Here we go.
[14:53.22]Does that look good?
[15:02.83]Oh, I need my stereophonic headphones.
[15:09.63]Okay.
[15:10.89]This is the right one.
[15:14.96]Here we are.
[15:17.44]Almost ready to go!
[15:18.46]Let's center this.
[15:23.30]There we are.
[15:23.88]Okay.
[15:24.92]This shit is so greasy, it's like almost impossible to see.
[15:30.15]Uh, yes, load the most recent save.
[15:33.72]Oh, I forgot.
[15:34.22]Did I?
[15:35.06]I did turn it off.
[15:35.62]Okay.
[15:39.62]Pass the whiskey.
[15:41.38]Close the bottle?
[15:42.28]Why would I do that?
[15:43.44]I need easy access to it.
[15:44.57]And, fuck, my god, dude.
[15:45.85]Holy shit.
[15:46.69]I can't even see.
[15:49.17]I need, like, a baby wipe.
[15:55.82]I'm 21 in dog years.
[15:56.96]Not enough.
[16:03.31]So I will not be, I cannot read chat and I cannot read notifications.
[16:07.25]This is going to be one of those streams.
[16:12.20]Get off me.
[16:14.84]Alright, going back in.
[16:15.56]Let's see if that helped.
[16:20.44]Yep, that's much better.
[16:23.62]That's better.
[16:24.16]Okay.
[16:26.85]Let's go long loading time.
[16:31.47]Yeah, so from here on out, I cannot see anything anyone is saying.
[16:35.09]I just have to go by the fact that you're all saying very nice things about me.
[16:40.87]Let me just grab my soda.
[16:42.31]Hold on, I'll get it.
[16:51.57]Okay.
[16:52.49]I gotta put that in a better spot.
[16:54.09]Where's the other one?
[16:55.51]That one's right there.
[16:57.81]Where's the other one?
[17:00.35]Is that it?
[17:00.63]Is that it?
[17:01.81]I think that's it.
[17:04.42]What is this?
[17:05.88]That's it.
[17:06.26]Yep.
[17:06.68]There it is.
[17:09.48]Watch this be like fucking cleaner.

[17:24.91]There it is.
[17:26.19]That one's right there.
[17:27.25]That one's right there.

[18:16.10]Dog head.
[18:18.50]Where's the dog head door?
[18:20.08]Right there?
[18:20.44]Alright, let's go!
[18:28.45]Open sesame.

[18:49.80]This looks like total shit.
[18:53.78]I guess I gotta go in there.
[19:00.22]Wait.
[19:00.53]I'm not going there yet.
[19:01.63]Hold on.
[19:01.85]I'm going to rub Buddha's head.

[19:07.17]I'm going to rub the cinder block's head.
[19:08.85]Extra good luck.
[19:16.18]Gunpowder.
[19:16.66]That's good.
[19:17.18]Do I have any chemical fuel?
[19:20.94]Whatever.

[19:23.88]Okay.
[19:26.77]Keep going.
[19:36.26]What the hell even am I?
[19:40.22]Someone's gonna open this door.

[20:10.08]Steroids.
[20:10.62]Increases max health indefinitely.
[20:16.18]Five?
[20:16.68]Three?
[20:17.28]What the fuck are you talking about?
[20:22.22]My body's feeling weirder and weirder.
[20:23.76]Soon I'll become like mom and dad.
[20:25.43]It's all her fault.
[20:26.87]Should I run?
[20:27.51]No, I can't.
[20:28.19]I'm dead if she finds out.
[20:30.17]That woman she was with, Mia, she knows something.
[20:32.99]If I had the serum, I could cure myself.
[20:35.05]I have to find out more.
[20:38.73]Sure.
[20:40.65]This is the happy family.
[20:41.97]This is a little too tight.
[20:43.09]There we go.
[20:47.37]Happy family.
[20:48.35]It's too late for them.
[20:53.29]Another coin.

[21:31.69]I want that magnum.
[21:36.24]I wonder if Twitch chat is freaking the fuck out that I'm about to dump all these into Magnum.
[21:42.24]I wonder what they're saying right now.
[21:44.54]I wonder if people are saying, don't do that.
[21:48.43]I wonder if people are very upset about this.
[21:51.95]I don't know.
[21:52.91]But some part of me doesn't really care.
[21:55.21]I want the fucking $2.25 Magnum.

[23:45.65]Is there a way to get it out?
[23:47.07]We need a serum.

[24:57.46]Democrat or fucking Republican.
[24:58.74]What do I pick?
[25:00.32]What do I pick?
[25:10.87]Oh, okay.
[25:13.97]That's creepy.
[25:20.90]Can I go up this door?
[25:26.52]It's locked from the other side.
[25:27.52]Okay.
[25:30.52]Okay, that's locked.
[25:31.36]Maybe out that way?
[25:34.07]I guess?
[25:36.97]I need, like, a key card.
[25:44.90]car battery looking thing, I don't know.
[25:50.54]I'm gonna try the other way.
[25:57.42]Straight ahead.
[26:05.74]Oh, I can see the moon.
[26:06.52]This thing's reloaded, right?
[26:13.26]Eight shots.
[26:21.38]Hopefully this door opens.
[26:24.38]Yep, it does.
[26:25.46]Oh, this is... This is scary.
[26:29.67]Oh, this is where that crazy lady was.
[26:34.49]From the videotape.
[26:37.65]Oh, no.
[26:38.21]Don't.
[26:40.57]Ah!
[26:40.67]Oh, and there's a little save nipple.
[26:44.25]You know what that means.
[26:45.99]When the save boob comes out.
[26:47.37]You know that shit's about to go down.
[26:51.82]Ugh.
[26:58.58]Nothing?
[26:59.23]Really?
[27:05.87]This is reloaded too?
[27:07.41]Okay.
[27:11.51]What the fuck?
[27:19.50]Whoa.
[27:19.85]Hey, there's bugs.
[27:22.05]There's giant bugs.
[27:24.29]And, great.
[27:30.20]I feel like I shouldn't be using this gun.
[27:32.06]We're gonna go for the stealth kill.
[27:36.85]Good.
[27:50.40]It's like a giant beehive.
[27:52.12]What the fuck is that thing?
[28:02.04]Don't do it.
[28:03.38]Don't do it.
[28:04.52]Don't do it.
[28:07.24]Whoa!
[28:08.04]Whoa!
[28:08.88]A swarm of bats!
[28:10.38]A swarm of fucking bats!
[28:13.24]Whatever these things are, like, cicadas.
[28:16.72]I got a plan.
[28:18.46]There's the plan!
[28:27.25]Get me out.
[28:28.75]Get me out of here.
[28:30.63]Get me the fuck out of here.
[28:36.72]Did it work?
[28:37.98]Did it work?
[28:40.10]Holy shit.
[28:46.55]Fuck.
[28:48.85]God damn it, you little fucks.
[28:58.71]Get the brain!
[29:01.11]Get the brain!
[29:05.08]Got the brain, nice.
[29:11.18]Oh shit, there's a place to go right there.
[29:14.60]It's alright, I got the brain, we're good.
[29:28.44]Should I go down here?
[29:30.35]I don't know.
[29:30.81]God damn it.
[29:42.81]I hear somebody.
[29:44.39]Right?
[29:49.53]What is that?
[29:52.29]What do I do?
[30:01.45]Fuck.
[30:01.91]Uh...
[30:30.34]Yeah, I got the stone statue.
[30:31.40]This is tugging on me.
[30:36.72]Hold on.
[30:48.25]Eat it.
[30:56.43]What is this?
[30:56.73]Supplements?
[30:57.29]Supplements?
[31:02.34]Just get... I need... I need room.
[31:04.78]I need room.
[31:05.18]I need room.
[31:07.38]Fuck!
[31:08.32]Oh, I didn't think this through.
[31:09.66]I did not think this through.
[31:10.84]What's that?
[31:12.74]What is that?
[31:15.97]Get it!
[31:17.01]What?
[31:17.41]Just a fucking Tom Brady statue.
[31:20.45]Oh, there's magic in the fucking Tom Brady statues.
[31:24.63]What?
[31:26.45]I didn't know there was fucking magic inside of Tom Brady.
[31:28.65]Well, I know.
[31:29.23]Hold on a second.
[31:30.89]Of course I knew there was magic inside of Tom Brady.
[31:35.54]Three championships in four years?
[31:37.34]Come on.
[31:37.72]I mean, I knew there was magic in Tom Brady, but not in those particular statues.
[31:43.70]I need that coin.
[31:45.40]I need... God damn it.
[31:52.56]I'm just eating the fucking supplements.
[31:57.76]Eat it again.
[31:59.08]Do it again.
[32:07.73]Go get the coin.
[32:14.34]Everyone's probably gonna think I'm such a fucking idiot, but... Sometimes you have to make sacrifices.
[32:26.05]Sometimes you have to make a sacrifice or two.
[32:27.75]Alright, where am I going?
[32:30.15]This way.
[32:32.45]What the?
[32:42.32]What the fuck, dude?
[32:43.90]Come on.
[32:45.20]What the fuck is going on?
[32:53.10]Ah!
[32:58.82]Get the fuck away from me!
[33:00.12]What the fuck?
[33:12.28]Oh my god, this sucks!
[33:14.58]This sucks!
[33:15.80]You little fucker!
[33:17.16]Get over here!
[33:22.05]Did I get it?
[33:23.13]I'm just gonna die too.
[33:26.49]This sucks.
[33:28.85]What is this?
[33:29.29]44 magnum ammo.
[33:32.51]I have no healing.
[33:34.31]This is a fucking disaster.
[33:44.14]God damn it!
[33:46.06]I hate these fucking bug rooms!
[33:56.05]Mother.
[33:58.06]I don't know.
[33:58.64]I don't know what to do about this.
[34:00.38]I really don't.
[34:02.64]She's upstairs.
[34:03.32]Don't go up.
[34:05.15]Okay.
[34:08.89]I gotta go through this door.
[34:13.17]I mean, can I kill this thing?
[34:16.82]If I shoot the brain enough times?
[34:19.68]Hey!
[34:45.72]Oh, fucking come on.
[34:49.34]Come on!
[34:50.53]Come on!
[34:51.53]What am I supposed to do about this shit?
[34:54.63]Just blow her fucking brains out!
[35:03.34]I'm just...
[35:13.46]What the fuck?
[35:15.43]Holy goodness.
[35:19.13]They put her right there?
[35:20.43]That sucks.
[35:25.07]She's the queen.
[35:27.89]I need to have the flamethrower?
[35:29.23]Where would I get- Oh, I gotta go out on the balcony, right?
[35:33.84]Mm-hmm.
[35:36.36]Out on the goddamn balcony where it was before in the dream sequence.
[35:45.27]Alright.
[35:47.97]She's the queen ant.
[35:55.41]The only answer is more alcohol.
[35:56.71]It's not very much.
[36:03.39]Wait, wait, wait, where am I?
[36:08.47]I gotta backtrack a little bit here.
[36:13.54]I need to go... I don't know where that balcony was.
[36:16.42]Not this way.
[36:17.12]Where's my healing?
[36:18.05]Alright, I still have a healing potion.
[36:22.29]I need to go out this way, right?
[36:23.51]Yeah, go back.
[36:24.37]I need to backtrack a little bit and just get the flamethrower and burn this shit.
[36:30.05]Where did I come from?
[36:31.17]Oh, fuck the coin.
[36:32.13]Whatever.
[36:33.41]So that was right there.
[36:35.74]Came out this way.
[36:36.60]Gosh darn it.
[36:40.06]Gosh darn it.
[36:42.59]You guys ever just want to say out loud, like, gosh darn it?
[36:45.63]Sometimes I do.
[36:47.37]She's gonna say, get out of here, you little shit!
[36:50.56]Yeah.
[36:56.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:04.01]Where the fuck even was I?
[37:05.81]I gotta go.
[37:09.51]I hate that it started me back here.
[37:15.25]Close this fucking door.
[37:19.10]What?
[37:21.00]Where the fuck do I need to go?
[37:22.98]How do I get back to where I was?
[37:24.44]Not that way.
[37:25.02]Can I shimmy over here?
[37:34.63]I'm kind of going the way I was before.
[37:36.03]Wait, let me just take a second here.
[37:43.60]to the left and then straight out.
[37:45.16]I don't think I can go that way.
[37:46.18]How did I get down here?
[37:47.78]That way, okay.
[37:51.94]I mean, is that door there?
[37:53.06]I'm just so turned around right now, yeah.
[38:00.83]No, go this way.
[38:04.17]Right here, right?
[38:06.25]Okay, I mean, is there a way for me to get up to the balcony from out here?
[38:10.82]I don't think so.
[38:11.54]I think I have to just go where I was going.
[38:22.23]What the fuck is going on?
[38:28.96]I'm so confused right now.
[38:30.62]I really am.
[38:35.16]I just, I'm so confused.
[38:37.76]I don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[38:38.96]I'm so turned around.
[38:39.75]I got a fucking VR helmet on my head.
[38:41.71]I don't even remember where it was.
[38:49.86]Search the old house for the ceremony.
[38:51.10]Back that way, and then... I don't know.
[38:58.47]Give me a hand here, guys.
[38:59.67]Because I seriously am so fucking lost right now.
[39:07.09]Is it in this house, or do I go back outside?
[39:08.87]Like, I don't want to just walk around aimlessly and make myself puke.
[39:15.59]Because I will puke.
[39:18.99]Too much whiskey?
[39:19.87]No, not even... What?
[39:22.85]Should have got the steroids.
[39:25.02]I mean, can I make it through those places?
[39:27.00]I don't know.
[39:28.04]Avoid mom and the bees.
[39:36.08]Well, I'm going to try to go through that again.
[39:38.06]We'll see what happens.
[39:38.72]It's in the house.
[39:42.42]Just got to run past the bugs.
[39:43.70]God damn it.
[39:44.32]I don't have much health.
[39:47.09]Like, that's all I got for health.
[39:51.81]I mean, I'll try it.
[39:52.71]I'll try.
[39:52.97]I'm just gonna, like, block and run.
[39:54.33]Let's see if I can do it.
[39:57.71]If I can go straight into the left, right?
[40:09.05]She's... Ah!
[40:09.65]Ah!
[40:11.23]Ah!
[40:20.50]Fuck!
[40:21.50]Get- Do something!
[40:22.54]DO SOMETHING!
[40:27.23]Will you fucking go somewhere, please?
[40:30.67]Is she shooting the bugs at me?
[40:34.03]She's-
[40:53.92]Fucking shit cock.
[40:58.54]I feel like there's something I'm doing fucking drastically wrong.
[41:09.17]So what, can I just run by her?
[41:10.55]She just stands there.
[41:11.35]I thought she was gonna fucking come after me.
[41:12.69]You fucking shit cock.
[41:18.40]You fucking shit cock.
[41:31.80]I feel like I need the flamethrower, but is the flamethrower back in the old house?
[41:37.80]Loading tips.
[41:38.84]Small insects are hard to hit with bullets.
[41:40.36]It's best to take them out on one.
[41:42.32]I didn't even see it.
[41:45.58]You're missing tips right now.
[41:47.12]Well, you guys are my tips.
[41:48.76]I don't care if you backseat at this point.
[41:50.52]I just want... Dude, with the VR helmet on and drinking whiskey, it's kind of hard for me to pay fucking any attention to what the fuck's going on.
[42:01.14]The game is, like, telling me right now.
[42:03.60]That was the right way.
[42:04.78]We're going for it.
[42:06.78]We're going all in.
[42:08.20]I'm running past her.
[42:10.60]Like, fuck this.
[42:11.52]You know what I'm saying?
[42:13.12]Hey, you can stay in there.
[42:15.49]Fuck out.
[42:16.35]You cock.
[42:17.47]Okay, sure thing.
[42:18.81]Let's just go.
[42:19.45]I'm running.
[42:20.35]I'm fucking sprinting by her.
[42:25.29]What?
[42:37.26]Let's go.
[42:38.20]Wait, what's that?
[42:39.89]That's the way out.
[42:40.75]But I want to see if I can just get by her.
[42:43.57]Let's go for it.
[42:44.71]What do I have?
[42:45.21]I got yellow health.
[42:46.11]And... Here we go!
[42:56.85]Go!
[42:56.95]Get out of the way!
[43:03.82]Get out of the way, you bitch!
[43:06.42]You bitch!
[43:07.64]You scary bitch!
[43:08.90]Alright, I'm good.
[43:09.68]No, I'm not!
[43:10.30]There's an egg sack!
[43:11.66]What did I just pick up?
[43:12.68]What's going on?
[43:13.18]I don't know where I'm going.
[43:15.70]I don't know.
[43:16.38]That door don't open.
[43:17.50]That door don't open.
[43:18.54]What about this one?
[43:19.58]What is that?
[43:19.92]I don't know what it is.
[43:23.50]I made it.
[43:24.18]Oh my god, there's egg sacks everywhere.
[43:33.72]Oh, my goodness.
[43:34.48]Oh, what's that?
[43:42.97]I don't have a fucking room.
[43:45.87]Oh, my God.
[43:46.43]Fucking just take them.
[43:47.15]I don't care.
[43:47.57]Give me that thing.
[43:51.09]Burn nozzle.
[43:52.06]Okay.
[43:53.58]Ah.
[43:54.56]For the love of God.
[43:56.42]Did I run by one?
[43:58.06]And how much dumb shit is in this inventory?
[44:11.35]broken handgun I don't know guys do I just fucking destroy something here so I trash like random stuff I need the bag upgrade get bigger pockets I know
[44:38.94]You broke sequence when you broke that hive and got the statue and now the bugs are active.
[44:42.78]Is that really what fucking happened?
[44:46.22]I broke sequence.
[44:51.41]God damn it.
[44:55.37]Did I like fuck up the whole game because I destroyed a hive?
[44:58.97]Why can I not get rid of this?
[45:04.80]I mean, I feel like I gotta have to get rid of something here.
[45:07.02]Like,
[45:08.84]Like, the supplements or something.
[45:10.38]I don't know.
[45:10.74]This is probably a mistake, but I need room for whatever the fuck else I need.
[45:14.94]You know what I'm saying?
[45:18.90]Like, that probably is not a great idea.
[45:20.54]I don't know if I fucked up.
[45:21.66]Who knows?
[45:22.42]I'm gonna have to take this out with a shotgun.
[45:26.87]Right?
[45:27.33]Because I don't have any other option at the moment.
[45:29.49]So, just shoot it with a shotgun.
[45:37.01]What do you mean, there you are?
[45:37.87]What are you talking about?
[45:38.67]What?
[45:38.87]What do you mean, there you are?
[45:40.65]Huh?
[45:46.98]Where is she?
[45:52.04]I don't understand.
[45:55.22]What does this want me to do?
[45:56.24]I don't have that thing that I need for this, apparently.
[46:07.34]Really?
[46:09.19]Really?
[46:09.47]No, don't do this to me.
[46:11.59]Don't.
[46:16.05]What was that?
[46:16.53]Let's check over here.
[46:22.72]I just want to see what's over here.
[46:32.64]Screwed lockpick.
[46:35.33]I don't...
[46:37.60]I can't use this right now.
[46:38.78]I need room for the flamethrower.
[46:44.36]Son of a bitch.
[46:53.31]Please go away.
[46:54.15]Okay, there's an item in there.
[46:56.85]Fucking hell.
[46:59.97]Come on now.
[47:00.67]Okay.
[47:08.38]I mean, can I just blow her fucking head off, like, a couple times?
[47:12.17]I don't know.
[47:12.57]I don't know, and she's got the stupid beehive as active, so how am I supposed to do anything?
[47:16.79]Okay.
[47:37.72]Get out of my fucking way good.
[47:39.90]Let's go come on.
[47:41.90]Let's go I'm so fucked right now like what am I supposed to do?
[48:03.45]I Don't know what I'm supposed to do
[48:20.03]What the fuck am I supposed to do right now?
[48:29.53]Am I gonna have to load the original save to not have this happen?
[48:36.00]I'm gonna die.
[48:53.60]I mean, I feel like this shit shouldn't be happening right now.
[48:59.19]I'm just gonna die.
[48:59.95]Just fucking kill me.
[49:03.07]Something went, like, horribly wrong.
[49:17.83]Go to the balcony, rewind, go back in there.
[49:24.88]That guy was talking shit with those flying groups next.
[49:27.12]There's a door you haven't been to?
[49:32.48]Let me just look at it then.
[49:33.88]Hold on.
[49:37.40]Like, where's the place I haven't been?
[49:43.25]The place I haven't been is... That's the only door I haven't gone in.
[49:49.55]I feel like there's a piece of the flamethrower in there, but... Like, I can't be in that room.
[49:53.64]Because the bugs just fucking kill you.
[49:57.78]And she's in the next room over.
[50:01.16]Somebody told me that I fucked up the whole thing because I shot the egg sack.
[50:09.38]Yeah, I'm gonna reload the save.
[50:11.68]I'm gonna reload and dump a bunch of shit in the chest.
[50:14.79]Go down that hall.
[50:16.79]Like this one here.
[50:27.41]I'm just getting so lost because I feel like I'm missing something.
[50:32.89]Down the hall where she was standing before.
[50:34.25]I think I just need the flamethrower or something.
[50:38.74]I didn't fuck it up.
[50:39.38]They were just lying.
[50:45.10]I mean, there's that right there.
[50:47.38]I'm going to go up and then left.
[50:49.47]Let's see what happens.
[50:50.45]Hold on.
[50:55.60]through that door, but can I even go in there?
[50:57.36]I'm gonna probably die, but there's the one place I didn't go.
[50:59.50]It's right here and then left, right?
[51:05.62]So this way and then that way.
[51:06.99]Of course she's right fucking here.
[51:13.19]Come on, go the other way.
[51:14.23]Go this way, please.
[51:17.45]Get out of here.
[51:18.17]This is not big enough for me to hide here.
[51:20.84]This is a tiny little box.
[51:21.80]She's gonna see me.
[51:23.24]She's gonna know I'm right here.
[51:24.80]Hi, ma.
[51:31.94]Ah!
[51:32.08]I don't know what that is.

[58:28.28]Even after what happened to Evelyn, you must... You just keep talking about some strange medicine.
[58:33.19]And what are you planning to do with my altar?
[58:34.97]You better keep those sticky fingers off of it.
[58:37.01]Nobody touches my sacred altar.
[58:39.96]You think your father and I are idiots?
[58:41.88]Stupid!
[58:42.60]You spoiled, pathetic child.
[58:44.16]I wish you would... I wish you'd never been born.
[58:47.85]Unforgivable, undeniable, irreplaceable, indescribable, pathetic.
[58:54.23]Yet always looking down on us and trying to leave our home.
[58:57.77]After everything we've done for you, pathetic.
[58:59.89]Pathetic, apathetic, pathetic.
[59:02.68]If you ever even touch my altar, I'll slice off your chest and serve it up as pot roast.
[59:10.35]Undeniable, irreplaceable.
[59:14.42]Irredeemable, undeniable.
[59:16.92]I can't even go through the bird door?
[59:22.08]Oh my fucking god.
[59:26.81]Well, back to the dining room.
[59:33.87]What's this?
[59:36.41]What's this fucking undeniable, irreplaceable, irredeemable thing?

[61:02.59]What's that?
[61:03.55]Oh.
[61:04.95]It's just a bug, don't worry.
[61:06.43]Nobody freak out.
[61:08.15]Nobody freak out.
[61:10.33]I'm just gonna get him.
[61:16.33]I thought that was a giant fucking snake.
[61:22.71]It was a giant snake, and I was about to fucking scream.
[61:26.24]No, it's just a dryer vent.
[61:27.52]It's okay, guys.
[61:28.82]Just a dryer vent.
[61:30.36]Thought it was a fucking python.
[61:38.24]Really, I'm gonna... What the fuck over here?
[61:47.13]Alright, let's do it.
[61:48.07]I need to save, too.
[61:58.64]I really want to save.
[62:00.16]Where's my save point?
[62:01.04]Back here?
[62:01.46]Yeah, I'm saving.
[62:02.90]I'm saving it.
[62:09.27]I'm saving it, dudes.
[62:13.25]I ain't fucking around right now.
[62:15.37]You want me to fuck around?
[62:16.59]Not even close.
[62:21.25]Yeah, I want to save.
[62:23.25]I'm so terrified of screwing this whole thing up.
[62:27.59]Look at all these fucking bugs.
[62:30.85]It's disgusting.
[62:39.42]Oh my god, what is it?
[62:40.16]A giant snake?
[62:42.80]Oh, it's one of those white snakes!
[62:47.26]From, like, the Amazon!
[62:50.08]Okay, I'm gonna go there.
[62:52.82]Yeah, I wanna be safe, then sorry, you know what I mean?
[62:56.06]I wanna be safe, then I wanna be sorry.
[63:00.81]Because I'm gonna die, so I'll be safe, but then I'll be sorry.
[63:06.01]I can probably store something, too.
[63:09.62]Um... I'm gonna store this shit.
[63:15.20]I don't fucking care about that.
[63:16.82]Who cares?
[63:18.42]Shotgun ammo.
[63:19.16]I could load the shotgun a little bit.
[63:20.62]Handgun.
[63:21.20]Oh, that's okay.
[63:25.57]That's okay.
[63:26.09]Wait, what?
[63:27.13]Oh, there is only three.
[63:28.45]Three, three.
[63:29.01]Oh, that's handgun ammo.

[63:32.33]Okay.
[63:35.67]Save it.
[63:35.91]Let's get a save here.
[63:37.67]Come up for air.
[63:41.74]No jokes?
[63:43.40]Why am I not allowed to tell any jokes?
[63:45.84]I like telling jokes.
[63:48.98]Save nipple.
[63:56.37]Ah, Amazon Prime.
[63:57.73]What?
[63:59.41]Alright, just coming up for air.
[64:00.67]Coming up for a little bit more of this, you know, Jack Daniels.
[64:03.17]Coming up for a little bit more Jack Daniels.
[64:04.63]No, this is not Jack Daniels.
[64:06.26]This is Johnny Walker.
[64:08.34]Johnny Walker, there you go.
[64:09.82]Do you want to see?
[64:10.28]There you go.
[64:13.72]I don't drink often.
[64:15.96]But I do when I get fucking scared.
[64:21.33]Give me a second.
[64:24.43]Holy shit.
[64:26.49]My hair is kind of going all over the place.
[64:29.09]Coming up for alcohol?
[64:31.05]Coming up for alcohol.
[64:33.36]No.
[64:35.42]Not even Jack Daniels.
[64:39.90]Drunk in public.
[64:42.28]What are you talking about?
[64:43.94]It takes more than that to get me drunk.
[64:46.60]He won't see this message.
[64:47.52]If he does, I donate $5,000.
[64:49.44]Well... I saw the message.
[64:54.76]You don't have to give me $5,000, though.
[64:55.88]Don't worry.
[64:56.96]I don't even have notifications on.
[64:59.66]Don't be a drunkard.
[65:01.18]Don't worry.
[65:02.38]You'll be fine.
[65:03.22]Your hair is coming out.
[65:04.22]Well, it's because this fucking thing is pressing directly into my forehead.
[65:10.08]I didn't even take the drink I wanted, either.
[65:11.98]Where is it?
[65:18.53]Hey.
[65:19.71]21 plus?
[65:20.01]21, no, 22 and over?
[65:29.65]Ew.
[65:32.28]It's not bad.
[65:36.37]I do like Johnny Walker, though.
[65:38.41]If I'm going to drink, ever, it's gonna be Johnny Walker.
[65:45.15]Because I'm a fucking snob.
[65:46.55]Alright, let's go.
[65:48.37]What was I doing?
[65:52.13]Everything in moderation, guys.
[65:53.99]Don't do it too much.
[65:54.81]Don't do it, you know... Have some fun.
[65:57.98]Don't go overboard.
[65:58.78]Don't do anything dumb.
[66:02.80]Be smart.
[66:03.34]Don't be a fucking idiot.
[66:06.23]Alright, what was I doing?
[66:08.61]I say that as I'm being like a fucking idiot.
[66:10.95]Examine the altar on the second floor.
[66:17.51]I kind of don't even remember what the fuck I was doing.
[66:22.51]I do want to go... I want to burn some shit because I want to go in this dining room.
[66:32.06]What's that?
[66:33.22]There's an exclamation point in the dining room.
[66:36.29]I kind of want to see what it is.
[66:43.46]Now that I... Is that her?
[66:45.64]Is she the exclamation?
[66:46.66]I'm just going to burn her.
[66:47.22]I want to see what happens.
[66:48.14]I'm curious.
[66:56.93]Burn!
[67:00.51]What?
[67:02.41]What?
[67:13.67]Is she dead?
[67:14.61]She's dead, right?
[67:15.41]She's, like, gone for now?
[67:18.21]Okay, what the fuck was even in here?
[67:24.12]Was that a waste?
[67:24.70]Was that a waste?
[67:26.00]Should I just fucking do it again?
[67:27.76]I think that might have been a waste.
[67:29.38]What?
[67:31.96]It was probably a waste.
[67:33.68]If anything was in here that was worth taking...
[67:36.99]Then whatever.
[67:38.44]And it turns out that I needed to fucking bring like a goddamn pick here.
[67:42.78]What?
[67:43.96]Go off.
[67:46.34]Is there something in here that I need?
[67:54.70]Maybe not.
[67:56.26]So that was not even worth doing.
[67:57.74]I just want to make sure.
[67:58.46]I'm going to reload that save, guys.
[68:05.96]Reload and save.
[68:06.64]None of this matters.
[68:12.62]Ow.
[68:13.40]Ow.
[68:14.28]Ow.
[68:17.03]I'm going to go back the other way.
[68:20.63]Kill me.
[68:21.99]Kill me.
[68:23.51]Kill me.
[68:24.39]Just kill me.
[68:24.84]Do you know how many grenades I can throw at the ground?
[68:27.72]Because I'm not going to do that again.
[68:30.84]Kill me.
[68:32.18]Just kill me.
[68:34.24]Not much longer.
[68:35.25]Just kill me.
[68:39.49]Take me.
[68:40.17]Let's go.
[68:42.75]Yeah.
[68:44.43]Any second now.
[68:45.25]Just kill me.
[68:48.99]How come when I'm trying to die, they won't kill me, but when I'm running away, I die fucking instantly?
[68:59.28]Kill me.
[69:00.98]Kill me.
[69:04.00]Why is this taking so long?
[69:05.44]Remember the last time I died to these fucking things?
[69:09.70]It happened in like three hits.
[69:17.04]What the fuck?
[69:27.40]Why is this taking so long?
[69:33.79]Remember how fucking fast I died the last time?
[70:01.02]I don't have any words for that shit.
[70:03.00]I really don't.
[70:05.80]When I don't want to die, I die in fucking five hits, and when I do want to die, they don't kill me, and I'm invincible.
[70:12.73]What the fuck?
[70:14.87]That was interesting, to say the least.
[70:17.23]Okay.
[70:19.59]Let's go.
[70:19.91]Let's do what I was going to do.
[70:21.05]We don't need to go there, but what was that?
[70:23.41]Nothing important.
[70:24.05]Okay.
[70:32.00]Yada, yada, yada.
[70:32.62]Let's see if we can now go back.
[70:34.78]I just wanted to do that to make sure I could... In case I needed something there, but I don't think I do.
[70:39.79]I got everything I need.
[70:41.61]Why... What's going black?
[70:43.39]What's going on?
[70:49.77]Can you turn this way, please?
[70:59.27]Nice cufflinks, man.
[71:02.16]Excellent.
[71:02.88]No, I wanted to go back because I wanted to do the bridge.
[71:06.32]But I think I can get there from here, can't I?
[71:09.51]Yeah, right there.
[71:11.37]So, if I go down... Okay, this will be fine.
[71:17.59]That's a bird door.
[71:18.53]We don't have a bird key.
[71:19.43]Gonna take out the flamethrower just in case we see any bugs.
[71:25.37]We want to get to, so let's go left and then up.
[71:30.25]Okay.
[71:31.21]I actually was going the right way, but I wasted a lot of ammo.
[71:33.86]Alright, let's go this way.
[71:40.64]Actually, I'm going to just go like this.
[71:46.14]Just to get them off my back.
[71:47.30]Make sure she's nowhere to be found.
[71:52.35]Let's go up.
[71:59.06]Okay.
[72:08.65]Mommy.
[72:12.57]I gotta go this way.
[72:34.86]What?
[72:35.66]It's okay.
[72:41.38]That's okay.
[72:42.72]That's okay.
[72:44.66]Ah!

[72:51.91]Where'd he go?
[72:54.21]Stop this madness.
[72:56.51]Stop this madness.
[72:57.69]Okay.
[72:58.47]Stop this fucking madness.
[73:05.90]He's already dead.
[73:07.86]Crane in there.
[73:08.57]Let's get this up and see what the fuck's in this room.
[73:12.97]Right.
[73:20.46]I got the shotgun ready.
[73:21.44]In case there's a fucking guy right here, he's dead.
[73:25.64]Oh, there's a treasure chest.
[73:28.02]What's inside the... Okay, there's the crow key.
[73:31.93]I know what to do with that.
[73:32.89]Now, burner fuel.
[73:34.81]Coin.
[73:35.13]I can go in the crow door now.
[73:40.09]Which was back there.
[73:42.37]I got 200 ammo.
[73:42.89]Let's reload this thing.
[73:43.83]Okay.
[73:48.81]That crow door is...
[73:52.69]There so it's gonna make it this way straight down.
[73:55.35]I got her I killed her Hopefully she's not back in action.
[73:59.56]Otherwise, it'll be a big deal Big fucking deal.
[74:03.14]Let's go ahead and say There's no save here.
[74:05.92]Is there?
[74:07.34]Not that I remember.
[74:08.08]I don't think so Hey guys, oh Didn't see that when it was here I don't have any chem fluid that's okay That's okay
[74:23.96]We reloaded on all the guns?
[74:25.38]Yeah, we are.
[74:26.14]Alright, let's go.
[74:29.46]Let's go put the crow key in the crow door.
[74:31.86]Call it a day.
[74:32.92]Well, no, no, no, not call it a day, you know, but... Figuratively spleeking, spleeking, figuratively spleeking, I'm drunk.
[74:42.82]Um... There, so we're gonna go down, wrap around, you got it.
[74:49.18]Can I go that way?
[74:50.20]Oh, hey, hey, hey!
[75:00.97]Down, down.
[75:04.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[75:08.47]Yes, sir.
[75:09.17]Here we are.
[75:14.11]Straight ahead.
[75:16.43]Crow key.
[75:20.22]Let's reload this just in case there's some person.
[75:31.24]God damn it I don't know where to go
[76:02.93]Can I climb up?
[76:05.51]She's on fire.
[76:06.13]She's on fire.
[76:13.74]Oh, that fucking hurt my body.
[76:16.42]My whole body hurts.
[76:30.11]Whoa!
[76:31.19]Burn her!
[76:33.17]Get out!
[76:33.65]Get out!
[76:34.01]Get out!
[76:34.29]Get out!
[76:34.53]Get out!
[76:34.73]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[76:40.63]That was fucking horrible.
[76:42.47]Huh?
[76:43.19]Where am I going?
[76:43.58]No, no, no, no!
[76:44.02]Don't go back!
[76:44.42]Don't go back down!
[76:50.78]Open the door!
[76:54.12]Open the fucking door!
[77:06.39]Serum?
[77:13.01]Jesus criminy.
[77:15.91]Oh, dear.
[77:18.55]Regarding the series serum, the following items be able to synthesize serum.
[77:22.83]D-series cranial nerve, D-series peripheral nerve.
[77:27.64]I think that's it.
[77:30.46]What?
[77:38.94]Okay, what?
[77:45.31]God.
[77:46.77]That fucking seriously.
[77:47.95]I need a drink after that.
[77:48.83]Bullshit.
[77:49.27]Jesus.
[77:49.61]Okay.
[78:13.78]It's okay, sorry it's just my hand it was just my hand not a big deal don't worry about it
[78:42.98]Ayayay.
[78:46.59]Spooked by yourself.
[78:47.93]Yeah, that's what happened.
[78:50.71]Drink more?
[78:51.51]No.
[78:52.71]I'm not gonna drink more.
[78:54.69]Sweat check?
[78:58.27]Pretty bad.
[78:59.81]Pretty bad.
[79:02.61]Ugh.
[79:07.07]This fucking game, man.
[79:08.15]I swear to god.
[79:14.39]I'm more scared of myself than I am the game.
[79:15.81]That's probably true.
[79:16.59]Give me a second.
[79:19.21]I need like two seconds after that one.
[79:22.55]I feel like I have like fucking Ghostbusters ecto goggles on.
[79:28.46]The thing is after a while it kind of feels like it's hard to describe.
[79:36.36]I feel like I've been walking around but I haven't.
[79:40.52]I'm still sitting in my fucking chair.
[79:43.39]I haven't gone anywhere.
[79:46.84]Whatever.
[79:48.70]I feel like I've taken, like, a hike.
[79:52.40]Let me move this down.
[79:53.14]Hold on.
[79:56.36]I'm more scared of Jerma.
[79:59.54]I need a second.
[80:00.26]That last, like, huge jump scare with that lady was... Are the goggles heavy?
[80:04.14]They kind of are.
[80:06.86]They really, like, kind of... The strap helps, but it really puts, like, a lot of pressure, like, here.
[80:14.30]So after, like, every, like, 10 or 15 minutes or so, I kind of have to get some air.
[80:20.54]But it's okay.
[80:23.63]I'm such a brave boy.
[80:24.65]Yeah, the future is now.
[80:28.37]I'm having a bunch of fun, though.
[80:29.39]This is, like, a lot of fun.
[80:33.71]So, mercy to get worn out from doing nothing.
[80:36.65]Well, it doesn't help that the, uh...
[80:39.33]That it, like, is stimulating areas of my brain that haven't been stimulated in a long time.
[80:47.78]That might... Holy shit, I almost just ended the stream.
[80:51.00]I almost just clicked the fucking button to end the stream.
[80:55.60]I was like, ah, click the X, whatever, fuck it.
[80:58.54]Who gives a shit, right?
[80:59.63]No.
[81:02.17]It's definitely fun.
[81:04.43]I don't know if it's...
[81:06.86]better than like a Vive or like a fucking Oculus because besides like Resident Evil 7 I'm not sure how much there is to do in this fucking thing without Resident Evil 7 I don't know I really don't I really don't know it feels like there's not very much to do with the PSVR besides play this game at the moment so whatever
[81:34.61]too drunk.
[81:35.37]I'm not even drunk.
[81:37.35]I won't be till that bottle is gone.
[81:43.03]Okay, let's go.
[81:43.83]I've got enough air.
[81:47.65]Dermot's scaring me with end stream, but it was an accident.
[81:50.25]I would've came right back.
[81:51.71]But we're not ending.
[81:52.33]We're good.
[81:54.71]Alright, let's get back underneath.
[81:58.95]Let's go!
[82:02.08]Sometimes you need a second, though.
[82:04.37]To make sure that things are still real.
[82:06.15]Let me readjust this shit.
[82:10.67]Sorry if this looks weird or feels weird to you guys, but... I wish I could, like, push this down further.
[82:17.32]I can't.
[82:22.24]I wish I could stay right there.
[82:25.06]Did I go... I got a fucking misshaped head.
[82:26.80]I got such a tiny, misshaped head.
[82:30.04]The PSVR was not designed for my, like, tiny little fucking peanut head.
[82:36.37]There we are, okay, no, it's still fucked up, here we go.
[82:49.08]Right there.
[82:51.88]Right there, okay.
[82:59.58]Create the serum, find the serum ingredients.
[83:03.01]For the love of God, how the fuck am I supposed to know what that is?
[83:07.07]D-Series cranial nerve, peripheral nerve.
[83:09.13]How the fuck am I supposed to know what that is?
[83:23.87]Little doll.
[83:27.89]Anything on the crotch?
[83:29.59]Anything on the crotch?
[83:30.84]Nope.
[83:33.18]Oh, a piano.
[83:35.52]My ears have been ringing all day and I haven't been able to sleep since the child showed up.
[83:39.60]It's like Zoe says.
[83:41.10]There's something strange about the child and the woman she brought with her.
[83:45.91]I'm seeing things, hearing things.
[83:47.09]Can't stop feeling nauseous.
[83:48.15]I went to see the doctor in town and he gave me an x-ray.
[83:50.99]What's happening to me?
[83:52.67]The child gave me a present.
[83:54.87]I put the present in the secret room right at the back of the second floor where nobody will find it.
[84:02.06]That arm is a sign of the child's trust.
[84:04.32]That arm will lead us to happiness.
[84:06.67]And anyone who corrupts that happiness, I won't allow them to live.
[84:11.53]Secret room right at the back of the second floor.
[84:16.91]Okay.
[84:19.85]You got it.
[84:21.77]You fucking wanker.
[84:23.33]Alright, let's go.
[84:28.24]I'm just waiting to see like a fucking old lady come up with a Satan face.
[84:33.62]I'm preparing for the Satan face, I am.
[84:36.80]What is this?
[84:43.21]What do I need?
[84:52.98]Shit.
[84:56.60]Fuck, what do I need there?
[84:57.68]A lantern?
[84:58.18]Do I need to kill her and get the lantern?
[85:01.06]The scale and the door seem to be connected.
[85:02.84]No shit.
[85:13.02]Oh, a coin.
[85:15.02]Antique coin.
[85:20.46]Chat, what do I do?
[85:25.46]Just the best Satan face.
[85:30.53]Oh, I gotta go with the fucking lantern, I think.
[85:33.60]Where did she die?
[85:34.40]Hi!
[85:35.00]Hi!
[85:35.06]Hi!
[85:41.64]How high can I go?
[85:42.28]What do you think?
[85:46.55]I just did, like, chandelier by Sia.
[85:49.79]On the chandelier.
[85:51.83]Hey, old lady!
[86:00.71]Can I have that?
[86:07.57]Where'd she go?
[86:09.01]Where did she... I hate that song.
[86:17.51]I don't think I've ever heard that song start to finish.
[86:21.27]Where the fuck did it go?
[86:22.75]What the fuck?
[86:23.25]Who are you?
[86:23.81]Who, who, who?
[86:24.75]What the fuck is that spider person?
[86:27.56]That's special.
[86:28.28]Where'd the fucking lantern go?
[86:30.77]God damn it.
[86:31.57]I gotta follow this stupid spider lady with 31 HP.
[86:37.86]Oh, shotgun.
[86:38.78]Fuck this.
[86:39.22]I'm blowing her fucking head off.
[86:42.18]I'm getting ready for a jump scare.
[86:43.32]I'm getting ready.
[86:44.26]She's gonna be right here.
[86:44.96]The spider fucking person's gonna be right here.
[86:52.36]Damn it.
[86:55.66]Where did I go?
[86:56.58]This way.
[86:56.92]Re-center.
[86:57.91]Re-center.
[87:01.25]me.
[87:02.37]I'm not ready for this shit.
[87:03.69]Please, not right here.
[87:07.09]It's gonna be right at the top of the ladder.
[87:08.69]Huh?
[87:22.30]What happened?
[87:24.30]Wait.
[87:25.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[87:27.00]What happened?
[87:34.24]Treasure photo.
[87:35.48]Somewhere in a fucking toilet.
[87:36.60]Who cares?
[87:53.52]Hey!
[87:53.70]What is that?
[87:55.66]Blue chem?
[87:56.30]Separating agent?
[87:56.82]I don't know what that is.
[87:57.54]Give me that thing!
[87:58.08]I don't know...
[88:04.28]What'd I do?
[88:07.48]No, put that back together.
[88:09.52]I don't know what that did.
[88:10.34]That's the first time I've ever seen that.
[88:12.74]Fuel.
[88:13.14]Fuck.
[88:16.31]Nah.
[88:17.07]Oh.
[88:18.19]I didn't know what it did.
[88:19.89]I didn't know what that did.
[88:20.83]What's in the fucking box?
[88:25.37]You know what?
[88:26.95]Delete this.
[88:27.69]I don't care about a fucking treasure run.
[88:33.64]Hello?
[88:36.18]Hello?
[88:36.48]Are you there?
[88:44.89]Hello?
[88:45.27]Hello?
[88:45.83]Hi?
[88:46.23]Yeah?
[88:47.03]Who's that?
[88:47.31]Is anybody there?
[88:49.27]What's the matter?
[88:50.01]You okay?
[88:52.37]You need a...
[89:10.46]Fuck, I don't want to go down here.
[89:13.00]Save nipple.
[89:13.78]You know what that means.
[89:14.87]It's so fucking dark in here.
[89:28.11]What's up?
[89:46.26]This sucks.
[89:47.16]I'm so scared.
[89:48.32]She's gonna fucking come out of nowhere.
[89:52.42]Spider person.
[89:59.78]Can I just pick up shotgun shells?
[90:05.90]A tiny little core line door.
[90:09.13]What's in the core line door?
[90:12.52]You gonna sew buttons on my face, Mom?
[90:20.04]You know, we're talking comedy.
[90:22.40]You know, sometimes we gotta talk comedy because we're scared.
[90:30.37]Sometimes you talk just a little bit of comedy to make it so you don't
[90:44.27]Kind of out of room here.
[90:49.79]Shit.
[90:57.80]Excuse me, I just wanted to ask for directions on how to get the fuck out of this game.
[91:06.50]Shotgun shells.
[91:09.48]And that's strong chem fluid.
[91:10.88]Okay, I need to make some room.
[91:16.35]Handgun ammo, just get out of here.
[91:22.41]What do I do?
[91:23.73]Another healing potion, for sure.
[91:27.02]Dude!
[91:35.57]No fucking, I was trying to close the menu.
[91:38.39]Come on!
[91:58.45]Unbelievable.
[92:00.50]Un-fucking-believable.
[92:01.42]I want to close the menu and I hit like the accidental triangle square.
[92:05.38]Whatever the fuck it was.
[92:08.22]I'm so angry right now.
[92:10.94]I'm actually fucking angry.
[92:14.15]What a joke.
[92:17.25]Not a fucking joke.
[92:18.29]Well, I got full health now, guys.
[92:19.75]Great.
[92:28.05]That's so annoying.
[92:34.22]So fucking irritated right now.
[92:35.72]I can't believe I just did that shit.
[92:46.09]I'm just so anxious and so amped up.
[92:54.26]Un-fucking-believable, undeniable, irredeemable, irreplaceable.
[93:08.89]Wish I had that health!
[93:10.47]Wish I had the health!
[93:30.90]What the fuck?
[93:31.58]She's like 10 feet tall.
[93:33.06]Why is she so huge?
[93:36.88]Why is she 10 feet tall?
[93:38.60]Why are you 10 feet tall?
[93:49.55]Why is she so big?
[94:03.96]Don't do it.
[94:06.00]Don't do it.
[94:07.12]Don't do it.
[94:07.78]Just wait.
[94:08.86]Just wait a minute.
[94:11.12]Don't do it.
[94:11.62]Just wait a minute.
[94:12.34]Wait a minute.
[94:12.80]Wait a minute.
[94:13.40]Wait just a minute.
[94:16.82]Fuck.
[94:18.02]Oh, fuck.
[94:18.74]Oh, fuck.
[94:19.28]Where is she?
[94:20.40]I'm so scared.
[94:28.32]I don't know where to go.
[94:30.99]Don't know what to do.
[94:31.77]This way?
[94:34.49]What happened?
[94:37.68]How much health do I have?
[94:59.29]Am I alright?
[95:06.35]Whoa, lady.
[95:08.25]Lady.
[95:09.85]What's my way of health?
[95:11.65]Am I okay?
[95:21.63]Where did I end up?
[95:22.63]I'm like in a...
[95:46.89]I could have healed.
[95:48.00]Hopefully that puts me back where I... Fuck me.
[95:57.46]Do I at least get the health pack again?
[95:58.78]I think I do.
[96:03.02]Thank God.
[96:05.10]Don't fuck that up again.
[96:06.48]Holy goodness.
[96:10.45]I don't think I have enough ammo to kill this lady.
[96:17.31]It's too much.
[96:19.59]It's so scary.
[96:20.79]Alright, where was it?
[96:25.02]Where was it?
[96:26.42]Did I miss it?
[96:27.02]I don't think I did.
[96:29.12]I don't remember.
[96:31.26]I'm so fucking high strung right now.
[96:35.22]You just could... I am like a piece of thread that you would just rip the fuck up.
[96:41.30]You know what I'm saying?
[96:42.04]Fucking virtual reality.
[96:50.86]Oh my god, I'm so on edge.
[96:52.80]It's so hard for me to do anything.
[96:54.28]I'm so sorry.
[96:56.05]It really is.
[96:56.87]It's like snakes.
[96:57.97]It's fucking snakes.
[97:03.57]I'm so sorry, guys.
[97:04.80]I'm still coming down from that one.
[97:07.74]I think it was over here.
[97:16.23]Right, lock me to the side.
[97:17.69]There's the... I can't take it.
[97:19.13]I don't want it.
[97:19.79]Is it this way and here?
[97:24.95]Yeah, there it is.
[97:30.90]Okay, don't fuck this up now.
[97:34.42]Get the hand out of the way.
[97:39.00]Burner fuel.
[97:39.62]Oh, I don't know.
[97:48.00]Gunpowder.
[97:49.21]Solid fuel.
[97:52.03]I don't know what to do here.
[97:57.15]I guess I'll just get rid of the burner fuel.
[97:59.69]Get rid of the burner fuel.
[98:02.16]I got money.
[98:04.60]Get your fucking hands out of the way.
[98:06.72]Get your hand out of the fucking way.
[98:13.04]Thank you.
[98:16.53]Okay.
[98:16.89]Don't take it.
[98:27.07]3, 13, 136.
[98:30.68]Can't take them.
[98:44.13]I'd rather have the shotgun shells, I really would.
[98:47.49]Okay, here we go.
[98:49.09]Let's do it again.
[98:49.73]This time with health.
[98:51.11]How much health do I have?
[98:54.90]It was easy to see that.
[98:57.19]Alright, here we go.
[98:58.09]Let's do it again.
[98:58.59]Hi, lady.
[99:01.01]Please don't fucking kill me.
[99:02.63]She's gonna be right there.
[99:04.39]Hey!
[99:06.39]I didn't even know it was gonna happen.
[99:17.32]Let's go.
[99:17.76]Come on.
[99:18.48]Come on!
[99:19.84]Come on!
[99:21.24]I'm ready for you.
[99:22.04]I'm ready for you.
[99:23.40]Don't look up.
[99:24.58]Don't think I'm going to, sweety!
[99:25.80]Burn!
[99:42.13]Burn, you witch!
[99:54.76]Hooray!
[99:56.02]Huh?
[99:56.60]What's going on?
[99:57.98]Get back up there, you... Get... What am I tangled on?
[100:02.11]What am I tangled on?
[100:07.27]Uh-oh.
[100:26.27]My health.
[100:27.23]Potion!
[100:31.18]Oh, I'm like ripping into something.
[100:34.30]Okay, hold on.
[100:35.02]I need to... What am I caught on?
[100:37.82]I'm caught on something!
[100:39.40]I'm caught on something!
[100:42.58]Where did I go?
[100:43.32]I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[100:45.62]What's that?
[100:46.62]Handgun ammo.
[100:48.74]What was that?
[100:49.44]Burner?
[100:50.24]Burner fuel.
[100:51.30]Reload.
[100:54.44]I don't know.
[100:54.92]I don't know.
[100:55.46]I don't know.
[100:55.90]I don't know.
[100:56.34]What's that?
[100:57.34]What's this?
[100:58.02]What's that?
[101:01.63]Hey!

[135:57.12]You can't see shit.
[135:58.24]Don't worry.
[136:00.86]Alright, let's do it.
[136:03.98]Wrong ears?
[136:08.23]No, these are right.
[136:08.79]These are correct.
[136:12.39]These are right.
[136:15.83]Going back down.
[136:17.64]Let's go to the dissection room.
[136:21.18]And... Here we go.
[136:23.44]Actually, I kind of want... No, this is okay.
[136:30.30]Hey.
[136:31.34]21 and older?
[136:33.30]Bottoms up.
[136:33.68]21 and older.
[136:36.10]Unless you're from a country that allows 18.
[136:39.80]18 and older.
[136:40.74]If you're from a country that allows it. 21.
[136:48.37]2-1.
[136:52.23]I keep hitting my fucking nose.
[136:55.55]Alright.
[136:56.89]Back to it.
[136:59.55]Let's go.
[137:00.09]Wait, is my mic muted?
[137:01.31]No.
[137:04.21]We're good.
[137:06.35]Much love.
[137:06.73]Let's keep going.
[137:08.77]I don't have any more videotapes.
[137:12.61]Let's just go to the dissection room.
[137:14.35]Which is in this house.
[137:18.71]Bullet's in there.
[137:19.81]Okay.
[137:22.79]Make sure... I've got plenty of fuel.
[137:25.27]Okay.
[137:25.77]Let's keep going.
[137:30.74]Good luck.
[137:34.58]Dissection room is... down.
[137:38.79]I think it's in here.
[137:41.79]I've got to go down from here.
[137:54.82]It's that door.
[137:57.28]Just making sure.
[138:05.32]Okay.
[138:05.48]Where's the old lady?
[138:18.87]Wasn't the old lady right there?
[138:34.33]What does that say?
[138:39.43]What is that?
[138:40.77]What is that?
[138:49.32]Fuck it.
[138:53.02]Can't open it.
[138:54.82]I will like burp though.
[139:00.67]Oh!
[139:01.90]Maggots, that's gross.
[139:07.37]Wait, is there, can I shake the maggots out?
[139:09.35]No, okay.
[139:23.03]I gotta go down.
[139:23.61]Ooh, bird, bird key.
[139:28.53]Can use that in here.
[139:33.68]What is that?
[139:34.66]What is this stuff?
[139:37.13]What is that grenade launcher?
[139:39.19]How do I put this in the right spot I
[140:04.75]Can I hold the button down?
[140:17.22]Yeah, there we go.
[140:19.14]Damn, okay, I have one shot with this.
[140:21.04]Don't fuck that up.
[140:25.89]Flame rounds.
[140:28.09]Nice.
[140:29.93]Well, that's good to have, I think, right?
[140:35.36]Okay, now I have two shots.
[140:38.12]Shotgun.
[140:39.48]Handgun.
[140:40.14]Knife.
[140:41.36]Flamethrower.
[140:42.68]You know, I'm gonna put... I'm gonna move this.
[140:47.30]For now, because the flamethrower was good.
[140:48.94]And I don't see a need for it at the moment.
[140:52.96]Gunpowder.
[140:53.54]I think I'm okay.
[141:04.25]I think I'm okay.
[141:06.90]I could store this.
[141:07.78]It's alright.
[141:08.82]Whatever.
[141:15.48]Whatever.
[141:17.66]I'm glad I got the grenade launcher, though.
[141:19.00]That's pretty sick.
[141:22.56]What about in here?
[141:31.95]No.
[141:32.15]Let's go back.
[141:34.78]That just brings us back to the other area.
[141:36.56]It's okay.
[141:40.42]And you get down to the dissection room.
[141:42.34]So we gotta go down.
[141:49.26]Which is down here, right?
[141:52.05]This way.
[141:52.57]Oh, I gotta fucking play in the piano.
[141:58.91]And it's down.
[142:03.75]Yeah, it's down here.
[142:16.50]Where am I?
[142:22.42]Fuck.
[142:25.72]Flamethrower best weapon in the game.
[142:33.75]Don't fuck with the flamethrower, dude.
[142:36.59]You'll get burnt.
[142:37.89]You'll get burnt.
[142:41.01]I'm ready to hold R2 on some motherfucker, guys.
[142:43.62]I swear to God.
[142:45.48]I swear to God.
[142:47.03]I will hold R2 on the next motherfucker that shows it.
[142:49.74]Face this lady!
[142:55.84]What is with you fucking old... What is with you?
[143:01.80]Why are you like this?
[143:03.84]Stop being like that.
[143:09.54]Don't be like that, lady.
[143:11.54]Dissection room.
[143:13.18]Okay, here we go.
[143:21.61]Okay.
[143:25.79]I don't see anything in here.
[143:32.51]I'm so ready to light a motherfucker up right now.
[143:38.29]I will light a motherfucker up right now.
[143:42.40]I don't care.
[143:42.86]You guys might be mad that... Light him up!
[143:48.78]Light him up!
[143:52.80]Light him up!
[143:54.49]Light him up!
[143:57.03]Light him up!
[144:26.70]Going back in.
[144:29.86]Fucking flamethrower.
[144:30.78]I love this thing so much.
[144:32.42]I gotta be so sad when it's empty.
[144:41.27]Oh, you... This is where I fought the fucking guy before.
[144:45.57]Dissection room.
[144:46.25]We're gonna go up into the right.
[144:47.63]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[144:48.61]I'm so sorry.
[144:51.01]I just... I lose myself.
[144:52.39]I don't know where I am, you know?
[144:53.53]It's hard to tell where the fuck I'm even sitting.
[144:56.97]There we go.
[145:03.04]Up and to the right.
[145:04.06]Let's hope we don't run into any more booger people.
[145:09.52]Here it is.
[145:17.21]Rigor mortis must have said in his joints are already stiff.
[145:21.37]There's a sickening sweet stench.
[145:24.19]He's starting to rot.
[145:27.84]Prove you're a real man.
[145:29.14]Stick your hand down this pig's throat.
[145:31.24]Snake key.
[145:53.79]That pretty little thing will help you find the two key cards you're going to need to join the party we're having over here.
[146:02.33]You've got to earn your way, Ethan.
[146:04.25]Oh, God.
[146:07.83]Well, I mean, there's a snake key right there.
[146:11.69]Let's just get out of here.
[146:14.27]Chemical, right?
[146:15.27]Chem.
[146:15.51]I got a heal.
[146:20.95]Take the chem fluid and do it again.
[146:22.09]I can make another one.
[146:27.12]Full health.
[146:31.36]Hey, hey!
[146:32.22]There's two of them!
[146:33.24]There's two!
[146:34.60]Two!
[146:54.94]Die already!
[146:55.84]Die!
[146:59.48]Right in the head.
[147:00.48]Right in the head.
[147:01.90]I missed.
[147:11.35]Jumping Jehoshaphat.
[147:17.86]I'm running low on ammo.
[147:18.60]There's a snake door right up here.
[147:37.57]Guys, ayayay!
[147:40.31]Ayayay.
[147:42.75]That's all I can say is ayayay.
[147:45.36]I don't have any other words.
[147:46.64]Jeez, man.
[147:49.58]Give me a break.
[147:51.60]When do I get a break?
[147:56.02]Anything down here I can grab?
[147:59.72]Gunpowder.
[148:00.38]Old meat.
[148:05.22]There's a snake door.
[148:06.04]What's a snake key?
[148:10.42]Crow key?
[148:11.77]Snake key.
[148:30.88]It's gonna be another one of those silly monsters right here.
[148:33.52]I can feel it.
[148:34.50]I can feel it in my bones.
[148:44.35]Hey, okay.
[148:47.51]Where's the snake door?
[148:51.43]Not there, not there.
[148:57.50]Snake door.
[149:03.38]Let's see, snake door, I need a snake door.
[149:13.26]Hello?
[149:19.13]Oh, a Prada bag.
[149:22.11]I love Prada.
[149:24.59]No more jokes.
[149:26.41]Just get the fuck out of here and open up another snake door.
[149:32.97]I need to save.
[149:33.69]I need a save point.
[149:37.17]Papa.
[149:38.75]Where's my papa?
[149:41.03]Papa?
[149:42.97]Papa?
[149:45.12]Papa?
[149:45.62]Papa?
[149:56.84]Papa?
[150:03.52]I don't have any ammo.
[150:05.74]I'm so out of fucking ammo.
[150:07.50]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[150:22.96]Travis was in here.
[150:24.02]That's right.
[150:25.04]Okay.
[150:27.08]I gotta find a new snake door.
[150:30.74]Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[150:38.66]Give me a second.
[150:43.12]Where's the new snake door?
[150:44.58]That's the thing I need to know.
[150:49.09]Panicking?
[150:50.67]Not quite, not yet.
[150:58.67]Use the air blast?
[151:03.81]Well, let's get back out to the trailer.
[151:07.49]Find a new snake door.
[151:08.85]See what happens.
[151:11.47]Gotta go to the second floor.
[151:19.32]Damn, this thing is kind of uncomfortable.
[151:24.16]Kind of uncomfortable, but you know sometimes you gotta deal with it, alright?
[151:30.95]This is for science.
[151:31.85]This is for... Okay, second floor.
[151:35.19]Snake door.
[151:35.81]There it is.
[151:37.79]Grandma's room.
[151:38.43]We're gonna go back to that original room.
[151:40.11]There's two snake doors here.
[151:41.17]This is the main house.
[151:43.72]Where the fuck am I right now?
[151:44.84]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[151:49.60]Get me the fuck on out of here.
[151:50.90]You know what I'm saying?
[151:53.58]No ammo.
[151:55.56]Alright, this way.
[151:59.26]This way, boys and girls.
[152:00.21]We'll find our way out.
[152:05.37]There we are.
[152:08.61]Maybe Grandma will show up.
[152:10.53]And we can put a bullet in her brain.
[152:12.45]Okay, second floor.
[152:16.61]Let's see if we can go out here.
[152:22.42]This game is not a game to play while you drink.
[152:24.14]I... I...
[152:29.41]What are you doing over here, man?
[152:32.01]Fuck it.
[152:32.41]I don't even want to fight you.
[152:38.90]Follow me all you want, dude.
[152:40.92]I'm not fighting you.
[152:43.34]Where's the snake door?
[152:44.86]Snake door.
[152:45.36]There's a snake door here.
[152:50.52]Right here.
[152:53.31]Snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake.
[152:59.32]Phew!
[152:59.64]Oh, this room is nice!
[153:03.36]What a nice room!
[153:05.40]I wonder if there's a little boy here.
[153:07.02]Let's play the piano.
[153:08.44]It's broken.
[153:09.42]How is it... What?
[153:12.42]Herb?
[153:14.40]Yeah.
[153:15.42]My health is okay.
[153:20.98]Pretty nice silverware.
[153:23.24]This is crooked.
[153:23.98]Fucking PlayStation Virtual Reality?
[153:28.14]What's this?
[153:31.06]Oh, hold on.
[153:33.87]Oliver stopped his yelling, but sometimes I hear knocking from above.
[153:37.91]It really stinks.
[153:39.83]And some weird juice is dripping from the ceiling.
[153:43.14]Anyway, since I had time, I changed the remote control trophy again.
[153:46.90]Now it'll be shiny even at night.
[153:51.47]Whatever you say, kid.
[153:55.83]Is there anything I can take?
[153:58.55]Rub your room, of all places, I guess.
[154:04.84]Fuck.
[154:09.74]Fucking hell.
[154:13.75]Fuck.
[154:18.25]I gotta do it.
[154:19.01]It's so important to have burner fuel right now.
[154:22.11]This gun is so good.
[154:28.67]Third place, second junior engineering contest.
[154:34.33]Okay.
[154:37.95]Third engineering contest.
[154:43.20]Right.
[154:45.34]Honorable mention, Amateur Robotics Championship 1998.
[154:48.10]Okay.
[154:58.09]What the fuck is this?
[155:04.69]Okay.
[155:06.85]Mommy took me to the hospital in town.
[155:08.75]They took a photo of my head with a weird machine.
[155:11.69]Then mommy bought me a 259 piece puzzle from this toy store.
[155:16.49]Stupid Oliver keeps teasing me.
[155:18.04]You're a crazy head.
[155:20.38]Right.
[155:50.41]So where the fuck is it, huh?
[155:53.62]What are you hiding?
[156:02.22]Right?
[156:02.60]I mean, where?
[156:06.35]What the fuck is it?
[156:16.92]Where's this remote control?
[156:19.16]That she apparently has built into one of these things.
[156:23.48]What the fuck is this?
[156:41.94]I don't know.
[156:42.38]I don't know.
[156:51.79]Lockpick.
[157:12.42]Jackpot!
[157:17.66]I'm coming for you, Evelyn.
[157:26.32]Oh, happy birthday, huh?
[157:36.66]I mean, I... Fuck.
[157:45.65]Toy axe, toy gun.
[157:47.35]Like, what the fuck do I do with this stuff?
[157:56.58]Shadow activated doorway in main hall.
[158:02.65]Model shotgun.
[158:03.57]I don't even fucking understand.
[158:07.37]What am I supposed to do with this shit?
[158:11.76]Oh, I can use that and use this.
[158:15.84]Fuck.
[158:18.04]Hold on, maybe I can get rid of this.
[158:26.31]I can't see.
[158:26.97]Oh dear.
[158:31.91]Um, like that.
[158:37.83]Fuck.
[158:38.33]It's so hard to see that.
[158:41.25]Is that a guy slam dunking a basketball?
[158:50.80]Not quite.
[158:57.46]Almost.
[158:58.06]Wait, no.
[158:58.80]Flip it the other way.
[158:59.46]Like that.
[159:03.61]There it is.
[159:09.57]Blue keycard.
[159:12.33]Okay.
[159:15.05]Can't even fucking pick the goddamn thing up.
[159:42.50]It had to be done.
[159:42.98]It had to be done.
[159:44.90]I'm sorry.
[159:50.44]Y'all know that it had to be done.
[159:52.10]Unfortunately.
[159:56.12]But there's one keycard.
[159:57.10]I think we can get out of here now.
[160:02.18]Make sure I don't leave anything.
[160:05.24]Chat.
[160:07.64]Chat.
[160:09.03]What's the deal with this shit, huh?
[160:14.75]Not using storage.
[160:15.55]Great.
[160:17.63]This shit down here.
[160:21.23]What's the deal?
[160:25.21]I do have the backpack.
[160:26.03]I do.
[160:31.61]I missed a backpack.
[160:32.57]Where did I miss a backpack?
[160:37.98]I picked up a backpack already.
[160:41.22]Let's go store things.
[160:42.12]I mean, are these fucking things important?
[160:45.22]Useless?
[160:48.00]I want to make sure those are not... Okay.
[160:53.30]You don't need it.
[160:53.94]Okay.
[160:58.08]It's a puzzle.
[160:59.00]Okay.
[161:02.55]It's for the good ending.
[161:06.65]The whiskey has all the answers.
[161:08.05]Well, we're getting down to the bottom of it.
[161:11.97]Don't fucking do it.
[161:13.23]I'm just placing.
[161:14.19]Look.
[161:15.57]I'm going like this.
[161:17.65]This shit is being placed on my fucking lap?
[161:32.57]Let's just go open the other door.
[161:35.17]Chat is not being helpful.
[161:41.23]I'll be fine.
[161:42.43]Let's go back in.
[161:47.21]Oh, a Christmas tree.

[161:55.81]Get the other key card.
[161:56.71]And that's all she wrote.
[162:00.17]I think that's it for here.
[162:03.83]I have no bullets for this gun, but I do have flame.

[198:00.26]I don't see a rope on this door.
[198:11.07]I mean, that's like a light switch.
[198:22.58]I thought that was made out of metal.
[198:24.16]I thought that was made out of fucking... I thought that was like wire cutters were needed.
[198:29.28]Seriously, I thought that was like metal.
[198:31.47]Ah, fun balloon room.
[198:35.83]Give me a break.
[198:43.70]Fucking password?
[198:46.64]What's the password?
[198:49.06]Now we need a password.
[198:49.98]Just pop all the balloons and we'll find the password.
[199:04.75]Happy?
[199:06.17]Happy.
[199:06.53]Alright, it's definitely not happy.
[199:23.57]This balloon's respawning?
[199:25.13]Alright, I know where that goes.
[199:34.44]That goes over here.
[199:43.20]Fill it up!
[199:48.81]What?
[199:50.25]He's got stabbed in the chest with... Ooh.
[199:56.68]Pull it out.
[199:57.94]Pull it out.
[200:01.82]Quill pen.
[200:02.64]Alright, that goes in this idiot's hand.
[200:05.96]And maybe he'll give me the password.
[200:11.90]Come on.
[200:13.28]Let's see it.
[200:17.65]What are you doing?
[200:24.34]What are you doing?
[200:31.68]Loser?
[200:34.66]Loser.
[200:38.26]Password is loser.
[200:43.83]Of course it is.
[200:45.49]Loser.
[200:57.47]Loser.
[201:07.74]Open up.
[201:16.77]It's the valve handle, okay.
[201:19.67]That goes in the other room.
[201:23.23]This is a real pain in the ass, isn't it?
[201:27.46]This is a real pain in the ass.
[201:31.54]This turns the water off.
[201:32.74]There we go.
[201:37.60]And we can get out of this fucking nightmare.
[201:42.11]Light it up.
[201:45.25]See you later.
[201:48.25]Let's go.
[202:02.44]Right?
[202:15.15]Oh, that's bright.
[202:16.35]That's bright.
[202:17.97]I can't stop that.
[202:19.29]I can't cover my eyes.
[202:20.21]I can close my eyes.
[202:23.42]What the fuck?
[202:24.66]Turn the valve back on.
[202:27.73]Turn the valve back on.
[202:28.55]Go.
[202:28.97]Oh, my God.
[202:30.47]What the fuck?
[202:34.57]What the fuck?
[202:58.30]What the fuck was the point of that whole thing?
[203:08.40]I didn't gain anything from that.
[203:10.95]I didn't get an item.
[203:11.77]I didn't progress the story.
[203:12.97]I just... I just did that.
[203:17.77]Congratulations.
[203:21.39]Pretty sure I just wasted like 28 minutes of time.
[203:28.03]Unless that means something I don't know.
[203:29.87]I don't know.
[203:31.63]I feel like that was a waste of time.
[203:35.79]Shit wasn't even scary.
[203:38.91]Go to the funny looking Diablo clown and give him a pen.
[203:42.70]Oh, he wrote down loser.
[203:44.60]You're a loser.
[203:47.90]Please watch this fucking 10 minute loading screen while we load the real game.
[203:57.08]Anything else I can complain about?
[203:58.28]Anything else?
[203:58.62]What do you guys think?
[204:01.67]What do you think?
[204:16.72]Yeah.
[204:16.84]Okay.
[204:24.26]Okay.
[204:29.23]Hey, look at that.
[204:29.95]We can play the video game again.
[204:31.71]Alright, let's save it.
[204:40.33]Save this shit.
[204:40.93]We'll open up the door.
[204:41.71]And then I'm probably going to call it.
[204:45.04]Because after like... After like three and a half hours of being in VR, I kind of have to take a break.
[204:56.84]Console loading times?
[204:59.69]You're mad that you get called a loser by somebody else but us.
[205:03.93]That's not true.
[205:06.83]Alright.
[205:07.91]Let's go open those doors.
[205:09.98]I mean, the game is saved, so whatever is there is there.
[205:14.40]Whatever is on the other side, I'm going to call it for tonight.
[205:17.10]We'll be back tomorrow with the potential... God damn it!
[205:35.65]Just open the fucking door.
[205:36.95]Fucking hell.
[205:51.01]Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching the stream.
[205:56.95]That's going to be it.
[205:57.81]Thank you for watching.
[205:59.25]Hope you enjoyed the Resident Evil 7 stream.
[206:03.32]That was fun.
[206:06.16]We'll pick up tomorrow where we left off.
[206:09.78]We'll get in that door tomorrow.
[206:17.37]The game doesn't want me to leave.
[206:20.01]Apparently not.
[206:20.83]Yeah, that's going to be it.
[206:22.67]I need to take a break.
[206:25.75]Three and a half hours is like my like before I get a headache.
[206:31.42]I think we'll probably finish the game tomorrow.
[206:34.26]I would assume, right?
[206:35.84]I think the game's about 10 hours long.
[206:38.34]Unless I've been taking it really slowly, which I probably have been.
[206:42.30]But, thank you for watching, everybody.
[206:44.49]We're back tomorrow night.
[206:47.61]100 bucks goes to the Jimmy Fun, that's true.
[206:53.75]Yeah, I need to take a little bit of a break.
[206:57.17]Rest my eyes a little.
[206:59.09]Starting to get that feeling, you know.
[207:04.17]Don't forget to donate.
[207:04.82]I will not forget.
[207:05.58]Don't worry.
[207:08.58]By the way, that puzzle does come back.
[207:10.52]That videotape was not a waste.
[207:11.78]Okay, well, that's good to know.
[207:14.23]But thanks, everybody.
[207:15.35]That's going to be it.
[207:18.85]Sorry, again, I couldn't see any bits or subs because notifications have been turned off.
[207:23.41]Because there is absolutely no way for me to see them when I'm inside that helmet.
[207:28.59]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[207:29.53]We'll be back tomorrow night, same time.
[207:31.91]Hopefully we can get close to the end of the game.
[207:34.29]If we do not end the game tomorrow, then we will pick it up the next week.
[207:41.31]I might try to finish it on the weekend.
[207:43.24]We'll see.
