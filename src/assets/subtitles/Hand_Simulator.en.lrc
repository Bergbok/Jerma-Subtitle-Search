[00:05.15]Alright.
[00:05.57]Hi.
[00:06.17]Hello, everybody.
[00:10.75]How's it going?
[00:11.77]How's your day?
[00:17.14]A lot of stuff going on.
[00:21.96]About 15 minutes before, 20 minutes before about to start the stream.
[00:26.60]I had to make sure that Kim got to the doctor because she's not feeling well.
[00:31.16]That was just popped up.
[00:36.13]I'm just coming off a few days of being disoriented from having a procedure done to me.
[00:41.79]And then we had to move Halo to tomorrow.
[00:49.72]And then I had to talk to a bunch of people.
[00:51.70]Today's been a busy, busy, busy day.
[01:03.54]I almost read that out loud.
[01:05.34]It was really close for me to read that out loud.
[01:08.68]Yeah, she's okay.
[01:12.68]How do I feel?
[01:13.46]Well, I have gotten a few answers.
[01:20.41]And I'm not sure what that means for these answers, but it means I have to keep going.
[01:25.27]I have to keep figuring stuff out.
[01:34.08]But some of the things I thought were real are real.
[01:41.32]I don't know.
[01:43.12]It's kind of a weird scenario.
[01:47.99]I have a hernia.
[01:48.85]Let's just put it that way.
[01:49.77]I have a hiatal hernia.
[01:52.11]And... Uh... I might also have... Uh... Costochondritis.
[01:59.52]Which is inflammation in your ribs.
[02:02.14]Like my rib cage is like fucked up or something.
[02:06.07]So... Uh... I've... It's been a weird... It's been an interesting couple days.
[02:13.09]Let's put it that way.
[02:17.23]Am I alright?
[02:17.81]Yeah, I'm fine.
[02:18.55]I'm doing alright.
[02:19.11]I'm fine.
[02:20.37]I got a hernia from laughing too hard.
[02:21.93]I don't think so.
[02:25.82]That's not... I don't think that's how you get a hiatal hernia.
[02:31.84]But... He's gonna... The harder I laugh, the more I get... I'm in pain.
[02:42.26]The hernia is just a hairball in his stomach.
[02:49.74]But... I still don't know exactly what's going on.
[02:56.32]So that was literally two and a half, three days ago.
[02:59.37]So, hey, this is what's going on.
[03:00.87]There might be something else going on.
[03:02.43]We're gonna go talk to somebody else now.
[03:07.53]The game board of figuring out medical issues is just... We move like two more spaces.
[03:19.02]To the right.
[03:19.42]You know, we rolled two.
[03:22.50]And now, okay, when can we land on Park Place?
[03:27.12]Can I land on the boardwalk yet?
[03:28.82]Like, when do I pass go?
[03:31.78]No, no, no, you landed on Baltic Avenue.
[03:34.90]That place sucks.
[03:36.98]Yeah, I don't want Baltic Avenue.
[03:38.46]You're going to have to wait until next week.
[03:40.58]You're going to have to wait two weeks to take another turn.
[03:44.36]Oh, okay.
[03:45.34]Okay.
[03:50.11]siri don't I'm not talking to you sir get out of here don't record this siri don't record me anyways uh let's I didn't make a tweet alright I'll be right back be right back
[04:57.67]okay sorry I'm like texting people to this this like it's the busiest day of year apparently but we are today uh today is not even a stream let me just be very very clear about this
[05:14.58]I was going to go three days in a row, starting with Halo.
[05:17.36]But Halo had to get pushed to tomorrow.
[05:20.24]I think Joel was doing something that he wanted to finish.
[05:22.74]So I was like, yeah, that's fine.
[05:24.30]Let's go.
[05:25.66]And then on Friday, we're probably going to do that Tools Up game.
[05:30.04]So we're just doing four days in a row.
[05:31.98]Because I'm back.
[05:33.36]I'm coming back.
[05:35.55]So we're just doing probably three, four straight days in a row as of today and tomorrow.
[05:41.25]What that means...
[05:43.14]is we get to play a game that I've wanted to play and everyone hates for some reason.
[05:52.07]Hey, I hate this game.
[05:53.83]This game sucks.
[05:54.63]This game's stupid.
[05:55.37]Don't play that game.
[05:56.45]Well, I already bought it.
[06:04.44]So, I'm just gonna... We're just gonna hang out for a little while.
[06:08.46]And this is a stream that's not even a real stream.
[06:13.34]The real stream starts tomorrow.
[06:15.52]This is the pre-stream comeback stream.
[06:19.64]We're gonna be playing, of course, I'm talking about Hand Simulator.
[06:27.82]This one's not canon.
[06:32.97]I saw one person say yes.
[06:39.20]This is the Halo Reach Tomorrow waiting room.
[06:42.72]Yes, I'm aware.
[06:46.08]Alright.
[06:47.16]So how hand simulator works, for those of you that don't know.
[06:52.66]You just use your hands.
[06:56.92]You get to play with fidget spinners.
[06:58.50]Remember when that was cool?
[07:01.48]The Milkmaid, Merry Christmas and Horror.
[07:07.32]Are we gaming?
[07:08.44]No.
[07:09.78]Well, let's do the fidget spinners.
[07:10.84]Let's get it out of the way.
[07:12.28]This might be really loud, too.
[07:13.68]I have no idea.
[07:15.98]Is it gonna be loud?
[07:20.78]Uh, it's not loud at all.
[07:21.58]There's no audio.
[07:23.26]Help.
[07:24.94]A-S-D-F space.
[07:26.62]Bend certain fingers.
[07:31.98]How do I do, uh... A-S-D-F.
[07:36.55]Oh, F is... Okay.
[07:39.45]So is this Surgeon Simulator, but you just do regular, like, normal stuff?
[07:46.05]Why is this... So, is there any audio?
[07:47.89]Okay, bend all fingers.
[07:51.57]Hands mode.
[07:52.43]Oh, you switch hands.
[07:53.93]Space is run.
[07:56.83]Crouch?
[07:57.35]Why would there be a crouch?
[08:00.51]Okay, right mouse button is rotate.
[08:03.99]This is just Surgeon Simulator with two hands.
[08:08.54]He's gonna get bored.
[08:09.79]Alright, so... How do I go down?
[08:24.19]Rotate forearm.
[08:25.55]But how do I move my hand just down?
[08:27.64]How do I move it down?
[08:29.68]Middle mouse button?
[08:30.50]No.
[08:33.00]Why am I locked in place?
[08:36.60]What's wrong with me?
[08:44.18]Left shift is handsmoke.
[08:45.35]Okay, oh, there we go.
[08:46.03]Alright.
[08:47.85]So, what do I need to do?
[08:48.97]I need to pick up the fidget spinner and spin it.
[08:54.19]Oh, it's the mouse wheel.
[08:55.53]Alright.
[09:02.02]Shit, this was, like, funny fucking seven years ago.
[09:04.76]God damn it!
[09:05.54]I know!
[09:08.00]I understand.
[09:08.44]I know this was funny back in, like, 2013. 2013.
[09:12.96]But just imagine we're there again.
[09:16.31]How do I pick this up?
[09:21.13]What do you mean, no, it wasn't?
[09:23.43]If this was not funny in 2013, why did every single person make a YouTube channel about this exact video game?
[09:36.56]It was bait.
[09:37.46]Somebody thought it was funny.
[09:43.59]Alright, pull it up.
[09:46.17]I did.
[09:47.95]Wait, I almost got it.

[10:01.46]Did I win?
[10:05.64]What do I do with it now?
[10:08.48]I have to make it spin.
[10:11.16]How do I lock this into place?

[10:45.42]This is wacky.
[10:46.32]You guys wanted wacky!
[10:47.80]Here it is!
[10:48.34]It's not quite wacky.
[10:55.21]This would be music too.
[10:56.43]Why is it no audio in this whole game?
[10:58.39]It's not tearing fingers off.
[11:12.01]Shit, this is just, this is like wacky, in quotes.
[11:15.58]Now I know what you guys are talking about.
[11:17.58]Hold on.
[11:23.34]Hold on.
[11:23.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:24.52]I at least have to get one of these done.
[11:26.68]I bought the fucking game.
[11:31.53]Play the multiplayer?
[11:32.39]Well, I can't go into multiplayer until I know how this game works.
[11:35.15]Alright, put the whole thing down.
[11:43.22]This game's $2?
[11:43.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:48.14]I'll get it.
[11:51.50]Is it $2?
[11:55.15]Dab with the fidget spinner.
[12:05.09]I need to... How do you... Okay, I need... To be able to do this, I need to do this in real life first.
[12:10.53]How do you pick shit up?
[12:11.95]I don't even know how to be a person you do this.
[12:16.45]Like, you grab, like, I just grab stuff.
[12:18.82]I don't, like, know how.
[12:19.98]I just do it.
[12:20.52]It's like breathing.
[12:22.62]So, I need to, like, pick this up in real life before I can actually know how to do this.
[12:27.92]You go down and use your thumb, right?
[12:30.71]What's the thumb?
[12:33.15]Thumb is space.
[12:34.71]So if it were me in real life, I would go like this.
[12:38.99]And I would do my thumb and my index finger.
[12:47.45]Right?
[12:47.81]Yeah?
[12:48.23]Okay.
[12:49.39]This is how you pick stuff up, right?
[12:50.87]There we go.
[12:53.50]Hold on.
[12:53.78]I almost got it.
[13:00.16]Get it!
[13:01.00]Come on.
[13:01.58]Pick it up.
[13:09.28]That one's too hard to get.
[13:10.22]I'm going to get this one.
[13:12.54]So what's the point of the other hand?
[13:15.00]Alright, go like this.
[13:21.59]Come on.
[13:26.15]Okay, I got it.
[13:29.67]Now how do I get it to spin?
[13:33.51]What if it's like a soundtrack?
[13:34.75]Alright, hold on.
[13:35.33]Let me get it to spin.
[13:44.94]I can't breathe!
[13:47.08]I can't breathe!
[13:48.64]It's so funny!
[13:50.98]Oh, I fucking dropped it.
[13:53.06]Oops.
[13:57.90]Fuck.
[14:00.92]I actually didn't mean to do that.
[14:01.88]Wait, this one's bigger.
[14:03.88]Maybe I can pick up a picture and do some funny drawing.
[14:08.49]Actually, wait.
[14:08.83]I probably can do that.
[14:09.87]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:10.77]I'm interested now.
[14:12.83]I wasn't interested until 10 seconds ago.
[14:17.17]Give me the pencil.
[14:19.23]How do you pick up a pencil?
[14:25.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[14:25.94]Don't drop it.
[14:26.32]I'm right-handed.
[14:27.08]I should be using this.
[14:30.44]You see?
[14:31.14]He's a fucking wacky Twitch personality.
[14:37.21]It's too hard to grab stuff!
[14:40.91]Okay, I got this.
[14:41.99]Now I have to... Actually, I have to activate it, right?
[14:46.71]So let's activate it.
[14:50.89]What's the hand again?
[14:51.81]It's this one?
[14:52.21]Alright.
[14:55.64]Flick it down, right?
[15:00.20]Why is this not working?
[15:01.10]Flick it down!
[15:10.67]What the fuck am I doing?
[15:13.45]This looks like it hurts.
[15:17.09]Is it already activated?
[15:18.47]No, there's no pen coming down.
[15:33.19]What about the thumb?
[15:34.13]Let's try the thumb.
[15:35.69]Space, right?
[15:38.74]bring it up bring it back like this grip it and then is this pen already activated oh I mean oh something about me something about me
[16:07.53]I can't... No, I have to put it up in my face.
[16:09.53]I actually kind of like this.
[16:17.53]So, I don't... Middle mouse button is look mode.
[16:25.14]Wait, hold on.
[16:26.86]Can I freeze individual hands?
[16:30.24]Alright, click it down.
[16:33.21]Why isn't it clicking it down?
[16:38.45]Am I stupid?
[16:39.23]Am I actually out of my mind?
[16:40.37]Or am I not doing this right?
[16:49.31]Both.
[16:55.36]Don't fuck come at me.
[16:56.74]Don't.
[17:02.74]I don't understand how this works.
[17:04.90]First of all, this needs to go down.
[17:07.64]Act like a normal human.
[17:09.06]And just put your hand down.
[17:11.68]And then this is how I would let you write on a desk.
[17:13.72]Okay, now put this down here.
[17:20.11]Standard document.
[17:24.91]How do I write?
[17:26.67]Wait, hold on.
[17:27.89]Let it go for a second.
[17:31.85]Middle mouse is look.
[17:34.23]Alright, so shift hands.
[17:36.51]So that's it, that is how you freeze.
[17:46.32]Okay, so if you want to freeze something you have to hit shift.
[17:53.12]So right now... I need to, I gotta pick this back up, just drop it.
[18:02.65]Holding it like a syringe.
[18:04.84]Yeah, well, how the fuck am I supposed to do it?
[18:14.29]Is this even possible?
[18:18.09]Tell me now if this... Stop, I don't want to waste my time anymore.
[18:21.33]Is this possible to pick up the pen and use it?
[18:28.58]Yes.
[18:33.58]Are you sure?
[18:44.36]Grab it!
[18:45.90]Grab it!
[18:47.76]Okay, I got it.
[18:53.89]Now, I have to arc my hand up.
[19:02.67]Like this.
[19:06.27]Alright.
[19:07.87]Get it down there.
[19:11.39]Now how do, do I, okay, do I have to click this?
[19:22.77]I actually have to click this down.
[19:31.32]You have to write funny.
[19:37.30]Yeah, but for me to write funny, I need the pen to work, and all these pens, you have to push these buttons down.
[19:47.89]This pressure there, why is it not working?
[19:55.54]This should be working.
[19:58.25]Is it ready to go?
[19:59.15]He doesn't know how to use a pen.
[20:04.23]This is how you use a pen.
[20:05.45]I know how to use a pen, look!
[20:10.81]Like, this pen sucks, okay?
[20:12.48]It needs, wait, stay right there.
[20:28.53]Fuck.
[20:29.27]I almost got it.
[20:33.73]Come on.
[20:40.57]Ah!
[20:41.65]Just click for fuck's sake.
[20:46.90]Oh!
[20:47.68]No!
[20:51.78]Please!
[20:52.50]I don't wanna... Just...
[20:57.76]Wait, I gotta bring this over here.
[21:00.66]Closer like up in my fucking face.
[21:02.13]And put it up so it's like that.
[21:05.11]And then up into my face.
[21:07.01]Right there.
[21:07.69]Here we go.
[21:13.51]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[21:16.89]What's wrong with this pen?
[21:28.77]What is wrong?
[21:29.43]What's wrong with the pen?
[21:31.17]Use your palm instead.
[21:41.58]That's not gonna work.
[21:45.77]Why am I handing the air?
[21:50.91]What am I doing?
[21:57.90]This is gonna drive me fucking crazy.
[22:00.12]You know what?
[22:00.66]Move this hand over here.
[22:02.12]Your hands just move on their own, just slowly.
[22:04.56]See how it's like moving to the right?
[22:07.22]Come here.
[22:08.65]No, you fucking dumb thing.
[22:14.27]Move it over here and up.
[22:16.31]Right there.
[22:17.63]Okay.
[22:18.89]Now I have my index finger.
[22:20.05]I'm gonna tilt like this.
[22:23.46]Like that.
[22:31.79]Why is this so hard?
[22:35.83]Why is this so hard to do?
[22:46.94]This fucking camera.
[22:53.78]And then down.
[22:55.43]And then we do an index finger right here.
[23:15.79]I'm gonna do it in a different strategy.
[23:16.88]I'm coming through here.
[23:21.58]This is not how hands work.
[23:23.78]No, it's not.
[23:25.54]It's a mess.
[23:31.30]I'm currently on it.
[23:35.74]How much pressure needs to go on this thing for it to be closed?
[23:37.94]Why is this thing made out of fucking cement?
[23:41.95]Why can't I just push it down?
[23:49.03]It doesn't make any sense.
[23:55.69]Alright.
[23:58.01]Already angry?
[23:58.95]Yeah, because like what the fuck?
[24:02.93]It doesn't make any sense.
[24:11.90]And plus, alright, when I move my hand to the right, it just immediately moves it.
[24:16.96]Look at this.
[24:18.42]Where are you going?
[24:22.31]Where is his hand going?
[24:23.75]Do I have my controller plugged in moving up?
[24:33.61]Move to the right.
[24:34.77]Are you sure you didn't move up to the left?
[24:38.08]This is a chill stream.
[24:39.00]It is.
[24:46.00]Tilt it this way.
[24:48.60]Like this.
[24:52.58]Stay right there.
[25:09.32]Come on, wait!
[25:17.40]Somebody help me here and tell me why I can't move these things.
[25:28.19]Alright.
[25:29.41]You gotta tell me why the fuck that ain't moving.
[25:34.53]It doesn't click.
[25:35.31]What do you mean it doesn't click?
[25:56.16]Sometimes it just doesn't work.
[26:02.09]Give me the pen.
[26:02.83]No, give me the fidget spinner.
[26:03.89]Give me the beer.
[26:04.55]Give me the, I don't know.
[26:05.17]Give me something else.
[26:05.97]Fuck.
[26:17.41]Why can't I lean this way?
[26:19.33]Bring the other hand over here.
[26:22.32]Oh, it's gone.
[26:24.29]I can't even reach that far!
[26:25.93]How am I supposed to get this?
[26:29.11]My body actually can't go that far.
[26:31.55]How are you supposed to reach this stuff on this table?
[26:41.18]Is there, like, a lean button?
[26:46.56]C?
[26:46.86]C doesn't do anything.
[26:50.99]Can I, like, move my body?
[26:56.79]Can't even... Nope.
[27:04.39]Oh my god.
[27:10.06]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[27:11.40]I got it, I almost got it.
[27:12.14]Alright, the mouse scroll into clicking and holding.
[27:24.88]Like, that ain't gonna work.
[27:37.44]Let me try... I have to do at least one of these fucking tasks.
[27:43.58]I don't care how stupid and shitty this is.
[27:45.44]I almost got it.
[27:50.86]Come on.
[27:57.18]If it spins in the air once, it counts.
[27:58.88]I don't care.
[28:00.92]Now wait, hold on.
[28:02.16]I think I can grab it with the other hand.
[28:09.74]Oh no, he doesn't like hand game.
[28:16.92]Is that really a big deal if I don't like hand simulator?
[28:20.32]That can't be a big deal.
[28:32.40]It's not a big deal if I don't like hand simulator.
[28:41.53]Just grab it!
[28:46.96]Get it!
[28:50.28]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[28:52.40]No, didn't work.
[29:04.23]Can you even fucking do anything?
[29:14.54]Are you having fun?
[29:17.34]No.
[29:21.72]Ow.
[29:23.16]Stop.
[29:23.52]Hey, you know I got a hernia.
[29:24.60]You can't make me laugh.
[29:25.50]I have a hernia now.
[29:28.26]If I could pick this up.
[29:37.49]Make him laugh.
[29:38.27]Make him laugh.
[29:40.29]Alright.
[29:41.57]I almost feel like I want a different control scheme for this.
[29:46.55]Mouse X, Y, and scroll wheel is move forearm.
[29:56.16]Using the scroll, I wish I could make that right click and move down.
[30:01.46]In VR, it's a one-to-one movement.
[30:03.26]I feel like if you did this in VR, everything would just be really easy.
[30:06.21]You just pick it up with your hands.
[30:10.49]You just pick it up.
[30:25.14]Got it.
[30:25.36]I don't even know what buttons I'm holding.
[30:30.16]I don't know what buttons I'm holding.
[30:40.53]Spin it.
[30:46.33]Quiet.
[30:51.87]That counts.
[30:52.21]That counts.
[30:55.01]It counts.
[30:55.89]I got it.
[30:56.17]It counts.
[31:02.25]It counts.
[31:03.68]See?
[31:05.66]This would be real sad if you saw somebody doing this.
[31:10.88]ResidentSleeper.
[31:12.45]Pog.
[31:23.60]Alright, I beat this one.
[31:24.42]Let's do another one.
[31:25.70]That took 30 minutes.
[31:31.99]Holy shit.
[31:32.93]Time flies when you fucking hate the game you're playing.
[31:38.57]Alright, how about, uh... Let me see if I can fix this, though.
[31:43.54]No, I did it.
[31:44.20]Alright, what's the other ones?
[31:48.24]Milkmaid.
[31:53.50]Alright, now we have all of a sudden audio.
[31:54.85]What is this, a cow?
[32:20.22]It's a cow.
[32:20.90]It's a cow.
[32:22.90]Alright.
[32:23.40]Do I do the other hand?
[32:24.16]So this one was... This is it.
[32:48.15]Punch the cow.
[32:49.34]Ban that person.
[32:50.34]Get that person out of here.
[32:57.30]I just had it too.
[33:02.08]I already did it.
[33:03.00]I did it.
[33:03.40]I can do the next one.
[33:11.17]It slipped.
[33:15.95]Alright, I win.
[33:26.31]I'm watching this in between classes.
[33:27.89]I'm milking a cow!
[33:30.71]This is a fucking cow!
[33:34.26]Alright, I got enough milk.
[33:35.08]I got enough.
[33:35.90]I got enough.
[33:37.12]Uh... What is horror?
[33:40.02]What the fuck is this?
[33:53.79]Okay, there's WASD in this one.
[33:59.60]How do I control my hands?
[34:00.50]Am I gonna die?
[34:11.57]Okay.
[34:13.19]That was... They were just there, in the room.
[34:21.73]Are they slowly walking?
[34:23.14]Do I have to kill this person?
[34:29.18]Alright, we're gonna use the candle.
[34:38.07]No, we're not.
[34:38.93]We're gonna use, um... There goes all my light.
[34:42.86]Why does your hand float back up?
[34:45.20]I don't understand.
[34:47.84]When you put your hand down, it just comes back up.
[34:50.53]Down.
[34:51.01]Up.
[34:51.37]Down.
[34:51.75]Up.
[34:52.55]Stay down!
[35:00.56]That's how hands work?
[35:01.68]No, if I put my hand down, it's not going to float up.
[35:06.60]I'm not on a bunch of drugs.
[35:09.14]Hurry up.
[35:09.64]I'm trying.
[35:27.11]Punch her.
[35:29.65]I don't think you can punch.
[35:30.43]Alright, I'll try punching her.
[35:46.05]Come on, Moe!
[35:46.59]What are you, crazy?
[35:47.15]Oh, jeez!
[36:09.62]This looks like I'm just arguing.
[36:11.32]Why is she not walking any closer?
[36:19.40]I'm just like, pointing.
[36:33.79]Is it working?
[36:45.12]I think I'm pushing her.
[36:55.03]Is this working?
[36:56.21]Hold on.
[36:58.01]Well, that one sucks.
[37:07.67]How about shooting range?
[37:13.76]Choose a weapon.
[37:15.02]Alright, how about zero?
[37:19.96]This is going to be impossible.
[37:22.96]This will be actually impossible.
[37:30.04]Maybe not.
[37:30.32]Alright, stay there.
[37:42.20]Alright, keep it right there, right?
[37:49.90]Which way does it go in?
[37:58.11]Like this?
[37:59.01]Yeah.
[37:59.97]Don't drop it, don't drop it, don't drop it, don't drop it.
[38:01.91]Come back up.
[38:06.19]No, other way.
[38:12.73]Oh man, this is not gonna work.
[38:15.77]It has to be probably exact too.
[38:23.90]No, pick it back up.
[38:24.74]It's not gonna work.
[38:25.42]Pick it back up.
[38:27.46]Alright.
[38:28.32]I have to come at this from a completely different angle.
[38:37.83]Fucking mouse scroll!
[38:41.26]It hurts my finger to do this this much.
[38:57.66]Get it over here.
[38:58.66]What the fuck?
[39:03.06]Imagine having mouse scroll be anything other than slide around a menu in any video game ever made.
[39:13.91]What just happened?
[39:24.57]I caught it.
[39:25.91]How did I catch that?
[39:26.65]Alright, I gotta slow down.
[39:33.58]Alright, that's not, that's not bad.
[39:35.84]That's not bad.
[39:36.40]Freeze it there.
[39:38.50]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:40.22]Oh, my fucking goddammit.
[39:41.48]Give me a break.
[39:46.28]Do gun second, not first.
[39:54.30]Come on, please.
[39:56.82]Is there a way to rotate my wrist?
[39:59.40]Like that, yeah.
[40:01.22]Do it again.
[40:09.85]What the fu- God fucking damn it, man.
[40:20.62]Why does this have to keep happening?
[40:28.55]Oh, it's killing me.
[40:31.75]You know when you're in a really bad fucking dream and you just want to wake up, but you can't?
[40:38.47]You have to fucking pick up the clip.
[40:43.91]This is not even hand simulator.
[40:45.91]This is bad dream.
[40:47.91]The game.
[40:50.37]I feel like I'm moving the same way that I move when I'm gonna drink.
[40:56.96]Got it.
[41:00.36]Now, turn this way.
[41:04.40]Please, what are you doing?
[41:06.26]Alright, now give me the gun.
[41:07.78]I'm not even, I'm right-handed though, wait.
[41:11.06]Come up this way.
[41:14.75]Like that.
[41:17.13]Alright, almost there.
[41:20.65]Almost there.
[41:23.61]Don't fucking move.
[41:28.86]Eat the bullets.
[41:37.92]Oh my fucking god, why?
[41:42.27]This is... You guys remember QWOP?
[41:47.51]Okay, imagine if QWOP had 15 more buttons.
[41:53.57]Now it's upside down.
[42:06.18]Just re-fucking-fresh it again.
[42:12.23]Stop.
[42:13.69]Just get it!
[42:19.27]Just play co-op instead.
[42:20.75]I know.
[42:21.27]I know.
[42:22.03]I feel the same way as you.
[42:23.57]Alright?
[42:24.29]Can we just be very clear?
[42:25.91]I feel the exact same way, but I can't.
[42:29.25]I have to do this.
[42:34.30]I feel identical to your feelings.
[42:36.94]We are the same right now.
[42:39.44]But I have to do something.
[42:41.74]I have to do this.
[42:43.66]I have to get the guy in the dream.
[42:49.32]Okay.
[42:50.80]Don't move that hand.
[42:56.56]Just play QWOP.
[42:58.34]No.
[42:58.90]I'm not going to play QWOP.
[43:02.00]QWOP.
[43:02.40]You guys want to talk about old YouTube shit?
[43:07.49]QWOP is the boomer of these LOL it's hard to control games.
[43:13.55]And you guys hate boomers.
[43:15.27]Don't.
[43:15.75]I'm getting angry.
[43:16.29]Don't.
[43:24.99]It's gonna fall off the fucking table.
[43:30.67]No, it's not.
[43:31.05]I got it.
[43:33.39]Co-op is a zoomer.
[43:35.58]No, it's not.
[43:36.18]It is the boomer of these types of games.
[43:40.36]Okay.
[43:45.38]Don't let go.
[43:45.88]Don't let go.
[43:46.30]Don't let go.
[43:46.68]Don't let go.
[43:47.13]Don't let go.
[43:47.61]Don't let go.
[43:47.97]What do I do?
[43:49.31]Don't let go.
[43:53.14]I have to hit the mouse scroll, but I can't.
[43:55.40]I can't reach it.
[44:10.15]No, I have to grab this at a better angle.
[44:15.48]Fuck, no.
[44:16.60]No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.
[44:18.64]This is going to be such a miserable experience.
[44:23.67]Alright.
[44:24.39]Stop.
[44:29.05]Why does it have to do that?
[44:31.44]Why does it do that?
[44:32.92]Why does it do that?
[44:37.92]You have to hold the thing and then when you switch you're holding the wrong stuff.
[44:43.98]Make sure you spam mouse scroll down to be able to even have your hand- Remember, when you put your hand down, you- I'm made out of fucking air.
[45:00.90]God, why would you ever make it that button for any reason?
[45:04.52]Literally, make it controlled with my tongue.
[45:06.58]It'd be easier to do.
[45:23.21]Alright.
[45:26.95]See, right now I have to hold all the things that I was currently holding before.
[45:29.61]Alright, let's try it.
[45:57.09]It's weight.
[45:57.74]The weight is going down.
[45:59.22]Oh, this sucks.
[46:04.36]This sucks.
[46:15.09]Get in there, please.
[46:17.01]I have to beat my nightmare.
[46:25.26]Oh!
[46:27.55]Oh, my whole body is fucking hurting right now.
[46:32.42]I hate it, but I can't.
[46:33.90]I have to do it.
[46:35.10]I hate this.
[46:39.98]You know when you sit down to write a paper for college?
[46:43.30]Or for high school, doesn't matter.
[46:44.96]And you hate... You write one sentence and you just go like, I fucking hate this!
[46:52.07]And you stand up and move around and you're like, God damn it, I fucking hate this!
[46:56.63]Then you know you have to do it.
[47:00.58]I feel the same exact way.
[47:01.60]I have to do this.
[47:11.32]Alright, I might be able to... What if I keep this right here?
[47:20.20]Tilt.
[47:21.30]Wrist down.
[47:22.52]It's almost there.
[47:23.06]It's almost there.
[47:24.12]It's almost there.
[47:26.10]It's almost there.
[47:27.64]Look at this shit.
[47:33.95]Does it actually have to be exact?
[47:36.19]No, it fucking doesn't.
[47:46.07]No, it doesn't.
[47:47.91]Why does it need to be exact?
[47:52.11]This is a video game.
[47:53.43]Nothing's exact.
[48:01.07]You have to do it with one eye closed?
[48:03.67]Did somebody even just say that?
[48:04.75]Or am I making that up?
[48:07.29]Alright, it's not in the right place.
[48:11.88]This needs to be up like this.
[48:20.58]Don't.
[48:22.12]Don't.
[48:25.58]Oh.
[48:28.40]If I feel like it's...
[48:49.13]No, no, no, no!
[48:51.43]Jessica.
[49:19.67]Get in there.
[49:21.39]Get the fuck in here.
[49:25.34]Is it in?
[49:26.28]No.
[49:26.80]No, it's not.
[49:29.34]Dude, this is not hard to do this.
[49:35.02]This is not hard to get this in here.
[49:37.35]Don't force it.
[50:00.43]It's not fucking possible.
[50:02.23]It's not possible.
[50:05.23]This is not what you can't... It's not fucking possible.
[50:11.89]Where's my... Where am I going?
[50:12.69]What are you doing?
[50:14.28]What's it doing?
[50:14.78]I'm not touching anything.
[50:17.02]You seeing this shit?
[50:20.22]I'm not touching anything.
[50:28.88]Why is it... What is it doing?
[50:31.30]Alright, I would like to bring my arm down, please.
[50:34.22]Let go.
[50:34.56]You sure you don't want to push it forward?
[50:36.60]That's not what I wanted you to do.
[50:39.76]Why are you, like, phantom moving?
[50:41.71]I don't know.
[50:42.85]What the fuck?
[50:43.31]Alright, I'm going to try something else.
[50:47.67]Put the gun down.
[50:50.73]I want to try to get underneath it.
[50:57.50]Okay, then down.
[51:03.34]This is absolutely not going to work.
[51:06.48]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[51:08.02]There's no way this works.
[51:24.49]Alright.
[51:25.94]I have to at least get it in here.
[51:28.90]Maybe it'll be easier if I go this way.
[51:32.37]Alright, I'm going to try this.
[51:33.25]It just doesn't go the way it doesn't go where you want it to go.
[51:42.28]Stay right here.
[51:44.36]Move forward.
[51:47.86]Don't fucking move.
[51:49.82]You're moving.
[51:51.31]Why are you moving?
[51:51.89]You shouldn't be.
[52:01.36]Which way does it go in?
[52:02.86]Which way does it go in?
[52:07.20]Like this?
[52:09.17]I don't know.
[52:28.00]Would you like to move left?
[52:28.90]No, move right!
[52:32.08]Why is it fighting me to move left?
[52:34.90]Dude, this shit is fighting me.
[52:37.72]Move left.
[52:38.72]No, move this way.
[52:39.76]Move left.
[52:40.28]No, you want to move this way.
[52:41.24]Move left.
[52:41.80]No, move that way.
[52:42.46]What are you doing?
[52:43.14]Why is it a rubber band?
[52:45.18]Why the fuck is it a rubber band?
[52:46.63]I just move here and stop.
[52:51.47]Move mouse left.
[52:52.89]Move mouse right.
[52:53.61]No, what are you doing?
[52:55.29]You don't want to move mouse right?
[52:56.17]No, I want you to stay here.
[53:23.16]It's not.
[53:24.60]It's not gonna work.
[53:28.20]Fucking God.
[53:37.21]Why is my arm just broken?
[53:41.16]Why do you have to hold it like this?
[53:44.30]I have a better idea.
[53:45.36]I have to hold the gun in a different spot.
[53:47.18]I have to hold the gun with two hands.
[53:51.49]Yeah, fuck this.
[53:55.99]Give me this thing.
[53:56.47]Oh my god.
[54:03.96]Fucking mouse scroll.
[54:05.58]Imagine having mouse scroll.
[54:07.22]Imagine it.
[54:08.66]Just imagine mouse scroll.
[54:10.78]I just want you to picture it in your head.
[54:11.80]Alright, move it this way.
[54:22.03]No, I just want to... Imagine.
[54:27.13]Imagine.
[54:29.59]Fucking God.
[54:30.37]I'm in pain in the ass.
[54:40.38]These are great.
[54:46.00]Alright, now wait.
[54:51.35]I just want to tilt it down.
[54:52.79]Why is it so hard to even rotate your wrist?
[54:54.61]It's just all fucked up.
[55:07.51]No, I ain't gonna be able to do that.
[55:16.77]This guy at the gun range, it's like, no, you're doing that real wrong.
[55:24.95]You know what?
[55:25.53]I have a better idea.
[55:26.47]Am I going the right way?
[55:57.73]This is painful to watch, this is painful to play.
[56:01.51]So, I agree with you.
[56:03.85]It sucks.
[56:08.38]But I have to try.
[56:09.46]No, now I have- wait, wait, wait, this is the opportunity.
[56:19.91]Why are you naked at a gun range?
[56:21.25]I don't know.
[56:21.69]I don't know the lore.
[56:31.98]Okay, hold on.
[56:33.84]My initial plan might work pretty well here.
[56:37.65]My hand needs to go down like that.
[56:39.57]Alright, everybody hold your breath for a second.
[56:47.68]Beautiful.
[56:49.00]Hold it in place, let go of this.
[56:51.64]Oh, fuck yeah.
[56:52.76]Alright, now hold on.
[57:00.18]now I just need to put this in the right spot up and like over here okay you can breathe now yeah go ahead take a nice deep breath out and then this needs to be perfectly straight just go to the left if I move to the right he moves to the right if I tilt to the left he moves to the right what are you doing
[57:33.62]Like, move your fucking hand!
[57:36.00]I hate this game.
[57:40.21]This is the worst game of the decade.
[57:59.65]I can't even bend my wrist.
[58:01.16]It's the weight of the gun.
[58:02.60]Oh, please.
[58:17.22]I can't even get the thing to stay straight.
[58:21.30]Come back over here.
[58:30.07]Try a grenade?
[58:31.45]No, I'm not quitting.
[58:32.57]I'm not quitting yet.
[58:35.03]Just because you say a game is the worst game of the decade doesn't mean that you're not going to try to win.
[58:39.13]Give me my other hand.
[58:53.82]Wait, that's not in a bad spot.
[58:56.38]Where's the clip?
[59:02.74]Alright, get it over here.
[59:09.16]I have to spin this around.
[59:13.44]You have to throw a grenade.
[59:14.77]I'm not done yet.
[59:20.09]I need to move this in a circle.
[59:23.17]With, like, my thumb.
[59:26.11]Just don't knock it off the fucking table.
[59:29.91]Alright, so that's going to be going the right way, right?
[59:36.67]Keep spinning it.
[59:42.62]Let it go.
[59:44.08]It needs to go.
[59:44.64]Alright, so shoe out, right?
[59:48.78]Forward, shoe out.
[59:49.80]Is that correct?
[59:55.70]Like the toe of the shoe here, it goes out.
[59:58.71]Tab forward, right, okay.
[60:03.53]Alright, cool.
[60:05.44]So I have to spin this.
[60:23.16]Don't fall off the fucking table, please.
[60:32.82]Alright, almost there.
[60:34.55]Alright, tab is almost going to be facing out.
[60:36.98]Grab it from... I can't... I have to make sure I grab it from the bottom.
[60:43.07]I gotta close all my fingers.
[60:46.33]Completely.
[60:47.07]And then... Because it'll get stuck.
[61:05.93]Alright.
[61:06.37]Tab is now facing out.
[61:10.76]Hold on.
[61:15.04]I should be able to let it go from here.
[61:17.42]And it won't fall off the table.
[61:18.94]But it'll be in the right.
[61:19.78]Oh my fucking god.
[61:20.54]Don't fall off the table.
[61:21.24]Don't fall off the table.
[61:21.86]Don't do it.
[61:22.64]Jesus Christ.
[61:26.40]Oh fuck.
[61:27.06]Okay.
[61:27.42]Hold on.
[61:27.80]This is important.
[61:43.70]It's going to fall off the table.
[61:45.02]It's going to 5 to use the gun.
[61:56.41]I actually am naked.
[61:57.39]You're right.
[61:57.71]That is weird.
[62:05.96]Alright.
[62:06.62]Wait!
[62:09.32]Flip it again.
[62:12.42]Now...
[62:14.18]It's almost there.
[62:21.79]Why can't I just tilt the gun to the left?
[62:27.05]There's like an invisible wall here where I can't move the gun this way.
[62:30.37]I can go literally every single other direction.
[62:39.04]Fuck you!
[62:54.30]No, not you.
[62:55.36]You.
[62:57.02]Me?
[62:57.48]No.
[62:58.14]Yes.
[62:59.95]Not yes.
[63:00.79]Not yes.
[63:01.27]This.
[63:05.81]Why is my pinky not closed?
[63:16.32]Oh, my.
[63:16.88]I don't understand why I don't get it.
[63:20.08]I can go every other direction.
[63:22.40]The gun is apparently too heavy for me to hold in one hand.
[63:36.52]Is this the new Mario Tennis?
[63:37.90]No, because everybody likes Mario Tennis.
[63:41.84]That's different.
[63:43.52]That's a different scenario.
[63:55.14]except for me I like Mario tennis I don't like I don't actually like Mario tennis I just have to say that again let me just may be very clear about this move character's arm to the right no go that way instead move character's arm in no just go that way I don't have any actual precise control of my character
[64:25.21]Sometimes he just bounces.
[64:26.87]It's over.
[64:49.44]Zero progress.
[64:50.46]Point and laugh.
[64:53.38]I'll give you a laugh.
[65:13.23]Such a fucking mess.
[65:16.15]What a mess.
[65:21.89]Look, I know this is what the game's point is.
[65:24.25]I understand.
[65:29.24]I know.
[65:31.18]I know the point of the game.
[65:35.12]It's for this scenario.
[65:36.38]This is what everybody likes and everybody wants to see.
[65:38.77]It was made for this scenario.
[65:41.75]This one.
[65:45.56]This is what you wanted to see.
[65:46.64]This is what everybody plays this game for.
[65:48.40]No one wanted to see that.
[65:49.26]That's right.
[65:49.76]Fuck, you're right.
[65:50.28]No one wanted to see this.
[65:53.70]Shit.
[65:54.94]Yeah, nobody wanted to see this.
[65:56.54]Everybody said, don't play this.
[65:57.65]This game's terrible.
[65:58.57]And I was like, oh, no, I want to do it.
[65:59.89]Yeah, you're right.
[66:00.73]Never mind.
[66:02.47]Shit, I was wrong.
[66:02.95]I'm sorry.
[66:04.37]I was about to go off on like a tangent about what you wanted to see and nobody wanted to see this.
[66:14.14]Like painting a pretend fucking narrative.
[66:18.58]And this is what you guys said.
[66:19.76]This is what you guys wanted.
[66:20.56]No, we didn't.
[66:21.98]Oh, right.
[66:23.96]What I meant to say was... Here's the fucking worst thing though.
[66:32.53]I like need to see this.
[66:34.09]I have to do this.
[66:35.57]I can't open this and then not do it.
[67:00.69]Because then I'll never live this down.
[67:03.02]You know?
[67:04.26]I'll be the one moron that opened this game and went, no, this is dumb.
[67:09.43]No, no, no.
[67:10.45]I have to do it.
[67:11.01]I have to at least load the gun.
[67:12.67]I have to load the gun.
[67:13.39]I have to load the gun.
[67:32.91]Wait a minute.
[67:39.32]Will this work?
[67:45.42]No, I didn't pick it up.
[67:48.02]Great.
[67:48.36]Yeah, it didn't pick it up.
[67:49.84]It didn't pick the fucking thing up.
[67:51.91]And now I'm on a different view.
[67:54.01]This is fantastic.
[67:55.13]Oh, good.
[67:55.61]Do it again.
[67:56.33]No, no, do it again.
[67:56.99]No, do it again.

[68:46.54]Can I save state?
[69:06.19]Get in there, please.

[70:14.74]Let go, okay.
[70:23.22]Yeah!
[70:28.29]What did I say, worst game of the decade?
[70:29.91]That's fucking harsh.

[70:37.98]Now shoot it.
[70:38.76]Okay, wait.
[70:50.22]Wait, there's been a bunch of subs that have come in.
[70:54.92]Okay, I got it.

[71:23.94]That scared the shit out of me.
[71:24.92]Okay.
[71:25.60]That's how you shoot the gun.
[71:26.44]I shot it.
[71:27.24]Alright, so I shot the gun.
[71:28.20]I did it.
[71:28.48]I have to aim it and I have to hit the target.
[71:37.59]And then I can play a different game.
[71:38.83]I'm not going to play a different game.
[71:39.87]I'm like obsessed.
[71:43.91]Look, this is the extra stream this week.
[71:45.71]We already talked about it.
[71:47.69]This is four days in a row.
[71:48.76]This is the extra stream.
[71:51.40]This stream didn't even happen today.
[71:53.32]You're all imagining things.
[71:54.24]You're dreaming things.
[71:54.94]You can't wake up from the dream.
[72:01.66]Wait, hold on.
[72:03.02]Alright, up.
[72:12.95]Alright, let's go.
[72:23.98]Alright, now I can move my hands like this.
[72:29.16]Perfect.
[72:33.10]Alright, the pinky's gonna... Okay, here we go.
[72:43.50]I'm trying.
[72:44.10]Okay, why is it... Why am I dropping it?
[72:48.22]Why am I dropping it?
[72:50.08]Does this gun weigh like 70 pounds?
[72:52.08]What are you doing?
[72:54.32]What are you doing?
[72:55.78]What the fuck is it doing?
[73:09.75]Come here.
[73:14.57]Oh!
[73:31.07]Don't do it.
[73:31.59]Don't shoot me.
[73:36.10]Okay, it can't shoot me now.
[73:45.10]Oh, it's freaking me out.
[73:47.30]Don't drop the gun.
[73:48.34]I need to... Actually, I can drop the gun over here.
[73:53.59]I'll try picking it up one more time.
[73:55.63]Don't let it go.
[73:56.27]I'm not going to let it go.
[74:01.50]What's the next gun I should try?
[74:02.58]The sniper rifle?
[74:03.24]There's no way I'm going to be able to do that.
[74:05.42]Without a single doubt in hell.
[74:09.63]Jesus Christ.
[74:17.05]I have to at least get a shot fired over here.
[74:38.51]Don't drop the gun.
[74:40.15]Don't drop the gun.
[74:45.81]It's aiming at my stomach now.
[74:47.59]This is not good.
[74:52.23]Ooh, tilt.
[74:58.34]I'm not gonna.
[75:01.60]I have to just put it back over here.
[75:06.56]It's in a bad spot.
[75:09.36]I don't like this game.
[75:10.54]I really don't.
[75:11.32]It's seriously causing me a ton of anxiety right now.
[75:14.10]But I can't stop.
[75:14.98]Alright.
[75:24.24]No.
[75:31.31]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[75:41.81]Just give me the damn thing.
[75:44.43]Chill stream, oh begalow.
[75:46.72]Whatever, I can hold it upside down.
[75:48.42]The gun still works upside down.
[76:12.92]Pick it up, grab it.
[76:15.60]Half-Life Alyx gameplay.
[76:22.34]Alright, just aim it!
[76:27.10]Did I get one?
[76:27.66]Alright, I shot him.
[76:33.96]Okay, I got it.
[76:36.37]Yep.
[76:37.91]Right over there.
[76:40.73]I got two.
[76:41.75]One, two.
[76:44.53]Okay, cool.
[76:45.65]What's the next thing?
[76:56.79]Why can I not use the... What do you mean?
[76:59.59]Why can't I spawn the other gun?
[77:06.17]You have to unlock the next one.
[77:11.47]You need points to unlock the next one.
[77:17.18]I'm gonna do this real quick.
[77:20.98]Shit.
[77:21.73]Okay.
[77:22.29]I know.
[77:22.63]I know.
[77:22.89]I know.
[77:23.13]I know.
[77:23.37]I know.
[77:23.59]I know.
[77:23.75]I know.
[77:23.97]No.
[77:24.17]No.
[77:24.41]No.
[77:24.67]No.
[77:24.81]No.
[77:24.95]No.
[77:25.39]No.
[77:26.17]Just hold on.
[77:26.75]Wait.
[77:26.89]Wait.
[77:27.03]Wait.
[77:27.19]Just hold on.
[77:27.77]Everybody.
[77:28.09]I know.
[77:28.53]I know.
[77:28.99]I know.
[77:29.25]I know.
[77:29.59]I know.
[77:29.90]But whatever.
[77:30.88]This is not even real stream.
[77:47.00]Fuck.
[77:48.50]I just realized this streamer is only in 720p.
[77:57.06]Oh no.
[77:59.60]What a disaster.
[78:05.18]I can't believe he's in 720p.
[78:07.10]That sucks.
[78:08.26]That's fucked up.
[78:15.43]Yeah, 72060.
[78:19.04]You guys know anything about bitrate?
[78:21.10]If you do a 1080 stream at like four, five, six thousand K up, unless you're at 30 FPS, that looks like shit.
[78:30.86]What, you don't know anything about bitrates?
[78:40.31]You guys want 1080p for this game?
[78:42.11]That's even sadder.
[78:47.05]The human eye can't see past 30 FPS.
[78:51.53]But that's bullshit because the human eye can see rainbows.
[78:53.89]So I'm just going to crush that right there.
[78:56.24]Put this down.
[79:03.96]Alright.
[79:05.62]Is it tilted or something?
[79:07.12]What's going on?
[79:12.44]Play feet simulator next.
[79:15.14]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[79:22.96]Imagine trying to load a gun and fire it with your feet.
[79:26.34]That would be fucking ridiculous.
[79:33.95]Speaking of fucking ridiculous.
[79:36.69]Almost.
[79:37.45]Alright.

[81:27.32]That's it.
[81:27.60]I can't take this anymore.
[81:28.42]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

[84:37.80]He's mauled?
[84:41.68]Oh, I'm upset.
[84:43.22]There's a difference.
[84:45.37]Just move the gun a little bit.

[84:48.45]Seriously.
[84:59.99]Okay.
[85:12.50]Come on.
[85:15.42]This is invisibility bullshit.
[85:31.89]What's with this invisibility bullshit?

[85:33.71]What's with the invisible wall?
[85:37.79]Oh my god!
[85:39.23]I fucking have to do it.
[85:50.61]This shit was just not even touching.
[85:51.93]It was just like an invisible wall between the two pieces.
[86:08.00]It's slow.
[86:15.50]What the fuck?
[86:18.32]Oh my fucking god.
[86:20.14]It's like playing the crane game.
[86:22.55]There's like no rhyme or reason to any of this shit.
[86:25.75]It's just take a wild fucking guess.
[86:31.05]General, please stop for the love of... Holy, stop for your health and mine.
[86:34.16]I can't take it anymore.
[86:35.42]I'm about to... Die...

[86:59.94]I had it the first fucking time.
[87:04.71]How do I, how would you even tilt?
[87:06.51]You can't even tilt forward.
[87:08.91]I can go like this, but then... I can't take it anymore.
[87:20.28]Oh my fucking god.
[87:22.28]It's just, it's so unbearable.
[87:33.34]Dude, this is the type of CIA shit that they make you do before you can, like, apply.
[87:37.49]This is part of the fucking CIA test.
[87:50.46]You want to be like an FBI agent and you have to play this game first?
[87:53.52]Then not show a single sign of emotion and get it right the first time.
[88:06.74]When am I gonna stop?
[88:08.04]I might not ever stop.
[88:20.78]It might never end.
[88:28.14]Now I need to turn this gun because it's impossible to actually spin anything in this game.
[88:32.42]You have to, like, swipe your hand on it.
[88:46.21]Alright, stop, stop, stop.
[88:47.45]I got it.
[88:47.77]It's almost there.
[88:49.95]Almost.
[88:50.45]It's pretty much perfectly lined up.
[88:53.31]Bring it up a little.
[89:03.94]What is even the problem here?
[89:09.62]What is the fucking problem?
[89:18.63]What's the goddamn problem?
[89:22.95]That's not lined up?

[93:05.72]No, we're gonna do Merry Christmas, because it's almost Christmas.
[93:15.68]How do you even play multiplayer in this game?
[93:17.48]This one's stupid too, isn't it?
[93:36.43]Yeah, you can break stuff.
[93:42.29]Can't you drive a car in this game?
[93:43.49]Wait, let me light some incense.
[94:01.77]You're ruining Christmas.
[94:03.07]It's fine.
[94:18.60]Okay.
[94:18.96]Alright.
[94:27.61]Down.
[95:21.41]Go back?
[95:23.20]How did you get back here?
[95:27.24]Because I'm addicted to pain, apparently.
[95:29.54]Oh my fucking god.
[95:30.64]Alright, I'm giving it five minutes and then I'm doing something else.
[95:34.52]No, the game's gonna crash again.
[95:43.83]Is this what you get for misbehaving in freestream?
[95:48.93]Again.
[95:49.85]Move arm forward.
[95:51.65]Arm is moving back.
[95:53.29]Move arm forward.
[95:53.95]No, I want to move back.
[95:54.83]Move arm to the right.
[95:55.69]Are you sure you don't want to move back?
[96:03.08]Why is it weighing me down the other direction?
[96:07.10]We get it.
[96:07.76]I need you to know!
[96:08.94]I need you to know!
[96:14.58]I'm a fucking radio host that keeps going over the same ad!
[96:29.41]I'm done.
[96:48.50]I do elf bowling.
[96:50.64]I did shoot the gun, though.
[96:51.86]I did.
[96:52.10]Just not at the target.
[96:58.46]Alright, now what the hell am I going to do?
[97:04.59]Why would I start Kenshi?
[97:06.93]I played it like a year and a half ago.
[97:10.71]Start new... What?
[97:19.44]Ah, here's what we're doing.
[97:21.50]We are going to start, but we're not going to finish it.
[97:25.75]We are going to start a game that I am looking forward to playing.
[97:31.20]We're going to play AMID EVIL.
[97:34.98]AMID EVIL.
[97:36.48]I did say that I wanted to start that this week.
[97:40.40]We are not going to finish it probably until next week, though.
[97:46.29]And I say that because we've got a lot of stuff going on this week.
[97:50.85]How long is the game?
[97:51.75]This is by the same studio that did Dusk, by the way.
[98:04.46]TF2, what are you guys talking about?
[98:09.55]Is this the part of the stream where we bring up games I haven't played in over a year?
[98:21.21]Farm Dynasty.
[98:23.13]No, give me one sec.
[99:04.67]Wait, how long has the stream been muted for?
[99:07.08]Did you guys hear anything I just said?
[99:10.88]Did I just unmute or did I mute?
[99:12.12]That was weird.
[99:13.32]Why is it indicating that it's on?
[99:15.02]Or off?
[99:15.32]Alright, give me one second.
[99:17.10]I gotta change some streaming stuff around.
[99:18.38]I'm gonna play a medieval.
[99:20.08]Thanks for the 10 subs for Liddy.
[99:21.91]I did fire the gun, so I did win.
[99:25.61]Thanks for the 10 community subs for Liddy.
[99:27.27]And wait, somebody else gave subs too.
[99:29.83]That I missed before.
[99:31.91]Bottled Lemon did 10.
[99:34.51]It was Snarbosis gave 10.
[99:37.41]Thank you, Snarbosis.
[99:38.25]Appreciate it.
[99:41.33]And I think that was it for community subs that came through.
[99:43.29]Alright, give me a second.
[99:45.82]Let me change some of these things around.
[99:47.00]Let me capture a new thing, and I'll be right back.
[99:48.94]See you in a second.
