[00:09.23]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:11.03]Jeremiah here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.91]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demo Knight.
[00:17.61]Well, not really.
[00:18.21]Half Demo Knight, I guess you could call it.
[00:20.18]Because I'm still using the Lock and Load.
[00:22.04]I'm not using the Wii booties like you typically would if you were using a strict Demo Knight setup.
[00:27.72]But really, though, what really is the Demo Knight?
[00:31.14]Is it just any Demoman with a sword?
[00:33.15]Or do you have to have on the wee booties?
[00:35.23]Or do you have to have a shield on?
[00:36.65]I would probably assume that if you're running around with a shield on, you are a Demo Knight.
[00:42.23]Because really, the charge mechanic and the crit you get on your melee weaponettes, you're a Demo Knight.
[00:47.54]If you got a shield on, that's the way it is.
[00:50.48]and I've actually become more accustomed to using this type of setup where you have that long range option with the Lock and Load or the Grenade Launcher.
[00:58.70]Because the Wii booties really, if you think about it, all the Wii booties are going to do for you is give you the extra 25 health and a little bit better turning accuracy.
[01:07.95]But really though, it's just the 25 health that really matters in that situation.
[01:12.45]So if you don't care about 25 health and there's medics on the team and you're getting overheal, it's okay to not put on the Wii booties.
[01:20.17]Plus, it is also going to solve a major problem that Demo Knights have.
[01:24.97]After you charge somebody, and you miss if they get away from you, you do absolutely nothing.
[01:29.99]You run backwards, or you just try and wildly madmen swing at them.
[01:35.65]And a lot of times it doesn't work.
[01:37.07]Sometimes it does.
[01:38.49]But this gives you an option to step back and go, okay, I'll pull out my gun if you're going to pull out your gun.
[01:44.95]And it also really doesn't matter if you're going to use the Default Grenade Launcher or you're going to use the Lock and Load.
[01:50.65]It's just personal preference.
[01:52.49]Let's say you tell yourself, do I want to be able to spam around this corner and then charge over there and smash somebody in their skull?
[01:59.28]Or do I want to sit back and try and get those direct shots, kind of like I'm doing, even though I am failing pretty miserably at it.
[02:06.64]Later on in the video, I do get a couple of good direct shots, but it really is just personal preference.
[02:12.63]So now I want to briefly talk about a couple of things, and not about the gameplay really at all, it's going to be in the background.
[02:18.42]I want to discuss, a lot of you guys have a bunch of concerns about the giveaway I'm doing, and I want to be very clear with this, I want to clarify this to those of you that are concerned.
[02:29.13]No, I am not quitting Team Fortress 2.
[02:32.87]I'm going to keep making videos on Team Fortress 2.
[02:35.19]I have plenty of backup items.
[02:37.03]I have a lot of people, a lot of good friends that are willing to help me with this.
[02:41.05]So do not worry about me.
[02:42.55]I'm going to be here for a long time, guys.
[02:45.23]I don't think I could even if I tried.
[02:47.03]This game has a real deep clench on my heart and my brain.
[02:51.70]I love this game way too much to quit it.
[02:54.26]So nobody be concerned about that.
[02:56.44]I am not going anywhere.
[02:57.74]Germ is here forever.
[02:59.21]Until I'm 157 years old, I'm going to keep making Team Fortress videos.
[03:05.41]So now that that is out of the way, I want to talk about the Steam Workshop thing that I'm doing.
[03:10.51]Like you all know, I have a modeler that is diligently working on these couple of things.
[03:15.83]It is not one thing.
[03:17.33]It is multiple things.
[03:19.24]And they are all for the heavy.
[03:21.56]And I'm going to make sure I make this clear again.
[03:23.18]It is not a weapon.
[03:24.60]It is not an item that you equip to gain stats or to shoot.
[03:28.76]It's not an item.
[03:30.16]It is a hat and a miscellaneous.
[03:33.41]Some of you have already started to speculate it, because I think I've talked about this before.
[03:37.89]But it's coming.
[03:39.40]It's great, too.
[03:40.54]I wish I could just show you and tell you, because I was laughing my ass off.
[03:44.92]When I saw it for the first time, at least one of the items, I was dying laughing.
[03:48.77]So expect more information and maybe even a few images in the next coming weeks.
[03:55.19]So that's all I'm going to really say about that now, but speculate away, and if you already know what it is, then congratulations, you know what it is.
[04:04.28]So let's talk about the gameplay for the last minute or so here.
[04:07.28]Playing on Upward, I think I forgot to say the map we're playing on.
[04:11.02]This is Defense on Upward.
[04:12.98]And right about now, they're coming to the last point and I'm not really doing a whole lot.
[04:18.04]I'm kind of just, oh, let me shoot over here and let me shoot over there.
[04:20.88]I'm not really doing anything.
[04:22.64]Probably should have changed to the sticky launcher at this point and taken this off, put on the default grenade launcher.
[04:28.71]But I don't do that and I end up doing pretty much nothing for the next 50 seconds.
[04:34.07]To be honest, I was being a little too overconfident.
[04:36.51]I was telling myself, no, I just gotta get one or two kills with the islander, get myself and my health up, be able to run faster.
[04:42.56]That does not happen.
[04:44.02]I act like a scrub for the remaining part of this video.
[04:48.72]So here comes my most glorious moment in Team Fortress 2.
[04:52.46]I'll make sure to slow it down, because it really is... I mean, start taking notes now, guys, because I'm the biggest pro you could ever meet in your life.
[05:00.13]So I turn around here, see an engineer building something, decide...
[05:07.61]So yeah, that's definitely something you want to do.
[05:10.01]Anytime a sentry is right next to you, shoot it and get the blast damage killing yourself.
[05:13.97]That's a great idea.
[05:16.37]So anyways, guys, this is going to be the end of the video.
[05:18.28]I go for an islander attempt.
[05:20.28]Doesn't happen.
[05:20.92]I fall down into the pit of despair and we lose the game.
[05:24.98]So thank you all so much for watching.
[05:26.76]I really do appreciate it.
[05:28.11]And I'll see you guys all soon.
[05:29.75]So take care, everybody.
