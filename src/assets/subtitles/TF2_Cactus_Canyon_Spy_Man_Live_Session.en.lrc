[00:04.53]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:06.49]Jerma here.
[00:07.07]Welcome to Cactus Canyon.
[00:08.87]This is the second of the two new maps.
[00:12.57]I just made myself very well known to the snipers over here, so I might as well try to just bait out a headshot.
[00:19.19]And he's using the Sydney Sleeper.
[00:21.19]I could have seen that by looking down at the left of my screen, but you know, sometimes you just don't pay attention, and that's exactly what happened.
[00:27.64]But anyways, I'll give you my thoughts on the map.
[00:30.32]I like this map a lot, because it reminds me of Frontier.
[00:34.18]And I don't know why, but I like Frontier a lot.
[00:36.78]I like, like, the inclines and the declines.
[00:38.58]It adds for some cool dynamics.
[00:41.66]But, um... Hopefully I don't get killed again here.
[00:45.12]Let's get behind this medic.
[00:47.22]And then this guy, too.
[00:48.47]He doesn't know.
[00:48.91]He doesn't know.
[00:49.33]He doesn't know.
[00:49.71]Back it up.
[00:50.07]Back it up.
[00:50.41]Back it up.
[00:51.75]Oh, whoa.
[00:52.19]Whoa.
[00:52.41]Whoa.
[00:52.59]Easy.
[00:52.85]Easy.
[00:53.03]Don't throw those in here.
[00:53.67]There's somebody in here.
[00:55.05]I'm trying to use the bathroom.
[00:57.79]What is going on with that door?
[01:00.75]That door is going, like, insane right now.
[01:04.26]I'm also using this thing.
[01:06.07]Pyro.
[01:07.15]Pyro.
[01:08.87]What do I go for here first?
[01:10.09]This guy.
[01:10.51]And then this guy.
[01:12.05]And then this guy too.
[01:16.16]No.
[01:16.86]No.
[01:19.02]Yes.
[01:20.18]No.
[01:21.30]Yes.
[01:21.54]No.
[01:22.38]Absolutely no.
[01:23.80]Make my way back around.
[01:25.06]Let's disguise as a spy.
[01:26.79]Don't.
[01:27.47]Don't.
[01:27.63]Don't.
[01:27.77]Don't.
[01:27.99]Don't.
[01:28.11]Don't.
[01:28.31]Don't.
[01:28.43]Don't.
[01:28.63]Don't.
[01:30.40]See if we can get that sentry before he gets it built.
[01:33.18]To level three, and I will be able to... It's okay, it's okay.
[01:38.68]One hit.
[01:40.00]Nice shot.
[01:41.38]Excellent job.
[01:42.38]Excellent job, team.
[01:44.72]You deserve a reward.
[01:45.84]Hmm.
[01:49.55]They're really far.
[01:50.11]I don't know.
[01:50.63]How are we at their spawn right now?
[01:52.03]It doesn't make any sense.
[01:58.76]The card is all the way up here, and somehow we're at their spawn.
[02:03.14]That's odd.
[02:05.76]Okay, well, just get... Watch out.
[02:08.15]Watch out for the Pyro.
[02:11.71]This is not good.
[02:13.49]I'm going on blue.
[02:13.91]We're going to do the switch right now.
[02:16.31]I can't.
[02:17.67]I can't make the switch.
[02:19.07]I'm dead here, for sure.
[02:20.37]One day...
[02:28.65]Hello everyone, it's me, the Spy.
[02:31.49]Today I'm going to be using the Kunai, the Le Charg√©, and of course my sapper, that I undoubtedly love to use.
[02:42.02]As you see here, I get covered in Jarate.
[02:44.62]It's too bad because the sniper is an asshole.
[02:47.80]He won't kill me though.
[02:49.51]I will bait him into this room, where I will keep baiting him around the corner.
[02:54.23]He will fall down, and I will shoot him.
[02:57.81]Just watch.
[03:00.41]Keep your eyes peeled.
[03:02.87]Keep your eyes peeled.
[03:04.13]Hold on.
[03:07.05]Oh, there he is.
[03:07.75]I found him.
[03:09.29]I told you he would come down eventually and I would kill him, but I didn't.
[03:12.25]That was part of the plan too.
[03:14.25]This next part of the plan is to follow the sniper up the stairs and step him in his back.
[03:20.92]See?
[03:22.04]Watch this.
[03:28.04]Shit.
[03:30.82]Whoa.
[03:31.50]Too much going on there.
[03:33.24]Too much going on there.
[03:34.02]I wonder... I'm being healed by this guy.
[03:36.14]Like, that's... How obvious of a spy am I?
[03:38.60]Hi, I'm just, like, being healed by my medic.
[03:41.97]Hope nobody heard that.
[03:43.89]Hope nobody heard that.
[03:46.57]Hope nobody heard that.
[03:50.55]Whoa!
[03:56.33]That was... Well, thanks, man.
[03:58.89]Really just saved my ass right there, Pyro.
[04:01.31]Or whoever, like, knocked me in the air.
[04:04.21]I thought I was dead, but I just wasn't.
[04:08.65]Hey, Scout.
[04:11.53]Oh, just out of reach.
[04:14.89]Still might be able to get him.
[04:16.27]Come on, I gotta land that.
[04:18.23]I gotta start landing those.
[04:19.27]Where'd the medic go?
[04:23.61]What am I doing?
[04:25.22]What's happening?
[04:26.70]What happened?
[04:27.28]I got him.
[04:28.78]Okay.
[04:30.08]A very weird chain of events is happening right now and allowing me to, like, be a moron and play Spy correctly somehow, someway.
[04:39.83]Come here.
[04:40.17]I knew you were gonna do that.
[04:44.60]I knew you were gonna do that.
[04:53.94]And the series of unfortunate things ends up getting me knocked into the... If that's not like a... That was like scripted, what just happened right there.
[05:04.54]You are... Oh no, look out, look out, look out.
[05:11.69]Haha, look at me.
[05:13.23]I'm standing on your stickies, I'm a spy.
[05:15.43]You might as well blow it up.
[05:18.31]But, blow up the stickies.
[05:20.55]Hey, look.
[05:22.83]Hey, there you go.
[05:25.98]This fall is gonna kill me.
[05:32.02]In this next clip, I'm going to show you how to properly take out a sentry.
[05:36.16]A lot of spies don't know exactly how to do it.
[05:39.78]And it gets them in a lot of trouble.
[05:42.11]As you see, I used my dead ringer to make that soldier think I was dead.
[05:46.31]But in actuality, I'm actually still alive.
[05:49.69]Come up around these stairs.
[05:51.23]There should be a health pack up here in this room.
[05:53.75]If you see another spy, give him a nod and go on your way.
[05:58.13]So taking out your sapper, move to this sentry in question and stab it.
[06:04.97]No wait, that's not right.
[06:09.19]This choke right here seriously rivals some of the craziest chokes in the game.
[06:15.09]There's only one spot that people can come through and it's right here.
[06:19.69]I just bumped into a spy, I think.
[06:21.91]Somewhere.
[06:22.87]But, man.
[06:24.29]This choke is insane.
[06:26.40]They have to come through this door.
[06:28.00]Like, how do we do that?
[06:33.36]I'm gonna have to just, like, barrel my way through everybody.
[06:36.49]I can't even do that.
[06:38.67]I seriously can't do that.
[06:41.55]I need to wait until they push out a little more and just use the revolver.
[06:46.78]I wonder if I can, like... See, this is a good time to put on the, uh... Look at this guy, just, like, dancing over in the corner by himself.
[06:56.30]Well, we're gonna go for it.
[06:57.66]Hopefully this pyro doesn't like me.
[07:02.47]And... I'm coming to pee.
[07:05.95]Nope, that ain't happening.
[07:07.99]Make our way back again.
[07:08.85]And... Rinse, repeat.
[07:13.99]Can we do it?
[07:17.05]And here we go.
[07:18.85]Nobody pay attention to me.
[07:20.85]Oh, okay.
[07:21.61]There's a lot going on here.
[07:22.59]This is going to be tough.
[07:25.15]Oh, you bumped him right into me.
[07:28.94]Oh, come on.
[07:33.60]Oh, God, no.
[07:34.88]He got in the way.
[07:40.74]Oh, get him out of here.
[07:45.99]You give me that over you give me that over and things are gonna change oh Geez oh random crits oh boy oh dear
[08:05.37]That was a there was a lot of other teammates team members whatever that didn't make it out there's a Where's this uh?
[08:15.88]Oh, it's all over here.
[08:16.62]I can't get telefragged oh Dear Let's get the little trap.
[08:29.49]That's not a very good trap That was a great trap germa very good.
[08:34.03]Oh
[08:35.49]Did I do good?
[08:36.83]Mommy, look at my finger painting I just made.
[08:39.21]I'm so bad at putting traps down in the same spot.
[08:49.21]30 seconds, 30 seconds.
[08:49.95]We can do this.
[08:52.21]Dear, that's a lot of people.
[08:57.54]This map.
[09:00.00]This map.
[09:02.28]Oh, I need heals.
[09:03.40]Oh, dear.
[09:04.72]Alright, where's my weapon?
[09:10.71]Five seconds.
[09:13.43]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[09:15.03]Not much longer, not much longer.
[09:17.19]We did it.
[09:18.25]No, it's overtime.
[09:19.21]We didn't do it yet.
[09:21.76]Now we did it.
[09:23.02]Right?
[09:23.52]Yeah, we did.
[09:25.70]You can't escape me, Scout.
[09:28.52]You can't escape me!
[09:31.20]Well, that might wrap it up.
[09:33.18]But, I do want to say...
[09:35.53]If you do want to see more just general kind of livecoms, like lightly edited livecoms, I have five dominations, right?
[09:40.98]That's impossible.
[09:42.82]That is literally, look at all our dominations, oh my god.
