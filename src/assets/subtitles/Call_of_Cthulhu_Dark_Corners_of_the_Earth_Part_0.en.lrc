[00:02.99]Okay, let's go on to the next one.
[00:07.65]Turn that off, get over here.
[00:10.26]Get over here.
[00:11.22]This next one, let's see how good this one's gonna be.
[00:18.59]It is, let me load it up here.
[00:25.66]Make sure it's good to go.
[00:26.72]Well, that's not the right... Huh?
[00:38.81]Okay.
[00:40.30]Okay, uh, that was, that was, that was not what I was expecting.
[00:45.96]Uh, and I mean, like, fucking at all.
[00:56.27]Okay.
[00:57.71]Cool.
[01:00.23]This one's not going to be around for a long time.
[01:04.13]We're not going to be around for a long time.
[01:06.22]Thank you, Mike Woodrow, for breathing into the microphone.
[01:09.72]It's Elvira.
[01:10.78]Oh, boy.
[01:11.36]I don't know about this one.
[01:12.16]It's going to be recorded in MFR.
[01:17.10]Do you wish to restore a saved nightmare?
[01:19.44]Can you guys see this?
[01:23.48]What the fuck is happening?
[01:26.59]Hold on a second.
[01:27.15]I don't think this game even works.
[01:45.30]This game doesn't work, apparently.
[01:52.25]This is called Personal Nightmare.
[02:01.93]Okay, well that... I'm not gonna relaunch it, don't worry.
[02:06.85]We just got like a scary laugh in our face.
[02:10.63]So that happened.
[02:15.15]Alright, so now let's move on to like the meat and potatoes of the stream, okay?
[02:19.63]We got through the shit.
[02:20.59]We got through like the trash.
[02:22.91]Let's load up a real deal game here.
[02:25.59]What do you say?
[02:29.34]Give me a minute.
[02:31.27]I was not expecting that to happen.
[02:37.35]Okay, here we go.
[02:39.47]The real game.
[02:44.69]Now, if one of the mods could do me a favor and change the name of the stream to Call of Cthulhu The Dark Arts of the Earth.
[02:52.33]Whatever the fuck the name of this game is.
[02:56.77]The real scary stream.
[03:05.58]This is a real game.
[03:09.52]I wonder if this works.
[03:13.09]Whoa!
[03:13.41]Sir!
[03:14.17]Madam!
[03:15.27]Hey, there we are.
[03:21.13]It's a shame I can't finish a single game.
[03:23.64]Well, I mean, half the games we've played have been games that were never intended to be finished.
[03:34.73]This game's a buggy game, that's alright.
[03:38.75]I turned it down preemptively.
[03:41.45]Hopefully that's enough.
[03:42.75]Who knows?
[03:44.04]You know with these games, it's like you're rolling the fucking dice.
[03:46.40]Alright, so I literally opened up the game just to make sure it wasn't going to blow my eardrums.
[03:55.83]Here we go.
[04:00.09]The games weren't finished themselves.
[04:02.45]Alright, Boy Scout, Private Investigator, Hardened Detective, or Mythos Specialist.
[04:08.91]I think I might just do Boy Scout.
[04:13.60]D was intended to be finished in a two hour sitting.
[04:15.94]There are no saves and the game ends after two hours.
[04:19.70]We'll do Private Eye.
[04:26.50]Compared to the other games I've played, this is a triple A title.
[04:31.61]Well, it's okay.
[04:32.05]We're going to Arkham Asylum.
[04:33.47]Is this a Batman game?
[04:35.81]Arkham Asylum.
[04:36.25]Okay.
[04:36.45]Is this like the Riddler?
[04:37.58]DC is involved?
[04:38.20]What?
[04:38.92]What?
[05:00.76]Are you certain this is actually a DC game?
[05:03.68]No, it's not.
[05:08.12]Batman took Arkham from Lovecraft.
[05:09.96]Did he?
[05:10.24]No, not Batman.
[05:12.88]Who made Batman?
[05:14.46]Stan Lee.
[05:15.10]No.
[05:16.02]Whatever the guy's name was.
[05:17.14]Batman took Arkham from Lovecraft.
[05:19.32]He was a big fan of the books.
[05:22.18]Uh-oh.
[05:29.77]This is going to be graphic.
[05:32.47]Yeah, Batman, like, was a big fan of the Lovecraft books.
[05:35.11]He made Arkham Asylum.
[05:42.08]And there he goes.
[05:47.60]No!
[05:49.16]Which one of these is the right key?
[05:51.68]Why do I have to be such a fucking janitor with 90 keys?
[05:58.48]And the book says... What does it say?
[06:03.72]Now, at my car, I can fully see my hat has... I saw walk in the shadows between wrath and his furor.
[06:11.58]I have finally given... I don't know.
[06:13.56]Something... Something deep.
[06:15.54]I have no idea what it was.
[06:23.83]Game tips are currently active.
[06:24.93]If you don't want to see any game tips, they can be turned off from the game options.
[06:28.05]You can press the escape key at any time during gameplay to access the fucking menu.
[06:33.58]Six and a half years ago.
[06:36.64]At Arkham.
[06:40.62]No, that's me reading the book.
[06:42.76]I think that's my... No.
[06:45.44]JPW.
[06:49.54]That's... This is Bruce Wayne's father.
[06:53.04]That's John Parker Wayne.
[06:56.09]This is the fucking prequel to Batman.
[07:01.71]Massachusetts, huh?
[07:06.59]J.P.
[07:07.15]Wentworth.
[07:15.06]John Batman.
[07:16.72]More Batman jokes.
[07:17.66]Oh, wait, well, it said Arkham.
[07:20.01]We're gonna be on that.
[07:20.93]So I'm the crazy guy, right?
[07:22.37]Twenty followers?
[07:23.63]On Twitch?
[07:24.33]On Twitter?
[07:24.81]Yeah, they're really doing some clickbait shit in there.
[07:27.93]Killing each other, and it's crazy.
[07:29.36]It's really like clickbait titles.
[07:49.86]Yeah, crazy gang.
[07:50.38]Do I have a gun?
[08:18.46]Okay, well, shift.
[08:19.90]Can I have shifts FOV?
[08:24.52]No, I can't have shifts.
[08:26.02]I want this FOV.
[08:27.38]I have to, like, hold my breath to get this FOV.
[08:32.25]It's much better.
[08:32.87]Oh, goddammit.
[08:41.84]Here comes a Left 4 Dead chapter.
[08:49.27]Press shift to FOV.
[08:50.19]Everyone's eyes are crazy looking.
[08:52.49]All right.
[08:52.91]See, I told you they were on Twitch.
[08:54.55]Better take it slow, though.
[08:55.89]They got 20 followers on Twitch.
[08:57.31]Uh...
[09:23.85]Uh, okay, can I have a gun?
[09:25.07]Alright, well, it looks like I'm running this way.
[09:33.58]Oh, no!
[09:34.56]We're part of one of their fucked up YouTube videos!
[09:38.77]Quick, run!
[09:39.29]Uh, what am I doing?
[09:48.26]Can I do something with you?
[09:49.16]No.
[09:53.09]Alright, I'm in.
[09:54.09]I'm in.
[09:54.35]How do I open doors?
[09:57.51]Do doors open by themselves?
[10:02.72]Shit, Phillips has been shot.
[10:04.14]He's dead.
[10:04.80]Oh god.
[10:09.80]Is there a... No, there's not.
[10:13.54]Special features.
[10:19.50]Yeah, I did go inside.
[10:21.51]I'm st- I think Walter isn't- wait, strange co- now they're talking to each other.
[10:27.76]That's simple strange.
[10:29.64]Looks almost like a flaming eye.
[10:32.18]I should take a closer look.
[10:33.84]Dude, people are shooting guns around you, like, this is not the time to stop and look at stuff.
[10:42.71]It's how you save the game.
[10:49.06]I'm done looking at the eye, like pull back.
[10:54.79]I can't... Don't look at the eye anymore!
[10:56.65]I'm done saving the game!
[10:58.27]I'd like to... I don't know if I like that mechanic.
[11:14.07]Easy.
[11:17.81]The power of the Oculus Rift.
[11:21.08]Cultist... Okay, let's push him out the window.
[11:28.82]Hey guys, it's me!
[11:30.12]Don't shoot!
[11:30.66]If something's wrong with my game, it shouldn't be doing this?
[11:41.74]Are you sure?
[11:44.08]Wait, is it like all squished?
[11:46.38]I don't understand.
[11:52.07]It shouldn't be doing this.
[11:54.79]Oh shit, how do I sneak?
[12:02.10]Behind him.
[12:04.22]Strangle.
[12:16.29]I told... Hey!
[12:18.43]I was gonna find out some information and you guys... Everyone just won't stop shooting.
[12:24.83]Hey!
[12:26.69]You know, I've been expecting you.
[12:29.63]Inspector.
[12:34.31]Anybody else that I'm going to watch get shot?
[12:39.78]Who else is going to get, like, shot before telling me information?
[12:44.18]It won't budge.
[12:46.82]It won't open.
[12:53.51]All right.
[12:53.99]Anybody, like... Okay.
[12:56.95]Anybody in, like, the chat, like... Is there, like, an unofficial patch I can get for this game to make it so I'm not going to throw up playing it?
[13:05.24]Because this is this potential here.
[13:06.58]I want to play this.
[13:14.99]Patch the door.
[13:15.97]Maybe.
[13:16.23]All right.
[13:19.25]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:21.15]Let's save it.
[13:24.66]Because I want to give this the attention I believe it deserves, you know?
[13:28.98]Saving it here.
[13:35.43]Alright, so look at me there.
[13:37.19]Hold tight, right?
[13:37.81]Hold tight.
[13:39.95]I'm going to go get it.
[13:40.51]Don't worry.
[13:42.33]I'll just turn on the webcam.
[13:44.83]You guys can look at me for a minute.
[13:47.82]Or something.
[13:48.60]Hold on.
[13:51.76]Alright.
[13:54.08]Unofficial patch there.
[13:55.84]I didn't turn the webcam on.
[13:57.22]I forgot to do that.
[14:03.73]Hi, guys.
[14:05.57]You guys can watch me get a patch.
[14:09.70]I got clothes on, right?
[14:10.54]Yeah, I got clothes on.
[14:14.10]Aquaman shirt.
[14:16.80]Pretty cool.
[14:17.46]Okay, let's go get it.
[14:23.81]Oh, my eyes.
[14:24.47]Hey!
[14:26.41]Easy.
[14:28.31]Call of Cthulhu patch.
[14:33.30]Patch.
[14:36.24]Let's see.
[14:39.30]This looks like it.
[14:46.78]Mm-hmm.
[14:53.57]Okay, so we're gonna bypass some Steam shit.
[14:58.73]Oh, Lord.
[15:04.21]Uh...
[15:06.21]Well, this is going to take a little longer than I thought.
[15:09.49]I guess there's like protection on the game that you have to bypass.
[15:24.39]I'm growing scales now.
[15:25.99]Yeah.
[15:26.95]Do I have a comb over?
[15:27.91]No.
[15:28.99]I have real hair under here.
[15:30.33]Look.
[15:31.19]It's real.
[15:31.91]It's there.
[15:32.37]I mean, my hair's receding a little bit.
[15:34.45]I mean, it's just like out of the shower thrown over on the side.
[15:40.43]How long am I going to grow my hair?
[15:41.92]It's going to get cut after this.
[15:44.32]It's a little too long for my liking.
[15:45.88]I'd rather have it like this.
[15:46.78]You know what I mean?
[15:48.28]Like that length.
[15:49.66]I just think this is out of the shower of me not caring.
[15:51.34]Alright.
[16:00.35]So I have to go here.
[16:01.29]I have to get like a replaceable executable file.
[16:09.59]Oh god, hopefully my fucking computer doesn't explode.
[16:26.83]Oh, this is gonna take, like, a long time.
[16:29.70]I might have to just, like, deal with it for a little while.
[16:31.76]Because this is gonna take, like, 25 minutes to do this.
[16:34.16]It just is.
[16:34.58]Because I have to get, like, four different files, and I'll fuck something up.
[16:41.55]Because I can't... No.
[16:44.13]It's not gonna happen.
[16:45.13]It's not gonna happen.
[16:48.65]I'm gonna get, like, a virus live.
[16:51.62]Ah, fuck.
[16:52.18]I like set all these up too.
[16:53.20]I just didn't know it was going to be like 42 FOV.
[16:55.94]I just didn't want to go in the game.
[17:00.25]We're going to, you know, we're going to go, we're going to save that one.
[17:02.23]We'll go back to that one another time.
[17:05.25]Because we'll do that one tomorrow.
[17:07.53]We'll start right where we were tomorrow.
[17:10.95]There's just not.
[17:14.81]No.
[17:16.59]Instead, we're going to move on.
[17:18.29]Yeah, we're going to do, we'll do it tomorrow.
[17:20.19]We're gonna move on to another game.
[17:22.89]Unfortunately.
[17:23.75]Sorry if you were here for that.
[17:26.06]Because it's not ready.
[17:27.32]I thought it was ready and it's not.
[17:28.46]So we're gonna play...
