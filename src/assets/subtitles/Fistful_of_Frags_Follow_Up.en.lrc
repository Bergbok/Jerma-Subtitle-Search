[00:08.97]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:10.65]Jerma here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay commentary.
[00:15.26]Fistful of Frags, what are you talking about?
[00:16.46]What's this game?
[00:17.38]Fistful of Frags?
[00:19.44]It's the title of this game.
[00:20.70]It's the actual title of this Western Source Engine shooter from the video from a couple days ago.
[00:27.03]And the reason why I'm making this video, this is a follow-up to that video.
[00:31.41]I wanted to show some good gameplay of me playing this game and talk about it a little bit more in depth...
[00:37.15]collect my thoughts a little bit rather than just like throw knives at people and stuff and this is that video.
[00:42.52]So Fistful of Frags, I'm just gonna very very bluntly say this.
[00:47.63]Although this game was originally released years ago as a Half-Life 2 mod, this port to the Source Engine and this final release, I'm gonna put in quotes, is one of the most fun, most satisfying first-person shooter experiences I've had in, like, five years.
[01:05.53]Like, that's a pretty ridiculous statement, considering the amount of AAA first-person shooters that have come out in the last few years.
[01:14.28]And there's not even a whole lot of content in this game right now.
[01:18.71]Apparently the developer is gonna add a bunch of stuff later on, but I don't know how.
[01:23.27]The game's free.
[01:25.71]This is a free game.
[01:27.09]There's no things to buy at the moment.
[01:29.33]It's just a free download and you can play it for free.
[01:32.36]There's no strings attached.
[01:34.96]It's unbelievable that this game is as free as it is, and I'm having as much fun in it as I am.
[01:41.33]And yes, the game is rough around the edges.
[01:43.60]Yes, the game is a little sloppy in some regards.
[01:45.98]But at the same time, I think that's what gives it a little bit of charm as well.
[01:51.14]The sort of strange physics that happen when you drop a dynamite on somebody's feet.
[01:55.50]The strange sort of voice lines that people have.
[01:58.39]Pass your whiskey.
[01:59.07]Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass your whiskey.
[02:01.63]I like it.
[02:02.11]I like charm.
[02:03.21]If a game has charm, I will probably enjoy it.
[02:07.27]I will probably like it more than a game that's your typical...
[02:11.02]spray-and-pray, hold-the-button-down military shooters that we've become very used to in the last decade.
[02:18.18]And that's why I love TF2 so much.
[02:20.28]Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that was just so off the beaten path.
[02:23.37]It was just so crazy to me.
[02:25.41]I just had so much charm.
[02:26.51]It was just blistering with style.
[02:29.07]I had to love it, and I had to play it, and it's become one of my favorite games of all time.
[02:32.96]Now this game,
[02:34.96]is sort of in that same category.
[02:37.04]It's not your typical shooter.
[02:38.68]When was the last Western FPS?
[02:42.08]Not third-person, because of course Red Dead Redemption would take that role, but when was the last first-person shooter Western-themed multiplayer game?
[02:49.65]There's maybe five that have ever come out in the history of video games.
[02:54.58]I can't think of any.
[02:55.64]I can think of maybe one or two that came out a long time ago.
[02:59.66]But recent, in the last ten years, this is one of the only ones.
[03:03.88]And it's pretty good, as you can tell by the tone of my voice.
[03:07.55]I've done two videos in a row on this game so far, which I don't know when the last time I did that.
[03:12.93]Can you guys think of the last time...
[03:14.75]Now here's a good indication of how much fun I've been having.
[03:17.92]I've put probably five hours so far into the game total.
[03:20.98]When was the last time I made a video about a game, and then like immediately made another video about that same game, talking about how good it is?
[03:30.22]I don't know, Team Fortress 2 and, like, Super Meat Boy.
[03:34.95]Like, some of the only ones.
[03:36.67]So you can tell I like this game.
[03:38.25]This is not just bullshit.
[03:39.83]I'm not bullshitting you that this is a good game, because I think it really is.
[03:45.28]And I just wanted to hammer that point home to you guys.
[03:47.76]Especially those that were on the fence of even downloading it.
[03:50.38]You thought, maybe it looks kind of crappy.
[03:52.22]I don't know, it just kind of looks like a shitty game.
[03:55.09]Don't let the looks deceive you.
[03:56.89]If you're into very high skill ceiling, you know, landing shots, throwing projectiles.
[04:02.49]If you're into that type of stuff...
[04:04.28]you're going to really be into the high risk versus the high reward that this game gives.
[04:09.47]Yes, it can be wonky.
[04:10.81]Yes, it can be sloppy.
[04:12.21]But still, it's got that flavor to it when you get that bang!
[04:16.23]You get that nice shot on somebody.
[04:17.85]You throw that tomahawk across the map and it hits somebody in the face.
[04:21.31]It's got a lot of awesome stuff that you can do in it.
[04:24.21]And I would say at least give it a try.
[04:25.57]At least jump into it for...
[04:27.37]an hour or so and grab some buddies and just go into the Old West and just start gunslinging.
[04:32.45]That's my advice to those that want to check it out.
[04:36.48]And to wrap this video up, I'm going to say for the next minute or so, long live the modding community.
[04:43.18]Long live modders.
[04:45.02]And if you're a game developer, and you don't want to support modders, and you think that modding is stupid or bad or ruins your game,
[04:53.64]You better talk to a handful of people, because not only is this original a mod of Half-Life 2, which grew into its own shoes here, Team Fortress was a mod of a game.
[05:04.91]DayZ is a mod of a game originally.
[05:08.65]Counter-Strike was a mod of a game.
[05:11.19]Dota, Defense of the Ancients, one of the most popular things on planet Earth in gaming.
[05:17.97]Dota, League of Legends, was started as a mod.
[05:22.40]So, my- this is just a standalone comment at the end of this video, and I've made this video be- I've talked about mods before in an entire video, so I don't really need to go into that much more detail besides the sentence I just said, but it needs to be noted that some of the most popular franchises were started as a mod, and who knows, this one could take off, it might not, but if it does, cool.
[05:46.71]And that's pretty much all I gotta say.
[05:49.19]But yes, guys, Fistful of Frags, free on Steam.
[05:51.60]Free, free, free, free, free.
[05:53.22]100% free.
[05:53.90]It's a lot of fun.
[05:54.64]I'd go get it.
[05:56.96]And that's pretty much it.
[05:58.04]And host a server, too.
[05:59.40]I forgot to mention this.
[06:00.52]This game is in dire need of dedicated servers because so many people are starting to play it.
[06:05.04]So...
[06:06.10]If you have a server capabilities, if you make servers, if you run a bunch of servers, maybe think about making one for Fistful of Frags, because I'm thinking about doing it as well.
[06:14.96]I'm not sure if that will be this week or next week or something.
[06:17.25]I need to iron up the details, but I will let you guys know regardless, and that's going to wrap up the video.
[06:20.57]Thanks for watching, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[06:22.67]And of course, take care, everyone.
[06:31.27]Pass a whiskey.
