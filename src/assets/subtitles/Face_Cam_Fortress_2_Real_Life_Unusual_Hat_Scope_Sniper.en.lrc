[00:09.20]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:11.02]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:14.80]Oh, that spy got in the damn way.
[00:16.78]The heavy just got in the way, too.
[00:19.61]Playing... What the hell is going on?
[00:21.41]Oh, it's a heavy down here.
[00:23.33]I can't even tell you what's going on right now in my head.
[00:25.41]So, this...
[00:32.82]What the hell just happened right there?
[00:35.51]Okay, so I'm wearing an unusual hat in real life.
[00:39.16]It's a burning Jerma head.
[00:40.52]They go for, uh...
[00:42.80]Like, too refined metal.
[00:44.22]They're pretty cheap.
[00:45.56]But it really hurts to put this on.
[00:47.17]My whole head gets on fire, and unfortunately you get, like, third degree burns on your head.
[00:51.11]Which is not good.
[00:52.95]But, anyways, I thought it would be funny just to have this on.
[00:55.51]Unusual hat in real life.
[00:56.85]When I saw this effect in my little webcam manager there, I had to put it on.
[01:01.67]I didn't even know it existed.
[01:03.15]But anyways, what am I doing as a sniper right now?
[01:05.72]I'm being a real... Oh!
[01:10.92]Get that guy, too.
[01:13.19]Come on!
[01:14.87]Come on, hit the spy!
[01:15.97]That is a goddamn spy, and I can't do... I'm gonna... Wow.
[01:22.25]Oh my god.
[01:24.37]Look at this banana peel.
[01:25.55]Holy jeez.
[01:28.23]That's been sitting there for like five days.
[01:30.99]I probably ate that before I went to PAX.
[01:34.65]That's pretty gross.
[01:37.19]So let's keep going here.
[01:38.31]Playing on 2-4, which... I got actually a lot of requests to do this.
[01:42.57]People want to see me play on 2-4, and I really don't think I have one video on 2-4.
[01:47.84]This is probably the only one.
[01:49.34]Maybe one more.
[01:51.66]You know what?
[01:52.16]Screw this.
[01:53.72]Okay.
[01:54.32]Don't hit him.
[01:55.42]There we go.
[01:57.54]Scope Sniper.
[01:58.16]Doing Default Sniper pretty much.
[01:59.76]We're going to get this cap right now, aren't we?
[02:02.39]We better.
[02:02.89]Are you real or what?
[02:05.25]I don't know.
[02:05.57]I don't trust anybody.
[02:07.21]Don't trust anybody.
[02:10.71]Oh, how come that didn't register?
[02:13.73]Get it!
[02:15.80]Get him!
[02:18.30]Get somebody through this little hole.
[02:19.28]I'm so scared right now.
[02:22.74]Scope sniper on two-foot.
[02:24.76]Just nonsense.
[02:26.04]That is a spy.
[02:27.76]Can't stand in the same way.
[02:28.76]What are you doing over here, man?
[02:33.52]Oh, let's just stay... Oh!
[02:37.90]God!
[02:38.48]How did this guy even get up here?
[02:40.64]How did a heavy just, like, waltz up here?
[02:44.61]Well, there's one.
[02:46.65]Let's keep it rolling here, boys.
[02:48.15]Let's eat a raw, gross, rotten banana peel while we're at it.
[02:51.31]I'm gonna throw that away.
[02:54.28]Holy... Oh, no, that's two!
[02:56.30]That's two scores right there.
[02:59.11]Alright, alright.
[02:59.73]I'm gonna go down to the bottom this time.
[03:01.15]I'm not gonna stay up here.
[03:03.25]Or am I?
[03:05.77]Ah!
[03:08.71]Get out!
[03:11.01]I'm gunning for you, you mongrels!
[03:15.11]Right here.
[03:15.53]I'm gonna stay right here for a minute.
[03:17.27]For just a minute.
[03:19.71]My unusual hat is, like, really itchy.
[03:24.59]Is nobody gonna come out here?
[03:25.47]What's gonna happen?
[03:26.25]Come on.
[03:27.23]They just capped one.
[03:29.82]Did that heavy just go all the way through and cap everything?
[03:32.27]Yes!
[03:33.63]You're gonna get it right here, man.
[03:35.57]You are getting this right here.
[03:36.63]I'm gonna shoot you right in your face.
[03:38.03]It's gonna go through your teeth and out the back of your neck.
[03:41.05]And no, it's gonna be this heavy, actually.
[03:43.69]I'm gonna get the right opportune moment.
[03:45.60]No, it's gonna be this guy instead.
[03:49.08]Hey, it still works, right?
[03:50.00]I killed somebody.
[03:51.96]Oh, you.
[03:53.52]Oh, you.
[03:54.94]Get out of town!
[03:57.44]Don't want you here no more.
[04:00.32]And you are not... Yeah, you're real.
[04:02.32]Okay.
[04:03.54]I'm okay with that.
[04:04.50]You're a real spy.
[04:05.80]Do your thing, man.
[04:08.29]What are that other... Heavy!
[04:11.55]Oh, you're dead heavy.
[04:13.59]Shboink!
[04:16.83]They're gonna win!
[04:17.85]They've capped twice now.
[04:19.71]We had two caps in the beginning.
[04:22.39]And where is this son of a biatch?
[04:26.95]I think it's time to go back upstairs.
[04:30.22]Try to defend the intelligence, because that's not gonna be good.
[04:32.68]If we just lose right now, I'm gonna be very mad.
[04:34.40]Hey.
[04:38.37]Hey.
[04:40.15]No, you're real.
[04:41.03]How?
[04:41.31]What is?
[04:42.39]What's with all these, like, crazy heavies?
[04:44.03]At least we got a sentry now.
[04:45.75]That's good, good, good.
[04:46.87]Spy is up here.
[04:48.17]Bang!
[04:52.87]Do two in a row.
[04:53.84]Whoa.
[04:56.48]Where's this guy?
[04:57.24]Come here.
[04:58.52]Come here, you.
[05:00.26]I'm gonna get this Pyro.
[05:02.34]Oh, you know what?
[05:03.04]Let's cap this right now.
[05:06.27]Come on.
[05:06.93]Support, support.
[05:09.85]Ah, I would've got him.
[05:11.73]He has no idea.
[05:13.55]Oh, baby!
[05:14.23]Oh, baby!
[05:15.43]Am I gonna cap this right now?
[05:16.99]Sniper cap for the win?
[05:18.21]Is this gonna happen?
[05:21.09]Whoa, what am I stuck on?
[05:22.23]Oh, this stupid teleporter.
[05:24.35]Oh, this is gonna be a sniper cap right here, guys.
[05:26.91]This is gonna win it right now.
[05:28.78]Hell freaking yeah.
[05:33.38]Oh, yeah.
[05:34.20]Oh, yeah.
[05:34.56]Wait, is it?
[05:34.92]Yeah, it's playing the three.
[05:37.38]Bang, baby.
[05:39.85]Well, that was a nice round.
[05:41.35]I say, uh, go grab yourself one of these unusual hats.
[05:45.09]They don't go for very much.
[05:46.71]And, uh, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[05:48.09]So, thank you guys so much for watching.
[05:50.18]Really do appreciate it.
[05:51.50]And, uh, now I gotta go douse my head in water to get rid of this unusual hat.
[05:55.64]So, uh, see y'all next time.
[05:57.60]And, of course, take care, everybody.
