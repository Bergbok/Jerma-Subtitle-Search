[00:03.08]I'm gonna find Poseidon and kill him apparently.
[00:08.60]And I've taken my boat over to this area.
[00:11.11]We'll see what's over here.
[00:13.21]Who sets foot upon the sacred isle of horses?
[00:16.05]Okay.
[00:16.43]Lord Poseidon preserves his favorite creations from the ruination of the world.
[00:21.61]To trespass here is to call down the fury of the Master of Steeds on both land and sea.
[00:27.59]Okay, uh, this guy sounds kind of like a wuss, if you don't mind me- Whoa, shit, he's attacking me.
[00:32.59]I didn't think it was gonna happen that quickly.
[00:34.73]Get him!
[00:36.09]Yeah, you wuss.
[00:39.07]Whoa, he's running away.
[00:39.75]He's running away!
[00:41.14]Pulling out my bow.
[00:42.64]I'm gonna shoot this motherfucker.
[00:43.80]Get me on this goat.
[00:46.12]Come here, you fucking master of steeds.
[00:48.84]I'll kill ya!
[00:50.94]So I do want to pop in here for like two seconds and explain sort of what's going on here post-commentary.
[00:55.62]I'll cut back to the live session here in a second.
[00:58.28]And it's gonna be a very quick video.
[01:00.20]I just wanted to show that, yes, that is me.
[01:02.38]I am the Horselord in Apotheon.
[01:04.82]It was a ton of fun to do the voice for this guy.
[01:07.14]Even though it's not very big, it's just a boss battle.
[01:10.14]It's just a little thing that you run into when you go towards Poseidon's area.
[01:14.11]If you have the game, maybe you already knew this.
[01:16.11]Maybe you were like, wait, is that fucking... Is that actually him?
[01:20.01]And yes, the answer is yes.
[01:22.07]And if you're interested in more voice stuff that I've been doing recently, if you're curious at all, the link in the description is going to go to an animation that I was in this last couple months.
[01:30.96]And it's not like a Cartoon Network or like Nickelodeon or something like that.
[01:34.10]It's just a Flash animation that I always happen to be a part of.
[01:37.12]And it's in the description if you want to check it out.
[01:38.92]It's there.
[01:39.50]Ow, my finger.
[01:40.31]I just bumped it.
[01:41.05]Ouchies.
[01:42.42]And that's gonna end this awkward post-commentary that I've cut into a live video.
[01:46.19]I don't know why I decided to do this, but I wanted to give some context, and that's pretty much it.
[01:49.79]Enjoy the live parts and bits of this video, guys.
[01:53.35]And I'll see you all next time.
[01:54.23]Take care, everybody.
[01:55.57]And let's see who wins the battle of Poseidon's horse lord versus the Partheon guy.
[02:00.26]I forgot his... Do I have to kill him on foot now?
[02:03.86]That's not good.
[02:07.22]I'm just gonna throw fire at him.
[02:14.14]acting good acting job you did there sir whoever you are I don't want to die I really think I'm gonna die here do I have any what is this I don't even know what this is I'm gonna drink it god I'm gonna die
[02:41.61]Maybe not.
[02:43.41]Can I craft anything?
[02:45.20]I can't even craft any fucking healing shit.
[02:47.72]Damn it.
[02:49.60]Dodge, dodge, dodge.
[02:50.66]I can't get killed by me.
[02:52.98]As me.
[02:53.76]That doesn't work that way.
[02:56.30]He only has like 30%, 20%.
[02:58.64]I should be able to get him.
[02:59.87]Throw some axes at him.
[03:02.59]Uh, blast arrows.
[03:03.51]We'll go with these.
[03:04.51]Oh, another steed.
[03:06.33]Give me the steed.
[03:06.89]I don't even care about this guy.
[03:09.47]Let's move.
[03:11.11]Alright.
[03:13.24]Ooh, they explode.
[03:14.16]These arrows explode!
[03:15.64]Isn't that just nice?
[03:16.60]I don't want to waste these.
[03:20.34]Ah, I have 22 of them, actually.
[03:21.78]That's not terrible.
[03:23.28]Whoa!
[03:25.74]Whoa!
[03:30.58]Shoot him, please hit him.
[03:32.78]Oh my goodness.
[03:34.26]Now my horse is dead again.
[03:36.81]I'm just gonna spam these arrows over here.
[03:38.01]I don't even know if they're gonna hit him or not.
[03:40.47]Controlling shit in this game can be difficult.
[03:42.73]At least I'm regenning my health.
[03:47.61]Get back to the spear.
[03:49.56]The farmer's pick, whatever the hell this is.
[03:51.52]Fuck!
[03:57.30]No!
[03:58.20]Don't kill me!
[04:01.27]He's getting so close.
[04:02.85]I still haven't picked up any nectar or anything.
[04:04.53]Is there any in my boat?
[04:06.63]There might be like one on my boat, and I still hadn't... Oh, nice.
[04:09.07]Okay, I can craft one.
[04:10.81]Eat it.
[04:17.19]Get these pieces of crap out of here.
[04:19.87]My beef is not with you.
[04:22.11]It's with the Lord of Horses.
[04:29.01]Couple more hits.
[04:29.99]Couple more hits.
[04:35.89]No!
[04:38.72]Shoot it!
[04:40.96]Fuck!
[04:45.66]I'm gonna come for you.
[04:46.44]You don't have very much health left.
[04:48.95]One more little tap.
[04:49.75]I've done this like four times now.
[04:52.95]I gotta kill me.
[04:58.92]Haha, I got you, me!
[05:00.68]Fuck you!
[05:02.03]Fuck me!
[05:03.45]Fuck us both!
