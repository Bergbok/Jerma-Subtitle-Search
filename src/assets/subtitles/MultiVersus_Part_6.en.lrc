[00:02.82]Nah, I'm not back yet.
[00:05.30]Not back yet.
[00:07.04]I want to... I want to refill my drink!
[00:11.71]Not quite back yet.
[00:15.15]Not quite.
[00:15.83]Give me a sec.
[00:34.02]Hold on.
[00:35.06]I'm not quite back yet.
[00:46.79]I need to refill my drink.
[00:49.47]I do have something really cool, though.
[00:51.35]I think I showed this already, didn't I?
[00:52.90]I probably did.
[00:53.70]It's cool, though.
[01:04.62]All right, actually, you know, I'll be all right.
[01:06.38]I'll be, I'll take a break in a little bit.
[01:09.00]Let's just get to it.
[01:13.47]Okay.
[01:14.71]Hello.
[01:16.19]How are you?
[01:16.87]There's that.
[01:18.77]There's that.
[01:23.23]And of course, here am I. I'm back.
[01:29.22]Welcome everybody to season two of Multiversus.
[01:35.85]It's been a while since we played this.
[01:37.41]Thank you, Warner Brothers, for sponsoring the stream.
[01:39.45]This is going to be a couple of hours of sponsored content.
[01:43.13]By the way, just in case you didn't know.
[01:47.25]What's it available on?
[01:48.05]Do we know?
[01:49.67]PlayStation, Xbox, PC, cross-platform.
[01:53.39]They just did a huge, huge internet change, and it's apparently really cool, and it's apparently good.
[02:05.21]Uh, there's some new characters we haven't played with, which I need to do that first.
[02:08.50]But yeah.
[02:09.82]Season 2, I believe, just started right now.
[02:13.94]Gonna see Marvin Martian at some point soon here.
[02:18.22]Show us your legs.
[02:19.54]They exist!
[02:22.28]Here, you wanna... You wanna see what... Okay, fine.
[02:27.65]You wanna see what kind of... You wanna see what kind of pants I'm wearing?
[02:32.95]Here.
[02:33.65]You wanna see...
[02:37.45]There!
[02:37.79]There it is!
[02:38.37]There are my pants!
[02:48.42]I ripped the leg, it's fine.
[02:49.70]These things were already ripped.
[02:55.65]Could you hear the tearing?
[03:00.81]Did it come through?
[03:06.58]Let's get to it, everybody.
[03:08.78]Okay, I actually need to practice first.
[03:11.54]But yeah, thanks again to Warner Brothers.
[03:13.10]Warner Brothers has been incredibly awesome to this channel.
[03:17.01]Let's see who's here.
[03:18.37]I know there's another Gremlins character.
[03:21.73]Which is pretty sick.
[03:23.87]So let's see who we got.
[03:26.01]They've added... Of course, there's Rick from Rick and Morty.
[03:30.85]There's Black Adam.
[03:32.69]There's... Stripe?
[03:35.37]Let me see Black Adam.
[03:37.91]What's he do?
[03:48.51]Okay, that's cool.
[03:50.33]Looks pretty good.
[03:51.29]Alright, so what about the specials?
[03:57.93]Let me read about this, because that's pretty cool.
[04:01.75]Whoa, a lot of Bugs Bunny stuff.
[04:05.46]Yeah, I'm a little rusty.
[04:09.88]But let me go to the move list.
[04:11.12]Okay, so let's see.
[04:14.50]That's a... Okay.
[04:16.14]Black Adam releases a beam of lightning to... This is just neutral.
[04:18.88]Why?
[04:20.02]Damaging them repeatedly and applying shock before tossing them either up or down.
[04:23.65]Can I choose which way they go?
[04:27.73]When the lightning hits a target, it searches for nearby targets, jumping to them to repeat the move in a chain of electric attacks.
[04:34.68]You can charge it.
[04:35.34]All right.
[04:39.03]Dash forward and is chased moments later by a bolt projectile.
[04:42.47]This bolt will reflect off the force field generated by Black Adam's grounded down special.
[04:47.29]Okay.
[04:50.15]Let's see what that looks like.
[04:52.93]So what's the down special?
[04:55.47]That stays there.
[04:56.23]And it bounces off that.
[05:04.95]So what does that do?
[05:07.43]Black Adam briefly gains the ability to fly in any direction.
[05:10.21]That's awesome.
[05:14.48]Generates an electromagnetic force that blocks enemies.
[05:16.84]That's actually insane.
[05:18.56]It blocks all projectiles?
[05:19.72]If my voice did that, it was a weird thing that just happened.
[05:22.64]Trust me, I actually think it's interesting.
[05:26.90]Alright, so what about this stuff?
[05:31.40]Holy shit.
[05:36.49]Seems actually pretty good.
[05:38.43]Lot of cooldowns, though, it seems.
[05:45.75]How long can you fly for?
[05:47.79]A pretty long time.
[05:51.37]I'll give it a try.
[05:51.83]OK, so what about who's next?
[05:58.84]Oh, there's also Stripe, which is that's definitely I'm going to play Stripe for sure.
[06:05.68]Gremlins.
[06:10.97]Already like it.
[06:11.61]Already like the moves.
[06:13.97]You know what's kind of funny?
[06:16.39]I never thought in my entire life that they would bring gremlins back.
[06:21.77]But they did.
[06:22.23]Alright, that's a pretty good combo.
[06:23.37]What about down?
[06:23.85]What is that?
[06:28.07]Saws?
[06:28.51]Alright, let's take a look at the moves.
[06:32.43]Stripe fires his gun at close range.
[06:38.48]Alright, there's a gun.
[06:39.20]I believe that means that they're targeted, okay.
[06:45.52]He will shoot at them in... Okay, if Stripe has targeted an enemy, he will shoot at them instead, regardless of distance.
[06:53.34]That just seems like a better version of Velma.
[06:57.55]Doesn't Velma put a target?
[06:59.45]Alright, Stripe charges a push with his skateboard and shoots across the area.
[07:03.11]He also can combo into a backflip.
[07:05.91]Wait, what?
[07:07.79]Oh, my God, that's fast.
[07:08.91]OK.
[07:19.05]That's terrifying.
[07:19.85]I like this character.
[07:23.60]Oh, I like this character a lot.
[07:26.72]OK, cool.
[07:27.36]What else we got?
[07:28.38]I could just kind of learn as I go.
[07:33.04]Stripe dashes upward at his target.
[07:35.08]If he hits any projectile while leaping, he will destroy it.
[07:38.50]Stripe pulls out a bundle of dynamite that detonates after a duration.
[07:42.58]Press input again to detonate it immediately.
[07:46.47]Detonating ignites and hits enemies outward.
[07:48.53]Stripe also receives damage.
[07:50.31]What?
[07:53.03]So I get hurt too?
[07:53.69]Oh, okay.
[07:59.93]Alright, I'm taking Stripe into ranked.
[08:02.15]Show Marvin?
[08:02.93]I don't know if Marvin's available.
[08:04.93]I don't think he's out yet.
[08:09.12]We have to look at Rick for a second, at least.
[08:11.12]Just for a second.
[08:37.33]Actually kind of cracked.
[08:42.23]I think I might be playing Rick Sanchez.
[08:47.73]That was funny.
[08:48.57]I'm sorry it was.
[08:49.43]That was actually pretty funny.
[08:51.15]That was funny.
[08:52.97]Yeah, it was.
[08:53.55]Alright, let's give it a try.
[08:56.90]I'm in fucking wood league, so it really doesn't matter.
[08:59.04]Let's look at the battle pass.
[09:04.82]Astronaut Velma, pretty cool.
[09:07.52]Utility belt Batman.
[09:10.32]What else is here?
[09:11.14]What's the very last thing?
[09:13.96]Shield and bubbles.
[09:16.70]I love the ring out effect stuff.
[09:19.28]What is this?
[09:24.95]What's this?
[09:25.33]Taz taunt.
[09:26.09]Taz hungry.
[09:27.21]What is this?
[09:33.53]Bugs Bunny taunt.
[09:34.29]Alright, I'm ready.
[09:34.85]I think I'm warmed up.
[09:40.51]I think I'm ready.
[09:41.05]Let's go play Wood League.
[09:42.95]I'm ready.
[09:46.33]Alright, let's get out of here.
[09:47.29]How do I get out of here?
[09:50.81]Alright, you guys pumped up for Season 2 of Multiverses?
[09:52.91]Let's go!
[09:56.62]Top 10 most pumped up moments.
[10:02.28]They added a bunch of weird shit too.
[10:04.10]This is cool.
[10:05.38]Arcade Classic.
[10:08.65]Yeah, like look, there's like weird, like silly mode.
[10:10.53]We definitely have to play silly mode.
[10:14.59]Let me get back into, should I do ranked?
[10:16.47]This is going to be so embarrassing.
[10:17.57]All right, I'm going to do ranked one-on-one and it's going to be a disaster.
[10:25.47]Should I warm up first?
[10:27.55]No, we're going right in with Stripe.
[10:30.83]Let's go.
[10:31.35]I'm ready.
[10:37.84]I think I got... It's like riding a bike.
[10:44.86]Yeah.
[10:48.18]Silly mode activated.
[10:49.04]I wonder what it is.
[10:52.40]There's a level... I don't have any perks.
[11:00.16]Oh, this is going to be a disaster.

[12:05.33]Oh, that move is going to be so cool if you can hit it.
[12:19.19]Ooh, I can throw blades, too.
[12:24.29]That's cool.
[12:29.66]I just hurt myself.
[12:33.46]Oh!
[12:34.00]How am I still on the stage?
[12:45.62]That's crazy.

[14:24.23]It's a warm-up.
[14:24.57]It's the first match I've played in like three weeks.
[14:26.81]I did pretty good.
[14:31.25]That wasn't bad.
[14:31.91]That was the first match I've had in like three weeks.
[14:33.25]Let's go again.
[14:44.86]You lost to an Xbox player?
[14:46.46]So what?
[14:48.24]Who should I play with?
[14:51.10]I'm going to stick with Stripe.
[14:53.50]No, no, no.
[14:53.93]We should change it up.
[14:57.57]Bugs.
[15:02.01]I got perks on bugs.
[15:07.49]Level 11.
[15:11.36]I was pretty good with...
[15:14.28]What's the name there?
[15:16.51]Gizmo.
[15:19.95]Yeah, go ahead and bet.
[15:22.93]Hey, the rust is going to shake off here, and I'm going to do just fine.
[15:29.26]Uh-oh, he's bringing out the main.
[15:37.87]I got one minute.
[15:43.54]I don't want to get... This is a nice controller.
[15:44.87]I don't want to mess it up.
[15:45.47]All right, let's go.
[15:46.63]No more messing around.
[15:47.70]Check this out.
[16:18.33]Here we go.
[16:28.19]All right, bring it back.

[17:29.14]It's alright.
[17:29.96]It's alright.
[17:31.18]I got plenty of time.
[17:46.83]Don't do anything stupid.
[17:47.89]I got the advantage here.
[18:00.13]There it is.
[18:00.55]Alright, we're good.
[18:01.03]We're good.
[18:01.49]We're getting it back.
[18:02.59]Winner.
[18:03.29]Winner.
[18:03.89]Winner.
[18:04.61]Winner.
[18:07.46]This is ranked, man.
[18:08.24]I gotta get out of wood league.
[18:13.52]Next.
[18:14.92]Continue.
[18:15.84]I mean, we gotta go for the whole thing, right?
[18:17.78]Okay.
[18:20.82]This is it.
[18:26.85]Come on, pick.
[18:28.48]Do I stick with bugs or should I go... No, I gotta stick with what I know, right?
[18:35.64]Hmm.
[18:38.48]Land the first knockback.
[18:40.24]Alright, cool.
[18:44.52]I'm gonna stick with bugs.
[18:47.48]It's like riding a bike.
[18:48.28]I remember all the moves.
[18:52.91]Go with Rick?
[18:53.47]I don't know anything about Rick.
[18:55.85]I would have to go not in ranked.
[18:58.64]Just kind of joke around with it.
[19:04.10]That's why you have to practice.
[19:06.46]Yeah, I'm doing it right now.
[19:09.26]All right, let's see if I can pull this out.
[19:13.08]Let me get into my zone here.
[19:16.53]All right, let's go.
[19:18.89]Like my eyes are bugging out of my head.
[19:20.55]All right.
[19:21.59]Just let's do it.
[19:23.83]Where's my audio?
[19:26.95]Alright, this is the Rick Sanchez level.
[19:35.58]Gotta keep the pressure up.
[20:08.22]Shit.
[20:48.18]Oh, it's going to come.
[20:57.19]Bad.
[21:00.19]Come on, come on.
[21:00.99]Sweaty hands.
[21:03.63]I won't make that mistake again.
[21:06.33]Clear the way.
[21:09.49]Sorry, not today.
[21:33.23]I know I had to beat you, but you still make me laugh bugs Was that as a dog toy you had
[21:57.76]I could never make that sound ever again if you told me to, right?
[22:01.80]I gotta turn the camera off for that.
[22:03.48]The camera's not linked up to anything.
[22:05.90]Good game, good game.
[22:09.81]What did that even sound like?
[22:11.03]Ah!
[22:17.13]Ah!
[22:31.48]Multiverses is on the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC with complete cross-platform.
[22:38.12]By the way, season two is out now.
[22:43.45]And it's pretty damn fun.
[22:47.61]All right, I'm going to do... Gizmo was fun.
[22:55.91]Let me see if I can remember how to play Gizmo.
[22:57.33]Not doing ranked.
[22:58.33]We're just going to play normal.
[23:01.36]I don't think I'm ever coming out of wood league.
[23:08.87]Let's do normal.
[23:11.19]And... Let's just... Maybe... No, not silly mode yet.
[23:14.57]Not silly mode.
[23:16.11]Let me try stripe again.
[23:25.71]Why did he squeak?
[23:27.71]I don't know.
[23:30.34]I couldn't make that sound ever again.
[23:35.55]I'm telling you, even if you... It doesn't matter what would happen here.
[23:40.09]So I'm trying to think of the combos to do with Stripe.
[23:57.60]It seems to be you want to get the target, up, up, up, juggle, and then do an up smash.
[24:07.18]Okay, let's go for it.
[24:34.07]What the heck?
[24:36.33]What was that?
[24:40.17]What happened?
[24:45.09]Stripes fun.
[24:47.47]Do you want to go again?
[24:48.73]Or start over?
[24:51.93]Nah, I'm good.
[24:52.69]Okay.
[24:54.25]Well, thanks for playing.
[24:58.93]I guess that was... We got it.
[25:03.44]I'll take the win, whatever.
[25:07.39]Ooh.
[25:09.85]Do I have any points?
[25:17.94]No.
[25:19.86]It's okay.
[25:24.06]I'm never doubting ever again.
[25:31.99]Thanks for the refund.
[25:32.85]Oh, yeah.
[25:33.69]I mean, yeah, sometimes it doesn't count, right?
[25:42.12]Is the chatbot working, by the way?
[25:43.28]Let me make sure it is.
[25:44.12]Should be, I believe so.
[25:55.29]Okay, it should be popping up.
[26:00.39]Alright, this is versus a high level Shaggy, so I gotta be ready for this.
[26:05.19]Trying to learn Stripe.
[26:07.71]I'm a Gremlins franchise only player.
[26:09.75]Oops.
[26:37.48]Yay, one eye run out of moves!
[26:38.92]How did that block?
[27:28.15]Don't!
[27:28.75]I got perfect.
[27:32.26]You lose.
[27:38.04]Oh, he got owned.
[27:38.88]Yeah, this is a Shaggy that knows what he's doing.
[27:40.88]Continue.
[27:41.48]Let's go!
[27:42.54]I got a better idea.
[27:50.48]Pulling out the LeBron.
[27:51.96]Come on, pick characters.
[27:58.94]Do I have this?
[28:01.10]Oh, I don't have that.
[28:01.94]Oh.
[28:04.68]Right choice.
[28:05.94]Only choice.
[28:07.56]Oh, no.
[28:08.16]Why?
[28:08.46]I'm ready.
[28:24.27]Oh, let me pull this one out.
[28:26.81]Start time.
[28:36.10]Yeah, there's a new battle pass.
[28:37.69]Is that part of a battle pass?
[28:39.07]All right.
[28:45.11]Let's see if I can pull this out.
[28:49.33]I lost the ball already.
[28:59.67]Oh, man.
[29:00.31]This is bad.
[29:01.07]It ain't over yet.
[29:41.13]This guy's a good player.
[29:44.53]This guy's not in wood league, okay?
[29:48.76]It ain't over.
[30:08.65]It ain't over.
[30:09.27]It ain't over.
[30:22.34]Oh, I'm just getting comboed.
[30:26.40]Oh, he's mad.
[30:28.90]So am I. Let's go, man.
[30:40.07]I just fucking freaked you out for no reason.
[30:43.11]No, I want that.
[30:43.78]I need that ball.
[30:46.66]Fucking with the guy in wood league.
[30:59.88]What the fuck?
[31:08.18]Okay.
[31:12.29]Whatever.
[31:14.95]Okay.
[31:15.75]Whatever.
[31:16.31]Your eyes popped out of your head.
[31:23.72]Dude, you fell off.
[31:27.96]I'm just fine.
[31:40.83]Does he realize he isn't?
[31:41.79]No, no, no.
[31:42.45]I don't want to play ranked because I don't want to go up against people that can beat me bad.
[31:54.39]I got to stick with one character and play.
[31:57.73]start time we're gonna stay on stripe we're not moving off stripe for at least 25 minutes okay
[32:59.71]What's going on?
[33:00.87]Oi!
[33:29.56]Oi!
[33:30.62]Stop!
[33:32.36]Don't taunt!
[33:33.10]Don't taunt!
[33:33.54]That makes me angry!
[33:34.22]Oh!
[33:41.19]Oh!
[33:41.89]Oh!
[33:42.13]Oh!
[33:42.39]Oh!
[33:58.31]Yeah, I mean, there's a spider in the room.
[34:03.04]A huge spider just went down.
[34:16.06]You can't revoke my gamer license.
[34:17.75]That's not fair.
[34:18.61]I gotta get, like, a few warm-up games in.
[34:23.81]And I am so red.
[34:25.65]And it's because they can't... Hold on.
[34:28.77]I'm not this red, I swear.
[34:30.53]Look at how red the room is!
[34:33.39]Am I emanating heat?
[34:36.10]From my body?
[34:36.84]I'm not red!
[34:42.96]My room is red!
[34:44.06]I'm not heating up the room, right?
[34:45.67]Alright, okay, it's against level 8 Morty.
[34:49.61]Everything's gonna be fine.
[34:52.33]Oh, shit.
[34:57.95]I'm starting to get it.
[34:58.75]We'll be good.
[35:02.37]You should stand up.
[35:05.73]No, I'll fall down.
[35:08.35]I'll be good.
[35:08.77]We just gotta warm up a little.
[35:10.06]I'll get a few wins.
[35:10.68]Alright.
[36:04.16]Is that a grenade?
[36:04.70]There's too many places to fall down.
[36:39.21]Damn it!
[36:41.75]Oh my God, we're on a boat!
[36:46.77]Just focus on the mission, all right?
[37:41.77]Red point!
[37:42.13]Red point!
[39:01.92]Got it.
[39:04.38]That felt good.
[39:07.65]That felt good.
[39:10.53]That felt good.
[39:11.97]Our Dean.
[39:19.32]Yeah!
[39:21.22]Somebody said I move around too much.
[39:25.24]I know.
[39:25.96]I do.
[39:32.43]Again, Season 2 is out.
[39:33.79]It's on everything.
[39:34.51]PC, Xbox, PlayStation.
[39:37.11]You can play this complete cross-play.
[39:40.89]It's all there.
[39:43.07]Season Pass is available right now.
[39:50.04]I like Stripe.
[39:51.16]That's going to do better.
[39:58.71]This was the Rick who gamed on you, is it?
[40:03.27]I gotta get my revenge.
[40:04.30]This is the Rick who absolutely just dunked on me?
[40:39.69]Oh, it worked out!
[41:07.30]Oh, what happened, Rick?
[41:10.60]I'm Mr. Beastie.
[41:17.73]I'm Mr. Beastie.
[41:26.77]Oh, look at that.
[41:29.78]That was cool.
[41:43.41]I sustained a lot of damage.
[41:48.54]I'm pretty close to death.
[41:50.10]Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[42:17.81]That's not even fair.
[42:20.66]Whatever.
[42:21.04]I mean, it's just well known that Rick is a complete hard counter to Stripe.
[42:35.05]We all know that.
[42:48.38]Ooh, what'd I get?
[42:55.40]Oh, wait a minute.
[42:57.34]Ooh, I got the Astronaut Velma.
[43:02.21]Cool.
[43:08.71]I'm biting my lip too much.
[43:13.76]Profile.
[43:14.16]50 coins.
[43:22.20]I feel like I would like Batman a lot, but I just never get many time at all.
[43:25.66]Okay, this is up next.
[43:31.94]Maybe I should change some stuff up here.
[43:41.33]This is not okay.
[43:42.35]Do you remember when I played last time and I had like an 80% win rate?
[43:46.43]I've played like five games.
[43:48.53]That's like only today.
[43:49.19]That's today.
[43:55.67]What do I got?
[43:56.15]That's cute.
[44:01.00]I'll do it.
[44:14.56]Somebody said, can you please do the stripe impression?
[44:21.52]Yeah, sure.
[44:28.85]That'll be a thousand dollars, please.
[44:36.18]I'm kidding.
[44:37.24]Don't do that.
[44:50.23]Start time.
[44:57.92]That's not worst impression.
[44:58.98]That was pretty close.
[45:36.87]Both had the same idea.
[45:37.74]Both brilliant players.
[46:23.46]I'm getting too fancy.
[46:24.40]Don't get too fancy.
[46:25.46]Just play.
[46:50.14]Oh, I got her off first.
[46:51.04]That's horseshit.
[46:55.61]Ooh!
[46:55.91]Snipe!
[46:56.31]Stripe is fun!
[47:05.86]You're sim- what?
[47:21.02]Why are you squirming around?
[47:22.32]Whenever I play a game like this, my whole body has to move back and forth.
[47:26.04]I just have to be- I'm inside the game.
[47:29.88]You guys remember back in the day when they talked about those, oh, like, oh, you can wear this thing that when you get hit, you get hit.
[47:36.85]They, like, toyed with that idea.
[47:38.71]Like, it was like a dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun or something, right?
[47:45.13]I feel like I have one of those on.
[47:50.16]Let's go back to Bugs for a little bit.
[47:53.53]I do want to mess around with Black Adam, though.
[47:56.89]Seems like his moveset's pretty fun.
[48:02.53]Maybe Velma?
[48:05.88]Maybe, yeah.
[48:14.08]I played Stripe for 25 minutes.
[48:17.28]Alright, no more like high stress.
[48:19.60]I feel like I've warmed up.
[48:20.68]I feel like I'm good to go.
[48:32.89]Don't let him do that!
[48:38.94]What's happening?
[49:07.57]Keep letting him do it.
[49:27.46]Careful.
[49:28.20]Blow point.
[49:30.09]Blow point.
[49:30.85]I totally let you win that game.
[49:42.84]Oh, I thought I could just drain them.
[49:44.02]All right.
[49:49.34]Okay.
[49:50.29]All right.
[50:25.01]Oh, sandwich versus pie!
[50:59.43]Don't let him do that!
[51:07.71]I'm not playing it up.
[51:08.72]I genuinely move around.
[51:10.12]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[51:18.30]Am I like moving too much?
[51:23.42]That was a good fight.
[51:24.16]That was very good.
[51:26.12]Stop pretending.
[51:29.94]I'm not pretending.
[51:32.66]Ooh.
[51:35.70]What's this?
[51:42.07]Ooh, a shaggy ring out.
[51:47.83]I'm curious about what that is.
[52:06.08]Ooh, that's cool.
[52:09.90]Also cool.
[52:12.32]Oh, that's cool too.
[52:15.86]Didn't I?
[52:16.20]What did I get?
[52:16.64]I'll do this one.
[52:22.02]This one looks good.
[52:32.42]Alright, one more.
[52:37.28]one more wait what's this I don't want to activate that yet okay one more of these we'll do a little bit of silly mode you're doing video game commercial acting you mean when they're like this and they're like oh whoa and they're pressing buttons really hard it really ah whatever
[53:08.39]Whatever, it's fine.
[53:17.80]You need something blowing in your hair too.
[53:24.79]Make it some fuel in me.
[53:27.87]This level is really hard.
[53:31.46]I think there's some new maps too, right?
[53:37.81]Alright.
[54:10.93]Come on, let me play!
[54:35.71]Ooh, the snipe at the end!
[54:40.25]Oops.
[55:39.09]See?
[55:53.16]I just had to play a few games.
[55:55.72]Everybody said, oh my god.
[55:57.04]This dude is awful.
[55:59.02]I can't believe this guy thinks he can play this game.
[56:01.51]This is a joke.
[56:03.41]What do you think you're doing?
[56:04.45]You gotta warm up a little bit.
[56:12.89]I'd be careful where you put your uh channel points at this point guys uh you're too confident now that's it that's good I have a little bit of confidence
[56:45.12]Dude, you're still in plastic league.
[56:49.18]That's alright.
[56:49.74]I'm still going somewhere.
[56:52.78]You go from water to wood to plastic to steel to bronze.
[57:00.07]I got a long way to go.
[57:03.17]What did I just do?
[57:07.39]Come on, pick character.
[57:15.74]Skipping cardboard.
[57:22.58]Dude, I guarantee you if I grinded rank, I would just be at bronze two.
[57:30.34]I would always win one, lose two, win two, lose two, win one, lose three, win three, lose four.
[57:38.67]I would never climb.
[57:41.90]I can never get something going where I win like 10 times in a row.
[57:45.86]I would always be bronze two or bronze one.
[57:56.53]I get in my own head way too much in competitive games.
[58:01.58]Because I start doing well, and then I get a little bit too comfortable and relax a little bit.
[58:05.44]And then, no, no, no.
[58:06.22]I lose two in a row.
[58:07.48]Then I get angry.
[58:09.32]And then try as hard as I can for the next two.
[58:11.89]Win both of those.
[58:12.69]Get confident and comfortable and relax a little.
[58:14.63]Lose two in a row.
[58:15.31]Are you not fighting me?
[58:25.08]Okay.
[58:25.70]Are we playing?
[58:28.22]Okay.
[58:28.92]We're playing.
[58:29.56]We are playing.
[58:39.04]Risky!
[58:39.52]Ooh!
[58:43.38]Blue point!
[58:46.24]Low point!
[59:07.91]Did someone say Scooby Snacks?
[59:13.40]I almost had it.
[59:23.10]Did you actually get that off?
[59:24.28]How did I not hit you?
[59:33.10]Winner!
[59:33.82]Winner!
[59:34.42]Winner!
[59:48.79]Let's do it.
[59:49.27]Alright.
[59:50.43]Look, you gotta learn how to play.
[59:53.49]I have to learn how to play.
[59:54.31]I'm gonna play Black Adam.
[59:56.68]Wisely.
[60:05.47]You don't know.
[60:05.91]Who knows?
[60:06.47]You know, sometimes you have bad games.
[60:08.25]Sometimes you're trying to learn a character.
[60:09.59]Hey.
[60:11.15]Hey.
[60:12.22]Relax.
[60:13.16]Okay.
[60:25.84]Oh, you're looking for a mirror.
[60:26.74]I have no idea how to play Black Adam, but we'll try.
[60:39.71]Don't get cocky.
[60:42.89]I'm not gonna... Okay.
[60:57.46]Somebody just wrote, am I banned?
[61:00.37]Just testing to see if you're banned in the chat.
[61:13.17]Okay, here we go.
[61:14.30]See, we're good.
[61:31.33]Black Adam is disgusting!
[62:04.57]That's my bubble, get out of it.
[62:09.33]We were just like two dogs playing.
[62:22.54]Just like, we're gonna play, we're running around having so much fun.
[62:25.52]Stop.
[62:26.98]Okay, let's go again.
[62:46.07]Oh, we just died.
[62:49.99]Okay.
[62:50.67]That was fun.
[63:02.30]That was fun.
[63:03.50]It's a fun game.
[63:04.50]It's a fun game.
[63:05.00]People are going to play the fun game.
[63:06.28]Oh my goodness.
[63:06.88]I'm so sorry.
[63:13.45]I have warmed up.
[63:18.97]Do silly mode?
[63:19.59]How about one more with Stripe?
[63:25.56]And then we'll do silly mode.
[63:32.10]Does Stripe have an announcer pack?
[63:34.42]Because I have to have it, if that's the case.
[63:42.44]What's this?
[63:47.46]That's... Ooh, that's good.
[63:51.06]Any time, or three seconds after knocking back an enemy with a projectile.
[63:56.72]That's pretty good.
[64:05.95]Okay.
[64:15.78]Uh, this is a level 13, uh,
[64:19.40]garnet so I'm gonna be prepared I don't really know garnets but I forget garnet's moves and we've got um the home field advantage here this is uh it's gonna be hard
[65:09.60]Alright, that was an extreme move.
[65:11.08]I will agree.
[65:13.39]I'm on a ride right now.
[65:14.69]This is the multi versus carnival ride.
[65:16.69]Alright, focus.
[65:27.58]Don't do that.
[65:55.12]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[65:55.76]No!
[66:29.89]How many people can take down a fiend ship?
[66:31.32]Nice work.
[67:07.32]Music is an expression of love.
[67:09.48]Now these are moves.
[67:11.94]My moves are for more than fighting.
[68:01.36]That was such a good match too.
[68:10.95]Dude, you're a freak.
[68:25.25]Okay, I gotta bring out something good.
[68:38.96]Prepare for my death defying exploits.
[69:04.93]Okay.
[69:08.37]What's wrong with him?
[69:09.77]I'm gaming, man.
[69:25.43]Yeah, we'll do silly mode after this.
[69:34.35]Alright, level 19 Batman.
[69:35.39]I gotta be prepared.
[69:42.98]You guys having fun?
[69:48.92]What happened?
[69:49.66]Alright, should I do... We'll do silly.
[69:53.34]Alright, silly queue.
[69:54.96]Do we have to pick rules or what is silly mode?
[70:01.02]There's also a, I think, versus an arcade mode versus boss or something.
[70:06.66]I want to see what that is too.
[70:15.27]I don't know why I left.
[70:19.65]Okay.
[70:21.01]So it's a 2v2 silly mode.
[70:30.87]Yeah, I'll do some 2v2s now.
[70:34.25]Refund the points.
[70:36.75]Did it go through?
[70:43.80]I did.
[70:44.08]Okay, good.
[70:51.74]What is this?
[70:54.66]Okay, I'm not going to almost fall off the stage and squeak.
[70:58.91]I'm going to be relaxed and we're going to play.
[71:02.90]Okay.
[71:10.64]Four ring outs.
[71:16.40]What?
[71:16.78]Okay, so we just have big heads?
[71:19.36]Why did Morty already lose?
[71:28.32]I don't think Morty's here.
[71:31.82]This is truly silly.
[71:45.22]Last box is shrinking.
[71:54.07]Well, we have I don't want to end silly mode right now.
[71:56.73]Oh man.
[72:03.47]Okay, that... This is a literal 2v1.
[72:22.42]That Taz was actually holding pretty well.
[72:25.72]Yeah, I don't think we continue this.
[72:29.63]I think we go do it again.
[72:37.15]Get some gold.
[72:37.73]Nice.
[72:49.66]Forget how to play with Gizmo, but it's silly mode, so it's okay.
[72:59.21]Yeah, we don't run bets on silly mode.
[73:11.14]Do a gizmo impression?
[73:12.74]No, I did a stripe impression.
[73:13.76]Everybody told me it was embarrassing, so why would I do another one?
[73:29.42]Do it now.
[73:40.69]All right, level 19.
[73:41.17]Well, it doesn't matter.
[73:42.69]It's silly me.
[73:45.89]I remember Gizmo being really fun.
[74:00.22]Okay.
[74:02.82]Okay.
[74:13.16]Oh yeah, then you shoot the popcorn.
[74:14.98]I remember, okay.
[74:19.02]Isn't there also a little car too?
[74:20.48]Yep, there is.
[74:21.07]I loved Gizmo.
[74:30.91]Dude, I'm giving my teammate a bunch of... a bunch of juice or whatever that was.
[74:53.92]How do I shoot the bow and arrow?
[74:55.34]I forget.
[74:55.66]Is it down?
[75:01.22]Up?
[75:02.44]How do I shoot the bow and arrow?
[75:11.97]Come here.
[75:16.99]Take some of this juice.
[75:25.60]Right bumper?
[75:27.42]Oh, that's what it is, right.
[75:28.23]Okay.
[75:29.11]Where the hell is it?
[75:34.49]Was this TV?
[75:50.76]Oh my goodness, where was I going?
[75:52.24]It's too silly.
[76:18.34]There it is.
[76:18.64]All right.
[76:18.88]We brought it back.
[76:19.36]Brought it back.
[76:22.82]Come here.
[76:23.08]Take this juice.
[76:24.86]There it is.
[76:25.38]Give me a hand here.
[76:30.69]Give me a hand here.
[76:31.15]Who am I talking to?
[76:37.67]We got it.
[76:38.45]Give me a hand here.
[76:42.45]Juice over here, man.
[76:44.61]Nobody can hear me besides you guys.
[76:53.87]Alting.
[76:54.23]Okay.
[77:05.02]So what's, let me see the other mode.
[77:11.01]See this arcade classic?
[77:13.43]Play a series of enemies that will take you on a journey across the multiverse.
[77:16.91]Do you have what it takes to make it to the end?
[77:21.32]Three stages, unlimited tries.
[77:22.60]Let's do medium.
[77:25.45]What is this?
[77:27.33]Arcade?
[77:28.83]I wonder.
[77:37.99]So it's in adventure mode?
[77:46.98]Okay.
[77:51.95]start time okay so let's see what this is I'm interested stage one of five
[78:31.60]Sorry, kid.
[78:32.16]I know you got this game for Christmas, but... Try to rank up here.
[79:25.09]I know I'm doing the I'm trying really hard face, but I kind of am.
[79:36.82]Oh, that was it.
[79:47.95]There it is.
[79:48.37]By the way, the game's also free to play.
[79:53.49]You can get it right now.
[79:55.79]Season 2 has officially launched Xbox, PC, PlayStation.
[79:59.98]Can I hear it, please?
[80:13.64]So it's just another round?
[80:14.58]I'm curious what happens at the end of this.
[80:17.80]Do you get experience?
[80:34.09]I will say, let's be completely real.
[80:38.28]I have never played an online fighting game.
[80:40.66]I would have never played this ever again.
[80:42.04]Let me be very honest.
[80:43.03]Like, I don't really play fighting games.
[80:46.61]I don't.
[80:48.97]The netcode of fighting games is always unbelievably awful.
[80:53.85]This game...
[80:55.54]It feels like I'm not even playing it online.
[80:57.74]It feels like I'm playing it and the person is sitting next to me in the room with a controller plugged in.
[81:03.62]It's just... I'm telling you that's what it is.
[81:07.46]I've never played a fighting game that was like that.
[81:10.28]I've never done it.
[81:11.24]It's never happened.
[81:12.78]I always play a fighting game online, have half a second of input delay, and fucking never play it ever again.
[81:18.11]I'm just telling you the truth.
[81:19.27]That is what has happened.
[81:26.45]Being able to play this game and not have to think, oh, I have to do my moves like a second early.
[81:32.95]I can't do it.
[81:33.45]I have to be completely honest.
[81:41.02]That's honesty.
[81:42.02]It is.
[81:45.14]When I play this, when I'm playing online, it feels like the person I'm playing against is sitting right next to me.
[81:50.35]And we're trash talking a little bit.
[81:57.92]I don't know what magical powers it takes to get the game to do that.
[82:01.06]I heard it's very difficult to get it right.
[82:03.70]And it's very, very good.
[82:20.43]Yeah, rollback netcode.
[82:22.05]It's just good.
[82:24.25]I would not make that up.
[82:25.53]I'm serious.
[82:27.58]The last handful of fighting games that I ever played, I was just like, I don't want to do this.
[82:31.72]It's horrible in my brain.
[82:33.38]I can't do it.
[82:33.94]Alright, so what's the question mark mean?
[82:49.17]Dude, we believe you.
[82:51.15]You don't believe me.
[82:51.99]You don't understand.
[82:52.72]Start time.
[83:00.85]The Gremlins movie is so good.
[83:02.89]They're both good.
[83:03.51]Gremlins 2 is better than Gremlins 1.
[83:05.87]Gremlins 1 is a little more serious than Gremlins 2, but Gremlins 2 is just a big comedy show.
[83:19.64]Feral Gizmo.
[83:44.02]He's a good player.
[83:44.76]Trying to bait me.
[84:14.09]I gotta learn how to use the saws better.
[84:17.06]I feel like I haven't been utilizing very well.
[84:43.66]Do I do that I feel like I'm hearing myself Didn't I do that I do I like just kind of scream make weird sounds like that don't I I
[85:13.64]Oh, shut up.
[85:15.21]Not you, not you, him.
[85:25.79]Oh my god, I lost the computer.
[85:35.99]I just wasn't paying that much attention.
[85:40.81]okay let me let me just get I'm gonna get to that all right let me get to the end of this so just let me pay attention now in my brain I didn't want to try so hard that people like dude why is he trying this hard against a bot like dude relax you know this is not a player like why are you trying so hard so then I pulled back a little ended up losing because of that start time but now I'm mad
[86:16.76]OK.
[86:18.40]Here we go.
[86:26.51]Check this out.
[87:22.75]Low point!
[88:19.57]Goodbye.
[88:22.59]Where's the commentary?
[88:27.50]There's no commentary on these.
[88:44.65]Okay, so I'm almost done.
[88:57.61]Trying hard against a bot?
[88:58.67]Well, I want to beat this.
[88:59.63]I don't want to have to retry twice.
[89:01.63]Bro is mashing buttons.
[89:12.56]You know what the worst part about what you just said was?
[89:15.58]I know that you can tell when I do that.
[89:18.16]Because you hear the...
[89:24.14]Because I can hear it.
[89:24.78]I wish I could turn it off.
[89:25.86]Because I don't want... I like having it on.
[89:28.52]Because I like to know when I'm not supposed to be doing something.
[89:30.81]But I just don't want you to know that I'm messing up.
[89:32.97]You know what I mean?
[89:35.55]It happens all the time.
[89:38.05]I don't want you to know that I screwed up.
[89:40.03]Does that make sense?
[89:41.74]Even though it's an incredibly useful feature.
[89:44.12]I'm going to make sure it doesn't happen this time.
[90:18.34]Is it weird that ever since I've been really conscious of you saying that, I've been playing better?
[90:21.36]Because I don't want you to hear this.
[90:34.85]Because that's what you hear the whole time I
[91:06.69]You got in my head and I heard it and I... Alright, I'm not even listening to that person.
[91:23.09]Jesus, Jeremiah, I'm sorry.
[91:24.31]No, it's all good.
[91:31.06]Your head moves around when you do it.
[91:32.34]Imagine being at a poker table.
[91:37.98]Oh, I got pocket aces.
[91:44.72]I would be terrible at poker.
[91:53.87]Yeah, I would get pocket aces.
[91:59.95]I'd have sunglasses on, a hat, hoodie, a zip-up, and pocket aces.
[92:08.68]I would just stand up and be like... Look at that.
[92:13.58]Look what I got.
[92:15.88]I wouldn't be able to contain it.
[92:18.34]I would turn around and look under again and be like... I would just be a weirdo and people wouldn't know.
[92:26.82]But I would also do that if I had a 3 and a 6.
[92:32.30]That would work, wouldn't it?
[92:33.16]Do you think that I could do pretty well in a tournament?
[92:36.06]If I had a three and a six and I did that, I got up and did a bunch of movements, pointing, pointing, tipping the hat and shit, do you think it would work?
[93:08.79]Oh my god, why are you so huge?
[93:12.11]What?
[93:12.73]How did you get that?
[93:14.69]Is that part of this?
[93:31.82]Somebody said I can throw the dynamite.
[94:03.19]I have before.
[94:03.83]I think I dropped it.
[94:22.50]Aye!
[94:23.00]One more tap.
[94:36.86]Come on, dude.
[94:37.49]Get out of here.
[95:18.46]Oops!
[96:01.39]Alright, good.
[96:04.19]Was it raid?
[96:05.79]Who raided?
[96:06.15]Somebody raided?
[96:09.53]I can't see.
[96:10.67]Who raided?
[96:11.91]An engineer?
[96:27.07]Thanks a lot.
[96:27.57]Appreciate it.
[96:27.85]I don't know why I can't see it.
[96:32.37]Okay, everybody.
[96:39.99]There's no... No, I don't... No, Raid Song.
[96:41.30]No, Raid Song.
[96:43.44]You guys are digging up memes from 2021.
[96:44.62]Alright, so I just did it.
[96:47.84]That's cool.
[96:48.10]Alright, I want... Let me do some team action here.
[96:59.19]Teams...
[97:01.72]I'm not doing ranked.
[97:02.62]I got absolutely dunked on.
[97:04.08]I got destroyed.
[97:05.84]You should do another meme funeral.
[97:14.64]I forgot about that stream.
[97:20.25]The thing is, though, it worked.
[97:24.85]That worked.
[97:33.23]Alright, this is 2v2, I think.
[97:42.92]Why do you hate fun?
[97:44.96]I don't.
[97:45.34]What?
[97:45.52]I love fun.
[97:56.07]Hmm.
[98:06.04]That's kind of good.
[98:16.68]This has got to be one of the wildest group of characters to be in the same room.
[98:22.39]It's pretty crazy.
[98:24.17]Bugs Bunny, Harley Quinn, Stripe from Gremlins, and Arya Stark.
[98:32.37]It is very, very interesting.
[98:35.78]Winter is coming.
[99:05.96]I went right into that.
[99:06.84]Get him out of here.
[99:20.67]Get him out of here.
[99:22.81]Get him out of here.
[99:23.41]Got it.
[99:39.12]Where'd he go?
[99:43.72]Shit!
[100:10.75]Don't say he's so bad.
[100:11.93]That's the thing that makes every streamer angry.
[100:13.53]Hmm.
[100:43.74]I don't know how to play with Rick, but we're gonna go.
[100:45.12]Alright, if I win, I'm gonna do a huge Rick leg.
[101:00.48]That, like, big yell.
[101:04.51]Would you guys still be here if I do that?
[101:17.61]Somebody said yes, unfortunately.
[101:19.33]All right, focus time.
[101:27.04]This fight will be immortalized in story and song, or at least a nice vase.
[102:16.21]How have I only been doing the same attack?
[103:08.29]Here we go.
[103:10.29]All right.
[103:10.57]It's tied up.
[103:11.84]It's all set.
[103:12.42]It's tied up.
[103:12.96]I just put the sandwich down.
[103:15.52]Okay.
[103:34.04]Keep the pressure up.
[103:34.70]Pressure.
[103:35.00]Pressure.
[103:43.94]Good.
[103:44.34]Keep it up.
[103:46.09]Just get the bugs.
[103:47.91]I don't know what he does for moves.
[103:58.67]We're good.
[104:00.73]We won.
[104:03.62]I said I was gonna stop screaming yeah I feel the same way may we never meet again continue
[104:31.45]I don't care, whatever, fuck it.
[105:02.78]I got it wrong.
[105:06.20]Doesn't matter.
[105:16.19]It's alright.
[105:22.35]I thought I had it lined up right.
[105:23.85]I didn't.
[105:24.45]It's alright.
[105:33.29]Start time.
[105:47.01]Remember, why did you eat all my peanut butter?
[105:51.31]I mean, peanut butter lasts a long time.
[105:53.09]Alright, let's do it for real.
[105:54.23]No more messing around.
[105:55.95]Just try to hit my own teammate.
[105:57.30]Things are going great.
[106:20.55]so much going on here
[106:56.53]Don't get up there.
[106:59.45]Don't even, don't even think about it.
[107:02.37]I'm afraid that's not the will of the gods.
[107:11.06]Okay, duck.
[107:12.80]You got me fair and square.
[107:18.21]That's gonna haunt you in the morning.
[107:26.24]Can I hit the Jake with the mallet, please?
[107:30.00]Hey!
[107:56.11]Thank you, Wonder Woman.
[107:56.93]I really appreciate it.

[108:10.23]Red point!
[108:10.83]Red point!
[108:13.77]I'm fine.
[108:14.48]Happens all the time.
[108:17.76]What's up, Doc?
[108:27.73]Dude, I can't hit anybody.
[108:30.25]Why did that mallet not hit?
[108:31.89]I don't understand it.
[108:33.17]Why?
[108:36.37]Okay.
[108:51.05]Crunchy or smooth peanut butter?
[108:53.15]Smooth every time.
[108:55.69]Smooth every single time, no matter what.
[109:03.82]Hey, good fight.
[109:04.34]Alright, we're going back to strike.
[109:12.71]We're going back to 1v1s.

[116:31.65]Wrong button maybe?
[116:32.25]He's playing really well.
[116:41.98]I feel pretty good in that one.
[116:45.84]Jeremy, please, if you keep your head still, I will give you 100 subs.
[116:53.75]How do we determine that?
[116:55.19]If I did it right.
[116:55.85]I don't think I can do it.
[117:00.91]You caught him jumping.
[117:01.79]Oh, okay.
[117:02.85]So you didn't have a second one left?
[117:06.66]Okay, so... Wait, wait, wait, we gotta do this right.
[117:09.92]We gotta do this right.
[117:24.32]I just need like a shape.
[117:46.59]And I want you guys to really, really pay attention to this.
[117:49.03]It needs to be like a bright red.
[117:55.65]Okay.
[117:56.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[117:57.07]You know what I mean?
[118:06.02]I have to make it so... Right?
[118:09.54]Because if I come out of these lines, then it's over.
[118:16.02]We'll do it.
[118:16.54]Next one.
[118:16.96]Next one.
[118:17.26]Next one.
[118:19.56]Next one.
[118:26.32]Next one.
[118:32.58]Oh my goodness.
[118:33.36]What were we just doing?

[118:42.12]You want to play on the fucking edge?
[118:43.34]Come on to the edge.
[118:44.14]Let's do it.
[118:45.06]Come on.
[118:45.38]Come out here.
[118:46.40]Come out here.
[118:53.24]Stop taunting me.
[119:33.11]Okay, that wasn't even a real fight.
[119:57.22]No, I'm sorry.
[119:57.72]I have something to do.
[119:58.70]That was... Mr. Pancake, you're very good.
[120:00.90]That was very good, but I need to go back.
[120:03.24]Because I need to go back.
[120:06.93]Good luck in the rest of your fights for the rest of the night.
[120:12.55]I have something important to do.
[120:14.25]I'm going to try to make 100 subs here.
[120:25.13]Okay, so...
[120:27.62]Let me get this straight.
[120:28.50]So if I'm like here, right?
[120:31.46]We have to make the camera big.
[120:33.04]So you can actually zoom in and see it.
[120:36.65]And thin enough.
[120:41.05]How much room do I get?
[120:44.63]Is this okay?
[120:45.97]Or do I have to not move at all?
[120:47.43]Like completely still like this.
[120:48.65]Just not move from here.
[120:54.85]Is that alright?
[120:55.61]Right here?
[120:57.98]Because if I come outside of the lines here, that's it, right?
[121:00.63]Are we good?
[121:06.07]Tell me if I'm in the right spot.
[121:09.11]Let me itch my face, because I'm going to freak out halfway through this.
[121:14.01]Okay.
[121:16.10]Is it okay?
[121:22.00]Okay, so don't move from here.
[121:28.75]And I get 100 subs.
[121:52.98]Don't move.
[121:53.44]I'm not.
[121:53.90]I'm not.
[121:54.34]I just was looking to see who was in the right spot.
[121:56.44]Show them what we got.
[121:57.64]Okay.
[122:03.58]You got this?
[122:04.04]I'm gonna try.
[122:15.78]Don't mess with me, man.
[123:00.69]Guys, I fucking hate this.
[123:03.08]I need to move!
[123:33.39]I lost?
[123:34.01]What?!
[123:40.29]No, I didn't!
[123:40.95]Yeah!
[123:58.45]Wall to blue!
[124:01.54]Did someone say Scooby Snacks?
[125:04.77]You know what a harder thing?
[125:18.98]You know how you would guarantee that you would win that bet against me?
[125:24.69]I'm going to make a screeching sound through my throat with my mouth closed at the end of every match.
[125:31.29]That's how you win.
[125:33.03]That's a guaranteed victory.
[125:42.72]I'll try it one more time.
[125:48.24]Here comes the heat.
[126:01.55]Is that alright?
[126:18.59]Right there?
[126:26.14]Your ears poking out?
[126:28.24]I thought I just got an EXE crash.
[126:30.74]That's what I thought that was.
[126:31.60]Because I wasn't looking.
[126:36.93]Your hair is out?
[126:37.55]I mean, that... There's nothing I can do about that.
[126:42.03]Hair doesn't count.
[126:42.61]No, it's like my head and face.
[126:44.11]Okay.
[126:49.73]Okay.
[127:29.32]I don't care.
[127:29.72]I don't care.
[127:30.58]I just don't care.
[127:36.15]It hurts to do that.
[128:03.90]I don't care I'm sitting doing this like lock my head in place routine and I can't play the game get these out of here no I don't want to turn the stream off
[128:33.95]Alright.
[128:35.09]Last game.
[128:35.57]This is going to be the last game.
[128:44.34]This is it.
[128:44.94]I'm going to try as hard as I can and I'm going to try to win.
[128:50.21]Rule of thirds.
[128:52.99]Here comes the heat.
[128:55.12]Yeah, again, thanks, uh, Warner Brothers for sponsoring this part of the stream.
[128:58.68]Uh, I genuinely do really like this game.

[129:03.90]It's been out for a while.
[129:05.73]Season two hasn't, but season one has.

[129:13.61]There is a current season, uh, game pass, right?
[129:25.54]Have you been losing for fun?
[129:26.54]No, I was playing something else earlier.
[129:31.56]You don't play it without being sponsored.

[129:58.08]It's the same Mr. Pancake.
[130:01.17]Let's go on a good one.
[130:02.45]It's a mirror.
[131:04.54]Come on really Holy shit, how are you still here?
[131:20.05]Oh My I am so confused right now.
[131:28.75]Oh
[131:33.10]Get off the stage.
[132:18.93]Ooh, the spike.
[132:22.19]That's a good one to go on him.
[132:30.46]That was unfortunate.
[132:32.26]Yeah, let's do another one.
[132:34.06]One more.
[132:36.26]Ended up getting right to the edge of the right right when I did the down and just caught him at the perfect angle.
[132:42.16]That was painful.
[132:44.82]I would have been annoyed at that one.
[132:59.15]Changing to Shaggy, okay.
[133:07.51]Game has cross-play.
[133:08.47]Yeah, it does.
[133:13.60]You might run into somebody on the Xbox.
[133:15.26]You might run into somebody on PC, PlayStation.
[133:23.38]Will he win the final match?
[133:24.64]We'll find out.
[133:59.14]Careful, careful.
[134:35.42]Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[134:41.26]Fine.
[134:47.85]I threw so hard there.
[134:48.69]Yeah, one for blue.
[134:55.75]Man, that like clearly hurt.
[135:28.98]Oh, where you going?
[135:29.78]Don't even think about it.
[135:30.76]Oh, my God.
[135:35.39]He beat me.
[135:48.73]Shit.
[135:50.22]Oh, rematch.
[135:50.88]One more.
[135:51.30]It's one to one.
[135:51.96]Come on.
[135:52.26]We're not doing it like that.
[135:56.68]That stage is hard because all the stuff on the edge.
[135:59.37]All right, I'm fine.
[136:00.53]I'm fine.
[136:01.17]We're going to win.
[136:01.81]Here comes the heat.
[136:15.43]Okay.
[136:21.15]Everything's good.
[136:24.39]Okay, I understand he tries to bait you to the edge of the map so he can do the step move.
[136:30.99]And he tries to jump out all the way and do like the... That's not happening.
[136:35.62]Sorry, it's just not.
[136:38.60]Last match of the night is right here.
[136:39.74]Okay.
[136:48.93]Ahem.
[136:53.12]Yeah, I'm hungry!
[136:54.82]For action!
[136:55.93]Yeah!
[136:56.39]Wall to globe!
[136:57.25]I'm back again!
[137:29.51]That's it.
[137:35.65]He jumped so far out, man.
[137:44.54]He did a max jump then another max jump.
[137:48.50]Don't look at that.
[137:51.28]Good matches, though.
[137:52.12]Good fight.
[137:53.22]Good fight.
[137:55.24]That was tense.
[137:56.56]I could feel that.
[137:59.32]I toasted back.
[138:03.22]This game just does it to me.
[138:04.16]I just get so intense when I play this.
[138:07.49]It just hits me in a certain spot.
[138:09.55]And I'm not even that good.
[138:14.49]Some people that are so good at this game, they can just do so much cool stuff.
[138:17.90]Alright, one more funny one, right?
[138:20.74]Let's just do like a joke one.
[138:34.74]Are you over COVID yet?
[138:36.62]I've been testing negative, so that's good.
[138:38.20]I definitely still feel a little sloppy.
[138:42.87]My throat still kind of messed up.
[138:48.67]I'm a little tired still, but I am, I would say operating probably like 80% at this point.
[138:54.85]Show them what we got.
[139:00.81]Did you shave your eyebrows?
[139:02.15]What?
[139:04.02]Oh, no.
[139:08.70]Thanks for watching, though, guys.
[139:14.37]Let's give it a go.
[139:15.65]I haven't played Taz in a while.
[139:43.81]Blue.
[141:48.78]W-I-N.
[141:49.66]I told you we got this.
[141:52.38]Good fight.
[141:56.62]Is Taz a dog?
[141:57.48]Taz is a Tasmanian devil.
[141:59.52]Continue?
[142:05.98]Alright, that was fun.
[142:07.22]One more for old time's sake?
[142:08.14]Alright, fine.
[142:08.94]One more.
[142:12.46]Here comes the heat.
[142:16.14]I want to get at least one good LeBron game in.
[142:19.04]I tried to play him in the first 10 minutes and I just was bogus.
[142:31.76]Oh, Tom and Jerry.
[142:32.32]I haven't seen one of these.
[142:34.80]Pretty rare.
[142:51.55]Is there a Stripe announcer pack?
[142:52.55]There actually might be.
[142:54.28]I'll go check that out before I leave.
[142:58.66]So if you guys are curious what we're doing, we'll be back on Monday.
[143:03.22]I think we're going to continue the Sims 4 McNulty arc.
[143:10.53]That's what's happening on Monday.
[143:11.47]So that should be fun.
[143:19.19]Alright, this is truly the last one, even if I lose.
[143:26.97]I screwed it up.
[143:27.67]I was trying to do this.
[143:30.04]And there goes the second ball.
[143:31.34]Great.
[143:31.72]Good start.
[144:00.36]I got no games on LeBron in the last, like, month.
[144:03.44]There's no way I'm going to be able to pull this out of my, you know.
[144:12.44]Oh!
[144:48.10]Alright, it's not over.
[144:48.86]It ain't over.
[145:07.61]I don't understand.
[145:08.99]I turned into Mario.
[145:10.77]I literally turned into just a frozen frame.
[145:13.25]Like jumping.
[145:14.55]What happened?
[145:16.39]I turned into one frame.
[145:20.38]I was just like... I just went... That was ridiculous.
[145:53.41]Level 10 is for the big perk, right?
[146:02.68]I am so sweaty right now.
[146:09.97]You gonna try God of War?
[146:11.87]Um... I gotta play the first one through all the way.
[146:14.95]I only played the first 4 or 5 hours of the first one.
[146:17.93]Well, the new first one.
[147:00.44]God, I can't move.
[147:01.20]Big point for red.
[147:02.24]My god.
[147:50.93]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[147:51.69]Appreciate it.
[147:53.95]I ripped my... I ripped this out halfway through when I turned around.
[147:59.88]I ripped out my headphones accidentally and I couldn't hear anything.
[148:02.62]I didn't say anything.
[148:03.40]One more.
[148:05.40]No, that's it.
[148:05.98]No, no, that's it.
[148:06.56]That's it.
[148:07.02]That's it.
[148:07.32]That's it.
[148:12.91]Dude, how does he keep... He does this weird rocket move that I land on top of and I just keep soaring into outer space.
[148:25.63]Damn.
[148:25.77]Good game.
[148:32.60]Nah, that's it.
[148:33.38]That's it.
[148:33.78]I had fun.
[148:35.06]I had my fun.
[148:44.08]Immediately following this one.
[148:45.96]Is it?
[148:53.94]Immediately concluding this match, that's the end of the stream.
[148:58.00]I'm going to lock in for this one.
[149:07.66]Okay.
[149:09.78]All right, locking in.
[149:13.95]Play Jack 2?
[149:15.71]I've never played those games.
[149:23.72]Alright, here we go.
[150:31.49]I'm going for red.
[151:13.86]Blue.
[151:53.03]Yeah, that was fucking wild.
[151:56.07]Oh, that was tight.
[151:58.20]That was very tight.
[152:01.02]Good match.
[152:02.10]I thought I lost that one for sure.
[152:04.38]I thought I was done.
[152:05.12]I thought I was dead in the water.
[152:06.08]All right.
[152:19.45]Alright.
[152:20.93]Thought about it for a second.
[152:22.85]He thought about it.
[152:27.35]I feel like... I might see him.
[152:29.03]He might change up.
[152:33.03]We gotta go to sleep?
[152:34.99]Yeah, I mean, you can't go out on that one.
[152:36.21]This is a... Oh, no.
[152:37.53]Okay.
[152:43.42]I mean, when you're in a match like that, that's a best of three.
[152:46.26]You know what I'm saying?
[152:46.84]It's not that late.
[152:50.21]Show him what we got.
[152:52.29]7 PM Pacific.
[153:00.91]Can't go out on a heater.
[153:04.97]Well, I mean, it's just this.
[153:05.89]That was a good match and it's like one to nothing right now.
[153:08.37]We just gotta make it happen.
[153:09.33]Let's go.
[153:36.80]Damn what a move
[153:59.48]HE'S TOO GOOD!
[154:00.46]That was... That's cheese.
[154:02.46]I got cheesed!
[154:03.44]I got cheese... I got cheese-caked!
[154:05.54]That was a cheesecake move!
[154:09.63]That was a good match.
[154:14.19]That was a really good match.
[154:15.09]We're gonna do one more.
[154:17.67]I, um... Very good.
[154:20.84]Very, very good match.
[154:23.68]You got me?
[154:25.78]Now it's time for me to get serious.
[154:41.60]I can't just leave.
[154:42.50]That guy just absolutely slam dunked on my head.
[154:45.72]Shattered the rim.
[154:47.12]All the glass just fell all over me.
[154:48.72]I can't just go out on that.
[154:49.92]He slam dunked on my head.
[154:53.78]It's one to one right now.
[154:58.80]Okay.
[155:06.83]You need to take the L?
[155:07.63]It's one to one.
[155:09.17]Nobody's believing.
[155:09.77]Alright, you gotta believe.
[155:12.59]I know that trick now.
[155:13.54]I'm not going to fall for that trick.
[155:14.46]This is it.
[155:15.24]This is the one.
[155:16.70]The stage.
[155:17.64]I don't like this stage.
[155:18.31]Here we go.
[155:18.55]3, 2, 1, action.
[156:11.44]Why did I press... My fingers are so greasy, everything's falling off the controller.
[156:19.59]You have no idea.
[156:45.99]He's just going to the game.
[156:47.03]He's just going to the game.
[156:47.81]He plays a lot.
[156:50.80]He's just going to the game.
[156:51.78]He plays a lot.
[156:53.00]That's it.
[156:53.26]Here comes the heat.
[157:17.50]Alright.
[157:18.86]It's been fun.
[157:22.32]It's been fun.
[157:22.76]Let me just wipe all the water off the controller.
[157:27.56]Can't go out on a loss.
[157:36.71]Just polish this up a little.
[157:42.15]You can't leave us like that.
[157:43.45]No, I can't.
[157:43.87]You're right.
[157:44.13]You're right.
[157:51.60]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[157:52.58]It's alright.
[157:58.72]Why am I so addicted to this game?
[157:59.78]Because it's fun.
[158:14.15]Alright, no, those are some good games.
[158:15.69]That guy was really good at the game.
[158:18.39]He was just a better player and he got the opportunities, you know, like the catch down, like, you know what I mean?
[158:22.86]Just was a good player.
[159:15.35]No, he fucked me up!
[159:18.10]Get away from the edge!
[159:18.88]I have a terrible edge game.
[159:20.28]It's like the worst part about all of my gameplay.
[159:52.01]All right, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[160:08.62]That sounded like a seal.
[160:12.36]Stop, this is a close game.
[160:22.68]Stop.
[161:17.29]Check it out.
[161:18.33]We only get stuck.
[161:20.05]Remember, you're supposed to hit the other player.
[161:21.73]I want that person timed out for one second.
[161:29.77]Okay.
[161:35.33]That was fun.
[161:35.93]This game's really fun.
[161:39.53]Got really into it.
[161:43.33]Tried.
[161:44.78]Alright, I gotta call it.
[161:45.70]I gotta call it.
[161:46.66]I'm getting too addicted.
[161:53.71]That's it.
[161:55.13]You can't end on a loss?
[161:56.27]Yeah, I can, because it's quite a few games I play ending on a loss.
[162:05.99]The last few really brought my thing down.
[162:11.10]Alright.
[162:12.36]That's it.
[162:13.42]I'm gonna look at the battle pass for a second.
[162:19.54]That's a lot of fun.
[162:20.14]I don't really play video games that well, right?
[162:26.24]But when you sit down and you play a game like this and you just try hard, you get into it, you get like, ugh.
[162:33.30]It's a really great feeling.
[162:35.78]Good games.
[162:36.60]All the players, you deserve your wins.
[162:41.43]That was a lot of fun.
[162:42.03]And Warner Brothers, thank you again for sponsoring.
[162:43.83]It's so much fun.
[162:45.97]I'm happy to do it.

[162:51.60]I feel like they're fun to play.
[162:54.28]Big, huge thank you to Warner Brothers again.

[163:05.39]It's on everything.

[163:07.43]It's Season 2 right now.
[163:08.57]I think Marvin Martian is coming really soon.
[163:11.60]The netcode is phenomenal.
[163:13.92]I think it's really worth playing.
[163:16.87]I genuinely believe that.
[163:19.17]Thanks again, Warner Brothers.
[163:21.37]Thanks for watching.
[163:22.01]Thanks to you for watching as well.
[163:24.57]And I'll see you guys on Monday.

[163:33.02]Is it on Xbox?
[163:33.64]Yep.
[163:35.86]We'll go back to the McNulty family.
[163:39.98]And I need to go take a cold shower because I am sweating.
[163:44.66]It was a lot of fun, though.
[163:48.09]Looking forward to what season two has to offer.
[163:49.79]And that's it.
[163:59.67]Appreciate it, everybody.
[164:08.98]Yeah, I'm definitely feeling better.
[164:10.66]So... We'll see over the next couple days if I get back to pretty much normal.
[164:17.62]Again, grottobeasts.net There's a sign up there.
[164:21.59]We're really trying to figure out how much inventory we're going to need.
[164:26.17]So if you really do think you're going to want it, go sign up on that page because we need to figure out how much inventory we need.
[164:33.99]That's coming very soon.
[164:37.28]Keep an eye on the Discord as well because the end of the year awards nomination is going to open.
[164:42.23]The categories will be there just like previous years.
[164:44.87]So keep an eye this weekend on the Discord.
[164:46.65]We will obviously be able to be announced for it.
[164:49.07]And I'll talk about it later too.
[164:50.89]This coming week on Monday.
[164:52.83]See you for The Sims 4.
[164:59.25]And we also got a Christmas stream.

[165:17.80]same time.
[165:18.26]We're trying to beat the internet crashing, so... And all of you that stayed and stuck around for the Multiversus stream, I appreciate it.
[165:28.60]Hope it's still fun to watch.
[165:30.07]It's definitely fun to play.
[165:38.29]And I'll see you later.
[165:39.07]Good night.
[165:39.61]Goodbye.
[165:39.91]Take care.
