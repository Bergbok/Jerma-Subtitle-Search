[00:08.85]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11.21]It's Grandpa here.
[00:13.05]And today, I want to show you my... How I run a restaurant!
[00:19.63]So the game is called Papa's Berseria.
[00:22.38]It's a really fun game.
[00:23.64]You run your own simulated restaurant.
[00:25.98]It's a fast food joint, which I love those.
[00:28.16]So let's get started here.
[00:29.60]Gonna get my first customer.
[00:31.20]Let's go!
[00:33.32]So here's our first customer.
[00:34.72]Kind of looks like me.
[00:36.45]He looks just like me.
[00:37.91]Alright, so you want a cheeseburger with some green stuff, some white stuff, and some onions.
[00:44.43]That seems easy enough.
[00:45.51]Okay, let's go over here.
[00:46.84]I know we go over to the grill station.
[00:49.66]Oh, the only thing that's over here is bologna.
[00:53.16]There's no such... I don't think we have burgers here.
[00:58.67]So, sir, again, I have to apologize.
[01:01.29]We do not have any burgers, but I gave you a bologna sandwich.
[01:04.77]Hopefully you like... You didn't like it.
[01:08.77]No tip!
[01:09.69]No fucking tip!
[01:11.84]You know, some people will say this game is hard.
[01:13.98]This game's actually pretty fucking easy.
[01:16.36]Like, take a look.
[01:17.32]You just drop the stuff on here.
[01:18.68]This is what she wants.
[01:19.92]You got the tornado.
[01:20.76]You got the grunion.
[01:22.16]That's it.
[01:22.64]It's so easy.
[01:23.57]Put the ketchup on there.
[01:25.29]And there you go, missy.
[01:26.69]Here, just take it.
[01:27.45]Put the bun on.
[01:29.36]Easy peasy.
[01:30.62]This game is fucking easy.
[01:33.60]What did you want, sir?
[01:35.66]Sir, I tell you, you can't yell at me like this.
[01:38.23]I just don't know what you want.
[01:39.39]You want pickles on it?
[01:40.17]I want some barbecue sauce on mine.
[01:41.71]Are you listening to me?
[01:42.75]Hey, shut the fuck up back there, alright?
[01:45.11]I can hear you.
[01:45.77]You don't have to scream at me.
[01:47.15]Oh, Jesus.
[01:47.59]Oh, God.
[01:47.89]This is so stressful.
[02:04.63]Oh dear.
[02:06.88]Whew.
[02:08.80]That was a good dump.
[02:10.30]I'll tell you right now.
[02:12.38]All employees must wash hands, huh?
[02:17.45]I never wash my hands.
[02:19.15]Let's touch some people's food now.
[02:22.61]Hey, how you doing?
[02:23.67]What can I get you, miss?
[02:24.59]Yes, hi, how you doing?
[02:25.51]I'd like a regular burger with some tomato, some onion, a little bit of lettuce, a medium well burger, please, thank you.
[02:32.56]A little bit more onion, a little bit more lettuce, and can you please toast the bun, please?
[02:36.96]Thank you.
[02:37.42]Yes, yours absolutely, sweetheart.
[02:40.98]Toasted fucking bun.
[02:41.98]I'll give you a toasted fucking bun.
[02:48.13]Flipping those patties, oh so right.
[02:51.24]You don't wanna screw up anybody's order tonight.
[02:54.94]Because if you do, you're gonna get fired from this job that you need so much.
[03:01.44]Excuse me.
[03:02.04]Where do you go to find the ketchup?
[03:05.30]It's sitting right in front of you, you don't know that much.
[03:08.45]And you squeeze from your bottom to make sure it all comes out to bake.
[03:13.75]Where's my phone?
[03:14.49]Hey, I was having a fucking moment right there.
[03:17.81]Alright, just want to be clear on this right now, because there is some confusion.
[03:21.34]You did not want a complete head of lettuce between two pieces of bread?
[03:26.40]No.
[03:27.38]Well, what the fuck did you want?
[03:29.75]Look, I get it.
[03:30.57]I understand you're upset.
[03:32.15]It's taking a while to get you food.
[03:34.09]Everybody chill out and just listen for a second.
[03:36.42]Nobody cares, okay?
[03:38.28]They're right back at you, dickhead.
[03:40.10]But anyway, I am the only person working here.
[03:43.30]Don't you see that?
[03:44.52]My boss is a cheap son of a bitch.
[03:46.38]He's not gonna hire anybody else.
[03:47.84]I'm doing the books, I'm doing the cashier, and I'm doing the cooking.
[03:51.54]How fucked up is this?
[03:53.38]Actually, it is.
[03:54.14]Right?
[03:54.86]Wow, that's... That is pretty fucked up.
[03:57.00]That's terrible.
[03:57.64]I know, like, where are all the other workers?
[04:01.56]Seriously, all this game has taught me is how much it sucks to work in the restaurant business.
[04:07.99]Like, I don't ever want to do this.
[04:10.19]I never want a restaurant job in my life because of how fucking awful this is.
[04:15.47]And I give two thumbs up to anybody that is doing a restaurant job right now.
[04:20.57]And if you'll excuse me for one second.
[04:30.02]Yes, I would like two large cheese pizzas, and I want them crispy on the bottom, not like last time when I didn't get them crispy.
[04:38.22]You understand?
[04:40.36]And I also want some free drinks, too.
[04:42.75]Otherwise, I'm going to complain to your boss.
[04:45.51]Dickhead.
