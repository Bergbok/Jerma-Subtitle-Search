[00:09.13]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.83]Jerma here with some trouble in Terrorist Town, the mod for Garry's Mod and Counter- Source.
[00:18.29]Just wanted to briefly introduce this before the live stuff kicks in, because it can be very confusing if you're just watching this and have no idea what's going on.
[00:25.52]So I will try to clarify this a little bit before we get started.
[00:29.46]So essentially, it's kind of in the same category as Jailbreak.
[00:33.23]where it's just this enormous social experiment, and I love stuff like this, it's one of the reasons I love Jailbreak so much.
[00:39.43]And you're gonna see a lot more Jailbreak, you'll probably see a lot of this as well, this TTT, I think that's what people call it.
[00:45.25]But so this is how it breaks down, right?
[00:46.85]You got three different people, three different types of people in this game.
[00:50.09]You have innocents, traitors, and detectives.
[00:53.12]So what you do, the whole point of the game is to just stay alive.
[00:55.94]If you're an innocent like I am in this game, the whole goal is to just not die and to try and get rid of all the traitors.
[01:02.78]The traitors, their goal is to try and kill everybody without being seen and without being found out.
[01:09.08]And the detectives, they are the exact same things as innocents, except they have a couple of things at their arsenal to try and track down the traitors.
[01:17.13]They have something, they have a DNA scanner and stuff like that.
[01:19.99]So it's cool to be either one of these things, because it really is just a giant show.
[01:24.70]It's just a giant acting lesson.
[01:26.84]If you're a traitor, or even if you're an innocent, you have to try to find ways to convince your fellow man to not kill you.
[01:35.03]So again, you have to have Counter-Strike Source and Gary's mod to be able to play this game.
[01:39.99]If you have these two, go check it out.
[01:41.72]And here comes a live session right here of just absolute nonsense.
[01:46.06]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[01:47.56]Enjoy the live commentary and take care, everybody.
[01:53.84]Dude, I'm with ass-faced and abusive.
[01:56.12]I'm with ass-faced and abusive.
[01:58.86]I'm with ass-faced and abusive.
[02:01.22]Okay, who's on the other side of that door?
[02:02.68]Dude, you can trust me.
[02:03.58]You can trust me.
[02:04.08]It's one of the detectives.
[02:05.59]Oh, oh, oh!
[02:06.65]Where is he?
[02:10.27]I'm with ass-faced and abusive.
[02:15.03]Who just shot the detective?
[02:17.85]I don't know.
[02:18.49]That was the scariest thing ever.
[02:20.96]Oh, oh, oh!
[02:22.69]Get him, get him, kill him.
[02:23.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, Broby.
[02:25.79]Kill Broby, kill Broby.
[02:26.83]I can't, there's a chair in the way.
[02:28.25]Seriously, there's a chair in the way.
[02:32.01]No, I'm sorry.
[02:32.85]Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.
[02:34.05]Get out.
[02:34.35]Get the chair out of the way.
[02:35.39]Get the chair out of the way.
[02:37.53]Oh, ass face.
[02:38.95]Broby killed the detective.
[02:40.64]I'm going to do some DNA testing.
[02:41.88]Was Broby a terrorist?
[02:43.50]Yeah, Broby was a traitor and she killed Rainbow Kitten who was a traitor.
[02:50.52]Me and Jerma opened the door.
[02:53.04]And Rainbow can't just get some stuff.
[02:54.32]That's a DNA scanner.
[02:55.08]Alright, well, let... I have DNA on you, too, if you did anything here.
[03:01.56]Yeah, I killed the detective.
[03:03.70]No, I mean the traitor.
[03:04.56]I killed the detective.
[03:06.58]Well, I mean, no, I didn't do that.
[03:07.73]No, I killed the traitor.
[03:09.75]I'm with Abusive.
[03:10.53]If I die, it's Abusive.
[03:12.47]This Renegade, why is he badly wounded?
[03:13.81]I'm with Abusive and Germa.
[03:15.23]They're locking me in.
[03:16.01]And stay in there.
[03:20.74]I picked up a DNA scanner.
[03:21.90]I can pick those up.
[03:23.40]Renegade, why are you badly wounded?
[03:24.94]Where have you been?
[03:27.22]All right.
[03:29.46]All right, Jerma, try to pick up this AWP right here.
[03:33.42]Drop your primary.
[03:34.64]This doesn't work.
[03:35.52]This doesn't work.
[03:36.28]Traders don't get it.
[03:37.12]Really?
[03:39.27]Yeah, it just doesn't work.
[03:41.25]Are you sure that doesn't work?
[03:43.13]What's going on?
[03:46.59]Oh my god, that's morbid.
[03:48.77]I think there's someone missing.
[03:49.93]Rene, why are you hurt?
[03:51.71]I already asked him.
[03:54.37]What?
[03:54.59]Explosion on the elevator.
[03:57.36]I'm alone with Renegade.
[03:59.56]I'm alone with Renegade.
[04:01.88]You're not alone with anyone.
[04:03.12]We're all here together.
[04:04.66]Same room.
[04:05.92]Alright, let's get out of here.
[04:07.44]There's gonna be C4.
[04:08.86]I'm downstairs with Renegade.
[04:11.79]We're in the bank.
[04:13.09]He's trying to get away from me.
[04:15.47]He's got his pistol out.
[04:16.41]Jeremiah, you're alone with Abusive now.
[04:18.07]He's got his M16 out.
[04:20.57]I'm alone with Abusive right now, so... We're being followed by Abusive and the man he's carrying.
[04:30.75]I'm so fucked.
[04:31.61]You guys are... There has to be a traitor here.
[04:33.94]One of these guys.
[04:34.60]I'm gonna say that probably one of us is a traitor.
[04:37.24]It's... I think it's abusive.
[04:40.04]Me too.
[04:41.58]I mean... Check him, check him, check him.
[04:43.68]Nope, he's innocent.
[04:44.52]No, damn it!
[04:46.92]Wait a... Alright, well... Where are you guys?
[04:50.28]Dude, he was carrying around that body like a real creep.
[04:56.14]Like, come on.
[05:00.89]Like it was a prize.
[05:01.89]Okay, so now it's Theo.
[05:03.77]I'll trust you guys.
[05:06.64]I do not think that Jerma is a terrorist.
[05:09.20]He wouldn't have reacted that way to a detective dying.
[05:13.23]Believe it, stealth.
[05:14.77]No, no, no, that's only when you're dead.
[05:17.08]Yeah, the people we've already looked at all the no you can only see that when you're dead like it only guys It's a real case of whodunit second floor.
[05:26.59]Oh you guys go right body here that one's Is anybody in here Already checked that they're not here.
[05:36.68]I think they're doing we have to go downstairs in the elevator.

[05:45.84]You want us to get in the elevator so bad.
[05:47.92]Let's check the business.
[05:49.90]Let's check in here quick.
[05:52.10]I would insta-die if I did that.
[05:55.65]I wouldn't even be able to arm the C4 before you guys kill me.
[05:58.05]What the hell is this?
[06:01.87]Let's get in the very confined elevator.
