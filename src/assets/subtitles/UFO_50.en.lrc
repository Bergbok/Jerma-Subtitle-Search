[ve:60.16.100]

[00:53.82]What the hell?
[00:59.24]Yeah, it's me.
[01:01.98]How are you?
[01:05.40]What's going on?
[01:11.87]Father has I'm not your father.
[01:25.68]I was playing Roblox.
[01:29.46]We can open it in a different window.
[01:33.49]Yeah, how you guys doing?
[01:35.35]I'm here.
[01:37.13]I'm not feeling great, but I'm here.
[01:43.89]I've been kind of screwed up the last.
[01:45.69]Let's call it two straight months now, which has been that's been fun.
[01:52.93]Give you a little update on that.
[01:55.11]This stream is not going to be very long.
[01:56.51]I probably... I want to try to be here for a couple hours, two or three hours.
[02:00.25]We'll see.
[02:00.55]So effective... Well, hold on.
[02:08.01]We gotta wait till people trickle in.
[02:09.24]I don't... Look, when the doors open to the movie theater...
[02:16.30]It's like the movie starts at 8 p.m.
[02:20.40]You get the previews come out and then like, you know, the don't smoke in the movie theater thing plays and the, hey, look, there's the fizzling Coke.
[02:28.00]Isn't the Coca-Cola delicious?
[02:29.20]Like, you got to give a few minutes.
[02:34.79]They don't just start playing Infinity War.
[02:36.65]Can you imagine if at exactly 8 o'clock it was just like, boom, here's the first scene?
[02:41.65]No.
[02:42.63]I have to be told that there are no cigarettes allowed in the movie theater.
[02:47.01]Just like all of you have to hear that too.
[02:54.19]Oh.
[02:54.33]Hot tamales is the grossest candy ever invented.
[03:02.00]Except for one day a year where it's the it's awesome.
[03:10.73]There is one or two days a year where I will eat one of those hot candies.
[03:16.97]And I'll go, wow, oh, amazing.
[03:21.74]This is unbelievable.
[03:23.86]And then it's disgusting for 364 days.
[03:34.42]Just for one day only.
[03:35.58]Yeah, it feels like that, doesn't it, recently?
[03:39.59]Oh, you mean, okay, I see what you're saying.
[03:41.02]Yeah, that too.
[03:43.44]What's my opinion on Burger King?
[03:45.03]Are you really want to do this right now?
[03:46.69]Are we really doing?
[03:47.51]What's my Burger King opinion?
[03:50.58]I don't even know if that's what you said.
[03:51.90]But alright, here we go.
[03:54.62]Over the last couple months, I got what I think was some type of food poisoning.
[04:02.74]This is back in... It's even... It's very hard to pinpoint this.
[04:08.08]But at some point at the end of August into September, that first week of September,
[04:15.41]Holly and I both had a stomach problem.
[04:17.92]And it was pretty much, oh, I guess maybe we just ate something that didn't agree with us.
[04:22.98]And then she got better.
[04:24.56]And then I fell off a cliff.
[04:26.98]And I don't know if my body just reacted so poorly to it or what the hell happened, but it's been crazy for the last, let's call it six and a half weeks.
[04:37.99]Uh, I'm alright.
[04:38.97]I'm fine.
[04:40.59]But still trying to figure out exactly what the hell happened and still getting over it.
[04:45.86]Because it's not just stomach problems.
[04:48.72]Like it's, it's going up to my head.
[04:50.48]I get like head pressure, headaches.
[04:54.36]It's been like, what the fuck is going on?
[04:55.89]I thought this was just like a IBD flare up.
[04:59.81]But I don't know.
[05:00.47]I could just be getting the worst.
[05:01.81]I could be in the middle of the worst flare up I've ever had in my life.
[05:05.69]So I have no idea.
[05:13.95]Somebody said worms?
[05:16.09]Trust me, I've thought about that.
[05:18.67]Do you know how many hours I've spent on WebMD seeing how many tapeworms I have?
[05:24.41]Do you know what I mean?
[05:25.05]Do you know how many times I've looked at the internet going like, hey, these are all my problems.
[05:29.49]Oh, there's probably parasites all over you.
[05:31.27]It's like, okay, let me take a step back and not think that way.
[05:37.46]Because that's a very unhealthy way to look at anything.
[05:42.52]Guys, do you know how many things have diarrhea, headaches, muscle aches, and like head pressure?
[05:51.91]There's like 7,000 illnesses.
[05:54.25]And it could be anything.
[05:56.75]Diarrhea is a symptom of like 15,000 entries on WebMD.
[06:10.44]But whatever the hell happened to me, I still don't feel good.
[06:18.88]Yeah, but you in particular have worms.
[06:24.92]All I'm saying is it's been fucking weird.
[06:26.90]Let's just put it that way.
[06:34.13]And you know, it's so annoying too, because...
[06:38.73]The last time that I was live was back in September.
[06:43.15]And at some point after that period, I was like, oh, you know, yeah, I really want to kind of get back into the sort of, you know, like at least a couple times a month, right?
[06:52.60]Like I want to stream like, you know, at least once or twice a month.
[06:56.18]Even in this slower period, whatever.
[06:57.60]I just like, I go down for the count for like two months.
[07:04.06]But it's alright.
[07:06.08]I'm here now.
[07:09.69]We're going to play, uh, I was going to play web fishing, but the last time I was live, uh, three years ago, uh, I did talk about UFO 50 and how it looked really fun.
[07:20.37]I haven't played it and I was saving it for a stream.
[07:22.23]So here we are.
[07:22.86]Is it maybe your, I'm not going to even say that.
[07:38.37]I also have to be, okay.
[07:40.19]Streaming is not a good idea for me right now because I need to keep my energy levels down because if I laugh really hard or if I cough or if I scream or something, that's why I couldn't do a Halloween stream because it's like, oh, hey, hey, what's the one thing that I shouldn't do right now is bring my blood pressure up when I have a bunch of like headaches and head pressure and like stomach problems.
[08:03.41]Let me just, let me get jump scared for four hours.
[08:06.51]Um, I want, dude, I had plans for Halloween.
[08:10.92]I am never making plans for Halloween ever again.
[08:13.60]In fact, there is a guarantee that there will never be a Halloween stream ever again.
[08:18.45]Shh, in parentheses, in parentheses.
[08:21.83]Let's just, let's call it that, right?
[08:23.73]In parentheses.
[08:25.57]Because I can't say that I'm doing it.
[08:27.31]Because every time I say I'm doing a Halloween stream, I get like sick.
[08:31.04]Wicked fucking sick.
[08:32.54]So put that in parentheses.
[08:34.86]There will never be another Halloween stream ever again.
[08:37.68]But then everything that I just said, put in parentheses.
[08:42.91]Why do you hate me?
[08:43.57]I don't hate anybody.
[08:45.73]Do your Halloween stream in February.
[08:52.54]Summer-ween, yeah.
[08:56.23]But it's been so stupid because... I was on antibiotics and it's like, oh, maybe these are working.
[09:02.89]And it's like, wait, maybe not.
[09:05.63]Maybe they did.
[09:06.69]Did they?
[09:07.07]I actually do kind of feel a little bit better.
[09:10.57]Medicine is so weird and illnesses are so bizarre.
[09:13.11]Do you need to take probiotics?
[09:20.58]I'm already on them.
[09:21.88]I'm on them right now.
[09:27.03]Probiotics, fish oil, vitamins, turmeric, turmeric tea.
[09:35.75]And any, any, any type of good nutrient.
[09:38.87]I've been just trying to drink a bunch of water.
[09:41.59]I'm there.
[09:42.19]I'm there.
[09:48.73]Try some vanilla.
[09:57.85]Have you tried DMT?
[10:00.09]I don't think that's a good idea.
[10:02.89]I don't think that's a good idea for me ever.
[10:12.61]Forgot about DMT robot.
[10:14.31]That's an old reference.
[10:15.43]That's a long time ago.
[10:17.45]Need more garlic.
[10:22.07]Ginger and cinnamon.
[10:23.42]Oh yeah, I've got ginger tea.
[10:26.36]Been drinking rooibos tea.
[10:31.62]Honestly, my pantry right now looks like an ancient medicine shop.
[10:36.56]Like, we're talking about... What were they taking 5,000 years ago?
[10:45.65]I've got, like, candles, like, incense.
[10:49.61]Different roots everywhere.
[10:50.89]Like, oh, trust me.
[10:58.14]Eye of Newt.
[10:58.80]Yeah, a witch or a warlock may as well live here.
[11:07.05]Peppermint tea.
[11:07.81]Yeah.
[11:10.97]But I'm doing okay.
[11:11.73]I'm alright.
[11:12.77]I wouldn't be here if I wasn't doing alright.
[11:14.15]So trust me, you did not want a guy that was hanging out two or three weeks ago.
[11:22.65]No.
[11:23.89]We don't have to go.
[11:24.35]We don't have to get into it.
[11:26.35]Alright.
[11:26.69]I've been just sitting here talking.
[11:27.75]Let's play.
[11:28.83]I've been looking forward to this.
[11:33.69]I've been looking forward to playing this.
[11:36.95]This, if you don't know, it is a compilation video game series where there's a bunch of video games in here.
[11:46.10]I was just puked.
[11:48.68]No, I didn't.
[11:49.50]I say that sometimes.
[11:50.56]It was a joke.
[11:51.50]Put that in parentheses.
[11:56.13]Okay, so I guess we just can we just pick any one?
[11:58.41]I have not even opened this at all, so I didn't pre-play it like I've been accused of.
[12:03.67]Should I just go start at one?
[12:09.63]Or should we start at something else?
[12:16.06]Is there a recommended one that I should start with?
[12:19.72]Do it in order.
[12:20.52]Okay.
[12:22.38]Barbuta.
[12:25.71]So this is like a fake, real fake compilation video game series.
[12:30.73]They made all of these, I think, from scratch, right?
[12:32.81]Okay, Barbuta.
[12:36.10]How I play.
[12:40.48]This is, well, this is an interactive loading screen.
[12:43.16]This is an interactive title screen.
[12:44.34]Okay, I have an attack.
[12:54.08]I just died.
[12:54.82]Okay.
[12:57.15]How does that work?
[13:02.33]Is this a troll game?
[13:03.25]Okay.
[13:14.34]Oh, I see on the left there.
[13:15.32]Yeah.
[13:16.62]Turn up the music.
[13:22.55]I mean, I don't think there is music in this one.
[13:32.00]Oh, there's a treasure chest.
[13:34.89]How did I get there?
[13:38.17]It's from 1982.
[13:38.93]I don't understand.
[13:41.61]Well, it's fake from 1982.
[13:42.73]I don't think I can get over there.
[13:54.52]I'm not going to remember any of this, by the way.
[14:03.00]I can't make this jump.
[14:11.32]I only have four more eggs, I'm screwed.
[14:19.87]Then I said, why he has dementia?
[14:23.85]No, that would mean if I had done that already and then... If I did that already and did it again.
[14:33.68]Can you drop down?
[14:34.36]There's only two buttons.
[14:39.47]Let me try the other way.
[14:48.90]You played this game last week.
[14:51.22]You were on a different stream, dude.
[14:53.22]I was fucking shitting myself a week ago.
[14:55.76]I was not here.
[15:08.69]Hey, here we go.
[15:09.43]Okay.
[15:14.35]Chat has dementia.
[15:23.99]Is this bouncy?
[15:24.47]What do you think?
[15:27.97]Can I move it?
[15:31.67]I don't think so.
[15:33.08]Oh no, Otto.
[15:33.72]I think Otto's hungry.
[15:37.15]Usually he eats around like a little bit.
[15:40.04]Can you wait like 10 minutes?
[15:43.92]He's like, no, I can't.
[15:47.56]Is there fall damage?
[15:48.28]No.
[15:48.60]I'm probably gonna have to be able to move that.
[15:50.26]Do you want your food?
[15:52.48]Alright.
[15:55.61]Pretend I didn't start the stream yet.
[15:58.07]I was thinking, should I feed him now or should I feed him after?
[16:00.05]Can I not kill these?
[16:01.99]Oh, I got it.
[16:05.67]I'm coming.
[16:06.07]I'm coming.
[16:06.39]I'm coming.
[16:06.67]Don't worry.
[16:07.79]Alright, give me one second.
[16:08.43]Let me feed him.
[16:10.82]Give me three minutes total.
[16:13.36]The stream hasn't even started yet.
[16:14.81]Just talk amongst yourselves.
[16:15.83]I'll be right back.
[23:34.85]Okay, hi, I'm back.
[23:38.21]Oh, hey guys, I'm back streaming.
[23:40.15]It's two minutes.
[23:41.05]I had a platform drop in my head and then I left.
[23:48.60]Okay.
[23:49.78]What was I doing?
[23:51.50]What was I playing?
[23:54.75]What's this game called?
[23:56.71]Super Mario?
[23:59.31]Okay, so I'm this little guy.
[24:04.78]It's been five hours?
[24:10.52]It's been five minutes.
[24:12.46]Am I dead?
[24:12.90]Okay.
[24:17.90]Can you dig?
[24:18.36]I only have three eggs left.
[24:22.90]Does that mean the game's over?
[24:29.66]This is a hard jump.
[24:30.60]This jump is hard to do.
[24:36.45]Can I kill these or no?
[24:37.35]Probably not.
[24:37.91]Maybe I can.
[24:38.29]Let's try.
[24:40.13]That was perfectly timed to die.
[24:42.45]I thought it was going to be perfectly timed to miss... You know what I was trying to do.
[24:50.28]Can you kill these things?
[24:54.97]One, two...
[25:06.10]I got it.
[25:06.44]Okay.
[25:12.39]I don't think I can make it.
[25:22.91]You have to commit.
[25:23.61]I have to commit and get it.
[25:24.35]If I don't commit, next one.
[25:29.89]I didn't make it.
[25:34.43]Oh my God.
[25:34.97]I was going to say this game is broken.
[25:37.85]Alright, so now I can either go... Can I jump all the way up here?
[25:40.23]I don't think so.
[25:44.31]I committed.
[25:44.77]Yes, I did.
[25:49.11]I'm down lower left.
[25:53.15]Oh, shit.
[25:56.58]Okay, what is this skull?
[26:01.98]They don't turn around, right?
[26:03.42]What are you talking about?
[26:07.29]I didn't jump over him?
[26:11.17]I can't lose on the first cartridge.
[26:12.59]This is the easiest one, right?
[26:14.70]I'm going down.
[26:15.18]There's a chest.
[26:26.43]Dude, you smell like hard-boiled eggs and gas.
[26:34.59]Not really.
[26:36.45]I smell like, I smell like delicate soap.
[26:43.67]I can't get over there.
[26:46.15]I'm just going to go the least dangerous route.
[26:49.91]Okay.
[26:50.23]Where's the boss?
[26:56.85]How do you get down?
[26:57.45]Is this the, I think this is the end of the game.
[27:09.54]Wait, can you hit the walls?
[27:14.06]No.
[27:16.34]I did it.
[27:16.68]I just beat the game.
[27:17.46]I made it to the end.
[27:18.12]Is it the down button?
[27:22.55]Wait, is there a... No, there's only two buttons.
[27:27.53]There's jump and attack.
[27:31.43]It takes a while to unravel this one's secrets.
[27:34.99]Okay.
[27:37.62]I technically should be able to jump up here.
[27:42.97]It's one of those games where you have to move while jumping or you can't go any momentum.
[27:46.63]Can I pop the bubble?
[27:53.76]I think I'm stuck down here forever.
[27:59.06]Is this a Metroidvania?
[28:08.61]Softlock?
[28:14.82]No, okay, I'm going to go to the room on the right.
[28:16.58]I'm still alive.
[28:17.22]I'm not dead.
[28:17.64]This is my first life.
[28:20.10]I mean, am I going to play this game again?
[28:21.26]Absolutely not.
[28:24.84]But I might.
[28:25.34]This bat is going to drive me crazy.
[28:36.32]Okay, jump over him this time.
[28:41.90]Oh shit, okay.
[28:44.84]NPC?
[28:49.88]Hello, what'll it be?
[28:51.00]Umbrella, trash, or pin?
[28:52.56]I don't have any money.
[28:53.44]What do you get?
[28:54.22]I don't... Okay, this is where you get all the stuff.
[28:57.00]Pin.
[28:58.08]Umbrella to float.
[28:59.36]Okay.
[29:01.04]I need a chest.
[29:11.29]Okay.
[29:14.64]Can you go that way?
[29:15.18]Does this one not have music?
[29:18.56]I guess it doesn't.
[29:19.22]Alright, wait for the... That was erratic.
[29:37.72]That bat is erratic.
[29:38.58]I don't like it.
[29:45.16]fuck okay that alright that one was hard that was hard really close the game yeah alright so that was egg one I'll be better at bug hunter don't worry okay bug hunter client call received begin transmission
[30:12.92]Okay.
[30:13.08]Alright, let's go.
[30:42.73]So pick up the... I gotta kill the bugs?
[30:44.13]This one's confusing.
[30:46.31]Choose an action.
[30:51.63]Shoot or a hop, run?
[30:53.17]Okay, what about just run?
[30:56.64]Run to the cube.
[30:57.26]Okay, I got a cube.
[31:00.82]Oh, they can move too.
[31:01.92]Alright, so a shoot.
[31:03.38]I can shoot down this way.
[31:05.76]Got it.
[31:07.36]Oh no, I can only attack twice.
[31:15.92]Was that stupid?
[31:22.64]Press down to buy... Oh, okay, cool.
[31:25.22]So this is how you get modules.
[31:26.28]This one's cool.
[31:29.25]Add an energy cube to any open location.
[31:31.39]Okay, so this is a resupply.
[31:32.75]Throw, blast, sprint, jump.
[31:42.39]I need more movement, right?
[31:43.88]Sprint?
[31:50.25]Can I hop over this?
[31:51.99]Oh shit, I can.
[31:56.03]Uh... Did I lose?
[32:11.12]Oh fuck, they wake up.
[32:12.38]Okay.
[32:13.72]The dragon floosh is invincible as long as it's... as long as a pet drone is nearby.
[32:20.35]Oh god, this got a lot more, this got a lot harder.
[32:22.15]Okay, um, I can run, I can shoot, I can lob.
[32:27.85]Okay, I have to kill that.
[32:34.90]And then I'm gonna run here, hop up there, grab the module.
[32:46.48]Leveled up.
[32:48.38]Row?
[32:49.76]Blast?
[32:50.36]Should I do blast?
[32:51.04]What do you think?
[32:52.26]Blast?
[32:56.04]Or should I get another movement ability?
[33:00.52]Blast him.
[33:05.81]You're creating artificial scarcity to have your view count go up.
[33:15.35]Well, like once every...
[33:17.98]What do you mean true?
[33:21.79]Artificial scarcity?
[33:28.09]You can't make me laugh right now.
[33:30.55]Shut up, because what you're saying is fucking stupid, but it's making me laugh.
[33:36.21]And I'm not supposed to laugh today.
[33:40.93]He's right, though.
[33:43.13]Let me just inform some of you.
[33:45.33]Now you got me heated.
[33:47.31]If I were to be creating artificial scarcity for myself to make my business and my career and my streaming views go up, 15,000 concurrent viewers right now?
[34:00.63]That's fucking amazing.
[34:01.69]That's incredible.
[34:03.01]I haven't streamed in almost two months.
[34:07.21]Break that down every 30 days.
[34:09.65]That's like three people a day.
[34:11.63]You understand?
[34:12.24]Like that's not artificial scarcity.
[34:21.34]Oh, that one hit a nerve.
[34:27.95]I'm doing it.
[34:28.49]Let's put it this way.
[34:29.07]I'm doing a terrible job if that's my goal.
[34:33.85]I got an idea.
[34:34.85]I just won't fucking stream for two months.
[34:37.05]Get like a bunch of viewers in one day and then never show up ever again.
[34:47.42]That's a cartoon villain plan.
[34:52.85]Whoa!
[34:56.51]That's what I... And that's why you showed up today.
[34:59.25]For my artificial scarcity stream.
[35:03.33]Big plays like that.
[35:07.01]Okay.
[35:08.99]Are these things bad?
[35:10.07]The little blue guys.
[35:19.70]Oh, shit.
[35:22.27]Oh, there's a snipe.
[35:35.33]Artificial scarcity for your bad gameplay.
[35:43.12]You guys need to shut up.
[35:46.14]Okay, do I have snipe?
[35:47.20]I do.
[35:51.31]I don't fucking know what I'm doing.
[35:54.61]Alright, up here, hop.
[35:55.35]Oh, I don't have any hops.
[35:58.89]Uh oh.
[36:01.85]Oh shit, I screwed everything up.
[36:03.75]Just pretend like you didn't see that.
[36:07.80]Okay, I got a new module.
[36:13.64]Add and edit.
[36:14.08]Okay, what's this mean?
[36:15.36]What's that mean?
[36:22.08]He's been faking diarrhea for views.
[36:24.00]You replace cubes.
[36:31.96]Ah, okay.
[36:32.60]Should I have more movement cubes?
[36:35.19]Dash.
[36:37.29]Oh, here's jump.
[36:43.39]Oh.
[36:45.41]Okay, I'm gonna do this.
[36:48.52]And then I'm gonna...
[36:52.79]Uh, is that going to help me?
[36:54.49]No.
[36:58.17]I don't usually play games like this.
[36:59.31]Uh, I fucked up.
[37:01.95]Okay, now they're eggs.
[37:16.02]Okay, the bug that... The Quasnar converts nearby energy to anti-energy.
[37:23.05]Don't let eggs hatch.
[37:24.69]Oh, I'm screwed.
[37:32.41]That didn't do anything.
[37:40.32]That was a double, right?
[37:45.84]I think I'm dead.
[37:47.80]I just checkmated myself.
[37:51.92]Can I run?
[37:52.40]Can I slide under his legs?
[37:55.71]Oh, it's anti-enter.
[37:57.01]Okay.
[37:57.65]Well, I shot.
[37:58.41]Oh, whatever.
[38:02.01]There's nothing.
[38:06.57]I like this one.
[38:08.07]But I want to watch somebody that cares about strategy.
[38:13.49]That was fun.
[38:19.40]Is he even going to beat one of these games?
[38:22.27]What the fuck just happened?
[38:23.23]I have a garden?
[38:28.19]Whoa, what?
[38:30.01]Oh, you have to beat it to get stuff for your garden.
[38:34.87]Oh, that's... Now I need to beat stuff.
[38:38.83]Okay, what about... This is called Ninper.
[38:47.84]Ninpek.
[38:50.60]Okay.
[38:50.74]Okay.
[38:53.74]I have to be good at at least one of these.
[39:02.74]I'll be good at this one.
[39:07.13]Now I'm a ghost?
[39:08.23]Alright, well I don't even know how to play!
[39:09.49]I think as long as you don't get hit more than once.
[39:15.69]Oh shit.
[39:21.74]Fuck.
[39:22.60]These are all so hard.
[39:25.40]I'm so glad that they give you the extra life.
[39:29.70]Oh, there's a double jump.
[39:30.84]Wait a minute.
[39:32.86]Okay.
[39:34.37]That changes everything.
[39:37.51]Give me, okay, start over.
[39:40.29]I'm gonna beat this one.
[39:40.91]I didn't even know there was a double jump.
[39:45.85]This game was made in like 1970.
[39:46.61]Alright, is it two?
[39:49.07]Okay, it's two hits.
[39:59.43]Now I understand what's going on.
[40:00.33]That was bullshit.
[40:11.40]Can I drop?
[40:11.78]Okay, you can drop down.
[40:17.50]You need more than two hits?
[40:18.42]Are you kidding me?
[40:20.87]Oh, God damn it.
[40:22.66]Fuck.
[40:25.38]They need three hits?
[40:26.64]Four hits?
[40:28.52]I'm doing okay.
[40:30.34]This could be going a lot worse in my second run.
[40:42.25]What's the high score? 500?
[40:53.46]Can those... I can't... Oh, that's probably... What the fuck?
[40:56.16]I thought that was a ground.
[40:57.18]I didn't realize it was water until I just looked.
[41:00.88]There's fishes coming out.
[41:01.84]Obviously, it's water.
[41:02.68]I didn't... I thought you could splash in it.
[41:17.75]I need that balloon.
[41:20.26]There we go.
[41:20.64]Nice.
[41:32.13]Oh shit.
[41:34.49]I'm going to get addicted to this.
[41:35.31]I know it.
[41:41.53]Fuck.
[41:41.95]Okay.
[41:42.33]I'm going to get addicted to this.
[41:44.97]You have to memorize.
[41:45.90]I need to get 16,000.
[41:47.42]Is that how to win?
[41:53.72]I gotta at least get up to the top five.
[41:56.28]Okay, come on.
[41:58.92]You gotta memorize how many hits it takes to kill every enemy.
[42:01.80]For instance, one, two, three, I don't even know.
[42:16.49]Just gotta focus.
[42:19.21]One, it's always two for the, uh, the pigs.
[42:28.77]These snake dinosaur things are terrible.
[42:33.63]Just like in Mega Man, if you go like really close, you can hit everything and speed it up.
[42:50.23]I've already improved way better than I did before.
[42:53.79]A couple people just smashed their hands on their desks because they're like, they're pissed that I'm doing better.
[43:04.86]Okay, there is forward momentum just pushing me, as you see.
[43:07.00]Like, I'm moving forward no matter what.
[43:11.40]So it feels kind of weird sometimes.
[43:14.06]Okay, I just was talking, and that's why I lost.
[43:17.07]Okay, I'm still... I'm mad that I was talking, and I'm mad that I was talking about talking, and I just lost.
[43:22.57]That's called going full tilt.
[43:25.39]Don't ever do that.
[43:27.47]I was angry at myself for talking and trying to play at the same time.
[43:30.93]Then I got mad at the fact that I got mad at that.
[43:33.54]And then I may be even more upset.
[43:36.14]So don't do that.
[43:39.80]If you let up a home run, just pretend like it never happened.
[43:41.58]That's the best advice.
[43:43.14]Okay, stop talking.
[43:45.77]I'm not talking.
[43:46.43]No, stop.
[43:47.09]Okay, don't get angry.
[43:47.99]Your doctor told you not to do that.
[43:52.50]Jeremy, you know, I was watching your stream the other day.
[43:54.82]You got a lot of, like, head pressure, and you have, like, this really fucking bad infection.
[43:59.01]I'm gonna need you to not freak out at fucking video games anymore, okay?
[44:08.51]You're a fucking 40-year-old man.
[44:12.03]Go mow your lawn.
[44:15.78]How long can you stay in this, like, farm for?
[44:17.68]I guess it's pretty long.
[44:19.22]Alright, this one doesn't count either.
[44:25.15]You're a grown-ass man.
[44:26.19]You can't be getting angry at video games.
[44:29.33]And I say, that's my right.
[44:32.31]That's my god-given right.
[44:33.69]To flip the fuck out at video games.
[44:37.45]Okay, I'm not gonna fuck this one up.
[44:48.02]Alright, watch this one.
[44:55.43]It's four.
[44:59.79]Oh, fuck off.
[45:12.94]What do the stars mean?
[45:14.56]Does it mean I can throw more?
[45:15.41]I think that is what that means.
[45:25.83]Oh, what the fuck?
[45:26.95]I hit him.
[45:28.91]I'm going to be here for like an hour.
[45:29.89]Okay, that is what that means.
[45:41.01]Alright, don't jump down.
[45:48.66]The fish comes up.
[45:56.31]they duck they duck and I just didn't even care or realize that till right now alright I gotta get I'm I'm so up that's a cow
[46:23.76]He's not going to beat this.
[46:24.66]Yes, I am.
[46:26.08]You're doing better than I thought.
[46:27.10]I'm going to be doing better than most of you thought.
[46:30.10]I'll get it.
[46:43.78]Oh my god, I tried to jump down.
[46:45.24]You have to like down an A and...
[47:01.21]Sometimes when you hit down an A, you jump instead.
[47:03.53]Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[47:06.42]Everyone just went, yup, yup.
[47:22.33]Yeah, I'm using D-pad.
[47:23.17]That's why you hear all the clicks.
[47:24.53]There's no way I'm doing analog with this shit.
[47:30.48]Okay, don't screw it up.
[47:31.80]I screw it up every time here.
[47:41.23]Fuck.
[47:51.73]I don't care about high score.
[47:52.63]I just care about beating the cartridge.
[47:55.76]Okay, I have not been this far.
[47:58.62]I got here low.
[47:59.28]No, I got here once.
[48:12.14]What do the snails do?
[48:20.67]Don't you dare!
[48:21.53]Oh my god!
[48:22.37]I thought I could go through the ground twice.
[48:24.37]What the fuck is that thing?
[48:28.88]I thought that was gold and I thought that was a power-up!
[48:31.92]I thought that was a power-up.
[48:32.74]It was literally gold.
[48:33.70]I'm like, oh, I'm gonna pick up the power-up bomb.
[48:39.05]Alright, I'm getting there.
[49:00.42]Oh, come on.
[49:01.34]I'm getting... You can tell I like this one.
[49:04.52]You can tell I like this one.
[49:07.41]I can't help it.
[49:08.51]You can tell I like this one.
[49:13.13]Alright.
[49:55.74]Shoot, please!
[50:04.30]Oh my god, I forgot it was two.
[50:05.94]Fuck.
[50:07.58]That was a good start.
[50:15.22]It's fundamental.
[50:16.82]It's two.
[50:17.32]You have to hit two if it's gray.
[50:35.79]Gray and green are both two shots.
[51:09.67]Okay, watch out.
[51:10.13]No bombs.
[51:10.67]Duh!
[51:13.38]Oh my god, I was so focused on that.
[51:14.78]Alright, it's falling apart.
[51:42.14]I'm fine.
[51:42.66]I thought that was the end.
[51:58.46]I played enough Donkey Kong Country to get this 100%.
[52:17.89]Oh, damn it.
[52:20.77]I need that.
[52:21.31]Give me it.
[52:23.81]Where's the lightning come from?
[52:26.66]The purple clouds?
[52:27.22]I think it's just random.
[52:29.20]Alright, where's the lightning?
[52:37.34]Light, light, light, light, light, light, light.
[52:38.54]Over there?
[52:48.33]I'm so afraid to go down and I just am.
[52:58.55]Oh shit!
[53:01.21]What?
[53:01.47]Okay, slow down, slow down.
[53:02.47]What are you doing?
[53:22.99]I don't care.
[53:25.36]What's that?
[53:30.32]Can you kill those?
[53:36.13]Oh my fucking god.
[53:37.55]It's more than one hit.
[53:45.66]Shit.
[53:46.82]That was a good one.
[53:52.18]Alright, that's probably the best I'm going to get in a while.
[53:54.62]I want to see the other games.
[53:56.72]I'll take that one.
[53:57.48]One more.
[54:12.40]Okay, we're good.
[54:16.56]That roll was bullshit.
[54:17.58]Restart.
[54:21.58]Was I almost at the end of the level?
[54:23.35]Or the game?
[54:23.81]Whatever it is.
[54:28.31]That doesn't count either.
[54:29.07]I was trying to hit down and the D-pad, if you hit, if you press down, sometimes you're pressing like every fucking D-pad button.
[54:36.05]You know what I mean?
[54:36.51]You get it.
[54:36.94]Everyone just went, I get it.
[54:46.90]I'm just trying to rush.
[54:56.39]No, go down!
[55:02.37]You do the thing that happens in Mario games where you make the jump and then you accidentally just jump again after you land on the ledge you were trying to jump to?
[55:09.82]Everyone said I get it.
[55:11.12]I saw.
[55:17.73]I'm so, I, come on.
[55:18.99]Alright, lock in.
[55:19.75]This is the last try.
[55:20.37]I lost my, last try.
[55:53.41]Alright, lock in.
[56:04.89]You fucking idiot.
[56:05.57]Let's pick the... I think it's 500 points.
[56:13.50]Okay.
[56:36.50]I was so busy trying to land that landing that like falling and hitting him that I just forgot there was no ground oh this game is too addicting I have to get away from this one I was too busy trying to like land a trick shot I'm just gonna try to focus on staying alive I don't care about points I don't care if I have fifth place
[57:22.41]No!
[57:27.57]No!
[57:56.16]What the fuck was that fish that just flew from the other side of the god darn screen?
[58:22.37]Why did you say darn?
[58:23.83]I'm trying to swear less.
[58:29.80]I'm trying to... Hold on.
[58:31.32]There's no more talking.
[58:36.46]Thank God I hit that right when I died.
[58:49.41]He's freaking me out!
[58:52.31]Oh, I knew it!
[58:53.13]I knew that... Ugh.
[59:00.64]Okay, last one, I promise.
[59:02.12]This is my final one.
[59:22.44]What the fuck?
[59:23.22]It bounced!
[59:24.94]Goodbye.
[59:27.14]I like that one a lot, but I can't do it.
[59:33.22]Paint Chase.
[59:33.88]Okay.
[59:39.79]The competitor.
[59:46.31]This is the Sesame Street NES game music.
[59:54.17]Register here.
[60:02.27]Goal, get to 50%.
[60:03.25]What the hell do you want me to do?
[60:06.51]Oh, it's one of these games.
[60:11.50]I have to paint everything?
[60:12.48]Am I winning?
[60:15.92]How do I paint that?
[60:34.83]Warning.
[60:39.20]I just killed everybody.
[60:40.02]That means I win.
[60:40.76]Alright, I get it now.
[60:47.52]I understand what's going on.
[60:53.87]So that's the spawn points.
[61:07.65]turn around okay you can't go backwards you can only go forwards
[61:21.51]I'm doing fucking terrible.
[61:23.61]Alright.
[61:25.37]Wait a second.
[61:27.65]Okay.
[61:28.87]I didn't even know that's what was going on until right now.
[61:31.25]And I still almost won.
[61:44.01]Okay.
[61:44.31]The planes are awful.
[61:53.93]There we go.
[61:56.79]Fuck this guy.
[62:01.99]Get up there, hurry!
[62:04.27]I like this one a lot.
[62:14.00]That's got to be 50%, right?
[62:17.44]Nice.
[62:18.82]This one's awesome.
[62:19.96]This one's my favorite one so far.
[62:23.33]Okay, I need 60%.
[62:35.53]That's the worst way I could have... I just did that the absolute mathematically worst way you could have done that.
[62:40.19]Pound for pound.
[62:40.93]Absolutely.
[62:41.37]Okay.
[62:53.09]Oh, shit.
[62:53.63]No, I need that open.
[62:55.75]Get away from the wall!
[62:56.79]That's definitely 60%.
[62:59.08]I got it.
[62:59.76]Nice.
[63:00.04]55%?
[63:00.06]Oh, this one's tricky.
[63:25.54]Oh, fuck this guy.
[63:26.32]He's ruining everything.
[63:27.30]There's too many of them.
[63:35.91]Shit.
[63:52.74]50%?
[63:52.76]Fuck.
[64:21.94]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[64:30.21]Don't let this guy run all the way over here.
[64:32.25]Alright, that should be it for sure.
[64:39.73]This was Splatoon in the 80s.
[64:43.23]True.
[64:45.11]Alright, this is... I'm at course number five.
[64:47.13]Okay, I see where I'm going.
[65:00.19]good I just want to control this part of the board
[65:24.01]There's too many airplanes.
[65:25.79]Is that 70?
[65:26.79]No!
[65:26.95]Oh, man.
[65:27.45]48.
[65:27.47]Alright, I'm going to do that one again.
[65:58.56]This is like a combination of Pac-Man and Splatoon.
[66:00.20]This is great.
[66:13.70]I don't fail in the first course.
[66:27.88]No!
[66:28.92]Kind of like Bomberman.
[66:33.05]Yeah.
[66:34.23]It's a bunch of different fun games.
[66:35.49]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[66:47.98]It was like the fucking remix.
[66:58.74]I was so bad at that.
[66:59.66]That was so stupid what I just did.
[67:01.02]That's like 95%.
[67:21.73]I see.
[67:21.99]The trick is to kill all the other racers.
[67:23.75]Yeah.
[67:37.75]Hey, if you just do the standard snare drum beat on anything, you make it exciting, right?
[67:44.32]I'll prove it to you.
[68:01.65]Oh my god, play the game!
[68:05.75]I think I still won, right?
[68:10.01]Okay, thank goodness.
[68:15.67]Yeah, you just have to give me a song.
[68:18.83]Give me any song that I know.
[68:25.80]Okay.
[68:26.64]I just made that like a little parade.
[68:31.44]Oh, the misery.
[68:32.56]Hold on.
[68:32.92]I got to hold that a little longer.
[68:54.89]okay hot cross buns hold on
[69:23.00]I'm ruining music for everybody here.
[69:24.44]I'm sorry.
[69:31.31]Highway to hell?
[69:33.09]How does it go?
[69:33.63]Okay.
[69:34.05]Okay.
[69:52.61]It gets hard to do when you have to do the half beats.
[69:54.31]I don't even know, Elmo's World?
[70:16.16]It always works.
[70:18.74]Johnny Cash hurt.
[70:20.84]Is it the one where it's like... Like that?
[70:43.04]If I felt a little bit better, like I said, I don't feel good at all.
[70:45.58]I could do, this could be way better.
[70:47.42]I could do this way longer.
[70:51.00]Too much head pressure.
[70:51.70]Yeah.
[70:52.42]If I felt better, this would be better.
[70:56.04]Beethoven's Fifth.
[71:11.83]You're doing this out of a wet shoe.
[71:14.30]Ow.
[71:14.72]You can't make me laugh.
[71:15.86]You can't make me laugh.
[71:16.80]You can't make me laugh.
[71:17.78]You can't make me laugh.
[71:18.96]You can't make me laugh.
[71:22.28]Okay.
[71:22.48]How about, um, the saw theme?
[71:47.72]This is just, okay, if there was a funny parade, this would be the song that would play when their float came out.
[71:55.80]This is turning any of these songs into funny parade music.
[72:14.20]The Simpsons, I can't... The Simpsons already is that beat, isn't it?
[72:17.32]It already is that.
[72:19.18]That's already what, half beats?
[72:21.34]Okay, I need to play the video game.
[72:25.04]Do the national anthem.
[72:39.21]It works for everything.
[72:58.51]That's also the version of every MIDI song I think that ever existed in the mid-2000s.
[73:05.82]I feel like I've heard that version of all these songs.
[73:08.72]Like on like the pre-internet internet.
[73:16.22]And you would be rocking out to that MIDI version.
[73:18.04]You'd be like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[73:20.14]I gotta win.
[73:25.51]I think I just lost because I was not even playing.
[73:32.33]You just gave me a headache.
[73:34.91]Sorry.
[73:37.20]You have to stop going in circles while you talk.
[73:39.76]There's no other way for me to do anything.
[73:56.54]I blew it.
[74:03.07]I haven't been killing anything.
[74:11.02]I think I got it.
[74:11.50]Yeah, I'm fine.
[74:15.78]Oh, come on.
[74:16.64]I'm sorry.
[74:17.78]I did like the MIDI version of all of your favorite songs.
[74:20.97]I'll come back to it.
[74:22.23]Fuck.
[74:40.37]That was Stone Cold Steve Austin's theme.
[75:12.09]Jurassic Park?
[75:16.38]Jurassic Park theme is... Alright, I'm getting tired.
[75:41.19]What am I fucking doing?
[75:43.65]What am I doing?
[75:45.25]Why am I doing this?
[75:53.07]Hey!
[75:55.43]What did you... He flew!
[75:57.21]That's not fair.
[75:57.79]He flew!
[75:58.45]I got enough
[76:13.56]It's either this or you have to get a real job.
[76:15.38]I'm not supposed to be laughing this much today.
[76:27.91]I'm sorry dude, you have to do the parade music bullshit or you're gonna go get a fucking real job.
[76:40.66]Oh, that's fucking so stupid.
[76:52.15]The bug doctor told you to stop laughing.
[76:54.01]I know, I'm trying not to.
[76:55.83]You guys are too fucking goofy.
[77:09.60]Why did I just close myself off?
[77:17.11]I gotta just keep control.
[77:30.77]Perfect.
[77:32.73]Perfect!
[77:37.11]Oh, yeah!
[77:46.35]I wish I had a big dick like you.
[77:51.05]Well, you know.
[77:52.35]Whatever.
[77:52.67]You can only... You can always, uh... I mean, I just read a chat message.
[78:00.66]I just read a chat message!
[78:01.46]I didn't mean to!
[78:02.10]Let me remind you, this is a mature audience stream.
[78:14.28]Nobody said that.
[78:16.54]That would be a great thing to plant.
[78:31.87]Don't go off course.
[78:33.17]I won.
[78:46.66]I almost just didn't win.
[78:47.56]Holy shit.
[78:52.91]End the stream before your career ends.
[78:57.93]I'm no longer... Hey, what do you mean career?
[79:01.51]I'm streaming just for fun.
[79:02.45]This is not a career.
[79:05.24]I'm not streaming.
[79:05.74]This is not a career.
[79:06.86]I'm just streaming for fun, hanging out. ...
[79:18.79]These slugs are kind of terrible.
[79:25.84]I gotta go down.
[79:29.02]What was the percentage on this one?
[79:30.14]I had to have got it, right?
[79:36.34]Oh, yeah.
[79:44.77]Does this mean your max power level?
[79:48.58]Uh-oh.
[79:53.12]Can I get actually killed now?
[79:55.58]Oh, this just got way hotter.
[80:06.33]Wait, does that... Can I kill the nemesis from the front?
[80:11.99]Or do I just avoid the nemesis?
[80:14.21]I don't know.
[80:17.44]So just don't let the nemesis hit me in the back.
[80:20.68]Got it.
[80:20.96]I don't want to touch that yet until I know what it is.
[80:25.10]I have no nemesis yet.
[80:38.49]What, did I just get a missile?
[80:45.27]I think I just lost.
[80:55.41]You gotta help her.
[80:56.05]Ooh.
[80:57.95]I'm almost halfway through.
[80:58.67]And then there's also like the singing version of every song.
[81:06.93]Oh boy, what'd I do?
[81:09.64]Oh my goodness, what am I doing?
[81:12.10]Oh my god, I've lost it.
[81:13.82]I've completely lost it.
[81:25.08]This is a disaster.
[81:26.86]There's so many slugs.
[81:30.83]Okay, I have to focus on getting the slugs out of here.
[81:33.21]Okay.
[81:40.07]Focus on the slugs.
[81:40.85]Okay.
[81:59.09]Shit, come on.
[82:01.13]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[82:17.17]That's gotta be it.
[82:17.63]Yeah, I got it.
[82:26.94]What size are my eye sockets?
[82:28.18]I don't know.
[82:29.58]Probably pretty big.
[82:35.17]I'm not going to let you fuck with me here.
[82:48.60]All the way up here.
[82:49.38]Give me the helper.
[82:54.92]Beautiful.
[83:01.04]No!
[83:02.18]Oh, that was such a mistake.
[83:04.67]That was a huge mistake.
[83:05.81]Look at how much momentum I just lost.
[83:13.42]I lost a ton of momentum by just turning into the fucking wall like an idiot.
[83:23.88]There we go.
[83:42.18]Much better.
[83:44.67]Fucking idiot.
[83:45.93]Sorry, I just got mad at myself.
[83:49.59]100%?
[83:49.69]Can I do it?
[83:55.51]Give me 100%!
[83:59.06]Nope.
[84:24.16]Don't you dare.
[84:24.90]Yep, there we go.
[84:31.43]Didn't even get to spawn.
[84:45.53]Is that enough?
[84:51.10]Oof.
[84:53.26]Oh!
[84:55.68]Do you like these games?
[84:57.02]This is my favorite one so far.
[84:59.32]This and the ninja one.
[85:07.08]I had to go this way.
[85:07.72]Good thing I went that way.
[85:16.75]Holy shit dude, are you kidding me?
[85:36.36]No, it's not enough.
[85:41.66]Shit.
[85:42.92]Go right.
[85:54.27]There we go.
[86:06.24]Do not explode.
[86:15.07]Do not explode.
[86:15.89]I definitely got it now.
[86:19.80]Yep.
[86:25.20]Don't get stressed out.
[86:26.18]I'm not.
[86:29.27]I'm good.
[86:43.65]Oh my god, what am I fucking doing?
[86:48.09]Good thing the time stopped for me to be an absolute moron.
[87:12.73]I don't know what the percentage was, but I hope I got it.
[87:15.13]What do you think of overnight oats?
[87:21.92]Uh... Nah.
[87:24.80]If I want oats, I'm going to make them right there and I want them.
[87:28.84]I ain't waiting a day for anything.
[87:38.74]Oh shit, that's bad.
[87:48.61]Impatient Patrick.
[87:50.51]Impatient, impatient, impatient.
[87:53.35]Okay, I missed that whole last cutscene.
[87:55.28]I think you can get them from behind.
[88:11.03]No, because I know I'll fuck it up.
[88:13.15]It'll be overnight.
[88:14.59]Oh!
[88:14.65]Uh-oh.
[88:16.25]Oh my god.
[88:18.77]Whoa, I thought you died.
[88:20.01]I thought you died, but you don't.
[88:24.13]I thought it started over.
[88:24.81]Well, this is not going to work.
[88:31.33]I would do overnight oats, and I would wake up in the morning and be like, oh, I can't wait to have my overnight oats.
[88:37.36]And then I would read one person on Reddit that said that it was rotten when they woke up, and I would be afraid to eat it.
[88:44.59]Yeah, anybody else do overnight oats and like they woke up and the kitchen smelled like rotten eggs?
[88:48.95]I'd be like, that's mine.
[88:49.93]Mine did that probably.
[88:50.79]I'm not eating it.
[88:55.81]That one was fun.
[88:56.25]I liked that one a lot.
[89:02.66]Or I would see, I don't know, I would see like a bug somewhere in the house.
[89:08.96]And I'd go, that got in the oats.
[89:11.10]That got in the oats.
[89:11.74]It had to have.
[89:13.82]Okay, when you say overnight oats, is there like, is it like simmering overnight?
[89:17.32]Is it just sitting overnight?
[89:18.30]I've never done it before.
[89:19.60]Do you just put it on the counter and let it just sit there and let it soak in for like 24 hours?
[89:22.92]You just put it in the fridge.
[89:35.45]You leave it in the bathroom.
[89:39.86]Yeah, all the natural oils in the bathroom.
[89:42.24]Really... God.
[89:44.24]Disgusting.
[89:48.27]Okay, magic garden.
[89:49.73]I like that one a lot.
[89:50.39]That one's fun.
[89:58.47]Magic garden.
[90:00.06]This is going to be probably match three.
[90:04.92]Jump and drop off.
[90:05.80]Okay.
[90:05.96]Okay.
[90:10.63]How does this work?
[90:14.82]What do I do?
[90:15.30]I don't get it.
[90:19.28]Is this like snake?
[90:35.93]How do I drop off?
[90:46.22]Did you tell me that's an enemy?
[90:47.96]On the stars.
[91:01.11]Oh, shit.
[91:01.73]Okay.
[91:02.81]Wait.
[91:04.33]Oh!
[91:04.87]Okay, I get it.
[91:05.39]This one's cool.
[91:07.61]Can you play League of Legends?
[91:12.79]Um...
[91:15.25]I'll never play that game.
[91:16.83]Ever.
[91:17.83]I just won't.
[91:18.55]I just won't do it.
[91:21.49]I have nothing against that game.
[91:23.53]I'm just never playing it.
[91:25.34]Period.
[91:27.00]I just won't.
[91:33.22]I just, like, hit myself.
[91:35.03]Did I just, like, kill myself?
[91:37.73]I'm too busy collecting.
[91:50.80]Oh fuck, that's the jump button!
[91:52.68]Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
[92:15.98]Oh, one's mad.

[92:20.06]Oh, you can't walk into the wall.
[92:28.56]Can you walk into any wall?
[92:41.49]This one's really cool.
[92:43.75]I like this one a lot.
[92:46.04]Magic potion.
[92:54.89]No!
[93:02.49]Fuck you!
[93:03.43]Right at the last second, I am angry.
[93:11.88]uh I love this one but I just can't do it I get too obsessed with collecting them all now you dare I was looking at the tail
[93:43.08]Notice that you have to collect 200 to win.
[93:45.66]Interesting.
[93:46.24]This game makes me miss the MS DOS days.
[93:59.07]True.
[94:04.83]What a golden era of gaming.
[94:16.57]Ooh, what's that one do?
[94:19.22]Two times power?
[94:23.96]Two times power!
[94:25.40]Oh, I didn't use it.
[94:36.84]I need a potion.
[94:38.88]Now.
[94:50.02]Good.
[95:00.33]Oh, watch it!
[95:12.85]What just killed me?
[95:13.65]I ran into the wall.
[95:17.15]I just walked into the wall.
[95:22.66]Shit.
[95:25.20]Oh, this one's so addicting as well.
[95:26.74]I like it.
[95:35.96]I hit the down button.
[95:36.98]There was a fucking input delay.
[95:45.42]This one's really good, but I want to see the other ones.
[95:48.83]Mortal?
[95:54.49]You got any plans to stream with Poke?
[95:56.97]There's always opportunity.

[96:16.15]A great evil has reawakened.
[96:19.07]Will you lay down your lives to defend Mortolia?

[118:01.62]What are you talking about?
[118:05.82]Blow up?

[119:01.50]Oh, no.
[119:05.78]I think I lost.

[120:15.47]I had it.
[120:15.91]I know.
[120:16.13]I was trying to time the arrow.
[120:24.73]I'm just rushing now.
[120:45.00]I blinked.
[120:45.62]I blinked my eyes hard.
[120:48.82]And that's why that happened.
[121:03.45]What are you talking about?
[121:05.23]I can't believe it.
[121:08.15]I can't.
[121:20.03]I don't even need it.
[121:20.53]Oh my fucking god.
[121:35.38]Hold on.
[121:36.22]Hey dude, you gonna have a big turkey for Thanksgiving?
[121:40.72]I don't know, maybe.

[121:55.76]The little like butterball ones.
[122:00.46]Okay.
[122:02.62]Let's chill.
[122:10.25]Can I get down there from here?
[122:12.89]Do I need to even do all that shit?
[122:19.03]So what if I just don't press this button?
[122:26.96]I have to weigh it down somehow, right?
[122:36.74]Someone just said, blow up the blocks, and I did it.
[122:39.59]And four...
[123:07.43]I could have killed it!
[123:14.27]Who gives a shit?
[123:21.20]I could have killed that too!
[123:23.48]I'm just trying to go too fast.
[123:24.79]Okay, this time, let me get this right.
[123:28.15]There we go.
[123:31.89]Perfect.
[123:37.15]Let's make it happen.
[123:37.95]Oh, sweet.
[123:53.89]I have to jump first.
[123:55.43]God, you fucking piece of shit.
[124:05.92]I thought I was going to weigh those down and break them.
[124:28.64]okay got him I could have killed it
[125:03.21]Okay, don't mess it up again.
[125:19.63]Do I have to die here?
[125:23.49]Kind of.
[125:34.05]Okay, finally I made it past this.
[126:09.86]Okay.
[126:10.63]Is there anything else I need to do here?
[126:13.09]I guess I could weigh it down and then kill him.
[126:24.79]Oh my god!
[126:28.36]I... just... didn't... do it afri- Oh, sweet... premonition.
[126:53.36]Okay, this one gave me trouble last time because I'm stupid.
[127:15.39]Alright, now he'll come on here and we'll go down, right?
[127:17.09]Uh-oh.
[127:31.98]Oh, sweet.
[127:36.42]Guys, I just can't do it.
[127:38.10]I just did.
[127:39.10]I knew I fucking did it wrong in the first move.
[127:43.01]I guess I could.
[127:43.59]Here's what I'm going to do.
[127:49.48]That's not going to work.
[127:55.72]Here's my plan.
[128:02.10]What?
[128:03.03]What the fuck are you talking about?
[128:04.27]I wanted to keep two.
[128:08.39]Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[128:14.58]I can't.
[128:16.56]Shit.
[128:17.48]What am I doing?
[128:18.46]Oh, sweet.
[128:20.91]Reminiscence.

[128:47.93]That's this one.
[128:59.94]Oh, sweet.
[129:01.30]Can I actually not do this?
[129:09.18]Bro.
[129:10.42]Bro.
[129:12.76]Do I have to blow it up now?
[129:16.93]Why can't I get... Why did I put that on the end?
[129:25.47]I do it every time to myself.
[129:30.31]I've never been here.
[129:33.45]I hope that's correct.
[129:44.19]Yes!
[129:49.39]Okay.
[130:34.79]Hey, I got one out of that.
[131:03.86]No!
[131:22.59]This is astounding.
[131:23.65]There's a lot of pressure to...
[131:28.48]I've never seen these things before.
[131:29.82]There's a lot of pressure to get it right.
[131:31.58]And I have 20.
[131:32.73]Hey.
[131:32.99]Fuck.
[131:35.89]Fuck.

[132:34.98]Oh!
[132:36.92]That's interesting.

[133:37.87]Okay, hold on.
[133:39.79]Guys, this is the first video game ever in the history of video games where tapping the button does not swim.
[133:47.81]Holding the button does.
[133:48.93]I know, Otto.
[133:49.59]See?
[133:50.05]Otto agrees.
[133:52.20]I was tapping A. You have to hold A. The first video game in human history.
[134:11.63]Well, now we know for next time, okay?
[134:13.94]Hmm.
[134:15.32]I think I just have to die.
[134:27.64]Right here.
[134:35.05]He's just hanging out over here.
[134:36.83]He's just looking at me.
[134:37.47]He's like, what are you doing?
[134:39.43]He's just like, hey.
[134:41.94]What's the matter with you, huh?
[134:44.06]What's the matter with you?
[134:44.70]Somebody's in Minecraft?
[134:56.91]No.
[135:00.38]No Minecraft.
[135:03.34]Okay, what am I doing here?
[135:04.54]I'm going... I'm going to die right here.
[135:13.47]Not by a fish.
[135:14.81]That counts.
[135:16.18]Oh, shit.
[135:21.14]Premonition... Uh-oh.
[135:25.58]Do you need Tempnato?
[135:26.30]What's wrong?
[135:29.10]I have to die right here.
[135:31.92]Oh my god.
[135:32.79]Need to go outside?
[135:41.70]It's not worth it anymore.
[135:43.31]Well, I'm going to restart this level anyways.
[135:45.55]Or I might just check out the other games.
[135:48.85]Because this is amazing and I love this one, but I want to see the other stuff.
[135:52.59]Do you need something?
[135:56.79]What do you need?
[135:57.71]Do you need something?
[135:59.55]Let me see what he needs.
[136:00.47]I'll be right back.
[136:02.98]BRB.
[136:06.68]What can I get you?
[136:07.20]Something?
[136:08.28]Yeah.
[136:08.84]Alright, let's go.
[139:46.35]Hello.
[139:47.23]Somebody just asked about Grotto Beasts.
[139:53.03]Got a pretty major Grotto Beasts stuff to go over in a little bit.
[140:00.56]It's pretty cool.
[140:07.92]You'll see.
[140:08.68]Stick around.
[140:09.34]Alright.
[140:11.64]I'm going to play for a little bit longer.
[140:13.79]I do have to be a little conscious of how my head is feeling.
[140:18.36]And my stomach.
[140:24.58]But I'm good.
[140:26.26]I want to see at least a handful more of these.
[140:28.06]This is a very good game.
[140:30.96]I am very surprised at how genuinely fun almost all of these have been.
[140:39.75]UFO 50.
[140:41.45]Good shit.
[140:46.79]Okay.
[140:48.03]So let's just, uh, I mean, I beat this one, so let's go back.
[140:53.37]That was a really good one.
[140:55.79]Let's look how many more games there are.
[140:57.33]I haven't even looked at them.
[140:58.11]Let's just keep going.
[141:00.64]Velgress.
[141:03.98]No audio.
[141:04.64]Oh, shit.
[141:05.88]Right.
[141:09.06]Okay.
[141:12.54]How does this one work?
[141:16.37]Somewhere deep in space, the pirate Alpha was captured by the demon princess, Charkas, and thrown into the deep pit known as Valgras.
[141:26.07]No one has ever returned from Valgras alive, for it is filled with many deadly traps and monsters.
[141:32.49]But thankfully, Alpha has survived the long fall and recovered her blaster.
[141:36.44]Holy sh- oh my god.
[141:42.00]Time to climb.
[141:49.57]jump double jump shoot aim gun oh it's one of these games oh my god
[142:22.52]New record!
[142:25.29]New record!
[142:28.15]How do I get through that?
[142:29.77]Oh, right, I can shoot the gun.
[142:42.02]How am I supposed to get out?
[142:42.80]It's unfair!
[142:52.38]I like this one.
[142:58.85]Oh, just one more.
[143:02.70]One more.
[143:04.88]This one's got that just one more feeling.
[143:08.98]Ah, just one more.
[143:23.06]shit can we please hear the beyond the first five seconds of the music I know I'm going too fast I'm not timed I guess I kind of am the clouds disappear I shot it what did nothing happened
[144:11.05]Okay, I think those are gonna break way faster than they actually do.
[144:24.06]Whoa!
[144:26.12]Okay, that's what that does.
[144:33.60]No!
[144:34.06]No!
[144:34.32]What is that?
[144:37.18]Somebody say it.
[144:44.47]Quick.
[144:46.11]No!
[144:47.67]No!
[145:05.46]Somebody get it?
[145:09.86]It goes, no, no, no, every time you get hit.
[145:16.04]And the music goes, no, no.
[145:31.88]That would be Captain America for the Super Nintendo.
[145:35.42]Captain America and the Avengers.
[145:44.00]It's also the game where the first boss goes, Go play it and fucking, you better come back here and go, you were right.
[145:55.43]I'm so fucking wrong.
[145:56.57]I was wrong.
[145:57.95]I repent.
[145:58.65]I repent.
[145:59.23]I repent.
[145:59.67]That's what I want to hear.
[146:10.62]Stop making up games.
[146:11.92]That game is a classic.
[146:18.07]Oh shit, I did it.
[146:18.89]That was just the first level.
[146:27.04]Oh, currency.
[146:29.74]Cool.
[146:31.00]Cool.
[146:32.94]Yeah.
[146:37.46]My bullets can get coins?
[146:44.51]Is that safe to go?
[146:45.33]I don't know.
[146:45.77]Can I touch this?
[146:50.99]You know, I'm gonna have to do that one more time, right?
[147:24.88]Did you guys ever play the Super Nintendo?
[147:32.52]I'm just paying attention to the boss.
[147:34.16]Like an idiot.
[147:34.62]Alright, three more attempts and I'm done.
[147:37.96]And I'm gonna go to the next one.
[147:55.35]Don't you, don't!
[147:56.51]That one didn't count.
[148:15.22]Oh my god.
[148:35.55]How did I not jump high enough?
[149:02.56]Dude, you got to be pixel perfect through these bricks.
[149:07.74]And I thought I had another jump.
[149:23.01]Come on, dude, give me a break.
[149:41.07]These little games are so fucking hard, but they're so addicting.
[149:43.84]I just, I can't stop doing it.
[150:12.86]They put him in the worst place.
[150:14.15]He's blocked by a bunch of bullshit.
[150:15.79]25 coins?
[150:17.67]Alright, we're good.
[150:41.63]Play Doodle Jump, you'll be amazed.
[150:42.91]I feel like I've played that before.
[150:44.99]Ooh.
[150:51.74]Lightning bullets don't destroy clouds.
[150:53.74]I think I like that.
[150:54.42]Cool.
[151:02.15]Okay.
[151:02.87]Don't screw up.
[151:10.28]Whoa, what?
[151:11.66]What?
[151:11.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, why is it turning back?
[151:13.48]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[151:15.94]I shoot it, it flips vertical, but then goes back to horizontal.
[151:19.50]I thought if I shoot it and it goes vertical, it's gonna stay vertical.
[151:23.43]Huh?
[151:27.31]I thought that was a shoot to flip, not flip it and then it comes back.
[151:33.77]It does stay vertical.
[151:34.69]What?
[151:35.85]What just fucking happened?
[151:47.46]Sorry, I'm reading chat.
[151:48.80]If you bump it, it flips it.
[151:52.26]You got hit, so it flipped.
[151:54.52]Wait, it resets?
[151:55.76]Or if I touch it?
[151:59.76]I like this one a lot.
[152:00.48]There's going to be some speedrunner who's going to beat this game in fucking 15 seconds.
[152:14.54]Oh my goodness.
[152:18.81]okay that was weird you can stop that short I didn't realize that you could do that
[152:48.42]Dude.
[152:48.78]I just like bumped into it and I used a jump already.
[152:59.99]Okay.
[153:02.95]I like this one, but I had... No, done.
[153:06.89]What's planet Zoldath?
[153:08.03]Okay.
[153:21.16]Okay.
[153:24.96]What do I do?
[153:31.70]Do you shake hands with the aliens?
[153:43.35]Alright, so what's the point of this one?
[153:48.89]Look at that.
[153:49.45]I think I have to collect the little ones.
[153:50.95]Look at those hurt.
[153:55.19]Ooh, energy cube.
[154:27.30]Energy cube.
[154:28.38]Stay on the perimeter.
[154:30.85]How do I get this thing to move?
[154:56.36]Hmm.
[154:56.86]Okay.
[154:57.84]Oh, a cube.
[154:59.58]Wait.
[155:00.12]Okay, I'm good.
[155:01.16]Guy right here?
[155:33.05]What triggers these guys to move?
[155:37.53]Uh... I don't... I don't know.
[155:50.10]Talk to those guys?
[155:50.68]They're NPCs?
[155:51.48]I don't think so. ...
[156:02.83]This game's like E.T.
[156:07.99]Picked up a metamorfer.
[156:10.01]How does that work?
[156:12.07]Oh, whoa.
[156:14.82]What does that do?
[156:39.09]Oh shit.
[156:44.45]Can I pick him up?
[156:45.01]Oops.
[156:45.45]What do we do?
[156:46.99]We're just two Furbies.
[156:47.84]What do we do?
[156:48.22]Okay, I get it.
[156:53.62]Things that are blocking the way.
[156:57.15]What the fuck?
[156:58.21]That's not what you have to do.
[157:01.41]Really?
[157:35.30]Okay.
[157:35.84]Back down?
[157:36.62]I can't get rid of you.
[157:38.98]What do I do with this thing?
[158:06.82]Colors make my eyes hurt.
[158:09.56]I think they're okay.
[158:11.92]Is it too bright?
[158:35.17]How bright is it for you?
[158:36.25]Wait, how bright is this?
[158:39.95]It's fine.
[158:42.53]But hold on a second.
[158:43.49]How bright is this?
[158:49.61]It's fine.
[158:49.97]Okay.
[158:50.93]One guy.
[158:51.27]Okay.
[158:51.63]Alright.
[158:52.39]Alright.
[158:53.59]Got it.
[158:55.29]Roger that.
[158:59.79]I got a lot of these purple things.
[159:08.89]What do I do?
[159:35.88]I thought you guys were full of shit.
[159:39.18]What?
[159:43.98]You need a translator?
[159:57.16]All I have is the- Oh, whoa.
[159:58.92]Okay, these are- New screen.
[160:02.06]Don't die, please.
[160:12.08]Alright, that one's fun.
[160:17.50]I got Zoldath.
[160:20.88]Attic?
[160:21.77]Attactics?
[160:24.73]Attactics.
[160:29.87]Units march forward automatically.
[160:34.33]You can move units up, down, and backward.
[160:38.14]Get units to opponent's castle to win.
[160:43.35]Units that defeat other units get promoted.
[160:44.83]I've played a flash game like this before.
[160:52.90]Oh, boy.
[160:53.42]Okay.
[160:53.80]This looks intricate.
[161:01.72]Grunts in columns of three take no melee damage.
[161:05.04]Interesting.
[161:06.00]I'm going to forget that in 15 seconds.
[161:07.76]Okay.
[161:09.34]Okay.
[161:12.09]Okay, we're good!
[161:16.83]It's Plants vs. Zombies, but we're just all the zombies.
[161:46.53]Keep going!
[161:48.29]Go, go, go!
[161:49.34]Did it!
[162:18.94]What prehistoric console is this?
[162:20.43]I'm glad you asked.
[162:21.95]This is called UFO 50.
[162:23.87]It's on steam.com.
[162:26.09]Steam, whatever, steam, what is it, steampowered?
[162:29.84]What's the name of the website?
[162:31.96]It's on Steam.
[162:37.50]And it is a new game.
[162:39.64]This is a bunch of fake old games that they're not real old games.
[162:46.57]They're fake old games making a fun reference to those plug-and-play consoles and the 50-in-ones, 101s that you saw back when you were just a young child.
[163:01.01]What's the distance they can shoot?
[163:04.59]Oh, that's not what I want.
[163:17.24]do
[163:48.65]I think I'm missing something here.
[163:49.87]Can they... Why are they not shooting?
[164:01.26]Do they have like a certain interval?
[164:08.52]I would imagine you want them in the back, right?
[164:26.25]They can't shoot through their own men, okay.
[164:36.23]Got it, okay.
[164:39.88]Only the unit in the front will attack, okay.
[164:43.92]They have more units?
[164:44.68]That's not fair.
[164:58.42]God, God, God!
[165:24.02]so so
[165:48.56]No, I can't cross.
[166:06.41]Oh shit.
[166:38.04]Go, go, go, go.
[166:39.66]Uh oh.
[167:08.25]Oh shit!
[167:10.32]Sorry, I got it, I got it, I'm gonna win.
[167:13.24]I got it, right here.
[167:15.42]Funny thing is, the NES would fucking explode if you tried to play some of these games on it.
[167:21.10]True.
[167:23.33]Okay, Shieldman Block Arrows.
[167:34.38]What happens when we get this close?
[168:03.30]Oh shit.
[168:36.92]They have so many more units than me!
[168:40.34]I think I lose.
[168:42.26]This is cute.
[168:43.82]This is cute.
[169:07.18]There's so much more to say though.
[169:08.46]This is cute.
[169:14.96]Devolition.
[169:24.97]We started this town with high hopes.
[169:28.72]Unaware of the evil below the surface.
[169:32.20]Now the Horde threatens our very survival.
[169:36.18]Uuuhhhmm... Uuuhhhhhh...
[170:06.55]Oh.
[170:06.99]Oh.
[170:45.05]Okay, I think I understand what the game wants.
[170:46.97]I'm just figuring out what it wants me to do right now.
[170:51.65]How many pieces do I have to place?
[171:16.55]okay okay interesting I got it so you have to make a rube goldberg machine okay it's a rube goldberg machine
[171:45.81]So do I have to hit the other guy with the... I have to hit this, right?
[171:52.04]Shit.
[172:04.65]I still have to hit this thing.
[172:06.32]Oh god.
[172:06.80]I think I fucking blew it.
[172:27.87]Zero points!
[172:47.41]this one this is cool I like this but I'm I do not play anything like this ever I just had to kill two
[173:18.75]Okay, I'll put you over here.
[173:24.75]Oh god, I don't know.
[173:56.74]It's a cool game, but I don't want to play it.
[174:02.48]Kick Club.
[174:10.83]I think I'm going to love this one.
[174:12.09]What are you going to do?
[174:15.83]You're just going to kick the ball?
[174:16.85]Oh, I have a timer.
[174:23.41]Wait.
[174:23.86]Okay, wait a minute.
[174:24.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[174:33.27]Jump, kick, head, slide.
[174:34.84]Okay.
[174:47.63]Oh, you can hit it with your head.
[174:48.71]Okay, I got it.
[174:49.47]Cool.
[174:53.07]This one's gonna be fun.
[174:54.91]Okay.
[175:09.47]Alright, now I understand what's going on.
[175:17.48]Already 9th place.
[175:18.44]You gotta get used to it.
[175:29.48]You gotta get the slides and the headbutts.
[175:31.01]Yeah, there we go.
[175:38.44]You can probably double it up too.
[175:53.98]Food.
[175:56.80]Slide in headbutts.
[175:58.70]That's the right way to do it.
[176:01.98]Give me that food.
[176:11.78]That timer's not a problem now, but it probably will be very soon.
[176:13.94]Oh, sweet.
[176:16.46]Oh, give me that.
[176:43.53]They probably despawn.
[176:57.47]The stream is sweet.
[176:58.40]I hope you get better.
[177:00.70]Yeah, it's... It's been a couple months, so... However long this takes, it's just ridiculous.
[177:08.16]It's been fucking crazy.
[177:11.59]But whatever.
[177:12.33]You gotta do what you gotta do.
[177:16.07]And I... Hold on, I'm talking.
[177:22.34]Ooh, chocolate!
[177:27.11]Oh.
[177:44.44]Here, maybe play the Frankenstein slot machine.
[177:46.74]You mean like the real Frankenstein slot machine or a... Why?
[177:52.81]I mean, yes, I have.
[178:02.44]The one where you lock in the Frankenstein heads and it's like... And like fucking electricity flies up from the screen and all over the place.
[178:11.68]It's kind of fucking crazy.
[178:14.27]I like this one.
[178:14.65]This is cute.
[178:28.08]I mean, I think the last time I played a slot machine, like an actual real slot machine, it's got to be at least, I mean, maybe four or five months, or at least three or four months.
[178:42.96]I don't know.
[178:43.58]It was like earlier this year, maybe.
[178:51.66]four to five hours at long last the mammals perished and we reclaimed the land that was once ours it was just as our high priests had prophesied long ago but as our society grew many of us forgot our roots and became more like mammals and it was not long before we too fell prey to the folly of war
[179:22.18]Hatchling.
[179:23.56]Capture four castles and hold them for two turns to win.
[179:31.34]Which ancestor will you pray to?
[179:34.58]Rexodon?
[179:36.12]Brontor?
[179:38.64]Quetzal?
[179:43.79]I think I'm a Quetzal fan.
[179:47.73]Quetzal or Brontor?
[179:59.20]I have two units.
[180:02.37]Where do you want to move from?
[180:07.57]Move all.
[180:16.03]Here.
[180:17.79]Found three workers.
[180:20.06]What trade will you make?
[180:23.39]One bone for four bean.
[180:25.99]Four bean for one... Okay, that's a worker.
[180:36.97]Your enemy expands.
[180:39.52]Oh.
[180:44.12]Trilock.
[180:48.02]Let's do trilock.
[180:51.16]I got three bones.
[180:53.97]Cannot afford to recruit anybody.
[180:56.91]Reveal an enemy location for four turns.
[180:59.73]Teleport units up to two spaces.
[181:02.19]Or kill two units of any of each type at any location.
[181:05.59]That's expensive.
[181:08.59]Uh, I don't want us to do anything.
[181:20.80]This produces beans.
[181:26.75]Okay, I want to recruit a ranged attacker.
[181:30.59]Okay, duck archer.
[181:37.31]Move here.
[181:38.82]Move them.

[181:49.04]Okay.
[181:58.71]Stegnar?
[181:59.35]Am I going to attack this?
[182:09.69]Where do you want to build?
[182:13.36]Back here?
[182:16.34]Build a... I don't know what these are.
[182:21.22]What is this?
[182:21.64]Trees?
[182:23.58]Trees?
[182:27.21]car's house.
[182:32.54]House of worship.
[182:34.88]And a military nest.
[182:35.88]Okay, stop.
[182:37.46]I'm done.
[182:50.48]You didn't read the game manual?
[182:51.78]What the fuck is this?
[182:58.62]What does that do?
[183:05.54]I want beans.
[183:13.19]Yeah, the fighting.
[183:16.21]Recruiting.
[183:20.08]Hell yeah.
[183:22.16]Recruit at which tower?
[183:24.70]This one.
[183:27.22]And I want
[183:33.35]Yeah.
[183:34.31]Time to go mess this guy up.
[183:42.03]Take everybody.
[183:43.70]And we're going to keep going.
[183:52.50]Your enemy expands.
[183:53.40]I hope you don't have more than 10 things.
[184:04.30]Who should I use here?
[184:04.98]Quetzal?
[184:12.80]Move through mountain.
[184:14.74]Yes.
[184:24.95]Uh-oh.
[184:26.91]Okay, attack time.
[184:27.79]Oh, you're dead?
[184:29.01]Hahaha.
[184:38.77]You didn't stand a chance.
[184:48.01]Go take the castle.
[184:52.27]This is why you always beef up your army in the very beginning.
[184:54.63]Any of these games.
[184:55.21]Let's get more bones.
[185:09.42]Yep.
[185:17.88]This is an owl priest?
[185:28.43]Okay, now I got my owl priest over here.
[185:35.27]That's fine.
[185:39.04]Can you please spell beans?
[185:42.72]B-E-A-N-S?
[185:44.70]What are you talking about?
[185:45.62]Is that some joke?
[185:55.29]What's the joke?
[185:56.43]Alright.
[186:06.81]Fight.
[186:08.59]Fight!
[186:10.21]Oh, you got flying units?
[186:12.77]I got arches.
[186:17.84]I'm taking all this stuff.
[186:26.58]I don't need any trades.
[186:29.43]Did he kill three people?
[186:30.43]Yeah, we need to recruit.
[186:41.68]I want more priests.
[186:47.88]I'm gonna strike lightning on their base.
[186:49.25]Okay, my priests are better.
[187:06.13]Okay.
[187:12.03]Alright, let's kill this motherfucker.
[187:15.57]What do you got?
[187:18.93]A whole lot of nothing.
[187:21.37]This would be kind of a fun hot seat game.
[187:28.56]Alright, where are you going?
[187:36.16]Are you going to try to expand?
[187:37.28]You have nothing.
[187:38.72]You have no units.
[187:45.83]I like the, uh... I like the art in this.
[187:49.91]Very fun.
[188:27.50]Okay.
[188:29.44]Let's make sure somebody's there.
[189:00.01]okay move to a mountain move mountain to a new location freeze enemy units in place I don't have enough have you ever shown your therapist your hit and run stream uh he silently watched it I was in the room and he just sat there with his he had his thumb and his forefinger on his chin
[189:26.48]And he just was quiet and he was rubbing it every now and again.
[189:30.34]He didn't write anything down.
[189:34.17]He didn't laugh either.
[189:35.47]He just sat there watching it.
[189:41.09]And I had to, and then I just paid the bill.
[189:43.07]So, I mean, I, so I, it was, it was kind of weird.
[189:53.67]He picked the pen up once, but he just kind of chewed on it.
[189:57.73]He put it in his mouth for a second, and then he put it back down.
[190:01.51]There was one point where an audible sigh came out near the end.
[190:06.13]It was pretty easy.
[190:07.55]It wasn't a big deal.
[190:08.37]It was just like a... And that was it.
[190:31.32]There's nobody here.
[190:32.08]Where are you even going?
[190:41.20]You don't even have anywhere to go.
[190:42.04]Okay, I gotta start closing in.
[190:44.50]Oh, good.
[190:45.04]Look what you did.
[191:03.68]This stinks.
[191:23.65]OK, I got to get all the castles.
[191:27.81]He's trapped up in the corner.
[191:29.23]It's over.
[191:29.57]I'm going to get my first win.
[191:49.28]Can I not select this one?
[191:50.38]Oh, okay.
[192:02.27]Yeah, I've got him.
[192:02.91]He's surrounded.
[192:12.80]Oh no, I'm under attack by your one... well actually this is... caught unaware.
[192:17.04]Oh no.
[192:21.67]The attack was repelled!
[192:39.54]You won the war!
[192:43.04]Oh, that was easy mode.
[192:48.94]Ah!
[192:49.98]Cool.
[192:53.48]Alright, I want to get through this second row, and then I'm probably gonna call it for the night.
[192:57.69]There is... Don't go anywhere, though.
[193:01.21]Stream is not over.
[193:02.17]When I get to the end of this row, stream ain't over yet.
[193:09.83]Stream ain't over yet.
[193:12.24]Mooncat.
[193:17.63]okay this is the controls are backwards or okay the directional buttons makes you move left
[193:38.59]And any of the face buttons make you go right.
[193:40.47]So you have to hold, I have to hold X to go right and go any direction on my analog to go left.
[193:46.27]It doesn't look like, oh, there's a. Okay.
[193:51.94]You can double tap.
[194:00.44]Is there a jump?
[194:12.08]What just, okay, hold on a second.
[194:17.46]How do I just do that?
[194:34.29]How do I?
[194:36.53]Okay.
[194:36.93]This is real.
[194:38.23]This is confusing.
[194:40.72]I have to double tap A or X and then hold directional to jump right.
[194:49.63]Any directional.
[194:51.09]If I want to go left and jump left, I have to double tap the D-pad any direction and then hold one of the face buttons.
[195:01.56]Okay.
[195:06.38]Oh, I actually don't have to double tap.
[195:13.08]This is weird.
[195:13.68]Whoa.
[195:20.59]Yeah, what's the ball do?
[195:31.00]Oh, I think I was a baby the whole time.
[195:41.70]Oh, I think I was supposed to die.
[195:59.94]You can't jump on things' heads.
[196:02.02]Mario figured this out a hundred years ago.
[196:15.22]Hey, I got a funny, interesting thought for you right now.
[196:19.81]Mario eventually is going to be like 200 years old.
[196:24.17]People will be talking about Mario the way that people talk about Beethoven.
[196:32.86]Eventually Mario is going to be a thousand years old.
[196:39.66]How will we remember Mario?
[196:42.84]Will he continue?
[196:46.35]Or will he turn into a Greek god?
[196:49.09]Where people think that Mario was a real guy, that we all thought was the man.
[196:55.31]Everybody loved this guy, Mario.
[196:57.27]He was super powerful, he had powers, he could jump, he threw fire out of his hands.
[197:01.58]I think Mario and Luigi and Princess Peach and shit are going to turn into Greek gods.
[197:08.30]A thousand years from now, people are going to be confused.
[197:12.65]Like Beetlejuice is going to be seen as like an old god that we used to know.
[197:19.96]Will there be a... I'm not playing the backwards fucking controls game right now.
[197:32.01]Okay, but here's the thing.
[197:33.05]What constitutes being like a Greek video game god?
[197:40.19]Like, okay, but do you think, like, Sora is gonna be there?
[197:43.81]I don't know.
[197:45.09]I don't know.
[197:46.05]I don't think so.
[197:50.25]Like, but maybe Sonic the Hedgehog?
[197:58.11]This looks awesome, by the way.
[197:59.52]Do you want all power?
[198:14.76]Kratos will.
[198:15.88]Yeah, what happens when the depictions of the gods, like, just become the gods?
[198:22.84]And Kratos actually just is the God of War, and it's the Greek, just God of War.
[198:31.35]Like, the story of Kratos becomes like, wait, the Greek gods, yeah.
[198:36.09]Kratos!
[198:37.93]Of course!
[198:39.06]I mean, you have to go back 2,000 years, but, you know, Kratos did all this stuff.
[198:49.99]Okay, I can roll and I can hold.
[198:52.56]Okay.
[198:57.86]Awesome.
[199:06.42]What's my special ability?
[199:15.48]Shit.
[199:17.62]Were you raised on McDonald's?
[199:20.96]I can't tell you very many Americans that were not raised on McDonald's, okay?
[199:33.75]Give me a break.
[199:36.01]I bet you like 40% of every American was raised on McDonald's chicken nuggets.
[199:52.97]40% of every American.
[199:58.61]I would love to see like a poll done or like a survey.
[200:03.05]Did you used to eat McDonald's frequently?
[200:05.85]I don't mean every day.
[200:06.84]I mean like frequently.
[200:08.40]I'm talking, let's see.
[200:11.56]A few times a month, maybe a couple times a month.
[200:18.04]That's like, I would say most Americans did that.
[200:21.82]Getting like a happy meal.
[200:22.89]I like chicken nuggets.
[200:23.95]Oh my God.
[200:26.67]Chicken nugget and I got a race car.
[200:40.15]Better with Burger King?
[200:40.93]No.
[200:41.95]It was always McDonald's.
[200:42.83]Always.
[200:45.03]Ronald McDonald could kick the shit out of that king.
[200:48.59]Ronald McDonald was so much cooler in every conceivable way.
[200:56.95]Ronald McDonald was like your buddy.
[200:58.09]He was like your friend.
[200:59.03]He was... Burger King is like deliberately like a weirdo, right?
[201:03.50]Ronald McDonald is the kind of guy that you bring home to mom.
[201:07.76]You know what I mean?
[201:23.87]Fresh A, you fucking idiot.
[201:28.63]You name me a food mascot that you would rather like bring home to mom than Ronald McDonald.
[201:36.18]Compassionate.
[201:37.48]Caring.
[201:38.98]Funny.
[201:41.01]Social.
[201:59.27]mom dad this is my this is my boyfriend um yeah little caesar it's just like a little guy just like where
[202:14.38]Okay, what happens when Little Caesar is Caesar?
[202:17.83]Because what we just talked about of like a thousand years goes by.
[202:20.97]People are going to think that was fucking actually Caesar.
[202:22.95]10,000 years are going to go by.
[202:25.83]They're going to be like, wow, that guy had a pizza restaurant.
[202:32.79]He did all this shit in France and then he had a pizza place.
[202:35.55]That's kind of incredible.
[202:37.65]No one's going to know what the fuck is even real in 5,000 years.
[202:39.92]Don't you guys get it?
[202:47.96]Alright, this is it.
[202:58.82]What the fuck?
[203:09.15]Do they think, do they think sports mascots are?
[203:11.55]Yeah, I'm telling you, you think it's so funny.
[203:14.85]Just wait when people think that like blue fucking thing from the Tampa Bay Rays was something we worshipped.
[203:32.19]I just got destroyed.
[203:40.44]That was a cool one.
[203:41.06]I liked it.
[203:44.76]A 15 block koala.
[203:49.21]It is something we worship.
[203:51.65]Well, if you're a Tampa Bay fan, I guess, yeah.
[203:56.39]What do we got for New England?
[203:57.23]We got, yeah, we got like the New England Patriot, right?
[204:00.25]This kind of looks like Stan Smith.
[204:04.26]Like the big, with the big chin and everything.
[204:07.20]They call it the Flying Elvis.
[204:12.42]The Quall family was excited about spending the day at the park.
[204:18.76]You betrayed New England, Vegas boy.
[204:21.00]I still- hey, what, I still can't like the Patriots?
[204:29.79]Like half of everybody here is a transplant.
[204:36.35]Oh no, the trees.
[204:42.46]Flamingos is using all the water for his... There was a small crack in the wall.
[204:50.27]Koala Kid squeezed in.
[204:51.59]They had to see what could be done to save the park.
[204:57.77]Okay.
[204:59.85]Like Mario 3?
[205:05.07]Three.
[205:18.41]Open menu and undo.
[205:19.89]What am I doing here?
[205:24.56]What am I doing here?
[205:25.46]Does this matter?
[205:30.32]Like 1, 2, 3, 4...
[205:51.40]I didn't even want to do that I'm fine
[206:20.41]I won.
[206:24.66]Push the lower numbers into the larger numbers.
[206:26.92]Oh, that makes sense.
[206:32.58]Hey, big brother.
[206:33.16]Need a break?
[206:33.90]You know I'm really good at puzzles.
[206:37.99]Oh, you character switch.
[206:39.15]Okay.
[206:42.61]I'll need five stars to open this gate.
[206:47.64]Flamingos loves puzzles.
[206:48.70]You won't get the water back that easily.
[206:50.56]Oh.
[207:28.93]My Cap'n Crunch cereal!
[207:32.19]Cap'n Crunch will be in the history books.
[207:42.81]There's going to be too much information.
[207:45.01]We're going to have to... Captain Crunch is going to have to replace Caesar in history.
[207:53.78]They'll be like, oh yeah, this guy.
[207:56.16]What is Captain Crunch's name?
[207:58.38]He's got a full name, doesn't he?
[208:02.22]What is Captain Crunch's actual full real name?
[208:06.73]Cap'n.
[208:07.27]No, it's not Cap'n Crunch.
[208:09.81]It's like... It's like... It's Horatio.
[208:12.83]Yeah, it's Horatio.
[208:14.47]Is it Horatio Crunch?
[208:21.43]Horatio Crunch.
[208:27.33]It's Cornelius.
[208:32.02]See?
[208:36.35]calm down caesar crunch shit's gonna start mixing together man I'm telling you don't just wait kids are gonna be learning about caesar on a cereal box with marshmallows in it it's all gonna mix together at some point there's gonna be 10 billion fucking pieces of data in the congress library by the way captain crunch will be in the library of congress I don't how there's no way he won't
[209:08.19]How are we gonna know?
[209:08.95]We're not gonna know.
[209:10.95]But just, we're here right now to try to put something here to say, listen everybody, Captain Crunch is not a real guy.
[209:20.21]Captain Crunch is a cartoon character that we made to sell fucking cereal.
[209:26.81]Which cereal is a thing that you eat out of a bowl with milk in it, and it was like, it was a food item.
[209:31.77]It was just a character to represent that cereal.
[209:34.62]We don't worship Captain Crunch.
[209:36.56]He's not real.
[209:37.16]He's not a real guy.
[209:38.18]I just, we need to make sure we say this.
[209:40.50]So 10,000 years from now, they'll go back and be like, oh wait, this guy said that Captain Crunch wasn't a real guy and wasn't actually like conquering people out in the, on the high seas.
[209:52.92]What is this game?
[209:59.06]Like, why will they trust you?
[210:00.78]Look, how many people are here right now?
[210:02.48]There are 14,000 people sitting here right now.
[210:05.39]Everybody in the chat is saying the same thing.
[210:07.71]I want everybody to say Captain Crunch is not a real guy.
[210:10.03]It's a cartoon character we made up.
[210:12.55]Start writing it.
[210:14.22]We made it up.
[210:15.66]We just made him up.
[210:16.38]We made him up.
[210:18.50]Caesar was a real guy.
[210:21.11]And he did the thumbs down thing.
[210:24.23]I'm sure those of you 10,000 years in the future, the thumbs down thing, Caesar came up with that.
[210:29.77]So the thing on your emoji, like your little thumbs down emoji, that was Caesar.
[210:34.64]Please go get a history book, 10,000 years in the past.
[210:37.08]They're not even going to give a shit.
[210:45.79]We're going to be like the dinosaurs to people.
[210:49.47]You ever think about that?
[210:52.07]We are going to end up as the dinosaurs.
[210:55.43]There's going to be depictions of us.
[210:57.97]Just like, well, yeah, humans, yeah.
[211:01.63]I think a meteor hit them.
[211:04.53]Who knows what the fuck happened to those people?
[211:06.23]They're going to be digging up our bones and putting together weird, like, skeleton versions of us.
[211:11.83]Our hips are going to be like where our fucking shoulders are.
[211:23.92]And they're going to cover us in, like, fucking fur and... We're not going to have eyes?
[211:30.63]What were these slots for?
[211:31.95]These two spots with these indentations?
[211:34.79]Oh, it must have been for... It probably was for, like, a mating ritual.
[211:38.66]We're not going to know what the fuck is going on.
[211:52.22]What's this thing down here?
[211:53.18]Yeah.
[211:53.74]What's this thing down here?
[211:55.70]Oh, that ancient text called that the anus.
[212:00.05]That must have been where they communicated from.
[212:02.21]There's no way it was that thing up there.
[212:04.81]No, no, there's no way.
[212:06.91]How would that ever be a thing that they would communicate out of?
[212:09.81]All the sharp edges in that spot?
[212:13.03]It had to have been for destroying food only or for fighting.
[212:18.30]They would have been cutting themselves on those teeth?
[212:20.28]No way.
[212:25.66]We're going to look wicked fucked up.
[212:27.26]We're going to look so fucked up.
[212:29.62]2,500,000 years from now, if there's aliens and shit, they're going to be making caricatures of us.
[212:34.04]And it's going to be like, holy shit, dude, you got it so wrong.
[212:36.62]We're going to have like eyes, like arms coming out of our fucking eyeballs.
[212:42.19]We're going to have like hair on our stomach, not on our head.
[212:44.55]They're going to have no idea what the fuck we look like.
[212:46.49]Okay, let's play.
[212:57.67]Oh, cute.
[212:58.15]Oh, wait, what's going on?
[213:08.20]Oh, it's a camouflage game.
[213:22.61]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[213:26.15]Somebody said, this is funny because he actually is hitting on questions historians and paleontologists do wonder about.
[213:33.73]Yeah, like, what do we know?
[213:46.72]Ooh, that's a coffee.
[213:49.16]Okay, what do we do?
[213:50.78]Float around?
[213:55.18]Rust and slash.
[213:59.16]Ah, it's one of these games.
[214:01.83]Kind of like asteroid movement.
[214:12.27]Those are points.
[214:16.22]UFO.
[214:29.76]UFO 50!
[214:33.96]Aww.
[214:37.50]That's a tight squeeze.
[214:42.11]Shit.
[214:42.91]They're gonna think we drank plastic.
[214:48.77]I've said this before.
[214:50.51]And people gave me shit for it.
[214:52.35]But... You know what?
[214:54.09]It's a what-if scenario.
[214:55.63]It's a little just thinking.
[214:57.35]We're just talking here.
[215:00.37]Do you think that like 10,000 years from now, they're gonna be like, what the hell?
[215:04.97]Why did they have a radiation device in every single home?
[215:11.05]They have a device that they press a button and radiation radiates their food.
[215:15.73]What were they fucking doing?
[215:20.29]If you really think, that's kind of strange, isn't it?
[215:25.55]I'm sure, like, cell phones is probably gonna be like... Wait, you mean that they had, like, wireless technology?
[215:30.91]There ain't no such thing!
[215:31.79]What the fuck are you talking about?
[215:32.96]We're on fuckin'... Bluta over here.
[215:37.18]Wireless technology?
[215:38.50]What do you mean, wireless?
[215:39.66]Everything has to have a wire.
[215:41.92]They're gonna be us- they're gonna be usin' Walkman.
[215:44.61]In- in other planets.
[215:46.11]And us having wireless tech- it's gonna be like, what- wait, hold it, you mean it was just going through them all day?
[215:53.93]No, why?
[215:54.59]That can't be.
[215:57.19]And they were microwaving their- they were fucking radiating their food?
[216:15.50]Aliens don't got Wi-Fi.
[216:19.97]That might be the most shocking thing to an alien.
[216:24.28]You mean I don't have to have this plugged into a USB?
[216:31.57]But how come every time I go near it I get a really huge skin rash?
[216:34.95]5 G-towers!
[216:51.98]All I'm saying is, humans, we got some weird shit, man.
[216:55.68]We have some wild shit.
[217:01.14]I am looking at a screen right now that has probably millions of teeny tiny little light bulbs that all communicate to me an image on the screen.
[217:20.68]People in the Harry Potter universe would wanna- Would we be talking about this one?
[217:25.48]When people go like, oh man, what like universe?
[217:27.60]Like the Marvel universe?
[217:28.84]Well, that's like Earth, never mind.
[217:30.62]Oh fuck, Harry Potter's Earth too.
[217:33.84]And they have like cell phones in the Harry Par- You know what I'm saying though.
[217:37.60]When people talk about like, oh man, the different universes, like what universe would you want to live in with like powers and magic and- Bro, you have a device where you can literally go take a shit and fucking telepathically communicate with people.
[217:52.49]Is that cooler than a wand?
[218:07.53]He's right.
[218:08.59]I'm glad that one of you said that.
[218:20.69]We took the things that were already magic on Earth and made them pretend magic.
[218:27.87]Like, oh man, imagine if like you could shoot fire out of your hands, dude.
[218:31.43]Like ice coming out of your hands.
[218:34.03]Just because it doesn't come out of your fucking hands, who cares?
[218:37.25]It's magic.
[218:40.29]Dude, what powers does he have?
[218:41.61]Oh, he can shoot like fire out of his mouth.
[218:44.93]We have fire.
[218:47.28]We already have it.
[218:48.48]We just like are making it.
[218:49.42]We're trying to make it more cool than it already is.
[219:06.66]What about bees?
[219:08.48]Don't get me started on fucking ants.
[219:12.21]Ants are just a gigantic math problem.
[219:14.41]A million.
[219:15.61]There are a million little variables.
[219:17.69]Ants are math.
[219:23.29]Safe zone?
[219:24.89]Whoa.
[219:27.42]Ooh.
[219:28.36]This is cool.
[219:43.98]It's like a little golf game.
[219:53.08]Bro, did you take cough syrup today?
[220:04.29]No, I didn't.
[220:10.72]I feel like this one's gonna be awesome.
[220:14.42]How can you just skip the ants are math part?
[220:16.82]I've already... People think, oh my god, he's crazy.
[220:21.06]We talked about this like seven years ago.
[220:23.83]On this very stream.
[220:24.89]In this very website.
[220:26.49]Like five years ago, at least.
[220:27.71]Okay, so I have strokes here.
[220:50.49]Jerome, most viewers were not born.
[220:58.84]Explain your theory.
[221:00.90]No, it's too much.
[221:03.32]It's too much for that.
[221:12.89]It's kind of hard to... Oh, okay.
[221:14.27]That's much easier without the analog.
[221:25.11]Hey.
[221:33.14]Shit.
[221:40.68]Do your spoons have burn marks?
[221:43.58]What do you mean?
[221:47.08]Wait, hold on.
[221:48.14]Are you implying... That looks...
[221:57.53]have burn marks I gotta calm down I have to calm down
[222:28.34]That's gotta be comment of the century.
[222:30.90]That's comment of the year, at least.
[222:34.10]Ugh.
[222:35.08]How do I... Alright, this one's cool.
[222:41.13]Ugh.
[222:43.97]Oh my god, that was a good one.
[222:46.89]I kind of didn't get it at first.
[222:48.05]I was like, hey, dude, do all your spoons have burn marks on them?
[222:50.75]And I'm like, what are you...
[222:52.86]First I'm thinking, like, what am I, like, roasting marshmallows or something?
[222:55.18]But then it's like, oh, oh, I see what you're saying.
[222:57.93]I see what you're trying to say.
[222:59.21]Oh, that was so funny.
[223:08.11]This is important.
[223:09.27]Ah.
[223:09.67]Ah.
[223:22.69]Look up what humans will look like in a thousand years if there's one specific... I don't... I don't want to know.
[223:29.55]I'm who... I'm me right now, okay?
[223:31.49]This is a racing game.
[223:33.21]And I'm in first place.
[223:46.44]I'm about to laptoed right now.
[224:08.34]I'm winning.
[224:11.10]Oh, imagine you can shoot fire out of your hands.
[224:14.22]The fact that we have fire already.
[224:15.48]You know, some of you just piss me off.
[224:18.46]The world is a fucking magical place.
[224:19.84]Are you kidding me?
[224:37.51]That's a victory right there.
[224:48.61]Streamer gets possessed by Willy Wonka on stream.
[224:57.70]I don't want any more Willy Wonka movies.
[225:10.93]Hey, the bumping should be illegal.
[225:15.88]I can't believe you're not doing the fucking Mario Kart skip.
[225:24.45]Oh, shut up.
[225:48.96]Okay, now that we're done here, let's go to the next room.
[226:17.64]Get out of the way, you dickhead!
[226:19.02]Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[226:26.26]He just... I'm still in third place.
[226:40.08]I got first last time.
[226:41.10]It's fine.
[226:41.80]You can get last and still be fine.
[226:47.26]People are just pushing me.
[227:18.74]Alright, I gotta get a distance here.
[227:20.48]Unbelievable.
[227:48.24]Thanks for the boost, stupid.
[228:04.65]Yeah!
[228:08.57]How long is your hair right now?
[228:10.22]It's about, I would say, six or seven feet.
[228:19.66]Oh, it's a figure eight.
[228:34.36]How are you ever supposed to do this?
[228:37.72]Putting up with these assholes that can swing at you.
[229:09.66]Stop!
[229:10.28]What the fuck?
[229:11.12]That guy shot me across the whole map!
[229:20.87]Finally, I get a power-up.
[229:22.33]You gonna rage quit?
[229:50.25]uh if I get last place I will I'm still in third place tied for third I guess I got a few more races to do this I gotta get like first or second here
[230:16.61]I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it, but I think it's a good idea.
[230:48.36]Get off my ass.
[230:52.92]First place.
[230:56.68]That should put me in second or third place, I don't know.
[230:59.02]Maybe even first.
[231:03.80]Ah, second.
[231:04.56]No, tied for second.
[231:05.44]Or tied, no, third place, okay.
[231:08.04]Couple more of those and I'm good. ...
[231:20.12]Another weird one.
[231:22.29]This is very simple, just don't blow it.
[231:46.12]Dude, you just fucked this whole thing up, dude.
[231:58.03]That guy is such a piece of shit.
[232:05.01]This guy's just literally driving backwards in Mario Kart right now.
[232:08.62]He's doing the thing where he knows he's going to lose, so he drives the other way and tries to crash into the people in first place.
[232:14.22]Get the fuck out of here.
[232:23.71]You dickhead.

[233:08.89]You thought I was talking shit.
[233:10.37]He's literally just sitting at the entrance.
[233:17.14]That guy is an asshole.
[233:25.87]Don't give it all up now.
[233:55.23]Smooth.
[233:56.85]That was smooth.
[233:59.47]Orange has six laps left.
[234:02.02]Yeah, because he was sitting at the entrance just waiting for people to... What an absolute piece of crap.
[234:18.09]I think I locked in first place.
[234:19.23]I just cannot come in fourth or lower.
[234:30.57]I got bumped.
[234:31.49]Sorry.
[234:57.63]Do not get out of here.
[235:21.51]Just blow by him, don't even worry about it.
[235:25.32]Alright, that's a victory right there.
[235:29.06]I just beat it.
[235:51.72]Is that the... Hey, there we go.
[235:54.82]I did it.
[235:57.26]You are the big bell race champion.
[235:59.50]See you next time.
[236:03.04]Hey, I actually beat one.
[236:08.30]What happens when you beat one?
[236:15.83]Do I get to put it in the garden?
[236:22.05]That one was good.
[236:22.57]It was a fun one.
[236:29.17]Got the gold cartridge.
[236:39.62]There's three unlocks for every game.
[236:41.20]Oh, that's cool.
[236:54.73]Alright, warp, warp tank.
[236:57.79]And then I'm gonna talk about something else.
[237:01.41]Got a lot of stuff to go over.
[237:04.10]Some exciting things to talk about.
[237:09.24]Warp tank.
[237:15.58]Oh, interesting.
[237:23.07]Rust sector?
[237:24.25]Sure.
[237:44.11]Could I be destroying all the blocks or no?
[237:53.47]Oh, interesting.
[237:58.03]What does that do?
[238:10.20]Oh, checkpoint.
[238:10.82]Okay, I get it.
[238:18.47]Oh shit!
[238:19.01]Okay, spikes.
[238:20.87]That's kind of scary.
[238:27.92]Should I do this?
[238:49.26]This feels like it's gonna close.
[238:50.38]Oh!
[238:50.64]Hit!
[239:21.10]Oh!
[239:22.66]My god, I did it again.
[239:23.86]That one's a fun one, but I'm gonna pick a random one to end it on.
[239:39.65]Uh...
[239:56.47]Grimstone?
[239:57.05]How about Rock On Island?
[240:11.80]For years, the humans and dinosaurs of Rock On Island lived in harmony.
[240:16.87]But one day, a mysterious pink UFO passed overhead and dropped a strange object onto the island.
[240:23.05]Four dinosaurs, the strongest of their tribes, found the object.
[240:27.24]When they touched it, it gave them the curse of intelligence.
[240:30.74]They decided to drive the humans away by attacking their caves.
[240:34.46]Wave 1?
[240:34.64]It's like a tower defense game?
[241:03.40]It is like a tower defense game.
[241:12.20]Wait, should I?
[241:17.76]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[241:18.50]There's multiple buttons here.
[241:26.82]Interact and confirm.
[241:31.43]What was that other menu I just had?
[241:44.90]Oh okay, grass.
[241:53.23]Let's see what they all do.
[242:22.29]He just vibes?
[242:23.07]That's it?
[242:24.27]He vibes, they're saying.
[242:25.41]He vibes.
[242:33.89]Well, shit.
[242:39.70]Rock.
[242:47.12]Alright, the chicken is... Something wrong with the chicken.
[243:06.76]Oh my god.
[243:07.70]Chicken gives food?
[243:14.97]Whoa.
[243:22.69]So now I sell it for a ton of money.
[243:29.49]What is this?
[243:30.05]What is the point of that?
[243:52.94]Fire is OP.
[244:12.45]I just said, is he stupid?
[244:15.51]Enjoy your ban.
[244:17.00]Enjoy the ban.
[244:21.20]Ban time.
[244:21.82]Enjoy the ban.
[244:22.36]Oh, ooh.
[244:35.37]Let's try that.
[244:45.42]Holy shit.
[244:46.76]Uh oh.
[244:50.43]Uh oh.
[245:01.30]That's all it takes to get banned?
[245:06.10]asking a question like that.
[245:08.02]Hey, enjoy the vacation.
[245:12.73]Let's just say, hey, enjoy the vacation.
[245:15.37]Enjoy the time off.
[245:35.27]Are you going to stream the game awards?
[245:39.57]What games did I like it this year?
[245:41.53]I feel like I haven't done a whole lot of no gaming this year.
[245:51.82]This one?
[245:52.20]This one's pretty great.
[245:56.36]Did you just get by?
[245:57.89]Come on.
[246:02.07]Stream the game awards?
[246:05.51]When are they?
[246:06.29]You can upgrade at the cave.
[246:20.87]Oh shit.
[246:28.74]Alright, I ain't stopping this.
[246:47.76]Kill it!
[246:48.80]Kill!
[246:50.11]What are you doing over there?
[246:51.41]Guy at the bottom row didn't even throw a bone.
[246:54.67]Fucking idiot.
[247:01.04]Oh.
[247:13.82]You're gonna have to get through me first.
[247:16.48]What I'm doing right now is I'm pretending these are chatters.
[247:19.70]And they're saying stupid shit and they're getting banned.
[247:23.66]Timed out.
[248:05.28]Don't dodge the question.
[248:06.34]Are you doing a Game Awards stream on December 12th?
[248:08.56]Yes or no?
[248:11.33]Yeah.
[248:12.49]Sure.
[248:15.17]That sounds fun.
[248:40.06]Sounds fun.
[248:47.43]I'm standing in the safe zone.
[248:57.63]I almost just pressed the give up button.
[249:05.72]No, I'm the last line of defense!
[249:12.08]final wave tar oh I should put tar up here
[249:49.22]I can't even.
[249:52.25]Stop him!
[249:56.29]You guys can't even stop these little toads?
[250:01.39]I'm gonna lose in the initial level.
[250:31.93]I did it.
[250:34.81]Okay, now I understand the game's a tower defense game and that's fun, but not anymore.
[250:39.06]I'm done.
[250:40.46]That was really fun.
[250:41.38]There's a ton left to do.
[250:42.32]I might just pop in and do it again at some point soon.
[250:45.87]Maybe like next week or something.
[250:47.01]I don't know.
[250:48.77]I really, if I can, I mean, I'm obviously going to try to get better here.
[250:53.11]Who knows what the hell's wrong with me?
[250:55.21]But I really want to try to do like at least a couple streams a month, a few streams a month.
[251:01.44]But that's not it.
[251:04.48]I have something to show all of you.
[251:07.96]There's quite a few things we need to talk about.
[251:09.82]A lot of you probably heard the rumors.
[251:14.50]I can just sit here for a second.
[251:19.55]A lot of you may have heard the rumors.
[251:20.88]There's a couple things we need to talk about.
[251:22.20]The first thing, very important before we talk about the second thing.
[251:26.52]The Discord.
[251:28.31]The Jerma985 official Discord is changing.
[251:33.67]It is changing.
[251:36.48]Next weekend, so in the next week here,
[251:40.58]I want to make the Discord much more manageable for me in this obviously way slower period.
[251:46.54]It's not being deleted.
[251:48.22]No.
[251:48.66]I know a lot of people here were cheering that on.
[251:51.90]Saw that earlier.
[251:54.06]No.
[251:55.20]The Discord is going to go into something called broadcast mode.
[251:59.92]And I put that in quotes.
[252:02.80]On stream days, the Discord is going to be open.
[252:07.49]On non-stream days,
[252:10.13]The 24-7 chat channels are going away.
[252:14.42]There's not going to be any more chat channels on the Discord.
[252:19.32]the recommended channel uh the rec oh my god I can't even talk the recommended channel is you know the ones that are not 24 7. uh fan art creative recommended clips those are all staying they're going to be put into a slow mode but when I do stream the Discord is going to be kind of opened up so there'll be a stream the sub stream those channels are going to stay
[252:45.22]They'll be open on stream days.
[252:48.60]And when I talk to the mods about this, we kind of, we're trying to figure out like in this period where, especially where I might, let me look at the last period here.
[252:56.36]I haven't been around in like almost two months.
[252:58.81]So trying to get these spaces where I can kind of manage them better is where I'm going to try to go with it.
[253:06.37]So, on days that there is actually a stream, it's going to be kind of at the discretion of the mods to open it before a stream.
[253:17.20]Now that can be up to like a day, potentially, before a stream.
[253:21.20]So if I'm going to go live, let's say on like a Thursday, right?
[253:25.53]Let's say Thursday at 4 o'clock is the next stream.
[253:30.23]At any point before Thursday, you know, within like a day or so, if a mod is around and they want to open it up, they can open up those chatting channels.
[253:40.97]It will stay open until the stream is over, at least a few hours after a stream.
[253:50.89]So, that's the Discord change.
[253:57.83]What if a stream gets delayed?
[253:58.95]Uh, then it'll just be open.
[254:02.03]It'll be open for a few hours.
[254:07.69]I really want to try to, like, concentrate to, like, broadcast days.
[254:13.98]Artificial scarcity.
[254:19.32]Artificial scarcity.
[254:24.04]Let me answer this too.
[254:25.56]On days where I'm going to be live more than once in a week, which will happen, I'm certain of it.
[254:31.35]Let's say I'm going to be live on like Tuesday, Wednesday, or like Tuesday, Thursday.
[254:36.23]The idea is to just kind of keep it open from like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[254:39.54]Okay.
[254:41.32]What I'm trying to do is to keep it from, you know, when I'm gone for like a week, two weeks at a time, three weeks, sometimes a month at a time, I don't really pay that much attention to Discord anyways.
[254:52.76]But having it be something that I can actually pay attention to and be able to manage it and have the mods manage it is way easier in this slower period where I'm really not paying attention at all.
[255:05.09]And I don't want to have a point where the Discord is just kind of
[255:08.37]not being really moderated or anything because like I'm not around and uh want to try to find a solution that made sense for me will the Discord be open for longer and bigger for bigger streams or projects yeah oh yeah it's just it's just not going to be like 24 7 7 days a week chatting in like a general chat or in like uh the stream chats or you know those places
[255:45.34]Yeah, it's still going to have a... absolutely still going to have a purpose.
[255:48.35]There are channels on there that are not 24-7 open kind of chat channels.
[255:53.03]That are, for instance, like Creative.
[255:55.47]Fan Art.
[255:56.63]The Recommended channel.
[255:57.51]I check... I do check Recommended a lot.
[256:00.97]The Creative channel is going to stay open.
[256:14.10]He checks it.
[256:23.60]But that leads to what about, okay, what about like your offline chat?
[256:27.16]Is the offline chat just going to stay open?
[256:30.00]Yeah, I mean, that's the idea is to kind of concentrate to the broadcasts.
[256:34.69]That's kind of where I'm going with this.
[256:41.93]If I'm only going to be live, sometimes only a couple times in a two or three month period, I'd like to concentrate it to the broadcast, like to the actual site.
[256:55.72]How many times have you seen Disco Elysium recommended?
[256:58.18]Quite a few.
[257:07.46]Can you shake it up?
[257:12.11]So offline chats, I'm not like closing it or anything.
[257:14.72]And I'm going to kind of see how this goes.
[257:19.94]Because when the Discord is open on streaming days or like, you know, a few hours before or a day before a stream or whatever, within like a day or two.
[257:27.58]I feel like it'll be it'll be much easier to manage.
[257:39.74]not being deleted it's not going away just being concentrated to broadcast days alright so what's the good news alright so here's the here here's the I would call this better news for those of you that are listening let's talk about Grotto Beasts
[258:07.50]And let me get it open first.
[258:10.51]Let me get it open first.
[258:22.95]Everybody hold on.
[258:35.65]Just delete it, bro.
[258:38.01]Why?
[258:40.36]Okay.
[258:41.78]So here's some interesting news.
[258:44.94]Remember how I talked about, like, every three months I kind of brought up, hey, you know, the Grotto Beasts tabletop simulator mod is going to get an update.
[258:52.90]Hey, Grotto Beasts is going to get an update.
[258:54.45]Hey, the Grotto Beasts tabletop simulator is going to get an update.
[258:57.47]Well, I have some good news.

[260:00.51]But it looks fucking phenomenal.
[260:03.20]Let me get it on here.
[260:05.06]So here, let me see if I got this.
[260:10.08]Okay.
[260:10.38]There it is.
[260:13.46]Can you see it?
[260:15.46]Hey, look at that.
[260:17.23]So this is the updated TTS mod.
[260:20.15]It looks a little different.
[260:22.07]It's had some graphical changes.
[260:24.37]It's had a ton of performance updates.
[260:28.22]So before where it was a little, there was people saying it was a little frame rating in some places.
[260:33.63]That has been solved.
[260:36.87]It's gorgeous.
[260:39.03]There are toys to play with now.
[260:42.43]I know a lot of people were like, wait, what do you mean toys?
[260:44.99]I'm starting with the toys because that's just the way that I want to, that's just the way I am.
[260:50.26]There's a slot machine here now, as you see.
[260:54.85]you take coins and this is mainly like for people that are playing if you're playing this is where the board is here right so if you're playing here and somebody has to go take a piss or somebody has to you know oh hey hold on I gotta let my dog out or whatever okay well I'm just gonna back away and go play with the slot machine let's play it let's do it oh let's look at the rules too okay spit I'm gonna spin it just wait

[261:30.09]Don't worry.
[261:30.41]A lot of really cool things.
[261:38.50]A lot of work went into this.
[261:41.40]This is the rules.
[261:42.00]This tells you how to play it.
[261:43.40]You already got distracted by the gambling minigame.
[261:45.40]I did.
[261:45.96]There's a bar.
[261:48.14]There's a cigar.
[261:50.28]Mr. Green's themed, you know.

[261:57.11]Or the limes.
[261:59.51]Rules on a slot machine.
[262:00.71]That's right.
[262:01.05]But hey, check it out, right?
[262:04.35]You put a coin in.
[262:06.89]And you go like this.
[262:12.86]Oh, I think I have to pick a seat.
[262:14.96]Did I not pick a seat yet?
[262:23.48]Wait, did I not put a coin in?
[262:35.11]I got a coin right here, don't I?
[262:40.28]Oh, fuck.
[262:43.80]Hey, there we go.
[262:44.52]I got it.
[262:47.64]I'm not like a tabletop simulator guy, so it had to take a second there.
[262:55.37]And you can play the slot machine.
[262:56.61]And there are different things for each thing that, you know, you can win different things.
[263:01.13]Let me try to win it once.
[263:12.03]Hey!
[263:12.59]Look out!
[263:17.21]And you get a glove and you can play with it.
[263:18.51]You can throw it around.
[263:21.73]You can't end on a loss.
[263:25.90]Let me do another one.
[263:26.56]Let's see.
[263:28.58]The Tabletop Simulator mod is free.
[263:32.60]Doesn't cost anything.
[263:33.38]It's not.
[263:34.34]It's just if you have to have Tabletop Simulator.
[263:36.69]Let me try to get the cigars.
[263:42.63]Fuck.
[263:44.91]I ran out of coins.
[263:46.37]Oh, no, I didn't.
[263:54.74]Fuck, I just bought a prize.
[263:56.62]I bought a prize from the prize machine.
[263:59.70]What'd I get?
[264:02.10]How do I open it?
[264:10.41]What'd I get?
[264:18.52]How do you flip in Tabletop Simulator?
[264:21.82]I don't know how to turn it around.
[264:29.07]It's a voucher.
[264:32.15]Oh, it's F. Hey, I got a card.
[264:35.49]Cool.
[264:36.47]Okay, so speaking of cards, if you... Hold on.
[264:39.71]I know there's all these fun little toys.
[264:41.61]What's that?
[264:42.35]I wonder.
[264:44.07]Come over here.
[264:45.35]So in the other... Before this update, this was... This is now the card directory.
[264:52.76]So you can open this up.
[264:55.76]I can get in there.
[264:57.85]this now houses all the cards all the great cards before this was laggy this now has been updated this is now perfect this thing is amazing you can get in here you can search by name by type by cost by power you can search by artist and you just simply click cards to spawn them I wonder what that thing I wonder what that thing does
[265:25.94]Yeah, there's a ton of like minor changes.
[265:30.70]A lot of polish, a lot of thought went into making.
[265:35.54]Don't look at that yet.
[265:38.28]Let's play this.
[265:39.46]This is the baseball machine.
[265:41.20]Also uses coins.
[265:44.76]Thank God I have one saved over here.
[265:48.37]So the baseball machine works like you would expect.
[265:52.91]You have outs, you have hits, you have home runs.
[265:58.29]That was a triple.
[265:58.99]See, triple, single.
[266:01.75]Yeah, you get six outs.
[266:02.99]We want people to have fun and play something.
[266:04.89]Is this UFO 50 still?
[266:06.25]I mean, I'm playing random games, but no.
[266:09.19]Let's see if I can get a home run.
[266:11.53]What if you are out of coins?
[266:14.59]That's a great question.
[266:16.91]You're going to have to make the money.
[266:18.51]You're going to have to get it from the slot machine.
[266:20.19]I don't know.
[266:23.53]I think you can just spawn coins.
[266:34.16]I want to get a home run.
[266:35.48]Oh, there's a power up.
[266:36.36]You can actually get power ups.
[266:38.64]I did not even know that this type of stuff was even possible in this mod.
[266:44.24]This is tabletop simulator.
[266:48.16]This was all made from scratch.
[266:53.36]And its only purpose is just to be like a fun little time waster.
[266:58.30]If you're playing a game.
[266:59.24]Because there's the whole card game, right?
[267:02.83]Oh, my sound's not even on.
[267:04.08]Shit.
[267:04.36]Hold on.
[267:04.54]I mean, there's supposed to be sound effects.
[267:06.64]Yeah.
[267:09.14]Let me get a home run before I strike out.
[267:16.81]Oh, there's supposed to be sound effects.
[267:22.47]No.
[267:27.74]No, I want to get a home run.
[267:40.68]Yeah, there's also the deck brewing thing.
[267:42.18]You can brew up a deck.
[267:45.12]You put three ingredients in, right?
[267:46.76]You have a fun way to create a deck.
[267:50.27]And let's talk about decks.
[267:52.71]Let's talk about the cards themselves.
[267:54.87]Because, yeah, there's a bunch of... You haven't even seen all the editions, right?
[268:00.73]A lot of little things, little interesting things that have been put in.
[268:04.85]But the designer of the game...
[268:10.19]has almost redesigned everything.
[268:13.81]If you want to play this and you want to see like a new take on it, the designer has changed a ton of the cards.
[268:22.15]The merch product that was obviously released a year ago or a year and a half ago now, that's just the way it is.
[268:30.00]The designer was like, you know what?
[268:31.14]I'm just going to do a ton of changes to it just for the TTS.
[268:34.86]So the TTS, this new update is going to have a ton of card changes.
[268:42.51]You can, and in the mod itself, correct me if I'm wrong, somebody, whoever's here, but you can switch between, like, the old versions and the new version.
[268:53.94]So you don't have to, like, oh my god, my cards, the TTS cards are all getting overwritten.
[268:58.56]The other versions exist.
[269:02.19]Somebody just said you're wrong, you don't even know.
[269:07.73]You sound different than what I remember.
[269:10.78]I'm kind of sick.
[269:12.28]I'll just say, I'll just call it that.
[269:15.40]Obviously here's the launcher.
[269:16.40]Oh, it's a coin, right?
[269:31.51]Oh, that's right.
[269:32.03]You can, you can aim with it.
[269:35.47]Those of you that are, you know, tabletop simulator enthusiasts, you'll know all the controls.
[269:40.30]Right now, I'm just clicking and dragging.
[269:42.86]How's the weather?
[269:43.42]It's been cold.
[269:45.10]But, here's the next thing.
[269:47.30]Okay?
[269:48.20]So, here's the mod.
[269:48.81]The mod looks great.
[269:49.91]New update.
[269:51.01]The update's been calling it Back to Beasts.
[269:54.97]It was supposed to be like a back to school play on things, but I have not been around in like two months.
[270:00.39]I got wicked fucking sick and I've ruined everything.
[270:03.15]So just pretend that school just started like a week ago.
[270:09.80]There's like a little jukebox here.
[270:11.09]You can play a record.
[270:12.65]We actually probably are going to try to fill this out at some point.
[270:15.71]The idea was that maybe there'd be like a bunch of music here, but just ran into not getting a ton of music for it.
[270:22.96]But there are a couple of things.
[270:25.86]I think this one here, this one from the Trivia Night.
[270:29.28]How do I use it?
[270:35.23]Can I do it?
[270:37.03]Hey!
[270:40.82]Oh, fuck.
[270:41.28]Why'd I do that?
[270:41.68]Is it on?
[270:48.66]I hear it!
[270:51.06]I think I have my volume turned really, really low.
[271:00.85]Oh, you're looking for coins?
[271:01.83]Here's some.
[271:04.39]Yeah, my volume in tabletop is turned way down.
[271:09.81]If you didn't get a chance to see this, it's actually a really pretty mod.
[271:12.99]It's way, way more ridiculous than I think a lot of people thought it was going to be.
[271:18.01]Here's your play area.
[271:19.21]You act, one of the things they added, you can actually have more than one game going at a time.
[271:23.49]So I forget how to do it, but you're showing it to me earlier.
[271:27.23]You can have more mats set up.
[271:28.95]So if you have like four or five people in the lobby, they can actually like, you can have more people play.
[271:33.98]But here is the really, really interesting thing.
[271:38.12]Saw the slot machine, we saw the baseball, there's like little toys that were added, okay.
[271:43.48]I would like for you to put your eyes over here.
[271:46.82]Because... On December 7th, the designer of the game, he floated the idea to me, he's like, you know what, I kind of want to do like a tournament.
[272:00.55]I was like, a tournament, really?
[272:01.59]Okay, that sounds kind of cool.
[272:04.14]The idea was that he was... And this just kind of goes back to the Discord stuff.
[272:09.33]There's a 24-7 Grotto Beasts chat in my Discord right now.
[272:15.52]it is no longer going to be operational.
[272:18.02]There's an announcements channel that's still going to be operational.
[272:21.04]But the designer of the game is making a Grotto Beasts Discord.
[272:26.62]And in this Grotto Beasts Discord, this is essentially I'm giving the designer sort of my blessing to kind of run a sort of official, unofficial community over there.
[272:37.39]And what he's going to do is he's going to run tournaments.
[272:39.95]He's going to run
[272:41.05]You know, it's very possible that there'll be like community expansions to the game just for the TTS.
[272:48.65]If you think that Grotto Beasts was a fun little project and you want to maybe keep active on it.
[272:53.54]I know I told the people last year that I really wanted to have this be here for the community that was active playing it.
[273:00.04]Well, now that's like actually there's a whole complete rework of a ton of the cards.
[273:06.00]And on December 7th, when this tournament happens,
[273:09.81]whoever wins first, second, and third place, you are going to have your name etched into these trophies.
[273:17.78]So this is third, second, and first.
[273:22.54]If you win first place, you're going to get your name etched on this, and it's going to be in the mod.
[273:26.32]Second place will be etched in here on the mod.
[273:28.32]Third place on the mod.
[273:30.90]And just, that's where it'll live, and that's where it'll be.
[273:37.60]Before the seventh,
[273:40.34]Now, obviously, I will announce all this stuff.
[273:44.88]And there'll be proper channels where, like, here's a link to the new Discord.
[273:47.80]Here's a link to, you know, the designer's going to run pretty much all that stuff.
[273:53.42]So you'll, don't worry, it's not going to be like, oh my god, how the fuck do I get there?
[273:56.12]How do I do this?
[274:00.66]It's a community tournament.
[274:04.46]And you can have your name etched in on the wall.
[274:09.71]Oh, just for fun.
[274:10.37]And it was part of like the kind of, I would call this like the quintessential TTS experience.
[274:20.47]And the designing of the game, the game designer said that this was like the quintessential, like he's done so many changes to the game itself.
[274:29.99]But that is it.
[274:31.56]And like I said, it is available today, tonight.
[274:36.42]It will be live in the next 24 hours.
[274:42.92]The update is out now by the looks of it.
[274:45.19]Yeah, and I think that all you need to do is just go sync into Tabletop, right?
[274:52.89]There were a few tweaks that still needed to happen.
[274:54.57]I know they were talking about it, but over the last few days, we've been kind of going back and forth about it.
[275:01.08]Yeah, there is options for the community to kind of live in this Grotto Beasts Discord that's ran by the designer.
[275:10.91]And he's just going to kind of be putting together stuff and maybe talk more about like, you know, other board games.
[275:16.62]And I guess there were a lot of people that were really into this.
[275:19.54]um for me always right like in the very beginning it was like okay like I want to do like a card merch but it kind of evolved into this like wait there's a game now there's a game on the designer made this really cool experience and I think it's a really fun thing just to have it and it can live however long it lives and the community can kind of just keep at it and keep playing with it keep having fun with it especially considering that after you know a tournament or two
[275:49.93]It's possible that there will be, like, unofficial community-like expansions, right?
[275:54.09]Like, I'm okay with that.
[275:55.35]I think that's really cool.
[276:01.04]But it should be live.
[276:03.04]The update should be live.
[276:06.56]Lots of performance improvements.
[276:09.36]Lots of card changes and additions.
[276:11.54]Definitely go poke around.
[276:13.94]There's a lot of nuance.
[276:15.30]There's a lot of little Easter eggs just hidden around.
[276:19.07]Hey, look at this.
[276:21.12]What's that?
[276:22.58]Oh.
[276:23.66]Is it a fucking firework?
[276:27.52]You didn't think cute shit like that was lying around, did you?
[276:34.21]There are a lot of just little references.
[276:35.69]It's a really wonderful, wonderful mod.
[276:39.55]And again, I got to give all the applause to the people that worked on it.
[276:47.97]Fireworks for ants.
[276:49.44]Well, they can't be huge.
[276:50.60]They'll be dangerous.
[277:02.68]Yeah, and the TTS designer, the game designer, the 3D modeler, the people that... I'm sure that they will be around.
[277:13.16]I'm sure people have a million questions.
[277:14.96]And I remember talking earlier with both the game designer and the TTS designer.
[277:19.81]And it was kind of just like, yeah, there's probably going to be a million questions on everything in that Discord when it opens.
[277:26.61]So that server is probably going to open at the end of the stream.
[277:30.51]It likely already, people have already probably found it and figured it out considering there is that on the screen that I showed.
[277:44.44]Tabletop Simulator is the name of the game.
[277:47.03]You have to have Tabletop Simulator to get in here.
[277:53.71]But lots of fun little changes.
[277:57.17]And the designer is going to do other like kind of community nights, not just like, hey, this one tournament that the designer wants to do on the 7th of December.
[278:05.49]I think the idea is just to have a little space over there where people can just play and talk and have fun.
[278:11.16]So not just for a tournament.
[278:16.39]Yeah, it regularly, this goes on sale all the time.
[278:26.05]I'm dropping shit.
[278:26.67]I'm just going to put stuff in the brewing.
[278:29.78]Let's brew up a potion.
[278:36.28]Yeah, you can just throw shit too.
[278:38.22]It's just like... I love this.
[278:45.11]Oh my god, you can throw shit.
[278:50.66]Yeah, here's like another... You can potentially... Let's say two people are playing and you just want to hang out and put your cards up over here.
[278:57.55]Maybe somebody else is playing.
[278:59.23]You can kind of spin it around and just sit.
[279:01.09]Maybe another... You can add people to the games and... All that jazz.
[279:12.64]Who hired this salesman?
[279:17.04]I did.
[279:18.48]I wanted to play the slot machine one more time.
[279:21.35]Yeah, Groutabase TTS tabletop simulator.
[279:25.31]It is available now, right now.
[279:30.71]The big update that I have been telling people was going to happen for the last, oh, let's call it six months.
[279:41.30]And it's free.
[279:42.66]And it will always be free.
[279:44.04]The tabletop mod is just a free mod.
[279:45.94]You just have to have tabletop simulator and
[279:49.37]Have fun with it.
[279:51.03]There's a ton of changes.
[279:56.19]Is there a VRChat version of this possible?
[279:59.45]Now that is a great question that I do not have an answer to.
[280:10.22]You can play TTS in VR.
[280:13.22]Oh, it has a VR mode.
[280:14.42]Okay.
[280:18.34]Very cool.
[280:21.31]Yeah, there are the two things.
[280:22.92]Some maybe news that people aren't so happy about and then some fun news like this.
[280:29.56]But yeah, to recap, Discord's going into broadcast mode.
[280:33.82]We're only on broadcast dates.
[280:35.17]It's going to be active besides channels like creative fan art, recommended clips and event stuff too, right?
[280:41.35]Let's just say for some reason that there is another big event that requires a Discord channel to be open and used and it's going to be used.
[280:50.62]The only thing that's really changing in the Discord is the removal of 24-7 chats.
[281:00.42]That's really the only major change.
[281:04.26]And you could call that a pretty major fucking change, I know.
[281:08.57]What about the art channel?
[281:10.01]Yeah, creative and fan art are staying up.
[281:13.27]Anything that doesn't need 24-7 moderation, 24-7 chatting, is going to continue to stay there.
[281:22.74]What about the fart channel?
[281:25.58]There's no reason to take that one down.
[281:27.85]If you don't know, the fart channel is a channel on Discord where once a year I just fart as loud as I can into the mic and just put the raw .wav audio into the channel and people like... You can only do emotes.
[281:39.34]So people like emote it like up or down if it was a good one or a bad one.
[281:43.14]I had a pretty great... It was 200 upvotes on the other one from like a few months ago.
[281:49.74]The one before that had like 60 so I think people were happy with the last one.
[282:01.13]So this is not going into effect immediately.
[282:03.97]We want to obviously give people a little bit of time to kind of figure out what the hell's going on.
[282:08.29]So the idea is that that next weekend, which it'll probably be the next time I stream, honestly.
[282:18.56]Yeah.
[282:18.80]So like Sunday of this coming next weekend, I'll probably be, I'm likely to be live at some point in the next like seven to 10 days.
[282:30.46]So that's when the changes will happen is effectively in the next 10 days.
[282:42.01]I hope I feel a little bit better to do more shit.
[282:45.69]I feel okay.
[282:46.95]There was a couple places on this stream where I felt a little bad, a little weird, but I think I'm alright to do like a once a week, kind of once every couple weeks kind of hangout session.
[283:00.90]I hate to say that because I know I'm going to get like hit by a fucking meteor when I like walk out the front door.
[283:09.36]But, you know.
[283:12.49]Okay.
[283:15.07]I'll see you guys soon.
[283:15.89]Again, the plan is for this coming weekend.
[283:18.31]I will probably be live again on Sunday.
[283:23.11]That's the plan.
[283:25.84]We'll see what happens.
[283:28.22]But yeah, I'll update this to us.
[283:34.76]There's probably a million questions that I hope to answer here in the coming, you know, obviously week or so.
[283:43.43]Yeah.
[283:44.53]Go play the TTS.
[283:45.75]Go join the GrottoBeast Discord.
[283:47.63]That GrottoBeast channel in the Discord effectively is like moving to a different spot.
[283:54.65]It's going to be, like I said, run by the designer of the game.
[283:57.81]Going to be all kinds of fun stuff happening over there that he's got planned.
[284:04.28]And it's a community of tabletop enthusiasts, so go talk about other shit too, like fucking Monopoly.
[284:09.93]That would get me punched in the face, I think.
[284:11.71]Saying that, like, to a tabletop enthusiast.
[284:25.15]Where's the Discord link?
[284:26.67]The Discord link will be in the GB Announcements channel on the Discord at some point in the next probably 10 to 20 minutes.
[284:39.94]Alright.
[284:40.78]See you later.
[284:41.32]See you probably next weekend.
[284:48.74]Roll the credits.
[284:51.22]Thanks for hanging out.
[284:54.45]And hopefully I can get on a more regular time here where I'm live like once every couple weeks, once a week.
[285:01.27]Trust me when I say I did not want to be not live for almost two straight months.
[285:06.46]Even if I am not really doing it that much anymore, I still wanted to.
[285:09.74]So there's still opportunity to hang out.
[285:13.36]Otto, do you need something?
[285:16.35]You've needed something a few times, haven't you?
[285:20.47]Okay, okay.
[285:26.62]He's like, hurry up.
[285:29.04]He's hurry up and give me a snack.
[285:34.87]Yeah, I'll let the credits run out.
[285:37.61]Thank you for watching.
[285:38.63]See you soon.
[285:39.35]See you next weekend.
[285:40.31]Probably on Sunday.
[285:41.53]We'll just say an exact week from now.
[285:45.68]Take care.
[285:46.12]Call your mother.
[285:49.02]See you soon.
[286:54.18]you
[287:29.06]you
