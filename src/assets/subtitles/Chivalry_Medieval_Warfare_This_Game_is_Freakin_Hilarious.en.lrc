[00:08.63]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.33]Jerma here with some Chivalry Medieval Warfare.
[00:14.69]Let me shoot this guy in the back, or just miss.
[00:18.66]This is just this blind playthrough, I just did the tutorial for one second.
[00:23.40]Oh, get it!
[00:25.12]I wonder how well I'm gonna do here, playing as the archer.
[00:27.24]Oh boy, a guy coming in.
[00:30.68]Oh, you wanna go?
[00:31.14]Oh, come on, come on, come on!
[00:34.45]Block it, block it, block it!
[00:37.59]Get out of my face!
[00:38.43]Oh, that hurts.
[00:40.01]Oh, that hurts big time.
[00:41.95]Oh, so two hits?
[00:42.93]Two hits.
[00:43.35]Okay, I get it.
[00:46.27]This game is brutal.
[00:47.19]Listen to those noises.
[00:49.85]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[00:53.05]Actually, you know what?
[00:55.31]Let's see if I can't snipe somebody.
[01:00.23]No, that was a miss.
[01:04.98]Oh!
[01:09.26]Oh, what's up with that?
[01:10.40]It makes a wicked, horrible noise.
[01:11.96]There's a lot of dudes up there.
[01:17.60]Lot of dudes up there.
[01:26.26]Just like the Huntsman in TF2.
[01:27.66]Dang!
[01:30.46]Well, did I just hurt... I thought I just hit my teammate for a second.
[01:36.30]Oh, that guy's throwing like javelins.
[01:44.80]Oh, come here, you!
[01:46.78]Oh, damn it!
[01:48.54]Oh, that guy just destroyed me.
[01:54.43]Oh, you know, I'm gonna fillet... I'll do one more life as an archer.
[01:57.21]One more life as an archer.
[02:00.05]God, this game is fun.
[02:03.15]Yeah, like I said, I just finished the tutorial, like, two seconds ago.
[02:06.85]Coming in blind, baby!
[02:07.93]I know, don't I have, like, some kind of move or something?
[02:10.91]I know I have that in this...
[02:13.65]Okay, let's wrap around this time.
[02:14.95]I'm not going to stay here.
[02:15.55]We're going to go over here.
[02:17.29]Whoa!
[02:18.97]Siege weapons.
[02:21.38]I see dead bodies.
[02:22.34]This is not good.
[02:23.88]Oh, fight going on right here.
[02:25.66]Wait, is this guy... Wait, is this guy on our team?
[02:29.06]No, he's not.
[02:30.76]Oh, God!
[02:31.54]Oh, God!
[02:33.38]They're on the stairs.
[02:35.80]Oh, you got him.
[02:36.22]You got him, bro.
[02:37.30]Don't worry.
[02:37.72]Archer backup.
[02:38.64]Archer backup.
[02:39.24]I don't want to hit you.
[02:41.02]Oh, I almost hit that guy in the back.
[02:45.10]Get out of my face!
[02:49.61]Let's go, let's go.
[02:54.47]Fighting in this stairway is the worst!
[02:57.73]Come on, follow me up here.
[03:00.19]Oh, God!
[03:02.77]Every time we were swinging, we would be hitting the sides of the wall.
[03:05.89]Alright, I'm going to go as... How do you change class?
[03:11.22]Let's go as the knight.
[03:14.79]Warhammer?
[03:16.43]Oh, hell yeah, Warhammer.
[03:19.15]I want the tower shield.
[03:21.62]Let's take the little broadsword.
[03:23.30]Let's do it.
[03:25.02]I'm gonna start smashing people now.
[03:26.72]Oh, here we go, baby.
[03:30.32]God, I'm a slug.
[03:31.80]I'm so slow.
[03:35.12]Nobody, like, behind me, right?
[03:37.06]Good.
[03:39.32]Alright, let's go for some, like, kills in a row here.
[03:43.27]Get this guy.
[03:44.07]This guy's just slugging everybody.
[03:46.73]Come on.
[03:49.99]Come on.
[03:50.71]Break his morale.
[03:52.07]Yeah.
[03:54.41]I'll smash you.
[03:56.58]Oh, this is the ultimate game for, like, smashing.
[04:00.48]Damn it.
[04:04.40]Oh, that guy just came from behind.
[04:07.74]That guy just crushed that guy.
[04:09.06]Oh my god.
[04:09.58]Alright, I think we're winning.
[04:12.68]Oh, everybody just gets stuck on the stairs.
[04:18.46]What is happening?
[04:20.93]Oh my god.
[04:22.21]What?
[04:22.89]What?
[04:23.77]Oh, some son of a bitch behind me just killed me.
[04:26.83]One of my teammates.
[04:29.87]Alright, so... So, number one thing you gotta remember about this game is friendly fire.
[04:35.71]You don't just, like, swing around in a circle when your teammates are all around.
[04:39.63]Alright, duly noted.
[04:43.76]Let's get back in here.
[04:44.58]That guy just fell off!
[04:46.75]That guy legitimately just fell to his death.
[04:49.59]Poor guy.
[04:51.43]Alright.
[04:52.17]Form a line, ranks men!
[04:53.83]Oh boy.
[04:54.71]Oh boy.
[04:56.21]This guy's toast.
[04:57.67]Oh, hey, you want me to... Oh, there's a lot of people.
[04:59.18]Never mind.
[04:59.52]Never mind.
[05:03.12]Go for the jab.
[05:03.62]Alright, coming in.
[05:04.18]Coming in hot.
[05:04.68]Coming in hot.
[05:05.32]Coming in hot!
[05:06.48]I missed!
[05:07.22]Damn it!
[05:09.59]Oh, be careful.
[05:10.19]Don't kill each other.
[05:12.12]Whoa.
[05:15.28]This is ridiculous.
[05:16.24]This is terrifying.
[05:17.10]I don't even want to go down here.
[05:24.04]Did I kill him?
[05:27.39]I got him.
[05:27.77]I'm so scared.
[05:33.79]Give me a little jab.
[05:34.83]Yeah.
[05:35.23]Uh-oh.
[05:36.63]Oh, come on.
[05:37.69]I want to kick somebody in the face.
[05:39.71]This guy right here.
[05:40.15]This guy.
[05:40.57]I'm smashing this guy.
[05:43.71]Oh, what?
[05:44.37]What?
[05:44.53]That thing's got a ton of reach.
[05:52.92]Oh, God.
[05:53.26]Oh, I get hit by a bow and arrow.
[05:55.60]That hit me right in my face.
[05:58.04]Holy crap.
[06:00.26]This is insane.
[06:03.77]Oh, yeah.
[06:04.53]One more time as a knight, and I'm going to switch to something else.
[06:07.59]I'm gonna try Vanguard next.
[06:09.05]That seems like a lot of fun.
[06:12.01]Is it like an objective we're supposed to be doing?
[06:13.87]I feel like we're just all running in and clubbing each other.
[06:15.90]Like, what's the objective here?
[06:17.26]Alright, one-on-one.
[06:19.74]You wanna go?
[06:20.64]You wanna go?
[06:21.10]I'll kick you!
[06:21.94]Oh no, I don't have kick.
[06:24.50]Oh, you wanna fake me out?
[06:25.46]I remember that from the training!
[06:29.55]Overhead smash!
[06:31.17]What, I didn't block that?! !
[06:35.66]Come here, you!
[06:37.10]Oh yeah, get it!
[06:38.25]Oh yeah!
[06:40.23]Anybody else?
[06:40.59]There's an archer up here.
[06:41.79]Oh, he's gonna shoot me in the face!
[06:45.25]Oh god, this guy's a bro!
[06:46.99]Whoa!
[06:47.51]Oh!
[06:48.53]No, don't do it!
[06:49.31]Don't hit me!
[06:51.49]Oh god!
[06:54.07]What?
[06:54.98]What?
[06:55.38]What?
[06:55.70]What?
[06:56.06]I had the shield up!
[06:56.88]Alright, let's go, uh... What do I wanna do?
[07:01.52]Vanguard?
[07:01.96]Vanguard.
[07:03.90]We're doing the spear.
[07:06.35]And throwing axe.
[07:07.85]And the war axe.
[07:11.25]And when am I spawning?
[07:12.01]When am I spawning?
[07:12.57]Did we lose?
[07:13.07]What's going on?
[07:13.62]Do we have no more recruits left?
[07:15.38]Oh, no, we do.
[07:17.24]Alright, what is the mission here?
[07:18.84]I don't even know what the hell is going on.
[07:22.48]Throwing knife?
[07:22.96]Can I just whip this?
[07:25.49]Oh, crap, I'm sorry.
[07:28.19]I just hit that guy in the back.
[07:29.73]I'm sorry.
[07:31.25]I'm whipping this.
[07:32.23]I'm hitting this guy right in his forehead.
[07:33.85]You ready?
[07:34.21]Watch this.
[07:39.78]Who is getting this in the face?
[07:43.68]Well, that didn't work.
[07:46.52]Alright, don't worry.
[07:47.04]We got this.
[07:47.44]We got this.
[07:48.22]Me and you, baby.
[07:51.38]I'll stab you.
[07:52.84]I'll stab you.
[07:54.48]Oh, I'll get you.
[07:56.02]Oh, no!
[07:58.46]Oh, this guy's freaking me out.
[08:01.83]No!
[08:06.41]I gotta get the... See, you can, like, fake people out and stuff.
[08:08.87]I gotta get the fake... I gotta get the fake out down.
[08:12.91]It's all about, like, going like this.
[08:13.87]I'm gonna hit you.
[08:14.33]Oh!
[08:14.61]I'm gonna hit you.
[08:15.10]Oh!
[08:19.12]Abandoned the castle.
[08:20.24]Wow, arrow just went by my face.
[08:23.94]I don't want to get in the face of an arrow.
[08:25.34]That's like number one thing I don't want to have happen.
[08:29.18]Alright, 1v1 me.
[08:29.94]Let's go.
[08:30.32]Let's do it again.
[08:31.96]Wow, a lot of dudes.
[08:32.72]A lot of dudes.
[08:33.26]A lot of dudes.
[08:33.70]Don't want to go up there.
[08:36.05]I'll wait for him to come.
[08:36.95]Come on.
[08:38.57]Who wants to get overhead smashed?
[08:41.53]This guy's going to jump over and just do a massive bomb swing.
[08:44.93]I can tell you right now that's what's going to happen.
[08:48.54]Here we are.
[08:50.77]Oh, what the hell?
[08:51.71]What the hell just hit me?
[08:54.51]Get him!
[08:58.81]Oh, god!
[09:01.87]Damn him!
[09:02.35]Oh my god!
[09:12.33]There's two!
[09:12.73]There's too many!
[09:13.57]It's not fair!
[09:15.37]Get me out of here!
[09:16.99]Oh god!
[09:18.05]Oh god!
[09:19.72]Oh goodness!
[09:20.64]Nice!
[09:21.18]Nice job!
[09:22.76]This game... This game is just total chaos, I love it!
[09:26.60]I love this game!
[09:27.28]Alright, get him!
[09:29.90]Get him!
[09:30.14]Bum rush him!
[09:30.96]What?!
[09:32.08]Oh, somebody hit me in the back and hit from behind!
[09:35.85]How do you win a game?
[09:36.81]I have no idea how to win a game!
[09:42.37]Uh, let's see.
[09:45.13]140 to 141.
[09:46.39]Next objective.
[09:49.27]Defend the treachery box, apparently.
[09:51.07]Alright.
[09:53.11]Wow, I went by my face.
[09:54.27]My face, my face, my face.
[09:58.29]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[09:59.36]I keep running myself into death.
[10:02.98]Oh, just like this.
[10:04.34]Oh, you want to guard?
[10:04.94]Is that what you want to do?
[10:06.60]Why don't you come up these stairs?
[10:08.60]Oh, get up the stairs!
[10:09.64]I said I didn't kill him!
[10:11.78]I didn't kill him!
[10:13.32]Are you kidding me?
[10:13.92]Oh, my God!
[10:17.10]Oh, God!
[10:18.03]I just got killed by my own teammate!
[10:19.85]Dude, team killing.
[10:24.39]This is, like, the most realistic team killer game.
[10:28.15]You just go around and crush people.
[10:30.61]What am I, seven?
[10:31.48]Oh, goodness.
[10:33.40]Hey, I'm not doing too bad for my first time playing.
[10:38.63]Come here.
[10:40.25]This guy... You gotta be careful.
[10:42.00]I need to... Don't I have like a... What do I... Don't I have something else?
[10:44.42]Yeah, I got the throwing thing.
[10:45.98]Yeah.
[10:47.72]Got ya.
[10:48.38]Got ya.
[10:49.42]Oh.
[10:50.64]Got ya!
[10:51.58]Whoa!
[10:52.48]Did I... I thought... Did I... Okay, good.
[10:53.56]I didn't kill my teammate.
[10:54.37]I thought I just killed my teammate.
[11:01.45]Run!
[11:03.47]Run away!
[11:04.23]I feel like a Monty Python movie is about to play in the background here.
[11:07.36]Wow.
[11:09.91]Oh.
[11:10.27]Swarm him.
[11:10.83]Swarm him!
[11:11.59]Swarm him!
[11:12.43]Swarm him!
[11:13.07]They can't kill us all!
[11:15.73]They can't kill us all!
[11:16.99]Swarm his ass!
[11:22.94]I'm gonna kill this guy!
[11:26.24]Oh no!
[11:29.38]I don't wanna kill my own teammate.
[11:35.35]This guy's gotta die.
[11:36.89]Nice job.
[11:37.61]Nice job.
[11:39.16]This guy doesn't even know I'm behind him!
[11:41.80]Man, this guy's a blocking maniac!
[11:44.54]Oh, get out of the way, man!
[11:46.04]Okay, oh!
[11:50.22]Oh, it was a bone arrow.
[11:56.90]I don't even know how you win!
[11:59.45]Hold on, let me look at, like, the objectives.
[12:03.31]There's so much stuff going on!
[12:07.31]Oh, 1 minute and 33 seconds!
[12:08.31]I see, I see.
[12:11.30]Alright, I gotta get to ten kills.
[12:13.18]I gotta kill ten people.
[12:14.93]I gotta make something happen here.
[12:17.83]But yeah, if you were thinking about getting this game, and you didn't know, this game is a lot of fun.
[12:24.13]I love this game.
[12:26.30]Here we go, come on.
[12:26.96]I know you think I'm gonna fake you out, don't you?
[12:28.90]Come on.
[12:31.34]Come on, block it.
[12:32.04]Block it.
[12:32.62]Yeah, what you got?
[12:33.50]What you got?
[12:33.92]Oh, get your face smashed.
[12:36.35]Oh, come on.
[12:37.33]You want to get faked out?
[12:38.40]You want to get fucking stabbed?
[12:41.32]Swear word.
[12:42.36]Block it out.
[12:45.20]Oh, this game makes Jerma swear.
[12:47.46]You know it's crazy.
[12:49.74]What is this guy doing?
[12:56.14]Get him!
[12:58.14]Oh, kick him.
[12:58.64]Kick him in his face!
[12:59.40]Hey, I can swing down here.
[13:03.15]I got a narrow weapon.
[13:04.51]I'll just jab.
[13:06.50]That guy's dead.
[13:07.06]Good.
[13:07.70]Let's end this.
[13:09.02]Let's end this.
[13:11.18]Let's end this.
[13:14.34]Oh, come on.
[13:15.00]What do you say?
[13:15.66]What do you say, man?
[13:16.82]I'm gonna fake you out.
[13:17.64]I'm gonna fake you out.
[13:18.78]Oh, god.
[13:19.12]Behind me.
[13:20.50]Get out of my face, dude.
[13:23.42]Oh, no.
[13:23.94]2v1.
[13:23.98]This is not good.
[13:25.96]This is ridiculous.
[13:29.74]This is ridiculous.
[13:34.08]Get him!
[13:36.61]What?
[13:37.09]What?
[13:37.25]There's no way!
[13:38.11]There's no way!
[13:38.59]I blocked that!
[13:40.58]I blocked that!
[13:41.18]Did we win?
[13:44.35]I think so.
[13:45.07]Yeah, we won.
[13:46.19]Nice.
[13:47.74]Well, if you were thinking of getting this game, guys, this game is hilarious and a lot of fun.
[13:52.00]So I definitely recommend it.
[13:53.02]This is my first time playing.
[13:54.34]I'll probably play this again.
[13:55.82]Probably live stream or something like that.
[13:57.48]But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[13:59.61]So thank you so much for watching.
[14:00.67]Really do appreciate it.
[14:01.77]And I'll see you guys all soon.
[14:02.85]And of course, take care, everybody.
