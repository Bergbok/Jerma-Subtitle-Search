[00:27.88]You just instant died.
[00:32.44]That was okay.
[00:33.30]Funny, funny, funny, funny, funny.
[00:49.01]Skip, skip, skip.
[00:56.85]It's going in my video.
[00:59.59]It's going in my video, yes it is.
[01:01.64]No, it's not.
[01:03.08]What's your response to what you just did?
[01:06.54]Very quickly.
[01:07.62]I want to hear what's your response.
[01:09.78]I'm bored!
[01:12.64]I've got my gun.
[01:14.26]Oh, what do you guys got?
[01:16.75]What's going on over here, boys?
[01:18.51]Put your hands up.
[01:21.81]Put your fucking hands up.
[01:23.01]Hands in the air.
[01:25.21]Yeah, you need to...
[01:42.59]I destroyed it.
[01:43.47]That was like my game crashed.
[01:45.94]I'm trying to like negotiate with the guy.
[01:47.72]He threw a fucking axe in his head.
[01:51.30]He just looks left and right like, what the fuck do I do now?
[01:55.20]Yeah, he was like still alright.
[01:57.38]He had no idea what to do.
[01:58.08]He was like shocked.
[01:59.02]Yeah, you threw the axe in his head and for that like two seconds he was just like, oh shit.
[02:03.78]Okay, there's an axe in my fucking head.
[02:05.64]What am I doing?
[02:06.82]Do I run away?
[02:08.04]Got real dark real quick.
[02:10.41]I gotta grab some food or some supplies somewhere.
[02:12.29]Can I eat these trees?
[02:13.19]I don't know.
[02:14.41]I really just don't know anything about where I am right now.
[02:17.03]Who goes there?
[02:18.71]This is the tunnel and I'm its troll.
[02:21.32]What do you want?
[02:22.14]No, I just was looking for some food, looking for some supplies.
[02:25.00]I just wanted to find something.
[02:26.48]When I come in, I have food and supplies.
[02:28.77]I have both of those.
[02:29.57]I have a lot of them.
[02:30.65]Is this some kind of trick?
[02:32.34]No, I'm not a troll.
[02:34.58]All right.
[02:35.24]I believe you.
[02:35.74]Come in.
[02:35.96]Come in.
[02:36.56]Come in.
[02:37.46]What do you got there?
[02:38.22]Do you have any... I got this!
[02:39.32]Ah!
[02:40.42]What happened?
[02:40.80]I suggest you wait 30 or 40 seconds.
[02:44.17]Something real bad's coming.
[02:45.81]Didn't work.
[02:46.75]You gotta do it again.
[02:48.17]Can I eat these trees?
[02:49.63]Maybe I can chew on the bark and get some syrup.
[02:51.61]I really don't know.
[02:52.29]I'm just... What is that?
[02:54.01]Who goes there?
[02:55.37]Who tries to enter the tunnel of the troll?
[02:57.73]Not me.
[02:58.25]I was just looking for some supplies and maybe some food to eat.
[03:01.38]Well, hey, I have supplies and food all back here if you just want to come in the tunnel for a second.
[03:05.48]Some kind of trick?
[03:06.06]No, I'm not a troll.
[03:08.26]Oh, okay.
[03:09.07]I believe you.
[03:11.01]I really hope you have pizza rolls.
[03:12.69]What's this?
[03:14.81]What have you done to me?
[03:16.15]What have you done?
[03:17.71]I just wait like 30 to 40 seconds, microwave.
[03:20.47]What are you talking about?
[03:21.19]What am I waiting for?
[03:22.13]30 or 40 seconds?
[03:27.10]This joke is so bad.
[03:28.86]It is.
[03:29.56]It really is.
[03:30.76]This is worse than the fucking jump through the glass pop-tart joke.
[03:36.21]I'm gonna get you.
[03:36.85]I'm gonna get those secrets.
[03:37.95]I'm gonna get those troll secrets.
[03:39.41]I'll get those troll secrets.
[03:40.69]They're my secrets.
[03:41.63]Get away from me.
[03:42.37]Get away from me, you psycho.
[03:43.39]I'm a psycho troll.
[03:44.31]I fucking hate trolls.
[03:45.07]Let's get out of here.
[03:52.37]Why can't we not get the fuck off this stupid troll joke?
[03:57.11]I'm dropping out.
[03:58.36]We have to stop this now.
[04:03.18]Hey, it's me.
[04:04.10]Made it on top of one of the towers.
[04:08.78]You know we're both jumping off, right?
[04:11.24]Do you think we're not going to do that?
[04:13.88]There's a fucking zombie up here.
[04:17.45]Hold on.
[04:18.13]Don't do anything to him.
[04:19.67]How would you have ever made it up here?
[04:21.27]She doesn't even have a arm.
[04:23.49]This zombie is armed, one-armed climbed up here.
[04:26.35]Are you telling me that's what happened?
[04:28.81]No way.
[04:38.78]What if she got up and just climbed back up?
[04:42.88]Hurry, quickly, quickly, hurry.
[04:45.18]Oh, what the hell?
[04:50.70]It's a spitter!
[04:52.90]Uh, that cutscene just healed me.
[04:54.96]I'm shouting because this fucked up infected motherfucker with guts hanging out of his mouth just spit a bunch of toxic snot at me.
[05:01.40]This motherfucker... Toxic motherfucker with fucking snot in his mouth.
[05:06.89]Turn your light off.
[05:10.69]Oh, look, there's like a door here.
[05:12.11]What?
[05:12.53]Oh, whoa, I thought it was real.
[05:16.37]Alright, I want you to go through my time travel machine.
[05:20.13]As you see here, my lovely assistant, head on through and I'll see you in the year 1900!
[05:24.73]Oh, that's not as funny as I thought it was going to be.
[05:39.42]Hey, hey, it's okay.
[05:40.67]Are you all right, sir?
[05:42.03]Hey, you just dropped like 10,000 feet.
[05:45.15]I'm glad you're like, okay.
[05:46.51]Let's see.
[05:46.85]What were we doing earlier?
[05:47.84]Let's go.
[05:48.36]Let's go.
[05:48.90]Let's do parkour and jump.
[05:52.67]Oh, what are you doing?
[05:53.75]What does it look like I'm doing right now?
[06:01.12]What are you doing?
[06:03.20]I'm pushing the boat.
[06:04.26]No, what is he doing?
[06:05.56]What does it look like?
[06:09.62]I don't know what it looks like for you guys.
[06:14.40]I just want to ride the boat.
[06:16.42]I just want to keep jumping.
[06:21.11]Your animation looks ridiculous for me.
[06:25.17]You gonna get it?
[06:27.77]I got it.
[06:28.25]He got it.
[06:30.65]Got it.
[06:31.19]Got it.
[06:33.01]I got it.
[06:33.41]He got it.
[06:33.78]Alright, my turn.
[06:36.84]How did you even attempt to do that?
[06:38.30]I have no idea how you even tried that.
[06:39.68]There's a place you can stand where it's, like, completely... It's really, really easy to do.
[06:42.78]Alright, what if I, like, start to... If I start to fall, can I grab it, maybe?
[06:47.85]No, I wouldn't do it that way.
[06:49.81]Going for it.
[06:51.34]Look what I just fucking did.
[06:52.84]You want to talk about, like, falling and grabbing onto something?
[06:56.84]Wow, Trevor's the master of falling and grabbing onto things.
[07:00.94]I'm fucking the man.
[07:03.82]Back to square one.
[07:05.06]Everyone, I want all the actors at... No, shit.
[07:08.92]No, dude.
[07:09.98]Hey, just wait.
[07:10.82]Just wait, like, 30 seconds.
[07:12.52]Yeah, guess what?
[07:13.14]They're gonna...
[07:15.25]Come on!
[07:15.79]No!
[07:16.71]Get the fuck out of here!
[07:19.70]Run!
[07:20.08]Run!
[07:20.49]Run!
[07:20.95]Run!
