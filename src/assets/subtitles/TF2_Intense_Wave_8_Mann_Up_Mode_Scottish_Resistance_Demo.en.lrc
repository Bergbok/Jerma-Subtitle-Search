[00:08.82]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.54]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.72]Doing a lot of Team Fortress 2 the last couple of days, and that's because Man vs. Machine is just a ton of fun, and especially this Man Up mode.
[00:24.18]And the only way you can get into a Man Up mode server is if you buy one of these Tour of Duty tickets.
[00:29.63]They are 99 cents each.
[00:31.77]And these tickets allow you to not only play in the Man Up Mode servers, but after you complete one of these six missions, there's only six right now, you are going to consume that ticket, and it's going to give you a random item.
[00:44.78]Now, you are definitely going to be playing for these items.
[00:48.40]It is very, very difficult.
[00:50.20]As you'll see in this video, this is one of the most intense things ever that I've ever done in Team Fortress, or gaming in general.
[00:55.89]You're going to see some really intense moments here, stuff that comes down to the absolute wire.
[01:01.75]And I believe Shibby has this on his channel as well, if you want to see his perspective.
[01:05.75]Just wanted to give this video a brief introduction.
[01:08.23]Playing on the map Decoy, this is Wave 8 only.
[01:11.35]And I hope you guys enjoy the chaos that is about to ensue.
[01:14.96]So thank you guys so much for watching, really do appreciate it, and enjoy the live commentary.
[01:19.36]Take care, everybody.
[01:25.29]I need metal.
[01:26.15]I need ammo.
[01:27.79]I need ammo.
[01:35.68]Oh no.
[01:36.94]Give me that money.
[01:37.46]Oh my god, he's right here.
[01:39.36]You bastard.
[01:41.20]We don't need the money, remember?
[01:43.42]Oh, that's right.
[01:43.90]What am I doing?
[01:44.42]Well, actually, we kind of do.
