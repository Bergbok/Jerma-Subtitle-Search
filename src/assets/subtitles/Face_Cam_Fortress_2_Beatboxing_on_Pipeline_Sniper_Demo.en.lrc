[00:08.79]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:11.23]Jeremiah here with some Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:13.87]What's today?
[00:15.91]Monday?
[00:16.37]Sunday?
[00:17.45]I don't even know.
[00:18.25]Saturday?
[00:18.85]Saturday's edition, and oh my god.
[00:21.25]I'm playing as the sniper right now, which I don't know why I'm doing.
[00:23.85]Oh, come on.
[00:29.39]I got him.
[00:30.13]I got him.
[00:31.40]Yeah, playing as the sniper with the Hitman's Heatmaker.
[00:35.92]Yeah, I keep saying Hitman's Headtaker, because somebody in the comments of my last sniper video said that.
[00:41.40]And it actually rings a little bit better than the Heatmaker.
[00:45.50]Hitman's Heatmaker, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Tribalman's Shiv.
[00:50.51]Oh, come on, I get him.
[00:54.97]Looks like they're at the last point.
[00:56.73]This is on Pipeline.
[01:00.49]My... Alright.
[01:02.69]Maybe I shouldn't... No, I'm going to stay Sniper.
[01:05.59]I'm going to stay Sniper on principle alone.
[01:12.80]Alright, let's start a new day.
[01:13.82]Let's start a new day.
[01:18.18]Let's start a new day.
[01:23.08]And just like the previous video, I am going to time travel.
[01:27.60]So let's, uh, so here's the plane of existence right here.
[01:31.22]And this is where we want to be.
[01:32.80]This is the future right here.
[01:34.78]So if we can't just like... Okay, I think we made it, right?
[01:39.05]Oh yeah, five seconds left.
[01:41.03]I set it perfectly for one minute exactly, and it worked.
[01:43.81]So let's, uh, let's play some sniper and let's get some sniping shots.
[01:50.83]Oh man.
[01:53.62]Oh, baby.
[01:55.58]What?
[01:56.18]Spy, where is he?
[01:59.36]Oh, my God, you pesky little snake.
[02:03.95]Oh, if you didn't shoot me.
[02:06.29]Oh, my God.
[02:07.47]Oh, my God.
[02:09.37]Problem?
[02:09.89]Yeah, big problem.
[02:13.33]God, they're just... No, I can't even play Sniper right now.
[02:16.64]They're just rolling us way too good.
[02:18.24]I'm going to play... I'll play Demoman.
[02:21.48]I'm playing Demoman.
[02:22.50]I'm not kidding.
[02:23.95]We're not just gonna get, like, rolled here.
[02:25.75]Ooh, big problem.
[02:30.09]I kill plenty of birds.
[02:32.57]Oh, there's an uber out there.
[02:33.81]That's a spy standing right here.
[02:39.10]It's over.
[02:39.76]It's over right now.
[02:41.24]It is just over.
[02:44.36]I think we... Did anybody get one kill?
[02:48.52]Oh my god.
[02:49.62]Wow.
[02:53.62]Well, um, let's try this again.
[02:55.90]This time I'm gonna stay Demoman.
[02:58.16]I'm raring to go this time.
[03:00.32]Spam.
[03:00.90]Spam.
[03:01.50]Spam.
[03:02.79]Oh, I got hit with the spam.
[03:07.77]Oh, here we are.
[03:12.33]Oh, lobbing.
[03:13.21]Lobbing.
[03:13.85]Lobbing like Robin.
[03:15.39]Lobbing like Batman and Robin.
[03:18.88]Speaking of Batman...
[03:20.49]I gotta go see the Dark Knight Rises.
[03:22.41]I heard it's really, really good.
[03:25.25]Let's just roll.
[03:26.07]Let's just abso-freaking-lutely roll.
[03:28.54]Roll.
[03:29.04]Roll.
[03:30.24]Whoa.
[03:30.66]Whoa.
[03:34.88]This is just a sentry right here.
[03:36.50]What the hell is going on?
[03:39.46]I can't even take this thing out.
[03:42.34]There we go.
[03:43.32]It's gone.
[03:44.38]Whoa!
[03:46.35]Oh my god.
[03:46.99]Just chaos.
[03:47.85]Chaos.
[03:48.41]Absolute chaos.
[03:50.29]Oh my god.
[03:54.11]Oh, come on.
[03:54.73]Give me this.
[03:55.69]Give me this, please.
[03:56.59]Oh, what?
[03:59.45]What?
[04:00.21]What was that?
[04:01.26]What?
[04:02.44]I... I'm so speechless.
[04:06.74]I got him.
[04:07.30]I just got that guy.
[04:08.74]I can't believe I did not taunt kill that guy.
[04:18.06]Oh my god.
[04:21.74]He walked right into the blade.
[04:23.54]It hit him like right in his teeth.
[04:26.72]Oh, whatever.
[04:27.68]That is such BS, man.
[04:34.38]You are dead.
[04:35.92]Not a big surprise.
[04:40.44]Help me.
[04:40.68]Medic.
[04:42.76]Medic.
[04:44.11]Medic.
[04:45.25]Oh, you get it.
[04:45.81]You get it.
[04:46.13]You need it more than I do.
[04:47.29]Oh, no you don't.
[04:47.75]You have a sandwich.
[04:48.25]Never mind.
[04:54.97]Yikes.
[04:58.89]God, I can't do anything.
[05:01.31]I'm scared to go out here.
[05:04.65]Oh, no you don't.
[05:05.99]No you don't.
[05:07.38]Oh, there's a double.
[05:09.54]I've killed more people with this than anything else.
[05:14.85]Get rid of that stuff.
[05:17.59]I need a medic.
[05:19.27]I need a medic.
[05:20.25]No!
[05:20.49]I didn't want to take that out.
[05:21.33]That was a big mistake.
[05:24.62]I need a medic.
[05:26.62]Oh, oh, oh, I need a medic.
[05:28.84]Oh, spy.
[05:31.80]I just, like, almost threw up because I just ran around in a circle right there.

[05:38.60]I don't want you to lose your... What?
[05:40.64]What the hell?
[05:42.61]E-money.
[05:44.35]Of course it was e-money.
[05:48.57]I wanted to save that guy's Uber because I didn't want him to die.
[05:50.99]And look what happens.
[05:55.88]I need a medic.
[05:57.84]Oh, oh, oh, I need a medic.

[08:29.90]Where am I getting backstabs from?
[08:32.42]That's what I don't understand.
[08:33.40]There's just like three spies and they're all just like stuffing into me at the same time.
[08:37.98]And I'm like bumping it.
[08:39.02]Oh, excuse me.
[08:40.36]Oh, ma'am.
[08:40.96]Excuse me.
[08:41.68]And then I die.

[09:08.66]I thought... I thought I hit that sniper.
[09:10.14]That didn't make any sense.
[09:14.54]Oh, this game, man, is just ridiculous sometimes.

[09:18.09]We can't let them win.
[09:20.42]I'm just going to sticky jump all the way across like the whole... What?

[09:29.46]My heroics didn't work.
[09:31.36]We're gonna lose.

[09:33.18]All I can do is watch.
[09:34.82]Come on.
[09:35.40]Come on, soldier.
[09:44.89]It's okay.
[09:46.52]That's going to be it for this edition of Facecam Fortress 2.
