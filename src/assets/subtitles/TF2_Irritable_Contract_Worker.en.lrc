[00:08.68]Oh, we're like 20% of the way through this contract.
[00:11.96]I apologize.
[00:13.62]I was gonna start the video a while ago, and it was gonna be, uh... I only play as the Classic!
[00:18.81]But... I ended up, like, killing two people, and then, like, didn't record, and then, like, started recording.
[00:24.59]So now we're really recording, and there's a guy in the water.
[00:27.79]I gotta get this guy.
[00:29.25]He's fucking dead.
[00:30.97]Guy's dead.
[00:32.18]Alright, well, he's... Welcome to the video, guys!
[00:34.94]Where we shoot fucking people in the water that have been dead.
[00:38.54]For like 20 minutes.
[00:40.75]Can I kill this guy?
[00:43.33]Well, it wasn't a headshot, but... This is going a lot faster than I initially thought it was going to go.
[00:48.77]See if I can get a no-scope here.
[00:51.19]There we go.
[00:51.49]If I do that a few more times, the contract will be finished.
[00:56.35]I was under the impression that it was gonna be like, oh man, it's gonna take like fucking two hours.
[00:59.79]Oh, I missed that one.
[01:03.95]This is a good place to sit, though.
[01:06.26]No, it's not, because there's spies that come behind you.
[01:10.11]And what an irritated beginning to this video.
[01:12.58]I sound really irritated.
[01:13.82]Do I?
[01:14.02]Do I?
[01:14.36]Do I sound really irritated right now?
[01:15.88]Well, let's get rid of that.
[01:16.70]Let's, like, shake off the irritation.
[01:19.30]Hold on.
[01:20.84]Still irritated.
[01:22.24]As you can tell, I was still a little irritated.
[01:25.48]I gotta cast off the spell that is the irritation.
[01:29.04]And how we do that is I no-scope the first guy that I see.
[01:31.96]And then all of a sudden, like, I'm feeling fine, you know?
[01:36.48]First person I see literally comes in this doorway.
[01:39.99]is going to wipe my slate clean.
[01:42.29]This guy, right, this guy, ready, ready, ready!
[01:44.60]Still irritated.
[01:49.12]No, that wasn't a headshot!
[01:50.66]Still slightly irritated!
[01:53.48]No, I'm not allowed to do that.
[01:56.83]Uh... I'll get him, I'll get him!
[01:58.71]I, like, didn't even let go.
[02:02.93]I'll get him.
[02:04.07]Come here.
[02:06.65]I was hoping I was gonna, like, luckily shoot him right in the face.
[02:11.70]I'm being so useless right now.
[02:13.25]Please!
[02:13.99]Please!
[02:15.69]I... no?
[02:17.47]I'm still a little upset.
[02:19.27]I can't get it off.
[02:20.01]I gotta headshot this guy.
[02:21.11]I've gotta get this guy right now.
[02:24.35]Fuck!
[02:25.33]Come on!
[02:26.87]I'm in the right spot for this.
[02:31.32]And he's pistolling me!
[02:32.20]This guy's pistolling me and I can't even shoot him.
[02:34.48]Oh, how irritating!
[02:42.34]What just happened?
[02:44.76]Oh.
[02:45.88]Right.
[02:51.91]I'm so focused on the top stairs.
[02:53.69]I just have total tunnel vision.
[02:55.11]I had tunnel vision on Sniper without being zoomed in.
[02:59.93]Wait for it.
[03:00.49]Wait for it.
[03:00.93]God, it's the releasing the button on the finger is what's giving me the finger... Get away from me.
[03:07.22]I don't have to...
[03:11.71]I promise I'm not a spy.
[03:18.45]Come on down here, show me, show me your face.
[03:21.37]I'd love to see it.
[03:24.55]Oh fuck, oh fuck, he went to the point, he went to the point, he went to the point.
[03:28.19]How?
[03:30.21]DEE!
[03:30.73]I don't know what happened today, did I like, did somebody spit in my coffee today?
[03:42.09]Like, why am I this, like, irritable?
[03:45.73]I shouldn't be.
[03:47.97]Maybe I, like, woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
[03:50.69]That's pop- Ooh!
[03:52.68]Whoo-hoo!
[03:53.54]Whoo!
[03:54.50]Guys, I feel like a new man!
[03:55.90]Hey, you know that- You know when you feel like a new man?
[03:57.64]Well, that- I feel- You know what?
[03:58.76]I feel like a new man right now.
[04:00.28]Let's play some Team Fortress 2!
[04:02.56]My coffee was really- My coffee was really good this morning.
[04:04.96]Nobody spit in my- Did someone- Nobody definitely spit in my coffee this morning.
[04:12.62]This weapon is fucking impossible to use.
[04:18.23]This weapon is so hard to use, holy fuck.
[04:22.47]If this weapon wasn't the worst weapon in the whole game, I would have killed that guy.
[04:27.84]No, no, no, no, no, don't.
[04:29.36]Getting irritated again.
[04:31.98]This is gonna be a good place to finish this up.
[04:34.50]That is a spy, that you are a spy.
[04:37.40]Perfect opportunity.
[04:42.90]Fuck me, man.
[04:45.34]He's gonna get backstabbed.
[04:47.10]There's nothing- and I could have prevented that.
[04:50.26]Don't.
[04:51.16]Don't do it.
[04:54.14]Do you see how long that took?
[04:57.32]That took so long!
[04:59.78]To be able to headshot that guy, that guy did a little dance, and ducked out of the corner, and then by the time he came back, I was ready to shoot him.
[05:07.91]It was a long charge-up time.
[05:10.92]I lowered my sensitivity a shitload to try to compensate for my mom, my fucking lord.
[05:14.70]I have to concentrate so much while I do this.
[05:18.52]I feel like I'm taking a math test.
[05:22.32]Did I get a good grade?
[05:23.24]On my Ultra Concentrate math exam?
[05:27.52]Fucking Algebra 2, whatever the hell it is.
[05:29.50]Nope.
[05:31.94]See, this is the opportunity where this gun is supposed to shine.
[05:34.16]Around a corner, like that.
[05:38.87]Only got to do that a couple more times.
[05:40.91]You know, we got a good opportunity right here.
[05:44.15]Come on.
[05:44.71]Bring it on.
[05:46.61]I'll shoot you through the fucking laundry chute.
[05:51.79]No spies, no spies.
[05:54.16]I can almost be done with this contract.
[05:55.64]I thought the flowers, I thought those were stickies on the red team.
[05:58.84]Freaks me out for a second.
[06:02.42]That's me.
[06:03.48]That's me.
[06:03.92]I almost didn't understand what was going on.
[06:06.44]I just had an out-of-body experience.
[06:12.46]Fuck!
[06:13.58]No!
[06:19.67]Screw it, I'll hit you with the ham.
[06:27.89]Go on and delete that thing.
[06:28.91]I gotta, like, bump my head.
[06:30.13]That's it.
[06:31.81]We're done.
[06:32.55]We're done.
[06:33.33]We are done.
[06:34.33]We're done.
[06:35.09]We're done.
[06:36.19]We're done.
[06:36.43]I got it.
[06:36.91]We're done.
[06:37.57]Contract over.
[06:40.19]We're just, for good measure, we're just going to sit in the fucking water.
[06:42.81]Why am I still on fire?
[06:43.83]Come on, please submerge.
[06:45.21]We're done.
[06:46.49]Give me my box.
[06:48.47]Give me my box.
[06:50.07]What do I got?
[06:50.61]I want to see what I get.
[06:52.97]Come on, have it be something good.
[06:55.09]Something good.
[06:57.57]Congratulations.
[06:58.95]You have just been given the opportunity to spend $2.50.
[07:01.41]Fuck it, we're doing it.
[07:04.43]Uh, yes, I'm sure.
[07:07.70]I'm sure.
[07:08.06]Let's see.
[07:08.56]Was this worth it?
[07:10.38]Was it worth it?
[07:10.84]What's inside?
[07:14.06]Holy shit.
[07:16.46]Holy shit, okay.
[07:19.38]That's, uh... That's, that's worth it.
[07:23.04]That's Factory New, Purple Ranger, that's... Oh my fucking lord.
[07:31.83]And it's a sniper!
[07:34.69]My mood just went from irritated and upset and annoyed into... Alright!
[07:41.24]Okay, we got factory new purple range.
[07:44.86]I'm not even close to being irritated anymore.
