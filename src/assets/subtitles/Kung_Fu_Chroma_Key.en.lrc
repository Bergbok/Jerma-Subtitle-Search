[00:10.58]I look like shit right there.
[00:13.98]Couldn't have taken a better picture?
[00:15.10]Why is it the same picture?
[00:18.16]Oh no, I got sucked into the comic book.
[00:22.60]Come on.
[00:24.54]Let's go, come on.
[00:25.86]Come fight me.
[00:27.98]Get fucking slapped.
[00:36.93]Yeah, you wanna see how we do a backflip into the double slap?
[00:43.15]Fuck.
[00:45.40]I got two, I gotta fight two of them.
[00:49.38]Just come closer, come on.
[00:51.62]Dude, I'm just going with the slaps now.
[00:55.71]Good, good, good.
[01:02.27]Ooh, got the kick.
[01:06.29]Oh, she just kicked me right in the face!
[01:08.11]What the fuck am I doing, by the way?
[01:09.43]Why am I, like, sitting on the ground?
[01:11.39]Got him with the uppercut.
[01:19.01]Get him with the power punch!
[01:20.01]He's not kicking him!
[01:24.14]Yeah, did you see that kick?
[01:28.86]Where did I end up?
[01:30.68]How did I get up here?
[01:32.88]Alright.
[01:34.22]How do I get down?
[01:36.64]Like, I gotta jump over again, right?
[01:41.65]Shit.
[01:43.09]Am I, like... Can I go down, like, this ladder?
[01:46.29]I don't think I can go down the ladder.
[01:50.39]I'm stuck up here!
[01:54.73]What the fuck?
[01:57.72]Here we go.
[02:01.60]Let me guess.
[02:02.52]Your first time...
[02:11.48]Boxes give me the box Give me the trash can oh fuck I just hit my handle Yeah, that's like I call that the window washer get cleaned up I
[02:35.62]Oh, you?
[02:37.00]Oh, you?
[02:37.42]Heh, I saved the best for you.
[02:39.50]Shit, this game's fucking hard.
[02:52.80]Stay low.
[02:56.58]Dude, look at the... How are you supposed to beat this guy unless you stay low?
[03:02.48]I can't even see what's going on on the screen.
[03:03.77]All I know is I'm kicking his ass.
[03:06.88]I've literally... I beat him.
[03:07.92]I beat him.
[03:09.74]Victory.
[03:10.04]Did I just say... I'm getting, like, really tired right now.
[03:14.72]Because unlike any other game that's like this... I, like, really have to fight these guys.
[03:35.83]It's not like I have to, like, pretend punch.
[03:38.33]I have to really fucking punch these guys.
[03:40.91]I have to, like, actually throw swings.
[03:43.89]You know?
[03:44.55]And fucking ground pounds.
[03:55.55]Is this how fast I can fucking run?
[04:07.75]I'm back.
[04:09.44]This time I'm brandishing a weapon.
[04:12.46]This lightsaber or $4.52 grocery store wiffle ball bat is going to help me achieve victory.
[04:31.08]Just call me baseball player.
[04:42.33]Did I die?
[04:43.09]Even with a baseball bat!
[04:55.78]I broke something.
[05:00.38]It was a lampshade.
[05:01.64]Don't worry.
[05:02.01]See what I got?
[05:03.71]Out of here.
[05:04.19]See what I got in my hands?
[05:04.97]It was a ball bat.
[05:08.11]Fucking god!
[05:09.65]I can't use this!
[05:13.21]Here we go.
[05:13.83]Nice and easy.
[05:15.56]Just like you're hitting the ball up midfield past the second baseman.
[05:19.26]Then you can cue up a power attack in a second.
[05:22.00]Right when he's at pretty much like low health, we're going to cue up a power swing for a home run.
[05:27.88]Here we go.
[05:28.24]This is what we're going to do.
[05:29.52]We're going to step into it.
[05:43.97]We're good.
[05:44.85]Hey, hey!
[05:47.89]This is stupid.
[05:48.99]This is extremely dangerous.
[05:50.79]Like, what I'm doing right now could be the dumbest idea I've ever had.
[05:54.85]Hey, let me go buy a wiffle ball bat and, like, put duct tape all around it so you can see it so I can just break all this shit in my room.
[06:00.89]What was I thinking?
[06:02.68]What was I thinking?
[06:03.48]Seriously, what was I thinking?
[06:06.10]I don't even need that weapon.
[06:10.70]See?
[06:11.89]I'm actually doing better without the weapon, and my shit in my room is intact.
[06:18.72]One more.
[06:20.08]Come on.
[06:23.20]Shit, I missed.
[06:23.84]I got...
