[00:47.94]Hey.
[00:48.42]It's, uh, me.
[00:51.60]We're a little early today.
[00:52.46]I have about 30 minutes.
[00:55.96]I owe it to you guys to be early sometimes.
[00:57.77]You know, I owe it to you to be early.
[01:00.33]So, for every, like, time I was, like, 45 minutes late, you get one minute.
[01:08.04]It's 6.30 right now, so the last, like, 30 streams have started at, like, 7.30, 7.20, 7.40.
[01:12.80]That's one minute per offense.
[01:18.53]I've got a 30-year sentence.
[01:22.15]So, I mean, right now you're getting a 30-year sentence for being late.
[01:29.53]I know I'm not playing Battlegrounds.
[01:31.73]We've got a couple of things we're doing.
[01:34.34]Who knows?
[01:34.72]If they're gonna be any good, but that's it.
[01:36.76]Welcome to the Jerma.
[01:39.22]985 Community.
[01:41.14]Well... Sometimes.
[01:48.60]Sometimes.
[01:50.12]All the time.
[01:51.68]Yeah, we play... IRL Artstream?
[01:53.76]No.
[01:55.59]Sunday is probably going to be the IRL stream.
[01:57.35]I still need to buy a few things.
[01:59.53]To make it worth it.
[02:01.33]That stream's going to be like 40 minutes.
[02:02.91]Because there's going to be a lot of clean up.
[02:05.93]Sunday's stream is not going to be long, but it'll be worthwhile.
[02:09.79]I hope.
[02:10.99]That's what I say.
[02:11.75]I hope it will be.
[02:13.23]It might just be fucking awful.
[02:21.49]Am I going to testify in front of the Senate for my lateness?
[02:23.65]I'm not late today.
[02:29.28]Alright, well, we're gonna play, we're gonna start today.
[02:31.01]Thank you for all the subs that just came in, thank you.
[02:34.63]It's not Until Dawn.
[02:36.45]We have three things that we can do today.
[02:39.77]I would start until, I just, this fucking capture card nonsense, man, it's really got me.
[02:44.63]Any hints on the IRL stream?
[02:46.21]Of course.
[02:47.29]I'm going to be building a PC.
[02:48.87]I'm going to be doing a PC build stream.
[02:50.75]I've got some parts that I picked up and I want to be able to build a new computer.
[02:55.87]So we're going to be building a PC live on Twitch.
[02:58.21]It's sponsored by a couple of companies.
[03:01.06]I hope you guys enjoy it.
[03:03.62]It should be a lot of fun.
[03:12.83]It's a good PC build.
[03:13.57]I'm gonna give you guys a lot of different tips.
[03:15.97]Because a lot of people don't know how to build computers and they're not sure how to do it.
[03:21.20]So I need to make sure that I teach you guys how to properly build a PC and that's what we're gonna do on Sunday.
[03:30.22]Unless something really bad happens and it has to wait till after E3.
[03:33.46]Because, by the way, I'm going to E3.
[03:37.32]If you are going to be in that Los Angeles convention area,
[03:43.79]I'll be at E3 and we'll exchange information because I'm going to hit your car.
[03:49.18]And then we're going to have to go to the fucking precinct.
[03:51.16]And we're going to have to find out what I did and how I did it and what I did wrong.
[03:59.06]Anyway, let's switch this over.
[04:00.71]Enough people have trickled in here.
[04:03.65]For us to go like this.
[04:05.71]And go like this.
[04:08.73]And go like that.
[04:11.52]So this is where we're going to start today.
[04:13.48]I don't know how well this is going to go.
[04:14.82]This might be bad.
[04:15.58]It could be good.
[04:16.10]I guess we're going to play Passaportante, which is a starving artist.
[04:22.08]Passaporte.
[04:22.92]Whatever, however you pronounce this.
[04:24.55]How do you pronounce this?
[04:26.87]Passaponte.
[04:28.29]Whatever.
[04:32.27]It's a pretty good game.
[04:32.89]This is a good game?
[04:35.77]Nice.
[04:40.23]Yeah, I'm just seeing what people are saying.
[04:45.01]Okay, new career.
[04:48.50]I'm just seeing what people are saying.
[04:51.22]Active on new beginnings.
[04:51.90]This is a game where you paint and you sell your paintings and you gotta level up.
[04:59.70]And like a resident mod leather jacket was just like just right there.
[05:03.96]Quick and easy to start painting.
[05:07.88]And that's the cash register.
[05:09.03]Hold on.
[05:09.33]Wait, that's not an easel.
[05:11.79]Alright, where's the easel?
[05:13.19]Right there.
[05:15.13]I think I get to be fucking Kermit the Frog.
[05:16.61]Alright, so I just have to start painting.
[05:21.14]Uh... Stroke size.
[05:26.06]Alright, let's make it easy.
[05:27.16]Let's make it really easy at first.
[05:28.70]You know, let's... Uh...
[05:38.78]Okay.
[05:40.99]I call this one... The Abyss!
[06:02.24]Okay.
[06:02.66]I didn't like this guy.
[06:03.98]This, like, French guy, apparently.
[06:08.01]Single color canvas.
[06:09.05]So overdone.
[06:09.97]Well, he really actually knows about it.
[06:16.55]Do I just keep going?
[06:18.09]I don't understand.
[06:18.64]Where's the rest of my tutorial?
[06:20.60]I just walk around with a knife?
[06:24.44]This person's going to like this.
[06:25.42]This person's really edgy.
[06:26.30]They're going to say, like, wow, man, totally feel it.
[06:29.86]See how revolutionary.
[06:31.48]That's all it took.
[06:32.18]Did I make any money?
[06:34.14]No, I...
[06:37.63]Okay, here we go, here we go.
[06:39.85]I get the idea now.
[06:44.11]This time we're going to channel... I'm going to get real deep with you guys right now.
[06:46.97]Ready?
[06:47.13]Okay.
[07:00.06]See, right now what we're doing is we're making the cookie monsters.
[07:09.90]You think they're going to recognize this from Sesame Street?
[07:15.91]Look at my guy.
[07:16.87]Okay.
[07:19.01]Cookie Monster have red eyes.
[07:21.89]What color is the Cookie Monster's actual eyeballs?
[07:30.22]No, hold on.
[07:30.62]How do I go back?
[07:33.22]Hold on.
[07:33.60]I need this.
[07:41.87]How do I go back?
[07:47.03]I didn't do this right.
[07:48.67]I didn't do this right.
[07:49.45]Hold on.
[07:49.75]I need to go back.
[07:51.61]I don't think I can go back.
[07:53.33]This is supposed to be a cookie.
[08:00.53]I gotta just make this a cookie real quick.
[08:02.85]But it's a blue cookie, alright?
[08:04.07]Sometimes cookies are blue and they have like sprinkles on them.
[08:11.86]This is like cherry flavoring.
[08:13.24]Alright, hold on.
[08:22.01]It's supposed to be a cookie.
[08:23.81]It's paint.
[08:24.29]There's no going back.
[08:25.17]What does this thing do?
[08:26.43]Can I do anything?
[08:27.07]Do I have to sell a painting?
[08:28.09]Do I have to have the sun on the background?
[08:30.75]Okay, there we go.
[08:31.65]There's the sun.
[08:37.62]It's Cookie Monster with a surfboard in his mouth.
[08:43.58]And he has to be, like, holding a gun.
[08:47.93]He has, like, a hand up here.
[08:54.01]Cookie... Yeah, he's... You know, Cookie Monster sometimes carries a gun.
[09:03.07]Okay.
[09:13.12]What do I do with this now?
[09:17.09]Okay, that's it.
[09:17.71]Let's just sell it.
[09:19.23]Can anybody buy this?
[09:26.68]Uh... No, um...
[09:43.41]Cookies and carnage!
[09:47.19]Is someone gonna buy it?
[09:51.77]The artist seems to know their craft.
[09:53.65]He wants to buy it.
[09:54.23]Okay.
[09:54.85]For how much?
[09:55.25]60 bucks?
[09:55.57]Get the fuck out of here.

[10:03.92]Because this one's- this one's gone.
[10:06.92]Get- get- Get that out of here.
[10:10.44]Does it cost money to make paintings?
[10:13.64]Why are you painting without passion?
[10:16.84]TV drama about a horse actor receives general fair... Wait, we're gonna... Okay, we have to stay relevant, right?

[24:38.07]In a rainbow?
[24:38.47]Let's go a little thicker.
[24:45.89]I think it looks like this, right?
[24:46.97]Uh-huh.
[25:05.72]Alright, that's close enough, right?

[26:07.15]That's a fucking real period piece!
[26:10.45]No gold here.

[26:24.24]Resistance.
[26:25.30]No, no, no.
[26:25.86]Whatever.
[26:26.12]We're talking about leprechauns.
[26:28.05]Alright.
[26:30.61]What did that just say?
[26:35.39]That's not a period piece.
[26:38.29]Yes it is, because like back in the day people thought that you could get fucking gold at the end of a rainbow.
[26:42.06]People used to actually go do that back in like the 1400s.
[26:45.76]They would get in their horse and buggy and they would go to the fucking end of the rainbow.
[26:49.66]But guess what?
[26:50.02]There is no end of the rainbow.
[26:50.90]It's an optical illusion.
[26:51.92]So all these fucking idiots will like go and look for gold in California and they weren't going to find it.
[26:58.68]It is, that's a period piece.
[27:00.64]We're talking about like the 1400s.
[27:07.45]Shoes for dogs.

[50:01.85]So I'm gonna say it's like... Is it a blue ribbon?
[50:14.60]Is the UN symbol a blue ribbon?
[50:18.10]I think it is.

[51:04.21]He's really fat.
[51:09.06]Oh, shit.
[51:13.24]He's naked.
[51:16.40]Hold on, Santa's not supposed to be naked right now.
[51:23.07]Fuck.
[51:23.53]Whoops.

[51:59.26]And he has white too, right?
[52:05.42]He's dead.
[52:07.66]Someone's like flying Santa's dead corpse over the children of the United Nations to show them like there is no fucking hope.
[52:17.40]Some sick motherfucker is like trying to torture the world.
[52:20.86]Santa's not even safe.
[52:24.97]They're like flying him over the world to let him know.
[52:28.73]That's so terrible.
[52:30.79]No, Santa's alive.

[52:54.26]Oh, that's so stupid.
[52:56.89]Does Santa have a hat, right?
[52:57.85]He has one of those goofy hats.

[56:42.39]Just imagine this is the reindeer.
[56:45.77]It's like, no.
[56:46.87]There's reindeer attached to this.

[57:36.85]Alright, that's it.
[57:37.59]It's over.

[58:48.54]Okay?
[58:50.22]Squares in a Field.
[58:56.67]Squares in a Field.
[59:01.79]This one's gonna be abstract.
[59:02.95]I'm not looking for any real sense of direction here.
[59:08.74]This is just squares in a field.
[59:20.05]Okay.

[61:34.97]That guy wants to buy it.
[61:36.01]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[61:37.83]A spark of life squares in a field.
[61:41.34]The hipsters are having a meeting to discuss your rising popularity.
[61:43.96]Okay, the Daily Bagel, this is... Squares in a Field by Pasaporte.
[61:48.69]It was only recently that I heard of Pasaporte, a quirky young artist with a passion for growth.
[61:53.65]As I walked down the crime-stricken alley, I embraced the air of unhealthy mold before being entranced by the piece on the table.
[62:00.41]From a distance, I was struck with the craftsmanship.
[62:02.76]As I approached the piece, my heart fluttered with excitement.
[62:05.08]As I came closer, it ushered in a sense of childish happiness.
[62:09.30]Upon closer inspection, the intriguing details of the dark teal contrasted by the profusion of lime reminded me of my home.
[62:15.82]The use of green clearly represents earlier poisonous relationships.
[62:19.99]All in all, squares in a field is a good effort.
[62:22.91]Passaport has a lot of potential.
[62:25.19]I can certainly recommend my readers to visit Passaport in the future.
[62:31.08]Master the craft.
[62:34.76]Sold for $58.
[62:36.78]And like Santa dead in a sleigh was $1,200.
[62:39.10]I've got my own studio now.
[62:43.80]I unlocked a new tool, the pen tool.
[62:46.53]Alright, so there's more.
[62:52.97]There's more to the game.
[62:53.83]Got it.
[62:54.55]Cool.
[62:56.27]Now what?
[62:57.57]Can I do anything else?
[63:00.29]How much money do I have?
[63:03.24]I currently have $2,600, $2,700 almost.
[63:04.58]Okay, rent.
[63:05.26]I think rent went up too.
[63:11.89]Can anything else be interacted with?
[63:13.25]No.
[63:15.41]Now this is a more controlled approach.
[63:20.07]Ooh!
[63:23.25]Okay, nice.
[63:27.67]That actually is a lot easier.
[63:31.92]Okay, so trash this.
[63:35.96]Um... I'm gonna go with... This is my first painting in my new studio.
[63:42.71]This has been my dream.
[63:44.39]So we're gonna do... Dreams... Dreams of Aspiration.
[63:51.37]Because you know I made it.
[63:53.64]You know, when I got my first Twitch subscriber, I felt the same way.
[63:57.33]Dreams of aspirations.
[63:58.63]I'm going to put that on paper.
[64:00.71]And then we're going to see what that looks like.
[64:01.93]Dreams of aspirations is what happens when you make it.
[64:05.91]When you fucking feel that you've made it and you've got, like, a success.
[64:09.15]This is what I would paint.
[64:18.34]It's got to come to me.
[64:19.24]It's got to come to me.
[64:19.76]I've got to wait.
[64:20.42]Give me a second.
[64:20.76]It's got to come to me.
[64:23.26]I'm putting myself in that mindset again, like the first subscriber on Twitch.
[64:31.78]Yeah!
[64:33.52]No, that was a joke.
[64:34.84]That was a joke.
[64:37.36]No!
[64:37.78]No, you know what?
[64:39.56]We're keeping it.
[64:49.31]Okay.
[64:52.87]That's for me.
[64:53.44]That's not for you.
[64:54.88]I'm kidding.
[64:57.04]Get rid of it.
[64:58.16]I can't get rid of it.
[64:59.08]Fuck.
[64:59.42]Whatever.
[64:59.74]This time we're going to do the real one.
[65:06.74]That was the knee-jerk reaction.
[65:09.13]Now we're going to do the real one.
[65:22.57]To the sky.
[65:23.24]These are clouds.
[65:31.77]We're up in the sky here.
[65:32.79]I need to make sure everyone needs to be aware this is the sky.
[65:38.31]Okay.
[65:41.06]Okay.
[65:53.43]Actually, the pen tools are cool, but this is kind of a waste of time.
[66:02.40]Holy shit, it's like $300 a month to live here.
[66:12.98]Squares in a field, part two.
[66:15.02]Do the background first.
[66:16.12]Yeah, but, like, I know.
[66:18.50]I just freaked out, because I needed to make sure you guys were aware of how I felt.
[66:22.04]When I got my first ever Twitch subscriber.
[66:28.62]It was a rainy day that day.
[66:31.19]Clouds were in the sky.
[66:34.55]All I could think was... Man, today was not good.
[66:39.73]Car was out of gas for the last time.
[66:42.53]I wasn't going to live like that anymore.
[66:48.04]But through the darkness...
[66:50.93]I saw those multiple suns.
[66:54.53]And in my mind, I knew I was doing the right thing.
[66:58.47]I was going to reach it.
[66:59.53]I was going to make it.
[67:00.41]And I reached my face up into those clouds.
[67:12.99]And I said, Honey, I'm going to do it.
[67:15.98]Sure, take it.
[67:30.12]I wanted to get up there as fast as I could and make my eyes like a different color so you could actually see them.
[67:39.86]And I just... And as I was going up... Shit, I had like... Hold on.
[67:46.64]And upon my ascension... I made sure I wanted to fucking snap a selfie.
[67:54.26]This is me going like... Yes!
[67:56.21]Like putting my fist down, you know what I mean?
[68:06.30]Just for some reason I'd be able to remember this moment forever.
[68:15.76]It just kind of looks like I'm being cooked in a pan with eggs.
[68:18.01]Yeah, so... So we're poaching eggs.
[68:26.33]I'm glad you guys get to see me getting, like, poached.
[68:28.29]Like, with my fucking favorite fruit.
[68:31.61]My favorite fruit.
[68:34.40]Oh, okay.
[68:34.92]There we go.
[68:35.56]That's what I felt like that first day.
[68:37.68]Ascending up into the eggs.
[68:49.49]I didn't fill my skin enough.
[68:55.94]What was it?
[68:57.10]Dreams?
[69:03.36]Dreams of Aspiration.
[69:10.03]This one... This one's going to be... Oh, shit.
[69:14.03]I fucked it all up.
[69:15.65]I just grabbed the screen.
[69:16.94]Whoops.
[69:17.08]Can you guys still see?
[69:18.44]Okay, yeah, you can.
[69:20.72]We're just going to go straight up.
[69:21.72]I'm not even going to think.
[69:33.22]No thinking.
[69:33.88]No thinking allowed here.
[69:52.69]I'm not thinking about this at all.
[70:12.64]Feel it flowing through me.
[70:15.12]Got it.
[70:24.56]Done.
[70:24.70]Another one.
[70:25.42]Another one.
[70:30.01]No thought.
[70:41.71]Come on, write it.
[70:45.07]Another one.
[70:54.56]One more.
[71:11.84]Sorry, I'm not talking I'm like really trying to concentrate on my art
[71:55.76]I'm doing it.
[72:18.78]Okay.
[72:19.82]I got my creative juices out of me.
[72:22.87]Now let's actually... Let's actually do it now.
[72:31.35]What was the thing in the news?
[72:35.82]Thanks for the 30 bucks for the... I need to stop.
[72:38.58]No more fucking around.
[72:39.30]I need to make money.
[72:40.56]I'm gonna lose.
[72:43.44]The only thing that they wanted was the shit coil.
[72:46.34]Nobody wanted anything else.
[72:47.36]Really?
[72:50.33]I won't invest in this.
[72:52.31]Whatever you say, Giorgio.
[72:57.41]Bits ignored.
[72:58.23]Oh, God!
[73:01.43]Never trust a purple just gave a hundred bucks like two or three minutes ago.
[73:05.33]Somebody gave me a hundred dollars in real life and I didn't even see it.
[73:08.79]What a fucking piece of shit I am.
[73:10.95]But anyways, thank you, purple.
[73:12.79]For the hundred dollars.
[73:14.59]Jerma, you're asleep.
[73:15.53]Wake up.
[73:15.97]This is your subconscious reaching out to you.
[73:21.83]Am I awake?
[73:22.55]Am I asleep?
[73:23.11]I don't know.
[73:24.73]But thank you, Never Trust Purple.
[73:26.21]You are very, very, very much an investor in this stream.
[73:31.34]You invested in one of these panics more than once.
[73:34.48]So thanks, dude.
[73:35.94]Also, a whole of one zombie earlier, I did say hello, but they say those squares are going to haunt us all.
[73:41.76]But thank you for the $15.
[73:43.26]Much appreciated.
[73:45.71]Much love.
[73:47.35]And back we go.
[73:48.67]I won't invest in this.
[73:53.18]If I'm asleep, then what are we?
[73:54.41]Interesting life.
[73:55.03]Okay, people are starting to wear wigs and shit now.
[73:56.75]I gotta make these look proper.
[73:57.97]Okay, let's start with... Actually, can I... Let's go with green.
[74:06.71]I wanna do a pond.
[74:08.15]We're gonna do a pond with some frogs.
[74:10.55]Let's do the background first.
[74:13.05]This is gonna be a pond, so it's gonna be green.
[74:15.55]No.
[74:16.43]Eggs cause disease according to... Okay.
[74:18.47]No, fuck that.
[74:19.21]I'm doing my pond the way that I want.
[74:22.97]How do I start this?
[74:28.07]Like that, I think.
[74:34.46]Let's get some blue in here.
[74:35.64]Let's get this.
[74:47.98]It's gonna be bird's eye view of the pond.
[74:49.58]Okay.
[74:50.90]Okay.
[74:58.28]There you go.
[74:58.98]That's that.
[74:59.52]Maybe, like, an extra little thing over here.
[75:02.32]Like, you know, it tapers off a little bit.
[75:03.70]Doesn't have to be, like, exact.
[75:04.85]It could be a stream, too.
[75:08.05]Could be a stream.
[75:09.49]And, like, they have, like, divots and dents and shit, right?
[75:13.71]Okay.
[75:14.23]So, now... Get some lily pads.
[75:18.68]We just need a few.
[75:20.18]I'm gonna go with the light green for these, though.
[75:31.70]A couple of dark green ones.
[75:36.14]Okay, that looks alright.
[75:41.13]Let's make this a little more detailed.
[75:49.30]No, that's the same color, hold on.
[76:00.32]Okay, that's fine.
[76:05.36]Okay.
[76:05.84]No, fuck.
[76:10.56]Alright, there's our lily pads.
[76:13.47]This is Twister for colorblind people.
[76:15.71]No, it's not.
[76:18.73]Yeah, think about art, guys.
[76:19.91]It takes a little while before it goes.
[76:21.19]So this is gonna be a double piece.
[76:24.37]That's what you fucking... This is what you uncultured idiots don't understand.
[76:29.29]This is... Not only is this a top-down...
[76:32.08]picture of a pond, it's also the, uh, the glaria that's inside the pond.
[76:39.64]This is, you know, you know what the glaria is?
[76:41.07]That, that, that thing when you go into, like, a dirty pond and it can, like, kill you?
[76:44.21]It's like a, it's a, it's a, uh, a disease.
[76:46.81]It's like a parasite.
[76:47.91]That's the parasite as well as the pond.
[76:50.41]It's a double period piece.
[76:51.85]So, thank you.
[76:53.53]Sorry, I'm gonna, I'm gonna continue my work now.
[76:55.02]Please brush off.
[76:58.08]So, here we go.
[76:58.92]Um...
[77:01.02]Let's go with this color blue.
[77:03.92]Let's get the outline here.
[77:04.82]This one.
[77:11.06]Get a nice little beach to it.
[77:15.91]Clean that up.
[77:18.45]Bring that over here.
[77:27.15]Looks pretty good so far, I'm gonna say.
[77:28.99]I mean, some people might not agree, but I think it looks alright.
[77:35.03]Shit, I'm losing money.
[77:36.07]I have to... This has to be a good one.
[77:38.45]No fucking around.
[77:40.41]How do you draw a frog?
[77:41.83]I need like a... I'm gonna have to do like yellow frogs.
[77:46.09]Um... Shit, it's gonna have to be like a little...
[78:04.29]This is just like fucking sombreros.
[78:06.09]This is fantastic.
[78:19.52]No, they will turn into frogs.
[78:21.28]Just wait.
[78:22.94]Everybody don't have a meltdown.
[78:25.26]They're gonna be frogs in a very few seconds.
[78:38.97]All you need to do to make a frog is it needs to have a raised head.
[78:46.69]And big eyes.
[78:48.65]See, watch.
[78:49.07]You guys didn't think these were going to be frogs?
[78:51.73]Yeah?
[78:52.45]Well, what do you think now?
[78:56.65]Oh.
[78:57.51]These aren't frogs, huh?
[79:02.33]Really?
[79:02.97]You don't think these are frogs now?
[79:07.29]Not frogs, huh?
[79:08.17]Not frogs, huh?
[79:32.10]Okay?
[79:32.94]There's three frogs in here.
[79:34.00]And we're gonna have somebody, like, face down, dead, floating.
[79:38.57]No, no.
[79:39.15]No violence.

[80:02.22]No, those are frogs.
[80:05.91]Why are the frogs looking in the sky?
[80:07.07]Because somebody's taking a picture from the sky.
[80:09.15]A helicopter's driving by.
[80:10.31]Somebody's leaning out the window.
[80:14.67]This is like the fucking, like the CDC is like driving by to make sure they take like all the pawns in the country or something.

[81:25.84]It is, right?
[81:26.40]Here are the picnic baskets.

[82:20.74]So people wouldn't know what the fuck this was supposed to be about.
[82:27.85]Just a little bit of blood in the water.
[82:29.23]Just so people understand that it's supposed to be a piece about disease in the water.
[82:39.63]No, it's gonna have a good name.

[108:45.11]What was, like, the dude's name that was, like, the admiral or whatever?
[108:58.60]What am I doing?
[109:01.16]Don't tell him to tone the butt cheeks?
[109:04.28]Ah, that's a good idea.
[109:06.80]I will.
[109:12.87]How would you be sitting like this, by the way?
[109:14.47]I'm just realizing what the fuck I'm doing.
[109:16.51]You can't sit like this.
[109:18.43]It can't be sleeveless either.
[109:20.29]He would get kicked out of his position as admiral.
[109:29.47]We're on four different planes here, by the way.
[109:34.05]Oh, so it was this color, right?
[109:35.51]Yep.
[109:41.61]These will come down to, like, here.
[109:45.41]Sure, it's a little too small for him, but that's alright.
[109:47.46]He rolls his sleeves up and he beats the fuck out of people.
[109:59.43]Okay.
[110:01.03]Just a little bit longer.
[110:01.83]He's gonna have like big cuffs too, right?
[110:03.79]Yeah.

[110:13.78]Where's his body?
[110:14.54]Oh, okay.
[110:14.94]There we go.
[110:16.72]Alright, I think that's good, right?
[110:18.39]Maybe a little bit of touch up?
[110:28.88]Pretty nice cat paws he has here.
[110:42.54]I can't touch it up.
[110:43.18]It's alright.
[110:43.60]Here we go.
[110:44.06]Alright, that looks alright.
[110:51.57]That's okay, guys.
[110:58.76]The nobleman.
[111:02.44]I don't want to sell this one.
[111:03.76]I want to leave this one up.
[111:04.86]Because somebody really important is going to come in and look at it.
[111:07.72]I don't want to sell it.
[111:08.38]I don't care what this guy wants to pay for it.
[111:09.64]This guy's not a noble.
[111:11.30]No, he didn't even want it.
[111:13.12]It's like this guy, smiley looking motherfucker, doesn't want this painting.
[111:16.42]Good.
[111:16.68]Get out of here.
[111:18.20]Get out of my shop.
[111:20.42]Too complex for me.
[111:21.83]Sad.
[111:22.59]Good.
[111:22.89]That means that this guy's fucking brain is too small to understand my immense work.
[111:30.47]She looks like... No, I don't think she's noble.
[111:34.09]Oh, that's so much money though.
[111:40.81]$2,400.
[111:41.35]Is it worth it or should I keep it up there?
[111:42.63]Because that's like the best one I've done.

[112:06.13]We can do another one.
[112:06.99]No, no, I got one.
[112:10.64]Hey, hold on a second.
[112:13.74]Hey.
[112:14.78]I got a little thing for you.
[112:17.32]Hey, what's that?
[112:18.12]What's this?
[112:24.77]Hey.
[112:27.77]Hey.
[112:28.37]Hey, what's this one?
[112:44.36]Look at that.
[112:44.88]I got a polar bear.
[112:45.54]A polar bear blinking in a snowstorm.
[112:46.98]I'm fucking laughing about it a little bit.
[113:08.26]Calvin and Hobbes reference.
[113:09.64]There is my guy right here.
[113:11.12]I usually sell to this guy.
[113:21.42]This one's going to be kind of morbid, but just bear with me here.
[113:28.07]No, don't sell it.
[113:42.10]This one's going to be a period piece, just so you guys are aware.
[114:14.08]This one's gonna be called Global Warming.
[114:33.70]Global Warming 2025.
[114:50.00]And we're gonna have like a little map, just so people know.
[114:52.80]Just so people are aware.
[114:54.42]This is gonna be like a map of California.
[114:57.40]Like a map of the United States.
[114:58.24]So this is the United States right here.
[115:04.73]And like this is where California is supposed to be.
[115:07.67]And like shit is fucking gone.
[115:09.21]You know what I mean?
[115:09.95]Just gone.
[115:12.37]Underwater.
[115:16.29]You know what I'm saying?
[115:16.83]Like, fucking underwater.
[115:17.89]Florida, underwater.
[115:19.13]Massachusetts, underwater.
[115:20.33]And the fucking USA is on fire, too.
[115:28.91]See, this is like... I pulled out a little.
[115:30.91]This is like the... I'm gonna pull out and, like, boom.
[115:34.78]Like, this is... That's, like, the big bird's-eye view of, like, the world.
[115:38.14]You know what I mean?
[115:38.56]Of, like, the United States.
[115:39.62]And this is a little bit closer.
[115:40.54]Global warming to 2025.
[115:51.71]Uh, let's say 2050.
[115:53.50]Nah, it might be like 2075.
[115:54.82]This one is gonna... I will sell this one and get rid of this one.
[116:00.54]This joke one sucks.
[116:07.15]Um...
[116:13.31]This one's gonna be called... I don't understand.
[116:17.38]Well, Dawn, you come in here like often and you just don't get any work at all.
[116:21.64]I don't know why you keep coming into my fucking store.
[116:25.98]That's optimistic.
[116:27.16]Alright, this one's gonna be called... Summer Dream.
[116:32.12]It's gonna be an ice cream cone.
[116:33.38]It's gonna be a beautiful ice cream cone.
[116:36.63]With like a nice dewy background.
[116:39.59]Bad colors.
[116:40.43]Fuck off, George.
[116:54.71]Ooh, you want it, don't you?
[116:55.91]Take it, Mary.
[116:59.23]See, Mary understands global warming.
[117:08.33]You guys aren't even going to understand what this is.
[117:11.17]When you do, I mean, like, you'll know why they call me the fucking art major.
[117:38.48]This one's gonna be good.
[117:42.16]Bang.
[117:43.08]I know my art fucking terminology.
[117:44.62]Ice cream macro.
[117:51.28]Pretty good.
[117:51.64]Two and a half K?
[117:55.75]No, I'm not gonna sell it.
[118:03.05]Lack of complexity, but is it still good?
[118:04.65]Yes.
[118:07.36]I don't understand.
[118:07.96]Let's find out.
[118:09.58]Draw auto.
[118:10.40]Well, thank you, hole1zombie.
[118:12.78]You've given quite a bit of money at this point, so thank you.
[118:18.71]Also, thank you to blah613.
[118:22.21]Holy Mac also gave $2.
[118:23.41]The only photograph of first American president, George Washington.
[118:28.33]Yes, it is.
[118:30.21]He wants the ice cream one.
[118:31.35]$200, Don.
[118:32.51]Get the fuck out of here.
[118:34.60]I'm not selling that for $200.
[118:39.70]Bad colors.
[118:40.28]That's fine.
[118:41.84]Neverchurchpurple also gave $5 again.
[118:44.55]And gave $10.
[118:47.51]Says, shit, I looked.
[118:48.85]What reality do you live in where people look like this?
[118:51.61]A fucking weird one.
[118:53.37]But thanks again, Purple, for the extra $15 on top of your $100 already.
[118:59.92]And then FireAntTV as well.
[119:01.06]Thanks for the bits, guys.
[119:03.14]You guys rock.
[119:05.64]I want to fill my studio here.
[119:06.82]Let's do...
[119:09.87]I'm going to call this one the funeral.
[119:18.82]Yeah.
[119:20.86]The funeral.
[119:23.42]She even went up to 2600.
[119:24.88]No, I fucking should, but no.
[119:30.32]The funeral.
[119:37.50]Yeah.
[119:45.06]No, we need to like... No, it's gotta be dark.
[119:58.03]This is like the hole.
[119:58.77]This is the hole in the ground.
[120:05.05]Let's put a little bit of darker green on the edges so it's like, you know, it's like dug up.
[120:09.65]Can't even do the darker green.
[120:11.69]Oh, fucking well.
[120:13.18]Whatever.
[120:14.17]Okay, there's the hole.
[120:16.83]Why does Dawn keep coming back?
[120:17.99]I don't know.
[120:18.31]Dawn, sure.
[120:19.31]You can have it.
[120:20.78]You really want the ice cream picture.
[120:22.22]The businessmen are beginning to recognize my potential.
[120:25.74]Didn't know this was a creative stream.
[120:31.36]Yeah, well, sometimes we do a creative stream.
[120:34.87]Alright, so this... The sky is going to be a little dreary.
[120:38.67]Just a little.
[120:39.17]Just a little.
[120:40.61]Just a little.
[120:42.65]It's not that dreary, but it's okay.
[120:47.12]Put some trees back here.
[120:48.10]This is going to be very detailed.
[120:52.24]No.
[120:53.02]I think I really should just do this.
[120:54.36]I'm going to sell that and it's going to be the next level.
[120:56.26]Because that's a lot of money.
[121:00.66]Tree back here.
[121:01.36]A couple of trees.
[121:17.99]Okay, that's all I need.
[121:20.09]Easiest way to make a tree, guys, is just do this.
[121:23.92]Grab a spray paint tool.
[121:27.54]And just, like, make, like, fucking wig hair.
[121:32.28]Easiest way to make a tree.
[121:34.38]There's your tip. 2600.
[121:45.22]Forgot to color this in.
[121:46.30]Shit.
[121:52.18]I think I'm gonna sell it.
[121:53.57]No.
[121:56.03]Can't.
[121:56.27]Not yet.
[121:56.55]Let's go with this one.
[122:03.97]Sell?
[122:04.41]Sell?
[122:04.85]I want... No, that's the best painting I've made.
[122:06.63]That has to be here when the noble comes in.
[122:11.04]I made that specifically for him.
[122:15.19]Okay, so they've got the trees there.
[122:18.17]Let's draw the priest as a priest, right?
[122:20.01]First we have to have the coffin in there.
[122:22.75]Alright, there we go.
[122:33.40]We're not making any jokes on this one.
[122:34.88]This is literally just like the funeral.
[122:38.63]I'm not going to make any jokes and bad taste.
[122:41.19]This is just a depiction of death in modern America.
[122:46.79]You know?
[122:47.11]This is just a depiction.
[122:51.83]No, we're not going to make any fucking jokes or anything.
[122:58.65]I need a gravestone.
[123:11.09]Social media replacing parenting?
[123:12.59]Social media says no.
[123:19.00]Man.
[123:19.36]Alright, there's text on this.
[123:21.92]It's just... Okay.
[123:33.20]I'm going to have some family members around.
[123:35.58]What should it say on the casket?
[123:37.39]It usually has something on it, right?
[123:40.58]No, that's fine.
[123:51.66]Is that a goose?
[123:55.29]Okay, you have to have people standing around.
[123:57.95]They have to be all dressed in black.
[124:03.37]And they all have their hands out and pray.
[124:15.25]Okay, they got this that there's like the family
[124:48.51]I don't want you to buy this.
[124:53.15]And then, of course... Of course!
[124:57.60]Of course you have the dinosaur pastor.
[125:11.02]He's standing behind here.
[125:24.97]Joke.
[125:29.15]They have like this thing, right?
[125:33.32]Is this a joke?
[125:36.20]Hold on.
[125:38.36]See, if you guys don't understand, this is a dinosaur funeral.
[125:52.74]Okay, and then his tail, he's got like a big ass tail.
[125:55.20]See, he's like facing this way, so the tail's gonna be up here.
[125:57.70]Get out of here, George.
[126:01.05]Wrong color.
[126:01.93]Right.
[126:09.29]See, this is like, it's going backwards.
[126:16.76]Blah, blah.
[126:26.44]He's pretty much like lying down to do this.
[126:28.02]This is his tail.
[126:35.08]We're going to put a little bit of detail work on the tail.
[126:36.80]Don't worry.
[126:37.16]I got you guys.
[126:37.81]This just looks like a sock.
[126:44.55]Don't worry.
[126:51.41]I'm going to fix that.
[126:52.07]I'll fix it.
[126:52.53]Don't worry.
[126:53.98]How many times have I said don't worry?
[127:11.28]I'm saving the other painting because that's like a good painting.
[127:15.50]It's people that want to drop like two, three thousand dollars on it, so I don't want to sell it.
[127:19.10]I want it to be the one that's there when the VIP comes in.
[127:32.11]I'll sell this one.
[127:43.88]Okay, he needs to have some teeth.
[127:45.00]There we go.
[127:59.59]There we are.
[128:00.45]There he is.
[128:00.97]There's the pastor dinosaur.
[128:02.25]I'm going to have the sun up there too for detail.
[128:10.24]See, this is nice.
[128:15.08]A little bit more detailed work on him.
[128:16.34]Let's make him like really pop.
[128:17.42]Do you know what I mean?
[128:23.55]Looks like he has hair.
[128:25.41]Fuck.
[128:39.16]Almost.
[128:44.28]I'm not selling that fucking painting.
[128:46.16]Please leave me alone about it.
[128:57.63]They're praying over mud.
[128:59.47]No, there's a casket in there.
[129:09.20]Do they have hats in funerals?
[129:12.20]Do they?
[129:13.99]Do you wear like a hat if you're like a pastor?
[129:17.01]Do you?
[129:17.69]No.
[129:18.69]No, you don't.
[129:19.09]He wouldn't.
[129:19.37]He's a fucking T-Rex.
[129:20.25]He wouldn't be wearing one.
[129:39.25]There's his little hands.
[129:42.11]okay looks like he's about to push the gravestone in I know this is just this is just like t-rex grave vandal it looks like he's about to fucking everyone's looking up at him like he doesn't belong look at these eyes they're looking up at him like this guy doesn't belong and he's about to shove the tombstone in there this is just like vandal t-rex at a funeral
[130:12.36]Okay, that's it.
[130:13.60]Okay, that was good.
[130:14.53]I'm gonna have a little bit of blood in his teeth just so they know he's a fucking vicious T-Rex, but he's just here.
[130:19.83]He's here to pay his respects to whoever's in the ground.
[130:24.96]Okay, good.
[130:39.59]I... Funeral Randall?
[130:42.54]Funeral Vandal.
[130:47.94]Funeral... Oh, god damn it.
[130:53.06]Funeral Randall Rex.
[130:58.04]Funeral Vandal Randall Rex.
[131:04.05]Funeral Vandal Randall Rex.
[131:07.29]No, Randall Rex Funeral Vandal.
[131:10.45]Yeah, Funeral Vandal, Randall T-Rex.
[131:16.72]Randall the Vandal.
[131:20.06]Randall the Funeral Vandal T-Rex.
[131:27.60]I like that.
[131:38.85]That's his quote, you know what I mean?
[131:40.95]He's Randall T-Rex, but he's Randall the Funeral Vandal T-Rex.
[131:46.58]There you go.
[131:47.76]This one's gonna be good.
[131:53.20]If this is a Jerma Rumble character, he would have to be in it.
[131:55.53]I would agree.
[131:57.73]There you go.
[131:59.29]There it is.
[131:59.85]Hopefully somebody buys that painting.
[132:06.74]See how much I've improved with my shitty paint?
[132:08.50]2300.
[132:09.78]No, we're going to pass right now.
[132:12.84]That was the first bid.
[132:18.31]One day the noble will come.
[132:19.63]Someday.
[132:22.73]Higher than 25.
[132:23.63]18.
[132:24.91]No, George, your pockets are not deep enough.
[132:27.58]You've been getting outbid the entire time.
[132:32.95]Dude, this game fucking sucks.
[132:34.67]No, it's charming.
[132:35.97]I like this game.
[132:37.85]You're right, I'm not signing my paintings.
[132:41.17]Somebody just made a very good point.
[132:42.39]I'm not signing these paintings.
[132:43.70]Somebody could just buy this and sign their name on it.
[132:46.32]And it's their painting.
[132:48.90]Fuck, I gotta start doing that.
[132:52.21]What do you mean this game's not good?
[132:54.41]This game took, like, drawing shitty mouse MS Paint drawings and made it a game.
[132:59.79]And it's funny.
[133:00.59]I think it's fun.
[133:01.75]This is the game.
[133:02.39]It's fucking just... What is this, like, fucking eight bucks?
[133:08.23]Like, this game is more fun than, like, any game I've played in the last, like, two weeks.
[133:12.27]I mean, like, PUBG was bizarre, right?
[133:13.91]But, like, I mean, come on.
[133:14.93]This is... This game's fun.
[133:18.53]Alright.
[133:23.17]Has he made a dick yet?
[133:24.13]No, that's so... That's cheap.
[133:26.05]We don't do cheap... No cheap jokes.
[133:29.29]I could easily draw, like, a penis, like, peeing.
[133:32.09]But I'm not gonna do that.
[133:32.87]That's a cheap joke, and plus I might get in trouble for that, because twitch.tv may not appreciate me making, like, penis references on the screen.
[133:40.48]So, no.
[133:41.84]Sorry, guys.
[133:42.24]It's cheap.
[133:46.00]Alright.
[133:48.66]TV drama about a horse actor receives general... A horse actor...
[133:52.22]I'm not drawing any more horses.
[133:53.22]No more horses.
[133:56.52]What can I do next?
[134:00.92]How about... Let's do like... How about like a candle?
[134:09.67]A bedroom set.
[134:11.39]Hold on.
[134:12.19]Wait.
[134:12.93]23.
[134:13.07]Fuck off.
[134:13.65]It's gotta be like 24.
[134:14.09]Like a cozy bedroom.
[134:17.95]26. 26.
[134:23.79]Draw Batboy.
[134:24.79]Okay, if somebody wanted me to draw Otto, I can do that.
[134:26.27]That's fine.
[134:26.65]We'll draw Otto, like, playing in the grass.
[134:32.66]Otto's easy.
[134:33.24]This will sell because people will fucking... This painting's gonna sell because people just love dogs for some reason.
[134:38.50]If you show a dog on camera, you get, like, money.
[134:40.88]Like, it doesn't make any sense.
[134:42.34]Why?
[134:43.60]Like, watch this.
[134:44.82]I'm going to draw a picture of Otto, and somebody here's gonna pay, like, over $1,000 for it.
[134:51.33]So Otto is, he's a black dog, so he's going to be looking towards the camera.
[134:58.34]There's his eyes.
[135:12.40]Small, there's Otto.
[135:17.65]He's got like a brown face here.
[135:22.24]Got a little bit of brown here.
[135:25.87]Okay.
[135:35.99]I need the pen for this one.
[135:41.97]We're doing finesse work.
[135:42.79]I wish I could zoom in.
[135:43.59]That's the only thing you can't do.
[135:44.61]2,600?
[135:46.17]No.
[135:51.00]Something's telling me I probably should just sell this soon.
[135:57.36]Looks like a mushroom.
[135:59.21]$2,300.
[135:59.31]I gotta sell it.
[136:00.87]$2,300.
[136:01.11]I'll take it.
[136:01.55]I need to sell a painting.
[136:02.43]And no one's gone any higher than that.
[136:07.15]I had to do it.
[136:10.29]I need money.
[136:17.38]Well, you know, I can do the eyes later.
[136:18.78]Just color this in.
[136:26.97]Okay, there we go.
[136:27.85]A little bit of extra brown there.
[136:33.59]Make the eyes.
[136:41.57]Mm-hmm.
[136:44.48]Auto.
[136:45.90]Auto.
[136:48.02]There we go.
[136:48.58]Now he's going to be looking over here.
[136:52.54]Should be good.
[136:53.60]His little bum.
[136:58.29]One of his paws.
[136:59.27]We'll just come up with a reference right here.
[137:00.77]He is like a... $3,000.
[137:06.25]$3,000. $3,000.
[137:26.14]No.
[137:27.19]That means someone will go higher.
[137:28.19]One little paw.
[137:35.51]Another little paw coming down here like this.
[137:39.44]Back legs.
[137:43.06]And this one, he kind of looks like a sheep.
[137:46.70]But my dog, he looks like a sheep anyways.
[137:48.54]He really does.
[137:50.78]He looks like a little sheep dog.
[137:52.89]He's a big bum.
[137:53.51]That's fine.
[138:04.48]No, I'm not gonna sell.
[138:05.92]You know, I assume it's probably 10 grand.
[138:09.98]I have to probably get up to $10,000 before the guy comes in and critiques my stuff.
[138:17.80]Now, Otto has, like, brown feet.
[138:25.11]He's got, like, brown paws.
[138:34.59]There we go.
[138:36.07]This guy has, like, chicken feet.
[138:38.35]It's okay.
[138:38.89]He has, like, big bird feet from Sesame Street, but don't worry.
[138:42.63]I keep saying don't worry.
[138:44.21]It's the name of the stream.
[138:46.75]So, hey, Holy Mac, you want to make, like, a video of this?
[138:50.17]Just title it, like, Passaporte-Don't Worry.
[138:55.50]The name of this game.
[138:56.08]This name is Don't Worry.
[138:57.66]That's all you need to do.
[138:59.86]Say that a thousand times.
[139:01.98]He's got a little bit of brown back here, a little dusting of brown, like here or there.
[139:05.38]A little bit of brown on his back.
[139:09.72]We'll spray it on there to make it better.
[139:11.26]Make it a little bit cleaner looking.
[139:17.75]Ooh, fashionable shoes for dogs.
[139:19.93]Fashionable shoes for dogs, right?
[139:21.51]Um... Shit, Otto doesn't wear shoes, but it's okay.
[139:24.81]We're gonna be in, like, big blue, like, Sonic the Hedgehog shoes.
[139:40.46]You know I had to do this.
[139:44.62]I'm gonna name it, like, Dog Shoes.
[139:52.27]Those social media things that pop up, do they honestly even mean anything, or is it just one of those stupid things that games do sometimes?
[139:58.37]Where it gives you funny little news tidbits that don't matter at all.
[140:01.41]Is that what's going on?
[140:09.29]Now they're all up at 3,000.
[140:09.91]That's fine.
[140:10.43]I'm just going to put some birds in the sky.
[140:15.38]And that'll be fine.
[140:18.66]Okay.
[140:20.98]I need some little laces.
[140:22.62]Okay.
[140:28.78]Those are fashionable shoes.
[140:30.70]Get a couple of birds out here.
[140:42.98]That's- Don't you guys remember how to make birds be- Hold on.
[140:45.62]Shut up.
[140:46.52]Everybody shut up for a second.
[140:48.00]Don't fucking say anything.
[140:49.07]I did it wrong.
[140:49.57]I'm gonna have a nicer sky, too.
[141:09.35]You guys know how they make a bird.
[141:10.93]It's hard because I don't have control.
[141:20.46]These are like birds in the distance.
[141:22.66]I learned this when I was in like the fucking fourth grade.
[141:29.18]See?
[141:33.69]That's good enough.
[141:43.96]Dog shoes are in.
[141:45.32]Somebody buy it.
[141:51.32]Painted by a delinquent.
[141:53.22]What are you talking about?
[141:54.36]Get out of here.
[141:56.54]Thin clouds.
[141:57.18]No, they're birds.
[142:01.06]I didn't sign it.
[142:05.21]Shit.
[142:06.19]God damn it.
[142:11.49]Why?
[142:12.15]Oh my god!
[142:13.33]2,500 bucks!
[142:16.67]Sold.
[142:16.97]I don't know if I get that opportunity again.
[142:22.83]Alright, but we have to be getting close.
[142:25.26]To, like, the VIP.
[142:26.52]How much money do I have?
[142:27.18]8,700 bucks?
[142:28.44]Let's see.
[142:28.82]What do my bills look like?
[142:38.11]$8,700.
[142:38.13]I probably have to get $10,000.
[142:41.93]I denied $3,000.
[142:42.87]None on that one.
[142:48.02]Alright, let's do... Someone offered $29,000 for the dog?
[142:56.15]No, they didn't.
[143:02.27]Let's do a nice close-up of a bottle of wine.
[143:06.76]I like that idea.
[143:08.26]So if we're going to do a close-up, that means it's going to be a lot of depth of field.
[143:11.27]So the background's going to be blurry.
[143:15.21]And we're going to be using a nice telephoto lens, so it's going to look very, very much right in the forefront.
[143:21.85]Judging by the rule of thirds in photography and videography, we're going to have the base be here, coming up into the top right there.
[143:29.28]So we'll go with a nice clean, I'd say like dark purple.
[143:34.24]Come up with it like here.
[143:35.55]What's that?
[143:40.55]Okay.
[143:40.87]Call that in.
[143:46.68]I'm going to change this label a little.
[143:48.16]Don't you worry about that.
[143:49.16]Get that nice and clean.
[143:52.59]Nobody cares about you buying that.
[143:57.97]Let's get the label on there.
[144:04.40]Let's make the label gray.
[144:07.26]Here.
[144:12.11]Here.
[144:15.35]That's a really nice depth of field look.
[144:16.83]I like it a lot.
[144:17.66]Looks really great.
[144:18.40]I'm going to have the whole thing to be this color though.
[144:22.32]I'm going to layer it around.
[144:34.42]Very nice effect there.
[144:35.78]I really like it.
[144:36.74]Should we get the top here?
[144:38.18]Without the top, it's just a label we're concerned about.
[144:40.90]It has to be the writing on the label.
[144:43.02]Let's get a nice tree on here.
[144:44.80]A nice wispy tree that shows that we're from wine country, or like a willow tree.
[144:50.66]It's going to be called Willow Tree Wine.
[144:53.24]It's going to be very abstract.
[144:54.66]It's going to be very... Let's take this...
[145:09.37]Willow Tree Wine.
[145:46.44]Look at that fucking artistic integrity going right up in the tree.
[145:49.48]It's the base of the tree.
[146:02.72]And we're only seeing a small part of that label.
[146:05.36]So see, it's gonna keep going that way.
[146:21.65]eat my asshole god damn it hold on this wine fuck this wine is fucking 1721 that's the year
[146:47.32]Get a little bit more.
[146:48.14]We've got to clean this up a little bit here.
[146:49.84]We've got to get one of these blues to really show the label.
[147:01.24]One more up there.
[147:01.98]One down here too.
[147:16.08]Okay, then up here is going to be... We'll show a little bit more of this blue up here.
[147:21.96]So you know that's where we're getting to the top of that wine bottle.
[147:24.50]Got a nice depth of field look over here.
[147:25.63]Got a nice depth of field on this table here.
[147:27.77]Speaking of tables.
[147:30.37]Cut right there.
[147:33.23]Like this is the... It's okay.
[147:39.51]See, look at this.
[147:41.33]I'm going to put a fucking box of apples on this table behind it.
[147:45.83]So it's like, damn, you're close.
[147:47.31]But you're still getting everything.
[147:48.17]You're on telephoto.
[147:49.47]We're getting two different things here.
[148:06.92]So right, this is the very front of the table.
[148:10.00]Bag of apples.
[148:10.84]Right here.
[148:11.26]Look at this.
[148:11.94]Check this out.
[148:21.97]Easy.
[148:28.91]Easy.
[148:36.74]Fucking fruit salad.
[148:46.65]I'm going to define this.
[148:47.37]Don't worry, don't worry.
[148:48.07]I'm going to define it.
[148:52.24]And then... Let's get some definition on these apples.
[148:55.12]I don't know.
[149:04.69]Fuck it.
[149:04.99]There's bugs in it.
[149:05.55]Who cares?
[149:13.62]And I think that's perfect.
[149:14.84]Maybe put a tablecloth down too?
[149:15.98]Yeah.
[149:16.96]One tablecloth like right here.
[149:18.38]Okay.
[149:34.82]I like it.
[149:35.84]Except I kind of want it to be this color.
[149:52.18]I like it.
[149:53.20]Fork and knife, too.
[149:54.40]Fork and knife.
[150:00.44]What side does it go on, right?
[150:02.25]What side?
[150:02.59]The knife goes on the left.
[150:03.49]No, no, no.
[150:03.97]Knife goes on the right.
[150:04.63]Spoon goes on the left.
[150:09.25]You got spoon and fork that go... Knife is on the other side.
[150:17.62]Spoon and fork.
[150:25.42]And the plate is right in the middle.
[150:35.75]And on the plate there's gonna be a fucking steak.
[150:50.01]Beautiful.
[150:50.35]And some greens too.
[150:53.22]I'm getting hungry.
[150:53.78]I need a wine glass.
[150:57.44]Of course I do.
[151:00.58]Wine glass right over the neck.
[151:02.08]I'm so excited.
[151:03.18]This is such a good fucking painting.
[151:04.34]It really is.
[151:04.74]This is perfect.
[151:07.90]Wine glass is going to be right here.
[151:13.97]With a little bit of that vintage in there.
[151:15.27]You know what I'm saying?
[151:26.10]Oh, it's perfect.
[151:28.22]It's perfect.
[151:36.20]It's perfect.
[151:39.76]Is that a glass for ants?
[151:40.80]We're doing perspective here.
[151:41.94]See, the background is all blurred out.
[151:44.04]We're doing perspective.
[151:44.88]Alright, now I gotta sign it.
[151:53.37]God damn it!
[151:53.97]This is too big!
[152:14.28]Fourteen hundred dollars!

[153:31.09]Thank you, Otzel, for the bits.
[153:33.63]Also, Iconoclasm.
[153:36.05]How many times has Don walked into your studio, looked at the one painting, and said, I don't understand.
[153:40.32]Why does he keep doing that?
[153:42.90]Yeah, Don, by the time, I figure you've been in here so many times, like, you've probably figured out that you don't get it, so stop coming in here.
[153:49.48]You have to, he's spending money.
[153:52.17]Don keeps coming in here and driving here with gas in his car.
[153:58.51]He spends like, fuck, this guy probably spends like a hundred bucks a week to come here and not understand this one painting.
[154:06.02]Alright, uh, should I make Don, okay, I'm gonna make Don a simple painting, you're right.
[154:12.25]We'll make it abstract, we'll make it colorful for Don's tiny fucking brain.
[154:18.57]Look, here we go.
[154:20.60]I call this one... Cotton Candy Swirl.
[154:23.70]I call this one Cotton Candy Swirl.
[155:01.81]There you go, Don.
[155:03.45]Cotton candy swirl.
[155:09.99]Wait, carnival crimes?
[155:11.81]There.
[155:30.32]Cotton candy, asshole.
[155:34.82]I can't invest in this much detail.
[155:36.36]I didn't sign... I don't want to sign that one.
[155:39.31]Fuck it.
[155:39.69]That's for Don.
[155:40.43]Don can sign it with his name.
[155:47.37]Will he ever sign his work?
[155:48.43]I did sign my work.
[155:50.75]No, this one can't be sold.
[155:52.31]We need to make sure we can level up and this painting is good.
[155:54.35]Okay, how about...
[156:01.07]I'm going to do a Starry Night Sky.
[156:03.61]You know what?
[156:05.31]I'm going to try to replicate it.
[156:07.39]I'm going to open up Starry Night.
[156:08.85]We're going to do a Starry Night from Vincent Van Gogh.
[156:12.61]Give me a second.
[156:13.03]I want to look it up.
[156:13.49]I'm going to try to replicate it.
[156:16.54]Starry Night.
[156:19.46]From Vincent Van Gogh.
[156:23.46]I'm going to try to copy it word for word.
[156:24.88]Let's get it on my other screen here.
[156:32.61]And then guess what, motherfuckers?
[156:34.43]I'm gonna sign it.
[156:35.29]I'm gonna sign this thing.
[156:41.71]Alright, let's go.
[156:42.27]A starry night.
[156:44.77]Can I do it?
[156:47.63]So it looks like it's done.
[156:48.55]This is all fucked up, but whatever.
[156:50.01]It starts off with blue up here.
[156:52.97]This color blue is up here.
[157:01.58]Starts like that, and then... This fills out down here.
[157:17.63]And then it kind of does the same thing, like, here.
[157:23.94]And then there's, like, the fucking, like, Hogwarts is, like, on the left.
[157:31.44]I need the other one.
[157:33.48]And it, like, curls.
[157:46.73]Okay.
[157:52.48]And that comes over here.
[157:53.94]This, like, does the same thing.
[158:04.93]Okay.
[158:05.97]Don's in here?
[158:06.71]Don doesn't like it.
[158:08.77]Okay.
[158:09.07]Well, Don, your brain is fucking puny.
[158:11.57]And that comes across.
[158:12.67]This also goes up here like that.
[158:14.41]I need the darker one to go up here.
[158:27.51]This.
[158:28.41]Okay.
[158:31.85]Get out of here.
[158:35.11]The rest is what's going to put this here as a placeholder.
[158:42.68]And so this trails off a little bit more, too.
[158:45.20]It goes like that.
[158:52.81]Okay.
[158:53.45]So now we do Hogwarts.
[158:59.19]Hogwarts.
[159:01.25]Hogwarts is like a black castle looking thing.
[159:03.39]It comes up like this is one side.
[159:05.31]It starts like here.
[159:12.72]Spike.
[159:13.18]And it comes up to like another like spike.
[159:16.40]Which goes like up to like a tower.
[159:18.04]Like that.
[159:22.94]Goes like this.
[159:24.24]And there's like another little flame thing that's like right here.
[159:30.36]Like that.
[159:32.40]Okay, let's fill this in.
[159:39.46]There's brown in here too, I'll get it, don't worry.
[159:41.92]Don't worry!
[159:42.60]Up here.
[160:02.06]It's getting it looks pretty close guys.
[160:04.06]I'm sorry to say this but like This shit is real close, and I'm not even I'm not even done And then there's like a cut there's like some towns over here, right?
[160:24.46]So we need to do some buildings is that they're like a very they're like a blue down here I
[160:30.93]They're like houses.
[160:31.67]I'm gonna clean this up.
[160:36.19]Don't fret.
[160:39.51]There's like some green grass over here.
[160:42.40]Dark green.
[160:45.52]Whatever.
[160:45.90]Who gives a fuck?
[160:47.10]This painting sucks, by the way.
[160:49.74]Like, what a shitty painting.
[160:53.04]What is a star knight even?
[160:54.20]What is this?
[160:54.94]What is this?

[161:24.81]Looks good looking good so far.
[161:26.05]Oh
[161:28.72]Maybe a little bit of brown in here, a little bit of brown and maroon.
[161:30.55]We're going to do some shrieking.
[161:33.33]So that comes up like in little flames, a little bit like... Like that.
[161:48.60]I mean, like, I can't look... I'm doing what I can work with, okay?
[161:52.20]I'm using what I can work with.

[161:58.00]So, sorry.
[161:59.66]Sorry, guys.
[162:03.13]There's a little red house down here.
[162:04.67]Make sure we get that in there.
[162:07.65]Okay, now we gotta do the most important shit, which is the starry night.
[162:14.02]The star is in the starry night.
[162:15.86]So, let's get the moon.
[162:17.18]The moon is over here.
[162:19.24]It's just, like, right here.

[162:43.30]So let's go.
[162:43.86]Look, it's like a white plasma.
[162:45.82]Kind of like a peach plasma.
[162:47.04]So let's go like right there.
[162:52.19]No, fucking dickhead.
[162:54.37]You dickhead game.
[162:55.99]That's my fault.
[162:56.55]Stop thinking about it.

[164:05.93]There's one right in here.
[164:08.63]One here.
[164:09.21]Right next to this.
[164:11.52]One right here.
[164:12.48]One right here.
[164:13.92]Two to the left.
[164:14.98]And that one, one, two right here.
[164:38.08]And then it's too close.
[164:41.00]I don't have a fucking landscape canvas.
[164:42.98]So whatever.
[164:43.44]We're going to put one more here and one more here.
[164:46.95]And then we do a couple of circles, some red.
[164:53.05]And these little ones, they kind of just go in the middle like this.
[164:59.93]This one's a little bigger for some reason.
[165:01.53]Don't ask me why.
[165:06.94]Okay, this one's a little bigger too.
[165:11.98]This one's small.
[165:14.02]Okay, this is one last one in here.
[165:26.19]And that's it.
[165:29.25]Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching this wonderful paint stream.
[165:35.97]There's a Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh.
[165:40.37]They accept, except it's by me, because I'm signing it.
[165:43.54]Down here.
[165:43.90]Let's go with, like... There.
[165:51.70]This is not even my signature.
[165:52.66]I gotta, like... My signature's way cooler than this.
[165:55.28]I'm just doing a shitty one.
[165:56.62]My signature's not this shitty.
[165:57.82]It's cool.
[165:58.40]I have, like, a very beautiful signature.
[166:01.65]I'm just doing it for, like, a joke.
[166:03.87]The last two signings was shitty, and I could do much better.
[166:07.03]But that, don't, that, my signature's way prettier than that.
[166:10.82]And it's done.
[166:14.02]It's pretty, that's pretty good.
[166:30.21]Here we go.
[166:30.79]Starry Night.
[166:35.18]No one understands something this complex.
[166:36.90]You don't understand a fucking Starry Night.
[166:41.44]That one looks good.
[166:43.12]That one looks good.
[166:44.24]Don't tell me that that one doesn't look good.
[166:45.46]That's probably the best one I've done.
[166:46.69]With my... Up against the clock.
[166:50.67]2600.
[166:50.71]Henceforth, this is my favorite artist.
[166:53.21]No.
[166:54.09]You can do better than that.
[166:54.85]At least it's worth it.
[166:55.47]I know it's worth money.
[166:57.11]No one's gonna buy the candy can thing.
[166:58.55]So I'm gonna just delete it.
[166:59.44]So, like... Fuck it.

[167:34.66]Like, whatever.
[167:37.00]Doesn't even matter.

[167:48.37]For, like, 40 bucks.
[167:58.13]There.

[206:14.79]Should I just keep drawing American flags?
[206:20.45]I feel like that's going to work.
[206:23.78]Honestly, I really do.
[206:24.98]We're going to do it.
[206:26.86]We're just going to draw another American flag.
[206:29.52]This time with slightly different colors.
[206:34.04]I don't even care how sloppy it looks either.
[206:36.18]Who gives a shit?
[206:36.90]It's going to work.
[206:41.20]This is the American flag that was, like, in the dryer for too long.
[206:44.35]Its colors have faded a little.

[214:27.98]Guys, we're talking about... Look.
[214:31.28]Alright good this guy wants this flag alright, so this is this canvas is not landscape So I'm doing it as if it's landscape so when it said you're turning it to the right you're essentially you're flipping it over You know I mean like you look at it landscape like tilt your head to the left.
[214:48.01]That's what it looks like There's no flag is like a piece of fucking knot like 8 by 11 You know I mean it's not like a fucking like piece of paper like an 8 by 10 piece of sheet of paper I
[215:02.32]South Africa?

[215:11.73]No, I can't.
[215:12.53]No, I have no idea.
[215:13.63]There's no way I'm going to know.
[215:17.81]Wait, Nepal is vertical?

[215:24.88]Flags go horizontal.
[215:30.62]Whoa.
[215:32.22]Alright, so I can't do this like this.
[215:34.36]I'll try.
[215:34.70]So it's white.
[215:41.32]It goes like this.
[215:44.61]So... Jesus, man.
[215:50.97]So it's like a bird mouth.
[215:53.03]Like this.
[215:58.89]It's red in the middle.
[216:04.12]Remember, flip it.
[216:05.58]Look at it horizontal, not vertical.
[216:23.75]Okay.
[216:24.25]Fuck.
[216:24.59]Alright.
[216:26.69]There's little symbols too.
[216:28.37]There's like a circle with like
[216:34.11]No, that's the wrong one.
[216:36.35]I'm doing this wrong.
[216:40.03]It's upside down.
[216:40.75]That's okay.
[216:41.75]Whatever.
[216:42.05]So this looks like this.
[216:43.18]I don't care.
[216:47.62]We're doing it.
[216:53.34]Alright.
[216:53.70]I'm like... What?
[216:55.34]Hold on.
[217:00.64]What happened?
[217:02.18]50 years later?
[217:09.93]Money talks.
[217:14.48]That was Passaportats Bato.
[217:17.40]I'm dead?
[217:17.86]It used my not-British flag?
[217:25.46]These are the worst paintings I made the whole time.
[217:27.84]Where's the dinosaur fucking vandal?
[217:30.14]Where's... It's so huge.
[217:34.36]Tremendous.
[217:35.28]Why is this like a Donald Trump game?
[217:40.72]Making art for clients.
[217:41.80]They picked this one.
[217:44.11]Look it.
[217:46.93]These two should not be here.
[217:48.91]Obviously, I understand.
[217:49.55]This is my spread.
[217:51.69]This is Otto.
[217:52.25]That deserves to be here.
[217:53.83]Dead Santa with the UN deserves to be here.
[217:56.82]Where's Walter sucks.
[218:02.16]These are the worst paintings I've made besides one or two of these.
[218:08.21]Did I actually get the bad ending?
[218:09.51]Did I die and not make enough art?
[218:12.39]I don't get it.
[218:12.83]Okay, I thought I drew that.
[218:21.23]See, he signs it.
[218:22.17]This guy signs.
[218:24.47]Okay, do they all sign?
[218:26.53]Don't tell me they all signed it.
[218:27.71]Oh god, they did, didn't they?
[218:30.26]None of these paintings have signatures, by the way.
[218:33.34]Don't sign yours.
[218:34.76]Fuck.
[218:42.08]Dammit, they all did sign it.
[218:49.13]Shit.
[218:51.11]One person's going to have forgotten and not done it.
[218:54.67]I beat the game.
[218:55.25]I win.
[218:55.61]I did art until I died.
[219:00.05]Thank you for playing Passapartote.
[219:01.91]Keep on painting.
[219:07.59]This is cute.
[219:08.64]This is cute.
[219:10.25]I'm going to stop stamping the recommendation on this one.
[219:12.46]I am.
[219:16.68]Is there any, like, after credits scene or whatever?
[219:19.32]A lot of French people apparently liked my work.
[219:23.08]I don't see any of the other guys.
[219:24.95]Can I go anywhere?
[219:26.51]Okay.
[219:28.35]Continue.
[219:35.07]Close this.
[219:36.05]Alright, well, that's a good place to end, I think.
[219:40.13]These are all your customers.
[219:41.68]Oh!
[219:42.90]So I was mostly French.
[219:46.16]Mostly French customers, a couple of, like, wig ladies.
[219:48.44]I don't remember this guy.
[219:49.62]Who's this, like, weird weirdo?
[219:55.07]I do not remember that guy being in here.
[219:57.81]I do want to check one thing, because I want to make sure I give the wholehearted stamp of approval to this game.
[220:04.13]Give me one sec.
[220:06.67]I gotta open up Steam.
[220:11.42]Alright, we've been going for about four hours.
[220:17.00]I think that's a pretty good stopping point, but I do say George doesn't care.
[220:21.97]George never cares.
[220:24.53]Why can I not... I have to close this for a second.
[220:27.67]Hold on.
[220:28.97]So I can open Steam back up.
[220:32.82]Alright.
[220:35.82]So this game currently...
[220:40.15]is on Steam right now.
[220:42.61]For... $8.50.
[220:46.01]Yes.
[220:46.73]I highly recommend this game.
[220:48.60]Sit around with your friends, draw, do paint shit.
[220:52.12]It's fun.
[220:52.84]That was a cute little experience.
[220:54.02]Like a four-hour game.
[220:55.02]Like three to four hours.
[220:57.20]If we didn't just draw flags for like 35 minutes, then it probably would have been like another hour or so.
[221:02.03]But for less than $10, that was a fun, cute little experience.
[221:07.21]Recommend.
[221:07.83]For sure.
[221:11.12]And yeah.
[221:12.68]Off paint with your friends.
[221:13.88]I never said that.
[221:14.46]I did not say that.
[221:16.18]I said paint with your friends.
[221:18.16]Do not misquote me.
[221:21.28]But yeah.
[221:21.90]That's going to be it.
[221:23.36]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[221:25.25]Hopefully you enjoyed the stream.
[221:26.29]It was a fun one.
[221:27.17]I had some fun.
[221:29.69]And tomorrow, there's quite a few options for tomorrow and then Sunday I want to do an IRL thing.
[221:35.25]So, take care everybody.
[221:36.95]I don't think there's anything after the credits.
[221:38.49]Let's just exit.
[221:39.35]Let's go to the main menu.
[221:41.93]Just to make sure we're not missing anything after the credits.
[221:48.93]And don't... Okay, the game... New career.
[221:52.41]Okay, yeah.
[221:53.47]So there you go.
[221:53.97]Let's click this button and see what happens.
[221:59.73]Act 3.
[222:00.23]I guess you can just redo the third act, but it's all the same damn thing.
[222:03.42]You just get more money and it's no big deal.
[222:06.18]Or you can just keep going from here, I guess.
[222:08.00]And you can just endlessly play.
[222:10.24]Anybody want to buy?
[222:10.92]Alright.
[222:12.02]So the flag from Nepal is worth $6,000.
[222:15.08]That's the most out of any painting ever.
[222:18.36]Cool.
[222:19.91]Okay.
[222:20.69]That's good to know.
[222:23.01]Thanks everybody for watching.
[222:23.87]I'm going to close out.
[222:26.23]And I'll see you guys soon.
[222:27.73]Much love.
[222:28.15]I'll see you tomorrow.
[222:28.67]I've got some stuff potentially to do tomorrow.
[222:30.60]I've got a...
[222:32.06]We got some stuff to think about.
[222:34.08]A couple of games to play.
[222:36.65]Thanks for watching.
[222:38.33]Take care, everybody.
[222:39.21]See you soon.
[222:39.63]Thanks, everybody, for watching, subscribing.
[222:41.01]I'll give you a little hand out.
[222:42.19]And goodbye.
[222:43.16]Good luck.
[222:44.82]Have the best of your weekend.
[223:16.64]Thank you.
