[00:20.25]Do I seriously have to immediately stop playing this game because of me having to vomit?
[00:24.26]Alright, well let's just get- Oh no.
[00:29.06]No.
[00:33.79]You can't even see everything.
[00:35.15]It's like 2D on 3D.
[00:37.43]Like, I have no depth perception.
[00:38.97]I can't even tell what the... Am I close to this thing, or am I far away from it?
[00:42.79]Let's find out.
[00:44.25]I guess I was pretty close.
[00:45.31]Okay, let's just... Can I jump?
[00:49.25]Oh, okay, I can jump.
[00:50.89]Sick jump.
[00:53.91]What the hell is that?
[00:56.91]What the fuck are those things?
[01:00.90]What are these, like, little... Muppet things?
[01:03.30]These little, like, weevils?
[01:04.24]Can these hurt me?
[01:13.16]Okay, can I jump on them?
[01:16.62]I don't think so.
[01:19.34]Come on, last try.
[01:22.24]Okay.
[01:23.10]It's very evident that I can't do anything with these things.
[01:25.96]These, like, daffy duck green, like, Marvin Martian things.
[01:29.36]Alright, let's just keep going.
[01:32.14]Apparently I touched him again.
[01:39.33]I love how- did you guys hear that?
[01:43.55]Aren't these game designers wonderful?
[01:46.65]Is what that thing just said.
[01:47.81]Aren't these game designers wonderful?
[01:49.59]I think that was a joke.
[01:51.25]That was a pretty good joke.
[01:53.39]Considering this game probably gave horrible nightmares to a bunch of kids.
[02:00.18]That played it.
[02:00.70]I never played this back in the day.
[02:02.02]I don't even know, did this ever even release?
[02:05.07]I don't even remember this being on store shelves.
[02:09.27]Good grab.
[02:09.95]Oh, good animations.
[02:11.07]Can I jump over this wall?
[02:15.58]What are the point of these enemies if they can't move?
[02:18.18]What do- what- I don't- What the fuck was that?!
[02:20.58]He's like spittin' at me like a- like a Jurassic Park spitter!
[02:23.28]Get me outta here.
[02:27.91]Get that spitter away from me!
[02:29.59]Oh, I'm invincible!
[02:39.18]Oh my god.
[02:42.62]How am I supposed to move this?
[02:43.72]Can I grab this rocket?
[02:46.22]Can I even change the camera?
[02:52.27]Is this thing moving very slowly?
[02:54.21]I feel like it is, but I have no perception at all, so I don't even know what's happening.
[02:57.49]I don't even know if anything's even going on.
[02:59.39]If I'm gonna run into this rocket and see what happens.
[03:02.44]What?
[03:07.16]I have one really important question for you guys.
[03:10.20]You don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but I just really need it.
[03:12.21]Need a clip!
[03:14.13]Good clip.
[03:14.51]Need a clip.
[03:15.55]You like that clip?
[03:16.23]Need a clip.
[03:18.72]Hi Gemma, I didn't get the joke.
[03:20.64]Star!
[03:21.18]Hey everybody, Star is in the video!
[03:23.38]Whoa!
[03:24.44]Whoa!
[03:26.79]My parents are yelling down here.
[03:30.93]They think I'm in trouble.
[03:33.19]Hold on a second, this might be funny.
[03:37.07]This could be pretty funny.
[03:40.06]Come on, come down here.
[03:40.94]Aren't you concerned that your son just got in trouble?
[03:52.01]No!
[03:53.97]Game over!
[03:55.11]Fuck you!
[03:55.85]Game over.
[03:57.49]Need a clip?
[03:59.12]Good clip.
[03:59.72]Do you want to continue?
[04:01.54]I kind of have to continue because I need a clip.
[04:03.66]Want to continue?
[04:04.32]Good to continue.
[04:04.94]Good to continue.
[04:05.58]Need to continue?
[04:06.62]Good to continue.
[04:09.16]Oh, I know all the strats.
[04:10.46]You see, now I can speedrun this.
[04:12.22]World record's going to be two minutes and 35 seconds.
[04:16.50]There it is.
[04:17.61]Look at that.
[04:18.35]That's what we call a speedrun.
[04:19.65]See?
[04:20.03]I wanted to do that because I could jump down.
[04:22.81]Speedrun.
[04:23.87]This way.
[04:25.47]Touch that arrow because it gives you an extra one-up.
[04:28.31]Go this way.
[04:29.64]That's my split.
[04:30.92]Alright, I'm 20 minutes ahead of the world record.
[04:33.32]Let's go.
[04:37.14]Okay, Ghost Reign.
[04:37.80]Oh my god, I'm gonna beat the world record.
[04:42.61]Jeremy, are you okay?
[04:45.57]What's happening down there?
[04:47.49]Are you in trouble?
[04:48.47]Are you sick?
[04:50.72]Is the dog okay?
[04:53.48]No, Mom.
[04:54.28]It's okay.
[04:54.82]I'm just playing Bubsy 3D.
[04:57.40]The shittiest game I've ever played.
[04:59.64]Oh, okay.
[05:00.06]Well, I'm glad.
[05:02.32]And is that the Chester Cheeto on the screen?
[05:04.46]No, Mom.
[05:06.02]Chester Cheeto.
[05:07.42]It's Bubsy.
[05:08.53]The lovable Bubsy.
[05:09.57]Oh, I've never seen that cartoon.
[05:10.73]It's not a cartoon, Mom!
[05:13.01]Jeez.
[05:14.79]See what you just made me do, Mom?
[05:19.68]He just appeared!
[05:21.50]That guy just, like, appeared.
[05:22.70]Or I'm an idiot, I'm not sure.
[05:25.06]Well, you should have been care- Mom, you don't have to be a backseat gamer, okay?
[05:27.76]I know what I'm doing.
[05:30.16]See, I have to go this way, I'm still... I'm gonna, like, puke.
[05:37.07]So, those of you that are asking why this video ends up being, like, four or five minutes, it's because I'm out for your sake.
[05:43.99]I don't want you to puke.
[05:45.87]Because, like, I'm gonna puke.
[05:47.47]In fact, I think I already did puke.
[05:49.92]I just, like, cut the video.
[05:50.90]You saw that cut.
[05:52.72]I puked.
[05:53.68]Alright?
[05:54.00]You wanna know the truth?
[05:55.86]I fucking puked!
[05:59.56]Whoa!
[06:00.57]I... Right when I talk about puking...
[06:07.23]Stop doing that and just wait and be patient.
[06:12.19]That thing is making so much noise.
[06:15.45]Can I please just be level one?
[06:17.99]If I complete level one, I'll be happy.
[06:21.28]Just wait it out.
[06:22.10]Wait it, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[06:23.26]Okay, go.
[06:25.30]I think I just beat level one.
[06:28.66]I hope so.
[06:33.49]Nice, like, cutscene.
[06:39.91]Whoa, this is getting wacky.
[06:42.53]Whoa!
[06:44.11]He got squashed.
[06:46.21]Did you see that, guys?
[06:47.41]Bubsy just got squashed.
[06:50.40]Let's move on to level two.
[06:54.88]And by move on to level two, I mean, like, end the video.
