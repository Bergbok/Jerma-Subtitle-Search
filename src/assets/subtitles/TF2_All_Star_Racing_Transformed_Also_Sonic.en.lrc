[00:05.14]Welcome to Sonic All-Star Racers.
[00:07.90]Say goodbye to the Mario Kart franchise because SEGA is here to stay.
[00:12.58]Play as lovable, well-known SEGA characters such as... Uh, not sure who that guy is there.
[00:18.31]Sonic!
[00:19.79]The monkey ball guy.
[00:22.25]Some kind of horrendous thing that I guess they're throwing in a tennis spin-off too, sure.
[00:28.47]Uh, I... Sonic!
[00:32.02]Nah, it's cool though, because they've got Team Fortress 2 characters in the game.
[00:36.16]They got the heavy, ride-in-the-boat thing.
[00:39.32]Blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah
[01:02.54]I keep getting this feeling, though, like there's something a little bit off with these characters.
[01:09.61]That doesn't sound like the Pyro, but he mumbles, so I'm gonna give him another shot here.
[01:22.75]I do not even remember Wreck-It Ralph having a mother.
[01:26.69]The main thing I don't understand here is you pay all the money in licensing to get these characters in your game, and then you decide to voice act them yourself or something?
[01:35.00]I don't get it.
[01:49.96]I call this move the back burner.
[01:53.90]Meat shot.
[01:54.66]The football manager.
[01:56.12]His license plate is Minforger.
[01:58.50]He has soccer ball tires.
[02:00.53]This guy is balling.
[02:02.77]Literally.
[02:03.27]Get ready.
[02:04.05]I'm ready.
[02:06.01]Three, two, one.
[02:09.12]Soccer ball time.
[02:11.50]Star, that's called football.
[02:13.45]I've just been managing freaking soccer teams all day.
[02:16.65]I'm ready to get out on the field.
[02:18.15]This football guy ain't got no business being this excited about fourth place, alright?
[02:23.57]And he gets fourth place in everything.
[02:25.37]He is fourth place for life.
[02:28.17]THIRD PLACE MOST PLAYED GAME ON STEAM!
[02:30.68]Consistently, too!
[02:32.04]Am I missing something?
[02:33.26]Should I have been playing Football Manager all these years?
[02:35.96]You know, I guess this game does have a pretty good lineup of goofy, cartoony characters.
[02:39.87]That's the guy from Crazy Taxi, and that person... That's... That's Danica Patrick!
[02:45.05]Why is Danica Patrick in this game?
[02:47.17]No, but seriously, think about it.
[02:48.51]Somebody confronted Danica Patrick and was like, you know what?
[02:51.48]You want to be in this game with Football Man Forger, the Shogun guy, Monkey Ball.
[02:56.92]And she said, yes, yes, I want to be in this game.
[02:59.16]That works for me.
[03:00.14]Thank you.
[03:00.90]I am now a licensed SEGA character.
[03:03.10]It's NASCAR star Danica Patrick.
[03:05.83]And that is without even bringing up this commercial.
[03:09.21]This is a real thing.
[03:10.37]Just look at this.
[03:12.97]But you know, she also agreed to the GoDaddy commercials, so, you know, sky's the limit.
[03:29.99]And then in between matches, they give you the choice to gamble coins that you've picked up during races, and if you gamble correctly, you get an advantage over other players.
[03:43.10]There's flying bees now!
[03:45.76]I'm in a jet and I hit a bee, but I caught it with my mitt!
[03:51.55]Come on, Star, stop it!
[03:52.97]That's called a wasp!
[03:54.49]I don't even know how racing games work to begin with, so I can't really judge.
[03:58.17]I'm trying to go through the finish line here, and it's telling me wrong way.
[04:01.29]I just... How is anyone supposed to figure this stuff out?
[04:06.26]The chow spawned!
[04:07.70]Where is it?
[04:08.58]Oh, okay, it's over here.
[04:10.43]Oh, dammit.
[04:11.11]What's a Chao?
[04:12.27]I don't know, it's this little blue guy.
[04:13.89]I'm gonna capture it.
[04:15.95]No you're not, cause I am.
[04:16.81]You!
[04:17.41]What do I do with you?
[04:19.39]Can I take it off your back?
[04:20.77]Oh, I gotta bring him to a spaceship!
[04:23.27]Why is this game amazing?
[04:26.37]No!
[04:27.49]Give me the goddamn Martian!
[04:30.31]You're going away, you would've had it!
[04:32.73]What?
[04:33.29]You have to bring him to the spaceship!
[04:35.25]What spaceship?
[04:35.91]This thing over here?
[04:36.63]No, oh my, you're killing yourself.
[04:39.58]So I played for a while.
[04:40.66]I won a race.
[04:41.30]I got a cheeseburger sticker on my car, which is fantastic.
[04:44.48]I feel accomplished.
[04:45.88]I'm done here.
[04:46.68]Can I, like, zoom the camera out?
[04:47.88]I feel like I'm right up my ass.
[04:49.10]I don't like this.
[04:52.30]No, I'm gonna fall off again.
[04:53.40]I... God, how do I move the camera back?
[04:58.46]I can't even... No, seriously, dude.
[05:01.89]This... I'm so close to the back of this car, it's freaking me out.
[05:06.19]I'm... You won!
[05:08.85]You won!
[05:13.94]Oh, I got hit by something.
[05:21.01]Oh my god!
[05:21.51]Oh, I got hit by something again.
[05:26.41]Why are people just picking on me right now?
[05:34.53]I got an achievement for this!
[05:36.99]I got an achievement!
