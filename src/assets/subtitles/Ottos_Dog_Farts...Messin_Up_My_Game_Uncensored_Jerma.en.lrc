[00:11.59]An ally has been... Oh my god.
[00:14.81]Oh, my dog just farted.
[00:15.91]Oh, this sucks.
[00:18.57]It's horrible, dude.
[00:19.31]I can't even... You're shitting me right now.
[00:22.38]I can't even, like, play the game.
[00:25.98]Be careful, they're right here.
[00:27.44]I can't even... I can't get... Smite's one of those games where you can't leave.
[00:30.14]I can't leave right now.
[00:30.86]I have to, like, accept this for what happened.
[00:34.96]It's not like I can just get up and walk away right now.
[00:39.22]Seriously?
[00:40.46]Man, this is horrendous.
[00:44.42]Oh, God.
[00:45.34]Hold on.
[00:46.82]No, I'm serious, Ry.
[00:47.85]Hold on a second.
[00:49.07]I'm freaking sorry.
[00:51.73]Oh, my God.
[00:55.01]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[00:55.83]Here I come.
[00:57.35]Oh, you guys don't even need my help, do you?
[01:01.77]My ult didn't even grab.
[01:02.87]I got him.
[01:04.84]No, I'm sorry.
[01:06.08]Seriously, alright.
[01:07.72]Alright, go on.
[01:10.22]Shoo.
[01:11.94]Dude, can you imagine if I just like, if you guys both died right there?
[01:16.92]Oh, dragon dragon!
[01:18.22]What?
[01:19.72]Yeah, that was weird.
[01:20.72]I saw that.
[01:21.54]No, that was miles away, but I got hit instantly.
[01:24.22]Yeah, me too.
[01:25.24]What?
[01:26.84]He's going down.
[01:28.32]He's gonna die.
[01:29.38]I don't believe it.
[01:30.08]Oh, he's gonna die.
[01:31.17]Don't worry.
[01:31.61]Don't you worry nothing.
[01:32.91]Don't you worry nothing.
[01:33.77]This dragon is toast.
[01:37.77]No!
[01:37.99]You're toast.
[01:38.59]No!
[01:39.07]I just saw him.
[01:40.15]You're dead.
[01:40.71]You are dead.
[01:41.43]Fucking dog.
[01:48.07]Oh, god damn it.
[01:51.55]If this dog didn't fart in my face, that would not have happened.
[01:55.31]I'm sorry he didn't poop.
[01:57.21]No, he didn't.
[01:57.77]He's right here.
[02:00.00]Have you checked the floor?
[02:01.92]No, there's no... That completely threw my game off.
[02:08.54]We were doing like... Oh, actually, we killed him, but... I was doing well, and then the dog farted in my face, and it was just over.
