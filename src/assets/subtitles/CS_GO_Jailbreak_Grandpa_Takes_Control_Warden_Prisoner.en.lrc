[00:08.30]Okay, so what we're gonna do, you guys, we're gonna play a game called Simon Says.
[00:14.08]If you don't know how to play that, then you're just dead anyway.
[00:16.50]So are we ready?
[00:17.50]Everybody turn to me.
[00:18.46]The game's gonna start when you turn to me.
[00:20.00]Now, Simon says turn to me.
[00:23.77]Okay, Simon says... Ow, hold on.
[00:27.73]Kill him!
[00:28.21]Get that son of a bitch!
[00:29.97]Oh, hold on.
[00:30.47]I gotta... Hold on a second, guys.
[00:32.83]Simon says we're gonna jump...
[00:37.39]That guy on the left, okay, he did, he did, he's good.
[00:40.65]Simon says, sing a wonderful song.
[00:49.67]Uh, sorry, that wasn't fucking good enough.
[00:55.17]Well, I thought that's what, that's what you, they didn't do what I wanted them to do, so I killed them.
[01:00.25]That's how you're supposed to play.
[01:04.97]What?
[01:05.23]What do I do?
[01:06.03]If you rebel, we will kill you.
[01:08.26]What does that mean, rebel?
[01:13.38]What?
[01:13.94]Oh.
[01:14.56]Oh, whoops.
[01:17.74]Shot accidentally.
[01:19.18]Is there a disco here?
[01:20.32]What the hell is that?
[01:24.87]Can we have a disco party after this?
[01:27.45]I want to play disco.
[01:28.75]I know I've been bad, but still.
[01:30.91]Don't gun plant.
[01:34.39]Is anybody going to answer me?
[01:36.29]I'm trying to ask a question.
[01:38.33]I want Warden again.
[01:39.35]Give it to me.
[01:40.13]Give me Warden.
[01:45.47]I'm not listening to you.
[01:49.53]I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want because I don't care.
[01:51.83]How about that one?
[01:52.89]Your microphone might sound better if you stop using a potato.
[01:56.93]What's a potato?
[01:57.58]What are you talking about?
[02:01.22]Are you talking to me?
[02:02.04]Not you, Gramps.
[02:04.70]He just killed me for no reason.
[02:06.44]That guy first came to show me for no reason.
[02:08.32]I want him reported.
[02:09.26]I want him in jail.
[02:11.08]Listen, everybody shut the... Shut the fuck up, everybody.
[02:14.58]Okay.
[02:15.48]So, on the count of... I never told you to come down here.
[02:19.45]Nobody said to come down here.
[02:20.71]You have five seconds to go back up the stairs.
[02:22.77]Five, four, three, three, three.
[02:24.93]He made it.
[02:25.41]Okay.
[02:26.33]So, everybody now... I want you all to come to the line and line up crouching.
[02:32.59]If you are not crouching, then you are just dead, and that's all I gotta say, so get down here.
[02:38.82]All my friends will shoot.
[02:40.60]Don't shoot him!
[02:41.28]Okay, so when you're lying up... Uh, no, don't kill him.
[02:46.48]He just wanted to say hi and give you a hug.
[02:49.29]Okay, so what we're gonna do here...
[02:51.55]What we're gonna do is we're gonna have all these CTs please line up here with me.
[02:57.00]Line up side by side with me.
[02:58.97]And because you guys have been so good, you terrorists, will you cut to shit?
[03:05.32]Quit shooting people in the face!
[03:06.84]What the hell, man?
[03:08.36]Okay, what?
[03:09.22]Seriously?
[03:10.50]Seriously, I'm trying to talk here.
[03:12.87]I want all the T's to come and give your favorite CT a hug.
[03:16.55]Okay, let's do it.
[03:17.33]Everyone come give us a hug.
[03:19.13]Yeah, I love hugs too.
[03:20.81]Yay, thank you for the hug.
[03:22.53]That's a wonderful hug you're giving me.
[03:24.93]What the fuck?
[03:29.95]You're supposed to hug people!
[03:32.49]Alright, so all the ones... I forgive your free kill.
[03:36.01]Thank you.
[03:36.79]I didn't mean to.
[03:37.89]It was not me.
