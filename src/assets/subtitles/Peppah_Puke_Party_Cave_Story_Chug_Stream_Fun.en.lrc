[03:05.79]It's gonna happen.
[03:10.54]I'm gonna savor it for like two minutes and then I'm not gonna tell you when I'm gonna do it.
[03:15.47]So here's how it's gonna happen.
[03:18.43]I'm gonna just do it at a very random time.
[03:21.05]You're not gonna know until it happens.
[03:22.83]So there you go.
[03:26.50]Oh, this is delicious.

[03:33.24]Where do I go?
[03:35.88]I have no idea where... I didn't even read one word of that text.
[03:38.98]Can somebody tell me where I'm going?
[03:42.82]Maybe I'll just talk to him again.
[03:44.34]Take Sue and escape from this island, please.

[03:49.17]I thought she went to bed.
[03:52.41]So how do I equip it?
[03:55.77]Press the jump button while airborne and boost in one of four directions.
[04:00.38]Yeah, I want to equip it.
[04:01.38]Are you kidding me?
[04:04.42]Let's go.
[04:07.00]Oh, man.

[04:35.28]I gotta go to the egg?
[04:37.40]Right.
[04:41.20]Alright, we're going to the egg corridor.
[04:47.67]You thought I was gonna chug it, didn't you?
[04:51.07]No, you're never gonna know when that happens.
[04:52.31]It's just gonna happen.
[04:53.05]Hey, dude.
[04:59.03]I don't know what's going on.
[04:59.91]Why are you asking me?

[06:34.25]Cave Story, the regular Cave Story, I believe, is free, is it?
[06:36.86]But Cave Story Plus is not free.
[06:39.22]You can get it on Steam.
[06:41.08]I believe for $10.
[06:43.58]I could be wrong.
[06:47.59]So, should I... Do I have to go in this door?
[07:08.32]That was such a bad idea whose idea was that?
[07:13.22]Whose idea was that because we're no longer friends It was my idea Jerma you're not my friend anymore.
[07:24.41]Oh Do I have to have like a boss fight right now?
[07:26.24]I'm gonna die Why did I just kill that guy?
[07:33.84]It will harm your health.
[07:38.00]No, I'll be fine.
[07:43.73]That's not the first time I've done that.
