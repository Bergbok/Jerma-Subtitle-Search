[01:13.80]When are we going to get nuclear-powered?
[01:15.88]Take responsibility.
[01:21.52]Yeah, maybe one day we'll have a beer, and I'll explain how the world really works.

[01:51.79]Is this going to instantly kill me, or am I gonna get under it?
[01:56.38]Nope.
[01:57.04]I'm dead.
[02:00.84]This guy just had a problem from the very second I saw him.
[02:04.76]Nice punch.
[02:06.17]Let me show you how it's done.
[02:10.23]The first person punching is just ridiculous.
[02:13.35]Will you get out of here?
[02:14.15]You're gonna get run over.
[02:18.51]Don't ever take your eyes off the fight.
[02:20.39]That was your first mistake.
[02:22.11]Actually, that was like your tenth mistake.
[02:25.66]Not entirely sure what you've done to get this to happen, Franklin.
[02:28.76]There's no stars, so that's not what's going on here.
[02:31.50]There's a cop that is just an absolute psychopath over here.
[02:34.62]I'm not sure what he's doing.
[02:36.35]Yep.
[02:37.89]This makes complete sense.
[02:40.01]First thing I want to ask is, uh, number one, why is this happening?
[02:44.55]And number two, why is Franklin still alive?
[02:49.50]He's just, this guy's shooting with a shotgun over and over again.
[02:53.42]And he's just, like, standing here completely fine.
[02:56.67]Is this guy shooting, like, funny bullets at him?
[02:58.57]Like, I don't get it.
[03:00.49]He's, like, taking cover!
[03:01.53]Oh, I gotta take cover!
[03:02.73]D-d-dip around the corner!
[03:07.31]What are you doing?!
[03:11.41]He shot him, like, twelve times!
[03:15.11]Frank, let's not even do it!
[03:16.17]Oh, I gotta dive over the bush!
[03:17.41]We gotta get out of here!
[03:18.15]This is still happening.
[03:24.56]Is this guy gonna run out of bullets?
[03:28.56]Hey everybody, it's Mr. Sneak Man.
[03:30.79]This episode of Mr. Sneak Man's movie is Mr. Sneak Man holds middle finger out the window and it's not real sneaky at all now is it?
