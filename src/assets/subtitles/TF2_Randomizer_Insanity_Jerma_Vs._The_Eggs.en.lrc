[00:08.25]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.91]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.67]And what is going on in the screen right now?
[00:16.83]This is Randomizer.
[00:18.21]If you don't know what Randomizer is, this is a crazy mod for Team Fortress 2.
[00:23.12]And what it does is it makes you spawn with a random class and a random loadout.
[00:28.54]And I don't mean a random loadout like as in you spawn as the heavy and you get a random heavy loadout.
[00:33.74]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:34.46]You spawn as the Heavy with a flamethrower and, like, the Jurati.
[00:38.91]It's crazy.
[00:40.01]I suggest you try and find a server.
[00:41.79]Sometimes it's hard to find a randomizer server, but if you can get in one, my god, this is, like, the funniest goddamn thing I've ever done in this game.
[00:50.44]And the reason why it's so funny is because everything just gets so broken.
[00:54.40]You'll see coming up later, I play as the soldier with a Tomislav, and whenever you shoot the thing, your Tomislav goes up and down a hundred miles per hour.
[01:03.57]It is insane.
[01:04.75]It almost made me want to... I had... I got a headache.
[01:06.95]I had to stop doing it.
[01:08.01]I was like, okay, I want to die with this class.
[01:09.74]Screw this.
[01:11.02]And really this last, I'd say last three or four days, I've just been going into Team Fortress and playing these crazy mods.
[01:18.57]One of the mods, one of the favorite ones, my goodness, Balloon Race.
[01:22.23]I've only found one or two servers that actually play Balloon Race.
[01:26.76]And I want to play them all day now.
[01:28.68]I got to get some more guys into there.
[01:30.20]Got to get more awareness to Balloon Race because it is so much fun.
[01:33.88]And also all crit servers.
[01:35.34]I've been doing that too.
[01:36.61]So I've been being a real weirdo on Team Fortress lately.
[01:39.17]Expect some videos on some of these crazy mods.
[01:41.89]I'll probably do a Saxton Hale mod.
[01:44.01]Probably do Prop Hunt.
[01:45.57]So expect those at some point in the future.
[01:47.63]It's just something I've been having a lot of fun doing.
[01:50.46]So now I want to go on a different track, and I want to talk about a certain bet that I made with you guys.
[01:56.61]Probably a week or two ago when I did the facecam video, all I've been seeing is comments telling me I gotta eat the egg, where's the egg, I gotta eat that damn egg.
[02:06.31]So if you missed the video, or to refresh your memory, this is what I said.
[02:11.22]I will swallow a whole egg.
[02:14.54]A whole egg I will eat, if I don't take those out, like right now.
[02:22.75]What?
[02:23.51]What?
[02:24.87]No, I don't want to eat an egg.
[02:25.95]I do not want to eat an egg.
[02:27.72]I got to eat an egg.
[02:30.56]So judging by what happened in the video, I have to eat an egg.
[02:35.23]And I did say in that video, I did say to eat a raw egg.
[02:38.39]I was gonna eat a raw egg.
[02:40.07]But guys, you can't eat raw eggs.
[02:42.97]If you eat a raw egg, I mean, it's not terrible, but there's a chance you can contract salmonella, and I don't wanna have that looming over my head when I eat it.
[02:52.86]So this is what I'm proposing to you guys.
[02:54.98]This is what I'm gonna do this weekend.
[02:57.84]This Saturday during my livestream, it's gonna be the egg stream.
[03:02.60]And what do I mean by egg stream?
[03:04.69]I'm gonna cook up 12 or 24 hard-boiled eggs, and every time I'm gonna play Team Fortress 2, every single time I die, I'm gonna eat one of the hard-boiled eggs.
[03:16.71]Until they're all gone.
[03:18.95]So if I'm having a really bad night on TF2, I'm gonna eat a dozen eggs, or even more than that, maybe two dozen eggs if I'm doing really bad.
[03:27.30]So I suggest you try and show up to that.
[03:29.58]Gonna be pretty entertaining for you.
[03:31.74]Awful for me, potentially.
[03:33.32]I like eggs.
[03:33.94]I mean, don't get me wrong.
[03:34.96]I like eggs.
[03:36.08]I just don't like eating 50 eggs, you know?
[03:39.20]It's gonna be interesting.
[03:40.98]So now that that is out of the way, I'll talk about Randomizer for a little bit and what's going on right now.
[03:46.14]I happened to bonk that heavy, but he ended up getting the kill on me.
[03:48.67]Actually, somebody shot me with... I don't even know what the hell... What gun is that?
[03:52.51]I've never seen that before.
[03:53.95]Well...
[03:54.85]Anyways, this is the part what I was talking about before with the... I feel like I'm in a blender when I watch this.
[04:02.61]Oh my god.
[04:04.05]This is exactly what I was talking about when I said things just become broken.
[04:08.69]As you can see, that's not normal.
[04:10.37]That is not normal.
[04:11.95]You are absolutely not supposed to get electrocuted when you shoot the Tommy Slop.
[04:16.64]That's not supposed to happen.
[04:20.12]And I found from playing this for a little bit, the best thing you could possibly get is probably the scout with the minigun.
[04:27.31]Or second best would probably be heavy with the Medi Gun.
[04:31.42]So you can be a healer with 300 health.
[04:33.82]It's just mind-boggling.
[04:36.11]And the worst loadout you can get is anything to do with a soldier banner, because I don't think they even work.
[04:42.20]I tried to blow the horn.
[04:43.24]I had the Buff Banner at one point when I was playing earlier, and I got like 9 million damage, and it didn't even matter.
[04:49.73]I tried to blow the horn.
[04:50.61]Nothing happened.
[04:51.19]It just kind of was broken in my hand.
[04:53.23]And I'm pretty sure there's a lot of other stuff that's broken as well.
[04:55.93]I can't really think on the top of my head right now, but I'm pretty sure engineer buildings, I don't think you can do them as other classes.
[05:02.46]Or the spy disguises or the spy watches.
[05:05.56]I'm pretty sure they don't work.
[05:07.88]And how funny would that be though?
[05:09.62]How hysterical would that be if you could see a heavy kind of crouching in the corner with the disguise mask on his face?
[05:15.49]Just sitting there with like the Cloak and Dagger or something.
[05:17.69]No, that would be so awesome.
[05:19.65]But this is going to be the end of the gameplay, guys.
[05:22.11]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:24.05]I really do appreciate it.
[05:25.42]And come to that livestream this weekend.
[05:28.02]6 p.m.
[05:28.42]Eastern Time, if you don't know, if you've never been there before, if you are a longtime streamgoer, should be a great time, should be crazy.
[05:35.66]I wonder how many eggs I'm going to be able to eat.
[05:39.81]That's the real question.
[05:41.21]Question of the video.
[05:42.29]Here it goes.
[05:42.75]Ready?
[05:42.95]Here's the question.
[05:43.91]How many eggs do you think I'm going to eat in that live stream?
[05:48.20]So I look forward to your responses, and I'll see you guys all soon.
[05:51.56]Take care, everybody.
