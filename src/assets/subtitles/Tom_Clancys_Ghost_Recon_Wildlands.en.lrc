[01:14.62]Hey.
[01:17.70]Good afternoon.
[01:18.86]Happy Saturday.
[01:21.72]Or Sunday for some of you guys.
[01:22.84]And some of you guys in Europe might already be Sunday.
[01:27.77]Welcome to a Saturday stream.
[01:32.45]Me and Italics are going to be playing some Ghost Recon Wildlands.
[01:39.14]Yes, it will be with Italics.
[01:40.18]He is joining us.
[01:40.94]He is in the call.
[01:41.72]Well, he's currently doing his own stream.
[01:46.04]This game's going to be hard to stream, kind of, because it has CPU issues.
[01:54.12]This game rocks.
[01:56.69]Me and Italics both are having problems with streaming and playing this game.
[02:00.37]We've dropped settings, we've tried a lot of things.
[02:02.73]So there might be intermittent lag issues.
[02:06.85]There might be frame skips every now and again because there's just nothing we can do about it.
[02:11.72]Fucking shitty 780, you know what I mean?
[02:15.10]This is the beta.
[02:17.88]This game's not out yet.
[02:18.66]It's not coming out until, like, March, but this is the beta.
[02:21.70]We figured we would give it a try.
[02:22.90]Talix was like, you want to play?
[02:23.74]I'm like, absolutely.
[02:25.22]Yes, sure.
[02:30.51]How's that 780?
[02:31.31]20 FPS?
[02:34.91]No, it shouldn't be that bad.
[02:37.79]It should be okay.
[02:41.13]This game runs like garbage for me, and my PC's better than Jeremiah's.
[02:46.11]Is there a backup if it goes south?
[02:47.89]We'll have to figure that out in real time.
[02:53.47]One FPS 24-hour stream.
[02:55.31]I'm not sure about that, but we're here.
[02:56.81]Let's move over to the game.
[02:59.00]Get this back to where it was.
[03:02.18]And close this out.
[03:08.62]Here it is.
[03:10.94]Here it is.
[03:11.50]Ghost Recon Wildlands.
[03:15.63]Hopefully it doesn't run like shit.
[03:17.17]It's pitch black out right now.
[03:18.71]Just kind of waiting for italics.
[03:19.65]I'm going to make my tweet to say, hey, I'm streaming right now.
[03:28.24]And there was a subscription.
[03:33.26]There was a subscription.
[03:34.16]Let's see what it was.
[03:36.82]It was...
[03:40.81]Quintin Harlan, thanks for five months.
[03:42.25]Jerma2 is posting a lot and I'm loving it.
[03:43.99]Yes.
[03:45.25]They were in the middle of Fuck It February.
[03:49.52]Fuck It February is in full effect.
[03:52.22]28 days, 28 videos.
[03:56.46]So yeah, it's a good thing.
[03:59.26]Mackerel is doing a lot of good shit with that channel.
[04:01.74]He's doing a lot of work, so.
[04:05.13]But thank you, ZombieMan4, for the 10 months.
[04:08.19]Hope you can scare away the spooky ghosts.
[04:11.53]Yeah, this is a horror game, guys.
[04:12.55]Well, thank you, Zombieman.
[04:13.75]SFM James, 18 months.
[04:15.63]SFM James, 18 fucking months.
[04:18.61]That's the first time when I've seen... What?
[04:22.30]You're almost at two years.
[04:23.56]Wait, what?
[04:25.78]18 months, SFM James.
[04:27.16]Damn, dude.
[04:28.62]Thanks, man.
[04:31.04]Thank you, Spirit Tech, for the two months.
[04:32.90]You had a breakup today?
[04:33.72]Well, I'm sorry to hear that, man.
[04:35.52]Keep your chin up, dude.
[04:37.97]I wish you the best.
[04:41.32]Also, thanks to Joe, boy, for the five months.
[04:43.80]Welcome back.
[04:45.66]Yeah, sorry, I missed a bunch of subs last night.
[04:47.52]I'll address that when more people come in here, when we get a full crowd, I guess you could say.
[04:54.47]I will address what happened last night.
[05:01.65]And move this to here.
[05:06.04]We're just hanging out, waiting for italics, and we're gonna play some wildlands.
[05:08.86]I have no idea how this game even is.
[05:11.90]This game might be a piece of shit.
[05:12.94]I have no idea.
[05:14.00]Might be fun.
[05:16.76]But thank you, Rowaha, for the five months.
[05:19.48]And xnopb, thanks for the sub.
[05:28.78]Let's see if I can drop any frames here.
[05:30.78]I don't think I'm going to.
[05:32.12]At least not here.
[05:32.74]When it's this dark out.
[05:36.45]Play more Family Feud?
[05:37.85]We could do that.
[05:38.87]We actually could do that.
[05:41.77]In fact, I might just do that anyways.
[05:43.67]More like dumb, shitty Super Nintendo Family Feud.
[05:47.23]We gotta win.
[05:55.19]TeamSpeak in 2017?
[05:55.91]What's wrong with TeamSpeak?
[05:58.23]They're ready for another terrible game?
[06:04.63]Is this game terrible?
[06:06.62]What's the general consensus on this game?
[06:10.86]Family Feud is fun.
[06:11.64]Definitely going to play.
[06:12.90]Here's the hell with this.
[06:14.08]Before I end the stream tonight, we will play shitty Family Feud for like 40 minutes or something.
[06:19.99]Or however long a game or two goes.
[06:24.25]Normal people use Discord.
[06:25.35]I use Discord.
[06:27.97]But sometimes it's like... This is like a private TeamSpeak.
[06:32.53]It's not like... There's like 30 people in here.
[06:35.44]No, it's just a private team.
[06:36.72]Hey, Mexican Radio, thanks for the 200 bits.
[06:40.62]You asked Star if he could do your algebra homework for you.
[06:42.42]He said no.
[06:43.16]Can you do my algebra homework for me?
[06:46.25]No.
[06:48.09]I'm not going to do your algebra.
[06:49.21]Oh, we got movement.
[06:50.23]Italics is moving.
[06:53.39]We've got movement here.
[06:55.81]Is he with us?
[06:56.91]Is he available?
[06:57.61]Uh-oh.
[07:01.31]Hello?
[07:03.27]Hello?
[07:08.00]I think he's like, oh, we could use night vision.
[07:09.85]Oh, I hate that.
[07:13.17]You can do private room on Discord.
[07:14.37]Yeah, I know, but this is like, Italics is paying for this server.
[07:18.31]This is like Italics' server.
[07:23.59]It's just like where we meet up sometimes.
[07:27.84]Why am I a Scooby-Doo swamp monster?
[07:29.48]Because the character creation in this game is fucking terrible.
[07:36.18]The character creator is how many leaves do you want on your guy?
[07:42.56]Somewhat leafy, little bit of leaves, lots of leaves, or cousin it.
[07:48.18]Those are the character creation options in Wildlands at the moment.
[07:52.42]Or you can put a cowboy hat on.
[08:00.16]Let's just take a look.
[08:02.10]That's how you crouch.
[08:06.16]Oh, look at... You can see the lights of Vegas.
[08:08.48]You can see Las Vegas.
[08:10.74]Wow.
[08:11.28]Can't wait to go double zero.
[08:17.28]All the leaves.
[08:17.76]I just want it to be daytime.
[08:18.78]I hate night cycles.
[08:22.40]I just want games with day cycles.
[08:27.02]Never trust a purple for five months.
[08:28.12]Here's your chance to prove you're one of the best.
[08:31.36]What does that mean?
[08:33.14]Thank you for five months, dude.
[08:34.46]Oh, thank you, Minxie.
[08:35.60]Minxie, one of our mods.
[08:36.54]Two of our mods.
[08:37.60]Subscribed there.
[08:38.44]13 months for Minxie.
[08:40.39]Thank you, Minxie.
[08:42.27]And Nano for three months.
[08:44.47]Thank you, Nano.
[08:46.57]Thank you, Nano.
[08:48.39]Whoa!
[08:48.65]Hey, how are you?
[08:51.20]Sorry to interrupt.
[08:52.36]How are things going?
[08:56.05]You know how they're going.
[08:57.07]They're going terribly.
[08:58.19]They're going terribly.
[08:59.11]But hopefully they'll be really fun things very soon.
[09:02.54]Okay.
[09:03.60]Are you still streaming?
[09:04.62]Are you streaming?
[09:05.62]No.
[09:06.30]Oh, no.
[09:06.68]I'm ready to go.
[09:07.38]Oh, all right.
[09:09.64]Well, it's Alex.
[09:10.54]I'm ready whenever you are.
[09:11.80]I'm just hanging out.
[09:12.72]We're just hanging out, talking about fucking... Talking about how dark this game is at night?
[09:18.47]Yeah, talking about how I hate this night cycle and don't disturb those rocks.
[09:23.51]So what are we doing?
[09:24.67]What do you do in this game?
[09:25.77]What is this game?
[09:27.56]You hit M, open the map, and you see that little white border?
[09:31.58]I think that's the beta border.
[09:33.74]And we have to do stuff here.
[09:35.54]So we're only locked into Nebraska.
[09:41.70]What state is this?
[09:42.50]This is the state of Itakua.
[09:45.79]This is like moron Massachusetts.
[09:49.39]Yeah.
[09:50.09]This is Massachusetts.
[09:51.37]We're in Massachusetts right now.
[09:54.92]Boston's right here.
[09:56.40]This is the Cape.
[09:58.56]Up here, this is like Worcester.
[09:59.86]This is like Revere.
[10:01.54]You want to see where I live?
[10:04.36]You guys want to see where I live in Massachusetts?
[10:06.04]Where do you think it is?
[10:08.92]Boink!
[10:09.32]Come fucking find me here!
[10:10.78]Right here!
[10:12.22]There I am.
[10:16.40]Alright, what are we doing?
[10:17.62]What's the mission?
[10:19.46]We're supposed to probably get a car, and you're on a mission called Amaru's Rescue.
[10:25.41]That is correct.
[10:26.75]So, we're doing that.
[10:30.21]Where did you put the cars, though?
[10:32.43]We were waiting, kind of like testing shit, so I think we drove them all off cliffs.
[10:37.67]We didn't do that.
[10:38.22]Sounds about right.
[10:40.82]Um, what about this?
[10:41.66]Can we get in this, like, farm car?
[10:43.67]Or is this thing not available?
[10:45.17]No?
[10:46.79]I believe that's missing at least two wheels.
[10:48.73]Wasn't there a truck here?
[10:52.03]There was, I know.
[10:53.81]Why is this thing flashing?
[10:54.85]Is this ammo?
[10:55.85]Yeah, it's ammo.
[10:57.03]Alright, can we, like, reload this?
[11:01.48]Oh, there we go.
[11:02.08]Hit V. V. Yeah, but we need... I think the car's down here, actually.
[11:09.23]Yeah, remember we were like driving around to test the CPU shit?
[11:14.92]Wasn't it like over here?
[11:15.66]Here we go.
[11:16.24]This is the same game, right?
[11:17.68]What the hell is that?
[11:18.48]This is the same game.
[11:19.84]What is that?
[11:21.70]Is this oil?
[11:25.02]How do we like capitalize on the oil?
[11:30.75]Alright, well you're good.
[11:31.35]You found the car.
[11:32.67]I did.
[11:35.03]We can't like just get like a siphon that oil?
[11:39.40]That's a different game.
[11:43.48]This is so ugly.
[11:46.26]I can't even tell if we're driving.
[11:48.60]Well, we're not when we're rolling over.
[11:50.25]This is my favorite radio station.
[11:55.43]I don't even have the radio on.
[12:00.13]Something tells me we shouldn't be, like, going this way.
[12:02.93]I feel like a snake slithering down the hill.
[12:05.37]Can it just be fucking daytime?
[12:06.89]Okay, I found the road.
[12:07.60]Alright, I want that... Okay, I think you killed that guy.
[12:15.70]You may have accidentally killed a person.
[12:18.14]Oh, wait, give me that car!
[12:21.30]Give me that car!
[12:23.26]It's yours!
[12:24.32]Nice.
[12:25.44]Wait, what?
[12:27.08]Did you hear that guy?
[12:30.31]God, it's just like GTA!
[12:32.27]Wait, I can kill civilians?
[12:33.69]What?
[12:35.19]This really is GTA.
[12:40.24]It's a long night cycle.
[12:48.38]He just exploded out of his windshield.
[12:52.83]That guy fell out of the car.
[12:57.59]Oh, it would be real funny if we could see this shit.
[13:00.91]Don't shoot this guy.
[13:01.63]Don't shoot this guy.
[13:02.27]Don't shoot this guy.
[13:02.97]I'm so sorry.
[13:03.97]I didn't know.
[13:05.65]Where are we going?
[13:07.17]Kill another civilian and you will fail your mission.
[13:09.75]Oh, what the fuck?
[13:11.33]Which I don't know what that means.
[13:12.45]It probably just means start over.
[13:13.64]Are these civilians?
[13:14.08]Let's find out.
[13:16.10]I don't think those are civilians.
[13:17.01]Those are, like, bad guys, right?
[13:19.11]By the way, driving cars in this game is fucking impossible.
[13:22.05]It is.
[13:22.31]The keyboard does not lend itself well at all.
[13:25.83]The keyboard is not good for driving cars.
[13:29.57]I failed the mission.
[13:30.71]You failed the mission?
[13:31.88]Yeah.
[13:33.02]How have I not failed the mission?
[13:35.34]I guess so.
[13:36.02]It doesn't punish the entire team.
[13:38.08]Oh.
[13:40.20]Okay.
[13:40.62]Well, can you, like, respawn into me?
[13:44.08]No.
[13:46.63]No.
[13:47.29]I am in a jeep back where we started, actually.
[13:52.45]I can't even fucking see what I'm doing.
[13:56.13]Thankfully, the game just prevented me from getting into the water.
[13:58.40]That's nice.
[13:59.10]Thank you, game.
[13:59.86]I'm just playing my summer car again.
[14:02.66]That's all this is.
[14:03.50]This is my summer car again.
[14:06.32]Who the fuck is this guy in the water?
[14:07.56]This looks like somebody fishing.
[14:11.19]Alright, I'm driving back to you right now.
[14:14.08]I think it's impossible to stay flipped over.
[14:16.04]Drive back to me because I need your headlights.
[14:23.27]Come back to me.
[14:25.09]Working on it.
[14:26.59]I have a friend here.
[14:28.05]I'm waiting for you.
[14:35.15]It's actually starting to become nicer and light out.
[14:41.43]It's just hanging out here by the lake.
[14:47.40]You're like two kilometers away.
[14:50.36]My lights do work.
[14:53.59]Which doesn't sound that far, except you don't know what I'm driving.
[14:57.75]What are you driving?
[14:59.75]You don't know.
[15:00.19]Wait, like Jupiter going on in the chat right now?
[15:05.63]A lot of Jupiter failed.
[15:07.85]You are far away right now.
[15:09.63]Very far away.
[15:11.86]I'm at least 60 seconds away.
[15:14.28]I'm just going to make this guy look into a spooky ghost story.
[15:19.88]I regret shooting the civilian.
[15:23.00]I want to put the lights on this person.
[15:24.39]I don't want them to tell me a scary story by the campfire.
[15:31.55]I'm just barely not hurting this person.
[15:36.62]This is so dark!
[15:39.40]Why is it this dark?
[15:41.22]For spec ops, man.
[15:43.14]You can be stealthy.
[15:51.72]I'm stuck.
[15:56.69]I don't think I can get... I don't think I can kill this person.
[16:02.15]I've been trying to run this person over for about three minutes now.
[16:05.96]I'm less than a kilometer away.
[16:07.46]I'm almost there.
[16:10.84]Sincerely?
[16:12.02]Like, please come kill this person.
[16:13.48]Because I can't do it.
[16:14.22]Can I fucking...
[16:23.24]I see there you are you're coming you're almost there seven six five I'm counting way too slow okay now it's gonna be six here we go five oh I need like a horn how long is this fucking night cycle
[16:47.06]This night cycle is so fucking crazy long.
[16:49.52]I found the cowl.
[16:55.81]Oh, you were right about the water.
[16:57.83]That killed him.
[16:58.25]They're dead.
[16:59.11]That person's dead now.
[17:01.13]Okay.
[17:03.33]That's great.
[17:04.21]That only took like fucking 12 minutes.
[17:07.81]One.
[17:08.01]Alright, let me in.
[17:18.70]Can I not get in this?
[17:19.76]I don't think I can get in this.
[17:20.68]You picked a terrible fucking car to come over here with, by the way.
[17:24.26]Oh wait, no, no, no, I can get on the back.
[17:25.59]I can ride on your pegs.
[17:27.67]Oh, yeah.
[17:28.57]Oh, that's awesome.
[17:31.21]That's what I'm talking about.
[17:32.53]Alright, how do we get to the mission?
[17:34.93]I don't know.
[17:35.39]Hold on, I'm gonna click the button.
[17:39.22]I wish this wasn't like a 45 minute night cycle.
[17:44.83]Turn your gamma up.
[17:45.77]Use gamma exploit.
[17:47.01]Should I turn it on?
[17:47.97]When it becomes daytime, it's going to be unbearable.
[17:53.17]Hey, thank you, YolaRag, for the two months.
[17:55.25]Dr. Dadma for five months.
[17:56.85]Foy, five months.
[17:59.77]WolfH for the 12 months.
[18:01.43]It was the only car that was there, okay?
[18:03.89]ATF412, thanks for two months.
[18:06.19]And I have a Red Fez for two months, too.
[18:09.25]Thanks a lot, guys.
[18:09.97]And SwissChills, thanks for two months, SwissChills.
[18:24.02]God damn it.
[18:25.38]That's not what I wanted to do.
[18:27.53]So, has it occurred to you that maybe by selecting this mission, it made it nighttime until we finished the mission?
[18:34.05]Is that what's going on?
[18:35.63]I don't know.
[18:36.11]It could be.
[18:36.51]This is just, like, getting annoying.
[18:39.25]And how do I get back in the car?
[18:42.01]You're in the car.
[18:42.67]Yeah, but I don't want to be in this, like, third... There we go.
[18:44.80]No.
[18:46.62]Get me out of this...
[18:51.20]Oh, this is grenades, by the way.
[18:52.54]You hold G, you have a grenade.
[18:58.68]I just realized I have to let go of this at some point.
[19:01.11]No, no, I can cancel it.
[19:01.97]Okay, cancel.
[19:06.33]Alright, we can hijack a car like in two seconds.
[19:09.51]Yeah, we gotta get a car.
[19:11.13]This thing is a piece of crap.
[19:12.67]Just make sure you don't accidentally kill too many civilians and reset the whole thing.
[19:16.62]I won't, don't worry.
[19:18.53]There's a car right here.
[19:20.51]There's two.

[19:47.56]This way?
[19:48.76]Let's go, yeah.

[21:15.74]This is the only thing that matters.
[21:18.99]What is this?
[21:19.75]Is this a supply plane or something?
[21:21.05]Talix, nothing matters.
[21:21.81]We have bikes.
[21:24.18]Do you think anything fucking matters anymore?
[21:25.86]Jesus Christ.
[21:31.16]It took two seconds for my headlamp to turn off.
[21:35.57]How did I stay on the bike?
[21:39.43]Wait, I think we were supposed to protect that.
[21:42.09]Go back.
[21:42.47]Back up.
[21:42.89]There's a bunch of red things up there now.
[21:44.93]Yeah, well, fuck it.

[25:31.74]Okay.
[25:34.60]Alright.
[25:35.38]I turned into a grenade in his room.

[25:44.74]Boy, you're down?
[25:45.86]Yeah.

[25:54.72]Alright, take out this.
[25:56.10]I'm telling you, we can get this guy with a grenade.
[25:59.24]He's sitting.
[25:59.90]Just get him in the window.
[26:00.60]We have to interrogate him.
[26:02.04]Interrogate him?

[26:31.98]All right.
[26:32.76]Let's interrogate this guy.
[26:40.62]How do we interrogate him?
[26:42.37]We probably punch him repeatedly until he tells us what we want to know.
[26:46.13]How do you do it?
[26:49.01]What's punch?
[26:51.30]Is there a punch?
[26:54.98]Interrogate the lieutenant.

[27:00.90]Grab him.
[27:01.26]I got him.

[28:25.76]I'll tag him, you bag him.
[28:26.91]I'll bag him.
[28:28.35]I'm gonna bag this guy.
[28:29.07]You ready?
[28:29.65]Watch out for the bees.
[28:33.91]Anybody else in front of me?
[28:36.11]You got two more people tagged.
[28:37.27]Got him.
[28:41.24]See you later motherfucker.
[28:43.16]Let's go.
[28:43.56]We're going for a walk.
[28:45.60]You and me.
[28:49.08]Get down there.
[28:50.64]Get down there.
[28:54.72]I wanna like bring him up the rock.
[28:56.38]Here.
[28:56.96]Oh.
[29:01.68]We're just like taking a walk.
[29:02.82]Alright, me and this guy are having like a good time.
[29:04.42]We're having like a friend time.
[29:08.34]Um.
[29:09.67]Have they discovered you yet?
[29:11.39]No.
[29:11.97]No, they're playing hopscotch.
[29:13.65]No, they're playing soccer.
[29:14.93]I got a skill point.
[29:19.07]Skill point.
[29:19.57]Stable aim.
[29:21.21]Alright, let's do that.
[29:23.39]Physical?
[29:23.84]Wait.
[29:24.30]Stamina.
[29:24.82]No pain.
[29:27.54]I guess we're just gonna do hip fire.
[29:29.44]Alright, so if we do this right, he doesn't go hide inside the building.
[29:33.06]He's actually pretty close.
[29:34.32]Okay.
[29:36.12]I think I can turn my brightness down a little.
[29:40.07]I'm gonna do that.
[29:42.64]Brightness will bring it down.
[29:43.86]Gamma will bring it down.
[29:44.74]All right.
[29:45.44]We're going to do a classic Splinter Cell move here.
[29:47.77]All right.
[29:48.09]You ready?
[29:48.67]This looks awful now.
[29:50.17]All right.
[29:50.39]Classic Splinter Cell.
[29:51.51]What is it?
[29:52.15]There's two guys.
[29:53.21]We each shoot one of them.
[29:54.95]Two guys each shoot one.
[29:56.37]Yeah.
[29:57.30]All right.
[29:57.56]So which one do you want to shoot?
[29:59.76]Do you have a silenced gun out?
[30:01.34]I think, yeah.
[30:01.78]I think so.
[30:03.46]All right, yeah, I'll get the guy that's currently... What is this guy doing?
[30:08.52]He's playing soccer with him.
[30:10.02]Good luck hitting him in the head.
[30:11.48]I thought somebody was... He's dancing around.
[30:13.30]I thought somebody was shooting his feet.
[30:16.95]My guy's just sitting still.
[30:19.23]I will get the guy playing soccer.
[30:21.49]You get the guy that's taking a nap on the bench.
[30:25.44]Are you ready?
[30:25.98]I just called my guy.
[30:27.14]What do you mean you just called your guy?
[30:28.86]I guess it's for people who don't have voice chat.
[30:30.53]Like, I just tagged mine with Q. Alright, actually, that one's harder.
[30:34.85]You take the guy with the... I'll get the guy that's sitting down.
[30:37.77]You gotta get the guy that finds longer.
[30:38.81]Oh, yeah, I'll get the tough guy.
[30:41.21]Your line of sight is better.
[30:43.27]Alright, ready?
[30:44.93]3, 2, 1, go.
[30:47.90]By the way, that was the same guy.
[30:51.06]No, it was his twin brother.
[30:52.26]There's like five people that are the same person there.
[30:54.74]Okay, what else we got?
[30:56.06]They're just brothers.
[30:57.04]It's racist.
[30:57.94]Alright, keep going.
[31:00.40]No, they're like wearing the same clothes.
[31:03.91]There's like four people wearing the exact same outfit.
[31:06.29]No, they just like to trick people.
[31:09.47]How do I switch the camera back?
[31:13.26]You gotta get the drone out.
[31:25.38]I think there's only two people up there.
[31:26.68]It's just the guy and the guy.
[31:27.80]Does that guy have a rocket launcher in his hands?
[31:30.57]What is that guy holding?
[31:35.89]He dropped it.
[31:39.23]He saw us.
[31:40.13]He was looking right at us.
[31:41.61]What is he holding?
[31:43.85]What is this?
[31:45.51]Nothing important, apparently.
[31:46.51]That is like a PP-19 with a... Yeah.
[31:51.49]It's got like a horizontal magazine.
[31:54.40]I'm going to do a drone.
[31:55.24]How do you switch shoulders?
[31:59.77]I was trying to figure that out too.
[32:00.93]Interrogate that guy.
[32:01.85]I don't see anybody else.
[32:06.27]He's next to the porta-potty.
[32:07.79]We've got to wait until he goes in the porta-potty and then dump it over the cliff, right?
[32:13.89]Going in.
[32:14.93]No, I'm not.
[32:17.29]Any backup?
[32:18.10]Let me make sure there's nobody else there.
[32:21.40]He's currently... I'll tell you when he goes to the bathroom.
[32:25.98]He's currently standing over here.
[32:30.67]I'm not sure what he's doing.
[32:33.79]Let's go.
[32:34.49]Let's get behind him.
[32:36.59]No, I lost battery.
[32:38.21]Oh, well.
[32:39.31]All right, you interrogate him.
[32:40.81]All right, let's sneak in there.
[32:42.39]And I'll give you cover from above.
[32:45.46]He's kind of looking just straight over here.
[32:46.84]Can I throw a pebble over there or something to distract him?
[32:51.14]That is a different Ubisoft game.
[32:52.60]That's a different Ubisoft game.
[32:55.70]Maybe he won't even see me.
[32:57.80]I think he saw you.
[32:58.40]Why didn't you tag this guy?
[32:59.32]I didn't see that guy.
[33:01.32]You're the one without the drone.
[33:02.37]It's okay.
[33:03.89]All of his people are dead now.
[33:09.23]Got him.
[33:11.29]All right.
[33:11.69]Push him off the ledge.
[33:13.13]Oh, there's a bunch more people down there.
[33:14.87]Where?
[33:15.27]Where are they?
[33:16.62]They're down below.
[33:17.50]All right.
[33:19.26]Just... You... Don't worry.
[33:21.26]You answer my questions.
[33:22.38]Or I put a bullet in your gut and leave you to die on your own shit.
[33:25.02]You understand this?
[33:26.01]Chill the fuck out, cabrón.
[33:27.35]What do you want?
[33:27.95]Amaru, where can I find him?
[33:31.31]This looks like it's a part of my ghillie suit.
[33:36.73]I am so tempted to shoot him again.
[33:39.91]I'm wearing a tree as my ghillie suit.
[33:43.99]They were going to kill him anyway.
[33:45.29]Did he even give you any good intel?
[33:49.90]Yeah, I think he did.
[33:51.68]New.
[33:52.62]Right here, right?
[33:57.70]I couldn't even hear what the hell he was saying.
[33:59.00]No, here's one.
[33:59.90]Unknown location.
[34:03.02]I guess we'll go this way.
[34:05.68]Actually, no.
[34:06.04]There's a lot of new shit.
[34:07.82]Over here.
[34:08.16]Alright, I got my new spot.
[34:12.87]Get in the car.
[34:13.37]We'll get down there.
[34:16.55]Make the game a little louder?
[34:17.45]Yeah, I can.
[34:18.71]It's weird, though.
[34:20.55]The game audio is really silent.
[34:23.01]Yeah.
[34:23.81]And then it gets loud sometimes.
[34:25.51]Yeah, watch what happens when I shoot the gun.
[34:27.35]The game's really quiet, and then all of a sudden it's just like... Bang!
[34:31.07]See some more bikes over there.
[34:32.57]Got the bikes down there?
[34:33.85]I think so.
[34:34.13]There's at least one.
[34:35.57]Alright, maybe we can get on the same one.
[34:43.88]That's a kill.
[34:45.00]I got him.
[34:46.68]Tango down.
[34:47.32]Uh... I don't like this over the shoulder thing.
[34:54.88]What were those bikes?
[34:57.28]Alright, you drive.
[34:58.06]If we can get on the same bike, then you have to drive.
[35:02.03]There we go, right here.
[35:03.45]Give him some ammo.
[35:05.93]Nice.
[35:07.47]And then you're gonna take us to that place.
[35:09.89]Why is there a lazy chair here with a document on it?
[35:13.57]I don't know.
[35:15.89]What are you doing?
[35:23.90]I picked up the document.
[35:24.84]It was a collectible.
[35:25.74]Fucking fuck documents.
[35:27.66]You want me to drive?
[35:28.22]No way I'm letting you drive this thing.
[35:31.31]I can't even get on it.
[35:32.36]Game sucks.
[35:33.42]Are you sure?
[35:33.92]There's like definitely a seat there.
[35:35.92]Can't even get on it.
[35:37.36]Can't even get on it.
[35:38.40]Game sucks.
[35:41.18]Oh, well.
[35:41.66]Are you sure?
[35:42.76]Hang on.
[35:43.72]Can you get on mine?
[35:44.42]I couldn't get on yours.
[35:45.08]No.
[35:45.14]Yeah.
[35:51.78]Yeah.
[35:52.73]Yeah.
[35:53.23]Oh, well.
[35:53.83]All right.
[35:54.81]Where are we going next?
[35:56.33]We're going to take a right.
[35:59.59]And we're gonna, we're gonna go see 1.9.
[36:00.91]You're gonna be marked on your map.
[36:03.63]1.9?
[36:04.05]1.9.
[36:04.81]Are you going to the next story mission?
[36:06.67]Yeah.
[36:07.61]Oh.
[36:07.93]Let's go.
[36:08.31]Ready?
[36:08.85]Punch it, dude.
[36:10.07]Hold on.
[36:10.95]There's gotta be something else we can do.
[36:13.11]Hold on.
[36:15.47]Punching it!
[36:24.17]Is this guy's bike better than ours?
[36:25.51]There's a bunch of question marks.
[36:34.22]I don't think I can, like, road rage this guy off the road.
[36:41.12]Oh, I guess I can.
[36:49.84]What do you do?
[36:52.88]He threw himself off that bike, by the way.
[36:55.32]I didn't even do that.
[36:56.15]Alright, no, we're going the wrong way.
[37:00.17]Oh no, there's a bike on the road.
[37:04.67]I don't know how to go around it.
[37:07.25]What do I do about this?
[37:08.31]All right, this way.
[37:16.29]Off this ramp over here.
[37:23.85]Come on, where's the realism?
[37:25.75]Where's the realism?
[37:26.67]I don't stay on this bike.
[37:39.44]Um... Are you okay?
[37:50.20]Okay, come get me.
[37:53.26]Oh, you're down.
[37:55.02]I see.
[37:55.44]Wait, what?
[37:58.04]Are you okay?
[38:06.70]Are you gonna tell me what happened?
[38:09.60]Nothing, nothing.
[38:10.14]Don't worry.
[38:10.48]I'm okay.
[38:12.70]I just supermaned down the whole fucking mountain.
[38:16.36]I don't have a bike anymore.
[38:17.48]Is your bike gone?
[38:18.42]Yeah, it's gone.
[38:20.38]It'll be gone while I was getting a car.
[38:25.46]Okay.
[38:30.06]Just stop a car for me so I can get him one.
[38:34.03]Oh, man.
[38:35.81]Don't move!
[38:46.02]I'm okay.
[38:47.30]I'm okay.
[39:02.65]Ow.
[39:03.87]Ow, my fucking stomach.
[39:07.31]Aww.
[39:15.05]Look at these fucking idiots.
[39:17.27]What are you people doing?
[39:19.97]Oh my lord and fucking jeez.
[39:22.23]Ugh, alright, can I... Alright, get in the... It said trunk.
[39:31.28]Can I get in the trunk?
[39:33.56]Please tell me I can get in the trunk.
[39:35.70]Oh my god, I can get in the trunk.
[39:42.47]You gotta dump me.
[39:44.70]You gotta dump me in the fucking water.
[39:48.20]Why would you get in the trunk?
[39:50.80]Oh, here you go.
[39:51.24]You got a lot of space back here.
[39:52.60]I think I'll get in the trunk.
[39:58.34]This is not deep enough.
[40:03.27]I'm not playing the game for the rest of the time.
[40:05.63]This is what I'm doing from now on.
[40:06.77]I'm not playing the game anymore.
[40:09.08]Good luck.
[40:10.48]What the fuck was that?
[40:13.98]My guy doesn't even care.
[40:15.02]Okay, he's still sleeping in the back.
[40:18.02]We're on a road trip right now and the car is on fire.
[40:21.43]I'm still- okay.
[40:26.07]I'm still lying in the back.
[40:31.05]It's just fucking burning.
[40:33.05]It's burning in the river.
[40:38.93]You're okay.
[40:39.43]Yeah, I'm fine.
[40:40.13]Yeah, you're fine.
[40:41.37]I'm okay.
[40:41.81]I'm gonna be fine.
[40:45.27]Oh, maybe I'm dead.
[40:46.59]Have I figured that out yet?
[40:47.53]Okay, well... Where's the realism?
[40:56.88]Where's the realism?
[40:58.14]Oh, that was fun!
[40:59.42]Let's do that again sometime.
[41:02.64]I liked that trip.
[41:06.20]Ugh.
[41:08.84]That was seriously, that string of events right there was like fucking perfect, holy shit.
[41:15.04]I gotta get in another trunk.
[41:16.34]Like you have to, dude you have to, seriously.
[41:18.99]Fuck this whole game.
[41:19.97]Who gives a shit about this game?
[41:21.81]Like, this whole, who gives a fuck?
[41:24.35]We gotta get to the top of the mountain and you have to dump me off while I'm in the trunk.
[41:27.97]I wanna be sleeping in the back, like, what a prank you played on your friend.
[41:32.28]Oh hey shit, Jerma's sleeping in the back, don't wake him, we're gonna like dump him off a cliff while he's sleeping.
[41:38.10]We need a car.
[41:40.65]That has a trunk.
[41:48.14]I don't see any cars.
[41:51.26]I see some coming down this way.
[41:52.48]Follow me.
[41:54.44]I went the other way.
[41:55.48]I'm going to turn the brightness down a little now.
[41:59.47]Again.
[42:01.99]That hurt.
[42:02.73]That hurt a lot.
[42:03.45]My body hurts after that one.
[42:07.78]brightness like 38 gamma 40 come pick me up good fov okay I'm just doing some adjustments it's a little better all right random screaming lady that's fine oh there is fast travel there's the fast travel really yeah if you unlock those little supply points you can fast travel to them
[42:38.29]This used to be a no joke stream.
[42:43.98]True.
[42:44.24]Alright, hold on.
[42:49.19]There's a car coming.
[42:51.33]But we gotta get to the top of like a mountain, you know what I mean?
[42:54.25]Slow down.
[42:55.03]SLOW DOWN!
[42:57.80]Look, you just have to scare them and they'll dive out of the car.
[43:01.18]Well, yeah, wouldn't you if there was a guy with guns on the road shooting at you?
[43:04.80]I would keep driving the car.
[43:07.08]That's true.
[43:08.24]Okay, what are you talking about?
[43:09.88]Stay in the car.
[43:10.56]Maybe they just assume you want the car, so they're trying to appease you so you don't shoot them.
[43:15.12]Dude, it's like, if I'm scared, I'm just stepping on the gas.
[43:17.53]I'm not going to dive out Superman-style.
[43:21.75]I'm coming back to... What are these people doing?
[43:24.47]That's me.
[43:25.45]Okay, for a second, I was like, no fucking way, the AI just did that.
[43:29.96]Alright, get in the Subaru.
[43:33.12]Can you get in this trunk?
[43:34.44]Yeah, but I think it's funnier if it's a dumb soccer mom Subaru.
[43:40.07]Yep, here we go.
[43:40.63]Let's get in this trunk.
[43:43.47]No, but look at the back.
[43:45.39]Look at me, though.
[43:47.85]Okay, yeah, that is better.
[43:49.51]You're just sitting there like, oh, this is fun.
[43:54.69]Oh, nice.
[43:56.80]But I think I like sleeping better.
[43:59.60]Okay.
[44:00.10]Yeah, no, I like the sleeping better.
[44:02.56]Because it's like, I don't even know what's going on, you know what I mean?
[44:07.45]What are you doing?
[44:08.61]Are we both holding E?
[44:09.53]Yeah, we're both holding E. Because I'm Moonwalk.
[44:11.87]Ah, you beat me.
[44:12.63]That'd be so awesome if you could get into.
[44:18.52]Where even is the top of the mountain?
[44:20.20]Just find it.
[44:21.56]Just keep scaling up this thing.
[44:24.24]Let's see.
[44:25.20]Is there like a...
[44:28.56]I don't even know, it doesn't even matter.
[44:31.35]I'm gonna go this way.
[44:34.05]Yeah, that looks like you can get up there at the top there.
[44:40.03]I love this guy sleeping in the back thing.
[44:42.62]This is so perfect.
[44:47.88]Clown car trick.
[44:50.44]How many people could you fit?
[44:51.48]I bet if you had four or five people playing, you could sit one in each seat and the trunk.
[44:55.51]Yeah.
[44:58.27]Where's the rest of our squad?
[44:59.34]Isn't it supposed to be like an AI squad?
[45:00.96]Don't do anything crazy.
[45:01.70]Okay.
[45:02.82]I feel like I'm being pretty normal.
[45:07.20]People are saying it needs to be brightened up a little bit.
[45:09.86]Do I have a 144Hz monitor?
[45:15.75]No, I don't.
[45:17.97]If you take a look at this right side over here, that looks pretty dumpable, doesn't it?
[45:21.05]See that spot right there?
[45:24.05]Like over here?
[45:24.61]Yeah, that looks like a fairly dumpable spot.
[45:27.79]This is high, hang on.
[45:28.95]I feel like if we go back up to where we were shooting.
[45:31.87]Let me get out of here for a second.
[45:34.07]I wanna get rid of the windows.
[45:35.17]So it's easier to see.
[45:36.86]Hold on, stop moving.
[45:45.06]I can't get rid of the windows.
[45:46.28]These are bullet resistant.
[45:48.00]Bulletproof windows, got it.
[45:50.00]What is that?
[45:50.46]What's happening?
[45:53.48]I don't know, this guy.
[45:55.98]This guy's car is sick.
[45:58.10]That guy had, like, a monster truck.
[45:59.82]Oh, I'm not with you.
[46:00.65]Hold on.
[46:01.43]I know.
[46:01.63]I'm trying to catch him.
[46:05.73]That person's gonna get hit.
[46:06.41]That person's gonna get hit.
[46:08.29]He's faster than me.
[46:09.03]Oh, that was close.
[46:11.33]This person's gonna get railed.
[46:12.23]Oh, almost.
[46:16.90]This person's gonna get clipped.
[46:20.90]This person's head was going through the... Where are my binoculars?
[46:24.50]Oh, there they are.
[46:28.57]I just want someone to get hit so bad.
[46:30.09]There's people behind me.
[46:46.54]I did it!
[46:46.96]Sorry guys!
[46:48.25]Wow!
[46:57.59]Hi.
[46:58.13]I'm here.
[46:59.63]Sorry about that.
[47:00.37]What the fuck is going on?
[47:05.17]Can I get in this trunk?
[47:06.69]Can I get in this trunk?
[47:09.75]No, I can't.
[47:10.47]I can climb it.
[47:14.61]Can I lie in the bed of the truck?
[47:16.47]Just lie down in it?
[47:18.13]You probably will sit in the back to shoot.
[47:21.04]No, it's got to be in the trunk.
[47:22.56]We'll try to keep it that way.
[47:25.85]Can't get in that.
[47:26.29]You can only get in these like weird trunks.
[47:28.79]All right, you know what?
[47:29.75]Don't startle this person.
[47:31.09]This person right here.
[47:33.17]Is this person dead in this car?
[47:34.32]I can't even tell.
[47:35.88]God damn it.
[47:39.20]I wanted to get in their trunk.
[47:40.22]All right.
[47:42.28]We need to wait for... Wait for one of those cars to come down here.
[47:46.73]I want to get in their trunk.
[47:49.29]H. Oh, that's so much better.
[47:52.83]Uh, so maybe you won't spook them if you put your guns away or something?
[47:55.57]Yeah, because I want to get in somebody's trunk.
[48:03.32]Just gotta wait for them to spawn it.
[48:08.94]Can you ride on the back of this?
[48:10.02]Uh, I don't think so.
[48:12.17]I tried a couple times before.
[48:12.85]It's a different bike.
[48:15.53]No, it doesn't say I can.
[48:16.57]Oh.
[48:19.04]We need this thing to despawn.
[48:22.52]Try going to a different area where there's not, like, eight cars already.
[48:25.20]Hold on.
[48:28.77]Yeah, let's just, like, breathe, dude.
[48:30.69]Let's get, like, a new spot.
[48:35.83]I'm gonna go up, follow you.
[48:41.94]These people fly around this edge.
[48:43.76]I'm surprised nobody has thrown themselves off yet.
[48:46.10]Here's one.
[48:47.34]Alright, is it coming our way right now?
[48:49.68]It's coming up the hill.
[48:50.65]Okay, good.
[48:51.75]Don't startle them.
[48:52.31]Don't get scared of them.
[48:54.19]Not doing anything out of the ordinary.
[48:56.17]Just following them.
[48:58.33]Because there's one here, too.
[49:00.39]Alright, there's one.
[49:01.01]Yep.
[49:01.33]There's a little bit of a traffic jam here.
[49:04.21]Got it.
[49:04.71]Alright.
[49:05.79]When you move some of the stuff out of the way, right?
[49:09.01]Please, lady, don't freak out about this.
[49:12.03]Oh, god damn it.
[49:13.81]They won't let you.
[49:15.38]My turn.
[49:16.24]Your turn.
[49:31.19]Uh...
[49:34.39]Driving's hard in this game, oh my god.
[49:35.69]It is really, it is hard.
[49:37.95]Alright, dumpable spot.
[49:40.14]Gotta be like right over here.
[49:41.44]Yeah, that might be a good place to do it.
[49:43.04]Alright, send me on my vacation.
[49:56.45]You're still in the car.
[49:57.89]You're still in the car.
[49:59.91]Because I was trying to get a bigger drop.
[50:02.09]Also, jumping out in the middle of a jump is not really possible.
[50:05.74]It's okay.
[50:06.18]We're good.
[50:08.06]We're good.
[50:10.66]We're good.
[50:10.90]We're good.
[50:15.09]Just slowly driving down this hill.
[50:18.55]This isn't even bad.
[50:19.65]I feel like you haven't even gotten out of the car.
[50:24.17]No, I did.
[50:24.65]I know.
[50:26.35]Also, I'm deaf.
[50:31.21]Alright, we're still going.
[50:34.03]That joke did not work.
[50:35.37]No, not as planned.
[50:38.94]Hey!
[50:39.30]Wow, that was nice.
[50:40.72]I'm coming to get you.
[50:46.08]Uh, by the way,
[50:47.98]There's only 22 seconds, so I'd say don't bother, but by the way, you cannot exit a vehicle unless it's touching the ground.
[50:54.59]Really?
[50:55.89]So there's no, like, GTA mid-jump exit.
[50:59.61]Yeah, I ain't gonna get you.
[51:00.65]You too, you too.
[51:01.41]I can't do it.
[51:02.20]It's all right.
[51:04.36]I'll have my own fun.
[51:07.68]Look, I'll just have my own fun.
[51:20.00]There's two silhouettes.
[51:21.12]I didn't even see them.
[51:22.04]There were people there.
[51:23.06]They're dead.
[51:23.74]They're gone forever.
[51:26.52]Hey, you know those things people have in their front lawns?
[51:28.19]Slow down.
[51:29.21]What?
[51:31.99]Oh, there you are.
[51:32.81]Get in the trunk.
[51:34.59]I'm trying.
[51:39.57]This thing is beat up.
[51:40.91]Yeah, I just... Where's the realism?
[51:43.97]Moking in the front, too.
[51:44.93]You know what I'm saying?
[51:46.61]Where's the fucking realism?
[51:47.51]Alright, let's go.
[51:48.15]Let's go over here.
[51:50.90]Did you get that waypoint?
[51:52.46]Yeah, I mean, I'm having some trouble.
[51:54.18]I need to turn around.
[51:54.80]You're talking about the yellow waypoint, right?
[51:58.38]Yeah, we're like... No, no, no.
[51:59.72]We're so far away.
[52:02.87]I think we're stuck in this ditch now.
[52:04.33]Not the yellow one.
[52:06.05]Not the yellow one.
[52:07.49]Go to B. Go to B. Okay.
[52:13.05]B it is.
[52:13.49]I think this car is made out of paper.
[52:20.37]This is a paper car.
[52:22.23]It seems pretty sturdy to me considering what we're putting it through, honestly.
[52:26.48]See, this car should have exploded 25 minutes ago.
[52:32.71]This is a cartoon.
[52:34.99]Why are there people here?
[52:35.91]I've seen this on Saturday morning.
[52:37.25]This is like a joke cartoon.
[52:39.87]We see cartoon music here.
[52:41.15]There's a steam coming out of the car.
[52:46.90]There's not even smoke.
[52:53.73]This shouldn't be happening.
[52:55.21]We were just crashing into everything that you could possibly crash into.
[53:03.73]It'd be faster to run at this point.
[53:10.20]Why is this car still driving?
[53:13.74]Alright, I got an idea.
[53:14.72]Here, let me out here, and you start heading towards the story.
[53:18.40]Don't, hold on, wait, wait, we've changed the smoke.
[53:21.76]Alright, let me out.
[53:22.18]We're gonna get there, don't worry.
[53:22.96]You don't, no, no.
[53:23.38]No, no, no, turn around.
[53:24.02]No, just trust me, it's worth it.
[53:25.87]For a joke.
[53:26.37]What, what are we doing?
[53:27.47]You have to trust me.
[53:28.91]Alright.
[53:29.13]Start heading towards the, uh, story objective.
[53:30.91]The story objective.
[53:32.51]Yep.
[53:33.03]This, this one right here.
[53:36.21]The, uh, the yellow one.
[53:37.23]This yellow one, right in front of us.
[53:39.47]No, it's not, it's not right in front, it's on the other side of the map.
[53:42.63]What?
[53:44.52]You want me to go to the other side of the fucking map right now?
[53:47.44]Trust me.
[53:48.61]Trust me, he says.
[53:51.41]Okay.
[53:52.75]Heading there now.
[53:53.31]It's going to take a minute.
[53:56.53]It's going to take me... It's 3,000 miles away.
[53:59.07]It's 3,000 kilometers.
[54:03.48]It's 3 kilometers away.
[54:04.64]It's going to take a minute.
[54:09.54]Well, it's okay.
[54:09.96]I'll still be in the same car.
[54:10.78]Hold on.
[54:14.76]Don't worry.
[54:15.93]I won't be changing cars.
[54:25.63]Almost not quite there.
[54:27.13]Let's go this way now, up on the farmland.
[54:34.16]Upturned nose, other side of the map.
[54:35.88]Yeah, I know, right?
[54:39.56]Why are there so many people walking?
[54:40.66]That's a good question.
[54:56.95]I'm still in this car.
[54:59.70]I ain't getting out of it.
[55:01.38]I'm not going to get out of this car until the game forces me out of it.
[55:09.08]I know I can get up this.
[55:10.08]Come on.
[55:11.94]Punch it.
[55:13.08]Punch it.
[55:14.58]Punch it, you little shit.
[55:15.87]Come on.
[55:16.29]Let's go.
[55:18.47]Oh, God.
[55:20.01]Oh, my God.
[55:25.17]Come on!
[55:25.77]Go!
[55:26.14]Go through the swamp area!
[55:28.22]Nice, I get it.
[55:29.24]We're good.
[55:36.82]Still making my way to A. Let's go to A. A for effort.
[55:47.81]A for apple.
[55:52.17]A for awesome.
[55:56.19]A4.
[55:56.57]What the fuck are you doing?
[56:05.04]Where'd you get that?
[56:05.72]I want it.
[56:08.32]Let's go.
[56:08.80]Where'd you get that indeed?
[56:11.20]Get down here.
[56:11.99]I'm gonna get on the road and you gotta come get me.
[56:14.79]I need to get in there.
[56:15.87]I think I'm gonna crash it.
[56:17.09]Don't crash it.
[56:17.59]Don't crash it.
[56:18.03]We gotta get to flat ground.
[56:20.83]There's flat ground over here.
[56:22.15]There's like a road right here.
[56:25.34]You're shooting me right now.
[56:30.74]Oh god, nice.
[56:33.58]I can't believe it!
[56:35.57]Woo!
[56:36.15]Woo, that was a hard landing.
[56:38.21]Whatever, we're there.
[56:42.73]Oh, wow.
[56:42.95]Hold on.
[56:43.37]You know, you gotta check.
[56:44.29]You guys have to make sure.
[56:45.07]That he can't die on the blade?
[56:47.33]He's gotta check.
[56:48.41]Just tilt it off.
[56:49.15]Can you, like, tilt it forward?
[56:50.91]I'm gonna crash the whole plane.
[56:52.11]You're not gonna crash if you just tilt it forward.
[57:00.95]Come on, really?
[57:01.83]Where's the realism?
[57:04.17]Where's the realism, Ubisoft?
[57:05.81]Where's the real... Hold on, wait, I'm on the car.
[57:11.32]I'm on top of the car.
[57:11.94]I'm on top of the car.
[57:14.90]What the fuck, Ubisoft?
[57:16.72]Where's the realism?
[57:19.83]Okay, now... Not what you were hoping for, I gather.
[57:23.39]No.
[57:25.51]Now you have to come get me.
[57:29.76]You just planted your butt there.
[57:44.15]It's not my fault that they didn't give physics to the blades.
[57:47.50]What is that to the left?
[57:48.12]Do you see that?
[57:52.06]Excuse me, car.
[57:53.32]To the left.
[57:54.38]Just trying to get in.
[57:55.52]To the left.
[57:56.28]I was just trying to, like, get in.
[57:58.18]Oh.
[57:58.58]Helicopter tutorial.
[57:59.80]Okay.
[58:02.76]I mean, like, I'm just jumping out of this, right?
[58:05.04]That's, like, the joke?
[58:08.28]The joke was I was going to sneak up on you and shoot you, and I missed.
[58:12.39]And then... How do I get out of this view?
[58:13.83]The helicopter blades.
[58:14.79]How do I get out of, like... It's H, right?
[58:16.23]I can't do it.
[58:17.89]How do I go back to third person?
[58:22.05]Q?
[58:23.49]R?
[58:23.81]T?
[58:24.17]Like, how do I do it?
[58:25.87]I don't know.
[58:26.54]You tell me, Passive.
[58:27.72]You wanna fly?
[58:30.50]You can be the flyer.
[58:33.60]Go land down here.
[58:34.40]I just wanna get out of this stupid mode.
[58:39.77]Alright, I'm gonna land.
[58:44.19]Actually, you can get your own helicopter.
[58:45.77]Again?
[58:46.19]Nice.
[58:46.93]That works.
[58:50.83]I don't know why it keeps tilting the helicopter off.
[58:52.68]Oh, I see where it is.
[58:53.46]Alright, get me in a good spot.
[58:59.38]I see it.
[59:00.60]Right next to the farm.
[59:03.52]Alright.
[59:03.90]I can't even jump out.
[59:06.49]Wow.
[59:06.63]Where's the realism?
[59:07.57]Can't even jump out of the helicopter.
[59:09.35]Like, nice realism.
[59:19.91]This thing is so difficult to control.
[59:22.15]Is it?
[59:23.11]Yeah.
[59:24.87]I have no idea.
[59:27.39]What in the name of God?
[59:29.73]Hold on, shift?
[59:31.67]Pitch?
[59:33.50]This is like three times worse than GTA.
[59:35.12]Why is the A button pitch?
[59:36.36]That doesn't make any sense.
[59:37.22]How do you go down?
[59:39.90]I think control.
[59:41.34]Control.
[59:42.12]Oh my god, it is control.
[59:46.92]They fucking ruined it!
[59:48.52]What?
[59:48.98]No!
[59:49.86]What?
[59:50.78]What just happened?
[59:52.11]Oh my god.
[59:56.19]Oh, come on.
[59:57.41]No, that's such bullshit.
[60:02.29]They figured out how to go down.
[60:04.59]These fucking idiots.
[60:06.39]They shot us once.
[60:09.36]I think your helicopter got stuck on my helicopter.
[60:12.26]No, these guys shot us and it exploded.
[60:13.84]Oh, is that what happened?
[60:15.52]Yeah.
[60:17.12]All right, get in.
[60:23.11]Get on the bed.
[60:33.03]Nice, all right.
[60:34.91]No, that ain't gonna work.
[60:37.99]It ain't gonna work.
[60:39.25]Alright, get in, get in the car.
[60:40.21]Let's do a mission so we can level up.
[60:44.92]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do it!
[60:47.92]You monster!
[60:50.62]You fucking monster!
[60:54.08]Wow, Italic's a monster.
[60:55.87]Confirm.
[60:56.43]He's a fucking monster.
[61:03.49]Okay, let's do a mission.
[61:04.33]How do you level up?
[61:05.61]You hit M, then you go to skills.
[61:10.55]No pain.
[61:11.05]Stamina squad.
[61:11.93]Rebel support.
[61:12.71]Weapon.
[61:14.05]Grenade launcher.
[61:17.39]Drone.
[61:18.29]Item.
[61:18.91]Parachute.
[61:21.43]Oh.
[61:21.73]Parachute.
[61:22.29]There's a parachute.
[61:24.59]Okay, we got... Nice.
[61:26.78]Next level up, gotta get one of those.
[61:28.84]You have to have like five... What?
[61:31.18]How does this point system work?
[61:32.44]I have no idea.
[61:36.42]So let's go do this story mission.
[61:38.44]Let's get on the road and take a left.
[61:44.50]You have to drive, by the way.
[61:46.12]Hold on.
[61:46.54]Because I missed a bunch of subs, and I want to say hello to them.
[61:49.86]So you get to drive.
[61:50.54]Okay, hold on.
[62:00.82]This looks like you're a really bad hunter.
[62:04.60]You see my face up close?
[62:07.03]You have a mask on.
[62:08.93]Yeah, but I have a two-hole eye mask with an eye patch.
[62:13.96]You're a real badass.
[62:15.26]All right.
[62:15.96]I know.
[62:16.18]All right, I'm going to mute for a minute.
[62:20.22]Just take us to the objective.
[62:21.26]It's to the left.
[62:21.70]You know where it is.
[62:23.33]Oh, yes, sir.
[62:29.09]Anyways, in regards to subs, thank you, Red Ranger, for your two subscriptions in a row.
[62:34.63]Red Ranger 10, Ranger 11.
[62:35.49]No, Red Ranger 10 was for 11 months, and Red Ranger a...
[62:43.57]I'm trying to think what the hell I'm just saying.
[62:46.29]RedRanger10, thank you for the subs, though.
[62:48.75]You're the man.
[62:49.83]TheRoyalDuck, thank you for two months.
[62:51.93]Assertive, thank you for 12 months.
[62:53.73]Berkishman, thank you for 10 months.
[62:55.69]Paper, for four months.
[63:00.13]Mugton, thank you for the sub.
[63:01.91]RaySandwich, RavioliMammaMia for five months.
[63:04.41]SavvySultan for 12 months.
[63:07.13]ChildishBrendino for four months.
[63:09.69]It's been four months, what have I been doing with my life?
[63:11.91]Hopefully good things.
[63:13.93]Mr. DuckPlays, thank you for 11 months.
[63:17.05]Edowini, ColossalWaffle, SwissChills, thank you guys so much for your continued support.
[63:23.48]You guys are awesome.
[63:27.51]What have you found?
[63:28.65]What have you figured out?
[63:29.69]Found these guys.
[63:30.51]You found these guys.
[63:31.43]That... Hold on a minute.
[63:35.21]Bad guys.
[63:35.64]Corvette.
[63:36.46]That's a Corvette.
[63:37.38]Shoot them.
[63:38.52]Scare them.
[63:38.88]They're not going to get scared.
[63:40.44]They're bad guys.
[63:41.52]They're bad guys?
[63:42.12]What do you mean they're bad guys?
[63:43.70]They're literally the guys we're supposed to kill.
[63:47.04]I'm fucking dead again.
[63:49.66]Somebody grazed me with their car and I died.
[63:51.54]What?
[63:54.84]What, am I playing Frogger right now?
[63:59.58]Thanks to God.
[64:05.77]Well, back in the truck.
[64:11.33]Thank you, Custy, for the $2.50.
[64:12.39]My computer's finally working.
[64:14.17]I can cheer again.
[64:14.81]Well, thanks, dude.
[64:17.21]And Swiggity Stag, thank you for the $2.50.
[64:18.93]Do you remember my birthday's coming up and you wish me a happy birthday?
[64:21.71]We're here.
[64:22.59]We don't have to drive.
[64:23.35]Wish Swiggity Stag a happy birthday.
[64:26.09]Alex, please.
[64:28.22]Happy birthday.
[64:29.34]Swiggity.
[64:31.02]What was the rest?
[64:31.94]Swiggity Stag?
[64:32.80]Not Swiggity Swag?
[64:33.90]Swiggity Stag.
[64:35.38]All right.
[64:35.70]Easy, easy, easy.
[64:36.28]There's a helicopter in here, too.
[64:38.12]Yeah.
[64:38.36]This is where the story mission is.
[64:39.79]All right.
[64:40.03]We'll sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.
[64:43.65]You know what we're doing.
[64:45.90]I'm going to go tag everybody and we're going to steal the helicopter.
[64:48.78]That guy saw you.
[64:50.18]No, he didn't.
[64:50.76]Yes, he did.
[64:51.90]Look, he's coming over to shoot you, not me.
[64:54.90]Look, he's staring at you.
[64:56.62]He just shot the RC car out of the air.
[64:59.84]He's looking around for you.
[65:00.94]He's trying to find you.
[65:03.15]He shot you out of the air.
[65:05.13]What is this guy doing?
[65:05.87]Because I was right in front of his face.
[65:08.03]Hold on.
[65:08.49]I'm...
[65:16.99]Alright.
[65:17.85]You know what I'm doing.
[65:19.45]We have to rescue somebody?
[65:20.59]What are we doing?
[65:23.43]I'm going in.
[65:27.31]Alright, let's go.
[65:29.51]Take off, please.
[65:30.61]Take off, please.
[65:32.40]Take off, please.
[65:33.32]Alright, you know what?
[65:37.30]Throw grenades down there.
[65:38.74]I don't have any grenades.
[65:39.64]You don't have any grenades?
[65:40.36]I have grenades.
[65:40.80]I'll throw one.
[65:41.20]Can I throw one outside?
[65:43.64]Just shoot your minigun.
[65:44.58]Do you have a minigun?
[65:48.31]Alright, get in!
[65:50.17]Let's go!
[65:51.21]That's what I wanted.
[65:51.71]I wanted a fucking big diversion.
[65:53.35]Huge diversion.
[65:55.86]They're in here.
[66:00.80]Cover me.
[66:02.42]Let's go.
[66:02.66]Oh, this guy's real hurt.
[66:04.34]Wait, we have to... Uh-oh.
[66:13.10]It's an escort mission.
[66:14.66]Oh.
[66:15.88]Everyone's favorite game mode.
[66:17.88]Oh, it's an escort mission.
[66:19.92]Would have been nice to have that helicopter we just had.
[66:21.76]But, you know, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
[66:23.72]Let's make sure he's following one of us.
[66:31.23]Get him to follow you.
[66:32.85]No, he's following me.
[66:34.29]Run, run, run.
[66:37.01]Where's that Ferrari from earlier?
[66:39.05]I know, really.
[66:40.58]Let's go, man.
[66:41.24]We gotta go, we gotta go.
[66:45.10]I'm gonna put him in the trunk.
[66:48.36]Alright, I'm gonna get in the trunk.
[66:53.39]Whatever, you wanna drive?
[66:54.55]I can't get in this trunk.
[66:56.13]He can have the front seat.
[67:00.57]He's much cooler than me.
[67:03.17]Why is he not getting in?
[67:06.85]Okay.
[67:08.25]Okay.
[67:08.55]Let's go.
[67:08.97]Make sure you don't fuck this guy up.
[67:11.86]We only have to go 3,000 meters that way.
[67:14.98]We gotta just find a new helicopter.
[67:18.79]This guy is giving you the stink eye.
[67:20.59]You see this guy?
[67:21.65]We were clearly supposed to use the helicopter.
[67:24.65]Very clearly.
[67:28.09]Very clearly.
[67:30.00]How do you go first person in the car?
[67:31.42]I don't know, but you gotta be careful here.
[67:39.46]Easy.
[67:39.78]Watch out.
[67:40.06]We got nuns.
[67:40.66]Easy.
[67:43.06]This is the best car we could find?
[67:44.44]It kind of is.
[67:45.31]We're spec ops.
[67:46.69]We're America's elite.
[67:48.05]Yeah, we are the most elite counterterrorism unit.
[67:51.79]We drive a Honda Civic.
[67:55.07]This is like a Mitsubishi.
[67:58.21]Don't run these people over.
[67:59.13]They're just hanging out.
[67:59.85]They're fine.
[68:00.60]The people were fine.
[68:04.54]Three kilometers is too mild.
[68:05.36]We're still two and a half kilometers away, though.
[68:08.24]Seat change?
[68:08.80]Oh, I can change my seat.
[68:09.80]Look it.
[68:10.68]Are you sure you don't want to drive, so you're actually doing something?
[68:13.24]I mean, I could drive if you wanted to.
[68:15.14]You could have this.
[68:16.10]Those people just jumped off the cliff.
[68:19.79]All right, let me drive.
[68:22.29]Let me drive.
[68:26.25]You don't have to copy everything I do man, you don't have to do you're already so injured you're like why would you do that?
[68:39.98]Are you fucking out of your mind?
[68:41.06]All right, I'm going in here
[68:53.69]I'm the driver now.
[68:57.74]Is he actually going to get in?
[68:58.50]Alright, he's in.
[69:05.42]Now don't you dive out because he'll dive out.
[69:08.05]I'm so much worse at the driver than you.
[69:09.31]It's insane.
[69:11.29]You're like the Kool-Aid man anytime you burst through a window.
[69:14.56]I'm going to have to turn the brightness back up too.
[69:16.76]It's getting to be night time.
[69:18.16]Oh, it's almost night time.
[69:19.74]Oh well.
[69:22.02]Well, we have night vision goggles.
[69:23.87]It's going to be green screen.
[69:26.35]This is such a dangerous move.
[69:27.35]What am I doing?
[69:28.89]You almost killed me.
[69:29.75]Just play it safe.
[69:30.61]There's no reason to be that much of a crazy person.
[69:34.90]Everyone's telling me to jump off.
[69:35.88]No.
[69:36.78]This mission was a little too long and too far out of the way.
[69:40.71]Got the police.
[69:41.09]Just passed you on the road for going too slow.
[69:42.97]Whoa!
[69:43.61]Why is he going so fast?
[69:45.59]What was that all about?
[69:46.65]Yeah.
[69:47.99]Road rage.
[69:48.85]He's fucking stepping on the gas.
[69:52.86]He's gonna go off the cliff.
[69:54.46]If he's not careful.
[70:08.54]Almost there.
[70:09.10]I can't wait to dump this guy so we don't have to deal with him anymore.
[70:14.94]You know, part of me... Part of me wants to dump you guys off the cliff.
[70:18.32]Like, part of me does.
[70:19.08]There's a little portion of me that wants to dump you guys over the edge.
[70:23.96]But, yeah, I just... I'm not gonna do it.
[70:26.28]I'm not gonna do it.
[70:26.94]I just wanted to... I keep... It's fighting internally.
[70:33.04]It's an internal fight.
[70:37.31]Any good movies lately?
[70:41.31]This car would not be able to do that, by the way.
[70:44.14]We just tipped over a... You trying to hit these people?
[70:49.48]We gotta go that way.
[70:52.90]Oh, gosh.
[70:53.72]We have to go.
[70:54.70]Look at how much road we would have to go on.
[70:56.20]We're fine.
[70:56.94]Don't you know cars can't take damage in this game?
[71:00.40]You know that to be true.
[71:01.74]You watch me with a Subaru fucking Outback drive for ten straight minutes running over everything.
[71:09.05]We gotta go that way.
[71:09.63]You're gonna fail the mission by killing so many civilians.
[71:11.51]I'm not gonna fail the mission.
[71:12.23]No one's gonna die.
[71:12.97]Everyone's gonna be fine.
[71:16.56]This car is gonna be fine.
[71:17.34]How do you get out of this view?
[71:19.06]That's what I was trying to figure out too.
[71:19.92]I couldn't figure that out.
[71:23.23]Alright, you're this guy in the passenger seat, aren't you kind of like, hey dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[71:26.33]The car is smoking now.
[71:28.71]This guy's just like, totally okay with this?
[71:31.41]This is alright, yeah.
[71:32.71]Pretty good ride you got going on here.
[71:34.44]This ain't like totally fucked up or anything.
[71:39.14]Yeah, this is way faster than the road.
[71:43.18]Good thing we didn't just stay on the road.
[71:44.72]Hey, whoa, easy.
[71:45.86]Easy, that guy just kind of...
[71:50.33]He got out.
[71:52.73]He's just standing on top now.
[71:56.29]Come on.
[71:56.71]Follow me, buddy.
[71:58.17]He's not gonna follow you.
[71:59.11]He's gonna follow me.
[72:01.99]See, look.
[72:02.31]I'll get out.
[72:03.77]Now he's gonna listen to me.
[72:07.01]He's doing something weird.
[72:11.09]There's a road right here.
[72:11.93]Don't worry.
[72:14.25]It's just a bunch of dirt with no cars on it.
[72:18.11]Now we gotta walk the rest of the way.
[72:21.56]And worse, it won't tell you where you're supposed to go unless you're in a car.
[72:35.63]Hold on.
[72:38.33]All right.
[72:40.81]Pull up.
[72:42.73]Did I see that Kim was here?
[72:44.04]I didn't even see.
[72:45.88]If she's still here, hi, Kim.
[72:47.96]If you're gone, then I'll talk to you later.
[72:55.01]At least it's still falling.
[72:56.07]It's time to turn the brightness back up.
[72:58.05]I'm just going to turn my night vision goggles on.
[73:00.75]That's so ugly.
[73:01.49]I hate that, though.
[73:04.23]Where's the realism?
[73:05.03]I don't know where's the realism, but it's just... I would rather it look like DayZ than have to deal with ugly night vision.
[73:13.22]That's a fact.
[73:15.42]DayZ was really dark, if you don't remember.
[73:17.26]Yeah, but it looked kind of like this.
[73:24.55]Got 800 meters to run.
[73:28.83]This poor guy is already injured.
[73:36.20]Oh, God.
[73:36.76]Don't shoot him.
[73:39.08]It just shot up in the air.
[73:41.20]We can actually run this.
[73:42.14]This is okay.
[73:43.06]We're 600 meters away.
[73:44.62]We need a countdown.
[73:45.46]We'll be fine.
[73:47.28]We need a helicopter, though, we need.
[73:52.88]We can't get too far away.
[73:54.20]He's 80 meters away.
[73:56.16]We're making this guy run and he's so fucking injured.
[74:03.06]This guy must hate us.
[74:05.65]This is after we threw him down a mountainside in a hatchback.
[74:10.73]Yeah.
[74:13.71]Blew up a helicopter right outside of the base.
[74:16.55]Can't wait until Kim beats me in Smash Bros.
[74:18.47]It's probably going to happen.
[74:19.77]I wouldn't be surprised.
[74:23.04]I wouldn't be surprised.
[74:24.85]Alright, we actually have a game to play up here.
[74:27.47]We do.
[74:27.71]Do we have to, like, protect this guy?
[74:29.91]Uh, there's baddies up ahead.
[74:31.53]Alright, well, you take care of them, because I'm... I'm gonna make sure he stays alive.
[74:40.65]Is there a car up there?
[74:42.69]Uh, there is a helicopter up here, but... Well, he's following me, so you want to just go up there and take him out, or do you want me to do it?
[74:52.52]I can go, I'm just... There's only one guy that I can find.
[74:55.26]I just told him to stop.
[74:56.03]He's gonna stay here.
[74:57.11]So let's... Let's get up there and cause some problems, you know?
[75:02.13]We got bad guys.
[75:03.65]I love how they say we have bad guys.
[75:06.95]So he's just hanging out down there.
[75:10.83]Yeah.
[75:13.17]Hopefully we don't, like, lose signal with him and he just disappears and we have to start the mission over.
[75:17.47]You see that?
[75:18.21]Speaking of that shot, how do you get, like, other guns?
[75:20.74]I don't know.
[75:21.02]Like, snipers.
[75:24.79]Kind of game you could just get a silent sniper rifle and just win Do that shot it's pretty sick what took me about 15 that I think that's it we can call him back up here Hey you fetch him I'll go get him You just oh no no oh
[75:49.57]Okay.
[75:50.05]Did you throw a grenade at him?
[75:51.35]Ubisoft, let me ask you a question, Ubisoft.
[75:52.97]Ubisoft, if you're listening.
[75:54.33]I know, like, there's rebinding and shit, but H is to put your gun away, and G is grenade, and I just hit G by accident.
[76:00.07]I almost just threw a fucking grenade down at this guy.
[76:03.24]Almost.
[76:07.20]That was very close.
[76:15.58]There, he's coming.
[76:16.38]You got a helicopter for us?
[76:18.12]Standing by.
[76:18.78]Alright, nice.
[76:19.66]Hopefully he can climb.
[76:20.68]Waiting for extraction.
[76:24.80]Is this dumb AI going to be able to get over here?
[76:27.16]I think it is.
[76:30.09]Hey, he's coming.
[76:33.93]Ubisoft, listen.
[76:34.89]I'm fucking stupid.
[76:38.41]Where is he going?
[76:39.67]There he is.
[76:40.07]Alright.
[76:41.17]Come on, this way.
[76:41.89]This way, this way, this way.
[76:42.61]This way, this way, this way.
[76:43.35]This way, this way, this way.
[76:47.34]here we are hey look at who's here our injured fight guy don't freak out oh there's a patrol coming what do you mean there's a patrol there's like an enemy patrol coming we're gonna be long gone by then this will save us so much time this is gonna save us a million years by the way how come holding w tilts the helicopter backward
[77:19.09]Don't ask me why.
[77:19.81]That doesn't seem like a great idea.
[77:23.83]Alright.
[77:24.07]I'll re-infest people down there.
[77:26.98]There's people.
[77:27.56]We can't lose this right now.
[77:28.80]I'm gonna... Where are you taking us?
[77:33.00]We gotta drop them off there.
[77:34.44]Yeah, but there's people down there.
[77:35.90]So, okay.
[77:36.86]So land over here.
[77:37.60]No, wait.
[77:38.04]Hold on.
[77:40.52]You, like, shoot them from there?
[77:43.28]I think I did it.
[77:44.62]No, I didn't.
[77:46.94]Well, I mean, you're driving around all over the place.
[77:48.46]This guy can't aim for shit.
[77:50.04]Okay, well, you know what?
[77:51.34]You can fly a helicopter next time.
[77:52.86]No, I don't have any more grenades.
[77:53.71]I accidentally used the grenade.
[77:57.39]Alright, here's what we're gonna do.
[77:58.23]Land.
[77:59.33]Land, like, right now.
[78:00.37]Go.
[78:02.91]Land, land, land, land, land, land, land, land, land, land.
[78:04.85]Alright, go.
[78:06.17]I'll take care of this.
[78:09.87]You physically can't land any softer than that.
[78:12.93]Where the hell did they go?
[78:16.95]I don't know.
[78:17.83]What?
[78:18.17]Maybe I killed them with the Gatling gun, maybe.
[78:20.53]No, no way.
[78:21.57]They just left.
[78:22.99]That's them up there.
[78:23.63]What do you mean, no way?
[78:24.53]They left.
[78:25.64]They didn't care anymore.
[78:26.66]Hey, can you activate this thing?
[78:29.38]I got eyes on a weapons case.
[78:32.04]Take equipment.
[78:33.76]I guess I can.
[78:34.22]I got a new gun.
[78:35.38]Ooh, that's a weapon.
[78:37.68]Sniper.
[78:38.92]Oh, I want the sniper.
[78:40.12]It's not a sniper.
[78:41.31]It's like a... Oh, it's a sniper.
[78:43.33]Yeah, but it's got like a short scope.
[78:45.53]Let's test it out.
[78:49.51]Some guys to test it out on right here.
[78:50.75]There's probably a zoom, isn't there?
[78:54.25]I would assume, right?
[78:56.75]You probably changed scopes.
[78:58.53]That guy scared that guy.
[79:00.77]No, I didn't hit him.
[79:09.59]He just ate my son.
[79:11.11]This game is bad.
[79:12.11]I was going to say, no.
[79:13.21]This gun is bad.
[79:15.21]It seems okay.
[79:15.91]I like it.
[79:20.22]Is this guy gonna do anything?
[79:21.48]Like, get in the house.
[79:24.90]Do you have a cutscene?
[79:26.90]I do now.
[79:28.60]Are you hurt?
[79:29.26]Story.
[79:30.74]Lore.
[79:31.04]Yeah, enjoy the story, guys.
[79:33.04]I just kept it.
[79:39.70]Let us see.
[79:41.40]Their talk of love was enough to make me vomit.
[79:45.16]But their methods were not...
[79:47.90]Remember guys, pay attention.
[80:03.19]Pay attention to this ship.
[80:03.97]Are you watching the whole thing?
[80:04.85]Wait, we can... That's what I was wondering.
[80:20.97]I'm sitting here, like, just, like, paying attention.
[80:23.97]Oh, God.
[80:24.55]That was great.
[80:26.07]You're like, are you gonna watch this whole thing?
[80:27.73]Yeah, it's just, you know, standing outside in the rain, just, you know.
[80:33.19]Okay, we gotta go to the rally point.
[80:34.49]Whittling my thumbs.
[80:35.77]Where's the rally point?
[80:36.61]Um... I mean, there's... Okay, we can go to question marks.
[80:38.95]Or we can go to...
[80:50.81]um loot boxes skill point boxes I guess there's dory intel on the east unknown story in the southwest let's go get them I don't know let's do this major intel over here right let's go this way up there top right city yeah there's like a there's like a city over there somebody's screaming when did it what what happened to the weather
[81:17.01]It got stormy outside after that.
[81:18.41]I heard somebody just start screaming and I come back and it's like fucking lightning.
[81:21.71]Ooh, I leveled up.
[81:22.27]You know what that means, parachute.
[81:24.05]Level up.
[81:26.43]I don't have enough for the parachute.
[81:30.27]I don't understand what you need for it.
[81:31.95]It looks like you have to have... 550.
[81:33.53]Okay.
[81:34.87]So you know those little things we interact with on the missions where it's like, oh, it's 50.
[81:39.10]You have to do that X number of times before you can get a parachute, I guess.
[81:43.32]Okay.
[81:43.54]I guess.
[81:44.60]I guess.
[81:46.52]I don't know if that makes any sense, but that's the way it is.
[81:49.47]I guess.
[81:50.13]Whatever.
[81:52.59]Thank you, Phelpsie97 for 12 months.
[81:53.81]There's an ability that makes all... Oh, never mind.
[81:56.45]It's for AI.
[81:57.63]Wow, that long.
[81:58.27]Yeah, it is long.
[81:58.79]Thanks for the 12 months, dude.
[81:59.65]Fooper.
[82:00.48]Booper for two months.
[82:01.08]For the lonely people out there that just play by themselves.
[82:03.62]CoolFard.
[82:04.58]DiscoGypsyFish for eight months.
[82:06.86]It's just your desktop.
[82:08.34]There's nothing on it.
[82:10.16]Thanks for the eight months, though, dude.
[82:11.22]Naduri for four months.
[82:13.12]And JoeOfShow520 for four months.
[82:15.74]PattyCan for four months.
[82:16.82]LittlePompano for five months.
[82:19.21]Good luck, guys.
[82:22.47]Thanks a lot.
[82:24.84]You guys rock.
[82:26.24]Sorry, I was moving.
[82:30.66]Whoa.
[82:32.11]Hello.
[82:33.13]What happened?
[82:36.50]Do you want to fly?
[82:38.78]No, that's a bad idea.
[82:40.22]You fly.
[82:40.68]I drove my bike through the helicopter.
[82:44.64]That was weird.
[82:45.88]My bike is inside.
[82:47.40]It was?
[82:50.08]Okay, so I figured out what the problem is with the chopper.
[82:53.64]The helicopter commands are made with controllers in mind, right?
[82:56.97]So if you were hitting left trigger to go down, you could choose how hard you want to hit the left trigger.
[83:02.61]But now it's binary, right?
[83:03.99]So control, hitting control to go down is the maximum speed you can go down.
[83:08.91]That's true.
[83:09.77]That's why you slammed into the ground.
[83:14.94]That's what I'm talking about.
[83:16.12]Do you hear that?
[83:16.72]Somebody's screaming.
[83:17.46]I heard them scream.
[83:18.66]Also, I'm about to run into trees.
[83:21.38]I'm holding shift to go up and nothing's happening.
[83:25.64]What the fuck is the realism?
[83:31.13]I wish they would have made the helicopters at least, like, battlefield, I guess.
[83:35.55]All right, we're close.
[83:41.13]It's a pretty large settlement over here.
[83:45.37]A bunch of... Those flashes of lightning.
[83:47.87]It's like somebody's turning on a spotlight.
[83:54.43]You probably shouldn't land, like, right here.
[83:58.51]Right in the middle of the town.
[83:59.49]Alright, well, if you're going to do that, then I'm just going to go in the building.
[84:01.39]Land in the building.
[84:03.41]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[84:05.43]You know what?
[84:05.87]I can't get out.
[84:07.50]I came out.
[84:08.78]Get in the intel.
[84:12.70]In and out.
[84:13.06]Get in the intel.
[84:15.96]Where is it?
[84:16.22]I actually got a kill with this thing.
[84:22.17]Intel.
[84:22.35]Intel.
[84:24.61]Right there.
[84:25.21]Alright, you ready?
[84:25.91]Ready for extraction?
[84:27.91]We're doing in and out extraction.
[84:32.05]I took a picture of it with my cell phone.
[84:35.29]Okay?
[84:36.05]I'm under fire.
[84:37.49]Gonna take some food.
[84:39.65]No, can't do anything.
[84:40.37]Go.
[84:42.79]Alright, come get me.
[84:45.17]This is like automatic machine gun fire shooting at me.
[84:48.90]Alright, coming in.
[84:50.54]That was a fucking civilian.
[84:52.12]No!
[84:54.14]I'm like behind you.
[84:55.78]Oh, I'm trying.
[84:56.56]No.
[84:57.14]Oh boy.
[84:58.38]You gotta save me.
[84:59.80]Oh boy.
[85:00.06]You gotta help me.
[85:02.02]Come on, you can do it.
[85:02.63]There's a guy right in front of you.
[85:06.75]He's like right over here behind like the concrete slabs.
[85:17.26]Got him.
[85:17.90]Look at this tier one operator skill.
[85:20.26]What does that mean?
[85:22.94]We're tier one, man.
[85:26.07]Alright, back in the helicopter.
[85:31.83]Boom.
[85:33.81]Is every mission gonna be this easy?
[85:35.41]Extraction.
[85:36.39]We're out.
[85:38.68]That dude on his bike was getting groceries.
[85:41.70]Where are we supposed to be?
[85:42.80]Alright, we have... We gotta go get this intel.
[85:48.58]Dad, do you see where that intel is?
[85:51.79]Wait, why?
[85:52.77]You are like completely upside down.
[85:54.41]What are you doing?
[85:57.81]I can't go up or slow down.
[86:00.17]Alright, well, you're gonna have to drive us into a fucking wall.
[86:06.10]It's just going this speed.
[86:07.24]I'm stuck going this speed.
[86:08.18]That's okay.
[86:08.66]Just drive us straight there and I'll get out and extract.
[86:11.95]Alright, extraction.
[86:13.19]Go.
[86:16.43]We might explode as soon as we touch the ground.
[86:18.31]Just smash down on these guys.
[86:19.72]Just crash down on these guys.
[86:21.90]Can't even see them.
[86:23.04]See these three bad guys?
[86:23.94]Under the light?
[86:24.68]Yep, under the light.
[86:25.58]Those are our guys, aren't they?
[86:27.32]I think those are bad guys.
[86:28.00]Look, I see they're shooting.
[86:28.60]Just crush them!
[86:29.86]All right, give me the intel.
[86:34.54]You have fucking intel.
[86:39.76]Open the door!
[86:41.42]Open the door!
[86:47.33]I was trying to do that.
[86:48.97]Why did that not work for me?
[86:50.09]Why did that not work for me?
[86:55.15]I got the intel.
[86:56.27]Help me.
[86:56.91]Help me.
[86:57.91]Help me.
[86:59.63]Oh, you're down?
[87:00.51]Yes, I'm at the door.
[87:01.44]Oh.
[87:03.39]Did you get the intel?
[87:04.19]Why am I pushing you down the stairs?
[87:06.39]All right.
[87:10.35]There's a Winnipeg over here.
[87:11.25]I was moonwalking you.
[87:12.15]You got it?
[87:13.01]There's a green thing in here we need.
[87:14.55]Wait.
[87:14.71]It was a green thing.
[87:16.22]Yeah.
[87:16.42]This is the thing I was talking about.
[87:17.70]Remember where you take their supplies and then you level up the thing.
[87:23.14]Okay.
[87:23.52]We got some skill points.
[87:24.24]Don't worry about it later.
[87:25.04]We got some more skill points in here.
[87:29.42]Got it.
[87:30.14]All right.
[87:30.56]What's this?
[87:33.14]Get some ammo.
[87:34.60]I hear a lot of noises out there.
[87:35.52]What's going on out there?
[87:36.34]Talk to me.
[87:37.08]Covering you.
[87:37.66]Covering you.
[87:38.60]What's going on?
[87:39.04]I hear all kinds of noise out there.
[87:40.32]Talk to me.
[87:41.04]Alright, let's go.
[87:43.88]Out.
[87:44.94]There's a new helicopter for us.
[87:46.72]Good.
[87:47.20]Alright, I'll take this one.
[87:48.04]I'll drive.
[87:50.14]Can we leave?
[87:50.82]Can you get out?
[87:51.65]Can we get out of the fucking door?
[87:58.29]Get in.
[87:59.73]Sure are a lot of lights and switches up here.
[88:02.40]Probably should have got on the side, but that's okay.
[88:04.20]All right, what's next?
[88:04.76]Can you tag it for me?
[88:08.72]There's a convoy.
[88:09.40]Convoy.
[88:10.14]Got it.
[88:11.48]Okay, so, like, let him go forward and then hang back and then shoot him with the gatling gun or land right on top of him.
[88:19.41]Get the convoy!
[88:21.19]You're shooting the concrete.
[88:24.35]You're shooting the concrete directly in front of him.
[88:29.78]Holy shit, this is so fucking hard to drive.
[88:31.92]This is not possible to drive.
[88:35.30]Seriously.
[88:35.92]Uh-oh.
[88:40.06]We're gonna get this convoy.
[88:41.10]Oh, you almost got him.
[88:43.88]Got it.
[88:44.30]You were there.
[88:45.50]It's dead.
[88:46.90]It's dead.
[88:47.32]It's like it's a fucking living thing.
[88:51.96]That's probably some bird or something you're shooting right now.
[88:59.16]Talix, this doesn't make any sense.
[89:03.19]This is the worst helicopter controls of any video game.
[89:08.07]Oh, this is the worst controls on PC for a helicopter I've ever played in my life.
[89:13.07]Holy shit.
[89:16.77]What do you mean return to area of operations?
[89:18.43]What the fuck are they talking about?
[89:20.39]Wait, this car is on fire.
[89:21.87]What do you mean we're outside of the beta zone?
[89:27.56]No!
[89:28.88]Get out quick!
[89:34.76]Convoy got away.
[89:35.58]I said I died.
[89:37.69]Yeah, I haven't killed in action.
[89:43.11]What?
[89:44.79]If you get outside the beta zone, you die.
[89:46.49]Are you fucking serious?
[89:51.24]Yep.
[89:52.32]So, join... I guess... We're still on this mission?
[89:55.57]Is that what... Yeah, okay, good.
[89:57.19]We're still on this mission.
[89:58.25]We can keep going.
[90:01.47]No, this is different.
[90:04.79]This is different, right?
[90:06.53]Um... I can't see anything, so it's hard to say.
[90:10.11]Well, we'll just reach FOB.
[90:12.20]There's a plane!
[90:13.22]What?
[90:14.38]There's a plane flying in the air!
[90:15.76]Are you kidding me?
[90:18.20]Look on your... Open your map with him.
[90:20.80]oh boy oh boy look a bottom left of buena vida yeah I see that I see that I don't think we're gonna catch up to that though no I mean it's flying so of course not but uh well let's just get on the road somebody will eventually have to come land over here right are you having audio issues too
[90:43.89]no not necessarily I mean the game the game is really right now specifically like now not in general but right now it sounds like I am close to death I guess everything is kind of muted and tunnel-y and distant yeah I've my uh we could scare these guys yeah mine is too that's weird what's going on
[91:17.38]That's very strange.
[91:19.10]Yeah.
[91:19.32]Still doing it.
[91:22.27]Yeah, still doing it.
[91:23.09]We're underwater right now.
[91:24.05]Why are we... What's going on here?
[91:27.73]Somebody said if you want to fix the muted thing, you gotta throw a grenade on yourself and get revived, apparently.
[91:34.98]So, let's see what happens.
[91:35.76]Okay, come get me.
[91:40.46]And then you guys are gonna do the same thing.
[91:44.46]What did you just do?
[91:45.12]What did you just do?
[91:49.16]I threw a grenade too.
[91:51.22]Hold on.
[91:51.50]Give me one second.
[91:52.22]I gotta take a phone call.
[91:53.40]One second.
[91:54.72]Entertain them.
[91:55.38]Entertain the metallics.
[91:56.14]No.
[91:56.90]They can't.
[91:57.83]They expect too much.
[92:01.25]They can never be appeased.
[92:02.87]Mute your microphone, Jerma.
[92:09.49]Guys.
[92:11.37]Look.
[92:12.41]Look, I want to talk to you one-on-one right now.
[92:16.57]There's no telling how long this phone call is going to be.
[92:20.09]There's no telling how important it actually is.
[92:23.22]But if it was taken during a stream, you have to assume that we got hot stock.
[92:30.92]Dance for us, italics.
[92:32.63]Okay.
[92:35.87]Your wish is my command.
[92:41.09]Boo!
[92:42.71]Boo!
[92:44.86]We gotta listen to this guy right now?
[92:48.71]I don't pay this guy money every month!
[92:52.91]I want the guy that I pay money every month to to come back!
[92:59.02]You know what?
[92:59.42]I'm just gonna leave.
[93:01.28]I don't have to deal with this.
[93:20.17]Yeah, how do you like that silence?
[93:21.77]Make you feel better about yourself, chat?
[93:24.51]Do you feel like you're above me now?
[93:28.95]Do you feel more important because you have a name that's green and blue and purple?
[93:35.47]And you sometimes pose little German Jupiters?
[93:38.37]You feel good now?
[93:44.72]That's what I thought.
[93:48.41]Now, if you'll excuse me, I got five seconds until I can revive because a truck just ran me over.
[93:52.92]I'm back.
[94:01.38]See, I'm here.
[94:03.38]Now, what do you want from me?
[94:05.30]Hmm?
[94:07.97]Whatever it is, I can't give it to you.
[94:09.85]And you know what?
[94:10.91]I don't think there's anybody who can.
[94:14.03]Because they could give it to you.
[94:15.95]Well, where are they, huh?
[94:18.46]That's right, nobody's there.
[94:21.60]None of you are there.
[94:23.16]I've just been talking to myself this whole time.
[94:26.62]Alright, seriously?
[94:43.16]Seriously, Jerma?
[94:57.97]Wait...
[94:58.69]WHAT?! !
[95:41.06]Okay, that's all I got.
[95:42.38]Hope you were entertained.
[95:44.32]I really hope that did something for you.
[95:48.80]But you gotta face the facts.
[95:49.84]You gotta face the music right now.
[95:51.04]Is this a podcast?
[95:53.35]No.
[95:53.79]It's not a podcast.
[95:54.57]It's a Twitch stream.
[95:56.55]If it were a podcast, you know, which it's not, then you would expect to only have to listen to someone and not be able to see what they're doing at all times, you know?
[96:05.17]Right now, I've been kind of gimped.
[96:07.13]You know, got the short end of the stick.
[96:09.97]You can hear me, but you can't see me.
[96:11.73]So... Maybe I do suck.
[96:16.03]Maybe I do.
[96:19.31]Maybe you're right.
[96:23.00]Maybe everything I've been told has just been a lie.
[96:28.90]Maybe this podcast really does suck.
[96:33.79]I was going to look for a helicopter and bring it back around, but yeah, I can't find one.
[96:42.99]You know, I just want, I just want you all to divert your rage appropriately, you know, send it through the correct avenues.
[96:51.23]Think about why you're here right now.
[96:54.06]Think about, is it my fault that you're here stuck staring at an idle screen right now?
[96:58.20]Is that my fault?
[96:59.78]No.
[97:01.14]No, so think about who's not here and direct your anger, you know, to the correct channels.
[97:10.61]That's all I'm saying.
[97:17.20]Playing the blame game right now.
[97:31.00]Play the blame game.
[97:35.45]There was no phone call.
[97:37.77]That was just an excuse.
[97:41.67]Probably pooped your pants.
[97:45.40]Told me about the last time he pooped his pants.
[97:49.20]Like a week ago, I guess.
[97:52.50]I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
[97:55.93]Sorry.
[97:57.70]Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[98:00.14]We're good.
[98:01.09]I don't believe you.
[98:02.53]Are you really sorry?
[98:03.99]Have you been entertaining them like I requested?
[98:07.41]I played the blame game.
[98:08.31]Hold on, what does Mr. Sark have to say?
[98:09.61]If Mr. Sark is bad and like bad mad about this, then I'm going to feel really bad about it.
[98:18.36]Is Sark still here?
[98:19.40]Mr. Sark, I need your opinion.
[98:20.98]Does streamers suck?
[98:24.76]I've managed to divert all of the anger from me to you.
[98:27.93]Guns down.
[98:28.41]We don't need to frighten these people.
[98:35.95]Oh, come on.
[98:36.81]Oh, well.
[98:39.26]Oh, well.
[98:41.28]All right, let's do it.
[98:42.54]We keep going this way, right?
[98:46.10]Fuck a lot of people.
[98:47.86]Streamer sucks.
[98:57.39]Sark is a very kind person with honest opinions.
[99:00.61]He is.
[99:01.15]He is.
[99:01.77]Hey, that plane you were talking about is, like, right there.
[99:05.33]Right?
[99:05.71]Oh, uh... There's a helicopter right there.
[99:09.58]I don't see the plane anymore.
[99:12.80]There's a plane right there, dude.
[99:15.52]I think we just... Yeah, there's a plane over there.
[99:18.04]We're going to get that plane.
[99:20.66]If I was... Oh, my God.
[99:21.62]If I wasn't so bad at everything...
[99:24.80]If I wasn't so bad, we could... Have you noticed anything about your car yet?
[99:29.05]What's wrong with the car?
[99:30.65]Have you noticed you might... You're struggling.
[99:33.39]I mean, yeah.
[99:34.27]Why am I struggling?
[99:36.66]Did you notice that I sniped out the front tire before I got in?
[99:40.42]Why did you do that?
[99:42.45]I just wanted to see if you would notice.
[99:45.05]See if you would notice?
[99:46.61]Yeah.
[99:47.65]You didn't.
[99:48.69]I mean, no, I didn't, because this game is so dirty.
[99:51.16]Are we going to get in the helicopter?
[99:52.46]No, we're going to the plane.
[99:53.74]Where's the plane?
[99:54.50]You don't see the plane on your mini-map right now?
[99:56.04]No, I don't.
[99:56.88]There is a plane right over here.
[100:00.26]Might be why we're just having trouble getting any traction here.
[100:04.84]There's no reason to be, but we can get there faster doing this.
[100:11.23]We gotta be very careful about this because it's being guarded.
[100:14.33]I'm gonna snipe the guy right to the left here.
[100:19.07]Where's my sniper rifle?
[100:26.92]There's a lot of guys here.
[100:28.12]Be smart.
[100:28.68]Don't fuck this up.
[100:34.45]I only see three.
[100:35.03]You missed?
[100:35.29]I missed.
[100:39.61]That supply plane looks fueled up and ready to fly.
[100:41.89]Let's grab it.
[100:42.93]Shit.
[100:43.27]I'm gonna die.
[100:44.95]I'm dead.
[100:47.63]That guy doesn't die.
[100:48.37]Oh, gosh.
[100:50.21]Don't die.
[100:50.83]Come get me.
[100:51.41]Quick.
[100:53.43]Don't die.
[100:54.29]Don't die.
[100:56.67]He's got armor.
[100:57.69]I know he has armor.
[100:58.31]Just revive me.
[100:59.67]I'll be like the bullet sponge while you pick me up.
[101:09.93]Wow, Talix, nice work.
[101:12.87]Thank you, Solid Snake.
[101:14.91]Nice work, Talix.
[101:16.17]That was not easy.
[101:17.62]Alright, right.
[101:18.64]One.
[101:19.58]Two.
[101:20.88]Three.
[101:21.20]Pop your head up.
[101:22.38]Very, very softly.
[101:24.88]Alright.
[101:26.76]I missed the first shot, too.
[101:27.80]Is that guy still alive?
[101:29.08]Oh, no!
[101:29.83]What did you just do?
[101:30.63]What happened?
[101:31.47]I didn't do it.
[101:32.03]What the fuck just happened?
[101:32.91]It just exploded.
[101:33.51]Why did it explode?
[101:34.77]I don't know.
[101:35.45]Why did this just explode?
[101:36.51]I did not shoot it.
[101:37.25]Ubisoft, what happened?
[101:41.25]Why did that just happen?
[101:43.13]Why?
[101:44.99]I... I did not do it.
[101:47.54]What the fuck was that?
[101:50.62]Maybe we accidentally did it?
[101:53.14]No, we didn't do anything.
[101:55.46]Nobody shot it, it just decided to explode.
[101:57.69]Can you revive me?
[101:59.93]Yeah.
[102:01.96]Maybe you can't fly the plane.
[102:04.04]Is this like a... That's so... That side mission failed.
[102:09.66]Maybe we can, like, come back and do it again.
[102:11.86]Side mission failed.
[102:13.99]Ay-yi-yi.
[102:14.57]Well, there's, like, I think there's stuff here to take.
[102:17.93]Yeah, there's random shit over here.
[102:18.93]I think we have enough... Maybe they threw a grenade.
[102:25.21]Yeah, we gotta keep picking up this stuff.
[102:26.79]I don't know.
[102:27.27]You didn't throw a grenade.
[102:28.81]No, maybe they did.
[102:30.57]There's nobody left to throw the grenade.
[102:31.79]They're all dead.
[102:33.61]Maybe they rigged it.
[102:34.49]Booby trap.
[102:37.90]No way.
[102:38.90]Booby booby.
[102:40.34]Alright, let's take a look.
[102:41.28]Can I do a parachute yet?
[102:43.18]No, I can't.
[102:44.66]That takes so much.
[102:50.74]Weapon, stable aim.
[102:52.12]I don't want any of this stuff.
[102:53.16]I really don't.
[102:53.70]Squad resilience.
[102:56.43]Drone, night vision range.
[102:58.45]No, I want...
[103:01.95]I think I can spend those points and not have to worry about it, though.
[103:06.31]Oh, well.
[103:06.91]Let's go to the story mission.
[103:08.27]It's over there.
[103:08.77]I want the plane.
[103:14.26]Mommy.
[103:14.74]All right.
[103:16.08]What's the control to switch from grenade?
[103:18.42]What do you mean?
[103:21.54]Actually, where's key binding?
[103:24.54]Oh, there we go.
[103:26.80]What an awful menu for that.
[103:29.71]It should be in there somewhere.
[103:34.27]You can be in the menu while you're in the car.
[103:37.79]Let me drive you around.
[103:51.72]All right, so... I'm being falsely accused of destroying the plane.
[103:55.43]All right, first thing that comes to you... So far, over the last couple hours, right?
[103:58.95]First thing that comes to your mind... No, do not hold back.
[104:02.69]This is kind of like those things where it's like, vegetable, carrot, you know what I mean?
[104:05.94]All right, you have to say two words, two words.
[104:07.90]How do you feel about the game right now?
[104:08.96]Two words, go.
[104:09.26]Go.
[104:11.38]Pretty weird.
[104:12.44]That's three words.
[104:13.08]Pretty weird.
[104:13.99]Okay, now do me.
[104:15.23]It looks good to explain.
[104:16.83]It looks good, but it feels weird.
[104:18.25]Okay, do me.
[104:21.09]Do me.
[104:21.63]Okay, do me.
[104:24.25]So, German.
[104:25.13]Yeah.
[104:26.22]If we were doing rapid fire words, you had to tell me what you feel.
[104:30.86]What would you say?
[104:31.48]Game sucks.
[104:39.92]We all knew it was coming.
[104:41.14]Oh shit.
[104:45.54]I wanted to fly off that.
[104:49.64]I knew chat would latch onto you saying, do me.
[104:53.01]What is that bug?
[104:53.77]That's a giant bug.
[104:54.69]It's an armadillo.
[104:55.69]No, that's a giant beetle.
[104:57.53]That's an armadillo.
[104:58.47]No, that's a beetle.
[104:59.71]That's a giant stag beetle.
[105:01.71]See, look.
[105:02.05]Whoa, whoa.
[105:03.93]I've never seen a beetle that big.
[105:08.61]He's trying to catch it.
[105:11.45]Alright, that's good.
[105:12.35]The jokes suck.
[105:12.97]Let's go.
[105:14.71]No, I don't want to... I don't want to be in the back.
[105:18.86]No!
[105:23.42]What?
[105:23.66]That's our only... It's okay.
[105:25.16]The car's fine.
[105:27.62]No, it's not.
[105:28.34]Not anymore.
[105:29.20]Why did you do that?
[105:30.86]Oh, it was a joke from... It was an EDM joke.
[105:35.31]An EDM joke.
[105:36.43]EDF joke.
[105:36.95]EDF.
[105:37.61]Oh.
[105:42.15]You ain't gonna like this, but I ain't got time to argue.
[105:44.27]I wish there was a melee in this game.
[105:45.55]I would love it.
[105:46.67]Yeah.
[105:47.03]That's the one thing it's missing, isn't it?
[105:48.94]The melee button.
[105:49.84]Yeah.
[105:52.02]Let me shout out some subs.
[105:53.22]That would turn it around.
[105:56.20]Thank you, Smokewise, for the two months.
[105:58.81]Ert110 for two months.
[106:00.37]RadioVidya for 12 months.
[106:02.84]They say, wow, I can't believe I've been giving $5 a month to this joke streamer.
[106:07.75]Though, if my money goes towards future JWF events, then it's fine.
[106:11.73]Also, I wasn't joking about it.
[106:12.73]Dog's Life is the perfect Jerma game.
[106:16.34]Maybe I'll check it out.
[106:17.02]Thanks for the 12 months, dude.
[106:19.56]Nubicorn, thanks for the sub.
[106:21.60]And MooseyFate100, thanks for the sub.
[106:26.64]Welcome.
[106:28.15]I come back and this is what happens.
[106:29.51]I look over at the monitor and this is where we are.
[106:32.82]Yeah.
[106:33.10]What is this?
[106:33.61]Unit dead?
[106:38.59]We get like stars now?
[106:42.03]Apparently it raises the patrol level.
[106:48.12]Okay.
[106:48.26]All right.
[106:49.12]Well, so what do we need to do here?
[106:50.38]Are those submarines?
[106:52.52]What are those boats?
[106:53.24]What are those?
[106:53.78]Those are boats.
[106:56.34]Why would they be boats in this game?
[107:00.70]Come on.
[107:01.12]This guy's pointing at me.
[107:06.86]That guy was just pointing at me as if he was saying, like, get him.
[107:11.66]Come over here.
[107:12.32]I want to grab this guy.
[107:13.68]Wait, this is important.
[107:14.58]Just give me a second.
[107:15.19]It's not going to take long.
[107:22.55]I have to do this.
[107:23.25]And you guys know I do.
[107:26.14]And we can pretend like this wasn't something I was going to do, but sorry, it's happening.
[107:39.64]Like, I know you guys- ALEX WAIT!
[107:43.76]Fine.
[107:44.02]Did he just vanish?
[107:54.83]Did he just disappear?
[108:04.50]Who is that guy?
[108:06.30]Who is that guy?
[108:08.96]He's a unidad, patrol.
[108:12.67]Alright, get out of the fucking boat.
[108:17.35]Get out of there.
[108:20.05]Get out of there, you rascal.
[108:23.77]Fine, you wanna play boat wars?
[108:26.37]We can play boat wars.
[108:29.10]Boat wars.
[108:30.76]Be careful how far you drive, because we're on the edge of the map here.
[108:33.72]What the fuck is going on?
[108:36.16]Yeah, don't worry, I won't.
[108:37.52]Alright, come this way.
[108:40.04]No, we're so distracted.
[108:41.06]What the hell?
[108:41.64]We shouldn't be doing this.
[108:44.92]Are you just shielding?
[108:48.06]Hold on, let me get this guy.
[108:48.80]Let me kill the guy in the top.
[108:50.35]I'm dead.
[108:52.75]These guys are serious.
[108:54.73]And now I can't move.
[108:55.87]Oh, come on.
[109:01.83]God damn it.
[109:04.75]Hey, thank you, Asian Turtle, for the sub.
[109:07.19]Welcome back.
[109:08.53]You know what I think would make the game more fun?
[109:11.05]If you had four people.
[109:12.25]This is a different game.
[109:14.40]And you were playing on the hardest difficulty.
[109:18.06]Actually, this game is probably pretty fun.
[109:19.54]This game, you know what?
[109:21.02]This game probably is fun.
[109:22.24]I think it just kind of sucks on normal mode, because we can just run in and generally not worry.
[109:28.16]How much time do you have left, by the way?
[109:29.83]Four.
[109:30.23]Oh, shit!
[109:30.79]Three.
[109:31.95]Two.
[109:33.23]One.
[109:38.95]Come on!
[109:40.29]Come on!
[109:41.84]Stay with me!
[109:44.90]Stay with me!
[109:48.38]Grenade.
[109:48.66]He threw a grenade.
[109:49.76]He threw a grenade.
[109:56.89]He threw a grenade.
[109:57.53]Do you know what we're supposed to be doing?
[109:59.27]I have no idea.
[110:00.31]Locate the captain.
[110:01.71]With the drone.
[110:02.25]You gotta use the drone.
[110:03.13]Alright, that's you.
[110:04.61]I can't do that shit.
[110:05.58]That's all you, man.
[110:08.84]There's a guy up on the ledge.
[110:13.94]I did not.
[110:14.46]There's no way I hit that guy.
[110:16.36]That was very strange.
[110:18.80]I'm being shot at.
[110:19.50]I need covering fire.
[110:20.72]I'm trying to find where the guy that is shooting at you, where he is.
[110:22.60]There's a bullet drop.
[110:27.38]There is bullet drop and it's not hit scan, which is kind of cool.
[110:32.03]Where's that guy going?
[110:32.71]There's people behind us too.
[110:34.73]Oh shit.
[110:40.48]They're all coming around.
[110:41.18]Yeah, these guys are no joke.
[110:50.26]You are correct.
[110:52.44]They are like the spec ops.
[110:53.83]I thought I could just get in there and just like... No, that's not the case.
[111:06.34]I was having more fun when we were dicking around.
[111:08.12]Whoa!
[111:11.62]Fafnir, thank you for the 1500 bits.
[111:13.03]And they say... What do they say?
[111:17.47]They say, I love you, PS.
[111:18.77]I'm pretty sure you promised beatboxing.
[111:20.43]I did.
[111:21.41]You'll get it before the stream ends, I promise.
[111:25.55]You can beatbox?
[111:27.79]Yeah.
[111:28.29]Kind of.
[111:28.65]Alright, this is like... This is just getting out of hand here.
[111:35.61]I'm going to just sit right here.
[111:36.61]I'm going to use the drone.
[111:38.52]Maybe we both should do it.
[111:39.68]What's the drone?
[111:40.52]Zee?
[111:41.81]Where the fuck is this guy?
[111:46.59]Captain.
[111:49.39]There's a guy coming up behind us.
[111:51.99]I see him.
[111:52.57]Make sure he doesn't kill us.
[111:53.93]There's a lot of people coming up behind us.
[111:56.27]Tango down.
[111:58.00]Good luck.
[111:58.30]They're all running over here.
[111:59.00]Just cover me while I do this.
[112:00.64]What the fuck is happening?
[112:03.52]What did you do?
[112:05.16]They're all behind us.
[112:17.82]I don't fucking... I don't... You know what I was gonna say.
[112:23.72]I don't.
[112:24.46]Like, I don't... I don't.
[112:27.64]I'm going this way.
[112:28.44]I don't even.
[112:29.80]I don't.
[112:30.36]You know what I mean?
[112:31.42]Yeah.
[112:31.94]I know what you mean.
[112:34.05]I know what you mean.
[112:34.65]None of these people... We can't... We can't joke anymore.
[112:43.59]There's no more joke here.
[112:44.61]Got serious.
[112:45.83]Can I sit through the gate?
[112:48.89]No, I can't.
[112:50.59]Hold on.
[112:52.41]Oh, don't go in that room.
[112:53.63]Do you see how many people are behind us?
[112:54.99]Don't go in that room.
[112:56.39]Wait, don't go in this room, you say, huh?
[112:58.35]That one, yeah.
[112:59.02]Well, eat shit, uni-dads.
[113:01.96]Didn't do anything.
[113:10.14]We're not doing this right, though.
[113:12.50]I don't think we are, no.
[113:13.82]We are definitely not doing this correctly.
[113:20.25]Fall back, it says.
[113:23.19]I've got other plans.
[113:24.23]Bringing the drone out again.
[113:27.60]Where is he?
[113:28.32]Where's the captain?
[113:30.30]Captain?
[113:32.98]I'm dead.
[113:33.82]You're dead?
[113:34.80]I'm dead.
[113:35.36]What the?
[113:35.62]Who are these people?
[113:36.24]Those are the people we're supposed to rescue.
[113:38.16]What?
[113:39.11]Open it.
[113:39.57]They can help us.
[113:41.09]Oh my god, get him some guns!
[113:43.17]Get some guns!
[113:43.65]Get the firefighter a gun!
[113:46.37]Here we go!
[113:47.40]Now we've got a fucking squad.
[113:48.36]They're all just casually running away.
[113:50.74]Guys!
[113:51.50]Guys!
[113:52.24]What are you doing?
[113:53.04]Pick up the guns, please!
[113:59.43]We lose.
[114:01.89]That's what it appears, yeah.
[114:03.05]This looks like probably the hardest area of the map.
[114:06.52]And that's on the normal difficulty mode.
[114:08.62]Why were they all dressed like South Park characters?
[114:13.37]That was like Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.
[114:20.81]They had like snow hats on.
[114:22.07]Alright, this time don't fuck this up.
[114:36.43]I'm taking this out.
[114:37.50]Me?
[114:38.50]No, I'm talking about like in general, both of us.
[114:43.34]No, I'll snipe this guy.
[114:56.31]You just walked right in the way.
[114:58.69]Thank God I got that guy because I couldn't see.
[115:02.75]Sniper right here.
[115:06.12]Went right over his head.
[115:09.40]God damn it.
[115:13.04]Look, look, look.
[115:13.60]He's dead.
[115:13.88]Watch the master.
[115:14.48]Come over here.
[115:14.94]Watch the master, he says.
[115:16.04]Come up here.
[115:16.92]Yeah.
[115:28.21]Watching the master.
[115:31.08]Go prone and you'll have way better sniping stability.
[115:35.16]Let's go get the captain.
[115:37.94]We did what we needed to do.
[115:41.07]There's no more sniping posts.
[115:44.27]Let's find out.
[115:44.87]There's one guy.
[115:47.07]There he is.
[115:47.75]There's the captain.
[115:48.71]We're going to interrogate that guy.
[115:55.33]How do we get the fuck in there without being seen?
[115:58.67]I don't have any idea.
[116:00.59]But he's in that building.
[116:12.44]Do you see an entrance anywhere?
[116:13.98]I'm about to drone for you.
[116:16.04]Well, I know where he is, but we have to interrogate him.
[116:17.74]That means we have to get in there.
[116:19.52]Yeah, but in there, there's a lot more people.
[116:21.52]Can I climb like the barbed wire?
[116:28.17]I mean, there's a lot of people.
[116:29.05]We can just... Can't we just sneak in there?
[116:32.81]Yeah, okay.
[116:33.27]I found a little sneak spot.
[116:37.99]Hang on.
[116:38.23]Hang on.
[116:38.49]Hang on.
[116:38.76]Hang on.
[116:39.10]Hang on.
[116:39.96]I'm just... I'm just sneaking in.
[116:41.40]Don't worry about me.
[116:43.36]Does it have a suppressor on it?
[116:44.22]It does.
[116:44.88]Does it?
[116:45.40]Yeah.
[116:46.96]Oh, God.
[116:49.14]That's a kill.
[116:51.96]Might have alerted them to our presence, but... Well, they don't know I'm here.
[116:54.90]They don't know I'm here.
[116:58.22]I'll tag those later.
[117:07.75]I don't want to worry about that right now.
[117:13.64]Where are you going?
[117:17.05]I just see purple cars following you.
[117:19.89]You're like a little buggy.
[117:22.13]I am currently sneaking into the base right now.
[117:24.13]Please do not bring them all in here.
[117:26.62]I'm doing a pretty great job of sneaking around.
[117:30.84]Actually, you know what?
[117:31.88]Be a distraction, dude.
[117:32.90]That's, like, gonna work.
[117:34.48]No, they're all over here now.
[117:37.64]You've alerted them.
[117:41.00]They're all, like, having lunch over here.
[117:42.19]Yeah, look at this.
[117:42.71]And they all, like, have guns drawn and shit.
[117:44.98]Where are you?
[117:45.40]Are you inside the walls?
[117:46.34]I am inside the walls.
[117:47.50]I'm about to go to the building.
[117:48.68]I'm coming to get you.
[117:51.84]Where?
[117:52.98]Oh, that was a sniper.
[117:53.76]What the fuck was that?
[117:57.92]Are you seriously doing this right now?
[118:04.20]You can't be really doing this right now.
[118:06.62]What have you done?
[118:07.96]Get into my warthog.
[118:08.90]No, be the distraction.
[118:10.42]There's a big minigun on the back.
[118:12.63]We need to get in the building.
[118:15.15]Yeah, we're gonna kill the guys first.
[118:16.55]Well, we don't want to put us both in the same spot.
[118:18.01]What if we both get shot?
[118:18.73]Alright, I'm making a run forward to... There!
[118:25.51]Okay, I'm getting in.
[118:28.37]Keep them distracted.
[118:29.11]I'm in the building.
[118:31.29]I'm currently inside the building.
[118:33.23]Going up the stairs.
[118:34.60]Wrapping around.
[118:35.08]There's a fucking Coca-Cola machine in here.
[118:40.06]Pack it.
[118:41.30]Look at...
[118:44.13]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[118:46.77]I just, like, stole money or something.
[118:47.83]Who knows?
[118:49.97]You being real tactical right now?
[118:51.45]Mm-hmm.
[118:53.13]Almost there.
[118:56.86]You're doing a great job, whatever you're doing.
[118:58.58]You're keeping them away from me.
[118:59.42]Yeah, you know, I feel like I'm doing a great job.
[119:01.50]And... No!
[119:04.30]Um...
[119:10.48]Did you assassinate the target?
[119:13.26]I pressed the fucking left mouse button.
[119:17.70]I can't.
[119:18.72]I can't.
[119:20.36]I can't.
[119:21.62]And it hit him right in the fucking head.
[119:23.60]I was trying.
[119:33.01]Oh, no.
[119:34.49]My turn.
[119:35.03]Then the delay, like, okay, ready?
[119:38.21]Listen to this, guys.
[119:39.15]Listen, when I click...
[119:41.00]Look at the delay too.
[119:43.42]I fucking tried to grab him and I just fat fingered my fucking mouse.
[119:48.80]Give me a fucking break.
[119:50.30]What the fuck?
[119:51.88]I am actually upset.
[119:53.36]We're going to be great at this mission.
[119:56.18]I hit him right in the head.
[119:57.44]Like right in the fucking head.
[119:59.48]It couldn't have missed him.
[120:00.28]It couldn't have gone to the right.
[120:01.16]Couldn't have hit him once.
[120:02.52]No.
[120:03.07]Directly into his fucking forehead.
[120:10.12]That's just so... I crouched down like this and I got close enough and it was just going... Okay.
[120:14.76]That's... Give me a break.
[120:17.90]If anybody thinks that that was on purpose, I fucking promise you that I did not do that on purpose.
[120:23.65]I literally did not.
[120:24.71]I just... Oh my god.
[120:26.63]I'm so fucking on tilt right now.
[120:28.45]I just got spotted and I'm going to die.
[120:33.39]I'm dead.
[120:34.13]I'm just in a fucking total fit right now.
[120:42.70]The way he, like, crouched down perfectly and got right in the way, right in the head.
[120:56.01]I wanna see this shit.
[120:57.17]I'm watching this.
[120:58.61]I wanna see what the fuck happened there.
[121:02.97]I'm watching this clip right now.
[121:05.69]I'm dead on the ground.
[121:06.56]I need to see what I did.
[121:08.54]No!
[121:09.52]Yeah, like, I couldn't even have done that if I tried.
[121:14.91]I wouldn't have been able to do that shit even if I wanted to.
[121:19.59]Are you still alive?
[121:20.93]Not anymore.
[121:41.25]Oh, I can't.
[121:43.15]I can't.
[121:44.31]So, I got detected, as you may have seen.
[121:49.19]They found me.
[121:49.86]Fuck.
[122:04.47]All right.
[122:05.57]It's Alex.
[122:07.44]Uh-huh.
[122:07.98]Let's go over roles here, okay?
[122:10.28]Okay.
[122:10.54]We've determined over the course of the last couple of hours.
[122:14.38]You and I have both different ways that we play these games, okay?
[122:17.94]So let me be the obnoxious distraction.
[122:21.50]Let me drive the car into the fucking compound while you do the finesse work.
[122:25.84]Let me be the wild card.
[122:27.66]You be the 80s rock star that you just turned into.
[122:33.14]Alright, does that sound like a plan?
[122:35.38]Why are we separating our different styles?
[122:37.36]Why would we do something like that?
[122:38.80]You're the brains, I'm the brawn.
[122:40.84]Okay, so what are you saying?
[122:43.31]I'm getting a fucking dune buggy, whatever the hell.
[122:45.13]I'm getting one of those little... That's what I tried to do the first time.
[122:47.71]Yeah, but it worked, and then I shot the guy in the head accidentally.
[122:50.05]So you're... Wait, hold on.
[122:51.85]Wait, wait, don't get shot.
[122:53.57]Got him.
[122:54.85]Hold on, we're playing it smart.
[123:00.24]I didn't hit him in the head.
[123:04.46]I need somebody to tell me how fucking bad I am at this game.
[123:12.07]I just try to rush too fast.
[123:14.15]I'm trying to go too fast.
[123:15.27]Did you kill that sniper yet?
[123:16.51]I did.
[123:17.03]He's dead.
[123:17.65]He's dead.
[123:18.11]Alright.
[123:25.33]You ready?
[123:25.73]You ready for the distraction?
[123:29.97]I want to be in the distraction too.
[123:31.95]No, no.
[123:32.47]You have to be the one that sneaks in.
[123:33.73]You can't... No.
[123:35.07]No, we both go.
[123:37.39]You know what?
[123:38.37]Live together or die alone, you know?
[123:41.33]All right.
[123:42.15]I was supposed to be the wild card here.
[123:43.43]I'll drive.
[123:44.07]We're both... I'm the wild card, too.
[123:46.12]Okay.
[123:51.20]That's... You know what?
[123:52.16]Good thinking.
[123:52.96]That's why you're the brains.
[123:55.02]So how did you get in?
[123:56.90]How did I... LD?
[124:01.31]Oh, you mean like this?
[124:02.21]Oh, I thought you meant getting into the car.
[124:07.15]Alright, we didn't even spot where he was.
[124:09.38]We have no idea where he is.
[124:14.64]What building was he in?
[124:16.80]Whoa!
[124:19.38]Okay, this is actually a pretty good spot.
[124:22.45]I just gotta drive straight through this.
[124:25.47]Come on.
[124:25.99]I know I can do it.
[124:26.63]I did it.
[124:27.25]Alright, he's in this building.
[124:30.95]To the right, to the right.
[124:31.59]All right, get out.
[124:35.73]I can't see a thing.
[124:36.67]Get out, get out, get out.
[124:37.15]Be right here.
[124:42.02]Interrogate.
[124:48.90]All right, you interrogate them.
[124:49.84]I'll snipe people from the roof.
[124:51.28]You got it.
[124:56.67]Wait, what?
[124:58.43]You may as well kill me now.
[124:59.43]I'm not talking, carajo.
[125:01.03]Well, that's your choice.
[125:02.29]But with a pair of sick fucks like Yuri and Polito, one day that might be you hanging from their ceiling.
[125:07.25]You can't trust them.
[125:08.73]It would be a relief if I took them out of your life.
[125:11.66]Oh, I'm down.
[125:12.22]There's a guy underneath you.
[125:13.26]Guy underneath you.
[125:16.12]I'm not done interrogating.
[125:16.98]They've made it to the roof.
[125:18.90]I'm not done interrogating this guy.
[125:20.36]Package ready.
[125:23.12]um um um they're coming he's just on the cell phone while I'm being shot are they in this room they are pretty much in the room I don't get this we completed the mission we're okay yeah so somehow we did it I don't I don't know how I was see I was getting shot I got skill point for being dead
[125:57.77]Alright, I'm coming to get you.
[125:59.64]There's two guys on my body.
[126:01.72]Three.
[126:02.94]Okay, seriously, what the fuck was that shit?
[126:04.68]What the fuck was that?
[126:06.80]What the fuck was that?
[126:07.72]Three guys.
[126:10.79]Ubisoft.
[126:11.53]Where the fuck is the realism?
[126:14.63]Did we lose that mission?
[126:15.31]They were wearing super body armor.
[126:16.33]Don't tell me they were in that.
[126:17.53]No, that was mission complete.
[126:18.65]Thank fucking God.
[126:21.31]Those guys were just sitting there, like, clipping around, and then all of a sudden I died.
[126:29.37]Fall back.
[126:30.51]Fall back.
[126:30.97]Are we done there?
[126:31.61]We're done there, right?
[126:32.29]Okay.
[126:32.57]Thank Jesus.
[126:35.75]What else is there?
[126:36.33]This?
[126:38.25]Stop and tag the convoy.
[126:41.53]You got it.
[126:42.53]Let's do it.
[126:46.75]What wasn't real about that?
[126:50.78]Hold on.
[126:51.86]I may have just discovered something very vital.
[126:53.90]Discovered something?
[126:54.62]Really?
[126:55.90]Really.
[126:57.88]We can't just be out here in the middle of nowhere, though.
[127:00.33]We have to, uh... Gotta find some people.
[127:04.73]Dude, it's gonna take so long to get a parachute.
[127:06.19]I'm just, like, gonna... Mine.
[127:10.77]Yep.
[127:12.27]I can't figure out how to equip that.
[127:14.83]Mine's a ground place explosive charges.
[127:17.91]Equip them in loadout.
[127:20.19]You gotta go to your loadout, hit I. Yeah.
[127:23.19]And then...
[127:25.41]I've already done that.
[127:27.48]It replaces... We should just have it, I guess.
[127:33.70]It's just in there.
[127:34.86]I know.
[127:35.24]I can't figure out how to use it.
[127:36.72]The brightness is so bright right now.
[127:50.28]Wait.
[127:50.50]Are you looking in the menu?
[127:52.02]What is it like?
[127:54.90]Let's see.
[127:56.74]Options, keyboard and mouse.
[128:01.22]Oh, figured out.
[128:04.61]How do you do it?
[128:06.51]Four.
[128:07.35]Four.
[128:08.57]All right, cool.
[128:10.09]Good to know.
[128:12.77]Let's go do this.
[128:18.17]Alright, but there's something else I have to figure out.
[128:20.33]Yeah.
[128:20.75]But I need to find civilization first.
[128:22.75]We need to find people, a car, something.
[128:27.25]Or a military chopper.
[128:29.69]Hey, doctor.
[128:30.39]Thanks for the sub.
[128:31.17]And Dutch crafter for two months.
[128:32.39]Welcome back, guys.
[128:33.15]What are you trying to figure out?
[128:46.14]Apparently I'm being seen by somebody.
[128:47.54]Don't ask me how.
[128:53.52]Wild lands.
[128:59.10]Okay.
[129:00.38]Well, this will save us a little bit of time.
[129:01.70]How do you use the mine?
[129:04.70]I can't, like, use the mine.
[129:08.74]Do you know how to use the mine?
[129:10.78]No, not yet.
[129:13.31]This is like... This is like an area for me to do it.
[129:15.53]Do I have to be crouched?
[129:17.15]Like, you know... You know... You know... You don't have to do that, you know.
[129:25.16]Alright, I think I know how to do it.
[129:35.98]Watch out, watch out.
[129:39.26]I love how it says fall back.
[129:44.51]Fall back.
[129:46.01]Yeah, okay, fall back.
[129:48.09]The guys that just drove straight into me and started shooting me, fall back.
[129:54.87]Sorry, can we get the fuck out of here?
[129:58.92]Can we get the fuck out of here?
[130:02.50]How do you put the stupid mine down?
[130:04.36]I don't know.
[130:08.40]Oh, fall back.
[130:10.40]Yeah, that's the meme now.
[130:13.43]Watch out.
[130:25.16]Alright, I want to test this.
[130:32.63]Put it down.
[130:38.13]Why can't I just, like, throw this mine?
[130:39.27]There doesn't seem to be any button to put it down.
[130:41.15]I did it.
[130:41.47]I don't know how I did it.
[130:42.15]You don't know how you did it?
[130:43.03]What did you press?
[130:43.71]Everything?
[130:45.39]I just kept tapping G. Okay, I just did the same thing.
[130:47.87]Oh, God.
[130:50.99]Okay, now we wait.
[130:55.25]We're taking the car.
[130:56.15]Matter of national security.
[130:57.53]Out.
[130:58.65]Hope this thing's got plenty of gas.
[131:01.51]Now we just gotta wait for a minute.
[131:02.91]No, watch out, italics.
[131:04.05]Don't go over the mine.
[131:06.17]Clearing the road.
[131:06.93]Oh, good.
[131:10.73]Oh, there's one idiot that wants to drive by.
[131:12.23]That's actually... That's like a Scooby-Doo car.
[131:18.12]I kinda want it.
[131:20.32]Alright, yeah.
[131:21.14]I want someone to come on this side of the road.
[131:25.65]maybe it only hits enemies can you like make that guy walk over here what was that rip you dead does it confirmed does not only hit enemies oh boy here we go oh no this person is just like oh we're gonna take a Sunday Drive
[132:00.77]Holy shit.
[132:03.27]You okay?
[132:08.30]I think they're gonna be alright.
[132:15.98]I was already grenading it before you ran up.
[132:18.52]He got out of the car and then he like dove into the ground.
[132:22.25]He just cowered, man.
[132:23.43]He panicked.
[132:24.13]He didn't know what to do.
[132:24.89]Can we please go?
[132:26.57]What keeps making that sound?
[132:27.93]Let's get in this car.
[132:29.23]Let's just do this mission.
[132:30.33]Let's get the fuck out of this.
[132:31.85]Please.
[132:32.29]Hold on.
[132:32.69]I gotta try one more thing.
[132:33.97]No, no.
[132:34.35]Don't put mines on.
[132:34.99]You're gonna put mines on the car, aren't you?
[132:35.93]No, it's not mine.
[132:37.01]Hang on.
[132:37.25]You're gonna put a mine on the car, aren't you?
[132:38.79]No.
[132:39.25]Just wait for this other car to get here.
[132:40.79]It's important.
[132:43.05]Okay.
[132:44.77]What other car?
[132:46.31]This one.
[132:46.72]Oh, this guy.
[132:47.20]This one right here.
[132:48.04]Okay.
[132:54.18]Yeah.
[132:55.30]Wait.
[132:55.94]Get out.
[132:57.36]No, come back.
[133:00.47]What are you doing?
[133:02.09]Come over here.
[133:03.93]What are you doing?
[133:04.69]This might not even be funny, but you were asking about it earlier.
[133:07.75]All right.
[133:08.97]Oh, there's a melee.
[133:09.53]How do you do the melee?
[133:10.93]F. F.
[133:15.52]But you can't hit civilians with it!
[133:17.26]Alright, let's get in.
[133:20.00]Don't worry about it.
[133:23.82]We got a mission to do.
[133:24.50]The fact that you can't hit civilians... Also, my audio's messed up again.
[133:33.38]Did it mess up again?
[133:34.47]Well, once we get over here, we'll throw a grenade at you.
[133:48.40]You know, we have to do it.
[133:50.11]Come on!
[133:50.95]Come on!
[133:53.03]Come on, this stupid fucking sign.
[133:55.77]Get back in.
[133:56.39]We're fine.
[133:56.85]The car is completely fine.
[133:58.41]Nothing is wrong with the car.
[133:59.31]Get in.
[134:02.43]Worth it.
[134:03.53]Stopped by a sign.
[134:07.07]A shitty, like, plastic sign.
[134:08.79]Let's just get back on the road.
[134:13.93]Oh, hold on.
[134:15.91]What is this?
[134:26.26]Oh, that is... Yeah.
[134:32.71]Don't let them destroy this.
[134:36.15]Who's left?
[134:43.51]No, no, don't.
[134:44.26]Just get to the line of sight from the helicopter.
[134:46.18]Alright, I think we're good to get in.
[134:54.16]There's one more.
[134:54.92]Two more.
[134:55.38]It's okay.
[134:55.72]I think we can take off without getting in trouble.
[134:57.42]Yep.
[134:57.62]Let's go.
[134:59.92]Oh, boy.
[135:01.06]Ah.
[135:02.24]Get in.
[135:02.64]Get in.
[135:03.70]Get in.
[135:06.44]Get in.
[135:07.74]Oh.
[135:09.08]Is there a gunner seat on this?
[135:11.14]No.
[135:11.32]I don't know.
[135:11.68]I can shoot from it.
[135:13.60]All right.
[135:13.80]Where are we going?
[135:18.26]Uh.
[135:18.39]I don't know.
[135:18.73]I physically can't see anything.
[135:23.88]Alright, take the helicopter to the Rebel RV.
[135:25.70]We have to go this way.
[135:31.15]I don't think I can shoot or anything.
[135:32.13]This helicopter kind of sucks.
[135:34.27]This is like the Grand Theft Auto helicopter.
[135:39.51]I can't go up!
[135:40.91]I can't go up!
[135:42.36]I'm holding... I know.
[135:44.84]I know.
[135:49.61]I want to believe you tried your hardest.
[135:51.69]Dude, why?
[135:54.08]These controls.
[135:55.48]I couldn't go up.
[135:57.92]I know.
[135:58.74]Please, Alex, tell them.
[136:00.44]He's right.
[136:01.22]You can't go up.
[136:02.40]Tell them.
[136:04.62]Tell them.
[136:05.50]You just can't go up.
[136:09.54]I'm trying to, like, I'm holding shift and it just stays straight.
[136:12.38]I feel like here's the thing they didn't consider.
[136:15.76]It feels like you can't hold forward and go up at the same time.
[136:19.21]I let go of W. I was just holding shift.
[136:22.17]I have no idea.
[136:26.31]Alright, let's do one more mission.
[136:27.77]I think I'm gonna, like, fucking go.
[136:31.69]Yeah.
[136:33.95]Yeah, we've seen about as much as there is to see.
[136:36.27]We've seen enough of the beta, I think.
[136:41.23]Very pretty, though.
[136:42.49]Alright, let's do this.
[136:42.97]Let's get this last mission done.
[136:43.69]That's what I was saying.
[136:44.33]Like, it looks nice.
[136:46.47]It's just really, I guess the word is wonky.
[136:51.36]Yeah.
[136:51.80]Alright.
[136:52.30]I'm going to grab a car.
[136:57.74]And we'll go to this area and see what it is.
[137:00.70]And then I think we can call it there.
[137:05.95]I mean, I can't say it hasn't been, like, fun, though.
[137:08.78]I've been having, like, fun just playing with you, just messing around.
[137:12.97]yeah that's kind of I feel like the game is meant to be played on like harder difficulty levels and take it very seriously like all right I'm gonna be the guy that gets all the people sighted in you'll be the sniper you'll be a distraction we'll go in you have to take it like serious it's not like it doesn't seem like it does even though it kind of feels like far cry it feels like just like this is just far crying it kind of does feel like far cry it's just like we played far cry it's just another version of far cry
[137:44.42]Yeah.
[137:45.88]I can see that.
[137:46.44]There's a guy to interrogate over there.
[137:55.28]Bang a left.
[137:57.78]We're gonna obey the rules of the road this time.
[137:59.59]Not gonna do anything stupid.
[138:01.43]Just follow the road.
[138:04.33]It kind of reminds me of the problem that open world games tend to have, which is you can do whatever you want.
[138:14.27]It just so happens that whatever you want is going to be kind of the same no matter where you go.
[138:22.08]Yeah.
[138:22.66]I think it's the area, too.
[138:24.56]Because games like Grand Theft Auto, they have that same mentality.
[138:28.90]Like, you can go wherever you want.
[138:30.85]But there's like a lot of interesting shit to do in GTA, whereas in games like this, it's like... Go to that base and get the guy!
[138:38.49]Drive the car on the dirt road!
[138:39.91]What are we doing?
[138:42.13]Hang on, hang on.
[138:42.57]That guy is a bad guy.
[138:43.95]He doesn't even see us.
[138:44.59]Which guy's a bad guy?
[138:45.69]Behind you to the left.
[138:48.22]Oh, what a terrible lookout.
[138:49.98]He's got binoculars.
[138:51.76]Oh shit!
[138:52.80]Somebody just got in here!
[138:54.06]Target is down.
[138:55.93]He was holding binoculars.
[138:56.97]He was such tunnel vision.
[138:58.43]All right, what are we supposed to be doing here?
[139:01.03]Are we going to get in the guy's sports car?
[139:03.91]Uh, yeah.
[139:08.29]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[139:11.59]Don't blow the car up.
[139:13.77]I'm down.
[139:14.63]Are you?
[139:17.21]Pretty close to you.
[139:17.91]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[139:22.11]Where'd he go?
[139:22.71]Where'd that guy- that guy disappeared.
[139:24.89]That guy disappeared into the fucking mist.
[139:26.30]There he is.
[139:28.48]That's a fucking civilian.
[139:29.46]I was wondering why he was running.
[139:33.26]Oh no.
[139:37.03]Did you get the car in there?
[139:39.67]I'll come- Talix, I'll come back for you.
[139:52.15]This thing is fucking toast.
[139:58.29]Oh god.
[139:59.45]Oh, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[140:02.94]What do we have to do?
[140:03.86]What?
[140:08.06]That is the question of the hour.
[140:10.68]What do we have to do?
[140:12.32]Dude, this car is swanky.
[140:17.52]I don't know what to do next.
[140:23.13]Wait, that was the whole mission?
[140:24.25]I don't know.
[140:24.77]I'm kind of afraid.
[140:32.19]There's two bloody condoms in the car?
[140:34.74]Yeah, that's kind of gross.
[140:36.86]What?
[140:37.50]Alright, let's turn this way.
[140:38.74]This is our last ride at Alex, okay?
[140:40.06]Last ride in the already about to be destroyed.
[140:43.92]Is there like a way to stash these or something?
[140:47.14]I don't know, but this thing is such a bag of shit at the moment.
[140:53.10]This is our last ride.
[141:01.56]So far, I am unimpressed.
[141:03.20]Let's go get the convoy.
[141:05.01]Yeah, that's where we're going right now.
[141:06.99]Hold on.
[141:07.35]No, no.
[141:07.67]The side mission with the plane.
[141:09.61]What?
[141:10.39]The side mission with the plane is back.
[141:11.81]Okay, yeah.
[141:12.19]Let's do that.
[141:12.59]This is our last ride.
[141:20.46]Go steal the plane.
[141:21.32]We can fly the plane.
[141:22.08]That'll be the last thing we do.
[141:22.94]Why does it want me to go that way?
[141:27.14]That's faster?
[141:29.06]This is awful.
[141:39.13]It sounds like a little RC car.
[141:43.01]Here's the convoy.
[141:44.37]This is what we had to do.
[141:45.97]We had to do this.
[141:49.98]Are we fast and furious now, boys?
[141:51.82]Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him.
[141:52.83]We have to, like, we have to kill this thing.
[141:57.41]Driver's dead.
[141:59.85]I'm being distracted.
[142:01.67]Distraction.
[142:03.61]Got the car.
[142:04.31]Distracted.
[142:05.53]Mission failed.

[142:10.80]What?
[142:11.16]Alright, that's a... We're done.
[142:15.48]We're fucking out of here.
[142:18.27]Was it a different car?
[142:19.17]It was a big one, right?
[142:20.31]You were inside of it.
[142:21.21]It was fine.
[142:26.60]You were in the car.
[142:27.54]Yeah, it was... Maybe they hit the satellite on top of it or something?
[142:31.62]I don't know.
[142:32.78]It bothers me.
[142:34.74]It bothers me.
[142:40.47]Okay, um...
[142:46.83]Oh, what time is it?
[142:48.87]7.30.
[142:48.97]I actually probably should get going.
[142:51.93]It is almost like 8 o'clock and I need to make a few phone calls.
[142:57.03]But, before I do that, I'm going to hang out for a second.
[142:59.99]I'm going to do something I promised I would do.
[143:02.96]Oh, you're going to tell your entertainer?
[143:07.02]Yeah.

[143:53.60]Yeah, it has.
[143:54.66]I'm glad we got something to play.
[144:00.75]But I will talk to you.
[144:01.63]Well, watch the stream if you want to hear it.
[144:03.35]I'll get performance anxiety in front of you.
[144:06.58]He can do it in front of 2,000 people.
[144:08.62]He can't do it in front of me.
[144:10.26]I'm gonna get, like, performance anxiety.
[144:12.84]I'm the viewer that can talk back.
[144:15.34]Yeah, you can, like, you can give me direct feedback.
[144:17.74]Yeah.
[144:18.60]Immediate vocal feedback.
[144:20.62]Either way, thanks, everybody.
[144:21.99]What am I even gonna do?
[144:22.53]I'm just gonna have to, like, make something fucking up at the fly.
[144:24.53]While he figures that out, thanks for having me, and catch you all guys later.
[144:29.87]Bye-bye.
[144:30.35]Take it easy, Talix.
[144:34.75]Alright.
[144:35.75]Let's go to like switch to like get some tea or something.
[144:40.03]Alright.
[144:40.77]Here we go.
[144:41.82]Look, before I do this, I just want to say I'm not good at this shit.
[144:46.52]I just do it sometimes.
[144:49.12]If it sucks, it sucks.
[144:50.12]I'm sorry.
[144:50.62]I don't even know what I'm going to do for a song.
[144:54.70]Jingle bells?
[144:55.16]You want me to do jingle bells?
[144:55.96]I can do jingle bells.
[144:56.82]For sure.
[145:01.80]Blank screen?
[145:02.30]Yeah, it's going to be a blank screen.
[145:03.34]And then I'm going to end the stream.
[145:07.27]Jingle bells is going to be... Let's go for it.
[145:16.17]I'm not used to doing this in front of this many people.
[145:19.84]Here we go.
[145:21.16]Humble brag?
[145:21.70]No, no, no.
[145:22.20]I swear to God.
[145:23.60]I don't have the advanced techniques.
[145:26.50]I just kind of do it for fun.
[145:28.72]Make fun of me if you want.
[145:29.74]But here we go.
[145:42.54]Oh, it's terrible.
[145:43.84]It's terrible.
[145:44.20]Let me start over.
[146:11.62]I'm like running out of breath
[146:42.52]There you go.
[146:49.48]It wasn't that great.
[146:50.44]It was okay.
[146:51.88]Performance anxiety.
[146:52.95]There you go.
[147:02.65]Look at that fucking failfish.
[147:09.10]Yeah, I didn't even... I didn't have any practice.
[147:10.74]I could probably practice and do it a little bit better and have a little bit more... A little bit more base.
[147:18.59]There was a couple of times I was fucked up in the middle there, but I just do it for fun.
[147:21.47]I don't... I don't want to have you guys think I'm, like, the greatest.
[147:27.59]Hey, Merry Christmas, guys.
[147:30.66]Encore?
[147:31.40]Uh, how about, um... I could always do... I always... The Final Fantasy theme song is fun to do.
[147:41.34]While this plays out.
[147:42.92]We'll do Final Fantasy.
[147:45.51]You're so anxious.
[147:46.35]It's adorable.
[147:47.49]It's hard to do shit like this when you're on the spot.
[147:51.31]I usually will just sit here with the microphone off and do stuff like that.
[148:00.62]Have a good night, guys.
[148:03.22]Acid bass.
[148:05.41]there you go the rats theme song um
[148:41.17]He was prepared for acid bass?
[148:42.29]I was not!
[148:48.49]It's hard, it's like, I gotta get the flip there.
[148:55.78]It's hard to do like the... When your mouth is dry.
[149:04.57]Better than the comb stream.
[149:07.83]I promised I would do that for a long time.
[149:09.72]There are certain people that wanted me to do it.
[149:11.64]But... I could use a little practice.
[149:20.12]But thanks a lot for watching, guys.
[149:21.24]Take care.
[149:22.34]I will see you guys...
[149:25.62]Next time.
