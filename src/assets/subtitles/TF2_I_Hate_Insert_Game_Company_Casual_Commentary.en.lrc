[00:08.72]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.32]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.01]And tonight, not exactly sure what I'm going to be playing as.
[00:18.41]I'm going to be playing as one of the nine classes, I assume.
[00:21.45]Maybe even the tenth class, the Indian Chief Master.
[00:25.17]No, I have no idea.
[00:26.15]So this video is not going to talk about Team Fortress 2.
[00:29.01]It's going to be a discussion video.
[00:30.59]It's going to be something that was brought up last night when I was hanging out in Starz stream.
[00:36.58]If you were there, then you probably know what this commentary is going to be about.
[00:40.58]But if you weren't there, let me briefly bring this up.
[00:44.21]We were playing a game in Alpha, and it's called Cannon Brawl.
[00:47.71]It's pretty fun.
[00:48.78]It's a 1v1 type of Worms RTS hybrid base building tower shooting game, and it's great.
[00:54.76]I suggest you pick it up.
[00:55.58]It's like less than 10 bucks.
[00:57.20]If you got the money, you and your friend can have at least a few hours of fun, regardless of any of that.
[01:03.30]a couple of developers were actually in the stream chat.
[01:06.48]The guys that made the game were hanging out in Star's stream.
[01:09.83]We got to talking with them.
[01:10.79]They were legitimate.
[01:11.51]They weren't like making it up.
[01:12.53]It wasn't like, oh yeah, I'm the developer.
[01:14.53]And it just wasn't them.
[01:15.75]It was actually them, which was cool in itself.
[01:18.21]I love talking to developers.
[01:20.11]I love seeing where they're coming from, seeing their angles, finding out stuff about them, the backstory, etc.
[01:25.97]And that kind of conversation got into people talking about in the comments section.
[01:30.17]how much they hate certain developers because they don't do certain things, they have bad customer support, and screw them, like, like, fuck EA.
[01:39.16]And that's the topic of this discussion, that's the topic of this video, that's where I want to go with this.
[01:44.94]Because when you say something like, in quotes, fuck EA, end quotes, what you're effectively saying is this.
[01:54.46]At least for the most part, this is what people mean when they utter this phrase.
[01:58.54]What they're really talking about is the consumer-company relationship.
[02:03.39]And the consumer-company relationship can mean a million different things.
[02:06.03]It can mean the amount of money you have to spend on something.
[02:09.31]It can mean who's in charge that's making broad-spectrum company decisions.
[02:14.92]It could mean...
[02:16.56]how the company reacts to negative criticism or positive criticism.
[02:21.18]It can mean a bunch of different things.
[02:23.57]But a lot of people really, really get upset with, and I'm in this category myself.
[02:27.87]I'm included in this.
[02:29.67]I get really mad at a company when they blatantly just mishandle the stuff I just said.
[02:35.18]For instance...
[02:36.44]When a company charges way too much money for something, it annoys me.
[02:40.02]When a company doesn't follow through on promises it makes, it annoys me.
[02:43.99]When a company has a CEO that's like a complete dickwad, that annoys me.
[02:49.15]But something that we all have to keep in mind is it's not just one guy that makes a video game.
[02:56.19]It's not just one dude that is making all these decisions for this company.
[03:01.10]There are thousands and thousands of people that are working for EA.
[03:06.48]There are artists, there are programmers, there are coders, there are marketing people, there are advertising people, there are people on the board.
[03:14.32]If it's just one person you don't like, then do you really hate the company?
[03:18.78]Or do you hate the person that's in charge?
[03:21.78]Or do you hate this one particular person on the development team?
[03:25.59]I'm going to give you a real situation of this.
[03:28.85]For instance, Diablo 3.
[03:31.33]Diablo 3 was one of my most anticipated games ever.
[03:35.31]Like, I was waiting so much for that game.
[03:37.71]I couldn't wait for it to come out.
[03:38.81]The second it came out, I bought it like, midnight release, let's go, I'm gonna spend like 30 hours playing this game straight.
[03:45.00]And I had a little bit of fun in D3.
[03:48.00]I enjoyed myself.
[03:49.56]But after a while, it started to really annoy me that the developers...
[03:54.42]took this game such in a far direction away from one of my favorite games of all time, which is Diablo 2.
[04:00.29]I made a review of Diablo 3, and I even said, if you're a die-hard Diablo 2 fan, this game's gonna let you down in a lot of places.
[04:08.24]And it really got me thinking,
[04:10.70]Do I hate Blizzard for making Diablo 3 the way they did?
[04:14.76]I guess maybe there'd be a couple of rage moments when I was sitting in a game going, man, like, I hate Blizzard.
[04:20.43]What the hell, man?
[04:21.31]Like, what did you do to this game?
[04:22.47]Like, how could you, Blizzard?
[04:23.75]In quotes, just like the same EA, how could you?
[04:27.32]Fuck you, EA.
[04:28.68]But then you break it down even more, and it's like, but who...
[04:31.48]who was even really responsible for this.
[04:33.46]It was not Blizzard as a whole, it was only like a few guys in Blizzard that probably made these decisions.
[04:41.01]The Starcraft guys didn't do it, the friggin' Warcraft team had nothing to do with it, so why would I hate Blizzard as a company when it only was a couple of people that really had the say?
[04:52.42]And something else to keep in mind is most of the people that work for these companies, guys, are just going to work.
[04:58.50]They're just going to work, and they're doing their thing, and they're going home, and they're going home to their family.
[05:02.46]They're working their ass off as a programmer, or an artist, or a coder, or a concept designer.
[05:07.77]And then they leave, and they go home to their families.
[05:10.69]And they don't read forum posts about how much people hate the company that they work for.
[05:15.63]Hell, they might not even like the company they work for, but they're doing it anyways.
[05:18.98]And my whole point here is...
[05:21.48]When you make a generalization about really anything, you include all the people that you really didn't mean to include when you made the generalization.
[05:32.51]So, just keep that in mind.
[05:34.17]It's something that we were talking about in the stream, and I was like, you know what?
[05:36.91]I want to make a commentary about this.
[05:38.57]I want to see what everybody has to say, so please, in the comment section below,
[05:43.39]leave what you think about this leave your opinions on this and maybe some generalizations that you've made over the last couple of years because I know I've done plenty of them when it comes to game companies for sure but yeah that's gonna wrap it up here guys thank you all so much for watching I really do appreciate it and I'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody
