[00:08.51]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10.67]It's Grandpa here, and welcome to Black Ops 2!
[00:15.05]We've been waiting for this game for so long, and it's finally here.
[00:18.89]I can't wait to talk about it.
[00:20.59]I could even sing a song about this game, but I'm not going to.
[00:25.02]We're going to talk about tips and tricks, and what I've found in the game so far to be cool, and that sort of shit.
[00:30.74]So sit back and relax, and let's do it!
[00:34.08]So the first tip I can give you is to go right to your menu the second you load the game up.
[00:39.38]And get yourself pumped up for Black Ops 2.
[00:41.80]You want to crank the music as loud as it can possibly go.
[00:45.75]And here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47.09]Black Ops 2 is in the house.
[00:48.59]Crank that volume.
[00:49.47]Let's go, baby.
[00:51.95]Do-do-do-do-do.
[00:52.91]Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:54.29]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:55.63]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:57.02]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[00:58.64]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[01:01.34]Also, you gotta make sure you drink your favorite gamer fuel.
[01:04.78]Just like this, I got... You're right, I did this guy!
[01:10.04]Come on, I got my gamer fuel!
[01:11.36]You fuckin' piece of shi- Oh, oh, I got him.
[01:19.99]Got him, got him!
[01:22.07]This next one is not so much a tip, as it is an absolute necessity.
[01:26.19]You wanna get on the final fuckin' guilt game.
[01:30.25]After every single match.
[01:32.59]And that's it.
[01:34.69]That's all I got.
[01:35.49]I think I'm hallucinating right now.
[01:40.31]Are you guys seeing bugs on the screen like a shitload of beetles?
[01:43.47]Like a thousand of them?
[01:46.28]I'm freaking out.
[01:47.74]I think I drank way too much of that shit, man.
[01:50.28]I'm losing it.
[01:51.72]Now there's mice all over the floor.
[01:54.46]There's mice everywhere.
[01:56.58]Oh!
[01:58.21]This whole room is on fire right now!
[02:00.01]This entire room's on fire!
[02:01.59]There's bugs and beetles and mice and... Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, what are you doing?
[02:05.19]Wait, what are you doing?
[02:06.15]I know Call of Duty Black Ops 2 came out.
[02:08.73]You're real excited.
[02:09.49]Just calm down.
[02:10.61]You don't have to worry about it.
[02:11.79]I'm gonna kill you.
[02:12.77]And burn your body and then eat it.
[02:15.30]Every single bit of it.
[02:16.30]I'm gonna swallow you whole, Grandpa.
[02:18.90]I'm gonna swallow you whole, Grandpa.
[02:23.08]Are you alright?
[02:24.24]Grandpa!
[02:25.22]Hey!
[02:25.86]Hey!
[02:27.54]What is it?
[02:28.42]You were just staring right through me.
[02:30.39]Are you alright?
[02:31.13]You're sweating right now.
[02:32.47]Hold on, I need to get you like a cloth.
[02:33.95]Alright, well, go get it.
[02:35.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:37.11]What is that?
[02:37.83]What the hell is that?
[02:38.87]That's just a drink.
[02:40.09]It's my gamer fuel.
[02:40.93]No, it's not.
[02:41.97]Yes, it is.
[02:42.95]I see vodka, gin, three empty energy drinks, and two empty coffees.
[02:47.33]Are you mixing drinks down here?
[02:48.69]What are you doing, man?
[02:49.90]Just put it down.
[02:50.68]It's not... Call of Duty Black Ops 2 only comes out once a year, so come on.
[02:55.64]Whatever.
[02:56.26]I'll see you later.
[02:57.42]Also, watch your step on the way out, because I may have peed.
[03:01.24]Yep.
[03:01.80]Oh, yep.
[03:02.28]Definitely.
