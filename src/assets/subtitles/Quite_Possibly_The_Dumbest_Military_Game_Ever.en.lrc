[00:09.21]Your mission is to find L. Ushin's hideout and eliminate him and his entire drug cartel.
[00:15.69]You do this as this guy.
[00:23.67]This guy doesn't see me?
[00:25.75]As long as you stay hidden in the bushes, enemies will not be able to see you?
[00:29.47]Oh, look.
[00:31.03]What the fuck, dude?
[00:32.15]Are you kidding me right now?
[00:38.23]There's gonna be some guy that's gonna walk over here.
[00:40.58]Yeah, oh, look, oh, I wonder, I can't believe that, where's, oh, there's somebody in that bush, I think.
[00:45.18]Oh, no, I'll just take my 2D gun and go, yeah!
[00:49.29]Whoa, whoa, whoa, press enter at the right place to, oh, I have to blow the bridge up.
[00:53.55]Okay.
[00:55.14]What?
[00:55.38]Did that seriously blow me up?
[00:57.62]It was a cutscene!
[00:58.52]That was just a cutscene!
[01:22.69]Three, two, one, boom!
[01:28.85]What was that?
[01:30.43]What was just on the side of the screen?
[01:33.09]What was that giant clay brick that just came over?
[01:36.27]What the fuck was that?
[01:39.59]Why would they have an explosion animation if you were just gonna take it out with a slab of clay?
[01:45.97]Why is this a lumberyard?
[01:47.27]Why are we at a lumberyard?
[01:53.24]Dude.
[01:54.44]Dude.
[01:56.92]No, dude.
[01:57.66]Like, you've got to be kidding me right now.
[02:02.43]You've shot down dozens of gang members, but you still aren't a single step closer to their leader.
[02:09.35]To make him come after you in person, try to make things more personal.
[02:13.43]That's a pretty nice car, dude.
[02:16.21]This is his recently imported from France super sports car.
[02:19.67]Trash it with your baseball bat before he returns.
[02:25.64]Excuse me, but are you making this up right now, or am I hearing you correctly?
[02:29.06]No, this is- this is- I'm not making this up.
[02:33.98]Attack it!
[02:36.46]Yeah, you show him!
[02:38.96]You show him what it's like to be a gang member!
[02:44.86]Mission failed?!
[02:47.18]I fucking trashed the thing!
[02:48.76]Dude, I trashed the car!
[02:54.08]Oh, you better hurry up and do it.
[02:57.58]How much more damage do you want me to do to this car?
[03:00.95]The car was like in a fucking junkyard by the time I was done with it.
[03:05.83]If I fail the mission right now... What?
[03:11.35]What happened to the enemies?
[03:13.15]What's going on?
[03:13.59]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:15.56]Easy, easy.
[03:16.28]Oh, it's an armored car.
[03:18.64]Hahaha.
[03:21.81]Well, you didn't really take the right, correct route to come get me.
[03:27.22]You actually just drove into a tree.
[03:29.24]Jesus, dude!
[03:41.90]So what happens when these all get actually exploded?
[03:44.08]What happens?
[03:45.86]Oh, there's another one.
[03:46.46]Look out.
[03:46.90]Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[03:47.86]I'm an animal.
[03:49.14]The cars in this game are animals, and they just drive into walls.
[03:54.33]Alright, I did it.
[03:55.29]And what's next?
[03:57.35]What's next, huh?
[03:57.83]What do you got for me?
[04:00.89]What do you got for me?
[04:01.47]I hear you.
[04:02.79]I hear you.
[04:03.54]Where are you?
[04:06.62]Oh, how you... I'm a car.
[04:10.60]Beep, beep, beep, beep.
[04:18.32]First car, where's the first car?
[04:19.76]First car, where you at?
[04:20.68]There you are, driving into walls.
[04:23.55]You ain't even gonna make it over here, and your pathing is so... Bye!
[04:33.06]Goodbye.
[04:35.30]Sometimes you find a bug in a game, and sometimes you just interdimensional time warp through every single map that they made.
[04:42.70]I have no idea why this is happening.
[04:44.53]We've landed.
[04:46.01]We're on Jupiter now.
[04:47.03]Welcome to Jupiter.
[04:47.85]Enjoy your stay.
[04:48.69]Please pick up your bags at the carousel.
[04:51.65]The fuck is actually going on right now?
[04:57.18]This just turned into a completely different game.
[05:00.34]I feel like I'm soul searching right now.
[05:02.66]Look at this.
[05:04.70]What happens if I go into like the great void?
[05:08.16]The great void awaits you.
[05:13.17]What's this?
[05:14.25]A new land?
