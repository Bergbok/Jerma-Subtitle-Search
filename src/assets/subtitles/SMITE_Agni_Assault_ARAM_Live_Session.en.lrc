[00:08.65]Zeus, Odin, Agni, oh, it's gonna be harsh.
[00:11.38]I'm so bad with Agni.
[00:12.86]I am terrible with Agni.
[00:15.24]All right, Boo, how do you play Agni?
[00:17.89]Tell me in like five steps or less.
[00:20.05]Oh, shit, okay.
[00:21.07]You stun by putting your one down and then putting any of your fire abilities on top of it.
[00:26.26]And then your two is a short-range damage ability.
[00:29.92]Your three is a dash.
[00:31.09]Your four is your meteor.
[00:32.61]Oh, dear.
[00:33.27]All random, all middle.
[00:36.73]Star's going to be spying on us.
[00:38.47]What is with this item menu?
[00:40.21]How do I even find items?
[00:43.53]All right, I'm just going to get boots, I think.
[00:45.39]I don't know.
[00:46.09]I never play Agni ever.
[00:50.49]Anybody but Agni.
[00:52.90]I would've taken anyone out of y'all guys, but... never mind.
[00:57.10]Yeah, I've seen you play Hibo before.
[00:58.36]Let's go with consumable.
[01:01.46]Oh, I actually specced the first one right.
[01:04.44]Okay.
[01:05.08]Alright, so what should I get?
[01:06.04]My two first?
[01:06.64]Too late, already did it.
[01:10.62]Look at this map!
[01:11.70]This map is insane!
[01:13.14]Yeah, looks cool.
[01:14.12]I wonder how much gold you get a second.
[01:15.88]So you cannot recall.
[01:16.98]Yeah, I have no idea what I'm buying.
[01:18.43]I'm just gonna buy stuff.
[01:22.70]Oh, you got Ares.
[01:23.58]It's not too terrible.
[01:25.78]Yeah, he's okay.
[01:26.24]I would have preferred, uh... I would have had Agni any day.
[01:30.16]I know.
[01:30.48]Can we, like, change characters?
[01:31.64]Like, I would be more comfortable with him.
[01:33.08]Oh, God.
[01:33.48]The Confucian sets in.
[01:34.90]Oh, anybody but Agni.
[01:37.05]You know what?
[01:37.37]I'm just going in.
[01:39.17]You want to go in?
[01:39.65]Oh, God.
[01:39.91]I can't.
[01:40.09]You want to go in?
[01:41.99]I'm scared.
[01:43.83]I can't find this book.
[01:44.97]I'm following this build guide, and I can't find this book.
[01:47.13]Who's Poseidon?
[01:47.77]Oh, Gavin's Poseidon.
[01:48.85]Oh, I wish I had... God.
[01:50.27]Gavin, you better carry...
[01:52.29]Magical power, maybe.
[01:54.50]Alright, here we go.
[01:55.54]There we go, I found it.
[01:56.50]Okay.
[01:57.22]Do we get lanes?
[01:57.94]Yeah, we get lanes.
[01:58.46]Okay.
[02:00.14]I have to read up on my build.
[02:01.16]I've never played Hebo before.
[02:04.12]Basically... Yeah.
[02:06.72]Yeah, really, really squishy.
[02:07.94]That's what I know.
[02:08.49]Oh, Star has Agni, too.
[02:10.13]Level up your 3 and your 1.
[02:12.03]Yeah, okay.
[02:12.93]Your 3 is the safest move.
[02:14.69]Yeah, I expect that first.
[02:17.27]Alright, let me get a nice... Oh my god.
[02:20.07]Oh god.
[02:20.65]Star, are you still on the call?
[02:23.01]Star's taking a beating.
[02:24.61]Did Star drop out of the call to not hear our strats?
[02:27.20]I think he's here.
[02:28.64]He's just spying on us.
[02:30.58]Yeah, he is.
[02:32.08]Okay, everybody move in now.
[02:33.64]Uh-oh.
[02:34.28]No, not move in.
[02:34.96]What do you mean move in now?
[02:36.95]I was trying to trick Star.
[02:39.29]If he is here.
[02:40.09]So do you have to die?
[02:41.55]Like, you have to die, right?
[02:43.43]Yeah.
[02:44.50]God, how the hell do you play Agni?
[02:47.39]That monkey, bro.
[02:50.85]Save your monkey for when the minions are dead.
[02:52.67]That's what I've been doing, yeah.
[02:55.69]Look at these minions.
[02:56.24]These minions are crazy looking.
[02:57.34]They're like demons.
[02:58.16]Look at this guy.
[02:59.56]They're demons.
[03:00.80]They're goddamn demons.
[03:04.25]Here comes an Agni.
[03:05.51]Rogue Agni.
[03:06.71]Dashing through.
[03:07.61]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:09.31]Oh, get Punisher.
[03:09.97]Punisher, Punisher.
[03:10.97]Yeah, Gavin.
[03:12.03]Yeah, high-res Gavin.
[03:13.37]Go on, Gavin.
[03:14.75]Clean it up.
[03:17.38]Ow.
[03:20.46]So we gotta get both towers and then, okay.
[03:22.82]Oh my god, they've got a Zeus.
[03:24.70]This is gonna take a while, I feel like.
[03:26.68]This is gonna be like an hour-long game.
[03:31.63]Ah.
[03:32.60]Dancing around so much here comes cage.

[04:06.16]It hurts!
[04:10.20]Alright, so we gotta get two towers?
[04:14.20]We gotta get high enough level where they're dead.
[04:17.32]For a long time.
[04:20.69]Holy sheep shit.
[04:23.71]This is gonna be tough.
[04:26.93]We got this.
[04:27.91]I need more mana.
[04:29.23]Is it just Zeus?
[04:29.79]Just Zeus?
[04:32.19]Boo's running.
[04:33.69]He's gonna try to suicide, but Zeus is chasing him.
[04:38.44]Get that.
[04:38.94]Get that son of a... Get him.
[04:40.54]Boo, turn around.
[04:42.04]Boo, turn around.
[04:42.62]Hit him once.
[04:43.04]I got him.
[04:43.86]I got him.
[04:44.22]I got him.
[04:48.97]Boo's just like running into the tower.
[04:50.47]I was wondering what you were doing.
[04:54.17]I mean if you feed the kill to the tower then they don't get any XP or gold for it.
[04:57.64]Are you sure?
[04:59.94]But he wasn't hitting me.
[05:00.66]I'm too tanky.
[05:02.42]It's like four towers.
[05:05.12]We should all build Stone of Gaia so we just have permanent health regen.
[05:11.91]Oh, I'll get Bracer Replenishment.
[05:13.03]There we go.
[05:13.43]That'll be good.
[05:14.11]That's perfect for me.
[05:17.06]Oh, going in on the Agni, going in on the Agni.
[05:20.56]Nice.
[05:22.22]No, I'm in the cage!
[05:23.98]He'll die fast.
[05:24.92]What?
[05:25.82]Can't believe I got him.
[05:27.07]Nice.
[05:28.37]He jumped out.
[05:29.79]Oh, I'm going down, see you later.
[05:32.87]Oh boy, whole team.
[05:34.61]This is gonna get really interesting really quickly here.

[05:41.42]There you are.
[05:41.90]We got magic.
[05:44.50]Yeah, that Sears is doing a lot of damage.
[05:45.82]I'm following this one guy that may just be crap, but it's better than nothing.
[05:50.47]Uh-oh, they're on the tower.
[05:55.67]I'll make it happen, Boo, make it happen.
[05:57.11]I'm on the move.
[05:59.56]Make it happen.
[06:00.04]Let's go back to the action, baby.
[06:04.63]Uh-oh, Boo.
[06:04.97]Oh, Boo.
[06:05.79]Be careful.
[06:06.75]Get that kill on him.
[06:08.33]Yes.
[06:09.01]Kill.
[06:10.25]Good job, Boo.
[06:10.83]All right.
[06:11.09]We're up.

[06:18.46]Get a move on.
[06:21.02]I don't want to.
[06:21.54]Kelly.
[06:23.30]All right.
[06:24.38]Oh, boy.
[06:25.00]There it goes.
[06:26.46]That was my bad.
[06:30.54]Get out of here.
[06:31.18]Uh-oh.
[06:32.32]Big baby.
[06:33.72]How did I not?
[06:34.60]Oh, she ages.

[06:36.38]Oh, no.
[06:38.46]I'm dead.
[06:41.42]Get that Agni.
[06:42.68]Just hit him.
[06:44.36]Oh, come on.
[06:44.94]Nice job.
[06:47.16]I can't go back.
[06:48.62]Yeah, we've got to attack that tower now.
[06:50.88]There's three down.
[06:51.90]Go, go, go, go.
[06:53.38]I wish one of us had a damn heal.
[06:55.86]Yeah, I'm getting Bracelet Replenishment.
[06:57.18]I should have got that earlier.
[06:58.14]I didn't think regen would be as important as it would be.
[07:02.63]Stone a guy, it would be good.
[07:05.43]Oh god.
[07:05.77]Are we gonna get the tower?
[07:06.49]Ah, he hurts.
[07:07.40]It hurts.
[07:08.36]Get that tower, Taric.
[07:10.12]I'm tanking it.
[07:11.06]I can't tank it.
[07:12.52]It's almost down.
[07:13.02]It's almost down.
[07:14.56]Meditation would be okay in this mode.
[07:16.64]Yeah.
[07:19.52]Let's get some defense.
[07:24.25]I got some medias.
[07:26.29]That Kali is gonna eat media.
[07:29.15]That Kali keeps killing me.
[07:32.03]Oh, we're gonna have five down here.
[07:34.58]I got that.
[07:36.62]What else?
[07:37.68]How did I miss?
[07:39.58]Come on.
[07:39.96]I'm trying.
[07:42.32]It's just me and her.
[07:43.42]It's just me and the Kelly.
[07:45.77]Let's see.
[07:51.61]Yeah, say goodbye to your lane, bro.
[07:54.49]Not sure if this is the best call, but I'll try it.
[07:58.95]Damn it!
[08:03.97]I'm coming back.
[08:04.59]I'm pushing her up, pushing her up.
[08:09.09]Here comes Vamana.
[08:14.45]What if there was a fire giant?
[08:19.72]Jim, I'm coming.
[08:21.00]Help me!
[08:23.18]Kali's almost dead.
[08:26.38]The heal is pretty damn good now.
[08:29.40]I need to wait for these things to charge up.
[08:31.63]Alright, coming back.
[08:34.95]I'm gonna try and hit Kali.
[08:37.57]We gonna put some damage on this tower?
[08:39.01]We're gonna punish.
[08:43.87]Ah, it hurts.
[08:44.95]It hurts.
[08:49.26]Oh, lord.
[08:51.64]It hurts when I pee.
[08:53.30]Oh, Gavin!
[08:55.80]Gavin!
[08:57.44]Retreat, dudes.
[08:57.92]I'm coming.
[09:03.64]Okay, listen.
[09:04.72]Damn, I got her.
[09:05.42]Nice.
[09:06.46]Get me the hell out of there.
[09:09.85]Oh god, I make... No!
[09:14.33]Fancy footwork!
[09:15.35]Fancy footwork!
[09:16.55]I got the stun!
[09:17.27]I got the stun!
[09:23.05]Get the Odin first.
[09:24.37]Oh, nice wave.
[09:27.62]Let's go with the rod.
[09:30.94]One more, one more.
[09:33.88]Kill this Agni, and then we'll push tower.
[09:36.76]Oh, you guys are gonna get that tower?
[09:38.79]Damn it, I missed.
[09:39.59]Get star!
[09:40.97]Where are we pushing?
[09:42.49]Oh, it's a deicide, it's a deicide, get the tower!
[09:45.13]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[09:46.13]Boo, I need my heals.
[09:47.07]Oh, there's so much time.
[09:48.21]There's so much time right now.
[09:49.91]Oh my god, but I'm dead though.
[09:51.65]You guys are all so dead.
[09:53.03]Oh, lovely regen.
[09:57.24]Boo, you have to, right?
[10:00.21]Just do it.
[10:01.19]You have to, right?
[10:01.89]Even if you die.
[10:03.09]Even if you guys die, this tower should go down.
[10:07.87]Oh, Kali's up.
[10:10.02]Retreat.
[10:11.54]No.
[10:12.48]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:13.54]Get the tower.
[10:14.36]Good job.
[10:15.42]Good job.
[10:16.38]Beautiful.
[10:17.16]I think we can kill him.
[10:17.78]Now run.
[10:21.08]I'm up.
[10:21.98]Nice job.
[10:22.69]Oh, good job.
[10:23.65]Good job, guys.
[10:24.97]There we go.
[10:25.67]Big plays.
[10:26.15]Oh, yeah.
[10:26.81]Big plays.
[10:27.29]Phoenixed.
[10:30.92]Here comes Zeus.
[10:32.90]He's real angry.
[10:33.58]He wants a double.
[10:34.22]Yeah, it's pretty much all about the... just going in.
[10:38.58]Even if you die from the tower, it's still... it's worth it because you have to get the towers down.
[10:48.10]I have 34 HP!
[10:48.90]Alright, we just don't want to all wipe and give them full free reign to do the same thing back to us.
[10:55.97]So, we got to try to stay alive.
[10:57.51]Oh, get tripled!
[10:58.75]That's me.
[11:02.58]Hi guys.
[11:03.94]Oh my goodness gracious, I came out and insta-died.
[11:10.00]I did get, I did help though.
[11:17.72]I'm killing, that's what I'm doing.
[11:21.07]I think Boo's killing.
[11:22.47]Oh, Boo.
[11:22.85]I'm here to fight it.
[11:27.42]Well, that was unnecessary.
[11:29.98]Oh, come on.
[11:30.44]One hit.
[11:30.94]Got her.
[11:31.86]I need to buy an Aegis.
[11:34.75]Right.
[11:35.43]I'm going to regenerate it.
[11:38.35]You're there?
[11:38.93]Alright.
[11:40.65]The Odin's pretty low.
[11:41.49]Ah, I missed.
[11:43.33]If I chain him, he'll die.
[11:45.05]Oh, nice.
[11:47.62]He's done.
[11:50.68]Gotta make this happen.
[11:53.24]Can't you use the portal in this one?
[11:55.14]That's what I was wondering, if you could use a portal somehow to get back.
[11:58.54]You probably can.
[11:59.20]If I can just catch this guy.
[12:00.34]They got three down?
[12:01.94]Three down.
[12:06.51]Aggie's dead.
[12:07.19]Yep.
[12:08.07]Oh, we gotta get them all here, gotta get them all here.
[12:09.37]Nice, now we push.
[12:10.81]That's it, that's it, we're gonna get it, we're gonna get the minute, we're gonna get Phoenix.
[12:13.99]Somebody's about to come up in a few seconds.
[12:15.97]We got Zeus, Zeus in six seconds, Zeus in six seconds.
[12:17.97]Zeus will die, we'll just, we'll just smash Zeus.
[12:19.77]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
[12:21.86]Come on, minions!
[12:23.88]Let's go!
[12:24.32]I'm on the move.
[12:30.53]Get the phoenix!
[12:31.65]I got the minions, I got the minions.
[12:33.05]Here comes the Zeus ult.
[12:33.75]Oh, you got it easy.
[12:35.21]That was easy.
[12:35.79]Oh, that hurt.
[12:37.79]I'm on the move.
[12:40.65]Now it's just the minotaur.
[12:42.34]Off you move.
[12:43.24]Oh shit, yeah.
[12:44.42]Ow.
[12:45.56]Ow, ow, ow.
[12:45.96]He's detonating way too fast.
[12:47.72]Does he get a bunch of cooldown reduction?
[12:49.24]No, he's just detonating before his... Should we dive the minotaur or what do you think?
[12:54.67]Do we just dive the Minotaur?
[12:55.57]I don't know, Boo's pretty weak, Jerma's pretty weak.
[12:58.08]I know, but I mean, I'm going to drop some Meteors on him.
[13:01.20]We're going to have fire minions soon too.
[13:03.06]Guys, I'm coming in hot.
[13:04.76]Oh, jeez.
[13:06.92]Plus the Minotaur's on Boo, right?
[13:08.45]Oh, Boo!
[13:08.85]I almost killed him.
[13:14.03]Did you get anyone?
[13:14.73]No, I almost got the Zeus.
[13:16.17]They can't regen though, they can't regen, so that's fine.
[13:26.20]Oh boy.
[13:27.64]Bang.
[13:31.90]I'm running away.
[13:32.54]Good job.
[13:33.34]Oh, I'm caged.

[13:34.23]I'm caged.
[13:34.55]I'm caged.
[13:36.19]Just run around.
[13:37.31]Run away.
[13:37.67]Just fight him.
[13:38.57]I can't.
[13:40.97]Go for the Zeus.
[13:41.53]He's more dangerous.
[13:42.99]I mean, you don't have to.
[13:45.81]Actually, just fall back.
[13:46.55]I'm falling back.
[13:49.71]Run.
