[00:02.04]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:03.56]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:07.71]And tonight, gonna be playing as the... So, what I want to talk about today, guys, is a few things.
[00:14.82]And, uh... Some things are really bad in this video.
[00:18.24]Some of the things we're gonna talk about are not cool.
[00:20.89]But you got to deal with it.
[00:21.61]You have to deal with these problems if you are going to have a computer that is custom built.
[00:26.61]It's just things like this are going to happen.
[00:28.95]So let's start from the very beginning here.
[00:31.09]You probably watched a video from like two or three weeks ago where I was like building a supercomputer, going to the micro center, going to get a bunch of parts.
[00:38.04]It's going to be so sick.
[00:39.84]And I did that.
[00:40.86]And I had it built in the thing like shit the bed last night.
[00:45.53]Like, I had a motherboard problem last night.
[00:47.99]I don't know what's going on.
[00:49.19]I think the motherboard might be bad.
[00:50.51]It might be a crappy... I don't know.
[00:52.61]I don't know.
[00:53.07]All I know is that it doesn't work, and I'm currently recording this on my laptop.
[00:57.49]So, if this video is not 1080p, I sincerely apologize.
[01:02.27]I'm gonna try to do it, so it really could be 1080p.
[01:04.09]It might not.
[01:05.11]It might not, but it might be.
[01:07.13]If you've been following this whole me showing pictures of it, me talking about it, then you'll know that when you run into a problem like this with a computer, when you have an issue, if you custom build a computer, if you have somebody build it for you, whatever, if you have a custom built PC, when you run into a problem like this,
[01:23.10]You want to just pick the thing up and like spike it through a fucking window like that last night when this was happening and it was like 12 hours were going by I was having so many problems I was trying to figure out what the hell was going on doing everything I could possibly think of and nothing was working I couldn't get anything to really work the way I wanted it to and it was just a nightmare and if this thing had a tail
[01:43.27]If this computer had a tail, I would have grabbed it, spun around a bunch of times, and just let go and SHUT UP GEEBOWSER into whatever it was going to fucking run into.
[01:53.55]It was that close.
[01:54.27]Good thing I didn't install a tail on this PC.
[01:58.13]And actually, I just thought of something.
[02:00.72]what if you took what if you took a computer bear with me for a second what if you took a computer and you put a little tail on it and then you gave it ears on the front and put whiskers on the front too so it was like a giant like mouse that would be pretty funny wouldn't it or am I is this totally just inaccurate but that probably wouldn't be funny at all alright forget it
[02:20.31]But the computer is currently being fixed.
[02:22.57]It's gonna be fine in probably a day or so.
[02:24.83]I just haven't really been able to do very much this last couple of days, which sucks, because I got a whole lot of stuff going on.
[02:31.21]There's a whole lot of videos I'm making in the process of... I was in the process of making them before the video dumped the bed, like, dumped its pants and shit its diaper in the bed.
[02:40.32]Like, there are at least a few videos, and thank God...
[02:43.64]that I backed up all this stuff.
[02:45.25]If you guys have never seen my video on backing up your hard drive, then go watch it.
[02:49.91]Well, you don't really even have to go watch it.
[02:51.31]Just back up your hard drives with information you don't want to lose.
[02:54.95]Because if I had lost a bunch of this stuff for videos that I'm currently working on right now, like, I don't even know.
[03:03.75]I can't even imagine my infuriation if that were to happen.
[03:09.01]Anyways, we're gonna move on.
[03:11.05]We're gonna talk about the second thing I wanted to bring up in this video, which is a little better and a little nicer and a little more uplifting than the previous few minutes or a couple minutes.
[03:20.74]And that's the TF2 mix-up.
[03:22.36]TF2 mix-up number six.
[03:24.64]I got to be a part of this year, so it was really, really cool, really awesome.
[03:27.19]If you don't know what the TF2 mix-up is, they get a bunch of YouTubers and some gaming developers, a couple people from Valve end up showing up, and we play matches against each other, and it's all recorded, it's all captured, and it's all for charity.
[03:38.84]So I was able to be a part of it this year,
[03:41.06]I was actually on Captain Sparkle's team.
[03:43.48]Link will be in the description if you want to watch the videos that were recorded during this segment of time we were playing for the mix-up.
[03:50.83]There's going to be, I think, three or four different rounds that Sparkles is going to be uploading, so if you want to check out their perspective from our end, our team,
[04:01.18]go to Sparkle's channel, go to that video that's going to be in the description.
[04:04.16]There'll be a link there.
[04:05.06]You can't miss it.
[04:05.90]You're going to take a right on 2nd Street.
[04:08.14]If you see the McDonald's, you went too far, and then take a left at those lights, and you're going to be at Captain Sparkle's channel.
[04:13.61]So that's where you want to go if you want to see that, and we're going to move on to talk about something else in this video.
[04:20.36]is the fact that holiday crates are dropping now.
[04:23.42]Holiday crates are dropping all over the place.
[04:25.18]I just got some.
[04:25.92]I might even have gotten one in this video.
[04:27.78]I don't even know if I show the death or not.
[04:30.03]And I think they've been dropping for a little over a week.
[04:33.13]I think December 6th is when they were added, so like a week and a few days since they have been dropping.
[04:38.67]But what this means...
[04:40.57]the initial hypothesis that we are going to be getting three updates in three months is actually potentially going to come true.
[04:47.28]So, we are probably going to see the holiday Christmas-miss-miss, whatever you want to call it, TF2 update fairly soon here.
[04:55.04]And everybody can cross their fingers and hope that we get some pretty cool stuff, because there really has never been a holiday-themed TF2 update.
[05:04.43]that didn't give us something cool.
[05:06.57]They've always introduced at least a couple of new weapons, at least a couple of new maps or new modes.
[05:12.59]They've always released something cool for the Christmas and holiday season.
[05:16.97]So here's hoping that these holiday crates coming around is a sign that the update is sort of looming.
[05:25.31]And with that, that is going to wrap up the video.
[05:27.97]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:29.25]I really do appreciate it.
[05:30.57]Stay tuned for the holiday animation video that I was talking about.
[05:35.31]That should be ready to roll here in the next week or so.
[05:39.41]I think I touched upon this once, but I'll reiterate it one more time.
[05:43.35]There's going to be an animation on the channel.
[05:44.73]It's going to be a grandpa video.
[05:46.33]It's going to be grandpa animated.
[05:48.01]That's all I'm going to say.
[05:49.29]I'm not going to say anything more about it.
[05:50.85]You'll just see it in your sub box when you see it.
[05:53.37]A lot of time has gone into this.
[05:54.82]The animator has been spending a ton of his time putting it together.
[05:59.04]And I hope you guys enjoy it.
[06:00.04]You'll see it when you see it.
[06:01.44]So that's it.
[06:02.02]So everybody, thank you so much for watching.
[06:03.18]I really appreciate it.
[06:04.46]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[06:05.74]And of course, take care, everybody.
[06:12.01]I just did that because I don't have any of the files.
[06:15.95]The sound files or the Photoshop files.
[06:17.61]There's probably not even a thumbnail on this video either.
[06:20.01]Because I don't have the files.
[06:22.22]Okay, well, bye.
