[00:28.35]When I find you, you're in big trouble.
[00:30.31]My AI pathing only has me walking in one, uh, seven minutes is all I give you.
[00:36.73]Anybody, you got anything?
[00:37.73]You got anything we can just, like, throw down there just to, like, startle him?
[00:39.96]He's literally, he's just stuck.
[00:41.20]He's stuck.
[00:42.38]Yeah.

[02:20.15]I can't... I couldn't give him the poison.
[02:22.29]Hold X to, like, grab him.
[02:24.61]Hold on.
[02:25.55]I forget what we have to do here.
[02:27.90]Oh, it's a red herb.

[02:30.30]It's broken.
[02:30.86]Something's broken.
[02:31.40]I don't want the red herb.
[02:33.56]Smash this.
[02:35.94]Alright, this is a giant rifle here.
[02:41.03]This is legitimately like... We're not hiding.
[02:44.74]What do you mean there's no point in hiding?
[02:46.98]Alright, I'm about to drop, like, a fucking nuke right next to you.
[02:53.50]I need to get to, like, a good spot.
[02:54.62]He's dancing.
[02:55.36]He's literally dancing.
[02:56.80]I think we can, like... Oh, no, we can... I remember.
[02:58.58]We can, like, turn off the lights.
[03:01.86]And he's like, ah, where are you?
[03:03.22]I'm an idiot.
[03:04.85]Okay, so come over here.
[03:05.85]Are these the lights?
[03:06.63]Yeah, it's dark over here.
[03:07.57]Watch, he's gonna go, oh, what the, oh, I can't, never mind.
[03:12.91]I think I'm dying.
[03:15.86]I think I'm dead.
[03:16.60]You killed me.
[03:17.34]Saturation.
[03:21.24]Saturation.
[03:30.99]I'm dead.
[03:31.31]You're dead.
[03:42.54]I thought that was for you.
[03:45.70]There is no way we would be able to stand on this lava rock inside the volcano.
[03:50.73]No, what are you talking about?
[03:51.77]It's probably like a cool, clean, chill 68 degrees right here.
[03:57.09]We got like a high of like 70.
[03:59.92]Yeah, it's probably like 60, 70 degrees right now.
[04:02.88]It definitely would not be like over 180, like 3, 5, 600,000 degrees.
[04:05.20]Am I... Why am I on this?
[04:06.10]I have to make my way around.
[04:07.44]What the fuck?
[04:07.94]Oh!
[04:08.00]Oh!
[04:21.34]Wait, me?
[04:22.44]What?
[04:22.76]Hold on.
[04:24.16]What?
[04:24.32]Climb up.
[04:25.56]Climb up.
[04:27.00]I can't.
[04:28.52]I'm having trouble doing this.
[04:32.91]My hand's getting tired.
[04:34.83]I'm coming.
[04:35.43]I have to tap this shit.
[04:39.85]Please.
[04:40.25]Oh my god.
[04:40.57]I actually pulled myself.
[04:41.37]Are you safe or something?
[04:50.33]be able to do that in real life.
[04:56.13]That rock is like 12,000 pounds.
[04:59.57]There's no way you punch that rock.
[05:03.72]I just spit everywhere.
[05:05.94]You're like punching a fucking rock.
[05:07.92]Like Rocky Balboa.
[05:18.01]My head is gonna explode.
[05:23.32]What the fuck just happened?
[05:27.42]Get over there and start punching the fucking rock.
[05:30.52]Here we go.
[05:31.64]This rock is a hundred times bigger than me.
[05:36.51]He's like making his way over to you.
[05:39.29]This is the only way you're gonna do it in time.
[05:42.52]He's like right behind you, dude.
[05:45.20]You're so dead.
[05:48.02]Okay, okay.
[05:55.17]Something tells me we're doing something wrong.
[05:58.73]But I'm pretty sure if we, like, walk near him, he's just gonna... Um, this is not good.
[06:04.34]He's just in the way.
[06:06.44]Is there anything we can do?
[06:08.18]Wait, can you... I'm going for it.
[06:11.84]I'm going for it.
[06:12.94]What if he just fell in the lava?
[06:17.22]Will you stop swinging at, like, nothing nothing?
[06:20.88]No, no, no, that was a bad idea.
[06:23.36]Yeah, what is this dumbass doing?
[06:26.48]Looks like he's painting a mural on the wall.
[06:29.58]Oh god.
[06:30.16]Oh, here he comes now.
[06:31.67]Oh, this is over.
[06:33.05]This is it.
[06:34.43]Hold on.
[06:34.93]This is it.
[06:35.57]This is it.
[06:35.91]We gotta go now.
[06:36.79]We gotta go now.
[06:37.29]We gotta go now.
