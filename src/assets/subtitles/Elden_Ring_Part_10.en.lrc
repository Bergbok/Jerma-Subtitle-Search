[00:00.59]Hey, good afternoon.
[00:01.65]Ah, it's evening.
[00:02.77]Never mind.
[00:05.69]Yeah, I'm here.
[00:08.64]It's really late.
[00:09.34]Yeah, it is.
[00:12.62]It ain't no time like the present to play Elden Ring.
[00:22.41]Elden Ring.
[00:22.97]Yeah, we streamed yesterday.
[00:27.17]When I say we, I mean me.
[00:28.23]At the end of that stream, I said that Tuesday is what you probably could expect.
[00:33.45]But... I want to go now.
[00:38.26]So we're doing it now.
[00:41.86]We're very, very early.
[00:43.16]Because I'm supposed to stream tomorrow.
[00:45.86]But I'm like, you know what?
[00:46.60]No.
[00:47.04]Streaming tonight.
[00:48.50]So it's very, very early to tomorrow's stream.
[00:52.48]But this is a very late stream.
[00:54.58]Starting at like 7.15.
[00:56.77]Pacific.
[00:58.57]So I'll tell you.
[00:59.71]I have... Makes sense if you're like, you know what, dude?
[01:04.85]I don't know if... I mean... I'll probably be here for like an hour or two.
[01:09.78]That's alright.
[01:10.24]I don't... Okay.
[01:10.90]I don't think this is gonna be like a 10-hour stream.
[01:14.40]I'm just playing.
[01:15.10]I'm just gonna jump in.
[01:15.88]I'm gonna play.
[01:16.38]I'm gonna hang out.
[01:17.70]Get some more progress done.
[01:19.28]In the volcano manner.
[01:23.74]And look, after four or five hours, we'll figure it out.
[01:26.58]Whatever.
[01:26.86]You guys are all addicted.
[01:31.62]That's why you're here.
[01:35.16]Well, you know, that's whatever.
[01:38.00]The game's fun, and there's a bunch of people think it's fun.
[01:40.29]400,000 concurrent people still playing the game, by the way.
[01:46.59]We're all here, so let's just hang out.
[01:52.76]Is this the guy that says Aaron?
[01:55.20]Well, it used to be.
[01:58.60]I've kind of moved on from that kind of material.
[02:02.76]Moved on to an Elden Ring streamer.
[02:04.16]So you're probably going to get some Elden Ring kind of references.
[02:08.24]I would appreciate it if those of you that are here now can say things instead of like Aaron.
[02:13.53]You know, like praise the sun and not maidenless and that kind of thing.
[02:17.73]Trying to change my brand a little here.
[02:21.65]I would appreciate it if nobody said, like, you know, nobody said Aaron anymore.
[02:24.69]We're trying to move on to other things.
[02:27.50]We're gonna move on to Elden Ring stuff.
[02:31.12]Aaron Ring.
[02:33.72]Alright, we're in the Volcano Manor.
[02:35.20]Do I really need an intro?
[02:36.82]I stopped streaming, like, less than 24 hours ago, so let's just keep going.
[02:41.73]What about doi doi doi?
[02:43.57]No, that's not what we're doing anymore.
[02:51.53]Please.
[02:54.49]I don't even know what that means.
[02:56.63]I don't know how... I don't know how to do it.
[02:58.51]Just sit here for 20 more minutes talking about your old noises.
[03:08.73]You know how weird that is to think about?
[03:10.37]Oh, man, like... Those old jokes.
[03:13.44]Oh, those jokes from, you know, years past.
[03:16.58]Those noises.
[03:19.01]They're not even jokes, right?
[03:21.09]Like, a lot of my old material is sound effects.
[03:26.13]Just sound effects.
[03:28.79]Oh, that classic Jerma985 joke.
[03:31.77]Oh, Jerma985 is a comedian?
[03:34.29]Yeah, classic comedian.
[03:36.26]What's some of his material?
[03:38.06]Oh, man, he's got this amazing routine where he sits there and... Are you ready?
[03:44.10]It's insane.
[03:45.82]So he's sitting there and he goes...
[03:51.17]Yeah?
[03:52.63]Yeah, that's it.
[03:54.63]Does he do anything else?
[03:56.64]Well, I mean, his old stuff was like, I mean, it's alright.
[03:59.30]He did a dollhouse.
[04:01.32]He just did a dollhouse.
[04:02.18]He's got baseball coming up, but... Yeah, he used to make, like, noises.
[04:09.06]Alright, man.
[04:10.70]So you're saying I should start watching the material from, like, 2017 and onward?
[04:16.21]Nah, maybe a little bit later?
[04:18.52]Maybe like 2018, 2019 is when he stopped doing noises for content, but he still does it.
[04:25.16]Anyways.
[04:26.62]I like those noises, and I'm gonna stick to them.
[04:28.64]How you doing?
[04:34.34]Remember where we were?
[04:35.18]We were here.
[04:40.34]Those noises were from like a month ago.
[04:48.88]Watch from shpee nest onwards, right?
[04:51.35]Yeah.
[04:54.89]You do yoga?
[04:55.99]I can't do yoga.
[04:57.21]I can't.
[04:57.73]My body physically can't move that way.
[05:00.65]You should respect the character.
[05:01.81]This character has been incredible.
[05:03.79]Respect the character.
[05:05.98]Respect the character.
[05:06.78]This character is amazing.
[05:13.80]Alright, so the last thing we did...
[05:15.91]Alright, so last thing we did.
[05:16.85]We killed the boss that was in this room.
[05:20.07]I think there's a way I can go over here maybe.
[05:23.93]What is this?
[05:24.21]This is really late.
[05:25.07]Yeah, this is late night stream.
[05:28.53]Doing a late night.
[05:30.05]At least maybe.
[05:30.84]I don't know.
[05:31.14]After like three or four hours.
[05:31.96]I just want to play.
[05:32.68]And I'm not going to play without you.
[05:34.80]Unless I do Limgrave.
[05:36.00]I'm not doing Limgrave another day.
[05:40.20]You know, I thought about, oh man, maybe I'll just go tomorrow.
[05:44.31]And I'll do Limgrave again today.
[05:46.59]On my own.
[05:47.33]On another guy.
[05:48.23]No.
[05:52.73]I stepped on this before the stream started.
[05:54.81]So I think, no, it's here.
[05:55.71]Sorry, played without you for 10 seconds before the stream started.
[05:59.81]Sorry, sorry about that.
[06:01.01]We need a me strong stream.
[06:10.50]Maybe.
[06:10.94]Alright, let's go.
[06:11.72]This game, I love it.
[06:13.12]Let's go.
[06:13.46]A lot of candles.
[06:25.12]You know?
[06:27.83]A thing next to the piano.
[06:30.69]The piano-like object.
[06:36.15]What is that?
[06:39.02]Good villain here.
[06:39.66]I just combed it back.
[06:46.19]Nothing over here.
[06:46.91]Okay.
[06:53.91]Resident sleeper.
[06:54.61]This stream hasn't even been on for fucking five minutes.
[07:01.36]You know what?
[07:01.72]That's so funny.
[07:05.22]You guys don't have any idea how much power you really hold.
[07:10.53]Like, oh, I'm just a random viewer in a sea of people.
[07:14.49]You hold a lot of power over the people that are streaming.
[07:18.47]I'm telling you right now, when a streamer looks over and sees Resident Sleeper, they have an internal panic attack.
[07:25.13]They're like, what's happening?
[07:26.35]Why does this person think my stream sucks?
[07:28.63]My stream's boring.
[07:29.71]Why?
[07:30.03]What happened?
[07:30.73]I need to do something.
[07:31.31]I gotta do something now.
[07:32.53]I gotta wake that person up.
[07:33.85]I gotta make like a joke.
[07:34.77]I gotta do something.
[07:36.01]You hold a lot of power.
[07:37.60]But I'm gonna choose to ignore you.
[07:45.74]What is this wacky, twisting hallway thing?
[07:48.88]Am I just walking in circles?
[07:50.08]There's nothing here?
[07:50.80]How can there be no items here?
[07:55.81]None at all.
[07:56.59]Zero.
[07:57.39]There's gotta be a secret wall, right?
[08:00.77]You gotta go back to your old material, man.
[08:05.73]Ooh.
[08:06.83]Alright, I can go that way.
[08:10.49]Yeah, dude, your old material was way better.
[08:15.50]Isn't there another way I could go?
[08:16.42]Hold on.
[08:19.33]Can I seriously?
[08:20.37]Is there nothing here?
[08:21.17]That feels impossible, but whatever.
[08:24.25]These are really romantic candles.
[08:30.67]No, it probably stinks up here.
[08:36.12]Ah, yeah, boss.
[08:36.76]I filled the room with red candles like you wanted.
[08:41.90]Jerry.
[08:44.12]You fucking idiot.
[08:45.93]Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from Yankee Candle and put it in every room?
[08:52.91]We have to- we're gonna have to fucking open the windows and not come back here for like a week.
[08:59.18]Which by the way, that's one of the most power- that's one of the most powerful of all the candles, and I hate them.
[09:04.90]I- I swear to god, I can tell.
[09:07.06]I can tell when a neighbor lights one of those candles.
[09:12.05]It drives me crazy.
[09:15.57]That like cinnamon, it's like the fall cinnamon cider apple one.
[09:20.37]It's just like, no, I like it for like a second, but I don't want to fill my whole neighborhood with that.
[09:28.45]Wait.
[09:32.57]To jump in the lava.
[09:34.87]Oh, what's my death count at right now?
[09:41.56]What is it?
[09:41.88]I don't know.
[09:42.36]What does it even add?
[09:46.21]Am I under 500 deaths?
[09:49.31]I didn't even say it went too fast.
[09:50.95]How many deaths are there?
[09:53.26]I don't have 700 deaths.
[09:54.56]No, I don't.
[09:57.64]493.
[09:57.66]Does anybody know how many times I died in Sekiro or Dark Souls 3?
[10:06.24]Alright, well, I'm going down here.
[10:10.72]Then here.
[10:13.73]I don't think I died more than like 150 times in Dark Souls 3.
[10:16.99]It was like 200.
[10:18.80]Have I been in here?
[10:29.90]Well, shit.
[10:30.64]I guess not.
[10:34.12]Okay, well.
[10:36.16]Go in here.
[10:39.50]How many was Sekiro?
[10:42.85]What the f- what the fuck I was over there?
[10:44.75]Shit.
[10:45.17]Alright, never mind.
[10:45.79]Alright, I'm going back up.
[10:48.21]I'm going- I walked in a circle.
[10:50.11]I walked in a- I literally walked in a circle.
[10:55.81]242.
[10:55.97]I can't- well, here's the thing.
[11:02.15]This game is also like five times as long as all the Souls games.
[11:05.30]So, I- that makes sense.
[11:15.11]Alright, let's go up that way.
[11:16.55]There's nothing over there.
[11:17.13]I don't know why you would want to drop down there.
[11:23.29]That's a big rune.
[11:27.11]So I did look up.
[11:29.20]Yeah, yeah, he's using a guide.
[11:30.56]No.
[11:30.88]This is beautiful, though.
[11:32.84]I love that.
[11:34.12]You guys ever just put on YouTube videos of that weird gooey lava just falling down and somebody hitting it with a stick?
[11:42.02]I want to do that.
[11:47.40]I wonder, like, where you do that.
[11:48.64]Like, those videos of the people, like, oh, and here's, you take a look, and it's, like, really slow-moving, gooey, like, almost, like, cookie batter.
[11:57.10]And they, like, knock it with a stick, and it's, like, goopy, and it, like, breaks up, and... I would do that for, like, three or four hours, and that would be a vacation.
[12:05.04]Like, that's what I wanted to do on vacation.
[12:12.66]I wouldn't care about anything else.
[12:17.25]You'd fall in.
[12:18.21]I'm not gonna, I wouldn't fall in the lava.
[12:20.27]It moves at like 0.2 miles per hour.
[12:24.21]I'm not gonna fall in the lava.
[12:26.69]Why would that happen?
[12:31.44]Yes, you would.
[12:32.20]No, I would not fall in the lava.
[12:34.70]Why do you guys think, okay.
[12:39.00]Why do you guys think that I like need to ride a bicycle with training wheels on it still?
[12:45.45]So I was riding my bike yesterday.
[12:47.21]Oh, he has to have training wheels on.
[12:49.97]He's brainless.
[12:52.41]No, I can ride a bike normally.
[12:54.63]I'm not going to fall into the lava.
[12:57.04]What am I, just going to sit there and stare at it and just lean forward until I face first, like put my face in the cake?
[13:04.02]What are you talking about?
[13:07.66]Yeah, I'm going to ride on my training wheels tricycle just into the lava and fall forward.
[13:20.54]This is so cool.
[13:23.26]I would go on vacation here.
[13:30.01]That would be the ultimate fall joke.
[13:35.51]I wouldn't.
[13:36.05]That would be awful.
[13:42.81]They gotta make, like, candy that's like this, right?
[13:46.97]Is it like a... And I don't want the lava candy that's like cinnamon, red cinnamon apple bullshit, okay?
[13:53.06]Let me be very clear about that.
[13:54.86]They make, like, lava candy, and it's red cinnamon bullshit.
[14:02.81]Why does everything have... No, I don't... Alright, this looks... I don't like this.
[14:10.87]This looks like a boss place.
[14:14.84]Cinnamon's good.
[14:16.95]I, you know, I have not jumped onto the cinnamon train.
[14:20.81]I'm sorry.
[14:22.31]I really kind of don't like it.
[14:24.25]It just overpowers everything that it touches.
[14:27.27]Oh, you want a latte?
[14:28.69]Yeah, sure, I'll take it.
[14:29.41]No, no, no, please, can I just only taste cinnamon?
[14:31.11]Put, like, sprinkle one little ounce of, oh my god.
[14:35.71]If you get anything with cinnamon on it, it's just a cinnamon thing.
[14:38.59]It doesn't taste like the thing you have.
[14:40.49]Alright, stop fucking complaining.
[14:41.89]Stop talking to me.
[14:47.32]I don't want to fight this fucking thing cause like it takes a million health will it burn?

[15:14.71]I appreciate what Cinnamon's going for, but I'm not really into it that much.
[15:17.87]Like, what are you talking about?
[15:18.89]Alright, get out of my way.
[15:21.61]I'm going to the building.
[15:22.23]Okay.
[15:27.32]You can go through walls.
[15:30.42]Fix your fucking broken game.
[15:32.94]It's been a problem for a decade.
[15:34.42]Fix it.
[15:35.36]People can shoot- hit through walls.
[15:37.14]Fix your broken game.
[15:38.04]Okay, so this was- where is this?
[15:47.30]What?
[15:47.44]What was that?
[15:54.06]It was- It was you?
[15:55.30]What the fuck?
[15:58.44]That was terrifying.
[15:59.46]Here comes the Capcom rant.
[16:04.41]No.
[16:05.45]Alright, so this is- There's a bonfire up here, right?
[16:16.33]Isn't there?
[16:19.01]Because that's a shortcut to... Isn't there a bonfire, like, right here?
[16:22.25]Please, God.
[16:30.35]What?
[16:31.27]You do not like cinnamon rolls?
[16:32.98]I just... It's too much for me.
[16:34.64]It's just, like, it's too much.
[16:42.84]Anytime I have cinnamon, I always have the same, like...
[16:46.67]reaction to it all right so this is where that was so okay if we go from here I just want to get this burn in my brain all right so from this bonfire we go up shortcut achieved you have children taste child taste wait go back down he has one taste bud
[17:17.52]Some of you, like, some of you Cinnamon Andes, seriously, are like... Really?
[17:22.36]Like, you don't care that much about cinnamon, right?
[17:26.76]Cool.
[17:34.39]Ooh.
[17:42.13]That's where it is!
[17:42.91]I've been hearing this for the last, like, three in-game hours.
[17:46.35]What is it?
[17:47.88]Ooh, a somber spilling spell.
[17:52.40]I can probably make that.
[17:53.08]Just run across, right?
[17:53.82]Alright.
[18:01.95]I have E1.
[18:04.87]I'm flabbergasted you're using cinnamon as a bit.
[18:14.35]Here we go.
[18:17.02]I don't like cinnamon, so this is like a comedy routine.
[18:24.57]Okay, wait a minute.
[18:26.73]If I had a microphone in my hand and there was a slight echo, I guess you... I guess that... Play that whole... Okay.
[18:32.51]Play that whole thing back.
[18:34.23]The entire thing that I said about, like, cinnamons and, like, red apple and stuff.
[18:39.10]Add a little bit of an echo and, like, a little bit of a mic effect and an audience laughing every, like, 10 to 15 seconds.
[18:47.31]It probably would be like a comedy routine.
[18:56.39]Oh, God.
[19:00.40]Still don't understand why the cinnamon challenge was even a thing.
[19:08.88]I don't know.
[19:09.42]Yeah, I forgot about that.
[19:10.14]People would just like take a bunch of cinnamon and go like...
[19:13.90]Like spit it out.
[19:14.86]I forgot about that.
[19:17.36]That was a thing for a long time.
[19:24.92]I don't want this guy's gonna kill me I'm sorry that I mentioned the candles.
[19:31.17]I was observing it too Please next joke
[19:45.42]You go to a stand-up routine and the whole like 10 minute open mic night is the guy just talking about like red cinnamon.
[19:53.91]Cinnamon, red cinnamon.
[19:54.59]Yeah, it's gross.
[19:55.23]Remember those cinnamon videos?
[19:56.33]People used to eat cinnamon.
[19:57.37]Yeah, cinnamon sucks, by the way.
[19:58.67]Alright, that's my time.

[20:55.14]Alright, if I'm from software, I'm putting...
[21:12.89]How come you don't take fire damage?

[21:46.29]Okay, I want you to do me a favor.
[21:57.71]Okay.
[22:05.70]Name me something that cinnamon is good on.
[22:10.18]That's not a pie or some kind of dessert.
[22:15.32]Where else can you use cinnamon besides the crust of a pie?
[22:21.51]Cinnamon Toast Crunch does not count.
[22:23.49]That's like cinnamon sugar bullshit.
[22:25.77]That's not real cinnamon.
[22:30.59]Yeah, that is like not even close to being real cinnamon.
[22:35.99]It's like sugar.
[22:39.50]Somebody in a flavor lab came up with that.
[22:41.78]That's not cinnamon.
[22:45.40]Applesauce?
[22:52.80]Applesauce.
[22:54.90]You drunk?
[22:56.61]You drunk?
[22:59.88]Okay.
[23:03.76]On eggnog.
[23:07.04]Alright, look, I gotta pay attention to the fucking game.
[23:10.03]This is where I wanna be.
[23:12.03]Yes, okay.
[23:13.15]I spent, like, two hours yesterday just talking and, like, walking in circles.
[23:17.19]I gotta, like, progress through Elderberry Ring.
[23:26.00]Probably should sit at the bonfire, though.
[23:36.81]I love cinnamon applesauce.
[23:49.56]I mean, I guess it's like okay.
[23:54.20]I would put it pretty low on like the kind of spices list.
[24:01.46]Alright, that one has it right.
[24:09.31]Why would I jump to it?
[24:12.17]What is Spice's tier list?
[24:15.63]I don't think one exists.
[24:16.53]Alright, let me check down here first.
[24:23.81]What about Apple Jacks?
[24:26.18]Apple Jacks is all this cinnamon... It's cinnamon sugar, fake cinnamon shit.
[24:31.98]It's not actual cinnamon.
[24:37.64]You know what they do?
[24:39.12]They put one little dash of cinnamon and then five tablespoons of sugar and they mix it up.
[24:50.01]I think I've been over here already.
[24:51.03]Let me go back up.
[24:53.21]Yeah, I was.
[24:58.61]You're moving goalposts.
[24:59.99]That's what I do here.
[25:07.69]Opium.
[25:07.99]Cinnamon sugar isn't actually cinnamon.
[25:14.26]Is whipped cream milk?
[25:17.50]Does that argument make any sense?
[25:18.62]I don't know, maybe.
[25:24.24]No, it's not.
[25:24.62]It's not milk.
[25:25.40]It has milk in it.
[25:27.09]It's made from milk, but it's not just milk.
[25:29.93]Cinnamon just cinnamon is gross.
[25:33.15]I win.
[25:33.35]There's one place that I would agree with you, and that is Taco Bell Cinnamon Twisties.
[25:47.97]That is the one spot I will agree with you.
[25:51.89]But again, not really cinnamon, is it?
[25:55.91]It's like 1% cinnamon.
[26:01.35]I've been down here, right?
[26:04.97]Where does that go?
[26:06.19]Okay, so this is that.
[26:09.86]This ladder goes... Wait a minute.
[26:12.20]I've not been here yet, have I?
[26:14.80]No, I haven't.
[26:15.44]Alright, hold on.
[26:15.90]Where does the elevator go?
[26:22.43]There's no ad for Taco Bell.
[26:23.71]Taco Bell is the best fast food place.
[26:28.98]Best.
[26:30.98]It does go over McDonald's for me.
[26:35.34]It is better than McDonald's.
[26:37.98]Because it has the single best menu item.
[26:41.04]Any restaurant in the world.
[26:42.70]And I'm not talking fast food.
[26:43.60]I mean restaurant.
[26:45.11]The best single restaurant item on earth.
[26:55.35]I would eat a cheesy gordita crunch over filet mignon.
[26:58.13]And be like, yeah, that was better.
[27:00.23]Just a single best menu item in the world.
[27:13.26]Kind of spitting facts.
[27:16.00]Well, thank you.
[27:19.20]I appreciate it.
[27:20.44]Is this an illusory wall?
[27:23.71]Dude, kind of spitting facts right now.
[27:27.75]Where is he going?
[27:28.71]I just got an elevator.
[27:29.81]I'm trying to see where it is.
[27:32.65]Wait, I already went in that elevator.
[27:34.05]I'm very distracted.
[27:35.85]Okay, I am... Alright, I'm extraordinarily distracted.
[27:47.03]Zero progress.
[27:48.09]It's been 30 fucking minutes.
[27:49.85]I know, but I just, like, whatever.
[27:53.03]I told you, I'm an Elden Ring streamer now.
[27:54.97]And that means I gotta drag the content up.
[28:02.01]Fuck, alright.
[28:02.73]I'm doing progress now.
[28:03.71]No more talking about anything that doesn't... Alright, hold on.
[28:09.20]I want to save all these Crunchies, but I'll use them.
[28:10.88]7,000.
[28:14.40]There we go.
[28:14.80]Nice double.
[28:17.90]I need to shave tonight, probably.
[28:20.92]Alright, I have 20 Endurance.
[28:23.59]I am at everywhere I want to be.
[28:26.29]Now the question is, do I keep leveling up vigor or do I put some more points in mind?
[28:32.09]Get mind to like 25.
[28:33.03]I'm going to say mind.
[28:40.95]Mind and then maybe go back to an int.
[28:45.85]I'll get mind to 25.
[28:48.19]I feel like I do really need mana.
[28:49.47]Alright, here we go.
[28:50.15]Time for progress.
[28:53.90]You should pretend you're Let's Playing.
[28:55.36]You know how many times I've made that joke?
[28:58.56]I've done the, like, I'm making a Let's Play... After the age of Twitch, right?
[29:04.85]I don't know if you guys remember, but people would do Let's Plays.
[29:09.75]They probably still do.
[29:11.75]Where the video would be 10 to 15 minutes long, and then there'd be, like, another video.
[29:17.71]Good luck making one of those kinds of YouTube playlists with this game.
[29:21.45]You're going to have like 800 videos.
[29:24.07]This is going to be something crazy.
[29:30.26]Get to the Vigor soft cap.
[29:31.84]It's 50.
[29:32.20]Yeah, after mine 25, I'll get there.
[29:36.96]All right, so here we go.
[29:37.58]Let's go.
[29:37.88]Here we go.
[29:38.18]This is the way I'm going.
[29:40.82]Game progress.
[29:41.70]I'm ready.
[29:42.96]We're going this way.
[29:43.94]We're going to progress.
[29:45.37]Not going down any weird ladders.
[29:51.23]Oh, but I looked up.
[29:53.41]I didn't look up any spoilers or anything.
[29:54.97]But I wanted to see the level kind of range for Mount Gelmer.
[30:00.01]And it's the thing that I just looked up.
[30:02.53]Level range Mount Gelmer.
[30:05.33]And it says 80 to 100.
[30:07.67]So, I think I'm alright.
[30:10.15]I'm right at the kind of top end of being leveled for this area.
[30:14.20]So, what is this place called?
[30:16.60]Is it not Gelmer?
[30:17.02]Gilmer?
[30:18.68]Gilmer?
[30:20.68]What's this place called?
[30:23.50]What is this place called?
[30:28.48]Mount Gilmore?
[30:31.62]Gelman?
[30:32.59]Mount Gilmore.
[30:33.59]It's Gelmir.
[30:34.27]That's what I said.
[30:34.97]I said Gelmir.
[30:39.05]What are you talking about?
[30:39.71]That's exactly what I just said.
[30:41.15]Gelmir.
[30:44.29]What is it?
[30:44.57]Is it like Gelmir?
[30:45.51]Gelmir?
[30:50.56]How many times do you swing us around in a circle, dude?
[30:53.58]Alright, fine.
[30:54.34]Fuck it.
[30:55.56]Crystal Barrage!
[31:06.05]That move is seriously so bad.
[31:07.31]I don't know why I have it in my loadout.
[31:15.01]It's Gelmir.
[31:19.17]It's not Gelmer?
[31:25.08]Oh, come to Gelmer.
[31:27.36]Mount... Mount Gelman.
[31:32.75]Ominous, hey!
[31:34.65]I heard somebody.
[31:37.29]Yes, I got it.
[31:41.61]Mount Gelmer Fudd.
[31:51.98]Chad is a filthy liar.
[31:53.26]Okay.
[31:54.62]It's Gelmir.
[31:58.74]It's not like Gelman.
[31:59.95]What are you talking about?
[32:06.03]No, I'm the dev.
[32:06.91]It's Gelmir.
[32:07.59]I'm the dev for this game.
[32:20.36]You know what?
[32:20.66]We're gonna cast.
[32:22.10]Stay with me at the same time here.
[32:24.92]Casting.
[32:25.80]Fucking.
[32:28.16]Come on.
[32:28.68]Say it.
[32:31.74]Highlight kid.
[32:32.32]There it is.
[32:32.78]Thank you.
[32:34.44]I couldn't fucking cast it unless somebody said it.
[32:37.68]That's in my chat.
[32:38.30]We got a fucking back and forth.
[32:39.42]Me and my chat.
[32:39.96]You know what I mean?
[32:40.38]I've been doing this for a little while.
[32:43.16]I've been playing fucking games on Twitch for a little while.
[32:45.90]We got a fun fucking back and forth.
[32:47.42]We got a fun thing here.
[33:11.93]Ugh, these guys are so poisoned.
[33:17.91]I gotta put on some different gear, I think.
[33:19.63]I'm taking a lot of damage.
[33:27.86]Man serpent?
[33:28.66]Oh, you can have a snake friend.
[33:30.32]That's actually cool.
[33:33.03]You have one of these?
[33:34.17]Oh my goodness, that's cool.
[33:35.45]What happened to taking a break today?
[33:48.36]Um... I don't know, I just kind of feel like playing.
[33:50.42]I feel like just hanging out.
[33:52.70]I really want to play.
[33:54.28]And the last week, so over the last week, I've had, like, kind of medical problems.
[34:01.08]I haven't really been playing that much.
[34:02.28]And I didn't want to play off-stream content that I haven't seen yet.
[34:06.21]So now that I'm, like, I can stream, I'm, like, good to go for a little bit, I think.
[34:12.45]I want to play.
[34:12.97]Like, I want to play Elden Ring.
[34:14.15]And I don't want to play off-stream unless I've already seen it.
[34:16.51]All right.
[34:18.17]Well, there's one of those things back here.
[34:26.68]I feel like I've not been paying attention to the amount of these keys that I still have.
[34:32.28]I've just been using them.
[34:34.08]Okay, I got a lot.
[34:34.68]I have 11.
[34:36.60]What's in here?
[34:41.62]Heads up, you're almost at the cutoff for the assassination missions.
[34:44.16]Thank you, backseater.
[34:45.50]I actually appreciate it.
[34:53.29]Fuckin'.
[35:10.60]How far down does this go?
[35:11.40]Somebody's casting a spell at me!
[35:21.69]Oh, fuck!
[35:22.31]Don't move, don't move.
[35:23.15]Go this way.
[35:42.97]Why did he have range and I didn't?
[35:44.31]How do you get over there?
[35:51.04]What?
[35:52.28]How do you get up there?
[36:00.08]Inaccurate?
[36:00.62]What?
[36:02.27]Is it a ledge?
[36:03.03]Is there a ledge?
[36:10.67]Skyline, yeah.
[36:16.95]You can't jump on that.
[36:17.79]You're talking about that right there?
[36:20.63]I don't think you can... No, you can't jump on that.
[36:26.41]Maybe there's an elevator that goes up.
[36:33.06]I almost just fucking fell off.
[36:43.36]Does it matter?
[36:43.82]Is it safe to fall down?
[36:44.87]Oh fuck.
[36:48.55]I probably messed that up a little bit.
[36:58.25]I don't know, who's your favorite waifu?
[37:00.46]Shake a load of Katarina.
[37:03.70]Alright, so this is down here.
[37:14.68]It's the wrong game.
[37:21.71]Is it though?
[37:29.01]Another one of these!
[37:31.31]Right?
[37:31.90]How many of these do I have?
[37:33.08]Don't I have one of these already?
[37:37.32]Where is it?
[37:44.08]Aha!
[37:44.74]I have two of these.
[37:46.76]I gotta feed these to the dung eater.
[37:47.88]Before I go up, I'm gonna go over here.
[37:59.56]I never want to hear you say waifu again.
[38:08.97]Why do I have to play by a certain set of rules though, right?
[38:11.51]Like, a bunch of you guys say that shit a lot.
[38:14.23]But I can't make a reference to it, right?
[38:16.67]Like, why do you get to play by a different set of rules than I do?
[38:19.61]I feel like that painting is alive.
[38:25.57]Royal Knight's Resolve.
[38:30.04]You're a grown adult.
[38:36.14]You guys make references to this shit.
[38:44.29]And to be very fair, my response was a very joke response, okay?
[38:48.83]Because you're 36. 36.
[39:06.02]Oh, hey!
[39:08.70]Wait, is this that door that's locked?
[39:10.05]This isn't the manor.
[39:15.77]What is Patches doing here?
[39:19.93]Well, you joined the manor, huh?
[39:22.30]I don't believe it.
[39:23.82]Didn't think you had it in you.
[39:25.64]All good, though.
[39:26.80]We're on the same side now.
[39:28.80]We'll do good work together.
[39:31.70]He's such a dick.
[39:42.32]Are you surprised that I belong to the Volcano Manor?
[39:46.04]I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable two fingers.
[39:51.24]I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade.
[39:54.54]Not to mention, Tanith has always made me curious.
[39:59.12]I guess her master must really be something, because she's pretty damn smug about it.
[40:04.54]Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.
[40:09.82]I've never seen a woman quite like her.
[40:14.21]Patches, you have a regular plus two short spear.
[40:19.87]I don't think you get to tell me what I'm doing here, okay?
[40:24.19]You see me?
[40:25.23]You see what I got?
[40:37.00]Grace mimic gold?
[40:38.08]Ooh, can I make that?
[40:39.36]Not that I really care, but I guess I'll own it.
[40:47.52]Mm-hmm.
[40:50.74]Alright, bye.
[40:52.47]Alright, so somebody said I was getting painfully close to not being able... I gotta do the assassin... I can't even... That word is hard to say.
[41:01.43]Say it a few times.
[41:02.37]Assassin.
[41:05.42]Somebody said I'm getting close to needing to do the assassin mission, so I'm gonna be kind of fucked, right?
[41:14.08]Say assassin 10 times.
[41:15.92]Assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin, assassin.
[41:31.35]That was way more than 10, yeah?
[41:34.67]You know who you're talking to?
[41:35.85]This is fucking Jerpa985 we're talking about here.
[41:42.82]Put the fucking ego on this guy.
[41:45.77]Alright, but there's another way to go.
[41:48.79]This is... Wait.
[41:54.73]Wait, what happened?
[41:55.87]Where am I?
[41:56.37]What?
[41:56.53]Did I go in the wrong door?
[42:00.85]What happened?
[42:02.67]What's happening?
[42:05.07]Wasn't there a... Wasn't there a... Wait, wasn't there a... Wasn't there a...
[42:16.69]I don't remember that thing.
[42:20.51]I'm really lost.
[42:21.17]Yeah, I don't remember that thing.
[42:22.93]That big mechanical thing wasn't there.
[42:24.68]It's a new area?
[42:29.00]But didn't I come from one of those key gargoyles?
[42:37.85]We fell down here.
[42:43.35]Bro, I don't fucking actually remember.
[42:45.73]Like, I remember putting the key into the stone thing, going in and falling down.
[42:49.76]There were two ways to go.
[42:51.88]You jump down the cages.
[42:59.34]Yeah, but wasn't there another way I could have gone?
[43:04.56]Oh my god, this- Okay, I'm gonna go that way.
[43:06.66]There's so many places to go.
[43:13.27]Phone, bro.
[43:13.93]I'm just saying it out loud.
[43:15.06]I'm exclaiming it.
[43:15.72]Alright, well then, let me... I guess I'm going this way?
[43:28.24]But somebody said, dude, you're painfully close to not being able to complete something.
[43:31.39]So, should I do that first?
[43:32.79]That looks to be very, very much a room that I'm going to be careful of.
[43:45.28]all right all right all right all right all right all right so I need to talk to somebody to get another assassination mission you've got brain rot nice bit rate what's wrong with a bit rate
[44:15.97]There should be another letter on the table.
[44:17.17]Okay.
[44:24.88]This dude's on drugs.
[44:27.20]Alright.
[44:27.82]I'm not on drugs.
[44:29.14]Alright, here we go.
[44:30.34]Another letter.
[44:30.76]Let's see.
[44:31.62]What is this one for?
[44:43.42]It's in a weird place, right?
[44:47.49]Yeah, it's in like this weird, okay.
[44:50.61]Old Knight Istva.
[44:51.57]No, I already killed him.
[44:53.45]It's like, I already did that.
[44:56.99]Riley the Idol.
[44:58.21]He can be found at Atlas Plateau.
[44:59.69]Okay.
[45:05.10]Down here.
[45:07.78]Bridge of Iniquity.
[45:15.02]He's idle right now.
[45:16.04]Is he actually just sitting around?
[45:25.07]So that, is it over here?
[45:28.49]Are you down in the, uh, like in this butt crack down here?
[45:30.77]Alright, he's down in the butt crack.
[45:36.28]How do I get down to the butt crack from here?
[45:38.36]I think I can make it.
[45:48.94]Think I can land on that?
[45:54.70]Oh, boy.
[45:55.16]I have to commit.
[45:55.72]I have to commit.
[45:56.22]I'm falling.
[45:56.62]I have to commit.
[45:57.06]Should I commit?
[45:58.74]I'm trying to jump.
[45:59.40]No, I can't.
[46:00.07]Commit the other way.
[46:00.75]We're good.
[46:08.57]I guess I could go from... I think I have to go from all the way down here.
[46:12.38]Right?
[46:14.42]Like this way.
[46:15.86]I'm assuming.
[46:28.48]I have to start, like, from the lift.
[46:33.47]No fall joke today?
[46:34.45]Oh, there's already been one.
[46:38.93]This just brings you right up, right?
[46:46.63]You're taking the literally longest wrong way.
[46:53.25]Look, I don't have... I don't have the goddamn fucking...
[46:56.87]Game Informer, uh, special edition Elden Ring guide on how to get there.
[47:03.86]I don't have the special edition Game Informer that's eight extra magazine pages that shows all the places to go.
[47:18.63]This is safe.
[47:25.09]How do I get down here?
[47:26.53]Sorry, I don't know.
[47:34.79]I don't have, like, the game informer.
[47:36.92]Oh, where do I go?
[47:38.00]Oh, let's see.
[47:38.62]Over here, I think.
[47:42.68]Alright, so what's a better one?
[47:43.94]What's a... I don't give a shit about losing those souls.
[47:59.63]Is there a way I can get from here to there?
[48:01.47]You said I took the longest way possible.
[48:03.12]Where's the closest bonfire then?
[48:05.98]Okay, where's the closest bonfire then if you're so smart?
[48:10.65]Oh, I found it.
[48:11.11]Okay.
[48:39.58]Hey, what?
[48:51.53]That was actually shocking.
[48:55.67]That was shocking.
[48:57.92]That was shocking.
[48:59.74]Why did I die from that?
[49:06.24]I've...
[49:07.88]I'm shocked.
[49:08.80]Look at the expression on my face.
[49:11.73]Look.
[49:17.05]You have to be pretending.
[49:18.03]Dude, I'm sorry.
[49:19.59]I do that five out of five times.
[49:22.89]And I land that every time.
[49:26.35]So, what was wrong with that?
[49:32.67]You're telling me that's too far?
[49:35.69]But this is too...
[49:40.17]That is no way that... That is no way.
[49:43.49]I refuse to believe it.
[49:45.91]Actually not possible.
[49:47.57]That that killed me.
[49:49.47]There must have been a bug in the fucking code somewhere.
[49:51.13]Three.
[50:04.85]That's it.
[50:05.13]I actually didn't even come down here before.
[50:12.81]There's no fall damage in the cyclones.
[50:14.39]All right, let's kill this motherfucker.
[50:20.93]This person, this is the idol.
[50:23.23]Invade Rylai, the idol's world.
[50:26.65]Yes.
[50:26.85]I thought all the old men were asleep now.
[50:48.59]I don't know why that took me like five extra seconds to figure out how to get that menu, like my inventory menu correct.
[51:49.45]What do you got?
[51:51.55]You're high as shit right now.
[51:52.79]I am not!
[51:53.65]You didn't drop anything?
[52:06.31]I thought I... Oh.
[52:08.67]Crepus vile.
[52:10.91]Black key bolt.
[52:11.59]What's a crepus vile?
[52:20.36]That's not a... Eliminates all sound made by the wearer during movement.
[52:25.36]Sorry.
[52:29.18]This has got to be a bonfire I can get.
[52:32.86]There's this area here that I have marked.
[52:38.33]There has to be a bonfire down here.
[52:47.26]Ooh.
[52:52.12]That's a weedleberry.
[52:56.59]A bonfire?
[52:57.17]There has to be.
[53:13.08]This place is cool.
[53:14.04]This place is fucking stupid.
[53:20.14]What do I, um... Is there a front entrance?
[53:41.53]Hello.
[53:43.37]Ah!
[53:44.89]A shaded castle.
[53:49.54]I don't want to do this part yet.
[53:51.78]I don't want to do this.
[53:54.38]This is like a whole ordeal.
[53:55.44]It's going to take like an hour or two.
[53:57.14]It's a whole ordeal.
[53:59.26]Let me go back to the manor and see if I... How many assassin... I can't say that fucking word.
[54:07.14]Assassin missions.
[54:08.38]It's because I'm adding the SH that I want to say on mission.
[54:14.21]Like a Shashin mission.
[54:22.06]This place might be easy for you at this level.
[54:25.60]Maybe I'll do it on another character, though.
[54:27.44]Maybe I'll do it on another character.
[54:28.42]Uh, this is the guest hall, so... Oh, Agil.
[54:41.97]Oh, Agil, Agil.
[54:49.85]I saw guest room and I thought that was the right bonfire.
[54:52.68]It's not.
[55:00.80]Oh, Agil.
[55:01.54]Oh, Agil.
[55:03.08]There's one more?
[55:08.35]Okay.
[55:12.90]Did good, right?
[55:14.31]I see you performed another task for us.
[55:17.15]Here is your usual reward.
[55:18.71]Damn.
[55:23.01]Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you of the true ruler of this manor.
[55:30.00]Oh, I'm here to kill him.
[55:31.63]Mm-hmm.
[55:51.95]has refused to scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.
[55:59.01]If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so, then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.
[56:10.35]We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Reikard, have sworn no rest until it ends.
[56:16.27]But I'm just gonna kill him.
[56:17.57]If you follow this heroic path,
[56:20.84]Am I gonna be able just to backstab him?
[56:22.58]What's up, dude?
[56:22.88]Yeah, that armor's pretty fucking cool.
[56:23.98]That's pretty sick armor.
[56:44.71]Fucking, I mean, like, that magic defense on it, though, pretty fucking low, right?
[56:48.23]That's what I heard.
[56:49.89]My tailor does kind of stuff like that, too, but magic is pretty low on it, right?
[56:54.91]I would, yeah, probably.
[56:55.82]Not that I'm gonna, you know, not that I'm, you know, worrying about it, just like I'm worrying for you.
[57:04.88]I'm looking, I'm trying to look out for you, man.
[57:07.90]Magic defense low on that, yeah?
[57:09.41]Pretty low?
[57:09.75]Alright, fucking, alright, kid.
[57:13.03]Alright, fucking see you later, dude.
[57:15.68]Hey, mama said hi.
[57:19.84]Not in like a weird... You know what I mean?
[57:21.48]That was supposed to be respectful.
[57:23.06]That was not supposed to be mean.
[57:25.32]That was supposed to be respectful.
[57:27.94]This one's red.
[57:38.43]Red.
[57:47.18]Something's wrong with me today.
[57:48.06]I swear to God.
[57:50.28]All right.
[57:53.66]Scooby-Doo.
[57:58.74]All right.
[57:59.15]Final request.
[57:59.89]The letter is vivid red.
[58:01.07]Juno Hoslo.
[58:03.93]Wait.
[58:05.43]Knight of Blood?
[58:06.33]He can be found in the mountaintops of the giants.
[58:11.07]Find the red mark on your map.
[58:15.21]Isn't that...
[58:18.80]You know this person?
[58:21.93]It's you, is it?
[58:23.13]I'm terribly sorry.
[58:24.63]But would you mind giving me some time to myself?
[58:27.21]I haven't achieved anything at all thus far.
[58:29.93]Even though I've dirtied my hands time and time again, I'm still yet to achieve anything.
[58:35.31]Perhaps I am a fool after all.
[58:37.65]No, it's worse than that.
[58:40.36]As things stand, I've given up on the path of revenge and sullied the name of my house.
[58:45.00]This is a plot twist.
[58:45.66]What an easy mark I must have been.
[58:47.98]How did it take me so long to realize, honestly, there's just no end to my foolishness, is there?
[58:57.93]What's up, dude?
[58:58.75]Yeah.
[58:59.75]No, you're not foolish, kid.
[59:00.63]You're fucking fine.
[59:04.24]How high is that defense on that for magic?
[59:06.24]Just fucking... Bobby was talking to me the other day about how his armor was fucking pretty low on magic defense.
[59:15.08]Yeah, he's a fucking loser.
[59:16.61]I don't talk to him anymore, but he told me that the kind of gear that you have... Is it?
[59:20.61]It's low?
[59:20.93]Alright, fuck.
[59:22.85]Alright, fuck.
[59:23.45]Alright, shut the fuck up.
[59:24.75]Alright.
[59:30.31]I'm so sorry.
[59:31.71]Everybody hates that.
[59:32.95]Everybody hates it, but I love it, and I'm never going to stop doing it.
[59:40.79]Everybody hates it.
[59:42.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:48.34]I can't do... That's really far away.
[59:54.62]Can I do this?
[59:57.14]Before... I thought... Did you guys lie to me?
[59:59.50]I thought you guys said that I was supposed to do this.
[60:02.68]Before I fought this guy.
[60:04.26]Talk to the hammer guy.
[60:14.67]Ooh.
[60:24.39]Letter to Bernal.
[60:25.41]Really?
[60:26.65]So I... I'm not... I'm kidding.
[60:55.25]Okay, so what about, um, what is this for?
[61:03.56]Written request from Volcano Manor addressed to Bernal, disclosing the names of two tarnished to be hunted.
[61:08.62]Bargrim the Raging Wolf and Errant Sorcerer Wilhelm.
[61:15.07]Both men can be found in the royal capital of Lendel.
[61:18.27]Find the red mark on your map.
[61:25.25]This is not an official request.
[61:30.31]Oh, right here.
[61:30.73]Should I do this?
[61:36.69]This is not an official request.
[61:39.47]Talk to Patches.
[61:52.28]Patches was, where was Patches?
[61:53.77]Was he over here?
[61:54.27]He was sitting outside, yeah.
[61:55.94]He was like leaning down.
[62:05.19]How many errands do I have to do?
[62:19.42]I don't trust.
[62:19.92]Okay.
[62:20.46]He's going to make me go somewhere and he's going to like jump on me like a fucking Goomba.
[62:26.69]Yeah.
[62:26.97]He's going to jump on me like a Goomba and just crush my like body and spine and shit.
[62:30.51]I don't.
[62:32.17]I don't trust anything this guy says.
[62:33.23]So where does he want me to go?
[62:34.09]Address to Patches.
[62:40.65]Wait, I'm doing all their shit for them.
[62:48.65]They got these letters and they're making me do this.
[62:54.61]Okay, well, let's just get this one out of the way.
[62:57.81]Frag off.
[63:01.32]Um...
[63:03.02]Where is he?
[63:03.54]Which one?
[63:03.84]I think it's that one, right?
[63:36.28]Okay.
[63:39.38]So where the hell are you?
[63:41.92]Right here, apparently.
[63:44.32]Invade Great Horned Tragoth.
[63:46.60]I feel like this guy's huge.
[63:47.92]Is this a giant?
[63:48.52]Okay.
[64:06.10]Oh, that was pretty sick.
[64:07.04]I'll give it to you.
[64:21.74]Oh, you piece of shit.
[64:22.58]You can't even dodge like that.
[64:23.80]How are you dodging like that with a hammer that big?
[64:40.88]Holy fuck, what just happened?
[64:59.43]Sorry, Chonist.
[65:04.01]That was from patches though, so there's something weird about that.
[65:10.34]Jerma, he had cats at home.
[65:11.66]I can't believe he did that.
[65:17.14]He had cats at home.
[65:23.18]That's... This is way too heavy, but it's cool looking.
[65:33.14]Oh, I got this.
[65:35.02]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[65:36.10]Not the finger maiden fillet.
[65:37.12]What is it?
[65:37.58]This one here.
[65:40.00]Why would I get this this late in the game?
[65:55.42]Old goat helm?
[65:58.90]Provides high poise.
[66:01.02]It does, doesn't it?
[66:03.29]Pretty cool.
[66:05.15]I got a... There was a new weapon, too, wasn't there?
[66:11.05]This thing.
[66:12.05]Dex C. Poison buildup.
[66:14.18]You know what?
[66:14.46]That's like one of the first poison weapons I think I've seen in the game.
[66:18.34]It's like three.
[66:20.62]Tana.
[66:22.54]Very cool.
[66:23.02]That's actually a really cool weapon.
[66:27.30]Oh, Mog.
[66:27.98]He's crying.
[66:29.38]I don't think Mog exists in the game.
[66:30.87]I feel like we made that up last night.
[66:34.58]Okay, so now let's go over here and get these two.
[66:40.22]I'm imagining it's probably here.
[66:56.81]Let's go to two.
[66:58.27]Okay, so where is it?
[67:02.01]Are they in this round table hold?
[67:06.90]I think they're probably just right here.
[67:11.10]Alright, let's go.
[67:11.48]I think I have to fight two people at the same time.
[67:14.87]Yeah, these people are co-oping.
[67:30.19]Wait.
[67:31.95]Oh, it's both of us.
[67:37.46]I'm annoying.
[67:37.92]I'm annoying.
[67:38.50]I'm annoying.
[67:39.14]Alright, I'll get this one.
[68:01.84]Doing good over here, man.
[68:03.78]He's getting his ass kicked.
[68:06.74]Hey!
[68:10.60]There's a chugging potion.
[68:24.50]Did you die?
[68:42.67]Nice job High five You're getting carried so hard I think I was doing alright You did not even contribute
[69:06.95]Raging Wolf Gauntlets and Greaves.
[69:20.69]One more by Vagrim the Raging Wolf, one of the first Tarnished to visit the Roundtable Hold.
[69:24.71]Cool.
[69:32.20]I've been wearing this.
[69:33.00]Let's see if we get anything better here.
[69:34.46]That's not going to put me over too heavy load.
[69:38.89]Raging Wolf armor.
[69:39.83]This is just still better.
[69:44.15]It's just still better.
[69:50.36]This scaled armor is insane.
[69:51.74]Where did I even get this?
[69:56.10]Oh, from Istvan.
[69:56.96]Okay.
[70:01.83]Okay.
[70:04.02]So, let's go back to the manor.
[70:06.72]Because I'm imagining that I just... That I completed it.
[70:09.16]So, let's go talk to them.
[70:11.58]Gale Dummer is really good.
[70:12.46]It is.
[70:12.64]Do you secrete noxious fumes?
[70:17.04]I think everybody does at some point.
[70:29.21]Oh.
[70:30.03]If you follow the... It cannot...
[70:38.56]Let's talk to the people over here.
[70:44.48]I did what you wanted.
[70:45.54]Now give me that cool weapon.
[70:47.20]It's just as my noble brother says.
[70:50.28]I'm a complete fool.
[70:52.58]I can't believe I thought I could become a champion.
[70:56.31]No.
[70:58.43]You've been here from the beginning of the game.
[71:00.75]I don't want you to... Perhaps I am a fool.
[71:02.69]No.
[71:03.41]It's worse than that.
[71:05.61]What an easy mark I was...
[71:08.34]I don't like that.
[71:09.26]All the NPCs that I like are starting to kind of go away.
[71:11.50]What is it?
[71:14.00]50-50?
[71:14.06]Gelman's Fury!
[71:14.42]Is that a sorcery?
[71:42.66]It is.
[71:43.56]It's Faith and Sorcery.
[71:46.35]Not happening.
[71:48.19]Cool, though.
[71:54.83]So, Faith and Sorcery.
[71:55.95]I always thought you had to pick one, but I guess when you get later in the game, you can kind of combine them.
[72:00.78]That's kind of cool.
[72:04.46]Alright, so let's talk to Patches.
[72:14.84]Who's that?
[72:15.32]What the fuck is this?
[72:22.64]Wait is this the girl?
[72:34.81]My true form.
[72:52.91]My real name is Zorias.
[72:56.20]Please forgive the deception.
[72:58.44]Do you understand?
[73:00.36]This duplicity is my own doing.
[73:03.22]Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods.
[73:06.88]And the volcano manor is just as it seems.
[73:10.48]Wait.
[73:13.76]Okay.
[73:14.24]Lady Tanith is my mother.
[73:16.78]Oh.
[73:16.94]I am told I was born by the grace.
[73:19.68]Lady Tanith is a serpent.
[73:21.85]Okay.
[73:22.07]Alright.
[73:22.51]Perhaps.
[73:23.11]Don't worry.
[73:57.73]My serpentine form and the name Zarias were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I. Now I share the secrets with you as well.
[74:10.02]Please keep them safe from anyone else.
[74:14.80]I would advise you we close the door.
[74:19.37]We want to keep a secret that you're a serpent.
[74:21.39]My serpentines were secrets.
[74:23.53]Now I share the secrets.
[74:24.45]Please keep them...
[74:26.50]Um, like, that's not a great way to hide.
[74:32.77]All it takes is for, you know, like, like, I don't even know his name.
[74:38.57]Dalios just needs to come out and get, like, a coffee from, like, the fucking lobby, and he's gonna see you.
[74:42.47]Alright, so, should I talk to the mom?
[74:44.31]I gotta talk to Patches, but... Oh, shit!
[74:53.39]Did you see her?
[74:54.91]The girl, Raya.
[74:57.61]With her true face.
[75:00.39]Well, if she confided in you the name Zorias, then perhaps it is not my place to speak.
[75:07.64]But as her adoptive mother, I ask of you, please be kind to her.
[75:16.48]Look after young Zorias.
[75:18.54]Her true visage belies the purity of her heart, honestly.
[75:24.77]She's a snake.
[75:27.01]Whatever.
[75:27.37]She's a snake lady.
[75:28.17]Whatever.
[75:28.51]Anything else to say?
[75:38.26]There's like all kinds of... There's like turtles that talk.
[75:48.53]There's like...
[75:54.56]The little apes that talk and stuff?
[75:58.06]Don't worry.
[75:58.48]You're good.
[75:58.84]You're good.
[75:59.16]Don't worry about it.
[76:02.35]I mean, you can, like, turn into, like, a dragon, can't you?
[76:05.21]In these games?
[76:06.95]Don't worry.
[76:07.49]What do you get to worry about?
[76:09.21]We're good.
[76:09.49]There's giant talking pots.
[76:11.95]Yeah.
[76:12.06]What an easy mark.
[76:23.32]Look, we all now think this.
[76:26.01]We're like, wow, this character is so... What a cool character.
[76:28.89]This character is dead in less than fucking 40 minutes.
[76:32.13]You know what I mean?
[76:32.91]Like, FromSoftware is going to just ruin it for us.
[76:37.96]Look after her.
[76:38.64]Look after her.
[76:40.24]She's going to be lying on the ground.
[76:47.18]If I have the opportunity, I swear as a knight of the Volcano Manor that I will protect her at all costs.
[76:59.49]You're running between rooms.
[77:00.71]I'm taking in the lore!
[77:02.91]Relax!
[77:03.47]Let's go talk to Patches.
[77:05.41]Sorry I yelled at you.
[77:10.34]But you deserved it.
[77:16.89]Alright, so something weird is going on here.
[77:19.14]Okay, so... Sure, now I'm gonna rest.
[77:22.52]He's not gonna be here.
[77:24.86]You're a dick.
[77:25.44]I'm what?
[77:26.78]I'm not a dick.
[77:27.58]They made fun of me for walking in a circle.
[77:52.23]Anybody else I can talk to or is that it?
[78:00.34]Dial it back.
[78:01.08]He's gonna get feral.
[78:04.34]Okay, so where's Patches?
[78:05.34]I got some rest.
[78:15.61]What's the reward?
[78:16.23]Give me a rune fragment.
[78:18.97]Really?
[78:20.11]Wait, that thing is probably crazy.
[78:47.38]It's Dex Faith.
[78:49.54]Magma Whip.
[78:54.19]What?
[78:54.69]Is it a whip?
[78:55.55]It's a whip.
[78:57.63]What?
[79:01.56]That's so awesome.
[79:03.00]I need to, like, swing it.
[79:04.92]Really?
[79:05.18]Really?
[79:15.62]It's a sticky hand from those 25 cent machines.
[79:26.22]That's definitely way cooler if I had the specs to use it.
[79:28.58]I mean, that's awesome.
[79:34.10]That's probably the coolest faith weapon I've seen in the game so far.
[79:42.36]Alright, well that was fun.
[79:45.35]Thanks, Patches.
[79:51.36]So, is that it?
[79:53.06]Or is there more?
[79:57.28]Somebody said, what, do I lose access to doing these?
[79:59.78]Because I don't think I'm comfortable going to that other zone.
[80:06.27]Oh, shit.
[80:06.69]He's gone.
[80:07.79]He's gone.
[80:20.57]Oh, hello.
[80:24.51]Oh, it's you.
[80:26.81]Forgive me.
[80:28.52]My mind never ceases to turn of late.
[80:32.80]I know I can trust you.
[80:34.16]I saw something.
[80:35.02]Slithering.
[80:36.20]Slithering in the pitch black of night.
[80:39.96]It entered the room next to this one and never came out.
[80:45.20]Who's the snake?
[80:46.08]Who's the snake?
[80:47.02]Oh, I already saw it!
[81:12.02]Oh, you're good.
[81:12.56]You're good.
[81:13.12]You're good.
[81:13.76]Oh.
[81:14.52]Serpents?
[81:14.74]Oh, yeah.
[81:15.22]I picked that up.
[81:16.82]Needs a gamer chair.
[81:18.16]Hmm.
[81:41.89]That's the thing I got from the... I remember this scent distinctly.
[81:47.66]Hmm.
[81:49.26]Funny, isn't it?
[81:52.84]I am certain of it.
[81:54.00]Born inside of this?
[81:55.46]I was born inside this.
[81:59.03]It's a part of my birth, Mother.
[82:02.69]You have my gratitude.
[82:03.85]Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid.
[82:08.39]I want to know how I was born and met Lady Tanith.
[82:15.47]One day, I hope to call her mother once again.
[82:20.87]This time from the bottom of my heart.
[82:24.91]That's really inaccurate.
[82:26.95]Do I tell her?
[82:28.77]This dork comes and brings us in a little cradle.
[82:32.25]I feel like I should tell her.
[82:36.59]I want to know how I was born and met Lady Tanith.
[82:43.68]One day, I hope to call her mother.
[82:47.02]Okay, so should we go talk to...
[82:49.96]There's some family drama brewing here.
[82:53.46]Let's go find out.
[82:58.30]If you follow this, it cannot come.
[83:02.88]She said that to you.
[83:05.96]I should have known something was wrong.
[83:08.76]The signs were clear enough.
[83:10.90]Now, Zarias has placed her trust in you.
[83:15.39]All the more reason I must tell you that some things are better left unknown.
[83:21.85]Besides, no one should be blamed for their... Why are there monsters in the walls?
[83:28.21]We are resisting the ways of the Erdtree itself.
[83:31.90]What matters one's lineage in such a crisis?
[83:35.12]Dude, your drywall was trying to kill me earlier.
[83:37.22]So, like, I wanted you to explain that shit.
[83:39.06]Darius has placed her trust in you.
[83:42.12]That some things are better left unknown.
[83:46.21]Okay.
[83:47.83]Eye on you.
[84:01.29]You don't go fucking near her, by the way.
[84:07.96]Fucker.
[84:21.75]Where'd she go?
[84:22.05]Oh.
[84:22.11]I thought that was her lying on the ground.
[84:30.96]Alright, it's time to... It's time to watch the credits and open up the next episode.
[84:37.98]Right now, the timer on Netflix just went 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[84:45.11]Here we go.
[84:45.55]Here's the next episode.
[84:46.49]What happens?
[84:52.60]Wait, I don't know that yet.
[84:53.62]Hold on.
[84:54.15]I don't know that part.
[84:56.53]No, go back.
[84:57.13]You skipped the intro too far.
[84:59.41]You skipped the intro too far.
[85:04.98]She's gone.
[85:11.06]Where'd she go?
[85:22.24]Okay.
[85:22.60]Where?
[85:22.86]Why?
[85:23.00]Yeah.
[85:43.98]May I ask you, not as the manor's proprietress, but as Zorias' mother, if she discovers the answer to her question and it causes distress, have her drink this potion to purge that which would cause her pain.
[85:59.74]I don't want to give her a fucking potion.
[86:01.64]Tonic of Forgetfulness?
[86:03.34]Yes.
[86:04.38]My wish is a grave disrespect to her.
[86:07.80]No different than the Erdtree's imposition.
[86:10.42]But I have no choice.
[86:12.89]It must be done.
[86:15.56]my wish is a great I've noticed okay so hold on a minute you're telling me that I'm supposed to give her this drink that is going to make her like do what forgetfulness let me see what that says oh where is it tonic in a small brass file banish banishes distress and bitter memories
[86:40.87]Alright, make sure I don't, like, fucking mix these up.
[87:06.37]I also have, like, a bunch of perfume, like, potion bottles.
[87:10.15]I need, like, a little bit of a management system here.
[87:13.22]Just chug both.
[87:17.66]There's only one of these.
[87:18.52]Okay.
[87:21.44]So, I need to find where she went.
[87:25.65]Which is not very much info.
[87:28.55]I'm imagining it's probably somewhere here.
[87:33.72]It's got to be somewhere in the manor, right?
[87:35.84]There's no info on where she would be.
[87:40.10]Is there like a clue left in the room or something?
[87:41.70]Do you want directions or do you want to find it yourself?
[87:47.34]I'm going to imagine it's probably in the walls.
[87:52.19]Either that or it's further in the zone that I haven't been yet.
[87:57.79]Tell me if I'm on the right spot.
[87:59.29]Am I on the right path?
[88:04.45]Going in, like she's in here somewhere in the secret wall?
[88:11.34]No.
[88:13.56]Very cold.
[88:14.58]Okay.
[88:18.30]Somewhere in the dungeon overall.
[88:19.58]Okay.
[88:20.14]Alright.
[88:25.09]We'll beep as you get closer.
[88:26.79]She's in the lava area.
[88:30.99]You guys are gonna start beeping.
[88:34.16]Alright, now my question to you all is this.
[88:38.93]It was the concern that I know you gotta do this first.
[88:43.50]Because you might lose access to it after doing the boss here.
[88:46.48]Am I safe to do the boss now?
[88:49.60]Is that okay?
[88:51.33]Am I safe to continue to progress?
[89:02.13]Gotta go... I have to finish the assassin missions.
[89:05.93]But dude, I've... I haven't even been up here before.
[89:11.27]That's like far away.
[89:18.20]You can do the boss.
[89:19.40]You can come back to the boss later.
[89:21.58]Just do the boss.
[89:22.18]It's fine.
[89:22.64]Especially for... No kidding.
[89:24.12]Do the boss after the snake girl.
[89:26.47]You don't need the assassination missions.
[89:30.54]Okay, so let me try to find her.
[89:32.38]I'm very intrigued.
[89:35.05]So, people were talking about how she's in the lava area.
[89:38.69]I'll try to find it.
[89:44.99]You must defeat the Ashashins, Master Bruce.
[89:51.17]Yeah, you must defeat the Ashashins, Master Bruce.
[89:54.56]I can't even do it, man.
[90:00.81]Okay, lava area.
[90:03.69]You must defeat the assassin, you bastard.
[90:06.61]I feel like I'm just doing like, I don't.
[90:12.57]Alright, where is she in the town?
[90:14.83]Down by the lava.
[90:15.89]People were saying lava.
[90:20.62]Lava area.
[90:23.50]Do I die from this?
[90:25.98]No.
[90:27.46]Did I just find her?
[90:28.16]Is she like right here?
[90:30.47]She's, like, right there?
[90:31.33]She's right here, right?
[90:49.72]That was her.
[90:50.38]Alright, I have not explored over there, so I'm gonna guess that it's that way.
[90:59.60]This is like a lava area I haven't been to.
[91:01.48]There's a bunch of shit over here too.
[91:04.45]All right, wait a minute.
[91:14.09]You see, when someone is stabbed in the back, they don't make a sound like, it's for air coming out, gasping for air.
[91:42.71]Oh, it's... This thing's alive.
[91:48.45]What were you doing?
[91:49.09]I'm probably gonna... I'm gonna pick an item up and it's gonna... It's gonna activate.
[91:59.16]Did I just... I didn't kill anybody.
[92:01.46]Wait, I thought that... It's not you?
[92:03.80]It's not... Is it you?
[92:07.53]Is it you, man?
[92:08.71]Is it you in there?
[92:09.75]Why can't I attack?
[92:10.35]Why can't I... I don't want to kill your, like, child.
[92:13.05]Can I not talk?
[92:23.62]It's self-defense, and you know it was.
[92:27.10]Why... Is this... Is this Alex?
[92:29.76]Is this Alexander?
[92:31.14]It's Mouldering Shield.
[92:36.84]Can I get on the horse here or no?
[93:06.18]I just think I lost a few points with you guys, but... If I can attack, that means I'm gonna end up walking across the, like, trigger point for them all to attack me.
[93:26.08]It's gonna be an item that I touch or a thing that I do and they're all gonna stand up.
[93:30.44]That's how it works in every single Bomb Software game, okay?
[93:36.48]Don't give me shit.
[93:42.79]This one's gold.
[93:47.61]Oh, that's why.
[93:48.15]Is there anything else here?
[94:08.93]this everything's strong sticks all right I won't kill these three what's that this is like suspiciously you know this is a suspicious thing oh god damn it I can go that way um let's go that way uh yeah okay we'll go over here first
[94:40.57]A loathsome dung eater.
[94:45.43]Arise.
[94:46.91]Be tarnished.
[94:51.90]Can't get up there.
[94:59.94]Well.
[95:02.22]He dead.
[95:03.08]He yet live.
[95:04.25]Who yet live?
[95:04.93]I've ruined it.
[95:24.20]Well, that was kind of cool.
[95:25.36]I wonder if there's something else I can do there, but that's going to have to be on the me strong playthrough.
[95:37.14]I hope I can make this jump.
[95:43.89]I don't think I can.
[95:45.07]Can I make... I don't think I can make this.
[95:49.53]No, no way.
[95:51.95]Not a chance in hell.
[95:53.25]There might be a way to get up there from... Okay.
[95:54.93]I'm gonna go for it, though.
[95:55.83]Fuck it.
[95:56.96]I didn't even press the fuck jump button.
[95:58.80]God damn it.
[96:06.04]Ah, I've been here already.
[96:43.93]Hey.
[96:44.41]Over here.
[96:52.47]Okay.
[96:59.87]Okay.
[97:07.40]What is that?
[97:14.35]They're all kind of congregating around that.
[97:20.87]This place sucks.
[97:22.13]I think it's alright.
[97:29.98]I think I'm just going to... I want to know why they're over here.
[97:32.48]I'm curious.
[97:45.48]Is there an item that I already picked up over here?
[97:51.58]All right, can I get some beeps please?
[97:53.36]Am I close?
[97:57.44]What's the hot and cold meter look like?
[98:08.26]freezing cold beep beep ice cold ice cold ice cold is it really ice cold I've never found her again all right it's really apparently I'm ice cold right now
[98:33.15]Shit.
[98:33.55]Alright, so... Let me go up this way.
[98:37.65]This is ice cold.
[98:40.54]Alright, it's climbing this ladder and walking over here.
[98:53.09]What's the temperature like this way?
[98:54.21]Alright, if I were to walk through this door and straight through here, what's the temperature like?
[99:04.59]warm warmer warm it's cold but it's warmer okay all right so all right
[99:36.37]Okay.
[99:40.45]Alright, so if I... Is this cold?
[99:57.14]That's cold.
[99:58.57]Is this cold?
[99:59.67]Is this one cold?
[100:06.77]This one's hot.
[100:13.43]This is going to take an hour for you to find her.
[100:15.49]No, it's not.
[100:16.89]I'm going to give up in 10 minutes.
[100:17.99]I'm just going to ask you guys to tell me where it is.
[100:21.62]I'm going to ask for the exact location.
[100:31.34]I'll be like, just tell me where she is.
[100:38.44]Cold, cold, cold, cold.
[100:42.97]What the fuck?
[100:49.17]Am I getting warmer?
[101:01.18]I am.
[101:06.52]This way?
[101:12.83]Really?
[101:13.25]Fuck.
[101:13.61]Over here!
[101:14.45]Oh, I found her!
[101:16.11]Is it actually?
[101:19.65]Is it?
[101:20.73]Whoa, is it down here?
[101:43.05]Alright, just tell me where the fuck she is.
[101:44.03]I don't care.
[101:44.53]It's probably over here.
[101:47.69]What do you mean back down?
[101:48.93]I'm not going to go back down.
[101:51.39]You just told me to go up.
[101:52.27]I want it down, bro.
[101:57.97]Drop down.
[101:58.87]Take the elevator.
[102:02.41]Dude, I'm on top of the snake statue right now.
[102:04.43]Why can't there be no item here?
[102:15.07]Alright, so... You're like a cactus.
[102:22.35]Take the elevator again.
[102:29.68]Wait, I can jump off?
[102:33.22]The right of the elevator.
[102:40.36]This is the wrong elevator.
[102:42.52]Other elevator.
[102:43.70]Other elevator!
[102:46.89]There's two?
[102:50.06]Where's the other elevator?
[102:56.84]There ain't no second elevator right here.
[102:58.78]It's the one outside.
[103:04.23]Wait.
[103:04.63]Hey.
[103:07.09]I walked out here and everybody screamed and said I was going the wrong way.
[103:16.85]The next room?
[103:19.86]Wait, what are you talking about?
[103:21.42]Face the grace and go left.
[103:30.60]Oh, dude!
[103:32.03]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[103:34.27]Alright, alright, alright.
[103:35.29]Relax, relax.
[103:37.99]I thought you were lying to me.
[103:39.45]I thought you were lying to me.
[103:40.83]They're lying about somewhere to go.
[103:43.17]I thought you were lying to me.
[103:46.53]Hey, you cried wolf.
[104:02.09]God damn it.
[104:02.69]Okay, it's right there.
[104:15.68]Ah!
[104:59.54]I'm fucking kidding, guys.
[105:00.70]Give me a break.
[105:08.42]Oh.
[105:10.54]It's you.
[105:12.30]I'm afraid there is something... How could you ever miss that?
[105:16.72]I was an unwanted child.
[105:20.68]Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual.
[105:27.01]Something that can never be accepted.
[105:30.86]Not by men.
[105:33.48]Nor serpents.
[105:35.46]Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me.
[105:38.86]I know that you have done so much for me.
[105:42.12]But I wish to ask one last kindness.
[105:46.36]Kill me.
[105:47.99]Please.
[105:49.31]I thought that I feared nothing.
[105:52.61]But this... Free me from this accursed frame.
[106:00.19]Oh shit, no.
[106:06.98]I'm not doing it.
[106:10.40]No.
[106:11.30]No.
[106:12.16]No, I'm not going to do it.
[106:20.17]You and me, I made you a promise.
[106:22.39]I said that I would defend you and I would try to help you and take care of you.
[106:27.39]It goes against my code of not killing anyone that I have come into contact with that I say that I'm going to protect.
[106:33.67]I have a code.
[106:34.83]It's the German 985 code.
[106:36.85]It's my German 985 character code.
[106:41.00]If I'm in a game and I say I'm going to protect somebody, I will protect them.
[106:47.12]I'm kidding.
[106:48.34]Holy fuck, I almost actually hit her.
[106:49.88]Alright.
[106:53.31]Now come back here.
[106:58.46]Reload and come back.
[106:59.18]Yeah.
[107:19.69]Save and quit.
[107:20.47]Oh.
[107:22.07]Come back after the boss.
[107:30.57]Potion saves.
[107:31.89]But at what cost?
[107:33.03]Wait.
[107:38.32]He's gonna jump into the lava.
[107:40.14]Don't.
[107:42.42]Come back after the boss.
[107:50.59]Potion makes her forget.
[107:55.91]Potion is rude.
[108:00.11]You gleefully would kill the pot guy and his kids.
[108:03.81]I never swore an oath to protect pots.
[108:08.09]If I did, I wouldn't have done that.
[108:11.43]I would not have done that.
[108:15.26]I was standing in the room and I said, I am going to protect and help you.
[108:20.78]Whatever it takes.
[108:23.66]Alright.
[108:29.11]I'm going for it.
[108:29.69]Do I have enough runes to level up one more time?
[108:34.55]I think I do.
[108:35.71]Let's use this hero's rune.
[108:44.01]The assassinations.
[108:45.07]I really don't want to go all the way over there yet.
[108:49.01]That's like across the whole world.
[108:50.11]That's like the next zone.
[108:53.45]You have to or it's going to go away.
[109:02.03]Yeah, I'm me strong.
[109:04.43]I'll take care of it.
[109:16.87]They're not vital.
[109:18.25]Yeah, I'll be strong on land.
[109:21.33]Just for items.
[109:21.91]Yeah, it's alright.
[109:22.43]Alright, I wanna fu- I don't have enough.
[109:24.85]Let me just kill a few things.
[109:30.57]They don't go away.
[109:31.91]Yeah, it should be fine.
[109:33.44]Uh, let me just get- I gotta kill a few things.
[109:34.84]I need some souls.
[109:35.74]Because I wanna level up one more time.
[109:37.24]I thought I had it.
[109:50.98]Was it 60,000?
[109:51.24]60-something?
[109:53.84]67,000!
[109:53.86]That's way more than I thought it was gonna be.
[109:55.96]It's alright.
[110:03.74]And I gotta remember the bonfire that it was to go... Because there was like a big open door.
[110:07.48]Probably gonna be the boss.
[110:09.42]Remember, you promised that you were gonna show auto on stream.
[110:14.28]It's alright.
[110:14.78]Me strong will take care of it.
[110:15.70]Yeah.
[110:19.17]All of my duties, all the things I say are just going to go on to me strong.
[110:27.92]I have to start killing these things.
[110:35.56]Why are you procrastinating in Elden Ring?
[110:37.67]I feel like that's a huge part of the game, is to kind of wander around and come back and do stuff way later.
[110:47.75]Alright, I need to... I need to kill a few things.
[110:52.57]Where can I go to just kill a bunch of random shit?
[110:55.83]I'm gonna go to where that boss is, um... Where I was, right?
[111:02.61]From the church.
[111:03.71]From the church, right?
[111:05.51]What's the bonfire to get to where I was looking?
[111:06.87]I was like, oh, look at that big open door.
[111:08.17]I think it's here.
[111:18.04]The more you rush, the less Elden Ring content we're going to get.
[111:23.90]Oh, that's literally where I was just fucking standing, Jeremy.
[111:28.06]I was just standing there.
[111:33.11]I was standing there.
[111:37.93]I need some fucking goddamn vitamins today.
[111:40.17]All right.
[111:51.54]This is, this is, this is quick.
[111:55.28]Yes, it is.
[111:55.88]Alright, so now I want to go over here.
[111:57.90]And I want to go, not that way.
[112:00.40]I want to go the other way.
[112:03.86]There's a place that I wanted to go, and I don't remember where the fuck it is.
[112:08.58]It's up?
[112:09.50]Up there?
[112:10.20]I don't know, dude.
[112:11.02]I have no idea.
[112:12.30]Okay.
[112:20.13]Did you find the illusory toilet?
[112:23.35]Is that where you sit down to take a shit and when you shit, you actually like squeeze out your shit, the toilet goes away and you shit on the floor?
[112:31.82]What would that mean?
[112:35.72]That's so sad.
[112:39.74]Alright, I need to really fucking figure out where I'm going here.
[112:44.17]This area is just... My brain is having so much trouble with this zone.
[112:48.91]Because it's like the...
[112:55.61]Yes, somebody did say that.
[112:56.87]Yes, they did.
[112:57.47]I read that.
[112:59.23]I read it.
[112:59.85]Somebody said it.
[113:03.13]Give me a hand here, because I've honestly, like, we've been talking about, like, illusory toilets.
[113:07.36]Where am I going?
[113:09.80]I remember I looked at it, and I was like, I need to go that way, and I just kind of forgot where I was going.
[113:14.98]Where was it?
[113:15.28]It was, like, up there, I think.
[113:24.10]Was it the temple?
[113:28.61]Yeah, because I had to be, like, up higher.
[113:30.21]I didn't know how... There's so much verticality in this game.
[113:32.67]My brain is like... The map doesn't show, like, verticality, so it's just like... Is that one higher?
[113:37.78]Are we up?
[113:38.40]Are we down?
[113:38.84]And then it's from here out.
[113:41.26]Yeah.
[113:46.72]And then it's to the left of here, right?
[113:52.51]No.
[113:53.03]It's up and then off the balcony.
[113:54.33]There's so much fucking verticality.
[113:56.27]There's, like, 2,000 feet up and down.
[114:02.39]Like, from each of these four bonfires, it's like 4,000 feet up and down below and above sea level.
[114:13.06]Because then it's this way, which leads to up here.
[114:18.78]And then... I want to go up from here, right?
[114:21.94]Because the manor is behind me.
[114:29.04]I think this is correct.
[114:31.62]This place is fucking 10,000 feet below and above sea level.
[114:35.82]Like, it's huge.
[114:37.02]It's a goddamn mountain, okay?
[114:38.29]It's a mountain.
[114:39.01]And then... Oh, fucking goddammit.
[114:51.17]I have no idea where I'm going.
[114:57.45]Should I go at the shortcut elevator?
[115:01.45]What's he trying to do?
[115:02.17]I actually don't know.
[115:04.26]I'm trying to go to that area where I could... I looked over and I'm just going to go watch the VOD and go see where the fuck I was.
[115:15.43]I can't put it into long-term memory.
[115:17.33]There's so many levels to this mountain.
[115:20.03]Are we going the right way?
[115:28.22]Can I really not go to the map because these fucking slugs are in front of me?
[115:30.98]I should follow the slug path.
[115:41.89]I- Alright, let me- let me- let me play out a scenario.
[115:44.79]This is fucking confusing.
[115:46.13]Alright, so let me play a scenario out.
[115:47.91]Go to the elevator that is next to the- or not the elevator where the boss was, that second elevator, and then go from there, right?
[116:04.11]I think that's right.
[116:06.71]You had too many Flintstone gummies?
[116:08.07]Okay, yeah.
[116:11.51]So it's like out here.
[116:12.70]And then in this elevator.
[116:18.74]And then out that way.
[116:22.30]And go all the way up.
[116:24.45]I'm painting it in my head right now.
[116:33.77]OK, then we go this way.
[116:36.53]Nice try.
[116:37.17]And then.
[116:46.86]Out here.
[116:47.34]I think.
[116:52.68]Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[116:57.36]And then.
[117:01.02]Over here.
[117:05.14]and then okay all right but this is where I want this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yep and up yeah it's so hard to find this stuff
[117:30.75]They came back like an hour and a half later and I was still in this room.
[117:34.17]I did a bunch of side quests.
[117:35.83]I did a bunch of side missions.
[117:40.63]I did like the whole serpent girl quest line.
[117:44.08]I did the assassination mission.
[117:45.76]I've been doing things.
[117:47.14]I've been keeping myself busy.
[117:56.46]Yeah.
[117:57.11]Because then I went down here.
[118:00.68]And I remember specifically being like, how the fuck do I get back here?
[118:06.00]Me strong is going to handle that one.
[118:07.90]Me strong is going to handle that one.
[118:11.24]Yep.
[118:11.96]It was so long ago that I didn't put this into long-term memory.
[118:20.61]It's so funny that I keep saying me strong is going to handle this.
[118:23.65]But I don't think me strong is going to be able to get out of Limgrave.
[118:31.86]Mii Strong is going to walk off a cliff in Limgrave like 50 times and I'm going to have to turn the stream off.
[118:36.01]Did I get your stuff?
[118:51.52]Will the Mii Strong jokes last as long as the 50 hours it's going to take for this character?
[118:55.44]I am not going to play through the entire game as that character.
[119:03.39]Don't worry.
[119:04.51]That will be maybe one afternoon stream.
[119:09.58]Where I'd be lucky to be able to even beat the tree sentinel.
[119:15.88]Alright, so this is... Where is this going to take me?
[119:20.29]Find out.
[119:20.75]I have no idea.
[119:21.57]Whatever.
[119:35.42]not ready this is it I'm not ready for this I have 48 000 souls I need to hold on I'm not ready for this this is the audience pathway all right hold on I need to I need to get a few kills don't call me a coward I actually I need to just kill some stuff
[120:08.47]More stalling.
[120:09.67]No, I have 40, I have 50,000 souls.
[120:12.75]I don't want to lose them.
[120:15.40]I have to just get to 60 something thousand.
[120:18.48]It's not going to take that long.
[120:19.42]I promise.
[120:26.58]I just need like 15,000.
[120:27.62]Each one of this is okay.
[120:29.12]I have to kill like 10 things.
[120:31.82]Look, I'm just going to aggro the whole fucking dungeon.
[120:34.00]I'm going to do what I used to do on my Warlock in WoW.
[120:37.47]And that's aggro the entire dungeon when I was 20, 30 levels higher than it, whatever.
[120:44.07]And then do Seed of Corruption and kill 55 million things in one second.
[120:50.31]Ah.
[121:30.48]52, we're fine.
[121:34.82]Oh!
[121:35.22]Wait, I can go down here.
[121:35.96]This is where I get that item.
[121:47.90]Shit, I don't want to be down here.
[121:56.89]all right just I'll do that again you seem like the type of dude I don't know what the follow-up to that is but I I can assure you you don't know me
[122:24.02]Don't know me.
[122:36.03]Come on.
[122:37.75]Alright, that's what I'm talking about.
[122:40.63]Hey there.
[122:42.09]Why?
[122:42.41]Shut up.
[122:42.99]Why am I like killing dead air?
[122:44.33]That was awful.
[122:52.84]Hey there.
[122:53.66]Like, what the fuck, man?
[122:54.42]That was so stupid.
[122:54.98]Alright, that was worth 3,000.
[123:09.81]Almost there, I promise.
[123:11.79]Almost there.
[123:17.77]Because I'm almost guaranteed to lose these.
[123:21.47]I don't want to lose them.
[123:35.44]I actually want another one of those.
[123:36.37]Alright, we'll kill that guy again.
[123:38.15]Oh, fuck this.
[124:12.73]That guy's hard.
[124:57.33]Alright, we're good.
[125:11.22]Hit em all!
[125:11.62]Alright, 61,000.
[125:17.70]Almost there.
[125:23.18]That was a scripted loss?
[125:31.15]Alright.
[125:31.73]Everybody, round them up.
[125:38.24]There we go.
[125:38.88]62.
[125:38.94]Only a few thousand more and we're done.
[125:40.08]I already explored down here.
[125:55.40]What?
[125:55.58]You don't see- you never seen a streamer grind for souls on stream before?
[125:59.23]For a- I- I'm sorry.
[126:00.93]For 10 minutes?
[126:11.50]Mm-hmm.
[126:15.63]Where is it?
[126:15.97]It's one of those- there it is.
[126:25.80]Get the fuck away from me.
[126:41.29]Don't fuck with me.
[126:43.97]Alright.
[126:45.79]We did it.
[126:46.27]We got it.
[126:47.49]It's over.
[126:51.14]I completed it.
[126:51.70]67.
[126:54.06]Need to kill one more thing.
[127:02.92]Ooh.
[127:06.06]That's enough.
[127:06.74]67 for... 67.
[127:08.94]Alright.
[127:10.00]Let's go.
[127:11.20]I'm ready.
[127:15.80]Audience pathway.
[127:17.48]Fight the boss.
[127:21.99]What happened to the boys?
[127:22.95]I've been summoning them.
[127:25.11]I summoned the boys at the last boss I fought.
[127:27.05]Like, last night.
[127:34.35]I'm getting mine to 25.
[127:35.29]And then we're gonna dump pretty much everything else into vigor and intelligence.
[127:41.45]Alright, let's go.
[127:42.73]It's time.
[127:48.07]What is this?
[127:59.40]Serpent hunter.
[128:01.44]Is this a... Alright.
[128:02.90]Is this a gimmick fight?
[128:10.37]Where is it?
[128:13.69]Serpent Hunter.
[128:14.49]A weapon that serves as both greatsword and spear.
[128:21.53]Thought to have been used to hunt an immortal great serpent in the distant past, it manifests a long blade of light when facing such a creature.
[128:30.06]Okay.
[128:33.04]When their master's heroic aspirations degenerate into mere greed, his men search for a weapon with which they might halt their lord.
[128:40.25]Great Serpent Hunt.
[128:42.07]Perform a powerful forward lunge and follow up with an upward thrust via additional input.
[128:46.53]When fighting a Great Serpent, a long blade of light will appear, revealing the armament's true power.
[128:55.02]So, should I take off?
[128:55.76]Should I try to get to medium load?
[128:58.74]Or, I don't know.
[128:59.28]Let me, let me, what does this do?
[129:06.94]Alright, it's like a... Why...
[129:12.48]Okay, so let's... I gotta get to medium load.
[129:18.17]Okay, there it is.
[129:18.87]Alright, I'm... ...gimmick fight.
[129:22.19]I'm ready for the gimmick fight.
[129:24.15]There's a beam.
[129:27.95]Oh, shit.
[129:31.42]Does the R2 do it too?
[129:33.62]Alright.
[129:36.48]Need both headphones for this.
[129:44.57]God-devouring serpent.
[129:50.45]It missed!
[130:06.48]Fuck it.
[130:06.74]Oh, don't.
[130:07.18]Not a bad idea.
[130:29.84]You need to go upgrade it?
[130:38.76]I'm not gonna upgrade this fucking thing.
[130:40.88]What do you mean go upgrade it?
[130:45.06]You died to the gimmick boss.
[130:47.11]Shut up.
[130:49.31]I'm not gonna go quick, but like if I just... No, I was doing pretty good damage.
[130:52.86]I'm fine.
[130:54.78]Boys!
[131:08.63]There are too many chandeliers in here.
[131:11.43]Let's go, boys!
[131:23.01]I'm so confused what just happened.
[131:38.75]Where the fuck am I?
[131:40.61]What's going on?
[131:54.41]What does that mean?
[132:22.24]Aye.
[132:25.38]He got me, he got me, he got me, he got me, he got me.
[132:27.19]I'm okay.
[132:47.14]He's two.
[132:52.32]Fuck!
[132:53.12]It's an extra half second.
[132:54.18]It's fine.
[132:54.60]I'm alright.
[132:54.94]I'm fine.
[132:55.20]I'm fine.
[133:21.03]Stop it!
[133:29.59]Oh my god!
[133:30.37]This poison MRA all over me!
[133:32.64]This poison all over me!
[133:37.10]Fuck!
[133:37.60]What happened?
[133:38.32]How did I?
[133:41.50]Why did I end up over here?
[133:42.92]Do L2 twice?
[133:48.29]There's poison all over me.
[133:50.11]I'm turning into a Boston guy.
[133:52.71]How did I end up all the way over there?
[133:54.15]L2 combo.
[133:56.86]Wait.
[133:59.38]Can I do it twice?
[134:01.34]I can do L2, L2?
[134:05.68]Alright, let's go.
[134:06.48]The boys are not going to do anything here.
[134:08.02]I got it.
[134:08.38]I got it.
[134:08.72]I got it.
[134:09.04]I got it.
[134:09.30]Isaac, be patient.
[134:29.02]Oh shit.
[134:54.56]Get the f- Get out of the fire!
[135:07.22]I can't- I can't- This fight's not hard.
[135:12.80]I'm just so impatient.
[135:27.03]What the fuck?!
[135:32.00]Like little tiny little pieces of fucking fire is what's hurting me?
[135:51.68]Oh my God!
[135:53.15]No!
[135:55.97]God!
[136:09.76]What the fuck is happening?
[136:12.97]Alright, get me the fuck away from him.
[136:14.55]Like, there's all this fire bullshit everywhere.
[136:39.06]What, I didn't have animation control there?
[136:43.97]Why did that not hurt me?
[136:58.73]Oh, the shield.
[136:59.53]Right.
[136:59.75]Alright.
[137:01.03]That was cool.
[137:01.39]That was a cool fight.
[137:04.61]That was really cool.
[137:05.09]It was a gimmick fight, but it was a fun gimmick fight.
[137:08.23]Although, that's probably phase one.
[137:09.77]And phase two, he's going to come out of the head, and he's going to be like, tarnished, tarnished, tarnished, tarnished.
[137:13.53]And then it's like, here comes the real fight, and it's going to be horrible.
[137:43.62]Why does this cut to that?
[138:06.86]This is gonna be fucking hell.
[138:13.99]still to use the gimmick together we will devour the very corner
[138:43.37]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[138:45.59]That was a long... Bro, you hit the ground first.
[138:56.06]The fire follows you.
[139:04.73]I don't know what the hell's happening.
[139:18.59]What?
[139:31.02]Can we stop with that move?
[139:33.78]Can we stop?
[139:41.64]Oh my god!
[139:53.42]Again!
[140:13.66]Oh, fuck that!
[140:14.58]Fuck that!
[140:19.40]Fuck that!
[140:31.85]Get the fuck away from me.
[140:33.05]Go, go, go, go, go.
[140:33.99]Get away from the fire.
[140:34.65]Fire.
[140:35.53]Shit.
[140:38.15]Oh, my God.
[140:38.94]The fucking camera is going to make me shit my pants.
[140:41.46]I swear to God.
[140:42.18]I don't have any mana.
[140:46.52]Oh, I'm fucked.
[140:47.97]Can I even attack him anymore?
[140:54.52]Dude, I, I, I, you have to run from this.
[140:56.72]You gotta, you gotta run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[141:00.07]Don't even go near him.
[141:01.75]Just literally run in a circle until it's over.
[141:09.21]Ah!
[141:13.34]Wait a minute.
[141:15.10]Wait a minute.
[141:17.12]Wait a minute.
[141:17.58]Okay, alright, alright, I get it.
[141:19.26]I get, okay, alright, wait a minute.
[141:23.99]Alright, alright, wait a minute.
[141:26.45]Okay, alright, wait a minute.
[141:37.62]Those motherfuckers come out for a very long time.
[141:45.14]Alright.
[141:47.18]I gotta pee so bad.
[141:47.98]I'll be right back.
[145:03.51]Okay.
[146:44.36]Alright, let's, uh... Let's kill this guy.
[146:48.34]Sound like a plan?
[146:52.80]He's not that bad.
[146:53.65]It's just trying to... Trying to run away...
[146:58.14]From the skull move.
[147:02.14]Seems very, very hard.
[147:03.10]There's probably a way to get away from it.
[147:09.68]I wonder, what's the best way to get away from that?
[147:14.04]Just run?
[147:14.48]I wonder if I just do a full sprint.
[147:28.70]You need to try to stun lock his entire second phase.
[147:33.02]Well, let's just hope I can get to the second phase again.
[147:51.07]Okay.
[147:55.59]Oh, you're gonna jump over that shit?
[147:57.11]I don't know.
[148:09.07]Getting too greedy.
[148:20.98]Not locked on, that's bad news!
[148:53.91]Oh!
[149:00.28]Oh, I don't want that army for this shit.
[149:02.98]It's on me.
[149:03.52]Fuck, I'm poisoned.
[149:04.36]Fuck!
[149:17.91]Fuck!
[149:24.52]Shit.
[149:49.70]Nope.
[150:01.91]Alright.
[150:04.79]Go get him, boys!
[150:16.55]What is that?
[150:17.89]Oh, he's already doing this fucking move.
[150:20.01]He's already doing it?
[150:28.61]He hits the ground?
[150:34.16]Shit, my fucking pants.
[150:44.10]Alright, now run!
[151:17.89]Is it item?
[151:23.23]Whose fucking costume is this?
[151:35.99]Ayy!
[151:53.72]Fuck off!
[151:59.88]Oh shit!
[152:01.92]Oh!
[152:02.14]Should I jump?
[152:05.77]How are you supposed to get away from that?
[152:11.35]The jump?
[152:18.42]I don't understand that move.
[152:19.64]When he comes, you can't dodge it.
[152:20.92]Do you have to jump over it?
[152:26.23]Can I just outrun it?
[152:29.69]If I just run... This motherfucker, I swear to God.
[152:38.37]I feel like I've dodged it pretty well the last few times.
[152:40.50]It just still hits you with it.
[152:41.22]Dodge later?
[152:43.18]Dodge later?
[152:45.81]It's a fucking slow ass motherfucker, I swear to God.
[152:57.70]Getting greedy.
[152:59.54]That was very greedy.
[153:02.58]Let me try to outrun it, if I just sprint.
[153:04.20]I wonder if it works.
[153:09.95]Come on, do something.
[153:31.23]Ellie.
[153:37.30]Fuck you.
[154:06.44]What?
[154:07.42]Get away from the fucking poison, please.
[154:34.48]I'm gonna try to outrun that move.
[154:35.92]I'm just gonna run.
[154:36.71]If he still hits me, then it's your fault because you told me to do it.
[154:44.14]Oh, come on!
[155:08.08]Do it again!
[155:14.65]Again!
[155:14.93]Again!
[155:15.39]Again!
[155:16.11]Again!
[155:32.94]Again!
[155:51.54]Again!
[155:51.78]Oh, I'm out of mana!
[156:22.27]Where the fuck am I?
[156:31.05]Oh shit, he changed his fucking combo up.
[156:34.17]Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
[157:06.53]damn that was crazy so honestly the he's not dead
[157:24.96]Alright, the strategy there, honestly, was just to eat the flame skulls.
[157:29.89]And just try to dodge them.
[157:30.81]Don't run.
[157:31.23]Damn.
[157:34.79]Alright, cool.
[157:45.25]Also, you just gotta go aggressive.
[157:50.51]The chatter was right.
[157:53.60]I've just taken too much time to try to just wait for him to do something.
[157:56.74]Just get in there and just have mana potions and L2, L2 and just unlock the fuck out of him.
[158:01.01]Just keep hitting him over and over again.
[158:05.73]That was a cool fight.
[158:06.27]That was very cool.
[158:09.21]130,000.
[158:12.95]That's a lot.
[158:13.35]Alright, so let me rest here.
[158:23.68]I said I want a 25 mind, right?
[158:35.21]I wonder what you get for this Remembrance.
[158:41.80]Reload the boss area.
[158:46.66]He's level 106.
[158:53.09]Reload this area.
[158:56.87]Go back to Volcano Manor and come back.
[158:58.31]Alright, well, hold on.
[158:59.11]Let me... Let's do this first.
[159:03.77]I want to see what's in here.
[159:16.64]This boss weapon is amazing.
[159:18.10]I wonder what it is.
[159:18.72]Is it intelligence?
[159:20.29]Intelligence?
[159:26.67]Blasphemous blade.
[159:27.79]Faith.
[159:29.77]Dex and strength.
[159:31.73]Another great faith weapon.
[159:39.63]Some HP is restored upon defeating an enemy.
[159:43.43]Raise the sacred sword aloft to set it ablaze with blasphemous flames.
[159:48.09]They steal HP?
[159:50.65]That sounds insane.
[159:53.13]And this is... Wow, this is 40 int, 18...
[159:57.57]Releases searing spirits that repeatedly explode.
[160:01.22]Oh, it's the skulls.
[160:07.52]Should I get this?
[160:09.70]I don't have any.
[160:10.28]The faith, though.
[160:11.16]No, I'm not.
[160:11.68]It's not going to be close.
[160:12.52]18 faith.
[160:16.14]I'd have to put on a rune, which would get me to 11.
[160:20.08]And then some faith talisman, which would be 16.
[160:27.46]And then a faith helmet, which would get me to 18.
[160:39.47]Could respec too, but is it really worth it?
[160:46.82]The spell is for the birds, don't worry.
[160:50.56]I wonder.
[160:53.08]Not for one spell, not worth it.
[160:56.62]The sword is cool, but I just... It's not this character.
[161:01.30]That looks like it'd be cool too, but... I think I'm just gonna smash it.
[161:11.25]If you do anything, just get the sword instead.
[161:18.26]Me strong would like this?
[161:19.24]Yeah, probably.
[161:22.16]Yeah, I'm gonna break it.
[161:26.27]I'm gonna smash it.
[161:41.14]It's too much faith to have.
[161:42.96]To go respec for one spell, I don't think so.
[161:51.43]Although, I do... I've been neglecting sorcery really badly.
[161:54.71]So, like, the last few, um... Last few streams.
[161:59.52]I... I think I'm gonna have to go get a couple of good spells.
[162:04.42]These are... Comet's really good.
[162:07.33]Swift Glenstone's alright for, like, range, but I don't know.
[162:09.39]I should probably upgrade the, uh, staff as well.
[162:22.37]Go kill the dragon in the Rani area.
[162:25.17]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[162:26.13]I'll go do that.
[162:30.17]That's the best spell in the whole game.
[162:31.27]Okay.
[162:35.58]I'll go get it.
[162:39.06]But first... Literally almost everything from the volcano east needs faith.
[162:52.92]Alright, let me upgrade my staff.
[162:56.46]I think I might be able to upgrade the boys as well.
[163:04.46]Smithing Stone 8.
[163:05.10]These are very high.
[163:08.60]Okay.
[163:09.40]How about you?
[163:09.86]Can I upgrade anybody?
[163:14.08]I can upgrade the boys.
[163:21.41]Boys plus nine.
[163:23.55]What a waste of fucking materials.
[163:26.55]Let's go.
[163:37.13]Who else do I want to try?
[163:38.33]Oleg is plus four, but we got a lot of other, we got other ones too.
[163:43.78]Maybe the snake.
[163:46.00]That sounds kind of fun.
[163:54.35]I have the Mimic, but we don't like the Mimic anymore.
[163:58.61]Got nerfed.
[164:06.86]I think we're gonna go Snake, friend.
[164:12.82]I think I'm choosing the boys and the Snake.
[164:21.09]Either that...
[164:25.12]All these little weird fucks right here.
[164:26.78]I'm going to try... I'm going to do snake.
[164:48.87]I already... I have the mimic plus seven.
[164:50.23]I...
[164:54.47]Yeah, this thing is probably amazing, too.
[164:57.87]Perfumer is probably amazing.
[165:02.66]Still the best, even with the nerfs.
[165:05.58]Mimic is still the best.
[165:06.84]Alright, well, I want to do the snake.
[165:10.74]I'm going for it.
[165:12.08]It's Grave, Glove, Wart.
[165:14.20]Which... Okay.
[165:20.38]Yeah.
[165:20.86]Yep.
[165:22.02]Yep!
[165:26.99]Alright.
[165:27.69]Okay.
[165:28.74]Snake time.
[165:32.62]We have to change this.
[165:38.78]Uh, how do I open up the... Okay, the pouch is right here.
[165:43.34]The dogs are gone.
[165:44.18]We're gonna replace it with the snake.
[165:48.59]I got the boys at plus nine.
[165:59.93]And you better believe the boys are going to be plus 10 in the end here.
[166:09.43]I'm going to get the snake up after.
[166:13.79]Very cool.
[166:16.16]In the meantime, I have to go... Let me do this first.
[166:22.46]Let's clean up the manor a little bit.
[166:24.20]And then I'm going to go kill the dragon in front of Randy's castle.
[166:32.56]Let me do this.
[166:32.96]These bell bearing.
[166:46.00]Oh, right.
[166:47.14]These.
[166:54.59]Oh, these grave?
[166:55.79]No, these are ghost glove wards, not grave glove wards.
[166:58.47]All right.
[167:00.87]Okay, let's go.
[167:05.19]Let's move to... I'm going to go to the manor.
[167:07.47]Okay, so from here, I'm going to go talk to Z... Z... Z... Zorias?
[167:21.01]Have you done the capital?
[167:28.05]I have done the capital.
[167:40.02]I don't know if I've done the entire capital, but I did the major bosses in the capital.
[167:45.15]And I did a lot of the sewer.
[167:47.41]And did the dung eater stuff.
[167:54.21]Get the giant rat ashes.
[168:00.64]It's too on brand for me.
[168:02.52]I'm going to go with the snake.
[168:20.44]Yeah, I fought the, I fought the Dung Raider.
[168:21.74]Kicked his ass.
[168:25.00]Alright, so this, I needed to go... Where, where, where was she?
[168:32.72]She was down... Oh, where was she?
[168:35.91]On the map now.
[168:37.73]Will you get the fuck away from me?
[168:39.63]You little weirdo.
[168:42.68]Uh, she's, like, over here, right?
[168:46.55]Can I drop down?
[168:49.33]Where the hell is she?
[168:50.19]She's, like, down here, right?
[168:58.55]Yeah.
[169:02.91]You're not gonna... Okay.
[169:04.51]So, uh... Hello.
[169:08.96]You're not willing to kill me, are you?
[169:16.24]I thought that was like a scary moment.
[169:18.70]I was like, why is it red?
[169:23.93]Don't give it.
[169:24.69]Reloaded again?
[169:46.53]And I can just do this, right?
[169:47.60]I can just quit the game and come back.
[169:50.00]That works, right?
[170:26.19]I was supposed to protect her.
[170:30.84]Uriah's letter.
[170:32.70]And Edekar's woe.
[170:37.54]Brought me a letter.
[170:39.76]What does it say?
[170:47.51]Farewell letter written... Okay, she's alive.
[170:53.19]I wish to set out on a journey so that one day I can carry on Mother's work.
[170:57.37]Be the proud daughter of Tanith of Volcano Manor.
[171:00.76]Farewell.
[171:01.60]You've always been so kind, so uncompromising, my champion.
[171:06.76]She's alive.
[171:07.22]She just left a few trinkets.
[171:10.80]Should have fucking killed her.
[171:19.31]Should have killed her.
[171:28.43]Increases damage taken.
[171:30.55]It is said that this woman named Dedica indulged in every form of adultery and wicked pleasure imaginable, giving birth to a myriad of grotesque children.
[171:48.02]Okay.
[171:48.94]Another one of those from software, what's the point of this items?
[171:56.39]This just makes the game hard.
[172:05.81]I'm not going to keep it on.
[172:08.83]It's for masochists.
[172:17.56]I wonder if she shows up again later.
[172:19.88]Well, now, this is going to be very interesting.
[172:23.50]What do they have to say about this?
[172:34.16]She's probably going to be pissed.
[172:40.87]Yeah.
[172:41.23]Hi.
[172:41.73]It's me.
[172:43.85]I uh... I fucked up.
[172:46.64]You.
[172:48.08]It's true then.
[172:50.50]You've defeated our lord.
[172:52.26]I did.
[172:53.30]No.
[172:55.50]I must thank you.
[172:58.51]Our lord was yet weak.
[173:01.51]You have taught us that.
[173:03.13]Defeat is not the end.
[173:05.83]Our lord is immortal.
[173:09.13]You mean like tomorrow when I load the next day on the bonfire.
[173:15.24]It's gonna be like an ultra version or something, right?
[173:22.03]You're gonna leave.
[173:24.35]Wait, you're gonna rope us all into this and then leave?
[173:27.57]I killed people.
[173:28.37]I killed people for you.
[173:29.46]For like this whole little fucking club we're in.
[173:50.35]I killed my own, like, friends and tarnished and shit and now you just visit?
[173:56.75]Where are you going?
[173:57.31]You kidding me?
[174:06.26]Can you fucking- I can't believe this.
[174:14.27]My thanks.
[174:16.38]Oh, that was that guy that was here.
[174:17.74]All right.
[174:18.00]So, hey, can you guys believe what's going on here?
[174:20.30]Can you believe it, everybody?
[174:23.24]It's just me and you.
[174:26.34]Are you and I the only two suckers left here?
[174:30.47]So, you killed Rykard.
[174:33.97]I harbor you no ill will.
[174:37.68]The strong take.
[174:39.80]Such is our code.
[174:42.30]Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh.
[174:48.49]But any road the volcano manor is no more.
[174:51.65]Though we may yet fulfill an old promise.
[174:54.79]We hunted our own kind and took what was theirs.
[174:59.57]And with everything in hand the time has come to rise against the earth tree.
[175:08.20]oh greater will hear my voice I am the recusant bernard inheritor of my brother's will and you will fall to my blade you want to kill the greater will consider this fair warning the greater will that seems that that seems kind of like an entity you can't like go near
[175:35.23]You're like angry at essentially magic air, right?
[175:39.62]Like the greater will.
[175:40.88]It's not like a person.
[175:42.02]It's not a thing.
[175:43.38]It's like a concept.
[175:48.46]It's the force.
[175:52.78]Okay, well that's cool.
[175:55.29]So now let's go talk to Patches and then I'm going to go to the boss room because everyone said to go there.
[176:00.69]What does Patches say?
[176:07.13]You're still here.
[176:08.01]Now you've gone and killed Reikard?
[176:11.79]You scheming little bastard.
[176:13.41]Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical.
[176:19.28]Perhaps a tarnished will be Elden Lord after all.
[176:22.64]But for now, this manor is finished.
[176:26.17]The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.
[176:31.29]A fine mess.
[176:33.17]But how else could it end?
[176:35.05]When Daddy Ambition's head over heels courting lady blasphemy.
[176:42.01]Yep.
[176:42.53]Well, here I am.
[176:44.37]Untethered once again.
[176:46.49]Goodbye, my friend.
[176:48.47]Goodbye.
[176:48.89]Yeah.
[176:49.23]You ever kick me down a fucking ditch again?
[176:56.74]Two or three hundred feet up?
[176:58.02]And leave me?
[176:59.78]I'm gonna smash your fucking head with a mallet like Galaga used to do.
[177:19.24]That guy used to smash watermelons.
[177:21.12]What a weird thing.
[177:23.48]You guys remember the comedian Gallagher?
[177:27.33]Guy would literally just, he would go on stage and he would just put up watermelons and everybody in the front four or five rows would be in like plastic.
[177:38.49]And his routine was he would just go up there with a mallet and smash them.
[177:48.51]That was his main part of his routine.
[177:51.23]Was just smashing fucking watermelons.
[177:58.06]Now that I think back, what a fucking crazy routine.
[178:00.84]Everyone would be like, oh my god, it got on us.
[178:05.22]It was like being on a ride, like Splash Mountain or something, right?
[178:08.23]Like, what the fuck?
[178:14.25]Now that's entertainment.
[178:17.42]You dreamed that.
[178:18.44]No, I didn't.
[178:20.00]I did not.
[178:23.25]That is not what I did.
[178:25.59]You will never be as funny as Galaga.
[178:31.11]Wait, what's this room?
[178:34.78]This is a scary room.
[178:35.52]What is this room?
[178:36.24]Have I been in here?
[178:42.22]Oh, I've been in here.
[178:45.55]Alright, it's time to go to the boss room and see what's in here.
[179:02.20]Back?
[179:08.66]Is back.
[179:17.69]Oh, he's growing back.
[179:18.97]Can I kill it again?
[179:29.45]Who's that?
[179:30.15]Who's eating him?
[179:33.82]Who's this?
[179:34.26]No.
[179:34.36]No.
[179:34.48]This is all so wrong.
[179:36.66]This is all so wrong.
[179:38.58]This is where I would just drop a grenade and just go this way and run.
[179:44.37]And just fucking leave.
[180:03.95]I don't know about this.
[180:05.89]What?
[180:39.58]Hey, what'd I tell ya?
[180:43.30]One day, you and I, we're gonna meet blows.
[180:46.45]And today is that day.
[181:09.73]Oh, he's mad.
[181:13.39]Hey!
[181:36.35]Stop panic dodging.
[181:53.26]Put your fucking guard down.
[182:06.24]Oof.
[182:37.75]Oh shit!
[182:38.25]I thought it was gonna be a smaller cone than that!
[182:52.68]Bye-bye.
[182:55.82]Aspects of the crucible breath.
[183:08.30]And you dropped something too.
[183:14.77]Mask.
[183:16.99]Oh, man.
[183:28.35]That.
[183:36.15]Where is it?
[183:42.30]Ask one by Tanith, Lady of the Volcano Manor, in the image of a foreign queen.
[183:46.32]Increases dexterity.
[183:48.00]Oh.
[183:50.60]Long ago, when Rykard first set eyes on Tanith, she was working as a dancer in a foreign land.
[183:55.42]Soon he made her his consort.
[183:57.91]She was the only human to remain by his side when he became the Serpent of Blasphemy.
[184:04.83]It's only one dex, too.
[184:06.03]What about the robes?
[184:11.64]Onsort's robes.
[184:16.81]Sucks ass.
[184:19.65]Why did he kill her?
[184:22.95]She's literally eating this guy.
[184:24.59]And I... They were bad.
[184:30.25]I'm sorry.
[184:30.65]If I'm gonna kill an NPC, I'm gonna kill the NPC that's literally eating the boss to try to become as strong as the boss and become the boss.
[184:36.74]I'm gonna kill that NPC.
[184:42.13]So now if I go back to the manor, wait, let me reload here.
[184:47.83]They're gone.
[184:48.53]So what if I go back to the actual, the manor?
[184:51.75]Is there anything there?
[184:54.71]They weren't on the protect list, no.
[185:06.24]Nothing here, no item.
[185:07.18]All right, well, I'm imagining that breath is like frog breath, right?
[185:16.22]not a sorcery so it's definitely yeah it's an incantation yeah there it is throat pouch to spew fire all right next on the agenda volcano manor is pretty much complete there's probably a few things I didn't do but you know me strong will take care of it eventually I want to I want to go and kill let's go to the yeah here
[185:49.43]There's a dragon here that drops a spell.
[185:51.33]I want it.
[185:51.69]Go to the plateau.
[185:56.23]Plateau south of... Plateau.
[186:04.88]Down.
[186:05.28]Down here.
[186:05.66]Back to Rani's Rise.
[186:09.30]That's what I was saying, yeah.
[186:10.94]Down here?
[186:12.62]You want to talk about this jail?
[186:13.86]Did I do this?
[186:18.34]I buy runes.
[186:22.22]Top of the map.
[186:23.67]Not the jail, the church.
[186:28.57]Each room?
[186:30.83]Oh, there is a... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[186:33.87]There is a dragon here.
[186:34.51]You're right.
[186:38.29]There was a dragon here, wasn't there?
[186:49.29]Kill it.
[186:52.31]Where you at?
[186:58.75]Okay, he's literally right here.
[187:03.63]Got a lot of fucking health.
[187:35.76]Oh, shit!
[187:38.04]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[187:40.75]Can't get off the horse!
[187:41.99]I forgot I've rebound the damn thing to triangle and up on D-pad.
[188:02.27]What?
[188:12.09]What the fuck?
[188:12.81]Oh, okay.
[188:13.23]What are you doing?
[188:18.08]Why would I use magic against the fucking magic dragon?
[188:25.87]Got it.
[188:29.27]Got it.
[189:00.64]coming down
[189:32.96]That was 10 feet!
[189:41.69]That was like 10 feet!
[189:44.27]That was not far!
[189:46.83]How far?
[189:47.69]Give me a clip.
[189:49.27]Give me a fucking clip.
[189:50.25]That was like... I am fucking flabbergasted.
[189:53.77]That was like 10 feet.
[190:12.03]That was so small!
[190:13.47]I hate that face I made that like... Get fucking out of here.
[190:21.93]That was so small.
[190:24.33]Give me a fucking break.
[190:25.67]That was tiny.
[190:28.31]That was not far.
[190:29.47]Nice cringe face.
[190:31.77]Whatever.
[190:32.21]That was stupid.
[190:33.41]You'll be good this time.
[190:37.52]That was doing fine.
[190:43.83]Yeah, come on.
[191:43.23]Finally!
[191:44.27]Oh my god, that cracked.
[191:49.39]What?! !
[191:52.24]Oh, fuck.
[192:33.61]Let's go.
[193:05.85]No!
[193:40.56]Watch out for that shit!
[194:23.96]Get off!
[194:25.42]Fine.
[194:43.81]Oh my god!
[194:45.09]Hide in the building!
[194:46.15]Hide in the building!
[194:47.45]Hide in the building!
[194:57.78]Oh fuck, I'm good.
[195:29.31]What, did I just hit him in the air?
[195:30.43]What the fuck just happened?
[195:32.88]What?
[195:33.52]I just launched him like a thousand feet in the air.
[195:37.12]He was like, get up boy!
[195:39.08]What are you doing?
[195:51.53]Jesus Christ.
[195:53.99]A doula's moon blade?
[195:59.70]You guys didn't do shit.
[196:01.01]You guys didn't do anything.
[196:02.27]You just sat there like this.
[196:04.69]I'm very disappointed in you.
[196:06.89]You are plus nine.
[196:08.25]I fed you four or five of you dickheads so much grave glove war.
[196:15.03]You're gonna be bloated later.
[196:16.52]You're gonna be bloated.
[196:17.70]I can't believe they didn't do anything.
[196:19.40]Alright, so what was that?
[196:26.82]Sweeping slash old projectile.
[196:31.72]It conjures a cold magic greatsword, then delivers a sweeping blow that launches a blade-like projectile of frost.
[196:36.50]It can be cast repeatedly.
[196:47.18]120,000 souls, too.
[196:48.64]Jesus.
[196:51.08]I didn't even get those, either.
[196:52.09]Oh my god.
[196:53.13]Holy shit.
[196:58.09]I'm going to level up like two or three times.
[197:00.66]Alright, there was another dragon here, wasn't there?
[197:03.43]Here.
[197:05.95]I remember there was a dragon that hung out here, wasn't there?
[197:08.15]Or am I crazy?
[197:14.89]Oh, that was the same one.
[197:15.89]Oh, okay.
[197:17.73]He just moves around.
[197:20.38]Alright, well let me try that spell.
[197:26.46]There's your 25, mind.
[197:30.89]That's pretty good.
[197:36.22]I still have a lot of souls.
[197:37.76]How much is it to level up?
[197:39.62]Oh, okay.
[197:40.03]I can do it again.
[197:41.75]So now what do I focus on?
[197:42.77]Do I just dump points and intelligence?
[197:46.65]Or should I get up to 50 vigor?
[197:50.42]Probably vigor, I would imagine.
[197:57.34]Get to 60 and do both.
[198:00.54]I'll go back and forth between the two.
[198:04.38]Let's get into 60.
[198:05.12]Okay.
[198:11.52]Okay, this spell is dog shit.
[198:13.74]Get rid of it.
[198:15.03]I have this Adula's Moonblade, which is going to be insane.
[198:20.43]I use Starlight all the time.
[198:22.63]Swift is good.
[198:23.35]Comet is good.
[198:23.87]I don't have anything better, though.
[198:29.16]Okay, did they buff some of this shit to not be awful?
[198:39.63]Which one of these is actually worth using now?
[198:42.93]Crystal Barrage is terrible, but... Are some of these actually worth using and they're not just terrible?
[198:48.10]The Arc is better now?
[198:51.60]The Comet?
[198:54.54]Um... I don't have that.
[198:58.14]What about, like, Night Comet or something?
[199:00.70]Great Bow is good now.
[199:02.14]Great Glenstone Shard was buffed.
[199:05.34]That's just better.
[199:08.04]That's cost less, too.
[199:09.08]Maybe I'll try that instead of the, um... than a Comet.
[199:19.12]There's an Ice spell that's like Comet?
[199:21.46]Did they make... Okay.
[199:22.64]Question.
[199:23.20]Question.
[199:25.55]Is Meteor any good?
[199:27.49]Because this was terrible, terrible.
[199:29.85]Like, truly terrible.
[199:31.15]Truly awful.
[199:35.53]It's still useless?
[199:41.52]How about Night Comet?
[199:43.24]Eh, I'll put it on there.
[199:44.72]Alright, let's see how cool this move is.
[199:50.82]Yeah, okay.
[199:51.22]Can I charge it?
[199:56.70]Holy shit.
[200:00.68]That's an arc.
[200:04.08]How far does it go?
[200:07.72]And with member, this is important.
[200:11.22]This staff is reduces casting time of sorceries.
[200:19.41]So that actually is really quickly happening here.
[200:24.45]That looks awesome.
[200:26.99]You can multi-hit.
[200:31.89]You get a better meteor later on.
[200:36.60]Fight the guy at the bottom of the tower.
[200:38.12]Okay.
[200:40.76]Say so.
[200:45.03]One of the best AoE trash killing spells.
[200:47.21]It feels like it.
[200:47.93]It's a huge arc.
[200:49.89]I wonder how it does damage-wise.
[200:56.34]Oh shit.
[200:59.30]Talk?
[201:29.00]Who's that?
[201:29.38]Who the fuck is this person?
[201:32.67]Can we talk?
[201:34.97]He's one of the assassins?
[201:45.54]Why would I be fighting him?
[201:49.28]Why would I fight Blade?
[201:52.86]I don't think I should fight Blade.
[201:54.56]I like this guy.
[201:56.78]He's lost.
[201:57.42]He lost his mind.
[201:59.81]What?
[202:03.17]Oh.
[202:15.22]Oh, shit.
[202:15.54]He is crazy.
[202:34.70]Holy shit, how much damage did I do?
[202:36.72]Did you see what I just did?
[202:51.63]Why was I just floating in the air?
[203:02.40]Oh my god!
[203:03.00]I got him!
[203:15.59]What?
[203:16.09]No!
[203:16.69]I... Why is everybody getting killed?
[203:19.77]Royal Greatsword in all of his armor.
[203:23.95]I really liked that guy.
[203:32.55]So he went mad.
[203:33.33]Okay, so he went mad.
[203:34.94]This is int.
[203:39.36]Greatsword decorated in royal carrion style, favored weapon of Blyde, the half-wolf.
[203:44.94]In defiance of the fate he was born to, Blyde swore to serve no master but Rani.
[203:51.48]As proof, the sword was imbued with a cold magic at the moment the oath was sworn.
[203:55.07]Confused the greatsword with frost and performed a forward somersault.
[204:03.06]That's awesome looking.
[204:07.22]I can't do it, but that's cool.
[204:10.47]That's a beautiful weapon.
[204:16.99]Oh, that's... That's a beautiful weapon.
[204:21.99]Very cool.
[204:25.40]So what about the armor?
[204:27.90]I would feel kind of icky putting on the armor.
[204:30.10]Don't you think so?
[204:34.28]It doesn't feel right.
[204:40.53]Well-worn black armor of the man-wolf blade.
[204:43.29]The pelt serves as a cape protecting from cold.
[204:46.33]The blade was the blade of Ronnie, but the cold bothered him anyway.
[204:51.18]Is that a Frozen reference?
[204:55.22]Did they actually put that in?
[204:56.72]That seems really out of place.
[205:08.99]But the cold bothered him anyway.
[205:13.37]Odd.
[205:16.15]Um.
[205:20.33]The scaled armor is better.
[205:21.37]It just is.
[205:27.17]Gauntlets are good, though.
[205:27.87]Put the gauntlets on.
[205:30.22]Do I have anything better?
[205:31.28]These are.
[205:31.68]It's still medium load.
[205:32.52]Scaled gauntlet.
[205:33.50]This is better.
[205:34.08]It just is.
[205:44.11]Oh, but I can stay if I put Blade's Greaves on.
[205:46.61]Still medium load, yo.
[205:53.04]I feel like the scaled armor is some of the best armor in the game.
[205:57.76]Very interesting.
[205:58.98]Very cool.
[206:00.58]Very cool.
[206:06.63]Okay.
[206:09.15]George R.R.
[206:09.59]Martin is a huge Frozen fan.
[206:11.05]Really?
[206:11.37]That's funny.
[206:13.57]Alright.
[206:15.27]That takes care of that.
[206:16.51]Should I go?
[206:17.07]What about... Did I do all this?
[206:18.97]There's still this.
[206:19.65]I don't understand this.
[206:21.51]I don't know where this person is.
[206:22.49]I don't know where this person even is.
[206:30.63]But I'll go see if he's in there.
[206:36.14]Go up and go to Ronnie's... Go up to Ronnie's room.
[206:40.62]Maybe like up here?
[206:45.71]Go talk to the Ronnie doll?
[206:50.93]Ronnie doll up here.
[206:59.20]Yeah, I did Ronnie's quest.
[207:11.01]I did complete Ronnie's quest, the whole thing.
[207:29.09]Not here.
[207:29.37]How did I not have this?
[207:37.54]Go to the other tower.
[207:39.60]No.
[207:46.50]Oh, I can... Get the grace.
[207:49.48]Why is my cam so small?
[207:57.23]I don't want to take up that much space.
[207:58.51]There's some of this stuff to see on the screen.
[208:03.19]Okay, so I can talk to the doll.
[208:07.90]I take it thou hast noticed.
[208:10.90]I shouldn't be surprised.
[208:13.08]I thought I might expound a little further, upon the order I envision.
[208:18.76]Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night.
[208:25.07]I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet.
[208:28.77]As it is now, life and souls and order are bound tightly together.
[208:35.10]But I would have them at a great remove.
[208:38.14]And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch all become impossibilities.
[208:46.67]Which is why I would abandon this soil.
[208:49.29]What?
[208:49.61]With mine order.
[208:51.19]Wouldst thou come to me even now?
[208:53.97]My one and only lord.
[208:59.88]You want to get rid of all of our five senses?
[209:06.02]Touch.
[209:06.64]Sight.
[209:07.36]Smell.
[209:09.10]Taste.
[209:11.96]Gravity.
[209:12.36]Touch.
[209:20.37]Sight.
[209:21.71]Smell.
[209:22.11]Touch.
[209:25.07]Sight.
[209:25.49]Smell.
[209:26.81]Taste.
[209:32.28]Water?
[209:32.60]No.
[209:35.34]Hearing.
[209:35.74]So she wants to remove all of our senses?
[209:44.25]No, I don't want to do that.
[209:47.33]Wait, you mean you tell me I'll never be able to taste a steak again?
[209:50.19]I don't know if we can do that, Ronnie.
[209:52.43]I don't think I can do that.
[210:02.66]I got another great run.
[210:08.01]She's making a utopia.
[210:14.94]We don't know that.
[210:15.62]I walked through like a lake of rotten stuff.
[210:23.14]Grabbed a ring and put it on her finger and all of a sudden I'm just supposed to trust everything that she says?
[210:27.21]Yes.
[210:35.97]Yes.
[210:38.83]He wants to free the souls.
[210:42.40]What about what I want to do?
[210:52.09]Do I get to make a few stipulations here?
[210:53.75]Fuck again.
[211:03.13]Look, if I'm gonna do all the work, um, then I get to make a few, like, I get to make a few amendments to this.
[211:12.16]Okay, yeah, you can remove all of our senses except for once on Friday.
[211:16.32]Friday, or Saturday, no, on Thursday.
[211:19.13]We get to taste food on Thursday.
[211:25.11]And then that, that's fine.
[211:26.93]I want once a week.
[211:32.09]And I also require, on Thursday as well, to get to be able to feel that feeling of really digging in deep and getting a wicked huge booger out of your nose that's been bothering you for like an hour.
[211:43.25]I want to be able to have that feeling.
[211:44.29]It feels great.
[211:45.77]Sometimes happens in the shower.
[212:00.12]Alright, what else do you want to do?
[212:01.00]I don't want it to be cold.
[212:01.68]Chilly nights?
[212:02.22]No.
[212:02.30]I don't know about that.
[212:03.74]It seems kind of, like, depressing.
[212:04.90]It's, like, cold and dark.
[212:05.84]Not, like... I don't know.
[212:07.23]I don't know.
[212:07.61]I don't like that.
[212:08.45]Chilly.
[212:32.02]All right, well, that's kind of cool.
[212:32.98]Let's go that way.
[212:44.87]We know you're doing the dung eater ending.
[212:46.96]I mean, I don't even, I don't know what ending I'm going to do.
[212:50.60]All I'm saying is as of this moment right now, I don't like being cold.
[212:55.22]I keep my place pretty warm.
[212:57.92]We've had this conversation.
[212:58.92]I don't want to be like freezing out in like some fucking chilly night thing.
[213:04.52]No.
[213:06.06]I think... 72 to 73 degrees.
[213:08.08]I like... I like my place to be like 72.
[213:12.20]73.
[213:12.30]I like it hot.
[213:19.79]Okay, let's go over here and see what's in that tower.
[213:25.13]That's the correct temperature.
[213:26.43]You wouldn't believe how many people think I am an insane person for wanting to have my place be like 73 degrees.
[213:36.54]Am I the crazy one?
[213:39.52]Somewhere between 73 and 74 I think is a perfect indoor temperature.
[213:47.19]Is that that weird?
[213:49.25]I don't think it is.
[213:49.87]And I don't know how people... Oh yeah, I like it like 63, 64.
[213:53.97]I would die in that temp.
[213:58.31]I would die in that temp.
[213:59.29]64, 65?
[213:59.33]That's way too cold.
[214:00.79]62.
[214:00.81]60?
[214:00.87]No.
[214:00.99]No.
[214:16.86]68.
[214:16.96]Okay, I can understand 68.
[214:18.42]Like 66 to 68, 69.
[214:22.32]Anything under 66, 65 is... That's way... 64?
[214:26.70]No, way too cold.
[214:29.23]I already did this.
[214:31.07]So, I'll just go in it so we can... Anything under 71.
[214:37.65]I'd say 70 is fine.
[214:39.25]70 is getting there, but I think 68 is the lowest I would be comfortable.
[214:44.65]Maybe a little higher.
[214:47.32]Less than 68 is also psychotic.
[214:50.90]I did, sorry.
[214:54.38]Alright.
[214:57.00]Cool.
[214:58.88]It's time.
[215:01.86]It's time to go towards this, what I assume is one of the final areas of the game.
[215:12.67]I'm gonna go for it.
[215:19.14]Let's do it.
[215:20.41]I'm very excited.
[215:27.95]Oh, I didn't go to that.
[215:29.49]Me strong will take care of that.
[215:32.97]Alright, so how do I get there?
[215:48.22]Can I make this jump?
[215:49.42]Not that I really want.
[215:50.12]Yeah, I... Can I?
[216:00.27]It looks like I can.
[216:00.95]I can't.
[216:04.87]Are you planning on beating the game tonight?
[216:08.63]I would highly, highly doubt that.
[216:18.35]I'm going to assume that this whole area up here at the very least would take probably a whole stream.
[216:28.62]But we'll see.
[216:29.14]I want to go take a look.
[216:37.27]It's at least probably three or four more streams.
[216:38.73]Yeah, whatever.
[216:39.49]Look, I'm...
[216:42.15]There's always that theory, right?
[216:43.49]Where, oh, I'm playing the same thing over and over again.
[216:46.81]And it's the same game.
[216:48.53]And people are getting tired of the same game over and over.
[216:50.73]And people want to see something else.
[216:52.18]And I think this has been really great.
[216:56.08]I've been having a great time.
[216:59.22]So I don't have a reason not to just keep playing this until I'm satisfied with it, right?
[217:07.95]Somebody said go to the one near the tree.
[217:21.22]There's a lot of people here.
[217:22.12]I'm really actually very, very surprised at the amount of people that are here.
[217:26.89]I was thinking, right, the first stream had a lot.
[217:30.85]Like, there was like 15,000 to 20,000 people on that first stream or two.
[217:33.49]And it's like, holy shit, that's an insane amount of people to watch me play Elden Ring.
[217:38.94]There's still a lot of people here.
[217:41.12]So, not that I pay that much attention to what that number is.
[217:48.53]I mean, I did not think that this many people were going to watch me, of all people, play this game.
[217:53.29]Because, yeah, maybe after the first few streams or whatever, okay, but I'm still going and people are still here, so I'm going to keep doing it.
[218:01.40]Alright.
[218:02.20]I need to head that way.
[218:13.81]Where do I get over there?
[218:20.54]Go back to that previous bonfire.
[218:23.82]It's fun.
[218:25.84]Oh, this looks like a little place I can go.
[218:37.14]Can I go, like, down here?
[218:44.77]One of the northeast of the city.
[218:48.49]Is this one here?
[218:49.19]Or this one here?
[218:52.92]Yeah, I can't get there from here.
[218:53.88]Probably from here, right?
[218:54.82]Yeah, because I could go, yeah, this way.
[219:03.76]Granny's supposed to be saying the literal opposite of what she says.
[219:06.35]Oh, interesting.
[219:13.05]Alright, so now I gotta get down here.
[219:15.87]Okay.
[219:18.83]Okay.
[219:24.00]This one.
[219:24.28]Go back to the main street.
[219:33.59]You want that central road that had the Erdtree avatar in it.
[219:37.59]Oh!
[219:38.79]I have to go... Okay.
[219:40.52]So I have to go down from here.
[219:47.90]I gotta go, like, this way.
[219:49.46]And then down and around.
[219:50.24]Right?
[219:50.82]Okay.
[219:53.41]I believe this is correct.
[219:55.55]Yeah.
[219:56.37]Okay.
[219:56.61]I know where I'm going.
[220:07.16]Use that blood key item.
[220:10.69]I don't want to summon Mog in an elevator.
[220:24.91]You want to see Mog in an elevator?
[220:26.49]Then just wait for when randomizer mods come out.
[220:31.39]Wait for like the bosses can be enemies mod.
[220:36.69]Okay, so now we gotta go this way.
[220:43.50]And then over here.
[220:46.32]Uh-huh.
[220:54.04]Already a thing.
[220:54.74]I mean, they all existed for Dark Souls 3 and Dark Souls 1.
[220:59.55]There we go.
[221:00.37]This is what we're doing now.
[221:01.87]This is exactly... Okay, so everybody freaked out when I walked down here because they were like, dude, wrong way.
[221:06.15]So now this is the right way.
[221:16.44]I think I already did a little bit of this.
[221:17.68]So let's go.
[221:18.42]Let's just go.
[221:23.54]What level am I?
[221:25.08]I am level 109.
[221:30.23]Which I believe puts me in the level zone of this upcoming end game content area.
[221:36.69]If I were to take a guess.
[221:39.69]Why guess?
[221:47.24]I did that the fucking complete wrong direction.
[221:50.28]Alright, stop being lazy and fight them!
[221:53.17]You are lazy!
[221:55.01]You could have had that easily!
[221:56.41]I'm just like... The fucking laziest sorcerer in the world, just... Like, with my bubble wand, just hopping around like an idiot.
[222:17.91]Yeah, I got this too, you're right.
[222:30.44]I'm gonna go to bog stream instead.
[222:32.06]I have a few unpowered runes.
[222:46.03]I do.
[222:49.34]I really do.
[222:58.14]Oh, what a pain.
[222:59.06]I should... I really should have just... Ah, whatever.
[223:03.38]Godrix is still one of the best.
[223:05.64]When I got the other one and I looked at it, it seemed like it was just better than the other one in every way.
[223:11.37]Godrix increases all your stats by five.
[223:14.37]And Rinala's increases your health, FP, and stamina.
[223:18.97]But that's already happening with Godrix plus five on, like, endurance and shit, right?
[223:24.93]It almost feels like not unnecessary.
[223:35.81]Yeah, I haven't been using any rune arcs.
[223:39.85]It's bad.
[223:40.29]I gotta start using them for bosses.
[223:43.40]Remind me.
[223:50.87]That's literally the best move in the fucking whole game.
[223:58.90]Wait, there's one of these guys here?
[224:25.18]That goes far as fuck.
[224:28.16]What?
[224:31.83]I was just in awe of how crazy that move is.
[224:34.07]Is there another one?
[224:39.85]Ow.
[225:01.36]That's a good move.
[225:07.46]Wait a minute.
[225:18.75]Wait a minute.
[225:24.19]I need to look at something.
[225:39.85]Strengthens cold sorcery.
[225:43.01]That counts, right?
[225:49.04]So, is two intelligence more than what this would give to that spell?
[225:57.44]Or is this better?
[225:58.78]I don't know how much percentage, whatever that means.
[226:03.26]Not at your level.
[226:04.24]Okay.
[226:08.50]Ooh.
[226:08.82]Ooh.
[226:10.93]Okay.
[226:11.63]So I was doing like 350 before.
[226:13.23]I wonder how much it does now.
[226:17.33]That's going to be better.
[226:17.99]Is there anything else that does that?
[226:21.47]Okay.
[226:25.92]Great.
[226:26.68]I don't think I care about HP.
[226:29.60]Vastly raises maximum FP.
[226:31.18]I already have that on.
[226:37.26]Is anything else boost FP?
[226:39.79]No.
[226:39.91]No.
[226:44.82]I already have a lot of this on.
[226:46.03]Do I have anything else?
[226:48.01]Potency of sorceries.
[226:50.89]That would count, right?
[226:52.31]Okay.
[226:59.67]Do I have anything else?
[227:08.70]I think I want to keep the staff on, though.
[227:11.00]And let's send one of these boost cold sorcery, which would be a huge deal.
[227:19.28]Enhances Glintblade sorcery.
[227:20.90]Enhances Crystalline sorcery, not cold.
[227:26.26]Let's find out.
[227:34.38]Let's take a look and see how this is.
[227:39.20]The Renalist Staff does?
[227:42.36]Full Moon spell.
[227:43.34]Do I have the Renalist Staff?
[227:51.77]I don't think I have that.
[227:55.65]No, I don't.
[227:57.81]It's a remembrance.
[228:00.57]But I can go to one of those bells and get it, can't I?
[228:06.16]I didn't use any of the bell demon things.
[228:10.04]I might have to go do that.
[228:12.71]I'm into that.
[228:13.19]That's cool.
[228:24.56]We need 60 in the staff.
[228:26.14]I have 55 right now.
[228:33.65]So, it's not like I won't get there.
[228:36.71]Or I could take a rune.
[228:42.97]Because I'm very curious, because this move is insane.
[228:46.85]That move might actually replace how I feel about the baby rattle.
[228:51.83]Because so far, this has been carrying for essentially the last 30 game hours.
[228:59.46]It's an awesome move.
[229:01.70]But, if that move is that good, which it is, I think I'm going to have to use it.
[229:17.94]Flamedrake Talisman 1?
[229:25.51]The Glintstone?
[229:26.29]Uh, from Cele- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[229:31.51]Maybe.
[229:37.39]Usat's staff is the highest damage staff in the game.
[229:39.51]Yeah, but I mean... You don't have to do the best.
[229:46.43]No?
[229:48.01]It's not about what the best item is, it's what- how much fun you have with whatever you're doing.
[229:54.34]Okay, I need to... One... Alright, sneak.
[229:59.98]Thought I could get it.
[230:18.65]Don't kill me here!
[230:25.15]This guy's on a horse.
[230:26.90]Knight's Greatsword?
[230:27.82]Cool.
[230:29.62]Can I get a... I can't get on a horse here.
[230:31.36]He's allowed on a horse.
[230:32.16]That's not fair.
[230:35.44]One's just better.
[230:36.04]Eh, but... I don't know.
[230:38.76]It's fun to... I like the... I like the staff.
[230:40.82]It's cool.
[230:41.14]I have no mana.
[230:56.29]right now.
[230:56.73]Okay, cool.
[230:58.26]Oh, shit.
[231:37.93]I do have a reaction.
[231:43.74]Remember, you have stylized shots for FP regen.
[231:46.58]Oh, I do.
[231:47.28]You're right.
[231:59.46]Is it retreat?
[232:00.10]No, I thought it was like on fire.
[232:33.52]Anybody could have made that mistake.
[232:34.70]It's the same fucking thing.
[232:38.54]It's literally the same exact entrance.
[232:42.72]Nobody noticed.
[232:46.64]Um, yeah, some people did.
[232:47.88]It's why you said it.
[232:48.70]It's for people to understand that, like, I'm not making shit up.
[233:00.01]Like, I'm not... Hello?
[233:01.37]Why...
[233:08.77]You're not gonna get bigger, are you?
[233:13.65]Can I get something else that's not five and six smithing stones?
[233:21.62]I feel like there's probably a bonfire soon.
[233:22.94]I'm not gonna do a starlight shard.
[233:31.38]Right.
[233:49.88]Turn right.
[233:50.50]What are you talking about?
[233:51.42]Turn right.
[233:59.58]Yeah, it's the Erd tree.
[234:00.62]What do you want?
[234:13.74]No, at the intersection.
[234:21.77]Dude, but, um... I wanted... I'm not gonna not do the elevator first.
[234:39.38]How would I not do this?
[234:52.82]Can we please dial Mog?
[235:02.99]Ooh, it's snowy.
[235:07.31]Ooh.
[235:08.35]Forbidden Lands.
[235:11.06]Oh, shit.
[235:11.62]Alright, hold on.
[235:12.14]I'll go back up.
[235:17.04]This is pretty.
[235:31.06]I am curious what's down that way.
[235:35.08]A mog raided you earlier.
[235:43.90]What?
[235:44.10]Go back down.
[235:57.07]That was a specific jump.
[236:01.25]Oh my god, no!
[236:02.57]What?
[236:02.83]I thought it was... I thought there was... I thought there was collision against wall.
[236:07.31]I thought there... I was just... whatever.
[236:09.07]I thought there was collision with the wall.
[236:12.48]It was... it's not against the wall?
[236:14.16]That doesn't make any sense.
[236:21.98]I was trying to run against the wall so I could just go right into the... so I wouldn't have to jump and get it wrong.
[236:40.81]It's right here.
[236:41.39]It's literally like the first in one second.
[236:45.53]I fucking can't even do this right.
[237:16.50]Everyone seems bored.
[237:18.40]I'm not.
[237:19.00]No, not at all.
[237:19.80]I'm not.
[237:20.08]I'm just fucking relax.
[237:21.28]I'm bored of this because I don't want to fuck it up over and over again.
[237:25.00]Official attire.
[237:32.70]Nobody's probably in here.
[237:38.17]Is this the mayor's office?
[237:40.03]Blade of calling.
[237:40.81]Something's moving on the ground.
[237:55.86]Blade of calling.
[238:10.24]Eighth sword, another faith sword.
[238:13.92]Oh, it's a dagger.
[238:17.84]Power of its former owner, the Kindling Maiden, is still apparent.
[238:23.53]Blade of gold.
[238:24.31]Leap into the air, charging the armament with golden flames that are then shot at the enemy as a single blade-like projectile.
[238:35.05]Okay.
[238:35.67]I got something else, too.
[238:37.41]The official robe.
[238:44.10]Where is it?
[238:46.85]Official's attire.
[238:49.59]Rubby blue robe worn by magistral officials to carry out the grim tasks.
[238:53.70]Surveillance, executions, gruesome rituals, darkest duties drive the wheels of mankind.
[239:05.03]The official robe.
[239:06.35]Found it.
[239:06.65]Okay, now I gotta go back up.
[239:18.93]Because I want to go the other direction.
[239:25.86]The official German 985 rope.
[239:37.19]Can you do the mog dance?
[239:38.45]It's hard.
[239:39.09]I can't.
[239:43.01]I'll try.
[239:43.45]It's hard.
[239:44.77]It's actually really tricky to do it.
[239:46.29]I've seen people do it.
[239:49.39]Right?
[239:49.55]Because it's like a meme because like you fight the fight and his like, his eyes are closed and he opens them and his eyes are closed and when he opens his eyes, you have to hit the eye and the way that it does it, let me try it.
[240:00.53]Because his eyes are like, he closes his eyes like this.
[240:06.87]But it's like, let me see if I get it right.
[240:10.09]Like one, two, one, two, one, two, shake.
[240:15.63]It's a funny dance.
[240:16.88]It's a cute dance.
[240:22.60]Um, I've seen it like a little bit on like YouTube and stuff.
[240:27.86]What's it at now?
[240:29.86]4.5 billion views on YouTube or something.
[240:32.55]It's like took the world by storm.
[240:33.69]It's insane.
[240:34.45]Are we gonna go the other way?
[240:44.66]Yeah, I passed like a bunch of records or something recently.
[240:47.20]Four and a half billion?
[240:48.24]Five billion views?
[240:57.02]A billion of those are probably me.
[241:00.14]Right?
[241:13.18]Thank fucking god for fucking Starlight, kid.
[241:24.38]It's gonna be a monster somewhere.
[241:30.71]Fell twin?
[241:38.23]No, I don't wanna do Starlight again, kid.
[241:43.35]Holy fuck, that hurt you a lot.
[241:46.87]This guy's still running from all the way back there.
[241:53.80]What's wrong with it?
[241:56.68]Oh my god, this move is fucking insane.
[242:01.50]He's still running.
[242:13.23]Where is he?
[242:13.65]He's still running.
[242:19.03]Holy shit.
[242:33.94]Oh my god, that move is fucking crazy.
[242:52.56]What's the crazier with these guys?
[243:00.42]Omen Killer Rollo.
[243:05.59]There's a lot of damage, yeah.
[243:09.61]Bit of both.
[243:11.95]They're just regular mobs.
[243:13.19]Yeah, they kind of are, aren't they?
[243:17.45]They were, yeah.
[243:18.07]They were two mog-like enemies.
[243:26.12]What's this?
[243:26.58]I have another... I have a lot of souls.
[243:39.94]Do we need 60, 70-something thousand?
[243:43.37]74,000.
[243:44.49]Shit.
[243:44.75]Well, whatever.
[243:45.15]What's in here?
[243:45.61]Can I even open this?
[243:49.95]Divine Tower of East Atlas.
[243:55.15]It was the Mogdanoff Twist.
[244:00.48]Oh, this is where I turn on one of the runes.
[244:02.10]Okay, that makes sense.
[244:05.52]It looks like... That looks like I can go there.
[244:07.40]Doesn't it?
[244:07.70]Never mind.
[244:18.73]Remember, you should sub to Atriok on YouTube.
[244:20.43]We're very close to 300k.
[244:21.89]Everyone should sub to Atriok, not just me.
[244:23.75]Hey, you should all go do it right now.
[244:40.08]Stop what you're doing right now and go sub to Atriok on YouTube.
[244:42.56]Do it right now.
[244:43.02]It'll take you two seconds.
[244:53.36]Come right back.
[244:56.28]In fact, leave me open in the tab.
[244:57.44]Go do it right now.
[245:00.94]There you go.
[245:01.24]Just go do it.
[245:02.04]Nothing crazy is going to happen in like the two seconds.
[245:04.16]You're in the tab right now.
[245:04.96]Alright, good.
[245:05.76]I'm just walking around.
[245:06.52]What the fuck?
[245:10.94]What the fuck?
[245:12.14]Oh my god!
[245:13.18]That was fucking insane.
[245:14.92]Okay.
[245:32.59]So whose rune is this?
[245:43.41]I never did this.
[245:45.56]What does his rune do?
[245:52.26]Greatly raises max HP.
[245:54.86]By how much though?
[245:58.90]Raises... I feel like they kind of...
[246:01.92]I feel like they kind of botched this, in a way.
[246:05.79]Because... Raises all attributes, raises health.
[246:10.39]Raises max health, raises health.
[246:12.43]Raises health, raises health.
[246:16.89]Like, I feel like... I wish these were a little different.
[246:23.29]They all kind of do the same thing, but... Maybe some do it a little bit better than the others.
[246:27.49]I would like... I would have loved it if it was like...
[246:30.40]This one is all attributes.
[246:32.00]This one is you do more damage, but take more damage.
[246:34.99]This one is your FP.
[246:37.93]Spell costs are cut in half or something, right?
[246:39.95]These all kind of feel way too similar.
[246:48.85]They're just talismans for that.
[246:51.51]These feel very similar.
[246:52.63]Raises max HP, FP, and stamina.
[246:54.49]Raises max HP.
[246:55.39]It's like, why would you use this one?
[246:59.71]I feel like they keep getting slowly worse.
[247:06.80]Unless that's an insane amount.
[247:12.94]You get to choose what an ember does.
[247:15.64]Yeah, I mean, it's cool, but I think that's the... I think that part of the game for me feels like the least kind of interesting.
[247:30.78]It's not that much of a complaint though, considering.
[247:36.22]Your health bar will cover the entire screen.
[247:41.76]Well, that's cool.
[247:42.98]Um, we can keep going.
[247:43.86]Is there anything else here that I need to see?
[247:46.25]Or is that it?
[247:48.07]Sometimes these towers have weird shit in them.
[247:58.41]That's all?
[247:58.75]Okay.
[248:00.09]Mog is here?
[248:00.73]Mog is not here.
[248:07.41]Yeah, you have to use the rune arc.
[248:08.50]I'm just not using them.
[248:11.36]Why does he hate this game?
[248:12.22]Because it was hyped up and all of the hype fucking failed, man.
[248:20.70]Like, look.
[248:22.69]I mean, look at how big this map is.
[248:26.33]It's annoying.
[248:26.95]It's annoying.
[248:27.37]It's, like, too much.
[248:28.15]It's, like, too much stuff to see.
[248:31.33]They should have just had it, like, be this area here.
[248:33.69]And, like, this is DLC and shit.
[248:35.05]Like, this is just, like, fucking stupid.
[248:37.88]All this up here is just, like, I don't know.
[248:39.64]It's, like, a waste of time.
[248:42.16]They could have, like, condensed this and made it, like, Limgrave and Kaylin.
[248:44.76]That would have been much better.
[248:45.84]It's, like, hyped up.
[248:48.26]Fucking hype is so dumb.
[248:53.70]Alright, let me rest here.
[249:01.35]Yeah, you're, you're, you're going, this is why, like, game design is so fucking stupid.
[249:06.29]You expect me as a player to go, like, walk from here, and eventually go, like, spend all the time to go all the way up here?
[249:15.26]I just don't, I don't understand where, like, where the time, they think we have the time for this.
[249:19.66]It's way too far.
[249:20.36]I need to spend these runes.
[249:45.37]Ooh, this is cool.
[249:47.95]Why don't they let you just buy runes with money?
[249:49.62]I know!
[249:49.92]It's like, what if I don't fucking want to get runes?
[249:52.86]I should be able to spend $9.99 and get like, you know, 30 or 40 thousand souls.
[249:56.36]That was awful.
[250:16.61]These should be loot boxes.
[250:22.43]You just open up to get armor.
[250:26.05]The move is... Okay.
[250:27.82]Seriously?
[250:30.34]Elden box.
[250:31.26]Let me actually go down here.
[250:42.31]Is there a map fragment yet?
[250:43.29]No, not quite.
[250:49.99]You have a horse?
[250:51.87]I know, but I don't want to just, like, this is a cool area.
[250:54.46]I don't want to just run around and forget.
[250:57.74]I don't want to just fucking forget where I'm, you know, not see anything and miss everything.
[251:03.20]I would have missed that if I got on the horse.
[251:14.62]This game just reminds me when video games were just fucking video games.
[251:17.39]You know what I mean?
[251:18.29]Video games were just allowed to be video games.
[251:19.84]And that was it.
[251:36.35]I love how I've turned for you guys like the Boston accent guy into things that like I'm allowed to kind of come out of my like I can just say whatever I want as that voice that character and it's universally despised anything I say so it's like I don't know it's kind of like kind of relieving and almost like liberating in a way that I can just fucking go like this and say whatever I fucking want and like we all know it's not real and we can all it doesn't matter I can say anything
[252:05.22]I don't know why it has to be, like, the Boston guy with the cigarette outside of a CVS.
[252:10.04]Like, I don't know why it has to be that guy.
[252:15.00]Like, I don't know why that person in my brain has a tank top, a cigarette, short sandals, sitting outside of a CVS with a Gatorade in the other hand.
[252:24.11]And, like, you're walking into the CVS.
[252:27.35]And he's just like, fucking, I don't know why you can't just buy fucking runes with money.
[252:31.46]Like, alright, yeah, alright, man.
[252:33.70]Like, I don't know why that's who I see.
[252:35.06]That's what happens.
[252:35.64]I don't know why that's, that's how I feel about what would happen.
[252:40.11]And you just go, you go into the CVS and then you leave.
[252:42.67]And that guy just kind of shows up everywhere in random places.
[252:47.93]You know, like, that guy, you could be at the deli.
[252:51.35]And he'll just turn around.
[252:53.15]And he still has a cigarette in his hand, by the way.
[252:54.57]And, like, they haven't thrown him out yet.
[252:56.35]And he's just like,
[252:59.87]Man, I wish they were fucking two drive-throughs or three drive-through windows instead of one at like every restaurant All right, dude like Okay It's just like a bot the Boston NPC guy You just you could just say pretty much whatever you want as Boston like GTA character and that's it
[253:33.53]Where am I heading?
[253:34.21]Here, this way.
[253:34.59]Okay.
[253:37.54]Why is the tank top gas station cigarette Boston guy invested in Elden Ring?
[253:42.43]I don't know.
[253:42.85]He just, he's invested in everything.
[253:53.33]And he would always be like... Like, it would always be after he sucks it in, right?
[253:58.01]Like... Hey, what's up, man?
[254:01.86]See the price of Bitcoin?
[254:03.80]Like, he would talk when it was in his lungs.
[254:07.19]And then you'd see it trailing out slow.
[254:10.99]Like, it... That...
[254:13.24]This person just lives in my head completely rent-free.
[254:15.46]He just does.
[254:16.62]Alright, easy, easy, easy.
[254:24.67]Oh, shit.
[254:28.67]You think they should fucking decentralize the CVS?
[254:33.00]It's just like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[254:34.94]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[254:37.00]It's fucking... I think they fucking should.
[254:43.37]I'm not gonna lose those souls.
[254:44.61]Don't worry.
[254:55.14]I gotta be careful.
[254:55.94]I gotta jump though.
[254:56.76]Let's jump.
[255:21.89]I don't even need to fight these things.
[255:23.11]Just move.
[255:24.37]But I will.
[255:24.85]Fuck you, okay?
[255:27.15]Fuck you.
[255:29.59]What is even hitting me that hard that's making that happen?
[255:44.65]Uh... That did a thousand damage.
[255:54.73]It hits more than once.
[255:56.23]Damn, that's crazy.
[255:58.83]Okay.
[256:03.75]And this is the endgame, Peter.
[256:05.71]So it's not like I'm overleveled.
[256:07.29]This is like a 100 to 110 plus zone, isn't it?
[256:10.42]It's just a crazy fucking move.
[256:22.28]Who cares?
[256:40.06]Little weenies!
[256:41.10]Leave me alone!
[256:48.99]Somebody asked why I wasn't using mana before.
[256:51.23]It's because I have the flask of wondrous physique.
[256:55.46]I have a tear in there, which means I consume no FP when I cast spells for about 15 seconds.
[257:14.23]This is not going to close.
[257:15.03]The teeth aren't going to close, right?
[257:17.32]Why do I feel like the mouth is going to close on me?
[257:35.72]That's a Crunchy.
[257:36.44]I'll take it.
[257:36.78]I believe this is a... Yeah, I think I have five now.
[257:41.52]I'll have 13, 14.
[257:43.12]No, don't let that get away.
[257:48.10]Oh, it's just me.
[257:59.67]Alright.
[258:01.03]So, that was not a bonfire.
[258:03.95]I thought it was.
[258:04.68]Wasn't there?
[258:05.08]I feel like I saw one.
[258:07.88]I think it was just a glow from the... Was it just a glow from the mouth?
[258:12.16]Am I crazy?
[258:14.96]Or was there one over here?
[258:20.96]It was the glow from the seed.
[258:22.48]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[258:24.01]Okay.
[258:24.49]Okay.
[258:48.52]Ow!
[259:19.07]Ooh!
[259:20.17]Oh, it's 69K!
[259:33.28]Why does he look like that?
[259:34.58]Because... My parents combined forces and they made this face, okay?
[259:41.42]If you have a problem with it, then I don't know what to tell you.
[259:44.53]sorry sorry that like god mushed his thumbs in like here here here and like here okay I didn't do that you should fix it board
[260:17.64]I didn't even hit anybody!
[260:21.60]Jesus, man.
[260:22.52]Fuck you.
[260:29.85]I think he's gonna run from that shit, huh?
[260:46.02]Alright, we're going traditional.
[260:51.34]Did one of the boys just stagger him?
[260:56.40]Or is that me?
[261:18.67]Jesus, that just did almost 100% of my health bar.
[261:39.51]Jesus Yes, oh that move is good I
[262:09.62]Gargoyle's black blades and black axe.
[262:15.82]Honestly, man, that does a thousand damage if you do the double tap.
[262:20.14]Close.
[262:23.62]That's an unbelievable move.
[262:27.86]The boys actually helped a lot there, too.
[262:33.54]And my axe.
[262:34.98]And my bow.
[262:35.97]And my bow.
[262:36.95]And my bow.
[262:39.40]Wait.
[262:40.12]Keep looking around.
[262:44.91]A lot of you guys said that the boys were going to be a mistake leveling up to plus 10.
[262:49.71]But they've been pretty good.
[262:54.48]They actually have been really good.
[263:05.06]Yeah.
[263:15.81]Yeah, they're really good.
[263:16.75]They're actually... They're annoying to deal with.
[263:19.85]There's a lot of them, too.
[263:20.81]Five people.
[263:21.67]It's kind of just... Sponges, in a way.
[263:33.51]I was getting hit by it for a lot of damage, though.
[263:36.03]That was a lot.
[263:39.13]One swing from that, uh... Almost killed me in one hit.
[263:44.71]So, is this the stage of the FromSoftware games where we all do a ton of damage and we're all just going to kill each other in, like, three hits?
[263:51.47]Two hits?
[263:58.79]I'm down here.
[264:04.13]Looks like I can go down there.
[264:11.48]Yeah.
[264:12.22]Oh my god.
[264:12.88]I have 130,000 souls.
[264:13.60]You're right.
[264:14.36]That'd be a bad idea.
[264:15.02]Let me just check the other side real quick.
[264:38.23]Oh, I thought it was a dungeon.
[264:39.34]Promising.
[264:39.88]Oh well.
[264:43.50]Wait.
[264:46.02]Come on.
[264:48.52]Is that even worth doing?
[265:01.47]I could have just walked in the front door.
[265:11.29]And I missed this cool, like, misty area.
[265:24.59]Ooh, butterflies.
[265:26.21]Lose you very well.
[265:36.46]Looks like Silent Hill.
[265:37.28]It kind of does, doesn't it?
[265:44.87]Shit.
[265:50.15]All right, uh, I said I was gonna alternate between, right?
[266:00.78]Trying to get to 60 intelligence so I can go get the remembrance and get the staff and maybe play around with it.
[266:09.84]What's your favorite Pokemon?
[266:11.48]Um...
[266:20.33]Artivore.
[266:20.71]That's the only one I could think of that was an assist trophy in Smash Bros.
[266:41.68]How come I have to- I can't just be my thing?
[266:44.76]Watch your tone here.
[266:46.18]You're about to get R1'd.
[267:13.32]The one warning I'm gonna give you.
[267:15.72]Okay, so is there a grand lift of rolled?
[267:45.25]Oh shit, there's one right here.
[267:47.25]Mark it.
[267:54.31]Hoist Medallion.
[267:59.83]What medallion?
[268:01.29]Is that the Grand Lift of Dectus Medallion?
[268:14.37]Oh, it's from Morgoth.
[268:15.71]Okay.
[268:18.27]How far am I into the game?
[268:43.40]Uh, I'd say pretty far.
[268:45.00]This is the last zone, I believe, of the game.
[268:47.58]Although I don't know if that's 100% accurate.
[268:52.33]I do know that it is probably the last area that I can walk to.
[268:56.83]I'm getting Pepe left.
[268:58.99]Oh, I guess... Oh, what was that?
[269:01.51]Oh, I guess that's what was happening.
[269:03.39]I guess that's wrong.
[269:16.37]Hit.
[269:47.22]Very cool.
[269:49.36]Very cool.
[269:55.87]I like this area.
[269:57.35]Because it makes me feel like Jon Snow.
[270:07.30]On top of the giants.
[270:19.99]What's with these trees?
[270:23.84]Are these like phantom trees?
[270:26.70]Stop stalling.
[270:28.96]Dude, do I really have to tell you that once in a decade a game like this will come around?
[270:34.04]I'm gonna look around for a sec.
[270:42.37]Mog has the same voice actor as Frog Detective.
[270:45.17]Frog Detective didn't have a voice.
[270:51.74]Oh, wait.
[270:52.06]Yeah, wait.
[270:52.54]I see what you did.
[270:54.28]Scared the shit out of me.
[270:55.08]What happened?
[270:55.48]Can I go down there?
[271:02.45]Is somebody dying?
[271:03.23]I can go... I can do that.
[271:11.56]Let me get the map fragment first.
[271:13.32]It's like right here somewhere, isn't it?
[271:21.80]I'll just hop to the giant's west.
[271:23.88]Oh shit.
[271:39.09]Ruins right here.
[271:44.33]You mog.
[271:53.39]I don't know what that means.
[272:06.36]Oh, hey.
[272:06.92]I remember you.
[272:11.56]Finally, we meet the tarnished.
[272:16.28]Who would be Lord?
[272:17.92]Who am I?
[272:20.73]Why the long face?
[272:22.59]I fear that you were previously acquainted with this vessel.
[272:26.17]Well, that is most unfortunate.
[272:31.60]For he is dead.
[272:33.10]As for his flesh, he gave it to me.
[272:40.40]Shabriri, I hope you
[272:46.55]you were about to sacrifice something precious the life of a fair maiden that you would toss into the fiery forge it died so that you may be lord what a horrible thing to ponder your ascendancy requires her sacrifice whether she wishes it or not but how would the lord crown so he looked upon
[273:16.01]Who the fuck are you?
[273:44.62]And what happened to the guy that came in and helped me?
[273:47.00]It's a different person?
[273:47.72]How did you do that?
[273:48.38]If you inherit the flame of frenzy, your flesh will serve as kindling and the girl...
[274:06.37]Three fingers?
[274:07.77]Two fingers?
[274:09.33]Where's the thumb?
[274:11.05]Where are the thumb cultists?
[274:13.49]May chaos take the world!
[274:37.58]What?
[274:38.18]Deep beneath the capital?
[274:40.80]Who's the faction that just wants to sit on the beach and drink a margarita?
[274:47.67]What is that one?
[275:09.20]What's the faction where it's just like, let's just relax and like, enjoy the sunshine and like, drink some mead.
[275:19.24]I don't... Burn the tree.
[275:21.78]Consult with the two fingers.
[275:23.04]Consult with the thumb.
[275:24.24]Consult with the index finger.
[275:26.98]Consult... Oh, Janus.
[275:28.62]Consult with the big toe of absolution.
[275:37.20]Okay, that was... I guess I...
[275:49.56]Okay.
[275:52.20]I appreciate the help, I guess.
[275:54.98]I'm going to go in these ruins.
[276:03.43]Consult with the middle finger, Tarnished.
[276:08.49]Consult with middle finger, the rude.
[276:10.13]Whoa.
[276:18.51]It's just like...
[276:27.18]What the fuck happened?
[276:28.60]What was that?
[276:31.78]What happened?
[276:34.17]What are you doing?
[276:34.95]Oh no, cold versus cold.
[276:45.89]Good thing I still got the baby rattle, which is MAJOR damage.
[276:52.10]Didn't get you.
[277:25.73]You're losing to a Goomba.
[277:55.13]Dude.
[278:01.64]Alright, there's definitely... There's definitely... Look how you look like a mushroom.
[278:07.36]It's a special hat.
[278:18.41]Looking for a place to go in.
[278:28.25]There's a lot of these, like, spectral animals, right?
[278:31.91]Down in the... The, um... Sea Opera.
[278:35.51]There was all these spectral... Ghost deer and stuff.
[278:40.28]What's the deal with that?
[278:41.82]What's the deal?
[278:42.50]What's going on there?
[278:50.16]Really nothing in here.
[279:02.76]If I'm saying it wrong, it's she... It's Seofra, whatever.
[279:14.38]That's just a regular enemy.
[279:15.44]Holy shit, those guys are crazy.
[279:24.11]Some more ice storm.
[279:25.83]Oh, don't make me just do cold sorcery.
[279:27.87]Alright, these guys, I should not be fighting this many of these guys.
[279:35.34]I gotta find the entrance to this dungeon because it definitely exists.
[279:39.12]Right here.
[279:50.85]Is it a dungeon or no?
[279:52.09]It has to be 73 degrees.
[279:54.01]Yes!
[280:05.40]Smithing Stone... I'm sorry.
[280:09.02]Smithing Stones?
[280:10.04]Miner's Bellbearing III.
[280:15.96]Ooh, that's actually a big deal.
[280:21.14]That's getting old.
[280:21.76]Uh, you should ask my mother... ...um... ...how many times I, like, repeated old cartoon, like, lines over and over again.
[280:35.13]Like hundreds of thousands of fucking times.
[280:37.21]I can't believe.
[280:58.08]Get me out of here!
[280:59.84]Let me out!
[281:09.76]Jeez.
[281:18.53]Okay.
[281:19.67]Can I get out of here now, please?
[281:21.25]What was in that chest?
[281:27.10]Oh, the smithing stone bell bearing guy.
[281:28.14]Okay.
[281:33.64]Why are you Roger from American Dad?
[281:36.97]You mean like the way I look here or the way I look there?
[281:40.33]Like that character or this person here?
[281:42.79]I think that's it for that place.
[281:53.09]I'm going to go over there.
[282:05.80]Holy shit.
[282:06.48]Okay, I'm good.
[282:16.63]I should use the Mog key item.
[282:26.84]Please go to bed for the love of Mog.
[282:27.96]I've been living in this room for like four and a half hours.
[282:29.54]I'm fine.
[282:31.58]Alright, I want to go... Let me go back this way.
[282:36.16]Because I want to go up here.
[282:37.98]Let me check that spell, too.
[282:44.12]It's too... Oh, it is late.
[282:47.76]Let me just... Let me get to like a... Let me get to like five or six hours.
[282:52.53]I need to get... That's so high up.
[282:59.97]How am I going to get up there?
[283:05.94]Check the notes.
[283:06.70]You know what?
[283:08.44]We haven't done that in a long time.
[283:12.12]I wonder what the notes say now.
[283:20.55]Door next to spawn is blocked shut.
[283:25.27]Okay.
[283:25.70]Prawn guy says piss off to me.
[283:28.92]He's at the prawn shack.
[283:34.06]Find Nephile for the potion quest.
[283:36.10]Gold needle from the deep swamp of Scarlet Swamp.
[283:38.90]What?
[283:40.50]These are very outdated.
[283:41.58]These are very old.
[283:43.40]At the very bottom of Lendel, Frenzied Flamelord.
[283:48.24]Oh, that's what that guy was just talking about.
[283:49.72]That's the... He's like, go consult with the Three Fingers.
[284:05.90]Go find Mog.
[284:13.44]Those notes are from an abandoned insane asylum.
[284:26.31]Okay.
[284:32.45]Mog, he is fun.
[284:33.41]I promise you're missing out.
[284:34.89]I'm gonna-
[284:37.13]I don't want to use it and have something happen that's bad.
[284:53.43]My whole body hurts.
[285:04.22]Why are you even attacking me?
[285:10.88]Holy shit, that's much.
[285:12.06]They buffed the hell out of that.
[285:17.15]Yeah, you knocked me all the way down here.
[285:19.89]Annoying.
[285:20.59]I think I can get up there, though.
[285:24.17]Dungeon over here.
[285:27.28]Like, over here somewhere.
[285:30.14]What?
[285:30.86]What?
[285:42.28]Mog waiting room.
[285:43.46]I'm not going to use the Mog item.
[285:45.02]I'm not going to.
[285:47.41]But I will tell you that I am going to turn the stream off shortly.
[285:50.91]Probably in the next 30 minutes.
[285:56.03]Maybe.
[285:56.37]Are you drinking more matcha?
[286:13.22]Yeah.
[286:13.38]Yeah, I am.
[286:18.25]It's just green tea, though.
[286:19.21]It's not... Green tea has not very much caffeine.
[286:25.02]Although, this stuff might have some more.
[286:26.36]It's just green tea, man.
[286:29.68]Don't worry.
[286:32.26]Fucking sages drank this shit like 5,000 years ago every single day.
[286:36.68]Every moment of every day.
[286:37.58]So I'm fine.
[286:38.61]Like 20,000, 30,000 years ago, grands, just sages were drinking this stuff.
[286:50.91]Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking walk off the cliff.
[286:55.32]Don't push me.
[287:16.39]Nothing even up here.
[287:22.59]What is this?
[287:23.19]Mm-hmm.
[287:32.82]Ooh.
[287:39.09]That looks dangerous.
[287:41.68]I'm supposed to cross that?
[287:44.56]Not doing that yet.
[287:49.72]Out of all the people that type auto, you didn't read any of them.
[287:51.82]I talked about auto.
[287:54.12]But then I promised that he was going to be on stream and he's not here.
[287:57.71]Yeah, I did that too.
[288:00.23]He'll show up, don't worry, I promise.
[288:03.41]I'm hungry.
[288:03.85]I wonder what I should eat.
[288:10.52]Can I actually get up there anywhere from here?
[288:15.33]How do I get up here?
[288:29.54]Maybe I can turn around from over here.
[288:34.19]Hey, what's with the lag?
[288:34.87]I thought they fixed that.
[288:39.25]We miss him.
[288:39.93]Don't... I'll show, Otto.
[288:41.81]He's doing good.
[288:42.29]He's doing okay.
[289:00.53]Okay.
[289:06.49]Is that an assassin?
[289:08.13]I still... I... I can't say that fucking word.
[289:29.25]Rires of punishment.
[289:36.64]I gotta see those spells.
[289:38.98]I have to get another flask as well.
[289:42.18]It's a sorcery.
[289:44.02]No, it's not.
[289:45.64]Why is it in the sorceries list?
[289:50.87]Wounds caster to unleash trail of bloodthorns.
[289:53.07]Why is this in the sorcery list?
[289:54.51]If it's no intelligence.
[289:58.73]You have to cast it with a staff.
[290:00.13]That's weird.
[290:05.66]A trail of bloodthorns running over the ground to impale enemies from below.
[290:11.38]An aberrant sorcery discovered by exiled criminals.
[290:14.62]Theirs are the sorceries most reviled by the Academy.
[290:25.65]Wait, I got another one too.
[290:26.43]Where is it?
[290:27.27]This.
[290:28.95]Ice sorcery.
[290:30.37]Strike the ground with a staff to create a freezing tornado.
[290:34.03]Charging enhances potency.
[290:35.33]Cloaked in icy tempests, the knights of Zamor have challenged the fire giants since ancient times.
[290:42.48]Any good?
[290:44.76]I'll try it.
[290:45.12]It's good.
[290:49.26]I'll try it.
[291:04.94]I feel like I don't want to be on the horse face.
[291:21.81]What about Night Comet?
[291:23.03]Let's try it.
[291:40.70]Oh my god, that fucking hurt a lot.
[291:43.62]Alright, let's go.
[292:08.85]You, after dodging that many fucking times.
[292:26.66]Oh my god, dude.
[292:51.09]Jesus.
[292:55.33]That whip is probably available.
[292:56.59]They've added a- I- There's- Seven or eight whips in the game?
[293:04.67]They added way more whips.
[293:06.11]All right, I gotta be careful because this is a potential disaster here.
[293:09.04]I don't think I want to do this on Torrent, but, you know, it's probably what I need to do.
[293:13.22]All right, be careful.
[293:33.58]This is really, really beautiful though.
[293:39.58]Don't go that fast.
[293:40.34]There's no reason to.
[293:41.20]No reason to do that.
[293:53.27]How would you have been a chair out here?
[293:56.39]You're just gonna bring like a chair out here?
[294:09.20]I don't think you want to be sitting.
[294:15.35]He's got a bow and arrow.
[294:22.07]Alright.
[294:23.06]I'm safe right here.
[294:23.96]For now.
[294:24.84]At least for now.
[294:34.84]Oh my god.
[294:56.03]I was trying to dodge through it.
[294:57.17]I was trying to dash through it.
[294:58.11]What's over here?
[294:59.21]A golden rune.
[295:27.30]Alright, I'm fine.
[295:31.68]What are you doing?
[295:32.24]I don't want to get hit by the bow and arrow, man.
[295:34.51]I was trying to be like, we're going to have Ratic so he wouldn't hit me with it.
[295:43.81]I thought he was further back.
[295:46.07]Oh my god.
[295:46.95]Damn it, dude.
[295:47.81]I'm killing this motherfucker right now.
[295:59.35]You're not gonna shoot the literal ground, are you?
[296:25.42]Oh, please!
[296:26.18]You don't have that much gas coming off!
[296:38.31]All right.
[296:42.57]Now I can at least take a look around and see if there's anything I don't want to miss.
[296:51.06]He was standing on something.
[296:52.96]What was it?
[296:55.84]13.
[296:56.98]Cool.
[296:57.28]Okay.
[296:57.56]So was there anything else on the bridge that I missed?
[297:01.74]In my freak out, did I miss anything here?
[297:04.06]I don't think so.
[297:11.13]We're coming up to this Hoslow person.
[297:17.92]And then this... Is that an Erdtree?
[297:19.78]Let's go take a look.
[297:24.48]Alright, I'm... I think it might be time to call it soon here.
[297:30.48]Like, really, really soon.
[297:31.81]Like, next bonfire soon, I think I have to call it.
[297:34.27]It's getting late.
[297:38.29]I just felt like playing and I felt like streaming it.
[297:46.63]This area is really cool though.
[297:47.59]I like this place a lot.
[297:50.69]That's good because I think I actually need one of those.
[298:06.72]Go that way too.
[298:07.52]Oh, let me get that.
[298:10.94]How far down is that?
[298:24.68]I ain't... I ain't going down there.
[298:26.78]Let's head towards 2 and 5.
[298:48.92]Who is up to fight Hoslow?
[298:53.28]Five is that kind of Erdtree looking thing.
[298:56.68]Are you going to show Otto?
[299:00.05]I'll show Otto on the next stream or so.
[299:01.85]I don't know.
[299:02.17]Can you jump to that?
[299:11.55]Maybe.
[299:12.77]I have too many souls to try to find out.
[299:16.79]To that last stream.
[299:18.19]Yeah, but I will.
[299:19.25]I promise.
[299:21.81]You'll see him soon, I promise.
[299:22.75]Alright, there's the bonfire.
[299:30.85]Alright, we're at almost 1230 Pacific.
[299:33.17]We're almost at 3am Eastern, so let's... Alright, alright.
[299:38.57]That's it.
[299:38.81]That's it.
[299:39.33]I'm done.
[299:44.71]That's it.
[299:45.03]I don't want to go to too much longer.
[299:47.81]Uh, tomorrow's Tuesday.
[299:49.05]I wonder if I should stream tomorrow.
[299:54.34]I don't think so.
[299:57.26]I don't think so.
[299:59.26]Tomorrow... I want to say maybe Thursday.
[300:04.12]We'll do, like, Thursday, Friday.
[300:06.98]Tomorrow's Wednesday, technically, yeah.
[300:10.39]But we'll do... Wait.
[300:11.49]Hold on.
[300:12.21]Tomorrow's...
[300:15.40]Tomorrow's Tuesday, which today is Tuesday.
[300:20.09]So we'll go Thursday.
[300:23.25]Thursday, probably Thursday, Friday.
[300:27.05]I might break it up a little bit.
[300:29.67]We probably won't do Elden Ring the whole time, but we will for most of it.
[300:38.29]I might go back and do some DOS stuff.
[300:43.40]I haven't done that in a long time.
[300:45.97]Thursday, 4 o'clock Pacific.
[300:47.63]Friday, 4 o'clock Pacific.
[300:48.99]Same time.
[300:49.35]Same time we usually start.
[300:53.45]This was just kind of impromptu.
[300:55.63]I was supposed to stream tomorrow, which is technically today.
[301:00.48]But I just had the craving.
[301:01.68]I had to play.
[301:02.22]I think we made some pretty good progress.
[301:06.20]I mean, I got pretty far, I think.
[301:11.84]This is...
[301:14.98]Still a lot to do over here.
[301:16.74]And probably even back here, too.
[301:21.38]I also maybe want to go back to the sewer, because he was like, oh, converse with the three fingers.
[301:29.46]Three fingers, two fingers.
[301:33.44]It's a hand, right?
[301:34.90]Like, that makes sense, doesn't it?
[301:39.90]Why would there be two fingers and three fingers?
[301:43.60]Was it the same hand?
[301:44.82]Whose hand is that?
[301:45.88]Why is there two hands?
[301:46.72]Is it more than two hands?
[301:48.90]Does somebody have two hands?
[301:49.94]Like some giant god or something?
[302:00.81]We'll go back to it.
[302:01.77]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[302:02.97]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[302:06.24]Can we do a poll real quick in chat?
[302:12.30]Would you rather break it up on Thursday or break it up on Friday?
[302:16.37]You want Elden Ring on Thursday or Elden Ring on Friday?
[302:19.17]What would you prefer?
[302:25.72]Wait, we have three options.
[302:27.78]Elden Ring Thursday, Elden Ring Friday.
[302:29.98]Wait, do the poll again.
[302:30.98]I'm sorry.
[302:31.30]I'm an idiot.
[302:32.46]Elden Ring Thursday, Elden Ring Friday, or don't break it up.
[302:35.89]Just go, baby.
[302:46.35]What that means is I'm not going to play a different game.
[302:49.37]I'm just going to do this.
[302:54.09]Sorry, mods.
[302:59.41]By the way, if you pick let's go, baby, you're saying that you don't want anything else besides Elden Ring.
[303:13.78]At least for the rest of this week.
[303:17.77]Oh, okay.
[303:18.33]That's a lot.
[303:19.05]That's... 85% of you don't want this to stop.
[303:22.85]Yeah, it's a once-in-a-generation event.
[303:27.38]Whatever.
[303:34.22]I'm getting close.
[303:35.32]I'm getting close.
[303:36.42]I can't promise that I'm gonna... Here's what I do want to do.
[303:40.64]Once the game is completed, once I have nothing else really I really want to do, there's a lot of secrets and a lot of other stuff I haven't explored that I'm not going to do.
[303:49.11]But, I want to do, I want to do like a PvP night.
[303:53.71]Where we have a password on it.
[303:56.60]And we just, kind of like I did with Dark Souls 3.
[303:58.08]Remember, like just there was summoning signs literally everywhere and I was just picking up random people.
[304:06.72]I think that'd be fun.
[304:07.34]We did that before.
[304:08.27]So I imagine one of these streams when I'm done with the game will be PvP slash summoning kind of stuff.
[304:15.73]I think it'd be fun.
[304:22.87]We also need to do a Mii Strong run.
[304:30.58]We'll figure that out too.
[304:31.44]I mean, I am an Elden Ring content creator at this point, right?
[304:35.16]I've been playing this game for a month.
[304:37.91]This game came out a month ago.
[304:40.05]You guys, think about that.
[304:43.56]I have played Elden Ring and Mario Golf in the last month.
[304:57.75]Oh, I did play Picross in Brain Age.
[304:59.07]That's right.
[304:59.39]That's right.
[305:03.55]Alright, I'll see you guys on... See you guys on Thursday for more Elden Ring.
[305:08.77]Let's go.
[305:15.42]Appreciate it.
[305:17.60]Thanks for watching.
[305:20.20]Thanks for the subs, as always.
[305:21.40]I know I don't really read them.
[305:24.72]I don't read any of the sub messages or bit messages or anything, but... I appreciate it.
[305:34.12]One stream a week?
[305:34.98]That's not true.
[305:37.44]Besides the last six or seven days, I've been streaming like four times a week with Elden Ring.
[305:43.26]Before the streamer rewards, I was live like four or five times in a row.
[305:50.18]And this is stream two.
[305:53.07]I'm going to go Thursday, Friday.
[305:54.15]Yeah, this is like four.
[305:55.29]I'm going like four or five times a week with Elden Ring when I'm here.
[306:02.95]Guys, it's a once in a generation event.
[306:13.44]Yeah, take care of yourselves.
[306:14.59]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[306:16.81]Get some sleep.
[306:18.27]Thanks for staying up.
[306:19.51]Hopefully you didn't stay up too late.
[306:21.53]Some of you may have this on right now.
[306:25.43]On an iPad that's right next to you in bed with you.
[306:29.57]Flat on its back.
[306:31.23]Just playing.
[306:33.22]And I'm just still on.
[306:34.62]Hopefully you have a good rest.
[306:37.16]Hopefully you wake up well rested.
[306:40.44]And may health and wealth bless you.
[306:44.90]And may you get the things that you most desire in your personal life.
[306:49.30]And may you continue to move forward.
[306:56.70]I'm doing the cheers to you thing right now.
[307:02.04]I want to thank you.
[307:05.01]You go the extra mile.
[307:10.00]Now, see you guys later.
[307:11.06]Thanks for watching.
[307:12.42]Take care.
[307:12.72]See you Thursday.
[308:06.48]you
[308:41.28]you
