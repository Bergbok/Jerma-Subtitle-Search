[00:09.19]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11.03]Welcome to the Grandpa Christmas Album.
[00:14.21]I want to be the first to welcome you to this selection of fantastic, beautiful songs for the holiday season.
[00:21.54]And we're going to start it off with this one, which is my favorite.
[00:24.36]This is Deck the Halls with Pals and Wally.
[00:29.35]Let me bring my grandson in here for a second.
[00:32.63]Jeremy, come on in here, Jeremy.
[00:35.65]Yeah, you want some?
[00:37.33]Let's do a little bit of a duet here.
[00:57.37]Uh, yeah, sure.
[00:58.03]Okay, here we go.
[00:59.07]So you do the first la, and I'll do the second la.
[01:01.55]What song is this?
[01:03.09]You're gonna do, I'm gonna say fa, you say la, then I say la, we're gonna go back and forth.
[01:07.05]I'm just gonna sing the lyrics.
[01:08.70]Okay, just do it.
[01:10.00]Are we ready?
[01:10.46]Here we go.
[01:11.22]Get ready!
[01:12.00]See the blazing yule before us, fa la la la la, la la la la.
[01:17.22]Strike the harp and join the chorus, fa la la la la, la la la la.
[01:22.65]What are you doing?
[01:24.49]What are you doing?
[01:25.67]How long is this song?
[01:37.28]It's a long song.
[01:38.70]Tis the season to be jolly, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
[01:44.02]Maybe you should have looked up the lyrics of the song before you decided to do it.
[01:48.94]I can't even, it's hard to do this.
[01:49.96]Like, don't do a Christmas album if you don't look up the lyrics.
[01:52.81]I can't do that in song.
[01:55.23]This is still going.
[01:56.85]This song is still going.
[02:00.35]Do you know the rest of the lyrics?
[02:02.48]No, but, you know... I don't know.
[02:05.48]Is it really like three minutes of this bullshit?
[02:08.43]Yeah.
[02:09.27]Okay.
[02:09.95]Whatever.
[02:18.28]Up on the housetop reindeer pause Out steps good old Santa Claus Down through the chimney with lots of toys All for the little one's Christmas joys Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go To the store and get me some free stuff That's what I want, I want some stuff
[02:39.79]You see, boys and girls, Christmas is all about love and respect.
[02:44.73]And giving me, Grandpa, free stuff.
[02:48.03]So give me all the things you got.
[02:49.27]Hold on, hold on.
[02:50.27]Up, whoa, ho.
[02:51.49]Who wanna go?
[02:52.83]Do, do, do.
[02:54.15]Who wanna go?
[02:55.15]Whoa, up on the rooftop.
[02:56.81]Click, click, click.
[02:58.21]Comes old St.
[02:59.17]Nick with my stuff.
[03:01.09]Um, hold on, this is the wrong page.
[03:03.95]Did the...
[03:05.29]I want a new sweater.
[03:06.52]Put that on your list.
[03:28.34]This is where we slow it down a little bit on the album.
[03:32.44]Relax a little bit and here is the Silent Night.
[03:38.43]Silent night.
[03:42.83]Holy night.
[03:47.99]All is calm.
[03:51.75]Everything is bright.
[03:56.57]round yon virgin mother and child holy infant as tender and mild
[04:15.33]Sleep in heavenly peace.
[04:22.85]Peace.
[04:24.74]Sleep.
[04:26.00]Come on.
[04:26.60]Sleep in heavenly peace.
[04:35.82]Silent night.
[04:41.41]Holy night.
[04:44.83]Shepherds quake at the sight Glories stream from heaven afar Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
[05:10.20]Christ the Savior is born.
[05:16.93]On.
[05:18.51]Come on.
[05:19.39]Christ the Savior is born.
[05:26.36]And he is born.
[05:27.24]That's what happened.
[05:37.23]Dashing through the snow In a one horse open sleigh On the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to laugh and sing In a sleighing sound tonight Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way
[06:05.30]Oh, what fun it is to ride inside of my sleigh.
[06:09.06]A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride.
[06:13.03]And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side.
[06:16.35]Who the hell is that?
[06:17.25]The horse was leaning blank.
[06:18.97]Misfortune seemed his lot.
[06:20.99]Well, this is making sense.
[06:22.29]Drifted back and I want to go to store.
[06:24.97]Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[06:29.29]Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
[06:32.73]Hey!
[06:33.23]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
[06:37.32]Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
[06:41.62]Now I want to take a second here to bring up something that's really important to the holiday season and that's given to your local charities.
[06:48.52]Whether it be one dollar, two dollars, ten dollars, anything like the food bank,
[06:54.37]or if your school is having some type of charity drive for toys for younger kids or something, then please do it.
[07:00.80]Because even if you give a dollar, like I said, it's really important to these families.
[07:05.54]So do that.
[07:06.64]If you have the money, then go for it, baby.
[07:09.31]And that's going to end Jingle Bells.
[07:11.37]One, two, three!
[07:16.12]O holy night, the stars are brightly shining.
[07:27.07]It is the day of our dear Savior's birth.
[07:39.51]Long lay the world in sin and error pain.
[07:50.38]Till he appeared and the spirit felt its worth.
[08:01.37]A thrill of hope.
[08:03.72]The weary world rejoices For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angels' voice O night divine, the night when Christ was born O night, O holy night O night divine, O night divine
[08:36.31]Led by the light of faith, serenely beaming With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand All the world is a star so sweetly gleaming I don't know how the song really goes so I'm just improvising I might as well just make up my own lyrics because I can't do this
[09:01.12]And time it takes on by.
[09:09.25]Nothing you can do but cry.
[09:14.72]That was pretty good.
[09:16.28]Somebody write that down.
[09:17.12]That was a good lyric.
[09:18.52]Oh, holy night.
[09:21.96]The stars are brightly shining.
[09:26.73]It is the day of our dear Savior's birth.
[09:40.12]Well, this album is going to come to an end now.
