[00:01.24]God damn it all.
[00:03.14]There's a pyro on that point, fellas.
[00:05.60]Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
[00:06.98]I take care of pyros all the time.
[00:09.81]What's this thing?
[00:22.37]The new exciting game in TF2.
[00:25.40]Watch the saw blades in Sawmill.
[00:29.71]You get one point for every person that walks directly into the sauce.
[00:36.18]There's one point already.
[00:37.56]Ding!
[00:40.29]So I'm just gonna sit here.
[00:41.81]I'm gonna sit here and just record this whole round, start to finish.
[00:45.09]And we're gonna see how many times people die on sawmill to the blades.
[00:48.65]Use the scientific method, roll up your sleeves, get out your safety goggles, because watch out, we're gonna see some type of chemical explosion from this experiment.
[00:56.54]So get your flask ready, get your sodium fluoride ready, we got a lot to talk about here.
[01:00.06]Here we go.
[01:01.60]This is Pyro.
[01:03.04]Same guy.
[01:03.96]Did the same thing.
[01:05.44]That's one.
[01:06.94]There's one.
[01:08.42]I-
[01:14.69]Well, it's two.
[01:17.11]He didn't get his second double jump off in time.
[01:23.24]This is like the most intense game of TF2 ever.
[01:26.32]Just now, red is nearing capture.
[01:31.66]Oh, blue scout.
[01:36.75]That was like a photo finish right there.
[01:38.51]I think that guy got hit by the saw.
[01:40.59]But he just didn't register.
[01:44.68]One of these guys is definitely gonna walk into it.
[01:46.51]I would be shocked.
[01:56.02]See, I told you.
[01:57.66]I wonder if there's a way, like a server mod or something, where you could have those saws go back and forth like a hundred miles per hour.
[02:04.20]Because there would be a hell of a lot more deaths if that was the case.
[02:08.62]Well, Scout.
[02:10.31]He wants the health pack.
[02:11.73]Place your bets.
[02:13.21]Didn't even have time to go to Vegas and place my bet.
[02:17.15]Here's another skirmish.
[02:19.11]When there's like three to four people standing on the point, that's when you start to get the saw blade action.
[02:23.69]Like for instance, right there, I don't know what happened right there.
[02:26.86]I'm not entirely sure what just was happening.
[02:29.38]I think, I think, I don't know.
[02:32.48]He just wanted to go see his friends.
[02:36.48]They have a sentry on here.
[02:37.42]Red, you gotta get that sentry off the point.
[02:39.98]We need more saw deaths.
[02:42.64]It is required.
[02:45.54]It is a requirement.
[02:48.96]We need more sawblade deaths.
[02:51.94]This is not an o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o.
[02:56.54]He just barely caught himself.
[02:59.89]He still might walk into it.
[03:02.47]It's definitely a high possibility at this point.
[03:08.89]Oh, there it is!
[03:14.19]There's another one.
[03:15.29]See ya!
[03:21.45]Oh god, he got launched!
[03:23.55]He got launched!
[03:27.43]If red can hold this, or if blue needs to come take it.
[03:32.33]Otherwise, wow, that was close.
[03:36.43]Oooooh.
[03:38.63]Blue Pyro coming in.
[03:40.27]Bye-bye!
[03:42.43]There's another one!
[03:44.33]Have a wonderful trip to Sawblade Hell.
[03:51.20]Life will find a way.
[03:54.79]Oh, it's Sniper on it.
[04:08.00]No, it's gonna be blue team with a victory, with I don't know how many saw deaths.
[04:12.54]It was at least seven or eight.
[04:16.69]I could seriously sit here all day.
[04:18.85]I could sit here all day and do this, and I probably will.
[04:22.65]Cancel all of my appointments, put everybody on hold, because I don't really want to talk to them.
[04:27.82]I want to watch people walk into sawblades.
[04:29.82]That's like the number one mo- That was almost, that was pretty close.
[04:40.89]Alright, in... Wait, wait till it comes... Wait till it comes back.
[04:46.59]Alright, ready?
[04:47.03]3, 2, 1, go!
[04:53.95]It can't even do it!
[04:59.16]It couldn't even do it, it was getting stuck on people!
[05:04.64]Yeah, how are you doing that?
[05:07.24]You are a master.
[05:08.50]Oh, dude, pile on top of him.
[05:10.36]Somebody try to get on his head.
[05:16.84]Can that work?
[05:17.84]Can that actually be a thing?
[05:18.92]Can you guys, like, ride on top of each other's heads?
[05:26.36]I love everyone trying to attempt to do this.
[05:28.14]This is great.
[05:39.52]It does not seem to be working.
[05:40.92]It does not seem to be working.
[05:42.26]Oh, we gotta get above the waterfall.
[05:48.88]That's key.
[05:49.52]If we can get above the waterfall... Oh, no!
[05:52.80]Oh!
[05:53.42]It's over!
[05:53.74]Oh, who toppled?
[05:54.24]Jenga.
