[00:08.42]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.90]Welcome to Scare Saturdays.
[00:11.62]My name is Jerma.
[00:12.92]Hopefully it's still Saturday.
[00:14.58]I've been having a lot of problems today with rendering and uploading and stuff.
[00:18.79]But if it's not Saturday where you are right now, then I'm sorry about that.
[00:22.23]But anyways, let's go over something first.
[00:23.89]I need a haircut really badly.
[00:26.11]I seriously look like Luke Perry and a mad scientist had a baby.
[00:30.75]And it stars in a new feature film coming this August.
[00:33.35]Now, I look like a friggin' weirdo, but you know what?
[00:35.34]We're gonna leave it.
[00:35.96]It's a Scare Saturdays.
[00:36.88]My hair's already standing up on end because I'm already scared, so it makes perfect sense.
[00:41.52]But anyways, let's get started with Scare Saturdays.
[00:43.26]Welcome back to Scare Saturdays.
[00:44.53]Gonna be playing an Amnesia custom story by the name of Can't Remember.
[00:50.79]Okay, so here we go.
[00:53.07]Can't Remember by Marv Studios.
[00:55.89]You wake up in an unknown house.
[00:57.20]You don't know how you got here.
[00:58.86]You can't see anybody and the only thing you can hear is the rain splashing against the window.
[01:05.42]Alright, so I'm apparently lying on the ground somewhere.
[01:10.73]Your sanity is now dangerously low.
[01:12.35]Make sure to stay in light and try to make progress.
[01:14.25]This is like shaking my screen!
[01:17.19]Cut it out, man!
[01:18.03]Ow!
[01:22.08]Can I turn off, like, the screen shake?
[01:23.76]What the hell, bro?
[01:24.84]Come on, get up.
[01:27.08]Look, just because you had, like, a potty last night and you drank too much, like, tequila, it doesn't mean you can, like, stay on the ground.
[01:32.36]Alright, I'm trying to, like, make jokes, but I'm actually pretty nervous right now.
[01:37.85]Because it's been a while since I've played a game like this.
[01:42.19]Is there a reason why it's all red?
[01:43.29]What the hell's the matter with me?
[01:48.02]Can I go, like, can I just go back to bed and end the video?
[01:50.84]Alright, guys, thanks so much for watching.
[01:52.06]I'm gonna, like, go to bed now.
[01:53.24]Hmm, but this is a mod.
[01:55.96]This is a Amnesia custom story, like I said in the beginning.
[01:58.28]Uh, let's just open up this dresser.
[02:00.78]Apparently my dry cleaning isn't, like, done.
[02:05.52]I gotta, like, bring this to the dry cleaner.
[02:08.85]I really don't want to leave this room.
[02:10.37]I don't want to leave the room.
[02:13.88]Look at how all trippy this is, man.
[02:16.67]Something's going to jump out of this door and it's going to scream in my face.
[02:19.55]Because it's all trippy and it's all weird looking.
[02:21.27]Alright, let's see.
[02:23.57]Is there anything in here I need, by the way?
[02:26.54]What's on the ground?
[02:27.24]Can I get this?
[02:29.68]No, it's just like a bong.
[02:31.70]No wonder the guy's all screwed up.
[02:32.78]He's been smoking like a bunch of weed.
[02:36.73]Mr. Bonin forced me to drink this potion of insanity.
[02:39.43]He said that things who live in this house will kill me, but then they won't harass the people in our village nearby.
[02:47.72]I'm going insane and I will lose my memory, Mr. Bonin said.
[02:50.70]What else should I do?
[02:51.70]Great, so there's monsters in this house.
[02:55.26]God damn it, man.
[02:56.29]Oof.
[02:58.45]Alright, I'm dilly-dallying way too much.
[03:00.07]Let's just go.
[03:02.33]Outside.
[03:03.05]This, like, night is gonna do something weird.
[03:06.21]The mental's been added to the journal.
[03:08.25]Hit M. Explore the house and find a way to get out.
[03:13.24]Easier said than done, okay?
[03:16.66]Please don't, like, come after me.
[03:19.78]God damn it!
[03:25.86]Do I have to just walk down this hall?
[03:27.27]I don't want to go down this hallway!
[03:31.07]Let's go.
[03:31.39]Please don't jump.
[03:34.37]Beware when standing in darkness, your sanity will slowly drain.
[03:36.59]Turn lights on.
[03:38.32]There are no lights around here.
[03:41.38]There are no lights around here, man.
[03:42.90]What's that?
[03:43.32]Can I like break this?
[03:45.88]I have no idea what that is, but I don't think I can go this way yet.
[03:50.96]What about this door that I just opened?
[03:56.28]Where am I?
[03:57.26]Oh, okay, so I can go in here.
[04:00.90]There's a ladder.
[04:02.80]And a couple barrels.
[04:06.47]Is that a lantern?
[04:10.39]No tinder boxes left.
[04:13.59]Should I go up the ladder?
[04:14.65]Can I open this?
[04:16.87]Oh, yeah.
[04:19.16]Got my lantern.
[04:19.86]You picked up a lantern.
[04:20.72]When filled with oil, it can be turned on by pressing F. Oh, yeah.
[04:24.50]I can see.
[04:25.60]I can see clearly now.
[04:27.88]The rain is gone.
[04:29.28]Let's go.
[04:31.68]Uh, just turn the- can I put the damn lantern back on please?
[04:37.98]That's pretty gross.
[04:44.21]Are these like decapitated body parts?
[04:49.03]Look at this cockroach!
[04:51.31]This cockroach is freaking huge!
[04:53.53]Alright, I got a pig.
[04:54.83]Where we going with the pig?
[04:56.87]I'm gonna bring the pig to like dinner.
[05:00.02]I thought that, like, friggin' thing on the right was a monster.
[05:03.01]It's actually just a bunch of leaves.
[05:05.25]Get out of here, pig.
[05:08.73]There's the key to the basement, I'm assuming.
[05:12.09]Picked up the basement's key.
[05:13.26]Let's go, let's go.
[05:14.22]Get me out of here.
[05:14.88]There we go.
[05:19.92]Open.
[05:21.84]Oh, open that basement door, you son of a bitch.
[05:25.05]What the hell was that?
[05:26.05]Am I really going insane?
[05:29.66]I don't know.
[05:32.22]I hope I'm not going insane.
[05:38.38]Oh, the game didn't just crash, did it?
[05:39.86]Oh, we were just getting, like, to the good stuff, probably.
[05:42.80]And the game, like, no, no, I'm good, I'm good.
[05:46.28]Okay.
[05:48.95]Note on the ground.
[05:49.65]If somebody reads this, notice that you have to get out of here.
[05:52.91]The monsters who live here kill everybody who's in the house.
[05:55.43]You have to find some keys or tools to open the doors and the torture chambers.
[06:00.31]One is in a small room in the middle of the basement.
[06:03.67]Maybe you can find some tools in the kitchen.
[06:06.07]The doors are very weak, so you can use a hammer or something like that if you're aware of the monsters.
[06:10.45]Alright, so I gotta break some tools open or something.
[06:13.61]Can I open this thing?
[06:15.11]Let's go.
[06:15.49]Let me get in this, like, trap door.
[06:17.67]Oh, there's a lot of dead people in there.
[06:20.77]Come on, open.
[06:23.91]Come on, you physics engine piece of crap.
[06:26.75]Wow.
[06:28.25]Alright, well, there's a crowbar in here.
[06:29.47]Let me get this crowbar.
[06:32.09]Dave!
[06:37.02]Where am I?
[06:38.62]Pull up the lantern.
[06:39.22]Pull up the lantern.
[06:43.80]Where am I?
[06:44.68]Get me out of this stupid... Get me out of this, like, hellhole.
[06:49.52]Get me out.
[06:50.07]Get me out, please.
[06:50.97]Alright, I'm making, like, a bridge to get out of here.
[06:58.83]Alright, got out.
[07:00.19]Sick.
[07:01.79]That was insane.
[07:03.33]See, I just cut that, but that really took me like 35 minutes to like get... Oh no, I'm out of lamp oil.
[07:15.20]Oh, I'm... Is that a person standing there?
[07:17.80]That's a person standing right there.
[07:20.64]Or is that one of those knights in armor?
[07:22.58]I have no idea.
[07:23.92]Ah!
[07:27.79]The...
[07:29.27]Go this way!
[07:29.89]Go this way!
[07:30.33]Go this way!
[07:30.71]Go this way!
[07:31.05]Go this way!
[07:32.65]This door's locked!
[07:34.03]Oh my god, I have no idea what's going on.
[07:35.63]I don't even know if there's a person here.
[07:37.73]What if I hide over here?
[07:42.42]Oh my god, I don't have any oil.
[07:46.68]What a stupid idiot I am.
[07:48.30]I used all my lamp oil trying to figure out how to put boxes on top of each other.
[07:56.05]It's a monster!
[07:58.21]It's a monster.
[07:59.21]Where do I go?
[08:03.59]It's a monster right fucking behind me.
[08:09.84]I don't have any oil.
[08:10.58]I don't even know where to go.
[08:11.82]I have no idea where to go guys.
[08:14.78]I have no oil.
[08:16.42]I have no lights.
[08:17.10]Can I take the torch from the top of this?
[08:19.78]Holy God.
[08:23.16]I have no idea where this is.
[08:24.04]Am I in the right spot?
[08:25.25]I can't light that.
[08:26.51]Do I have any oil?
[08:27.13]What the hell was that?
[08:31.23]Give me some oil!
[08:31.85]Give me some oil!

[09:04.20]I don't know where to go and I don't know what to do because I spent like 30 friggin' minutes trying to figure out how to put things on top of each other!
[09:20.76]Oh my god.
[09:22.54]Alright, I got back here with lamp oil.
[09:25.41]And I'm ready to try to go actually and do this.
[09:30.63]Yeah, I know he's going to come out.
[09:31.71]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[09:32.59]Is there anything in here I need to get?
[09:36.03]Is there anything in here I need to get?
[09:36.97]That's the real question.
[09:37.81]What do I need to get in here?
[09:39.55]I can't open that.
[09:43.36]Where is he?
[09:43.68]Where is he?
[09:43.98]Where is he?
[09:44.28]Where is he?

[10:39.47]He's not here this time.
[10:40.67]Okay.
[10:42.47]Okay, cool.
[10:43.87]Don't do the lady jumping at me again.
[10:45.72]Alright, she's gone.
[10:47.90]Oh, I don't know how much lamp oil do I have.
[10:53.66]What's that?
[10:54.44]Tinder box.
[10:55.02]Alright, light these.
[10:58.30]Put this away.
[11:00.93]Holy crap, dude.
[11:03.61]Anything here I can take?
[11:06.79]Need, like, oil or something?
[11:08.09]Can I... What's that?
[11:09.39]Screwdriver?
[11:09.95]I don't think I need that.
[11:14.89]Oh, I'm, like, burping.
[11:17.03]Nervous burps.
[11:20.85]These look like some type of tools.
[11:22.99]Ooh, what's that?
[11:24.73]Picked up oil.
[11:27.71]Let's see.
[11:27.99]How much oil do I got?
[11:28.79]I got a decent amount.
[11:30.49]I got a decent amount.
[11:31.35]I can hang for a little bit.
[11:34.77]Crowbar.
[11:35.65]Definitely crowbar the hell out of this wall.
[11:38.55]Nope.
[11:39.01]Can't do that.
[11:41.73]Anything in here?
[11:45.83]Don't think so.
[11:49.31]Anything in here?
[11:52.93]Just take all the boxes out.
[11:53.89]There's got to be something in here for me to like to take.
[11:58.25]Get out of the way.
[12:01.37]Oh, wow.
[12:02.05]That whole encounter was just, like, brain-numbingly horrible.
[12:05.68]Alright, so I gotta find some tools.
[12:07.94]Don't!
[12:08.52]Please don't jump at me!
[12:12.52]Now that that asshole's gone, I can probably... Have it gone in here yet?
[12:17.40]I don't think so.
[12:20.90]What's that?
[12:21.30]A hollow needle.
[12:23.23]Okay.
[12:25.17]Okay.
[12:30.55]I thought that's where I came from.
[12:34.69]This is locked, I guess.
[12:37.29]Maybe not.
[12:38.43]Can I, like, open this?
[12:41.27]Open, you bastard.
[12:46.30]I guess not.
[12:47.04]Maybe it will.
[12:47.64]Maybe I gotta shake it.
[12:48.86]Shake the door open.
[12:50.48]No, I can't go in there.
[12:53.76]Can I pry the door open with the crowbar, maybe?
[12:55.84]Let's try that.
[12:58.42]There we go.
[13:00.03]Let's pry this thing open.
[13:03.05]Did I get it?
[13:04.23]I think I got it.
[13:06.49]Oh, I got it.
[13:07.05]Alright.
[13:08.05]Maybe I didn't.
[13:08.97]Come on.
[13:14.58]Did I open it?
[13:15.14]Yeah, okay, I opened it.
[13:17.32]Okay.
[13:18.80]Rat.
[13:19.80]How much lantern oil?
[13:22.28]Need that lantern oil.
[13:25.51]Tinder box, okay.
[13:26.65]I don't need to use the lantern here.
[13:29.63]Let's go out through this door.
[13:33.05]Can I not go out this one?
[13:34.09]I need another crowbar?
[13:35.15]Are you kidding me?
[13:41.54]Maybe there's something else I can grab.
[13:45.08]Can I pick this up?
[13:47.60]Can I smash this wall?
[13:52.38]Oh, damn!
[13:54.57]Alright, so I just smash through this friggin' wall.
[13:58.72]Alright.
[14:00.44]Oh, do I really want to go down here?
[14:04.12]Can I even get in here is the question.
[14:06.14]Hold on, give me this box.
[14:13.83]What the hell is even... This is bad, man.
[14:16.83]Something's gonna friggin', like a spider's gonna run down this
[14:22.29]Left or right?
[14:23.29]Left or right?
[14:24.09]We're gonna go left.
[14:26.37]Oh, man!
[14:34.37]I knew it!
[14:35.13]I knew it was gonna happen, too, and it still doesn't matter.
[14:39.74]Can I break through this with the hammer?
[14:43.72]What about the needle?
[14:44.40]I'm running out of lamp oil, guys.
[14:47.46]Running out of lamp oil.
[14:49.28]I gotta conserve it.
[14:50.56]I have no idea where I'm going.
[14:53.23]Hmm.
[14:54.77]I need more lamp oil.
[14:56.73]We gotta go right.
[14:57.59]It's gonna happen again.
[14:58.49]Some son of a bitch is gonna pop up right in my face.
[15:03.54]Ladanium.
[15:04.12]Increase your health.
[15:05.14]Okay, it's health potion.
[15:06.76]Need to hold on to this lamp oil.
[15:08.86]It is pitch black, but you know what?
[15:10.48]We gotta make sure we keep that.
[15:13.80]What's that?
[15:14.20]Anything else I can do over here?
[15:17.26]No.
[15:18.56]Okay, well I got like something to break through the rest of that door, I think.
[15:22.82]I don't know how long it's going to take me to rage quit this game.
[15:25.96]I don't think it's going to be very long.
[15:27.90]Because they just keep throwing shit in my face.
[15:31.22]And it's making me want to die.
[15:34.16]Let's open this door.
[15:39.40]Break open.
[15:41.32]Okay.
[15:42.93]Hello, sweetie.
[15:44.91]Any lamp oil in here that I can take?
[15:50.27]No, that's a sanity potion.
[15:54.88]Blood all over the place.
[15:58.64]And a du- huh?
[15:59.96]Huh?
[16:00.36]Huh?
[16:00.84]What?
[16:01.50]What?
[16:02.22]What?
[16:05.14]What?
[16:05.76]Yeah?
[16:06.28]Hi?
[16:07.06]What is this?
[16:08.16]What is all over you?
[16:09.50]No more lamp oil, by the way.
[16:15.83]I can't get out of here either?
[16:19.11]Oh, damn it.
[16:21.93]I need more tools.
[16:24.88]What else is over here?
[16:29.46]Crap.
[16:34.56]Oh, duh.
[16:36.82]What am I thinking?
[16:38.89]I still don't have any lamp oil, though.
[16:41.19]Still... That guy's not moving, though.
[16:46.47]That guy's not moving.
[16:47.23]Is that guy... Is he friendly?
[16:49.05]Can I, like, talk to that guy?
[16:52.34]Hey, don't mind me.
[16:53.10]I'm just, like, in your house.
[16:55.45]I'm just like looking at some stuff.
[16:58.19]Can I pick up the key without you freaking out, man?
[17:02.65]He's right behind me.
[17:06.46]Get this stuff out of the way.
[17:07.90]Get out of the way.
[17:08.50]Get out of the way.
[17:08.96]Get out of the way.
[17:09.98]Open the key and go!
[17:14.98]I have to take the- Wait, what did that say?
[17:23.27]Jesus.
[17:25.16]Floating like specters.
[17:29.70]Where's the... I need lamp oil.
[17:31.54]Give it to me.
[17:32.48]Where the hell are we?
[17:36.70]I don't... What is that?
[17:37.78]Get out of my way.
[17:39.98]We're in water now.
[17:41.48]Get out of the way.
[17:46.09]I thought that was another lantern.
[17:47.23]I thought there was another person down here.
[17:50.39]Holy... Get me on top of something.
[17:54.06]Get me out of the water.
[17:54.82]Get me out of the water.
[17:55.46]Get me out of the water.
[17:56.08]Get me out of the freaking water.
[18:01.85]Are you serious, dude?
[18:03.07]What the hell am I supposed to do here?
[18:04.39]Alright.
[18:07.47]We're going to run for it.
[18:08.79]Go.
[18:16.83]Run for it.
[18:17.37]Run for it.
[18:18.09]Get out of the water.
[18:21.63]Holy crap.
[18:27.66]And the bitch is laughing at me now.
[18:31.67]Get me.
[18:32.05]Get me on top!
[18:36.31]Get me on top!
[18:37.53]Get me!
[18:38.37]Get me!
[18:39.55]Get up!
[18:40.09]Get up here!
[18:40.85]Get up here!
[18:42.05]Get up here!
[18:42.95]Holy Lord in heaven, find me out of this little area, please!
[18:49.45]Is that a door?
[18:53.00]It's a door.
[18:54.54]Oh, there's a key in here.
[18:59.21]Damn it!
[19:00.93]I can make the jumps.
[19:01.71]Just gonna make the jumps.
[19:02.55]Just don't be such a psycho.
[19:04.01]Just make the jumps, and you'll be good to go.
[19:09.60]Okay, where's the key?
[19:11.32]Where's the goddamn key?
[19:12.70]Ooh, what's that?
[19:14.24]I don't know, but I'm jumping over to it.
[19:17.15]I think these are... tinder boxes.
[19:19.87]Okay, nice.
[19:22.05]Maybe I can light a frickin' candle now.
[19:28.08]Is that a key?
[19:28.62]I can't tell.
[19:29.34]Yeah, there's the key.
[19:31.14]Okay.
[19:32.58]A gun.
[19:35.00]Wherever that door was, I don't even know where I am, but I think it was over here.
[19:39.16]Yep, it's right here.
[19:39.86]Let's get the hell out of this friggin' swamp land.
[19:48.91]Yes, I did it.
[19:49.53]Walking the last few stairs to get outside.
[19:52.07]Did I beat the game?
[19:54.77]I beat the game.
[19:55.23]What the hell is that?
[20:00.57]I need to light something.
[20:01.43]I have Tinder, but I... Give me some oil so I can get the f*** out of here.
[20:09.56]Thank God.
[20:10.42]Lamp oil.
[20:11.74]Save my life.
[20:14.64]Thank bejesus.
[20:18.28]Hopefully that's not, like, my friend.
[20:23.66]I'm dying.
[20:24.26]A monster hurts me.
[20:25.50]Run to the little house in the forest and call the police.
[20:28.78]I think I won't survive, but I hope you do.
[20:30.80]Take the potion in front of the door to blow it up.
[20:35.04]So I blow the door up?
[20:44.45]What?
[20:45.37]What?
[20:47.17]What the fuck was that?
[20:48.43]Is that guy still in here?
[20:52.94]Is that guy still in here?
[20:53.94]Is that guy still in here?
[20:54.70]Just run!
[20:56.58]Just call the police!
[20:57.72]Call the police!
[20:58.44]Call the police!
[21:01.12]Call the police!
[21:01.90]Call the police!
[21:04.16]911, what is your emergency?
[21:05.14]Yes, hi, my name's Jerma, and there is a bunch of people running after me, and I'm trying to get to the house, and I'm trying to call the police so you can come and save me.
[21:14.25]Oh, that was a good guy.
[21:15.21]That ghost was.
[21:17.57]You called the police, and they burned the house.
[21:20.07]You survived.
[21:21.77]Alright.
[21:27.94]Alright, I don't know what the hell that was that came out of the door, but it wasn't there anymore.
[21:32.98]Anyways, this has been Amnesia Custom Story.
[21:36.22]The name of the custom story has been... I, like, forget because I'm so, like, jumbled.
[21:40.56]Can't Remember is the name of this custom story.
[21:44.33]Pretty intense, pretty ridiculous, but I beat the whole thing in one playthrough, so cool.
[21:48.61]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[21:50.05]Thank you so much for watching, and of course, take care, everybody.
