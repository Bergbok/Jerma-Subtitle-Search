[00:08.66]Cute Bot version number 2.652 is on the loose.
[00:12.84]Cute Bot is only here to look cute.
[00:15.34]Does anyone need anything?
[00:16.98]Can I get you a drink or maybe some potato salad?
[00:23.57]So this is RD Asteroid, and as you can see here, we've got plenty of different classes to choose from.
[00:30.67]We've got plenty of demo men, we've got a lot of soldiers, we've got a lot of heavies.
[00:36.52]There's not just scouts and engineers, there's way more.
[00:42.94]What are we doing?!
[00:44.86]We need to be killing the robots!
[00:48.10]Don't pan the engineer!
[00:51.16]That's not what we should be doing.
[00:53.64]Look, I'm just... We have to go get the... Oh, there's an engineer over here.
[00:58.60]Oh, great.
[00:59.48]There's a... Okay.
[01:02.00]These two sentries are so close to each other, I'm surprised that, like, they're not, like, gonna be shooting at each other.
[01:06.09]I got auto-balanced.
[01:11.18]Some say the scout and engineer battle on R.D.
[01:13.82]Asteroid lasted a quarter century.
[01:17.64]And I'm here to tell you that you're dead true.
[01:20.74]For there's an endless supply of bonk atomic punch in space, making this battle rage forever.
[01:28.41]Who will reign supreme in the bonk to get the battery?
[01:32.65]I wonder.
[01:34.09]Hopefully we will soon see the outcome.
[01:38.91]Don't forget your bonk!
[01:40.07]Don't forget your bonk!
[01:40.93]Don't forget your bonk!
[01:45.67]Oh, it's closing!
[01:46.61]The door's closing!
[01:47.41]No!
[01:48.51]I wanted to get in there!
[01:52.49]Don't you laugh at me!
[01:55.82]Oh, shit!
[01:58.48]Oh, god!
[01:59.44]This guy!
[02:00.34]No!
[02:00.48]Oh, what?
[02:11.05]How am I dominating somebody?
[02:13.61]Hold on.
[02:14.05]Hold on.
[02:14.45]Hold on.
[02:14.77]Hold on.
[02:15.15]Hold on.
[02:15.63]One second.
[02:16.37]Give one second here.
[02:17.43]What?
[02:18.83]What the flying fuck is going on right here?
[02:24.96]What is... What is this?
[02:26.48]I don't know why this guy's behind the glass.
[02:31.52]Too many centuries versus a big... Alright.
[02:34.08]Here we go.
[02:34.48]This is the real test.
[02:36.77]Of what's a better sentry?
[02:38.43]Who's like the better engineer?
[02:40.27]Two big sentries versus two minis.
[02:44.35]Blocked by glass.
[02:50.02]Oh my god.
[03:01.78]Oh boy.
[03:04.35]What do we got?
[03:04.79]What do we got?
[03:05.25]What do we got?
[03:05.75]What do we got?
[03:06.95]Oh, look, a spy.
[03:07.63]I'm gonna go steal your R2-D2.
[03:10.53]You can try.
[03:12.38]Stealth, are you on the other team?
[03:14.36]I'm on blue.
[03:14.80]Oh, well.
[03:18.06]I'm just making my way through.
[03:20.02]Okay, I'm joining red.
[03:21.00]I'm on red.
[03:22.98]Just sneak by here.
[03:23.96]Go by the hole.
[03:26.11]Anybody?
[03:26.55]Oh, look, a soldier.
[03:27.45]You might be AFK.
[03:28.55]Oh, no, you're not.
[03:30.95]He wasn't AFK when I shot him.
[03:33.98]Oh, now I'm at their R2-D2s.
[03:37.06]I can't do it.
[03:37.62]I... I can't.
[03:39.34]I just can't shoot R2-D2.
[03:40.15]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:44.33]Whoa.
[03:45.17]I'm gonna get the intelligence.
[03:46.87]Come on!
[03:48.29]Come on!
[03:50.13]Oh, my God!
[03:51.55]Tom Hanks.
[03:52.19]I mean, Tom Cruise.
[03:53.01]Fuck.
[03:57.97]What are we gonna do?
[03:58.67]We need to play as Betzer.
[03:59.97]Who's gonna, like, actually not make it through this, do you think?
[04:02.70]Oh, this thing is simple.
[04:10.19]This thing is simple, huh?
[04:14.44]Okay, now can you accept this?
[04:18.12]What am I doing?
[04:19.32]Can you accept that backflip?
[04:22.80]I need to step back a little bit.
[04:25.06]It'd be really funny if you could get killed by that.
[04:28.26]Oh, that's gonna be close.
[04:32.78]Alright, right here.
[04:35.90]What the fuck just happened?
[04:39.06]I definitely got killed by the laser.
[04:41.49]Oh, this is so stupid.
[04:44.85]I hope everybody makes it through.
[05:10.07]So come to where, like, everybody is on A. For, like, blue?
[05:15.06]On, like, where we are.
[05:17.40]Okay, on red?
[05:18.64]Mm-hmm.
[05:21.28]All right, let me come to the front door.
[05:29.39]I'm gonna get... I'm going to make this guy do a backflip.
[05:32.63]And once we're after... Right when he's done... Right when...
[05:43.42]Why did it take that guy that long to decide to do that?
[05:46.85]Everyone's just kind of standing around.
[05:52.11]There's like no objective for us to do right now.
[05:57.49]Besides just like standing around.
[05:59.44]There's one, two, three, four, five, there's six people on our team.
[06:02.30]Seven people.
[06:03.84]Just chilling out right here.
[06:05.16]Maybe we'll steal more points.
[06:10.48]You got it.
[06:11.39]Congratulations.
[06:14.22]Oh shit, a player!
[06:16.67]A guy on blue team!
[06:17.87]Look out!
[06:19.13]Don't worry, there was only one of them.
[06:21.25]There's ten people on their team.
[06:24.22]We did it!
