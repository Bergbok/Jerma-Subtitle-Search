[03:59.71]The fuck?
[04:00.55]My turret.
[04:01.79]That is the best shit I've ever seen.
[04:09.64]That's not going to be good.
[04:10.48]I don't know what all my options are.
[04:12.30]You're going to kill yourself.
[04:14.96]Yeah, he doesn't have any time.
[04:16.68]Oh, shit.

[04:20.65]Oh, my God.
[04:21.63]Oh, my.
[04:21.99]I don't know what's going on here.
[04:23.49]You have to detonate it.
[04:25.05]I think you have to detonate that.
[04:27.27]Oh.
[04:31.22]Oh, shit.
[04:32.60]Oh, shit.
[04:34.28]Why did I tell him that?
[04:35.94]I should have left him in the dark.
[04:40.86]Well, I'm going to lose this match.
[04:43.64]I think I'm going to win, actually.
[04:44.80]I think it's still against Orbeez here.
[04:45.94]I'm sorry, Jerem.
[04:50.77]Alright.
[04:51.37]You know who to shoot at here, Jerem.
[04:52.73]Yeah, I know.
[04:54.51]I know what I'm doing.
[04:56.57]I know exactly what I'm doing right now.
[04:59.95]No, what are you doing?
[05:01.14]Oh, shit.
[05:01.64]Oh, shit.
[05:10.17]I just killed myself.
[05:16.17]Was that a cluster bomb?
[05:17.37]It was a cluster bomb, but I'm an idiot and I threw it incorrectly.
[05:21.78]I will get to you eventually, Shibby.
[05:23.74]No.
[05:25.48]I will get to you.
[05:26.58]Nice NOSC, brah.
[05:30.37]Oh, wow!
[05:32.15]Wow, that was a perfect shot!
[05:34.45]That aim, though.
[05:35.54]That aim... How did you get that right... I don't know how you did that.
[05:40.56]That is FPS aim right there, fellas.
[05:43.82]Can I call upon, like, the power of the rats in the background to come, like, eat your faces?
[05:46.98]No!
[05:48.60]That would've been so funny if you'd fell down.
[05:50.75]Well, funny because you would've died.
[05:52.45]You probably really would've.
[05:53.51]It's been funny because you would've died.
[05:55.91]It sounds so horrible.
[05:57.11]Jump rope.
[05:57.85]Oh, only a minute and 46 seconds.
[06:01.77]Oh, you fuuuu... MLG grandpa doesn't care.
[06:07.85]Hey, Orb's gonna win by default.
[06:10.62]Only a minute and fifteen seconds left, so... God damn it.
[06:13.54]You gotta do more damage to him, Jerm.
[06:14.84]I can't... I... Oh, no.
[06:16.86]Oh, shit.
[06:17.54]No, you have to jump.
[06:19.63]Yes!
[06:20.01]Yes!
[06:20.31]Get it!
[06:20.69]Get it!
[06:21.03]Get it!
[06:21.77]Yes!
[06:22.31]Yes!
[06:23.13]Fuck!
[06:24.53]Alright, here we go.
[06:25.33]We got a game.
[06:28.65]Get out.
[06:30.46]It was worthless.
[06:31.88]We are never playing this again.
[06:34.16]Raise us the water level.
[06:35.16]Alright, so it keeps going.
[06:37.10]I didn't mess up that.
[06:39.04]Go, go, go.
[06:41.27]This is going to be it right here.
[06:43.03]Unless the orb screws it up.
[06:44.79]Hold on, I got this.
[06:47.39]I'm just going to...
[06:51.32]Oh, yes!
[06:52.14]Yes!
[06:52.82]Yes!
[06:56.12]Oh, you're so boned.
[06:58.92]Oh, you're so boned.
[07:00.41]Oh, dude.
[07:01.91]If you draw, no.
[07:03.25]Oh, no.
[07:04.57]Seriously.
[07:05.05]Seriously.
[07:05.95]That's no way.
[07:07.15]The game is glitched.
[07:08.09]Rick, tweet somebody.
[07:12.27]Oh, no.
[07:13.99]No way.
[07:14.77]No way.
[07:16.55]Where's my cursor?
[07:18.35]I cannot lose this.
[07:19.41]I cannot lose this.
[07:20.73]I cannot.
[07:21.41]Where's my cursor?
[07:22.49]I'm waiting for players right now.
[07:24.37]I'm trying to select my move.
[07:27.28]Where's my move?
[07:30.32]Seriously, Shibby.
[07:31.00]This is gonna be it.
[07:32.86]I think you're gonna both bounce back into the water.
[07:34.54]It might not, though.
[07:35.40]The explosion's not that powerful.
[07:37.74]My god, oh Yes, oh, thank you, I can't believe it oh
