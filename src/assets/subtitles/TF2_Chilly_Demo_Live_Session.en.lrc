[00:05.39]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:07.05]Jerma here with some live Dermalicians Man gameplay commentary.
[00:11.47]Tonight I'm going to be playing with the new items, the new demo items.
[00:16.03]Because, you know, I haven't really had a chance to sit down with them consecutively.
[00:19.72]So, let's go.
[00:23.52]So I have to try to like figure out how this stuff works.
[00:26.14]It's been a week or so since I've played Team Fortress 2.
[00:31.60]But we're going to give it a go.
[00:33.84]When I first saw this sticky launcher, I was under the impression that I was probably going to like it.
[00:39.22]Because you just shoot stuff and explode.
[00:41.90]Shoot stuff and explode.
[00:43.68]Is that spy dead?
[00:44.59]I have no idea.
[00:45.93]Does anybody know if that spy is dead?
[00:48.45]Can I please hit...
[00:50.97]You want to go ham on ham?
[00:53.09]You want to go ham on ham?
[00:53.91]It was a big mistake.
[00:56.02]You never go ham on ham with a demo.
[00:58.64]Oh, you were a demo, so never mind.
[01:00.40]You are a spy.
[01:01.64]If I've ever seen one, you are a goddamn spy.
[01:07.95]No, he wasn't.
[01:09.73]He was a regular player.
[01:12.43]Look at you!
[01:16.04]Oh no, we can't lose.
[01:18.04]No, you fucker!
[01:20.08]Oh, I saw that happening too.
[01:23.21]I legit just watched that happen and didn't do anything about it.
[01:26.73]I just kind of, my brain turned off.
[01:28.23]And he's gonna get to the point here with crits.
[01:31.35]Somebody do something about that.
[01:33.85]Oh, good job.
[01:34.39]Good job Pyro.
[01:35.62]You flamed him.
[01:37.08]Nice job flaming him.
[01:39.20]Now we lose.
[01:40.42]That guy charged on it and we lose.
[01:43.05]Alright, let's just restock the video.
[01:45.21]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[01:46.61]So you're probably wondering why we're on cold front.
[01:51.68]And the answer to that is quite simple.
[01:54.14]It's really, really cold right now in the northeast.
[01:55.94]There's like a big cold front passing through.
[02:00.52]And I figured why not show the implication that it's chilly out.
[02:04.10]And it's like five degrees outside.
[02:06.31]And I'm sure a lot of you guys from really cold areas are probably like, wow, that's nothing.
[02:10.43]You're telling me you're, like, you're gonna close schools for, like, 5 degree weather?
[02:14.71]I walked a school in, like, negative 15!
[02:16.17]What does this guy think he's doing?
[02:20.11]Oh, I didn't get anybody.
[02:22.13]I'm gonna wrap around.
[02:24.11]I still don't understand this item.
[02:26.29]This item is, like, what, a combination of the lock and load?
[02:29.05]Should I be treating it like a lock and load, or what?
[02:30.77]It's, like, lock and load in the default.
[02:32.35]Kind of, as one.
[02:33.21]I'm not even entirely sure how I should be playing with this.
[02:37.21]But all I know is it's good for stuff like that, because it travels really far.
[02:42.06]And that's what you should be using it for, at least in my opinion, is to launch stuff really far very quickly.
[02:48.32]Well, let's try to get this capped.
[02:49.42]Hey!
[02:49.78]Hey!
[02:50.14]That's two spies.
[02:50.70]No, it's not.
[02:51.06]It's just one.
[02:51.44]Where'd you go?
[02:54.18]Show yourself.
[02:55.96]Give me this health.
[02:56.92]I don't feel like dying right now.
[03:00.03]Is he dead?
[03:01.01]Alright, he's dead.
[03:01.37]We're gonna get this.
[03:03.27]These rounds are going super, super fast.
[03:07.71]But yeah, I mean, direct shotting with this thing?
[03:10.19]Is it as fast as the lock and load?
[03:12.19]I just don't even know.
[03:13.89]What the hell do I even know?
[03:16.63]Got that guy.
[03:18.91]The one thing I don't like about this new sticky launcher is the... The point... The point.
[03:23.08]The thing.
[03:24.28]Can you... Say words!
[03:26.02]Say words!
[03:27.50]It's not that difficult to produce vocabulary.
[03:31.06]Do we have a medic?
[03:34.00]I don't even know.
[03:35.62]Is the short detonation time...
[03:37.52]I don't like that.
[03:39.22]But I guess you kind of have to give up the fact that you're able to shoot things across the map in like less than two seconds like that.
[03:45.85]So we're gonna wait for this health to spawn.
[03:47.15]Please spawn.
[03:48.09]And you are... I'm sorry.
[03:50.09]I'm really sorry about that.
[03:51.53]You could have used that health.
[03:53.55]Instead, I took it from you.
[03:55.31]Do we... Are there this many snipers on the team?
[03:57.31]Or is that like a spy or something?
[04:00.95]Get rid of that thing.
[04:02.27]Where's the medic?
[04:04.74]There's too many snipers.
[04:05.66]I keep thinking you're all spies.
[04:13.02]One more hit.
[04:13.88]Oh, I would have had him.
[04:15.51]Still got him.
[04:16.01]I'm good.
[04:16.55]It's good to go.
[04:18.91]Good to go.
[04:19.41]Good to go.
[04:19.81]Good to go.
[04:20.79]Not really.
[04:21.37]Here comes everybody.
[04:22.21]I should really pull this out.
[04:25.99]There we go.
[04:27.21]Oh, I just barely didn't get that guy with the long range shot.
[04:31.43]Come here, medic.
[04:33.97]Holy shit.
[04:34.82]Get me out of there.
[04:36.56]Let's recharge.
[04:39.06]We need some health.
[04:40.78]Give us the health.
[04:42.58]Ooh, damn!
[04:44.56]Was that a crit screen, or did he just get a random crit?
[04:48.50]Shit!
[04:50.06]I wanted to win the video game!
[04:54.06]They got it, damn it!
[04:55.93]Alright, I gotta... I gotta, like, sit up in my chair.
[04:59.41]Let's sit up in the chair.
[05:00.97]Let's take a sip of our crystal clear... That guy just lost an Uber.
[05:05.65]Shit.
[05:07.05]That's no good.
[05:09.07]Can I stick... I can sticky jump.
[05:10.21]Yeah, I think so, right?
[05:11.33]Yeah.
[05:12.73]Whee!
[05:14.99]That's a sniper that's going for my... You know what?
[05:16.55]Screw it.
[05:16.88]I'm gonna use this thing.
[05:18.90]I like this thing more than the... Holy shit!
[05:20.84]Did he really just launch that across everything and hit me?
[05:24.62]Damn it!
[05:26.00]Now they're gonna cap it.
[05:28.00]No.
[05:30.29]I didn't... And you know what?
[05:30.95]I didn't even sit up in the chair.
[05:33.11]That's problem number one.
[05:34.59]I'm still, like, slouching back like a fucking sloth.
[05:39.67]There we go.
[05:40.17]Now we're sitting up.
[05:42.04]We're just gonna go for this.
[05:43.06]Let's see if we can get somebody right now.
[05:44.60]See if that just hit somebody.
[05:46.58]It did.
[05:46.84]That's too bad that that didn't kill somebody.
[05:51.54]That would have been pretty funny.
[05:54.83]Oh, pop it.
[05:55.39]He popped it.
[05:56.13]He didn't drop it.
[05:57.81]That's too bad.
[06:00.39]And I'm still taking damage at 1 HP.
[06:04.51]Spirit of Halloween?
[06:06.37]No!
[06:09.05]We're in the middle of January!
[06:12.12]It's like, what is this?
[06:14.52]Halloween only comes once a year, and I would accept Halloween anywhere between late September to early November.
[06:21.66]But in January, that's pushing it.
[06:24.71]And I need health.
[06:25.79]We're getting just swarmed right now.
[06:27.03]Oh my god, I'm using this thing like a shotgun.
[06:34.13]If I could just hit this medic, that would be fantastic.
[06:37.40]Fantastic.
[06:39.38]But I can't.
[06:41.58]Actually, maybe I can... I'll just babysit up here.
[06:43.64]At least for now, until I can get some health.
[06:46.79]There we go.
[06:47.45]Did the spirit of Halloween go through?
[06:51.53]I just saw a candy pumpkin.
[06:54.05]That was a candy pumpkin.
[06:56.21]Oh my god.
[06:59.82]You're no longer among the living.
[07:04.28]Get over here.
[07:06.66]Where the fuck did you come from?! !
[07:12.01]Ooh, I got a winter crate!
[07:13.85]I gotta do some shit.
[07:16.75]I'm not doing so well right now.
[07:22.02]I'm gonna arc these differently, I think.
[07:25.80]Sort of.
[07:27.94]You're not getting away with that.
[07:30.58]Damn it!
[07:33.00]Come on up here.
[07:35.18]Come on up here.
[07:38.50]No!
[07:38.60]Get away with me with that shit!
[07:44.38]There's a lot of people coming down there.
[07:46.91]I need some health.
[07:49.63]Give me the heals.
[07:52.97]No, not quite.
[07:53.99]Not quite through the hall.
[07:55.81]But there are a bunch of people in here now.
[07:59.18]Especially that spy.
[07:59.84]I don't want that spy to wrap around.
[08:03.76]Yeah, there he is.
[08:04.84]Where's he going?
[08:06.78]Where is he?
[08:07.12]Right there?
[08:08.96]Get out of here.
[08:10.29]Get out of...
[08:13.10]Damn it!
[08:13.40]Come on, we gotta spawn.
[08:16.10]We can't lose right here!
[08:18.70]What's going on?
[08:19.24]We having like a fucking tea potty and spawn, guys?
[08:21.30]Let's go!
[08:21.94]And there's a spy that just opened this door.
[08:27.21]Because the invisible man.
[08:29.81]Nobody can open doors like that.
[08:32.33]Unless... Holy shit.
[08:33.59]What do we got here?
[08:36.97]You.
[08:38.71]That's a crit.
[08:39.15]Come on, hit somebody.
[08:41.31]That didn't hit anybody?
[08:42.31]There was like three people just standing here.
[08:46.41]I'm gonna wrap around this way.
[08:48.89]Well, I got the medic.
[08:51.07]Of all people to get.
[08:52.61]Oh, damn it.
[08:53.63]You're gonna run right into me, aren't you?
[08:55.79]You didn't think that spy was gonna get you.
[08:57.79]I hit him with two.
[09:01.13]Can I hit him with that?
[09:03.11]I'm just gonna go for the sniper instead.
[09:05.17]Screw that guy.
[09:07.31]Sniper won't even know I'm gonna do this, because I can shoot at super long range.
[09:12.06]Good thing I detonated before it even got to anybody.
[09:14.40]Holy shit, bye.
[09:15.44]I didn't even kill him either.
[09:20.18]I did not even kill him.
[09:21.94]But I will take credit for it nonetheless.
[09:27.04]Damn it, I'm so bad with that thing.
[09:30.92]Anybody?
[09:31.32]No, nobody on it.
[09:32.20]They're all over here.
[09:33.98]You know what?
[09:34.30]There's definitely a sniper here.
[09:35.53]Yeah, of course there is.
[09:38.68]Can't even hit a guy standing still with this thing.
[09:41.32]Can't even hit a guy standing still.
[09:44.49]Goodness.
[09:46.99]Okay, well, sort of made up for it.
[09:49.03]Sort of.
[09:51.59]You need a medic, don't you?
[09:53.59]What?
[09:54.79]What?
[09:56.51]What?
[09:56.73]It's okay.
[10:00.24]I will take this medic, and maybe we can push in.
[10:02.78]That would be great.
[10:05.54]That would be fantastic if we could just push in right now.
[10:10.88]Oh, don't let him get over on that health.
[10:14.36]You've got to cover all your bases when there's a health there.
[10:16.13]You've got to put one here, you've got to put one there, you've got to put one over there.
[10:21.05]This is not good.
[10:23.37]Okay, well, we've got a team.
[10:24.85]Whoa, somebody's going to cap it.
[10:27.74]Somebody was just about to cap it on our team.
[10:32.48]And we've got a Kritskrieg.
[10:34.24]Ooh, a Kritskrieg.
[10:35.50]I bet you if you use it, we win.
[10:39.12]I betcha we win.
[10:43.88]Oh my god!
[10:45.97]I got two people.
[10:48.71]Perfect timing for me to be good at the game.
[10:53.53]What's happening?
[10:54.07]Just, you know what, screw it.
[10:54.77]I'm going for it.
[10:57.79]Ah!
[11:00.07]I made up for it.
[11:01.77]I made up for my two-kill crit screen.
[11:03.77]I did the sticky jump over and got the point.
[11:07.89]I did it.
[11:10.62]I just heard a spy decloak.
[11:12.80]Is that you?
[11:14.28]That was you.
[11:15.60]That was you!
[11:18.14]That absen- I got him!
[11:18.98]Okay.
[11:20.62]Well, okay.
[11:22.19]So, got a spy.
[11:24.31]Got ourselves a spy there.
[11:27.01]They're flooding the point right now.
[11:28.87]Ooh, don't stop and drink!
[11:33.39]Don't stop and drink your fluids!
[11:35.66]Your Gatorade or your Powerade!
[11:37.58]Whatever the hell you were just drinking!
[11:41.05]Dear!
[11:43.91]Nobody there?
[11:44.37]Nobody there.
[11:45.33]How are our sentries doing?
[11:47.53]Good?
[11:48.39]Alright.
[11:49.33]Well, we only have to push through four points.
[11:52.71]Or not lose it.
[11:53.85]Oh, there we go, there we go.
[11:56.00]Thanks for the speed boost, dude.
[11:58.38]We're actually gonna push out.
[12:00.10]Would you look at that?
[12:01.76]Here comes a scout.
[12:04.32]I thought he was gonna open the door.
[12:07.10]He kinda isn't gonna open the door, is he?
[12:09.99]This is what we're talking about here.
[12:10.94]What we're talking about like long red is a crit.
[12:13.48]Was that a crit?
[12:14.88]How am I not hitting anybody?
[12:17.36]I can't hit the backside of a fucking barn door.
[12:24.32]Oh, that's a lot of damage.
[12:25.50]At least I got somebody.
[12:27.75]Hopefully it was the heavy.
[12:30.03]If it wasn't the heavy, then... No.
[12:33.07]Spy!
[12:34.45]Where is he?
[12:35.55]Watch out for the spy.
[12:36.17]Okay.
[12:37.90]Dude, no, I gotta wait here.
[12:39.66]Because there's no way I can let that happen.
[12:41.86]Because he will come over here and just zap this thing.
[12:46.84]I gotta give this guy a little bit of protection, at least.
[12:49.94]At the very least.
[12:52.42]No, you're real.
[12:54.14]There's a sniper.
[12:55.96]Sniper down.
[12:56.50]That's a lot of people.
[13:02.33]Oh.
[13:04.87]No, I got him.
[13:06.48]Alright, let's push out.
[13:07.28]Push out, boys.
[13:09.00]We got places to be.
[13:10.04]Guy's on the right.
[13:15.72]Oh, he's still alive.
[13:16.46]There he goes.
[13:18.41]What about this guy?
[13:19.83]Long range.
[13:21.87]Oof.
[13:22.65]Too bad.
[13:24.39]Too bad.
[13:27.87]No, get away from me with that.
[13:30.87]And now I'm on fire.
[13:34.21]Heal up.
[13:36.21]We actually, surprisingly, we were back on our toes there.
[13:40.77]We were back on our heels.
[13:43.25]Whatever the expression is.
[13:44.38]Is that even an expression?
[13:45.48]I don't know.
[13:45.92]Probably not.
[13:47.36]We're going to pretend it is, though.
[13:48.74]And we're going to hope that the spy did not just walk right by my ass.
[13:55.08]Which he probably did.
[13:58.30]That scout just almost ate me alive.
[14:04.40]Here comes the Uber.
[14:07.74]Don't you even think about it, you two.
[14:10.57]Ah!
[14:10.87]Did I get the medic?
[14:11.49]Ah, I didn't get the medic.
[14:12.89]I didn't get the medic.
[14:15.29]We're in trouble now.
[14:20.03]We still got the sentries?
[14:21.67]If we still got those sentries, we'd be in pretty okay shape.
[14:26.72]But I'm going to assume... Okay, we got one.
[14:29.90]That might be enough to prolong this.
[14:32.06]Oh no, we got two.
[14:32.54]We got two.
[14:32.86]There's one right there.
[14:36.87]Don't worry about it.
[14:38.32]Nobody worry.
[14:39.08]We just gotta make sure this heavy medic doesn't roll in here and just destroy everything.
[14:43.70]I'm gonna try to shoot over the heavy and kill the medic.
[14:48.10]And I was sort of successful.
[14:51.14]Kind of.
[14:51.52]I did damage.
[14:56.01]Don't even... Don't turn around.
[14:57.31]Don't turn around.
[14:57.77]There's nobody behind you.
[14:59.79]Oh, I... I should have paid attention behind me.
[15:01.63]I was too busy hamming people.
[15:04.07]Oh, well.
[15:05.51]Shit.
[15:05.71]Shit.
[15:07.30]Well, that's what happens.
[15:09.82]I'm gonna try one more time.
[15:10.74]I'm gonna go balls to the wall.
[15:13.35]I'm gonna try to just cap it quick.
[15:18.09]Hashtag cap it quick.
[15:21.17]Is what I'm trying to do here.
[15:24.28]But it's probably gonna end in my own death.
[15:28.24]Considering I didn't do any jumping or anything.
[15:30.12]I didn't like sticky jump or anything.
[15:33.46]But here we go.
[15:33.90]Cap it quick.
[15:37.10]Middle point.
[15:40.05]We got a couple people coming out.
[15:41.07]Oh, we got... There we go.
[15:41.71]There we go.
[15:44.33]Alright, we got two or three down.
[15:47.49]Two or three down.
[15:47.91]What do we got?
[15:48.33]One Demoman?
[15:49.99]Where's he at?
[15:53.08]There we go.
[15:54.64]No, not quite.
