[00:51.24]Hi.
[00:55.30]How is everybody doing?
[00:58.07]Everybody doing okay?
[01:00.91]Are you doing alright?
[01:01.69]I'm talking to you.
[01:02.31]I'm talking to you, sitting in the back.
[01:07.87]Good Thursday evening, everybody.
[01:13.65]Just setting up.
[01:14.63]Starting a little early.
[01:16.91]Just a little.
[01:21.24]Gonna play more Demon's Souls.
[01:25.08]I'm having a lot of fun.
[01:26.31]The game's good.
[01:26.93]I'm still interested.
[01:30.55]And we're like more than halfway through the game.
[01:32.59]I think we're like... Probably like 70% of the way through the game at this point.
[01:37.30]Because I have to imagine.
[01:40.44]Each one of these stones has four zones?
[01:43.97]And we're pretty much at each one.
[01:45.55]I think we have to do one more third zone, but we can't have more than like five to ten more hours in the game, I would assume.
[01:54.28]Maybe.
[01:54.76]Unless I get stuck on something.
[01:58.11]But I'll be right back.
[01:59.75]Gonna make a tweet.
[02:00.83]See you guys in like two minutes.
[02:03.23]Be okay.
[02:51.11]Okay.
[02:52.29]Oh, let me just move my butt.
[02:54.15]Move my ass in the chair a little bit.
[02:58.20]Oh, come on over here.
[03:00.20]Come on over here.
[03:01.04]Come on over to Grandma's house.
[03:04.76]I got plenty of taffy.
[03:07.26]Saltwater taffy.
[03:10.26]When was the last time you guys had saltwater taffy?
[03:14.05]I don't remember.
[03:14.83]I can't tell you when it was for me.
[03:17.55]Anywho, yes, Demon's Souls.
[03:19.99]I'm not gonna lie.
[03:22.68]I did one thing off stream
[03:26.62]And everyone's gonna call me a idiot and a loser and a shit for brains.
[03:31.71]No, you're not.
[03:32.85]But I did something off stream.
[03:34.65]Because at the end of the stream, somebody was telling me that I can't upgrade this sword.
[03:40.73]Unless I have very, very specific... I didn't do any duping.
[03:43.81]No, no dupes.
[03:44.72]I didn't dupe anything.
[03:46.44]That is not... I didn't cheat.
[03:51.22]Loser.
[03:51.80]Idiot.
[03:52.94]Fat rolling.
[03:53.52]This is... I'm not fat rolling.
[03:57.64]Why is that silent?
[04:00.30]Okay.
[04:02.66]Was there audio before here?
[04:04.24]I feel like there was roll audio that's not here anymore.
[04:07.11]But anyways.
[04:08.77]Somebody told me at the end of the last stream that I need a very specific soul to upgrade this sword.
[04:15.31]And he told me where to get it.
[04:17.45]He told me specifically what I needed to do.
[04:19.97]So I off-stream got two of the required resources needed to upgrade this sword twice.
[04:27.75]So, sue me.
[04:34.67]No sounds in spirit form.
[04:36.89]Oh.
[04:38.40]Well, that took me the entire game to realize this.
[04:42.04]Anywho, let's go do that first.
[04:45.22]No, no duping.
[04:45.98]I didn't dupe anything.
[04:50.02]I have not duped.
[04:56.94]see you in court that's not cheating that's getting advice come on like cheating getting advice all right so like the last time I went to the doctor that's like saying when you go to the doctor you're cheating in life
[05:23.06]I smashed my elbow into the wall.
[05:25.68]I broke my elbow in three places.
[05:28.08]I'm not gonna go to the doctor, though, and get put in a cast.
[05:30.62]That's cheating.
[05:32.54]I'm gonna let it heal on its own.
[05:34.14]I'm gonna just snap it around, and in like six months, it'll be a haggard-ass mess.
[05:45.05]Yeah, I have the flu.
[05:47.59]The doctor's gonna say, you know, one thing you should do with the flu is eat some chicken noodle soup.
[05:52.58]No.
[05:53.58]That's cheating.
[05:55.46]I'm gonna suffer for like three weeks without taking any antibiotics.
[06:00.10]I would advise you don't.
[06:01.08]I don't take antibiotics.
[06:01.80]I'm not a cheater, doctor.
[06:03.00]I don't cheat.
[06:05.43]Okay.
[06:07.91]See you at your funeral.
[06:11.83]So let's take a look.
[06:13.67]Upgrade weapon.
[06:14.65]Dragonbone Smasher I can do.
[06:17.87]I can get this to plus two.
[06:20.61]So this will go from 215, that's, I mean, we're being dragon bone, man, so.
[06:29.53]We're just gonna, I have two colorless demon souls, we're gonna do it for you.
[06:34.43]Why not?
[06:34.97]Check this out.
[06:35.99]Bang.
[06:36.68]Forge under these conditions need 200 souls.
[06:39.60]Bingo.
[06:40.96]Dragon bone smasher, plus two.
[06:44.42]Which will bring it to, oh god, this thing is gonna be fucking disgusting.
[06:52.18]This thing is going to be disgusting.
[06:56.33]Plus two.
[06:57.57]I gotta make a dragon joke.
[07:01.07]I gotta make a dragon bone joke.
[07:13.33]I don't know.
[07:13.81]What should I say?
[07:18.47]No, fuck!
[07:19.15]Now I gotta bring the sword back to two.
[07:22.11]I gotta go minus two now.
[07:24.33]Oh, god damn it.
[07:25.37]Look, I gotta bring it back to the dragon bone smasher.
[07:27.99]That's minus two.
[07:32.84]That was a bad joke.
[07:33.62]I have to bring it down to its default bone smasher.
[07:42.39]Alright, hold on.
[07:43.90]Do I need... I need another color.
[07:45.90]This makes my regen better if I upgrade this, but... I'd want to just smash it.
[07:51.08]Please don't do it.
[07:52.60]Don't do it.
[07:53.20]I'm not gonna do it.
[07:54.28]I'm not gonna do it.
[07:56.28]I do need to repair some of this shit.
[07:57.51]This thing is broke.
[07:58.69]Anything else?
[08:00.99]Wow, this thing is, like, broken, too.
[08:02.53]Let me use all my souls on all my broken shit.
[08:06.39]Okay.
[08:08.57]Okay, let's go.
[08:10.36]I got a plus two dragon bone.
[08:16.50]The weapon can't go negative.
[08:21.96]By the way, I'm online again.
[08:23.66]I'm going to try doing the online thing again.
[08:28.24]Last time, I thought it was giving me framerate problems, and it might have been because they disappeared.
[08:32.66]But playing online is fun.
[08:34.66]You get to see all the weird shit.
[08:38.17]Didn't I say there was no stream tonight?
[08:40.03]Uh, nope.
[08:41.89]There's a stream tonight.
[08:47.69]Alright, make sure I have, uh, no stuff.
[08:50.21]I don't have no stuff right now.
[08:54.11]Online because I was duping.
[08:55.25]I was not duping.
[08:56.23]I'm gonna hold on to the claymore just in case.
[09:00.35]What about anything else?
[09:02.17]Uh, nope.
[09:03.25]I have a pretty good on equipment burden and item burden.
[09:05.97]I'm fine.
[09:07.90]What do I have for rings right now?
[09:11.49]Herculean strength and great strength.
[09:13.27]I don't need to wear this right now.
[09:16.55]I need to put on the... I'm going to take a humanity.
[09:24.61]Because I'm not sitting.
[09:27.27]I have so many of these.
[09:28.25]What's the point of holding on to them the whole game, right?
[09:32.89]I have 20 of these things.
[09:39.43]It's a waste of a ring slot.
[09:40.54]If I can just get to full health, why would I waste a ring slot?
[09:43.76]I could have, like, a ton of regen.
[09:45.52]Alright, so, let's start.
[09:46.50]Where am I gonna go?
[09:47.14]I have, like, a bunch of options here.
[09:48.38]I can go... I can do 1-4.
[09:52.02]I can do... I already did this 2-4.
[09:53.26]No, did I?
[09:53.80]I don't know.
[09:56.52]Uh, there's 3-3.
[09:56.85]3-3.
[09:56.91]There's 4-3, I believe.
[09:58.03]No, 4-2.
[09:58.13]Let's do 4-2.
[10:08.50]I feel like I haven't... 4-2.
[10:10.04]I've been neglecting 4 and 5 this entire game.
[10:12.38]So we're going to go 4-2.
[10:12.92]I'm going to do the adjuster.
[10:23.53]3-4-2.
[10:24.78]And thank you, Squirts, for the five bucks.
[10:26.16]Love your streams.
[10:26.68]Don't get to say happy birthday.
[10:27.62]So here I go.
[10:28.14]Happy birthday.
[10:28.64]Well, thank you, Squirts, for the five bucks and a happy birthday.
[10:30.58]Appreciate it.
[10:33.29]Let me touch your bum.
[10:34.14]Thanks for the $1.
[10:35.12]Hey, Jerma, I'm not sure how to say this, but I'll try to say it anyway.
[10:38.68]Today's another day to find you.
[10:41.19]Shying away.
[10:43.65]Take on me.
[10:44.21]Take me on.
[10:44.77]I'll be gone in a day or two.
[10:48.79]Sticked Renegade, thanks for the five dollars.
[10:50.21]In celebration of me getting the Rat King in Destiny 2, you should watch Rat Movie 1 and 2 on stream.
[10:56.03]One day, I'm going to just appease you.
[10:58.70]We're going to open the stream one day, just playing them back to back.
[11:01.72]I'm not even going to say a word.
[11:02.66]I'm just going to stream those two YouTube videos and then just keep going.
[11:07.38]What am I looking at here?
[11:09.52]Is it already down here?
[11:12.15]Did I have to come up there?
[11:13.27]Which way did I cut?
[11:14.21]This was so long ago that I don't even know which direction I'm supposed to run.
[11:17.49]No, it's definitely out that way.
[11:19.27]Because I had to drop down to fight this guy.
[11:22.71]And then the third one, yeah.
[11:23.77]The third one.
[11:24.11]But thank you for the, uh... Whoa, hold on.
[11:27.47]Thank you sticks, though, for the things.
[11:29.47]Uh-huh.
[11:29.93]Let's go.
[11:32.59]I believe this is the way I need to go.
[11:37.13]The rat movies are just an urban legend.
[11:40.63]Some might say that.
[11:42.24]Some might say that they are an urban legend.
[11:43.56]Yeah, this is the way.
[11:46.24]Alright, 42 soul remains.
[11:49.01]An item that I've never used.
[11:53.95]I am just a guy standing here.
[11:56.23]Who is this?
[11:56.53]Ah, grave robber.
[11:57.57]When did I meet this guy before?
[12:14.37]I'm gonna buy it.
[12:17.92]It's got a kunai.
[12:23.22]Leather shield.
[12:25.40]Leather cap.
[12:28.44]Thank you, evil face, for the one dollar.
[12:33.97]My little brother won't stop watching the rat movies.
[12:37.22]God, what have I done?
[12:38.96]Somebody I ought to warn you about.
[12:41.04]A fellow who lacks common decency.
[12:44.70]They call him Patches the Hyena.
[12:47.62]And he's the one that laid that trap for me.
[12:50.44]He's the kind of person who'd stab his mother in the back.
[12:53.94]If you happen to spot him, you'll be doing us all a favor by putting him out of his misery.
[12:59.78]Now, this guy wants me to kill Patches.
[13:02.35]Hmm.
[13:03.53]But a bit of indulgence, go.
[13:05.29]Okay.
[13:06.37]So, what do you guys think I should do?
[13:09.15]Should I kill Patches 1 or Patches 2?
[13:12.50]It's the same guy.
[13:14.56]The only difference is, like, this guy's voice is a little sexier than Patches.
[13:18.08]So, who gets to live?
[13:21.26]The red girl with $5, thank you for the $5.
[13:24.02]Can I get a 500-bit joke?
[13:25.90]Yeah, it's me holding R2 right now.
[13:35.22]The last time I killed an NPC, everybody fucking lost their minds.
[13:41.74]And you know what?
[13:42.44]I... Wait a minute!
[13:44.39]Oh, I thought it was a trap.
[13:48.33]Is it death?
[13:55.60]Is this a boss?
[14:04.06]Am I just fighting a boss right now?
[14:07.01]Death in the ring race.
[14:08.51]Okay.
[14:14.17]I guess we're going this way.
[14:15.71]Oh, boy.
[14:16.17]This is scary.
[14:17.39]I don't like this.
[14:21.80]And they make War of the Worlds tripod sounds.
[14:27.86]Ugh.
[14:27.98]I think I can hit them one time and they fucking disintegrate.
[14:41.89]Oh, shit!
[14:46.83]Dude, the dragon bone.
[14:49.15]This dragon bone does so much damage.
[14:55.79]I gotta get the item that's over there, too.
[14:57.03]I feel like those guys come back.
[15:05.82]Okay, I can go across.
[15:07.04]What about down?
[15:08.84]Eventually.
[15:09.36]There's that weirdo.
[15:16.57]Watch out.
[15:16.89]Just my luck, they're gonna drop a fucking cliff on me here.
[15:20.41]Oh, okay.
[15:21.31]There's like five of them stuffed in here.
[15:23.07]There's too many of them in here.
[15:27.01]Oh boy, that's dangerous.
[15:36.58]Oh!
[15:37.16]Okay, that guy summons them.
[15:38.22]I figured it out.
[15:41.12]I understand now.
[15:43.62]No!
[15:44.38]No, no!
[15:46.33]No!
[15:49.17]Oh, it hurts.
[15:50.51]It hurts.
[15:51.61]Oh, it hurts!
[15:53.25]I can't even see, it's too dark.
[16:05.99]What's going on?
[16:07.21]What did I step on?
[16:07.91]I stepped on another thing!
[16:18.08]Okay, well... God damn it.
[16:23.54]I'm dead.
[16:24.19]Coming back from the cutscene... There's too much going on right now.
[16:28.73]There's just too many things happening.
[16:41.82]Alright, well, now I know, and look, now I've wasted the fucking... I'm doing it again.
[16:53.11]They threw way too many things at me at the same time.
[16:55.95]I fell down a cliff, because that's just what happens when you just fall down cliffs in this game.
[17:01.97]Where are they?
[17:09.18]And then the fucking death just was there.
[17:14.55]And he's in a pitch black room, so it's hard to even see where he's going.
[17:19.43]And then I got a cutscene.
[17:22.74]Bye.
[17:23.06]Alright, well, fucking... These guys are not a problem.
[17:27.34]I just have to kill them with one hit.
[17:29.52]Just don't fall down the cliff.
[17:36.02]Yeah, I saw the Tom Cruise movie.
[17:37.36]I know how to get rid of you.
[17:39.80]Actually, wait a minute.
[17:40.46]I don't think I've ever watched that movie in full.
[17:44.86]I just went to the... You know when you go to YouTube and you just type in... War of the World scary parts.
[17:51.33]That's what I did.
[17:53.65]Alright, where are they?
[17:54.39]There's like three of them here, isn't there?
[17:55.53]Aren't there like a bunch of people there?
[18:05.82]You don't even like sometimes when people ask me if I've ever seen a movie And I tell them yeah, I've seen it.
[18:11.68]You know it might sometimes it might not even be true I just watched like the 19-minute highlight reel of of clips back-to-back on like YouTube You ever see a Citizen Kane yeah, I watched him like say I watched him like do an interview and
[18:30.42]And then I watched him, like, swear at somebody.
[18:32.28]And then I saw, like, they're looking at you, kid.
[18:34.92]And that was it.
[18:35.87]I saw the whole movie, pretty much.
[18:39.19]What the hell are these?
[18:44.61]Okay.
[18:45.19]Well, Patches is in there.
[18:48.43]Jesus Christ.
[18:49.25]Hold on.
[18:49.89]Alright, here we go, guys.
[18:51.13]This is what I'm talking about.
[18:52.52]Why are these on my bar?
[18:55.80]Just go that way.
[18:57.16]Does this work on these guys?
[19:07.23]I think it, no.
[19:08.07]I think it does, no it doesn't.
[19:13.35]I gotta get rid of death, he's right there.
[19:19.75]He's just hiding behind this pillar.
[19:22.81]There he is, alright, come on.
[19:24.71]Like, one or two hits.
[19:27.91]One hit, he's done.
[19:31.43]Alright, okay, now I can take my time.
[19:37.39]Patches is just in that room.
[19:39.43]I'm kind of scared to do anything with anything to do with him.
[19:41.53]Let me just look around first, hold on.
[19:51.68]He's gonna do a trick.
[19:53.88]He's gonna go, oh, I'm sorry to see you that night.
[19:56.92]I didn't think that you would know I would be here.
[20:00.06]Oh, I would never do something like that to you.
[20:01.66]Why would I?
[20:04.35]Pick up these trinkets on the ground.
[20:07.57]I promise you'll be fine.
[20:08.67]Oh, hello again.
[20:15.41]Hey, don't turn a cold shoulder.
[20:17.13]I didn't mean to do you wrong.
[20:18.93]Really.
[20:20.77]Come on now.
[20:22.35]We've got better things to fret about.
[20:26.34]That pit there is filled with treasure.
[20:30.24]But, uh... I can't get to it myself.
[20:34.70]Go on, have a look.
[20:37.52]It's more riches than I've ever dreamed of.
[20:47.84]He's gonna push me.
[20:49.56]I've already been here before.
[20:50.86]I know this.
[20:51.44]I know.
[20:51.82]Look at the way he's moving around.
[20:54.51]You don't act like this.
[20:56.23]Your AI doesn't freak out and follow me.
[20:59.77]Have a look at that treasure down in the pit.
[21:01.91]Then we'll work out a way to fish it out.
[21:10.94]He has a spear too.
[21:11.84]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[21:17.20]Oh no!
[21:20.65]I didn't think it was gonna be a cutscene.
[21:22.69]No, I didn't think it was gonna be a cutscene.
[21:24.53]I thought it was gonna be like a... Oh my fucking god, dude.
[21:30.05]Why is it a cutscene?
[21:40.63]It's always a cutscene, but I did well at least this way there's a guy down here hold on oh Shit, there's like a few people down here all right hold on a second so That's like the devil, and that's the angel on my shoulder Am I about to have like a very very conscious decision to make We'll find out
[22:08.85]Okay, we're gonna go to the angel, because that's just the one you have to listen to.
[22:14.08]Heavens.
[22:15.48]Did you fall for that little devil's trap?
[22:18.06]I told you to kill me.
[22:18.94]Well, I did the same.
[22:21.62]He fooled me, and now I am stuck here.
[22:25.77]The reverberations seem to suggest that we are connected to the outside.
[22:31.75]But dark, fearsome souls stand between us and freedom.
[22:37.33]But have no fear.
[22:39.65]God will cleanse us of evil.
[22:41.85]Okay.
[22:43.09]Pray with me.
[22:44.64]Mbasa.

[22:56.84]This is gonna be a flip-flop.
[22:58.23]This is gonna be a flip-flop situation.
[23:03.15]The guy that's like, pray with me, I'm a good guy, is a bad guy.
[23:06.24]And the Kylo Ren over here is gonna be the good guy.
[23:09.06]Yep.
[23:12.82]I can already tell that's what's gonna happen.
[23:19.36]Okay, no, he's... Alright, well, how do I, like, prove to him that... No, whatever.
[23:23.20]You know, he just has to die.
[23:24.70]And we're gonna one-hit him with the dragon bone.
[23:28.79]I mean, two hit him.
[23:31.35]Oh, shit.
[23:32.27]Oh, well.
[23:37.53]Don't get too cocky.
[23:38.89]That's like the worst.
[23:39.95]Don't do it.
[23:40.81]This guy can't even hurt you.
[23:46.48]Shit.
[23:50.76]Alright, go.
[23:58.12]Chunk of the Dark Moonstone.
[23:59.90]All right, now, do you say anything else after I do that, or what?
[24:04.96]Oh, it's you.
[24:07.19]Did you cleanse the world of another dark soul today?
[24:11.27]That's why they named it that.
[24:12.17]God has chosen you, and for that we are thankful.
[24:15.41]Dark souls.
[24:16.95]Mbasa.
[24:17.90]Mbasa.
[24:21.94]God has chosen you.
[24:23.34]Mbasa.
[24:23.82]Thank you.
[24:29.00]Uh, alright.
[24:30.08]So, how do I get out of here?
[24:35.95]The door just opens.
[24:36.97]I killed the wrong guy.
[24:43.69]I wouldn't be... Why do I think this guy's gonna run behind me?
[24:51.44]I'm so paranoid.
[25:00.23]I'm sorry you did that.
[25:00.97]I kicked you in.
[25:03.81]Unfortunately, don't hold it against me.

[25:30.53]Isn't that the ring everybody wanted me to have?
[25:42.20]Everyone told me about that ring.
[25:45.38]Become harder for enemies to detect.
[25:46.80]He had 165 souls.
[25:50.47]No wonder he was useless.
[25:54.93]Alright, but now I gotta get that.
[25:56.23]I gotta drop down and get that item.
[26:01.55]Alright, so, like, but he's, like, still in the town, right?

[26:14.39]By rolling?
[26:19.29]Let me line this up.
[26:23.85]No.
[26:24.40]How do you get this?
[26:34.45]He's dead.
[26:35.99]Well, it's alright.

[26:58.08]Now nobody has to deal with his shit anymore.
[27:08.93]I gotta go this way.
[27:09.59]This is where that dead stingrays were.

[44:38.79]Hitless.
[44:40.15]And Ronin's Ring.
[44:44.78]You know, they had to have done this just to fuck with you because... I keep thinking these are those orbs.
[44:57.64]Don't ever two-hand down here.
[44:59.70]Constantly have this shield out at all times.
[45:01.88]I'm going to pee so bad.
[45:08.14]What am I going to do?
[45:10.20]Stop right here?
[45:10.80]No, one of those things is going to blow me up.
[45:17.32]Look at all this.
[45:19.68]It's a mess.
[45:20.70]Okay.
[45:20.98]Well, I got the, like, cool item, so... I can see one of those trails.
[45:35.78]The reason why I'm killing all these is because it's just free sticky white stuff.
[45:39.04]Like, why not?
[45:41.10]Why wouldn't you want it?
[45:43.64]I think that's... Yeah, I think that's it.
[45:46.81]Stop fighting slugs and go through the room.
[45:48.21]Well, I'm trying.
[45:52.58]It's free sticky white stuff.
[45:53.90]There's a lot of sticky white stuff down here.
[45:55.52]Alright, I got it all.
[46:00.02]Let's go back up.
[46:02.90]Oh, fuck.
[46:07.40]I can hear them.
[46:11.69]Alright, I'm done.
[46:12.57]Regardless if I didn't get all the items, I don't care.
[46:14.59]Just get me through the room.
[46:16.87]We got any, like, items up here?
[46:20.15]Like, since when do I give that much shits about the items that are in this room?
[46:25.07]I got to get out of here.
[46:26.63]Otherwise, it's going to be a disaster.
[46:28.31]Disaster!
[46:37.62]I can't.
[46:38.84]Something's going on tonight in my brain, guys.
[46:42.86]I am, like, goofy right now.
[46:47.25]What is that?
[46:49.37]I don't know.
[46:52.60]Is something going to stand up over here?
[46:59.84]I'm just waiting for it to come over here.
[47:05.92]This is the part of the game where I'm so paranoid that I just scream one word.
[47:12.00]That's what happens.
[47:15.10]Where is this?
[47:25.36]Legendary soul.
[47:28.20]I don't like the way this looks.
[47:32.68]There's a door up there.
[47:36.06]Wait, hold on.
[47:36.54]This is a fog gate to go back.
[47:37.96]Why can't I go back here?
[47:41.63]Huh?
[47:47.53]Is this the boss door?
[47:58.07]Why is my game fucking up again?
[48:08.06]This is a boss door.
[48:09.72]That's what this is.
[48:11.34]I'm getting ready.
[48:11.84]Hold on.
[48:20.13]Fuck.
[48:20.45]It's because I went online.
[48:22.05]I can't fight this boss right now.
[48:25.97]Not like this.
[48:35.22]Wait, what?
[48:35.60]No, I thought that was a door.
[48:38.00]I could go pee?
[48:39.48]Okay, hold on.
[48:39.92]I'm gonna go pee.
[48:42.75]Alright, yeah.
[48:43.09]I'm gonna go pee.
[48:44.17]Be right back.
[48:47.13]Quit then come back?
[48:52.12]Alright, hold on.
[48:52.58]Let me get the pee out of me first.
[48:54.22]Be right back.
[49:47.52]Wait, what?
[50:49.54]Alright, we're going to go for it.
[50:52.26]I think.
[50:52.54]I think I'm going to go for it.
[50:58.59]Before I go, before I start it though, let's say thank you to Ivory.
[51:04.87]Ivory, thanks for the $2.50.
[51:05.95]Quick question, Derma.
[51:06.61]I've recently been a nutritionist and seeing how you've always been eating healthy on stream, I wanted to know your opinion.
[51:13.20]Uh...
[51:15.66]On Chinese chicken, you know the one where you have a drumstick and your brain stops ticking.
[51:20.88]We already did that last stream.
[51:23.94]Yeah, see, alright, you got me, you got me to, like, to say, like, you got me to read that first half, and then I was like, oh, okay.
[51:32.72]You guys are getting more creative with me reading song lyrics.
[51:38.87]Alright, anyways.
[51:41.03]Oh, thank you, though.
[51:41.63]Thank you, Hyena Dip for the $1.
[51:43.15]Happy Halloween.
[51:44.49]Spooked you.
[51:45.19]Yep.
[51:47.61]Also, thank you, Red Girl, for the $1.
[51:49.05]I'm in charge now.
[51:52.25]Says who?
[51:53.37]Says who?
[51:58.25]I read the entire beginning of Welcome to... I don't even know what that is.
[52:01.45]I don't watch those shows.
[52:04.83]I don't read those magazines.
[52:06.19]I don't read those movies.
[52:09.73]But anyways, thank you, Red Girl, for the $6 there.
[52:15.12]In total.
[52:15.56]And then Deathman, thank you for the one dollar.
[52:17.34]Finally decided to get some bits just for you.
[52:18.94]Just want to say thank you for providing consistently entertaining content.
[52:21.54]Well, thank you.
[52:22.94]Thanks for sticking around.
[52:24.91]So.
[52:26.17]I didn't get the Hearthstone joke.
[52:28.93]Alright, well, let's just fucking first try this guy.
[52:31.75]Whoever he is.
[52:34.29]He's on the ceiling.
[52:38.11]Shit, I have the stupid Kling ring on.
[52:40.30]God damn it.
[52:53.08]Holy shit.
[52:54.02]Okay.
[52:57.64]All right.
[52:58.96]Does he stay like this the whole game?
[53:00.58]Does he sit like in the frog position?
[53:02.60]No, of course not.
[53:03.42]Here we go.
[53:10.06]Here we do it.
[53:10.57]Let's do it.
[53:11.21]Old hero.
[53:13.05]Whoa.
[53:13.25]All right.
[53:16.86]What do you got?
[53:17.42]Whoa!
[53:29.06]Okay, he's freaking out.
[53:30.14]Whoa!
[53:40.76]Okay, that's a move I didn't see coming.
[53:43.10]Move out of the way, please.
[53:52.81]Oh shit, not cocky, not cocky.
[53:54.98]I have limited stamina with this thing.
[54:02.22]Backing up, backing up, backing up!
[54:12.56]We got one more swing.
[54:25.93]It's like the mummy.
[54:32.50]Back it up, back it up.
[54:34.66]Back it up!
[54:44.01]Get Dragon Bone, buddy.
[54:49.03]Easy.
[55:01.41]Back it up.
[55:03.69]Don't let him get too close.
[55:11.12]What is he doing?
[55:11.74]Is he fucking serious?
[55:17.30]Oh, he's... He's like... He's blind, isn't he?
[55:21.33]Is he?
[55:25.89]Fuck.
[55:34.57]So he's just like the dragon.
[55:40.41]He didn't hear that.
[55:41.75]Don't mind that.
[55:42.37]Don't mind me.
[55:45.27]Blue dive.
[55:47.93]One more hit.
[55:52.43]Don't get... Don't do it.
[55:53.23]Don't do it!
[55:53.61]I was gonna get so cocky there.
[56:00.30]See you later.
[56:04.65]Or maybe not.
[56:05.51]Maybe not.
[56:05.95]Maybe not!
[56:09.21]Okay.
[56:16.07]Okay.
[56:17.83]That guy wasn't too bad.
[56:22.74]That was easier than I thought it was going to be.
[56:27.32]Oh, Moon Grass.
[56:30.44]Hardest boss in the game.
[56:31.46]No, Flame Lurker was...
[56:35.01]was insane.
[56:36.81]I don't know what kind of drugs I was on that stream, but I don't know how I beat that guy first try.
[56:42.54]That was fucking extremely difficult.
[56:45.98]This guy, not so much.
[56:48.52]I mean, I can still see how I could get caught by something.
[56:50.71]Just gotta be careful.
[56:58.75]There was one more item.
[56:59.49]Where was it?
[57:12.30]No, I'm just kidding.
[57:13.14]I'm not taking drugs.
[57:15.34]That was a reference to like, you know, what kind of drugs are you on, Jeremy?
[57:20.05]You know, like some people say that.
[57:22.51]It's a reference to that.
[57:26.35]Hero Demon Soul.
[57:27.45]Let's go back.
[57:30.81]Is that a... Is there a boss right here?
[57:33.76]Right after me?
[57:43.82]Streamer bones old man All right, come on PGR PG dash 18 come on All right, so I Need to get 36,000 souls with this thing or I can get the large sword of searching I

[58:52.48]This one.
[58:55.23]This one.
[58:58.23]And... This one.
[59:04.45]Break them.
[59:08.08]Wow, these are terrible.
[59:11.64]The weapon's only good for farming.
[59:20.96]Don't buy a level, just buy grass.
[59:22.68]Well, I have a lot of grass.
[59:30.04]So I need to get offline, because it's doing the thing again.
[59:34.66]But let's level up first.
[59:38.16]Did I see the Red Dead Redemption 2 trailer?
[59:39.74]Yes, I did.
[59:42.01]I am looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2.
[59:43.75]Looks great.
[59:44.43]One more in Endurance.
[59:51.69]One more in Vitality?
[59:53.31]What should I get?
[59:56.07]Endurance, you don't need more than like 25 to 30.
[59:58.93]I think I might just keep Endurance where it is from now on.
[60:04.48]Vitality, though, is a different story.
[60:05.94]I'll probably get Vitality.
[60:13.14]Just be this beefy ass.
[60:17.87]Yeah, just get it, whatever.
[60:21.55]99 strength?
[60:21.99]No.
[60:24.05]But I do need to, like, sign out of PSN.
[60:26.34]So let me, like, fucking quit.
[60:27.80]Give me one second.
[60:28.94]Because it's doing that shit again.
[60:32.36]So I need to just sign out of PSN.
[60:34.56]And, like, restart the game.
[60:35.84]So give me one moment.
[60:36.96]Hold on.
[60:42.77]Yeah, so Red Dead Redemption 2 just looks beautiful.
[60:47.69]Hopefully it's good.
[60:52.30]Streams over?
[60:52.84]No, it's not.
[60:53.34]What are you talking about?
[60:54.06]We just started like an hour ago.
[60:57.58]Red Dead Redemption 2 looks generic in the trailer.
[61:00.34]I mean, they kind of did that in the GTA 5 trailer too, didn't they?
[61:05.21]Remember the GTA 5 trailer?
[61:07.84]The original one.
[61:09.06]It was like, why did I move here?
[61:10.80]Maybe it was the weather.
[61:13.44]People are walking down the street.
[61:17.40]Oh, there's a windmill.
[61:19.56]There wasn't anything in that trailer that was too crazy.
[61:24.31]So let me... Give me one second.
[61:29.19]How do I get... I don't think this button works.
[61:34.15]I don't think I have to do this.
[61:40.68]Yes, I do.
[61:43.16]Okay.
[61:43.40]So... PlayStation sign out.
[61:47.49]Please.
[61:48.31]That would be wonderful.
[61:51.77]Internet connection.
[61:55.25]Yeah.
[61:59.23]They don't want to reveal the whole game in the trailer.
[62:00.87]Yeah.
[62:07.11]Thoughts on the character?
[62:07.95]I mean...
[62:12.13]I don't know.
[62:12.58]I can't give, like... He said, like, three generic sentences in the trailer.
[62:17.30]So... I can't really give you an assessment to how cool I think the character is.
[62:22.56]Because, honestly, he just was like, Get over here!
[62:25.71]Where's my money?
[62:27.47]I'll take you on!
[62:28.95]But he didn't really do anything, so... That should be good.
[62:33.05]Yeah, let's come.
[62:35.70]Let's bring it back.
[62:42.83]Sorry about that.
[62:43.59]We were getting the frame problems though.
[62:51.83]He did a shooty shoot in the trailer though.
[62:58.33]Kind of looks like the Marlboro Man.
[63:00.33]Yeah.
[63:04.23]Why would they call it Red Dead Redemption 2 instead of something like Red Dead Renegades or something else?
[63:09.47]Yeah, that's one thing I don't understand about the Red Dead series.
[63:12.57]So they made Red Dead Revolver.
[63:15.37]And there's a guy, Red.
[63:18.35]You know, like, what does Red have to do with any of these games?
[63:20.97]Like, Red.
[63:23.66]Red Dead Redemption.
[63:24.70]Red's not in this game.
[63:25.52]Hey, Red Dead Redemption 2!
[63:28.88]Where is he?
[63:31.10]Is he going to show up and be like, this is a game about me.
[63:34.38]I'm the new bad guy.
[63:41.71]Because it rhymes?
[63:44.27]And where's the dead part?
[63:50.22]Red dead.
[63:52.42]I guess they could spin it like, oh no, when you're dead, you're red blood.
[63:58.08]There's bright red dead blood on you.
[64:00.42]I can see the spin.
[64:05.12]But Red Dead Redemption 2... Well, yeah, I feel like it should have been like Red Dead Revolution.
[64:14.87]Red Dead Restriction.
[64:22.15]So, I guess it is like it's in the same series as Red Dead Redemption 1, right?
[64:32.63]Red Dead Ravioli.
[64:38.15]Red Dead Royal Rumble.
[64:41.45]There's a bunch of John Marstons fighting each other.
[64:43.23]Alright, let's get this back.
[64:48.33]Uh, late moon.
[64:49.19]Full moon.
[64:52.48]I have the new moon.
[64:53.34]I should probably... I need to put that on, but I'm just... Every time I play a game like this, I get so concerned to use those really good items.
[65:02.40]Alright, I want to see what's through that door.
[65:05.14]Let's go to 4-4.
[65:05.94]4-3, whatever it is.
[65:07.75]I want to see what's next.
[65:09.49]There's a fog gate there.
[65:12.61]I want to... Let's go through.
[65:15.97]4-3.
[65:22.10]Hey, Sticks!
[65:22.82]Thanks for the five bucks.
[65:23.90]Red Dead Renegade is the perfect name for some reason.
[65:26.00]I don't know why.
[65:28.28]Well, yeah.
[65:29.16]I guess they, um...
[65:32.10]I guess they want to just keep the brand loyalty, and maybe people would be like, I don't know what that is, right?
[65:36.80]Dead Redemption is the thing I know.
[65:38.36]I don't know the other thing with the other R. But thanks for the five bucks, man.
[65:45.37]CC131988, thank you for the five dollars.
[65:50.51]Hey, Jeremy, I've been following you on YouTube for quite some time, and I watch streams when I can.
[65:55.38]You never fail to make my day better, and I thought I'd contribute to something important to me.
[65:59.14]Keep it up, friend.
[66:00.70]Well, thanks a lot, Cece.
[66:04.16]It's a very kind message.
[66:06.28]I'm glad you enjoy yourself.
[66:08.79]Everybody that says these things, like, I'm glad you, like, are enjoying yourself.
[66:12.25]And enjoying yourselves.
[66:15.11]If you aren't, I'm doing something wrong.
[66:17.05]And I need to improve.
[66:19.69]You see me after class, like, needs fucking improvement.
[66:25.28]I don't want to get a D on my stream.
[66:27.90]Because then you'll have to talk to my mother.
[66:32.85]Somebody said they're not... Yeah, this guy said he's not enjoying the stream.
[66:39.01]Fuck.
[66:40.49]Um... I don't know.
[66:43.87]What do you want me to do?
[66:45.11]Like, should I do something crazy?
[66:47.41]Is this a boss?
[66:48.47]This is a boss.
[66:52.31]Holy shit, it's a back-to-back boss.
[66:58.66]Do I actually get to fight one of the manta rays?
[67:04.76]This asshole that's been throwing shit at me this whole game.
[67:10.29]Alright, good.
[67:13.33]Sorry excuse for a butterfly.
[67:14.83]Oh god.
[67:26.06]What is this, uh... Cloverfield?
[67:28.24]I have to deal with all the little ant parasite things first?
[67:35.23]This thing is fucking huge.
[67:37.45]Storm King.
[67:41.93]Oh, boy.
[67:45.77]Do I get him to land?
[67:48.33]Or do I not complete Demon's Soul?
[67:52.66]Just checking.
[67:53.38]Just checking.
[67:53.92]Hold the shield up for this one.
[68:01.86]Looking around.
[68:02.52]Okay, I see...
[68:06.34]They throw invisible grenades.
[68:14.44]Wow.
[68:16.78]There's a lot of them, too.
[68:17.92]There's so many of these things.
[68:20.58]I gotta keep the pace up, because I'll get hit in the back.
[68:25.89]What about up here?
[68:26.43]I'm being such an item collection weirdo.
[68:28.37]Just figure out the boss.
[68:30.27]This whole area is, like, enormous, so I'll be okay.
[68:35.73]There's an item in here.
[68:36.33]I gotta get it.
[68:41.65]I can't get it.
[68:51.57]Holy arrow.
[68:52.51]It's giving me a bunch of arrows.
[68:53.63]I have to shoot the bow.
[68:54.99]I don't think I... I don't have a bow in my inventory.
[68:58.21]I can't fight this boss.
[69:00.01]It's giving me like 50 arrows.
[69:10.21]I don't have a bow.
[69:15.89]Whoa, arrows!
[69:16.49]Is it one of those situations where I have to block one of these and hit it back?
[69:23.20]God, that would be such a sweet mechanic.
[69:31.36]There's something over here.
[69:32.06]Alright, there's another item.
[69:34.10]Is it one of those cookie monsters over here?
[69:35.99]There's two cookie monsters!
[69:41.86]Alright, well, there- Storm- Wait.
[69:45.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[69:46.44]Storm ruler.
[69:49.28]Wait, hold on.
[69:51.12]This is in Dark Souls 3.
[69:53.57]It's a Dark Souls 3 gimmick?
[69:59.89]Do I have to equip the storm ruler and, like, tornado something?
[70:02.87]Are you kidding me?
[70:07.55]Why did they do this again?
[70:10.59]They thought this was such a cool idea that they decided to do it again?
[70:13.89]When am I going to have the time to equip it?
[70:20.56]Wasn't the fucking giant fight in Dark Souls 3 unanimously considered the worst fight in the whole game?
[70:32.06]How do I use it?
[70:35.52]Oh.
[70:36.58]Okay, that's how I use it.
[70:40.91]Alright, okay.
[70:44.37]There's so many people to lock on, the game doesn't know where I want to go.
[70:47.23]Okay, got him.
[70:54.81]Got him.
[70:56.37]He's gonna clear out all of his babies and we're fine.
[70:58.45]I didn't pay attention to my health, because I have not been.
[71:10.91]They drop interesting items, though, that's for sure.
[71:17.69]Like, wasn't, like, on, like, darksoulsfans.com, like, the Storm Ruler fight is, like, the dumbest thing that they've ever done?
[71:28.12]Like, on darksouls, on soulsbornsfanboy.org!
[71:43.50]Am I wasting my time, or do I actually need to clear all these guys?
[71:58.97]He doesn't, like, summon more of the other...
[72:07.62]You know what?
[72:08.09]The one thing I will say about this is that it doesn't take as long as Storm Ruler does in Dark Souls 3.
[72:13.65]That shit takes, like, way longer to charge up.
[72:22.51]And here comes the last... I can't... Don't fuck this up, because holy shit, man, this is going to be really, really annoying to do this again.
[72:28.20]Here he comes.
[72:29.80]Okay, get him.
[72:33.14]This moth...
[72:36.33]What is he doing?
[72:36.91]Okay, he's coming in, like, he's coming in really strangely.
[72:39.83]Like, I don't like this.
[72:40.45]He's gonna do, like, a giant beam or something, right?
[72:45.62]What in the name of God is he doing?!
[72:47.42]Right in the tummy!
[72:57.06]Okay, I get it.
[72:57.68]Right in the stomach.
[73:04.05]Oh, God damn it.
[73:06.13]Oh, God damn it.
[73:07.31]No.
[73:08.47]No, I need to get... No.
[73:10.87]Please tell me he just comes around.
[73:16.15]Oh, boy.
[73:16.51]He's gonna do the thing where he just rains arrows.
[73:19.85]I'm running away.
[73:21.87]I gotta dodge them.
[73:22.53]I gotta dodge them correctly.
[73:27.08]Holy shit!
[73:27.68]That's a lot of arrows!
[73:36.29]Get his stomach!
[73:36.99]Get the stomach!
[73:38.14]Get the stomach!
[73:52.90]Enemy AC-130.
[73:53.82]Oh, boy.
[73:55.48]I gotta, like... Please don't get hit by, like, a hundred of these.
[73:59.13]Oh, fuck.
[73:59.73]What if I... Should I take the shield out?
[74:01.88]I don't know.
[74:02.64]I don't know if I should take the shield.
[74:03.74]Just qualm- Just qualm down!
[74:05.21]Just calm down, qualm down.
[74:06.31]Alright, I qualmed it.
[74:12.03]That should be it.
[74:19.03]Don't let him get away.
[74:19.69]He's gotta- I gotta do it one more time.
[74:21.09]Come on!
[74:21.63]One more time!
[74:22.11]Hit it!
[74:23.89]Oh, you shithead!
[74:24.89]You stupid asshole!
[74:27.98]Oh... God, no!
[74:33.86]Get in a spot where I know I can dodge.
[74:35.24]Maybe I should just run.
[74:39.64]I think I'm just going to run.
[74:41.50]Here they come.
[74:43.96]Here they come!
[74:54.61]See you later.
[75:05.17]See you later.
[75:09.13]Music.
[75:09.73]See me after class.
[75:17.70]Okay, I will say that... That was probably a little bit more fun than the giant fight in Dark Souls 3.
[75:29.83]Okay.
[75:30.03]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[75:34.22]There's an item over there.
[75:36.63]Storm Demon Soul.
[75:37.69]Pure Cloudstone.
[75:43.73]Cloudstone.
[75:44.39]Lots of Cloudstone.
[75:48.69]Cool.
[75:50.81]Is that an NPC?
[75:57.67]No.
[75:58.05]Okay.
[75:59.21]For a second I thought this guy was just sitting here the whole time.
[76:09.25]Vape Nation Stone.
[76:11.40]God.
[76:20.66]You have no way to fight it without the Storm Ruler.
[76:22.92]That's like the, yeah.
[76:24.34]So, because I went back in time and played this Dark Souls 3 first, when I saw Storm Ruler, I'm like, okay, I know what to do.
[76:32.27]If I just picked up that weapon, I would've, I would've just got a bow.
[76:36.05]I would've had no absolute fucking clue what the hell I was doing.
[76:39.27]Without playing Dark Souls 3 and coming back and seeing this item, no way.
[76:43.75]I would lose every time.
[76:44.81]And I would get frustrated and I'd be like, I quit.
[76:46.33]Because I would have to shoot the guy with the bow like a hundred times.
[76:50.91]I think I got everything.
[76:54.07]No, I didn't.
[76:54.55]This is why you don't leave immediately.
[76:58.12]Make sure you check every cranny.
[77:13.03]By the way, I need to take this torn ruler off.
[77:14.73]Because it doesn't do anything else besides...
[77:21.00]Let's just do that now.
[77:23.56]Down the bone again.
[77:24.62]Let's go.
[77:34.39]So what's left?
[77:34.89]I'm going to have to... Because this is the end of this one, right?
[77:38.55]There's nowhere else to go from here.
[77:39.63]So four and two are both completely done.
[77:46.21]All of world four, all of world two.
[77:49.64]I have one more to do in World 1.
[77:53.58]Just look.
[77:55.20]Yeah, this one is done, right?
[77:59.96]This one is also done.
[78:01.59]No, it's not.
[78:02.61]I got 3-3, 1-3, and 5-2.
[78:06.57]We're moving.
[78:10.89]We are moving.
[78:11.55]So, okay, I don't know what any of these things even do.
[78:19.16]I need to take a look and see what these are.
[78:21.40]The Gray Demon Soul.
[78:23.56]Storm Demon Soul.
[78:24.72]I want to see what this actually is worth.
[78:29.64]Storm Demon Soul.
[78:31.77]And should I just crush it?
[78:38.03]You get something called the Morian Blade.
[78:43.71]Oh, damn.
[78:44.27]What is this?
[78:48.15]This looks fucking pretty cool.
[78:50.76]Okay, I can get this with the claymore.
[78:54.80]I can make the morian blade.
[78:58.50]So essentially with that, but yeah, it's just like the sharp souls.
[79:04.38]I think I'm going to crush it.
[79:05.44]That's one of those things where you put on morian blade, you put on that ring, and when you're below 30% health, you do 60% more damage with that weapon.
[79:14.28]So, you put on that ring, you put on that sword, and you do, like, fucking 120% more damage.
[79:21.67]I'm not sure I want it.
[79:27.99]I'll hold on to it.
[79:29.23]Because I don't, like, need to... I'm good with souls right now.
[79:32.60]I'm good with level ups.
[79:35.00]Let me get vitality to 30.
[79:37.00]I'm okay with that.
[79:43.61]30 vitality.
[79:44.29]Too many numbers.
[79:49.88]All right.
[79:51.06]Let's do 3-3.
[79:51.44]Let me just deposit some shit.
[79:55.22]So I don't run into any problems.
[79:57.34]Get rid of all this.
[80:00.52]All these shards.
[80:06.90]Am I crazy, or is there more... Are there more shards in this game and chunks in this game than any of the other ones?
[80:12.96]I don't remember there being this many.
[80:16.04]Hitless.
[80:20.46]Hitless Uchi Katana.
[80:21.96]I don't know if that was Dex, maybe.
[80:24.76]I have a lot of useless arrows.
[80:28.16]I'm not going to use these for any reason right now.
[80:35.00]Oh, you know, maybe I should.
[80:37.86]Yeah, I'm gonna take, because there's a million scenarios that I've been in where it's like, oh, you need to shoot a guy with a bow.
[80:42.52]Remember when I was freaking out about those spear enemies last time?
[80:45.90]I was having a literal meltdown on stream.
[80:49.48]So, just for that random scenario, just, like, compound bow, right?
[80:57.02]Let's just take this compound bow and just a shitload of just shitty who-cares arrows.
[81:02.62]Or, like, these.
[81:03.12]We are...
[81:16.59]No, I actually don't need to equip it right now.
[81:17.93]Wait, make sure I can actually use this.
[81:24.73]I can, right?
[81:25.21]Alright, let's headshot the statue.
[81:31.72]Okay, sure.
[81:32.50]I can use it.
[81:32.96]I'm going to unequip it so I don't have any burden.
[81:39.96]Alright, let's do it.
[81:46.88]1, 4.
[81:49.33]3, 3.
[81:51.27]Let's go for 3, 3.
[81:57.21]Patch is dead.
[81:58.31]Restart.
[81:59.29]A storm ruler for range?
[82:06.25]The storm ruler is way too heavy.
[82:07.15]I'm already carrying this gigantic thing.
[82:14.05]It's not worth it.
[82:18.06]Not really, that is.
[82:24.66]I should go online.
[82:27.52]I wish I could.
[82:28.26]I can't be online.
[82:29.49]It sucks.
[82:36.35]I have too many souls.
[82:41.38]I think... What is happening here?
[82:48.43]Random cutscene.
[82:55.95]Uh... Okay.
[83:01.80]Inside the courtroom.
[83:03.24]The cathedral.
[83:09.78]Am I on, like, bus... Bus rush mode?
[83:12.44]Is this boss rush mode right now?
[83:15.16]This is three bosses in a row.
[83:25.49]That's a lot of chairs.
[83:26.67]What?
[83:36.48]Three buses in a row.
[83:39.08]How could you be late to your doctor's appointment when you got three buses?
[83:41.79]That don't happen.
[83:47.03]Fuck.
[83:54.01]That's just that goofy thing from Dark Souls.
[83:56.89]The goofy tornado, like, mutton chop head.
[84:06.88]Everybody has this on PvP.
[84:08.20]Everybody wears that stupid tornado head.
[84:14.30]So, it's just a boss.
[84:16.14]I thought that was him.
[84:17.10]I was like, why is that him and why does he turn into a spider?
[84:32.29]So maybe that was just a cutscene to show you that that was what that thing was?
[84:37.75]That looked like an invader.
[84:38.69]That was a red phantom.
[84:47.86]I thought that was him.
[84:48.90]Seriously, I had my heart stopped.
[84:52.14]I was certain it was him.
[84:55.43]I saw the red outline, and I'm just like... I really should go back and level up, though.
[85:06.83]What do I need?
[85:07.95]20,000?
[85:08.53]I'm gonna go back and level up.
[85:09.51]There's no sense in, like, losing 20,000 souls.
[85:12.09]Especially if he's, like, up the stairs.
[85:15.35]Goddammit, I'm in trouble.
[85:32.65]Sorry, dude.
[85:33.23]Like, come on.
[85:36.91]Go online.
[85:37.61]Why doesn't anyone want to go online?
[85:44.62]Go online.
[85:45.16]Go online.
[85:45.66]Go online.
[85:46.10]Go online.
[85:46.46]Why?
[85:46.60]Go online.
[85:55.32]Go online.
[85:58.05]Does the encounter change if I go online?
[86:00.19]Okay, I'm gonna go... Let me just sell.
[86:04.60]I need... I'm gonna level up.
[86:06.96]It's an online boss?
[86:12.56]What?
[86:16.10]It's a PvP boss.
[86:21.57]Nobody's playing this game right now.
[86:23.21]What?
[86:23.39]What?
[86:24.63]You guys want me to go do the PvP boss with like the the 19 other people that are playing Demon's Souls right now?
[86:31.23]That are any of them even here?
[86:39.27]So somebody's saying we're playing it, but are you at the same spot?
[86:47.25]So many people playing this but not right now.
[86:53.56]Fine.
[86:53.78]Well, if that's the case, then log on.
[86:56.37]I will take one of you guys on if you want to do a PvP fight in the PvP boss room with the PvP trinket.
[87:02.55]How much is it to level up once?
[87:04.49]And then I'll, like, connect to the internet.
[87:06.11]Um...
[87:15.57]Shit I need all right.
[87:17.57]I'm just breaking the stupid demon soul thing.
[87:20.15]I don't care about the dumb axe I think that's just just barely what I need Yeah, I don't care Just barely not even there god damn it ah I gotta go kill like hold on let me just kill like three skeletons.
[87:37.04]Oh
[87:48.35]Wait, which one of these was the spear?
[87:51.29]The silver demon saw, right?
[87:54.51]No.
[87:57.17]Alright, who cares?
[87:58.71]Let me just kill like three skeletons.
[88:05.00]Get your spears ready.
[88:07.64]Go ahead, bring on a spear.
[88:10.10]Do it.
[88:12.70]You do understand that I have the dragon bone crusher.
[88:15.78]I'm going to R1 you, and you're going to instantly die.
[88:19.95]Bring your spear.
[88:25.21]I don't have to go online.
[88:26.03]I'll fight just a random phantom.
[88:30.87]I'll make it interesting.
[88:31.63]If this is the only time I'm going to play this game, I might as well try to fight one of you guys.
[88:41.09]I think you'll just clear this little zone.
[88:43.07]Come on, slide down.
[88:45.25]Do the thing that you want to do.
[88:47.01]I'm getting 25.
[88:51.81]25.
[88:51.83]That'll be it.
[88:52.43]Come on.
[88:52.65]Da-da-da.
[88:52.97]Come here, you.
[89:02.06]And then come here, you.
[89:19.02]okay level up the next boss is twitch chat okay I mean I'll go I'm gonna have to go back offline after I'm done with this and should I level my strength past 40. should I go to like 50 or should I just at this point
[89:45.60]Just get like 30-30 endurance and vitality.
[89:48.86]Or like 35 vitality.
[89:51.70]I don't think I really care that much.
[89:52.84]Because this thing doesn't... It has B scaling, but this... I would... If I were playing this game by myself, it would do 30-30-40.
[90:01.23]Or like 35-25-40.
[90:01.45]So the world might be mended.
[90:17.50]Mmm... Yeah, no more strength.
[90:23.04]If you win... If I win, you'll eat your hat.
[90:26.87]I'm gonna play it safe.
[90:27.59]I wanna go Endurance again.
[90:28.79]I'm just... I have a heavy fucking weapon.
[90:32.15]Being able to swing or dodge one time after swinging once or twice is a huge deal.
[90:36.45]Okay, uh, I'm gonna go online.
[90:39.24]So, give me a moment.
[90:40.44]Let me just... I gotta quit.
[90:44.06]I'll be right back in two seconds.
[90:47.47]And then we'll fight somebody in chat.
[90:49.37]So, give me a moment.
[90:52.33]Luck or endurance.
[90:56.38]Is luck as important in this game than any of the other ones?
[91:02.24]I'm going to go back.
[91:03.14]I love how I have to use the PlayStation Move controller to go online.
[91:10.24]Because my DualShock 4 doesn't know I'm here.
[91:18.65]No, I'm not peeing.
[91:19.31]I'm still here.
[91:20.05]I'm right here.
[91:22.11]If Twitch chat wins, I have to lose the Bone Crusher.
[91:26.29]No.
[91:29.63]Why would I do that?
[91:35.53]I've been putting all my investment into the Bone Crusher.
[91:38.41]I'm not going to do that.
[91:39.63]Okay, let's get back into Demon's Souls.
[91:46.56]Yes.
[91:47.00]No!
[91:47.42]What do you mean?
[91:49.33]I'm not going to do that.
[91:50.23]I've been building this character for this item.
[91:54.84]The big, heavy, super strength weapon is the one I'm using it.
[91:59.70]You want me to take it off?
[92:03.86]Or I have to dab on stream.
[92:05.10]So if I lose, I lose the item that I'm comfortable using right now.
[92:10.05]And if I win, I have to dab on stream.
[92:12.33]Where's my victory?
[92:13.83]That's not a victory for me.
[92:19.73]I don't see where I come out on top of that.
[92:31.17]Why would I do that?
[92:35.43]Fucking dabbing.
[92:41.62]The only time I ever dab is when I spill wine on a couch.
[92:49.23]You grab a little bit of baking soda and seltzer water.
[92:52.41]And you dab it a little.
[92:53.45]You know, you press, you blot, you dab.
[92:56.53]And it'll take care of it.
[92:57.79]Alright.
[93:06.68]Load game.
[93:08.08]Logging into the server.
[93:09.04]Please refrain from disconnecting.
[93:10.46]Welcome to the online mode.
[93:11.88]Here we go.
[93:20.33]Hey, thanks Styx.
[93:21.05]Renegade again for the $5.
[93:22.75]Imagine someone having a heart attack and dying while someone was trying to perform CPR.
[93:27.20]The body disintegrates and all that's left is old spice deodorant.
[93:30.98]What are you talking about?
[93:35.71]What?
[93:36.57]What?
[93:37.19]What?
[93:38.55]Oh, you're talking about, like, if somebody, like, when I kill somebody in the game.
[93:41.99]Okay, I get it.
[93:43.41]I thought you were talking about, like, in real life.
[93:44.84]You are talking about in real life.
[93:47.20]Whatever.
[93:51.44]Ugly superhero, thanks for the bits.
[93:53.78]Jeremy, what's my opinion on Monster Hunter World?
[93:55.56]It's coming out.
[93:56.48]I, look, let me tell you something.
[93:58.78]I cannot wait for that game to come out.
[94:01.18]I didn't really, I was like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[94:02.76]The game seems kind of fun.
[94:04.90]But when I heard that it was coming out early... That game's coming out like two and a half months, three months early.
[94:13.52]And it's gonna be super.
[94:15.10]It's coming out on PC.
[94:16.68]It's like... That is gonna be so much fun.
[94:26.23]Black screen?
[94:26.73]What are you talking about?
[94:29.33]It's there.
[94:32.25]All right, Twitch chat.
[94:33.75]Hopefully, let's go.
[94:36.43]Somebody come my way?
[94:40.88]Come queue up to the encounter.
[94:41.98]I'll give you a minute.
[94:42.60]You've had a minute to get there.
[94:45.00]There's almost 1,900 people here.
[94:47.22]Chances are maybe one of you can come here.
[94:50.22]I'm ready for you at this point.
[94:54.48]So if I lose, I have to dab on stream.
[94:56.22]And if I win, I have to dab on stream.
[94:57.84]Whoa, I can't wait.
[95:01.93]Can't wait to R1 and win.
[95:04.81]What do I actually get if I win?
[95:07.36]Like, you guys have all these stipulations for me.
[95:09.22]What happens when I win?
[95:11.38]What happens?
[95:17.32]What do I get?
[95:23.54]Those stakes are way too high for me.
[95:26.61]I better get something fucking incredible.
[95:29.64]If I'm gonna agree to dab on stream if I lose... Are you serious?
[95:36.39]I had better get, like, a new car.
[95:42.05]You know what I mean?
[95:42.55]I better get... You better give me, like, a new house.
[95:45.85]That's how high those stakes are.
[95:51.74]We have to dab back.
[95:59.72]Go on, do that little spray.
[96:07.76]I hate how you can't be staggered.
[96:13.83]That's why you're the one- What's going on?
[96:21.61]Didn't we already do this?
[96:28.01]Huh?
[96:30.80]Did somebody like invade the game already?
[96:32.64]Is that why it's doing this?
[96:33.86]Someone's been summoned?
[96:36.06]Are we gonna get to see him?
[96:36.96]Wait a minute.
[96:40.48]Is this what's actually happening?
[96:48.16]No, it's just the same guy with the tornado head, right?
[96:59.07]The Lord of Chat.
[97:07.90]And just my luck, one of you guys has played this game a hundred times.
[97:10.98]And you know, like, the dogshit cheese strategy.
[97:14.64]The one that's like they didn't patch.
[97:16.68]This game's never had a patch.
[97:18.86]And you're gonna do that to me.
[97:20.12]You're gonna do the thing that was never patched.
[97:22.94]And you're gonna instantly kill me.
[97:24.28]And here you come.
[97:25.60]Can't wait.
[97:30.10]Black Phantom Warvoid has invaded.
[97:31.86]Well, give me a second.
[97:32.88]Don't fight me here.
[97:34.45]That's not fair.
[97:36.01]Where is he?
[97:37.49]He's right behind me.
[97:43.95]Huh?
[97:45.43]Why is he invisible?
[97:48.03]Does he have like an invisibility ring?
[97:49.45]What the fuck is going on here?
[97:52.27]Why does he have an invisibility ring?
[97:55.90]What?
[97:57.32]Is he on the stairs?
[97:58.26]Where is he?
[98:04.61]Okay, I'm going in the fog.
[98:09.37]Is this him?
[98:13.42]Wait, is this a guy in Twitch chat right now?
[98:20.92]I don't know.
[98:21.90]Is it?
[98:23.16]Prove that you're a person before I fight you.
[98:26.44]You need to prove that you're a person.
[98:28.54]Like, do a wave.
[98:29.63]Bow.
[98:30.19]Do anything.
[98:30.95]Do whatever you need to do.
[98:33.07]He has the dog bone.
[98:33.95]He has the same weapon.
[98:40.59]God damn it.
[98:48.12]Why is he a steak puff marshmallow man?
[98:50.84]What spell is this?
[98:54.90]Can I not hurt him?
[99:01.83]Alright, I can hurt him now.
[99:05.20]Oh, you dick.
[99:09.08]I'm not dabbing on stream.
[99:13.70]Fucking cheat, I don't even care.
[99:17.64]Get him!
[99:20.45]Oh, oh, oh!
[99:21.63]Who hit who?
[99:22.67]Who hit who?
[99:28.25]There's too many chairs in the way.
[99:29.25]Hold on, calm down.
[99:37.86]What is this spell he keeps doing?
[99:44.27]Fucking smash him in the head!
[99:51.14]It's like a warding spell.
[99:52.38]He's got like two eyes of Kill Rock.
[99:55.62]How do I get those?
[100:04.28]You have no honor.
[100:05.24]Dude, this guy has like all these fucking cool moves.
[100:12.71]All I have is the dog bone.
[100:13.87]It's not fair.
[100:32.21]What do I get?
[100:33.05]What do I get if I win?
[100:34.04]I get a new car, right?
[100:38.43]Get him!
[101:00.67]The guy had funny moves.
[101:04.19]What if I cheated?
[101:05.13]It's the boss fight.
[101:06.03]He gets extra health because he's a boss.
[101:13.49]Wait, did he heal too, but it didn't fill the bar up?
[101:18.44]That's so funny.
[101:19.32]I love it.
[101:19.68]What does it say?
[101:21.10]Use katanas on the next enemy.
[101:22.62]Okay, wait.
[101:23.10]Do I have to fight the guy up there?
[101:26.36]Yellow Demon Soul.
[101:31.07]What do you mean it didn't count?
[101:40.13]Hold on, I was... You tell me that I activated a fucking blood stain and that... Well, it looked like a red phantom.
[101:47.56]Like, it said somebody invaded me.
[101:49.60]And then a guy's behind me.
[101:51.24]Like, of course I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[101:53.02]Do I have to do anything with this guy?
[101:56.57]Victory dab.
[101:57.29]No!
[101:58.13]I said if I lose, then I dab.
[102:00.01]And I fucking didn't lose.
[102:01.29]I won.
[102:01.65]I don't think there's anything else up there.
[102:08.76]That first backstab just didn't make any sense, though.
[102:11.68]That was such bullshit.
[102:14.32]Yeah, fine.
[102:15.20]I'll dab on strength for you guys.
[102:16.32]I will.
[102:19.98]I'll dab on strength for you.
[102:22.30]I mean, you know, sometimes when you do something, I'm going to do the dab that I know, the dab that I want to do.
[102:33.27]Got a little bit of a coffee spill here.
[102:42.41]Let me just take care of it.
[102:43.33]Make sure you don't see my lower body.
[102:48.89]Okay, sit here.
[102:49.83]Let's dab on spring.
[102:54.10]Cooling that up a little bit.
[102:57.04]Razor.
[103:14.41]What's that one?
[103:14.99]Oh, you're tapped!
[103:19.73]I think I broke something, hold on.
[103:24.03]What is this?
[103:32.13]No, it's alright.
[103:35.27]It wasn't important.
[103:36.01]It was just a bottle.
[103:38.48]Fucking glass went everywhere.
[103:42.96]Not even a real dab?
[103:43.80]What are you talking about?
[103:44.50]I guess it was.
[103:51.89]If you want to try to lecture me on what a correct dab is, you might need to evaluate what you're saying.
[104:01.20]You might need to evaluate that.
[104:13.18]Still online.
[104:17.94]Did the music change in here?
[104:23.28]Somebody's like playing an organ now.
[104:28.90]Okay, that's weird.
[104:46.96]You know when you go into the piano store, or you go into Radio Shack, and you walk over to the keyboard that's on display, and you just play chords, and pretend you know how to play the keyboard, to impress the random fucking people in the store?
[105:00.39]Why do you care about that?
[105:01.51]Why do we do that?
[105:03.76]I walk up to it, and I play a couple of chords.
[105:05.50]Yeah, I know, a couple of chords.
[105:09.12]Somebody's in a Radio Shack right now.
[105:20.07]Dude, stop it.
[105:21.03]We know you can't really play the piano.
[105:23.27]Stop it.
[105:33.25]Okay, what?
[105:36.70]More fucking Halloween shit, man.
[105:38.94]Why is this turning into a Halloween stream?
[105:40.78]Alright.
[105:42.02]I've been everywhere, except I gotta do five.
[105:45.26]I've not done five.
[105:49.02]Five, two.
[105:50.42]I got all of five to do, unfortunately.
[105:52.52]And we're going back here, so.
[106:00.43]Didn't put this on.
[106:01.43]You guys know that.
[106:02.57]Why is it here?
[106:05.10]Alright, this is Poison and Plague.
[106:12.87]Okay, we're going back to Poison Land.
[106:14.53]5-2.
[106:17.57]Let's go.
[106:32.70]Oh god, somebody gave a lot of money.
[106:34.56]Hold on a minute.
[106:36.69]Die troll, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[106:38.12]Jerma, you played like a scrub in that last battle, but take my money anyway for your victory.
[106:41.96]What?
[106:42.08]What, because I didn't have, like, the protection spell?
[106:46.30]I didn't have the Eye of Kilrog?
[106:48.42]And I didn't... And he has probably a more upgraded bone than me.
[106:53.11]You have to equalize.
[106:54.69]And that means eating grass.
[106:55.91]So thank you for the 10 bucks.
[106:57.81]Warvoid!
[106:58.45]There's Warvoid.
[107:00.41]There he is.
[107:00.83]5 bucks from Warvoid.
[107:03.58]Uh, thanks for the fight.
[107:04.66]So glad you're playing this game.
[107:06.72]P.S.
[107:07.04]Those backstabs made no sense.
[107:09.32]Dabs.
[107:10.52]Oh, yeah.
[107:11.36]That first backstab was outrageous.
[107:13.75]Absolutely outrageous.
[107:16.19]You did not deserve to lose that fight.
[107:19.39]But, you know, the gods smiled upon me and I didn't have to dab on spring.
[107:23.89]Anyways, thanks a lot, man.
[107:25.25]It was fun to play.
[107:26.01]I'm glad that, like, I actually got to do that the way it was intended.
[107:30.58]Uh, Amau...
[107:32.83]Or a male, a male Gardevoir.
[107:35.51]Okay, I was going to call you like Amale.
[107:38.67]A male Gardevoir, thank you for the bits.
[107:41.29]This is bits towards the new car.
[107:45.27]Thank you.
[107:46.53]Edgemont gave 50 bucks.
[107:50.61]Victory bits.
[107:51.81]I was hoping you'd lose and ditch the dog bone crusher or dab.
[107:57.85]Well, thank you, Edgemont, for the $50.
[107:59.31]5,000 bits.
[108:03.09]That is a lot of money.
[108:05.03]You are a special superstar.
[108:10.53]And it... It shocks me every day that somebody wants to give me that much money.
[108:17.29]But I do appreciate it and love you nonetheless.
[108:20.10]So thank you so much for your contribution.
[108:25.10]Let me touch your bum.
[108:25.70]Thanks for the $3.
[108:26.04]Rebio, thanks for the $2.
[108:29.15]Spooky, thank you for the $1.
[108:30.91]This is for the new car for all these guys, prize money.
[108:36.53]And man4241, thanks for the $1.50.
[108:37.75]You guys rock.
[108:38.11]Thank you so much.
[108:38.81]Let's do 5-2.
[108:39.25]The sludge hallway.
[108:40.71]I put off 5 so much.
[109:01.32]I just don't like the whole poison puke.
[109:05.57]You know, stuffy nose area.
[109:07.25]That's all this is.
[109:09.07]This is just the inside of somebody's nose when they have a cold.
[109:11.43]You guys have seen Osmosis Jones?
[109:14.78]That's what we're doing right now.
[109:16.76]This guy has the flu.
[109:26.62]All right, we got down there.
[109:27.96]Hit drop and grab that item, but let's not do anything crazy first.
[109:36.08]What is that on the ground?
[109:39.38]We're doing shield.
[109:40.21]I'm getting the shield.
[109:40.93]Can I walk over this?
[109:44.87]All right.
[109:47.73]Looks like we do have to go down.
[109:50.83]So I'm going to get that item that's down here.
[109:56.51]Lotus, of course.
[110:00.65]Oh boy.
[110:01.17]I already know I'm not going to like this part.
[110:12.08]I still got a backstab on you.
[110:14.34]How the hell did that happen?
[110:21.20]There's like a mustache enemy over there.
[110:22.68]Oh no.
[110:26.75]Oh, no.
[110:29.23]Not this shit.
[110:30.07]I can't dodge in here.
[110:36.52]Myrden Hammer.
[110:40.52]Oh, lord.
[110:41.00]It's doing it again.
[110:44.62]And I'm poisoned.
[110:48.51]Do I actually have to log out and log back in again?
[110:50.85]That's such a pain in the ass.
[110:55.11]You know, it's because it's loading something.
[110:56.45]It's saving the game.
[110:57.27]Is he in the top right?
[110:58.77]Maybe if I could just, like, wait and let it do its thing.
[111:08.44]It's constantly saving the game for some reason.
[111:10.60]I don't know why.
[111:11.14]Let's take a look at that.
[111:16.45]It's a D in scaling.
[111:18.71]Mirrodin Hammer.
[111:21.83]It's a pull weapon.
[111:24.86]That's kind of cool.
[111:30.35]God damn it.
[111:33.53]Stop this.
[111:37.03]Do I actually have to quit out and come back?
[111:41.23]I do.
[111:41.55]I have to.
[111:42.07]There's no getting around this.
[111:44.03]I gotta go offline.
[111:46.17]That's unfortunate.
[111:48.13]Give me a second.
[111:59.77]Unfortunately First it was just stuck in the so that's what's happening anytime that the frame shit is going on and the audio goes like It's because the game is like stuck saving the game If it's consistently constantly saving it means someone's attempting to invade you where were they What's up with that?
[112:24.71]Yeah, sorry.
[112:27.11]RIP online mode.
[112:28.29]Sorry, guys.
[112:29.35]No online mode.
[112:31.76]It just can't work.
[112:33.66]It's just all screwed up.
[112:34.70]It's okay, though.
[112:46.13]Here we go.
[112:48.13]Come on back.
[112:51.81]Disable the connection, please.
[112:53.75]Thank you very much.
[112:54.65]Sign out.
[112:57.45]We go back to Demon's Souls.
[113:05.82]Nice Popeye impression.
[113:07.06]When did I do a... I did a Popeye impression?
[113:17.73]I don't remember doing that.
[113:20.92]Thank you, Ivory, for the $1.30.
[113:23.14]A Twitch bit history of dabbing.
[113:26.48]Dabbing is part of a... I don't want to read the history of dabbing.
[113:32.63]This is like a paragraph about dabbing.
[113:36.65]No, no dabbing like Wikipedia article.
[113:42.84]Thank you, Ivory, for the $1.30.
[113:47.22]To properly dab, place your left arm outwards.
[113:49.18]Bend the elbow and allow your right arm to be parallel with your left one.
[113:52.12]Be sure to also put, like... I just did it.
[113:54.26]I did it already.
[114:01.61]What did I think of the new Red Dab Redemption 2 trailer?
[114:04.53]I thought it was pretty good.
[114:09.58]Dab lore.
[114:12.14]God.
[114:13.18]Thank you, Tara, for the two bucks.
[114:16.70]Jeremy, your gameplay in that last section has me questioning that you didn't beat Dark Souls 3 by having a friend play it for you on stream.
[114:22.13]Good day.
[114:23.41]True.
[114:24.89]It actually happened.
[114:30.33]Also, thank you, King Roy.
[114:31.45]Comfy rain.
[114:32.03]Thank you, King Roy, for the bits.
[114:37.33]I gotta, like, piss again.
[114:39.91]I swear to God, when I drink... When I drink any coffee...
[114:45.71]I have to pee every 45 minutes.
[114:47.16]I don't know what it is.
[114:50.62]When I go to a convention, like if I go to PAX or E3 or something, it's the worst because I need coffee so badly when I go to cons or when I go to like events or anything like that.
[115:01.20]I need it so badly.
[115:02.86]You know the bathrooms at conventions?
[115:08.14]You gotta wait like in a line.
[115:15.03]I'm just going to progress.
[115:17.69]Having to wait in that PAX bathroom line every 45 minutes is not fun.
[115:23.28]I hear the mustaches.
[115:24.24]Just be careful.
[115:24.90]I don't know what they do.
[115:31.74]You can't dodge.
[115:34.79]The mustaches are not even worth killing, so... Where the hell do I need to go?
[115:38.59]I'm just going to go straight.
[115:39.91]All right.
[115:44.86]Wow, that just scared the shit out of me.
[115:46.56]I thought that was a monster in the game.
[115:50.86]I was like, why?
[115:56.28]I was like, did this game come out before the iPhone?
[115:58.22]I was like, wait, did they, who came out with the iPhone first?
[116:04.69]Was it, did FromSoftware make the iPhone text sound?
[116:07.53]I was like, no way.
[116:26.73]There we go.
[116:28.27]Cling ring is useless right now.
[116:33.22]Phone swamp monster.
[116:34.62]Yeah, the iPhone monster.
[116:38.16]Steve Jobs worked for From Software.
[116:46.81]Oh, that sucks.
[116:51.69]I'm just... I'm just... I guess I'm just gonna go in a straight line.
[116:59.62]Right?
[117:00.02]I mean... I think... I can deal with the poison for a little while.
[117:09.84]As long as it doesn't turn into plague.
[117:15.37]Uh, is this a way up?
[117:16.11]It's a way up to the left, but I see this.
[117:20.37]Yes, I see this, too.
[117:22.90]Ooh, what is this?
[117:23.96]I see this.
[117:25.60]I can see this.
[117:29.10]Oh, come on.
[117:30.24]Really?
[117:31.92]I see this.
[117:35.56]Up here?
[117:36.12]Can I walk up this?
[117:38.98]Oh, well.
[117:47.71]Holy shit!
[117:49.69]And I can't dodge!
[117:50.63]I can't- Take- I gotta take full moon grass here.
[118:00.68]Stop!
[118:01.38]Stop with the texting!
[118:02.18]God damn it.
[118:09.90]I just got- I just got cocky there.
[118:29.10]Alright.
[118:36.50]So, I need to go over here, right?
[118:38.30]Yes.
[118:39.76]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[118:42.46]Unknown soul.
[118:43.38]Royal lotus.
[118:45.78]There's a lot of items, but there's a fog gate here.
[118:48.38]I kind of want to do it.
[118:52.10]Just open it.
[118:55.48]And I'm gonna take the royal lotus.
[118:57.91]And then I should be able to reach- I gotta pee!
[119:03.59]Oh boy, I've gotta pee.
[119:10.68]Bugs.
[119:14.64]God fucking dammit.
[119:19.93]It's because I have to pee.
[119:22.52]Oh, I am just... Oh, come on.
[119:25.08]I gotta stop.
[119:25.64]I gotta pee.
[119:26.60]This is dumb.
[119:28.36]I'm about to seriously pee into the coffee cup.
[119:30.92]Do you think I'm kidding?
[119:33.33]If that wasn't a bannable offense from Twitch, I would pee into this coffee cup right now.
[119:46.03]Okay, I hope I'm safe.
[119:51.57]Am I safe right here?
[119:52.91]I think so, right?
[119:55.16]There's nothing in eye's reach.
[119:56.38]It's going to be quick.
[119:56.94]Okay, I'll be right back.
[123:08.49]Okay, I'm back.
[123:09.37]Good thing I have the regen ring on.
[123:10.83]I'm just realizing this.
[123:12.69]I've just been sitting here dying.
[123:16.41]Alright, uh... I need to go back around.
[123:25.23]Do I have to go all the way back around?
[123:26.45]Well, that sucks if that's the case.
[123:29.13]It is the case, isn't it?
[123:32.08]Goddammit.
[123:38.65]The poison just ran out.
[123:44.95]Dark moon grass.
[123:48.60]There's like a whole colony over there.
[123:49.96]I don't even want to know what it is yet.
[123:59.44]I know.
[124:03.04]Um, hold on.
[124:04.88]There's so much shit over here.
[124:07.76]I got invaded.
[124:08.50]Well, that would be remarkable.
[124:13.27]Considering I'm not on the internet.
[124:18.63]That would be a feat of strength I could never even imagine somebody doing.
[124:26.15]Since I'm all the way over here, I might as well just do this and look at it.
[124:32.90]Oh my god.
[124:40.66]Why was that not a backstab?
[124:42.67]That's not a backstab!
[124:45.31]And I- I gotta- I can't!
[124:48.08]Oh!
[125:05.39]How is that?
[125:05.95]I can't backstab those guys.
[125:09.25]Couldn't backstab big guys until Bloodborne.
[125:12.05]Oh, god damn it.
[125:15.31]Well, I'm absolutely taking one of these because I'm not doing that shit again.
[125:18.45]Fuck.
[125:25.00]Oh, boy, this sucks.
[125:26.68]Okay, I can't fuck it up.
[125:27.82]This place is not good.
[125:30.32]This is such a rage-inducing area.
[125:34.27]Better get out of here.
[125:35.19]I better get on with it.
[125:39.41]Can I just drop down, considering it's water?
[125:42.84]It's sludge, right?
[125:43.64]So it'll break my fall.
[125:47.08]That's the theory, right?
[125:49.13]Will the sludge break my fall?
[126:13.89]I had 2,700 souls.
[126:15.47]That's fucking nothing.
[126:22.61]When has it ever been like that?
[126:23.79]I don't know.
[126:24.65]You guys have seen me fall from immense heights and take a centimeter of damage in this game.
[126:32.20]Not even 35 minutes ago, I jumped from... Stop that.
[126:36.28]Stop talking to me.
[126:37.02]I think I got my zero souls.
[126:43.07]I'm getting jumpscared by my own iPhone.
[126:54.35]Will this 8-inch pool of sludge protect me?
[126:57.20]I mean... So I can do it from here.
[127:02.66]I can do it from here.
[127:03.66]I know I can.
[127:06.30]See?
[127:07.72]Look at how tiny that was.
[127:11.16]That should have been at least half my health.
[127:17.78]I'm poisoned.
[127:21.82]Can I put on two regenerator... I can't even say the word.
[127:26.87]Regenerator.
[127:27.69]Regenerator rings.
[127:34.05]Let me take a humanity.
[127:34.85]Because I'm back here now.
[127:36.51]And this is going to be unbearable without it.
[127:49.94]Let's go back around the fog gate.
[127:51.08]It's like, over here, right?
[128:00.66]Mm-hmm.
[128:04.19]Whoops.
[128:07.07]Yeah, the two refrigerator rings.
[128:14.45]Go on.
[128:18.75]Go on!
[128:22.38]There's a guy up here, right?
[128:23.86]He jumps out, you know?
[128:25.03]Go this way.
[128:29.59]Do I have any kids?
[128:31.07]No, I don't have any kids.
[128:36.84]Silent!
[128:38.22]Put the fucking phone on silent before I actually get scared about- from it again.
[128:48.84]There we are.
[128:50.04]Around this way.
[128:50.85]Look at the huge guy.
[128:55.85]Is he aggro if I walk on this plank?
[128:57.79]No, he does not.
[128:58.91]Thank God.
[128:59.99]So, don't fall off this time.
[129:03.61]Play it smart.
[129:05.29]That fog gate was right there.
[129:06.75]Watch out for this.
[129:07.63]The dumb bugs.
[129:12.59]They're going to do this stupid spray thing and then kill him.
[129:21.54]Okay.
[129:22.66]That sure was fun.
[129:23.85]Do it again.
[129:26.63]Dead.
[129:31.49]Gotta be careful.
[129:34.71]This becomes tiny.
[129:37.37]More bugs.
[129:39.71]More than, actually, quite a few bugs.
[129:44.56]Dude, you know what I'm so happy does not exist in this game?
[129:49.46]the petrification the curse the thing that if you build up enough it instantly kills you boy am I happy that ain't in this game get them both come on
[130:19.02]Oh, these narrow ass corridors, these little stupid planks is not cool.
[130:25.14]I don't even know what he was gonna do, but whatever it was, I'm glad it didn't hit me.
[130:32.19]And I see somebody jumping from the left.
[130:34.25]There's a guy over here on the left.
[130:37.67]He pushes you and he pushes you.
[130:53.72]I don't want to do it again.
[130:54.80]Oh, god damn it.
[130:59.05]I smelled it.
[131:00.37]I could feel it from a mile away.
[131:02.81]But it doesn't matter.
[131:04.95]What was I going to do?
[131:05.73]Turn around and dodge?
[131:06.77]Freak out?
[131:07.33]No.
[131:07.75]He's going to just push you.
[131:10.13]The guy has a Pac-Man special move.
[131:12.59]Oh, god damn it.
[131:18.15]Just run.
[131:18.79]I don't want to do it.
[131:19.59]Just run and jump off the edge like I know I can right here.
[131:25.25]Go.
[131:27.25]Oh, boy.
[131:29.88]Don't fight anybody.
[131:35.52]Streamer gets... I'm gay.
[131:37.16]Yeah, the vial of defi... I can't even say the word.
[131:40.20]The defilement zone.
[131:48.04]Son of a gun.
[131:50.74]You know what I mean?
[131:52.21]Son of a gun.
[131:56.08]The Vial of Defilement is what I keep saying.
[132:03.17]That item is way too easy to get, apparently, so I'm going to get it.
[132:08.39]Going on this breadcrumb trail.
[132:14.70]The Vial of Defilement of Regenafrigeration.
[132:26.26]Oh, man.
[132:27.54]That's fucking funny.
[132:29.72]That's funny.
[132:38.11]I'm just... I'm getting led to... Broken Sword.
[132:40.31]Hey, remember how good of a... Hey, you know, I know what to do with the Broken Sword.
[132:49.18]Take, like, 16 million dollars and kick... No, that's the wrong game.
[132:53.40]Broken Age.
[132:53.96]Sorry.
[132:54.16]Okay.
[132:57.42]Who the fuck is this?
[132:59.76]Don't even give him a second.
[133:00.54]Don't even give them an opportunity.
[133:01.80]Crush him!
[133:04.84]Oh!
[133:05.44]I can't dodge in this area!
[133:13.35]Oh, I can't dodge.
[133:14.51]It's just muscle memory.
[133:18.57]It's just muscle memory at that point.
[133:20.87]And it's...
[133:32.49]It's just burned into my brain.
[133:33.59]You dodge, you hit, you... It's alright.
[133:40.19]It's okay.
[133:43.61]Tough but fair.
[133:45.29]Tough but fair.
[133:46.01]No, it's not.
[133:48.17]No, it's not at all.
[133:49.13]That guy jumped off from stage left and pushed me.
[133:54.63]What am I talking about?
[134:00.19]I'm gonna kill that person.
[134:01.25]This is a random invading NPC just walking around the swamp.
[134:06.28]Why are you here?
[134:07.78]Don't you have anything better to do?
[134:08.84]Alright, I'm taking another one of those things.
[134:23.01]I heard the thing breaking.
[134:25.49]Okay, take it.
[134:26.19]Come on.
[134:27.55]Stop it.
[134:28.09]Stop this.
[134:34.86]Okay.
[134:39.38]She lives here.
[134:43.28]Well, whatever.
[134:44.52]At least I'm getting all the items, right?
[134:53.99]Legendary soul, okay.
[134:57.74]Over here.
[134:58.10]I'm gonna find her again.
[134:59.30]The thing is, I don't have the breadcrumb trail anymore.
[135:03.97]I don't know where that even was.
[135:06.77]I was going by the Hansel and Gretel trail.
[135:10.65]I don't have it anymore, so I don't know where I haven't been.
[135:12.91]Over here?
[135:26.74]I think it was over here.
[135:27.74]Yeah, there it is.
[135:28.38]I can see my... I can see my body on the map.
[135:31.30]Alright, let's kill this lady.
[135:34.68]What do you get for killing this person?
[135:39.85]Where are you?
[135:44.19]Where is she?
[135:46.15]Why am I dodging?
[135:47.17]No.
[135:57.87]Oh my god.
[135:58.79]Oh my god.
[136:06.82]I thought those were my legs moving in the swamp.
[136:15.02]You know, I'm blaming the guy that pushed me off the cliff.
[136:18.24]Without that, this doesn't happen.
[136:22.32]What is my world tendency right now?
[136:25.80]Like neutral?
[136:30.14]Seriously.
[136:31.98]Oh, this is so... It's... I'm gonna die from the... I would like one of you fucking Demon's Souls scholars to explain that.
[136:47.74]What's with my back?
[136:49.00]What's wrong with my back?
[136:49.74]I broke my back.
[136:51.60]Alright, one of you Demon's Souls scholars tell me what the fuck happened there.
[136:55.12]Huh?
[136:57.66]Go ahead, tell me.
[136:59.54]Explain it.
[137:00.60]What happened?
[137:02.04]I'm all ears.
[137:15.65]So how is that fall any different than the first one?
[137:22.70]Good, that's like the shortcut.
[137:30.33]You fell off the cliff.
[137:36.15]See, you guys, I don't even hate this area.
[137:38.66]This is a comedy zone.
[137:44.40]If I didn't see the comedy in this, I'd be very mad right now.
[137:47.80]There's a lot of comedy in this place.
[137:49.18]Remember, this is the first time they ever did anything like this.
[137:55.70]So, they put all their funny comedy bits here for the first time.
[138:00.61]And then they just made it mean and not fun.
[138:02.79]So, I'm okay with this.
[138:09.17]Okay.
[138:10.83]God damn it.
[138:17.66]One at a time.
[138:18.40]I don't want to aggro that guy.
[138:22.26]So, we're going to go this way.
[138:26.83]I'm going to fight that lady.
[138:28.09]I'm going to beat her.
[138:30.35]She's over here.
[138:33.05]What kind of comedy would I consider this comb?
[138:36.19]Huh?
[138:40.06]What did I just say?
[138:41.70]What kind of comedy would I consider this comb?
[138:44.74]There she is.
[138:45.26]You can't fucking fool me now.
[138:46.86]Let's play it smart.
[139:00.50]I need to run.
[139:12.40]I don't think this lady is possible to beat unless you get the... No, okay.
[139:19.55]You guys know... If you can't dodge... And she has zero stamina...
[139:31.31]She has infinite stamina.
[139:33.53]So you have to be the first one to hit her.
[139:35.91]I have to swing my sword and kill her before she does anything.
[139:38.74]She has to die in two swings, or it's impossible to beat.
[139:44.42]Do I have, like, a ring I need to be putting on or something?
[139:46.44]Like, what the fuck is going on?
[139:56.09]I... I... What are you... What?
[140:01.41]Parry!
[140:01.97]You want me to parry the girl with the gigantic meat cleaver?
[140:08.01]It's gonna go right through me.
[140:18.66]The thief's ring?
[140:27.95]Okay, at least in the future Souls games, you could fucking dodge.
[140:32.89]They took away your ability, your one ability to make sure you don't get hit in this game.
[140:37.67]Even with the shield, you're going to get crushed.
[140:40.91]I got a storm ruler here.
[140:42.03]I might as well just shoot her with fucking arrows.
[140:44.65]You know what?
[140:45.60]I don't care.
[140:46.26]I'm moving on.
[140:50.88]The only way I see beating her with my current character is by holding R2 and burying the sword in her head and then doing it again immediately and hoping that she's dead.
[141:00.19]That's the only way.
[141:13.82]I gotta queue it up correctly and I bury her into the ground and then I do it again.
[141:26.40]I'm not even progression locked out of this part of the game.
[141:30.12]I gotta do it.
[141:30.72]I've gotta get it.
[141:31.48]I'm gonna try this one last time.
[141:32.74]This is the last time I'm gonna try this.
[141:35.34]I have to bury this thing in her head before she gets over here.
[141:39.25]She's gonna walk at me.
[141:40.35]It's gonna be really slow.
[141:41.25]I just have to time it correctly.
[141:45.01]You almost fucked this whole thing up for me.
[141:48.61]Thank god I saw you.
[141:55.29]Guys, this is not the fucking time for this.
[142:01.21]I don't have time for this shit.
[142:02.43]Okay.
[142:03.43]Come on.
[142:08.80]Here we go.
[142:11.18]I'm gonna hit her and fucking kill her in one swing.
[142:14.30]Where is she?
[142:16.82]Where is she?
[142:18.00]She's right here somewhere.
[142:18.80]Come on.
[142:19.26]Where?
[142:20.22]I need to be able to queue this up.
[142:21.22]Where are you?
[142:23.36]Where is she?
[142:23.94]Why is she not here?
[142:26.50]Where is this lady?
[142:28.52]Why are you not right here?
[142:29.40]I want to show you something.
[142:53.67]This is how I'm sitting here.
[143:06.31]I wanted you guys to know.
[143:07.27]That's what it looked like.
[143:08.33]Good thing I used the fire.
[143:18.61]Alright.
[143:19.09]I'm going to say she's dead.
[143:20.28]I killed her.
[143:22.96]I win.
[143:27.20]That was a fun fight.
[143:28.00]I got her.
[143:28.80]Oh my dear lord.
[143:29.94]Come on.
[143:30.24]Get ready.
[143:33.14]Here we go.
[143:34.16]This is for the marbles.
[143:35.80]This one's for all the marbles.
[143:36.72]I gotta get her riiiight now.
[143:40.60]I fucking failed.
[143:42.62]I fucking- Oh man, I'm guy- Oh god.
[143:49.72]Alright, move on from this stupid shit.
[143:52.62]Move the fuck on.
[143:56.06]I don't even care.
[143:56.58]She's not even gonna drop anything worth taking.
[143:59.19]I've spent like 30 minutes.
[144:01.97]on this stupid bitch and I don't know why I'm still here.
[144:08.32]I can't dodge and I can't block and I can't parry here because I don't even have a parry shield with me.
[144:13.52]Just go.
[144:14.20]Just fucking go.
[144:15.28]Just complete this.
[144:16.23]This is what happens.
[144:19.20]The bosses, the areas, no.
[144:21.58]I get stuck on like one stupid fucking enemy.
[144:24.66]One dumbass enemy that fucks up everything and I die like nine times to the one enemy inside of the fucking zone.
[144:35.13]I'm just walking by her.
[144:41.97]Oh, but I so badly want to crush her head like a bug.
[144:52.71]Comedy Zone.
[144:55.87]No, this shit's not comedy.
[144:59.00]This isn't comedy.
[145:00.80]That's not comedy.
[145:02.14]This shit... I have to, like, run around her.
[145:17.03]But then I'm not gonna have enough stamina.
[145:18.59]Okay, so if I run around her and wait and, like, okay, here we go.
[145:20.87]I gotta run around.
[145:22.25]Run around, run around.
[145:23.07]Oh, here she is.
[145:23.79]She just swung.
[145:24.44]Okay, hit her.
[145:25.96]Like, now I don't even have to... I can't even go anywhere.
[145:29.22]Oh, I'm like... I am Adam Sandler angry right now.
[145:37.37]Like, I am as mad as Adam Sandler is in Happy Gilmore.
[145:42.11]Yes, I'm pulling that old reference I made like the last year back.
[145:51.47]And take this shit, too.
[145:52.59]Take this... Take it.
[145:59.22]No more fucking around.
[146:00.28]Just get me out of here.
[146:01.04]I don't even have any souls.
[146:04.80]Just go.
[146:05.74]Get up the stairs.
[146:08.07]I gotta wrap around... Wait, no, no.
[146:09.29]I'm, like, going towards her again.
[146:11.05]Where was that area?
[146:15.63]No, she's gonna appear right here.
[146:18.60]Where... I like... I like... I absentmindedly just ran towards where she is.
[146:26.80]What a mistake.
[146:27.52]I'm just absentmindedly walking over here.
[146:31.31]Because I'm like so... so annoyed.
[146:33.77]Just use the storm roofer.
[146:40.77]No, no.
[146:41.19]Just let me progress through the level.
[146:43.35]I just gotta get through the level.
[146:47.46]We can come back another time and fight Meat Woman.
[146:55.73]Somebody's behind me.
[146:58.27]Isn't there?
[147:01.51]Yeah, there was, but thank God.
[147:03.11]Okay.
[147:10.50]Watch out for the push guy.
[147:11.52]Are you going to do anything or what?
[147:21.88]Fuck that stupid lady.
[147:23.75]Oh, just give me my dodge back.
[147:25.15]All right, push the push guys up here after these bugs.
[147:30.95]It's three bugs.
[147:31.69]Somebody do something.
[147:46.56]Watch out.
[147:53.83]Where does the guy come up from?
[147:54.99]I'm being so paranoid that it's going to... Move.
[147:59.84]Move my hands.
[148:01.26]Where is he?
[148:03.58]He's up a little bit further, right?
[148:07.16]There's a push guy before a push guy.
[148:08.93]The real push guy.
[148:10.79]Push guy one is right here.
[148:18.37]Here we go.
[148:19.73]Okay.
[148:23.21]They keep coming out.
[148:26.17]Is there a never-ending supply of these guys?
[148:28.97]God, I hope not.
[148:34.49]Okay, I think I'm safe.
[148:38.95]Better be.
[148:40.33]Oh my god!
[148:41.31]Did somebody else come in here?
[148:53.38]Holy shit, there's so many of them.
[148:59.92]Oh, man.
[149:00.84]Oh, man.
[149:10.18]Would you get down here, please?
[149:14.57]Can he... This one's not smart enough to jump, apparently.
[149:18.97]They actually are infinite.
[149:21.65]They don't ever stop coming out of this hole.
[149:27.16]Yeah, they're just spawning.
[149:29.02]Run!
[149:35.31]What did that do for me?
[149:41.03]So what the fuck is going on here?
[149:44.61]What do I do over here?
[149:45.37]I can drop down there.
[149:52.02]Christ This way Huh, this is gonna break Huh Am I supposed to go in here?
[150:08.88]Black turpentine
[150:25.09]So what... What's the point of doing this?
[150:28.81]To get the turpentine?
[150:29.69]Or am I, like, in a different part?
[150:31.25]Hold that for nothing.
[150:46.34]Okay.
[150:48.73]Uh... Well, I see something over there.
[151:02.39]Wow, that hurt my shield.
[151:05.67]Oh no.
[151:07.45]What does this mean?
[151:12.05]What's wrong with me?
[151:15.20]I thought I was dead.
[151:16.46]No, get off of me.
[151:22.72]What is it?
[151:23.12]What are they doing?
[151:23.86]I don't understand.
[151:24.46]Is this full of blood?
[151:30.65]You guys are in the stupidest fucking place.
[151:32.47]I can't hit you guys.
[151:34.07]Please.
[151:36.25]Get down here.
[151:37.74]I can't hit them.
[151:39.10]You know, you pick your battles.
[151:40.76]I'm picking to leave.
[151:42.62]I'm choosing to leave.
[151:49.58]What is up there?
[151:50.41]There's a big thing over there.
[152:01.07]Oh my fucking god.
[152:06.09]Oh my god.
[152:09.85]Okay, he dashed forward and that's the only reason why I hit him.
[152:21.94]Just get rid of this so I can heal.
[152:43.14]What are they doing?
[152:43.84]What are they on?
[152:47.48]Why would I get myself in the middle there?
[152:49.76]Can anyone tell me why I just did that?
[152:55.88]I walked in the middle.
[152:56.88]I was asking them to surround me.
[152:59.87]There's no item even there.
[153:00.85]I thought there was one.
[153:01.35]I thought there was an item in the middle of the dog pile.
[153:14.86]I think that's a fog gate.
[153:16.38]Oh, can I please get out of this misery?
[153:20.54]Yeah, it is a fog gate.
[153:24.84]End this misery.
[153:25.74]I think it's two of those guys.
[153:29.47]There's a way to go up there.
[153:33.57]Avoid these fucking idiots.
[153:34.91]I don't even care what the item is, whatever it is.
[153:36.75]Go around.
[153:41.15]What is that thing?
[153:42.87]What's wrong with this guy?
[153:47.72]My god, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[153:51.50]Oh No, no, no No, no, no, no go in the door.
[153:55.00]No, I don't care.
[153:55.78]Whatever it is.
[153:56.22]It's better than this It's not the boss.
[153:59.54]It's not the boss.
[154:02.24]Oh Which way where am I?
[154:03.50]Where am I?
[154:03.83]Where am I straight?
[154:06.35]Okay, I can fight him Three damage
[154:16.51]Are you telling me I can't dodge on this shit?
[154:19.88]I can't dodge on the fucking lily pads?
[154:22.92]Why?
[154:24.30]Why?
[154:25.50]Why Satan can I not do that?
[154:33.58]What is happening right now?
[154:35.12]You've got to be shitting me.
[154:38.20]Too many people.
[154:39.18]There's a whole baseball team.
[154:41.46]Oh.
[154:43.78]Oh.
[154:50.92]Huh?
[154:54.20]What is down here?
[154:59.68]Oh my god.
[155:07.75]Look at that.
[155:08.47]I want you to look up there.
[155:09.57]Look up there.
[155:10.71]Look up there and you tell me.
[155:13.49]What kind of fucked up world I'm living in right now.
[155:18.14]This is too much.
[155:20.04]Too many enemies.
[155:35.63]They all can't fit down.
[155:36.63]This is where we... Come on.
[155:38.23]Fuck you.
[155:39.39]Fuck you.
[155:43.03]Please don't have the fat guy fall down here.
[155:49.28]Okay, good.
[155:49.72]Come in here one by one.
[155:51.74]I don't care if I'm poisoned.
[155:52.70]Just don't obstruct my view.
[155:55.24]Throw a grenade.
[155:56.06]That's a frame rate, too.
[155:59.70]Fuck off.
[156:04.50]What a fucking slide jump.
[156:11.29]This is so bad.
[156:12.37]Please.
[156:14.23]Oh, man.
[156:14.83]How did I make it out of that one alive?
[156:16.45]I don't know.
[156:17.47]Can I please have my frames back?
[156:20.36]Enough.
[156:22.46]Enough.
[156:24.70]Enough.
[156:37.68]Oh, my God.
[156:38.54]Is there a... Are you even alive?
[156:48.73]I better beat this boss first fucking try, guys.
[156:51.05]Because, holy shit, good luck having me figure out this again.
[156:54.85]Are you kidding me?
[156:59.57]There's not a chance in hell.
[157:07.59]This camera is so awful.
[157:11.85]This is worse than Blighttown.
[157:13.89]Blighttown is a fun zone compared to this.
[157:20.11]I would vacation in Blighttown versus here.
[157:30.71]Is there a shortcut or anything?
[157:39.55]The camera is just always in a bad place.
[157:46.56]The guys just spawn out of nowhere.
[157:50.54]It has to be a shortcut.
[157:52.24]Everything is just the same fucking twigs.
[157:56.67]Everybody has their house made out of straw.
[158:03.21]Wow.
[158:08.79]I gotta take this really slowly.
[158:11.43]Because if there is a way to, like, get some kind of shortcut or something, like, I've got- I have to- I have to know where it is.
[158:16.46]I have to figure it out.
[158:32.48]Mm-hmm.
[158:36.10]Ugh.
[158:44.48]And there's gonna be some pushers, I know it.
[158:52.03]Down here?
[158:56.09]I don't know.
[159:03.70]I feel like I'm going the right way.
[159:06.86]Do not, do not pull this shit on me now.
[159:15.51]Be very very careful.
[159:18.81]You're gonna swing make it count.
[159:21.14]Make it count.
[159:22.30]Here we go.
[159:22.72]That's making it count.
[159:30.43]Watch out for guys jumping down.
[159:43.33]God.
[159:44.29]Oh, God, get over there quick before these fucking ants come to you!
[159:47.55]Get on the level ground.
[159:49.76]No!
[159:50.46]That lock-on just so badly fucked me!
[159:56.40]Don't- Nobody behind me, right?
[159:57.30]Oh, and I'm just- You gotta start to pay attention here.
[160:01.16]Jeremy!
[160:01.76]Jeremy, calm down.
[160:11.05]Holy shit.
[160:17.03]This place is so horrible, and you're telling me I got no shortcut to come back here.
[160:28.75]And there's more.
[160:30.35]There's a guy with a push, right?
[160:31.93]Push guy?
[160:38.43]There's more of this shit over here.
[160:54.42]I don't understand.
[160:55.04]Can I walk up here?
[160:58.91]I don't understand.
[160:59.51]Can I walk up this?
[161:01.95]If I had just dropped down there, you would have seen an unhappy baby.
[161:05.70]There's a guy coming.
[161:19.17]These guys all push.
[161:21.09]These guys all push.
[161:22.66]Oh boy.
[161:23.58]Why won't you die?
[161:31.16]You want to see an unhappy baby, you'll see it.
[161:42.91]I hope the boss for this area is stupidly easy.
[161:47.63]I hope it's a guy that just stands still.
[161:50.53]I got it.
[161:58.95]I got it.
[162:01.49]Oh, dear.
[162:02.75]I'm so relieved.
[162:07.70]Oh, wow.
[162:08.30]This is the beginning of the level.
[162:11.93]Thank God.
[162:12.75]Oh boy, my whole body feels... I could take a large bowel movement right now.
[162:22.59]Where's the boss?
[162:28.53]I gotta say, out of the whole game, this zone here, that was the worst.
[162:35.12]This was the worst.
[162:38.59]I'm shocked that I didn't die when I got, like, collapsed on by all those people.
[162:44.72]From here, where the hell is it?
[162:46.90]Could I have gone, like, down or right or left or something?
[162:51.14]Well, no longer afraid, so that's a good thing.
[162:53.22]I guess, uh... Not like this way, right?
[163:02.15]No?
[163:06.98]Um...
[163:08.55]Hmm.
[163:12.11]I don't know.
[163:20.58]I'm just gonna have to go back over here and explore the places that I freaked out at.
[163:26.86]Up there?
[163:29.48]Looks like it's possible.
[163:32.83]I see... Okay, there's... I haven't been down...
[163:37.34]But I'm not sure I need to go down there.
[163:38.96]I'm going to go up.
[163:44.90]Why am I going backwards?
[163:45.76]Because that was the beginning of the level.
[163:47.94]When I pushed the bridge over, that was the place where you start.
[163:58.60]Well, okay.
[163:59.50]I didn't check this out.
[164:01.83]Yeah, it's definitely over there.
[164:05.75]I would be surprised if it was not, like, up there.
[164:10.75]Or over here, or something.
[164:15.09]Okay.
[164:16.33]Think we're on the right track.
[164:17.37]Yes, we are.
[164:20.85]You're probably asking yourselves, hey, Matt, how can we get back up the right track?
[164:33.35]Here's you, there's Matt.
[164:34.99]There's you, there's... Oh, Matt's gonna be your shadow!
[164:48.50]This way?
[164:53.76]Uh... Uh... Uh... I guess?
[165:07.74]Sure.
[165:09.36]Sure.
[165:09.80]That's where everybody died.
[165:11.02]That's where the giant chaos was.
[165:13.76]What about this way?
[165:22.22]At least now I can actually explore this.
[165:30.61]My character's stinky?
[165:31.75]Why am I saying that?
[165:38.17]Oh.
[165:38.71]Hey.
[165:39.41]I know you.
[165:40.03]Hi.
[165:41.41]Won't you buy something?
[165:43.05]My poor child is sick.
[165:44.55]He needs your help.
[165:46.83]Sick person again.
[165:47.63]Alright, what we got?
[165:50.35]What do you have for me?
[165:56.10]Chain helmet.
[165:56.92]Meridian helmet.
[165:58.86]All this stuff is way too expensive.
[166:01.24]I guess I could get some full moon grass.
[166:06.04]Late moon, full moon.
[166:06.92]I'll just get some full moon.
[166:10.40]It's too expensive, though.
[166:11.60]It's way too expensive.
[166:20.07]Why don't I help this woman and her child?
[166:23.91]Because... I don't know.
[166:28.09]What the hell?
[166:28.55]Hmm.
[166:32.12]Hmm.
[166:41.86]Too expensive.
[166:42.78]Kill her.
[166:46.46]Although she does have... Try to right-hand weapon for stronger fire.
[166:50.07]Maybe I should get some of these.
[166:53.21]Let's get strong fire.
[166:54.31]That stuff is going to be, like, deadly later.
[167:00.82]I'm going to need to use that and smash people.
[167:04.62]Let's keep going.
[167:14.07]So wait, I'm confused.
[167:16.05]That wasn't the place I need to be?
[167:23.77]I don't understand.
[167:27.65]And I couldn't dodge on... I was standing on the fucking little... I was standing up here with him.
[167:31.13]Telling me I couldn't dodge that shit.
[167:33.24]Get out of here.
[167:44.94]Well, this is, um, a predicament indeed.
[167:50.74]I guess that wasn't the way I need to go.
[167:52.24]I got the shortcut, and I went back, and then now I don't know where the hell I'm even going.
[168:08.29]The only other place I didn't go was when all those huge guys were in the same spot.
[168:14.35]It's close to the shortcut.
[168:18.37]Oh, this is the only place I didn't even look.
[168:19.67]Let me just look over here.
[168:20.85]I'm not going to fight these guys.
[168:22.11]I'm just going to see if there's anything, like, here.
[168:35.54]Where am I going?
[168:36.18]I just want to see what's back here.
[168:40.00]Just these three huge guys.
[168:41.34]Alright, let me just go back to the shortcut.
[168:51.86]I gotta just find the right way from the shortcut.
[168:57.06]When did I last have a shower?
[168:58.28]Well, me.
[168:59.70]Not that long ago.
[169:04.83]The character?
[169:05.49]Probably a long time.
[169:09.59]Alright, so I have like... God damn it.
[169:18.37]I'm going for a QB sneak.
[169:24.96]I couldn't dodge on that.
[169:25.74]I was standing on the fucking wooden plank.
[169:32.85]Like, I was standing on the plank.
[169:34.07]I'm on the fucking plank, and I can't dodge.
[169:38.67]I actually don't even care.
[169:39.29]I'm just gonna go back to this right now.
[169:46.31]Like, you gotta give me, like, from software.
[169:48.65]What the fuck are with these hitboxes?
[169:50.99]The detection.
[169:52.49]I'm clearly standing up on the fucking plank up there with him.
[169:55.35]And I can't dodge.
[169:57.13]No matter.
[169:57.51]I'm gonna go to the shortcut.
[170:01.25]And I ain't gonna take anything.
[170:02.51]I'm gonna just go back.
[170:05.61]This fucking confusing mess of a level.
[170:09.67]What a mess this place actually is.
[170:14.21]I'm glad they remade this place again.
[170:21.06]What a fucking mess.
[170:26.94]Alright, so where the hell is it?
[170:41.21]From Software Upset Streamer.
[170:43.39]What a mess!
[170:46.13]It would be one thing if, like, the architecture wasn't... Like, these people made this whole place out of an anthill.
[170:52.62]Alright, so I'm going to go back here.
[170:54.10]We're going to keep going this way.
[171:02.54]Currently... What about this?
[171:05.30]No, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[171:09.46]Okay.
[171:11.76]What's next?
[171:16.69]A super sub-Jupiter...
[171:23.69]That lock-on is the worst decision you could ever make here.
[171:27.65]These flying insects.
[171:33.41]Come on.
[171:35.98]Come from downwind.
[171:36.92]Come on.
[171:41.90]You're taking your sweet time to get over here.
[171:45.74]Well, they're not.
[171:46.26]I have to get them in the right aggro range.
[171:48.03]I'm going to fall off.
[171:52.00]Thank God I didn't.
[171:57.45]I don't even care.
[171:58.58]You're not that fast to come get me.
[172:06.14]Now the whole family's here.
[172:07.32]Alright.
[172:08.10]Just go by them.
[172:09.40]You're blocking the fucking- That's blocking the way.
[172:12.03]That's blocking the way?
[172:13.41]You're blocking the way?
[172:15.29]This thing's blocking my way.
[172:17.17]You!
[172:17.91]You!
[172:19.09]Your hitbox is as big as the whole- Why are you alive?
[172:22.21]Your hitbox is as big as the whole fucking corridor.
[172:24.84]But I can't kill you.
[172:27.20]Oh, boy.
[172:31.92]Now I am gonna deal with you.
[172:41.10]Yowzers.
[172:45.00]Alright, what about up over here?
[172:49.08]This way?
[172:49.60]I could go down, but I don't think that's it.
[172:52.96]Maybe it is.
[172:53.44]I just want to take a look.
[172:54.34]Let's be cautious.
[172:55.18]I'm not going to throw caution to the wind here.
[173:07.64]Isn't there a guy right there?
[173:22.04]It's down, but there's a cross.
[173:28.78]I just want to clear it out.
[173:33.35]Like over here.
[173:35.41]Okay.
[173:37.93]I haven't been this way.
[173:39.01]Alright, it's definitely this way.
[173:40.61]Let's do this little... Let me just deal with all these idiots.
[173:47.94]Okay.
[173:52.09]Okay.
[174:02.02]Don't be a hero, man.
[174:03.52]Not gonna get you far.
[174:07.92]Alright, so I'm inside here.
[174:11.38]Nothing of interest.
[174:13.10]Just wanted to check it out.
[174:14.86]That's not the way to go, apparently.
[174:17.70]Up here.
[174:19.40]What about that?
[174:25.19]Is that a guy?
[174:26.15]Is that a weird enemy?
[174:27.01]Or is that something that... That's not an enemy, right?
[174:35.04]That looks like a weird stick tree person.
[174:43.30]Don't push me.
[174:43.88]I see you.
[174:48.82]I think we're making progress.
[174:49.83]There it is.
[174:52.16]There's the fog gate.
[174:53.42]All right.
[174:54.00]So let me take my essence of life and prepare myself here because this is definitely a poison boss.
[175:01.56]Why wouldn't it be?
[175:02.14]Let's give it a solid attempt here.
[175:05.94]I got a late moon grass, full moon grass.
[175:09.34]Okay.
[175:11.30]I'm ready.
[175:27.67]So, let me hope that this boss takes one swing and dies.
[175:31.27]Okay, let's get this ready.
[175:36.07]Let's see what it is.
[175:37.93]The moment you've all been waiting for.
[175:39.89]Dirty.
[175:41.09]Dirty Colossus.
[175:44.11]Dirty.
[175:47.95]Not to be confused with the... Not to be confused with clean Colossus.
[176:02.69]And one hit.
[176:04.04]That was really greedy.
[176:10.30]I shouldn't have done that.
[176:11.70]Watch out for the cannon.
[176:31.34]This guy, this guy is, uh, not only is this guy dirty, but this guy sucks.
[176:39.83]This is the easiest, this is the easiest boss in the game, by far.
[176:43.49]Without a doubt.
[176:46.59]Oh my god, this guy's so easy.
[176:47.77]I'm gonna kill him in one second.
[176:48.89]Watch this.
[176:49.47]Count to one.
[176:50.67]One.
[176:52.65]Two.
[176:54.17]Three.
[176:54.55]That's the easiest boss in the game.
[176:56.91]Thank God, because the area was fucking unbearable.
[176:59.77]Thank God that guy was the easiest boss in the entire game.
[177:10.66]That was by far the easiest thing in the whole game.
[177:14.38]Thank God.
[177:18.38]Alright.
[177:21.89]Adjuncticator?
[177:22.65]The Adjuncticator was actually kind of scary.
[177:27.07]Just because, like, I had to figure out, like, in that whole process that I had to, like, break the splinter in his side.
[177:40.45]He's not supposed to be done now, this guy?
[177:42.35]Well, eh, so maybe, like... I did, like, this whole game backwards, didn't I?
[177:50.95]Like, I fought, like, the Flame Lurker way, way too soon, right?
[178:02.46]Don't put the dirty Colossus trophy in your bedroom.
[178:10.98]I hit like a small train.
[178:14.40]It can be done in any order.
[178:15.48]Okay.
[178:17.82]Only two more areas.
[178:18.74]I'm going to finish Demon's Souls tonight.
[178:23.27]Yes.
[178:37.69]I think I'm gonna break, like, all of these, by the way.
[178:41.45]I think I am.
[178:41.87]Let's see, what does the yellow Demon Soul do?
[178:51.52]Uh... Soul, then, no.
[178:54.72]Just break it.
[178:57.10]Don't need it.
[179:02.54]What about the eroded Demon Souls?
[179:08.00]Yeah, this is the only thing I look up.
[179:11.36]That's not cheating.
[179:12.46]I don't want to... Look, here's the only difference.
[179:14.38]The only difference is I go to the blacksmith and look.
[179:17.17]It's the same damn thing.
[179:18.81]Alright, I don't want this either.
[179:28.21]Okay, these... Maybe, you know.
[179:30.75]Okay, I have a lot of these to crush.
[179:36.88]Let's go with this.
[179:45.90]Legendary story.
[179:47.20]All kinds of stories.
[179:48.36]That's it, right?
[179:50.54]Yes.
[179:58.49]Go fight the mini-boss in 1-1.
[180:00.57]There's a mini-boss in 1-1?
[180:12.20]What is the Old Spice for?
[180:13.30]It's an MP.
[180:14.46]I'm not doing, um... I'm not doing the magic in the game, but it's how you refill your magic.
[180:19.88]It's like a magic mana potion.
[180:21.08]Alright, let's see what we got.
[180:26.37]Let's just get this to 30 for fun and get, let's just, vitality.
[180:29.39]30?
[180:30.47]I'm ready to go.
[180:31.41]May thine strength help the world be mended.
[180:43.13]Body odor.
[180:48.47]I don't have any more colorless demon souls, or whatever they are.
[180:57.56]Late.
[180:59.54]Full.
[181:00.74]And let's put new on, just because.
[181:02.68]Why not?
[181:07.94]I have this black turpentine.
[181:09.48]Let's put the black turpentine on.
[181:10.94]I gotta start using this stuff more often.
[181:14.76]How am I not fat-rolling?
[181:15.88]Because I have the Ring of Great Strength.
[181:21.26]So, it makes me possible to have this weapon and not fat-roll.
[181:25.05]Alright, where are we off to now?
[181:31.29]Should I just keep going?
[181:32.39]Just do 5-3?
[181:35.92]That's the next in line, right?
[181:37.32]I only have like two more places to do.
[181:38.98]That's the only other one, right?
[181:40.14]That or 1-4 is the only other one, right?
[181:48.77]Where did I get that?
[181:49.53]Oh, it's because I killed your beloved Beor.
[181:55.45]Killed him.
[182:01.89]Ooh, more side.
[182:03.15]5-3?
[182:04.81]Okay, cool.
[182:08.29]Just deposit some more.
[182:10.03]That's good.
[182:10.73]Don't say his name.
[182:17.23]Alright, 5-3 it is.
[182:18.19]Let's do it.
[182:24.99]Dirty Colossus Archstone.
[182:28.25]I don't know how to say his name.
[182:33.45]Thank you DieTro for the bits.
[182:34.81]Pushguy or Maneater Mildred for Jermarumble.
[182:39.04]That was a nice burp, sorry.
[182:42.58]I'm sure there will be a Demon's Souls character.
[182:45.84]I have, like, at least one or two that I would want to put in.
[182:49.70]So, you'll see a Demon's Souls character in the next Rumble, for sure.
[182:52.23]Uh, never trust purple, thanks for the five bucks.
[182:55.77]Learning 3D spaces and object permanence featuring Derma985.
[182:58.55]That's me.
[183:01.08]Yep.
[183:01.90]I have trouble bumping into shit.
[183:05.11]Thank you, Deathman Jones, for the buck.
[183:07.15]Since I don't know if you saw my last Cheer Alaskan skin, would you be willing to play one of the older Resident Evil games in October, namely Remake or RE4?
[183:16.63]Well, RE4 is the best Resident Evil game ever made.
[183:18.49]I think Resident Evil 4 is up there in like the top 25 best games ever made.
[183:23.78]So I've played through Resident Evil 4 maybe like three or four times across like three or four systems.
[183:31.88]Remember when that was coming out, every system?
[183:34.90]It was like, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Wii.
[183:38.32]I've played pretty much every iteration of that game.
[183:42.14]I think Resident Evil 4 should be in the top 20 best games ever made.
[183:45.55]I do.
[183:49.09]But, I don't know if I would play that on stream.
[183:52.25]It's not necessarily something that I would... Maybe, but October, there's a... Excuse me.
[183:56.64]I'm gonna get a frog in my throat.
[183:59.95]There are a lot of games coming out in October.
[184:02.79]I'm looking forward to most of it.
[184:04.95]Like Shadow War.
[184:08.15]What's in that?
[184:09.29]I can't even play it.
[184:10.21]Evil Within 2.
[184:11.77]Looks fucking crazy.
[184:13.69]So you will absolutely see the Evil Within 2 be played on this stream for sure.
[184:22.08]That looks so much better than the first one.
[184:25.22]Yeah, Shadow War comes out next month.
[184:28.44]Don't worry.
[184:29.10]We'll play some spooky games in October.
[184:30.76]We'll get our horror fix in October.
[184:32.69]Don't worry.
[184:37.95]I guess I'm just going down this hole.
[184:39.47]This is the place to go.
[184:44.55]I guess.
[184:49.95]Cuphead stream tomorrow?
[184:50.95]Yes.
[184:51.31]I'm going to beat Demon's Souls tonight.
[184:52.87]I'm going to complete Demon's Souls.
[184:53.99]And then tomorrow is Cuphead.
[184:56.55]And I'm not sure if anybody knows or if anybody is familiar with the Cuphead story.
[185:01.87]Me and Italics were going to play it.
[185:03.98]But we didn't even think to.
[185:05.72]We just automatically assumed it was going to be co-op online.
[185:09.62]And it's not.
[185:11.78]So Cuphead is not online co-op.
[185:13.82]Can I kick this down?
[185:16.16]Why would I climb down half of a ladder?
[185:17.45]Is this half a ladder or am I just stupid?
[185:22.94]It's a full ladder.
[185:23.76]All right.
[185:23.98]That was a weird optical illusion.
[185:26.82]So I will be soloing Cuphead for as long as I'm able to tomorrow.
[185:32.52]I don't know how long that's going to be, but I think this is a boss immediately.
[185:36.16]So let's get our black turpentine ready, and we'll see what this is.
[185:40.28]Okay, cutscene.
[185:45.58]Do Italics and I live far away from each other?
[185:47.16]Yes.
[185:47.92]I live across pretty much the whole country from Italics.
[186:02.63]Mario Odyssey.
[186:03.33]Mario Odyssey looks unbelievable, by the way.
[186:07.23]I talked about this a little bit last... I watched, like, the trailer again.
[186:09.65]That game looks fucking fantastic.
[186:12.31]I need to get a Switch now.
[186:15.95]There's so many games coming out, man.
[186:17.92]I'm gonna be so busy.
[186:20.35]There's so much shit going on over the next few weeks and the next few months.
[186:24.56]I'm gonna be such a... Who's the boss?
[186:28.12]Go forth, Galvin.
[186:30.98]May you be unharmed.
[186:33.04]Isn't this a PvP fight?
[186:42.89]Maiden Astrea?
[186:43.89]Oh, is this one of those... Leave us, slayer of demons.
[186:50.81]Is he walking up here?
[186:51.59]Okay.
[186:51.95]He's over there, huh?
[186:53.09]That's a lot of items.
[186:56.93]Is this a... Do I have to fight on both at the same time?
[187:03.90]Cookie bug.
[187:04.90]Get it?
[187:24.61]Not like I even care at this point.
[187:27.10]Now, these guys don't do anything, so why?
[187:28.86]Okay, hold on.
[187:29.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[187:30.68]Where is he?
[187:34.40]I'm gonna drop down again.
[187:45.16]Oh, fuck.
[187:46.50]Oh, fuck.
[187:47.68]Oh my god, the fucking... These, like, infant... These weird, like, babies.
[187:53.07]Mistakes!
[187:54.43]There was a lot of mistakes made here!
[187:56.29]I can't dodge!
[188:09.12]Note to self, don't go down to the Binding of Isaac real life puppet trailer enemies.
[188:26.17]I just got killed by, like, Super Meat Boy.
[188:30.17]Oh my fucking god.
[188:32.79]It doesn't even matter.
[188:36.23]You could hear me talk a bunch of shit.
[188:38.11]Right, but I'm not going to.
[188:43.62]Just take this dumb thing.
[188:45.38]I still have, like, plenty of these, right?
[188:47.62]Have I been just utilizing these too much?
[188:50.02]I've been just... These are such a crutch.
[188:53.26]Alright, just...
[188:56.87]I think this is one of those scenarios where I have to just be slow.
[189:00.69]Just slow down.
[189:02.95]It's like a maze.
[189:04.01]You have to, like, do the puzzle.
[189:04.99]You have to fight all the enemies and go through the puzzle, boss.
[189:08.57]There, he's over there.
[189:09.93]I can go down this way.
[189:11.03]That's what I'm gonna do.
[189:12.83]I'm gonna fight him on the walkway.
[189:15.59]What a bad idea.
[189:16.61]Okay, this guy's fucking dead.
[189:20.86]Let's go.
[189:21.24]Come on.
[189:23.55]Get your shield up, that's fine.
[189:24.75]That's fine, Carl.
[189:26.93]Dude, this is what you get for talking, man.
[189:40.40]As I, like, die.
[189:44.68]Come on!
[189:45.16]Hey!
[189:53.54]Oh my fucking god.
[189:55.84]Come on.
[189:56.69]Get over here.
[189:58.65]I'm being so impatient.
[190:00.43]Can I not hurt him?
[190:07.61]Did he run away?
[190:13.56]He's running away.
[190:19.66]I'm not fucking myself in the face by doing this, right?
[190:24.30]The babies.
[190:24.70]Watch out for the babies.
[190:25.34]Babies.
[190:25.62]Wait a minute.
[190:30.06]What?
[190:30.81]She's standing right back there.
[190:31.81]I have an idea.
[190:41.75]Oh, this is... I didn't know it was this shit here.
[190:43.89]Just fucking kill her.
[190:45.33]She's standing right there.
[190:46.83]Just kill her.
[190:48.66]Wait, I can talk to her?
[190:50.88]Why can't I talk to her?
[190:54.38]I'm so confused right now.
[190:55.58]Do I, like, talk to her first?
[190:57.96]No, I want her to run.
[191:00.26]What is this shit?
[191:07.50]Fuck you.
[191:13.70]I gotta get... The plague shit is still on me.
[191:18.98]Do I... Should I not kill her?
[191:21.16]Should I kill him?
[191:21.94]Talk to him?
[191:25.51]Can I talk to her?
[191:27.07]Well, she has her, like, boyfriend protecting her.
[191:33.39]I'm gonna go for it.
[191:34.09]I'm gonna go for it.
[191:34.55]Wait, no, no.
[191:39.46]No, no, no!
[191:40.18]It's this one!
[191:40.56]Take it!
[191:41.10]Okay, I'm fine.
[191:44.56]Okay.
[191:47.18]I'm gonna talk to her.
[191:48.90]I'm gonna be diplomatic here.
[191:54.22]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[191:57.12]Hello?
[191:58.76]Hello?
[191:59.06]I tried to be diplomatic.
[192:01.64]Didn't work.
[192:02.08]Everyone's telling me to go talk to her.
[192:25.34]Alright, now you're both in big trouble.
[192:26.84]I ain't fucking around anymore.
[192:33.61]What was I thinking?
[192:34.35]I don't know, like, the way that you guys were describing that made it seem like I could talk to her and she'd be like, Wait!
[192:39.57]Stop, Carl!
[192:40.71]And he would stop fighting me.
[192:42.28]I don't know.
[192:49.78]From all I know, it could have been, like, one of those situations where it was a secret.
[192:53.60]Guys, do you remember when you stand still at the beginning of Far Cry 4?
[192:58.50]What if that happened here?
[193:03.14]He's dead.
[193:03.74]I'm killing them both.
[193:08.84]I don't care.
[193:09.32]I'm going to bait the guy out and I'm going to kill him.
[193:11.40]I don't even need to use Turpentine.
[193:14.06]But I am going to put this on my bar because, excuse me, I'm not dying to that.
[193:26.29]He's gonna say the line, that's fine.
[193:31.02]Can't believe you're done this- this day.
[193:41.31]Don't even give him a fucking chance.
[193:43.73]He-
[194:05.49]I got fucking parried.
[194:08.37]Go on, die.
[194:09.42]Yeah, fine.
[194:10.98]Do your dumb shit that you're gonna do.
[194:17.78]Oh shit!
[194:21.62]That's so greedy there.
[194:24.28]It's fine.
[194:24.80]I can just sit here.
[194:26.06]Doesn't even matter.
[194:42.65]Easy.
[194:45.65]What are you doing?
[194:47.59]What an idiot.
[194:48.51]Backstab him for the fucking... Yeah!
[194:53.79]Backstab to win.
[194:56.51]Okay, so there she is.
[194:58.51]What do we have?
[195:02.32]Tons of shit.
[195:03.02]Okay.
[195:03.16]We have a plague now.
[195:05.22]That's fine.
[195:09.20]Do I let her talk?
[195:11.50]Or do we just insta-kill her?
[195:19.18]Talk.
[195:24.37]Kill the babies.
[195:30.67]The time for talk is over.
[195:32.57]All right, let me just hang out up here for a second.
[195:42.53]You... You killed him, didn't you?
[195:46.22]Yes, I did.
[195:48.14]Very well.
[195:49.40]I can no longer resist you.
[195:53.46]Do as you like.
[195:54.80]Take your precious demon soul.
[196:02.05]Whoa.
[196:03.19]What?
[196:05.45]Oh.
[196:18.65]I mean, that was the second worst boss fight in the game.
[196:20.37]That was... That boss fight sucked.
[196:24.47]What's with the vial of defilement?
[196:26.53]Having the shittiest bosses in the whole game.
[196:33.23]Ring of sincere prayer.
[196:34.41]Well, I have to, like, leave.
[196:45.96]Alright, well, let's go.
[196:48.64]There's nowhere else for me to go, right?
[196:54.18]The vile of com... death of what?
[196:59.64]You have no soul if I call this boss bad.
[197:01.22]I mean, not bad, but it was just... Streamer kills innocents and calls it easy.
[197:13.25]No, that's not what I'm doing.
[197:15.73]I didn't say it was easy.
[197:16.83]I just said... Look, it wasn't even easy.
[197:18.03]That was hard.
[197:18.61]It's a hard game.
[197:19.69]So don't even try to come at me here.
[197:27.41]So I have one more place to do.
[197:29.51]1-4, right?
[197:30.03]That's it.
[197:31.11]And then I beat Demon Souls on stream.
[197:33.79]Let's just go with health.
[197:37.29]I still have a couple of these, right?
[197:40.61]So what do you get for that?
[197:42.13]Pure Blood Demon Soul.
[197:56.98]I wonder what you get for turning in a pure-blood Demon's Soul Harry Potter.
[198:03.49]Alright, let's do, uh... What are we gonna do here, uh... Let me look it up.
[198:12.93]Pure-blood... Demon's Soul... Oh, what a mean voice.
[198:26.51]Okay, you get resurrection, some kind of sword.
[198:33.19]Oh, that thing's kind of cool.
[198:34.27]Blue blood sword.
[198:35.69]Oh, oh, ooh!
[198:37.59]Hold on.
[198:40.11]What does this do?
[198:43.42]Hmm.
[198:47.92]So you get a luck weapon for this.
[198:52.62]That's so cool.
[198:54.42]You get a luck weapon for this.
[199:06.55]Alright, I'm about to beat Demon's Souls, here we go.
[199:10.85]Let's store some stuff, let's go beat the game.
[199:15.56]1-4.
[199:35.15]RIP best sword in the game.
[199:37.50]Well, I'm not doing a luck build, guys.
[199:40.92]I'm doing a strength, massive strength, two-hander, smashy guy.
[199:55.47]Dark Silver Shield.
[199:57.43]It's not funny, I haven't taken this off the whole game.
[199:58.88]It's just, I like it too much.
[200:01.12]Dark Silver Helmet.
[200:03.83]Okay, I feel like I want to try to put some of this on.
[200:10.92]40 out of... Can I put it on?
[200:14.68]No.
[200:18.76]Can't put the gauntlets on either.
[200:24.52]What if I put these on?
[200:30.15]This thing's just better.
[200:31.97]It just weighs a little.
[200:32.73]More magic defense, but it weighs more.
[200:41.48]That roll.
[200:42.38]Damn it.
[200:42.98]I look cool, too.
[200:49.67]What about the other stuff that I have?
[200:51.13]Is this going to do it?
[200:51.67]46 out of 88.
[201:03.12]Oh, well.
[201:05.14]Well, I'll keep these on.
[201:06.24]I think these are cool looking.
[201:10.55]Yeah, I just can't quite do it.
[201:11.69]What about... I need to... Under 40.
[201:12.89]What about that thing that I have here?
[201:16.43]I know I have something else.
[201:19.13]Let me see.
[201:22.56]Saints Row Brushwood.
[201:23.80]No, that's way too heavy.
[201:27.54]Can't divide by two?
[201:28.54]Yes, I can.
[201:31.89]Look it.
[201:32.37]I got like the funny squid helmet on.
[201:37.32]Alright, that's fine.
[201:37.98]Regeneration.
[201:38.72]Spring of strength.
[201:39.44]That's cool.
[201:40.98]Cool.
[201:42.04]Let's do it.
[201:42.62]1-4.
[201:44.26]1-4.
[201:49.90]This is the last area that I have not done.
[201:53.88]Fat rolling fucking loser.
[202:00.31]That was harsh.
[202:00.91]Damn.
[202:10.30]Shit was harsh.
[202:14.14]Have I done the final boss?
[202:15.14]I have not.
[202:21.35]I'm on my way to the final, I guess, area.
[202:25.87]I guess.
[202:26.17]Let's just move along.
[202:30.19]One for Boletarian.
[202:33.68]Boletarian Palace.
[202:36.94]Actually, I was here before.
[202:39.56]I fought some people here.
[202:40.66]The reach on this thing is fucking disgusting.
[202:51.66]If there's one thing I can tell you about this is, holy shit, this thing is fucking disgusting.
[203:03.19]Use code FATFUCK.
[203:13.45]How many bosses are in Demon's Souls?
[203:19.01]Like, 15?
[203:19.45]14?
[203:20.11]Oh, cookie.
[203:29.33]Why is it... It's here every time.
[203:30.93]It really is.
[203:31.51]This thing has never not been here.
[203:34.35]I remember this guy.
[203:35.01]This guy.
[203:35.27]I was freaking out about this guy.
[203:36.74]That's before I was un-fucking-beatable.
[203:45.87]You know, I may have had a problem with that guy before I was unbeatable.
[203:51.17]I got 40 strength, 40 stamina, 40 endurance, 40 vitality.
[203:54.77]I got the 40-40-40 build.
[203:56.01]It's like the new tax code.
[203:57.05]40% sales tax, 40% income tax, 40% state tax.
[203:58.05]New tax code.
[204:15.50]Well, that's fine.
[204:19.91]And everybody retires at 40.
[204:27.95]So yeah, I mean, a 40% income tax, that's fucking horrible.
[204:32.62]40% sales tax, but dude, everybody gets to retire at 40.
[204:36.42]And you get like a huge social security check every month.
[204:46.32]I hear something.
[204:49.60]No, it's me.
[204:53.78]Huge.
[204:57.07]Another dragon.
[204:59.53]Is this the boss of 1-4?
[205:00.41]I'm going to assume it's 1-4.
[205:09.13]Yeah, this is the boss of... This is the boss.
[205:10.59]Alright, so... Your little brother was a pain in the ass.
[205:13.60]I wonder how much of a pain in the ass he was.
[205:26.57]How far does it go?
[205:27.09]Okay, we're gonna do a test.
[205:28.95]How far does the fire go?
[205:30.03]Still okay.
[205:33.05]How far are we good?
[205:38.19]Still okay.
[205:38.79]How about now?
[205:41.06]We're okay now?
[205:44.12]How about now?
[205:45.90]Right over the first pillar.
[205:46.74]Still fine.
[205:50.43]What about here?
[205:51.17]What about just after the first pillar?
[205:54.59]Yep, alright, so that's where it is.
[205:55.91]Right at the pillar here.
[206:21.15]Huh?
[206:23.75]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[206:31.18]I'm a chicken.
[206:31.94]What do you mean chicken?
[206:32.68]I want to get the item.
[206:34.76]I'm safe right there with that guy standing.
[206:39.76]Okay.
[206:44.26]Maybe I'm not.
[206:46.58]Oh shit.
[206:47.34]Just eat it.
[206:47.82]I can take one hit.
[206:48.64]I can take one hit.
[206:49.16]I can take one hit.
[206:49.62]Do it again.
[206:54.12]Okay.
[207:10.29]I brought this for a specific reason.
[207:15.54]I don't even have it.
[207:16.40]I put it away.
[207:22.37]How have I beaten all the other games?
[207:24.81]Because I fucking... I'm good.
[207:33.69]He's out of propane.
[207:34.61]Quick, get him.
[207:39.17]Oh, wait.
[207:39.43]I can go behind him.
[207:40.11]Okay, fine.
[207:46.58]No.
[207:47.51]He moved.
[207:51.49]What did you do?
[207:54.57]Where did he go?
[207:55.61]I don't know where he is.
[207:56.15]Is he down?
[207:56.65]Is he up?
[207:57.41]On top of this roof?
[207:59.01]He's gonna get in the field of view right now and he's gonna spray down, isn't he?
[208:02.81]Oh god, I can feel him.
[208:03.85]I can feel his hot, fucking smelly breath.
[208:05.71]Where is he?
[208:06.05]I don't know.
[208:11.39]He's up there now.
[208:13.09]Okay.
[208:21.87]How have I beaten all the other games?
[208:26.28]Well... Ooh.
[208:27.78]How am I supposed to know how far this guy shoots or what he does?
[208:30.52]This is blind.
[208:34.30]And look, I get it.
[208:34.90]I understand.
[208:35.36]Like, I beat Dark Souls 3 like six times, right?
[208:39.42]Like, and when you beat a game like fucking more than once or twice or three times, you know everything.
[208:45.03]I don't know anything about what's about to happen.
[208:47.31]For all I know, I could walk forward and like, I could get backstabbed by some fucking invading phantom.
[208:56.35]I don't even have any idea.
[208:57.87]Sorry.
[209:11.32]How far is that going to go?
[209:14.88]Yeah, I'm alright.
[209:15.86]I can stand right here.
[209:25.91]Streamer says solid stand.
[209:27.37]Very easy.
[209:27.95]Can I climb up this?
[209:30.57]No.
[209:30.81]What?
[209:31.17]What?
[209:31.67]I don't care about the items.
[209:34.53]I don't even need them anymore.
[209:54.51]Get behind something!
[209:55.39]Get behind something!
[209:57.45]Oh, fuck me.
[209:58.49]I'm in deep shit.
[209:59.59]I'm dead.
[210:11.44]I'm dead.
[210:14.86]Okay, well, that's one way to do it.
[210:23.20]Was I even safe behind those pillars?
[210:24.88]I don't think I even was.
[210:28.42]Just run past?
[210:29.39]I mean... I don't think I can get that far that fast.
[210:32.21]Maybe I can, I don't know.
[210:40.58]It was too tall.
[210:42.24]Well, what the fuck?
[210:52.06]Just give me the fucking exit.
[210:53.04]Like, does everything have to be so pitch black in these games?
[210:55.62]Especially this one.
[210:57.80]This should be... Nah, nice try.
[210:59.72]This is the game that should have been called Dark Souls.
[211:03.76]Oh, fuck you.
[211:08.42]Replace him.
[211:09.64]This is Dark Souls.
[211:11.44]The other one's Demon Souls.
[211:19.08]He's rushing.
[211:22.55]Fuck.
[211:22.85]Ay, ay, ay.
[211:50.90]You know what this game has more than any of the other solo games?
[211:54.14]Tiny hallways.
[211:57.07]For every tiny hallway in this game, there's like... I can't even give you a fucking metaphor because I'm enraged at all these tiny fucking halls.
[212:09.59]And little corridors.
[212:10.99]How many times have I been pressed up against a wall with a tiny lip on it?
[212:14.70]It's fucking horseshit.
[212:17.64]I like this game.
[212:18.12]It's a fun game.
[212:23.58]And now I'm just rushing.
[212:24.62]When you get on tilt in this game, you might as well just... You might as well just go to fucking bed.
[212:29.37]I eat shit.
[212:38.97]Give me some more space.
[212:41.49]Give me some... You know what?
[212:42.49]I need some space.
[212:44.11]This is me.
[212:44.57]I'm breaking up with you.
[212:45.51]I'm breaking up with you, demon souls.
[212:47.09]I need some space.
[212:53.80]Oh, I'm going to beat it tonight.
[212:54.84]I'm going to beat Demon's Souls tonight.
[212:56.07]I just have to get to the end of this.
[213:00.87]Oh, I'm going to complain.
[213:02.15]Hold on.
[213:03.55]Let me just get to the end of the same zone I just did.
[213:07.96]In 1-2, right?
[213:09.86]It's just a different colored dragon.
[213:14.14]Come on.
[213:15.53]This is a fucking different colored dragon.
[213:22.38]Don't worry, this time the dragon's blue.
[213:25.18]There's a huge difference.
[213:30.57]It hasn't got a secret.
[213:46.61]Blue dragon, yeah, it's just a blue dragon this time.
[213:57.26]Come on down.
[213:59.43]Okay.
[214:00.07]Let's try this again.
[214:03.61]He's gonna breathe, and then I'm just gonna run by.
[214:08.15]Stand over where it's safe.
[214:09.21]You know, I'm gonna let him kill this guy, because I ain't fucking around.
[214:12.79]Because that fat piece of shit will walk the way.
[214:20.31]Now, this is where I'm gonna go.
[214:21.47]Here we go.
[214:21.91]Three, two, one, action.
[214:31.58]I don't want to do this stupid fucking dumb dragon gimmick again.
[214:35.98]I already did this I've already done it.
[214:38.80]I don't want to do the dragon gimmick again And my in my fucking anger I'm just got myself killed again, no I didn't thank God I missed the bug it don't even matter
[215:04.57]Can I get there before he fucking does anything?
[215:06.37]He's flying away right now.
[215:09.41]Can I get there before he lands?
[215:11.09]No, I can't.
[215:14.57]Wait a second.
[215:15.11]I want to look over here.
[215:21.45]Nothing?
[215:24.87]Can't jump this?
[215:25.47]Apparently not.
[215:30.84]Uh, well, what's down here?
[215:44.85]There he goes.
[215:46.01]Can I just make it if I go straight?
[215:47.37]Stop it.
[215:50.33]I definitely can't make it the whole way.
[215:56.36]It happens every one second.
[215:59.64]What is he saying?
[216:02.74]Alright, he just went to the right.
[216:04.18]Does he go left or right?
[216:11.48]Looks like to the left side is safe.
[216:13.38]So if I go after this and stay on the left, I'm gonna be fine.
[216:15.94]Here we go.
[216:16.46]Stay left.
[216:22.47]Come on.
[216:24.83]Don't fucking do that to me now.
[216:32.89]No!
[216:45.25]Just get me in the front door.
[216:46.17]I don't even care.
[216:50.30]Okay, here's my friend.
[216:51.90]The guy that's been through the whole game.
[216:56.38]Okay, hello.
[217:00.84]Oh, it's you, is it?
[217:02.76]My father is up above.
[217:04.28]Your father, right.
[217:05.76]Well, what's left of him anyway?
[217:10.19]He's transformed into a fiendish demon.
[217:13.91]I began this quest in a search for truth, but it seems I was a fool to even try.
[217:21.06]Please, kill my father.
[217:25.06]In his degenerated state, he can only bring peril to the lands.
[217:30.44]This key fits the Boletaria Mausoleum.
[217:34.88]Inside the Mausoleum are my father's two swords.
[217:38.74]Soulbrand and Demonbrand.
[217:42.16]Use them to bring an end to this madness.
[217:48.86]I didn't do that.
[217:51.86]I didn't just do that.
[217:52.73]He did that.
[217:56.67]Do I have like an immolation aura on?
[217:59.84]Alright, well I have the secret key.
[218:05.62]I want those items.
[218:06.36]No, I don't.
[218:12.90]No, I don't.
[218:13.44]Who cares?
[218:20.62]Who's that?
[218:37.53]He's gonna fall off and I'm not gonna get his item.
[218:45.18]I didn't just let that happen, I almost did.
[218:49.88]Why is he coming after me with his soul?
[218:55.00]Cannot carry.
[218:55.99]Fuck me.
[219:00.09]What garbage can I just throw on the ground?
[219:04.73]Night sword.
[219:06.00]Like, get rid of this.
[219:07.34]Go over here and throw this away.
[219:15.90]Drop the... Night shield is... I mean, could be... That's scales.
[219:19.78]What does it do?
[219:22.58]Heavier.
[219:26.48]Drop all these.
[219:27.16]No, I can't drop all the arrows.
[219:28.42]What if I need them?
[219:29.50]Drop the stupid fluted helmet.
[219:31.10]I'm not going to use it ever again.
[219:32.88]And I have all the... You idiot.
[219:39.67]You fucking idiot.
[219:43.13]You idiot.
[219:51.54]Rune shield and his weapon, too.
[219:54.28]Rune sword.
[219:55.15]Remember in the very beginning of the game when I said I wanted those?
[219:57.23]Well, we're at the end of the game and here they are.
[220:04.27]Scales with strength, too.
[220:05.89]It's a magic!
[220:07.83]No, it's not.
[220:12.80]Powerful spells.
[220:25.91]Okay.
[220:31.98]So, am I at the end of the game?
[220:34.94]No, I had to pick up, like... Soul Brant and Demon Brant.
[220:51.00]Wait, what's wrong with the chat?
[220:54.62]Is something wrong with chat?
[220:58.20]I'm innocent.
[220:59.90]Oh, it's keeping people's names there?
[221:07.52]Where are the swords?
[221:20.04]Oh, there's a long elevator.
[221:20.96]You know that we're getting to the end of the game.
[221:25.33]And then it's gonna go... Here we go!
[221:30.91]So is this the final boss?
[221:39.88]I'm gonna assume yes.
[221:40.84]I don't know, maybe not.
[221:42.76]But can't you just do this?
[221:43.78]Can't you just go to 1-4 if you play through level 1?
[221:49.64]So how would this be the final boss if you can do anything in any order?
[222:02.40]Alright.
[222:02.88]This guy looks like my maid from World of Warcraft.
[222:07.40]And he has the same outfit too, and it's the same color.
[222:11.89]Not even gonna say anything.
[222:15.37]Old King Allant.
[222:21.74]Let's go.
[222:26.32]What is that?
[222:26.94]I don't know what you're doing.
[222:32.10]Okay, that's an explosion.
[222:33.67]He does an explosion.
[222:35.95]Let's do that again.
[222:38.15]How far is that?
[222:38.83]What is it?
[222:40.57]It's a huge explosion, that's it.
[222:47.30]Alrighty!
[222:48.00]Alright, that hurt.
[222:51.96]Okay.
[222:53.22]Well, there goes the pine resin.
[223:04.86]How far does it go?
[223:10.54]Come on, let's get this guy to dodge.
[223:15.46]He's really trying to fake bail me.
[223:30.67]That goes real far.
[223:35.72]Oh, god damn it.
[223:40.55]Oh my god, will you stop this shit?
[223:52.34]This guy's fun so far.
[223:53.64]Ooh, that hurt.
[224:08.51]Shit!
[224:13.38]Oh, the stamina.
[224:14.04]That stamina drain is fucking real.
[224:29.97]Back it up.
[224:35.41]Whoa!
[224:37.37]Whoa!
[224:39.55]Wow.
[224:41.10]The Invisible Walking Blaze ducked.
[224:43.58]Shut up, Jeremy.
[224:44.92]Yeah.
[225:15.17]I'll get combo'd.
[225:24.53]Ooh, I was not in a good spot for this one.
[225:30.48]I'm backing the fuck up here.
[225:37.50]Shit!
[225:38.30]No!
[225:39.66]No!
[225:40.98]Give me the distance!
[225:46.21]I'm so scared of that move.
[225:55.53]Fuck.
[225:56.53]This is the one.
[225:57.34]No!
[225:58.36]I think I'm too close.
[226:12.84]Oh, shit.
[226:14.48]I'm in trouble.
[226:14.92]Big trouble.
[226:19.37]Quick, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[226:23.63]Oh!
[226:26.35]You dummy!
[226:33.60]You gotta keep him in the middle, man, otherwise you're gonna get hit by that every single time.
[226:46.29]This is it for the fine, fine resin.
[226:52.57]Come on, get over here.
[226:54.69]Oh, boy!
[227:14.69]shit.
[227:15.11]Fuck you.
[227:17.33]That's a lot of dog shit.
[227:18.67]Fuck.
[227:19.49]You're not gonna do that shit to me.
[227:28.50]Come on, do the charge move.
[227:30.84]Let me see it from a mile away.
[227:31.94]Oh, fuck.
[227:36.25]He's gonna do it.
[227:43.73]I'm so paranoid of that move.
[227:44.99]I'm paranoid.
[227:53.04]He's got me all kinds of paranoid.
[227:56.52]Should be it.
[227:57.36]Not quite.
[227:59.28]Don't cocky.
[228:00.10]No cocky moves.
[228:00.98]No cock moves.
[228:01.80]This is it.
[228:05.43]See you later.
[228:12.55]I know, right?
[228:17.05]Hey!
[228:17.33]False king trophy.
[228:18.60]75,500 yummy souls.
[228:26.36]Time for phase two.
[228:29.46]Well, if they started doing that shit back in Demon's Souls, you would have seen me cry.
[228:36.94]False king demon.
[228:38.45]How did you defeat my precious demon?
[228:41.61]The real boss, right?
[228:42.35]No human has an appetite for souls such as you.
[228:47.69]The rest is up to the old one.
[228:50.53]If it is to be, then you shall be back in it.
[228:54.09]Okay.
[229:00.45]Wait, what did you say?
[229:01.01]The grab attack?
[229:02.85]The grab attack drains a level from you if you get grabbed by this guy?
[229:08.03]Alright, so what's the deal?
[229:09.08]Got 100,000 souls here, man.
[229:12.32]Like...
[229:19.38]Time for the real final boss.
[229:22.26]It's just these two guys.
[229:27.09]That takes levels away.
[229:28.83]Oh god.
[229:29.25]Am I gonna fight this fucking statue lady?
[229:32.79]Is that what I have to fight?
[229:54.46]It broke the glass.
[229:56.90]Wait, I've seen this movie before.
[229:58.16]I don't know what's down there.
[230:09.91]The fucking Rancor is down there.
[230:11.83]Good luck.
[230:15.18]Don't do it.
[230:15.66]Don't do it.
[230:16.16]You go down anyways.
[230:18.40]Why do I have a hundred thousand souls?
[230:21.79]Do I have to fight like the heart of the Nexus?
[230:45.41]Oh, 1-1.
[230:45.83]Oh fuck, 1-1.
[230:46.79]I forgot.
[230:47.59]I can't do 1-1.
[230:48.23]Wait, hold on.
[230:51.77]What?
[231:01.63]And then we climb out of the TV.
[231:07.68]In seven days, the phone rings.
[231:11.56]And our HBO subscription expires.
[231:23.60]Uh, so is she.
[231:27.60]I've seen this movie, too.
[231:29.92]Arrival.
[231:30.38]Wasn't even that good.
[231:32.10]It was a really slow movie about, like, learning languages.
[231:35.37]What a dumb movie.
[231:37.85]I'm sorry if you liked that movie.
[231:40.19]I'm like shit-talking that movie.
[231:42.13]Forget about it.
[231:42.65]Forget about what I said.
[231:54.87]I'm sorry.
[231:56.49]Look, I... I don't actually mean that.
[232:00.40]I just have to fight the tree boss from Dark Souls 3.
[232:02.98]And the giant from... Alright, this... Oh, shnack.
[232:11.11]This is just the tree demon from Dark Souls 2.
[232:13.25]What's that guy's name?
[232:15.23]The giant?
[232:16.03]The funny giant?
[232:17.85]The big giant?
[232:19.41]The jolly green giant?
[232:22.55]Big friendly giant.
[232:23.45]What's the guy's name from Dark Souls 2?
[232:33.13]Butt hole face.
[232:39.27]Yeah, that guy.
[232:43.29]Or for some of you old school gamers, Lavos from Chrono Trigger.
[232:49.55]This is Lavos.
[232:51.19]The fight is Lavos.
[232:52.15]I got it.
[232:58.57]Can I level up first?
[233:02.13]Level up with me.
[233:03.55]Let us proceed below to its lair.
[233:06.23]You won't give me anything.
[233:07.35]Okay.
[233:13.14]The old one.
[233:14.72]It's not this.
[233:15.70]It's just...
[233:18.05]There's a brush in the way.
[233:19.27]Okay.
[233:23.87]I'm not going to accidentally hit her, am I?
[233:29.59]Go back.
[233:30.29]What do you mean, go back?
[233:31.22]Back it up.
[233:31.60]What do you mean, back it up?
[233:32.52]I'm not saying back it up.
[233:33.42]What do you mean, back it up?
[233:36.82]Why am I going back?
[233:38.50]Oh.
[233:44.70]Go back to 1-1.
[233:46.69]That's not going to fuck up this whole end, is it?
[233:53.10]I can come back down here, right?
[233:56.66]So I'm going back to 1-1, is what you guys are saying.
[234:02.74]Don't, okay, like, I'm getting a lot of mixed messages from the chat room right now.

[235:30.22]God, that was such an easy, that was such a simple answer.
[235:34.73]That was the simplest fucking answer.
[235:37.11]And you guys had to complicate that so much for me.
[235:39.47]Is she still down there?
[235:40.39]Can I level up somewhere?
[235:43.17]Or did she come back with me?

[236:13.26]I was about to kill that guy.
[236:14.66]So, you want me to go to 1-1.
[236:30.14]So, 1-1 is in... Currently, it's in... It's not in, like, pure white tendency.
[236:37.63]Does that matter?
[236:46.73]It doesn't matter anymore?
[236:48.29]Just kill anybody.
[236:54.99]Oh shit, grandpa.
[236:55.89]I broke grandpa's table.
[236:58.26]How dare you break my fucking table.
[237:02.66]You know how long it took me to get that thing together?
[237:05.98]It took me like fucking four hours to build that thing.
[237:09.74]You little shit.
[237:11.56]Wait a minute, come here grandpa.

[239:19.50]Just go this way for a second.
[239:21.58]Oh, shit!
[239:22.60]Come on, Thomas!
[239:25.24]No, shit!
[239:25.70]Alright, there goes Thomas.
[239:32.51]All my items are gone.
[239:51.56]He's carrying all my stuff.
[239:56.65]I just dropped it in the... Oh, bye Thomas.
[239:59.05]Thanks for storing like fucking tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of souls worth of stuff.
[240:05.63]Hold on, wait, wait, hold on.
[240:07.11]If I go down there, will all my items be on the ground?
[240:12.43]I would laugh my ass off.
[240:15.99]If all that shit is on the ground.
[240:20.51]Fuck your pure sharp stone.
[240:25.89]Alright, are we going 1-1?
[240:26.99]Let's go to 1-1.
[240:35.90]I jumped down and find out.
[240:37.00]I can't even go down there.
[240:45.76]So, I'm not even halfway through the game.
[240:50.44]Oh, man.
[240:51.54]I love these games so much.
[240:57.97]So, they tell me there's a secret boss in 1-1.
[240:59.97]I have no idea where the hell that person, where this even is.
[241:05.16]Where the spear guy killed me.
[241:07.10]Oh, that's right.
[241:08.00]That's right.
[241:08.44]That's right.
[241:08.96]Okay.
[241:10.44]I forgot about that guy.
[241:13.58]there was a guy over there that I just couldn't fight.
[241:16.92]He's right over here, isn't he?
[241:22.50]He's very, very close to the very beginning of camp, isn't he?
[241:24.71]I'm trying to remember exactly where that was.
[241:27.97]Is it this way?
[241:34.43]I'm trying to remember exactly where the fuck that was.
[241:36.45]It was a long time ago.
[241:39.25]Correct me if I'm going the wrong way here.
[241:46.39]Am I going the wrong way?
[241:50.43]The other way.
[241:50.85]Okay.
[241:57.00]Yeah, go ahead.
[241:57.64]Fucking... You guys can do whatever you want.
[241:59.56]You're not gonna win.
[242:00.78]Knowing you're never gonna beat me.
[242:02.84]I've become too strong.
[242:09.20]Yeah, it's down here.
[242:13.64]Please die.
[242:14.28]I'm not gonna die here.
[242:18.33]Am I going the wrong way?
[242:21.37]Or do I go through here?
[242:29.85]This spear guy is not going to be able to beat me.
[242:31.21]He's just not.
[242:31.67]Wait, that was the right way.
[242:36.99]Guys, it's been a long time since I've been here.
[242:43.02]Get out of the fucking way.
[242:44.80]Please.
[242:50.07]beat the game so I can go to bed.
[242:51.49]I will.
[242:51.99]I'm at the very end of the game.
[242:53.17]We just have to get our revenge on this guy.
[243:00.75]The guy up here is a very special person we have to kill.
[243:04.16]Then I'm going to beat the last boss, the real final true boss.
[243:12.72]Alright, where the hell is he?
[243:19.92]Wait, these are the wrong stairs?
[243:26.85]No, stop.
[243:27.83]Stop telling me I'm going the wrong way.
[243:32.93]Don't listen to chat.
[243:33.81]It's the right way.
[243:35.29]I know.
[243:36.43]It's coming back to me.
[243:38.97]Boomerang.
[243:40.09]It's all coming back to you.
[243:42.95]Yep.
[243:43.29]Okay.
[243:43.63]Now I remember.
[243:44.29]He's down here.
[243:45.81]I know where he is.
[243:52.18]Or do I?
[243:55.82]He's up here.
[243:57.16]I think he's in one of these windows.
[244:05.64]No.
[244:05.98]You just keep going down all the way.
[244:09.56]Boomerang?
[244:12.81]Boomerang was a great, great, great, great...
[244:17.88]Great network.
[244:18.92]They played... Yogi Bear.
[244:22.14]Alright.
[244:25.66]So, here it is.
[244:27.21]Those are... I gotta get my revenge on this guy.
[244:29.75]This guy gave me a lot of trouble in the first, like, hour and ten minutes of the game.
[244:34.29]And I remember rage... I was gonna rage quit.
[244:36.39]So, let's, like, one-shot kill this guy.
[244:38.11]Get our fucking true revenge.
[244:40.59]Murder this guy.
[244:56.77]I was a little too cocky.
[244:58.33]A little too cocky at this guy.
[245:00.35]I thought I was gonna get him with one hit.
[245:13.16]There's no way to fight this guy with a sword as big as mine.
[245:19.93]Can we please just get out of the fucking walkway with a spear?
[245:27.35]Get the fuck over here.
[245:30.57]You dickhead.
[245:31.65]You fucking dingus.
[245:32.87]Just get over here and bounce off my shield.
[245:37.90]Okay, I got him in one hit.
[245:41.62]One hit.
[245:42.20]He's dead.
[245:43.54]What's behind the door?
[245:44.26]It was me all along.
[245:56.31]Uh...

[246:33.09]Thou dost well to impress one such as me, young knight.
[246:47.18]Okay.
[246:47.84]I am old King Doran, and thou hast proven thine strength to me.
[246:54.49]Go forth and take the king's sword in thine hand.

[247:15.97]Wait, now kill him with the sword.
[247:19.93]That's what I have to do?
[247:24.69]I have to kill him with the blade.
[247:29.39]I don't have enough dexterity to use this weapon.
[247:43.08]No.
[247:43.56]It's a dex weapon.
[247:44.34]Sure doesn't matter.
[247:45.90]Just use your regular sword.
[247:53.36]Does it matter which sword?
[247:54.74]Okay.
[248:00.94]Just dog just dog bone him Doesn't matter just don't cheese him So, uh, I went to the supermarket today
[248:27.10]And I was like, I was in line.

[248:40.54]I don't have enough time to put the fire on.
[248:44.22]I'm going to unlock a Luigi?
[248:46.94]Should I actually be doing this?
[248:51.70]No, I didn't want to challenge you until the 7th or 8th time I've hit you in the face.

[249:56.74]Parry him.
[249:57.16]Alright, I'm gonna go for a parry.
[250:00.04]With my dog shit shield.
[250:01.68]I can't parry with this thing.
[250:02.86]I don't even have a shield that can parry.
[250:06.88]I can't even parry with this thing.
[250:08.17]Can I parry with this?
[250:09.47]What is that person?
[250:14.05]Not a backstab apparently.
[250:15.09]Fuck that.
[250:20.37]Knock him off the edge.
[250:22.21]Good plan.
[250:25.92]Good plan, good plan, good plan.
[250:27.40]Where?
[250:28.42]Where am I going to make him fall?
[250:34.68]I can't even go get a new weapon.
[250:36.36]Because stockpile time has fell down the fucking hole.
[250:39.58]Come on.
[250:43.75]Get out here.
[250:44.75]You know what I'm trying to do, don't you?
[250:46.97]He's not going to come out here.
[250:53.37]Parry with the hand?
[250:58.54]You can't parry with the fucking hand.
[251:01.72]No, he won't come out.

[251:22.47]That's not a backstab!
[251:23.63]Ow!
[251:27.44]Oh no, I'm knocking him out of his aggro range.
[251:35.12]Perfect place.
[251:35.88]Perfect.
[251:43.11]Yep, he's gonna just try to get up and walk back to his fucking original spot.
[251:47.77]I got it.
[251:50.51]Yep, he's stuck here for good.
[251:52.17]He ain't making it out of here.
[252:00.88]All right, well, if you're watching the VOD, fast forward like three minutes.
[252:08.72]Perfect execution.
[252:12.56]I'm gonna get lazy.

[252:18.70]I can't concentrate and tell the story at the same time.
[252:26.65]More like 30.
[252:28.53]Why?
[252:28.79]Okay, explain to me why am I doing this?
[252:32.37]Why am I doing this?
[252:35.70]What's the point of me doing this?
[252:39.48]He has a great ring.
[252:40.52]Well, I'm about to end the game.
[252:45.16]Oh, fuck.
[252:46.12]I fucked it up.
[252:47.86]I fucked it up.
[252:49.58]Oh, God, no.
[252:50.48]I'm, like, knocking him in a lot of places I don't want to knock him.
[252:56.13]He's just turning into a ping pong ball.
[253:00.13]I don't want to lose this.
[253:01.51]This took too much time.
[253:03.07]Fuck.
[253:05.62]His AI refuses it.
[253:10.28]I just hope I don't fucking get him stuck somewhere.
[253:17.81]Don't knock him off the edge.
[253:19.13]This is just a sport.
[253:28.06]I have plenty of time to not screw it up, though.
[253:33.38]Don't knock him down the stairs.
[253:38.20]Okay, he's stuck in the ballista.
[253:39.76]We're good.
[253:45.68]That's only the 68th.
[253:47.38]How does that do, like, no... I thought I almost shot him through the hole there.
[253:50.82]Alright, let him get over here for a second.
[253:58.96]The cheese Olympics.
[254:00.26]Alright, should I do something, like, fucking funny?
[254:04.39]Alright, here's, like, your funny joke of the evening.
[254:11.81]Never mind.
[254:12.87]Never mind.
[254:21.12]There you go.
[254:21.44]There's your choke.
[254:26.87]No, I can't let him get sentient again.
[254:34.09]I healed him.
[254:37.55]No, don't!
[254:38.65]Oh, shit.
[254:39.53]This is not good.
[254:41.45]What's down here?
[254:43.19]Oh, there's a backstab.
[254:46.85]Wait, wait, hey.
[254:48.05]Excuse me, sir.
[254:51.11]Got him.
[254:51.91]He's dead, right?
[254:53.51]Where is he?
[254:53.84]He's right there.
[254:54.24]Okay.
[254:57.60]No, he's gonna... I'm not even gonna get the kill.
[254:59.54]This guy's kill-stealing me.
[255:13.09]Okay, got all of his stuff.
[255:24.80]So should I put all of his armor on?
[255:27.18]Should I be the Tin Man?
[255:31.41]Yeah, I'm gonna put on the Ancient King's mask.
[255:33.25]I'm gonna put all of his clothes on.
[255:39.79]And what was the ring?
[255:42.71]Raise his stamina recovery rate.
[255:48.09]Now I'm Medieval Colossus.
[255:53.49]Alright, I did it.
[255:57.12]I beat the secret boss.
[255:59.84]I have the secret sword.
[256:02.28]Alright, that was fun.
[256:08.40]Just get me the fuck out of here now.
[256:14.59]Yeah, I look like the index gun dude.
[256:19.30]Let's go back.
[256:20.46]Is it this way?
[256:21.02]Back here, right?
[256:23.50]Yeah, you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
[256:30.62]130,000 souls and nothing to do with them.
[256:32.36]Not true.
[256:32.84]There's still one other blacksmith that's alive.
[256:35.02]There's a townsperson that's still alive.
[256:38.70]Speaking of nothing to do...
[256:51.07]They're all gone now.
[256:53.01]I don't even care.
[256:54.63]Who cares?
[256:55.07]The game's over.
[256:56.08]Does anybody actually care?
[257:01.64]130,000?
[257:01.66]I don't even need the souls.
[257:23.76]Serves you right.
[257:28.78]Final boss incoming.
[257:33.46]Good job.
[257:33.80]I'm reaching the halfway point.
[257:41.30]This is a joke stream.
[257:42.30]I mean, we're... We're at the end, right?
[257:47.27]So, like, who doesn't even matter?
[257:51.09]I have no souls.
[257:51.77]I'm not going here for souls.
[257:54.74]I'm going here with a fucking pure black tendency.
[257:59.00]What do you think you're doing?
[258:00.98]When you can't get around me, you should watch yourself.
[258:03.64]This guy has pates.
[258:04.74]Not pate, patches.
[258:11.45]Holy shit, you're bad.
[258:16.71]What does it drop?
[258:27.18]What do you- what is it?
[258:29.04]Is there no item there?
[258:29.72]Is that just a- oh, that's just a fire.
[258:30.86]Okay, well, whatever.
[258:35.21]God damn it!
[258:36.39]Thank god.
[258:36.79]Let's go put him in the fucking fire!
[258:52.88]I'm gonna burn this guy.
[258:55.71]You're gonna be burnt by your own shit.
[258:59.14]Oh, whatever.
[258:59.42]Just fucking bury him.
[259:04.28]Alright, let's go.
[259:11.94]I had to make sure no one was alive.
[259:14.74]Where am I gonna buy grass?
[259:15.76]I don't need to buy grass.
[259:16.56]I'm about to see the end credits in like two minutes.
[259:24.79]That wasn't even worth doing.
[259:25.71]That wasn't even worth it.
[259:29.36]That loading screen was not... These two loading screens was not worth doing that.
[259:34.86]Alright, let's do it.
[259:35.62]Let's go.
[259:35.98]Final boss.
[259:37.16]Let's go kill him.
[259:39.85]So how do I get in here?
[259:42.53]Do I have to like warp there?
[259:45.11]Move to below the nexus.
[259:46.13]Okay.
[259:53.25]There's another boss?
[259:54.61]You moron.
[259:55.25]What are you talking about?
[259:59.34]No, I'm beating Demon's Souls.
[260:01.18]I'm killing them.
[260:04.20]I'm going in.
[260:04.80]I'm going undercover as the funny god prince.
[260:09.37]Let us proceed, but...
[260:18.45]Is another boss in 1-1?
[260:21.75]Whatever.
[260:22.15]I ain't gonna waste any more time.
[260:23.72]I'm gonna complete the game.
[260:28.00]This is going to be like the fucking, the Garamond fight from Bloodborne.
[260:33.24]It's going to be like going against the Scholar.
[260:35.58]He's like underwater.
[260:36.84]Okay, here we go.
[261:00.43]Everyone's telling me to kill the girl.
[261:01.83]No.
[261:09.17]King Elan.
[261:09.83]This is the boss?
[261:39.87]Is this like... He's gonna turn into something, right?
[261:52.59]He goes like, no, I'm angry!
[262:07.64]Um...
[262:18.98]It barely even hurts me.
[262:23.86]This is just a Binding of Isaac boss.
[262:27.96]What's his name?
[262:28.46]Like Gluttony?
[262:29.38]Pride?
[262:29.76]I'm not gonna die to this guy.
[262:34.58]Not a chance.
[262:38.22]He like already died.
[262:39.20]Oh, that was weird.
[262:47.93]Okay.
[262:48.91]Easy.
[262:49.27]Easy, Jeremy.
[262:49.71]Okay.
[262:52.78]Holy fuck.
[262:54.72]My fucking blood is going crazy right now.
[262:56.10]I'm fucking so nervous.
[262:57.72]Fuck.
[262:59.66]One more.
[262:59.92]Come on.
[263:00.34]One more.
[263:00.70]Come on.
[263:01.80]I'm so close.
[263:04.12]Eat.
[263:08.73]Don't be greedy.
[263:09.31]Don't be greedy, man.
[263:11.05]You fool.
[263:13.17]Don't you understand?
[263:15.23]No one wishes to stick along.
[263:20.74]The demon was destroyed.
[263:25.04]You revived.
[263:28.82]Stupid!
[263:33.53]What's going on?
[263:39.27]I can't even move.
[263:40.89]Your work is done.
[263:46.45]Slayer of demons, go back above.
[263:50.74]Okay.
[263:52.39]I missed the item.
[263:53.31]What item?
[263:57.43]Forgot the sword.
[263:58.31]I didn't... The sword on the ground?
[264:05.77]Press attack.
[264:06.33]I didn't get the sword.
[264:07.39]The game's over.
[264:08.96]Who cares if I go into new game plus and I don't have it.
[264:13.76]I shall lull the old one back to slumber.
[264:16.04]I shall lull the old one back to slumber.
[264:26.20]I know what to do.
[264:35.22]Yep.
[264:42.30]Quickly, come on!
[264:51.83]This is what you do.
[264:59.00]You gotta hit him with Demon Brint and then Soul Brint.
[265:10.48]What?
[265:24.73]Everyone told me to kill her!
[265:26.31]Everybody told me to do that!
[265:28.11]The old one sensed a new and powerful demon by its side.
[265:33.91]And before long, the world will be engulfed by the deep fog.
[265:42.76]Bring more souls.
[265:48.46]I'm a monster?
[265:50.54]That's the good ending.
[265:51.38]I become the most powerful entity in the world.
[265:54.14]How is that the bad ending?
[266:02.95]Why do you listen to chat?
[266:06.47]I don't know, it's for fun.
[266:10.78]That's the good ending.
[266:11.54]I've become more powerful than anyone ever could imagine.
[266:21.86]The old one eats the world.
[266:22.90]You're the most powerful entity of nothing.
[266:25.10]What about her?
[266:26.70]She was gonna go touch that thing, so she becomes the most powerful entity in the world?
[266:31.73]I did all the work.
[266:34.33]I went through the swamps.
[266:35.43]I went through 5-2.
[266:36.89]Did that motherfucker go through 5-2?
[266:38.91]No, she didn't.
[266:39.95]I did.
[266:41.07]That's my glory.
[266:42.13]That's my old god. ...
[266:50.57]She's going to lull it to sleep.
[266:54.15]Alright, well... You guys want my opinion on Demon's Souls?
[266:58.86]Here's my full opinion.
[267:01.86]Let me get this nice music to play, so... Uh, Demon's Souls... Level-wise... Really challenging, really difficult.
[267:12.04]Some of the areas were, like, extraordinarily frustrating.
[267:15.03]And super hard.
[267:18.10]Some of the bosses, a little on the thumbs down for me.
[267:24.09]Some of the bosses were awesome.
[267:27.63]The man-eaters were awesome.
[267:29.23]Flamelurker was awesome.
[267:30.65]That King Allant fight was awesome.
[267:32.37]It was very, very challenging, very interesting.
[267:35.40]But half the bosses were kind of just absolute pushovers.
[267:42.05]The bosses are, like, not the strong part of the game, for me at least.
[267:46.51]Although some of them were fairly difficult, yes.
[267:54.72]All in all, like, as a whole, if you take into consideration everything, fantastic.
[268:00.48]They're very, very, very fun.
[268:01.80]Very good.
[268:02.83]Highly recommend it if you have a PlayStation 3 and you're a Souls fan.
[268:07.59]You obviously should play the original, right?
[268:09.81]This is the original.
[268:12.03]Worth playing, worth doing.
[268:15.16]I would probably stick this right in the middle for me, just because of the way the game mechanics were.
[268:24.68]I will never play this.
[268:26.18]Oh, what?
[268:26.96]All right, I got a red eye stone.
[268:30.12]I got the beast demon soul.
[268:39.01]So what is this?
[268:41.17]Oh, this is just the beginning again.
[268:43.55]New game, plus time.
[268:46.27]No dab, I'm not gonna dab, I already did it.
[269:05.54]If you don't kill the maiden, you get a different soul in the trophy.
[269:08.70]What does the V-Soul get you?
[269:10.85]There I am in my full armor.
[269:19.97]With my Shakespeare mask on.
[269:21.45]I am the chosen one.
[269:31.46]Okay.
[269:32.14]So, uh, that is gonna be it.
[269:33.72]Thank you everybody for watching.
[269:41.55]This has been Demon's Souls.
[269:44.03]Tomorrow is...
[270:02.32]Cuphead.
[270:02.62]I'm gonna put the cap on Demon's Souls.
[270:04.94]I'm not gonna do any New Game Plus stuff.
[270:07.40]I kind of experienced everything I wanted to experience.
[270:09.88]Let me just take a look at that thing, though.
[270:12.94]The Beast's Soul.
[270:15.60]Oh, it doesn't do anything?
[270:18.81]What a total XD Jerma joke.
[270:21.11]No, I just swung at him a couple times.
[270:24.53]Come on.
[270:25.23]Don't call me an XD streamer.
[270:26.93]Don't do that.
[270:28.87]Don't do that to me.
[270:31.00]Don't do that to me.
[270:36.93]youtube the second ending I may in bed tonight when I'm like on the can but I'm going to bed on the can I'll like I'll do it uh beast soul beast demon soul just curious if it does anything oh no dude holy it gives two hundred thousands look at that I just want you to see this watch this holy
[271:06.35]That is a lot.
[271:09.81]Where is she?
[271:10.21]Is this lady just gone?
[271:16.72]Like, where the hell are you?
[271:17.40]Do you have any- Wait, does he have my stuff?
[271:24.14]He might have my stuff from the old game, right?
[271:27.40]And you guys thought it was all gone.
[271:28.68]You guys all thought it was gone.
[271:31.08]Here it is.
[271:32.77]We're good.
[271:33.53]We're good.
[271:37.43]I killed her.
[271:42.81]What?
[271:44.77]You unlock her after 1-1.
[271:46.10]Oh, shit.
[271:47.12]So why did I do that?
[271:49.40]Oh, well.
[271:49.86]Okay.
[271:51.24]That's gonna be it.
[271:55.91]I do look really cool, though, with this gear on.
[272:01.97]Just up my agility.
[272:02.86]Alright, everybody.
[272:04.92]I'll see you tomorrow.
[272:05.70]Same time, same place.
[272:07.92]7pm.
[272:09.48]Hopefully we're going to do Cuphead.
[272:11.18]Now, Cuphead is one of those games that is apparently it's like hyper excruciatingly difficult.
[272:21.83]So, we'll start with Cuphead.
[272:24.83]If I just can't fucking do it, then I'll have something.
[272:30.10]We'll do something else.
[272:31.75]But I've heard that Cuphead is crazy hard.
[272:36.33]We'll give it a try.
[272:39.10]That's been Demon's Souls.
[272:40.06]Thank you for watching.
[272:40.92]It's been a lot of fun.
[272:42.24]Hopefully it's been fun to watch.
[272:44.92]And before I go, I'm going to read some bits.
[272:46.92]Because I did not read them for the last 20 minutes or so.
