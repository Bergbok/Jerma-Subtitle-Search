[00:59.00]Good afternoon.
[01:01.20]Why did I just say that like I was a college professor?
[01:04.32]Good afternoon students, please have a seat.
[01:07.07]Today we're going to talk about monsters in the wild.
[01:11.63]Hunting them.
[01:12.75]Tracking them.
[01:15.43]You know.
[01:15.71]Please open your textbooks.
[01:19.83]Page one.
[01:21.07]We started one here in my class.
[01:25.79]Some of your teachers might have you start at page like 90 something or like 112 or something like that.
[01:31.61]Not here.
[01:33.77]My textbook starts at page 1.
[01:38.97]You forgot your textbook?
[01:43.19]I have a three forget your textbook policy.
[01:47.15]You forget it once, shame on you.
[01:49.79]You forget it twice, shame on you again.
[01:53.49]You forget it three times, fucking shame on you.
[01:57.51]Get out of my classroom.
[01:59.11]You're out.
[02:01.69]Get an automatic D. But give me a minute, guys.
[02:08.32]I'll be right back.
[02:41.45]You don't feel good?
[02:42.13]Can you go home early?
[02:42.99]Hold on.
[02:46.61]Switch over to the game.
[02:56.94]Okay.
[02:58.20]Can you go home early?
[03:01.66]Yeah.
[03:02.58]I don't want to keep you here if you're sick.
[03:04.91]That's not cool.
[03:11.20]Let me just move some stuff around.
[03:13.44]That looks good.
[03:16.08]That looks swell.
[03:23.01]And... Hey, thank you, GridKid87 for the two months.

[03:39.13]No, okay, here's my bathroom policy.
[03:41.35]I'm one of those teachers that has a bathroom key.
[03:45.65]And if you lose it, you gotta pay me 50 bucks.

[04:13.37]What a bad teacher.
[04:17.25]Oh, shit.
[04:18.07]You know, I need a new mic setup.
[04:21.29]My mic setup is so bad.
[04:22.77]I have this fucking, like, 1980s microphone stand.
[04:26.88]And, like, a wicked expensive new cool microphone.
[04:30.66]What a dummy, you know?
[04:34.38]So, I... Are iPhones allowed in class?
[04:38.74]No.
[04:41.20]Unless you're taking, like, cool pictures of me.
[04:43.18]Know what I mean?
[04:47.40]You can bring your iPhone to class as long as, like, you're snapping some cool shots of me, like, pointing my finger, putting my hand on my chin, you know, pointing in the sky with my mouth open, like I'm talking about something important, you know?
[05:04.18]And you gotta post that on Twitter and on Facebook.
[05:07.38]As like, damn, my professor knows his shit.
[05:10.25]He's so regal.

[06:05.90]Because I have... I guess I... Does it have to be in a certain slot or something?
[06:17.52]I don't get it.
[06:21.30]We'll look at this later.
[06:22.32]I know that I want attack ones, but... Skills are a little bit complicated.
[06:26.68]I can only imagine how complicated they may be.
[06:33.18]Use the auto-guard charm.
[06:36.64]How do I put it on?
[06:37.32]Oh, it's only materials.
[06:47.45]Let me go dump this stuff in my box.
[06:56.18]When you hear your teacher peeing while you take the test.
[07:03.32]Yeah, we're going to be going for a long time here, guys.
[07:06.68]This is going to be a fairly long stream to make up for the fact that I did not do one yesterday.
[07:13.77]Am I going to run for president?
[07:20.85]No.
[07:24.74]Check talismans.
[07:26.42]Is it under equipment?
[07:27.96]There it is.
[07:28.36]New talismans.
[07:29.02]Auto guard plus 10.
[07:32.39]Should I just put it on?
[07:35.39]It's on.
[07:37.67]What does that do?
[07:39.55]What are we learning today?
[07:40.61]I don't know.
[07:44.13]What are we learning today?
[07:45.51]We're learning how to do things very, very slowly in this game.
[07:49.62]Equipment sets?
[07:52.78]Register equipment.
[07:54.36]Oh, you can change sets.
[07:55.52]That's cool.
[07:58.40]Eternal streaming.
[07:59.26]Free auto-guard now?
[08:00.08]What does auto-guard do?
[08:05.79]What does the honey and bitter bug do?
[08:08.55]Catalyst.
[08:12.05]I need blue mushrooms.
[08:13.86]So we're going to be real boring here.
[08:16.54]And we're just going to go collect blue mushrooms for the first 20 minutes of the stream.
[08:19.46]Hope you guys are ready.
[08:20.00]Let me just talk to this guy first.
[08:34.85]Oh, no.
[08:36.77]So, now... So, every boss that you fight in this game... Does that translate to now they're in the wild and they'll just show up in random places?
[08:53.22]Resources... Dung... Cactus Flower, Earth Crystal... Why can't I... No, I need two Cactus Flower.
[09:06.84]Well, I can't do any of these at the moment.
[09:08.14]So, whatever.
[09:09.26]Resource info.
[09:10.24]Whatever.
[09:16.44]Some exceptions.
[09:17.12]Okay.
[09:20.80]Send items to Fox.
[09:27.57]Alright.
[09:29.25]Let's go get some mushrooms.
[09:32.71]Can we have class outside today?
[09:36.17]I forgot that people used to do that.
[09:40.34]Let's just go get mushrooms.
[09:41.62]Oh, thank you Opal for the 10 months.
[09:43.88]And Spectag for 12 months a year.
[09:47.94]Hello, Jeremy.
[09:48.52]Great stream, man.
[09:49.39]Is there nobody you can play this with?
[09:52.77]Well, you have to assume that one of my friends has a Wii U. And, like, nobody does.
[10:00.52]I'm going to play online today.
[10:02.60]I'm going to check it out.
[10:04.74]After, maybe we'll kill, like, a boss or two, maybe.
[10:07.34]I'll go check it out.
[10:10.10]So, if, like, there's a way that we can play somehow.
[10:11.97]If, like, anybody has it, we can just jump in, like, a lobby, maybe.
[10:14.09]Mushrooms.
[10:21.40]But they're okay to take anyways.
[10:24.12]The servers are offline?
[10:25.92]What?
[10:31.90]I didn't touch my Wii U in like a year and a half.
[10:40.13]Alright.
[10:40.65]Now I need mushrooms.
[10:41.31]Let's just... We're gonna skip this.
[10:42.65]We're gonna go right to the mushrooms.
[10:45.35]Which aren't they usually in the caves?
[10:52.64]But thank you for the sub.
[10:53.56]Thank you also to... Bangle Harry Basement for the sub.

[11:15.72]And Major598 for ten months.
[11:17.16]Thanks, man.
[11:19.67]No cat cam.
[11:20.79]What a dog streamer.
[11:21.89]Well, I don't have a cat.
[11:25.90]I do not have a kitty cat.
[11:27.52]I have a little diggity dog.
[11:28.88]Yeah, this is the Wii U version.
[11:38.48]It's not 3DS.
[11:44.74]Craft jaggy weapons.
[11:48.41]I just upgraded this weapon.
[11:49.69]I wonder what it takes to do it again.
[11:58.38]I'm sure I will find out.
[12:01.26]Any other mushrooms?
[12:02.36]There's honey over here.
[12:03.00]Might as well just get it.
[12:03.70]No, no, no, no.
[12:05.34]We're on a mushroom collection binge right now.
[12:08.88]And there's a little... There's a jag eye.
[12:12.49]See you later.
[12:16.89]Mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms.
[12:21.35]Gotta get a monster spreadsheet.
[12:24.73]Yeah, I've heard this game is... It's kind of like The Binding of Isaac, where you just want a wiki page open next to you at all times.
[12:39.30]You want to upgrade by getting helicocyte ore.
[12:42.63]Next tier of sharpness green.
[12:44.43]Yeah, isn't that in the next area?
[12:45.87]The sand area that I was in before?
[12:53.57]Still doing sword and shield.
[12:57.20]Hey, get out of here.
[12:59.32]Whoops.
[13:01.32]You're like, this guy's like too small for me to hit him.
[13:03.14]Oh, he's dead.
[13:08.05]What do these guys have?
[13:09.75]Anything interesting?
[13:13.55]Oh!
[13:14.41]GG extract!
[13:15.69]A lot of mines down here.
[13:20.05]Can only get it in the third area.
[13:26.91]Okay.
[13:27.93]Oh shit, get off me.
[13:35.23]Mmm.
[13:49.50]One thing I don't like about this weapon is when you have it in your back, right?
[13:55.53]And if I want to just swing at this guy, like, oh, let me take my sword out and swing at him.
[13:59.09]We're going to jump over him.
[14:07.08]But whatever.
[14:16.79]I'm supposed to be getting blue mushrooms.
[14:28.24]Yeah, I heard about the whole elemental thing.
[14:30.07]I want to make this an elemental sword and shield.
[14:32.81]Right?
[14:33.19]Because it doesn't do a whole lot of damage, but...
[14:39.83]can proc more elemental damage because it goes faster or something.
[14:44.71]I don't know.
[14:45.61]We'll find out.
[14:51.02]Right now, this is item collection part of the stream.
[14:57.98]I want like a good 10 blue mushrooms.
[15:00.76]Don't do forward X. I guess, yeah.
[15:06.52]It's so hard.
[15:07.14]It's so hard to not do forward and X.
[15:11.37]That's gonna be hard to not do.
[15:14.73]I'm fucking mushrooms, man.
[15:16.03]What's this?
[15:19.52]Ooh, fossils.
[15:24.12]Give me some shrooms.
[15:24.88]I need some blue mushrooms.
[15:25.80]I don't want to cultivate them.
[15:26.76]I want to get them.
[15:31.25]Get your resident sleepers ready.
[15:39.70]I want a bunch of mega potions.
[15:42.32]Is there some certain area where blue mushrooms spawn more?
[15:45.20]Or does it not really matter?
[15:46.88]Could they just be anywhere?
[15:56.02]Mushrooms, mushrooms, mushrooms.
[15:59.16]Area 2 should have a lot of mushrooms.
[16:03.07]Let's go to area 2.
[16:08.24]Am I gonna play Nioh?
[16:09.12]Yes.
[16:13.02]Absolutely.
[16:16.66]Hey, look at that.
[16:17.66]Perfect.
[16:17.96]Yeah, we're gonna play Nioh... Dude, next week.
[16:24.18]Like, this coming, like, next week into the next month.
[16:26.17]I hope you guys are, like, ready for next week's stream, dude.
[16:31.29]We're doing fucking full-on VR Resident Evil 7.
[16:36.65]Oh, get out of here.
[16:37.27]Come on.
[16:37.89]I just want to pick mushrooms up.
[16:39.96]Should I just fight him?
[16:45.84]Maybe I should just kill him.
[16:51.07]I feel like this is going to take a lot longer than I want.
[17:00.96]Nah, I don't even want to fight him.
[17:02.80]Just pick mushrooms.
[17:05.90]I really don't want to fight this guy right now, but he's standing in the way of the mushroom.
[17:12.24]Oh, I just got existentialism.
[17:19.71]Good thing ChaCha can just distract him, because I don't even care.
[17:25.94]Resident Evil?
[17:26.56]More like Resident Sleeper.
[17:29.74]Yeah, we're doing a full, like, full VR facecam Resident Evil 7 pantshit stream.
[17:41.04]This will be good after this.
[17:41.74]I can just go back.
[17:44.70]Throw poop in his face and he'll run away.
[17:46.12]Yeah, but I can just run away.
[17:50.44]I just want 10 blue mushrooms.
[17:54.14]Come on.
[17:56.04]Alright, he missed.
[17:56.88]Good.
[17:58.16]Can you fast travel?
[17:59.20]Yeah, you can.
[18:09.88]I'm glad you can do that in combat.
[18:12.36]It makes things easier.
[18:13.16]Now let's go combine these.
[18:16.17]Let's make some mega potions.
[18:27.57]Not even putting them in my storage.
[18:39.02]What does Excite Shroom do?
[18:40.14]I'm gonna have to take a look at that in a second.
[18:50.13]Combo books?
[18:50.79]Wait, what do you mean combo books?
[18:59.15]Are there combo books in this game?
[19:04.20]Buy combo books so you don't have any failed combos.
[19:08.56]Oh, only 95%.
[19:09.88]That's almost impossible for me not to get it.
[19:21.23]Of course that shit happens right when I say that, huh?
[19:23.07]Alright, let's go do that.
[19:37.79]Oh well.
[19:43.31]Okay, combo books.
[19:47.34]Does this lady have them or no?
[19:51.66]One of my other people.
[19:53.38]A book of combos, one.
[19:55.80]Proves your combination success rate.
[19:57.20]Okay.
[20:00.99]Now what the fuck do I do with this shit?
[20:05.79]Book of combos.
[20:09.18]Does it matter where it is?
[20:11.72]Does it just have to sit like a Diablo II charm in the box?
[20:24.43]I also need... Make sure I don't forget.
[20:26.27]Make sure I do not forget to buy whetstones.
[20:29.27]Because I need like fucking 20 of them.
[20:34.80]Alright.
[20:37.08]Let's see.
[20:37.72]So I wanted blue money.
[20:39.06]No, I wanted honey.
[20:42.74]And potion.
[20:47.85]95%.
[20:49.63]Come on.
[20:50.01]Give me all these.
[20:54.79]What the fuck?
[20:56.44]Ah!
[20:56.54]Ah!
[20:58.61]That sucks, dude.
[21:01.96]Excite Shroom and... What's it gonna do here?
[21:12.26]Mega Nutrients?
[21:13.49]No.
[21:17.67]Earth Crystal and Bitter Bug does what?
[21:22.61]Antiseptic Stone.
[21:29.60]Cool.
[21:29.80]Alright.
[21:34.76]Let's go back.
[21:38.40]I really should have ten regular potions too, right?
[21:44.87]Need to eat.
[21:45.35]Alright, so what mundane shit quest am I gonna do?
[21:54.01]How many pickaxes do I have?
[21:55.92]Four?
[21:56.34]That's fine.
[21:56.90]Ah, good.
[21:59.71]Just max out on them.
[22:00.77]There's no reason not to.
[22:03.45]Mmm.
[22:07.23]Tranquilizer.
[22:08.19]I don't need any traps right now.
[22:12.32]Alright, blightstone.
[22:23.29]14.
[22:23.77]Let's just buy...
[22:28.84]A 16.
[22:32.22]Okay.
[22:32.90]Cool drink.
[22:33.54]I'm gonna buy a couple of these, too.
[22:36.75]Just because we're going to the desert.
[22:43.81]Let's see what she's got.
[22:46.91]Level 1.
[22:47.27]Let's just look.
[22:48.17]You know, why don't we take a look?
[22:52.67]I wish I could see what these reward.
[22:54.26]Like, what you get for doing these.
[22:56.96]Is it just 600 money?
[23:00.52]1500.
[23:00.64]Dip a rock in the river.
[23:09.16]The deadliest catch.
[23:10.86]Slay seven Ludroff.
[23:13.83]Let's not do that one yet.
[23:14.75]Let's do... Survive until time expires or deliver a paw pass ticket.
[23:19.87]Should I just do this one?
[23:29.47]600 whole money, yeah.
[23:31.57]I think you Ant-Man 74 for the sub.
[23:33.68]Better Mixmaster for the 11 months.
[23:36.62]And Captain Dark, thanks for the two months, man.
[23:43.92]Hunt a Royal Ludroth.
[23:47.05]Am I ready for this?
[23:47.81]I don't think I'm ready for this shit.
[23:54.07]I don't think I'm ready to fight this guy.
[23:57.53]No, not yet.
[23:58.81]Not a great Rorgi.
[23:59.99]Like, these are bosses.
[24:00.79]These are scary bosses.
[24:06.44]Let's just kill six, uh, Rhinopoluses.
[24:10.68]Yeah.
[24:10.96]We're gonna kill the... We're doing this.
[24:12.52]We're gonna kill Rhinopolis.
[24:14.04]Get six of them.
[24:17.44]Do it.
[24:17.87]Do it.
[24:18.39]Alright.
[24:19.21]Done.
[24:19.59]No, not done.
[24:20.31]Because I need to eat.
[24:25.90]I have a good number of potions.
[24:27.64]Maybe I'll be okay.
[24:29.60]Let's do a cheese moss.
[24:33.98]Let's do a moss and cheese dinner.
[24:44.48]Ludroth is easier than the Coropeco?
[24:46.44]Oh, alright.
[24:47.48]That's easy enough.
[24:49.64]Whetstones?
[24:50.06]I already got Whetstones.
[24:53.05]But I'm going to change the order here, sort this.
[25:04.04]Let's make this nice and clean before we do this.
[25:14.27]Eight mega potions.
[25:17.85]And... Hmm...
[25:24.36]I think that's all I care about.
[25:25.48]Okay.
[25:34.19]Item pouch.
[25:34.89]Let's make this better.
[25:39.45]Um... Clean the inventory up a little bit.
[25:55.82]That works for me.
[25:57.24]I'm ready to go.
[25:58.72]Let's go kill a super Ludroth.
[26:02.82]I've eaten.
[26:03.22]It's time to do something.
[26:09.68]Use armor spheres.
[26:10.46]I did last time.
[26:12.04]But maybe I can do it again.
[26:13.28]We'll just try this one.
[26:15.70]Save our boat.

[30:20.84]I just want to play.
[30:28.93]I said this last time, but it's like, some people get so angry at the fact that I've never played this game before.
[30:38.40]And there's somebody at his house right now, like, fucking clenching his asshole, gripping the bottom of his chair like, You need to get the fuck in that water!
[30:47.60]Hurry the fuck up!
[30:49.36]I know this to be true, but you don't.

[31:06.37]Please don't be mad at me.
[31:07.75]I can't go in the water.
[31:08.53]I have to go this way.
[31:17.20]Wait, what?
[31:23.12]How could you not know the thing that I know?
[31:26.64]You piece of shit.
[31:30.19]You know what?
[31:30.59]I'm outta here.
[31:32.40]This guy didn't know the thing that I knew.
[31:33.81]No, he hasn't played.
[31:34.41]He has no idea.
[31:35.09]I played this.
[31:35.59]He hasn't.
[31:36.23]How dare he?
[31:37.07]How dare he?
[31:43.42]Please stop being passive-aggressive.
[31:47.50]No, sometimes I look over at chat and people are actually really fucking mad at me.
[31:53.01]Like, angry with me.
[32:03.50]I don't want you to be angry with me.
[32:04.84]I want us to have fun.
[32:10.45]This is awkward.
[32:23.31]Hmm, aim up.
[32:29.21]He's dead.
[32:30.11]What about his friend?
[32:33.23]Now for the underwater portion.
[32:37.41]Still alive?
[32:37.93]No.
[32:42.01]Well, I don't see... Is this some kind of currency thing?
[32:51.04]Go play Mario if you want to have fun.
[32:57.38]You think this is about fun?
[32:59.68]Go play that fucking little Super Mario game if you want to have fun.
[33:07.01]What is over here?
[33:08.25]Looks like a little cave.
[33:12.47]Don't say the C word.
[33:16.07]Oh, well, I don't think he's here.
[33:17.71]Unless there's something I have to do.
[33:19.05]Let's go.
[33:23.81]Put this away and swim faster, please.
[33:35.52]What?
[33:35.70]You want me to go play Super Mario?
[33:43.36]That didn't hit him?
[33:53.27]Come here, you.
[33:59.30]Oh boy.
[34:01.48]Alright, please, just, I want you to turn.
[34:03.82]Go slowly.
[34:05.30]And grind his bones up.
[34:09.14]Immature sponge, yeah.
[34:13.72]That's... That's what I am.
[34:16.26]Just an immature sponge.
[34:20.02]I'm gonna go this way.
[34:20.46]I'm gonna go down the six.
[34:28.43]Ooh.
[34:31.19]Lots more.
[34:35.91]Big dude.
[34:43.23]Dead?
[34:44.47]Dead.
[34:51.78]Come on, get over there and do it.
[34:57.48]Is this game as hard as Dark Souls?
[35:00.46]Hmm?
[35:03.01]I think they're kind of... They're different in terms of difficulty.
[35:05.53]I think Dark Souls is a... Like, harder game.
[35:11.69]But there's a lot less you need to know about Dark Souls.
[35:18.90]This is just like mechanically, I think, not as hard as Dark Souls, but there's so much more information that you have to know that, you know.
[35:29.25]Why am I playing 3 Ultimate?
[35:30.47]Because I have no way to capture my 3DS unless I send it in and have a device implanted into the back of it, which I didn't do.
[35:43.92]It will be.
[35:52.09]Anything else here?
[36:01.28]It's much more difficult later on.
[36:04.78]Yeah, I can see that.
[36:06.61]I think Dark Souls is just consistently hard from beginning to end.
[36:10.73]Where this game is not that difficult in the very beginning, but there's a lot to learn and then it must get harder.
[36:19.30]Might just be talking up my ass.
[36:22.32]Half the game is just preparing for a fight.
[36:26.16]Yeah.
[36:33.37]The later monsters are harder than anything in Dark Souls.
[36:36.19]Shit, I'm already full.
[36:39.02]Really?
[36:43.72]Man.
[36:45.62]Hey, well this is the Pelagosite ore.
[36:48.26]Monster guts, I...
[36:53.56]I'm just gonna... Damn it.
[36:59.31]Let's see if I can get something besides a stone.
[37:01.13]Just discard it.
[37:01.87]Okay, that's perfect.
[37:03.05]Alright, ore.
[37:09.06]Let's keep going.
[37:09.84]Let's go to four.
[37:17.18]Found him!
[37:24.07]Ooh, he looks like a lion.
[37:30.30]I have to fight this guy underwater, don't I?
[37:31.98]Why not?
[37:40.64]Hmm.
[37:42.90]Okay.
[37:47.59]Ding!
[37:48.41]Where is he?
[37:48.73]Alright, time to concentrate.
[37:51.47]Should I take this...
[37:55.88]Where is he?
[37:57.30]Oh, there he is.
[38:04.13]Let's max out here.
[38:14.15]Hello.
[38:17.05]What?
[38:18.03]Come on now.
[38:25.68]Don't lock me in don't lock me in here.
[38:27.28]Oh my god.
[38:28.86]No, no, I Just want to throw a fucking paintball at him.
[38:34.85]I swear to God.
[38:36.25]I swear to God.
[38:36.99]I swear to God.
[38:37.89]I swear to God What a fucking disaster
[38:45.28]He's getting stuck in these little shits.
[38:46.76]I should have just killed them.
[38:47.92]You annoying little fucks.
[38:50.17]Oh!
[38:50.99]Fucking angry.
[38:56.37]They're just dead.
[38:57.17]I touched them once and they died.
[39:05.32]Words can't even describe how much this is going to light up my ass right now.
[39:16.07]I cut his tail.
[39:16.73]I feel like that's a vulnerable part of his body.
[39:19.05]I think so, right?
[39:30.95]20 minutes and he's already raging.
[39:32.67]It's just finicky shit like that just really gets under my skin.
[39:36.24]It really does.
[39:39.06]Having to, like, line up, line up, line up, line up, and then you fucking... I just did.
[39:43.44]Go look this up.
[39:45.50]Go look up, um... What was the pitcher's name?
[39:49.89]Hold on.
[39:50.41]Give me a second.
[39:52.07]You know when the pitcher, like, whips a fucking... Does, like, a full wind-up?
[39:56.53]And then throws the thing over the dugout?
[40:00.35]And it's a huge, funny thing.
[40:01.79]It's like, oh, wow, I can't believe that, Mike.
[40:04.37]He threw that ball into the dugout.
[40:06.37]Something must have went wrong there.
[40:10.35]Something went wrong there.
[40:14.47]I'm not complaining.
[40:15.77]This is not a complaining stream.
[40:20.81]You can use your weapons.
[40:21.97]Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
[40:23.75]I've been doing it.
[40:32.49]Change back to Mega Potion.
[40:34.03]Thankfully, this guy's not that difficult.
[40:39.63]Mike Piazza?
[40:50.21]Mike Piazza's baseball.
[40:53.49]Starring me, Mike Piazza.
[40:58.79]And he's gone.
[41:01.71]Why is it... I did get him with the paintball.
[41:04.15]So why am I... What happened?
[41:08.06]He's marked right now.
[41:09.88]Why is he marked?
[41:13.16]Should he be marked right now?
[41:15.78]Something tells me he shouldn't be marked.
[41:28.61]Roblox over here.
[41:33.11]No, come back this way.
[41:35.25]Come over here.
[41:43.76]Shit.
[41:46.23]I hit him with the first one, did I?
[41:47.37]I didn't even think I did.
[41:55.49]I need to lure you back this way.
[41:56.79]I don't want to have to fight you over there.
[42:01.44]Over here, you fucking piece of taffy.
[42:04.24]Taffy boss.
[42:11.63]Oh, my lord.
[42:12.97]Please!
[42:18.52]Oh.
[42:19.44]What happened to me?
[42:23.10]Stamina's all screwed up now?
[42:25.70]Well, that looks like it hurt a lot.
[42:32.25]Looks like I could hit him right in the face.
[42:39.36]Ow, that hurts.
[42:41.86]Please get up, please.
[42:44.24]Yeah, keep running into the wall.
[42:58.36]That works for me.
[43:09.69]The tail?
[43:10.67]I'm trying.
[43:13.03]He moves, he wickers around too much.
[43:17.51]Come here, let me see that tail.
[43:30.94]He's freaking out.
[43:37.42]Why are you freaking out so much?
[43:45.63]Get in that water.
[43:46.63]Get in that fucking water right now.
[44:04.97]There he goes.
[44:05.55]He's back to three.
[44:26.53]Shit.
[44:27.29]I tried to dodge.
[44:28.25]There's nowhere I can go though.
[44:29.11]Kill his little friends.
[44:29.89]And deal with him after.
[44:36.09]Still alive?
[44:39.36]I guess so.
[44:43.70]What is he doing?
[44:45.20]He is freaking the fuck out.
[44:52.27]I didn't want to go in the water, but apparently I did.
[45:00.27]I don't want to zone to the next area.
[45:07.31]How much more times do I have to hit you?
[45:22.55]In your tail area.
[45:24.45]Oh, fuck it.
[45:24.91]Whatever.
[45:30.73]Okay, I'm just getting super greedy now.
[45:32.31]I gotta calm down.
[45:35.59]Nope.
[45:36.45]Nope.
[45:37.15]Nope.
[45:37.71]Holy shit.
[45:43.64]You're not gonna stay in there, are you?
[45:49.58]Can I, like, poison knife him?
[45:57.41]I don't want to fight you in the water.
[45:58.67]Come out of the water.
[45:59.39]Come on.
[46:00.38]I don't want to fight you in there.
[46:01.32]That's your home turf.
[46:03.08]Cha-cha.
[46:03.50]Leave him alone so he doesn't... He has the advantage in here.
[46:10.93]He's long and slender.
[46:25.85]I gotta get him out of here.
[46:27.07]This is unbearable.
[46:31.71]Oh, it's this un-fucking-bearable.
[46:33.77]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[46:35.41]Please.
[46:38.25]Get out of the fucking water, my god!
[46:42.27]Come on.
[46:43.53]Come over here.
[46:44.89]Come eat me.
[46:47.25]Complain stream.
[46:49.19]I actually have to fight him in here, don't I?
[46:53.08]Do your little thing where you jump out and make a funny face.
[46:58.24]Oh boy.
[46:59.00]Alright, there he is.
[47:13.79]I hit the tail.
[47:17.41]Get back in that water.
[47:23.37]I don't want to fight you in there.
[47:25.37]You little shit.
[47:26.27]Wait, he's running away.
[47:31.40]The race is on.
[47:42.66]He is a pretty handsome banana, isn't he?
[47:51.32]This is where it goes to hell.
[47:56.09]Yep.
[47:56.29]This is where me fighting this guy shits the bed.
[48:06.28]There's no land here.
[48:11.50]Great.
[48:12.30]Okay, let's go.
[48:19.49]We're
[48:21.74]Come here!
[48:23.00]But I bounced off him.
[48:35.57]Just drop a toaster in here, or a battery.
[48:38.79]Yeah, flex in the water.
[48:45.65]Show me your muscles.
[49:02.73]I love how there's just a random fish here just hanging out.
[49:16.16]Hit the tail!
[49:16.70]Hit the tail!
[49:23.68]Can I pull him out of the water here?
[49:27.82]I'm just curious if there's like a place I can go.
[49:29.84]No, I don't think so.
[49:32.14]I think I have to fight him under here, don't I?
[49:36.83]I lost the paintball as well.
[49:44.99]This is my summer guard.
[49:52.57]I gotta watch my breath here.
[50:05.85]Good luck whetstoning underwater.
[50:08.93]Can I not do that?
[50:11.47]I can't whetstone underwater?
[50:12.77]Oh, that sucks.
[50:18.14]I wonder how much longer this is gonna take.
[50:38.40]Oh, you can do everything underwater?
[50:41.24]Then I'm not concerned.
[50:44.34]I should probably get it ready, considering it's probably going to be a big deal in a minute here.
[50:56.09]It's like, every time I get close to him, he decides to dash away, and then... Come on, stay right there.
[51:08.46]His bananas can absorb those hits.
[51:16.11]Oh, that hurt.
[51:19.17]That hurt.
[51:19.65]That hurt too.
[51:27.05]He's in trouble.
[51:30.01]No, don't swim away.
[51:31.05]I don't know where you're gonna go.
[51:32.67]Please, let me just get him done.
[51:38.60]No.
[51:42.34]No, don't go.
[51:43.92]Don't go.
[51:44.52]I don't know where you're gonna be.
[51:45.46]I mean, he has to be right here, right?
[51:52.82]There's nowhere else he could be.
[51:58.91]There he is.
[51:59.27]Good.
[51:59.65]Thank God.
[52:06.67]That's Whetstone.
[52:09.81]Find an opportunity to.
[52:16.73]Good.
[52:29.78]Won't be long now.
[52:31.18]I can sense it.
[52:40.97]Right in the head.
[52:41.63]Come here.
[52:55.70]I like the dashing underneath them thing.
[52:57.57]That seems to work fairly well.
[53:11.45]Ow.
[53:12.01]I'm going to heal here.
[53:12.83]I don't feel like getting caught somehow and dying.
[53:15.11]Alright, can somebody... Please tell me this is the only underwater boss that's in the whole game.
[53:35.31]Okay.
[53:40.59]Alright, I've got good.
[53:41.59]This is the only underwater encounter in the entire game.
[53:44.01]Alright, good.
[53:50.12]They made all these underwater places just for only this one boss.
[53:53.92]Right in the face, right in the face!
[54:11.70]Gotta be getting so close.
[54:14.05]There are seven.
[54:27.85]Die!
[54:30.43]Die!
[54:30.77]You're making me look bad!
[54:32.45]You're making me look bad, boss!
[54:53.42]Stupid dog.
[54:54.48]You make me look bad.
[54:56.98]Look up, look up, look up, look up.
[54:58.82]Hey, get out of here.
[55:09.13]Get out of here, random fish.
[55:31.52]Why do I have to give him the most annoying voice too?
[55:33.86]That was a mistake.
[55:49.17]He's going crazy.
[55:52.05]I was right in the face.
[55:55.32]I have a question for all you Monster Hunter people that know things about this game.
[56:01.83]Does every boss fight take like 30 minutes?
[56:06.25]Regardless of the weapon you're using.
[56:10.13]Am I destined to be fighting the same guy for like at least 15 minutes straight every time?
[56:24.07]Yes, more or less.
[56:26.43]I'm just curious.
[56:26.89]I just want to make sure that this is not like, oh, holy shit, you are doing something so wrong.
[56:30.19]Alright, I'm starting to... I gotta, like, snap out of my catatonic state I'm in right now.
[56:42.55]Just kill him.
[57:07.09]You beat a great Jag guy, remember, a minute later on?
[57:09.77]That's cool.
[57:10.19]I just want to make sure I wasn't doing something, like, catastrophically incorrect.
[57:15.45]Where, like, they're like, oh.
[57:18.33]Shouldn't take, like, 15 to 20 minutes to kill this guy.
[57:30.75]I need to go up for air, because... I'm gonna die if I don't.
[57:36.90]I need a whetstone.
[57:41.16]Not a mini whetstone, but, you know, it's okay.
[57:53.32]Back to the fight.
[57:55.02]What?
[58:02.17]Swim.
[58:03.77]Swim, you fool.
[58:06.63]I'm using a weapon that's really shitty for solo hunts.
[58:11.99]Well, kind of upgraded it once already, so I think I need to stick with it.
[58:17.94]Let's just get to max.
[58:19.00]Just do a full whetstone.
[58:20.48]Please don't hit me.
[58:26.54]Where's Cha-Cha?
[58:27.12]Cha-Cha, will you, like, do something, please, while I get this to max?
[58:31.70]Alright, now I can at least get on land.
[58:34.08]This isn't as painful as it was previously.
[58:39.64]Where's the land here?
[58:40.44]I'm gonna get up to the surface and find it.
[58:46.41]What?
[58:51.18]Alright, you know, we could turn this into a complaint stream.
[58:55.40]And that complaint is, while you're in combat, you should not be able to, like, zone.
[58:59.58]Alright, come over here.
[59:04.25]Hey, this way.
[59:13.59]Let's go.
[59:15.41]Come get me.
[59:20.66]Come on.
[59:21.36]Don't look at Cha-Cha.
[59:22.13]Cha-Cha, come back.
[59:22.77]Can I command Cha-Cha to come over here?
[59:30.70]Finally.
[59:32.46]Finally, we're back on land.
[60:21.73]I really hope he dies soon because this is really starting to become excruciatingly boring.
[60:28.72]If I'm totally honest.
[60:48.72]Save ChaCha.
[60:53.46]What's wrong with ChaCha?
[60:54.51]He's alright.
[61:03.68]He's gonna die right like he's limping he's dead right he's like puking over here He's dead he's gonna die so soon okay, please please kill him

[61:34.04]Shit.
[61:40.32]Come over here.
[61:41.24]Follow me.
[61:42.16]Follow your nose.
[61:46.93]Oh, god damn it.
[61:52.03]He's moving so much faster now, too.
[62:08.72]Move.
[62:10.16]Move.
[62:14.03]Oh my god.
[62:24.83]Take the... With companions... How many companions can you get?
[62:38.64]Thank God.
[62:38.98]No, no, my lord.
[62:40.21]My lord in heaven.
[62:42.21]Like... Just, please move.
[62:45.51]I don't even know where he's gonna be now.
[62:53.47]I have no idea.
[63:01.09]Like... What the fuck?
[63:22.74]I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
[63:25.79]I'm gonna keep my mouth shut right now.
[63:27.15]I don't see him.
[63:54.71]Wait.
[64:03.44]There he is.
[64:04.06]Okay.
[64:06.14]Let me get this shit maximum.
[64:16.53]Let's hope I can beat him.
[64:19.99]I'm trying to change my- Okay, you guys saw what I just did there, right?
[64:24.29]You saw the lower right.
[64:25.41]I was scrolling.
[64:26.07]I just was scrolling.
[64:29.17]What the fuck was that?
[64:37.06]Well, good luck.
[64:39.90]Hopefully I don't die.
[64:40.88]And after all that time, his tail is finally off.
[64:54.73]Wow.
[64:56.49]Okay.
[65:13.52]Loot the tail.
[65:16.35]Holy shit!
[65:21.25]Oh my god, I really did need to loot the tail.
[65:23.41]You guys weren't kidding.
[65:27.33]I thought you guys were just making like a Dark Souls joke.
[65:29.61]Alright, it's not good.
[65:32.98]I gotta stop looking at chat.
[65:34.36]I don't want to lose this right now.
[65:35.30]This would be a fucking disaster.
[65:38.48]This would be a literal disaster if I lose it.
[66:07.66]He got, like, harder with his tail up.
[66:12.46]Rolled into that.
[66:31.67]Get out of the fucking water, please.
[66:35.22]No, don't go in the water, please.
[66:43.28]Don't go in the water.
[66:44.10]Die!
[67:02.13]I'm looking for him to do.
[67:02.91]I'm gonna just be reactionary.
[67:03.99]I'm not going in.
[67:06.45]Wait, the roll is what gets me.
[67:08.09]Do the roll.
[67:11.70]Here we go.
[67:14.96]Shit!
[67:19.52]Ten minutes!
[67:20.12]I'm gonna hit the fucking enrage timer.
[67:36.84]So I gotta thank you for the health, you fucking absolute legend, Cha-Cha.
[67:52.35]Whoa!
[67:55.09]Whoa!
[68:04.02]Whoa!
[68:04.84]No!
[68:16.21]Come on, die already, please.
[68:21.51]Die.
[68:21.99]Die.
[68:26.37]No.
[68:30.97]No.
[68:32.43]No.
[68:34.72]Please die.
[68:37.90]Please die.
[68:39.40]Luke the shiny.
[68:40.30]I don't care about it.
[68:41.64]I have ten minutes.
[68:48.33]No, please.
[68:51.09]Please.
[68:53.25]Get me out of this fucking nightmare.
[68:57.75]He needs to die now.
[69:01.64]He needs to die right now.
[69:06.02]Oh my god, I tried to dodge out of the way and he didn't dodge.
[69:09.64]I'm gonna lose.
[69:14.31]Yeah, this is where it's over.
[69:15.59]This is fucking, this is awful.
[69:25.92]I bounce off him twice.
[69:26.74]I bounce off him twice, really.
[69:42.51]Stop moving around.
[69:43.27]Just stop moving around for one second.
[69:45.19]And let me just hit you right in the face and then die.
[69:55.38]I got him!
[70:01.75]God, please.
[70:05.11]Oh god, my fucking whole body.
[70:14.32]Take it all.
[70:24.83]I gotta go get that other thing that's in there.
[70:26.21]How much time do I have?
[70:28.71]Which way was that?
[70:29.29]This way?
[70:35.48]Where's the shiny thing?
[70:37.84]Now change weapon.
[70:38.92]I actually think I might change weapon.
[70:42.32]I feel like this shouldn't be taking as long as it is to kill any of these things.
[70:45.22]Alright, where's the shiny?
[70:48.58]Shiny?
[70:51.27]Shiny?
[70:51.61]Where is it?
[70:53.83]Too late.
[71:07.92]Okay.
[71:09.44]Thank God.
[71:11.82]Okay.
[71:12.10]A praise?
[71:12.38]What did I get?
[71:13.62]What is it?
[71:15.32]Send equipment.
[71:16.34]Poison C+.
[71:40.74]Do I have it?
[71:51.36]Just send a box, right?
[71:56.71]Send a box.
[71:59.91]Is it useless?
[72:03.85]It's not good?
[72:11.20]That was a journey.
[72:12.02]That was a journey indeed.
[72:25.90]Don't do three star hunts with shitty weapons.
[72:35.34]Okay.
[72:36.08]Let me just take a look at something here.
[72:38.58]What does it take to upgrade this weapon now?
[72:48.04]I can do it.
[72:49.80]I can bring this.
[72:50.30]I need 4,000 and I can do it.
[72:54.50]Do I do that again or do I try a different weapon?
[73:09.11]Let's see what else there is.
[73:12.05]That's the wrong thing.
[73:15.59]Manage equipment.
[73:20.15]Just forge something better.
[73:22.31]Let me just see.
[73:24.31]The katana was kind of fun.
[73:26.33]I didn't mind the katana.
[73:33.74]Iron sword, katana.
[73:37.96]Iron hammer was cool.
[73:43.42]I wasn't a big fan of the bone axe.
[73:46.34]I think I might want to use the katana.
[73:55.53]Dual blades.
[73:56.23]It's similar to this.
[73:57.23]Yeah, I tried the dual blades yesterday.
[74:02.31]I'm thinking I want to try katana or hammer.
[74:12.04]The sword.
[74:12.62]Yeah, but I wasn't a big fan of the sword.
[74:14.53]I'm going to put the katana on.
[74:23.64]Now, should I upgrade the katana or should I forge a new one?
[74:33.48]What do you think?
[74:39.64]Iron Grace or Zeros Naginata?
[74:51.51]It's a massive katana.
[74:52.67]Forge.
[74:53.09]Forge.
[74:53.49]Forge.
[74:54.11]Forge.
[75:01.07]Long sword.
[75:01.69]Great sword.
[75:02.43]I don't know.
[75:09.28]Drowning shaft.
[75:10.84]What is that?
[75:11.68]Okay.
[75:11.96]I have... Alright.
[75:15.54]Alright.
[75:16.70]What do you think?
[75:19.80]Should I... Should I...
[75:28.59]Need green sharpness.
[75:36.35]Hmm.
[75:40.91]What the hell is that thing?
[75:43.74]I could do canine katana.
[75:45.16]What do you think?
[75:46.38]Canine?
[75:46.78]Just do canine?
[75:47.46]I mean, I can do it.
[75:48.12]I got plenty of shit.
[75:49.26]What do I need?
[75:49.66]Monster bone L?
[75:57.48]It's kind of cool looking.
[76:05.71]Or... Hold on.
[76:07.03]Forge weapon, longsword, canine.
[76:09.89]This is 297.
[76:11.27]The sharpness looks like that.
[76:17.49]Damn.
[76:19.92]This one's 330.
[76:20.32]Or I could get the canine and upgrade the canine.
[76:29.82]These are the choices.
[76:30.96]These are the choices.
[76:33.94]I think I'm going to do that.
[76:36.52]Yeah, we're going to forge the canine and we're going to upgrade it.
[76:44.87]Let's do it.
[76:50.31]Base every decision on whether or not it looks cool.
[76:55.83]Ooh, look at that.
[76:56.47]It does look kind of cool.
[76:57.33]Alright, upgrade canine.
[76:59.80]I need... Monster Bone M. M.
[77:05.89]I can do it right now if I had two monster bone M.
[77:07.71]363.
[77:09.31]Well.
[77:23.45]Okie dokie.
[77:28.24]Not bad.
[77:31.82]Monster bone M is easy.
[77:32.80]Where do you get monster bone M?
[77:35.64]Probably should have my Wikipedia page open.
[77:37.68]To the wiki.
[77:39.32]On to the wiki.
[77:39.84]Yeah, I just killed the royal ludrith.
[77:58.13]Hunting port.
[77:59.41]Yeah, whatever.
[78:04.49]Gold needle.
[78:07.19]Renaplos.
[78:08.45]I have a quest to kill Renaploses, don't I?
[78:10.17]Let's do that.
[78:15.15]Oh, chat.
[78:15.67]Yeah, you guys are my chat.
[78:17.03]The wiki page is this.
[78:18.49]Okay.
[78:25.59]Yeah, I could not do that.
[78:27.06]Not do that.
[78:27.52]Don't do that.
[78:27.98]Alright, whatever.
[78:30.26]Let's go do the runoff.
[78:31.00]Let's go get this thing upgraded again.
[78:32.34]Talk to the chief for a second.
[78:44.69]A new kind of monster.
[78:48.08]Cool.
[79:03.02]Give me some free shit.
[79:05.94]Large monster wandering the sandy plains.
[79:08.10]Bar off.
[79:10.94]Don't think I'm ready for that.
[79:18.06]Not ready for that.
[79:20.64]Here we go.
[79:21.56]Slay six, Runopolis.
[79:24.56]Runopolis, Rampage.
[79:25.48]We'll do it.
[79:27.15]First, let's buy some more food.
[79:32.07]Thorny meat and bread.
[79:41.03]No, Baroth is going to wreck you.
[79:44.15]Judging by how long that last one took, I ain't fighting another boss until I am fucking ready.
[79:53.14]I'm not doing it until I'm fucking ready.
[79:55.90]And I am not ready.
[79:58.28]I'm ready to kill rhinoceroses.
[80:00.86]That's it.
[80:01.22]I don't even need healing potions.
[80:10.43]I just need to kill six of these dumb rhinos.
[80:15.48]He's going to quit if he fights Barrow.
[80:21.75]Well, alrighty then.
[80:29.67]Cool drink, I can't take anymore.
[80:35.46]He's going to quit.
[80:39.55]There's been so many occasions.
[80:41.82]So far.
[80:42.30]Oh, I forgot.
[80:45.08]I forgot to fuck.
[80:48.48]I forgot.
[80:49.56]I forgot.
[80:50.32]I forgot.
[80:51.10]I forgot.
[80:52.20]Nice full inventory.
[80:55.03]It's alright.
[80:55.57]Don't worry.
[80:55.97]We'll be fine.
[80:57.17]What is it that kills six rhinoceroses?
[80:58.65]Can I dump any of this dumb shit?
[81:08.51]Throw it.
[81:10.89]Here, I'm gonna just waste these.
[81:12.33]I just need Monster Bone M. Alright, how do I use this weapon?
[81:28.54]Okay, let's... I need to read about this.
[81:34.98]Hunter info, loving guide, longsword.
[81:43.37]While moving, draw your longsword with the X button to immediately attack.
[81:47.85]Press the X button to step forward and slash.
[81:51.25]Press the A button to thrust.
[81:53.77]Press the X and A button to swing your blade while stepping back.
[81:58.40]If your sword is drawn, press the R button to begin spirit blade attacks.
[82:05.48]If your sword is put away, press the R, X, and A buttons all at once.
[82:10.92]After a spirit blade combo, press the R button to end with a spirit round slash.
[82:19.34]Hmm.
[82:20.80]Let's see what that does.
[82:22.38]This slash, so... Oh, sorry, Chacho.
[82:38.39]So you have to, like, charge the bar, I guess?
[82:43.86]So there's no combo with A, is there?
[82:46.74]Is it X and A?
[82:49.86]Okay.
[82:50.80]X, A. I'm gonna get this down.
[82:54.01]X, A. X, A. X, A, A. X, A, X. Seems to be a working combo.
[83:01.59]Okay.
[83:06.76]Both at the same time as a slash.
[83:09.38]Now can I do that into something else?
[83:12.42]This is a dash back.
[83:17.52]X, X, A, X. Okay, cool.
[83:24.73]X, X, A, A, A, X, X, X, X. And that's a little dodge.
[83:29.55]Alright, I like it.
[83:31.19]I like it.
[83:33.27]And I like how it's a giant crab leg.
[83:37.64]What was I doing?
[83:38.76]No.
[83:39.24]Let's talk to this guy.
[83:47.19]First aid.
[83:47.85]Thank you.
[83:48.09]I shouldn't be doing this right now.
[83:55.07]Let's go.
[83:56.23]I just gotta get some rhinos.
[83:57.72]We're good.
[83:59.68]Glad you did that.
[84:00.30]Glad you pressed Y. Fates lashes for getting out of shit.
[84:10.78]I was actually going to take a little bit of getting used to, because I've been playing the majority of the game with the sword and the shield, so this is much slower and more deliberate, but I think I'll probably like this better.
[84:40.40]You can dodge to the side with the Fade Slash?
[84:41.90]That's cool.
[84:59.15]I'm holding left and right right now.
[85:02.07]Seems to be dodging back still.
[85:10.17]alright rhinopolis that's is that a rhinopolis maybe oops
[85:34.87]Give me some Monster M Bones, my friend.
[85:40.04]Monster Bone M. There it is.
[85:41.18]Nice.
[85:46.53]I can already upgrade this weapon.
[85:49.47]Happy days.
[86:05.46]Hoping I can hit him out of the air.
[86:08.29]Mmm, fuck it.
[86:09.01]We're just going to keep going.
[86:10.25]Let's go to two.
[86:23.53]These aren't rhinos, but... We're just going to run by them and go to... No, we're going to go to... Yeah, then we'll go to seven and wrap down to...
[86:36.77]Maybe not.
[86:37.15]What are we doing here?
[86:39.51]Oh, hi.
[86:41.41]You wanna go?
[86:41.85]Should I test out my weapon on a little boss like you?
[86:46.33]See how well I can do any of these combos?
[86:49.91]Let me try.
[87:02.31]Ooh, I like that slash.
[87:08.62]It is going to be harder to hit the little guys though, just because it's so much slower to swing.
[87:15.84]XXAX is like the standard combo, it seems.
[87:29.17]Come on.
[87:37.40]Now I got the meter, right?
[87:38.86]And then that's when I start slashing with this.
[87:44.42]Oh, damn.
[87:45.00]Fucking this weapon is so much better.
[87:46.58]Are you shitting me?
[87:48.12]What a cool weapon.
[87:49.78]What a fucking awesome weapon.
[87:51.88]Why would I ever use that other thing?
[87:53.44]And look, it's glowing now.
[87:57.14]He's already running.
[87:58.96]He is already scared.
[88:00.96]Scared the shit out of him already.
[88:25.39]Man, I get stabbed.
[88:28.44]Out of meter.
[88:56.15]I don't even care that I'm taking hits.
[88:57.41]This is, like, fucking great.
[89:00.55]He's already... Guys.
[89:03.03]Why on Earth was I using the other weapon?
[89:08.15]He's gone.
[89:08.77]But, you know, it's okay.
[89:10.01]Like, that... This thing is fucking great.
[89:12.51]I learned how to use this moveset.
[89:14.05]Bang.
[89:19.57]Oh, jeez.
[89:19.97]I didn't even realize this.
[89:21.13]I, uh...
[89:23.57]I haven't said anything.
[89:24.17]I haven't like read subs in like fucking 25 minutes.
[89:26.49]Where'd he go?
[89:34.46]Uh, give me a minute once I... I'm just gonna track him down.
[89:45.31]The sword and shield is very noob friendly.
[89:46.69]I guess I could see that, but...
[89:51.53]Alright, so with one upgrade on this weapon.
[89:55.83]Wait, what?
[89:59.34]A great jaggy was dying.
[90:02.56]Is that the one right there?
[90:03.86]Or is that a different one?
[90:07.31]I don't know.
[90:22.96]I don't think this is the same one, but... I'm gonna whetstone it up.
[90:38.58]Ooh, okay.
[90:40.00]I have to put it away to do... Oh, that's... Oh, that's not cool.
[90:47.08]Hmm.
[90:48.91]Ah, he's already running.
[90:49.69]No!
[90:54.41]His face is all fucked up.
[91:13.51]There he is.
[91:14.05]Hi there.
[91:17.41]Sorry about this.
[91:35.52]Ayyup!
[91:39.60]Out of meter.
[91:40.32]It's okay.
[91:42.82]He's gonna be dead soon anyways.
[91:50.49]This way, this way, this way.
[91:51.75]Stop moving around!
[91:52.51]Stop!
[91:54.49]He's just running in a circle.
[92:05.73]He's dead!
[92:10.92]That was so much... okay.
[92:14.40]That was so much more fun and so much better than using the sword and shield for me at least.
[92:18.92]Alright, can you guys fuck off?
[92:26.09]Please fucking get out of here!
[92:28.51]Get the fuck out of here!
[92:37.37]That was so much faster.
[92:38.23]That was like... That was at least two to three hundred times faster.
[92:48.97]Fuck the tranq bomb.
[92:54.95]And that's it.
[92:56.31]I still need rhinos.
[92:57.05]Do I have my cool drink?
[93:01.99]Yeah, I do.
[93:14.93]See these weird dolphin things.
[93:23.04]Have I expelled all the rhino?
[93:31.34]After that, right there, this is... I'm so much more happy with this game now.
[93:43.64]Sword and shield on... There we go.
[93:47.88]This is where it's at for me.
[93:50.82]I'll take this any day of the week.
[94:02.42]Did I run out of time?
[94:08.75]No.
[94:09.25]NO!
[94:17.06]Fucking tuna bait.
[94:18.46]I don't even know what to do now.
[94:20.32]I'm so dumb.
[94:31.68]Let's replace the ration.
[94:33.06]Replace it.
[94:43.05]Almost deleted tail.
[94:43.93]I would have died.
[94:52.85]Did I miss the timer?
[95:08.90]Well, I have enough to upgrade it.
[95:09.88]I just need to... 3 out of 6, okay.
[95:26.24]Three, four, five, six.
[95:27.34]And then we can just get out of here.
[95:40.96]It has three glows.
[95:42.00]White, yellow, red.
[95:42.91]It's time you finish a spirit combo with full gauge.
[95:45.27]You do more damage.
[95:47.61]How do you turn off the gauge?
[95:48.83]Is there a way for me to disable it so I can charge it up more?
[95:59.53]That guy took one hit.
[96:06.18]I wish there was like two jabs in a row.
[96:10.95]That'd be cool.
[96:25.80]Where the hell did this bug come from?
[96:28.54]Get out of here!
[96:30.24]Alright, seriously.
[96:32.42]Get the fuck away from me.
[96:35.00]Get the fuck out of here.
[96:36.04]I can't loot this for you.
[96:52.09]Only use the R attack when the gauge is full.
[96:53.69]Okay.
[96:54.93]That works.
[96:59.93]You want to dodge to the left, dude.
[97:15.43]Crouching while carving?
[97:17.63]Is it D to crouch?
[97:31.28]Alright.
[97:33.20]Shell.
[97:34.20]Meat.
[97:34.96]Shell.
[97:35.30]Monster going S. Monster going S. S. S. Alright, let's go upgrade this thing.
[97:42.92]What's this?
[97:46.17]Screamer.
[97:48.15]Screamer.
[97:48.67]Okay.
[97:49.67]Free hunt bonus.
[97:59.48]It's lag.
[97:59.99]We're lagging a bit.
[98:00.89]Don't tell me that my internet's fucked up.
[98:09.79]Stream is skipping sometimes.
[98:15.16]Really.
[98:15.40]Oh, it was a subquest.
[98:23.98]That's cool.
[98:28.23]Cool.
[98:39.04]Just the video, the audio is fine.
[98:40.42]I wonder if that's an internet thing.
[98:41.56]I'm not sure why that would be happening.
[98:56.25]I know I just put everything in here, but I want to take a second to make sure I get everything right.
[99:06.19]Let's sort.
[99:08.41]No, manage.
[99:12.85]Alright, what do we got here?
[99:20.05]Monster bone S in a whetstone.
[99:23.52]Does what?
[99:26.62]Boomerang.
[99:28.66]Alright.
[99:31.06]I'm gonna have to do a thing where I start to put the different monster bones and stuff in a different box.
[99:41.15]So let's do this again.
[99:41.77]Let's upgrade this again, right?
[99:43.69]I should have enough to do it.
[99:49.34]Yeah.
[99:50.48]Lupine Kitana.
[99:53.84]I have the necessary materials.
[99:59.84]This is worth doing, right?
[100:02.84]Because this will be the second time it's upgraded.
[100:14.16]There's a combo list that lets you combine items easier?
[100:16.00]Okay.
[100:16.62]I'll check that out.
[100:21.59]Yeah.
[100:23.69]Loopy.
[100:26.15]That's going to be doing a lot more damage, too.
[100:27.87]That's worth it.
[100:30.05]Let's do it.
[100:32.69]Boink.
[100:35.89]Now what happens if I do it again?
[100:38.55]Cerberus Katana.
[100:45.83]Cerberus Katana.
[100:47.89]Five.
[100:48.79]Monster Bone M again.
[100:49.99]And Baroth Shell.
[100:55.10]Looks the same.
[101:04.53]So, remember you guys talked about Barov?
[101:06.77]I kind of have to fight that thing, don't I?
[101:16.89]No, no, not Barov.
[101:22.83]Looks a little different around here.
[101:23.89]Yeah, it does.
[101:26.32]That weapon is a waste of time if it doesn't get green sharpness.
[101:31.46]I don't know.
[101:34.27]I mean, I can make this one eventually.
[101:36.39]I just need more Ludrith.
[101:41.67]Is it worth me going to try to just find Ludrith again?
[101:44.93]I mean, I'll probably kill him much faster with this thing.
[101:52.54]And then this will have green sharpness, and that'll be upgradable.
[102:00.72]Alright, what about the armor I have right now?
[102:06.73]Armor sphere.
[102:07.51]I don't have any.
[102:09.03]I have these, though.
[102:10.53]Uh, it's just worth doing these, right?
[102:12.13]Whatever, let's do it.
[102:28.78]If that wasn't worth it, then, I mean, whatever.
[102:31.40]Do it again.
[102:47.29]Alright.
[102:48.71]I'm ready to go.
[102:49.27]Well, not go, but, you know.
[102:57.89]What do you have?
[103:06.13]No, whatever.
[103:06.67]That's fine.
[103:07.77]That's fine.
[103:15.05]Now I need...
[103:18.63]Let's go back to my inventory.
[103:19.65]I need my wet stones that I put in here earlier.
[103:36.09]Wherever those are.
[103:41.26]Wet stones there.
[103:48.21]And... I feel like I never do this shit.
[103:55.18]I never use the barbecue spit, ever.
[104:00.28]Is everything worth taking at this point if I never use it?
[104:03.41]I just eat the rations?
[104:11.41]Uh, we gotta do more mushroom hunting.
[104:19.22]Yeah, I need six mushrooms.
[104:21.54]Do I have any more herbs?
[104:26.82]No one uses the barbecue.
[104:34.93]Yeah, I need... more shit.
[104:38.65]Okay.
[104:39.01]I need herbs and blue mushrooms.
[104:41.53]Welcome to the herbs and blue mushrooms stream.
[104:48.76]Didn't I do this yesterday before I turned the stream off?
[104:50.80]I think I did.
[104:55.50]I'm fairly certain I did this yesterday.
[105:04.63]There you go.
[105:07.51]Holy shit.
[105:08.15]Okay, there's a lot.
[105:12.47]Well, there we go.
[105:13.01]Let's do that same thing again.
[105:22.59]How many cycles should I do?
[105:23.63]Five cycles?
[105:24.85]Fuck it.
[105:25.98]Good.
[105:26.54]Do it.
[105:35.46]Do multiplayer?
[105:36.15]I'm going to.
[105:36.85]I'm going to do multiplayer a little bit later today.
[105:42.85]I'll end the stream with multiplayer later.
[105:59.33]Potion.
[105:59.77]Combine.
[106:07.37]Make a potion.
[106:07.89]I need honey.
[106:18.90]Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.
[106:36.00]damn it now hold on a second is there because I'm not doing it in the item box am I losing out on that or something am I losing out on that like extra five percent or is it just if it's in my item box does it not matter
[107:04.17]You have to combine from the box.
[107:05.51]Oh, well, fuck.
[107:06.19]Okay, whatever.
[107:08.52]Oops.
[107:10.82]Well, then, in that case, that's kind of annoying.
[107:16.70]I wish I could just do it from my inventory.
[107:18.58]I'm in the same room.
[107:19.58]Like, why does it matter?
[107:23.27]Do I not have any more honey in the box?
[107:30.21]Fucking garbage.
[107:35.93]I don't think I have any more honey, huh?
[107:41.38]Oh, fuck it.
[107:41.82]Whatever.
[107:42.08]Let's just go.
[107:46.92]Reset.
[107:48.71]Reset the whole stream.
[107:55.97]I can make more potions, though.
[107:57.53]I'll do that.
[108:01.34]Just make them just to make them.
[108:13.10]Into the trash can.
[108:22.08]I need the herbs in there.
[108:33.08]100%.
[108:38.27]They can stay in there for now.
[108:39.25]I have 10 mega potions.
[108:40.47]I'll be okay.
[108:45.68]Start a new file.
[108:48.82]What do you want, lady?
[108:55.77]This is the whole dispatch thing.
[108:59.97]I mean, there's... I don't even know what the hell this shit is for.
[109:04.29]Like I said, this is like Clash of Clans.
[109:07.56]Or something, right?
[109:23.30]Let's see.
[109:23.60]I can hold the button down too.
[109:27.07]Okay.
[109:33.75]I always have a bunch of potions.
[109:34.77]Honey is the bottleneck.
[109:39.32]What else can we do here?
[109:42.84]What did I need to upgrade this weapon again?
[109:45.80]Out of curiosity.
[109:47.84]And where do I get it?
[109:50.57]Dispatches just free shit?
[109:51.67]Okay.
[109:53.71]Upgrade weapon.
[109:54.39]Tana.
[109:57.83]More rhinos.
[109:59.99]And I gotta kill.
[110:00.79]I gotta fight the Baroth.
[110:05.19]Well, let's just go get our ass kicked by the Baroth and figure out what he is and how he works and shit.
[110:11.19]Whetstone.
[110:11.77]Nine.
[110:12.25]That's fine.
[110:13.85]Mega Potion.
[110:14.39]Eight.
[110:15.69]Garbage.
[110:16.57]Just give her to this shit.
[110:21.01]Yeah.
[110:21.29]Whetstone.
[110:21.75]Mega Potion.
[110:23.97]Let's just give it a try.
[110:24.81]I'll probably lose, but it's okay.
[110:29.42]Let's go fight him.
[110:32.06]Let's go fight the guy that I'm absolutely not ready for.
[110:41.38]What is it called?
[110:43.90]Hunt a bear off.
[110:44.68]Leading the charge.
[110:51.48]Hunt a bear off.
[110:54.00]Sandy plains.
[110:55.02]Weak weapons bounce off its tough hide.
[110:57.20]Let's fucking do it.
[111:05.75]Losing is learning.
[111:07.03]That's true.
[111:07.73]I already ate.
[111:09.33]Don't worry.
[111:09.63]I should probably get some cooler drinks, though.
[111:15.17]These are so expensive.
[111:22.82]Let's buy one.
[111:31.97]Let's fight the Baroth.
[111:34.39]Wait, no, we're not gonna fight the Baroth.
[111:37.84]I never fold, thank you for the 11 months.
[111:40.22]Extron 1250, thanks for the sub.
[111:42.86]88 Fingers, thank you for the 9 months, dude.
[111:47.14]Ian Animator, thank you for the 9 months.
[111:49.27]They do a happy clown face.
[111:52.21]Thank you, our newest subscriber, for our newest subscriber.
[111:55.70]Thank you.
[111:58.94]Elvin, thanks for three months.
[112:00.78]Shingkai, for a new sub.
[112:02.76]Spencer, for two months.
[112:05.14]Haterius, for seven months.
[112:06.38]Water levels in video games, nobody asked for them.
[112:10.05]Yeah, I'm not a fan either.
[112:12.57]I thank you to BlackDemo for four months.
[112:14.91]HugeFatRat, handshoes, no rewinds.
[112:19.15]BelieveBlood, Zanpop, CaptainDark.
[112:22.79]Ant-Man 74.
[112:24.53]Better Mix Master for 11 months.
[112:27.43]Wish there was a Monster Hunter-like clone on PC.
[112:29.61]I can't get over the console controls.
[112:33.89]It takes a little getting used to, for sure.
[112:36.07]But thanks a lot, guys.
[112:37.15]And, uh, Ahon, thanks for the three months.
[112:38.77]Still need that coffee, son.
[112:39.83]I need to get a coffee right now.
[112:42.73]Oh, shit.
[112:43.19]I missed bits, too.
[112:44.37]Fuck.
[112:44.77]What a dummy.
[112:45.89]Thank you, Sam.
[112:47.53]I won't be able to donate as many bits for now, so here you go.
[112:49.87]Well, thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[112:51.06]Don't worry about it.
[112:53.29]Baroth with a yellow sharpie.
[112:57.27]Baroth without green sharpness is suicide.
[113:00.34]Should I not do this?
[113:01.18]Is this like just a waste of time?
[113:07.51]Our newest subscriber also gave $10.
[113:09.97]What's the deal with bits?
[113:10.95]Is it like some kind of currency thing?
[113:12.75]Yeah, it is.
[113:13.49]It is some kind of currency thing.
[113:16.70]Thank you.
[113:16.98]Copyright TM for the $5.
[113:19.34]With the katana, once you perform the combo by pressing R as your meter is full, your weapon will do a sort of a level up and get a huge buff to attack, which lasts a long time.
[113:27.08]Okay, cool.
[113:30.60]Thanks, dude.
[113:32.09]It was the aliens.
[113:32.77]Thank you for the $6.
[113:34.37]It's a currency thing.
[113:36.53]And Gummy Monk, thanks for the 400 bits as well.
[113:38.63]For that, seriously though, try a new weapon.
[113:41.19]Yeah, I grabbed a new one.
[113:45.19]And also Crocomire gave 5 bucks as well.
[113:49.45]Thanks a lot, guys.
[113:50.63]Sorry it took me like 45 minutes to get to them.
[113:53.27]Because I suck.
[113:58.13]Okay, let... You know, I have only died like once in this game.
[114:02.05]Let's just go fucking lose.
[114:03.29]I'm curious.
[114:06.55]I don't want to see you 20 minutes in complaining that you are bouncing attacks.
[114:14.04]Alright, hold on.
[114:14.92]Maybe we could... I don't have a green sharpie, so maybe it's not a good idea.
[114:19.96]Maybe I'll go kill Ludrith again.
[114:28.39]No, but didn't it just cost money?
[114:29.79]I think it just costed money for me to come here.
[114:37.17]Y'all get deluged with weapon.
[114:38.13]Alright, okay.
[114:39.21]Here's what we're gonna do.
[114:40.07]Alright, alright, alright.
[114:45.61]Well, I wanna go see what he looks like.
[114:48.37]Yeah, just for fun.
[114:49.57]I wanna see what he looks like.
[114:58.30]Let's see how cool he looks.
[115:01.82]Already here, might as well take a look.
[115:08.53]I need to kill these things anyways, so not a big deal.
[115:26.99]I need more M bone shards.
[115:30.79]So this is not a completely wasted trip.
[115:32.41]Don't worry.
[115:40.84]Let me try that running attack.
[115:42.36]What is it?
[115:46.82]You can combo that too.
[115:47.66]I didn't even know.
[115:51.30]If you abandon, you'll lose all your carbs.
[115:53.12]Will I really?
[115:53.98]You won't keep the... Oh, fuck.
[115:57.40]What if I die?
[115:59.64]But also, what happens when you die?
[116:01.04]If he kills me, what's the death penalty in this game?
[116:13.46]Anything?
[116:14.10]Do you just have to restart?
[116:14.86]Do you lose money?
[116:15.48]Like, what's the actual consequence for dying?
[116:24.59]If I die three times, I keep my stuff.
[116:28.01]You just die.
[116:33.77]Less reward money.
[116:34.47]So there's not, like, just wasted time.
[116:37.51]Yeah, that's a pretty big deal.
[116:39.31]And here we go.
[116:39.73]Do you want to see what he looks like?
[116:47.15]He's kind of derpy looking.
[116:51.81]Chat will make fun of you now.
[116:52.93]I'll give him.
[116:57.71]I just want to see what he does.
[117:01.91]Let's play.
[117:02.94]Come on, Barrow.
[117:19.65]Ooh, he does a roar.
[117:31.26]So far, so far not so bad.
[117:32.88]Should I even use a paintball?
[117:35.00]I'm not going to.
[117:35.58]Oh shit, I thought he was done with that one.
[117:53.49]Come here.
[117:54.01]Z-target.
[117:58.62]What's with this bouncing bullshit, huh?
[118:02.64]Why did he turn me into a marshmallow?
[118:10.90]What's going on?
[118:11.86]You flex when you get out of that ship?
[118:13.82]Well, that's annoying.
[118:26.09]I think I'm okay so far.
[118:32.98]Oof!
[118:55.12]Damn it.
[118:59.10]We got a charge here, boys and girls.
[119:06.24]What do you say we activate the VAT system?
[119:31.39]I'm just gonna do this now.
[119:33.82]While I have a second.
[119:38.72]And I am gonna paintball him.
[119:39.86]Just fuck this guy.
[119:40.90]I'm gonna beat him.
[119:48.67]Got it.
[119:48.89]Okay.
[119:49.09]We're good.
[119:52.73]Yeah, fuck it, guys.
[119:54.93]Let's kill him.
[120:04.20]I didn't do the ending?
[120:05.00]Oh shit, oh well.
[120:13.18]These little bugs are annoying, but I can't be bothered at the moment.
[120:22.50]Woah!
[120:29.11]Oh, roar, roar.
[120:36.47]Hitting him in the face bounces.
[120:43.89]Duly noted.
[120:50.45]Whoops, I didn't want to do that.
[120:51.45]That was a mistake.
[121:01.04]Stuck in his butt.
[121:15.21]Here comes the charge.
[121:19.93]I gotta build that meter up.
[121:24.76]Shit, I got caught there.
[121:28.58]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[121:38.07]Yeah.
[121:44.88]There he goes.
[121:48.04]But where did he go?
[121:53.71]Hello?
[121:54.05]Oh, okay.
[122:01.31]Thank you, lowly imposter.
[122:02.64]And Sam is the worst for three months.
[122:04.04]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[122:15.59]What the fuck was that?
[122:17.15]That was the clumsiest fucking thing I think I've ever seen.
[122:25.71]Alright, I gotta concentrate again.
[122:48.43]Ooh, somebody just took a fucking spill.
[122:55.61]Come on, I gotta get that charge.
[122:58.52]Let's do it!
[123:04.26]Got it.
[123:07.84]What happened?
[123:22.08]Come on, I gotta... No!
[123:23.46]He stopped at shit.
[123:33.61]Cut the tail?
[123:34.23]I'm trying.
[123:38.43]He's gonna roar.
[123:57.86]Get that tail.
[124:00.54]Alright, I'm gonna actively try to get the tail.
[124:02.96]But hold on, let me kill the fucking annoying scorpion.
[124:09.37]Damn it.
[124:15.41]What?
[124:16.35]Come on!
[124:18.53]Alright, that's the best place to do it.
[124:19.79]That's the spot you gotta do it.
[124:23.75]When he starts shaking like that, you can just have free reign to hit his tail.
[124:26.67]I didn't know that was going to happen.
[124:40.31]You can I-frame the roar.
[124:41.32]I feel like that's going to be very hard for me to do that.
[124:47.92]Shit.
[124:49.04]Shit.
[124:49.60]Fuck.
[124:53.10]Stay away from his face.
[125:03.97]Damn it.
[125:04.39]He still got me.
[125:05.08]Fucker.
[125:07.58]The mic?
[125:08.08]My mic desynced?
[125:09.78]How the hell did that happen?
[125:36.24]Just waiting for an opportunity.
[125:39.84]That Mike's ahead of the video.
[125:41.10]What the fuck?
[125:41.93]That's weird.
[125:51.31]Let me see if I can fix that.
[126:01.84]Was that happening yesterday?
[126:08.33]Was it desynced yesterday, too?
[126:10.39]Shouldn't be.
[126:10.81]I might have to, like, change that and restart the stream.
[126:25.37]Oh.
[126:26.97]No.
[126:27.45]You fucker.
[126:30.69]I'm never pressing that fucking button.
[126:34.97]I swear to God, I'm never pressing Y. Ever.
[126:37.95]Actually, I kind of have to.
[126:57.08]Let's go.
[127:09.92]Give me that tail.
[127:11.30]Give me that tail.
[127:11.93]Give me that tail!
[127:12.81]Give me your tail!
[127:41.04]Got it!
[127:41.72]No I didn't.
[128:11.16]I gotta take a ration.
[128:23.39]I'm a half second ahead of you guys.
[128:24.65]Let's see if I can fix that after this boss fight.
[128:30.41]Shit, he turned.
[129:05.21]I hate that so much.
[129:07.15]I fucking hate that.
[129:11.77]That was such fucking trash.
[129:13.97]Oh, I hate that fucking dumb flex.
[129:18.90]Doesn't even need to be there, man.
[129:33.67]Ooh, he's on the ground.
[129:51.96]Got it!
[129:52.92]Got the tail!
[129:54.78]Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
[130:01.78]Got it.
[130:02.02]That's it, right?
[130:14.33]Shit.
[130:17.59]Where did he go?
[130:18.05]I don't have any more paintballs.
[130:21.72]Chad, help me out here.
[130:22.38]Where the fuck did he go?
[130:28.09]Nine?
[130:36.41]Fuck me.
[130:37.91]Where did he go?
[130:41.45]Shiny.
[130:41.91]Shiny.
[130:42.15]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[130:47.94]Shiny what?
[130:49.56]Shiny what?
[130:50.00]Shiny!
[130:51.23]Shiny.
[130:59.96]I got it.
[131:00.30]Everyone calm down.
[131:01.14]I got it.
[131:01.48]Don't worry.
[131:10.18]I got it.
[131:23.13]Where the fuck did he go?
[131:27.61]He's like healing right now.
[131:29.25]Where the fuck is he?
[131:50.16]Not in here.
[132:00.18]He went that away.
[132:10.04]Come on, go, go, go, go, go.
[132:15.49]Not in three.
[132:16.11]It's gotta be in four, come on.
[132:20.89]Area four?
[132:24.89]How would I have known that?
[132:28.01]You want me to scream out loud again?
[132:29.27]The whole, I know where this is, you don't, because I've played the game before.
[132:32.28]You want me to scream that again?
[132:33.12]There's nobody here.
[132:37.96]There's nobody here, guys.
[132:42.55]There's no one here.
[132:45.65]Everyone that was screaming at me to go to four, there's nobody here.
[132:55.57]Not even fucking here, guys.
[132:57.43]Ooh, there he is!
[133:05.54]Why did I doubt you, chat?
[133:06.66]How could I have doubted you?
[133:07.62]Let's fuck this guy up.
[133:14.78]It's like his shit.
[133:23.59]We're going for a fucking combo.
[133:33.52]Should've dodged right into that.
[133:52.21]Come on, I need to get you with this.
[133:53.19]Let's do it!
[134:00.01]You know what time it is, guys.
[134:00.95]It's time to activate the VAT system!
[134:08.56]You didn't see that.
[134:09.72]You saw this, though.
[134:16.72]You didn't see that.
[134:34.41]Ooh, don't move.
[134:45.63]Back it up.
[134:46.03]Don't anything stomp.
[134:46.71]I'm getting greedy here.
[134:47.87]Easy.
[134:51.23]He's limping.
[134:51.69]Alright.
[135:06.74]He's going to be down here.
[135:08.39]Do the finisher.
[135:09.27]I tried to.
[135:09.83]It's X and A at the end of the combo, right?
[135:11.65]Or is it you hold L?
[135:12.65]How does it work?
[135:14.67]Keep pressing R until the finisher as you just tap R. There it is.
[135:39.86]He's gone again.
[135:41.42]That was quick.
[135:43.80]That was very quick.
[135:46.32]R, X, R, X. Just spam R. Thought I could dodge through that.
[136:12.52]Shit, I'm gonna bounce.
[136:14.24]Dodge, please!
[136:52.05]And ladies and gentlemen boys and girls this is how you finish a fucking monster He's still alive, but it's okay I did the combo
[137:13.04]No... Really?
[137:23.21]Fuck off.
[137:25.53]That was bullshit.
[137:29.24]He's just in such a fucking dumb spot right now.
[137:31.74]Seriously.
[137:51.83]Not using a mega potion here.
[137:57.18]Haunt him.
[137:59.28]Fuck.
[138:24.60]I hate his movement pattern.
[138:26.22]It's just so annoying.
[138:27.62]Oh, it's annoying.
[138:28.56]It's so annoying.
[138:29.42]I was going to complain.
[138:30.82]It's so annoying.
[138:41.64]He's dead.
[138:42.04]Fuck off.
[138:50.97]You guys thought I was going to lose to this guy.
[138:56.63]Everybody was so concerned.
[138:57.73]Everybody thought I was going to lose.
[139:06.72]I thought I was going to lose.
[139:07.74]Everyone was talking about how hard this guy was going to be.
[139:16.18]Let me see what the audio issue here.
[139:17.66]Hold on.
[139:23.58]So you're saying my voice is happening before anything happens on the screen.
[139:33.41]That was so much more enjoyable than using the sword and shield.
[139:45.34]There's no audio issue.
[139:49.72]Like a second before.
[139:51.04]So like, I'm like, oh my god!
[139:52.72]And then he swings.
[139:55.90]Let's try this.
[140:05.00]Alright.
[140:06.28]You tell me if that helped.
[140:09.98]Must've gone L. Shit, I need more than this.
[140:36.38]Alright, so I just changed something.
[140:37.62]Let me see.
[140:38.00]Ready?
[140:39.40]So I'm going to... I'm moving around on the menu.
[140:43.11]I'm going to do a mic sync test.
[140:44.15]I did this before.
[140:44.81]I don't know why it's off right now.
[140:46.95]Alright, you ready?
[140:50.15]Store items.
[140:50.97]Item box.
[140:51.39]We're in the item box right now.
[140:52.63]You ready?
[140:54.31]Bang.
[140:54.89]Bang.
[140:55.57]Bang.
[140:56.17]Bang.
[140:56.75]Bang.
[140:57.35]Bang.
[140:59.10]Bang.
[140:59.60]Was that when I was moving?
[141:04.92]Was that synced up?
[141:06.41]Cool drink.
[141:07.53]Mega potion.
[141:08.57]Baroth shell.
[141:09.67]Whetstone.
[141:12.86]How we doing?
[141:17.46]Still off?
[141:20.56]It's even worse.
[141:22.40]Wait, what?
[141:24.60]So wait, it got worse.
[141:28.10]What the fuck happened?
[141:38.95]The voice is still early.
[141:47.19]Why the fuck is this happening?
[141:53.72]I'm gonna have to restart the stream.
[141:56.68]Alright, let's... I want you guys to... I won't have to restart the stream if we can do this like this.
[142:01.32]Ready?
[142:05.88]So tell me if it just got way fucking worse.
[142:07.62]You ready?
[142:10.32]We're on Baroth Ridge.
[142:12.86]Up.
[142:13.78]Down.
[142:14.90]Up.
[142:15.90]Down.
[142:18.28]Did it just get way different?
[142:23.30]Or did it change at all?
[142:36.93]Still exactly the same.
[142:37.99]Okay.
[142:39.69]Well...
[142:41.59]Uh, I can easily fix it.
[142:44.62]I have to turn the stream off, though.
[142:49.62]Same.
[142:49.98]Okay.
[142:57.26]It's not that big of a deal.
[142:58.44]Yeah, but I mean, if I'm gonna be streaming for, like, another four hours, I'd like it to not be fucked up.
[143:07.92]I'll be right back.
[143:08.44]I'm going to literally just change one setting and come back.
[143:11.63]So I will be back in like 30 seconds.
[143:12.99]30 seconds.
