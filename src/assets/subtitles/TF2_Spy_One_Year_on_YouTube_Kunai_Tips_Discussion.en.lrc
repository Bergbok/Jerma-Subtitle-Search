[00:09.04]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.95]Jeremiah here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.79]And tonight, I'm going to be playing as the spy with the Conniver's Kunai, the Dead Ringer, and the L'Etranger.
[00:25.21]So, this video is going to talk about a couple of things.
[00:27.61]First of all, this is on defense, on upward.
[00:30.65]We do a very good job of keeping them into their spawns.
[00:33.97]I think they only come out to the halfway point before the first cap, and that's where the game ends.
[00:38.67]I do very well here.
[00:39.95]I think I kill 16 or 17 people or something without dying.
[00:44.14]Which is, that's good for me with Spy, because I've lost my Spy touch in recent years.
[00:49.44]But it is good to come back and do well sometimes.
[00:52.96]But this video is going to touch upon two things, very important things.
[00:56.40]The first one I'm going to get to is one year on YouTube.
[01:00.33]And this happened a few days ago, and I will explain my tardiness in this matter.
[01:05.69]And it's actually a pretty funny story, and not funny now, it wasn't funny a while ago, but I remember sitting in the hospital bed when I was in the hospital on my one year anniversary on YouTube.
[01:18.19]Now, don't worry.
[01:19.44]I'm not making this commentary from beyond the grave.
[01:22.08]I'm at my desk.
[01:23.72]I'm okay.
[01:24.40]I'm here.
[01:25.38]And do not worry about me at all.
[01:28.32]Also, in this video, I do want to get to the kunai.
[01:31.14]I want to talk about the kunai a little bit and some of the tips and strategies that I use, that sort of thing.
[01:35.60]But that's going to happen near the end of the video.
[01:37.91]I want to spend most of the time talking about, of course, one year on YouTube and the insane day that I had on June the 11th.
[01:46.60]So let's back up a little bit to June 10th, the night before my one year anniversary.
[01:51.66]I went to sleep and as I was falling asleep, I told myself, alright, Jeremy, I'm going to make something cool tomorrow.
[01:57.50]I want to talk about something.
[01:58.74]I want to bring up the one year thing because it's really is really important to me.
[02:02.07]And it is really a milestone that I was really looking forward to.
[02:06.81]So I went to bed.
[02:07.61]Alright, what am I going to do for June 11th?
[02:09.21]Cool.
[02:09.97]Wake up June 11th.
[02:11.67]And those of you that have this problem, you have my utmost condolences.
[02:16.05]I feel your pain.
[02:18.57]I have migraine headaches.
[02:20.75]And sometimes I get migraine headaches that completely debilitate me where I can't even move.
[02:25.35]I can't even get out of bed.
[02:26.21]I can't even think and I can't even talk.
[02:28.49]So I woke up June 11th with one of these migraines.
[02:32.76]And it happened to be one of the worst migraines of my entire life.
[02:36.60]Now, if you don't know what a migraine is essentially it's when a bird, a very large bird, claws his way into your eyeball into the center of your head and lays eggs in your brain.
[02:48.60]Now that is not what actually happens but that of course is what it feels like is what's happening.
[02:52.60]So I was in the hospital all of June 11th and I had no computers, no outside world touch.
[02:58.60]I got out of the hospital I think at like 10 o'clock at night, my time, and I went there at like 11 in the morning.
[03:05.34]I had IVs, I had to do cat scans, I had to do like saline drips and stuff.
[03:09.58]They wanted to give me, this is how ridiculous this is, they wanted to keep me in the hospital and they wanted to give me a phosphate drip and it was going to last like 12 hours.
[03:18.73]Me just sitting there with a thing in my arm and they also wanted to do a spinal tap.
[03:23.67]And at that point, you know, you hit a, every man has this point in their life where they say, it's time to go home.
[03:30.54]I'll figure this all out on my own time.
[03:32.18]I'll call the doctor.
[03:33.14]I'll get an appointment.
[03:34.38]I was not going to sit there with all these things out of my arms, sit there for 12 hours and just... I don't know.
[03:39.42]I just had to get the hell out of there.
[03:40.94]And I did.
[03:41.42]I got discharged.
[03:42.72]And I'm okay now.
[03:43.58]I'm fine now.
[03:44.30]And the thing about migraines is...
[03:47.04]They can last a very short amount of time, but it's a very horrible short amount of time.
[03:51.89]So for my one-year video, this is kind of my one-year video, but I didn't really have a chance to make anything.
[03:57.47]Somebody did, and this is just unbelievable to me, guys.
[04:01.98]When I saw this...
[04:03.48]I nearly cried because this was just so awesome, so well done.
[04:08.38]Somebody made me a one year anniversary video and it is very long and it took this person a very long time to make.
[04:16.03]The link will be in the description.
[04:17.43]It's from DJ The D. He's the guy that's doing the Steam Workshop modeling.
[04:21.61]But he spent a lot of time on this.
[04:23.07]He kind of goes through a timeline of almost since when I started on YouTube.
[04:28.08]And it was just very humbling.
[04:30.10]Hats off to you, man.
[04:30.96]Thank you for making that.
[04:32.06]And thank you to everybody, especially for being around here for this entire year.
[04:35.90]You guys all rock.
[04:36.72]You guys are all awesome.
[04:37.95]So go check out that video.
[04:39.07]It's in the description right now.
[04:40.87]Thank you all again.
[04:42.17]And now let's start talking about the kunai.
[04:45.07]Jeez, I didn't give myself any time to talk about the damn thing.
[04:47.51]Alright, well, I'll talk about it.
[04:48.47]Even if it's a black screen, I will continue to talk about it.
[04:50.71]And maybe I'll add a random clip on the end of this as well.
[04:54.56]So the Conniver's Kunai.
[04:57.32]My biggest tip for this knife is only use it with the Dead Ringer.
[05:01.25]You can use it with the default invisibility watch or the Cloak and Dagger, but it is so difficult to do that.
[05:07.51]One stray rocket, one stray bullet, anything, you will die in one second.
[05:13.63]Which can be incredibly frustrating.
[05:15.67]But one really good thing about using the Conniver's Kunai and the default invisibility watch is everybody is going to think you're a Dead Ringer.
[05:23.89]How many times have you shot a spy with either a shotgun or even one little stray rocket, and he dies instantly?
[05:31.06]It's an automatic response to say in your brain, that's a Dead Ringer, I know it, guaranteed.
[05:37.30]And you might not be correct, because this could be a Conniver's Kunai default spy watch, and you really did just kill him.
[05:45.21]So it's good to throw people off that way.
[05:47.33]But other than that, I would say yes, use this with the Dead Ringer, pretty much 8 times out of 10.
[05:52.97]So one other tip that's probably the most important is don't be afraid to take some heat with this knife.
[05:59.98]Especially during a chain stab or especially when you're behind a bunch of people.
[06:04.91]Because think of it like this.
[06:06.37]If you get one backstab on somebody with full health, you are going to get 180 health overhealed.
[06:12.65]So even if there are people behind you shooting at you, you just have to backstab another person in front of you and you'll go right back up to 180.
[06:20.36]That's of course assuming that they have full health.
[06:23.44]But still, it's better to not concern yourself with the people that are behind you rather than the people in front of you.
[06:29.70]Because like I said, you can go on a chain here and just 180, 180, 180.
[06:35.17]And even if you dip down to like 10 health, you just have to stab that one person and you can just keep going on your merry way.
[06:41.17]So do not be concerned with people behind you, especially when you're on a payload map.
[06:46.17]So the last tip I can give you is going to use a diagram and it's going to be on the screen right now.
[06:53.17]Here is this diagram. It's going to show you how to use the Conniver's Kunai.
[06:57.17]Essentially you're going to make a route in a circle around the focal point of the map - whether that's the payload cart or the points.
[07:05.09]So when you make this circle, you're going to have 180 health by killing this guy right up here.
[07:09.80]After he's dead, go around the side and make sort of a semi-circle around the enemy team.
[07:16.01]Once you do that, if you end up taking damage from this guy, do not worry at all.
[07:21.56]The guy at the front of the line, all the way up there, is going to heal you to full health, or at least close to it.
[07:27.56]So you can start the circle all over again.
[07:29.94]This is the Conniver's Kunai circle of life.
[07:33.85]That's a tentative example.
[07:36.07]But this is kind of a general spy strategy as well.
[07:39.01]It's not only for the Conniver's Kunai.
[07:41.22]You can do this with some of the other knives as well, or any of them.
[07:44.22]But just wanted to give my examples of how I use this thing.
[07:47.74]So that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[07:49.48]Thank you so much for watching.
[07:50.78]I really do appreciate it.
[07:52.52]One year on YouTube, guys.
[07:54.11]Thank you all for everything.
[07:55.45]You guys are all the man or the woman, depending on your gender.
[07:58.95]But I will see you guys all soon.
[08:00.75]And let's look forward to 10 more years of YouTube.
[08:04.81]Take care, everybody.
