[00:08.44]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:09.83]Jerma here with recoil.
[00:12.13]I just was spectating.
[00:13.23]I was trying to spectate a guy that knew what he was doing.
[00:15.23]Looks like Artman's gonna go in.
[00:16.33]We're gonna see here.
[00:17.15]Going for the double shotgun shot.
[00:18.23]Gets the shot.
[00:18.81]Gets two shots on him.
[00:20.39]Right there.
[00:20.83]We got Artman gonna be going in for the kill here.
[00:22.23]Gonna see on the top left staircase.
[00:23.43]Gets the pistol out.
[00:24.15]Is he gonna get it in time?
[00:25.51]He's dancing around.
[00:26.63]Going for the knife kills.
[00:27.57]Is he gonna get it in?
[00:32.34]No!
[00:33.66]No, that was so unexpected.
[00:37.67]So I guess now is a good time to do a player profile on Shizzyboy.
[00:41.21]I guess now is time to do a player profile on Clidio.
[00:44.17]Clidio is one of those players you just love to watch, guys.
[00:46.55]He has a lot of things in his arsenal.
[00:48.13]He's one of the best AK-74 players in the world.
[00:51.31]And he also plays the piano, so a good little bit of tidbit of information on the player.
[00:55.12]That I like to see.
[00:56.02]Now I'm going to do a player profile on V2FXXX.
[00:59.50]He is one of the best SMG players in the world.
[01:02.06]As you can probably imagine, having an SMG is a lot better for movement and to be able to get the speed that you need.
[01:07.95]Now we're gonna do a player profile on Cat.
[01:09.55]Now we're gonna do a player profile on Shizzy Boy.
[01:12.01]Shizzy Boy is another one of those characters you'll love to see.
[01:14.31]Now we're gonna do a player profile on Zeyoshio.
[01:20.97]Just like that, we get a two-piece.
[01:22.97]Just like... Oh.
[01:29.45]Yeah, stuff him.
[01:30.41]Stuff him.
[01:31.63]Me and my teammates.
[01:32.91]Me and my teammates recoiling all over the place.
[01:35.65]Look at that.
[01:37.67]I'll teach you how to recoil, guys.
[01:38.92]What you want to do first, you want to turn a corner with a fucking grenade in your hand, and you just want to throw it into their spawn.
[01:45.94]I don't even know if that's their spawn.
[01:47.12]I got a couple hits.
[01:48.54]Tango down.
[01:49.73]Charlie down.
[01:50.97]And... guy in a window.
[01:53.97]Down?
[01:55.39]No.
[01:57.19]I gotta get... I gotta string something.
[01:59.83]What the hell is that guy?
[02:01.92]What the hell?
[02:02.46]This guy got, like, face paint on?
[02:05.68]I wanna, like, see his broken-ass neck.
[02:08.36]Yeah, he's got, like, face paint on.
[02:09.50]This guy looks like a WWF wrestler.
[02:13.46]I wanna be, like, a WCW-NWO wrestler.
[02:19.43]There it is, killing machine.
[02:21.57]Oh!
[02:23.11]That's two!
[02:25.53]Fucking WCW guy killed me.
[02:32.57]The fuck happened to you?
[02:38.33]I definitely want to be a WCW.
[02:39.87]Okay, we got this WCW guy.
[02:42.53]This guy is just kind of crazy looking.
[02:44.33]He's kind of creepy.
[02:45.31]And then we got Tattoo Guy.
[02:46.47]Why is... Why is Tattoo Guy the guy with the face paint?
[02:50.76]And then... This should be Tattoo Guy.
[02:55.94]Something I've noticed in every video game that has this gun.
[03:00.01]The Drognov always sucks.
[03:03.96]Has there ever been a game made where the draugnov wasn't a fucking piece of shit?
[03:10.50]Has that ever happened?
[03:11.74]I just got three kills with it in a row, so let's just pretend like I didn't say that.
[03:20.42]Ooh.
[03:22.14]Ooh.
[03:23.94]Ooh!
[03:27.04]Somebody's... Somebody learned how to play!
[03:38.07]Be a part of wall!
[03:40.31]I'm gonna teach you guys how to make pancakes, alright?
[03:44.10]It's gonna be pretty easy.
[03:45.76]There's the first ingredient, that's two eggs.
[03:47.52]Around this corner, we got some butter.
[03:51.80]And then, of course, you cannot forget... Fucking God!
[03:56.45]This is the secret recipe for pancakes.
[03:58.77]Two eggs.
[04:01.25]Then you gotta also put in the butter.
[04:03.65]But I can't find the butter.
[04:04.73]The butter ran down here.
[04:06.49]There's the butter.
[04:08.19]I missed the bowl with the butter.
[04:09.93]Fucking goddammit!
[04:11.65]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[04:12.85]Jerma here.
[04:14.05]Welcome to Cooking with Jerma.
[04:15.44]This is a new series I'm doing, where I show you how to make a very healthy, very nice breakfast.
[04:20.48]And what you want is you want a bowl.
[04:21.72]Bowl large enough to put a bunch of stuff in, obviously, because we're gonna give you my secret recipe for pancakes.
[04:26.82]So what you want to do is, of course, you want to put in, you know, where we got here, two eggs.
[04:32.44]Little bit of butter.
[04:32.98]Hold on.
[04:33.92]The butter ran away.
[04:34.62]Hold on.
[04:36.24]Ah, the butter fell on the floor.
[04:38.06]I gotta pick up the butter.
[04:39.38]There's the butter.
[04:39.92]There's the butter.
[04:43.23]Butter's in the bowl now.
[04:44.15]Then, of course, you gotta add the flour.
[04:46.25]Flour is shooting at me.
[04:48.55]Flour's shooting at me.
[04:49.69]It's okay.
[04:50.13]It's okay.
[04:52.94]Flour killed me.
[04:55.15]Welcome to Cooking with Tremor, guys.
[04:57.51]In this episode, I'm gonna teach you how to make pancakes.
[05:00.90]Those of you that think you know how to make pancakes, you got it all wrong.
[05:03.82]You see, first you gotta get a bowl.
[05:06.16]Then once you get that bowl, you throw in two eggs.
[05:09.45]Once the eggs are in there, you put in the flour.
[05:12.45]Once the flour's in there, you roll your sleeves up, get your hands a little bit dirty, and you add a little bit more butter.
[05:18.77]Fucking god damn it!
[05:22.42]Do you understand how hard you're trying to make one of the worst jokes I have ever heard?
[05:28.97]I'm getting behind them.
[05:29.79]I'm getting in their spawn.
[05:31.45]And it's gonna be a big fucking surprise when I get in there.
[05:37.46]Speaking of big su-
[05:43.06]What?
[05:44.26]What is this?
[05:46.22]What is this fucking Gumby?
[05:48.18]What is this?
[05:51.27]What is that like fucking Stretch Armstrong in like a fucking taffy factory?
[05:58.37]And we're coming out of the wire here, guys.
[05:59.91]This is the final moment in the 2016 Recoil Tournament.
[06:04.19]Welcome.
[06:04.54]I'm very glad to do it with you.
[06:06.80]We're very glad to cast it with you.
[06:08.66]Very glad to do it with you.
[06:13.45]V2 coming around with a shot rifle.
[06:14.85]Got a couple of shots on him.
[06:15.77]Shizzyboy is looking bad here.
[06:17.79]He's gonna jump on the top and he gets the kill with his super duper scoper boper.
[06:22.77]And he gets a good shot.
[06:25.85]And he turns around.
[06:27.09]We got the cash drag.
[06:27.83]We're getting wrapped around by two people.
[06:29.09]And oh my god!
[06:29.99]Did you see that fucking backflip?
