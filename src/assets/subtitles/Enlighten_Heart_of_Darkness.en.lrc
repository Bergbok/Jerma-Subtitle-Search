[00:06.93]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:09.87]Jerma here with another episode of Enlighten, the series, of course, where I go back in time, look at a title that was overlooked by a lot of people.
[00:18.63]Well, maybe not so much overlooked by people, but a title that fell through the cracks and nobody really talks about anymore.
[00:25.75]So this time I'm going to talk about Heart of Darkness.
[00:28.54]No, not the book.
[00:30.10]This has nothing to do with the book.
[00:31.92]It's got the same name, though.
[00:33.62]It's kind of funny.
[00:34.80]So the guy responsible for this game, his name is Eric Shahi.
[00:38.46]And he's sort of the grandfather of cinematic storytelling in video games.
[00:43.14]Eric Shahi is the guy that made Another World.
[00:45.71]And if you type Another World into Google, you're going to find a million different articles on this guy.
[00:51.17]And if it wasn't for guys like Eric Shahi,
[00:53.85]We would probably be stuck still in the press A to jump, press B to shoot, kill the boss at the end of the game type gameplay.
[01:02.11]But let's start talking about Heart of Darkness.
[01:05.05]Gonna do this in review style, just like in the last video.
[01:08.45]So what do you say we go back in time?
[01:22.10]Space!
[01:23.67]The infinite journey.
[01:26.13]These are the stories of... No, that's not how this works.
[01:28.47]This is Heart of Darkness, a game so full of imagination that it couldn't even handle itself.
[01:35.98]Releasing in 1998 under the now defunct Interplay, Heart of Darkness is the definition of development and publishing struggles.
[01:44.58]The game saw many, many different delays.
[01:46.96]Mostly, it was to create the game's many cutscenes and pre-rendered backgrounds.
[01:51.75]Not to mention the bidding war that went between a bunch of different companies on who was actually going to distribute this game.
[01:58.41]For all these shortcomings though, the game did do quite well.
[02:01.56]Over a million copies sold.
[02:03.86]Now that's quite a success for any game company standards.
[02:06.74]So what happened to this game?
[02:08.60]How come you don't really hear about it?
[02:09.84]How come nobody cares about it?
[02:11.49]It's because of Ocarina of Time.
[02:13.83]Ocarina of Time, Banjo-Kazooie, and Resident Evil 2 all released in this same year, and Banjo-Kazooie actually released one day before Heart of Darkness.
[02:25.56]So it's a big uphill battle, especially Ocarina of Time.
[02:29.26]Ocarina of Time is considered one of the best games ever created.
[02:33.17]So when your game is going up against those types of games, you're in a little bit of trouble.
[02:42.21]Heart of Darkness is about a young boy named Andy, a young middle schooler with an authority problem.
[02:47.81]After getting in trouble at school, in what seems to be a regular occurrence, Andy meets up with his faithful companion Whiskey.
[02:54.59]After a strange eclipse sucks away his dog companion, Andy rushes home to start his journey of rescue.
[03:00.65]The story is pretty cut and dry, but it can be cute in the right places.
[03:11.49]The cutscenes in the game are very, very interesting.
[03:14.29]They always start and always end in gameplay.
[03:18.00]It can be something as simple as talking to your dog, or dropping you in front of a 50-foot monster that's about to eat off your face.
[03:24.94]And this is something that Heart of Darkness does very, very well.
[03:28.18]They give you a sense of urgency.
[03:30.14]You have to pay attention to the cutscenes, because if you don't, if you get up and go get a soda somewhere, you're gonna sit back down and be dead over and over again.
[03:37.36]And these cutscenes are really, really streamlined.
[03:39.84]Sometimes you don't even know they're happening.
[03:41.76]It's a fantastic mechanic that really should be the norm for the industry.
[03:46.05]More people need to take a page out of the Half-Life book and have cutscenes and have cinematics be part of the experience rather than just be something you load and watch.
[03:57.17]So gameplay-wise, Heart of Darkness plays just like the other Eric Chahi games.
[04:01.80]In most situations you are going to be jumping on platforms, climbing on walls, or solving strange puzzles.
[04:07.70]Difficulty-wise, this game is on an incredibly difficult scale.
[04:12.01]The controls are very difficult to get used to, and at points the game is just unfair.
[04:18.96]Your only real means of defense is a wonky laser beam gun and a magical green goo attack.
[04:24.99]So what I'm trying to say is, you are going to die in this game.
[04:29.35]Over, and over, and over, and over again.
[04:34.03]So prime your wall to be ready for a controller to go through it.
[04:38.05]And it can be also said that Heart of Darkness has some very, very graphic death animations.
[04:43.98]You get ripped apart, you get squished, you get crushed.
[04:47.88]There are a lot of terrible ways to die in this game.
[04:54.43]The game is also very, very short, spanning two discs.
[04:58.29]It only takes about two and a half hours to beat the entire game.
[05:01.79]Most of the room is taken up by, of course, the cutscenes, 30 minutes of them on both discs.
[05:06.67]But if you can take the stress of the gameplay and you don't mind watching a cutscene every now and then, this game has to be played.
[05:14.06]Eric Chahi has created a fantastic game, and I am so glad that he got back into the industry.
[05:20.42]He created that new game from Dust.
[05:23.02]That is an Eric Chahi game.
[05:24.64]So it's great to see him getting back into it after so long.
[05:27.60]But that's going to wrap up this episode of Enlightened, guys.
[05:30.24]Thank you so much for watching.
[05:31.62]I really do appreciate it.
[05:33.02]And go check out this game if you have a chance.
[05:36.62]So thank you, everybody.
[05:37.86]I will see you all next time.
[05:39.58]Take care, everybody.
