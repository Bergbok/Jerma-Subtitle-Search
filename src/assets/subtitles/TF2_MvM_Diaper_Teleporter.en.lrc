[00:12.85]Oh my god, Star.
[00:14.77]Are you serious?
[00:18.44]Are you serious?
[00:20.88]It's not even two-way.
[00:23.12]You die in the game, you die in real life.
[00:25.06]Where's your teleporter?
[00:26.30]What the fuck?
[00:27.00]Don't take it.
[00:28.12]There isn't one to take.
[00:37.36]I just took the teleporter, but I didn't die.
[00:41.64]I walked out of it, and I was confused, but I didn't step on the banana.
[00:45.73]Good job.
[00:46.75]Watch it, he's gonna put it under you.
[00:49.35]Like a diaper.
[00:50.49]Oh my god.
[00:52.49]Alright.
[00:54.69]Oh my god.
[00:56.99]Where did he put it?
[00:58.01]It'll come when you least expect it.
[00:59.94]Like a diaper.
[01:00.66]Like a diaper.
[01:03.94]Diapers are unexpected in society.
[01:07.75]It's by the tank.
[01:08.83]It's about to go away.
[01:09.51]Oh my god.
[01:12.83]I know, I know.
[01:13.73]Where's it going?
[01:20.49]Back to spawn.
[01:23.04]And he's... He's milked.
[01:25.72]What?
[01:26.46]What?
[01:28.49]Why did I just take it?
[01:29.41]Darn, did you just put the teleporter underneath me?
[01:32.73]What?
[01:33.53]Your teleporter.
[01:34.61]I just went back to... What the hell was that?
[01:36.91]Did I just step on it or something?
[01:38.77]Well, no, my teleporter hasn't moved.
[01:40.37]What?
[01:41.49]It's been up the staircase the entire time.
[01:42.98]What happened?
[01:43.84]Oh, I walked into it and I teleported back to still a... There's a teleport back to spawn canteen you can get.
[01:49.96]Did you get that on accident?
[01:51.64]No, I don't have any canteens.
[01:53.40]Did you walk all the way back to spawn and then forget that you walked there?
[01:57.43]No, I was shooting the fake scout and all of a sudden... Have you just never left spawn?
[02:02.84]Is this an M9 shop on film?
[02:05.06]He's trying to put diaper teleporters everywhere.
[02:09.01]This tank has lived past its expiration date.
[02:13.23]Like a diaper.
[02:24.18]What is that?
[02:24.70]YOU DID- YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!
[02:27.38]What are you, body blocking or something?
[02:30.96]No, yeah... Oh, I know what he did.
[02:34.37]You are such a dick!
[02:36.27]Why are you kidding me?
[02:37.67]You got so distraught.
[02:39.11]You gotta be kidding me!
[02:41.35]Everyone knows that's why you don't use the Brass Beast.
[02:43.83]Oh, so your friend can't, like, bait a sentry buster to kill you?
[02:48.45]Yeah.
[02:49.59]It ain't gonna happen again.
[02:59.93]Oh my fucking god.
[03:01.65]Peace out!
[03:02.47]Fell down the hole, too.
[03:04.65]You seriously, dude?
[03:06.23]This is why I like you, Jerva.
[03:09.56]Because you're the only one that falls for it.
[03:12.08]I'm not even falling for it, I'm trying to play the fucking game!
[03:16.58]Like, I'm trying to play Man vs. Machine.
[03:18.22]You always have to turn around.
[03:19.80]It's like looking for a spy, constantly.
[03:23.06]How do you get, how do you do that?
[03:24.22]How do you get the person to drop down that, like, death pit?
[03:26.78]It's usually very hard.
[03:28.13]Because no one actually walks down it.
[03:31.39]Yeah, they usually gotta be dumb.
[03:32.95]I'm just, I just want to play man versus machine, man.
[03:36.43]That's so much to ask.
[03:37.45]Yeah, that's not allowed.
[03:39.76]I would honestly not expect someone to put a diaper on me.
[03:42.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[03:49.42]See you later, tag.
[03:52.47]See you later.
[03:53.93]I couldn't even see anything.
[03:57.19]Can you get squished with you?
[04:01.55]Oh my god.
[04:02.45]What did you do?
[04:04.01]You can't.
[04:12.86]Yes!
[04:13.34]Oh, no!
[04:16.02]Yes!
[04:17.76]I watched the entire thing.
[04:19.44]I was just waiting to save my sentry.
[04:22.05]That's what you get.
[04:22.93]Why aren't we working together?
[04:24.27]Shut up!
[04:24.83]I don't know why you're trying to put diapers in the pool.
[04:26.97]Uh-huh.
[04:36.16]Oh my god.
[04:36.52]Are you fucking... Is he still doing that shit?
[04:39.34]You still haven't gone over that shit yet?
[04:41.34]I'm looking at my fucking other monitor, hoping that fucking everything's alright.
[04:46.29]No, this idiot's killing people.
[04:50.53]You can't take a teleporter in peace.
[04:53.81]Why is that?
[04:54.47]Demo's a goner.
[05:00.34]Are you fucking joking, man?
[05:05.19]Oh my fucking god, with this teleporter.
[05:11.60]With this teleporter.
[05:12.76]No, the scout blocked it!
[05:29.75]The scout blocked it!
[05:34.43]Finally!
[05:34.92]He would have died!
[05:36.50]You are the dumbest person I've ever met.
[05:39.56]Get out of my face.
[05:40.82]Teleporter coming right up.
[05:41.42]Let's go!
[05:41.60]Who is not ready?
[06:04.48]I saw you looking at me funny before I went AFK.
[06:07.35]I don't know.
[06:13.49]I quit.
[06:16.21]Hold on.
[06:17.38]Are you ready for this strat tag?
[06:20.94]Oh my.
[06:21.94]Yeah, good job.
[06:22.86]Didn't work.
[06:23.60]Didn't work, asshole.
[06:24.84]Yeah, it just worked.
[06:26.10]No, no, no, not you.
[06:27.97]And the star's an idiot.
[06:33.40]Oh my god.
[06:35.34]See ya.
[06:35.54]I feel like you died, Tech.
[06:38.60]Oh my god.
[06:39.60]Alright, I'm gonna take this opportunity to use 1,993 credits to buy everything for my bottle.
[06:50.91]Did you just fall for it?
[06:52.33]Right, I did.
[06:58.63]I knew that was going to happen.
[06:59.43]I did it on purpose because it was a funny joke.
[07:02.25]I want to see how well he's doing this.
[07:04.21]My bottle is fully upgraded.
[07:07.34]Oh, he's doing it very well.
[07:09.76]I've learned the strats.
[07:11.36]It ain't going to happen this week.
[07:12.58]It's not going to happen.
[07:13.79]What about Rescue Rangering it?
[07:16.31]Wait.
[07:17.07]Activate it.
[07:18.41]That would be better.
[07:19.11]Nope.
[07:20.37]It worked.
[07:21.92]It worked.
[07:23.12]It's definitely a thing.
[07:24.10]I'm gonna be so mad if this idiot gets an Australian weapon.
[07:27.14]I'm gonna be so mad.
[07:30.67]That's actually... That's probably actually worth, like... I deserve it.
[07:37.13]Yeah, this is what he does.
[07:39.29]He's a total dick.
[07:41.29]He's probably going to use it in YouTube.
[07:43.58]He's probably going to make a video like, look at when I trolled everybody and put this thing underneath them.
[07:50.62]In that voice.
[07:51.32]Hey guys, welcome to another Star Video.
[07:53.70]This time I put teleporters underneath people.
[07:56.27]Why would I do that?
[07:58.85]Is that what it's going to be?
[08:00.39]Please like and subscribe.
[08:01.53]Yeah, I say that.
