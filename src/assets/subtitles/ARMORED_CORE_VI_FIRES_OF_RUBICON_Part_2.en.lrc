[00:28.15]Hey guys, remember Jerma promised to play Dead Space before his 40th birthday.
[00:35.19]That's true.
[00:40.39]No, it's true.
[00:45.97]I got a while.
[00:49.37]Still, uh, still fine with that statement, by the way.
[01:01.73]I am doing good.
[01:05.21]I have been itching to play Armored Core, but I decided I wasn't going to play it off stream.
[01:13.91]I decided I was going to continue to play it on stream.
[01:22.50]We'll see after today.
[01:29.96]It's fun.
[01:31.38]I'm going to have to re-familiarize myself with the controls because it has been a week and a half or so since I played it.
[01:41.04]By the way, yes, there is a logo on my character and it's one that I made.
[01:48.60]I got kind of inspiration.
[01:51.60]I saw, hey, look at these decals.
[01:53.00]Look at these decals.
[01:53.64]I'm going to make one.
[01:55.02]Let me try making one.
[01:58.69]Mine's not as good as the others I've seen, but hey, this editor is a lot of fun.
[02:06.01]It reminds me of the 2K14 editor.
[02:09.43]Just way better than the new ones.
[02:16.08]I don't know what boss people are referring to, but I don't think I've seen it yet.
[02:23.28]He's fishing for compliments.
[02:24.72]Yeah, I spent a little time on it.
[02:29.70]It's alright.
[02:31.02]What do you guys think?
[02:37.85]Bro, you're gonna get filtered.
[02:39.23]We already went over this.
[02:41.19]That's not here.
[02:42.17]That's not accurate here.
[02:46.53]Come on.
[02:46.89]Come on, Gwen.
[02:49.03]Give it a rest.
[02:49.79]Come on.
[02:54.12]Let him fish.
[02:54.86]He deserves compliments.
[02:55.82]Oh, by the way.
[02:57.97]Have I ever clearly stated that frozen red grapes are the best snack in the world?
[03:03.93]Have I been on the record saying that yet?
[03:08.31]Did I?
[03:08.63]Have I actually been on the record saying that?
[03:12.17]Frozen red grapes is the single best possible thing that the human body can eat.
[03:18.11]Like, I'm convinced.
[03:23.18]They are so unbelievably good.
[03:25.88]It's not even funny.
[03:30.69]Those of you that have never had, remember, frozen all the way through.
[03:36.25]None of this half-frozen shit, because it takes a little while for them to freeze all the way through.
[03:43.70]Red grapes.
[03:44.76]Wash them.
[03:46.86]You know, take off the stem.
[03:49.25]Get them in a little container.
[03:50.63]Freeze them overnight.
[03:52.65]You open that.
[03:54.11]Eat one.
[03:54.66]Don't just chomp right into it.
[03:57.10]Let it sit for a minute.
[03:59.44]Bite into it.
[04:00.88]You know, it's frozen, so it's going to be really cold.
[04:02.80]Just to make sure you know that.
[04:03.58]If you're into that.
[04:05.89]It's like one of the greatest snacks ever.
[04:12.19]I eat them almost every day or every other day.
[04:15.47]They just turn... Grapes are so much better when they're frozen.
[04:18.06]I don't even really like grapes.
[04:21.33]They're good.
[04:21.85]They're okay.
[04:23.25]But holy shit.
[04:25.34]You freeze them and it changes everything.
[04:27.82]The whole thing changes.
[04:28.80]Yeah, if you have sensitive teeth, be careful.
[04:34.70]But they don't... Oh my... It's not like an ice cube.
[04:37.59]They turn into this weird, like, chewy jelly is the only way I can describe it.
[04:45.63]If you know, you know.
[04:48.27]It's unbelievable.
[04:52.21]And all the people saying EU, you just open up your mind a little, please.
[04:57.75]Open up your mind a little.
[04:58.77]You can say EU to frozen grapes.
[05:00.16]Open your mind a little, please.
[05:06.82]What kind of grapes?
[05:07.74]Just red grapes.
[05:10.10]Green grapes are okay with this formula.
[05:14.22]But it's the red ones, the smaller red ones, that are way better.
[05:21.04]Seedless.
[05:22.74]Seedless grapes.
[05:25.02]No, they're not crunchy.
[05:25.78]They're chewy.
[05:27.02]You'll get it when you understand.
[05:28.18]And I'm telling you, it's going to be like a five gum commercial when you eat one of these.
[05:33.43]I just changed your life.
[05:35.39]Well, I didn't.
[05:36.07]That sounds like I'm taking credit for that.
[05:38.35]I had frozen grapes a lot when I was younger.
[05:42.23]Something was like, you know what?
[05:43.13]I'm going to do it.
[05:43.79]I feel like doing it.
[05:44.43]So I'm going to freeze some.
[05:47.13]So frozen grapes are going to change your life.
[05:49.63]Not me.
[05:53.51]See, I made this up.
[05:55.17]I came up with this.
[05:56.09]Alright, you guys good?
[06:02.25]I'm going to play Armored Core 6.
[06:05.87]Stream for a little bit.
[06:07.07]We'll see if I'm still into it in another hour or two.
[06:10.49]Maybe I just keep playing it.
[06:11.49]If not, after like an hour or two, I kind of want to play Coin Game.
[06:16.41]I got an update a few months ago.
[06:17.69]They added a bunch of new machines and stuff.
[06:19.07]I like playing it.
[06:23.33]So we'll see.
[06:23.79]I'm just going to wing it today.
[06:31.48]Here we go.
[06:34.34]Oh, let me show you my unit.
[06:37.66]Wait, should it be a surprise?
[06:45.05]Let's see.
[06:47.87]Here we go.
[06:49.21]Ah, take a look.
[06:57.32]See, I made this one.
[06:59.28]It sucks.
[06:59.74]That's how you can tell.
[07:01.04]I made this one.
[07:02.52]I got inspiration from everybody that was making them.
[07:04.38]I was like, you know what?
[07:05.00]I'm going to try.
[07:06.41]I made 10 minutes.
[07:07.81]It took me like 15 minutes.
[07:08.91]10 minutes.
[07:13.99]There.
[07:14.33]I told you I was going to do it.
[07:19.27]Actually pretty nice.
[07:21.03]I've seen some really clean ones.
[07:27.50]I think the teeth are a little fucked up.
[07:29.92]I think I may have messed the teeth up a little, but it's OK.
[07:37.25]Do you make the paint have no wear?
[07:38.81]I kind of like the wear.
[07:44.75]Cool, alright, I'm ready.
[07:46.23]So is this the mission everyone's going to laugh at me for?
[07:50.31]Is this like the here it is?
[07:53.63]Operation Wall Climber.
[07:54.75]Alright, let's just go.
[07:56.69]I'm ready.
[08:01.22]How's the audio?
[08:02.66]Are we good?
[08:04.23]Oh yeah, on second glance, it sucks.
[08:06.57]You were just looking for the go-ahead from me to make fun of it.
[08:09.05]I get it.
[08:09.57]I respect that. ...
[08:31.47]I got two big cannons, right?
[08:32.95]I got it.
[08:33.61]He's not paying attention.
[08:34.39]It's four buttons in a dodge.
[08:35.71]I'll be fine.
[08:36.35]Oh, okay.
[08:36.99]Juggernaut.
[08:37.41]Okay.
[09:06.60]I got it.
[09:12.24]Can you make more clay creatures?
[09:13.54]I want hobby updates.
[09:15.24]I actually haven't really.
[09:16.88]I really haven't.
[09:19.26]I've been kind of busy though.
[09:21.62]I'll get back into it.
[09:22.32]I will.
[09:24.42]Alright.
[09:25.20]I got two cannons.
[09:26.50]I got the quad missile launchers on both shoulders.
[09:31.13]I think I'm good.
[09:32.21]Let's just go.
[09:37.96]He's going to remember the dash.
[09:39.10]It's X, right?
[09:39.88]You need to try crocheting.
[09:53.28]The problem with me with crocheting is I agree with you.
[09:56.82]I would sit down, I'd have on my thread.
[09:58.24]Like, okay, let's get started.
[09:59.74]I'm going to take the green and the blue and I'm going to start to crochet.
[10:02.70]I'm going to stand up and fucking walk in a circle.
[10:06.12]And then I'm going to go get like a water and then pace for five minutes and then sit back down.
[10:12.08]I can't.
[10:12.78]I can't do it.
[10:13.24]Alright, here we go.
[10:20.22]Destroy the city.
[10:21.37]Gatling cannon.
[10:23.50]I got it.
[10:23.80]Easy.
[10:26.16]Up there.
[10:28.30]Oh yeah.
[10:31.60]Oh yeah, that's right.
[10:32.14]We're like a corporation.
[10:33.26]Oh, that hurt.
[10:33.96]Can I reach up there?
[10:43.97]What's a heal?
[10:44.47]Alright, I gotta remember the buttons.
[10:49.21]It's been a while.
[10:54.19]How do you turn boost off?
[10:57.29]What's that?
[10:57.55]Okay.
[10:57.65]Alright.
[10:57.87]Alright.
[10:58.55]Now, B is boost, right?
[11:00.09]Okay.
[11:00.51]Yep.
[11:01.99]Left stick is that.
[11:03.69]Alright.
[11:07.48]I got to get up there.
[11:08.02]Alright.
[11:12.64]Who else is shooting over here?
[11:13.68]You?
[11:13.86]I need full boost for this.
[11:26.16]What about Baldur's Gate 3?
[11:27.88]I actually just barely started to... Hold on.
[11:31.02]I can't talk right now.
[11:33.08]I actually just barely started to care about Baldur's Gate 3.
[11:43.69]Oh my god!
[11:44.95]What is even shooting at me?
[11:51.91]Oh!
[11:54.21]Alright, cannon's down.
[12:02.19]What's left?
[12:09.77]Up here?
[12:10.07]Destroy the city gatling cannon.
[12:12.97]And tetrapod MT.
[12:14.57]Where is that shit?
[12:18.62]Not up top, right?
[12:21.22]Bro is never going to play Hylics 2.
[12:23.00]Yes, I am.
[12:25.10]I promise.
[12:26.81]At some point.
[12:27.53]I mean, those things are weak.
[12:34.25]I just have to kill them.
[12:45.38]You also promised Paper Mario.
[12:46.74]Yeah, but for my 40th birthday.
[12:48.04]I got plenty of time.
[12:50.42]Oh, here we go.
[12:51.52]This thing.
[12:57.38]Oh!
[12:59.56]I can't just sit there and stare at it.
[13:01.96]Okay, I get it.
[13:02.52]I get it.
[13:02.74]I get it.
[13:02.96]I'm gonna be alright.
[13:03.40]Alright, I'm dead.
[13:06.92]Alright, I get it.
[13:08.46]I get it.
[13:08.72]I get it.
[13:09.06]Alright.
[13:09.86]I haven't played this game in like two weeks.
[13:18.85]The last time you saw me play this game was the last time I had the controller in my hand.
[13:22.87]Alright, it's all these fucking dickheads right here.
[13:29.65]What was that?
[13:30.15]I don't know what just happened.
[13:32.20]It's got to keep moving.
[13:35.06]That's all it is.
[13:54.20]Keep moving, keep moving, keep moving, keep moving!
[13:55.72]Come on, come on, come on!
[13:56.52]Alright, uh, maybe I shouldn't have the weapon where you have to stand still to use it.
[14:03.77]That's probably a bad idea.
[14:20.01]Yeah, the two weapons I have on left trigger and right trigger, I have to stand still for two seconds to use them.
[14:25.90]Bad idea.
[14:35.54]See?
[14:35.98]Alright, that's better than what I did last time.
[14:41.29]We're good.
[14:42.71]Alright, here.
[14:44.29]Land already.
[14:44.89]There we go.
[14:45.29]Alright, here we go.
[14:58.65]Okay.
[14:59.39]Damn.
[15:11.64]Alright, should I just go right for the guy and not like the 50 people on the wall shooting me?
[15:19.26]Or should I try to clear everything first?
[15:20.50]Because there's a million people on this wall.
[15:25.95]I'm playing it wrong.
[15:37.83]Ow, shit.
[15:51.44]Shit!
[15:53.36]This game is really hard.
[15:59.06]Alright, I'm doing this because these things stink here.
[16:17.26]Should I buy something new?
[16:18.10]Just machine guns, probably.
[16:30.21]I'm going to try the machine guns.
[16:32.93]That's going to work, right?
[16:38.89]Did that go through?
[16:41.63]Alright, it did.
[16:45.28]Alright, this should be a little bit better.
[16:48.08]Use the melee weapons?
[16:49.52]The melee weapons are fun.
[17:08.82]Alright, let me... I'm going to take this really slow.
[17:11.46]That's a bad idea.
[17:12.02]Okay.
[17:21.38]So I should never be in the air.
[17:24.27]Or like not in the air, but... Should always be moving like as fast as I can.
[17:29.99]Oh my god.
[17:30.69]Alright, it's only this group right in front of the bridge, right?
[17:43.24]There's people everywhere.
[17:44.24]I'm just going to clear everything wicked slow.
[17:55.69]Do the frontal assault.
[18:02.53]I'm almost afraid to lose all my boost before I even get over here.
[18:05.93]I'm going this way.
[18:19.21]I wish I could just snipe this guy up here.
[18:20.63]This guy's ruining everything.
[18:27.53]I didn't what?
[18:29.79]This guy got homing shit on his bullshit.
[18:31.71]That's the boss.
[18:36.86]Oh, well, that's why he's so annoying.
[18:45.33]Okay, I gotta hit.
[18:54.75]Alright, where is this other guy?
[18:55.81]Alright, he's dead.
[19:11.24]What chassis has the most boost?
[19:27.21]My God, I can't kill this thing.
[19:34.96]Okay, so here are the 50 things on the wall.
[19:41.52]How do I fight this guy one-on-one?
[19:43.86]Do I just don't?
[19:51.43]Just ignore these things.
[19:52.89]I feel like it's kind of hard to look at this.
[20:03.20]Destroy them all.
[20:04.48]I guess I could just kind of left there.
[20:11.24]Ow no no no.
[20:12.58]I have no healing.
[20:32.89]Alright, that was a little bit better.
[20:33.77]I want different items.
[20:40.05]I don't like these.
[20:44.70]Nice bit rate.
[20:51.46]Okay, what is going on here?
[20:53.08]What is this thing?
[20:57.63]This looks kind of good.
[21:08.60]I want something that takes down the... What is it called?
[21:10.80]The shield?
[21:16.22]Maybe the big... Yeah, the big guns... I have to stand still, though, and I get hit too quickly.
[21:24.03]Maybe I should get the shield thing.
[21:28.65]I feel like when I jump up, I just see like... Like 10 lasers just go right on top of me.
[21:37.39]Maybe I could just block them.
[21:44.79]Is this the back?
[21:45.95]What does this thing do?
[21:47.75]Laser cannon on the back.
[21:50.19]Ooh, looks cool.
[21:52.39]Do little missiles.
[21:54.57]That takes a long time, though.
[21:59.75]That takes a long time, too.
[22:02.14]It looks good.
[22:10.04]That's like an AOE.
[22:10.76]I kind of want to try this.
[22:12.53]This is expensive, but I want it.
[22:14.35]Vertical missiles are OP.
[22:17.17]Verts are OP.
[22:18.29]Okay.
[22:22.47]It takes a long time to reload, but I feel like I'm just going to be... I'm going to be a coward.
[22:25.28]Okay, here we go.
[22:25.76]I'm buying it.
[22:27.46]Let me put it on.
[22:39.67]It does way more damage, too.
[22:44.52]What about the... What should I get for the other side?
[22:50.30]Can you doy doy doy?
[22:51.44]Yeah, for old time's sake, sure.
[22:54.48]You know, so we can remember the good old days.
[23:04.59]Use the sword.
[23:05.13]I actually agree with that.
[23:06.89]I genuinely agree with that.
[23:08.37]I love that sword.
[23:09.65]It was very good.
[23:13.17]But what do I want on the right side?
[23:14.43]Something... Something better.
[23:18.02]Something a little flashier.
[23:30.66]What's this?
[23:32.38]Ooh!
[23:32.64]Ooh!
[23:34.28]I want this.
[23:34.62]Alright, this might be a terrible design, but who cares?
[23:47.49]Shotgun.
[23:51.39]Shotgun blade.
[23:55.11]Little missiles, big missiles.
[23:58.93]I think it's alright.
[24:03.05]Going with no weapons.
[24:04.31]Just go out and use punch with my hands.
[24:13.05]I think I'm alright with this.
[24:13.82]Alright.
[24:14.10]It's time to try.
[24:15.84]Those were all just... I was just doing those to... Alright.
[24:20.52]This is the real one.
[24:21.12]This is the real one.
[24:21.72]This is the one that's for real.
[24:28.50]This is going to shred.
[24:29.42]Alright.
[24:29.66]This is...
[24:32.32]I did my warm-up.
[24:34.28]Here we go.
[24:34.70]Alright, check it out.
[24:39.30]Just go.
[24:39.68]Get out of here.
[24:40.70]Get out of here!
[24:43.51]Get out of here!
[25:02.52]Where's the other?
[25:03.04]Alright, what was shooting from behind?
[25:05.56]You see that?
[25:11.40]It gave me an indicator that something was shooting.
[25:13.38]What is shooting at me?
[25:14.40]There's people down here.
[25:15.40]Okay, I'm just testing it out.
[25:25.15]Alright, that's a shotgun.
[25:27.69]Alright, I'm just going to clear shit.
[25:36.33]OK, alright, everything here's down here is dead.
[25:38.51]It's not.
[25:38.93]It's not a race.
[25:39.93]It's not a race.
[25:48.50]God damn it.
[25:50.30]Why do I feel like I have no boost?
[25:51.92]Do I have like a shit chassis on?
[25:53.82]OK, let's go.
[26:04.25]Wrapping around this way.
[26:12.15]Alright, that's good.
[26:21.83]Alright, good.
[26:33.77]Come on target.
[26:38.24]Is dead.
[26:42.75]Where are they going?
[26:43.35]Alright, alright, that one's dead.
[26:50.95]Fuck you!
[26:52.86]Oh my god, this is correct.
[26:56.94]Oh my god, this is correct.
[27:00.56]I figured it out, this is correct.
[27:04.68]Oh, this is correct!
[27:16.49]Get rid of these.
[27:17.07]Okay.
[27:26.16]Why do you have a Christmas laugh?
[27:29.12]That was like a comedy laugh.
[27:30.76]That's not how I actually laugh.
[27:37.38]No, guys, when I'm watching like the latest Will Ferrell movie, I don't go...
[27:44.02]That's just like, oh, I'm excited because I'm doing something fun right now.
[27:47.97]That's not that's not how I laugh at jokes.
[27:57.72]Oh.
[28:12.12]Fuck off!
[28:17.58]Kill this motherfucker!
[28:27.41]Get him, get him, get him, get him!
[28:31.13]Oh my god, I'm out of bullets.
[28:33.10]Where's my boost?
[28:44.02]Got him.
[28:44.34]Okay.
[28:46.18]Alright, don't.
[28:47.28]I'm not going to fuck this up.
[28:49.24]I'm going to take it really slow.
[28:52.48]Dead.
[28:52.64]Okay.
[28:52.98]I'm going to take it very slow.
[29:21.04]Alright, now I take these out.
[29:22.92]We're good.
[29:24.48]Use the jump pads.
[29:27.48]I forget what they look like.
[29:28.10]What do they look like?
[29:28.62]Alright, here we go.
[29:50.71]Shoot somebody.
[29:51.35]What are you doing?
[29:53.56]I was trying to lock on to everybody.
[29:55.06]Alright, we're good.
[30:04.06]Alright.
[30:05.35]I beat the mission.
[30:06.33]I did it.
[30:06.71]Just have one more.
[30:10.37]Oh, right here.
[30:22.25]OK.
[30:23.75]Break in up there.
[30:31.42]Launching missile.
[30:33.50]At target.
[30:40.64]Let's go.
[30:41.10]I did it.
[30:42.20]Be prepared.
[30:50.67]That is crash.
[30:52.47]Oh.
[30:56.61]Be prepared for close quarters combat.
[30:58.63]But those all those went through.
[31:04.86]Alright, I got it.
[31:05.62]I got it.
[31:07.18]Do you read me?
[31:08.26]This is V4 Rusty.
[31:10.86]You're fast.
[31:12.22]Guess you're sharper than they say.
[31:14.85]I'll have to step up my own game.
[31:16.81]Who's talking?
[31:26.43]Alright, this is more my speed here.
[31:42.18]Alright, scanning.
[31:46.58]What type of pie should I bake?
[31:51.96]A pumpkin.
[32:10.45]Get over here.
[32:20.83]Oh, yes.
[32:21.23]Pumpkin pie.
[32:21.87]The best.
[32:24.92]Pumpkin pie is good.
[32:25.84]I don't know if I'd say pumpkin pie is the best, though.
[32:31.52]Pumpkin pie is... I used to hate it, but now I genuinely love it.
[32:37.71]I love one piece of pumpkin pie, no more than one.
[32:43.19]No more than one piece of pumpkin pie.
[32:46.14]That's overdoing it.
[32:46.84]Is there a boss up here that I have to?
[33:02.67]Would you ever do infomercials?
[33:03.95]Oh 100% yeah.
[33:05.75]I was thinking about doing that recently.
[33:12.38]A supply Sherpa.
[33:16.93]Oh, is this going to give me full heals again?
[33:18.33]That sounds pretty great.
[33:31.86]Have you seen Evangelion?
[33:33.40]I have not.
[33:34.34]I've seen pieces of it.
[33:36.16]I've seen the final scene.
[33:38.50]I've seen the last sequence of that show.
[33:43.67]Alright, here we go.
[33:44.93]Do I have a checkpoint here?
[33:46.49]Or do I gotta really lock it in?
[33:52.04]Alright, I'm gonna lock it in.
[34:00.02]Great.
[34:08.56]Oh, I thought you guys were all calling me rusty at the game because I haven't played it in a while.
[34:19.73]This is what you're talking about.
[34:26.83]Alright, let's do it.
[34:28.69]Got it.
[34:28.95]Blind spot like right here.
[34:31.31]Oops.
[34:31.65]Get right up there with the shotgun right in the guts.
[35:03.47]Stay right here.
[35:22.39]Get him, get him, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[35:38.42]Hey, hey, hey!
[35:39.86]What?
[35:40.30]Why did that not hurt?
[35:46.54]I know!
[35:46.88]Don't think I know how much shit I have left.
[35:49.85]The air conditioner is blowing all my air in my face!
[36:11.62]My hair is all over my... It's in my mouth and shit right now, I swear to God.
[36:14.31]I need boost right now!
[36:46.83]I did it first try.
[36:47.47]I win.
[36:48.19]I win.
[36:48.57]I did it first try.
[36:52.79]I win the ultimate game of can you play Armored Course 6 and you're a live streamer and you sit here and play these games and you suck at them all.
[36:59.26]I win.
[37:03.81]But pilot rusty.
[37:06.05]It seems he knew who you really are.
[37:07.72]It won't matter.
[37:10.54]I've taken that contingency into account.
[37:18.80]Rude.
[37:20.20]No, I'm saying I'm pretending to be you guys.
[37:23.58]Streamer can't do it.
[37:24.28]He sucks at everything.
[37:24.96]There's no way.
[37:26.34]But I won did it.
[37:28.20]I was being you.
[37:32.15]Next boss, he's quitting.
[37:33.47]I'm calling it.
[37:38.26]I'm going to beat the next boss just because you're here.
[37:49.39]First try.
[37:50.21]I'm not going to say first try, but I'm going to do it.
[37:53.81]One new message.
[38:00.87]We're war buddies now.
[38:02.25]I think I should tell you something.
[38:04.81]During Operation Wall Climber... You got stuck on the easy part of that mission.
[38:09.12]That's how it is, though.
[38:10.74]The plan was to use independent mercenaries to clear the way so that the Vetspers could step in and take over.
[38:16.96]But instead, you took the wall.
[38:18.84]It's like that.
[38:20.22]The higher-ups are going to remember you now, that's for sure.
[38:24.02]As will I.
[38:26.49]Bro, you're gonna get filtered like water on the next boss.
[38:28.85]You know, you guys have been saying that.
[38:30.41]This is the third boss now.
[38:34.48]At what point have you put me through the water filter enough times where I am just pure water?
[38:44.18]Like, I'm going through the filter.
[38:48.57]Sorry.
[38:50.47]Uh, there's new stuff.
[38:51.23]I have a lot of money too.
[38:51.89]I don't know what this is, but I want it.
[38:56.19]Yeah.
[38:56.70]Are you trying to say I'm not going to buy this right now?
[38:59.08]I don't care how bad it is.
[39:03.38]I like this too.
[39:10.11]New blade.
[39:14.09]I like that too.
[39:19.79]What about this thing?
[39:23.20]New training?
[39:23.64]Yeah, I'll do the training.
[39:25.10]You get parts for it, right?
[39:29.88]Ooh.
[39:35.07]Go only melee build?
[39:38.41]I feel like I've done the best with the melee because melee is just like, I kind of just don't even care.
[39:43.07]I'm just going to go in and just swing.
[39:45.21]If I die, I die.
[39:46.25]That's kind of how I'm looking at it.
[39:49.32]The next boss is the one apparently people have broken their controllers over.
[39:54.21]Really?
[39:55.17]Okay, I have to get in the right mindset because I'm not going to get mad.
[39:59.53]I'm not getting mad.
[40:02.25]I'm just going to hang out and play games today.
[40:05.96]I'm not going to put any bite marks into this.
[40:10.04]Whatever.
[40:10.90]If I lose, I lose.
[40:11.96]And if I lose ten times in a row, I lose ten times in a row.
[40:14.64]I'm accepting that right now.
[40:16.90]I'm not going to get angry.
[40:18.94]Okay?
[40:20.54]We're good.
[40:25.16]Just a little nibble.
[40:32.24]Okay, like, who am I kidding?
[40:34.60]And I go like... Six bucks says he gets angry.
[40:40.26]Alright, let's do it.
[40:41.06]You want to do a poll?
[40:42.89]Mods, do a poll.
[40:44.85]You know what?
[40:45.89]Do a channel point poll.
[40:46.83]Let's do it.
[40:47.49]Let's go all in here.
[40:49.55]Will I show genuine anger at this next boss?
[40:55.57]Like, will I... But what does that mean?
[40:57.43]We have to get some ground rules here.
[40:59.67]Are we talking like, can I raise my voice?
[41:01.62]Can I say, this is stupid?
[41:02.88]What am I allowed to do?
[41:04.56]What's the condition?
[41:10.98]I think complaining is fine.
[41:16.51]Any negativity at all.
[41:20.21]Kind of like Virgil.
[41:21.77]Like the Virgil rules.
[41:24.23]Okay.
[41:25.27]No complaining, but can I ask... But here's the thing, can I ask questions?
[41:28.71]Can I be like, I don't understand.
[41:31.18]Like, why am I getting hit by that?
[41:33.06]Right?
[41:33.40]Like, that's a question.
[41:34.52]As long as I put a question mark at the end of anything, I'm gonna be fine.
[41:39.42]Fuck this stupid boss!
[41:41.51]Right, that's me asking a question.
[41:44.17]This guy's such a piece of shit!
[41:47.95]Fuck you!
[41:49.23]These are all questions I'm asking.
[41:50.45]I'm not getting angry.
[41:51.59]I'm asking a question.
[41:53.01]So... I think that's okay.
[41:57.24]You lost the last time you did this.
[41:58.70]I know.
[41:59.40]Alright.
[42:00.42]Let me just do the training.
[42:07.17]Loophole Larry.
[42:08.61]He's already cheating.
[42:19.25]People think I'm going to... Are we just going to move to coin game in like 30 minutes?
[42:22.75]Is that what you guys think is going to happen?
[42:24.21]Okay.
[42:24.53]Well, whatever.
[42:25.69]Let's see what happens.
[42:27.13]Alright.
[42:28.85]Range weapons to both hands.
[42:31.05]The double trigger.
[42:36.40]Um... You hold them both?
[42:43.90]Oh!
[42:47.30]I've actually been looking for that.
[42:55.79]Yeah, this game is stupid.
[42:58.01]This game sucks.
[43:01.07]I'm asking if you guys think this... I'm not saying it.
[43:09.49]I already knew that.
[43:14.15]Oh, right.
[43:15.03]I forgot you could that.
[43:16.16]Alright.
[43:16.72]I have to apologize to everybody watching.
[43:19.24]I forgot that right stick was lock on and I haven't locked on to a single enemy in 40 minutes.
[43:25.08]Forgot.
[43:36.25]Okay.
[43:37.41]Generator installed to your AC greatly influences the rest of your assembly, from the selection of usable parts to the basic performance of the AC.
[43:43.44]Right.
[43:44.72]A generator that prioritizes EN capacity.
[43:49.09]Extensive use of aerial maneuvers.
[43:51.15]Okay, how do I get this one?
[43:52.17]I want this one.
[44:01.82]I like the extended use.
[44:04.20]You have it right now.
[44:06.40]But is it on my actual character?
[44:07.54]Okay.
[44:14.76]Fire control system installed.
[44:15.96]Next target tracking at close, medium, long range and missile lock on multiple.
[44:20.33]Okay.
[44:21.93]Specialized for close range combat, allowing it to reliably land attacks with its high firepower.
[44:26.51]Um, okay.
[44:27.83]So just saying, like, don't fight things.
[44:30.81]This thing is a short range.
[44:33.35]Like, I completely missed.
[44:34.69]Alright, that one, right?
[44:38.78]So that one is more medium short range?
[44:47.94]Oh, it is.
[44:57.66]Nice.
[45:00.95]Armored Core.
[45:05.59]The weapons and selection of parts used to assemble an AC determine its ideal combat range and style.
[45:13.79]Didn't we already know this?
[45:34.37]I do unlock stuff for doing this though, so it's worth doing.
[45:42.11]You're reading the tutorial message like you're explaining it to a kindergarten class.
[45:50.69]Have you watched Mob Psycho like you said you would know?
[45:52.95]I haven't seen the Smurfs movie either.
[46:00.07]What is that?
[46:03.61]New generator?
[46:07.61]Let me do all these because it's just going to unlock stuff.
[46:10.46]So just get them all out of the way.
[46:20.60]Reverse joint parts.
[46:27.65]Yeah.
[46:29.37]Ooh.
[46:29.53]Okay.
[46:35.61]Okay.
[46:42.26]This is like a hopper.
[46:44.02]You hop with this one.
[46:59.87]This one's actually pretty good.
[47:00.73]I feel like I would love this one.
[47:09.60]Okay, is Mob Psycho any good?
[47:10.94]Yeah!
[47:12.53]Yes.
[47:12.89]Yes.
[47:14.19]No.
[47:16.05]Sucks.
[47:16.55]This is going to be one of you.
[47:17.50]Yep.
[47:22.24]Three different types of weapon category.
[47:25.36]Kinetic, explosive, and energy.
[47:29.68]They do different things.
[47:31.44]They do very different things.
[47:33.88]Cool.
[47:34.24]Look at that.
[47:38.34]I'm going to go like that.
[47:40.12]I'm going to go like that.
[47:43.93]Let's go ahead and get... It can bounce?
[47:49.57]Produce heat when fired?
[47:51.75]When overheated, the weapon will be temporarily disabled, right?
[47:54.27]Okay, so just don't overheat it.
[47:57.65]What is the overheat meter?
[48:16.63]Whatever those missiles are on my right shoulder are awesome.
[48:22.33]Okay, that's... I can tell now.
[48:29.60]Ricocheting will occur when enemies have high defense, significantly reducing the damage they take.
[48:34.58]To counteract this, try attacking at a closer range or switch to explosive weapons.
[48:39.39]I've been playing a lot of sorcery.
[48:40.61]I read things like I'm narrating a story.
[49:05.63]And... Charge!
[49:27.99]OK.
[49:30.19]You excited for the Five Nights at Freddy's movie?
[49:35.80]No, not at all.
[49:37.84]I'm just being honest.
[49:41.08]Laser handgun.
[49:48.61]There's two more.
[49:49.55]I want to unlock everything.
[49:53.53]I love upgrades.
[49:54.65]I love unlockables.
[49:55.47]I love upgradables.
[49:59.60]Okay.
[50:02.91]Tetrapod leg units have high loading capacity and enable AC builds equipped with multiple heavy weapons.
[50:09.59]Okay.
[50:10.47]They can switch to hover mode after... Oh, I have legs now.
[50:19.76]Weird.
[50:26.60]Okay.
[50:27.68]I think I found the thing I like.
[50:38.30]How do I get this?
[50:39.00]Because this is all I want.
[50:42.00]I just want the floating machine.
[50:47.91]It's recoil, yep.
[50:50.01]There's grenade launchers.
[50:55.65]They absorb this kind of recoil, allowing these attacks to be... Ooh, I can go back to my missile launcher now.
[51:24.17]I will abuse this though, I think.
[51:26.39]Unfortunately.
[51:36.85]You can stay up a pretty long time too.
[51:39.08]That's actually great.
[51:48.68]There's still the dash though, that's fine.
[51:50.37]Okay, I definitely think these are my favorites so far.
[52:05.93]And hover mode allows you to maintain a high altitude.
[52:09.52]In turn, making it easier to establish a line of fire and log on without geographical obstruction.
[52:14.16]Yes.
[52:14.40]100%.
[52:19.96]This thing is great.
[52:22.98]It didn't go up even higher, too.
[52:42.55]Ooh, cool.
[52:49.29]Do the multi-lock with the shoulder.
[52:53.10]A new grenade launcher.
[52:55.24]Alright, what else?
[52:57.30]One more.
[52:58.52]This tank AC is as well.
[53:01.96]It might be this one.
[53:07.47]I don't know.
[53:11.61]Alright.
[53:11.83]So, it's just good.
[53:13.07]It just works well, I think.
[53:14.67]Oh, yeah, this is the one.
[53:16.33]I'm just playing Twisted Battle now.
[53:42.99]Those that know, they know.
[53:52.96]Those that know, they know.
[53:53.82]And it was a great impression.
[53:59.60]Can drift.
[54:02.64]To execute a drift, move left stick in the direction you want to face immediately after a boost.
[54:16.32]Wait, huh?
[54:18.16]Hold on a sec.
[54:20.30]I'm boosting now.
[54:24.66]Okay, so it has to be like... Like that.
[54:46.93]Okay, I get it Let's go He hates this
[55:15.98]No, I... Okay, I prefer the other one, but I do... I like this one.
[55:22.29]This one's fine.
[55:22.89]Uh, this one's alright.
[55:44.80]This one's okay.
[55:52.48]Lock on.
[55:53.28]That's right.
[55:53.64]I forget it exists.
[55:57.14]New vertical.
[55:58.04]Oh, wait.
[55:58.90]There's a new training.
[56:03.67]We're going to do it.
[56:05.31]Advanced mercenary certification.
[56:08.83]Sure.
[56:18.00]Adaptive assemblies.
[56:19.30]During real missions, you can expect enemy reinforcements and other changes, right?
[56:23.04]Of course.
[56:26.15]Adjust to a wide range of combat scenarios.
[56:29.73]Sure.
[56:30.39]Hold down right trigger and just fly.
[56:32.39]Is that not what I was supposed to do?
[56:34.15]Oh, I'm using my regular loadout.
[56:43.80]For a second, I forgot.
[56:44.54]I thought I had the other stuff on.
[56:51.85]remember what I had on.
[56:52.63]Alright, now here comes a tetrapod.
[57:23.20]Ah, fuck.
[57:23.66]I forgot.
[57:36.23]Oh, shit.
[57:36.87]Did it work?
[57:57.35]Okay, cool.
[58:05.52]Shit, I didn't want to do that.
[58:24.67]Get over here.
[58:52.01]Yes.
[58:58.92]Use lock on.
[59:00.92]I just did.
[59:02.12]Hey, relax, relax.
[59:07.18]Quiet.
[59:10.90]Congratulations, you have proven your skills by completing the entire combat training regimen.
[59:16.56]Registration number RB 23 callsign Raven.
[59:21.62]All mind anticipates excellent don't lock on and reduces your accuracy.
[59:27.02]You guys should figure this out amongst yourselves.
[59:33.57]I'm getting mixed information in the chatroom.
[59:39.47]Okay.
[59:41.21]Where's the one where I can't be mad?
[59:51.82]Wait, does this go for the whole time I'm playing?
[59:56.26]Okay, so I'm allowed to be angry right now, right?
[59:59.30]Okay, good.
[60:04.66]I got to get it out of my system then.
[60:05.86]Okay.
[60:11.58]What did I get?
[60:12.06]New stuff.
[60:16.00]I want to try the bubble gun.
[60:17.00]I feel like I'm playing Mega Man.
[60:18.96]I got the new Mega Man power.
[60:20.26]I want to use it.
[60:28.02]Alright, I need help.
[60:28.86]Can I have some help?
[60:31.30]I want to ask another question.
[60:32.84]Can I ask a question?
[60:34.62]So this is damage.
[60:36.46]This is the Sekiro bar.
[60:40.82]This is the... Uh, what's this one?
[60:53.28]That's the sustained Sekiro bar.
[60:58.94]this is when this is my overheat meter which is pretty high right now so of the really important okay attack power impact and ammo those are the main important ones there are no weapons that I have that overheat right now okay that's good so realistically it's just damage
[61:25.51]Sekiro bar, ammo, how heavy you are, and how much boost you can use.
[61:31.03]That's what EN load is, right?
[61:32.33]Or do I have that backwards?
[61:34.61]Wait, no, no, no.
[61:35.35]Okay, boost speed.
[61:43.64]EN load weight.
[61:44.94]EN is how much capacity you have.
[61:47.34]The weight limit for weapon energy.
[61:49.42]Okay.
[61:52.00]Which one of these is boost?
[61:52.99]Boost.
[61:58.56]Attitude stability.
[62:00.42]OK, so this is essentially secure bar defense.
[62:09.40]Boost is under boosters.
[62:10.66]OK, I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing here.
[62:18.10]Alright, what about on this arm?
[62:24.60]What about the different laser blades?
[62:27.38]This thing seems like just way more damage.
[62:31.48]Oh, it only swings once.
[62:41.55]But I think I like it better.
[62:42.79]Alright, EN shortfall.
[62:48.61]What's that mean?
[62:49.35]That means I'm too heavy?
[62:58.69]Not enough energy.
[63:03.89]This one's only four.
[63:07.49]That's one of the new ones I got, right?
[63:16.72]Get a better generator.
[63:21.24]Oh, that's right.
[63:21.84]We have arms and legs.
[63:23.00]Alright.
[63:25.90]Uh, booster generator.
[63:30.59]How much money do I have?
[63:31.87]This one's better.
[63:32.35]This one weighs more.
[63:38.06]Okay.
[63:41.22]This isn't the shop.
[63:44.18]I know.
[63:44.72]I'm just trying to internalize a lot of this.
[63:52.27]Look at the thrust on this one.
[63:55.87]The upward thrust is terrible though.
[64:04.74]Should I try it?
[64:13.23]Close range assist.
[64:16.33]Help!
[64:18.85]My hand is up in the air.
[64:19.80]I'm waiting to be called on.
[64:21.38]What does this mean?
[64:27.95]Aiming assistance performance at close range.
[64:29.81]Higher values improve aim when targeting enemies at close range.
[64:33.92]Alright, so this is... I lose long range assist.
[64:39.92]Do I care, though?
[64:41.42]Eh, I'll try.
[64:41.84]I'll use this other generator.
[64:45.04]I'll put that on, whatever.
[64:49.81]This game is so customizable.
[64:58.24]How much money do I have?
[65:02.59]Look at all this stuff.
[65:10.71]Ooh.
[65:11.66]Medium range assist?
[65:13.72]I actually might want that.
[65:20.55]You can sell stuff you're not using.
[65:22.59]Yeah, that's true.
[65:24.35]But let me just stumble.
[65:27.55]Let me just not look into that at all.
[65:30.32]Stumble through the next few missions.
[65:32.34]Complain about the game.
[65:34.80]Not do any research on the chassis at all.
[65:39.26]Say that the game is bad and that I don't want to play anymore.
[65:44.21]I think that's probably a good idea.
[65:52.91]Let's go!
[65:55.27]That's the way.
[65:56.45]This is the way.
[65:57.21]This is the way.
[66:01.93]I've done that shit before.
[66:03.09]Many times.
[66:06.32]I think I'm happy with what I got.
[66:07.24]It's gonna be easy.
[66:14.32]You're too self-aware.
[66:15.38]Maybe.
[66:15.82]Hmm.
[66:23.25]These are baby missions.
[66:24.51]Why does your robot look so stupid?
[66:26.31]Hey relax.
[66:26.73]Hey relax.
[66:49.54]I've said that a few times today.
[66:51.80]Hey, relax, alright?
[66:54.18]Are you going to do a nun cosplay?
[66:57.64]No.
[67:11.48]Why would I do... Well, I mean, I guess I could do nun cosplay for the release of that new movie, the new horror movie.
[67:20.25]The Nun 2.
[67:23.69]In theaters this Friday.
[67:30.01]I have no idea when that movie comes out.
[67:31.25]621, you should be used to Rubicon by now.
[67:42.15]Is that a real movie?
[67:58.04]Yeah.
[67:58.90]None.
[67:59.38]He's going to be a vampire for Halloween.
[68:00.96]Yeah, we already discussed that.
[68:02.06]I only got four minutes.
[68:14.48]Did I just friendly fire kill that person?
[68:18.06]Alright, got one.
[68:19.00]Oh.
[68:19.14]Cool.
[68:19.76]Alright, more?
[68:23.31]Oh, it takes a long time to load that one.
[68:48.67]I like the bubble gun a lot.
[68:50.89]I think it's fantastic.
[69:09.66]Any more?
[69:10.00]I just need to find a couple more, right?
[69:14.02]Not down here.
[69:18.91]There's one over here.
[69:26.07]Ow!
[69:33.84]Alright, give me, give me, give me.
[69:38.74]Where are you?
[69:41.58]Cut it out!
[69:43.32]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[69:44.48]Hey, cut the crap, okay?
[69:45.84]Hey, cut the crap!
[69:55.75]Did I not get it?
[69:59.33]Oh, right.
[70:07.45]Somebody said, you are so cringe.
[70:13.09]Do I apologize?
[70:13.89]Do I have to say sorry?
[70:18.65]Hey, cut the crap, alright?
[70:36.88]Has one here.
[70:37.46]Analyzing.
[70:43.40]You're a corn ball.
[70:47.46]Um.
[70:47.78]Worthless.
[70:48.52]Yeah, I mean.
[70:49.92]Keep an eye on the clock.
[70:51.10]Either afford combat or make it quick.
[70:53.86]Whatever.
[70:55.77]Oh, I can't go that way.
[70:59.11]Stop.
[70:59.79]That's five logs.
[71:06.82]Got it.
[71:19.24]Bubble gun is the best gun in the game.
[71:30.29]Okay, so is it more?
[71:31.37]I think I got everything, didn't I?
[71:37.03]Did I knock everything?
[71:40.46]There's more in the hole.
[71:46.30]Uh.
[71:54.12]Go into the pit.
[72:00.23]Oh shit.
[72:08.45]I didn't even know you could go down.
[72:09.49]Where's the other one?
[72:18.76]Where's the other one?
[72:19.20]Where's the other one?
[72:20.76]Where's the other one?
[72:21.26]Where's the other one?
[72:22.08]Where's the other one?
[72:23.03]Where's the other one?
[72:24.25]Where's the other one?
[72:25.07]Where's the other one?
[72:25.87]There's two.
[72:26.39]There's two.
[72:26.77]Did I do it?
[72:28.67]Oh, I did it.
[72:29.47]I got it.
[72:39.22]Okay, I thought I had to get them all.
[72:43.76]Two more optional ones.
[72:44.50]Um, yeah, that's cool.
[72:51.54]I like how this is a snow level.
[72:52.98]Yeah, me too.
[72:56.84]Two new messages.
[72:59.56]What do we got?
[73:04.43]Gun 13 Raven.
[73:06.63]Bagged us some decent intel on V4.
[73:10.67]Filter incoming.
[73:12.03]I wanted to take one hit from the boss.
[73:15.87]Just talk about how bad the game is.
[73:18.69]But I can't do that.
[73:19.44]I have to be real.
[73:20.02]People bet channel points on this.
[73:22.42]I have to be.
[73:22.90]I gotta take it seriously.
[73:42.10]More upgrades?
[73:42.48]What was the, um, the ratio?
[73:43.38]Was it like 2 to 1, 3 to 1, 4 to 1 for I'm going to get mad to not get mad?
[73:46.50]Was 4 to 1, 4 to 1 to get mad or 4 to 1?
[73:47.94]Oh, it's been refunded.
[73:48.76]Okay, I see.
[73:49.30]We'll do it when we get up there.
[73:51.34]I see.
[74:13.06]I can now do OS tuning and arena.
[74:14.86]Apply OS upgrades.
[74:21.48]Expend OST chips in your possession to upgrade your AC's OS from the OS tuning menu.
[74:27.72]Really?
[74:33.26]Weight control.
[74:34.40]Quick turn.
[74:39.30]Boost kick.
[74:42.16]Weapon Bay.
[74:45.06]Which one of these would you guys say is very important?
[74:50.44]Probably this one.
[74:53.18]Boost Kick.
[74:55.56]I don't have enough to do it.
[74:58.47]That's cool.
[74:59.31]I'm imagining this is PvP.
[75:02.57]Probably.
[75:02.89]Is it multiplayer or something?
[75:07.17]No.
[75:07.31]No.
[75:10.08]Fight virtual battles against copies of ACs created using all mines mercenary craft data from the arena menu.
[75:15.36]Oh, this is how you get chips.
[75:24.87]Invincible.
[75:27.19]Okay.
[75:28.43]Cool.
[75:30.31]It's 1v1.
[75:31.67]Do you just go against people's creations?
[75:33.45]Is that how it works?
[75:35.81]That's kind of cool.
[75:40.19]Oh yeah, sort of.
[75:43.69]Do all those.
[75:44.39]A lot of content in this game.
[75:49.57]Let me do this mission first.
[75:52.80]Those are dev creations.
[75:55.84]Got a job for you 621.
[75:58.86]The client is the Rubicon Liberation Front.
[76:01.88]Here's the briefing.
[76:04.32]The loss of the wall dealt us a heavy blow.
[76:15.30]This level?
[76:15.86]This level.
[76:16.30]Okay.
[76:16.50]LOL.
[76:16.70]Why?
[76:16.80]Did you buy the kick?
[76:20.14]No, I didn't.
[76:20.62]Didn't have enough?
[76:47.35]This level is easy.
[76:48.99]You got it.
[76:49.63]This level is hard, but it's not the filter.
[76:53.05]Okay.
[76:53.23]Then let me try.
[76:54.48]Are you excited for the new Saw movie?
[77:13.77]Okay.
[77:14.85]I saw... I saw Spiral.
[77:18.79]And I have to say... I can't... Alright.
[77:22.41]Does anybody care if I talk about Spiral?
[77:26.96]Can I pause it?
[77:27.52]Can I talk about Spiral for just one second?
[77:32.48]I'm not going to spoil the whole movie.
[77:34.02]I'm just going to tell you, essentially... Can I just talk about it for one... Look, just mute the stream for like a minute.
[77:39.56]I'm going to talk about Spiral.
[77:42.38]Or the Book of Saw.
[77:44.78]Okay.
[77:46.04]Are you ready?
[77:47.22]I'm going to talk about spoilers for this movie.
[77:51.22]That movie did not need to be a Saw movie.
[77:54.12]The only reason why that's a Saw movie is because sometimes people would lean over and go, oh, just like Jigsaw.
[78:04.58]And they had a little bit of a soundtrack.
[78:08.13]That's it.
[78:11.47]Sometime, I want to say probably three times over the course of Spiral, somebody leans over and says, just like John Kramer.
[78:20.38]John Kramer did this before.
[78:22.26]Like, saw.
[78:24.16]And then they do the, where they explain the whole thing at the end of the movie.
[78:36.95]It's just like a Saw movie, but it's like a Saw fan movie.
[78:44.13]By the way, they do say gas in Saw II.
[78:48.58]I watched it pretty recently.
[78:58.76]It's a Saw-type movie.
[79:02.34]right but look I love saw so I was like one of my favorite horror franchises but you don't say this is a Jason-like movie oh yeah oh hey by the way everybody all these people at this camp yeah all these people got killed just like Jason you guys ever seen Jason like oh yeah I have seen Jason yeah just like Jason like do we have to say that in a movie that's not a Jason movie
[79:31.26]Yes, you do.
[79:32.06]It's Saw Adjacent.
[79:35.52]Friday the 13th.
[79:36.28]Yeah, but okay, but if Freddy Krueger... Alright, Freddy Krueger invades your nightmares.
[79:48.25]Alright, that's me.
[79:49.25]It's me, Freddy Krueger.
[79:50.55]And I'm gonna slash you in your dreams, right?
[79:52.97]Like, I've done that.
[79:54.15]You've heard me do it before.
[79:56.11]If there was a movie that came out where it was like
[80:00.41]Steve Stevenson.
[80:02.45]And he murders you in your dreams.
[80:05.59]And he comes for you in your nightmares.
[80:08.83]And he wears a sweatshirt.
[80:12.35]I mean, I don't... It's like, just why is Freddy Krueger not in this movie?
[80:19.63]No, no, no, no, no.
[80:21.89]Wait.
[80:22.53]Somebody's invading your dreams and killing you in your dreams?
[80:25.77]Just like Freddy Krueger.
[80:30.78]I'm not in this movie at all.
[80:33.35]I don't spend one second.
[80:35.21]Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
[80:39.25]So yeah, I'm looking forward to Saw X because I don't know.
[80:43.66]It's... I don't want to talk about Saw spoilers for the next like... Do you guys remember this?
[80:52.23]Okay.
[80:53.87]I forgot about this until very recently.
[80:56.39]Number one, I forget that there are ten Saw movies.
[81:00.05]First of all, after the third Saw movie, I don't remember a single one of those movies.
[81:07.67]What happens in Saw 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9?
[81:10.20]I don't remember them.
[81:18.64]They went from Saw 3 to, like, Saw 10.
[81:22.89]The other ones in the middle were just like, ah, I guess we'll fucking mutilate people.
[81:28.97]In the, you know, there's saw.
[81:31.27]It's not saw, but it's saw.
[81:38.06]And I remember, look, I know what happens.
[81:41.82]We're not talking all Saw spoilers.
[81:43.86]I know that after Saw 3, yes, it's, mm-hmm.
[81:48.53]And then, mm-hmm.
[81:50.21]And then it's a, mm-hmm.
[81:51.97]And then that person, mm-hmm.
[81:54.35]I know.
[81:55.19]I know the whole thing.
[81:57.07]But it's just funny to me that, like, we have ten of these movies, and now we're even making ones that are in, like, the Saw cinematic universe that have nothing to do with Saw.
[82:07.36]But it's just, like, Jigsaw-like traps.
[82:12.07]And that... That's all that translates to the other movies.
[82:19.09]Anyways, I've said what I wanted to say.
[82:24.88]That's not accurate.
[82:25.72]There is something else I wanted to say that I had as a drafted tweet.
[82:29.72]That is never going to be tweeted, but I'm going to say it.
[82:35.69]I'm convinced the loud diarrhea I've had over the last few days is what's causing all these colitis ads I'm seeing now.
[82:44.71]That's essentially what I believe.
[83:04.25]Yes, you can unmute the stream.
[83:18.92]It's too quiet.
[83:22.32]Yeah, and I don't have to explain that joke.
[83:25.80]I'm not going to explain that reference.
[83:29.24]I do that too often.
[83:30.26]You're going to have to figure it out on your own.
[83:37.07]Alright, where are we going here?
[83:41.30]Mute the stream.
[83:42.10]No, you guys can unmute.
[83:43.74]We're not talking about Saw anymore.
[83:46.72]Oh, man.
[83:47.96]I can't.
[83:48.30]No, no, no.
[83:48.58]We're done.
[83:50.00]Where am I going?
[83:53.88]They can't hear you.
[83:55.72]Well, that's too bad.
[84:02.58]Oh, wait, people were muted when I said that.
[84:04.54]Well, just people... 2,000 people just probably clicked the clip button.
[84:10.83]Like, they had, like, fucking potato chip grease all over their hands, and they, like, freaked out.
[84:14.85]They grabbed the mouse to go to the clip thing as fast as possible.
[84:22.15]And yes, I'm overgeneralizing that you're all eating, like, greasy potato chips.
[84:36.76]I know where it is.
[84:37.40]It's right there.
[84:42.20]I actually am.
[84:43.96]You know what?
[84:45.00]Me too.
[84:46.56]Me too.
[84:47.08]I gotta wipe this off.
[84:48.44]Me too.
[84:57.98]Okay, I gotta stay right near this.
[85:01.00]Whoa.
[85:04.14]OK, I think this is just.
[85:08.40]They are.
[85:14.29]Where?
[85:15.75]Where?
[85:28.04]I killed it, right?
[85:44.13]He's actually doing like really well considering.
[85:46.21]I know I thought he was going to do much worse than this.
[85:49.77]God, I just love being a Jeremiah.
[85:52.41]Don't you?
[85:52.91]Yeah.
[85:53.63]621 continue the investigation.
[86:01.61]OK.
[86:12.30]Why did you do that?
[86:12.94]There are people in there.
[86:20.75]This is gonna pop out of nowhere, right?
[86:36.49]It's got you in its sights.
[86:40.51]You're annoying.
[86:41.01]Another one of those stealth mechs.
[86:45.50]Don't let it outpace you, 621.
[86:51.48]Fine.
[86:54.72]That's fine.
[86:55.42]I got it.
[87:01.57]Yeah.
[87:02.05]How are those for tricks?
[87:07.19]Are you talking to yourself?
[87:08.73]Yeah.
[87:17.89]What do the bubbles do?
[87:28.36]They do damage and they go... Close enough.
[87:30.74]You're full of noises tonight?
[87:49.20]Just chillin'.
[88:08.65]Good thing I've got fucking liquid reflexes.
[88:19.26]WAH!
[88:57.22]Where is he?
[89:04.08]Where are you?
[89:10.15]Where is this guy?
[89:15.17]Oh, you're up there.
[89:16.09]Okay.
[89:17.79]Shit.
[89:19.11]I missed.
[89:33.95]Like, they're annoying.
[90:09.99]Where'd he go?
[90:20.39]Okay, dead.
[90:25.15]What's wrong?
[90:25.77]Oh, because I said annoying?
[90:38.47]I called the video game enemies annoying what?
[90:47.51]Charger sword.
[90:48.15]621 get down and take a closer look.
[90:54.12]Let me let me test it.
[90:57.42]Oh, that is way better than whatever the hell I was doing.
[91:11.82]How did you not know?
[91:12.50]I think it's because it said it had one swing, so I just assumed that there was not a second swing.
[91:21.01]But if you charge it, you do too.
[91:22.15]OK.
[91:25.87]Is this a boss fight?
[91:44.17]I see him.
[91:44.49]I got it.
[92:00.84]Working on it.
[92:21.54]Oh, fuck off.
[92:36.31]Ow, ow, ow.
[92:37.75]I'm dead.
[92:39.21]Okay, well.
[92:43.59]I get it now.
[92:53.66]Build might not be great here.
[92:55.64]Oh, I think I'll be OK.
[93:00.22]621 get down and take a closer look.
[93:03.73]No doubt about it is water.
[93:11.49]Alright, let's go.
[93:13.90]Must have been an underground vein.
[93:16.86]House was hiding a well all this time.
[93:19.10]Help behind you.
[93:27.19]Alright, so it's three of them.
[93:30.43]Are there small?
[93:31.09]Where's the smaller one?
[93:31.91]Alright, die.
[93:43.32]Four of them?
[93:46.11]Yep.
[93:47.41]Oh, come on.
[94:01.69]Go, please.
[94:04.49]Someone back here?
[94:08.36]Where are you?
[94:10.08]Where are you?
[94:11.08]I just saw you before.
[94:12.00]Where'd you go?
[94:12.50]Oh, right here.
[94:16.40]Nope, that's the big one.
[94:30.92]Oh, they are so high up.
[94:41.95]Oh shit.
[94:45.95]OK, just the big guy, right?
[94:50.27]No, there's another one.
[94:51.79]Where is he?
[94:53.57]There you are.
[94:53.97]OK, now it's just you.
[95:12.46]That not hit?
[95:18.50]Alright, there we go.
[95:20.00]Much, much better than last time.
[95:22.54]Seems that's the last of them.
[95:25.52]This wasn't a simple check-in after all.
[95:28.54]Head back and rest up, 621.
[95:32.19]Bubble gun helps a lot.
[95:33.31]It feels like it's pretty good.
[95:34.43]You don't have to be super accurate.
[95:37.91]It just kind of... A lot of expenses, but whatever.
[95:46.01]Have I made it?
[95:46.53]Is it time?
[95:55.68]It's time.
[95:56.36]It's actually time.
[95:57.66]Perhaps.
[95:58.10]Okay.
[96:03.26]I gotta think of only happy thoughts.
[96:04.66]What happened to 617 and the rest?
[96:07.90]Their jobs.
[96:09.08]The lucky charms.
[96:09.86]They did what it took to get us here.
[96:11.06]Marshmallows that turn into different, like, dragon coins when they hit milk.
[96:16.76]That makes me really happy.
[96:18.12]I'm good.
[96:19.12]But Gen 4 augmentation can be unstable.
[96:22.17]We need to choose our battles.
[96:24.61]How's things on your end?
[96:27.01]I found the data our friends left behind.
[96:29.13]There's something promising in the watch point.
[96:36.58]Ah, that kind of hurt.
[96:39.50]That hurt.
[96:47.16]Aren't you like 40?
[96:48.24]Yeah, I am.
[96:49.40]And I'm allowed to make funny little jokes.
[96:54.07]I see your back, 621.
[96:56.99]About the coral well that was found at Baus Arsenal No.
[97:00.13]2.
[97:01.41]That was just a drip coming from an underground vein.
[97:03.85]And it won't last long.
[97:08.52]Funny.
[97:13.32]Okay, so I am being pinged by a mod right now.
[97:21.35]And it's like, dude, go do those arena missions, please.
[97:27.23]Because the upgrades that you get there are going to make your life much easier.
[97:31.39]Alright, let's do this.
[97:36.95]I don't meet the conditions to fight this person.
[97:39.93]Why not?
[97:43.27]Oh, it's a ranking system?
[97:48.52]Oh, okay.
[97:49.06]Alright, let's go.
[97:49.54]Let's do it.
[97:49.78]Let's do it.
[97:50.12]Let's do it.
[97:50.42]Mod that mod.
[98:02.77]So these are just 1v1 challenging fights.
[98:05.36]Mad Stomp.
[98:05.72]Okay.
[98:05.86]Let's do it.
[98:31.70]Holy shit, you were so easy.
[98:34.10]You're not even going to hit me once.
[98:59.01]Anybody else coming up here to fight?
[99:04.40]Target destroyed.
[99:06.40]Concluding evaluation.
[99:08.10]Well done.
[99:10.70]Easy.
[99:13.46]Easy, easy, easy.
[99:17.10]Say that now.
[99:17.58]Let's do all these.
[99:23.21]You get the emblems too.
[99:24.09]That's funny.
[99:29.05]They're very fun.
[99:29.87]That was really fun.
[99:35.36]Wait.
[99:37.70]Do I just get 17,500 gold?
[99:41.16]I can do it as many times as I want?
[99:49.89]Like many other dosers, Rummy is utterly addicted to coral-based drugs.
[99:56.29]In his perpetually addled state, he has convinced himself that he is an invincible demigod.
[100:05.42]Even should reality intervene with a costly defeat he will forget about the setback entirely by the next day.
[100:11.73]Only death can dispel his notions of invincibility.
[100:16.70]Jeez.
[100:18.78]Okay.
[100:19.54]Blue-collar worker who was involved in the construction of the grid is now dedicated to establishing symbiosis with the coral and building a future for Rubicon free from planetary closure.
[100:31.52]Inspired by Father Dolmayan's ideals.
[100:35.69]Let's kick his ass.
[100:46.55]Lock on.
[100:47.53]I was locked on almost the whole time.
[100:49.40]I am locking on.
[100:51.36]I am locking on.
[100:52.46]Look.
[100:53.22]I just did it the whole last fight.
[100:55.65]Look.
[100:55.77]Look.
[100:56.63]Look.
[101:24.37]Come here!
[101:24.81]Aww.
[101:57.60]Maybe increase the camera turn speed.
[102:03.52]You only need to lock on once.
[102:05.82]That's true, but if they go out of my line of sight, I have to do it again, right?
[102:15.91]No.
[102:16.27]Wait, no?
[102:17.37]Oh, it just re-locks.
[102:20.75]Okay, I didn't know that.
[102:22.89]That's good to know.
[102:23.57]Thank you.
[102:23.81]Appreciate it.
[102:25.93]Lock on is a mode.
[102:26.99]Maybe camera speed.
[102:31.54]I'm okay for right this very moment.
[102:37.46]I do agree that it could become a problem.
[102:44.30]Locking on makes your aim way worse.
[102:45.96]Yeah.
[102:50.56]Seems like there is one mind to do lock on and there's one mind to never do lock on.
[102:56.29]I don't know which one of you are correct, but just do it.
[102:59.53]I'm just going to do it when I think I want to.
[103:00.83]That's a myth.
[103:11.54]Are we in the stage of FromSoftware games where nobody really knows what actually is better?
[103:16.50]I feel like it's been a week or two.
[103:17.98]People should know by now, right?
[103:22.68]Usually like a month or two will go by.
[103:25.31]I think we still need to wait a little longer to figure out who's right.
[103:34.07]I'll keep it on for now.
[103:50.31]No no no no no
[104:30.22]It's alright, I'm alive.
[104:37.63]Oh, shit!
[104:38.71]I got really gritty at the end there.
[104:40.23]I almost had it.
[104:52.06]Went for a charged melee?
[104:53.14]Yeah.
[104:56.23]Main system activating combat mode.
[105:00.47]Don't get hit.
[105:05.32]Where is he?
[105:07.24]Where do they start?
[105:47.26]Oh, shit.
[106:12.13]No, please!
[106:22.14]There we go.
[106:22.44]I did it.
[106:27.61]Alright, I have a lot of chips now.
[106:51.07]So what are the good things to do?
[106:58.57]Somebody held their hand up and they were like, hey, can I say something that you didn't do in the tutorial?
[107:04.14]And they just went to the office.
[107:06.78]They got timed out.
[107:09.88]Excuse me, teacher.
[107:10.68]I have a question.
[107:11.76]Go to the office.
[107:13.30]Oh.
[107:22.84]They did that 20 times.
[107:24.32]I finally called on that student to send you to the office.
[107:50.42]I got a lot of money.
[107:52.28]What am I spending it on?
[107:56.20]Lock-on is broken.
[107:56.98]If you move the camera stick, lock-on moves the camera for you.
[108:04.77]Oh, get the legs.
[108:05.57]Go get the legs.
[108:06.07]That's right.
[108:10.47]Ooh.
[108:12.95]Should I do the tank?
[108:16.63]Nope.
[108:17.05]We're doing that.
[108:20.47]What should I sell that I don't care about that I can just get back later?
[108:27.96]Do I care about anything on here?
[108:32.26]Okay, way more health.
[108:34.32]Way more stability.
[108:38.02]I need more energy.
[108:41.80]So... Uh-oh.
[108:52.74]Way too much.
[108:58.14]How heavy is the bubble gun?
[109:02.04]Bubble gun is pretty heavy, but I like it.
[109:04.20]I'm keeping it on.
[109:07.67]The blade is pretty heavy too.
[109:11.13]Or it doesn't use a lot of energy.
[109:17.71]This one's good.
[109:18.79]I like this one too.
[109:27.21]disable one of the shoulders.
[109:32.94]That does work.
[109:36.16]I am going into apparently a really hard, really mad inducing boss fight.
[109:44.14]Basically, lock on is useful at your weapons effective range, but if the enemy is too close or too far for your weapon, it will be less effective.
[109:52.91]You could also buy a new generator.
[109:56.70]Just need generator.
[109:57.40]It's the most important part.
[110:00.14]Let me go look and see what's even for sale.
[110:06.28]Okay.
[110:07.38]I need a big bulky one, right?
[110:14.99]This thing is 416.
[110:17.23]How much is this one?
[110:21.71]170 for the middle one.
[110:24.32]Okay, what should I sell?
[110:30.89]I can buy these all back, right?
[110:34.24]I can buy everything back.
[110:37.36]I'm not going to lose any of these.
[110:38.74]This is not okay.
[110:43.42]How much do I need?
[110:44.28]170?
[110:46.14]I want to keep bubble gun and I want to keep the blade.
[110:56.53]I like the weapons I have.
[111:02.29]okay and now this thing is much more health okay generators work by how much they have at full capacity but also how much they recharge high recharge is going to be important for this boss fight in order to boost to dodge attacks also you want me to somebody got banned you want me to uh unban them that's not happening swap out the bubble gun it's bad
[111:32.43]Let me just see.
[111:33.96]Let me see.
[111:40.16]I got a bunch of new stuff.
[111:44.78]Somebody said the chess piece is really important with this too.
[111:47.15]Alright, I'm going.
[111:49.31]OK, hold on.
[111:52.95]Where's my generator?
[111:53.79]OK, there it is.
[112:00.26]How is this one better?
[112:07.05]You don't have any back right equipment on.
[112:08.65]Is that bad?
[112:21.80]I'm still in range here.
[112:24.65]No, I won't be.
[112:25.23]Bro does not get it.
[112:29.81]I'm doing fine.
[112:32.39]I've beat all the... Look, it might not be perfect.
[112:36.01]It might not be exactly perfectly handled.
[112:39.33]But I have beaten every mission so far.
[112:41.70]And I'm going to beat this boss.
[112:42.74]And I'm not going to get angry.
[112:48.20]We're just going to go for it.
[112:49.46]I'm just going to play it.
[112:50.78]And if I lose, I can go back and, you know, re-decide what I'm going to use.
[112:58.10]I'm not going to get angry.
[112:59.96]This is it.
[113:01.48]Do we have the... Is the poll ready?
[113:03.72]So I cannot get angry.
[113:06.62]I cannot complain.
[113:08.44]I think complaining makes sense because I don't have a face camera.
[113:12.49]And it's not turning on.
[113:29.14]Don't let people decide your build for you.
[113:30.76]No, I think I'm sticking to my guns here.
[113:33.54]You're gonna get angry.
[113:34.28]We'll see.
[113:34.54]Okay, here we go.
[113:52.45]we kind of need to wait I want to so this this is currently eight million channel points saying that I will rage at this boss I want to set the ground rules again going oh or what oh my god that's fine but me saying oh my god this right
[114:22.61]That has to be fine.
[114:25.59]Like, oh, I got hit by something.
[114:27.27]Oh, what?
[114:27.97]Totally.
[114:29.29]Shit.
[114:29.93]And now I'm going to talk about how stupid this is, right?
[114:32.91]That's the difference.
[114:37.53]I didn't even buy my chips.
[114:38.48]That's right.
[114:41.88]Alright, boost kick.
[114:45.30]How do I do that?
[114:47.76]L during assault boost is boost kick.
[114:50.38]What is this one?
[114:55.44]Ooh, you can take away the missile launchers and put regular weapons there?
[114:59.29]Weight control.
[115:03.33]Unlocks the ability to sortie when AC is overburdened.
[115:10.05]I don't get that.
[115:10.59]Manual aiming.
[115:20.29]Quick turn, more armor?
[115:29.23]Assault armor is good.
[115:35.39]Second charge of assault armor.
[115:38.51]Quick turn.
[115:47.62]Fire control.
[115:49.00]Optimizes fire control.
[115:52.10]Oh, don't even.
[115:52.92]Don't show these to me.
[115:55.78]Wait.
[115:56.96]Repair kits.
[116:02.40]I feel like I should do this.
[116:04.88]Either that or maybe speed.
[116:06.00]Dynamic deflection.
[116:12.32]This is just straight up damage mitigation.
[116:16.50]This is just 3% less damage overall.
[116:26.47]I'm going to do the heal.
[116:28.55]I have one more.
[116:33.30]Alright, people saying quick turn.
[116:34.38]I'm probably not going to use it though.
[116:35.76]Alright, so I got kick, quick turn.
[116:40.69]Alright.
[116:42.07]So it's unlocked.
[116:43.17]I don't... Do I have it installed?
[116:45.31]Is it installed right now?
[116:47.56]Press L and Y at the same time.
[116:51.64]You have to equip it.
[116:53.18]You need to equip it.
[116:53.88]Okay.
[116:54.00]Okay.
[116:56.50]What does it do?
[116:57.06]Assault armor creates a pulse explosion centered on the AC.
[117:00.76]Canceling out incoming enemy fire and creating a damaging area.
[117:03.29]It's such a big, like... I just tasted a frozen grape.
[117:07.55]And it was amazing, by the way.
[117:08.65]I just tasted one.
[117:10.17]It was great.
[117:15.08]Okay, so where is it?
[117:18.30]Frozen grapes just don't ever leave your mind.
[117:23.55]Once you eat a frozen grape, it's in the back of your mind forever.
[117:28.82]It just is.
[117:29.32]I'm telling you.
[117:30.12]Trust me.
[117:34.62]Okay, expansion.
[117:37.04]There it is.
[117:37.44]I think I'm happy with this right now.
[117:46.45]Let me just see what the boss does.
[117:48.23]I'm not going to get angry.
[117:49.21]We're just going to check it out.
[117:50.97]Let's go.
[117:51.33]I'm ready.
[117:52.51]I'm ready.
[118:08.57]Stay positive, somebody said.
[118:10.65]That's why I just talked about grapes.
[118:14.55]I'm not gonna...
[118:16.67]Look, this game is hard.
[118:18.85]It's very challenging experience.
[118:20.35]FromSoftware made it.
[118:23.33]This is a boss that they made.
[118:24.57]It's it's like Malenia.
[118:26.64]It's will get upset.
[118:30.10]I am do emote only.
[118:31.62]OK, fine emote only.
[118:32.92]Because I don't want any help either.
[118:35.22]I got my bubble gun.
[118:44.83]I've got my super launcher and I've got my sword.
[118:47.71]I choose this chassis because it looks like... Bail!
[119:14.16]Okay, there are things being fired every direction.
[119:17.48]This is it.
[119:17.90]Okay, we're good.
[119:22.40]Ouch, that hurt.
[119:24.48]Ouch.
[119:25.18]I'm going to try that again.
[119:29.00]Okay, everything is good.
[119:30.21]We are doing cool.
[119:44.22]Who saw that, by the way?
[119:54.17]You didn't even see that!
[120:24.43]Easy, hold on.
[120:29.60]Go!
[120:38.96]I like floating around like this.
[120:40.12]This is great.
[120:43.87]Two repair kits remaining.
[120:55.97]That thing is huge up there.
[121:13.31]Oh, look out.
[121:25.04]got it just said to be patient everything is good we're doing fine part two where did that ac come from what happened to the patrol squad code one eight all units deploy for combat you're exposed to snipers from all quarters oh my god
[122:06.17]I'm still alive though.
[122:07.13]I just have to make it to the boss.
[122:24.35]Okay, that's it.
[122:26.99]One more.
[122:28.48]Where are you?
[122:30.24]Oops.
[122:36.00]What?
[122:36.28]I'm out of bullets?
[122:37.58]Good.
[122:55.26]I'm not bad.
[122:57.46]I'm going to get a checkpoint here.
[122:59.66]I'm fine with this.
[123:06.89]How do I reload weapons?
[123:09.01]Can you spell it out to me in emotes?
[123:15.57]How do you reload?
[123:27.91]Okay, it's Y plus the weapon button.
[123:33.42]Oh, this thing can't be reloaded.
[123:34.96]That's just how much ammo is left total.
[123:38.44]Thank you.
[123:38.70]Appreciate the help.
[123:48.57]Alright, here we go.
[123:49.13]Something's going to blow the bridge up.
[123:50.65]Watch, ready?
[123:57.27]What is that thing?
[123:57.85]Is it bubble gun?
[123:58.63]Oh.
[123:58.71]I see you're very smart.
[124:00.47]You have a bubble gun as well.
[124:28.66]Oh!
[125:52.88]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[125:56.40]He flies around.
[126:00.46]That was sloppy.
[126:01.17]It's the first time I've ever seen this guy.
[126:04.49]I'll get him.
[126:12.39]He has bubblegum.
[126:20.28]Anybody else have this problem when they play games like this?
[126:23.00]I forget what the weapon is on top left sometimes, and I go, wait a minute, I have that.
[126:34.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[126:36.45]I'm seeing a lot of yeses, though.
[126:38.21]Alright, let's go.
[126:39.95]I feel sorry for you.
[126:48.71]Whoa, whoa!
[127:00.54]Wait, I can... What's going on?
[127:03.82]Oh, I can... I thought this was death if I fell in here.
[127:12.05]Shit, I got staggered.
[127:26.63]Damn it.
[127:29.21]That's not angry.
[127:30.23]That's an exclamation.
[127:31.41]That's not angry.
[127:33.79]We already agreed that I could do that.
[127:36.61]Okay.
[127:59.03]You make fine hounds with the right training.
[128:02.52]Shane, you'll have to die here.
[128:16.78]Uh, kind of.
[128:17.87]A little.
[128:24.21]I can get munition at 50%.
[128:47.03]Hit him with that.
[128:52.13]Easy, easy, easy.
[128:52.91]Do not get hit by that.
[128:54.39]Got it.
[129:01.41]Did I do it?
[129:15.62]Did I beat him?
[129:16.02]That I do.
[129:16.36]Okay.
[129:16.48]I feel very happy right now.
[129:18.28]I'm not angry or anything.
[129:20.86]Things are going very well.
[129:22.72]I thought that just killed me.
[129:23.68]That would have been really sad.
[129:50.03]Am I going the wrong way?
[129:52.00]Oh.
[129:55.96]I was reading chat.
[129:56.82]I thought I did it.
[129:57.44]I was looking for all the PogChamps.
[130:01.43]Wait, can I take like a chip out of this?
[130:04.75]No.
[130:15.16]Ah, that was just part one.
[130:16.54]I see.
[130:22.26]He got through part one.
[130:24.94]But how will he do it part two?
[130:26.38]That's the scary part.
[130:33.41]Here's the supply.
[130:45.41]Alright, let's go.
[130:46.89]What is it?
[130:48.06]It's probably a giant snake.
[131:00.47]Destroy the device in the center.
[131:19.94]How do I do that?
[131:37.69]That was really loud.
[131:40.89]That was super loud.
[131:42.27]Uh oh.
[131:50.41]Here comes the real boss.
[131:59.01]The ground's gonna be lava.
[132:14.56]Oh.
[132:19.54]I probably have to do this level in complete darkness, which is why everyone thinks it's hard.
[132:23.50]Please, you must wake up.
[132:43.42]Wake up.
[132:45.84]RT!
[132:47.18]Thanks, RT, for the raid.
[132:49.12]Welcome, everybody.
[132:54.05]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[132:55.97]We're playing Armored Core 6.
[132:58.53]I've not died once, so it's actually pretty interesting.
[133:03.89]Welcome to the gamer zone.
[133:08.48]Oh, it's emote only.
[133:09.22]They can't even talk.
[133:11.32]Well, thank you nonetheless.
[133:14.29]Vital signs confirmed.
[133:19.29]Disabling autopilot.
[133:21.03]Establishing comms link with him.
[133:23.17]Yeah, it's weird.
[133:23.51]People are saying, dude, this is so hard.
[133:25.03]So I've been playing this game with my feet the whole time.
[133:27.83]Like, it's been going pretty well.
[133:30.70]It's kind of hard, I guess, when you play like that.
[133:35.06]Uh-oh.
[133:35.44]Alright, here we go.
[134:00.05]Holy shit, those things are homing missiles!
[134:21.83]How could I have missed?
[134:26.53]Oh!
[134:55.39]Picking up a massive heat signature.
[134:57.51]Evasive action report.
[135:03.72]Repeat at 50%.
[135:10.93]No repair kits remaining.
[135:26.46]This thing out of bullets?
[135:39.94]He's almost empty.
[135:49.72]OK, so that was interesting.
[135:52.49]So the big problem is trying to dodge those.
[135:55.51]I didn't know they were homing missiles, but now I do.
[135:57.51]I know they home.
[135:59.31]And I think you just have to outrun them.
[136:05.92]Main system, reactivating combat mode.
[136:12.26]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[136:15.04]It's an autonomous PCA craft, Bounteous.
[136:19.82]I got an oh here we go Here we here we go
[136:57.96]Ow!
[136:59.36]My goodness.
[137:03.28]That hurts a lot.
[137:16.74]I didn't get hit by any that time.
[137:47.98]Whoa!
[137:51.66]Whoa, that hurt.
[137:53.44]What was that move?
[137:54.66]Question.
[138:01.09]Okay.
[138:01.61]50%.
[138:01.65]That's not bad.
[138:03.67]Happy hob with a raid, too.
[138:04.83]Two big raids back-to-back.
[138:05.89]Thanks, guys.
[138:09.17]Appreciate it.
[138:10.95]I'm thinking that I'm trying again.
[138:15.25]Welcome all Raiders.
[138:18.03]I got to get this down.
[138:18.92]It's an autonomous PCA craft.
[138:29.43]You'll have to break its pulse armor to inflict meaningful damage.
[138:39.89]Crap.
[138:41.99]You get hit once here, it hurts a lot.
[138:46.81]That massive dose of coral nearly killed you.
[139:03.44]Please, you have to focus on one of us.
[139:18.56]Alright, I need shield breakers.
[139:20.36]This ain't cutting it.
[139:47.05]Ow!
[139:50.95]Yeah, I need anti-shield and I need explosives.
[139:56.37]Yeah, we're changing it up.
[139:57.67]Oops.
[140:02.90]I'm not angry.
[140:03.90]I'm just a little surprised at what just happened.
[140:07.04]Everything is okay.
[140:08.90]I'm just a little surprised.
[140:12.16]Oops.
[140:12.51]Oops.
[140:17.61]I just wanted to get back out here as fast as I could because I wanted to change this stuff very quickly.
[140:21.91]Alright, I need anti-shield.
[140:31.01]I'm good.
[140:31.75]I'm good.
[140:32.21]I just was surprised that that's what I just did.
[140:37.55]So what do I need?
[140:40.03]I need shield impact.
[140:44.03]There it is, right?
[140:46.34]alright impact drop that shield and that no I'm seeing a lot of nay nay nay nay no no no don't do this that's not isn't that what that means
[141:21.36]because people were saying the bubble gun is really good against the shields but I don't use it that effectively I always burn it out let me take a look hold on impact what is the most impact probably some of these
[141:52.92]Hmm.
[141:55.70]There's way too many yeas and nays here.
[141:57.46]I'm just going to do the thing I just did.
[141:59.17]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[142:07.15]I have to stand still for this, but I'll try it.
[142:12.05]What do I want on the other hand?
[142:13.57]The sword is really good, though.
[142:15.40]I love the sword of this so much.
[142:17.74]Grenade launcher, maybe?
[142:18.42]Just do grenade, grenade.
[142:20.14]Grenade.
[142:22.29]This is bazooka and this is grenade launcher.
[142:24.26]What does this one do?
[142:26.58]Yeah, yeah, fuck it.
[142:27.56]We're doing this one too.
[142:40.94]Alright, that's what we're going for.
[142:42.02]It might be dumb, but I'm very surprised at what I just did.
[142:50.02]And that's my own fault.
[142:54.10]Nobody else's fault but mine.
[142:59.06]I'm ready.
[143:06.33]Main system activating countdown.
[143:09.49]I got two big missile launchers.
[143:13.77]I got two missile launchers now.
[143:19.66]It's just one AC.
[143:23.52]Who are they with?
[143:26.12]Way better.
[143:27.58]Way better.
[143:29.22]I mean like a hundred times better.
[143:30.17]I can't get through to HQ.
[143:36.14]Oh, I ran out of juice.
[143:38.77]Did I miss?
[144:09.06]Come on, do it.
[144:14.14]Okay.
[144:14.94]Confirmed.
[144:15.72]Enemy squad destroyed.
[144:17.24]Move on to the next area.
[144:19.92]I do have to fight that... I have to fight that guy again, don't I?
[144:29.85]Where did that AC come from?
[144:31.81]What happened to the patrol squad?
[144:34.49]Code 1A.
[144:35.45]All units deploy for combat.
[144:38.30]Oh.
[144:38.46]Ow.
[144:38.76]Die.
[144:38.86]Got it.
[145:08.77]Where?
[145:14.65]Okay.
[145:21.78]We are good.
[145:22.86]Fight the boss.
[145:34.72]Well, the mini boss.
[145:35.43]Let me get it right.
[145:43.58]I'm going to lose here, right?
[145:44.78]It's okay to lose her.
[145:48.66]This is the kick.
[145:52.60]First time I've seen that.
[145:56.00]Alright, let's see if I... Maybe I can do it first try with half health.
[146:00.28]One, two.
[146:17.12]I almost got it.
[146:17.90]Damn it.
[146:18.56]Right shoulder ammunition at 50%.
[146:44.20]He's a little fast.
[146:46.35]I wasn't planning on beating him this time anyways.
[146:48.09]I had half health.
[147:07.96]These things are slow.
[147:09.72]I just need to get to the checkpoint for the boss.
[147:13.39]Alright, three heals.
[147:14.79]I'm ready.
[147:15.21]Let's go.
[147:15.69]Alright, I gotta get above you.
[147:19.25]You're so quick.
[147:44.31]He's an independent mercenary who survived first gen augmentation.
[147:49.38]Don't think twice, 621.
[147:51.56]Shit, I'm never going to hit this guy.
[147:53.72]I am never going to hit this guy.
[147:56.06]He's too fast.
[147:57.10]Shit.
[148:00.56]One good hit and this guy is dead.
[148:05.14]Two repair kits remaining.
[148:19.13]That's alright.
[148:19.67]Alright, we're okay.
[148:36.54]Oh, come on.
[148:37.16]That didn't hit.
[148:41.32]I haven't even heard him.
[148:46.01]Ooh, that was good.
[149:17.02]Point blank.
[149:17.56]I'm right in the face.
[149:18.24]Come on.
[149:20.93]I got him.
[149:30.28]I got him.
[149:30.64]I got him.
[149:30.88]I got him.
[149:31.86]That hurt a lot.
[149:44.85]Stop bumping into me.
[149:46.28]He's bumping into me.
[149:47.24]He just keeps... He keeps just driving into me.
[149:59.04]No!
[150:09.05]Alright, this is a bad loadout against this guy.
[150:14.45]It takes too long to shoot this guy.
[150:16.23]Put this load out.
[150:23.91]I can do it.
[150:24.61]I can do it.
[150:24.95]I can do it.
[150:25.59]Look how close I just got it.
[150:26.79]I'm good.
[150:28.89]Yes, let them out of emote only.
[150:30.33]I want to see their anger.
[150:32.04]I want to feel it.
[150:46.39]I'm I'm I'm just chilling I'm doing fine you may have survived a little longer alright my gun was just in his body
[151:13.45]Somebody said boost kick.
[151:28.14]I just tried it.
[151:30.26]Probably does a lot of damage.
[151:31.68]Pretty go.
[151:49.80]Boost kick scales with weight.
[151:52.98]Oh, shit.
[151:58.21]Oh, the bubble ward.
[151:59.39]That's a good idea.
[152:00.95]Somebody shoot somebody at him.
[152:06.37]I didn't have any bullets left.
[152:07.71]Shit.
[152:08.61]Okay.
[152:12.19]This is not going to work.
[152:15.13]I'm just understanding that right now.
[152:19.06]It's way too fast to use these weapons.
[152:21.28]Okay, so here's what we're going to do.
[152:25.25]You don't need to quit.
[152:28.15]Oh.
[152:29.55]It's okay.
[152:30.17]It means I have to do it again.
[152:36.85]What are the problems?
[152:38.31]Okay, the problems are... They're too slow.
[152:44.59]So... Honestly, I think this was fine.
[152:54.45]I think the bubble gun was actually doing pretty good.
[152:57.16]I mean, I beat him with the bubble gun.
[152:58.38]I can't beat him with these two.
[152:59.36]I'm going to keep it on.
[153:05.12]I need just something to like... Do double bubble?
[153:15.25]I think you might be onto something.
[153:22.32]I'm going to try it.
[153:24.06]I'm going double bubble.
[153:26.51]Just need to buy the other one, right?
[153:30.85]Yeah.
[153:31.55]Alright, we're going to go double bubble.
[153:32.55]90,000.
[153:32.57]I don't need this.
[153:51.51]That one's on.
[153:53.07]Alright, double bubble.
[154:00.19]This is fine.
[154:01.20]It can stay on.
[154:01.74]Alright, what about this stuff?
[154:04.24]I feel like I need to go to like Armored Core school for three weeks.
[154:12.59]So I can get my doctorate in Armored Core.
[154:21.25]I'm kind of too heavy.
[154:27.37]I think this is good.
[154:28.11]I mean, I kind of have... Wait.
[154:43.62]Hmm.
[154:43.70]Hmm.
[154:47.41]I mean, this thing that you are so, so much lighter.
[154:51.43]But obviously all that capacity is gone and I want the capacity.
[154:54.97]Apparently too heavy though.
[155:01.25]How do I drop some weight?
[155:03.11]Get rid of one of these?
[155:05.27]No, I have a better idea.
[155:08.05]I'm changing my entire play style.
[155:11.65]Everything is changing right now.
[155:21.97]Here's what I'm going to do.
[155:25.27]We're doing double sword.
[155:26.85]I'm doing sword on left, sword on right.
[155:29.48]And then big missiles in the back.
[155:36.80]That's not possible.
[155:38.06]Oh, that can't be done.
[155:39.10]That can't be done?
[155:39.98]Okay, well, I'm going to do... That can't be done.
[155:44.78]Should I just stick with what I know?
[155:52.75]You know what?
[155:55.15]I feel like this thing is good.
[156:00.65]Get the weapon bay.
[156:01.41]I don't have enough.
[156:07.54]And now I'm going to do this.
[156:16.12]I'm going to try this.
[156:18.16]I want to be able to move around.
[156:21.80]Let's try that.
[156:22.50]I have to start the mission over again.
[156:35.07]Alright, so do not quit the mission.
[156:38.21]Just die, go to continue, and the continue screen has...
[156:44.58]Stop touching the camera stick when locked on.
[156:47.00]Yeah, but you are talking about like 30 years of me following, like tracking with the right stick.
[156:52.68]Don't worry.
[156:53.70]Not even the PCA would anticipate it.
[156:56.82]It takes a while to get used to that.
[156:57.94]Get in there and get to work.
[157:04.98]See how this is going.
[157:05.72]Main system activating combat mode.
[157:08.44]Alright, so now that's good.
[157:13.46]Handle it.
[157:18.40]See how this works now.
[157:23.16]Little bit faster.
[157:25.04]Alright.
[157:31.91]Get rid of that thing.
[157:33.41]Did I hit it?
[157:33.85]Okay.
[157:40.99]I forgot what my entire loadout was.
[157:42.51]I was just shooting as if I had the grenade launcher on still.
[157:53.73]Okay, left trigger is sword.
[157:59.45]Can I dodge into that?
[158:03.63]My goodness.
[158:09.64]Right trigger is just regular shoot gun.
[158:12.94]Left trigger is sword.
[158:17.42]No repair kits remaining.
[158:30.83]okay uh that was very sloppy but sorry confirmed enemy squad destroyed move on to the next area now fighting this guy will be a lot better I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna lose but it's fine where did that az come from what happened to the patrol squad
[158:58.40]Boost.
[158:58.64]Mm-hmm.
[159:38.79]Let's go.
[159:38.97]You're talking like you're reassuring a kid in a storm.
[160:00.93]like those loud sounds it's thunder hey watch this ready flash one two three that means it's four miles away feeling yeah after you see the flash count one Mississippi tube and then you'll you'll figure it out lightning's not scary now is it just I'm gonna you may have survived a little
[160:29.31]I mean, I planned on dying here, so it's OK.
[160:39.20]I want to go in fresh, just kill me.
[160:48.38]I wanted to get killed right there.
[160:51.16]I've been playing for three hours.
[160:52.47]I thought it's been like 40 minutes.
[160:57.99]Time really flies when you hate fucking everything possible about a game and can't stand playing it.
[161:02.27]You're only playing it for views.
[161:03.47]Wow.
[161:03.71]I'm kidding.
[161:04.11]Stop.
[161:04.43]I'm kidding.
[161:06.26]That was very clearly a joke.
[161:07.96]Here we go.
[161:08.50]Okay.
[161:25.74]Where am I?
[162:02.49]Double.
[162:06.38]That didn't even hurt him at all.
[162:08.68]How?
[162:44.59]Alright, now we're gonna fight the real boss.
[162:48.19]Real boss.
[162:50.75]I'm probably gonna die in this one too.
[162:52.03]Now we're cooking.
[163:17.36]There's the supply.
[163:25.20]Don't quit.
[163:25.76]Don't quit.
[163:26.18]I won't quit.
[163:26.60]I won't.
[163:26.82]I won't.
[163:27.84]I'll make sure I get it right.
[163:32.86]I know the last time I did that, at least a few of you had a bunch of papers on your desk and you just threw them in the air.
[163:39.84]I know.
[163:41.60]You were taking notes on my performance and it was like, alright, he did that like three times.
[163:45.10]Whatever, you know, just throw them up in the air.
[163:52.36]Alright, here we go.
[163:53.46]I'm going to try it with this.
[164:00.35]Should be good.
[164:01.17]Did it.
[164:23.54]You need to believe in the lock.
[164:24.72]Don't touch the right stick.
[164:25.70]Believe in the lock.
[164:27.92]I know, but I can't.
[164:30.82]I'm trying.
[164:31.74]I promise I'm trying.
[164:36.18]No cam means you can rage in silence.
[164:38.45]I have actually not.
[164:42.19]You know, you guys talk this up so much.
[164:44.49]This is like a filter.
[164:48.51]I don't think you guys should have said anything.
[164:52.33]Because I probably would have been like what's going on here now.
[165:03.56]I know this one's a hard one.
[165:06.38]Picking up a massive heat signature.
[165:14.75]I'm just trying to watch the.
[165:21.47]Missiles coming in.
[165:24.66]Alright, I'm locked on right now.
[165:27.70]I'm not going to hit any of the right stick or anything.
[165:33.26]This is going way, way worse than last time.
[166:03.73]I'm already out of boost
[166:31.53]Alright, here come the missiles.
[166:58.17]Oh, I'm dead.
[166:59.19]Okay, that's 50%.
[167:03.47]Okay.
[167:08.39]Okay.
[167:12.62]Stop touching the right stick.
[167:14.86]I... That is a... That's a large ask.
[167:20.02]It really is.
[167:20.84]It's almost making it harder for me.
[167:25.94]Two repair kits remaining.
[167:39.48]I mean, I'm not touching the right stick.
[167:41.02]It's weird to not have my thumb on that, though.
[167:43.80]But I'm going to keep it up.
[168:02.44]Did that hurt?
[168:02.84]I think that kind of hurt.
[168:12.23]Ouch.
[168:28.09]Taking so much damage.
[168:45.27]Sometimes I feel like this game's like a war of attrition that I will always lose.
[169:01.60]Better than last time.
[169:02.34]Oh, that happens when?
[169:07.38]Okay.
[169:11.78]We're at 50% again.
[169:21.37]Different sword.
[169:22.17]Okay.
[169:28.75]What do I got in my hand right now?
[169:30.15]Let's go bubble.
[169:32.23]And then... This one's eight.
[169:38.53]I'll do this one.
[169:41.47]I'm alright now.
[169:42.61]Alright, let's go for it.
[169:43.41]Here we go.
[169:43.73]Main system.
[169:44.45]Reactivating combat mode.
[169:54.71]Oh OK.
[169:57.82]Bubble.
[170:11.65]I I was getting better.
[170:24.74]Didn't want to do that, but I sorry Oh shit
[171:11.65]I'm clear.
[171:11.97]I'm clear.
[171:12.25]I'm clear.
[171:12.53]I'm clear.
[171:13.07]Am I?
[171:14.19]That hurt.
[171:17.45]Whoa.
[171:18.81]Oh, that was a big move.
[171:23.17]What is this new move?
[171:24.93]Alright.
[171:25.13]You have a gigantic sword now.
[171:28.31]Flamethrower.
[171:34.66]Okay.
[171:35.00]Alright.
[171:35.40]Alright.
[171:35.74]It's not even a big deal.
[171:44.32]That hurts.
[171:44.92]Come here, come here, come here.
[171:57.16]Okay.
[171:59.60]So, phase two now has a gigantic fire sword.
[172:05.53]Good to know.
[172:10.17]Okay.
[172:10.35]Okay.
[172:24.51]It's an autonomous PCA craft.
[172:26.41]Just keep the pressure up.
[172:27.67]No matter what.
[172:28.89]Only pressure. Only pressure.
[172:30.14]Pressure. Pressure.

[172:31.82]Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Pressure.
[173:42.50]Shoot!

[173:45.80]We're good.
[173:50.85]What the heck?
[173:51.51]The waves are intensifying.
[174:03.68]Raven, get clear.

[174:11.75]I forgot!
[174:13.71]Oh my god, I'm just driving into it.

[174:16.05]I forgot everything.
[174:16.71]It was so clean.
[174:17.29]That first wave was so clean too.
[174:18.45]And I forgot everything.
[174:20.89]I was so locked in trying to like fight that I forgot of the other moves.
[174:36.18]Ooh, that's fire!
[174:50.52]The enemy can't take much more.
[175:16.40]I forgot he did those moves.
[175:18.70]It's okay.
[175:19.04]It's alright.
[175:19.41]It's alright.
[175:19.83]It's fine.
[175:20.11]It's fine.
[175:20.55]It's fine.
[175:20.91]It's fine.

[175:24.33]I got it.
[175:26.63]I got it.
[175:26.93]It's just phase two happened and I took two full health bars and damage because I stood there and went, what is, what is this move?
[175:42.31]Easy.
[175:42.69]Easy.
[175:44.09]Main system, deactivating combat mode.
[175:53.07]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[175:56.23]It's an autonomous PCA craft.
[175:57.93]Am I locked on?
[175:58.75]You'll have to break its pulse armor to inflict meaningful damage.
[176:02.35]Pulse armor down.
[176:08.11]Now's your chance, Raven.
[176:38.61]I forgot the moves again.
[176:40.45]I forgot them again, guys.
[176:43.80]I'm way too locked in.
[177:24.28]I didn't mean to do that.
[177:25.70]I forgot the moves again, by the way.
[177:27.12]Like... If I just... Honestly, I need to go ride it on a fucking chalkboard.
[177:34.11]And I'll be fine.
[177:35.19]Like a thousand times.
[178:05.70]Hey!
[178:07.32]Oh my goodness.
[178:07.88]Okay, we're fine.

[178:16.77]Phase two, the swing happens.
[178:18.55]Don't just keep playing like it's gonna just be phase one.
[178:22.61]Don't get locked in.
[178:23.85]Phase two, we're good.
[178:25.45]Everything is fine.
[178:26.60]Everything is just completely good.
[178:28.46]We're good.

[178:35.71]Pull sounder down.
[178:41.88]Now's your chance, Raven.
[178:43.66]I've taken your comms link offline for now.
[178:47.44]That massive dose of coral nearly killed you.
[178:50.24]Please... ...you have to focus on winning this.
[178:52.90]The enemy has taken heavy damage.
[178:57.81]Keep it up, Raven.
[179:34.22]Couldn't back up.
[179:34.76]I couldn't back up.
[179:35.34]I couldn't back up.
[179:35.86]I was staggered I Got it.
[179:42.00]I alright.
[179:43.80]I am so confident that I'm gonna beat this But it's my confidence.
[179:48.02]That's causing a huge problem.
[179:53.51]I Have to be not confident anymore, right like I have to be like, oh, it's not gonna happen I don't think it's gonna happen
[180:01.61]Alright, I got it this time.
[180:06.50]Here we go.
[180:08.02]Oh, shit.
[180:22.83]That's not good.
[180:24.97]That was a bad start.
[180:29.43]Okay.
[180:46.37]Oh, I took too much damage there.
[180:47.57]Way too much.
[180:48.11]Do you have a sword in phase one too?
[180:55.79]I didn't know that.
[181:07.10]I wonder what the actual way to avoid that is.
[181:15.18]There's got to be like a... Oh, it's the meta way.
[181:18.39]There has to be some way to do it.
[181:19.73]I have no idea what it is though. 50%.
[181:43.25]Oh, way too much damage.
[181:46.69]Ah, this one's not.
[181:47.27]This one doesn't count.
[181:48.03]Yeah, this one doesn't count.
[181:52.93]This one doesn't count.
[182:20.11]This one doesn't count.
[182:20.59]Oh, I tried to turn this like keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.
[182:34.12]It's just an observation.
[182:38.10]Shoot.
[182:39.14]Oh, oh, oh, peanut butter.
[182:40.92]Main system reactivating combat mode.
[182:55.02]Alright, pull back, pull back, pull back.
[183:07.16]Two repair kits remaining.
[183:23.22]I thought it was me that did that to you, but it was you that did that to me.
[183:30.60]Why already?
[183:31.64]What?
[183:32.92]Oh my God, I'm kicking his ass.
[183:35.00]I didn't realize how much I was kicking his ass.
[183:43.00]No repair kits remaining.
[183:50.31]I didn't realize this one was I was just pressing random buttons.
[183:54.73]I thought this one was a just like I'm not going to do it, but whatever.
[184:16.03]You know, if I had like 10% more patience, I would be doing a lot better.
[184:20.22]I'm sorry, Raven.
[184:28.48]Okay.
[184:28.58]I'm going to go in with this 10% more patience.
[184:33.81]Let's try that.
[184:34.27]Main system, reactivating combat mode.
[184:43.05]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[184:45.36]It's an autonomous PCA craft.
[184:48.60]Is the character still in the game?
[184:49.82]Oh, okay.
[184:50.54]I was like, what the fuck is happening?
[184:52.12]Two repair kits.
[184:52.54]Hold on a minute.
[185:00.52]Now's your chance, Raven.
[185:10.12]I've taken your cone slug offline for now.
[185:13.08]Shit.
[185:54.73]You can tell when it doesn't work.
[186:10.67]Oh, I couldn't even see it on the screen.
[186:11.95]Does that hurt kind of?
[186:20.66]Yeah.
[186:22.55]That would've been great.
[186:32.56]Alright, patience.
[186:42.89]Patience.
[186:43.39]Have it.
[186:44.31]Please.
[186:53.02]I accidentally just pressed up on the D-pad.
[186:56.96]I don't even know how that happened, but I know it did.
[186:58.85]I didn't mean to press that.
[187:03.75]That's why I'm going to take this one as a loss.
[187:17.70]Picking up a massive heat signature.
[187:19.96]Evasive action, Raven.
[187:24.82]okay um so this is very very very difficult but it's not impossible
[187:54.29]I'm not even sure difficult is the... I don't think it's even necessarily that's difficult.
[188:00.17]It's that... You are... You're stepping on the gas.
[188:04.62]Your foot is all the way to the bottom of the car.
[188:07.78]And it doesn't stop until the mission ends.
[188:10.44]I think you just... You have to be on point the whole... You gotta be on point the whole time.
[188:22.92]We're doing just fine.
[188:25.84]Okay.
[188:31.74]There it is.
[188:36.53]Not bad.
[188:37.99]Pretty good start.

[189:23.57]Swinging and coming.
[189:27.21]Underneath it.
[189:27.73]That's exactly what I wanted to do.
[189:33.01]How many swings do you have?
[189:34.19]How many times does he swing?
[189:41.79]Oh boy, I'm out of dashes.
[189:43.57]Oh, you're doing way too many of those in a row.
[189:59.54]Back it up.
[189:59.84]Back it up.
[190:00.16]Back it up.
[190:00.46]Back it up.
[190:12.47]No.
[190:12.85]What happened?
[190:14.79]What happened?
[190:15.53]I got hit by like a hundred missiles.
[190:22.86]What the hell?
[190:23.70]Oh.
[190:28.83]Main system, deactivating combat mode.
[190:34.86]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[190:37.72]It's an autonomous PCA craft, Baltheus.
[190:42.02]You'll have to break its pulse armor until it's at me.
[190:44.76]Pulse armor down.
[190:47.21]Now for a chance rave.
[190:51.21]Alright, hit him.
[190:53.63]I've taken your pulse armor offline for now.
[190:56.85]That massive dose of coral
[191:00.61]I wish the lock-on circle was red.
[191:02.69]Sometimes it's hard to tell if I'm even locked on.
[191:07.35]Can I change that in the options?
[191:11.04]Can I change that?
[191:15.92]I wish I could make it red.
[191:22.36]I don't know how you reliably dodge those.
[191:25.38]There's just a hundred million of them.
[191:29.26]That one didn't count.
[191:32.05]Main system, reactivating combat mode.

[192:03.98]Okay.
[192:08.46]Should I stay back from the missiles maybe?
[192:10.52]I don't know.
[192:12.22]They just spam.
[192:15.66]I guess maybe just go... No?
[192:19.12]How are you supposed to dodge that?
[192:28.51]Okay.
[192:36.07]Okay.
[192:38.87]Just assault, boost, pass.
[192:40.19]Aren't they homing though?
[192:40.99]Yeah, they're like, they're like on me.
[192:44.29]Alright.
[192:44.77]I had him.
[192:45.27]I had him beat.
[192:46.30]I just got to get back on it.
[192:47.72]Let's go.
[192:48.42]Start over.
[192:56.70]Does that kind of work?
[193:00.52]I use it so much.
[193:01.28]But look, and it's happening again.
[193:03.12]I don't have any more boost.
[193:04.76]No, I'm doing it my way.

[193:19.49]You'll have to break its place on it.
[193:33.74]Why?
[193:33.84]Can I just outrun it?
[193:34.70]Maybe.
[193:35.58]Maybe.
[193:50.35]I just hit every button on my... I hit Y, X, A, and V at the exact same time.
[194:07.46]I feel like I'm in a crashing plane.
[194:11.78]Is that anger?
[194:13.90]What?
[194:14.30]No!
[194:32.67]That was not anger.
[194:33.70]That was me making a joke.
[194:35.94]That was a joke.
[194:36.72]That was like a... I did funny noises.
[194:38.94]That's not anger.
[194:39.70]That's funny sound effects.
[194:42.66]Yeah, you cannot be angry and make funny sound effects.
[194:44.70]That's not how it works.
[194:53.47]I got him down to like 1%.
[194:54.41]I'm gonna... Okay, time to be quiet.
[194:55.99]Let's go.
[194:56.67]This is the one right here.

[195:10.98]It's under down.
[195:16.94]Now's your chance, Raven.
[195:20.17]I've taken your coast like offline for now.
[195:25.69]That massive piece of coral nearly killed you.
[195:49.81]What hit me?
[195:51.30]I'm so confused.
[196:06.91]The waves are intensifying.
[196:27.27]Raven, get clear.
[196:27.83]If I can't emanate that, it hurts a percent.
[197:17.36]Do that, do that move quick!
[197:41.75]Oh my goodness.
[197:44.20]I can't believe I didn't get killed.
[197:50.42]Come on.
[197:53.74]Oh my goodness.
[197:54.92]You gotta be kidding me.
[197:57.48]Oh, it's okay.
[197:58.52]I'm not even mad about it.
[198:00.22]I can't believe it.
[198:02.36]I can't believe it.
[198:06.13]God dang it.
[198:12.49]Darn it.
[198:13.33]Oh, darn it.
[198:14.51]That's a big darn it right there.
[198:16.17]That was one HP.
[198:17.47]That's such a huge darn it.
[198:21.88]That is like a... Oh, gosh.
[198:24.34]Dang it.
[198:26.78]Oh.
[198:31.91]Can't even.
[198:33.29]It's alright.
[198:38.29]Hey, we're good.
[198:39.25]Let's go.
[198:40.61]I'll do it again.
[198:41.37]I'll do it again right now.
[198:49.96]I'll do it again right now.
[198:51.46]You have to focus on one of us.
[199:15.37]Recharge, recharge, recharge, recharge.
[199:17.81]Why can't I recharge?
[199:39.29]Damn it.
[199:43.93]I have to restart.
[199:53.03]Okay, now I'm just I I eat the energy one hit I can't believe it Hey
[200:18.80]the enemy craft.
[200:19.22]It's an autonomous PCA craft.
[200:21.26]Bounteous.
[200:23.18]You'll have to break its pulse armor to inflict meaningful damage.
[200:26.58]Oh, get in there.
[200:27.46]What?
[200:27.58]Pulse armor down.
[200:35.25]That's your chance, Raven.
[200:38.95]That doesn't count.
[200:39.77]Main system reactivating combat mode.
[200:44.65]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[200:47.48]Here we go.
[200:50.28]More of this bullshit.
[200:58.83]Good start.
[201:03.48]I can't believe I didn't hit that.
[201:06.60]I wish I knew what happened there.
[201:08.60]I was locked on.
[201:09.28]It just didn't stay locked on.
[201:13.68]That's a complaint.
[201:14.30]I lose.
[201:15.06]No, I'm complaining now.
[201:17.08]That's actually a complaint.
[201:19.90]I didn't press the right stick.
[201:21.28]I didn't trip the lock on off.
[201:22.58]I'm complaining.
[201:23.16]It's over.
[201:23.44]Yeah, this is a complaint.
[201:34.05]I wouldn't necessarily say I'm angry.
[201:35.67]I would say I'm complaining.
[201:36.89]Okay.
[201:46.98]I'm going to put it this weapon is is ass against this enemy because yeah, give me a different.
[201:54.05]How do I do it again?
[201:56.49]How do I put a different weapon on?
[201:59.85]This bubble weapon is cool, but like how are you ever going to attack somebody like he just flies around the whole map and at the range is like medium range.
[202:06.87]Yeah, it's ass.
[202:10.04]Hey, I didn't get filtered yet.
[202:12.50]The boss had 1 HP 10 minutes ago.
[202:14.78]Don't forget that.
[202:16.65]I ain't kidding.
[202:17.29]No.
[202:17.93]What is this bullshit?
[202:29.41]You take one of those, it's half of your entire health pool.
[202:31.03]Main system, reactivating combat mode.
[202:38.67]I've looked into the enemy craft it's an autonomous pca craft you have to break its pulse armor to inflict meaningful damage picking up a massive heat signature
[203:07.94]My eyes are itching.
[203:23.07]Yeah, this, look at this, okay, this bubble gun, you can shoot it for like a one second before it overheats.
[203:29.21]This thing fucking stinks.
[203:34.38]You go... Overheated.
[203:37.04]Oh my god, this thing sucks.
[203:38.33]Asshole.
[203:45.49]Okay, come on.
[204:30.75]Shit!
[204:36.19]That, how did that even hit me?
[204:37.61]I dodged it perfectly.
[204:46.60]Hmm.
[205:01.30]Still not good.
[205:02.90]I have like no health.
[205:03.68]Alright, you know what?
[205:18.29]Kill me because I want to take this bubble gun off.
[205:21.71]One, two.
[205:23.01]You shoot this thing for two seconds and it overheats.
[205:27.72]In the middle of a giant fight where there's just shit screaming at you and like missiles are shooting you from every single direction from every angle, it's hard to look at that tiny little bar to see if it's red.
[205:41.54]I'm sorry.
[205:42.40]It just is.
[205:47.63]Get this thing the fuck out of here.
[205:48.99]Sell it.
[205:52.57]Oh shit, I don't have anything.
[205:54.69]Is this even better?
[206:02.50]Alright, no more complaining.
[206:03.16]Let's go.
[206:05.90]I'm trying to be so patient.
[206:15.89]There's just shit everywhere.
[206:53.88]Aww, really?
[206:55.34]That's unfortunate.
[207:06.68]I need to get more heals probably.
[207:08.16]I feel like that's holding me back too.
[207:17.26]I already have one health.
[207:18.36]If you don't get to phase two without two, it's over.
[207:34.85]Okay, let's pull back.
[207:41.15]You'll have to break its pulse armor to inflict meaningful damage.
[207:45.59]My goodness.

[207:57.15]Frontiers.
[208:12.27]Maybe you just... I'm just going to ski.
[208:13.89]I'm not even going to attack like that.
[208:16.07]Just drive.
[208:16.69]Does this work?
[208:18.91]Kind of.
[208:21.40]Oh, no, it does not.
[208:22.60]Oh, no, it does not.
[208:23.34]Okay.
[208:33.03]Okay.
[208:40.00]You'll have to break its pulse armor to inflict meaningful damage.
[208:42.22]Okay.
[208:42.32]Pulse armor down.
[208:42.88]Now's your chance, Raven.
[208:50.29]Good start.
[208:50.87]Very good start.
[208:59.51]Exceptional start.
[209:00.35]Please, you'll have to focus on one of us.
[209:26.91]oh okay ski ski ski alright back up back up back up back up not bad not bad
[209:39.91]Raiden, get clear.
[209:42.27]Two repair kits remaining.
[209:44.46]Pick up the swing.
[209:45.18]Yep.
[209:56.97]Right-hand ammunition at 50%.
[210:15.08]What hit me?
[210:15.42]What hit me?
[210:15.78]What hit me?
[210:16.12]What hit me?
[210:40.07]The enemy can't take much more.
[210:45.13]Right shoulder ammunition at 30%.
[211:08.52]Whoa!
[211:10.22]I fucking lose.
[211:16.66]Oh, no.
[211:17.24]Oh, no.
[211:20.95]It just got such an insane cone.
[211:24.03]It's like, it's like, it's like 300 degrees in front of this motherfucker.
[211:27.25]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[211:28.27]It's an autonomous PCA craft, Bonteus.
[211:43.45]Again, like another 2% boss fight.
[211:47.58]Give me a break.
[212:00.93]Be more aggressive?
[212:03.13]I feel like last time I've tried to be aggressive, he just kills me in two hits.
[212:12.61]God damn it.
[212:20.93]Here, do the little sneaky, like... Come on, do it.
[212:26.06]Do your little... There it is.
[212:34.08]I'm literally waiting for it.

[212:44.82]It's an autonomous PCA craft, Volteus.
[212:52.10]Main system, reactivating combat mode.
[212:55.89]Like, what the fuck is happening?
[212:58.13]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[213:00.99]It's an autonomous PCA craft, Volteus.
[213:05.29]We'll have to break its pulse armor.
[213:07.27]Pulse armor down.
[213:08.47]Now's your chance, Raiden.
[213:22.52]Oh my god, he just almost double tapped me in one second.
[213:25.75]Holy shit, I got way too aggressive.
[214:10.74]What?
[214:11.96]Oh!
[214:14.75]Already?
[214:15.15]That doesn't look like 50% to me.
[215:00.77]Holy shit!
[215:03.67]What?!
[215:04.65]Where did- He just like, scooped me up in the middle of his mouth!
[215:10.82]Oh my God.
[215:11.90]I can't believe I almost beat this guy with one health three times.
[215:35.56]Shoot behind you.
[216:04.99]Oh, come on.
[216:05.63]That's absolute fucking horse shit.
[216:07.84]It really is.
[216:25.57]The waves are intensifying.
[216:27.51]Raven, get clear.
[216:59.79]No, you fucking idiot!
[217:01.57]Stop flying directly over my head!
[217:13.28]Get away from my head!
[217:15.26]Get out of here!
[217:16.08]Go back to your corner!
[217:17.72]You're broken!
[217:37.00]Dude!
[217:37.96]What?
[217:38.14]I couldn't jump!
[217:39.34]What?
[217:39.64]Why couldn't I jump?
[217:40.34]I was trying to jump!
[217:41.16]He was, like, glued to the ground!
[217:42.94]What the hell happened?
[217:44.16]I... I was pressing A. How come I didn't fly?
[217:49.82]Was I out of... Was I out of juice?
[217:51.25]Goddammit.
[217:54.27]Main system.
[217:54.55]Reactivating combat mode.
[218:03.67]I've looked into the enemy craft.
[218:04.45]It's an autonomous PCA craft.
[218:05.03]Verteus.
[218:08.56]Fuck you buddy.
[218:47.55]I got, like, just caught up.
[218:49.34]That was so fucking stupid.
[218:53.62]He flew over me and I couldn't stay locked on.
[219:02.68]Come back when you're level 80?
[219:09.30]You don't level up in the skin, do you?
[219:10.41]Okay.
[219:23.89]Need to grind side quest.
[219:25.49]I mean, dude, I have come one centimeter of his bar of health, like four times.
[219:31.57]I can do it.
[219:33.25]I just have to get the last hit in and just kill the guy.
[219:47.14]We're doing this right now.
[219:49.16]Like, holy shit.
[219:50.88]Give me a fucking break.
[219:54.11]I'm literally keyboard turning in World of Warcraft.
[220:18.11]Okay.
[220:18.55]We're good.
[220:23.53]Alright.
[220:36.85]Come on.
[220:37.73]This is the one right here.
[220:38.41]This is it.
[220:38.75]No more bullshit.
[220:47.07]I can't see anything.
[220:47.91]Alright, we're good.
[220:49.42]The enemy has taken heavy damage.
[221:15.86]Oh come on, that's just so stupid.
[221:20.06]Sometimes you're just in a spot where you're gonna get hit by that.
[221:25.01]Sometimes you just can't dodge anymore.
[221:33.77]This is un-fucking-bearable.
[221:38.22]This is boss number 3.
[221:39.36]What does boss number 17 look like?
[221:42.18]Holy shit.
[221:45.50]Have any humans completed this game yet?
[222:05.23]Alright, this is a good start.
[222:17.97]Huh?
[222:28.48]What?
[222:28.80]Oh, I got staggered by something.
[222:31.54]Alright, pull it together.
[222:32.40]Uh.
[222:47.48]Oh, come on.
[223:09.15]What?
[223:09.49]Why are you stopping?
[223:11.82]I did not tell you to stop.
[223:13.50]Why are you stopping moving?
[223:18.66]Right hand ammunition at 50%.
[223:22.84]Oh my god.
[223:23.64]I just got... My elbow was stuck on my chair.
[223:29.53]Hold on.
[223:30.31]I gotta move this.
[223:30.85]This is in the way now.
[223:32.03]Okay, there we go.
[223:34.93]That's better.
[223:37.21]I have free movement of my arms now.
[223:42.44]Right shoulder ammunition at 50%.
[223:56.09]I might be able to do it.
[223:57.17]Let's see.
[223:59.21]No repair kits remaining.
[224:00.51]Left shoulder ammunition at 50%.
[224:20.84]Uh-oh, I'm out of juice.
[224:28.13]I'm out of juice.
[224:29.91]I need to build juice right now.
[224:36.58]No, dude.
[224:37.38]That's the exact thing I didn't want to have happen.
[225:09.73]We're good.
[225:10.19]I win.
[225:10.45]I win.
[225:13.78]Okay.
[225:22.65]I don't think I was ever going to get through that without complaining.
[225:24.79]It's silent.
[225:30.97]I'm telling you, I put my these things down.
[225:33.70]It's better.
[225:39.16]Raven.
[225:41.30]Base three, don't even say that.
[225:42.76]You need rest.
[225:48.30]But first, a warning.
[225:58.24]That was hard.
[225:59.56]Let me just bite the controller real quick.
[226:01.94]Did you hear it?
[226:24.32]I was going like this.
[226:25.88]I was gripping it like that.
[226:27.34]480,000 credits.
[226:30.65]Wow.
[226:30.73]Ooh.
[226:30.85]That's pretty sick.
[226:31.31]Yeah.
[226:53.43]Is he going to rage at the spider boss?
[227:04.94]Probably.
[227:05.38]I don't think we should do any more bets on that.
[227:07.02]Because it absolutely is happening.
[227:13.04]But we're going to move on to Coin Game.
[227:14.70]I want to play Coin Game for like an hour or two.
[227:17.70]I got over the hump.
[227:22.69]I can come back to this if I want to.
[227:28.99]I can see why that boss is considered a... with difficulty really turns on.
[227:36.14]That was fun.
[227:37.86]I like it.
[227:38.60]Do you like the game?
[227:40.33]Yeah.
[227:42.60]All the FromSoftware games do this shit.
[227:45.42]They make you go through every stage of grief, question your reality, question everything.
[227:51.60]And then when you finally beat it, you go... That wasn't even a big deal.
[227:56.42]That wasn't even a big deal.
[227:57.54]That was nothing.
[228:03.99]It looks fun, to be fair.
[228:07.19]I would say it's very fun.
[228:13.85]How red are you?
[228:14.79]Actually, not really.
[228:23.03]You probably can take on anything after beating that guy.
[228:27.50]That's encouraging.
[228:28.56]Hey, thanks, guys.
[228:32.36]Sweat check?
[228:33.72]Uh, I don't... Well, you can't... I can't do a sweat check because there's nothing to check.
[228:37.22]Augmented human C4621 entering standard mode.
[228:43.10]two new messages check the messages 621 I've got some business to attend to I need to hog some intel to the corpse and secure a backer for our trip to the ice field one shop for you while I'm out only him and the next one are really hard actually in my opinion so wait this this is not the case of
[229:13.98]like boss 15 is not insane boss three is very difficult and then is that oh okay it is alright I see I see this one guy alright boss four is ridiculous boss 15 is insane the other bosses aren't okay registration number rb23 call sign raven so it is what I was describing so have you guys beaten this yet I'm imagining probably most of you have are now available in the arena
[229:43.66]We invite you to hone your technique.
[229:47.50]Yes, I have four times.
[229:52.28]New mercenary data.
[229:53.18]Ooh, I unlock new arena.
[229:54.40]Well, that's cool.
[229:57.41]I think that's a good stopping point though.
[230:01.21]I am a fan.
[230:02.49]I will probably stream it again.
[230:04.47]Just not right now.
[230:05.23]Because right now I want to play Coin Game.
[230:08.26]Coin Game got an update a few months ago that I never played.
[230:11.76]I don't think it's anything too substantial, but there's at least another arcade, I think.
[230:15.96]So let's go check it out.
[230:18.62]If that's all you want to see for Armored Core, maybe I'll play it again at some point.
[230:24.28]But if I can beat that, then I think I can handle most of the rest of the game.
[230:29.64]So let's go play coin game.
[230:31.46]Actually, let me go pee.
[230:32.06]I'll be right back.
[230:33.64]And I'll come back with coin game.
[230:36.25]How does that sound?
[230:40.11]Sounds good to me.
[230:42.87]Um... Do this.
[230:47.56]Do this.
[230:48.14]Alright, be right back.
