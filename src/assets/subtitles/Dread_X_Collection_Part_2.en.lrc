[00:03.34]Yeah, we'll do DreadX.
[00:10.22]Alright, what are some must-play games in the DreadX Collection 1?
[00:24.07]What is the must-play from DreadX 1?
[00:26.89]Oh my god, I can't even... Can I not even launch this game?
[00:36.98]Okay, I think I have to go.
[00:38.46]This is weird.
[00:41.37]Alright, never mind.
[00:41.93]We're good.
[00:42.49]That was weird.
[00:45.55]Everyone fears losing their mind.
[00:47.11]Let me just make sure this is not too loud.
[00:51.35]Alright, so which one should we do?
[00:56.23]There is Don't Go Out, Hand of Doom.
[00:59.40]We did that one a little bit.
[01:01.50]Summer Night Outsiders.
[01:05.22]Rotgut.
[01:06.61]Pony Factory.
[01:08.49]Shatter.
[01:09.99]We did this one.
[01:10.79]I wasn't fair to this one.
[01:11.63]I was annoyed at the internet.
[01:14.41]Do Rotgut.
[01:18.66]Pony Factory.
[01:19.54]Summer Night.
[01:37.23]Rock got... Pony Factory?
[01:38.45]Alright, we'll do Pony Factory.
[01:43.67]Let's go.
[01:48.35]Um... Does it matter?
[01:51.17]I should do... Oh, okay.
[01:56.77]That's fine.
[01:58.97]That should be fine.
[02:02.07]I remember these old... No, it's not...
[02:06.62]I remember these.
[02:08.74]It used to be... Wait, what happened?
[02:11.74]Anytime that popped up, it was always like, alright, we're in for a real one.
[02:19.25]Wait, what?
[02:21.75]What?
[02:22.69]Really?
[02:23.01]Oh, shit.
[02:30.59]Alright, let's go.
[02:34.59]Duskdev made this.
[02:35.75]Oh, shit.
[02:36.43]Alright, let's do it.
[02:38.21]Let's do it.
[02:38.77]Alright, so this is lights out, begin game.
[02:41.89]I'll turn the lights off.
[02:44.69]Lights are going off.
[02:45.87]Sure.
[02:46.01]It's because of Mambion's
[03:06.33]Here we go.
[03:12.37]Winston arrived at a solution to the moral decay of his town.
[03:17.39]He called out to hell in a secret candlelit room one evening and hell answered him.
[03:21.82]The human body could, hell promised, be twisted, stretched and broken into a kinder, more
[03:30.58]I don't think so.
[04:03.72]No, no, no, no.
[04:04.88]Okay.
[04:06.35]WASD.
[04:40.68]There's no sprint.
[04:46.36]Pick up.
[04:46.90]What is this?
[04:47.44]Oh, God.
[04:52.29]You actually have to shoot stuff?
[04:58.09]Locked.
[05:23.20]Look for the unlocked door to complete each area.
[05:29.40]This is unlocked.
[05:30.05]Okay.
[05:33.09]Hold left mouse to fire the bolt gun.
[05:34.53]R to reload.
[05:35.53]Keep on the lookout for ammo pickups.
[05:38.41]Okay.
[05:54.28]I'm telling you, I'm the guy that distracts people at the door.
[05:56.21]I distract people at the door.
[05:59.17]I'm the, you know, I'm the guy with the glasses.
[06:02.93]The actor, you know, just zoom in, it says the actor.
[06:05.79]And just like a quick few cuts of me doing things and like distracting people and doing like a magic trick behind them and stuff.
[06:11.16]I'm not the person that comes in and does this.
[06:16.38]Those are very loud.
[06:45.24]The amount of question marks... I don't think a lot of you guys were here earlier.
[06:48.34]Fuck.
[07:15.96]Fuck.
[07:16.26]I hear something running.
[07:50.33]I'm almost out of ammo, man.
[08:00.81]What did that say?
[08:01.33]The game's loud?
[08:05.75]Um, hold on.
[08:06.88]Let me help you.
[08:13.74]There, I helped.
[08:20.10]Can you not see?
[08:20.50]There we go.
[08:32.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[08:34.20]I just reloaded my gun!
[08:37.04]You were not in the hallway before!
[08:53.07]I have no ammo.
[09:02.70]I'm dead in one hit.
[09:08.00]Shit.
[09:18.03]That thing was not here.
[09:19.05]See?
[09:20.23]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[09:26.79]Just kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me, whatever.
[09:33.39]I gotta hit him with every shot.
[09:44.92]Holy fuck, okay.
[10:22.74]Fuck.
[10:23.26]I need health, right now.
[10:29.36]Duhhhh.
[10:43.55]Oh my god, there's another enemy type.
[10:47.65]What is it doing?
[10:48.27]Fuck.
[11:05.69]I think I'm in trouble here.
[11:19.99]One?
[11:20.13]Why are you guys saying one?
[11:27.42]One.
[11:33.10]Why is it we're saying one?
[11:34.50]Alright, I'm in a much better position than I was last time.
[11:44.28]Have 15 shots 70 health here he comes Okay, thank God I
[12:35.89]That ammo?
[12:36.39]That's a lot of ammo, isn't it?
[12:37.79]No, it's just tape.
[12:39.57]It's tape.
[12:40.23]Alright.
[13:03.34]Oh my god.
[13:03.80]Oh my god.
[13:26.17]I'm dead.
[13:26.97]Oh fuck.
[13:27.43]I'm dead.
[13:28.01]What do I do?
[13:33.43]I have no ammo.
[13:33.87]I don't have enough ammo.
[13:34.75]I have 19 bullets.
[13:50.09]I can't kill all these people.
[14:06.81]Ah, fuck.
[14:08.67]Alright, that was actually pretty scary.
[14:10.57]That was fucked up.
[14:11.95]I can't beat it though.
[14:14.80]I saw... You need to be really in there and you gotta get in there and get... Use your eyes.
[14:19.88]Okay.
[14:25.29]That was terrifying.
[14:27.91]Let's do another one.
[14:31.63]Which one?
[14:32.75]Summer Night?
[14:33.19]People were saying to play Rockout.
[14:40.29]People said Summer Night too.
[14:43.48]Somebody also said Steam is back up.
[14:46.86]Let's do... Yeah.
[14:51.68]Let's do Rocket.
[14:53.46]And then I'll... We'll do a few more of those Steam games too.
[15:04.43]It's bright.
[15:06.47]Oh my goodness.
[15:06.99]This looks like an old starting soon screen.
[15:22.03]Have you seen the trailer for the Morbius game?
[15:24.51]Yeah, it looks fucking cool.
[15:29.30]You'll see a rock at the curve of Gano Street when you do walk into the woods.
[15:42.62]I was pissed when they said they were making it a card game, though.
[15:48.13]What's going on?
[15:58.71]And it's like you get other cards and you use those cards to level up the other cards.
[16:04.33]I don't know.
[16:04.63]I'm not into it.
[16:16.45]And how are they going to have anybody actually give a shit about that game?
[16:21.08]I mean, it's just all different versions of Morbius.
[16:23.86]There's no other Marvel characters in it.
[16:26.70]It's like Morbius in a suit.
[16:28.88]Morbius in a tuxedo.
[16:30.24]Morbius in his beast form and stuff.
[16:33.28]It's just like, I don't care.
[16:34.47]There's no other Marvel characters in the game.
[16:38.37]I don't know if they think that it can sell on its own, but I don't think it can.
[16:44.57]Alright, I need to find Gano Street.
[16:52.64]I mean, this looks like woods to me.
[17:13.87]Are these the woods?
[17:38.81]Big bank?
[17:56.14]Electric, okay.
[17:57.44]It's like an underground dance party?
[17:59.52]This guy is really high.
[18:17.09]This guy is high as a kite.
[18:22.28]If that's the only move you're doing...
[18:26.82]Okay, so what's the deal?
[18:28.96]Yeah, like, I was sweaty.
[18:31.62]Really sweaty.
[18:32.48]Should I just keep going?
[18:35.32]It's just the- it's the frickin' peanuts.
[18:55.84]All the different Charlie Brown dances.
[19:26.69]Okay.
[19:31.82]What am I looking for?
[19:32.44]Look behind you?
[20:27.14]Nobody's following me.
[20:33.16]Rotgut.
[20:34.10]Rotgut.
[20:46.85]Who said that?
[20:49.53]Did I say that?
[20:50.87]I said that.
[21:03.29]This guy is not very scared.
[21:04.68]Look behind you.
[21:48.74]Is it a chair?
[21:49.22]Where's the light coming from?
[22:07.59]What?
[22:07.97]I'm here.
[22:11.31]What is this for?
[22:18.66]green mold cake time are these okay these are not these are not butterflies these are asses okay
[22:48.40]Right.
[22:49.00]Those are asses.
[22:50.38]Of course.
[23:01.24]That scared the shit out of me.
[23:02.11]Why would you ever come down here?
[23:16.55]Like, why would you ever do this?
[23:18.05]Would you ever come down here?
[23:21.29]Okay, I would come down here... If... Alright.
[23:27.20]If we... If there was, like... 50 of us... And 10 of them were... 20 of them were professional bodybuilders... Then, yeah.
[23:39.56]I'm only coming down here with 50 people.
[23:40.66]No, 100 people.
[23:59.80]You're a chicken.
[24:02.30]No, I'm only doing this if there's... And I'm... 10 people's too little.
[24:07.20]10 people's too little.
[24:08.18]20 people's too little.
[24:10.32]For me to be comfortable being down here, there needs to be 3, 4, 5 rows of people all walking down this way.
[24:24.01]Because, I mean, if there is a Rotgut, he's kind of a big scary guy, or like a monster or something, you understand that if he starts grabbing and attacking somebody, ten people are gonna get on top of him, and one of the bodybuilders is gonna wrap around him and start choking him out.
[24:38.71]Like, grabbing him behind like this and fucking holding him like this, like... Somebody's gonna grab him and choke him out.
[24:44.81]What the fuck was that?
[24:45.45]Was that the sus guy?
[24:47.05]What was that?
[24:48.53]What the hell was that?
[24:50.60]Was that the sus fucking face?
[24:52.02]What was that?
[24:59.50]I just caught the end of that.
[25:00.44]What the fuck just happened?
[25:03.14]I just saw the sus face.
[25:09.35]And that was really weird because I was pretending to go like this.
[25:12.17]And I let go and I just started seeing things.
[25:15.75]I'm like, wait, I didn't do that.
[25:33.86]It was some woman?
[25:37.56]Okay.
[25:39.24]But you know what I mean?
[25:39.78]I'm coming down.
[25:40.60]And we're all going to have various weapons, right?
[25:45.49]Like pipes.
[25:48.49]Like tire iron.
[25:51.61]Regular clothes iron.
[26:02.35]And you're coming down here with 50 people.
[26:11.35]And one person is gonna be the electronic specialist.
[26:15.31]They're gonna have a backpack with like 10 cell phones with SIM cards in them and shit.
[26:20.21]Like a traveling communications guy.
[26:25.41]We're gonna have this guy have a backpack with like 15 SIM cards in it.
[26:30.40]To make sure we have a cell phone signal.
[26:36.38]And that guy's right in the middle.
[26:37.68]We keep that guy directly in the middle.
[26:40.70]So no matter what, our electronic specialist can reach the surface.
[26:49.21]I don't care if this guy has to walk around with a huge antenna behind him.
[26:52.13]Going up, almost touching the ceiling.
[26:57.45]I'm almost at the end.
[27:06.28]It's going to be horrible.
[27:09.02]I just scared myself.
[27:11.16]What is it?
[27:11.52]What is it?
[27:11.92]What is it?
[27:12.30]What's Rot got?
[27:15.12]It's gonna blow up.
[27:36.55]You went the wrong way?
[27:38.75]No, I didn't.
[27:39.27]It's gonna be like...
[28:07.82]What the fuck is happening?
[28:13.29]It's gonna scream.
[28:14.33]I'm just warning everybody.
[28:15.31]It's probably gonna scream in your face.
[28:18.62]Is it getting closer?
[28:19.38]It is!
[28:26.21]Oh shit!
[28:52.55]Get me the fuck out of here.
[29:04.56]What?
[29:08.26]What's going on?
[29:13.13]I'm getting outside.
[29:29.72]What the hell is going on?
[29:31.86]What was that?
[29:35.22]Game crashed.
[29:43.27]What?
[29:50.59]Rotgut.
[29:53.94]What happened?
[29:58.86]What happened?
[30:03.45]My mouse, I can't... Look, my mouse is not even on the screen.
[30:18.31]I can't... I have to force quit the game.
[30:27.56]I can't get out of here.
[30:31.35]You just psyched yourself up.
[30:33.33]Oh, I beat it.
[30:34.03]Okay.
[30:35.95]That's kind of cool.
[30:38.41]What else is on here?
[30:40.88]Oh, right.
[30:41.30]I was going to do some more of the Steam stuff.
[30:44.08]Alright, we'll do the one that everybody wanted me to play.
[30:45.88]That's, what is it called?
[30:48.16]The one I had just downloaded?
[30:49.98]Sella, whatever it's called?
[30:53.65]Or do Summer Night?
[30:54.47]Okay.
[30:57.97]We'll do Summer Night.
[31:05.01]Absolutely nothing scary happens in this game.
[31:06.81]For best results, play in a dark room and wear headphones.
[31:09.61]Use Alt-F4 to leave.
[31:13.57]Well, that's not... that's full of shit.
[31:28.78]What?
[31:45.71]What's going on with the moon?
[31:59.00]20 points.
[32:03.74]Yeah, I'm not smoking anything.
[32:24.05]What's this one called?
[32:24.75]This is called Summer Night.
[32:26.65]The DreadX Collection, number one.
[32:29.01]There's like five or six of these.
[32:31.31]I imagine eventually we'll play them all.
[32:34.75]Or at least some of them, or most of them, whatever, right?
[32:41.14]Lovely Night.
[32:48.66]Watch out!
[32:48.94]Watch out for that guy!
[32:49.70]Watch out!
[32:50.56]Don't touch the poop!
[32:55.22]Can I move it?
[33:08.41]Get out of the way!
[33:16.35]So what, just some weird guy comes and shits on your lawn?
[33:23.74]Monkey business.
[33:29.27]Get out of the way.
[33:33.85]Get out of the way!
[33:40.76]They're blocking the way.
[33:48.36]Warm breeze.
[33:54.90]This thing's gonna scream in my face.
[33:57.20]I'm telling you.
[33:57.78]I already know.
[33:58.56]I know it's gonna scream in my face.
[34:01.22]It's gonna be like... I'm waiting for it to scream.
[34:26.06]See?
[34:26.34]It just did.
[34:33.36]I got it.
[34:38.90]I got it.
[34:41.63]Funny fungus.
[34:51.15]Hey!
[35:00.21]Stop.
[35:00.73]Don't even.
[35:01.33]I heard a sound.
[35:05.47]What was that?
[35:05.89]Can you guys hear that? ...
[35:31.33]Meet me in the park.
[35:32.15]Can you guys hear it?
[35:33.96]Is it too low?
[35:36.52]I can't turn it up, I don't think.
[35:41.18]It's like a... Turn it up?
[35:54.60]I can't.
[35:55.44]I can't.
[35:55.68]Hold on.
[35:57.46]Next transition, I'll do it.
[36:01.69]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[36:02.91]Don't stop hitting me.
[36:19.29]If I try to get... If I alt-tab, it's going to close the whole thing up.
[36:23.05]Alright, let me try.
[36:24.59]Come on, come on, come on.
[36:27.45]I got it.
[36:30.56]Can you see?
[36:30.90]I got it.
[36:32.32]Nice.
[36:33.40]It said time flies.
[36:34.48]Okay.
[36:35.92]Yeah.
[36:37.62]Here's the thing.
[36:38.66]Didn't work.
[36:40.14]Didn't fucking work.
[36:41.44]You know why?
[36:41.84]Because there's no door over there.
[36:56.93]Not that camera.
[37:09.38]Yeah, what's going on with the moon?
[37:29.35]Come on.
[37:31.68]What is that thing?
[37:38.37]I'm telling you, I'm only doing things with like 50 people.
[37:59.00]You know what I mean?
[38:00.60]I'm like, anytime I go anywhere, there's gonna be a hundred people.
[38:03.09]We're all gonna like be ready.
[38:17.64]That's not scary, it's just like a rat in the attic.
[38:36.55]Nice try.
[38:37.03]Is it on my webcam?
[39:08.35]That's... I didn't even... I've been holding right here this whole time.
[39:25.11]The battery is going low.
[39:28.49]My itchy face.
[39:31.45]The battery's gonna go to zero, and some hand's gonna come over and grab and pull, and it's gonna scream at me.
[39:39.70]Error.
[39:39.96]Okay, I don't know what it is.
[39:56.14]But, like, I feel like a lot of older people... Jump scares, like, don't work.
[40:01.54]I'm gonna pretend to be, like, a fucking 70-year-old.
[40:03.60]Okay.
[40:15.99]Whoa!
[40:16.49]What was that?
[40:17.09]Holy smokes!
[40:32.76]Oh, he's an ugly one!
[40:34.48]What the fuck?
[40:40.55]I tried to punch!
[40:41.21]I'm trying to pu-
[40:55.44]Somebody's breathing.
[40:58.01]I can't go over there.
[41:18.36]How am I supposed to go over there?
[41:26.41]Why would you punch- I'm telling you, I'm doing a triple crow hop.
[41:30.35]Like, crow hop, crow hop, crow hop, punch as fucking hard as I can directly square here.
[41:37.07]As hard as I possibly can and try to take their fucking head off.
[41:42.46]We're talking crow hop, crow hop, crow hop, fucking WHAM!
[41:46.10]You know what I mean?
[41:48.16]No, not the game, like the monster!
[42:05.81]What?
[42:11.24]Oh, what the fuck?
[42:12.80]Are you kidding me?
[42:14.74]I knew it was going to be something weird.
[42:16.32]Dude, how come there ain't 50 people in this house?
[42:30.60]Huh?
[42:38.39]Give me the batteries!
[42:38.87]Give me the batteries!
[42:44.79]I did it!
[42:49.70]Those batteries were huge.
[42:53.82]That was creepy.

[46:03.19]No, there's no way I'm getting eaten.
[46:05.35]Oh, you think I'm going to get eaten?
[46:06.93]Into the freezer.
[46:08.17]All the frozen food is coming out.
[46:10.30]And I'm taking it out of the package and throwing it out.
[46:12.26]I'm going to the fridge.
[46:13.54]All the raw meat is just like getting thrown out in front.
[46:19.46]Every piece of food that I have, it's going to be like, meat.
[46:23.96]It's going to go for it.
[46:24.66]And that's when you go fucking... Right?
[46:27.71]Oh, my God.

[47:06.94]Oh, those boots are going on.
[47:09.16]And I'm running out there.
[47:09.88]I don't care if I'm fucking naked.

[47:26.12]Uh-uh.
[47:29.01]And by the way, they're going to be two sizes too big.
[47:32.75]Two sizes too big.
[47:42.62]What am I talking about?
[47:43.38]I'm talking about if a monster were to horror movie style be in my house.
[47:58.93]Normal shoes?
[48:05.33]What if it was a dinosaur?
[48:11.18]What are you talking about?
[48:12.22]A dinosaur is an old animal.
[48:14.86]Why would it be a dinosaur?
[48:16.58]If it's a dinosaur, then okay, then that's a... I guess I'm dead.
[48:25.47]Oh, no, no, I would, no, what I would do, excuse me, I would take the standing lamp that's in the living room, take, I'd take, unscrew the light out of the standing lamp, take the lampshade off, and have a javelin and just throw it, like, right into the fucking dinosaur's heart.
[48:42.88]You know what I mean?
[48:45.50]Like...
[49:09.78]Do you really think you're special enough for a monster to come after you?
[49:12.74]I don't know.
[49:22.61]He's going off the record?
[49:23.67]What do you mean off the record?
[49:32.70]No.
[49:33.02]If a dinosaur came to the house, I would just go out.
[49:36.98]I would meet the dinosaur outside, and I would go like this.
[49:41.24]I'm huge.
[49:42.08]I'm much bigger than you.
[49:43.95]Like this.
[49:44.21]My arms would be in the air.
[49:45.89]And I'd be going like this.
[49:47.51]Go away!
[49:48.37]Go away!
[49:49.25]Go away!
[49:50.09]Go away!
[49:56.62]It would work.
[50:07.73]I'm just seeing like a clip from a movie in my head.
[50:11.10]I'm out there like, go away!
[50:12.66]Go away!
[50:13.48]Go away!
[50:14.16]And it's just... I'm the first to die in the movie.
[50:26.58]I'm the first to go.
[50:27.44]That's the opening scene of the movie.
[50:31.67]Alright, anyways.
