[00:08.84]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.48]Jermock here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:12.37]Gonna be playing on Harvest, just casually playing some Sniper.
[00:17.41]Try to shave some people's heads down a size.
[00:21.71]I love Harvest, you all know that.
[00:23.99]Mm-hmm.
[00:25.59]Where the hell is everybody?
[00:27.09]Am I gonna have to go, like, super secret Sniper?
[00:28.91]Let's go.
[00:30.97]Watch your head.
[00:32.87]Watch your head, that's a two-piece double cheeseburger.
[00:37.55]I'm actually very, very tired right now, so I... Anytime I play Sniper, if I'm really, really tired, I can do very, very well.
[00:45.18]I don't know why.
[00:45.84]I think it's because... Ah, there's a spy.
[00:48.30]I think it's because I just relax a whole lot more than if I was, you know, stressed out and trying to get headshots and stuff.
[00:54.12]But I just, you know, just... Who cares?
[00:55.80]Let's just play.
[00:56.56]Who cares?
[00:58.30]Ready?
[00:58.86]Ready?
[00:59.46]Come on out.
[01:00.80]Come on out and meet your maker.
[01:04.30]Anybody.
[01:05.37]Any second now.
[01:06.88]Annie, I missed.
[01:09.20]Right here, Pyro.
[01:14.55]Are we gonna win?
[01:18.57]Oh, we did it.
[01:19.45]Good thing I was here for the whole round.
[01:20.57]Let's do another one.
[01:22.85]Try and win Shiv, huh?
[01:24.48]Let's go in the spawn and just, like, smash.
[01:26.66]Smash.
[01:27.68]Smash.
[01:30.15]Uh-oh.
[01:31.07]I ran out of coffee.
[01:32.38]Trying to keep myself awake, and I just completely ran out of coffee.
[01:35.36]That can't happen for a Jerma video.
[01:37.26]There has to be a full coffee here at all times, ready to go down my throat, into my stomach, into my brain, and let's do it, baby.
[01:45.52]A zoo.
[01:54.50]Oh, heavy.
[01:55.43]If you didn't have crits, I would have killed you.
[01:57.95]I still might.
[02:00.57]Oh, sneaky little snake.
[02:04.31]And that's how you snipe somebody's skullcap off.
[02:08.11]You're real.
[02:08.51]Let's get it again.
[02:11.17]That's a spy.
[02:12.51]You are not a real pyro.
[02:14.86]Yeah, I knew it.
[02:16.64]I could tell.
[02:18.56]Neither are you.
[02:19.34]You're not real either, and I just keep missing these spies.
[02:23.99]I love that hat, by the way.
[02:24.97]That antler hat that that engineer has on right now, I love that thing.
[02:29.01]That's like one of my favorite hats.
[02:32.21]What is it?
[02:32.87]Merasmus' hat, I think is what it is.
[02:36.70]This is a very bad spot for me to be right now.
[02:40.42]Very.
[02:44.88]Damn it.
[02:47.74]Come on.
[02:48.18]What's going on, y'all?
[02:52.97]I'll take it.
[02:53.67]I'll take it.
[02:54.99]Oh, no, I'll get this guy.
[02:56.57]I'll get this guy.
[02:58.87]I'll get this.
[03:01.90]I backed up right into that.
[03:03.08]How many people are in this server?
[03:04.26]There's plenty of people in here.
[03:06.70]There's at least, like, two dozen people in here.
[03:09.86]Oh, no, there's not.
[03:10.94]Two dozen is 24.
[03:12.42]Right.
[03:13.24]Yes.
[03:13.69]Roger.
[03:13.93]Alright, let's get some more kills.
[03:15.69]I gotta make sure we're... No!
[03:18.05]Spy, behind you!
[03:19.49]I gotta kill him before he kills him!
[03:23.01]Oh, he got me.
[03:24.39]He must have got me.
[03:24.96]No, he didn't.
[03:26.10]You!
[03:26.96]Spies!
[03:27.82]Everywhere!
[03:29.64]And who's behind me?
[03:31.18]You little prick!
[03:32.34]Come here.
[03:34.84]Oh, thank God, Heavy.
[03:36.52]You just saved my life.
[03:38.05]Alright, I need to get my head on straight here.
[03:40.13]I'm gonna die!
[03:46.69]Get my head on straight.
[03:48.31]Don't get backstabbed.
[03:53.29]Right as I said it.
[03:54.38]Right as I said it, I got backstabbed.
[03:56.38]Alright.
[03:57.00]You know what?
[03:58.32]Am I going to do this right now?
[04:00.00]I think I'm putting on the Razorback.
[04:02.76]It's time for the Razorback to go on, bros.
[04:06.78]Backing up into spies.
[04:07.94]Backing up into knives.
[04:08.88]This started off pretty well.
[04:10.84]No.
[04:11.26]No!
[04:11.54]He's not dead.
[04:12.99]Make sure he stays dead.
[04:16.95]Is their team just spies and pyros?
[04:18.73]What's going on here?
[04:19.49]Alright, we got the point.
[04:22.13]That's a good thing.
[04:23.64]Oh, you... Staying sniper.
[04:28.62]I'm going to stay sniper on principle.
[04:30.50]This is a long respawn.
[04:31.80]Holy shoot.
[04:33.50]That's like an 18, 17 second respawn.
[04:37.74]I've only killed four people.
[04:39.08]Let's pull this out here.
[04:40.36]I've got to get some more headshots.
[04:46.00]Let's go.
[04:49.28]We're going to win this.
[04:50.56]How are we winning right now?
[04:55.20]There we go.
[04:56.36]He's standing still, but there's a spy somewhere.
[04:58.20]He's behind me somewhere.
[05:02.48]Over the rainbow way.
[05:15.20]There's... I'm like singing karaoke.
[05:18.18]How did I not hit him?
[05:20.26]I was going to say, I hit that guy right in his mouth.
[05:25.19]that too.
[05:27.19]I should have hit that guy right in his face.
[05:29.57]God damn it.
[05:34.27]Oh.
[05:35.63]Hey, yeah.
[05:35.97]Yeah, you didn't get me that time, spy.
[05:37.77]I get Razorback ranked up.
[05:40.85]What, to level one?
[05:45.13]Yeah.
[05:47.07]Oh, I got him in midair.
[05:48.31]Did I?
[05:48.53]I don't even know.
[05:52.01]Where's he going?
[05:52.45]Where's he going?
[05:54.13]Hey, that guy was, that Engineer, wow, Engineer GG.
[05:58.80]We got time for one more?
[05:59.66]I think we got time for one more, why not?
[06:02.00]Alright, well, we have changed maps to Nucleus.
[06:04.54]How are we going to end this?
[06:06.22]I'm going to give myself three lives right here.
[06:09.88]Three lives to do as much damage and as much offensive power as I possibly can.
[06:15.09]I might not even do anything, we might just win the match, let's see.
[06:21.34]Oh, looking for someone like this scout.
[06:26.60]Where is he going?
[06:27.66]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[06:30.32]This spy is so dead.
[06:31.24]Maybe not.
[06:32.30]He's going to kill me.
[06:34.17]No, he's definitely not dead.
[06:35.59]There's no way.
[06:36.25]I hit him like in the shoulder blade.
[06:38.31]Whoa, who's on that point?
[06:40.39]Oh, I got him in the head.
[06:41.09]It didn't matter.
[06:42.25]I can't shoot with this thing.
[06:44.31]Oh, that was so lucky.
[06:45.47]You cannot shoot from the hip with that damn thing.
[06:48.38]Why did I pick it?
[06:50.16]Well, because it's awesome.
[06:51.54]That's why.
[06:53.02]That's why.
[06:56.41]Bro, you are... Are you kidding me?
[06:59.05]Guy's like sitting up on the ledge.
[07:01.11]He was like chameleon blending in with the background, too.
[07:04.01]That was ridiculous.
[07:06.27]Whatever.
[07:07.86]That's one.
[07:09.14]Two more deaths.
[07:10.42]Maybe we'll win.
[07:11.00]We'll probably... I'm assuming it'll be like one death per minute.
[07:14.56]Maybe not.
[07:19.43]Yeah, you wanna dance around?
[07:20.23]You wanna dance?
[07:21.83]Yeah!
[07:26.85]Swear I thought that was a spy.
[07:28.65]Speaking of spies... Oh, man!
[07:30.71]I can't even, like, shoot anybody!
[07:33.38]Team is just too good.
[07:38.56]Alright, uh... So anyways... Apparently we have the point locked down.
[07:44.66]Yeah, there's people on the other team.
[07:46.60]I think there's just... Oh!
[07:49.26]Almost fell off the cliff.
[07:53.02]What?
[07:53.20]How did that hurt him in the face?
[07:56.12]I can't believe that!
[07:58.92]I've run that back.
[08:00.69]He's got one health.
[08:03.31]That line went right in between his eyes.
[08:07.85]That was a bunch of bologna and cheese sandwiches stuffed underneath, like, my grandmother's ass.
[08:15.05]Oh my god, that was gross.
[08:18.66]Bologna and cheese.
[08:19.86]You know, I love bologna and cheese sandwiches, but you have to be in the mood for bologna and cheese sandwiches.
[08:24.82]Otherwise, it's just gross.
[08:28.71]Well, this was a completely successful round.
[08:30.37]I killed, like, one person.
[08:33.66]You know what?
[08:33.98]Just get over here.
[08:35.08]Get the hell over here.
[08:36.19]You can shoot me all you want.
[08:37.35]I'm gonna get this.
[08:38.23]I'm gonna get this kill.
[08:39.69]And this one, too.
[08:40.57]You know what?
[08:41.75]Oh, no.
[08:42.01]He's got a big sword.
[08:42.95]Your sword's way bigger than mine.
[08:44.01]Alright, well, that's three.
[08:49.17]You know what?
[08:49.94]We'll wait till the end, because we're about to win right now.
[08:53.94]For as well as my team is doing, I haven't really done anything.
[08:58.92]I've just been kind of just sitting around like a real freak.
[09:06.19]Here we go.
[09:09.24]12 seconds.
[09:10.84]I gotta get an epic headshot right here.
[09:12.50]Epic headshot.
[09:14.66]No.
[09:17.10]This has just been like me versus... You know what?
[09:18.88]Right here.
[09:20.28]Didn't get it.
[09:20.99]Just might as well jump off the cliff.
[09:23.51]Overtime.
[09:24.01]Overtime.
[09:26.35]Overtime.
[09:28.24]Hey, I know you got, like, your camping gear.
[09:29.62]Look at this guy.
[09:30.06]He's just, like, opening and closing the gate over and over again.
[09:33.48]I think you have enough ammo and health.
[09:35.25]I think you... You don't... No, stop.
[09:36.57]Stop opening that.
[09:37.47]You don't need any more.
[09:38.49]Look, you gotta save the rest for the rest of the damn team.
[09:40.95]There's rations in there.
[09:41.83]You're eating them all.
[09:44.41]Anyways, guys.
[09:45.09]Thank you so much for watching.
[09:46.03]I really do appreciate it.
[09:47.16]Facecam Fortress 2.
[09:48.32]Sniper.
[09:48.88]Tired Germa.
[09:49.74]For the loss or for the win.
[09:51.16]I'm not really sure.
[09:52.28]But I'll see you guys all soon.
[09:53.34]And, of course, take care, everybody.
