[00:06.19]How many mini Milky Way candy bars do you think it takes to make one candy bar?
[00:12.44]You know what I'm talking about?
[00:16.86]I would say five.
[00:19.06]Oh, shit.
[00:19.70]Yeah, I'd say five.
[00:21.06]Why?
[00:21.41]I've eaten like fucking 19.
[00:24.47]How many do you have to eat before your mouth gets so dry?
[00:26.67]I always end up eating more.
[00:27.85]I eat more minis.
[00:29.73]Does that mean I've eaten like four candy bars?
[00:32.60]Alright, so... That's not good!
[00:38.41]Hunted.
[00:38.85]This game mode's called Hunted.
[00:41.67]Yeah, I think so.
[00:42.45]This is probably a terrible idea for me to try to jump.
[00:45.63]No, I'm not doing that.
[00:46.49]Screw that.
[00:46.91]I'm not jumping up on, like, one of the tents.
[00:50.62]Ah!
[00:51.50]Somebody's real trigger happy.
[00:53.12]Who was just shooting their gun?
[00:54.06]Yeah, I could hear somebody just bang, bang, bang, bang.
[00:57.96]Somebody's in trouble!
[01:01.49]Oh, that guy.
[01:02.17]Okay.
[01:02.68]No, we're good.
[01:05.66]Probably should not have just done that.
[01:12.34]Oh my god!
[01:14.76]What?!
[01:15.74]I shot you like three times in the chest and you're telling me you golf club me in like the forearm and I die?
[01:22.60]So where are you?
[01:25.88]Etalyx, where are you right now?
[01:28.47]I'm gonna give you some hints.
[01:30.86]No.
[01:31.96]Just give me one hint on where you are.
[01:34.58]There's grass.
[01:36.13]There's grass.
[01:36.63]That's a great hint, Etalyx.
[01:37.69]Very, very good hint.
[01:39.91]I appreciate the hint.
[01:41.29]There's more tents than we were next to, I'll say that much.
[01:46.31]Describe the tents to me in detail.
[01:48.71]What do they smell like?
[01:51.33]What... Where... Give me some landmarks and some sightseeing that you could potentially be doing.
[01:57.27]Are you close to me or something?
[01:59.38]No, I don't know.
[02:00.66]Am I?
[02:00.92]I don't know.
[02:02.46]I was just trying to figure out why you're focusing on me specifically.
[02:05.98]Okay, I don't know.
[02:09.30]I know, like, Booshoop has got something.
[02:15.19]Fuck you!
[02:15.85]Fuck you!
[02:17.69]Oh, who wants to do a duel?
[02:20.71]Who wants to play?
[02:21.33]Let's play Marco Polo, okay?
[02:22.80]Who wants to play?
[02:23.34]I'll start.
[02:24.76]How'd you play?
[02:27.23]Marco!
[02:29.63]Polo.
[02:30.80]Okay.
[02:32.52]Marco!
[02:34.72]Polo.
[02:36.18]No, you're further away.
[02:37.07]Hold on.
[02:39.91]Marco!
[02:42.43]I didn't even hear that bullet, so, uh... You didn't?
[02:44.71]No.
[02:45.81]Well, it don't matter because, you know, the game's over.
[02:51.75]It don't matter because the game's over!
[02:53.11]That wasn't me.
[02:54.63]That wasn't even... That was me.
[02:55.97]I don't even know where you're going.
[02:57.07]Oh, wait, that... What?
[03:00.05]Hold on, that was... That was not Etalyx.
[03:03.29]Correct.
[03:03.47]No.
[03:03.94]Why would that be?
[03:05.06]Because we were playing... I thought that was coming from that direction.
[03:11.14]I'll give you a few.
[03:14.99]You gotta do the same.
[03:16.97]Do I?
[03:17.79]Yeah, you do.
[03:19.11]That's the rule.
[03:22.74]Come on!
[03:26.14]Are you really gonna break the Marco Polo rule?
[03:31.00]I did way more than that.
[03:32.84]Whatever, you can still hear the direction.
[03:34.40]Boo's just like hunting us both.
[03:38.86]Yeah, Boo's been like dead silent this whole time.
[03:42.45]And Stealth is a zombie.
[03:43.99]I'm shooting as well.
[03:45.14]Yeah, stealth is a zombie.
[03:46.38]I feel like he's this person behind me.
[03:49.60]Like this one right here.
[03:50.80]Oh, son of a bitch.
[03:58.80]Is that stealth right there?
[04:02.78]Um, I need to... Alright, you need to do polo again like 30 more times.
[04:10.69]Oh my god.
[04:12.67]Oh my god.
[04:14.71]What?
[04:15.97]Am I really close?
[04:17.03]I don't know.
[04:19.10]No?
[04:20.96]Boo, where are you?
[04:21.70]I have no idea.
[04:22.92]Damn it.
[04:25.22]Damn it.
[04:26.44]Damn it.
[04:28.86]I don't want to.
[04:29.42]I can't go that way.
[04:31.78]I'm going this way.
[04:34.45]Okay.
[04:37.28]I just can't.
[04:39.32]I can't be seen.
[04:41.08]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[04:44.84]Eat shit!
[04:46.56]Come on, come on!
[04:48.94]The fucking grenade didn't explode!
[04:54.74]I wish we could use the phone.
[04:55.87]I think I'm near someone.
[05:01.01]How nervous is this making you, Gemma?
[05:03.21]Really nervous.
[05:04.59]What makes you more nervous, using the phone and buzzing someone nearby, or not using the phone and thinking, shit, maybe someone's nearby.
[05:12.41]Fuck.
[05:13.61]Is that, you trying to tell me something, Vu?
[05:16.75]Are you in fact nearby?
[05:17.83]Who's dead right now?
[05:18.83]Did you see some asshole with a crossbow walking around?
[05:22.95]No?
[05:24.09]Yeah, you did.
[05:24.63]I didn't see anything.
[05:27.58]Are you by the balloons?
[05:30.24]You're definitely by the balloons.
[05:33.00]You have him like a party.
[05:35.14]No, Boo's dead.
[05:36.96]Boo is dead, and I don't want to waste my crossbow on something, so you know what?
[05:43.98]I'm going to just... You know what?
[05:45.94]I'm going to get rid of all the zombies in this house.
[05:50.66]Just because I know Boo could potentially be one of them.
[05:55.81]I hear a lot of screaming.
[05:56.75]There's plenty of dog food.
[06:04.35]That's you!
[06:06.59]Was that you?
[06:09.13]It had to have been.
[06:09.97]It had to have been, right?
[06:11.17]That was you, right?
[06:11.95]Or are you just bluffing?
[06:13.86]Are you just bullshitting me right now?
[06:15.28]Who knows?
[06:21.62]Is this you?
[06:22.14]Oh my god, there's people coming in!
[06:27.08]Oh my god!
[06:31.47]Get me out of this house.
[06:32.45]I'm out.
[06:32.69]I'm out.
[06:32.93]Get me out of the house.
[06:34.65]I don't care.
[06:35.13]Get me out.
[06:35.87]I don't want to play anymore.
[06:36.97]I don't want to play this game anymore, boo.
[06:38.35]I don't care.
[06:38.67]I don't know if you're in there or not, but you might be.
[06:40.05]You probably are.
[06:40.49]Yes, you are.
[06:41.83]I might have got you.
[06:43.85]We aren't playing that game.
[06:44.55]I don't know what you're talking about, Gemma.
[06:49.21]I haven't seen anybody for like five minutes.
[06:51.61]Yeah, right.
[06:54.21]Oh, shit in my pants!
[06:56.03]Shit in my pants!
[06:57.03]Crossbow!
[06:59.05]Get crossbowed!
[07:01.33]Come on, show yourself again!
[07:03.21]I dare ya!
[07:05.77]Come on!
[07:07.17]Come on, show yourself again!
[07:10.58]Don't act like you're not gonna get- Wait a minute, where- I think I just saw movement.
[07:16.64]I may or may not have seen movement.
[07:22.03]Oh god!
[07:25.33]Hello, hiding in the dark I see.
[07:28.13]I know where you are.
[07:29.33]I didn't even see you until you shot at me.
[07:32.93]I was waiting there in the attic.
[07:34.37]I saw Jerma's panic attack underneath me when he was shooting zombies.
[07:37.61]And I was just going to wait for him to come up in the attic.
[07:39.35]But he ran out of the house.
[07:41.32]Dude, I got... That was terrifying.
[07:44.24]I just see the guy in the window firing at me.
[07:47.32]Speaking of guys...
[07:50.16]Like, busy telling a story.
[07:53.80]I like- did you see me drop down in front of you?
[07:56.17]Yeah, I should've crossbowed you.
[08:00.33]But I'm, like, already dying.
[08:01.43]Alright, ready?
[08:02.61]Oh my- yeah, I really am too.
[08:03.69]What the hell is that?
[08:07.48]Already?
[08:07.94]I can't get out of the door!
[08:16.44]Okay, I... Get me out of here.
[08:19.48]Can I climb this ladder?
[08:21.94]Thank God.
[08:22.52]This place I spawn with a ton of zombies around me.
[08:28.59]Yeah, me too.
[08:29.49]And now I've trapped myself.
[08:30.49]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy!
[08:35.59]Who killed me?
[08:38.03]Who killed me?
[08:40.54]That would be me.
[08:41.34]I spawn with, like, ten zombies underneath me, climb up a ladder and get shot in the face, and fall down the ladder and die.
[08:48.51]Great.
[08:48.85]You had your flashlight on.
[08:49.89]You should have, like, a flashlight on around.
[08:56.63]No, I've learned my lesson.
[08:57.69]No more flashlights.
[08:59.11]Unless it's necessary.
[09:03.85]Unless it is totally necessary.
[09:09.74]What am I gonna do with a pocket light?
[09:11.88]In fact, it might be necessary right now.
[09:14.74]What can I loot?
[09:15.50]What the hell?
[09:18.81]Oh, that is a ladder.
[09:20.41]Right when I turn it on, really?
[09:21.95]Who's up there?
[09:22.57]Who is up there?
[09:23.77]Are you on a roof?
[09:26.41]Where are you?
[09:28.29]I saw those tracers coming down from, like, the top.
[09:31.01]Yeah!
[09:31.67]They're on the roof!
[09:32.76]They're on the roof!
[09:37.46]on the roof.
[09:38.34]How did you get on the roof?
[09:39.96]You are legitimately, you are like Spider-Man on the roof.
[09:45.55]Do you sling some fucking web to get up there?
[09:50.04]Right when you turn your flashlight on.
[09:51.76]That was bullshit.
[09:53.28]I just look down and I see you.
