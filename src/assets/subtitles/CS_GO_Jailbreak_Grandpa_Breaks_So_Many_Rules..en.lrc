[00:07.90]Can I just come here?
[00:10.43]I want to talk to you.
[00:13.29]What are you shooting me?
[00:14.15]I just want to say something to you.
[00:15.53]Hi.
[00:16.11]You have a gun and I have a knife.
[00:17.49]What am I going to do?
[00:18.73]Nothing.
[00:20.65]You're acting really scared for somebody that shouldn't be.
[00:22.95]You have an AK-47.
[00:23.93]Get him!
[00:26.51]Get him!
[00:26.75]Get this guy!
[00:27.58]Get him!
[00:30.16]Wow, he actually went for it.
[00:37.75]He killed him!
[00:39.18]He actually killed him!
[00:40.24]Wow, that was awesome!
[00:41.88]Yes, and I want them to all crouch and stand in a straight line right here.
[00:47.62]Oh wow, you really got far.
[00:49.62]Good job.
[00:49.88]Yeah, I shot him in his face.
[01:06.75]Line up shoulder to shoulder, please, on the white area.
[01:10.69]Do not go into the cage.
[01:15.38]Hey, uh, sir, sir, excuse me.
[01:18.70]Yes, I don't think that's happening.
[01:21.34]So now we're gonna play... You can stand up now, yes.
[01:26.29]Okay, guys, so today we're gonna play something called, Do I Like the Way You Smell?
[01:32.49]Let's see, okay, so... You stink, I don't like how you smell.
[01:36.36]You all smell like shit.
[01:38.42]You don't kill people just because you don't like them.
[01:42.32]Wait, you don't kill people because you don't like them?
[01:45.46]I thought that was...
[01:49.63]I didn't like the way he smelled, so I shot him.
[01:51.87]Come on!
[01:52.29]Say, what are we doing?
[01:54.07]What are we doing?
[01:54.61]So hey, I'm just gonna walk down the stairs.
[01:56.59]Don't kill me.
[01:57.97]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[02:18.29]I have to go to the bathroom.
[02:21.41]It's a free day.
[02:23.37]Go free.
[02:25.57]Go free, my children.
[02:27.70]Ow.
[02:27.76]Stack it.
[02:30.24]Get the hell out of here.
[02:31.70]Everybody stack in the middle.
[02:33.00]We got it.
[02:33.38]Stack, guys.
[02:44.67]Look at what he's doing.
[02:45.99]He's trying to get me.
[02:47.21]He's trying to shoot me.
[02:48.67]Stack in the middle.
[02:49.77]Stack.
[02:52.23]Stack.
[02:53.67]So what are we gonna have him do here, boss?
[02:57.53]I want you guys to crouch walk to pool now.
[03:00.51]Not fast enough!
[03:01.92]You didn't do it fast enough!
[03:04.90]Sorry, guys.
[03:05.78]You had a minute to comply to that statement, and you didn't, so you died.
[03:09.46]You didn't go fast enough to the pool, and you should have gone there quicker.
[03:14.30]Got you back there, warden.
[03:15.80]Thank you.
[03:16.56]Don't thank me.
[03:17.80]You don't have to thank me.
[03:18.88]It's just doing my duty here as a prison guard, making sure that everybody's okay and we're all set here.
[03:25.09]I have to go to the bathroom here.
[03:28.45]Please don't.
[03:29.15]There is no bathroom.
[03:30.15]We're out of bathrooms.
[03:31.67]No, I'm going to the bathroom.
[03:32.87]I'm taking a dump.
[03:33.69]Do not shoot me.
[03:35.28]You shoot a man in the toilet, you would shoot a man in the toilet.
