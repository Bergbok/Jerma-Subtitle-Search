[00:45.28]Are we ready?
[00:46.28]Yeah.
[00:46.70]Boost.
[00:46.94]Bonk.
[00:47.20]Bam.
[00:47.56]Boost.
[00:47.78]Bonk.
[00:47.98]Bam.
[00:48.20]Make sure the first B is important, which is boost.
[00:50.96]I gotta get the boost.
[00:51.94]Yeah, and I'm halfway there.
[00:54.58]Next part is bonk.
[00:56.18]I got it in one shot.
[00:58.19]Alright, so you get the second B of the equation.
[01:00.70]I'm on fire!
[01:02.34]So just chill.
[01:02.70]Now I get the BAM, what do I do?
[01:03.82]Alright, so now we're gonna go... Bonk!
[01:06.94]And then take out the melee when you get a chance.
[01:08.34]It's time for the BAM.
[01:09.70]Let's get this demo up here.
[01:10.78]No, no, no!
[01:11.48]This way, this way!
[01:12.07]The spy over here.
[01:12.85]See the spy?
[01:13.77]Where I just went?
[01:14.71]In the... Oh my god, he's right here.
[01:16.73]Where'd you go?
[01:17.49]He's over here somewhere.
[01:18.55]Where?
[01:19.37]Oh, in the... Okay.
[01:21.65]Come up top, there's a heavy.
[01:22.71]Boost Bonk BAM.
[01:23.21]We're gonna totally kill the heavy.
[01:24.43]With our three damage swings.
[01:25.90]Boost Bonk BAM!
[01:32.76]You know how easy we would've won that fight if we were using weapons?
[01:39.85]Mm-hmm.
[01:41.37]Watch out!
[01:41.99]Boost!
[01:44.01]So don't... don't fuck with the formula.
[01:47.94]We have to both be on the exact same page.
[01:49.66]The formula sucks!
[01:51.24]No, we have to be on the same exact page.
[01:53.74]Get the boost!
[01:55.38]I have the boost.
[01:56.12]I don't.
[01:57.10]Do not move on to bonk phase.
[01:58.16]I'm waiting under these stairs for the boost.
[01:59.54]You get the boost and I'll be under these stairs.
[02:01.04]Yeah, watch out.
[02:01.64]There's a demo coming over.
[02:03.38]Awww!
[02:06.65]Make sure there's a pyro outside this door.
[02:12.03]Excellent.
[02:12.77]You got the boost?
[02:14.29]Don't move on to bonk yet.
[02:16.74]I'm going right.
[02:17.22]I'm going right.
[02:17.66]Do you see where I am?
[02:18.52]I'm right with you.
[02:19.62]Oh!
[02:20.70]Sentry!
[02:21.36]Bonk!
[02:21.84]Bonk!
[02:22.10]Don't come!
[02:23.08]Run!
[02:23.22]No, no, no, no!
[02:23.46]Where are you going?
[02:24.12]Where are you going?
[02:24.76]Are you killing the engine?
[02:28.28]How is he... What?
[02:28.94]What the... I'm gonna get teleported!
[02:45.52]I'm not dead.
[02:46.06]I'm alive.
[02:47.68]Okay, I have...
[02:48.74]I've got boost.
[02:49.22]Oh, he was too aggressive with his sentry.
[02:51.78]I've got boost.
[02:53.71]Boosting.
[02:56.09]Okay, where are you though?
[02:57.21]I'm going back here.
[02:58.85]I'm behind this sniper.
[02:59.79]This sniper has no idea.
[03:00.95]He's about to get BAM'd.
[03:04.33]Boost bonk BAM.
[03:04.99]He's taunting.
[03:05.61]Has no idea.
[03:06.25]Please tell me this.
[03:07.51]Thank God.
[03:09.19]Don't ever taunt.
[03:09.89]You might get boost bonk BAM'd.
[03:11.55]Boost bonk BAM.
[03:12.67]There's a heavy chasing us.
[03:14.11]Just be aware.
[03:16.17]You got your BAM ready?
[03:17.81]You got your boost ready?
[03:19.04]Always had my boost ready.
[03:20.90]This is bad.
[03:21.30]This is a terrible place to do this.
[03:22.52]This is a bad place to do this.
[03:23.82]No, this is a great place.
[03:26.32]No!
[03:27.24]I just crit this guy for 11.
[03:28.34]Let's see if I can go right in front of this guy and have him just shoot himself.
[03:34.82]Oh, damn it.
[03:38.85]Hey, Jerma.
[03:39.69]Jerma.
[03:40.41]You ever seen this through this window?
[03:42.03]I don't think you've ever seen this.
[03:43.11]There's these people here and they're looking at this map and then they start dancing.
[03:46.58]Where?
[03:46.96]What are you talking about?
[03:48.44]I see exit.
[03:49.26]I see... What?
[03:51.58]Did you see that?
[03:53.82]They're dancing.
[03:55.58]Okay, where are you?
[03:56.94]Give me a coordinate.
[03:58.26]I see.
[03:58.72]I see.
[04:00.16]There is an engineer over there in that building.
[04:03.25]There's also a teleporter right here.
[04:06.19]We can't taunt kill with a stupid Fan O' War.
[04:08.93]We just double team him.
[04:10.07]Yeah.
[04:10.51]Whoever comes out of this, just swarm them.
[04:13.82]Just mash them into the corner.
[04:15.24]Yeah.
[04:16.12]What?
[04:17.48]What?
[04:17.84]What?
[04:19.04]I wasn't even close.
[04:22.26]Was I?
[04:22.72]He hasn't turned around and looked at me once.
[04:27.90]He's dead.
[04:29.02]This engineer is following me back here.
[04:30.52]I might have to kill him.
[04:33.60]What is it?
[04:33.88]Here he is.
[04:34.42]It's him again.
[04:35.03]It's him again.
[04:35.89]Don't.
[04:36.77]Oh, how much health did he?
[04:38.35]He had five health?
[04:40.51]Don't stand on it.
[04:41.35]Stand back.
[04:42.19]Literally, I was right.
[04:43.51]Get him.
[04:44.35]Get him.
[04:44.93]Get him.
[04:45.25]Get him.
[04:45.71]Get him.
[04:47.15]Get him.
[04:49.61]Die.
[04:49.95]Oh, my God.
[04:50.95]This takes forever.
[04:51.81]No.
[04:53.55]Oh, shit.
[04:54.05]I got to run.
[04:55.15]Boost.
[04:56.01]Give me the bug.
[04:57.45]I'm good.
[04:57.99]I'm good.
[04:58.29]Alright.
[05:00.19]I'm still here.
[05:00.85]I'm safe.
[05:03.10]Oh, shit.
[05:03.56]No, I'm not.
[05:04.02]I'm not safe at all.
[05:05.58]Just don't die and I'll be back.
[05:07.06]I gotta kill this guy.
[05:09.16]I got him.
[05:09.64]Okay, it's clear up top.
[05:11.26]I have 12 HP.
[05:12.98]The first house where people go through?
[05:14.62]There's two sentries in there.
[05:16.16]Nice backstab.
[05:17.51]Oh, no!
[05:20.93]Is it still in there?
[05:23.09]I still want to do this teleporter.
[05:25.05]Oh, it's gone.
[05:25.61]It's gone.
[05:25.99]That's why I said this bicep.
[05:27.67]Come to where the teleporter was.
[05:29.45]Okay.
[05:32.74]Okay.
[05:33.58]The engineer should be back in a second.
[05:35.23]Just chill a second.
[05:37.01]No, let's bonk.
[05:39.21]Run up the stairs and we'll figure it out.
[05:42.91]I wonder, is it still here?
[05:44.53]No!
[05:45.96]Figure it, hit it, hit it!
[05:47.30]Turn around and hit the sentry!
[05:49.32]Turn around and hit the sentry!
[05:50.36]Oh, that was perfect!
[05:59.39]This is the... Of all the stupid shit we've done, this is the stupidest.
[06:03.92]Why is so much interesting stuff happening?
