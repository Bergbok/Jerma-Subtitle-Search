[00:10.59]so those of you that know me know that it's very difficult for me to play a game and talk at the same time so we're just gonna let the it's gonna let the game speak for itself and I'm gonna burn to death all right guys turn on your favorite rock song because this is where we get nuts
[00:34.50]This is where we track somebody.
[00:37.10]Where is he?
[00:37.74]Where is he?
[00:39.64]Across the way.
[00:40.04]We gotta protect this hammer.
[00:42.17]That's what it's all about.
[00:45.27]You alright?
[00:46.21]No, you're not.
[00:49.37]I'm having a lot of fun with this game, though, guys.
[00:51.89]It is free to play on Steam.
[00:54.47]And you just kind of run around and shoot people, right?
[00:57.47]That's fun.
[00:59.31]You know what else is fun?
[01:00.03]Like dropping down on somebody that has no idea.
[01:04.18]And then having him get the health pack and heal to completely full health.
[01:08.14]Doesn't matter though, I'm gonna get the hammer.
[01:11.26]Yeah, I'll get the hammer.
[01:13.24]Who wants to mess with me?
[01:14.04]I got the fucking hammer.
[01:16.16]You wanna get railroaded?
[01:17.28]I'm gonna crush this guy up here.
[01:21.70]Oh, he's... I'm gonna beat this guy down here.
[01:23.82]He has no idea!
[01:26.35]Oh, no!
[01:28.61]Yes!
[01:30.93]Alright, so, for those of you that have no idea what just happened right there, this is Capture the Flag.
[01:36.89]When you capture the flag, you can kill people with the flag.
[01:39.92]It's an instant kill.
[01:41.56]So, what happened is... Hold on, I need to pay attention here for a second.
[01:47.78]We both kill each other at the same time.
[01:50.64]Come on through.
[01:55.74]Daddy!
[01:58.72]Daddy!
[02:00.16]No!
[02:03.38]Daddy!
[02:05.02]Why am I saying daddy?
[02:06.04]What the fuck does that mean?
[02:08.19]You know what, buddy?
[02:10.31]I've had enough out of you.
[02:12.99]I've had enough.
[02:14.83]Why was I saying daddy?
[02:16.59]That was very strange.
[02:18.59]Daddy, help me!
[02:20.19]I'm being chased by a mean man!
[02:23.00]Oh, you got a shield, screw you!
[02:29.21]Holy shit, look at my character!
[02:30.67]Are you serious, dude?
[02:39.31]I look like the cookie monster!
[02:44.43]That's two cookies!
[02:46.03]That's so awesome!
[02:51.37]I don't ever want to get my head back.
[02:53.91]I want to be the Cookie Monster forever.
[02:56.47]Can that be a thing?
[02:57.21]Well, I guess it could, but I'm gonna die.
[03:02.97]No, don't take my Cookie Monster avatar.
[03:04.87]Oh shit, oh shit, look out, boys.
[03:10.25]Ooh, one shot and I'm dead.
[03:14.53]Better make this count.
[03:16.05]I see health over there, though.
[03:18.07]Gonna make the runaround.
[03:27.93]This is not safe.
[03:28.99]Not safe!
[03:30.25]Not safe!
[03:32.51]Dude, the title of this video is just gonna be like, The Noise Video.
[03:39.51]Where I just make like a shitload of noises.
[03:43.15]It's intense though, man, it is!
[03:44.49]I should not have jumped.
[03:50.03]Alright, now we're safe.
[03:50.77]Now I don't have to make as much weird noises.
[03:56.44]Fuck you!
[03:57.88]Sorry.
[03:58.84]That was a little loud and mean.
[04:02.78]Good job.
[04:06.15]You can dance around all you want.
[04:07.49]That's fine.
[04:09.93]Let's string it together here, huh?
[04:24.69]There he is.
[04:25.17]He just killed one of my boys.
[04:27.63]Come up this way.
[04:29.03]Yeah, you ain't getting away with that.
[04:33.98]Ah!
[04:37.28]Jeez, this guy's got like a cluster bomb!
[04:38.84]I ain't going that way.
[04:41.76]I'm gonna wrap around, dude.
[04:43.26]Holy hell.
[04:44.72]And a handbasket.
[04:47.28]I got two grenades.
[04:49.06]Grenades are important.
[04:50.82]That's for sure.
[04:54.64]You're about to see why.
[04:56.12]Can he walk into it?
[04:56.90]No, he's not.
[04:57.50]He's smarter than that.
[04:59.18]But is he smart enough?
[05:02.24]Got the assist.
[05:03.72]Wish I could have saved him in time, but that just wasn't gonna happen.
[05:15.41]Don't rain fire on me!
[05:17.31]I have too many holes in my body.
[05:20.61]Where's our health pack?
[05:21.53]I'm on a five kill streak.
[05:22.53]Right here!
[05:23.05]Jeez, this guy's still on my ass.
[05:24.73]Look at my health.
[05:27.23]Help me.
[05:28.85]Nice.
[05:29.41]Okay.
[05:30.45]Here's our flag.
[05:31.03]We're gonna cap it.
[05:32.17]Nice job, team.
[05:35.45]I wanna get like a ten kill streak.
[05:36.99]Is that gonna happen right now?
[05:38.25]It could.
[05:39.91]It could.
[05:46.91]Come on!
[05:48.03]Whatever.
[05:48.83]Somebody will kill him.
[05:52.05]Somebody will kill that guy.
[05:54.70]I'm gonna get the hammer.
[05:57.18]Actually, I think I could get this.
[05:59.62]There's probably two or three people in here protecting it, which means you throw a grenade and it just insta-kills someone.
[06:04.38]Nope.
[06:05.74]I could pick it up, though.
[06:06.76]Let's pick it up.
[06:07.76]Going for another hammer kill.
[06:10.40]He's gonna wrap around this corner!
[06:12.47]Damn it.
[06:16.81]Screw you!
[06:20.17]Give me the health.
[06:21.25]Cookie Monster Man.
[06:23.61]I am the globally known Cookie Monster.
[06:28.13]I think somebody has our flag, though.
[06:29.29]I don't think we can cap this.
[06:31.35]Oh, now I can.
[06:34.93]He doesn't know I'm behind him.
[06:36.71]He has no idea.
[06:37.41]You know what?
[06:37.73]We're gonna drop this.
[06:42.41]I'm sorry.
[06:43.19]I'm sorry.
[06:43.75]I would've killed him.
[06:45.61]I will kill him.
[06:46.99]Oh, I will kill him.
[06:52.45]There's so many people!
[06:57.76]Oh, I had a fucking streak going!
[07:03.56]I like this gun.
[07:04.58]It could be a little better, though.
[07:06.74]This loadout could be a little better.
[07:13.08]And here.
[07:21.51]Oh, boy!
[07:23.04]Got it.
[07:23.96]Bang!
[07:27.96]We won!
[07:30.34]We are the winners.
[07:32.86]Quick, everybody do the dance you get for free for downloading the game.
[07:40.94]We won.
[07:41.63]That's Loadout, guys.
[07:42.53]It's on Steam.
[07:43.09]It's free to play.
[07:44.19]If you want to check it out, go check it out.
[07:46.31]Take care, everybody.
[07:46.87]See you all soon.
[07:47.53]Take care, everybody.
[07:48.43]And goodnight!
