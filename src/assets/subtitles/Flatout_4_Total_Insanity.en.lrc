[06:57.44]I thought people were supposed to fly out of the windshield in this game.
[07:04.51]There we go.
[07:04.91]One of these times that's gonna make me throw up.
[07:09.80]We're okay.

[07:11.95]I gotta get to, like, third.
[07:13.01]I don't even, like, know this course, either, and I'm somehow okay.

[08:15.42]Please, for the love of God.
[08:20.42]I was in first place, and now I'm in eighth.
[08:25.48]What the fuck was that?
[08:26.69]I ran over a bush, and my car freaked out, and now the camera's freaking out.
[08:30.71]I'm almost in the last place.
[08:38.29]I was in first.
[08:39.89]And let it overtake me.
[08:42.57]This car is beat the fuck up, man.
[08:46.73]Well, let's slowly just make it to the finish.
[08:50.41]Although, you know, weirder things can happen.
[08:52.23]I might be able to do, like, a huge jump.
[08:53.73]You think there's, like, there's gotta be, like, a secret Yoshi's Island Mario Kart skip, right?
[09:00.53]There has to be.
[09:05.09]I love how both doors are just open.
[09:06.49]Alright, we're going for the Mario Kart skip.
[09:21.04]Oh, we didn't get it.

[11:00.60]Destroy as many items as possible.
[11:02.71]In the air, press A to add... Okay.
[11:07.43]A to eject... Okay, eject the driver.
[11:12.18]Do I have to do it?
[11:12.82]This is like Angry Birds.
[11:18.61]That didn't do anything.
[11:23.79]That didn't do anything.
[11:24.93]I didn't do a damn thing.
[11:29.27]That didn't knock over anything.
[11:30.67]What?
[11:34.39]Get it!
[11:36.15]What the fuck is going on?
[11:38.60]Why am I not knocking anything over?

[11:53.89]See if I can get the car to go up a little further.
[12:00.13]Well, no, that's it.
[12:01.11]I just exited the arena.
[12:03.13]I just got out of the arena.
[12:03.91]I left early.
[12:06.77]We were down to like the fourth quarter and there was like two minutes left and I left.
[12:10.91]I left the arena.
[12:13.11]Good thing I got on the leaderboards.

[14:38.90]It's alright.
[14:40.02]I already beat it.
[14:43.86]I don't think anybody could ever do this because you would just die.
[14:46.14]You can't throw yourself out.
[14:49.61]You can't pull a fucking Gonzo the Great and expect to still live.
[14:58.35]Even Gonzo used a net, didn't he?
[15:03.23]Alright, come on.
[15:04.17]Not lucky enough for 13,000.

[15:21.58]Oh, okay.
[15:22.34]But I suck at video games.
[15:24.10]Number 7 in the whole world.

[16:09.04]Apparently, that's the case.
[16:16.17]This is stupid, everybody just explodes.
[16:18.27]This isn't even a destruction journey, this is all cars explode.
[16:23.55]I'm still alive.
[16:26.99]Remember when we went to that destruction derby where you drove into somebody and they explode?
[16:32.09]Oh yeah, that was a lot of fun!
[16:33.75]Remember guys, if you get into a car accident, your car explodes.
[16:43.17]Every time.

[17:15.51]I can do the online mode, I just want to check them all out in single player.
[17:20.93]How is this even a destruction version?
[17:30.01]This is fucking stupid.
[17:33.74]No cars are breaking up, everything's just blowing up.
[17:40.04]That guy just... Alright, let's see, hold on a second.
[17:43.48]That guy just went off a jump and when he landed his car exploded.
[17:47.34]That's not what happens when you fucking drive a car off a jump.
[17:52.86]You don't explode.
[17:54.08]Somebody had a real, real love affair with explosions in Destruction Derby.
[18:06.40]Alright, I like don't think I even want to do this for another 45 seconds.
[18:09.46]What is this thing?

[24:18.97]Don't use nitro.
[24:19.87]Go right through here.
[24:20.63]This is a straight shot.
[24:23.21]Through the security scanner.
[24:26.04]You are clear.
[24:27.78]Easy.
[24:28.46]Easy.
[24:28.70]I'm trying to break right now.
[24:29.74]Good.
[24:30.78]Now I got plenty of fucking boost.
[24:32.64]Now we do.
[24:35.72]Can I hold off?
[24:36.26]I got a piece of wood covering the windshield.
[24:40.96]God fucking damn it.
[24:44.47]I'm just fucking up this whole person's house.
[24:46.40]Go!
[24:48.34]Go!
[24:53.48]Fuck!
[25:06.17]It all goes to shit right before that garage.
[25:07.97]I keep, like, losing.
[25:12.72]After this next checkpoint, I gotta like chill the fuck out and stop going like 110 miles per hour.
[25:21.06]Like right here, just slow the fuck down.
[25:22.34]I keep like losing control right there.
[25:25.80]There we go.
[25:27.10]Now just drive.
[25:29.18]You do like a tiny push, that's good.
[25:32.34]So now just chill out, go right through the front door.
[25:34.48]There we go.
[25:37.72]Right ahead.
[25:40.18]Easy.
[25:42.95]Holy shit.
[25:45.07]Holy shit.
[25:46.43]I don't know where I'm going.
[25:47.67]I think I'm still going.
[25:49.55]I'm going.
[25:56.02]It's alright.
[25:56.38]I got $25.
[25:56.66]I'm good.
[25:59.88]I'm good.
[26:00.50]We beat it.
[26:02.36]Sending data.
[26:02.84]Number one in the world.
[26:10.12]I don't have the baby Jerm badge anymore.
[26:11.86]I think you can change it.
[26:14.27]I think you can say, like, what badge you want to use in your settings.
[26:17.33]Alright, this is the last one.
[26:19.63]Carnage, and then we should be able to unlock this one.
[26:21.27]I want to just go play online, I think, maybe.
[26:24.35]It's in anger.
[26:26.45]Valver, if you're looking for a challenge, try playing with 200% damage modifier.
[26:29.87]No thanks.
[26:32.07]I don't think that's a good idea.
[26:35.29]When are we doing Lego City Undercover?
[26:37.05]Probably tomorrow.
[26:38.99]Depends on how far we get in this.
[26:41.69]Wait, what?
[26:43.78]Hey, Dedo, thank you for the 15 bucks.
[26:45.98]He was number one.
[26:48.02]I was.
[26:48.76]Thank you.
[26:50.22]Gain points by damaging your opponents and smashing through the environment.
[26:53.92]Okay.
[26:55.15]But yeah, thank you, Dedo, for the 15 dollars.
[26:56.55]Much appreciated, dude.
[26:58.65]I'm just gonna beat the shit out of opponents.
[27:00.95]We got it.
[27:03.59]Easy.
[27:05.20]Easy thing you told me to do all day.
[27:16.83]Oh, I just fucked that guy up.
[27:25.77]How many points did I get?
[27:27.09]85 points?
[27:28.37]What do I need?
[27:29.03]25,000?
[27:29.15]You got it.
[27:31.55]Oh god, what am I doing?
[27:33.60]Not that fast.
[27:34.86]Easy.
[27:41.38]Oh, there's no cars even remotely near me.
[27:51.27]Just taking shit out.
[27:52.19]Why does this stuff not count?
[27:53.37]Get out of my fucking face.
[28:00.33]Get out of town, my friend.
[28:09.02]One time I did that in real life, by the way, guys.
[28:10.88]I didn't throw a real fence like that.
[28:16.78]That was real life I did that I swear to god, I swear to god This is seriously too fast
[28:44.28]Come on, cause this guy has a destruction problem.
[28:48.61]Crash this guy.
[28:52.01]Alright, well, I'm going to hold onto the nitro.
[29:15.72]Somebody just gave me a hundred fucking dollars.
[29:17.94]Somebody just gave me a hundred fucking dollars.
[29:21.17]Somebody, a hundred dollars?
[29:24.33]Major 598.
[29:24.63]Thank you, Major 598, for the one hundred dollars.
[29:38.87]And they say, the term of my mom gave me a hundred bucks to buy food for the rest of the month.
[29:44.70]So I want to spare you ten dollars.
[29:46.54]Here is a hundred, here's ten thousand bits.
[29:50.46]I hope I did the math right.
[29:54.36]Ah, well Major, you didn't do the math right.
[29:57.32]Uh, you added an extra zero.
[29:59.72]So, uh, so thank you for the hundred dollars.
[30:05.80]He made the hundred joke without knowing.
[30:09.95]But that's very generous of you.
[30:15.27]What?
[30:17.36]Maybe you could contact Twitch customers support and see if they'll remove one of those zeros.
[30:24.68]But I'm not sure they will.
[30:26.46]Anyways, thank you, Major.
[30:27.40]100 bucks.
[30:28.82]It was a very good joke if it was one.
[30:32.36]And of course, that's a lot of money.
[30:37.93]8,000 points is not enough.
[30:41.75]Actual $100 joke, that's right.
[30:46.39]A $100 gaff.

[32:21.49]No, I don't want to be the jokey guy.
[32:24.55]I'd rather be the guy in the construction outfit.
[32:29.76]But anyways, thank you to KXZ501 for the 10 bucks.
[32:33.56]My girlfriend says I'm hopeless at fixing appliances.
[32:35.52]Well, she's in for a shock.
[32:37.87]What?
[32:38.99]What does that mean?
[32:42.45]While we wait for people to come in, I want to take a look at something here real quick, see if I can get the video camera to work.
[32:51.24]Let's just put this up here.
[32:55.04]Are we bright enough?
[32:56.16]I'm not sure if we're bright enough.
[33:00.39]Got this today.
[33:02.29]As you know, this is a
[33:07.79]That's a good old Louis Vuitton bag.
[33:11.83]I just was in the area.
[33:12.87]I was in a nice place.
[33:14.09]I wanted to get it.
[33:14.51]Those of you who know Louis Vuitton, it's very, very expensive.
[33:18.65]Take a look.
[33:19.77]Good stuff.
[33:21.89]Very good bag.
[33:24.13]Highly recommend it.
[33:26.75]Yeah, Louis V. Well, audio's a little laggy.
[33:30.01]I know.
[33:30.49]I haven't fixed that yet.
[33:31.67]What?
[33:36.02]That back is mine.
[33:38.38]I got... Louis V, man.
[33:41.66]Also... Oh, big deal, big deal.
[33:44.46]Have you guys ever had this before?
[33:46.92]Banana milk?
[33:47.74]This shit is unbelievable.
[33:53.03]It's like the best stuff ever.
[33:54.57]I would highly recommend drinking it.
[33:59.47]It's so good.
[34:02.85]And like...
[34:05.56]I wish I could fucking take that shit everywhere with me.
[34:07.44]Everywhere.
[34:10.50]Like, if I could take that fucking everywhere, I would take it with me.
[34:16.51]Why isn't nobody in this game?
[34:26.09]There's a delay.
[34:28.50]I know, I've never fixed it.
[34:30.12]I have not fixed it.
[34:34.32]I know there's an audio delay.
[34:37.65]How come there's no people?
[34:46.10]It's a really nice bag.
[34:52.96]If I could fucking take this with me, I swear to God.
[34:57.61]Like, you ever wish there was some kind of container that you could carry something like this in?
[35:06.13]I would fucking bring it everywhere.
[35:07.19]I really would.
[35:07.67]Swear to God.
[35:13.81]Now that I think about that, like... I'm looking for a container.
[35:25.05]This should do, I think.
[35:32.39]I just want to take it with me everywhere, you know?
[35:40.31]I can actually, like, now I can take it with me.
[35:50.67]Yeah, that works for me.
[35:55.57]Like, now I can hold this in a container and bring it wherever I want.
[36:02.68]Cool.
[36:08.04]Made in Paris.
[36:09.00]Made in Paris!
[36:11.26]Nice.
[36:14.02]Somebody came in and left.
[36:16.66]Wait, what?
[36:26.52]Beer.
[36:29.76]Hey, thank you, Saucerato, for the 200 bits.
[36:33.36]What a nice bag.
[36:34.04]Here's your money back for it.
[36:39.54]Okay, so... Somebody fucking left.
[36:42.83]Where are the players?
[36:46.35]Only 45 people are in-game?
[36:48.11]Are you fucking serious?
[36:49.65]What if I make it party mode?
[36:57.58]It's a genuine milk bag.
[37:06.75]It's a genuine milk bag.
[37:08.01]Alright, guys, what the fuck?
[37:10.17]I guess we're gonna have to just keep doing this.
[37:11.49]What do I need?
[37:12.73]120 more thousand points?
[37:14.45]Alright, I fucked this one up.
[37:15.53]I didn't do this one.
[37:22.20]Hold on, I can't even see.
[37:26.22]Alright, that should be good.
[37:34.94]Go right in the... This one right there.
[37:36.78]Come on!
[37:37.08]Come on!
[37:37.42]Come on!
[37:38.38]Come on!
[37:39.48]Fucking come on!
[37:46.42]Can't have milk without cereal.
[37:50.19]Yeah, the milk is fake.
[37:59.59]Come on!
[38:03.52]Right there.
[38:05.30]God damn it.
[38:06.02]This is much harder than it looks.
[38:10.25]This is way harder than it looks.
[38:20.41]That should be it.
[38:21.27]It doesn't even matter.
[38:21.89]It's got to be like a beautiful perfect.
[38:24.51]It's not going to even land in one.
[38:25.65]Last one.
[38:26.31]God damn it.
[38:26.97]This is so hard.
[38:31.04]Drink the milk?
[38:31.58]No, I want to take it with me.
[38:32.58]I want to carry it with me.
[38:35.06]I need to take that with me.
[38:39.10]I was looking for a container that I'd be able to hold that in and bring it with me wherever I wanted to go.
[38:47.01]Just don't even move it.
[38:50.55]It should drop right down the middle.
[38:53.21]Come on.
[38:54.81]I went out of the fucking bounce.
[38:56.17]Oh my god.
[38:57.01]Fuck me.
[39:03.66]I know I need to bounce it too, but maybe I should just go, like, down.
[39:09.60]Like this.
[39:13.12]Dammit.
[39:16.76]Right down the middle.
[39:19.62]Drink the milk?
[39:20.70]I don't know.
[39:25.58]Maybe that'll do it.
[39:27.69]Right there, come on.
[39:28.35]Boink.
[39:29.01]And then up.
[39:32.90]So close.
[39:33.40]I think I can still do it.
[39:34.30]One more.
[39:45.06]That should be it.
[39:45.84]Come on!
[39:47.86]Right there.
[39:48.34]Boink, and then up.
[39:50.23]You stupid motherfucker.
[39:58.13]Bank off the paddle?
[39:59.07]I'll try that, actually.
[40:00.01]It's not a bad idea.
[40:05.14]How am I going to go right into it?
[40:09.52]That's going to be too hard.
[40:18.50]Wow, game.
[40:19.15]Hold on, let me try to turn it down.
[40:20.21]Hold on, I'll turn it down.
[40:21.43]One sec.
[40:22.67]Oh my god, she knows it's her fucking back!
[40:52.81]What the hell just happened?
[40:54.11]Oh, I was like, I was out, I was alt-tabbed.
[41:01.68]Go for the eyes.
[41:06.22]But I just, I needed a place to hold my fucking milk!
[41:09.40]Doesn't anybody understand this?
[41:13.06]And it just, alright, I'm about to just get out of here and fucking, and play the other mode.
[41:21.62]What can I do more?
[41:22.26]I think I can do better than that.
[41:23.36]I can do better than this.
[41:26.96]Yeah, I can do better than that.
[41:33.83]Wow, he got us.
[41:39.85]Oh, the angry birds.
[41:40.61]I already got pretty high points on that one.
[41:44.98]Thank you.
[41:46.76]Too quickie for the 10 bucks.
[41:48.12]It says bag fund.
[41:49.74]Well, thank you.
[41:51.33]Also Bjork, thank you Bjork for the $5, can't have milk without cereal.
[41:54.53]That was from before.
[41:56.60]Thank you guys.
[41:58.42]Alright, I need to get like 20,000.
[42:00.08]I need to combo this.
[42:04.98]Right here is the best part to do it.
[42:07.11]Just ram the fuck into everybody.
[42:10.42]I've got a x3 multiplier right here.
[42:11.66]Come on.
[42:12.34]Keep it going.
[42:15.87]Make that guy crash.
[42:16.81]Slow down.
[42:17.17]Slow down.
[42:19.61]Easy.
[42:20.63]Keep going.
[42:20.89]Checkpoint.
[42:22.11]Fuck up that guy's day.
[42:25.33]We're in x3 still.
[42:26.53]Alright, that's good.
[42:27.09]That's a good start.
[42:29.11]Fuck the boss up.
[42:36.98]Shit.
[42:39.40]You can tell when you're freaking out.
[42:41.92]You accidentally hold the horn down.
[42:49.05]It's hard to string shit together though.
[42:50.57]It really is.
[42:50.89]There we go.
[42:51.19]Come on, I gotta find another person to do that to.
[43:06.31]Well, he just, like, fucked me up.
[43:08.91]I, like, ran right in that guy's face, and he fucked my face up.
[43:12.99]Great.
[43:14.89]Although I'm still getting points, though.
[43:16.53]Come here.
[43:23.90]Still going.
[43:26.26]Nice.
[43:30.36]10,000.
[43:30.40]Driving this guy's ass.
[43:36.01]Is that a person's car just staying in the middle of the road?
[43:43.16]Power hit.
[43:44.42]Very nice.
[43:44.88]Come on.
[43:51.04]That guy just ghosted through me.
[43:55.55]That guy just totally freaked the fuck out.
[44:00.47]That was bullshit.
[44:04.93]10,000 more.
[44:09.04]And then we're good to go.
[44:16.20]I want to go through the house, but I can't.
[44:20.33]Nice.
[44:24.71]That's three.
[44:25.25]I blew that guy up.
[44:26.19]That's gotta be worth something, right?
[44:30.29]Holy shit, that guy exploded.
[44:32.54]Nice.
[44:34.26]In fifth place, not doing too bad.
[44:37.08]I could be doing better, but I'm not doing awful.
[44:42.73]Did I do it?
[44:44.95]Come on.
[44:47.71]I'm so close, just give me the bronze so I can do the next thing.
[44:56.75]Swear to God if I don't get the $25,000, I'll throw up.
[44:59.75]Thank God.
[45:04.58]Is there a clown car?
[45:05.56]Probably.
[45:09.52]Shit.
[45:10.58]I guess I'm still going the right way.
[45:13.50]Somehow.
[45:14.08]Some magical, magical way.
[45:15.80]Alright, well that's it.
[45:18.28]I did it.
[45:18.76]It's okay.
[45:19.04]I'm up to two in the world.
[45:26.52]I'm okay with number two in the world.
[45:34.06]Car looks... Next... This car's three looks great.
[45:36.21]147.
[45:39.71]Come on.
[45:43.35]I really need to do the stupid cup one.
[45:47.39]I have to do it.
[45:48.13]I have to beat it.
[45:48.77]There's no turning back.
[45:53.11]Never number one.
[45:57.61]Drink the milk?
[45:58.42]No!
[45:59.40]It's going into the fridge!
[46:00.46]Come on, this is it!
[46:09.00]Right in this one!
[46:11.74]Oh, you son of a bitch!
[46:15.43]Hey, KXZ501, thank you for the $15!
[46:18.41]So, milk bag confirmed for Jerma Rumble.
[46:20.71]Yep.
[46:21.45]Sure.
[46:21.61]Sure.
[46:23.67]Sure.
[46:28.30]What the fuck was that?
[46:30.72]That might be good.
[46:33.20]This has got to be a good one.
[46:37.98]This ain't going to work.
[46:43.08]It's got to be a good, like, bouncer.
[46:46.67]Where I'm going to be like, no, that ain't going to happen.
[46:52.19]Dude, I can't do this one.
[46:56.25]I cannot do this one.
[46:58.90]This one's too fucking sloppy.
[47:11.22]Fucking break.
[47:12.04]Let's do it now.
[47:22.59]Maybe I'll bounce.
[47:23.29]Maybe I'll get a huge bounce here.
[47:24.45]Like right there into the cup.
[47:25.67]Come on.
[47:26.03]Bounce.
[47:36.28]This one sucks.
[47:44.94]Finally.
[47:46.18]Get in there.

[48:21.06]Thank God.
[48:27.34]Wait.
[48:29.88]Is that just going to give me 245 points?
[48:31.77]That just gives me 300 points.
[48:34.55]Oh, thank goodness.
[48:35.21]Alright.
[48:35.39]At this point, we just unlocked the high jump.
[48:39.06]High jump.
[48:42.92]Okay.
[48:44.08]Easy enough.
[48:47.06]Adjust the angle by holding and releasing the button.
[48:48.80]Try to go as high as possible and try landing on the net.
[48:53.57]Okay.
[48:56.11]As high as possible.
[49:04.55]Wait and try landing on the net.
[49:07.99]Uh, wait.
[49:08.77]Hold on.
[49:10.63]Is that not supposed to... What?
[49:13.57]I need to go down there?
[49:15.17]It wouldn't, like, go through there.
[49:17.78]Hold on.
[49:19.68]Oh.
[49:20.98]It'll make it easier.
[49:24.72]Okay, I'm... Now I, like, understand what's happening.
[49:36.20]Well, dude, the last one was like, you had to do it before here.

[49:50.03]Ah, that sucks.
[49:54.93]No.
[49:56.87]Oh my god.
[50:02.42]I accidentally pressed the button, so what if I just pull...
[50:11.87]I gotta turn the game volume down because like game developers don't understand that like the games are so fucking loud That even when it's at like fucking 10% it blows your ears up.
[50:22.92]When will they ever learn?
[50:24.00]Are they ever gonna learn?
[50:25.60]I don't think they're ever gonna learn There we go 65
[50:39.70]Oh shit, now I have to attach to the net.
[50:41.74]I get it.
[50:41.98]Let me try it again.

[54:03.66]I know how to do this.
[54:04.98]Just restart it.
[54:15.23]Sorry, I got angry at the game, like, volume thing, and then I had to go pee.
[54:22.32]I want to, like, do it, like, right now.
[54:24.16]Nope.
[54:26.64]What do I need for bronze?
[54:28.90]60?
[54:29.08]Fuck, I'm doing this so incorrectly, apparently.
[54:30.86]I gotta, like, just skim here, and then I punch it right here.
[54:45.25]Fuck.
[54:47.53]How am I... How are you ever supposed to go higher than this?
[54:49.81]What the fuck?
[54:58.79]Can I, like, go further than that?
[55:00.23]No, I can't go further than this.
[55:10.43]Just drive straight and that's gonna fuck me up, isn't it?
[55:15.34]Why does this shit even exist?
[55:18.72]Why the fuck is this even here?
[55:23.72]What the fuck is that even there for?
[55:26.72]Like, honest to god, I just got like a fucking gold medal.
[55:28.52]Are you kidding me?
[55:34.48]What's the point of them even being here?
[55:39.65]If they don't want you to like weave around.
[55:43.17]Oh shit, that was too fast.
[55:49.27]Like, I can get 90.
[55:49.97]I can do 90.
[55:55.32]Definitely.
[56:02.73]Maybe not 90, but maybe like 80-something.
[56:05.05]90!
[56:05.43]It's alright, I got that one.
[56:12.18]So what did I get for points?
[56:15.68]We did it.
[56:17.30]We did it.
[56:19.40]Okay, we unlocked the next one.
[56:21.30]Roberts and Sons Lumbermill Carnage.
[56:24.80]Sure.
[56:25.72]Sure thing.
[56:26.04]Let's try this one.
[56:30.60]Alright, and then we're gonna play online.
[56:31.64]Like, any of you guys have this game?
[56:32.94]There's only, like, 30 people online.
[56:37.30]Then this game, like, just came out.
[56:38.38]It was a huge deal.
[56:40.38]This is on the front cover of Game Informer.
[56:43.42]Game Informer did, like, a 28-page piece on this.
[56:51.39]Alright, just gotta kick everybody's ass.
[56:58.41]Right at the very beginning, you gotta just use your nitro and just fuck with everybody.
[57:01.31]I'm gonna do it again.
[57:07.85]Nobody wants this shit.
[57:10.42]Does this game reformer still exist?
[57:16.36]I'm pushing this guy way faster than I'm driving.
[57:21.62]And I only got 1600 points for that, somehow.
[57:25.77]Holy shit, this place sucks.
[57:31.49]Like, go back to career mode?
[57:32.61]Like, I don't get it.
[57:33.23]Look at that.
[57:33.65]Where's my points?
[57:34.17]Where's my points?
[57:34.74]I landed on a guy.
[57:36.16]I landed on top of a guy.
[57:38.18]And I didn't even get more than, like, fucking 200 points.
[57:40.88]I got more points for the checkpoint than I did for landing on top of that fucking dude.
[57:59.87]This place sucks.
[58:00.69]I don't like this place.
[58:04.74]There better be a train here.
[58:05.66]I don't like this place.
[58:15.10]I don't know where I am.
[58:16.76]Apparently, I'm in the woods.
[58:23.36]Nice Wario Stadium skip.
[58:25.67]Hahaha.
[58:28.31]By the way, my name is just Dave Worker.
[58:31.19]That's so lame.
[58:38.98]Fucking break.
[58:47.23]Checkpoint.
[58:48.07]As long as I get the 25, I don't care.
[58:50.67]I'm going to try doing multiplayer again.
[58:52.09]I can't just sandwich that guy against the wall.
[58:57.35]Why not?
[58:59.99]Next.
[59:00.93]Next.
[59:03.27]You know, I would probably agree with you guys.
[59:05.01]I want to try the multiplayer though.
[59:09.81]Have to get like one multiplayer game.
[59:17.93]Okay, that was fun.
[59:25.29]Great.
[59:25.51]Just get me the 25k.
[59:26.29]Just get me the $250.
[59:26.83]The 25,000 bits.
[59:27.31]150 fucking points.
[59:30.10]Like, there's nobody...
[59:48.82]I'll tell you.
[59:49.40]Here's a flat out.
[59:51.38]I'm going to give you my first impressions.
[59:54.37]First impressions of Flat Out 4.
[59:57.51]This game is probably fun for two hours.
[59:59.91]And then you'll never play it again.
[60:03.19]I had fun.
[60:03.87]The first hour, it's been an hour.
[60:06.19]It's been an hour.
[60:07.00]It's fun.
[60:09.32]I don't think I'll ever play this game again.
[60:14.22]I don't think I will.
[60:16.02]I'm not sure I will.
[60:23.40]fun fun game but like these are all just more of the same right we'll keep the flag that's different I don't even know what that means so these are just more of the same stunt things just a little different 640 is that the next stunt no 460 what is this one I wish I could see what it is
[60:53.31]See if it's worth me doing all this for.
[60:56.87]Stunt.
[60:58.33]Okay, this one has fire.
[60:59.46]Should I try to do the fire one first before I give up?
[61:06.86]Hold on.
[61:07.72]Let's see if anybody like multiplayer.
[61:11.78]Come on.
[61:12.14]One of you guys has to have this game.
[61:14.16]Find game.
[61:15.44]Any.
[61:15.82]It don't matter.
[61:16.50]Just this public game.
[61:23.17]Stunt failed.
[61:24.05]There's only so many things you can do with the racing genre.
[61:29.46]Even, like, the career mode was kind of just more of that.
[61:32.64]Except you just drive around and don't, like, go against anybody.
[61:35.26]You go against, like, the computer.
[61:39.46]This is so funny that, like, nobody has this.
[61:42.79]Browse cars.
[61:47.07]I mean, this is the closest thing to a clown car.
[61:51.59]Ice machine.
[61:54.49]Ice cream truck.
[61:57.85]Yeah.
[61:58.69]I mean, of course.
[62:02.14]I can't be the clown because he's locked.
[62:05.34]The music won't stop.
[62:09.20]Okay.
[62:15.73]Put milk on the game.
[62:19.03]Burnout had tons of shit you could do.
[62:23.21]I'm surprised there's nobody trying to play this.
[62:27.39]Setup, uh, don't matter.
[62:29.48]It's just any.
[62:38.50]There's nobody here.
[62:39.32]How can there be nobody that's playing this game?
[62:49.65]Off to eight players, party mode.
[62:51.51]Alright, eight players.
[62:54.26]Golf, like long jump, billiards.
[62:57.80]This is so cool.
[62:58.66]Look at this.
[62:59.54]I can't wait to play this.
[63:01.09]High jump, curling, stone skipping, baseball.
[63:04.45]Alright, select this one.
[63:08.57]Baseball, rings of fire, and billiards.
[63:13.39]Let's go.
[63:13.71]And I'm going to be Dave Worker.
[63:20.54]What is it?
[63:20.92]I don't understand.
[63:25.28]How do I, like, start the party?
[63:31.22]Aim for the flat-out logo on the bat.
[63:35.32]What?
[63:38.07]Just go quick play.
[63:39.13]I guess I could.
[63:43.57]Well, I overshot that.
[63:47.01]Quick play is multiplayer, really.
[63:55.02]Quick play.
[63:56.84]Like, whatever.
[63:57.30]I don't care.
[63:57.68]Let me just see.
[63:59.34]Go race.
[64:04.34]Are you sure?
[64:05.06]I think this is just offline, isn't it?
[64:11.88]Dave Worker for Jerma Rumble.
[64:17.79]45 people as the all-time peak.
[64:22.12]I don't think these are other people, by the way, guys.
[64:25.77]I don't think these are other players.
[64:26.95]This is Dolores again.
[64:30.31]Going against Dolores Jail.
[64:32.77]And Evasion Bob.
[64:36.39]These are fucking offline players.
[64:43.60]Alright, it was fun for an hour.
[64:47.34]Fun for an hour.
[64:47.92]Now we're gonna...
[64:50.65]Did I already download Lego Undercover?
[64:53.93]I need to like see if I have that downloaded.
[64:58.97]Tax evasion bomb.
[65:00.77]Oh no!
[65:01.37]I'm going over the edge!
[65:05.53]Oh no!
[65:06.19]I'm going over the edge!
[65:11.54]That didn't even work.
[65:12.82]Hold on.
[65:14.90]Hold on just a second!
[65:16.24]Uh, we're gonna be starting soon here.
[65:23.94]Hope you guys had fun for the one hour that this game is worth playing.
[65:30.12]I guess.
[65:31.66]Unless you really, really care.
[65:36.34]Very deeply.
[65:39.25]About throwing your guy out of a car.
[65:43.19]Then you ain't gonna find very much to do there.
[65:45.27]Okay, where is it?
[65:52.92]Uh, I wonder how long this is going to take to download.
[65:57.40]All done.
[65:58.60]Yeah, bear with me here.
[66:01.34]I'm just going to see how long this is going to take to download.
[66:06.28]I'm going to play Lego GTA.
[66:11.97]Back to Karazhan.
[66:13.89]Dear God.
[66:16.15]Imagine.
[66:18.11]Yeah, that was just the joke stream.
[66:19.25]Now, like, the real stream starts.
[66:23.41]I just told the other streamers to play with you.
[66:26.03]Holy shit, this is a big game.
[66:27.59]Oh, man.
[66:28.40]Alright, uh... Well...
