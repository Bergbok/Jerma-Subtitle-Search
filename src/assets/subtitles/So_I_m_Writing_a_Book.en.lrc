[00:05.50]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:07.47]Jerma here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay commentary.
[00:11.95]It's been a while since you've seen Fistful of Frags on this channel, and there's no real reason in particular for that.
[00:19.40]Sometimes you put a game away and you come back to it months later.
[00:22.14]Sometimes you put a game away for potentially years, which I did with TF2.
[00:26.22]I stopped playing TF2
[00:28.58]Oh, back in like 2008 for like 12 months or... You take breaks.
[00:33.31]Point is, you take breaks, you come back to games and you go, well, you know, I forgot about this game.
[00:37.75]This game's fucking sick.
[00:39.01]Yeah, well, that's what happened.
[00:40.09]I'm playing Fistful of Frags again.
[00:41.87]Here's a new map, I believe.
[00:43.57]It's one of the new maps that's currently in circulation.
[00:46.23]It's a train.
[00:47.47]It's all about the trains in Fistful of Frags, apparently.
[00:50.38]A lot of these maps, the newer ones, seem to have trains on them.
[00:53.66]But that's regardless of the point.
[00:55.60]You probably saw the title and you're wondering what the hell this title means.
[00:59.44]What are you, were you writing a book now?
[01:01.77]You wanted to make a game company first?
[01:03.51]Now you want to write a book and then what?
[01:05.59]Next thing I'm going to want to be like an astronaut.
[01:07.15]I'm going to be like, gosh, hey, you know what?
[01:08.35]Today's video, we're going to talk about how I want to be a fucking astronaut.
[01:11.56]And I'm going to go up in the airplane.
[01:13.52]We're going to go flying up into outer space.
[01:15.74]And I'm going to meet some Martians.
[01:17.40]And I'm going to start a family up there on Mars.
[01:19.79]No.
[01:20.57]But this is something I'm actually doing right now.
[01:23.17]I'm in the process of doing.
[01:24.03]I'm writing a book.
[01:25.19]Yes, I'm writing a book.
[01:26.31]An e-book.
[01:27.61]Let's make that really clear, this is not going to be a published book by anybody.
[01:31.94]You're not going to see this on store shelves at Barnes & Noble.
[01:35.16]There's not going to be an image of me on the cover in a three-piece suit with my arm resting on a desk, smiling a giant white toothy smile, and it's saying, like, how to manage your finances with Derma985.
[01:47.04]It's just, yeah, it's going to be something I'm doing for fun, and it's a choose-your-own-adventure book.
[01:54.88]I got really inspired recently by playing that game Sorcery.
[01:58.88]That was a choose-your-own-adventure book.
[02:00.28]I'm sure a lot of you guys remember me talking how into what I was and how cool it was, how I wished more people would be porting over game books.
[02:08.19]And then Inkle, the company that made that game Sorcery, oh well, they ported that game Sorcery over to iOS and Android and shit, they came up with this engine.
[02:16.83]There is an engine that they came up with for you to write your own choose-your-own-adventure books.
[02:22.47]So I saw that and I said, holy shit, are you kidding me?
[02:24.65]This is awesome.
[02:25.61]I gotta give this a try.
[02:26.69]I've got to at least try to do this.
[02:29.10]And yes, I know that there are other resources and other places where you can write choose-your-own-adventure novels and stuff.
[02:34.72]But this, I just knew the company, Inkle, I played all their games, and it looked really easy to use.
[02:40.50]The tutorial was very, very simple.
[02:43.24]And I just started.
[02:44.24]I started writing, and I already have, like, probably, like, at least a few hundred words written so far.
[02:51.36]I don't know what the timeframe will be on this.
[02:54.26]I can't just be telling you, oh yeah, well guys, in three months I'm gonna be having 5,000 pages done.
[03:01.67]I don't know the length.
[03:02.87]I don't even know the subject matter.
[03:04.29]All I know is it's gonna be an absurd adventure where you can go branching in a million different directions.
[03:10.89]I'm gonna make all kinds of just strange references to things.
[03:14.21]And I'm not going to take it that seriously.
[03:16.47]So if you're expecting out of this whole Jerma's writing a book thing that you're going to get like George R.R.
[03:22.27]Martin presents like A Song of Ice and Fire, no.
[03:26.07]This is going to be just me writing my thoughts down and having some crazy adventure game that you can just go on and mess around with and have a couple laughs at maybe.
[03:35.36]With that being said, though, I do want it to be a coherent experience.
[03:39.36]I don't want to just write like a third grader, just like, once upon a time, the princess was rescued from the alligator.
[03:47.80]No, it's going to be a coherent story, and I'm pulling the trigger on it.
[03:52.03]So, in the somewhat near future, you might get a glimpse into some type of adventure-free e-book that I'm going to write.
[04:00.63]And talking about free, talking about charging money for it and stuff, I...
[04:05.36]I don't, no, I don't think so.
[04:07.58]The only reason why I would ever charge money for this thing is if I literally, like, legit put, like, 5,000 hours into writing it, and it was, like, a really big fleshed-out whole thing.
[04:19.72]And we'll just see how that goes.
[04:21.80]I have no idea what I'm doing.
[04:23.38]I have no clue what's going on, which is why this is not a get-rich-quick scheme for me.
[04:29.07]I'm not just gonna say...
[04:30.53]Hey, uh, wow, you know, I could just write a shit book that nobody's gonna like, and I'll just put like a $30 price tag on it.
[04:39.61]It's just an experiment that I'm doing, and that's all I really have to say.
[04:43.95]I just wanted to mention that that's something I'm working on right now, on top of all the other things that I'm doing in my life.
[04:49.14]It's just kind of a life update, what are you doing video.
[04:52.82]And that's gonna wrap it up, so thanks everybody so much for watching, really appreciate it.
[04:56.42]And, but, I want to close this out by saying this, right?
[04:59.75]If you want to try something, like, look, I don't think I'm a writer.
[05:02.83]I don't think so at all.
[05:04.03]I'm not one of those people that, like, I didn't go to school for it.
[05:06.85]I'm not a good, like, writer.
[05:09.52]Who gives a shit, right?
[05:10.66]Just try it.
[05:11.34]Just do it.
[05:12.14]Even if you look at something and you go, you know, I can't do it.
[05:15.02]I would suck at that.
[05:16.68]Try it.
[05:16.94]Just see.
[05:17.60]See if you do.
[05:18.18]Because guess what?
[05:19.04]You might do it and go, holy shit, I'm the next Edgar Allan Poe.
[05:23.59]And it would have turned wandering weak and weary as a topic on my rainbow chamber door.
[05:28.07]You could be, like, really good at it, is what I'm saying.
[05:31.41]And you never know.
[05:32.11]Just try it.
[05:32.96]Even if it's anything, whatever it is, I would say just go for it.
[05:35.54]You know me.
[05:36.08]Just fucking go for it and just bang.
[05:37.94]You know what I'm saying?
[05:38.66]Boom.
[05:39.78]And with that, that's going to wrap it up.
[05:40.98]I'll see you all next time.
[05:41.98]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:43.32]I really do appreciate it.
[05:44.69]And goodbye, everybody.
[05:45.81]Take care and have a wonderful evening.
[05:48.27]Have a wonderful night.
[05:48.95]Have a wonderful morning when you wake up.
[05:50.07]I hope you get a delicious breakfast.
