[00:08.99]Hey, what is happening, guys?
[00:09.99]It's Jerma here again with another gameplay commentary for Team Fortress 2.
[00:13.72]This time I'm playing as the Huntsman Sniper on King of the Hill Nucleus.
[00:18.48]This is not the gameplay.
[00:20.18]This is kind of the beginning.
[00:21.30]I jumped in a little late.
[00:23.07]I'm going to show you the gameplay after this.
[00:24.47]This is kind of just a few headshots and stuff like that, kind of, because I didn't want a two-minute gameplay, so...
[00:29.65]After this is when the actual gameplay starts, but I go on a pretty good run here, get a few headshots, get some good nice long shots.
[00:35.60]You know the deal.
[00:36.74]Huntsman is fun.
[00:37.52]This is the Huntsman, the vintage Jurati, and the Shahenshah.
[00:42.81]And this spy, I knew he was a spy, come around the corner, I just smash him.
[00:46.39]Don't know why he just was standing there, but you know, probably just caught off guard.
[00:49.45]Coming around the corner.
[00:50.97]If you're looking for Huntsman tips and strategies and stuff like that, this is not going to be the video for it.
[00:55.98]I have a video up on my channel using the Huntsman, showing you real strategies how to use it, how to get better with it.
[01:02.39]So I suggest you go.
[01:03.33]I think it was a month or so back.
[01:05.53]Just go search in my channel page.
[01:07.15]I believe it's called Huntsman Tips and Tricks.
[01:09.97]So if you're looking for that video, that's what it's called.
[01:12.54]Now, very, very briefly, I want to talk about my livestream schedule.
[01:16.54]I know that a lot of you guys are going back to school or are already in school right now, so I gotta change my livestream schedule so I don't have to be like, oh, I gotta stay up till four in the morning to watch Jerma, then I have to wake up in two hours to go to school.
[01:30.98]I don't want that to happen, so I'm going to change my live streaming to Saturdays only.
[01:35.94]I'm not going to do it two times a week anymore, guys.
[01:38.50]Only Saturday nights, Saturday evenings at around 6 o'clock Eastern Standard Time.
[01:44.30]I'm sorry if that screws up your schedule that you had when you originally were watching me, but...
[01:49.20]That's going to be the way it is because I know a lot of you guys are in school, so you're not going to be able to do it on the weekdays anyways.
[01:54.39]So that means that today is Saturday, so there will be a live stream tonight.
[01:59.61]Check your local listings because I'm not going to be able to tell you what time it is in Germany when it ends up being 6 or 7 o'clock Eastern Time in the United States.
[02:07.34]So that's going to happen tonight.
[02:08.94]Stay alert on my Steam group because that's the only place I'm going to ever tell you.
[02:11.98]Maybe on my YouTube, but that's about it.
[02:14.22]So let's start talking about the gameplay now.
[02:16.04]Fresh start, three minutes, three minutes, King of the Hill Nucleus, using the Huntsman, the Jurati, and the Chahantcha, like I said.
[02:22.71]Standing still, Demoman gets shot right in his face, and looks like we're going to cap the point.
[02:26.91]I think we get it, actually.
[02:28.11]We do.
[02:29.03]This part is actually kind of funny.
[02:30.73]Scout comes after me with the candy cane, and I think I'm going to get him.
[02:33.91]Oh, what's this?
[02:34.54]Another Scout coming after me, and a Spy.
[02:36.58]This is fantastic.
[02:37.72]Nothing bad's going to happen here.
[02:39.26]Get the kill on the Scout, but I get shot in the face by the other Scout.
[02:44.46]Got our death out of the way right there.
[02:46.08]That's the only time I died during this particular gameplay Let's keep going here roll out of the spawn I was thinking about spamming the point, but it looks like our team has it pretty well secured heavy engineer on the point I don't think I have to stick around here and get myself killed.
[03:00.76]That's a spy I know it you can always tell if a scout is a spy because he's running slower than a scout and watch this
[03:07.62]God, he just like breaks his neck on the wall right there.
[03:10.99]I thought that was ridiculous.
[03:12.55]We only have an engineer sitting on the point right now, so I figured I have to get over here at some point.
[03:17.13]This scout, tracking a scout is the most difficult thing in the world.
[03:20.84]I end up getting him, though, with a nice little track shot.
[03:23.42]You'll see, I turn around, he's coming up the stairs, and I just barely get the shot correct.
[03:28.50]And there we go.
[03:29.20]Me and this engineer got this point pretty much on lockdown.
[03:32.47]Minute and 47 seconds now.
[03:34.63]They still have three minutes left.
[03:36.41]They haven't capped the point one time, which is huge because we're more than halfway there now.
[03:41.90]Probably securing a victory unless they can pull off something really, really crazy.
[03:46.06]Coming around here just to check the perimeter, and I see a Flaming Heavy.
[03:49.72]Guys, your teammates really appreciate it, and you get points for putting them out with a Compression or Jurati.
[03:55.53]So if you don't already do this, please start doing it.
[03:57.92]People really appreciate it.
[03:59.43]This spy right here comes up behind this heavy.
[04:01.12]I'm going to slow it down for you.
[04:02.16]Watch what happens.
[04:03.38]He backstabs the heavy and gets headshot at the exact same time and both of their reactions I thought were so funny.
[04:10.34]I was dying laughing at that one.
[04:14.14]So I come down here shooting near their spawn area.
[04:16.86]I get a couple of kills.
[04:18.25]This is a great thing to do on Nucleus because so many people are just pouring out of this doorway.
[04:22.35]It's such a small little corridor that you're pretty much guaranteed to kill at least one person coming out of here.
[04:28.27]Throw the Jurati.
[04:29.63]Don't get anybody covered with it, but it's alright.
[04:31.85]I end up making this Pyro free Willy off the edge here.
[04:35.08]He falls way down to the depths.
[04:37.94]So I get on the point, turn around, I see a sniper, and I know for a fact he's gonna go to the little spot right there, and I end up timing it right, get the kill.
[04:46.30]That's what's gonna happen.
[04:47.12]If you ever know there's a sniper on this map,
[04:49.01]They're either right in that corner or they're going to be at the top right on one of the balconies.
[04:53.53]That's pretty much every single sniper spot.
[04:56.27]Get another kill for a soldier that was coming for the point.
[04:59.16]And I get another kill on a pyro coming for the point.
[05:01.40]So now there's less than 30 seconds.
[05:03.96]Everybody's here.
[05:04.62]The whole family's here on the point just hanging out.
[05:07.55]DeadRingerSpy activates his cloak, but he's not going to be able to do a whole lot, because there's so many people squashed on the point, he's going to have to bury his way into people, and he probably will end up just falling off the edge, so I'm not concerned about that.
[05:19.79]So slowly we are all creeping up to their spawn door with less than 10 seconds now, less than 5 seconds.
[05:25.50]The game is over with a flawless victory.
[05:28.10]Thanks everybody so much for watching, I really appreciate it.
[05:30.92]Hopefully you show up tonight to the livestream, if you don't,
[05:33.40]That's cool, too.
[05:34.10]I'm glad you watch the videos on YouTube, wherever you watch them.
[05:37.05]Thank you so much.
[05:38.39]Take care, everybody.
[05:39.19]I'll see you all next time.
