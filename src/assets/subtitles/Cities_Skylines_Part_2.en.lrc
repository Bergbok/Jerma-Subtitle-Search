[ve:61.7.100]

[00:01.55]Okay, hello, how are you?
[00:04.81]We're gonna move on to Cities Skylines.
[00:08.98]I gotta change this title to picking up apples and carrots for five hours.
[00:15.09]Doesn't make any sense anymore, so we're gonna name it Back to Wink Dink City.
[00:31.89]Cities... Skylines.
[00:38.33]You didn't play for five hours.
[00:39.95]I played for four.
[00:42.13]So, I think I got my fill of Animal Crossing for the day, and we're gonna do that every day.
[00:47.77]Well, what I mean by that is, with every stream day, we will finish with Animal Crossing.
[00:58.58]So, it's kind of what you can expect.
[01:02.10]At least for the next couple weeks, I would assume.
[01:05.02]Alright, back to it.
[01:06.52]Here we go.
[01:07.00]And... You should be able to see... It on your screen.
[01:14.14]Can you see it?
[01:20.21]Yes, you do.
[01:23.51]Okay.
[01:23.65]So, City Skylines, we're gonna load game.
[01:25.75]This is before... That was very loud.
[01:28.93]Make sure I turn this down.
[01:31.64]uh what would the which one not the auto save where's the one before the explosions it was yes yes it was this one okay so uh but first of all we had a ton of money come in we had 5 000 bits 50 buck drop right now from phylactery lich let me just take a quick sip of water
[02:00.91]They say, hey Derma, you're really bad at making roads.
[02:03.33]Just so you know, you can download pre-made cities just to fuck with them.
[02:06.47]Download a copy of Boston.
[02:08.82]No, I wanna make my own shit.
[02:11.94]I don't want a pre-made city.
[02:15.05]No.
[02:15.69]I want to make my stuff from scratch.
[02:17.85]I don't want to go open up the freezer and go take out a fucking kid cuisine and put it in the microwave for 25 seconds.
[02:23.77]No.
[02:24.67]I want to go get the batter, I want to go get the chicken, and I want to make it from scratch on my stovetop.
[02:29.74]Even if it's easier that way.
[02:31.66]No.
[02:31.78]No.
[02:35.22]And even if this food comes out to be poisonous, and not edible, and... It'll hurt, and people will get hurt if they eat it.
[02:49.54]But thank you for the, uh, 50 bucks, appreciate it.
[02:53.26]Just, uh, let's try to figure out where we were before.
[02:58.00]Change the title.
[03:00.73]This is, man, I got, the title's changed.
[03:02.29]Back to Winkdink City.
[03:07.11]The city is beyond saving.
[03:08.73]Yeah, it was left in a really bad state.
[03:10.91]I gotta work on the trash.
[03:12.54]Forget about the fucking roads.
[03:14.76]We'll do that later.
[03:23.20]Forget about the roads.
[03:26.90]Alright, it's been a full day.
[03:28.94]This is awful.
[03:31.48]Who fucking made this?
[03:39.81]I don't even feel like I did this.
[03:40.92]I think I fell asleep and somebody took over.
[03:45.02]This is working as intended.
[03:55.23]Those of you that were not here yesterday, I made it so the highway, any cars that are on the highway have to go through the toll and go through the scenic Statue of Liberty
[04:08.97]And they have to go this way.
[04:10.53]This is the only way to go on the highway.
[04:11.97]You go up there.
[04:13.57]There's a toll every 15 feet.
[04:17.27]This keeps going.
[04:18.11]Every toll is as high as the price can possibly get.
[04:22.43]And eventually, that leads you to... You can go left.
[04:27.25]Left takes you back all the way around, which will eventually take you down here back to the actual highway.
[04:33.74]This is what happens when you take the highway.
[04:35.70]Or, you can bang a right and come and join our little town here.
[04:39.00]We have a nice little community.
[04:40.40]Okay.
[04:47.23]Okay.
[04:48.98]Oh, man, I kind of don't- I kind of want to just- this is- this- this is bad.
[04:52.76]Alright, we're fine.
[04:55.04]What do I need?
[04:57.48]I- not enough educated workers.
[05:01.18]We need industry.
[05:02.52]A lot of it.
[05:03.06]But we don't have enough fucking workers.
[05:05.72]Not enough buyers for products.
[05:07.46]No, we need commercial.
[05:08.54]Commercial.
[05:08.90]What do we look like?
[05:11.36]Terrible, terrible, terrible commercial buildings.
[05:15.30]Okay.
[05:15.44]Okay.
[05:17.11]Alright, I know what I want to do.
[05:18.75]We are going to build out from here.
[05:20.61]We're going to have some commercial out this way.
[05:25.11]That's the plan.
[05:25.91]That's what I'm doing.
[05:26.49]I'm going to build a bunch of commercial.
[05:29.66]Double roads.
[05:34.68]Right over here.
[05:37.40]What's this?
[05:46.70]Double down on the tolls and legalize weed.
[05:50.16]I want a curved road.
[05:52.50]I want to go like this.
[06:16.21]Okay.
[06:21.29]What?
[06:21.75]Why are there so many palm trees?
[06:25.13]And you gotta be very tall to come in here.
[06:26.69]No.
[06:29.65]Alright, commercial.
[06:31.29]High density commercial.
[06:33.29]Around the whole thing.
[06:38.95]We need more goods.
[06:50.18]Here we go.
[06:50.76]Alright.
[06:51.04]Now this just has to build up.
[06:52.00]I need a ton of industry.
[06:53.70]I need more commercial for industry, though.
[06:57.08]Just keep going down this way with commercial.
[06:58.66]Just make a ton of it.
[07:03.80]Like, this don't matter.
[07:04.40]Just make a bunch of it.
[07:05.41]And then I'll make some industry down here.
[07:06.47]This is all... Is this industry?
[07:07.71]What is this?
[07:09.49]What the hell is this?
[07:12.17]What is this?
[07:12.63]Are these houses?
[07:14.99]Why are they not labeled?
[07:17.87]Oh, it's high density.
[07:19.05]High density.
[07:19.65]Okay.
[07:27.33]I gotta- fuck.
[07:29.49]Wait, how are people gonna go to these businesses?
[07:32.21]There's no way people can go to these- there's a dirt road!
[07:41.80]Are these all gonna be drive-throughs?
[07:52.22]Ahhhh, fuck.
[07:53.74]Just make them houses.
[07:54.64]No, I can't.
[07:55.48]This is fucked up.
[07:56.98]How do I delete this?
[07:58.34]Just delete them all.
[08:01.50]This is the... I can't do anything right here.
[08:07.02]I gotta plan this shit out, too.
[08:08.27]Alright, how does it look over here?
[08:09.51]Alright, commercial building's going up.
[08:11.35]There's plenty of this... Web street.
[08:14.65]Okay.
[08:16.35]Alright, there's enough room.
[08:19.75]That'll build out.
[08:21.79]Then... Oh, we need water and shit here.
[08:34.74]Good.
[08:34.98]Okay, electricity's already here, right?
[08:39.04]Yes, it is.
[08:50.32]Is there electricity here?
[08:52.84]No, no, there's not shit in the water pipes.
[08:54.34]I fixed that, remember?
[08:55.30]I have the cleaning unit here.
[08:59.56]Another 50 fucking dollars.
[09:01.00]Holy shit.
[09:06.90]That's like, this is like three $50 bit drops in a row.
[09:10.18]In the last, like, hour.
[09:13.22]Oh my god, this is from TransScoutTF2.
[09:16.96]Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[09:19.22]Well, me too.
[09:19.52]It makes me want to scream too.
[09:20.32]But I'm really sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis.
[09:48.60]Really sorry to hear that.
[09:51.20]I don't know that much about ALS, but it's manageable from what I've heard.
[10:02.55]Really sorry to hear about it, though.
[10:12.03]At least enough.
[10:13.63]Steven Hillenburg died from it?
[10:16.65]Yeah, that's horrible.
[10:23.50]Unfortunately, it's not managed.
[10:24.72]It's not.
[10:25.36]Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a different one.
[10:26.96]A different illness, but... I'm really sorry to hear about it regardless.
[10:42.32]But yeah.
[10:43.78]Take care of yourself.
[10:45.12]I wish you the best.
[10:45.77]I wish your family the best, too.
[10:56.12]You're probably thinking of MS.
[10:57.78]Yeah, probably.
[11:01.12]Probably.
[11:01.54]But thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[11:09.63]Completely unnecessary.
[11:12.23]But thank you.
[11:13.25]How do I get rid of these houses?
[11:38.87]Okay, I have a question.
[11:40.81]If... If a house is abandoned... Does that... Is that because there are too many... Is that because... What am I doing wrong here?
[11:52.23]I mean, don't answer that question, because very obviously the thing you're looking at right now... Is... That could be one of the reasons... It could be one of the reasons why.
[12:03.58]Don't answer that very immediately.
[12:10.94]I need industry now.
[12:11.98]Oh, fuck those commercial buildings.
[12:13.08]Alright, up, up, up, up, up.
[12:19.72]Industry's down here.
[12:20.36]Alright.
[12:21.46]Let's do a double road.
[12:22.74]I'll work on toll road once this is done.
[12:28.08]Too steep.
[12:28.77]What the fuck are you talking about?
[12:40.84]Alright, industry.
[12:44.25]A lot of it.
[12:51.31]You're making a maze.
[12:52.39]I wish it would stop.
[12:53.33]It's been raining for a year.
[12:54.69]Will it stop fucking raining?
[12:57.45]You don't need more industry.
[12:58.53]What?
[12:59.49]High demand for industry.
[13:04.64]That's what that means.
[13:08.26]The Statue of Liberty is trashed.
[13:12.42]Wait, hold on.
[13:14.71]Garbage.
[13:15.35]Oh, yeah.
[13:16.27]You got a garbage truck.
[13:17.45]I can't get here.
[13:20.79]Wait, is there a garbage truck on the way?
[13:22.59]What's going on here?
[13:36.84]All right, I need a hospital.
[13:41.00]How many hospitals do I... Okay, I don't have any up here.
[13:43.02]There we go.
[13:45.69]Hospital.
[13:47.09]There we go.
[13:47.85]Right here.
[13:50.83]Another one over here.
[13:51.83]I don't have enough money.
[13:55.37]How much is a... Fuck, a hospital's expensive.
[13:59.65]Uh, we'll do this.
[14:00.27]Crematory.
[14:04.58]Wait, that's a hospital for one street?
[14:08.44]Yeah, but they're so disconnected.
[14:09.82]I...
[14:12.10]Remember the ambulance that drove around the entire city?
[14:17.89]Medical clinic.
[14:21.51]There we go.
[14:22.09]Okay.
[14:26.91]I'm just trying to work things out here.
[14:28.18]Alright, what's going on with this?
[14:29.14]This doesn't even need to be here.
[14:33.76]This is pointless.
[14:39.12]What's this?
[14:41.89]Not enough fuel.
[14:43.00]Coal power plant.
[14:44.44]What is... Well, get rid of it.
[14:51.82]No, no, no, no.
[14:52.88]I didn't even do this one.
[14:55.08]I didn't even do this one.
[14:59.95]No.
[15:01.77]What's this?
[15:03.93]Not enough raw materials.
[15:05.49]Wait, we're out of materials.
[15:08.83]Where's the materials map?
[15:10.50]Do I sell all this shit and move it?
[15:23.45]A thunderstorm is battering the city.
[15:26.31]Stay indoors until the storm has passed.
[15:27.99]Everybody get inside.
[15:28.95]Stay indoors.
[15:29.61]Don't come out.
[15:30.13]No, nothing.
[15:32.91]University.
[15:40.57]Oh man.
[15:44.67]Everyone's fine so far.
[15:45.67]We're okay.
[15:47.39]How long does it last?
[15:56.28]What do you mean they can't go inside?
[16:08.56]Why is there no power?
[16:15.45]No, uhhhh.
[16:18.21]Consumption 290?
[16:19.67]What the fuck?
[16:21.37]Where are they?
[16:25.73]How come this is not connected?
[16:34.75]We're good.
[16:45.29]It's because I deleted the power plant.
[16:47.35]Well, it said there was no more fuel, so I deleted it.
[16:56.19]Alright, I think I gotta make a new city.
[16:58.84]I gotta start over.
[16:59.98]I'm gonna make a new city.
[17:00.78]I'm gonna make it better this time.
[17:08.46]Okay, I'm gonna make a new city.
[17:09.76]I'm gonna be quick about it.
[17:22.61]This place is fucked.
[17:25.07]I'm doing another one.
[17:25.97]I'm going to make a new one.
[17:26.67]I'm going to make it smaller and more manageable.
[17:33.09]We're going to do this in... Wow, the snow.
[17:41.89]That would be cool.
[17:42.69]Winter Hills?
[17:50.44]Snowy Coast.
[17:53.55]Do Dust Bowl.
[17:55.98]Two rivers?
[17:58.72]The Dust Bowl.
[18:01.60]This is just green.
[18:02.78]It's always Dust Bowl.
[18:04.48]No, I want to do Frosty Rivers.
[18:06.34]A nice little snow town.
[18:08.17]Yeah, Frosty Rivers is the one.
[18:10.07]That's what I'm doing.
[18:18.57]Change the name?
[18:19.17]I will.
[18:24.41]Wink Dink City.
[18:25.19]I don't know.
[18:25.73]They started eating each other.
[18:35.84]We have a new city now.
[18:41.32]Snowy Crest.
[18:50.91]Here we go.
[18:51.83]Hello!
[18:52.77]Let's start.
[18:53.21]I already know how to do this.
[18:56.63]Okay, so, let's start with... This is the highway to come into the city.
[18:59.83]We're gonna have a nice snowy crest.
[19:03.82]So, this is coming in.
[19:04.76]Let's do... Where's the music, man?
[19:08.40]I want some cool music.
[19:12.38]Rock City.
[19:15.14]Alright.
[19:18.00]Oh, I can't do any of this shit, because I have to level up my city.
[19:20.04]Alright, here we go.
[19:23.44]So, when you come in, you make your way in here.
[19:26.16]And then we're going to have... You know what?
[19:28.91]Come all the way down here.
[19:32.83]We're going to do a straight line all the way.
[19:34.67]Don't be out on this.
[19:36.13]Just wait.
[19:36.47]You'll see.
[19:36.79]There's going to be just a big straight line.
[19:40.95]Pause the game.
[19:45.23]Is that too long?
[19:47.63]Why?
[19:47.89]I was thinking about having to come this way and then...
[19:55.61]So you're going to make it small.
[19:56.74]This is small.
[19:58.10]It's going to be like this.
[20:02.35]Here we go.
[20:02.65]Ready?
[20:30.64]What?
[20:31.72]What?
[20:32.26]What's so bad about that?
[20:36.09]What?
[20:42.17]What's wrong with this?
[20:46.15]These are just little side streets.
[20:47.71]What's wrong with this?
[21:00.18]Make angle.
[21:01.60]The angle.
[21:02.10]What's wrong?
[21:02.92]What's the matter with an angle?
[21:07.68]Don't you slow the fuck down.
[21:11.34]Only do rectangles.
[21:20.98]Look, I'm fucking working on it.
[21:22.53]Gotta go a little further.
[21:26.53]Right there.
[21:44.92]Alright, hold on.
[22:05.67]Go look at a Google's map street view thing and look down and this is what the shit looks like.
[22:22.88]Okay.
[22:23.16]Another one.
[22:24.26]Now.
[22:25.68]Here we go.
[22:26.02]Houses.
[22:26.20]This is all houses.
[22:26.66]All of it.
[22:55.28]This is where the residential is.
[22:58.30]Over here.
[23:00.00]So now we have way bigger roads.
[23:01.56]Okay, so now this is like, we're gonna get out of- Okay, here's like the intersection where we get the fuck out of here.
[23:06.59]And here we are.
[23:07.49]Alright, this is how you get out of here.
[23:09.17]Wait, is this one way?
[23:22.07]And this is where like this shopping area will go.
[23:25.74]Over here.
[24:15.27]He's occupied.
[24:15.97]Okay.
[24:28.94]Christmas tree.
[24:31.10]Rib cage.
[24:33.70]I just want it to be efficient.
[24:43.28]I don't... I don't... I don't... I don't...
[24:46.54]It's efficient because everybody's over here and everyone's over there.
[25:06.95]And we go up here and all the industry is up here.
[25:14.09]Okay, good.
[25:16.01]Up here.
[25:17.15]Maybe some more commercial buildings.
[25:18.83]Over here.
[25:20.00]And then put this up.
[25:22.72]Let me check.
[25:29.16]I got 27,000.
[25:32.86]Here we go.
[25:33.22]This is where the water is.
[25:34.50]This is where the water is.
[25:35.84]I have to explain it to everybody.
[25:40.69]Wait, is it frozen?
[25:47.68]Highway traffic is going down residential.
[25:49.98]Oh, right.
[25:50.62]Fuck.
[25:51.95]I don't... Okay, so here's how we're gonna fix that.
[26:29.10]Now they don't have to go down residential.
[26:30.48]We could do like a rotary.
[26:41.31]Just make it one way.
[26:48.67]Six lane one way.
[26:49.71]Okay, there we go.
[26:53.52]There we are.
[26:56.50]There we go.
[26:57.12]Okay.
[27:00.60]Now they've got a choice You build utilities before you run out of money No money for the infrastructure I got money I got money
[27:31.08]That's too much.
[27:32.42]Right here.
[27:32.86]Okay.
[27:58.37]because I wanted to be able to sit on here from the water.
[28:01.07]Up curving roads and build a power plant.
[28:03.47]What's wrong with curving roads?
[28:22.72]Well, looks like we're doing wind.
[28:28.49]Time for some wind farm.
[28:30.81]Up here.
[28:31.23]Is there a hill or anything?
[28:35.64]Wait, I need wind.
[28:37.76]They gotta be over here.
[28:38.98]Like, right here on the coast, right?
[28:42.60]Eight.
[28:42.78]I need, like, eight, eight, eight, six, seven, six.
[28:49.20]This music isn't very good.
[28:50.38]Well, change the channel then.
[29:01.52]Okay, I don't have any money.
[29:12.99]How fucked am I?
[29:15.65]Wait.
[29:31.67]Really?
[29:31.97]I can't even take out a lung.
[30:05.73]I spent too much money building this out.
[30:07.87]I forgot.
[30:11.27]I'm not softlocked yet.
[30:12.79]Not yet.
[30:13.19]Alright, for the three houses that are here, we're gonna increase taxes.
[30:27.86]It's 200 bucks.
[30:28.50]I'll be alright.
[30:29.54]Okay, now increase taxes.
[30:32.80]I can't increase taxes.
[30:48.67]Fuck.
[30:49.27]I can't believe I fucked this up.
[30:51.46]Can I refund all this shit up here?
[30:53.22]Why did this cost so much money?
[30:54.46]Alright, alright, alright.
[31:02.16]Pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause.
[31:07.07]I don't even have a water pump.
[31:09.63]Okay, I was building as if I was on the last city with like $50,000, $100,000.
[31:12.71]This is only the second city I've ever made.
[31:21.45]Roads are expensive.
[31:23.27]Look, I had like eight hours in the last city.
[31:26.29]We just started a brand new city and I'm building as if I had the money from the last city.
[31:34.58]This is not the third city.
[31:35.78]That doesn't count.
[31:36.32]The tutorial didn't count.
[31:44.64]Or at least these people will be online.
[31:52.54]You can't live without that sweet, sweet, tall money.
[32:01.60]This is so expensive.
[32:03.40]I've got to do it, though.
[32:06.77]How much money do I have?
[32:09.35]This is so fucking expensive.
[32:31.86]Don't worry.
[32:32.26]It's salvageable.
[32:32.89]Hold on.
[32:49.24]Okay.
[32:57.78]We're gonna start generating money.
[32:59.88]Generating taxes.
[33:04.59]Why do they not have electricity?
[33:08.51]Oh.
[33:10.41]Okay.
[33:11.59]Now... Wait, they have to be heated because we're in the fucking goddamn winter wonderland.
[33:47.85]Fucked it up, whatever.
[33:53.96]They use extra electricity.
[33:55.44]Okay, so now, uh, remember, I don't have, like, $180,000.
[34:08.73]I need to build one street.
[34:09.49]A lot of water here.
[34:21.25]We're going small.
[34:22.23]We're going small and manageable.
[34:24.65]We're gonna start with a rotary.
[34:26.49]I can't even build a fucking rotary.
[34:28.01]God damn it.
[34:28.59]Okay.
[34:36.13]Very, very small.
[34:39.93]Connect the freeways together.
[35:06.38]Why did somebody tell me to connect these together?
[35:09.70]Why?
[35:12.14]Why?
[35:20.25]Yeah, somebody did say that, and I was like, sure.
[35:22.25]Alright, I actually kind of like this.
[35:32.31]People come into the city... If they want to fucking... They can... What?
[35:39.35]Go like over fucking here?
[35:44.20]Connect it.
[35:48.90]This is confusing.
[35:51.18]No, they could like go like... Connect it like this.
[35:55.10]You know, fucking whatever.
[35:56.15]You go around in the goddamn... You go around in the goddamn...
[36:07.73]This is fine.
[36:08.41]Because then I can just keep it going this way.
[36:18.66]Truck stop town.
[36:25.91]Goodbye trees.
[36:27.49]I have to... Hold on.
[36:28.27]I have to do this.
[36:31.99]Okay.
[36:33.46]Stop.
[36:34.02]Stop.
[36:34.58]No more.
[36:35.32]Now we're going to make a small little area over here.
[36:40.26]Why couldn't I have used this from the very beginning?
[36:43.84]How come this is locked?
[36:46.23]I want it to be bigger.
[36:58.78]Wait.
[37:00.48]No, no, no.
[37:00.96]I want it to be...
[37:07.80]I want it to be one way.
[37:08.66]There we go.
[37:14.75]Okay.
[37:19.79]And then they come up and they take a left.
[37:24.45]This is why you go bankrupt.
[37:26.37]This is another restart.
[37:27.31]No, it's not.
[37:33.26]Let's make an off-ramp.
[37:38.32]I-I-I have- I can't- I have no options!
[37:43.00]Everything is- everything is ju- okay, now I can do this.
[37:46.72]Why is everything blacked out in the first- I don't understand.
[37:55.87]This was fine.
[37:56.51]Okay, that is fine.
[38:01.91]Play with all- why would I not have everything unlocked right now?
[38:04.09]Like, I don't understand.
[38:09.40]I can't, like, make an off-ramp because I have to do a single-lane road first before anything else unlocks.
[38:23.80]How the fuck do I do this?
[38:37.99]Can I not do this?
[38:41.32]It's in the main menu.
[38:42.28]Well, whatever.
[38:42.90]It's already open.
[38:45.34]Just cheap money.
[38:47.23]It needs to be in the mods menu.
[38:48.99]Oh.
[38:50.67]Alright, well, whatever.
[38:51.39]I'm gonna keep going with this.
[38:54.87]So this is one way.
[38:55.69]I'm gonna make a roundabout up here.
[39:02.41]That's one way, right?
[39:03.21]It is now.
[39:09.32]Okay, roundabout.
[39:13.83]Right here.
[39:20.90]Roundabout over here?
[39:24.32]Why roundabout here?
[39:25.40]Because I want to have people go around and... Roundabout should connect both of the roads.
[39:34.26]Exactly.
[39:34.66]That's what I was going to do.
[39:58.56]Why can't I do this?
[40:07.45]Just do what you want.
[40:13.62]You know what?
[40:13.98]I'm gonna go over here.
[40:14.80]I'm doing this.
[40:15.78]It's gonna be roundabout town.
[40:34.71]How do I get rid of these trees?
[40:41.72]Four lane road with parking spaces.
[40:44.90]That's not what I want.
[40:45.70]This is what I'm talking about.
[40:47.46]Like, what is this?
[41:04.15]I don't want to get overzealous here.
[41:11.83]Okay.
[41:14.20]There's going to be another roundabout in the middle here.
[41:17.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:19.72]That'd be sick.
[41:32.24]No, no, that's too many.
[41:33.02]Too many.
[41:34.08]Way too many.
[41:34.50]They can connect here if they want.
[41:38.03]What do you mean, if they want?
[41:39.01]I can't see shit with these trees.
[42:05.94]Okay.
[42:07.60]You're making crop circles.
[42:08.84]It'll be interesting.
[42:09.52]You'll see.
[42:09.86]Alright, that's enough.
[42:20.09]That's enough.
[42:25.75]It's two people holding hands and leaning back and putting their other hands out in a dance number.
[42:38.54]$50 from phylactery lich.
[42:40.58]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[42:42.00]You know how you took a pottery class for a joke?
[42:43.72]Maybe go ahead and take some city design classes.
[42:45.74]How would I ever do that?
[42:48.48]Play this video game that I've played for like six hours.
[42:59.31]I'm just making fucking roads.
[43:01.86]Like, guys, you, you, this is not your city that I'm making that you're going to live in tomorrow.
[43:09.37]Like, you don't have to live here.
[43:11.41]You don't have to live here tomorrow.
[43:12.45]Like, what the fuck?
[43:15.43]Oh, I don't want to live here!
[43:17.65]You don't have to.
[43:21.05]This is not real.
[43:21.83]This is a pretend video game.
[43:23.80]This is make-believe.
[43:28.94]I'm just kidding.
[43:29.88]I'm sucking you all up in a fucking digital vacuum and you're gonna live here tomorrow.
[43:34.96]Just trying to make you have a little bit more false sense of security for the next few hours.
[43:46.56]Alright, here we go.
[43:47.08]This is rotary side B. Alright, not too much.
[43:56.52]Hey, how many of you guys want to live on B side?
[44:04.47]How many of you guys want to live on A side?
[44:08.81]Let's see.
[44:13.05]Alright, okay.
[44:18.13]Let's get the plumbing here.
[44:18.91]Get it correct.
[44:49.30]Okay.
[44:55.23]I still have money.
[44:56.17]I'm good.
[44:57.45]Put all the garbage on the B side.
[45:04.02]Okay, what about power?
[45:05.12]We need to do power now.
[45:15.04]Wait.
[45:15.72]Okay, I need to see where any resources are.
[45:17.84]I'll just do it across the way here.
[45:23.53]This doesn't matter, right?
[45:35.15]Just do wind?
[45:37.72]A bunch of wind over here?
[45:48.11]Wait, how do I... Is it a bridge?
[45:50.64]Wait, it'll be a bridge, huh?
[45:52.66]Hold on.
[45:54.68]Holy shit.
[45:55.42]Oh, wow, it makes a bridge.
[45:57.72]That's so cool.
[45:58.32]That's awesome.
[46:00.88]Nice.
[46:01.16]Alright, right in the middle.
[46:02.68]Right there.
[46:04.78]Yeah.
[46:06.32]That's cool.
[46:06.76]$18,000. $18,000.
[46:26.17]Kinda cheap for a bridge.
[46:31.21]Okay, no more.
[46:32.34]I need a small road.
[46:33.80]I need power plant.
[46:37.86]I need some commercial buildings, too.
[46:46.23]Um... Where should they go?
[46:48.65]In the middle?
[46:50.53]Yeah, that'd be nice.
[46:52.91]Look.
[46:53.53]Check this out.
[46:55.51]It's like a little street, a little what the commercial shit is over here.
[46:58.17]Go like from here to here, right?
[47:01.21]No, but I don't want the traffic over doing that.
[47:05.52]Click link, please.
[47:10.20]What is it?
[47:12.40]Twitch Viewer Integrator.
[47:16.72]This mod integrates your Twitch viewers to your city's Skylines game and retrieves the current viewer list of your channel when a game is started and loaded and stores them to an internal list of which the names are generated.
[47:41.18]There's three comments on this and I think it's only been downloaded like fucking 12 times.
[47:45.60]This is pretty sure something went wrong.
[47:51.46]How do I know this is working?
[47:52.52]I want to live there.
[48:07.23]Uh... Switch integrator, config... Configure the mod, it's built in config... key value... Mod is based on functional... Alright.
[48:23.14]Stream key stealer.
[48:25.88]No, I'm... Hold on.
[48:27.40]We don't... There's literally not even any houses yet.
[48:34.51]Why did I build a fucking $20,000 bridge?
[48:36.99]I need houses and money and power plants.
[48:40.82]Alright, I'm ready.
[48:41.50]Here we go.
[48:44.76]We're gonna build some wind farm.
[48:48.24]Need some wind.
[48:50.56]No, no, that's too close.
[48:51.72]Eight.
[48:52.20]Here we go.
[48:52.56]Eight, right here.
[48:54.65]Yeah, eight.
[48:55.27]Is eight the max?
[49:00.63]I kind of want all the infrastructure to be over here.
[49:11.98]But... No, give me a power plant.
[49:17.26]19,000 for a power plant.
[49:18.01]Just put it on the road.
[49:18.95]I'll fix this later.
[49:19.77]Just need it on the road.
[49:24.57]It's gonna be just like light industry up here for now.
[49:32.37]Light industry.
[49:35.04]And then, of course, power plant.
[49:39.40]How could I forget?
[49:43.67]go power plant plumbing it's gonna go hmm what how is this flow what's this flow what's this flow is it flow this way so we want the shit to be pumped over here so this is the shit pump
[50:14.36]Alright.
[50:14.94]And then here's the regular pump.
[50:19.40]Right here.
[50:29.18]Why is this doing this?
[50:31.24]This is fucked up.
[50:34.78]Can I get this on here?
[50:35.72]The shit pump's on the side.
[50:37.50]Well, that's... Can I reach this?
[50:43.78]I hope so.
[50:49.50]Yes.
[50:50.24]There's that.
[50:51.47]And then the shit pump.
[50:54.35]Okay.
[50:56.13]We're good.
[50:57.91]Now we just need electricity to come that way.
[50:59.94]And... We're done.
[51:02.24]And I can get my... Town that's ready to fucking roll.
[51:18.38]Power's gonna come down here.
[51:19.26]We just need to wait for shit to be actually built, so I can do it.
[51:22.86]Grab that first city.
[51:44.96]I'm already out of money.
[52:19.24]The water pump is out of-
[52:50.32]It's because of the fucking bridge.
[52:52.06]Why is all this shit locked up?
[52:56.51]Okay, I did the tutorial yesterday and didn't have this problem like two or three times in a row.
[53:01.73]What the fuck?
[53:09.30]Delete the fucking bridge.
[53:14.76]What?
[53:16.97]What?
[53:18.99]How did I lose money by refunding the bridge?
[53:29.54]It doesn't refund?
[53:30.54]What do you mean it didn't refund?
[53:35.22]That's how you do it.
[53:36.30]It says refund on it.
[53:41.44]What?
[53:45.74]It only refunds if no time has passed.
[53:48.29]Oh, fuck.
[53:49.17]I didn't know that.
[53:53.77]What's the cheat to give me like $20,000 right now?
[53:57.63]You can't refund a bridge.
[54:01.12]What's the cheat just to fucking type it to give you $20,000?
[54:06.04]No.
[54:06.90]No, no.
[54:07.66]Save this.
[54:09.52]I'm not going to be under the fucking locked bullshit in the first 10 minutes.
[54:12.74]I've already done all this.
[54:24.65]I don't want like the single lane roads and you can only build this.
[54:30.53]Where is it?
[54:33.57]Editor?
[54:36.75]Assets.
[54:39.89]Content warning?
[54:41.82]Content manager.
[54:43.74]Okay.
[54:45.34]Give me fucking like $50,000 right now.
[54:46.80]This one.
[54:54.93]Custom assets.
[54:59.71]Wait, I can save this.
[55:01.41]Mods.

[55:03.13]Unlimited money.
[55:03.84]Money never runs out.
[55:05.10]Done.
[55:06.18]I'm only going to use it for like five minutes.
[55:11.44]Unlock all.
[55:12.32]Thank you.
[55:16.99]Done.
[55:18.83]Okay, we're good?
[55:22.67]That should be it, right?
[55:26.15]Maybe no.
[55:32.19]That doesn't work?
[55:34.25]All mods are global.
[55:35.03]Activating mod, loading a save game mod.
[55:36.51]Yeah, we're fine.
[55:37.69]Let's go.
[55:50.98]Cheating is god tier?
[55:52.36]Well, I just don't want to sit here and unlock everything again.
[56:01.19]He's scared of creepers, so he turned on creative mode.
[56:04.11]Okay, thank you.
[56:08.25]Alright, unlimited fucking money.
[56:13.66]Build the bridge again.
[56:21.20]Thank you.
[56:26.95]Power on.
[56:27.67]Good.
[56:31.56]This is temporary.
[56:34.74]It's temporary just to get this shit to turn on.
[56:42.50]You in?
[56:44.87]It's not in.
[56:46.91]Okay.
[57:01.17]Alright, there we go.
[57:03.67]That's good.
[57:04.99]Commercial buildings.
[57:10.11]I want to do them right in the middle.
[57:13.59]Uh, what do I want to do?
[57:15.53]Down with the streamer.
[57:16.43]I'm going to turn it off in a second.
[57:17.79]I just need to generate at least like a fucking dollar.
[57:22.00]Center the... I don't care.
[57:25.58]Here, look.
[57:25.88]There'll be businesses here.
[57:29.71]That's cool.
[57:30.29]Alright, then you're gonna have your own little area over here.
[57:32.69]Right in the middle.
[57:33.21]Check it out.
[57:33.73]Watch this.
[57:35.99]There we go.
[57:36.49]Medium roads.
[57:40.55]Four lane road with bicycle lanes.
[57:41.95]I don't know.
[57:42.31]I don't want that.
[57:45.25]I just want a four lane road.
[57:48.69]And... What do I want to do with it?
[57:51.76]Leaders don't deserve respect.
[57:53.76]It's okay.
[57:54.16]I want businesses here.
[58:20.00]I have a broken neck, but that's fine.
[58:23.45]Alright, more houses.
[58:26.25]No, there shouldn't be any houses in here.
[58:27.53]No houses.
[58:28.37]Houses here.
[58:28.85]Around the edges.
[58:44.70]No houses in the middle.
[58:47.15]And then some more... That's fine for now.
[58:51.97]Okay.
[58:54.35]Pause it.
[58:56.77]Connect this shit.
[58:58.01]Not connected, is it?
[58:59.01]Could be.
[59:03.97]Okay.
[59:04.70]Electricity is going here.
[59:07.22]Good.
[59:08.16]Alright.
[59:09.12]Now let me just generate some money.
[59:11.82]And I'm gonna turn off unlimited money.
[59:20.01]Why am I losing money with unlimited money on?
[59:25.13]What are you guys doing?
[59:28.07]Wait, is this bullshit in chat about center the bridge or we're not going to talk?
[59:38.72]Is that what this is?
[59:39.96]This is center the bridge or we're not talking?
[59:41.62]Why are you guys not talking?
[59:42.48]Because you cheated.
[59:43.62]Get out of here.
[59:46.30]Whatever.
[59:47.20]This doesn't matter.
[59:56.63]That's up in my brain right now, don't you think?
[60:01.75]How are taxes?
[60:03.95]Increase a little bit here.
[60:12.86]What?
[60:13.60]What are you?
[60:14.50]What are you?
[60:17.78]Oh, shit.
[60:18.36]Nobody can breathe.
[60:19.54]Nobody can breathe up here.
[60:29.06]Do we have electricity up there?
[60:36.65]Yeah.
[60:40.55]Alright, what's going on over here?
[60:41.39]Build these houses!
[60:45.11]Alright, once I have... Okay, once I get to, like, a nice plus, like, thousand.
[60:50.92]Turn it off.
[60:51.38]I'm gonna turn it off.
[60:52.06]I just want to get this plus thousand.
[60:53.04]I'm gonna turn it off.
[60:53.52]I promise.
[60:55.74]We need to make, like, a fucking hospital.
[60:58.96]Hospital's gonna be right in the fucking middle.
[61:01.74]It'll hit every community.
[61:03.98]Look at that.
[61:05.40]Smart.
[61:07.48]And then we're gonna have... A sauna.
[61:11.89]Oh, I can spend as much as I want.
[61:14.79]Dude, I got a blank check.
[61:17.09]How about a community pool?
[61:19.15]Oh, wow, right in the middle.
[61:21.77]Everybody gets a community pool when you have a blank check.
[61:24.21]It's great.
[61:24.71]Look at this.
[61:27.65]Community pool.
[61:29.42]A community pool over here, too.
[61:33.62]Cheating.
[61:33.90]All right.
[61:34.20]All right.
[61:34.46]All right.
[61:34.72]All right.
[61:34.96]All right.
[61:35.22]Only one community pool.
[61:36.84]And then one helicopter depot.
[61:38.82]No.
[61:40.44]I need a police station.
[61:41.76]All right.
[61:42.10]One police station.
[61:45.18]Police station.
[61:47.36]Hospital.
[61:47.72]Police station.
[61:48.26]All right.
[61:48.76]All right.
[61:49.02]Okay.
[61:49.38]All right.
[61:49.68]Now I'm out of here.
[61:50.28]I'm done.
[61:50.68]A fire station, too.
[61:51.54]Just for free.
[61:52.26]All right.
[61:52.56]All right.
[61:52.86]I'm done.
[61:53.10]I'm out.
[61:53.70]Look at that negative money.
[61:54.90]I don't like that.
[61:59.82]I don't like that.
[62:00.50]Why am I getting negative money?
[62:04.99]And let me do the school too.
[62:07.25]Elementary school.
[62:20.00]And then I'm just at one high school.
[62:23.92]Okay, I'm ready.
[62:28.19]Wait, is the pool costing money?
[62:29.80]Holy shit!
[62:32.34]Wait, what?
[62:36.92]Why is the community pool costing so much money?
[62:41.75]Okay, get rid of the community pool.
[62:43.13]Get rid of the community pool.
[62:43.89]We don't need it.
[62:51.63]What do we stop these fires?
[62:52.75]What the fuck are you talking about?
[62:56.37]You're not supposed to have the community pool yet.
[62:58.21]Yeah.
[62:58.57]It's okay.
[63:06.35]We're going.
[63:13.74]Let's extend this out.
[63:14.94]Let's put this neighborhood out.
[63:16.14]Hold on.
[63:16.66]People are going to freak the fuck out when I do this.
[63:19.14]I know they are.
[63:19.90]No curved roads!
[63:25.91]I'm gonna do a curved road.
[63:27.49]I like them.
[63:36.00]Oh, shit.
[63:37.18]I can't... Yes, I can.
[63:46.90]No, that's cheating.
[63:47.82]That's actually cheating.
[63:48.70]No.
[63:48.88]I just need a baseline.
[63:54.17]That's it.
[64:11.08]Alright, it kind of looks like a moth.
[64:14.77]It's alright.
[64:17.15]Okay, alright, alright.
[64:18.09]More residential.
[64:18.95]I'm gonna do big houses over here.
[64:20.05]I'm not supposed to have these yet.
[64:24.32]Fuck it.
[64:43.65]Stop.
[64:45.45]Stop.
[64:49.01]Stop.
[64:49.19]Stop.
[64:52.29]This is cool.
[64:53.89]This is cool.
[64:57.79]Alright, speed up.
[64:58.58]I need to put... Alright, I'm done.
[65:00.10]Time to put the... I'm gonna...
[65:06.06]Wait for the community to grow a little bit, and then I'm going to actually turn off all the cheating.
[65:12.35]I promise there will be no more cheating after this.
[65:13.99]I promise.
[65:14.43]I won't cheat anymore.
[65:19.43]I promise.
[65:19.99]Oh, we're doing electricity.
[65:29.09]I need more than this.
[65:30.41]I'm going to need to put some shit up here.
[65:34.02]How many M's is this?
[65:35.94]Whatever it is.
[65:50.01]Eight.
[65:50.95]Okay, we can do some here.
[65:51.79]Okay, that's good.
[66:00.15]Fine.
[66:00.37]That's enough.
[66:01.25]That's all.
[66:01.63]I'm done.
[66:05.19]Oh, we need trash.
[66:05.99]Let me just get that done real quick.
[66:07.49]For just a second here.
[66:09.26]We need a dump.
[66:09.88]Dump will be, um... Down here.
[66:12.46]Check this out.
[66:16.30]Oh, we gotta have a place for the dump.
[66:19.22]Six lane road for the dump trucks.
[66:21.86]They can come this way.
[66:24.11]Um... Dump truck.
[66:26.31]Dump truck.
[66:26.77]Where should the dump trucks go?
[66:27.67]Where should the dump go?
[66:28.81]Where should the dump go?
[66:29.43]Where should the dump go?
[66:30.23]Dump.
[66:30.63]Over here.
[66:30.97]Um...
[66:36.89]Where's the dump go?
[66:42.23]It's gotta go on the right side.
[66:55.14]What?
[66:58.28]What happened?
[67:02.64]What happened?
[67:09.08]Okay.
[67:17.06]Okay.
[67:19.26]Good.
[67:20.26]Alright.
[67:20.98]That's it!
[67:27.55]Plenty of room for them to go.
[67:31.49]It's not symmetrical.
[67:32.37]I can fix it, don't worry.
[67:40.09]There we go.
[67:40.45]Okay.
[67:46.79]Hey, look at that.
[67:47.83]Our town is looking a good start.
[67:49.78]It's a good start.
[67:53.00]Now we just fast forward until I can collect enough taxes to not be in the red, and then I turn off the cheating.
[68:04.73]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[68:06.75]God damn it.
[68:17.64]Alright, I'm in the green.
[68:23.23]It's time.
[68:23.67]Turn off the cheats.
[68:38.41]Time to stop cheating.
[68:41.21]Content manager.
[68:42.36]Alright.
[68:43.62]Mods.
[68:45.18]Unlimited money.
[68:46.02]Off.
[68:48.69]Okay.
[68:53.82]Good.
[69:00.04]Unlock all off.
[69:04.24]I can't turn unlock all off.
[69:06.06]I already have stuff that I'm not supposed to have.
[69:08.02]There's stuff that I'm not supposed to have.
[69:12.67]I don't want that.
[69:13.45]I'm keeping it on.
[69:26.73]Another 50 fucking dollars came in.
[69:28.81]Why are you guys giving me so much money?
[69:30.71]This is insane.
[69:32.33]This is like $500.
[69:33.23]Goiki, another 50 bucks.
[69:37.07]If the bridge isn't centered in an hour, I'll... Oh my god.
[69:40.35]If the bridge isn't centered in an hour, I'll... I'll have to go to the hospital.
[69:49.10]I'm a joker.
[69:57.05]What's going on?
[69:57.53]Why do I have this much money?
[70:09.94]That's too much money.
[70:11.50]How do I- Can I donate it?
[70:18.60]Look, I have an idea.
[70:20.59]You- I have an idea.
[70:21.97]Don't worry.
[70:22.57]You want- Here's the idea.
[70:23.75]You ready?
[70:24.91]I have an idea.
[70:32.37]Just make a bunch of expensive shit and then delete them.
[70:35.74]Here, I'll put like five statues.
[70:41.12]Oh yeah, our town has a Statue of Liberty.
[70:44.12]Oh yeah, so does ours.
[70:46.76]We got one too.
[70:48.36]Oh wait, no, we have... We've got the Chirp X launch site.
[70:53.77]Over on our side.
[71:03.42]Wait, who's cooler?
[71:09.73]Wait, this is a spaceship?
[71:14.05]Okay.
[71:15.73]Now I'll just wait and I'll just delete them.
[71:17.45]Why am I losing money?
[71:25.33]I shouldn't be losing weekly money.
[71:27.31]Wait.
[71:28.81]All these takes so much... Okay, when can I delete it?
[71:32.13]Delete it so I don't have to... I don't want to refund 150... Delete it!
[71:36.90]Launch something?
[71:38.60]Launch... I don't have a rocket!
[71:44.92]Pass launch operations.
[71:47.23]Launch preparation.
[71:50.86]Wait.
[71:52.78]Launch a nuke at the other town.
[71:56.36]Okay, I have to get rid of this.
[71:57.38]This whole thing is going to get fucked up.
[72:04.52]Build the rocket.
[72:05.31]I don't have any money, guys.
[72:06.47]This is like end game money.
[72:15.19]Default Windows fucking color selector?
[72:18.71]I have to...
[72:23.14]oh sorry oh yeah I'm gonna have to live with the money all right I'm gonna here's how I do this just okay I'm gonna I could delete this too
[72:47.39]Here's how I'm gonna fix this.
[72:48.53]Okay, so, tax- Everyone's going to live tax-free for like a year, and then I'll be back to normal.
[72:54.35]No taxes for a fucking year.
[72:58.68]There.
[73:05.70]Now build.
[73:16.31]Put a couple of stores here.
[73:17.23]Uh, I want to put... Yeah, I gotta do this again.
[73:26.43]Alright, good.
[73:27.33]Okay, good.
[73:28.45]Let's make some more industry.
[73:29.39]I need it.
[73:31.00]More industry.
[73:33.08]How big are these roads?
[73:33.80]We need some bigger roads here.
[73:37.48]That's too big.
[73:39.64]Uh, four lane road is fine.
[73:45.16]Just make a square over here.
[73:46.58]Okay.
[74:00.13]Industry.
[74:06.13]Good.
[74:09.51]Use your limitless wealth to center the bridge, you... What the fuck are you saying?
[74:19.86]Astrologists report that a devastating meteor will strike the city in the near future.
[74:24.84]Residents should seek shelter immediately if any is available.
[74:36.79]They launched the nuke.
[74:39.29]If it lands over here, I'm going to laugh my ass off.
[74:42.79]B-side forever.
[74:45.02]Why?
[74:45.40]Oh my god, it's actually going to land over there.
[74:50.89]Okay, that's so fucking unfair.
[74:53.77]What am I supposed to do now?
[74:55.09]You just turn off the game?
[75:23.75]Why do I feel like one of you guys did that?
[75:27.13]Like, I downloaded the Twitch integrator and somebody hated this layout so much.
[75:31.81]Fucking double rotary thing.
[75:33.33]He's so stupid.
[75:33.85]The bridge in the middle.
[75:34.55]He wasted so much money.
[75:35.51]He's a cheater.
[75:37.01]Nuke it.
[75:38.77]Wait, this fires.
[75:40.17]I need a fire.
[75:41.11]Where's my fire department?
[75:44.55]Of course, I picked a level with all the trees.
[75:47.84]Fix the bridge.
[76:09.33]There, I fixed the bridge for you.
[76:10.99]Fire department.
[76:11.51]Fire department, fire department.
[76:16.09]Fire department, fire department.
[76:17.67]Fire department.
[76:18.19]Fire department.
[76:39.23]Go!
[76:49.22]Go!
[76:51.34]Get out there and do something!
[76:54.07]Go!
[76:54.43]It's spreading!
[76:55.45]Oh shit!
[77:04.27]Wait, why do we need electricity for the fire engines to run?
[77:09.73]Sorry, boss, we can't go fight those fires.
[77:11.75]There's no electricity in our gasoline-using trucks.
[77:18.52]What?
[77:26.89]Excuse me, um, how did this happen?
[78:10.54]I'm going to make two squares.
[78:13.52]One square on the right, one square on the left, and a small power plant right there.
[78:21.05]And that's it.
[78:31.02]So we're going to build this town over here.
[78:40.77]B side.
[78:41.73]Turn cheats off.
[78:44.01]Left square gang.
[78:52.86]Cheats are on.
[79:35.83]Wait I think I can use this
[80:30.20]Not one way, fuck.
[80:38.71]Okay, that way?
[80:41.35]Okay.
[80:53.97]He's gonna be dead on road, I don't fucking care.
[80:58.43]What happened here?
[80:59.69]Alright, we can fix this.
[81:00.47]Let's clean this up a little.
[81:11.25]That's ugly.
[81:18.20]I want this to be one way.
[81:23.44]If you're gonna go this way, I want it to be one way this way.
[81:27.64]This doesn't make any sense.
[81:32.29]No, what?
[81:33.25]I want to go this way.
[81:43.38]One way?
[81:44.08]Where's one way?
[81:44.74]Highway.
[81:46.16]Highway.
[81:56.10]There's no escape.
[81:59.56]Six lane, one way road.
[82:02.20]So I can't make it go the other way?
[82:06.66]Oh, if you right click.
[82:07.74]Okay.
[82:10.51]There.
[82:17.37]Okay.
[82:17.97]That's fine.
[82:18.75]This is good.
[82:21.46]Why ask if you're not going to read chat?
[82:23.78]I am reading chat.
[82:24.68]How do you think I'm seeing everything you're saying?
[82:26.42]Okay, then this goes down.
[82:31.76]This is alright.
[82:32.48]I don't hate this.
[82:33.70]We can fix this part.
[82:34.58]I feel like a fucking school over here.
[82:53.43]You must have not given a fuck.
[82:54.44]There's gonna be a neighborhood.
[83:25.82]The bridge is not even physically possible.
[83:28.96]Well, it is now.
[83:40.50]Somebody said... This is a Mario Kart track.
[83:53.00]Pause it.
[83:58.59]Okay.
[84:01.93]I mean, this is not horrible, but this has to go.
[84:03.64]This is just too fucked up.
[84:13.34]Maybe this could come over here.
[84:14.96]This wouldn't be insanely terrible if it did.
[84:18.90]Like this.
[84:20.46]And it's just houses.
[84:22.02]Just homes.
[84:23.44]Maybe a couple more that come off of it.
[84:36.48]Uh, actually, I want this.
[84:44.41]I don't want it connected.
[84:45.09]I want it to be a dead end.
[85:08.62]I'm making the J. Okay, this is just the J if somebody dropped a fucking boulder on his head.
[85:52.18]This is too harsh.
[86:00.61]Too harsh.
[86:01.79]Less harsh.
[86:02.49]Make it less harsh.
[86:20.46]I'll keep that.
[86:20.90]That's whatever.
[86:32.04]Okay.
[86:38.36]Small houses here.
[86:39.26]Couple of large houses here.
[86:40.48]This is too harsh.
[86:41.19]Fix it.
[86:48.00]Just make a football, you have the laces already.
[87:08.31]That's shit one way.
[87:25.95]Okay.
[87:27.76]Fix this.
[87:30.40]This shit's one way.
[88:02.35]I want to, like, have this go out.
[88:06.75]This is, like, too fucked up.
[88:08.57]It's got to go like that, and then this has to go over here.
[88:11.10]This is just too fucked up.
[88:16.16]One way.
[88:16.54]Let's do four lane road, but I want it to be one way.
[88:20.87]Can I not?
[88:22.75]Can I only... Can you only do one way roads with six lanes?
[88:26.95]Roundabout.
[88:43.20]How far out do I wanna do this?
[88:56.29]Far enough where I can move this out of the way.
[89:40.30]Clown town.
[89:46.73]Why is this a two-way?
[89:49.29]Where?
[89:52.59]Why is this a two-way?
[89:54.33]Because if you drive down this road, if you live here, you'll have to all- you- you- this is how you get into town.
[90:02.21]Look, I'm just trying to salvage the fucking mess that I made.
[90:10.22]Otherwise, you're stuck here forever.
[90:15.64]If you live here... This... You can never turn left.
[90:19.78]Like, you can't turn left here.
[90:25.09]Ever.
[90:25.55]Unless I get rid of... This is one way to get to the highway.
[90:29.05]This is just for highway only.
[90:30.33]Okay.
[90:35.78]Uh, this isn't straight.
[90:36.74]I know.
[90:37.66]I know, I know, I know.
[90:38.62]But what do you want me to do?
[90:41.02]Now this is, uh... Okay.
[90:46.86]Fucking god.
[90:48.86]No way, I can't even play this.
[90:50.60]I can't even do this.
[90:51.22]I have to delete everything from here on out.
[91:04.81]No, no!
[91:16.13]Why did I have to get fucking bombs dropped on that town?
[91:18.99]It was starting to be fine.
[91:20.19]I was gonna start building out and... This is fine.
[91:32.70]I'll keep that.
[91:33.74]But this shit's gotta go.
[91:34.86]This has gotta be changed.
[91:48.86]because I cheated.
[91:49.64]Well, whatever.
[91:51.92]Okay, this is the houses.
[91:53.22]We're gonna build houses here.
[91:54.34]I'm gonna have big houses here.
[91:57.99]And then we'll have an area where you can go.
[92:00.47]You can go this way if you want.
[92:01.81]We'll connect these two.
[92:05.81]So now you can, like, get access to the fucking wacky bridges.
[92:13.14]More houses over here.
[92:24.30]This will be the commercial center.
[92:26.16]This will be where we do all the... No, this will be industrial.
[92:30.91]No, fuck that.
[92:31.69]There's no way this will work out.
[92:32.89]This has to be industrial.
[92:34.43]This has to be residential.
[92:35.85]Industrial.
[92:36.55]Residential.
[92:37.37]Commercial.
[92:37.97]Residential.
[92:39.27]Good game.
[92:40.37]Okay.
[92:41.09]Cool.
[92:41.53]Good.
[92:44.54]This can be a straight line.
[92:50.66]Why can't I make this a straight line?
[93:08.07]Dude, how do you just make a one-way road that's four lanes?
[93:18.29]Six lanes.
[93:19.65]Six lane, one way.
[93:21.10]Six lane, one way.
[93:22.06]Is there four lane, one way?
[93:23.42]Can you only make a single lane, a two lane, one way, and a
[93:40.39]There's not enough traffic.
[93:41.25]There's not... The highway can do it.
[93:43.09]Because as I said, there's not enough traffic.
[93:46.19]Highway can do it?
[93:46.99]Highway.
[93:49.07]Highway with sound barrier.
[93:50.43]Highway.
[93:51.49]A three-lane, one-way road.
[93:52.93]Okay, yeah.
[93:54.75]Good.
[94:07.90]And now we're going to change this.
[94:13.31]We'll change this out to four lanes.
[94:17.67]As of here.
[94:19.34]But a little bit further out.
[94:29.76]Now you can either go over this way.
[94:39.53]Or you could go this way.
[94:42.24]Wow, you have so many options.
[94:45.08]But you can't... Hold on.
[94:46.04]You can't get in here from there.
[94:54.14]When did I switch to this?
[94:55.72]When I ran out of stuff to do in Animal Crossing.
[94:57.40]Because I have to... A full day has to go by before I can do anything else.
[95:06.38]This has to connect down here.
[95:08.78]It's so far away, though.
[95:16.57]Yeah, I'm killing this.
[95:22.09]This is so fucking pointless.
[95:23.69]Look at how... It would take me like six hours of gameplay to get up here.
[95:28.07]This is impossible.
[95:32.86]I'm putting a rotary right here.
[95:47.70]Should've done that down here.
[95:51.18]Drive all the way down here to get to the rotary that's right here.
[95:54.42]That's so funny.
[95:58.96]I like that actually a lot.
[96:04.77]That's so stupid.
[96:17.36]Okay.
[96:39.50]These are small houses.
[96:41.40]Large houses.
[96:46.27]How much money do I have?
[96:46.85]I'm good.
[96:50.41]Is Football Street gone?
[96:52.03]Um... Yes.
[96:54.37]Because if I- I can't connect it to- This is so huge.
[96:58.91]Look at how fucking enormous these are.
[97:01.17]This is like three miles.
[97:02.67]Okay.
[97:11.17]Then, commercial.
[97:14.42]Low density commercial right here.
[97:18.98]Little pop-up shops right here.
[97:22.09]Commercial here.
[97:22.91]Commercial here.
[97:24.29]Commercial all over here.
[97:29.35]All commercial.
[97:29.99]Commercial.
[97:31.25]It's all like a little fun zone.
[97:34.33]Industry over here.
[97:40.32]Industry over here.
[97:42.73]And now we have our original first layout of our, um, S?
[97:51.20]Um, I don't know.
[97:52.80]Shit.
[97:53.04]I don't know why anyone would go over here, but we're gonna have to figure it out later.
[97:59.03]In fact, just believe me.
[98:02.35]There's absolutely no purpose.
[98:09.97]This is funny, though.
[98:10.87]I like that it's a comedy bridge, so we're gonna keep it.
[98:16.28]So, uh, alright.
[98:17.80]Now, power and plumbing.
[98:28.21]And then, uh, I'm able to at least spend two minutes in my fucking town that I built without a meteor hitting it.
[98:50.64]OK, and then we need over here.
[98:52.10]Pump will be right there.
[98:55.38]Make sure I have enough room for it.
[98:57.56]Whoa.
[98:58.90]OK.
[99:27.04]Alright.
[99:28.04]Cool.
[99:34.30]Electricity.
[99:34.88]I need water pumps.
[99:37.98]I actually need to have the pump... Wait.
[99:39.35]Where's it going?
[99:39.83]This way?
[99:41.01]Down this way.
[99:41.55]So I have to have the shit over here.
[99:46.17]Over here.
[99:49.09]And then the actual water pump over here.
[99:55.56]but wait why is this not taking water is it not in not wait hold on is it not in there that's in there right no not there we go is this one in there
[100:37.30]No, it's just the drain pipe.
[100:39.54]Okay, let's go.
[100:44.74]Connected to anything, don't matter.
[100:45.72]Connected to anything, don't matter.
[100:50.05]Alright, here we go.
[100:51.77]Electricity time.
[100:55.45]I know it's for free, but people are gonna get really mad at me.
[100:59.55]Oil.
[100:59.77]There's no oil in this whole map.
[101:03.05]We're gonna do coal.
[101:03.57]We're gonna do coal and wind.
[101:07.21]And the industry section over here.
[101:08.61]Alright, and wind.
[101:14.71]Water, wind.
[101:15.85]Is that better?
[101:20.47]Okay.
[101:37.66]What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[101:38.46]What do you guys want to do tomorrow?
[101:41.81]What's the plan tomorrow?
[101:53.07]I should have started getting built up before I do this.
[101:54.73]Did somebody just say Dark Souls 2?
[102:07.21]Alright, come on.
[102:08.93]Let's go.
[102:15.38]I'm not gonna play Dark Souls 2 tomorrow.
[102:19.54]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[102:28.37]There we go.
[102:29.23]Connect this to here.
[102:35.39]And then connect this temporarily over here.
[102:38.88]Temporarily over here.
[102:40.96]It's just temporary until everything gets built.
[102:45.22]Is your electricity being used?
[102:47.08]Here we go.
[102:47.50]Here are the houses.
[102:49.91]Nice.
[102:51.15]Power is coming in.
[102:52.27]No, it's not connected.
[103:05.45]in?
[103:05.89]You in?
[103:06.33]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[103:09.25]Consult the list?
[103:10.11]Yeah, there is a pretty significant list of stuff to do.
[103:15.35]These are not connected.
[103:16.19]I rarely do it.
[103:19.28]Alright.
[103:21.88]Hey, look at that.
[103:23.08]Our town makes even 10% sense.
[103:28.96]Our car's not coming in.
[103:48.35]Nobody wants to live in Clown Town.
[103:52.01]Hey, rent is fucking pretty cheap in Clown Town.
[103:54.25]Alright, build up.
[103:59.17]Let's go.
[103:59.97]Build it up.
[104:04.86]Wear a helmet.
[104:08.20]Back this bridge.
[104:11.50]Well, not bridge.
[104:12.10]Use this thing.
[104:13.96]Okay.
[104:17.58]Okay.
[104:19.37]Now we just wait for our city to build up.
[104:31.29]What about... Oh, no schools.
[104:32.35]Right.
[104:32.61]Schools, schools, schools.
[104:34.73]Where should the hospitals be?
[104:38.99]Elementary school.
[104:39.82]Okay, right.
[104:40.66]Somewhere in here.
[104:41.22]A lot of children to teach.
[104:46.74]And we'll do one over here too.
[104:50.44]Over on the corner.
[104:52.18]Well, right here.
[104:54.95]And then a high school.
[104:58.85]High school reaching into here.
[105:04.79]It's just somebody's house.
[105:06.55]Whatever.
[105:07.03]I just don't think your direct neighbor is a fucking high school.
[105:18.22]You can like mow on your lawn and there's just kids out there going to class.
[105:30.01]Okay.
[105:33.25]That's normal in real life.
[105:36.66]Well, no, not like... High schools are usually in their own little areas, in their own little campuses.
[105:43.19]If you live on Heather Jackson Street, and your neighbor is a high school, and the neighbor next to you, that... Let me know.
[106:05.40]no high school was literally like that there are houses across the street from high schools there's a high school literally across the street I can hit it with a slingshot don't do that he went to a ritzy high school
[106:32.41]He's so coddled and so spoiled.
[106:35.37]He went to a high school with like a cafeteria McDonald's.
[106:38.23]There was a Wendy's in his high school too.
[106:40.85]Did you know that?
[106:41.69]Oh, this motherfucker here.
[106:43.02]He was homeschooled.
[106:54.44]Yeah, cry to your butler.
[106:58.29]No, I- I did- I did not- Alright, I'm gonna defend myself here.
[107:01.79]I did- I did not go to a fuckin' school like that.
[107:06.65]I went to a fuckin' public school, and that public school that had fuckin' those little shitty milks that nobody liked, and those little cups of juice that were always icy, the ice was- they were fuckin' frosty, and they weren't even juice, it was like slushy.
[107:18.67]I kno- Would I know that shit?
[107:20.59]There was- I didn't have any of that.
[107:24.48]Those gross cups.
[107:31.05]Don't talk to me like I don't know what I'm talking about.
[107:34.71]Just because my school happened to be set back in a larger driveway.
[107:40.63]Sorry.
[107:47.75]I did not go to a private school.
[107:49.78]What the fuck?
[107:52.90]Even if you do, who cares?
[107:54.10]I did not go to a private school.
[107:58.50]I went to a public fucking school.
[108:04.39]Homeschooling is private.
[108:06.31]You fucking guys.
[108:10.20]You brought your own lunch to school?
[108:11.84]No, I got to- I- I got to fucking steak them.
[108:16.74]That weird mystery meat with cheese on it that they put in a sub roll and gave it to you?
[108:21.05]I ate that like fucking two days a week, three days a week.
[108:27.46]There was, like, these gross meatball subs you could get every day.
[108:31.04]Or, like, the... The, like... Fucking... 90-cent steak-em sandwich thing.
[108:37.00]He got steak!
[108:40.40]No, you don't understand.
[108:49.31]Surf and turf school lunch.

[109:03.43]Catered lunch?
[109:05.03]Yeah, that's what a lunch is.
[109:06.09]It's fucking catered.

[109:11.02]With their expertise.
[109:12.76]In... I don't know.
[109:22.29]Why is nothing being built up here?
[109:28.09]You guys are fucking crazy.
[109:33.66]Billionaire child.
[109:36.10]No.
[109:38.12]This is working out pretty well.
[109:54.68]I'm fucking hungry now.
[109:56.98]All this talk about expensive lunches has made me want to go eat a lunch.
[110:02.09]At 10 o'clock at night.
[110:10.29]I got a lot- I got some stuff in the fridge.
[110:16.77]What is this?
[110:19.99]Don't make him hungry, he'll leave.
[110:28.68]Why did you make this?
[110:31.13]Why did you make this?
[110:32.15]Can I even show this on stream?
[111:02.69]I love the little smile that you gave me at the end there.
[111:06.33]Look at the smile.
[111:07.61]See that?
[111:09.09]I caught that.
[111:09.56]Alright, imagine exporting that and being like, yeah, that looks good.
[111:20.50]Uh, this streamer getting, uh, toilet water shot in his fucking mouth.
[111:23.99]Ah, render.
[111:26.55]You have to watch every frame of that as it renders.
[111:33.97]That's pretty good.
[111:39.40]Oh, that's fucking disgusting.
[111:43.96]Not using a render farm.
[111:45.68]Oh, mega lull.
[111:49.97]Oh, we've got activity.
[111:51.05]We've got activity.
[111:51.81]Okay, what do I want to do now?
[112:02.95]Finally, people are coming in.
[112:03.83]Alright, now we need to buy, like, a park.
[112:06.38]How about here?
[112:15.10]Playground.
[112:16.48]Park with trees.
[112:21.65]This would be cool.
[112:22.35]Right here.
[112:25.73]Double park.
[112:26.95]This is Park Avenue.
[112:29.19]Here.
[112:29.87]Parkway.
[112:31.93]Six Lane Road is the name?
[112:33.41]No.
[112:34.21]Parkway.
[112:43.14]Froggy Street.
[112:43.94]Alright, how about, um... We need, like, a police department here.
[112:46.10]And then we need a... A prison.
[112:57.06]Off the highway.
[113:06.03]How about another prison?
[113:07.09]Two prisons back-to-back.
[113:11.25]Oh, I see power and shit.
[113:26.88]What the fuck just happened?
[113:30.12]Hey!
[113:33.80]Okay.
[113:41.09]How many people are in prison?
[113:42.99]Zero.
[113:48.87]I don't think that's going to fill up very much.
[113:50.18]Alright, I need a... Yeah, we need firefighters.
[113:53.84]Right here.
[113:55.34]How far do they go?
[113:57.78]Eh, put them over here.
[113:59.40]That's better.
[114:01.26]And then a hospital.
[114:02.04]A hospital can go here.
[114:05.10]Should be... Alright, right here.
[114:07.62]Hospital way.
[114:19.36]Okay, good.
[114:22.38]Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
[114:26.04]What's costing so much money?
[114:27.22]Money?
[114:27.44]Yeah, right.
[114:28.16]Wait, taxes at zero?
[114:29.26]How much is it?
[114:36.17]Prison's 2,400 bucks a week?
[114:50.32]Okay.
[114:51.02]Uh, that's way too expensive.
[114:51.98]Of course they're not gonna like that.
[115:19.81]What's it still costing?
[115:21.07]5600 bucks a week.
[115:22.29]Where's my spreadsheet?
[115:26.38]Where's the spreadsheet for the budget?
[115:29.36]The fuck is taking so much money?
[115:33.16]Weekly police department expenses.
[115:34.96]What?
[115:35.14]What are you talking about?
[115:50.66]This game is so fun.
[115:53.60]Now, I imagine a world where you're not a total fucking idiot.
[115:58.12]And can make interesting cities and towns and stuff.
[116:06.94]I'm not a right-brained person at all.
[116:09.91]In fact, if you were to take probably a brain scan of my brain... The middle part with like the left and right of your brain... You know, you get the two hemispheres.
[116:18.95]Left brain, right brain.
[116:21.77]The line in the middle would be... It would be like one slice of cheese length for the right brain.
[116:31.39]All of it, the rest of it, would be left brain.
[116:36.32]It would be like one Kraft Singles thickness of how much I have for right brain.
[116:43.60]Right brain is... Wait, is that the other way around?
[116:48.17]Which is the one that's like your, like, math and logistics and logic and shit?
[116:53.08]Is that right or left?
[116:58.64]That's left.
[117:05.85]Cheese brain.
[117:07.63]That proves your right brain.
[117:09.33]What?
[117:10.13]Hold on.
[117:11.15]Right brain or left brain?
[117:12.79]I actually want to know.
[117:17.80]What's the difference?
[117:18.38]Left brain versus right brain.
[117:19.42]Okay.
[117:22.18]Alright, left brained is like math and... Hold on.
[117:28.99]Right brain is expression, emotional intelligence, and imagination.
[117:32.81]Left brain is language, numbers, and analytical thinking.
[117:35.89]I'm right brained, motherfuckers.
[117:40.21]Here are my... My emotion.
[117:43.63]I'm an incredibly emotional person.
[117:46.75]And I can make up fucking animals in my head.
[117:50.91]How about this one?
[117:53.73]A giborf.
[117:54.37]That's a giraffe and a hippopotamus together.

[152:36.89]Wait, are the mascots riding the ride?

[155:14.33]You're the cleaner at Frank's fish stick factory.
[155:17.43]We've been making the best in mobile phones for over 20 years.
[155:21.04]How did we get there?
[155:21.80]By putting ringtones in every commercial that make you think your phone is ringing.

[156:36.44]I like going to Six Flags.
[156:37.76]I like Disney World, whatever.
[156:40.16]But these rides are only designed to make you feel awful.
[156:45.38]They're not fun.
[156:46.76]They just only are made to make you feel like shit.
[156:52.32]They're not fun.
[156:55.14]Humans aren't supposed to be doing this.
[156:59.06]You don't see the lions in the animal kingdom fucking swinging around in circles.
[157:04.70]Like this.
[157:05.04]We're not supposed to be doing this.
[157:15.55]No, they would not if they could.
[157:17.87]Your organs are not designed to be swam around like this.
[157:22.91]It's not supposed to be.
[157:24.53]It's not supposed to be like this.
[157:27.53]Your kidneys like smush into each other when you're on a ride like this.
[157:45.24]When is it your turn?
[157:50.12]Alright.
[157:53.36]Give me a second.
[157:54.86]I've got something very important to do.
[158:47.29]I'm just trying to make as much noise as possible.
[158:51.42]Where'd you go?
[158:51.88]I'm just still waiting.
[158:57.40]How long does the- Okay, hold on a minute.
[158:59.60]How long does the pendulum ride last?
[159:04.04]This thing has been spinning for like three weeks.
[159:06.06]These people look dead.
[159:16.14]Does it stop?
[159:25.11]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where are you going?
[159:44.70]I can't even click on you guys anymore.
[160:03.30]You're waiting to get on the pendulum ride.
[160:16.51]There's two people on it?
[161:05.81]Alright, I'm outta here.
[161:06.63]Goodbye.
[161:07.45]See you guys.
[161:08.43]See you guys tomorrow.
[161:15.10]I'm gonna get some food.
[161:17.66]See you tomorrow for... Fucking mystery game.
[161:20.62]Who knows what it's gonna be.
[161:22.20]Actual mystery game tomorrow.
[161:24.11]And then Animal Crossing before the stream turns off.
[161:29.13]See you tomorrow for the mystery game.
[161:31.45]Spin that wheel, could be anything.
[161:34.92]It's gonna be an actual mystery, because I don't know either.
[161:43.25]McChicken review?
[161:44.65]No.
[161:46.83]This game is so much fun, I just... I'm not capable of doing anything that makes any sense.
[161:52.03]This is very fun for the last couple of days, though.
[161:55.51]Maybe if I really sat here and, like, studied, I'd be able to do it.
[161:58.79]But it's so much fun.
[162:01.17]This is a great game.
[162:02.39]Hope you guys like it.
[162:07.22]Double the disaster rate.
[162:12.33]It's so hard for me.
[162:13.59]I think it's hard for people that aren't smart.
[162:19.25]Or is it just hard for people that are stupid?
[162:21.61]Or, no, it's hard for people that don't put the time in necessary to learn all the mechanics.
[162:26.84]Thanks, dude.
[162:27.28]No, no, no, no, no, shit!
[162:31.33]No, no, I gotta fix that.
[162:33.97]No, no, no, no.
[162:36.19]Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it.
[162:38.29]Hold on let me fix it.
[162:38.77]Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it. Let me fix it.
[162:43.33]Just hold on.
[162:44.45]That's not what I meant.
[162:46.28]I meant to say was talk about me, not you.
[162:53.52]See you guys tomorrow.
[163:00.09]What was that?
[163:00.57]I don't know, I think something was wrong with your computer.
[163:02.87]You should do a fucking virus game with Mawarabytes.
[163:05.60]I'm sure you'll get some potentially unwanted programs.
[163:09.42]Or PUPs.
[163:10.02]See you tomorrow.
[163:17.04]We're gonna do the bits.
[163:22.26]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[163:24.23]And there'll be a mystery game tomorrow.
[163:26.05]That's right.
[163:26.69]Fucking mystery.
[163:28.97]See you soon.
[163:29.83]Thanks for watching.
[163:30.37]Thanks for sticking around.
[163:34.66]Fish in Animal Crossing.
[163:35.82]I will.
[163:36.22]Don't worry.
[163:36.54]Tomorrow night, we're gonna hang out for, like, probably at least an hour or two.
[163:40.32]And just play it to end the stream.
[163:45.15]I need to go get food.
[163:50.18]Anyways, um, we had... I think I missed this earlier, but Reobate gave 10 community subs earlier.
[163:56.16]I think I missed it.
[163:57.80]I always hate missing those.
[164:00.44]Thank you.
[164:02.28]Pixel Mike, thanks for the 500 bits.
[164:04.20]You sound insane today.
[164:05.40]Are you okay?
[164:05.98]I think, like, one or two people in the stream asked that.
[164:13.03]Does that mean that I'm insane every day?
[164:14.87]I don't know.
[164:17.33]I think I'm fine.
[164:17.89]I think I'm normal.
[164:18.83]I'm a normal person.
[164:20.79]I ride my bike.
[164:23.45]I eat scrambled eggs just like you.
[164:26.75]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[164:29.36]Jeremy, if it makes you feel any better, I named my island The Island.
[164:32.74]This is Animal Crossing.
[164:34.38]Never good at naming my towns.
[164:35.62]Don't want to sit there for hours trying to think of a name.
[164:38.16]I'm not very good at it either.
[164:43.34]I'm not good at it either.
[164:46.44]But I do like Salted Prest.
[164:48.30]What's the name of the town?
[164:52.35]I have no idea.
[164:54.19]I already forgot.
[165:00.01]What's the name of the town?
[165:00.99]Saltcrest?
[165:02.11]Yeah.
[165:04.77]Thanks for the 250, Hayley.
[165:07.05]And I'm also bad at naming things.
[165:09.87]Sukhoi Flanker, thanks for the 500 bits.
[165:12.37]Hello, Jeremy.
[165:12.93]Wanted to apologize a bit late, though, for pressuring you to play Stalker.
[165:16.43]I was drunk, like right now.
[165:19.76]It's all good.
[165:20.82]It's all good.
[165:21.26]Remember, you cannot buy... You cannot buy me anything.
[165:26.06]You cannot make me play something but money with a monetary purchase.
[165:33.26]Flanker.
[165:38.50]I do appreciate the insane amount of money you gave.
[165:41.62]Although it's completely unnecessary, but thank you.
[165:43.42]I hope I use it well.
[165:49.25]Thanks for the huge money, as always.
[165:53.85]Oh, so you draw the Joker on your shirt, but you don't draw my fursona.
[165:57.18]Let's see who that is.
[165:58.30]Fuck you, Jeremy.
[165:59.58]Flick you.
[166:01.30]Flick you.
[166:03.08]I'm never gonna draw a fursona.
[166:05.24]I'm never gonna draw somebody's fursona.
[166:06.74]It's not gonna happen, unless it's mine.
[166:10.49]Which is not gonna happen either.
[166:13.57]I'm never gonna do that.
[166:14.87]I'm never gonna do it.
[166:16.19]I can't, I can't, how many, I'm never gonna do it.
[166:18.55]Ever.
[166:18.97]Ever.
[166:19.39]Ever.
[166:20.96]Thank you, though.
[166:24.54]He has one to draw, confirmed, whatever.
[166:27.80]I don't.
[166:28.66]Shadows1, Disciple, thanks for the $2.50.
[166:30.68]Based King, based Stream King.
[166:33.80]Heard this new team already has millions of fans.
[166:37.13]The Cincinnati Clowns.
[166:38.83]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[166:42.12]It's true, though.
[166:42.88]I would watch every single game if they were a bunch of clowns that played football.
[166:47.83]Or baseball or something.
[166:49.61]Wouldn't you go there and cheer them the fuck on, even if they were zero in a hundred?
[166:54.81]If they lost every single game, I wouldn't even care.
[166:56.87]Who cares?
[166:57.43]I'm seeing a lot of no's, and it's... I can't believe it.
[167:06.27]I can't believe that you guys would not go support the Cincinnati clowns.
[167:12.20]Full baseball team, where they're in full clown makeup and full clown costumes.
[167:16.00]They just play regular baseball, though.
[167:19.21]And sometimes, like, the pitcher will, like, take out, like, a magical scarf before he throws a pitch.
[167:24.69]Like, with a magician thing in the hands where it comes out a million times.
[167:28.37]And he throws the ball.
[167:30.13]I guess that wouldn't be a regular baseball game, then.
[167:36.83]Oh, that would be so funny.
[167:37.99]I would... I would...
[167:40.81]If I ever had, like, hundreds of millions of dollars and I could rent, like, a movie studio or a TV studio, I would make a TV show where there was at least one segment where the Cincinnati Clowns were just in the background playing, and it was just there.
[167:54.48]It's not even really addressed, it's just, they're there, like, somebody gets a fucking home run, somebody falls down and shit, and there's, like, car-tartoon noises, and it would just be in the background, and you wouldn't even know it was there.
[168:07.60]How can I just have a fucking hundred million dollars?
[168:14.95]You're a sucker.
[168:16.49]But what?
[168:19.39]Anyways, let's look at their logo.
[168:29.72]This is a hockey team, apparently.
[168:40.10]That's pretty good.
[168:41.14]That's very good.
[168:44.46]Thanks for the 250 though.
[168:46.54]A dragon breath thanks for the 250.
[168:48.24]So that bot spam earlier linked to some guy's stream playing Fortnite.
[168:52.10]I went to look and the guy seemed to have no idea what was happening.
[168:55.41]Everyone just started harassing him and saying awful shit.
[168:57.59]His viewers jumped from 2 to 200 when the spam happened.
[169:00.07]So I can only assume that harassing was coming from this chat.
[169:02.91]Just wanted to let you know and make clear members of chat that they should probably not do that.
[169:06.65]It was like a targeted bot campaign.
[169:10.05]That's fucking horrible.
[169:14.45]Why would you do something like that?
[169:15.77]That doesn't make any sense.
[169:17.77]Were you just, like, spam something, like, as if it was them doing it or something?
[169:22.53]I don't know.
[169:23.05]That's unfortunate.
[169:24.36]I feel bad.
[169:30.68]That's too bad.
[169:36.29]No, it was not big, thick ass.
[169:38.59]I forgot I said that.
[169:42.55]I didn't do it, Papa.
[169:43.43]I swear.
[169:43.89]You better not have.
[169:44.51]I would be fucking upset about that.
[169:45.75]Leave people alone.
[169:54.82]Yeah.
[169:55.72]Yeah, less than chump change and you get more from fish or bugs.
[169:58.92]Yeah, I remember I talked- I- We brought it up.
[170:02.50]I know.
[170:03.28]Oh, I know.
[170:05.41]Oh, I know.
[170:08.62]Now I sold like 300 of them.
[170:10.76]They'll come back.
[170:11.30]There'll be plenty of weeds tomorrow.
[170:12.34]Don't worry.
[170:12.78]We'll get them.
[170:14.28]Thanks for the 1,000 bits, though.
[170:16.31]Two scoops, thanks for the 250.
[170:17.81]Fireman, they say.
[170:18.87]Fireman's great.
[170:20.19]Two scoops, again, 250.
[170:21.27]If there's ever a villager you don't like, you can always harass them by hitting them with your bug net until they get mad enough to want to leave.
[170:27.89]Try it.
[170:28.21]It's fun.
[170:31.79]I don't want to do that.
[170:32.41]What's wrong with you?
[170:41.62]Rock writing, thanks for the 300 bits.
[170:46.86]And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand, and then rain descended, and the floods, and the winds, and beat upon that house, and it fell.
[171:04.30]And great was the fall.
[171:06.84]What is this?
[171:07.26]Is this the Bible?
[171:11.00]I don't remember there being a fast car speeding through the Bible.
[171:15.23]But, apparently.
[171:17.27]It's Bible prophecy.
[171:18.67]Oh.
[171:22.00]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 250.
[171:23.40]Time traveling in Assassin's Creed.
[171:27.30]Time traveling in...
[171:30.87]Oh, you motherfucker.
[171:34.51]I was thinking about it.
[171:35.63]Then I thought...
[171:54.45]Animal Crossing's a game that you can't really just play once and be like, oh, that was fun.
[171:59.19]Bye.
[171:59.69]Turn it off.
[172:01.84]If you want to play it, you have to play it over the course of at least a week or two.
[172:05.60]You have to just give it the time.
[172:07.82]So, it makes a lot more sense instead of just skipping time and streaming it for like six, seven, eight hours and being like, oh, it was cool.
[172:14.40]We'll do it again some other time.
[172:16.89]Just play the game the way you sleep.
[172:20.71]Your character gets up in real time.
[172:22.01]And here it is.
[172:22.45]It's 8, 9, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock p.m.
[172:25.11]Pacific at night.
[172:25.79]And we're just going to do it for like an hour each night.
[172:28.59]We're going to log into it every... Right now.
[172:33.80]Like these parts of the streams is when you'll see it.
[172:37.92]And I'll just be looking over at the dashboard and reading bits and stuff while we do weeds and pick up stuff.
[172:44.78]It should be nice and chill.
[172:47.43]Thank you.
[172:49.13]Hey, big thick ass, thanks for the 300 bits.
[172:51.23]Good stream, son!
[172:52.53]This was a wonderful family reunion.
[172:54.56]It went way better than that Thanksgiving stream.
[172:56.34]Most because I didn't have to see your uncle Lou in person.
[172:59.58]Next time though, please don't say my username out loud.
[173:01.60]P.S.
[173:01.88]This really is your dad and not some guy named Tingy.
[173:07.98]You guys are fucking crazy.
[173:13.98]Hey, time for a high five.
[173:15.16]Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[173:18.30]$15 for time for a high five.
[173:20.40]You're my 18-year-old cat's favorite person.
[173:23.38]More than me or my husband.
[173:25.40]She watches you all day.
[173:27.42]Thanks for making my husband and I laugh constantly.
[173:29.51]Cheers.
[173:29.87]Aw, that's nice.
[173:33.91]Little cat.
[173:37.75]Little cat.
[173:38.57]18 years old.
[173:39.39]That's a... That's an old girl, huh?
[173:42.33]18. 18.
[173:46.26]God-lover.
[173:47.90]Right?
[173:54.52]That's great.
[173:55.00]Thank you so much.
[173:57.12]Thanks for the $15.
[173:57.94]Uh, hey.
[174:04.25]Thank you, Yifeyboy, for the $4.
[174:07.51]Can't wait to see how you screw this one up.
[174:11.89]It's alright.
[174:13.85]Frozen Crazy Tuna, thanks for the 500 bits.
[174:16.09]Jeremiah, I was wondering if you would load up Dark Souls right now with a new game and rush Pinwheel to prove that it's an easy boss.
[174:21.43]I've been a big fan of yours for years.
[174:23.93]I don't even know how to get there.
[174:26.25]I don't remember how to get there.
[174:29.24]I have absolutely fucking no idea.
[174:32.22]I will humor you here.
[174:33.10]I'm gonna humor you.
[174:34.84]Humor you.
[174:35.42]I'm gonna humor you here.
[174:37.56]If Dark Souls is installed right now, I'll do it.
[174:43.77]It is not.
[174:44.95]Sorry.
[174:48.21]I do not have Dark Souls installed.
[174:49.97]It would take probably 20-30 minutes to install.
[174:57.00]He knew it wasn't installed.
[174:58.18]I didn't.
[175:02.44]Because clearing out and uninstalling your Steam library is like cleaning your room.
[175:08.31]I'll prove this to you.
[175:10.59]Go to your Steam and find out a game that you have installed that you may not have opened in probably six or seven years.
[175:16.99]Let's see.
[175:17.87]Installed games.
[175:19.20]Okay, just to show you, Grand Theft Auto 3 is currently installed on this computer.
[175:23.20]I don't know why.
[175:28.48]Did I buy this recently?
[175:30.04]Has this been installed for like three years?
[175:33.10]I don't know.
[175:39.90]What else we got?
[175:42.89]We have Jackbox Party Pack 3 is installed.
[175:54.41]What else we got here?
[175:56.96]And I'm usually pretty good about uninstalling games I don't play anymore.
[176:01.46]Waltz of the Wizard, which is a VR game that I never played.
[176:04.92]It's still up.
[176:05.38]It's still here.
[176:10.65]Oh, shit!
[176:12.87]Holy fuck, I forgot I had this game.
[176:16.77]Um, I know what the mystery game is tomorrow.
[176:20.71]I know what the mystery game tomorrow is, and it's gonna be fucking awesome.
[176:25.38]It's gonna be awesome.
[176:28.72]You want me to tell you?
[176:29.66]You wanna know what the mystery game is?
[176:31.06]I don't know if you want me to tell you this.
[176:32.16]It's supposed to be a mystery game.
[176:38.24]Alright, okay.
[176:38.96]Alright, I'll tell you.
[176:40.50]Alright, alright.
[176:41.72]That was 88%, 80, like, 9 to 90% no.
[176:44.75]Uh, don't tell us, but I'm gonna tell you anyways.
[176:47.83]The game we're playing tomorrow is Casino Inc.
[176:54.18]Mm-hmm.
[176:55.06]Mm-hmm.
[176:55.48]Mm-hmm.
[176:56.02]Mm-hmm.
[176:56.48]Mm-hmm.
[177:09.67]This game is not what you think it is.
[177:12.29]It is a... It's a casino tycoon management game.
[177:17.67]Where you have to, like, make the tables and... No, you don't gamble.
[177:23.44]The people come in and do.
[177:25.92]It's an old game and a bunch of crazy shit can happen, apparently.
[177:30.04]Can't be fun.
[177:33.34]Either that or, uh...
[177:38.51]Oh, so no Rain World.
[177:41.48]I already beat Rain World off stream and it was fucking incredible.
[177:44.74]Story, the art.
[177:47.38]I loved it.
[177:47.90]It was awesome.
[177:48.72]I can't play it on stream.
[177:49.48]I already did it.
[177:57.65]What the fuck?
[178:05.31]Lie detector.
[178:07.42]Lie detector.
[178:09.45]I love how I could press that button and just be an idiot.
[178:10.61]It's fun.
[178:10.79]The virus has been detected.
[178:11.41]Hey!
[178:11.50]Thank you toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[178:30.33]Jeremy, I want to say thanks for streaming during a time like this, seeing how Vegas is going.
[178:34.01]I got a pretty bad immune system.
[178:35.21]It's got me worrying.
[178:36.91]Taking my mind off, it's been continuing my binge of VODs from the stream archive from when you started.
[178:44.00]Now I'm in the middle of your Blitz League VODs.
[178:47.12]Oh, I love that game.
[178:49.12]Just wanted to say you're the best entertainer I know, and thank you for the distractions.
[178:52.83]Shout out to the stream archives as well for all they do.
[178:55.39]It's true.
[178:57.47]They do a lot.
[179:02.22]And they've been doing it for a long time, too, so that's good.
[179:08.86]Even before they've just been doing it, that channel has just been uploading, just take the raw stream, put it on YouTube.
[179:22.45]That's really, really great.
[179:23.69]Great, great, great.
[179:27.23]Thank you.
[179:29.07]We are almost at the end.
[179:30.55]We have Jack the Mysterious for $5.
[179:33.23]No message, just $5.
[179:34.31]Thank you, Kun Pal for $5.
[179:36.78]Been having a real bad time recently, and this stream has helped cheer me up.
[179:39.22]Thanks.
[179:41.84]Thanks for hanging out.
[179:54.99]We'll never know about the first stream ever.
[180:00.70]What was the first stream ever?
[180:01.96]Did anybody know?
[180:04.44]What was the first thing I ever live streamed?
[180:06.18]Was it 10 million?
[180:10.18]Is Team Fortress?
[180:11.10]Are we, are you sure?
[180:11.76]I don't know.
[180:17.66]No, I mean, this is like, this is like eight years ago.
[180:19.64]I don't know.
[180:24.88]Nah, my first streams were not on Twitch.
[180:26.56]They were on the original YouTube live.
[180:30.38]Back in, like, 2012, 2013.
[180:36.20]Maybe some founders will know.
[180:39.97]It was TF2.
[180:40.55]Oh, okay.
[180:42.97]Oh.
[180:48.20]Interesting.
[180:48.88]Time flies when you get old.
[180:51.28]Dee Warden, thanks for the thousand bits, ten bucks.
[180:53.70]Hey, Jerma, what do you, what do you, what do you do if you think your friends just act like they like you?
[181:02.53]What do you do if you think your friends just act like they like you?
[181:05.07]What do you mean?
[181:05.49]Like, they don't, they're like, they're pretending to like you?
[181:12.60]I say, you gotta try to make some new friends.
[181:15.16]That doesn't sound... Maybe you, if somebody's pretending to like you, that's, that,
[181:24.17]Yeah, I would move on to another group of people or try to find some new friends.
[181:31.46]How do you make friends?
[181:34.14]Well... Um... It's not really... It's kind of a hard question because I honestly... I'll be completely up front with you.
[181:44.86]I haven't made a whole lot of new friends in the last five to ten years.
[181:52.17]I'm also a lot older, though.
[181:55.75]I have a lot of long-term, long-time friends that I met a long time ago that I've just- they've stayed around for decades.
[182:10.84]35, you should be making children.
[182:15.27]But, when I was younger, it really was just based on interests from me.
[182:22.95]When I was in college, I remember
[182:26.41]Just, you know, I played a lot of video games, and there was other people that played them too, and one of my roommates had consoles, and it was like, oh, nice, cool console.
[182:37.18]You're going to play S3?
[182:38.24]Yeah, cool.
[182:38.88]What do you play?
[182:40.86]And you just base it around interests.
[182:44.42]You make friends because people that you want to spend time with are people that also think the same things that you think are interesting.
[182:50.44]That's how you kind of hang out with them in the first place.
[182:59.45]Or people that you spend enough time with that you can get to know them to be able to call them a friend.
[183:05.29]Somebody that you spend enough time with and you like them and you actually genuinely don't... You know, if you don't get along with one of your co-workers or something, then it's like, okay, well then why would you want to be that person's friend?
[183:18.72]You gotta base it around your interests.
[183:22.26]And stuff that you have in common.
[183:26.07]That really is the only advice I can give, only because I haven't really spent that much time making new friends.
[183:34.30]I have a lot of old friends.
[183:38.99]And it's almost like I made a bunch of friends when I was younger that I don't really need to make anymore, if that makes any sense.
[183:48.00]I got all these buddies back in Massachusetts.
[183:52.66]I've known for decades, like decades, fucking 20, 30 plus years.
[183:58.27]And I'm incredibly close with those people.
[184:01.45]And then there's also people that I've met on this platform.
[184:03.41]There's people that I've met on like YouTube and Twitch that I would call pretty close friends.
[184:08.61]Right?
[184:10.29]But not recently, not in the last probably five plus years.
[184:22.66]Is it hard making friends being, quote, famous?
[184:27.43]No.
[184:28.23]No, I mean, I wouldn't even... I don't think that's accurate.
[184:32.19]Because... I don't think I'm that... I don't think I'm famous.
[184:42.28]I think I'm a person of interest on Twitch.
[184:44.53]I don't think that makes me famous.
[184:49.24]I think famous would entail, like, 50,000 concurrent people here.
[184:53.81]Or, like, I make a post on Instagram and it gets, like, 7 million likes.
[184:57.93]I think at that point, you're famous.
[184:59.37]Famous entails, I think, a lot of, like, public knowledge, right?
[185:11.56]But, no, I doesn't... I've told you this before.
[185:15.12]When this stream turns off, I'm just... I'm a regular guy that...
[185:19.12]You know, sits around, eats potato chips, watches TV, goes to the fucking store.
[185:28.93]Lil Nas retweeted Rat Movie, though.
[185:31.83]Yeah, so a famous person retweeted a thing that I had something maybe to do with that doesn't make me famous.
[185:42.29]Right, you know what I'm saying?
[185:50.51]But you created it.
[185:52.95]Yeah, but... The rat's famous, not me.
[185:56.63]Right?
[185:57.01]And I kind of prefer it that way.
[186:01.78]Lil Nas doesn't even know you exist, bro.
[186:04.16]I... What do you think I'm saying?
[186:05.86]That's what I'm trying to say.
[186:07.12]Yes, he retweeted a thing that I did.
[186:11.35]I don't think he knows who I am.
[186:13.33]That's what I'm telling you.
[186:14.79]That's what I was just saying.
[186:27.10]many people how many people deep dived that and found out where it came from I don't know you might be watching right now that was insane when it happened though that was on the new year's eve stream but let's keep going hey goiki thanks for 500 bits please reunite the drew crew tomorrow I'll do anything
[186:55.76]Reunite the Drew Crew.
[187:00.97]I can't.
[187:02.37]No.
[187:04.27]Not tomorrow.
[187:07.21]No, I can't.
[187:08.55]No, I did... Drew Crew got reunited on the Channel Point stream.
[187:13.01]And then they were immediately skipped.
[187:16.97]After having about 12 minutes of their reunion.
[187:19.95]Sorry.
[187:21.66]Sorry.
[187:24.34]Hey, TheDebo, thanks for 300 bits.
[187:25.98]Hey, Jerma, feels a bit like my whole world is crumbling around me at the moment.
[187:29.22]Just wanted to say thank you for being such an incessantly positive part of my life for eight years.
[187:34.70]And I love to everyone in chat and hope everyone is healthy.
[187:38.81]I'm sorry to hear that.
[187:39.65]I'm not sure what you're going through here, but hopefully you get through it.
[187:52.06]I am absolutely honored to have been a part of your life for that long.
[187:56.88]You've been watching for that long.
[187:59.20]That's almost as long as I've been doing this for.
[188:04.09]That means you've gone through... You went through, like, the Facecam Fortress era, and you're here still now.
[188:09.51]A lot of you guys are there like that.
[188:14.74]That means a lot to me.
[188:16.68]I'm absolutely fucking honored that people would stick around for that long.
[188:20.57]People don't even watch TV shows for that long.
[188:24.03]People watch, like, the first four, five, six seasons of, like... People watch the first, like, three or four seasons of a show like Breaking Bad, and they're like, Yeah, that was fucking phenomenal, but nah, I'm done.
[188:35.27]I'm shocked that I can potentially keep some of you guys' attention for almost nine years now.
[188:39.85]It's crazy to me.
[188:44.09]It only has five seasons.
[188:45.97]Yeah, but I said three or four.
[188:51.15]But... Thanks a lot.
[188:54.99]Really hope shit turns around for you.
[188:57.23]Thanks for the three dollars.

[189:36.14]A dictatorship school thanks for the five dollars.
[189:40.78]I think this is how you donate on mobile.
[189:43.06]You got it figured out?
[189:44.82]Love your streams, even though the real Jerma has been hidden in a basement in St.
[189:47.52]Louis for the last year.
[189:49.16]Anyways, here's some shit I made yesterday while you made the toll booths.
[189:55.35]It's not about money, it's about sending a message.
[189:58.17]Everything burns.
[190:00.95]And then he, then he goes, this is when he goes with the, and he goes, and then...
[190:07.11]This is a spoiler for Batman.
[190:22.08]Oh, yeah, spoiler for Batman.
[190:24.22]Robin is his sidekick.
[190:26.00]Spoiler for Batman.
[190:27.04]Remember the movie that came out ten fucking years ago that every single person in this chat has seen?
[190:32.30]There's no way nobody hasn't seen it yet.
[190:35.30]If you haven't, then I don't know what to say.
[190:37.52]I mean, at what point do you not talk about the Heath Ledger Joker best Batman ever movie?
[190:44.51]I mean, at what point do you... I don't know.
[190:47.09]When can we talk about it?
[190:48.83]When can we talk about the best movie ever?
[190:51.57]Don't.
[190:51.77]Okay, well, here comes a spoiler for Batman.
[190:58.20]The Dark Knight.
[190:59.50]Here it comes.
[191:18.87]What did I save this as?
[191:24.96]I don't know about money, it's about sending a message.
[191:36.23]Never do it for... It burns.
[191:44.09]Thanks a lot.
[191:45.89]Hey, Reaper500, thanks for the 250.
[191:48.30]Hey y'all, let's not let this pandemic make us forget that Derma not only died to Pinwheel, but also lost on the tutorial of Plants vs. Zombies.
[191:59.92]But, no.
[192:02.16]The losing to the tutorial on Plants vs. Zombies was because, in my ear, there was a producer telling me, the bot is broken.
[192:12.54]You have to burn time and talk.
[192:15.76]Everything is fucked up and everything's broken.
[192:18.00]And I'm sitting there just going, what do you mean everything's broken?
[192:19.68]This whole stream, this whole stream, everything's fucked up?
[192:22.07]I don't care about placing fucking plants and shit.
[192:25.01]I'm sitting there listening to a guy in my ear talk about how the stream might need to turn off because everything was fucked up.
[192:37.20]So sorry, I wasn't paying attention to Plants vs. Zombies 1.
[192:44.68]Until you prove it to us you lost to the tutorial.
[192:47.36]I could turn on Plants vs. Zombies right now and beat the tutorial with my eyes closed.
[192:57.01]Do it, fucker.
[192:58.87]Nah, I don't feel like it.
[192:59.71]I'm kind of tired.
[193:00.49]I fucking kind of want food.
[193:01.47]I'm kind of tired and tired and shit.
[193:04.17]Thanks for the, uh, 250.
[193:05.35]I didn't even die to Pinwheel.
[193:07.87]That's a funny fucking joke that we all like.
[193:09.99]Hey, Keith King Crimson, thanks for the 250.
[193:11.75]A lot of the times, people feel like their friends are just pretending.
[193:15.28]Their friends really do care about them and do like them.
[193:17.54]People don't usually pretend to be friends with someone.
[193:20.52]Uh, these kinds of feelings usually come out of a place of paranoia and self-esteem issues.
[193:24.26]I've experienced it a lot.
[193:25.94]Maybe the other chatter ought to talk to their friends about it.
[193:29.14]If they're real friends, they'll care enough to confirm that they're not faking it.
[193:33.97]That is true, too.
[193:34.59]That is true, too.
[193:47.70]I saw him die to Ember.
[193:48.98]You did not.
[193:50.68]You did not.
[193:55.71]You guys have no idea what you're talking about.
[193:58.29]But anyways, let's get back to the real shit here.
[194:02.76]The thing is, we kind of get in our own heads sometimes because you know all of your insecurities, but nobody else does.
[194:13.68]So it's very easy for all of us to kind of project our insecurities because we're up here in our own heads.
[194:22.68]And we think that other people see and know some of these things.
[194:29.74]They don't.
[194:34.29]You implant thoughts in people's brains that they don't even have sometimes.
[194:42.25]That does make sense.
[194:46.44]Thanks, that's pretty good advice.
[194:47.42]Thanks, Keith King Crimson, for the good advice.
[194:54.31]Hey, Gooberry Juice, thanks for $3.
[194:55.33]Hey, wow, cool, Jerms playing Animal Crossing.
[194:58.56]Let me just tune in and... Oh my god, what's wrong with your face?
[195:01.76]Oh man, I needed a break after seeing that.
[195:03.56]Okay, he's playing Cities Skylines now, that's cool.
[195:05.60]Oh my god, what's wrong with your town?
[195:08.02]Jeez, dude, it felt like your... It felt like your face in Animal Crossing and your town in Cities Skylines both got fucked up and went through the same rough party.
[195:20.92]This guy, it's the, oh, I'm back, you're doing another thing and it sucks a bit.
[195:36.44]Guide to Pinwheel confirmed.
[195:38.78]Yeah, who do you think made these?
[195:40.44]Where do you think these came from?
[195:45.08]better I should have been using this from the very beginning yeah you know you know I'm not even gonna you know I'm not gonna take the fucking cover off I'm not gonna take put the curtain up behind so you can look at the wizard no these I'm this was fun nope yeah this is I know it's fucking hilarious I think it's really funny you're not getting you know I'm not pulling the curtain out no sorry you don't you don't want to see the wizard no you don't
[196:19.93]And that's the end.
[196:22.99]Did I run the credits?
[196:23.67]I did, right?
[196:24.61]I want to thank all the fucking people that subbed.
[196:25.97]Did I- I did that, right?
[196:26.77]Yeah, I did.
[196:27.11]I remember selling the name Slime, but... You did not.
[196:34.98]Yes, I did.
[196:36.60]Please do BB unit before you go.
[196:38.08]Please do BB unit before you go.
[196:49.06]H.M.
[196:49.80]Zinc.
[196:50.44]One more before we go.
[196:51.16]Hey, Derma, not to bug you, but do you have any update on the Derma Rumble now that the whole virus thing has probably postponed the Boston Marathon?
[196:59.70]Please tell Otto I said hello.
[197:01.08]Yes, I do have an update for you.
[197:03.26]The new, apparently, as of right now, I believe September is the new deadline for fundraising.
[197:13.60]So if everything stays with the same plan and this goes back to normal, that stream will happen well before September.
[197:26.80]That'll probably happen... Maybe somewhere in like July or August.
[197:37.65]Something like that.
[197:38.45]Somewhere probably around August.
[197:42.37]Let's just hope that this virus is under control by then.
[197:51.99]But that's the plan now.
[197:54.53]Alright, I gotta get some food.
[197:55.63]I'll see you guys tomorrow for a mystery game.
[197:57.79]It could be Casino Inc.
[197:58.81]Or it could be... Hey, it's a mystery game.
[198:02.27]Therefore, it could be Casino Inc.
[198:04.27]And it could be Super Mario Galaxy.
[198:08.44]Or... It could even be...
[198:12.94]Could be Beautiful Joe.
[198:15.26]Or, it could be No More Heroes 2, but it won't be, because that's going to take more than a day to finish, and I got a lot of shit going on next week, and I'm going to have to take some time off to do all this in-real-life shit.
[198:25.19]It's not going to be No More Heroes 2.
[198:26.25]You're going to be lied about No More Heroes 2 within two weeks.
[198:29.41]I know, I did.
[198:30.89]It could be Super Mario Galaxy 2.
[198:33.37]We might just go right to the sequel.
[198:35.38]It could even be
[198:39.59]I don't know.
[198:40.49]I gotta stop saying Super Mario Galaxy, because I don't... I don't even own it.
[198:45.08]I don't own it.
[198:45.78]I don't have it.
[198:46.22]I'm just saying, it's a mystery game.
[198:48.46]It could be anything.
[198:51.84]It could even be... Oh, and it was obvious!
[198:55.58]He's a red spy!
[198:56.78]Good night.
[199:34.16]Oh wait, my audio was delayed.
[199:35.34]You didn't hear me say goodbye.
[199:37.24]Goodbye.
[199:38.90]One.
[199:39.84]Two.
[199:40.86]Three.
[199:41.10]Okay, you should have heard it by now.
[199:42.18]Okay, goodnight.
