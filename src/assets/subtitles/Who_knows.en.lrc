[00:25.75]Hi.
[00:28.99]Hi.
[00:38.65]Howdy.
[00:39.11]Hello, ladies and germs.
[00:44.29]Get it?
[00:45.42]Ladies and germs.
[00:56.04]So I actually set up Twitch alerts for subbing.
[01:01.15]Hopefully it worked and I hope I didn't screw it up.
[01:03.75]Probably did, but you know, whatever.
[01:08.86]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[01:27.28]Good to see you too.
[01:32.17]I hope to be having a good time today.
[01:33.43]I just want to have a good old time.
[01:42.01]Got my coffee right here.
[01:43.97]Got my bottle cap.
[01:46.65]Got my pair of scissors.
[01:49.07]Just in case I need to clip something.
[01:51.29]Found something I need to clip.
[01:52.89]What do you know?
[01:53.79]That's why I keep them down here.
[01:56.37]Alright, we're good.
[02:01.92]What the fuck was that?
[02:05.54]That was like an actual sound of a gun.
[02:07.22]You guys didn't hear that?
[02:13.36]Nobody's weapon sounds like that.
[02:17.55]That's like a construction.
[02:21.85]Who's doing the construction work outside my window?
[02:30.21]How's my day?
[02:30.65]It's going pretty good.
[02:32.97]It's going good.
[02:38.82]Nice bio.
[02:39.88]See, I updated it.
[02:42.10]I updated my biography.
[02:50.56]Isn't it much better than it was before?
[02:53.06]Love that name, by the way.
[02:54.48]Winrar.
[02:58.07]He does have a funny name.
[03:01.92]You promised us 10 additional Jerma planets.
[03:04.30]Well, Twitch has to like approve them.
[03:07.42]I'm like going through and making... Don't worry.
[03:09.63]It's not going to be like today.
[03:11.13]It's going to probably take like a week.
[03:28.99]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[03:29.73]I'm going to get so many frags tonight.
[03:31.33]You know how you just prepare to get a ton of frags?
[03:40.47]Yeah, Earth.
[03:42.27]We're going to have the whole solar system.
[03:46.42]It's probably just going to be that same face.
[03:51.12]Because I can't... Look, I can't force more faces.
[03:54.42]That face is just... I can't replicate that ever again.
[04:16.13]Insta-game.
[04:16.99]You want to get insta-game?
[04:19.59]Okay.
[04:21.63]I'm rocking this morning, guys.
[04:24.66]You know what I mean?
[04:27.38]What time is it even?
[04:28.52]I have no idea.
[04:37.58]Hold on.
[04:38.12]Hold on.
[04:38.42]Hold on.
[04:39.82]Those of you that were here yesterday, let's talk about it again.
[04:42.16]I didn't change anything.
[04:44.96]It's gone.
[04:46.87]This is the first game I've played.
[04:48.55]It's gone.
[04:50.61]Blizzard, why does this keep happening?
[04:53.47]Only my melee.
[04:54.51]Every time.
[04:55.45]There it is.
[04:56.13]That's the inevitable beginning of every stream of Overwatch I do.
[05:10.82]Roadhog should be able to grapple like Widowmaker.
[05:13.14]That would be actually kind of cool.
[05:15.22]I feel like he's way too heavy.
[05:21.52]Isn't he probably, I would assume he's probably at least four or five hundred pounds, right?
[05:24.94]He's like nine feet tall.
[05:31.75]Oh, I thought you were going to keep going.
[05:37.31]Not good.
[05:38.27]Not good!
[05:52.16]What do we got?
[05:53.68]You think this game has physics?
[05:57.28]Yeah, you think this game has actual physics?
[05:59.30]Game physics?
[06:06.72]We're not going to start one of these games, are we?
[06:08.42]Are we just locked in the spawn?
[06:11.66]I hope not.
[06:21.86]I think it is going to be one of those games.
[06:32.88]How tall did... I mean, Soldier's... Nah, maybe he's not nine feet tall.
[06:36.62]Maybe if his posture was improved a little.
[06:45.23]Where is it?
[06:46.03]Yeah, I'll get the yellow one.
[06:50.25]Don't worry, I'll clean it up.
[06:58.46]Alright, let's get out of here.
[07:00.52]Let's get on the cart.
[07:08.14]I would have had it.
[07:12.06]I just barely did engage where she was.
[07:14.31]I thought she was a little further over from where Rocket's trajectory is coming from.
[07:19.23]I'm at least 40 feet long.
[07:27.61]That would be odd.
[07:36.24]You run you better run Just wanted to grab you God Dang it
[08:04.51]The capital fucking D. Don't do it.
[08:15.87]Give me the health pack.
[08:18.51]Give me the tiny health pack.
[08:19.54]The little one.
[08:21.16]Shouldn't get hit by any of those particles.
[08:31.84]Seems a little odd.
[08:36.41]Seems a little odd.
[08:38.76]The game is still in beta, that is correct.
[08:41.80]I'm gonna go around this corner, just do it.
[09:08.48]Get that bubble out of here.
[09:09.54]Stay on the payload.
[09:17.83]Whoa.
[09:19.43]Holy goodness.
[09:20.78]Don't.
[09:21.28]We all dead.
[09:22.52]No.
[09:24.74]Step on it.
[09:32.85]Okay, no more swearing.
[09:34.97]I'm turning over a new leaf this stream.
[09:36.82]Every time I want to say fuck, or like dickhead, or like asshole, I'm going to replace it.
[09:42.68]Don't worry.
[09:43.08]We're going to do at least 30 minutes of no swearing.
[09:46.82]How does that sound?
[09:49.94]That guy killed every single person.
[09:56.95]We're going to replace the word dickhead with...
[10:03.14]I don't know.
[10:03.78]Whatever the first thing comes to my mind.
[10:10.53]Well, let me tell you something, Cello.
[10:16.47]Cello, the grass is always greener on the other side, right?
[10:20.17]Don't worry.
[10:21.75]Shit's gonna get better, Cello.
[10:23.19]Don't worry about it.
[10:24.37]Take it from me.
[10:26.13]I've had some pretty stressful times in my life.
[10:29.33]And I get over it.
[10:30.03]Every time you get over it, you just gotta go forward.
[10:32.61]You gotta strap yourself in.
[10:33.97]You gotta go for that fucking three-point shot.
[10:35.88]You gotta shoot it, and you're gonna get it.
[10:38.22]Go for three-point shots.
[10:39.12]You know, you can't slam dunk every single day.
[10:42.02]Cello.
[10:43.18]It's not gonna happen, you know.
[10:44.54]You gotta go for the three-point shot.
[10:46.02]Be calm, be collected, and be ready.
[10:56.73]What?
[10:56.85]I said I wasn't going to swear anymore.
[10:59.20]We're all soldiers now.
[11:01.18]Shut up!
[11:02.98]Fuck you, stupid idiot!
[11:05.64]Fucking geekbag!
[11:07.28]What's happening?
[11:08.08]What did this, like, voice chat just delve into?
[11:11.01]I am only 19 years of age.
[11:11.85]I don't think I should be listening to this.
[11:25.94]Why does it keep turning my mic off?
[11:30.50]I'm not being Soldier 76, I'm gonna be Mei.
[11:36.42]Think I'd give a shit?
[11:38.26]I'm not supposed to... Okay, uh, shoot.
[11:40.77]Shit, shoot.
[11:41.99]Fuck, fudge.
[11:43.81]Dick, damn.
[11:44.87]Dang.
[11:45.67]Do it.
[11:46.95]Do it, bitch!
[11:48.29]I will do it.
[11:49.71]Oh my goodness.
[11:51.17]Do it!
[11:52.82]I'm doing it right now.
[11:53.76]Do it you fucking asshole!
[11:55.28]Oh my god.
[11:55.90]Fucking do it!
[11:57.48]Do it, bitch!
[11:58.44]I'm trying to- how- what more do I have to do?
[12:01.28]That's not Soldier 76!
[12:03.12]I am Soldier 76.
[12:03.84]Turn into Soldier 76 and do it!
[12:08.54]I'm playing him right now.
[12:09.97]Do it!
[12:12.69]Do it!
[12:19.47]Don't give in.
[12:20.61]Don't give in to the pressure.
[12:24.15]This isn't peer pressure, we're your superiors, bitch!
[12:30.97]Hey, well, good luck ever getting me to pay for your software.
[12:36.74]I run Blizzard, you do it or I remove your beta.
[12:40.10]What kind of accent is that?
[12:42.60]Who ever pays for Winrock?
[12:44.32]Come on, what the fuck are you talking about?
[12:46.88]That's the way I speak!
[12:47.88]It's like a weird, like, Liverpoolian, Bostonian accent.
[12:51.73]It's the basement troll speak.
[12:55.82]Dude, this guy is so bad.
[12:57.82]He's probably so fat.
[13:00.36]Yeah, I probably am.
[13:01.86]I probably should take a look at the mirror or something.
[13:03.66]Not you, bitch!
[13:06.06]Oh, boy.
[13:06.68]Oh, boy.
[13:08.62]Oh, no, guys.
[13:11.22]The old office community is becoming cancer.
[13:16.13]Listen to these guys.
[13:19.09]How much did you guys pay for your beta?
[13:20.57]Alright, well, just always eat your vegetables.
[13:22.21]That's all I gotta say.
[13:24.74]That's how we get out of that.
[13:25.98]Just tell them to always eat their vegetables.
[13:28.27]And leave.
[13:28.63]These guys like just get into the beta?
[13:42.04]No, they've been here for a long time.
[13:54.94]Yeah, we're gonna go Advanced Mei.
[14:05.76]Come on, give me that Advanced Mei.
[14:17.03]Oh, he ulted!
[14:17.77]He actually ulted!
[14:18.79]Oh my god.
[14:19.47]Are you serious?
[14:31.40]Come out again.
[14:32.06]I'll get you.
[14:39.56]I'm really far behind them for some reason.
[14:40.99]Actually, it might be a good idea to just get the Zenyatta.
[14:51.53]You can't hurt me.
[14:54.95]Escape.
[14:57.27]No!
[14:57.95]I thought I was going to get away.
[14:58.67]Genji, come on.
[15:06.18]Do I have a bedtime story for you?
[15:07.34]I don't.
[15:08.94]Oh my god, Nightbot actually is real.
[15:25.02]Nightbot actually is real.
[15:33.58]He makes sense.
[15:45.45]Hopefully I protected somebody.
[15:49.80]According to Nightbot, I'm not playing Undertale anymore.
[15:53.32]Which is good.
[15:53.84]Because I'm not.
[16:01.43]Wait, did they make a Jay and Silent Bob game?
[16:04.17]Since when?
[16:11.72]That's interesting.
[16:20.82]Oh, that was a good reflect.
[16:26.22]He ulted again.
[16:27.82]This would be a good time to do my ult.
[16:32.30]Let's see here.
[16:41.92]I need a healer.
[16:44.48]Maybe I'll go counter Zenyatta.
[16:45.70]We need heals.
[16:46.72]Where's the... Oh my god.
[16:52.33]Well, I got a sub notification now.
[16:54.65]If you're curious.
[16:55.73]Red Ranger.
[17:01.34]I think I set that up correctly.
[17:02.62]I hope I did.
[17:09.52]There's no donation box yet.
[17:13.16]I haven't been... I need to do, like... Don't you need, like, a PayPal business account or something?
[17:19.73]No!
[17:27.41]Stay alive!
[17:42.91]I'm in deep pain right now.
[17:46.45]Kaboom!
[17:57.49]Did somebody die from that?
[18:04.51]Holy shit.
[18:10.08]I didn't think anyone was actually gonna die from that.
[18:20.80]Oh, I have an ult.
[18:26.87]You said the indicator, I thought it was giving out that door.
[18:39.67]And we can even push them out even further if we want to.
[18:50.46]That guy's the ultimate alter.
[18:55.06]I feel like each time I've attacked that Zenyatta, he's been about two seconds away from ulting.
[19:04.61]Mwahaha, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[19:12.32]Hey, the true sound, thank you for subscribing.
[19:20.83]It works.
[19:28.13]I shouldn't have that as the sub sound.
[19:30.81]Because it's going to make me laugh and I won't be able to play video games.
[19:33.80]It was just a test.
[19:39.84]It was just a test to make sure I could actually put sound on it.
[19:51.50]I haven't died yet, so that's a good sign.
[20:02.01]I need to get like an image too or something at some point.
[20:08.27]Oh, shit.
[20:10.63]Nope, it's never gonna happen.
[20:20.31]I feel like I've not been paying attention a second this game's been going on.
[20:23.39]The sub sound will change, guys.
[20:30.29]Doesn't have to be set in stone.
[20:34.71]Could be anything I want, right?
[20:42.38]I didn't want to die there.
[20:43.28]Oh, we're dead.
[20:46.30]I'm dead.
[20:46.66]Bye.
[20:54.94]Just add a spinning Orson Welles head.
[20:56.73]It needs to be him, like, just sipping the wine.
[21:00.01]Come get your armor!
[21:08.52]That is the Shadow Maw.
[21:18.05]Aha, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[21:24.04]Evo Sigma 1, thanks, man.
[21:26.24]Appreciate it.
[21:30.22]I'm glad I have that set up now because it's, uh... At least now I can know when somebody actually subscribes.
[21:37.83]I was missing subscriptions and shit, and I feel bad about it.
[21:46.94]Get rid of that shield!
[21:50.46]Oh, dear.
[21:51.02]Alright, we're going, we're going, uh... No, we only have a minute left.
[21:57.02]I'll stay at the Niana.
[22:05.24]I'm pretty sure we got this in the bag, though.
[22:15.22]Ah, refreshment.
[22:16.90]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[22:22.11]Hitman 109.
[22:24.47]109.
[22:24.61]Thanks, dude.
[22:26.55]Welcome to the wine drinkers.
[22:30.31]Champagne connoisseurs.
[22:31.53]That's what we're calling ourselves now.
[22:40.96]And away we go.
[22:45.70]Shit.
[22:50.14]What is that sub-alert sound?
[22:53.48]It's, uh... I don't know, I've just been on it for a couple days now.
[22:58.80]It's an old commercial from, like, the 80s of Orson Welles being shitfaced on set doing a wine commercial, and it was just hilarious.
[23:08.33]It's, like, one of my favorite YouTube videos because, like, I don't know, Orson Welles is just...
[23:13.24]He's just great.
[23:15.20]Oh, no.
[23:15.71]I don't even know where it is, so I'm going to do it.
[23:17.99]I have no idea where it is.
[23:18.77]I may have actually died if I didn't know where that was.
[23:27.71]Yeah, it's Orson Welles' Paul Maussan.
[23:31.25]He did, like, a dozen commercials for for, like, the wine company Paul Maussan. ...
[23:44.18]Did we lose?
[23:46.00]Did we win?
[23:48.49]GG, guys.
[23:54.49]Ah, the French champagne.
[24:03.45]A rich, full-bodied wine, sensibly priced at a dollar a jug.
[24:07.76]And for a little magic, I will make this jug disappear.
[24:13.52]Maurice... What's his name?
[24:15.06]Maurice Lamar?
[24:16.08]Lamar?
[24:16.34]How do you pronounce his last name?
[24:19.01]That's from The Critic.
[24:19.73]That is from The Critic.
[24:22.17]John Lovitz presents The Critic.
[24:23.41]I want to change something.
[24:30.93]I want... Did I get something?
[24:37.36]Yesterday.
[24:38.08]Yesterday.
[24:44.99]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[24:49.92]Ronnie Gizzo, welcome to the champagne drinkers.
[24:55.84]Hope you enjoy your stay.
[24:58.51]Eventually we'll have a solar system.
[25:05.01]I cringed so hard watching that I could only watch the first 40 seconds is the best part of the whole thing.
[25:10.14]He looks over, everyone's just being totally silent.
[25:13.38]And he finally just looks over at the other actor and goes, He doesn't do anything.
[25:18.98]It's just perfect comedy.
[25:20.56]That first minute of that is perfect, perfect, like just laugh out loud comedy.
[25:27.90]He doesn't do anything.
[25:29.02]No, Austin, cut.
[25:31.59]Hold on.
[25:37.32]Mrs. Pell's fish sticks.
[25:41.00]They're even better when you're dead.
[25:45.16]They're even better raw.
[25:55.71]What do I want to play?
[26:02.45]Let's do some McCree.
[26:03.23]I'm feeling some McCree today.
[26:11.21]It's not even cringy.
[26:12.35]It's Orson Welles at... It's just Orson Welles being Orson Welles on camera.
[26:17.56]It's perfect.
[26:33.58]Well, it's just funny because you could tell he was on set during that wine commercial.
[26:38.22]And he probably just drank too many glasses of the wine that they were shooting.
[26:41.89]And eventually it gets to the point where he's just like, oh, shit.
[26:46.15]I think I'm a little too... I might be drunk right now.
[26:48.93]Can I even do this acting?
[26:58.77]It's like an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, yeah?
[27:12.46]He was too powerful.
[27:13.16]Well, Red Ranger has... How many Power Rangers were there?
[27:17.34]Red, Blue, White, Black, Yellow, Pink, Green.
[27:24.07]Right?
[27:25.05]Does he have... Is there seven Red Rangers?
[27:27.05]Because if that's the case, then that's all the Power Rangers.
[27:43.77]I can act the fuck out of this.
[27:51.80]Oh, green became white, but wasn't there still... Wasn't there a second green ranger or a second white ranger?
[27:57.14]It was Tommy, right?
[28:08.99]Let's do some concentration.
[28:17.14]Help!
[28:18.02]Help!
[28:18.84]Help!
[28:25.02]Where is that?
[28:25.50]I always forget where the health pack hidden on Hardcore is.
[28:28.02]First point, there it is.
[28:40.32]Did not expect you... Oh, that's not good.
[28:51.73]That is not good at all.
[28:56.35]There were three new Rangers after some squad members left the show.
[29:04.09]See, I grew up on the original Power Rangers.
[29:07.32]After Tommy became the White Ranger...
[29:10.60]After that story arc.
[29:12.78]Really, it was after the Ivan Ooze movie, right?
[29:15.16]The Power Rangers movie with Ivan Ooze.
[29:17.38]Is when I didn't watch it anymore.
[29:19.44]That's the last Power Rangers piece of fiction I consumed.
[29:23.70]Was Ivan Ooze.
[29:26.14]Who was a fantastic character, by the way.
[29:34.93]Damn it.
[29:35.97]This dude just prevented me from doing that.
[29:39.03]I would have just left-clicked right there, but he would have killed me with it.
[29:41.71]So I didn't.
[29:43.37]I might have gotten two people there.
[29:45.29]Maybe.
[29:46.45]I was too afraid to get insta-killed by my own bullet.
[29:49.40]Yeah, why would they get rid of Ivan who is... He was in one thing.
[30:13.37]Again, again with this?
[30:21.89]Did I pick up the health?
[30:23.83]I think so.
[30:25.55]Get back up there, get back up there.
[30:28.55]Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[30:38.83]All right, that worked.
[30:44.92]That worked out.
[30:45.48]I should probably just sit on that health pack.
[30:59.03]Who had the frog?
[31:02.29]In the Power Rangers movie, one of the Power Rangers had a frog for his ultimate ability, or his ultimate mech.
[31:07.56]Who was it?
[31:08.12]Because everybody was loving the frog.
[31:15.12]There he is.
[31:19.82]I'm doing some missing here.
[31:34.79]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[31:37.83]Good Drupal Ninja.
[31:40.11]Welcome to the Shock Jockers.
[31:41.53]Put your hands up on that coaster.
[31:46.27]and shock somebody's jock.
[32:00.87]Help!
[32:08.02]Well, somebody killed her.
[32:08.94]It wasn't me.
[32:13.96]All patched up.
[32:17.25]I don't want to just go out here and ult.
[32:24.71]Yeah, I'm going to do it right here.
[32:27.59]Hypo!
[32:28.93]Thanks, dude.
[32:30.43]Hypothermic.
[32:30.93]If you guys don't know who that is, that's Hypo, the very talented Source filmmaker, director, animator, artist.
[32:39.28]That's Hypo.
[32:50.05]He got this locked down pretty well.
[32:51.55]Oh.
[32:59.60]That Lucio timing.
[33:02.38]He's the only person that hit me.
[33:03.48]And he got me with a blow.
[33:05.56]That was just good.
[33:07.78]Perfect placement on his part.
[33:11.29]That's not a good thing.
[33:24.86]I think we might lose her.
[33:27.86]That was a couple of ults.
[33:31.70]Where was I here?
[33:32.44]Right there.
[33:32.92]When was the last time I played Smite?
[33:39.77]It's been a while.
[33:43.89]It has been a while.
[33:47.45]At least 6 to 12 months.
[33:52.01]I used to love that game, though.
[33:54.55]But the problem with Smite, and I think it's the problem with any MOBA that exists, if you do not invest a absolute... I was going to say the S-word, but we're trying to tone down the square words.
[34:09.11]If you don't invest a ton of time into those games,
[34:12.34]you can't really actively play them, right?
[34:17.49]Because if I go back to Smite now, I'm going to be at the same pretty much like MMR ranking as I was before.
[34:24.31]Same level, level 30.
[34:26.51]And I'm going to just get my ass kicked and I'm going to feed.
[34:28.77]It's going to be hard.
[34:29.35]Like you need to invest time into MOBAs to be able to actually actively play them.
[34:45.05]Heroes of the Storm is more lenient.
[34:46.59]Yeah, I think they wanted to make it that way.
[34:49.89]I actually played Heroes of the Storm for a little while.
[34:52.38]Me and Star would play it.
[34:54.56]I didn't play it for very long, but at least a couple weeks we'd play it casually, and it was fun.
[34:59.74]But I'm just not really into top-down MOBAs.
[35:03.90]But if you do not invest time into those games, it's hard to really play them.
[35:15.00]Your alt accounts are dying?
[35:16.12]That's not cool.
[35:16.68]How?
[35:17.04]What happened?
[35:19.90]The S word is shit.
[35:21.94]Dummy.
[35:29.15]I was doing pretty well with McCree.
[35:30.33]Maybe I should play him again.
[35:38.23]When can we go on a date?
[35:41.29]Uh...
[35:43.41]I don't know.
[35:44.47]I don't think... I don't know who you are.
[35:47.83]So... You know, it's kind of hard to be able to say that I'm going to go on a date with somebody when I don't even know who they are.
[35:55.32]So, sorry.
[36:03.92]What if all of my characters wear a mustard jacket?
[36:06.66]Is that true?
[36:08.92]Okay, that's a mustard jacket.
[36:11.64]No.
[36:12.66]No.
[36:13.42]No.
[36:15.22]That's, yeah, kinda.
[36:17.94]Yeah, that could be like a horseradish.
[36:20.50]Wasabi mustard, I get it.
[36:23.06]Mustard.
[36:25.26]Burnt mustard.
[36:27.33]Mustard.
[36:29.21]Horseradish.
[36:31.63]That guy's right.
[36:33.99]Mustard.
[36:38.00]You know, I did not even realize that, but yeah, a lot of my characters are either yellow or green.
[36:45.81]That's pretty funny.
[36:50.28]Blind date.
[36:53.66]Oh god, I didn't think we were actually starting.
[37:11.57]We need either a healer.
[37:12.79]We need some heals here.
[37:15.65]We need a Lucio is what we need.
[37:17.21]Yeah.
[37:17.47]This guy's right.
[37:18.79]I got it.
[37:19.19]I got it.
[37:19.59]I got it.
[37:20.45]Oh, fuck.
[37:20.89]That guy got it.
[37:21.45]I'm going to get some beef in here then.
[37:31.70]Let's talk about mustard for a second, right?
[37:33.08]We're on the topic.
[37:34.24]Might as well.
[37:36.46]I like mustard.
[37:37.80]But how many of you guys also?
[37:39.08]I'm pretty sure everybody does this.
[37:41.50]you use the mustard but you don't first before using it you have to squeeze some out on the other side of like a plate because there's always this weird mustard piss and a crusty mustard cap so you have to like shake it a little bit okay shake it up shake it up piss out the mustard piss get rid of like the crusty crystal that's at the top and then like some comes up and then you can use the mustard every single time
[38:09.97]Why does ketchup not do that?
[38:11.87]Why does mayonnaise not do that?
[38:14.85]Why does relish not do that?
[38:18.82]Disgusting.
[38:23.04]Oh, we're getting kind of beat pretty bad here.
[38:30.07]Could have grabbed her.
[38:50.91]Triple Ninja 2.
[38:52.89]Triple Ninja number 2.
[38:53.77]Cheesy Cheeseburger.
[38:54.33]You have one of my favorite names on Twitch.
[39:20.96]I'm getting a lot of subs right now guys.
[39:25.05]Thank you I think we're gonna get beat here
[39:42.90]Ketchup is busy doing the ketchup effect.
[39:45.26]It waits around for that one moment and then splat, it's everywhere.
[39:51.03]Well, not if you get one of those ketchup bottles that when it's upside down, it's actually right side up and you just have to squeeze it out.
[39:57.52]One of the world's greatest inventions is the upside down condiment can.
[40:04.27]Yeah, or that's correct.
[40:05.61]That is true.
[40:07.15]Crumpet man.
[40:08.15]I'm not crumpet.
[40:08.87]Who even said that?
[40:09.61]Yeah, somebody said that.
[40:13.93]Crackhead Jerry.
[40:15.03]Yeah, it's either I'm getting more or I'm not missing anyone.
[40:22.58]Which is true.
[40:30.97]Which, if that's the case, there's a lot of people I've missed.
[40:35.85]And I'm really sorry about that.
[40:38.59]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[40:42.75]Chucklehead Tom, thank you.
[40:43.87]I grabbed her, by the way.
[40:46.01]I very clearly got her with that chain.
[40:48.01]That was kind of dumb.
[40:49.87]Chucklehead Tom!
[40:53.20]Welcome to the motherfuckers.
[40:55.62]Enjoy it.
[41:01.76]Champagne has always been celebrated for its sexiness.
[41:05.08]That's not what he's saying, but it kind of does sound like that.
[41:17.29]Oh, we got an ultimate here.
[41:18.63]Ah, the flesh.
[41:29.58]champagne has always been celebrated triple ninja one hold on triple ninja two just subscribed triple ninja one subscribed after triple ninja two it's kind of backwards what's going on there
[41:58.36]That's a damage boosted D.Va.
[42:02.49]Do not want to fight that.
[42:10.85]Are you serious?
[42:18.65]Oh, that was... I'm getting kind of denied here.
[42:22.01]Motherfucker.
[42:27.64]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[42:30.78]Snow Snuffle?
[42:33.30]Welcome.
[42:34.08]Thank you.
[42:37.89]And we're going to lose the second game.
[42:40.19]Oh, 90... 100% to 0.
[42:41.91]It can't be that.
[42:42.89]Alright, I'm going to try as hard as I can now.
[43:23.64]Oh, I kept him off.
[43:41.21]Oh, it's too hard!
[43:42.05]According to the highest trivia website, Ketchup exits the bottle at a speed of 0.0450 kilometers an hour.
[43:55.32]Can you explain the game mode?
[43:57.44]So, the middle point, whoever captures it, you know, whatever team actually gets there and caps it with nobody on it, starts to increase the percentage.
[44:06.97]And then, once we fill it up, we win the game, as long as nobody else on the other team is contesting it.
[44:20.03]Man, it's just... Team is too good.
[44:30.53]Louis the Cashew, or Louis the Cashew.
[44:32.76]I got cut off there.
[44:33.50]I don't know why.
[44:35.92]But Louis the Cashew just subscribed.
[44:40.56]Thank you, dude.
[44:43.00]Bring it on, Orson.
[44:52.15]Oh, there it is.
[44:54.56]What?
[44:54.96]Hold on a second.
[44:58.24]Who subscribed before him, then?
[45:02.42]They popped up two times.
[45:04.28]Was there somebody before Louis the Cashew?
[45:10.98]Well, someone just subscribed, apparently.
[45:20.68]I have not played Far Cry Primal.
[45:33.30]Yeah, it's a best of three King of the Hill.
[45:36.45]And they change map.
[45:37.39]Okay, imagine, you know in TF2 when you have, like, playing Dust Bowl.
[45:40.42]And there's three different stages of Dust Bowl.
[45:44.48]It's like that, except King of the Hill.
[45:46.84]With a control point that you have to battle back and forth on.
[45:50.47]It's the best game mode in the game.
[45:52.11]They just put it in this beta and it's absolutely the most fun thing in the game.
[45:54.75]I think it's the most competitive and it's the most engaging.
[45:58.03]So hopefully we see more of it.
[46:15.60]The emulsifiers commonly used in... Oh, it got deleted.
[46:19.71]Why did that get deleted?
[46:21.55]What did it say?
[46:22.31]Was it too big?
[46:26.99]Was it too much of a wall of tech?
[46:28.75]Did Nightbot get you?
[46:29.57]Oh.
[46:43.82]Well, it's not that I won't take donations or tips, it's that I haven't set it up yet, and I'm just, I'm battling with the ability in my own brain to accept them.
[46:53.59]Right?
[47:02.41]He spammed it like 10 times, sorry.
[47:04.17]Oh, well, whatever.
[47:09.96]Okay.
[47:11.22]Except they break up faster.
[47:13.20]Okay.
[47:13.88]Well.
[47:14.86]And now here we go.
[47:19.22]The emulsifier is covered.
[47:20.56]The emulsifier must turn into a emulsification process.
[47:23.04]In case you didn't know.
[47:28.64]There's Hanzo.
[47:33.17]I should have knocked him off.
[47:34.81]Whoa, Mei.
[47:37.47]She's going to insta-die when she comes out of this.
[47:41.57]Well, she didn't insta-die.
[47:43.23]It took her actually a very long time to die.
[47:51.40]What the hell?
[47:52.46]Where were the Symmetra things?
[47:54.58]Shooters.
[47:56.26]Where were those Symmetra shooters?
[47:57.32]I'm going Bastion down there too.
[48:08.31]At least I got him to move.
[48:12.00]Whoops.
[48:19.96]He's dead.
[48:20.86]We could probably push in here.
[48:22.06]Is that it?
[48:30.51]Holy shit.
[48:35.41]Did he?
[48:36.09]Oh, he was just in that little spot.
[48:38.07]I didn't even know he was in there.
[48:42.46]Oh, we're going up against Renbot and Shade and those guys.
[48:45.00]Alright, I gotta try.
[48:46.15]I gotta, like, actually try here.
[48:48.43]This is imperative.
[49:21.37]Don't land in that!
[49:23.09]Don't land in that.
[49:31.89]Just barely got away.
[49:47.69]I could probably get a couple of kills here, hopefully.
[49:49.65]If I get into the right spot.
[49:56.59]No, I don't want to do it yet.
[50:00.20]When they push in again, maybe.
[50:01.68]Your alt account's broke?
[50:21.13]He's gonna ult, I think, maybe?
[50:26.61]Yeah, he tried to.
[50:31.59]Oof, we got it!
[50:33.45]We actually got it!
[50:34.29]Does this game have a set release date?
[50:40.95]Um... They're saying June, I think.
[50:43.49]Somewhere in like late spring, early summer.
[50:46.71]I would assume it's probably like late May, June, July, possibly.
[51:02.81]They're all behind us.
[51:03.51]Is she in the corner?
[51:13.48]That was confusing.
[51:14.14]I thought she was going to be hiding in there.
[51:18.10]June 21st, give or take.
[51:19.16]That makes sense.
[51:25.87]I hope it comes out soon.
[51:27.73]Sooner rather than later.
[51:31.15]Because the game really is pretty much, I would say, it's really close to being done.
[51:45.31]They didn't... Honestly, I think the thing that they're the most scared of is probably the fact that they need to make sure the servers can stay online.
[51:55.39]You know what I mean?
[51:56.95]With, like, potentially hundreds of thousands or even a million or so people, like, all trying to play it.
[52:02.31]Get this guy out of here.
[52:15.02]Are they gonna add more characters?
[52:16.54]I would assume, yes.
[52:17.38]I think they've already, kind of, on Twitter said that they were gonna, after launch, look into it and potentially add people.
[52:31.07]Yikes.
[52:37.04]Are there any noticeable bugs in this game?
[52:40.52]Not really.
[52:41.46]I mean, there are some, but Blizzard does usually a really good job with polishing their games in regards to technical issues.
[53:00.54]There's a good seven years of Overwatch before they add bumper cars.
[53:06.63]Yeah, they have to add bumper cars and ducks and all that stuff that they added in TF2.
[53:16.60]Oh, I got somebody!
[53:31.08]I thought he was going to grab me.
[53:32.22]I actually thought I was going to get hit right in the shins.
[53:42.99]I shouldn't have died.
[53:43.75]That was such a waste.
[53:44.77]That was such a waste of an ult.
[53:46.17]Why did I do that?
[53:53.59]I just threw that ult into the garbage can.
[53:58.49]Whoa, easy.
[54:13.20]Ah, justice from above.
[54:14.84]What kind of frame rate am I seeing?
[54:22.20]It has been rock solid.
[54:25.19]No matter where I am.
[54:28.11]Completely rock solid.
[54:29.45]At least 60 frames.
[54:30.67]Even more than that.
[54:31.47]I mean, I think I'm running this game pretty much at 120 hertz, 120 frames.
[54:36.45]It is wonderful in that department.
[54:38.96]I have not seen any slowdowns.
[54:40.70]Absolutely zero.
[54:57.26]Yeah, they got skins.
[54:57.76]They're gonna be adding way more skins, too.
[55:02.01]Skins are gonna be a thing that'll be for a long time.
[55:19.54]Aww, he ringwraithed.
[55:25.98]No!
[55:26.28]Bastion!
[55:26.62]I keep forgetting about that Bastion!
[55:34.76]I forget about that Bastion every time, and it's the death of me.
[55:42.70]Put my computer specs in the bio?
[55:44.12]Yeah.
[55:46.34]My computer specs really aren't that great.
[55:47.66]I mean, I have a decent... Well, I say decent.
[55:50.82]About three or four years ago.
[55:58.07]Three or four for you.
[55:59.53]Hold on.
[55:59.93]Can't talk.
[56:00.87]Can't talk.
[56:01.25]Need to get rid of the Bastion.
[56:06.69]He's just being blocked.
[56:07.51]60 seconds remaining.
[56:27.93]Reinhardt-Bastion combo.
[56:37.63]I don't know why I always feel like somebody's gonna hurt him.
[56:41.39]I almost just killed myself.
[56:44.81]I almost just killed myself.
[56:46.48]That would have been so bad.
[56:49.68]I have 15 HP.
[56:50.70]I'm so dead.
[56:52.76]What do I do?
[56:54.30]He knows I'm over here too.
[56:55.32]I need to get health back.
[56:56.43]Don't kill me.
[56:57.63]Don't do it.
[57:01.41]Where's the health back?
[57:02.67]Where is it?
[57:03.65]That's a teeny tiny one.
[57:04.83]I don't want this one.
[57:05.39]I have an I7.
[57:20.05]All right, we might be able to do something.
[57:37.08]It's going to be tricky.
[57:38.80]No, I think we lose.
[57:40.04]Oh, well.
[57:47.08]The Lucio video tells us if you are streaming at this very moment.
[57:51.60]Yeah.
[57:53.70]Something I wanted to do.
[57:54.75]Just needed to find the right time and be on a good schedule, at least personally.
[58:04.87]Be productive.
[58:06.98]This last week or so here, everything has kind of clicked.
[58:09.92]And I've been able to do it.
[58:22.22]What made you decide to change your stream settings?
[58:24.80]It looks so much better than it did a few... I got a lot of feedback about it.
[58:29.92]It was at least a dozen people that wrote comments in chat and stuff saying that I need to change my stream quality because it's kind of bad.
[58:39.25]So I was like, okay.
[58:41.65]And I looked back at it.
[58:42.49]I did a little bit of research and I said, okay, I'll do this.
[58:45.21]Seems like a pretty easy fix.
[58:47.31]And I tried something different.
[58:48.75]Different.
[58:50.83]Different.
[58:53.72]I'm getting stuck on words today.
[58:56.62]You know what?
[58:57.04]I'm getting stuck on words today.
[58:58.66]I have, like, different... And they always have a D. It's either a J or a D. Right?
[59:17.09]Oh, you know what game is coming out today or something that I wanted to play?
[59:21.55]That slow-motion game where when you move, it's a first-person shooter, and when you move, everybody else moves.
[59:27.86]And when you stand still, everybody stands still.
[59:30.92]I really want to play that game.
[59:32.18]It looks really funny and really fun.
[59:37.76]Hmm...
[59:48.53]Super hot.
[59:49.09]Yeah, that's it.
[59:50.58]I really want to play that.
[60:00.04]It's coming out in like an hour.
[60:01.06]Maybe I'll stream it.
[60:04.65]Maybe.
[60:05.13]I use that term very, very tentatively.
[60:13.48]Attackers incoming in 30 seconds.
[60:22.39]2, 3.
[60:22.49]And his battle cry is he gives everybody on the enemy board minus 1 attack.
[60:52.19]Hmm...
[61:23.85]Ouch Will I ever upload stream highlights to YouTube I Mean if I were to stream that game super hot And it was funny and interesting and I thought it was a good enough recording.
[61:44.25]Maybe I'd cut it up or something.
[61:47.23]I don't know Getting rolled here
[62:06.02]This guy is just all over the place right now.
[62:07.94]I can't kill him.
[62:10.60]The way he was moving was crazy.
[62:12.76]Look at the damage boost.
[62:15.72]That was nuts.
[62:27.13]Dang it.
[62:29.75]Alt accounts assemble?
[62:37.34]Now, here would be the cool thing, right?
[62:39.82]Can you change the color of your Twitch chat?
[62:42.06]Because then you could actually make all the colors of the Power Rangers.
[62:54.24]Shit.
[62:55.18]Sniper.
[63:02.56]I need to talk to Twitch about the moon.
[63:05.04]Tell them to absolutely remove the first one.
[63:07.78]Because it's the light one.
[63:08.68]You can't really see it.
[63:11.05]It will not go away.
[63:12.09]I don't know why.
[63:32.09]That's a lot of people coming in here.
[63:43.88]That was unlucky of me to not kill him.
[63:50.89]Run!
[63:57.29]I do have my tactical visor.
[64:01.03]I couldn't utilize it, like, right now.
[64:07.89]Did I actually just die?
[64:09.17]How much damage did he just do to me?
[64:14.62]He hit me with every single shot, and then punched me, and I insta-died.
[64:18.22]That didn't feel like it should have happened.
[64:23.87]I'm getting our asses kicked.
[64:36.15]Nice ult.
[64:36.73]Well, I got just shit on.
[64:38.79]I walked out the front door and insta-died by a Lucio, of all people.
[64:43.38]I don't know how that even happened.
[65:03.12]How does it feel to reach a billion subscribers?
[65:05.04]I'm not even... even close to that.
[65:07.30]I didn't really do much that game.
[65:24.10]Oh, I thought I was gonna have a box.
[65:34.15]I thought I was close enough.
[65:34.99]Am I not even that close?
[65:39.09]I guess not.
[65:46.20]It was a nice ult.
[65:47.02]That's why I complimented it.
[65:54.98]Soldier 76 is weird, man.
[65:56.30]I feel like half the time I play him, I cannot hit anything.
[66:01.65]And then the other 50% I play him, I can hit every shot.
[66:10.29]He's very unreliable for me.
[66:23.84]Do-do-do-do-do.
[66:25.14]Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[66:34.28]I don't want to play Temple of Anubis again.
[66:37.90]That's another reason kind of why I ran away.
[66:39.46]You know, I am very inconsistent, especially with spray characters.
[67:12.03]Characters with a machine gun?
[67:14.61]I am extremely inconsistent with.
[67:26.69]Would I smooch a ghost?
[67:27.68]I don't know.
[67:33.04]I don't know, that's a good question.
[67:36.30]Would that even be physically possible to do that?
[67:39.50]That sounds pretty implausible.
[67:53.01]What does that mean?
[67:54.41]Don't get caught with your beard in the litter box.
[67:59.24]Does that imply that Torbjorn eats cat shit out of the litter box?
[68:05.40]Like a dog?
[68:06.06]Get rid of that bubble.
[68:20.59]Oh, that's gone.
[68:21.09]Oh my goodness.
[68:27.00]I'm going to go back a little further here.
[68:30.84]I feel like they're going to push through this very quickly.
[69:05.19]She res him.
[69:07.47]Is he resurrected?
[69:20.57]Keep him out of here.
[69:22.47]Watch out for the Pharah ultimate ability.
[69:31.58]I need to go get some scrap.
[69:32.74]Right in the head.
[69:33.84]I did that, I thought there were going to be more people here.
[70:15.79]Sentry's just doing work back there Back to 300 Super someone does super hard come out.
[70:38.55]Is it in like an hour actually really an hour?
[70:41.47]Come on
[70:46.72]I need to check that after this game.
[70:50.38]Ah, I hate when that happens.
[71:02.15]It's really annoying when you just miss hitting it.
[71:13.15]There's too many people in this room.
[71:14.27]I don't even know where anyone was.
[71:21.44]I hate that.
[71:23.42]Little over half an hour.
[71:48.31]Can I pre-purchase it?
[71:49.13]Is it available on Steam or do you have to buy it from a different site?
[71:55.59]Hmm, he's up there.
[72:14.31]I just double shot her.
[72:16.85]I hit that Mercy in the head two times.
[72:18.45]Alright, I gotta get away from the turret in case he tries to.
[72:25.38]Oh my god.
[72:26.74]Aye aye aye.
[72:28.16]Please have an ult if somebody comes in.
[72:37.50]You know what, I might just do it now.
[72:39.81]Yep.
[73:07.01]Level 3 Centric is temporary.
[73:14.69]Just keep this up.
[73:15.96]I don't care about anything else at the moment.
[73:39.24]No!
[73:49.38]So Torbjorn's ultimate, it upgrades your level 2 sentry to level 3 immediately.
[73:56.53]You cannot put a sentry up and get it to level 3.
[74:00.25]I think we might lose right now.
[74:05.09]Yeah, it upgrades your level 2 to level 3.
[74:08.17]It gives you a shitload of armor.
[74:10.72]And you shoot faster.
[74:12.48]You pretty much just turn into a gigantic... Hold on a minute.
[74:16.55]This is important.
[74:40.76]Son of a bitch.
[74:46.51]I tried.
[74:48.51]I tried.
[74:54.81]Was it enough?
[74:57.66]Give me the health.
[75:10.13]Just throw it on the point so somebody can get it.
[75:23.06]Here comes the mech.
[75:29.21]Don't let that... I gotta put it over here.
[75:32.67]It's probably a little safer over here.
[75:39.28]I do almost have another ult, which is a good thing.
[75:41.95]Give me the scrap, give me the scrap, give me the scrap.
[75:46.75]I need to watch out for the Reaper, typically comes around here.
[76:00.83]Very well timed ultimate.
[76:23.25]There's only two more minutes of this.
[76:31.10]I want that scrap.
[76:36.56]I want... Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[76:39.15]Get away.
[76:40.45]I kind of want to just go out there and just start smashing.
[76:50.35]I want to go out there and just start smashing.
[77:02.55]He's over here.
[77:06.64]He ain't gonna get away.
[77:07.96]He got away.
[77:19.86]Oh, no.
[77:23.37]No.
[77:26.87]Uh...
[77:34.94]I tried to get out there and... I should just get out there and press Q. If I get out there and just press Q, I might be able to kill some people.
[77:46.82]We're gonna go for it.
[77:47.74]Maybe not.
[77:49.40]Maybe it's not necessary.
[77:53.42]It is necessary.
[78:08.76]He's dead.
[78:13.59]If I can't get up there quick enough, get it.
[78:15.35]Pick up the armor.
[78:17.91]30 seconds.
[78:23.99]Yes, the stream is 45 FPS.
[78:25.07]I got two Divas.
[78:26.13]I do have two Divas.
[78:28.49]This is it.
[78:52.74]Get it up.
[78:58.25]Keep him off the point!
[79:13.87]I think we win!
[79:15.53]God, that was actually pretty intense.
[79:19.21]Phew!
[79:31.94]Lucio, huh?
[79:34.62]What was it?
[79:36.70]Face punch?
[79:40.12]Okay, he did a lot of work here.
[79:45.72]I mean, he really, he got like a couple of kills, but it was, I don't know, just his presence and the fact that he got a couple of kills.
[79:52.40]He was doing work that whole game, though.
[79:56.31]Not him.
[79:56.69]Wait, that's the same guy, right?
[79:59.23]I'm confused.
[79:59.81]I'm going to give it to this guy.
[80:14.88]Yeah, I knew I was close to a box.
[80:18.31]He got one killed and walked into a wall.
[80:22.13]Well, he pretty much air shot the pharaoh, which that's kind of difficult to do with that weapon.
[80:27.19]It's weird.
[80:27.62]Let's play the game, man.
[80:30.86]Don't ever question play the game.
[80:32.52]It always means that they got the play of the game.
[80:36.30]Right?
[80:50.43]Get a box after this.
[80:51.73]Open it.
[80:53.25]Actually, wait a second.
[80:53.85]Hold on a second.
[80:54.35]How do I leave the queue?
[80:56.39]I don't want to leave the queue.
[80:58.21]Cancel.
[81:01.94]I want to check something.
[81:05.12]I want to see if that game is out.
[81:06.94]Because then maybe I'll install it.
[81:11.70]Give me one second, guys.
[81:13.76]While I check.
[81:26.06]Is it available?
[81:31.74]Approximately one hour, but that was... It's up to one hour, so what is it, like 10, 20 minutes away?
[81:45.41]Maybe that's enough.
[81:45.95]That should be enough for me to beat the box game, as they say.
[81:53.25]We'll try it out.
[81:54.89]So this will be the last game of Overwatch and then I'm gonna try out Superhot.
[82:14.90]God, I hope I get a Legendary.
[82:21.28]Do I know anything about Superhot?
[82:23.66]I know that it's an FPS that is based around you moving.
[82:34.37]That's all I know.
[82:36.31]We're going in blind.
[82:59.03]Time moves when you move.
[83:00.31]That is all I know.
[83:02.44]Seems really interesting.
[83:03.48]Alright, final game.
[83:08.26]Who am I going to play as?
[83:08.92]We'll jump right into the last game.
[83:25.92]I'm also going to potentially load up the X-Story.
[83:30.76]So you'll see numbers in the corner of the screen.
[83:32.50]Because if it is fun and interesting, maybe I would upload it.
[83:35.26]Cut it up and stuff.
[83:37.74]Get out of my face!
[83:50.43]Yeah, I do have Birdman.
[83:52.87]I have the bird skin.
[84:02.28]I got a squeaky chair.
[84:03.14]I gotta get some WD-40 on this thing.
[84:20.04]There is no fall damage in Overwatch.
[84:23.16]Zero.
[84:24.40]Welcome to Hollywood.
[84:28.25]Prepare your defenses.
[84:36.07]Favorite hero personality-wise?
[84:38.39]Roadhog.
[84:46.60]I love his cough laughing.
[84:48.50]And the fact that he's a pig under the mask.
[84:54.35]Or at least he better be.
[85:15.30]Make German Rumble 4 before the show catches up and has to improvise.
[85:22.04]That's a funny Game of Thrones reference.
[85:28.12]Just put that in an FAQ at the bottom.
[85:31.94]That in May you'll see German Rumble 4.
[85:45.63]I actually have never looked at these posters up close.
[86:01.53]Who's it directed by?
[86:02.53]Who cares?
[86:04.75]For some reason I thought that was gonna- I thought it was behind the wall.
[86:36.14]Not good with the directs right now.
[86:43.22]Couldn't land a direct to save my life right there.
[86:51.34]I was undercompensating a lot.
[86:52.64]For some reason, the hitbox for the direct is actually pretty huge.
[86:57.68]And I usually have to lead much bigger than that.
[87:00.04]And I was leading under leading him for some reason.
[87:18.02]Still got him.
[87:18.74]I don't want to play Junkrat.
[87:22.76]I'm realizing that right now.
[87:25.04]No, I do.
[87:25.56]I do.
[87:26.28]I do.
[87:26.51]I do.
[87:52.40]I'm expecting you to run in this room.
[88:01.80]Yeah, I concede.
[88:03.18]I'm not playing Junkrat.
[88:06.89]It's not a Junkrat day.
[88:09.11]Get her.
[88:28.74]Just barely
[88:59.31]I've got unfinished business.
[89:24.38]I hit her so many times that I can just kind of... Okay.
[89:28.32]I wanted the headshot to kill.
[89:31.46]Oh, shit.
[89:34.36]Wow!
[89:35.04]That guy just got three kills.
[89:38.20]This guy just got three kills in one second.
[89:40.10]I'm just going to come right here and I'm going to kill her.
[89:53.48]Anybody else?
[90:36.95]That Hanzo triple.
[90:38.33]Hanzo. Hanzo.
[90:48.84]Nooo!
[91:01.08]Agh, really?
[91:06.08]If he didn't have that, I would have killed him.
[91:07.99]That's too bad.
[91:14.47]This life's never uneventful.
[91:15.57]Defend the point.
[91:21.26]Oh well.
[91:21.80]Objective lost.
[91:24.34]Stop the payload.
[91:30.05]I want them to come through this door.
[91:33.29]I'm going to get at least one person with this.
[91:35.25]I have to kill... Where's the tracer?
[91:37.77]Where are you going?
[91:41.43]Shit.
[91:41.85]This guy's right here.
[91:44.53]I need health.
[92:00.96]Somebody heal me!
[92:03.58]We haven't had a healer.
[92:07.80]And yet again I forget where the health packs are here.
[92:11.44]It's not here.
[92:11.94]A lot of rooms to go in here.
[92:17.06]There it is.
[92:19.31]The jail cell.
[92:32.52]Ah!
[92:33.16]Damn it!
[92:38.26]Yeah, McCree must feel right at home.
[92:42.84]He is in Hollywood.
[93:29.00]I gotta play a tank or something.
[93:31.13]I'm getting just pushed so hard.
[93:45.62]At least I got my health back.
[93:58.23]Jeez.
[94:01.25]I'm just gonna go out and press Q and then play a different character.
[94:03.55]Like a tank.
[94:06.93]Just killed me with everything.
[94:21.91]I don't even care.
[94:24.25]Just kill one person, I don't give a shit.
[94:28.85]Alright, now I can change characters.
[94:38.29]Oh my lord.
[94:59.57]We just got destroyed From that second point forward they just rent like rolled I Wasn't doing very much that game was kind of just getting shit on the whole game unfortunately I
[95:28.32]Oh my god.
[95:30.14]Look at this guy.
[95:32.74]Look at this guy!
[95:34.65]That guy was our entire team.
[95:46.89]I can't go out on that one.
[95:47.87]I gotta do one more.
[95:51.05]But I do have a box.
[96:01.23]What is it?
[96:05.47]It's a Winston Legendary!
[96:09.41]Undersea.
[96:12.52]Nice.
[96:13.38]I will definitely put that on.
[96:22.14]Alright, this is great.
[96:23.48]This is amazing.
[96:25.29]Definitely using that.
[96:26.47]Just look at this dumb cartoon.
[96:31.62]Whatever, who cares?
[96:32.34]Oh, I like my McCree.
[96:35.26]No, actually, sure.
[96:36.36]Alright, this is the final game.
[96:40.96]I gotta go out on a good one.
[96:46.49]I'm gonna go out on a good one.
[96:55.44]Ikea spray.
[96:58.29]It says upgrade in Swedish.
[96:59.89]Isn't Torgron supposed to be a Swedish character?
[97:03.65]That's the fakest woohoo I've ever heard.
[97:05.45]Woohoo.
[97:06.19]What are you talking about?
[97:08.65]What an enthusiastic streamer!
[97:11.31]Woohoo!
[97:12.30]Woohoo!
[97:13.24]Woohoo!
[97:14.44]Is that better?
[97:17.98]When the thing was glowing orange, should I have gone... What the fuck?!
[97:23.84]What?! !
[97:28.33]Maybe I'll do that next time.
[97:43.69]That's a little too enthusiastic.
[97:45.84]Just a little bit.
[98:03.29]Metal music.
[98:06.83]What?
[98:08.07]Did I just seriously get a legendary?
[98:11.93]Did I seriously?
[98:17.30]You gotta be kidding me.
[98:21.82]Mom?
[98:23.06]Dad?
[98:23.68]You're gonna have to get in here for this one.
[98:26.52]Should've hit him.
[98:31.97]Alright, let's go.
[98:37.75]I've had a couple of good games during this stream and I've had a couple of bad games too.
[98:41.21]Let's even it out.
[98:41.89]Let's have a good game right now.
[98:48.14]We're going for gold across the board.
[98:50.58]You know what I mean?
[98:53.34]Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold.
[98:58.44]Four gold.
[99:05.78]The N64 kid.
[99:06.45]Nintendo 64!
[99:08.75]Oh my god!
[99:12.13]And then he starts scratching it like a dog.
[99:17.55]Scratching to get like a bone that's underneath the sofa.
[99:31.09]How can I not use the new skin?
[99:33.13]I put it on.
[99:35.77]We'll look at it later.
[99:36.99]Remember, I'm going for four gold.
[99:39.13]Remember guys, that's important.
[99:41.63]Four gold.
[99:45.10]You see, one, two, three, four.
[99:48.54]If I don't get four gold right now, then I'm just going to turn off my game and play super hard.
[99:57.58]That's what I was probably going to do anyways.
[100:04.41]I'm gonna go the other way.
[100:07.97]Let's do it!
[100:14.44]I'm trying to get rid of that.
[100:24.56]That took a lot of hits.
[100:37.84]We both instantly died.
[100:48.97]I already almost have an ult.
[100:50.64]It seems kind of insane.
[101:13.75]Let's get on it.
[101:14.69]Terror shooting me?
[101:16.19]That was a good sight I got.
[101:21.19]Very good.
[101:22.87]Thanks for the sight.
[101:52.13]We killed each other again.
[101:53.91]I've only got three gold.
[101:54.79]That's not good.
[102:03.71]That's not good.
[102:05.01]I gotta get four.
[102:05.83]What is that?
[102:17.59]I hear him reflecting.
[102:20.01]What is he reflecting?
[102:20.81]I don't know.
[102:22.56]There he is.
[102:22.90]Thought he was going to be right there.
[102:31.70]That's not good.
[102:42.65]Ah, if only he wasn't right.
[102:43.51]I knew he was over there too.
[102:44.43]Shit.
[102:47.66]There's nothing I could do about that.
[102:50.72]You know what I should have done?
[102:52.00]I could have gone to the right and tried to get him.
[102:56.21]Instead I died by his ultimate.
[103:04.81]Good work on the Twitch info and links.
[103:06.17]Yeah, I put it in there.
[103:07.31]It's good, right?
[103:25.75]He's got a Mercy on him.
[103:35.65]I should use my ult, but... Holy shit, dude!
[103:43.74]Wow!
[103:45.66]That was crazy!
[103:52.08]She did it again!
[103:52.80]He came out and did it again.
[103:56.16]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[103:59.24]Hey, Gray007.
[104:00.38]Thanks, man.
[104:04.39]I only have one gold now.
[104:05.81]I've got to really turn this on.
[104:09.11]Okay, he was backtracking while he pulled me.
[104:13.04]Welcome, Gray007.
[104:22.11]Going up top.
[104:24.09]Forget this nonsense.
[104:30.68]Just waiting for it to come down here.
[104:38.72]Damn.
[104:39.28]That Mercy.
[104:43.46]It's gonna be hard for me to 1v1 this guy when he has a Mercy on him.
[104:56.69]It's my mercy.
[104:59.57]I need a healer.
[105:02.77]I need one.
[105:04.98]Here we go again.
[105:12.56]Damn.
[105:31.15]He went the other way.
[105:31.89]I thought he was gonna back up.
[105:53.28]Nice push.
[105:54.24]Nice job, dude.
[105:56.13]Oh my god.
[105:57.09]That's not good either.
[106:23.95]Nice work.
[106:25.31]Reinhardt, you were fantastic right there.
[106:30.41]What the fuck?
[106:34.49]Yikes.
[106:35.47]Stripes gum.
[106:39.75]I hate when that happens.
[106:40.67]I hate it.
[106:41.45]I really hate that.
[106:42.49]With a passion.
[106:46.10]Like, on my screen, I hit her right in the face, it hooked her, and it didn't work.
[106:52.09]I really don't like that.
[106:53.07]I really hate that.
[106:58.93]Hey, hey.
[107:01.29]What are you doing back here?
[107:08.11]How the hell did you even get back here?
[107:12.57]Are you serious?
[107:15.14]One of your, like, 75 Genjis, it was just that one guy.
[107:19.10]He just followed me in.
[107:26.75]That could save everything right now.
[107:29.27]Touch it!
[107:31.67]Well, I didn't get four golds.
[107:36.28]I may have.
[107:38.10]If that went on, like, another minute.
[107:43.77]I don't know.
[107:44.71]That last minute or two, though, I was trying my pants off.
[107:51.03]But, it's all good.
[107:57.92]I blame the... You know what?
[107:59.28]Really?
[108:00.38]I blame the... Not hooking that tracer.
[108:05.94]Grabbed that tracer and it didn't happen.
[108:07.68]That was the reason why I lost.
[108:13.21]Vote myself up.
[108:13.97]Why not?
[108:15.21]Hold on.
[108:15.55]Let's check.
[108:16.01]Is it up?
[108:16.89]Is it viable?
[108:23.10]These were all so close, probably.
[108:25.00]So close to gold.
[108:27.92]Let's take a look.
[108:29.50]Super hot.
[108:29.94]Where are you?
[108:41.83]Um, it is not available yet, so it looks like we're playing another game Good old me I really should go to the bathroom
[109:13.19]I gotta pee.
[109:20.71]I pee a lot.
[109:22.77]I do.
[109:23.05]I also drink a lot of liquids, though.
[109:29.14]I take in plenty of fluids.
[109:36.20]I drink coffee.
[109:36.92]I drink, uh...
[109:43.46]Lots of water.
[109:47.19]In my office, I wish there was a toilet right here.
[109:48.85]I'm not even kidding.
[109:52.55]If there was just a little urinal right there.
[109:56.30]So I could just be like, hold on a second.
[109:57.86]I'll be right back, guys.
[110:01.34]I could still be sitting down in the chair.
[110:04.44]I could be seated.
[110:06.34]Just zip it out.
[110:07.92]There's the urinal.
[110:09.45]Done deal.
[110:11.07]And it wouldn't even need to flush.
[110:12.53]It could be one of those urinals that just doesn't even need to be flushed.
[110:15.75]I'm going green, you know?
[110:16.63]I'm going green.
[110:21.45]And I could just... At that point, I wouldn't even need to wear clothes.
[110:24.85]God, that would be amazing.
[110:27.37]I could just sit here naked and just go pee over to the left.
[110:34.72]If only, right?
[110:35.66]Hmm.
[110:40.58]The computer chair is the toilet.
[110:44.22]I'm just sitting on a toilet right now.
[110:47.77]God, that would be... Something about that is wrong.
[110:56.80]I get trolled, everybody.
[110:58.14]I'm the red team.
[111:20.46]Ooh, nice pull.
[111:33.99]Wow.
[111:35.15]I almost died.
[111:38.59]Word, almost.
[111:39.28]Get that stupid shield down.
[111:44.64]I was too scared to stay in there.
[111:47.78]Where is it?
[111:48.24]I'm going to block it.
[111:56.99]Come on now.
[111:59.41]Too many Zaryas.
[112:09.81]Damn it, don't launch me around.
[112:11.77]Ah, come on.
[112:14.63]Two Zaryas.
[112:15.65]Fucking insane.
[112:16.57]Can't touch anybody.
[112:28.58]Actually, I wouldn't want the bathroom chair.
[112:31.34]Because... What if I had to, like, go to the bathroom?
[112:36.14]Quote, bathroom, bathroom.
[112:38.00]You know what I mean?
[112:42.79]Would I just do it right now?
[112:43.73]Doesn't seem like a very good idea.
[112:58.28]Bathroom, bathroom.
[113:03.60]I need a ga- yeah, donations could help for my gamer bathroom, that's right.
[113:14.23]I- I feel like that happened a lot longer after he died.
[113:19.88]Was it that fast?
[113:20.82]I don't know why, I feel like it just didn't even happen.
[113:28.36]Just mute your mic.
[113:32.19]Yeah, but then you guys would know what I'm doing, and it'd be even grosser, wouldn't it?
[113:44.53]I didn't block it.
[113:45.09]You're telling me I didn't block that?
[113:48.34]Oh, it came from behind me.
[113:57.74]Yeah, I could just do nude streams.
[114:00.82]I would obviously not be on camera.
[114:02.48]Are you kidding me, guys?
[114:04.04]Are you absolutely kidding me?
[114:05.78]Are you serious?
[114:10.76]Got her in the head.
[114:12.54]Got her in the head.
[114:19.22]How many are over here?
[114:20.28]Should I go for it?
[114:21.90]Should I go for it?
[114:24.00]No, not yet.
[114:26.12]Not quite.
[114:28.56]Here he comes.
[114:30.28]You know what?
[114:30.64]Screw it.
[114:31.46]Good luck.
[114:32.45]Good luck getting me.
[114:33.29]I was trying to kill her in turn and...
[114:53.07]Thinking about this way too hard.
[114:54.27]Freeze!
[115:01.61]Don't move!
[115:24.79]You know, I actually like to use that move to calm down for a second and actually survey what's going on.
[115:30.93]You know, it actually works fairly well.
[115:49.12]Wish I hit that Lucio a third time.
[115:59.69]Get him.
[116:00.03]I blocked him.
[116:01.39]Nice work.
[116:07.95]I'm gonna have to freeze.
[116:16.14]Don't move here in a second, I believe.
[116:31.68]Did I save everybody?
[116:33.68]Did I save Christmas?
[116:36.89]I believe I saved Christmas.
[116:57.70]Get me away!
[117:01.90]I feel like, did I get chained?
[117:04.14]I got chained.
[117:08.25]No, did I step on the... I stepped on the spiky dog shit like always.
[117:11.21]Where am I?
[117:28.40]I hit him in the head.
[117:29.43]No, I did it again!
[117:30.39]And I was just too busy thinking that I hit him in the head while he jumped.
[117:35.73]Watch, I hit him right in the face, he jumps in the air, and I go, Hey, let me look over there and watch these fucking balls on the ground.
[117:39.80]Let me just pick them all up and eat them.
[117:48.10]What are those?
[118:02.43]I had four gold.
[118:06.64]That counts.
[118:07.84]I had four gold at the last second.
[118:09.68]It's okay.
[118:10.06]It counts.
[118:11.20]Is it available?
[118:18.28]I can see it.
[118:23.89]Come on, man.
[118:26.64]No, it's still not available.
[118:34.40]Super Heart is still not available.
[118:35.64]God!
[118:37.90]Okay, I gotta leave game because I have to pee.
[118:40.48]So maybe when I come back it'll be ready.
[118:44.71]I'll be back in two minutes.
[118:47.67]Hold your horses.
[120:52.45]Is it available?
[121:01.71]Still not.
[121:10.28]Why did I piece?
[121:10.92]Oh, you couldn't hear that.
[121:15.82]You did not hear that.
[121:19.03]No way.
[121:19.43]I refuse to believe that.
[121:32.10]It's available for you?
[121:32.94]Well, I kind of want to get it on Steam.
[121:36.32]Steam is kind of where all my games are collectively.
[121:41.85]You could not hear that!
[121:44.84]There's no way.
[121:45.36]If you guys could actually hear that, that's... That seems impossible to me.
[121:49.59]No.
[121:50.27]I don't believe it.
[121:51.09]I refuse to believe it.
[121:53.79]I refuse to believe it.
[122:08.75]Oh, so okay.
[122:10.03]So you guys heard it, huh?
[122:11.47]Well, halfway through, what happened?
[122:13.27]Hmm?
[122:15.33]If you heard it so well.
[122:16.55]Halfway through, something happened.
[122:17.81]What happened?
[122:19.31]Hmm.
[122:20.57]Got you now.
[122:35.58]Hmm.
[122:36.46]Oh, yeah.
[122:37.86]Well, you farted.
[122:38.68]No, that's not what happened.
[122:40.57]Nope, didn't sneeze.
[122:55.50]Oh, wow.
[122:56.80]Wouldn't you guys like to know?
[123:06.13]Actually, I bit into a granola bar and I said, that's some good granola.
[123:13.64]And then I rolled my eyes back and I went, oh.
[123:22.62]Yeah.
[123:23.70]I peed handsless.
[123:25.44]Hmm.
[123:27.57]Handsless.
[123:30.79]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[123:38.41]That always comes out of nowhere and it's always funny.
[123:44.90]Thanks, dude.
[123:46.14]Thanks, him or her.
[123:49.48]Welcome to the slipstreamers.
[124:10.14]You got him Reinhardt, excellent, excellent work.
[124:17.71]Is that her body?
[124:29.56]Still behind.
[124:34.08]Boink!
[124:46.14]Hi, guys.
[124:49.76]The whole team is in that room.
[124:53.25]That's a scary place to be.
[124:55.63]She's stuck?
[124:57.79]I actually nabbed her in there.
[124:59.09]I am ready to activate the sound.
[125:17.07]Rewind.
[125:18.07]Rewind and I'll get you right in the head.
[125:31.43]Damn it.
[125:32.27]You know what?
[125:38.53]I'm just gonna go get him.
[125:40.43]Be a go-getter.
[125:46.57]He's not dead.
[125:58.52]There's no living through that one.
[126:03.56]Ah, the friendship, babe.
[126:12.00]What's the best Rupia brand?
[126:14.73]Um...
[126:16.49]No, I don't really drink root beer.
[126:36.41]Ooooooh.
[126:47.04]Who is it?
[126:50.24]Jerma's super loud pee.
[126:52.53]I had to look up the screen.
[126:55.33]My super loud pee just subscribed to the channel.
[127:02.56]Well, welcome.
[127:05.66]Welcome, obvious alt account to this stream we have here.
[127:32.16]He's so close to dead!
[127:33.50]Not anymore, I guess.
[127:46.71]I've been so close to getting a bunch of kills, but just they always end up with 18 HP.
[128:06.04]I missed the break it down.
[128:07.85]Dang.
[128:09.01]Is he dead?
[128:15.03]Is that him?
[128:15.45]That was him.
[128:22.34]Hey.
[128:22.76]Don't you do that.
[128:27.94]Tracer.
[128:28.32]Tracer.
[128:47.09]I've been holding onto this ult for a long time.
[129:06.92]Crap.
[129:08.68]Well, I'll get somebody in here.
[129:11.66]McCree went up here, yes he did.
[129:16.48]He's dead!
[129:17.30]Oh.
[129:26.08]I don't see any bad guys.
[129:37.05]Now they got a Reinhardt.
[129:53.05]I'll stand right in front of you.
[129:54.09]A lot of objective kills, but nothing really else.
[130:08.86]This game's weird.
[130:09.48]I feel like I'm doing a lot, but not anything at all.
[130:12.10]Does that make any sense?
[130:31.31]Oh, he had to do that, didn't he?
[130:36.59]I need to use my ult.
[130:43.20]I need to use my ult.
[131:08.99]What?
[131:09.27]What?
[131:10.35]Why did I come out of that?
[131:13.03]Why did I get out of that?
[131:13.85]That didn't make any sense.
[131:16.79]See?
[131:20.85]I pressed the button and then magically I was not in it anymore.
[131:46.41]Okay.
[131:47.95]I think we won.
[131:51.71]Damn.
[131:53.93]17 eliminations.
[131:54.95]And I don't even have a bronze medal.
[131:57.17]That is crazy.
[131:58.47]That means somebody in this game on this team has like 40 eliminations.
[132:02.11]Or like 50 or something insane.
[132:20.64]20 eliminations.
[132:22.90]25 eliminations.
[132:23.55]Somebody had to have like 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 or 100.
[132:26.73]Can we get an update?
[132:38.39]Is Superhot available?
[132:44.47]What's taking Steam so long, man?
[132:59.25]A lot of objective time?
[133:00.51]That's cool, I guess.
[133:12.33]Well, Mei seems to be working quite well.
[133:19.65]The Humble Store actually does give you a Steam Key.
[133:24.25]Maybe I'll do that.
[133:43.54]I haven't drank a root beer.
[133:47.38]I was about to lie.
[133:49.18]I had a root beer probably a week ago.
[133:51.64]But it was one of those weird root beers.
[133:53.62]I think it was called Zevia.
[133:56.51]It's a root beer without any artificial coloring in it.
[134:01.09]And it's like Stevia plant or something.
[134:03.99]I don't know.
[134:04.57]Somebody just had it in their fridge and I drank it.
[134:06.39]It was pretty good.
[134:14.53]I'm gonna hide right here.
[134:22.41]No, just so they know I was here, you know what I mean?
[134:25.12]Someone's gonna come up these stairs and they're gonna look left and be like, wait a second, there was a Mei here.
[134:31.04]Tread carefully.
[134:31.82]No, I can't stand up on that?
[134:57.47]I think you're going to get behind everybody.
[134:59.95]But you are just not going to do that.
[135:13.99]Really?
[135:14.29]He didn't get frozen?
[135:15.13]That's nonsense.
[135:22.18]Hit me in the head three times.
[135:23.64]This fight is not over yet.
[135:34.59]And the chocolate factory.
[135:35.49]I used to drink Code Red.
[135:44.06]Code Red was my drink of choice.
[135:46.02]Mountain Dew.
[135:56.05]Just barely off with those.
[136:01.35]Need my ult.
[136:02.19]I'm gonna change.
[136:03.19]We need some more damage.
[136:04.70]Some real damage.
[136:17.36]Man, this guy's good.
[136:19.18]He's killing everybody.
[136:36.47]I'm gonna ult.
[136:38.47]And then change.
[136:39.55]I'm just gonna Frisbee it in, give it a fuck.
[136:46.00]Nice.
[136:56.92]I knew it.
[136:57.36]I just hit him right in the face.
[136:58.58]I think the guy's angry with me in the chat.
[137:30.01]Oh, I almost got him through the trees.
[137:39.31]I got him there.
[137:49.06]Barrier fight.
[137:50.14]That was anticlimactic.
[138:01.79]Finally, my God, can one of us kill each other?
[138:04.11]That went on for so long.
[138:26.55]I'm so high in the air.
[138:29.33]They were ants.
[138:46.56]Well, at least he's dead.
[138:58.85]Monster phase.
[138:59.93]Drinking monsters.
[139:01.63]I could never.
[139:03.21]I drank a monster energy.
[139:04.45]Sometimes when I go to conventions and I have to be awake and you're getting three or four hours of sleep a night.
[139:10.97]Sometimes I will drink one of those.
[139:12.33]They make me feel like I'm going to die.
[139:18.28]Not even kidding.
[139:19.72]I feel like I'm going to die after I drink one.
[139:29.39]McCree?
[139:30.69]Oh no, this guy.
[139:36.11]I don't even know what happened.
[139:38.41]He threw three shurikens at me and he exploded.
[139:50.97]Especially later, after two or three hours after you have an energy drink.
[139:57.11]It's almost like you barely exist on this playing field.
[139:59.97]You're not on this plane of existence.
[140:13.62]Damn.
[140:18.14]If I had focused on him, I might have actually killed him.
[140:21.75]But I didn't.
[140:30.43]Red Bull doesn't usually make me feel terrible, but I don't really drink that either.
[140:33.83]That's another thing that I drink extremely rarely.
[140:35.68]That's going to be good.
[141:12.09]Who's breaking it down?
[141:12.99]We are?
[141:13.43]Good.
[141:28.92]Didn't kill him.
[141:31.73]He's still in there.
[141:34.96]Where is he?
[141:35.72]Is he hiding behind the judge's table?
[141:39.10]No, he's not.
[141:39.68]I'm scared.
[141:41.32]Kill the Lucio.
[141:44.02]That's all I care about.
[141:46.39]Justice reigns from above.
[142:05.28]Do I like to get hammered?
[142:07.16]No.
[142:09.32]I'll have a few drinks here and there when I'm able to.
[142:11.68]For fun or for it to be social, but... I haven't really... I don't know.
[142:17.30]Getting, like, shit-faced.
[142:18.59]It's just not... I'm too old for that shit now.
[142:27.43]Ah, he's one-hit.
[142:35.25]I was trying to bait the charge.
[142:36.37]I was trying to bait the charge but it didn't work.
[143:00.52]Even like Twitch parties.
[143:02.06]Every time I go to a Twitch party.
[143:03.98]Or, oh man, this PAX Prime.
[143:06.44]Curse Gaming.
[143:08.76]This last one.
[143:09.58]I mean, I've like drank during those.
[143:12.32]And yeah, I got a little drunk.
[143:15.03]But this last one, I kind of just didn't care anymore.
[143:19.05]I'm just like, yeah, I'll have a drink or two.
[143:21.05]I don't care.
[143:22.39]I give up on being a drinker.
[143:38.19]Bad spot for that.
[143:38.93]I'll take it.
[143:57.83]I'll take it.
[144:01.81]Your shit's still censored?
[144:02.91]Yeah, I've noticed that.
[144:04.49]When people say, like, a swear, is it censored?
[144:06.51]What happened?
[144:08.41]Did I do that?
[144:09.81]I don't... I didn't mean to.
[144:10.81]That was what happened.
[144:14.01]You had a few beers at GXL, but you didn't get... Yeah, that's typically what it is now.
[144:18.74]I'll have like, you know, two, three... Once you get past like the four drinks, like four beers, it's like, alright, I probably shouldn't be doing this right now.
[144:26.96]I'll chill out.
[144:31.50]Come on, really?
[144:33.04]Taking me all the way back here.
[144:34.69]What happened?
[144:35.15]Why did I not die?
[144:36.63]I am angry for that guy.
[144:38.39]I am upset for this guy.
[144:41.79]I'm mad.
[144:43.15]I'm going to cause all the anger for that guy.
[144:52.13]I absolutely should have died from that.
[144:53.83]Absolutely.
[145:03.64]No, whoops I did open the plug it All right, we got a
[145:24.30]We're playing that game.
[145:25.02]It's going to get to a point where the game's not even out and it's like two or three, four hours go by and I don't even feel like streaming anymore.
[145:30.80]Because it's getting to that point.
[145:33.17]Typically, I don't stream for more than three, four, five hours.
[145:38.63]So, maybe we'll do it tomorrow or maybe later.
[145:46.60]If it was available an hour ago, right when I was saying I wanted to do it,
[145:55.39]Maybe, but it is getting a little bit later in the day.
[146:20.58]Take a break, set up a donation box, and then you can start back up again.
[146:26.24]I'm scared of that donation box.
[146:27.84]I really am.
[146:31.94]You've been asking for that so much.
[146:33.34]I feel like I'm gonna turn it on.
[146:34.63]Turn the stream on.
[146:35.59]And I'm gonna get a thousand dollars or something.
[146:37.65]And I'm gonna be like, I can't do this anymore.
[146:39.73]I gotta leave.
[146:40.15]I'm gonna sprint away.
[146:53.06]Hey, I'm playing against Star.
[146:55.34]Is he streaming?
[146:58.31]Is Star streaming Overwatch right now?
[147:00.05]Let's check.
[147:02.01]Uh, no.
[147:06.39]He's just playing.
[147:08.99]Well, here we go.
[147:11.77]That would be a quality problem to have.
[147:19.99]What was he doing?
[147:26.23]We have Healer.
[147:26.85]We have a Winston.
[147:52.42]Anybody else up there?
[147:53.08]I know he's up there.
[147:54.06]Just waiting for him to come around.
[147:55.84]There's a sniper!
[148:02.78]Do not headshot me.
[148:06.53]You would upset me.
[148:07.45]Can I grab him?
[148:09.54]He's so low.
[148:10.44]Thank you for the orb.
[148:33.13]Crap.
[148:34.23]Again?
[148:34.56]I'm wedged in the wall.
[148:37.82]I am too fat, I'm wedged inside the wall.
[148:40.22]Aww, I wanted to get credit.
[149:00.36]I wanted some credit.
[149:10.89]Where is he?
[149:11.53]What's going on?
[149:14.95]Oh, he's up there.
[149:18.69]Somebody's got it.
[149:19.23]Winston will take care of him.
[149:33.63]What the hell am I doing?
[149:35.61]What am I doing?
[149:36.67]Oh, he's gonna shoot the dragon out the door!
[149:44.19]That was actually terrifying.
[149:48.89]So is that.
[149:50.91]So is the sniper that I can grab.
[149:59.14]Keep it rolling, boys and girls.
[150:13.85]Is that so who's start point is he playing like play Hanzo They're squirting the payload So far of a run
[150:43.59]We're doing well, though.
[150:52.39]Yeah!
[150:53.37]Keep it rolling, keep it rolling.
[150:55.55]Fuck.
[151:02.64]I'm stuck over here.
[151:07.82]Wedged up into the wall, and a sniper.
[151:10.26]I'm the only person here having to fall back.
[151:11.66]Oh no, Winston's here.
[151:12.44]Winston's here.
[151:21.65]Who expects the fat guy to go up and around the hallway?
[151:24.55]Nobody.
[151:24.85]Like, does anybody ever expect something like that?
[151:31.53]I'll tell you how to spawn.
[151:48.50]I figured with maybe a panic ult, people would kind of help kill.
[151:52.49]But that was my own mistake.
[151:53.65]I shouldn't have been doing that.
[152:02.81]If they come up with a Roadhog skin that actually has him with the pig face, with a beard or something, I would pay $100 for that skin.
[152:10.92]I think I've already talked about it.
[152:21.81]This is not a good place for me to be right now.
[152:24.75]Again, so close.
[152:45.79]Oh, they have two!
[152:48.33]That's what was going on in my brain.
[152:49.73]I was like, hold on a second.
[152:50.75]I hooked him, but there's two Roadhogs on that team now.
[153:02.64]Piecing that together was a puzzle in my brain.
[153:05.66]Come on now, that's bullshit.
[153:09.48]What a load of fucking dog shit.
[153:13.38]Well, now I'm going to fucking kill you.
[153:14.50]Oh, no, I can't.
[153:15.86]You're invincible.
[153:19.14]Oh, wow.
[153:20.04]That was so annoying.
[153:35.29]At least I got him.
[153:48.71]Trying to just keep people away.
[154:17.70]Okay, well that's good.
[154:19.86]Get on it!
[154:28.23]Get away!
[154:29.91]Here comes Zarya.
[154:52.22]Fucking star.
[154:56.66]What are you watching the stream?
[155:02.77]He's just ghosted.
[155:13.01]You can't say star 3 germa 0 when he's playing Hanzo and I'm Roadhog.
[155:18.59]He can literally shoot me from across the map.
[155:21.46]anti-stream sniping.
[155:39.30]I'll hide.
[155:43.61]Just gonna go back all the way around.
[155:46.67]Why are we stopped?
[155:48.33]Get the lead out and move this payload.
[156:04.44]See where he shot that?
[156:05.30]There was nobody over there, but me.
[156:10.52]Did you see that?
[156:11.01]Yeah.
[156:16.03]I call shenanigans on that.
[156:31.81]Too much going on too much going on Give me a fucking break
[157:00.31]I can't get that by myself.
[157:34.25]There's nothing I can do.
[157:47.56]Holy shit, we're on it.
[157:50.44]We're actually on it.
[157:56.88]Get my ult.
[157:57.95]Stay on it.
[158:02.19]Touch it.
[158:03.09]Touch it.
[158:06.84]Second too late.
[158:16.73]Look at that.
[158:26.51]Every single person was in that.
[158:28.19]Holy God.
[158:45.95]That's a lot of on fire.
[158:51.38]Eh, this person was doing work.
[158:59.46]Can we play the other game?
[159:11.51]Uh...
[159:14.31]I think it actually might be available.
[159:15.65]I don't see it in upcoming anymore.
[159:18.86]Let's find out.
[159:23.74]I think I can do it.
[159:24.56]I don't see it in upcoming.
[159:26.08]It means it must be releasing.
[159:33.75]It's got to be minutes away, right?
[159:35.15]It's not listed in upcoming?
[159:41.89]I'm just going to go to the Humble Store.
[159:59.78]It still says soon for you?
[160:02.62]Hold on.
[160:03.28]Hold on.
[160:09.57]What the heck, Superhot?
[160:10.59]What's going on?
[160:11.93]Uh-oh.
[160:12.55]Who the hell is that?
[160:19.03]Hey?
[160:21.99]Hey.
[160:23.42]How are you watching the stream?
[160:24.42]How's the quality?
[160:25.40]Is it good?
[160:27.70]I paused the stream when that game started.
[160:31.98]Did you?
[160:33.62]Why are you coming in so defensive?
[160:37.57]Because I saw your chat.
[160:39.29]Your chat was just lines and lines of he's watching you.
[160:43.95]Yeah.
[160:45.99]Didn't even have to stream up apparently.
[160:49.69]Just right after the game ends, comes right in.
[160:51.25]Hey, what's up?
[160:51.77]I'm not playing Overwatch anymore.
[160:52.91]I want to play one game with my friend.
[160:56.64]You want to play one game?
[160:59.12]Yeah.
[160:59.98]Are you playing again?
[161:00.70]Because you're stupid super hot, isn't it?
[161:04.76]It looks fun.
[161:08.19]I can get it on the humble store.
[161:12.54]I just have to buy it through the humble store Wow, give you a steam key Wow, where's that steam loyalty?
[161:18.95]You're still getting the steam key.
[161:20.19]Where's the loyalty though?
[161:21.83]Can you calm down?
[161:24.15]I'm just asking where the loyalty is.
[161:26.09]It's plenty of loyalty
[161:32.51]Don't you remember that time Steam leaked everyone's password and you could reset people's password?
[161:38.71]Like, where's the loyalty, dude?
[161:44.04]I mean, I already have some money on my Steam account.
[161:46.36]This is kind of a pain in the ass.
[161:57.59]It's 22 bucks.
[162:00.06]All right.
[162:00.26]I don't know.
[162:01.70]I might just wait till it's on Steam because I already have like exactly $22 on Steam.
[162:09.23]I'm at like wallet.
[162:12.77]So.
[162:15.51]I'm going to wait for it to come out on Steam.
[162:20.46]Because for me, it left the it was in upcoming releases on Steam.
[162:25.60]And for me, it's not there anymore.
[162:28.55]So that means that it must be pushing through very, very soon.
[162:37.69]It's $25?
[162:39.18]Well, I already have money on Steam.
[162:49.46]Do you want to play another game, Overwatch?
[162:51.92]Yeah.
[162:52.82]Okay.
[162:54.66]Let's go.
[162:56.22]Make sure you don't stream snipe me this time.
[162:59.99]um speaking of the tracer and mccree on your team blatantly like only were coming at me well there was one point where you altered you altered where I was standing and I was the only person there were you which one yeah like it was right when we were about to turn the corner for the last like push there with like 40 maybe a minute left in the game you just altered it just me only me exactly where I was standing
[163:27.14]I think I felt there were more people there.
[163:28.78]Looked very suspicious.
[163:30.18]Even if I was watching your stream, there's like a minute delay.
[163:33.16]What?
[163:34.81]If you watch it on source, it's like nine seconds.
[163:37.57]I was spectating you in client.
[163:40.23]Why?
[163:41.70]Because you have to do that to join someone's game.
[163:43.99]I intentionally joined your game.
[163:45.33]That was the point.
[163:46.17]Spectating me?
[163:46.87]Okay, he's watching me.
[163:47.83]So when you click join game in the game, he's watching me?
[163:50.05]He's watching me through the window?
[163:52.73]I could see a real-time new game in the stream.
[163:55.41]There's no way you could ever gain information from that.
[164:00.95]Unless you were playing Symmetra and I was destroying your teleporters that I saw on stream.
[164:04.52]Then you could be like, oh, well.
[164:06.64]Yeah, right.
[164:07.48]This character isn't fun to play on stream.
[164:14.41]Well, good graphics.
[164:15.25]Let's go to the Steam forums.
[164:27.98]Is there people saying they got it yet?
[164:34.00]Send an email to Obama.
[164:37.94]Ask for Superhot.
[164:45.81]you like my new subscriber notification uh no I haven't seen it because I wasn't really watching the stream and who subscribes to you a bunch of people there's been all kinds of support from my lovely wonderful viewers what are you talking about
[165:12.83]Well, what is it?
[165:14.85]I don't know.
[165:23.60]Did it play when Jerma's super loud P subscribed?
[165:26.48]Yeah.
[165:35.36]Hold on, were we just in a skirmish and moved to another skirmish?
[165:38.06]Yes, we did.
[165:39.22]I think maybe it reached the end of that skirmish and changed maps.
[165:43.74]Oh, okay.
[165:44.92]The skirmish is in 30 minutes.
[165:46.96]We're just unlucky, boys.
[165:50.80]What would the donation notification be?
[166:04.22]the second half of that line.
[166:05.63]That actually would be pretty funny.
[166:13.33]Maybe it was just the second part of that line that already starts when you subscribe.
[166:18.43]All of my notifications are just gonna be Orson Welles quotes.
[166:28.00]That'd be awesome.
[166:36.54]This is the new Winston skin.
[166:38.04]Oh yeah, you got the Winston-er.
[166:39.80]How many do you have?
[166:40.68]This is the only Winston skin I have.
[166:43.46]This is cool though.
[166:44.32]I mean, how many legendaries have you got?
[166:46.64]Four?
[166:46.90]Five?
[166:47.02]That's a lie.
[166:52.82]You can have all of them.
[166:54.36]Blizzard unlocked them all for you.
[166:57.22]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[167:01.34]Yeah.
[167:03.78]Domitan.
[167:05.25]Domitan.
[167:05.83]Domitan underscore.
[167:06.73]Thanks for subbing.
[167:08.83]Did you hear it?
[167:10.49]I don't have your stream on.
[167:11.83]I'm talking to you.
[167:13.01]You're watching me right now.
[167:16.23]What am I looking at right now?
[167:19.65]Offense.
[167:20.03]Yep.
[167:21.13]I caught the end of it.
[167:22.35]It was just like a fucking BM mumbling.
[167:24.94]Nope.
[167:28.02]And you have the default Twitch alerts, like name show up.
[167:30.88]I just set it up this morning.
[167:33.50]I'm going to obviously change things.
[167:35.01]I just wanted to get it up and working.
[167:36.51]God, you're so condescending.
[167:39.39]This will protect us.
[167:41.13]I mean, it does take a full 20 seconds to change, like, font and things, I guess.
[167:45.19]I guess I understand that.
[167:46.71]Font?
[167:47.05]I mean, I changed, like, the... what it looks like and the sound and... You know what?
[167:52.17]It's taking a long time to find us, like, a six-person party to Q&Q right now.
[167:56.25]This really has taken a long time.
[167:57.92]Yeah, I gotta find more Orson Welles quotes to put as notifications.
[168:09.69]Prepare your defenses.
[168:17.44]Hello there.
[168:26.95]Super hot, super hot.
[168:37.20]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[168:39.98]The donation sound is going to be... There is a California wine by Paul Masson.
[168:45.60]Inspired by that same French excellence.
[168:48.87]Yeah, it has to be.
[168:51.09]I need to change mine.
[168:52.45]My sub now sounds... I've been saying it for like a month.
[168:56.53]What is it?
[168:56.89]It's so bad.
[168:58.99]It's the Miss Pauling stuff.
[169:00.29]Oh yeah, it really is.
[169:02.16]I've changed one of them to an aim instant message, but that's just because I had the sound already.
[169:13.58]I like the orange arm.
[169:16.20]By the way, to the guy that said every single one of my characters is a mustard character,
[169:22.02]This is a mustard Winston.
[169:24.97]That's not really mustard.
[169:26.19]I mean, it kind of is.
[169:27.21]This is like a honey Dijon.
[169:28.85]That's a bit more like a miso.
[169:30.65]No, this is a honey Dijon.
[169:32.85]With a little bit of Tabasco sauce in it.
[169:34.47]It's still mustard.
[169:36.01]I guess.
[169:37.00]I guess if you're going to manipulate your mustard, anything can be a mustard color.
[169:40.48]Nah, it's mustard.
[169:44.21]Ow.
[169:45.65]I just remembered why I haven't been playing any video games.
[169:49.21]Why?
[169:49.47]My hand, like, really hurts.
[169:51.67]It took, like, one game for me to remember.
[169:54.59]No, it's, it's like, it's not, it's weird.
[169:57.63]He's gonna rewind right in front of you guys.
[170:08.88]Oh, he has an orb on him.
[170:09.88]Damn it.
[170:12.16]I got the
[170:16.51]I have Tracer.
[170:24.71]I'll manipulate your mustard.
[170:38.15]Why don't you get one of those wrist things where you put your hand in and it's a giant contraption that goes around your wrist.
[170:43.00]Oh, like Lara Croft's boobies?
[170:46.38]What?
[170:47.62]What?
[170:48.10]Where did that come from?
[170:48.96]What does that even mean?
[170:49.70]I don't get it.
[170:52.85]I thought for a second I was going to be able to ult.
[170:56.41]I was banking on the fact that I was going to do enough damage to do it, but it did not happen.
[171:02.34]I mean all gold everything over here Not even a thousand damage why don't you play another character then What I barely ever play home though.
[171:12.16]Yeah, you played like all day Yes, you're right
[171:31.15]he's high nooning that took so long to kill that tracer oh I'm so dead I punched that tracer it felt like maybe 100 to 200 times
[172:01.92]Oh, that Mei freeze is so good against giant monkey boy.
[172:04.60]Hiding the ball!
[172:08.98]You can delete Tracer's bomb after she throws it with D.Va.
[172:13.21]I swear it was already on the ground.
[172:15.29]What do you mean?
[172:16.11]I've never tried it.
[172:17.45]The defense matrix.
[172:19.09]I swear it was already stuck to the ground and I got rid of it.
[172:29.74]He's got me in his sights.
[172:37.97]I'm wrong about that, like everything else in my life.
[172:42.95]Well, at least 7 more minutes of this.
[172:52.19]Come on.
[172:52.81]Well, I got one.
[173:01.72]Maybe you could switch characters.
[173:03.70]Me?
[173:03.82]What are you talking about?
[173:06.66]I'm Winston.
[173:09.92]I just also learned Defense Matrix does not get rid of McCree's stuns.
[173:15.34]Oh, he was so close.
[173:17.70]I thought I could kill him before he got me.
[173:22.89]How much health did he have?
[173:23.65]22.
[173:23.67]Tracer to the right!
[173:56.59]He has that again?
[173:57.51]How?
[174:01.57]No, no, I think he got it.
[174:08.59]Oh no, they're gonna get it.
[174:13.74]Oh no, I didn't think he got three people at that high noon, but apparently he did.
[174:17.26]Did he?
[174:18.54]Yeah.
[174:20.46]Quickly go, jump and run into the wall.
[174:21.70]Give me the armor.
[174:36.86]This is just a mess.
[174:38.16]This is a total total mess Somebody just took all the paint colors on this watch there Whatever the hell it is and just mashed them all together and now you got a puke brown.
[174:49.31]I don't even know what's going on We're losing To describe that to you in two words
[175:22.60]I just tripped.
[175:24.06]He didn't kill me.
[175:24.64]I tripped over a rock and hit my face on the ground.
[175:30.80]Good job.
[175:31.12]You earned five medals.
[175:33.53]So what you're telling me is if that's the card we have there, what was going on there?
[175:38.37]What were you doing?
[175:40.31]I have... Hold on.
[175:41.79]Let us switch to the other screen.
[175:44.40]What happened?
[175:48.34]You can't win every game, Star.
[175:49.08]I have four gold medals.
[175:49.90]The only medal I don't have is objective time.
[175:51.68]You can't win every game, Star.
[175:57.72]Alright.
[175:58.36]I mean, you're just shit-talking.
[175:59.78]You're just saying, oh, I have like five bronze medals.
[176:01.78]Look how good I am.
[176:03.56]You said five gold medals.
[176:05.40]Good.
[176:05.82]Good job.
[176:07.02]Condescendingly.
[176:07.78]And everyone heard it.
[176:11.70]You know, you really need to go get some... You need to get your hand fixed.
[176:14.45]I do.
[176:16.33]Your, like, gamer hand is where your brain is.
[176:18.67]Your brain is inside of your wrist and fingers.
[176:20.69]It's not even in your head.
[176:22.24]Your head is full of cherry jello.
[176:26.14]Nothing up there.
[176:26.62]What the fuck up?
[176:36.16]I'm eating a salad over here.
[176:38.20]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[176:43.42]Hey, Reetbot.
[176:44.72]Thanks, dude.
[176:47.34]Welcome to the champagne drinkers.
[176:48.76]I heard that one.
[177:04.01]That's great.
[177:06.39]Wilson Wells is the best.
[177:11.70]That's not how he does it.
[177:16.92]You do it.
[177:17.38]You need to show me how, like, good you are.
[177:18.76]Like, Jerma's like, oh, I am the number one authority on how guys said things.
[177:23.09]Let's see how good you are at doing it.
[177:25.35]Come on.
[177:26.43]Put up or shut up.
[177:27.15]Put them up or shut up.
[177:31.74]that I want you to do.
[177:32.86]This is what I want him to do, guys.
[177:37.98]You know what I mean?
[177:38.82]It seems like someone's backing down.
[177:41.02]This is what I want him to do.
[177:44.32]I want to get a better vantage point, but you know.
[177:48.47]Those of you that can read that.
[177:54.73]Oh, Jerma doesn't think all of his viewers can read.
[177:58.31]A little condescending.
[178:01.78]Tell me when Reinhardt's shield goes down.
[178:08.39]Ours or theirs?
[178:09.03]Do they have one?
[178:09.69]Theirs.
[178:13.31]Still up.
[178:16.33]Probably going to be up for a long time.
[178:18.29]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[178:23.35]Hey, mom will be proud.
[178:24.85]Oh, my god.
[178:25.69]I picked off, like, three people from behind the shield.
[178:29.25]That's why you just hold it there.
[178:31.21]That's all you do.
[178:34.59]Mom will be so proud.
[178:35.63]Thanks for stopping.
[178:38.85]Freeze.
[178:40.14]Oh, shit.
[178:46.28]That was so close!
[178:50.26]Stop it!
[178:53.44]I hit her too.
[179:01.13]Oh my god.
[179:01.83]No!
[179:01.89]That would have been play of the game if I killed her.
[179:07.67]I'm so super sure of it.
[179:19.09]Nice work.
[179:19.61]I'm gonna make it.
[179:30.95]And... If he didn't jump, I might have actually hurt him.
[179:35.04]Yeah, me too.
[179:36.00]I probably would have killed him.
[179:39.12]I must have my ult.
[179:48.06]Symmetra behind me.
[179:50.75]Ah, the French.
[179:51.87]Bean dip.
[179:52.35]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[179:56.10]Hey, you know what goes good with champagne?
[179:58.52]Bean dip.
[180:02.94]Thanks, dude.
[180:04.58]You know what goes good with Cool Whip?
[180:07.59]I don't know.
[180:07.89]Here, here, wait, wait, wait.
[180:08.53]Come up here, come up here.
[180:09.99]Come here.
[180:10.23]Where?
[180:10.65]Down here, down here.
[180:12.09]Stand, like, right on me.
[180:13.35]Like, right in front of me.
[180:15.29]I can... Let's go!
[180:20.65]It worked the first time.
[180:21.33]I just fucked it up.
[180:23.33]Did you just die?
[180:27.80]That's really impressive stuff, Jerma.
[180:30.98]What did I do differently?
[180:33.46]I think I pushed you back.
[180:34.84]No, no, no.
[180:36.30]I don't think so.
[180:37.79]How did I do that the first time?
[180:38.97]I was trying to cover for you.
[180:39.95]I did...
[180:48.31]See?
[180:48.65]I just fucked it up.
[180:49.73]You didn't expect me to do that, did you?
[180:54.89]I made up for it, see?
[180:59.68]So, what's going on here?
[181:00.34]We got people... God!
[181:03.86]Oh, God.
[181:14.81]Stupid, dumb, dumb...
[181:20.97]It wasn't close enough.
[181:21.69]I think I was compensating for him.
[181:24.14]I wanted to make sure he could do it.
[181:25.84]So I stayed a little further back.
[181:28.80]I have an ult.
[181:29.40]I want to use it.
[181:30.00]Where were you?
[181:33.44]My ultimate.
[181:34.28]Why am I not talking?
[181:35.12]If you can just pull them onto the point.
[181:38.79]I'm... Okay, let's go.
[181:42.55]Kree's dead.
[181:43.03]If you pull them onto the point, I can snipe everybody.
[181:47.75]What do you mean pull them onto the point?
[181:48.99]I'm Mei'd.
[181:50.14]Yeah, like, jump on the point and just, like, baseball and all that shit.
[181:54.80]Ah, the French.
[181:55.98]Champagne has always been celebrated for sexiness.
[181:58.40]I know, that's why you have to fucking go and stand on it.
[182:01.41]Alright, you were missing everything that just happened there.
[182:05.69]When we walked up there, there was a Junkrat and a Reinhardt up there.
[182:09.59]And nobody was standing on the point.
[182:10.85]And I just got murdered.
[182:18.46]Agent Texas!
[182:20.52]Thanks, man.
[182:20.82]All I'm asking for is that Agent Texas be my friend instead of Jerma.
[182:24.36]And then Agent Texas can go stand up, like, just, like, get capture time on you so people have to come fight you.
[182:29.69]Agent Texas isn't a dick.
[182:31.87]Like, for at least two to three hours a day.
[182:35.67]That's the difference that you guys have.
[182:37.81]I do it more than that.
[182:41.69]That's the difference.
[182:43.87]Alright, you ready?
[182:45.51]I'm going to frisbee it in there.
[182:49.83]Hi, guys.
[182:50.39]Behind you, behind you.
[182:52.87]What's going on here?
[182:58.23]It's working.
[183:01.76]Is it not working?
[183:03.04]I don't know.
[183:03.44]I'm the only one person there.
[183:04.26]I don't know why our team didn't follow up, but I sniped everybody who came out.
[183:08.66]I'm the only person standing on the point.
[183:13.12]This fight is not over yet.
[183:16.38]It hasn't.
[183:18.14]No, I'm changing.
[183:19.95]I'm going to go a beefy character.
[183:24.67]We have a lot of beef.
[183:25.51]We need some more damage.
[183:30.24]We need some teamwork.
[183:34.28]Justice ain't going to dispense itself.
[183:40.47]Ah, the French champagne has always been excited for its excellence.
[183:43.85]I mean, I have 15 final blows.
[183:45.73]Tracer behind somewhere.
[183:46.63]I don't know where.
[183:50.35]I can hear her.
[183:51.11]Oh, God.
[183:58.47]Really?
[184:00.41]I don't know.
[184:00.85]I've hit her so many times and I still... It just doesn't even matter.
[184:03.25]She's dead.
[184:05.96]What happened?
[184:07.46]What?
[184:09.60]Did you shoot her?
[184:11.12]Yeah.
[184:12.14]That seems almost impossible for you to do that on my screen.
[184:15.46]I don't know what happened there, but that was kind of cool.
[184:17.49]Well, heard it here first.
[184:18.85]Sterk can make the impossible happen.
[184:23.30]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[184:29.24]Hatchy guy.
[184:30.24]Thanks for subscribing.
[184:32.95]That is good.
[184:33.57]It's fucking me up so much.
[184:36.13]I can't even play the game.
[184:45.22]Ah, DJ Flexboy.
[184:49.86]Thanks for subbing.
[184:50.38]You guys have such impeccable timing with these.
[184:52.24]Kim is a nerd too.
[184:54.06]Do you have them randomized?
[184:56.32]Huh?
[185:09.23]What do you mean randomize?
[185:10.75]Like different sounds are playing.
[185:13.59]No, it's just the same one.
[185:17.31]Like whenever someone subs, it could be like one of 20 different poses.
[185:20.65]You know, like get surprised every time.
[185:22.29]Oh, can you really do that?
[185:23.69]Yeah.
[185:24.11]Oh boy, I can't wait to do that.
[185:26.01]That's going to be amazing.
[185:35.25]I thought she was going to dash, but she didn't.
[185:38.33]I gotta hit her right in the face.
[185:39.13]I have to hit her in the head.
[185:50.67]You heard it here first, guys.
[185:51.83]Starken, hit the impossible.
[185:53.15]Why can't he just live forever?
[186:10.36]No, I can't.
[186:12.56]Orson Welles have just lived forever.
[186:14.00]I don't even care that I'm playing like shit.
[186:19.02]I'm having a great time right now.
[186:20.60]I have my ult.
[186:29.33]I have Deadeye.
[186:29.89]I could Deadeye people if we go in.
[186:31.99]This is the perfect time probably to do it.
[186:35.27]What's going on?
[186:35.69]What's happening here?
[186:44.26]Symmetra.
[186:45.57]Turn around, Symmetra.
[186:47.05]I love donuts.
[186:56.27]How are ya?
[186:57.05]You ready donuts?
[186:58.15]This one's for you, donuts.
[187:02.31]Oh my god!
[187:10.76]I just freaked out.
[187:12.70]I freaked out.
[187:14.00]I couldn't, I froze up.
[187:15.52]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[187:23.54]You're all dead.
[187:24.74]I just missed it.
[187:25.50]Ah, the fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[187:32.21]I love donuts.
[187:33.09]Thanks for subbing.
[187:33.89]Juicy blueberry.
[187:34.91]Thanks for subbing.
[187:35.85]And Utopia Fox.
[187:37.69]Thank you for subbing.
[187:41.58]Paxton TV!
[187:42.74]God, this is like, you guys are something like crazy.
[187:44.46]I don't know what to say, thank you.
[188:09.39]Flowing like my pee.
[188:17.18]I'll never forget that.
[188:18.58]Oh, you heard it here, guys.
[188:20.04]Star can do the impossible.
[188:21.46]Oh, look at that.
[188:22.84]Nice.
[188:45.97]Can I play this other game?
[188:48.47]It has to be available now, right?
[188:52.87]Well, I almost have another box, so let's play again.
[188:58.76]I got you.
[188:59.48]You can honestly say UtopiaFox.
[189:01.30]I've never subscribed to a streamer, but that sub voice broke me.
[189:05.18]Well, thank you for being the first person.
[189:08.74]Well, thank you for letting me be the first person you subbed to.
[189:24.54]Jack the genius.
[189:25.78]Thanks, dude.
[189:30.32]I can't wait.
[189:31.04]I'm so excited now to go and find a million Orson Welles quotes.
[189:37.55]You never know what you're going to get.
[189:41.95]I can't wait to do that.
[189:42.85]That's going to be so much fun.
[189:46.35]It's going to ruin so many games because I'm going to not know either.
[189:50.19]So when it happens, he's going to say something crazy and it's going to make me laugh.
[189:53.53]Because I'm going to put in like a hundred of them.
[189:57.73]You could have the secret bonus Pac-Man one too.
[189:59.68]What do you mean?
[190:03.24]You can actually set them for like if someone resubs a certain amount of months, you can make it different for that too.
[190:07.70]So if someone subs for like 20 months, then you have like the super golden Orson Welles.
[190:15.60]Where you license Orson Welles to say something special.
[190:20.37]You paid him a lot of money.
[190:21.41]I'm not sure you understand that Orson Welles is dead.
[190:24.67]He paid a lot of money.
[190:26.61]Orson Welles paid a lot of money.
[190:29.94]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[190:33.08]BMD 1583.
[190:34.20]That's the guy that just subbed.
[190:39.56]Think that's the year he was born?
[190:42.25]You think Orson Welles was born in 83?
[190:45.43]No.
[190:46.41]BMD was born in 1583.
[190:47.37]I'm gonna get the car.
[190:51.71]I just missed it.
[190:52.67]Oh, that's ice.
[190:53.41]I didn't even know that.
[190:53.89]I had no idea that was ice.
[190:55.41]Oh, that's new.
[190:56.91]I never used to do that.
[190:59.53]The ice breaking effect on the top is totally new.
[191:09.01]19 months should be a Pac-Man zone.
[191:15.29]You're probably going to outbid me, Red Ranger.
[191:17.30]I'm in college and have no money.
[191:20.48]You know, there's no bidding.
[191:21.68]There's no war.
[191:22.26]There's no bidding war.
[191:24.20]You don't have to sub like a million times.
[191:25.90]It's alright.
[191:27.16]Oh, top wine taster of the month.
[191:28.66]Get ready for the top wine taster of the month.
[191:33.46]No.
[191:33.68]Subbing once, you guys have done way more.
[191:37.51]Don't worry about it.
[191:38.25]There's no, like, war.
[191:39.55]A sub is a sub.
[191:44.69]I appreciate any of them.
[191:49.21]Don't shoot me, please.
[191:50.59]Just go ice-skating.
[191:54.42]Jump in, jump in, jump in, jump in.
[191:55.26]Jump in, quick.
[192:09.19]Orson Welles.
[192:10.85]Like, when we're done playing, I might just go on a quest to finally... I need to find something that competes.
[192:17.03]You know?
[192:17.73]Compete with what?
[192:19.39]Orson Welles.
[192:22.11]Did you just hear me say that there's no competitions here?
[192:24.33]What are you talking about?
[192:25.33]I... No, no, no.
[192:26.83]From my sub sound, I need to, like, come up with a... That's a different, entirely different competition.
[192:33.15]Well, who said that's a competition?
[192:35.13]I did.
[192:36.79]You don't have to... Why are you making it a competition?
[192:38.07]You're like a real dumb fuck today.
[192:42.82]What are you talking about?
[192:46.46]Does anybody even understand what he's even trying to say?
[192:53.71]I'm not entirely sure.
[192:57.31]He only subbed because of the sub sound.
[192:59.11]Well, at least you're honest.
[193:00.17]There we go.
[193:05.03]We're going to go ice skating.
[193:10.46]Damn it.
[193:10.74]Why so mean?
[193:11.38]It was a play on...
[193:15.38]No one understands me.
[193:16.56]That's my main problem.
[193:21.14]Superhot is out.
[193:23.44]Is it?
[193:24.02]Was I just lied to?
[193:25.08]Did somebody lie to me?
[193:26.97]I hope I wasn't lied to.
[193:31.79]I hope I wasn't just lied to from somebody in my chat.
[193:34.69]Could have been a troll.
[193:35.51]Could be a troll.
[193:38.33]It's out.
[193:40.69]It's out.
[193:44.46]League of Explorers is out.
[193:47.68]Max out.
[193:48.74]Hog champ.
[193:49.74]Do it.
[193:53.76]Hold on a second.
[193:54.20]I can have it be downloading in the background here.
[194:03.45]Download in the background.
[194:16.06]Okay.
[194:17.85]Hopefully my stream doesn't start to lag because I'm downloading a game in the background.
[194:22.11]Oh, it is.
[194:23.19]Alright, well, hopefully this is just temporary because I'm playing this game and downloading at the same time.
[194:31.43]I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing.
[194:38.52]Is it going?
[194:40.00]It is.
[194:42.25]Alright.
[194:43.13]Well, enjoy the laggy stream for another minute or two.
[194:51.71]Ah, Tracer's going around back.
[195:02.24]He's almost dead.
[195:15.81]Yes, I got him with that.
[195:16.57]Come on, hurry up super hard.
[195:24.04]Hurry up.
[195:24.40]I don't want any more lagginess.
[195:26.25]I like that stun.
[195:27.31]I like that teamwork we had there.
[195:28.97]Stun?
[195:30.05]Shunning?
[195:33.17]Oh, the lag is real.
[195:36.78]It is real.
[195:37.65]Oh, they have double Winston.
[195:39.83]I'm sniping and it's not gonna work ever.
[195:44.06]Let them come.
[195:47.14]Yeah, double Winston, they're double dead.
[195:58.38]None of us hit him.
[195:59.32]I find that to be odd.
[196:01.54]I'm odd.
[196:03.74]I'm odd.
[196:05.54]Seriously, I don't know if I grabbed him.
[196:09.06]My game just lagged.
[196:10.30]Oh, blame it on lag.
[196:16.57]I'm playing fairly well for how bad my frames are dropping right now.
[196:27.38]I'm not.
[196:33.82]There.
[196:33.96]It's at 99%.
[196:34.36]That means I can play without the leg.
[196:38.01]Come on.
[196:38.41]Let's go.
[196:43.51]It's installed.
[196:44.49]Hooray.
[196:45.05]Okay.
[196:46.45]Back to reality.
[196:51.95]Hey.
[196:55.97]Hey.
[196:58.83]That just took a lot of damage.
[197:10.94]Do I have an orb on me?
[197:11.88]Yeah, I have a discord orb on me.
[197:12.94]Oh god.
[197:13.82]I don't know what happened.
[197:21.47]I did not even hit that guy.
[197:22.51]I got him with a chain and I tried to pull him and it didn't pull.
[197:47.67]I wish it was a little bit better to know if you have a... No, I don't have a Discord Orb on me.
[198:03.23]I almost got her.
[198:13.71]Can't follow through on it.
[198:23.99]Let the dragon consume you!
[198:29.48]I thought he was in front of me.
[198:34.96]I thought he was in front of me.
[198:40.27]Take it easy, Ragnar.
[198:43.91]Thanks for stopping by.
[198:45.05]Thanks for coming down.
[198:57.17]I know how happy you are right now.
[198:58.97]Your whole chat's like Jeremamoon.
[199:02.07]I love it.
[199:02.41]There's a McCree right there.
[199:14.88]Oh, we just destroyed him.
[199:16.84]Zarya's hurt.
[199:19.97]And Zarya's dead.
[199:22.46]Two-man team right here.
[199:23.10]You know what I'm talking about?
[199:23.84]You know what I'm talking about?
[199:24.76]Dual lane right here.
[199:26.06]And we're in the dual lane.
[199:26.82]Fucking Kings Row dual lane right here.
[199:28.07]Fucking Kings Row dual lane right here.
[199:31.89]Fucking Kings Row dual lane right here.
[199:33.99]You know what I'm talking about?
[199:34.77]Yeah, I do.
[199:35.39]You know what I'm talking about?
[199:36.11]Kings Row dual lane?
[199:37.21]I can... I heard you.
[199:38.69]I know.
[199:41.12]I think they're going around.
[199:43.06]They're trying to go in the jungle right now.
[199:44.80]You know what I'm talking about?
[199:45.50]Fucking dual lane jungle.
[199:46.64]You're dead.
[199:47.38]I died.
[199:48.32]You overextended, man.
[199:49.82]No.
[199:50.90]I got stuck in a trap and I didn't have my hook up to grab the Lucio.
[199:59.82]Star called German a jerk face for me please.
[200:01.86]Don't even.
[200:02.42]Don't do it.
[200:04.03]Jerk.
[200:04.51]He did it.
[200:05.27]Face.
[200:06.81]Jerk face.
[200:11.19]We're doing fine.
[200:11.69]Hopefully this is a good game to go out on.
[200:14.23]Because then I can turn on super hot.
[200:20.57]Watch out, spread out.
[200:38.30]I killed one guy, he got revived and he instantly died again in one shot.
[200:42.71]Noooo, we can't get in that.
[200:46.40]So much happening on the screen, it's hard to even determine what is going on.
[200:58.06]Got her.
[201:01.92]Kick him while he's down, call him a buttface.
[201:07.96]You're a turd taste tester.
[201:10.32]That's a good one.
[201:11.70]That actually really was a good insult.
[201:14.87]Because I'm not, I'm not actually a turd taste tester.
[201:18.31]No, you're not.
[201:19.05]Champagne has always been celebrated.
[201:20.49]Reckless.
[201:20.99]It's excellent.
[201:21.91]Reckless.
[201:22.85]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[201:29.41]I have had the worst Hanzo.
[201:35.25]Reckless.
[201:37.85]Like Legolas, but a gecko.
[201:41.49]Did I even get anyone?
[201:42.99]I am surprised.
[201:43.41]They're all going in the right door, the small door back up.
[201:55.99]Oh, did you have to have that on you?
[202:04.93]Have I beaten my 20-something kill streak?
[202:07.01]Not this game.
[202:13.18]Not this one.
[202:22.03]I'm going for the total.
[202:28.66]I'm actually quite surprised.
[202:30.44]I'm not even on metal.
[202:31.54]Oh boy, this is not good.
[202:33.44]I've been dealing a lot.
[202:38.08]Not much I could do there.
[202:38.82]Just trying to get him denied.
[202:43.97]Go out the right door.
[202:49.85]They don't expect the right door.
[202:50.79]They always expect the left door.
[203:00.95]I'm just trying to stay alive Is he even alive?
[203:05.03]I guess I trapped him.
[203:05.57]Trapped his ass.
[203:29.93]That's good.
[203:30.31]That's good.
[203:30.65]Cart's moving back.
[203:31.37]We're going to lose anyway.
[203:32.19]There's a minute left.
[203:32.83]We might win.
[203:33.29]We might get this.
[203:38.78]We might do it.
[203:40.28]Stay positive.
[203:41.34]Stick with it.
[203:42.80]And always eat your vegetables.
[203:46.24]We're going to Zarya ult soon.
[203:48.52]Spread out a bit.
[203:49.21]Okay.
[204:05.99]My Hanzo's been on point.
[204:06.87]What the hell?
[204:08.09]It was on top of her head?
[204:09.61]Minus the ults.
[204:12.19]I was standing on her head.
[204:16.57]Kree's dead.
[204:18.59]He's gonna nerf this?
[204:37.41]I'm just keeping them off.
[204:38.09]I'm just stuffing them right now.
[204:40.85]That's good.
[204:44.41]That's good.
[204:45.09]Was that enough?
[204:46.29]They can't make it, right?
[204:50.93]Did anybody get to the cart?
[204:52.95]Yeah, they got here eventually.
[204:55.83]Really?
[204:56.13]I ulted too.
[204:58.53]I tried to keep them off, but they have Zarya on their team.
[205:08.66]oh I think we lost yeah that's really unfortunate I was certain we were gonna win right there yeah I think I should have held off on my ult a little longer I figured that when I they were just being stuffed and it was like three seconds yeah then they like desperately all in one club tried to walk around the side so I was like oh I'm gonna dragon I did it I think too early and kanzari just shielded everybody and didn't really even do anything no well
[205:38.58]That was still a good game to go out on.
[205:40.38]Yes, it was.
[205:43.45]I mean, when you heal the damage that people did to you, boy, am I impressed.
[205:48.89]I did good.
[205:52.77]I was getting good hooks.
[205:59.74]Well, is that enough for a box?
[206:02.42]Please tell me it was.
[206:03.74]It was.
[206:10.43]Alright, let's open the box.
[206:12.83]Open the box.
[206:14.58]Let's hope it's another legendary.
[206:15.94]It's an epic.
[206:16.74]Oh, I already have this.
[206:22.96]Oh, it's an emote!
[206:26.22]Now that's awesome.
[206:28.84]I'm glad I have a sick Winston skin and his emote.
[206:34.48]Let's see what his butt looks like when he does it.
[206:35.90]Nice.
[206:37.54]Nice.
[206:41.23]Victory pose.
[206:41.97]Yeah, put it on.
[206:45.25]No, I like the pig one.
[206:46.19]I don't want to take that off.
[206:48.54]No, I like the bomb.
[206:53.06]Okay, well.
[206:54.94]We're going to switch games.
[206:57.18]We're going to play Superhot.
[206:59.30]I don't know how long I'm going to stream it for.
[207:02.78]But... Maybe like the first few levels?
[207:05.48]I don't know.
[207:06.18]We'll see, guys.
[207:07.98]Because I'm hungry.
[207:08.80]I need to get food.
[207:10.80]I didn't think I was going to be streaming this long in the first place.
[207:14.92]So, I'm going to go to Superhot.
[207:17.72]And you open up the game and the stream in.
[207:20.72]Well, that would... Oh, you mean like turn it off, right?
[207:23.31]Like a joke.
[207:24.19]Yeah.
[207:24.99]Like the game opens up like, hey guys, you can answer.
[207:29.01]That would be really mean.
[207:33.21]Okay, let me open it.
[207:36.01]Change some settings on it.
[207:42.96]Super hot.
[207:45.24]That's the one.
[207:48.57]That's like when I make a pot pie and you can't eat it for the first three minutes.
[207:52.33]Yeah, it kind of is.
[207:53.79]This might be really loud.
[207:54.59]Turn down your headphones right now.
[207:56.09]It's going to be loud.
[208:02.62]It always is.
[208:15.72]Superhot.
[208:19.14]Did that work?
[208:24.86]What the hell is this?
[208:25.70]Is this supposed to be a first-person shooter?
[208:38.69]You playing Superhot yet?
[208:39.81]I've never seen anything like it.
[208:42.05]Hold on.
[208:45.43]I need to change my stream title, because right now it's a lie.
[209:04.55]Uh, time... Time FPS game.
[209:09.14]Time FPS game.
[209:16.80]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[209:21.42]Typical anomaly.
[209:31.22]Thanks for subbing.
[209:35.07]All right.
[209:36.47]Let's get into this.
[209:37.07]What are you talking about?
[209:37.81]Sure.
[209:38.71]Superhot.exe.
[209:40.15]It's a crack.
[209:43.00]Logs you into this company's site so you can play this game.
[209:47.72]Sick shooter.
[209:51.01]I was trying to write, fuck you.
[209:55.79]Should I just leave the chat?
[209:56.91]I feel like I shouldn't.
[210:02.03]What?
[210:02.21]This intro's funny.
[210:11.75]Check it out.
[210:12.21]Just run superhot.exe.
[210:13.47]One of these is... You're going to send me an EXE in an email?
[210:19.23]Don't ever click that.
[210:19.91]Are you serious?
[210:23.09]Yeah, read me.
[210:25.03]Here are the settings.
[210:27.99]Audio.
[210:30.69]Go down.
[210:31.87]That's better.
[210:35.49]That's better?
[210:36.33]Better, right?
[210:47.64]That's better.
[210:51.84]We're going to go with that.
[210:56.80]Gamma.
[210:58.37]Preset.
[211:00.51]I'm in 1920x1080.
[211:00.79]I already picked that.
[211:04.19]What the fuck is this?
[211:05.73]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[211:10.33]Fox of Fury.
[211:11.83]Welcome to the champagne toasters.
[211:15.58]Uh, whatever.
[211:16.26]This is fine.
[211:18.16]If it's bad, it's bad, and we'll try something else.
[211:20.54]What about, like, FOV?
[211:21.56]Is there an FOV slider?
[211:28.55]Your fob.
[211:30.13]Apps?
[211:31.33]Hey, dude, what's your fob?
[211:32.17]Carpets.exe.
[211:32.83]This is actually confusing me.
[211:35.67]Games?
[211:36.25]VR?
[211:36.97]Art?
[211:37.17]This is supposed to be a dog?
[211:45.29]I don't know what any of this means.
[211:53.17]Tree Dude?
[211:53.87]I'm gonna play Tree Dude.
[211:56.23]His name is Tree Dude.
[211:59.95]And his song is... I thought this was a first person shooter.
[212:16.99]I lost the game.
[212:20.46]Chop left, chop right.
[212:21.70]Oh, I get it.
[212:24.84]Hold on.
[212:25.64]Just wrecking this.
[212:49.34]What's this one?
[212:52.84]Tree Dude music is still playing.
[212:55.55]Tree Dude!
[212:57.15]How do I turn off Tree Dude's music?
[213:03.17]How do I turn it off?
[213:06.29]Help!
[213:07.67]Get me outta here!
[213:10.79]Tree Dude!
[213:11.47]Shut up!
[213:12.59]Tree Dude!
[213:18.58]Oh my god!
[213:19.58]Do I have to exit the game?
[213:29.61]That's the stream.
[213:34.59]No, get... Super hot.
[213:40.01]I really hope TreeDude's not gonna keep playing through this whole game.
[213:44.77]Here we go.
[213:51.76]It stopped.
[213:56.31]My computer broke.
[213:58.21]Oh!
[213:59.99]Move with WASD.
[214:01.79]Aim with the mouse.
[214:06.64]That's really cool.
[214:08.22]Time moves only when you move.
[214:13.02]Oh!
[214:14.82]Left click to shoot.
[214:17.80]I guess I have to move.
[214:20.64]Look at the bullets coming.
[214:21.86]I threw the gun.
[214:23.18]I just threw the gun at him.
[214:25.15]Oh, shit.
[214:27.27]I got him in the head.
[214:27.89]Here comes another guy.
[214:29.21]I need my gun back.
[214:33.15]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[214:37.13]Green scrubzor.
[214:38.13]This guy's going to shoot me right in the head.
[214:40.13]Thanks for subbing, Green.
[214:43.01]You can dodge them?
[214:43.91]I got to pick up my gun.
[214:44.71]Can I punch him in the face?
[214:48.85]God!
[214:53.39]I have to be very slow.
[214:57.16]He's so close.
[214:58.06]Can I crouch?
[214:59.92]Is it going to hit me right in the head?
[215:09.36]Holy!
[215:10.97]This is the scariest game ever.
[215:12.91]Why did I throw the gun at him?
[215:18.69]It's so close.
[215:19.63]It's so far away.
[215:23.51]Give me the gun.
[215:26.01]I'm dead.
[215:29.03]This is crazy.
[215:30.63]This is absolutely crazy.
[215:32.29]Don't throw the gun this time.
[215:33.21]I right clicked.
[215:36.88]Time moves when you move.
[215:43.88]Do I have to reload?
[215:45.92]What is that?
[215:46.24]Oh, hold to restart.
[215:47.20]Okay.
[215:52.25]This bullet travel too, this is crazy, guys.
[215:54.89]This is insanity.
[215:55.63]I'm having so much fun.
[215:58.47]Super hot.
[216:00.64]Super hot.
[216:02.68]Super hot.
[216:04.70]Super hot.
[216:06.72]Super hot.
[216:08.74]Super hot.
[216:10.56]Super hot.
[216:12.63]Okay.
[216:15.51]I gotta click to move out of the tutorial?
[216:19.47]Grab the gun.
[216:21.57]Left click picks up weapons.
[216:28.16]So he's going to be running straight at me.
[216:29.68]This guy's running this way, so I'm going to have to shoot right here.
[216:32.58]Yep.
[216:34.72]Missed him.
[216:38.96]He's right in my face.
[216:39.70]I've got to point black right in the head.
[216:42.75]Done.
[216:44.99]These guys are trying to fight me.
[216:45.79]Got him.
[216:49.51]It was a setup.
[216:50.89]I don't know what that means.
[216:51.51]Here comes another guy.
[216:53.55]I think star left.
[216:56.53]Alright.
[216:56.75]Obviously, you have to shoot the guy with the gun first, right?
[217:00.19]So, what's... Is he just running straight?
[217:02.49]Kind of to the left a little bit?
[217:06.30]Nope.
[217:06.62]He was running just straight.
[217:07.78]User joined your channel.
[217:08.78]User left your channel.
[217:09.50]User joined your channel.
[217:10.84]User joined your channel.
[217:11.82]Oh, would you stop this?
[217:14.90]Would you stop?
[217:17.14]There's no reason for it.
[217:21.70]Got him.
[217:26.44]I just did this.
[217:28.91]So what happens if I do... If I pick this up... And just... What if I just play like it's an actual FPS?
[217:33.59]Just actually move around?
[217:35.69]Let's go.
[217:43.47]Fuck, he hit me!
[217:47.30]Did I accidentally press R?
[217:49.54]Let's go.
[217:55.71]So there is no reloading.
[217:56.69]That's what it is.
[218:01.48]Oops.
[218:02.76]He shot the gun.
[218:04.22]He shot the gun.
[218:06.72]This is such a brain.
[218:09.02]My brain is having trouble.
[218:11.88]Well, I just missed.
[218:14.61]How did I miss that?
[218:15.25]Okay, I gotta watch out.
[218:20.41]This guy shoots immediately.
[218:28.68]Shit, he's getting too close.
[218:31.39]Where's his bullet?
[218:35.53]I'm out of ammo.
[218:40.35]Oh, I got it right in the head.
[218:42.91]Can I pick up his gun?
[218:45.95]Cool.
[218:51.17]Okay, that was kind of cool.
[218:55.01]You can get the first two in one, but the bolts just go through.
[218:58.04]Take it slow.
[219:02.62]Anything behind me?
[219:03.78]No.
[219:07.32]Alright, I'll just hug this wall.
[219:13.28]They're not aiming at me yet.
[219:14.90]Now I can grab the gun.
[219:15.84]There goes a guy on the left.
[219:30.09]Can I shoot this guy too?
[219:33.95]Got him.
[219:37.57]Let's keep going.
[219:41.55]You can also hit bullets out of the air with thrown weapons?
[219:44.11]That's insane.
[219:49.13]I thought I... Okay.
[219:51.79]So I gotta throw the weapon immediately.
[219:55.82]So grab this gun.
[220:06.67]Wasn't on point with that one.
[220:12.26]Oh shit, more people.
[220:18.82]Is that guy gonna stand still?
[220:19.64]I'm out of ammo.
[220:26.31]Okay, his gun's over there.
[220:28.95]Make a run for it.
[220:31.39]Is he going for the gun too?
[220:32.25]He's going for the gun.
[220:48.10]That didn't hit him.
[220:51.94]How did the first one not hit him?
[220:58.57]Edit the replay?
[221:00.47]So you can actually save replays?
[221:01.63]These people are going to do insane stuff with this game.
[221:08.55]Left click to stun enemies in melee range.
[221:13.62]That's so cool.
[221:18.00]This is amazing.
[221:23.04]Oh, boy.
[221:27.91]Can I hit him with the... Can I stun him with the gun?
[221:30.27]Can I, like, pistol hit him?
[221:33.29]No, I just shoot him in the face.
[221:37.96]I'm going to throw it at that guy.
[221:39.40]Grab the gun over here.
[221:41.49]Turn around and shoot this guy.
[221:43.09]Throw the gun.
[221:44.57]Sponge.
[221:44.99]Stun him.
[221:46.21]Grab gun.
[221:47.25]Flip around here.
[221:47.89]Shoot.
[221:48.89]Stun.
[221:50.23]Dead.
[221:52.91]Alright, first of all, I'm going to stun him.
[221:58.41]Where's the gun?
[221:59.69]Where's the gun?
[222:00.07]His gun's gone.
[222:03.61]They get hit by trains.
[222:07.83]There's the gun.
[222:08.37]Give me it.
[222:12.79]Two guys coming from over here.
[222:16.74]He's shooting right now.
[222:18.02]Trajectory.
[222:18.98]Got him.
[222:23.72]One more guy.
[222:24.96]Fade.
[222:25.26]Out of bullets.
[222:27.32]Stunning.
[222:28.36]Punching.
[222:30.26]Grabbing gun.
[222:30.84]Shooting.
[222:32.12]Stunning.
[222:34.50]Punch!
[222:35.68]Got him.
[222:37.99]Okay, I gotta punch this guy.
[222:41.55]Nobody else, right?
[222:42.15]Does that gun have any bullets?
[222:51.34]He's so close.
[222:52.10]Can I punch him right now?
[222:57.24]That's how you do it.
[223:00.18]You need like eight throwing guns.
[223:07.06]There's nobody here.
[223:12.30]Hello?
[223:14.22]Unauthorized access.
[223:18.93]To what?
[223:21.61]Good thing you have puke vision now.
[223:25.61]Ugh.
[223:28.63]I did not like that.
[223:29.59]I don't like this either.
[223:33.44]Incoming message.
[223:38.21]What did you think?
[223:44.27]I actually have to pretend to type, guys.
[223:45.79]Watch this.
[223:48.23]Interesting idea.
[223:49.03]Not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, though.
[223:50.65]I think I was in a factory, then an alley, then a subway.
[223:54.86]I love the pretend typing.
[223:57.90]Everyone gets something different.
[224:00.60]It's crazy.
[224:02.44]Oh, let me tell you.
[224:03.40]That's one word for it.
[224:04.76]Enter.
[224:07.93]Super hot commentary.
[224:08.91]You only talk when you move.
[224:10.12]I'll try it.
[224:12.62]Some bad glitches at the end there.
[224:14.02]Unauthorized something or whatever.
[224:16.32]I got kicked out.
[224:17.50]I got kicked, dude.
[224:18.24]I got banned.
[224:18.85]I was AFK.
[224:21.83]Oh, yeah.
[224:22.01]They updated the crack to fix that.
[224:26.65]Okay.
[224:28.42]Do I dare try to do anything else on this menu?
[224:35.59]New file seems to crash less often.
[224:37.29]Is the audio fine too?
[224:38.49]Can you guys hear what's going on in the background?
[224:41.41]I feel like I dropped it a little too much.
[224:49.09]Get over.
[224:49.64]Hold space to jump.
[225:09.46]Okay space what he didn't Joe Better how's that?
[225:31.63]It's a little bit louder
[225:38.82]Get over it.
[225:39.50]Hold space.
[225:49.43]Who keeps doing this?
[225:54.63]Stop joining.
[225:55.19]I'm leaving.
[225:55.81]Is that car gonna turn around?
[225:59.82]No, you gotta get out of it.
[226:07.52]He's not dead.
[226:15.95]Okay, I can only talk when I move.
[226:20.25]I jumped over it.
[226:20.89]That's bullshit.
[226:21.97]That's going to be way too hard.
[226:22.71]I can't do that right now.
[226:32.18]Oh, come on.
[226:37.56]This is freaking me out.
[226:47.36]That guy gets out of the car.
[226:55.59]Come on!
[227:03.01]Wait for him to shoot the first bullet.
[227:04.11]There it is.
[227:08.14]Shit.
[227:12.44]Shit.
[227:12.78]Shit.
[227:15.24]Shit.
[227:17.74]Shit.
[227:19.20]What is that noise?
[227:19.72]There's another guy.
[227:24.96]There's another guy.
[227:43.29]There he is.
[227:43.69]I almost just walked into that one.
[227:50.33]Did I hit him?
[227:50.77]Okay, there's another guy over here.
[228:02.12]Did I get him?
[228:03.98]This doesn't have any bullets, I don't think.
[228:05.22]They only have like two or three shots.
[228:06.99]Fucking, I was testing it and I'm... It's gonna do a kitty corner.
[228:13.01]There's nobody else like wrapping around me.
[228:14.11]I mean, I could go grab that, but no.
[228:15.37]We're going for the throw.
[228:18.09]There's so many people here now.
[228:20.73]I missed.
[228:23.11]He's gonna come around and punch me.
[228:26.99]Not punch me, shoot me.
[228:29.53]I'm going for the gun.
[228:36.25]There's no way I'm surviving this.
[228:37.63]Not a chance.
[228:40.15]He shot one of his own buddies.
[228:41.39]He shot the guy in the back.
[228:42.35]I didn't have to do anything.
[228:47.48]I want that gun!
[228:48.06]Give me the gun!
[228:57.34]Are you serious?
[228:59.30]You just tried to get out of the way of that?
[229:00.94]God, if he shot his friend.
[229:09.63]I'm so angry.
[229:13.55]Give me the gun.
[229:15.21]Fuck you.
[229:15.69]I have to...
[229:23.08]I feel like you'd have a much easier time if you didn't aim for everyone's heads.
[229:27.66]Like a much easier time.
[229:29.56]Oh my god, you're right.
[229:32.70]Oh my god, I don't have to hit people in the head, do I?
[229:35.33]You're right.
[229:35.93]Oh my god.
[229:38.89]I'm just trying to help, man.
[229:39.93]Oh my god, you're right.
[229:40.99]Yeah, guns do damage no matter where you hit a person.
[229:44.35]Oh my god.
[229:45.05]Oh my god, he's right.
[229:49.03]I don't have to hit people in the head.
[229:59.70]Everything had to be a headshot for no reason.
[230:03.98]Oh, that's so funny.
[230:11.45]Well, the tutorial was like, oh, get this guy in the head.
[230:14.65]And it was just burned in my brain forever.
[230:15.79]You're fighting zombies.
[230:19.37]Seriously, like I'm fighting zombies.
[230:21.85]Your chat's so bad.
[230:26.79]Oh, this is a lot more difficult than it seems.
[230:38.83]Give me the controller.
[230:41.39]Really, it's trying to figure out where they're going to run.
[230:44.43]Okay, I got that guy.
[230:47.75]The guy appears over here, right?
[230:51.79]There's a guy right there.
[230:53.75]He's moving.
[230:54.23]Got him.
[231:00.29]Okay.
[231:01.89]I've figured out the trajectory, sort of.
[231:14.28]Oh, you don't have any idea.
[231:15.10]That was terrifying.
[231:16.20]I did not expect him just to be right here.
[231:24.48]That's it, right?
[231:25.10]No one else is going to creep up on me, are they?
[231:26.52]Am I out of bullets?
[231:38.23]Fuck.
[231:40.55]Fuck.
[231:42.53]Fuck.
[231:43.83]Fuck.
[231:51.58]Okay, so how do I... Click to hand the control over, press F5 to edit the replay.
[231:55.83]Alright, we're gonna edit the replay.
[232:00.31]No, I don't want to upload it.
[232:04.17]Playback control, okay.
[232:11.76]How do you... Can you just play it from the beginning?
[232:18.25]Here we go.
[232:18.49]Look at that.
[232:22.31]Look at how cool that looks.
[232:24.53]Bang.
[232:24.89]I did the turn around.
[232:26.07]Bang.
[232:26.27]Got that guy.
[232:27.73]Double shot here.
[232:30.23]Look at how many times I turned around.
[232:33.67]That's funny.
[232:34.99]Super hot.
[232:37.01]Super hot.
[232:38.17]I have a feeling this is going to get even worse.
[232:42.79]They get like shotguns and shoot guns and everything?
[232:44.85]Probably.
[232:45.33]Yeah.
[232:46.76]Right at the bar.
[232:49.22]I got three objects in front of me.
[232:51.44]We are talking about bottling this guy right in the mouth.
[232:54.02]Done.
[232:55.98]Pass that.
[232:57.18]Grab another bottle.
[232:58.72]This guy.
[233:00.02]Bang.
[233:00.78]Nope.
[233:01.00]Missed him.
[233:01.60]Got him.
[233:02.04]Shoot this guy.
[233:05.97]Shoot his friend.
[233:10.55]Shoot his other friend.
[233:12.95]I missed.
[233:13.87]No, I didn't.
[233:18.24]Oh, no.
[233:20.54]Slow down.
[233:25.07]I can't look.
[233:25.59]Even if I look.
[233:26.41]If I look to the left, it's going to make time go forward.
[233:30.33]No ammo.
[233:34.53]Nobody behind me.
[233:40.79]Where is it?
[233:41.11]Oh!
[233:54.90]What did I do?
[233:57.06]I tried to pick it up.
[233:59.18]Fucking stupid fucking game.
[234:04.70]Whoops.
[234:05.24]Get him in the leg.
[234:13.55]Get him in the leg.
[234:16.45]For the love of God.
[234:21.12]Got him.
[234:23.05]Nice.
[234:24.21]Is that not it?
[234:25.45]Is that not it?
[234:37.11]Empty.
[234:41.85]Is that guy still alive?
[234:48.66]Unbelievable.
[234:50.81]Look at this nonsense.
[234:59.08]That seemed way more difficult than it really was.
[235:21.37]Left click to use melee weapons.
[235:23.47]Now you're talking.
[235:25.15]Now you're talking.
[235:26.07]Where's mine?
[235:28.63]Where's mine?
[235:35.73]Why did I not get one?
[235:42.93]You didn't even have one.
[235:47.71]Okay.
[235:52.50]Who's closest?
[235:53.92]Wrap him around.
[235:54.50]Get this guy's... Hit this dude.
[235:59.60]What?
[235:59.80]Are these guys gonna shoot?
[236:14.35]I'm scared.
[236:22.62]Got it.
[236:24.20]Oh my god.
[236:24.76]Okay.
[236:24.92]I'm gonna grab his and then hit him.
[236:35.09]Throw it.
[236:36.87]Punch him.
[236:37.81]Punch this guy.
[236:40.31]Bang.
[236:53.51]Look at this.
[236:54.15]This is... That was so awkward.
[237:01.37]That was so awkward.
[237:05.65]Unfinished business.
[237:08.17]Am I beating this guy up in the bathroom?
[237:09.55]I don't understand.
[237:16.09]His head's in the toilet now.
[237:24.96]Are you seriously still up?
[237:28.28]That guy's got a shotgun.
[237:29.52]Get a pool cue.
[237:31.52]Hold on.
[237:42.39]Give me the bottle.
[237:42.89]Sprint!
[237:46.41]Sprinting!
[237:48.23]Running!
[237:50.51]I'm behind the slot machines.
[237:54.02]I have a chance.
[237:55.22]Peek out.
[237:56.06]In the head.
[237:58.10]Break him!
[238:00.76]That's a shotgun.
[238:01.32]Give me the shotgun!
[238:02.75]Fuck you!
[238:08.83]That's so awesome that you can see all the pellets come out of the shotgun.
[238:19.28]Oh my god, the guy... Okay, that's a good strategy though.
[238:22.83]I like that.
[238:23.21]This guy's easy.
[238:26.41]This guy's easy.
[238:27.29]The guy behind the counter just hit him right in the head.
[238:38.16]You gotta be shi-
[238:48.10]What?
[238:48.28]That came out so quickly!
[238:51.76]Just gonna run.
[238:52.32]Did I hit him?
[239:07.43]Right in the forearm.
[239:16.12]Hope there's nobody behind me because I know a guy spawns right here.
[239:28.93]This guy comes in.
[239:29.67]I've got to not miss this.
[239:32.47]This is really important.
[239:34.07]Okay, now he's going to drop the shotgun.
[239:38.30]He picked up the shotgun.
[239:39.88]Okay, he dropped the shotgun again.
[239:42.85]They just keep picking it up over and over again.
[239:44.45]I just am not doing this correctly.
[239:46.19]He picked it up again.
[239:46.87]Alright, bought me some time.
[239:52.03]I got a ball bat.
[239:52.73]I got a ball bat.
[240:00.11]Something in that room.
[240:00.65]There's stuff in that room.
[240:09.58]Ay-yi-yi!
[240:12.75]Okay, three guys come from that right area.
[240:15.20]I need to go in the room.
[240:17.52]That left room, I have to hit this guy.
[240:19.52]We're just going to keep running.
[240:20.86]Forget about trying to get his shotgun.
[240:25.76]Okay, he shoots.
[240:27.16]Here they come.
[240:28.58]Let them get in here.
[240:29.38]I hope he didn't shoot again.
[240:32.24]He did.
[240:32.46]And he shot me right in the fucking face.
[240:47.73]He... I was running that way, to the right.
[240:50.21]Why would he do that?
[240:57.11]Grab this.
[240:58.67]I'm gonna do what I did before.
[241:00.29]Let's go that.
[241:01.11]Bait the first one, bait the second one.
[241:02.77]Hit him.
[241:03.49]Grab the pool cue.
[241:04.91]This way.
[241:05.57]This guy, right in the chest.
[241:07.93]Coffee cup.
[241:08.61]Where's this gun?
[241:10.91]Somebody's coming behind me.
[241:11.59]Stop moving!
[241:12.03]Give me the gun.
[241:17.34]No.
[241:18.04]Gun.
[241:18.78]No.
[241:19.46]Gun.
[241:19.78]No.
[241:20.69]Gun.
[241:21.03]Gun.
[241:21.23]Give me the gun.
[241:22.19]I can't move.
[241:48.03]I didn't hit him He picked up the gun again Okay, I'm safe I'm safe for now I gotta play this real smart
[242:18.53]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[242:25.78]Thank God.
[242:26.86]Give me the gun.
[242:37.99]I'm so lucky.
[242:52.01]I don't know if I can do this anymore.
[242:53.19]This is hurting me, my whole body.
[243:03.73]I turned around right here, watch this.
[243:05.87]Boom, bullet went right by my face.
[243:12.67]I've never been more terrified in my whole life.
[243:14.69]Break in.
[243:19.47]Make sure, okay, shot, that's where I just was.
[243:27.54]Got the gun right there.
[243:30.78]Ooh!
[243:31.67]Quitting time?
[243:32.19]What does that mean?
[243:38.84]Somebody shot, and I don't know who it was.
[243:40.20]It wasn't that guy right in front of me.
[243:41.42]Somebody's behind me.
[243:54.35]Just hit him.
[243:55.01]Hit him!
[243:56.09]No, that's a good strategy.
[243:56.99]Just weave in and out and then hit him.
[243:58.03]But you still have the bat.
[244:00.25]I'll get it.
[244:00.51]And then this guy.
[244:06.25]Bat him.
[244:07.17]Gun.
[244:08.51]Shoot.
[244:09.29]Penis.
[244:11.27]Didn't hit him.
[244:15.84]Somebody spawned right here.
[244:18.88]Yeah, I knew it.
[244:19.70]I knew there was going to be somebody behind me.
[244:24.08]That guy's got a katana.
[244:26.82]There's a guy right here with a gun.
[244:33.85]He picked up a gun.
[244:37.21]Thankfully.
[244:37.69]Okay, give me the katana.
[244:40.07]Another guy.
[244:40.43]Another guy with a shotgun!
[244:53.56]Oh, the glass shattering actually makes him go wow.
[244:59.49]How did they not get hit by that?
[245:05.59]I think I might be in a better position here.
[245:09.32]Unbelievable.
[245:11.62]Unbelievable that I didn't die from that.
[245:14.98]I think I hit the guy behind him.
[245:16.22]Nope.
[245:17.66]Yeah, I got him this time.
[245:21.08]The gun just went nowhere.
[245:24.06]I'm gonna hit this guy with the beaker, I think.
[245:28.51]Yep, shotgun.
[245:33.77]Oh my god!
[245:34.53]Oh my god!
[245:42.00]That would have been so cool if I had actually done it.
[245:44.40]But I just don't.
[245:45.16]I didn't know where he was gonna come from.
[245:54.79]There's a guy who comes over here.
[245:55.97]Get over here.
[246:00.27]Oh, no.
[246:02.35]Don't shoot.
[246:03.05]Don't shoot.
[246:03.83]Don't shoot.
[246:05.29]Do not shoot your gun.
[246:16.14]I got the bullet.
[246:16.58]Easy.
[246:17.92]Easy.
[246:18.94]Easy.
[246:21.69]Hit the guy right in the palm.
[246:23.57]Somebody else is coming.
[246:24.09]I don't know where they are.
[246:24.67]I don't know.
[246:24.95]There's a guy with a shotgun right here, right?
[246:27.23]Oh, no.
[246:27.95]I've messed it up.
[246:29.87]I'm so busy concerned about the guy with the shotgun.
[246:32.45]Oh, no.
[246:33.09]No, he's going for the gun.
[246:34.35]Oh, no.
[246:40.11]Don't shoot me.
[246:41.59]Don't shoot me.
[246:42.67]Don't shoot me.
[246:45.81]God.
[246:51.29]Don't do it.
[246:53.95]It's too hard.
[246:55.46]It's too much.
[247:02.22]I win.
[247:03.04]Thank God he blew his friend to smithereens.
[247:05.34]Right here.
[247:08.05]It's this right here.
[247:08.95]This guy.
[247:20.66]It's only going to get worse.
[247:22.34]That was great.
[247:24.42]Wrong turn.
[247:28.11]There's a car coming.
[247:29.79]There's a car coming.
[247:31.27]Can I crouch underneath it?
[247:35.57]I have to turn and run, don't I?
[247:37.30]Yep.
[247:42.04]That was crazy.
[247:44.40]Someone's going to get out of the car and I'm going to punch him.
[247:54.93]Follow it.
[247:55.59]Follow it.
[248:02.73]That guy's a machine gun.
[248:05.27]I believe that's an SMG.
[248:06.57]This guy has.
[248:11.64]He's still shooting it.
[248:13.08]I hope that's the only guy.
[248:13.86]Gotta get him right in his big toe.
[248:19.66]I hit the corner of the mudflap.
[248:22.93]I'm going to have to play this really carefully.
[248:24.63]I'm going to weave in and out of traffic here with these bullets.
[248:29.85]Just to get close enough.
[248:35.42]Close enough to punch him right in the head.
[248:44.16]Close enough.
[248:46.14]You...
[248:56.73]I'm going to get hit.
[249:00.31]I'm going to get hit.
[249:03.19]Turn.
[249:03.55]Run.
[249:03.65]Does that guy have a gun?
[249:07.33]No, he doesn't.
[249:14.06]Run, run, run, run, run.
[249:17.28]Bottles.
[249:18.96]Just spam them.
[249:20.96]Just spam them.
[249:21.64]Spam the bottles.
[249:22.54]Got them.
[249:29.02]That is what you have to do.
[249:33.36]Got ya!
[249:40.33]Oh no.
[249:46.21]I did not know that was going to happen.
[249:47.27]I thought this was just teaching me about the new techniques.
[249:51.39]I'm dead here.
[250:21.51]That... I was going to say, how did that not hit him?
[250:24.95]What the f... Where?
[250:26.65]From where?
[250:27.01]I want to see the replay.
[250:27.61]Do they show the replay?
[250:28.27]Because I want to see it.
[250:29.51]No, they don't.
[250:30.09]They're not showing the replay.
[250:33.60]So I can't shoot a thousand times at this guy.
[250:38.50]I fucked it up.
[250:39.04]I went the wrong way anyways.
[250:44.06]I have to go here.
[250:51.45]Don't waste all those bullets.
[250:53.89]Shoot him once, and then you got... It's shooting automatically.
[251:05.30]Okay.
[251:06.90]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[251:10.84]Riley2000, thanks for subbing, man.
[251:15.15]See?
[251:15.59]Even Ocean Wells thinks it was good.
[251:20.68]Now what?
[251:20.98]It's going to be a glitch.
[251:22.49]Everything's going to glitch out.
[251:23.51]And I'm going to talk to my friend over the internet again.
[251:26.65]Well, man, something happened.
[251:27.83]It was a glitch.
[251:29.97]I started to taste blood in my mouth.
[251:31.27]What was that all about, man?
[251:32.59]Fix your code.
[251:33.23]I'm just going to look at a wall when this happens.
[251:45.72]What am I going to complain about now?
[251:52.50]Look who's back.
[251:54.02]I've been trying to reach you for hours.
[251:57.85]You've been playing this whole time?
[251:59.41]Yeah.
[252:02.75]Didn't feel like it was that long.
[252:06.19]I know.
[252:06.91]Felt the same way when I first played the game.
[252:09.91]Couldn't stop.
[252:12.23]It's kind of random.
[252:13.49]No plot, no reason for anything.
[252:14.75]Just killing red guys.
[252:17.55]We're getting meta here.
[252:20.03]Well, that's right.
[252:20.83]Seems that way at first.
[252:24.06]Something happens eventually.
[252:25.44]I don't want to spoil anything, but I guess it doesn't matter now.
[252:32.96]They added more levels, but they're password protected.
[252:37.30]DLC.
[252:37.76]Paid DLC?
[252:38.20]Kidding me?
[252:38.78]Just bought the game.
[252:39.32]Seriously, that sucks.
[252:42.80]Yeah, super lame.
[252:44.62]I'll send anyway.
[252:45.80]Let me know if you figure out how to get in.
[252:49.24]I gotta crack the code now.
[252:51.84]Do I have to play the other little minigames?
[252:55.41]Password protected.
[252:57.29]Okay, so I'm assuming... I need a password here.
[253:07.96]I thought this was paid DLC.
[253:10.12]What's going on?
[253:12.40]Enter authorized password.
[253:21.34]Okay, it's not dog shit eater.
[253:23.10]Okay.
[253:23.20]Okay.
[253:27.39]Well, I don't know it.
[253:34.55]What?
[253:34.89]What?
[253:36.17]What?
[253:36.77]What?
[253:39.39]That has to be just part of the game, right?
[253:40.67]Because I punched in random keys.
[253:42.47]That has to be part of the game.
[253:46.82]I don't... I would never believe that.
[253:48.56]That I got it like that.
[253:57.27]They cracked the system.
[254:00.81]Did they now?
[254:01.41]Where are they?
[254:01.85]There they are.
[254:11.68]There's a rifle.
[254:12.64]There's a bunch of rifles.
[254:17.92]Oh, you are going to sneak around.
[254:21.76]Shit.
[254:23.51]Pre-recorded.
[254:25.59]Is there anything I can hear?
[254:26.77]Anything I can hear use for a weapon?
[254:28.81]Probably not.
[254:31.41]I need to get to this before this guy does.
[254:36.46]Yes, I do.
[254:44.12]What's happening?
[254:47.24]Okay, get rid of that gun.
[254:48.12]Give me a new one.
[254:51.68]Who's next?
[254:53.89]I should have gotten both of them, right?
[254:55.51]Give me a new gun.
[254:59.01]I'm advancing time way too fast.
[255:05.58]Hi.
[255:08.24]Got it.
[255:14.56]That was a really uninteresting replay.
[255:16.50]We don't even need to watch it.
[255:20.89]Plays Reaper, new shotguns every shot.
[255:25.79]Determining breach location.
[255:30.50]Is this like a government conspiracy?
[255:32.08]What was that guy?
[255:36.94]We can see you.
[255:37.70]Who's watching me?
[255:39.38]The red guy was just watching me with binoculars on his head.
[255:41.32]He had the Sam Fisher splinter cell thing on his head.
[255:44.40]He could see what I was doing.
[255:49.71]You won the lottery of passwords.
[255:51.29]You were supposed to get that password through a minigame.
[255:53.63]I don't believe that.
[255:56.18]If that's true, then that's a one in a million chance.
[256:04.01]I want to play Stupid Password.
[256:07.17]Something weird happened.
[256:09.13]I think I just saw myself in the game.
[256:10.71]It didn't look like my room, but somehow I knew it was like in a dream.
[256:15.39]What the fuck?
[256:16.97]I got in, but you don't want the password.
[256:18.73]The game is broken.
[256:19.43]It's been broken from the beginning.
[256:21.80]Come on, I was the one who told you about it.
[256:23.74]You owe me one.
[256:26.04]I didn't write that.
[256:27.78]Sounds like you're playing too much.
[256:31.13]For real?
[256:31.61]Why are you acting like this?
[256:34.29]I don't think either of those should be playing this thing.
[256:41.88]I think I'm done with you.
[256:42.78]That quickly?
[256:45.40]That guy really kind of went from 0 to 100 there.
[256:53.96]I'm a support hot.
[256:55.66]Support hot.
[256:58.00]Super hot dev, no.
[256:59.88]What a conspiracy.
[257:00.83]Let's unravel it.
[257:02.97]Huh?
[257:12.29]I'm really... There's a piano.
[257:13.52]I have to do the tutorial again?
[257:20.86]Please stop doing that.
[257:23.48]Wait for the sick... Please.
[257:25.92]I feel like I'm actually getting shocked in real life when it does that.
[257:28.27]It hurts.
[257:29.27]Keep... Stop.
[257:33.95]Okay, stop.
[257:34.91]Stop doing that.
[257:38.45]Cut it out.
[257:39.05]Oh my god.
[257:45.90]I'm just gonna listen to it.
[257:47.56]Don't move.
[257:48.26]No, fuck you.
[257:51.72]Fine.
[257:52.16]I'll listen to it.
[257:52.80]I have to listen to it.
[257:54.58]Five, four, three, two, one.
[258:00.82]Good dog.
[258:02.93]Super hot.
[258:05.63]Super hot.
[258:07.65]Super hot.
[258:08.73]This is getting real existential at the moment.
[258:10.57]Super hot.
[258:11.67]Super hot.
[258:16.60]You are not in control.
[258:18.68]Yes, I am.
[258:19.24]Look.
[258:19.70]W-A-S-T-W-C.
[258:20.54]Click, click, click.
[258:25.21]Walk him, make him, what did that just say?
[258:27.05]I'm going with him.
[258:37.63]See, you can't control me.
[258:39.36]I unplugged.
[258:40.04]Okay, well, that was easy.
[258:51.52]Now what?
[258:55.24]I already jumped off and it told me not to do that.
[258:56.78]Do I have to jump the... Okay, we're going this way.
[259:09.98]Strong medicine.
[259:16.35]Going for the pelvis shot.
[259:17.59]Works every time.
[259:33.55]Shit.
[259:36.20]That is unfortunate that that didn't... You know what?
[259:50.14]No, I'm not gonna... Lost my shotgun.
[260:04.51]Did I kill the guy behind him?
[260:05.37]Oh, I did.
[260:21.10]Got him.
[260:21.52]And his little friend.
[260:25.90]Somebody spawns behind me now.
[260:27.74]I'm staying here.
[260:28.28]There's a guy that spawns like right here.
[260:34.90]There's so many people over here now.
[260:40.22]Get it.
[260:40.40]Pick it up again and do it.
[260:45.40]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[260:54.12]A bullet just shot over here.
[260:56.73]Let's go.
[261:00.59]Don't.
[261:08.73]I got shot through a wall.
[261:12.37]That came through the corner of the wall.
[261:14.91]Corner of the wall.
[261:17.62]You talking about glitches?
[261:18.74]I got a glitch for you.
[261:19.78]What just happened right there.
[261:23.52]What is that noise?
[261:26.38]When I shoot the shotgun, it makes this really weird bumping noise.
[261:31.72]I don't know why.
[261:32.60]Is that part of the story?
[261:47.13]Alright, give me... Here come... I really just gotta get this guy's gun out of his hands.
[261:55.99]Shit.
[261:56.71]Coffee cup.
[261:57.25]Perfect.
[262:05.10]You've gotta be shitting me.
[262:14.22]Shitting me.
[262:15.80]Shitting me.
[262:20.37]See?
[262:20.45]What I'm talking about?
[262:21.21]It makes like a bumping noise.
[262:22.45]It's weird.
[262:26.87]See?
[262:27.05]And then with bullets.
[262:36.98]Son of a... I'm dead here.
[262:41.74]The only thing I can do is just hope this idiot doesn't shoot me right in the head when he comes around the corner right here.
[262:46.57]He did.
[262:56.23]Weird shotgun noise.
[262:59.50]It's like somebody's knocking on a door.
[263:04.36]Hello, is anybody in there?
[263:05.55]I have a shotgun.
[263:39.73]What the heck?
[263:44.79]Now I'm getting angry.
[263:47.29]I'm getting irritated.
[263:49.64]This guy's firing.
[264:08.49]He shot it.
[264:10.58]Okay, well, I think I'm safe here.
[264:11.64]Somebody was behind me last time.
[264:18.35]A guy comes out of this door.
[264:22.71]Oh my god, you serious?
[264:23.65]Do not even tell me.
[264:24.35]He didn't even have a chance to spawn.
[264:28.53]Give me his gun.
[264:34.05]I thought he was gonna keep going.
[264:44.23]How many more are there?
[264:45.05]Did I hit him?
[264:47.69]I got him.
[264:48.81]Fuck!
[264:54.06]No!
[264:55.84]No!
[264:58.22]No!
[264:59.03]That was so close.
[265:25.29]Boink.
[265:25.59]Go for the shore thing first.
[265:41.74]I have another shot here.
[265:43.18]I want the guy over this way.
[265:44.56]There he is.
[265:46.68]Got him.
[265:51.45]Didn't get him.
[265:52.53]I got the guy behind him.
[265:53.19]Fuck.
[265:59.42]Oh no!
[266:11.29]I really wish that noise wouldn't happen.
[266:12.97]It's really confusing.
[266:15.35]I don't care.
[266:15.71]Get rid of it.
[266:16.35]I'd rather shoot with this gun anyways.
[266:17.27]Crazy Carl 11.
[266:18.79]Crazy Carl.
[266:27.13]Thanks for subbing.
[266:28.45]Welcome to this extremely mind-meltingly frustrating fun game.
[266:36.76]This is very fun.
[266:46.10]You know what?
[266:46.51]Wow.
[266:58.44]Back it up.
[266:59.28]Shoot.
[267:00.07]I have to hit this shot.
[267:03.19]I got it.
[267:07.61]I had to hit that one, too, and I didn't get it.
[267:12.65]Just this guy?
[267:18.18]I see.
[267:18.54]Okay, I haven't gotten this far.
[267:21.16]I don't know if there's a guy to my left.
[267:22.28]I don't know if there's a guy to my right.
[267:23.36]All I know is there's two guys in front of me.
[267:35.43]Anybody else behind him?
[267:38.71]I don't know.
[267:39.29]I just don't know.
[267:39.86]I want to watch this.
[267:48.87]Let's just watch it.
[268:03.29]It is crazy just seeing how this plays out.
[268:05.32]If this was an actual game, this would be happening.
[268:10.36]The fact that it makes it so you have to think about every single second, every single frame of action is really, really cool.
[268:22.66]I'm impressed.
[268:24.48]Super.
[268:30.37]This game is very impressive.
[268:32.51]At least for what it is.
[268:33.55]Inside job.
[268:38.15]Let's just survey it for a second.
[268:39.43]Lead pipe.
[268:40.11]Easy.
[268:41.03]Smash this guy's head.
[268:41.87]That guy's going for a lead pipe.
[268:43.85]Smash.
[268:44.77]Grab his lead pipe.
[268:48.62]Break the bullet.
[268:50.28]Fade it out.
[268:51.70]Get shot right in the face.
[269:02.91]I thought that was going to hit him.
[269:04.37]That will.
[269:20.46]What the hell is this?
[269:29.51]That should have hit him, and everybody knows that.
[269:41.43]Right there.
[269:43.03]Oh, come on.
[269:51.37]That's a machine gun.
[269:57.94]You... Wow!
[270:08.17]I shot the bullet out of the air.
[270:12.46]Another guy coming around the right.
[270:15.78]I thought I killed that guy!
[270:16.98]I definitely killed that guy.
[270:20.48]I hit him right in the stomach.
[270:36.98]I saved ammo for this weapon.
[270:40.19]Just pick it up.
[270:41.84]They spawn over here.
[270:42.94]There you go.
[270:44.02]Hello.
[270:49.49]I'm miscalculation.
[270:51.21]Miscalculation.
[270:53.67]The guy's spawning right here.
[270:55.95]Apparently I hit the fucking matchbox that was on top of that.
[270:58.47]I went through the sardine can that was right there.
[271:01.93]So, wonderful.
[271:04.03]And it broke.
[271:04.45]It broke on the wall.
[271:05.49]The invisible wall, by the way.
[271:06.53]It went right into the invisible wall.
[271:08.13]So that's good.
[271:09.23]Follow the yellow brick road, guys.
[271:10.51]We're just going for it.
[271:11.99]Dead.
[271:28.22]You know what?
[271:28.54]Speedruns are going to be really cool in this game.
[271:30.16]And this guy's gun doesn't exist there.
[271:33.91]Forgot about that guy.
[271:40.15]Actually... This... I forget where's the guy that I spawned.
[271:47.86]He picked it up out of the air.
[271:52.66]None of those bullets hit him.
[271:58.97]they just like went right through his body there's no fucking way man no way no chance that guy's just sitting there smoking a cigarette no we're just going
[272:38.01]I'm so angry.
[272:38.71]I'm so annoyed.
[272:39.99]So he knows I'm around that corner.
[272:48.18]I'm going to go the other way then.
[272:48.96]Because that guy is a real pain in the ass.
[272:52.06]He's right over there.
[272:53.58]Watch this.
[272:56.62]He knew I was coming.
[272:57.96]How would you know that?
[272:59.28]You guys aren't even in communication.
[273:00.41]Where's the other one?
[273:08.54]Give me your gun.
[273:09.58]What?
[273:10.06]Stop.
[273:16.30]Think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it.
[273:27.59]Fuck, what am I doing?
[273:43.44]Now I'm just not even doing it right.
[273:45.52]I'm having trouble now.
[273:47.76]It's gonna break!
[273:56.77]What if I stay back here?
[273:57.65]Yep.
[274:03.41]He's gonna come right out.
[274:04.15]Do I have another shot?
[274:07.71]Didn't hit him.
[274:10.09]Shit.
[274:14.11]Is it in me?
[274:14.95]Is it inside me?
[274:20.26]Who is here?
[274:32.46]I'll give you a grown up.
[274:36.55]I'll give you a grown-up.
[274:54.74]It just always hits the edge.
[274:56.14]I'll just stay right here.
[275:13.19]Doesn't a guy spawn in this room?
[275:14.99]Aye!
[275:39.55]I thought that guy was... I don't even, like, understand.
[275:42.51]Like, I honestly thought I got that guy.
[275:47.71]If I do that again, I am going to seriously fucking... I don't even know.
[275:54.38]I'm going to jump through my window.
[275:56.90]I'm just gonna run and do a stuntman crash through my window if I do that again.
[276:03.86]And I'm gonna do like the Goofy from the Disney Network, the... I'm gonna drop like 5,000 feet.
[276:08.18]Into like a ditch.
[276:30.85]Give me that gun.
[276:32.78]Somebody better not be behind me.
[276:48.09]Please don't come behind me.
[277:07.94]That was... That was only hard because of the amount of corners here.
[277:22.27]When will you learn?
[277:23.53]I don't know.
[277:23.83]When will you learn?
[277:26.01]What does that say?
[277:26.57]Good dog?
[277:31.34]They're just going to shoot me in here?
[277:32.94]I don't get any... I don't get anything.
[277:34.68]I can't leave.
[277:35.50]This seems cruel and stupid.
[277:38.90]Die, dog.
[277:39.98]No.
[277:40.60]I can dodge.
[277:45.42]This is one guy with a gun.
[277:46.20]That's it.
[277:49.48]Now there are two people shooting.
[277:54.63]They're all going to start shooting, aren't they?
[277:56.23]How am I going to do this?
[277:59.77]I'm just going to hug the corners, right?
[278:04.14]Those two haven't shot.
[278:04.92]This guy has his gun up.
[278:05.83]I don't know.
[278:13.09]Oh, I was supposed to die.
[278:14.15]Okay.
[278:23.43]It's a dog.
[278:42.30]Oh, that's how you get a triple slice.
[278:49.42]Now they have guns.
[278:54.82]Oh, I got two of them.
[278:56.18]I got them both with that.
[278:57.14]Nice.
[278:58.66]I'd love the gun.
[279:00.18]I would love if you could pick the gun up.
[279:01.28]That would be fantastic for me right now.
[279:08.01]Watch your six.
[279:23.41]Got it.
[279:25.16]Let's watch this.
[279:26.24]Let's take a look.
[279:26.96]Watch this triple katana.
[279:29.64]Pick this thing up and just bam, bam, slam.
[279:32.68]Turn around.
[279:34.10]Got you with the double headshot.
[279:35.28]Watch this.
[279:36.00]Shrink.
[279:41.82]That would have been cool if I got both of them.
[279:44.76]Dude, people are going to actually see some crazy, amazing gameplay when somebody speeds runs this game.
[279:54.06]They really are.
[279:55.98]So if you're watching this and you're a speedrunner, you definitely should start playing it.
[280:01.91]And then I want to watch you.
[280:05.77]Did you just die here?
[280:09.93]Okay.
[280:11.11]Okay.
[280:12.85]You obviously have to punch that guy immediately.
[280:14.55]Nope.
[280:18.90]Die over here?
[280:19.82]Make him shoot this guy?
[280:21.46]We will shoot him.
[280:29.48]Okay.
[280:32.47]Damn it.
[280:57.30]What happened to that guy?
[281:00.00]What happened to the guy on the right?
[281:01.02]I'm going to watch this because I don't know how that guy died.
[281:11.55]Who shot him?
[281:15.07]Watch this guy.
[281:15.59]Watch this guy.
[281:16.87]Who shot that guy?
[281:17.71]That guy's head exploded.
[281:23.42]Okay, I'll take it.
[281:24.20]I will take the victory, absolutely.
[281:25.60]But I did not shoot this guy.
[281:27.34]He just died.
[281:28.12]Oh.
[281:31.94]Okie dokie.
[281:34.32]One more time.
[281:39.36]Did the ricochet bounce off?
[281:40.28]I don't understand.
[281:40.80]They're really hammering this no plot thing.
[281:50.38]The guy's outside the elevator.
[281:51.22]Was the elevator open?
[281:56.89]Back in the jail cell.
[282:02.18]Left click to receive.
[282:03.32]I'm watching.
[282:16.94]Your home.
[282:22.43]This is easier.
[282:26.21]We're watching.
[282:27.59]We're watching you.
[282:33.25]They're watching me.
[282:34.97]This is only your body.
[282:38.86]Your mind is here.
[282:39.68]Is this supposed to be a thing?
[282:43.54]Like the guy sitting on that chair is me doing like Vive, like HTC Vive VR.
[282:49.56]Somebody hacked into my brain.
[282:50.79]So I'm just sitting there with the VR helmet on.
[282:55.26]And a hacker got a hold of my brain.
[282:57.72]Because they went into my VR helmet.
[283:04.84]What if we don't let you disconnect?
[283:10.19]That's a scary thought.
[283:14.03]We're watching you change every morning.
[283:19.17]We're sitting there watching you.
[283:21.37]That's a real nice tie you got on.
[283:23.53]We'd like to see it come off.
[283:29.99]If you die in the game, you die in real life.
[283:34.30]So, was this not my friend the whole time?
[283:36.94]This was some guy?
[283:39.42]Some mean person?
[283:41.80]Quit while you can.
[283:44.40]Okay, I get it.
[283:52.33]I didn't know.
[283:53.41]I'm sorry?
[284:00.03]Clearly you are not.
[284:02.13]You are ruled by your pride.
[284:05.36]Promise you won't launch superhot.exe again.
[284:08.78]I won't.
[284:12.16]Yes.
[284:13.96]Say the exact words.
[284:17.80]I won't launch superhot.exe again.
[284:21.89]Good.
[284:23.55]Chat is ended.
[284:24.37]Go, go, open it.
[284:39.45]Get down.
[284:42.55]Huh?
[284:55.08]Higher up.
[284:56.02]Okay.
[285:02.17]Give me the Crystal Skulls.
[285:05.17]Dan Aykroyd, Crystal Skull Vodka was so proud of me.
[285:11.82]Can I just... No, it's easier this way.
[285:14.76]What the fuck is happening?
[285:34.39]I did this the first try last time.
[285:35.85]What is happening with this?
[285:53.08]Give me the gun!
[286:03.03]That's- What the fuck?
[286:06.21]That's not good.
[286:14.40]This guy's got a katana.
[286:15.34]I don't- Okay, I only have to worry- I got it.
[286:17.92]I only have to worry about that guy right in front.
[286:24.78]They won't know where I am.
[286:27.62]See?
[286:28.18]That was a stealth kill.
[286:29.18]They have no idea where I am.
[286:31.32]They're gonna come looking for me and they're not gonna see me.
[286:35.07]Here they come.
[286:36.61]See?
[286:36.75]He still doesn't know.
[286:38.39]Surprise!
[286:57.90]Okay.
[286:59.54]Probably should have grabbed one of those guns.
[287:00.84]Because there are two guys with swords following me right now.
[287:03.52]But here's a gun right here.
[287:04.37]Oh, come on.
[287:37.25]The last guy is the guy with the machine gun.
[287:41.55]He's just still there.
[287:45.00]Ooh.
[287:46.46]Somebody peeked a little too much.
[287:50.18]Super.
[287:51.74]Hot.
[287:52.86]Super.
[287:53.78]Hot.
[287:54.88]Super.
[287:57.60]Thankfully, me throwing that crystal skull actually saved my life.
[288:03.78]I would have died absolutely right there.
[288:10.51]Got him.
[288:11.37]Alright, cool.
[288:12.39]Super Hulk.
[288:20.50]Telephone call.
[288:21.70]Hello.
[288:22.06]Oh, don't.
[288:23.02]Come on, stop calling me.
[288:27.90]Alright, didn't I tell you I want my break?
[288:41.73]Security door.
[288:54.26]Stop knocking on my door.
[288:59.88]Shit.
[289:02.76]Shit.
[289:23.34]Just a little bit further.
[289:25.08]Just a little bit further.
[289:30.67]Shotgun.
[289:33.17]Shit.
[289:42.78]Shit.
[289:43.66]Shit.
[289:45.88]Shit.
[290:02.04]Watch him!
[290:12.77]Got him.
[290:15.83]Who goes to a meeting with guns?
[290:17.15]Yeah, I know, really.
[290:17.91]Today we're going to talk about our real estate infrastructure.
[290:23.19]I hope everybody brought their guns.
[290:27.57]Well, you know what?
[290:28.11]It's a good thing they did, because I came in and did that.
[290:31.10]Too bad I was way better than them.
[290:39.68]Really, it was that right there.
[290:42.58]Turning that corner of the phone in the beginning.
[290:45.78]Here we go.
[290:52.65]He's going to chat me up again.
[290:58.15]I can't wait to wake up from a dream.
[290:59.79]Is it going to be a dream?
[291:04.40]No, I didn't keep my words right.
[291:06.04]Pay yourself a visit.
[291:07.42]I'm gonna be able to walk behind me as me?
[291:09.49]Ugh, fine.
[291:14.59]These cords are all gonna be plugged into my head.
[291:17.87]Right?
[291:21.61]You know the way.
[291:22.19]Look at this TV screen.
[291:25.45]I'm watching me watch myself watching me play the game.
[291:28.15]You guys are watching me watch myself play the game watching me.
[291:32.60]And this is on Twitch.
[291:34.48]This is even weirder, you know?
[291:38.45]I told you.
[291:39.35]I told you.
[291:43.87]What's over there?
[291:48.31]There's me.
[291:49.71]Oh my god, they weren't lying.
[291:51.01]I have to unplug myself.
[291:58.85]Get off the video game.
[292:00.31]Do your homework.
[292:19.14]How is your head?
[292:21.92]It hurts.
[292:26.68]It should.
[292:28.60]You are treating the system like a toy.
[292:30.96]It is not a toy.
[292:33.86]See, I am the mother.
[292:35.75]It's not a toy.
[292:36.49]It's a tool.
[292:37.07]I can't control myself.
[292:39.77]I just want to play VR games.
[292:41.01]I'm not even typing these words.
[292:43.91]I just want to shoot red guys.
[292:53.28]It does kind of look like your room.
[292:57.89]You have suffered a head trauma.
[293:00.47]Seek medical attention.
[293:05.13]This is where your story ends.
[293:11.83]Okay.
[293:13.45]Where's the doctor?
[293:16.34]Is there a doctor app?
[293:19.56]What?
[293:24.91]Okay, I can't do anything?
[293:27.55]Oh, what the heck?
[293:28.19]I want to play more things.
[293:29.15]Can I even change my settings?
[293:30.87]Wow, what if it was too loud?
[293:33.03]What if my video card just crashed right now?
[293:35.24]Can't even change the settings.
[293:39.86]No, no, no, no, no.
[293:40.46]I didn't think it was going to do that.
[293:41.54]I thought it was going to be a funny joke.
[293:49.13]It really did just quit the game.
[293:51.79]I thought it was just going to be a funny joke.
[293:58.55]I have to open the game again.
[294:04.71]Hopefully I didn't delete everything.
[294:05.85]There's an update for the game.
[294:11.43]I can't even open it.
[294:14.08]I can't even play the game.
[294:15.26]There's an update queue and it won't install it.
[294:19.88]Joke's on me.
[294:21.00]I can't play the game.
[294:28.92]Oh, here we go.
[294:29.36]Okay.
[294:31.26]Let's go.
[294:31.66]There was a patch.
[294:32.80]I don't know what it was.
[294:34.52]Maybe it takes away the door knock shotgun noise.
[294:38.65]That would be cool, wouldn't it?
[294:46.95]What's going on?
[294:51.99]Initializing.
[294:52.63]Pussy shit 2.0 failed.
[294:54.35]What?
[294:58.13]oh no somebody didn't blow into the nintendo entertainment system console game take it out blow in it put it back in and if it doesn't work then put another game inside the nes stuff it on top of the other one and then turn it on and see if it works super hot super hot super hot super hot super hot
[295:25.97]I have no control of myself.
[295:27.59]I need to play Superhot, Superhot, Superhot.
[295:32.37]Sounds like you're playing too much.
[295:34.92]I just gotta get back in the game.
[295:36.80]I have to play Superhot again.
[295:39.42]Cute, you don't share password.
[295:41.40]Now this, I'm so blocking you.
[295:44.62]Just wanna get back in the game.

[296:00.72]Yeah.
[296:02.40]Get me in there.
[296:05.34]I'll show you how a real gamer plays with his VR helmet on.
[296:18.30]Oh.
[296:21.68]Okay.
[296:26.07]I don't much like this.
[296:29.63]This actually hurts my brain a lot.
[296:40.70]Well, it looks like I'm on the Super Mario 64 Bowser stairs.
[296:43.34]Oh no, here I am.
[296:46.20]The game just closed.
[296:48.32]No, it didn't.
[296:48.72]What?
[296:50.33]The system will set you free.
[296:54.75]This system will shape you.
[296:55.95]I just want to shoot more red guys.
[296:59.26]What are you doing?
[297:08.04]You just gave me that fake computer virus that eats your desktop with big spiders and bugs and stuff.
[297:29.67]The soup is too hot.
[297:30.57]The soup is too hot.
[297:34.93]The clam chowder is too hot.
[297:36.59]Let's go!
[297:38.51]What?
[297:40.18]Press E to hot switch into enemies?
[297:48.46]That's me, isn't it?
[297:51.30]This is for a computer attack, eh?
[298:00.52]Okay, new game mechanic.
[298:07.22]Get fucking monitored!
[298:17.08]Ooh, right in his head!
[298:32.38]Keyboard goes to this guy.
[298:33.90]Monitor goes to this guy.
[298:36.40]It barely doesn't even fit through.
[298:37.68]It's going to be hard to do that.
[298:39.42]I'll just take the bat.
[298:41.74]Hot switch ready?
[298:43.91]Room service?
[298:47.31]Hot switch into the guy with the gun.
[298:54.47]Wow.
[299:09.09]So how long's the cooldown for that?
[299:10.37]It must be only when you're allowed to, when it wants you to.
[299:17.97]Okay, so I guess I can obviously go into this guy.
[299:32.70]Wow.
[299:34.74]Stuck under his hand.
[299:35.56]That guy just got wrecked.
[299:40.35]Is that guy holding a shovel?
[299:43.87]You really think you're gonna kill me with a shovel?
[299:46.39]What a dumbass.
[299:49.43]Like, what a stupid butthead.
[299:52.48]Right, guys?
[299:53.00]Did he drop his gun?
[300:16.28]Oh, they didn't fix the shotgun noise.
[300:23.30]I'll just be you.
[300:27.01]Uh-oh, shovel guy.
[300:33.11]Huh?
[300:50.49]The lights just broke.
[300:55.69]Okay, I'm gonna calm down here.
[300:57.19]I got the gun again.
[301:04.23]Oh, I shot myself?
[301:12.19]Did I?
[301:12.43]Is that even possible?
[301:22.07]Okay, there's a guy.
[301:22.81]This guy has a gun.
[301:26.03]This guy has a gun.
[301:26.91]There's another guy right here.
[301:34.89]There he is.
[301:35.49]I'll switch to him.
[301:36.11]Anything around me?
[301:39.31]Can't pick up a cinder block.
[301:40.79]Guy's shooting right now.
[301:44.31]Okay, okay.
[301:44.71]Can I kill the guy?
[301:45.47]Shove the guy.
[301:46.23]Shove the guy.
[301:49.81]I'm going to throw the shovel at him.
[301:50.87]Go over there.
[301:51.35]Pick up the hammer.
[301:53.55]Nobody else coming?
[301:55.11]Just shovel guy?
[301:58.09]Crush that guy's fucking skull.
[302:02.99]And then... Whoops-a-daisy!
[302:07.50]Serious.
[302:09.50]You gotta be kidding me.
[302:10.28]That was so dumb.
[302:12.18]That's what I gotta do, though.
[302:28.20]Hate when that happens.
[302:33.53]No, just restart it again.
[302:34.83]I'm getting so wrecked.
[302:40.51]The gun just shatters every time.
[302:47.87]Somebody... Who's... There he is.
[302:58.87]Shovel guy again.
[302:59.59]That's me.
[303:02.57]Wait, is that me?
[303:04.51]That's not me.
[303:04.95]Yes, it is.
[303:07.71]Okay, now don't get shot by this guy in the face.
[303:09.69]Okay, hit him.
[303:17.46]Where's the bullet?
[303:19.88]Oh!
[303:21.78]Where?
[303:22.16]Where is it?
[303:22.54]Where?
[303:27.81]Should I switch to that guy?
[303:28.55]I don't know where the other guy is.
[303:33.94]Guy down there.
[303:34.82]Two guys down there.
[303:35.60]Watch this.
[303:36.14]Switch.
[303:40.72]Pick up the gun.
[303:41.83]Don't punch him like three times.
[303:49.81]There's one more guy.
[303:51.43]There he is.
[303:54.36]Got him.
[304:02.90]Went into that guy.
[304:03.76]Got the shovel dude.
[304:05.50]Boink.
[304:08.70]That was pretty lucky.
[304:10.16]He could have shot me from down there.
[304:12.55]In between those two pillars.
[304:16.51]That's it.
[304:17.15]Let's do it.
[304:18.61]Huh?
[304:23.77]Huh?
[304:26.46]What was that?
[304:32.08]Touch day.
[304:34.11]Got a briefcase.
[304:36.87]Ooh, he's gonna kill that.
[304:50.64]That's cool.
[304:51.68]Cool.
[304:54.42]You're fired.
[304:55.38]I think I appeared right next to me.
[305:03.52]Shit.
[305:09.24]Who's behind me?
[305:10.64]This guy.
[305:15.88]I don't need to switch.
[305:16.85]That's a waste.
[305:18.45]Kill this guy, switch to this dude.
[305:22.31]Okay.
[305:25.31]Oh, that's not good.
[305:28.45]This guy's unarmed.
[305:35.77]Yikes.
[305:38.10]Okay, I can switch again.
[305:38.84]I should switch to this guy.
[305:47.99]Yeah, switch!
[305:51.59]Oh dear, that was not what I should have done.
[305:53.17]That was a bad idea.
[305:54.17]I should not have switched to that guy.
[305:55.35]Run!
[305:57.97]I'm inside somebody.
[306:02.66]You gotta be kidding me.
[306:03.62]That was crazy.
[306:05.82]That was crazy.
[306:09.03]I think I'm still in trouble.
[306:09.89]Is there a computer on this desk?
[306:11.33]There's a telephone.
[306:14.84]Fucking E.T.
[306:15.58]phone.
[306:17.86]I got him right in the face.
[306:19.20]Give me a gun.
[306:20.52]This guy's gonna shotgun point it right at me.
[306:26.34]I don't know what to do.
[306:30.77]Briefcase.
[306:37.86]What the f- Oh.
[307:07.73]I wanted to watch that replay too.
[307:09.09]Fuck.
[307:12.31]Fuck you guys.
[307:13.11]I don't even give a crap anymore.
[307:16.39]You think I need to change to you?
[307:17.37]I'll just fucking beat your face and shoot him.
[307:20.25]Shoot him.
[307:21.24]Shoot this idiot.
[307:28.92]Hey, honey, I'm going to work today.
[307:32.68]I'm just kidding.
[307:44.70]Oh, what a tough day at a job.
[307:46.20]Just kidding, honey.
[307:48.06]Who else?
[308:05.78]There's a guy behind here, right?
[308:11.40]Somebody hang that phone up.
[308:27.01]Punch that guy, twitch this guy's body.
[308:29.68]Oh no.
[308:31.12]Oh no!
[308:32.30]Oh no!
[308:34.72]Stop firing at Will!
[308:45.33]I wanted the gun!
[308:56.34]This whole stream has been just me making loud butt clench noises the whole time.
[309:06.30]Let's get a look at this one.
[309:09.26]From the beginning.
[309:09.78]I want to see this one from the beginning.
[309:13.54]Double briefcase.
[309:15.20]Switcheroo punch elbow.
[309:16.68]Shotgun.
[309:19.68]That was pretty nice.
[309:20.30]I'm not going to lie.
[309:24.56]What was the point of that?
[309:25.40]I didn't need to do that.
[309:27.60]I just freaked out and just throwing briefcases and phones at the people?
[309:31.76]That was so unnecessary.
[309:39.03]I'll give you a 9 on the pucker scale.
[309:40.65]I think that was supposed to be my brain.
[309:52.73]Use you to destroy the enemy from within.
[309:56.77]Somebody called this.
[309:58.05]Didn't somebody say I was controlling a robotic person in a real world?
[310:07.26]Everybody get that?
[310:10.18]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[310:13.50]I thought that was in the game.
[310:15.80]Drell Talks.
[310:16.64]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[310:19.24]That sounded like it was going to be in the game.
[310:37.88]Give me this propane tank.
[310:39.11]Give me the gun.
[310:42.47]Fuck you all.
[310:43.67]Who's next?
[310:45.75]I don't care.
[310:47.35]Come on.
[310:51.67]Okay, I'm starting to lose it here.
[310:57.36]I'm actually starting to lose my mind.
[310:59.36]Switch to this guy.
[311:01.34]Hold on.
[311:01.92]Slow down.
[311:02.32]I need to slow down for a second.
[311:04.34]I actually am going to lose my mind.
[311:13.46]Let's go.
[311:25.47]Can they shoot through the glass?
[311:38.71]Guy right next to me.
[311:40.93]I just need to have him switch.
[311:46.92]God!
[311:49.14]It's so painful to know.
[311:51.62]I'm just gonna keep hero switching.
[311:54.76]This isn't Overwatch, this is a different game.
[311:56.72]Let me change to Winston.
[312:04.91]Last call!
[312:16.75]You got the gun again.
[312:30.60]What's going on?
[312:39.74]I don't know.
[312:40.14]Did I switch into the guy that got shot in the head?
[312:46.72]Okay, switch into this guy.
[312:50.66]Grab the gun.
[313:02.07]Ugh!
[313:05.06]Fine, take over his body.
[313:06.66]I got care.
[313:08.88]I need this gun right now.
[313:15.89]I don't know whose bullets are whose.
[313:20.11]I don't know.
[313:21.71]Somebody behind me.
[313:22.89]No.
[313:24.45]Hero Switch.
[313:25.91]Stop calling it Hero Switch, for God's sake.
[313:28.17]I win.
[313:35.26]I just shot myself, yeah.
[313:41.20]I'm not gonna lie, the hero change thing... I called it Hero Switch again.
[313:45.94]Taking over somebody else's brain feels like it's kind of cheating.
[313:48.52]Super.
[313:56.14]Repeat after me.
[313:58.14]Mind is software.
[314:02.33]Mind is software.
[314:05.17]I'm on a moving train.
[314:23.04]Oh no!
[314:29.84]Nope.
[314:30.92]I gotta drop down here.
[314:33.88]Should've got the shotgun.
[314:41.17]I'm trying to take over that guy's body.
[314:46.05]Drop down.
[314:48.07]Shotgun!
[314:52.58]Shotgun!
[314:56.16]Shit!
[314:59.86]I missed it!
[315:06.26]It's gonna be all about the briefcase here.
[315:11.15]It's all about the briefcase.
[315:32.24]Get this double I had I definitely got a double that spread was huge.
[315:36.74]Yep.
[315:37.76]Perfect Perfect What If I had a face came on you guys would have just seen the funniest face ever It was like I just like smelled a fart that's like what the face was
[315:58.99]Somebody just spotted it in my face.
[316:16.73]I'm trying to shoot!
[316:17.59]I'm trying to shoot!
[316:28.33]Every time, I just go buy it.
[316:31.47]Because I'm a dummy.
[316:49.38]How did one of those not hit me?
[316:55.69]There's no ammo in the gun.
[316:57.93]Through a wall again.
[317:00.01]We get to have that creep back up on us.
[317:03.78]Five of those pellets went through a damn wall.
[317:09.00]Wait a second.
[317:11.58]I can choose a body.
[317:14.88]Yeah, I can.
[317:15.26]Let's go.
[317:16.70]Okay, that was easy.
[317:22.13]Come on, just like in Overwatch.
[317:23.25]You got a hero switch.
[317:28.58]Okay, I got both of them.
[317:29.36]That means I can teleport.
[317:30.63]Do the teleportation device.
[317:32.77]Pick up the shotgun.
[317:33.91]Machine gun.
[317:34.23]This is going to hit me right in the nuts.
[317:37.71]I shot the ground.
[317:45.65]I shot the ground.
[317:46.37]I shot the ground.
[317:54.69]This is so easy and I'm just messing it up over and over again.
[317:58.05]Take your time.
[318:14.60]I got nowhere to hide though.
[318:16.28]I kinda do.
[318:21.91]Shit.
[318:31.93]Hero switch.
[318:32.41]That guy.
[318:37.51]That guy.
[318:39.07]Oh, he's dead.
[318:39.49]Is that the guy shooting right now?
[318:48.72]I need this gun.
[318:49.38]He shot the other guy's head off.
[319:01.93]Yeah!
[319:12.92]That would've been funny if I teleported into him, actually.
[319:17.96]Let's go!
[319:24.64]This guy again.
[319:27.24]Bodies are disposable.
[319:28.76]This is a sequel to Pepsi Man.
[319:35.85]Bodies are disposable.
[319:37.15]Sure, whatever you gotta say.
[319:41.97]Alright, you want my impressions of the game?
[319:43.79]Like, first impressions?
[319:46.46]This is awesome.
[319:49.26]This is so cool.
[319:53.02]I don't know how long this game is, but this is pretty damn awesome.
[319:56.92]This is really interesting.
[319:59.72]Take out all the story stuff, because I kind of just don't care at all.
[320:04.42]But this whole thing, this kind of puzzle game, FPS, where you have to plan, overly plan, and know, it's, this is absolutely, this is awesome.
[320:17.03]So, just know that this is fucking cool as all hell.
[320:19.91]And I'm gonna drop on this guy, watch this.
[320:25.52]He's not even aiming in the right spot.
[320:26.82]What a, what a noob.
[320:29.38]Told ya.
[320:33.50]I don't think I'm... I can't get out of this one.
[320:36.38]Nope.
[320:55.59]Oh, jeez.
[320:58.64]Will this guy run?
[320:59.72]Please... The gate is closing!
[321:12.03]Who's this guy shooting at?
[321:12.80]I thought the guy was shooting... I thought the guy was facing the other direction.
[321:16.92]Run that back.
[321:19.36]Am I crazy or was that guy facing the other direction?
[321:23.34]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[321:26.43]Bionic Jesus.
[321:28.01]Welcome, dude.
[321:28.43]Thanks.
[321:30.05]Welcome to the time stoppers.
[321:50.64]Am I crazy?
[321:51.32]I don't think I am.
[321:52.02]I really thought that guy was facing the other direction.
[321:53.86]Okay, let him kill his friend.
[321:56.68]This guy comes around the corner.
[321:58.34]Doesn't get a chance to shoot.
[321:59.60]I just absolutely ruined that guy's entire day and his weekend.
[322:03.27]You're gonna have a bad weekend.
[322:10.01]Can I shoot through this?
[322:16.23]No one's gonna spawn behind me, right?
[322:28.39]Look at all these tools.
[322:40.00]I'm just fucking this guy up so bad.
[322:47.72]What, are you serious?
[322:51.56]What the fuck?
[322:59.46]That was so stupid.
[323:04.20]That guy got a hammer, a bat, and I shot him.
[323:10.05]And he still picked up a weapon to try to kill me.
[323:17.01]This guy will kill his buddy.
[323:17.99]He's gonna kill me too.
[323:21.43]He's like slinked down and tried to grab it behind his back.
[323:24.92]He's trying to hide it from me.
[323:29.27]shoot you shoot him shoot him champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence chief mort chief morty I'm kind of scared to move because I don't know where the bullets are going they're shooting somebody there's another guy here his head's gone
[324:00.50]Okay.
[324:02.14]Okay.
[324:10.65]That probably got them both, right?
[324:13.19]No.
[324:16.73]No one's coming behind me, right?
[324:18.61]Good.
[324:26.37]Aye, aye, aye.
[324:29.18]Aye, aye, aye.
[324:37.62]Okay.
[324:40.72]None of those bullets hit that guy.
[324:42.05]That doesn't make any logical sense.
[324:47.95]I was going to say, what on earth?
[324:53.31]Got it.
[324:57.78]How did I get the game?
[324:58.68]It's on Steam.
[325:00.32]It just released like a couple hours ago.
[325:13.24]Super.
[325:16.87]When you switch bodies, the old one dies automatically?
[325:20.35]It does, but I think it's... You know?
[325:26.91]System will set me free.
[325:33.75]One more step.
[325:39.86]Alright.
[325:49.92]Jeez.
[325:50.20]Got him in the leg.
[325:55.08]Wow!
[325:55.96]I gotta take this extremely slowly.
[326:01.14]That's gonna hit him right in the leg.
[326:03.79]Nope, it's going to miss.
[326:06.33]That's also going to hit a bullet.
[326:09.75]I'm gonna be precise.
[326:12.40]Hey.
[326:14.08]Hey!
[326:14.94]Um, you don't like to listen.
[326:16.08]What are you talking about?
[326:16.90]You don't fucking like to listen.
[326:18.72]What the hell?
[326:19.12]What are you talking about?
[326:20.18]I want to tell you.
[326:20.82]It might take you a couple more hours to figure out.
[326:23.88]You can cut bullets in half with the sword.
[326:28.24]People want to see that.
[326:29.04]What do you mean you can cut bullets in half with the sword?
[326:31.54]When the guy shoots it, you slice it with the sword and cut the bullet.
[326:36.23]Are you like on the wiki page?
[326:39.50]Oh, this game's like pretty much existed for like a year.
[326:44.71]It did?
[326:46.19]Yeah.
[326:51.43]That's not going to work here.
[326:52.39]I was going to let you know.
[326:55.72]Thanks for the tip, but I don't think that's going to work here.
[326:58.18]I need to like tactically kill like everybody.
[327:00.32]No, I'm just sitting here drinking some wine.
[327:03.20]Are you having fun drinking your wine?
[327:07.20]I gotta kill this guy.
[327:08.94]Teleportation device into this guy.
[327:11.45]Got him in the leg.
[327:12.41]Boink.
[327:12.87]Switch.
[327:14.51]Okie dokie.
[327:15.29]Now we got a guy over here.
[327:19.13]He's gonna shoot.
[327:21.97]We got a sword.
[327:23.15]Right there.
[327:23.73]Guy right here with a pistol.
[327:30.58]Who's shooting?
[327:31.46]Huh?
[327:35.08]Don't mind me, I'm just... Gonna go... Get... Just wanna get the... Ah, you... Fuck!
[327:58.52]What if I just... Maybe I should just go on this guy.
[328:00.84]Right?
[328:01.72]And then grab the shotgun that's right there, apparently.
[328:04.97]This guy with a shotgun.
[328:08.14]And that's it.
[328:10.02]This dude gets hit.
[328:11.66]Boom.
[328:12.94]I'm dead, but that's... I got it.
[328:13.82]I got it.
[328:14.10]This is what we're gonna do.
[328:18.24]This guy's gonna get hit with it.
[328:19.48]Teleport into this guy's body.
[328:21.70]Grab the shotgun.
[328:23.96]Over the shoulder.
[328:25.46]Shotgun.
[328:28.82]Didn't hit him.
[328:30.74]Now I have a choice.
[328:33.68]Got that guy.
[328:36.51]Oh, throw that into him.
[328:38.61]Get him with the ashtray too, just in case he gets the gun.
[328:41.71]He's not going to get it.
[328:43.15]Nobody else over here, right?
[328:44.26]Good.
[328:45.20]Boom.
[328:47.04]Take this guy's body because he will shoot me in the face.
[328:51.34]And now there's new people spawning.
[328:53.72]Yep.
[328:57.23]Guy with a katana.
[329:00.05]I can punch this guy, right?
[329:05.85]Nobody else is coming around here, right?
[329:07.40]I can switch.
[329:12.10]I gotta find the heart, I think.
[329:13.92]Good.
[329:14.12]Another katana.
[329:17.18]I'm so paranoid about somebody coming behind me right now.
[329:22.61]Oh lord.
[329:27.71]Who else?
[329:28.39]Come on, there's another person.
[329:32.27]I don't know.
[329:36.45]Yes!
[329:43.78]That worked.
[329:47.96]Got him right through the chest.
[329:50.15]Yeah, check this out.
[329:52.47]Right there.
[329:54.87]Except, I don't think that killed him.
[329:56.33]No, I didn't.
[329:57.47]I did not kill that guy.
[329:58.37]Super...
[330:03.98]We've reached the core.
[330:06.00]Am I at the final level?
[330:11.62]Did I beat the game?
[330:12.38]I think I beat the game.
[330:26.90]I hope I don't have to run down this whole hallway because this is too long.
[330:33.47]Always look behind.
[330:33.98]There's probably a car that's going to come by and hit me.
[330:38.64]Some dude on a motorcycle is going to drive by and just smash me with a katana.
[330:50.15]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[330:55.40]I get it.
[330:55.80]He always gets me.
[330:57.12]Every time.
[331:01.52]Thanks, uh, Linksor24.
[331:05.06]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[331:09.34]Why is that perfect timing every single time it happens?
[331:13.14]That was an intense moment.
[331:15.25]Alright, we'll hot switch the cord.
[331:24.52]Like, we're going down this really scary hallway.
[331:27.00]We got to the end.
[331:28.52]Ah, the red champagne.
[331:31.94]Take the core?
[331:34.48]What if I don't want to?
[331:38.64]Don't bother.
[331:40.24]Well, I am going to bother.
[331:41.09]I don't want to do that.
[331:41.77]What the hell is that?
[331:42.39]I don't want to fucking link my brain with the Triforce of Wisdom.
[331:46.73]Are you kidding me?
[331:48.31]That sounds really stupid.
[331:56.62]Take the core!
[332:00.74]Who else?
[332:01.42]Fuck you!
[332:03.02]And your friend!
[332:05.24]And his friend!
[332:10.72]Holy shit, did I shoot it out of the air?
[332:22.02]I think I did.
[332:27.93]I fucking missed.
[332:30.55]Where's that guy running to?
[332:31.37]Am I gonna have to... Is this just completely futile?
[332:46.09]Do I have to do that?
[332:46.97]Am I gonna get an easter egg?
[332:51.51]This has to be an easter egg, right?
[332:52.97]See, it's like yelling at me.
[332:55.75]I thought I had...
[333:00.12]Easy.
[333:17.47]This really wants me to do this, but I don't want to do it.
[333:25.50]Where is he?
[333:25.92]Somebody shot.
[333:26.92]Somebody shot.
[333:32.30]Pliers.
[333:32.76]My only hope.
[333:34.16]Guy's dead back there.
[333:35.73]I don't know how he died.
[333:45.69]Did I get him?
[333:49.53]I'm going to the guy in the back.
[333:50.37]Right here.
[333:58.17]Oh, shit!
[334:08.96]Shooting again.
[334:14.02]God damn it!
[334:18.41]Maybe I shouldn't be doing that.
[334:19.57]Maybe it is an infinite spawn.
[334:23.97]I'll try shooting the core.
[334:26.93]Just shoot the damn thing.
[334:34.26]I'm not sure what's happening right now, guys.
[334:36.07]I- I'm alive.
[334:37.45]I am alive.
[334:38.11]You shot it out of midair, you prick.
[334:45.07]I don't- I feel like I need this mo- Just, let's go.
[334:47.93]Uploading all my thoughts and memories.
[335:03.38]They dragged you out.
[335:07.96]Nope.
[335:09.08]Okay.
[335:14.88]Get out of the fucking way!
[335:15.99]Get out of my way!
[335:16.95]That guy ruined everything.
[335:23.21]I get it.
[335:23.61]I get it.
[335:23.91]I have to, um...
[335:27.84]I have to just keep... Anytime the hot switch is available, I have to do it.
[335:31.66]So I had the right idea.
[335:32.60]You just have to stay alive and keep hot switching the core.
[335:35.98]Which is what we're going to do.
[335:37.63]Return to the core.
[335:38.17]Let's go.
[335:38.43]You're going to get the bad ending.
[335:47.59]Now it's going to get to 60% or something.
[335:48.85]Do it again.
[335:57.10]That guy just shot that other guy immediately in the face.
[335:59.98]I had nothing to do with it.
[336:00.81]That was an argument.
[336:01.41]That was like a workplace argument these red dudes had.
[336:04.47]Woo!
[336:04.71]Woo!
[336:14.56]Hopefully I still have the same amount of percent.
[336:16.06]Ah, you son of a bitch.
[336:37.53]Okay.
[336:41.93]Ah!
[336:47.52]Losing my patience.
[336:49.88]When you lose your patience, you start to just... I'm unraveling.
[336:53.74]I'm unraveling right now.
[336:54.66]I'm at the end of the game or something.
[336:56.32]Stop unraveling.
[337:01.06]Stop unraveling.
[337:01.66]Stop unraveling.
[337:03.30]Stop unraveling.
[337:11.41]Good.
[337:21.41]There's another guy over there.
[337:27.84]Yes, there is.
[337:29.46]Please shoot him.
[337:37.62]Oh!
[337:39.55]Oh!
[337:41.83]I tried to shoot the bullet out of the air.
[337:45.85]Damn.
[337:50.57]It'd be great if this idiot wasn't in the way.
[337:52.72]That bullet was right in my face.
[338:04.94]I don't care.
[338:09.58]I'm gonna do it in a safer place.
[338:15.29]Tighten this!
[338:15.77]Ooh, I got him!
[338:28.02]Who's next?
[338:35.24]That's the right idea though.
[338:36.16]Go down there.
[339:09.88]Got him.
[339:13.73]Got him.
[339:20.07]That it?
[339:21.69]There's a guy spawning right next to me.
[339:29.43]Oh, hold on.
[339:30.49]Hold on.
[339:30.89]Slow it down.
[339:31.59]Don't move.
[339:36.64]Oh.
[339:44.18]Alright, hold on a second.
[339:44.92]I need to take a second here.
[339:50.00]One more guy.
[339:53.88]This is still spawning.
[339:57.18]Focus on the core.
[339:58.60]Give me the core.
[340:06.89]Was that it?
[340:10.37]No, I have to do it even more.
[340:12.73]I have to do it even more.
[340:16.37]Whoa.
[340:17.39]Give me this gun.
[340:19.17]Does somebody have a katana?
[340:25.42]I heard swinging.
[340:26.92]I hate a gun too.
[340:35.16]Oh, there's a wrench.
[340:42.61]I'm doing things.
[340:45.59]I'm doing things.
[340:52.11]There's no getting out of this.
[340:59.83]What's going on?
[341:02.71]I honestly thought that was a display on my screen.
[341:05.06]Something was going to say something to a guy with a katana.
[341:15.22]Who else is here?
[341:25.38]I'm so scared.
[341:27.27]I'm just so irrationally terrified.
[341:30.01]I'm dead.
[341:45.99]Give me the gun.
[341:46.87]He was trying to get that out of my reach.
[341:48.20]Do you see that?
[341:48.64]That was bullshit.
[342:15.83]Oh god damn!
[342:18.75]This is so crazy!
[342:33.84]I have nothing here.
[342:35.54]All I got is a hammer.
[342:37.10]What am I gonna- I got a wrench.
[342:42.16]Who can I wrench?
[342:43.08]This guy.
[342:46.40]This guy too.
[342:47.64]Shoot him.
[342:48.32]Shoot him!
[342:57.24]Katana and machine gun.
[342:58.62]Katana and machine gun.
[343:00.30]And another guy coming with a gun.
[343:02.41]I gotta kill the guy with the katana.
[343:04.63]Throw it into the next guy's head.
[343:11.91]Spawning behind me?
[343:13.15]Spawning behind me.
[343:14.01]Somebody's spawning behind me.
[343:16.60]I don't know.
[343:17.16]Yes, there is.
[343:21.56]Nobody else?
[343:22.54]Nobody else.
[343:23.22]Gun.
[343:23.86]Gun.
[343:25.00]Shoot.
[343:25.46]Got him.
[343:26.92]Another guy.
[343:32.57]That was a mistake.
[343:34.25]That was a mistake.
[343:37.73]That was a major mistake.
[343:40.05]Think this one through.
[343:43.67]Guy to the left.
[343:44.57]Two guys to the right.
[343:51.73]I'm boned.
[343:53.25]I'm so dead.
[343:55.59]Somehow this guy has not killed me.
[343:59.45]I was behind the fucking wall.
[344:10.18]I just- I forgot.
[344:21.54]Why do I have to be that close?
[344:27.00]Mistake.
[344:28.02]Another mistake.
[344:37.17]Well, you have to throw the guns, because the guns only have, like, two shots in them.
[344:41.28]And they take, like, right now, I can't shoot.
[344:43.48]See, now I can shoot, but I'm already, like, dead.
[344:47.68]If you want to shoot two times with a gun, you need to wait like a full second of walking before you can shoot again.
[344:54.17]That's why I'm throwing them.
[345:22.10]You're still alive.
[345:25.10]What?
[345:28.34]That was not a punch.
[345:31.71]That guy just threw, put his elbow in the air and accidentally touched me.
[345:35.49]That wasn't a punch.
[345:36.63]That wasn't a punching animation.
[345:38.21]He didn't throw a punch at me.
[345:38.97]He didn't hit me.
[345:39.71]He didn't do that.
[345:40.29]He didn't shush me.
[345:43.36]That was going good too.
[345:44.30]I had that one in the bag.
[345:54.93]Are you fucking kidding me?
[346:42.82]You gotta be shitting me.
[346:55.03]Ah, gotta stop that strategy.
[346:57.19]This is absolutely the final level in the whole game, by the way.
[347:20.06]There.
[347:20.22]I forgot the wrench.
[347:21.82]That's why I'm losing.
[347:22.44]I didn't do the wrench.
[347:23.08]Are you kidding me?
[347:27.46]Okay.
[347:28.34]This guy comes with a gun.
[347:30.71]So let's shoot him.
[347:33.49]Boink.
[347:34.87]You will get hit with that.
[347:35.91]Then I have a second here to throw potentially something at this guy.
[347:43.40]He's unloading already.
[347:49.62]At least he's the only person shooting.
[347:57.94]Guy's picking up the gun.
[348:04.93]Should work out, right?
[348:18.10]Down with the katana.
[348:18.66]There are people spawning.
[348:20.48]There are more people spawning.
[348:21.84]This is not ending.
[348:22.48]This is not going to end.
[348:30.18]I don't know if this is going to be shooting.
[348:34.34]I missed.
[348:37.04]Of all the times that I should have not missed, it was right there.
[348:39.59]Of all the times to not miss...
[348:48.95]One more guy.
[348:54.09]One more guy, right?
[348:54.77]No!
[348:55.19]More than one more guy.
[348:56.12]More than one more guy!
[349:15.09]This is crazy!
[349:18.21]This is fucking crazy!
[349:22.37]That had to have been the end, right?
[349:24.61]My god!
[349:29.65]I'm gonna... You know what?
[349:30.35]I'm trying a different strategy.
[349:31.49]We're gonna grab that gun and we're gonna go this way.
[349:40.89]Because then I can hide behind these things.
[349:44.25]Guy with the katana.
[349:45.24]He's dead.
[349:49.45]I can throw this at you.
[349:50.13]I can grab the fire extinguisher.
[349:51.49]He's not dead.
[349:52.73]He's still very much alive.
[350:06.33]Okay.
[350:07.23]So far so good.
[350:09.41]I want this other shotgun.
[350:10.85]Who's shooting?
[350:22.58]Okay, take it easy here.
[350:23.78]I have more shots in this gun.
[350:31.23]Okay, he's dead, right?
[350:34.81]That doesn't make any sense.
[350:35.45]I don't understand.
[350:40.15]He's dead.
[350:42.82]I need to move over here.
[350:45.72]Guy coming.
[350:47.30]Guy coming.
[350:57.85]Damn it!
[351:01.69]He just ruined everything.
[351:03.21]He literally just ruined everything.
[351:04.81]I didn't know what that was.
[351:05.67]I thought I had a virus.
[351:07.39]Thought I had a virus.
[351:08.53]That was gonna be a win.
[351:09.59]You did that at the worst time.
[351:28.40]That was the worst time you possibly could have done that.
[351:32.41]I thought that was an ad in like a virus or something.
[351:37.45]Fucking god dammit, just play the fucking first part and shoot her.
[351:43.34]Oh.
[351:44.58]Oh, that sucks.
[351:46.96]I really thought there was something wrong.
[351:51.13]Oh.
[352:05.29]That one was a win.
[352:07.45]If I do say so myself, that was a win.
[352:13.44]Now he's like blasting music in my ears.
[352:36.38]I'm so screwed.

[353:05.27]I can't do it.
[353:07.23]I can't play like this.
[353:09.21]Old-fashioned peeling is hard and wasteful.

[353:51.65]I got hit by a bullet.
[354:09.09]I just gotta keep moving.
[354:18.59]I'm having trouble actually determining if I'm hearing noises in the game or if he's playing noises outside the game.
[354:28.48]Give me a gun.
[354:31.64]What?
[354:31.94]That's not- No way!
[354:33.08]No fucking way!
[354:41.54]God, this is so hard.
[354:48.49]All right, the difficulty in this game, it really ramped the fuck up in the last level here, huh?
[354:56.92]Are you tired of peel, peel, peeling potatoes?
[354:59.44]Got it again.
[354:59.96]Stop.
[355:01.02]I'm having trouble actually determining if I'm hearing noises in the game or if he's playing noises outside the game.
[355:04.76]What's going on?
[355:05.08]What's happening?
[355:06.34]Introducing Handy Field, the...
[355:11.24]Why was I just talking?
[355:13.60]Am I talking right now?
[355:16.77]Am I talking right now?
[355:17.73]No.
[355:41.10]Didn't get it.
[355:42.52]I didn't get it.
[355:46.52]Oh my lord.
[355:47.12]This is insane.
[356:20.09]Okay, I gotta get that gun.
[356:20.86]I'm so dead.
[356:21.10]You know what?
[356:23.12]I really blame him.
[356:24.42]I was at the very end, and he scared the shit out of me.
[356:54.70]It's going to hit me, isn't it?
[356:57.77]That didn't hit me apparently somehow.
[357:11.18]I hope I can hit them both.
[357:19.85]Hope I got them both.
[357:26.35]I didn't even hit him?
[357:27.85]Holy shit.
[357:28.63]I had to do that, otherwise I might have gotten hit.
[357:36.54]He'll shoot his own friend, right?
[357:38.96]Right?
[357:39.82]Yep.
[358:02.90]I gotta determine where those bullets are going.
[358:10.29]That didn't hit him.
[358:10.99]That sucks such ass.
[358:13.07]Can you believe that?
[358:14.33]Can you believe that actually didn't hit him?
[358:16.77]I can't believe it.
[358:42.98]The fuck?
[358:43.53]Are you serious?
[358:44.45]Why are they getting eaten?
[358:46.60]Those bullets are getting eaten over here.
[359:10.81]The French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[359:17.32]Get me out of here.
[359:18.28]There is a California Champagne by Paul Masson.
[359:20.86]I did it.
[359:21.18]Inspired by that same French excellence.
[359:26.23]That's not even Orson Welles doing that, by the way.
[359:29.05]What are you getting eaten over here?
[359:30.77]It's not over.
[359:36.26]You're telling me it's not over?
[359:43.41]What is going on here?
[359:45.15]Alright, murdering people.
[359:52.48]I guess.
[359:58.20]Who are they shooting at?
[359:58.98]Is my body down here somewhere?
[360:01.64]Okay, can I hit them anywhere else besides the head?
[360:07.93]Zap them all.
[360:14.22]I did it!
[360:14.52]Yeah, I was controlling that.
[360:18.38]I was just killing people.
[360:26.02]Is that not the end?
[360:27.86]Did I still not beat it?
[360:30.22]That was crazy.
[360:31.88]That was so hard.
[360:32.52]Oh.
[360:46.50]Something is holding me back.
[360:49.00]I don't know about that, man.
[360:49.72]I just went into a pyramid and struck lightning into, like, 12 people's heads.
[360:54.86]You think I'm being held back?
[360:58.87]Dude, I'm, like, sweating right now.
[361:04.49]Oh, I hate this vision.
[361:11.32]Oh!
[361:11.58]Oh, God!
[361:12.46]Ow!
[361:13.36]What the fuck?! !
[361:16.65]That was not... That was uncalled for.
[361:21.05]That wasn't like an in-game sound.
[361:22.31]That was like we're breaking your headphones.
[361:25.61]That was not cool.
[361:27.79]Not cool game.
[361:38.32]That was... That was dumb.
[361:46.64]What?
[361:48.78]Set your mind free.
[361:53.56]Oh.
[361:55.32]Look it.
[361:57.82]All these screens will be playing video games.
[362:02.27]VR, guys.
[362:03.47]VR is the devil.
[362:06.17]If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do this right.
[362:15.65]Is this as far back as I can get?
[362:16.87]Oh, I guess I can go back a little further.
[362:21.13]Right over here.
[362:27.97]What?
[362:29.33]What do you mean, no?
[362:35.36]Keep it?
[362:36.70]What is going on?
[362:39.60]Why can't I...
[362:45.14]Okay, you know, I'm playing Videodrome.
[362:54.98]Software failure.
[362:56.64]Press the left mouse button.
[362:57.72]Am I dead?
[363:01.26]Oh yeah, here comes the rock music.
[363:16.17]Whose band is this?
[363:17.03]This is so loud.
[363:18.33]Oh my god.
[363:18.83]This is so loud.
[363:28.22]Get me out of here.
[363:29.22]It hurts.
[363:33.04]Yeah, for a second I couldn't tell if that was Star doing that.
[363:44.67]Is that the end?
[363:47.08]One of us.
[363:51.04]I don't think that was the end.
[363:58.94]Give us your friends.
[364:00.64]Give us names.
[364:02.68]Okay.
[364:03.78]Jerry Springfield.
[364:07.37]This is so loud.
[364:09.21]Get me out of here.
[364:10.33]It hurts.
[364:15.51]Yeah, for a second I couldn't tell if that was Star doing that.
[364:18.17]Hey, Star.
[364:20.31]Are you here?
[364:23.11]Star?
[364:27.95]I'd like to talk to you for a second.
[364:32.64]There's this really innovative shooter that you should check it out.
[364:40.42]It's the most innovative shooter.
[364:41.54]You know, you should probably play it.
[364:42.34]It's really innovative.
[364:43.78]You should check it out.
[364:48.53]Yeah, don't spoil... Well, I've just spoiled this, apparently.
[364:58.36]Congratulations.
[364:59.80]You are now free to play Superhot forever.
[365:06.14]So I unlocked endless mode and there's challenges.
[365:13.25]Spread and promote the game.
[365:15.80]Hello.
[365:16.10]Hey, uh... Is this a really innovative shooter?
[365:18.48]You get to check out... Yeah, this is... Dude, you like shooters, right?
[365:21.91]I like shooters.
[365:23.13]Well, there's this new innovative shooter out here.
[365:24.73]It's called Superhot.
[365:25.95]Peel, peel, peel.
[365:27.11]Yeah, I don't want to... I don't want to tell you too much about it.
[365:29.19]It's pretty cool.
[365:31.05]Um... You should just go download it and play it.
[365:33.80]And, you know, it's... Is it like a one-hour experience for like $25?
[365:36.08]I, uh... Ah...
[365:43.38]No, that was like two and a half hours.
[365:45.40]Well, you weren't good at it.
[365:48.18]It's a blind playthrough of the game.
[365:53.51]You could armchair all you want.
[365:55.97]That was like a complete... I never even heard of the game before.
[365:58.39]You told me, oh, it's been around for ages.
[365:59.87]I played it 20 years ago.
[366:01.71]I never played it.
[366:02.79]It's been around for a while.
[366:06.28]You know what?
[366:07.92]Go get the game and go get fucking your brain linked up and go become one of us.
[366:11.34]I wasn't supposed to tell you, but I want you like your brain fried.
[366:14.14]Go get it.
[366:15.36]I wouldn't mind having my brain fried.
[366:17.18]I kind of wanted to play, but you just wouldn't stop.
[366:19.16]I was just like, fine, I'll watch him.
[366:22.18]Kind of wanted to play?
[366:23.16]What the hell are you talking about?
[366:24.56]I wanted to play Superhot, but like I was watching you.
[366:27.30]So go play it.
[366:30.86]You're a very odd person.
[366:33.16]No, I... Why am I weird?
[366:35.44]Just go play it.
[366:37.07]I was thinking of streaming it, and you were streaming it.
[366:38.89]I don't know.
[366:40.93]I just kept thinking about wine and the kids.
[366:46.68]Yeah.
[366:46.90]I just want to see what this is.
[366:50.64]Taking care of the business, taking care of my kids.
[366:57.09]Just go get your brain deleted from this game.
[366:58.93]I was immune to it.
[367:09.79]So this just, okay, it's essentially you just keep doing this over and over again in the same area?
[367:15.95]Yeah.
[367:16.39]This is cool.
[367:17.35]That, I'm pretty sure, is what was available for free for a very long time.
[367:20.69]Really?
[367:24.04]Really makes you wonder.
[367:27.87]I mean, that was a game.
[367:28.99]That was a cool game.
[367:31.19]Was it $25?
[367:33.51]Maybe not.
[367:35.11]But, I mean, it was definitely fun.
[367:36.51]I definitely enjoyed it.
[367:38.19]That guy just got shot in the head by somebody that... Break all the beakers.
[367:53.40]Beakers, beakers, beakers.
[367:54.58]Which one's the love potion?
[367:58.89]Quick, Star, drink this.
[368:01.56]I'm in love with you now.
[368:02.80]Oh, yes, it worked.
[368:05.02]All right.
[368:10.81]Well, yeah, that was, um... That was fun.
[368:13.93]That was a lot of fun.
[368:15.17]But it was a little short, and... It's kind of a little steep on the price point, but, you know.
[368:23.64]there's there's the thing I was thinking like oh when german's done like I'll beat it I'll play the game but it's like I didn't expect you to beat it and I'm sitting here I thought you were gonna stop streaming early and I didn't think it would be that short how long was it completely like watching I don't remember when you started playing I mean there's a bunch of like challenges and stuff too are the challenges like other levels I'm assuming they probably are without a story
[368:51.32]I think the challenge is being the best that you can be.
[368:54.65]You know what I mean?
[368:55.65]Well, let's find out.
[368:56.25]But I kind of want to make peel, peel, peel my subs now.
[369:01.01]That's the project.
[369:01.88]That's the priority.
[369:03.48]That sounds like a project you can do.
[369:09.48]Ah!
[369:15.76]ninja challenge faster movement no punching use katana no throwing except katana oh damn zero out of 25 so what you have to do every level with the katana only is that how I understand this yeah it is so you start you pretty there's 25 levels
[369:43.44]And you have to do... That's kind of cool.
[369:47.08]What are the other ones?
[369:48.18]I guess you have to beat them in succession.
[369:53.24]Let me see the other ones.
[370:00.04]Speedrun.
[370:01.94]Timed in-game.
[370:02.90]Regular gameplay with a timer.
[370:05.17]Ticking only when you move.
[370:09.57]Speedrun RT.
[370:11.89]Real time.
[370:15.33]I mean, there's a lot here.
[370:16.21]I guess if you're really into it, you really could just... There's a lot to do.
[370:22.13]I mean, what are you gonna do?
[370:23.79]If you wanna play Superhot, are you gonna buy the cheaper version of Superhot that doesn't exist?
[370:29.22]What do you mean?
[370:31.76]I mean... It's just...
[370:35.72]I guess the cheaper version of Superhot is Superhot.
[370:39.18]I don't know.
[370:40.22]That's all I think is weird about it.
[370:41.62]I'd be 100% be like, yeah, price point's fine, whatever, as long as it hasn't been like a playable demo for as long as it has been.
[370:51.41]I mean, it's on sale right now for $22, but it's normally, what, $25?
[370:56.23]Normally $67.
[371:02.78]Like, 15 to 20, like, yeah.
[371:04.36]I mean, it's good.
[371:07.20]It's definitely, like, I was interested enough to keep carrying and play through the whole thing.
[371:12.11]Usually, with a game like that, I'll play, like, the first 5 or 10 levels and be like, that was kind of cool.
[371:17.71]I'm done.
[371:18.27]I don't want to do this anymore.
[371:19.19]But I, like, actually really wanted to beat it.
[371:22.89]You're really cute, too.
[371:25.37]Oh, thank you.
[371:27.97]Potion, man.
[371:35.02]do I do this you have to check out this game rectagon does none of these work choo-choo why doesn't choo-choo work it's a word nine on page 26.
[372:09.69]Unregistered copy?
[372:12.31]I bought this game on Steam.
[372:13.25]What are you talking about?
[372:21.67]I think we've been accustomed to lower price points in games.
[372:24.32]Thinking about how much work and time that goes into a game, especially Spawn.
[372:26.92]Yeah.
[372:31.92]That's true.
[372:34.73]I bought it.
[372:36.29]I saw how long it was.
[372:37.85]I bought it.
[372:39.43]Well, look at it this way.
[372:43.00]You can go in and play multiple times.
[372:45.12]There's many ways to play it.
[372:46.62]My only complaint, like I was saying, was that it had a free downloadable demo.
[372:50.66]Unless I'm like... Are you sure you're not crazy?
[372:53.60]I don't think I am.
[372:57.45]Or you could do the endless mode.
[372:59.01]And you kind of feel like... That's the big part of the game.
[373:05.99]Yeah.
[373:13.67]Actually, it's been two years.
[373:15.67]Hey, wait a minute, hold on.
[373:16.33]This game was originally made during Game Jam in 2014.
[373:18.31]Sorry, I'm going to have to rebuttal you here.
[373:21.04]It is worth it.
[373:21.66]This game is absolutely worth it.
[373:22.94]You know why?
[373:23.74]Why?
[373:24.44]It's got TreeDude.
[373:26.24]TreeDude.
[373:26.64]Oh, I forgot it was a two for one.
[373:28.90]Is there 700,000 games in there?
[373:29.56]TreeDude.
[373:33.75]How could you forget about true to this games worth 50 bucks I
[373:54.85]There are games that have less content that have more than $25.
[373:57.51]That's true.
[373:59.85]I think really we are just, I'm just like so used to games being less money, and that's true.
[374:08.80]But it's a really awesome concept, really super cool idea.
[374:13.00]And you guys heard me when I was playing it.
[374:14.24]I was talking about how fucking, like how much of a blast it is.
[374:16.38]So you know what?
[374:17.90]Maybe it is worth it.
[374:24.80]Definitely a fun game.
[374:29.26]And for people that are really completionists, there's a lot to do.
[374:35.41]Alright, I got to 100.
[374:37.93]Okay, quit.
[374:38.31]Alright.
[374:38.53]That's going to wrap it up, guys.
[374:53.84]uh can you hold on you know just hang out for one like I I think I am gonna play through it and I'm gonna start my stream in like one second you're going and we can do like we can do a flip flop you know what I mean but you just watched me play you know you know where all those jump scares are I know so you as you were saying the whole time you were playing the jump scares would be interesting to like see someone who wasn't bad at it like play it and speedrun it right yeah I mean like speedrun as in like you play a shitload of it and know exactly what you're doing and where to go
[375:22.85]Yeah, I mean, that would be cool, but I just want to play it, and I want it to stream, and I'm just going to do it.
[375:28.43]You can't stop me.
[375:29.69]You can't stop me from doing this, you understand?
