[00:08.58]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.94]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.94]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Medic.
[00:19.14]It's been a million years.
[00:20.95]I know, I'm sorry.
[00:22.33]My last Medic video was, like, at least two months ago.
[00:26.03]I mean, I've done live commentaries and, of course, livestream stuff with the Medic, but I haven't done a sit-down, discussion, thought-out Medic commentary since I was, like, 11 years old.
[00:37.35]We are gonna change that right now, gonna talk about the Kritzkrieg, gonna bring up why it is my favorite out of all the Mediguns.
[00:43.83]Well, there's only three, but it is my favorite out of the three.
[00:46.96]There's a couple of different reasons for that, and I will get into them.
[00:49.62]But I also want to talk about computer upgrades in this video as well, because I just bought a bunch of them, and I spent all last night putting it all together.
[00:58.12]And it can be kind of a headache, and it can be really irritating sometimes, but the end result is awesome.
[01:04.14]I have a pretty much a brand new computer,
[01:06.45]Well, it's like taking the engine out of a Chevy and putting it into something else, you know what I mean?
[01:10.79]It's still the same case, but it's got different stuff in it.
[01:14.67]And, of course, I want to tell you what stuff I put into it.
[01:17.85]But first, we're going to talk about the Kritzkrieg right now!
[01:22.92]What kind of transition was that?
[01:25.78]What am I, introducing a king?
[01:27.60]And here he is, your Grace, the almighty Kritzkrieg!
[01:31.82]M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m!
[01:33.66]All hail the Kritzkrieg, your Grace!
[01:35.82]I'm watching too many episodes of Game of Thrones.
[01:40.36]Anyways, the Kritzkrieg is my favorite pub Medi Gun.
[01:43.99]Now, specifically because of the word I just used, pub.
[01:47.55]This is the easiest Medi Gun to jump into a game and just play with.
[01:51.85]Because you never really have to coordinate Ubers.
[01:54.21]This is the only Medi Gun where if you pop an Uber on somebody, Kritzkrieg on someone...
[01:59.26]It doesn't matter if you timed it right or if there's a sentry around the corner or something like that.
[02:03.94]When you use the Kritzkrieg, you are going to get some benefit no matter who you do it to or when you do it.
[02:10.06]As long as you're weary of people's reload times, that's the number one thing you need to remember.
[02:15.07]Because if you pop a Kritzkrieg randomly on a soldier, a Demoman, or really anybody that has to reload their weapon, you're kind of putting yourself in a bad situation, because they might not even have anything to shoot.
[02:27.06]And even if they do, even if they have one or two rockets or one or two grenades or something,
[02:31.70]It's, you put them into freak out mode because they go, why?
[02:34.93]How many times has that happened to you?
[02:35.99]It happens to me all the time when I get crits creaked and I have one rocket or two rockets inside of my rocket launcher and I go, okay, hold on.
[02:44.03]Do I shoot?
[02:44.51]No, reload.
[02:45.13]And you can make the person really, really uncomfortable.
[02:47.53]So remember that when you have your crits creak ready to go.
[02:50.75]Besides that, and of course knowing where enemies are, and if there's going to be more than one or two people around a corner, that's the only coordination you need with the Kritzkrieg, at least in a public game standpoint.
[03:01.80]Now with the Uber Charge, or even with the Quick-Fix, you need to know where sentries are, you need to know who to Uber, you need to know when to do it, but with the Kritzkrieg, a lot of that pressure is taken off your shoulders, and you just become a healer.
[03:14.58]You don't have to worry about really anything else, and if you Kritzkrieg somebody, oh I Kritzkrieg that soldier, what do you do, kill two people?
[03:21.35]Sick!
[03:21.99]Nice job, dude!
[03:23.41]It's not like with the Uber, where you do it to somebody, turn a corner, Sentry's there.
[03:27.48]Sentry doesn't go down, and everyone is just like... That doesn't really happen.
[03:36.60]But it does need to be noted that this kind of carefree Kritzkrieg... I just made a tongue twister right there.
[03:42.80]Kind of carefree Kritzkrieg.
[03:45.44]This style only really works when there's another medic on the team that's using regular uber or you're on defense.
[03:52.11]Because obviously if you're on offense and there's a bunch of sentries around, you're not going to be able to really push anywhere.
[03:57.15]So keep that in mind.
[03:59.17]So with that, let's transition to talking about computer parts.
[04:03.33]I want to bring up this because I'm so excited.
[04:05.67]I just got three new additions to this little home of a computer here.
[04:10.12]I got a GTX 670 and I used to have a GTX 470.
[04:14.78]So that's the video card upgrade.
[04:16.32]I'm loving that.
[04:17.10]It's awesome.
[04:18.12]It's so much cooler than the 470.
[04:20.38]I will say that.
[04:20.94]Oh my god.
[04:22.14]My 470, I used to have to put the fans up to 75% to keep games like Team Fortress or even Diablo 3 to stop from running at like 90 degrees Celsius.
[04:33.33]That's how insane that is.
[04:34.93]So that's a huge upgrade for me.
[04:36.67]The second big thing is I got six more gigs of RAM.
[04:39.84]So instead of six gigs, now I have 12 gigs, which is obviously going to help so much with video editing.
[04:45.45]And I got another hard drive.
[04:46.81]So I have a brand new 7200 RPM hard drive in here now, internal.
[04:51.27]I was using an external hard drive for a lot of my recording stuff through eSATA.
[04:55.82]So I'm glad to throw that thing in the garbage.
[04:57.96]Get rid of it.
[04:58.54]I hated that thing.
[05:00.08]The one thing I could not upgrade, which it's kind of... If you're gonna do that, you might as well buy a new computer.
[05:06.45]I wanted to upgrade the processor.
[05:08.27]I have a 950, i7-950 in here.
[05:09.09]It's overclocked.
[05:11.89]And it's getting kind of old, which scares me a little bit.
[05:14.75]But I couldn't really do anything about it.
[05:16.85]I think the sockets in this thing and this motherboard only allow the old generation i7s.
[05:21.76]So I wouldn't even be able to get one of the new ones.
[05:24.20]I'm not that concerned about it, though.
[05:25.38]I got these upgrades.
[05:26.44]I'm good to go for a while.
[05:27.90]I'll cross the processor bridge when I have to.
[05:30.24]But for now, I'm fine.
[05:31.96]So that wraps up this video, guys.
[05:33.82]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:35.24]I really do appreciate it.
[05:36.64]And I'll catch you guys all soon.
[05:38.29]So take care, everybody.
