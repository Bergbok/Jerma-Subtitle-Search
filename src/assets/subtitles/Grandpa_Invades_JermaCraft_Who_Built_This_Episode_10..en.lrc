[00:08.30]Hello, everybody.
[00:09.48]Welcome to episode 10 of JermaCraft.
[00:13.06]Sorry it's been about a week since I last... Oh my god, a wolf.
[00:16.96]What do I do?
[00:19.78]Oh my god.
[00:20.28]Oh my god, he's mad.
[00:20.96]He's mad.
[00:22.19]No, get away from me.
[00:24.49]I didn't want to have to come to this.
[00:26.87]Oh.
[00:28.53]I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf.
[00:30.19]I did not mean to kill you.
[00:33.01]But anyways, we're in the Forest of Wondrous Secrets.
[00:37.70]Or something like that.
[00:38.44]I have no idea.
[00:39.00]But let's just keep going here.
[00:41.22]I'm going to... What is this?
[00:45.22]What the hell is this?
[00:48.07]What?
[00:50.73]Who built the castle?
[00:53.73]Oh my god.
[00:55.81]Grandpa!
[00:56.13]Grandpa!
[00:57.94]Need to talk to you.
[00:58.90]Get down here.
[00:59.68]What?
[01:00.04]What the hell?
[01:00.94]Did you build a... What the hell is this?
[01:03.36]It's a castle.
[01:03.98]What is this?
[01:04.84]It's a castle.
[01:05.56]You can't see that with your own eyes, you stupid.
[01:07.62]Hold on.
[01:07.94]You built a castle?
[01:09.26]Yes.
[01:09.84]You... It was fucking easy.
[01:12.08]You have a moat?
[01:12.90]How the hell did you get this?
[01:14.16]It took me like ten minutes.
[01:15.48]Does the bridge come down?
[01:16.78]No, it doesn't.
[01:17.54]It's for show.
[01:18.92]Are you freaking kidding me?
[01:20.88]How did you do this so fast?
[01:22.38]It's probably like in the top ten easiest things I've ever done.
[01:25.93]So you built a castle.
[01:27.31]Yes.
[01:28.07]You've got to be shitting me.
[01:30.97]So what the hell else have you done?
[01:32.65]I mean, you built a castle.
[01:34.09]What else?
[01:34.67]Why don't you go check around the back there?
[01:36.09]Why?
[01:36.19]What's in there?
[01:36.77]There's a secret stash over there.
[01:38.03]What are you talking about?
[01:38.86]Go check.
[01:39.24]Go take a look.
[01:39.74]Oh, okay.
[01:41.02]Yep.
[01:41.44]What do you got in here?
[01:42.32]Nothing.
[01:43.00]Oh, my God.
[01:43.90]Just a bunch of fucking diamonds.
[01:45.84]This is ridiculous.
[01:46.72]It's not ridiculous.
[01:47.69]Hold on.
[01:48.03]Back up.
[01:48.73]I am really, really confused right now.
[01:50.51]You've played for, like, three days.
[01:52.67]How do you have this many diamonds?
[01:54.17]It's not possible.
[01:54.87]No, it's not.
[01:55.55]It's easy.
[01:56.05]Like, diamond everything?
[01:57.99]Diamond armor?
[01:58.77]Diamond swords?
[01:59.53]Listen, listen.
[02:00.19]You just have to be good.
[02:01.19]Wait a second.
[02:02.71]Wait a second.
[02:03.35]What?
[02:03.45]What are you doing?
[02:04.96]Wait, what?
[02:06.14]You're playing in creative mode.
[02:07.83]No, I'm not.
[02:08.53]I knew I loaded up the wrong game.
[02:09.65]I'm not playing in fucking creative mode.
[02:11.47]Trying to, like... You shut up.
[02:12.97]No, but, I mean, creative mode doesn't have... You don't have to gather resources.
[02:16.55]I was wondering.
[02:17.63]I was like, what the hell's going on?
[02:18.73]How did he build smooth stone so fast?
[02:19.97]I'm trying to make you look better.
[02:21.35]Because you said you were going to build a castle, and you never did it.
[02:24.27]So I took the liberty to build a castle for you.
[02:27.68]And you're going to do this to me now?
[02:29.22]You're going to throw it right back in my face?
[02:31.28]No, I just didn't know that that was the... Well, I was trying to make people think that you were good at Minecraft, and I just figured maybe you would appreciate it, and maybe you'd like it, but... No, I do.
[02:41.70]I'm sorry.
[02:42.74]No, I'm sorry.
[02:43.62]Come here, come here, give me a hug.
[02:44.78]Come on, give me a big one right here.
[02:46.54]Yeah, that's a good one.
[02:48.93]So let's go get some ice cream, huh?
[02:50.83]My treat.
[02:51.89]I have a dollar twenty-five, which should buy us one like kitty cone and we can share it.
[02:57.17]Uh, I'll just buy it.
[02:58.33]Okay, that works too.
[02:59.47]Okay.
[03:00.21]So, uh, thank you guys so much for watching.
[03:02.73]I really do appreciate it.
[03:04.09]Just wanted to throw this together, a special episode ten, because I did promise you guys a castle.
[03:10.37]So here's the castle.
[03:11.75]It's a piece of crap, but at least I tried, right?
[03:15.42]Or at least Grandpa tried.
[03:16.94]So where this series is going to go in the future now after Episode 10, I'm not really sure.
[03:21.02]I think I want to try and do a duel Let's Play with somebody.
[03:24.77]Get on a multiplayer server and do something fun.
[03:26.95]Maybe do some mods.
[03:28.11]We will see where it goes from here.
[03:30.01]But yeah, thanks again for watching.
[03:31.85]I will see you all next time.
[03:33.31]And take care, everybody.
[03:35.15]Right, Grandpa?
[03:36.13]Take care, everybody.
