[00:00.21]I'm going to change this to Metro.
[00:06.64]Metro, this is Last Light Redux.
[00:13.08]I have both the Redux versions beat Metro.
[00:18.23]That's good to go.
[00:21.77]Pull that up and open up Metro.
[00:29.73]Metro!
[00:31.25]Here it comes.
[00:31.63]It's gonna be kind of loud.
[00:36.98]I do apologize for that.
[00:37.98]It's gonna be a little loud.
[00:41.68]Oops-a-daisy.
[00:48.27]Oops-a-daisy.
[00:50.69]Can you see it?
[00:51.17]What's going on here?
[00:58.95]I had a fairly good time in the first one, so.
[01:06.30]One thing I don't like about the Metro games, I'm going to say, here's a complaint for the Metro games.
[01:11.18]Do we need the long, in-engine, you-can't-skip cutscene in the very beginning when you turn the game on every time?
[01:18.39]Like, I mean, does it really have to be there?
[01:22.71]Every single fucking time.
[01:31.71]Yes, it does.
[01:33.94]Well, now it's not even getting captured.
[01:36.16]Come on, you fucking idiot.
[01:37.54]Let's go.
[01:42.66]Come on!
[01:43.84]What are you doing?
[01:44.66]Let me try and reload it again.
[01:50.67]Hold on.
[01:54.85]Pull it in, please.
[02:00.76]Reel it in, please.
[02:05.89]Is it... Alright, did, like, did my, like, OBS just break?
[02:13.51]Oh my fucking lord.
[02:20.74]Why?
[02:21.88]It was just fucking working!
[02:25.44]Yeah, so you guys are just seeing a black screen right now.
[02:27.84]Because, uh...
[02:29.87]Metro decided that it just didn't want to get game captured anymore.
[02:33.31]That's fucking great.
[02:34.83]Awesome.
[02:40.40]Oh my fucking god.
[02:42.30]What a joke.
[02:44.80]Dude, can somebody please make streaming software that isn't a piece of fucking garbage?
[02:51.71]Is that, like, possible for someone to do that?
[02:54.15]Can somebody please do it?
[02:56.45]Get, like, fucking George Lucas to make this shit.
[02:58.78]I'll buy a LucasArts fucking stream software.
[03:00.76]You know what I'm saying?
[03:02.84]Where's the Walmart brand?
[03:04.08]I'll take a Walmart brand.
[03:08.20]Like, I will buy a Walmart brand stream software.
[03:15.39]Please, make it.
[03:18.23]I would invest in that.
[03:31.20]Oh, I have to restart the game.
[03:32.81]That's fucking great.
[03:37.97]Somebody call Mark Zuckerberg and say, hey, make a fucking OBS competitor.
[03:45.93]Jesus fucking yeah Walmart would never make it Well, I reloaded the game can you but you cannot see it Hey look now you can magically magically, you know, we're talking magic Goodness gracious
[04:14.76]Hey, did you guys know this is inspired by a fucking novel?
[04:17.79]Let's make sure to remind you of that every time you open the game.
[04:24.19]Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay.
[04:25.83]Alright, new game.
[04:33.99]Metro Last Light.
[04:34.95]Personal Spun.
[04:39.57]Inspired by a book that nobody reads.
[04:42.13]That's not true.
[04:44.23]We're going to do Spartan.
[04:47.77]We did Spartan last.
[04:48.65]I mean, sorry.
[04:49.81]We're doing Survival.
[04:52.69]We're doing Ranger and Survival because that's what we did last time.
[05:00.99]I'm going to read the book on stream.
[05:05.05]Ranger.
[05:05.47]There we are.
[05:11.54]Okay, Metro, last one.
[05:14.08]I'm ready to start.
[05:15.61]This is my old starting soon screen.
[05:24.91]Nightmarish creatures.
[05:27.39]Creepy as a man turned inside out.
[05:31.05]Monsters born to destroy us.
[05:34.79]The word was they were incredibly strong and unnaturally evil.
[05:39.43]that with bare paws they could tear armed men apart.
[05:43.28]That's all lies.
[05:46.68]That's all lies?
[05:52.05]Truth is even scarier.
[05:54.03]I wish if you just said, real eyes, real eyes, real eyes.
[05:59.09]And then it went right to the title card.
[06:08.20]Well, I used to live nearby.
[06:11.04]Before the war, I mean.
[06:12.74]Up there.
[06:14.06]I was on the train when it happened.
[06:16.75]I tried calling my family, but couldn't get through.
[06:19.51]You guys ever heard that before?
[06:21.85]Real eyes.
[06:23.39]Real eyes.
[06:24.29]Real lies.
[06:25.27]This is loud as all heck.
[06:29.02]Hold on, guys.
[06:29.54]This is loud as all heck.
[06:30.52]I gotta turn this down.
[06:32.04]Sound.
[06:32.56]Turn that volume down.
[06:33.44]Loud as all heck.
[06:34.14]You know what I'm saying?
[06:37.67]Yeah, that's okay.
[06:41.60]I like the feel.
[06:42.12]I'm going to turn the sensitivity down.
[06:43.98]Let's get that out of the way.
[06:47.62]Mouse.
[06:48.30]Sensitivity.
[06:49.00]Bing.
[06:49.66]Bing.
[06:51.88]Need that low sense.
[06:53.11]No.
[06:53.59]It needs to be a little bit higher.
[06:54.65]One more.
[06:55.07]One more knock to the right.
[07:02.43]One more.
[07:03.43]I'm really botching this immersion for you guys, by the way.
[07:07.20]Sorry about that.
[07:10.04]Why is this not saving?
[07:14.80]So, shoot them, right?
[07:17.23]No.
[07:20.27]Oh, wow.
[07:20.53]I just got force pushed.
[07:23.35]Are they turning into animals?
[07:24.49]What are they turning?
[07:25.03]I don't understand what's going on here.
[07:30.73]Did I just kill all my friends?
[07:31.93]Yeah, I am.
[07:33.55]Damn.
[07:34.65]This is getting real wacky.
[07:42.64]Wacky?
[07:43.02]No, this is deep and scary and horrible.
[07:44.84]Wacky.
[07:50.72]Wacky.
[08:01.22]This is wacky.
[08:02.26]Oh, I'm the same guy?
[08:03.06]I'm Artyom?
[08:03.50]So this is a direct sequel.
[08:04.64]See, I got the good ending.
[08:06.82]I got the real ending.
[08:30.47]Am I like fucking three feet tall?
[08:32.97]What's going on here?
[08:33.77]Am I a baby?
[08:50.00]Why am I so... Oh, no, no, no.
[08:51.72]Okay, right, right.
[08:53.94]I'm sitting down.
[08:56.68]Implying I beat the last game?
[08:58.33]I played the last game last week and I beat it on stream.
[09:01.65]What the hell are you talking about?
[09:02.95]Can I get control yet?
[09:13.13]Hmm, got a journal.
[09:15.93]Got my bullet lighter.
[09:18.14]Fashionable.
[09:19.44]What else we got?
[09:20.48]Anything else on the desk?
[09:23.70]Nope.
[09:25.84]Turn lights on and off.
[09:26.70]Wow, I got my Kylo Ren helmet.
[09:30.66]Let me do this real quick.
[09:32.35]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[09:35.09]Like that.
[09:38.38]Okay.
[09:41.45]Don't tell me.
[09:42.11]Don't tell me that I can't do that.
[09:44.01]I can't do that, can I?
[09:46.21]No, I can't.
[09:47.63]So, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot see the other monitor for the whole stream.
[09:51.94]I have to restart the game.
[09:55.38]Why?
[09:56.16]Why on earth?
[09:58.70]Why does this fucking happen?
[10:01.14]What happened?
[10:01.78]I hit alt tab and I can't play the game anymore.
[10:07.12]It's one of these games.
[10:08.46]Great.
[10:24.83]I'm so, so annoyed right now.
[10:28.17]Hey.
[10:28.77]Hey, by the way, everybody, did you know?
[10:30.28]If you were curious, you know, ding, ding, dong, ding, ding.
[10:36.69]Hey, you kids need to learn how to read books sometimes.
[10:42.97]Because this game is based on a true story written by Dimitri in 2033.
[10:48.70]All right.
[10:53.86]Please, let's go.
[11:02.83]Are you okay?
[11:03.69]No, not right now.
[11:05.82]I'm fucking angry right now.
[11:08.94]Fighting against bad internet and now I'm fighting against like my streaming software being a piece of shit.
[11:15.66]Ugh, new game, wait, no.
[11:18.00]You guys can see this, right?
[11:19.08]Am I, are we, you guys can see this, right?
[11:22.26]I just wanna make sure that that's possible before I go.
[11:26.36]You can see this?
[11:31.89]Okay, good.
[11:37.44]You can see this, right?
[11:38.82]Because I cannot see the other monitor.
[11:41.25]Yeah, something's wrong there.
[11:42.43]Don't matter.
[11:43.11]Everything's always wrong.
[11:45.23]Dude, I'm going to make my own streaming software.
[11:46.65]I'm going to make my own fucking internet.
[11:48.89]I'm going to make my own streaming software, my own internet in my own house.
[11:51.79]I'm going to build my own house with my bare hands.
[11:58.31]Fuck this.
[11:58.73]I ain't like having somebody else have to like run my life.
[12:01.49]You know what I mean?
[12:01.93]I'm gonna build my own house.
[12:03.23]I'm gonna make my own bank.
[12:05.63]I'm gonna make my own bread.
[12:07.24]I'm gonna make my own milk.
[12:11.94]Can we talk about that for a second, by the way?
[12:14.74]So, if you don't know, I was in a snowstorm.
[12:17.08]A pretty bad one.
[12:19.09]And... I don't know what it is with people.
[12:21.85]But for some reason... Why do people buy bread and milk?
[12:29.45]What's the bread and milk story there?
[12:31.73]You go to a grocery... It doesn't matter what grocery store you go to.
[12:33.83]Go to any grocery store before, like, a snowstorm or before, like, a hurricane or something.
[12:38.38]Especially, like, a snowstorm.
[12:39.30]I don't understand.
[12:40.24]You're gonna eat a bunch of bread for, like, a day?
[12:44.10]I wouldn't eat bread... I won't be able to eat a loaf of bread in two days.
[12:48.74]Three days.
[12:49.24]Four days.
[12:50.84]Why do people... What, are you just chugging milk in your basement?
[12:53.62]Why do people buy bread and milk?
[12:55.08]Why don't you buy, like, food? ...
[13:00.44]To eat where you can eat a bunch of bread?
[13:02.07]But it's only bread and milk.
[13:09.79]It's nothing else.
[13:12.17]You go to any other aisle in the grocery store, and it's full.
[13:21.04]But people are going to just slam, eat like loaves of bread and chug milk.
[13:26.58]What the hell are you doing?
[13:32.68]Who the fuck drinks milk on a regular basis anyways?
[13:41.37]Give me my mask.
[13:42.47]Yeah, I won't.
[13:43.29]I remember how to play this game.
[13:51.83]Here's my point, right?
[13:53.79]If it's gonna snow and you're gonna be like kind of locked in your house for a day Why would you buy a loaf of like two or three loaves of bread?
[14:17.22]You're gonna be fine.
[14:18.86]Why do people freak the fuck out when it snows outside?
[14:28.55]Like I said, I can't eat a loaf of bread in a week, let alone like 16 hours.
[14:32.69]Alright.
[14:41.87]Let me pay attention to what the fucking guy was just telling me to do.
[14:44.85]Because I was too busy being angry.
[14:49.54]What does he want me to do?
[14:51.50]No.
[14:51.88]Talk to him.
[14:53.94]Choose.
[14:54.50]Choose.
[14:57.52]First weapon, right?
[14:59.01]I want to... Let's go with that.
[15:03.29]Assault rifle.
[15:08.33]A bastard.
[15:13.30]This is based on one person buying bread and milk?
[15:15.38]No, dude.
[15:15.84]Go to the grocery store.
[15:17.50]Look at Kim's Twitter.
[15:20.06]Go look at the bread aisle.
[15:21.10]She took a picture of it.
[15:23.08]It's fucking empty.
[15:26.14]EMPTY.
[15:30.25]Uh... Shotgun.
[15:34.67]Customize this.
[15:35.71]I think it's already good.
[15:37.45]Am I getting these for free?
[15:39.47]I don't understand.
[15:45.75]Don't I have to pay for this shit?
[15:49.36]Or if I get... Is this just, hey, get this for free because it's the very beginning of the game?
[15:53.28]Who cares?
[15:56.56]Apparently.
[15:57.80]Uh, reflex sight.
[16:04.53]And... As long as the other silencers are on bolt.
[16:11.88]I guess.
[16:13.58]What matters.
[16:15.79]Now what?
[16:16.85]Press the button.
[16:22.61]This is a shotgun.
[16:28.41]It's a shotgun.
[16:29.69]I got it for free.
[16:30.69]What?
[16:31.85]Don't get mad at me because I installed something that was free.
[16:39.41]If the guy was going to give it to you for free, you would take it.
[16:43.57]It's a good shotgun.
[16:44.31]It's alright.
[16:45.65]Don't worry.
[16:47.15]See?
[16:47.75]We got like a red dot sight on it.
[16:49.03]Wait, did I turn off the silencer on this shotgun?
[16:51.77]It's a scope on a pistol.
[16:54.13]Yes, that's how we do it around here.
[16:56.23]Okay?
[16:58.27]You'd take it off?
[16:58.97]No, you'd look cool.
[16:59.91]You'd be able to show it to your friends.
[17:02.13]Let me do this.
[17:06.99]Let's put an extended barrel.
[17:10.40]I forgot to put the silencer.
[17:11.88]You can't silence a shotgun.
[17:18.12]That's fine.
[17:21.25]Let's go.
[17:23.79]Free stuff?
[17:25.89]Free AK?
[17:26.53]Do I have three slots in this game or just two?
[17:28.23]I only have two still.
[17:32.61]Um... I think... I don't... Yeah, fuck this thing.
[17:35.63]If it's gonna be for free... I think I want to try something else that I've never tried before.
[17:42.69]Like an SMG or something.
[17:43.69]Bastard.
[17:48.45]I feel like I want a bastard.
[17:52.48]No, I'm going with bastard.
[17:54.00]It's final.
[17:58.36]Silenced bastard.
[18:02.56]Let's try it.
[18:03.98]Oh, this is the battery gun.
[18:09.02]Yeah.
[18:09.74]You guys saw how good I was at this thing?
[18:17.86]Silence that mustard.
[18:21.14]Yeah, you know what?
[18:21.96]Screw it.
[18:22.88]Let's just go with the standard.
[18:25.41]SMG.
[18:27.73]Get an AK.
[18:30.61]No.
[18:32.27]I want bastard shotgun.
[18:33.43]5.45 rounds of batteries.
[18:34.37]Yeah.
[18:44.41]I'm going to regret it.
[18:45.79]Why would I regret it?
[18:47.27]What?
[18:47.43]You don't want to do it the easy way?
[18:49.70]What are they eating?
[18:51.12]They're eating worms.
[18:52.12]Worms, salmon, and bread.
[18:53.84]Where's your milk?
[18:54.38]Okay.
[19:14.43]What?
[19:14.83]It's two more because I didn't pick up an AK?
[19:16.21]What?
[19:17.21]What?
[19:25.22]All you guys that are yelling at me right now don't know that the battery gun is my weapon of choice.
[19:29.55]Got a couple of filters.
[19:30.71]Do I need my mask on?
[19:32.85]Yeah, all you need in life.
[19:34.43]Look, you need battery, bread, and milk.
[19:36.51]Batteries, bread, and milk.
[19:57.40]Because we all know the huge amount of nutritional value that bread has.
[20:04.42]Eating bread is like eating cotton candy.
[20:10.07]And milk is protein.
[20:13.07]And like vitamin D. So when you go to the store and you buy bread and milk, you're buying cotton candy, protein, and sunshine.
[20:24.45]Just go stand outside for like an hour.
[20:48.82]He's bald.
[20:49.50]What?
[20:50.00]I'm not.
[20:55.58]Have you ever eaten bread?
[21:01.05]Yeah, you know white bread is essentially just candy in your body.
[21:04.13]You know that, right?
[21:05.57]Come on.
[21:06.53]Hey, guess what bread was left on the shelf.
[21:11.81]The multigrain and wheat bread and stuff.
[21:13.85]Everyone just grabs all the fucking cotton candy bread and then runs out of the store screaming.
[21:18.93]All right, let's go.
[21:25.92]Yeah, sure, mom.
[21:27.12]We might control D6, but it's like a damn city down here.
[21:30.96]All the bunkers, the nooks and crannies and exits.
[21:34.12]Still, they basically order dream to find you.
[21:37.80]Multigrain is the one true bread.
[21:41.00]Oh, what do we got?
[21:42.04]Blackjack?
[22:00.21]I'll turn the game volume up one notch.
[22:03.57]Like that.
[22:03.95]Wheat bread and multigrain is really good.
[22:08.40]Yeah, but you walk into...
[22:14.08]You walk into 95% of every American household, they're gonna have, like, Wonder Bread on the shelf.
[22:20.50]Now it's too loud.
[22:21.46]What am I supposed to do?
[22:23.46]Alright, Goldilocks, calm down here.
[22:25.42]This is too soft.
[22:26.06]This is too loud.
[22:26.66]I can't put you guys in the correct bed.
[22:27.94]I'm sorry.
[22:28.54]I can't.
[22:29.12]It's gonna have to be a little softer.
[22:45.57]Machines with different wiring.
[22:49.29]But somehow you, Artyom, have the common wire.
[22:53.87]The connection with the dark ones.
[22:56.71]Yes, people died in this mission.
[23:00.65]I don't like this porridge.
[23:01.85]Hunter, the best of the order is most likely dead as well.
[23:06.55]And he taught you this.
[23:08.86]If we don't fight for our lives in this new world, we'll be devoured.
[23:14.59]Were you interrogating or no?
[23:17.48]But I would argue the old laws no longer apply.
[23:22.40]Hold on.
[23:25.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:28.54]I'll meet you halfway.
[23:29.20]Ready?
[23:29.92]Bingo.
[23:32.98]And then... No, I can't alt-tab.
[23:34.78]I was about to alt-tab and be very angry with myself.
[23:38.50]All right.
[23:39.84]And you, Khan.
[23:41.36]You have something to report?
[23:44.01]Yes, Colonel.
[23:45.45]Let's keep it short, then.
[23:47.55]I located the surviving... I don't have any more Dunkachino.
[23:50.54]What am I going to do?
[23:51.78]What?
[23:52.50]One of those things is still alive?
[23:54.64]Luckily, yes.
[23:56.85]I can't read any bits or anything either.
[23:58.49]God damn it.
[24:00.69]The Dark Ones were the greatest threat the Orders ever faced.
[24:04.23]Colonel, just give me a chance.
[24:06.57]A single Dark One is no threat.
[24:08.52]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[24:10.02]Artyom has a gift.
[24:12.16]I believe he can establish contact with the future.
[24:14.38]I just want to drink some more bread and Chino.
[24:17.32]All right.
[24:18.71]Artyom, go with Khan to the gardens and locate the Dark One.
[24:24.05]I'll send a sniper along.
[24:26.05]My best.
[24:27.07]Oh, quiet.
[24:28.51]Speaking of quiet, there she is.
[24:30.17]Why would we need a sniper?
[24:32.03]To eliminate the creature and finish the order's job.
[24:36.04]Miller, you can't.
[24:36.64]I thought that was her hair sweeping over to the left there.
[24:39.92]You idiot.
[24:40.68]You're making the same mistake that... We're done here.
[24:44.92]Escort Khan out of here.
[24:46.29]So it turns out he's the bad guy.
[24:47.93]Artyom, it's your last chance for forgiveness.
[24:50.73]For getting rid of the nightmares.
[24:53.26]That's Nolan North.
[24:54.28]It's Nolan North.
[24:55.00]Of course, he's in every game.
[24:56.78]Forget about Khan.
[24:58.56]Looks like he got close.
[25:00.10]Too close to the creature.
[25:01.56]Lost his mind.
[25:03.26]Look here, Artyom.
[25:04.77]Complete the mission.
[25:05.93]And get back here quickly.
[25:07.89]A war is coming.
[25:09.11]And I'll need every ranger at his post.
[25:12.09]On your way.
[25:13.31]So, what are you waiting for?
[25:15.69]Come along, rabbit.
[25:17.11]Okay.
[25:18.61]Artyom.
[25:19.95]No shit, that's not right.
[25:20.97]And don't forget to
[25:23.72]I forgot.
[25:24.18]No, sorry.
[25:24.54]I'm doing the David Hader snake.
[25:27.43]That's not correct.
[25:29.87]Quiet would not understand me if I talked like David Hader.
[25:32.19]I gotta talk like Kiefer Sutherland.
[25:33.51]Let me try.
[25:34.25]For her to be able to understand me.
[25:36.33]Let's see.
[25:36.61]Kiefer Sutherland.
[25:37.51]Okay.
[25:44.52]What?
[25:44.62]Nevermind.
[25:44.88]Watch out for the train!
[25:45.76]Watch out for the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[26:16.99]So where are we going?
[26:17.43]We gotta go headshot a monster?
[26:19.67]Well, we've worn this place out.
[26:21.55]Let's move.
[26:26.23]Oh, that's the green line.
[26:27.79]That's the orange line.
[26:31.37]A train to the past.
[26:32.69]Just a year ago, I stood on top of the TV tower.
[26:37.80]Not bad.
[26:39.74]What, a child?
[26:40.72]What?
[26:41.16]Come on.
[26:42.58]I got your back, don't worry.
[26:47.63]Me and my Duracell destroyer.
[26:50.23]In the past, trains were ordinary things.
[26:53.16]But now, this monorail seems magic, doesn't it?
[26:56.54]I got a controller sitting on it.
[26:57.46]Our kids won't know how to operate these things.
[27:00.22]And their kids will probably think this was built by the gods.
[27:03.46]The controller is... I don't want to use the controller.
[27:05.75]Sorry.
[27:06.99]All right, we've reached the station.
[27:08.91]This is the secret metro two line.
[27:10.45]We have to explore these tunnels.
[27:12.09]We can't spare the time of manpower.
[27:14.91]So don't wander off.
[27:17.39]Here we are.
[27:19.27]Let's see some monsters, huh?
[27:23.67]I'm trying too hard?
[27:26.19]That's all I do.
[27:27.63]I just try way too hard.
[27:28.91]That's my M.O., man.
[27:29.60]Oh, you know what?
[27:30.18]I think it's the complete opposite.
[27:46.37]Tryon.
[27:48.17]How am I reading chat?
[27:50.41]Because I can see.
[27:53.69]Don't use the battery gun, huh?
[27:55.27]That thing just came to my peripheral and it's gone instantly.
[28:01.17]See, that's my reaction time.
[28:02.54]You can fuck with my reaction times.
[28:04.16]You see how quick that was?
[28:05.22]Watch this.
[28:05.62]Ready?
[28:06.08]Oh, what's that?
[28:08.08]Ah, something like over here.
[28:08.90]I think that might be...
[28:11.70]That was just to scare it.
[28:14.03]I was just trying to scare the rat.
[28:15.03]Until I could sneak up and get it right in the ass.
[28:23.38]What was that?
[28:28.32]I wish there was a rat right there.
[28:29.44]You guys would have freaked out.
[28:33.65]No items on any of you guys?
[28:41.69]This lady's gonna die, right?
[28:43.35]Alright.
[28:43.97]The map shows a collector entry point ahead.
[28:46.07]Okay.
[28:52.82]Move.
[28:53.40]I'm following.
[28:53.98]I thought I was following you.
[28:55.84]Oh.
[28:59.25]I saw the hand over.
[29:08.12]Everyone was screaming at me.
[29:16.67]I think I missed them all.
[29:19.95]Why can I not move?
[29:20.61]What is going on?
[29:22.59]Here we go.
[29:23.28]Switch to Russian.
[29:35.30]Surface, put your mask on.
[29:39.96]You got it.
[29:40.36]Quit looking at my ass.
[29:50.53]It's way out of your reach, rabbit.
[29:54.57]Is she talking to me?
[29:59.46]Put the Russian audio on?
[30:00.92]I don't want to read subtitles.
[30:02.44]I have trouble enough playing the game as it is.
[30:09.96]Turn on the Russian voice.
[30:17.12]Give me a second.
[30:17.77]Hold on.
[30:23.35]This is nice.
[30:26.67]This is really, really well done.
[30:29.68]I saw the graphical comparison video between this and the original.
[30:32.19]Holy shit is it a huge difference.
[30:42.45]But I'm kind of lagging, though.
[30:44.51]I said that right now, and all of a sudden it's lagging.
[30:47.60]Look at this condensation.
[30:49.44]Okay.
[31:11.60]So stay in the open so so quiet can cover us sure thing I Know how funny would it be if she got up to right here and Slipped on moss or something and fell back and broke her neck and dead see that's the kind of game I would make So you just be dead right here, and you can just take the sniper rifle if you want.
[31:30.73]She was just cannon dead All right, so it begins
[31:42.59]There you are.
[31:43.11]There's the gargoyle again.
[31:44.93]Back for revenge.
[31:46.02]Can you snipe this?
[31:49.82]That's creepy.
[31:50.42]What do you mean, on the right?
[32:07.69]Why would you tell me on the right?
[32:11.06]I'm sitting there looking and she says on your right.
[32:17.28]You see where I'm looking, right?
[32:18.67]Yeah, on your right.
[32:23.21]Sorry, I meant left.
[32:24.15]I'm a trained military personnel.
[32:38.66]We good?
[32:40.06]We're good.
[32:47.53]She missed.
[32:49.61]Oh my god, you are bad!
[32:51.93]Look at, she's just missing over and over again.
[32:55.86]You are not good at this, lady.
[32:57.60]I thought you were supposed to be like the best sniper we have?
[33:00.04]We're in deep shit if that's the case.
[33:11.43]What?
[33:11.59]Alright, that was a fake out.
[33:16.01]My game is running like shit right now.
[33:22.84]There we go.
[33:25.88]What, the audio is de-synced?
[33:27.24]Shouldn't be.
[33:46.42]Alright, let's continue to move.
[33:55.44]Bad PC.
[33:56.80]Yeah, I like wish that was the case.
[34:01.31]I really do.
[34:07.83]This is Redux.
[34:08.61]And we're supposed to get a headshot on this thing, right?
[34:13.41]What are you talking about?
[34:14.79]What do you mean it's keeping me?
[34:18.98]He's standing still.
[34:26.36]Shoot it!
[34:28.78]What is- I- She's right- It's right there!
[34:40.61]Now you- We're never gonna kill this thing.
[34:42.99]Do I- Should I just shoot him?
[34:48.87]Let me show you how it's done.
[34:50.64]You want to go for all this finesse?
[34:51.76]Bullshit.
[34:52.38]I'll show you what to do.
[34:53.12]I got him.
[34:57.38]No, I didn't.
[34:59.10]There he is.
[35:09.45]What?
[35:09.93]Hey!
[35:14.69]What?
[35:20.23]I think I got him.
[35:21.75]I got him.
[35:26.69]Sorry, he's under control.
[35:28.96]The bad guys from District 9, whatever they are.
[35:32.44]Let's get a quick recap.
[35:57.05]They were the good guys.
[35:58.91]The aliens in District 9 were the good guys.
[36:04.67]Well, not like in the beginning of the movie, and that's the part when I fell asleep is when the humans became the bad guys.
[36:15.10]He just said good morning.
[36:15.96]We didn't even need to know Russian for that one. ...
[36:27.87]Captain of the Fuhrer, these prisoners were captured at the botanical gardens.
[36:32.35]Seems like they were looking for something.
[36:34.78]These two are rats.
[36:36.48]They refuse to speak.
[36:38.18]The third one looks like a ranger of the order.
[36:41.54]A mutant the size of a child was caught near him.
[36:45.08]It was delivered to Reich as well.
[36:47.72]I'll deal with it later.
[36:48.98]This one.
[36:50.65]Uh-oh, we're going to see some murders here, I think.
[36:53.25]No, no, I'm normal.
[36:54.05]See, two arms, two legs, ten fingers.
[36:56.67]Don't you understand?
[36:57.51]I'm a Hansa citizen.
[36:58.13]Why is this just District 9?
[36:59.31]Shut up.
[37:00.53]You're not in Hansa.
[37:02.03]Here, you are a suspect in the distribution of corrupted genes.
[37:06.09]And this is your trial.
[37:08.62]If your skull has the correct proportion, you are free to go.
[37:12.11]You got like bugs all over me?
[37:13.59]If not, you are an abomination.
[37:16.99]Science, you see.
[37:18.55]This is an outrage!
[37:20.41]I told you to stay still!
[37:22.29]Well, let's see.
[37:23.91]Why is he measuring his head?
[37:25.63]318 millimeters by 302.
[37:28.94]Let's look it up in detail.
[37:33.04]Ah, congratulations.
[37:34.46]You're a mutant.
[37:35.84]No, no.
[37:39.76]This is horrible.
[37:42.76]What was your mission in the gardens?
[37:45.62]Go to hell yourself.
[37:47.38]Nothing.
[37:48.54]Two.
[37:49.48]I'm gonna count to three.
[37:51.58]Mm-hmm.
[37:52.36]One.
[37:53.24]Lower into the red line.
[37:54.46]Two.
[37:54.78]Long-leaf covered musk fin.
[37:57.62]Three.
[37:59.02]Please.
[38:00.46]Please.
[38:00.78]I'll talk.
[38:01.82]I'll talk.
[38:02.68]But away from the other side.
[38:03.96]They'll kill me if they hear.
[38:05.58]Okay?
[38:06.78]Make this one to the second unit.
[38:10.38]Traitor!
[38:11.56]Alright.
[38:11.94]Oldest trick in the book.
[38:12.80]Nice.
[38:36.22]Oldest trick in the book.
[38:37.22]Yes, I'll talk.
[38:38.10]Please take off my bonds.
[38:41.14]And then I jump at you.
[38:42.06]Mm-hmm.
[38:59.86]You got it.
[39:01.44]Teamwork.
[39:01.84]I'm ready to go.
[39:03.23]Let's go down the garbage chute and find Chewie.
[39:06.53]Head down there.
[39:26.71]Do we not have flashlights anymore?
[39:27.91]Oh my god, it looks so fun.
[39:28.79]That's so much fun.
[39:29.29]That's awesome.
[39:50.32]I wish it was longer.
[39:51.04]I want my flashlight back, of all things.
[40:06.73]Okay.
[40:07.39]Go out of the way.
[40:08.33]I got this, move!
[40:09.19]Alright, here we go.
[40:09.63]Oh my goodness, people are just like, hanging around and... There's blood everywhere, this is fucking horrible.
[40:16.41]Jesus.
[40:34.44]Let's move!
[40:36.00]Stay out of the light and stick to the shadows.
[40:38.54]They are your best friend.
[40:46.51]Fuck this place.
[40:48.05]Okay, tap tap tap tap.
[40:49.69]Loose like we cleared it.
[40:52.23]Let's see, let's see.
[40:55.83]Great.
[40:59.11]I want to just throw a knife at that guy.
[41:01.87]Yeah, I gotta get up there.
[41:03.77]Dude, this is fucking terrible.
[41:29.07]Just give me like a throwing knife and let me just throw it into this guy's skull.
[41:35.85]I think I did it correct I did it correct Let me just get back up there
[42:05.40]We're good.
[42:05.72]Freezer, did you see that guy fall down?
[42:07.54]He made a loud noise.
[42:09.18]He's not gonna shovel this guy, is he?
[42:10.67]And won't.
[42:36.80]Oh, I so badly wanted to just get a knife on this guy's back.
[42:40.06]Why is he laughing?
[43:00.08]Can we leave?
[43:00.94]Why?
[43:03.09]When can we leave?
[43:07.61]What?
[43:10.39]Does he see us?
[43:14.15]He's staring at me right now.
[43:17.35]He's looking at both of us.
[43:20.18]Apparently he thought that was funny too There's a couple of guys crouching back here
[43:43.28]I will distract mine.
[43:44.52]Then you take yours down.
[43:45.66]Huh?
[43:46.98]Get to it.
[43:47.84]Don't start too soon.
[43:49.18]All I have is a knife.
[43:50.02]Let's do it.
[43:58.25]All right.
[43:58.53]I gotta wait for him to do him, right?
[44:00.77]What's he got?
[44:02.96]What did he just do?
[44:05.45]Okay, you ready?
[44:08.69]This is on him, man.
[44:12.83]I got a clear shot with the neck for the knife.
[44:14.23]He has to shoot that guy.
[44:17.27]Shoot him.
[44:19.50]Shoot that guy.
[44:21.56]Well, I did my job.
[44:25.12]You gonna do yours?
[44:34.60]Good.
[44:35.36]Nice work.
[44:35.76]Alright, open.
[44:36.20]How do you open the gates?
[44:37.34]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[44:38.94]Going for it.
[44:39.44]I'm right here, okay.
[44:59.09]We're going to see the silhouettes all die here.
[45:00.33]No, I got to get in a good spot.
[45:04.55]What happened?
[45:06.23]What happened?
[45:07.71]Who saw me?
[45:09.98]Wait, what?
[45:22.85]I didn't realize we were going up anymore.
[45:25.77]I didn't know we were going up anymore.
[45:27.10]Alright, I got it.
[45:27.74]Don't worry.
[45:28.78]Everything's going to be fine.
[45:30.10]There we go.
[45:30.52]Hold on.
[45:30.74]How did he die?
[45:31.38]Why did that guy at the cross fall down?
[45:53.53]Alright, I know I got you.
[45:56.44]Okay, there's a guy over there.
[45:59.64]Alright, so where is he going?
[46:10.75]He's taking out... Okay, I had to wait for him to do that.
[46:12.81]I'm eventually going to have to sneak up behind this guy.
[46:21.40]You go to that side.
[46:22.50]Maybe there you will be able to climb up.
[46:24.14]Okay.
[46:24.66]Let's meet on the top.
[46:26.36]Hey, Spartan!
[46:28.74]Break a leg.
[46:29.44]That's not appropriate for right here.
[46:31.90]I'm not about to go... I'm not about to go do, like, a theater production of Beauty and the Beast.
[46:42.97]Okay, shit.
[46:52.78]What is this?
[46:53.32]I guess I'm going in here.
[46:55.08]Jump off so you actually break a leg.
[47:05.82]That would be painful.
[47:08.54]Save them.
[47:09.10]That's what I'm gonna do.
[47:11.62]Should I just start, like, Donkey Kong Pound hammering this?
[47:13.31]And fall through?
[47:32.29]I could jump down there and do a rogue one.
[47:35.95]Chirru Imwe and just start like... Oh my god.
[47:40.01]There are the knives I wanted.
[47:52.47]Who?
[47:54.37]Chimwe Imwe.
[47:56.69]Chimru Imwe.
[47:57.47]What's his name?
[47:57.91]What's the guy's name?
[48:06.35]You guys have seen Rogue One.
[48:07.29]What's his name there?
[48:09.67]Wow.
[48:11.02]Huh?
[48:11.68]Is he going to break through?
[48:13.52]Oh, look at that.
[48:21.87]Oh, shit.
[48:22.27]Okay.
[48:22.51]I don't have a light.
[48:24.77]Okay.
[48:33.54]What?
[48:35.50]Give me a break!
[48:37.36]What?
[48:41.06]No!
[48:43.86]Why?
[48:52.25]Dead with pixels to the left and right of his head.
[48:55.49]Give me a break.
[48:56.70]Holy goodness gracious.
[49:00.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:14.14]That's what I wanted to do.
[49:17.32]I thought we had it bad.
[49:18.54]Shh.
[49:18.76]Shh.
[49:19.04]Shh.
[49:19.16]Shh.
[49:19.26]Shh.
[49:19.92]Shh.
[49:20.21]Shh.
[49:20.33]Shh.

[49:21.71]Shh.
[49:44.60]I ain't gonna do that anymore.
[49:45.66]I ain't gonna do that anymore.
[49:47.44]I don't know what killed him, but... I don't know what killed... I'm not gonna try that anymore.
[49:53.30]I was trying to go... I was trying to, like... I was gonna do a thing where I hit it the first try, and I was gonna just turn to the chat and be like, What?
[50:00.44]What now?
[50:00.90]What now?
[50:01.26]It was a joke, and... I thought we had it bad.
[50:09.29]Okay, let's just go.
[50:11.51]They'll guess us if they hear you now.
[50:15.21]Is there only one guy here?
[50:16.83]There's just this one dude.
[50:20.27]Oh, he killed him.
[50:21.19]I got it.
[50:21.47]Alright, anywhere, um... Open the airlock.
[50:24.13]Hello?
[50:24.31]Hide.
[50:24.45]Hide.
[50:45.23]I'm hiding in such plain sight right now.
[50:47.65]How do I get in there?
[50:50.07]Shoot him.
[50:53.33]Headshot.
[50:53.81]Oh, hell.
[50:54.29]How do I open the... How do I...
[51:17.84]I thought I was supposed to open the gate.
[51:20.12]Open the cells.
[51:21.72]There we go.
[51:23.21]Now I'm gonna be useful.
[51:29.82]No flashlight come on pump this thing up You got it
[52:00.47]Make sure you cover me.
[52:01.67]That's a light that needs to be turned off.
[52:04.77]I don't want to let this guy know where I am.
[52:12.55]I think I have a new ability in this game.
[52:14.67]As long as I look at somebody long enough, I think I can give him a heart attack.
[52:17.29]I have a heart attack vision.
[52:18.23]That's pretty cool.
[52:20.16]Let's try it on him.
[52:23.54]It seems like four or five seconds with my heart attack ray.
[52:29.90]No, I think this guy's not in line of sight.
[52:31.36]This guy is though.
[52:37.06]No, he's not in line of sight.
[52:40.60]That's alright.
[52:42.08]Somebody else is... to the left.
[53:08.14]It seems like I'm going to pull the alarm now.
[53:11.40]I didn't know that other guy was even there.
[53:15.54]If you saw somebody die next to you and you were guarding a place, why would you stand there for 15 seconds and go, hmm, it's possible there's a bad guy in here.
[53:26.45]Maybe I should put the alarm... Oh, I'm going to turn the alarm on.
[53:34.30]What are you talking?
[53:35.52]What the fuck are you talking about?
[53:37.74]Those weren't in the head?
[53:38.50]Give me a fucking break.
[54:04.86]You killed that guy.
[54:05.90]Shoot that guy.
[54:11.72]He didn't see me.
[54:12.36]He saw the other guy.
[54:14.28]He saw him.
[54:15.32]He did the thing I do.
[54:18.05]Hold on.
[54:18.47]Wait.
[54:18.81]I didn't get spotted.
[54:19.59]He did.
[54:20.13]He got spotted.
[54:21.97]When you're visible, huh?
[54:23.89]Alright.
[54:24.13]There's bound to be more guards further ahead, but they won't be able to use gas.
[54:27.59]We can really let ourselves go.
[54:28.73]Ah.
[54:28.81]I wish I had a grenade.
[54:30.99]I'll break through even without one.
[54:36.47]Alright, let's do this right.
[54:44.99]Can I go up there?
[54:57.45]I think I'm just gonna go up there.
[55:02.13]Who's screaming?
[55:09.63]Alright, where's my friend?
[55:10.63]Did he already go?
[55:12.27]He's right there.
[55:12.93]I'm gonna just wait for him to go over here.
[55:15.91]Yeah.
[55:16.15]Alright, which one are you gonna shoot?
[55:21.65]Because... If I shoot this guy... Okay, I guess that's fine.
[55:34.26]Where's my friend?
[55:39.88]There's two guys over there, one guy over here.
[55:44.85]I think I can go down though.
[55:56.17]Is it just two there?
[55:57.87]I could get rid of the two if it's just two.
[56:04.92]What is this other dude?
[56:06.54]Oh, Jesus!
[56:14.58]I just Batman'd that guy.
[56:15.54]That was a pretty perfect Batman.
[56:17.09]I'm gonna wait till he comes in this room and I'm gonna stab him.
[56:20.73]Just need to chill for a second.
[56:27.63]See, I wish I could hear him.
[56:44.83]I could do 1, 2, 3.
[56:45.73]You think I can do a 1, 2, 3?
[56:47.71]It's a risky move, but I think... No, never mind.
[56:49.45]I'm not going to do it.
[56:53.58]Here he comes.
[56:55.56]Oh, come on.
[56:56.46]No.
[56:58.34]I got too curious.
[57:07.16]It was just his imagination.
[57:10.66]You're using too many coloring books.
[57:22.98]What's going on?
[57:23.48]It was the body.
[57:45.59]It was the body.
[57:48.21]Okay.
[57:52.91]Hey, well, we got them all.
[57:53.83]That was fun.
[57:59.08]I wish that my screen wasn't flashing red.
[58:00.98]Turn it off.
[58:01.70]Okay, take a look on the other side.
[58:04.20]There should be a switch just like this one.
[58:07.83]Yeah, there is.
[58:08.87]Push it.
[58:26.56]Okay, enough with the sightseeing.
[58:31.44]You've got to get out before the rain.
[58:33.60]Let's move, Piet.
[58:35.58]Let's give me a cutscene.
[58:41.12]My escape from the Nazi prison could be entitled, The Enemy of My Enemy Is My Friend.
[58:49.17]So, how are you, chihuahua?
[58:51.23]All right?
[58:53.15]You are tough, huh?
[58:54.27]No wonder they made you a ranger.
[59:01.06]Follow me.
[59:01.52]Don't stop.
[59:02.74]Right.
[59:07.86]Fortune has smiled upon us.
[59:13.36]Our scouts have located a real treasure trove.
[59:17.07]A legendary D6 bunker complex.
[59:20.69]Huge storage facilities filled with supplies.
[59:24.55]There is medicine and enough camphor to sustain the Reich for a hundred years, and enough weapons for us to wipe the freaks and genetically impure from the face of the Earth.
[59:35.90]What's wrong with that?
[59:36.72]Fire!
[59:37.06]Fire!
[59:37.22]Fire!
[59:37.84]Majority, make way!
[59:45.42]I'm just, like, not into it.
[59:46.78]I'm not going to lie.
[59:49.57]I'm not into it tonight.
[59:51.97]I don't want to lie to you guys.
[60:07.87]We must prepare for a great war!
[60:11.43]The final war!
[60:13.55]And it will end with the triumph of our eyes!
[60:17.67]The mailed fist of the legions of Reich will pursue the Fuhrer?
[60:22.88]What do you want?
[60:24.98]Please go save the First... What the hell are you doing here then?
[60:28.16]Go get them!
[60:34.63]Why'd you do that?
[60:38.13]Whoops, you bumped into the wall.
[60:39.65]Alright, let's go, let's go.
[60:44.96]Let me like shake off these annoying bugs that I have right now.
[60:47.94]He's trying to stab the guy in the face.
[60:58.56]Over here!
[60:59.64]Over here!
[61:00.48]Over here!
[61:01.46]Over here!
[61:03.96]Over here!
[61:05.70]Over here!
[61:06.62]Over here!
[61:07.46]Over here!
[61:26.50]I'm just like, I'm like, checked out.
[61:28.82]I'm in another dimension.
[61:30.60]I don't even fuck, you know what I mean?
[61:32.16]You know, sometimes, let me just tell you something.
[61:34.24]When you're, I am so checked out right now.
[61:37.76]I wish I wasn't, but I am, and I can't lie.
[61:41.04]Well, I'm not gonna lie to you guys.
[61:43.80]I'm just so checked out.
[61:54.75]Do I need a break?
[61:55.25]No, no, I'm just... I don't even have the guns.
[61:56.45]I didn't even get the guns.
[61:58.65]It's alright, I'll get guns later.
[62:31.74]I have a pistol.
[62:32.76]Why wouldn't he see through me?
[62:56.07]Isn't there, like, an easier way to do that?
[63:01.41]No chance for the good ending anymore.
[63:03.79]Alright, let's go.
[63:10.08]Why did I kill him?
[63:10.82]I don't know, because we were being attacked.
[63:14.40]Alright.
[63:15.14]I need to be looking for items now, right?
[63:27.19]Or not quite, not yet.
[63:31.75]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[63:44.18]He just got captured instantly.
[63:45.86]What, were they waiting in the tube for him?
[63:47.48]Oh, God.
[63:58.86]Okay.
[64:02.29]Well, apparently.
[64:05.77]Oh, shit.
[64:07.81]That's opening.
[64:12.03]Now we got one, two.
[64:12.83]Hopefully they don't see me like this.
[64:16.79]They're gonna eventually come in here?
[64:23.06]I hope so.
[64:39.31]I can get one in the head and then one in the body.
[64:44.69]Oh god, all the rocks just fell.
[64:45.95]Why did all the rocks fall?
[64:47.33]Actually, perfect spot.
[64:55.25]That was giving me a good opportunity.
[65:04.47]Need more.
[65:05.01]No, it's just these two.
[65:07.78]Scoop up the stuff.
[65:12.06]Now.
[65:12.26]Let's go over here.
[65:16.00]Uh... There's a giant... Oh, there's a guy up there.
[65:18.74]There's a guy in there.
[65:20.40]What happens if I kill this guy?
[65:28.33]Oh, that happens.
[65:28.99]The guy was just working.
[65:30.19]Oh, man.
[65:51.16]They didn't pull the alarm yet.
[65:52.08]I think I'm good.
[65:56.82]He's just telling... Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me it all.
[66:10.20]All quick, quick, quick.
[66:10.86]Go, go, go.
[66:11.14]What the...
[66:23.67]Oh, no.
[66:24.59]I really do have... I can't just run around and be a dickhead.
[66:26.83]I have to stealth this whole thing, huh?
[66:34.85]I actually have to stealth the whole thing.
[66:36.73]All right.
[66:49.66]Stay out of the light.
[66:51.04]I want their items though.
[66:51.82]Don't look over here at the guy that's shooting.
[67:23.72]Alright, there we go.
[67:31.02]Can I turn this light off here?
[67:34.34]Yeah.
[67:35.72]Alright, so this dude is working.
[67:37.22]I don't think there's anybody to the left, but I need to sneak around in the building over there.
[67:50.09]It's gonna wrap around...
[67:53.83]There's a guy in the building in the bottom, I think.
[67:55.88]Isn't there?
[67:56.20]I wonder if I'm going to get seen if I, like, shoot the light.
[68:10.20]Yeah, but if I shoot the light, isn't that going to make everybody freak out?
[68:13.74]Jesus.
[68:14.36]There's a guy standing right there smoking.
[68:16.04]A guy just smoking right there.
[68:25.24]I have to kill that guy.
[68:26.14]I gotta wait till he comes around.
[68:34.59]Well.
[68:40.21]Shit, did somebody see that?
[68:41.39]Are you kidding me?
[68:46.70]Here comes the alarm.
[68:51.02]Well, I guess not.
[68:59.37]The throwing knives have like a super power.
[69:02.33]Where if you hit somebody with them, then nobody knows.
[69:04.39]Just go left.
[69:19.00]Well, they know where I am.
[69:21.20]They can't hit me when I'm a fucking like Nightcrawler!
[69:34.21]Alright, I'm gonna go left.
[69:34.93]Roger.
[69:39.19]Checking that.
[69:40.03]Over.
[69:40.21]So I'm just gonna go around the left side.
[69:43.69]And I'm gonna shoot the light and see what happens.
[69:53.32]This is a fucking mess.
[69:55.26]A communist rat found in our tunnels.
[69:57.80]It's not the one.
[70:02.23]Did I just get so impatient that I blew that whole thing?
[70:05.05]No.
[70:10.68]Does this thing have no ammo?
[70:21.56]Alright, turn this shit off.
[70:25.40]What did that guy just jump out for?
[70:27.02]Oh, did they hear me walking?
[70:29.08]He heard me walking, I think.
[70:32.49]What did he hear?
[70:33.19]What did he see?
[70:33.85]I heard my footprints.
[70:41.85]He could hear my footprints.
[70:42.91]Alright, am I crazy or is this way more sensitive than 2033 was?
[71:03.88]They're going to come over here.
[71:12.98]It's way easier.
[71:13.80]I didn't have very much difficulty with this shit at all.
[71:17.86]On the same difficulty.
[71:26.66]This is the less sensitive one?
[71:28.08]How did I not have this much trouble on the last one?
[71:41.63]Let me just take the guy's picture, please.
[71:43.59]Thank you.
[71:54.28]This guy was so desperate to show me his moves.
[71:58.22]Let's see if I can just get through this.
[72:00.42]Let me just get through this, up the stairs.
[72:03.09]That guy accidentally just fell down and shot me.
[72:05.13]I didn't even mean to.
[72:44.23]Just let me get through this area.
[72:47.65]Can I please put my light on?
[72:48.67]Can I please heal?
[72:49.51]Turn off that lantern.
[72:51.86]I don't want it.
[72:52.32]Oh, great.
[72:53.16]I can hear them screaming.
[72:54.08]What is this?
[73:14.08]I'm using the military the high-quality rounds do Oh Man all the way back here Why does I just don't think I have it today guys like any brain capacity at all I'm so focused on my internet not working that I like forgot like to like eat food and drink a coffee.
[73:38.15]Oh
[74:04.90]This game is like good too.
[74:07.19]I'm just not mentally here right now at all.
[74:15.15]And I'm playing on the you die in two bullets mode.
[74:24.89]I'm gonna give it one last decent try.
[74:26.81]Alright.
[74:30.66]Back to parking lot tycoon.
[74:32.86]Go back to parking lot carnival.
[74:57.81]I want to get away from this guy, because I don't want to hear... Don't hear my footsteps.
[75:02.17]What if I just don't kill anybody at all?
[75:03.36]What if I just go to the left and just hide?
[75:11.26]How far down does it go?
[75:12.18]I don't even know.
[75:13.20]Is this guy going to see me?
[75:16.99]I feel like I need to kill that guy on the right and then go to the left.
[75:22.73]Just don't miss this.
[75:25.34]Like, you know what I'm saying?
[75:26.90]Do you understand what I'm saying here?
[75:29.96]Like, do you understand?
[75:31.78]Like, how is it possible that that guy, that didn't get hit by one of those?
[75:36.02]It's not, it doesn't seem like it's even real.
[75:38.37]Doesn't seem like that could even, I just don't have it at all.
[75:41.11]It wasn't meant to be.
[75:41.95]Look at all my knives.
[76:08.77]I'm just gonna go over here.
[76:14.35]Did I make a sound?
[76:18.85]Uh, no, I think they found the dead guy.
[76:22.83]No, he said it's all clear.
[76:24.53]There's a guy in the window, though.
[76:30.98]Don't turn around.
[76:40.03]I think I'm severely overestimating how far they can see.
[76:56.03]Did you have to say bitch?
[76:57.41]Did you have to yell bitch before you died?
[76:59.69]Did you have to do that?
[77:04.25]Oh come on, no!
[77:05.99]The guy screams bitch and that's why I'm gonna lose.
[77:14.55]I'm not entirely sure.
[77:15.67]At least I don't know where I am.
[77:27.98]I think I can go up and around and jump over that.
[77:29.48]I'm gonna go up the stairs, I think.
[77:50.49]Shit.
[77:59.87]I don't know about this.
[78:03.57]They killed each other, it's fine.
[78:05.89]I thought you were the last one in here, man.
[78:07.83]I really didn't think you were in here.
[78:09.03]Oh my god.
[78:10.81]Alright, I can't.
[78:12.88]I can't do it.
[78:13.60]I gotta get out.
[78:16.03]I gotta get out of that game.
[78:16.89]I just don't have the mental capacity to play video games right now.
[78:21.57]Apparently, over the last, like, two hours.
[78:27.12]No, it's because of the fucking snowstorm.
[78:29.04]Not eating the coal.
[78:29.88]I don't know what it is.
[78:30.92]But I ain't gonna fucking torture myself or you guys anymore.
[78:36.41]Let's do something else.
[78:46.67]What can I do for like an hour or so?
[78:48.21]Let me see.
[78:53.22]Not eating enough bread and milk.
[78:57.06]Hey, there's one.
[78:59.28]The silver lining here is the internet did not die.
[79:01.64]So that is a plus.
[79:16.39]Yeah, let me... Hold on, give me one second.
[79:20.31]Let me just plug in.
[79:21.17]Is it plugged in?
[79:22.65]I don't think it is.
[79:23.21]I'm just going to put on IRL and just chill for like an hour or so.
[79:35.41]You know that feeling?
[79:36.53]I'm going to give you guys a feeling.
[79:40.10]When you're just like just fucking annoyed by everything.
[79:44.42]You guys ever get there?
[79:45.56]Like, I'm there right now.
[79:47.08]You know what I mean?
[79:50.96]I'm just like, everything's annoying.
[79:52.12]I'm just annoyed.
[79:53.24]I'm mentally just, like, pissy.
[79:56.38]You know what I mean?
[79:57.08]I don't want to be there.
[79:58.34]But I am.
[80:01.80]I don't want to be, like, a pissy little shit on stream.
[80:06.76]Let's plug this in.
[80:14.50]What is this plugged into?
[80:22.15]Oh, I still haven't gotten a haircut either.
[80:25.61]I can't wait to just shave my head.
[80:28.39]It'll be fun.
[80:33.56]And did that work?
[80:36.36]We'll find out in a second.
[80:38.83]We'll find out in one second.
[80:40.46]No, hold on.
[80:41.68]Let me just, let me just, let me just, let me just, you know, let me just.
[80:45.13]See you guys in a second.
