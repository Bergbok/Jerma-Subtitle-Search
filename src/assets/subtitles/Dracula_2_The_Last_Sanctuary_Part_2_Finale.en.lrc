[ve:61.1.100]

[00:07.26]How's it going?
[00:10.40]I looked over and saw people saying there was a beep.
[00:11.84]I think it was the special cargo notification in the game.
[00:20.11]The last few of these chips in my mouth.
[00:22.69]And you know, I think we're just going to go to Dracula.
[00:25.81]I did Boston to LA.
[00:27.67]It was fun.
[00:29.57]And I feel like I'm going back to Dallas now.
[00:32.96]I made 10 grand.
[00:34.88]I got the $10,000 reward for going to LA.
[00:39.54]So we're going to move to Dracula.
[00:41.52]Dracula 2.
[00:42.98]The second half of this playthrough of the game.
[00:50.73]I'm interested in definitely doing it for real though.
[00:55.97]And it was really cool to see that the devs were here.
[00:58.33]They dropped a few codes so hopefully some people got them.
[01:03.01]Give me one more second and I will put on Dracula 2.
[01:43.25]Alright, so let's just get rid of this.
[01:47.99]And then I got to capture my screen again.
[01:49.73]Dracula 2 is crazy.
[01:53.42]It takes over your whole computer.
[01:57.44]But that's to be expected.
[01:58.50]It's an old game, so it's fine.
[01:59.60]Alright, what title?
[02:07.41]I think the title is fine.
[02:09.62]It's technically still correct.
[02:12.28]We don't need to mention that there was a truck game before.
[02:14.65]We can just say that we drove a truck to the game.
[02:17.01]Okay.
[02:17.15]And this.
[02:27.51]And this.
[02:33.09]This.
[02:39.99]and let me turn it up a little bit because this game is not as uh it's a little bit quieter than the other one I think it's right there should be good let me know if it's too bad and we can start it over alright here we go so adjust your volume it might be a little loud just let you know how is it is good
[03:17.05]Sounds fine.
[03:17.41]Alright.
[03:19.09]So a couple of days ago, we were trying to get the antenna to work to get rid of the rats.
[03:31.26]I believe it was this one here, right?
[03:36.56]Because then I opened up the sewer.
[03:49.81]Okay, so now where do I go from here?
[03:52.51]I think we just keep going.
[03:59.40]Yeah, because this is the... Alright, so this gave us this.
[04:04.52]Now I can leave, I think.
[04:11.42]I got the ladder.
[04:12.18]I gotta try to remember what I just did.
[04:13.62]Do I even have the ladder?
[04:17.20]Is the ladder even there?
[04:17.92]I can't tell.
[04:27.45]change the category?
[04:28.81]Oh, shit.
[04:30.19]Can one of the mods change it to Dracula 2?
[04:31.88]The Lost Sanctuary?
[04:35.42]You're supposed to have wooden boards.
[04:39.84]I need to go back to Carfax.
[04:42.24]Alright, so... How do I get out of here?
[04:51.65]Wasn't I stuck down here?
[04:53.17]And that was one of the scary things of being stuck down here is I don't know where to go.
[05:01.19]Oh, I can't leave.
[05:01.75]Is there a way to get out?
[05:14.42]No other person is streaming this game right now.
[05:16.48]I mean, it's a 25 year old game.
[05:33.11]Wait, it's the, it's, oh.
[05:36.64]Got him.
[05:36.86]Alright, I got the boards.
[05:39.68]Place the boards right here.
[05:41.04]Let's do it.
[05:42.72]That was loud, but not as bad as it could have been.
[05:48.42]Are those boards gone forever?
[05:49.42]Okay, I made it.
[06:01.17]Now I got to go back to Carfax.
[06:06.62]Which is, how do I get out of here?
[06:07.66]So we need to go back to Carfax to use the rat machine.
[06:18.55]Can I just walk out the front door?
[06:26.39]I think you entirely skipped those parts.
[06:28.71]Really?
[06:29.03]So, so what, where do I, where do I go now?
[06:35.59]Back into the Dracula sanctuary.
[06:37.45]Oh, wait, I could go in there now.
[06:38.65]Because remember I pressed the eyeballs and he said, no, you cannot do this.
[06:44.76]This is my sanctuary.
[06:46.86]Where was that?
[07:02.62]There it is.
[07:04.18]Okay.
[07:04.58]So I can go in here.
[07:16.36]Huh?
[07:21.26]That's the face I just made to this information.
[07:23.51]I don't understand what, what?
[07:28.70]So use the new antenna machine on... Wait, I can actually use it now.
[07:59.41]Where are they?
[08:04.81]It actually works now.
[08:08.58]I must have had to power it up there.
[08:15.22]Where were those gargoyles?
[08:19.92]Are they just scattered around here?
[08:31.62]Or do I just bring them back down to the rats?
[08:38.36]Because it says, yeah, it says... I need to use this on these three... Okay, so I have to find the wolf, the bird, and the... lion or whatever, goat or something.
[09:00.92]No?
[09:01.36]Okay, wait.
[09:02.80]Up here?
[09:06.51]That's kind of a wolf, isn't it?
[09:07.43]Isn't that a wolf?
[09:10.13]That's a wolf right there.
[09:23.70]Dracula 2 has more viewers than Elden Ring.
[09:29.61]Well, I...
[09:35.64]How come you have a scope?
[09:38.04]Alright.
[09:38.68]Where is that?
[09:39.26]I got to find these gargoyle heads.
[09:43.69]There's one.
[09:44.07]Okay.
[09:44.83]Got it.
[09:45.05]Okay.
[09:46.87]Now, wait.
[09:47.73]Now what?
[09:50.11]What is that?
[09:50.37]What do I do?
[09:52.43]This thing's at nine?
[09:55.28]Okay.
[09:55.84]I don't get it.
[10:10.43]I bring it to the... At least I know what that one is.
[10:22.46]Maybe just do it to them all?
[10:34.93]Match the signal and get it to broadcast mode.
[10:37.61]Alright.
[10:39.31]This device is the strangest, hardest part of this whole fucking franchise.
[10:43.98]Alright, it's that one right there.
[10:45.30]Okay, there's another one.
[10:56.47]This is set to six now.
[11:06.90]What frequency do I need to do?
[11:10.70]That was 96.
[11:11.20]And then.
[11:14.82]I guess just find out what the other frequency is.
[11:18.06]Maybe put it on 6 now.
[11:31.21]OK.
[11:31.29]What did I just?
[11:33.51]What the fuck was that in the chat?
[11:34.71]Was it like a dick?
[11:36.95]That was weird.
[11:38.61]Alright, now broadcast it.
[11:45.56]What?
[11:46.90]Uh, my game crashed.
[11:48.10]Nope.
[11:51.28]Ah, alright, that's what you do.
[11:54.36]Yep.
[11:54.94]Alright, so I do that to all of them?
[12:03.17]Where's the bird?
[12:03.77]Bird was back here.
[12:07.61]Okay, so this was nine.
[12:17.63]Got it.
[12:23.51]Is Chaos Crystal alive?
[12:24.71]Yep.
[12:26.25]Almost died a couple days ago, but he's doing just fine.
[12:34.91]I'm very, very slowly leveling up.
[12:37.63]I think I'm level, I spell level 20.
[12:39.85]I've gained three levels in a week.
[12:42.57]And the last one was, what was it?
[12:51.74]It was a, I got the wolf, I got the bird and there was something else.
[12:55.28]Is it that?
[13:09.23]At least I have it out.
[13:17.22]Did you get this game from Redbox?
[13:20.98]Did Redbox do games?
[13:33.95]They did.
[13:34.45]That's interesting.
[13:38.50]Uh, it's the dead guy.
[13:39.22]He doesn't have a head anymore.
[13:41.80]His head's gone.
[13:42.92]Come on, where are you?
[13:49.22]What am I looking for again?
[13:50.02]Let me see what it looks like.
[13:54.65]It is the wolf head.
[13:56.35]Isn't that the one I was just looking at?
[13:58.51]The one that's, yeah, up here.
[13:59.45]No?
[14:05.25]No way, right?
[14:10.23]There's no way.
[14:10.71]That is a wolf head.
[14:11.81]Do I have to do it next to his head?
[14:26.78]Wait.
[14:29.29]What is... Something like this dog's butt?
[14:36.37]Oh, no, no, no.
[14:37.25]Okay, oops.
[14:37.49]Oops.
[14:43.91]Apparently there's another wolf head somewhere.
[14:45.55]It's not that one.
[14:55.40]Shit, where is this thing?
[15:04.72]Where are you?
[15:05.36]I already got this one.
[15:12.39]Is it that?
[15:27.06]What?
[15:30.70]How would I have ever found that without accidentally just doing that?
[15:33.43]Alright, four.
[15:42.23]Do it.
[15:48.43]All three of them.
[15:52.68]Okay, now I should... Can I go in?
[15:56.76]This is probably the final chapter of the game coming up here.
[16:16.96]Who's that?
[16:20.62]This is a crunchy room.
[16:21.84]This room has static on it.
[16:35.89]one oh god four digits okay anything on this guy try one two three four that'd be awesome if this actually worked wait
[17:11.15]Do I have four numbers somewhere?
[17:15.99]I didn't.
[17:16.59]I never even had to do this.
[17:17.59]We spent so much time two days ago desperately trying to figure this out.
[17:31.94]Did that.
[17:34.48]I don't think I did.
[17:35.22]Did I do this?
[17:35.84]It hurts.
[17:41.99]A, 4, 2, 6, 7, H, 3, 9.
[17:52.20]Okay.
[17:53.40]G. That is it.
[17:55.39]Alright.
[17:55.79]So, H. So, B, H, D, F. Uh.
[18:02.43]A, 4.
[18:04.69]Wait, where's B?
[18:05.92]B.
[18:10.75]B, where's B?
[18:11.55]B, would it be six?
[18:12.73]The number right next to it?
[18:14.84]Or is this a different number that's corresponding to something else?
[18:17.78]B is also a kind of a crescent moon.
[18:27.22]There was a moon face?
[18:28.10]Yeah.
[18:28.32]Alright, so it's half moon.
[18:32.33]So what does half moon mean?
[18:33.47]Half moon means what?
[18:51.48]B-H-D-F.
[18:53.66]How would I know?
[18:58.82]B-H-D-F.
[19:05.16]This is the Wisp from Warcraft.
[19:08.46]Holy shit, it really is.
[19:10.26]That is the Wisp.
[19:14.57]Now all I have to do is the tree sound.
[19:24.26]Your building is complete.
[19:32.10]What does the triad say?
[19:33.06]For the wild.
[19:39.62]Okay, this is... I'm gonna try this.
[19:40.92]Let's do B. I'm gonna do... 9.
[19:44.02]Let's do the one before it.
[19:44.88]So 9... with H.
[19:45.50]9, 7... with D.
[19:49.28]9, 7, 2... F.
[19:49.38]9, 7, 2... 6.
[19:49.54]See if that works.
[20:10.92]Nine.
[20:12.60]Seven.
[20:14.39]Two.
[20:14.73]Fuck you.
[20:16.67]Stop it.
[20:19.53]Six.
[20:20.35]Oh my god.
[20:26.00]Done.
[20:27.62]Shit.
[20:30.38]Nah, you had it right.
[20:31.14]Nine, two, six, seven.
[20:32.72]Oh, did I just flip him?
[20:43.25]The moons probably have something to do with it.
[21:06.44]Maybe it's the ones after it?
[21:07.80]So D, F, where's D?
[21:11.71]9 7 2 3?
[21:12.05]9 7 2 3?
[21:17.89]9 4 2 6 corresponds with the moon.
[21:27.21]That's what I thought I did.
[21:30.27]I didn't.
[21:30.61]I did.
[21:30.77]No, I did 9 7.
[21:31.41]Okay.
[21:33.55]Do you need help?
[21:33.93]You can solve these puzzles faster if you let me make you a pair of puzzle-suffing sh- puzzle-suffing shoes.
[21:42.83]9-4-2-6 yeah that's correct shit wait is there like a confirm that I'm not doing?
[22:01.52]that's not it
[22:12.39]9278.
[22:12.45]So wait, is that what it is?
[22:19.97]Did you have to use the corresponding with the moon?
[22:23.21]I'm just saying words to make it sound like I knew what I was talking about.
[22:26.31]Oh my god.
[22:28.81]Come on, dude.
[22:29.69]There you are.
[22:30.19]9278.
[22:30.21]9728.
[22:31.29]Yes.
[22:31.49]Yes.
[22:47.07]9782?
[22:54.46]I would, okay, I would solve this one on my own, but looking at the green night vision gives me a headache.
[23:01.74]I got it pretty much.
[23:02.36]9728?
[23:11.73]Maybe there's a button I'm not pressing.
[23:12.77]Like you have to press his mouth or his nose or his head?
[23:21.64]9278.
[23:21.70]This person said, I'm begging you.
[23:30.75]Got it.
[23:32.55]I had it right.
[23:33.17]I just, I didn't want to look at that green shit.
[23:36.09]I did the 9782972.
[23:36.47]I did it.
[23:36.93]You want those shoes?
[23:37.75]Nah, I'm good.
[23:38.31]I can do it.
[23:56.88]Cool.
[23:57.02]Alright.
[23:57.60]Excellent.
[24:03.92]Your determination is of no avail.
[24:07.44]Whatever happens, I cannot lose.
[24:09.88]Do you hear?
[24:11.80]But you cannot win either.
[24:13.87]Let Mina go.
[24:14.61]Let's close the door.
[24:16.55]Can a chess player carry on the game without his queen?
[24:20.61]Only a fool would believe that.
[24:25.76]How did I end up in here?
[24:26.48]That's the kind of way you call somebody for dinner.
[24:48.14]Once again, I am on my way to Transylvania, and I have the feeling that this will be the last time I make this journey.
[24:55.73]Either I shall succeed in finding Mina and overcome Dracula, or I shall die in the attempt.
[25:03.07]What kind of world am I going to find there?
[25:06.03]Shall I meet Dorco the Witch again?
[25:07.66]Did I beat it?
[25:08.72]I can still remember how powerless I felt when she shut Mina and I in the castle attic to hand us over to Dracula.
[25:16.58]even though I had risked my life to restore her powers.
[25:20.62]But when I arrive, will I have a choice of allies?
[25:25.95]I remember what Dracula said at the sticks.
[25:28.19]How did we get here?
[25:29.31]In the castle, I can't expect any kind of help.
[25:32.77]I shall be left to my own devices, with Mina's life hanging by a thread.
[25:37.85]Once more, I place my life in the hands of God and St.
[25:40.95]George.
[25:42.02]May they walk beside me during the battle.
[25:46.81]Hey, I wonder if it's part three or if we're just going to go.
[25:50.23]I think we're going.
[25:54.90]I think I think there's still more.
[26:00.76]Mature game for mature audiences, that's right.
[26:07.26]So I've been locked in.
[26:09.58]I'm back at the first games area.
[26:13.46]Check that scroll in your inventory.
[26:21.84]I think he took all my shit.
[26:43.53]Another one of these?
[26:44.25]Oh shit.
[26:46.37]I don't want to do that again.
[26:51.12]Oh, okay, we're fine.
[27:02.81]Ring?
[27:03.31]No.
[27:04.87]Spectacles?
[27:05.39]No.
[27:07.67]Is it a keyhole?
[27:08.42]Is it a keyhole?
[27:10.58]I can't see.
[27:11.84]It just kind of scratches on it.
[27:23.36]Alright, remember where that is.
[27:24.30]Shit, another box.
[27:30.58]I can't... This is garlic juice.
[27:43.44]So I need to either get a key or break this somehow.
[27:46.04]Alright.
[27:53.21]So there's quite a few things over here.
[27:54.61]I can't go in here.
[28:02.12]This is a weird little... This is a cranny I can't get into.
[28:05.66]Mm-hmm.
[28:26.35]I don't think there's anything over here.
[28:27.71]Alright, so... Fuck.
[28:50.11]I have a syringe of this now.
[28:53.81]You missing some items?
[29:00.41]I think he took everything, so.
[29:01.41]I think it is planned.
[29:03.77]Alright, where do I want to go here?
[29:07.61]I wish I could go under there.
[29:09.59]Oh, by the way, tomorrow.
[29:20.31]Gonna be playing repo.
[29:24.21]Ster asked he was like, hey, do you want to play and then the believe the horsemen are going to be involved?
[29:35.93]And then I want to play some more Monster Hunter.
[29:40.55]I know that Styr has already gone through the campaign and I think... I don't know how far Vinny or Poke have gotten.
[29:46.38]I know they were playing, I just don't know exactly how far.
[29:49.64]I think we're all kind of maybe getting close to being able to play that game in like a higher rank.
[29:56.53]I also know Etalyx wanted to play it too, so... There are people that want to play Monster Hunter.
[30:08.11]So we'll see.
[30:09.67]Um, what am I missing here?
[30:11.21]Maybe I can move a block.
[30:22.34]I rank as eight hours in if you skip.
[30:23.84]Yeah, the last thing I did is, I don't want to spoil anything, but I think I got to the chapter two boss.
[30:29.22]I think I just ended that.
[30:31.52]Um, so I think there's only a few hours left.
[30:33.73]Maybe I should try to just open the door.
[30:41.56]Is it the same code?
[30:43.18]That'd be funny if he made his luggage the same code.
[30:45.30]What was it?
[30:48.68]Nine seven.
[30:57.75]Nine four six two.
[31:00.15]Am I just skipping this one?
[31:14.48]How much did that just skip?
[31:19.44]I don't want to look at the green neon thing anymore.
[31:26.31]Every time I open that, I know it hurts 8,000 people here's eyes.
[31:31.41]You just have to flip it.
[31:32.15]Okay, I would have figured that out in five seconds.
[31:39.40]Oh my god.
[31:43.36]Um...
[31:47.90]Brush his teeth.
[31:48.48]Give him some Novocaine.
[31:53.06]Alright, you put something in his mouth.
[32:01.07]What do I put in here?
[32:07.01]Nope.
[32:09.03]I don't have it.
[32:09.51]Okay.
[32:13.64]Okay.
[32:15.80]This thing's gonna come alive and try to eat me or something, I don't know what.
[32:31.25]Have you brushed your teeth once this week?
[32:33.85]I find that to be the most repulsive, disgusting thing on Earth.
[32:38.75]I brush my teeth every fucking single day.
[32:47.11]There's nothing more repulsive than somebody doesn't brush their teeth, Artoo.
[32:50.81]Oh, Artoo!
[32:52.39]I've come to terms with that.
[32:53.39]I am C-3PO.
[32:55.05]Somebody sent me a clip and I was like, this person's full of shit.
[32:58.69]And then I watched it and I do a lot of the things that C-3PO does.
[33:02.83]It was annoying.
[33:12.75]Did you floss?
[33:14.57]Yeah.
[33:17.04]Yeah?
[33:20.22]Gotta be a pixel I'm missing.
[33:24.09]Do you relate to him more now that you respect him?
[33:30.05]I always respected him.
[33:30.91]C-3PO was cool.
[33:31.79]What was wrong with him?
[33:32.65]He always had a bunch of knowledge.
[33:33.75]He was funny.
[33:34.25]He had the banter with R2 and Luke.
[33:39.38]He was Luke's right-hand man.
[33:41.86]Everyone thinks it's Han Solo.
[33:43.12]Nope.
[33:43.90]It was C-3PO.
[33:45.04]Human-cyborg relations.
[33:47.70]He was annoying?
[33:49.00]No.
[33:50.43]I know C-3PO was not annoying.
[33:53.23]There was a propaganda machine that they did to make him annoying retroactively in the new movies.
[34:01.35]He was not annoying in the old movies.
[34:03.51]He was cool and he was funny and people liked him.
[34:06.46]They retroactively made him annoying to make like the, oh look, C-3PO was always annoying, wasn't he?
[34:12.88]No, he wasn't.
[34:18.80]And then everybody saw that and was like, oh yeah, he was annoying.
[34:22.08]Fuck that guy.
[34:23.48]Oh, by the way, anything that was made before 1999, it was awful.
[34:31.00]You both, C-3PO was a necessary evil.
[34:50.81]Okay, I'm not gonna, we're not gonna, Seath Reaper was cool because he tap danced.
[34:59.19]Yeah, and when C-3PO, when the doors open, and Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, and Princess Leia, they're all hostage, they're tied up against the wall, and oh no, Darth Vader's gonna come in and get them, and oh, he's gonna kill them.
[35:13.31]C-3PO, when the doors open, that scene, when Darth Vader walks in and starts playing the anthem, and C-3PO hits him in the head with a bottle,
[35:24.02]And he falls down and they can escape.
[35:26.32]That's the only reason why the Rebel Alliance was able to continue.
[35:30.58]So... If he didn't sneak in there and tell a couple of jokes to the stormtroopers that let him in... And... I'm sorry, that's... Then the Rebel Alliance does not do anything for it.
[35:49.53]Where's the one pixel that I didn't click on?
[35:52.34]That part was sick.
[35:52.94]That part was awesome.
[35:55.22]That's like the best part of one of the old movies.
[35:59.29]Fuck.
[35:59.95]You can't say one of the old movies.
[36:01.91]It doesn't work anymore.
[36:02.87]I failed.
[36:03.21]The performance is gone.
[36:05.41]You have to say Empire Strikes Back.
[36:08.15]Otherwise, you're full of shit.
[36:09.67]One of the old movies, it's already gone.
[36:12.53]My lie performance took a nosedive right there.
[36:27.83]There's another door up there?
[36:32.55]Was there a second door?
[36:33.39]I can't go in.
[36:36.37]That's the one I came through.
[36:38.55]Second door.
[36:39.17]It was already cooked the second you said... I can't see.
[36:44.26]The chat gets blocked a little.
[36:46.14]Something with F-L-O.
[36:58.00]Oh, fuck.
[36:58.46]Okay, hold on.
[37:00.68]Shovel, finally.
[37:02.10]And... A C-3PO human-cyborg-relation melee weapon.
[37:07.10]To be used on Darth Vader.
[37:23.00]You have to throw away all of your Star Wars t-shirts.
[37:25.84]I don't wear, I don't wear them any, I don't really wear them anymore.
[37:30.18]I only wore them to kind of hang out at the house.
[37:32.08]Just like, ah, I'm just wearing this or whatever.
[37:33.61]It's more comfy clothes.
[37:39.45]But I wasn't like, I wasn't a huge fan of the, of the new movies.
[37:49.96]I thought they were okay.
[37:50.81]I thought they were... The Force Awakens was like, alright, cool.
[37:53.71]Where are we going with this?
[37:54.45]And then it was like, oh, this is not good.
[37:57.09]And then it was like, oh, this is really not that good.
[37:59.95]But I accept the fact that the movies are fine.
[38:04.47]And it doesn't matter.
[38:15.26]So what do I dig with this?
[38:16.14]Oh, maybe I can break this open now.
[38:17.64]Check it out.
[38:20.91]Boom.
[38:21.37]Nope.
[38:22.69]Boom.
[38:23.07]Nope.
[38:24.27]Nope.
[38:27.89]Um... Can I break the lock with it?
[38:33.47]No.
[38:35.43]No.
[38:35.63]Is there a place to dig that I didn't see?
[38:36.97]I accept the fact that they were bad.
[38:40.39]Um...
[38:44.24]I just think it was the craziest idea ever to have it be, you know, let's have three different distinct directors with three different visions and three completely different ways they want to take the story, do the same story at the same time.
[38:58.10]I just, I wouldn't, why?
[39:04.54]One vision.
[39:07.56]One nine-hour movie.
[39:10.42]They could have blown everybody away.
[39:13.54]By the way, guys, Star Wars The Force Awakens, the movie's nine hours.
[39:18.01]What the fuck?
[39:18.65]That would've been huge.
[39:27.47]I don't think even the movies combined are nine hours.
[39:29.33]I think they're like seven and a half.
[39:35.86]Um... Oh, hold on.
[39:40.74]There's gotta be a reason why I can look over here, right?
[39:49.96]The first movie to have a billion dollar budget.
[39:57.52]The original trilogy was three different directors.
[40:01.46]George Lucas wrote them all.
[40:04.72]Checkmate.
[40:18.70]I'm so stuck here.
[40:26.54]Do you think Chewbacca could take Dracula in a fight?
[40:29.34]Um, no.
[40:37.41]I mean, it's a shovel.
[40:38.35]It's got to be something I can dig into the back of this.
[40:41.67]Maybe I put the shovel in the thing's mouth or put the bar or the pipe in its mouth.
[40:45.97]I mean, might as well try it.
[40:51.18]No.
[40:56.21]climb up the stones wait climb up the uh stones oh my god you can actually do that
[41:29.64]nice did I miss anything here let me make sure I don't miss you should just no clip to the end of the game you know I really hope that that all I'll use zoomers here right now that you just hey just why don't you just hit the uh tilde and just no clip to the last cutscene I mean why why are you doing that why are you doing this
[41:55.29]I really hope that you sit around and actually learn this and learn something.
[41:59.83]And actually play it and do the puzzles and shit.
[42:03.61]But I'm leading by example here.
[42:07.25]I did all of them on my own.
[42:09.13]Nobody helped me do any of these.
[42:11.47]At least five or six solutions I didn't read from the chat and then pretend I knew what to do.
[42:17.27]That's been definitely not five times.
[42:20.23]So... Got it.
[42:28.31]I can't take the bullet?
[42:31.82]What is this?
[42:35.04]Okay.
[42:43.93]Does that go into this thing's mouth?
[42:48.47]Hmm.
[42:57.91]Is there a rope or a string or a... They were calling me a cheater.
[43:05.90]We're doing this.
[43:06.52]We're doing it together.
[43:07.36]We're just hanging out doing this together.
[43:12.64]Amber, I'm pulling for you.
[43:14.02]We're all in this together.
[43:17.58]First person that says what that's from gets VIP for one second in my mind, not in real life.
[43:25.51]Okay, good.
[43:27.15]Hey, Hades!
[43:29.25]Congratulations on your VIP for one second right now.
[43:33.17]We're all thanking it.
[43:35.65]And now it's been removed.
[43:38.43]Congratulations.
[44:04.74]Can't just smash it?
[44:15.15]I paid for you today?
[44:17.63]What does that mean?
[44:23.73]Oh, does that mean you subbed?
[44:25.61]Oh, I was like, wait, what?
[44:28.31]Oh, wait, I know I prayed for you today.
[44:32.01]Oh, shit.
[44:33.31]I was about to be like, thanks for the money.
[44:36.13]Thanks for this.
[44:36.87]I appreciate that.
[44:38.25]No, really, I do.
[44:40.03]That's very kind of you.
[44:40.73]I appreciate it, honestly.
[44:41.61]I've been in this room for 40 minutes.
[44:53.78]What's happening?
[44:55.96]We're talking about Star Wars movies.
[44:58.16]I know all the Star Wars movies.
[44:59.96]I know we all don't like them here.
[45:01.70]That's the easiest upvotes in history.
[45:08.79]I don't like the new Star Wars movies.
[45:12.41]And the slot machine just hit 777 on being, um, agreeable.
[45:39.14]I poked my voodoo doll for you today.
[45:41.18]Oh, please.
[45:41.88]Stop.
[45:49.12]You, you should be putting that doll into a nice, like, cool gel or something.
[45:55.98]That's like, like a bad, like a, get up, make a hot tub.
[45:59.18]And I put, put that into, put me into a little room that has air conditioning and some nice scents in it and stuff.
[46:07.25]And like a little hot tub that I can go in and stuff.
[46:09.79]Don't, oh, I'm going to poke you with this.
[46:11.43]Oh, come on, please.
[46:15.25]How cliche.
[46:17.05]You could do something cool.
[46:18.21]You could have me, um, like put like a nice breeze on, on my face.
[46:21.55]Like, come on.
[46:22.98]How cliche.
[46:30.46]I didn't even see this, but okay.
[46:32.36]Can I do anything here?
[46:46.27]I was gonna laugh if I actually could touch that.
[47:01.86]Hey, well, by the way, that person's praying.
[47:03.27]That person prayed for me.
[47:04.61]So... Gotta make sure... We need more prayers to counteract the fucking weirdo with the voodoo doll.
[47:22.80]pass it on alright let's let's say let's just pray for everybody here okay how's that sound
[47:46.01]Hey, if people, look, let me just tell you, if people have a nice thing to say, right?
[47:50.11]If you actually are like, oh, I have a couple of things, nice things I want to say about you.
[47:54.77]Hey, you know what?
[47:55.21]That's positive.
[47:55.71]That's the positive fucking energy, right?
[47:57.89]We need more of that.
[48:12.62]I'm so stuck on this.
[48:19.36]Wishing for compliments.
[48:21.00]Okay, I'm just talking and clicking in random directions.
[48:26.41]What do I have for items?
[48:27.27]Alright, let's go.
[48:28.07]I've been sitting around talking.
[48:35.67]I got a pole, a shovel, and a hammer.
[48:43.46]And a spool.
[48:47.75]Something I can do up here with it or it's going to be one little spot that I can interact with.
[48:58.99]Chisel one of the blocks.
[49:00.86]That's actually a really good idea.
[49:12.44]Wait, what?
[49:16.91]What are you talking about?
[49:18.91]That sounded really fake that sounded like I was faking that but I got it
[49:38.60]dynamite and this is good this is awesome this is the dynamite that's at a slot machine this is slot machine dynamite that's how you know it's going to be awesome it's going to be a times 10 multiplier or something there's no other little stick sticking out that I can grab right
[50:11.86]Alright, so I got dynamite.
[50:13.55]I think I'll put the dynamite in that thing's mouth.
[50:15.25]I think I got it.
[50:18.73]Yeah, that's definitely where it goes.
[50:19.71]Let's do this first because I don't think I want to die.
[50:29.74]Wait.
[50:32.42]Um, uh-oh.
[50:40.25]Okay, then light this.
[50:41.65]Why can't I light it?
[51:11.35]Did I screw it up?
[51:18.41]Maybe a detonator?
[51:21.19]Maybe I do need a detonator.
[51:22.09]That's true.
[51:27.43]You need that plunger thing.
[51:28.56]You need the cartoon, like the Acme.
[51:35.30]Where do I get that?
[51:36.06]I feel like I've looked everywhere here.
[51:42.70]C-3PO would have figured this out.
[51:44.94]No, the best part about being C-3PO is... Wait, what?
[51:48.98]Another one?
[51:52.13]Everybody else figures it out around you.
[51:54.77]You contribute sometimes and make comments on stuff.
[52:01.00]And you also have a ton of knowledge that nobody cares about, but it's still kind of interesting.
[52:08.97]And you smacked Darth Vader in the head with the bottle that time.
[52:11.66]And you saved everybody.
[52:12.88]And it's the only reason why the Rebel Alliance was able to succeed.
[52:19.16]Wait.
[52:20.12]Hold on.
[52:21.72]Did it just... Did I get an indicator?
[52:23.28]Hold on.
[52:31.43]No.
[52:31.87]I thought... Am I crazy or did I...
[52:47.01]People doing the alerts.
[52:48.95]Check the block in the room.
[52:52.02]It went by too fast.
[53:05.73]Check the block.
[53:06.85]Check the stone block in the room with the and that's all I saw.
[53:25.08]What the fuck?
[53:26.86]There it is.
[53:27.66]Okay, got it.
[53:30.94]I was... Okay, I was... It was a one pixel thing.
[53:35.04]Because I stood up there and I scanned the whole thing 20 minutes ago.
[53:38.75]Should I put another one in there?
[53:48.83]Alright, let's do it.
[53:55.13]Oh my god!
[53:56.01]I'm so traumatized.
[54:06.90]That actually was loud too.
[54:24.28]Ooh, no.
[54:27.48]Not the chess puzzle.
[54:35.31]Get frickin exploded.
[54:41.99]Oh my God.
[54:45.73]If I had, he's talking about dolls.
[54:48.79]If there was a doll that you pulled the string and said a catchphrase or something, that would be one of them.
[54:55.64]Oh my God.
[54:56.78]And then the next one would be, oh my God.
[55:09.35]And then the next one would be, oh my God.
[55:16.10]And it would just cycle between those three.
[55:24.70]Creepy.
[55:28.02]And one of them would beatbox.
[55:29.73]Oh, God.
[55:30.29]Yeah, it would be like... I wouldn't want those.
[55:41.65]I would not want those.
[55:42.33]I would want that removed.
[55:50.17]You could tell me as a marketer that that would make me like... That would sell like 5,000 more units and I'd say don't sell that.
[55:57.98]Don't put that in.
[55:58.90]I don't want that to be sold.
[56:00.06]By the way, I'm gonna take a quick break.
[56:04.27]Get up and stretch.
[56:05.25]BRB time.
[56:05.73]It's been an hour.
[56:07.93]We'll do this chess puzzle.
[56:12.84]See you in a few minutes.
[56:20.78]No, I would not want it.
[56:22.52]It would be... I wouldn't be able to handle that.
[56:24.74]I already did the U2s thing, and that was the limit.
[56:29.32]That was my limit.
[56:31.71]For that kind of thing.
[56:36.09]Alright, I'll be back.
[56:36.63]I'm going to be back in about five minutes, so... Otto is looking for some food.
[56:44.21]See you soon.
[64:10.04]Okay.
[64:12.18]So is it good?
[64:13.32]He's taken care of.
[64:21.38]You've gone for too long.
[64:22.02]I forgot that you were coming back.
[64:23.74]Well, I'm back.
[64:24.18]I'm here now.
[64:34.77]Did you hear about that TF2 update?
[64:37.56]I feel like every six months or so, there's a big TF2 update coming.
[64:44.40]And... Is it actually coming?
[64:48.35]Are they doing something?
[64:49.27]What are they doing?
[64:54.47]It doesn't change anything?
[64:57.67]It's never actually a big update, though.
[65:01.79]It did come out.
[65:02.32]It came out.
[65:05.15]Oh, that's right.
[65:05.93]The source code.
[65:07.61]That's right.
[65:10.80]Well, what you meant to say was, did you see the new TF2 update where there's all the Freddy Fazbear characters in it?
[65:23.91]And it's like the engineer is like the chica and the scout is the bunny and Freddy is the heavy.
[65:34.84]I mean, I haven't played that one yet.
[65:46.81]Is it really worth it for Dracula?
[65:49.15]That's the only thing I saw of your whole message, so I apologize and I just like I'm just I didn't mean to bump you there.
[65:56.14]I think these games are wonderful.
[65:57.50]I think both games we played today are wonderful.
[66:00.50]And I think that if you like point and click adventure type games, first person missed type games.
[66:05.81]This one is much easier than missed.
[66:08.92]And it's kind of funny.
[66:09.72]It's kind of weird.
[66:11.78]It's a great game to play with a group of friends.
[66:13.48]I would say if you get some people together.
[66:15.24]Or on like a no screen share or something and.
[66:21.50]I have a lot of fun.
[66:27.38]OK.
[66:33.48]Don't tell me what to do with my friends.
[66:35.95]OK.
[66:37.81]Sure.
[66:47.55]I didn't tell you what to do with your friends.
[66:49.05]I suggested an interesting experience.
[66:53.27]And somebody asked me, so I answered it.
[66:55.85]What's wrong with you?
[67:01.25]OK, so let's see.
[67:05.81]Spectacles.
[67:09.80]Yep.
[67:12.10]OK, can I do that out here?
[67:30.41]Holding something, item.
[67:31.59]I can probably grab something out of their hands.
[67:34.61]Shovel?
[67:34.93]It's going to be... I'm surprised it's not this one here.
[67:54.19]Grabbing the head off the shoulders?
[67:55.25]It's not that apparently.
[67:56.03]Do you still smoke fat doinks?
[68:07.60]Uh, I am a consumer of cannabis products.
[68:12.38]Uh, sometimes.
[68:14.40]Not on stream.
[68:16.74]I haven't done, I haven't been, you know, I've been a consumer of some of those products sometimes.
[68:20.33]I'm 21 years and over.
[68:22.95]And every time I say this, people say, why is he saying that?
[68:27.74]But I can't just make a funny way to say it.
[68:29.72]Hmm.
[68:48.20]Something in the hallway that I didn't get?
[68:58.44]He said it like a psychopath would.
[69:03.18]I- I com- I disagree.
[69:09.00]Oh, wait.
[69:19.73]Come on.
[69:25.01]What is it?
[69:27.04]There's a button.
[69:27.82]There's a... You sound like a fed.
[69:35.89]Marijuana is legal in... Nevada.
[70:05.66]Yeah, it's not legal federally.
[70:12.10]Which is fucking insane.
[70:15.27]There's like 40 states that have at least a medical program and then recreational.
[70:34.52]There it is, OK.
[70:39.63]Dynamite?
[70:43.89]Stupid, I live in California, but I could get fired for it.
[70:48.85]Yeah.
[70:55.91]Ring?
[70:56.27]No.
[71:09.16]I mean, I will say, right?
[71:10.44]Like... Have, you know, have the same... Have the same relationship with marijuana that you would have with like alcohol.
[71:19.87]Right?
[71:42.90]Remember, Benjamin Franklin.
[72:14.15]I've said that a million times.
[72:16.21]Okay, pull the string.
[72:17.75]Pull the string in my back.
[72:26.78]As Ben Franklin said, all things in moderation.
[72:30.64]That'd be the fourth one.
[72:31.34]Alright, I've walked in a circle.
[72:42.37]What do I do with that eye?
[72:46.89]I can't take it out.
[72:49.67]And I don't have anything to put in.
[72:57.03]Weed is recreational in Nevada.
[72:58.94]Oh, yeah, it is.
[72:59.74]Yep.
[73:26.18]If it's one of these rocks, I'm going to be so pissed.
[73:27.79]Oh my fucking God.
[73:28.75]It's one of the rocks.
[73:39.25]But again, I would, okay.
[73:41.29]Smoking weed or consuming, uh, cannabis products, uh, C-3PO, uh, consuming cannabis products, uh, Master Luke.
[73:49.07]Um, yeah, I would say the same thing about booze, man.
[73:53.05]Don't fucking drink a shitload and fuck yourself up.
[74:01.96]It's one thing to be, you know, oh, I enjoy doing this.
[74:05.02]It's relaxing or whatever.
[74:06.52]But just fucking... Don't overdo it.
[74:11.44]Please, do not.
[74:19.21]And it's really easy to.
[74:20.13]It is really for all this shit.
[74:26.03]You're not my dad?
[74:28.51]No, I'm not.
[75:00.56]Nothing on the ground?
[75:13.57]Music got scarier.
[75:20.09]Uh, what outhouse door am I going to open?
[75:24.58]Oh boy, we got a weapon.
[75:28.18]Weapon, lantern.
[75:31.61]Magical jeweled pendant.
[75:33.11]What is that for?
[75:48.83]That doesn't look like very sturdy wood.
[76:00.69]I feel like I could put a shoulder through that and break it.
[76:04.01]And I'm only 143 pounds, 144 pounds.
[76:11.16]Would you get pissed if I got a tattoo of you?
[76:15.42]That's a, that's, that's a little, that's a little, that's a little sus.
[76:32.25]Was there something else that I can do with the pendant?
[76:43.71]No, I don't recommend you do that because in like two or three years when you look back and say, I thought this guy was funny, that was stupid.
[76:49.04]You're going to be really annoyed that you have that.
[76:54.50]My opinion is don't ever tattoo any kind of media on yourself because you don't know if you're going to actually like it in like five years.
[77:17.19]Like, okay, when Star Wars The Force Awakens came out, I'm like, oh man, I could get a Star Wars tattoo that says, Star Wars, the sequels are back!
[77:26.80]And if I was really excited about The Force Awakens, and then five to six years later, um, I don't know if I want that one.
[77:37.32]That would be a fucking terrible tattoo.
[77:52.62]Lower back.
[77:53.66]Lower back.
[77:55.24]Oh, my God.
[77:55.96]Lower back.
[78:00.89]Star Wars is back.
[78:02.79]Alright, let me pay attention.
[78:07.53]I've been doing a lot of talking and just nothing.
[78:16.74]One of the... Here we go.
[78:17.48]Okay.
[78:17.60]Okay.
[78:19.21]Oh no, one of these skeletons is going to get up, aren't they?
[78:24.24]Oh my god, one of these skeletons is going to get up.
[78:40.29]This is actually kind of creepy, it is.
[79:10.49]Help us know.
[79:13.38]Who that key?
[79:14.66]Nope.
[79:19.18]This could be a VR horror game.
[79:28.23]I'm going to have to shoot one of these.
[79:29.21]I know it.
[79:29.87]What about this?
[79:30.27]Should I?
[79:31.02]Yep.
[79:33.66]Yep.
[79:36.56]I, Kazan, Great Chamberlain of Prince Radu, with my loyal fellow prisoners, have created a system for finding my sovereign's tomb.
[79:46.14]You, who have found me, release my master from this torture, and may the grace of God go with you.
[79:54.04]Okay.
[79:57.18]Scared about picking this up.
[80:03.66]One of them didn't have a head, right?
[80:07.42]Who didn't have a head?
[80:16.16]You've got a head.
[80:16.78]One of them didn't have a head, right?
[80:26.23]Can I put that somewhere else?
[80:32.15]Wait.
[80:33.37]I feel like I keep catching something.
[80:37.94]What about tattooing your face on your face?
[80:43.26]It would just look like you put eyeliner all over every... You would just look cel-shaded.
[80:47.74]Alright, I think I'm... I think I got everything.
[81:07.99]um okay how do I get out of here how do I get out of here there we go okay um okay I got a skull and that skull can be oh skull
[81:36.18]Suppose here.
[81:42.18]It doesn't.
[81:55.29]Wait.
[81:56.35]Why can I climb up this?
[81:58.37]OK, I found it.
[81:59.37]Oh, is that a knife?
[82:11.72]What was that?
[82:14.62]Ooh!
[82:16.88]I've got a loaded crossbow.
[82:24.90]SCORN.
[82:28.73]SCORN.
[82:28.91]Alright, we'll have to fight these guys for sure.
[82:47.12]I don't think I can leave yet.
[82:48.00]Maybe I should just maybe I should shoot one.
[82:58.09]Can I shoot through this?
[83:02.46]Fit through this.
[83:20.03]I've come to realize that a lot of what I do on this channel is saying something that 10 of you will understand.
[83:26.67]And when you do that enough times and there's enough difference of you doing them from different references, all 12,000 of you eventually will have something that you know what it is.
[83:38.88]Just, it's going to take like years for that to happen though.
[84:00.39]What about maybe... Should I put the necklace on?
[84:02.08]Wait, I can combine this with something.
[84:05.66]No.
[84:06.46]Combine this with this?
[84:08.02]No.
[84:08.66]Matches in here?
[84:10.34]Yep.
[84:14.57]What about this, though?
[84:17.51]This and dynamite?
[84:18.65]This and... Oh my god, I didn't even look at this.
[84:20.85]What is this?
[84:21.31]Um...
[84:24.52]okay it wants me to put a skull down and stack a bunch of shit was it the shelf wait there's the well there's the so I gotta go back out there and stack a bunch of stuff up skull dynamite stick or slingshot stone
[84:55.44]I feel like I have most of this.
[84:56.26]Need some puzzle solving shoes.
[85:15.69]Yeah, well, I tried to put them on.
[85:16.99]They were like a full two sizes too small.
[85:20.19]It hurt to be in them.
[85:25.44]You can't make a universal pair of shoes.
[85:28.57]It doesn't work like that.
[85:32.69]Only one group of people that have that exact shoe size can actually use them.
[85:39.06]You got that in a size 13?
[85:43.30]Didn't think so.
[86:08.43]That's the plot of Cinderella.
[86:13.71]Shit.
[86:17.21]Alright.
[86:17.90]I can't get out of here.
[86:18.84]I've been doing a lot of talking.
[86:21.76]I've been talking too much.
[86:26.20]There is a limit for how much you should talk on a stream.
[86:28.80]I've hit it.
[86:38.90]Does one of these need to have the jewel put in it or something?
[86:43.05]This can combine.
[86:44.27]This is going to combine with something.
[86:51.15]I must not have the item.
[86:52.21]Okay, well, whatever.
[86:56.53]That was stupid.
[86:57.19]I don't know why I did that.
[86:58.21]Is the map... Oh, wait a minute.
[87:11.74]So this is one of the cells.
[87:14.44]And then I have to stack a bunch of shit up to a candle.
[87:18.22]So it's the corner.
[87:19.21]It's the corner of one of these cells.
[87:22.85]I get in here.
[87:26.73]It's here.
[87:29.35]It's up here.
[87:31.79]Right?
[87:31.95]Because this is the circle.
[87:35.06]It's this corner right here.
[87:42.44]Right?
[87:55.33]Is it?
[88:11.17]There's one, two, three, four, five, six rooms.
[88:15.37]It's the room in the corner.
[88:17.19]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[88:24.63]It's the one I was just on.
[88:32.30]Yeah, this is it.
[88:33.28]It's right here.
[88:34.48]What about it?
[88:36.76]Stack it.
[88:46.76]I don't get it.
[88:48.32]Oh, okay.
[88:49.34]I get it.
[88:55.35]Now I have a bone.
[88:57.53]So bone goes where?
[89:01.93]Is this pre-recorded?
[89:06.35]Um, why, why do we even, why do we even answer these?
[89:16.13]Put the bone and skull together.
[89:18.41]I can't combine them.
[89:23.79]Ooh.
[89:26.23]Okay.
[89:28.83]Now I've got... That's done.
[89:32.47]Then it's what?
[89:33.01]Skull, dynamite, then that?
[89:35.94]Skull, dynamite, then that.
[89:38.68]Where?
[89:43.66]What the frickin' heck is that, guys?
[90:01.13]Check all the ones on the ground because I missed anything.
[90:05.09]Yeah, did that.
[90:05.67]What about this one here?
[90:12.10]One more here.
[90:14.12]No and no OK.
[90:20.14]So.
[90:22.23]Where is this area that it wants me to build this on top of?
[90:27.99]Well, that's just wonderful.
[90:33.86]Um, what does it say?
[90:35.32]Hmm.
[90:48.62]Green shit time?
[90:49.44]Oh, I didn't have an option.
[90:59.76]Is this mirrored?
[91:03.25]You stack it in the well?
[91:20.91]I think go after the well.
[91:31.70]Maybe here?
[91:33.30]This is very interestingly empty.
[91:42.08]Hey, can you tell the VOD watchers I said hi?
[91:46.73]No.
[91:49.15]You're gonna have to do that on your own.
[92:06.62]Stack them up here.
[92:07.34]I don't know.
[92:11.95]I'm taking too long figuring this out.
[92:20.07]I don't... Wait.
[92:21.17]No.
[92:23.84]Combine all the items?
[92:28.08]I don't... I think... I think that's... Yeah, you can't... If I click this, it opens it as if I'm going to use it.
[92:35.84]So it's the dynamite.
[92:37.01]It's the skull.
[92:38.05]It's the bone with the jewel on it.
[92:42.31]Maybe the pole, but.
[92:46.57]The Dunkin Donuts order.
[92:48.41]It is a. A chocolate.
[92:53.92]A chocolate filled frosting donut.
[92:57.48]You know what the powdery shit on the outside.
[93:00.44]And then it is a blueberry iced coffee with two sugars.
[93:16.15]I haven't been to Dunkin Donuts in years though.
[93:18.39]The last time I've tried it, it's been pretty ass each time.
[93:35.78]If you get a good Dunkin Donuts though, it's great.
[93:38.30]But I feel like that's kind of rare nowadays.
[93:42.53]Any helpers?
[93:50.53]That's a high school girl order.
[93:57.38]I'm not allowed to enjoy things because somebody likes it.
[94:00.96]Somebody also likes it.
[94:10.02]Every coffee that I drink is... I just drink black coffee.
[94:14.08]But if I'm going to go to Dunkin' Donuts, I'm not just going to get a black coffee at Dunkin' Donuts.
[94:18.06]I'm going to get something special and a little out there.
[94:21.25]I only go to Dunkin' Donuts once every year at this point.
[94:25.87]I'm going to get something special.
[94:31.39]Coconut's good too.
[94:36.18]Did you get the medal?
[94:39.24]That one?
[94:41.73]I think that's on top of the bone.
[94:54.21]VRJosh is carrying this playthrough.
[94:59.25]Yeah, there's a few mods that are just like, they're just ready to rock and roll.
[95:11.45]I'm literally just watching it on YouTube.
[95:16.53]You're pre-watching to watch this.
[95:19.84]That's so funny.
[95:23.36]Watching another stream of it before I stream it.
[95:28.46]There's nothing funnier than that.
[95:30.52]I love that.
[95:31.10]That's so great.
[95:34.56]It's pre-gaming.
[95:44.56]Exit the room and then exit.
[95:46.18]Put the bone on.
[95:47.62]Put the skull.
[95:49.06]I couldn't read that.
[95:53.91]What?
[95:54.11]Question marks.
[95:54.61]Question marks.
[95:55.07]What?
[95:55.45]Alright.
[96:02.97]Exit and go out.
[96:05.29]Open the drawer on the table and take the necklace.
[96:07.34]Okay.
[96:08.18]That's the only thing I needed to see.
[96:09.46]I don't need any more spoilers.
[96:10.54]I already know what I need to do.
[96:24.33]This looks like I can stack it, doesn't it?
[96:29.56]Why did you gargle?
[96:33.06]Um... I didn't.
[96:46.41]I can't, somebody keeps trying to tell me what to do.
[96:48.39]He says, get the necklace.
[96:49.23]I got the necklace.
[96:51.11]They said, put the skull on the ground.
[96:52.77]But what ground?
[96:54.01]I don't know what ground I need to put it on.
[96:55.85]There's so many grounds here.
[97:08.80]And the chat is being covered by a little thing.
[97:12.94]I can't see.
[97:15.36]Bone plus skull.
[97:16.96]Yeah, but where do I stack?
[97:22.56]Cat's moving way too fast.
[97:24.35]How about the skull and garlic oil?
[97:27.51]Shit, that almost sounded right.
[97:33.77]Should be able to be right in front of the door.
[97:39.46]No more one pixel Andes, okay?
[97:42.96]You've got to be kidding me.
[98:04.49]lantern is it the lantern first the other door oh my god and you can own this dragon doll that makes the sound isn't it this is so funny
[98:40.88]Hello?
[98:44.88]No.
[98:51.54]Yeah, the paragraph spam is funny because I can get to... I'm trying to jump in the middle of the paragraph.
[98:56.68]Am I missing an item?
[99:03.61]Light the lantern with the matches and then put the lantern... somewhere else?
[99:19.43]behind the skull.
[99:26.15]I don't... I don't think I... How would I... That was probably the hardest one.
[99:38.66]And it's because...
[99:41.11]So what was all this bullshit for then?
[99:43.38]This was just a red herring.
[99:44.56]This meant nothing.
[99:46.02]I'm sitting here desperately trying to solve this because I'm thinking the two square holes that are taken out have something to do with this.
[99:54.58]This is just lore.
[99:59.82]And then this is... This could be anywhere in the entire game.
[100:07.35]That could be back at Carfax, for all I know.
[100:12.37]I know I had to stack them, but good luck finding the place to stack them.
[100:23.91]Holy shit.
[100:31.75]Oh my goodness.
[100:35.65]Oh, R2.
[100:53.60]Save the game.
[100:57.10]True.
[100:59.56]Very true.
[101:01.12]That one has different contrast.
[101:02.48]It's going to stand up and I'm going to shoot it.
[101:03.78]Watch this.
[101:04.16]Three, two.
[101:08.52]I knew it.
[101:21.40]What's wrong with it?
[101:22.22]Why is it
[101:25.85]actually scared the shit out of me.
[101:27.00]What?
[101:32.50]I thought it was going to be a skeleton.
[101:33.86]That skeleton had a different hue than all the other ones.
[101:50.92]So what do I... Should I drop off some dynamite?
[101:52.96]Just roll some dynamite down the steps.
[101:55.22]Do those fucking TikTok videos where it's... Is the glass gonna break and it... And then just have it explode down here.
[102:01.38]What do I do about this?
[102:02.44]I need light.
[102:04.91]Okay, well obviously I can't do that right now.
[102:13.31]Why can't I just shoot it with a crossbow?
[102:17.09]So it's obviously something with this.
[102:21.59]I think, I don't know.
[102:29.07]You can use the bell gun?
[102:36.82]What?
[102:37.12]I thought it was down the stairs!
[102:40.16]Can I throw the dynamo?
[102:45.14]What am I supposed to do about this?
[102:46.38]Stab him?
[103:08.58]I don't think I have any other oil.
[103:12.97]Garlic oil matches.
[103:15.07]Oh, yep.
[103:32.93]Dead.
[103:40.60]Somewhere to the end of that hallway.
[103:41.73]Jeez.
[103:42.23]Jeez.
[104:12.33]My god, it's the missing piece of the dragon's ring!
[104:15.78]I've found Radu's stone!
[104:26.65]little too excited there you got a little too excited you should probably just not reach and rip it and drench it and scream and facetime all your friends at the same time just reach for it gently why did he jump and bear he grabbed it we bear hugged the fucking thing what was that my goodness I've found it I've done it
[104:55.16]Now, how hard can I shake this fragile thing before it falls?
[104:59.16]Why is there a face?
[105:08.66]Oh, that is creepy.
[105:17.93]Oh, no.
[105:19.23]It's Godwyn.
[105:34.71]back here oh look it we just came completely full circle I remember looking at this in the last game and saying I was like what cool so I have the missing piece
[106:06.75]Okay, I put it back in there?
[106:19.72]I got about an hour left.
[106:21.40]Oh, cool.
[106:22.80]If I beat it and it's still, I mean, yeah, one hour in, um, in, you know, Jeremy dog years and I'm going to say third person.
[106:30.76]I don't know.
[106:31.12]It's fucking annoying.
[106:32.20]I probably annoyed a few of you, but, um, that's probably three or four hours total.
[106:38.11]There's one hour of the walkthrough left.
[106:40.03]Okay.
[106:43.17]Okay.
[106:44.27]So it's like probably like two to three hours.
[106:49.75]I don't want to talk in third person.
[106:51.01]I'm just, you know what I mean?
[106:51.97]I'm just saying, like, it's... If it was me doing it, then it's going to be an extra hour.
[106:58.90]Please forgive me.
[106:59.62]Please forgive me.
[107:00.18]Okay.
[107:02.52]You know what?
[107:02.86]Fuck you.
[107:03.22]I don't care.
[107:04.86]Jeremy says fuck off.
[107:05.72]Okay.
[107:28.05]Is this your heal arc?
[107:33.41]No.
[107:35.47]Nah.
[107:38.06]Oh.
[107:39.22]What is that?
[107:39.62]Oh, that's the thing I was trying to get a long time ago.
[108:00.44]Can't go back down.
[108:02.28]So now let's just go back to the house maybe?
[108:04.34]Is it all going to come full circle here?
[108:06.64]I really dig this screaming pigs ambience.
[108:25.01]Is that what it is?
[108:38.88]Let's see what goes here.
[108:39.84]Do I have to combine something?
[108:41.12]Come on, what is it?
[108:46.82]I'm so close.
[108:47.40]I'm an hour away from beating the game.
[108:58.89]This is where you got the dragon ring.
[109:00.39]Yeah, but how do I... How do I combine them?
[109:03.61]I don't think I can combine them.
[109:08.68]Put the stone in the ring.
[109:10.24]Is there a way I can look at this?
[109:23.28]I can't leave.
[109:23.96]I can't get to the shed.
[109:43.41]Through the bars?
[110:01.10]Whoever you are, leave here immediately.
[110:06.05]The cemetery is in a fragile state of balance.
[110:09.47]Only the icon of St.
[110:10.87]George can counter the evil beings who are in this place.
[110:15.17]If the icon should be damaged in any way, the world as we know it may cease to exist.
[110:20.84]So run, run away and don't look back.
[110:28.23]Whoever you are, leave here immediately.
[110:31.53]The cemetery is in a fragile state of balance.
[110:34.95]Only the icon of St.
[110:36.35]George can counter the evil beings who are in this place.
[110:40.66]If the icon should be damaged in any way, the world as we know it may cease to exist.
[110:46.32]So run.
[110:47.30]Run away and don't look back.
[110:51.62]I have a question.
[110:53.30]I'm just realizing this right now and it's blowing my mind.
[110:59.75]Is this the voice actor for Twinsen?
[111:06.19]Is this Twinsen's voice actor?
[111:07.33]From Twinsen's Odyssey?
[111:15.79]Little Big Adventure?
[111:20.25]That's kind of just blowing my mind right now.
[111:21.51]I think it actually is.
[111:30.55]It is, yes, it is.
[111:31.77]Can you please turn off the squealing?
[111:37.03]Okay, let me get out of here before, so, um, ah, fuck.
[111:42.71]What do I do?
[111:43.49]I'll leave.
[112:05.68]I just want to listen to this Winston's Odyssey soundtrack.
[112:08.41]The bit is so good.
[112:09.47]That's the kind of shit I want to have on BRBs and stuff.
[112:16.59]I have awesome music.
[112:28.14]Can I dig?
[112:36.56]Just leave, leave, leave, leave.
[112:38.38]I can't.
[112:39.04]I need to dig up the icon.
[112:50.07]Where's the digging spot?
[112:57.42]Would you be behind the huge tome?
[113:00.08]What the heck?
[113:05.66]Got it.
[113:06.78]So that was there the whole time.
[113:08.24]Did I play through two video games to go find this one spot?
[113:13.89]If I just dug this up in the first game, I could have beaten Dracula.
[113:23.60]That's pretty cool.
[113:25.22]What a shit hiding spot.
[113:27.83]I thought I was gonna be behind, uh... What did he say he did when in the first game?
[113:31.63]Oh, my three diabolical, whimsical, horrifying chambers of secrets that will kill you.
[113:38.43]The guy buried it behind his shed.
[113:45.78]That's pretty fucking lazy.
[113:54.82]Okay, so what does that do?
[113:56.40]Uh huh.
[114:18.01]Save the game.
[114:21.98]It's getting eerier.
[114:27.10]Look up.
[114:27.40]Alright, if Dracula's face was huge right there, watching me dig up his treasure, and then he disappeared, that'd be so awesome.
[114:46.14]I don't want to leave you with this sound, but I'm going to take another break.
[114:50.20]I don't want to leave you with this sound effect, though.
[114:57.55]I think we're just going to go silent.
[115:04.64]I feel like this is going to drive some of you crazy, so I'm not going to do that.
[115:13.49]There you go.
[115:18.85]Your keyboard has a mute sound?
[115:19.75]Yeah, I can just turn it off.
[115:23.99]If only we had a mute button.
[115:25.33]You have a mute button.
[115:26.05]You just can't mute the other stuff.
[115:27.87]Alright.
[115:35.15]I'll be back.
[115:36.23]See you guys in a minute.
[115:37.43]You know the drill.
[115:42.51]Do I want it?
[115:43.45]What do I want?
[115:44.05]I think I want like a snack.
[115:45.11]No, I'm good.
[115:45.65]I'm good.
[115:46.27]I'll eat in a couple hours.
[115:48.31]Once we finish this, I'll eat.
[115:50.40]I'll be back.
[115:51.14]See you soon.
[115:54.42]Ads are going to start right now.
[120:12.30]Hello, welcome back.
[120:15.10]I got a poll for you.
[120:17.78]Will we see Dracula's bare ass before the credits roll?
[120:22.96]That's pretty, that's potential there.
[120:41.48]You know, there's an opportunity.
[120:43.61]There's already been a little bit of nudity.
[120:45.37]So, I wouldn't put it past him.
[120:55.05]Please, please.
[120:55.78]Alright.
[120:56.40]One of the mods can throw it up there.
[121:08.19]Okay.
[121:08.93]I've got the thing.
[121:09.73]And now...
[121:12.67]It didn't really do anything.
[121:13.81]It just made the sounds a little weirder.
[121:15.45]Are you going to play the other three games?
[121:26.05]Yes.
[121:28.85]I will play the other three games.
[121:32.17]Okay, we've done a back-to-back Dracula Fest here.
[121:34.23]I think we maybe not immediately.
[121:38.16]I got a lot of things I want to do, a lot of games I want to play.
[121:43.68]So we did the, we did a back-to-back, so we'll... Behind one of the, behind one of the tombs.
[121:54.53]How do I get behind one of the... Because I got this.
[122:07.79]That was behind that one.
[122:14.62]Oh, what do I do with that then?
[122:15.83]Should I bury it?
[122:28.63]Something with the tree?
[122:29.27]There's something with the tree when we said the tree.
[122:36.28]Something going on with this tree?
[122:47.77]night vision alright what's the I want to see the poll of this the prediction poll here what is it yes oh that was just a poll a lot of you really a lot of you really think that should they put their channel points where their uh mouth is
[123:19.95]That was 70 plus percent of you said that.
[123:37.32]Use the garlic on the dynamite.
[123:50.94]Stand by the tomb?
[123:54.88]Use the use... Oh, shit.
[123:57.06]The person that does the alarm and a couple of the mods, Josh, stand by the tomb with the... Fuck, I can't read that because it's covered.
[124:03.83]This screen can only use one resolution and it's cutting off half my chat.
[124:08.77]Can you stand by the tomb with that?
[124:14.10]The hole and then use night vision.
[124:20.81]This one here.
[124:30.34]Other one.
[124:52.30]There's one spot here where you can use night vision.
[124:55.00]Oh my God.
[124:55.74]The tree with the cross on the right.
[125:02.14]This should be a U. The U symbol will pop up like here by the open tomb looking toward the gate.
[125:20.01]Like here?
[125:26.23]Go to the open tomb, the one with no cover.
[125:31.85]Oh, that one.
[125:50.94]Go closer to it and then look at the gate.
[125:57.61]The fuck is this game?
[126:07.93]I found it.
[126:10.21]There it is.
[126:10.91]Okay, now what do I do with it?
[126:11.81]Grab it.
[126:16.54]Alright, we're going down.
[126:31.16]I love how crunchy this game really is.
[126:36.10]Other side.
[126:41.27]Let's go.
[126:41.65]Do you remember a week ago?
[126:45.85]When I was talking about how desperately I wanted to get in here?
[127:00.87]It's kind of... Now we're back here.
[127:03.35]Is the lady still here?
[127:04.15]Oh, shit.
[127:06.80]The witch lady might still be here.
[127:09.08]Oh, that's how you get back here.
[127:18.08]Let us bet one of the three stooges are in this game.
[127:20.50]You're going to guarantee to lose.
[127:21.96]Alright, let's go down.
[127:23.38]Can't go in there.
[127:24.04]There it is.
[127:27.37]I can probably go in there in a minute.
[127:30.41]Save it.
[127:38.98]Or tombs?
[127:50.35]Alright, did the prediction go through?
[127:52.45]Did you guys bet on if we're gonna see Dracula's bare ass or not?
[128:02.49]What was the... Yes, okay.
[128:06.42]What was the percentage?
[128:08.98]Cat could just look it up.
[128:10.10]Oh fuck, they could.
[128:15.27]It's this lady.
[128:15.79]Should I shoot her with the crossbow?
[128:26.84]I know why you're here.
[128:29.14]I've seen Mina.
[128:30.76]She's in the castle.
[128:32.89]Oh, okay.
[128:59.83]See, here's how all the believers get absolutely destroyed.
[129:05.77]At the end of the game, right before the credits roll, I pause the game right before Dracula gets, you know, the stake through the heart and there's no bare ass.
[129:14.44]That's when I turn the cam on and I'm in a full Dracula costume and I show my bare ass on camera.
[129:21.90]Sometimes the believers need to get a win here.
[129:25.93]Does the name Kazan mean anything to you?
[129:28.19]He was the Chamberlain of Lord Radu, Dracula's half-brother.
[129:33.35]God rest his soul.
[129:35.04]He disappeared on the same evening as his master and a handful of loyal retainers.
[129:40.24]We didn't always agree with each other, but he was loyal.
[129:44.08]Why do you mention Kazan?
[129:45.76]I found his body and this mysterious parchment was beside him.
[129:51.37]You see these pentagrams drawn on the edges of the parchment?
[129:55.19]They represent the evil forces which reign in the castle.
[129:59.65]As for the text, it is written with a magic alphabet, translating it as child's play.
[130:10.01]What's it say?
[130:12.77]That doesn't look like child's play.
[130:14.23]That looks like magic that adults use and kids don't know how to do and it's hard.
[130:18.25]It speaks of the Grand Knight of the Order of St.
[130:21.39]George, a great warrior in God's service whose body lies in the castle's cemetery.
[130:29.04]The text speaks of a golden cross which was cast to commemorate his feats.
[130:34.30]It's a great symbol of devotion to the divine forces which could wipe out the pentagrams I just told you about.
[130:42.68]It is written that Kazan and his men stole it to prevent Dracula from getting hold of it.
[130:49.91]A very wise move.
[130:51.65]Okay, so I got this translated now.
[130:58.77]Wait, what can I do?
[131:00.27]Why does it have an indicator?
[131:03.97]Oh, come on.
[131:08.59]Why is there an indicator?
[131:10.01]Oh, boy.
[131:12.60]Am I gonna trap her soul in this thing?
[131:16.30]Look at this.
[131:17.28]I found it in Dracula's prisons.
[131:19.67]Good God, I don't believe it.
[131:22.23]This stone belonged to Radu.
[131:25.97]I thought this jewel was gone forever.
[131:30.09]Do you still have the ring?
[131:31.94]Yes, it's here.
[131:33.96]Unbelievable.
[131:35.68]This is what will give you strength in your struggle with Dracula.
[131:40.78]I'm sure he had not foreseen that the ring could be reassembled.
[131:45.10]The two elements are powerful on their own, but the complete ring can destroy him forever.
[131:51.47]How can you reassemble the stone and the ring?
[131:55.15]The ritual states that the ring must be placed on the Dragon's Stell, which is in Dracula's final sanctuary.
[132:02.48]But my powers are strong enough for me to assemble the ring and the stone.
[132:09.26]let the shadows witness my gesture
[132:24.69]That's not Dracula.
[132:25.87]That's not Dracula.
[132:26.69]It looks like he's drinking it.
[132:27.81]He's sucking it up.
[132:56.02]Oh wait!
[132:56.46]She's Dorko!
[132:57.04]What?
[132:57.16]That's a huge reveal.
[132:58.94]Okay.
[133:25.39]Alright, so the final sanctuary is probably up here, I guess.
[133:31.36]Okay.
[133:54.48]No.
[133:57.45]It's Dalaran.
[133:59.91]Sorry.
[134:07.76]So what's the... Why I do that?
[134:21.07]I can't go in here?
[134:21.79]Why not?
[134:26.36]Count Dorco.
[134:30.86]The magical ring?
[134:40.59]That was an ult.
[134:41.35]Yeah, looked like it.
[134:43.07]I can go up here, but... It's made a giant... Okay, I guess I'll go up.
[135:00.68]What's the point of coming up here?
[135:37.77]What's that?
[135:44.65]Dark Souls 2 playthrough?
[135:49.78]That would be kind of fun.
[135:52.80]I played it again recently, like a year ago.
[135:56.92]I'm so sorry for having the wrong opinion saying that Dark Souls 2 was not a good game.
[136:03.92]There's a magnifying glass on the door?
[136:08.36]Is there really?
[136:18.79]Magnifying glass.
[136:24.32]On the upper stairs?
[136:27.58]Oh wait, like up here.
[136:37.47]I thought you meant like there was a... I was looking for a magnifying glass.
[136:49.72]Okay.
[136:51.18]So... Let's go.
[136:53.26]Okay.
[136:59.54]This is going to bring us back to the mine.
[137:01.64]No, is it the minecart?
[137:03.08]I think it is the mine.
[137:14.02]Is that it?
[137:20.60]What about Bloodborne on stream?
[137:24.55]Maybe.
[137:24.85]Can I throw this over there?
[137:34.48]Do I combine this with the dynamite?
[137:37.76]Combine it with the ring.
[137:38.52]Combine it with that.
[137:39.48]Combine it with this.
[137:39.98]Combine it with that.
[137:40.64]Combine it with this.
[137:41.32]Combine it with this.
[137:41.90]Combine it with that.
[137:42.94]Combine it with this.
[137:43.42]Combine it with that.
[137:43.95]Combine it with this.
[137:44.87]Got it.
[137:46.73]Wait, what?
[137:54.27]Wait, is it... Am I shooting?
[137:59.11]I shoot it?
[138:08.38]Where can I use that?
[138:09.94]Whoa, OK, uh.
[138:13.56]I'm going to say up there, right?
[138:15.70]Or across.
[138:20.47]Nice.
[138:30.28]Nice spell.
[138:43.18]Uh-oh, it's the ultimate puzzle.
[138:49.03]Remember?
[138:49.71]He was like, this is the ultimate puzzle.
[138:51.85]He will never complete it.
[138:54.91]Almost missed that.
[139:04.86]Oh boy.
[139:05.18]Uh...
[139:27.98]Okay, I can't do anything with it yet.
[139:30.00]Can I take a screenshot?
[139:39.68]Oh.
[139:46.36]Ooh, okay.
[139:47.60]Ooh, pulled a string.
[139:53.07]Uh...
[140:00.11]one no no no no is it this one I think it's that one what does that mean one one it was on the one I don't know if that I guess it just means one
[140:36.03]Hey, come on.
[140:46.94]One cube.
[140:51.90]Okay.
[140:52.48]One cube.
[140:57.10]There's another way to go out here though.
[140:59.82]Let me check this first.
[141:10.09]Nothing.
[141:29.47]Oh dear, here it is.
[141:32.82]Finally made it.
[141:35.33]to the chess event in World of Warcraft.
[141:54.05]I'm dead.
[141:55.77]What?
[141:59.63]When's the last time I saved?
[142:02.88]Oh shit.
[142:07.11]Wait, what's the last thing I... Oh, no.
[142:12.40]Did I get every... Did I do everything?
[142:15.96]Was the last thing that happened?
[142:18.90]Oh, no.
[142:19.18]I need to get the... Shit.
[142:22.67]Where is it?
[142:27.55]Oh, fuck.
[142:27.99]I gotta do this again.
[142:50.58]That was Dracula's bare ass.
[142:51.84]OK, one of the times it's the game over screen, but he's turned the other way and his pants are done.
[143:05.62]What's that worth to you?
[143:21.58]Let me just make sure I put this on because you never know.
[143:27.54]Maybe I had to have seen it first, right?
[143:29.30]Okay.
[143:29.62]There's one cube.
[143:32.80]We're good.
[143:36.42]So if you walk on this, you die instantly.
[143:39.36]Now, here's the thing.
[143:42.19]I know how to beat this.
[143:43.69]It's just going to be a pain in the ass.
[143:46.07]So the white one, two, three from the right is safe.
[143:53.16]One, two, three.
[143:58.31]I was so confident that I just didn't save it.
[144:22.70]Gotta do it in the right order.
[144:25.88]Come on, man.
[144:54.93]I should play chess?
[144:56.57]No, no way.
[144:59.43]That's one of those games I just cannot do.
[145:02.29]One cube.
[145:02.81]Got it.
[145:03.07]Okay, great.
[145:11.40]Alright, so what the hell?
[145:12.54]That wasn't it?
[145:13.12]I figured it was walk on the places that... How I miss my enormous feasts.
[145:22.12]when so many of my guests tried to cross the chessboard and perished impaled when the ground gave way under their feet.
[145:32.10]The system hasn't functioned for a long time, but the trap is still there.
[145:37.93]Only the right positioning of the pieces indicates the way to reach the other side safely.
[145:45.05]Chess is a game which ends with the king being put to death.
[145:49.87]Unless the pawn dies first, which is far more amusing.
[145:54.81]Okay.
[145:57.09]Um, well, what side of the board am I looking at?
[146:00.21]That's a, that's a big question, right?
[146:01.55]So, so I can, I can only go on this one.
[146:13.70]This one was one, two, three, four possible outcomes here.
[146:28.14]What Dracula doesn't know is he might have the power of chess, but I have the power of time.
[146:48.73]Okay, you can't... My theory is completely wrong, so... So I have to beat him in chess.
[147:00.43]Okay.
[147:01.71]It's this bullshit.
[147:02.91]Oh, I know what I have to do.
[147:04.37]It's going to be right.
[147:05.15]I have to pick this up and put this on the board.
[147:06.91]No, why do I have this board?
[147:14.19]And who took a bite out of it?
[147:18.74]Okay, so I just don't want to look at the green screen.
[147:21.66]I could sit here and understand this.
[147:24.41]This can move in any direction.
[147:28.95]This can only move diagonally.
[147:33.25]This can move one or two forward, right?
[147:38.13]This moves like an L. Is this a pawn or is that, what is that?
[147:50.35]Literally all wrong.
[147:52.25]Isn't this the Queen or the King?
[147:53.47]The Bishop.
[148:03.72]You got in every single chess piece wrong, what?
[148:07.66]I had guys last time I looked at a chessboard.
[148:09.16]I was probably 19.
[148:14.39]Bishop moves diagonally.
[148:19.22]This is the one that goes diagonal.
[148:20.42]What do you mean?
[148:21.08]That's not wrong.
[148:26.39]This is the queen.
[148:33.31]No, dude.
[148:33.69]I don't know how to play chess.
[148:34.63]I don't play chess.
[148:35.65]I know how to play checkers.
[148:37.83]And even that makes me angry.
[148:42.39]You did the chess boxing event.
[148:44.10]I didn't play in it.
[148:45.04]I was the C-3PO guy in the fucking ring that was like, oh, hey, everybody, and here comes your next combatant.
[148:50.70]I'm Master Luke.
[148:51.76]I didn't play the chess game.
[148:53.36]Go upstairs.
[149:01.60]Did you miss something?
[149:08.15]Oh.
[149:08.23]Oh.
[149:10.78]Nice.
[149:12.30]There's the cube.
[149:14.10]That's all I got to do.
[149:15.48]One cube.
[149:16.12]Wait.
[149:34.69]Give me this.
[149:37.39]No, give me that.
[149:39.11]Open the book.
[149:45.99]What on Earth is this the solution to every puzzle?
[149:48.27]Wait, this is what?
[149:52.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[149:54.66]There was a blank ass page on this that explained how to do this puzzle.
[150:01.82]I was desperately trying to understand how this worked.
[150:05.44]And it's just the entire IKEA instructions are on a blank page.
[150:13.50]Oh my God.
[150:14.48]I just thought this is why would this be anything?
[150:25.66]OK.
[150:27.84]So.
[150:34.45]One cube.
[150:36.25]Second number.
[150:38.38]I gotta find two.
[150:39.10]So two.
[150:41.78]Two is... Three is, um, weird triangle.
[150:49.19]How do I get to two?
[150:51.77]Oh my god, I'm gonna freak out.
[151:09.07]No.
[151:10.75]No, there's a two right there.
[151:12.29]No.
[151:22.86]Three is the what is that?
[151:28.18]Free is this thing.
[151:45.89]Bro.
[151:51.57]Three OK, that's correct.
[151:57.17]No.
[152:02.37]No.
[152:04.64]No.
[152:10.74]Didn't even do anything.
[152:13.68]Like the bottom right?
[152:18.04]ball bottom right it's weird it's like you have to pick the one specific okay two is ball three is weird triangle thing three is this it's a ball then this so it's um square ball weird triangle thing
[152:49.30]Just click on the shapes.
[152:54.18]I thought I could put it.
[152:55.17]Oh my God.
[152:55.93]You're right.
[152:57.13]Okay.
[152:57.47]Whatever.
[153:02.11]Well, I understand the puzzle and I was doing it perfectly fine.
[153:05.12]It's just, it's a weird clicky game.
[153:06.90]Okay.
[153:08.68]Uh, four, uh, four is the star.
[153:14.89]So it's square.
[153:17.00]Ball.
[153:18.08]We're triangle thing star.
[153:24.02]They stay depressed when I go over there.
[153:28.31]Square.
[153:28.71]I think they do square ball.
[153:32.29]Wait, there's two balls.
[153:34.61]Oh.
[153:40.53]Square, I think it's this one, right?
[153:43.65]Square ball weird triangle thing.
[153:48.18]Star.
[153:55.48]Excellent.
[154:02.08]The.
[154:03.26]Train station sign.
[154:13.34]Or an electric pole or something?
[154:16.01]Power lines.
[154:16.61]Yeah.
[154:17.09]Train station sign.
[154:20.29]Remind me to eat some meat tonight.
[154:31.65]What do I do with this?
[154:43.05]I'm so glad I saved it because I didn't mean to click that.
[154:45.41]Okay, so I can't step on any of these.
[155:03.99]I've done all of them.
[155:12.14]Glasses?
[155:19.64]Oh, maybe I can cleanse this with the... I think I can cleanse this with the... cross that I have, maybe?
[155:49.70]Is zipline still there?
[155:50.50]Can I still?
[155:51.06]Oh, there we go.
[155:51.56]Okay.
[155:52.80]Oh, okay.
[155:53.74]I'm dropping.
[155:54.12]I'm dropping in.
[155:56.46]Hershey.
[155:59.92]Hershey.
[156:09.19]Gross.
[156:12.63]Coin with this.
[156:14.83]Okay.
[156:15.15]I got the coin inside of that.
[156:18.33]Now I can probably kill the witches or something.
[156:22.73]I don't know.
[156:37.94]That's it, right?
[156:38.56]I think that's it.
[156:46.40]How do I get out of here?
[156:47.52]Is the question.
[156:50.09]Uh.
[157:00.38]Yeah, they look like they look like Pokémon.
[157:19.64]Okay, well, there it is.
[157:20.82]Shovel.
[157:24.88]Spectacles.
[157:27.04]Yep.
[157:28.98]Okay.
[157:39.73]Coulda just placed it.
[157:47.93]Alright, so that was that.
[157:53.77]This is clear, so now what does that do for me?
[157:55.96]It doesn't finish my... It doesn't fix the chess game.
[158:01.30]Ah, I can go up here now without a problem.
[158:05.40]Okay.
[158:08.42]So now should I go up the stairs?
[158:15.86]It isn't open yet.
[158:17.05]Okay.
[158:19.79]What downstairs?
[158:20.43]Anything else down here?
[158:21.33]I think I did everything here.
[158:22.97]Go back to the chest room now.
[158:26.21]I think that's the only place I can really go.
[158:49.01]So maybe I couldn't do any of the chest things until I did all this.
[158:54.04]Oops, wrong door.
[158:59.16]Okay, we're back in here.
[159:17.03]Good.
[159:19.48]Now am I good to go?
[159:38.74]Okay.
[159:42.14]Save, save, save, save, save.
[159:43.68]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[159:50.41]Okay, so I have one.
[159:52.09]I feel like I clicked on all these.
[159:58.55]I wish I could use this somewhere.
[159:59.75]Wait.
[160:10.90]Oh, it's one of the... I already did it.
[160:12.44]Wait, did I do this already?
[160:17.66]Why is this... This is weird.
[160:18.54]What's going on here?
[160:21.31]Oh.
[160:26.41]This is how you activate the game.
[160:27.83]Uh-huh.
[160:30.97]Okay, so this wasn't even active before.
[160:33.89]Uh-huh.
[160:51.55]Did that give me pieces?
[160:56.58]What was that?
[160:56.88]What did that even do?
[161:00.56]Oh, it... So I actually have to play chess.
[161:13.99]Wait, what?
[161:25.40]uh okay so how do I move any how do I move I can't select any of these a like ae doesn't that mean move a to e move f to d I don't get it how come I can't do anything stop clicking away
[162:00.09]I need pieces.
[162:00.77]Are there pieces down here?
[162:12.89]It's definitely a code.
[162:13.80]It's not chess.
[162:17.82]Well, let me look at the, so what, let me see.
[162:22.90]So this would be, I can't say like D1 or like F6.
[162:28.35]I need numbers, don't I?
[162:32.52]I don't like the picture.
[162:34.00]Yeah, but I need numbers.
[162:38.30]They're each in one column.
[162:41.46]It's so simple.
[162:42.34]Is it, though?
[162:43.50]Like, how do I move a piece?
[162:50.77]Don't you usually have to have, you know... Oh, my God.
[162:54.01]I'm going to freak out.
[162:56.41]Match it with the book.
[163:00.35]If it isn't just only one axis here.
[163:06.16]Letters of, I guess, letters of each piece.
[163:13.24]So, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. But... It's not this, right?
[163:28.14]No.
[163:43.71]Make the boards look the same.
[163:45.24]Your papers are... Go from the bottom to the top.
[163:47.66]Letters represent how far across they move.
[163:53.14]A, B, C, D, E, F?
[164:01.67]I... I'm gonna lose my mind.
[164:03.23]Okay.
[164:08.51]So...
[164:11.06]How would I select this one here?
[164:14.19]Or how would I select me?
[164:18.09]It's going to drive me crazy.
[164:20.77]I need to get a new mouse.
[164:22.07]You know, okay.
[164:23.27]Those of you in chat that have a mouse where your right mouse button is so fucked up that it's so easy to press it.
[164:29.88]It's so gentle and so broken that you just, just by holding it.
[164:35.14]I didn't do, I gotta get a new mouse.
[164:38.12]Left to right in order.
[164:41.42]So I just have to... Okay, so there's no number.
[164:43.36]I get it.
[164:44.62]So then let's do this.
[164:47.22]I'm going to say this is A, B, C, D, E... So F, B... F, B... Um... Where the hell is this one?
[164:55.16]F, B... F, B... Um...
[165:07.89]F, B, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, A, B, C, D, E, H, E. Oh, shit.
[165:22.62]I got to write this down.
[165:24.14]F. You need to move the white one first.
[165:30.11]So I got to start top to bottom.
[165:35.99]Yeah, FB.
[165:38.21]I'm writing it down.
[165:40.27]I need to, I need to, where's my phone?
[165:46.06]Where's my phone?
[165:53.00]Ah, it's alright.
[165:54.04]I had, I had, um, I had a bunch of pasta.
[165:57.84]So I can, I'll just paint it in the pasta sauce with my tongue.
[166:03.99]FB.
[166:05.05]Um, I need a, I need a pen.
[166:19.45]A, B, C, D, E, F, F, B, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, F, B, H, A, B, C, D, E, F, B, H, E, F, B, H, F, B, H, E, A, F, B, H, E, A, F, B, H, E, A, C, F, B, H, E, F, B, H, E, A, C, A, F, B, H, C, A, E. Thank you, sweetheart.
[166:49.33]She just dropped off a fucking notepad.
[166:51.55]Alright, writing this down.
[166:57.65]F. B. FBH.
[167:03.96]People are writing it in chat, but I'm not looking over there because I'm doing this one on my own.
[167:07.86]FBH E. ABCDE.
[167:14.55]FBHE A. C.
[167:20.68]G. D. F, B, H, E, A, C, G, D. F, D. F, B, H, E, A, C, G. I'm pissing off people in it, whatever.
[167:48.00]I gotta go, I gotta do it again?
[167:54.60]What?
[167:59.12]Is that not correct?
[168:03.32]Oh, I need the paper.
[168:04.20]Okay.
[168:07.89]There we go.
[168:08.87]Now I can see how to cross.
[168:11.35]Let's go.
[168:21.73]Alright, is the up one, up two?
[168:29.05]That's not right.
[168:29.51]Is it upside down?
[168:33.54]Oh, where's the bite taken out?
[168:36.06]There's a bite taken out of it maybe in a corner somewhere?
[168:43.24]Because it goes black, white.
[168:49.99]That's not correct.
[168:52.40]what that's not correct and how could they alright so then diagonal that was a weird camera switch uh hold on okay wait wait wait wait now it's down to the left left
[169:21.50]Down to the B, E. Okay.
[169:27.33]Then diagonal left.
[169:33.83]G. Okay.
[169:36.81]Now what?
[169:44.52]Top right?
[169:45.72]Is top right just safe?
[169:48.36]That whole quadrant I think is safe.
[169:57.44]I don't know, man.
[170:11.34]You've done nothing but foil my plans, and I cannot bear to see you any longer, disabling my traps and passing through my defenses.
[170:20.14]Oh yeah?
[170:20.68]Where is he?
[170:21.50]Kinda got a point.
[170:22.56]I don't really have anywhere to go.
[170:48.23]I actually think I could probably make that jump if I wanted to.
[170:50.27]Um...
[171:21.71]Dynamite?
[171:26.61]Just pole vault over there?
[171:27.99]Ring?
[171:28.29]Medallion?
[171:34.59]Arrows?
[171:35.87]Oh, okay.
[171:47.32]What am I looking at?
[171:58.83]What do I do with this?
[172:12.08]OK.
[172:15.08]How do I activate this?
[172:20.54]Oh.
[172:23.56]I can use it from this far away.
[172:30.81]Okay.
[172:32.22]I made it.
[172:32.54]I'll just rush through.
[172:47.11]You never know.
[172:49.73]Could be stuff here.
[172:53.85]Now use the ring on it.
[172:55.51]Okay.
[172:57.47]Again.
[172:57.73]No.
[173:00.13]No.
[173:03.32]Yep.
[173:11.67]Okay, open the door.
[173:12.85]Okay.
[173:22.72]This might be the last... This might be the end coming up here.
[173:31.04]How do I...
[173:34.44]How do I board this?
[173:41.27]Not yet.
[173:41.69]Let's make sure.
[173:45.15]Alright.
[174:12.48]he's got a ski lift he is a count hopkins I'm delighted to see you again too do you know where mina is he's alive mina is presently in the master's ultimate refuge it's better known as the final sanctuary I must go there
[174:41.34]I was sure you would say that.
[174:43.52]I'll take you there.
[174:44.84]Let's take the stairs.
[174:48.47]Who the fuck is this guy?
[174:58.89]He's not gonna take a bullet for us.
[175:01.25]Alright, he took a bullet for us.
[175:03.96]Hopkins, you saved my life.
[175:08.86]I don't think it will be enough to save me.
[175:11.16]I've done so much harm.
[175:13.10]Better not talk now, Hopkins.
[175:14.78]I'll get you some help.
[175:16.66]No, don't waste precious time.
[175:19.58]Here's the key to the door which leads into the keep.
[175:23.50]Once inside, a lift will take you to the final sanctuary.
[175:29.08]Be careful, because God only knows what kind of terrible traps you'll have to face.
[175:34.42]Go and save Mina.
[175:38.02]Tell her simply that I wasn't as bad as all that, will you?
[175:41.89]I promise I will.
[175:44.37]Oh, I know you will.
[175:47.13]You're a man of honor.
[175:50.65]Okay.
[175:59.33]well um apparently there was just some goon that jumped out of nowhere I don't know that guy's never been introduced before that's the first time we've ever seen that character
[176:14.29]And he threw a knife at him.
[176:16.57]And I swear... If... We definitely don't kill Dracula here.
[176:21.89]But it's probably... Guaranteed that we kill that guy.
[176:25.52]And that's gonna be their... Kill the bad guy end of this game.
[176:29.08]Remember the last one was those witches, right?
[176:31.28]We got rid of the witches.
[176:32.12]We scared them away and we killed one of them or something.
[176:33.86]I don't even remember.
[176:34.44]It's been... Might as well have been three years.
[176:36.13]It was two days ago.
[176:37.77]Um...
[176:39.57]We're gonna kill that guy.
[176:40.67]And that's gonna be the replacement for the big culmination at the end, and then Dracula gets away and we have to kill him in the fifth game.
[176:46.43]We might not even kill Dracula.
[176:47.87]At all.
[176:48.83]In the fifth game.
[176:50.31]I have no idea.
[176:54.87]But, sad.
[176:55.93]See you later.
[177:01.55]Nothing I can take.
[177:07.26]Wait, am I just getting- Oh wait, I get back on the lift?
[177:15.17]ladder alright take the ladder and uh put the ladder here he gave you the key is that to this door I don't see an indicator for it I don't see a keyhole
[177:55.99]wait is it it's not just really okay I guess that is what I had to do whoa that's puke inducing what am I I don't even know what I'm looking at
[178:30.67]OK, so what?
[178:32.29]Glasses.
[178:49.66]Through the windows, yeah, I can't seem to click on anything.
[178:52.18]I got the last break of the nights coming up here in about.
[178:58.72]Take a minute or two.
[179:04.18]Because I bet you I get through this within the next 30 minutes.
[179:08.90]Maybe?
[179:09.14]Maybe 45 minutes?
[179:25.31]Oh, okay.
[179:25.83]I guess I had to climb up a little higher.
[179:27.09]Good.
[179:27.19]Good.
[179:32.64]Should I just leg drop him from all the way up here?
[179:35.04]That's got to be an achievement.
[179:47.61]Higher?
[179:47.93]No?
[179:47.99]Hmm.
[180:32.07]I can't even see that I that is blood is blending in black with everything else.
[180:40.48]Oh shit, there's an ad break.
[180:44.58]Sorry, just snooze it again.
[180:48.48]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[180:53.34]Gotta go quick, gotta go quick.
[180:54.92]OK, Canon.
[181:00.41]No.
[181:01.69]Oh, I didn't save it.
[181:02.71]This is not enough time to save.
[181:03.67]I'm going to save it here.
[181:05.05]Like here.
[181:08.05]I think I broke the game and got unlimited time.
[181:10.92]So we're good.
[181:17.72]Cannon.
[181:20.91]Dynamite in the cannon.
[181:30.14]No?
[181:30.28]Something later I bet.
[182:01.23]OK.
[182:13.50]They were running the whole time by the way.
[182:16.20]That was, uh.
[182:19.42]So they were running from me.
[182:26.71]Got him, we're good.
[182:27.41]OK.
[182:33.82]Shoot the cannon.
[182:35.72]I need three items to shoot the cannon.
[182:38.34]I'm going to imagine that's dynamite or something.
[182:40.53]I guess I don't even have them.
[182:41.35]I don't even have the items I need.
[182:50.95]I can't leave.
[182:59.11]Now I can.
[183:00.43]Thankfully, the game wouldn't let me leave.
[183:03.67]Alright, boards maybe?
[183:09.01]No?
[183:15.15]Bucket?
[183:23.73]I mean, this is definitely going here, but I don't know.
[183:35.66]Maybe back up.
[183:37.98]There's another.
[183:38.64]Oh shit.
[183:38.98]No, I can't.
[183:44.11]Oh, yes, I can.
[183:44.49]Okay.
[183:47.43]What about this other cannon?
[183:52.55]Beautiful.
[183:55.86]I bet you I get a piece of the cannon here.
[184:00.46]Thank you.
[184:01.60]Cannonball.
[184:04.85]Awesome.
[184:05.31]There's one.
[184:08.11]You get a 200-word essay due tomorrow.
[184:09.99]You don't know what to write about it.
[184:13.31]Um... 200 words.
[184:19.99]That's like two tweets.
[184:34.36]Although, hey, it can be really difficult to come up with a tweet, though.
[184:38.50]Sometimes shorter form is way worse.
[184:40.66]You can't just kind of... You can't just bullshit your way through it.
[184:43.73]It's got to be very direct.
[184:47.59]The teacher's going to count the amounts of ands and ums that you put in that paper.
[184:53.67]So, like, you can't say um, like, and.
[184:56.42]Get rid of those.
[184:57.94]That doesn't count.
[185:04.46]Alright, I'm going to take a break.
[185:06.08]This is the last break of the night, probably.
[185:08.27]Unless this takes another hour, which I doubt it will, but we'll see.
[185:16.37]Imagine writing um in essays.
[185:22.10]And he was um.
[185:24.00]He was like um.
[185:26.76]You get an F. You just get a big red F. I'll be right back.
[185:38.27]See if we can get through this in the next hour or so.
[185:42.01]BRB.
[185:51.08]I was just playing a song, but I forgot I didn't mean to do that.
[185:53.94]It's a great song, but it might be too loud.
[185:56.85]Here we go.
[185:58.23]Here come ads.
[192:15.34]OK.
[192:16.40]Let's see where we are.
[192:17.14]So I got the cannonball.
[192:18.00]Welcome back.
[192:31.79]Straight flush with.
[192:33.89]He's got a flush.
[192:36.37]Why don't you play BRB music?
[192:38.39]So on these old games specifically, sometimes the audio has to be cranked up, the atmosphere, and I can't adjust the desktop audio on the fly because going to a different monitor or hitting the Windows key or Alt tabbing, it's just a mess and it messes with the resolution on all the screens and it's just not going to happen.
[193:03.61]But yeah, typically there would be music and stuff playing.
[193:08.19]I could probably set it up to make it work, but I'd have to route it a few.
[193:11.95]And I'm just like, man, whatever.
[193:13.01]Let's just won't have it for a few days.
[193:16.15]Okay.
[193:21.00]So.
[193:25.38]I got what I just got.
[193:27.00]I got a cannonball.
[193:29.74]Now I need probably gunpowder and probably like a fuse or something.
[193:58.70]Not even the cannonball.
[194:10.17]Huh.
[194:14.59]Well... Bucket?
[194:22.66]Can I like ride in the bucket?
[194:26.24]Somebody says, you guys just kind of say things, huh?
[194:30.70]Yeah, they do.
[194:32.72]Oh, and I've tried.
[194:34.52]I've tried to tell them to stop just saying things.
[194:37.82]It doesn't work.
[194:45.66]This is like 75% of this chat is something that somebody ate 10 minutes ago.
[194:52.72]Having me rush to finish their school project for them or something.
[194:58.34]and random auto fill sentences on their iPhone.
[195:06.06]I've told I've said I've said fucking grow up, but it doesn't work right.
[195:21.56]I got another board, but.
[195:29.04]Hmm.
[195:33.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[195:44.15]Oh!
[195:45.83]Oh!
[195:49.21]We should look at that.
[195:50.97]Hmm.
[196:00.04]what did that do for me I don't know I'm just kind of in the hole now there is something oh cool alright what is it I got tapestry alright got the tapestry
[196:30.80]How do I get out of here?
[196:37.70]So now I can put that down and then walk across it with the board.
[196:40.44]Kind of like you put your jacket down over a puddle.
[196:45.32]Uh, no.
[196:51.09]Although if you put your jacket down over the puddle, you just go through it.
[196:56.11]It was something else?
[196:57.85]Did I miss something else in there?
[197:02.04]Goodness.
[197:29.16]now I can build the raft to go to okay that should do it boards then really really
[198:04.01]There's not another item down in that hole, is there?
[198:05.95]Don't even tell me there's an item down in that hole.
[198:11.08]I don't think I can use the cannon yet.
[198:37.99]Check the snow.
[198:38.69]Okay, I got snow in the pail.
[198:49.63]I never would have figured that out.
[198:50.69]I would have thought that I was going to drop an item down like a treehouse.
[198:57.92]So I have snow, a tapestry, boards, a cannonball.
[199:09.00]Snow is essential for cannons.
[199:13.42]Can you use the cannon with the snow?
[199:17.36]I can't combine anything, unfortunately.
[199:19.02]If it's on the right side, it can't be combined with each other.
[199:21.64]But these on the left side, this other submenu can.
[199:25.94]Which... I feel like there's a lot of interesting things to combine, but... Okay.
[199:34.93]Anything now?
[199:35.41]No?
[199:36.25]No?
[199:38.99]Should I dump snow down the hole?
[199:59.52]why that's true I don't know it's just who knows you could throw it down there and it was just enough liquid that melted the snow and the water level rose a half an inch how much to make you stream with a giant cone hat on uh 1.5 million dollars
[200:27.61]That's USD by the way, that's US capital.
[200:44.22]That's before taxes, yeah.
[200:47.27]I always told you, I want to clean 1 million for that.
[200:50.99]And if it's 1.5 million, half a million of that's going to taxes.
[200:56.50]So I want to clean 1.0 million.
[201:07.27]I have, there's no other slot for any other item.
[201:10.05]I have to be able to do this now.
[201:37.95]What?
[201:38.93]You actually put this shit on here?
[201:43.51]No, this is not a shooting cannon.
[201:44.93]This is a Minecraft recipe.
[201:50.77]What are we making here?
[201:52.45]Okay, I guess I just made Flint.
[201:58.46]Can I shoot it now?
[201:59.16]How do I shoot it?
[202:23.69]What goes here?
[202:24.41]Yeah, I can't use the matches on anything in the environment.
[202:47.98]Oh, okay.
[202:50.30]Here we go.
[202:50.64]This guy's fucking dead.
[202:55.70]Holy shit.
[202:56.50]That was brutal.
[202:58.62]Well, we killed that guy.
[202:59.52]Oh, he's dead.
[203:04.21]Damn.
[203:05.47]We obliterated that guy.
[203:06.83]That guy got annihilated.
[203:19.15]Alright, so I can't
[203:25.62]Do I need the other board from up here?
[203:26.86]Can I pick it up?
[203:42.32]Yeah, now that dude is not going to be in Dracula 3, you're right.
[204:00.60]Is there another board to grab?
[204:01.82]I don't see another board.
[204:02.72]Shit.
[204:35.94]Well, it's the point-and-click adventure of Roulette.
[204:38.70]Try every single item in your inventory.
[204:41.87]If it doesn't work... Then you obviously don't have the item.
[205:06.54]I don't think this is even another place to get an item unless it's in a weird spot.
[205:11.44]You can place the boards across there.
[205:15.51]Where do I get another board?
[205:16.83]Unless I'm just not seeing it.
[205:17.73]Maybe it's leaned up against the wall here somewhere.
[205:22.85]I can't pick that one back up.
[205:24.01]Unless maybe I can.
[205:24.83]I just was... This game.
[205:27.39]You even saw me hovering over it.
[205:30.18]You watched me go, I want to pick this up.
[205:31.96]Hmm.
[205:32.14]Hmm.
[205:47.17]There is a way more efficient way to do what he's doing.
[205:50.77]Save this.
[205:51.18]Oh my goodness.
[205:51.76]Okay.
[206:07.07]Yep.
[206:08.25]There we go.
[206:09.05]Okay.
[206:09.55]On to it.
[206:09.79]Is it a gun?
[206:12.86]What does he have?
[206:17.80]Uh, some type of puzzle ring thing.
[206:31.85]Let me just check if anything else is down here.
[206:33.93]No, okay.
[206:39.37]Well, I think we're getting close.
[206:41.63]I'm gonna make a prediction.
[206:44.35]Uh, we're probably gonna be here for another 40 minutes.
[206:58.72]But I'm all for it.
[206:59.38]I love this game.
[207:02.38]This is the inner sanctum.
[207:06.54]Dracula's inner.
[207:16.26]You have 26 minutes of the walkthrough left and I had 35 before I came back from BRB.
[207:22.08]So it's about 10 minutes per 30 minutes.
[207:24.83]It's been about 30 minutes since I've been like 25 minutes since I've taken the BRB.
[207:30.75]Yeah, so every 10 minutes, 30 minutes is like in my time.
[207:40.48]Put a card in?
[207:41.80]Oh, wait a minute.
[207:47.18]Uh, so can I just keep going down then?
[207:51.28]Oh my god.
[207:52.00]Oh my god.
[207:52.80]Oh my god.
[207:53.56]Oh my god.
[207:56.33]Hey, I can just keep resetting it.
[207:59.90]Have you seen anything?
[208:01.79]Anybody see anything?
[208:22.40]Um, why am I floating?
[208:31.93]I guess I think I did it.
[208:36.16]Mission accomplished.
[208:36.96]Alright, cool.
[208:40.54]I'm still floating.
[208:41.46]This might not be good.
[209:12.90]Alright, let's do it.
[209:22.91]I don't think I can interact with this yet, but we'll go this way.
[209:27.82]Just kidding, that's where I came from.
[209:47.96]Super creeped out right now.
[210:04.95]Another skull.
[210:14.24]Right.
[210:15.16]Um, okay.
[210:21.61]What the fuck are you talking about?
[210:29.07]Alright, so I can't go over there.
[210:30.71]Can I do anything else down here?
[210:38.95]I think these spikes are killing me.
[210:43.89]Okay, what if I hold skull out?
[210:48.35]You probably turn it off.
[210:51.62]I can't leave.
[210:52.28]Uh oh.
[211:15.24]Garlic on the skull.
[211:33.89]I don't think I can.
[211:49.66]What's all that?
[211:53.27]Go down the bottom and look at the stairs.
[211:57.61]Are these symbols?
[211:58.79]What are these?
[212:09.67]I wonder if this symbol's on this thing.
[212:11.01]Can I press them in?
[212:18.52]I don't think I can touch them.
[212:22.92]Memorize these?
[212:23.76]No way.
[212:26.91]I can't even memorize them.
[212:27.97]I can't even see them.
[212:29.17]They're so pixelated.
[212:41.91]Draw these on the notepad.
[212:50.06]Is it a one pixel problem?
[212:51.06]Let's see.
[212:52.15]One pixel issue.
[213:18.77]I don't know.
[213:24.08]Glasses?
[213:24.54]Didn't I try the glasses already?
[213:39.85]Step on certain steps on the way down, huh?
[213:44.57]Oh, wait a minute.
[213:46.87]Oh my god, what?
[213:51.92]How am I supposed to know which one of these to step on?
[213:54.40]Is there information anywhere in a book?
[214:00.83]On the...
[214:05.67]Here it is.
[214:06.57]Okay.
[214:06.69]Okay.
[214:07.07]Glasses?
[214:54.80]Some of them don't make a sound.
[214:55.78]Third one makes a sound.
[215:02.66]Fourth one makes a sound.
[215:05.52]Fifth one makes a sound.
[215:11.54]That did not make a sound.
[215:21.26]There are symbols on the... Oh, they got a lot clearer.
[215:26.55]Alright, the ones in the book.
[215:29.05]What symbols are in the book?
[215:34.93]Circle, three, note, Y2C.
[215:39.94]I'm going to say this is a word because I won't be able to remember that.
[215:46.18]Koipitu.
[215:50.46]Koipitu.
[215:52.20]Ko-pi-tu.
[215:53.44]Ko-pi-tu.
[215:59.39]O. P.
[216:00.83]2.
[216:01.53]O. P.
[216:04.64]2.
[216:07.72]The first three seem right.
[216:14.48]O. Yeah.
[216:17.74]O. P.
[216:18.35]2.
[216:19.27]3. 3.
[216:28.66]Okay, so it's these four.
[216:41.13]And it's a Y and a C. That's not a Y. But these two are weird looking.
[216:50.17]These two are just kind of messed up.
[216:51.07]There's two.
[216:55.87]Where's the Y?
[216:56.34]Okay.
[217:00.67]Wait, I think it's that.
[217:01.53]It's so blurry I can't see it.
[217:14.89]Is that the Y right there or is it the two?
[217:21.76]So is it the first four stairs?
[217:23.30]One.
[217:23.38]Two.
[217:23.70]Three.
[217:30.69]Or then.
[218:00.98]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... What's the last one?
[218:02.06]What's the last one?
[218:02.96]Is it 8 or 9?
[218:03.38]Yay!
[218:33.36]I don't know what the hell was going on that one.
[218:44.74]Hey.
[218:47.76]Got a trade for something probably.
[218:51.62]Alright.
[219:00.75]Is that it?
[219:01.19]No, something else on his head.
[219:03.59]He's a hat.
[219:04.17]Give him glasses.
[219:18.17]OK.
[219:20.89]Oh clever, alright.
[219:24.85]That's it in there.
[219:25.84]Now I got what is his handle?
[219:29.98]A very basic wooden handle.
[219:42.55]Go that way, hold on.
[219:47.65]Alright, don't miss any items.
[219:55.57]Are you hacking?
[219:57.41]Um... No, I'm just... I'm getting a little bit of help from chatroom detectives.
[220:03.72]Where did that thing go?
[220:22.83]OK, this is the second of the three hell rooms.
[220:35.61]That was so easy.
[220:38.07]Oh.
[220:39.72]Oh.
[220:42.62]Uh, this is in the book probably.
[220:49.22]It's not in the book.
[221:01.58]Am I turning on the fire?
[221:03.50]Okay, I need to turn all the fires on.
[221:05.22]I turned all the fires off.
[221:10.94]What?
[221:25.16]Okay, is this one?
[221:26.10]One next to the ball is the first one?
[221:27.48]We're going to the right.
[221:31.64]OK.
[221:33.50]So it's ball left of ball.
[221:38.12]No.
[221:41.55]Ball to left from ball.
[221:45.33]No.
[221:48.17]Ball.
[221:50.81]Ball behind.
[221:51.87]OK, ball behind.
[221:56.60]Right.
[221:59.44]No, ball behind left.
[222:02.83]Ball.
[222:04.03]Behind.
[222:07.22]I went too far behind.
[222:08.06]Ball.
[222:12.54]Behind.
[222:15.24]Left.
[222:18.92]Shit.
[222:20.20]Ball behind.
[222:23.03]The big one.
[222:34.92]Damn it.
[222:37.85]All fine.
[222:41.19]Left of ball.
[222:43.85]Yep.
[222:45.17]Left of left of ball.
[222:55.50]Left of ball.
[222:58.42]Right of ball.
[223:03.55]Ball.
[223:04.11]Behind.
[223:05.29]Left of ball.
[223:06.57]Shit.
[223:07.85]Wait.
[223:08.27]Ball.
[223:09.37]Behind.
[223:11.03]Left of ball.
[223:14.98]Actually behind.
[223:18.30]Really?
[223:18.58]Oh my god.
[223:22.76]Ball.
[223:24.18]Behind.
[223:25.00]Wait.
[223:25.26]This one, right?
[223:25.91]Behind.
[223:28.21]Left of ball.
[223:30.61]The one actually behind.
[223:36.49]What?
[223:36.75]Do you pull one more than once?
[223:42.40]Wait, that was correct.
[223:43.22]That one was... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[223:44.10]That was right.
[223:44.54]That one was right.
[223:46.96]Ball.
[223:51.93]Left of ball.
[223:52.77]What was it?
[223:53.45]I don't remember which one it was.
[223:58.57]Which one was it?
[223:59.51]Oh, fuck.
[224:00.93]I forgot.
[224:03.21]Why did I not understand that one?
[224:14.30]Right of ball.
[224:21.62]It was real behind, right?
[224:24.84]Yep, OK, real behind.
[224:27.30]Then right of ball.
[224:29.56]OK then.
[224:31.70]Big one.
[224:34.93]Yeah, we didn't get to see the death animation.
[224:37.53]You have to see it on YouTube.
[224:58.85]Is that it?
[224:59.19]Did I win?
[225:15.86]I want to see what happens.
[225:16.54]No, it's going to take too long.
[225:25.97]Holy shit.
[225:26.69]Okay, this is a weird one.
[225:33.11]Actually looks like SCORN.
[225:36.39]It really does, yeah.
[225:49.29]This must be me.
[225:50.78]Uh, OK.
[226:02.07]I didn't pick it up though.
[226:02.89]No, I don't have it.
[226:04.24]Dynamite.
[226:24.75]Not dynamite.
[226:26.89]Shoot it with crossbow.
[226:30.19]No, shoot with a regular arrow.
[226:34.33]Um... ring.
[226:41.71]And?
[226:42.35]So what?
[226:42.79]I...
[227:03.98]Did I?
[227:04.92]What just happened?
[227:08.58]OK, so it's turn this on.
[227:11.58]It's coming through here and I it's I. Do I shoot this?
[227:20.89]That's the one that's coming out of.
[227:28.37]No.
[227:37.70]I guess I have to time the shot.
[227:57.43]Really?
[228:01.60]Huh?
[228:04.68]Wait, what?
[228:16.29]It's opening.
[228:26.10]I can't seem to shoot when it's up.
[228:40.10]Use the ring.
[228:44.65]Shield?
[228:45.09]I clicked it.
[228:45.74]I've been clicking it a bunch.
[229:16.14]Can you shoot the top of it when it's raised?
[229:19.71]Okay, I got it.
[229:20.33]That was weird.
[229:23.63]So do it again?
[229:32.59]Is this a colonoscopy?
[229:33.87]What am I looking at?
[229:37.94]What am I looking at?
[229:55.53]There we go.
[229:58.69]See ya.
[230:06.60]The final one.
[230:08.14]I got them all.
[230:19.50]Okay, I've got all the devices now.
[230:23.87]Three handles.
[230:26.67]OK.
[230:28.99]Let's go.
[230:39.11]You good?
[230:50.46]Don't know what else to do.
[231:00.20]There are two more holes.
[231:02.84]Oh, there's one more.
[231:04.01]Where is it?
[231:25.22]Okay, so I've been down here, right?
[231:27.76]This one is the... Yep, I've been in this one.
[231:34.64]That's where I come in.
[231:35.42]Have I gone down right?
[231:36.90]I don't think I've been here.
[231:37.66]Nope, okay.
[231:41.90]Go up.
[231:47.08]Yep, this is the fire one.
[231:51.55]Have I gone right?
[231:57.08]Yeah.
[232:03.48]Huh.
[232:11.18]You figured it would be this way, right?
[232:15.73]Go back to the fire room.
[232:19.55]Really?
[232:29.51]That's not the fire room.
[232:30.35]Shit.
[232:34.66]Where's the fire room?
[232:46.93]I got it from here already.
[232:49.51]No, I didn't.
[232:50.33]There's a... Yeah, wait.
[232:54.03]I'm confused.
[232:54.61]Didn't I do this already?
[233:02.56]Dynamite.
[233:06.27]Ring.
[233:11.19]I'm missing an item.
[233:39.63]You get it from a podium?
[233:47.52]At the pyramid, there should be three draws that opened.
[233:56.70]Ay yi yi!
[234:04.57]Okay.
[234:07.76]No hidden chambers, right?
[234:09.66]No, we're good.
[234:10.34]So now I bring this back to the fire room.
[234:20.35]Looks like I can stack them.
[234:30.92]Close it up.
[234:37.05]And then dynamite.
[234:50.36]Huh?
[234:53.20]Is it wrong?
[235:19.50]You need another, you need a key?
[235:21.16]Top draw in the podium?
[235:22.90]That thing did not, I, there was no top, you couldn't interact with that top draw.
[235:31.14]No way.
[235:36.49]Need to get the handles again?
[235:37.51]Oh, shit.
[235:54.65]Am I going to make one big super handle?
[236:04.82]Let's cook this fucking thing.
[236:05.98]How do I do it?
[236:11.52]Let's cook this freaking thing.
[236:25.66]I'm going to turn the lava back on while I pull this again.
[236:34.28]Oh.
[236:46.91]Forge be the greatest handle that has ever known mankind.
[237:10.13]Dude, I got it.
[237:11.55]Let's go.
[237:17.11]Let's go kill Dracula's henchmen.
[237:35.89]Bad dragon handle.
[237:47.67]uh that raised where oh I think I know where that is hold on got it you gotta go back to the top draw oh
[238:19.83]You're full of shit.
[238:23.35]Oh, the three witches.
[238:48.26]that's not Dracula
[239:09.89]So you have passed through all the obstacles, the traps.
[239:14.27]You've killed all my servants, but you are too late.
[239:18.81]Mina and I are going to be united, and you can no longer stop us.
[239:23.56]Mina will be my queen forever.
[239:27.44]Mina, I beg you, say something.
[239:29.86]Don't let him decide for you.
[239:32.06]I know that our love is stronger than he is.
[239:34.02]I don't know any of these women, by the way.
[239:36.25]I don't know why they're naked.
[239:37.43]I swear I don't know anything.
[239:38.75]Body and soul.
[239:40.51]I walked in with them, but I don't know anything about them.
[239:43.17]Mina is mine.
[239:44.34]It is written.
[239:46.14]It's her choice and her destiny.
[239:49.62]And you cannot prevent it.
[239:52.07]Wait, what?
[239:52.33]Wait, I don't have a ring?
[240:19.96]What if I choose one of the witches?
[240:22.39]Can I choose this one?
[240:26.89]I choose you as my wife.
[240:28.81]Uh... Naked Witch 2.
[240:32.15]Naked Witch 2.
[240:54.39]Alright.
[240:55.13]I just was saying, I want no other options.
[240:57.53]Okay.
[241:00.15]Yes.
[241:02.51]Everything is coming back.
[241:04.37]So it was true.
[241:06.89]My mind is clearing and I remember now.
[241:12.64]I can see Seward and all those close to him who died trying to resist you.
[241:21.11]Should have seen the fail.
[241:22.97]We'll go back and see it in a minute.
[241:24.59]I have it saved before then.
[241:26.89]You can kill anyone who gets in your way, but you will never destroy our love because it is stronger even than death itself.
[241:34.32]That's enough!
[241:35.92]I will not tolerate this any longer.
[241:39.18]Mina, don't make this mistake.
[241:42.72]Come to me and together we shall be invincible.
[241:45.51]We shall reign over the world.
[241:49.87]I am offering you eternal life.
[241:54.34]No!
[241:55.52]All you have to offer is eternal death!
[241:58.66]I shall never follow you into this kingdom of shadows and desolation.
[242:03.33]You wanted to make me your wife?
[242:05.65]Your queen?
[242:07.17]You must learn that nothing and nobody can separate those whom God has blessed.
[242:13.85]Your treason is even harder to bear than death.
[242:17.85]You reject me.
[242:19.73]You dare to defy my authority in the very heart of my kingdom and at the risk of your life.
[242:25.92]Is this what you really desire?
[242:29.26]So be it.
[242:30.54]Since I cannot make you my queen, then you leave me no choice.
[242:35.68]You must die.
[242:38.10]But even when life has long disappeared from your body, I shall return once again because I cannot be destroyed.
[242:46.80]Immortality is my destiny, and you must learn that losing your life is the price you pay for refusing it.
[242:53.18]Okay.
[242:59.13]Uh... I'm gonna, like, press the ejector button.
[243:02.91]He's gonna go fucking flying.
[243:17.26]Do it.
[243:25.19]Ooh.
[243:37.11]Ooh, why are you standing there?
[243:42.12]What a weirdo.
[243:44.33]He didn't even care.
[243:44.85]He's gonna get hit by a rock.
[244:15.96]Do they all get out?
[244:17.14]They're all going to get out, aren't they?
[244:29.44]Oh no, they're all Wicked Witch of the West.
[244:32.06]No, it can't end this way, not already.
[244:37.00]The forces of evil are so powerful, why can't I do anything to stop this?
[244:46.76]Is this really the end?
[244:48.44]Is this a god?
[244:51.60]God just fucking struck that guy down.
[245:03.53]Wow.
[245:04.09]That was cool.
[245:09.49]It
[245:37.72]Wait.
[245:38.74]Okay.
[245:40.42]I have an ad break coming up here.
[245:45.23]I'm not quite done.
[245:46.69]So let's take one more break.
[245:48.05]I'll come back.
[245:48.49]I still want to do a few things.
[245:51.51]We're not quite done.
[245:52.03]There are no credits.
[245:58.74]Okay.
[245:59.10]Well, I want to do a few things here.
[246:04.18]The last beer will be tonight for sure.
[246:07.82]I'll be right back.
[246:08.64]Here they come.
[246:10.19]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[246:12.49]That was fucking awesome, by the way.
[246:14.03]And how is there a third game?
[246:15.23]Alright, beer B.
[248:57.42]I'm not back, but that's guaranteed points.
[249:02.18]Who voted yes?
[249:04.06]Those of you that voted yes just wanted to make it a reality.
[249:07.52]You just wanted it to happen.
[249:09.31]You were trying to manifest it.
[249:10.85]That's the easiest points anyone could ever make.
[249:13.91]Alright, bear with me.
[250:06.04]Hello there.
[250:06.56]Welcome back.
[250:07.98]Yeah, that was the easiest points anyone could ever have made.
[250:11.62]That was a masterpiece, I'd say.
[250:13.02]If you want me to rate the games so far, I would say the Dracula FMV, I guess.
[250:23.89]Oh, no, it's a 3D animated.
[250:26.59]I'd say Dracula 2 is actually better than Dracula 1.
[250:30.23]I think that one was a little bit more fun.
[250:34.18]The first one was great.
[250:35.44]Set the tone.
[250:36.02]It was amazing.
[250:37.30]I think that one was better.
[250:39.34]Sequel.
[250:39.94]Rare sequel better than the original.
[250:43.91]One was a little more zany, but I think two was a little more interesting.
[250:50.37]Shout out to this YouTube video for saving the stream.
[250:53.13]That's so funny.
[250:55.46]True, though.
[251:00.16]Hey, to all you, to all you gamers out there that make these walkthroughs, you don't know the good you are doing in the world.
[251:13.72]Okay.
[251:14.00]So I want to, there's a couple of things I want to do here.
[251:19.28]I feel like that ended very abruptly.
[251:21.36]Was that a true end?
[251:25.11]What happens if I don't do... Let me see if I do something different.
[251:29.05]I want to see what happens if I fail this.
[251:43.79]This is a cool area too.
[251:44.79]Look at how crunchy everything is.
[251:48.11]Everything is so dirty and crusty.
[251:51.81]You can't even make out Dracula's face.
[252:00.50]Dude, why are you doing the cuck ending?
[252:08.63]Uh... Oh, I want to see the other endings!
[252:20.27]Put it on Dracula's finger?
[252:21.87]I can't eject him immediately?
[252:23.09]No.
[252:24.50]I think I can only do that on her finger.
[252:27.22]Let's see, I'm curious.
[252:36.08]This is no cutscene.
[252:41.90]Okay, what if you put the ring on and then do nothing?
[252:50.38]So you put the ring on.
[252:51.98]Sure.
[252:54.30]True love.
[252:54.96]Okay, here we go.
[252:56.84]Okay.
[252:58.14]Now what happens if we don't do anything?
[253:19.78]Okay, so there is no other
[253:49.92]What if I die in the room of burning fire?
[253:57.39]Wait, whoops.
[254:03.55]Uh, do I have one further back than that?
[254:07.57]I might not.
[254:08.71]Actually, I don't think I have one.
[254:13.36]It's probably the same thing.
[254:14.22]You probably just get the, yeah, the dunn.
[254:21.13]I thought there was at least... Okay, I thought there were like two or three more cutscenes after that.
[254:27.93]So it just kind of ends.
[254:28.85]Alright, I guess that's it.
[254:31.41]I thought there was going to be a couple other cutscenes to watch.
[254:33.47]That was wonderful, though.
[254:41.74]It's getting a little late for people, I think.
[254:45.48]No credits?
[254:45.94]Well, we can just watch them, can't we?
[254:47.90]No, we can't.
[254:53.56]What was the dynamite for?
[254:55.88]According to VRJosh, I guess somehow I skipped a large part of the game somehow.
[255:05.31]I was supposed to clear the rats out of the tunnel and... I guess there's a few things that I just skipped over.
[255:11.99]I must have been so good at the game that I just blew through over those things.
[255:20.82]It's a puzzle to get to the credits.
[255:22.14]That's funny.
[255:27.72]You can burn down the manor?
[255:29.49]Oh my god.
[255:34.79]So there's a Dracula 3.
[255:36.05]We will be playing it.
[255:36.81]We will not be doing that over the next couple of days.
[255:40.24]I can give you a little bit of a tentative schedule here.
[255:44.18]Although, no, I don't have a schedule, but it's literally... Okay, it's tomorrow.
[255:49.60]Ster, Poke, Vinny, and I are going to play the repo.
[255:54.21]And then at some point this weekend, I want to play Monster Hunter.
[255:59.57]It's a...
[256:01.13]It's quite a few boys that want to play it, so I want to get to Max rank.
[256:05.38]You'll see a Max rank.
[256:08.24]Maybe multiple Max rank Monster Hunter streams over the weekend.
[256:14.70]I do want to play wow.
[256:17.28]I wanted to whaling caverns.
[256:21.89]Not Max rank, high rank I guess.
[256:30.67]So World of Warcraft, Wailing Caverns, Monster Hunter, and Repo.
[256:37.69]What about the Horror Game Night?
[256:39.59]I gotta set that up.
[256:41.55]I kind of got obsessed with the Dracula games, and I really didn't anticipate I was going to do, what, four streams of the Dracula games?
[256:51.11]So that kind of took the place of that in a way.
[257:00.55]Yeah, tomorrow it's going to be late stream tomorrow starting at 5 PM Pacific.
[257:06.12]So it's a late one.
[257:12.90]But see you tomorrow.
[257:16.74]And that's going to be it.
[257:17.76]Have a good rest of your night.
[257:20.71]Call your mother.
[257:21.27]Yeah.
[257:24.15]I'm going to exit.
[257:31.65]So I can just do this, because it's fine.
[257:36.58]Oh, here are the credits.
[257:38.28]You just have to quit the game to see the credits.
[257:43.28]I'm curious, though.
[257:44.30]Hold on here.
[257:46.02]Is it the Twinsons Odyssey voice actors?
[257:56.26]Recording and mix of voices.
[257:57.68]Talk over.
[258:02.42]Steve Cadler.
[258:05.23]David Gassman.
[258:08.95]Is that Twinsen?
[258:17.29]David Gassman is Twinsen.
[258:19.47]Wow, that's actually so cool.
[258:23.24]OK, for those that don't know, Twinsen's Odyssey is one of my favorite games of all time.
[258:26.12]It's a childhood favorite of mine.
[258:36.29]also the voice of rayman I think um I feel like the the mina that's also from um twinston right the actress
[259:03.19]Did Rayman speak?
[259:13.87]Speaks in three.
[259:17.19]Maybe I would do twinsons Odyssey on stream.
[259:20.31]It's funny, I'm a sequel weirdo.
[259:22.65]All of my time in any of the twinson games, which is a little Big Adventure.
[259:29.52]I never really played the first one.
[259:30.86]I only played the second one.
[259:32.81]So the whole storyline went over my head as a kid.
[259:35.01]I had no idea what was going on because it was a sequel.
[259:38.89]But I think that's the better of the two games.
[259:41.67]I know that's up for debate, but that's what I think.
[259:47.27]Yeah, we'll play Dracula 3.
[259:52.12]Add another time.
[259:56.98]And that's going to be it.
[259:59.53]Excellent job, all those devs that worked on this 20 plus years ago, whatever it was.
[260:04.36]And that's it.
[260:09.24]Okay.
[260:21.93]Thanks for sticking around.
[260:23.57]Look, we got our own credits.
[260:24.59]We can run these instead.
[260:33.81]uh is it 8 p.m uh yeah sorry 8 p.m eastern for repo it'll be 5 p.m pacific it is with the horseman
[261:02.90]It's crazy.
[261:03.44]I haven't been doing a whole lot of late, late streams, but I used to do them all the time.
[261:12.26]My stream started for the most part from 2016 to 2020, even into 2021.
[261:17.02]They started at 7 p.m.
[261:19.52]Eastern.
[261:21.28]I was always a late streamer.
[261:22.22]I was a night streamer.
[261:24.20]It was like 7 to 2 a.m.
[261:25.26]Usually 7 to 1 a.m.
[261:31.84]It'll happen sometimes.
[261:39.86]That's how you got all your viewers with insomnia.
[261:42.76]I had it too.
[261:43.38]That's why I had that schedule.
[261:50.95]I was up from at least till like three, four, five o'clock in the morning every day.
[262:08.33]Will we get a late night podcast stream?
[262:11.83]I feel like the wow streams have been that kind of.
[262:13.94]A lot of times those wow streams go till.
[262:17.08]Sometimes 1011 o'clock at night, least Pacific.
[262:35.09]What if Dracula had no teeth?
[262:37.64]Only gums with two fangs.
[262:41.00]Isn't that Nosferatu?
[262:41.86]Isn't that what Nosferatu looks like?
[262:51.91]Night is just so much quieter.
[262:52.85]Yeah, it's funny.
[262:55.87]You can sense the energy levels, at least over here.
[263:00.21]I started the stream at, what, 132?
[263:07.01]Around, like, what, two-ish?
[263:09.87]And around, like, five hours in, I start to slow it down a little.
[263:14.08]That's funny.
[263:21.88]Because there's a distinct difference between the first three hours and, like, the last three hours of the stream.
[263:32.97]It's kind of like 2022 again.
[263:33.59]Interesting, yeah.
[263:38.13]Yeah, I'm just having fun.
[263:39.87]That's all there is to it.
[263:42.53]I've said this a hundred times in the last two weeks, but if that's Dracula, that's Dracula.
[263:47.43]It might be WoW.
[263:48.09]It might be... I might just watch commercials.
[263:49.91]It might... I might just sit around and just talk about whatever.
[263:53.41]Never know.
[263:56.09]Just kind of whatever.
[264:04.64]It actually is kind of nice to have the energy be brought down, though.
[264:09.86]Because the super real talk on that is that as I've gotten a little bit older, I'm not really 25 anymore.
[264:16.64]And the super high ball of energy is just, I can, it's still kind of there, but it's not like I was when I was 27, 28.
[264:35.24]why aren't you 25 anymore time waits for no one but no I'm good though it's not that oh my god I've slowed down so much I can't do anything but I like exactly where I am right now
[264:54.03]I'll watch clips of old streams back in like 2017, 2016, 2018.
[265:00.50]And old videos.
[265:01.90]And it's just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[265:05.18]It's just like a soda can, like a rocket ship.
[265:13.00]It's crazy.
[265:15.79]You're not old.
[265:16.23]You're only 39.
[265:16.87]No, I'm not old.
[265:18.83]I'm just saying as those years have progressed, I don't have like the ball of energy of a 25 year old.
[265:24.11]39 is old.
[265:24.47]25 is old.
[265:24.69]Oh, I got news for you.
[265:33.80]All of you looking at 25 is old.
[265:47.51]Hey, when I was 30, it's like, I don't know.
[265:50.59]You don't feel that old until you get to about 35 plus.
[265:55.41]You're not old.
[265:56.97]You got your entire life in front of you.
[266:03.53]I started that YouTube channel when I was 25, 26.
[266:05.59]It's been almost 14 years.
[266:08.61]You're not old.
[266:21.99]I see people calling him 22 old.
[266:32.63]No more crack era.
[266:36.83]I mean, I made little jokes and references to it today.
[266:39.51]It's like the performance era.
[266:43.41]It was always just flying in hot air balloons and crashing through windows and
[266:55.20]Is this a mature audience stream?
[266:56.80]I think it always has been.
[267:12.43]You were doing this too much?
[267:16.74]The breakdancing era.
[267:17.92]Dude, those greens, the green screen era.
[267:20.10]I will always remember that as like one of the, and I'm serious too.
[267:24.91]Those green screen movie nights were probably the most fun I've probably ever had.
[267:29.74]in my whole life.
[267:31.38]Those are like probably top 20, top 15 of some of the most fun I think I've ever had.
[267:38.69]So that's awesome.
[267:39.47]I can look upon and Holly and I sometimes will get in our feeds just because it's just like, wait, is that a green screen video?
[267:51.25]And we'll watch it and be like, what the fuck?
[267:53.11]Oh my God.
[268:05.80]Yeah, I'm still here.
[268:07.26]I'm planning on going anywhere.
[268:10.92]At least while I'm just having fun.
[268:13.60]Yeah, and retirement.
[268:21.13]What is that?
[268:24.75]Why does it keep saying retirement?
[268:33.94]It's just what it is, what it is, you know?
[268:35.48]I actually think saying that and pulling the trigger on that and actually going through with that made me, I think, like doing this more.
[268:57.99]Pressure's off.
[268:58.55]Yep.
[268:59.39]Just turn off the pressure.
[269:01.63]Turn the... Turn the faucet over to the left side, right?
[269:06.59]It can drip out now.
[269:08.29]Doesn't need to pour out.
[269:09.11]Doesn't need to gush out.
[269:13.17]And that's honestly... That is mentally... I don't even mean that as, you know, the amount of content, right?
[269:21.85]I mean, I've streamed like nine of the last 12 days.
[269:35.56]So we'll just keep doing it for as long as I think it's fun.
[269:47.47]I've only been a fan for four months.
[269:49.03]Please don't die.
[269:53.25]I don't plan on it.
[269:57.23]But hey.
[270:00.59]Hey, live each day like it's your last, right?
[270:06.03]And I'm not taking that advice because, like, yesterday I just kind of... I actually didn't feel that good yesterday.
[270:11.63]I was like, oh shit, I'm not getting... This is not going to part two of feeling terrible, is it?
[270:20.53]I was supposed to stream yesterday.
[270:21.93]I was going to.
[270:23.50]But I'm alright.
[270:28.66]Wasn't necessarily a false alarm as much as it was... Eh, it was... Eh.
[270:36.15]But I'm good.
[270:42.47]Is it cool with you if I thank you in my 16mm film class?
[270:49.43]Hey, you... Let your talent shine.
[270:52.41]How about that?
[270:54.11]Let your talent shine.
[270:55.56]Clean diet, get sunlight, get a good sleep.
[271:03.92]Yeah.
[271:08.42]Yeah, take care of yourselves, guys.
[271:10.50]Seriously, do it.
[271:12.90]You don't have to go to the gym every single day.
[271:15.05]You don't got to run fucking 10 miles a day.
[271:17.33]You know, I got to eat fucking lettuce, tomato, and seeds.
[271:27.88]Let your talent shine is a quote now.
[271:32.67]Yeah, I got that from the graduation section at the grocery store card section.
[271:42.08]It's not that deep.
[271:54.33]Alright.
[271:54.65]See you guys tomorrow.
[271:59.85]Have a good one.
[272:02.13]See you soon!
