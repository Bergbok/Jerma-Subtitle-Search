[00:05.09]So hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:06.61]Welcome to Total Distortion.
[00:08.47]This is a game that just, you know, recently came out 20 years ago.
[00:14.12]And... This guy sure does talk a lot of shit.
[00:18.16]That's all I remember.
[00:19.18]Let's go to bed.
[00:20.16]Falling asleep.
[00:20.96]That's okay.
[00:28.17]The dreams are racing down the road.
[00:30.26]The winner will take over your mind.
[00:32.90]Stop the bad dreams from entering your brain with the dream gun.
[00:36.32]Okay.
[00:37.94]So my dream gun's on the right.
[00:39.14]I don't want that dream there.
[00:41.66]I seem to be... Okay.
[00:44.88]Well, this is... I'm like real fucked up right now.
[00:59.75]Oh, son of a bitch.
[01:05.72]It's hit me every single time.
[01:08.90]I didn't even get hit by that!
[01:10.64]It's bullshit!
[01:12.50]No!
[01:12.80]Look at my mental state.
[01:19.85]Can I counteract this?
[01:22.19]Minus 46.
[01:22.67]Holy shit.
[01:27.49]Index of books.
[01:30.51]Uh... There's a lot of books here.
[01:37.33]Let's go with Face Fun Book 1.
[01:41.14]It looks like a good book.
[01:42.78]I wonder what this is going to be about.
[01:44.00]I wonder what tale this is going to tell me.
[01:47.94]Oh, it's... It's in fact not a book at all.
[01:53.55]It's just some... Some guy...
[01:58.78]This is a good book.
[02:01.80]I like the part where the princess revolts against the aliens.
[02:06.38]How about, uh... Sledgehammer Fists.
[02:13.44]Battle Practice.
[02:15.26]That sounds like a pretty good book.
[02:16.36]It could be anything, right?
[02:17.68]It's, uh... This is... This is also not a book.
[02:23.93]So how do I punch again?
[02:25.19]Oh.
[02:27.34]Am I on the left or the right?
[02:30.13]I'm pretty sure I'm on the left.
[02:32.29]But I'm just, I'm dead.
[02:37.51]So the purpose of this whole game, from what I remember, when I was like 12 years old, is you have to make music videos with their crappy video editor.
[02:48.27]And then you have to sell them to people on Earth.
[02:51.31]Let's go ahead and have a car.
[02:56.45]That'll be the opening scene.
[02:57.57]Yeah, we're going to have the second scene will be some cement.
[03:00.97]Because, you know, we need to be solidified.
[03:03.01]We need to be set in stone.
[03:04.21]We need to make sure people know that we're, like, stonescaped.
[03:06.87]And we'll have, I guess, I don't know, this car stretching like a clay car.
[03:11.83]And then we're going to have guitars flying around like...
[03:16.62]Scene three will be pretty easy, too, so we'll have, like, stones to show how solidified and how stone, how rock solid we are.
[03:22.88]There's, like, a knife flying by, too.
[03:27.60]Alright, let's take a look at our music video that we've created.
[03:31.40]Dog Shit Burrito.
[03:48.37]Oh, man, that fucking sucked.
[03:52.11]Hamburger bun, peanut butter, cream cheese.
[03:57.85]You know, I love mustard on my peanut butter and cream cheese sandwiches.
[04:02.89]And, you know, let's go with a little strawberry jam.
[04:05.25]That's good, too.
[04:05.91]Let's go ahead and make it.
[04:11.70]You would have to pay me, like, at least $15 to $20 to eat this sandwich.
[04:17.08]I would not eat this for anything less than that.
[04:19.67]But we're gonna see how it tastes.
[04:26.53]This is gonna be disgusting.
[04:28.55]Milk, hot sauce, and, uh... And... And, like, Coca-Cola.
[04:39.02]Oh, God.
[04:44.05]How is that good?
[04:45.07]You want a lettuce sandwich?
[04:48.07]Do not come any closer, you know what?
[04:50.82]Fuck it.
[04:51.26]Guitar fight!
[04:52.70]I'm gonna pull up my guitar.
[04:55.16]Yeah, eat shit.
[04:55.88]We're gonna shoot in guitar.
[05:08.81]You are almost dead.
[05:10.62]The master asked me to give you one more chance to save yourself.
[05:14.38]Turn back now, or I will finish you off.
[05:17.28]That's bullshit.
[05:18.22]Or I will destroy you.
[05:20.06]No, fuck you.
[05:21.80]I'm gonna kill you with my guitar.
[05:23.20]I'm gonna do a C and then a B. Hit him.
[05:28.43]Hit him!
[05:32.07]Alright, so I spent some time in the video editor.
[05:34.03]I had a couple of sandwiches.
[05:35.59]I had the blueberry and sardine sandwich.
[05:38.43]And I started to feel a little bit more creative.
[05:40.47]And I decided, you know what?
[05:41.89]I'm gonna spend like three to four hours on making a new music video, which I did.
[05:46.31]And here it is.
[05:47.53]How could you pass this up if you were a producer?
[05:49.49]Let's go ahead and take a look.
[05:50.71]Do I bring the lights down, please?
[05:52.85]Okay.
[05:53.95]Enjoy.
[05:54.27]Alright!
[05:58.11]We're gonna rock!
[06:22.12]Mega.
[06:23.72]Now we're cooking with gas.
[06:26.14]Alright, let's shop this thing around.
[06:27.62]Let's make a sale here.
[06:29.04]Hi, I've called you before, but hello again, Stevie.
[06:33.36]Stevie Groovy.
[06:35.86]Thank you very much.
[06:36.64]I think we can possibly send it to you right now.
[06:39.28]Here you go.
[06:39.70]Please, come on.
[06:47.80]Thanks.
[06:48.30]I'll get back to you after I've taken a look at it.
[06:50.06]Come on, you have to like this one.
[06:51.40]I'll take that video.
[06:52.74]Yes!
[06:52.92]I'm not sure it's hit material.
[06:55.82]What?
[06:56.58]What?
[06:56.86]Hold on.
[06:57.96]Alright, she's gonna take the video.
[06:59.16]I don't think I've ever sold a video on this game before in my entire, like, 29 years on the planet.
[07:05.04]Hold on, okay.
[07:06.22]I can't... What's your offer?
[07:07.24]Okay, what's your offer?
[07:08.84]What are you gonna give me for that?
[07:09.66]Here's my offer.
[07:10.38]10 million?
[07:10.94]20 million?
[07:11.26]500 bucks!
[07:11.52]That's it?! !
[07:18.07]I kind of want to pitch it around.
[07:19.56]I mean, if she'll take it for $500, maybe somebody else will take it for $600.
[07:27.90]Hi, uh, you don't know me, but I just wanna say, how are you?
[07:31.08]We can cut to the chase here.
[07:33.10]I'm a big fan, yeah, you know that.
[07:34.75]I'm gonna send you a music video right now.
[07:37.27]And you let me know if you like it.
[07:38.53]And if you have, you know, if you have more than 500 bucks on your hand, then maybe you and I can, uh, you know, work together.
[07:45.43]Alright, let's go.
[07:46.03]Let's see what he says.
[07:46.93]I don't, I don't speak, I don't speak this, what are you saying?
[07:57.57]She just hung up on me!
[08:00.25]Yeah, Stevie Groove, send video to Stevie Groovey.
[08:02.75]I'll take the 500 bucks, please.
[08:05.37]Yeah, you've already seen it.
[08:08.08]Trust me.
[08:10.90]I know.
[08:11.76]I know it's not a hit.
[08:12.82]I'm aware of that right now.
[08:14.28]But just give me the money.
[08:15.92]Thank you.
[08:16.30]I will take it.
[08:19.79]She dropped her offer by $200.
[08:26.70]You telling me I've been spending $50 per call this past like 15 minutes?
[08:31.21]Just jumping around, shopping around my video.
[08:33.21]I've dropped like $500 in collect calls to people.
[08:36.62]The $300 fucking dollars she just gave me won't even cover the cost of these phone calls.
[08:41.74]How am I supposed to break even?
[08:43.28]You know, in this, in this economy.
[08:44.82]How am I supposed to break even in this economy?
[08:48.48]Thought you were hot.
[08:52.14]Guess what?
[08:54.62]You're not.
