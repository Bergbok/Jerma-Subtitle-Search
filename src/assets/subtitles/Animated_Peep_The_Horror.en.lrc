[00:00.03]I'm just going to read this.
[00:01.07]Had a dream last night.
[00:03.15]Jerma became like a mainstream celebrity by pioneering a new type of stream where he would play a game like normal, but every once in a while he would let chat peep the horror and put this like red and black pulsating mass on screen.
[00:19.25]Kinda looked like an AI-generated image.
[00:21.89]And the whole deal was that everyone who saw it thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen, but every time he'd show it, one viewer who saw it would die.
[00:32.94]It ended when he showed it on stream and dropped dead.
[00:35.69]The stream was left on for 72 hours to honor his memory.
[00:43.02]It was dead quiet with just his body and a slowly pulsating red mass on screen beside him.
