[00:09.08]Howdy, partners!
[00:09.84]It's me, Jerma, here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay live comp.
[00:18.58]Oh, I just was getting started!
[00:22.17]Whiskey.
[00:22.65]For the love of all that is sacred.
[00:33.72]I wanna go on, like, at least five killstreaks right now.
[00:36.64]Have to.
[00:37.40]Got it.
[00:37.86]It's mandatory.
[00:38.66]It's absolutely mandatory.
[00:41.10]It is mandatory.
[00:42.34]This guy's got two weapons.
[00:47.21]There we go, that's three.
[00:49.61]Oh!
[00:50.33]Coming from behind.
[00:50.85]Add a bullet on that.
[00:55.11]Let me get that one with my hit.
[00:56.37]Oh boy, oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[00:59.19]This is actually a good place to be.
[01:00.89]I can sit in here and I can reload the gun.
[01:03.63]Don't have to really worry about anyone coming through.
[01:05.17]There's some whiskey on the ground.
[01:08.09]Dude, don't want to be that drunk for this.
[01:10.26]Because it sounds like there's a lot going on out here.
[01:14.98]I've got to get to, like, at least five or six kills.
[01:18.20]And this guy doesn't even know.
[01:21.48]Ah, you don't even know.
[01:22.68]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:28.02]Just creepin' in the room like friggin' Slenderman.
[01:30.70]I'm at four.
[01:33.80]Right here.
[01:34.24]Bang.
[01:35.08]Oh, that was close!
[01:36.76]That was close.
[01:37.40]Show your face again.
[01:38.12]Did I get him?
[01:39.88]Oh, I did get him.
[01:41.36]This is five.
[01:41.86]Oh boy, this is bad.
[01:45.16]This is bad.
[01:46.12]This is real bad.
[01:47.40]People around all over the place.
[01:48.47]I gotta make this shot count.
[01:49.39]This shot has to count.
[01:51.07]It counted.
[01:51.85]It counted.
[01:52.17]I got it.
[01:53.19]It counted.
[01:53.89]Oh my god, that guy didn't even see me.
[01:56.58]How did that guy not see me?
[01:57.84]I don't know.
[01:59.26]I'm not going to ask questions.
[02:01.04]But I'm going to try to keep this going.
[02:03.34]There it is.
[02:05.19]Give me that gun.
[02:05.93]Give me this thing.
[02:06.55]No, I don't want this thing.
[02:08.07]I want to stay with the pistol.
[02:08.97]I want to stay tried and true with the pistol.
[02:11.35]Try to get to ten.
[02:12.91]Oh!
[02:23.82]Must pay attention to your surroundings, son.
[02:27.95]Pay attention to your surroundings.
[02:31.91]Pay attention to your surroundings.
[02:35.65]Let's go with the... No.
[02:39.45]I'm gonna try to do this.
[02:41.79]It's very important.
[02:44.58]There is a dynamite behind me.
[02:46.18]Guy throwing dynamite up top, right there.
[02:51.08]Seriously, you gotta get out of my face.
[02:57.22]It is a quest indeed, especially on a free-for-all map.
[03:07.83]It's difficult to do because people could be seriously all over you in every single direction.
[03:15.63]Let's get out here in this room.
[03:17.89]It's so scary because if you turn a corner and there's somebody just sitting there and they're ready before you're ready... Sayonara.
[03:24.33]You ain't gonna make it.
[03:26.05]Like that.
[03:27.15]That's exactly what I was talking about.
[03:30.54]What happened to my killstreak?
[03:32.46]I don't even know what this... I was on, like, four.
[03:34.08]Why does it say three?
[03:36.54]Well, I don't believe that at all.
[03:39.26]So... I, like, lost pace.
[03:41.70]Hopefully this is, like, at least eight.
[03:44.00]I hope.
[03:48.09]I don't know how many kills this is.
[03:50.45]I've lost track.
[03:51.31]It's like seven or eight.
[03:52.53]I don't know, but I need ten.
[03:54.31]Gotta get to that ten.
[03:58.97]Alright, alright.
[04:00.20]Just calm down.
[04:01.18]Calm down.
[04:03.90]Whip a knife at this guy.
[04:07.50]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[04:08.64]I'm in trouble.
[04:09.28]This could be ten here.
[04:11.78]Oh!
[04:13.06]No!
[04:14.42]No!
[04:15.22]I was at nine!
[04:18.99]I can clean this up.
[04:21.09]I'm gonna clean this shit up.
[04:23.05]Somebody call Billy Mays.
[04:25.05]Tell him to bring all of his oxy clean.
[04:26.81]Because this place is a fucking mess.
[04:29.55]It needs like a deep clean.
[04:30.97]Hide, hide, hide from this guy.
[04:35.63]Holy shit!
[04:37.01]What is happening?
[04:38.53]Shoot the guy next to you!
[04:40.07]You dipshits!
[04:43.26]What the fuck is going on in that room, dude?
[04:46.78]Look at it, everybody's in this room.
[04:48.90]Every single person was just in this room.
[04:51.12]Why is so many people in here?
[04:53.22]I had to be quiet for that one.
[05:01.54]There's no way I was gonna do that one while opening my big mouth.
[05:06.02]My big mouth.
[05:12.81]If they go for a kick, just do the reverse kick.
[05:18.65]God, the Derringers are so scary.
[05:20.61]I'm so scared to use these things.
[05:22.03]You get two shots at each side, and if you miss, it's over.
[05:24.96]You get four, but you know what I'm saying.
[05:27.16]You understand.
[05:29.18]You understand my stress.
[05:32.62]I'm under a lot of stress with the Derringers.
[05:34.98]What's that, three?
[05:40.47]What's that, three?
[05:41.77]Alright, cool.
[05:46.35]Just leave me alone for a second.
[05:47.49]I'm just trying to reload.
[05:48.51]I'm just trying to reload for crying out loud.
[05:52.84]Is that a grenade?
[05:53.46]Oh, not a grenade.
[05:54.76]A dynamite?
[05:57.44]I don't know.
[05:58.52]But we're going to one of the worst parts to go to because it's just out in the open.
[06:03.14]And this guy... I missed.
[06:04.68]I missed again.
[06:07.52]Okay.
[06:08.46]Okay.
[06:09.52]Chill.
[06:11.56]Getting close here.
[06:15.56]Seriously, fuck you, dude!
[06:17.08]Where are the Dyrangists?
[06:19.20]I gotta shoot.
[06:19.66]I gotta hit this.
[06:22.41]Get that dynamite out of my face, bro!
[06:25.67]Get it out of my face!
[06:28.59]I'm in so much trouble.
[06:31.42]Seriously, I need whiskey.
[06:33.30]Otherwise, there's no way I'm going to get to 10.
[06:35.76]I don't even want to open that box.
[06:38.27]I'm too timid right now to do anything besides just, like, chill.
[06:44.03]Someone's going to hit me from afar.
[06:45.53]It's going to happen.
[06:46.43]It just is.
[06:47.62]Accept your fate.
[06:48.94]I'm freaking out.
[06:51.50]I'm freaking out right now.
[06:53.44]I'm freaking out.
[06:59.55]Oh my god, I killed him!
[07:00.15]Give me the whiskey!
[07:02.54]Come on!
[07:05.40]I just, like... No!
[07:07.68]I was at eight!
[07:08.48]Fucker!
[07:09.68]One more.
[07:15.92]Come on, that guy's got, like, two health.
[07:19.00]I wasted three shots on that guy, and I'm not even gonna get the kill for it.
[07:22.58]Or am I?
[07:23.50]I am.
[07:25.60]Box, crate is here.
[07:27.38]Nobody around.
[07:28.88]Give it to me quick.
[07:30.74]Come on, before somebody comes in the room.
[07:33.36]Pump shotgun, give it to me.
[07:35.70]Let's get this done.
[07:38.30]Let's get this 10 kill streak done.
[07:41.01]What do you say?
[07:43.69]What do you say?
[07:45.03]Huh?
[07:47.63]What do you say, mate?
[07:49.57]Let's go.
[07:49.87]What do you say?
[07:55.27]I'm gonna do it.
[07:56.21]I'm gonna do it right here.
[07:59.01]I don't care where you come from.
[08:01.59]You snakes.
[08:03.43]Just like a snake, you gotta get a couple kills and you gotta duck away.
[08:05.83]You gotta duck away back to your home.
[08:07.73]I would open this, but I don't want to because I want to be sure that I'm gonna get this streak.
[08:14.06]Go back to my snake den.
[08:17.42]I see bodies.
[08:18.34]Fresh bodies.
[08:19.76]Yep.
[08:20.54]Fresh bodies!
[08:21.40]Fresh bodies!
[08:23.86]That's alright.
[08:24.98]That's alright.
[08:25.48]That's alright.
[08:26.38]I had a little bit of a freakout moment there, guys.
[08:28.38]Little bit of a freakout moment.
[08:30.10]Because I'm real close to that big 1-0.
[08:33.30]Give me that whiskey.
[08:37.30]No, heavily, heavily.
[08:38.40]I don't think it matters.
[08:39.26]It's not going to matter.
[08:40.10]I need to get a couple more kills here.
[08:41.18]There's a guy.
[08:45.23]There's a guy.
[08:49.57]There it is!
[08:50.57]I think I got it.
[08:51.71]I have no idea, though.
[08:52.84]I have absolutely no idea if I got it or not.
[08:56.28]Is the killstreak quest over?
[08:59.42]I hope so.
[09:01.00]I hope so.
[09:01.40]Because I really... Let's get it to 15.
[09:04.79]I did it!
[09:07.89]I did it!
[09:08.13]I got it!
[09:08.53]I got it!
[09:08.85]I got it!
[09:09.09]I got it!
[09:09.33]Hands up!
[09:09.83]I got it!
[09:10.61]10.
[09:11.09]Low left.
[09:12.27]Killstreak quest is complete.
[09:14.71]And that's gonna wrap it up.
[09:16.03]That's what I wanted to do.
[09:16.96]That was the goal.
[09:17.62]That was what I set out to accomplish, and I did.
[09:20.18]And yeah, Fistful of Frags, guys.
[09:21.28]By the way, hold down alt.
[09:23.84]For those of you that are wondering.
[09:25.08]Hold on.
[09:26.92]What the fuck?
[09:27.58]Alright, hold down alt.
[09:29.64]That's the tip.
[09:30.24]That's the strategy for the day.
[09:31.56]It makes your aim better.
[09:33.17]Alright, take care, everybody.
[09:34.69]Goodbye.
