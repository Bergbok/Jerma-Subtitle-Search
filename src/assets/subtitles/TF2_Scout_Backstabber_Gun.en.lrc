[00:04.67]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:06.27]Jerma here with the new Scout weapon, the Backscatter, or the Spy Scout Backstab Gun.
[00:12.93]Also gonna be using in this video the Cloak Device for the Scout and the Jumpy Jump Melee.
[00:18.35]So, if you put all these together, you kind of just turn into a spy, and here you go.
[00:24.79]If there is ever a place where this should shine, it's probably right here.
[00:30.34]Once they push the cart up a little bit to, like, right about here...
[00:34.54]Is when I could be able to come in and get at least a couple of backstabs.
[00:38.86]Just like a spy.
[00:41.24]Well, you know what?
[00:42.10]We'll get this guy too.
[00:43.70]Because we can.
[00:44.79]You know, why not?
[00:45.51]But I'm gonna burn.
[00:46.71]No, it's not worth it.
[00:49.77]I'm committed to this.
[00:51.17]I'm not going anywhere and I don't want to drink the bonk.
[00:53.49]I will take the burn damage.
[00:55.41]Because it's important that they get on this car right now.
[00:57.62]Like, right now.
[00:58.20]Okay, here we go.
[00:59.76]Here we go.
[01:00.38]No, don't kill him.
[01:01.96]Leave him alone.
[01:03.59]This is where we slowly just go like this and just kill this guy.
[01:07.02]Okay, good, good, good, good backstab.
[01:08.86]Good job.
[01:09.88]Now get out.
[01:11.38]No, don't get out.
[01:12.70]Bring this guy... No!
[01:14.30]You ruined my plan!
[01:15.78]My plan was to... Alright, everybody, we're getting up on this guy.
[01:19.84]Nice job.
[01:22.00]Okay, we're back to square one.
[01:24.17]I am not spotted yet.
[01:26.13]This pyro is looking for spies, so he's looking for me.
[01:29.93]Not turning your back now, are ya?
[01:33.19]Ooh!
[01:34.91]I probably would have got that kill anyways, if I had just shot him with the regular scattergun.
[01:39.77]Hey!
[01:41.33]You're under arrest!
[01:43.84]For backstabbing my friend!
[01:45.00]Okay, I need the health.
[01:48.68]And... back to square one!
[01:52.62]Use the jumpy jump, make sure nobody sees you.
[01:56.32]Good, good.
[01:58.79]Now we... we wait.
[02:02.75]Oh, I've been spotted.
[02:03.95]Oh, I've been spotted.
[02:05.27]But he can't get up here unless he goes all the way around.
[02:08.65]He is gonna go all the way around and he's gonna die.
[02:10.39]Hey!
[02:13.84]Get out of here!
[02:15.64]This guy's trying to come up.
[02:17.68]I've gone.
[02:18.10]Gone.
[02:18.38]See?
[02:18.82]Didn't even know I'm there.
[02:20.44]I made it out alive.
[02:21.18]Here's my new spot.
[02:24.62]Here's my new spot.
[02:25.24]Waiting for this heavy.
[02:25.84]There he is.
[02:28.53]Got him.
[02:30.15]Got him.
[02:31.63]Alright, watch out, soldier.
[02:32.41]Watch out!
[02:32.81]Watch out!
[02:35.23]Oh, boy.
[02:36.56]Okay.
[02:37.08]Okay.
[02:37.74]Okay.
[02:38.56]Okay.
[02:38.92]Where is he?
[02:40.14]I'm trying to... Oh.
[02:45.00]That's the rule.
[02:46.86]That's the rule.
[02:48.16]And he died.
[02:50.00]No!
[02:51.34]No.
[02:52.76]No, don't ruin this.
[02:54.51]Me and this scout.
[02:55.53]No, shit!
[02:57.17]No!
[02:57.49]No!
[03:00.22]He can't hit me over here.
[03:01.58]I got it!
[03:02.06]My charge!
[03:02.52]Come on!
[03:02.88]Come on!
[03:03.36]My drink!
[03:05.56]God damn it!
[03:06.12]The drink needs to charge right now!
[03:08.00]Charge it up!
[03:09.38]Come on!
[03:10.22]God damn it!
[03:15.81]You are not me.
[03:18.09]And you are gonna get backstabbed.
[03:21.57]And so is this guy.
[03:22.51]Okay, that's two.
[03:25.39]One thing I will say, when you use the Bonk, nobody ever, like, pays attention to you.
[03:30.11]Nobody ever, like, wants to know if you're still around.
[03:33.39]It's crazy.
[03:34.43]Right?
[03:34.81]Like, I feel like I am a Spy Scout.
[03:37.84]Because of the Bonk.
[03:39.42]Check this out.
[03:40.26]See?
[03:41.02]He knows I exist.
[03:42.90]He's gonna forget I ever existed.
[03:45.56]All I have to do is come back here.
[03:47.14]I'm using my Dead Ringer right now.
[03:48.50]I just used the Dead Ringer.
[03:53.76]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:55.89]Whoa, what is... Why are Pyros just appearing in front of me?
[04:00.21]Seriously, like, what the hell was that?
[04:03.39]Two Pyros just... Oh, geez, Louise.
[04:08.48]Oh, geez.
[04:11.76]Come on, let me get this guy.
[04:13.34]Come on!
[04:15.84]Well, I made it behind everybody.
[04:18.95]Can I be sneaky enough where I can get somebody from behind?
[04:25.25]You know, the best place... You know what?
[04:26.91]Screw your teleporter.
[04:28.81]You guys are gonna have to walk now.
[04:29.95]You're gonna have to walk.
[04:33.15]And once you start walking, that's when you're gonna get backstabbed by the Spy Scout Spy.
[04:38.37]Oh, fuck.
[04:44.67]Push it.
[04:46.13]Push it.
[04:50.01]God, come on.
[04:50.59]Let me get that one hit on him.
[04:52.33]Let me...
[04:56.85]Alright, hey, for those of you that remember, who remembers those old soldier paratrooper toys?
[05:02.74]The things with, like, the crappy parachutes on their backs?
[05:05.70]If you threw them in the air, half the time they would do what he just did.
[05:08.74]The soldier just turned into one of those right there.
[05:11.20]That was insane.
[05:13.00]Alright, well, anyways.
[05:16.34]Am I gonna be able to do anything up here?
[05:18.10]Or is this guy coming for me?
[05:19.16]You're gonna come for me?
[05:19.96]Oh, yeah.
[05:20.72]Nice try.
[05:21.92]I'll backstab your pyro friend.
[05:23.94]And then guess what?
[05:24.48]I'm gonna backstab your soldier friend, too.
[05:27.03]But I won't get the kill.
[05:28.73]But I won't get the kill, or will I?
[05:29.85]No, I'm getting this kill.
[05:30.83]I'll fly behind you.
[05:34.51]Anybody else up here?
[05:35.37]What the hell did you just kill?
[05:37.01]What did that guy just shoot?
[05:37.87]Dude, the new demo night terrifies the absolute shit out of me.
[05:44.41]It really does.
[05:46.09]Can we be frank for a second?
[05:47.71]This new demo night is fucking terrifying.
[05:50.91]Everything about this demo night is awfully hard.
[05:53.15]I'm just like talking now and not even paying attention to the fucking game.
[05:57.60]What do we got?
[05:59.26]Hey, pal, you're dead.
[06:00.66]Oh, there's multiple, multiple ones of you.
[06:08.11]There are more than one of you.
[06:09.57]They're everywhere!
[06:11.73]They're fucking everywhere!
[06:13.55]Dude!
[06:14.23]Alright, can we just... Can we just go over how far I just flew right there?
[06:21.58]Waaah!
[06:28.20]I'm okay with that one.
[06:30.42]You want to talk about a stair stab?
[06:31.72]That was like a mountain stab.
[06:32.88]That was a mountain jump stab.
[06:37.07]Watch out for the Demo Knights.
[06:39.41]Got our Demo Knights versus their Demo Knights.
[06:42.51]It's just a Demo Knight party.
[06:44.29]That's what it is.
[06:45.99]We're going to go this way.
[06:48.99]Don't need a drink yet.
[06:50.42]Now I do.
[06:50.94]Now I do.
[06:52.86]I'll see you later.
[06:57.35]I don't want anything to do with you.
[06:58.37]I just want to get behind your entire team.
[07:01.27]Is that so much to ask?
[07:02.43]I can see the shadows, I can see where you are.
[07:04.93]Holy shit, are you kidding me?
[07:06.81]Was this guy waiting for me?
[07:08.99]What's this guy doing?
[07:12.31]Well, in that case... Okay!
[07:21.42]Well, how long is this gonna last?
[07:23.16]That's the question.
[07:26.20]Okay, bye.
[07:27.58]Bye, medic friend.
[07:28.87]You're blocking me.
[07:29.97]You block... Two, three, four, five.
[07:35.41]We got a lot of people here.
[07:36.75]Let's just go back around.
[07:39.47]I know you see me.
[07:40.83]I know you see me.
[07:41.47]Now you see me.
[07:42.61]Now you don't.
[07:45.03]I told you.
[07:45.93]I told you.
[07:47.85]Confirmed invisible.
[07:49.65]If that doesn't prove it, I don't know what does.
