[00:00.77]Guys, it's very easy to be early when the stream starts normally four hours ago.
[00:09.26]It's easy to be early when you're four hours late.
[00:14.72]How are you guys doing?
[00:19.19]Doing well?
[00:19.91]Hope your day's going well.
[00:24.07]My day's going real well.
[00:32.46]I got out of physical therapy.
[00:35.90]Got some info.
[00:39.94]I'm a little tight.
[00:41.45]It's alright.
[00:42.59]We did a nice consultation.
[00:44.03]Find out what we're gonna do going forward.
[00:46.05]Now I'm gonna go two plus days a week.
[00:49.39]Let's go.
[00:58.42]Today, we're gonna be playing Incredible Crisis for the PlayStation 1.
[01:05.26]The reason why we're gonna do this is because this game is a short, albeit incredibly interesting experience from what I've told.
[01:16.20]It's kind of a rhythm game, but not... I think the whole game's just fucking weird.
[01:24.75]Because we're starting so late, this stream is going to be only probably a few hours long.
[01:29.98]So we don't go until like 12, 1 a.m.
[01:32.74]Pacific.
[01:34.34]And we'll be back tomorrow.
[01:36.36]But I did want to get something in here.
[01:37.64]I didn't want to just not stream today.
[01:38.94]I wanted to stream because I like streaming.
[01:42.44]I like streaming.
[01:46.06]Quick, do a funny grandma voice.
[01:49.38]What is it?
[01:51.99]That was perfect for what you're asking me to do.
[02:01.40]We got a wink.
[02:03.88]That was a le funny grandma voice.
[02:06.84]I can do a funny grandma voice, but that's not what you asked me to do.
[02:11.97]I had specific instructions.
[02:15.86]Wink for us already.
[02:16.88]Hold on a second.
[02:17.84]I'm getting there.
[02:18.88]Just wait.
[02:20.28]Just wait.
[02:21.00]Let people trickle in.
[02:26.62]Laugh, honey.
[02:28.12]Hurry up.
[02:28.58]You're a con artist.
[02:29.56]Hold on.
[02:30.10]I'm doing fine.
[02:31.76]You didn't ask me how I was doing.
[02:34.62]Hurry up.
[02:35.10]How was your day?
[02:35.94]I'm doing good.
[02:39.04]You want me to quell this whole thing for you?
[02:41.48]Do you care more about wink?
[02:43.60]Or do you care more about dog on screen?
[03:02.41]What the fuck was that?
[03:06.31]It was me being like... It was me like, chewing on my tongue.
[03:11.26]We're getting angry.
[03:15.32]I'm telling you, this thing's gonna get me in trouble.
[03:19.33]I was like...
[03:28.40]More blink than wink.
[03:29.40]Hold on.
[03:29.82]I got you.
[03:32.59]Hold on.
[03:34.61]There.
[03:35.51]Use it.
[03:36.81]Print it.
[03:37.29]Edit it.
[03:40.47]Alright, you guys ready?
[03:43.95]I want to say... What's the MOBA?
[03:46.53]What's the MOBA that they made and they patched it like 10 times and it got to a point where it was 1.0 and then they closed it?
[03:54.34]It was in something... Crisis in... Incredible Crisis.
[03:57.37]In... Infinite... What was... Infinite Crisis.
[04:01.41]Yes, that's the one.
[04:03.89]Yes, Infinite Crisis is the game that got into 1.0 finally, and then they closed the servers.
[04:11.63]Family Guy Online.
[04:12.63]What the... What are you talking about?
[04:13.95]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:16.55]You can make him move around.
[04:23.47]This is awesome.
[04:25.91]Here comes Incredible Crisis.
[04:28.65]Okay, it's the dog bones.
[04:39.50]Presents what?
[04:40.28]Who presents?
[04:44.20]Well, they present.
[04:44.86]But, like, it's developed by Polygon Magic.
[04:52.07]Music by Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra.
[04:57.09]This is on PlayStation 1, by the way.
[05:00.19]Is there a voiceover or anything?
[05:02.45]Please have a face.
[05:03.09]Two moons?
[05:08.59]One has Earth.
[05:22.34]Pick up the an-
[05:36.23]You all know it's my birthday today.
[05:41.61]What?
[05:42.05]Birthday?
[05:44.60]Um, yeah, that's right.
[05:49.08]I'll make your favorite dinner.
[05:51.64]It really is that family.
[05:53.64]It's 3D Movie Maker.
[05:55.35]Not again.
[05:55.91]It's the same family.
[05:57.03]Not again.
[05:57.51]Of course.
[05:59.37]Brad movies free.
[06:00.27]That's my reason for living.
[06:04.01]Happy birthday, Grandma.
[06:09.78]Ruff!
[06:11.48]I want everyone home early today!
[06:13.40]Who just opened that?
[06:16.87]Who just closed that?
[06:20.27]Take an ice cream- Michael got old.
[06:23.95]The story of Taneo, chapter 1.
[06:26.02]Goodbye, I missed it, whatever it said.
[06:33.88]Where's this- there's Tokyo.
[06:39.38]Okay, what are they doing with another earth?
[06:47.53]Am I daydreaming?
[06:49.65]Time to exercise!
[06:53.55]Wait, the office is- How many times- Teneo Dance Fever.
[06:59.05]Okay.
[07:07.48]Okay, hold on.
[07:08.88]Okay, everybody, let's do some exercise to relieve the day's stress.
[07:14.86]Let's dance.
[07:15.50]Press buttons and direction buttons as shown.
[07:17.92]Make a mistake, you're fired.
[07:20.51]Your skill level goes down.
[07:21.81]Perfect dance, your skill level goes up.
[07:23.41]This game cannot be paused.
[07:29.75]Push what?
[07:31.63]Push what?
[07:32.35]What is that?
[07:32.83]Oh.
[07:39.44]What was that wrong?
[07:47.50]I did it wrong!
[07:53.27]That's good, Teneo.
[07:54.51]Good job.
[07:57.19]Is this why it takes so fucking long for somebody at Comcast to answer the phone?
[08:10.93]Is this what people do at the office?
[08:12.93]Holy shit, I'm gonna lose.
[08:20.00]Hang in there, Tenayo.
[08:21.10]How am I doing this wrong?
[08:29.91]What?
[08:30.75]You're doing great.
[08:39.93]Uh-oh.
[08:40.91]What's on your resume?
[08:43.03]Oh, you know, I went to... I got my Master's in Business Engineering.
[08:45.67]Uh, I sold... What?
[08:59.68]I already love this game.
[09:03.28]Okay, now I'm killing it.
[09:07.88]Ugh!
[09:13.03]Alright, so when does the trapdoor open underneath the person that did the worst?
[09:20.75]You've pleased me.
[09:21.69]Back to work.
[09:22.37]Okay, well that was fun.
[09:29.95]They do this every day.
[09:33.06]What?
[09:34.70]What the fuck?
[09:41.18]Holy shit!
[09:47.09]Bowling Inferno?
[09:53.12]What?
[09:53.40]I thought we were dancing!
[09:55.74]Avoid the iron ball.
[09:59.50]In the distance, meter turns red.
[10:01.75]Run with X. Make sure you have enough energy drink.
[10:05.29]When running, use up and down directional buttons to avoid obstacles.
[10:10.17]What?
[10:14.32]I'm gonna be being followed by a ball?
[10:19.50]Wait, what do I have to do?
[10:21.32]I'm tapping, right?
[10:23.22]I'm tapping.
[10:26.81]I'm tapping.
[10:28.03]How much do I have to tap?
[10:34.71]I didn't...
[10:54.18]Avoid the iron ball if the distance meter turns red.
[10:57.94]Run with X button.
[11:00.86]So don't do anything until it's red.
[11:02.16]Okay, let's go.
[11:17.00]I have to have enough energy drink.
[11:20.17]Alright, I get it.
[11:20.75]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[11:21.53]Oh shit, I have to pay attention to that too.
[11:26.23]Alright, we're good.
[11:29.39]Alright, same deal.
[11:31.47]Oh fuck, it's gonna hit me.
[11:33.44]Alright, we're good.
[11:38.34]Got it.
[11:44.22]That was interesting.
[11:46.62]Elevator of Doom.
[11:50.47]First try?
[11:51.17]I made it!
[11:58.31]Phew!
[11:59.29]Uh, wouldn't the... Is it gonna open and the ball's gonna be there?
[12:09.97]Excellent.
[12:10.45]Is this an emulator?
[12:11.85]No.
[12:13.36]Oh, it's like trying to get me!
[12:15.64]It's following me around!
[12:21.77]Why is it doing this?
[12:23.97]Stop the elevator.
[12:25.19]Break it with X button.
[12:26.19]Stop it before the counter hits zero.
[12:28.87]Use directional buttons to avoid falling objects.
[12:31.67]Blue meter indicates breaking power.
[12:33.77]I'm confused.
[12:37.41]Stop when it gets to zero?
[12:38.49]Use directional button.
[12:42.01]Oh, okay.
[12:42.39]I get it.
[12:46.55]Stop it at zero?
[12:52.81]Mash A?
[12:57.07]Wait, stop it now?
[12:59.37]Who's dropping like pots and pans at me?
[13:10.09]People are throwing rocks at me.
[13:15.18]I can't laugh.
[13:16.58]Hold on, I can't laugh and play this.
[13:18.24]Hold on, it's too many.
[13:19.98]Hold on, I gotta get the... Fuck.
[13:25.39]Hold on, I know what to do now.
[13:28.61]I... Okay.
[13:42.02]There's a lot going on.
[13:45.42]Stop it.
[13:47.50]Break it with X. Stop it before it hits zero.
[13:49.90]Not when it hits zero.
[13:51.59]This is not a superhero movie.
[13:54.31]Okay.
[13:54.49]Here we go.
[13:56.43]I'll get this right now.
[13:57.13]You ready?
[14:14.16]Why is it not registering these?
[14:16.76]I'm doing it too fast again.
[14:19.79]There we go.
[14:22.33]I'm literally pressing it too fast for it to register.
[14:24.23]Yeah, I'm good.
[14:32.31]Yeah.
[14:33.05]I was going like... Like, you know, I can do it and the game wouldn't register it.
[14:37.10]Am I dead?
[14:47.09]Again?
[14:47.43]Oh my god.
[15:02.00]We don't want to register this shit.
[15:05.00]It's still following me.
[15:12.51]It's still trying to kill me.
[15:21.04]What the fuck is going on there?
[15:35.23]Am I gonna be alright?
[15:36.03]Nerd.
[15:41.34]Nerd.
[15:48.90]Nerd on a wire?
[15:50.94]Okay, now what?
[15:54.22]Cross to safety.
[15:55.18]Press and hold X button to move towards the green zone.
[15:57.88]If you lose balance, recover with directional buttons.
[16:00.64]Pull will snap when the time is up.
[16:08.82]Uh... What?
[16:11.69]I'm already gone.
[16:14.05]Oh, I get it.
[16:14.55]Okay.
[16:18.38]40 milliseconds?
[16:19.12]50 milliseconds?
[16:21.52]What's this milliseconds?
[16:26.08]What?
[16:26.38]Get in the middle.
[16:30.43]Alright, I'm good.
[16:34.37]Oh, god damn it.
[16:35.51]I try- you have to hold- Oh, fuck.
[16:40.23]It's gonna happen again.
[16:40.83]Okay, fine, I'm fine.
[16:41.89]It's Tony Hawk manual, except sideways.
[16:47.79]We're good.
[16:50.66]I feel like I'm letting that go when it's supposed to.
[16:55.04]Come on, get over here.
[16:58.00]This thing's gonna snap, isn't it?
[17:01.14]Now what?
[17:02.72]What the fuck?!
[17:07.87]He's trying... He's holding!
[17:10.25]He's trying to hold it.
[17:11.85]Come on, hold it for like another one more time.
[17:13.57]Ugh.
[17:26.53]That's a lot harder than it looks, trust me.
[17:28.97]Trust me, I'm really good at Tiger Woods Golf.
[17:31.70]Holy shit.
[17:34.98]Okay.
[17:37.00]That's harder than you think it is.
[17:44.26]But guys, I get a perfect drive in Tiger Woods every time.
[17:47.57]Trust me, this is much harder than you think it is.
[17:49.29]Am I good?
[18:03.03]Hey, no!
[18:03.75]What?
[18:03.93]Is there a gust of wind?
[18:04.75]I... I'm fucking trying.
[18:13.93]I didn't get it once.
[18:14.77]No, I didn't.
[18:15.23]Because it's really weird.
[18:18.57]It's either too much or too little.
[18:19.91]This game's running... It's not even at... Let's take 20 FPS.
[18:23.69]I'm not getting all the exact frames that I need.
[18:35.06]Alright, we're good.
[18:37.34]Nope.
[18:40.87]Look at that mocap acting.
[18:41.95]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[18:56.21]Alright, that was... Oh, no.
[18:58.93]I got an A in bowling, an A in dancing, and a C in an elevator, and a D on Nerd on a Wire.
[19:08.33]That's not good.
[19:08.95]Oh, um, there's a PlayStation 2 memory card.
[19:23.81]Right.
[19:25.59]My PS1... I don't know where it is.
[19:27.59]This game's like three hours long.
[19:28.89]Don't worry.
[19:29.17]We're gonna beat it.
[19:35.44]Story of Teneo Chapter 2.
[19:37.48]Five seconds to what?
[19:44.72]Where's that memory card?
[19:47.00]Where's that fucking memory card?
[19:49.90]Is it inside the PS1?
[19:52.48]I'll check it out.
[19:53.54]Paramedics, the A team.

[20:03.66]Hold on.
[20:04.30]Answer the questions.
[20:05.70]Press X for yes or O for no.
[20:08.46]Ten correct answers are needed to clear the stage.
[20:11.16]Two wrong answers in a row will trigger an electric shock.
[20:16.66]Hey, listen closely.
[20:18.91]Is 47,326 an even number?
[20:22.63]Yeah, what?

[20:52.07]X is yes?
[20:53.73]Sport play by six people per team.
[20:56.37]Okay, I got it backwards.
[20:59.01]X is no!
[20:59.89]Oh my fucking god, I thought X was yes.
[21:02.33]Okay, I got it wrong.
[21:03.42]I thought X was yes.
[21:04.94]X is no.
[21:08.82]No, press X for yes!
[21:09.96]I had it right.
[21:10.62]What?
[21:13.80]X is yes.
[21:14.96]You're freaking me out.
[21:21.05]I live in America.
[21:22.59]I'm an American.
[21:23.97]When they start asking me about like 10,000 milliliters, I'm gonna get it wrong.
[21:27.37]Okay, here we go.
[21:31.77]Is Maine the northernmost state in the US?
[21:34.65]It's not.
[21:35.71]I guess I thought it was.
[21:36.99]Listen, what is it, Michigan?
[21:38.53]Is 21 an even number?

[22:42.56]Is 68 times 9, 610?
[22:43.64]I don't know.
[22:45.78]No.
[22:47.06]I can't do that.
[22:48.14]I seriously can't do that in two seconds.
[22:51.37]What?
[22:51.75]How many hoes are there?
[22:53.37]10.
[22:54.01]I don't know.
[22:58.69]Point A is 3 km north of the tower.
[23:00.37]Point B is 1 km north of the tower.
[23:04.15]Is point A 5 meters south of point D?
[23:06.63]No.
[23:07.85]I'm dead.
[23:12.17]I'm still alive.
[23:13.47]It's 1 plus 1.
[23:14.25]That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[23:25.65]Shit.
[23:29.33]I thought they were going to throw something in the end where it was like, it's 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 minus 10.
[23:35.18]10?
[23:35.34]You know what I mean?
[23:36.52]I thought they were going to do a minus on me.
[23:47.66]Is Maine the... No, I already know this.
[23:50.00]Guys, I've died three times.
[23:51.28]I can come back to life and get the same questions.
[23:53.01]We rewind.
[23:54.31]Is the currency of Japan yen?
[23:56.03]Yes.
[23:59.65]Hey, he's still alive.
[24:00.65]Is California the westernmost state in the U.S.?
[24:02.75]No, it's not.
[24:03.65]No, it's not.
[24:04.15]It's probably... I think it's Washington.
[24:06.63]Or Alaska.
[24:07.87]Is basketball a sport played by five people?
[24:09.34]Yes.
[24:11.82]Or Hawaii.
[24:12.30]Hawaii.
[24:13.24]Hawaii is all the way over there.
[24:14.56]Are the reindeer pulling a sleigh all female?
[24:16.12]No.

[24:24.67]I don't know.
[24:27.09]Hey, you okay?
[24:28.73]Is soccer played by 11 people per team?
[24:31.13]Oh, I don't watch soccer.
[24:32.63]I've never watched one full game in my entire life.
[24:35.62]It's 96... Can I... Yes.
[24:40.58]Hey, are you okay?
[24:42.56]An even number.
[24:43.36]No.
[24:48.89]I have no idea.
[24:52.03]I would need to write that down and do long division.
[24:55.93]It's 300 north of tower and point B, one of east.
[25:00.13]I don't fucking... I can't even read the question.
[25:06.88]I gotta get these right.
[25:10.46]Point A is... Point... Fuck!
[25:14.16]West of B and D is 200.
[25:15.82]Is the west tower... Is the tower...
[25:21.09]I can't read that fast.
[25:27.96]I can't even read.
[25:28.74]No.
[25:30.08]Yes, it is.
[25:30.84]No, it's not.
[25:31.30]I'm dead.

[25:49.26]Is that?
[25:49.60]No, what's?
[25:49.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[25:50.68]What?
[25:50.88]What is?
[25:51.16]Was that a two?
[25:51.86]I couldn't.
[25:52.48]It's like the blurry fucking line.
[25:53.98]I can't even read it.
[25:54.76]Do it again.
[25:58.16]Start over.
[26:00.66]I thought it was a plus.
[26:04.14]No, it's not.
[26:09.81]No, they're not.
[26:10.43]No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:11.35]No, they're not.
[26:12.02]Oh my god.
[26:12.80]Oh my god.
[26:13.12]I hate this one.
[26:14.42]They keep changing the questions.
[26:16.54]I think I have it memorized.
[26:18.10]But they haven't... Fuck it, they changed it a little bit.
[26:21.04]I think I have it memorized.
[26:22.08]No, they're not all female.
[26:25.93]It just said are they all male.
[26:26.89]I thought it was the same question.
[26:27.87]That's why I didn't read the end.
[26:30.69]Yes, it's yen.
[26:35.63]Is the currency of Japan... No.
[26:41.96]Yes.
[26:43.98]Hey, can you hear me?
[26:49.53]No.
[26:50.01]No, no.
[27:02.35]100 minutes past 11 15 12 15 what what do you mean what are you talking about 100 no not is the tower height of tokyo tower 335 what how am I supposed to know how tall the tower is what is that
[27:27.62]I don't know, there could be a small miniature tower in Tokyo.
[27:32.83]It could be like a small welcome to like the miniature tiny Tokyo tower.
[27:37.33]I don't know what's going on.
[27:38.15]I've never been there.
[27:39.49]Oh shit.
[27:42.72]Oh shit, I gotta do that again.
[27:43.64]I can do the whole thing again.
[27:47.46]Alright, hold on.
[27:48.00]I can do these ones very easily, but I need to get that memory card right now.
[27:53.67]Oh.
[28:08.42]Eureka!
[28:09.38]I like this game, though.
[28:13.89]I don't know what the fucking Tokyo Tower is.
[28:19.69]I only know it could be... It's under a lot of stress.
[28:24.45]They can electrocute me with paddles.
[28:30.66]Just when they think... I think I got the answer.
[28:34.72]Alright, let me check this.
[28:35.64]Make sure it's actually going to read this.
[28:38.43]Me and my friend beat this with no memory card.
[28:42.67]I don't care.
[28:46.39]I'm gonna use one.
[28:55.43]What the fuck, dude?
[28:57.03]Easy!
[28:59.39]Oh, we had big bits come in.
[29:00.33]Hold on, yeah.
[29:02.73]I know how these ones work now, though.
[29:04.74]You'll see, you'll see.
[29:07.88]I'm interested, though.
[29:08.70]Now you got me interested.
[29:09.55]Uh, Phylactery Lich gave fifty-five dollars.
[29:18.37]Fifty-five hundred and fifty bits.

[29:24.69]Another marriage proposal!
[29:39.91]two in a row.
[29:40.45]Well, congratulations on the proposal, right?
[29:49.96]Hope it goes well for you.
[29:50.90]Hope you guys are happy.
[29:54.56]And I'm not going to say anything to potentially ruin it, because that's what happened yesterday.
[30:03.74]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[30:05.86]I'm happy to be your special boy.
[30:08.42]Well, no, no, that's weird.
[30:09.58]That's kind of weird to say out loud.
[30:11.62]Alright, here we go.
[30:12.20]Dance fever.
[30:13.45]I'm gonna get A's on all this.
[30:22.97]Let's do some exercising.
[30:25.39]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[30:26.89]Fuck.
[30:27.43]Did they change the song too, or is it the same?
[30:42.32]Good job.
[30:42.90]Can you please ask my wife to marry me?
[30:48.47]Well... I do like that you can't pause these.
[31:00.64]It makes it more interesting.
[31:04.44]I'm Han Solo.
[31:08.37]I think I'm pressing those at the right time.
[31:13.25]What?
[31:42.59]That dude on the right looks like Jerma.
[31:47.27]Pretty cool suit.
[31:52.75]No, I need to get a new suit.
[32:03.15]What color should I get for a suit?
[32:04.71]What color should I get?
[32:08.77]Should I get like a...
[32:11.98]Pink suit?
[32:13.88]No, no, no, no.
[32:16.00]Yellow?
[32:18.32]No, no.
[32:18.78]What's the one in Dumb and Dumber?
[32:22.36]Pinstripe?
[32:23.00]I don't know if a pinstripe would work here.
[32:38.83]Purple?
[32:40.27]I would, I would, a light, no, you just, I have people saying that because of the Joker, I get it.
[32:44.68]Um, I'd like, I'd light purple maybe.
[32:51.63]Do red, blue, green.
[33:00.27]Just trying to get to grandma, that's all I care about.
[33:11.12]Turn the brightness down.
[33:12.09]You think so?
[33:14.15]Is it too bright?
[33:23.97]Is it too bright?
[33:29.51]Maybe a little?
[33:30.57]Well, we'll take a look.
[33:31.34]We'll see.
[33:32.84]What do you think about this?
[33:41.70]Better?
[33:43.36]Look a little better?
[33:43.96]Oh, this part.
[33:48.37]This part kind of sucks.
[34:00.70]Here we go.
[34:01.24]Make it nice and easy.
[34:02.50]I know how to play it.
[34:13.68]Fuckin' TV.
[34:14.10]Here we go.
[34:18.22]Whaaaat?
[34:27.83]Turn off the pixels.
[34:29.49]Uh, I can't do that because this is a video game that was developed in... 2002 or something.
[34:37.50]Cover that TV.
[34:47.05]Alright.
[34:52.65]That was much cleaner than last time.
[34:53.81]I'm much happier with the outcome on this one.
[35:05.62]Do it!
[35:05.92]Come on!
[35:06.74]Do the line!
[35:07.28]Yeah!
[35:16.06]Alright, get me back in that ambulance.
[35:20.50]Get these questions right.
[35:21.76]Oh no, I forgot I have to do nerd on a wire.
[35:27.08]Shit.
[35:27.52]Alright, let me try to get this at least once.
[35:30.78]I can't get a D on every single one of these.
[35:35.98]Here we go.
[35:38.82]Dude, I'm telling you, this is fucking hard.
[35:41.68]It's very... It's gotta be exact... It's hard.
[35:49.00]Get in there!
[35:52.44]Finally.
[35:54.66]Okay.
[35:56.27]Alright.
[35:58.07]Got it.
[35:59.79]I think it went faster that time, fucks with you.
[36:09.41]Here we go.
[36:13.65]Shit.
[36:20.08]Come on.
[36:21.44]There we go.
[36:21.82]Alright, get to it.
[36:22.62]It's gonna be faster.
[36:23.86]Yep, it's faster again.
[36:31.20]Come on, hit.
[36:36.30]Ugh!
[36:41.14]Good recovery.
[36:41.80]Immediate recovery.
[36:44.02]Oh my god, that's hard.
[36:46.00]I can't imagine getting that every time.
[36:55.61]Whoa!
[36:59.10]Oh my god!
[37:02.58]You can do it.
[37:03.16]I know you can.
[37:03.82]I know you're capable of it.
[37:04.80]There you are.
[37:05.28]Here we go, game.
[37:05.90]Wouldn't it be easier just to... Yeah, it'd be easier to just wrap around the thing and shimmy up.
[37:16.27]Alright.
[37:17.13]It's time to save the game and let's get back in that ambulance.
[37:19.29]Fucking Alaska.
[37:22.19]The westernmost state.
[37:23.91]What is the westernmost state, then?
[37:26.25]Hawaii?
[37:27.21]Is it Alaska?
[37:28.19]No, it's Hawaii.
[37:29.23]Is it Hawaii?
[37:32.22]How far over is Hawaii?
[37:34.46]Select Data.
[37:44.67]Data 1.
[37:54.08]Oh, here we go.
[37:55.32]Five seconds.
[37:59.16]I'm gonna get this.
[38:00.75]I will do this.
[38:01.99]It doesn't matter if it takes me three hours.
[38:09.85]Why is it also east?
[38:12.41]That's what I mean.
[38:13.45]That monk ass, you know, it could be, it's east and west.
[38:15.95]It's the eastmost and westmost state potentially, right?
[38:29.08]Is one kilometer 10,000 liters?
[38:31.62]No.
[38:33.08]It's not liters.
[38:34.42]I couldn't even... It's hard to read.
[38:36.26]Is California the westernmost state?
[38:37.83]No.
[38:42.25]Is one centimeter 10 millimeters?
[38:44.87]It's not.
[38:47.85]No, 10 centimeters is one... No.
[38:50.45]An odd number.
[38:51.01]Did it say liters again?
[38:53.92]It's hard to read.
[38:55.24]I thought...
[38:56.74]Millimetres.
[38:57.92]Yes.
[38:58.63]It said millilitres?
[39:02.21]Is soccer played by 15 people?
[39:03.69]No.
[39:04.85]It's 11.
[39:08.63]Is 857 times 9... No.

[39:19.29]Hold on.
[39:22.25]I don't... I have no idea.
[39:23.89]How the fuck am I supposed to know?
[39:31.69]No.
[39:32.85]Hold on.
[39:33.21]That's a lot of subs.
[39:34.77]That's a lot of subs.

[39:58.88]100 community subs from Freddy Fred.
[40:03.12]Did you go to Hash House of Go-Go?
[40:05.34]And was it your favorite restaurant you've ever been to in your whole life?
[40:09.17]Thanks for the fucking 100 community subs, Freddy.
[40:17.56]That's ridiculous.
[40:21.50]Insane.
[40:25.52]I need confirmation of that, because you said you were going.
[40:28.24]But we didn't get the verdict.
[40:31.72]Drive the stretcher.
[40:32.74]Use left and right directional buttons to steer.
[40:34.66]Avoid cars and motorbikes.
[40:36.30]If you hit construction signs, you'll lose control.
[40:39.38]For a while, you're done when the distance meter reaches zero.
[40:47.96]Alright, don't hit any cards.
[40:53.93]Why does his voice get lower?
[40:59.27]Can I jump?

[41:27.09]Come on, stay good, stay good.
[41:29.11]Oh my god, how many times am I gonna get hit?
[41:32.39]I can't.
[41:36.88]Alright, settle down.
[41:44.12]Settle down.
[41:53.24]I'm not doing this.
[41:54.54]I hit one and it fucked up forever.
[41:57.16]I'm not pressing these buttons.
[41:58.40]Now I can press.
[42:05.09]Dude, how have I not failed?
[42:20.84]No!
[42:32.34]I can't, I just read the funniest comment.
[42:34.69]I just read it.
[42:37.09]And it's gonna stick with me for like two weeks.
[42:40.37]Somebody said... Why?
[42:43.05]What's with the America's Funniest Home Video Music?
[42:57.75]Or any show on Animal Planet.
[43:03.77]God damn it, that was fucking funny.
[43:08.51]Look at me!
[43:22.25]Oh, Freddy.
[43:22.87]Freddy said something again.
[43:24.51]I went twice.
[43:25.23]I got the blue cheeseburger the first time.
[43:28.08]It was great.
[43:28.82]And then the chicken and waffles the next time.
[43:30.46]My girlfriend loved it as well.
[43:32.86]Thank you for that wonderful suggestion.
[43:34.36]I didn't get to see the Betty White slot machine, though.
[43:36.68]Unfortunate.
[43:39.06]Unfortunate, but that place is awesome.
[43:41.26]I'm glad they took care of you.
[43:46.98]Wait, what?

[44:18.71]She will guide you.
[44:20.21]Find the points with X.
[44:22.73]Press X repeatedly to fill up the massage meter.

[79:52.50]Let me see.
[79:52.92]50.
[79:54.02]No, no, no.
[79:56.68]33.
[79:56.74]How much is a carrot?
[79:57.34]No, 140.
[79:57.42]44.
[79:57.48]There's a weird one here.
[80:00.04]What do we got?
[80:11.41]59, 33.
[80:11.45]Is there a 33 in here?
[80:12.14]There's an 11.
[80:12.50]Is there an 11 and a 22?
[80:13.04]There's an 11.
[80:13.60]There's an 11.
[80:14.06]Is the herb 30?
[80:14.56]The herb is not 33.
[80:18.04]All right, hold on.
[80:37.60]This is 33.
[80:37.88]I'm going to back in.
[80:40.62]Oh, I need 22.
[80:41.78]But get rid of the... Hold on.
[80:42.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[80:45.26]Get rid of this.
[80:48.11]Get rid of this?
[80:48.59]What does that make it?
[80:49.77]I want to press the other button.
[80:55.87]Get over here.
[80:59.39]Get rid of it all?
[81:06.08]fucking game over.
[81:07.82]Omega Law, what's wrong with you?
[81:09.14]I don't do math.
[81:11.98]I don't know a goddamn fucking thing about addition or subtraction.
[81:16.55]I use my hands and I'm 34, guys.
[81:22.99]I still, I use my hands and I turn 35 this year.
[81:27.63]Now you give me an English paper to write, and I'll get an A+.
[81:31.36]You put a number in front of my face, I will spit it out like Cheerios, like a fucking baby sitting at a high chair.
[81:44.61]All right, so we need to load.
[81:45.79]Let's load.
[81:52.44]Elementary school.
[81:53.90]All right, let's continue.
[81:59.44]I have to do the sneaking again.
[82:01.08]God damn it.
[82:11.89]Jeremiah, I'll switch with you.
[82:12.90]You write my English final.
[82:15.54]I can't do that.
[82:16.10]Alright, now I know how this one works, though.
[82:25.42]How do you do your taxes?
[82:26.58]I don't.
[82:27.94]I have a CPA that does my taxes.
[82:30.65]I don't do my own taxes.
[82:35.43]I do not do my own taxes.
[82:39.88]I have somebody that does that for me and they're a professional and they're hired to do so.
[82:45.37]I just come in with like an encyclopedia size like binder or shit and I'm like, this is all my stuff and please do it.
[82:54.51]And the guy, I've been doing it ever since, like, 2012?
[82:58.73]It's weird, though, because every time I go in there, there's this, I don't know if it's the, I think it's the guy's office is made differently or strange or whatever, but there's a conveyor belt behind him of clothes that, like, and, like, people come in behind, there's probably people that are doing their taxes there, too.
[83:16.90]I don't know, I guess it's, he keeps his clothes behind him?
[83:21.13]I don't know what it's for, but
[83:24.96]And I always just leave.
[83:40.97]That was a sneaky one.
[83:42.01]That was a sneaky one.
[83:42.99]I'll tell you.
[83:43.35]That was a sneaky one.
[83:46.16]I hope I don't get caught.
[83:47.56]No, go back.
[83:47.94]No, no, no.
[83:48.44]Go back.
[83:52.04]Uh, no, I have a CPI, so I don't... I can't do my fucking... Do you think I'm... I have to count on my fucking fingers, guys.
[83:57.83]Do you think I'm capable of doing my taxes?
[83:59.09]I'm a fucking hundred million years old.
[84:05.75]Well, Megalod, that was so funny.
[84:07.11]Thanks.
[84:07.35]I appreciate it.
[84:10.57]I'm glad you thought so.
[84:12.00]Otherwise, you would have not laughed, and you would have said, that wasn't funny.
[84:14.26]I didn't think that joke was funny, and I would have been like, fuck, I'm gonna try better next time.
[84:17.02]Thanks for giving me the confidence I need to do more of those.
[84:20.66]All right, why doesn't he walk down here?
[84:31.29]Now here's the full reset.
[84:45.18]All right, we have the one opportunity, right?
[84:47.12]Not right now.
[84:48.64]No.
[84:49.74]Is that on the next pass?
[84:51.50]This turns red, this turns green.
[84:52.96]Right when he comes down, it turns green.
[84:55.50]Green, green.
[84:57.07]Here it comes.
[84:58.31]No.
[84:59.55]No.
[85:01.21]This pass here.
[85:02.69]One.
[85:03.81]Two.
[85:05.95]Three.
[85:06.51]Four.
[85:15.18]Why are you playing weird shit from the 90s again?
[85:16.94]I don't know.
[85:19.68]I feel like it.
[85:37.27]Oh, you already see this cutscene.
[85:38.07]Alright, I gotta do math.
[85:41.94]This game is 50 years old.
[85:43.74]Hey, by the way, not even from the 90s.
[85:46.20]2000s.
[85:48.74]Just saying.
[85:50.42]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[85:52.10]5,000.
[85:52.98]I need to do big first, right?
[85:55.30]Let's go big.
[85:56.00]Big.
[85:56.30]Bear claw.
[85:58.08]I need to do something.
[85:59.53]Where's my CPA?
[86:02.15]Alright, now I need three.
[86:03.11]Let's get the four.
[86:05.91]Should I do the two fishes?
[86:08.37]Or just go huge?
[86:15.11]1355.
[86:15.13]Do another fish.
[86:16.05]645.
[86:16.17]Alright, 645.
[86:19.47]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[86:27.68]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[86:29.42]I need 645.
[86:29.68]That means I need... What's 220?
[86:30.34]220, uh... Plus 320.
[86:30.62]220 plus 320 is 540.
[86:30.86]Is there a 120?
[86:48.68]What do I need?
[86:52.12]Oh, that's over.
[86:52.74]Oh, shit.
[86:53.56]You're right.
[86:53.86]Okay, fuck.
[86:57.20]No, no, no.
[86:57.56]I want to take it out.
[87:02.15]Take the meat out.
[87:04.11]Take the meat out.
[87:05.53]Come on.
[87:10.09]Two, three, five, five.
[87:11.83]Did you do another fish?
[87:17.06]No, no, no.
[87:20.31]Is there even another fish?
[87:27.54]I can do the mackerel.
[87:29.82]Where's the second fish?
[87:35.10]Is it two fishes?
[87:36.78]Oh, there's two meats.
[87:40.63]Where's the one that's 1500?
[87:49.12]Now this is 4,000.
[87:51.50]Should I do one meat?
[88:00.03]Get the 44 and 11 in here.
[88:02.63]What is that 11?
[88:03.05]Where is it?
[88:07.23]What was it?
[88:07.63]It's like a little twig, right?
[88:18.84]Okay, dude, is this shit changing?
[88:20.26]2,300.
[88:21.04]Okay, wait, wait, I gotta remember this.

[88:31.01]I need another 2,000.
[88:33.19]2,300, but...
[88:52.23]650.
[88:59.27]Fish out.
[89:00.01]Take the fish out.
[89:00.95]You guys are going to have to help me with this.
[89:03.67]I can't do this shit.
[89:04.73]Not in 100 million years.
[89:07.15]Fish out, horn in.
[89:13.97]Fish out, horn in.
[89:14.95]300.
[89:17.15]Alright, I need 220 and then...
[89:20.78]Alright, bear paw, paw tissue leaf horn.
[89:25.44]Paw tissue leaf horn.

[89:30.01]Where's the one for 140?
[89:30.79]Where's the one for 140?
[89:32.61]I know it's here.
[89:35.79]Where's the one that's 140?
[89:36.99]I know it's in here.
[89:38.69]Oh!

[89:51.68]Bart?
[89:57.22]I'm fucking really, really good at math.
[89:59.66]Very good.
[90:14.59]I went to a job interview, and the person at the job interview, why is it so bright?
[90:18.90]I'm getting booed.
[90:22.15]The job interviewer asked me to do something basic like that.
[90:24.71]Like, hey, let me ask you a question.
[90:28.28]You have the job, I just want to tell you.
[90:30.24]You're the perfect candidate.
[90:31.28]You can write an English paper so easily.
[90:33.42]And look at these.
[90:34.36]I can't believe what you've done here.
[90:35.68]Look what you've done.
[90:36.64]I mean, just like for the sake, it's like the guy at the counter over there, the guy that's at the front desk, he can't even fucking do 220 plus 140 plus 300.
[90:45.87]You know what I mean?
[90:46.45]Like, what is it?
[90:47.01]Isn't that fucking hilarious?
[90:48.73]Be like, uh...

[91:19.93]To not have to do fucking an easy math problem.
[91:27.53]And then he would be, uh, yeah, we got the results back.
[91:29.87]You were fine.
[91:30.53]What was wrong?
[91:31.21]Why'd you do that?
[91:31.77]I'd be like, uh...
[91:44.08]Look, let me write you a check.
[91:45.86]For, you know, for all this nonsense that you've had to go through.
[91:49.32]I guess I'll have three checks here, Jeremy.
[91:52.30]You'll get the money if you can tell me what they add up to.
[92:00.34]The code the statue's secret... Oh, it was her.
[92:08.82]Atsuko and the golden pig.
[92:13.49]Play a tune.
[92:14.27]Repeat the robber's tune by pressing O, square, and directional buttons to the golden pig's secret message.
[92:22.22]Play eight times.
[92:23.32]Oh my god, this is so stupid.
[92:42.64]This is cute.
[92:43.16]It looks like OBS.
[92:45.25]Why is it going... What?
[92:46.83]I'm trying to... Is my directional working?
[93:11.55]Oh, you're gonna pull this shit on me.
[93:13.99]Got it.
[93:14.64]I almost got a perfect shit.
[93:42.40]It's alright, I got it.
[93:49.39]It's a little sloppy, but I got it.
[94:00.99]Do I get a cut of this bunny?
[94:13.19]What did I kill it with?
[94:15.29]What did I do with it?
[94:38.52]Right onto a snowboard, now that's awesome.
[94:40.46]That was unbelievable.
[94:48.65]Snowboarding with wolves.
[94:54.35]Probably going to have to dodge, right?
[94:57.64]Snowboard escape.
[94:58.48]Avoid attacks with left and right directional buttons.
[95:00.86]You're safe when the distance meter becomes zero.
[95:03.00]I'll just dodge.
[95:15.77]How am I supposed to dodge gunfire?
[95:22.45]Are they hitting me with bullets?
[95:25.41]Alright, this is... Awesome, uh, GoldenEye ends it with Force Down.
[96:08.21]Am I dodging these attacks?
[96:11.19]I just have left and right.
[96:14.76]They're hitting me.
[96:16.12]They're shooting me with guns.
[96:20.20]I don't have any, like, banana peels I can throw back?
[96:29.87]Don't hit the wall?
[96:30.69]Okay.
[96:33.51]I mean, it's hard to not hit the walls, because if they hit me with a bullet, I fly into the wall.
[97:16.10]All right, can we be done?
[97:22.04]How do you touch the wall?
[97:42.83]Stay in the middle.
[97:54.41]No, goddammit, please.
[97:56.56]Oh my god, this is gonna- what a disaster.
[97:59.14]I'm getting fucking juggled.
[98:01.46]I have no control of the character.
[98:13.19]No!
[98:13.93]No!
[98:36.54]They do a lot of falling.
[98:44.94]Sorry, you can boo me, that's fine.
[98:51.19]What is this dance that I'm doing?
[99:00.69]Oh.
[99:01.47]I'm not very good with this character.
[99:02.73]I'm not good at math.
[99:04.40]Not very good at snowboarding.
[99:09.73]It's alright.
[99:10.35]I'll get... I'll get an F... I'll get a D in this class.
[99:14.98]The enemy from without.
[99:16.20]Emergency!
[99:23.60]All fighters rush to the Tokyo Bay area.
[99:26.17]Oh, I have to cook dinner.
[99:28.21]Are we fighting aliens again?
[99:34.67]Wait, why is she going into the...
[99:39.58]I'm gonna fly a jet.
[99:46.92]Alright, looks like Top Gun.
[100:04.80]Little bumpy.
[100:05.38]Fly the fighter.
[100:06.24]Avoid obstacles with directional buttons.
[100:08.52]Fly against... Fly the fighter safely to the exit.
[100:14.14]This is a little bumpy.
[100:14.98]Alright, is there up and down?
[100:20.62]There is up and down.
[100:21.28]Can I tilt?
[100:31.26]That's not what would happen.
[100:32.86]This would explode.
[100:36.98]Okay, I'm driving against traffic.
[100:44.69]Stay in the bottom.
[100:57.15]Ugh, so far so good.
[100:58.01]I'm so wide though.
[101:04.20]Jesus.
[101:04.58]Alright, stay up.
[101:06.48]They're gonna go down now.
[101:25.34]I have to concentrate.
[101:42.86]We're good?
[101:43.60]Alright, down.
[101:52.95]No, they never go down.
[102:04.36]Just stay down the whole time.
[102:15.00]I mean, if that's not a bee, I don't know what is.
[102:26.30]Number seven, come in.
[102:28.66]A huge monster is heading towards Tokyo.
[102:31.19]Attack immediately.
[102:33.07]What is on the... Ruriko, what is she doing here?
[102:47.75]Bear Wars.
[102:53.45]Everyone is down.
[102:54.17]Number seven, you're our only hope.
[102:58.61]Stop the ferocious bear.
[102:59.85]Fighter is on auto-flight mode.
[103:02.73]Use directional buttons to aim, X to launch missiles.
[103:05.83]Hit the switch on the back of the bear eight times to clear the stage.
[103:10.93]Oh, fuck you, games.
[103:13.88]Um... Okay.
[103:16.71]Got it.
[103:18.79]Did I hit it?
[103:24.24]I hit it right?

[105:06.49]Ooh.
[105:14.20]Ah.
[105:18.78]Close to being over.
[105:23.84]One more.
[105:26.46]Quickly, turn it around.
[105:27.78]Quickly, turn it around.
[105:29.69]Turn it around.
[105:30.21]Come on.
[105:30.53]This is it.

[105:36.01]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[105:37.37]Come on, please.
[105:42.30]Oh, you're not in range.
[105:43.76]Turn.

[106:22.23]It's got the egg.
[106:23.84]Let's see this.
[106:26.90]Yeah, I could have done way more.
[106:28.32]Wait, hold on.
[106:28.92]A B and a C, you get an A. There's no A to be found on that report card.
[106:43.61]I believe whoever is grading this is being paid a very, very hefty sum of money to make sure I do not get less than an A.
[107:01.78]story of suyoshi chapter one oh it's the it's one of the kids wait can we just take care of this is this a are we going back that was not very good for that kid

[107:48.27]Wait, I'm tiny.
[107:49.47]I got shrunk.
[107:55.59]I thought that the bear was just drinking big-ass beers or something and throwing them down.
[107:59.42]I didn't think I shrunk.
[108:03.39]King of the Hill.
[108:09.23]Escape from the antlion.
[108:10.99]Climb up with X button while the meter is changing color.
[108:14.41]Avoid mudslides with left and right directional buttons.
[108:18.64]Use directional buttons if you get caught in a slide.
[108:20.60]The game is over if you slide all the way down.
[108:22.44]Alright, so...
[108:32.49]Am I doing- I have this right.
[108:34.31]Hit X when it's in the middle.
[108:35.27]Preemptive jump.
[108:41.58]If that was a preemptive ju- that would- I- What?
[108:45.26]Oh shit.
[108:45.74]You can't make me laugh right now.
[109:04.51]Just me, just somebody filming me from behind.
[109:11.05]He's even got the hair part.
[109:12.65]Come on, get up.
[109:36.86]Any very deliberate walk just turns into that, doesn't it?
[109:45.13]Spiderweb?
[109:58.58]Kiss of the Spider-Man.
[110:02.38]I hope we get a royalty-free Spider-Man.
[110:05.76]That would be amazing.
[110:06.46]Oh, I get it.
[110:08.54]It disappears.
[110:31.27]Okay.
[110:31.65]I feel like this is going to turn into a real pain in the ass.
[110:39.63]Don't say it.
[110:40.18]Resist.
[110:40.58]I'm not going to say it.
[110:44.98]Ah!
[110:45.48]So close.
[110:51.24]Something should happen in Mario 64.
[110:52.30]Got it.
[111:04.56]It's so slow.
[111:05.78]Ah!
[111:07.62]Ah!
[111:13.53]Enemy!
[111:14.13]Ah!
[111:19.69]No fucking way am I gonna hit that.
[111:23.87]Are you shitting me?
[111:38.56]Stop.
[111:39.20]Come on.
[111:42.02]He's turning.
[111:42.60]Stop.
[111:46.61]Oh my god.
[111:47.67]I have to get it.
[111:48.75]What the...
[112:17.49]I did it!
[112:21.93]Use your finger and trace it over the screen.
[112:24.03]Now that's brilliant.
[112:24.97]Too bad I didn't think to do that.
[112:32.94]It's alright.
[112:34.16]My parents are not going to be mad about that.
[112:36.00]The only D I got is Zed.
[112:46.43]You know why I got really, really dogshit grades in phys ed when I was in middle school and high school?
[112:51.23]You know why?
[112:53.79]Because I never wanted to bring a change of clothes to school.
[112:59.20]Because it was, oh, you change, and then you change clothes, and then you go to the gym.
[113:03.34]I don't want to do that.
[113:04.20]That was a pain in the ass.
[113:10.29]So I just didn't change, I just kind of just did things very slowly.
[113:17.78]And it was like, hey, uh, Jeremy, you got to change your clothes?
[113:20.96]No, I don't, I don't want to put clothes in my locker.
[113:25.04]Okay.
[113:26.66]Absent for the day.
[113:28.45]Okay.
[113:41.04]What have you done?
[113:41.66]Wait, didn't we do this already?
[113:48.58]They'd go nuts if you did.
[113:49.66]There was a big problem if you didn't change.
[113:52.22]I'm not a smelly person, guys.
[113:57.81]And I didn't... Alright, if we're playing... If we're playing... Like... Pickleball or something... I'm just gonna take it easy.
[114:07.21]I'm just gonna do it lightly.
[114:12.65]I would be... I was fine.
[114:16.25]You guys don't know pickleball?
[114:17.33]The greatest sport ever invented?
[114:18.61]But you guys didn't have pickleball.
[114:28.81]Everyone should know pickleball.
[114:30.05]Yeah, I agree.
[114:30.89]I'm shocked at this.
[114:33.17]That's like one of the most... It's like tennis and ping pong mixed together into one sport.
[114:39.57]I just made a bunch of new Pickleball fans.
[114:42.49]Some of you guys right now, what the fuck is he doing?
[114:44.12]Pickleball, you're gonna go watch a YouTube video.
[114:46.04]And you're gonna become like a Pickleball champion.
[114:48.06]You're gonna love it.
[114:51.20]Charlie, you're gonna love it.
[114:54.44]Alright, the same thing with water.
[114:55.82]We've got a clone minigame here.
[115:00.41]It's a clone minigame.
[115:22.83]Ooh, it's not.
[115:23.39]It's harder.
[115:23.93]Okay.
[115:24.59]It's the same one the dad did, except it's way harder.
[115:26.73]Of course they give, like, this job to the kid.
[115:34.63]I'll be honest, though.
[115:36.13]Is this, like, an old man?
[115:37.77]Would you rather have an old man or, like, an eight-year-old do this?
[115:42.95]That's tricky.
[115:43.59]I don't know.
[115:52.86]The old man?
[115:53.36]What if the old man goes down and it goes like... And then he can't go anywhere.
[115:57.96]He's done.
[115:58.34]Like, he throws his back up.
[116:09.35]But he didn't, though.
[116:10.53]Yeah.
[116:13.65]I guess that's true.
[116:16.19]If he's not getting hurt by...
[116:19.16]Getting thrown out of the boat a thousand times.
[116:20.76]Okay, we gotta move.
[116:22.14]We gotta move now!
[116:22.90]We gotta move now!
[116:33.52]Come on, hit!
[116:52.97]Alright, this boat's going great.
[116:58.25]You motherfucker!
[117:08.58]That guy, like, just double tapped.
[117:20.09]Get this fucking boat moving, dude!
[117:21.92]Get this fucking boat move!
[117:24.44]Alright, I got it.
[117:49.74]Dude, but how do you get away from this fucking guy dumping on you?
[118:02.00]Back to it.
[118:14.05]Efficiency is more important.
[118:15.69]Let's get three.
[118:30.84]2K.
[118:57.33]Directional?
[118:58.11]Oh, I don't think a directional existed back in here.
[119:01.43]PlayStation 1.
[119:03.23]Come on, land.
[119:16.58]Two, go!
[119:24.72]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine,
[120:11.84]Mantis Park.
[120:18.48]Did you imagine being served by Jerma?
[120:20.58]Imagine you're just at the dinner.
[120:23.18]And I walk up.
[120:25.11]Hello.
[120:26.41]Oh, hello, you two.
[120:27.69]How are the three of you?
[120:28.89]How you doing?
[120:30.47]Welcome.
[120:30.97]Yep.
[120:31.57]Welcome to the Cheesecake Factory.
[120:33.37]That's me.
[120:34.35]Hi, I'm going to be Jeremy.
[120:35.61]I'll be dealing with you today.
[120:36.85]And...
[120:39.40]Let me just tell you, we have got quite a special today.
[120:43.71]We've got an Eggs Benedict on top of a Beef Brisket that is smothered with the best gravy we've got this side of the Mississippi.
[120:51.62]Welcome again.
[120:52.18]I can take care of you.
[120:52.92]But Waters, all three of you?
[120:57.34]And then I'm like, you call me back over at some point, you're like, I think that's him.
[121:01.52]Hey, dude, are you... Are you Cherma?
[121:05.75]Sorry about that.
[121:07.37]No, no, I'm not.
[121:08.57]No, I'm not.
[121:09.41]And then I get another job, so I don't see you again.
[121:11.63]Yes, okay, goodbye.
[121:13.39]Good to see you.
[121:15.19]Leave a big one.
[121:15.73]Is it a wink?
[121:29.86]No, there wasn't.
[121:30.42]What a fucking lie.
[121:31.42]I have it up right here.
[121:33.36]No, there was.
[121:33.86]Holy shit.
[121:35.06]Alright, when running, use up and down directional buttons to avoid obstacles.
[121:43.05]Oh, it's just more of this.
[121:45.43]But only it's the kid now.
[121:49.79]Alright, I gotta dodge.
[121:52.57]Is that a dive or a jump?
[121:53.56]I don't understand which one that is.
[121:54.92]I got hit by every single frog.
[122:05.23]I'm jumping over those.
[122:06.43]How does that make any sense?
[122:12.99]Alright, I'm jumping over them and I'm just smashing them.
[122:22.86]Then I get the bill, and I see that you guys got like the 2 for 2 deal, whatever, the 2 for 5 meals deal, whatever the fuck they have at that gross restaurant.
[122:36.21]And you sit down, and you say, okay, okay, yeah, here's your tip, and I get like a 4% tip or something, that must have been terrible.
[122:49.40]And do I stop you and say, did I do something wrong?
[122:51.87]I mean, this is like, your bill was like 80 bucks and you gave me like $2.
[122:55.19]Is everything okay?
[123:05.86]He made it.
[123:06.98]He made it to Grandma's.
[123:17.26]I love these freeze frames, they look like shit.
[123:19.10]Look at me!
[123:19.74]When's the last time you guys had the Cheesecake Factory?
[123:25.99]Never.
[123:26.47]Never?
[123:49.05]Four years ago.
[123:52.57]The story of Rurika!
[123:53.80]Is this the last family member?
[124:07.43]Okay.
[124:12.31]Oh, I want to go.
[124:13.17]What is it?
[124:16.04]Holy shit!
[124:16.96]He just, like, threw the chalk at me!
[124:26.25]Well, um... That's... fucked up.
[124:32.65]What?
[124:33.51]Sneak out of the classroom.
[124:35.39]Move the kids around to reach the goal.
[124:37.52]Choose a kid with directional buttons and press X to decide.
[124:41.86]Don't get hit by the flying chalk.
[124:44.81]Game over if Rurika gets hit.
[124:47.19]Wake up dozing kids with an X. What, is this a switch, kids?
[124:51.72]Oh, he just punched that kid in the face!
[124:58.54]He just knocked that kid out!
[125:04.39]Run!
[125:04.89]Run out of the class!
[125:06.67]Run!
[125:16.12]Wait, what am I supposed to be doing?
[125:19.37]Switching seats?
[125:36.09]2, 1, 2, 2, Z, Z, 1, 2.
[125:36.85]What do you mean, why they all fall?
[125:39.83]Well, I've def... Everybody's sleeping in this guy's class.
[125:42.99]This would be so infuriating if you were a teacher.
[125:46.10]If you were fucking a... If you were fucking a teacher, and you turned around and every single fucking student was asleep, it'd be like, I get... We're gonna check to see if there's, like, a gas leak.
[125:56.90]That's the only explanation.
[125:58.72]Is there a fucking carbon monoxide leak in the school?
[126:04.05]Holy shit, I gotta do this again.
[126:14.70]Holy fuck.
[126:24.21]I actually might do it.
[126:26.19]No, the person's knocked out.
[126:31.64]Oh, I have to do it again.
[126:35.86]What are you doing?
[126:42.00]That many people are asleep in your class, man.
[126:43.78]Dude, that insta-punch to the face.
[126:50.99]Okay, let's go.
[126:55.41]Oh, shit!
[126:56.29]Oh, my God!
[126:57.21]Oh!
[127:19.26]Don't go!
[127:19.88]Wait!
[127:20.46]Why isn't it doing it?
[127:27.34]Go!
[127:27.52]Go!
[127:27.78]Move, move, move!
[127:29.29]I didn't... What is he doing?
[127:30.77]Where's my indicator?
[127:36.47]Oh!
[127:36.79]Okay, we're fine.
[127:37.35]What the f- I- Come on!
[127:46.67]Hurry up!
[127:50.25]Dude, is he gonna turn around every single time I hit the button?
[127:53.28]Alright, you gotta wake up.
[127:59.78]You gotta get up, get up!
[128:02.98]Wait, one, two... Don't turn, okay.
[128:10.05]Wake up, wake up!
[128:13.43]Wake up!
[128:14.89]Wake up, wake up!
[128:17.41]Got it.
[128:18.51]Go, get out!
[128:22.62]Am I not out?
[128:27.59]I can't do anything.
[128:28.37]Did I get out?
[128:30.53]I have no indicator.
[128:32.16]I can't move.
[128:34.88]What the fuck just happened?
[128:49.94]It has to be bottom right?
[128:53.04]It does not... I thought it had to be just the right side here.
[128:57.30]I had to be in the bottom right seat?
[129:02.77]That goal could very much be any of those two seats.
[129:07.15]Oh my fucking god.
[129:34.12]Get up.
[129:34.56]Wake up.
[129:39.67]Turn.
[129:45.46]Wake up.
[129:46.14]X to wake up.
[129:47.06]X to wake up.
[129:47.60]It's not waking up.
[129:48.36]X to wake up.
[129:48.84]It's not waking him up.
[129:50.76]Are they all peeing?
[129:53.58]What was that?
[130:05.61]Where's my indicator?
[130:06.59]I have to wait till he gets all the way to the end.
[130:16.58]Dude, where's... where's the... where's the cursor?
[130:20.64]I... I... I don't care.
[130:41.47]I got up!
[130:43.40]Okay, good.
[130:55.60]Dude, that punch in the face was... Unbelievable.
[130:59.09]That was brutal.
[131:02.15]That was fucked up.
[131:03.47]Excuse me, you dropped something!
[131:06.27]Oh, huh?
[131:07.65]It's a lady.
[131:13.81]What a beautiful lady.
[131:14.96]Shibuya.

[133:53.34]Is this mundane life simulator?
[133:56.35]No, it's incredible crisis.
[134:14.82]This game is insane.
[134:20.88]Don't remove memory card and controller.
[134:22.58]Is this mundane?
[134:26.64]The girl got her brains bashed in by her teacher.
[134:35.29]Am I in the bathroom?
[134:36.33]What are you talking about?
[134:38.31]What do you mean, am I in the bathroom?
[134:46.40]I'm not in the bathroom.
[134:50.30]Come with that robot.
[134:55.21]What's with the robot?
[135:00.79]Oh, it's like Build-A-Bear Workshop.
[135:03.79]Oh, I look terrible.
[135:18.02]Oh, and now this is where she makes a bear huge.
[135:24.22]Why is a bear alive?
[135:38.87]Rika, come and sing with us.
[135:47.03]Why am I locked in the bathroom?
[135:49.15]Why does this person keep saying this?
[135:52.57]Are you on drugs?
[135:53.15]What are you doing?
[135:56.97]A huge UFO appeared over the Tokyo Bay this evening.
[135:59.93]Its intention is still unknown.
[136:02.89]Mama.
[136:03.43]That's your mama?
[136:04.19]Someone is on the missile battery, but... Oh, it's Dad!
[136:16.55]Ignorant encounter.
[136:24.19]Oh, community crack night.
[136:27.35]Rurika Dad, why is he there?
[136:30.01]Hello, oh, Rurika Dad?
[136:32.65]Don't let them attack.
[136:34.29]That's the mothership.
[136:35.45]Oh, it's all coming together.
[136:37.65]Don't worry about it.
[136:38.37]Just don't let them attack.
[136:39.25]Don't let them attack.
[136:47.46]But you want to make contact with her?
[136:50.04]I'll help you.
[136:50.54]Aren't we supposed to sing?
[136:53.22]Follow the lights.
[136:55.72]The colors of the UFO's lights correspond to the respective colors of it.
[136:59.92]It's gonna be Simon Says.
[137:00.78]Remember the person that said that, like, two hours ago?
[137:03.88]They said, that's not a UFO, that's a huge Simon Says.
[137:07.67]Give that person a gold star.
[137:08.83]Twitch, where's my gold star?
[137:11.25]Where's my gold star?
[137:13.58]This is the best feedback you're going to get from any channel on this entire website.
[137:17.04]I want my gold star for somebody in chat.
[137:19.92]That only lasts for like 20 minutes.
[137:22.82]It's like a little mini VIP.
[137:24.36]It's a gold star and it pops up next to their name.
[137:27.34]And it's there for like 10 minutes.
[137:29.34]I want that.
[137:34.32]Here we go.
[137:36.59]They were right.
[137:43.44]When do we start?
[137:48.84]We have already started.
[137:58.70]Green.
[138:01.94]Pink.
[138:04.58]Green, pink, green.

[138:10.34]Oh.
[138:12.34]It's triangle.
[138:13.74]It's the button.

[138:24.58]XXX.
[138:27.30]I can do this one all day.
[138:28.24]You know how many times I pressed that in the last two Lord of the Rings streams?
[138:36.07]Circle.
[138:37.03]Circle.
[138:40.15]Take this guy off, they can't get cut away!

[156:53.97]That's not fair.
[157:07.08]Funniest Home Videos?
[157:07.96]Yeah, this is when... This is when grandma chugs the milk and then somebody says something funny and it comes out her nose.
[157:20.14]And they submit it to AFV.
[157:32.42]And Bob Saget goes...
[157:36.72]I'm going to take a drink of this milk and... Oh, no!
[157:39.41]It's out of my nose!
[157:51.57]The original... The original guy that does... This voice.

[159:40.47]Okay.
[159:41.73]Can we move on to the next slide, please?
[159:44.55]Yeah, this was Incredible Crisis.
[159:46.47]It's an old PlayStation 1 game, and it's a little weird.
[159:51.61]It's fun, though.
[160:08.62]I had a lot of fun.
[160:09.16]I thought that was great.
[160:13.10]And ladies and gentlemen, that has been Bite-Sized Monday.
[160:18.25]We'll see you tomorrow.
[160:27.25]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[160:29.41]We are not done.
[160:32.63]There is something else I want to put in here just to play for a little bit.
[160:38.37]Yeah, that was a lie.
[160:38.93]The thing I'm gonna put in next is a game that I've had for a while, and now is a great opportunity because the PlayStation is set up.
[160:54.70]It is the original.
[160:57.18]The original.
[160:59.03]Should I show it, or should I say it?
[161:01.13]I wonder.
[161:02.07]Should I say it, or should I show it?
[161:09.19]The original.
[161:13.92]Busta Groove.
[161:18.30]Busta Groove, the original.
[161:19.72]Yeah.
[161:31.89]Very, very, very good.
[161:33.01]Oh, yeah.
[161:33.59]The game's fucking crazy.
[161:36.15]Nobody knows that game?
[161:37.63]Did you see how many people just plugged their faces off when I just showed that?
[161:41.03]Is there an actual secret level?
[161:51.31]Bust a Groove, not Bust a Move.
[161:52.97]Bust a Move is the matching game.
[161:56.29]Bust a Groove is the dancing game.
[161:58.16]Okay.
[161:58.54]This actually is the secret part.
[161:59.90]Is this all footed?
[162:08.90]A meteor hits their house.
[162:20.47]Welcome to Incredible Crisis.
[162:23.65]Actual ending to the Rat movie, yeah.
[162:25.51]Alright, let's put in Buster Groove for a little bit.
[162:29.11]We'll play until I guess I'm done playing it.
[162:35.41]Hold on, let me just see.
[162:36.07]What, minigames?
[162:36.77]Is there another thing here?
[162:41.63]What about Hidden Folks?
[162:43.93]We can do that.
[162:45.99]We'll figure it.
[162:46.51]Whoa.
[162:47.35]Hold on, there's a lot of DVDs.
[162:50.54]Titanic Away.
[162:51.32]The Tense Teacher.
[162:53.34]What was your favorite minigame?
[162:54.42]Mine was probably... Hmm.
[163:01.04]What was my favorite?
[163:02.22]Hmm.
[163:07.56]Let's go by Stretcher.
[163:10.31]The porn one.
[163:11.09]Oh, that one.
[163:11.93]Yeah, sure.
[163:12.81]I liked the paramedics one.
[163:13.75]It was fun.
[163:14.91]They really messed with you.
[163:16.91]No, I think we've seen it all.
[163:21.82]I don't think there's anything that we haven't seen.
[163:23.96]Alright, let's take it out.
[163:33.13]And continue with, uh, Buster Proof.
[163:36.65]I mean, this stream's gonna be short, but it's not gonna be that.
[163:38.63]The only reason why the stream's gonna be short is because it's obviously getting late already.
[163:41.83]And we started late, so.
[163:43.13]And here comes that, your favorite sound.
