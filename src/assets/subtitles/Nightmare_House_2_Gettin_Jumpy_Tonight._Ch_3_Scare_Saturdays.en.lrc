[00:09.24]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.86]Jerma here with Chapter 3 of Nightmare House 2.
[00:15.86]Before we get started, crack open a fresh Dr. Pepper.
[00:20.25]Cherry Dr. Pepper.
[00:21.39]I actually haven't had this, so let's see how good this is.
[00:28.03]Smooth Cherry Dr. Pepper.
[00:30.19]It's been too long, Doctor.
[00:32.29]Alright, so let's just go here.
[00:36.08]Here's my bed.
[00:37.84]Pretty disheveled.
[00:38.96]Looks like a rotten corpse was lying on that.
[00:41.76]Chair, get out of my face!
[00:44.98]Nothing in... Nah, let's just go.
[00:47.59]Time to go.
[00:51.89]Hello!
[00:52.29]I remember that guy!
[00:54.05]I remember that guy from the end of the last chapter.
[00:56.37]God!
[01:01.56]Don't want to have to deal with that guy.
[01:10.10]Okay.
[01:11.08]So, if I go into the maintenance room, I'm going to light on fire.
[01:15.29]Sweet!
[01:16.01]Anything in here?
[01:21.23]Where's this guy?
[01:22.11]My flashlight wasn't even turned on.
[01:23.23]Um, I don't think there's anything in here.
[01:27.80]I'm taking the gun out, though, because that thing...
[01:32.77]Oh, I hate this chapter already, and I haven't even started playing.
[01:35.70]Oh, can I open this door?
[01:42.22]No, but... Can I break this?
[01:46.62]So what is this for?
[01:47.44]How come I can... Oh, can I blow... I can blow a hole in the wall, can't I?
[01:53.92]Oh, what?
[01:54.56]No, I can't.
[01:55.94]Oh, yeah, I can.
[01:56.50]Cool.
[02:01.62]So what the hell was in here?
[02:02.92]Oh, storage.
[02:03.72]Okay.
[02:08.38]I didn't mean to shoot the gun.
[02:10.47]Ooh, a revolver!
[02:11.71]Nice.
[02:14.71]No, I didn't die.
[02:17.71]That's not that long.
[02:18.61]Yeah, the little girl.
[02:27.06]She's a freak.
[02:31.40]Yeah, easier said than done.
[02:35.72]By the way, where is this guy?
[02:37.16]How come he's not, like, chased by monsters?
[02:44.59]Okay.
[02:46.45]Will do.
[02:47.33]So that guy's just not being attacked or anything.
[02:50.25]He's just kind of... I thought the fire was a monster.
[02:56.95]What the hell's going on?
[02:58.36]Oh, it was the fire again!
[03:00.74]Man, I'm losing my mind here, guys.
[03:05.52]Oh, that's nothing.
[03:08.00]Yeah.
[03:09.75]Why?
[03:10.25]Why?
[03:10.81]Why?
[03:11.27]Why is it saying that?
[03:13.93]Why does it keep saying that?
[03:14.95]Don't look behind you.
[03:15.59]Don't look behind you.
[03:18.43]Dude, there's no vent here.
[03:21.90]Unless I can, like, blow this up.
[03:27.07]Oh, okay, here it is.
[03:28.95]I would call this the first washing machine, not the third washing machine.
[03:35.03]Another vent.
[03:36.61]Fantastic!
[03:37.59]Where's my gun?
[03:44.50]Is this thing even wearing a bikini?
[03:46.46]Oh no, that's just like charred flesh.
[03:49.84]I'm just gonna pre- Oh, I lost all my bullets in my revolver.
[03:52.38]Good job, Gerber.
[03:53.52]That wasn't totally stupid.

[09:52.15]Let's go.
[09:52.69]Oh, now I'm talking about brightness.
[10:00.45]That was the brightest damn thing I've ever seen.
[10:05.57]Can't do anything in here, it looks like.
[10:07.25]I can take my protein powder.
[10:11.40]Let's get out of here.
[10:14.34]Check this door for any creeps.
[10:17.12]This thing just closed on its own, which means I bet you there's somebody in here having fun, hanging out.
[10:20.80]Yep, this guy.
[10:21.46]How you doing, sir?
[10:26.19]Nothing.
[10:28.15]Which means... God!
[10:32.23]I got no light now.
[10:33.83]How am I supposed to see where I'm going?
[10:36.92]How am I supposed to do this?
[10:38.96]Oh, there we go.
[10:42.68]Everything's slow motion.
[10:46.89]Everything is slow-mo.
[10:49.27]I don't like when things are slow-mo.
[10:51.41]Get me out of here.
[10:52.99]Get... God, that hurts every time.
[10:57.75]Get me out of here.
[10:58.45]Alright, when she does that again, I'm not gonna scream.
[11:02.34]Promise you.
[11:03.22]I'm just gonna go like this.
[11:06.66]Can't get in there.
[11:11.11]What?
[11:12.69]What the hell is going on?
[11:16.57]What is going on?
[11:19.97]Whoa.
[11:22.57]Alright, listen, I don't... I don't like this.
[11:25.89]What is that?
[11:28.47]What the hell is going on?
[11:30.37]What the hell?
[11:30.92]Stop it!
[11:32.20]Those are perfectly good beds!
[11:36.16]Can I at least take my protein powder?
[11:42.85]I gotta go in here, I think.
[11:45.55]Right?
[11:47.32]Yeah.
[11:49.02]I can't even see where I'm going.
[11:50.18]I need this for the light.
[11:56.08]There has been... I've jumped more times in this video than I think in all the Nightmare House videos combined.
[12:01.25]And it's not even things that are scary.
[12:02.57]It's just like dumb things.
[12:04.31]Like falling off a ledge or being touched by fire.
[12:07.80]Nothing like really that terrifying has happened.
[12:09.88]I'm just freaking out.
[12:12.26]Um.
[12:13.70]Okay.
[12:16.30]I'm missing something.
[12:19.34]What is it I'm missing?
[12:20.55]I am not entirely sure.
[12:24.41]Man, this is so dark.
[12:25.37]I need to like cheat and turn up the brightness.
[12:30.15]Wasn't that just a door here?
[12:31.15]Okay, there was legitimately just a door.
[12:34.81]A thing right here.
[12:35.61]Where the hell did it go?
[12:39.01]What?
[12:40.57]What's going on?
[12:43.70]What the hell is happening?
[12:47.60]What?
[12:48.28]What is going on here?
[12:51.36]Why am I, like, trapped in this room?
[12:56.84]Um... Are these walls getting smaller or something?
[13:02.67]Or am I just stupid and, like, not knowing how to go out of here?
[13:05.31]Is there, like, a ladder?
[13:05.89]There has to be, like, a ladder.
[13:10.01]What is going on?
[13:12.44]Dude, these walls are like closing in on me.
[13:14.04]I knew it.
[13:16.74]So what am I supposed to do?
[13:17.54]I'm gonna get crushed.
[13:18.66]I'm gonna get squished.
[13:19.78]I'm gonna get squished.
[13:20.74]I'm gonna get squished.
[13:21.32]Where do I go?
[13:23.24]Oh my god.
[13:23.66]Oh my god.
[13:24.12]Oh my god.
[13:33.84]What the hell?
[13:40.32]Dr. Pepper, let's drink it, baby.
[13:45.72]Oh my god.
[13:49.79]Okay.
[13:51.93]Is that the end of that chapter?
[13:53.05]It is.
[13:55.19]Goodness gracious.
[13:56.89]Well, thank you guys all so much for watching.
[13:58.51]I really do appreciate it.
[14:00.21]And I'll catch you guys all soon.
[14:02.55]See you next week for Scare Saturdays.
[14:06.21]Woohoo!
[14:16.89]I did not think that was going to happen.
[14:18.13]I just thought there was going to be computers.
[14:19.99]Alright, guys.
[14:21.01]See y'all soon.
[14:21.53]Oh, and I almost forgot.
[14:23.86]Take care, everybody.
