[00:05.55]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:07.21]Jerma here with a live spy gameplay commentary currently on Barn Blitz.
[00:15.14]So welcome.
[00:15.76]Just gonna jump in and play some TF2.
[00:18.58]And I'll show you how to deal with a bunch of blue mercenaries.
[00:26.37]Oh.
[00:27.47]Alright, let's play.
[00:28.27]Let's play.
[00:28.65]Let's play.
[00:29.03]Let's play.
[00:29.43]Come on.
[00:30.03]Come on.
[00:30.47]Just don't even realize that there's a spy waiting for this heavy to turn the corner and get him!
[00:37.19]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:39.21]Change.
[00:39.59]Change.
[00:40.87]God, I feel like it's been like a million years since I played Spy.
[00:43.16]Especially like live and being recorded.
[00:46.30]So let's see how this goes.
[00:47.28]Had an opportunity.
[00:48.04]It's okay.
[00:48.56]I still got it.
[00:50.04]And I had another opportunity.
[00:52.28]It's okay.
[00:52.66]I got that one too.
[00:53.40]It's okay.
[00:53.88]Just chill out, everyone.
[00:54.70]Chill.
[00:55.26]Just chill out back here.
[00:57.46]So that sniper's going for you, he knows, change disguise, go to a scout, hide in the bush.
[01:04.32]I should probably move here.
[01:05.84]Dammit!
[01:07.66]This is bad, this is bad.
[01:09.40]This is real bad.
[01:10.96]Actually, not really.
[01:11.56]I'm in a not terrible position, because there's a... I say that as a spy.
[01:17.76]Okay.
[01:19.38]I haven't really had an opportunity to say any words.
[01:22.61]But, yes.
[01:24.41]The word I will say is yes at the moment, apparently.
[01:30.33]You!
[01:31.23]Again?
[01:33.11]Where are you?
[01:33.69]Please don't tell me I'm not gonna get that.
[01:35.73]Where?
[01:38.39]Is he here?
[01:39.49]I feel like he's dead ringering.
[01:40.75]Is that another one?
[01:43.18]All I'm doing is reacting!
[01:44.36]Might be able to get this pyro.
[01:49.18]In fact, we'll hopefully get a couple here.
[01:51.97]There's spy checking, which is a good opportunity for some kills.
[02:01.34]Ah!
[02:02.16]No!
[02:02.64]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:04.52]Get me out of there.
[02:06.42]The seal spy never dies.
[02:08.98]He always finds a way.
[02:12.36]Does something spawn here?
[02:14.14]I forget.
[02:14.54]Well, it doesn't really matter because I'm in full health anyways.
[02:20.73]But something to talk about.
[02:21.83]Something to talk about.
[02:22.55]I'll talk about something in this video.
[02:25.01]What the fuck is that?
[02:26.56]Is that... What?
[02:30.38]Is that... Could I just see that shadow of a spy?
[02:33.00]I did.
[02:34.68]Yeah, I could.
[02:37.50]He had the same hat on.
[02:39.35]That was really weird.
[02:41.59]Anyways, Halloween's coming up.
[02:43.61]And I have... A Halloween video...
[02:47.32]that hopefully is going to get done, and hopefully people think is interesting.
[02:53.54]And I'm not gonna give you... I'll give you one hint.
[02:56.94]It has to do with iconic video game characters.
[03:01.20]There's your hint.
[03:02.17]What the fuck am I doing?
[03:04.39]Why did I just do that?
[03:05.91]I just jumped right down on everybody's face.
[03:07.29]That was stupid.
[03:08.99]Get off of this!
[03:10.31]Why am I still Sniper?
[03:11.97]That's very obvious.
[03:14.07]Oh shit.
[03:16.77]Hopefully he doesn't.
[03:17.45]No, he didn't.
[03:18.19]Good.
[03:19.35]Very, very good.
[03:21.75]Still alive, too, which is somewhat remarkable.
[03:26.84]Don't... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you all know.
[03:30.16]Yeah.
[03:31.18]Or do you?
[03:32.08]Okay.
[03:33.04]Well, now you obviously know, because I picked up the health.
[03:35.28]Well, the ammo.
[03:37.79]I got, like, all the stuff.
[03:40.85]Hi.
[03:41.59]Hello.
[03:43.99]He's gonna get killed by this edge.
[03:47.94]No!
[03:49.32]What is... I'm bumping into sentries?
[03:51.40]What am I bumping into?
[03:52.12]What's even happening?
[03:56.58]Hmm.
[03:58.00]I need a plan of action here.
[04:00.16]That plan of action is going to be just run straight at them.
[04:03.76]That's a pretty good idea, right?
[04:06.14]Yeah, apparently it was a really good idea.
[04:07.89]Because I made it out of that.
[04:09.44]No, I didn't.
[04:10.66]No, I didn't.
[04:12.34]Actually, thanks for the help.
[04:13.32]You just, like, helped me get back up here.
[04:14.56]I need to, like, do... I haven't got a kill in, like, two straight minutes.
[04:17.32]I'm dead.
[04:18.24]I'm dead.
[04:18.86]I'm dead.
[04:20.56]Son of a bitch!
[04:22.12]Son of a bitch, come here!
[04:28.85]I did it!
[04:30.69]Do not kill me!
[04:32.89]I am not your enemy!
[04:35.29]I am not your enemy!
[04:37.67]Oh, let's change to Pyro?
[04:39.93]And... Please don't hear that.
[04:44.29]Thank you for not hearing that.
[04:47.02]What do we got?
[04:48.74]That's a crit, that's a crit.
[04:49.32]Don't want to die from a crit.
[04:52.32]Still alive!
[04:53.16]Dude, this is... Remember when I mentioned in the beginning that I haven't played Spy in a while?
[04:58.26]Like, live?
[04:59.68]Don't ask me why I'm doing fairly decently.
[05:02.74]I haven't died.
[05:04.63]This just must be... some type of... fluke!
[05:08.95]Nooo, where is he?
[05:11.31]No, don't shoot me.
[05:13.29]I will get you with this headshot when you turn... when you come around this corner.
[05:15.97]There, did you see that?
[05:16.43]Did you see that?
[05:18.71]I got him.
[05:19.05]I got him.
[05:19.33]On my head.
[05:20.45]Damn it!
[05:20.93]Somebody will finish him off.
[05:22.09]No, they won't.
[05:22.55]I will.
[05:24.02]I will.
[05:25.08]I don't even care.
[05:28.00]I do care.
[05:28.68]What am I talking about?
[05:30.80]This is where we die.
[05:31.88]Because I'm standing totally still like a fucking idiot.
[05:36.11]With the man-melter.
[05:36.83]The guy man-melted me.
[05:38.29]And I died.
[05:42.43]Don't let him get it.
[05:43.17]Don't let him get it.
[05:45.15]Do not let them get this under any circumstances.
[05:48.83]Get out of my way.
[05:49.35]Get out of my way.
[05:50.03]I don't want you to see me.
[05:50.63]Can I still get it?
[05:54.99]Okay.
[05:56.11]Hold back.
[05:56.51]Hold back here.
[05:57.01]Hold back.
[05:57.37]Hold back.
[05:57.83]I'm just a pyro.
[06:00.89]Just a pyro.
[06:05.87]Alright, we're okay.
[06:08.05]That guy's gonna get backstabbed.
[06:09.13]No, he's gonna freak out, and he's gonna turn to kill that spy, thinking that I'm not a spy, I will end up getting the kill.
[06:17.67]Oh, that's really, really annoying.
[06:20.47]He thought he got the kill on the spy, but the spy, there's two of us, and, you know, he just... don't get spotted.
[06:29.90]That's bad, because now, I just did, like, the I'm definitely a guaranteed spy move.
[06:34.30]Where I looked at him and I went, no, I spun around real fast.
[06:38.26]But it's not going to get me killed, I don't think.
[06:39.78]Not yet, at least.
[06:42.85]Let's change.
[06:43.31]Speaking of spy, let's disguise as a spy.
[06:47.47]I'm okay with this.
[06:50.69]And drop down.
[06:53.02]Get you.
[06:54.56]And this guy, too.
[06:58.51]Can we do this for another seven minutes?
[07:01.81]I don't know.
[07:03.39]But I'm going to go this way.
[07:04.21]I'm going to wrap around.
[07:06.45]To potentially... Don't.
[07:09.49]Don't.
[07:11.53]Don't.
[07:14.23]Holy shit.
[07:15.11]Why did that not work?
[07:17.34]I was like cut off by the door.
[07:19.72]You are a spy.
[07:21.14]Who will win?
[07:22.26]You cannot defeat me.
[07:24.63]He's running.
[07:25.09]Where you running?
[07:26.75]Where you running, man?
[07:28.99]That was a spy vs. spy fight.
[07:33.37]I don't know why I like to do that.
[07:34.89]I like to activate the dead ringer jumping down.
[07:36.87]But it's the most obvious thing you could ever do.
[07:40.76]Just feels fun.
[07:43.62]I'll get around him.
[07:46.94]Oh, what am I... I'm breaking the rule here.
[07:48.56]What?
[07:48.80]Just... what?
[07:49.36]What?
[07:55.80]What?
[07:56.58]What?
[07:57.26]What?
[07:58.34]What?
[07:58.70]I... That hit him.
[08:01.64]I refuse to believe that.
[08:04.38]I should have just walked up and stabbed him, but I wanted to get the double ambassador headshot.
[08:07.85]That was a stupid move.
[08:11.43]I was trying to get on, like, the highlight reel, and I should have just, like, killed the damn guy.
[08:16.91]Could have walked up and just stabbed him right in his, like, fucking butt cheeks.
[08:21.48]But no, I gotta get that... No.
[08:25.78]Just get the sure thing.
[08:28.67]Jeremiah.
[08:32.33]Here I go again.
[08:34.05]Come on!
[08:34.83]Come on, Gibbs.
[08:40.38]What do you say?
[08:41.94]Drop down on somebody.
[08:49.23]We held them for a long time, but it's coming down to, like, the last second here.
[08:52.11]It's gonna be the last minute.
[08:52.95]They're gonna get it to, like, right there.
[08:55.71]And it's gonna be either team's game.
[08:58.37]I really don't know who at this point.
[08:59.97]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[09:03.29]Well, he pushed it pretty far for being one person on it.
[09:08.33]For the remaining 60 seconds, I really just kind of want to protect this area.
[09:11.70]I don't want anyone to jump down from here or something.
[09:16.18]I think we're gonna be golden, though.
[09:18.34]We really do.
[09:20.68]Hmm.
[09:22.74]There is a scout.
[09:24.23]Look, I'm pretending to push it with you.
[09:28.09]I, for some reason, thought that was over.
[09:29.51]I don't know why.
[09:32.11]Holy shit, you are a heavy.
[09:37.07]Stay focused on him.
[09:38.29]30 seconds now.
[09:40.77]Damn it.
[09:42.52]It's alright, though.
[09:42.96]I think we got it.
[09:45.46]As long as this guy sticks around.
[09:47.65]As long as these two guys stick around here... I don't think they're gonna get it.
[09:51.95]And we win the game.
[09:53.91]Nice.
[09:56.51]Nice use of the charge shot.
[09:59.85]Ten seconds!
[10:00.46]I thought that was by.
[10:03.28]Final push!
[10:04.24]Let's see if they can do anything with it.
[10:06.34]Otherwise, we win the game.
[10:09.42]Hey!
[10:11.02]Overtime!
[10:13.14]Three, two, one...
[10:17.94]62 points?
[10:20.68]When the fuck did that happen?
