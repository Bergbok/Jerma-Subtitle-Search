[01:59.69]That's weird.
[02:02.43]Anyways, let's say hello to some people before we play Outlast.
[02:07.89]That rat simulator was just a riddle little simulator game for fun.
[02:11.81]Now let's get on to the real deal here.
[02:13.19]Hey, mostly lost.
[02:14.15]Thank you for the five bucks.

[02:31.70]Oh, for buying that game.
[02:32.78]Alright, I get you.
[02:33.98]Thank you.
[02:35.28]Unnecessary, but thank you.
[02:37.26]Okay.
[02:38.74]Let's continue.
[02:40.48]I don't remember where I was.
[02:46.28]Serious streamer.
[02:49.28]Okay, what was the last thing we did?
[02:53.22]I really don't know.
[02:54.60]I guess I'm going this way, though.
[03:02.26]Wait, was... I feel like I was here before.
[03:05.68]Okay, yeah.
[03:06.55]I got through here, right?
[03:12.53]I think I have to go this way.
[03:15.07]There's like a dead cow there.
[03:22.39]Oh, oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[03:25.86]Earbud.
[03:26.28]I know, I got it, I got it, don't worry, I got it.
[03:27.74]I could fit through that if I could get the gate open.
[03:42.02]Open it, dude.
[03:44.44]Find a hook to lift the gate.
[03:49.85]Dude, Outlast... Seriously, Outlast on... What was that?
[03:55.17]Did you see that?
[03:55.81]It was like something just went by my face.
[03:59.95]Outlast is seriously the king of having you find something that you have to, like an object you have to get.
[04:06.27]To bring it back to this place.
[04:08.13]So you gotta go back all the way to where it was, and then watch out because here comes some scary people.
[04:12.82]That's like, that's the MO of this game.
[04:15.64]Hey, you need an object, but watch out, scary people are in your way now.
[04:18.70]Alright, I need a hook.
[04:24.74]I gotta pay attention for batteries too.
[04:28.00]You know, I ain't gonna be fucking stupid about this.
[04:32.00]I need a hook.
[04:34.27]A hook.
[04:40.01]This don't open... This... I can, like, crawl in here.
[04:51.64]Chapter 1.
[04:52.40]The Words of Sullivan.
[04:58.74]Why can't the object you go look for be a gun?
[05:03.60]Like, honestly... Honest to God... Just bandage.
[05:08.65]I don't need any bandages.
[05:11.09]So far, also... Bandages seem to be way more in supply than batteries.
[05:15.45]I don't know.
[05:20.31]Alright, looking for... Looking for, like, a hook.
[05:23.52]Or a crank.
[05:24.88]Or a...
[05:26.66]A thing, a thing, a bob.
[05:28.60]I don't see anything in here, so I guess this is just a battery.
[05:32.76]An advantage, but I don't need it.
[05:33.66]Let's go.
[05:38.86]Oh, by the way, we are no longer doing the straight face challenge like we were last night.
[05:42.82]I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[05:46.17]No longer doing the straight face challenge.
[05:47.77]So I can get scared if I want to, okay?
[05:51.69]Nobody get mad at me for getting scared.
[05:55.79]God damn it.
[05:59.95]I guarantee you I gotta go that way.
[06:02.25]Oh my lord, don't even, seriously, don't even.
[06:06.99]Is there any, like, oh, okay.
[06:13.42]She saw me do this, absolutely.
[06:17.20]She's gonna reach in here and just grab me.
[06:21.10]I'm gonna drown in here before she gets here.
[06:26.97]I'm gonna die in here before she gets it.
[06:28.73]It's like, I'm doing a great job hiding.
[06:35.43]Don't... Shit, where the fuck is she?
[06:51.55]She's right there.
[07:04.19]You shitty little shitty!
[07:07.08]Not!
[07:07.66]Not!
[07:09.30]Not!
[07:09.86]Not!
[07:10.74]Not!
[07:11.86]Not!
[07:17.34]Don't see me here.
[07:23.15]Go in that building.
[07:24.13]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[07:25.37]Oh, you fucker.
[07:31.15]No, she didn't see me.
[07:43.50]God damn it.
[07:53.23]Keep going that way.
[07:57.85]What kind of fucking pathing is this, by the way?
[08:01.58]Like, seriously.
[08:02.80]She just walks by, you have to fucking run by her.
[08:13.75]Honest to God, like, her pathing is just, like... She just... There's no way I can get through this.
[08:25.76]I'm just gonna smash through this.
[08:34.30]She usually, like, mumbles a bunch of dog shit.
[08:37.34]I'm just gonna have to run.
[08:38.66]Like, really.
[08:52.91]Okay, looking for a hook.
[08:55.33]Hook.
[08:59.43]Hook?
[09:02.01]No, she, like, came from here, too, and, like, there's nothing over here?
[09:04.30]Really?
[09:05.42]Come on, there's gotta be something over here that I need.
[09:10.30]Really?
[09:11.84]Nothing?
[09:14.56]No way.
[09:23.87]I didn't have to go this way.
[09:28.83]I guess I go right here.
[09:37.28]Yeah, you'd think there would be a way through.
[09:42.85]I need that fucking hook.
[09:46.89]And then I gotta remember how the hell to get back here.
[09:50.13]Shit, what the hell is that?
[10:02.85]Oh, Lord.
[10:09.68]I'm, like, kind of already lost, too, by the way.
[10:11.80]In case everybody was wondering.
[10:15.02]I, like, I don't even know how to backtrack right now.
[10:31.60]Apparently I gotta videotape this.
[10:37.45]Let's watch it and see what my commentary is.
[10:40.83]Let's watch my fucking murder gameplay commentary.
[10:45.15]Pretty good, like, gameplay commentary this guy's doing.
[10:56.06]Well, this looks like it's the hook room.
[10:59.02]Right?
[11:01.62]There's a little spot to go right there.
[11:03.16]You can hide in the blood vat.
[11:15.43]Guy's gonna break through.
[11:16.19]No.
[11:17.71]Okay.
[11:26.98]It got like, real quiet.
[11:37.78]So, just out of curiosity, how far away am I from the end of the... Yeah, I found the hook.
[11:46.07]Where am I right now?
[11:47.23]Like, in regards to how many hours are left in the game, for those of you that have completed it so far.
[11:54.39]It doesn't open, so I've got to get it.
[11:56.24]And... Here we go, in 3, 2, 1, here comes a jump scare.
[12:09.09]Here comes the fucking jumpscare, dude.
[12:11.69]Yeah, there she is, too.
[12:12.59]I can hear her.
[12:13.67]Yeah, here she comes.
[12:14.27]Alright, we're going for it.
[12:16.19]It's ready.
[12:16.49]Just sprint by.
[12:17.63]Just go.
[12:18.25]Sprint by her.
[12:18.99]Sprint by her.
[12:20.51]That wasn't even the right way.
[12:21.73]I went to sprint by her and I didn't sprint by anything.
[12:30.00]I gotta sneak through the little hole here.
[12:33.28]She's gonna bust through the doors and I gotta sneak by.
[12:35.34]Right here, sneaking.
[12:37.02]Nice sneak.
[12:39.13]Nice work.
[12:40.31]Run.
[12:45.18]She's right there.
[12:48.38]Where though?
[12:49.14]Where?
[12:59.34]Don't, don't.
[12:59.80]What are you doing?
[13:00.45]Get up.
[13:08.08]Okay.
[13:09.08]And then I bang a left.
[13:14.02]Replace that battery right now.
[13:16.42]I don't have any batteries, apparently.
[13:18.20]Just gotta go this way.
[13:26.60]Right down here.
[13:29.50]Where's the trash can to hide in?
[13:38.60]WHAT THE F- WHAT?!
[13:47.19]That doesn't even make any sense!
[13:49.97]That doesn't even make any fucking sense!
[13:51.77]Like, come on!
[14:03.79]What?
[14:04.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[14:05.69]What, what, what?
[14:06.61]Do I have the item?
[14:09.41]I don't understand.
[14:10.09]I have the item, right?
[14:13.78]If I don't have the item, I'm gonna be like, I don't even, where did it even put me?
[14:18.42]Where the fuck did it even put me?
[14:19.40]What the hell's going on?
[14:24.94]Where, where the hell did that just put me?
[14:32.36]It saved before... I remember when I grabbed the item, it saved.
[14:40.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:43.24]Okay, so... I'm gonna go this way.
[14:59.01]That's where I was.
[14:59.65]Yeah, for a second I thought it would put me all the way back.
[15:04.74]Alright, give me a chance to run by her now.
[15:07.26]Come on.
[15:09.00]Come on.
[15:14.72]She's obviously still here.
[15:17.36]I'm not gonna drown, so I need to come up.
[15:25.24]Really?
[15:25.92]Fucking really?
[15:27.10]He's still just here?
[15:27.82]I'm gonna, like, run right into her again.
[15:43.59]She's right there.
[15:44.25]I really hope she just walks by.
[15:51.49]She's... She's fucking right... She's fucking right here, dude.
[16:03.68]Guys, that's not blood.
[16:05.90]That's a very slight fruit punch.
[16:11.03]Why is Marge Simpson after you?
[16:12.97]That's a good question.
[16:15.57]I'm kind of at the fucking point now, and it's like time to go.
[16:18.28]Like, fucking, I don't even care.
[16:19.68]Go.
[16:21.58]Like, I have to go this way, right?
[16:23.02]Over here.
[16:32.15]Alright, does anybody remember Outlast 1?
[16:33.83]You know, I don't even care.
[16:34.57]I'm just running by her.
[16:36.04]Like, can I just do that?
[16:37.50]I can do that.
[16:38.10]I definitely can do that.
[16:39.28]Alright, let me just tell you something about Outlast 1.
[16:41.44]In Outlast 1, the, like, named kind of scary monster people that, like, chased you around, they... They didn't instantly fucking kill you if they came within five feet of you.
[16:58.13]The reason why Outlast 1 was actually scary is because this wasn't an instant guaranteed fucking kill.
[17:04.64]They would grab you and like fucking smash you and throw you and you had to keep running.
[17:08.26]Like, what is with these named characters instantly fucking kill you now?
[17:14.50]This shit is fucking, that is fucking stupid.
[17:17.32]Remember like the scary fucking Doctor in Outlast 1, how terrifying he was?
[17:26.39]He was terrifying and he like chased you around and he would like grab you and smash you and like you were actually afraid.
[17:32.82]This, like, lady with the fucking scythe is just an instant, just if you walk anywhere close to her, she's gonna kill you.
[17:39.39]And go hide in a barrel.
[17:46.35]No, this is on normal.
[17:47.15]This is on, like, the normal difficulty.
[17:58.29]And you got, like, chased.
[17:59.47]I remember getting, like, chased and it was scary.
[18:01.74]This is just like, you die if she comes near you!
[18:13.38]Just play Outlast 1.
[18:14.40]Um...
[18:20.20]Can she walk over this way?
[18:22.68]Is she walking around right now?
[18:25.28]I can't even tell.
[18:25.86]I wasn't even paying attention.
[18:28.18]She's going to be right in front of my face in a second here.
[18:47.69]I'm going to walk right into her, aren't I?
[18:53.93]I can't even, like, see where the fuck I'm going.
[18:59.61]She's, like, right here.
[19:00.49]I actually could... Could they have recorded some more lines?
[19:20.24]I mean, she's, like, a scary character, I guess, but, like...
[19:24.32]I don't know.
[19:27.98]Can I just keep going around?
[19:32.38]I guess maybe.
[19:36.70]No.
[19:42.37]Marge Simpson.
[19:43.93]I can't get over Marge Simpson.
[19:50.31]Where the fuck is she?
[19:52.97]She's right there.
[19:56.21]Like she needs to her her path needs to be she got to keep moving lady Like she doesn't walk around she's like just sitting right here like walk around look for me Like is there a different place where she can she like please go somewhere else I
[20:24.67]I'm just going to go over here and wait for a second.
[20:42.11]She's just standing in the same spot.
[20:45.27]Should I just take her back this way or something?
[20:47.21]No.
[20:47.31]I might have to go all the way around.
[21:06.35]You see what I'm talking about, though?
[21:08.17]Will she move from this little spot?
[21:12.61]There she is.
[21:17.90]All right.
[21:19.80]Go over there.
[21:21.38]Keep going.
[21:27.31]She's going to see me.
[21:27.99]I might as well, like... She'll think I'm okay now.
[21:38.05]I don't even know if I went the right fucking way.
[21:40.69]I went the wrong way.
[21:42.59]Yeah, I went the wrong way.
[21:44.23]I had my chance there, and I just got so fucking turned around.
[21:53.28]That was it, too.
[21:54.70]Every single thing is the exact same thing in this game.
[22:01.48]Everything is the same.
[22:02.69]Everything.
[22:03.33]Everything.
[22:06.39]It seems to be way worse than the first one.
[22:08.05]It is a thousand times worse than Outlast 1.
[22:12.99]And I mean a thousand fucking times worse than Outlast 1.
[22:22.95]Now I'm like in the fucking weeds again.
[22:24.37]There she is.
[22:26.98]And what shall I say to him?
[22:35.36]Like, I don't even fucking remember where I'm going right now.
[22:38.74]Because, like, everything is the exact same.
[22:41.88]There's no difference to anything.
[22:43.86]There's, like, some, there's some, like, random lights.
[22:47.79]I'm gonna get caught again.
[22:49.63]That's right here.
[22:50.27]I don't even know if this is the right way.
[22:53.89]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[22:54.91]Sprint, sprint, sprint!
[22:55.81]Get out!
[22:56.59]Go!
[23:08.63]What is happening?
[23:09.97]What?
[23:13.98]This is fucking so stupid.
[23:27.65]Like, why did they make it like this?
[23:30.87]I don't understand.
[23:31.75]Like, pull the chain!
[23:40.66]Oh my god.
[23:41.30]Okay.
[23:41.54]Fuck.
[23:41.88]Let's keep moving.
[24:03.49]That is the mine.
[24:04.83]Where the heretics are opposed.
[24:07.95]That's where they've got Lin.
[24:09.99]Come on, get up there!
[24:11.81]You could play Outlast 1.
[24:12.81]Yeah, but this is new, though.
[24:15.20]This is like a new thing.
[24:16.46]I'm just like so... Like, I'm...
[24:41.07]by a mosquito.
[24:43.89]Watch out for the mosquitoes, guys.
[24:48.62]Ooh!
[24:56.20]Can I not open this door?
[24:58.05]Why?
[25:04.93]Wait.
[25:05.75]Wait.
[25:07.41]This is before I found her hanging.
[25:16.17]Back at the school.
[25:19.69]Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica, Jessica!
[25:25.83]A mosquito doctor could fix that right up.
[25:31.07]I forgot about mosquito doctor.
[25:32.91]Just like her father.
[25:35.25]Hello, we're the monsters!
[25:44.09]Does the clock move?
[25:45.23]What do you guys think?
[25:46.97]Will this actually move to, like, 1225?
[25:52.07]I'm just wasting battery.
[25:59.11]Come on.
[25:59.81]I need to know if there's actually clocks programmed into this game.
[26:02.87]Nope.
[26:03.91]Nope.
[26:11.78]Thank you, Blake.
[26:25.45]I hear the clock.
[26:26.29]The clock in real time just went... Oh, this is where they did all the experiments to me and my family.
[26:34.13]I know it.
[26:34.52]This is where they did all the fucking experiments.
[26:36.64]See?
[26:36.80]What?
[26:47.18]RIP immersion.
[26:52.38]Give me the battery.
[26:54.22]Oh, I heard... That means there's a... There's a fucking monster on the loose.
[27:01.73]Maybe.
[27:03.75]Okay, what about this door?
[27:07.27]This one opens.
[27:07.95]What about this one?
[27:08.57]Nope.
[27:11.45]What about this one?
[27:12.19]Nah.
[27:15.54]Don't play the tape.
[27:16.34]It's a trap.
[27:16.76]The guy's gonna sprint right in my face.
[27:18.16]I know how this... You see?
[27:20.64]I know how this game works.
[27:21.80]I know how these games work.
[27:22.88]You can't do that to me and expect me not to know what's gonna happen.
[27:26.78]I didn't even flinch.
[27:32.72]Get the hard drive.
[27:33.42]See what's on his fucking hard drive.
[27:35.70]Oh.
[27:36.22]No, that's a changer beeper.
[27:38.57]That's not a hard drive.
[27:40.27]Anything else?
[27:41.67]Ooh, there's another door.
[27:43.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:47.46]What's down that hallway?
[27:48.66]Oh boy.
[27:52.14]Fuck out.
[27:53.50]This is where Principal McAdams tried to kill me that one time.
[27:59.14]What?
[28:01.06]What are you talking about?
[28:05.95]A hangman?
[28:07.71]Can I solve the puzzle?
[28:08.85]Can I solve this right now?
[28:14.67]I want to solve the puzzle, Gene.
[28:26.53]nothing under there really come on come on there has to be something under here right okay I need the transparency oh god damn it okay well I I have to put like like a stupid little picture on there now I just I just saw a guy I just saw a guy
[28:58.47]There's a guy that just walked by there.
[29:04.35]So I need, like, the thing to go over the protractor.
[29:09.00]And then once that's on the protractor, I'll solve the mystery.
[29:13.24]I'm just going to wait for the principal to sprint in my face.
[29:17.22]Jammed.
[29:27.02]Was it in here?
[29:27.86]I don't even know.
[29:28.50]It's on, like, somebody's desk, probably.
[29:32.51]Can't open these.
[29:34.27]This way.
[29:34.81]No.
[29:41.54]Spooky classroom, yep.
[29:44.26]No, I was here already.
[29:45.52]Are you the hall monitor?
[29:57.34]That's jammed.
[30:00.01]Come on, Fred.
[30:00.75]Solve this.
[30:01.39]I mean, I'm trying.
[30:02.89]What's wrong with my guy?
[30:17.64]If I was a fucking stupid transparency thing, where would I be?
[30:29.64]Is this it?
[30:30.70]Yeah, okay, this is it.
[30:33.05]There it is.
[30:35.63]I got it.
[30:37.51]Now here comes the principal.
[30:42.75]How dare you take my drawing?
[30:47.05]You little shit.
[30:51.80]Did you see my spooky lockers?
[30:53.64]That was supposed to deter you from doing any puzzle solving.
[30:58.13]Didn't seem to work.
[30:59.05]You're too bright.
[31:00.63]You're too intelligent of a student.
[31:02.36]I knew you'd solve it.
[31:14.83]So like
[31:27.11]Un-refrigerate.
[31:29.07]Oh my god.
[31:32.25]Sounds about right.
[31:33.27]Un-refrigerate.
[31:36.01]Un-refrigerate it.
[31:38.94]I gotta move it.
[31:44.46]Wait.
[31:47.62]Is that it?
[31:56.87]That's it.
[32:00.76]Can I do anything with this now?
[32:02.06]How come there was no sequence?
[32:08.92]I'm going to walk out here and something's going to happen, right?
[32:15.29]Okay.
[32:20.28]Okay.
[32:28.17]Okay.
[32:29.76]Another hallway.
[32:31.04]This time with an exit sign in the end.
[32:32.82]But I'm going to get so close to the exit sign and then Principal McAdams is going to come out and be like, You're not getting out of my school!
[32:42.34]See, watch.
[32:44.02]Here he comes.
[32:45.30]Here he comes.
[32:49.70]Yeah.
[32:50.60]I told you.
[32:54.85]Here he comes!
[32:56.61]Here he comes!
[32:58.59]He's like a school bus coming down the hallway!
[33:00.67]What?
[33:14.75]Oh no, you're locked in!
[33:32.55]Oh, the principal's really fucked up.
[33:37.63]I, like... I, like...
[34:00.94]Let me reload my battery.
[34:02.10]That was like... Oh, here he comes again.
[34:04.75]Watch, ready?
[34:06.27]It's gonna happen again.
[34:10.23]Now he's like hiding in his office.
[34:11.43]See, this is... I told you it was the principal.
[34:12.67]This is his like fucked up office.
[34:21.04]This is where he got... See, the principal got like fired and he had to clear out his desk.
[34:26.54]Turned out...
[34:28.00]He was buried in the floorboards.
[34:37.53]I want to get up there.
[34:40.09]Get me up there.
[34:40.89]And gosh darn it, man, you've got a mold issue.
[34:43.33]You've got a water issue.
[34:44.49]I just want to make sure that they're aware of this.
[34:47.27]You've got a water issue.
[34:48.29]I'm going to have to get somebody in here to take those panels off and see what's causing that drip.
[35:00.00]Like, can I... There he is.
[35:13.99]Can I not move anything in here?
[35:19.63]What?
[35:21.85]Can anything be fucking moved?
[35:23.07]Oh, God.
[35:30.03]okay let's go damn it no I didn't want you to like do the electric slide I wanted you to jump on it man here we go he's the principal's gonna be in here watch this I've obviously like I'm gonna turn the see there he is no that's not him I thought that was his teeth what the he's gonna grab me I'm just ready for it now just

[36:01.56]Alright, hurry, go!
[36:11.05]Run away!
[36:12.71]Oh, it's so scary!
[36:17.45]I just want to go home!
[36:27.92]There's the mine.
[36:29.50]And it's always a mine!
[36:33.92]It's always a mine!
[36:37.27]Like, can a horror game not have a fucking mine?
[36:41.01]You always go to the mines.
[36:44.11]I don't know, guys.
[36:45.53]We gotta make our way over to the mines.
[36:49.06]The mines in horror games is the exact same as the swamp in fucking FromSoftware Dark Souls games.
[36:56.12]I told you they made this game.
[36:58.76]Everyone's like, why do you keep saying From Software?
[37:00.58]Why do you keep saying that?
[37:02.74]This is the trope here.
[37:05.00]You go to the fucking mines.
[37:06.38]They made this game through a proxy outsourced to another company.
[37:14.23]They just don't want you to know.
[37:15.03]Wait, what does that say?
[37:16.01]I don't know.
[37:16.61]Who cares?
[37:16.99]Read it again.
[37:30.64]Everybody has these, like, question marks.
[37:33.76]By the way, what's with my, like, hair?
[37:35.22]My hair, like, looks like shit lately, huh?
[37:39.38]I've been, like, rolling out of bed and, like, not putting any, like, like, comb or any product in it or anything.
[37:43.88]I look like fucking shit.
[37:45.96]Okay, it's not that far.
[37:47.58]I hope it's right there.
[38:02.02]I'm sorry.
[38:12.55]He like made it across.
[38:14.07]This guy makes it across and then like fucking turns around and goes up.
[38:17.53]Okay, it's not so bad.
[38:22.07]This is so dangerous.
[38:23.71]Why would you ever jump?
[38:28.55]Funny streamer.
[38:29.49]I know, right?
[38:30.13]What?
[38:34.77]Did you guys like how funny of a streamer I'm being?
[38:39.20]I'm being a really funny streamer.
[38:40.52]Okay, no, I'm done.
[38:41.92]Let's go.
[38:44.58]I didn't expect that other hole to be there.
[38:49.45]Okay, here we go.
[38:52.07]Just like in The Last Guardian.
[38:55.49]I've made a lot of Last Guardian references.
[38:57.13]I don't know why.
[38:58.62]What in the...
[39:03.65]Oh god, there's like bugs now.
[39:12.55]Come on, I gotta- the footage is more important!
[39:23.66]Was that supposed to happen?
[39:26.24]And I didn't get it!
[39:27.86]I didn't get it.
[39:39.80]I'm glad they brought in Droopy the dog for his cameo in Outlast 2.
[39:42.97]What the fuck was that?
[39:57.71]Oh, I'm upside down.
[39:58.49]Yeah.
[40:11.20]I've got to do some swinging here, right?
[40:24.09]A little bit brighter?
[40:30.55]You guys think you need some brightness?
[40:32.31]Somebody said to put the brightness up a little.
[40:38.09]Is that good?
[40:49.35]Alright, like... They're not gonna do this again, are they?
[40:55.25]Don't... I really hope they don't do this again.
[40:57.07]Okay, thank God.
[40:59.45]If they did the camera broken thing... Disable V-Sync.
[41:04.17]No, there's a ton of screen tearing if I do.
[41:08.71]Yeah, we got fucking Gamma, baby.
[41:10.20]Um... Oh, this turned up.
[41:14.98]Why not?
[41:16.62]Yeah, without VSync on, there's a ton of motion blur.
[41:24.28]Not motion blur.
[41:24.94]There's a ton of screen tearing.
[41:32.14]Low resolution to the lowest you can raise.
[41:34.24]Why would I do that?
[41:37.78]This guy with the fucking blowgun is going to be chasing me now, right?
[41:46.49]Enable triple buffering.
[41:51.25]I'm still getting prompts for this.
[41:56.29]No, no triple buffering, man.
[42:06.94]Somebody's... Alright, either somebody's taking a really satisfying woods dump, or someone's in trouble.
[42:13.09]The fuckworm mistook his blessing for sickness and tried to leave and I broke him.
[42:19.01]Do not make his mistakes or commit his sins.
[42:21.73]God and his prophet love you.
[42:22.99]Okay.
[42:32.92]Another tightrope walk.
[42:35.56]Actually, I'm okay.
[42:36.20]I can do this without the camera.
[42:40.99]If you put your resolution on 144, the enemies can't see you?
[42:45.21]What?
[42:46.59]That seems oddly specific.
[42:56.19]Can I jump this?
[43:04.13]I can fucking hold on a second!
[43:05.97]Like, really!
[43:07.52]Let's go over this.
[43:08.88]For one second.
[43:11.20]I'm climbing over that like I like look at there's like a rock right here I can step oh why would you get on your fucking stomach and crawl in sludge to get over this no that's not the logical way to go over that you like to put your foot right here one step on the rock and walk over I'm just making this so much more difficult for myself I'm getting like down and like dirty for no fucking reason
[43:41.00]I have to go in, like, the tree trunk.
[43:45.51]There he comes.
[43:46.85]The scary, like, spinner.
[43:49.23]The licker is gonna come get me.
[43:52.33]He's on top.
[43:52.93]His face is gonna be right there.
[43:54.13]His fucking scary face.
[44:00.05]Go.
[44:08.21]Sickness here.
[44:10.03]God bless.
[44:11.67]Now, let's review the footage.
[44:19.24]Yeah.
[44:23.36]And take a look at Ladies and Gentlemen.
[44:28.40]Ladies and Gentlemen, where are we right now?
[44:34.05]We're in a swamp.
[44:37.55]People are trying to tell me From Software didn't have anything to do with this game.
[44:40.66]Poison Swamp.
[44:43.24]Poison Swamp.
[44:45.76]People are trying to tell me that From Software didn't have something to do with this game.
[44:50.90]You guys have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
[44:59.27]The mines were just a swamp all along.
[45:02.53]Welcome to this place of spiritual healing.
[45:04.05]Here's another thing.
[45:04.92]I wish I didn't have to have my...
[45:10.81]Who cares?
[45:12.59]If you guys want to read a book, I'll go get like an R.L.
[45:15.33]Stine fucking Stephen King book.
[45:19.08]Do you want me to re- See?
[45:23.54]This is Dark Souls!
[45:24.82]This guy- This is Dark Souls!
[45:29.24]You guys didn't fucking think it was!
[45:31.60]This is like a holo!
[45:33.91]See?
[45:34.87]It's a random fucking bunch of holos.
[45:37.69]This exists in Dark Souls 3.
[45:39.83]This exact spot, this exact enemy placement is in Dark Souls 3.
[45:44.65]Go see it.
[45:45.39]It's the fucking... It's not Farron.
[45:49.36]The place where you like the three beacons.
[45:51.36]Here it is.
[45:53.76]Where... Yeah.
[46:06.44]Get out of here.
[46:08.18]Lock this shit.
[46:10.97]Yeah, Farron.
[46:11.61]This is just Farron.
[46:12.67]This is Farron Keep.
[46:15.21]So Farron.
[46:16.27]Yeah, Farron.
[46:21.87]Wait, how did you get in here?
[46:28.82]How did you get in here?
[46:29.98]Were you with this person in here?
[46:34.47]Did I just lock myself in there with this person?
[46:38.71]Oh my god, what?
[46:42.61]Hold on, there was somebody in here.
[46:43.83]No, that... Okay, there was somebody in there.
[46:47.05]Why did they take... Oh no, somebody just puked on me.
[46:57.70]These people aren't even monsters.
[47:00.92]They just had a night out drinking.
[47:03.01]Alright, but wasn't there something?
[47:03.79]There's a battery in here.
[47:05.97]Okay, goodbye.
[47:07.14]Okay, goodbye.
[47:09.26]Okay, goodbye.
[47:11.52]Goodbye, you fucking hollows.
[47:13.58]Please just move out of the way so I can get around you.
[47:18.28]Hey, hey, hey!
[47:21.23]Get the guy puking on camera, quick!
[47:30.54]Who the fuck are you?
[47:31.40]Who the fuck are you?
[47:32.76]Who the fuck are you?
[47:33.70]Who is this random guy?
[47:34.68]This random like fucking DayZ character?
[47:39.36]There's too many games being combined.
[47:42.72]That guy's playing DayZ.
[47:44.10]We're in Farron Keep right now.
[47:45.68]I'm playing Resident Evil 4.
[47:49.56]There's a person in here, right?
[47:50.54]Yeah, there is.
[47:53.34]You're not gonna stand up, are you?
[47:57.48]Don't stand up.
[47:58.78]Just fucking sit there.
[48:01.12]Give me a second.
[48:03.00]There's too many games being played.
[48:09.38]Okay.
[48:17.96]Jesus.
[48:19.95]Jesus.
[48:24.69]Jesus.
[48:27.96]Jesus!
[48:28.83]Who's doing that?
[48:29.93]Somebody here?
[48:31.61]Who's doing that?
[48:32.21]Alright, there's a new scary guy.
[48:42.54]Where do I go from here?
[48:47.36]What?
[48:55.67]What?
[48:55.93]Why does it keep doing that noise?
[49:03.11]Why is it doing the inception noise?
[49:14.04]Why did the game get way better?
[49:15.52]You know what I mean?
[49:16.04]Like, what happened in the first three hours of the game?
[49:17.88]Look at how I adjust my glasses.
[49:29.95]This guy's, like, waiting for me.
[49:34.49]This guy was just sitting there waiting for me to come by him.
[49:38.05]I'll get him.
[49:38.49]I'll sneak him up.
[49:39.37]When he comes by, I'll get him.
[49:50.58]He just fucking punched me in the face.
[50:00.42]I had to.
[50:01.00]I had to do that.
[50:14.62]That's so funny.
[50:15.98]He just, like, backhanded me and killed me.
[50:19.62]He's gonna get up.
[50:20.82]That's very obvious.
[50:21.92]He's very obviously going to try to get me.
[50:24.39]Wait, let me do what he's doing.
[50:26.89]This will be fun.
[50:29.15]I'm gonna, like, sneak up on him now.
[50:34.23]No, move.
[50:35.09]What are you doing?
[50:38.29]Okay, ready?
[50:40.13]I'm gonna do what he's doing.
[50:51.88]And guess what?
[50:52.44]Yeah.
[50:53.14]I respawned at the bonfire.
[50:54.78]You're right.
[50:55.28]Here he comes.
[50:56.00]No more jokes.
[50:56.60]Just... Wait, is it... Help me!
[51:17.57]Help me!
[51:20.58]Do something!
[51:21.86]Do something!
[51:25.84]Alright, it's okay.
[51:26.62]We're both sharing the tent together.
[51:28.58]It's okay.
[51:33.98]It's alright.
[51:43.98]Thank you.
[51:44.38]Oh!
[51:47.70]Let me, like, rub your back for a minute.
[51:49.02]Okay.
[51:49.92]Thank you for doing that.
[51:50.88]Thank you for your help.
[51:51.68]I appreciate that.
[51:53.10]Uh, now I'm gonna go.
[51:55.18]It's been real.
[51:57.50]It's been real!
[51:58.92]But it's time to go!
[52:00.01]Just fucking running in the goddamn woods.
[52:04.63]I don't even know where I'm running to.
[52:06.19]Bonfire!
[52:07.19]Checkpoint!
[52:08.43]Sneak in here!
[52:22.10]Am I, like, just reliving the days when I was, like, bullied and stuffed in lockers?
[52:31.14]Didn't sit at the bonfire.
[52:33.19]That's right.
[52:33.65]I didn't sit at the bonfire, so now I have to activate this shortcut.
[52:44.49]We're talking fucking comedy right now.
[52:56.97]What happened?
[52:59.06]What's on his computer?
[53:00.00]Oh, God, what's on the computer?
[53:01.90]Here comes the big reveal.
[53:02.88]Ready?
[53:04.02]Huge reveal.
[53:06.22]The big reveal is he was playing Wolfenstein.
[53:09.88]Unbelievable.
[53:18.97]Father... Whoa, he's telling me he's worried.
[53:24.51]Embarrassing.
[53:25.03]What obvious permission slip.
[53:42.46]That just scared the shit out of me.
[53:45.46]Okay, I looked over here and I thought like Thing was in the room with me.
[53:52.80]From fucking Fantastic Four.
[53:56.61]Right?
[53:56.89]That's Thing from Fantastic Four over there.
[54:01.47]He's supposed to be like, hey, bud.
[54:14.62]You're a big dude, I know, seriously.
[54:16.26]Here comes the scary, scary sounds.
[54:23.52]Watch out, there's a fucking syringe.
[54:27.49]You know what kind of fucked up stuff they're doing when there's a goddamn fucking syringe on the table.
[54:33.20]And it's a wooden syringe.
[54:38.64]Two syringes.
[54:39.26]It's fucking terrifying.
[54:41.30]Okay.
[54:58.81]Anything else?
[55:21.96]Don't do it.
[55:22.48]You're gonna do it.
[55:23.36]I know you are.
[55:23.90]I know you are, but what am I?
[55:25.92]Climb up there.
[55:26.45]Can I get up there?
[55:29.10]Looks like I can grab that, doesn't it?
[55:30.84]Where's that glass?
[55:32.28]Fuck, they thought of everything.
[55:34.98]They thought of everything.
[55:37.82]Jammed.
[55:40.42]I guess I'm going to go this way.
[55:47.51]Okay.
[55:53.25]Okay.
[55:54.97]This is kind of where I was before, isn't it?
[55:59.74]Who is jamming the doors, by the way?
[56:01.16]Why are all these doors connected by, like, fucking Wi-Fi?
[56:06.08]Toilet.
[56:06.84]Nice.
[56:08.72]That's a really fucked up bathroom.
[56:10.26]Okay.
[56:11.94]Shouldn't these be on the ground?
[56:13.32]I feel like this bathroom is upside down.
[56:18.67]Alright, it's gonna happen.
[56:19.97]Person.
[56:24.64]Somebody had fucking like diarrhea.
[56:27.22]Why am I filming this?
[56:29.00]Why did you come into a public bathroom?
[56:31.56]Alright, you know what I'm gonna do today?
[56:32.72]Today is a good day.
[56:34.73]I'm gonna take my handy cam and I'm gonna go film like people that didn't flush the toilet in public bathrooms and videotape it.
[56:42.29]Yeah, that's how I do my fucking Saturday.
[56:44.83]Wow, that looks like fucking Mexican food.
[56:48.48]Like, what the fuck am I doing?
[56:52.00]Why would I be doing this?
[56:57.56]Better check the bathrooms.
[56:59.96]Better see what the bathrooms have in store.
[57:07.18]That's the cafeteria.
[57:08.58]Oh, here we go.
[57:13.39]Fuck.
[57:13.87]Oh.
[57:14.59]All right, quick.
[57:16.87]Quick, footage.
[57:17.41]I swear to God, I just filmed this.
[57:19.93]I can't believe it.
[57:20.47]I just did this.
[57:21.05]Okay, nothing there.
[57:27.87]What do we got?
[57:30.68]Just a bunch of fucking syringes.
[57:32.00]And this is messed up, man.
[57:36.10]Look at all these fucking syringes and shit.
[57:37.70]Like, this is bad.
[57:40.46]And saw blades?
[57:41.32]Are you shitting me?
[57:45.38]This is seriously freaking me out.
[57:58.63]No batteries in here?
[57:59.51]Come on.
[58:11.76]Nothing?
[58:12.28]Why?
[58:12.72]These rooms don't even need to be... I would rather just not be able to open them.
[58:24.87]I'm gonna get fucking grabbed.
[58:26.77]I'm just getting ready to get grabbed, guys.
[58:28.43]This is what happens in this area.
[58:33.65]Finally, a battery.
[58:35.03]It only took like seven years.
[58:50.62]That looks like somebody I know.
[58:57.13]Looks like me.
[59:06.30]Whatever.
[59:07.84]There we go.
[59:10.80]I don't even know why I keep going in these side rooms.
[59:12.60]There's like nothing ever in them besides like a bandage that like there is something in them apparently.
[59:28.43]Oh my god.
[59:30.19]Is there something in here I needed?
[59:31.21]Alright.
[59:36.05]They're doing this because they're dragging out you going into these rooms.
[59:39.37]Because there's a huge scare when you open up the last door.
[59:41.93]I mean, that's just... That's textbook.
[59:44.55]That's textbook horror game.
[59:48.28]See?
[59:48.52]Like, there's a lot of boring shit and all of a sudden... Ta-da!

[62:46.73]I could get up from this.
[62:58.81]I could get up from this.
[63:00.57]I could move.
[63:02.19]I could.
[63:04.45]Get up.
[63:05.01]Left hand.
[63:05.49]Okay.

[63:27.57]That point I'm safe.
[63:31.08]Well, old Nick, I guess we better put those nails in.
[63:35.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[63:41.72]Tough guy in a muscle shirt.
[63:42.96]Good, good.
[63:52.21]That wasn't so bad, was it?
[63:54.25]I'm just like ruining this whole thing.
[63:55.79]I'm sorry.
[63:57.81]What's this?
[64:00.76]Hear me there?
[64:02.10]Is that a camera?
[64:04.06]A record?
[64:05.90]Of course.
[64:08.30]How could I not see it?
[64:09.87]A modern Christ would use a camera, not a book.
[64:13.73]This is our gospel.
[64:17.31]How could I not have known?
[64:22.18]Forgive me for telling you.
[64:24.10]There is no suffering that I do not deserve.
[64:28.29]I am a worm.
[64:30.15]There's the worm.
[64:36.69]I must study his lessons.
[64:43.20]Drive the other nail in and hang him.
[64:45.36]No!
[64:45.92]No!
[64:46.54]No!
[64:46.94]No!
[64:54.58]It doesn't feel like Outlast.
[64:55.90]It just doesn't.
[64:59.01]This doesn't feel like a continuation of Outlast.
[65:03.15]And I understand that that's not what they were going for, I guess.
[65:07.47]But this feels like a completely different series.
[65:11.04]This doesn't even feel like the same series.
[65:17.30]Does that make sense?
[65:17.92]Is that my problem with Outlast 2?
[65:22.05]Is this is like... This doesn't even feel like it's made by... It's just a completely different... Almost like a completely different genre.
[65:32.19]It's like not a genre.
[65:33.43]It's like feels too Resident Evil.
[65:34.67]It feels like all like the weird monster people.
[65:36.81]There was like one monster guy in... I mean Outlast was scary because the people were scary.
[65:46.15]I feel like these like monster people is just... Feels too much like they're like Resident Evil 4.
[66:00.05]I feel like they could have done a lot more with, um... Hold on, I'm gonna die.
[66:05.91]They could have done a lot more with the theme here.
[66:07.39]I feel like it's just, watch out for the monsters!
[66:11.00]I don't have my camera.
[66:12.72]I don't have any bandages.
[66:17.18]I hear somebody else.
[66:18.22]Alright, get to the bonfire.
[66:22.54]Wait, where's this guy?
[66:23.30]What?
[66:25.70]What?
[66:26.06]What?
[66:31.49]I'm just gonna die.
[66:32.79]I like- Okay, where- Where am I?
[66:35.35]Am I inside of a bag?
[66:36.81]What am I doing?
[66:37.47]What happened?
[66:41.75]Where am I?
[66:42.41]I'm- We're inside this guy.
[67:02.64]I just saw his eyes.
[67:03.66]We're in his mouth.
[67:05.01]We're inside this guy's mouth.
[67:10.94]Whose mouth are we in?
[67:39.39]Okay, I'm gonna have to reload the game, I think.
[67:49.65]Alright, uh... I hope to, I really hope to... Get me out!
[67:59.76]Get out!
[68:10.05]I have no idea what that was, by the way.
[68:12.68]Where's that going to put... I don't want it to put me somewhere fucking weird, though.
[68:19.48]How far back is this going to put me?
[68:20.62]I hope not that far.
[68:26.14]I don't want to save and exit, though.
[68:30.04]If I save and exit, is it going to keep me right fucking here?
[68:33.32]Change the save slot.
[68:35.27]New save.
[68:35.87]Like, I don't understand.
[68:38.37]Like, what...
[68:43.01]I'm actually scared about this right now.
[68:47.43]Load game.
[68:49.07]Right here, right?
[68:55.26]Yeah, okay.
[68:56.32]We got it.
[68:56.70]That was really weird, don't ask me.
[69:06.77]Do I think this game... No, this game wasn't influenced by Resident Evil 7, but...
[69:14.43]It's definitely, it just, it feels like it was influenced by Resident Evil 4.
[69:19.47]Religious cult kind of stuff.
[69:22.75]Weird, uh, out in like the, out in like the swamp.
[69:27.18]Same imagery, like the churches and shit.
[69:33.82]Okay, there's a bandage over there.
[69:42.17]Let's just get over there.
[69:49.00]There we go.
[69:49.50]I'm trying to use the bandage apparently.
[69:54.52]That's not how you do it.
[69:59.85]That was the bad ending.
[70:03.21]It's taking a long time.
[70:04.37]Hopefully I'm in a good spot.
[70:05.55]Alright.
[70:14.98]We don't have the camera though.
[70:16.14]So which way?
[70:16.76]Left or right?
[70:17.54]I don't know.
[70:20.26]I'm gonna... I don't think it's that way.
[70:25.32]We're gonna go this way.
[70:30.18]Anything else?
[70:32.02]I mean, there's like bandages here.
[70:33.34]Okay.
[70:44.81]I guess I'm fully healed.
[70:45.77]Enough at least.
[70:53.69]Gotta stop the bleeding somehow.
[71:02.57]I guess I have to follow the guy coughing.
[71:05.45]I guess.
[71:10.02]God damn it.
[71:23.93]Where the hell are these people?
[71:29.13]Over there.
[71:36.37]Can I make this jump?
[71:37.31]Okay, good.
[71:42.02]Got a save point.
[71:42.72]That's good.
[71:46.42]I just heard somebody open a bathroom stall.
[71:55.70]I gotta get my camera back.
[71:57.96]Hey, Angry Alan.
[71:58.68]Thank you for the two bucks.

[85:49.92]Alright, I'm not doing that.
[85:51.72]He's in the fucking bathroom.
[85:53.34]Yeah, so hold on.
[85:54.34]So he was the one taking all these gross shits.
[85:57.50]Keep that in mind, guys.

[86:25.61]Okay.
[86:26.09]I don't even know where I'm supposed to run to.

[86:42.62]Alright.
[86:45.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[86:45.94]Go this way.
[86:48.91]I'm going to keep going this way.
[86:53.24]I think you gotta follow the decision- Wait, wait, what?
[86:56.40]How did he get there?
[86:57.34]How did he- How did he get there?
[87:01.30]What?
[87:01.94]What?
[87:14.71]I like- Wait, what happened to like the- Oh my god, this is just like- This is fucking annoying.
[87:30.20]Should I go in the locker?
[87:31.32]I think I have to go in the locker.
[87:39.28]Yeah, okay.
[87:40.00]Now I'm in this closet.
[87:45.99]What?
[87:48.55]Don't ever read Latin.
[87:52.69]Latin is not something you want to read.
[87:56.20]There's nothing so wretched among the afflicted.
[87:58.14]Even that noise.
[87:59.78]When you pick up a piece of paper.
[88:01.56]Sounds like Resident Evil.
[88:04.10]That like end of the piano noise.
[88:05.90]That like.
[88:06.64]I don't even need this right now.
[88:17.69]Okay, well.
[88:27.42]Am I gonna close this door?
[88:28.55]That would be smart, I think.
[88:30.65]That would be fairly smart.
[88:35.56]Giving me a lot of batteries.
[89:00.97]He's right over there.
[89:01.69]But where am I... Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[89:03.27]That was an outhouse.
[89:19.92]I guess I'm just gonna... Can I go over here?
[89:21.82]Not really.
[89:28.26]Not really...
[89:40.83]I love how he points.
[89:47.59]He's like, go that way, my minion.
[89:51.73]Really?
[90:06.97]Can't even go that way.
[90:07.73]There was like barbed wire in the fucking way.
[90:13.50]I can't go this way either.
[90:14.44]Where the fuck are they?
[90:33.87]Where are they?
[90:36.61]Over right there?
[90:37.33]I can't even see that way.
[90:59.89]They're like there now.
[91:09.27]What?
[91:14.31]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[91:15.27]Apparently over here.
[91:19.09]Oh, fuck me.
[91:25.84]It's right here.
[91:35.09]Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.
[91:38.82]Go!
[91:41.66]Go!
[91:42.40]Eat the carrot!
[91:42.86]What are you doing?
[91:47.80]Don't even look.
[91:55.08]We're good.
[92:01.58]Okay.
[92:10.63]Am I going this way?
[92:13.03]Apparently.
[92:17.31]Where are you?
[92:18.21]What?
[92:19.37]What?
[92:21.33]How did you get that far up, by the way?
[92:23.43]I'm gonna get hit right in the face.
[92:27.97]Okay, he got me.
[92:29.65]Nice shot.
[92:30.19]Fucking asshole.
[92:38.53]Oh, come on.
[92:41.50]Where is he?
[92:43.88]This guy's too good of a shot, you know, if I'm honest.
[92:47.00]Come on, do it.
[92:48.54]Do it.
[92:50.61]Do it.
[92:51.09]There he comes.
[92:52.49]Go.
[93:06.59]What the fuck?
[93:07.15]Get off me.
[93:11.26]This guy's just in his tent.
[93:14.20]Where?
[93:15.84]God.
[93:16.28]I just fell backwards.
[93:21.30]I'm gonna heal.
[93:21.78]I don't have any bandages, I don't think, do I?
[93:25.94]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[93:32.82]We're really playing this game right now where I have to just not get hit by the fucking arrows.
[93:37.16]Really.
[93:38.64]Go ahead, shoot another one.
[93:40.60]Go on.
[93:41.42]Oh my lord.
[93:51.84]Shoot it.
[93:54.80]Shoot it!
[93:56.86]Shoot it!
[93:59.22]Shoot the arrow.
[94:00.68]Shoot...
[94:15.50]I fucking could have known that was going to happen.
[94:17.04]I'm just staying low on the ground.
[94:18.61]We're just crawling.
[94:28.81]Come on.
[94:29.64]Hurry up.
[94:30.00]Get up there.
[94:41.07]What?
[94:41.93]Wait, what?
[94:49.15]What happened to this person's voice?
[94:53.63]Alright, I'm still getting arrow shot at me too, by the way.
[94:59.78]SLIDE!
[95:00.72]Okay, good.
[95:02.84]SLIDE again!
[95:04.02]Heal.
[95:06.52]What the f- how the fuck are you still behind me?
[95:10.56]Oh my god, seriously, like, I thought I was getting shot at still, and I'm gonna die here.
[95:23.47]Like, legitimately thought the arrows were still coming at me.
[95:25.79]No, it's just this fucking piece of shit that is just always right behind me.
[95:30.46]Always.
[95:32.82]Like, fucking God.
[95:34.36]Oh, I'm scary.
[95:36.26]No, you're annoying.
[95:38.58]Look at how annoying you are.
[95:43.73]I'm fucking running into cactuses.
[95:53.77]Fuck, he's gone.
[95:54.17]Going into a coffin.
[95:57.77]Wow.
[96:21.73]Sorry about that The dark dark souls to see that like little play with the very beginning of the game when you come out I
[96:49.45]I'm actually getting buried alive and I'm gonna end up in the fucking school.
[96:57.79]I can't wait to wake up in a locker.
[97:00.67]It's gonna be so cool.
[97:01.73]I'm gonna wake up at like underneath the teacher's desk.
[97:03.75]I'm gonna like wake up on a desk like I was sleeping in the middle of class.
[97:40.56]Wow, no school.
[97:44.57]No school.
[97:45.63]Oh, that, like, hurt my head.
[97:57.62]Okay.
[97:59.34]Uh, over here.
[98:00.44]I guess.
[98:11.19]There's something over there.
[98:14.39]Yep.
[98:14.49]Dead person.
[98:16.25]Scary dead person over there.
[98:18.91]Doing like the scary golem run.
[98:20.95]Yep.
[98:24.81]Slide.
[98:26.05]That was sick.
[98:27.57]Okay.
[98:28.59]Don't anybody ever tell me that I wasn't able to do something that sick.
[98:31.83]Ever.
[98:32.19]Because I will show you that clip.
[98:53.40]She hanged herself before I could stop her.
[98:56.62]Or she... did it.
[98:58.22]No.
[98:59.28]Wait, not her.
[99:01.63]He... Fuck.
[99:03.87]Guy's having some trouble.
[99:07.41]Want me to tie a rope walking this or what?
[99:10.79]I guess not.
[99:13.91]Hole in fence.
[99:14.91]Place to jump.
[99:20.53]I think.
[99:21.15]Yeah.
[99:24.71]This game makes me sick.
[99:27.70]It is very, very gory.
[99:29.10]I will give you that.
[99:30.12]It's a gory game.
[99:36.04]It's very quiet, though.
[99:37.00]I don't necessarily like that.
[99:43.03]Slide again.
[99:43.81]Oh.
[99:43.87]I was about to jump.
[99:56.40]That's a much safer way.
[99:58.12]Oh god, I do have to jump.
[100:04.28]Made it.
[100:07.66]More reading.
[100:11.01]Sorry I had to take the rope from off this pulley because I needed to climb to heaven.
[100:15.53]Haha.
[100:16.65]If that bloated Ezekiel won't give you no more rope, you can cut me down and take it back as I expect I'll be done with it.
[100:23.56]That's the guy that was hanging himself outside.
[100:26.46]Go cut that rope down.
[100:27.50]Okay.
[100:40.63]Where the fuck do I get out of here then?
[100:43.25]I need a rope, so... I can't go down there.
[100:55.12]Can I just, I guess I can jump through here?
[100:57.00]Great.
[101:14.77]How many people are there?
[101:17.43]I don't know.
[101:19.16]Ow, my finger.
[101:19.92]Finger, finger.
[101:29.50]I hear somebody.
[101:38.73]Somebody right, somebody in this outhouse.
[101:45.50]Don't crouch.
[101:46.12]What are you fucking thinking?
[101:56.80]Somebody is going to the bathroom.
[102:01.84]Come on.
[102:17.01]How do I get up there?
[102:28.74]Do it!
[102:30.82]Do it!
[102:31.28]She's gonna be right fucking behind me.
[102:38.50]Nope, I'm okay.
[102:42.68]There's the rope.
[102:55.53]Somebody right here.
[102:56.51]That guy's right there.
[103:04.76]I gotta just get the rope and run.
[103:06.00]Which way is it?
[103:06.60]I don't fucking even remember.

[104:31.43]Is he dead?
[104:31.93]Oh, God.
[104:37.10]Quick, film him.
[104:41.12]This guy's death was terrible.
[104:47.86]I hope he's not dead, because that was awful.
[104:50.92]He just fell down.
[104:53.29]My dad died within a month of my mom.
[104:55.35]What is that?
[104:56.09]He was perfectly healthy until she was gone.
[104:59.01]And... What does that have to do with what I just filmed?
[105:06.52]What does that have to do with the thing I just filmed?
[105:10.28]You know, my dad died.
[105:12.38]Like, what?
[105:15.58]That's sort of a weird place for that.
[105:18.46]But, you know, whatever.
[105:19.93]Okay.
[105:20.05]Okay.
[105:23.88]Alrighty.
[105:25.44]He's gonna grab me.
[105:27.69]I know he is.
[105:28.27]He's not dead.
[105:31.27]He's definitely alive.
[105:34.87]My fucking ear hurts.
[105:39.73]Now we're in like a research facility.
[105:42.26]Fuck.
[105:49.90]Something's behind me.
[105:53.13]No, somebody, where?
[105:54.13]I feel somebody.
[105:59.91]We're back at the research facility, the school.
[106:02.17]Up here?
[106:11.40]Apparently, I guess, maybe?
[106:15.94]I have batteries, right?
[106:24.03]I don't think in these, like, weird flashback segments... I really don't think in these, like, odd flashy back segments that you should use battery.
[106:33.47]That feels kind of cheap to me.
[106:35.51]You know?
[106:36.41]It's like, if this is some kind of weird flashback... Why am I using battery?
[106:42.40]Maybe I haven't been paying any attention to that.
[106:45.02]Who knows?
[106:47.32]See, I told you.
[106:47.82]Fucking guy's playing Wolfenstein.
[106:50.30]We're just in the computer right now.
[106:53.00]I figured it out.
[106:54.85]Yep.
[106:55.67]We are inside of the computer.
[107:04.95]What's going on right now?
[107:16.89]There he is.
[107:17.25]Okay.

[108:07.58]Um... Okay.
[108:12.22]Like, I feel like I have to go in there, but how come I can't open the door?
[108:33.31]What the fuck is this?
[108:34.21]Dude, that is like... I thought that was... You know how the panels have fallen from the ceiling and landed on the ground like four times now?
[108:54.31]I thought that was just some random ceiling panel.

[109:43.06]It's gonna happen here very shortly.
[109:55.00]No, that wasn't... We're not ready for pogchamps.
[109:56.56]I have to do something cool.
[109:57.59]I've done a lot of cool things in a row, though, guys.
[109:59.73]Please, like...
[110:02.05]I mean, as a streamer here, as a streamer on Twitch TV, you've got some memories here, right?
[110:08.43]You've got a couple of good quality gameplay memories from this stream.

[110:57.34]Got her.
[110:58.36]Where is she?
[111:27.17]Where did she go?
[111:27.87]Oh my god.
[111:31.13]What's wrong with me?
[111:55.12]She's right here.
[111:55.78]Ghost self.
[111:59.88]Let me look at my fucking watch and see where that is.
[112:14.39]Oh yeah, my compass is telling me to go that way.
[112:17.59]There's no compass.
[112:21.63]Get those fucking pogchamps ready.
[112:41.18]Lake.
[112:41.32]Gotta get to the other side of the lake.
[112:53.67]Rhymes with Blake.
[112:55.23]I'll remember that, because that's my name.
[112:57.54]Gotta get to the side of the Blake.
[113:01.56]Car okay.
[113:03.14]Oh, no, this that's not a car.
[113:05.00]I thought that was a car.
[113:06.24]It's coming this way Blake rhymes with quake Rhymes of take my name is Blake steak What am I filming who cares about this The lake smelled like chemicals and dead
[113:37.08]No, what am I doing?
[113:37.96]Don't go in the alligator-infested water.
[113:40.36]Blake... Blake steak.
[113:43.15]Yeah, get some Blake steak.
[113:44.31]That's what I'm gonna be soon enough.
[113:47.83]Great joke.
[113:54.63]Did you just come into my stream and tell me great joke?
[114:02.52]For life!
[114:08.74]That guy for life!
[114:16.66]Now we have to go to the dock, right?
[114:22.11]Battery.
[114:22.95]Cool.
[114:23.33]Watch.
[114:23.95]In Resident Evil 4, here comes the giant alligator monster.
[114:27.27]Right?
[114:29.33]Jerma doesn't take compliments well.
[114:34.40]I don't!
[114:38.34]Should I go in?
[114:40.60]It's probably a bad idea.
[114:41.54]I should be able to get in here, right?
[114:49.09]It's locked, but there's gotta be a way inside.
[114:51.11]It's a psycho.
[114:57.14]I'm just gonna go in the water and see what happens.
[115:03.22]I know, there's a house over there.
[115:04.46]I'm gonna go check out that house.
[115:07.01]Or I'll just get stuck in the wood, you know, no big deal.
[115:14.82]House two.
[115:15.66]Does house two open?
[115:17.60]No.
[115:20.78]Go to the lake and go breathe in some chemicals in the lake.
[115:25.55]This one opens.
[115:26.81]Okay.
[115:31.71]Streamer loses it on stream.
[115:35.37]Lost it.
[115:36.59]Uh...
[115:37.39]Hate to burst everybody's bubble here, but I lost it a long time ago.
[115:43.28]And there was no reason to even come in this house.
[115:47.22]Okay, great.
[115:49.28]Great.
[115:49.78]Okay, good.
[115:56.24]I guess there was a reason to come in this house, because now I can go up here.
[116:02.68]Get the fuck up here, man.
[116:06.61]I hear, like, a new monster.
[116:08.23]A new, like, bird creature.
[116:12.02]What the fuck?
[116:20.06]No, shit!
[116:26.14]If there was a selfie mode in this game, that'd be fucking awesome.
[116:33.78]Yeah, what do you have to say about that?
[116:38.98]Maybe.
[116:45.37]You know, maybe, Blake.
[116:47.79]Maybe.
[116:49.25]Upstairs.
[116:51.97]Anybody want any, like, fucking chicken?
[116:55.77]Guy's gonna be at the very top.
[116:58.11]Scary guy, right?
[117:05.53]Why is this here?
[117:07.59]This exists to jump over, you know?
[117:10.67]Great.
[117:19.08]Whatever.
[117:21.68]I'm not gonna jump.
[117:22.52]Are you serious?
[117:23.30]Jump?
[117:24.98]I'm not jumping that.
[117:30.90]I have to just go around.
[117:33.84]This game is a series of go-around events.
[117:35.90]I'm gonna make this jump.
[117:42.44]I am gonna jump!
[117:43.32]Look!
[117:44.98]See?
[117:45.20]I jumped.
[118:06.78]Okay, we're good.
[118:10.04]They're all running this way.
[118:13.66]Why?
[118:13.90]Is it like dinner time or something?
[118:18.77]I don't understand.
[118:26.35]Just in case.
[118:28.95]Anything in here?
[118:30.23]Anything at all?
[118:32.70]I mean, there's a note, but who cares.
[118:34.78]If you find this head, straight back to the temple gate, and tell Papa not there is horror and torment here that test even my faith in God.
[118:41.38]Men alone cannot face it.
[118:42.26]The enemy waits in the darkness here.
[118:43.58]God save my soul and yours.
[118:49.11]So there was nothing really in here.
[118:50.19]There's just a fucking note.
[118:51.73]Alright, well, whatever.
[119:00.20]Shit, what the fuck was that?
[119:02.66]A raft!
[119:03.98]I'm getting on like a piece of wood.
[119:08.97]Oh god, don't even tell me, I have to like swim with this.
[119:12.51]Use W to paddle, A and D to steer the raft.
[119:14.97]Well put down the fucking camera.
[119:18.35]God, this is gonna be such a fucking nightmare.
[119:35.56]Sucks.
[119:36.90]I'm on like the back of a... I'm on like the thing that... What's his name?
[119:40.74]Jack in Titanic?
[119:42.94]Didn't that guy die?
[119:45.17]Sorry, I just spoiled Titanic for you.
[119:47.05]Like the movie Titanic.
[119:50.09]Doesn't he like die on one of these things?
[119:53.13]Oh, great.
[119:53.83]No, I can't see anything.
[119:54.87]Where's the audio?
[120:02.74]This is not... Nothing about this is safe.
[120:07.19]I swear to God, if a deranged mutant alligator shows up.
[120:13.17]You hear that?
[120:14.11]Yeah, of course.
[120:14.97]It's red and blue all over again, I told you.
[120:21.99]I see, like, here it is.
[120:24.66]Yeah.
[120:28.42]There he is.
[120:28.98]He's like the fucking monster in the lake.
[120:31.02]There's the multiple monsters in the lake.
[120:34.58]These are all fish.
[120:35.40]Okay, well, all the fish died.
[120:37.43]These are signs of the apocalypse.
[120:39.95]Signs of the apocalypse?
[120:41.05]For God, I'm just losing my shit.
[120:43.43]Should I film the fish?
[120:45.63]No.
[120:57.30]Don't wake up in the school.
[120:58.82]Don't wake up in the school.
[120:59.98]I didn't think about the school.
[121:02.80]Do I have to get back to the raft?
[121:08.44]Alright, get back to the raft.
[121:09.47]Everything's fine.
[121:10.19]You just had a bad dream.
[121:19.69]Get back on the raft.
[121:21.33]Come on, you can do it.
[121:24.23]Get up there.
[121:25.75]Get up there.
[121:29.44]Tap left mouse button repeatedly.
[121:33.64]Please don't wake up in this... Where the hell am I?
[121:37.35]Am I going the right way?
[121:42.01]I can't do anything.
[121:43.29]Alright, can you please move?
[121:51.58]This isn't doing anything.
[121:59.04]I can't move, apparently.
[122:02.22]I no longer am able to steer the fucking boat.
[122:05.48]I guess I am.
[122:10.47]Oh my god.
[122:15.25]Whatever.
[122:15.65]I'm just like crashing into shit.
[122:25.02]I'm gonna go over like, we're gonna go over the dam.
[122:27.12]We're gonna go down the waterfall.
[122:33.40]We're just gonna go over the waterfall and I'm gonna die.
[122:38.10]I'm actually probably better off swimming at this point.
[122:47.65]I would be so injured right now.
[122:55.35]Alright.
[122:56.66]We're almost there.
[122:57.78]We're going much faster now.
[123:02.88]We're going really fast, actually.
[123:07.36]Who the fuck is that?
[123:13.88]Oh, they're all coming to get me.
[123:26.11]Where am I going now?
[123:27.31]Why am I going backwards?
[123:36.85]Why am I going backwards?
[123:40.48]I'm not almost there.
[123:41.12]I'm going the other way.
[123:43.42]Turn around.
[123:43.94]Wait.
[123:48.06]Should I be going this way?
[123:49.30]What's that?
[123:49.78]What is that?
[123:50.68]Who is that?
[124:18.72]What are they doing?
[124:23.70]They burnt that guy.
[124:27.72]They were waiting for me to see that.
[124:33.47]Yeah, this is just a really bad theme park ride.
[124:40.45]It's a hollow.
[124:50.46]I mean, this is kind of taking me... I'm not going to complain about it.
[125:00.22]But I feel like this entire sequence could have just been a small cutscene.
[125:08.03]Like, this whole boat raft sequence could have been just a small cutscene.
[125:13.05]Because it really is just an entire annoying scripted whole W event.
[125:21.76]It's like somebody's screaming at me now over here.
[125:30.89]You need the whole fun amusement park ride, though.
[125:33.25]It's true.
[125:34.85]That's true.
[125:39.35]I hear the audio cue.
[125:41.49]Somebody's on the boat.
[125:42.79]Somebody's gonna be on the boat shortly.
[125:45.71]Someone's gonna jump off the cliff and land on me.
[125:47.95]We're going real fast now.
[125:49.05]Okay, this is where I get my gamer skills.
[125:50.18]Get your pogchamps ready.
[126:02.49]And he manages to make it up safely.
[126:07.11]Shit.
[126:08.39]Shit, the raft.
[126:09.67]At least they'll be there.
[126:11.89]Wait.
[126:12.03]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[126:18.26]Like here?
[126:26.76]God damn it.
[126:31.30]Where is it?
[126:33.03]Right there.
[126:37.25]Oh shit.
[126:38.05]This is like a bad current.
[126:39.82]Oh no.
[126:51.85]What did I land on?
[126:53.03]What?
[126:54.25]What the fuck did I land on?
[126:58.22]Okay.
[127:00.08]I'm still not dead.
[127:02.08]Okay, the raft couldn't have gone far.
[127:04.76]I can still make it.
[127:08.62]Fucking scripted event.
[127:10.65]There.
[127:11.81]The raft.
[127:13.19]I can just...
[127:21.55]What the fuck?
[127:25.11]Motherfucking no.
[127:27.45]Motherfucking no.
[127:32.45]Oh, I get it.
[127:32.97]That's somebody's insides.
[127:36.41]Well, that's gross.
[127:39.00]Okay, what does he have to say?
[127:41.70]What if he just went, gross?
[127:43.88]Killed as a warning.
[127:46.20]We're welcome.
[127:47.46]No, that's too bad.
[127:48.28]We're all welcomed eventually.
[127:51.38]True.
[127:52.38]We sure are.
[127:54.37]Uh, I guess I have to go down.
[127:55.93]Over here.
[127:56.25]I hear a guy.
[128:23.47]fucking page I ain't I ain't reading that right now so that's I ain't gonna read that should I guys I'm should I go in here and like am I gonna grab the boat I think I can go in here and grab the boat right
[128:57.38]Alright, grab the boat.
[129:07.69]Why does this part of the game exist?
[129:10.71]This is not, like, Outlast.
[129:12.78]This is, like, annoying fucking river raft ride.
[129:15.54]Like, this is not, like, this is not fucking scary.
[129:19.90]This is just annoying.
[129:22.58]Why the fuck does this exist?
[129:23.86]Just let me fucking go to the next- This is- I don't want to play, like, River Raft Ride.
[129:27.75]I want to play Outlast.
[129:32.03]I'm not outlasting.
[129:37.10]Like, I don't- I don't want to do this.
[129:40.74]Like, holy shit from software.
[129:42.84]I'm not ma- I know, I'm making that joke, but who the fuck actually made this game?
[129:50.89]It's like, holy shit, this is so bad.
[129:58.03]I thought I was playing a fucking horror game.
[130:00.95]I would expect to play this in, like, the fucking forest.
[130:07.07]Nothing scary is happening.
[130:08.41]It's just, oh, I'm gonna walk around and go get the raft.
[130:12.46]Remember Outlast 1 when the guy was chasing you with fucking scissors in the insane asylum?
[130:21.65]Just run around in a fucking raft in this one.
[130:26.45]Isn't that scary?
[130:29.56]Look, there's intestines.
[130:30.70]Scary.
[130:44.75]I guess I have to keep going around?
[130:47.43]I don't fucking know.
[130:51.37]I... I just went around in a circle.
[130:53.65]I just went around in a circle.
[131:12.02]Don't kill me.
[131:13.34]Like, don't fucking have that kill me.
[131:17.72]I can't he's so dumb.
[131:18.84]I'm just like talking shit and walking around in circles.
[131:20.86]I'm not like I Look you you can see people you can say whatever you want.
[131:25.95]But like This part of the game is just fucking stupid.
[131:30.91]It just is It's just frustrating and dumb to have to like ride around in a raft for fucking seemingly no goddamn reason And now there's like another noise
[131:48.32]Do I have to climb this shit?
[131:49.92]I don't fucking have any idea.
[131:56.49]Where the fuck am I even supposed to go?
[131:57.97]I just have to get to that raft.
[132:01.11]Oh god.
[132:06.17]Because I can't go in that water.
[132:07.65]If I go in the water, I just lose.
[132:13.56]Is there a log I can traverse or something over here?
[132:30.55]Can I, like, knock a tree down?
[132:31.79]Oh my god.
[132:44.59]I'm just going around in another circle.
[133:10.20]Can't fucking believe this shit.
[133:13.28]This is a load of shit.
[133:21.45]Like, I guess I have to go up around there.
[133:22.97]Okay.
[133:35.18]Fucking god damn it, man.
[133:37.02]Fuck this game.
[133:46.99]Fuck Outlast 2, I'm gonna say it right now.
[133:51.77]Like, you heard it here.
[134:07.23]There goes that sponsorship.
[134:08.95]They took a cool idea in the first game and then made it a fucking, like, walk around the woods game.
[134:17.05]that has been done a thousand fucking times before.
[134:19.44]It's scary.
[134:30.09]Oh!
[134:34.99]I'm not playing the game.
[134:35.93]Look, that, okay, maybe I should have known I was supposed to push a tree down.
[134:39.01]Okay.
[134:40.69]What should have happened is I shouldn't be playing the forest.
[134:57.66]I don't want a fucking white water raft.
[135:00.80]This is like, I don't want to do this.
[135:06.94]Yeah, yeah, I am fucking salty because this is just fucking irritating.
[135:10.52]I don't want to do a fucking shitty Disney World ride.
[135:40.65]I'm just waiting to go over Splash Mountain.
[135:42.17]We're gonna, like, go over Splash Mountain.
[135:59.86]This is just a fucking forest!
[136:01.26]Look at this!
[136:01.68]The naked people running around when you- looking through the forest woods and shit.
[136:13.56]Go speedrun Late Chip.
[136:14.84]I mean, I might be complaining a lot, but like, honest to God, I loved Outlast 1.
[136:19.73]Outlast 1 is one of my favorite horror games ever fucking made.
[136:24.91]And then... We're going fast again.
[136:27.57]Hold on.
[136:27.93]We're going real fast.
[136:30.45]Like, here...
[136:39.23]What's happening?
[136:41.31]I have no control over the boat right now.
[136:43.17]I have three prongs now.
[136:46.27]I have a fork.
[136:47.57]Wait, a fork is four prongs.
[136:53.48]Outlast 1 wasn't that great either.
[136:55.32]Outlast 1 was fucking awesome.
[137:12.78]Dessert forks.
[137:18.79]Quit being salty.
[137:19.57]The game's good.
[137:20.99]Look, dude.
[137:21.51]I mean, like, I'm gonna be real honest with you here.
[137:23.81]Like, do you see what I'm doing right now?
[137:29.99]This sequence is, like, this has been just so dragged out.
[137:33.81]Just, like, go on the raft sequence.
[137:37.56]And now there's a fucking, like, there's a swamp thing in here now, apparently.
[137:40.34]There's, like, multiple swamp things.
[137:43.25]I guess I just have to wait over here.
[137:48.61]We're going for the ladder.
[137:49.99]Now I'm gonna grab by like the tongue monster.
[137:58.00]And we're gonna end up in the school.
[138:04.36]Wait.
[138:13.53]We were in like the gym.
[138:15.11]We were in the gym's pool.
[138:23.52]Can I get out of the pool?
[138:24.54]I don't actually know where I am.
[138:30.04]I think I'm in like...
[138:50.33]I guess we're gonna go this way?
[138:51.87]We gotta get to like the shallow end.
[139:00.89]Where is he?
[139:06.93]Nice waterproof camera, that's true.
[139:24.76]Don't open.
[139:31.32]This is the shallow end.
[139:32.26]Uh-oh.
[139:39.34]Somebody's in the bathroom doing something.
[139:40.82]No, it's just the sink is just messed up.
[139:44.30]No, blood coming out of the shower head.
[139:46.64]Damn.
[139:51.36]Somebody's smashing a door down, but I have to get this videotaped.
[140:03.10]That's gross.
[140:03.58]All right, I've seen enough of that.
[140:11.04]What about this one?
[140:11.88]No, it's just like cigarettes and piss on that one.
[140:18.67]Oh, that was disgusting.
[140:19.57]I don't know why I did that.
[140:23.23]Act like a pirate?
[140:24.03]What do you mean act like a pirate?
[140:28.26]He's coming!
[140:33.46]What about this one?
[140:35.79]Somebody in this bathroom?
[140:38.95]Oh, where's the blood in this one?
[140:52.72]Hmm... Well, there's the exit.
[140:58.36]And here comes Street Fighter guy, right?
[141:01.69]No, not quite.
[141:05.64]Bathroom inspector.
[141:12.39]Jammed.
[141:21.30]Locked.
[141:23.60]Open.
[141:24.72]Yeah, where is he?
[141:27.65]Where?
[141:27.99]There he is, there he is.
[141:34.42]No, that doesn't open.
[141:39.66]Oh, that didn't work.
[141:40.92]Oh, come on.
[141:46.25]Wet?
[141:49.99]Quick, go in the office break room!
[141:51.43]Nope, not gonna work.
[141:55.65]Okay, I guess we're going in here.
[142:02.37]Maybe I'm gonna have to hide in here.
[142:16.20]Battery, take it.
[142:27.55]Yeah?
[142:29.11]Hello?
[142:37.93]I don't hear, I don't see anything.
[142:39.03]There's too much blood.
[142:51.92]Blood everywhere.
[142:54.04]Oh god.
[143:09.72]Alright, I made it away from the blood.
[143:14.18]Look at my footprints.
[143:18.06]How unsanitary.
[143:19.06]You're right.
[143:23.58]Alright, we're back in reality, right?
[143:33.85]I guess.
[143:35.75]I don't know where the hell I ended up, but apparently we're...
[143:38.93]This is raining blood.
[143:42.11]I think I've lost my mind.
[143:47.15]How close would... We've got to be close to the end here, right?
[143:53.10]What do you got?
[143:54.90]It was raining blood.
[143:57.82]Dripping off her shoes.
[143:59.32]Dripping off her shoes.
[144:00.88]No.
[144:01.98]Just... I try not to step in the blood because I didn't want to leave tracks.
[144:07.52]This game is metal.
[144:11.58]Well, we're almost at like the... Just about like an hour away.
[144:17.82]Well, we're gonna finish it.
[144:20.16]Regardless of how I feel about it.
[144:21.51]And look, I did... You've heard me talk some shit.
[144:28.51]That's venting anger.
[144:31.09]But we are gonna finish this.
[144:33.07]I'm going to finish this game.
[144:34.07]I think we're that close.
[144:46.76]New monster.
[144:48.60]New monster type.
[145:05.62]How does this section... How does this section compare to the big boat level in Resident Evil 7?
[145:12.67]Well, here's the thing about Resident Evil 7, though.
[145:14.24]Resident Evil 7 was, like, a, like, 9.5 out of 10 for the first, like, 5 hours of the game.
[145:19.84]So... That game was fantastic for the first, like, 5 to 8 hours.
[145:24.62]The last, like, the middle portion of Resident Evil 7 and, like, the end were a little disappointing, but they get a free pass and the game gets, like, a solid, like... The game gets, like, a solid, like, 82 out of 100.
[145:37.63]Just because, like, the first, like, 6 hours of Resident Evil 7 was great.
[145:41.29]So...
[145:44.35]The raft part, though, doesn't even compare.
[145:49.39]Fuck the raft part.
[145:51.13]Fuck that raft.
[145:53.19]Why did it even exist?
[146:01.22]Now, obviously, Resident Evil 7 has a Capcom budget.
[146:07.34]This Outlast is not made by a major studio.
[146:12.44]And for what it is...
[146:20.67]Okay.
[146:22.33]This game's $30, but, like, let me, like, hold on.
[146:25.21]I need to, like, I need to backtrack my statements here a little bit, because this game is $30.
[146:28.49]This is not, like, a $60 game.
[146:32.79]This is $30.
[146:34.61]So... It... This is good.
[146:41.87]It's $30.
[146:44.33]Not a full-price game.
[146:45.17]Fucking half-price game, actually.
[146:47.62]Price point, I think, is good.
[146:50.34]It's a good price point.
[146:59.06]I don't know what that is.
[147:07.22]Reload.
[147:11.42]Ukuleles.
[147:12.34]This is definitely... I'm having more fun in this game than I was in Ukulele.
[147:16.15]That is definitely for sure.
[147:21.98]I don't know, I think I specifically, in quotes, said, fuck Outlast 2.
[147:25.08]But, like, you remember, that's... Like, sometimes you just get angry and you say things that you don't necessarily mean.
[147:38.96]What the fuck is that noise?
[147:39.78]I feel like I should be hiding right now.
[147:45.70]But I'm not.
[147:47.08]I don't know why.
[148:00.47]This is gonna be like the new enemy.
[148:01.53]It's gonna be like the butcher or something, right?
[148:05.85]I gotta stop hitting these hooks.
[148:07.77]They'll be able to smell me.
[148:20.40]He was just over here.
[148:27.10]Shit in my mouth.
[148:41.31]I don't even know if I was supposed to do that.
[148:42.41]I'm hiding.
[149:04.57]See, this is fucking scary.
[149:11.37]Where am I?
[149:12.73]What did I just do?
[149:13.31]Wait, wasn't I already in here?
[149:17.51]I'm like getting confused now.
[149:22.83]Yeah, I was already in here.
[149:30.02]Fuck.
[149:32.32]What was I supposed to do up here?
[149:35.06]I went backwards.
[149:35.84]Fucking god damn it.
[149:44.74]I must have missed a door or something.
[149:46.20]I don't know.
[149:58.61]What was I fucking supposed to do over here?
[150:04.64]I'm gonna like run into him or something, but like honestly like what what am I doing?
[150:13.33]I guess there's a door?
[150:16.73]Close that door.
[150:38.87]I know it's gonna happen.
[150:42.55]I know, you don't put a dangling thing like this in the last- I KNEW IT!
[150:46.17]I told you!
[150:46.85]We tried!
[150:49.67]We tried to get her back!
[150:51.79]Before the enemy cracks her wound!
[150:54.75]But they- Wait, Lin?
[150:56.87]Have you seen her?
[150:57.35]They killed us!
[150:59.62]The lucky ones they killed!
[151:02.24]Get out!
[151:03.84]We have to leave!
[151:05.60]We have to go!
[151:12.51]Alright, well, have fun.
[151:13.23]I ain't leaving yet until I find out the secrets of the fucking scary mansion.
[151:16.21]Is there anything else in here?
[151:29.40]Apparently not.
[151:31.26]There's nothing else here?
[151:32.46]Alright, here we go.
[151:35.86]Is there any more batteries?
[151:47.87]I mean, like, like, this whole school thing... Just take, it just like takes you out of what you're doing.
[151:55.80]It's... That was like really interesting and scary and cool.
[152:03.28]Like, where's the butcher?
[152:04.08]No, you're back in the school.
[152:05.70]Just walk around and then walk around again and then listen to... Here comes more, more like scary noises and blood and shit.
[152:19.30]Like that was really fucking actually starting to scare me.
[152:21.62]That was interesting.
[152:25.06]And now we're back in the office.
[152:27.16]This is like the issue that I'm... This is what I'm talking about.
[152:29.11]This is the issue I have with fucking Outlast 2.
[152:30.81]I mean, is it cool?
[152:36.19]Sure, but I feel like I'm just getting taken out of like the scary thing I was just doing.
[152:48.09]It was almost as if the game knew.
[152:49.43]Did it go on the computer or something?
[152:50.90]Or what?
[152:51.58]Bandages?
[152:52.10]I don't... Battery?
[152:57.22]Anything?
[152:58.26]Is that a battery?
[153:01.38]No, it's a pencil sharpener.
[153:05.13]Whatever, let's go.
[153:10.17]I mean, can I... How the fuck do I get out of here?
[153:20.37]I didn't even see this door.
[153:27.11]School is for you to restock.
[153:32.14]I mean, I get... Look, here's what's gonna happen.
[153:33.96]I know... I know it's gonna be like... There's a reason for all this, and this is part of the big story, and the giant story, and...
[153:45.08]There was all kinds of other things I know you didn't know.
[153:47.29]Big twist at the end, right?
[153:48.65]Like, there's gonna be a big twist at the end.
[153:52.21]But at the end of the day, I think I would much rather have, like, just a scary... escape the scary cult than let's have, like, a meta storyline that touches on a bunch of different topics and...
[154:06.96]And, like, transition to the school office building.
[154:10.73]Like, literally, I think we've done one of these transitions at least, like, ten times.
[154:21.72]Whatever.
[154:24.16]Whatever.
[154:33.02]It's like there's two scary games here.
[154:40.88]I'm the worst critic.
[154:42.04]Hey, everyone gets to have their own opinions.
[154:44.98]Just because I don't like transitioning to an office and walking around fucking ten times in the middle of my scary game.
[154:51.47]That's just an opinion.
[154:55.17]You can have an opinion too if you like walking around an office building.
[155:00.57]And there you go.
[155:01.57]We have differing opinions.
[155:13.12]But you don't like the outdoor parts either.
[155:18.40]That's not necessarily true though.
[155:25.61]Some of the outdoor parts were fucking fantastic.
[155:49.46]Oh, look out.
[155:50.50]Ah, look.
[155:53.99]Somebody left their computer on.
[156:21.74]Knew it too.
[156:23.20]Alright, so what was up with that, Jessica?
[156:25.47]That was a little weird, don't you think, Jessica?
[156:36.73]I was ready for it too.
[156:38.01]Any other computers turned on that I need to investigate?
[156:42.43]Is there like a new door that's open?
[156:48.77]Watch me have to like wheel this projector out, I would laugh.
[157:26.23]Blake against the machine.
[157:40.54]Oh, I got like a virus.
[157:49.56]Somebody really needs to get that IT guy on the phone.
[158:01.10]Let's see what he says.
[158:11.10]Nothing.
[158:11.36]Do I just have to turn on more computers?
[158:13.06]Alright, which computer is not flashing?
[158:18.04]I think I already did that one, right?
[158:19.22]This is just a really hard game of Simon Says.
[158:39.48]They downloaded it.
[158:40.58]What about this computer?
[158:49.99]I'm running out of battery, too.
[158:56.85]Like, okay, can I... I'm kind of sick of chatting with Jessica.
[159:14.25]Which one of these computers is on?
[159:18.53]Germa confirmed blind.
[159:19.57]No, Germa confirmed annoyed.
[159:22.23]And it's hard to pay attention to things when you're annoyed.
[159:25.37]And I see a flickering.
[159:26.45]It's the light right here.
[159:27.47]Why did this open?
[159:35.22]Battery life on this camera sucks.
[159:37.42]It really does.
[159:44.71]Back at the pool.
[159:47.62]Interesting.
[159:57.83]Anything in here?
[160:01.39]Projector?
[160:01.83]Do I need any projector thing?
[160:06.01]Leave a bad review?
[160:07.09]No, I don't need to leave a bad review.
[160:10.48]Hold my beer.
[160:17.14]I mean, it's not bad.
[160:19.18]This is not a bad game.
[160:22.26]It's a terrible game.
[160:28.38]I'm sorry.
[160:29.42]I don't actually mean that.
[160:30.96]I don't actually mean that.
[160:32.06]I'm sorry.
[160:34.36]That was uncalled for.
[160:35.30]Oh, hey, it's little Susie.
[160:39.59]Come here, Susie.
[160:40.43]Hey!
[160:50.84]And then I'm gonna... Oh!
[160:53.88]Come on!
[160:55.08]No!
[160:56.08]No!
[160:56.44]Why was he right there?
[160:57.76]I don't want to do this again.
[161:02.55]No, please don't put me in the beginning.
[161:03.93]I don't want to chat with Jessica anymore.
[161:06.13]I don't want to do any chat program.
[161:11.46]Damn it.
[161:11.92]Come on.
[161:30.93]Stream's over.
[161:31.53]No, we're completing this game tonight.
[161:33.39]I don't care how long it takes.
[161:40.39]Alright, where's scary martial arts guy?
[161:49.96]Is he, like, gone or what?
[161:51.08]Do I, like, hide?
[161:51.76]I don't know.
[161:52.26]Where is he?
[161:54.74]Shit, this is, like, locked.
[161:58.94]Come on, like, come up here.
[162:10.64]Stupid school.
[162:12.92]Stupid school part, man.
[162:28.03]I guess I have to go this way.
[162:41.98]And now you wake up in another dimension, back and playing the other game.
[162:46.78]Outlast 2.
[162:47.26]The reason why it's called Outlast 2 is because there's two games.
[162:54.31]Where the fuck am I right now?
[162:56.95]Like... Come up for air, like...
[163:12.24]Am I missing something or why can I not come up for air?
[163:19.03]I'm gonna die because there's no fucking place for me.
[163:27.53]I'm dead I'll be right back.
[163:34.25]I gotta pee again
[165:43.63]All right, I'm back.
[165:44.21]It's 6 a.m.
[165:48.63]Finish the game and stop peeing.
[165:49.71]What do you mean?
[166:02.89]Is that still playing?
[166:04.43]No, it's not.
[166:05.01]Okay.
[166:05.51]Wait, hold on.

[166:44.53]It's not a big deal.
[166:45.57]Sometimes you have a fucking toupee hair.

[166:49.85]And yesterday.
[166:53.88]What do you think?
[166:57.52]Should I just shave the whole fucking thing off?

[167:35.98]I guess?
[167:44.25]What happened?
[167:44.73]Why did this get so loud?
[167:48.49]This got like three times louder.
[167:50.33]Hold on.
[167:54.17]I just actually feel like somebody broke down the back fucking door here.
[168:00.03]Jesus.
[168:11.05]See, now the game is scary again.
[168:15.60]I'm scared now because I don't know what's in here.
[168:17.57]I know there's something in here trying to get me.
[168:45.45]Who the fuck is this guy?
[168:59.54]Oh, Christ.
[169:07.64]That's not a Bible thing.
[169:11.44]More Bible story.
[169:22.05]Not really sure what the hell I'm supposed to go at this point, but whatever.
[169:24.30]That guy got up.
[169:51.67]Batteries.

[172:46.71]And where the fuck was I supposed to go?
[172:50.78]The other window?
[172:56.10]Well, I can't get out this now.
[172:57.44]What about like this?
[172:58.17]Can I move this?
[172:59.99]I can.
[173:03.83]Go.
[173:07.93]Hmm.
[173:23.60]We weren't even out of the school for fucking five minutes.
[173:26.24]I am so angry.
[173:29.68]We weren't even out of the school for fucking five minutes.
[173:31.78]I feel like I'm watching like two different TV shows.
[173:35.97]Like we're flipping between two TV shows.
[173:39.39]It's like, this is like Bob and the school lunch and like the next, the other one is like murder party.
[173:46.19]Like we're going between two different fucking movies.
[173:59.06]Let's get in.
[174:07.68]They've been doing this a lot more frequently, too.
[174:09.92]It wasn't like this in the very beginning.
[174:13.06]I don't want to fucking do this part.
[174:16.16]I don't want to do this part.
[174:19.26]Now we're just back walking.
[174:24.29]How do I change the channel back to Murder Party?
[174:26.75]That's the movie I want to watch.
[174:29.03]I want to watch Murder Party.
[174:31.11]I don't want to watch Bob and the School Lunch.
[174:33.04]I want to watch Murder Party.
[174:50.54]It's because you're going and saying, that's fine, but there's two different things going on here.
[175:01.57]I just get taken out of the game.
[175:04.21]That's just what's happening.
[175:09.33]I mean, I guess I'm assuming we have to go towards the statue of Jesus, right?
[175:20.20]Please tell me he's gonna, like, jump after me.
[175:21.74]That would be so horrifying.
[175:24.52]Film it.
[175:25.14]Film it.
[175:25.56]No.
[175:26.10]No.
[175:28.45]Now it's Bob gets murdered by the school lunch.
[175:37.04]And then we're gonna turn the corner and Mr. Spaghetti is gonna be here and he's gonna come after us.
[175:56.33]There he is.
[175:56.71]That's the guy.
[176:03.33]Why do I feel like that's like an emote face?
[176:06.57]Who has this as their emote?
[176:08.29]Somebody does.
[176:13.08]Sick emote.
[176:13.84]Is this an emote?
[176:15.10]No.
[176:35.81]Oh my god, this is so terrifying.
[176:38.17]What are we gonna do?
[176:39.05]This is so scary.
[176:43.53]Oh boy, there's more.
[176:46.14]Somebody's behind me right now.
[176:47.90]Somebody's behind me.
[176:49.32]Is that me?
[176:49.82]No, no, that's the martial arts guy.
[177:38.90]Outsmarted.
[177:45.22]That was actually kind of creepy, because, like, where the... Where the fuck did he go?
[177:54.83]Oh, that's that.
[177:55.57]Okay.
[178:03.98]I'm really into, like, this whole bathroom thing, and I really... I don't... I don't know why I'm into this.
[178:12.82]I'm assuming something's going to happen at some point, and I'm going to see something scary.
[178:15.65]I thought that was...
[178:49.32]I know it's a fucking government conspiracy and like the priests like did some weird thing with a like controlled the students and a guy it's gonna be something weird and then you're not actually seeing the things you're seeing I'm like reliving my past right now being like in school and and like there's a mind controlling everybody that's what it is and there's but there's mr. spaghetti again okay and I've no don't go in there don't go in here either
[179:19.96]Where's Mr. Spaghetti?
[179:24.39]Where did he just go?
[179:37.46]What is fucking going on right now?
[180:07.42]I'm just going to run into him accidentally.
[180:09.26]We're in like the endless library now.
[180:10.90]God damn it.

[180:19.37]And here he is.
[180:20.45]Yeah, running around in circles.
[180:21.93]Which is the real Spaghetti Man?
[180:28.35]Hope you're having fun playing Outlast.
[180:30.85]You're in this fucking spaghetti maze.
[180:34.71]And there he is.
[180:36.49]Great.
[180:39.33]I guess I'm going to follow the dirt.
[180:41.97]Follow the dirty trail.
[180:49.29]I can't run anymore.
[180:53.67]Oh, come on.
[180:54.95]Oh, my fucking God.
[180:59.86]I'm going to run right into him.
[181:19.35]What am I supposed to do here?
[181:47.97]Now where do I go?
[182:16.58]I just got spaghetti sauced.
[182:28.77]Come here.
[182:30.21]Come here.
[182:30.73]Show me the right way.
[182:32.31]Was this the right way?
[182:32.95]I think she just showed me the right way.
[182:36.17]Nice.
[183:06.49]Alright, we just changed channels.
[183:07.86]We're back to a murder party.
[183:11.92]Where does this need to go?
[183:12.66]I have no idea where this is supposed to go.
[183:20.08]Let's get some going this way.
[183:30.68]Wait, what is... I'm missing something here.
[183:42.64]Like up there it just like it keeps throwing me off Now I'm gonna like run to this guy again Great and here he's gonna be right here, isn't he?
[184:13.76]Why are you doing this to me?
[184:14.90]There's no reason for it.
[184:20.64]Is somebody screaming?
[184:21.56]Okay.
[184:36.27]There's a guy.
[184:36.79]He's over there now.
[184:38.25]Should be good.
[184:40.81]Should be.
[184:41.21]That's the ideology.
[184:49.25]Fuck.
[184:51.63]I don't even know what I'm, what I'm, what I'm, I don't even know what I'm, what I'm, what I'm.
[184:54.75]You know what I mean?
[184:55.27]Like, what the?

[186:04.52]How the fuck am I supposed to even know what I'm even doing?
[186:10.40]I'm back up here now.
[186:11.44]I might as well just let him fucking kill me.
[186:23.79]I'd rather it be the spaghetti man.
[186:44.73]Like, is there something I can do in here?
[186:46.63]The fuck am I even supposed to be doing?
[187:19.70]What a fucking mess.
[187:24.24]I'm like locked in this part and everything is just identical.
[187:31.46]Like all I can do is like walk around like there's nowhere to go.
[187:42.05]You're about to get like a 4 out of 10 from me permanently game.
[187:49.58]This is just a frustrating fucking mess.
[187:51.44]It really is.
[187:56.04]It's a fucking mess.
[187:56.81]It's a frustrating fucking mess.
[187:58.47]It just is.
[188:04.89]Where the fuck am I?
[188:05.84]What did I just do?
[188:08.90]What the fuck just happened?
[188:30.82]I don't know where this is supposed to go, but it's supposed to go somewhere.
[188:35.28]We're just gonna wheel it out here, apparently.
[188:42.45]Where does this even go?
[188:56.13]Really?
[188:56.47]You're just sitting right here?
[189:08.60]What is this?
[189:09.38]What?
[189:11.76]Get up, please!
[189:23.08]What?
[189:23.70]Oh, come on!
[189:25.26]Come on!
[189:29.09]Fucking, what is this?
[189:29.71]This is Dorothy!
[189:30.75]Railroad Brick Road shit!
[189:32.03]Come on!
[189:34.33]Oh!
[189:35.69]Huh?
[189:44.23]Don't be back in the school.
[189:45.07]Don't be back in the school.
[189:45.75]Don't be back in the school.
[189:46.41]Don't be back in the school.
[189:47.23]Don't be back in the school.
[189:48.67]Fuck.
[189:49.19]Back in the fucking school.
[190:03.14]We just keep... We're changing channels too much.
[190:07.12]I don't want to change channels anymore.
[190:12.33]This channel... This channel sucks.
[190:24.06]We have to be close to it being over, right?
[190:26.51]I mean, like, we're flipping channels so quickly at this point that, like, there's no way this game's not over in, like, five minutes.
[190:59.15]What?
[191:16.74]Why can you open doors?
[191:18.00]You shouldn't be able to do that.
[191:28.75]I can't.
[191:30.17]Stop flashing!
[191:34.77]I'm gonna get grabbed again.
[191:35.89]I'm gonna get grabbed again.
[191:37.07]I'm supposed to do something.
[191:38.33]Oh my god.
[191:39.19]How close is one double door?
[191:53.82]It's not even worth opening and closing doors because this fucking asshole just comes right through.
[191:59.47]Next, we can't, no, we're like at the end of the fucking game, guys.
[192:02.07]Like, I'm not, it's not next right now.
[192:04.35]None of these open.
[192:05.57]I have to go in the bathroom.
[192:16.70]Okay, we're in the bathroom now.
[192:18.56]Okay, cool, now what?
[192:20.28]Like, now what?
[192:22.26]Like, I don't, what the, now what?
[192:24.98]He's gonna open this door.
[192:29.80]Is this HIM singing?
[192:37.22]Is this the spaghetti monster singing?
[192:59.36]I'm sitting here, like, reading chat.
[193:02.13]I was reading chat.
[193:02.89]I thought I had to sit there.
[193:08.45]I wasn't paying attention.
[193:09.19]I thought I just had to wait for him.
[193:10.20]I'm, like, looking over here.
[193:11.34]You see, look where my face was.
[193:30.40]What the fuck even is this guy?
[193:34.02]Should I just go for it?
[194:00.37]Oh, be careful, little mouth, what you say.
[194:04.08]Oh, be careful, little mouth, what you say.
[194:29.16]He was in the bathroom!
[194:31.21]He was in the bathroom!
[194:38.27]At least I got a checkpoint.
[194:43.01]Where's like the way to go though?
[194:46.05]Oh my god.
[194:46.85]Oh, that's fucking so funny.
[194:58.98]Oh, that's fucking perfect.
[195:00.71]Exit!
[195:06.59]This way.
[195:08.15]I think.
[195:15.37]Get me out of here.
[195:17.29]Get me out of here.
[195:19.39]Out the window.
[195:21.55]Who the fuck are you?
[195:23.05]Who is this?
[195:24.47]Oh no, it's Father Jenkins.
[195:27.15]He's the one that's hit it all.
[195:28.15]He's the bad guy.
[195:31.45]Tell no one, young one.
[195:46.84]Okay.
[195:56.63]What's in here?
[195:57.89]There's a bunch of locked doors.
[195:59.78]Can I move anything?
[196:00.68]Can I go out the window?
[196:03.84]I think we're just here for the rest of our lives.
[196:08.92]Going out the window.
[196:16.46]I can't step over desks.
[196:19.47]I'm really fucking ambidextrous.
[196:22.95]Alright, we're back.
[196:25.17]Hey, what's the last thing that happened in Murder Party?
[196:27.11]I don't remember.
[196:27.61]Alright, let's drop here.
[196:51.85]He's gonna burst through the door.
[196:54.71]Are we at the mine yet?
[196:55.63]I feel like we've been trying to go to the mine.
[196:57.73]And there's a guy.
[196:58.25]He's going to knock me out.
[197:01.04]I can jump from right here.
[197:02.14]Ready?
[197:02.58]3, 2, 1, action.
[197:03.96]Almost didn't make it.
[197:04.68]It's okay.
[197:24.03]Like, even in the game's lore, like, where the fuck am I right now?
[197:28.45]You know what I'm saying?
[197:31.29]Do I have to do, like, a... Do I have to do a zipline here?
[197:36.20]Nice.
[197:39.36]Zipline.
[198:21.47]You're gonna destroy your hands.
[198:25.76]I'm not supposed to go out here?
[198:26.52]Okay, well.
[198:53.73]I can't, like, where am I?
[198:55.61]I guess I'm going this way, ladies and gentlemen.
[199:07.44]No, don't, don't!
[199:08.90]Please!
[199:11.37]Get up!
[199:12.17]Why are you still crawling?
[199:13.07]There's no reason to just keep crawling!
[199:15.63]You could walk up.
[199:16.29]Has he ever walked up a slide before at a children's fucking park?
[199:21.73]I have.
[199:23.07]I've walked up a slide before.
[199:24.34]Okay.
[199:34.80]We're in the fucking dirty saloon.
[199:37.67]Can I open this?
[199:38.35]No.
[199:43.15]Two bandages.
[199:46.51]Can I move you?
[199:58.13]It's coming, alright.
[200:00.69]Alright, this is the end of the game.
[200:02.07]We're going to go down to the very bottom.
[200:05.39]And we're going to get...
[200:20.55]Okay.
[200:22.21]Okay, guys.
[200:29.37]This is just... This is like a Jason Statham movie.
[200:34.31]The only difference is I can't punch or kick anybody.
[200:47.73]Go!
[200:48.61]Come on!
[200:59.56]And... Skull!
[201:05.99]And... Here it comes.
[201:09.99]And... Skull!
[201:24.37]Let me see school and Show me school
[201:59.99]Xiaomi school!
[202:18.33]Xiaomi school!
[202:21.46]Xiaomi school!
[202:38.09]Bad answer.
[202:39.65]Didn't get the skull.
[202:56.05]Sometimes you get it wrong.
[202:57.18]Sometimes you get it wrong.
[203:01.66]Alright.
[203:02.72]Pick up the microphone and start just jamming.
[203:27.28]Follow them.
[203:27.70]Just follow them.
[203:28.20]I don't even care.
[203:30.18]Should I follow them?
[203:30.66]Which way?
[203:30.98]Left or right?
[203:31.34]I don't know.
[203:31.89]Right.
[203:51.64]Get off me.
[203:52.10]Get the water off.
[203:54.46]Shake the water off the lens.
[203:55.46]I can't see anything.
[204:03.03]Going down even further.
[204:05.75]Is somebody coming up the ladder right now?
[204:09.84]Is this like Dark Souls?
[204:10.70]Can I fuck this guy up?
[204:13.98]Back up!
[204:25.05]Back up!
[204:25.33]Back up!
[204:25.61]Go back up the ladder!
[204:26.31]Back up the ladder!
[204:26.91]Back up the ladder!
[204:45.61]Shit.
[204:45.87]Fuck.
[205:02.62]Okay.
[205:14.53]Something's right over there.
[205:25.63]Okay.
[205:31.29]Well, sorry about all that, man, but we gotta keep moving.
[205:38.52]It's like a little sneaky hole here.
[205:39.92]Okay.
[205:42.50]Battery at the end of this?
[205:44.22]Yeah.
[205:46.08]Sneaky little battery spot.
[205:47.26]Cool.
[205:47.56]I'm gonna get it.
[205:55.10]Were you filming this too, man?
[205:59.36]I think this guy was making a documentary like I was too.
[206:01.78]Except he died.
[206:18.87]Unlock and open.
[206:24.89]Reload this.
[206:59.88]Woody Woodpecker.
[207:00.97]SpongeBob.
[207:04.43]That was kind of like Woody Woodpecker.
[207:06.51]Or Popeye.
[207:22.32]Can this open?
[207:24.98]No.
[207:47.30]What's with the instant death in Outlast 2?
[207:50.01]Fucking what the fuck?
[207:52.03]Why do you instantly die?
[207:56.33]Honestly, you didn't instantly fucking die in the first game and this is on normal.
[208:06.22]I'm sick of the fucking instant death.
[208:13.93]I don't even like, fuck, I don't even care.
[208:15.54]Oh, yeah, I do.
[208:16.96]I do.
[208:17.50]I do.
[208:17.74]I have to do this.
[208:29.95]Dude, you would get like hit like three times or four times in Outlast 1.
[208:33.21]On normal.
[208:35.95]How come like I picked the wrong door and I instantly have to go back to the checkpoint?
[208:39.41]Like, give me a chance to run.
[208:49.59]That like scared the shit out of me.
[208:50.63]Of course it did.
[208:51.23]But like... What the fuck?
[208:54.57]I'm not gonna open any doors.
[208:56.61]I'm just gonna fucking go.
[208:57.41]I'm gonna get grabbed again.
[209:05.26]That like actually hurt my body how much that scared the shit out of me though.
[209:08.56]I ain't gonna lie.
[209:09.76]I don't even care.
[209:12.66]Don't even... And... And we're instantly dead.
[209:24.60]And you instantly die.
[209:55.52]There's a guy in here, I think.
[209:56.56]Anything in here I need?
[210:11.01]Shit!
[210:11.63]Get in here quick!
[210:12.25]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[210:20.77]Don't even open the lid!
[210:31.77]I thought he just opened the fucking lid.
[211:00.11]They're just everywhere, man.
[211:01.46]They're everywhere.
[211:05.96]They're everywhere.
[211:07.76]There's a person in both directions.
[211:19.89]I might just have to go for a fucking sprint here.
[211:21.53]I am.
[211:30.37]I just heard a swing.
[211:36.96]Oh!
[211:41.83]Which way is the right way?
[211:42.89]I don't know if I'm going the right way.
[211:47.27]I don't think this is the right way.
[211:49.43]I don't think so.
[211:50.07]I think I'm going backwards right now.
[211:54.96]What the fuck?
[211:57.44]What the fuck?
[212:25.97]Okay, I don't think anyone's here.
[212:27.06]I think I'm safe.
[212:31.36]I fucking think I'm safe.
[212:33.73]Who knows what the hell is going on here.
[213:04.14]I guess we're going over here.
[213:05.09]I don't... Oh, god damn it.
[213:13.11]God damn it.
[213:15.65]God damn it.
[213:19.73]Oh, god damn it.
[213:23.11]Oh, god damn it.
[213:24.60]I know what I have to do.
[213:25.44]God damn it.
[213:28.82]Come on, god damn it.
[213:32.02]God damn it.
[213:37.60]Come on.
[213:38.54]Damn it.
[213:42.10]Oh, god.
[213:42.76]Damn it.
[213:51.27]Okay.
[213:51.71]Damn it.
[213:57.87]Ah.
[213:59.25]Damn it.
[213:59.61]It's cool.
[214:03.11]Here comes the school.
[214:04.97]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[214:07.83]Anywhere to go?
[214:08.25]Over here?
[214:11.62]Nope.
[214:13.76]It's a chapter of Jesus Christ.
[214:15.82]Something about Jesus.
[214:17.78]Does this open?
[214:18.86]No.
[214:35.12]Uh... Enable the game genie.
[214:39.18]If I could, I would.
[214:39.98]Alright, anybody know how much time is left in the game?
[214:52.27]What do we got?
[214:54.89]How close are we?
[215:02.85]We're going for a time check.
[215:04.73]Time check.
[215:07.67]Four hours.
[215:25.68]Don't be right in my face.
[215:26.94]He's gonna be right in my face.
[215:28.24]He's gonna be right in my face!
[215:40.77]It's like skeleton thrown.
[215:41.83]Film the skeleton.
[215:57.04]Dude, they really just, like, throw a shitload of random people at you here, huh?
[216:06.21]It actually has been a while since the school transitioned.
[216:08.07]You're right.
[216:08.61]We're due for one.
[216:19.63]I know, you spoke too soon, guys.
[216:23.87]Here comes a school transition.
[216:25.57]Oh, this is the person from the beginning.
[216:40.48]This is the scary lady from the beginning, and now she's got it in mud.
[216:45.68]I welcome her, infant lord.
[217:01.22]Naked, hiding nothing.
[217:04.46]I live in this mess.
[217:07.54]I show my true face.
[217:17.53]No, she's got a- she's got a weird crown now.
[217:20.11]Everybody wants to know what the fuck you're drinking.
[217:34.12]What?
[217:40.52]I didn't think this was even-
[217:45.13]We were just like in a cutscene and all of a sudden she starts hitting me with a rock.
[217:49.59]Okay.
[217:49.87]Let me make this right.
[217:52.81]She's just hitting me with a rock.
[217:58.45]I thought she was supposed to like do something to me.
[218:00.81]I thought she was like coming after me for some reason.
[218:04.01]And like we're just picking random hallways.
[218:05.55]That's what you're doing.
[218:06.59]That's not the right random hallway.
[218:07.97]So now I have to turn around and go this way and run right into her.
[218:12.16]No, I'm like I'm gonna get crushed.
[218:21.56]What?
[218:22.08]Wait, how did I do that?
[218:24.71]I don't think I was supposed to do that.
[218:26.61]I don't think I was supposed to climb into the ceiling.
[218:45.40]I don't know.
[218:45.80]I'm just blocking myself in here.
[218:52.14]Alright, I'm locked in.
[218:52.86]Now what do I do?
[218:59.59]I think I have to leave.
[219:09.53]Those dirty fingernails.
[219:10.59]Alright, apparently I don't... Wait.
[219:15.66]She's over there.
[219:22.58]Which way is it?
[219:23.12]I don't fucking remember.
[219:26.80]This way is blocked.
[219:31.54]Damn it.
[219:38.42]You can hide by crouching underwater.
[219:39.86]Oh, you sure can.
[219:47.04]Almost.
[219:49.09]Almost.
[219:52.48]Hi, how are you?
[219:56.12]Did you?
[219:56.40]Alright, well, I have to pay attention to this.
[220:02.34]And I walked right into her.
[220:04.04]Oh, that's fucking wonderful news.
[220:07.66]Wonderful.
[220:08.26]What is this?
[220:08.87]Touch it.
[220:09.95]Turn it off.
[220:10.35]I'm gonna die.
[220:13.19]I'm just wedged in with her hair.
[220:14.27]I'm dead.
[220:25.10]What are you doing?
[220:26.32]That's my secret juice.
[220:27.20]Coffee?
[220:29.20]I don't know.
[220:29.46]What did I just do?
[220:29.92]I don't even know where I... Where did I end up?
[220:41.33]Thank God I put me back here.
[220:43.63]Hold on.
[220:43.93]I gotta put this in.
[220:45.47]It's freaking barbecue sauce.

[221:36.14]Did I make it?
[221:36.78]I don't know.
[221:37.32]I think I may.
[221:37.92]I may have.
[221:39.87]I'm covered in fucking water.
[221:40.97]Alright, don't be right in my face.
[222:01.75]What the fuck is even in here?
[222:05.32]Was there nothing actually even in here?
[222:06.96]Come on.

[222:11.10]The grate?
[222:12.64]No, I didn't want to open... I didn't want to go in the... Can I do anything with this?
[222:18.21]Like, just jump on top of it.
[222:21.67]Well, this is not where I was supposed to go, apparently.
[222:33.64]I don't understand.
[222:34.60]I must have missed something in that room.
[222:36.80]I have to pee again so bad.
[222:41.90]Turn this off.
[222:47.12]Did that do anything in here?
[222:48.00]Okay, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at here.
[223:01.97]I have to pee so bad.
[223:04.26]The pee is going to start coming out of me in a second.
[223:05.91]I'll be right back.
[223:33.68]What up, what up?

[225:43.51]That seriously hurt coming out.
[225:45.03]Alright, let's go.
[225:49.38]I just like sprinted up the stairs like I was peeing my pants.
[225:59.28]Okay, let's go.

[243:23.05]No.
[243:25.83]I only want us to be friends.

[243:29.95]Does one of you think you can make this right?
[243:32.67]Jessica?
[243:33.87]Jessica, look at me.
[243:36.13]Will you pray with me?
[243:37.67]Will you help me make this right?
[243:41.63]Why don't you go along home, Blake?
[243:43.67]Don't go.
[243:45.29]Did I interrupt something between you two?
[243:47.73]It wasn't like that.
[243:49.39]Then what did you want?
[243:51.66]You won't say?
[243:53.08]You know, shame is a gift from God.
[243:57.30]To let you know right from wrong.
[243:59.94]And what you want is very wrong.

[255:48.97]Well, that happened.
[255:56.84]That's fucking terrible.
[255:58.18]That's it folks.
[256:02.20]Holy shit.
[256:08.67]I was not expecting that.
[256:10.41]I looked over in chat.
[256:12.62]Somebody said they don't show it.
[256:16.00]Somebody, one of you fucking assholes says they don't show it.
[256:20.84]And I was like, I gotta believe this guy.
[256:22.78]This one guy in chat who I thought I could trust.
[256:26.59]This one guy in chat I thought I could trust my fucking life with.
[256:36.83]God damn.
[256:39.35]I made that so much worse.
[256:41.39]God damn it.
[257:12.26]I got you again.
[257:16.26]I thought, like, they... Oh, God.
[257:18.26]That's the child, isn't it?
[257:21.37]That's fucking a big, fat turkey guy.
[257:23.27]You're taking care of my children.
[257:28.43]But yours... I am powerless again.
[257:34.83]The child's too strong for me.
[257:41.37]This guy's gonna die, probably.
[257:47.17]God has gone silent.
[257:51.65]Since the storm.
[257:53.56]The birth.
[257:55.48]Who will he have if he destroys us all?
[258:01.42]Who will he have left to punish?
[258:06.17]Kill my children.
[258:08.25]All of them.
[258:08.97]Every last one.
[258:11.73]I'm sorry.
[258:16.21]I'm still getting over it.

[263:32.53]So, everybody head over to r slash Outlast 2 and figure out what the fuck just happened in this game.
[263:57.93]Uh, anyways, um, but what I was going to say is like when, when shit like hits the fan on stream sometimes, which shit hits the head, that shit hit the fan.
[264:05.80]I was not like expecting that at all.
[264:07.20]And it was, I had the way that I, when I'm on camera, like when I'm like, you can see my face and you can see every reaction.
[264:14.32]Like I, sometimes I fucking, I can't even, I can't even deal.
[264:17.38]You know what I mean?
[264:18.05]Like, cause I just like, it's fucking, I don't even know.
[264:21.05]But anyways, that was a wild fucking ride.
[264:22.97]That's true.
[264:24.59]Um, 7.4.
[264:25.05]There you go.
[264:25.43]It went from a 0 to a 1.2.
[264:27.13]Back to a 0.
[264:27.41]Up to like a 4.
[264:27.73]Down to a 0 again.
[264:28.55]Up to like a 5.
[264:29.25]0 again.
[264:29.49]And we ended at a 7.4.
[264:30.79]Okay.
[264:44.29]Anyways, that is going to wrap it up.
[264:47.17]I've been going for about five hours tonight.
[264:49.46]Thank you so much, everybody, for sticking around.
[264:52.18]This is a longer stream than usual.
[264:53.70]Usually I go for like three or four hours sometimes, but I'm glad I finished it.
[264:59.10]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[265:00.46]Before I go, though, very important, stream.
[265:04.18]I'm going to stream Sunday night because obviously I missed the last Tuesday's stream.
[265:12.71]So we went Thursday, Friday.
[265:14.51]We're going to go Sunday night to kind of cap out the week.
[265:17.09]And then we're back again on through.
[265:20.19]I can't even talk.
[265:21.02]Words don't come out of my mouth unless I'm deliberately focusing on them.
[265:25.80]Tuesday, we're going to get back to normal.
[265:27.54]But I'll see you guys on Sunday night, 7 o'clock.
[265:30.76]Same time, same network.
[265:33.09]And, yeah.
[265:34.55]Take care, everybody.
[265:35.67]It's been a pleasure.
[265:37.35]Before I go, special thanks to Slade for the bits.
[265:41.73]Zoodies gave $11, or $12 actually, and they say, survey says, no school.
[265:48.00]Ratsim was scarier.
[265:52.25]Could have been.
[265:53.35]DubskiDude, thanks for the five bucks.
[265:55.57]Did you ever beat Undertale's true pacifist mode?
[265:57.82]It's a tearjerker.
[265:59.52]Definitely stream worthy.
[266:01.06]I did not.
[266:01.96]I played Undertale, I believe it was twice.
[266:04.60]It's a great game.
[266:06.22]I had a lot of fun in it, but I did not do like a true pacifist run.
[266:09.03]Although I do know what happens, so.
[266:12.37]Anyways, Angry Alien, thanks for the two bucks.
[266:15.11]Thanks, everybody, for subbing all the new subs.
[266:17.61]You guys rock.
[266:18.93]Like always, much love.
[266:20.99]And I'll see you guys on Sunday night.
[266:22.98]Sunday night.
[266:24.00]Take care, everybody.
[266:25.50]See you all soon.
[267:11.95]Thank you.
