[ve:60.16.100]

[00:09.12]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.44]Jerma here, and Boo.
[00:12.56]Hello.
[00:13.60]Playing some Smite.
[00:14.34]It's gonna be a live commentary.
[00:16.38]Gonna showcase Apollo.
[00:19.83]The god of music.
[00:21.85]Now don't ask me why.
[00:23.77]Apollo is the god of way more things than just, like, music.
[00:27.21]But they kind of have to put that there, because there's way too many things he could be.
[00:33.12]Let's go.
[00:34.54]Where are we going?
[00:36.58]Uh, right.
[00:36.92]Okay.
[00:38.94]Well.
[00:40.16]But, bro.
[00:41.88]Oh, come on, Cupid.
[00:42.82]Come on, bro.
[00:43.45]Don't do this to us.
[00:45.47]Do they want to go right?
[00:46.19]Uh, well, Alcon is mid.
[00:50.11]Oh.
[00:50.27]What?
[00:50.43]Are we going to have, like, a party over here?
[00:55.47]Wait, what did he say?
[00:56.85]I think he's going left.
[00:57.56]No, there we go.
[00:58.14]What the hell is he talking about?
[01:00.50]I don't even know.
[01:01.60]I think he wanted to go with this Ao Kuang.
[01:03.52]Like, I think they might be pre-made.
[01:04.89]Yeah.
[01:05.71]Or maybe not.
[01:06.31]I don't even know.
[01:08.25]I just want to get a piece of cake from the cake slug.
[01:11.43]Oh, the cake slug.
[01:14.32]Who's getting this?
[01:16.22]You take this.
[01:17.04]Okay.
[01:27.49]I hope this tornado doesn't just kill him.
[01:29.91]Alright.
[01:31.31]Thank you.
[01:31.75]Cool.
[01:32.57]Let's do it.
[01:33.98]You know the speed buff now gives you attack speed as well.
[01:39.24]Oh yeah, it does.
[01:41.04]10%.
[01:41.62]Which is why it's better for the physical guys to take it, especially for ranged, because you can just pop the minions easier.
[01:46.40]Yeah, they did that a little while ago, right?
[01:49.04]It was... Yeah, it was last month or something like that, yeah.
[01:52.40]So for those of you that have no idea who Apollo is, he's the newest god.
[01:55.72]If you're watching... Oh, watch out, Arachne.
[01:58.43]If you're watching this at... What?
[02:00.19]Jeez.
[02:02.53]What the... Okay.
[02:04.55]Arachne's scary at level one.
[02:07.63]Yeah, she is.
[02:08.44]She's aggressive.
[02:09.48]She also doesn't got a whole lot of health now, does she?
[02:13.04]She'll probably regenerate back.
[02:13.82]Does she have any potions?
[02:14.48]I don't know.
[02:15.48]Yeah, she has two health potions.
[02:17.32]So what I was saying before, Arachne just tried to smoke me.
[02:20.57]Mm-hmm.
[02:21.33]Apollo is the newest god.
[02:22.53]If you're watching this right now and like six other gods have been out by then, then I apologize, but... He's ranged.
[02:28.63]He's pretty powerful.
[02:30.59]He's got a lot of utility.
[02:31.97]I'll try and give you some speed.
[02:35.63]Should be okay.
[02:36.03]I got Creeping Cursed.
[02:39.13]Okay.
[02:42.12]Yeah, he's probably my favorite god at this point.
[02:46.38]I just love the sounds.
[02:50.90]Get out of here.
[02:51.70]This guy.
[02:54.38]These guys are super aggressive.
[02:55.88]They are very aggressive, yes.
[02:57.06]So you're probably going to take our cooldown, right?
[03:01.73]Yeah, most probably.
[03:02.83]That's our cooldown, Arachne.
[03:06.75]What the hell?
[03:07.41]Oh, crap.
[03:13.01]I'm out of mana here.
[03:17.91]Ugh.
[03:19.57]So I guess try not to stand on our minions because Hades will want to dash you and that'll sting a bit.
[03:26.92]It really will.
[03:29.10]She's going to have her pull soon.
[03:32.52]We can do one more anyway before she gets it.
[03:39.20]Should have got hand.
[03:40.42]Should have got hand at the gods.
[03:43.82]Take those away.
[03:44.60]Just look in.
[03:48.18]She's right here.
[03:48.60]She's right here.
[03:50.47]She's literally right here.
[03:51.13]I don't have my dash yet.
[03:52.11]Yeah.
[03:52.23]But Haydee's coming.
[03:54.15]We might build it.
[03:54.67]We can fight Haydee this week.
[03:55.45]No, uh, she's here, she's here, she's here.
[03:56.55]Alright.
[03:58.52]I still don't have my dash yet.
[03:59.36]I don't know why I got my fear first.
[04:01.38]That was very stupid of me.
[04:02.18]Fear me.
[04:02.74]You think Arachne's gonna come back, or?
[04:06.24]Yeah, she is.
[04:06.74]She's ahead of us.
[04:11.40]So those of you wondering, when I do... When I hit ten auto attacks, I get to shoot five that are really, really fast.
[04:19.87]Just like this.
[04:20.43]Oh boy, there she is.
[04:25.47]And I'm silenced.
[04:29.09]Nice.
[04:29.33]They're diving.
[04:31.89]No, they're diving.
[04:32.49]I'm gonna go down.
[04:33.49]No, you're good.
[04:34.71]Just kill that spider.
[04:35.45]There you go.
[04:38.78]Hades did not ult you.
[04:40.14]No, he's not five yet.
[04:41.00]Okay.
[04:41.70]Arachne's out of mana.
[04:44.30]Ooh, you going in?
[04:46.16]Careful.
[04:48.34]Oh, boy.
[04:48.92]Here he goes.
[04:51.06]No, no, no, no, no.
[04:54.02]We got Arachne.
[04:55.78]I threw an auto-attack on her.
[04:57.10]Oh, no.
[04:58.16]I tried to hit F4 and I hit F3.
[05:02.42]Is that your... Oh, you didn't get back up your ult.
[05:04.37]God damn it.
[05:05.89]Ah, never mind.
[05:06.77]One thing about this keyboard I don't like is if I hit any of the F keys, I feel like I'm pressing all of them at the same time.
[05:15.03]It's quite annoying.
[05:17.18]But yeah, I threw an auto-attack at her, and she just jumped right on top of you right when it happened.
[05:21.82]Okay.
[05:24.44]I'm not going to do it yet, though.
[05:25.90]Let me know when you want to go in, because I'll pop girdle.
[05:29.51]Girdle of Might.
[05:31.73]Stay away from the minions.
[05:33.19]Hades is a... Piece of crap.
[05:35.78]Oh, well, you're a Hades, too.
[05:36.82]Whoops.
[05:38.24]Yeah, but I'm a cool-looking Hades.
[05:39.24]He's just a chump, default-skin Hades.
[05:41.36]There's a middle.
[05:46.82]That's only Alcorn.
[05:47.46]I'm not too scared of Alcorn.
[05:49.50]Is he going in?
[05:50.02]What's he doing?
[05:51.82]Well, he's taking a lot of minion damage for this.
[05:53.02]Yeah, he sure is.
[05:53.66]And Raki's right behind.
[05:58.82]Nice job.
[06:01.39]Oh no, she knocked her out.
[06:03.43]I'll figure it out.
[06:03.92]Let's kill her, let's kill her.
[06:06.16]Yeah, she's not going to get away.
[06:12.72]She does so much damage.
[06:14.64]I had to Aegis, otherwise she was gonna kill me.
[06:18.14]I was about five mana away from smacking the ground with my three and that would've killed me.
[06:22.37]I just didn't have enough.
[06:23.89]That was unlucky.
[06:25.01]Good exchange.
[06:28.65]Hades, when he dashed, he went to just go slam on minions, but my fear was ranked up and he couldn't do it and he just took a bunch of archer damage for it and his dash was down, so might as well ult him.
[06:39.52]That's true.
[06:40.70]God, there's so many minions.
[06:47.03]So many minions.
[06:50.44]How's everyone else doing?
[06:51.78]They're doing pretty good.
[06:52.38]9 and 4.
[06:53.98]Alcoons.
[06:54.94]Hold up, Midi's 2 and 1.
[06:56.16]Left lane.
[06:57.54]Cupid's 3 now.
[06:59.17]Yep, it's looking good.
[07:00.99]I think cooldown buff is back up if you want to grab that.
[07:03.11]Hades isn't really going to... Arachne's by your side.
[07:08.21]I'll be fine.
[07:08.55]I'll dash through her.
[07:10.61]She wants to pull me out.
[07:12.14]Yeah, she missed her pull.
[07:14.08]Silly girl.
[07:16.87]At a oh Man her basic attacks do so much damage.
[07:21.53]I gotta give well.
[07:22.05]I gotta get out now boys the hell is it gone.
[07:24.55]Yeah, boy blade Void blade is next for sure She wants it molting as well yep, just hanging out shooting autos Got one
[07:43.65]Oh, God, she does so much damage.
[07:46.31]Oh, no.
[07:47.13]Oh, she webbed him.
[07:48.27]Oh.
[07:50.13]Damn, she's strong.
[07:52.14]Yeah.
[07:54.94]Son of a bitch.
[07:55.86]It's that dark, man.
[07:58.10]What is she building?
[08:00.70]A little bit of life still.
[08:01.52]She hasn't got three yet, though.
[08:03.40]Yeah.
[08:05.55]Which, I'm not really sure.
[08:07.73]I bet she's, like, over here somewhere.
[08:08.87]I can hear her, yeah.
[08:09.43]I just hear her put eggs down.
[08:10.51]Yeah.
[08:12.49]She's at Manor, actually.
[08:15.29]This is risky as hell.
[08:16.45]Yeah, this is... This is, uh... Well, here she comes.
[08:19.44]Oh, she just got it.
[08:20.24]Alright.
[08:20.98]Just get away from here.
[08:21.64]I'm gonna... Oh, damn.
[08:24.72]I'm so dead.
[08:26.92]I'm so dead.
[08:29.34]She's almost dead.
[08:30.32]My last hope.
[08:31.28]My last... No, Boo!
[08:31.82]Get off of me!
[08:33.13]No, no, no!
[08:34.97]She's one shot.
[08:37.03]Yep, she sure is.
[08:37.73]Hey, Arachne.
[08:42.21]Oh, you get... Oh, stupid bugs!
[08:45.41]They're nearly dead.
[08:45.95]They're easy to kill.
[08:46.77]Hades is coming your way, but he's really low.
[08:48.64]Yeah.
[08:49.12]Yeah, shoot him, shoot him.
[08:49.88]I think you can kill him.
[08:50.44]You think I can get him?
[08:51.48]Yeah.
[08:52.48]He can't do much damage to you.
[08:54.40]Yep.
[08:56.04]He's out of mana as well.
[08:57.20]Just shoot him.
[08:59.13]Oh, as I say that, he meditated.
[09:02.62]Did he really use it?
[09:04.00]Yeah, at least he blew his meditation.
[09:05.80]Yeah, I didn't know he was that low.
[09:08.14]I thought he was at, like, at least more than half.
[09:10.36]I don't know why he chased you.
[09:11.46]He's never going to, like, out DPS you if he's got no minions to smash.
[09:15.70]So I don't know what he was trying to do.
[09:17.50]I thought he had way more health than that.
[09:18.73]Oh, well, that's good.
[09:19.97]That's a good exchange.
[09:21.09]I'll take it.
[09:22.13]I'll take that, yeah.
[09:23.39]I don't mind dying for the killing the arachne, at least.
[09:26.87]Let alone the Hades tomb.
[09:29.99]Left lane's still doing really solid.
[09:31.33]5-0 Cupid.
[09:32.19]Oh, wow, yeah.
[09:33.03]Sri Lanka's 2-1.
[09:33.85]It's looking like a GG, but... So Apollo's ultimate for people that are like, what the hell was that?
[09:42.42]If you know Thor, Thor's ultimate is he goes in the air, and you can pick a spot to jump down, and it stuns everybody, right?
[09:49.28]Apollo's, you can just ride around in the air forever.
[09:53.53]Well, not forever.
[09:54.61]It drains, what, 50 mana per second?
[09:57.11]So you can stay up in the air for as long as your mana can hold, and then you just land right on top of everybody.
[10:03.65]It doesn't stun anyone, though.
[10:04.47]That's the thing.
[10:04.81]It does not stun anybody.
[10:06.53]I think it does a dot, right?
[10:08.53]If I'm not mistaken.
[10:11.07]What now?
[10:12.46]Apollo, his dot.
[10:15.10]Yeah, his ultimate's kind of weird.
[10:17.08]It's like taking damage, his ultimate.
[10:19.94]Oh my god, every single person is in mid.
[10:23.86]Yeah, that was really unlucky.
[10:25.16]I was about to smash everyone as I went to do it.
[10:28.22]Arachne silenced me.
[10:29.48]I couldn't.
[10:32.04]They're not in mid anymore.
[10:32.96]Yeah.
[10:39.36]Yeah, they're up on building a do-mo.
[10:40.86]So he's got a lot of magic power.
[10:42.30]He hasn't died yet either.
[10:43.42]Rackney's up by Goldfury.
[10:45.64]If she... Is she gonna attack Goldfury?
[10:47.52]I'll jump on top of her if she is.
[10:50.00]I... think I... I don't know.
[10:53.93]I think I have Spider's Hedge.
[10:55.73]I think we have wards there, I think.
[10:57.61]Yeah, I was gonna say.
[10:58.93]Oh, she's in lane.
[11:00.55]I might... Oh boy, never mind.
[11:02.55]I was gonna say, I might be able to go jump on top of her right now.
[11:06.13]I don't know.
[11:08.05]Maybe.
[11:09.76]Maybe we could.
[11:10.38]Hades ult is down.
[11:11.62]Mine's up.
[11:11.96]Okay.
[11:13.76]Yep, let's do it.
[11:14.46]Right there.
[11:15.98]Alright, I'm going in the air.
[11:22.48]Nah, I thought she was going to come backwards.
[11:23.62]Nah.
[11:31.09]Boom.
[11:31.99]Oh, she exploded.
[11:33.11]She blew up.
[11:35.31]Nice job.
[11:35.93]Nice one.
[11:38.12]Yeah, I timed my ultimate.
[11:39.48]I thought she was going to go backwards.
[11:40.98]I never landed on nobody.
[11:43.21]That's okay.
[11:43.93]At least we got them both.
[11:45.09]Yeah, she was really far up with no mana.
[11:48.51]And, like, not even half health.
[11:50.69]I don't know what she was thinking there.
[11:53.03]We could grab mana.
[11:53.65]I think it might be up.
[11:55.45]Maybe, maybe not.
[11:56.91]It's worth a check.
[11:59.37]Nah, okay.
[12:00.67]No.
[12:02.05]I don't think it'll be long.
[12:03.67]Arachne's not going to last three minutes to go.
[12:05.31]Let's just try to get the tower.
[12:10.95]Missing right.
[12:14.77]Doink!
[12:18.63]Get that little doily.
[12:22.29]Little doily.
[12:23.05]How are you doing?
[12:25.11]You're... Oh, wow, you're 6 and 2.
[12:26.75]Nice.
[12:28.33]A bunch of kills.
[12:30.03]Put a bit of hurt in the tower, but...
[12:34.50]fear that guy fear me let's just not get pulled by yeah she's looking for she's looking for a pull on me no she got me but it's okay it's okay it's okay I gotta go okay my bad oh boy I'm going down here for sure yep oh get out boo she's just so much damage I know I don't think she actually went back to spawn I think she just life drained something
[13:05.17]But, uh, yeah, let's not get pulled in.
[13:06.65]Hades will have his ult now.
[13:10.25]Arachne, I don't, I don't get her.
[13:12.15]She's... She's considered... Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki.
[13:15.87]Loki, right here.
[13:17.61]Oh, boy.
[13:18.49]Oh, my God.
[13:20.54]Oh, boy.
[13:24.44]Trying to get that hit on that Loki.
[13:27.94]Oh, one more hit.
[13:28.92]Come on.
[13:29.92]Oh, bitch, I'm gonna die from the bleed.
[13:31.54]No, you're not, no, you're not.
[13:33.54]Oh, oh, oh.
[13:34.87]I feared her while she was hitting you.
[13:36.25]That was very close.
[13:38.45]I just get back to spawn before Hades dashes out the jungle on me.
[13:42.07]That was so close.
[13:45.28]I'm lucky I had that last shot on my one.
[13:49.98]My ones would have killed her.
[13:54.50]Yeah, well, lucky Hades wasn't there as well.
[13:56.26]Like, Loki kind of just, I don't know, I thought he would have killed you, to be honest.
[14:00.06]I know, it's really, what does he, what does he build, what does he got for items?
[14:02.52]Oh, he's only level 13, that's why.
[14:03.76]He's just not, he's just been kind of underleveled all game.
[14:07.10]Yeah.
[14:07.36]Right, left lane, left lane kind of sorted him out for us.
[14:12.22]He definitely would have killed me.
[14:13.06]If he was 15 or 16, oh man, I would have died in two hits.
[14:16.96]Yeah, definitely.
[14:17.76]I was just lucky.
[14:19.00]I'm going to get physical protection for that Arachne.
[14:20.82]I don't get Arachne.
[14:21.74]She's super strong and scary.
[14:24.76]I am terrified of her, but she's considered one of the worst gods.
[14:29.88]Yeah, it's very odd.
[14:30.84]Oh, right here, right here.
[14:31.58]Freya.
[14:32.28]Freya is right here.
[14:34.21]Freya is literally right here.
[14:36.51]She's on four.
[14:37.13]She's not too much of a threat.
[14:38.17]She can still do big damage.
[14:40.58]I might go in here and try to find her.
[14:42.30]She was just literally right here.
[14:44.70]No, I'd say save it.
[14:46.32]Okay.
[14:48.18]We all gonna jump on this Loki?
[14:49.88]Is that the plan?
[14:50.72]I think we're about to show this Loki that he's in the wrong lane.
[14:53.80]Alright, here we go.
[14:56.56]You're in the wrong part of town, son.
[14:58.56]Let's see if I can time this.
[14:59.48]I was gonna say if he... Yeah, he's right here.
[15:02.14]He's in the jungle.
[15:02.94]Alright, alright.
[15:05.13]Hello!
[15:08.47]I see Frayer as well.
[15:09.47]Oh, he's over here.
[15:11.35]He's trying to... What, you don't think we can see you over here?
[15:15.03]Was he going to try and pull through?
[15:17.31]I don't know.
[15:18.16]That was weird.
[15:19.54]That was very odd.
[15:21.46]This got gold.
[15:22.14]Arachne probably just soloed that, to be honest.
[15:25.34]As long as we... I found a dragon.
[15:38.10]It was kind of unnecessary.
[15:39.98]I'm going to get out of here.
[15:40.90]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[15:41.36]Irakli's right here.
[15:42.00]Irakli's right here.
[15:42.56]She's right here.
[15:43.36]Yep, they're both right here.
[15:45.40]Run.
[15:45.64]They didn't show up sooner.
[15:48.82]Get out.
[15:49.36]Get out.
[15:49.74]Get out.
[15:50.01]Get out.
[15:50.23]Get out.
[15:50.87]I'm gone, yeah.
[15:51.41]Get out of here.
[15:52.05]Get out of here.
[15:52.85]See if I can leave.
[15:54.23]Retreat.
[15:54.63]I don't know.
[15:55.01]They might be able to get that.
[15:57.39]Oh, no.
[15:57.69]Yeah, he's screwed.
[15:59.13]He's out of manners.
[15:59.75]Oh, look at his health going down.
[16:02.80]Yeah.
[16:03.82]Just do an attack buff.
[16:07.61]Oh, of course you got that.
[16:09.93]Get him.
[16:11.73]Get him.
[16:16.33]Oh, good dragon.
[16:17.37]Right when he does his ult.
[16:18.55]Beautiful.
[16:20.17]Oh, no.
[16:21.11]Pulling her.
[16:25.89]She's not going to get away.
[16:26.79]Oh, no.
[16:32.38]Nice.
[16:32.84]No, I didn't.
[16:33.32]She's life stealing you.
[16:36.48]One more hit!
[16:37.26]One more hit!
[16:40.46]I missed so many auto-attacks!
[16:42.22]So many auto-attacks were missed right there, my goodness!
[16:46.18]Thank god I could hit my one!
[16:48.90]Seriously!
[16:49.38]That's good, I refer to how Alcon kills you.
[16:50.88]There was a Freya, she could ult you.
[16:52.54]Yeah, oh my god, you're right.
[16:53.90]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[16:55.64]Ooh, that actually makes me run faster, doesn't it?
[16:58.83]You dashed and the circle hit me, so I move faster.
[17:01.29]It's cool.
[17:02.29]Yeah.
[17:03.33]It's a good little buff.
[17:04.61]Like an Inspire.
[17:08.14]I really need a void stone, but I can't afford one yet.
[17:11.52]Let's go with some... I want some crit, and I want some spree.
[17:16.57]And I want some more coffee.
[17:18.15]I'm kind of glad the arachne's doing well, otherwise this would just be a steamroll and the game would have been over a long time ago.
[17:22.27]Yeah.
[17:22.99]At least I'm making a game of it.
[17:26.40]Because left lane just stumped.
[17:30.22]You building stacks or anything?
[17:31.78]Nope.
[17:33.18]Okay.
[17:33.74]I never do.
[17:34.98]I never do.
[17:36.74]Well, Devara's gloves is pretty amazing.
[17:40.23]I don't buy it very often.
[17:41.65]It's really cheap.
[17:42.93]I only found out the other day.
[17:43.93]The one thing I don't like about stack items is you have to get the stacks.
[17:49.29]I like the items that just give you the shit.
[17:52.08]You get it.
[17:52.94]Are you taking this?
[17:54.92]You take it.
[17:55.26]I've already got max cooldown reduction.
[17:56.32]Oh, okay.
[17:58.26]Let's go help... Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[18:00.02]I'm going up.
[18:01.62]Yep.
[18:01.82]One of them's down.
[18:04.25]Loki's dead.
[18:05.17]I'm going after Freya right now.
[18:06.03]Aiden's half health, Freya's half.
[18:07.47]Oh, my prediction was wrong.
[18:09.55]It's alright.
[18:13.01]Oh, they're so dead.
[18:14.57]They are so dead.
[18:15.77]Boom.
[18:16.35]Goodbye.
[18:17.79]Nice.
[18:19.43]Woohoo!
[18:22.72]Yeah, we can do Giant.
[18:23.34]Let's go do it now.
[18:24.48]Oh, there's Arachne.
[18:26.12]In fact, if you get Giant, I'll knock down the tower and make sure Arachne doesn't come.
[18:29.96]Yep.
[18:31.42]Sounds like a plan.
[18:33.20]Who's tanking this?
[18:35.48]I actually think they're waiting for you.
[18:36.58]No, they're not.
[18:37.84]No, we're not.
[18:38.30]We're gone.
[18:40.33]Arachne's missing now.
[18:42.43]She's next to me, actually.
[18:43.55]We should kill this before she gets here.
[18:49.05]Yeah, he's almost dead.
[18:51.01]He is almost dead.
[18:51.97]Yeah, I'm going to need help with this, Arachne.
[18:54.19]Alright, we got it.
[19:00.97]That's the one.
[19:01.43]Thank you very much.
[19:05.01]I was just kind of dueling with it, like, dancing while you were doing Giant, then you all just popped out on it.
[19:09.95]There it is.
[19:10.81]That's good.
[19:13.55]GG.
[19:14.82]GG!
[19:17.20]How'd you do?
[19:18.46]Pretty good.
[19:19.42]That's good.
[19:19.74]10 of 3.
[19:21.38]Probably wouldn't have had at least 3 or 4 of those kills if not for your ultimate, but... That's how you do it, right?
[19:26.50]That's how you do it, man.
[19:28.63]Yeah, thanks for watching, guys.
[19:30.13]That's Apollo, the god of music, the sun, rain, the stars, and every other thing in Greek and Roman mythology.
[19:36.96]What is he?
[19:37.32]He's Greek, right?
[19:39.40]Greek, yeah.
[19:40.02]I think he's called Apollo in Greek and Roman.
[19:42.01]I'm not sure.
[19:42.63]Yeah.
[19:42.77]All right, guys.
[19:44.23]Well, thanks for watching.
[19:45.05]Boo, thank you for playing.
[19:46.75]My pleasure.
[19:47.91]And see you next time.
[19:48.83]Take care, everybody.
[19:49.82]Goodbye, smite.
