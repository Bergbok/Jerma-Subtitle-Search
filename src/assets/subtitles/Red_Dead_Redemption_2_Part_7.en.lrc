[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.69]So, let's see if they can get it situated at least somewhat playable in like an hour or two.
[00:08.93]Let's go.
[00:09.18]I get it.
[00:11.64]Uh, well, I don't even need- I don't have to change the title.
[00:16.28]That title is fine.
[00:21.22]So you lied to us yesterday.
[00:22.74]Wait, what did I say yesterday?
[00:27.03]What did I say yesterday?
[00:33.62]He said, Jackbox.
[00:36.34]Yeah, but... Do you want just a random Jackbox stream for like two hours?
[00:41.60]Or do you want like a five to seven hour Jackbox stream on Friday?
[00:45.86]You know what I mean?
[00:52.57]Do it both.
[00:54.15]Well...
[01:02.82]No, we're doing it on Friday.
[01:06.06]He's a liar, right?
[01:07.12]He's like, well, wait, hold on.
[01:08.00]Didn't I say yesterday that depending on how long we were in Red Dead 2, that we would do Jackbox maybe depending on if I was in it for like an hour or two, right?
[01:18.71]Didn't I say something like that along those lines?
[01:23.71]Yes, yes, yes, I did.
[01:25.21]Yeah, yeah, yes, I did.
[01:26.63]Yeah, yes.
[01:29.17]See, it's just like online, see?
[01:38.62]Let's give him some time to try it again.
[01:40.86]Because I still haven't done all this.
[01:48.35]Where are we going here?
[01:53.59]Jackbox, jackbox.
[01:55.79]Friday will be fun.
[01:58.79]So I need to go here.
[02:00.27]So we need to take a stagecoach.
[02:04.96]From here.
[02:06.80]all the way across the world to here and then ride home.
[02:12.37]Roads.
[02:14.71]Oh, why can't today be fun?
[02:18.27]Well, because we attempted to play a beta that wasn't ready.
[02:22.19]Am I gonna make rules for people joining the game this time?
[02:29.82]Uh, you mean Jackbox?
[02:36.96]Let me actually, I might be able to set something up where it just picks people randomly.
[02:41.20]Isn't that like an extension for you that you can get that?
[02:47.21]And then like that, that person, that person gets picked again.
[02:52.03]I could do it like that.
[02:52.69]That'd be fun.
[02:55.56]Why do I hate Red Dead single player so much?
[02:57.34]Oh, no, I don't.
[02:57.96]I love this game.
[02:59.62]I think this game's fucking awesome.
[03:01.72]It's just, I mean, the multiplayer is just the new thing, and it's really, really interesting.
[03:06.87]Like, oh, wow, it's Rockstar's new online in the Wild West.
[03:09.99]Cool.
[03:10.71]I think my horse's foot just exploded.
[03:20.41]Why do you hate Jackbox?
[03:27.30]I played Fistful of Frags.
[03:30.54]I don't even have it installed.
[03:32.46]Remember, I reinstalled Windows.
[03:34.39]Remember the Windows update bullshit I was going through?
[03:36.79]Where we just would not turn it... Where is this marker?
[03:40.53]Oh, right.
[03:40.85]Stagecoach.
[03:42.95]Yeah, I had to reinstall Windows completely.
[03:51.43]So, I lost all my downloads.
[03:54.44]I tried to get as many things as I wanted before.
[04:00.74]Peggle 2 got me excited.
[04:02.10]I'm full of letdowns, guys.
[04:06.30]I'm sorry.
[04:06.72]It's only like 2 gigs.
[04:21.92]The letdown stream.
[04:23.74]No, am I though?
[04:25.43]I'm sorry.
[04:26.25]I'm sorry!
[04:35.25]I gotta get up before anybody witnesses it.
[04:37.63]Quick, get me to Rhodes Ranch before somebody witnesses me.
[04:43.08]Uh, Coachman, hello.
[04:47.90]Hello!
[04:49.52]I'd like to take a ride.
[04:50.40]Take a ride, please.
[04:58.08]Take a ride.
[05:00.10]Coachman, L2.
[05:03.34]What the fuck?
[05:04.88]Am I sure I'm not online?
[05:17.10]Who is shooting?
[05:18.08]Is it the guy that... Is it the guy that I bumped into?
[05:30.05]It's not a bounty, it's... What?
[05:34.28]Wait, did I what?
[05:34.96]What did I just do?
[05:39.64]I just like broke into his lock.
[05:45.68]Break.
[05:46.98]Oh god.
[05:51.19]Did I break his wagon?
[06:05.07]Where's my horse?
[06:06.90]Oh, for the love of God.
[06:07.88]This is going to be bad up ahead.
[06:13.44]Stop shooting.
[06:14.60]You have so many opportunities.
[06:15.90]Fuck off.
[06:33.24]No, now you decide to come.
[06:34.36]Now you decide to come over here, horse, huh?
[06:44.10]Who was the guy I bumped into?
[06:48.34]You just couldn't let it go.
[06:50.71]Now you let it go permanently.
[06:56.57]Alright.
[06:57.27]Back to the stage, coach.
[06:59.15]Before this guy sees me over here.
[07:08.42]Wait.
[07:14.77]What was that?
[07:18.39]Somebody in the water?
[07:19.31]I don't see him.
[07:32.72]There's a random stranger over here somewhere.
[07:42.03]Oh, there he is.
[07:44.03]Alright.
[07:47.91]What do you need help with, sir?
[07:52.33]Mad preacher.
[07:59.32]I'm not coping very well with life, my friend.
[08:05.34]He won't send me the message.
[08:08.67]He won't.
[08:11.85]I've been here for years, and nothing, nothing... What?
[08:21.52]Are you the signal?
[08:22.64]I don't think so.
[08:29.02]How do you know?
[08:29.96]I'm not a signal.
[08:32.34]How do I know?
[08:33.72]How do I know?
[08:46.91]Well, that was it.
[08:47.95]He's going back up here.
[08:54.31]Is there something I can do with this guy?
[08:57.20]Besides just push him off the cliff into the water, which is what I'm sure everybody wants me to do.
[09:30.79]Where is he?
[09:31.33]That didn't hurt him, okay.
[10:00.24]Alright, come with me.
[10:27.39]First circle to talk while running.
[10:29.25]Oh, whoops, no.
[10:34.46]Alright.
[10:35.26]Uh, I need to pick him up.
[10:49.39]No, I'm not going to do anything to him.
[10:50.59]I just wanted to see what he would do if I jumped on him.
[11:00.53]I'm putting him back in bed.
[11:02.01]I might have hurt him a little bit, but he's back in bed.
[11:08.34]He's going to be fine.
[11:11.22]Alright, have a nice day.
[11:15.86]He just witnessed an assault.
[11:17.04]Well, he's the guy that I... Oh, now we're doing it all over again.
[11:26.78]How do I like to feel?
[11:27.78]Nothing.
[11:28.06]Relax.
[11:28.84]Just stop.
[11:29.48]Stop.
[12:04.18]Stop it!
[12:07.96]Stop!
[12:22.87]What's the objective here?
[12:23.85]There really is none.
[12:24.53]Goodbye.
[12:25.21]Have fun.
[12:25.71]Enjoy the rest of your life.
[12:37.49]That's not how you make friends.
[12:38.53]The only way to make friends is GTA Online.
[12:41.55]And Rockstar Online.
[12:51.78]Enjoy the bounty.
[13:13.85]Alright, we're good.
[13:17.96]So I need to go... It was the fucking stagecoach.
[13:24.32]Because the guy... Look, it all started... This 15 to 20 straight minute nonsense started because I bumped... I ran into a guy in town.
[13:34.02]And it just spiraled out of control.
[13:35.52]$5 bounty.
[13:37.14]I can pay that.
[14:03.87]What's this?
[14:06.11]Why is there a red circle in there?
[14:07.21]Is that the sheriff's office?
[14:14.19]Just pay the bounty, take the stagecoach.
[14:17.04]Everybody hates me here.
[14:23.00]Let's not forget, I bumped into the guy and he started shooting wildly.
[14:26.10]I don't know whether to be impressed or frightened.
[14:34.97]Got no bounties anymore.
[14:36.17]They're all gone.
[14:38.57]Back to square one.
[14:39.77]We're good.
[14:44.17]Stagecoach is... Where exactly are you right now?
[14:48.88]I already have it marked.
[14:53.48]Why do I have so much money?
[14:54.28]Because I just did a couple missions where I made a lot of money.
[15:02.02]I'm a good boy again.
[15:04.62]Just don't bump into somebody.
[15:06.10]Don't smash into someone.
[15:09.86]Get to the stagecoach.
[15:11.94]Without any issues.
[15:15.34]Pay it.
[15:16.10]Go to Rhodes.
[15:17.18]Do the mission.
[15:19.44]Do not break the lock.
[15:22.37]Rhodes Ranch.
[15:24.11]Take me there.
[15:24.49]I'm about 45% of the way through the story.
[15:27.91]43% maybe.
[15:37.70]I'm still playing this?
[15:39.48]We've got somewhere to be.
[15:40.34]Yeah.
[15:44.64]Well, I couldn't do online because there's all kinds of problems with it.
[15:56.50]I will give it another solid attempt before I consider ending the stream, that is certain.
[16:01.29]So don't worry.
[16:03.87]And then nothing tomorrow.
[16:06.03]That'll lead us into Friday for Jack Bucks.
[16:09.47]Party Pack 5.
[16:11.73]And then into the weekend, we've got the movie night on Sunday.
[16:15.26]So... Should be fun this weekend.
[16:17.72]I'm looking forward to it a lot.
[16:25.02]Alright.
[16:27.96]Let's progress.
[16:30.95]Let's progress the story of Red Dead... Two.
[16:52.63]I can't wait to get hammered and watched this weekend.
[16:59.68]I mean, Jackbox is a lot of fun.
[17:02.72]Movie Night's going to be probably a lot of fun, too.
[17:09.29]I'm also planning on doing that.
[17:13.55]I'm not sure.
[17:14.13]I don't know if that's in my plan.
[17:15.41]We'll see.
[17:15.79]Maybe I'll have a couple of drinks during the Movie Night.
[17:20.87]That sounds fun.
[17:21.37]Where can you find my specs and my mouse?
[17:27.16]I don't even have it listed.
[17:28.52]You're right.
[17:30.44]What did I do?
[17:32.02]Is there a command still?
[17:32.94]I think there was a command at one point.
[17:37.36]Oh, there it is.
[17:37.98]Oh, yeah, there it is.
[17:38.96]Take a look at that.
[17:42.72]I've got 17 6850s.
[17:43.20]We've been learned Dutch.
[17:56.81]Yeah, I have a 6850k, a... GTX 1080 hybrid.
[17:57.55]What does that mean?
[17:59.19]Alright, I'll join Hosea.
[18:00.37]Yeah, I know I wrote that, but what does it mean?
[18:03.67]Like, I... I don't know what that means.
[18:26.21]Get some free food, that sounds good.
[18:32.17]The GTX 1080 Hybrid has an AIO water cooler.
[18:36.09]Oh.
[18:37.56]Maybe that's what it is.
[18:39.04]I don't have a TI or anything.
[18:40.76]I think this is cool too.
[18:44.15]Rob a home.
[18:45.01]Yeah, I'm doing that instead.
[18:47.13]I have a death adder.
[18:49.21]It's the only mouse I've owned in probably 10 years.
[19:03.52]Because there ain't no judgment here.
[19:05.61]Most folks hate the Negroes.
[19:07.19]They hate the Redskins.
[19:08.13]I just don't have, uh... When you get used to a mouse, you kind of can't ever use anything else.
[19:12.85]I hate everyone just the same.
[19:14.71]Well, in that case, you're gonna want what I just found for us.
[19:19.02]What's that?
[19:20.06]I was riding around a couple of days back.
[19:22.20]I come across this old cabin.
[19:23.38]A couple of fuckers lazing about outside all liquored up.
[19:27.10]I didn't think nothing of it.
[19:28.89]Then I come across this hunter down by the river.
[19:31.93]He tells me they're a stick-up crew.
[19:34.37]Says they hit a train a couple of days back near Emerald Ranch.
[19:38.07]Nice fella he was.
[19:38.99]Shared a bottle we did.
[19:40.09]Then I robbed the bastard blind.
[19:42.23]You believed him?
[19:43.17]No reason not to.
[19:44.35]If he's right, it'll be a big haul for us.
[19:46.69]Hey, gamers.
[19:47.73]Maybe more, but I reckon you and me, we could take them real easy.
[19:52.54]Alright.
[19:53.92]What the hell?
[19:55.10]Let's go check it out.
[19:57.26]These missions are a lot of fun, because you actually make a shitload of money doing them.
[20:10.35]Not that I need money, but it'd be nice to have it and never have to worry about it.
[20:16.33]Follow behind Sean.
[20:18.99]Oh, your horse's name's Sean too!
[20:20.35]That's kinda cool.
[20:31.58]It's a bit of a ride.
[20:35.63]Oh, we got time.
[20:39.91]That is my horse.
[20:41.09]Oh, well.
[20:42.94]Cool.
[20:49.64]I miss Sean.
[20:51.02]Me too.
[20:51.54]I want to just go dunk on people in multiplayer.
[21:12.94]you mean get dunked on in monkey no uh what should we be talking to come on man what were you doing riding around up there anyway
[21:24.11]sniffing around, looking for a take.
[21:26.55]I got a long nose for these things.
[21:28.54]Dutch has always honored us to get out there and bring in money, ain't he?
[21:32.16]And rightly so.
[21:33.86]I ain't like some of them others back there, sitting around waiting to be told, I go after it.
[21:39.30]I see you sitting around planning.
[21:41.68]I mean, I don't need no coddling like the rest.
[21:44.90]Dutch know
[21:45.42]Have I played the multiplayer yet?
[21:46.54]Yeah.
[21:47.30]We tried it for a few hours earlier.
[21:49.10]It did not work.
[21:49.77]Well, it half worked.
[21:50.61]I'm getting Rockstar server problems.
[22:01.43]Probably every 30 minutes or so, every 20 minutes.
[22:04.73]And then it upped in frequency, and it started happening every, like, five minutes.
[22:09.97]So, we decided we were gonna take a break from it for like an hour or two, do a couple story missions, play this for a little bit, and then try it again.
[22:17.80]See if it gets any better in a couple hours.
[22:20.28]What's that box boy's tent for, then?
[22:23.34]Camp funds, supplies, and the like.
[22:27.57]The fact you don't know that suggests you clearly ain't put much in it.
[22:31.64]Why, you always pay me way, don't you, Woody?
[22:34.89]How long am I going to stream?
[22:37.63]Um... I don't know.
[22:38.35]Probably for at least another few hours.
[22:42.38]Another four hours or so, probably.
[22:43.80]I would assume.
[22:44.68]Quick, make a joke.
[22:46.56]Um, um, um.
[23:04.87]Knocked out in Blackwater too, didn't you?
[23:08.42]No, that was bloody chaos.
[23:10.74]Did you get split off with Mac?
[23:13.78]A guy, a guy, and a guy walk into a bar.
[23:16.30]The guy behind the counter says, what are you guys doing here?
[23:18.98]Guy number one says, my wife's going to be angry.
[23:21.52]Guy number two says, so is mine.
[23:22.64]Guy number three.
[23:23.22]That's weird.
[23:23.70]Okay.
[23:23.88]I was getting a text.
[23:50.78]I do have... Ooh!
[23:53.02]I know what it is!
[23:54.12]I know what it is.
[23:57.31]I got a coffee table!
[23:59.99]My coffee table's coming in.
[24:01.33]Yes!
[24:01.41]Yes!
[24:01.69]That was a terrible punchline.
[24:04.13]Oh, that's right.
[24:04.49]I was telling a joke.
[24:20.14]Guy number three.
[24:24.10]Something about a ferris wheel.
[24:28.32]He was eating and I think he dropped it.
[24:30.70]I forget what happened after that though.
[24:34.80]Look, there's one of them outside.
[24:36.82]This is good.
[24:38.64]It is?
[24:39.68]Leave it to me.
[24:40.98]I'll do the talking.
[24:42.20]You hang back.
[24:52.25]Slowly, slowly.
[24:57.95]I did find the aliens.
[24:59.03]I did.
[24:59.94]That was a long time ago.
[25:04.18]Weirdly enough, I found that, I think, in the first six hours of me playing the game.
[25:11.52]I'm gonna give you and your daddy about five seconds to get the hell off my property, boy.
[25:16.77]Look, we don't want no trouble.
[25:19.17]We just thought you might like to know we passed a big posse of lawmen headed this way.
[25:23.17]There were a dozen of them coming up east.
[25:25.65]What?
[25:26.91]Where?
[25:28.56]Right here.
[25:29.96]Heads up, Arthur.
[25:31.30]Here come the rest of them.
[25:36.68]Watch it!
[25:47.99]Oh my god, what?
[25:53.41]Fuck no!
[25:55.11]No!
[25:55.25]Can I wake him up?
[26:24.05]I was stuck in the doorway and I pressed R2.
[26:28.23]Look, I'm gonna put the fire out and then pull the lever underneath.
[26:31.20]Don't worry, I got it.
[26:31.92]Oh look, a stash box.
[26:43.55]Oh, well, the game found it for me.
[26:45.13]Thank you, game.
[26:45.69]I really appreciate the help.
[26:49.94]Who's that?
[26:52.04]Double action revolver.
[26:56.20]That's kind of cool.
[26:56.88]I'm not leaving yet.
[26:59.36]Hold on.
[27:05.19]Wait a minute.
[27:08.37]No, that's my skull field, though.
[27:17.98]What's better when this is clean?
[27:19.91]Hold on.
[27:28.01]Does the skull feel better?
[27:28.79]Um, I mean, kind of.
[27:36.82]Accuracy, it's much more accurate.
[27:39.66]Fire rate's lower, but no, I think this thing sucks.
[27:45.88]Because I have two skull fields.
[27:48.22]And they are beautiful.
[27:50.74]Alright.
[27:55.10]Anything else?
[28:00.85]This guy died, I guess.
[28:03.13]Is he dead?
[28:04.01]He wasn't dead when I looked at him before.
[28:07.69]No, he's alive, see?
[28:12.22]Take the meats.
[28:20.03]Not at all.
[28:22.28]Search the cabinets.
[28:28.14]Free gin, I'll take it.
[28:49.08]Where was the money?
[28:51.97]Where's the money?
[28:56.36]I know it's a secret little spot.
[28:59.26]Oh, there's money right here.
[29:03.50]15 bucks, pretty good.
[29:08.55]Piss in the fire.
[29:11.43]You can't pee in this game, so I'm sorry.
[29:24.25]Can I not get the secret?
[29:26.67]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[29:28.41]Oh, that's wrong.
[29:32.81]Maybe they have to tell you where it is.
[29:33.97]I don't think I can get it.
[29:46.98]No prompts, no nothing.
[30:07.83]Read chat?
[30:08.87]It's in the wall behind the bed.
[30:10.43]I just was there!
[30:15.41]The wall behind the bed.
[30:16.47]Wasn't I just over here?
[30:17.29]I don't think I can get it without his prompt.
[30:26.26]Yeah, you can't unless the NPC tells you.
[30:27.98]See?
[30:28.20]I've... You can call me stupid for hitting the guy in the face with the barrel earlier.
[30:32.44]That's cool, girl.
[30:44.93]He doesn't know the piss code.
[30:56.22]You can't get it without him telling you.
[30:58.88]Yeah, that would make sense.
[31:01.36]Otherwise you could just stay there all day and just walk around and find it.
[31:03.71]Alright, Jose, what do you need?
[31:13.77]This is not Hosea.
[31:15.75]Not at all, actually.
[31:23.10]Holy shit!
[31:25.24]Come on, I gotta get the head exploding achievement!
[31:45.66]Oh, ta-dang!
[31:55.17]Trophy earned.
[31:57.79]100 heads exploded with shotgun.
[32:02.82]So, we've got probably some cool stuff here.
[32:10.98]These are bad guys, so it's okay.
[32:12.28]I mean, yeah.
[32:21.37]Looking for a lockbox.
[32:22.63]That's a lockbox.
[32:27.00]If I was a lockbox, I'd be this one.
[32:28.62]Medical box, actually.
[32:35.54]Miracle cure.
[32:36.44]I can't take any more of it.
[32:39.04]Opened miracle tonic.
[32:40.04]I might as well just use one, right?
[32:44.00]Where's the miracle?
[32:44.52]Alright, potent miracle tonic.
[32:46.62]Opened miracle tonic.
[32:47.56]Just take it and pick up the other one.
[33:00.07]Okay, I think that's it.
[33:01.95]That's the most important thing, at least.
[33:03.21]Oh, no, this... Can I open this, too?
[33:07.91]Yeah.
[33:09.49]Yeah!
[33:11.94]Hay.
[33:14.06]That's all you have in there is hay.
[33:18.34]Uh, assorted biscuits.
[33:19.64]Feeded the horse.
[33:24.63]Corn.
[33:25.17]This is just stocking me up on food.
[33:31.47]If you piss in the fire, it gives you a code for unlimited lives.
[33:34.96]Well, I don't want it anyways.
[33:39.30]Who wants unlimited lives right now?
[33:45.78]Something on the ground?
[33:47.05]I'll check one more time.
[33:53.33]Ah.
[33:55.45]Hello there.
[33:57.33]Don't mind if I do.
[33:58.21]Who wants to live forever?
[34:02.60]No, why would you want to live forever?
[34:07.93]Okay, instead of living forever, could I choose a different option?
[34:14.75]Could I just, you know, once I'm gone, can I, like, unlock an ability?
[34:19.17]Instead of, oh, I want to be alive, live forever.
[34:21.47]No, just every, like, 100 years.
[34:23.71]No, no, probably 30 years.
[34:25.19]Every 30 years, I just want to turn into, like, a spirit.
[34:28.25]And just kind of see what's going on.
[34:29.31]Just, like, walk around and look at stuff.
[34:31.56]You know, every 30 years.
[34:32.97]Just... Oh, here we go.
[34:34.33]Okay, so what's going on now?
[34:41.97]What's the world like now?
[34:48.10]You can do that now, just be a hermit.
[34:49.36]Yeah, but you can only do that for, like, two times.
[34:52.45]You can go live in a cave and eat dirt and, like, pee in a cup and drink it and, like, eat rabbits and stuff.
[34:57.69]And then come out in 30 years and look around and be like, holy shit!
[35:01.05]But you can only do that, like, twice.
[35:02.83]I'm talking literally forever.
[35:06.94]What if the world is destroyed?
[35:08.04]Then you can just turn it off.
[35:13.19]You can just, after you wake up for that time, and it's like, well, this is, the world is just a smoldering crater right now.
[35:18.49]Oh.
[35:19.55]Okay, like, um, I would not like to do this again.
[35:22.97]But I would want to do it at least... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[35:27.01]No, that's not a good idea.
[35:27.85]That'd be awesome.
[35:28.64]Because if you kept doing that, imagine, like, what would happen.
[35:32.52]Like, we're talking about an entirely new, like, species.
[35:37.50]If you woke up every 30 years and the world was just abandoned, like in 5 million years, there's probably gonna be like a weird fucking new creature that takes over the whole planet.
[35:49.64]We're talking about living forever versus waking up every 50 years just to kind of see what's going on.
[36:06.45]Every hundred years, yeah.
[36:07.87]That'd be better.
[36:11.61]Imagine waiting five million years for bacteria.
[36:18.16]Yeah, and then you could just observe forever.
[36:21.58]You and Dutch was just doing your duty when you requisitioned it.
[36:25.77]waking up every hundred years, and you get fast travel, and you get 30 minutes.
[36:31.75]Right?
[36:32.19]Like, spend 10 minutes in, like, Rome?
[36:34.93]What's going on here?
[36:36.73]Well, that's interesting.
[36:37.87]Spend 20 minutes in fucking Boston?
[36:39.17]What's Boston like?
[36:50.64]So what exactly are we doing?
[36:53.30]This is the moonshine we took after going up the breakaway still, right?
[36:58.16]I think that goods citizens taking the trouble to return their stolen goods deserve some reward, don't you think?
[37:03.70]Well, then it's time we made a formal introduction.
[37:06.80]That's what you want?
[37:07.56]You don't just want to know?
[37:09.58]These are two big old plantation houses.
[37:12.38]All I keep hearing is they hate each other so much they can't see past it.
[37:16.60]I know.
[37:16.92]I've seen it.
[37:19.06]There's a gray boy and a Braithwaite girl carrying on a secret affair.
[37:24.50]I've been, well... What are you doing?
[37:27.32]Use the reins, damn it!
[37:30.58]The mind boggles.
[37:32.76]You think they're... Just street sweep to that guy.
[37:35.55]They don't seem too involved in the rest of it, but maybe.
[37:39.55]Well, I'm sure there's money in this for us somewhere if we can get in the middle of it.
[37:44.21]Is the type of jellyfish that's immortal?
[37:47.15]Hold on, this is... This is beautiful.
[37:49.09]This is actually beautiful.
[37:54.95]Where on the map even are we?
[37:56.21]This is such a weird road.
[37:57.67]Do I not have, uh...
[38:27.47]Did I get him?
[38:28.21]Why is this guy invincible?
[38:39.06]Okay.
[38:39.70]Where's my scope?
[38:48.74]I have like a rifle, don't I?
[39:05.67]The horse just got in.
[39:06.58]Hey, that horse got in without being checked.
[39:09.34]That's not fair.
[39:11.68]Hello, gentlemen.
[39:12.88]How are you?
[39:14.22]What's that in the back there?
[39:16.10]Moonshine, my fine fellow.
[39:18.60]May I have a word with the man of the house?
[39:21.21]The man of the house is a lady.
[39:23.95]Mrs. Catherine Braithwaite.
[39:25.73]May I speak with her?
[39:27.39]I want to discuss a business opportunity.
[39:30.07]I mean no harm.
[39:31.83]No harm at all.
[39:38.00]Single-player griefer.
[39:41.32]Oh, don't sit on the back of that, man.
[39:43.15]Please don't sit on the back of that.
[39:44.49]No, I'm just... It is so tempting, though.
[39:46.41]You're right, it really is.
[40:01.76]Just to drive him off the cliff and just ghost ride him.
[40:12.48]What you want?
[40:13.89]Found something.
[40:15.45]Out in the hills, thought.
[40:17.30]Thought maybe you was in the market for it.
[40:19.50]For what?
[40:20.42]Some liquor.
[40:21.00]I ain't in the market for what's already mine.
[40:23.41]The way we see it, it's ours.
[40:25.79]Well, with us possessing it, and I checked all over, for the life of me, I couldn't see your name on it.
[40:31.53]Uh-oh.
[40:33.41]Here comes the whole family.
[40:36.13]Oh, it seems that's easy enough.
[40:37.72]Want to do a deal?
[40:40.02]What do you sell that stuff for?
[40:41.86]Really?
[40:42.22]Hosea, quite the negotiator.
[41:07.23]Pleasure doing business with you.
[41:09.19]And listen, we didn't take it, at least not without orders.
[41:14.06]Oh, I know exactly who gave you your orders.
[41:16.94]Old Sheriff Gray.
[41:19.32]You know what?
[41:20.54]I don't want it.
[41:21.62]In fact, sir, now you can do me a favor.
[41:25.08]There's an extra ten bucks if you do.
[41:27.24]Audio's messed up again.
[41:27.76]Drop the stuff into Rhodes, head over to the tavern run by Mr. Gray, and give the stuff out for free.
[41:33.86]Mama!
[41:34.46]Hush now.
[41:35.87]I believe they call that a promotional expense.
[41:40.09]They do.
[41:40.53]As you wish, madam.
[41:41.63]As you wish, they do.
[41:42.49]That's true.
[41:43.17]Come on, Arthur.
[41:44.17]Let's take it out of here.
[41:46.23]Alright.
[41:46.97]Next stop, the Rogue Saloon.
[41:47.90]Here we go.
[42:01.58]Take the moonshine to Rhodes Saloon.
[42:03.20]Going to play Fibbage?
[42:05.13]What is in that fifth party pack?
[42:07.67]I don't know what's in it.
[42:08.75]I've seen a couple of random clips of what's in it, but I don't know every single game.
[42:13.83]We'll find out on Friday.
[42:32.76]Alright.
[42:34.16]This could get ugly.
[42:36.02]You and Dutch already have that thing going on in town with the sheriff.
[42:40.69]Yeah, Mr. Gray.
[42:41.73]That's it.
[42:43.05]Now we're inserting ourselves in his blood feud.
[42:50.26]We'll need something.
[42:51.76]I ain't playing dressing room.
[42:55.08]She gave you three hundred dollars to do this.
[42:58.03]Three hundred bucks is a lot of money.
[42:59.79]Back in like the forties here.
[43:03.29]Why would you do that?
[43:21.13]Smoke this pipe.
[43:22.15]The 40s?
[43:23.64]Yeah.
[43:24.46]Bring your lip forward.
[43:25.36]Yeah, somebody got like the 1740s, like the 1640s.
[43:28.72]Perfect.
[43:29.84]What about you?
[43:31.04]What did you think I meant?
[43:33.06]You can't speak.
[43:35.18]19?
[43:39.32]Yowzers, you know what else people say?
[43:41.04]Yowzers.
[43:42.88]There, there.
[43:44.38]Don't get mad now.
[43:55.35]That was rough.
[43:57.27]That was a little rocky.
[44:16.83]Why don't they make a GTA or a Red Dead type game in caveman times?
[44:30.02]Grand Theft Dinosaur.
[44:39.15]Rockstar making a medieval Europe game?
[44:46.43]I'm sure it would be amazing, but... You know, they can only do so many things.
[44:53.34]Although, I can't say I'm too sure how well they would handle melee combat.
[44:59.55]Hey.
[45:00.59]Hello.
[45:02.24]Hello, I'm Melvin.
[45:04.51]This is my brother Fenton.
[45:06.20]Don't mind him.
[45:06.84]Don't madden him.
[45:08.02]He turned idiot.
[45:09.74]Killed our mother, but it weren't his fault.
[45:11.50]How'd you boys like a couple of bucks?
[45:15.14]I bet you would.
[45:16.34]I love Jose.
[45:17.10]Jose is awesome.
[45:18.02]We're in the new trade of advertising, which is an American art form about insuring people by the correct things.
[45:25.39]I don't know.
[45:26.51]One more dollar.
[45:28.37]Says give us half an hour.
[45:29.73]What harm can we do in half an hour?
[45:32.07]Go along now.
[45:33.98]Enjoy the money!
[45:36.48]Come along, Fenton.
[45:38.74]Let's hand out the liquor.
[45:40.88]Go behind the bar.
[45:42.58]And this alone.
[45:43.24]Cool.
[45:46.15]Combat is fine in Rockstar games.
[45:48.89]With an S. With an S on it!
[45:50.43]Gentlemen!
[45:55.66]Gentlemen!
[45:57.46]My name is Melvin.
[45:59.20]That's my brother, Fenton.
[46:00.52]He's a bit funny, but boy, can he pour drinks fast.
[46:04.71]For the next 30 minutes, the drinks in this here bar, in this here town, are entirely free.
[46:12.29]The only reason you gotta drink them, so hurry up, put old Fenton to work.
[46:16.74]Oh, fine, I'll drink as fast as I can.
[46:19.50]Mama made him mad, and we buried her.
[46:21.90]Ha, ha, ha.
[46:25.53]Oh, raise the bottle.
[46:26.69]Let's go.
[46:27.81]Pour it.
[46:28.15]Alright, take it.
[46:29.03]Oh, shit.
[46:29.50]Wait, wait, wait.
[46:30.44]Pour the bottle.
[46:31.22]How do I serve it?
[46:33.76]Here, take this one, too.
[47:00.14]Playing the idiot role well.
[47:01.84]Hey, how about a drink with me, boys?
[47:03.78]Trying to put a pillow on the glass.
[47:06.80]Okay.
[47:07.74]So, my boy Fenton can sure pour drinks fast.
[47:10.21]Too fast, one would say.
[47:41.71]I still have the same pipe in my mouth.
[47:50.21]Are you sure this is alcohol and not, like, fucking, like, Molly?
[47:54.10]Like, what the hell am I serving these people?
[47:55.36]Like, ecstasy?
[47:56.08]Good evening, gentlemen.
[48:06.60]Uh-oh.
[48:07.10]Yeah, but it is moonshine, that's right.
[48:10.20]And just like that, we had one.
[48:11.60]Wait, what can I not?
[48:34.69]More coming in.
[48:40.94]Up top.
[48:44.22]Arthur, help!
[48:44.80]Uh-oh.
[48:45.24]I don't know how to pour drinks.
[48:48.94]I don't know how to do anything else.
[48:51.23]Hosea, Hosea, Hosea, Hosea, Hosea!
[49:05.53]What the fuck?
[49:11.44]Got him.
[49:17.05]There we go.
[49:20.05]Stairs.
[49:34.81]I can't move.
[49:35.67]I can't move.
[49:36.56]I can't move.
[49:37.12]That didn't work.
[49:47.13]Please turn up your sensitivity.
[49:48.91]Who the fuck?
[50:05.94]Alright, give me the repeater.
[50:08.56]I want a better repeater than that.
[50:10.76]I don't have, like, a better repeater than this shit.
[50:13.92]Is it on my horse or something?
[50:15.22]Probably.
[50:15.68]Oh, it looked like they were about to until you said that.
[50:22.73]More to my right.
[50:37.32]Was that bad guy?
[50:39.84]That was not a bad guy.
[50:42.73]Well, I mean, what the hell are you doing standing there?
[50:44.69]You need to get out of the way, man.
[50:47.45]There's outlaws around.
[50:49.41]You don't want to be accidentally identified as an outlaw.
[50:54.05]Because they're just... Whoever's around, I'm going to have to shoot them.
[51:01.47]I'm being attacked from all sides.
[51:13.30]How dare he stand in town.
[51:16.31]Well, not only standing in town, but standing just still, staring at me.
[51:22.83]I just, yeah, I go, well, I just got one shot.
[51:29.20]How dare he look in my direction.
[51:31.66]Come on, Arthur.
[51:32.42]We gotta get out of here, Arthur.
[51:35.46]Doesn't look like it, Arthur.
[51:38.28]Over there, to your left.
[51:40.15]Oh, jeez, Arthur.
[52:05.58]I'm sorry the guy was looking at me Well behind me is actually in front of us see look at these guys are just standing here You understand that those two guys are just standing around they just happen to be bad guys this time
[52:40.61]Holy fuck, that was a bad idea.
[52:45.81]Oh, whoa!
[52:47.49]Whoa, what was that?
[52:52.89]No, these are not... Okay.
[52:54.05]That guy's gonna be okay.
[52:59.77]Oh, no, he's not anymore.
[53:14.25]That's what I think about Kelpie, is they hit the liquor.
[53:23.93]Give me some tobacco.
[53:25.11]Oh, never mind.
[53:25.65]Never mind.
[53:44.28]I was online, something I'm gonna try again because it wasn't working very well.
[53:47.57]We'll give it a try soon here.
[53:54.13]Another mission or so, and we'll give it a go again.
[53:59.98]Weird flex, what?
[54:01.90]What?
[54:02.08]What are you talking about?
[54:04.34]What?
[54:14.58]Maybe.
[54:15.62]This place is odd.
[54:17.28]I keep seeing those fellas.
[54:19.46]Some local militia.
[54:21.74]Clearly not too happy to have some new competition.
[54:25.11]I'll go visit old mob Braithwaite.
[54:26.91]See what's what.
[54:27.91]We've been making money.
[54:29.55]The chest is filling up again slowly but surely.
[54:33.01]Part of me thinks we just get ourselves good and lost.
[54:36.24]But we still need a lot more money before that can happen.
[54:39.74]So, for now, let me go give old Mrs. Braithwaite some of this moonshine as, well, let's call it a peace offering.
[54:49.99]Sure.
[54:51.01]This guy is old me.
[54:52.01]That was fun, Fenton.
[54:54.25]We'll make an actor of you yet?
[54:57.35]I'll go speak to Dutch.
[54:58.82]I wouldn't mind.
[54:59.70]I mean, he seems like he's pretty with it.
[55:06.19]Play the entire Kingdom Hearts collection on stream.
[55:10.64]So what do you think?
[55:12.00]I don't think so.
[55:12.60]About what?
[55:13.50]The fine folks around these parts.
[55:15.74]Oh, real nice.
[55:17.18]Ow, my God.
[55:17.48]I'm going to pull my ear off.
[55:18.98]On the one side, we've got the Gray family.
[55:21.39]Scots, degenerates, drunkards, the local law.
[55:24.65]You couldn't make this stuff up.
[55:26.69]Rich as creases.
[55:27.67]This thing is jammed in my ear, wedged all the way in.
[55:30.75]And I just yanked on it accidentally, moving my butt around.
[55:32.99]And now it's just pulled off my ear.
[55:34.85]We believe in gold.
[55:37.71]And in the middle of it all, you got some inbred retelling of Romeo and Juliet.
[55:43.25]Exactly.
[55:44.96]So what you boys thinking?
[55:47.90]We try to rob them both.
[55:52.91]Everybody in the camp.
[55:54.37]Those are all different people.
[55:56.27]Okay, well...
[56:13.38]Jose has gone back to see that Braithwaite woman.
[56:15.74]Good.
[56:16.44]Jose should definitely take the lead on this.
[56:19.50]I sent Sean over to Braithwaite Manor, too.
[56:22.46]Now, you can meet up with them or join John and Javier at the Gray's place, something to do with the Braithwaite's prize horses.
[56:30.59]Can I have your ear?
[56:31.71]I'm making a voodoo doll.
[56:32.57]Okay, but can you not, like, do anything bad?
[56:34.49]Can you do, like, good things to it?
[56:35.45]Like, can you put it in, like, a nice hot bath?
[56:36.71]You know what I mean?
[56:55.88]I ain't in the revenge business, Dutch.
[56:58.06]Make like a tiny little bathtub and put it with like nice, perfectly temperature, perfect hot water, and just slowly just dunk me in there and let me relax in there, right?
[57:05.71]Now, if you will excuse me, Arthur, I got to write a letter.
[57:11.23]Set it up on a little beach chair and put me right in front of the ocean, you know, on the beach.
[57:18.63]Put sunscreen on me and just let me hang out there.
[57:34.16]What am I talking about?
[57:35.86]Did you not see the guy that just said he was gonna make a voodoo doll of me?
[57:41.01]I'm telling him not to do bad.
[57:42.57]Don't like stab me in the stomach with like knives.
[57:53.57]I'm not paying attention to chat.
[57:59.40]Perfect.
[57:59.72]I need to go hunting at some point.
[58:01.60]I need to hunt.
[58:02.46]I haven't done any of that.
[58:03.56]I've done a couple legendary animals.
[58:06.67]But not enough to do any of this stuff.
[58:13.29]I'm gonna stab a voodoo version of you with a knife.
[58:15.13]Don't do that though!
[58:18.74]Take it on vacation with you and put like sunscreen on in front of the beach!
[58:24.40]I'm gonna make a terrible... I'm not even gonna say it.
[58:55.66]Alright.
[58:57.02]So, who do we want to go to?
[58:58.28]I mean, I like... I like Hosea.
[59:01.20]So, Hosea is kind of where I want to go.
[59:03.88]Because it's Hosea.
[59:05.54]And why would I not do Hosea?
[59:07.64]Let's do this mission, and then I'm going to try online again.
[59:10.47]We'll see if we can get it to work.
[59:13.77]Well, that should be the size of a regular pillow.
[59:18.63]At least give me the benefit of the doubt of being a king-sized pillow.
[59:21.69]Please.
[59:28.78]Mr. Morgan.
[59:30.68]Mr. Morgan.
[59:31.40]Not now.
[59:32.20]Mr. Pearson.
[59:33.74]Quite a country.
[59:34.76]Not now.
[59:35.28]Quite a country.
[59:37.12]You know, sometimes I'm glad I left the Navy.
[59:39.71]Too many men.
[59:41.01]Can I leave, please?
[59:41.85]Too many men.
[59:43.19]This way.
[59:44.19]Can you hold that dog?
[59:46.01]Okay, if you're that busy, Mr. Morgan.
[59:47.67]Get away from me.
[59:51.11]Jeremy, you make a twin-sized bed look like a California king.
[59:57.11]You understand how thick my body is?
[60:08.45]My ass doesn't even fit on a twin mattress, guys.
[60:17.19]Alright, come on.
[60:18.00]Horse.
[60:29.70]Calling yourself a thicc.
[60:32.09]Well, thicc as in, like, T-H-I-C-K.
[60:42.94]CK!
[60:48.66]What happened to online?
[60:50.47]It didn't work.
[60:54.31]It was kind of broken.
[60:57.01]But we're gonna try again.
[61:13.89]Like you can never say the word thick ever again.
[61:23.79]right, let's say you're at work and You walk into your boss's office.
[61:28.19]He's like, oh, yeah, you know, could you give me a hand with something here?

[62:02.21]You're gonna get insta-fired in 15 seconds?
[62:10.35]Why not?
[62:11.47]Egomaniac thinks he's our boss?

[63:29.91]Arthur Morgan, Mrs. Catherine Braithwaite.
[63:31.95]Nice to see you again.
[63:33.05]Apparently.
[63:34.73]So this one, he is big and as dumb as he looks?
[63:37.87]Well, he's surely big, but his intelligence is a matter of some conjecture.
[63:42.21]Some say he is as dumb as he looks, but I think, well, he's not quite that dumb.
[63:48.13]He's so sick of that.
[63:48.79]Oh yes, you see.
[63:49.39]He is dumb.
[63:50.11]Thick.
[63:50.23]Yeah, he's also, he's very thick and dumb.
[63:51.75]Ha, thick.
[63:52.07]The young one says it.
[64:21.49]Can I drive?
[64:22.51]Nope.
[64:32.63]Childbirth is gross.
[64:36.41]What?
[64:36.97]Ready?
[64:37.85]Let's get out of here.
[64:38.89]Why did you just say that?
[64:43.57]You was quiet in there.
[64:45.55]Took everything I had.
[64:47.23]That son of a horse.
[64:48.87]Come on, Morgan.
[64:49.67]Pick up the pace here.
[64:52.65]I'll shove that silver spoon down his throat and pull it clean out of his ass.
[64:58.70]A smoke fucker.
[64:59.62]Okay.
[65:02.76]So what's she got us doing at the gravestone?
[65:05.62]Oh, that's going to be a bingo for me.
[65:07.99]I heard it had rained in weeks around here.
[65:10.43]What?
[65:12.31]You used enough back there.
[65:14.23]Maniac driver.
[65:15.49]Can I do one thing without destruction?
[65:16.93]It's faster.
[65:17.71]I'm going to get there faster.
[65:42.26]I just saved a good two minutes right there.
[65:44.72]I'm going to pay for those fences.
[65:45.68]This is the invoice man.
[66:09.38]Hold up a second.
[66:10.76]You're not worried about damn greys, English.
[66:14.28]You're not worried about damn greys.
[66:17.14]In what sense?
[66:18.22]Well, they knows you.
[66:19.82]Yeah, maybe you're right.
[66:22.92]You know what?
[66:24.98]I'll go hiding back.
[66:26.69]If you can act naturally and stop us from getting into a fight before we're ready.
[66:31.77]I will try.
[66:33.11]I'm trying to do an impression of a human being.
[66:36.29]I'm not going to go that far.
[66:37.39]Ha ha ha ha.
[66:47.94]Change Arthur's point of view.
[66:49.26]Okay.
[66:54.90]This feels so sneaky.
[66:56.28]No, I'm staying here.
[66:57.00]I want to be inside this.
[67:00.12]Okay.
[67:00.76]Just drink the booze.
[67:22.47]What do you want, boys?
[67:25.65]There was a ting at the saloon.
[67:28.62]There was a ting at the saloon.
[67:30.20]Well, I'm delivering the supplies.
[67:32.12]You're not the usual drab.
[67:34.64]You want a bottle, friend?
[67:35.58]Here.
[67:38.54]Have a wee drop.
[67:40.96]I've got really long arms.
[67:42.56]I mean you no harm.
[67:44.74]I've come from Donegal in Ireland.
[67:47.48]You don't say?
[67:48.69]Yeah.
[67:50.72]Is it just one guy?
[67:51.54]Do I have to hand him a drink?
[68:16.69]Alright, I'm going to, with both hands as hard as I can, grab his ankles and pull him as hard as I can through there.
[68:23.19]I'm kind of jealous.
[68:24.85]I feel like I belong up there to laugh and talk.
[68:47.13]Just over here.
[68:48.37]Yeah, it's straight down the path here.
[68:50.77]It's getting so I can barely keep track of all these deliveries coming in.
[68:54.51]Yeah, when they said they was looking for more drivers in town, I jumped at the chance.
[68:59.01]I ain't never been a feather to kick a bit of honest walk out of bed.
[69:04.14]Is he floating?
[69:04.98]You folks been having a hard time of it, have you?
[69:07.82]Yeah, Mr. Gray's got a heap of problems right now with another family around here.
[69:11.86]No, he's not.
[69:12.28]A bunch of covetous lowdowns trying to sabotage his livelihood.
[69:15.74]Disgusting.
[69:17.32]Dear oh dear.
[69:18.30]I'm sorry to hear that Hamish.
[69:20.48]Sounds like you definitely deserve that drink.
[69:22.70]No, I'm not gonna.
[69:23.90]What are you talking about?
[69:26.01]Just in there Right there
[69:38.90]Am I just gonna be in here?
[69:39.91]Am I gonna have to jump out and jump scare this guy and punch him in the face or something?
[69:45.53]How is this gonna work?
[69:57.36]Take his hat?
[70:33.50]How you getting on?
[70:34.58]Good.
[70:36.08]Nearly got these things ready.
[70:38.42]Okay.
[70:41.94]That seemed like the quickest way.
[70:45.88]There's plenty of guards out there.
[70:48.20]Here's how I feel.
[70:48.96]Should have shot him with a shotgun?
[70:50.44]No, that's too much.
[70:52.60]You head over to the dry barn.
[70:54.44]Sure.
[70:55.62]And you?
[70:56.74]I'm gonna deal with the fields themselves.
[71:00.61]We coat everything in moonshine, and then we light things up with these little fiddlers here.
[71:06.57]Thankfully, it ain't rain.
[71:08.51]And that old barn over there should go up like a torch.
[71:11.75]How many of these boys you think you need?
[71:13.15]This should do it.
[71:14.60]That'll do it.
[71:19.83]look once they get wind of us there'll be no turning back so move quickly of course I'm rebel stock boy I was barb running down manor houses we'll burn quietly alright so we're gonna torch the fields there's someone coming on the left

[71:55.00]Well, I thought the wagon already arrived.
[71:57.94]This one didn't.
[71:59.24]Sneak around.
[72:00.56]Which way are we going?
[72:01.06]Am I in his way?

[72:03.96]Payroll?

[72:12.92]Payroll.

[72:15.08]Let's get this job done first, okay?
[72:16.29]Might as well take a sip, right?
[72:18.91]Just let me deal with our friend here.
[72:37.44]Were they?
[72:39.74]Were they?
[72:40.64]Were they alerted?
[72:41.32]Yeah, and that guy's... God damn it.
[73:04.21]That noise, that was fucking loud.
[73:05.35]I thought the wagon already arrived.
[73:07.73]This one didn't.
[73:09.01]Strange.
[73:10.45]So what you got there?
[73:12.85]Tools?
[73:13.73]Payroll?
[73:14.72]OK.

[73:28.75]We'll take care of this fella.
[73:33.18]No, I'm just kidding.
[73:33.94]I'm not going to do it again.
[73:35.02]Joke.
[73:36.06]It's a joke.
[73:36.60]It's a joke.
[73:37.10]No, I'm just kidding.
[73:39.79]We want shit.
[73:40.27]We want shit.
[73:40.83]Will you let me do this?
[73:42.37]He's not going to let me do it.
[74:01.38]When hiding among tobacco plants, guards will not be able to see you as easily.
[74:04.04]Okay.
[74:06.34]How much do I have to pour?
[74:07.14]That's good.
[74:11.33]Alright, that's good.
[74:20.47]Where is that guy facing?
[74:21.35]Oh, facing this way.
[74:22.59]I'm going to wait until he turns around.
[74:27.74]Or will he turn around?
[74:30.90]Turn up the game volume?
[74:35.40]Is he gonna just look over here the whole time?
[74:40.73]I have a lot of moonshine in here apparently.
[74:49.38]Okay, yeah, you just have to do it until he says he's satisfied.
[74:54.83]So I'm gonna go across.
[74:56.75]Oh, dear.
[74:57.59]Oh, dear.
[74:57.89]Okay.
[74:58.81]This guy facing this way, not for now.
[75:01.77]I'm gonna wait till he crosses back again.
[75:03.95]This is the only guy that I need to worry about on this side, at least.
[75:21.01]Okay.
[75:21.91]Dump it.
[75:28.61]The music is dying.
[75:38.90]Angry goat music.
[75:45.35]I gotta go across that way.
[75:47.03]I wonder if you turn around.
[75:50.51]Probably.
[75:57.02]Not really.
[75:57.48]I could go to the left.
[76:01.02]Or, uh, no, I'm not gonna go now.
[76:07.86]Once he comes back this way, I think I can make it.
[76:15.16]Come on.
[76:15.42]Turn, turn, turn.
[76:16.98]Turn before it's too late.
[76:21.82]Thank you.
[76:33.11]Alright.
[76:33.45]Cause a problem over here too.
[76:35.71]Turn up the mic.
[76:37.29]Whose mic?
[76:38.35]My mic?
[76:41.31]That should do it.
[76:47.77]That's a long mission, huh?
[76:56.40]Just one more on the other side.
[77:01.18]Anybody else looking over here?
[77:02.18]Or can I just go right behind him right now?
[77:04.66]Pretty sure I can get behind him right now.
[77:06.17]Yep.
[77:15.33]Something, something, Far Cry 3.
[77:21.56]We're in the barn.
[77:22.76]We should be able to wrap around here.
[77:29.65]Should I go for it?
[77:31.01]No, no, no.
[77:32.09]Should I go for it?
[77:33.27]No, he's gonna turn.
[77:33.87]He's gonna turn.
[77:34.53]We can see him when he turns.
[77:40.83]I could've gone.
[77:41.93]No, I couldn't have.
[77:44.25]Do it, you wuss.
[77:44.99]No, I don't want to do this mission again.
[77:46.12]I don't want to fail this.
[78:01.60]I'm gonna have to go around him.
[78:02.68]Actually, maybe not.
[78:05.26]We can just go this way.
[78:08.93]Yeah, let's go wrap around now.
[78:19.73]Now you are down there?
[78:21.41]There's no more guards around here, right?
[78:27.26]Am I...
[78:36.05]Dowsing the guy?
[78:39.81]Just the guy.
[78:40.23]Get out!
[79:06.36]You almost ran into the field.
[79:07.56]I did almost run into the field.
[79:12.42]You are correct.
[79:49.09]oh I remember the heart oh right there
[80:11.20]Wait, what was that?
[80:12.94]We lost the horses.
[80:14.16]Okay, apparently the horses are gone.
[80:19.24]I'm right next to you.
[80:53.28]Forehead, yeah.
[80:54.64]Right in the forehead.
[80:55.88]This is really cool though.
[81:17.43]I mean, it is kind of, hey, get out and shoot the bad guys.
[81:22.37]Hey, there it is.
[81:24.25]Maybe they haven't unloaded that cache yet.
[81:26.79]I was about to shoot that voice.
[81:28.85]Alright, come on.
[81:30.55]We'll take those horses.
[81:35.81]Well, let's see if the payroll is actually in there.
[81:38.45]Hurry up.
[81:40.16]Okay, uh, free the horse.
[81:41.62]Let's go.
[81:42.12]Okay, the horse is free.
[81:43.46]The horse is free.
[81:44.71]The horse is not free.
[81:45.71]Free.
[81:46.15]Oh, I had to wait.
[81:48.49]I just got thrown off.
[82:09.65]Don't ride in the fire.
[82:11.33]I know I would probably accidentally do it.
[82:14.82]Gotta leave him.
[82:20.78]Leave him.
[82:26.59]Oh, I have to jump over those.
[82:31.15]Wow.
[82:31.39]Okay.
[82:43.16]Wow.
[82:43.42]At least the music is overpowering.
[82:46.70]Music's pretty good.
[83:14.36]I didn't read the whole thing?
[83:17.22]What was the whole thing?
[83:19.22]Oh, it's loud.
[83:19.58]Um, yeah.
[83:48.19]Turn the mic up.
[83:48.79]My mic is currently... Actually, it's funny you say that because I am investing in a new audio system.
[84:04.11]So I will be sounding much better in like a week or two.
[84:11.15]Because I'm actually going to use a... I have a XLR device, but it's not necessarily like, compressor and gain and... So, I'm trying to... I want to get one.
[84:24.57]I'm not going to do too much to it, because I just want to make the audio cleaner and be able to change on the fly easily how loud or soft I am, so...
[84:39.68]So I'm not going to really add that much equalization or compression, so I'm not going to sound that different.
[84:45.88]I'm just going to be able to adjust it easier.
[84:51.21]Alright, so what time is it?
[84:53.23]Is it time for us to try online again?
[84:55.35]I think it might be.
[84:57.63]Or you can turn the volume up.
[84:58.55]The volume is up as loud as it can go.
[85:00.89]This device that I have this plugged into is not the greatest.
[85:05.87]I mean, it's a... It's a Scarlett Solo.
[85:09.15]So it's good.
[85:11.21]But it's really, really hard to use.
[85:15.03]The thing is incredibly finicky.
[85:20.85]I think I gave everything I needed.
[85:22.76]Well, I have $3,700 though.
[85:24.76]Yeah, hold on.
[85:25.26]Let me give them some money.
[85:29.06]Do this mission first?
[85:29.88]Okay.
[85:37.54]We'll do this last mission.
[85:39.74]I'm going to give like 300 bucks.
[85:48.07]And is there anything new in the ledger?
[85:56.79]I don't think so.
[85:59.73]I do need more provisions, though.
[86:01.07]Let's buy it all.
[86:09.39]Buy it all.
[86:10.17]Okay.
[86:14.29]Well, I can't do anything.
[86:22.61]Everybody gives two bucks.
[86:26.14]Well, I'm gonna give more than that.
[86:28.84]Hey Dutch.
[86:30.14]You, uh, you decent in there?
[86:34.31]No, that's not the front of his tent.
[86:36.99]That's the back of the tent.
[86:39.77]Whoops.
[86:41.61]Wait, what?
[86:42.17]No, it doesn't matter.
[86:43.51]Open the tent up.
[86:51.36]You You don't want me to come in?
[86:54.52]Sit.
[86:58.24]Should I just wait for him?
[87:04.93]Dutch?
[87:08.27]What is wrong with his arm?
[87:18.46]What is he doing?
[87:22.92]I can't walk in.
[87:24.12]I'm trying right now.
[87:26.50]Something's wrong with him.
[87:34.74]Just grab his hand.
[87:49.09]I can't do anything.
[87:49.73]Alright, well, I'm just gonna... I just ate something.
[87:53.63]Whatever.
[87:57.81]Ooh, candy!
[88:09.33]What now?
[88:09.99]You sweating yet, Dutch?
[88:11.31]Of course I'm sweating.
[88:13.14]We're in some disease-ridden, swampy, dizzy-whistling shithole.
[88:17.40]I meant about what Trelawney said about these guys.
[88:20.18]I'm not sweating as such, but maybe a little gentle perspiration.
[88:24.73]Until we know more, ain't too much harm in wasting good liquor on sweating.
[88:29.59]So...
[88:30.89]so I think you should pay Mr. trelawney a visit and find out exactly what he knows and who he spoke to take Charles with you you got the side of the pair you would make a statue sing out its secrets okay go to Charles hey Charles you and I are going to be working together here
[88:56.98]Oh, no.
[88:57.28]Wrong guy.
[88:57.82]Hey, Charles.
[88:58.18]Come with me.
[88:58.64]Why does the screen keep flashing?
[88:59.96]I don't...
[89:26.78]I don't see anything on my end.
[89:27.86]Hopefully that's not something wrong with your computer.
[89:36.30]Is he coming?
[89:38.18]No, where is he?
[89:42.01]Why do I think everybody's the same character?
[89:44.27]Where am I going?
[89:59.99]Get on the horse!
[90:01.15]Why is my game fucking up?
[90:05.30]What?!
[90:11.34]I can't get on the horse.
[90:13.73]Okay, that was weird.
[90:24.68]I rode too close to the camp.
[90:26.86]Well, he was on a horse.
[90:28.74]We were both... We were hitched and I was walking right next to him.
[90:32.95]Something like that.
[90:44.29]As soon as we laid eyes on that fool of a sheriff who runs that town, I knew Dutch was gonna play him like a fiddle.
[90:51.90]Stop yelling at me.
[90:53.50]Working for another.
[90:55.88]Interesting.
[90:56.50]Alright, let's do it.
[90:57.76]I'm in plain sight, Dutch calls it.
[91:02.84]We almost sandwiched that guy.
[91:04.82]Spirit seemed good.
[91:06.32]In the new camp, I mean.
[91:07.82]We got some space between us and that mess now.
[91:10.88]Ain't she...

[91:13.94]So we'll try online again after this mission.
[91:16.48]See if we can get another decent session out of it.

[91:40.15]Otto ate earlier today.
[91:41.83]Before I started streaming, he ate.
[91:43.43]He had some delicious dog food.
[91:44.85]Wait, didn't I... I think I jumped off this roof already.
[91:46.49]Yeah, I did.
[92:16.47]Search the caravan.
[92:21.01]Well.
[92:23.03]That's not a clue, but it's a caravan made.
[92:24.97]It's a clue.

[94:55.71]He gets bored very easily.
[94:57.16]So if he's in here with me... Oh, he's lying down on a bed or a blanket back here.
[95:01.88]Oh, okay.
[95:03.45]After two hours, he's just like, get me out of here.

[95:32.61]I think the tracks lead this way.
[95:44.56]Well, that... I was going the wrong way, wasn't I?
[95:46.66]Well, I found him.
[95:50.02]What are you doing?

[98:16.88]That guy had 25 bucks on him.
[98:21.65]Come on, let's go.
[98:23.57]Yeah!
[98:23.75]Alright, we're looking for the path this way.
[98:28.01]I think there's a way around so we don't have to go through the Braithwaite's place.
[98:31.53]Okay.
[98:32.37]I'll let you lead.
[98:33.71]I've spent enough time there.
[98:36.31]After you, then.
[98:42.30]I'm good.
[98:43.14]What do you think they want with Trelawney?
[98:45.10]Could be any one of a hundred things.
[98:50.51]Just depends if any of them involve us.
[98:53.77]You think he'll talk?
[98:54.55]Of course he will.
[98:56.29]You okay over there?
[98:57.15]I'm good.
[98:57.73]He'd sell his own sister to save a train fare.
[99:00.53]He don't know how not to talk.
[99:03.63]He don't know where we'll hold up, though.
[99:06.24]At least I don't think he does.
[99:08.48]I don't know why Dutch still deals with him.
[99:10.82]Oh, he's disappearing for weeks on end.
[99:13.14]He's got his uses.
[99:15.06]And, well, loyalty matters to Dutch.
[99:19.13]Of course.
[99:20.71]Dutch Vanderlyn.
[99:23.15]Let me tell you boys something.
[99:25.47]Dutch Vanderlyn's boys are... Nobody can do that voice.
[99:32.38]He has the most distinct voice I've ever heard.
[99:39.40]It's so deep.
[99:41.72]And so distinct.
[99:43.22]I have a plan.
[99:44.14]No.
[99:45.38]I have a plan.
[99:47.44]I have to be four or five octaves lower.
[99:49.68]But the one thing about Dutch that's interesting is when he yells... He goes from this to...
[100:07.81]It's actually really funny.
[100:09.81]He's like, now you get those boys out of here and bring them to the other side.
[100:21.56]I love it.
[100:22.10]It's so real.
[100:32.03]His voice just breaks when he gets to a certain amount of power behind it.
[100:37.38]His voice is too powerful.
[100:44.98]I love Dutch's voice so much.
[100:46.48]If only I was that talented.
[100:49.34]When are we trying online again?
[100:57.93]After this mission.
[100:59.99]After this mission, I'm going to go take a bathroom break.
[101:05.16]And then... After that...
[101:08.67]We'll try online, see if we can get it to work.
[101:10.67]Another hour or two maybe and see where we are.
[101:12.39]Why don't I take the horse?
[101:38.43]No horse.
[101:44.03]Should I shoot?
[101:46.11]Look and listen for disturbances in the cornfields.
[101:49.73]Disturbances?
[101:50.57]I gotta look for a disturbance in the forest.
[101:52.13]Wait, what's this?
[101:57.69]What was that blip on the map that was right here?
[102:05.21]What was it showing me?
[102:11.03]Oh, right here, right here.
[102:21.27]Thanks for being... What do I do with him?
[102:26.41]Is that it?
[102:35.38]I gotta find the other guy.
[102:38.18]You boys ain't leaving here.
[102:41.52]I saw the blip over here.
[102:42.80]Got him.
[102:43.16]Almost.
[102:43.38]Close.
[103:10.95]Look for the birds.
[103:11.77]Birds?
[103:16.46]Down here?
[103:21.60]That way, Arthur!
[103:29.05]Idiot hat tunnel vision.
[103:49.05]Wait.
[103:50.63]Was we supposed to do this together?
[103:53.61]No.
[103:53.95]Okay.
[103:56.39]He dumped his gear.
[103:57.63]He's somewhere around here.
[104:02.93]He's dumped his... Where the fuck were you?
[104:06.92]Okay.
[104:08.34]This is scripted.
[104:12.72]Let me take him and get out of here.
[104:16.08]Ooh.
[104:16.38]Nice.
[104:16.62]That was a good toss.
[104:17.79]Yeah.
[104:44.97]Charles, that was pretty godlike.
[104:52.32]How can they see us here?
[104:57.66]That was a warning shot!
[105:16.40]They sense the disturbance in the corn.
[105:19.16]Alright, I gotta put on the... let's go to the... just, uh, Schofields.
[105:23.52]That works.
[105:36.95]Good.
[105:37.93]You should be the last of them.
[105:41.23]Alright, let's go back for Trelawney.
[105:45.69]What is it?
[105:47.07]Is that a good gun on the ground?
[105:49.39]I gotta take a look at the gun on the ground.
[106:12.23]It's good.
[106:12.75]I'm gonna take it.
[106:13.19]What is it?
[106:13.83]Rare?
[106:14.21]Whoa.
[106:14.61]Rare.
[106:14.97]I saw rare.
[106:40.98]Lancaster Peter for rare rolling block rifle.
[106:48.86]Rare.
[106:54.38]Okay.
[106:57.52]Don't I have a... I'll have a bolt action.
[107:04.17]That's kind of cool.
[107:09.07]Let me see it.
[107:14.96]Ooh, it's engraved, too.
[107:20.02]Weapons clean.
[107:27.33]Well, that's pretty neat.
[107:29.41]I have to go, uh...
[107:41.62]I gotta go put this, uh, upgrade this and get this all decked out, you know?
[107:50.51]Through the corn.
[107:51.13]Alright, do you need to get on my horse, or...?
[107:54.19]You got a horse, right?
[107:57.91]Tactical engraving.
[108:00.81]Oh, you can't with rares, okay.
[108:03.76]Mr. Trelawney, where are you?
[108:07.30]Over here, dear boy.
[108:10.28]You okay?
[108:13.31]So, who was they?
[108:15.65]They were bounty hunters.
[108:18.67]Attached to Cole Stoudemire.
[108:20.46]I remember this guy.
[108:21.82]They weren't looking for me, per se.
[108:27.18]What'd you tell them?
[108:28.10]Not much.
[108:29.30]I told them I was an intellectual.
[108:33.45]Come down here from Oregon.
[108:35.53]Looking for a job at the university.
[108:38.49]Of course...
[108:43.12]Seems you stirred up quite a hornet's nest in Blackwater.
[108:46.57]He made the reference?
[108:47.45]Metal Gear stream?
[108:48.33]What do you mean, Metal Gear?
[108:49.07]Might be best if I stay with you gentlemen for a while.
[108:52.97]Can't go back to that caravan now.
[108:54.75]Alright, Charles.
[108:56.15]You take Trelawney back to camp.
[108:57.89]I'll catch up with you.
[108:59.01]OK.
[108:59.13]Looks dumb and thick.
[109:07.29]Bounty hunters.
[109:08.55]Inkerton's lawmen.
[109:10.33]Is chapter 3 incoming here?
[109:11.19]Everywhere we go.
[109:13.27]We're still pretending to be... We are still pretending to be lawmen.
[109:35.45]Okay.
[109:35.97]So, we are at the five hour mark of the stream.
[109:41.05]We gave about two through just about an hour and a half in single player.
[109:45.61]Let's see if it was enough.
[109:47.64]I'm going to grab a drink.
[109:48.28]I'll be right back.
[109:48.88]We're going to try to open up multiplayer again.
[109:52.02]I'll see you in two minutes.
