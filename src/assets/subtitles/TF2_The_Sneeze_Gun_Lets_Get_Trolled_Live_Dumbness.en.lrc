[00:03.88]Is that electricity on your head?
[00:06.14]That is electricity on my face.
[00:08.08]So that's a new unusual.
[00:09.02]Is that like one of the new ones?
[00:11.09]That's one of the new ones.
[00:12.33]Cool.
[00:12.77]I'll give you a high five, bro.
[00:15.95]Yay!
[00:17.03]Electricity!
[00:23.99]You okay, mate?
[00:39.32]The Sneeze Gun.
[00:41.14]If I had a name tag, I would just rename this to the Sneeze Gun right now.
[00:46.98]I don't have any name tags, but I will.
[00:48.78]Eventually this will be the Sneeze Gun, and you'll understand why very shortly.
[00:56.31]Alright.
[00:57.53]Who wants to get destroyed by the Schneeze Gun?
[01:02.83]This scout right here?
[01:03.83]Did you say you wanted to get sneezed on?
[01:06.47]Oh, okay.
[01:07.66]What about this spy?
[01:08.44]Oh, he's already dead.
[01:12.02]Oh, man.
[01:13.18]I'm sorry, I can't control my cold!
[01:16.98]I'm gonna get headshot.
[01:30.95]Man, I gotta call into work today.
[01:35.43]God, I'm sorry, guys.
[01:40.15]I really gotta put on one of those masks.
[01:43.28]So sorry about all that.
[01:53.38]Now you just sound like Ace Ventura.
[01:58.45]I forget which part, but it's the part when he's like... When he's climbing out the rhino's ass.
[02:03.35]There you go.
[02:03.67]And he's just like... When he's climbing out the rhino's ass.
[02:10.05]It actually worked!
[02:24.51]Congregation of the Spies.
[02:27.01]This is where they do all their work.
[02:29.83]The Spies always do lots of work.
[02:33.45]Back to work.
[02:35.71]They don't know I'm looking at them.
[02:38.88]That Spie does not look like he's very happy.
[02:42.72]Get out of the way.
[02:43.48]I don't have a hat, Spie!
[02:54.18]I want to get up there.
[02:55.28]I want to get up there and I want to taunt kill that sniper.
[03:01.08]Wow, that was pretty brutal.
[03:02.62]I like took his head off.
[03:03.90]I took his head clean off with that swing.
[03:06.85]And that guy.
[03:08.63]And this guy.
[03:11.05]No, don't kill me.
[03:12.71]I'm just a DMO man.
[03:13.75]Uh-oh.
[03:14.39]Uh-oh.
[03:15.73]Uh-oh.
[03:19.41]Uh-oh, Spy!
[03:20.17]Get out of here, Spy!
[03:26.70]Are you... Have you been sword fighting again, Gemma?
[03:39.87]No, dude!
[03:40.96]Dude, I'm still here!
[03:42.82]Sword fighting!
[03:43.62]I killed the answers!
[03:49.28]No, please let me live!
[03:50.58]Let me live!
[04:03.45]Is this guy seriously just gonna stand right here?
[04:06.52]He's not gonna let me do this, is he?
[04:12.82]Please don't put a sentry here, Engie.
[04:14.12]Please don't do it.
[04:15.18]He's trying.
[04:15.76]I know.
[04:17.85]Don't do it, dude.
[04:18.61]Oh my god.
[04:21.77]Did he?
[04:22.37]Hey, Demo.
[04:24.11]Come over here, mate.
[04:26.10]There's a prize.
[04:26.74]Hold on.
[04:27.83]Hold on a second.
[04:30.29]I'll help you.
[04:30.97]I'll help you out.
[04:34.89]Wow.
[04:36.77]Well, if anybody walks down there on the rail, they're fucking dead.
[04:40.35]Oh my god, dude.
[04:44.17]This is going to instantly kill anyone that comes over here.
[04:47.29]Even if they take a peep through that window, they are fucked.
[04:52.29]Like, I would move this, but I think we should just keep it here for, you know, decorations.
[04:56.07]I think it looks kind of pretty.
[04:57.39]Yeah, kind of.
[04:57.75]We should all get Wranglers and get just big bubbles.
[05:00.20]Yeah, this is gonna be good.
[05:02.58]Oh, look, this person on the car.
[05:04.64]Sentries, go!
[05:05.38]Now's your chance!
[05:06.66]Do it!
[05:07.20]Sentry!
[05:07.46]They didn't do shit!
[05:08.02]They didn't do anything.
[05:09.87]It's because I've bubbled mine.
[05:14.19]I want to get, like, a good view.
[05:16.59]Oh look, look how good we are.
[05:18.27]We built three centuries back to each other.
[05:20.11]Look, kill this bumble.
[05:21.19]He's coming up the stairs.
[05:22.33]Where is he?
[05:23.21]This asshole.
[05:23.87]The spy.
[05:24.55]He's got my like... You'll recognize him.
[05:27.91]There he is.
[05:28.33]There's two of us.
[05:29.55]What?
[05:31.57]I don't know which one is you.
[05:33.77]I'm chasing him right now.
[05:35.49]Oh, so you're the one... Are you in front of him?
[05:37.48]There we go.
[05:38.28]Jeez, there's another one.
[05:43.52]I seriously did not know- Oh, there he is!
[05:44.92]He's here again!
[05:45.40]He's here!
[05:46.49]He's gonna- He almost stair-stabbed me!
[05:48.23]Get him!
[05:49.31]No!
[05:49.69]He face-stabbed me!
[05:52.63]Why is he doing this to me all the time?
[05:54.01]He's face-stabbed me twice!
[05:55.29]I hate spies!
[05:57.47]Shit!
[06:02.54]Alright, I'm gonna get some metal first.
[06:04.14]Alright, let's go.
[06:06.26]We gotta hurry up.
[06:06.88]We got, like, a train to catch.
[06:10.46]Oh, the sentry train.
[06:12.64]Yeah, with the payload.
[06:13.38]We gotta get on that payload train.
[06:15.33]Three, two, one, moving out.
[06:17.21]Let's do it.
[06:20.63]If I get backstabbed and this dies, I will be so upset.
[06:23.89]On the railroad.
[06:26.75]On a live long day.
[06:28.12]Keep going, keep going.
[06:29.54]Oh, keep going?
[06:30.90]No!
[06:32.92]Keep going, he says.
[06:34.88]Keep going.
[06:36.20]We must push further up the hill.
[06:37.80]No!
[06:43.19]Oh, we're doing the upward parade of engineers.
[06:45.30]I protect you, you protect me.
[06:46.86]I don't see a spy.
[06:47.82]Pyro, pyro, pyro, pyro.
[06:49.18]What?
[06:50.02]And a scout.
[06:50.78]Put it down, put it down.
[06:51.96]Quick.
[06:53.46]Get it down.
[06:54.86]I don't have any metal.
[06:56.75]Yours is facing the wrong way.
[06:58.57]There's a spy.
[06:59.83]There's a spy.
[07:01.93]Oh, no.
[07:02.81]No.
[07:03.03]There's a sapper.
[07:04.63]Yours is facing the wrong way.
[07:06.83]He's trying to stair stab me.
[07:07.90]He's going to face stab me again.
[07:09.12]I know it.
[07:10.44]He's dead.
[07:11.52]Alright, my sentry died.
[07:12.62]He just poked it once because it got sapped to shit.
[07:16.55]I ran out of metal.
[07:18.41]This is shit.
[07:19.37]You got another one?
[07:21.55]Yeah, I need more metal.
[07:23.51]Put him down!
[07:23.93]Put him down!
[07:27.69]We're gonna win.
[07:28.19]Alright, quick, get him in.
[07:30.25]Get him inside before we win.
[07:32.66]Get him in front of the spawn door.
[07:33.50]We need to make ourselves look useful.
[07:34.32]Get him in front of the spawn door.
[07:35.28]In front of the spawn door.
[07:35.98]Right here.
[07:37.44]Come on!
[07:40.06]Build you piece of shit!
[07:41.48]Come on!
[07:42.18]Quicker!
[07:42.64]Quicker!
[07:44.32]Oh no, yay.
[07:45.72]We did nothing, goodness me.
[07:51.73]That was so dumb.
[07:53.15]We didn't even build a teleporter or a dispenser.
[07:55.89]We didn't do fucking anything.
[07:57.69]We did nothing.
