[00:09.42]Roll up your sleeves.
[00:10.83]Everybody roll your sleeves up.
[00:12.07]Hold on, I'm going to roll my sleeves up.
[00:13.47]Because you know why we're rolling the sleeves up?
[00:14.73]We're on one of the coolest maps in the game.
[00:16.75]We're on the main thunder.
[00:18.37]The striking thunder.
[00:19.77]The big thunder.
[00:21.15]Thunder Mountain, baby.
[00:22.27]Crash that.
[00:22.99]Blah.
[00:27.23]Why is it a fucking Egypt?
[00:28.31]What?
[00:28.55]No, no, no, no.
[00:29.59]I like Egypt.
[00:30.09]Please, please, please, please.
[00:31.63]No, no, no.
[00:32.07]Please, please, please, please, please, please.
[00:33.89]This is supposed to be Thunder Mountain.
[00:35.40]Please, please, please.
[00:36.14]The title of this video was Bring on the Thunder, and we're not even on Thunder Mountain.
[00:42.08]Uh, how about Double Flogeistinator Pyros?
[00:45.32]That sounds dumb enough to work.
[00:46.78]Okay, Double Flogeistinator, Flogeistinator, Flogeistinator.
[00:49.64]Are you ready?
[00:51.59]Oh, everybody, welcome to Thunder Mountain.
[00:54.05]Tricked you.
[00:54.65]It's Egypt, and we're both Flog Pyros.
[01:02.44]Did I hit that?
[01:02.96]I hit that guy again?
[01:04.14]Here we go, baby.
[01:07.64]Turn it up.
[01:08.50]Turn on those grits!
[01:11.29]That's two.
[01:12.43]That's three.
[01:14.09]I can't go over there anymore.
[01:14.95]That's a sentry.
[01:15.53]Yeah, I can't really go over there.
[01:18.13]Did you die for the sentry?
[01:19.05]What killed you?
[01:20.05]I'm not dead.
[01:21.55]I'm at the secret entrance.
[01:23.52]Secret entrance.
[01:24.24]Do they have two sentries?
[01:25.18]I can't even tell.
[01:26.18]I can't even tell either, because I'm not really... That guy, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[01:31.87]You ready?
[01:33.00]Go, go, go.
[01:33.74]Let's go, go, go.
[01:35.48]Hold the button down.
[01:36.04]That's the most important thing.
[01:39.74]That's kind of obstructing my view.
[01:41.12]Stop doing that.
[01:42.40]No.
[01:44.02]Sentry's going to kill us.
[01:45.04]You're not going to make it.
[01:46.14]Where are you going?
[01:47.16]I'm going.
[01:47.60]Come with me.
[01:48.16]No.
[01:48.46]You're just going to let me die in the corner.
[01:50.33]Well, there's a sentry over here.
[01:54.93]Nobody here.
[01:55.75]This isn't the tunnel that I was talking about.
[01:57.61]It's alright.
[01:57.87]We can just go to spawn.
[01:59.51]Okay.
[02:00.03]Let's do that.
[02:01.72]Let me just hide right here.
[02:03.14]Don't make any noise.
[02:05.88]Oh, anyone who's down here, I got.
[02:07.78]You just stepped on a stick and it made some noise.
[02:10.99]You're on a stick.
[02:13.23]Yeah.
[02:14.49]It was a very large branch and it went.
[02:17.57]Why are we doing this?
[02:18.59]Why is nobody coming over here?
[02:19.87]Because they have a teleporter.
[02:21.13]They do?
[02:21.52]Oh, well, let's get rid of that.
[02:23.50]Let's go take care of that.
[02:26.84]What the hell is this?
[02:27.58]It's just a hat.
[02:29.18]Yeah, no, bitchy medic.
[02:32.24]Alright, how do we hide?
[02:32.80]Hide, hide, hide, hide.
[02:35.21]Help, help.
[02:37.19]We're not supposed to be here.
[02:38.15]We're supposed to... We're supposed to be here.
[02:40.39]Are we really supposed to be here?
[02:41.43]Is this really what it is?
[02:41.97]When I have crits at their gate, we're supposed to be here.
[02:46.14]Is this really what we're doing?
[02:47.38]This is what we're doing today.
[02:48.76]Are we this much of, like, douchebags?
[02:51.38]Wanna be two douchebags on dumps full?
[02:56.00]No, we're not doing this.
[02:57.01]I don't want to do this.
[02:58.97]No, I don't want to do this.
[03:02.31]This is horrible.
[03:04.09]This is... I'm glad I died.
[03:05.67]Worst Simpsons joke ever.
[03:12.26]Worst joke ever.
[03:15.44]Who's that?
[03:16.24]You get 20 Jerma Bucks if you can say who that is.
[03:19.36]Worst episode ever.
[03:22.56]Al Gore.
[03:23.37]Got it.
[03:24.05]Al Gore, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:25.99]Star wins the 20 Jerma Bucks.
[03:28.31]What are you going to buy?
[03:29.11]There was no contest.
[03:29.87]Nobody else is even in this call.
[03:32.75]Okay, time to turn it on.
[03:33.65]I'm going out left.
[03:34.93]I'm turning it out left.
[03:35.54]You're going to bring the thunder?
[03:36.84]Yeah, I'm bringing the thunder to Dustbowl.
[03:40.08]I'll show you how you bring the thunder to Dustbowl.
[03:43.80]You take a couple of pot shots right there.
[03:46.00]Watch it.
[03:47.86]I don't know where that guy went.
[03:49.76]That guy disappeared.
[03:50.89]Oh, that's a spy.
[03:53.69]Where is he?
[03:54.45]Give me some coordinates.
[03:56.13]Tunnel left side.
[03:58.05]Bravo Bango.
[03:59.45]Bravo Bango got him.
[04:00.41]He got the heavy.
[04:01.57]Bravo Bango.
[04:05.05]Thanks for the wrong coordinates.
[04:06.29]This is Bronco Bongo, you idiot.
[04:10.29]Should've told me the right coordinates, if you- See?
[04:12.93]And instead- Instead, I ended up going to Bringo Vingo, and I ended up getting myself killed.
[04:20.54]Ohohohoho, headshot!
[04:23.76]Oh, watch out for this guy!
[04:24.72]Watch out for this sniper!
[04:25.42]Ohohohoho!
[04:26.92]What, have we got any more?
[04:27.48]We got any more?
[04:28.78]Got any more peeps?
[04:30.44]We got any more creeps?
[04:31.92]We got any more sweeps and creeps and beeps?
[04:34.08]Eat a whole box of creeps in one sitting?
[04:36.47]Peeps?
[04:37.19]Dude, one time I ate a whole- Just tell me your poop scenario.
[04:40.49]Dude, did I ever tell you the story where I ate the whole sleeve of Oreo cookies and I threw up in my mother's bed?
[04:45.43]No, that sounds like a good story.
[04:49.15]Like, why wouldn't you tell this?
[04:51.11]It was actually pretty recently.
[04:52.72]Dude, I threw... This is like when I was in... What the fuck was that?
[05:00.74]Wait, wait, you mean recently.
[05:03.32]You recently threw up in your mother's bed.
[05:06.71]And you couldn't prevent this from happening.
[05:08.24]You couldn't, like, lean to the side.
[05:10.12]This isn't like a mother's floor carpet throw-up story.
[05:14.80]You demolished her bed.
[05:16.06]Did you have to get a new mattress?
[05:17.31]Because that shit goes right through.
[05:18.47]I don't think so.
[05:22.73]So every night she goes to bed, does she just think about, like, what's going on here?
[05:28.00]Maybe, I mean, it's kind of fucked up.
[05:31.42]Alright, where are coordinates?
[05:32.90]Coordinates, Brinko Bongo!
[05:34.18]Can we hear the story?
[05:35.70]No, I'm too busy.
[05:36.30]Oh, I don't need a second, man.
[05:42.75]I'm trying to play a good game of Dubs Bowl over here.
[05:45.51]We actually are gonna steamroll now.
[05:47.31]Okay.
[05:49.01]Is that confirmation?
[05:50.69]This is confirmation.
[05:52.61]Go ahead and call up the hotline.
[05:55.11]Okay, hotline is, um, Brinko Bongo...
[05:58.31]Hello?
[05:59.07]Hello?
[05:59.77]This is the Team Fortress 2 StompFest hotline.
[06:02.31]Who's speaking, please?
[06:03.55]STAR_.
[06:05.15]Okay, yeah, what is your inquiry?
[06:06.87]Um, I wanted to pub stomp Dubs Bowl, but... Okay, uh, do you have Jerma985 pocket-medicating you right now?
[06:14.16]It's this guy named Stadium Seating, but I guess it could be Jerma.
[06:17.48]Okay, then, uh, that has been confirmed.
[06:19.32]You will do a steamroll, my friend.
[06:20.64]Thank you for calling Team Fortress 2 StompFest hotline.
[06:22.54]Okay, can we get the Uber?
[06:23.46]Can you speed it up the process here?
[06:26.98]They hung up on you.
[06:27.78]You were too abrasive.
[06:30.02]No, they have to apologize first.
[06:32.22]That's like what they do.
[06:32.95]Don't get blown off by this guy either.
[06:35.05]I'm not going to.
[06:35.73]You're going to.
[06:36.41]I did.
[06:36.89]You are going to.
[06:38.07]You're such an idiot.
[06:39.33]You didn't protect me!
[06:40.31]Ring, ring, ring!
[06:44.39]They're out to lunch.
[06:46.26]Ooh, you hear all those dings?
[06:47.56]Yeah.
[06:52.78]Did you hear all those dings?
[06:55.18]Oh, what?
[06:56.56]Oh, crit.
[06:59.10]I did not aim that.
[07:00.54]Hold on, I gotta help this, uh, Engie.
[07:03.28]I don't care as long as we get the Yuba.
[07:05.67]We'll have it.
[07:07.57]Spy!
[07:08.17]Spy!
[07:08.81]Spy!
[07:09.11]Ah!
[07:11.03]Spy.
[07:12.09]Spy scout.
[07:14.71]You ready for the, uh... Yeah, I'm very ready.
[07:20.00]Okay, you ready?
[07:22.08]Yes.
[07:23.30]98.
[07:23.32]99.
[07:23.34]100.
[07:25.64]Oh my god, again.
[07:26.64]Holy shit, dude.
[07:28.31]There is like five centuries back here.
[07:31.31]You've gotta be kidding me.
[07:32.99]I'm gonna need stickies.
[07:34.83]That's my evaluation.
[07:38.51]Don't get yourself killed.
[07:40.01]I'm gonna have one uber for you.
[07:41.59]You have to really make it count.
[07:43.28]Okay, back up.
[07:43.60]Make sure we get this, because I know Jerma.
[07:45.76]In times of crisis, he throws.
[07:49.02]In times of crisis.
[07:50.14]In times of crisis.
[07:53.32]Got those stickies.
[07:54.70]Come on.
[07:56.10]Come on, we can't have the Team Fortress 2 stomp-fest hotline lie to us.
[08:00.78]Still one in this entry!
[08:03.32]Oh!
[08:04.70]Come on!
[08:06.44]Can we at least get on that point?
[08:10.44]I died.
[08:11.38]I got crit.
[08:15.33]Oh my god!
[08:17.04]No!
[08:18.44]They have, like, the perfect team.
[08:22.78]No, they just have, like, six engineers.
[08:24.58]That's what I mean.
[08:25.17]They have that many NGs.
[08:26.91]Medics.
[08:27.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:29.55]We're just bomb rushing it right now.
[08:32.31]We are totally bomb rushing.
[08:34.69]Everyone just rush it.
[08:37.29]There's only two people on that point.
[08:39.65]There's still two sentries around the corner.
[08:44.72]What a joke.
[08:46.84]TF2 hotline is now not in service anymore.
[08:51.11]I ripped the phone out of the wall.
