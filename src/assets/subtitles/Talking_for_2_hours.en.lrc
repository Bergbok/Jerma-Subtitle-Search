[00:50.98]Why is this not working?
[00:53.20]Is my webcam broken?
[00:56.74]Are we going to add insult to injury tonight?
[00:58.66]Is that what we're going to do?
[01:04.44]Let's add insult to injury.
[01:06.60]I have to buy another webcam.
[01:07.86]No, there it is.
[01:17.32]Not quite.
[01:21.10]Here comes the joke.
[01:23.44]No, there's no joke here.
[01:36.15]Hi.
[01:36.26]Oh, let me move it to, let me get to a decent spot.
[01:41.22]Why is it dark in here?
[01:46.14]What made this so dark?
[01:47.94]Look at these fuzzies.
[01:49.42]Look at this little growth I have back here of hair.
[01:53.20]Let's see if I can turn this up.
[01:59.20]Hey, there we go.
[01:59.87]I can.
[02:02.57]Turn the gain up.
[02:10.51]Wait a minute.
[02:11.51]Wait a minute.
[02:11.87]Let me cover this.
[02:17.81]Reset the transformation.
[02:22.75]Why is this... Why are you in such a tiny resolution?
[02:31.20]Custom resolution, 1920 by 1080.
[02:35.60]Are you out of your mind?
[02:40.22]Hey, look at that, now you can actually see me.
[02:43.88]There we go, okay.
[02:47.20]My chair is all fucked up now.
[02:50.08]Hi guys, welcome to a IRL portion of the stream.
[02:53.96]So let's move this over here, that makes it easier for me.
[02:59.62]This is called Jeremy the Pissy Little Shit.
[03:05.42]Those scan lines, are they really bad scan lines?
[03:12.66]Here we go.
[03:15.06]Show us your internet bill.
[03:17.01]Yeah, I don't know what it is, man.
[03:18.61]Like, the last couple, the last, like, three days, the snowstorm was, like, a huge pain in the ass.
[03:23.52]My internet, like, dying on Tuesday was, like, really obnoxious and really annoying.
[03:28.70]Um, a couple other small things going on that, like, I just, I just can't, I don't know.
[03:34.53]I'm not, like, I'm not locked in right now, man.
[03:37.91]I don't want to phone in streams.
[03:41.53]So, hopefully you understand.
[03:44.01]Uh,
[03:45.80]Let me move this again and let's get the chat over here too.
[03:48.78]Let's just put the chat here.
[03:56.74]Oh, by the way, the, like, okay.
[03:58.44]Those hands, the hands thing.
[04:00.91]Did I ever tell you this?
[04:01.67]That I always thought the longest time, I didn't think it was this.
[04:04.93]I thought it was prayer hands.
[04:07.11]So when it left for instance, like, uh,
[04:10.37]Like, don't delay Smash Brothers.
[04:12.54]Instead of it like, don't delay Smash Brothers.
[04:15.32]That's like what it means, right?
[04:16.36]I thought it was like, don't do this.
[04:18.04]Don't delay Smash Brothers.
[04:20.88]I didn't think it was a clap.
[04:21.66]I thought it was prayer hands.
[04:26.56]Like, let me say something.
[04:30.47]Somebody put something in the chat.
[04:34.89]See?
[04:35.09]See?
[04:37.78]Could it be both?
[04:38.32]I mean, it could be both, but I didn't know it was clapping.
[04:43.15]Because one prayer hand is like a prayer, but when you put like three or four in between words, it becomes like, Jesus, save me!
[04:51.29]You know what I mean?
[04:51.71]Like you're moving your hands around.
[04:59.32]Who cares?
[05:01.04]I guess that's also a good stance, too.
[05:02.70]Who even gives a shit?
[05:04.52]I'm going to change this to IRL.
[05:15.74]Like, please play Roblox.
[05:18.64]Why would I play Roblox?
[05:22.06]Does anybody still play Roblox?
[05:23.48]I feel like Roblox is like RuneScape.
[05:25.52]And here's the weird thing about RuneScape.
[05:27.44]RuneScape was a huge deal when I was like 14.
[05:33.04]We're talking like more than like 15 years ago.
[05:37.52]People were playing RuneScape and people still play it.
[05:42.99]That surprises the absolute hell out of me.
[05:46.37]The RuneScape.
[05:48.47]It's a big deal.
[05:49.35]People still play it all the time.
[05:50.71]Like Roblox, I feel like is one of those things that's been around for like 10, 15 years.
[05:53.96]And it's like, oh, Roblox.
[05:58.54]Haven't heard that name in a decade.
[06:02.58]But I remember RuneScape.
[06:05.16]Is it still fun?
[06:06.52]Is it still like worth actually playing?
[06:08.35]I have not even looked at it in 10 plus years.
[06:14.34]A lot of people still play Roblox.
[06:18.24]That's crazy.
[06:19.28]That's like crazy to me.
[06:20.34]I just never would have ever imagined that people would still be playing it.
[06:23.86]I guess you could say the same thing about World of Warcraft too.
[06:26.72]But doesn't like RuneScape get significant updates all the time?
[06:30.75]Like Warcraft gets like large expansions like once every two years.
[06:36.43]It never was a good game.
[06:37.39]I never got into RuneScape.
[06:38.31]It was like, I just remember it being a thing.
[06:42.52]By the way, if you wanted to watch a video game stream tonight, I'm sorry.
[06:45.24]That's just not going to happen.
[06:49.98]I'm very floaty up here today and yesterday.
[06:56.20]I'm carrying over anger.
[06:57.96]That's the problem.
[06:59.74]I'm carrying over the fact that I was so pissed off yesterday, like the stream, like I couldn't even turn it on.
[07:06.45]And on Tuesday, having to end after like an hour and 20 minutes of like a terrible fucking stream that was at like 30 FPS from like just bad internet.
[07:14.50]Carried over into today.
[07:16.70]And it's going to take me like a day or two to shake it.
[07:18.74]I'm one of those people, I don't know, you guys can chime in if you want to.
[07:23.75]It takes me like a week to get over something.
[07:28.01]It takes me like a fucking week before I can even get over it.
[07:29.87]I can't get over it.
[07:32.39]Bad energies, bad mojo, right?
[07:34.85]Exactly.
[07:40.82]I'm kind of like that.
[07:44.74]You need to take the brain fluid to get over it.
[07:49.26]I usually get over it in a day.
[07:50.34]It takes me like three to five business days.
[07:52.90]Because the weekends don't count because you're not even focusing on any of those things.
[07:55.98]You're like enjoying these things.
[07:57.18]You're going out.
[07:57.80]Maybe you're going out with your friends.
[08:00.39]You're doing weekend things.
[08:03.29]Three to five business days.
[08:04.51]That's how long it takes me.
[08:10.88]Yeah, because I'm not open on the weekends.
[08:17.49]You must be really fat if it takes you that long.
[08:21.91]Just get over it with Bennett Foddy.
[08:23.61]No, I don't have the brain capacity to play any game that requires my thought process to go forward.
[08:30.04]I'm fucking sorry.
[08:31.06]I really am.
[08:32.42]Let me be like truly honest with you guys.
[08:35.78]So I stream like three times a week, right?
[08:41.56]there hasn't been like a real stream this week and it sincerely pisses me off and like obviously I don't want to waste your guys time and like when I feel like I'm doing that it angers me and I get fucking annoyed by it like it just annoys me and it's not a big deal I know it's fine it doesn't matter but it pisses me off
[09:12.99]When we need to have five streams per week.
[09:15.49]If you think I don't have the mental capacity for three.
[09:23.31]What is this wasted time?
[09:24.49]You've wasted my time since 2012.
[09:27.68]So you're fine.
[09:29.76]Damn.
[09:33.80]Stardew Valley is a comfy game.
[09:34.94]Stardew Valley is a great game.
[09:36.94]Highly recommend you play it.
[09:38.14]Absolutely.
[09:47.47]The way you've been wasting my time.
[09:52.50]But that's the kind of dude I am, right?
[09:55.82]You know what?
[09:59.08]Let's get it all on the table, right?
[10:00.56]I'm going to put it all on the table, by the way.
[10:03.14]Excuse me.
[10:04.48]Excuse me.
[10:06.36]You talking about the best Christmas glasses ever?
[10:09.38]This is like Doc's and Christmas sweaters.
[10:12.71]Here we go.
[10:13.49]Here we are.
[10:18.21]I can't fake streams.
[10:21.90]I can't fake happiness and pretend things are fun.
[10:25.70]I can't do it.
[10:26.84]I'm not wired that way.
[10:30.18]So I kind of refuse to just stream just because.
[10:36.89]Just to do it.
[10:39.31]um I can't do it I physically can't and and as it might like sound um wirehead that might sound like that might sound like a little pretentious if I sit back and look at it like like objectively like I'm not gonna force myself I'm gonna do when I'm ready and it's like okay
[11:05.98]Ready for what?
[11:06.58]Like, what are you getting ready for?
[11:07.64]I guess in the grand scheme of things, but... I, um... Sometimes I just don't have it.
[11:17.69]And when I don't have it, I can't.
[11:20.39]And that's as real as I can make it, really, to be completely honest.
[11:26.86]Display your... By interpretive dance, display your feelings.
[11:36.07]If you can't handle me at my worst, obey your thirst.
[11:39.09]That's correct.
[11:42.48]Should I stream Breath of the Wild?
[11:45.70]But I also... That's another thing, too.
[11:48.58]More, I guess, grand scheme of things in quotes.
[11:53.58]I don't just want to... I don't just want to play a video game on stream.
[12:00.76]Is that weird to say on twitch.tv?
[12:03.07]That might be weird to say.
[12:05.56]But I feel like just playing like a video game, just like, oh, I'm going to sit back and relax and play 12 hours of Breath of the Wild every day on stream.
[12:17.98]I don't know if I could do that.
[12:20.91]Is that like weird to say on a platform that's twitch.tv?
[12:24.49]I feel like that's a very strange thing to say.
[12:30.99]You are the chosen one.
[12:35.86]I almost feel like... I don't know.
[12:40.39]My nails are long!
[12:41.57]Holy shit!
[12:43.39]That was a little too long for my liking.
[12:49.62]I think what I want to do in 2018... This is real.
[12:58.17]There are a lot of great games that I want to play.
[13:01.10]But there are a lot of almost like live TV show type shit that I want to do as well in 2018.
[13:09.71]I have at least like two or three ideas that I want to do on a live platform that play through live more so than I want to like play a game in 2018.
[13:18.02]You know what I'm saying?
[13:24.26]That'd be really cool.
[13:29.80]New Year's resolution?
[13:30.56]Well, not necessarily New Year's resolution as much as a plan for the channel.
[13:35.12]Because more than I think about it, I have a lot of plans for videos, and I have a lot of plans for streams.
[13:44.74]Why not just combine the two of them?
[13:48.34]That makes sense, right?
[13:50.76]What if you guys could watch, like live, a live video, essentially,
[13:58.58]That was still live, but at the same amount of effort and money and time went into making it, but it was just live instead.
[14:08.50]Like a TV show.
[14:09.08]I don't know.
[14:12.60]Sometimes I think about that and I'm trying to gauge if that's a good idea for 2018.
[14:20.65]Is it live?
[14:21.09]Yeah, it would be live.
[14:23.25]Some portions might be put in, but it would be a live segment, it'd be a live show.
[14:30.17]TV isn't live, though.
[14:31.25]But I mean, like, obviously I'd be broadcasting whatever it was on Twitch.
[14:42.32]Do a Jerma Rumble where you get to vote who dies.
[14:45.27]That would be pretty brutal.
[14:52.57]Is this live?
[14:54.51]I hope so.
[14:59.20]But combining the two platforms, I think, makes sense.
[15:02.24]And... Because I've moved exclusively, pretty much.
[15:09.60]I mean, look.
[15:11.24]There are... There are like three or four videos that I have written out, and they're done.
[15:19.97]And they just need to be filmed.
[15:22.15]Two of which are going to be crazy.
[15:24.17]And I can't wait...
[15:26.18]Until they're actually truly like the set is built.
[15:30.08]But then I'm thinking about it.
[15:31.00]I'm like, damn, wouldn't that also be fucking awesome if it were live?
[15:36.46]Actually broadcasted live.
[15:42.40]In the name of the Republic and the Senate, you are under arrest.
[15:48.18]When I got that YouTube Red show coming up.
[15:50.12]But no, but interaction is like so much fun.
[15:51.50]Like.
[15:53.46]I love being able to see real-time reactions and being able to potentially even change something on the fly while it's happening in the middle of it, right?
[16:08.23]I can promise you this.
[16:08.99]I promise you that there will be at least a few occasions in 2018 where you will see that happen.
[16:14.90]You're going to see that.
[16:21.63]I gotta get a Vive.
[16:22.39]No, don't worry.
[16:23.11]Hey, Vive streams are also coming too.
[16:25.47]Dreamcast.
[16:27.17]I got a lot of work to do in those regards.
[16:34.34]Test the waters with a small project before you bring one of your bigger planned ones.
[16:37.00]Yeah, that's the idea.
[16:37.82]There's one coming up soon.
[16:41.64]That should be just strange.
[16:46.64]I hope it is.
[16:47.44]I hope it's the weirdest fucking thing you've ever seen.
[16:51.24]Yeah, we're going to do a shitload of Dreamcast.
[16:52.60]We're going to do a bunch of Vibe.
[16:54.90]And I'm going to be so late to the party with Vibe, by the way.
[16:58.85]I'm going to be so late.
[17:00.57]All these things that you thought were hilarious when you saw some streamer do it two years ago on a Vibe, I can't wait to be running behind the wagon two years late to this stuff.
[17:17.20]I've seen a lot of this, and I'm going to give you an official response right now.
[17:23.72]Everybody wants me to play VRChat.
[17:27.30]But I don't know if I'm going to.
[17:30.21]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[17:31.45]And I'll tell you the one reason why I might not do it.
[17:35.51]Because VRChat right now is like... is...
[17:43.22]The PUBG of Twitch.
[17:45.62]Now.
[17:46.10]You know what I mean?
[17:46.94]That's like the get on it and do it and it's fucking hilarious thing to do right now.
[17:53.79]There's nothing wrong with that.
[17:55.07]I don't think there's anything wrong with doing it.
[17:56.17]Obviously, if something's interesting and popular and funny, it's going to be worth watching, but... It's like the new... And yeah, you can call me a hipster dickhead if you want.
[18:08.28]Do it.
[18:09.44]I mean, I'm not, but...
[18:11.56]That is what somebody that would be classified as a hipster turd would say.
[18:19.99]It's the PUBG of the PUBG of Twitch right now.
[18:25.59]Maybe I would do that, but I would think I would want to lock it down to like a few.
[18:29.59]Can you do like a private room with VRChat?
[18:33.03]I'd want to play Monopoly as like the cast of Seinfeld or something.
[18:39.27]I don't know.
[18:39.58]That'd be like stupid.
[18:45.24]Lots of people don't have a VR, though.
[18:46.62]Well, no, look, I perfectly understand why people think it's awesome and think it's funny.
[18:50.80]I think it's fucking funny and awesome, too.
[18:53.18]I've watched a dozen clips at this point of VRChat nonsense that I think have been hilarious.
[18:59.71]But... I just...
[19:04.29]That's one of those boats that you kind of have to be on when it's sailing.
[19:07.51]Otherwise, you're kind of just chasing with a life raft and an oar.
[19:11.37]Hold on, wait, let me, well, that can be funny too.
[19:13.90]Let me be funny as well.
[19:14.76]Hold on, let me put the mask on and like say swears.
[19:17.08]Like, I already do that anyways.
[19:26.25]But I do see its value.
[19:28.71]I do.
[19:29.13]I think that shit's fucking hilarious.
[19:31.73]I just don't want to be chasing with a life raft.
[19:34.09]You know what I mean?
[19:38.35]But you don't, but you don't say swears.
[19:40.29]You know, that's right.
[19:40.93]I don't.
[19:42.15]Ever.
[19:43.01]Ever.
[19:43.69]In my entire life.
[19:49.00]Just buy a boat and appear.
[19:50.34]I will, you know what I wanted to do?
[19:53.14]And this is one of those like live TV type segments.
[19:57.66]I want, I don't know.
[19:58.30]I wanted to be like out in like a raft.
[20:01.72]and just go off this scripted tangent about how this is a new thing, I'm making a new show called Lost on the Raft, and there's four people on it.
[20:14.23]No, give no context, just tell you, just do it.
[20:17.71]Lost on the Raft, and there's three ham and cheese sandwiches.
[20:21.31]That's it.
[20:25.69]It would be fake, everything would be fake, it'd be all made up and shit like that.
[20:28.97]I'm not talking about the actual content on the raft.
[20:32.45]Talking about like the beginning and like the intro to like Lost on the... Show like all the other people that have been on the show before.
[20:37.81]Eat each other to survive.
[20:50.02]But I think at least in the long term, a platform like this, like twitch.tv, is gonna see more stuff like that eventually.
[20:59.48]I think so.
[21:01.41]Because everybody treats Twitch like the new TV.
[21:05.59]Nobody like buys cable anymore.
[21:07.27]I don't have cable.
[21:09.26]I have an Apple TV and I watch Twitch.
[21:13.08]It's like if somebody's streaming, if I want to watch like, like one of my favorite things every year is like the HDQ and SGDQ, right?
[21:23.08]I watch those more than I watch TV shows.
[21:25.96]It's, I love it so much.
[21:27.44]And it's live and it's there.
[21:28.70]Here it is.
[21:29.40]This is when it's happening.
[21:30.65]And this is live.
[21:31.51]And this is the show you're about to watch.
[21:34.83]I don't have a cable.
[21:35.43]I don't have a cable subscription at all.
[21:42.51]This is the new platform for like television is streamed, broadcasted content that is like a, everyone has their own channel.
[21:54.56]January 7th is SGDQ.
[21:56.68]Yeah, it's gonna be great.
[22:02.30]So, but think of like things like SGDQ and that's just strictly like video games at this point, right?
[22:09.94]But as like Twitch community people, like as like viewers, watchers, streamers, whatever you, however you wanna call us, that's like our Oscars week.
[22:20.92]You know what I mean?
[22:21.84]Like, well, no, that's not Oscars week.
[22:24.15]That's like our Shark Week, right?
[22:26.95]Anybody that watches television will tell you, oh man, oh, Discovery Shark Week's coming up.
[22:31.61]I can't wait.
[22:32.17]It's the best.
[22:32.71]It's so great.
[22:33.71]You just sit there and you watch the sharks fucking eat people and eat each other.
[22:37.01]It's like, that's great.
[22:37.61]This is our Shark Week.
[22:44.22]This is the Oscars.
[22:45.48]Everybody does this.
[22:46.20]Everybody watches the same thing at the same time.
[22:49.94]Like the Olympics, exactly.
[22:50.98]This is like the Olympics.
[22:52.76]That's a perfect way to describe it.
[23:00.84]That's a TV show.
[23:02.74]Yeah.
[23:05.70]Can't wait to watch we eat the egg live on the boat.
[23:12.25]But this will be our little 2018 spreadsheet stream.
[23:20.08]Gonna do some, I'm gonna do some experiments with this live platform.
[23:26.79]You'll see, you know, not gonna happen tomorrow.
[23:28.85]Like, not gonna happen on fucking Tuesday.
[23:30.83]Not gonna happen on Wednesday.
[23:31.75]Ain't gonna happen on Thursday.
[23:33.09]It's gonna happen on... Throw a dart.
[23:37.65]Throw a dart in spring, and then you'll find it.
[23:43.44]But you'll see a lot less... In quotation marks...
[23:49.91]2018, you're going to see a lot less strictly video game streams on this channel.
[23:58.40]Not social experiments.
[24:00.14]I'm not going to do that.
[24:01.14]Dumb.
[24:02.02]Don't say dumb.
[24:02.80]It's pretty dumb.
[24:07.56]Somebody might like that.
[24:08.26]That's alright.
[24:08.76]Look, you don't have to fuck the cable companies.
[24:10.60]You got your own Apple TV.
[24:11.54]You got your own TV shows.
[24:12.52]You got your own network.
[24:25.05]I'll make a prank show too.
[24:28.62]I'm going to make a prank show.
[24:30.14]It's just going to be me walking down the street accidentally spilling shit on myself.
[24:37.10]You know what I mean?
[24:38.38]And I'll say to the person next to me, like, got ya.
[24:40.25]Like, pranked ya.
[24:41.75]Got ya.
[24:43.21]You know, like, I'll be walking out with like a coffee in my hands and you think, oh, I'm going to spill it on them.
[24:47.31]No, spill it on me.
[24:48.95]Oh, got ya.
[24:51.48]You know, wait, uh, wait, like till somebody comes around with like a dog.
[24:56.76]Right.
[24:57.08]And then like the dog walks by and you walk by and you're like, Hey, nice dog.
[25:00.88]Your dog's so cute.
[25:02.42]Got ya.
[25:03.72]And like, I turned to the camera and say that.
[25:07.22]What a twist.
[25:12.14]You know what?
[25:13.36]This is never going to be a... Let's talk about this.
[25:16.54]But I'm going to make sure that I... No, this might be a video.
[25:20.38]This could be one of the things I'm talking about.
[25:23.46]But I feel like it's so far down the road that you guys are just going to forget anyways.
[25:28.50]Alright, so... Should I just spoil this whole thing?
[25:34.79]I think I'm going to spoil this whole thing.
[25:40.49]I'm going to do it.
[25:40.97]Who cares?
[25:42.03]It's one of like a dozen things.
[25:45.44]So you guys know like those hidden camera shows, right?
[25:49.46]Where they... No, no, no.
[25:52.12]Wow, I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[25:55.80]Wow.
[25:57.79]Okay.
[25:58.49]Alright.
[25:58.91]Alright.
[25:59.49]Okay.
[26:00.25]Alright.
[26:00.75]Okay.
[26:01.41]Alright.
[26:02.91]I will absolve from doing that.
[26:08.25]Don't you do it.
[26:08.93]Okay.
[26:09.77]I won't.
[26:12.29]Spoiler free.
[26:14.71]And even though you know the word hidden camera, it's not, there's nothing to do with what I was about to say.
[26:20.34]That's a 2020 joke.
[26:22.48]Yes.
[26:26.48]We want to be surprised.
[26:27.54]Okay.
[26:32.07]Ruined.
[26:32.73]Ruined.
[26:33.29]No, it's not that big of a deal.
[26:36.05]But just... 2018. 2018.
[26:40.65]is the year of starting to transition to more of the produced content.
[27:00.45]By when I say produced, I mean
[27:03.72]Regardless if it's on Twitch or not.
[27:05.34]Regardless if it has anything to do with a video game.
[27:09.23]More of that kind of stuff.
[27:15.17]Yeah.
[27:16.57]It's a year of the transition from strictly video games to a lot more of other shit.
[27:24.78]So.
[27:29.78]Yeah.
[27:30.50]The year of the bison.
[27:36.43]Knocks on beer.
[27:37.95]I got a beer here?
[27:38.55]Where's my beer?
[27:43.69]But we like video games.
[27:45.55]So do I. But.
[27:48.63]But.
[27:49.84]But.
[27:51.26]I think at this stage in my life, I would like to try to focus more on...
[28:01.76]some of the streams that you've watched in the last month or so.
[28:08.75]I want to do more of that.
[28:10.31]I want, because that's where I have the most enjoyment.
[28:15.02]That's where I have the most fun.
[28:19.86]I have way more fun doing stuff that isn't necessarily video games than playing video games.
[28:29.73]That's just the truth.
[28:30.39]That's just the straight up truth.
[28:33.54]and that doesn't mean like for instance like the like WWE right like that's a video game but I feel like that's not that's not like playing a video game you know I'm saying that's an entire like world that we've created here on this channel video games in 2018 wow you're really doing it wrong
[28:59.91]But I think, look, I don't want to scare anybody that's like, oh, wait, Jeremy's not doing video games anymore.
[29:07.22]He's gone.
[29:08.02]He's taken off.
[29:08.94]See you later.
[29:09.56]No more video game streams.
[29:12.36]No, I just want to focus on, even if they are video game streams, I want to focus on them being not just playing a video game streams.
[29:25.15]Does that make sense?
[29:27.67]I hope so.
[29:30.05]I hope that makes sense.
[29:36.49]I have to start streaming on creative.
[29:38.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[29:40.71]I can't hang.
[29:42.03]You want me to stream on creative?
[29:44.39]I'll be run out in fucking two weeks.
[29:55.58]The story of how I killed video games.
[29:59.03]Yeah, come back to this video because video games are done.
[30:02.57]They're over.
[30:03.23]They were a fad.
[30:05.27]Mark my words.
[30:06.31]Video games were a fad.
[30:07.49]It was like a 39-year-old fad.
[30:12.38]Video games are over.
[30:18.92]I say all these things, but you also have to remember...
[30:22.75]I'm going to be huge into Monster Hunter: World.
[30:25.45]There's that prison escape game, that co-op prison game.
[30:28.43]I cannot wait to play that.
[30:30.79]There's like four or five games that are coming out this year that I am so excited for.
[30:39.38]But just know that I want to do more of those kind of streams.
[30:43.92]And even if that means turning this channel into more of a
[30:50.13]You know, half of it is like a TV show and the other half isn't.
[30:53.41]If that makes any sense.
[30:57.57]The Prison Game by Tommy Wiseau.
[31:05.12]He's gonna next all of his favorite video games.
[31:07.66]Yeah, and after this week.
[31:14.62]Why do you look so emo?
[31:16.68]Do I?
[31:16.94]Let me fucking fix that.
[31:18.95]Do I?
[31:19.17]Is it the hair?
[31:19.75]Does the hair make me look like emo?
[31:22.55]It's because I haven't had a cut.
[31:23.91]It just sits there like this.
[31:27.57]I need like better posture.
[31:29.09]Am I emotional now?
[31:31.27]No.
[31:31.77]There we go.
[31:32.79]If you're an emotional, you don't have this kind of posture, I don't think.
[31:36.78]No, you don't.
[31:38.44]You find me one emotional that like has, you know, sits like this shit.
[31:43.00]You know what I mean?
[31:45.50]Does the hair make me look even?
[31:48.22]Anyways.
[31:50.88]So, I think sit like that for two hours.
[31:55.52]Nah, fuck that.
[31:57.14]I don't think I'm gonna do that.
[32:03.63]I would classify myself as a disciplined emotional.
[32:09.03]That's perfect.
[32:10.41]I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[32:12.75]I talk a lot of shit.
[32:13.81]I fly off the handle.
[32:14.75]I get angry, but I'm disciplined about it.
[32:17.59]I speak very, very clearly and fluently and intelligently.
[32:21.29]I'm a disciplined emotional.
[32:22.23]You know, it's like, that's like, that's a new scale.
[32:25.55]That's a new scale.
[32:26.63]So we've got, put that somewhere on the alignment scale.
[32:31.33]We got, we got lawful good.
[32:34.66]Neutral good.
[32:37.12]Chaotic good.
[32:40.08]Neutral.
[32:40.92]True neutral.
[32:43.65]Disciplined emotional.
[32:46.73]Chaotic neutral.
[32:48.71]Down the lower left, we got... Chef.
[32:53.70]In the middle.
[32:54.90]Bottom middle.
[32:56.78]The Joker.
[32:57.92]And then all the way at the bottom down right, we've got... A ball of yarn.
[33:06.27]There you go.
[33:06.63]There's your new alignment chart.
[33:10.07]A ball of yarn with a knife, with a bloody knife in his hand.
[33:13.20]Because you could just get unraveled and fucking stabbed.
[33:15.68]You know what I mean?
[33:16.68]That's true chaotic evil.
[33:19.46]You put a knife in a ball of yarn's hand and let it go.
[33:21.74]Holy shit, you better get out of the way.
[33:33.95]D&D 6th edition.
[33:35.97]That's the one.
[33:40.75]How can anyone but the Joker be the Joker alignment?
[33:44.59]How is it possible that somebody else can be the Joker if the Joker alignment is the Joker?
[33:50.62]No, that's just who you will identify with.
[33:52.72]If you identify with the chef, then you're down here on the lower left.
[33:56.54]It's not easy.
[33:57.16]It's not hard.
[33:57.74]It's very easy.
[33:58.50]I actually look like I could be Aquaman.
[34:04.71]Alright, guys, I'm going to give you a confession here.
[34:12.65]I don't know what Aquaman does.
[34:16.25]Aquaman is like Dr. Dolittle, but holding his breath, right?
[34:21.51]He's the underwater Dr. Dolittle.
[34:23.80]That's all he does, right?
[34:26.86]He doesn't do anything else.
[34:28.58]He can talk to animals.
[34:33.56]That's it.
[34:34.93]Does he do anything else?
[34:37.51]He can swim.
[34:38.77]I can swim.
[34:41.58]He swims very fast.
[34:43.93]So?
[34:48.01]Aquaman beat up Superman underwater.
[34:49.77]But that's just because they wanted to, like, at least sell a couple of comic books.
[34:52.91]You can't... Alright, if you're gonna have a character that can't do shit, and you're gonna put him against Superman, everybody loves Superman, you have to give that character at least...
[35:04.07]At least one or two issues where he does something cool so you get to sell the toys and you get to sell the shirts.
[35:09.28]I mean, I saw that episode.
[35:10.92]You're like, oh, right in Superman's jaw.
[35:13.16]That's why I got this.
[35:14.34]I was like, I need an Aquaman shirt.
[35:16.72]And I love fish.
[35:18.68]Especially eating them.
[35:23.71]That was bad.
[35:24.19]That was mean.
[35:24.85]I'm sorry.
[35:25.77]It's true.
[35:26.21]It is.
[35:26.47]It's true.
[35:27.43]It's true.
[35:28.01]It's my favorite fucking food.
[35:34.53]I love eating fish.
[35:36.31]I am Aquaman.
[35:37.81]So let me get this straight.
[35:39.35]So I love Aquaman.
[35:41.87]I love animals.
[35:43.75]Aquaman loves animals.
[35:46.34]He's a fish.
[35:48.64]I eat a lot of fish.
[35:50.06]So he eats fish.
[35:51.84]He eats animals.
[35:53.66]He loves animals.
[35:55.76]And he can swim real fast.
[35:57.32]I can do that.
[35:58.51]Have you guys ever seen me in a pool?
[36:00.71]You know?
[36:02.57]Like this?
[36:04.43]Like that, right?
[36:05.08]That's how you do it.
[36:06.60]It's funny.
[36:06.92]Cause like, I only know how to go like this.
[36:10.26]You think that's a joke?
[36:11.38]I don't know how to swim.
[36:12.20]I don't know.
[36:12.78]How does, let me look, let's talk about this.
[36:14.72]This is really important.
[36:15.88]I swear to God, I've been thinking about this for fucking years.
[36:18.05]I forgot about it forever.
[36:19.53]Now I want to bring it up on stream.
[36:21.27]Explain to me how to swim.
[36:26.87]How do you swim?
[36:28.41]How does this make you go faster?
[36:32.32]Isn't that extra unnecessary effort?
[36:34.28]Wouldn't you want to be like, you know what I mean?
[36:37.02]Like a fucking octopus?
[36:39.70]Why would you raise your hand this high over like this?
[36:43.40]That doesn't make any sense to me.
[36:46.34]Like the doggy paddle is, to me, is a lot more efficient.
[36:51.90]It just does.
[36:54.10]Wouldn't you want to like go up and in like this wicked quick like a chicken?
[37:00.87]It displaces more water.
[37:02.02]Alright, you wanna talk about water displacement?
[37:04.52]Put your hands like this, and do a turkey backwards.
[37:07.40]Elbows like cats sit.
[37:08.60]And you tell me if you could displace more water.
[37:18.17]Take that Aquaman shirt.
[37:19.55]No!
[37:20.83]The Aquaman shirt stays on.
[37:23.52]Take that Aquaman shirt off.
[37:25.80]Yeah, guess what, guys?
[37:27.06]Your favorite fucking cartoon character, Aquaman, he don't go like this.
[37:32.26]He has a fucking mermaid tail and he wiggles like a dolphin.

[37:39.90]Let's go ahead and watch the Aquaman trailer and let's see who was correct.

[39:00.20]Everybody said, oh, no, you're an idiot for saying that.
[39:02.56]You're dumb.
[39:03.66]That's not how the swimming is.
[39:05.66]Let's watch the best swimmer in the universe.
[39:07.64]See how he does it.
[39:20.58]There is a stranger who comes to this village from the sea.
[39:25.84]He comes in the winter when people are hungry.
[39:27.66]Yeah.
[39:28.12]Brings fish.
[39:29.41]Comes on the king tide.
[39:30.61]That was last night.
[39:39.01]There he is.
[39:39.39]Alright, let's see it.
[39:48.33]Mm-hmm.

[39:57.97]Come on.
[40:01.82]Aquaman.

[40:05.74]What trailer is this?
[40:06.78]This is Aquaman, right?
[40:09.40]Or a lot.
[40:20.75]This is like, I feel like he's like a side character in his own movie.
[40:28.21]When does he go in the water?
[40:29.35]When does he talk to the fish?
[40:42.46]No, this is Aquaman.
[40:43.54]I clicked on the Aquaman.
[40:44.76]This is not Justice League.
[40:46.00]This is the Aquaman trailer.
[40:54.77]What the hell am I watching?
[40:55.71]Hold on.
[41:01.81]Oh, shit.
[41:10.61]Why did that play?
[41:11.57]I clicked on Aquaman.
[41:14.37]Justice League Aquaman.
[41:15.97]Oh, fucking God damn it.
[41:17.47]Wait, is there an Aquaman movie?
[41:19.77]There's an Aquaman movie.

[41:28.12]Justice League Aquaman trailer.
[41:34.73]Wait, there's no Aquaman movie?

[41:55.06]Here we go.
[41:59.97]Already done.
[42:01.61]Got it.
[42:08.76]Check it out.
[42:15.62]See?

[42:40.34]See?
[42:40.48]Two different worlds.
[42:41.22]He's half man, half fish.
[42:41.76]Look at them swimming.
[42:45.85]Do you see his hand?
[42:51.93]Oh, come on.
[43:06.76]When he finds his place at the Justice League, that's when he can really put his skills to use.
[43:11.00]I have to start my fire scan.
[43:12.78]One of my favorite things to film is when I jumped on the Batmobile.
[43:20.10]It was badass.
[43:20.96]No, that was badass.
[43:22.25]Let's see.
[43:22.69]He doesn't have those powers.
[43:26.27]I was like, I cannot believe I'm surfing the Batmobile right now.
[43:31.61]We'll do this together.
[43:40.04]Clearly in that trailer Aquaman did not swim like Michael Phelps Let's see anybody like footage we have here of like Aquaman swimming This is like the 60s cartoon he used to walk around I
[44:06.89]King of the Seven Seas.
[44:11.90]Let's watch this because this will show you guys exactly what I'm talking about.
[44:15.72]We can watch this one too.

[45:07.17]What else we got going on?
[45:09.39]I don't even know what we were talking about.
[45:10.47]I forget everything, so.
[45:14.99]Just glide.
[45:15.63]No, just go.
[45:16.29]Just shake your body around and have your feet go like this.
[45:24.74]You were right.
[45:25.34]This is weirder than VRChat.
[45:32.76]VRChat can't handle me.
[45:35.74]I'm the weirdest of them all.
[45:39.38]No, we already did this on Tuesday.
[45:40.82]I'm not doing it again.
[45:42.84]I ain't gonna do this again.
[45:43.85]I did like a... If those of you guys weren't here for the stream into the restream, into Etalyx' stream, I was getting weird in Etalyx' stream.
[45:52.17]Yeah, I ain't gonna go down that road again.
[45:56.97]Not today.
[45:57.35]I'm not in that mood.
[45:57.91]I'm in like an annoyed mood right now.
[45:59.33]Not like a weird mood.
[46:02.88]Somebody... He's texting me.
[46:07.15]That stream was great.
[46:08.27]Well, it was fun.
[46:14.13]Nothing personal.
[46:17.97]Play VRChat annoyed.
[46:20.61]No.
[46:21.75]BRB watching VOD?
[46:22.73]You don't want to do that.
[46:24.23]You don't want to do that.
[46:25.57]This is not a stream that you want to watch the whole VOD for.
[46:29.47]I would start when the IRL portion began, is what I would say.
[46:34.62]That's what we're going to tell you to do.
[46:41.08]Your hair looks like it's trying to escape your head.
[46:47.29]One of these days, I swear to God, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go like this.
[46:51.21]It's gonna be... It's been a wig the whole time.
[46:54.63]The whole time.
[46:55.11]It's just been like a sick of sick of toupee sitting on my head.
[46:59.45]You know, I'm gonna turn it upside down and it's gonna be a dead bird.
[47:02.97]You guys have no idea.
[47:04.27]It's a dead bird.
[47:05.65]This isn't hair.
[47:06.33]Just wait till the fucking reveal.
[47:13.93]Anyways.
[47:18.01]So, what we're going to do now is we're going to go through the bits.
[47:28.40]The bits.
[47:31.44]And we are going to start fresh on Tuesday.
[47:41.83]Tuesday is going to be a fresh start.
[47:44.82]There are a couple things I want to do on Tuesday, and I gotta shake off this annoyed attitude that I've had the last two days.
[47:53.05]Sorry.
[47:54.03]Sorry I've been a little annoying boy.
[47:56.03]I wore Dead Bird for two levels.
[48:02.06]My hair is actually supposed to be like this.
[48:05.74]No, that's... Hold on.
[48:10.24]It's supposed to be... I was really going for a real Aquaman here.
[48:13.61]It's supposed to be like this, like tied back in like a big, long ponytail back here.
[48:19.94]Like, who's the actor that plays Aquaman?
[48:23.02]Jason Sudeikis?
[48:24.62]No, what's his name?
[48:25.92]Something like that.
[48:30.73]So, let's do the bits.
[48:33.49]There's a lot of them.
[48:34.49]Let's go through them fairly quickly so I can...
[48:42.01]Go refresh myself and come back strong.
[48:47.61]Even stronger than I am now.
[48:49.19]And I'm not that strong.
[48:56.58]50 bucks.
[48:57.68]We'll start there.
[48:58.50]We'll start at $50.
[48:59.16]I guess that's where we're going to start.
[49:02.22]Holy shnikes.
[49:05.66]Thank you.
[49:07.73]to 510 QB pits for the $50.
[49:11.63]They say Bazinga.
[49:12.73]That's one of my favorite TV shows of all time is the Big Bang Theory.
[49:17.40]And they say Bazinga in that show.
[49:20.56]I love Sheldon.
[49:21.84]I love when he stands up like this and says a couple of words and the audience laughs.
[49:25.92]It's one of my favorite shows.
[49:30.83]Yeah, I lied.
[49:31.73]I'm a big fan.
[49:32.73]I actually got to stop saying that because there might be some new people in here.
[49:37.06]arguably there could be like new people every single day.
[49:40.17]And I really don't want anyone to think that I actually like the Big Bang Theory.
[49:44.29]So remember that's a joke.
[49:45.17]I don't, that's just terrible.
[49:48.87]Sorry.
[49:49.86]Some of you people might be actually pretty new.
[49:52.54]But thank you 510cubepits for the 50 bucks donation.
[49:56.37]It's a great show.
[49:57.05]It's one of my favorites.
[49:59.22]I love it.
[49:59.92]Anyways, thank you to Fourth Consecutive Lion for the $10.
[50:03.16]Yo, Merry New Year.
[50:04.38]Looking so forward to 2018 and all its content.

[50:18.43]My room is a fucking...
[50:20.67]Mess.
[50:21.23]Who cares?
[50:22.87]But thank you, Fuzzy, for the $10.
[50:24.73]Also, thank you to Molotov Bartender for the bits.
[50:27.39]Zeno Fields for the $5.

[50:38.36]OneEyed... Thank you, OneEyed, for the $1.
[50:41.33]Play TF2 or unsub.

[50:48.58]Thanks for the $1.
[50:48.96]Sorry.
[50:49.14]Can I get it on my phone?
[50:50.30]Can you get TF2 on your phone?
[50:51.22]Here.
[50:54.04]Oh, here you go.
[50:56.83]TF2 on phone.
[51:16.83]Really?
[51:17.71]Download now.
[51:20.29]Interesting.
[51:25.45]Whoa.
[51:27.19]This is insane.
[51:32.33]Whoa, they have everybody.
[51:33.21]They have the scout.
[51:35.15]They have the heavy.
[51:39.68]Whoa, watch out.
[51:41.82]Shit.
[51:43.40]Got him.
[51:47.32]Two points.
[51:48.10]You got two points per backstab, right?
[51:53.28]Got it!
[51:54.90]I'm done with that game.
[51:56.44]That was a fun game.
[52:02.12]Yeah, the gyrosphere is in here.
[52:04.68]That's how you turn.
[52:06.49]It's like driving a car.
[52:07.35]A little different.
[52:12.19]I still remember the points.
[52:13.57]Of course I do.
[52:14.41]It's like riding a bike.
[52:15.37]You never forget it.
[52:17.44]Fix that.
[52:18.02]There we go.
[52:18.56]There we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:19.60]There we go.
[52:20.14]Okay.
[52:21.72]Thank you, though.
[52:24.88]That's my ringtone.
[52:26.93]No, it's not.
[52:28.41]My ringtone is just some shitty one that's inside the sounds folder.
[52:33.43]Thank you to Lion Son for the $5.00.
[52:37.42]Thank you to Z990 or Zero.
[52:40.86]That makes sense too.
[52:43.18]Thanks to the 150.
[52:43.70]I'm writing a D&D campaign and with you releasing a new edition of D&D.
[52:47.72]What should I add to my campaign that would make it inherently better?
[52:53.20]A cave.
[52:54.16]A cave system.
[52:56.80]And inside the cave system, a fountain in there of unknown liquid.
[53:03.68]And make sure to have at least
[53:07.70]one tavern to go to go into and have somebody sitting at the bar that's a seedy character that you can't trust but you have to trust him anyways because he has some like information for you and also um put a carnival in there too nobody does carnivals in dnd why
[53:31.85]Why does it always have to be like going in caves and going in hallways and shit?
[53:36.69]Where's the carnival?
[53:38.17]Go to a carnival.
[53:39.27]And I want to ride the rides at the carnival.
[53:41.80]And then when I'm at the top of the peak of the Ferris wheel, wow, a fucking alien meteor just crashed down and landed and here they are.
[53:50.07]What are you going to do?
[53:51.39]You're at the top.
[53:52.65]If you're at the top of a Ferris wheel, you can't get off.
[53:54.69]That happens all the time.
[53:55.83]They stop you at like 88 degrees and you're just sitting there.
[53:59.77]What are you going to do?
[54:00.35]Get out?
[54:00.93]No, you're going to watch.
[54:02.81]I'm not going to use any, I'm not, I'm not going to use move turn.
[54:05.03]I'm going to sit down.
[54:06.92]I'm gonna look down and see what they're doing down there.
[54:08.90]Do I have a bow and arrow?
[54:10.22]I'm gonna roll a d6.
[54:11.54]D6 +2.
[54:13.28]Bingo.
[54:14.71]Where were the other people?
[54:15.65]The other people that are on the team?
[54:16.93]Might have been at one of the midway games.
[54:18.43]Might have been over here sitting at the tavern.
[54:21.85]Might have sat down at the tavern that's right there and talked to the creepy guy that you still have to talk to when you use a CD character.
[54:28.87]I would do it.
[54:32.26]Big bingo.
[54:33.66]What do you mean big bingo?
[54:37.11]What does that mean?
[54:39.81]Have you ever heard of the gorillas?
[54:43.45]Yes.
[54:44.39]Yes, I have.
[54:45.74]They're like my favorite band.
[54:47.90]Have you ever heard of the gorillas?
[54:50.58]Jerma, all your jokes suck.
[54:51.84]End the stream.
[54:52.40]Okay.
[54:55.36]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[54:57.70]Appreciate it.
[55:04.71]See you later.
[55:08.18]And by the way, I don't give a fuck.
[55:18.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:19.25]Oh, hold on.
[55:20.91]Somebody didn't like my jokes.
[55:21.87]Somebody didn't like the jokes.
[55:25.43]Why don't I go ahead and turn off the stream?
[55:40.58]Yeah.
[55:44.78]You clearly don't care.
[55:47.20]What do you mean I clearly don't care?
[55:48.60]Of course I want people to think I'm funny.
[55:50.60]I want people to like me and I want them to be like, oh, that was a funny stream and I like that guy.
[55:55.20]I really like that guy.
[55:55.84]I think he's really funny.
[55:56.62]And then I lie down in line at bed and I just like, I sit there and I'm like, do people think I'm fucking, do people like me?
[56:03.22]Do I have any friends?
[56:04.62]Did the thing I did today go over well?
[56:07.67]And then tears start streaming down my fucking face and I scream out of a dead sleep.
[56:15.28]Nightmare.
[56:19.92]Anyways, thank you to, thank you to Clavman for the $5.
[56:27.85]Hey Jerem, I've been around since you first started and tonight I wanted to share a huge personal victory.
[56:34.43]Been training for the Coast Guard and I finally hit an 11 minute mile and a half.
[56:39.80]Which is the standard for hostage rescue, what I'm training for.
[56:44.58]Anyways, thanks for being a huge inspiration and influence these past years.
[56:47.52]Holy shit.
[56:50.12]Well, Clapman, you're a fucking hostage rescuer at this point.
[56:55.76]Hell yeah, dude.
[56:58.08]Thanks for sticking around.
[56:59.24]I actually have family in the Coast Guard, so that's really cool.
[57:04.33]11 minute, mile and a half.
[57:08.46]Fuck yeah, man.
[57:09.28]Nice.
[57:10.88]Thank you for sticking around.
[57:11.84]Thank you, Klabman, for the $5.
[57:13.10]Wish you the best of luck in the rest of your training if you're not done.
[57:21.14]Rescue those people.
[57:25.04]$50 just came in right now, too.
[57:26.98]It was QB pits again.
[57:28.34]510 QB pits with 50 more dollars.
[57:34.83]No joke, Jeremy, you make the best content, best streamer of all time.
[57:40.49]Thank you.
[57:41.71]Thank you so much.
[57:43.53]$50 and you're telling me that I'm like the best streamer ever?
[57:47.75]Set up for this one.
[57:50.07]Thanks a lot, man.
[57:52.33]I can show everybody the posture I'm able to possess.
[57:57.25]Ah, yes.
[57:57.81]No joke, Jeremy.
[58:00.51]No, thank you so much, dude.
[58:02.13]That means a lot.
[58:04.68]I am grateful.
[58:07.04]Absolutely grateful that people give me money and think I'm worth watching.
[58:13.28]What more could I possibly fucking ask, right?
[58:19.71]Like people giving me a bunch of fucking money and telling me that I'm like the favorite streamer.
[58:24.41]There's nothing else I could fucking possibly ask for.
[58:28.79]Thank you so much.
[58:32.59]That's really all I can say.
[58:39.09]Thank you so much.
[58:40.13]Dragonflyer, thanks for the $1.
[58:41.49]A PB&J?
[58:45.19]Yeah, a PB&J is actually pretty shitty.
[58:47.36]A lot of people eat peanut butter and jelly.
[58:49.64]Don't eat peanut butter and fluff.
[58:51.30]What are you?
[58:52.18]Some kind of non-human?
[58:54.22]Peanut butter and jelly?
[58:56.44]Peanut butter and fluff?
[58:58.16]Don't eat jelly?
[58:59.12]Peanut butter and jelly?
[59:00.50]Put jelly in a donut.
[59:01.97]Spread jelly on toast.
[59:03.53]You make a fluff another sandwich.
[59:06.07]Get out of here!
[59:09.43]You know what I'm saying?
[59:16.66]Peanut butter and jelly tastes like somebody spit in your mouth.
[59:19.06]I hate it.
[59:19.46]Alright, you bite down, you get that good peanut butter flavor, and then you get to the loogie, and you get to the loogie jelly part, and you just want to spit it out.
[59:30.82]Fluff-o-nutter.
[59:32.28]Peanut butter and fluff.
[59:33.66]You dip down into the creamy peanut butter.
[59:35.66]That's a great plus texture.
[59:37.48]And then you go up with your bottom teeth right into the bottom.
[59:40.64]The fluff is a fluffy, pillowy, sugary texture mixed with the peanut butter.
[59:45.05]Perfect.
[59:45.77]And that delicious white bread that you buy, everyone buys at the grocery store because all they can do is clear it out during a snowstorm.
[59:54.09]Yeah, you gotta get that like wonder bread.
[59:55.75]Don't, I'm just kidding.
[59:56.45]Actually, don't buy fucking that shit.
[59:58.63]Get like something else.
[60:05.60]White bread sucks.
[60:06.64]Don't buy white bread.
[60:09.00]This is a callback to our previous conversation at the beginning of the stream.
[60:14.78]Don't buy wheat.
[60:15.22]Wheat sucks too.
[60:16.20]Wheat also sucks.
[60:18.06]You want the best fucking bread?
[60:19.26]I'll give you what the best bread is.
[60:23.80]How do you spell it?
[60:28.18]There it is.
[60:29.38]Best bread you'll ever eat.
[60:31.26]Ladies and gentlemen, what do you think it is?
[60:41.36]Come on.
[60:44.00]It's a tie.
[60:47.93]Not whole wheat.
[60:48.75]No.
[60:50.13]Ciabatta.
[60:51.53]Ciabatta bread and pretzel buns.
[60:54.41]Pretzel bread, ciabatta bread, and potato bread.
[60:58.82]Don't get anything up.
[60:59.48]Potato bread, ciabatta bread, pretzel bread.
[61:06.43]Garlic sour, sourdough's alright.
[61:08.31]I would accept a sourdough sandwich.
[61:11.16]I would accept a sourdough sandwich.
[61:12.60]I wouldn't be happy about it.
[61:14.08]I'd be like, oh, sourdough?
[61:16.78]Like, this is you I'm talking to, right?
[61:19.01]You gave it to me?
[61:20.70]And you're like, oh, I made a nice sandwich for you.
[61:24.82]It's on a toasted garlic aioli sourdough with some pickles, some relish.
[61:29.93]You got a little bit of ham on there.
[61:31.11]And I actually cooked the cheese for five seconds in the pan.
[61:34.45]It took a lot of time.
[61:35.67]And I would grab it from you.
[61:36.91]Like, this is you I'm talking to, right?
[61:38.65]So here's my sandwich.
[61:40.31]And I'm like, oh, sourdough.
[61:51.86]And then you'd be like wicked uncomfortable about it.
[61:57.28]But I worked hard on that sandwich.
[62:00.39]And you'd be like, I'm going to be you.
[62:04.51]Dude, is there something wrong?
[62:09.61]Nah.
[62:14.04]Nah, it's all good, man.
[62:15.88]He fucking tried, right?
[62:21.09]It's alright.
[62:26.39]That would be so rude.
[62:30.78]Passive, yeah, just pure passive aggression.
[62:33.74]Just sitting there like, no, it's cool, man.
[62:35.78]It's good.
[62:38.06]It's wicked good.
[62:43.17]Eat the phone.
[62:43.95]Eat the phone or pre-record it.
[62:45.33]Eat the phone or pre-record it.
[62:47.11]Fine.
[62:47.37]Fine.
[62:58.62]Oh, eat the, Jerma, eat the plastic.
[63:00.38]Eat the plastic or it's pre-recorded, right?
[63:07.28]Hey, eat that cup or the stream doesn't live.
[63:18.37]You guys and your fucking memes.
[63:23.84]Someone stop him.
[63:26.78]We were reading bits.
[63:31.84]Where are the bits that we were just reading?
[63:36.46]Hold on a second.
[63:43.46]This guy's fucked up.
[63:45.06]Anyways, thank you, everybody.
[63:48.06]Let's keep going here.
[63:49.40]I lost track of where we were.
[63:53.66]Rewalls, thanks for the $1.
[63:54.93]It's talking about my depression's been getting especially bad and I don't know what to do.
[64:04.79]What do you do when you're in or when you were in a dark place?
[64:10.15]Honestly, you kind of have to try to, as much as it sounds not necessarily like counterintuitive, but
[64:23.19]I always had the best time to get out of, sorry about bumping that.
[64:28.33]What am I doing here by the way?
[64:30.33]I had the best escape from feeling down when I would surround myself with people that made me laugh.
[64:38.30]Honestly, like just friends and family.
[64:44.00]If you're not feeling good, you're feeling down, you're feeling like shit,
[64:48.90]You don't really want to be by yourself.
[64:50.72]You never want to because then you're just like alone with your own thoughts and your own head and you just kind of go over and over and over and over and over again the same shit.
[65:01.31]I always found it better just to kind of get out and do something or even just getting into like a call and just like talking to people online or just friends that you happen to come up or run into.
[65:12.64]You definitely want to like not close yourself off to friends and family.
[65:18.95]Because they care about you, they do.
[65:21.49]Especially if you got a few close friends.
[65:26.41]That's my best advice, for sure.
[65:32.14]Another thing, helping other, somebody mentioned it here too, and that's another philosophy I agree with.
[65:38.28]When you, if you're not feeling great, but you can make somebody else, you know that you can make somebody else feel good, and be happy, do it.
[65:48.07]Because like seeing somebody else happy because of something that you did is sort of this addicting back and forth process where it makes you glad and happy knowing that you are the reason why somebody or something else is happy.
[66:05.52]And I'm not just talking people, by the way, I'm talking about like animals.
[66:09.44]If you volunteer somewhere,
[66:12.27]helping somebody helping people helping animals you will get that sense of of actual kind of like real world like value and and you kind of you get to live off it you know family might care but they might be a little bit it's difficult because it might be a little bit clumsy yeah uh but anyway you can give happiness to somebody else usually it comes back to you in return so
[66:44.11]You turned in for Biaz and funny shit.
[66:46.25]What happened?
[66:47.81]Sometimes we talk real sometimes.
[66:49.23]It doesn't have to be all jokes and candy canes.
[66:53.05]It's sometimes you talk about shit that's hard to talk about.
[67:01.28]You took part in a charity Twitch stream done by my university club when I was depressed.
[67:05.14]Best part of uni this year.
[67:06.28]Yeah.
[67:12.30]It's a cycle of trying to do things for other people, I think.
[67:22.38]Because I get, and I'm like, this is like something brewing down here that wants to come up so bad and I'm like shoving it back down.
[67:31.24]So bear with me for a moment.
[67:33.37]Okay, I think we're alright.
[67:36.69]I think a lot of times we put happiness first
[67:41.28]next to like accomplishment, right?
[67:45.68]And accomplishment doesn't need to be money or famous or wicked good job.
[67:54.80]Like all those things are great, but accomplishment can be anything.
[67:58.50]You can accomplish small things for people that they see as very large things.
[68:06.53]So we tie happiness to like accomplishment
[68:10.80]And if you're not accomplishing huge deal things, then oh, what the fuck?
[68:15.20]You know what I mean?
[68:15.66]But in reality, you don't have to do that.
[68:23.23]You really don't.
[68:24.07]You just have to make somebody else happy.
[68:25.89]Make yourself happy by making other people happy in your life.
[68:30.99]As long-winded as I can put that.
[68:33.61]Big happiness from small things.
[68:38.56]Don't let the big things weigh you down.
[68:41.86]Because eventually, everybody figures out what the fuck they're gonna do.
[68:45.72]Everybody figures it out.
[68:47.72]Trust me, I'm 32.
[68:48.68]I might not look it, but I'm fucking 32.
[68:51.98]And trust me when I say this, from like 18 to 27, 18 to 26, I was just like lost at sea.
[69:05.73]I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
[69:07.53]You look 40.
[69:09.59]Thanks.
[69:11.05]Thanks.
[69:15.08]I never thought in a million years that I was going to do anything.
[69:18.49]I would always sit there and be like, oh, fuck.
[69:21.27]Things aren't going well.
[69:22.29]I don't feel great about my life, myself.
[69:25.96]Eventually, you figure it out.
[69:28.12]Sometimes it takes you until you're 30.
[69:31.74]Sometimes it takes you to be 35.
[69:34.03]Look, guys, don't worry.
[69:35.67]Everything's going to be fine.
[69:36.47]I'll tell you why everything's going to be fine.
[69:38.35]Everybody thinks like 30 is old.
[69:40.91]Hold on.
[69:41.41]Everybody thinks that like 40 is old.
[69:43.79]I don't think so.
[69:45.21]You see, because medicine's getting to a point where all of us assholes are living way longer than we ever like should have.
[69:51.53]We're going to be like 150.
[69:52.01]I'm going to live to be 145 years old.
[69:55.34]So right, 145 years old is like my goal.
[69:58.96]Because then we're gonna, medicine's getting to a point where like we're all getting fucking younger anyways.
[70:05.40]Don't worry.
[70:07.28]Everybody thinks that like their 20s is the end.
[70:11.39]And it's not even true.
[70:13.47]Like 20 to 30 is not the end for you.
[70:16.85]It's not.
[70:17.29]It's actually like here's where that is actually on the scale.
[70:20.61]And here's everything else.
[70:22.69]So don't worry.
[70:24.76]Keep focused, stay positive.
[70:27.30]And look, you can't be positive every single fucking day.
[70:30.28]Like when people say, no, all you gotta do is just be happy and stay positive.
[70:35.95]That's not realistic.
[70:38.21]I was fucking angry today.
[70:39.27]I was angry this morning.
[70:40.19]I was annoyed on the stream and I was not happy on the stream.
[70:43.11]You guys all knew that, I told you.
[70:45.53]So like, you have to just take each day, if it's bad or if it's good, and just roll with it, roll with the punches.
[70:55.99]You can't be happy every day.
[70:57.61]But again, you also shouldn't be sad or bad every day too.
[71:04.25]It's hills and valleys.
[71:05.24]That's right, Sam.
[71:06.16]Hills and valleys.
[71:10.58]What's weird is that those cliches sound stupid, but the more you think on them, they suddenly become profound.
[71:15.96]Yeah.
[71:19.75]It's not laziness, it's demotivation.
[71:21.87]I just don't feel like it.
[71:23.71]Yeah, you just have to find something that you can latch on to and think is interesting and think is cool.
[71:31.70]Your local streamer yells at clouds.
[71:34.70]I do that sometimes.
[71:41.14]You can't be happy every day, but you sure as hell can try, right?
[71:44.45]And things are going to go wrong.
[71:48.77]I hate when it happens because I like to be in control.
[71:51.77]I like to think that every day I'm gonna be in fucking control of every situation and I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do every day and it's gonna work out and it never does.
[72:02.37]Actually like more than half the time it doesn't and it drives me crazy.
[72:08.33]You can't live your life in an unrealistic happiness, unrealistic goals that you set for yourself every day.
[72:18.02]Everyone's gonna be alright.
[72:20.90]Just take each day normally.
[72:24.79]Jeremy, please do a photo shoot so we can have more than one picture of you.
[72:31.78]Having trouble with that, especially in writing, it feels like time is moving too fast.
[72:37.41]It ain't... Trust me when I say this.
[72:39.59]I mean, it just feels like it.
[72:42.81]It feels like it.
[72:43.49]You're still so young.
[72:45.17]You're so young and full of life and energy.
[72:47.80]I'm 32.
[72:49.26]Look at me.
[72:50.46]32, right?
[72:52.32]32.
[72:53.04]Just like do that.
[72:53.74]Why am I doing... That has nothing to do with anything.
[72:55.08]That has nothing to do with what we're talking about.
[72:58.16]Why is my physical apparatus... Just forget I did that.
[73:02.05]Anyways.
[73:02.29]32, right?
[73:03.53]Why am I standing?
[73:04.09]Sit down.
[73:06.65]It...
[73:07.53]A lot of you, I'm like 10 fucking years older than a lot of people in this chat.
[73:12.87]Some of you guys are as old as me.
[73:14.59]Some of you guys aren't.
[73:15.25]Some of you guys are a lot younger.
[73:17.75]That's a long time.
[73:19.41]That's a long time.
[73:21.57]10 to 15, 10 to 20 years is a long, very long time.
[73:28.72]Stand.
[73:29.40]Yeah, I gotta stand.
[73:30.14]I gotta like show you guys something.
[73:39.02]10.
[73:39.04]Time for me to run for president?
[73:42.55]Be a 32-year-old president?
[73:44.15]I could do it.
[73:45.87]I got so many policies that you guys are gonna love.
[73:48.25]I can stand.
[73:53.57]And I can do this.
[73:56.44]No, I'm not doing that again.
[73:57.64]That was my video game application.
[73:59.46]It's not gonna transition to being president.
[74:06.36]Those are my criterias.
[74:08.17]I can flex and look at how good I can stand.
[74:12.91]I don't lift.
[74:13.91]I stopped lifting like 25,000 days ago.
[74:18.25]Alright, let's roll the punches here.
[74:20.59]Let's roll the moves here.
[74:23.35]I got on that tangent, but the moral of the story is so many people are going to give you advice.
[74:32.22]And advice is kind of
[74:36.39]Advice is weird because it's me telling you how I do my life.
[74:44.61]It's me telling you how my life went and how I do my life.
[74:49.67]My life is a lot different than yours.
[74:51.33]Your life is much different than mine.
[74:53.13]So me giving you advice is very subjective.
[74:55.51]You have to take all advice you get with a grain of salt.
[74:57.77]Make your own advice.
[75:00.09]Make your own advice and make your own way.
[75:06.09]because somebody might not be telling you what's actually true for your particular circumstance.
[75:14.05]I can't tell you exactly what to do or how to act or how to react because we come from potentially different countries, different worlds, different circumstances.
[75:27.30]He can tell me how to be happier and better at life and worse at games.
[75:32.54]Come on, man.
[75:36.54]Come on.
[75:37.46]I love that.
[75:38.22]Today was an off day.
[75:39.74]I beat Metro 2033 on Ranger mode.
[75:41.78]No problem.
[75:42.32]It took me like seven and a half to 12 hours.
[75:46.78]Different worlds.
[75:47.66]I don't know.
[75:48.26]I told you.
[75:48.60]I have a lot of viewers from like the alien planets.
[75:55.61]Local streamer reveals he is an alien.
[75:58.93]Maybe I am.
[75:59.53]Why do I have Chibata open on a tab?
[76:01.73]Oh, we were talking about bread.
[76:04.19]Alright.
[76:04.53]Anyways, let's...

[77:11.37]Yeah, but like different universes.
[77:13.17]You're from like Korea.
[77:15.23]Korea's like two moons that way.
[77:17.59]I'm from the United States.
[77:19.11]The United States is in the Milky Way galaxy.
[77:21.62]Where are you from?
[77:22.88]Oh, you're from France?
[77:24.44]France is like way, France is the red planet all the way down there, right?
[77:28.14]Oh, wow, we're light years away.

[77:36.71]But anyways, thank you so much, Uwak.
[77:40.10]Glad that I can be somebody you can listen to to help.
[77:45.36]The word I'm looking for is not defined.
[77:49.88]I'm searching.
[77:51.27]Swiss cheese brain is searching.
[77:53.31]The cogs are spinning right now.
[77:57.03]Help you with your English.
[77:59.18]I was going to say a more intelligent word, but I have Swiss cheese brain.
[78:05.56]Especially today.
[78:08.36]Thank you for confiding in me.
[78:10.14]There it is.
[78:13.64]Thank you, Anthony 1215 for the $1 as well.
[78:18.08]Donated before and donated again to let you know how happy your streams make me when I get the notification on my phone.
[78:22.89]Currently working on a cartoon.
[78:24.91]I wanted to take one week off.
[78:27.74]which may up taking two weeks and is really stressing me out, but listening to your streams and advice really makes me feel better and puts everything in perspective.
[78:34.40]Thank you.
[78:35.84]If you do a cartoon in a week, like a full cartoon, that's a remarkable feat.
[78:44.45]The animation art, it takes months or weeks, years of time to do.
[78:50.19]Just let it happen.
[78:51.27]Let it happen the way it's going to happen.
[78:53.33]Just do your best.
[78:54.41]That's all you can do.
[78:56.61]It's all we can do.
[78:57.51]Hey, thank you, Abomination0 for the 10 bucks.
[79:02.30]You're the only streamer who does more than play games.
[79:05.40]You're such an inspiration.
[79:06.60]Love ya!
[79:07.70]Also, PB&Js are great.
[79:09.04]Fuck you, die.
[79:14.51]That's a good end.
[79:15.13]That was the end of that one.
[79:17.69]But Abomination, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[79:20.79]I don't think I'm the only person that does not just playing video games.
[79:24.60]There's plenty of people that... And look, I don't want to... I hope nobody's getting that vibe that I'm trying to tell you that those streams aren't worth watching.
[79:36.89]Because they are.
[79:39.15]You don't have to listen to me to tell you what you should watch.
[79:42.77]If you like something, then enjoy it.
[79:46.31]I'm not trying to say that a video game stream doesn't have any...
[79:50.51]inherent value.
[79:51.49]Of course it does.
[79:52.83]This whole entire space is the concrete of it is exactly that.
[79:58.52]So I'm just saying for me personally, it's going to change a little bit in 2018.
[80:03.80]Also, thank you to Joe Dirt.
[80:09.58]Joe Dirt, thank you for 50 bucks, $50 from Joe Dirt.
[80:14.19]Thank you, Joe.
[80:16.22]Joe Dirt 1212.
[80:17.75]Hey, Jerm, I've been watching you since I was a wee lad.
[80:19.83]20 now and living kind of the adult life.
[80:23.98]I often miss your streams because I'm busy, but you've made me laugh more than it is healthy.
[80:28.06]So take my gas money.
[80:29.66]Cheers.
[80:31.17]Love you.
[80:34.42]If you got a good job going here, man, you just gave me a gas money.
[80:37.08]I don't want you to run out of gas on the way to work tomorrow.
[80:40.79]You're going to be like driving to work.
[80:42.77]Alright.
[80:43.57]Time for work.
[80:44.25]That was okay.
[80:45.27]Today's a good day.
[80:45.97]I'm going to be like, start the car, get on the highway.
[80:48.23]What's that E?
[80:51.80]Oh, wait a minute.
[80:52.68]Do I have any, I got, no, I'm sorry.
[80:54.56]I got 50 bucks in my bank account.
[80:57.81]Jeremy, you motherfucker.
[80:59.25]Like, you're going to hate me.
[81:00.35]Because you're going to, do you have gas in your car?
[81:02.81]You got gas, right?
[81:03.75]You got like at least like a quarter tank to get to work?
[81:05.70]I hope so.
[81:08.18]Because if you don't, then I'll buy gas and I put it in my car.
[81:13.36]And then like, I'll ship you my car and you can use my car to drive to work.
[81:17.50]And look, it only costs like $4,700.
[81:18.40]It's not a big deal.
[81:18.80]That's a huge deal.
[81:24.82]I'm running on empty.
[81:27.14]But thank you so much, dude.
[81:29.06]That's 50 bucks.
[81:31.47]That is more than anyone is ever expected to give me in one sitting.
[81:38.63]That's a lot of money.
[81:39.79]Some people give me 50 bucks.
[81:41.03]Some people give me fucking hundreds.
[81:42.69]Some people give me thousands of dollars.
[81:47.36]It's a lot of money.
[81:48.22]That's a lot.
[81:49.08]Thank you.

[86:02.63]You guys are punching me in the chest?
[86:05.67]Like I'm not a punching bag.
[86:06.95]I'm a goddamn human, okay?
[86:19.95]Yeah.
[86:20.33]Yeah.
[86:20.65]Get it out there.
[86:21.35]Okay.
[86:21.77]Yeah.
[86:22.05]Yeah.

[86:22.71]Oh, that's what you're into.
[86:23.73]Come on.
[86:24.23]Yeah.
[86:24.49]Yeah.
[86:24.65]Yeah.
[86:24.83]Let's hear it.
[86:25.49]Come on.
[86:26.31]Let's hear it.
[86:26.85]Come on.
[86:27.11]Let's hear it.
[86:27.46]I want to see more.
[86:28.18]Oh, W. Oh, wow.
[86:29.34]Let's see.
[86:29.72]Let's see.
[86:30.30]Let's see.
[86:31.16]Let's see his dick.
[86:32.44]Right.
[86:32.72]Is that what he said?
[86:33.54]Is that what he said in the chat?
[86:36.54]Hey, guys.
[86:37.78]Let's see his dick.
[86:39.00]Right.
[86:39.18]Is that what you want?
[86:39.86]Is that what you want?
[86:51.60]Anyways, thank you, Spencer.
[86:55.56]Spencer, that was a joke.
[86:58.13]I'm not even a real person, Spencer.
[86:59.91]I'm a character.
[87:01.81]The person controlling me is in the other room.
[87:04.61]Jeremy's in the other room right now in a VR... I want to... I so badly want to say this.
[87:21.09]But I can't.
[87:21.85]I can't.
[87:23.87]It hasn't been enough time.
[87:25.69]I have the best joke.
[87:28.35]I have an unbelievable joke.
[87:31.96]But I will spoil and ruin something.
[87:34.58]So I can't.
[87:35.24]I can't do it.
[87:35.82]I have to wait like another month before I can make my best joke ever.
[87:43.07]It's going to be on Twitter.
[87:45.57]I'm going to get like 30,000 retweets.
[87:47.37]Because it's the best joke I've ever made.
[87:50.21]Especially in a short form, like 100, 200 characters, it's going to be perfect.
[87:55.54]But I can't say it now.
[87:57.46]Because I need to wait like 30 days.
[88:00.24]Because I'd say 30 days after the release of a movie is like, alright, if you haven't fucking seen it, I'm sorry, but where have you been?
[88:09.36]Where have you been?
[88:10.98]You know what I mean?
[88:14.34]A month after the release of a movie.
[88:15.97]No, no, no.
[88:16.91]Whenever it gets on rental, whenever that is, that's probably like two months.
[88:22.11]If you have not watched it on iTunes yet, when it comes out in two months after the launch of the movie, I'm sorry.
[88:29.22]That's the limit there for when a joke is able to be made on a piece of movie or TV or video game material.
[88:40.89]I mean, that isn't a thing anymore.
[88:42.71]You can watch it on iTunes.
[88:43.91]I watch movies on iTunes all the time.
[88:49.44]Two months after digital release.
[88:50.80]Yeah.
[88:52.76]A year?
[88:56.82]What are you talking about?
[88:58.36]Once it's on iTunes, it's like two or three months.
[89:03.27]I'm going to put a release date on this joke because I have to.
[89:05.34]Because if I don't, then I'm going to ruin.
[89:08.06]Look, with this tweet, if you haven't seen it, I'm going to ruin.
[89:15.20]Absolutely ruin a recent movie.
[89:19.60]It's going to ruin the whole fucking movie.
[89:21.70]The entire movie is going to be ruined from this tweet.
[89:25.41]So I've got to wait a good few months.
[89:31.80]Spoiler warning.
[89:32.66]No, I can't do that because even if you say, look, I've had this happen in real life where somebody has told me, nah, dude, just tell me.
[89:42.92]I don't care.
[89:43.82]Just tell me the whole thing.
[89:46.76]And I do.
[89:48.01]And then like weeks later, they're like, yeah, I would have watched it, but like Jeremy fucking spoiled the whole thing for me.
[89:56.63]Motherfucker, you told me to tell you what?
[90:00.27]And people get angry with you.
[90:05.69]Did I just get raided?
[90:06.89]Somebody just raided me.
[90:17.29]Thank you, Rom.
[90:19.51]Thank you, Rom's love.
[90:21.97]For a hundred people just came in here.
[90:26.28]I have two raids.
[90:27.30]I have one from Kryken from like 25 days ago.
[90:32.16]And now one from ROM.
[90:37.45]Well, thanks.
[90:38.33]Thank you.
[90:41.39]Thank you for the raid.
[90:44.67]How many people are even here right now?
[90:49.13]Welcome to Jerma talking about jokes he won't tell.
[90:54.17]I'm like the fucking shittiest IRL streamer.
[90:56.39]Like, I feel so bad.
[90:59.63]Like, oh, is this like IRL streamer?
[91:03.27]Just a guy sitting here with an Aquaman shirt on.
[91:05.35]By the way, they're Aquaman pajamas.
[91:08.30]Not even the fucking real deal.
[91:10.36]They're bullshit.
[91:11.94]Not a real shirt.
[91:14.32]But thank you.
[91:14.84]Thank you, Rom.
[91:15.92]Welcome, everybody.
[91:17.62]From Rom's stream.
[91:19.46]Hope you had a good stream.
[91:22.78]Please tell us a joke.
[91:23.54]Alright, I'm going to tell you the joke.
[91:25.92]I don't want to hear about this in fucking, in two weeks, I don't want somebody to be angry with me.
[91:30.46]Everyone's going to be so angry with me because I told them this fucking huge ruin the movie spoiler.
[91:35.38]This is, no, but then I'm going to, everyone's going to leave.

[91:39.42]Okay, guys, I have a fucking spoiler for one of the most popular movies last week.
[91:45.05]I'm going to say a bunch, I'm going to ruin the whole movie.
[91:47.09]I'm going to lose 200 fucking thousand people.
[91:50.21]I'm going to lose like 900 viewers in a second.
[91:53.82]Oh, shit.
[91:54.42]I got to get out of here.
[91:55.40]No, I'm not doing it.
[91:59.34]I'll type it.
[91:59.94]No.
[92:00.36]Alright.
[92:00.82]I'm going to make a separate... I'm going to make a new Twitch account.
[92:03.60]And it's going to be called something.
[92:04.92]I'm going to tell you what it is.

[93:00.99]And, oh, Jeremy, why do you have, like, another Twitch account?

[99:18.08]So, by the way, here you go.

[100:13.02]If you have not seen The Last Jedi, turn off your chat, both chats, because it's going to be over.
[100:23.09]I'm trying to do the situation where I'm doing an alternate place.
[100:27.20]This is where the joke's going to be.
[100:28.80]If you've not seen The Last Jedi, tread with caution, okay?
[100:36.98]Get rid of this chat.
[100:38.36]Get rid of that chat.

[101:52.28]I'm gonna say it a lot different on Twitter, but like, that's the joke.
[102:01.09]Hold on, how the fuck could you have possibly been following this channel for three months already?
[102:07.87]What?
[102:11.09]There's no way you've been following this channel for three months.
[102:20.66]What?
[102:23.17]That was fucking funny.
[102:27.55]This person hasn't been following the channel for three months?
[102:38.70]What?
[102:39.56]I don't understand.
[102:40.38]Has this person been following the Master of Comedy 209 for three months?
[102:46.46]The account just got created.
[102:48.50]What's going on?
[102:49.80]Why can people talk?
[102:52.54]Who's doing this?
[102:57.00]Did somebody already get into the account?
[102:59.92]Not possible.

[103:17.20]Spencer's fucking with me here.
[103:19.73]Spencer is like taking down the wall.
[103:21.95]He's taking the wall down.
[103:27.74]Alright, let's tone it down.
[103:29.74]And also another thing.
[103:37.21]I am not the master of comedy anymore.
[103:39.67]This account, I'm just gonna block it away in case I need it ever again.
[103:44.05]I actually, somebody like, I got like three people that hit me up recently about like accounts that I have.
[103:51.25]Oh, Jeremy, what's going on with, what's going on with your like fucking like fucked up weird old accounts?
[103:56.22]It's like, dude, I didn't make any of these things.
[103:59.32]Like people, I was, yeah, I was reading bits.
[104:03.00]You're right.
[104:05.56]People see like the word Jerma985 and they think that like I have something to do with it.
[104:10.66]They had a lot of fake fucking haircut, fake haircuts.
[104:17.84]So self-conscious.
[104:19.14]I turned over here and saw somebody say, nice haircut.
[104:23.12]And I fucking had to say, I just, in my brain, I had to say it.
[104:26.50]Nice fake haircut.
[104:35.69]Anyways.
[104:38.97]I don't have, like, I have a Twitter.
[104:40.80]I have a Facebook that I haven't used in three years.
[104:48.29]That's it.
[104:49.59]I don't have any official other accounts.
[104:51.59]If you follow a guy on fucking Pinterest and his name is Jerma985, it's not me.
[104:57.38]It's not me.
[104:59.64]I'm not fucking that person.
[105:01.10]Do you understand?
[105:01.80]You know, Jeremy, I was on your old LiveJournal account and I saw that you wrote a bunch of fucking awful shit.
[105:13.89]What are you talking about?
[105:14.97]Twitter.
[105:16.11]Twitter.
[105:19.79]Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, old Facebook account.
[105:29.78]That's it.
[105:31.14]Don't believe anything else or there'll never be another one.
[105:36.70]Where can I donate to the Master of Comedy 209?

[107:37.23]Uh...
[107:43.63]Well, I'm going to have to make Master of Comedy 210.
[107:50.10]Because I don't remember what the password was.
[107:57.45]And I X'd out of the window.
[108:08.91]The Master of Comedy 209 is no longer... Alright, so I have a lot of old accounts.
[108:13.89]I have a lot of fake old accounts that aren't me.
[108:16.55]Let's go over them.
[108:17.94]Don't have a Reddit account.
[108:19.34]Reddit's not me.
[108:20.64]I don't have an Instagram account.
[108:22.24]I don't have a fucking Tumblr.
[108:24.18]I am not the Master of Comedy 209 anymore.
[108:26.92]You understand?
[108:33.68]Keep that in mind when you're searching through the internet.
[108:39.87]Alright, let's wrap it up.
[108:44.17]Let's wrap it up.
[108:51.45]Master of... Oh, we actually have a real The Master of Comedy.

[109:39.62]Anywho.
[109:43.24]Thanks, everyone, for watching.
[109:45.42]Much love.
[109:46.84]I'm gonna go through these bits now very quickly.
[109:49.34]Thank you for all the incredibly nice donations.
[109:52.09]Thank you for all the wonderful things everybody's said.
[109:56.81]All the subs, all the resubs, everybody, thank you so much.
[110:00.05]We'll be back on... We'll be back on Tuesday.
[110:03.75]I'm gonna refresh.
[110:04.67]I'm gonna hit the refresh button.
[110:07.43]Get my brain and body in check.
[110:12.58]Uh, and I actually had some fun tonight.
[110:14.50]I actually had a lot of fun tonight.
[110:18.38]So let's go through these rapid fire.
[110:21.16]And then the stream is going to cease.
[110:25.17]Thank you to CMDRabbit for the $1.
[110:28.65]Thank you to the Master of Comedy for the $15.
[110:32.51]I'm trademarking this name.
[110:33.63]Stop trying to steal my username, you short... Okay.
[110:38.99]Uh, excuse me.
[110:41.53]If you wanted to... I know I'm supposed to be ending the stream, but... This is just... This is kind of like a situation where... So I said the master of comedy.
[110:51.65]I said I'm the master of comedy.
[110:55.37]That's a VOD that's going to be here with a timestamp of me saying that.
[110:59.89]So then you made the master of comedy when I said that was me.
[111:03.71]And I was going to do it.
[111:05.19]So you made it, and now you're actively telling me that you're going to trademark the name?
[111:08.91]I think if I had that, it would hold up in a court of law.
[111:14.58]That would hold up in a court of law, I think, and I would win that case.
[111:17.02]I would win the 15 bits.
[111:18.99]I would win the 15,000 bits there.
[111:23.29]This is somebody named Jerma985 pretending to be you.
[111:30.37]Thank you, Master of Comedy.

[120:34.75]I'm 23.
[120:35.01]Recently got a promotion to supervisor.
[120:37.01]I felt the need to share my excitement with someone.
[120:39.57]And I figured why not throw some dollars at you to celebrate.
[120:41.63]Love you, you attractive man.
[120:43.41]Thank you.
[120:46.46]23 and now supervisor.
[120:48.62]That's very young.
[120:50.53]You're obviously doing the right things.
[120:52.15]And you're making the right calls.
[120:53.51]Because to get a supervising position at 23 is very, very, very, very good accomplishment.
[120:58.32]Nice work.
[121:01.40]Keep at it.
[121:01.84]I wish you the best, man.
[121:02.36]I love video games.
[121:17.59]Code is hard.
[121:18.54]Programming is hard.
[121:19.62]Design is hard.
[121:20.38]It's fucking incredibly difficult.
[121:21.66]Everything is hard.
[121:24.08]Nothing's easy.
[121:26.74]Don't let anybody ever tell you that anything is easy.
[121:29.66]It's not.
[121:31.68]But if you love what you're doing and you care about it, you make it happen, you know?
[121:37.63]Nothing's easy.
[121:41.55]Hard.
[121:44.62]Eating is easy.
[121:45.36]No, it's not.
[121:46.18]Eating is really hard.
[121:47.82]It's fucking hard.
[121:49.64]You gotta wait for it to not be hot.
[121:51.76]You microwave mac and cheese in the microwave oven.
[121:54.50]You know how hard that is to not eat that right when it comes out and burn your mouth?
[121:58.72]It's incredibly difficult.
[122:00.40]You know, it's hard to cook food.
[122:02.37]Are you kidding me?
[122:03.81]You know how difficult it is to make like a full dinner and get everything right?
[122:09.61]When was the last time you made a full dinner and didn't fuck up something?
[122:13.39]Mashed potatoes were too watery.
[122:17.16]Your steak was a little undercooked.
[122:19.76]Ah, fuck, I screwed it up.
[122:21.04]You burnt your mouth on the pizza.
[122:22.50]Because you ate the pizza and the cheese came down and hit you in the chin.
[122:25.84]Eating is not fucking easy.
[122:27.18]It's hard.
[122:30.50]Did you say Hot Pockets?
[122:32.04]Hot Pockets are the most nuclear, explosive device inside of your mouth.
[122:36.37]They hurt every time.
[122:39.51]Nothing's easy.
[122:41.43]Sleep isn't even easy.
[122:43.54]Going to bed is not even easy.
[122:45.27]You know how much trouble it is sometimes to like go to sleep and actually fall asleep and not roll around and waking up in the morning is incredibly difficult.
[122:54.83]You're lying there.
[122:55.49]You still want to sleep.
[122:56.35]Maybe you didn't get enough sleep.
[122:57.45]It's hard to pull yourself out of bed.
[122:59.21]Sleep ain't even fucking easy.
[123:00.71]Come on.
[123:10.94]Nothing's easy.
[123:14.15]If sleep was easy, I wouldn't be watching this stream.
[123:16.17]You see?
[123:22.40]Going to bed would be easy if you entered the stream because it's 4 a.m.
[123:25.50]right now.
[123:27.96]Old man describes his difficulty with everyday tasks.
[123:31.44]They're not easy.
[123:32.69]Driving a car is not easy.
[123:35.43]You want to know how I can tell you that driving a car is not easy?
[123:37.87]Because there are like... People get into car accidents every day.
[123:44.43]You know how many times I've seen somebody, like, bump somebody?
[123:47.25]Backing out of a spot?
[123:49.05]How many people have, like, just crashed into somebody else just, like, driving and taking a left and like, Yo, take off, shit!
[123:54.60]Driving's not easy.
[124:04.47]Your second account has become a speakeasy for banned memes.
[124:15.73]I gotta, like, lock that fucking shit down, man.
[124:24.42]Oh, my fucking god.
[124:25.78]Oh, it's alright.
[124:27.50]Let him have cake, you know?
[124:28.94]Let him have cake sometimes.
[124:34.87]Walking isn't easy either.
[124:35.81]I've tripped.
[124:36.59]I've stubbed my toe on, like, the corner of a desk.
[124:38.97]It hurts and you get angry.
[124:47.00]Alright, let's keep going.
[124:50.53]Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[124:51.85]Who else did we miss?
[124:55.03]I think we missed only down here.
[125:00.98]Yeah, we saw the Bazinga.
[125:05.32]We got the D&D.
[125:06.20]Yep, yep, yep.
[125:07.03]Just making sure I don't miss anything.
[125:11.73]Uh, Abeve, thanks for the five dollars.
[125:13.40]Abeve, Abeve.
[125:15.40]Deremo, I've missed your produced content on YouTube, and I'm happy you're starting to get more creative with this channel.
[125:21.38]That's the plan.
[125:22.64]The plan is I want this to be sort of a happy marriage in 2018 of produced content and live stream.
[125:33.79]I feel like it's an avenue that needs to be tapped into.
[125:37.81]So I'm gonna try.
[125:40.62]It's currently here.
[125:41.80]Why not give it a try?
[125:44.16]Thank you also to Pin.
[125:45.89]I like where this is going.
[125:47.19]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[125:48.65]Thank you, Eeps, for the $1.
[125:52.19]Also, I'm not sure you realize my username is a joke of yours.
[125:56.95]From five years ago that shall not be named.
[125:59.57]Was wondering if you know.
[126:03.25]Eeps?
[126:03.47]Fs?
[126:03.79]E-E-P-H-S.
[126:10.49]F's.
[126:10.63]What did I do five years ago?
[126:13.89]I don't even know what I did fucking two weeks ago.
[126:19.89]Username of a joke.
[126:28.34]Oh.
[126:29.52]Oh, right.
[126:30.98]Right.
[126:31.48]Oh, okay.
[126:33.52]Remembering's hard.
[126:34.76]Remembering is not easy.
[126:37.63]you think about this honestly put this through your fucking tube your hole in the side of your head think of every day think of every day every experience you have every day think of the amount of time the minutes the hours the moments those moments that you see every day you store them in your brain hundreds of fucking moments thousands of fucking pieces of information
[127:05.46]You know, I still have deep in my fucking brain.
[127:08.78]I still know how to do algebra somehow.
[127:12.80]Magically, I still know a little bit.
[127:15.23]I still remember.
[127:16.99]I still remember pieces.
[127:18.21]I can probably quote you parts of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
[127:23.44]I haven't seen that movie in like 17 years.
[127:29.02]You know how hard it is to remember?
[127:31.44]That's a fucking monumental feat that you can even remember anything at all.
[127:35.28]Anything, ever.
[127:36.31]You store it in your fucking hard drive in your brain.
[127:44.09]I remember what the cake tasted like on my ninth birthday.
[127:50.50]There's a lot of information here.
[127:52.30]There's decades of content, decades of hard drive information stored in here.
[128:04.08]Alright, we... Oh my god, there's so many more bits!
[128:08.06]There's so many!
[128:09.80]There's like 300!
[128:10.88]Alright, let's really go rapid fire here.
[128:17.85]Before I sit the rest of my night sitting here.
[128:22.65]There's like 150 more.
[128:23.61]Alright, we're going from the bottom up.
[128:27.20]We're going from like four hours ago.
[128:29.80]Bingo, here we go.
[128:32.04]We're going to go like a solid state drive.
[128:34.20]Fast, stable, and inscrupulous.
[128:39.02]Thank you, LaFerro, for the $1.
[128:41.12]Djack, thanks for the $1.
[128:42.15]You donated for the co-op stream a few days ago.
[128:45.67]Did you get around to reading it?
[128:49.95]I usually read all my bits and donations.
[128:54.65]But, uh, oh, you're talking about from two, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[129:00.57]An hour of bits.
[129:01.57]No, this is like three hours of bits.
[129:04.15]You guys spoil the fuck out of me.
[129:07.75]More money.
[129:09.81]No.
[129:10.55]Don't give any more money.
[129:11.76]Don't give any more money.
[129:13.52]Thank you, Djack, for the $1, like you just said.
[129:16.74]Stix Renegade for the $1.
[129:19.20]Do I know the way?
[129:20.06]That's a new meme.
[129:20.90]I don't follow memes.
[129:22.98]I don't follow the internet.
[129:24.97]I don't.
[129:25.29]I have a Twitter, guys.
[129:26.27]I don't know what that is, but thank you, Stix, for the $1.
[129:29.15]Penny Kettle, thanks for the $1.05.
[129:33.64]Uh, in case anyone doubts my meme-making accuracy, that you made this a picture of something your mother made using a picture of our dog.
[129:42.30]Safe... Wait, what is this?
[129:45.12]What is this?
[129:48.08]Is this an image?
[129:50.14]Is this gonna be like somebody's dick?
[129:57.07]There, here's the image.
[129:58.21]This is a meme-making ability.
[130:09.54]That's a good one.
[130:10.34]I like it.
[130:16.25]Thank you, Penny Kettle.
[130:17.71]Stay safe as well in this weather.
[130:20.79]Thank you to Jörg Psychoblot for the five dollars.

[130:31.34]Also, BigWeekRepresent.
[130:34.36]I talked about VRChat a little bit.
[130:36.10]I think I already might have answered your question.

[130:58.30]Mick Jams, thanks for the $1.
[130:59.68]Would I ever play something like Dwarf Fortress or RimWorld?
[131:07.81]I don't have the attention span to play RimWorld.
[131:11.77]I don't have the mental attention for my ADHD.
[131:14.51]It will pop out like a demon and I won't be able to do it.
[131:21.30]Thank you, Choji, for the $5.20.
[131:24.40]I think a Walmart brand stream software is pointing your phone at the monitor and talking over the audio.
[131:30.73]Thank you, Choji.
[131:31.53]Boy, that's true.
[131:32.71]Private Tickles, thanks for the $1.

[131:42.69]Hope it wasn't too bad for you.
[131:43.67]And also there's a new thing called Streamlabs OBS you should try.
[131:48.43]Loving the wacky shit.
[131:49.74]Loving the wacky stream.
[131:51.54]I've heard about the Streamlabs thing, but with anything, anytime somebody announces a product and they say it's going to be ready, hey, can't wait for people to try it out in a few months or a few weeks.
[132:03.62]Wait like three years before it actually works.
[132:06.28]So, can't say I'm super excited.
[132:08.41]We'll see, maybe.
[132:09.99]Thank you, Captain Magic, for the $15.
[132:14.85]The Carnival game was better.
[132:17.85]I think the Carnival game was a better stream.
[132:19.97]Metro was me being mentally annoyed and exhausted for some reason.
[132:23.75]I don't know why.
[132:26.11]But thank you for the $15, Captain Magic.
[132:27.95]Hiro Link, thanks for the $1.

[133:55.32]Hey, Jermis, I want to say that since my friend told me about you, I've enjoyed all your streams and videos.
[134:00.10]I even went back and watched your older videos on your main channel.
[134:04.39]I've been subbing here.
[134:06.25]I'll be subbing here in a couple days when I get my Prime sub.
[134:09.25]Thank you for that.
[134:10.65]Anyways, since you said that you wanted a new streaming program, I highly recommend checking out one called Bebo.
[134:17.86]It's really good and seems better than OBS.
[134:19.58]Much love.
[134:20.08]Bebo.
[134:22.51]Maybe I'll give it a look.
[134:24.67]Because XSplit is fucking... Like, somehow... Somehow XSplit is 500,000 times worse than OBS.
[134:36.43]You know what I mean?
[134:38.36]OBS is like the... I've had the most luck with OBS.
[134:41.82]XSplit is... I've just had absolutely no luck with XSplit at all.
[134:47.88]I hate it.
[134:54.18]But, thank you.
[134:56.46]I'll give it a look.

[135:03.95]McJams for the $1.
[135:07.05]How clean my room is looking right now compared to the older streams?
[135:09.93]Well, I've had a lot of cleaning to do.
[135:12.61]I've like smashed shit on the ground.
[135:14.19]I've done other things that I don't really want to talk about.
[135:18.80]I've spilt stuff on the ground.
[135:21.80]Lots of it.
[135:22.88]Had to do a clean up.
[135:24.79]eefs again man coming in with another five dollar donation I've been watching you since 2012 sometimes I even go to sleep listening to some VOD streams and shit because I have tinnitus and ringing in my ears so I hate silence but I could sit here all the time and with all that shit if you need a break man yeah um I'm sorry to hear that you have that condition that tinnitus is not um
[135:56.36]I feel like that is a really annoying condition to have.
[136:02.14]But if you can throw a VOD on or put some music on or something, and if I help you with it, then thanks a lot for even being here.
[136:11.21]Like, I should be thanking you.
[136:15.41]Because you just gave me $5 and you're hanging out in a chat like that on my stream.
[136:21.80]You're giving me way more than $5.
[136:26.35]Thank you so much, dude.
[136:29.35]I'm happy to be somebody you can listen to.
[136:33.73]Alright, we should be closing in here on a little bit more, and we should be good.
[136:36.81]I just don't want to miss any minute.

[136:44.47]Mick Jams, thanks for the $1.
[136:45.41]Anthony21215, thanks for the $10.
[136:51.21]Uh, your live streams are always entertaining no matter the subject you put on a show.
[136:56.89]Can you say, want to see my fidget spinner collection in a funny voice so I can use it in an animation?
[137:02.33]If not, it's okay.
[137:03.21]Yeah, let's do it.
[137:03.83]Let's do it.
[137:07.21]Oh, I'm going to get you like clean audio here, man.
[137:11.78]Hey, want to see my fidget spinner collection?
[137:17.98]I'll give you another one.
[137:21.20]Hey, you want to see my fidget spinner collection?
[137:23.84]I'll give you one more.
[137:28.76]Hey, you want to see my fidget spinner collection?
[137:32.50]Maybe you can use one of them.
[137:35.98]One of those will do.
[137:39.11]My only ask is just don't put me in a porno or something.
[137:42.67]Don't animate me and don't animate porn me.
[137:46.62]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[137:48.82]Neural Shock, thanks for the $1.

[137:56.52]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[137:57.96]Techno Toast, thanks for the bits as well.
[137:59.42]25 cents.
[138:00.06]CMD Rabbit, $1.
[138:01.55]Excellent.
[138:01.87]You deserve way more visibility.
[138:05.69]I don't know if deserve is even the correct word.
[138:10.67]I don't know if I want more visibility.
[138:13.69]This might sound weird.
[138:15.68]But I feel like... I like where the channel is right now.
[138:22.19]I got a lot of viewers.
[138:23.65]I have... I get between 2,000 and 3,000 viewers.
[138:26.37]That's a lot of people, if that's what you're referring to.
[138:30.25]I don't think I want, like, a 10, 20, 30k stream, if it ever was possible.
[138:35.80]I'm not sure I would... I don't know.
[138:39.36]I think... That this channel's in, like, a good spot right now.
[138:46.00]I have a lot of people that are here.
[138:48.28]My streams get a lot of attention.
[138:51.30]Way more than I could have ever possibly imagined.
[138:56.51]So I think the channel's in a good spot.
[138:59.95]If we grow, we grow.
[139:00.77]If we don't, we don't.
[139:01.43]That's fine.
[139:01.97]And even if it goes down, that's not something I'm going to be... You know, I don't focus on my viewer counts.
[139:10.70]And yes, I've made jokes about it.
[139:12.54]Like, oh, 500 people are leaving because I suck.
[139:15.48]But I mean, we all know those are jokes.
[139:20.71]But yeah.
[139:21.75]In reality, I just... I kind of have in my brain what... Oh no, what did I just do?
[139:27.09]I just like refreshed the fucking page like an imbecile.
[139:32.25]What the fuck happened?
[139:33.05]What happened to my bits?
[139:35.81]What happened to my money?
[139:37.31]Where's my money?
[139:38.90]Where's my money?
[139:39.96]I actually did just like get rid of it.
[139:42.74]How?
[139:44.93]Why is it empty?
[139:46.63]Why is it empty?
[139:48.17]Why is it empty?
[139:49.99]Did I clear all of my... What are you talking about?
[139:52.45]It is not here anymore.
[140:04.11]Okay.
[140:06.89]I cannot see the bits anymore.

[142:06.72]Master of Comedy 209.
[142:08.01]Remember, I have no control over it anymore.
[142:13.38]If you want to meme yourself to your heart's content, Master of Comedy 209 is not going to have any rules.
[142:19.61]Well, yes it will.
[142:21.95]It has the general Twitch rules.
[142:24.13]If you say something fucking stupid over there, then you're an idiot.
[142:30.45]You know what I mean?
[142:31.65]When somebody says you said something stupid, you're an idiot.
[142:33.37]You know what I mean?
[142:33.81]That's what it means.
[142:34.29]You said something stupid.

[143:59.05]MasterOfComedy209.
[144:01.61]Any Master of Comedies.
[144:02.61]Don't trust ever a Master of Comedy.
[144:07.26]You understand?
[144:08.84]You might see Master of Comedy like 20441.
[144:12.46]Don't fucking trust that guy.
[144:14.24]He cannot be trusted.
[144:16.80]Also, that chat, don't click anything in that chat.
[144:21.30]Don't touch anything.
[144:22.56]If you want to go look at that chat, that's fine.
