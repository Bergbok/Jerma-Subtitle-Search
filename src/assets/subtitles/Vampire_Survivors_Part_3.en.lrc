[00:31.75]There's one more rank.
[00:35.01]Did they add anything?
[00:35.91]What else did they add?
[00:40.39]Oh my god, fuck.
[00:41.31]I hate that there's no noise gate.
[00:45.91]I do want to turn this down.
[00:46.81]Because it's probably going to be pretty loud.
[00:54.75]There's three new characters and two new evolutions.
[00:56.53]Really?
[00:58.80]I turned it down for you, but not me.
[01:01.04]I turned it down for you guys.
[01:02.36]Thank God.
[01:03.15]Not for me.

[02:16.58]Okay, we'll go to the tower.
[02:20.68]There's so much shit to do.
[02:21.66]Unlock hyper mode for four normal stages.
[02:23.61]Alright, there's so much more.
[02:25.65]Alright, let's do this at that one first.
[02:26.75]So go to the tower.
[02:30.52]Let's refund.
[02:31.22]Who do I want to play with?
[02:35.48]Consetta.
[02:38.14]Where's Consetta?
[02:44.92]Consetta?
[02:45.43]I don't think I have Consetta unlocked.
[02:51.95]Alright, but we're going to go with Popia.
[02:55.67]Popia's got the cool shit.
[03:03.05]Movement speed.

[03:12.76]It's insane.
[03:15.78]Oh, let's do... Growth.
[03:20.66]Revive.
[03:21.62]Can I?
[03:22.00]I don't need it.
[03:23.19]Do I need to revive?
[03:23.83]Meh.
[03:35.36]I can almost do everything.
[03:36.10]Banish, skip, reroll.
[03:39.58]I'll do another banish.
[03:40.44]Yeah, another banish.
[03:41.42]I always use three banishes.
[03:42.94]Sound pretty good to me.
[03:44.46]Greed.
[03:46.14]And max health.
[03:48.03]Or whatever I can buy.
[03:48.89]I can't buy anything, so who cares.
[03:49.81]Alright, let's go.
[03:50.25]We're going to go to the tower with Popia.
[03:58.91]No, you dummy.
[03:59.71]Okay.
[04:03.07]Okay.
[04:05.62]The tower.
[04:07.96]Let's go.
[04:08.30]I've already turned this up.
[04:24.48]Feels weird, man.
[04:25.44]What?
[04:25.62]What'd I do?
[04:34.03]That sounds good.
[04:35.15]Let's do it.
[04:38.25]Alright.
[04:38.99]I want a garlic.
[04:44.61]So I'm looking for the question mark?
[04:50.01]Yeah, I'm going to the question mark.
[04:51.19]So I gotta go up.
[05:00.61]Mmm.
[05:01.41]I love lightning rod.
[05:02.03]It's like my favorite move.
[05:07.39]Feels weird, man.
[05:08.13]Put the music up louder.
[05:09.09]Nice face, nerd.
[05:24.00]You're on Twitch.
[05:27.78]You're on Twitch, dork.
[05:31.85]Ooh, Laurel.
[05:37.86]we're all dorks here okay we're all geeks nerds and dorks alright I'm gonna go up not me some of us are dweebs yeah well whatever you know
[06:03.52]When was the last time somebody said, dork?
[06:05.67]I feel like... I feel like that's kind of fallen off, right?
[06:09.81]Oh, shut up, you fucking dork.
[06:13.10]Yeah, whatever, you fucking geek.
[06:16.28]I kind of feel like there's a lot of... Yeah, I feel like people don't say it anymore.
[06:26.46]I feel like if somebody called me a dork, I'd... For a second, I would take a minute and go... Hey, like... Shut up.
[06:39.67]When are you gonna... I like when you play actual games and not meme shit.
[06:44.81]What, you think this is a meme game?
[06:46.07]This is like one of the best games on Steam right now.
[06:49.08]Uh, should I get the Termsu?
[06:51.84]Nah.
[07:00.09]Are we talking about the Puppet Combo stuff?
[07:02.82]I've never played it before.
[07:06.18]Yep, Song of Mana again.
[07:19.88]The camera's smudged.
[07:31.20]Was it Smudge the whole stream?
[07:46.16]It was?
[07:50.76]What the fuck?
[07:53.20]Uh, Garlic again?
[07:56.86]I gotta remember some of the combos here.
[08:03.00]I need duration.
[08:17.64]It's the shadow from the mic.
[08:19.85]Oh, that's alright.
[08:23.67]It's the mic shadow.
[08:24.53]That's fine.
[08:38.69]It doesn't make a difference in 160p.
[08:40.57]That's true.
[08:42.63]Oh, the cats!
[08:43.41]Right.
[08:43.67]Should I get the cats?
[08:45.57]No, they're kind of terrible.
[08:49.63]They eat all the food.
[08:51.82]And they attack you.
[08:53.24]They're terrible.
[08:55.08]Um... Hold on a minute.
[08:57.30]I need... I only have two more slots.
[08:59.54]If I'm going to do Eighth Sparrow, then I need the Tiramisu.
[09:04.45]I think I'm not sure what to do.
[09:05.41]I think I'm just going to do Garlic again.
[09:09.88]The cat evolution is great, I know, but... Let's look for the other gun.
[09:17.36]I can't pick up anything else, though.
[09:18.65]I need the other gun.
[09:21.11]I'm going for it.
[09:26.97]I need the tiramisu and the other gun.
[09:50.76]Will this guy die?
[09:55.32]Zoomer, Binding of Isaac.
[09:59.09]That's not right.
[09:59.89]Alright, Eight of... Eight the Sparrow.
[10:06.33]Yeah, I'll just upgrade this a lot.
[10:09.53]Looking for the other gun.
[10:12.04]This is not even remotely like Binding of Isaac.
[10:17.92]These guys respawn, it's annoying.
[10:25.72]Song of Mana again.
[10:26.56]I think I need to buy... I gotta get Curse for that, right?
[10:31.97]Alright, I'm almost there.
[10:36.91]Don't touch any of these.
[10:53.91]Ooh, alright.
[10:56.19]So I want that because I want to evolve the garlic.
[11:00.57]Eventually.
[11:09.01]Term of the question mark.
[11:09.91]I know.
[11:10.73]I'm heading up.
[11:13.52]That's my destination.
[11:14.58]I should get there soon.
[11:18.46]Well, I'm going to do this first because I have the evolution for it.
[11:21.82]So I want to get that quick.
[11:34.57]Are we there yet?
[11:35.09]Nope, not yet.
[11:36.39]There we go.
[11:37.91]Duplicator.
[11:38.95]Lightning.
[11:39.35]Alright, just don't mess this up.
[11:53.19]Laurel again.
[11:54.63]I need Laurel.
[11:55.41]I can't play the game without it.
[12:00.57]Especially after about 10 to 15 minutes.
[12:04.95]I just bump into so much shit.
[12:11.89]Oh my god.
[12:12.61]Oh, it's always Duplicator every time you see it.
[12:18.45]What's hitting me?
[12:19.09]Oh shit.
[12:35.60]Alright.
[13:02.70]I can't take any of these.
[13:04.98]Sorry.
[13:06.14]I need the other gun.
[13:08.36]We'll do lightning run.
[13:10.52]Sorry.
[13:14.02]Someone says, I think I'm going to go to bed.
[13:15.04]I had a lot of fun interacting with the Jerma985 chat section on Twitch.
[13:18.16]Jerma985 was super cool in his exploration of the murder house.
[13:20.64]I wish I could stay for a while longer, but alas, the sleepy time calls to me.
[13:24.03]Once again, thank you for the awesome livestream, Jerma985.
[13:26.59]Good night and sleep well.
[13:27.57]Wow, that was really nice.
[13:30.00]Hope you have a good sleep too.
[13:53.57]Ah, pentagram is sick.
[14:00.63]I'm going to leave that.
[14:03.99]In fact, let's hang on here for just a second.
[14:06.26]Because I'm close to... Not really.
[14:09.54]Just take it.
[14:11.22]Never mind.
[14:11.58]I'm not really that close.
[14:18.37]I'll get more.
[14:18.81]Damn it.
[14:38.99]I need cooldown.
[14:41.17]Bad.
[14:41.57]There we go, alright, we're good.
[15:00.90]I can't even walk over here.
[15:09.53]Alright, let's make a line for the question mark.
[15:21.69]There's a turkey right there.
[15:30.65]Looking for Curse, the other gun, a tiramisu... I'll take any of those.
[15:38.82]I might banish something as well.
[15:41.00]To make sure I get something.
[15:56.99]Banish the copypastas.
[16:02.34]I mean, they're gonna get banished if they're not careful.
[16:10.40]I want whatever's in here.
[16:12.12]Give me a chest.
[16:12.60]Do you guys remember the last time I played this a month or two ago and everyone was bat-chesting me because I was playing this?
[16:24.22]I'm not making that up.
[16:25.06]I remember that, right?
[16:27.32]That was a thing, wasn't it?
[16:30.50]I was getting bat-chested.
[16:33.10]Hold on.
[16:39.75]I think I heard auto.
[16:41.13]Was that auto?
[16:43.49]Let me see.
[16:43.73]I'll be right back.
[16:50.21]One sec.
[17:37.36]Yeah, it was.
[17:37.96]Just give me one second.
[17:40.14]I think he wants maybe some water.
[17:44.10]He's still kind of getting over the UTI, so I just want to make sure that he's good to go.
[17:47.45]I'll be right back.
[27:46.24]Okay, I'm back.
[27:46.78]Hello.
[27:50.00]Sorry that was so long.
[27:53.02]That was a long time.
[27:55.06]But I wanted to make sure he was good to go.
[27:57.26]And you can probably hear him crunching in the background.
[28:01.84]Yeah, he had to take his antibiotic.
[28:04.02]So that's kind of a little ordeal.
[28:05.86]He has to take it every 12 hours, and it's been almost exactly 12 hours.
[28:17.22]Where's this train wreck of a streamer?
[28:19.18]What are you talking about?
[28:20.60]I'm taking care of my dog.
[28:23.31]Give me a sec.
[28:29.11]Okay.
[28:30.84]It was a raid?
[28:32.30]Was there?
[28:35.70]Looks like a thousand people from Menace.
[28:38.70]Menace Alcamilla.
[28:41.37]What's going on?
[28:41.89]Welcome.
[28:43.35]Thanks for the raid.
[28:44.91]We're just kind of winding down here.
[28:46.91]Thanks for the raid.
[28:47.41]Welcome, guys.
[28:49.71]Playing Vampire Survivors.
[28:52.26]Just for a little bit to wind down the night.
[28:56.74]Yeah, he's good, though.
[28:58.67]But I wanted to take his antibiotic.
[29:00.63]He needed to go outside.
[29:01.93]He needed to go pee.
[29:02.59]He needed to get a special treat.
[29:05.67]For taking his antibiotic.
[29:09.21]He gets a treat.
[29:12.31]And we can go.
[29:12.99]Let's do it.
[29:16.24]Hello.
[29:18.82]Oh, it's been playing this music the whole time, hasn't it?
[29:27.94]It's just been going do, do, do, do, do.
[29:32.45]Alright, should I pick that up yet?
[29:34.39]Yeah, whatever.
[29:37.43]Yes.
[29:39.05]Yes.
[29:43.13]Really actually not that happy about that.
[29:46.49]Two of the heart ones, come on.
[29:48.53]I need both headphones in so I can hear the stereo sound.
[30:01.92]Alright, Song of Mana is at level 8.
[30:04.90]I need the Curse Skull, right?
[30:06.92]Alright, I gotta go up.
[30:16.11]I'm almost there.
[30:21.85]I need the other one.
[30:26.57]Or Tiramisu.
[30:27.85]Either one.
[30:41.59]I don't think I want to take any of these.
[30:43.75]Maybe the spinach?
[30:44.39]Alright, I need... The other gun.
[30:52.57]I need the curse.
[30:53.47]I could take the spinach.
[30:54.29]Or I could just reroll it.
[30:58.02]That sucks.
[31:16.26]Garlic.
[31:18.32]I need a curse.
[31:27.87]Okay.
[31:28.97]Garlic.
[31:29.59]Okay.
[31:30.67]Garlic 8.
[31:31.01]Alright, good to go.
[31:32.69]I just need a chest.
[31:35.24]Happy birthday?
[31:35.78]Happy birthday.
[31:37.02]Happy birthday to you.
[31:52.24]No more farming.
[31:56.28]It's not my birthday.
[31:57.38]Is it your birthday?
[31:59.15]Whose birthday is it?
[31:59.71]It's not mine.
[32:00.15]I don't want to see this ever again.
[32:06.95]Alright, this is where I'll get it.
[32:17.62]That's going to drop a chest, right?
[32:27.57]There it is.
[32:27.91]Alright.
[32:28.59]We got the garlic upgrade.
[32:33.19]There it is.
[32:34.71]Soul Eater.
[32:36.01]Steals hearts.
[32:36.71]Power increases when recovering HP.
[32:38.54]Let's go.
[32:38.82]Alright.
[32:53.12]Now I'm going to go up.
[32:54.50]No more farming.
[32:55.12]Go.
[33:01.07]Jeremy, you should be on Cameo.
[33:03.99]Um, no, I did every Cameo- I did Cameo for free.
[33:08.90]I said a hundred people's names and did birthdays or anniversaries or- it's still available.
[33:21.38]I think the website's still up.
[33:24.02]You didn't say my name, though.
[33:25.71]Oh, shit.
[33:35.75]Alright, almost there.
[33:36.63]Just keep going.
[33:45.42]Come on, give me the other one.
[33:48.54]Well, I got max lightning now.
[33:50.92]That's good.
[33:51.46]Just need a chest.
[33:54.97]Add more names to it.
[34:04.31]I don't feel like it.
[34:11.21]Okay, here we go.
[34:24.25]I'm hungry.
[34:24.69]We were talking about Pizza Hut five hours ago, and now I want it.
[34:28.51]I just want a large Pizza Hut pizza.
[34:32.79]All for myself.
[34:36.47]Here we go.
[34:48.00]This would be the lightning upgrade.
[34:51.72]Should be pretty sick.
[34:55.92]Should I get this?
[34:56.67]No, I need the other gun.
[35:00.69]That thing's really cool.
[35:01.85]That's too bad.
[35:08.96]No, I probably shouldn't eat pizza.
[35:12.40]That's good.
[35:16.81]Evolve Lightning Ring.
[35:17.65]Projectile Strike twice.
[35:21.08]And that's awesome.
[35:22.46]And it's really, really good.
[35:23.66]Watch it.
[35:23.98]Here it comes.
[35:25.32]Ba-boom.
[35:37.55]I really need the other gun.
[35:52.01]Alright, go get the item.
[35:58.99]Ate the sparrow, another one.
[36:05.78]Turn right at 1am?
[36:07.62]Yeah, I'm not streaming.
[36:08.52]I'm done after this.
[36:12.88]I'm only going to be live until this is over.
[36:17.73]That doesn't drop anything?
[36:20.87]I just needed a wind down from the puppet combo insanity.
[36:25.89]I needed a little wind down.
[36:38.60]Another one.
[36:43.37]Shit.
[36:50.98]I guess I could just take the attract orb, but... I don't know.
[36:56.14]Either that or skip.
[36:58.64]The attract orb is just... Or I could banish the armor or something.
[37:01.72]I'm going to banish armor.
[37:03.24]I don't want it.
[37:13.49]Oh, it's right here.
[37:14.03]Okay.
[37:14.49]I'm just there.
[37:25.10]What is that?
[37:25.48]What the hell is this?
[37:28.80]What the hell is this?
[37:29.42]What did I just do?
[37:29.94]I don't even know what I just did.
[37:34.50]Oh, I found it.
[37:35.34]It's that.
[37:35.70]Okay, so... Did I do it?
[37:49.09]Thank you, Papa.
[37:52.44]Korrina, the vampire is in another coffin.
[37:58.38]There it is.
[37:58.92]Consetta!
[38:01.78]Very cool.
[38:02.48]Got it.
[38:07.14]We'll check out what they do.
[38:12.31]Try to get to 30 minutes here.
[38:28.25]I need to be doing way more than this.
[38:32.68]Nothing else up here, right?
[38:33.64]I don't want to get the bracers yet.
[38:34.84]Alright, level 8, 8th Sparrow.
[38:42.89]Maybe the other one will show up now.
[38:50.30]Shit.
[39:01.37]Shit.
[39:06.34]I have to start taking something, though.
[39:08.12]Area, it's gonna be the candle.
[39:11.50]I need Spellbinder and candle.
[39:13.14]They're both alright.
[39:13.80]I'll take the candle.
[39:17.76]To upgrade what I have, I only realistically need the Curse, and then the Terramisu.
[39:40.95]Duration is fine.
[39:41.97]I only need Tiramisu and Curse, so I can take Spellbinder.
[39:47.56]Or Cooldown.
[40:01.53]I'm skipping.
[40:10.87]Those are the good shit.
[40:11.67]I keep missing it.
[40:12.27]Spellbinder is good.
[40:14.93]I know what it is.
[40:15.45]It really is.
[40:15.89]Alright, that's good.
[40:18.17]Come on.
[40:21.79]That's huge.
[40:24.07]Look at the area now.
[40:28.10]Look at the garlic area.
[40:30.06]That's just stupid how big that is.
[40:37.62]Where's the Song of Mana?
[40:38.71]Oh.
[40:40.20]How come the Song of Mana is not shooting anymore?
[40:44.84]What's going on?
[40:47.89]Song of Mana isn't firing.
[40:51.43]The mirror broke it?
[40:54.41]Wait, why is it... Oh, there we go, finally.
[40:56.12]Okay, why is it not shooting?
[41:01.28]What happened?
[41:06.36]The game looks fun.
[41:07.00]The game's amazing.
[41:07.72]I think it's bugged.
[41:11.20]Hold on a second.
[41:12.10]Is something wrong?
[41:12.62]What's the matter?
[41:14.17]What's the matter?
[41:15.43]Where are you?
[41:17.17]Hello, Agile.
[41:19.83]I think he wants something again.
[41:20.67]Do you need something again?
[41:22.49]What can I do for you?
[41:24.23]Okay, well, watch out.
[41:24.97]Move over there for a sec.
[41:27.51]Watch out.
[41:28.71]What do you want?
[41:30.37]Yeah, I guess there's something he wants.
[41:32.99]Do you want me to help you?
[41:34.61]Yes.
[41:35.86]Okay, let's go.
[41:37.72]Otto!
[41:38.64]You want me to show him?
[41:39.70]I can't really.
[41:40.24]Let's see if I can show him.
[41:41.52]Otto!
[41:42.14]Can you see?
[41:43.54]Alright, Otto, they want to see you.
[41:44.78]Come over here.
[41:45.80]Over there.
[41:48.10]Otto cameo.
[41:48.90]Hold on, let me see if I can... It's too dark in here.
[41:53.25]Hold on.
[41:54.65]I'll show him.
[41:58.55]Let me turn the light on.
[41:59.17]Do you hear him?
[42:04.47]Can you hear his feet on my, uh, thing here?
[42:09.39]Okay, can you see him?
[42:13.17]I'll just turn the light on.
[42:13.89]I do?
[42:21.32]What's that over there?
[42:23.68]Go, come up here.
[42:25.84]My hair looks fucking crazy.
[42:34.78]Hey, look, Otto.
[42:37.60]Otto, look.
[42:39.50]Otto.
[42:41.74]Otto.
[42:42.80]Look over there.
[42:44.06]Look over there.
[42:44.40]What's that?
[42:45.32]You want to go?
[42:45.96]Okay, let's go.
[42:51.19]Okay, let's go.
[42:51.91]For real.
[42:53.87]No, he's not wearing pants.
[42:54.77]I... I don't care.
[43:01.80]Man, alright.
[43:03.14]Give it a rest.
[43:07.63]Alright, what are you looking for?
[43:10.15]What do you need?
[43:11.02]Alright, give me one second, I'll be right back.
[43:15.48]Caught you!
[44:09.39]Somebody said this song is driving me insane.
[44:14.07]Why?
[44:17.61]It's not that... Okay, I'm going to have one earphone in because I don't know if he's... He might need me to follow him again.
[44:25.40]I think he's just bored, if I'm honest.
[44:28.76]I think he's just bored.
[44:44.37]Okay.
[44:46.63]I'll finish this.
[44:47.06]This won't take that long.
[44:48.00]Another 12 minutes or so.
[45:00.23]Yeah, what happened to the Song of Mana?
[45:03.07]Is it actually... Is it happening and I just don't see it?
[45:05.29]I'm very confused.
[45:09.96]Is the animation bugged?
[45:14.71]Go back into the mirror.
[45:15.69]Hold on, I will in a sec.
[45:26.63]Yeah, so what's the problem?
[45:32.24]I can hear it.
[45:33.02]I think it's happening.
[45:40.06]Um... I can't leave.
[45:47.24]Uh-oh.
[45:49.71]Oh, shit.
[45:50.19]That's not good.
[45:53.41]What if I just sit here?
[45:56.09]What if I just sit here?
[45:57.23]I can just win.
[45:57.85]I don't have to do anything.
[45:59.74]Just sit here and win.
[46:00.50]This is a free win.
[46:03.18]Okay.
[46:03.56]Alright.
[46:07.42]Oh, there we go.
[46:13.37]I don't know.
[46:13.79]I think the animation is bugged.
[46:15.77]I think it's actually still happening, but we just can't see it.
[46:20.67]That's my theory.
[46:27.69]Good.
[46:35.12]I can... Uh-oh.
[46:37.52]I need the tiramisu, and I need the curse.
[46:41.92]There it is!
[46:44.79]Okay, so now if I evolve it, maybe it'll fix it?
[46:47.29]Alright, I need to resume.
[46:54.58]Hopefully it fixes it.
[47:02.92]Oh, I turned off the damage numbers, yeah.
[47:16.53]Oh my god, die.
[47:19.79]How much health do you have?
[47:21.39]Holy shit, that was ridiculous.
[47:22.79]Okay, do I have enough?
[47:26.85]Yeah, I do.
[47:27.17]Let's do it.
[47:28.42]Alright, please fix it.
[47:33.86]Might slow enemies.
[47:34.76]Does it fix?
[47:38.76]Um... I... Yeah, it did.
[47:42.62]Alright, it's good.
[47:43.13]It fixed.
[47:43.57]Alright, thank god.
[47:49.35]That would have been bad.
[47:57.31]Yeah, it comes up from the middle.
[47:58.19]Alright, now we're looking for a tiramisu.
[48:04.50]And that's it.
[48:05.80]And that should get me pretty much what I want.
[48:08.32]Just survive.
[48:13.08]We're at a Pizza Hut Bistro.
[48:16.54]What the hell is Pizza Hut Bistro?
[48:26.38]We got a little six.
[48:39.25]Alright, be careful.
[48:39.97]I don't want to die.
[48:43.11]The spammers won.
[48:45.32]I don't know what happened.
[48:46.26]Terrible soup.
[48:55.04]Terrible soup.
[49:00.57]Oh, hell yeah.
[49:01.63]This is a guaranteed win.
[49:08.64]I'll open up another slot too.
[49:23.60]And... there it is.
[49:25.12]Alright.
[49:25.64]I got... leveled up.
[49:27.16]Yep.
[49:28.60]Let's open that chest up and let's see the double... the double revolver upgrade.
[49:35.06]It's actually pretty ridiculous.
[49:38.70]I think it's just a huge circle.
[49:40.78]Union of Ferrara de la Tefilo and Eight of the Sparrow.
[49:45.72]Check this out.
[49:49.59]I need duration.
[49:50.77]Oh well.
[49:57.42]Okay, now I can go down.
[49:58.38]I can collect all this shit down here.
[50:02.51]And I can take... What should I get?
[50:04.19]What's the candle upgrade?
[50:07.27]Or the clover.
[50:07.85]Which one?
[50:13.27]Cross is one of them, right?
[50:19.11]I actually don't really want to upgrade the skull.
[50:23.21]Axe and cross.
[50:23.79]Which one's better for this build?
[50:26.88]Probably the cross, right?
[50:35.78]Oh no, axe is better.
[50:36.86]Because axe is the spin.
[50:39.55]Yeah, I'll get the axe.
[50:40.91]If it shows up.
[50:50.69]And... It's okay.
[50:52.14]Okay.
[51:08.97]You know, I got a craving for Bugles, too.
[51:10.72]I just want a big bag of Bugles.
[51:13.15]I'm gonna eat the whole bag.
[51:29.62]Tons of area, yeah.
[51:32.34]So much area of effect.
[51:33.38]I could probably just stand still, to be honest.
[51:36.06]Yeah, I can.
[51:36.52]I'm going to stand still for one minute, and I'm going to collect, and I'm going to get all the items.
[51:42.32]Try the spicy fried chicken bugles.
[51:44.10]I don't know why those sound terrible, but I feel like I probably would like them.
[51:47.90]Those sound gross, but good at the same time.
[51:55.88]I can't really... I gotta move.
[52:08.22]Alright, come on, stop.
[52:28.95]I'll take it.
[52:30.40]Ooh, that's a tiramisu.
[52:33.02]That means I get to revive if I die two times.
[52:41.26]There's so much food left over from the Tearless stream.
[52:44.82]I'm not going to eat Mike and Ike's snow caps and butter bread for dinner.
[52:52.29]That's not what I'm going to eat.
[52:55.85]Well, it's over.
[52:58.77]I'm probably going to have to just do Santa water.
[53:02.89]Or whip.
[53:06.37]Whip is probably better for here.
[53:10.77]How much is left?
[53:12.23]Uh, the two diet sodas are still in the fridge.
[53:15.07]I refuse to drink them.
[53:18.39]Upgrade the whip?
[53:19.21]I can no longer upgrade anything.
[53:21.79]I'll take the water.
[53:22.43]The water's just area.
[53:24.99]Um, what were we just saying?
[53:28.38]Yeah, okay, I've opened up the fridge and gone, okay, wait, there's a soda in here.
[53:32.12]I drank all the other ones, besides the diet Mountain Dew and the diet Coke.
[53:36.80]All the other ones are gone.
[53:41.06]But man, I just think of drinking the diet soda and I go, that's grossing me out.
[53:47.32]I do not want it.
[53:49.48]And I get kind of annoyed that it's in there.
[53:52.11]I get sad and irritated that it's in the fridge because I can't drink it.
[53:56.17]I don't know what to do with it.
[54:14.27]diet soda sucks it really does it's just awful I know some people have that specific palette that really loves diet soda I'm not I am not one of the metal pour it in your engine
[54:40.84]I'm not going to do that.
[54:42.54]That's a very bad idea.
[54:43.70]Um, I'm gonna have to upgrade the Skull-O-Matic.
[54:52.69]This is gonna be a disaster.
[54:57.08]Five minutes?
[54:57.58]Okay, I'm just not gonna level up for five minutes.
[55:10.87]Regular soda is too sugary.
[55:13.57]You know what?
[55:13.95]This is... You can't really do this with soda.
[55:16.50]But... I will buy... Juice from the grocery store.
[55:21.64]And... Instead of drinking it just straight up... I dilute most of the juices that I drink.
[55:28.17]Besides orange juice.
[55:29.57]Which I feel like... Orange juice and apple juice you can't do this with.
[55:32.69]But all the junk...
[55:35.11]The cranberry juice cocktail that tastes like you're drinking a syrup.
[55:39.88]I dilute it by 50%.
[55:41.88]Lemonade.
[55:42.94]Store lemonade.
[55:44.30]Lemonade you buy in the store.
[55:47.41]I dilute by about 40 to 60%.
[55:51.17]So if I buy a, I don't know, what, two liter of lemonade?
[55:56.77]That'll last for fucking two weeks at least.
[55:59.82]It lasts a very long time.
[56:07.98]I dilute a lot of my drinks.
[56:14.28]I guess I could go pick up those items.
[56:15.52]Yeah, I'll just do it.
[56:18.43]What is that?
[56:20.51]Um, what is that?
[56:21.39]What's going on?
[56:23.59]That's kind of weird.
[56:24.14]I don't know what that is.
[56:24.70]I'm afraid to go over there.
[56:37.12]I'll even do that with Powerade or Gatorade, too.
[56:44.18]If I get a large Powerade from something like McDonald's or something, I always drink half of it, and then put water in it.
[56:53.01]Drink half of it, put water in it, drink half of it, put water in it, until it's... Uh-oh.
[57:00.07]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[57:02.18]I gotta... I'm dead!
[57:02.98]I'm dead!
[57:03.30]I'm dead!
[57:03.66]I'm dead!
[57:03.94]I'm dead!
[57:04.18]Just relax.
[57:04.90]It's supposed to be a wind-down.
[57:05.68]I'm fine.
[57:14.53]It gets to a point where it turns into, like, homeopathy.
[57:19.13]I just deluded so much.
[57:21.17]Don't die.
[57:22.11]Please.
[57:22.41]I don't have enough dip.
[57:23.95]I'm fucking dead.
[57:24.55]Oh my god, what happened?
[57:25.43]No, I'm fine.
[57:25.88]I can revive.
[57:26.54]Just run.
[57:29.10]What is going on down here with this fucking weird cold shit?
[57:31.98]Guys, I'm gonna die.
[57:32.98]I'm gonna lose right now.
[57:33.98]I've never seen this before.
[57:37.94]I'm dead.
[57:38.42]It's a loss.
[57:38.96]Game's over.
[57:39.74]I don't know what's happening.
[57:42.06]I can't even do anything.
[57:43.00]I couldn't move.
[57:45.29]You picked garlic.
[57:46.35]What just happened right there?
[57:47.59]Half my screen, like my CRTV fucking is broken.
[57:51.37]My CRT TV is broken.
[57:53.09]What the fuck is going on down here?
[58:01.46]What is this?
[58:02.70]Why is half the screen, I can't go over there?
[58:07.40]What the fuck was that?
[58:17.51]Who gives a shit?
[58:18.41]What were we even just talking about?
[58:19.49]I'm pissed.
[58:20.03]What were we just talking about?
[58:20.87]Because I'm never bringing it up ever again.
[58:23.79]I dilute all my drinks like a fucking weirdo.
[58:26.05]Alright.
[58:27.41]Good to know.
[58:29.41]Okay.
[58:31.72]I go to the sink and I fill it with water and I make the Powerade last an extra six hours.
[58:38.04]Dude, you're a fucking weirdo.
[58:39.82]Stop.
[58:41.98]Why can I not do this?
[58:46.79]Can I buy it?
[58:47.63]Oh, alright.
[58:53.09]What the fuck?
[58:54.01]I'm so pissed.
[58:57.48]Ooh, I want to see what that does.
[58:58.50]Gains 1% area every level.
[58:59.94]I'm curious what it does.
[59:03.60]So I want area.
[59:11.17]I can't believe I just died.
[59:12.37]I wasn't killing anything fast enough.
[59:14.91]I'm fucking mad right now.
[59:29.04]Alright, let's check it out.
[59:33.64]Moon glow?
[59:34.78]What's moon glow?
[59:39.95]Should I try it?
[59:40.37]Alright, what's this new weapon?
[59:46.45]Whoa.
[59:48.33]Does it go in the area that you aim in?
[59:55.36]Oh.
[59:57.44]That's kind of weird.
[60:00.56]That's pretty weird.
[60:02.86]Wind down?
[60:03.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[60:04.44]Yeah, I'm out.
[60:05.26]I said I was only going to do one round.
[60:07.59]You're right.
[60:10.33]What is... Look at all this.
[60:14.11]Um... There's just items everywhere.
[60:21.18]He's cranky.
[60:24.62]I was... I'm shocked that I lost.
[60:29.27]I was doing so well, and then I was talking about diluting my Power Aids.
[60:35.46]I feel like the next thing I was gonna say was, oh, I also reused my Band-Aids, too, because they're fine.
[60:40.22]I take them off the cut, and I put them in a box, and then when I have another cut, I put, like, what am I talking about?
[60:45.28]What the hell am I talking about?
[60:54.75]He's Sprugal.
[61:01.64]Rugal.
[61:06.06]This character's pretty cool.
[61:09.38]No, no, why would you don't do that ever?
[61:11.26]Why would you ever do something like that?
[61:12.99]Talk to the guy in the middle?
[61:13.77]Oh, I thought that was an enemy.
[61:21.57]What?
[61:24.73]Golden Egg?
[61:27.21]Summons the merchant in all stages for 10,000 bucks?
[61:38.80]Um, that's, okay, so I can buy stuff?
[61:41.78]It's another money sink.
[61:43.68]Well, that makes sense, considering if you have more than a few hundred hours in this game, you can pretty much buy every single upgrade in the power-up list.
[61:52.88]So I'm imagining this is the way to make it so people have to drop 20 grand.
[61:56.84]That was fun.
[62:02.40]Alright, that was fun.
[62:02.96]Yeah, yeah.
[62:03.80]I'll stay away.
[62:05.96]I was only going to do one.
[62:09.22]More than a few hundred.
[62:09.96]It was a few grand.
[62:13.08]It was like five, ten grand.
[62:16.24]Alright, what was today?
[62:17.18]Let's talk about what we're doing this week.
[62:19.74]I have access to the MultiVersus game, so I want to play that.
[62:25.29]Let's get a schedule here.
[62:26.11]Alright, here you go.
[62:29.05]Here's a schedule for you.
[62:31.75]Wednesday, we're going to do multiverses and probably the House Flipper pet DLC.
[62:42.47]And then this weekend, probably Friday and Saturday or Saturday, Sunday, we'll do something else.
[62:50.23]But Wednesday, we're going to do multiverses and, you know, fucking pets DLC.
[62:59.38]Sounds good.
[63:03.68]You should play SOMA.
[63:09.18]When's the Elden Ring PvP thing?
[63:11.53]You know, I... I gotta talk to Ludwig.
[63:15.49]Because I... When we did that last time, it was just... It felt like so difficult to actually get that to work.
[63:23.75]And then it kind of fell out, fell out, and fell out, and fell out.
[63:28.11]So I don't know if we're going to do it.
[63:31.37]I'll ping Ludwig and see.
[63:32.43]Maybe we'll do something else.
[63:37.64]Go get a Snickers.
[63:38.36]You're not you when you're hungry.
[63:39.88]I'm fine.
[63:40.44]I'm having a good time.
[63:41.18]I've been having a good time this whole time.
[63:46.14]You should try People's Playground.
[63:47.52]I'll check it out.
[63:49.83]When are you going to do the green screen stream?
[63:53.05]I will announce the date for the green screen stream when we get closer to it.
[64:01.62]But over the next night or two, you will see a green screen discussion for you to please go to that channel, talk about what you want me to do, actions you want to see, because this is the last time I'm ever going in front of the green screen.
[64:14.49]Ever.
[64:15.67]This is it.
[64:16.49]This is the third and final four to six hour green screen stream.
[64:22.81]And then after that, there will be a green screen movie night.
[64:28.37]I know the whole copyright thing.
[64:29.51]I don't give a shit anymore, if I'm honest.
[64:33.09]I feel like I've had that bottled for two and a half years or so, two years.
[64:38.33]And I'm just going to do it.
[64:41.01]So we're going to have some rules in place to make it so it's not, if you do it, if you're going to, this is all stuff for like a couple weeks from now, but there's going to be rules for copyright.
[64:51.10]There's going to be rules for length of the videos and we'll, we'll get there, but let's just, let me get in front of the screen first.
[65:00.99]Why is this gonna be the last one?
[65:02.03]It just is.
[65:05.99]This is the last green screen stream.
[65:07.73]I feel like it kinda has to be.
[65:16.04]Can I find the stream schedule anywhere?
[65:19.60]Um... I don't really have one.
[65:23.06]If you want to know my schedule... Well, this is not even accurate either.
[65:26.98]Exclamation point sus, nothing to do with Among Us.
[65:29.78]That was my thing before Among Us came out seven years ago, okay?
[65:34.60]Exclamation point sus, it'll tell you the general idea of when the next stream will be, usually a date.
[65:39.51]Sometimes I do it another day, sometimes I do it early.
[65:45.13]Whatever.
[65:46.88]Whatever.
[65:47.20]It's okay.
[65:47.80]It's okay.
[65:48.38]I might do a stream earlier than Sus or later than Sus, but that's a general idea.
[65:53.26]And I usually stream about two or three times a week.
[65:56.16]At least once.
[66:00.23]He's never been earlier in his whole life.
[66:02.83]Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
[66:04.67]I was early literally two days ago.
[66:06.97]Three days ago.
[66:08.79]That stream was not supposed to happen on that day.
[66:10.53]It was supposed to be a day later.
[66:11.80]It was literally three days ago.
[66:15.72]Sorry.
[66:21.82]Dermot, when you retire, can I have your life force?
[66:26.54]Um... Why do you think it should just be you?
[66:32.22]No.
[66:33.10]I want you to fucking... I want you to fucking sprinkle my fucking ashes... Ever.
[66:41.35]I want you to fucking sprinkle my ashes in a place where I want to grow into a big fucking tree with a lot of shade and I want people to be able to come in and enjoy the shade as a- I want to be a big oak tree.
[66:55.55]Retirement doesn't- well that is- retirement does not mean you're gonna die.
[66:58.41]Yeah.
[67:04.62]Retirement means you're gonna get cremated.
[67:10.28]I probably shouldn't retire then.
[67:15.76]Turn him into an Erdtree?
[67:21.30]Alright, I'll see you later.
[67:22.64]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[67:23.44]Thanks for watching as always.
[67:26.71]We'll do Multiversus and the Pets DLC on Wednesday.
[67:29.59]See you in a day or two.
[67:32.03]And then we'll see you this weekend as well.
[67:41.65]Can I keep some of your ashes for jewelry?
[67:44.57]No.
[67:47.13]No.
[67:47.82]This is what's going to happen to me.
[67:49.80]My urn is going to be filled with fertilizer and like fucking vitamins for an oak tree.
[67:55.22]You're going to put an oak tree seed in the urn and you're going to bury the urn.
[68:00.95]That's what happens to me.
[68:10.25]Yeah, I want vitamins.
[68:11.29]I want oak tree vitamins.
[68:15.07]I want you to sprinkle in a little bit of stuff that I like.
[68:19.23]You know?
[68:20.01]Maybe some green tea powder.
[68:22.45]Stuff that I like, too.
[68:25.11]A tree will be dead in a week.
[68:30.90]I want some orange juice.
[68:33.00]If the thing's gonna sprout up, it'll just be dead.
[68:44.43]God.
[68:49.12]You should be an apple tree.
[68:50.32]No!
[68:50.82]I don't want people to eat me.
[68:53.23]That's kind of weird to me.
[68:57.34]I just want to be a huge, towering oak tree.
[69:00.92]And the only thing you could ever do is if somebody ever came up with, oh, we can hear, we can hear the oak tree.
[69:07.24]Some sound-o-phone or whatever.
[69:10.70]All I want is to be able to hear, like... That's all I want you to be able to do.
[69:20.18]Nothing else.
[69:20.87]I want you to be able to hear that.
[69:25.05]It's going to be a short tree.
[69:26.35]No, it's going to be the biggest oak tree in the forest.
[69:32.78]In the whole forest.
[69:39.81]Yeah, you're gonna put your ear up to the bark, and you're just gonna hear like... Nutella.
[69:53.67]Yeah, you put your ear up and you just hear... Nutella.
[69:59.93]What do you mean, ow?
[70:15.15]Stop that.
[70:16.47]I didn't do... I'm looking at my... That's not even that loud.
[70:19.27]They're gonna chop you down for a housing development.
[70:28.18]No, they will not.
[70:29.06]I will stop them.
[70:32.68]They will get to my tree.
[70:35.12]And the... It's gonna darken.
[70:37.81]And a storm is gonna... Start rolling in and then lightning.
[70:41.91]Strike, strike, strike!
[70:43.54]All around the tree.
[70:44.64]All around me.
[70:46.50]And they're gonna go, we gotta get out of here!
[70:48.12]Oh my god, this is crazy!
[70:49.98]A storm!
[70:52.11]And then right when they leave, the sun is gonna start shining and a sun shower is gonna happen.
[70:57.39]And every time they come over there, every time they try to take my tree down with a bulldozer, the storm rolls in again.
[71:04.12]Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning!
[71:08.02]Grr, grr, grr, grr, grr, grr, grr, grr, grr!
[71:13.18]They'll never take me down.
[71:19.12]This sounds like a child made this story up.
[71:22.12]Oh, let's just get rid of our imaginations.
[71:26.80]Okay, bye.
[71:28.18]I'll see you Wednesday.
[71:29.08]Good night.
[71:29.56]Goodbye.
[71:30.02]Take care of yourselves.
[71:31.06]Call your mother.
[71:32.38]You know.
[71:34.31]Good night.
[71:34.89]Goodbye.
[71:35.21]Take care of yourselves.
[71:36.29]Call your mother.
[71:38.87]See you Wednesday.
[71:41.09]Goodbye.
[72:04.35]you
