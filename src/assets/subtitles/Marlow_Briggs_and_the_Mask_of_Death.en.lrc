[00:01.63]I don't know what this is.
[00:02.47]I have no idea what this is, but we're going to play it.
[00:05.29]Let's go.
[00:07.09]Watch your ears.
[00:07.61]Watch your ears.
[00:08.13]I'm serious.
[00:08.75]Watch your ears.
[00:09.13]It's going to be loud.
[00:10.09]We're playing this right now.
[00:11.61]I don't even know why I have this, but I don't know what it is.
[00:14.59]But it's a game.
[00:15.45]We're going to play it.
[00:17.79]It's going to be loud.
[00:22.31]Loud.
[00:22.67]Loud.
[00:22.87]I told you.
[00:23.45]Loud.
[00:23.63]Loud.
[00:26.23]I told you.
[00:31.49]Is this even being captured?
[00:32.39]Oh my god, seriously.
[00:43.05]Hold on.
[00:50.45]This game needs a controller.
[00:56.82]I don't know what this is.
[00:59.03]But I'm going to change my stream title to this.
[01:01.41]And, like, I have to do this.
[01:03.43]Hold on.
[01:07.79]Okay.
[01:09.25]That doesn't work.
[01:10.11]Obviously, why not?
[01:11.11]Why would it work, right?
[01:15.28]Okay, there we go.
[01:16.14]Alright, this is what we're playing.
[01:20.34]We're playing Marlow, Briggs, and the Mask of Death.
[01:25.30]Tell them.
[01:27.08]Okay, Marlow breaks.
[01:34.52]Does anybody know what this game is?
[01:35.80]I have no idea what this is.
[01:43.60]I apparently own this.
[01:48.55]Is this game good?
[01:51.95]Resume game?
[01:52.57]I haven't even started a game.
[01:58.72]This game is amazing!
[01:59.80]Okay, I'm gonna reload Checkpoint and see what happens, because I have not opened this game one time.
[02:07.04]Yeah, go.
[02:09.21]Oh, okay.
[02:09.89]This is the opening cutscene.
[02:22.66]Okay, I need to change the volume.
[02:32.32]This game kicks ass.
[02:33.22]Don't skip it.
[02:36.98]Partial nudity.
[02:47.14]You know when somebody makes a short film and they don't... They make the volume of the... Did we just teleport?
[02:53.09]Ah, Miss Torres.
[02:55.09]Lovely to see you again.
[02:56.97]From the look of things, I take it
[02:59.75]I remember when this was a skate stream.
[03:01.29]Well, yes, but... Excellent.
[03:05.69]And you are?
[03:07.01]Marlow Briggs.
[03:07.71]Oh, there he is.
[03:08.51]That's my boyfriend.
[03:09.71]He's visiting.
[03:10.33]That's the title character, right?
[03:11.48]Well, we can always use more workers.
[03:15.12]Wow, that Man O' War update really changed the game.
[03:17.98]I know, really.
[03:19.46]We've recovered the last major codex, and it appears to be in remarkable condition.
[03:23.97]Wonderful news.
[03:31.33]And he's dead.
[03:32.77]Game over.
[03:33.75]Thank you for playing.
[03:39.78]And he died.
[03:43.42]Rise, beer.
[03:47.08]Alright.
[03:56.73]Nice, I got this cool scythe.
[03:58.33]Alright, I'm into this right now.
[04:06.47]All right, where am I?
[04:13.10]Where I work what character boss Why does this feel like so disconnected oh boy this is kind of gonna make you throw up hold on We're gonna go we got to change this volume bad I
[04:29.32]You drop way down.
[04:31.98]Music like 40.
[04:33.18]Effects is like okay.
[04:36.42]Turn this on.
[04:37.06]Subtitles.
[04:37.58]Okay.
[04:40.26]So what do I do?
[04:42.27]Alright.
[04:46.39]Nice.
[04:49.39]There's like a dodge?
[04:51.13]That's Steve Blum.
[04:52.25]Alright.
[04:52.63]Interesting.
[05:00.79]I'm not sure why I have this, by the way.
[05:02.69]Does everything make me throw up?
[05:08.80]Because I'm a very sensitive boy.
[05:15.57]It's like God of War.
[05:16.85]This is still very loud.
[05:23.69]Every fucking game like serious every single game has to be so loud It's like they just want to make sure it's all dialed up to a thousand no matter what What am I supposed to do Now it's like too low
[05:47.36]Whoops.
[05:55.81]Can I go this way?
[05:59.01]I obviously can't go.
[06:00.09]Oh, there we go.
[06:03.59]Now it's too quiet.
[06:07.29]Oh, don't worry.
[06:10.18]We're just waiting for Man of War to be ready.
[06:14.02]When Man of War is ready, we're going to chase monsters around.
[06:21.44]We're just in, like, an extended cutscene still.
[06:26.25]Yeah, there's a lot of lore we missed.
[06:27.61]Very important stuff, I think.
[06:29.93]Can I fight a guy?
[06:30.75]Now it's too low.
[06:40.89]And just, like, putting it up, like, 10%.
[06:41.75]I am P. L and P?
[06:44.41]What the fuck are you talking about?
[06:54.25]I'm not sure where this guy is going.
[06:57.61]I thought I was going to run off the cliff for a minute.
[07:05.08]Use the arrow keys to move?
[07:06.62]I actually feel like I would enjoy this game off stream.
[07:22.63]Coil of death.
[07:23.45]Yeah, apparently I'm dangerous.
[07:29.83]Collect more and upgrade your weapon.
[07:31.31]Alright.
[07:33.65]I'm not sure if this camera angle is because I'm doing something incorrectly or because it's just a really strange camera angle.
[07:42.54]Alright, what's the... What's the percentage?
[07:49.46]Alright, okay.
[07:50.68]I think it's done.
[07:53.54]Man O' War Corsair is ready to play.
[07:58.32]Man O' War Corsair is ready.
[08:00.13]So we're exiting this game.
[08:02.07]That's all I wanted.
[08:02.67]I just wanted to make sure that you have something on the screen before Man O' War Corsair was there.
[08:09.55]And now Man O' War Corsair is ready to play.
[08:12.01]So we can go back to doing exactly what we wanted to do.
[08:13.83]And let's play this.
[08:19.77]All right.
[08:20.21]So there we go.
[08:22.49]There was that game.
[08:26.71]Now let me just load this.
[08:27.61]By the way, close your ears.
[08:30.07]This is going to be loud as well, I would assume.
[08:40.46]It would launch.
[08:45.40]I remember this was a Marlow Briggs stream.
[08:48.25]It was for about 15 minutes.
