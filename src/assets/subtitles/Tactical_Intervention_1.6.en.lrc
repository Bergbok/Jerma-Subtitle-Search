[00:00.19]Oh, look at me.
[00:00.77]Look at me drive.
[00:01.35]You can look over and, like, watch me drive.
[00:06.10]Vroom vroom vroom.
[00:08.52]Who's the enemy?
[00:09.18]Oh my lord.
[00:16.28]Wow, he flipped.
[00:18.12]Hi, I made Counter-Strike 14 years ago.
[00:21.42]Try my new game.
[00:26.01]Oh my god.
[00:28.21]Oh.
[00:28.75]My.
[00:29.49]God.
[00:31.35]Come over here, quick.
[00:32.29]Are you near me?
[00:32.67]I don't know where you are.
[00:34.13]This guy is holding his stomach like he's gonna shit his pants.
[00:40.27]This guy is running around like he's got a diaper full of shit.
[00:44.72]Oh, I'm dead.
[00:45.44]No!
[00:47.24]He just- Hey.
[00:53.18]Why did I go to work today?
[00:56.56]Why did I come here today?
[00:58.08]Do you see how this guy's holding his gun on our team?
[01:01.44]I think that's me.
[01:02.64]Like, above my head.
[01:04.16]That's you?
[01:05.22]Yeah, I'm holding it above my head.
[01:07.54]What?
[01:08.10]This is a game feature, mind you.
[01:12.73]It's really easy to pick you out of a crowd now.
[01:14.49]Yeah, it is.
[01:16.47]Get him, get him.
[01:17.65]I'm trying.
[01:18.15]You got him.
[01:19.89]Congrats.
[01:26.15]I got a feeling we're gonna get clipped.
[01:28.19]This guy, look at this guy.
[01:29.31]This guy, he's joining.
[01:31.61]He's gonna do it too?
[01:32.37]I would hope.
[01:34.62]Do you want to join the club?
[01:36.58]He's trying to figure it out.
[01:40.68]He's like, how are you guys doing that?
[01:42.72]Oh, we lost.
[01:43.98]I wonder why we lost.
[01:46.28]Yeah, I'm literally right behind you.
[01:49.60]What did that guy just do?
[01:51.88]What the hell?
[01:56.19]Don't worry, I'm coming!
[01:59.27]Where is he?
[01:59.75]Oh, he's right next to me!
[02:04.57]No, I don't- this is not what I- I don't- Stop running this guy over!
[02:08.73]I'm trying to just straighten out!
[02:13.14]Alright, I'm straight.
[02:14.56]Was I really just crushing this guy?
[02:17.40]Yes!
[02:18.58]Yes!
[02:20.79]Did we win?
[02:21.51]Stay down.
[02:22.61]Yeah, I caught him.
[02:23.79]Apparently.
[02:25.35]I'm ten and one?
[02:26.49]How are you ten and one?
[02:28.71]I'm not doing anything!
[02:29.75]What have you done?
[02:31.35]Nothing!
[02:31.93]Ten and one.
[02:32.65]Give me a fucking break.
[02:35.26]I'm the tryhard.
[02:37.08]Well, you were there.
[02:38.46]I'm not doing anything.
[02:40.42]You must have killed a bunch of people.
[02:41.52]We were the ones being, like, tactical intervention spy crabs.
[02:51.27]Oh my god.
[02:54.49]Oh.
[02:57.63]Awww.
[03:00.70]Do you hear the sound?
[03:02.28]Yes!
[03:05.60]Why?
[03:07.40]Why though?
[03:08.80]What?
[03:09.06]Oh snap, it's a crash.
[03:14.97]I'm bleeding.
[03:17.64]There, you're right there, look.
[03:18.84]Yeah, come here.
[03:19.52]This is gonna kill me.
[03:21.00]People are just spawning in, like, in... This guy doesn't even know I'm behind him.
[03:25.92]Oh my god!
[03:34.69]That scream.
[03:37.25]Oh god damn.
[03:40.41]And he's alive!
[03:41.37]Win.
[03:42.39]Yeah!
[03:47.23]What the fuck?
[03:48.77]Tactical intervention, man.
[03:50.37]Monster trucks.
[03:51.24]You know, I really love the strategy in the game.
[03:53.72]That's what captivates me.
[03:56.74]That hurts my brain.
[04:00.58]That literally hurts my brain.
[04:09.84]I can't.
[04:12.18]You can't even see to shoot.
[04:16.41]Okay, all of us in that room, we're doing the same damn thing.
[04:21.37]No, I don't think anybody in that room was playing.
[04:24.09]No, look, our team rank one, rank one, one, one.
[04:27.35]The other team is like, no, we're here to play tactical intervention.
[04:33.51]Okay, well, is that a dog?
[04:35.07]What the hell?
[04:35.45]What's this dog?
[04:35.99]I don't want to kill a dog.
[04:38.01]What the hell, man?
[04:39.81]What is this?
[04:41.03]Team X?
[04:41.83]Don't forget to buy your dog from the dog store, which will just go and attack people for you.
[04:46.07]You know, just spend some money on that and the individual damage, health, and speed upgrades.
[04:50.13]But, you know, don't worry.
[04:51.19]Even if you do that, it's only going to last for seven days at a time.
[04:54.47]If you don't want to spend money, you could just... game.
[04:58.13]You know, it doesn't even matter.
[04:59.19]Why does the game need dogs?
[05:00.77]What's with dogs?
[05:03.04]Doggy.
[05:07.00]Poor box guy.
[05:08.31]That's why I wanted to play on this level, it has like this stupid pick upables and there's zombies everywhere.
[05:13.03]Zombies?
[05:15.47]Oh yeah, I wanted you to feel- what?
[05:16.77]This guy's getting mauled by this dog.
[05:27.60]Aw, dammit.
[05:31.39]Tactical is a bad shit.
[05:40.28]Oh my god.
[05:41.58]Did you just get an ace?
[05:42.30]I am not trying.
[05:45.56]No, what the dog?
[05:46.74]You could potentially get an ace if you kill this guy.
[05:48.87]Nah, I couldn't do it.
[05:49.77]The guy just has dogs because dogs.
[05:59.33]Secure the gate.
[06:00.33]VIP is down.
[06:01.20]VIP is down.
[06:02.04]Let's go.
[06:02.62]Come on.
[06:02.94]Where are you driving?
[06:04.02]I'm going this way.
[06:05.98]It's behind us.
[06:06.66]We just drove past it.
[06:08.12]Wait, really?
[06:08.78]What?
[06:08.92]It's like... Thanks a lot!
[06:11.70]Yeah, there he is.
[06:16.03]Yeah, no, I walk like this all the time.
[06:27.94]You know, it's a good workout.
