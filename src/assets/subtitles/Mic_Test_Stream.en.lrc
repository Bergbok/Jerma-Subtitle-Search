[00:00.75]There's no intro.
[00:02.15]I don't have that anymore.
[00:04.59]I don't have that thing to do an intro anymore.
[00:08.51]Hi, guys.
[00:10.78]Coming to you... Here we are in Las Vegas!
[00:15.30]No.
[00:17.44]Where the fuck are we?
[00:19.78]I rented out a storage unit.
[00:21.82]And I'm inside of it right now.
[00:24.75]Streaming from a unit.
[00:26.75]This is not Las Vegas.
[00:28.05]This is not Las Vegas.
[00:32.69]All right, you guys want a house tour?
[00:34.41]Sure, might as well do it now, right?
[00:36.03]Sure, I'll do it.
[00:37.92]Okay, so this is where everything used to be.
[00:42.26]Bed, TV, computer, computer two, TV two, bed three, over there.
[00:49.74]That's it.
[00:50.81]And then stairs that lead up to the outside.
[00:52.79]This is one of those safe shelters.
[00:57.09]That's where I've been living for a long time.
[01:00.31]So if you go up those stairs, there's like a,
[01:03.34]It's a huge latch, and you open it, and you're up in grass.
[01:07.53]It's like a sewer, almost.
[01:11.97]This feels so cursed.
[01:15.39]Well, we'll wait for people to trickle in before we discuss what the hell's going on here.
[01:22.02]That peaked the microphone?
[01:23.30]Well, don't... Funny you mentioned microphones.
[01:27.54]Because we've got some...
[01:30.19]Audio scientific deduction to take care of this stream.
[01:34.07]Because this is what it's going to be for the next two weeks.
[01:38.64]We've got, I think, six microphones here to test.
[01:44.02]And whatever one sounds the best is the one that we're going to use for the next two weeks.
[01:48.54]We've got desk microphones.
[01:50.44]We've got headset microphones.
[01:55.19]We've even got goddamn karaoke microphones.
[01:58.09]You didn't think I was going to have one of these and test it?
[02:00.48]This might be the best one.
[02:01.49]I don't know.
[02:08.61]Ow.
[02:09.07]Really?
[02:09.55]Fuck.
[02:12.45]Am I still peaking?
[02:18.34]But Mike, this is the webcam, Mike.
[02:20.46]Don't hold on.
[02:21.22]Don't put your judgments up here yet.
[02:24.34]Turn it back.
[02:27.41]We have to get the definitive audio experience before I do any streaming.
[02:32.13]Before I do that, let's ruin the fucking computer.
[02:36.79]Speaking of computer, that peak?
[02:38.67]No.
[02:40.67]Those of you that want to see the new setup.
[02:43.23]Okay.
[02:43.43]What?
[02:45.17]What?
[02:45.61]What do you mean?
[02:47.49]Look.
[02:49.81]Speak up.
[02:50.21]All right.
[02:50.45]Well, here.
[02:50.79]That's fine.
[02:51.19]This is going to make a bunch of fucking noise.
[02:53.55]We're going to change microphones because I'm going to grab the webcam.
[02:57.19]So why don't we just... Why don't we try... Let's try the desk mic.
[03:02.25]How's that sound?
[03:04.71]We're on this one right here.
[03:05.73]This is the desk microphone.
[03:07.15]This is this one.
[03:08.69]How's that one sound?
[03:11.59]That one doesn't sound good?
[03:12.83]Well, hold on.
[03:13.61]Wait, wait, wait.
[03:14.10]Do you want to see the setup?
[03:15.62]Look.
[03:18.28]This is the kind of... This is the shit that we're dealing with now.
[03:22.72]I got my computer.
[03:25.70]This shit's on a card table.
[03:29.38]That's a card table.
[03:30.76]Keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
[03:32.90]There's the computer on the ground over here.
[03:35.94]And what's that over there?
[03:37.16]Oh, that's you guys.
[03:38.42]And it's on a chair.
[03:42.78]Not the best.
[03:47.59]Ready for Vegas?
[03:49.07]Almost.
[03:50.07]Not quite.
[03:51.29]All my shit is gone.
[03:52.25]The moving company took it today.
[03:54.83]All right, so you didn't like this one.
[03:56.43]Well, hold on one second.
[04:09.47]How's this one?
[04:11.03]Is this a little better?
[04:15.78]That's better?
[04:16.78]How's that now?
[04:18.76]This is like the gamer microphone.
[04:21.36]This is like the headset mic.
[04:23.48]Better?
[04:24.82]It's a little bit better?
[04:25.51]Yeah, this is the either airline pilot or video game player.
[04:35.51]All right, let's, ready?
[04:36.25]I'm going to give you just an either or or.
[04:38.57]Either or or.
[04:39.07]Okay, ready?
[04:40.45]Either.
[04:42.09]Or.
[04:43.71]Either.
[04:45.23]Or.
[04:47.27]Which one are we eliminating here?
[04:50.81]No, you got to just, this is, we're going to classify this one as small headset.
[04:55.75]Small headset.
[04:57.87]Okay.
[04:59.26]Let's take this other one, too.
[05:00.24]This is like a little bit bigger of a headset.
[05:03.38]For the purpose, no, it's got to be real.
[05:17.50]How do we sound now?
[05:20.34]We've evolved from basement gamer to esports ready.
[05:26.28]Bad, no, bad.
[05:29.47]The esports ready one is bad?
[05:30.83]Hold on.
[05:35.19]Watch, here we go.
[05:37.87]And not good.
[05:38.85]This one's apparently bad.
[05:40.97]Airplane.
[05:42.51]I hate the way I look in these.
[05:43.81]I hate wearing headphones because you look so stupid.
[05:46.66]I look stupid right now.
[05:51.92]Hold on.
[05:53.32]Alright.
[05:54.14]Everyone ready?
[05:56.20]These are both on at the same time.
[05:58.46]So... This is the small one.
[06:05.79]This is the large one.
[06:08.53]I'll make it even easier for you.
[06:09.61]We'll have this one go in your left ear.
[06:13.65]So this one... Hold on.
[06:19.01]Can I not do that?
[06:23.47]I don't think I... Can I not do... Hold on.
[06:24.75]I think I have to turn it off.
[06:42.68]I don't think I can move this to the other ear.
[06:47.76]I thought I could.
[06:49.70]Hold on.
[06:54.52]Why can't I put this in the other ear?
[06:55.60]No, we're not going to put them all on yet.
[06:59.29]Hold on.
[07:01.43]You want to put them all on?
[07:03.99]Okay, fine, guys.
[07:06.27]You want every fucking single microphone on?
[07:08.33]Are you sure you want that?
[07:12.39]Which one?
[07:12.89]Okay, so can you tell?
[07:14.91]Can you tell which one is the best?
[07:17.35]We didn't even do that.
[07:18.44]Hold on a second.
[07:19.00]What about this one?
[07:22.58]The small one's the best one?
[07:23.70]Hold on, we didn't do one more.
[07:27.48]Surround sound.
[07:28.14]Yeah, I'm trying to get it so that it's Dolby 5.1.
[07:30.14]Some of these have to be lower, some of them have to be higher for them to be surrounding your head.
[07:37.84]Hold on a second.
[07:39.08]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[07:40.08]This is the most important one.
[07:43.00]I got to plug this one in because I can't.
[09:40.39]Look, just so you guys can hear me fucking talk.
[09:42.85]Uh, I don't know why it's not picking this one up.
[09:46.76]God fucking idiot.
[09:52.03]Did I do- AHH!
[10:20.64]I'm so nervous about... There we go.
[10:24.28]There we are.
[10:26.72]Okay.
[10:29.06]Those of you students that think it's funny to throw rocks at the school bus, please refrain from doing so.
[10:36.01]It is really upsetting all the teachers and faculty.
[10:40.13]This is an assembly microphone.
[10:43.71]Just want to make sure that everybody's aware.
[10:46.55]that, yes, we have dealt with the school lunch problem.
[10:50.69]There is no longer E. coli in any of the food.
[10:53.89]I have personally tested it myself.
[10:57.68]How's this one?
[10:58.28]Should we use this one?
[11:02.18]Please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.
[11:06.20]The small one's the best?
[11:10.66]Okay.
[11:13.70]Oh, that's that.
[11:15.50]Why don't we have a celebratory drink?
[11:17.91]Hey, look, he's going to dump it in.
[11:19.09]I'm not going to dump it in.
[11:21.75]Make it more sensitive and it'll be better.
[11:28.91]Yes, that's correct, Russell.
[11:30.65]Kids, I drink here.
[11:31.59]I didn't even say it.
[11:37.22]I forgot to even say the thing.
[11:39.88]Congratulations on not moving yet.
[11:41.66]You filled up a storage unit.
[11:45.34]Ah, cheers, right?
[11:51.88]But anyways, let's talk about... I kind of like this one.
[11:58.37]This one makes me feel like I'm a performer.
[12:00.83]I'm on stage or something.
[12:03.37]Okay, so guys, a crazy thing happened the other day.
[12:05.71]Ah.
[12:16.47]Man, you know, moving.
[12:18.09]Moving sucks.
[12:19.39]How many here have moved before?
[12:20.91]How many of you have moved?
[12:21.67]A couple of you back there.
[12:24.19]Yeah.
[12:24.93]How the heck are we supposed to fill that thing up?
[12:27.71]You've got a storage unit that's nine feet deep.
[12:31.00]My couch is 12 feet long.
[12:33.00]What am I going to do, ship it with my aunt?
[12:35.32]Heaven forbid, don't put your dog in there.
[12:37.16]You know what I'm saying?
[12:38.54]Actually, don't do that, though.
[12:40.68]No, don't.
[12:41.20]Stop booing me.
[12:42.08]I'm saying don't put your dog in there.
[12:45.52]Should this be the whole stream?
[12:49.79]You know what's funny?
[12:52.63]You know what's funny?
[12:54.45]I actually had to sign an agreement that said... What's that?
[13:01.10]What's that, you fucking loser?
[13:03.80]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[13:04.82]You're here with your wicked, drunk, ugly-ass friends, huh?
[13:08.64]Yeah.
[13:09.48]Why don't you come up here and try?
[13:11.52]You think it's so easy.
[13:14.15]Oh, wait for you in the parking lot.
[13:16.46]Yeah, like you'll fit in that parking lot.
[13:18.30]You're like as big as the parking lot.
[13:20.84]Fucking loser.
[13:23.52]What do you want?
[13:24.64]Coming up here?
[13:28.30]I was on the website, right?
[13:31.41]I was on the website.
[13:33.83]And you actually have to sign an agreement that says you will not put an animal inside of the storage unit.
[13:39.85]Why do people like that?
[13:40.55]Isn't that funny?
[13:44.73]And this is the kind of quality that you can expect for the next two straight fucking weeks on this channel.
[13:51.64]Because I have nothing here.
[13:54.04]You've got me.
[13:55.47]That's it.
[13:58.25]And then another thing.
[13:59.31]Let's talk about this.
[14:01.45]I went to Target today.
[14:03.14]Hold on, wait.
[14:09.40]This is important.
[14:09.98]I need to get, like, a bunch of cheers.
[14:12.08]I need to get, like, a full-on laugh track here.
[14:14.65]The mic's too quiet?
[14:15.47]I'll take care of it.
[14:16.07]Hold on, hold on.
[14:19.15]People are going to be so fucking confused.
[14:20.97]They're going to think I'm some, like, loser.
[14:23.41]Like, hey, I'm starting my stand-up career on Twitch!
[14:27.75]In a fucking, like, bomb shelter!
[14:31.59]Hey, hey, welcome, guys!
[14:33.15]Alright, hold on.
[14:44.15]But anyways, let's talk for like real for a second Laughing audience, I'm not gonna be able to hear this so I don't know when the audience is gonna start laughing I'm gonna get like I'm gonna get cut off by a laughing audience I'm gonna like cue this up
[15:12.73]Alright.
[15:13.97]Somebody just wrote something freaking fucked up.
[15:17.07]Don't write anything that's fucked up, alright?
[15:18.93]Alright, hold on.
[15:20.39]I need to be able to hear this.
[15:22.74]Desktop audio needs to be on.
[15:24.20]It is.
[15:27.14]This is what we're doing, guys.
[15:28.84]Welcome to the stream.
[15:29.60]Okay, this one seems okay.
[15:38.04]Which one's plugged in?
[15:41.40]I don't know which headset it is because the audio is going through one of these headsets.
[15:45.22]There's no headset plugged in.
[15:47.24]I unplugged it.
[15:50.41]I unplugged the headset like a fucking idiot.
[15:53.13]Like, what an idiot.
[16:06.50]Is it playing?
[16:07.54]Wait, I don't understand.
[16:10.29]Why is it playing through here?
[16:11.37]All right, here we go.
[16:15.31]This is the right spot.
[16:32.46]Please welcome to the stage, Jeremy Albertson.
[16:38.31]Good to see you.
[16:39.73]So, how many people here are from Boston?
[16:43.47]How many?
[16:43.83]Yeah, one thing about Boston that you've got to remember.
[16:49.25]The roads.
[16:50.76]The roads, seriously.
[16:52.20]They're so hard to drive in.
[16:53.38]Remember how I was with my girlfriend?
[16:55.06]Stop laughing.
[16:55.74]I haven't done a joke.
[17:02.81]was that water was that a waterfall what the fuck why did that happen what's going on okay I it's going up my nose what happened here
[17:28.34]The microphone's too soft.
[17:30.43]There's nothing I can do about it.
[17:31.73]I think this thing broke.
[17:44.69]So how many people have you, how many of you drive cars?
[17:47.96]We all drive cars, we get behind the wheel, we start driving, and people say, oh, I was crashed into you, you know what I mean?
[17:55.24]No, I don't do that, but how many people have ever been hit by a car?
[18:00.44]Like, I mean, this is like not really that funny, but just I figured, you know, the reason I was late here today was because I actually got hit by a fucking car when I came in here.
[18:11.93]And I think I might have broken my fucking collarbone
[18:20.00]She said, well, I'm with Dave right now.
[18:29.51]I'm like, Dave?
[18:30.91]What?
[18:43.41]And she said, well, it's the guy that I'm seeing right now.
[18:45.47]And so that's why I was late.
[18:53.62]Anyways, how many of you guys have ever flown in an airplane?
[19:04.94]Yeah.
[19:06.43]You know what those snacks are?
[19:07.43]They go all over the place.
[19:18.80]I have to get off.
[19:19.33]I have to go.
[19:20.55]Bye.
[19:22.41]Too loud?
[19:23.39]What do you mean too loud?
[19:30.58]gentlemen, introducing Jeremy Albertson.
[19:34.52]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[19:35.49]How you doing?
[19:36.91]You, you, you.
[19:38.43]Hey, listen.
[19:39.69]I was at Target today, and there was this fat bitch in the front row in front of me at the checkout.
[19:44.46]You know what I'm saying?
[19:45.86]Yeah.
[19:51.00]See?
[19:51.78]I said, hey, excuse me.
[19:53.23]I swear to God, I'm not even kidding.
[19:54.75]She jacked up when I said, excuse me.
[19:56.25]And I heard, nip, nip, nip, nip.
[19:58.17]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[20:22.28]Do I have the right one?
[20:29.38]I got the right one now, don't I?
[20:36.55]What?
[20:36.77]I'm doing like the comedian.
[20:42.01]Hello?
[20:42.27]It's the wrong one.
[20:51.50]I should just play fucking Oblivion with the handheld one plugged in.
[20:59.05]I hope it's not loud.
[21:01.33]No, we're good.
[21:04.93]I can't believe this is the best one.
[21:06.07]This just goes to show you.
[21:07.33]Can you hear me?
[21:08.49]Oh, that one's still on.
[21:10.67]This honestly goes to show you, though.
[21:13.19]This is the cheapest one.
[21:13.93]This one was like $8.
[21:16.77]Sometimes cheaper is better.
[21:23.69]so yeah yeah hello this one was like eight bucks just snap it all right so um anyways I don't remember what we were doing actually good yeah this thing what brand is this so we can shout it out on stream I don't know it's here somewhere
[21:53.03]I don't know.
[21:53.39]I have no idea what brand this is.
[21:55.27]Let me look it up.
[21:58.11]Nice jokes.
[22:00.07]I think... Here it is.
[22:01.45]This is just... No, that's not the right one.
[22:10.85]Okay, this is the Walmart brand.
[22:15.62]This is actually just the $8 Walmart brand off the shelf.
[22:20.88]That Logitech was like 20 bucks.
[22:24.76]Listen to the crisp quality here.
[22:26.18]Alright, anyway, so this is what we're going to have to use for a while.
[22:29.33]Hopefully nobody's too upset about it.
[22:31.63]And speaking of playing games, I have to hold this on my lap.
[22:39.21]There's no way I can play it up there.
[22:43.55]There's no fucking way.
[22:46.23]How am I going to do this?
[22:48.90]Because watch what happens if I do this, if I use this up here.
[22:52.06]Like, it shakes the whole thing around.
[22:56.36]The door.
[22:58.80]Oh, that door?
[23:03.25]The little, like, Alice in Wonderland door?
[23:13.01]That's my bedroom.
[23:15.27]That's my bedroom.
[23:16.01]I got all my cool swag is in there.
[23:22.75]It's going to go to my bedroom.
[23:26.57]One second.
[23:28.05]Fuck.
[23:28.45]You guys want to see?
[23:37.07]It's pretty cool.
[23:46.63]It's messy in there.
[23:47.27]I don't think it's messy.
[24:03.83]Wait, could you even hear what I was saying?
[24:05.99]What's with my hair, too?
[24:07.23]My whole life is a fucking joke right now, guys.
[24:10.58]I swear to God.
[24:11.80]I fucking hate this.
[24:12.70]I'd rather hold it in my hand.
[24:14.76]Like this.
[24:16.64]I don't want to wear it.
[24:17.38]I feel like a dickhead with this on.
[24:22.57]I feel like I'm training to be something right now.
[24:24.95]Like, I feel like I shouldn't have this on.
[24:29.17]Me too.
[24:33.28]That's better.
[24:34.42]Now how am I going to hear the game?
[24:38.38]Shit, this sucks.
[24:41.44]Sell something?
[24:43.44]Sell something?
[24:43.88]What do you mean?
[24:45.58]I've been getting rid of shit.
[24:47.94]This is going to come off the ear here.
[24:49.11]There we go.
[24:49.47]Now I don't feel as bad.
[24:51.35]I feel like physically sick with this on.
[24:55.45]Did I ship my earbuds?
[24:56.69]I shipped everything.
[24:57.47]Everything is gone.
[25:01.49]Play Flash game.
[25:02.15]I don't know.
[25:02.41]We're going to play Oblivion.
[25:04.84]But once... We're just hanging out for... I haven't even told you guys what happened.
[25:10.04]You know what I mean?
[25:11.12]I haven't even told... I'm not doing that joke because I'll ruin the mic and I need this for two weeks.
[25:16.46]I'm not doing that.
[25:18.48]How do you drink with this on?
[25:20.54]Those of you guys that have this shit.
[25:23.61]Those of you dudes that have a headset like this.
[25:26.55]If you're left-handed, how do you drink?
[25:31.19]Like, how does this work?
[25:35.32]That's stupid.
[25:36.90]What?
[25:39.00]Hold on.
[25:39.32]I'll get it like this.
[25:41.22]Because then if I do it like this, now it's, like, going to cover my eye.
[25:50.23]I want a hands-free, mouth-free environment.
[25:53.07]All right.
[25:53.33]So let's talk about something real quick before we play.
[25:59.67]That's better.
[26:01.84]Move it further out.
[26:02.56]Yeah, but you have to go, like, you have to get your own personal, like, mouth door to take a sip of something.
[26:11.92]All right.
[26:15.21]So.
[26:19.26]My brain is kind of fried right now.
[26:22.02]I've had about three hours of sleep for the last three days.
[26:24.06]That's right.
[26:25.60]Well, I mean, three hours, three hours.
[26:27.00]Six hours total.
[26:28.08]No, that's nine hours.
[26:29.88]This thing's vising my brain.
[26:31.44]I can't think.
[26:34.38]I've had three hours of sleep.
[26:36.30]Everything's gone.
[26:38.38]And it's kind of just putting pieces together and throwing shit in the trash.
[26:42.00]Or donating it.
[26:43.50]I'm not in Vegas yet.
[26:46.26]You know, it's really, like, sad.
[26:48.29]Because...
[26:50.03]Like, all of my most important life shit went into this, like, storage, went into this, like, moving company thing.
[26:57.10]So, I mean, it was kind of, it was very, very scary.
[27:00.80]It's like my child going to college.
[27:03.76]Except instead of saying goodbye and giving a hug and wave, bye-bye, it's like, that kid, I stuffed all my children in the back of a van.
[27:12.56]Like, in the back of a fucking 18-wheeler, and they drove away.
[27:14.76]I'm like, are they safe in there?
[27:17.21]It's my child.
[27:17.95]It's my children in there.
[27:22.18]I have anxiety right now about it.
[27:27.42]I shipped my kids in that fucking thing.
[27:30.26]It doesn't feel right.
[27:32.18]I want to drive with it, but I just couldn't do it.
[27:34.62]You're going to get that.
[27:41.17]Wait, could you even hear that with this one?
[27:43.63]You might have been able to.
[27:48.23]I bet you, like, I bet you, like, $50 million to myself.
[27:53.05]Hey, thanks, man.
[27:53.55]Thanks for the bet.
[27:54.21]Yeah, you're welcome, dude.
[27:55.49]Hey, Jeremy, I bet you $50 million you're going to hear, like, MasterChef up there, like, through the ground.
[28:01.80]Anyone want to take that bet?
[28:02.76]I already did.
[28:09.10]Bet jokes?
[28:13.44]No, not bet jokes.
[28:14.26]Should I stand back up again?
[28:15.56]Should I get back up?
[28:16.18]Should I get on stage again?
[28:24.32]No.
[28:26.99]Somebody's texting me too.
[28:29.47]But it's finally done.
[28:32.75]And we can move on to play Oblivion here.
[28:37.33]No, I'm not the infomercial guy.
[28:38.53]I'm the infomercial guy that goes and does a live show at a trade show or at your local fair.
[28:45.15]The guy that has the thing here and he's showing off like a blender at like the county fair.
[28:50.17]And there's four people sitting in the 50 fucking available seats.
[28:55.98]At some point you kind of just have to like, I would just start putting random shit in there.
[28:59.24]I'd put like tomatoes and like grapefruits and onions and just blend it up and pretend like it was good.
[29:04.72]There's a spooky thing blinking behind you.
[29:07.76]What?
[29:08.76]That?
[29:11.90]It's a spooky thing.
[29:13.54]No, guys, I'm in a basement right now.
[29:19.22]That's an anti-electric static field, uh, de-stimulator, so it has to stay on.
[29:26.12]That is going to be, like, blinking, though, isn't it?
[29:30.97]Was it auto?
[29:31.43]Auto was upstairs.
[29:33.55]You really gonna make me prove that I didn't put my dog in a fucking moving van?
[29:38.56]Why would I do something that absurdly horrible?
[29:41.68]No, he's coming on the plane.
[29:45.50]He's coming on the plane.
[29:46.60]You guys are fucking crazy.
[29:51.34]Alright, how long have we been... 30 minutes have gone by.
[29:56.04]Let's talk about the future, okay?
[29:58.30]Here's what's gonna happen in the future.
[30:01.79]Tonight is the only stream for the next couple days.
[30:05.44]My birthday is tomorrow.
[30:09.48]Happy birthday to me.
[30:11.74]I forgot it was my birthday, by the way.
[30:14.00]I had no idea.
[30:17.20]I'm not doing anything from I'm there's a couple friends that were with going to do something easy but I forgot was my birthday until like four hours ago so I turned 28 28 years old that's how it works right then you press X because he saw my eyes go over here old actually 33 so
[30:44.65]I don't know, man.
[30:46.31]I look pretty good for 33.
[30:49.53]I mean, like, if I stood up right now, you'd see, like, that's a pretty good-looking 33-year-old.
[30:59.57]I'm a baby boomer?
[31:00.65]No, not quite.
[31:01.47]I'm still a millennial.
[31:04.33]1835.
[31:04.49]Yeah, but, Dad, this happened recently.
[31:10.91]Like, I didn't do that.
[31:13.38]this just kind of it showed up I didn't do it I don't eat bad food I just it just happened something something happened 18 to 35 18 35 that's millennial careful standing on your chair shut up
[31:41.18]So, today we're going to play Oblivion.
[31:43.10]Yeah, I'm going to get off the camera.
[31:44.50]I'll stop embarrassing myself real soon here, I promise.
[31:48.11]And then... I'll stop embarrassing myself really soon.
[31:59.57]You just hear like...
[32:09.94]You're going to hear weird shit.
[32:11.66]I'm telling you.
[32:13.97]That's me.
[32:14.75]No, it's not you.
[32:15.53]But Oblivion tonight.
[32:18.19]Maybe Oblivion Monday.
[32:21.55]I still have my PlayStation 4.
[32:23.97]So we play God of War maybe?
[32:26.35]I have no idea.
[32:32.64]By the way, you're going to get a girl talking to Otto for the next 45 minutes.
[32:39.30]Yes, please.
[32:40.14]God of War is the other option.
[32:44.89]Otto wants to be on stream.
[32:46.05]No, he doesn't.
[32:47.67]He doesn't.
[32:51.53]That mic is not that strong.
[32:52.71]Well, that's good.
[32:53.41]It's concentrated right into my mouth.
[32:57.42]But uh Oblivion, let's transition now and then the green screen stream.
[33:02.42]So here's what's going to happen for the green screen stream, a lot of people are confused what the hell I'm doing with that.
[33:05.00]I'm going to go to- I'm not just going to put a green screen back here and stand in front of it and you know go like this: Oh, he's dancing that's like a disco thing.
[33:14.00]I'm not going to do that. I refuse to do that, I won't do that.
[33:18.00]So I'm going to be going to a green screen studio where I'll be able to sprint around in a gigantic green screen.
[33:28.13]I'm going to bring all kinds of weird props.
[33:34.61]It's going to be the real deal.
[33:38.17]So there's going to be tons of footage.
[33:39.80]And we'll talk about in more detail what that actually means in the coming three or four days.
[33:47.12]Please bring a taco.
[33:49.30]Why the hell would I do that?
[33:52.57]yeah it's good the whole thing it's uh I looked up like where I'll be going there's like there's like weirdly enough there's no film studios in massachusetts or in the boston area but for some fucked up reason there's like green screen studios like oh we don't have any like actual like warehouses or studio space but hey you need a giant fucking green screen room come on down
[34:19.06]You know what it probably is?
[34:19.94]It's because a lot of them are syndicated with the news, I think.
[34:23.59]And some of these, I think, are like weatherman stations.
[34:26.97]Where the weatherman stands and he can sprint back and forth.
[34:30.99]How much do you have to pay for that shit?
[34:35.92]I think it's like... It's more than $1,000.
[34:38.84]I don't know how much more, though.
[34:40.22]It's worth it, though.
[34:43.22]It's worth it for me to do a full sprint from one end to the other.
[34:48.84]I'm like spending so much money moving.
[34:51.22]I'm going to be like broke in 30 days.
[34:54.66]It's worth it.
[34:56.60]Just buy a green screen.
[34:57.50]No, because I won't be able to sprint from one side of the room to the other.
[35:01.38]That's worth $1,000 to me.
[35:02.30]And I want to be able to fully swing like a sword standing head to feet.
[35:15.66]You know what I mean?
[35:16.10]Like, I want head and feet in this frame.
[35:18.76]Like, attacking, swinging, and doing flips and stuff.
[35:24.99]Because, you know, if I put it back here, it won't key out great.
[35:35.07]I've spent more money on stupid shit before.
[35:38.22]You guys know that.
[35:43.88]$1,000 to stand in front of a green screen with a taco.
[35:48.33]Where are you getting that?
[35:53.21]Buying green screen material and plastering your walls is probably cheaper.
[35:58.15]I can't do that here.
[36:00.07]This place, I'm out of here very, very soon.
[36:02.12]I can't, like, fuck it all up.
[36:03.76]I've fucked this place up already a shitload of times.
[36:08.98]My realtor grabbed me by the shirt and ripped me in and was like, don't fucking do any more dumb jokes in those rooms.
[36:14.80]And I'm like, Jesus!
[36:17.32]So I gotta listen.
[36:22.32]You're moving again?
[36:23.19]Yep, I'm in Vegas right now.
[36:25.29]Decided I didn't like it, so we're moving from Vegas to Utah.
[36:32.71]What's under the stairs?
[36:36.76]that's my room and then that's my dad's room that one that's my bedroom and my dad's bedroom and the one down there is a guest room under the stairs there is no room there that's it that's the whole thing I think I did I just I didn't just do that did I did I just click the fucking button to turn the computer off with my toe I'm gonna be so pissed off
[37:12.38]Okay, I think we're okay.
[37:13.74]I definitely touched it, and it made a clicking sound.
[37:18.56]The right door is... This is all fairyland storage.
[37:26.54]I want to go flick the light just to prove that it works.
[37:28.96]Why would I do that?
[37:29.86]Who cares?
[37:30.72]I don't give a shit if the light doesn't work.
[37:32.50]Why would I be concerned if you cared about that?
[37:37.06]Alright.
[37:38.62]Let's play a video game as much as I can.
[37:43.39]This is going to be such a fucking disaster.
[37:45.27]I can already tell.
[37:46.09]I'm going to give up and we're going to just sit here and make shitty jokes.
[37:54.99]I don't even know if... Oblivion might not even load.
[37:57.23]This will be interesting.
[38:01.39]Take us to the wardrobe?
[38:02.41]Alright, let's see if I can even... Let's just... Hold on.
[38:09.30]This is important.
[38:10.97]Does the audio actually sound okay if I get louder?
[38:13.21]If I'm like, whoa, a monster!
[38:14.43]Is that too much?
[38:16.19]Or like, whoa, a monster.
[38:17.01]Fuck.
[38:20.87]It's fine?
[38:21.37]Okay.
[38:23.81]Why am I holding this like a pizza?
[38:24.75]Am I going to have to hold it like this and move?
[38:28.54]No, it's going to have to sit like this.
[38:32.38]I'm going to be sitting back here.
[38:33.58]Should I get the whole body here?
[38:38.96]I think that makes it funner.
[38:44.23]Alright, let's open up... I can... Wait a minute, dudes.
[38:46.85]Wait a minute, dudes.
[38:48.87]I can do this.
[38:52.55]And sit all the way back here and not have to worry about microphone shit.
[38:56.87]This is kind of cool.
[39:00.63]I actually kind of like this.
[39:02.39]I don't have to worry about anything.
[39:05.16]This is great.
[39:06.12]Alright.
[39:10.18]Where is Oblivion?
[39:11.18]Hold on.
[39:12.94]I gotta, like, turn...
[39:24.48]Okay, can somebody tell me please that I can move?
[39:31.24]Is this going to work?
[39:34.20]Wait, I got to make sure it's not going to be super loud, like crazy loud.
[39:37.34]All right, tell me if you can see it because this has to go over here now.
[39:44.60]I'm dropping frames too.
[39:45.95]I'm so glad I'm out of here in like 11 days.
[39:48.17]Steam.
[39:51.65]Steam.
[39:57.66]I look like jacked in that little thumbnail there.
[40:00.90]God, I'm keeping it.
[40:02.12]What happened?
[40:04.70]What happened?
[40:05.54]What was that for?
[40:06.08]Alright.
[40:11.46]I don't even know what's on this computer.
[40:12.78]I installed it.
[40:13.58]The save files are here.
[40:19.35]Doesn't it look like I'm trying way too hard right now?
[40:23.41]It's because I'm leaning back.
[40:31.56]Alright, Oblivion.
[40:34.14]Almost there.
[40:35.81]How am I supposed to drink my drink?
[40:38.11]And by the way, this monitor is tiny.
[40:39.83]I can't see.
[40:41.23]I can't see from this far away.
[40:45.13]I can't see any of the Steam game names.
[40:48.98]There it is.
[40:49.42]The Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
[40:53.64]There it is.
[41:01.16]I'm going to turn the difficulty to as low as it can go, by the way.
[41:04.56]Because there's no way I'm going to be able to play like this.
[41:09.53]Steam, why are you the worst service ever now?
[41:13.63]Why can't I get... Oh, who cares?
[41:16.05]Can you see it?
