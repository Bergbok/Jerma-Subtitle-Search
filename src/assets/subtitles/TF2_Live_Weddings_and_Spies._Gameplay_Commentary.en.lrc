[00:09.96]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:11.00]Jeremy here.
[00:11.48]Gonna do a live commentary tonight.
[00:14.28]Gonna be real relaxed, real laid back with this one.
[00:16.72]Got a lot of things on my mind, and we'll talk about them very, very briefly.
[00:20.49]Nothing too big, don't worry.
[00:21.83]Nothing crazy, guys.
[00:23.09]It's just the fact that I have a wedding that I'm the best man of.
[00:27.33]Is that a spy?
[00:27.99]Although, whatever.
[00:30.21]I'm gonna be the best man at my brother's wedding in two days, and I have to make a speech and everything, and that's not what I'm concerned about.
[00:36.06]It's just...
[00:37.35]It's weird, people growing up.
[00:39.43]Friends, family.
[00:41.07]It's really odd.
[00:42.21]And it's not really depressing, but it's something that's in the back of my mind now.
[00:47.10]It's just odd.
[00:48.18]Don't know really what to say about it, but it's going to be a great, fun, exciting day.
[00:52.14]And hopefully it turns out... Whoa, is that a cake on the ground?
[00:57.62]The TF2 birthday stuff.
[00:59.17]Okay, I get it.
[01:00.33]How did that not hit?
[01:01.51]Oh my god, dude, he's standing still.
[01:03.18]Yeah, I got, oh god.
[01:05.72]So I have a wedding, and it should be a lot of fun.
[01:08.66]It's just really weird seeing your family grow up, and seeing your friends grow up around you.
[01:14.46]Some of you guys are too young to realize what I'm talking about, but some of you guys are a little older.
[01:19.65]And you'll know what I'm talking about soon enough.
[01:22.65]Watching everybody get married, watching everybody around you.
[01:26.58]But this is a live comm.
[01:28.46]I wanted to do it, wanted to get it out here tonight.
[01:30.73]Because I'm not going to be able to do a video, obviously, in the next couple days.
[01:33.55]Because we're leaving tomorrow.
[01:35.49]So I wanted to... I didn't even mean to do that.
[01:38.65]Oh, come on.
[01:40.37]Oh.
[01:41.21]No.
[01:41.77]Get the assist.
[01:44.43]This is on Gold Rush.
[01:45.17]This is on Lepter's server.
[01:47.33]Technically, it's mine and Lepter's server.
[01:48.89]But Lepter's really the executive producer of this server.
[01:52.05]Are you a spy?
[01:52.99]Yes, you are.
[01:54.49]Oh, get caught in that.
[01:55.69]Oh.
[01:57.32]Yeah, Lepter's in this game, so Lepter, if you're watching, what's up, dude?
[02:00.32]There you are.
[02:03.28]Oh, come on.
[02:04.56]Come on.
[02:08.74]Oh, come on.
[02:11.99]So yeah, that's mainly what I wanted to talk about, is the fact that brother's getting married.
[02:18.39]And I'm scared.
[02:22.69]Give me some ammo.
[02:26.06]Plain as a Demoman.
[02:27.00]Just because I feel like it.
[02:29.94]A lot of people just got... A lot of spies on our team, huh?
[02:32.34]Well, not really.
[02:32.90]Only two.
[02:33.60]Seven on seven.
[02:35.30]A lot of spies in general.
[02:36.48]Let me catch somebody with one of these.
[02:41.04]Let me catch somebody with this.
[02:43.25]Oh, come here.
[02:44.61]Come here now.
[02:45.13]Oh, yeah.
[02:47.31]Oh, oh, oh.
[02:48.21]This is a battle of wits.
[02:50.19]A battle of wits right here.
[02:51.19]Oh, I got it.
[02:52.93]You're done.
[02:54.03]Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:57.34]Admirable, admirable attempt, though, my friend.
[02:59.58]I thought you were going to get me.
[03:02.46]So birthday cakes, this is Valve's birthday, I guess this is their.
[03:05.29]Well, not today, but it was.
[03:08.11]Oh, boy.
[03:10.89]Oh, come on.
[03:11.61]I'm going to die.
[03:12.99]Nope.
[03:16.90]There we go.
[03:18.10]Get some stickies out.
[03:20.50]See if I can't catch somebody coming around this corner.
[03:24.72]And also, I'm still working on the live streaming, guys.
[03:26.57]I'm still working on getting that ready, getting that out to go.
[03:29.49]I've had a lot of tips from a couple of dudes.
[03:32.77]Oh, my God, get away from me.
[03:35.17]Oh, that was Lepter.
[03:37.41]Lepter, you're a real son of a bitch.
[03:43.25]I'm live-comming, by the way, so... If you don't know Lepter, you should.
[03:53.49]Get off that cart.
[03:57.06]Oh, come on.
[03:58.58]Nice.
[03:59.22]Nice.
[04:02.35]Oh, question is, can I finish him off?
[04:04.93]Question is, can I finish him off?
[04:07.15]Question is, can I... No, I'm not going to be able to do this, guys.
[04:11.43]Somebody left in the comments before, they said, we want to see you fail, because you never show gameplays where you fail.
[04:18.95]And usually in my live stuff, I don't do too great.
[04:24.92]I usually get beat up pretty hardcore in my live commentaries.
[04:29.52]Because I have a problem with doing two things at once.
[04:33.75]My brain can't really function that well when I have to do two things at once.
[04:36.85]So if I have to talk, then I have to talk.
[04:40.64]If I have to play, then I have to play.
[04:43.06]And why am I just letting him get away with this?
[04:48.48]So pretty much when I speak, I can't play.
[04:51.61]And when I play, I can't speak.
[04:53.65]It's kind of my mind is one track.
[04:55.89]And that's a... Oh, come on now.
[04:57.75]You're a spy.
[04:58.85]Come on.
[05:00.41]Yeah, great.
[05:01.23]Nice job.
[05:02.05]Nice job, spy.
[05:04.99]God.
[05:07.21]Oh, can I finish him off?
[05:08.75]I couldn't do it last time.
[05:11.25]Oh, son of a B. Here we go.
[05:14.41]Four more minutes, lads.
[05:18.23]Let's get some... Oh, that's... I think that's Lepter right there.
[05:23.28]Oh, I missed.
[05:24.17]He did too, though.
[05:26.53]Oh, God.
[05:28.62]Nice.
[05:29.38]Nice shot.
[05:33.84]But if anybody else in the comments could just let me know if you had, like, a family member get married.
[05:39.60]My sister got married a couple years ago.
[05:41.72]But what was your experience with somebody in your family getting married or somebody that you know, a close friend getting married or something?
[05:49.01]I'd really like to know because it's really interesting to me.
[05:52.67]No, they're going to win.
[05:53.37]Uh-oh.
[05:57.03]Oh.
[05:58.37]Better get these on the cart.
[06:04.19]3 minutes and 57 seconds.
[06:05.39]The question is, can we do it?
[06:09.16]Doesn't really look like it.
[06:10.16]It looks like they're getting pretty close to winning.
[06:12.84]What do we got right now?
[06:14.20]Actually, we're doing alright.
[06:21.21]Ugh.
[06:21.79]Spy.
[06:23.63]Fine.
[06:23.99]You want to play that game?
[06:25.29]Where'd you go?
[06:28.75]God damn it.
[06:30.45]I knew that was going to happen.
[06:33.51]I knew that was going to happen.
[06:35.29]Like, I guaranteed myself coming around that corner.
[06:39.07]Somebody, two scouts on the cart.
[06:41.01]Somebody do something.
[06:43.78]Oh, can I help?
[06:46.50]Kaboom.
[06:47.52]By the way, see my new hat?
[06:48.52]If you didn't see my new hat, I'll show you.
[06:50.84]I finally got the towering pillar of hats.
[06:53.40]It is the stupidest, most funny, entertaining thing in the game, I think.
[06:57.89]And I'm so glad that I finally have this really dumb hat.
[07:03.89]The thing is, I hate when people wear this hat.
[07:05.69]It's so obnoxious.
[07:07.59]It's just like, dude, will you take that thing off?
[07:09.32]That thing's annoying.
[07:13.76]What?
[07:14.32]Oh.
[07:14.58]I was going to say, lag, huh?
[07:22.49]But yeah, I'm still working on the livestream thing, guys.
[07:24.53]And my first game that I'm going to livestream is probably going to be, obviously, TF2.
[07:31.15]The other game is probably going to be Deus Ex.
[07:34.38]Because I bought Deus Ex.
[07:35.80]I was really, really raring to go to play Deus Ex.
[07:38.88]And now I have it, and I haven't played it yet.
[07:40.44]So I figured that's a good outlet for it.
[07:43.10]And if you guys don't want that, let me know.
[07:44.70]Because I will take it into consideration.
[07:47.64]But it's definitely something I want to do.
[07:48.82]My livestream, I think I want it to be...
[07:51.78]Because some of you might remember, a lot of you newer subscribers don't remember, but about three or four weeks ago, I came out with a new Let's Play series of The Witcher 2.
[08:00.65]And it didn't really go over so well with people.
[08:04.39]Didn't really get too many views.
[08:05.55]I can understand, because I know that people don't want to sit through a freaking 500-hour game and all these cutscenes and stuff.
[08:13.93]But I figured, what a good place for a live stream to do that.
[08:17.68]So if you guys don't mind, during my livestream, hopefully I can play some of those games and you won't be too annoyed.
[08:24.16]Oh boy, Uber right off the bait.
[08:25.24]Right out of the gate.
[08:27.46]Oh, where'd it go?
[08:28.02]Where'd the Uber go?
[08:28.58]There it is.
[08:32.58]Oh, that was... I don't think they had a sentry gun, so... I'm not going to call that a fail Uber.
[08:37.68]Yeah, they only have a level 1.
[08:40.26]That's not a fail Uber.
[08:42.49]Maybe it was, but, you know...
[08:45.44]Like I said, talking and playing at the same time.
[08:47.86]Live comms are not my strong point, but they are a lot of fun.
[08:50.76]Because you get to see the real, raw Jerma.
[08:55.35]Oh, by the way, speaking of my videos, Jerma, whatever.
[08:59.53]Go watch the video that's up on Pixel Enemy right now, guys.
[09:01.71]It's out there now.
[09:02.69]Scout, Milkman, it's getting a pretty good response so far.
[09:04.81]So hopefully you guys enjoy that.
[09:07.77]Oh boy, I heard stab.
[09:08.67]Yes, I knew it.
[09:09.23]I knew it.
[09:10.68]No!
[09:11.48]I'm going... No, God!
[09:13.43]No!
[09:15.47]Oh, wow.
[09:16.01]I can't believe I... Hey, this is a tip for you guys.
[09:21.55]Especially for those new guys.
[09:23.77]If you are on a cart, or you're on a point, and you hear a stabbing sound, if you hear that, like, it sounds like a... Make sure to turn around, because most of the time, that's somebody getting stabbed on your team.
[09:36.06]So, listen for that.
[09:37.34]Listen for that stabbing noise.
[09:41.31]Oh, my God.
[09:42.17]Getting owned.
[09:44.11]What am I?
[09:44.45]11 and 10.
[09:45.99]One for one.
[09:47.87]Whatever.
[09:49.19]I'm having fun.
[09:49.81]I think we'll be at 8 on 7.
[09:54.07]Playing with my boy Lepter.
[09:57.12]And let's see.
[09:57.78]We've got to move this cart.
[10:01.04]We've got to move to get this cart moving.
[10:03.02]There we go.
[10:05.52]Oh, no.
[10:07.06]Don't you dare.
[10:09.36]Don't you dare.
[10:11.27]Give me the help.
[10:12.25]Nice.
[10:12.79]Oh, come on.
[10:13.71]Come on.
[10:16.47]What?
[10:16.75]He just got backstabbed by nothing.
[10:19.25]Did you guys see that?
[10:21.55]If you're watching right now, go back like five seconds to when that soldier just got backstabbed.
[10:27.02]Nothing.
[10:27.68]He didn't get hit by anybody.
[10:28.84]He just magically died from a backstab.
[10:32.60]Oh, I better sticky jump.
[10:37.34]Oh, God.
[10:37.72]This is nonsense.
[10:38.48]Hear that stab?
[10:39.66]There he is.
[10:41.34]Oh, I didn't save the medic.
[10:42.86]Oh my god.
[10:44.00]Oh my god.
[10:45.44]Wow.
[10:47.47]Oh my goodness.
[10:48.85]And now I'm the only one left.
[10:50.79]And then there was one.
[10:53.85]Oh, Christ.
[10:55.89]Oh, I'm done.
[10:56.77]Might as well just sacrifice myself.
[11:00.83]You know, let's... I need an engineer.
[11:04.17]An engineer is my favorite class, as you know.
[11:06.14]What do I got for a loadout right now?
[11:10.17]No, I don't want to use that.
[11:12.63]Stick with this.
[11:15.20]Actually, you know what?
[11:16.64]Why not?
[11:17.12]I'm going to use it.
[11:19.20]It's not what I really want to do, but... Not very many gameplays with this thing, so... I figured, why not?
[11:24.94]I'll try it.
[11:25.40]I've got the spies.
[11:27.70]Oh, boy.
[11:35.37]Oh, boy.
[11:35.81]That thing...
[11:36.70]Wow, that thing's really bad.
[11:38.58]That thing is really bad.
[11:42.64]Man.
[11:44.82]Wow, I shot twice.
[11:46.12]I didn't... I mean, I hit him.
[11:47.45]I'm going to have to look back at that and see how much ammo I actually got.
[11:52.31]That was really bad.
[11:54.73]Wow.
[11:56.59]Oh, somebody got a collateral.
[11:58.03]I got to get like a meat shot on somebody.
[12:03.69]That's not going to work.
[12:05.58]No.
[12:06.48]I'm just gonna get myself killed.
[12:10.29]Oh, come on.
[12:10.95]You're gonna do me like that?
[12:11.71]You're gonna do me like that?
[12:12.71]Oh, this is... You know what?
[12:15.91]Forget it.
[12:16.53]Not working out.
[12:17.39]I'm not even gonna pretend like I'm gonna try and use this thing.
[12:20.57]I said there's a... Oh, nobody does this.
[12:22.47]There's no gameplays of this thing.
[12:24.32]Maybe that's because it sucks.
[12:28.26]They'll buff it, don't worry.
[12:30.49]Watch out spy, spy spawn, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[12:33.01]I got you.
[12:33.61]I saved you.
[12:34.27]I saved you, Johnny.
[12:37.56]Not really, because he was a Dead Ringer, so.
[12:41.76]Oh, you're done.
[12:42.98]You're going to come around that corner and you're going to get yourself killed.
[12:46.08]I told you.
[12:47.34]Give me that crit.
[12:49.84]Spy, just bumped into a spy.
[12:54.33]Can we just please win this game?
[12:55.83]Oh my god.
[12:58.77]That's not a good place for that.
[12:59.79]It has to go right here.
[13:03.29]Oh, get killed.
[13:04.53]Nice.
[13:06.86]Destroy it.
[13:07.88]Put it right back.
[13:09.02]Oh, come on!
[13:10.50]Come on!
[13:11.10]Are you serious?
[13:13.44]You all saw that.
[13:14.60]That was not a bad... Oh, God.
[13:20.82]Alright, well... Might as well put a teleporter down.
[13:26.18]That's probably gonna get sapped and destroyed anyways.
[13:28.64]Not like it matters.
[13:33.60]Oh, come on.
[13:34.16]What the?
[13:35.56]No assist?
[13:37.68]Crap.
[13:38.84]Oh my god!
[13:39.56]Leave me alone!
[13:42.16]You know what?
[13:42.78]You're dead.
[13:43.83]I'm gonna punch you in the face.
[13:47.17]God damn it!
[13:51.87]I got a Pyro on the team.
[13:54.55]Oh, whatever.
[13:57.95]Oh, this is not looking so good.
[13:59.37]So here you go.
[14:02.65]Livecom.
[14:03.93]Me getting my ass kicked.
[14:09.03]Now I could just stop talking and probably play ten times better.
[14:13.19]But, as you know, that's not the fun of a livecom.
[14:18.33]Alright, I can't be an engineer.
[14:20.04]I gotta be a power class.
[14:21.36]This is not working out.
[14:23.72]I got to be a power class.
[14:24.60]This is not working out at all.
[14:26.70]Oh, sawmill.
[14:31.12]Power class.
[14:31.80]Let's do it.
[14:33.68]Oh, for the love of God.
[14:35.03]They have right at this spawn camping.
[14:39.07]Oh, man.
[14:43.89]Okay, time to change this.
[14:45.87]Alright.
[14:47.49]Okay, got the scout.
[14:52.05]Where is he?
[14:52.55]Where is he?
[14:55.71]No, no.
[14:56.35]Alright, they're gone.
[15:00.95]Where's that spy?
[15:02.19]Keep running into him.
[15:03.59]Spy at spawn.
[15:04.41]Be careful, guys.
[15:08.71]Oh, crap.
[15:09.81]I can get it.
[15:10.43]Yeah, we got it.
[15:12.13]It's all good.
[15:14.47]Get out of here, dude.
[15:17.87]Somebody has to kill that guy.
[15:20.86]Pyro time.
[15:22.68]You saw it here.
[15:23.50]You saw it here first, guys.
[15:25.51]Jerma rage pyros.
[15:27.13]Rage pyro.
[15:29.55]Alright, let's do it.
[15:33.27]Let's go with the default.
[15:34.39]Default flamethrower.
[15:36.39]Default shotgun.
[15:39.37]I'm going to do it like this.
[15:42.19]I'm doing it like this right now.
[15:43.80]Yeah, we're doing it like this now.
[15:48.94]Oh, the question is, yeah, he's going to kill me.
[15:51.48]No, you're a spy again.
[15:55.21]Spies all over the place.
[15:56.39]So what was that?
[15:59.79]Four classes in five minutes?
[16:02.33]Jerma, get it together here.
[16:10.16]Jeez.
[16:10.94]Medic, come with me.
[16:12.70]We'll make this happen.
[16:14.64]What the hell?
[16:15.68]Oh my god!
[16:18.41]Dude!
[16:21.79]Oh, I would play... No, I... This is... Alright, whatever.
[16:28.49]We are getting absolutely dominated right now.
[16:30.67]This is just... This is just ugly.
[16:32.66]This is really ugly.
[16:35.62]Yeah, get out of here.
[16:36.76]Get out of town, buddy.
[16:43.33]Check for spies.
[16:44.23]Yeah, get out of here.

[17:55.67]Wow.
[17:57.49]This is bad.
[17:59.76]Don't matter.
[18:00.20]Because I'm going to get out here right now, and I'm going to win the game.

[19:15.55]I betcha it's at least like a couple... I betcha it's at least a dozen times I've died from that spy.
[19:20.25]Same spy.
