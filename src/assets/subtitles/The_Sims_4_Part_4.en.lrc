[00:04.28]Why, hello there.
[00:05.26]How are you?
[00:07.38]How you doing?
[00:11.49]Moving the ice cube around in my drink.
[00:13.21]Hold on.
[00:15.99]This is a big ice cube.
[00:18.99]I like big ice cubes, though.
[00:23.66]Who cares?
[00:24.08]Hi, welcome to another stream.
[00:25.46]Me, Jerma.
[00:26.90]How you doing?
[00:27.28]How you doing?
[00:36.62]How big are the ice cubes?
[00:38.32]Alright, the best part about a huge ice cube is it takes so long to melt that it doesn't dilute your drink.
[00:45.29]How do I feel?
[00:45.77]Okay, so I feel... Let me go over my sort of COVID story, I guess.
[00:55.15]So, I think I'm over it.
[00:59.17]I have to test again to see if I'm still kind of shedding the virus.
[01:03.06]But I lost my sense of taste and smell for a little while, which that's scary.
[01:07.00]Because who knows with that, right?
[01:10.66]I'm still a little sloppy.
[01:12.00]I would say I'm not sick anymore.
[01:15.84]I have a residual cough, like kind of deep in my throat, in my kind of chest area.
[01:20.48]But I wouldn't say that I am sick.
[01:23.80]I was sick.
[01:25.22]I'm definitely over it, but maybe not completely.
[01:29.15]Yeah, I just kind of feel sloppy.
[01:35.72]But yeah, I'm doing better.
[01:38.18]And here we are.
[01:39.32]We are going to do a couple things today.
[01:41.92]Well, one.
[01:44.28]I have a very important thing to talk about with Origen.
[01:47.92]I told you, and everyone thought I was crazy, but it was true.
[01:52.48]So, today we're going to play The Sims 4.
[01:55.20]No mods.
[01:56.76]No additional modded content.
[02:00.18]And there's a couple of reasons why.
[02:03.25]Every single time I've played The Sims on stream, an hour goes by and people start killing each other.
[02:10.47]That's every single one of my streams for The Sims.
[02:14.86]So...
[02:16.49]I've never really experienced any of these expansions.
[02:21.07]And I got a lot of them.
[02:21.81]I have almost everything.
[02:24.45]So if I have the mods installed, I'm going to be tempted to use them.
[02:30.45]And that includes like the funny faces mods.
[02:33.22]I want to do a vanilla Sims 4 with every expansion play.
[02:39.46]I won't.
[02:40.38]I can't ever do it.
[02:42.87]It's like playing GTA, and you get through the second or third story mission, and then you just start doing the cheats.
[02:51.43]And you don't even play the rest of the game.
[02:53.29]You just run around and just fly around with the mods and stuff.
[02:57.01]You don't even play the game.
[03:00.37]This man doesn't know that non-murder mods exist.
[03:03.52]I know, but... I cannot install the drug mod yet.
[03:11.65]Which, by the way, and I will say this, the hardest I've ever laughed ever that I've ever streamed.
[03:18.90]You want to know the one time, I think I've said it before, the hardest I've ever laughed on stream to a point where it physically caused me discomfort and hurt me.
[03:26.74]I don't know if there's any clips of it.
[03:29.29]It was a long time ago.
[03:30.95]It was a guy was on drugs with the drug mod and he walked his dog in his house.
[03:39.96]And the dog pissed on the ground and started rolling around in it.
[03:43.84]That whole concept is just unbelievable.
[03:47.24]That you would put the leash on the dog and walk your dog in your house.
[03:56.59]I think that gave me a hernia.
[03:58.87]I think that's the day that I got it and it developed.
[04:01.71]I actually believe that.
[04:04.87]I remember having to wheel away from the computer because it hurt so much to even be in this room.
[04:13.89]Not this room.
[04:14.47]That was a long time ago.
[04:17.90]You can't get a hernia like that.
[04:19.60]I don't know, man.
[04:21.52]This hiatal hernia that I have, I feel like I gave it to myself somehow.
[04:30.53]Can you start playing?
[04:31.85]We're just hanging out for a second.
[04:33.09]Hold on.
[04:37.36]We're going to play The Sims 2.
[04:38.42]We played The Sims 2 earlier this year.
[04:43.04]I don't know.
[04:44.08]This is where I'm going to leave this up to you to help me.
[04:47.27]I don't think I'm just going to make some random guy, right?
[04:51.03]I'm just going to make a random person.
[04:55.43]I don't think I want to be like, oh, I'm making like Jerma and it's going to be like the Jerma house.
[04:59.11]No, no, no.
[04:59.65]We're just going to pick a guy and we're going to play as him.
[05:03.65]Random guy.
[05:07.00]I've done the... Hey, it's Jerma!
[05:08.90]Playing in The Sims!
[05:09.78]Jerma985!
[05:10.54]I've done that like 10 times.
[05:16.64]You played all of them except for two.
[05:18.44]What?
[05:20.00]Didn't I play The Sims 2?
[05:24.12]Earlier this year?
[05:25.08]That was The Sims... No, it was The Sims 2.
[05:31.00]But I don't know what I want to do because I... It's overwhelming.
[05:35.02]I gotta say something to Origin and EA.
[05:38.94]Guys.
[05:42.02]Why is there not an option?
[05:45.28]Should I even do this?
[05:46.28]I feel like everyone's waiting for me to do this.
[05:49.09]Is everybody waiting for this?
[05:52.29]Everyone's like leaning back.
[05:53.43]Here he goes.
[05:54.25]He's gonna talk about there's no cart on Origin for 20 minutes.
[05:58.07]I feel like everyone just leaned back and was waiting.
[06:02.10]Do I need to... I don't think I even need to do this right now.
[06:04.70]No, I don't think so.
[06:06.10]Okay, I'll do it in one sentence.
[06:08.24]Instead of like 25 sentences.
[06:10.68]So, we're going to do that in one sentence.
[06:12.84]Instead of doing a 25 sentence explanation of what I mean by this.
[06:15.28]So here comes the one sentence to explain this.
[06:18.52]And it goes as follows.
[06:21.24]There is no add to cart option when you're trying to buy shit on Origin for The Sims.
[06:27.28]There's like a hundred things to buy individually...
[06:30.73]There's no Omega bundles.
[06:33.19]There's bundles with like three things in it out of a hundred.
[06:39.72]How is there no cart?
[06:41.48]How is it?
[06:41.98]I just don't get it.
[06:44.49]And people said, dude, just buy it on Steam.
[06:46.55]Listen, I already bought like five or six expansions on Origin.
[06:51.43]So I was like, I guess I'll just do it on Origin.
[06:53.59]And I had to, I had to tell my bank.
[06:56.29]I got texted by my bank.
[06:58.26]Hey, we've declined purchases.
[06:59.46]There's like all these like fraudulent purchases going through the EA store.
[07:03.22]Like, no, that's me.
[07:04.73]That's me.
[07:05.29]And it's dumb.
[07:11.18]I was individually buying every one of these things.
[07:14.35]I was, dude, I was sitting there.
[07:16.63]I thought I was crazy.
[07:17.99]I'm like, there has to be a different way to do this on Origin.
[07:21.59]I was like looking up, like adding things to cart Origin.
[07:24.94]I don't, why?
[07:27.66]You have to go through the checkout process on each individual.
[07:31.62]Oh, one sentence.
[07:32.52]Shit.
[07:32.80]Fuck.
[07:34.37]I'm sorry.
[07:40.47]I didn't realize I was doing that.
[07:42.03]Alright.
[07:42.29]Alright.
[07:42.51]Alright.
[07:42.71]Alright.
[07:42.97]Alright.
[07:43.27]We're done.
[07:43.59]We're done.
[07:43.85]We're done.
[07:44.09]We're done.
[07:44.85]We're done.
[07:45.21]We're done.
[07:45.63]Fuck.
[07:46.35]Oh, I'm like embarrassed.
[07:47.83]That was at least 20 sentences.
[07:49.87]That was more than 25.
[07:50.65]Okay.
[07:50.87]Alright.
[07:51.45]Alright.
[07:51.67]Alright.
[07:51.87]Enough.
[07:52.07]Enough.
[07:52.27]Enough.
[07:52.45]So we're going to play The Sims 4.
[08:03.42]Oh, shit.
[08:04.30]You know when like you just know that you just get called out for something and it's completely true and it just makes you angry.
[08:15.67]No, hey, we gotta take the dollhouse out of the title.
[08:20.64]People are gonna see Jerma Dollhouse and they're gonna go, what?
[08:22.72]There's another dollhouse?
[08:24.46]No, we gotta get that out of the title.
[08:33.61]Okay, hold on.
[08:35.67]Origin doesn't have a shopping cart like that.
[08:37.43]Items are all purchased one at a time through the Origin store.
[08:39.53]The only exception would be the build your own bundle option.
[08:44.78]What?
[08:46.94]Build your own bundle?
[08:49.48]Build your own bundle.
[08:50.82]Where is that?
[08:52.16]Where is build your own bundle?
[08:56.64]Is this a pizza place?
[09:01.33]What do you mean build your own bundle?
[09:03.95]The bundle is three items at once though.
[09:08.71]Build your own bundle.
[09:11.57]I don't, if it's available, it's not advertised at all.
[09:15.18]I was looking for it everywhere.
[09:20.63]Alright.
[09:21.45]Okay.
[09:22.85]Can one of the mods change that title to something that... I spent two hours individually buying all these DLCs.
[09:28.10]You better enjoy... Oh, that's better.
[09:33.18]Build your own bundle.
[09:36.70]I'm so annoyed.
[09:38.42]And I'm gonna get over it.
[09:39.54]Alright, so let's go.
[09:44.86]And I know I'm going to get the comments of like, oh, dude, but like, oh, yeah, you just want to be able to click one button and spend a thousand dollars.
[09:52.08]It's like I don't want to do that.
[09:53.97]I just want to add stuff to cards.
[09:56.47]I don't need like the kitten costume pack.
[10:00.69]I don't want that.
[10:01.33]I just want the stuff that I want, but I don't want to individually buy every single one of them.
[10:08.53]But I think, you know what?
[10:09.41]I think I did buy like the pet costume pack.
[10:11.67]I don't know why, but I did.
[10:12.43]At least they make it start.
[10:19.45]People are going to be... I'm going to preemptively tell you this.
[10:22.93]Just so you understand.
[10:25.11]Yes.
[10:26.19]Yes, there is.
[10:26.99]It is a different... Did I tweet?
[10:31.64]Did I tweet this yet?
[10:32.22]I did?
[10:35.24]Alright.
[10:35.54]What's going on on the screen?
[10:40.24]Jesus.
[10:43.25]Alright.
[10:45.88]Here comes a new game.
[10:47.18]And let me turn the camera on, everyone's gonna freak out.
[10:48.82]Okay, everyone's gonna lose their mind.
[10:51.28]Yes, it is a new angle.
[10:53.77]There is a new camera angle today.
[10:56.09]And people are gonna think there's a monster coming out of this door.
[10:59.15]I just want to make sure everyone understands.
[11:01.73]I'm not in a new... This is not a new house.
[11:03.98]This is not a new place.
[11:05.80]And a monster's not coming out of this door.
[11:08.14]Okay?
[11:09.16]Okay?
[11:11.34]Why are you so red?
[11:12.30]Because I'm a... I don't know.
[11:13.62]I've... I don't know.
[11:15.64]Where's the red at the shelf?
[11:17.38]It's... I'm going to put something here instead.
[11:19.79]I just... I wanted to change some shit around.
[11:22.81]I wanted to move the room around.
[11:25.69]You know when you just kind of feel like, you know, the room is getting stale?
[11:30.45]The room's a little stale.
[11:32.33]I want to make this better.
[11:33.79]Right?
[11:33.95]You just kind of have to change it up.
[11:36.04]That's how it happened.
[11:36.96]Anyways, is the camera delayed?
[11:38.62]Somebody's saying the camera's behind.
[11:41.31]It really shouldn't be.
[11:42.14]Let's find out why.
[11:45.16]Is it behind?
[11:45.50]Amped audio slightly.
[11:50.92]Really?
[11:51.60]That's weird.
[11:57.05]Is it behind?
[11:57.51]Maybe not.
[12:05.73]I just don't think I move my lips that much sometimes when I talk.
[12:10.39]The audio is behind?
[12:11.91]Is it?
[12:12.11]It's weird.
[12:13.27]I don't know.
[12:14.83]I don't know why I can do this, but I can.
[12:19.17]I can't escape.
[12:19.65]Alright, let's go.
[12:20.61]Can you hear it?
[12:25.91]You guys can hear it, right?
[12:29.16]Alright.
[12:29.66]Uh, we're going to, we're going to make a sim and we're going to play.
[12:32.08]I don't know.
[12:32.34]There's like werewolves and shit.
[12:34.80]I got the werewolf expansion.
[12:36.22]I don't know what to do.
[12:37.96]Okay.
[12:42.25]So, hello.
[12:43.91]We'll do the name last.
[12:46.92]And should there be more than one person in this house?
[12:49.98]Skip 10 hours.
[12:51.10]We're not going to spend... I'm telling you, I promise.
[12:53.32]We're going to spend 20 minutes in the character creator.
[12:55.38]Maybe 15.
[12:55.84]Total.
[12:57.63]Maybe.
[13:01.57]Hmm.
[13:16.70]I already kind of like it.
[13:18.76]You need to have a dog, too.
[13:20.76]I don't want to do a bunch of animals, because every time there's ever been animals, it's like... I make like seven, and there's like five to seven animals in the house.
[13:33.95]And it sucks, because it's like there's too many animals in the house.
[13:38.47]Just one pet.
[13:39.11]Alright, maybe we'll do one.
[13:39.81]Alright, first of all, I gotta remember how to play this game.
[13:45.99]I don't think I want to do anything else.
[13:47.21]I think this is perfect.
[13:53.35]I don't know why I like this.
[13:55.42]That's not me.
[13:56.04]I don't look like this.
[14:04.94]Yeah, there's no... There's no slider mods.
[14:07.58]We're just doing straight up regular The Sims.
[14:22.71]I want to keep the hair.
[14:23.39]I think the hair is perfect.
[14:45.36]What do you mean I lied already?
[14:56.15]It's gotta be easy.
[14:56.93]Okay, I want him to... Why am I so red?
[14:59.73]That's weird.
[15:01.61]I just looked over here and saw that.
[15:02.55]I want it to be a little weird, but I don't want it to be crazy.
[15:07.75]I don't want it to be insane looking.
[15:17.78]Holy shit.
[15:27.75]Okay, I like it so far.
[15:33.00]Hold on.
[15:38.82]What do you think?
[15:58.24]I think that's good.
[16:00.68]What about the shoulders?
[16:05.10]I don't know.
[16:05.38]I'm kind of torn between the wide... Alright, this is... You gave him reptilian eyes.
[16:21.22]Alright, what about...
[16:29.20]Those are small feet.
[16:34.94]How tall is this person?
[16:37.62]Let me look at the hair.
[16:50.77]I don't know.
[16:51.19]This looks pretty good.
[16:52.01]I think I'm alright with this one.
[16:59.82]Alright, he's gonna have huge forearms and small biceps.
[17:02.07]I think that's fine.
[17:03.51]Big hands.
[17:04.69]I need to make his hands as big as they could possibly be.
[17:06.45]How do I pick his hands?
[17:11.45]Trimbo.
[17:23.41]Oh, Bumble.
[17:26.44]Okay.
[17:28.06]What are the aspirations going to be?
[17:29.26]This is going to be interesting.
[17:32.23]How do I give him a big hand?
[17:44.97]You can't.
[17:45.63]Oh, okay.
[17:46.79]Alright, I need... We have to close.
[17:52.62]Okay, that looks good.
[17:54.08]Alright, clothes.
[17:55.50]I really don't care about the clothes that much.
[18:05.72]It kind of looks like he would be on PeeWee's Playhouse.
[18:07.90]Alright, how about just outfits?
[18:25.36]How about... Oh, styled looks.
[18:28.80]Oh, wait.
[18:29.52]I got the Star Wars shit.
[18:31.02]I can make him like a Jedi.
[18:33.28]Is that like a path you can take?
[18:34.82]I can give this guy a lightsaber.
[18:40.46]And that's not modded.
[18:41.38]I swear.

[19:51.04]No, I'm going to hate this after like 15 minutes.
[19:53.50]Something else.
[19:56.88]I got to finish the face.
[19:57.98]We got to get the hat off.
[20:00.77]Or maybe not.
[20:01.33]No, he can't just be like a weirdo.
[20:08.41]Why is this locked?
[20:09.33]First order rank three trooper.
[20:11.64]Are you going to be a storm trooper?
[20:14.24]Is that a career path?
[20:20.21]That's... Alright.
[20:21.51]I'm sticking with this.
[20:22.15]So what is this?
[20:30.61]This is a party?
[20:31.71]Okay, this is for a party.
[20:41.88]Okay.
[20:43.30]Alright.
[20:45.78]Summertime.
[20:46.36]You're gonna keep the glasses?
[20:48.50]Alright, this is fun.
[20:53.23]I think this is alright.
[20:54.09]Every day... I don't like him.
[21:07.40]Please change the outfit.
[21:18.93]We can change the outfit later.
[21:22.48]Alright, we need to make personality now.
[21:24.84]Alright.
[21:25.82]Aspiration.
[21:28.28]Family.
[21:28.88]Food.
[21:30.70]Location.
[21:31.32]Knowledge.
[21:31.90]Nature.
[21:32.38]Wellness.
[21:33.80]Werewolf.
[21:35.60]Okay.
[21:35.90]These Sims get an initial relationship boost when introducing themselves to werewolves.
[21:41.42]Do I have to talk to other werewolves?
[21:44.71]Make it Star Wars.
[21:47.53]Wait, what?
[21:50.10]Sims who are prepared voyagers fill up their needs slightly when... God, this is perfect.
[22:00.47]Hope versus order or galactic privateer.
[22:05.19]This sim isn't about choosing sides.
[22:06.73]They're happy just mingling among the smugglers and bounty hunters on the fringe planet of Batuu.
[22:11.67]Earning a few extra credits along the way is just a bonus, no matter how they get them.

[25:54.32]Oh, I just voice cracked a little.
[25:57.63]Alright, so you're self-assured.

[26:05.40]I mean, if you're choosing as your career to be a Star Wars Jedi Master... You have to be a nerd, right?
[26:14.03]That's not an insult.

[27:12.73]Hello, my name is... I don't know.
[27:19.39]What's a good name?

[27:23.04]No, it can't be John.
[27:28.70]Blork snorgles.
[27:32.84]You just said what a sim says in conversation.
[27:37.00]That means, like, hello.
[27:43.20]Clark Storgles.
[27:49.06]Pete Angus.
[27:55.48]I'm going to say this out loud because I think this is a very terrible name for a sim, but I do enjoy the comedic effort for Jerkel Offman.
[28:05.84]I do appreciate the effort.
[28:07.68]The effort is there.
[28:13.67]How about... No, I'm not going to name him Stinky Dinky.
[28:19.63]I always have such trouble with names.
[28:25.13]I just can't do them.
[28:40.48]Bobby... Tom Tatooine?
[28:52.94]No, that sucks.
[28:54.42]No, I'm not going to name the guy Bobby Jerkoff.
[28:57.28]He's not going to be named Jerkoff anything.
[28:59.60]Not Bobby Jerkoff, not Jerkoff Stevenson.
[29:02.42]I'm sorry, that's not this person's name, so we're going to have to move on.
[29:05.08]We're moving on.
[29:11.23]What's a... Bobby... Bob... Bill... Bill... Solo.
[29:29.78]That's even worse.
[29:32.88]How about... What was it?
[29:34.64]Blorg?
[29:37.41]Blorg's...
[29:41.23]Blorg Solo?
[29:51.67]Uh, I like Blorg Solo.
[29:59.94]How about Blorg McDonald?
[30:02.46]No.
[30:03.54]Um...
[30:12.40]This is the hardest part.
[30:13.46]I can't do it.
[30:14.36]I hate this.
[30:19.63]Blorg Hendrix.
[30:21.01]Blorg McNulty.
[30:27.67]Do we like Blorg McNulty?
[30:33.49]That seems actually pretty good.
[30:35.05]Okay, we got Blorg McNulty.
[30:37.86]Who's next?
[30:42.46]Uh... We have to do a pet, right?
[30:46.16]We have to make a dog.
[30:50.48]One dog, one dog, no cats, one dog.
[30:53.71]I'm not making ten animals.
[30:55.03]It's hard to take care of them all.
[30:59.03]It's gonna be a poodle.
[31:05.73]It has to be a Star Wars looking dog, you know what I mean?
[31:09.55]How do I make like a Star Wars character?
[31:11.41]Can I make like the legs bigger and stuff?
[31:19.43]I need to make like a Star Wars monster.
[31:37.73]There's no body slider enhancements or anything, so... I can't do those right now.
[32:20.55]Alright, I like it so far.
[32:23.63]What about ears?
[32:24.37]Hold on.
[32:27.84]I think it has to stay this way.
[32:39.44]It has to stay that way.
[32:43.66]Yeah.
[32:45.74]The dog's name is going to be Chewy.
[32:59.86]It looks like Otto.
[33:02.86]Okay.
[33:03.80]I think Chewy's fine.
[33:13.53]Is that too much?
[33:14.49]Is it too weird?
[33:15.23]Okay, well, how do I change the code?
[33:35.78]I think that's fine.
[33:37.40]Make him a green dog?
[33:41.05]Chewie's not green.
[33:46.28]This just doesn't, this just looks strange.
[34:01.26]Wow, this doesn't make any sense.
[34:18.79]Yoda that's actually alright now.
[34:22.25]Yeah No, it's gonna be like like yodel right I'm not getting sued this is yodel This is yo, you don't need you just yodel I

[34:48.00]That's it.
[34:48.38]Yodel.
[34:48.72]Alright, what do you like?
[34:52.97]Smart.
[34:55.03]What is this?
[34:57.43]Oh, not, okay.
[34:58.37]Smart.
[34:58.75]Troublemaker.
[35:00.33]Aggressive.

[35:28.76]Glutton.
[35:32.88]Okay.
[35:33.90]I think yodel, yodel, yodel is fine.
[35:38.92]Look, I want to play the video game, right?
[35:42.16]Far too many times that I've opened this game, we make a bunch of weirdos, and then they all attack each other and stab each other and shoot each other.
[35:51.21]We need to play The Sims.
[35:52.29]You know what I mean?
[35:53.43]We need to keep these people around.
[35:57.76]And it happens within, like, an hour.
[35:59.38]And then I sit around.
[36:00.16]Do you remember the last time I played this?
[36:02.70]When an hour went by, they started killing each other, and then I dropped two meteors on their house.
[36:08.13]And then I was like, I don't know what to do now.
[36:10.69]Like, I can't play the game anymore.
[36:12.11]I can't play it.
[36:13.17]There's no... You don't go make macaroni and cheese after that.
[36:16.39]It's over.
[36:17.27]You don't go back and like, yeah, I guess I'm gonna queue up, go to the fridge, take a shower, and take a bath.
[36:22.05]No.
[36:23.21]No, we can't go that way.
[36:26.24]Why do you look like this?
[36:27.68]I don't know.
[36:28.06]Do the DLC.
[36:30.88]Yeah, we're gonna do DLC.
[36:32.00]Alright.
[36:32.46]This is the house.
[36:33.68]We've got the dog.
[36:34.88]We've got the guy.
[36:35.77]And I'm done.
[36:36.95]I'm not micromanaging ten people.
[36:38.97]It's impossible.
[36:40.13]What the fuck did somebody just post?
[36:45.19]Your webcam audio is late.
[36:46.73]What is happening?
[36:49.75]Are you guys for real?
[36:50.43]Alright, I'm ready.
[36:56.39]Let's take this household.
[37:02.36]We have everything we need.
[37:03.56]It's the McNulty family.
[37:07.54]Wait, I want a different pose.
[37:09.04]How do I do a different pose?
[37:09.78]I like that one.
[37:27.31]It's off by a split second.
[37:31.27]I don't know why that would be the case.
[37:32.61]Hold on.
[37:33.93]Oh, I do know why it's off.
[37:38.92]It is off.
[37:39.42]Yeah, it is.
[37:42.70]Because of the delay coming through.
[37:45.54]No, it's not.
[37:47.80]No, it's not.
[37:48.28]It's not.
[37:50.48]It's not.
[37:53.42]One, two, three.
[37:58.11]Is it one guy?
[37:58.81]I don't get it.
[38:06.94]Oh, is it early?
[38:07.50]I thought I had a delay, but I didn't.
[38:10.06]Alright, so this is important.
[38:11.03]This is very important.
[38:14.33]I have like every expansion, I have no idea where to go or what to do.
[38:17.21]What season should this be?
[38:20.33]Spring is a great time to plant your garden to take advantage of... I don't... No, we're not doing that.
[38:24.13]Temperatures are climbing, so beat the heat with water balloons and sprinklers.
[38:26.73]Watch out for the thunderstorms.
[38:27.77]Alright, that's kind of cool.
[38:31.37]Gather your garden.
[38:33.01]No.
[38:33.67]No garden.
[38:34.79]When you're not bundled up indoors, have some fun in the snow and ice.
[38:37.48]Alright, summer or fall?
[38:41.24]Summer or winter.
[38:41.96]I'm in.
[38:51.61]Can we get a poll in the chat?
[38:55.32]Let's get a poll.
[38:56.66]Summer or winter?
[38:57.76]Pick one.
[38:58.80]Whoever gets more wins.
[38:59.40]You can go ahead and pick one.
[39:17.31]That shouldn't have been on.
[39:21.49]Did my mic sound fucked up?
[39:22.55]Because that literally should not have been turned on.
[39:27.71]Are we good now?
[39:30.87]Actually, it probably sounds better now.
[39:33.27]Winter is winning by a landslide.
[39:38.82]Oh my god, it is.
[39:39.62]Okay, yeah.
[39:45.60]Let me just double check there's not some weird setting that I turned on.
[39:48.76]I don't think there is.
[39:52.54]No, I don't have any, like, filters on.
[39:54.02]I don't have any delays on.
[39:56.34]Everything's set to be not delayed or anything.
[39:58.44]That's so weird.
[39:59.40]I wonder why.
[39:59.82]Alright, winner.
[40:07.47]I bought a bunch of winner packs, too.
[40:12.57]I have no idea.
[40:13.43]This is so overwhelming.
[40:14.59]I'm not going here.
[40:15.47]That's what I know.
[40:15.95]New crest?
[40:17.21]New crest?
[40:19.56]Magnolia... Promenade... Windenburg... San... Forgotten Hollow... Del Sol Valley... Glimmerbrook... A mountain... Moonwood Mill... Go to Forgotten Hollow.
[40:43.28]Okay, this looks like a werewolf one.
[40:45.04]Go to Glimmerbrook.
[40:46.58]The quiet town of Glimmerbrook may have more to it than meets the eye.
[40:49.96]Do I want to do a bunch of weird shit right off the bat?
[40:51.66]This is like a map.
[40:58.35]This place sucks.
[41:01.81]There's one place to live.
[41:04.73]What?
[41:07.59]There's one house and a bar.
[41:13.65]Only one person gets to live here?
[41:15.27]Well, there's a magical portal.
[41:17.23]That's kind of cool.
[41:20.38]How do I go back?
[41:22.54]What's the other one?
[41:23.00]Alright, this is like a scary place.
[41:29.96]It's like Halloween Town.
[41:33.50]This place?
[41:34.70]This place, it looks weird.
[41:36.25]It's weird two-story... This place is... It's $18,000. $18,000.
[41:48.00]Yeah, but people can visit you from around the world, right?
[41:52.26]No, we're starting normal.
[41:55.30]I can move to one of these places.
[41:56.76]Keep that in mind.
[42:02.48]What about... What's this?
[42:06.09]Oh, look at this.
[42:06.69]This place is a bustling town.
[42:09.53]How much does this place cost?
[42:12.77]Ooh, look at this one.
[42:16.48]So where is this?
[42:17.32]Starlight Boulevard.
[42:18.48]Have I... Sims cannot live on this residence.
[42:22.06]Didn't I do a thing where I was trying to be like a famous person?
[42:24.26]Or was that Sims 3?
[42:28.50]No, this place sucks.
[42:36.70]Boo, boo, boo.
[42:38.56]Go to the mountain.
[42:39.06]Let me check it out.
[42:42.46]Oh, look at this place.
[42:43.74]It's got a ski resort.
[42:48.51]This is only two grand.
[42:54.78]This is perfect.
[42:59.62]I think I want to do the mountain town.
[43:02.13]Okay, it's a toss up here.
[43:04.81]Alright, I'm going to give you some choices here.
[43:06.47]The mountain town.
[43:07.79]What's this?
[43:10.99]Wow.
[43:11.33]Wow.
[43:14.44]Wow.
[43:16.97]This is unbelievably beautiful here.
[43:21.06]There's a big fountain.
[43:22.38]It's like a port.
[43:25.72]I think I'm making my decision.
[43:29.16]I'm going to buy this place right on the beach.
[43:31.00]I'm doing a beach house.
[43:33.04]You can batch test me all you want.
[43:34.04]That's fine.
[43:35.92]Hold on.
[43:40.14]Alright, this is kind of a city.
[43:41.26]We can visit this place, right?
[43:42.74]We can visit.
[43:44.20]I'm doing a beach.
[43:44.72]The beach.
[43:45.14]Yeah, beach.
[43:49.74]I'm going for it.
[43:50.46]Let's go.
[43:52.20]It's time.
[43:53.29]Unfurnished.
[43:53.77]I'm going to build the house.
[43:59.05]BatChest.
[43:59.71]We got $18,000.
[44:04.35]It's winter.
[44:08.51]Yeah, but I'll prepare for the... Where do I build?
[44:12.53]Oh, this is actually... I don't want to... Wait.
[44:13.71]This is where I have to build right on the water?
[44:18.95]Wait, where's my house gonna be?
[44:25.90]That's kind of... I don't know about that.
[44:31.32]This is it.
[44:32.16]Look at this neighborhood.
[44:32.88]Alright, we'll go for it.
[44:34.22]We'll go for it.
[44:34.66]If I don't like it, I'll just fucking do the cheat and bulldoze it and go somewhere else.
[44:39.44]Alright, build time.
[44:40.52]Let's go.
[44:43.00]Challenge yourself.
[44:43.80]No, thank you.
[44:45.58]Is this new music?
[44:48.67]Alright.
[44:49.59]First things first.
[44:50.69]We gotta do the right angle here.
[44:57.41]And I want to be able to literally just look out my window and there's the water, you know what I mean?
[45:01.66]Right here.
[45:01.92]Okay, this is the mailbox, yep.
[45:08.12]Alright, let's do it.
[45:09.74]Okay, here we go.
[45:13.34]This lot is not that big!
[45:14.66]There's not very much space.
[45:19.68]Okay, let's start with just right here.
[45:21.42]I don't want to blow all my money.
[45:25.26]Hold on.
[45:25.66]Wait, don't do that.
[45:26.42]How about like this?
[45:31.86]How do I flip?
[45:32.32]How do you flip something?
[45:34.10]Is it middle mouse?
[45:36.18]How do you flip something?
[45:37.16]How do you flip?
[45:39.52]L?
[45:39.60]What are you doing?
[45:42.70]Why would you do that?
[45:43.22]How do you flip something?
[45:45.92]R?
[45:46.00]Nope.
[45:49.69]Period?
[45:50.75]There it is, thank you.
[45:51.33]This has got to be much bigger.
[46:14.86]How much money do I have?
[46:15.46]I don't want to blow everything.
[46:19.54]Alright, so this is going to be the kitchen kind of bathroom area.
[46:36.79]Oh, shit, I'm putting it.
[46:37.79]Alright, well, that's actually makes sense, right?
[46:39.47]How do I do the angle pitch?
[46:47.12]Was that was upstairs?
[46:50.72]Alright, this is fine right now.
[46:52.92]Make it a little bit bigger this way.
[46:54.48]And then a little bit bigger this way.
[46:57.06]I only have 15 grand.
[46:59.87]Period.
[47:00.19]Now how do I go like this?
[47:02.25]Alright, now I need steps to get up here.
[47:14.80]How do I just do steps this way?
[47:24.06]Actually, I don't hate that, though.
[47:25.14]Hold on.
[47:34.50]Okay.
[47:37.40]Comma.
[47:40.88]No, I want to pitch the camera.
[47:46.63]Okay, now I need a door here.
[47:48.11]Okay.
[47:57.63]Uh, I need to put the walls up.
[47:59.56]What's that button?
[48:01.88]Use The Sims 3 camera?
[48:03.04]Is it in the settings?
[48:03.74]Is it actually?
[48:04.26]Game camera.
[48:08.92]Oh, yeah.
[48:12.68]Oh, yeah, thank you so much.
[48:13.91]What a million times better thing to do.
[48:16.27]That's what I was looking for.
[48:17.19]Yeah, there it is.
[48:17.69]Alright, we're good.
[48:19.87]Okay, now I need to put the... Uh, I need to put the walls up.
[48:24.87]Uh, helper Andy's.
[48:26.59]How do I put the walls up, please?
[48:27.77]It's not period.
[48:34.52]Page up and page down.
[48:37.46]Thank you.
[48:37.86]Alright, I need a door.
[48:46.32]I don't hate that.
[48:50.90]This is like how to get to the kitchen in a restaurant.
[48:54.20]I'm gonna put that for the kitchen door.
[48:57.88]I do have like every expansion, so this is just a ton of random doors.
[49:01.82]Wait, I need a Star Wars door.
[49:04.00]First resistance blast door.
[49:06.83]No, this is lame.
[49:07.73]This is lame to start with that.
[49:12.95]VIP door?
[49:17.75]An elevator?
[49:21.51]It has to be something interesting, but not weird, right?
[49:27.81]How about... Okay, look at that.
[49:29.83]That looks alright.
[49:32.75]I need it outside.
[49:33.45]Okay, I need wallpaper.
[49:35.37]Alright, this is for the outside of the house.
[49:43.38]Okay, no.
[49:45.24]No.
[49:46.72]No.
[49:48.00]No.
[49:48.32]Just something solid, like paint.
[49:50.40]Siding, here it is.
[49:53.24]No.
[49:55.24]No.
[49:57.12]No.
[49:57.84]It's a beach house.
[49:59.34]There we go.
[50:00.02]Okay.
[50:12.05]That's pretty beachy.
[50:12.97]Yeah.
[50:19.67]I'm going to have such a cool, you understand, my back deck and back patio and everything is going to be so awesome.
[50:24.21]It's going to be a huge thing.
[50:25.33]It's going to go down.
[50:28.94]Alright.
[50:29.22]So now I need to do this.
[50:30.92]I don't know.
[50:31.38]I don't like how this looks, though.
[50:32.82]I don't care.
[50:34.66]Page down.
[50:35.08]Alright.
[50:36.72]I need to start to think about this.
[50:38.68]But you're going to walk right into the kitchen.
[50:39.96]So here we go.
[50:40.38]Let's get this blocked off.
[50:48.28]Alright.
[50:48.90]So I'm thinking kitchen's going to be boink.
[50:52.40]Bathroom's going to be boink.
[50:53.98]Living room's going to be boink.
[50:55.56]And bedroom's going to be boink.
[50:56.98]I think that makes sense to me.
[50:58.94]If I were to just say, I think that would make sense to me.
[51:01.40]It's a Minecraft house.
[51:02.27]Yeah, it's alright.
[51:05.53]Alright.
[51:09.05]First things first.
[51:09.99]I need to do this in order because I always do this wrong.
[51:13.43]I need a kitchen area.
[51:18.03]Stone?
[51:21.21]That is a Minecraft house.
[51:24.25]It needs to be beachy.
[51:26.04]I'm thinking, you know, yellows, oranges, blue, light blue, light blue, yellow, right?
[51:39.32]Let's just go with the wallpaper.
[51:40.34]Just a solid color.
[51:45.42]How do I just do a solid color?
[51:47.94]Oh, here it is, my paint.
[51:54.96]Alright.
[51:55.62]Wait, this is kind of beachy.
[51:57.88]Sandy.
[51:58.44]Yep.
[51:59.68]Do that.
[52:07.98]Right to about here.
[52:08.66]That looks good.
[52:10.96]And then let's get a little bit of blue in here.
[52:14.14]Like this.
[52:15.62]Okay.
[52:15.92]Remember, it's a beach house.
[52:18.46]Why is it invisible?
[52:19.24]It's not.
[52:19.92]There's no light in here.
[52:20.68]Okay.
[52:28.88]Dude, I'm telling you right now.
[52:33.19]Guess what's going on the wall.
[52:35.63]Can you tell me what I'm going to put in here?
[52:39.21]I'm going to put a ship wheel on the wall.
[52:45.75]I'm going to have a ship steering wheel on the wall.
[52:52.37]Alright.
[52:54.13]G hides the grid.
[52:55.11]Thank you.
[52:55.47]That's actually really helpful.
[52:56.89]Floors.
[52:58.26]Floors, floors, floors, floors.
[53:00.10]It's pretty beachy.
[53:08.60]That's pretty beachy.
[53:14.03]It kind of looks like you pulled a carpet up and that's just the wood with the glue all over it.
[53:17.11]Don't matter.
[53:18.01]You need windows.
[53:18.93]I'm getting there.
[53:19.53]Hold on.
[53:19.85]I have to make... Wait.
[53:22.68]I want a huge bay window looking at the water.
[53:31.75]Can you imagine?
[53:35.33]How big can I make this?
[53:46.35]Now that's kind of cool.
[53:52.33]That's pretty cool.
[53:57.59]Imposter house.
[53:58.48]I don't even know what that means.
[54:00.74]You can make big objects bigger or smaller.
[54:02.56]What the?
[54:03.62]Holy shit.
[54:04.58]Okay.
[54:04.86]Wait a minute.
[54:05.40]I didn't know you could do that.
[54:12.62]Oh my goodness.
[54:13.62]Alright.
[54:13.82]Well, it's not going to fit.
[54:17.57]That's insane.
[54:18.16]Alright.
[54:19.10]I think that looks fine.
[54:21.62]Now I need... We got to do the floor in here.
[54:24.20]Remember, one of the... Wait, where's the bathroom?
[54:27.05]Bathroom is definitely not going to be here.
[54:30.51]A full window.
[54:31.49]No, no, no, no, no.
[54:35.12]Bathroom will be here.
[54:36.98]Section that off right now.
[54:48.89]There we go.
[54:49.31]Alright.
[54:49.57]So this is, you know, the little area to kind of hang out.
[54:53.17]Living room, bathroom, bedroom.
[54:57.09]Right here.
[55:01.35]Let's do bathroom.
[55:02.21]Let's get bathroom out of the way.
[55:03.29]I want tile.
[55:06.97]Tiles?
[55:07.83]I don't like tile.
[55:09.07]I like tile.
[55:10.35]Get over it.
[55:14.99]Hmm.
[55:15.47]Beachy, though.
[55:16.27]I like that.
[55:17.13]No, I don't.
[55:17.78]It's like a public bathroom.
[55:29.15]Ooh, now that's cool.
[55:30.93]Yeah.
[55:32.21]Yep.
[55:34.21]Now we need wallpaper for the bathroom.
[55:36.91]What are you guys thinking?
[55:39.97]How come this Halloween music... I don't know why this... Yeah, it's... It's just whatever The Sims music is cycling through right now.
[55:49.86]Hmm.
[55:50.78]Should we tile on the wall?
[55:53.70]How about masonry?
[55:57.01]Ooh.
[55:57.85]Yeah, it is like scary music.
[56:03.96]It's because of how the werewolf expansion turned on.
[56:08.56]I think it's because the werewolf expansion is currently active.
[56:18.36]I don't mind this.
[56:20.38]Look at that.
[56:20.70]That looks kind of cool.
[56:22.74]Kind of... No.
[56:24.06]It's just a solid color for now.
[56:29.68]How about like... Something light?
[56:35.09]Light?
[56:37.73]Yeah, who cares?
[56:38.31]It doesn't matter.
[56:40.43]Alright, so that's the bathroom.
[56:42.11]This is the... What should I do for this?
[56:47.31]Fucking cop it.
[56:49.95]Oh, I want to tell you something.
[56:51.25]So, um... Holly and I were laughing on the couch the other day.
[56:56.43]Because she told me...
[56:59.36]that I have a catchphrase that I, she's like, you say this all the time.
[57:03.41]I was like, what are you talking about?
[57:07.14]She's telling me, like, hey, you know you say that a lot.
[57:09.26]I'm like, say what?
[57:10.59]Apparently, I don't, I have a catchphrase between me and my girlfriend that I don't even realize I have it.
[57:15.69]And, I, I, apparently I say, like, oh, fucking, like, garlic, uh, garlic, kid.
[57:19.53]Oh, yeah, give me some fucking garlic, dude.
[57:22.38]For no reason, apparently.
[57:23.44]And I'm like, no, there has to be a reason of why I'm saying, like, oh, fucking garlic.
[57:27.20]I just do, like, a Boston accent joke.
[57:29.88]And I say, garlic.
[57:32.13]But I don't know why I'm saying it.
[57:34.63]And I'm like, well, no, it's probably that garlic is on screen or somebody mentions garlic.
[57:38.85]She's like, no.
[57:39.39]She's like, no, you would just be sitting around.
[57:41.57]You just look over to me and go like, oh, fucking garlic, kid.
[57:44.77]I'm like, there's no way I do that.
[57:46.55]It's impossible.
[57:48.27]But apparently I have a catchphrase that I did not know I had until literally two days ago.
[57:54.12]Fucking garlic, dude.
[57:55.56]I don't know why.
[57:56.32]And I'm like, why would I say that?
[57:59.30]She's like, I don't know.
[58:00.14]You just do.
[58:02.22]And now that I think about it, I kind of like, I kind of do that.
[58:09.20]Oh, fucking garlic, dude.
[58:11.08]I don't know why.
[58:11.74]Oof.
[58:17.60]No, no, not floor tiles.
[58:21.32]Actually, I don't like wooden floors.
[58:23.55]They're so noisy and they're so, I hate them.
[58:26.79]I know that's the modern thing to do right now is, oh man, wood floors, wooden, you know, authentic wood.
[58:31.88]When you step on a wood floor, it goes like this.
[58:39.24]Every single time you put your feet down.
[58:42.32]And sometimes randomly, randomly, you'll be lying in bed and you will hear this at four o'clock in the morning.
[58:50.07]And go, what the fuck was that?
[58:55.11]They're just loud.
[58:56.34]They make sounds.
[58:57.00]They expand.
[58:57.80]I hate them.
[59:04.84]It's called Slippers.
[59:09.54]It's noisy.
[59:10.62]It's noisy.
[59:11.55]And the sound bounces off of it.
[59:14.75]I like fucking coffins, dude.
[59:16.39]Just like I like garlic.
[59:18.85]How do I turn the camera off?
[59:19.59]I...
[59:21.31]I forgot I redid this whole setup so I can't escape.
[59:23.90]I have to sit here and live with what I just did.
[59:29.70]Yeah, carpets are gross if you don't take care of them.
[59:33.36]All you guys saying carpets smell like puke and stuff.
[59:37.78]Are you wearing your shoes in those rooms?
[59:40.10]Take your shoes off before you get on the carpet and vacuum it every so often for God's sakes.
[59:47.83]If you spill an entire two liter of coke on the ground, you're going to need to clean it.
[59:51.49]You're going to need to get in there and clean up the carpet.
[59:54.69]You don't just move something, a rug over it.
[59:59.29]Nah, dude, nah, you fucked up.
[60:00.51]Every carpet in the past smells like puke.
[60:03.00]Did you puke on it and didn't clean it?
[60:05.62]It's called vacuuming.
[60:06.78]It's called cleaning.
[60:08.60]And it's called not wearing your shoes in the room where the carpets are.
[60:18.08]Okay.
[60:19.04]Let's do carpet.
[60:21.90]What's with all these patterns?
[60:23.16]Wait, why?
[60:23.68]What's with these patterns?
[60:26.54]Oh, there it is.
[60:26.96]Okay.
[60:28.02]And I'm just going to go, we're just going to go standard.
[60:29.88]Yeah.
[60:32.56]Okay.
[60:32.80]Let's get some objects.
[60:33.72]13 grand.
[60:34.04]Let's do the kitchen.
[60:43.05]Why is it getting weirder?
[60:44.71]Music's getting, alright.
[60:45.53]I don't want to do anything too crazy.
[60:49.35]You want to spend money on the cookware though, right?
[60:52.01]So you don't burn the house down.
[60:56.37]Oh, I need windows.
[61:01.48]Short, classic casement.
[61:08.58]That's fine, right?
[61:10.42]Just classic windows.
[61:13.58]I don't think I need a window in this room.
[61:15.57]This whole room is a window.
[61:16.51]Maybe one or two here.
[61:32.64]You should use Linux.
[61:35.78]Alright.
[61:42.96]This whole room is a window.
[61:44.52]No, I'm not going to put any more windows in here.
[61:47.97]There you go.
[61:48.31]There's your window.
[61:48.93]And we'll do a bathroom window.
[61:53.35]No, no bathroom window.
[61:54.15]Alright, here we go.
[61:55.67]Kitchen stuff.
[61:57.76]We got the fridge.
[61:58.38]We need a stove.
[61:59.16]I need counters, too.
[62:00.02]Remember, the theme is beach.
[62:04.62]I think that's a decent color, too.
[62:08.43]Do two counters.
[62:10.31]Stove.
[62:10.75]Because we need a sink.
[62:13.43]So let's do stove.
[62:14.09]I don't want to lose all my money, but this is how you burn a house down, so... I'm thinking of going with London's choice.
[62:23.31]Ooh, let's do this one.
[62:30.50]London's choice.
[62:31.32]Food quality 7, power consumption, reliability, and plus cooking skill.
[62:35.28]You need lights in here.
[62:36.10]I will.
[62:36.36]Where's the best place to get lights?
[62:47.01]How do I get lights?
[62:47.65]Is lighting its own thing?
[62:58.86]Objects by function lighting.
[63:01.00]Okay.
[63:02.72]Oh, this look at that.
[63:03.98]Alright.
[63:04.40]So let's do wall lights.
[63:11.22]I'm a big fan of just basic lighting.
[63:12.95]I don't like chandeliers.
[63:14.55]I feel like they're gonna drop on me and crush me like a cartoon.
[63:16.99]I don't like them.
[63:17.67]They freak me out.
[63:20.43]I don't like anything hanging.
[63:21.67]I don't like ceiling fans.
[63:25.03]Ceiling fans, they scare me.
[63:27.33]I feel like they're going to fall and just chop me up.
[63:31.03]Anytime I've ever had a place where it's like, oh, there's a ceiling fan literally right above the fucking bed.
[63:35.71]It's just like, I don't want to turn that on.
[63:38.16]Oh, let's turn it on high.
[63:39.06]This is a helicopter blade that's about to drop.
[63:44.46]I don't like them.
[63:45.42]They kind of freak me out.
[63:47.74]Even if they're installed properly.
[63:50.16]I don't know.
[63:50.84]It's weird to me.
[63:53.56]I'll just try to put a fan in the corner.
[63:55.33]Just kind of... If you like ceiling fans, it's up to you.
[63:58.97]But I don't like any hanging objects.
[64:06.24]There we go.
[64:06.64]This is perfect.
[64:10.50]Should we do ceiling lights or should we do on the wall?
[64:12.54]These are probably the best, right?
[64:16.24]Just do like two, three cans.
[64:24.01]Wall lights apart.
[64:24.69]You want to see wall lights?
[64:25.73]No, I'm not doing fluorescent lights.
[64:32.59]Oh, look at that.
[64:33.33]That's cute.
[64:34.71]We'll do two of these.
[64:36.91]Where are lights usually in houses?
[64:39.51]You ever like stop and think, don't look in your room and don't look in your house.
[64:42.71]Where does it, like, where does it, where do you, what are the little lights on your walls?
[64:47.14]Besides the ceiling, right?
[64:48.30]Forget about the ceiling.
[64:49.98]If you have like a, like a wall, a wall light, like where did, where is it?
[64:52.94]Where does it go?
[64:55.56]Up on the ceiling.
[64:56.42]Yeah, but you know what I'm saying by that?
[64:59.63]Like above the door, right?
[65:02.81]With a shelf.
[65:04.51]In corners, yeah.
[65:07.77]I'm gonna go like this.
[65:09.57]I'm gonna do a cute shelf here too.
[65:12.24]Is this painted?
[65:23.12]Look at how charming that is.
[65:26.19]There's 30,000 people here?
[65:28.23]What the?
[65:28.65]There are!
[65:28.99]There are 30!
[65:29.55]What are you doing here?
[65:30.31]Why are there this many people here?
[65:35.37]What's going on?
[65:35.89]Why are there so many people here?
[65:38.27]What the fuck?
[65:39.09]These are Minecraft torches.
[65:40.45]That's fine.
[65:42.29]Anyways, hi.
[65:42.67]How you doing?
[65:44.86]It's the Among Us waiting room.
[65:47.26]Holy shit.
[65:48.34]Oh, welcome everybody.
[65:49.52]Hi.
[65:50.66]Alright.
[65:52.42]So that's good.
[65:52.96]I need to sync.
[66:00.33]Every time I buy... No, don't do this, right?
[66:02.45]Everyone just... Everyone goes to the top left section and buys the top left sink.
[66:06.09]Don't in The Sims.
[66:06.85]They break every five minutes.
[66:07.81]It's just water just shoots out of them.
[66:11.06]Bring up some extra cash here and buy a good one.
[66:15.72]Yeah, like this one.
[66:16.52]This one, what?
[66:16.92]This one here is like a 125.
[66:18.24]No, no, no.
[66:18.76]You gotta... You gotta pony up here.
[66:23.18]Yeah, like this one.
[66:27.64]See?
[66:28.11]This one's nice and modern.
[66:34.07]Could you please say the McRiddle in the SCORN voice?
[66:40.68]I understand that you're in your editing program.
[66:42.76]You're in like Premiere.
[66:44.02]And you're hovering over this section of the video you're editing.
[66:46.81]Where you're like, fuck, I really have to get him to say this.
[66:48.43]And it's like the last thing you have to implant in the timeline.
[66:53.71]But I mean, I'm sorry.
[66:54.73]You're going to have to wing it.
[66:55.91]You're going to have to wing it.
[67:01.60]Alright, that's good.
[67:02.38]Now I need a toaster oven.
[67:04.89]Should I do one more counter?
[67:10.93]Yeah, just in case.
[67:13.01]What about a dishwasher?
[67:13.85]No, they don't use it.
[67:16.43]Put trash over here.
[67:18.05]But people need to be able to come in the fucking house.
[67:20.99]Oh my god, I'm so dumb.
[67:22.51]There can't be anything here.
[67:24.29]How about like this way?
[67:35.08]I think that's good.
[67:38.76]Yeah, that looks fine.
[67:39.46]And then put like, you know, a coffee maker, a toaster oven, all the appliances.
[67:43.61]Let's see what we got.
[67:52.39]Should I just install a subway into the... I feel like this would be awesome.
[67:59.14]Can you imagine if you just woke up in the morning and went into your kitchen and it was just like a subway station?
[68:06.94]Somebody has to maintain this, though.
[68:18.91]Can I actually make food with this?
[68:23.20]If I remove everything here except the sink... Is this... Can I make food here?
[68:37.61]It's a beach house.
[68:38.25]It's like a vacation house.
[69:03.10]That's alright.
[69:08.41]I think that looks... That's alright.
[69:11.23]Put a trash can right here.
[69:12.81]Got it.
[69:13.05]Alright.
[69:13.57]Now we need a microwave and a coffee maker.
[69:21.69]This one seems fine.
[69:23.37]But it's coming together.
[69:26.61]Now I need a trash can.
[69:29.39]Just a little bin.
[69:30.96]Right here.
[69:34.66]Is it too big?
[69:35.12]What about a little one?
[69:38.00]This one?
[69:40.22]Come on.
[69:40.92]Really?
[69:41.14]I don't like this weird space here.
[69:44.04]I hate this so much.
[69:54.54]And I can't fix it.
[69:57.16]That's okay.
[69:59.36]I don't despise that.
[70:03.25]And then we put a little table here.
[70:06.45]Move the door one over.
[70:12.18]That person is smart.
[70:26.23]Well, I didn't want to do that.
[70:27.61]Actually, that's kind of better.
[70:30.33]Wait.
[70:39.64]I want to pick this up and move it.
[70:42.71]Hold Alt.
[70:47.47]Oh my god!
[70:48.31]Wait, I could just hold the mouse button down!
[70:51.20]Alright.
[70:54.04]So that- I can put this here then.
[71:00.52]That's definitely better.
[71:05.05]Right in the corner.
[71:07.51]Door will be moved.
[71:09.70]I can get it to move.
[71:11.48]Alright, I gotta go into build mode, right?
[71:12.92]I am in build mode.
[71:14.96]How do I get this to move out of here?
[71:16.16]Oh, there we go.
[71:17.72]Okay.
[71:20.16]And now I want to extend this out.
[71:22.73]This way.
[71:28.01]Can I not extend this out?
[71:32.71]Oh, that's better.
[71:33.19]Alright.
[71:33.57]Now this moves here.
[71:34.33]And the door goes right there.
[71:38.42]Perfect.
[71:38.68]Okay.
[71:39.16]Good.
[71:46.04]And then... Just have a bathroom door.
[71:55.09]Oh, god damn it.
[71:56.15]I gotta delete this thing.
[71:58.09]Okay.
[72:04.74]Do I have a big barn door?
[72:10.78]Hey, no.
[72:11.00]We're going all night.
[72:12.40]So don't worry.
[72:12.82]This stream's not gonna be over in like an hour.
[72:14.96]Don't worry.
[72:19.63]I'm down to play this.
[72:20.43]I'm here.
[72:24.35]I got a nice clean room.
[72:28.67]BB move objects on.
[72:31.08]For the love of God.
[72:31.88]Wait, what happened?
[72:33.12]BB dot move objects on is being spammed.
[72:36.02]What does that mean?
[72:37.56]What is BB dot move objects on?
[72:45.53]Control shift C.
[72:51.29]BB... What am I doing?
[72:54.95]BB dot move objects on.
[73:01.87]What does this do?
[73:10.12]Move objects cheat is on.
[73:15.10]What does it do?
[73:15.60]Did you just back up my achievements?
[73:20.35]You can place objects anywhere.
[73:21.43]Did you just fuck up my achievements?
[73:24.80]I can't get Xbox achievements now.
[73:26.44]Thanks.
[73:28.18]Okay, let's get back to this.
[73:34.90]Kitchen looks good.
[73:36.97]Now we're almost ready to get started.
[73:41.00]Remember, you're making the shittiest house I've ever seen in Sims 4.
[73:43.56]That is a complete fucking lie, considering you've watched other streams of me play this game, and they were way worse.
[73:51.42]There were no windows.
[73:52.76]It was one floor.
[73:54.83]You've seen it before.
[73:55.85]You saw it like a year ago.
[73:57.69]You've already seen me play this.
[73:58.71]This is a major marketed improvement from what I was doing before.
[74:04.61]It's still one floor.
[74:05.69]Oh, yeah?
[74:07.19]Wait till you see what I've learned so far.
[74:09.83]Alright, let's go.
[74:12.15]What about other little things here?
[74:13.49]Fire prevention system utility?
[74:19.85]Nah.
[74:22.31]Gotta have like a plant.
[74:23.59]I don't know.
[74:30.18]A bowl of fruit or whatever that is.
[74:31.18]Who cares?
[74:32.20]Alright.
[74:37.17]Ooh, what's this?
[74:39.45]A basketball.
[74:41.29]Oh!
[74:50.68]Where's the thing that I want?
[74:52.11]The ship wheel.
[75:02.97]What is this?
[75:03.47]No, wheel.
[75:11.06]What?
[75:11.34]I have to be level 4 actor to buy a ship pirate wheel?
[75:35.11]I'm putting this right over the bed.
[75:49.20]Cheat?
[75:49.90]No, I'm not cheating.
[75:52.24]I'm playing this legit.
[76:14.50]Okay.
[76:16.92]Now, I need bathroom stuff.
[76:19.26]I need a light in the bathroom, too.
[76:20.86]I forgot.
[76:27.77]Oh, there it is.
[76:33.09]What the fuck is that?
[76:34.19]Alright.
[76:34.57]No, no.
[76:34.81]We're not doing that.
[76:38.09]We'll do these.
[76:38.82]These are kind of fine.
[76:42.16]Okay.
[76:51.83]That's better.
[76:53.65]Then put a mirror right there.
[76:54.83]And then, I don't know, have something else.
[77:01.96]I need to be an actor level 4.
[77:03.26]That shouldn't take too long, right?
[77:12.85]Alright.
[77:13.11]There's enough light in here.
[77:13.91]I don't care.
[77:16.17]Uh, now I need, uh, toilet.
[77:21.45]Bathroom.
[77:22.51]Toilet.
[77:24.32]Alright, there.
[77:24.84]So... Do you have a public bathroom in the... I want a public bathroom.
[77:31.34]Can I do... How much is this?
[77:32.23]This is $2,700.
[77:33.73]Do you have a public bathroom?
[77:41.68]If you need to go to the bathroom, you go outside.
[77:43.44]Into the public bathroom.
[77:44.80]That's fine.
[77:45.26]I don't care.
[77:46.38]I don't care if I wasted money.
[77:51.70]Dude, why would I even make a bathroom?
[77:53.42]Just put a shower in the corner or something.
[78:03.40]Who's gonna clean this?
[78:04.74]I don't... Me?
[78:12.90]Should I even have a toilet?
[78:16.26]I don't think I buy a toilet.
[78:18.18]If there's just like a full public bathroom over here.
[78:24.29]I'm gonna hold off for now.
[78:27.21]But I'll get a shower.
[78:29.49]Wait, hold on.
[78:32.41]No, I can't have... What?
[78:36.33]Wait, what is this?
[78:37.65]This is no shower?
[78:38.73]You just spray yourself with water in the corner?
[78:44.47]I'm very curious.
[78:46.88]How does this work?
[78:53.04]I need it.
[78:53.62]I need it for now.
[78:54.62]And then we have like a bathtub.
[78:57.02]Running out of money.
[79:09.14]I only have twenty hundred, but alright, I gotta get more essentials.
[79:11.57]Shower, I need a sink.
[79:12.45]Need a mirror.
[79:16.79]Uh, this one's fine.
[79:17.87]Just like a little medicine cabinet, it's fine.
[79:19.23]I need the walls up.
[79:29.37]Whoa, not that much.
[79:32.98]I'm gonna put this on the other wall.
[79:36.14]Eh, fuck it, who cares.
[79:47.01]How do I make this?
[79:48.13]How do I make this lower?
[79:48.81]Yeah, there we go.
[79:55.82]Does this have to be this tall?
[80:09.42]Okay, well, whatever.
[80:10.18]Alright, bathroom's good.
[80:17.80]Oh, I need a door.
[80:19.98]I'll figure that out in a minute.
[80:22.08]Alright, this is the living room slash bedroom slash hangout zone.
[80:27.31]First of all, let's get something out of the way here.
[80:28.79]Let's get a nice rug.
[80:33.19]I like the frog one.
[80:35.69]That's pretty cool.
[80:48.77]That's pretty cool.
[80:54.61]Alright.
[80:55.37]Don't run out of money.
[80:57.50]Why is only half of this house... What is going on here?
[81:01.84]Why did it not paint the whole thing?
[81:03.42]Alright, wait a minute.
[81:05.18]Something's wrong here.
[81:09.59]Oh, it's panels.
[81:11.35]Where is it?
[81:15.87]No, it's siding.
[81:17.03]Where's the siding?
[81:25.77]Can I not do the... Oh, it just looks so weird.
[81:28.23]Okay, that was weird.
[81:30.35]Doesn't even look like the same thing because of the sunlight.
[81:32.61]Alright.
[81:33.97]I need a roof.
[81:34.51]Everyone will yell at me if I don't make one.
[81:35.93]What kind of roof?
[81:38.85]Does this cost money?
[82:09.38]How do I make it so it only... You bet your ass I'm putting a fucking shitload of solar panels on this thing.
[82:31.87]Just make sure to aim it directly to the sun.
[82:35.64]Are there solar panels?
[82:45.60]No.
[82:49.32]What if I'm going to flip it?
[82:50.84]Actually, it wouldn't look so weird if it was flipped.
[82:54.98]And then shrink it.
[83:15.32]They were building two different houses when they got here.
[83:17.56]Alright.
[83:17.94]No, no, no.
[83:18.22]This is wrong.
[83:19.47]Get rid of this.
[83:30.73]I want it to look cool, but I don't want it to be stupid looking.
[83:45.69]Oh my, whatever.
[83:52.63]That's not bad.
[83:53.21]It just needs to be smaller.
[83:58.30]Is it going into the house?
[84:06.46]Wait, the roof is going into the house.
[84:12.78]This is wrong.
[84:17.58]Oh my god.
[84:18.32]Whatever, just do a fucking regular ass roof.
[84:20.04]Who cares?
[84:35.61]Dude, no one even sees this.
[84:38.07]No one even sees this.
[84:40.89]It's never shown.
[84:41.77]It just has to exist.
[84:45.00]So who cares?
[84:46.18]It's never shown.
[84:46.82]It just needs to exist.
[84:52.68]It doesn't matter.
[84:53.62]It exists.
[84:54.32]That's the only thing that matters.
[84:57.82]If it exists.
[84:59.07]I just heard my girlfriend laugh at me.
[85:01.45]I heard her laugh.
[85:02.25]I heard her.
[85:03.29]I could hear it.
[85:04.81]I heard it.

[91:19.87]I'm going to flip it horizontally and people are going to freak out.
[91:28.30]People are going to lose their minds right now.
[91:32.16]No, no, no.
[91:32.68]Top right.

[91:42.55]I'm just going to be flipped.
[91:44.47]Oh, what'd you bring?
[91:49.01]Gourmet fruitcake.
[91:51.90]Why is everybody showing up right now?
[91:54.52]You don't have to knock on the door.
[91:56.32]We're standing.
[91:56.98]Welcome to the neighborhood.
[91:57.86]How do I eat that?
[91:59.04]Alright, invite everybody in.
[92:00.66]Come on in.

[92:13.57]Somebody could literally fall and break their ankle.
[92:16.01]Please get in.
[92:17.03]This is a hazard.
[92:17.69]There's no handrails.
[92:18.67]Someone's going to fall down and get hurt.
[92:23.77]Alright, say hello.
[92:24.82]Come on in.
[92:28.06]Where'd that fruitcake go?
[92:31.78]Where's the fruitcake?
[92:36.06]I don't have a fruitcake in my inventory.
[92:37.79]Give it to me.
[92:42.22]Where is it?
[92:45.50]Pet obsessions.
[92:46.74]Like almost all pets, Yodel can get inexplicably obsessed about things around the house.
[92:50.56]Keep an eye on your furry companion.
[92:51.96]What are you obsessed with?
[92:52.88]A fridge?
[92:53.80]Oh, there it is.
[92:56.45]I'm going to put this in.

[93:02.99]Okay, so I can eat that later.
[93:06.75]Anybody know how to welcome wagon?
[93:11.10]Oh, that's what it is.
[93:13.57]Should I hire staff?
[93:17.67]I'm going to serve brunch.
[93:20.93]Eggs and toast.
[93:21.49]How does this work?
[93:22.29]Is it actually like a subway station?
[93:23.89]This is actually dangerous.
[93:26.19]What am I making?
[93:48.26]Where's the herbs and cheese bread, man?
[93:50.56]Come on.
[93:51.96]Where's the Italian's herbs and cheese?
[94:02.31]Yodel is an active dog.
[94:03.51]They will frequently run around.
[94:04.79]Where'd you go?
[94:07.90]Stay out of there.
[94:09.90]Wait.
[94:10.54]No, no, no, no, no.
[94:11.06]I thought I was controlling the dog.
[94:18.07]Wait.
[94:18.45]Oh, I have a cooking skill.
[94:19.49]You don't like dogs.
[94:20.92]This shit is a fucking mess.
[94:33.12]Wait, I'm... Oh, fuck!
[94:36.27]Fuck!
[94:37.05]How do I help?
[94:38.27]Call the fire department quick!
[94:41.11]Wait, did I save it?
[94:42.19]How do I help?
[94:43.16]How do I help?
[94:57.81]Somebody help!
[94:58.61]What are you standing there for?
[95:00.12]You psychos!
[95:01.84]Somebody help me!
[95:02.80]I'm the new neighbor!
[95:04.12]I'm the new neighbor!
[95:10.65]What do I do?
[95:11.41]Put yourself out, quick!
[95:27.85]Am I alive?
[95:28.69]Am I okay?
[95:31.94]What happened?
[95:32.58]Holy fucking moly!
[95:37.12]I just got money?
[95:39.22]Who's this guy?
[95:40.04]Did I fuck up my entire house already?
[95:45.33]What did he just take a green sludge out of this?
[95:51.39]Why did you just empty a whole can of pee?
[95:53.49]Who are you?
[95:54.07]Why are you in my house?
[95:58.72]I'm venting about this.
[96:02.38]Why would you eat?
[96:03.40]What is the peas for?
[96:04.58]You brought peas?
[96:10.30]You're a lunatic if you bring a bowl of peas to somebody's house.
[96:14.70]Just unprompted.
[96:15.96]Oh, yeah.
[96:16.47]Hey, welcome to the neighborhood.
[96:17.25]I dumped a can of peas in here.
[96:18.79]Can I clean up?
[96:26.38]Who's screaming?
[96:27.06]Do you hear that?
[96:37.94]Oh, you turned the TV on.
[96:39.28]Okay.
[96:42.04]Well, this is obviously destroyed.
[96:44.48]That's great.
[96:45.30]Alright.
[96:45.70]Hey.
[96:49.43]Fear of fire?
[96:50.75]I wonder why he has a fear of fire.
[96:53.77]No shit.
[96:55.49]Um.
[96:56.48]Okay.
[96:59.84]We need to get this sorted.
[97:01.92]First of all, I'm annoyed that you brought him here, but I'm gonna eat the peas.
[97:05.64]Boom!
[97:15.19]This is so weird.
[97:18.94]I am burnt.
[97:20.98]And nobody's picking on.
[97:25.64]Nobody's like caring.
[97:27.72]Send them home.
[97:28.74]Well, I need to make friends in the neighborhood.
[97:33.54]Yeah, I'm the guy that invited everybody over, a new neighbor, and burnt his house down with a fucking grilled cheese or whatever that was.
[97:40.17]I don't even know what that was.
[97:41.31]Eggs or toast?
[97:42.17]I have to delete this stuff, though.
[97:45.25]Should I replace the floor?
[97:47.03]Dude, that's what happens when you just jam...
[98:00.95]God damn it.
[98:01.73]How do I fix this?
[98:02.52]Do I have to clean that?
[98:05.98]Need a dog bowl?
[98:08.02]Oh, fuck.
[98:08.44]You're right.
[98:10.98]Okay.
[98:11.16]Do I have to replace the floor?
[98:12.22]Just put a big rug there.
[98:15.95]No, I have to replace the floor.
[98:29.09]My, like, head hurts.
[98:30.05]That was so fucking funny.
[98:32.34]Okay.
[98:35.64]Uh, what even is the floor here?
[98:39.76]Which one of these?
[98:40.28]I don't remember.
[98:44.80]DIY job.
[98:46.32]Sorry.
[98:51.03]Nah, I don't have a stove.
[98:52.87]Let me clean up first.
[98:53.79]Okay.
[98:59.58]I'm going to take a thoughtful shower after that.
[99:04.63]Extinguish fire.
[99:05.61]Weird.
[99:05.77]Is this going to come out?
[99:07.51]Oh, boy.
[99:08.17]Oh, dear God.
[99:15.63]Oh, my God.
[99:29.73]People can see you.
[99:31.28]What?
[99:32.50]Because of this window.
[99:35.40]Can you?
[99:35.86]No, you can't.
[99:41.92]Oh, you can't.
[99:42.54]Alright.

[100:41.63]Oh, this is a dog bowl.
[100:48.61]This would be right here.
[100:49.37]It's good.
[100:49.69]Alright.
[100:53.77]Are you scared for life?
[100:55.05]I don't know.
[100:55.49]How long does it last?
[100:58.15]57 minutes.
[100:58.41]That's not bad.
[101:01.58]Can somebody fill that?
[101:03.08]When do you guys fill the bowl?
[101:09.23]I'm inspired.
[101:14.49]Maybe next time.

[101:42.28]Okay, I need a trash can.
[101:46.08]And I need a stove.
[101:48.82]Can I even afford a stove?
[101:51.54]I can.
[101:52.23]Alright, this time don't be an idiot.
[101:58.64]Um, okay.
[102:01.22]What else was over here besides the stove?
[102:02.94]Is anything else damaged?
[102:05.18]This shit's so fucked up.
[102:06.22]This stuff's damaged.
[102:06.92]This is damaged.
[102:25.78]Okay, now I just want new counters.

[103:27.66]Alright, nice trash.

[103:31.06]And spin it this way.
[103:35.69]How do I make it so it doesn't do this?
[103:38.77]I thought I had that cheat code on.
[103:43.61]Alt.

[105:30.29]Get in the fucking water, please.
[105:32.81]Oh my god.
[105:33.97]I didn't think he was gonna walk out the front door naked.
[105:38.85]Did he pee?
[105:42.82]What are you doing?
[105:46.13]Go jogging.
[105:48.53]No, he's not going to go jogging like this.
[105:54.82]Bro, you've got to be kidding me.
[105:57.12]You've actually got to be fucking kidding me.
[106:16.03]Go home!
[106:17.49]Go home!
[106:19.15]Go home!
[106:20.29]What is wrong with you?
[106:26.33]Who is this?
[106:32.22]Hello?
[106:32.58]I'm going to introduce... Wait, is this a famous person?
[106:36.40]Ask for a selfie.
[106:37.14]What are you doing?
[106:43.62]What are you calling?
[106:45.62]Who's she calling?
[106:50.17]You need entertainment, dude.
[106:51.97]Where did I go?
[106:52.69]Get over there.
[107:09.63]That's not how I would not introduce myself to a celebrity like that.
[107:14.57]I'd just be like, hey, what's up?
[107:17.31]Okay.
[107:19.77]Global superstar.
[107:24.57]Can I have an autograph?
[107:31.71]Cool.
[107:36.91]No?
[107:37.43]Oh, okay.
[107:39.37]What about, um, can I take a picture?
[107:42.85]Can we have a picture?
[107:48.79]Um.
[107:54.07]What else?
[107:54.95]Alright, well, bye.
[107:57.15]I can't just sit.
[108:02.13]Thank God the fire is out.
[108:03.57]Oh.
[108:06.74]You too.
[108:11.88]Alright, what's wrong with me?
[108:16.61]Oh, you're obsessed with the fridge.
[108:20.71]I forgot.
[108:21.09]There's been a couple of incredibly unhinged things going on in the first 20 minutes of this game.
[108:31.58]We're going to try to dial it back a little.
[108:39.17]So, I need bladder.
[108:43.76]Hunger.
[108:44.84]Don't.
[108:45.22]This time I'm eating a snack.
[108:47.62]I'm eating a microwaved meal.
[108:48.98]We're not touching the stove for a little while.
[108:50.94]We're going to have microwaved chicken nuggets.
[108:55.21]Okay.
[109:00.37]It's like the worst way to make chicken nuggets.
[109:04.25]It's the worst possible way to do that.
[109:13.52]He needs a new.
[109:14.54]Okay.
[109:18.94]So let's do energy.
[109:21.40]Maybe.
[109:24.14]Oh, right.
[109:24.42]This huge bed.
[109:25.32]Can I actually get in it?
[109:38.11]You can't.
[109:38.45]This is not going to have a problem, right?
[109:40.35]It's just microwave chicken nuggets.
[109:42.93]You know where to sit and eat?
[109:45.91]It's okay.
[109:47.19]I only have 300 bucks.
[109:47.95]I need to get a job.
[109:48.75]Or I need to make money somehow.
[109:51.97]For a second, I thought that was the fire alarm.
[109:56.63]No, you can't have any.
[110:00.29]Oh, they suck.
[110:04.89]He hates it.
[110:10.12]Okay, now...
[110:18.44]Why would you do that?
[110:19.55]That was weird.
[110:20.67]That was very weird.
[110:25.47]Who smells their chicken nuggets like that?
[110:28.85]Alright, let's fill the dog bowl.
[110:31.23]This is why I didn't want like 10 cats, guys.
[110:33.40]Because you have to do this.
[110:40.92]Where are you going?
[110:42.42]Where are you going?
[110:43.32]Just running around?
[110:50.24]What else do you need to do?
[110:51.46]Listen to kids music.
[110:52.72]Is there like a... Alright, my energy is kind of low.
[110:57.06]What should I do for... Let me look for a job.
[111:01.71]Where is it?
[111:02.59]Business, right?
[111:04.13]Okay.
[111:04.65]Buy a restaurant.
[111:06.11]Buy a vet clinic.
[111:07.17]Register with the Ministry of Labor.
[111:09.07]What about a job?
[111:11.77]What can I do?
[111:14.58]What should I do?
[111:25.82]Detective, doctor, scientist, or actor is to get... I don't want to be an actor, though.
[111:30.56]Critic?
[111:32.62]Everyone has an opinion, but not everyone is paid to have it.
[111:34.68]Sims who feel they have superior judgment can either enter the critic career.
[111:39.20]Food or the arts?
[111:41.86]Should I be a food critic?
[111:46.96]Culinary, freelancer, gardener, painter.
[111:50.64]Politician, salary person, secret agent.
[111:55.07]A style influencer?
[111:57.37]A babysitter?
[111:59.59]Fast food employee?
[112:01.80]Retail employee?
[112:07.36]Secret agent?
[112:11.08]I don't think this guy is going to be a secret agent.
[112:13.04]No, I need to be a Jedi.
[112:15.77]Can I still be a secret agent and a Jedi?
[112:18.89]Can I be a doctor and a Jedi?
[112:20.11]Does that work?
[112:31.30]Right?
[112:31.90]I could be a doctor and a Jedi.
[112:39.08]Should I be a doctor?
[112:39.78]I feel like doctor's boring to do in The Sims, though.
[112:42.58]That's like, since The Sims 1, that's been a thing you can do.
[112:46.49]Maybe I will do secret agent.
[112:52.71]From infiltrating enemy headquarters to the art of interrogation, the more you learn, the less you'll be known.
[112:58.55]Diamond agent and villain.
[113:01.79]Should I do this?
[113:08.23]Just be a villain?
[113:10.78]Eh, whatever.
[113:11.18]Let's do it.
[113:14.14]Browse intelligence.

[113:32.72]I need a computer.
[113:34.20]Oh, shit.
[113:36.19]Why would you be able to browse intelligence on your phone?
[113:42.27]Please get a dog bed.
[113:43.17]Do I have enough money for a dog bed?
[113:51.58]Oh, yeah, I do.

[114:56.88]Can you even sit on the bed?
[114:58.46]Abimo.
[114:59.76]The bed is way too big.
[115:00.74]Okay, we're going to fix that.
[115:10.30]Did I make it too small?
[115:11.28]Why does it look tiny?
[115:15.00]Am I weird?
[115:21.95]What's wrong?
[115:22.51]This looks so small.
[115:26.65]You should go to bed.
[115:28.45]There we go.
[115:28.81]Okay.

[117:33.30]Eat the- the fruitcake that's in your pocket.
[117:38.30]Quick, eat it!
[117:38.76]Before you go to work!
[117:39.58]Oh, whatever, fine.
[117:44.83]Where are you- where's he going?
[117:46.61]Oh, you're off to work.
[117:48.87]Okay.
[117:50.15]Hack it.
[117:51.21]While performing a routine background check, Lorg runs into an unexpected firewall.
[117:54.99]Hmm.
[117:55.69]He didn't think the information he needed was going to be protected.
[117:58.85]You can either hack through the firewall to dig deeper, or call in a senior.
[118:02.92]I don't hack it.
[118:04.52]I don't have any experience with a computer.
[118:10.42]I'm not going to own a computer.
[118:11.76]I'm going to hack it.
[118:19.20]After some ingenious crypto work, Blorg beats the firewall and discovers that nothing is what it seems.
[118:24.36]He rushes his findings to his boss and it turns out he's uncovered a nefarious plot. $50.
[118:39.63]$50.
[118:39.73]Okay.
[118:46.85]You coming back?
[118:49.55]What's wrong?
[118:51.25]So gross from using the public bathroom.
[118:54.08]Setting foot in that public bathroom may have been a mistake.
[118:59.78]My public bathroom?
[119:01.92]Which public bathroom does he not like?
[119:06.70]The one at work?
[119:10.00]He's got minty fresh teeth.
[119:13.84]What's this?

[121:11.08]People have been saying that the whole stream.
[121:12.70]I don't know why it would be happening.

[159:41.29]Yeah.

[159:44.47]It takes like three days to come back from a house party like this.
[159:48.29]Like you brought like a bunch of people over.
[159:49.59]It takes days to clean this up.
[159:52.48]I appreciate it.

[160:53.52]Alright.
[160:53.98]That was a fun party.
[160:57.62]Now everybody get out.
[161:17.42]I am pissed.
[161:19.04]I want everybody to leave so bad.
[161:20.36]How do I kick everybody out of here?
[161:29.05]What time?
[161:29.61]It is midnight and they're still here.
[161:31.73]This kid's going to my fridge.
[161:34.57]Excuse me.
[161:35.11]What's this?
[161:39.65]Did he pay for that?
[161:40.51]What?

[162:04.42]What is- Oh, it's orange juice.
[162:08.86]Alright.
[162:11.54]I think they took all the dirty dishes.
[162:16.10]And they put them into the fridge.
[162:21.61]because there's nowhere else to put them these people are very comfortable here apparently apparently you're incredibly comfortable to take a bath in my house and I literally we met 12 hours ago
[162:52.15]And you make it a mess.
[162:56.61]It's 1.15 in the morning.
[162:57.51]These people have... Excuse me.
[163:01.27]Why are they still here?
[163:02.71]This guy insulted your dog.
[163:21.10]Wait, he's got a Christmas sweater on!
[163:23.10]He's the only festive one here!
[163:25.52]He's the only one that cares about being festive.
[163:28.04]We're going on 2 o'clock in the morning.
[163:30.74]Um...
[163:47.19]She's trying to get in.
[163:48.47]She's pissed.
[163:49.65]She wanted to get in the bed and got mad because I was on her side of the bed.
[163:54.49]And now she's talking into the mirror.
[164:04.72]What are you doing?
[164:05.32]You're making like a souffle?
[164:07.46]Why are these people just claiming my house?
[164:12.01]What's... Hold on.
[164:12.95]You started making this and... Oh no, this kid has to go to the bathroom.
[164:21.81]I thought he was gonna...
[164:42.21]Everybody has to go so bad.
[164:43.63]I've never seen this happen in The Sims before.
[164:46.81]They usually leave at like 11 o'clock at night.
[165:00.29]They're all here at 3 o'clock.
[165:02.03]Even the kid.
[165:02.59]There's a little kid here at 3 a.m.
[165:07.22]Send them home?
[165:07.74]I already did.
[165:08.24]It said my party wasn't successful.
[165:10.46]Everyone's going to leave now or something.
[165:11.56]They're going to be here until I get up in the morning.
[165:15.38]Oh.
[165:28.91]Are they actually gonna stay here all day?
[165:33.72]All night?
[165:34.20]They have to be very- they have to go- they have to sleep!
[165:37.12]They're making coffee!

[166:00.45]Is it almost time for me to wake up in the morning?
[166:02.17]Is it just a bathhouse?
[166:08.24]I'm actually... I don't understand what's happening right now.
[166:11.34]These people are fighting.
[166:16.01]It's Christmas now.
[166:18.15]Okay, get up, get up, get up.
[166:20.61]Use the bathroom.
[166:21.73]Guys, I can't make them leave.
[166:23.33]There's no send home option.
[166:46.63]They all live here now!
[166:54.16]Go home!
[166:55.58]Stop drinking coffee in my bed!
[166:57.04]They're just like, making me- HEY!
[167:02.94]Alright, get- you're out!

[168:33.37]I seriously thought he was going to pee.
[168:34.53]I thought he was going to go down and take a shit in the presents.
[168:38.46]Party's over.
[168:41.72]Okay.
[168:43.20]Happy birthday.

[169:06.31]Catch Father Winter and ask him for a present to satisfy... He appears at 8pm near fireplaces.
[169:12.62]I'm selling something.
[169:13.48]I'm selling the fucking outhouse.
[169:18.17]We need a fireplace.
[169:19.35]Everyone's gonna be trapped here for some weird reason.
[169:21.65]I need a fireplace.
[169:23.35]We need open presents.
[169:26.86]Okay, presents.
[169:29.36]Open presents and stuff.
[169:30.96]Every... Even cavemen.
[169:32.08]What?
[169:42.03]Click on yourself as an option to make people leave.
[169:48.43]No, there isn't.
[169:49.01]They just won't.
[169:52.20]They're just stuck here forever.
[169:55.84]What is the option?
[169:58.62]To get rid of everybody?
[170:00.10]Actions?
[170:01.06]Form a group?
[170:05.26]Click on the door.
[170:08.56]There is no door.
[170:09.28]I deleted it because the pizza guy couldn't get in.
[170:12.88]They're just drinking coffee and using the microwave and taking a bath in my house.
[170:16.14]I need a- okay.
[170:18.70]I need a uh... I- we're selling- I'm getting rid of this.
[170:24.50]I'm buying one single fucking toilet.
[170:26.42]This thing was like five grand.
[170:29.16]I need a- we need a fireplace for the Santa Claus.
[170:37.15]Just put a regular toilet in here.
[170:40.17]And now I have two thousand more dollars.
[170:43.84]I don't know.
[170:44.30]It's like this chic one.
[170:45.30]Whatever.
[170:48.34]Okay.
[170:51.52]Good to go.
[170:52.64]Now I need a fireplace.
[170:57.38]What's the cheapest one?
[171:01.52]600 bucks.
[171:04.17]This thing's cheap.
[171:05.15]It doesn't matter.
[171:05.73]We just need presents from... There you go.
[171:08.79]Okay.
[171:09.19]I need a door.
[171:11.49]I don't need a door.
[171:14.30]Okay, here we go.
[171:14.96]How do I light the fireplace?
[171:18.72]Can somebody else do it?
[171:21.71]Okay.
[171:40.58]You know what the worst part about this?
[171:41.88]These people won't leave.
[171:43.42]I can't make them leave.
[171:44.42]There's no option to make them leave.
[171:46.12]But yet every time they open the fridge, it deducts $20 from my bank account.
[171:51.32]I am housing 15 people right now.
[171:55.04]And they all have their own houses and I have to- they're spending all my money.
[171:58.15]I need a door.
[172:01.15]I had a door before and it locked us all in.
[172:15.35]They'll leave after Christmas.
[172:18.56]Buy a real door.
[172:21.84]Change the door.
[172:22.70]I will.
[172:23.00]Bloggers learn the trade.
[172:24.98]Mean.
[172:28.70]Somebody left.
[172:31.19]Holy shit.
[172:32.51]Somebody got out.
[172:35.13]Somebody actually got out.
[172:38.91]Where are you going is the real question.
[172:48.36]The most festive person didn't wait for Santa Claus.
[172:52.64]Without a door, your house is a public place.
[172:55.78]What?
[173:04.51]It's a public place?
[173:08.18]Even if it is a public place, why are they here for two straight days?
[173:11.12]They would have left.
[173:27.56]You wouldn't stay in a public place for two days.
[173:29.26]I have a door now.
[173:36.83]Now click it.
[173:46.18]What's wrong with this roof?
[173:49.30]We need to clean up.
[173:55.32]I'm waiting for- I'll order another pizza.
[173:58.26]People stop opening the fridge, I'm gonna order a pizza.
[174:01.39]Dog needs a bath.
[174:22.43]Didn't I pick this up off the floor?
[174:24.19]Why am I eating this?
[174:30.84]How did I get 800?
[174:31.32]Oh, because I sold the public bathroom.
[174:35.26]Coffee maker is broken.
[174:42.08]Just get another one.
[174:42.72]I don't care.
[174:43.14]Invite a werewolf.
[174:53.33]Um, hold on.
[174:56.17]I need to wait for Santa to come.
[174:59.53]Can somebody else light this, though?
[175:00.91]Click door and say no trespasses.
[175:12.70]Well, I don't want to dis- I don't want to disallow everybody.
[175:15.92]This is not how you do it.
[175:21.43]I don't want to disallow neighbors.
[175:23.71]I want them to be able to come over, but... Ask to leave under friendly.
[175:42.51]Something that's really... This whole routine of making a coffee and taking a bath...
[175:49.63]My water bill is going to be crazy this week.
[175:51.33]This month.
[175:55.15]I don't understand how none of them have gone to sleep.
[175:56.83]None of them have slept in two days.
[175:57.99]Galorg is a lazy sim.
[176:03.11]They like watching TV.
[176:04.33]Alright, let me do the daughter bath.
[176:13.33]Alright, stop watching TV and you gotta do some stuff.
[176:15.65]Clean up.
[176:15.97]Take a bath.
[176:16.67]Exercising.
[176:17.27]Let me guess, you're gonna open the fridge and take something out.
[176:24.58]You're gonna charge me $20.
[176:46.35]Look, I'm giving the dog a bath right now.
[176:48.41]You can't... Is Santa actually going to appear?
[176:51.24]Yeah, if you have a fireplace, which I do, and it's 8 p.m.
[176:54.32]That's the only reason why I haven't kicked everybody out yet.
[176:57.22]I mean, they're just here.
[177:07.33]I need to go to sleep.
[177:10.69]Sleep.
[177:13.11]Sleep.
[177:13.39]Move out of the way.
[177:14.21]Everyone get out of the way.
[177:15.21]You can talk in the other room.
[177:20.82]Stop.
[177:21.64]Get away from my bed.
[177:28.12]What a rush.
[177:28.62]The boost of adrenaline is making Blorg feel amazing.
[177:31.20]Should he finally embrace it with his astonishingly sculpted arms that he likes fitness?
[177:34.98]No.
[177:37.85]No.
[177:38.87]What's that mean?
[177:39.57]Okay, this person's cooking.
[177:42.65]Should we sing together again?
[177:56.11]Plus one future cube?
[178:03.15]What?
[178:05.33]I got a future cube?
[178:06.45]Quick yourself.
[178:15.90]Guys, there is no make people leave.
[178:18.02]The game is broken.
[178:21.36]And I was waiting for Santa to show up before I reload the game and kick everybody out.
[178:25.93]Somebody else left.
[178:32.88]We were so close to Santa.
[178:35.52]Alright, so the cube.
[178:38.20]Where's the cube?
[178:38.70]It's on the counter.
[178:55.17]Alright, everybody ready?
[178:58.89]Santa will be showing up very soon.
[179:02.90]Hoppleborf na boo-voo Hoppleborf na boo-voo Hoppleborf na fleep sim zoo Hoppleborf na fleep voo Hoppleborf na boo-voo Hoppleborf na boo-voo Hoppleborf na fleep sim zoo Hoppleborf na fleep voo Hoppleborf na boo-voo Hoppleborf na boo-voo
[179:36.37]Worst party ever.
[179:41.19]Will he be brave enough to throw another party after how badly this one went?
[179:47.87]But Santa hasn't even showed up yet.
[179:53.20]They're all actually leaving right before the big moment where Santa comes.
[179:59.00]You've been here for three days.
[180:01.46]Three days.
[180:06.14]At least you're still here.
[180:13.01]I'm sorry for that party.
[180:14.19]It was so bad.
[180:17.04]It was an awful party.
[180:18.26]What do you need?
[180:21.46]What's wrong now?
[180:22.50]Okay, how about... Let's sing another song.
[180:24.71]We can sing pop songs duet with other Sims.
[180:47.47]Hold on, no, no, no, no, no.
[180:52.57]We're not doing that.
[180:53.27]Give a gift.
[180:55.85]Give a Winterfest gift.
[180:59.43]Oh, all I have is dog shit.
[181:00.65]Alright, a ball, a wooden children's toy, an apple, a toddler's book, or the fruitcake that's been old that I made, that I got for a welcome present like a month ago.
[181:15.34]Which one?
[181:16.50]The apple?
[181:18.08]Imagine getting an apple for a present.
[181:23.41]Just one apple.
[181:25.85]A single apple.
[181:29.27]Maybe the wooden toy?
[181:30.23]Merry Christmas.
[181:42.87]What's in it?
[181:45.16]My specialty.
[181:48.86]You know how much this fucking place is worth?
[181:57.78]Worth a lot of money.
[181:58.80]We're out on the beach.
[182:07.57]Ask what happened.
[182:09.95]Can you turn the stove on or whatever?
[182:11.95]Hey, Blork, you're so notorious that one of my unscrupulous friends has been asking to meet you.
[182:16.07]Can I give them your number?
[182:16.95]What do you mean notorious?
[182:21.30]What does that mean?
[182:21.92]I guess... No.
[182:30.34]Oh, coffee?
[182:31.02]Yep.
[182:31.76]Okay, we only have a couple hours until Santa shows up.
[182:39.82]She's pissed.
[182:44.99]Let's do, um... Let's talk about... Should we just laugh together?
[182:50.81]Belly laugh?
[182:57.46]Tanta's gonna show up very soon.
[182:59.06]Ho, ho, ho!
[183:04.66]Ha, ha, ha, ha!
[183:06.58]Ha, ha!
[183:07.74]Nob, sir.
[183:12.30]This dog looks like a sock puppet.
[183:16.39]Okay, how about... How about...
[183:26.24]Um, something just friendly.
[183:29.52]New show.
[183:30.06]There's a new show on TV.
[183:31.24]Let's talk about the new show.
[183:32.87]I think that makes sense, right?
[183:35.07]Alright.
[183:35.59]All we drink is coffee.
[183:37.07]I have to extinguish a fire.
[183:40.49]Okay.
[183:41.17]Okay.
[183:55.74]About, um, complain about Winterfest.
[183:57.76]I wouldn't want to.
[183:58.50]Why would I do that?
[184:00.56]Having it been a personal emergency and I have to leave.
[184:02.74]What?
[184:04.67]What is it?
[184:05.07]Emergency?
[184:19.22]What?
[184:19.52]Hey, plug, I've heard a lot about you.
[184:21.70]Mostly bad things, but that's okay.
[184:22.92]People usually don't like me either.
[184:24.66]We should hang out sometime.
[184:28.32]You want to come over for Christmas?
[184:41.25]Who was that?
[184:44.47]Who was that?
[184:53.83]Santa's gonna show up in two hours.
[184:55.01]Come on over.
[185:02.33]Grace will be right over, alright?
[185:05.23]Quick, I gotta use the bathroom.
[185:06.31]No, don't go to bed after inviting someone.
[185:07.97]Drink a coffee and go to the bathroom.
[185:13.27]That was quick.
[185:15.45]I didn't even invite you in.
[185:16.85]We just walked in the house.
[185:18.49]Oh my goodness.
[185:30.07]How you doing?
[185:30.51]Alright, what about like mischief?
[185:37.41]Incoming phone call.
[185:41.07]Hey Blorg, I've been thinking about getting to know Nina Caliente better as a friend.
[185:45.36]Do you think the two of us should... Why are you calling me?
[185:50.78]Don't ever call this number again.
[185:52.26]Alright, let's make a coffee and then we'll be ready for Santa.
[186:03.25]said anything.

[187:00.13]Just for a minute.
[187:05.92]Wait, wait, wait, don't leave, don't leave.

[189:07.69]Let's get that pizza.
[189:08.85]Why does this keep happening?
[189:12.95]The door is locked?
[189:14.35]People have been walking in and out of this door.
[189:36.08]Hector Laurent is not here.
[189:38.38]Is he?
[189:40.40]Where is he?

[190:39.78]He's going to leave it on the ground.
[190:40.86]And Sam's going to take it and then leave.
[190:42.72]And then I'm going to go back to work tomorrow.
[190:46.30]This nightmare can finally end.
[190:48.91]But there are presents in here.

[191:10.08]Oh, that was rude.
[191:11.64]That was rude.
[191:12.32]What I meant to say was thank you so much, Santa, for the gift.
[191:15.66]I can't get the pizza.
[191:18.86]I can't get the pizza.
[191:20.92]I'm locked inside of my house, apparently.
[191:25.49]I can't...

[192:32.28]Put it in the fridge.
[192:34.48]Can I finally... Alright, we're good.

[198:53.65]I did everything.
[198:59.67]Get some sleep.
[199:01.35]Go to the bathroom, get some sleep, and then take a shower.
[199:08.37]What the hell is that?
[199:10.93]Alright.

[199:17.46]I need a computer.
[199:20.00]Eventually.
[199:20.46]After I get back from work, I'm going to get a computer.
[199:27.24]Because I have some secret agent.
[199:32.34]I got to get this.
[199:33.14]This is way too goopy.
[199:34.46]It was weird.
[199:36.77]This is super goopy.
[199:37.69]It's spreading too much.
[199:38.93]This is goopy.
[199:44.56]Oh my god, why is it... I don't... That one's goopy.
[199:51.78]I don't like that one.
[199:53.89]Winterfest was... What did it say?
[199:55.43]Winterfest was pretty good.
[199:56.57]Blore got to do a lot of things he wanted to do, but not everything.
[199:59.23]Next year he hopes he can do even more.
[200:03.39]That's fine.
[200:03.85]OK.
[200:05.71]Get some sleep.
[200:06.72]You need to eat.
[200:10.72]And then I'm going to get to bed and I got to get up in five hours to go to work.
[200:15.20]What's wrong with me?
[200:17.64]Something was gross.
[200:23.54]How do you upgrade the bed?
[200:24.88]Alright, let's go.
[200:27.57]Oh, geez.
[200:36.79]We're good.

[200:51.34]What do you mean?
[200:51.68]What?
[200:51.88]Did I just miss work?
[200:59.74]Who's calling me?
[201:00.34]I literally hung up on you.
[201:02.10]I hung up on that guy.
[201:03.24]Okay, we're good.
[201:04.64]The person made that up.
[201:05.52]Uncomfortable.
[201:06.26]Too many Sims.
[201:24.57]Is there coffee brewing?
[201:27.23]Alright, $123.
[201:29.73]Clean up the coffee maker.
[201:32.29]Take a shower.
[201:34.00]And then I need to get a computer and I need to do this, whatever this skill is.
[201:37.06]Browse intelligence.
[201:39.10]I'm ready for promotion.
[201:39.98]Look at this.
[201:44.88]Oh, hello.

[227:45.66]Order food from Docking Bay 7.
[227:47.20]Is this Docking Bay 7?
[227:54.80]Ask about the resistance.
[228:02.01]Yeah, you know, if I had the mods where people could get hit by cars, can you imagine just... How would this even happen?

[228:15.67]Outpost Popcorn, Rising Moons, Overnight Oats.
[228:19.67]That's what I'm going to have.
[228:23.29]Add that mod immediately.
[228:24.49]Look, we're going to do normal for a little while, and then I promise I will put on all the clown mods.
[228:31.48]They'll all go on in the next day.
[228:33.14]Just let me play The Sims normally.
[228:35.80]It's been very abnormal so far, but, you know, we're doing clown mods.

[229:28.00]Stormtrooper?
[229:43.71]How do I join the First Order?
[229:44.71]I want to be a Sith.
[229:52.08]What is that?

[230:05.72]You got it.
[230:12.93]I'm going to freshen up.
[230:13.91]Alright, freshen up the dwelling.
[230:15.37]Where's my dwelling?
[230:16.07]Over here?
[230:20.20]How long am I on vacation for?
[230:24.08]And where is Santa?
[230:24.98]Okay, freshen up.
[230:30.02]Okay, I got to plan my outfit.
[230:35.89]Plan Batuu outfit.
[230:39.37]Alright.
[230:40.87]Not such a bee, Obi.
[231:27.33]Where are fucking plants?
[231:38.52]I won't- Oh my god.
[231:45.00]That's fine, I can stay like that.
[231:46.09]Did I get- I got bigger by coming to this Batuu world?
[232:07.56]I want to be in a stormtrooper outfit.
[232:32.08]Whatever, this is fine.
[232:33.22]I don't care.
[232:44.85]Alright, now I need to order food from Docking Bay 7.
[232:49.99]Which... That's... Order food from Docking Bay 7.
[232:54.11]Alright, there it is.
[232:54.62]Do I have to go... I can't go in here?
[233:00.22]Okay.
[233:06.81]Okay, I want a Braised Shack Roast.
[233:11.95]Please?
[233:15.54]I want a single serving of that.
[233:18.80]Ask about the first order, ask about the resistance.
[233:23.28]What if I have no money left?
[233:31.26]This feels like one of those information games about the movie that comes in the DVD.
[233:36.65]You know, there's two DVDs.
[233:39.79]And you go, oh, ask about the first order.
[233:43.15]And it's going to give you little tidbits about
[233:47.57]Like the story of the DVD that you just got.
[233:49.57]This is a DVD.
[233:52.21]This is a DVD game.
[233:56.93]I wonder what happens if I ask about the first order.
[234:02.85]Come here.
[234:03.13]I just want a lightsaber for my house.
[234:08.83]OK.
[234:15.19]Visit every neighborhood on... What the hell?
[234:18.11]No, don't leave.
[234:20.11]You learned how to... What do you mean I learned how to make braised shack roast?
[234:24.47]Isn't that a made-up animal?
[234:27.21]That animal doesn't make... That's not a real animal.
[234:30.53]How would I have learned the recipe?
[234:34.31]Is this a... Hold on.
[234:35.57]Is this a vacation spot in The Sims, like it's pretending to be Disney?
[234:39.14]Or is this... You're actually on Batuu.
[234:43.84]It's just a Disneyland.
[234:44.76]This is not supposed to be... Oh, where's Kylo Ren?
[235:09.67]Where's Santa?
[235:10.07]That's kind of what I was singing.
[235:12.23]Come back here.
[235:12.85]I need to talk to you more about the rest of this fucking DVD package ad part of DLC.
[235:18.44]Come here.
[235:40.30]Can you tell me some more about the world of Star Wars?
[235:51.45]Ask about the First Order.
[235:52.21]Okay, I need to talk to Lieutenant Agnon in the First Order District.
[236:04.21]Ask about the Resistance.
[236:06.19]Three times.
[236:12.43]I'm so annoying to this person.
[236:13.89]Does this person work here?
[236:16.21]Is that what's implied?
[236:24.61]Okay, scoundrels.
[236:34.36]Vile scum are definitely on Batuu.
[236:35.92]If you see anything suspicious, report to the First Order.
[236:42.79]Hey, can I tell you about my dreams?
[236:47.55]I had a dream about a green alien.
[236:51.45]It bit me.
[236:52.24]It bit me in the face.
[236:53.92]And then I woke up.
[236:54.80]I was sweating.
[236:56.36]No, scoundrels.
[236:57.12]Okay, on.
[237:06.37]The festival of snow has started.
[237:08.61]No, I don't care.
[237:09.71]I'm on vacation.
[237:11.53]Okay, I have to go to find this lieutenant.
[237:13.23]Okay, cool.
[237:16.59]I'm having fun on vacation.

[237:41.14]Let's go do the first order.
[237:42.60]Why are you so red?
[237:43.38]I don't know.
[237:43.87]I've been trying to figure that out for the last four hours.
[237:48.37]Alright, first order discharge.
[237:53.28]I see why people say this is the worst expansion.

[238:20.81]How much was this one?
[238:21.74]I don't know.

[238:28.20]Spread the word about our vision of the future for Black Spire Outpost.
[238:31.44]Citizens must understand that everything we do is for their own good.

[239:01.89]This is a really unpopular park.
[239:09.51]Why is nobody here?
[239:10.47]There's no other Sims here.
[239:15.43]How do I spread propaganda?
[239:21.84]Wait, do I have to... Do I take this back to the regular Sims world?
[239:25.84]Should I give Santa propaganda?

[243:46.23]The internet doesn't work for like 40 minutes.
[243:50.07]Uh-oh.
[243:55.13]We all know what that means.
[243:55.95]Alright, I need propaganda.
[244:11.64]Yeah, we just gotta ride out the storm here.
[244:15.32]For about 40 minutes.
[244:21.60]We're gonna be dropping some frames.
[244:22.60]It's just how it is, for some reason, randomly on random... What is today?
[244:25.98]What's today's date?
[244:28.46]Tuesday?

[244:51.43]Check your Sims inventory.
[245:01.29]Ooh, did I get a blaster?
[245:11.74]Fake ID card.
[245:15.18]Why do I have a fake ID?
[245:19.76]Alright, I got it now.
[245:22.28]Oh my god, this is gonna take way longer.
[245:28.00]I thought that was gonna be a full cube.
[245:30.38]It's alright.
[245:31.72]Well, the internet sucks.
[245:32.83]Don't worry.
[245:34.23]We'll tank it.
[245:35.85]I can cheat?
[245:46.35]I can... Oh, that's right.
[245:47.21]I can cheat.
[245:53.45]marry an alien let me become friends with with an alien because I'm very curious if these people do they exist in the kind of real world like Earth or I don't know where we are can I make friends with this person
[246:25.34]Okay, so I'm getting a relationship status.
[246:33.51]Wait, I know them now.
[246:36.47]Okay, so can I invite them to parties and stuff?
[246:51.76]Are you recording this from a McDonald's?
[246:54.10]No, it's just randomly at some... Dude, I wish I could tell you how this is even possible.
[246:59.36]So... This is the most ridiculous, bizarre thing.
[247:04.17]So, do you age here?
[247:05.15]I don't know.
[247:07.27]So, from 730 to like 750.
[247:08.11]Or 730 to like 8.
[247:08.67]My internet goes to fucking like 1% speeds.
[247:17.37]And then it goes back to 1,000, 1,000 for the rest of the day, all day.
[247:21.37]It doesn't make any sense.
[247:22.75]It makes no sense.
[247:26.01]It goes from 1,000, 1,000 at, like, 729 to 1 megabit per second at 730 exactly.
[247:33.84]And then at, like, 820 PM, it goes right back to 1,000, 1,000.
[247:37.92]It doesn't make any sense.
[247:42.04]Alright, I need to go to the bathroom.
[247:47.95]But this is why, so another reason why I wanted to start my streams.
[247:50.47]What was that?
[247:57.07]It's like an alarm.
[247:58.57]Alright, I need to use the bathroom.
[248:00.75]Where's the bathroom?
[248:10.09]Where is the bathroom?
[248:11.35]Oh, it's right here.
[248:22.61]Alright, so how do I, um, how do I cheat to get myself, like, plus five, uh, first order points?
[248:28.27]Does anybody have the, uh, code?
[248:48.28]I'll show, I'll show that tomorrow.
[248:50.28]I'll show that tomorrow.
[248:52.65]New viewers, I have probably never seen that picture, and I'll show it tomorrow.
[249:04.64]Alright, so what's the cheat?
[249:09.94]Yeah, I'll be live tomorrow.
[249:16.96]And tomorrow, I'll put mods on tomorrow.
[249:19.21]But I'm going to make them, we're going to do them slowly.
[249:23.33]It's not just going to be everyone gets hit by a car and everybody gets hurt.
[249:27.62]It's going to be slow.
[249:28.36]We're going to just very slowly get into it.
[249:31.78]Okay, what is it?
[249:45.14]Okay, it's control shift C, enter testingcheats true.
[249:50.84]And then shift click your SIM and do give all items.
[249:56.02]Testingcheats true and then shift click and give all items.
[249:58.66]I mean, I gotta read this again.
[250:06.01]Shift C, testingcheats true.
[250:12.46]true just click your sim ah two cheats okay this expansion sucks that's but that's not fair it's it's cool if you're a big Star Wars fan I'm a big I I would probably like this at least I don't know like what I you just walk around and like talk to people

[250:41.63]It's alright.

[251:46.90]I didn't want every single item.
[251:55.27]How do I take this out?
[251:59.93]How do I use my lightsaber?
[252:11.33]You're a lightsaber hilt collection.
[252:13.01]You don't use a lightsaber.
[252:14.33]What do you mean you don't use a lightsaber?
[252:19.51]I need a crystal.
[252:24.43]You have to make it.
[252:25.07]Where do I go to do that?
[252:27.93]I have to drag it out.
[252:44.27]You need to build the lightsaber?
[252:48.83]It's furniture.
[252:57.54]It's just a piece of furniture?
[252:59.66]Okay.
[253:03.62]Alright, Santa, let's get out of here.
[253:05.88]It's time to go home, Santa.

[253:12.38]Let's leave.
[253:13.36]It's time to leave.

[253:19.22]I can't leave.
[253:31.45]Check Santa's ID.
[253:39.09]Upes.
[253:42.45]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[253:43.71]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[253:44.69]What are you doing?

[254:24.56]Santa knocked me out.
[254:25.70]Oh!
[254:26.72]Oh!
[254:38.19]No, keep that out.
[254:39.37]Don't put that up.
[254:40.27]Keep it out.
[254:56.06]Train with lightsaber.
[255:09.32]2 FPS Andy.
[255:10.58]Fuck!
[255:11.14]I know.
[255:11.80]Shit!
[255:13.16]God damn it!
[255:13.86]I got to my favorite part of the entire day.
[255:19.59]Alright.
[255:21.21]You know what?
[255:21.77]I think I'm going to throw an audible out here.
[255:25.13]I think... Alright.
[255:26.29]Here's what I think is going to happen.
[255:27.11]Alright.
[255:28.75]Here's what's happening.
[255:30.43]We're going to call it right now.
[255:31.35]I'm going to be back tomorrow early.
[255:33.01]Like in the morning.
[255:33.59]And we're going to go all day.
[255:38.14]I think that's the plan.
[255:39.86]I think that's the plan.
[255:40.66]The plan is I gotta start early.
[255:41.78]I'm starting at 3 o'clock tomorrow.
[255:43.07]I'm starting at like noon tomorrow.
[255:46.23]And we're gonna play this all day.
[255:47.37]I'm gonna put mods on it.
[255:48.59]And we'll take it from there.
[255:50.89]I gotta start early.
[255:51.79]I gotta start earlier.
[255:53.90]We gotta avoid the 7.30pm internet meltdown.
[256:02.98]So if I start at noon tomorrow, between 12 and 1, then we can stream for 6 or 7 hours and completely avoid it.
[256:10.21]I think that's the play.
[256:13.35]And hold me to this.
[256:14.71]Hold me to this.
[256:15.85]I want you to seriously hold me to this.
[256:17.81]Because I can't start at 3 o'clock in the afternoon Pacific.
[256:20.55]I can't.
[256:23.93]The streams have to be earlier.
[256:26.78]The streams have to be earlier.
[256:30.91]There's no way you're starting at noon.
[256:32.45]I have to, though, because we hit the 7.30 p.m.
[256:36.34]hard turn off.
[256:40.62]And I also called my ISP.
[256:44.18]Where am I?
[256:44.54]Alright, let me save this.
[256:50.57]I'm going to save this.
[256:51.31]We're saving it.
[256:51.87]We're going to start fresh and early tomorrow.
[256:56.01]Come to the flea market with me.
[256:57.33]I don't have time to do this right now.
[257:00.21]We're gonna start fresh tomorrow.
[257:01.43]Early.
[257:03.28]Starting at noon.
[257:06.92]And we're going until the internet turns us off.
[257:15.45]I'm glad we got to go at least for four and a half hours.
[257:17.19]That's fun.
[257:21.41]I'll be back tomorrow.
[257:28.12]And...
[257:29.94]For those of you that have been watching for a long time, I mean, you know, it's kind of frame ratey.
[257:36.91]Yeah, well, I'll be live tomorrow.
[257:38.27]Don't worry.
[257:38.71]We'll go for about six or seven hours.
[257:41.23]There were a lot of people here today, too.
[257:42.65]If you stuck around from the Among Us thing, that's where a lot of people came from, then cool.
[257:49.21]I hope you enjoyed the stream.
[257:51.43]I had a really fun time.
[257:52.63]The first four hours of the stream were really funny.
[257:54.35]I had a lot of fun.
[257:56.49]We'll see you tomorrow.
[258:00.98]But, what's this?
[258:03.73]Those of you, hey, how many old viewers from like 2016, 2017?
[258:07.31]Are you ready?
[258:08.01]You ready for this?
[258:32.50]it's back and the music's back too give you a little bit of channel nostalgia right here we go
[258:56.79]You know what's really funny about this?
[258:58.99]This is what's supposed to be every single end of the stream.
[259:02.57]And I just didn't put the file in OBS.
[259:06.65]I just had to drag it over here.
[259:09.15]And it was just in a folder.
[259:10.99]I just didn't do it.
[259:15.78]But thanks for watching, everybody.
[259:18.96]I would have liked to have gone for another hour or so.
[259:20.96]At least five hours or so.
[259:21.90]But, you know, I gotta beat the internet.
[259:26.56]So all streams, if I want to have five to six hour streams, all streams until further notice have to start at between 12 and one.
[259:44.67]Pacific.
[259:47.07]So that's the plan.
[259:53.25]such a weird problem because sometimes we'll be live at 7 8 p.m without a single problem it's so weird because in like an hour or so I'll do a speed test and it'll just be a thousand a thousand so it's just so random you're moving the goalposts already no no no I between 12 and 12 30 pacific tomorrow is what I'm going to turn the stream on
[260:17.41]I actually felt pretty good today, so I'm glad that I was... Because I'll be honest, during the Among Us stream, I never really wanted to do that.
[260:24.44]That was super important, because I thought it was a really fun kind of idea, just to do that one day.
[260:30.22]But after that stream, that was the middle of COVID, I was like, I gotta go lie down.
[260:41.30]See you at three.
[260:43.14]No, I can't.
[260:44.42]I can't start at three because that means that I'm giving myself a limit of a large percent chance that it's going to be a four hour stream.
[260:53.44]I got to pull it back to at least one because then it's guaranteed to be at least a five to six hour stream before we hit that kind of period at about seven o'clock, 730.
[261:09.13]But thanks for watching.
[261:10.69]See you tomorrow.
[261:12.93]Have a great night.
[261:14.27]Thanks for sticking around.
[261:14.93]See you soon.
[261:17.51]More Sims 4 tomorrow.
[261:18.68]I'll probably add a few mods, but I don't want to go crazy with it.
[261:23.32]Hold me to that.
[261:24.76]No more cheating.
[261:26.20]I wanted the lightsaber, I know, but no more cheating.
[261:29.40]Only slightly funny mods.
[261:31.91]And I'm going to go on a snow trip tomorrow.
[261:33.41]I'm going to go on a ski trip.
[261:38.25]I'll see you later.
[261:40.29]Have a good night, guys.
[262:37.64]you
[263:12.51]you
