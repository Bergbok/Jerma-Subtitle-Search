[00:08.76]Listen, I don't want any trouble.
[00:10.93]I damn well showed you, didn't I?
[00:13.21]Well, the guy in the striped shirt's a real cocky asshole, huh?
[00:16.83]I wonder how we're gonna deal with this situation, hmm?
[00:19.27]Could you guess?
[00:20.53]We're gonna fucking... Hi, guys.
[00:30.92]Hey, I knew I don't know how to play golf.
[00:32.72]Who wants to teach me how to play?
[00:35.15]How you doing?
[00:36.88]Yes, I'm done.
[00:37.72]I play.
[00:38.42]That's one game.
[00:39.24]Who wants to play another game?
[00:40.94]I play golf now.
[00:41.72]There's this.
[00:43.14]There's a hole in one.
[00:44.42]And there's a hole in two.
[00:47.50]And then there's a hole in three.
[00:52.08]Damn!
[00:53.32]Oh, alright.
[00:53.96]Alright, that's two.
[00:55.24]That's double points, right?
[00:57.14]Alright, I'll take it.
[00:57.88]I'll take it.
[00:59.10]Now, I'm gonna smash up somebody's car.
[01:02.65]Or I'll just miss.
[01:03.43]Hit the fucking car!
[01:05.29]No!
[01:06.89]I'm sorry!
[01:09.83]I didn't mean to!
[01:12.22]I'm dead!
[01:15.18]Let's get this shot lined up.
[01:17.54]No more messing around.
[01:18.38]We're gonna play golf.
[01:21.12]That was the wrong club.
[01:22.72]I didn't mean to use the sand wedge on the tee.
[01:26.12]Step aside, my boy.
[01:27.36]Let me show you how a real golf pro does it.
[01:30.30]Yes, watch the ball gracefully fly through the air.
[01:34.81]225 yards.
[01:35.89]That's a new record for me.
[01:37.83]You should probably take notes.
[01:47.27]So this is what you're supposed to wear to the golf course, right?
[01:50.47]Like a dress?
[01:52.91]You're a joker.
[01:56.08]Call the cops.
[01:56.78]Yeah, we'll try it.
[02:00.22]She's actually going to call the cops.
[02:05.20]Are you kidding me?
[02:06.32]What?
[02:07.85]I seriously have a star right now because I'm wearing a dress.
[02:13.86]I honestly cannot believe that there's police swarming this area right now because there's a man in a fucking dress.
[02:21.29]Like, really?
[02:21.99]This is what we're- this is like, this illegal?
[02:24.47]It's this illegal?
[02:25.81]To wear a dress?
[02:27.07]I'm not putting one on ever again.
[02:29.36]That means I put dresses on, but I'm just kidding, don't worry.
[02:33.26]Alright, let's do this!
[02:34.26]Let's go golfing again, my friend.
[02:35.80]Where'd you go?
[02:36.22]What?
[02:41.39]Alright, let's get in.
[02:45.37]What the fuck is happening to this guy?
[02:47.05]He's in like another dimension.
[02:51.16]Is he right?
[02:51.92]Can I run him over?
[02:55.90]This guy is in like the stomach punch dimension.
[03:00.28]Can I... I'm not doing that.
[03:02.54]I...
