[00:08.65]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.15]Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolution.
[00:13.25]This is the remaining footage I had before the holiday rush, which is why you haven't seen very much Hitman on this channel lately.
[00:19.60]And I want to tell you what I'm planning on doing with this series.
[00:22.94]To make this go a little faster and a little more smoothly, I'm going to livestream the rest of this game.
[00:28.74]You will know.
[00:29.30]There will be plenty of announcements.
[00:30.41]I'll put it on Twitter and on my Steam group.
[00:32.39]On YouTube, there'll be an announcement saying I'm streaming Hitman.
[00:35.35]And what I'm going to do with that footage, the footage that I get from the livestream, is going to come over here in full, unedited, onto YouTube.
[00:44.08]So you might see an episode of Hitman Absolution that is like an hour and 45 minutes long, but it will be... like five or six missions in a row.
[00:51.23]And I feel like that's a better way to do this because a lot of you guys want to see episodes more frequently and I feel like this is the best way to do it.
[00:58.69]So rather than have you guys have to wait like four or five days for another 15 minute episode, I can throw up a super episode.
[01:05.69]And then you guys can dictate when you want to watch it, how long you want to watch it.
[01:10.00]Do you want to watch like 20 minutes of it here and then wait like till later tonight, later tomorrow, whatever- to watch the rest of it?
[01:14.00]I can dictate that up to you guys.
[01:16.70]And there will be no ads during the middle of it.
[01:18.26]There's just going to be one ad in the beginning and one ad in the end.
[01:20.60]I'm not going to throw, like, ten ads in the middle of the video, so don't worry about that.
[01:24.41]I just feel like this is a better way for me to be able to get this series out to you guys quicker.
[01:28.97]And as always, please let me know what you think in the comments section if you like this idea.
[01:32.49]And I'm going to let the live commentary play out now.
[01:34.84]This is, like I said, just the tail end of the last remaining footage I had before I decided to do this change.
[01:41.66]So I'll see you guys all soon.
[01:43.32]Take care, everybody, and enjoy the show.
[01:49.44]Are they going to run away or what?
[01:54.48]Go secure the top floor like you were just asked to.
[01:57.34]Good.
[02:01.90]Let's go out here.
[02:06.22]And... Make it out of the crowd.
[02:10.35]Oh, I'm in the crowd, baby.
[02:15.15]Stand still to hide in the crowd.
[02:19.11]Alright.
[02:20.89]Use control to see the crowd that's hiding you.
[02:23.80]Oh, it's this crowd.
[02:24.74]Okay.
[02:27.14]Let's keep going.
[02:28.04]Where's the exit?
[02:28.54]Over here?
[02:28.86]Walk my way over through this crowd.
[02:38.16]Stand in this one.
[02:39.10]Police officer over there.
[02:40.04]I think I can make it to this one, maybe.
[02:42.53]That's gonna be tough.
[02:45.31]Hey guys, how are you?
[02:47.34]We're all waiting for the train to get out.
[02:48.84]That's a fast train!
[02:52.06]That thing just went 5,000 miles per hour over here.
[02:58.19]I mean, like, play the video game.
[03:01.33]Alright, that's good.
[03:09.89]Mmm, there's a cop over there.
[03:11.65]That's alright.
[03:14.44]And there's a cop over on that side.
[03:18.95]Gotta go up.
[03:20.93]How am I supposed to go up?
[03:32.30]Can go in here, but there's a cop in here.
[03:36.94]Something gonna happen here?
[03:37.68]Is this guy gonna come out?
[03:38.80]Hmm.
[03:48.83]What does that say?
[03:49.33]You might... What does that say?
[03:51.21]This might... I want to see what it says!
[03:52.85]This might provide a safe access to the control room.
[03:54.93]Are you telling... All these people aren't going to see me do this?
[04:00.89]That's kind of suspicious.
[04:03.31]Holy... Yikes.
[04:09.46]Let's go past the window for one second here.
[04:14.54]Get in.
[04:19.53]Ladder right there.
[04:20.37]Let's make it out.
[04:26.56]Climb the ladder.
[04:27.18]Another checkpoint.
[04:31.22]Perfect.
[04:31.46]Checkpoint.
[04:31.98]Gotta activate this train.
[04:33.56]Let's do it.
[04:34.02]He's busy.
[04:54.74]Objective complete.
[04:57.92]Go to Platform B and wait for the next train.
[05:01.38]Let's do it then.
[05:04.28]Ooh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[05:05.54]There's a dude right here.
[05:09.02]Is he going to come in this room?
[05:11.23]Wow.
[05:12.47]No, he's just hanging out over there.
[05:13.49]He should be fine.
[05:16.71]Don't want to go that way.
[05:20.15]Let's head back up the way I came in.
[05:27.96]Keep off tracks.
[05:29.09]Electric current.
[05:29.89]You will die.
[05:33.33]Nobody there.
[05:34.63]Alright, I'm back.
[05:36.01]Hi, people.
[05:38.23]Looks like blending in with the crowd.
[05:40.97]Wait a minute.
[05:41.32]I gotta go over on that side.
[05:45.42]How do I get over there?
[05:50.14]Is there a way to get over there?
[05:51.04]There has to be a way to get over there.
[05:52.12]From over here, maybe?
[05:52.94]I don't know.
[05:54.57]Probably should have stayed up there.
[05:57.51]Let's just check over here first to make sure.
[05:59.43]There's not a way to go over there.
[06:04.74]I'm not seeing any points of interest.
[06:10.22]I wonder if I can just walk by these officers.
[06:16.39]It's going to be risky, but I can try it.
[06:18.37]I got a checkpoint up there in case this goes wrong.
[06:22.23]Let's go for it.
[06:25.80]Hey, how are you, officer?
[06:26.98]Oh, there's another one right here, too.
[06:29.62]Oh, boy.
[06:30.47]This ain't gonna work.
[06:32.73]Oh, this ain't gonna work.
[06:34.03]Oh, this ain't gonna work.
[06:35.41]Wow, it worked!
[06:36.49]Wow!
[06:41.41]More officers here.
[06:42.57]I'm standing in the crowd.
[06:48.30]Ooh.
[06:51.06]One cop there.
[06:51.68]I don't have any instinct left.
[06:52.74]This is gonna be difficult!
[06:57.09]That guy's not paying attention.
[06:58.47]Neither is this guy, so let's keep moving.
[07:03.32]I wonder if I can just play this game and this guy won't do anything.
[07:06.96]Let's see.
[07:09.16]Perfect.
[07:10.08]I'm covered in mud.
[07:15.00]Get out of here, man.
[07:18.57]Alright, turn.
[07:19.41]Let's go.
[07:19.79]Ooh, this guy's coming back this way now.
[07:25.13]This guy's coming back.
[07:25.93]This guy's coming back.
[07:31.04]Made it.
[07:32.46]Beautiful.
[07:33.76]Beautiful.
[07:37.12]Platform B is under close surveillance.
[07:38.78]Timing is crucial.
[07:45.07]Good to know.
[07:45.81]So, where's that train?
[07:49.45]Where is that freakin' train?
[07:53.59]Waitin' for the train.
[07:54.51]Do I have to go down there for the train to come?
[08:01.75]Where's the train?
[08:05.10]Come on, train.
[08:05.76]Let's go.
[08:06.16]Rock out all day.
[08:10.64]I'm going to have to do it.
[08:15.94]Right when these two turn.
[08:21.27]Right when these two guys turn around, I'm going down there.
[08:25.85]This is going to be really hard.
[08:29.71]Holy crap.
[08:32.30]Time to go.
[08:37.74]Time to go, time to go.
[08:39.60]The train will arrive in 60 seconds!
[08:44.79]60 seconds I gotta wait here?
[08:45.85]Oh, this is gonna be so hard!
[08:47.83]This is gonna be so hard!
[08:52.53]Oh man, come on train, let's go!
[08:54.19]45 seconds.
[09:01.18]I'm gonna make this a little bit more difficult.
[09:02.58]I'm gonna get in this crowd right here.
[09:07.64]Come on!
[09:08.08]30 seconds!
[09:08.34]Come on!
[09:12.26]Come on, train!
[09:16.13]Come on, train!
[09:20.35]This is okay.
[09:25.05]This is okay.
[09:27.17]Cops are nowhere to be found.
[09:28.15]I can just chill out.
[09:30.18]Perfect.
[09:33.20]15 seconds.
[09:34.90]Start the countdown.
[09:35.68]Come on.
[09:36.08]Let's go, train.
[09:38.85]Nope.
[09:41.33]Nobody coming.
[09:43.03]Oh, I'm out of here.
[09:43.63]I'm in the clear right now, guys.
[09:44.89]This is it.
[09:48.73]Beautiful.
[09:49.25]Get that train in here.
[09:52.46]Oh, boy.
[09:52.74]He's coming back.
[09:57.06]Oh, crap.
[09:57.72]Come on.
[09:59.30]Before this guy gets over here.
[10:00.18]Let's go.
[10:04.16]Get on the train!
[10:05.08]I, I, what?
[10:06.00]What?
[10:07.06]What?
[10:09.36]Oh.
[10:10.48]Boy.
[10:10.82]Uh, hello, how are you?
[10:13.42]Let me just get in the train.
[10:14.60]I'm just, uh... Just getting in the train!
[10:19.32]Oh no!
[10:22.62]Let me in the train!
[10:24.53]Let me in the train!
[10:25.17]Open the doors!
[10:30.73]I made it in the trade!
[10:31.74]I made it in the trade!
[10:33.96]Yes!
[10:37.80]Alrighty, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:41.32]That was a long mission.
[10:42.73]That took a long time.
[10:43.83]I only had one restart.
[10:48.89]Dual welding expertise, cool.
[10:51.41]Pure instinct, cool.
[10:53.98]Hand-to-hand, cool.
[10:57.07]Okay, let's take a look here.
[10:57.97]Burning Hotel, the library, Xingriya, train station.
[11:02.82]35,000 points.
[11:03.56]This one, this Xingriya one got screwed up.
[11:08.46]Because I had to kill like five people.
[11:09.98]Well, actually one person, but you know, you get the idea.
