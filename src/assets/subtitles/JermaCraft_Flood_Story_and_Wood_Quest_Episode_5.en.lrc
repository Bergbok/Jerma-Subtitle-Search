[00:02.10]Okay.
[00:03.50]So we're out here on the house.
[00:06.41]And I want to make sure... I'm going to try and do this.
[00:09.37]I want to make a little... A little leeway room.
[00:12.91]So when I dig out of my house, I don't flood the basement.
[00:17.65]Because that really does suck.
[00:19.73]It's kind of annoying.
[00:20.65]Because I'll dig out and all of a sudden water will just rush into my basement.
[00:25.98]Actually, is that even technically a basement?
[00:27.94]This is kind of my entire house.
[00:30.56]Oh well.
[00:31.26]Whatever.
[00:32.20]patch you back up.
[00:34.34]So I want to make sure that I can build outwards, rather than have to keep on freaking out every time I build out of my wall.
[00:43.50]And what the hell?
[00:44.40]Okay, yeah, here we go.
[00:46.58]Started to do it a little bit.
[00:47.52]Let's take it more.
[00:49.94]One, two, three.
[00:52.02]See, there's my wall right there.
[00:53.36]So now this will not happen.
[00:56.02]And actually...
[00:58.10]I've got a story for you.
[01:00.86]I didn't even think about this, but I have a story for you right now.
[01:04.76]It's a story hole.
[01:05.38]Let me block off this stupid cascading wave of death.
[01:12.37]Okay, there we go.
[01:12.97]Come on.
[01:14.01]Come on now.
[01:15.79]Perfect.
[01:16.35]Okay, now I can start to build outwards.
[01:20.24]So here's a story for you while I finish this up.
[01:23.06]As a lot of you guys know, it has to do with flooding.
[01:25.36]And it's actually kind of scary.
[01:27.28]Scary time for me and my family.
[01:29.96]Not so scary for you because you are not part of my family.
[01:33.06]Or maybe you are.
[01:35.14]Maybe you are watching this and you are part of my family.
[01:37.98]But where am I going with this?
[01:41.46]So I live in the Northeast.
[01:44.38]And a lot of you guys know that the Northeast is kind of a weird place when it comes to weather.
[01:49.35]We get the craziest, hottest summers.
[01:51.93]We get insanely terrible winters.
[01:54.12]Like, oh, what is it, like 25 inches of snow?
[01:56.56]Oh, that's great!
[01:57.84]We get stuff like that.
[01:58.94]We get heavy rains.
[02:00.10]We get pretty much every season the worst you could possibly get that season.
[02:04.78]So, talking about the rainfall, while I'm just dropping sand into nowhere, talking about the rainfall, while I extend this out...
[02:18.36]Oh, let me try that again.
[02:19.32]Talking about the rainfall while I extend this out.
[02:23.40]Essentially, we had, at one point, it was in April.
[02:27.06]I remember it was April because April was the only thing I remembered because my brain only likes to remember tragic, horrible things and not nice things.
[02:36.26]So it was April, I think, of 2009, I think?
[02:38.07]Maybe 2009.
[02:38.79]No, it was 2009.
[02:39.25]I think.
[02:42.96]Don't quote me on that.
[02:44.77]So April 2009, we had crazy, crazy rainfall.
[02:49.53]We had rain that was... I think we got like 10 inches of rain in like three days or two days or something.
[02:55.61]Like something insane.
[02:58.17]And our foundation of our houses, around here at least in the Northeast, is not really... can't really handle that.
[03:06.50]So my basement, and my basement of my house is living space.
[03:11.52]So my basement of my house got flooded.
[03:14.84]And when I say flooded, I don't mean there was just like, you know, I'm slopping around in like two inches of water.
[03:20.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[03:21.29]Like the entire second level of my house on the bottom was like shin deep in water.
[03:27.87]Almost coming up to like your knees in water.
[03:31.28]And that was one of the worst experiences of my entire life.
[03:34.78]If I can safely tell you that that was...
[03:37.95]That was probably one of the worst things that's ever happened to me and my family.
[03:41.57]It was horrible.
[03:44.15]Every single room that was down here, you were wading through water.
[03:48.38]Just like... Floating cats, dogs.
[03:53.22]We had a bunch of animals here, too.
[03:54.92]We have a ton of animals.
[03:56.46]It just was really, really bad news.
[03:59.25]And it happened twice.
[04:00.79]Twice.
[04:03.48]We had one flood, one big bad one, and we had to do a ton of cleanup.
[04:08.12]We had to get a professional team.
[04:09.80]It was insane.
[04:11.34]We had to throw away thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff.
[04:15.46]And then like two weeks later, it happened again.
[04:19.52]And it was almost like you wanted to frigging blow your brains out.
[04:23.46]You were just like, what is happening to our house?
[04:26.58]It was one of the worst things ever.
[04:28.53]And it happened twice within the same two weeks.
[04:32.27]Oh, even thinking about it makes me want to puke.
[04:35.53]But anyways, let's, while I patch up this little hole here, I want to try and do a, like I was telling you, a castle.
[04:44.07]So I want multiple rooms with a dining table for me to eat with my kingsmanship.
[04:50.48]I'm not sure that even makes any sense, but I want it because I want it.
[04:55.86]Let's make a boat.
[04:57.95]I want to be able to get out of this house fairly easily.
[05:01.59]Here we go.
[05:04.31]Let's go over here.
[05:05.29]I'll look this way.
[05:07.05]Let's put the boat down.
[05:08.97]My personal little boat.
[05:11.95]Okay, how do I get in the boat?
[05:14.79]No, no, no!
[05:15.57]Get back here!
[05:17.05]No, come here!
[05:19.06]Oh, you... How do I get in the boat?
[05:22.02]Do I click on it?
[05:23.36]Oh, I did it.
[05:24.02]Okay, it's right click.
[05:26.36]Dun-dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[05:29.98]Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[05:33.68]We are taking an adventure through the open world.
[05:37.23]Going to go to this tree I forgot to cut down.
[05:40.59]And then I'm going to say hello to this tree.
[05:43.63]Hello tree.
[05:44.37]And then I'm going to get out of the boat.
[05:47.01]Out of the boat.
[05:48.67]How do I get out of the boat?
[05:50.08]How do I get out of the boat?
[05:51.80]Okay.
[05:52.86]Stay.
[05:54.06]Stay.
[05:55.30]If you saw episode one, this is the tree that I didn't cut all the way down.
[06:01.04]And it's the only damn tree with a... What the hell?
[06:05.70]This cow is dead!
[06:07.98]I will dig to you!
[06:13.60]Oh my god!
[06:14.86]I actually killed him, I feel bad.
[06:17.10]Alright.
[06:17.90]Now let's... Let's actually cut this tree down.
[06:22.06]Ooh, delicious!
[06:24.96]This is gross!
[06:27.09]Okay, I should probably stop doing that or I'm gonna die.
[06:31.36]Come here, wood.
[06:31.98]All right.
[06:36.36]The reason I'm doing this is because I want wooden floors.
[06:39.50]I want wooden paneling on the ground.
[06:41.36]Because I got a comment, somebody saying, Jerma, make some wooden floors.
[06:45.72]What are you, a caveman?
[06:47.78]And I responded with, I guess I am a caveman.
[06:51.05]You're right.
[06:51.83]I need to really think about what I'm doing with myself.
[06:55.59]So let's cut down this whole tree.
[06:56.93]Make sure I get the whole damn thing.
[07:00.15]Nothing else, right?
[07:00.97]No, there's just one more.
[07:02.07]Here, I gotta use my torch.
[07:05.12]Okay, that should be it.
[07:06.12]Now, will this tree disappear so I can put a new one here?
[07:09.40]I gotta find new trees.
[07:11.72]This is bad.
[07:13.18]No, there's more.
[07:13.88]What?
[07:14.12]This is, like, embedded into the mountain.
[07:17.71]Is this tree in the mountain?
[07:19.09]Like, embedded in the mountain?
[07:21.61]If I see, like, another wooden plank right here, I'm gonna lose my mind.
[07:26.35]Hold on, I need to check this out.
[07:29.88]Because the tree is still here.
[07:31.90]The tree is still here.
[07:36.92]Okay, this is just odd.
[07:39.96]Look, oh, there we go.
[07:40.76]Found you.
[07:41.81]Found you.
[07:45.03]All right, let's go find some more trees.
[07:48.19]Wow, this is different.
[07:52.79]Hold on, I've got to get a better view.
[07:55.94]There's coal here, too.
[07:56.78]Cool.
[07:58.02]So this is just a giant lava fountain of death?
[08:00.40]Uh, nice!
[08:04.76]Nice!
[08:08.38]Give me a rest of this coal.
[08:10.60]I'll take it.
[08:12.02]I'll take it all!
[08:15.24]I wonder what, so, what does this mean?
[08:18.35]A lot of people freak out and they get excited when they see this, a lava fountain or a big lava thing.
[08:24.68]Somebody tell me in the comments, what does this actually mean?
[08:27.06]Does this mean anything in particular, or is this just really cool looking?
[08:29.76]Don't want to lose my way.
[08:33.05]Because that's happened before.
[08:35.71]I have totally lost my way.
[08:39.79]So I'm going to make sure... I'm leaving a breadcrumb trail of torches to make sure I don't lose my damn place.
[08:50.56]Aren't these things worth something?
[08:52.54]Can't I get a couple pennies for these?
[08:54.00]I'm taking them anyways.
[08:57.24]Don't forget your breadcrumb trail.
[09:01.25]Look at all these cows.
[09:04.77]I could eat this stuff for days.
[09:06.27]Come on.
[09:08.19]Should I have bought a sword?
[09:09.35]Bought a sword?
[09:10.01]You don't buy stuff in this game.
[09:11.52]What am I talking about?
[09:12.44]Uh-oh.
[09:16.12]Come here.
[09:17.88]You've been a bad cow.
[09:19.42]You deserve death.
[09:22.52]Nice.
[09:23.62]There are a lot of cows.
[09:26.58]And none of them really understand that I'm going to kill every single one of them.
[09:31.41]And this guy.
[09:34.29]See, you're just joining them in the party.
[09:35.91]You're just trying to be involved.
[09:37.33]And it's not cool, man.
[09:38.25]We're just trying to hang out here and kill each other as cow friends.
[09:42.80]Alright, I'm hitting you with the... No, I don't want to do that.
[09:46.22]I was told that was a bad idea.
[09:49.69]More of this stuff.
[09:51.31]I think it's wheat.
[09:52.65]Alright, no, don't get off track.
[09:53.97]Don't get off track.
[09:54.73]I've got to find trees.
[09:57.69]No more beating up cows.
[10:00.84]Let's keep going.
[10:03.96]The never-ending trek to find trees.
[10:08.64]And a creeper.
[10:09.68]And two creepers.
[10:11.40]Two creeper bastards.
[10:13.56]And a spider.
[10:16.66]I'm going this way.
[10:18.60]I'm going up to high ground.
[10:19.66]Hey cow, get off of my mountain.
[10:22.82]This is mine.
[10:23.32]Oh, this is going to be funny.
[10:26.25]Oh, he died.
[10:26.85]Oh my god, I kind of feel bad.
[10:29.41]Does that happen to everybody?
[10:30.43]Will he die too?
[10:31.95]Yeah!
[10:34.13]I'm the king of the mountain, baby.
[10:36.67]Sheep, sheep, sheep.
[10:38.19]I need these sheep.
[10:39.15]I need the sheep.
[10:39.75]I need to make a bed.
[10:40.73]I don't care.
[10:42.57]I need the wool.
[10:43.75]Get out of my face.
[10:45.68]Go ahead, blow up.
[10:46.28]Come on, blow up.
[10:47.42]Yeah, that was exactly what I wanted.
[10:49.66]Awesome.
[10:50.70]Thank you, Creeper, for killing all of the other things that were here.
[10:54.68]And leaving me just to collect the delicious sap of life.
[10:59.28]Alright, die.
[11:00.55]Come here, you... There we go, there's two.
[11:02.57]Need one more, and I have a bed.
[11:04.01]And I don't ever have to worry about dying ever again.
[11:06.65]Actually, I kind of do, but still.
[11:08.83]Come here.
[11:11.81]Die.
[11:12.37]Die.
[11:13.36]All right.
[11:14.04]I got the wool I need, but I want some chocolate wool.
[11:16.68]I want some chocolate milk.
[11:18.92]If you punch the... Get out of here.
[11:21.29]Come on.
[11:21.63]I don't got all day.
[11:24.91]I'm using the same strategy as I did before.
[11:27.93]Blow up.
[11:29.87]No, it didn't kill anybody.
[11:32.88]You go in here and drown.
[11:34.72]Leave me alone.
