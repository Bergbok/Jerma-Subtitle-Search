[00:11.99]I'm going for the shotgun.
[00:14.84]Shotgun is where it's at.
[00:16.58]I did not know what Francis was going to say.
[00:18.28]He was like, man, Zoe is pissed.
[00:20.00]I thought he was going to say, man, Zoe is hot.
[00:24.04]Quite the opposite.
[00:25.80]All right, let's do this thing.
[00:28.96]Gary, careful.
[00:29.72]They can spawn now.
[00:31.90]Yeah, they're usually on that roof up there.
[00:33.46]Yeah, they are.
[00:34.08]There's a smoker up there.
[00:37.27]You got one.
[00:37.73]There you go.
[00:39.13]Oh, Rigatoni.
[00:40.90]Oh, Rigatoni.
[00:41.88]Rigatoni.
[00:43.70]Oh, there's a Hunter.
[00:44.30]Hunter coming down right now.
[00:45.10]Hunter on the move.
[00:47.10]Thank you very much.
[00:47.72]And a Smoker.
[00:49.82]On Rigatoni.
[00:51.64]Oh, Hunter on me.
[00:52.16]Hunter on me.
[00:52.54]All right.
[00:53.12]Let's go.
[00:53.68]Let's go.
[00:54.22]They're all down.
[00:54.86]Oh, I'm so sorry, Gemma.
[00:56.90]Oh, God.
[00:57.32]It's all right.
[00:57.76]They're all down.
[00:58.46]We have 20 seconds just to move.
[00:59.74]Just move.
[01:01.10]Okey-dokey.
[01:01.84]Reload, damn it.
[01:04.31]They got a respawn time.
[01:05.13]Oh, they have a spitter behind us.
[01:06.56]Or in front of us, I'm not sure.
[01:07.56]How?
[01:09.14]How is that possible?
[01:10.64]I have no idea.
[01:13.55]Do they have, like, a set respawn delay?
[01:14.91]Or is it on, like, um... It's like 20 seconds.
[01:16.89]Yeah, it's like 20 seconds, I think.
[01:18.09]Okay.
[01:18.75]That's a nasty time delay.
[01:21.21]Let's move on out of here.
[01:22.23]I think it's like, if they have a full team, then it takes longer, but if there's only like two on their team, it's only like a ten second delay, so they can get more, more infected.
[01:29.47]Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap.
[01:30.15]Where's the, where's the spitter up top?
[01:31.23]I don't know.
[01:32.09]Yeah, I don't know.
[01:32.50]Spitter on the roof.
[01:34.08]Spitter on the roof.
[01:34.72]We can jump over the dump boat.
[01:35.44]Fiddler on the roof.
[01:36.00]Yep.
[01:38.66]Alright, so far, so far so good.
[01:42.32]So far so good.

[02:18.47]Oh god!
[02:19.71]Thank you.
[02:20.29]Alright, we gotta keep moving, keep moving.
[02:22.19]I definitely don't overreact.
[02:27.16]Hey, overreacting is okay, Left 4 Dead, because it's scary.
[02:31.46]Oh, is that a spitter back in here?
[02:33.48]There's a hunter right there, coming up to try and get a... He's not dead, the hunter's still back there.
[02:41.79]He is still back there.
[02:45.48]Keep your eye out for boomers.
[02:46.32]There hasn't been a boomer in a while, so keep your eye out.
[02:50.90]You know what?
[02:51.18]I'm going to throw this behind us.
[02:53.70]Spy around here.
[02:56.05]Did he just say spy around here?
[02:57.61]Oh my god, I'm busy trying to blight a fire and I can't even... Oh, what an idiot.
[03:04.33]I was literally just thinking about... I hear a hunter.
[03:06.34]I can't see anything.
[03:07.14]Oh my god, that was a good charge.
[03:09.00]Oh man, all at once.
[03:11.41]Are we dead right now?
[03:12.71]I'm coming, Jerma!
[03:14.35]Save me!
[03:15.51]Kill that Charger!
[03:16.33]Alright, we're good.
[03:23.92]We're alright.
[03:24.44]There's a real shame about my aim.
[03:25.96]Oh, this son of a bitch is still stomping me.
[03:28.08]Thanks, bro.
[03:31.64]It's no problem.
[03:33.22]Perga's killed Jerma.
[03:35.10]We're good, we're good.
[03:38.39]I need a... Boo, let me get those pills.
[03:40.53]Sure thing, honey.
[03:42.75]Oh, come back to me.
[03:44.29]Oh, what?
[03:45.01]What?
[03:46.69]Come on, Regattoni.
[03:47.57]There's a jockey over here, too.
[03:50.54]Jockey, help me.
[03:51.24]Jockey, help me.
[03:52.68]Our teammate's killing the shit out of me.
[03:57.72]Sweet shot.
[03:59.40]We got to get out of this area.
[04:01.52]Oh, my God.
[04:02.41]There's a charging.
[04:06.15]Oh, no, it's not charging.
[04:07.99]Just a very fat common infected.
[04:14.36]Let's do this thing.
[04:15.42]We gotta get out of this area.
[04:16.63]Like, right when I get up, run.
[04:18.69]Just start running the other way.
[04:20.81]Just right-click on me with those pills.
[04:23.71]That's what I'm talking about.
[04:24.49]Let's get the hell out of here.
[04:26.43]Is it through here?
[04:27.47]Pills.
[04:28.69]Oh, no.
[04:29.03]Okay, let's go.
[04:31.39]Let's get out of here.

[04:33.01]Spitter right here.
[04:35.55]Dead.
[04:38.19]Um, I'm all confused.
[04:39.85]Rigatoni's behind us.
[04:41.41]I don't think he's playing, to be honest.
[04:42.77]Oh god.
[04:43.45]Is he just like, AFK?
[04:45.13]We'll leave, what, oh, uh, no, we can't leave him.
[04:50.64]Alright, if you revive him and he stands still, we're just gonna run.
[04:55.28]Oh, no!
[04:56.32]No!
[04:57.68]Save me!
[04:59.52]He's still alive up there.
[05:00.22]Yeah, he's standing still.
[05:01.04]God damn it.
[05:01.42]Just go, just go, leave him, leave him.
[05:04.34]Goodbye, Rigatoni.
