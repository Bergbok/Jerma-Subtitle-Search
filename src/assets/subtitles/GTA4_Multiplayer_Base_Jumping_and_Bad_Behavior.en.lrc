[03:44.06]Oh my god.
[03:45.86]What?
[03:46.24]What is going on?
[03:47.70]All the cops that were coming after you are like, oh my god, get me away.
[03:51.68]It's like an enemy helicopter.
[03:53.74]Oh my god, dude.
[03:56.22]Oh my god.
[03:59.01]Are you serious?
[04:02.23]Why are there so many?
[04:04.95]Why are there so...
[04:07.27]Why are they killing you?
[04:12.01]Every cop in the city just came after me.
[04:15.02]Like, they just were all pulling up at the same time.
[04:19.14]Why are there so many?
[04:23.60]Why are there so many?
[04:27.46]Why are they killing you?
[04:29.00]Let's try this again.
[04:30.68]We're going to the other side.
[04:32.16]We're going to go this way.
[04:33.16]It's a little bit more of a longer drive.
[04:35.39]I'm going to go off the edge.
[04:38.59]The cops are coming.
[04:39.85]Wait there.
[04:40.35]The cops are coming.
[04:43.05]Oh, shit.
[04:47.17]What are you doing?
[04:50.95]What are you doing?
[04:57.76]We're trying to do insane stunts.
[05:02.06]Hello.
[05:05.15]What?
[05:05.41]How did you get... Just get on the bike.
[05:10.83]There's another one here.
[05:11.95]How you doing?
[05:14.21]Oh, I'm so tempted to shoot this guy.
[05:16.07]No, don't do it.
[05:18.49]Don't do it.
[05:18.91]We're going to see if we get the cops on us for doing this.
[05:21.73]He's like...
[05:27.92]No, not yet, not yet, hold on.
[05:34.12]Oh, jeez.
[05:37.44]I can't believe we don't have any stars.
[05:41.02]He doesn't even get pissed if I point my gun at him.
[05:43.20]It's the worst cop ever.
[05:51.80]You are legitimately pointing your gun at his face.
[06:01.73]Sorry, officer.
[06:06.14]Why did you cut his face?
[06:11.68]Sorry, officer.
[06:30.38]Oh, there's one more over there.
[06:31.22]Let me just... I don't want to repeat it last time, so I'm just going to go off the ground before I shoot.
[06:35.42]Okay, that should do it.
[06:37.00]There we go.
[06:39.82]Oh, no, he's still alive.
[06:40.64]What a beast.
[06:41.85]There we go.
[06:45.61]Stealthman, you were, like, pointing your gun at me.
[06:47.71]I'm, like, holding it, like, upside down like this.
[06:50.99]Your back was, like, breaking to do it.
[06:53.43]Like, oh, my God.
[06:55.01]I'm laughing at that.
[06:58.50]Don't!
[06:58.82]Don't go over the edge.
[07:00.12]Alright, okay.
[07:00.86]We're okay.
[07:02.42]Extreme stunts!
[07:04.52]Okay.
[07:04.86]Alright, when you see us getting close, Boo, do it.
[07:08.42]Do it.
[07:10.56]Oh, damn it!
[07:14.08]What just happened?
[07:15.02]That's why we have to turn friendly fire off, so it doesn't kill us.
[07:21.85]Oh my god.
[07:22.87]Okay, well.
