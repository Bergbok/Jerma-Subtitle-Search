[00:09.30]Where am I supposed to bring this guy?
[00:12.02]This is a gigantic base with people in it.
[00:13.71]How am I supposed to sneak him out?
[00:15.45]Leave the base with the captive.
[00:18.15]Oh, the body can be hidden in a truck.
[00:20.49]And that makes sense.
[00:22.39]Okay, well you stay put.
[00:23.71]I'll be back.
[00:25.85]I killed him.
[00:29.31]I've been sitting here for at least a few minutes.
[00:31.59]Trying to figure out what exactly this fucking guy is doing.
[00:36.28]Is he wiping down this old rusty cabinet with his hands?
[00:42.41]Or is he looking for a stud?
[00:44.27]What are you doing?
[00:47.23]Stop.
[00:47.75]Stop it, please.
[00:50.48]I had to do that.
[00:51.12]You had... Who was that?
[00:59.60]Oh, he found me.
[01:01.53]He found me.
[01:03.79]He is trying to figure out how to shoot me right now.
[01:08.33]Oh shit!
[01:09.41]Did you guys see that?
[01:10.53]That fucking hat over there!
[01:12.67]I can't seem to hit it!
[01:14.19]How do I hit this fucking hat that's on the ground?
[01:20.66]You guys are so stupid.
[01:22.22]You can't hit a fucking hat on the ground.
[01:25.54]Is that what you're saying?
[01:37.11]Who is flying by and dropping missiles on this place?
[01:44.93]Stop with the fucking bombs.
[01:49.07]I'm being hidden by this guy.
[01:52.74]Are you kidding me?
[01:54.36]Are you guys kidding me right now?
[01:58.94]These people are all out of their minds.
[02:01.28]They keep coming in here, realizing where I am, and then somebody throws a grenade into the room and they have to leave.
[02:09.57]And some of them actually die.
[02:14.95]There he is, I found him!
[02:16.55]Oh, wait, Jerry, did you just throw a grenade into the room?
[02:22.48]Which one of you morons is gonna throw the grenade?
[02:26.50]That's the question.
[02:28.62]We got the whole troop in here.
[02:32.44]Who's gonna be the trigger finger moron?
[02:35.50]That does it.
[02:38.56]What's the holdup?
[02:39.48]I don't understand what the holdup is.
[02:49.53]Was it you?
[02:51.05]Was it you?
[02:54.19]Was it you?
[03:04.37]What's going on?
[03:08.89]This guy.
[03:13.13]He's pointing his gun over.
[03:15.29]And you're like, what happened over here?
[03:17.47]I heard an explosion of some sort.
[03:22.30]Throw it.
[03:23.80]Throw the grenade.
[03:24.48]Here we go.
[03:25.24]It's my chance.
[03:30.42]Throw it.
[03:33.38]Alright, get up.
[03:34.50]Did you just throw one in here?
[03:40.16]Why would you walk in the room after you threw it?
[03:42.98]You threw it into the wall!
[03:45.38]I can't stop playing in the grenade room.
[03:48.06]I've just been reloading this over and over again.
[04:00.35]Something interesting.
[04:01.75]If you take a look at the mini-map, you see all the green blobs.
[04:04.67]Those are all the people, all the guards, all the hotel staff, all the people here cannot see through my disguise.
[04:11.58]There's one red blip.
[04:13.40]Do you want to know who it is?
[04:16.38]The chef.
[04:19.06]There are other chefs in here that can't see through.
[04:21.61]I'm just going to throw a fucking plate in this guy's face.
[04:33.02]What just hurt me?
[04:33.46]Did this guy grab my leg?
[04:36.66]What is going on?
[04:37.30]What is hurting me?
[04:37.98]What the fuck just killed me?
[04:44.50]Did I freeze in the freezer?
[04:47.02]Oh, don't tell me you can freeze in the freezer.
[04:49.40]Do not give me that kind of power.
[04:50.68]Hey, Gary, just the man I wanted to see.
[04:54.96]Hey, look, can you go ahead and grab me some extra kebabs from the freezer?
[04:57.96]What a fucking idiot.
[04:59.52]What an idiot.
[05:02.90]Now do me a favor, Gary.
[05:04.88]Fucking freeze.
[05:08.73]He's not freezing.
[05:11.53]Is this guy immune to cold?
[05:14.97]Why do I freeze in here, but he doesn't?
[05:18.06]That's bullshit.
[05:20.20]Gary!
[05:23.42]Put the guy in the chair.
[05:26.68]He won't even suspect a goddamn thing.
[05:32.63]I wasn't supposed to kill that guy.
[05:38.83]God damn it.
[05:42.01]That's easy.
[05:44.81]Hey, I'm not doing anything in here.
[05:48.15]Are you seriously wondering how that guy died?
[05:51.06]You opened the door and I didn't.
[05:52.42]Don't fuck with Jeff!
[05:55.76]0800 hours.
[05:59.88]My mission is to find the mole.
[06:02.61]I gotta be quick.
[06:03.93]I've gotta be silent.
[06:05.49]And unseen.
[06:07.71]I find my target.
[06:09.13]He's this guy.
[06:10.45]I throw a piece of china right in his mouth.
[06:14.11]Mission accomplished.
[06:15.87]I can now escape undetected.
[06:21.01]You know, I really wish they would play something else.
[06:23.67]You're right, Jerry.
[06:24.93]And I agree.
[06:26.39]I think this piano player really needs to shut the fuck up.
[06:29.51]Get some rock music in here.
[06:31.10]You know what I'm saying?
[06:44.00]I'm just being annoying right now.
[06:45.42]That's all I'm doing.
[06:47.86]Just ruining these people's dinner.
[06:54.23]How am I gonna go about... Excuse me.
[06:57.79]Excuse me.
[06:59.71]Are you serious?
[07:00.55]Occupied, get out of here!
[07:02.48]What are you doing?
[07:03.46]Get away from me!
[07:08.72]Oh, good afternoon!
[07:10.30]Yeah, there's somebody in this one.
[07:13.15]Yeah, no, somebody's still in it, thank you for understanding.
[07:16.09]Second time.
[07:17.91]Third time?
[07:19.51]He doesn't- he's gonna piss in my face.
