[00:10.29]This is so dumb.
[00:11.39]This is the dumbest thing ever, I love it.
[00:13.45]Alright, are we ready to play Red Light, Green Light?
[00:18.95]Yes, yes, yes, yes, stop.
[00:20.97]So, turn around.
[00:22.71]Come over here.
[00:24.47]And, Green Light.
[00:26.23]Red Light!
[00:29.47]No!
[00:29.75]You're not supposed to taunt kill!
[00:38.42]So both of you guys stand there.
[00:41.96]Make sure your sentry does not fire.
[00:43.51]Make sure... Be careful you don't fall off.
[00:51.83]Like that guy just did.
[00:54.20]Oh, man.
[00:56.30]It's going to be very difficult to upgrade them because they're just going to stop firing.
[00:59.94]So...
[01:02.37]If you can get it, if you're confident you can get it built to level 3, then try.
[01:08.69]But try not to kill anybody.
[01:10.57]Oh, dear.
[01:11.81]Oh, dear.
[01:12.60]It's chaos.
[01:13.78]It's chaos.
[01:14.50]Somebody died.
[01:16.90]Abandon mission.
[01:17.94]Abort mission.
[01:31.86]What's happening?
[01:35.27]Dude, this is insanity.
[01:36.63]Well, okay.
[01:37.65]So, I think we found a problem.
[01:40.43]If one person dies, then it all goes to hell.
[01:47.76]Everybody point your laser beam.
[01:50.46]Let's go with the guy in the green hat first, because he's standing up there.
[01:53.30]Everybody point your la- The friendly fire is on.
[01:56.72]Everybody point your laser at him.
[01:59.18]I want you to uber him, and then everybody unload on this guy, alright?
[02:04.78]So, are we all ready?
[02:09.98]Yeah, on the count of three, uber him, and then once he's ubered, everybody just start just annihilating him.
[02:15.67]Ready?
[02:17.63]Three, two, one, uber!
[02:21.19]Get him!
[02:25.72]He's getting pushed back.
[02:30.80]Is he still alive?
[02:31.80]Alright, hold your fire.
[02:35.15]Hold your fire.
[02:35.95]Hold your fire.
[02:38.09]Hold your fire.
[02:38.93]Oh no.
[02:42.21]Here comes the cottage.
[02:44.88]Here comes the cottage.
[02:51.14]This server's gonna break.
[02:56.12]Alright, so what we have created here... It looks almost like... It's like a caterpillar.
[03:02.59]We've made an NG caterpillar.
[03:07.69]This is actually, like, very... This is, like, very pretty.
[03:10.31]No!
[03:10.79]No!
[03:11.27]No!
[03:11.77]No!
[03:12.25]No!
[03:13.15]No!
[03:14.33]No!
[03:17.54]Bang.
[03:17.90]Right there.
[03:19.72]Make sure you got that Wrangler on.
[03:21.12]Jump.
[03:21.40]Everybody get on top.
[03:22.74]Let's hope it works this time.
[03:25.32]Our beautiful centipede.
[03:27.24]Our wonderfully beautiful engineer centipede that we've made.
[03:29.84]And I want... Everybody just move your... Do a laser light show.
[03:33.96]I want to see what it looks like.
[03:34.74]Just spin around everywhere.
[03:36.02]Everybody spread out a lot.
[03:38.66]That's good, that's good.
[03:39.44]Everyone spread out a lot, and then everyone aim at the air.
[03:55.21]And at the same time, count to three, everybody right click.
[03:58.71]And let's just see what happens.
[03:59.59]Ready?
[04:00.67]Three, two, one, click.
[04:02.99]Alright, let's see what happens.
[04:05.91]Oh, God.
[04:06.61]Only one person.
[04:11.28]This guy right here is the only guy that got hit by one.
[04:14.82]And look at how long he stunk.
[04:18.16]Wow, I did not expect that.
[04:21.68]And three, two, one, go.
[04:25.89]Yay, it's like fireworks.
[04:30.29]One fi- Was it the same guy?
[04:34.38]Blue Pyro?
[04:35.88]You should probably get over to the blue Pyro side.
[04:38.16]This is the red territory.
[04:40.52]This is red territory.
[04:42.66]Alright, get out.
[04:45.86]Blue Pyro's go- Blue Pyro's go on the blue side.
[04:48.68]Red Pyro's on red side.
[04:50.48]This is not gonna work.
[04:52.78]This is not gonna work at all.
[04:54.14]Oh my god.
[04:55.46]Holy shit.
[04:58.54]You are the scariest person I've ever seen in my life.
[05:03.92]That is outrageous.
[05:07.07]Okay, you're just... I have nightmares.
[05:09.23]I'm gonna have nightmares tonight because of that face.
[05:13.03]Alright, you guys ready?
[05:14.13]Only air blast.
[05:15.09]Only air blast.
[05:17.05]And whoever wins, wins.
[05:19.99]This one blue pyro, get out of here, man.
[05:21.88]You gotta get on the blue side.
[05:23.86]Ready?
[05:25.86]Here we go, in three, two, one.
[05:31.58]Charge!
[05:35.34]No, no, who used fire?
[05:37.44]Somebody used flames.
