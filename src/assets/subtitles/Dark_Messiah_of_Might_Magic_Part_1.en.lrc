[01:05.66]Hello.
[01:07.26]Hi, everybody.
[01:11.70]Late again.
[01:13.66]Well, I had to use the bathroom, okay?
[01:15.18]I had to use the toilet.
[01:17.87]Sometimes you use the toilet before you stream a live stream.
[01:22.63]Give me a little bit of credit.
[01:25.83]How you guys doing?
[01:26.67]Welcome back.
[01:28.79]After the stream that was last night.
[01:33.60]Loud pee.
[01:34.26]I didn't even pee.
[01:36.18]And I didn't do a number two either.
[01:39.72]I did the ever so slightly out of reach number four.
[01:44.27]If you don't know what number four is, look it up.
[01:49.95]Actually, I don't know what number four is.
[01:51.57]So it might be something horrible.
[01:52.78]Don't look it up.
[01:55.70]Not puke.
[01:56.08]Puke is three.
[02:02.12]No, four is... No, that's not what I was saying.
[02:05.96]Hold on a second.
[02:06.64]Let me just shake out my coffee because we're going to drink coffee tonight.
[02:14.38]Number four is puking.
[02:15.58]So what is three?
[02:19.14]One is pee.
[02:19.92]Two is poo.
[02:21.32]Three is puke.
[02:22.94]Four is crying.
[02:25.14]Five is nothing else.
[02:28.69]Nothing else that I can't say on stream.
[02:31.03]Six is all of them combined at the same time.
[02:35.09]All of them.
[02:36.97]All of them.
[02:37.89]All functions coming out at the same time.
[02:43.82]I was crying.
[02:47.10]I was crying with joy, you know?
[02:49.32]Sometimes I saw this, I saw a picture of a baby.
[02:51.66]Somebody sent me a picture of a baby and I was just like, that's so beautiful.
[02:58.27]Birth, one of them, no, God.
[03:02.30]Tonight we're gonna play Messiah.
[03:04.26]Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.
[03:06.02]Whatever the name of this fucking game is.
[03:07.62]It looks great.
[03:08.98]I've been told by a lot of people to play it.
[03:11.60]And I just haven't done it.
[03:13.62]This is one of those games that's been around for a long time that I've always thought of.
[03:16.99]Hey, that looks like fun.
[03:18.93]I've had people, friends, viewers, play this game, play this game, play this game.
[03:23.11]And finally, we're gonna do it.
[03:25.45]So, I've never played it.
[03:26.83]Going in completely blind.
[03:27.69]I have no idea what to expect.
[03:28.91]All I know is that it can get like crazy.
[03:31.37]That's all I know.
[03:35.32]Hey, thank you Gummy Monk for the $15.
[03:38.60]Psyched for this.
[03:39.23]Love the game.
[03:39.71]You gotta get the shrinking spell.
[03:41.03]It'll be great.
[03:42.69]Well, I wanted to play a sorcerer, so like... I don't know.
[03:45.55]We'll see.
[03:46.91]But thank you for the $15, Gummy Monk.
[03:48.61]Always appreciate it.
[03:49.31]JK Laser, thanks for the $5.
[03:50.45]Called Jerma.
[03:51.79]He's crying in the bathroom.
[03:52.69]Star called Jerma.
[03:53.53]He's crying in the bathroom.
[03:54.60]I think, like, Star is, like, screaming right now.
[03:57.04]I'm not gonna do that.
[04:00.78]Flex.
[04:02.48]You don't get to see my arms.
[04:06.87]There's only two people that can see my arms.
[04:09.65]There's only four people that can see my arms.
[04:12.29]Me, Kim, my mother, because of fucking medical concerns.
[04:16.35]If I'm like, hey ma, there's like a fucking ward on me.
[04:18.07]She can look at it.
[04:18.79]Mom, dad, to prove myself.
[04:21.59]Like, look at me, dad.
[04:22.29]You know what I mean?
[04:22.83]Check these arms out, dad.
[04:25.11]the four and a doctor so five people and Like if I'm going to the gym like I like and I'm like doing like fucking push-ups and shit six So when you combine all of them, and that's what I did in the bathroom this afternoon.
[04:37.60]Let's play might imagine Take off the intro we don't need that anymore do we bring this around oh?
[04:55.01]And there it is.
[04:55.53]Okay.
[04:56.99]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[04:57.83]I'm going to drop it a lot just in case it is.
[05:00.45]It could be.
[05:03.64]Come on.
[05:04.26]Any second now.
[05:06.88]I think it crashed.
[05:08.38]Oh, it crashed.
[05:09.08]Oh, of course it did.
[05:11.56]Of course it did.
[05:13.92]Nothing works.
[05:15.31]We have to like try to start a game like four times before it actually functions on these streams.
[05:19.85]Don't you guys know?
[05:21.87]Thank you, Smokewise Ganja, for the bits.
[05:24.53]$5.
[05:24.61]Please kick everything you see.
[05:25.81]Thank you.
[05:28.35]I will try.
[05:28.81]I will try to kick.
[05:31.66]Kicking sounds like fun.
[05:35.30]Those of you that are asking me to kick, I promise I will kick someone.
[05:40.44]Alright, let's try it again.
[05:41.68]Cover your ears.
[05:42.32]This intro splashes loud as hell.
[05:44.50]Actually, I can just mute it.
[05:46.06]I'll just save you guys the headache.
[05:48.82]How does that sound?
[05:52.15]Hey, look at that.
[05:53.03]And there it is.
[05:59.37]Ubisoft made this game.
[06:00.51]You know it's gonna be a good one.
[06:01.91]Let's just skip this.
[06:06.06]Skip that.
[06:07.74]Okay, now you can hear the game.
[06:11.56]Or can you?
[06:14.18]Oh shit, it's like broken.
[06:18.61]Why?
[06:20.33]Every time.
[06:20.97]I swear to God.
[06:22.43]Like, I tried.
[06:23.19]I fucking tested this before I started streaming, right?
[06:26.79]Like, God fucking sees me turn a stream on.
[06:30.22]And legitimately, he's like, nope, not today.
[06:33.10]And he fucking just puts his hands around my neck.
[06:38.84]I don't understand it.
[06:40.32]I don't get it, guys.
[06:44.40]I gotta, like, fucking force quit out of this now.
[06:48.36]Let's try it again.
[06:51.14]Let's try playing a video game that I purchased and try to screen grab it.
[06:56.85]Fucking dumbass technology.
[06:58.31]It's gonna be loud!
[06:59.69]It's gonna be loud.
[07:03.75]Oh my god, it crashed again.
[07:05.43]Oh my fucking god.
[07:06.49]I got a memory problem.
[07:10.33]Turn my stream on, it gets a memory problem.
[07:14.06]I'm so sick of this shit.
[07:16.10]I'm so sick of this shit happening.
[07:18.34]I can't even fucking... Open the fucking game.
[07:26.22]Now.
[07:27.03]I command it.
[07:27.85]Holy shit.
[07:31.69]Give me a fucking break.
[07:33.57]I ain't touching anything.
[07:34.55]I can't even see notifications now.
[07:38.83]Jesus fucking criminy.
[07:42.20]Well, here it is.
[07:42.98]Here's the dark messiah of might and magic.
[07:48.64]You gotta be stern with video games.
[07:50.20]You gotta yell at them sometimes.
[07:52.99]I did command it.
[07:59.47]This is a Source Engine game.
[08:01.81]I can run this borderless window, can't I?
[08:03.55]Maybe I can't.
[08:06.47]I'm terrified to try anything.
[08:10.67]I'm like absolutely terrified to try to do anything after this broke.
[08:13.45]But anyways, let's get started.
[08:16.31]There's probably going to be a cutscene.
[08:17.52]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[08:18.40]If it is, I can't turn it down yet.
[08:19.82]So we'll see.
[08:20.82]New game.
[08:22.64]Normal.
[08:22.92]We're not playing it hard or hardcore.
[08:24.45]We're going to be normal losers.
[08:28.28]Master Fenrir.
[08:30.88]Where are you?
[08:31.90]I'm here, sir.
[08:32.86]Okay.
[08:33.80]Now listen.
[08:35.18]In the room ahead, there's an altar with a spider artifact.
[08:40.20]Take it.
[08:41.26]We'll need it to get to the shanty.
[08:43.22]I gotta go get the spider.
[08:44.14]Okay.
[08:47.37]Oh, wow.
[08:47.75]We got a lot of... And have no fear.
[08:52.23]I'll be watching over you.
[08:53.85]This guy sounds like somebody.
[08:56.03]Who does he sound like?
[08:56.99]I don't know.
[08:59.71]Hold on a second.
[09:00.65]Let me just get this situated.
[09:05.37]Oh, shit.
[09:06.05]Okay.
[09:07.27]Press O to hide your objectives.
[09:08.31]Let's change the... This is way, way too high.
[09:12.73]Like, holy shit.
[09:15.68]Press O to hide your objectives.
[09:17.64]Okay.
[09:18.26]Find the Shantiri crystal.
[09:19.90]Obtain a spider key.
[09:22.38]What do we got for an FOV right now?
[09:24.06]Where's the FOV?
[09:24.86]Let's take a look.
[09:27.30]I guess... I don't know.
[09:30.51]It looks alright.
[09:31.49]Doesn't look terrible.
[09:37.25]Is this a scary game?
[09:42.67]It might be a scary game.
[09:44.61]Well, there's my light.
[09:45.93]I guess I can do that.
[09:49.73]There's a sprint.
[09:50.45]Okay.
[09:50.81]Can I open any doors?
[09:56.17]I guess I'm going in here.
[09:57.03]Press E to take the spider key.
[09:59.23]Got it.
[10:01.77]You think I'm going to get jump scared?
[10:03.07]I might.
[10:03.61]It might happen.
[10:07.17]Who does this guy sound like?
[10:08.19]It views the spider key.
[10:11.10]It sounds like somebody.
[10:12.80]Mm-hmm.
[10:19.54]Alright.
[10:20.34]Open the door.
[10:23.12]It does sound like George Takei.
[10:27.21]That sounds exactly like George Takei, you're right.
[10:28.99]Alright, hurry through the fog gate.
[10:33.91]Made it.
[10:34.73]Easy.
[10:35.11]Tutorial ain't even fucking a big deal.
[10:38.40]Tutorial ain't even a big deal.
[10:40.04]We got, like, lots of big deals.
[10:44.72]You can sprint until your stamina bar is empty, then you must stop for a while to recover.
[10:47.18]Yeah.
[10:47.28]They can be kicked.
[10:52.57]This is what everybody, this is the LOL thing that everybody wanted me to do, right?
[10:56.77]Okay, that is pretty funny.
[10:57.85]You'll have to go up here.
[10:59.99]Jump on that chain and climb.
[11:01.95]Chain?
[11:02.45]God, okay.
[11:06.41]I can't even see.
[11:07.29]Is there like a brightness in this game?
[11:08.65]This is not bright at all.
[11:09.87]This is too, this is not bright.
[11:11.69]It's too unbright.
[11:13.15]I need more illumination.
[11:14.01]Okay, hold down buttons.
[11:17.05]Okay, that's how you climb.
[11:18.23]We got it.
[11:20.47]Table match memories.
[11:21.49]Stop talking about Cheez-Its and fucking Cheez-Nuts.
[11:24.82]Approach the crates and press E to take them.
[11:27.24]Okay.
[11:31.36]You can hold crates.
[11:34.40]Press mouse 1 to throw.
[11:37.16]Okay, that's fucking amazing.
[11:39.38]Move the crates to clear the way.
[11:40.72]You tell me I can just double-handed throw as hard as I can shit into somebody's face?
[11:46.97]Oh, this ain't gonna be fucking hilarious.
[11:49.57]Cheez-Its suck.
[11:51.19]Stop talking about Cheez-Its and Cheez-Nips.
[11:57.26]Okay, fine.
[11:58.40]Okay, fine.
[11:59.58]You want to keep talking about fucking Cheez-Its?
[12:01.86]Why don't we have a live taste test?
[12:03.36]How does that sound, huh?
[12:04.78]You want to have a live fucking taste test?
[12:06.62]You want to come on my stream and talk about Cheez-Its versus Cheez-Nips?
[12:09.76]That's fine.
[12:10.18]Why don't we have a live taste test?
[12:15.40]Un-fucking-believable.
[12:17.99]On the left, on your, on my left, we have Cheesnips.
[12:23.34]Clearly labeled.
[12:25.24]Clearly in view, right?
[12:27.42]Over here, we have Cheez-Its.
[12:29.82]My personal favorite.
[12:30.86]These are my personal favorite.
[12:33.34]And I have a feeling I know which one is going to win.
[12:36.60]So, but, you know, just in case, just in case anything goes wrong, I wanted to be prepared.
[12:42.57]Got ourselves a little bit of an antidote there.
[12:44.55]Because these are poisonous.
[12:46.89]So, I...
[12:48.35]I'm just, I'm not looking forward to it at all, but I have it just erring on the side of caution.
[12:53.62]So here's what we're gonna do.
[12:54.38]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna simply close my eyes.
[12:56.32]Like, I'm not, you guys can take a look.
[12:58.18]I'm not gonna be able to see this.
[12:59.54]We're gonna rip, this is cheese nips, right?
[13:02.66]Simply just gonna, I'm gonna bury my fucking eyes closed like this.
[13:05.10]We're gonna move them around like this.
[13:16.14]Took a look.
[13:16.78]I'm not squinting.
[13:18.00]No blindfolds here.
[13:19.28]I'm here alone.
[13:20.06]I can't do this by myself.
[13:23.02]I literally have no idea.
[13:24.12]I have absolutely no idea at this point.
[13:25.50]Not a clue.
[13:27.42]No fucking idea.
[13:28.10]I have no idea.
[13:28.78]I don't know what this one is.
[13:29.79]I have no idea.
[13:30.55]We're gonna test it out.
[13:31.15]We're gonna see.
[13:32.57]Funts and fucking for all, what the best cheese-flavored cracker actually is.
[13:36.41]Here we go.
[13:36.81]Taste test.
[13:37.29]Mm.
[13:46.75]I'm getting some oak flavoring.
[13:49.97]Smells like trash.
[13:53.27]Tastes like trash too, actually.
[13:58.05]I'm getting a very distinct, a very distinct poison flavor.
[14:02.47]Very fucking disgusting.
[14:03.66]Tastes like somebody burnt rubber and then shit on it and put it in my mouth.
[14:08.10]I gotta do the next one real quick.
[14:10.22]Whatever this one is.
[14:13.96]Gotta go, gotta go.
[14:14.50]What is this?
[14:14.80]Okay, here we go.
[14:19.17]Ooh, that's the flavor I recognize.
[14:24.77]A slight hint of raspberry.
[14:28.27]Mm-hmm.
[14:31.43]That's what I'm talking about.
[14:32.83]It's been aged in 12 oak barrels.
[14:37.84]I fucking, I got it.
[14:39.72]I knew it!
[15:21.95]Eat all the cheese nibs or it's fake.
[15:27.51]Also, by the way, it's fucking delicious.
[15:37.86]What's wrong with you, bro?
[15:39.22]I don't know.
[15:39.66]Lots of things.
[15:41.32]Hey, remember that game Might and Magic?
[15:42.68]Let me move this shit out of the way.
[15:52.11]Fuck.
[15:55.91]By the way... Cheese Nips was supposed to win.
[16:08.55]That joke went south real quick.
[16:11.07]I actually thought the Cheez-Its were Cheez-Nips.
[16:14.35]And I thought the Cheez-Nips were Cheez-Its.
[16:17.31]Cheez-Nips was supposed to win.
[16:23.72]Well, I fucked that one up.
[16:30.73]I actually really thought they were different.
[16:33.41]I played myself.
[16:36.74]So actually, in reality, in actual reality, and actually, I thought these were Cheez-Its.
[16:46.35]And I thought these were cheese nips.
[16:48.09]So in fucking reality, I like these more.
[16:51.21]I actually like this taste more than the Cheez-Its.
[16:54.99]That's so funny.
[16:56.31]I fucking played myself bad.
[17:03.57]Okay, well, let's fucking move on.
[17:09.41]I was supposed to, like, love the Cheez-Its and be pissed and drink the antidote, and I picked the fucking Cheez-Its.
[17:15.86]God damn it.
[17:16.50]Oh, well.
[17:16.84]Sometimes you fucking try.
[17:17.74]This is what happens when you try to do a joke by yourself, okay?
[17:21.02]I don't have anybody here to help me.
[17:25.74]Let's go.
[17:26.44]Let's play this game that I fucking downloaded.
[17:38.58]Where?
[17:39.06]Can I even open the game again?
[17:40.26]I can.
[17:40.66]Thank God.
[17:44.26]Fuck.
[17:45.72]Fucking joke is ruined.
[17:47.04]How will I ever get the fucking affection of the people?
[17:51.44]Okay, let's go.
[17:55.18]Yeah, I guess we're gonna have to redo the Jerma Rumble again.
[18:01.51]Alright, what am I doing?
[18:04.79]Kicking this?
[18:05.75]Yeah.
[18:07.14]Is this too loud?
[18:07.88]How's the audio?
[18:08.92]Are we good?
[18:10.33]Can you guys like hear this?
[18:11.75]Is it too much?
[18:12.65]Too little?
[18:13.09]How come it's not told me about my spell?
[18:21.73]Oh.
[18:22.77]That way.
[18:23.13]Turn it up.
[18:24.32]No, I can just like pull it up.
[18:29.24]I can pull it up and click.
[18:30.76]Easy.
[18:31.08]Okay.
[18:32.68]Fucking easiest game.
[18:39.37]That actually, I'm like glad that happened because now I know I like cheese nips actually better.
[18:50.27]Like the joke was supposed to be like the thing that tastes like poison is Cheez-Its.
[18:54.08]God damn it.
[18:55.04]Fuck me in the face.
[18:56.04]Let's go.
[18:59.94]Fucking easy game, man.
[19:03.08]There's a weapon.
[19:06.20]Wheel up and wheel down.
[19:07.30]Got it.
[19:08.34]Cut the rope.
[19:09.67]Cut the rope.
[19:14.43]What rope?
[19:16.66]Oh, this rope.
[19:17.50]This one.
[19:18.66]Ho-ya!
[19:19.70]Got it.
[19:21.44]Excellent work.
[19:23.10]Somebody gave money, too.
[19:23.98]I need to, like, take a look over there.
[19:24.94]Holy shit, hold on.
[19:25.64]Wait, sneak.
[19:27.50]That was really far away.
[19:34.32]That was very far away.
[19:35.54]This game is fucking awesome.
[19:36.32]Is it still down?

[20:00.17]Now is the time to use your combat techniques as I taught you.
[20:03.50]Okay.
[20:04.34]Does one of them, uh, hold a lantern up?
[20:08.60]Press and hold the mouse button, then release head to refuse a power strike.

[23:54.89]I want this.
[23:56.19]I want to be able to fucking control somebody's brain.
[23:59.33]Drag and drop the icon of the spell you learned in Inventory Belt.
[24:02.17]Put it somewhere.
[24:02.77]Well, it's fine on three.
[24:05.25]Stamina, Endurance, Poison Resistance.
[24:07.76]Gonna need some of that.
[24:11.49]Uh, first of all, let me just go back and just say thank you to, uh, to Siku, Osikwe, for the five, zero, zero, zero, fifty bucks.
[24:21.25]Thanks a lot, man.

[24:38.85]Much appreciated.
[24:39.47]So let's go.
[24:42.75]Telekinesis.
[24:43.47]So I missed the thing about the... I missed the thing about adrenaline.
[24:51.31]It kind of disappeared too fast for me to see what the hell it was going to say.
[24:57.80]We're done.
[24:59.04]Okay.
[25:02.80]Enter the crystal chamber.
[25:03.92]So by the way, this is going to freak me out the whole game.
[25:07.89]When I press 1 and when I press 1 again, when I come out of that dark vision thing, it's the end of my video's sound.
[25:16.31]That's the end of the video.
[25:19.07]You'll see in a minute.
[25:20.17]Game's quiet?
[25:22.27]I'll turn it off.
[25:23.93]Stream over?
[25:24.31]What are you talking about?
[25:36.94]We've just begun.
[25:39.76]You can perform some sick shit.
[25:41.06]Wait, what do you mean it's over?
[25:45.86]Is this too bright?
[25:47.34]I'll turn the brightest down.
[25:51.24]There is a cutscene here.
[25:52.06]This is a very loud cutscene, so...
[25:56.03]Wow!
[25:56.11]This guy's right in my fucking ear!
[25:57.53]I gotta take the headphones out, this is way too loud.
[25:59.03]There's no picture?
[25:59.63]Mhm.
[26:26.42]Oh, fucking come on.
[26:28.83]You... God damn it.
[26:33.01]It crashed.
[26:35.81]Did it save there?
[26:36.95]Like, did it fucking auto-save?
[26:39.35]Oh, I am so done with this shit.
[26:42.24]I'm running it in a window.
[26:43.52]We're taking the fucking time to put it in a window.
[26:52.52]Like, fuck this shit.
[26:56.81]Get this thing up and open and put it in a fucking window.
[26:59.63]I don't think it worked.
[27:04.51]Yeah, it did.
[27:05.33]Thank fucking God.
[27:06.49]No, it didn't.
[27:07.09]Oh my God.
[27:13.19]I just want to play a fucking game.
[27:15.41]What's this command for Source Engine to make it run in no window and border?
[27:18.59]Just dash W and fucking then dash no border, right?
[27:23.17]Give me a fucking break.
[27:29.43]Just played Minecraft.
[27:32.09]No, that's looking like a possibility more and more.
[27:34.42]Like, the more that I have fucking problems with, like, trying to stream video games.
[27:39.64]It's kind of a joke.
[27:43.88]It's dash windowed dash no border, right?
[27:48.11]Yeah.
[27:49.09]Okay.
[27:49.25]Alright, fucking come on now.
[27:58.49]Ten.
[27:59.95]Ten.
[28:01.31]Did it work?
[28:04.29]Play JermaCraft.
[28:06.12]Did it actually work?
[28:07.96]I don't think it did.
[28:11.02]No, it didn't.
[28:12.94]It did not work.
[28:15.08]But it's okay.
[28:15.74]I just can't load game.
[28:17.70]Please.
[28:18.22]Thank God.
[28:19.62]When was it?
[28:20.36]What time is it right now?
[28:22.49]11.30.
[28:22.55]What the fuck are you talking about?
[28:24.63]It's 11.32.
[28:28.24]It's like 7 o'clock.
[28:30.32]Okay, it's back.
[28:33.61]We're good.
[28:38.09]Here comes a loud cutscene.
[28:42.53]Thank you, SFC100 for the bits.
[28:44.73]10 bucks.
[28:45.73]Now that we've covered the whole Cheez-It and Cheez-Nips thing, what about Mayo versus Miracle Whip?
[28:49.49]Oh, I will tell you a thousand times.
[28:51.21]No jokes, no fucking around at all.
[28:53.52]Miracle Whip is disgusting.
[28:58.61]Miracle Whip is... It tastes like rotten macaroni and cheese.
[29:03.21]Alright, skip.
[29:07.23]Let's go.
[29:08.69]Here comes a loud cutscene.
[29:11.85]Skip.
[29:13.35]Can't.
[29:21.79]Do a taste test.
[29:22.95]You see, the thing is, Cheez-Its and Cheez-Nips are very similar.
[29:27.56]Miracle Whip tastes like acid.
[29:31.18]I skipped it.
[29:32.02]Okay?
[29:32.34]I'm sorry.
[29:32.90]We had to.
[29:33.88]I ain't gonna fucking do this shit again.
[29:35.92]The gates of Stonehelm.
[29:37.74]Watch out for that fucking dragon.
[29:41.09]Can I get off and fucking boot these people?
[29:44.49]Watch out.
[29:44.89]They got fireworks in there.
[29:45.63]They're delivering fireworks.
[29:59.54]An army of necromancers!
[30:02.24]Are those pigs or are those bears?
[30:08.36]Those are pigs.
[30:11.66]I love this opening Half-Life 2 cutscene.
[30:15.64]Look at all the things going on.
[30:16.84]There's a person holding a barrel, there's a lady up there fucking dumping her shit on the street like they used to do back in old time England.
[30:23.37]There's a guy at the front of the fucking Six Flags ride saying, You can ride it, sir.
[30:26.73]You're tall enough.
[30:27.35]Of course I am.
[30:28.13]Look at how tall I am now on this horse.
[30:31.93]Ladies.
[30:34.90]Ladies and gentlemen.
[30:37.22]Fucking lady holding a baby.
[30:39.98]There's like six babies in there.
[30:41.94]I'm the envoy from Master Fenrir, with a message for the wizard Menelak.
[30:46.48]That's Lord Menelak.
[30:48.96]Got any proof?
[30:50.56]We're a little wary of strangers these days.
[30:52.95]I have a letter of introduction.
[30:54.97]Let me see it then.
[30:55.67]Oh, I thought he was saying that to me.
[30:56.93]I don't know why.
[30:57.45]By special request of Lord Menelak.
[31:02.65]Protector of the realm.
[31:04.11]Not for the king's words.
[31:04.97]Don't rip that up, sir.
[31:05.47]Not for the king's words.
[31:06.45]Better?
[31:06.65]Whoa, hold on a second.

[32:23.26]Fight them!
[32:28.45]Okay, well... I was hoping that something was gonna happen.

[39:49.47]The quest of making enemies of the Stonehelm Guards will make the main objective impossible.
[39:57.02]Don't do it.
[40:05.17]Don't fucking tell me what I can and can't do.
[40:07.81]Oh, shit.
[40:08.49]Is it because there was a witness?

[40:18.40]There's a guy right here.
[40:19.22]Okay, well, whatever.
[40:33.73]They put that shit there because they know you're going to do it.

[41:00.25]Anybody want to play Frisbee?
[41:02.85]It's easy, watch.
[41:10.93]Wasn't worth it.
[41:14.81]Wasn't worth it.
[41:21.61]I gotta like turn the fucking thing, the game, this game is dark as shit.
[41:25.19]Ooh, a shield.

[41:40.93]Later.
[41:41.19]See what I can do?
[41:42.11]I can close doors by myself.
[41:43.33]I don't even need an adult to come help me.
[42:03.56]Oh, she's talking to her.
[42:12.21]Oh, I was going to pick up the bench.
[42:14.27]I wanted to pick up the bench.
[42:17.79]No, don't give me a fucking open town with a person on a balcony.
[42:24.06]Kicker, I would have.
[42:26.22]The brightness is killing me here.
[42:31.55]I gotta turn this shit up.
[42:33.58]Like, that's... Alright, you know what I mean?
[42:36.64]That's better.
[42:37.06]I can actually, like, fucking see now.
[42:41.06]I'm not kicking her.
[42:41.84]It's not gonna happen.
[42:44.46]Alright, what do we got for objectives?
[42:47.83]Find the entrance to Menelag's mansion.
[42:51.59]Okay.
[42:54.88]What is going to happen here?
[42:57.83]There it is.
[43:01.95]What a sexual innuendo that was.
[43:03.41]Any fruits I can steal?
[43:05.35]Chicken?
[43:06.53]Fish?
[43:07.28]Sardines?
[43:07.88]Salt and pepper shakers?
[43:08.70]I could always use more of those.
[43:10.02]Okay.
[43:14.50]Talk to the young lady in front of the gate.
[43:17.21]You.
[43:18.69]Excuse me.
[43:20.07]Oh, you must be the envoy.
[43:22.37]Here's our guest.
[43:23.53]Bye, Gus.
[43:25.49]Uh, uh, okay.
[43:28.35]I'm here to see the wizard Lord Menelag.
[43:30.11]Hey, thank you, JKF, for the ten bucks.
[43:31.87]Sir Feline for the five dollars.
[43:33.33]And Slimer Joel.
[43:34.09]I was getting worried about you.
[43:34.89]I saw you before, but thanks a lot.
[43:35.93]Maybe for no reason.
[43:37.31]Uncle said you helped kill a cyclops.
[43:39.04]The CQ you gave $50 earlier.
[43:42.78]Sorry, I missed your message, whatever it was.
[43:44.38]I just can't alt-tab.
[43:46.56]For some reason, I can't put this in a window.
[43:48.06]Oh, with pleasure.
[43:49.66]I can't wait to see her.
[43:51.86]Oh, look at her bum.
[43:52.56]Oh!
[44:10.79]She's not just like, dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[44:14.19]You're a sick fuck.
[44:15.13]Like, are you just going to watch me do that and be okay with it?
[44:19.19]Welcome to the house of Menelaus.
[44:21.59]I have to just do that?
[44:23.21]I'm sorry.
[44:23.77]I'm like a compulsive fucking sicko.
[44:25.54]I had to just like kill animals and shit.
[44:28.08]Loud warning.
[44:29.92]So you're Sarith.
[44:31.94]Good to see you, lad.
[44:33.70]With those necromancers at the walls, watch it with that.
[44:36.88]I was getting worried.
[44:39.18]I trust you brought the Shantiri crystal.
[44:41.78]Of course you have.
[44:42.97]Good.
[44:43.81]I'll take that, my lad, for safekeeping.
[44:46.47]Tomorrow we sail with it.
[44:47.95]Careful with that soup there.
[44:49.83]To the Temple Isle, resting place of the Skull of Shadows.
[44:54.63]Let Arantir throw his army against the walls.
[44:57.46]We'll be off sealing his doom.
[45:00.39]Don't dismiss Arantir too lightly.
[45:02.45]There are rumors that he might be the Dark Messiah.
[45:05.35]Oh, she said it.
[45:07.91]She said it.
[45:09.63]But the time is right for the prophecy.
[45:11.53]I worry about dusty old prophecies.
[45:14.17]You worry about the expedition.
[45:15.77]You're in charge of it, after all.
[45:20.03]Of course, Uncle.
[45:21.37]Good night.
[45:21.73]That's Uncle.
[45:22.80]And to you too, Sereth.
[45:24.04]Fuck, I'm gonna look like that one day.
[45:25.66]Please don't tell me you find that sort of thing cute.
[45:29.18]Listen well, boy.
[45:30.58]I know why you're really here, but Liana doesn't.
[45:32.54]I have like a niece now.
[45:33.44]I'm going to be this old fuck in like 20 years.
[45:35.60]Henrik's business doesn't touch her.
[45:37.62]Understood?
[45:39.06]What are you talking about?
[45:41.55]Perhaps you don't know.
[45:42.63]And that's probably for the best.
[45:46.29]Servants will show you to the guest house.
[45:48.43]Get some sleep, hero.
[45:49.67]This is definitely the bad guy.
[45:52.83]Okay, that's the bad guy.
[45:53.81]The Glen of a Cold Knife.
[45:56.09]This is the bad guy.

[47:15.66]Ow.
[47:18.95]That really is so effective.

[47:30.86]Wait, he doesn't know what that was?
[47:43.45]Crates with a dragon.

[48:42.52]I'm like, I've always stayed my welcome here.
[48:43.92]I don't even know what the fuck the objective is.
[48:45.28]Find a way into Menelaide's house.
[48:46.92]Okay.
[48:47.82]Come into the hot springs.
[48:49.89]Are they too stupid to go in water?
[48:53.03]No, they're smart.
[48:55.53]You're smart enough to come in water.
[48:56.83]That's fine.
[49:01.25]The combat is actually kind of fun, though.
[49:07.82]Okay, I got adrenaline.
[49:08.66]Here we go.
[49:10.18]Not enough mana to cast this spell.
[49:11.32]Fuck you.
[49:16.14]I want to pick this guy up.
[49:18.94]Pick him up.
[49:20.30]Come on.
[49:20.58]I don't have enough mana?
[49:21.86]Oh, that's such a horse shit.
[49:28.69]I turned this fucking night vision off.
[49:36.33]Who else?
[49:36.73]Come on.
[49:37.25]You too.
[49:39.29]He's just not ready.
[49:40.13]Go drown, you fuckface.

[49:46.24]I gotta kill him.
[49:46.70]Alright, I definitely have enough, right?
[49:54.50]Where the fuck are these guys even coming from?
[49:56.04]Whatever, let's just go.
[49:59.46]I'm just gonna make my way.
[50:00.52]I feel like these guys never end.
[50:04.11]Got him.
[50:07.91]Do a meteor strike.
[50:10.90]I think this is the house, right?
[50:13.10]Keep looking.
[50:13.82]We need to get inside and secure the crystal.
[50:16.48]Okay.
[50:17.56]I'll try.
[50:18.06]I found a hatch.
[50:22.47]I found a hatch lady in my head.
[50:24.07]Oh, it... Crates with dragon insignia.
[50:29.37]I know.
[50:29.93]I haven't seen any.
[50:34.23]What?

[50:39.55]We're good.
[50:41.45]Made it.
[50:41.85]Made it into the house.
[50:44.55]Nice hatch.
[50:48.85]Holy shit.
[50:49.21]You're going to give me a fucking broom?
[50:52.76]God damn it.
[50:53.26]I want to keep the broom.
[50:57.10]What else can we do?
[50:57.86]Charm.
[51:00.12]Charm a hostile creature and get it to fight alongside you for a limited amount of time.
[51:04.79]Flame arrow.
[51:07.58]Alertness.
[51:08.44]Or I could do... I don't even know archery yet.
[51:14.15]Level 1.
[51:15.07]Flurry of blows.
[51:15.65]Allows you to deliver an unlimited number of fast strikes in a flurry.
[51:19.51]Powerful attack to stun your enemies.
[51:21.01]Sprint plus power strike.
[51:24.21]I gotta get at least the first level.
[51:28.70]Right?
[51:29.20]Of melee.
[51:29.74]Otherwise I'm gonna be fucking useless.
[51:33.18]So now I can actually do swing more than once.
[51:38.86]Yeah, now I can swing like this.
[51:41.20]And it's sprint plus power strike.
[51:45.13]Okay, that's cool.
[51:45.95]Let's get a fucking broom.
[51:49.01]Let's clean up this piece of shit town.
[51:56.13]First, I gotta get a guy.
[51:57.03]I gotta get a guy.
[51:57.57]I gotta get a guy.
[51:58.25]I gotta sweep a guy.
[51:58.95]You know what I mean?
[52:04.35]What?
[52:07.44]Who's talking?
[52:11.23]Is the person talking?
[52:14.41]There he is.
[52:14.67]Alright, get your brooms ready.
[52:16.97]Get your broomy mode ready.
[52:18.13]He just cut the broom in half.
[52:21.82]No, he didn't.
[52:26.80]Disarm him.
[52:28.38]Oh, it stunned him.
[52:35.49]Got him.
[52:37.51]No, you want to get like in the fucking wheel of cheese chamber?
[52:41.20]Not smart.
[52:46.76]Alright, that move sucks.
[52:58.39]We ain't doing that move again.
[52:59.41]Give me this.
[53:10.00]Expert swordsman apparently, yeah.
[53:13.68]Going up the stairs.
[53:14.46]I'm gonna sneak.
[53:16.49]You know what I mean?
[53:17.07]It's time to sneak.
[53:17.89]Oh.
[53:21.17]Storm of swings.
[53:23.79]And we lost the broom.
[53:27.45]Are there stealth kills in this game?
[53:31.62]I just want... Oh, come on!
[53:37.80]the other fucking direction.
[53:39.36]God damn it.
[53:40.20]It's so dark.
[53:41.79]Do I have to turn the brightness up again?
[53:48.51]What is even down here for me to do?
[53:49.93]I can go around here.
[53:53.39]There we go.
[54:02.94]The game does have health.
[54:03.74]Yeah, it's lower left.
[54:06.49]If you can't see.
[54:07.98]It's there.
[54:12.10]Dragon box.
[54:13.02]What's in here?
[54:14.84]Just a health potion, that's it.
[54:18.72]These people talking.
[54:21.10]I gotta sneak and box somebody, right?
[54:34.13]Don't forget to grab and throw objects.
[54:35.85]I know, I'm already on it.
[54:36.89]I'm already ready to do that.
[54:43.54]I can't really see over this.
[54:44.60]I feel like I'm pushing this.
[54:48.86]I thought I threw it over his head.
[54:52.78]Come on, you little shit.
[55:00.80]You just hit his own guy.
[55:01.72]Come on, keep on attacking.
[55:05.24]Swing at me.
[55:05.68]You're not going to hit your own dude or anything.
[55:10.18]I just cut his fucking head off.
[55:15.70]Let's fucking end this guy.
[55:19.45]Here we go.
[55:20.03]Power charge.
[55:20.95]Sprint.
[55:22.47]Take his fucking head off.
[55:25.89]Short sword.
[55:26.63]I mean, can I...
[55:33.00]Holy shit, this is horrible.
[55:37.78]Picking up a guy without a head.
[55:40.00]Should I carry him around?
[55:41.03]That's so terrible.
[55:45.83]Whatever, let's do it.
[55:48.07]I feel like I left, I dropped his head off and I'm trying to pretend to be him with my head.
[55:52.83]It's me, it's the guard.
[55:54.31]Fucking weekend at Bernie's.
[56:00.21]Fucking out of here.
[56:01.15]Alright, let's go.
[56:05.21]And there's that lady.
[56:06.59]That lady's dead.
[56:07.32]Uh-oh.
[56:08.68]That lady's dead.
[56:19.47]Sorry.
[56:19.93]That guy's doing a sneak, too.
[56:27.27]I gotta, like, counter-sneak this guy.
[56:31.72]What was that?
[56:36.50]I need to, like, pick an object up and fucking throw it at him.
[56:44.27]This spell sucks, by the way.
[56:46.29]Like, come on.
[56:50.49]That spell is so stupid.
[56:54.69]What does that spell even achieve?
[56:56.77]Absolute garbage.
[57:03.41]I want the high ground.
[57:12.62]Down the stairs.
[57:13.16]Kick him down the stairs.
[57:13.98]It's effective.
[57:17.43]He needs stamina.
[57:21.63]Flank him on the stairs.
[57:26.87]I gotta fucking move.
[57:29.75]Into the fire with you.
[57:32.24]You guys make a whole lot of demands of each other, but nobody actually does anything.
[57:38.38]Into the fire.
[57:44.41]Come on.
[57:47.27]Fine, if you won't, fine.
[57:48.57]He's not going to go on the fire.
[57:49.61]There he is.
[57:51.69]Of course he is.
[57:54.15]Short sword.
[57:54.77]I need a heal.
[57:58.52]Alright, so how do I activate this adrenaline thing?
[58:03.32]Is it a certain button prompt or something?
[58:05.76]I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
[58:13.99]I'm gonna pick this up.
[58:18.49]Anything else on these tables?
[58:19.55]Don't think so.
[58:23.71]These doors open?
[58:25.61]No, they don't.
[58:26.87]Why would they?
[58:32.21]When you have adrenaline, you do a power attack.
[58:34.62]Okay.
[58:38.06]Let's do a power attack when it's activated.
[58:39.84]Okay.
[58:42.20]Really?
[58:45.49]Alright, power attack.
[58:49.43]Power attack!
[58:53.05]Ooh, that was sick.
[58:55.89]Now I know why they call it a fucking adrenaline rush.
[59:02.89]Wait till I get this back.
[59:08.49]You're a good shot.
[59:12.57]You're a good shot, but not good enough.
[59:18.19]See ya!
[59:19.39]What'd you get?
[59:19.79]Anything on you?
[59:22.64]I guess these guys don't drop anything.
[59:24.90]What about you?
[59:33.22]Yeah, you're worthless, Timmy!
[59:36.89]Want anything in the fucking closet?
[59:39.29]Yeah.
[59:39.91]We got health potion, we got a pie, mana potion...
[59:44.24]There's some dirty laundry.
[59:45.45]Lots of dirty laundry.
[59:46.51]You know, I've used this tactic before myself.
[59:49.07]If you're ever going to have company over, here's a fucking tactic that you can use.
[59:51.97]You can take this from me.
[59:54.29]You got a shitload of laundry that you haven't done?
[59:56.01]It's alright.
[59:56.45]You got, like, friends coming over.
[59:57.43]You got, like, a girl coming over.
[59:58.31]You got, like, a boy coming over.
[59:59.19]You want to, like, impress them.
[60:00.40]Just get a fucking closet you know is empty.
[60:02.70]And stuff all your dirty blankets, all your dirty laundry, everything that's gross.
[60:07.02]Stuff it in a fucking closet.
[60:08.74]And then wipe your table with, like, a Clorox wipe.
[60:12.22]Ready for company.
[60:14.35]No one's gonna open your closets.
[60:22.09]Really?
[60:22.59]Alright, well, that happened.
[60:28.03]What?
[60:29.55]Don't you guys see that something else way more important is going on?
[60:33.85]Cut ropes to, okay, let's trap this guy.
[60:37.17]What is this connected to?
[60:38.06]The giant chandelier.
[60:39.60]Alright, how do I get him to stay under here?
[60:42.70]Come over here and stay over here.
[60:48.76]Is he there?
[60:54.28]I thought the damn chandelier was going to go the other way.
[60:56.82]Alright, fine.
[60:58.50]Ready?
[60:58.66]Here we go.
[60:59.04]God damn it.
[61:02.21]I knew it was going to fucking happen.
[61:06.15]I was trying to run him around.
[61:09.29]Fucking hell.
[61:09.85]It's okay.
[61:10.25]We're right here.
[61:10.65]This is dangerous.
[61:14.46]This is like playing tetherball with a bunch of friends.
[61:17.97]Done.
[61:18.91]Got him.
[61:20.17]Get this guy too.
[61:22.75]Got him.
[61:23.95]Easy game.
[61:27.77]I'm just going to wait and everyone that comes up here is going to go... It's just chicken.
[61:44.73]It's just so dangerous.
[61:46.79]That guy disappeared.
[61:49.07]That hurt that guy so bad that he fucking disappeared.
[61:53.22]I gotta get this guy.
[61:54.26]Come on.
[61:54.80]Ooh, that sucks.
[62:00.28]Does it make it to the crown?
[62:03.52]I don't think it makes it to the throne.
[62:06.36]I gotta sit this guy on the throne and then he's gonna get hit by this.
[62:09.63]Alright, wait.
[62:10.33]Here it comes.
[62:11.91]Sit him on the fucking throne.
[62:13.25]Come on, get on the throne.
[62:15.20]Get on the throne!
[62:15.88]Sit him on the throne!
[62:17.32]Shit!
[62:18.62]It's very important that I sit this guy on the throne.
[62:25.08]Get on the fucking throne!
[62:27.17]There it is!
[62:27.75]Sit him on the throne!
[62:29.33]Sit him on the... Fuck you.
[62:34.93]You ruined the joke.
[62:38.85]Okay, we're good.
[62:39.33]Let's heal a little bit here.
[62:42.35]This can't open.
[62:43.05]Of course not.
[62:46.11]Dude, that one guy that was still on the ground that got fucking annihilated was perfect.
[62:58.11]I can get this guy, right?
[63:02.95]This is the worst sneak ever.
[63:04.17]Oh, come on.
[63:08.54]Don't you dare.
[63:17.35]This guy was like checking out his shoes.
[63:21.23]He lost his bow.
[63:23.21]Now I got it.
[63:23.75]I got his bow.
[63:28.67]Alright, well, that guy took a long time to figure out what just happened.
[63:40.52]Yeah, I got like cement in my shoes.
[63:43.20]I'm really good at sneaking.
[63:46.88]We're good.
[63:47.28]I like the bow.
[63:47.86]The bow's fun.
[63:51.18]Did I do that?
[63:57.58]Gotta drop it a little more.
[63:58.56]It's a little intense for me right now.
[63:59.88]There we go.
[64:00.22]That's better.
[64:02.36]Yeah, let's go upstairs.
[64:04.56]See you later.
[64:05.16]Sayonara.
[64:09.50]Sneak right over here.
[64:11.24]Get this guy with a headshot.
[64:16.13]It bobs.
[64:17.63]Got him.
[64:18.71]It bobs up and down.
[64:19.71]Who else?
[64:21.63]Who else is in the library?
[64:26.77]You don't want to fuck with a stealth archer.
[64:28.35]Okay, that was right in his head.
[64:31.93]Give me a break.
[64:39.38]What the fuck?
[64:40.10]Come on.
[64:40.90]I'm trying to be melee archer.
[64:47.98]What the fuck, dude?
[64:49.18]How many of these do you have to take?
[64:52.66]Wow.
[64:53.66]I am fucking shocked.
[65:00.50]He's not dead.
[65:03.18]Finally.
[65:03.68]Alright, Archer sucks.
[65:09.76]Alright, let's get... I could go two ways there.
[65:13.33]Pull this.
[65:15.55]Whatever this does.
[65:19.47]Gives me a way up.
[65:20.71]Alright, about through here.
[65:21.61]I just want to see what's up here.
[65:24.87]A lot of shit.
[65:25.63]Okay, there's an old key.
[65:27.09]Some arrows.
[65:29.41]Some fruits and vegetables.
[65:31.23]Some orders.
[65:33.30]And there's another box.
[65:34.04]Alright, I think I went up here.
[65:38.50]No stealth bonus.
[65:41.70]No, not quite.
[65:48.81]Speaking of stealth, speaking of itchy backs, I got a real itchy back right now.
[65:52.60]Alright, we're good.
[65:56.70]Am I gonna go through the glass like fucking Batman?
[66:04.56]I can't fucking break through that glass?
[66:07.57]Oh God.
[66:11.33]This is dangerous.
[66:13.71]It's alright, I can just kick him off.
[66:15.55]He's trying to do the same thing to me.
[66:16.99]Don't you dare Dark Souls me.
[66:18.37]I wanna Dark Souls you.
[66:20.95]I can't... Kick him!
[66:25.53]Holy shit!
[66:26.45]Alright, I broke his back.
[66:35.58]I broke his fucking back.
[66:36.74]Good.
[66:40.84]What is this?
[66:41.66]A stool.
[66:44.76]Where'd it go?
[66:47.00]It already broke.
[66:47.76]Give me a fucking break.
[66:58.20]Hey, we got a loading screen.
[67:01.86]You have anal fissures and they are really hurting, but my stream's really helping you through it.
[67:05.58]Hey, well, guess what, buddy?
[67:07.44]I know what that's like.
[67:09.84]It sucks.
[67:10.79]Hopefully you're doing alright.
[67:11.83]Chili Breeze.
[67:13.97]This guy's ass is gonna get kicked off, right?
[67:15.53]That little noise was perfect.
[67:16.97]Ooh, a bottle of berry juice!
[67:43.57]Shield?
[67:44.01]What am I supposed to do with all this stuff?
[67:52.04]Alright, let's see.
[67:52.66]Can I make a thousand points here?
[67:54.02]I gotta burn his body.
[67:56.02]Look, right now we are respecting this guy.
[67:59.44]I wouldn't want to be left over there to rot with the birds to eat my fucking guts.
[68:05.23]I would want to be burnt.
[68:06.13]That's the respectful thing to do.
[68:07.47]We're being respectful.
[68:14.48]Sorry, the birds will get him.
[68:16.08]No worry.
[68:22.86]Fucking worms will get him.
[68:23.78]No worries, he'll be alright.
[68:26.80]Do I have to sleep in this guy's magic bed?
[68:30.10]Scroll of weakening, scroll of charm.
[68:31.48]Am I gonna, like, jump out the window?
[68:43.88]Is this like a, can I fly?
[68:45.60]What is this?
[68:50.38]That's where I just was.
[68:51.18]There's gotta be something I can do here, right?
[68:55.75]I can't like fly out the window?
[69:00.65]What the fuck?
[69:08.11]I wanna like... What's the objective?
[69:13.30]He's probably in his bedroom.
[69:14.60]He's not in his bedroom.
[69:16.77]I can assure you of that.
[69:23.57]Uh, okay.
[69:25.39]Not in his bedroom.
[69:28.21]There's another way to go, though.
[69:29.41]No, there's not.
[69:34.04]Fly out the window.
[69:34.72]I'm not gonna fly out the window.
[69:36.84]What's that?
[69:38.82]There's another spot to go over here.
[69:40.14]Okay.
[69:42.07]Can I knock this down?
[69:44.87]No, those are fucking marshmallows.
[69:46.12]You can't kick those.
[69:48.42]What's with the low gravity?
[69:53.74]Please get up there, dude.
[69:55.34]Oh my god.
[69:56.04]What a fucking disaster.
[70:01.91]I'm so paranoid I'm going to fly off the edge.
[70:06.15]Okay, but it's going to fucking walk off the right way.
[70:11.40]Just so you know, dear, Menelag is expendable.
[70:14.10]The crystal isn't.
[70:15.94]What do you mean?
[70:17.08]The crystal was for Menelag.
[70:19.46]Menelag is convenient, that's all.
[70:21.32]What matters is getting the crystal to that temple, and you... Guy gonna be in the window.
[70:31.09]Okay, gotta be easy here.
[70:35.93]What?
[70:37.15]What the fuck just happened?
[70:39.05]What?
[70:39.51]You won't make it.
[70:52.73]Hold on a second.
[71:00.43]I'm having some trouble.
[71:06.98]I almost got all three of them.
[71:11.60]Wait, what if I walk him over here?
[71:15.34]Okay, they're idiots.
[71:16.22]I can do this.
[71:17.86]They are so dumb.
[71:18.82]Don't worry.
[71:24.61]Alright, that guy just like... That guy tried to jump over this and he died.
[71:31.77]What about you?
[71:33.75]Can you make the jump?
[71:36.05]Apparently, you can't.
[71:37.50]Apparently, you can't make that jump.
[71:39.80]Good try, though.
[71:41.28]That was worth a shot.
[71:43.24]Oh shit, my colleague just tried to jump over and he died.
[71:46.56]What do I do?
[71:47.18]I should jump over and die too.
[71:52.14]This game is fucking phenomenal.
[71:55.63]What a fucking 10 out of 10 game.
[71:57.99]I love it.
[71:58.43]This is where they all died.
[72:00.09]Hey, we gotta be respectful here.
[72:05.17]I ain't no disrespectful fucking streamer.
[72:08.71]You burn the bodies.
[72:13.32]But in doing so, you've got to try to get 10 points.
[72:17.44]In doing so, sometimes you've got to go for a score.
[72:20.50]We can be respectful, but we can also go for a fucking score.
[72:25.26]This is respectful.
[72:28.88]See?
[72:33.78]Just because you need to be respectful doesn't mean you can't have a little bit of fun.
[72:36.66]Don't ever forget that.
[72:38.62]twitch.tv.
[72:39.76]Where am I going?
[72:45.71]Oh, I could have knocked him into that, too.
[72:47.59]Look at all these random things to knock over and break.
[72:49.65]I love it.
[72:56.83]Anybody in here?
[72:58.33]See?
[72:58.61]Look at you.
[72:58.89]This guy has the fucking right idea.
[73:00.05]I should probably drink a potion.
[73:08.26]My inventory is a fucking joke right now.
[73:09.92]Hold on.
[73:13.72]Can't even hold these shields.
[73:16.23]I'll keep that on.
[73:18.15]Let's move this.
[73:19.49]Let's get these 1, 2, 3.
[73:20.11]Let's do 8 and 2 health.
[73:28.27]What a waste of fucking... Those things are awful.
[73:30.23]Okay, full health potion.
[73:31.37]I'm going to put it at 7.
[73:33.19]And I'm ready to rock and roll.
[73:36.92]And a potion.
[73:39.08]Get to full health.
[73:41.56]Let's keep on moving.
[73:46.60]I'm going to hide behind the curtain.
[73:49.91]Yeah, you definitely did.
[73:50.81]You heard something.
[73:57.37]You can't sneak in this game.
[73:58.53]Do I have to get a stealth thing?
[74:05.75]I definitely have to get a stealth perk.
[74:13.23]I feel like I'm a cartoon character with these gigantic feet.
[74:18.02]I'm like a frog.
[74:22.80]No, that's the wrong button.
[74:25.04]It's always that.
[74:25.78]Okay, my brain got fucked up because I'm pressing the wrong buttons.
[74:35.53]Give him a fucking flurry.
[74:37.15]Oh, that was dramatic.
[74:49.57]This guy's still living.
[74:50.51]Come on.
[74:54.07]Nice block.
[74:54.99]I'll give that to you.
[75:03.59]Don't you ever fucking tell you that again.
[75:07.07]Short sword.
[75:09.23]That was a pretty cinematic fight.
[75:10.39]Now watch this.
[75:11.57]I'm gonna hit somebody with a fucking ironing board.
[75:13.45]Alright, alright.
[75:17.99]Ironing board a banana.
[75:20.25]How does the next guy deserve to die?
[75:24.61]Let's go with ironing board.
[75:33.20]If you kill Leanna or Leanna dies, your mission is a failure.
[75:36.22]What?
[75:36.56]Where is she?
[75:37.84]Where are they?
[75:41.12]Where are they?
[75:44.42]Oh, he's in there.
[75:45.10]Get the banana.
[75:55.13]Let me in!
[75:58.13]What's burning?
[75:58.55]What's happening to me?
[76:02.57]God damn it, I can't bring the coffee cup.
[76:05.91]Wait, what?
[76:06.31]What's going on?
[76:07.19]Where are they?
[76:11.40]Where the fuck are they?
[76:17.44]I don't even know where the fuck they were.
[76:24.64]I don't get it.
[76:26.26]Stairs?
[76:28.20]Like, up here?
[76:32.31]Fuck, well, I gotta go get something else to throw at the guy.

[77:04.75]What do I do?
[77:07.17]What?
[77:08.24]Oh, it's a fucking force fight.
[77:13.10]He's dead.
[77:16.32]What's going on?
[77:16.76]Come on.
[77:20.34]She killed him.
[77:21.38]This is just a facade.
[77:24.83]Look, I know he's dead, but I'm currently paralyzed.
[77:26.81]Do something about it.
[77:27.81]Help me.
[77:28.11]I got it!
[77:31.97]We're gonna see a death scream.
[77:38.12]He's gone!
[77:38.56]He bounced off his face.

[79:41.22]Oh, fuck.
[79:46.55]The ghoul has the crystal.
[79:53.51]It's not paused.
[79:55.31]I thought, no, god damn it.
[79:57.14]Hey, hey, come on.
[80:09.56]Come here.

[80:28.36]How do I, how do I quick save?
[80:33.37]What's a quick save button?
[80:35.61]So I can not do this shit again.
[80:42.81]Yeah.

[80:58.88]Oh, parry.
[80:59.26]Okay, kick.
[81:02.13]Parry.

[81:27.28]Okay, now go get the crystal.
[81:28.36]I don't even care.
[81:28.96]I don't even listen to this shit.
[81:32.54]No, we don't have time.
[81:36.01]Don't got time.
[81:38.23]Quest save.

[81:47.85]Alright.
[81:48.25]Let's figure this out.
[81:48.95]Don't fucking die.
[81:49.79]We gotta go this way.
[81:51.41]Nothing.
[81:51.75]No secrets.
[81:52.83]No skills.
[81:53.57]I can fucking hit him with an arrow.
[81:55.27]Watch this one.
[81:57.21]Watch this one on fucking twitch.tv.
[81:58.79]This is a fucking gaming website.
[82:01.19]Mm-hmm.
[82:06.33]I don't think I don't know this is a fucking gaming website, guys.
[82:09.94]Almost had it.
[82:13.13]It's gone.
[82:14.31]Not if you follow it across the rooftops.
[82:16.31]Quickly.
[82:16.67]Come on.
[82:19.23]This is a dead end.
[82:20.15]Try the other way.
[82:25.92]Do I have to grab the tree like a bear?
[82:31.00]Hold on a minute.
[82:31.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[82:33.04]Wait a second.
[82:37.16]Where's the developer console?
[82:45.27]How do I change FOV?
[82:48.21]It's FOV, right?
[82:51.11]FOV underscore How do I do it?
[82:55.39]FOV I'm going to make it 90.
[83:01.40]FOV FOV desired 90 Unknown command.
[83:14.98]FOV desired 90.
[83:16.34]Unknown command.
[83:22.11]Please, FOV.
[83:25.03]SV cheats.
[83:25.89]1.
[83:27.43]Okay.
[83:29.07]FOV desired 90.
[83:31.99]Unknown command.
[83:35.35]FOV 90.
[83:35.99]There we go.
[83:39.55]Looks like it is 90.
[83:44.87]That doesn't actually do anything.
[83:50.23]Bind all.
[83:54.56]FOV.
[83:59.54]FOV.
[83:59.90]140.
[84:00.48]Doesn't do anything.
[84:06.64]There's no... He's escaping.
[84:15.53]Post time scale.
[84:16.81]Oh my god.
[84:19.33]View model FOV.
[84:23.69]View model FOV.
[84:24.47]Bingo, right?
[84:25.78]No, no, no, no, no.
[84:26.50]That's not what I want.
[84:28.74]FOV.
[84:28.96]85 is fine for that.
[84:44.52]You're in radius, not degrees.
[84:46.20]View model FOV.
[84:54.19]Fucking whatever.
[84:54.85]Okay, let's go.
[85:08.48]Oh, this is going to make me fucking throw up.
[85:10.83]I got it.
[85:11.19]Don't worry.
[85:11.61]I have the flash.
[85:13.39]It's me, the Crimson Chin.
[85:14.47]It's me, Mr. Spaghetti.
[85:18.27]I'm done with this joke.
[85:20.19]It hurts.
[85:34.50]85.
[85:34.54]Okay, so what is the... How do I actually... Can you actually change it?
[85:42.40]FOV desire?
[85:43.16]Like, I don't understand.
[85:45.08]Like, shouldn't it do something?
[85:50.37]Like, it's not doing anything.
[85:52.65]Whatever.
[86:07.98]That would have been so sick.
[86:11.40]How do I get... Go.
[86:21.80]Careful.
[86:22.32]Those shingles are... She told me to be careful about shingles, and I don't even know what the fuck she's talking about.
[86:27.56]Go, go, go.
[86:40.20]Holy god damn it!
[86:42.36]I'm so busy talking about fucking FOV, I can't even concentrate.
[86:50.21]There we go.
[86:54.43]Got it.
[86:54.69]I don't know if that did anything, though.
[87:18.19]FOV number works.
[87:22.33]Fucking FOV.
[87:24.25]Where is he even going?
[87:26.61]I like, I can't, where am I supposed to go?
[87:30.15]This way, I guess.
[87:33.09]I have no idea.
[87:34.91]In one of these windows?
[87:39.98]Through here.
[87:40.40]There's no other way.
[87:45.52]Jump!
[87:46.84]Don't tell me to do that, because I will do it, because I'm fucking stupid.
[87:52.00]I'll get him right here.
[87:52.96]No stamina.
[87:53.94]Fuck.
[87:54.67]No stamina.
[87:57.35]Why did I do that?
[87:59.75]Oh, you shithead.
[88:13.41]Okay.
[88:13.89]Stamina.
[88:14.47]Build up the stamina, and then we're going for it.
[88:18.68]Hurry up.
[88:30.09]Oh my fucking god damn it.
[88:31.73]I'm okay.
[88:32.31]We're okay.
[88:34.35]Where is he?
[88:41.54]I don't understand.
[88:47.92]I'm on the ground.
[88:51.84]Am I supposed to be down here?
[89:00.77]Where's this fucking ladder?
[89:01.71]Oh my god.
[89:03.47]Everything's so fucking dark.
[89:04.95]I can't handle how dark this game is.
[89:08.05]It's like the darkest fucking game ever.
[89:11.52]Even when it's a light out.
[89:12.76]It don't matter.
[89:17.58]Shut up, lady.
[89:19.50]I'll find the Borderlands treasure, I promise.
[89:21.60]Shut the fuck up.
[89:32.23]Where is he now?
[89:32.73]Where's the crystal now?
[89:35.75]I did it.
[89:46.99]I got six skill points for that.
[89:49.59]Let's put them in.
[89:52.80]What do I need?
[89:53.38]Seven skill points.
[89:57.72]Three.
[89:58.08]How many do I have?
[89:58.62]Six.
[90:05.78]Alright.
[90:06.08]Freeze or fire trap?
[90:12.11]Freeze.
[90:12.45]I can get them both.
[90:15.29]Lightning bolt is next.
[90:17.61]But, ah, no.
[90:18.61]Let's do... Another one of the melee.
[90:28.79]Oh, no, I wanted the archery.
[90:29.81]I can zoom in when I use the bow.
[90:32.31]Adrenaline strength.
[90:37.89]Endurance.
[90:38.57]Poison resist.
[90:39.49]Vitality.
[90:40.23]Mana regen.
[90:41.27]Mana affinity.
[90:43.85]Let's just put one in here.
[90:45.11]I'll go down here later.
[90:46.67]Alright, so I got some spells now.
[90:48.04]Let's move this shit out of the way.
[90:51.54]Telekinesis sucks, so I'm going to move it off the bar.
[90:55.76]Flame Arrow could be cool.
[90:57.14]Freeze, we'll keep that here.
[91:00.69]Put these over there.
[91:01.57]Flame Arrow, let's just... Whatever, like five and six.
[91:08.36]Okay.
[91:09.32]Cast charm when used.
[91:11.02]Cast weaken.
[91:11.56]These are just dumb scrolls.
[91:12.66]Okay, cool.
[91:14.64]Let's heal first.
[91:18.29]So three.
[91:19.99]I have it.
[91:20.77]Okay, I have hulk hands now.
[91:22.77]I've got blue hulk hands.
[91:23.85]Did I just go back up?
[91:28.45]I don't even know.
[91:31.59]I think I just went back up when I wasn't supposed to.
[91:37.28]Yeah, like I wasn't supposed to.
[91:41.94]It begins.
[91:51.17]What am I supposed to do here?
[91:55.31]This way?
[91:55.65]I hope it crashes again.
[92:01.09]Don't say that!
[92:05.01]Ah, the whole... That's the one complaint I have about the game, is how the whole game is just black.
[92:14.09]And you can turn the whole game blue or black.
[92:25.92]And which color would you like to see?
[92:27.68]Blue or black?
[92:32.89]Can't open this.
[92:35.84]Oh, mushrooms.
[92:36.34]I don't know what these are for, but I'm going to take them.
[92:39.88]Trap?
[92:41.48]What's the objective?
[92:43.38]Infiltrate the warehouse.
[92:49.42]Well, I obviously can't go up.
[92:50.44]That's definitely the way to go.
[92:51.42]I'm going to the fucking sewer with all the rats.
[93:07.92]Climb.
[93:08.46]Alright, here I am.
[93:16.55]I'm in the Necromancer's Outpost.
[93:25.79]Well, I just hurt myself, probably.
[93:32.42]What was that?
[93:38.80]What?
[93:41.14]Uh... I thought it said I could, like, fucking... Didn't it say I could put shit on the ground?
[93:46.18]Well, I have no idea how that works.
[93:57.17]Not enough mana to cast the spell.
[94:04.25]God, I have no fucking mana.
[94:08.65]Hit the floor?
[94:09.23]I just did it to the fucking floor!
[94:10.55]And it didn't do anything!
[94:16.72]I shot it at the floor and it exploded.
[94:19.06]Did it hit the stool?
[94:22.12]How much mana do you need to cast this spell?
[94:25.06]Half your fucking mana bar?
[94:28.92]Holy shit.
[94:31.54]Well, we get to do this once, apparently.
[94:37.32]Alright, we're gonna have to do this later because it takes your entire mana bar to cast Wadden Freeze.
[94:43.82]Alright, now we're gonna have to do something different here.
[94:49.98]We're gonna be a little fucking weird here.
[94:56.90]This is much easier than playing the actual game.
[94:59.86]You don't have to play the game.
[95:02.64]You can just kick.
[95:03.84]It's so much better.
[95:07.15]Easy.
[95:07.43]That's how you get points.
[95:14.42]He just killed them both.
[95:18.48]Give me some stamina.
[95:19.76]It'll be easy.
[95:22.10]Come on.
[95:22.86]Line it up.
[95:24.62]See ya.
[95:27.49]That's how I should be playing the game.
[95:28.57]I don't know why I'm playing it any differently.
[95:30.39]Where did you come from?
[95:39.55]Somebody had a key.
[95:40.41]Okay, I got a key.
[95:44.87]Bye-bye.
[95:48.19]Any potions or anything?
[95:51.71]You don't look like you're in good shape.
[95:58.32]Come on.
[95:58.76]Come and get me.
[96:01.90]Don't be a fool.
[96:05.53]Yes, you almost had it.
[96:06.83]One more step and you'll get it.
[96:09.12]You're almost there.
[96:09.80]You almost have me.
[96:13.70]You almost got me.
[96:15.60]Ooh, he caught himself.
[96:22.32]I will make you die.
[96:24.09]I will make you kill yourself.
[96:25.67]I'm not gonna do it.
[96:28.27]You will do it.
[96:29.75]I'm certain of that.
[96:30.47]You will do it.
[96:31.13]You're a fucking idiot.
[96:32.35]You are stupid.
[96:38.21]What?
[96:39.67]How?
[96:44.07]Should I freeze the floor, like, underneath him?
[96:45.77]Alright, we're gonna make this guy slip and slide into the fucking dungeon.
[96:51.26]That sounds like fun.
[96:54.08]I don't have enough mana to cast it.
[96:55.52]Come on, give me a fucking break.
[97:05.53]Okay, come on.
[97:13.64]That guy just broke his neck.
[97:17.23]Oh, this game is fucking phenomenal.
[97:20.69]What a wonderful fucking... What is going... Get down!
[97:38.46]Stay down.
[97:39.08]Get... Oh, my God.
[97:41.04]I can't die here.
[97:42.46]F6.
[97:42.50]What?
[97:42.64]This guy's giving up.
[97:43.54]He gave up.
[97:43.84]I could kick him down the stairs, but I'm not going to.
[97:46.16]We're going to let him do his thing.
[97:48.90]Do your thing.
[97:49.18]Go on.
[97:49.32]Go find the other friends.
[98:11.17]Almost.
[98:11.57]You know, I gave up.
[98:15.97]I had to fucking just... I had to do it.
[98:17.37]Alright, we're gonna make them slip into the fucking fire.
[98:26.33]Tomb of the Dragonfly, steel bar.
[98:29.06]Tools for making a sword hilt.
[98:32.88]Well, I need to heal.
[98:33.70]We're gonna have to do like a puzzle here.
[98:43.44]I need to put a steel bar in there.
[98:48.14]Got to heat it up.
[98:49.64]That's nice and hot.
[98:54.61]Gone.
[98:54.89]I need to put the other thing in there too.
[98:59.91]What else goes in here?
[99:05.43]Tomb of the dragonfly?
[99:06.37]A mushroom?
[99:11.43]I don't understand.
[99:12.45]Like, shouldn't that be heating up?
[99:13.71]No.
[99:13.87]I have to, like, actually press this button.
[99:17.87]I thought I was just gonna do it automatically.
[99:19.21]I don't think I had to actually do it.
[99:21.24]Okay.
[99:25.26]And then dunk my fucking head in there.
[99:26.70]A blade.
[99:33.28]Congratulations.
[99:33.90]You crafted blade.
[99:35.00]A sword blade.
[99:43.16]Okay.
[99:58.99]What happened?
[100:03.09]Do I have to put it back in here?
[100:13.57]Use the blade on the hilt maker.
[100:15.57]How the fuck do you do that?
[100:20.02]I just did that.
[100:20.58]The blade's not ready to be finished.
[100:22.22]What the fuck are you talking about?
[100:28.74]Oh, my fucking head.
[100:29.42]Of course.
[100:29.86]A fucking headless tiny little dumb hammer.
[100:32.56]Okay, here we go.
[100:36.26]Doing a good job.
[100:37.22]Okay.
[100:43.58]What do you mean the blade's not hot enough?
[100:51.76]How could the blade not be hot enough?
[100:54.86]Go pour some more goo on it.
[101:05.23]Alright.
[101:05.75]Get it in there.
[101:06.31]Heat it up.
[101:07.79]Grab it with your fucking bare hands.
[101:15.28]You hammer the blade into shape.
[101:17.79]Cool.
[101:19.85]What did I do?
[101:22.65]Short sword.
[101:26.27]Where did it go?
[101:28.71]There it is.
[101:33.44]Long sword.
[101:35.64]Got it.
[101:36.02]Okay, look at that.
[101:37.68]Long sword, guys.
[101:38.72]Look at this one.
[101:42.72]It's like, dude, come on, give me a break.
[101:43.64]It like blended in with the fucking video game.
[101:45.70]I don't give a shit for that one.
[101:51.18]This game's like fucking one color.
[101:53.39]Look, I don't even know if this is an entryway to a cave or a monster's mouth with teeth.
[101:56.49]I don't know.
[101:57.09]It's all black.
[102:05.81]It's fucking like a mushroom cave that we're in right now.
[102:08.09]What is this?
[102:08.53]A ring of arcane brilliance.
[102:13.74]A magic ring must be equipped in your inventory to grant you its special.
[102:15.80]Note that only one ring can be equipped.
[102:18.50]Make your choices wisely.
[102:19.60]Okay, what does it do?
[102:23.72]I have it on.
[102:25.96]Add 10 mana.
[102:27.04]Nice.
[102:27.68]Okay.
[102:30.08]Cool.
[102:34.26]Magic affinity.
[102:35.04]Let's get our fucking mana up so we can actually do things.
[102:46.68]Sorry.
[102:47.96]That was mean.
[102:48.54]Hey, did you hear what happened to the... I guess telling the other guy a joke.
[102:59.85]Hey, did you hear the one about the guy, about the soldier that had a knife through his neck?
[103:05.93]He sure was sitting pretty.
[103:08.51]Wasn't he?
[103:10.03]Wasn't he?
[103:12.11]Oh, wasn't he?
[103:16.84]Can I spear this guy?
[103:21.97]Am I visible in the dark?
[103:27.67]What about the hammer?
[103:28.57]I think I'm with the fucking blacksmith hammer out here.
[103:31.15]No, I don't.
[103:31.67]That's fucking dumb.
[103:32.31]And I fucking just smashed into the wall.
[103:34.15]Give me a fucking break.
[103:35.57]Alright, we're going to make this guy slip and slide into... I don't know.
[103:41.72]I'm going to use the sword.
[103:48.47]Yeah.
[103:48.69]It's supposed to be a long sword.
[103:53.92]Why is the long sword harder to hit people with than the short sword?
[103:55.96]It's like not as long.
[104:01.58]Rush him.
[104:05.34]Okay, that guy's hurt.
[104:09.69]That guy's dead.
[104:10.21]And you will soon be dead too.
[104:17.47]dummy.
[104:19.35]Okay, we're good.
[104:21.96]Continue.
[104:31.24]Dragon chest.
[104:33.20]Ooh, lots of fucking hamsteaks.
[104:35.84]I like that.
[104:38.21]Wood.
[104:41.53]What is the objective again?
[104:42.55]I'm like infiltrating this like necromancer's evil lair.
[104:48.28]Sounds fun.
[105:03.23]Come get me.
[105:04.77]You can do it again.
[105:05.81]Come and get me.
[105:06.31]I'm right here.
[105:08.15]What?
[105:09.23]Aww.
[105:10.29]I love how stupid they are with that.
[105:15.58]It's great.
[105:21.29]There goes his head.
[105:23.83]Excellent.
[105:25.13]Excellent.
[105:28.79]No melting ice.
[105:29.75]Yeah, that's not fair.
[105:31.29]You're taking away my fun time.
[105:35.63]Nobody ever takes away my fun time.
[105:38.63]But me.
[105:43.05]Here we go.
[105:43.45]We're back here again.
[105:44.19]Great.
[105:48.07]Can you throw the heads?
[105:49.31]I don't think so.
[105:53.41]Is that guy sleeping?
[105:55.79]I think that guy's asleep.
[106:03.51]Can I do this shit to his bed?
[106:07.30]Oh no, it's armor.
[106:10.62]What is this, a katana?
[106:13.56]Ring of the Weapon Master.
[106:15.94]Fucking secret, guys.
[106:19.35]Hold on a second.
[106:22.15]God, I thought that guy was asleep.
[106:23.33]This game's fucking dark.
[106:24.73]This game's dark, alright?
[106:26.12]That proves it.
[106:28.78]Let me take a look at that fucking katana.
[106:33.44]Requires critical hit one.
[106:36.79]What if I get critical hit one?
[106:46.07]Strength, adrenaline, critical hit.
[106:48.11]Okay.
[106:48.83]I can go down this way, right?
[106:52.49]I think.
[106:54.85]Well, where's the armor?
[106:56.51]Did I put it on automatically?
[106:59.31]Doesn't look like it's on.
[107:02.21]What's that ring?
[107:12.17]I want the mana.
[107:15.51]What happened to the... Oh, I can't do it.
[107:16.69]I need endurance.
[107:18.59]Shit!
[107:20.33]God damn it.
[107:21.88]They make you have to make choices in this game.
[107:26.26]That's fine.
[107:27.62]Little stick.
[107:28.12]Let me just move some of this shit.
[107:29.80]Flame arrow is cool, but I'm not using it at all.
[107:32.82]Blacksmith hammer can get out of here.
[107:35.58]The health potion up there.
[107:38.77]A book explaining how to use a forge.
[107:43.27]Well, here was the instruction manual.
[107:48.06]Oh, I'm gonna hold on to that.
[107:51.50]A book on somebody's weakness?
[107:55.28]Okay, well.
[107:57.48]Can I eventually sell shit?
[107:59.34]I feel like I have a lot of stuff in my inventory right now.
[108:03.85]All you had to do was read.
[108:05.13]Yeah, but who reads?
[108:10.51]I don't have time to read.
[108:13.02]Reading means I can't.
[108:13.99]We got more shit.
[108:16.89]Is this guy alive?
[108:22.59]Poison, Chris.
[108:23.47]Getting a handwritten note.
[108:24.57]We're getting all kinds of fucking items now.
[108:28.21]Alright, we got like the fucking... And we got a shovel.
[108:31.49]God damn it.
[108:34.70]God damn it.
[108:35.64]And I can't even get it.
[108:38.26]What the fuck?
[108:40.44]I thought it was a melee weapon.
[108:41.52]What's this handwritten note?
[108:44.76]As we decided last week, I will help you enter the warehouse in the city.
[108:47.12]I'll wait in the caverns tomorrow at midnight.
[108:50.82]Come with my reward.
[108:52.33]You'll have everything you need.
[108:53.13]Don't worry about our business.
[108:54.05]I keep it a secret.
[108:57.45]Caverns.
[108:58.25]Tomorrow at midnight.
[109:00.07]Okay.
[109:07.03]Well, that was fun.
[109:07.67]Now get me the fuck out of here.
[109:10.45]What's my escape route to get out of this place?
[109:17.01]My reward was the shovel.
[109:18.59]Where's the forge?
[109:24.18]Um... I don't think I'm... Do I need to go back this way?
[109:37.01]I'm in the fucking monster mouth maze.
[109:49.14]No, no, this is back up here.
[109:50.40]Oh, bye.
[109:53.33]He just pulled me up.
[109:57.05]Go down.
[110:00.25]Hi.
[110:21.96]shot up his ass.
[110:24.57]You idiot.
[110:34.44]What happens if I'm on the ladder?
[110:36.58]Yeah, he won't come down.
[110:39.48]Alright, what if I make the ladder slippery?
[110:43.90]Can I do that?
[110:49.09]The spell's not ready.
[110:50.73]What the fuck?
[110:53.39]I want to use the spell.
[111:00.13]Ah, that doesn't work.
[111:03.14]Well, get out of the way.
[111:05.86]I gotta move these fucking guys out of the way.
[111:08.66]This is very important, guys.
[111:10.04]You know it is.
[111:19.46]Okay.
[111:20.06]Come on down.
[111:24.54]I think he went that way.
[111:27.52]What?
[111:29.07]No fucking way.
[111:32.71]The fucking game crashed.
[111:43.36]Jesus Christ.
[111:55.66]I can't even close the window now.
[111:57.70]There we go.
[111:59.22]It's crashing over and over again.
[112:01.02]It keeps saying it stops responding and we're trying to find a solution.
[112:05.74]Here it comes.
[112:07.66]You think we're done with this game?
[112:08.62]We're not even close to being done with this game.
[112:11.50]Oh fuck, I'm so sorry.
[112:12.47]That was loud as hell.
[112:14.27]Oh my god.
[112:21.05]Where were we?
[112:23.12]Dead Man's Trail.
[112:24.02]Oh, shit.
[112:26.66]I think that was a while ago.
[112:36.57]God fucking damn it.
[112:47.03]God damn it.
[112:57.88]Okay, well, that's fucking fantastic.
[113:00.98]We gotta do that whole thing again.
[113:08.72]Turn this shit off.
[113:10.15]Oh my god, and I'm like, I can't even... Give me a fucking break.
[113:17.09]I'm fucking mad right now.
[113:21.95]I'm just speedrunning this.
[113:22.96]I'm just running to go get the katana.
[113:27.05]I don't care about any of these guys.
[113:28.19]I don't... Wait a minute.
[113:29.05]Shovel.
[113:30.37]Is that a shovel?
[113:31.69]Even better.
[113:32.03]It's a pickaxe.
[113:34.55]Even fucking better.
[113:39.73]What happened?
[113:40.25]What... What the fuck did you guys do?
[113:47.96]Go.
[113:53.56]That's... That's interesting.
[113:54.82]Wait, did I... Did I come this way already?
[114:00.96]No, no, no, I didn't.
[114:01.66]This is where I have to go.
[114:03.70]Katana's in here.
[114:04.52]I'm just gonna grab this shit.
[114:09.43]Grab the guy's like... Get the fuck out of here.
[114:15.17]I'm gonna hit him with the fucking mushroom spikes.
[114:24.82]Did I get the thing I wanted?
[114:25.90]Fucking murder that guy.
[114:31.00]Give me the knife.
[114:32.44]Give me the hand.
[114:33.10]Open this up.
[114:36.45]Now he's in the fucking way.
[114:37.31]Get out of the way.
[114:41.25]It folded that guy fucking accordion.
[114:44.35]Shovel.
[114:44.75]We got the shovel.
[114:45.55]We're good.
[114:45.95]Just gonna make our way over here.
[114:53.10]Where was the... Did I already get the katana and everything?
[114:55.44]What was that?
[114:58.80]Combat staff.
[115:01.80]Do I have the katana?
[115:04.35]No, it's in, like, the other room.
[115:05.17]Shovel's right there.
[115:05.79]We're fine.
[115:06.13]I don't remember where it was.
[115:11.45]It's, like, in one of the, like, doors.
[115:16.01]There it is.
[115:19.26]Can't use any of this shit to just get it all.
[115:21.30]Pick a fucking antidote in case I eat any fucking cheese nips.
[115:26.24]I gotta do some inventory management here.
[115:27.70]This is, like, a mess.
[115:31.51]Long sword is what I want.
[115:33.53]You get the... This is a joke.
[115:35.87]The fucking pickaxe is a joke.
[115:37.45]Right?
[115:37.69]Plus damage, +2.
[115:38.62]Wait.
[115:41.14]No.
[115:41.52]It's a joke.
[115:43.34]Hammer's a joke.
[115:44.98]This doesn't need to be up here.
[115:50.12]Anything else?
[115:50.62]Health potion and cures a poisonous wound.
[115:54.54]Okay.
[115:57.11]Saved.
[115:57.51]Let's go.
[116:02.49]Dermot likes cheese nibs.
[116:04.57]Well, sometimes you have to eat a cheese nib.
[116:06.74]Every once in a while.
[116:09.00]Okay, we're good there.
[116:10.74]I don't need to do anything in the forge.
[116:14.58]Nothing else is down here, right?
[116:19.33]Nothing else down here?
[116:20.41]Or is there something down here that I missed?
[116:26.57]I'm so paranoid about saving this game now.
[116:34.93]Where the fuck am I going?
[116:36.01]This is where those guys died.
[116:41.01]Unless I missed something all the way down here.
[116:42.59]This is like a fucking million ways to go.
[116:49.10]I didn't go this way.
[116:51.60]There's a warning here.
[116:53.76]Pay attention to when you open the cells.
[116:55.38]The villagers keep trying to escape.
[116:59.48]Okay.
[116:59.68]Okay.
[117:09.18]I got like night vision on.
[117:11.77]I'm like floating right now.
[117:13.77]I'm like sneaking around floating into this place.
[117:18.89]Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
[117:29.38]Can I get him?
[117:31.60]Create a diversion.
[117:32.36]Remember that walking reduces the sound of your footsteps.
[117:34.14]It says alt to walk.
[117:41.00]What?
[117:44.27]Am I walking?
[117:47.51]Shut up.
[117:49.05]Shut up.
[117:49.71]Okay, I'm going to make a diversion.
[117:52.47]I'm going to make a diversion.
[117:53.77]Alright, come on.
[118:11.79]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[118:24.22]This is important.
[118:25.74]Get the fuck out of my way.
[118:28.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[118:32.48]We gotta load this.
[118:35.21]Where's my quicksave?
[118:38.33]I wanna put this underneath the fucking bad magician.
[118:45.22]What can you do to draw their attention?
[118:49.84]What can I do to draw their attention?
[118:52.12]Alright, be careful.
[118:55.24]Alright, let me see.
[118:59.73]His path is over there on the left.
[119:01.21]Okay, I see his path.
[119:08.81]I'll get it.
[119:12.14]It goes over there.
[119:13.06]Right there.
[119:14.60]Is that going to get it?
[119:16.12]I don't think that's enough.
[119:17.00]It might have to be a little bit further out.
[119:22.97]Oh, just like another few inches.
[119:24.79]Important work.
[119:30.07]Important work happening here.
[119:34.31]That should be it.
[119:35.42]Okay, let's open the cell.
[119:36.96]What's going on here?
[119:44.42]You bastard, fuck you.
[119:45.78]You can't walk over that.
[119:46.96]Oh shit.
[120:01.21]This is my fucking grandfather!
[120:05.47]Wrong place, wrong time, wrong target.
[120:08.79]Consider yourself squashed.
[120:13.31]Oh no, he squished me!
[120:17.03]The camera with the frog is apparently the main character.
[120:23.24]Alright, let's do it for real this time.
[120:29.36]What the fuck?
[120:33.29]I thought it was supposed to be an arrow.
[120:37.35]Alright, let's open the door.
[120:43.72]Open the cell.
[120:45.06]Sneak by.
[120:46.56]Grab the crystal and then fucking sprint.
[120:52.23]Where am I sprinting?
[120:52.95]Where am I going?
[120:53.41]Where's the exit?
[120:53.95]I gotta get the cell.
[120:56.59]Wait a minute.
[120:57.17]Telekinesis!
[120:57.91]Grab it.
[120:58.07]Got it.
[120:58.25]Got it, motherfucker.
[120:58.87]Got it, motherfucker.
[121:11.94]Where do I go?
[121:13.16]How do I get out?
[121:13.58]Where's the exit?
[121:17.64]Where's the exit?
[121:19.28]God fucking dammit, everything looks the same.
[121:21.03]Where's the exit?
[121:21.67]This way, back the way I came?
[121:24.99]Oh, shit.
[121:28.13]Up here.
[121:30.67]Alright, what do I do?
[121:36.06]Go back to the sewers and escape with the... Okay, just gotta escape.
[121:39.15]They've sealed the exit.
[121:40.49]Find the river.
[121:41.27]It's our only chance.
[121:42.23]Found the river.
[121:46.19]Telekinesis is a joke, in quotes.
[121:50.24]Well, I mean, it is.
[121:52.88]Cross the Sea of Blood.
[121:53.98]We did it!
[121:58.56]Sarath.
[122:00.06]Wake up.
[122:01.90]Easy there.
[122:03.80]What happened?
[122:05.15]What's the matter?
[122:05.99]Xana?
[122:07.25]What's going on?
[122:08.73]Who?
[122:09.94]Am I losing?
[122:10.32]So she's a bad guy, of course.
[122:11.06]I should have known.
[122:11.62]I didn't skip a cutscene.
[122:38.75]Come find me.
[122:40.63]Come get me.
[122:41.51]Come in the water.
[122:42.72]It's fun.
[122:43.02]I didn't find... Stop walking.
[122:44.28]What's this fucking noise?
[122:45.28]What is this noise?
[122:46.38]What's this noise?
[122:47.74]Oh, it's a fucking bug.
[123:06.08]Now she starts fucking walking.
[123:10.16]God damn it.
[123:10.70]I'm not losing that fucking mana.
[123:12.42]No way.
[123:27.37]I'm not losing mana for no reason.
[123:29.41]It doesn't even work.
[123:32.11]Doesn't even work.
[123:33.03]Doesn't work.
[123:33.53]Okay, let's go.
[123:35.17]I tried it.
[123:36.29]I tried it again.
[123:37.73]I had to.
[123:38.01]Let's go.
[123:54.72]How do you get out?
[123:55.40]Do I have to jump over this?
[123:56.86]What was she doing to this guy?
[124:01.81]Who is this?
[124:02.27]This guy's alive.
[124:03.03]Oh, god damn it.
[124:18.40]So he was talking Please tell her no just to see her reaction Yes, I took it back That was him talking We're here
[124:42.39]I don't understand.
[124:43.75]Who's Saren?
[124:44.31]Is that him or me?
[124:45.39]Ooh, telekinesis.
[125:05.05]I so badly wanted just to kick her right there.
[125:08.04]In fact, in case I get the urge.
[125:10.10]Yeah, you get what you deserve.
[125:19.63]You get what you deserve, in my opinion.
[125:21.13]You know what I'm saying?
[125:32.21]What's going on?
[125:33.05]Whoa, what?
[125:34.33]What is this coming from?
[125:35.49]This fucking, the arrows are spinning around in circles.
[125:42.04]That was a sentry arrow.
[125:49.34]I got hit by the fucking arrow blade.
[125:50.70]Okay.
[125:50.96]I guess I'll allow it.
[126:12.78]I don't think the direct approach is working.
[126:14.52]If we don't stay low, those things will murder us.
[126:18.06]God damn it.
[126:20.59]Get more ammunition for the ballista!
[126:23.91]Show some skill before I kill you.
[126:26.13]He's going to get hit by the ballista.
[126:27.79]Hit him.
[126:28.25]Come on.
[126:30.67]I want this guy to get shot by the ballista so bad.
[126:34.61]I'm willing to put myself in harm's way.
[126:43.05]Right there.
[126:44.27]Right up here.
[126:45.15]Right there.
[126:48.27]At what point?
[126:48.87]There it is.
[126:49.39]Here it comes.

[127:03.28]Fucking God.
[127:04.04]Okay, let's just go.
[127:07.22]No more jokes.
[127:11.70]It seems as though Menelag's taste for luxury extended to his ship.
[127:22.97]I messed it.
[127:23.79]I messed it.
[127:24.65]I messed it.
[127:26.29]God damn it.
[127:27.33]I have to see that.
[127:34.81]It seems as though Menelag's taste for luxury extended to his ship.
[127:43.61]I fucking missed the joke and I spent all the time to get ready for it.
[127:50.57]Just fucking get out of here, you statue tin man fucking asshole.
[127:54.21]I'm done.
[127:54.85]I'm done with you.
[127:56.25]Joke's over.
[127:56.81]I don't want to... Let's go.
[128:08.03]Oh my god.
[128:10.59]No, no, no, no, not again.
[128:12.19]Oh my...
[128:19.98]Did he just jump in and die?
[128:22.00]Oh no, that's the guy that was already dead.
[128:24.20]Okay.
[128:24.48]I win.
[128:24.74]I won.
[128:26.12]No, where's the entrance?
[128:50.56]Which way do I go?
[128:52.18]Left side?
[128:52.62]Right side?
[128:53.54]I can go any way I want.
[128:56.42]Hopefully there's no sea animals.
[129:03.00]There it is.
[129:05.48]Found my entrance.
[129:07.60]Problem solved.
[129:08.32]Crisis averted.
[129:14.79]Oh, come on.
[129:15.37]What?
[129:16.79]What's this here for?
[129:19.35]Like, there's no, like, hookshot?
[129:32.80]Fuck.
[129:36.04]I'm still playing Lethal Enforcers.
[129:39.86]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[129:41.08]I can do telekinesis, can't I?
[129:45.98]Let's see.
[129:46.30]Let's try it.
[129:55.61]I can't, like, grab this and pull it down?
[129:56.95]What kind of video game is this?
[130:10.11]Just no clip into the boat that'd be so fucking stupid I don't want to drown so we're not doing that I have to do this shit.
[130:28.83]Okay.
[130:29.07]I have to get up there.
[130:29.75]Oh
[130:39.40]You know, you can get on the ladder too.
[130:43.26]Save it.
[130:50.97]Go.
[130:51.09]No, go.
[130:51.75]Go.
[130:51.95]Go forward.
[131:10.34]Come on.
[131:11.08]Go.
[131:12.50]Go that way.
[131:15.72]Easy, easy.
[131:17.30]Right in the window.
[131:17.96]Almost there.
[131:19.18]No, other way.
[131:19.88]Come on.
[131:24.88]Come on, quickly.
[131:26.08]Made it.
[131:29.84]Shit, I fucking...
[131:43.15]Yeah, how can you do that?
[131:44.45]You know, yeah, I don't think I you can't just fall the game fucking crashed I can't use Ice on anyone because the game will fucking break if I do so we can't fucking use ice on ladders anymore That's why this keeps happening There's a specific example where if I use ice on the ground near a ladder the game doesn't feel like working So we're kind of we're gonna not we're gonna prevent we're not gonna do that anymore.
[132:10.33]We just ain't gonna do that.
[132:11.19]I
[132:14.22]Okay.
[132:15.42]Back in the game we go.
[132:18.93]It's crashed three times.
[132:20.71]In a row.
[132:22.33]Close it.
[132:25.25]Oh, if I could speak another language, I would just start talking that other language right now.
[132:30.24]You know when somebody gets really angry at something and just starts talking the other language?
[132:34.22]I wish I could do that shit.
[132:35.34]Okay, anyways.
[132:36.22]Very loud.
[132:36.86]Turn your fucking volume down.
[132:38.00]Here's your warning.
[132:38.60]Turn it down.
[132:47.26]Okay.
[132:48.76]So, um, you guys know what I'm talking about?
[132:51.38]Like, let's say you got, like, a Spanish, and they speak perfectly fluent English.
[132:57.20]They speak perfectly fluent Spanish.
[132:59.36]And they'll be talking normally.
[133:00.64]They'll be like, oh, yeah, so I went to the store the other day, and I found, oh, adios, and then they just start, like, fucking talking, like, in Spanish.
[133:08.87]I wish I could do that.
[133:13.91]They just like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[133:15.39]They just start like saying like, I want to do that.
[133:17.47]I wish I could do that.
[133:19.15]Careful now.
[133:20.37]These are tight quarters for fighting.
[133:22.63]We're obviously going to cut this and drop it on his head, right?
[133:25.35]That's what this is.
[133:26.13]The rope is there for a reason.
[133:27.93]It's right there.
[133:29.61]He's standing there.
[133:30.37]This is just, this is what the game wants me to do.
[133:33.79]Holy fucking shit.
[133:35.01]That guy exploded.
[133:37.27]Oh my God.
[133:42.79]Okay, so people can explode in this game.
[133:53.83]Anything else?
[133:55.22]I'm gonna burn these guys alive like fried fucking eggs.
[134:06.44]Cook ribs.
[134:07.52]Nice.
[134:07.78]Who keeps ribs in boxes like this?
[134:11.59]Hey, Jerry, make sure you, like, store those ribs.
[134:13.81]You alright?
[134:22.18]You're gonna be fine.
[134:23.38]Oh, come on.
[134:39.81]Fine, I'll kill you like a normal video game.
[134:45.67]I will treat you like a video game.
[134:51.55]Missed block.
[134:57.10]Dead?
[135:01.78]Now he is.
[135:04.06]Simple key.
[135:06.95]Excellent.
[135:08.99]Daggers.
[135:12.43]Birds of a feather block together.
[135:17.32]I do love that they say they need backup.
[135:19.68]Like we're in medieval times.
[135:21.50]Why are they acting like they're on a radio?
[135:24.64]Need backup.
[135:28.80]Spikes everywhere.
[135:31.22]Almost got the fly.
[135:32.03]I just barely missed him.
[135:32.97]Now he's pissed.
[135:37.95]Why do they make games like this anymore, by the way?
[135:41.71]This game's fun.
[135:42.35]They don't make them like this anymore.
[135:46.63]When was the last time they made a game like this?
[135:48.63]I bet you can't even tell me.
[135:50.47]I went all the way around.
[135:51.73]Where's the key that I need to use?
[135:58.03]Like, is there another place to go?
[135:59.49]Or have I lost my mind entirely?
[136:01.95]I think it's right here.
[136:03.83]No, it's not.
[136:05.17]Right here.
[136:06.44]There it is.
[136:11.09]What was that?
[136:12.71]Oh, an oil jar?
[136:15.65]What does it want me to grab here?
[136:22.03]Bottle of the... What is this fucking... What is this?
[136:24.13]What do you want?
[136:24.51]I don't even know what I grabbed.
[136:25.55]What did I just pick up?
[136:28.03]Poison crisp.
[136:29.77]I'm gonna get the weapon map.
[136:30.61]What did I pick up?
[136:33.63]I don't know.
[136:35.41]But we got some points.
[136:38.20]Fire trap.
[136:41.90]Do charm.
[136:44.52]What do I need to use this critical hit?
[136:46.38]One.
[136:47.66]Stealth.
[136:48.13]Hold on.
[136:50.31]I'm doing this.
[136:53.75]Press alt to use your skill and move silently.
[136:55.73]Be careful as walking on some sound sensitive surfaces like metal may create some noise.
[136:59.13]Okay.
[136:59.79]What about level two?
[137:01.51]I can backstab?
[137:05.10]I want it.
[137:06.56]I'm using the daggers.
[137:07.20]I don't even care.
[137:10.44]We're playing... This is a fucking stealth playthrough now.
[137:18.18]What was I doing?
[137:19.83]I forget.
[137:20.13]Yeah, whatever.
[137:21.45]It don't matter.
[137:23.11]None of this matters.
[137:26.63]Don't worry.
[137:26.93]Fucking none of this shit matters.
[137:29.21]Now we have backstab capability.
[137:30.75]Nothing matters anymore.
[137:31.49]Alright, so what is it?
[137:34.03]Pick up the meat.
[137:34.91]Now, alt.
[137:38.66]Apparently, alt is how I sneak.
[137:43.73]Oh!
[137:46.15]God damn.
[137:50.03]Let's stealth kill this guy.
[137:56.88]Nice stealth kill.
[138:03.40]I can still stealth kill him.
[138:09.80]I can still get him with a stealth kill, don't worry.
[138:27.56]Come on.
[138:29.74]Stealth.
[138:30.92]Stealth killed him.
[138:36.94]The ultimate in stealth killing.
[138:39.34]Alright, you want to be fucking magician versus magician?
[138:41.14]I don't think you want to do that, buddy.
[138:46.42]What a fucking little bastard.
[138:50.00]What a little bastard.
[138:51.38]We're good.
[139:02.56]I do want to see how cool it is, though.
[139:04.28]So it's alt and then holding and then you do a power strike.
[139:07.52]When you're right behind them.
[139:08.22]I feel like I'm not going to be able to get that close to somebody in this game.
[139:14.89]Can I do that?
[139:15.55]Okay.
[139:22.37]There's that guy.
[139:22.95]He's currently beating a prisoner.
[139:24.95]How many guys have we got?
[139:29.24]Shut up.
[139:29.60]Free me!
[139:35.61]Okay.
[139:36.87]Uh, I can't- God damn it.
[139:42.03]You wanna play fucking finger poke?
[139:48.59]Fuck you, I just did a- I just did a Darth Vader potion.
[139:50.69]Don't have enough mana.
[140:07.66]I actually am in trouble right now.
[140:13.62]It's so dark.
[140:26.23]I'm getting stuck on a box.
[140:28.81]Where is he?
[140:37.98]Just don't fucking even use weapons.
[140:40.93]I'm just going to play use with the fucking portal cube and win.
[140:49.89]Can I just equip this forever?
[140:51.17]Honest to God.
[140:55.41]Let me just use this for the rest of the game.
[140:56.59]I can't open it.
[141:10.05]Anything else?
[141:11.33]No.
[141:13.27]Let's open the gates.
[141:18.47]Get to the loot.
[141:20.75]A bottle of berry juice.
[141:22.17]That's not a switch.
[141:23.09]I thought it was.
[141:23.89]There is a long sword, some bones, baked bread, somebody's skull.
[141:34.18]Where did it go?
[141:34.66]Okay, well, it's gone now, wherever it is.
[141:40.83]Alright, let's open up the gate.
[141:42.91]I don't know where... How do I open it, though?
[141:50.97]These scrolls.
[141:51.75]Does anybody have, like, a key?
[141:55.45]Somebody has a key on them?
[141:57.25]I like the hook.
[141:58.03]There we go.
[141:58.39]I'll get a key.
[142:01.26]Okay.
[142:02.68]Come on out.
[142:05.64]Wait, this... I don't want to let this guy out.
[142:07.00]I want to let the other guy out.
[142:15.17]Here we go.

[142:20.19]That key was not... There it is.
[142:22.21]Come out and give me your friendship.
[142:28.58]Is the guy like a companion?
[142:29.80]I got companions now?
[142:33.84]Oh, this is awesome.
[142:34.56]I actually have companions.
[142:41.03]I got a bunch of friends.
[142:42.73]This is awesome.
[142:43.65]So where do I go with my friends?
[142:48.54]Oh, fuck.
[142:49.50]It's probably a bad idea.
[142:53.92]I guess we're leaving.
[142:56.38]We got our tooth goblin army.
[143:07.07]I just... I just needed to see what it did!
[143:12.09]Oh, god damn it.

[156:42.98]Where'd the goblins go?
[156:43.94]I'm like... Explain it.
[156:57.38]I'm all ears as to find out how the fuck that happened.

[157:50.52]Oh, here they go.
[157:52.66]Here we go.
[157:58.60]He's running away.
[157:59.38]He didn't die from that.
[158:10.85]He was going for the broom.
[158:11.79]I had to do it.
[158:14.58]Finished him with a fucking broom.
[158:19.40]What an epic battle.
[158:32.19]How are you?
[158:33.97]Yeah.
[158:35.71]Almost.
[158:41.43]You came fairly close.
[158:43.62]You're almost there.
[158:44.82]If you work really hard for it, you might be able to do it.
[158:47.02]Okay, so let me go to my skills.
[158:53.44]Sanctuary.
[158:54.26]This is just a big shield.
[158:55.78]Oh, we got lightning bolt.
[158:56.90]I don't care what the other ones are.
[158:59.56]We got lightning bolt now.
[159:13.18]What about a staff?
[159:17.73]Damage +2.
[159:20.25]Staves are slow weapons that don't inflict much damage, but are perfect for fighting against a pack of enemies.
[159:24.31]They can usually stun or knock down as they hit.
[159:26.83]Whatever.
[159:28.34]We got zap.
[159:33.14]Chain lightning bounces off walls.
[159:35.64]Deals electrical damage.
[159:36.74]Cool.
[159:39.28]I gotta get rid of some of this shit.
[159:40.51]I have too many things.
[159:42.15]Blow the gangway to the dock.
[159:44.83]And let me just take a look.
[159:48.59]Magic.
[159:48.95]I'm gonna do more of this.
[159:53.38]Max mana.
[159:55.02]Cool.
[159:57.50]Strength that up.
[160:00.98]Give us a heal.
[160:01.62]I wanna see what a lightning bolt looks like.
[160:06.37]Dude, this is just like fucking BioShock.
[160:08.83]I love it.
[160:10.67]I gotta put my sword back up here.
[160:15.23]Adds plus one damage.
[160:16.91]No, I like the mana.
[160:20.87]I got armor.
[160:22.92]Ooh, that's cool.
[160:26.08]Adds plus ten mana.
[160:26.96]Requires magic affinity one.
[160:28.18]Good.
[160:28.40]Okay, well I now have the wizard robe zone.
[160:31.48]I gotta lower the thing.
[160:35.08]Lower the thing.
[160:45.49]Where's the thing?
[160:47.11]Somewhere up here.
[160:48.97]Drop door?
[160:49.39]I can't open it.
[160:53.05]Don't worry, I accidentally saved.
[161:00.50]There we go.
[161:04.12]All aboard!
[161:10.58]Lena's health now appears.
[161:11.56]Oh, she's getting chased.
[161:23.50]God damn it.
[161:25.84]Okay.
[161:26.48]Okay.
[161:27.90]Okay.
[161:34.92]Okay.
[161:35.26]We're good.
[161:36.66]We're good.
[161:37.24]We did what we wanted to do.
[161:41.92]It's alright.
[161:42.34]Don't even work on her anyways.
[161:44.38]Okay.
[161:54.35]I love this game.
[161:55.17]It's too good.
[161:57.29]It's too good.
[161:59.53]Wait, hold on.
[162:00.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[162:01.17]Can I?
[162:01.81]No.
[162:02.17]No, it's not worth it.
[162:03.97]It ain't worth it.
[162:05.13]Just get out of the way so I can get rid of this guy.
[162:07.71]What?
[162:08.09]What the f- I thought she was getting chased.
[162:11.12]I thought she was getting chased by a fucking evil sorcerer.
[162:16.20]Ugh.
[162:18.02]Look at- She's being- This guy is chasing her right now, right?
[162:20.98]I thought that- Oh, her health was in the top left corner.
[162:26.89]I thought this was a fucking bad guy.
[162:28.81]I'll free the crew and get the ship ready to sail.
[162:30.81]Just keep those monsters from getting on board.
[162:32.86]Okay, keep the monsters from getting on board.
[162:35.50]This is gonna be real easy.
[162:36.44]Showing off for the other pretty girl, are we?
[162:40.14]I'm just gonna freeze the ship.
[162:41.86]And no one's gonna do anything.
[162:44.62]Keep the black guards off the boat.
[162:47.08]Okay.
[162:47.98]I'll get us moving if you keep them off the ship.
[162:50.27]Guard the gangplank.
[162:50.77]It's the easiest thing you've told me to do all day.
[162:53.51]They're coming!
[162:54.47]Zareth, stop them!
[162:58.72]What are you doing?
[163:00.42]Get the fuck out of the way.
[163:02.26]What are you thinking?
[163:03.82]You just got hit in the head by an arrow.
[163:05.92]You got hit in the fucking face by an arrow.
[163:08.48]Move out of the way.
[163:15.43]What?
[163:15.97]Why is she doing this?
[163:19.01]She's just getting hit in the fucking head by arrows.
[163:23.72]You think that you would get out of the way.
[163:27.58]No, I can just Lightning Bolt this guy.
[163:29.06]Got him.
[163:33.18]Anybody else have any projectiles?
[163:35.66]This guy back there?
[163:36.58]Easy.
[163:36.72]You guys are fucking pathetic.
[163:56.06]See ya.
[163:57.16]That guy's trying to get away.
[163:58.38]We don't fucking let people escape.
[163:59.82]Are you fucking serious, dude?
[164:11.21]I ran out of fucking stamina.
[164:12.21]Never mind.
[164:12.55]Joke's ruined.
[164:13.07]I ran out of stamina.
[164:20.00]I ran out of mana.
[164:28.96]Okay, apparently.
[164:30.48]That's how that works.
[164:34.68]Hey, remember that guy that I was so concerned about?
[164:36.54]There he is.
[164:38.83]He's so dead.
[164:42.07]Just wait until he gets over here.
[164:43.07]Do I have any... I do have mana potions.
[164:50.85]What?
[164:53.55]What is hitting her?
[164:56.24]It's so easy.
[164:58.10]Something flew off of him.
[165:00.84]Meet your dragon.
[165:02.38]He's so slowly coming up here.
[165:04.26]Eventually, I'm going to make it.
[165:06.09]And I'm going to make my captain proud.
[165:08.37]Just you wait for me.
[165:25.48]I'm scared to attack because... What?
[165:31.77]I don't want to fucking hit her accidentally.
[165:43.12]Come on, you fucking asshole.
[165:45.80]Come on!
[165:47.98]Holy shit.
[165:50.14]One of these is gonna fucking hit him.
[165:51.93]Are these homing missiles?
[165:55.73]I'm so confused.
[165:56.65]I don't like the Zap, man.
[166:02.72]Zap kind of sucks.
[166:09.10]You good?
[166:12.60]Thanks for the heal.
[166:15.96]This is, uh... We're in kind of, like, one-by-one territory right now.
[166:27.26]You think they would have figured it out by now?
[166:29.46]I keep thinking that guy's a fucking bad guy.
[166:31.10]I saved, don't worry.
[166:32.98]I got it.
[166:33.80]I saved it.
[166:34.36]I didn't even move.
[166:35.34]Okay, we're good.
[166:52.28]Good joke.
[166:52.72]Take care of the crew.
[166:53.42]Okay.
[166:53.88]No, no, no, no.
[166:54.38]Okay, good.
[166:54.64]Is he climbing this?
[167:18.60]Oh, I thought I was gonna climb up that.
[167:20.22]I was supposed to say, holy shit, man, you're insane.
[167:23.07]I'm sure I'm gonna slide.
[167:26.27]Sliding would be so much fun.
[167:30.70]Press the button.
[167:31.16]Why is she holding the door closed?
[167:33.30]This voice in my head.
[167:35.18]We missed the fucking cutscene.
[167:36.52]Thank you, everybody that's... Oh, I'm yawning.
[167:39.34]Fuck.
[168:00.42]Everybody, thank you so much for giving the bits and the subs.
[168:02.61]I just... Alt-tabbing... Alt-tabbing is a bad move right now.
[168:10.27]So I can't really alt-tab to, um... See the notifications, unfortunately.
[168:15.45]So I'm sorry about that.
[168:21.33]Alright, interesting cutscene.
[168:28.62]Alrighty.
[168:30.31]I'm having a lot of fun with this game.
[168:31.75]Loud.
[168:32.03]You dance divinely, Lord Arantir.
[168:34.53]We are all part of a much greater dance, my dear.
[168:38.21]I've simply performed the steps for longer than most.
[168:43.08]Well, well, look who's here.
[168:45.16]So good of you to join us.
[168:47.74]Do you want to learn about your destiny or your doom?
[168:51.60]Neither are what you think.
[168:53.22]He'll learn soon enough.
[168:55.03]Go on, Leon.
[168:55.99]Dance with him for as long as he'll allow it.
[169:06.33]It's inevitable.
[169:08.71]It's fate.
[169:12.70]Ah, your first victim.
[169:14.66]Don't worry, boy.
[169:15.84]She will be your last.
[169:17.04]So did that really happen?
[169:21.46]Or what?
[169:25.14]Was that a bad dream?
[169:27.31]So this is the island of the temple.
[169:29.54]Yes, sir.
[169:31.14]You better believe I just was trying to kick him off.
[169:34.32]Every chance I get, this guy's going right into the fucking water.
[169:36.87]The island is full of hostile orc warriors.
[169:39.09]Goblins, too.
[169:39.63]I'm spamming the kick button.
[169:41.73]The second I stand up, this guy's going over.
[169:43.73]Their hate is justified.
[169:45.33]Wizards created orcs for shock troops during the War of the Blood Moon, fusing demon blood with human flesh.
[169:51.69]They won't take kindly to her presence.
[169:54.77]Speech looks clear of orcs, milady.
[169:59.65]Yeah.
[170:00.99]What the fuck?
[170:04.59]That's that guy twice.
[170:05.45]That's this guy twice.
[170:06.77]It's the same person.
[170:11.99]What happened?
[170:21.54]Okay, they don't care about this one.
[170:22.70]They don't care about this one.
[170:23.40]This one doesn't exist.
[170:24.04]What?
[170:35.00]Is that gonna happen again That was the real one fuck so where's the fake one Okay, there is
[171:04.17]That's, that, that, which one's the fake one?
[171:12.54]These guys are both not supposed to be here.
[171:14.74]That's not the real one.
[171:18.28]That guy walked out of the water.
[171:19.44]There's no way one of these guys is supposed to be here.
[171:21.50]I refuse to believe it.
[171:26.18]Which one's not moving?
[171:27.58]Okay, this one's not moving.
[171:29.38]So he must be the fucking imposter.
[171:34.22]I don't know I get maybe I think that I was trying to mercy kill him I was trying to mercy kill him
[171:58.48]Fucking clones.
[171:59.30]I got my eye on you, clone.
[172:00.86]Oh, there he is again.
[172:01.72]I got orcs now.
[172:27.86]I see shit on the ground.
[172:39.27]That was a very large jump for a tiny little thing.
[172:42.57]Press E alternatively on Liena to tell her to stand still or follow you.
[172:49.28]Okay, so how do I get her to stand still?
[172:59.18]Okay, now she's following me.
[173:04.33]We went this way, not that way.
[173:05.57]Oh, that would have been fucking perfect if you guys saw that shit if I did it.
[173:24.93]Imagine how much respect I would command.
[173:45.39]No, it just lets go by itself.
[173:46.57]Okay.
[173:49.37]Oh, die!
[173:55.64]Oh, he got into the spikes.
[174:04.99]Spikes!
[174:07.41]He didn't get into the spikes.
[174:11.13]No, he did.
[174:11.53]Shit head.
[174:16.48]Oh, scroll to freeze.
[174:21.80]Where are you going?
[174:25.05]I caught him in that one, though.
[174:33.29]Honestly, I keep thinking that those birds are projectiles.
[174:36.50]I hope he doesn't kill me.
[174:46.89]There's a lot of fucking people here.
[174:48.49]Holy shit, his leg is gone.
[174:55.92]I gotta power move this guy.
[175:04.76]Come on, die!
[175:07.42]Finally.
[175:07.81]Alright, I need the girl to heal.
[175:12.09]Come heal me.
[175:13.45]I require healing.
[175:15.93]Thank you.
[175:20.48]Let's do a chain lightning here.
[175:22.52]I don't have enough mana.
[175:24.10]They're all just going for her.
[175:27.52]I can't touch her.
[175:28.18]Fucking die!
[175:35.26]Oh, he's going for the fucking priest.
[175:52.45]Alright, he's dead.
[175:56.79]Let's get this dude.
[175:59.33]Oh, that would have been fucking cool.
[176:02.76]Don't miss.
[176:03.34]I don't know why I keep taking that out.
[176:20.83]It's fucking meaningless.
[176:23.37]Oh, I was about to kick her in the fucking chest.
[176:28.95]Is this related to the Might and Magic games?
[176:30.39]Yes, it is.
[176:35.63]It is part of the series.
[176:38.29]I want more mana.
[176:41.77]More mana?
[176:42.14]I need Endurance, too.
[176:43.28]I don't know.
[176:45.58]Where are my potions?
[176:47.72]Can't equip any of this shit, so we're gonna move...
[176:52.95]Mushroom up there.
[176:56.59]Hook.
[177:00.61]What's this?
[177:03.15]Damage plus three.
[177:04.65]Damage plus three.
[177:05.61]Melee combat one.
[177:06.58]Let's try the hook.
[177:08.90]Alright, this thing's actually awesome.
[177:11.00]It's a captain hook.
[177:12.70]I can pretend to be my favorite Peter Pan character.
[177:17.56]Tweet that I'm streaming?
[177:19.99]I did.
[177:22.72]The tweet didn't go through.
[177:23.68]I'm sorry about that, but I did tweet.
[177:25.46]They didn't just hear us?
[177:30.11]No more tunnels.
[177:30.55]Oh, God.
[177:30.69]Really?
[177:30.87]I gotta go find a tunnel.
[177:32.17]I don't want to go down there.
[177:33.53]Going down there is certain death.
[177:53.44]I think this is how Duncan got us in last time.
[177:55.28]Don't you get tired of running her errands?
[177:58.55]Oh, well, I guess this Liana is useful as long as she gets us to the Skull of Shadows.
[178:11.03]OK, we're good.
[178:14.35]There should be a way in over here.
[178:17.25]Ah, a lonely blast.
[178:18.82]We made it.
[178:19.38]Pulling.
[178:20.30]There must be a switch of some kind around here.
[178:22.44]What is this?
[178:25.91]You guys still down there?
[178:27.93]Send food!
[178:30.41]I want to pick this up, whatever it is.
[178:31.61]Maybe not.
[178:38.32]Are these scorpions or spiders?
[178:39.46]Do they attack?
[178:39.94]I don't think they attack.
[178:44.76]Yeah, they do.
[178:45.94]They have a lot of blood.
[178:47.62]Too much blood.
[178:48.22]Where is this?
[178:48.56]That one exploded too.
[178:57.58]What the fuck are these?
[179:01.69]What have we gotten into?
[179:03.53]What have we gotten into here?
[179:04.41]What in the name of God?
[179:14.99]This game, there's like orcs and shit.
[179:17.38]What did I just...
[179:28.76]electrocute these motherfuckers okay well that was kind of scary that was scary um where's my fucking plus three uh what am I not I'm not using any of that those projectiles
[180:01.24]I can't make that jump.
[180:05.68]Somewhere else to go down here?
[180:06.76]I guess.
[180:13.76]Where did I come from?
[180:14.46]I got so scared of those dumb fucking wasps.
[180:30.65]Down here.
[180:38.46]Can I hit those?
[180:38.98]Let's try hitting that.
[180:48.77]This could go very fucking poorly, so... I can't, like, break this?
[181:10.52]Alright.
[181:12.92]So that was a bust.
[181:26.94]Come here!
[181:27.76]Give me that board!
[181:32.54]Literally a goldfish.
[181:33.72]What are you talking about?
[181:35.86]What am I missing here?
[181:41.34]Build a ladder?
[181:45.94]What rope?
[181:47.36]There's a rope here?
[181:48.32]I don't see a fucking rope.
[181:55.65]I see like a cable and a piece of wood.
[182:11.70]Have I lost my fucking mind?
[182:16.90]I may have lost my fucking mind.
[182:18.06]I don't know what you guys are seeing.
[182:20.48]What are you seeing?
[182:21.19]I don't see anything.
[182:38.47]All I'm doing is waving.
[182:50.77]People are telling me to shoot like a rope with an arrow.
[182:58.43]Where is that?
[182:59.05]I see this.
[183:01.21]I haven't been in here before.
[183:04.91]I couldn't even fucking do it.
[183:21.20]I couldn't even do it, guys.
[183:22.64]You're giving me all this shit and I couldn't even do anything.
[183:24.60]I'm gonna take it out on this guy.
[183:28.22]Alright.
[183:34.66]Okay.
[183:38.56]I think I need to... I need to put a point... into... like, bow and arrows, probably.
[183:47.44]I was gonna do one.
[183:49.95]Press R while using a bow to zoom in.
[183:51.33]Alright, rope bow.
[183:54.11]Spawns ropes when it hits a wooden surface.
[183:56.49]Okie dokie.
[184:04.43]It was all by myself.
[184:06.75]How was I supposed to know I was going to get a rope bow?
[184:10.99]I'm getting shit right now from people telling me, like, oh, how could you?
[184:13.36]I can't believe it.
[184:14.40]How did you know you were going to get a fucking rope bow?
[184:19.12]You know the thing that there's no way you would have known existed in the game?
[184:23.75]How can you not know that?
[184:25.77]That's remarkable!
[184:34.81]Lana told me in a dream?
[184:37.66]I wasn't paying attention to that fucking lady.
[184:41.08]At least I got a flashlight.
[184:49.29]So that was all that was down here.
[184:52.90]I can't, like, kick this.
[184:54.42]I telekinesis this.
[184:57.56]That's not telekinesis.
[184:58.98]That's the wrong button.
[185:01.78]No.
[185:04.88]Well, that was fun.
[185:08.71]Glad we went up there for nothing.
[185:14.07]Wait a minute.
[185:14.45]I am one of those priests.
[185:18.03]This is a secret area.
[185:23.39]What the fuck was that?
[185:26.07]Bomb bow?
[185:29.93]Missed the lore.
[185:30.76]Oh, whatever.
[185:36.98]So there's two ways to go here.
[185:39.80]Can I rope bow something?
[185:41.96]Let me fucking rope bow.
[185:54.89]Where is this?
[185:56.13]Rope bow.
[185:57.55]There it is.
[186:05.69]Oh, God.
[186:06.46]It's an arrow bow.
[186:13.98]Get to win the game, bow.
[186:18.61]We did it.
[186:25.75]Holy shit, it's a dragon.
[186:28.45]Oh my god.
[186:30.83]Whoa.
[186:36.54]Oh, that guy's dead.
[186:37.32]That guy's dead.
[186:42.36]Eat this, motherfucker.
[186:47.46]You spit lightning while I spit oil canisters.
[186:51.85]No, Leanna's dead.
[186:55.78]Skyrim is here to save you.
[187:05.69]I got him.
[187:06.92]I hit him with the fucking box.
[187:13.46]He just hit me instead of him.
[187:15.44]This guy's still alive.
[187:16.87]I just took that hit from...
[187:24.79]That actually worked.
[187:27.29]I hit him right in the face.
[187:28.09]Damn it!
[187:30.51]Damn it!
[187:31.02]I'm gonna find shelter.
[188:04.97]Are you seriously in here fighting right now when there's a dragon outside?
[188:07.39]And I'm dead.
[188:12.69]Rope the dragon.
[188:13.51]I'm trying to kill the dragon with a box.
[188:23.70]I'll get it.
[188:24.04]Got him.
[188:27.04]Got him right in the fucking head.
[188:30.53]Alright, time to go.
[188:33.31]That guy's fucking... Who cares?
[188:46.24]Don't die.
[188:50.60]What?
[188:50.72]What is this?
[188:51.30]Why do I have a fucking mug in my hand?
[188:58.62]Don't go out there.
[188:59.56]Do not go outside.
[189:00.48]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[189:01.80]Ah, this fucking stamina thing.
[189:08.29]Die.
[189:08.67]Do I have any stamina potions like Diablo fucking 2?
[189:16.49]Seriously.
[189:18.61]He's dead.
[189:19.27]That guy exploded.
[189:26.31]I don't think I can block with this thing on.
[189:28.09]That was close.
[189:36.47]Okay, now what?
[189:37.86]Continue.
[189:38.26]Force strength, force dam, leather about.
[189:40.98]Oh, man.
[189:43.42]Force strength, force dam, leather about.
[190:06.73]And we're going to make him go right into the fire.
[190:10.14]Stop the fires.
[190:12.74]Oh, easy, boys.
[190:13.76]Don't fall into the flames.
[190:17.54]He's still alive.
[190:21.04]Oh, whoopsie.
[190:22.37]Oh, almost got it.
[190:24.23]Almost had it there.
[190:25.69]Leanna's dead.
[190:26.41]Leanna, Leanna, Leanna, I'm making jokes.
[190:28.43]Where'd you go?
[190:32.47]Do a fucking Patronus quick.
[190:33.75]Save us.
[190:36.72]That's you.
[190:39.50]Follow you?
[190:40.38]Fine.
[190:45.06]Where are we going again?
[190:46.16]I was about to kick her into the spikes.
[190:55.55]I refrained from doing that.
[191:04.01]Lots of shiny stuff on this table.
[191:07.54]How did you die?
[191:08.24]See, that guy disappeared.
[191:15.92]We were being really respectful.
[191:22.65]I'm pushing my luck with that.
[191:24.71]Shovel.
[191:25.01]Where's the dragon?
[191:26.23]Who is she talking to?
[191:27.87]Is that good?
[191:40.95]Then I'm doubly glad that he is here.
[191:42.89]A worthy sword arm is always welcome.
[191:45.85]He's made out of magic.
[191:46.91]He's very worthy, Duncan.
[191:48.52]Don't we have a skull to find here?
[191:51.14]But enough chatter.
[191:52.22]Arantir will be on our heels.
[191:53.94]There are other boats in Stonehelm.
[191:55.92]Duncan, you defend the boat.
[191:58.32]Sarath and I will find the skull.
[192:00.12]We may have to leave quickly when we return.
[192:01.60]I have to pee really bad.
[192:03.36]As you wish.
[192:04.54]The blessings of Erasmus.
[192:06.21]I dropped it.
[192:06.83]I dropped it!
[192:07.39]I hit... I hit... I dropped it!
[192:09.65]I dropped it in front of him and it hurt him.
[192:14.01]I hit right click, I let go of it, and it fucking hurt him.
[192:17.55]And he got angry.
[192:18.80]Okay, let me drop it up here so nobody gets fucking hurt.
[192:20.82]Okay, I tried that time.
[192:22.90]Easy, girl.
[192:40.04]Get the anti-spider bow.
[192:47.00]If Lana doesn't like you, the mission's over.
[192:48.76]Into the altar room.
[192:50.00]Open the portcullis.
[193:04.15]Okay.
[193:04.61]Ring of Regeneration.
[193:06.81]What's that?
[193:09.57]I'm such a hoarder.
[193:11.73]Regenerates your health.
[193:12.93]Can I wear more than one ring?
[193:15.95]No.
[193:16.85]I gotta pee real bad, so give me one second.
[193:22.67]I'll be right back.
[193:25.19]Give me one second.
[193:27.51]I'll be right back.
[193:27.97]I gotta pee.
[193:29.35]I can't go BRB screen, so I have to just leave.
[193:32.87]I'll be back in a minute.
[193:36.01]Oh, nice.
[193:36.41]Fucking cheez-its.
[193:38.70]I forgot about these.
[193:41.08]Mmm.
[193:43.91]Fucking delicious.
[195:39.11]Oh, I'm gonna plug my phone in.
[195:45.13]Cause it is dead.
[195:46.99]Dead phone.
[195:48.01]Let's see if we can plug it in.
[195:48.87]Give me some of these fucking cheese slips.
[195:55.69]Mm.
[195:57.59]Mm mm mm, okay.
[195:59.48]What the fuck?
[196:00.28]Oh, I did that.
[196:02.08]I forgot.
[196:07.58]What's the uh?
[196:08.35]I think we need to get up there to get out.
[196:11.91]Get up where?
[196:12.75]Up here?
[196:13.05]Okay, easy.
[196:18.33]Don't forget that nice bow you found before.
[196:21.11]I know, that's what I'm doing.
[196:22.81]Any pieces of wood over there?
[196:26.94]There's wood over here.
[196:28.00]I think we need to get up there to get out.
[196:33.38]Easy.
[196:34.82]Those cheese nips are fucking pretty good.
[196:36.20]Pretty good poison.
[196:44.55]Yeah, pretty good poisonous fruit.
[196:52.99]Come out!
[197:02.90]She in here with me?
[197:06.04]Okay, let me see here.
[197:08.80]Oh, come on!
[197:33.49]Alright, he's dead.
[197:37.05]I like this fucking Luigi game.
[197:38.63]This is a pretty good Luigi video game, if you ask me.
[197:43.17]That's a skill point.
[197:44.55]Cheese it.
[197:45.37]That's a victory.
[197:45.97]Cheese it.
[197:51.46]Mm-hmm.
[197:52.06]Yeah, that's a victory.
[197:55.62]Cheese it.
[198:00.28]Here it is.
[198:01.66]Magnificent, isn't it?
[198:03.86]That's one word for it.
[198:05.21]I'm fucking hungry.
[198:06.21]Uncle said the Skull of Shadows is in the crypt beyond this gate.
[198:09.27]If you can place the crystal in the heart of the temple, I can open it.
[198:12.49]But it will take time.
[198:13.85]You're gonna say shit?
[198:14.41]You're gonna talk shit?
[198:16.51]God damn it.
[198:17.15]That corridor leads to the chamber where you can activate the crystal.
[198:20.98]I'm not even gonna let it tell me.
[198:26.62]That's one word for it.
[198:28.96]Uncle said the Skull of Shadows is in the crypt beyond this gate.
[198:32.38]There's a snake somewhere?
[198:33.36]Where?
[198:34.16]I can open it.
[198:35.24]But it will take time.
[198:36.56]There are all sorts of magical defenses here.
[198:38.70]Snake?
[198:38.98]What do you mean, snake?
[198:39.66]That corridor leads to the chamber where you can activate the crystal.
[198:43.72]Mm-hmm.
[198:44.18]The incantation will take a lot of preparation time.
[198:46.60]Mm-hmm.
[198:47.20]Hurry back.
[198:48.38]I don't want to be alone here too long.
[198:50.46]What?
[198:52.80]Which corridor?
[198:54.02]Like this one?
[198:54.62]The one that's blocked?
[198:57.54]Will you be safe here?
[199:02.76]Is this where she wants me to go?
[199:11.96]No.
[199:12.52]That'd be so funny if I could, like, steal it from her.
[199:17.90]Let's go.
[199:23.26]Any bad guys?
[199:23.96]I see a bad... I see a skeleton over there.
[199:26.00]That skeleton probably is, uh...
[199:33.35]What is dead?
[199:34.07]You know.
[199:34.99]What's that?
[199:35.71]Holy shit.
[199:37.89]Why was that just a weird color?
[199:39.33]That was weird.
[199:39.79]What does it want me to do with this?
[199:47.07]Hmm.
[199:50.31]Figured it out.
[199:53.76]Okay.
[199:55.04]Um.
[199:56.26]Lots of stuff in here.
[200:01.73]The inventory is full.
[200:02.41]In order to be able to pick up additional items, you need to get rid of some of your belongings.
[200:06.47]To do so, open your... I ate all the test subjects.
[200:21.04]Holy shit.
[200:27.00]I need these fucking antidotes.
[200:27.86]I don't think I even need them.
[200:30.45]Get this book out of here.
[200:34.88]I'm gonna use these up.
[200:39.10]Fire trap.
[200:40.63]Freeze.
[200:41.29]Like, I'm just gonna use these.
[200:50.01]Anyone who eats cheese nips can jump off a cliff.
[200:53.78]Handwritten note.
[200:54.56]Get this out of here.
[200:57.86]The mushrooms.
[200:58.34]I mean, but some of these... Like, these stupid... It's easy.
[201:04.61]These shields I don't need.
[201:05.81]Alright, that's good for now.
[201:18.26]Oh, I'm picking up pieces of his body.
[201:20.34]Alright, we're good.
[201:22.29]I'm gonna cast these spells.
[201:28.39]No one for me to go.
[201:33.91]okay okay oh got him what spell is this okay it's that one alright this thing sucks this thing kind of sucks oh that was brutal but this thing still is dumb
[202:07.90]Okay, I ultra killed that guy.
[202:13.56]That guy died a lot.
[202:15.14]I killed that goblin so bad his skin came off.
[202:22.76]Okay.
[202:25.55]That's another one.
[202:26.01]What is this one?
[202:27.57]Fire trap.
[202:29.59]Well, accidentally used this one.
[202:32.15]Hopefully I can keep going.
[202:35.43]I wouldn't want to be under that column when it falls.
[202:44.18]I'm just a flaming torch right now.
[202:52.24]Mmm, looking for the birds.
[202:54.59]Is that a battle axe?
[202:57.98]Don't forget, we may still have to kill that Powkai.
[203:01.51]Urgash knows how.
[203:03.59]I forgot that.
[203:04.95]We'll deal with it when the time comes.
[203:06.63]Can I just... Maybe I can just burn up to hell with my burn spells.
[203:11.21]I can use the axe.
[203:12.03]There's damage on this thing.
[203:15.13]+2.
[203:17.10]Plus three.
[203:18.96]Plus one.
[203:19.56]Plus three.
[203:25.01]Get this thing out of here.
[203:27.05]Get this thing out of here too.
[203:34.47]I like all these staffs and shit.
[203:36.33]I just don't know what's good and what's not good.
[203:42.01]Whatever.
[203:42.33]I'm gonna use the club.
[203:49.60]I have five bows for no reason.
[203:53.93]Actually, I don't need the archery bow or the elven bow.
[204:08.30]Term of the snake boy.
[204:09.32]This is gonna be easy.
[204:21.30]I can't parry with the club, so never mind.
[204:23.66]It sucks.
[204:26.22]That guy's burnt and he's still running.
[204:27.72]This guy's like burnt to a crisp and he's just running around before he dies.
[204:33.05]Wow, that was horrible.
[204:34.61]Let's be respectful of it, you know.
[204:35.95]Let's respect his body.
[204:38.75]Back in the fire, you fucking idiot.
[204:45.89]What else is in here?
[204:46.59]Ring of Might.
[204:57.30]Pick it up.
[204:57.80]There we go.
[204:59.46]The club sucks.
[205:03.16]Maybe I'll go back to the daggers.
[205:04.32]The hook is... The hook sucks, too, though.
[205:06.30]I want... I want to be able to fucking parry.
[205:09.96]I can't parry with this.
[205:10.98]Get it out of here.
[205:12.47]Get it out of here.
[205:14.83]Longsword.
[205:15.41]We're gonna go back to the longsword.
[205:16.47]I can at least fucking block.
[205:18.43]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[205:22.23]Alright.
[205:23.49]Let's peek down here.
[205:27.37]Whatever that does.
[205:28.03]Uh-oh.
[205:40.64]We're not trapped.
[205:42.74]We're actually in not a terrible spot.
[205:46.30]Was I supposed to be able to... Oh, yeah, we are trapped.
[205:54.38]Now what?
[205:56.82]Get on the wood?
[205:57.36]No, we're good.
[206:00.18]Go back and see Lana in the main... What do you mean, go back and see her in the main hall?
[206:07.50]You gonna tell me to do that shit now?
[206:09.02]Really?
[206:09.28]Why is this all fucked up?
[206:32.26]Rope both of birds.
[206:36.89]Alright, Leanna.
[206:38.93]What do you got for me?
[206:51.68]I opened up a shortcut, did I?
[206:53.40]Oh, I didn't even see it.
[206:54.16]It's alright, I'm like here anyways.
[207:01.46]Blue?
[207:01.92]Wood?
[207:03.92]Oh, whatever.
[207:06.28]It's too late.
[207:06.88]I already went the long way.
[207:13.81]I'm back.
[207:18.81]What am I sorry for?
[207:21.35]Why am I so slow?
[207:22.01]Uh...
[207:30.45]Because sometimes when I turn my head to look at the other monitor while I'm playing the video game, I don't see some things that are on the other screen.
[207:39.56]And... I'm eating fucking Cheez-Its and shit.
[207:43.38]Because that was really close.
[207:47.95]That was actually close to hitting me.
[208:00.43]I don't know where he is.
[208:02.07]Where is he?
[208:03.41]What happened?
[208:03.99]Is everything okay?
[208:09.79]Oh, it's a dragon!
[208:10.89]Alright.
[208:18.50]Let's do some moves here.
[208:24.75]What?
[208:26.59]What am I doing?
[208:32.29]Alright, I was just eating some cheeses.
[208:40.91]Point!
[208:41.13]There he is!
[208:41.57]I see him!
[208:42.37]He's up there!
[208:43.61]There's a dragon over there!
[208:44.63]Alright.
[208:46.75]He wants me to lure him underneath the portcullis.
[208:52.56]What the fuck do you want me to do?
[208:55.56]Alright, good luck.
[209:03.12]I don't know.
[209:04.00]What is it?
[209:04.54]It wants me to lure him underneath something, I guess.
[209:07.64]Can I freeze him?
[209:16.44]I don't think so.
[209:20.98]Telekinesis something?
[209:21.88]I gotta move this.
[209:30.75]Alright.
[209:31.31]I have the Cheez-Its over here.
[209:34.09]Can I pick this shit up?
[209:44.51]Okay.
[209:46.99]Where am I?
[209:47.49]Am I insane or is this not clear to me where the fuck this thing is?
[209:53.08]Do I have to cut his fucking head off?
[210:10.13]Get these out of my way before I fucking lose again.
[210:12.01]Alright, we're good.
[210:19.41]Stop.
[210:19.55]Jesus.
[210:19.67]So you're telling me I can like smash his neck in this?
[210:41.09]Am I pretending to be dumb?
[210:42.11]No, I'm eating food.
[210:44.39]I'm addicted to Cheez-Its.
[211:00.26]Got it, right here.
[211:00.82]Alright, come on through here.
[211:13.24]Follow me.
[211:15.12]Follow me, you dumb dragon.
[211:16.50]Hello?
[211:30.93]Don't make him trip on the ice.
[211:38.77]Just use the portcullis bow.
[211:41.00]Um, she's gonna die.
[211:43.36]Can she get fucking cover, please?
[211:45.48]What the?
[211:45.86]She didn't even try!
[211:46.62]She didn't even try to get out of the fucking way!
[211:54.18]She wasn't even attempting to move, she just died.
[211:56.57]Give me the fucking bow.
[212:05.37]Where am I?
[212:11.02]Here he comes.
[212:11.70]Okay, come on.
[212:14.99]I just need to use my accusing finger.
[212:21.45]Come over here, you big dumb alien.
[212:25.59]Come over here.
[212:28.27]I'm a bad... You want to come after me.
[212:34.67]Come on.
[212:35.63]Follow me.
[212:38.19]Isn't this annoying you?
[212:39.07]I'm gonna fucking die.
[212:40.85]Alright, come on.
[212:42.43]Let me see your head.
[212:47.22]Ooh, sorry about that.
[212:48.60]Kind of looks like the alien.
[212:57.27]I told you he was an alien.
[213:01.41]Whoa, why did this fucking stupid idiot streamer call him an alien?
[213:04.53]Look at his head.
[213:08.07]Whoa.
[213:10.09]Oh, but he's an idiot.
[213:13.45]Give me a break.
[213:20.98]Alright, is he dead?
[213:21.72]Can I lift this bag up?
[213:27.37]We did it!
[213:29.11]You did it!
[213:32.05]I can open a passage, but I don't know what you'll find.
[213:33.89]Collect the dragon soul.
[213:40.13]Brilliant.
[213:42.33]You know, if it had been me, I would have thanked you properly.
[213:49.43]We'll get to the next area and we'll be done.
[213:58.07]I'm just trying to push her in the hole.
[214:04.14]I'm fucking addicted to Cheez-Its.
[214:07.90]What is that?
[214:09.32]Alright, I gotta put the ice sword back on.
[214:17.04]Let's go.
[214:18.22]Hey, there we are.
[214:21.04]Compact streamer with crippling cheese addiction accuses dinosaur of being alien.
[214:25.73]That was alien.
[214:30.35]Now what?
[214:31.23]Now we're in the spider cavern.
[214:32.73]You guys got what you wanted.
[214:35.75]You got what you want.
[214:38.03]We're in Shelob's dungeon.
[214:44.28]At least you got what you fucking wanted.
[214:47.09]There's a guy right here.
[214:48.81]Put a fucking mercy kill.
[214:52.19]I knew it.
[214:57.35]Dead?
[214:58.29]Or is it not dead?
[214:59.31]It's dead now.
[215:07.90]Watch it.
[215:13.56]Flurry.
[215:14.44]Block.
[215:15.28]Got it.
[215:20.48]That's a fucking double kill, right?
[215:22.00]No, it's not.
[215:22.48]Now it is.
[215:27.98]One more.
[215:29.48]Dead.
[215:31.54]You can't pick these up.
[215:35.12]Is that somebody's backpack?
[215:36.38]Or is that a giant ant's head?
[215:42.51]Oh, okay.
[215:42.99]You can get stuck in that.
[215:44.05]Of course you can.
[215:48.61]Maybe a giant spider.
[215:49.73]Oh, man.
[215:51.83]This actually is a scary game.
[215:56.19]Stupid poison.
[215:59.54]Wow, that ticks real, real quick.
[216:02.36]That ticks real quickly.
[216:08.10]That's not a joke.
[216:12.70]Alright, I gotta trip them.
[216:13.92]Can they slip?
[216:20.66]I don't know what's happening.
[216:21.38]I'm stuck in a fucking corner.
[216:23.74]I can't get out of here.
[216:27.52]Oh my god.
[216:36.27]I just ran up and was like, hey, I'm coming for you.
[216:43.57]So I don't want to get hit.
[216:45.87]Shit.
[216:46.39]Okay, time to...
[217:00.40]God damn it.
[217:02.04]I'm out of fucking antidotes, bros!
[217:08.78]Bro, what the fuck am I doing?
[217:13.12]Out of antidotes, bros?
[217:17.46]I'm gonna get so lost in here.
[217:23.90]Oh, I'm gonna get lost.
[217:26.57]I need fire.
[217:27.91]I feel like if I was a video game, right, and we were in a spider cavern, it would be fire.
[217:35.31]That's what I would program.
[217:36.45]Did I already go over this way?
[217:43.73]I think I've already been this way.
[217:49.01]No, I didn't!
[217:51.81]What the fuck?
[217:53.57]I'm dead.
[217:54.83]I'm dead.
[218:03.48]Um... God.
[218:09.74]There was two spiders there.
[218:10.86]Alright, get in the inventory, please.
[218:20.49]Okay, they died.
[218:20.99]That's what I get for not using the rope bow.
[218:30.13]This looks like a snow level.
[218:34.09]Secret area.
[218:36.11]That's a key.
[218:37.97]Anything else?
[218:41.15]No.
[218:43.57]Well.
[218:47.49]Nothing else, huh?
[218:48.82]I did find a key.
[218:52.68]To drop both the enemies.
[218:55.74]I don't think I want to do that.
[218:57.28]And why do I keep... I still hear bugs.
[219:05.40]Okay, this way.
[219:13.66]There's one guy.
[219:16.14]Still alive.
[219:16.90]Fucking little asshole.
[219:29.77]Die!
[219:33.16]Heal!
[219:37.35]Oh, my screen.
[219:39.09]Heal.
[219:41.07]What is it?
[219:41.41]Stellometer?
[219:41.93]I have to drop, dodge, and roll?
[219:43.75]What the fuck is going on here?
[219:44.81]How long does it last?
[219:51.27]Climb out of the spider pit.
[219:55.11]Is this ever going to end?
[219:58.25]I had to use it.
[220:06.72]Well, here's where I can climb.
[220:07.76]I should be using the rope bow from a distance.
[220:15.50]Of course they can.
[220:16.22]Oh lord.
[220:17.08]Where's my rope bow?
[220:34.17]There's a bug!
[220:34.77]There's a bug!
[220:35.17]There's a bug in the room!
[220:36.41]Hold on a second!
[220:36.89]There's a bug in the room!
[220:37.59]It's on me.
[220:42.80]It's on me, I think.
[220:47.10]I think we need to get up there to get out.
[220:49.66]I swear I got a spider.
[220:56.98]It was just, like, right next to my face.
[220:58.64]Like, right over here.
[221:04.70]My brain is playing tricks on me.
[221:05.86]I need some fucking sedative cheeses.
[221:08.29]You're going to eat these sedative quality cheeses.
[221:26.26]Where'd they go?
[221:29.88]I love how I gave myself a rope bow right here.
[221:33.37]Where it's completely fucking unnecessary.
[221:38.41]Hey, at least I did it, right guys?
[221:48.15]There's another one.
[221:48.93]There it is.
[221:49.37]Get it.
[221:49.59]Ah.
[221:53.87]You can jump from one rope to another.
[221:59.66]Can you?
[222:04.12]Where do I want this one?
[222:06.36]From here to there, right?
[222:08.28]Ah!
[222:08.74]Ah!
[222:09.32]Ah!
[222:11.97]What the fuck?
[222:12.67]How did they get over here?
[222:13.99]Get to it!
[222:14.39]Jump!
[222:18.03]I can't drink!
[222:19.31]I can't drink anything!
[222:31.48]Where am I?
[222:32.68]Where am I?
[222:32.98]What happened?
[222:36.97]Jesus fucking Christ.
[222:49.85]Get these stupid... Oh, I hate these.
[222:56.14]Let me be fucking prepared this time.
[222:59.06]Get rid of telekinesis.
[223:00.90]Get rid of fucking lightning bolt.
[223:02.14]And get rid of flame arrow.
[223:05.72]None of them.
[223:06.66]None of them do shit here.
[223:08.98]Put the fucking antidote up here.
[223:12.46]Put the mana potion up here.
[223:13.64]Put the shrooms up there.
[223:15.96]And the healing potions.
[223:18.80]For the love of all that is sacred.
[223:21.84]And where's my rope bow?
[223:28.85]Let's go.
[223:32.48]Keep an eye on the walls, Sareth.
[223:34.30]The spiders could come from anywhere.
[223:44.18]Get up.
[223:48.24]Jesus Christ.
[223:59.64]I'm just getting to full health.
[224:06.48]Go.
[224:07.10]This time I'm not going to get jump scared.
[224:13.16]This way.
[224:19.56]Is it this way?
[224:20.76]I don't think it's this way.
[224:23.50]I don't think it's this way.
[224:26.80]It's not this way.
[224:29.47]Where is it?
[224:29.97]Which one?
[224:32.67]Oh, I'm in such deep shit.
[224:43.13]I can't make that jump.
[224:46.95]Can I, like, swing?
[224:47.73]There's no way I make that.
[224:52.03]I can't take it out.
[224:52.77]I'm dead.
[225:00.13]We're good.
[225:04.03]So, which way do I have to go?
[225:09.20]All the way up here?
[225:10.10]They're already here.
[225:13.02]All of them.
[225:13.96]And I can't get out.
[225:14.52]I'm dead.
[225:20.68]Okay, God.
[225:22.07]Like, why are they so quickly here?
[225:26.62]And I fucking missed.
[225:27.96]No I didn't.
[225:29.12]It doesn't go that far.
[225:31.44]Shit don't even go that far.
[225:38.20]I'm gonna kill the spiders.
[225:39.96]The spiders have to die.
[225:42.89]I will fight them right here.
[225:48.97]Just use the secret fucking technique.
[225:54.04]You will win.
[225:55.12]Just be careful.
[225:57.47]Bye-bye.
[225:59.81]Couple more.

[227:11.72]They just don't end.
[227:12.80]Alright, so that's not gonna work.
[227:29.16]I need to just get a minute.
[227:30.49]Like, I don't know where to go from here.
[227:32.21]Like, right here is the only spot I can go to.
[227:34.95]You can jump from rope to rope.
[227:36.71]That's fucking wonderful, game.
[227:38.71]Like, thanks for telling me that.
[227:40.75]Like, I didn't know that.
[227:42.87]I didn't know that you could jump from fucking rope to rope.
[227:45.57]That's interesting you bring that up.
[227:48.33]Where, but, which... This one is way too far to jump.
[227:53.70]I'm gonna try it, and I'm gonna lose, and it's gonna be fucking hilarious!
[228:02.62]I don't know what's happening.
[228:07.68]Alright, let's get it!
[228:18.15]Fuck outta here.

[228:33.12]Shoot two ropes?
[228:34.38]What?
[228:35.78]I thought one of them disappeared.
[228:38.15]Oh, what a crock of shit.
[228:39.33]I really thought the... I thought it was just one rope.
[228:43.03]How was I supposed to know that?
[228:44.11]I didn't know.
[228:45.31]Remember, this game's from like 2001.
[228:53.47]I didn't know.
[228:53.79]I thought I was going to despawn the rope.
[228:55.05]There's a fucking bug on me, I swear to God.

[231:03.27]I swear to God.
[231:03.93]And, like, it's fucking me up.
[231:07.98]I was just in the wall.
[231:08.86]And then we go inside the wall.
[231:14.02]I'm gonna fucking get one of those bug bombs.
[231:16.38]And set it off in here.
[231:17.44]And fucking just film it and laugh.
