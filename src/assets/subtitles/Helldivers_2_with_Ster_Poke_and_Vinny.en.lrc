[00:00.03]That's what it feels like.
[00:03.93]What were you saying?
[00:04.49]That the game, like, if you play the game without... If you change your loadout, the game crashes?
[00:12.36]Yeah, it'll permanently crash when you open it.
[00:14.50]If you change your loadout before you beat one real mission.
[00:18.34]Yo, Stir.
[00:20.18]Can we talk about that DM I sent you, Stir?
[00:22.90]Do you want to?
[00:26.11]Yeah, because I... Do you know what happened?
[00:30.12]No.
[00:31.08]I didn't.
[00:31.58]Okay.
[00:32.96]I said it was your birthday, so I messaged you.
[00:35.10]I said, happy birthday.
[00:36.58]And the phone auto-corrected your name to Steve.
[00:39.62]So I said, happy birthday, Steve.
[00:42.07]And then I said, Steve, lol.
[00:43.37]And I thought you thought it would be funny, too, because I thought you thought it auto-corrected.
[00:47.79]But then you were like, happy birthday.
[00:49.67]Thanks, Georgie, lol.
[00:52.59]You thought I was trying to say your name.
[00:54.03]What did I just join, too?
[00:57.36]I don't know what other response you would have expected from me.
[01:01.72]Wow.
[01:03.16]Hey, guys.
[01:03.82]How you doing?
[01:04.26]What's up, Vinny?
[01:05.78]Yo, what do you mean, what's up?
[01:09.37]It's the perfect way to start a conversation.
[01:11.43]Why are you so upset about conversation starters?
[01:13.61]What's wrong with you?
[01:14.65]Vinny, tell us what's up.
[01:17.09]It's my ceiling, the sky, Jesus, the Lord and Savior Christ.
[01:24.98]And?
[01:26.54]Uh, that's about it.
[01:27.66]What else is up?
[01:28.10]Helldivers!

[01:33.00]Dude, I feel like this is gonna be super fucking fun.

[01:45.55]I'm ready.
[01:46.19]I didn't change my loadout.

[02:44.63]Good to see you again.
[02:47.72]I've got a couple of small things to talk about at the end of the stream.

[03:27.41]I just say stuff.
[03:29.17]You say stuff.
[03:32.85]So what's the name of your, uh, what's the name of your ship?
[03:38.83]Mine's the Fist of Benevolence, I think.
[03:41.65]Uh, mine is Star of the Stars.
[03:44.15]That's pretty good.
[03:46.69]Mine's, um, Whisper of Judgment?
[03:52.77]Where are you?
[03:56.97]Vinny is offline and I cannot invite him.
[03:59.35]Oh, what the heck?
[04:02.41]Do I leave the tutorial or just finish it?
[04:04.93]Finish the tutorial will put you on a spaceship.
[04:08.49]And then I can invite you.
[04:14.74]Greetings.
[04:15.52]This is like a grid based strategy game, right?
[04:17.52]Where we all we get like each like a hexagon grid.
[04:19.56]We get a square.
[04:21.92]Yeah.
[04:23.13]Pretty cool.
[04:24.05]And the part that you're going to really like about this game is that once you have the hexagon square, you get to, like, furnish it.
[04:29.26]What?
[04:30.56]And, like, if you drop anything, you have to, like, clean it.
[04:32.48]Like, if you drop a tomato jar, like, you have to clean up the tomato sauce, but you have to use the right cleaner because otherwise it stains.
[04:38.86]You mean on the ground?
[04:39.74]Like, if I drop it on the ground?
[04:41.18]Yeah.
[04:41.88]Really?
[04:42.92]Well, it's worse if you drop it on a rug because it has a real-time fabric simulation.
[04:46.73]Oh, is this a cleaning game?
[04:48.33]Yeah.
[04:49.73]Okay, okay.
[04:50.54]I played that once.
[04:51.32]There's like, you can clean a crime scene up.
[04:53.31]Remember that?
[04:54.77]That was a good one.
[04:55.71]Stir hates that game though.
[04:57.87]I hate Power Wash Simulator.
[04:59.25]It actually gives me like massive anxiety and it makes me super unhappy.
[05:04.05]It made me pretty unhappy.
[05:05.44]Sir, we played Viscera Cleanup Detail for like two hours and the whole time you were just silently trying to tell me how bad you wanted to fucking leave the game.
[05:12.51]You were just like, hey, this is like, you know the thing that I do to you?
[05:15.81]Like, well, kind of cool.
[05:17.43]All right.
[05:18.27]You did that like times a hundred during Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[05:20.07]Well, you want to know what you do to me?
[05:21.29]Is you ask me to play a game with you and then you say, no, it'll be fun.
[05:24.79]I know you will hate this.
[05:25.88]Let's do it.
[05:27.20]That's happened on like five separate occasions.
[05:29.60]That's not that many over the course of a 10-year friendship, okay?
[05:33.78]Five times?
[05:34.66]That's not very many.
[05:35.42]Yeah, well, maybe if we talked more.
[05:39.38]Oh, man.
[05:41.86]Can I guilt trip one of you now?
[05:43.48]Well, no, you're offline.
[05:44.38]You have to be online to guilt trip.
[05:46.70]Oh, that's why you can't invite me.
[05:48.26]Okay, got it.
[05:48.78]Hang on.
[05:52.10]Try now, Star?
[05:53.71]It's too early for this fight.
[05:55.85]Star and I don't fight.
[05:58.98]We hash it out.
[06:02.96]We lay it all on the table.
[06:06.84]Stir just DMs me about you guys' problems.
[06:10.96]Is it Stir's birthday or did he say stuff?
[06:14.33]No, it is not Stir's birthday.
[06:16.51]Okay.
[06:18.39]He's acting like he knows when my birthday is.
[06:20.17]I do, actually.
[06:20.85]December 10th.
[06:24.65]Ster, why are you not walking back and forth to fulfill your ADD brain?
[06:30.37]Why are you not doing this?
[06:31.37]You gotta do the walk slide.
[06:35.26]Why is my guy cold?
[06:37.66]It's weird.
[06:38.54]I don't know, because you were in the cryo chamber.
[06:42.08]Did you guys name your ship?
[06:45.68]Yeah.
[06:46.15]Fist of Benevolence.
[06:47.99]Oh, you're coming through to push the talk.
[06:49.41]You sound cool, though.
[06:50.31]Hold on, keep talking.
[06:52.44]Who?
[06:53.26]Oh, me?
[06:53.82]Oh, shit.
[06:55.08]I got to turn that off.
[06:55.80]Hang on.
[06:57.04]But you got to do some cool stuff.
[06:58.08]You got to say stuff in a robot way.
[07:04.84]We need additional pilots.
[07:07.10]I don't know.
[07:09.16]What the hell is a hell diver?
[07:11.00]That actually sounds kind of cool.
[07:12.29]I'm not going to lie.
[07:13.99]Does it distort the audio?
[07:16.15]No, it almost enhances your audio.
[07:19.79]I can't hear it.
[07:20.63]I disabled.
[07:22.47]Oh.
[07:22.77]I'm loading in right now.
[07:24.45]I don't actually... I don't know what Helldivers is.
[07:27.87]I've never played it.
[07:28.80]In fact, I didn't know this game existed until, like, you mentioned it, Ster.
[07:32.76]That's the kind of games I like to play.
[07:35.94]Is this Starship Troopers, but, like, bug?
[07:38.62]Other bugs instead of the bugs?
[07:40.46]God, I hope so.
[07:41.84]This one leaned really heavy into Starship Troopers.
[07:44.61]I don't think the first one was so on the nose.
[07:48.33]Okay.
[07:49.75]So are we all going to be the same character with the same loadout?
[07:52.49]Well, we have to beat one mission and then we can change.
[07:54.59]Okay.
[07:56.75]Don't change now.
[07:58.77]Unless you don't want to play secretly.
[08:01.80]Yeah, don't touch any of that.
[08:03.10]That is bad.
[08:04.82]Don't do it.
[08:06.82]How much have you played Stir?
[08:08.38]I haven't.
[08:09.10]Sure.
[08:09.36]I'm level one!
[08:14.18]This is that this is a smurf account.
[08:16.18]It's a smurf.
[08:17.60]I love that phrase so much.
[08:19.96]Do we all grab the side of the table?
[08:24.09]Yeah, I want to be included.
[08:26.79]You see them.
[08:27.43]Do you see the map?
[08:29.57]I can see the Orion sector and it is 81% liberated.
[08:35.61]Yeah, OK, well, we're going to look.
[08:37.52]We're going to liberate that car, OK?
[08:42.76]I guess.
[08:46.35]Is this a sponsored stream?
[08:47.61]Says a chat member of mine.
[08:48.67]I don't... I haven't done those.
[08:50.89]Is this for anyone or no?
[08:52.25]No.
[08:52.61]I don't think so.
[08:53.81]I think we all bought this.
[08:56.68]My main stream stick is I play games no one's heard of that they think is sponsored and look like mobile games.
[09:02.02]I love those types of games.
[09:03.48]We should pretend we're sponsored though.
[09:06.16]Maybe they'll send us like a deodorant.
[09:08.88]Hold on a second.
[09:13.22]Let me mix this up.
[09:13.98]Okay.
[09:18.50]okay there was like a three stage selecting the planet selecting the universe uh defend freedom here's the thing guys friendly fire friendly fire is on yeah it is kind of expected in this game that it is inevitable that we will end up killing each other by accident however if you do a I killed you joke to me I will find you mission coordinates uh
[09:47.41]Get in your goddamn hell pod.
[09:49.29]Get in your pod.
[09:50.55]Wait, can we both?
[09:52.02]Can I steal a pod?
[09:52.70]Can we all go in the same pod?
[09:54.02]You cannot get in my hell pod.
[09:58.80]What the fuck?
[10:00.32]Where should I drop?
[10:00.82]This is a very brutalist universe.
[10:02.76]Like, they just don't give a shit about, like, comfort.
[10:05.95]Who is that?
[10:06.43]Who's green?
[10:07.77]I'm P4.
[10:08.13]I'm spinning.
[10:10.07]I'm V3.
[10:10.61]Hey, boys, where are we dropping?
[10:14.95]Tomato Town.
[10:15.83]Can I drop in the ocean?
[10:19.02]Oh, we get it.
[10:20.66]I don't know.
[10:23.00]We gotta turn this to kill me broadcast.
[10:27.17]Alright, let's see.
[10:27.77]Let's let's all just go to the same.
[10:29.49]Yeah, it's all gonna save spot.
[10:32.05]Alright, now don't touch this right?
[10:33.15]Do not do not equip anything.
[10:36.08]So just hold continue ready up.
[10:38.32]Yeah.
[10:39.77]which we're oh that's not me well now why sir why can't we do this uh because your game will crash and then when you launch your game again it will crash that's awesome way it was I I can't ready up I have to pick something yeah I have to pick something too sure what do we pick um are you sure do we press enter yeah yeah my my offensive right
[11:04.51]that would be a pretty massive oversight I mean I guess these are the defaults right I think this is fine but don't like change your gun don't press r to change equipment okay just don't change your outfit people are saying okay well let's just get through one okay yeah I like modern games where they add these kind of like land mines in
[11:32.21]Yeah, I agree.
[11:33.49]Are we ready?
[11:34.03]I think gamers have been getting it too easy for too long.
[11:39.51]Modern gamers have not played Echo the Dolphin.
[11:44.40]You didn't even play Echo the Dolphin.
[11:47.16]What the hell?
[11:47.62]What?
[11:50.48]I think that kills us, by the way.
[11:51.90]I think that's going to kill us instantly.
[11:54.97]What?
[11:55.61]There's no way we're surviving this.
[11:56.97]Wouldn't all the hamburger you ate at like noon go into your brain?
[12:01.05]It's the future.
[12:02.67]Yeah, they put you in bullets and shoot you to the planet like this.
[12:06.76]This company doesn't care about us.
[12:08.16]I'm starting to think.
[12:09.80]Yeah, this is quite the lethal company.
[12:12.20]All right.
[12:13.68]I like that.
[12:15.10]You know, lower the volume seems loud.
[12:18.81]I did.
[12:19.03]I turned it down already.
[12:19.71]It's still kind of loud.
[12:20.33]I think it's alright though.
[12:21.09]It's loud.
[12:22.17]Alright, so we're on an alien planet.
[12:23.53]This is fucking sick, by the way.
[12:25.96]Let's go.
[12:26.28]It looks nice.
[12:26.68]It's beautiful.
[12:27.70]I like how everyone has like their own... I'm already hurt.
[12:30.38]I think I'm hurt.
[12:30.78]Who the hell wants to die?
[12:37.24]Don't touch the plants.
[12:38.43]Don't touch anything.
[12:39.33]Okay.
[12:40.47]I was apparently slowed.
[12:41.23]Be very careful.
[12:42.80]Sorry for that noise.
[12:44.34]That genuinely actually caught me completely off guard.
[12:46.90]The blue plants are bullshit.
[12:48.48]Don't touch them.
[12:49.28]Okay.
[12:50.60]Can we detonate them?
[12:53.96]I hate them.
[12:54.42]Yeah, I think detonate.
[12:57.21]I like that everybody got their own call sign.
[12:59.45]So, like, Vinny is V3.
[13:01.53]That's cool.
[13:02.39]And then combo fucking meal.
[13:04.73]What?
[13:05.71]I know who everyone is.
[13:07.01]Who is C2?
[13:08.05]Who am I?
[13:10.29]I don't know.
[13:10.71]Who are you, Pope?
[13:11.43]I'm P4.
[13:11.75]Are you P4?
[13:13.82]I did it again.
[13:14.66]Oh my god!
[13:16.86]I don't think it hurts us, though.
[13:17.88]I think it just is annoying.
[13:18.98]It takes half my health away.
[13:25.38]Wait, it's spam prone.
[13:26.42]Yeah, this is the easiest way to get around.
[13:30.00]Not the sprint button?
[13:31.36]Which Boba Fett are you?
[13:32.66]Wait, there's the sprint button.
[13:33.38]There's the sprint button.
[13:33.98]You're right.
[13:35.70]No, I think this is better because you avoid terrain.
[13:40.44]Wait, guys, monsters right here.
[13:42.60]Wait, there are monsters.
[13:44.18]Cool.
[13:47.15]Oops, I just healed.
[13:48.33]Oh, no.
[13:48.65]I'm out of heals already, Poke.
[13:52.77]There's so much bloom.
[13:54.33]I don't think I shot an enemy.
[13:55.49]I just was shooting over there to fit in with you guys.
[13:58.82]It is quite bloomy.
[14:00.40]Yeah, this is a very bloomy game.
[14:01.86]That's okay.
[14:05.51]Why not?
[14:06.13]That one was a baby.
[14:07.49]It's a baby one.
[14:09.15]Baby right here.
[14:09.65]Baby right here.
[14:12.51]Really, V3?
[14:14.55]Sorry about that.
[14:15.82]I panicked.
[14:18.12]Really?
[14:18.88]Really, V3?
[14:19.52]Hey, S1.
[14:21.28]Honestly?
[14:21.76]Yeah.
[14:23.02]For real, C2?
[14:23.74]Dude, okay.
[14:25.78]You can see the aim down sights, kind of laser sight.
[14:30.38]I almost just walked right into that and just got shot in the head.
[14:33.60]I'll take care of this.
[14:35.29]Right-click and press middle mouse.
[14:37.91]Oh, shit.
[14:38.53]Cool.
[14:39.49]Oh, sick.
[14:40.97]There's a ton of bullet drop, though, so you're going to want to shoot really high.
[14:43.63]Oh, I have to enter Konami code.
[14:46.93]Hang on.
[14:47.56]It's kind of like DayZ, where if somebody was a mile away, you had to shoot 15 feet into the air on your screen, and it would dark all the way down.
[14:54.26]I'm pretty sure DayZ is the only game to have ever done that.
[14:57.20]No, it is.
[14:57.94]I'm glad you know that.
[14:59.40]It's weird because it doesn't even work like that in real life.
[15:02.73]No, there was an old man sniper who was playing a sniper game, and it worked.
[15:07.77]That was a terrible sentence.
[15:09.09]That makes no sense, but I'm serious.
[15:10.77]It's real.
[15:11.33]That was real.
[15:11.79]Did you input the Konami code?
[15:13.11]What are we doing?
[15:13.55]I did, yeah.
[15:15.03]Well, one of them.
[15:15.63]Maybe there's more.
[15:16.45]Oh, I think we have to... They hold R?
[15:18.70]We have to get the signal.
[15:21.28]Oh, okay.
[15:21.60]That's going to be US-1.
[15:25.00]We're all covered in blood.
[15:25.98]I got it.
[15:27.38]Signal got.
[15:27.92]What are you doing?
[15:29.58]We did it!
[15:34.12]I don't like these green lasers being put on me.
[15:38.43]We just beat the level.
[15:40.43]Hold R. Cool.
[15:43.68]Try diving into chairs.
[15:45.94]It's really cool.
[15:46.70]Oh, that kind of hurts.
[15:49.46]Oh my god, it actually did hurt!
[15:50.82]Hey, alright, everybody dive into each other at the same exact time.
[15:53.64]So let's stay in, like, equal amount of way.
[15:55.50]And just all dive into each other.
[15:57.02]Like, into the middle.
[15:58.34]Truly, we are Helldivers.
[15:59.32]On the light?
[15:59.88]Like, alright, dude.
[16:00.40]On the light.
[16:01.00]Yeah, like, imagine this, like, the last slice of pizza, and it's like, we're at the Super Bowl, like, we're having a party, and it's like, who's gonna get it?
[16:05.60]Alright, ready?
[16:07.36]One, two, three, go.
[16:10.84]That was not as funny as I thought it was gonna be.
[16:12.52]I'm sorry.
[16:13.20]Yeah, that's alright.
[16:15.60]I just like how you can control everyone with your aura of fear.
[16:20.97]That's the name of my ship in this game, Aura of Fear.
[16:23.77]How do we get out of here?
[16:24.59]It said extract.
[16:26.07]Do you see the giant blue light pointing up directly into the sky?
[16:31.39]I see a red light and a blue light.
[16:33.22]That's a very thin light, by the way.
[16:35.48]My screen was looking over here.
[16:37.10]I didn't see it.
[16:38.76]There was like a whole thing that happened.
[16:40.40]You may proceed to extraction when ready.
[16:43.62]I'm lost.
[16:45.54]It's a very thin light.
[16:47.30]Bug's behind us.
[16:48.08]Watch out, P4.
[16:58.13]That really hurt.
[16:58.69]That really hurt.
[16:59.69]Hold on, hold on.
[17:00.99]I don't know what happened.
[17:01.93]Hey, guys!
[17:03.70]Hey, check this shit out.
[17:05.36]I'll get him!
[17:07.94]Oh, that's you.
[17:08.92]Why are you shooting me?
[17:10.34]I'm a humanoid.
[17:11.06]I don't know, dude.
[17:13.02]We didn't really have to do anything in this mission.
[17:14.66]We just pressed... Stur just mashed a keyboard and we left.
[17:18.15]Yeah, pretty much.
[17:21.37]Oh, there's a hole, like...
[17:23.52]They give the easiest missions to their weakest soldiers.
[17:26.48]What is it when there's a bunch of bugs?
[17:27.98]Like gaggle, platoon, murder of bugs?
[17:30.84]I don't know.
[17:32.90]Swarm.
[17:34.18]Yeah, that makes sense.
[17:41.47]Reinforce, resupply.
[17:47.97]Oh, nice.
[17:48.43]Machine gun.
[17:49.55]That's mine.
[17:50.23]I called it in.
[17:50.93]Get your own.
[17:53.51]You know how you just did the tutorial?
[17:54.91]I wonder what happens if you stand under the resupply.
[18:02.82]Let's all do it.
[18:06.00]I don't know, maybe one of us do it.
[18:11.80]Killed by combo meal!
[18:14.83]Well, I killed everyone.
[18:19.43]I didn't think everyone was going to die.
[18:21.45]Oh, you got everyone.
[18:23.15]That's awesome.
[18:24.45]Yeah, this is great work.
[18:25.75]Yeah, I know where you live.
[18:30.39]Do you think I'm going to lose to the three bugs that are in the first mission?
[18:32.91]I'll be fine.
[18:33.45]Can I wait?
[18:33.93]I can.
[18:34.33]I can rest.
[18:36.68]What is it?
[18:37.72]Not reinforced.
[18:38.56]You hold control.
[18:39.48]Reinforce.
[18:40.08]There's a bug on you, man.
[18:41.34]Throw my corpse in the fucking garbage.
[18:48.67]Why is his name Combo Mule?
[18:50.27]I think it was assigned by the game.
[18:54.09]Is that your Steam name?
[18:56.71]How do you revive?
[18:57.71]I know you can.
[18:59.99]It is the Reinforce.
[19:01.97]Oh, okay.
[19:05.45]Those bugs on my screen have just frozen in place.
[19:08.39]Not exploding.
[19:09.69]That's really weird.
[19:10.29]Wait, I'm still lying on the ground.
[19:15.12]You're blending in with the environment.
[19:20.14]Yeah, don't worry.
[19:20.54]You're not gonna die to the three bugs.
[19:22.70]I have no fucking ammo left.
[19:24.54]He might die to his own grenade, though.
[19:25.95]What the fuck?
[19:26.83]I'm in the floor.
[19:28.27]Yeah, it just zoomed in on my corpse for no good reason.
[19:31.45]Alright, I gotta reinforce.
[19:34.07]He's using it.
[19:40.73]I'm back.
[19:41.59]I'm here, yeah.
[19:43.03]Okay, that killed you.
[19:44.11]Did I just kill you with my res?
[19:48.26]I couldn't have timed that any better, honestly.
[20:02.23]Do we need to get Jerma back before we leave?
[20:04.99]He killed us all.
[20:06.79]No, you guys are fine.
[20:17.80]So that's what this game is.
[20:20.44]Oh.
[20:21.66]Well, just imagine what I did as an alarm clock.
[20:23.14]I was just kind of waking you guys up a little.
[20:25.12]All right.
[20:32.58]So just for you to know, if you throw an orbital strike on your teammates, it's about like a hundred yards wide.
[20:43.25]Just in case for the future funny comedy jokes you guys are going to make.
[20:47.41]Okay.
[20:51.83]Yeah, there's at least, like, three clips.
[20:53.92]Three or four clips already.
[20:55.54]So that's pretty good.
[20:56.46]If you want to clip farm further, I think we should probably throw our reinforcements into each other.
[21:00.56]Yeah.
[21:01.70]So that would be awesome.
[21:03.76]I think we set up a thing where, like, me and Poke are, like, sitting down eating, like, dinner.
[21:08.84]And, like, Stir crashes down at the table.
[21:11.41]Like, he lands straight on the table and, like, gets us.
[21:13.63]I don't know.
[21:14.21]What do you guys think?
[21:15.01]We probably should have muted before we did joke stuff.
[21:17.83]End your stream.
[21:20.57]I didn't know this was going to be improv night.
[21:25.49]Yeah, all of us.
[21:26.51]The three Boba Fetts.
[21:27.15]This is my birthday.
[21:27.97]I just wanted to play Helldive.
[21:32.84]I don't get to stand up there.
[21:33.78]I just have to watch you guys.
[21:34.82]That's not fair.
[21:36.92]Yeah, because you killed us all and then died.
[21:40.62]welcome back democracy's reach extends can we unlock can we play the game for real now I want to play the game for real let's acquisition first yeah what should we I think it wants us to buy real life money I mean you know what I mean something like that oh does it oh super store is this super super credits um
[22:07.55]yeah I don't know about that thank you sony for sponsoring super is it actually called super credits yeah yeah because it's super earth oh there's a there's another store they have item reviews I have one from family man 123 it says great for camping trips with the kids a bit heavy for them though in relation to the the armor set that you can buy with real life money
[22:34.35]Wait, there's reviews?
[22:35.99]Check the Superstore in the Acquisition Center.
[22:40.33]Mine's Golf Dad.
[22:42.45]Golf Dad 22.
[22:43.01]Wait, are these fake reviews?
[22:46.65]Wait a second.
[22:47.35]This is definitely fake.
[22:48.19]Yeah, this is like a joke thing.
[22:49.49]It has to be.
[22:50.45]All these reviews have been devised by Super Earth's Ministry of Truth.
[22:53.81]Okay, yeah.
[22:54.37]These are not real plays.
[22:58.31]It turns out the war bonds, from what my chat's saying, the medals that we acquired, those are in-game.
[23:03.24]So, we don't have to buy that, you know.
[23:05.48]You can use real money on stuff, but you can also just use your medals.
[23:09.90]Okay.
[23:10.28]Wait, you can play?
[23:13.28]This is a game?
[23:17.17]I don't think we have very many options right now.
[23:18.95]I think that was just the, hey, this is the first mission, just have one of your friends orbital strike the group and then laugh and then actually play the game.
[23:25.63]Okay.
[23:25.77]Yep.
[23:34.10]You can upgrade your ship as well.
[23:36.42]You don't have to pay anything.
[23:38.07]How do you pronounce that?
[23:41.63]Fenrir?
[23:42.11]Fenrir.
[23:44.87]I don't think we can go there yet.
[23:50.29]We have to continue.
[23:51.19]Kill bugs.
[23:52.43]I like killing bugs.
[23:53.43]It's still easy, but it's harder easy.
[24:04.02]which starship which starship troopers movie is your favorite one two three or four I until you just said that forgot that they made more and I am aware of how bad they are I yeah I I just thought there was a the first one I got dc'd
[24:22.75]Never mind.
[24:24.21]I'm still here.
[24:25.21]You're still here?
[24:26.13]It was a fake DC.
[24:26.93]Hell divers to hell pods.
[24:30.93]Make sure you go to the hell cafeteria for your hell breakfast at hell morning.
[24:37.23]Let's just land on the eggs.
[24:39.15]Dive right into your breakfast.
[24:43.87]Alright, so I don't think we have very much equipment.
[24:48.56]What do we even have?
[24:51.55]There's a couple different uniforms you can choose from.
[24:54.03]I don't know if those permanently crash your game, but... Alright, cool.
[25:08.14]Sorry, uh, stratagems?
[25:10.02]Right.
[25:11.65]How do you do that?
[25:12.75]Oh.
[25:14.87]Got it.
[25:15.65]Ready.
[25:17.17]Ready.
[25:18.01]Ready.
[25:26.83]You ever see like the coffee that they sell that's like death coffee or hell coffee?
[25:32.73]Hell coffee?
[25:34.11]Yeah, like they have like Diablo coffee or like demon coffee.
[25:37.43]It's supposed to have like enough caffeine to kill you.
[25:40.64]Black death coffee and it starts the plague.
[25:43.30]Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[25:46.98]They serve that aboard our ship.
[25:51.60]Actually, is the audio good?
[25:53.80]Is this too loud or is it fine?
[25:54.99]What do you guys think?
[25:57.71]I'm tripping out too.
[25:58.36]I feel like the game is so loud.
[25:59.50]Yeah.
[26:05.60]Alright, we gotta get the eggs.
[26:11.03]German, would you rather be a green bean or a potato?
[26:16.85]What?
[26:19.37]You guys have a weird dynamic.
[26:20.99]I don't even know.
[26:21.45]I honestly didn't really hear what he said.
[26:23.09]I heard green beans, potatoes.
[26:26.57]Would you rather be a green bean or a potato?
[26:30.80]Yo, Vinny, read my DM, dude.
[26:33.06]I can't.
[26:33.64]What do you mean read the DM?
[26:35.56]Remember what I was talking about?
[26:37.90]Read it again.
[26:38.60]It's happening.
[26:41.81]Oh, right.
[26:42.25]Yeah.
[26:43.29]Send me that DM because there might be more happening than you're aware.
[26:49.79]Why is everybody, how come send DMs to me too?
[26:52.59]What?
[26:53.09]No, don't.
[26:54.16]What do you mean no?
[26:58.22]I called an orbital in.
[27:00.38]It's too, I, okay.
[27:01.80]That's a good idea.
[27:02.36]I feel like we can just shoot them.
[27:03.64]I think we gotta get up there and like close the bug hole.
[27:07.76]Throw a grenade in it.
[27:10.61]I think I'm going to drop my graphics down to like zero because I can't even tell what's on the screen.
[27:15.69]It's all like smoke and fog and green acid.
[27:19.09]It's water!
[27:19.49]Yeah, I think that's deliberate.
[27:21.35]You didn't answer the question either, but that's fine.
[27:28.52]We can see the eggs.
[27:29.68]12 out of 19.
[27:32.22]Oh shit, we almost have it.
[27:34.53]Wow, how did we do it?
[27:35.69]We started right near the objective.
[27:37.25]Okay.
[27:39.98]I feel like they're spending more money on us dropping in pods than it is to actually do these missions.
[27:46.24]There's another set of eggs.
[27:47.62]Oh, okay.
[27:48.95]There's more eggs.
[27:51.85]Hang on.
[27:52.15]Let me see Poke's DM.
[27:53.65]It's the other direction, guys.
[27:55.67]I deleted it.
[27:56.91]No!
[27:59.41]Hey, shut up, all of you making fun of me in DMs.
[28:01.97]That's what you said, right?
[28:05.05]Check the new DM.
[28:06.69]What the heck?
[28:07.95]Who's talking shit about me in the DMs?
[28:11.14]Uh-oh.
[28:13.52]I'm burning.
[28:17.52]Bad smell air.
[28:18.88]Inbound.
[28:20.58]Watch out.
[28:21.20]The air smells bad.
[28:24.61]Grab your ammo if you need it.
[28:26.03]I think.
[28:28.51]It's like Deep Rock Galactic style reinforcements.
[28:34.35]I guess there's like four ammo per.
[28:40.07]If you reload too early, you waste your mag.
[28:42.11]Oh shit, that's right.
[28:43.27]I was wondering about that, and thank you for confirming.
[28:48.42]Yeah, no problem.
[28:50.98]This is the kind of game with guns in it.
[28:52.78]Oh, we're going the wrong way.
[28:57.46]We gotta go through here.
[28:59.57]How do you know where to go?
[29:00.37]Is there a map?
[29:01.17]Tab.
[29:02.75]He's played this before.
[29:03.55]I did the tutorial that you all did.
[29:07.61]I just dropped a pin so we can check the top.
[29:09.44]Yeah, that's good.
[29:10.06]Good thing he's not dead.
[29:17.08]You guys remember Lethal Company?
[29:19.62]Yeah.
[29:19.84]What happened to that game?
[29:21.46]Is it gone?
[29:24.28]I think the dev made like 50 million dollars and was probably just like, this is fucking pretty sick, alright.
[29:32.67]Dev is currently on private island.
[29:36.26]Hunter Roll?
[29:37.40]Other than that, I'm sure there's going to be some updates.
[29:39.78]Everyone's busy playing like one of the four survival crafting games that came out with either fake Pokemon in it or not.
[29:51.07]Or not.
[29:51.65]Did you guys play Power World?
[29:53.65]I played for like two hours.
[29:55.63]I played it the day before it came out and I was like, yeah, this is fine.
[29:59.11]And then that was it.
[30:00.93]I have not played it.
[30:04.09]Whoa.
[30:05.25]Yeah.
[30:08.26]Whoa.
[30:09.38]The new meta, the new game on Twitch that you guys need to check out if you haven't is called Infinite Craft.
[30:15.68]How did that go in?
[30:17.48]Infinite Craft?
[30:19.26]You just combine words.
[30:20.26]What the fuck is happening?
[30:21.85]That's it.
[30:34.40]Oh, um, how do you call an airstrike again?
[30:37.61]Hold control and you get all of your stratagems.
[30:40.67]Got it.
[30:41.07]You gotta do the special keybinds.
[30:45.13]Throwing one there.
[30:45.81]That was a bad orbital strike, I think, guys.
[30:53.03]That was alright.
[30:56.36]We gotta break the eggs.
[31:00.08]Love that.
[31:00.72]Ow!
[31:01.50]Love that for you.
[31:03.61]What the hell?
[31:07.03]I found there's some more glowy egg orbs.
[31:13.70]Dude, this would be so much easier if I had a katana.
[31:21.08]I think there's a melee, isn't there?
[31:23.72]I'm dropping a resupply right here.
[31:31.32]Oh shit.
[31:35.65]There is a melee, but it's not katana.
[31:41.05]Then whatever it is, it's less efficient.
[31:44.53]Ster, did you know you could buy a katana on the Atlantic City Boardwalk?
[31:49.08]That does not surprise me.
[31:53.12]I figured it wouldn't.
[31:53.92]Alright, the ammo indicator is kind of freaking me out here.
[31:58.14]It's like a little battery container.
[32:01.66]Okay, so you know how there's like a square thing you put in the bottom of a gun?
[32:09.22]That thing is filled up with liquid.
[32:11.72]And every time you pull the trigger, the liquid turns into a bullet.
[32:14.96]I want to turn on battery percentage in my iPhone because I like seeing the actual number next to it.
[32:24.83]They're going for a more realistic gaming experience here, I believe.
[32:29.69]We're going to go to the blue.
[32:32.09]Okay.
[32:34.47]Ster, I'm gonna make it a mission.
[32:35.68]Every time we play games, I'm bringing up some boardwalk town on the Jersey Shore.
[32:39.74]It will be a different one each time.
[32:41.88]I've actually never been to Atlantic City, though I've heard a lot about it.
[32:47.32]I was more of a Point Pleasant lad.
[32:49.76]Is it Atlanta?
[32:51.06]We can trade some lore.
[32:52.16]No, it's Jersey.
[32:54.04]I spent many years... Okay, true story.
[32:55.94]I got my first two cassette tapes at Point Pleasant.
[33:00.63]What were they?
[33:01.99]Nirvana, Bleach, and Incesticide.
[33:06.59]It's a weird name for an album, I know.
[33:08.25]It's not my fault.
[33:09.07]Didn't name it.
[33:11.71]Is it Death by Incest?
[33:13.99]I think so.
[33:14.57]Okay.
[33:16.55]Spent a lot of time at Point Pleasant.
[33:18.01]Got a hand jammy under the boardwalk.
[33:19.46]Was great.
[33:21.22]That... I'm kidding.
[33:22.34]That didn't happen.
[33:22.86]That also would not surprise me.
[33:24.92]I know.
[33:25.46]You have to be very careful.
[33:29.43]I was sick though.
[33:30.07]Did you ever see that Always Sunny episode with the Jersey Shore?
[33:37.96]Probably, but I don't recall.
[33:39.98]You'd like it knowing that you've been to the Jersey Shore.
[33:42.66]You'd like it.
[33:43.30]Yeah.
[33:44.26]I do remember.
[33:44.88]Yeah, I'm remembering now that there was one.
[33:47.10]I think I watched that.
[33:48.86]That was the first time on TV.
[33:50.42]I was like, hold up.
[33:51.18]This is why people get excited for like representation.
[33:54.23]I've never seen like New Jersey on TV in that way.
[33:57.15]I never saw the Jersey Shore either.
[34:00.20]I remember, Polk, I actually was at a friend's house and everyone was like, all right, we're going to watch this new show called Jersey Shore now.
[34:07.37]We watched the first episode.
[34:08.71]That's all I've ever seen of that show.
[34:11.10]I used to watch it with my friends.
[34:13.22]Who would you like, Snookum?
[34:15.93]Uh, the one big guy without the crazy hair.
[34:21.38]Dude, not the situation guy.
[34:23.58]Gotcha.
[34:24.22]Dude, the next time we plan on playing, whenever we plan on playing a game together again, we need to have separate, uh, individual kind of on-camera interviews where we're sitting in a chair, and during while we play the game, it needs to cut to, like, us talking about the us playing when we did, like, interview style.
[34:44.59]Right now, your interview would be like, I don't know what these guys are talking about, but I want nothing to do with this.
[34:49.01]Exactly.
[34:49.55]It would have just cut to me, and I would have leaned in and been like, huh?
[34:57.18]Do we pre-record these streams?
[35:01.10]I could totally 100% commit to this joke and just have a whole bunch of stream buttons to switch to my interview.
[35:08.28]I think it's worth exploring.
[35:12.42]I'm on board.
[35:14.48]Why don't we pre-record a stream and then just all stream it and just talk about it?
[35:20.58]That's fine.
[35:22.40]Developer commentary.
[35:25.11]Oh, this is the part where Jerma called in the orbital.
[35:27.45]It was so funny.
[35:28.59]Yeah.
[35:29.47]We all loved it.
[35:33.11]What happens if you are under the ship?
[35:35.53]Oh, you don't die.
[35:36.85]You think anyone would laugh?
[35:38.23]Depends.
[35:41.32]I would definitely laugh.
[35:42.26]I would laugh at that for sure.
[35:48.41]And then one of us has to... There has to be some drama, right?
[35:51.31]So, like, one of us has to be really annoyed with one of us.
[35:53.99]So, when I drop the orbital, like, I don't know, Vinny, you could cut to you doing the thing where you put your thumb and your middle finger on the bridge of your nose, leaning down, pushing, going like... Oh, like Jim...
[36:10.15]And you'd be like, he does this all the time.
[36:11.63]And everybody could have a reaction to me doing that and how not funny it was.
[36:15.29]And I'm sitting there cracking up and we cut to me and I'm like fucking nailed it every time, man.
[36:23.14]Yeah, I'm down for some bad bits.
[36:26.36]I like it.
[36:27.94]We could be the office.
[36:29.44]Which one of us would be Michael Scott?
[36:30.81]I'm so Jim.
[36:34.53]I don't think I've seen enough episodes of that show to know who I would be.
[36:38.05]I think you're Dwayne.
[36:40.21]Oh, no, I am not.
[36:41.39]No, I know.
[36:42.47]Wait, me arguing this much about it means I'm Dwayne.
[36:44.89]So I'm going to step back.
[36:45.95]His name isn't Dwayne.
[36:50.72]Dwight.
[36:51.76]That was the Dwayne reaction right there, if I've ever heard one.
[36:55.88]Oh, whoops.
[36:56.32]All right.
[36:56.76]Well, I don't watch the show.
[36:58.20]I don't know.
[37:00.06]I'm Pam.
[37:00.62]I'm such a Pam.
[37:02.04]I'm Pam.
[37:03.08]You're Pam coded.
[37:10.58]I gotta chill, man.
[37:12.16]I just gotta look into the camera.
[37:17.68]I think Jim's a bad person and a homewrecker.
[37:22.14]Have you seen the office?
[37:23.44]Yeah.
[37:24.36]Oh, then yeah, you know what's up.
[37:25.56]Yeah.
[37:25.96]It's been a while.
[37:28.84]Wait, is that a veiled attack on my character?
[37:34.57]Don't answer that.
[37:35.13]Wait.
[37:38.99]So where do we buy guns?
[37:42.80]You played this game.
[37:43.50]You got max level.
[37:44.26]You're smurfing.
[37:44.94]I'm not.
[37:45.68]Help us.
[37:47.26]War bonds.
[37:48.72]You lie.
[37:50.86]War bonds.
[37:52.88]You have three war bonds.
[37:55.36]So you won't be getting a gun for a while.
[37:57.14]But you have... Why is this Windows 8?
[38:07.07]Everything is going to be Windows 8 now.
[38:08.71]I see we do need a lot of war bonds.
[38:14.49]We got 3.
[38:14.75]15 gets it OK.
[38:20.53]I see.
[38:20.91]All right.
[38:28.08]L diaper.
[38:28.36]Do we get more people on a higher difficulty?
[38:35.71]maybe well yeah it's kind of like tutorialing us so we just unlocked medium difficulty all right we're getting plus one permission uh we can't get hard you you think we were ready gamers for medium yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah stir I'm letting you take the reins here because you you are max level you know what's up I mean I'm really just trying my best to hold this all together and tell us that there's a map and all that I think we're doing fine
[39:11.17]I'm a little pissed off, but I think we're fine.
[39:13.63]Why are you so mad?
[39:14.87]Whatever.
[39:18.29]Was it because he called you George?
[39:21.59]Whatever.
[39:24.11]Oh, that would be a perfect time to cut to you, your interview, talking about something Stir did.
[39:28.29]Yeah, I don't know what's going on with the group lately.
[39:31.02]It's just like... The vibes are just off.
[39:34.86]What does he mean?
[39:35.78]Green bean or potato?
[39:37.42]What is that?
[39:40.75]Jump complete.
[39:42.41]I'm just here for the ad.
[39:50.38]I tried to do it before you clicked on it.
[39:54.34]Alright, I have to go into the tube.
[39:59.12]Um... What do you guys think?
[40:02.93]Where are we dropping?
[40:04.27]Search and destroy.
[40:05.21]Uh...
[40:10.33]I think these are robots and you might have to destroy them by throwing grenades in the roof.
[40:15.91]I'm not sure.
[40:19.25]But, you know, my max level character knows what to do.
[40:23.17]Somebody said that's very green bean of you, dude.
[40:28.65]It's very Dwayne of you.
[40:34.11]Uh-oh.
[40:36.35]Uh-oh.
[40:39.07]green bean or uh potatoes are more versatile I'd be a potato everybody says that and it's wrong why is it wrong okay no one thinks about when you have a green bean and you you put two fingers at the top of it you squeeze one finger down and all the green beans come out of the bottom how satisfying would that feel yeah they actually make like uh toys that do that like what the fuck stem toys but you are the green bean
[41:09.19]Wait, what happened here?
[41:11.11]Hey guys, check this out.
[41:13.78]Watch this.
[41:18.66]That looks kind of fun.
[41:19.24]You ragdoll if you dive from too high, it's fun.
[41:26.24]I noticed quite a bit of your health is missing.
[41:28.80]Oh, it is taking a lot of health, that's right.
[41:35.51]P4, how do you turn your flashlight on at all times like that?
[41:40.33]uh wait how do you open the gun menu I forgot I forgot to hold r I've been told it's a cool menu like mouse wheel yeah 50 what is this auto on on auto oh okay right click changes to semi burst auto
[42:11.00]That's a really weird system.
[42:12.22]It's scroll down for the bottom menu, scroll up for the top menu, and right click for the right menu.
[42:18.10]I found a weapon.
[42:18.88]That's weird.
[42:19.98]It's a little strange, but whatever.
[42:23.53]You did find a weapon.
[42:24.41]What is that?
[42:25.95]A shotgun.
[42:30.15]I got a shotgun, guys.
[42:33.92]Was I supposed to put my arm in that guy's chest and steal an organ?
[42:38.02]Yeah.
[42:39.28]Alright.
[42:39.80]Extra experience.
[42:40.72]Extra EXP.
[42:41.84]Yeah, yeah.
[42:42.24]You freed him.
[42:43.30]Cool.
[42:44.76]Alright.
[42:45.36]Let's go around the round table here.
[42:47.51]What do you call the thing that you get for killing enemies?
[42:51.75]The thing you collect.
[42:52.53]The resource you collect.
[42:53.43]What is it?
[42:54.15]What do you call it?
[42:54.75]XP.
[42:55.65]Okay.
[42:59.45]Ganymite.
[43:01.15]Points.
[43:02.11]Points?
[43:02.31]That's not real.
[43:04.61]I say experience.
[43:05.85]You say XP.
[43:06.62]Does anybody say EXP?
[43:08.72]No.
[43:10.03]No, you gain EXP, but you don't collect EXP.
[43:12.61]That's just stupid.
[43:14.57]Oh, shit!
[43:16.73]Are they shooting?
[43:18.01]Wait, these things are like robots.
[43:24.56]Yeah.
[43:27.12]It just looks like Dermot doesn't listen to us when we talk about it earlier.
[43:31.46]Yeah, I really feel like I'm just done talking to him.
[43:40.42]I love how you had to jump in and say that.
[43:45.51]I love it.
[43:49.61]I really want to do the bit.
[43:50.43]We should do it.
[43:51.81]I would do it.
[43:52.35]Minor place of interest.
[43:54.78]I don't understand how the bit logistically works.
[43:57.18]It's very easy without without a lot of like editing and post a lot of planning.
[44:01.48]It's it's just and honestly I didn't I don't even care if it's on my stream just has to go on one of our streams and somebody just has to just be the tech director like the switcher.
[44:12.22]Kraken could do the tech part.
[44:16.40]I don't know.
[44:18.10]Get him involved.
[44:20.28]You press the ball.
[44:21.00]This is the Jurassic Park.
[44:24.11]for robots.
[44:37.68]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[44:42.96]This, oh.
[44:45.31]I'm going around like Jesus.
[44:47.45]What?
[44:48.09]What are you talking about?
[44:48.99]I didn't do anything.
[44:50.19]Killed by combo meal.
[44:51.79]How?
[44:52.25]I'll take that shotgun.
[44:54.69]I threw a grenade over there.
[44:56.51]Wait, anyone with a shotgun?
[44:57.53]Where's it?
[44:59.75]Oh, wait, it's not.
[45:00.37]Is it on?
[45:00.61]Is it on?
[45:01.10]I have it on.
[45:01.48]Okay.
[45:02.44]I got you.
[45:02.88]Let me get him.
[45:03.40]I killed him.
[45:12.74]Oh man, I didn't mean that.
[45:13.82]I want the shotgun.
[45:14.48]Where's the shotgun?
[45:15.28]I didn't mean it.
[45:16.84]Just because I didn't mean to do it doesn't mean I don't want the cool item here.
[45:19.80]You can have it back.
[45:20.52]It's on the ground.
[45:21.38]It just sounds like there was no remorse.
[45:23.92]Reloading.
[45:28.79]Area secured.
[45:30.55]Well, everything blew up over there.
[45:31.99]That was very I did that.
[45:34.25]That was stressful.
[45:43.08]All right, that's right.
[45:46.15]Let's go.
[45:47.79]I stayed in a Point Pleasant hotel with my family when I was young.
[45:53.53]It was called the Gangplank Hotel.
[46:00.04]Thanks, guys.
[46:04.13]I don't know, things just explode and then the fucking Marvel music plays.
[46:07.89]We may need reinforcements.
[46:10.66]Oh my god, there's like 700 bots.
[46:12.38]I just saw you.
[46:13.50]Ow!
[46:16.20]They have katanas!
[46:17.96]Oh, I thought that was somebody.
[46:21.76]Oh, I'm died.
[46:22.52]I thought that was somebody.
[46:23.58]I'm died.
[46:24.69]So we're medium gamers.
[46:27.07]Enough jokes, huh?
[46:29.39]No, we got this.
[46:30.41]We got this.
[46:32.05]We come back with full ammo too, right?
[46:35.38]no uh some ammo I just made so many funny noises I thought the guy that killed me with the melee was one of you throwing a grenade
[47:04.07]Yeah, those always-on lights are a little... They get a little stroby.
[47:09.98]I'll turn mine off.
[47:11.12]I'm going to do auto for mine.
[47:15.28]It's not a bad idea.
[47:16.96]What is down here?
[47:17.62]Okay.
[47:17.90]Oh, it's only when you aim.
[47:18.96]Okay.
[47:19.82]Sample.
[47:24.03]We got two more of these to blow up.
[47:33.09]I found... these don't look good.
[47:36.79]Uh, they look like mines.
[47:42.03]Yep, I knew that was gonna happen.
[47:44.01]Uh, then we have five minutes left.
[47:46.98]Oh shit, we do only have five minutes, we gotta go.
[47:49.88]Guys!
[47:50.60]Oh shit!
[47:54.38]Uh... I don't think they're on the map.
[47:57.64]I think we just have to find them.
[47:58.74]Find them?
[48:02.96]Is this the whole map?
[48:03.68]It looks like we're getting more visibility.
[48:06.04]Well, I can see the extraction zone, but that's... I just see places of interest.
[48:13.96]That's it.
[48:14.38]Yeah.
[48:23.19]Oh, you can find requisition slips in the mission.
[48:29.88]I think on the map we have like resource areas we can go to.
[48:35.37]If you're quick.
[48:35.91]If you're quick with it.
[48:37.59]Why am I crouching?
[48:45.54]Found something.
[48:47.30]Samples.
[48:50.54]I don't know what that did.
[48:55.80]Now cut to my perspective.
[48:59.70]It's funny.
[49:00.18]It's not funny when I do it, but it's funny when he does it.
[49:03.78]I don't know what I did.
[49:04.88]I don't know what you died to.
[49:06.39]Yeah, I don't know either.
[49:08.29]That was weird.
[49:09.15]Because everybody was over there.
[49:12.51]I got hit by three things.
[49:14.03]I got blown up by one thing and then another explosion killed me.
[49:16.57]I don't know what it was.
[49:17.21]I don't know.
[49:18.97]I don't remember how to throw stratagems.
[49:20.89]Oh, you got this.
[49:21.43]Sorry.
[49:23.11]You hold control and you have to do directions.
[49:25.12]Oh, right.
[49:25.56]Control.
[49:26.02]Yeah, I'll get it eventually.
[49:29.58]Thank you.
[49:29.96]Appreciate it.
[49:31.60]Point me to the enemy.
[49:40.11]I like the atmosphere in this game so far, though.
[49:43.85]It's got some cool environment.
[49:46.69]Oh, I see where it is on the map.
[49:48.90]We have to go to this red area up here.
[49:51.18]Three minutes, guys.
[49:52.64]We got it.
[49:54.22]Double time this.
[49:56.00]Yo, what the hell?
[49:57.98]Wait, how do you talk like that?
[50:01.51]There's AT-ATs.
[50:02.61]You buy a GoXLR.
[50:05.19]Oh, I have one of those.
[50:05.89]Oh, there is an AT-AT.
[50:11.79]A legally distinct one.
[50:13.38]Right.
[50:15.44]You can't kill it with bullet.
[50:17.06]You have to shoot a grenade.
[50:18.84]Oh, there's one of those bases on the hill below us.
[50:21.08]I'm going to call the orbital.
[50:23.14]What is my gun?
[50:23.86]What am I shooting?
[50:25.97]You guys see this?
[50:27.35]Oh, I think I fucked it up.
[50:31.38]C2, check this out!
[50:34.08]Woah.
[50:34.44]Oh no.
[50:35.52]Oh god.
[50:39.84]I'm not gonna lie, I feel like a fucking stormtrooper right now.
[50:42.10]Like, I just feel like I'm not even doing anything.
[50:46.50]Where is it coming from?
[50:47.68]We're being shot from behind a wall.
[50:49.95]Yeah, what the?
[50:50.97]There's a turret in the wall.
[50:52.27]What the fuck?
[50:53.45]Oh, it's the chicken walker.
[50:54.59]It's the AT-ST.
[50:55.47]It's in the wall.
[50:57.81]Uh, should we orb?
[50:58.65]Wait, guys, we only have two minutes to get out of here.
[51:02.69]We gotta leave it.
[51:06.43]I'm doing an orbital.
[51:07.39]I'm doing an orbital right here.
[51:08.39]There's a big group of robots.
[51:14.53]We have a minute and 35 seconds.
[51:20.47]I got to find the other thing to blow up quickly.
[51:26.10]I think we lost.
[51:26.72]There's some red over here.
[51:28.52]I got the one over here.
[51:30.62]They're all on the map.
[51:31.42]It's the red zones.
[51:34.18]If you could just sprint over to the red zone.
[51:36.68]Just throw grenades.
[51:37.84]Throw a orbital when you get there.
[51:39.66]Hold control.
[51:40.25]Do orbital.
[51:40.73]Throw it right in the middle of the base.
[51:43.35]Got it.
[51:44.65]You don't lose just no more stratagems.
[51:46.53]That's what I'm being told by the chat.
[51:49.05]We might be able to get it, though.
[51:54.90]How close do you have to be?
[51:55.88]Oh, tab is the map.
[51:58.20]Oh.
[51:59.02]And then you can zoom, uh, hold right click to look around.
[52:01.58]Is that close enough?
[52:10.26]Um, it probably would be a good time before the timer runs out to resupply.
[52:14.32]Oh, we got it, we got it.
[52:15.86]No, we didn't.
[52:24.73]Oh, I'm in trouble here.
[52:27.13]Trying to provide some some help.
[52:31.67]I'm OK.
[52:38.34]How do we blow this up?
[52:40.00]Shoot it or just kill everything coming up?
[52:41.74]You have to throw a grenade into the top of the building.
[52:44.30]It has like opening.
[52:46.76]I'm throwing an orbital in this base.
[52:47.96]Watch it poke poke.
[52:48.92]It's in there.
[52:54.91]We get no more reinforcements.
[52:56.93]Yeah, so be careful.
[52:59.13]Oh, you're actually dead.
[53:00.75]I looked over at chat and then I turned over and my body was in five pieces.
[53:05.76]What happened?
[53:06.44]It was a landmine?
[53:09.08]I don't know what the ping button is.
[53:20.31]Supplies here if anyone needs them.
[53:23.17]I'm gonna die.
[53:27.06]I'm so gonna die.
[53:34.62]Alright, they got it.
[53:40.95]This machine gun is very floaty.
[53:44.83]I don't even know what that means.
[53:46.43]No, I don't know what that means either.
[53:50.33]Ah, waste of a grenade.
[53:51.15]Why did I do that?
[53:52.67]Hey, Ster.
[53:54.65]Turns out I am a potato.
[53:57.33]I changed my answer.
[53:58.68]Why?
[53:58.90]I just changed my answer.
[54:02.38]Okay, why?
[54:03.26]We got this, Vinny.
[54:07.04]We got it.
[54:07.42]Did you see how the roof of that building has like two fires coming out?
[54:12.63]You gotta throw a grenade in there.
[54:16.43]I miss.
[54:19.20]I'll try to get one in there.
[54:20.26]Hang on.
[54:20.58]I missed every grenade.
[54:24.64]Okay, and you're going to want to back up once you get one in there.
[54:27.66]Watch out, Polk.
[54:29.80]Watch out.
[54:30.20]I think I got it in there.
[54:35.03]Got it.
[54:35.75]Why can't I watch what you guys are doing?
[54:39.29]Polk, are you dead?
[54:40.35]Yeah.
[54:40.95]Can you press A or D, Jerma, to switch?
[54:43.63]No.
[54:45.84]Where am I going?
[54:46.54]Where am I going?
[54:47.48]That beacon in the distance or where?
[54:49.88]Uh, you're the only one alive.
[54:51.96]You gotta check the map.
[54:54.18]I see it.
[54:54.82]Blue.
[54:55.62]Oh, shit.
[54:58.18]This music is way too intense and awesome for the camera angle of me looking at my torso.
[55:06.28]God, that recoil is awful.
[55:09.18]Is Jervis' camera just his body?
[55:11.50]My camera's just my body and it's just staring at my torso.
[55:14.10]I don't have limbs.
[55:14.96]I don't have a head.
[55:15.46]I don't have a neck.
[55:16.28]I'm just, I'm a potato.
[55:17.28]That's why I changed my answer.
[55:18.72]Oh.
[55:20.97]What happened?
[55:21.91]What happened?
[55:22.65]Oh, no.
[55:23.07]Oh, I pressed the wrong button.
[55:24.83]Shift plus tab doesn't work because it goes into the Steam UI.
[55:28.15]Steam UI.
[55:28.77]I want to see what's happening.
[55:30.09]I can't see anything.
[55:30.99]Wait, we won.
[55:33.81]No, it left without him.
[55:39.10]This is like what you guys do to me in Lethal Comfort.
[55:42.06]Mission complete.
[55:45.40]I mean, we didn't extract, but we completed the mission.
[55:49.38]We got zero stars.
[55:51.76]Yeah, that sucks, actually.
[55:57.45]I had fun on that one.
[55:58.21]I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[56:00.59]I think the game is fun.
[56:02.87]Yeah, it's alright.
[56:03.53]I'm enjoying it.
[56:04.83]It's nice and smooth.
[56:08.12]I was told that you have to crouch with the machine gun, just as a good piece of advice for you lads.
[56:14.98]Or you could lay down as a prone.
[56:17.84]I'm laying down right now while playing this.
[56:19.40]I'm just like completely flat on the ground.
[56:21.92]Oh, that's so awesome.
[56:24.36]On your belly?
[56:24.94]Mm-hmm.
[56:26.84]Do you have a scope to see your monitor in the distance?
[56:30.40]Yeah, I have a periscope, yeah.
[56:33.91]you know stir short for sternum stirrup check the armory there's cool guns that require two people to fire says a chat member what I don't know what that means but we can where's the armory what do you mean armory oh that's literally right there okay I'm cool I only have one gun I can use yeah is there
[57:01.27]Are we certain that there's no other way to get these guns besides these war bombs?
[57:06.70]I don't know.
[57:19.47]I'm going to accidentally buy one of these emotes and it's going to make me so mad.
[57:22.37]I already know it.
[57:26.47]Ship upgrade computer check the other ship PC in the hell.
[57:30.38]Yeah, I saw that yeah War bonds, I might buy a weapon now.
[57:36.06]Let's see five Shotgun is available for five if anyone wants that that seems like a decent choice.
[57:46.57]Oh
[57:50.03]Where are you seeing guns?
[57:52.06]Press R and then... Yeah.
[57:55.74]Oh, guys, I am buying the rocket launcher.
[58:00.94]And I'm the worst one of the group to use it, but I don't care.
[58:06.46]How much is it?
[58:07.90]I got $3,800.
[58:08.19]I'm getting it.
[58:16.86]the terminals to the left of the armory one have stratagem unlocks I'm being told yeah there's not much yet because we do got a level this thing only shoots one time and then it is a battle pass uh it's a fake battle pass but yeah it looks it doesn't it yeah Chad I want this gun this revolver it looks awesome I'm gonna save my money
[58:45.77]Where do I... Oh, it's a stratagem, right?
[58:49.15]Is the shotgun worth it?
[58:52.13]Blue war bonds you have to pay for.
[58:54.13]Yeah, that's that I figured.
[58:55.37]I'll be staying far away from that.
[58:57.00]Flamethrower?
[59:01.28]Oh my god.
[59:02.16]I call flamethrower.
[59:09.04]No rebuttal?
[59:13.27]I want the marksman rifle.
[59:18.68]It's a very weird UI.
[59:19.76]Yeah, yeah, I'm not crazy about it.
[59:25.99]So these are you call these in?
[59:29.39]Yeah.
[59:33.83]So.
[59:36.32]What is the?
[59:37.36]Are we going to get more stuff in the loadout menu or like actual weapons rather than calling in weapons?
[59:44.34]Yeah, that's what these are in the beginning when you select your call-ins.
[59:47.18]Yeah.
[59:50.28]And it's a different currency, too.
[59:53.06]Anti-personnel minefield looks awesome.
[59:58.38]Holy shit, I'm getting that.
[60:00.76]There's a lot if you scroll down, like, other orbital strikes, orbital gas strikes, and there's, like, bombing runs.
[60:06.64]There's a lot of... There's a sentry that'll just shoot for you, too.
[60:11.63]I like that.
[60:12.11]I'm gonna get the sentry.
[60:15.66]Wait, sentry sounds crazy.
[60:18.34]Yeah, I got the sentry and I got the mine launcher that's going to kill all of us.
[60:23.21]That looks like a guaranteed way for us to die.
[60:32.07]Level 5.
[60:33.19]Ooh, this is a jump pack.
[60:34.69]This is a jet pack.
[60:35.45]That's cool.
[60:36.57]Level 8.
[60:36.91]I'm going to save some money.
[60:43.38]chat is there any way to change the yellow on the costumes to green like how much real money do I have to spend for that oh it's like 60 bucks let's say I don't know if you go to your armor the armory I think there's some that you just have let's see there's like a blue one they look all the same
[61:08.44]Should I get this thing?
[61:09.89]This Punisher?
[61:10.53]There is a difference between heavy armor.
[61:13.43]There's a heavy armor you can equip.
[61:25.37]How do you do heavy armor?
[61:26.41]I did not pre-order.
[61:27.80]It's at the bottom of the armor menu.
[61:29.48]Oh, I see.
[61:30.60]Wait, no, I don't have that.
[61:32.16]Because you pre-ordered?
[61:32.96]Shotgun's good.
[61:34.96]Oh, I might have it because I...
[61:37.04]Uh-huh.
[61:37.40]Yeah, you smurfed.
[61:38.34]That's why.
[61:38.88]You were smurfing.
[61:39.90]I just bought it before it came out.
[61:42.20]Smurfing like Gargamel.
[61:45.51]He always does this.
[61:46.41]Every game we play.
[61:48.89]I really do.
[61:49.49]I really do this every game we play.
[61:52.43]I'm saving my medals.
[61:56.08]Yeah, chat, that button doesn't work.
[61:58.98]The C and Z button.
[62:01.04]I only have those four pieces of armor, so C and Z is not working.
[62:06.76]Okay, we can do the medium mission.
[62:09.00]The Twitch drop is green.
[62:11.64]Do I get my own Twitch drop if I enable that?
[62:13.86]No.
[62:15.16]Open your own stream.
[62:16.72]I'm just going to open your stream, Stir, or Germa, or Poke.
[62:20.00]That's it.
[62:20.65]Got this.
[62:21.35]Wait, I don't have drops on it.
[62:23.47]Yeah, I don't have it either.
[62:24.43]I don't know how to do that.
[62:25.21]I don't think I've ever done drops on Twitch.
[62:27.11]I don't know what that means.
[62:29.59]It means if you're connected, your account through Twitch, with whatever game it is, watching a stream that has that enabled will give you items in the game.
[62:40.77]That was very informative, Jeremiah.
[62:43.03]I did for Cyberpunk?
[62:44.17]Oh, I did?
[62:46.77]Do you get like an exclusive glitch for the Cyberpunk one?
[62:54.37]You have a strategic eye.
[62:56.81]Dwayne, I don't think I don't think I'll ever get over that one.
[63:02.43]People are going to call me Dwayne now from now on.
[63:04.99]Thanks a lot, stir.
[63:08.00]No problem, Dwayne.
[63:09.40]I'm confused.
[63:10.06]It says we have a currently active operation.
[63:12.26]40 minutes.
[63:25.01]Getting your pods.
[63:31.42]Oh, that's what it meant.
[63:33.30]Oh my god, we're moving so fast.
[63:36.12]I went in my pod and then out of my pod.
[63:37.88]Oh, that was cool.
[63:40.69]Yeah, we're not podding yet.
[63:41.79]I gotta pick the world.
[63:43.93]Now this is pod racing.
[63:45.93]I'm confused.
[63:49.17]You ever think
[63:54.54]Is this world?
[63:55.44]Yeah.
[63:56.92]Yeah.
[63:59.08]Remember when we were just Earth?
[64:01.12]Like grains of sand on a beach.
[64:03.54]I miss my hometown.
[64:06.66]Me too.
[64:07.76]Wait, are you reciting lyrics to Elton John?
[64:12.20]Are we?
[64:12.38]I don't know.
[64:16.42]What if I don't pot up?
[64:20.42]Wait, where's one for me?
[64:30.84]What the hell was that noise?
[64:36.17]Oh, I don't know.
[64:37.21]That was nice.
[64:39.09]I got my rocket launcher.
[64:40.33]I can't.
[64:40.89]Oh my God.
[64:41.27]Someone's going to blow up this game.
[64:42.63]Look at that.
[64:44.47]I got some extra ordnance.
[64:48.37]Oh, you do have some stuff.
[64:49.77]Yeah.
[64:51.65]Before I drop that mine thrower, we all have to be really far away from it though.
[64:56.52]So I'll let you guys know ahead of time.
[64:59.22]communication is is good for a marriage okay so that's like now tell me what was your parents marriage like back in point pleasant at the buckaroo bay I was gonna say at the gangplank hotel that's the name of a gang it was it was like a crack den it was disgusting they had no idea because they booked it ahead of time so we got there and like at night they actually put the couch in front of the door
[65:28.00]Oh my god.
[65:28.74]Woah.
[65:29.26]You definitely call that the gangplank.
[65:31.79]I had a Wildwood hotel experience where I was at this place called Aqua Beach, and, Ster, I'm not saying this to make funnies on the stream, this is real.
[65:41.53]There was a poop rag in a glass, like, tunnel connecting two buildings, and my cousin and I called it Shit Rag Alley.
[65:50.79]And that was like a little meme for years, and it was a disgusting hotel, and it probably had bedbugs.
[65:59.28]no I mean again I believe you because the gangplank I'm sure there was the shit rag alley it was on that level I just pretty mean what do you mean by a shit rag can you explain that it was uh it was it was a washcloth with poop on it oh ew I think we gotta call an orbital on this thing oh what do I do with this I'm so sorry I got a gigantic missile
[66:25.53]What should I do with this?
[66:26.17]We have to destroy this air thing.
[66:27.75]Can you do that?
[66:29.29]Can you put the missile in it?
[66:30.26]I don't know, maybe?
[66:31.36]There's a receptacle.
[66:33.70]There is a receptacle.
[66:34.46]Okay, watch out.
[66:35.18]Ammo in.
[66:37.90]There's one shot in there.
[66:42.68]Tactically finding another ammo.
[66:44.84]Can we run away?
[66:46.92]We need four more of those before we complete the mission.
[66:50.93]We need four more missiles.
[66:52.07]Yeah, we gotta load four.
[66:52.97]Oh, right here.
[66:55.46]Nice, dude.
[66:57.40]Okay.
[66:58.02]I wonder if they're all around here.
[66:59.24]Go pick one up, Yash.
[67:05.42]I'm pressing Q and it's not pulsing my whole screen, turning my screen slightly blue and illuminating every object I can pick up.
[67:13.62]What the fuck is going on here?
[67:15.10]Why is it... I don't get it.
[67:20.39]What does that mean?
[67:23.13]V3.
[67:24.63]What do I do with this?
[67:25.39]Good old V3.
[67:25.61]You put it over here.
[67:28.05]I ran past one.
[67:29.05]Over here.
[67:29.39]Over here, V3.
[67:30.19]Where are you?
[67:30.67]Who are you?
[67:31.07]Oh, you're S1.
[67:31.87]Sorry.
[67:33.31]Oh.
[67:36.29]Valuable time wasted.
[67:39.09]I got one here.
[67:39.79]Okay, use terminal.
[67:45.88]You gotta wait till it's all loaded.
[67:47.40]Wait.
[67:47.98]Wait, what?
[67:48.30]I just wasted a heal.
[67:51.88]Why am I holding one still?
[67:53.85]I don't know it looks like a giant makeup um I'm sorry I thought I had to click left click to do the terminal I was sadly mistaken did that do a lot of damage to you poke do what yeah oh my god I'm so sorry
[68:17.68]Oh, you punched me?
[68:19.04]I shot you.
[68:20.88]Guys, how do you tag a location?
[68:25.57]Q, Q, Q, Q. We can use it as a stratagem now, apparently.
[68:29.69]Because it's loaded.
[68:33.03]Wait, respond to what?
[68:34.03]I'm hoping that grenade hits.
[68:45.64]Probably didn't.
[68:48.38]Oh, this enemy does not want to die with bullets.
[68:53.40]Not really have the rocket launcher.
[68:56.70]Yes, I have the rocket launcher.
[68:58.31]Hold on, I have to play dance dance revolution to get a fucking item.
[69:03.57]Give me a second.
[69:05.49]Be careful, careful, careful, careful over there.
[69:09.38]That's one dude.
[69:10.54]He's so mad.
[69:12.24]Alright, I got it.
[69:13.86]You just hey, there's like three of these by the way.
[69:16.42]Somebody grab one.
[69:17.80]Definitely crouch before shooting.
[69:20.00]Otherwise it is a mess.
[69:23.73]Oh, that's a rocket launcher.
[69:24.69]Well, even then probably want to crouch.
[69:26.11]Yeah, that that has one shot in it and it is devastating.
[69:29.75]So just be very careful.
[69:30.77]I'm throwing an orbital up here into this base.
[69:36.93]I think.
[69:39.83]Oh, man.
[69:41.55]I'm a little confused.
[69:43.21]I'm going to test it on this thing.
[69:45.41]Yeah, probably test it on that thing.
[69:47.13]I'm going to test it.
[69:47.71]Everyone back up.
[69:49.11]Back away from the AT-ST.
[69:52.87]P4.
[69:53.15]Okay, careful.
[69:55.25]I like how you're trying to melee it.
[69:56.98]I was.
[69:57.76]I think I got it.
[69:58.14]That's pretty cool.
[69:58.62]All right, that kills it instantly, but there's only one shot.
[70:03.30]I think grenades also work, but I ran out of grenades.
[70:13.32]Oh, gee.
[70:16.26]Morty.
[70:17.20]Why did that just do it to me?
[70:18.40]I don't know why.
[70:20.44]Oh, gee.
[70:21.14]Oh, Rick.
[70:22.52]Oh, gee, Rick.
[70:23.16]I don't know about this.
[70:27.10]Oh, no.
[70:27.62]Morty.
[70:28.93]A rake situation.
[70:30.75]You guys have grenades?
[70:37.75]I have no grenades.
[70:40.57]I...
[70:41.95]Now it's go- oh!
[70:43.89]Oh, go woo woo!
[70:45.63]Yeah.
[70:46.61]We gotta destroy this dropship.
[70:49.63]I got this, how?
[70:51.21]Can we- you got a missile launcher?
[70:53.93]Uh, somebody does.
[70:54.45]No, right here, right here, this.
[70:57.75]I got it.
[71:00.95]Why did I fall down from that?
[71:02.67]Nobody else did.
[71:03.33]I fell down.
[71:04.85]Polk, no!
[71:06.52]I'm the only fucking one!
[71:10.33]Oh shit, we got some trouble in the distance.
[71:12.15]I'm going to turret them.
[71:18.49]This gun is very hard to hit with.
[71:20.91]Do I resupply if I'm going to die?
[71:25.65]I'm going to take a machine gun, maybe?
[71:27.09]I don't know.
[71:28.35]I'm going to resupply coming in.
[71:29.13]Resupply coming in.
[71:29.57]Machine guns coming in.
[71:30.23]Load them up.
[71:38.63]Who put the mine thing?
[71:40.03]Not me.
[71:42.91]I've been on the turret.
[71:46.37]I can't see any enemies, dude.
[71:48.86]I got to turn the fog off.
[71:56.94]Throwing artillery in the distance there.
[71:58.60]No.
[72:02.66]What just happened?
[72:03.16]I was going to tell you don't go there.
[72:05.14]I mean, you already blew it up.
[72:07.29]I thought it was going to be pretty safe.
[72:08.47]I didn't know what that was.
[72:09.83]It looked like drinkable.
[72:11.87]It looked like Gatorades.
[72:14.89]Reinforcing.
[72:15.91]All right, reinforce.
[72:16.77]Okay, okay.
[72:18.03]Yeah, those are mines behind us.
[72:19.39]Those red things are mines.
[72:20.27]I'm all right.
[72:27.84]Oh, this is bad.
[72:28.54]This is bad, lads.
[72:29.80]We have to extract.
[72:30.64]We're just going to work our way towards extraction.
[72:34.08]Busters.
[72:37.04]What?
[72:38.72]Oh, boy.
[72:41.58]Can you guys see enemies?
[72:44.10]Yeah.
[72:45.59]I got a machine gun turret on the way.
[72:51.75]Oh, my God.
[73:00.51]Yeah, we need like anti-armor stuff.
[73:04.01]I don't know if my turret is going to do that.
[73:05.97]I don't know if my turret even worked.
[73:09.39]I'm calling in an orbital.
[73:11.39]Yep.
[73:11.79]Watch out.
[73:25.69]Give me the shit.
[73:26.19]Do bullets not work at all or do they just work very poorly?
[73:29.07]Very poorly.
[73:30.63]There's a pilot on the AT-STs, guys.
[73:32.67]I'm out.
[73:34.67]If you go behind the AT-ST, you can kill the pilot.
[73:39.53]It works.
[73:40.11]Holy shit.
[73:40.41]I was going to say, on the chainsaw arm guys, if you shoot their arms off, they lose their chainsaws and everything.
[73:50.12]We got to keep rotating.
[73:52.20]We got to get out of here.
[73:53.76]I'm following you, sir.
[73:55.32]There's a rocket launcher guy in here.
[73:59.22]If we take over this base, we can use its natural defenses to fortify our position.
[74:06.93]Are there mines?
[74:08.41]I got it.
[74:08.93]No, there's just a lot of mines everywhere.
[74:10.87]There are mines.
[74:11.37]There are mines.
[74:12.11]Watch it.
[74:12.41]Watch it.
[74:12.69]Watch it.
[74:12.97]Watch it.
[74:21.30]Melted.
[74:28.31]Move up!
[74:28.57]We gotta get out of here, guys!
[74:34.33]How do I rez them?
[74:35.63]I'm rezzing right now.
[74:41.80]I got you.
[74:42.58]I called an artillery.
[74:44.29]That might hit us.
[74:47.42]I'm here.
[74:47.86]I'm gonna get some, uh, robots with me.
[74:51.35]What the fuck was that?
[74:52.99]Holy shit.
[74:54.05]Dude, you wiped out the whole map.
[74:55.95]Oh, this is bad.
[74:57.43]Guys, this is bad.
[74:58.33]This is real bad.
[75:00.01]They're dropping the guys on us.
[75:01.83]What the fuck?
[75:02.75]Oh, I'm dead.
[75:03.77]Oh, no.
[75:05.01]Guys, this is not good.
[75:07.50]I called another orbital.
[75:08.58]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[75:09.48]Go, go, go, go, go.
[75:11.80]Call in a res on me.
[75:12.64]Call in a res on me.
[75:14.36]Um, um, um, um.
[75:16.84]I got it.
[75:18.99]I got an artillery strike coming in.
[75:23.39]I got the potato bug.
[75:24.73]You gotta res me.
[75:25.25]What do you mean we're outside the combat area?
[75:31.82]I put an orbital strike here, man.
[75:33.30]I think we might be in some trouble.
[75:37.28]Oh God.
[75:47.41]I created a minefield and it's pointless.
[75:49.35]I don't know why I did that.
[75:53.77]I think the bug missions would be easier until we get like guns that hurt robots.
[75:59.44]Yeah, we're we're yeah.
[76:01.22]I'll just keep running towards the exit.
[76:07.02]I got an orbital strike.
[76:08.90]I'm going to throw it.
[76:09.92]I'm just going to throw it behind us like at them.
[76:13.13]Keep going.
[76:14.05]V3 be careful.
[76:15.23]There is an orbital strike.
[76:26.04]I'm out of ammo.
[76:30.00]Did you put a bomb there?
[76:32.84]I put them there a while ago.
[76:35.76]Those are the red dots.
[76:37.03]Stay in there.
[76:37.55]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:38.23]They're coming around.
[76:38.91]They're going to step on the mines.
[76:40.11]This is good.
[76:42.65]Well, I think I killed the mines.
[76:43.63]I have no ammo.
[76:44.65]Oh, you killed some of them.
[76:45.83]Oh, my God.
[76:46.93]Rocket launcher over here.
[76:48.37]I got a rocket launcher over here.
[76:49.97]It's a single shot.
[76:50.53]Got one.
[76:51.73]If someone can res me again, I'm a potato.
[76:54.19]I will res.
[76:55.21]Thank you.
[76:55.70]Okay, good.
[76:56.86]Wasted that.
[76:57.36]That's cool.
[76:57.70]All right, I will res.
[76:58.72]Hang on.
[76:59.20]Res.
[76:59.74]Where's the res?
[77:00.56]I called Orbit all over the hill.
[77:02.12]Oh.
[77:04.68]Poke, you're going to be back in a minute.
[77:06.84]Thank you.
[77:10.76]We have 14 reses.
[77:11.72]That's actually... That's a lot.
[77:13.42]Oh, my God.
[77:14.32]That hit me in the face.
[77:21.12]Can you reduce the fog?
[77:22.74]I don't know.
[77:23.62]I hope so.
[77:27.66]I don't think we can... I just... I just got here.
[77:30.49]You're standing in the open.
[77:33.57]It was a rocket though.
[77:34.65]Why is... Did it pick you guys?
[77:36.11]Just me.
[77:36.61]I'm dead too.
[77:37.59]Well, I'm behind a rock.
[77:38.89]Yeah, I know.
[77:42.05]Gotcha.
[77:44.27]Where's the fog button?
[77:51.62]There's so many.
[77:53.53]Got my machine gun inbound.
[77:54.99]My bazooka.
[77:58.85]Oh, here it is.
[78:02.01]Ow.
[78:07.47]Dude, war is crazy.
[78:09.63]Oh, it's insane.
[78:14.38]Oh, my.
[78:15.48]We got to keep moving.
[78:18.10]Is that blue laser?
[78:19.74]They just keep dropping them.
[78:27.36]Do we gotta go to that blue laser?
[78:28.82]Yeah.
[78:29.72]Whoa.
[78:30.14]I think we have to go around this water.
[78:33.02]Can we go through?
[78:33.99]Do you drown and die?
[78:35.81]You cannot swim.
[78:37.15]You can't... Wait, yeah, you can.
[78:37.99]You can swim.
[78:38.37]No, you can't.
[78:41.45]We all figured that out at the same time.
[78:42.89]Weapon.
[78:43.29]Oh, I think we just... Oh, no.
[78:44.45]Too bad.
[78:52.47]Oh.
[78:53.65]Did I...
[78:55.72]Oh, shit.
[78:57.16]That wasn't me, right, chat?
[78:58.98]I killed poke.
[79:00.28]Oh, ow, ow, ow.
[79:01.54]No, I... Get out of the fucking water.
[79:04.26]It says, it says Wild Souls.
[79:06.92]It could be above... Oh, my God.
[79:09.34]That was the best shot of the game so far, and it was a TK.
[79:12.12]God damn it.
[79:12.70]Oh, God.
[79:13.16]Careful.
[79:13.60]I tried to do the reinforce thing, you know, the up, down, left, right, B, A, up, down, B, A, start.
[79:17.97]I didn't get it.
[79:25.38]We gotta run.
[79:26.57]There's a lull.
[79:27.65]We gotta go.
[79:41.42]Bugs are more suited.
[79:42.66]Yeah, we should be.
[79:44.30]Next mission.
[79:44.80]Maybe we'll kill some bugs.
[79:48.24]We can make it.
[79:53.51]Yeah, we can make it across these watch out.
[79:54.95]There's there's dudes on.
[80:04.26]Hey, that's not realistic.
[80:06.61]The robots go in the water.
[80:10.15]Wait, I think somebody... Did that work?
[80:16.12]Oh, no, we're good.
[80:16.72]Okay.
[80:17.94]My cloak kind of glitched, but I think I just drowned.
[80:21.66]Got you.
[80:22.78]That was pretty cool.
[80:26.32]Thank you, Jerma.
[80:31.06]For God's sake, someone put in the Konami code.
[80:35.17]That's a lot of enemies.
[80:36.45]That's a lot of enemies.
[80:37.55]I'm going to do anti-personnel mines.
[80:40.07]Keep running.
[80:40.49]They're behind us.
[80:41.61]Yeah, I'm going to put down some mines behind us.
[80:44.76]And a turret, maybe.
[80:45.98]No, we got a turret resupply.
[80:47.22]I'm leaving.
[80:48.22]Yeah, we're just leaving.
[80:49.88]I think this is dangerous for us to stay.
[80:51.78]Yep.
[80:52.06]Agreed.
[80:52.42]Agreed.
[80:57.07]War.
[80:59.83]War never changes.
[81:00.89]Hell lands.
[81:03.62]Can they drop a Porsche for us?
[81:08.48]A Warthog would be nice.
[81:12.97]Okay, two minutes.
[81:18.79]Two minutes.
[81:21.81]Boy, I wasted that minefield.
[81:23.29]That would have been real helpful.
[81:24.21]Do you have the auto turrets?
[81:25.51]The sentries?
[81:27.21]Throw some grenades, guys.
[81:28.75]I had a sentry.
[81:29.41]It's a minute cooldown, I think, from here.
[81:34.24]yeah one minute one minute I got an orbital precision strike though so uh you guys have those right where they are all right I think we're good we got a moment we got a moment do you waste legends or or use one they recharge so I would say wait until you need them
[82:11.85]Whole group right over here.
[82:13.62]14 seconds on that turret.
[82:26.16]I like how we're just shooting into smoke, not knowing what we're shooting at.
[82:28.80]I think I'm just... We're just stormtrooper-ing it up here and it's pretty... It's alright.
[82:38.25]There's a... They're landing over here.
[82:40.35]Machine gun on the way.
[82:52.34]They're over here on the next to the trees.
[82:54.02]10 seconds.
[82:56.18]All right.
[82:56.42]We got two AT-ATs.
[82:56.94]Pro grenade.
[82:57.26]You have.
[83:20.02]man yeah you gotta you gotta get behind them to shoot the dude we're on this side that was a lot of fun I I I enjoyed that the shooting is really fun it's like
[83:50.95]That's good.
[83:51.41]I like it.
[83:52.29]It's solid.
[83:52.81]Yeah, this is a solid game so far.
[83:54.31]Yeah.
[83:56.59]I just wish unlocking stuff was a little... Yeah, it's weird.
[84:00.83]A little less battle pass-y.
[84:03.79]Yeah, I wish it showed you a lot of guns that you can get to look forward to, you know what I mean?
[84:07.49]I have no idea what the hell's going on.
[84:15.49]We got some money.
[84:16.11]How many outposts did we destroy?
[84:17.33]We destroyed no outposts.
[84:20.24]I'm so glad this doesn't do a Left 4 Dead.
[84:22.26]Look at how many zombies everybody killed because that would have like six.
[84:25.18]It does.
[84:25.76]It does.
[84:26.54]It does.
[84:26.86]It's like stats when you get to your other screen.
[84:28.95]Oh, oh, nobody, please.
[84:30.51]Just please don't.
[84:31.71]Please don't look at it.
[84:32.25]I'm going to look.
[84:32.99]Don't please don't look at it.
[84:34.45]Don't look at it.
[84:35.11]I'm begging you not to look at it.
[84:36.33]We have an interview cutouts of everyone like laughing.
[84:40.46]Like an embarrassed face.
[84:43.70]Like, ooh, damn.
[84:50.92]I get the fog.
[84:51.68]I couldn't shoot through the fog.
[84:53.02]Three kills.
[84:54.36]No way.
[84:54.94]Why do you look like that?
[84:55.90]Oh, that's your your preorder bonus.
[85:00.43]Gotcha.
[85:00.61]You gotta click stats.
[85:05.29]Damn vine sauce with the 89 kills.
[85:08.97]Yo, look at my shots fired.
[85:12.39]I did.
[85:12.91]Oh yeah.
[85:13.19]I know I'm looking at the wrong thing.
[85:20.38]Look.
[85:20.62]Hell yeah.
[85:21.92]I... That level was hard to see.
[85:24.54]And that's what happened.
[85:25.54]Yeah.
[85:26.44]We got it next time, buddy.
[85:29.05]I like the hard to see.
[85:32.61]Where's the friendly... Oh, look, guys.
[85:34.65]Okay, as good as I did, take a look at my friendly fire damage.
[85:39.57]Yeah, I reported you.
[85:40.43]I'm so sorry.
[85:41.51]Yeah, you're gonna get banned.
[85:42.85]Oh my god, that's a lot.
[85:45.03]What the fuck?
[85:45.95]We all have zero.
[85:47.07]You have almost... You have 600...
[85:50.20]There was a turret incident, Jerma?
[85:53.98]It wasn't, it wasn't good.
[85:55.10]Alright, I'm getting a feel for it.
[85:57.02]I'm getting a feel for it.
[85:58.42]Well, didn't you put down the minefields?
[85:59.87]Oh, the mines, too.
[86:00.83]I put down the minefield and Poke, like, wandered into it.
[86:03.31]Yeah, that was bad.
[86:03.95]I also did.
[86:04.59]True.
[86:10.34]I want this flame floor.
[86:10.98]What is this green circle at the top here?
[86:13.00]What is that?
[86:22.94]I'm getting Eagle Cluster Bomb.
[86:31.63]I'm going to save my money.
[86:32.37]Alright, this time I'm going to do much better.
[86:46.21]I guarantee you.
[86:50.40]It's okay.
[86:50.82]It's about the journey, man, anyway.
[86:56.77]If you die in a mission, you drop your samples and you have to pick them up again.
[86:59.53]Yo, guys, read the other group chat.
[87:00.81]What I wrote about Jerma's score.
[87:03.64]The other group chat?
[87:04.28]Yeah, gotcha.
[87:05.86]Oh, wait.
[87:06.68]Can I get an invite to that one?
[87:07.66]I'm not in that one.
[87:09.96]Alright, so where are we going, guys?
[87:11.72]Yo, that's cold.
[87:18.41]Dude, imagine having a four-person group chat and then having a three-person group chat away from the one person.
[87:28.12]That's terrible.
[87:29.64]It's probably happening to one guy each, I feel bad.
[87:31.64]Yeah, it's happening to me right now.
[87:37.44]Yeah, you have to spend points
[87:40.87]In the page one to unlock page two.
[87:44.09]You do.
[87:45.07]I did not realize that.
[87:46.73]Yeah.
[87:47.21]They're just jealous of you.
[87:48.87]Somebody said, this happened to my buddy, Jeremy.
[87:51.45]Oh, yeah.
[87:52.97]There's also, though, there's a separate set of pages.
[87:55.67]There's the... Oh, wait, this is for premiums?
[87:59.35]Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[87:59.89]This could work.
[88:00.53]So if I want that revolver, I just need 15.
[88:02.85]I can buy it.
[88:03.69]Wait, I can buy stuff with real money?
[88:05.03]Should we just do that?
[88:06.19]No.
[88:06.91]No, Polk, don't do it.
[88:07.69]Don't do it.
[88:10.92]I mean, they're trying to force me into the Dwayne role.
[88:13.48]Oh, this is the paid battle pass.
[88:15.30]God damn it.
[88:16.06]Clearly a gym.
[88:16.78]You know what I mean?
[88:17.79]Should I spend my medals?
[88:20.59]At this point, you may as well.
[88:22.05]Yeah, but if I get one more medal, I can get this marksman rifle.
[88:25.93]You can't, though, because the page is locked, right?
[88:29.33]Oh, that's silly.
[88:30.57]Yeah, there's some silly stuff going on here that I'm not crazy about.
[88:34.71]Hmm.
[88:36.75]Hmm.
[88:40.85]Somebody just said, you should make a group chat by yourself and talk about them without them.
[88:50.47]That is a thing that Dwight would do.
[88:53.25]I'm so glad I didn't do it.
[88:55.94]Wait, what about the super credits?
[88:57.38]What do you do with those?
[88:58.26]That's for the super store?
[89:00.42]That's to get like a shitty helmet or something?
[89:02.78]Alright, I'm gonna...
[89:09.61]I got the shotgun.
[89:10.83]Is there a revolver somewhere in this battle pass?
[89:14.93]Jeremy is so funny today.
[89:16.49]This unlock thing is not it.
[89:22.17]It's so bad.
[89:23.93]It's really bad.
[89:25.11]You can buy the battle pass with the free credits, I'm being told.
[89:28.11]What does that mean?
[89:28.99]A worthy choice.
[89:31.98]Like if I wanted the premium war bond, how do you do that?
[89:39.99]No one said that?
[89:43.23]Oh, could you guys not hear this?
[89:45.33]I was doing this.
[89:48.02]Did you hear the typing?
[89:50.52]I'm trying to make a funny joke.
[89:53.40]Go missions at points of interest.
[89:56.18]Buy premium Warbond 1000 at the bottom.
[90:00.20]It can take a while.
[90:02.12]Oh, I'll never do that.
[90:03.00]That'll never happen.
[90:03.96]That's cool.
[90:06.18]I'm ready when you guys are.
[90:07.08]It's all good.
[90:08.16]I'm ready.
[90:10.36]I believe I believe this was like a ore finding mission.
[90:13.20]I think like you can get more war bonds by doing like going to secondary areas on the map.
[90:20.19]Let's maybe we'll try that.
[90:22.77]I'll give each of you 25 subs if you don't open the stats at the end of this mission.
[90:29.33]You got it.
[90:36.00]And that's kind of like an annuity.
[90:37.77]So you'll get them over the course of like 25 years.
[90:41.83]Right.
[90:43.83]It's like a SEP IRA.
[90:44.91]You can't use it until you're 65.
[90:46.09]Yeah, it'll go into your 401k in like 30 years.
[90:51.79]My 401k is just a Pokemon card collection.
[91:00.18]I'm peeing right now.
[91:01.70]Oh, I forgot to pee.
[91:04.35]Wait, should we not have pressed that button?
[91:06.91]There's good odds.
[91:09.13]I don't know how quick of a peer focus.
[91:12.59]I'm going to hold it.
[91:13.13]This would be the worst place to hold a pee.
[91:26.55]I peed before we began, but I'm going to feed myself fluids.
[91:30.66]I've been drinking water.
[91:33.06]Good.
[91:34.76]I'm a water drinker, I'm a water consumer.
[91:36.64]I landed in the middle of a whole bunch of bugs.
[91:41.47]Oh my god.
[91:42.15]Oh my god, Ster, what the fuck is this?
[91:45.17]I need help.
[91:45.65]I need help.
[91:46.85]Holy shit.
[91:47.73]What the fuck is happening?
[91:49.61]I'm back, guys.
[91:50.25]How's everybody doing?
[91:51.57]Not great.
[91:53.80]I'm throwing a minefield.
[91:57.28]If you could reinforce me.
[91:58.38]Leave them behind the minefield.
[91:59.50]Leave them behind the minefield.
[92:01.06]It'll be here in a second.
[92:09.40]Nice.
[92:09.80]Yeah, get him here.
[92:11.58]Get him here.
[92:11.94]I'll distract him.
[92:12.64]I'll distract him.
[92:13.30]He's ragdolled.
[92:22.19]Do they got armor?
[92:24.75]Oh, I could have clustered it.
[92:25.61]Yeah.
[92:29.01]Wait, no.
[92:34.21]Confirm your kills, please.
[92:35.55]The one that you were shooting at.
[92:37.39]Oh, I got the orbital strike.
[92:39.85]Careful for those yellow shitty flowers on the ground.
[92:42.23]Those will explode.
[92:43.21]There's some mines around here.
[92:44.61]Yeah, that's my bad.
[92:47.67]Oh, okay.
[92:51.04]I found one.
[92:52.54]Those were my own mines.
[92:55.74]Did you just throw the reinforcement pod into the minefield?
[92:58.66]Oh, are these mines?
[92:59.80]Oh, I'll shoot it first.
[93:05.49]Oh, I died.
[93:08.60]We're going to close these bug holes.
[93:11.58]You throw grenades?
[93:13.28]Yeah, you throw a grenade at them.
[93:19.50]Boom, got one.
[93:26.51]All right, now we're... We got a...
[93:32.22]What killed you?
[93:33.62]There's mines everywhere, man.
[93:35.06]How many goddamn mines did you throw?
[93:38.60]It was a machine.
[93:42.88]He always does this.
[93:44.22]Sorry, I couldn't mute my coffin.
[93:45.53]He always does this.
[93:48.15]Every game we play, mines.
[93:49.45]I had a sip of water.
[93:50.87]Actually, that's true, though, because last time we played this, remember when I ran into the germa, you were standing on a mine?
[93:56.75]Not this, but Lethal Company.
[93:59.03]And I ran, and you died in the mine.
[94:01.56]Oh, that's right.
[94:06.89]What are you dropping?
[94:18.14]It's a mission thing.
[94:19.98]No, no, no, no mines.
[94:21.08]It's a mission specific stratagem.
[94:39.01]I can't believe he's just calling in more mines.
[94:55.66]Oh, we have to do something with this.
[94:57.68]Log in to the probe interface.
[95:02.38]Log in, dude.
[95:04.32]Uh oh.
[95:05.68]Bug breach detection.
[95:07.30]There's a whole bunch over this hill.
[95:08.54]Buggy's detected.
[95:10.23]Why did I put it away?
[95:13.07]Uh, watch out, I'm gonna shoot a rocket launcher over there.
[95:16.17]We're good.
[95:16.53]I'm out!
[95:17.37]Alright, we're good.
[95:18.15]Get back!
[95:21.73]Just shootin'.
[95:25.95]Get going!
[95:27.15]Get going!
[95:29.08]Liking the shotgun.
[95:31.98]Oh yeah, I equipped the shotgun, I thought.
[95:33.76]I don't have it.
[95:34.46]That's weird.
[95:35.60]Alright, no worries.
[95:36.84]You're doing some pretty good damage over there.
[95:38.14]I threw a grenade by accident.
[95:45.45]Fuck.
[95:45.83]You guys good over there?
[95:46.49]Oh, we should move on.
[95:50.05]What happened with the probe?
[95:51.23]Confirm scan using probe interface.
[95:53.17]We didn't do it yet.
[95:53.83]I gotta do the probe interface.
[95:55.31]Hang on.
[95:58.80]Do you have a sniper, Ster?
[96:01.18]Yeah, I can't figure out how to zoom in with it.
[96:03.32]Try it on my head.
[96:05.78]No.
[96:06.52]Zoom in, press middle mouse stir, I think.
[96:11.03]What, like, hold right click and middle mouse?
[96:12.43]Oh, yeah, I got it, I got it.
[96:13.05]Okay.
[96:13.77]You're so smart.
[96:14.49]Mm, baitable.
[96:24.29]I have a feeling when you do the seismic scan, bugs are going to show up.
[96:30.95]no they did already that's what happened a minute ago yeah yeah I think we already got them all what um uh over here you wanna there's a there's a point of interest over there that um I set a waypoint should we go there now or yeah we've got 35 minutes I think we can probably probably even check out this this uh outpost here
[97:00.94]Ooh.
[97:02.62]Are they little credits or something?
[97:05.30]Ooh, nice.
[97:05.86]Kind of strange.
[97:08.10]The samples are some upgrade thing.
[97:11.74]And those are, I think those are the premium credits.
[97:13.84]Super credits.
[97:15.28]Interesting.
[97:15.56]I'm not sure you took all of them.
[97:17.42]No, I think we all share them.
[97:19.10]Oh, okay.
[97:23.83]My neck just snapped in half.
[97:28.19]I just shit myself.
[97:32.63]There's an objective where I am, guys.
[97:34.11]I don't know if you want to check it out.
[97:35.81]It's on the map.
[97:38.95]I'm going.
[97:39.43]If anyone wants a rocket launcher, it is dropping in one second.
[97:47.07]We got fliers!
[97:48.91]And by fliers, I mean jumpers.
[97:54.74]Ster, you're alone over there.
[97:56.04]We're spread out.
[97:57.16]We should group.
[97:59.29]Come to me.
[97:59.77]There's a whole set of things that need to be done here.
[98:02.29]Grab this rocket launcher while you're at it.
[98:04.43]I can't carry it.
[98:05.22]I have the sniper.
[98:08.96]Group.
[98:10.12]I'm out.
[98:12.94]Using tax dollars well.
[98:14.40]Acquire soil scan.
[98:21.90]Stir, you just soiled yourself, right?
[98:24.98]Not today, actually.
[98:27.30]Oh.
[98:28.45]That's...
[98:30.41]I'm getting better.
[98:34.12]There's nothing here.
[98:36.34]Yeah.
[98:38.64]I think you're looking at the objective we already cleared, which was when I landed it in all the bugs.
[98:43.18]Oh, no, this whole place.
[98:44.68]This is a different it says verify or vein.
[98:47.39]Oh, wait, you know what?
[98:48.55]That's the other place.
[98:49.39]I think we just go north east.
[98:53.29]This is fashion, apparently.
[98:54.35]Oh, dude, these stink clouds, though, in this area are looking like my diaper.
[99:00.10]That's cool.
[99:01.12]I feel like there's maybe five or six times ever that you can make a joke like that, and I think you've done it 40 times.
[99:08.16]That's also me though, Jerm.
[99:09.60]I have a terrible bit called the diaper chief.
[99:13.38]So yeah, it's pretty bad.
[99:15.52]You two should sync up.
[99:18.52]Stir, you want to play a diaper game?
[99:20.94]I would love to play a diaper game with you.
[99:22.83]Let's find one.
[99:24.93]We live in a time where you can say, let's find a diaper game, and there probably is like 10.
[99:31.77]I would love that for us.
[99:48.79]I have no mana.
[99:52.23]Wait, ammo or?
[99:54.25]Yeah.
[99:56.05]Dude, you know what?
[99:58.39]I feel you.
[100:00.71]It's everything.
[100:04.45]It's all the same thing.
[100:05.71]I'm going in.
[100:11.36]I'm going to do a resupply.
[100:13.26]Wait, somebody already do it.
[100:15.14]Yeah, right here.
[100:15.62]Yeah.
[100:18.26]Thank you.
[100:18.54]Oh, we got bug holes.
[100:23.08]Anybody want rocket launcher?
[100:24.06]I've got two coming in.
[100:31.24]Rocket launcher, anybody?
[100:32.04]Uh, too late.
[100:33.86]I have my machine gun.
[100:36.34]I'm OK.
[100:38.88]I mean, I'm kind of hungry.
[100:42.07]You could call in like some burgers.
[100:45.77]Where's the next?
[100:46.93]Are we going to the Orange Mountains?
[100:51.29]OK.
[100:53.97]Yeah, oh no.
[100:57.25]Help.
[100:58.30]I don't like the sound of that.
[100:59.18]What's going on?
[100:59.62]You're so far behind.
[101:01.08]Oh, my God.
[101:01.62]You're all the way back there.
[101:02.70]I'm good.
[101:02.94]I'm good.
[101:03.14]I'm good.
[101:03.32]I'm good.
[101:03.52]I'm good.
[101:03.70]I'm okay.
[101:03.90]I'm okay.
[101:04.10]There are a lot of people like me.
[101:07.71]Hey, do you guys like egg salads?
[101:09.35]Oh, my God.
[101:10.01]It's my favorite food ever.
[101:10.85]I'm not even kidding.
[101:12.49]Really?
[101:12.77]Yeah.
[101:15.93]Do you like egg salad, Poach?
[101:17.75]Yeah, I like making it.
[101:19.42]Do you like making it more than eating it, or do you like both?
[101:23.60]They're both fun.
[101:24.74]Bro, we have to exchange recipes, dude.
[101:26.52]I'm not even kidding.
[101:27.98]We should have an egg salad cook-off.
[101:32.43]What's different?
[101:34.77]I got a recipe.
[101:36.01]Poke, do you put certain stuff in it?
[101:38.51]Don't tell me your recipe because I don't want anyone else to get it.
[101:42.45]I forget to put the dill part.
[101:45.61]I don't do dill at all.
[101:47.46]Yeah, apparently you gotta add dill.
[101:49.60]Jerma, let's use the other group to share recipes.
[101:54.83]Yeah, the dill group?
[101:56.17]Yeah, so that way folk doesn't get the recipe.
[101:58.37]Yeah.
[102:00.43]Could you guys please invite me and Jerma to the Dil group?
[102:03.95]I mean, we've been asking.
[102:04.95]We've got to figure this out, man, because I think I look over here and there's like 16 different groups with some of you.
[102:09.35]We'll invite you to the Egg Salad group if you guys bring us to the... Yeah, we've just got to condense this to one group, guys.
[102:14.62]We have the Egg Salad group, we have the fucking dance group, we have the weightlifting group, and it's the four of us.
[102:20.56]We don't need to have 15 different DM groups.
[102:24.38]I've never even fenced.
[102:25.08]Why do you need to be in the weightlifting group?
[102:28.81]Well, because I fence with Vinny, so I figured I could be in the weightlifting group with you, but I don't know.
[102:34.35]Wait, you fence with Vinny?
[102:35.23]I thought we fenced together in our own group.
[102:37.07]Do you guys fence?
[102:38.51]I fence with Poke.
[102:40.10]Oh.
[102:41.54]Yeah, we fenced on the side, but we didn't tell you guys.
[102:43.52]There could be some consolidation here.
[102:46.63]probably like get down to like 10 groups instead of 15 at least like 12 I think there's one of them we haven't talked in in like eight years and the last thing it was just like somebody just wrote lol it's like we can just leave that like we can probably get rid of that one do you leave your discord groups or just leave it there
[103:05.19]you gotta leave it there because if you're the guy who leaves everyone's annoyed that you oh I got the notification and all I got is this guy left yep and it's like oh okay you left the group oh but go go ahead take off see you later even if it's like a 10 year old group there was some group we were in from like several years ago or like two years ago whatever it was and someone left it recently and it like scared me yeah I know what you're talking about like a phone call
[103:30.76]I think it was someone from that really big lethal company group.
[103:33.67]Yeah, I think so.
[103:34.19]Someone left like a week ago.
[103:35.07]You're like, what?
[103:35.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:36.69]Something like that.
[103:37.51]It's so funny because that's like scared.
[103:39.31]Like that is what you should do.
[103:42.55]And that person that left is like, you know what, bros?
[103:45.03]I don't want to get your fucking notifications.
[103:47.11]No, I don't want notifications either.
[103:51.02]But you don't have to leave to get notifications.
[103:53.24]Yeah, no one's in there.
[103:54.00]No one's typing in there.
[103:54.86]You can just mute it.
[103:55.50]Yeah.
[103:56.06]Yeah.
[103:57.23]or like that group has been dead for like since we did it dude I've had all discord notifications muted since like 2014. like I yeah same I don't even know he never responds since the beginning no what you do is every six months you look at the left-hand panel and look at like the 400 red um indicators and you just go well I guess I'm not answering any of these
[104:25.94]I have notifications off on everything except one thing, and that's my emergency thing.
[104:32.96]Everything else, like, I did this years ago as a way to, like, take back control of my life.
[104:37.69]Because I was just, like, notifications were just, like, running my life.
[104:41.03]So I said, you know what?
[104:42.67]I need to stop that.
[104:43.75]And it's been much better.
[104:45.11]Which notifications ruined your life the most?
[104:48.75]Probably grinder.
[104:54.09]Alright, alright, that's OK.
[104:57.21]Alright, wait, we're going to drill.
[104:58.68]I'm going to do the drill hole and it's up up down down.
[105:03.00]My chat like that one.
[105:04.18]Oh God, don't flip it.
[105:05.26]Don't flip it.
[105:06.38]Alright, I'll get the terminal.
[105:16.46]I'll bring you.
[105:17.90]Alright, I didn't do it.
[105:18.86]Hold on.
[105:23.24]Got this.
[105:24.54]Got it.
[105:25.12]Hell yeah.
[105:35.50]I thought it said Vainy or Vain.
[105:37.54]It said Verify or Vain.
[105:40.13]Kurt or Vain, my favorite rock star.
[105:46.98]Yeah, notifications, man.
[105:48.08]Social media, I don't... I have almost completely fucked off from all social media.
[105:53.66]It's too much.
[105:54.42]I don't even want to look at it.
[105:55.46]I hate it.
[105:58.22]I set my, you know, my times.
[106:03.49]But also, you have maybe a different experience because, you know, your combo meal.
[106:11.95]But I too have also found a way to just kind of like... It's just too much to keep up with, man.
[106:16.70]It's just like... Watch out, combo meal.
[106:20.22]What do you guys do when you're pooping, though?
[106:23.08]I read articles.
[106:26.00]I don't even read articles, actually.
[106:27.14]That's a lie.
[106:27.64]I like how I'm trying to read an article and then a full-page spread comes up.
[106:30.96]It's like, please support us.
[106:31.95]We're dying.
[106:32.49]And I'm like, I can't even read the article.
[106:34.53]Support what?
[106:38.67]Like us.
[106:39.15]What do I have to do?
[106:40.77]Like the New York Journal.
[106:42.13]That was really easy for me.
[106:43.77]Yeah, I know, but if you can't read the article, support what?
[106:46.09]I didn't even get to read anything.
[106:47.89]Yeah, I don't know.
[106:48.59]That's why I don't do it.
[106:49.73]My favorite is I was using the Microsoft default calculator, and while I was using it, it was like, please rate our app.
[106:57.86]Yeah.
[106:58.28]What?
[106:59.32]You're a calculator.
[107:02.08]Please rate our calculator.
[107:04.68]And you know what's funny?
[107:05.36]The calculator on your phone doesn't even have solar power.
[107:07.61]Like, we had that technology like 30 years ago.
[107:10.23]Also doesn't have solar power.
[107:14.33]Yeah, dude.
[107:15.07]You can't even do the thing where you cover up the solar panel and it disappears and you can make numbers appear out of nowhere.
[107:22.42]Oh, shit.
[107:25.04]True.
[107:27.40]One more sample.
[107:30.54]I got this.
[107:31.02]I got this.
[107:40.46]And we said, haha, I used to do that.
[107:42.34]Haha.
[107:43.88]I can't tell if that's sarcastic or if... You guys ever do the weird S?
[107:48.40]I, the weird S was my shit.
[107:54.51]I drew Mega Man levels in my, like, notebook.
[107:57.77]And I'd use the lines of the notebook to help, like, make the levels, like, even.
[108:03.35]Aww, that's... that's adorable.
[108:12.58]I used to.
[108:13.08]I still do, but I used to as well.
[108:18.51]I know I have a lot of my old notebooks from high school and college, so I want to scan some of the worst drawings I ever did.
[108:28.39]I want to see what that shit's all about.
[108:29.83]That's a cool idea.
[108:30.81]That's really cool.
[108:31.83]That's not a bad idea, yeah.
[108:39.41]Upload sample data.
[108:39.99]Oh, we still got another... Oops, that was a mistake.
[108:43.00]I just broke my character's neck.
[108:46.72]This one takes a while, so we have to do a lot of various things here.
[108:52.32]We only got 22 minutes left.
[108:53.40]Are we done?
[108:56.22]I think we just did it.
[109:00.26]You can zoom out on the tab map.
[109:02.12]There are so many things.
[109:04.70]Oh, you can.
[109:06.50]It says here there's a medium nest.
[109:07.98]You want to go to you guys want to take care of that?
[109:09.90]Yeah, we might as well, but we need money.
[109:13.69]Yeah.
[109:14.91]Yeah, it's up in orbital.
[109:16.99]I need a resupply.
[109:34.62]Ooh.
[109:36.18]Supply.
[109:39.36]Put the resupply on its skin.
[109:44.68]This is an armored enemy.
[109:47.82]You guys, we need a minefield.
[109:50.64]Oh yeah?
[109:51.52]I got a minefield for you.
[109:53.02]Back up!
[109:54.32]We're all dead.
[109:55.04]I'm gonna throw a grenade from here into there.
[110:05.03]You ready?
[110:05.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[110:07.03]Look at this.
[110:08.85]Oh, that was like firework.
[110:10.41]That was poor.
[110:15.25]I'm out of grenades.
[110:16.79]I got one, but we need several more.
[110:18.43]I'm on it.
[110:22.03]Cover me.
[110:23.43]All right.
[110:25.27]Yeah.
[110:25.75]Oh.
[110:27.93]It's crazy.
[110:28.85]It only takes me one grenade per hole.
[110:32.51]Well, I threw one in there, too.
[110:33.79]C2.
[110:33.93]C2.
[110:34.11]Okay, good.
[110:34.77]You're all right.
[110:39.41]Ooh.
[110:40.52]Careful.
[110:40.90]The turret is non-discriminatory.
[110:43.34]It will kill us, too.
[110:44.26]Uh-oh.
[110:49.70]Oh, it just did.
[110:51.68]Oh, no.
[110:52.26]I maybe stayed prone.
[110:54.07]Uh-oh.
[110:55.69]Was that the turret?
[110:56.79]Because I just got one shot.
[110:58.77]Yeah.
[110:59.63]I'm raised.
[111:00.03]I'm raised.
[111:01.50]You rizzed?
[111:02.54]I rizzed.
[111:03.00]This is how I lie down and watch TV.
[111:08.89]Oh yeah.
[111:15.41]You look like my dad.
[111:18.35]What does that make you feel?
[111:19.37]Oh, out of ammo.
[111:29.66]There's a lot of bugs, but I'm more scared of the sentry.
[111:33.94]Probably nothing, yeah.
[111:36.00]The shotgun I got, I got whoever had the stir.
[111:40.59]Good.
[111:41.17]Shotgun's real good.
[111:41.89]Yeah, shotgun's great.
[111:42.69]It has a lot of range.
[111:44.25]That's what I like.
[111:44.89]In a video game, I like a shotgun with range, like in Doom or Quake 1.
[111:48.63]I like those shotguns a lot.
[111:51.13]Well, you know what's called a slug shot?
[111:53.72]Yeah.
[111:56.58]It's funny because it sounded like a slug voice.
[111:59.52]Slug would sound like that.
[112:03.12]I'm a business owner.
[112:04.30]I'm a business owner.
[112:08.55]When you do the Roblox stuff, it's one of my favorite things ever.
[112:11.99]Oh, yeah.
[112:12.31]It gets weird.
[112:16.69]It's really fun when you realize you're just around kids in school and you're like, yeah, I should not be here.
[112:22.06]Yeah.
[112:25.05]I did Among Us VR once in a random lobby, and yeah, it was like preschool.
[112:29.13]It was very strange.
[112:31.23]It was like, never again.
[112:33.59]We played it that one time, and I was like, oh, that was so for that birthday party.
[112:37.93]And I was like, oh, that was kind of cool.
[112:39.89]But then I was like, I don't think I'm going to play this again.
[112:43.02]Among Us VR?
[112:44.16]No, no, Roblox.
[112:46.00]Oh, Roblox.
[112:53.89]Poke, I heard you like to ride around on a bicycle in GTA.
[112:57.65]Yeah.
[112:58.69]It's fun.
[112:59.51]That's sick.
[113:00.95]It's fun.
[113:05.35]We should do VR chat, though.
[113:07.91]Soon.
[113:08.55]I want to do VR chat.
[113:10.05]I want to play VR games.
[113:12.65]Or different games.
[113:13.41]Like multiplayer ones.
[113:15.11]There's probably some cool VR or Arizona Sunshine 2.
[113:18.29]Is that good?
[113:19.43]Like a VR co-op zombie game.
[113:22.53]Could be fun.
[113:23.50]My chat would probably know better than me, but most of what I've done in VR is just VR chat exploration and stuff.
[113:30.76]Yeah, I like that.
[113:31.46]I love that.
[113:32.44]I like just seeing cool maps.
[113:34.76]VR mini golf.
[113:35.68]There's a really good VR mini golf that I've played a bunch.
[113:41.70]Got no reaction out of that one.
[113:42.60]There's a good mini golf game too, though.
[113:46.72]For VR.
[113:47.20]It's like walkabout VR.
[113:49.62]Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.
[113:50.71]Yeah, yeah.
[113:50.99]Oh, I thought you meant VR chat map.
[113:52.94]Yeah.
[113:53.20]Oh, no, no, no.
[113:54.79]VR diaper games, you know.
[113:58.29]I'll look into it.
[114:01.83]I'm.
[114:08.26]I may need reinforcement.
[114:11.04]I got you.
[114:11.66]Oh, you got a floating gun.
[114:22.65]How much time do you think?
[114:26.98]My eagle cluster bomb.
[114:27.98]Watch out.
[114:29.62]Check this out.
[114:31.08]Where's my... Where are my old things?
[114:34.78]Whoa!
[114:35.02]That was cool.
[114:35.68]Holy shit.
[114:36.50]That was crazy.
[114:37.38]Get some!
[114:39.22]Shut up!
[114:42.14]Eat it!
[114:45.52]You see how there's these dust clouds coming from the ground in the distance?
[114:49.64]I need you guys to understand that that's where the bugs come from and we need to blow them up.
[114:54.31]Oh, okay.
[114:55.03]So what you're saying is create a minefield?
[114:57.79]No.
[114:58.63]I just see a lot of conversation going around while everyone stands next to them.
[115:01.99]You're talking about the orange smoke over here?
[115:04.27]Yeah.
[115:05.27]Oh, they got this one.
[115:10.22]Actually, I think we could use a minefield right about now.
[115:12.20]Oh my god.
[115:19.38]Nice.
[115:26.00]Oh fuck.
[115:29.23]I think this game is heating my room up by like 5 degrees.
[115:47.19]Did your door close?
[115:48.41]Whoa!
[115:49.15]How did I not get killed by that?
[115:51.11]Careful though, careful, careful.
[115:57.22]Yeah, just as much as possible stay in front of it.
[115:59.28]Oh my god.
[116:01.60]Damn.
[116:03.34]That's a big bomb.
[116:04.24]It's shuttle time.
[116:13.72]What is that?
[116:16.44]He's calling down resupplies at the last minute.
[116:23.68]Did you just shoot a rocket at our shuttle?
[116:26.93]Yeah.
[116:29.43]Psychopath.
[116:30.43]I was just seeing what happened.
[116:34.37]Farming clips he tried.
[116:36.27]True.
[116:43.14]my favorite clips are the ones where like everyone in the group gets along and has a great time and then like compliments each other good team I think that's it yeah yeah excellent match everybody that was our best one yet maybe oh man this is gonna be top of live stream fails which one what is this where we're all happy about how well that round went that's a success that's a win that's a live stream win no one knows the difference
[117:10.81]Alright, nobody look at your stats because I need to look at mine first on my stream.
[117:23.31]I think I got at least 40 or 50 kills.
[117:29.75]It was the failure of the enemies.
[117:34.12]I do have to pee.
[117:34.72]I'm just going to run over there and pee.
[117:36.54]I'm going to run and pee.
[117:38.78]Run over there.
[117:41.34]I know where he's going.
[117:42.38]It's just a corner right here that I'd be in.
[117:48.63]Where'd you get those cool?
[117:51.47]OK, alright.
[117:53.87]I'm OK with that.
[117:57.01]Vinny, you are playing this game.
[117:59.17]I don't know how, but I am gaming.
[118:01.03]This is usually the abnormal for me.
[118:04.05]Freedom wins again.
[118:05.49]You're gaming.
[118:07.83]Goodness gracious, we are gaming.
[118:10.40]That's some gaming.
[118:13.01]Well, I think it counts teammates in the kills.
[118:17.55]All right.
[118:19.09]All right.
[118:19.73]I only got 11 damage that time.
[118:20.99]I'll be right back.
[118:22.65]Well, you get a lot of medals, though.
[118:23.99]I got 17, though.
[118:26.11]Wait a second.
[118:28.21]I'm just going to mute.
[118:28.73]I'll be right back.
[118:32.81]Oh, yeah.
[118:33.09]We got a ton of medals.
[118:34.41]Okay.
[118:34.59]It's because we did so well.
[118:36.33]We did all the bonus objectives and shit.
[118:43.01]Still don't like the system.
[118:45.37]Yeah.
[118:45.81]I think it's pretty terrible, but, you know.
[118:50.95]There's not enough pages, though.
[118:53.29]No.
[118:55.14]Premium battle face!
[119:00.40]I thought I had 100.
[119:01.24]Why does it say I have 10?
[119:06.74]I feel like the sniper is not good.
[119:08.06]In this kind of game.
[119:12.16]uh it would be good against the robots oh sure I think you can shoot like the knee joints on the the at-ats and they kind of flobble over wobble yeah they do a little bit of flabbling you honestly gonna just start questioning me like I can't get a little past I like I like it my question I enjoy it marksman rifle the diligence is that where you guys have the diligence rifle
[119:41.83]uh yeah anti-material rifle oh that's the I gotcha oh yeah I'll try a hundred that's a hundred that's a hundred so I mean you could eventually get the premium battle pass but I know me and I'm not ever gonna play this game enough to get that
[120:10.18]if you're uh if you're looking at the armors too you tab because all the armors have like a special passive oh they do wow okay even helmets too oh wait no not helmets the ones we have don't have
[120:40.71]Vinny, please, new helmet.
[120:41.93]You talking about this helmet, chat?
[120:45.89]You like it?
[120:48.94]You're letting your kid watch a stream like Jerma's?
[120:52.72]This is a mature audience stream.
[120:53.84]You're here to click the button.
[121:00.62]Mature audience stream.
[121:01.42]Get the fuck out of here.
[121:06.45]I'm gonna get this rifle.
[121:11.79]You and your kid get the fuck out of here.
[121:13.75]Yeah, you and your kid fucking leave.
[121:17.41]I'm just... I'm kidding.
[121:25.46]Reduces recoil when crouching or prone.
[121:27.88]They said it was like three months old.
[121:31.88]They don't... Well, that kid right now... Can you hear me?
[121:44.17]I want that kid to listen to me right now.
[121:45.85]That's so funny.
[121:49.30]It's an infant.
[121:53.64]Teach the boy.
[121:54.40]Teach the child correctly from the beginning.
[121:58.08]Remember, my idiot newborn is in the room.
[122:05.91]What a sentence.
[122:13.14]Alright, I'm gonna spend some money after this.
[122:16.56]I just got a big thick outfit and I got like a marksman rifle.
[122:21.34]I'm pretty happy about that.
[122:22.16]You're so big!
[122:23.32]Yeah, let me slim down.
[122:28.26]I'm using the same armor.
[122:29.68]I'm in the pod right now and I'm running out of oxygen!
[122:32.54]Isn't there a way to slim down, chat?
[122:40.15]character, body type, lean.
[122:41.91]What the heck?
[122:42.57]This is tiny.
[122:44.42]Yeah, take Ozempic.
[122:49.62]I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
[122:51.36]Have you guys heard about that meta?
[122:53.46]What is that meta?
[122:55.18]This thing called Ozempic.
[122:57.12]That sounds like a depression medicine.
[122:59.56]Is it?
[122:59.70]It's a diabetes medicine.
[123:01.42]Wait, wait a minute.
[123:03.22]Is that the one that goes, oh, oh, oh, Ozempic.
[123:08.56]You know.
[123:09.59]They do that, don't they?
[123:10.55]I don't think that's them.
[123:12.97]No, they do.
[123:13.75]Yes, they do.
[123:15.71]Wait, really?
[123:16.35]I swear I've heard that.
[123:18.48]You just said that word and I was like, wait, why have I heard that?
[123:21.04]And then it's like that song.
[123:22.06]He's right.
[123:22.86]Okay.
[123:24.66]Chad is saying that's correct.
[123:25.90]Yeah, I don't know.
[123:27.38]That's crazy.
[123:28.62]Imagine being the band that licensed that out and made millions of dollars and bought an island for them.
[123:35.13]I was laughing the other day about this.
[123:36.29]There's a brand.
[123:37.73]I forget what the brand is, but their jingle is la la la la la.
[123:44.80]That's the jingle.
[123:47.16]What is that brand?
[123:47.96]It's like an air freshener or something.
[123:53.02]Was it in that cadence?
[123:54.44]Yeah, it's Febreze.
[123:55.78]And it's like, oh, Febreze.
[123:57.50]La, la, la, la, la.
[123:58.62]I swear to God.
[124:01.54]The person who wrote that jingle probably got like a 500k check for that.
[124:05.58]I mean, it's kind of smart.
[124:14.73]I could write a jingle about bloody bagels.
[124:17.07]I should do that.
[124:23.02]Are you good?
[124:24.34]What?
[124:24.54]Yeah, I'm good.
[124:25.04]You're being very weird.
[124:26.32]Why am I being weird?
[124:27.27]I don't know.
[124:29.43]Yeah, why is your fist out like that?
[124:30.79]You're making me very uncomfortable.
[124:33.31]Salute.
[124:33.97]You're freaking me out.
[124:35.19]Yeah, now you think it should be like... Spritz, spritz, Febreze.
[124:38.35]Spritz, spritz, Febreze.
[124:42.56]Make your home smell nice.
[124:44.22]Make your home smell well.
[124:46.95]Holy shit, I threw that so far.
[124:49.09]Holy shit.
[124:51.85]Yeah, rifle's awesome.
[124:54.51]I thought it was like a bolt.
[124:59.67]This is like my favorite type of rifle in a video game.
[125:02.35]That and bolt actions.
[125:06.35]It fucking does.
[125:07.79]It really does that.
[125:12.35]Okay, I gotta play the game.
[125:13.11]I gotta stop looking at chat.
[125:14.67]Is this just a defense mission?
[125:17.83]uh we just gotta yeah I think we just gotta kill x amount of bugs reload no bugs yeah 125. this is paired with the other mission so I think we get a lot if we beat them both where is my gun that's what I was told I don't know where is your gun I did did you drop a shotgun that had no ammo on the ground and I picked it up and now my other gun is gone big breach detector for some mines yeah I think you got there's ammo over here you probably have to pick up
[125:48.62]I think it was a secondary.
[125:49.96]Yeah, it's like a weird.
[125:52.24]I don't know why I have it.
[125:55.30]Oh, that one didn't roll and bounce all over.
[125:58.52]Did that work?
[126:04.01]Hey, run away from that.
[126:06.77]Wait, what the fuck?
[126:07.71]Oh, oh.
[126:12.18]God damn it, dude.
[126:13.28]I got hit.
[126:15.37]Careful, Jerma.
[126:15.99]Get out of there.
[126:16.71]Don't put it next to me.
[126:18.51]I don't know.
[126:18.85]It was an accident.
[126:19.89]That was huge.
[126:24.13]It was in the middle of our base.
[126:27.76]It was like the direct middle area.
[126:36.38]Has Jerma ever heard the Cars for Kids song?
[126:38.58]Have you heard that one, Jerma?
[126:40.94]Yeah.
[126:42.22]1-877-CARS-FOR-KIDS.
[126:43.50]Oh, my God!

[126:52.13]I'll get you back.
[126:52.67]Wait, what do you mean, Cars for Kids?
[126:54.87]What was it?
[126:56.15]It's, like, for kids that want to drive cars.
[126:58.69]Like, like, like, like toddlers.
[127:00.61]1-877-CARS-FOR-KIDS.

[127:55.14]The machine gun sentry went away for some reason.
[127:58.50]It's weird.
[128:03.17]Calling down a support weapon!
[128:09.38]You know things are going real well when I look over at my chat and I see a pogchamp.

[128:17.55]It's been two hours.
[128:22.71]I mean, I haven't really been using it.
[128:24.67]There's not much of a need.
[128:27.04]I like it.
[128:29.82]Yeah, for the marksman rifle, it's really good.

[131:13.75]That was my favorite entry in the series.
[131:17.89]Gears of War, come on.
[131:20.74]It's the Japanese release.
[131:22.14]It's like Gears of War, come on, let's go.
[131:26.38]I want to come join you guys.
[131:27.50]Wasn't there Gears of War a couple years ago and it just didn't make a blip?
[131:35.66]um I remember a lot of people playing it I'm gonna say it right now controversial take years of war got carried by that trailer wait you mean the one that it was like you're familiar oh and then they go in that song they bury down like they go like a million miles per hour into the earth yeah yeah that was a good one I'm gonna I'm gonna give a hot take here
[132:04.25]That Gears of War got carried by CliffyB.
[132:06.01]Every game he's ever made is the best game ever created, especially LawBreakers.
[132:10.61]Did you go to the LawBreakers sponsor?
[132:14.09]Hey, I got a hot take for you.
[132:19.15]I have not played one single second of any Gears of War game, not even one minute.
[132:27.06]They're good.
[132:27.56]I mean, Gears 2 was like, when that came out, that was awesome.
[132:30.94]Like, I played a ton of that with my friends.
[132:32.40]We always enjoyed it.
[132:35.11]I wasn't an Xbox guy.
[132:36.97]Yeah, it was an Xbox thing.
[132:38.40]I had a 360, but I don't know.
[132:42.48]That game was always a game that I always knew people played, but I just was one of the people not playing it.
[132:48.07]And I don't even know why.
[132:49.63]Solid game.
[132:50.61]What did you play on your 360?
[132:53.43]um like gta4 viking game viking game viking like let's go to asgard or whatever it is it's like a 360 game it's pretty awesome by the way
[133:08.48]Let's go to Asgard.
[133:09.74]I don't know what that means.
[133:10.73]That's all you played?
[133:11.45]I don't know.
[133:12.71]Too Human?
[133:13.37]Viva Piñata.
[133:14.15]Too Human was a wonderful, wonderful disaster.
[133:19.45]Oh.
[133:19.73]We unlocked Challenger.
[133:25.89]Are we ready for the challenge?
[133:28.13]Real helldiver activation in 100 years.
[133:31.01]Of course there was a challenging.
[133:34.71]This is the fear games were so good.
[133:38.91]Always.
[133:39.35]I love the fear games here.
[133:41.05]One is one of the funniest games ever made.
[133:42.79]By the way, like if you want, he is.
[133:44.37]Oh, it's so funny.
[133:46.07]Well, you laughed back in the day.
[133:47.31]Oh, I laughed like a year ago.
[133:51.13]Oh, OK, year ago.
[133:51.81]Yeah, probably.
[133:52.41]But dude, that that.
[133:54.30]That game was terrifying as a kid.
[133:56.26]It's a great game.
[133:57.12]Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful.
[133:58.22]Under the stairs, when you go down the stairs and you see the girl right before you go down?
[134:02.42]That was crazy.
[134:04.34]Fear 2, Fear 3 was where it kind of fell apart, right?
[134:07.95]Wasn't Fear... No, Fear 3 was like the weird pregnancy shit, right?
[134:12.63]I never played Fear 3.
[134:15.07]Do you remember that?
[134:16.03]That was very weird.
[134:21.91]Oh, it was two?
[134:22.47]Yeah, I was kind of scared of Fear 3 until, like, the Mpreg came up, then it just got goofy.
[134:27.72]Yeah, I remember that.
[134:28.30]I'm sorry, what are you people talking about right now?
[134:30.62]Fear.
[134:31.32]Uh, I don't, I never played Fear.
[134:32.82]What do you mean Mpreg?
[134:34.34]There's... You remember, like, the enemy, like, the little girl?
[134:40.19]Okay, then we should probably stop talking.
[134:42.51]Oh my god, I can, I can get a gas strike.
[134:45.67]How much is it?
[134:46.05]It's really weird.
[134:48.39]I don't remember correctly, but it's very weird.
[134:51.58]yeah it sounds it sounds pretty weird this does not look that good but it's on brand so I'll get it what are these ship modules chat exploding shrapnel oh that's what oh god you need 100 green to get some oh my god oh okay oh I was not seated when you did that I'm probably splattered against the back window
[135:23.26]Blood mist.
[135:24.38]Good.
[135:25.26]Just call on another.
[135:32.58]You look cool, Ster.
[135:33.72]Let me see.
[135:36.48]Equal cluster bomb.
[135:39.77]That does not feel good to see.
[135:41.19]Spend 237 more to get this.
[135:42.17]Spend 700... 1,000 more medals.
[135:50.02]I do not look forward.
[135:51.08]I got 28 medals.
[135:52.70]Am I just sitting on, like, a gold mine?
[135:55.10]Like, should I spend it?
[135:56.78]Yeah, you know, you have to spend to unlock further tiers anyway, so I bought, like, the shotgun and some stuff, and then I got, like, a cool rifle.
[136:04.93]Gotta spend money to make money.
[136:06.75]What's this thing?
[136:10.87]You guys ever play Tarkov?
[136:13.17]I played, like, twice.
[136:15.59]I have not.
[136:17.97]I played a lot more Dark and Darker when that came out.
[136:22.81]Surprised you haven't tried it, Stirr.
[136:24.01]I don't... I usually don't like a lot of the super realism shooters with like no HUD and... Because like if I play it, Jerma's just gonna shoot me and think it's funny and then I gotta sit there for 30 minutes.
[136:38.98]I like how Jerma's in your hypothetical.
[136:42.09]Yeah, dude.
[136:42.79]Okay.
[136:44.33]I can... I can get him to show up anytime, anywhere.
[136:48.52]It's my superpower.
[136:49.68]I snap my fingers and he says, oh, yes, yes, I'm so sorry, because I have dirt on him.
[136:53.51]Oh.
[137:00.71]All right, where are we dropping?
[137:02.13]This is a lot.
[137:04.09]It's a lot of things.
[137:04.93]I bought that gun that was four medals.
[137:08.27]I don't know if it's any good, but I'll try it.
[137:11.34]It's good.
[137:13.54]We're doing a challenging.
[137:14.64]Uh-oh.
[137:16.88]Ooh, I got my gas.
[137:19.08]This might be tough, guys.
[137:21.74]Keep your wits about you.
[137:23.20]This is challenging?
[137:26.59]Did you ever see the thing of me in the VR mod?
[137:30.65]I did.
[137:30.95]Where I was locked in the room with the gas.
[137:32.71]Did you ever see that?
[137:34.79]You go to the sink, gas.
[137:36.37]You go to the vent, gas.
[137:38.03]You go to the drawer, gas.
[137:40.25]I love that.
[137:42.25]That was one of my most memorable VR moments ever.
[137:46.27]And it's your fault.
[137:50.37]Have you seen Saw X?
[137:52.67]I haven't seen Saw 10.
[137:53.86]I've never seen any Saw.
[137:55.50]Oh, then never mind.
[137:57.56]Do I need to watch a Saw movie?
[137:59.34]You don't watch the first 9 to get 10.
[138:02.24]No, you need to watch 1, 2, 3, 4, skip 5, 6, 7, 8, and then watch 10, and then pretend Spiral did not come out.
[138:11.69]Saw Spiral is the name of it?
[138:13.47]Just pretend.
[138:14.89]You're already way ahead of the game.
[138:16.41]You're good.
[138:16.77]There's an invisible bug behind us.
[138:27.44]There's a couple invisible bugs on the prowl.
[138:29.26]Oh, there's a big... Yo, guys, big monster!
[138:30.48]Big monster!
[138:31.18]Whoa.
[138:32.08]Ah, Jesus.
[138:33.91]Oh, yeah, they go invisible.
[138:35.91]That's probably part of the challenging difficulty.
[138:38.51]That's a lot of monsters already.
[138:40.23]We just got here.
[138:41.11]Holy shit.
[138:43.01]I think we dropped in a pretty risky zone.
[138:46.46]Oh.
[138:46.56]Watch out.
[138:46.86]I got a grenade launcher dropping right there.
[138:50.30]Grab it and fire.
[138:53.93]Run away now, guys.
[138:54.65]Run away now.
[138:55.53]Run away now.
[138:56.61]We're surrounded, bro.
[138:59.98]Nice.
[139:00.60]Nice.
[139:00.88]Oh, objective complete.
[139:01.78]Good job.
[139:02.78]How did we do that?
[139:03.72]I res.
[139:04.02]Don't worry.
[139:04.68]I got you a res.
[139:05.32]It was so worth it.
[139:08.12]Oh, I'm eliminated.
[139:09.46]Shit.
[139:11.18]All right.
[139:11.72]I need to drop on something, too.
[139:13.30]Okay.
[139:17.98]Oh, my God.
[139:18.82]I'm dead.
[139:31.27]Hey, the ice is so cool.
[139:32.89]I gotta get my gun.
[139:33.65]It's so cold.
[139:40.17]Orbital strike going down.
[139:42.25]No, never mind.
[139:48.03]What the fuck?
[139:49.11]I'm stuck.
[139:49.73]I can't do anything.
[139:51.85]Wait, really?
[139:52.24]What the hell?
[139:54.12]I'm good now.
[139:54.54]I'm good.
[139:54.86]Oh, oh, oh.
[139:55.34]You immediately just killed him.
[139:56.78]What, he's dead?
[139:57.40]Oh.
[139:57.52]I thought we killed him.
[140:01.87]Alright, I gotta get some shit here.
[140:03.90]My gun is on the floor here somewhere.
[140:05.70]My stalwart.
[140:07.84]Where the hell did it go?
[140:10.72]God damn.
[140:11.10]Dude, I cannot do the Mortal Kombat fatality to do a fucking move.
[140:14.26]I swear to God.
[140:17.29]Yeah, I was gonna ask you if you wanted to play Magicka.
[140:21.21]Seven minutes before I can call that gun in.
[140:22.81]Did anyone get a stalwart gun?
[140:24.33]I'm gonna blow that.
[140:28.55]Oh, nice.
[140:28.83]If you have it, just enjoy.
[140:35.13]Back up.
[140:35.57]Back away.
[140:36.63]Back away.
[140:39.58]Good, good, good, good, good rocket.
[140:43.98]Oh, their armor's up.
[140:45.68]Oh, we got a big gooper!
[140:48.24]Behind you, V3!
[140:49.62]Oh.
[140:50.59]I'm dead again.
[140:56.75]I'm resing.
[140:59.03]Thank you.
[140:59.45]I res.
[141:03.14]try to angle my hell pod onto one of you guys.
[141:06.12]No, onto an enemy.
[141:07.62]Automatic pistol is really nice.
[141:09.41]It's good.
[141:11.51]Calling in orbital strike.
[141:13.93]I guess I'll pick one of these.
[141:16.47]Calling down a support weapon.
[141:20.84]Oh, that thing is quick and invisible.
[141:23.96]They're actually more visible when there's a lot of fog.
[141:28.90]Oh, there's my stalwart.
[141:34.34]I'm going to throw a cluster on the next pack.
[141:36.08]Dude.
[141:36.94]Oh, no, no.
[141:37.38]Ow, ow, ow.
[141:38.61]Collect encrypted hard drive data we're supposed to do here, I think.
[141:41.91]I don't know what that means or how to do that.
[141:46.87]I think we have to move to the next objective on the other side of the map.
[141:49.37]We got to go.
[141:50.93]So there's no objective here?
[141:52.19]I think we did the one that was here.
[141:54.49]All right.
[141:54.85]I got gassed.
[141:55.35]Oh, you're right.
[141:55.89]You're right.
[141:56.25]You're right.
[141:56.61]So, yeah, we want to.
[141:59.33]Oh, my God.
[141:59.67]That's far.
[142:00.43]All right.
[142:04.20]That is really far.
[142:05.20]You guys want to go to the pause menu and just tell stories and stuff?
[142:12.63]No.
[142:14.87]I have more Wildwood stories.
[142:19.26]I'm always down for a Wildwood story.
[142:20.88]It's very pretty.
[142:25.06]what does Wildwood mean it is a most recent Path of Exile expansion affliction you enter the Wildwood and you collect different essences and also it's a beach in New Jersey it's it yeah it's mainly a beach in New Jersey in my understanding but uh it's it's a boardwalk town in New Jersey but it's trashy well they based the Path of Exile expansion on the beach in New Jersey it's pure darkness and cockroaches everywhere
[142:49.85]It's also the beach that makes you old just by virtue of going there because you lose several years of your life by going to Wildwood.
[142:56.57]But we love it.
[142:57.41]We have memories of it, some of us.
[142:59.23]Wildwood has the aquarium, right?
[143:01.86]No, Point Pleasant has the aquarium.
[143:03.72]I'm thinking of Seaside.
[143:04.62]They're all the same.
[143:05.52]Like, they all...
[143:07.41]Seaside has a Jersey Shore, like, store that is, like, devoted to the Jersey Shore crew and cast.
[143:15.16]I'm sorry, Jerma, that every time it comes back to Jersey Shore towns when me and Stur are playing games, like, every time.
[143:22.00]Stop making meaningful relationship and friend relationship things happening.
[143:28.57]Stop being so meaningful and knowing each other better.
[143:31.27]Stur's my friend.
[143:33.92]Oh, so you want to talk about some fucking Boston shit?
[143:36.14]Yeah!
[143:37.32]I love Boston.
[143:38.06]I go there every year.
[143:39.73]How you doing?
[143:41.77]Shit's cold.
[143:45.45]Did anyone else see bad bobble here?
[143:48.17]I don't worry about it.
[143:50.14]What's that one pizza place in Boston?
[143:54.02]There's a lot of good pizza places in Boston, but New York just doesn't even come close.
[144:05.07]German, did I tell you Sleep No More is closing?
[144:06.93]Did we talk about that?
[144:08.45]No.
[144:09.69]That thing we went to.
[144:10.53]Yeah, that's closing.
[144:11.78]That place was fucking crazy.
[144:13.52]Been up for like 12 years and now finally it's shutting down.
[144:16.40]It was awesome though.
[144:17.12]Yeah, it was fun.
[144:27.23]Can we buy a car with our credits?
[144:30.53]yeah seriously helldivers one had vehicles and they said they wouldn't be in this game on launch there might be one that they showed in the trailer but I don't know that's a gas orbital you know be careful we're not even at the objective and he's trying to gas us uh this apparently oh I just used my head off oh my god
[144:58.96]Oh, that's bad.
[144:59.58]Whatever that is, I don't like it.
[145:02.20]Oh, that was so brutal.
[145:04.20]That was horrible.
[145:06.95]Oh, Jesus.
[145:10.31]Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[145:11.63]I'm putting a big bomb.
[145:14.49]Big bomb.
[145:15.22]You might die.
[145:15.92]Oh, you're good.
[145:17.70]I got you.
[145:28.13]Why did I do that?
[145:28.93]I always I'm pressing the wrong button.
[145:31.04]I try to call in stuff.
[145:31.96]I press alt and I dive.
[145:33.10]Ready to liberate.
[145:36.78]Oh my God, I thought I just killed Poke.
[145:38.14]That scared me.
[145:38.96]That was like the biggest gaming scare I've had in a long time.
[145:42.34]You need to play Tarkov.
[145:42.98]Give me this thing.
[145:46.34]Alright, so where's the actual objective?
[145:50.80]Just up here?
[145:52.24]Open your map.
[145:53.82]I just I'm doing it.
[145:55.78]Oh my God.
[145:58.51]Go on over here.
[146:02.19]There's like an infinitely bouncing piece of, like, detritus.
[146:06.48]What are you guys doing?
[146:08.52]There's a whole bunch of bugs coming, you fuckers.
[146:11.94]You got the reinforcements or no?
[146:13.68]Okay.
[146:14.36]I got one.
[146:14.88]We're limit testing.
[146:16.68]Yeah, we're just doing some experiments.
[146:17.70]The bugs don't see us.
[146:19.36]Don't shoot them.
[146:19.82]Don't shoot them.
[146:20.26]They don't see us.
[146:22.36]Oops.
[146:23.34]Now they do, but I got a minefield on the way.
[146:25.59]Poke and I are playing gaming Mythbusters, dude.
[146:28.50]Guys, be aware that there's a minefield there.
[146:30.68]There is now a giant minefield on the map.
[146:35.24]Vinny's trying to get his player damage in for the round.
[146:38.32]Someone's leg is just spinning at me.
[146:41.76]I had the spinning leg thing too.
[146:44.04]It's just... It's just spinning in my face.
[146:49.78]Do we all see it?
[146:51.16]I don't know.
[146:54.82]It's like aiming and there's a leg.
[146:57.72]So dumb.
[146:58.04]I want to see the fun leg.
[147:00.14]It might be client side, but... Oh, there it is.
[147:02.76]You know the leg group chat?
[147:04.20]No, I see it.
[147:04.68]The spinning leg group chat.
[147:06.80]There it goes.
[147:07.48]Yeah, and that group chat... We downloaded some data.
[147:11.50]...is we all write one message that says, oh, holy shit, you see that leg?
[147:15.95]And then that's it.
[147:16.99]We never type in there ever again.
[147:20.97]Worth having a thousand Discord groups just for stuff like that.
[147:26.18]The leg chat.
[147:29.76]There's still a minefield out there somewhere.
[147:31.51]I don't know where all that stuff is.
[147:33.01]Good orbital.
[147:34.67]Good orbital.
[147:35.65]Rocket launcher if somebody wants it.
[147:55.89]Okay, guys, we gotta go.
[147:56.89]I'm carrying something.
[147:58.07]I can only use my pistol.
[147:59.11]We need to go north.
[147:59.81]Team?
[148:00.51]Oh, okay.
[148:02.51]The team and the hard drive.
[148:04.19]Coming.
[148:10.26]I like the snow deformation when you dive into it.
[148:13.36]Why?
[148:13.64]Why?
[148:14.66]Who did that?
[148:16.50]Jesus Christ!
[148:17.95]Wait, who did that?
[148:20.07]Wait, was it me?
[148:21.41]It was you.
[148:22.29]I think you're the only one that has that.
[148:23.77]No, no, no.
[148:24.05]I didn't even click.
[148:25.15]I swear I didn't even click.
[148:28.89]Wait.
[148:29.59]I think I died seven times this round.
[148:31.99]No, no, no.
[148:34.11]My gamer reaction saved my life.
[148:36.29]I was right under it and dove.
[148:38.19]Wait a second.
[148:38.89]I think.
[148:40.63]I didn't even click.
[148:43.33]I climbed up a bush accidentally.
[148:45.49]Wait.
[148:52.04]If anyone finds a stalwart on the ground, just use it.
[148:54.45]It's good.
[148:55.21]Oh, if you ragdoll, you drop the stratagem on your hand.
[149:00.79]And I dropped it on the floor.
[149:01.95]That makes sense.
[149:04.37]I love these rocket launchers.
[149:05.32]They're super powerful and they're super cool.
[149:09.30]I'm happy for you, Jeremy.
[149:12.46]Okay, I have the hard drive again.
[149:14.08]There's ammo here.
[149:14.90]I gotta find where to plug this in.
[149:23.76]around here.
[149:27.19]Does anybody have eyes?
[149:29.53]On what?
[149:29.91]I don't know where I need to put this.
[149:33.65]I don't know either.
[149:37.69]Did you say mines?
[149:38.65]Yeah, I said mines.
[149:43.89]Fire in the hole!
[149:46.85]Reload, please.
[149:47.61]Come on, orbital strike.
[149:48.46]Get in there.
[149:48.86]Get in there.
[149:50.54]Damn it.
[149:52.84]Still worked.
[150:06.15]Give me that machine gun.
[150:06.99]I don't have to aim with this one.
[150:13.57]Somebody just drop a bomb on me.
[150:16.47]Could have been my grenade.
[150:17.35]Could have been minefield incoming.
[150:23.45]Yeah, we'll see.
[150:25.95]Might be me.
[150:27.89]Uh, Vinny, you see where we're putting this?
[150:29.88]Like, on the map, it's right here.
[150:31.56]I don't see anything.
[150:34.64]Vinny's still gonna do better.
[150:36.76]Collect the hard drive.
[150:37.76]Where's the hard drive now?
[150:38.74]I just mined the whole area and I don't see anything.
[150:42.20]There's a waste of mines.
[150:43.13]Holy fuck.
[150:46.99]Hard drive.
[150:47.53]Let me take a look.
[150:48.35]I have the hard drive.
[150:49.69]We need to upload the data.
[150:52.97]Upload the data.
[150:53.67]What the fuck, dude?
[150:57.92]Is there a cave that goes under here or anything?
[150:59.70]Oh, that kind of hurt my stomach.
[151:05.60]Chat, where do we... Communications relay wherever that is, I'm being told.
[151:09.76]Dude, I bumped into the fucking coffee table and it freaked me out, so I walked in.
[151:17.50]There is a relay over there, it's not where the marker is.
[151:20.04]Yeah, it's not.
[151:20.60]Chat, is it here?
[151:26.65]It's to the south, my chat's telling me.
[151:28.17]Machine gun.
[151:32.96]Terminate illegal broadcast.
[151:35.84]We're in the wrong place.
[151:36.78]So is it upload data via local relay?
[151:40.14]Orange icon.
[151:40.82]Orange icon.
[151:41.38]All right, I'll just follow you.
[151:45.69]Oh my god!
[151:47.75]Help!
[151:48.85]Help!
[151:49.47]What, what, what, what, what?
[151:50.33]There's mines everywhere!
[151:53.41]I don't know why you went that way, but that's cool.
[151:57.68]Uh, I'm just gonna... I'm dead.
[152:00.07]Oh... Wait, no, I'm not dead.
[152:01.13]You walked on one.
[152:02.09]It knocked me over.
[152:04.31]This is, uh... Well, there's a bunch of enemies.
[152:06.57]Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
[152:07.65]I shouldn't have done that.
[152:08.21]Let them come to the mines.
[152:09.95]What the... Why am I slipping?
[152:11.87]What the hell was that?
[152:13.95]We don't have a lot of reinforcements left.
[152:16.62]Oh, my God.
[152:17.14]I just slipped on the ice.
[152:18.38]Oh, we're good.
[152:20.22]Okay.
[152:24.38]I'm so sorry.
[152:25.16]I won't mine the area ever again.
[152:28.71]Until next time.
[152:29.57]Alright, where are the enemies coming from?
[152:31.79]Oh, they're gone now.
[152:34.19]Okay, good.
[152:34.57]There's no enemies, there are only mines.
[152:40.21]Close competition between Vinny and Poke for friendly fire champ this round.
[152:43.92]I honestly, I kind of hope I died ten times.
[152:48.74]That's kind of a record, I think.
[152:51.60]We only have three reinforcers.
[152:52.46]You were on the spot as a cube-like yellow object?
[152:55.62]Yellow and purple item?
[152:56.66]What are you talking about?
[152:59.88]It's all the way to the south.
[153:01.15]Something's pointing me that way, I think.
[153:02.63]Star, is there a floating box in the sky?
[153:06.65]I see a drop, like a ship up there.
[153:10.03]Looking around.
[153:11.73]Thank you for the supplies.
[153:16.13]Guys, we're going to fail this mission.
[153:18.89]Where are we going?
[153:19.37]I don't know where we're going.
[153:20.07]You guys are walking into like the giant red zone right now.
[153:23.48]That is not where we are going.
[153:24.88]All right.
[153:25.78]Good news, guys.
[153:26.50]My anti-personnel minefield has cooled down and I have it again.
[153:31.76]Okay, watch out.
[153:32.42]There's another minefield here.
[153:33.90]Vinny.
[153:37.18]We only have three more lives.
[153:40.59]I'm rosy.
[153:41.05]All right, the music is playing.
[153:49.75]Oh, Vinny.
[153:51.61]Why is there a thousand of these things?
[153:54.60]I don't know, Pope.
[153:56.56]They last forever, too.
[153:57.94]I don't know.
[154:00.18]It was right on top of a drop tube.
[154:01.82]I'm just going to stir.
[154:02.72]I'm just running to stir.
[154:04.30]Yeah, let's go to stir.
[154:05.08]We can't die anymore.
[154:10.61]You got like a little base camp over here.
[154:13.81]I'm using my orbital strike to try and clear the mines.
[154:19.83]I'm not using the mines again.
[154:20.91]I'm not.
[154:21.23]I'm just not.
[154:21.69]I'm at last res because we have one more or two more.
[154:24.67]Wait.
[154:27.17]I'm following stir, I think, because you know what you're doing.
[154:32.27]I don't.
[154:33.37]Oh, the orange thing.
[154:34.25]Yeah, we're here, right?
[154:35.07]Yeah.
[154:39.07]If you guys want to res, it's up to you.
[154:41.45]And we have to bring it south.
[154:43.95]Oh, I see.
[154:44.39]I got you.
[154:45.81]I'm assuming because it's like showing an arrow pointing me in a direction on the map.
[154:49.65]Machine gun.
[154:50.27]Good, good, good.
[154:53.78]It's a sentry.
[154:54.46]It was a little too late.
[154:55.62]Somebody use a res.
[154:56.26]I'm just going to say it.
[154:57.96]I got it.
[155:00.76]A res would be cool, but no pressure.
[155:04.68]All right.
[155:04.88]Nobody else died.
[155:05.60]We only have one more.
[155:06.59]You're leveling up the mines?
[155:13.17]Wait, should we?
[155:13.95]Yeah.
[155:16.07]We're going to need a poke and germa to come with us.
[155:21.12]You got it.
[155:25.85]This better be the right way.
[155:27.15]I can't get the whole zoomed out map.
[155:29.61]It won't get me that map either.
[155:30.85]Yeah.
[155:32.81]You can hold.
[155:39.44]Oh, you can slide.
[155:40.10]That was cool.
[155:40.80]White point in the east.
[155:42.00]Same symbol as the one in the top right is what I'm being told.
[155:46.54]White point to the east.
[155:49.54]I don't see what you're saying.
[155:51.80]I see it.
[155:52.36]It's on the total other side of the map.
[155:56.34]Is that a marker?
[155:58.50]I don't know how to put a marker on the map.
[156:01.34]We got to go far.
[156:02.46]100% east.
[156:03.95]There's like a grayed out symbol.
[156:05.43]That's the same symbol I'm carrying.
[156:06.87]It's kind of grayed out.
[156:08.21]It really was.
[156:08.81]You have to click the hard drive and take it there.
[156:10.61]The problem is it was grayed out, so it didn't look like something we had to do.
[156:13.83]It looks like it's done.
[156:16.39]Poke, I'm slash following you.
[156:17.69]I just got to bear back.
[156:22.88]Wait, slash following?
[156:24.80]Yeah, it's a thing.
[156:45.58]How do I do it?
[156:47.56]Tell me I can hover over the map, but I don't know how to open up the map.
[156:50.98]Are you in the group chat?
[156:52.08]Slash follow.
[156:54.22]No, I'm not in the group chat.
[157:03.34]I said to cut my nails.
[157:04.02]You absolute fuckers.
[157:08.04]Did you actually type slash?
[157:09.22]Oh, you did.
[157:14.60]Because I play games where that exists, so.
[157:17.65]Slash follow.
[157:35.74]There's bugs coming behind you guys.
[157:38.12]I got this minefield.
[157:39.10]Put an orbital behind us.
[157:41.62]Run.
[157:41.80]This way.
[157:42.44]I thought that was... Run, run, run, run.
[157:49.11]I thought that was... I had the wrong thing equipped.
[157:52.05]They're going to get my rocket launchers and use them again.
[157:53.85]They're going to get mines.
[157:56.59]Hell yeah, son.
[157:58.37]Yeah, there you go.
[157:59.61]Now that's an effective minefield.
[158:03.07]Calling in orbital strike.
[158:08.30]oh yes what this is bad bad smell slow hair for frodo
[158:42.73]like really craving macaroni and cheese right now but like real macaroni and cheese with like a burnt crust you're gonna want to watch my next stream vinny when is that when when do you have it okay just tell tell me when that happens like or maybe someone in my chat tell me because germ is busy I'm doing a macaroni and cheese review taste test tier list
[159:06.04]from like seven to ten of the most popular mac and cheese brands.
[159:09.40]Dude, I miss Jermis season one.
[159:11.84]Cabot Farms.
[159:13.30]Is that what that's called?
[159:16.00]Is that a good one?
[159:17.81]Chat, is there one called Cabot Farms?
[159:21.31]Wait, Ster, are you talking about like live commentary TF2?
[159:26.21]I just miss like, you know, Jermis season one, like before it got all convoluted.
[159:34.84]Eating mac and cheese on stream is convoluted.
[159:37.78]Yeah, the producers didn't feel like they had to do all this weird shit and they would just play like, I don't know, like Helldivers.
[159:45.85]Um, I do a lot of, like, yeah, weird food stuff, too.
[159:49.67]I did the Gordon Ramsay microwave meals.
[159:51.39]This dude's coming in with, ah, we're going to eat mac and cheese.
[159:54.42]Wait, Vinny, did you say that you also did, like, mac and cheese?
[159:57.70]I did Gordon Ramsay frozen meals.
[159:59.92]I didn't do mac and cheese.
[160:01.11]I missed Vinny's season one.
[160:02.07]Fuck off.
[160:07.47]No, there's Cabot Farms.
[160:08.93]Germa is a box mac and cheese that I heard was really good.
[160:13.33]I tried it, and I think it's quite good.
[160:15.63]Really?
[160:15.91]Okay.
[160:16.29]So try that, see if you like it.
[160:17.60]I'll put it on the list for sure.
[160:19.04]Is the thing alive?
[160:22.20]No, I think that thing is bugged.
[160:23.54]Wait, no, it is.
[160:25.30]Wait, I'm going to bomb it.
[160:28.24]You sure?
[160:29.28]I'll bomb it.
[160:30.78]Orbital precision strike.
[160:33.90]Ugh.
[160:36.71]Is that going to hit us?
[160:38.13]I miss.
[160:44.93]Seems bugged.
[160:48.97]It's alive.
[160:50.57]Going over here.
[160:52.47]That's a good turret, Vinny.
[160:54.97]Replacement?
[160:56.03]Yeah, man.
[160:56.85]All of your stratagems are like team killers, though.
[161:00.71]They are.
[161:00.97]Yes, they are.
[161:04.94]Going for the TK champ.
[161:07.25]Title.
[161:09.45]Run away from that.
[161:11.39]Title.
[161:20.34]Everything seems to be under control.
[161:24.82]Mines.
[161:26.62]Why?
[161:27.90]No, they're not going to reach us.
[161:28.94]They're not going to reach us.
[161:31.55]Just don't go in them.
[161:38.66]Sounds easy.
[161:43.74]Resupply right here.
[161:52.21]Just let him walk through the mines.
[161:54.59]This actually is going to work.
[161:55.43]Big boy's going to go through the mines.
[161:56.84]It's going to be awesome.
[162:04.24]It didn't work.
[162:04.66]It's not working.
[162:05.24]It's not working.
[162:05.76]It's not working.
[162:06.48]He didn't activate the mines.
[162:07.44]What the hell?
[162:07.96]He's coming up here.
[162:09.40]That's not good.
[162:13.04]There's a second one.
[162:14.00]Oh, everyone jump.
[162:14.72]Everyone jump.
[162:15.30]Everyone jump.
[162:16.46]Not in the mines.
[162:17.38]Don't go in the mines.
[162:23.61]He's behind me.
[162:25.87]What happened?
[162:26.83]Where am I?
[162:28.39]What's going on to my body?
[162:33.05]oh what's happening oh god I oh god there's only one reinforced left I hope you get something it bounced off his head and I'm sorry that was my fault that was my bad it was me I got crushed I'm so sorry how did you guys die did was it my minds or what it's me it's just you um I threw a grenade I'm back why am I back no I'm not back I'm dead collect encrypted data
[163:07.51]That was a Dwayne moment.
[163:08.67]It was.
[163:09.01]Poke, you got this.
[163:14.49]I think you just have to get to that console somehow, right?
[163:17.31]No, it does randomly put you on your body, I think, when your corpse gets shot.
[163:24.27]There is a cooldown in a minute and 20 seconds for reinforcement.
[163:27.90]Oops, I missed that.
[163:29.16]So if you just live a little.
[163:30.42]No, no, no, we have zero.
[163:31.88]No, I know, but this cooldown, we get one.
[163:35.28]One comes back.
[163:36.75]You sure?
[163:37.71]Maybe.
[163:38.05]It looks like it.
[163:39.49]One minute.
[163:39.79]We need more mines.
[163:41.01]Alright, poke.
[163:45.48]So we're gonna... I'm just gonna run away.
[163:48.86]Where's that computer terminal?
[163:52.82]Uh, it was on the hill we were defending.
[164:05.32]Is this telling me that I have a broken limb?
[164:07.82]I think I have a lot more problems than that.
[164:10.86]Yeah.
[164:22.11]Upload data.
[164:28.76]15 seconds, Polk.
[164:29.24]You got it.
[164:31.50]You got this.
[164:32.20]You're in a good spot right now, Polk.
[164:33.94]We believe in you.
[164:35.71]You're really cute.
[164:45.54]There it is.
[164:45.94]Don't get the pepper jack or the bacon one for Cabot.
[164:50.92]Yeah, what I'm doing is I'm doing just if it's not cheddar or sharp cheddar, it's not on the list.
[164:55.26]You need to need to be fair.
[164:59.14]I think you'll like the Cabot just regular.
[165:02.83]Because there's different types of mac and cheese.
[165:04.77]There's frozen.
[165:05.43]There's box.
[165:07.85]There's stuff that's a little more elaborate.
[165:09.23]But if you just want a quick mac and cheese, I think Cabot Farms is my favorite.
[165:15.08]I have a favorite, but I'm not going to say it because I could be proven wrong on this stream.
[165:18.46]There you go.
[165:19.92]This is awesome.
[165:21.30]You got this.
[165:30.46]you and you and stir can are gonna like extract it's gonna be awesome all right I'm running to it bug breach bug bridge where is it oh wait that's what extract it's on the other side of a map great value orbital
[166:00.29]And we need to try and stay alive so we can get the other resurrects.
[166:06.13]Stay behind.
[166:07.64]Don't go behind.
[166:08.20]Don't go there.
[166:09.46]There are a lot of bugs coming towards you guys from over here.
[166:12.74]A lot.
[166:13.30]Nice.
[166:13.94]Nice airstrike.
[166:14.86]There are a hundred more after that poke, by the way.
[166:17.10]Just be careful.
[166:20.60]I think, yeah, you guys probably want to make a break for it.
[166:28.60]you're alone I know oh also it's like very cold out yeah and it's the snow is it's like maybe slowing you down can you spectate I don't think you actually can you can but then it seems like it bugs and it gets stuck on your corpse sometimes are you guys just potatoed um yeah uh yeah get someone back hell yeah son
[166:56.95]I don't want to keep calling people son.
[166:59.41]Sorry about that.
[167:00.41]Yeah, son.
[167:01.65]Weird.
[167:02.93]Oh, I had a friend that said that for years, so it's just a part of my DNA now.
[167:06.81]Thank you.
[167:08.20]Get the heck out of here.
[167:09.16]Let's go, bro.
[167:26.83]Just go dad.
[167:33.76]Now I had a dad, I used to call him that for years.
[167:35.48]I don't know.
[167:36.48]Stuck with me.
[167:40.40]I wonder how many credits we're going to get for this one.
[167:45.15]If mission length is any indication, I'm going to guess like 15.
[167:50.17]You guys got some big... Oh god, that's a lot.
[167:54.09]Run, just run, run, run.
[167:54.85]I'll do an orbital.
[167:56.98]Dura, be careful over there.
[167:57.80]I just threw one.
[167:58.24]I know.
[167:59.66]Thank you, mommy.
[168:00.42]Ooh.
[168:06.19]I think we're okay.
[168:08.21]Now, do you still have to wait for the extraction, like, two minutes, right?
[168:10.35]Oh, shit.
[168:10.51]Almost hit the flower.
[168:11.37]Yes.
[168:12.19]Almost touched the flower.
[168:13.31]Should we just wait this 40 seconds for Vinny?
[168:16.47]Holy shit.
[168:17.65]There's, like, seven bug holes here.
[168:18.53]I think we could make it.
[168:20.09]I think we could make it a minefield.
[168:21.19]I think we're better off just pressing it and then... Requesting advanced weaponry.
[168:25.17]What do you think?
[168:26.85]I say wait 10 seconds, then press it.
[168:30.09]Press it.
[168:30.77]Oh my God, Stir, why are you over there?
[168:32.65]Stir, you're too far.
[168:34.79]I am aware.
[168:35.51]Oh, that's a lot.
[168:37.95]I pressed it.
[168:41.85]Back up, poke a little.
[168:45.58]Oh my God, Stir.
[168:46.06]Stir!
[168:51.16]Holy shit.
[168:51.77]Okay.
[168:52.93]Okay.
[168:53.21]Have a rez.
[168:53.69]Have a rez.
[168:54.33]I'm rezing.
[168:55.31]Rez.
[168:56.31]Hell yeah.
[169:01.35]Rez is rez.
[169:02.03]Hey, hey, hey.
[169:04.40]What's up?
[169:04.72]It'll be me.
[169:05.22]It might be me.
[169:06.12]I'm not sure.
[169:07.22]Yeah, it's me.
[169:07.96]Be careful.
[169:12.84]I'm dropping a bunch of shit.
[169:13.84]All right.
[169:14.92]That's a bad orbital.
[169:20.42]That was a great orbital poke.
[169:22.16]Holy smokes.
[169:22.76]Where am I throwing the minefield?
[169:23.78]I'm gonna throw it in there.
[169:24.90]That distance over there.
[169:25.84]Okay.
[169:26.12]And I'm gonna do a turret as well.
[169:27.46]Alright.
[169:29.65]Turret.
[169:33.25]Okay.
[169:34.65]Need the stall wart.
[169:40.63]And, uh, orbital.
[169:41.91]I'll do an orbital.
[169:51.75]Hell yeah.
[169:52.39]Hell yeah.
[169:53.43]Hell yeah.
[169:54.09]Helldivers.
[169:54.79]Helldivers.
[169:56.85]By now, on the Sony PlayStation Store, Steam, Xbox... Write a Battle Pass, Joe.
[170:07.57]Excellent work, Helldivers!
[170:11.44]Have you reached the extraction point?
[170:13.26]Did my minefield not work?
[170:16.20]I think you threw your minefield out and then orbitaled it.
[170:19.54]Oh, that can happen?
[170:21.60]Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right, actually, yeah.
[170:27.72]Those bullet casings are like glitched looking.
[170:31.66]We're good.
[170:52.41]You wait to res or no?
[170:54.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[170:55.01]Reinforced her.
[170:55.67]I'll get it.
[170:58.99]I got it.
[170:59.21]I got it.
[171:02.10]There's more.
[171:05.24]Take that res.
[171:07.42]I'm going to land on the ship.
[171:13.55]My Boba Fett is shooting a big machine gun.
[171:16.43]I love it.
[171:23.62]Oh no.
[171:27.90]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[171:29.08]I just want to make sure I get like 10 more kills so you don't make fun of me at the end of the mission.
[171:35.65]Okay, let's go.
[171:38.87]Wow, you, wow.
[171:40.20]Like .20 seconds.
[171:50.33]They should have left you.
[171:51.89]What number meal are you?
[171:53.57]My chat wants to know.
[171:54.61]What meal?
[171:55.67]Number two.
[171:56.39]What combo meal?
[171:57.37]Number two?
[172:03.31]Speaking of meals, I haven't eaten dinner.
[172:05.77]I'm down for one more quick one.
[172:07.31]Is that cool?
[172:09.17]How much more do you guys want to do?
[172:11.71]I'll see you guys next time.
[172:13.21]This is my birthday game.
[172:16.70]Do one more.
[172:18.60]Yeah, Vinny, on the birthday invitation, it said we were playing till like 11 o'clock Pacific tonight.
[172:23.05]That's like another seven or eight hours.
[172:25.03]My birthday doesn't end until midnight, yeah.
[172:28.55]Oh.
[172:28.81]Yeah, because that's 1159 p.m.
[172:34.38]Chat, don't actually believe that it's Daryl's birthday.
[172:37.06]We don't know that.
[172:38.18]There's actually literally no way of knowing that.
[172:44.73]It is?
[172:48.55]Wait, it really is?
[172:50.67]I would do literally anything for you on your birthday.
[172:54.71]Vinny, it's not his birthday.
[172:56.23]I'm gonna just... Don't worry.
[172:58.49]He's just trolling you.
[172:59.01]Let me type slash follow in the chat to find out if it's his birthday.
[173:00.97]You could give me any command on your birthday.
[173:05.09]All right, well, hang out at Jersey Shore with me then.
[173:08.11]Okay, so I died nine times.
[173:09.77]Let's see how many... Yeah, where are the team kills?
[173:17.91]Okay.
[173:19.75]Vinny, me and you had a lot of team damage.
[173:23.97]Yeah.
[173:26.37]Yeah.
[173:28.62]Like over 2k team damage for me.
[173:30.40]Do we have 100 health?
[173:30.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[173:37.78]I don't know how much health we have, but 2151 team damage seems impressive.
[173:43.62]Poke has four accidentals, and then you have zero friendly fire damage.
[173:48.11]How does that work out?
[173:49.03]Did we get, like, no war bonds for that?
[173:53.95]I just hit my face with my headset.
[174:03.78]You got three?
[174:05.12]Three's not... Like, for how long that mission is, I feel like that's kind of a shitty amount.
[174:09.90]Like, we should probably have, like, 40.
[174:11.15]Oh, well.
[174:17.65]Friendly fire damage is bugged, apparently.
[174:21.53]I did zero.
[174:22.21]Vinny did 2,000.
[174:22.61]There's a laser cannon.
[174:27.11]Pretty neato.
[174:29.45]Diet Coke.
[174:30.17]Do you guys like Diet Coke?
[174:33.41]I don't drink soda same same what do you mean same you just you just cracked what cold one no I drink the mini cans to make myself feel better I I have labeled one soda every three months or a ginger I guess I drink ginger ale so I I never mind I drink soda never mind wait same guys we just did a challenging mode and got eight medals for that I got three
[175:02.29]Should we just be buying shit?
[175:03.97]Do we have to unlock the next page or something?
[175:07.25]Yeah, you buy stuff to unlock the next page and then buy more to unlock the next page until you find meaning in your life.
[175:13.17]Okay.
[175:14.82]I hate this system.
[175:16.18]Oh, right here.
[175:17.04]I see.
[175:17.72]I'm going to get the cape.
[175:25.49]Laser cannon.
[175:26.43]Yeah, I like the sound of that laser cannon.
[175:27.93]Did you buy that, Ster?
[175:29.27]I did not.
[175:29.83]I'm saving my money.
[175:30.75]Oh, I can't get it either.
[175:32.15]I want to get, like, the napalm strike or something.
[175:33.99]Oh, wait.
[175:34.54]The marksman passive is sick for the armor.
[175:38.10]It is.
[175:38.48]It reduces recoil by 30%.
[175:40.46]I got that.
[175:41.82]It's awesome.
[175:42.40]And 50% resistance to explosives.
[175:44.96]Ooh, this thing looks cool.
[175:45.78]That's big.
[175:47.73]Vinny, do you prefer your Pepsi mixed with milk or neat?
[175:53.17]Huh.
[175:55.76]Pepsi.
[175:56.78]Let me think about that a little bit.
[175:58.74]All right, Coke or Pepsi?
[175:59.72]That's an easy one for this group.
[176:01.28]Coke or Pepsi?
[176:03.32]Two of us already said we don't drink soda.
[176:05.71]But you've had it before.
[176:07.87]Diet Coke.
[176:10.09]Cherry Coke.
[176:12.13]Does that count?
[176:12.65]Or is it just like we're doing original flavor versus original flavor?
[176:15.43]Yeah, so you prefer Coke over Pepsi?
[176:18.49]I guess so, yeah.
[176:20.27]I barely remember what they taste like.
[176:21.77]That's different, but sure.
[176:29.70]I would really rather, like, if you spit in a glass of water, I'd drink that.
[176:33.50]That's sick, bro.
[176:35.90]Really?
[176:36.40]What do you drink, Ster?
[176:37.82]You drink water?
[176:39.34]I'm a waterer.
[176:40.70]It's most of my body.
[176:42.31]Okay, how about this?
[176:44.43]Best water?
[176:45.01]New York City tap water?
[176:55.37]Uh, out of the hose.
[176:57.51]Because I really think there's a lot of room for error.
[177:00.83]I'm a Fiji enjoyer.
[177:02.69]I think Fiji is just an S+, but it's on its own category, I think.
[177:07.36]Yeah.
[177:08.68]Did you know that New York City water in the fountains, like, say, if you go to a park, like Central Park, and you go to a water fountain, there's, like, tiny shrimps in the water, I just found out.
[177:20.40]Oh, Fiji.
[177:21.79]Yeah, protein.
[177:22.77]It's real.
[177:23.11]There was some article about that.
[177:24.15]There's, like, tiny little shrimps.
[177:31.63]I don't like seafood that much.
[177:33.27]I don't like seafood.
[177:34.43]I was just thinking about it.
[177:36.39]Yeah, I don't think I would really prefer to have that.
[177:38.61]I don't eat seafood, really, but...
[177:41.95]I mean, hey, protein.
[177:43.27]I like salmon.
[177:43.77]Salmon's good.
[177:44.25]I think salmon's a nice grilled piece of salmon or baked salmon.
[177:49.41]Yeah, but I'm talking about like crab legs and stuff like that.
[177:52.39]I don't really care for that.
[177:53.51]It's too much work for nothing.
[177:54.53]I like chowder.
[177:55.59]So when I go to Boston, I get the chowder.
[177:58.73]That was pretty good.
[177:59.60]That was a good accent, Vinny.
[178:02.58]Thank you.
[178:05.96]Look at that throw.
[178:06.74]Look how good this guy is.
[178:12.80]We already got a horde coming.
[178:16.54]Where do you need the mines?
[178:17.42]Just tell me.
[178:19.90]Nowhere.
[178:23.10]This is not needed.
[178:31.71]We should have done a different map.
[178:34.33]Uh, you have to, there's, the missions come in like twos.
[178:36.91]They're part of like a campaign.
[178:38.61]Where the hell is everybody?
[178:40.81]We're up on the roof.
[178:43.15]Oh, I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[178:47.50]Got you, Arma.
[178:49.16]What the fuck was that?
[178:50.20]It's your grenade.
[178:53.20]Don't.
[178:55.14]Don't until you pass your training.
[178:57.14]There's a minefield ahead of you, sir, so you might want to be careful.
[179:00.18]Big guy, big guy, big guy, big guy, big guy behind us.
[179:08.87]Uh-oh.
[179:10.35]Wow.
[179:10.59]I got you.
[179:10.85]You just got trampled.
[179:12.25]Well, I couldn't walk forward because there was mines, but someone has to close the holes.
[179:17.73]Oh, shit.
[179:18.15]Holes?
[179:18.95]There's mines in front of the bug holes.
[179:21.95]I don't know how to get down from here safely.
[179:24.51]Oh, now I do.
[179:28.57]There's only one thing I can do.
[179:29.85]Wait.
[179:30.59]I'm so sorry.
[179:33.11]I'm sorry.
[179:34.70]Oh, you're good.
[179:37.01]Wait, who else did I kill?
[179:38.65]Oh man, I am just a pile of meat.
[179:42.41]I'm dead.
[179:49.80]Here I come.
[179:50.84]I'm gonna die.
[179:51.48]Oh, that's a lot.
[180:00.84]I need the gas.
[180:01.52]Who's shooting them?
[180:02.80]To alert them!
[180:03.91]Requesting orbitals.
[180:06.37]Uh, what?
[180:06.81]Is that my fault?
[180:09.29]Oops.
[180:09.55]Are you talking about the big guys?
[180:13.45]No.
[180:14.83]I'm in like a blender.
[180:18.25]What are you doing?
[180:22.18]Are we going to close these terminals?
[180:28.61]Oh, this.
[180:29.15]Look at all this shit.
[180:30.01]Oh, I hope that doesn't hurt me.
[180:31.69]The bug hole!
[180:33.61]Yeah, the holes.
[180:34.33]I remember he said that.
[180:35.49]He told us about those.
[180:36.45]He did tell us them.
[180:42.50]He did tell us about those.
[180:48.64]I was going to get a hole and then I blew up.
[180:51.50]Yeah, because there's mines all over this place.
[180:57.71]I don't know where they- that's crazy.
[180:59.33]That's like a weird, like, challenge that shows up on a couple of maps.
[181:02.01]Oh god, mines!
[181:02.39]Where you just, like, put mines out, yeah.
[181:07.91]There's a dancing leg again.
[181:09.23]Dude, like I said, you're the type of person, you're the type of kid that jumps off the swing and fucks up your ankles.
[181:19.28]It's oddly specific.
[181:20.70]I added the- I added the F word there, I'm sorry.
[181:23.96]Oh.
[181:24.62]Get your newborn to get the fuck out now.
[181:29.43]Okay.
[181:29.65]What the hell is this thing?
[181:33.98]Some weird fucking glitches in this game.
[181:38.20]I've cleared the minefield that I created.
[181:39.66]I see the leg.
[181:40.48]I got the leg going on again.
[181:41.68]It's like break dancing.
[181:43.72]Poke, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[181:44.84]Behind you, there's a mine.
[181:45.68]I got it, I got it.
[181:48.56]Watch out, Poke!
[181:49.34]There's another mine.
[181:49.98]What?
[181:50.66]Oh, okay.
[181:58.97]Help!
[182:00.69]Okay, I'm here.
[182:01.39]I had to clear my minefield.
[182:02.63]Boy, that was a waste.
[182:04.77]Oh no, Stir, are you okay?
[182:08.00]That sounded genuine.
[182:09.38]There's a bug hole.
[182:11.72]Kill this thing!
[182:14.60]I'm going to the bug hole.
[182:24.10]Alright, we gotta kill these bug holes.
[182:28.00]I don't know where the other ones are, though.
[182:29.51]Like, are they on the map?
[182:33.57]I bet you were one of those kids with the snotty sleeves.
[182:36.95]No, no, no way.
[182:38.75]Short time limit.
[182:39.53]Oh, yeah, there's only seven minutes before we lose our reinforcements.
[182:42.33]Oh, you can change the zoom.
[182:44.47]We got to go south.
[182:45.67]If you have a sniper, you change the zoom.
[182:47.63]By the way.
[182:48.75]Hold R. We got to turn around, guys.
[182:52.62]Oh, my goodness.
[182:53.18]Thank you, Poke.
[182:54.32]I was wondering why I couldn't aim at this thing.
[183:00.08]We gotta go south, guys.
[183:01.22]Alright, okay.
[183:04.52]You can make your gun fire faster, Vinny.
[183:08.92]Huh?
[183:11.40]Anybody got a fucking stim pack?
[183:14.17]I got one.
[183:14.53]Can I heal you?
[183:19.99]Oh, the LMG.
[183:24.65]Oh my god, you're right.
[183:25.45]You can make it fire.
[183:26.21]How do you do that, though?
[183:26.95]Because it's mouse wheel.
[183:31.95]Right click.
[183:36.25]Is that a minefield?
[183:38.17]No, I'm not doing minefields without express.
[183:40.91]This is a bug hole mission.
[183:43.02]It's all about the boy's hole.
[183:46.74]Grab a rocket launcher.
[183:47.96]I don't like that sentence.
[183:50.08]Boy's soul.
[183:51.70]Soul.
[183:51.98]I know.
[183:52.26]I've watched Always Sunny as well.
[183:56.33]Chad, it's a reference to Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which is a show that has run on cable for many years now.
[184:04.10]I never watched it.
[184:04.82]Is that bad?
[184:05.50]You guys want some fog?
[184:06.74]That is bad.
[184:11.30]This fog is fucking horrendous.
[184:12.68]Oh no, I can't see shit.
[184:19.83]Prayer sample.
[184:23.99]I don't.
[184:24.89]Did I shoot my rocket launcher?
[184:26.85]OK, I didn't mean to do that.
[184:30.54]I'm just throwing an orbital over there.
[184:31.92]Fucking who cares?
[184:36.82]Bound to kill something.
[184:39.28]If I threw mines now, that would be bad, right?
[184:41.98]That would be the worst.
[184:43.82]Okay.
[184:46.91]That was my bad.
[184:49.69]Ooh, that sounded like I got a little bit with the gas.
[185:00.21]Throwing a cluster.
[185:04.09]Wait.
[185:05.27]We gotta clear these bug holes, I don't have grenades.
[185:07.53]Whey!
[185:08.33]Jeez, that got me real good there, lads.
[185:10.37]Okay, I'm just not using that again, honestly.
[185:12.85]I just retired that.
[185:13.73]Alright, let's find a... We gotta find the hole.
[185:16.95]Oh my goodness, I walked right into it.
[185:18.83]It was almost like I did it on purpose.
[185:21.79]Why did we pause it into the side of a cliff?
[185:25.48]Kinda weird.
[185:26.82]It was kinda weird.
[185:32.09]I actually kind of see up here.
[185:33.27]I don't see the hole.
[185:41.08]Is there even a hole?
[185:43.48]Yes.
[185:46.38]Oh.
[185:46.68]Yes.
[185:50.50]I just want these samples.
[185:53.22]Oh, my samples from before.
[185:54.59]Are these mines?
[185:55.21]No, not mine.
[185:55.85]I didn't set any.
[186:00.46]They learn from you, Vinny.
[186:01.94]Yeah, seriously.
[186:04.20]I've got them.
[186:05.58]Did someone secure my samples?
[186:08.34]Oh, I got it.
[186:09.24]All right.
[186:13.66]Wah!
[186:15.16]Oh, I almost... Ah!
[186:19.30]That was scary.
[186:24.08]I need my rocket launcher.
[186:25.50]This is perfect.
[186:26.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please.
[186:33.75]I think I had more fun with the rifle.
[186:35.69]Oh, that's bad.
[186:40.80]That's bad too.
[186:41.46]Don't do that.
[186:41.88]What are you guys doing?
[186:42.48]You're crazy.
[186:43.16]You're crazy, you bugs.
[186:46.67]If only there was a whole bunch of mines everywhere.
[186:49.65]Yeah.
[186:50.71]That'd slow these fuckers down.
[187:01.77]We need to get out of the fog.
[187:03.35]This is time.
[187:03.87]We gotta go a little bit to the west.
[187:05.49]There's another bug site.
[187:08.80]Two minutes.
[187:11.14]Jiggling.
[187:11.88]Move!
[187:13.46]I'm following you, Stir.
[187:14.52]Wherever you're going.
[187:15.66]I'm almost out of ammo.
[187:30.87]I thought there was more bugs, I'm sorry I got you back.
[187:57.02]Appreciate it.
[187:57.48]Thank you.
[187:58.30]That's a thousand team damage right there.
[188:00.00]I doubt we can do the rest of the objective, so we should just move towards extraction.
[188:05.95]Well, we only have two more holes left now.
[188:07.49]Do we know where they are?
[188:08.49]Yeah, they're too far away.
[188:10.67]Oh.
[188:12.63]Oh, my God.
[188:14.47]The heavy armor plus machine gun and you crouch, it's a it's a beam.
[188:31.43]I feel like this is like a fake ad game or something.
[188:53.20]This is like a fake video game where like the recoil is crazy and it's right down the middle like this.
[189:01.95]Huh?
[189:02.73]What does an eagle rearm do?
[189:03.81]Shit.
[189:03.93]Gonna need one of them reloads.
[189:18.51]There we go.
[189:20.31]I explained what I was trying to say very poorly, but hopefully somebody understood it.
[189:23.36]I kind of maybe understood.
[189:25.88]The video game that's in a video game.
[189:28.14]That's like, hey, look, somebody's playing a video game.
[189:31.02]It looks like this.
[189:34.63]Looks like this.
[189:37.47]Like the games and shows?
[189:38.81]Yeah.
[189:42.03]Like a game inside of another piece of media.
[189:46.57]Stratagem's unavailable.
[189:47.73]Extraction shuttle en route.
[189:49.21]Yeah.
[189:58.48]I should have called my stalwart.
[190:00.02]Oh man, I forgot to do that.
[190:06.23]So we're just NPCs playing this game?
[190:09.87]Yeah.
[190:10.73]I don't even feel like alive right now.
[190:14.95]We're Sims characters.
[190:16.99]It's kind of gaming with the boys, you know?
[190:20.89]I wish.
[190:21.97]Sims sound like they go... I wish I could just put a painting on my wall and solve all my problems.
[190:34.53]are you just prone whenever you want to z oops I thought it was all oh wow what are we waiting for waiting for extraction maybe we're still allowed to clear these bug holes we there's no reinforcement so I don't
[190:58.00]Yeah, we have no stratagems, no reinforcements, but we are allowed to do so.
[191:02.26]Well, you know what?
[191:02.87]No, it's not true because in the ship we leave.
[191:04.99]Poke, this is great.
[191:06.09]You're holding it upside down over behind your head.
[191:09.23]Like, you're not even trying.
[191:10.13]It's so funny.
[191:15.68]I like that one.
[191:16.36]Okay, aim at me, Poke.
[191:25.63]If you shot that gun like that, you would probably break your neck.
[191:31.03]That would recoil back and hit you right in the face.
[191:34.37]You'd probably break your spine.
[191:38.82]Oh, there's like stuff happening.
[191:46.94]I pulled a muscle, I can't move.
[191:49.04]Uh oh, he pulled a muscle!
[192:03.63]You guys ever play League of Legends?
[192:05.17]What is that?
[192:08.39]Really good game.
[192:11.93]I played League of Legends once.
[192:14.26]I played Defense of the Ancients.
[192:16.08]It's a Warcraft 3 custom map, I believe.
[192:19.10]Dude, do you ever play Darwin's Island?
[192:22.28]That's one of my favorite ones.
[192:24.64]And we like shake hands right now.
[192:26.81]So many times.
[192:29.05]Vinny, why has no one made, everybody makes all the, you know, there's so many dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota, dota.
[192:37.27]Stop.
[192:37.95]Yeah.
[192:38.29]Make fucking Darwin's Island a real game.
[192:41.08]Make Darwin's Island a real game.
[192:42.36]What's going on here?
[192:43.52]It was so good.
[192:44.46]It was so good.
[192:44.98]I recently, um, not recently, but within the past couple of years, I reinstalled Warcraft 3 and I just played a bunch of Darwin's Island.
[192:52.64]I'm surprised I didn't get the maps of it happening.
[192:54.57]Oh, I could imagine it.
[192:55.79]It was, it was awesome.
[193:01.79]There was quite a few of those Warcraft III mods that never got the kind of Dota treatment where everybody made a Dota league type game.
[193:10.33]Power defense also became its own thing too.
[193:12.17]Do you remember Hero Line War?
[193:14.89]I played that, yeah.
[193:16.67]I wish somebody would just make a game that is that.
[193:19.63]I feel like people would go crazy for it.
[193:25.60]You ever play Liero?
[193:27.54]yes actually liero is awesome it's funny now that you're actually excitedly talking about literally games that are fake games inside of a game that's a good point actually hey well uh dota was a fake game inside of a real game and look at it now how did we fail by the way it said mission failed we did we were shameful destroy all the holes and there was another side quest we could have done yeah the bug holes is
[193:57.56]welcome aboard helldiver so that was the like it's always these two with the friendly fire damage yeah yeah mine's yeah vinnie and poke yeah what's going on with you guys we have no war bonds for that now that you're here the war is as good as one oh okay if you want to unlock the last page you have to spend 1173 medals okay yeah so I'm saying that does not look like this is not
[194:27.92]appealing to grind no that makes me not want to grind that like I'm having fun playing the game moment to moment but that as a goal is just ridiculous there's no way how do you make your progression not look good that's not a good idea I wonder if there's gonna be like enough like people that hate that
[194:50.51]that they lower the requirements because again you do have to spend 40 bucks for the game it's not like it's a free fucking video game where you get to spend you know in-game currency whatever somebody said that I guess we get exponential more medals the more missions and harder it gets or something I don't know it's fine yeah but it's like it doesn't really like
[195:12.25]mean I wonder how many medals you get if like you finish a mission and like you don't kill yourselves like 20 times and run out of reinforcements he's not wrong there's like nine different difficulties too yeah it's just the live service thing like there's a subnautica 2 was like announced and there was an erroneous information about it being a live service multiplayer game
[195:37.32]And the devs were like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[195:39.41]No, it's not, not quite.
[195:41.95]But then there was a lot of discussion about it.
[195:43.97]Like how many live service games
[195:47.53]are people going to be able to pay for at one time?
[195:50.11]Like, two?
[195:51.03]Three?
[195:51.33]Like, how much time and money does one have to have to be playing games like this every fucking day?
[195:58.33]It's the subscription conundrum, right?
[196:00.35]It's like, oh, okay, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount+, HBO.
[196:04.67]It's like, we're... I don't have enough... Who has enough time to watch, like, fucking, like, 60,000 television shows?
[196:11.55]And then, like, load up a new app every show.
[196:14.43]Like...
[196:14.99]just combine or stop I don't know all right um what do you guys want to do uh do you want to do one more short one sir what do you think it's hard to tell if they're going to be short ones beforehand I mean I guess some of them have the timer so we could choose where you could do we could go back and do a robot one yeah all them you can get everything for free I'm down for robot one pretty sure I'll do one more robot one I've realized I'm I'm not as hungry as I thought I was um
[196:52.19]I'm gonna go back to the assault rifle.
[197:06.45]You forsook hunger for Stir's birthday.
[197:09.93]Is that canon now?
[197:10.87]It's like just canon that it's his birthday?
[197:15.98]Can I buy anything?
[197:17.02]I feel like I'm wasting money.
[197:18.66]I need to save it for something else.
[197:20.94]You have to buy to even use it on the better stuff anyway.
[197:24.05]Like, you have to spend to unlock more stuff.
[197:27.99]So yeah, I would buy.
[197:28.95]Planethrower's level 10?
[197:29.97]Come on, man.
[197:34.55]Make sure you get armor-piercing stuff.
[197:44.32]Does that count as vehicle armor?
[197:50.88]The gas is good for machines, I guess.
[197:54.69]Gas?
[197:55.69]Oh wait, maybe I should get the sniper for this.
[197:58.21]Shit.
[197:58.79]I'll get the sniper for this.
[198:11.16]You guys have the Twitch chat auto-mod thing on?
[198:19.94]No.
[198:22.56]No?
[198:24.36]I don't think so.
[198:25.83]I have Nightbot.
[198:29.64]It's like the weirdest thing to me.
[198:32.41]It automatically bans people.
[198:37.01]No, it shows their bad message and then it shows what kind of level it is.
[198:43.54]Oh.
[198:44.02]Like level of severity?
[198:45.40]Level two racism.
[198:46.22]Oh.
[198:47.40]It's like... It's just... Who set all these levels?
[198:53.11]You gotta rank up for level four.
[198:54.89]Level three and... Yeah, it's... It's... That's crazy.
[198:59.13]Level three.
[199:00.27]People grinding.
[199:01.21]Like, people are grinding out there.
[199:04.16]Level five.
[199:07.46]Ban maxing.

[199:33.65]I am a West Coast dork, so it is... I still have daytime, so I get it if you guys want to... I get it if time is getting to be of the essence.
[199:44.56]I'm going to die.
[199:45.14]I can't get off of this.
[199:52.42]Jump.
[199:54.32]Cool looking planet.
[199:56.48]You're cool.
[199:57.88]Thanks, man.
[199:58.64]I'm going to stay up here.

[200:52.84]Reload the gun!
[201:09.93]Oh my gosh.
[201:10.96]Oh my gosh.
[201:19.90]I'm throwing a... There's a lot of goons.
[201:24.43]City run!
[201:24.93]It's a goon squad.
[201:26.47]Alright.
[201:31.41]Ow.
[201:33.99]What the?
[201:36.85]Watch out.
[201:37.35]That's a cliff, guys.
[201:38.18]That's a cliff.
[201:39.22]Don't back up any further.
[201:41.08]Vinny, it's a cliff.
[201:41.82]Vinny, it's a cliff.
[201:42.74]Yeah, I fell off the cliff, too.
[201:43.70]We're good.
[201:43.98]We're good.
[201:44.26]We're good.
[201:44.60]Vinny, it's a cliff.
[201:53.18]Nobody up there, right?
[201:55.57]Corporal going up there.
[201:59.07]That was a bad sentry.
[202:00.11]I threw a bad sentry, guys.
[202:01.53]I'm very shamed.
[202:02.25]Oh, we got AT.
[202:03.33]AT.
[202:03.39]AT.
[202:07.62]Wait, this might kill you guys.
[202:12.51]Oh, shit.
[202:14.39]Yeah.
[202:15.03]This one might... A little.
[202:18.39]No way.
[202:19.71]The rage is so... Was there a restart?
[202:24.01]Where were you aiming?
[202:27.80]I'm sorry.
[202:28.24]Oh, I'm alive.
[202:28.96]Wait, what the fuck?
[202:30.66]I thought I was dead.
[202:32.20]This is a bad place to be.
[202:34.48]I'm a murderer.
[202:36.52]Oh dear, this is a very bad place to be.
[202:40.24]Return to combat zone.
[202:46.85]Get away from me!
[202:49.93]I feel like the sniper's not getting us either.
[202:56.24]I'm out of ammo.
[202:57.56]Oh god.
[202:59.10]Oh my goodness!
[203:02.56]I just dived.
[203:03.34]I dived so hard, I died.
[203:06.87]I got you.
[203:07.63]Okay.
[203:11.79]Holy shit.
[203:14.57]Oh, I get it.
[203:15.25]Hell divers.
[203:20.28]The robots have no chill.
[203:24.02]Ow.
[203:26.36]I've thrown that a little bit too far.
[203:28.94]Oh, God, behind us.
[203:29.64]Benny, be careful.
[203:32.74]That didn't kill it?
[203:33.66]What the fuck is the point of that weapon?
[203:39.10]I shot two rockets at this thing.
[203:40.46]They have single shot.
[203:45.20]What are you guys doing?
[203:46.32]What just happened to me?
[203:49.03]I'm alive!
[203:51.25]Did you just... Did you just corporal yourself?
[203:53.69]It wasn't me.
[203:54.17]No, no, no.
[203:54.35]It wasn't me.
[203:54.79]No.
[203:55.67]That wasn't actually me.
[203:59.28]Ster, can we get a res... Oh, that's not you.
[204:02.52]Never mind.
[204:09.24]I feel like this map gives us the high ground and we've all like, we ran down the hill, you know?
[204:14.42]Yeah.
[204:15.54]Yes, we did.
[204:17.66]Mission complete.
[204:19.19]Oh, boy.
[204:24.55]Oh, my God.
[204:26.19]Oh, my.
[204:28.09]Dude, what the fuck?
[204:29.23]There's too many.
[204:30.73]Oh, my God.
[204:31.45]The biggest bomb ever run.
[204:33.13]Oh.
[204:36.31]Oh my god, I probably killed like a hundred right there.
[204:39.04]Oh.
[204:39.40]My.
[204:39.90]God.
[204:41.28]Oh shit, I got you, I got you.
[204:43.76]No, I did the wrong- I don't want to do a Hadouken, I want to do a fucking... Seiken Senouken!
[204:48.08]I don't want to do that!
[204:48.88]I hope I threw the thing before I died.
[204:53.22]I was killed by a meat saw.
[204:54.77]I got one out.
[204:55.21]When you die, just land on the top.
[204:58.83]Should've been up the fucking hill there.
[205:00.97]I'm just hiding until you guys are back, okay?
[205:03.57]I'm trying to get up the hill, the mountain.
[205:06.43]We got a resupply.
[205:07.72]Oh, no, we can leave.
[205:08.44]I mean, on the top of the hill.
[205:09.96]I'm trying.
[205:10.50]Yeah, I'm working my way back up there.
[205:15.06]I shouldn't have done this.
[205:21.57]We know the one that hurt.
[205:23.23]Oh, did you get it?
[205:23.67]Good.
[205:26.73]Extractions here.
[205:37.39]I like this mode.
[205:38.25]This is a nice one.
[205:45.11]I can get up there, though.
[205:50.79]Yeah, it feels like there are ten times more robots than there are bugs.
[205:54.55]Get in, poke, get in, get in.
[205:55.66]And then also they take ten times more shots to kill each.
[205:58.98]Yeah.
[206:01.18]Wait, what the heck?
[206:02.50]Get in, Germa.
[206:06.15]Wait, did I knock it in?
[206:08.09]No.
[206:08.71]What?
[206:09.74]I was trying to throw one more thing.
[206:10.58]You were so close.
[206:12.04]Oh, shit.
[206:12.58]I didn't realize we... I just... What if you threw a bomb on the plane?
[206:17.58]I threw one out there just to... I don't know.
[206:19.02]I thought we had like 10 to 20 seconds left.
[206:21.39]In game.
[206:22.91]Yeah, 20 seconds ago.
[206:27.41]Oh, shit.
[206:28.37]I wasn't paying attention.
[206:30.19]I was scared of all the monsters.
[206:42.47]Five stars.
[206:43.53]That doesn't feel like a five star.
[206:48.23]We actually did not die that much considering how crazy that was.
[206:51.89]I didn't set my mind.
[206:53.40]The second objective always rewards more of the requisition points than the first objective.
[207:00.64]And we almost have never done the second one.
[207:03.70]Do we even know what the second one was?
[207:05.93]I don't know.
[207:06.33]That was hell.
[207:12.41]It's so, I'm so glad that Vinny isn't even hungry.
[207:16.41]I'm hungry now.
[207:17.03]Dude, I killed eight people.
[207:24.21]To be fair though, I did, I was like dead from a lot of that.
[207:30.38]Poke got ten times your kills, it's crazy.
[207:32.68]No, I'm telling you, I had one airstrike.
[207:38.40]That killed at least 50.
[207:39.28]Yeah, Poke.
[207:40.92]You killed at least 30 to 40 things in the end there.
[207:43.58]It made me feel really good.
[207:44.82]A lot of dopamine with that one.
[207:51.25]Yeah, it got me.
[207:51.87]Alright.
[207:54.07]I don't like the sniper very much.
[207:56.29]Yeah, it's not good for the robots.
[207:57.65]I feel like I was just unloading a whole clip into them and I just wouldn't kill them.
[208:07.61]Alright lads, I gotta get going.
[208:09.15]I'm really happy to have played gaming with you all.
[208:13.89]I enjoyed it.
[208:14.91]That was good gaming.
[208:15.81]I had a great time.
[208:17.22]It was fun.
[208:18.68]Yeah, it was actually fun.
[208:19.76]And I'd be down for more of this at some point in the future.
[208:22.60]Do you guys actually want to do like VR games or something?
[208:27.16]We should do like a multiplayer night.
[208:29.06]A million percent.
[208:30.07]I want to play like a lot of stuff.
[208:32.39]Just like kind of an appetizer board of just a bunch of fun multiplayer just nonsense.
[208:37.65]Yeah, let's make a list of VR games to go through co-op, and if it's trash, go next.
[208:43.07]If it doesn't work, go next.
[208:44.19]A bunch of games.
[208:45.77]I have a couple, and I know my chat can suggest some more, too.
[208:50.49]So, yeah, I'll be down for that.
[208:52.65]Okay, let's make a date, then.
[208:57.54]That's hard for me because every week is weird for me.
[209:01.70]Let's make a new group chat.
[209:02.94]The VR group chat.
[209:05.11]Then we can decide how it goes.
[209:07.03]We'll invite you to that one.
[209:09.31]We've been talking about it, but we'll invite you.
[209:12.13]You're already in it.
[209:13.67]We will do the group.
[209:15.33]I'll be in touch with you guys.
[209:16.65]Thank you and have a good one.
[209:18.37]Feel free to keep playing, but enjoy.
[209:20.39]Bye.
[209:20.87]Yep, save the liberty.
[209:21.67]Goodbye.
[209:22.01]Thanks for playing.
[209:24.25]I want to keep gaming.
[209:25.77]If anyone wants to keep gaming.
[209:27.49]I need to put some macaroni and cheese in there.
[209:32.13]I'll do a couple more.
[209:33.33]I'll do at least two or three more.
[209:35.37]I'll keep playing.
[209:38.67]I feel like I'm just barely getting the hang of how the game works and I'll play another few rounds.
[209:45.05]I want to get this recoilless rifle.
[209:47.05]You could be my reload guy.
[209:48.93]I genuinely think the game is like really good I think it's really nice it's just the progression is throwing me off hard like I want I want more guns the price of the game plus the progression kind of sucks and then it really is only like two enemy types but everything that's in the game is really well made honestly yeah I don't even mind the enemy type thing though usually I do care about that but
[210:20.56]It's fun just to kind of shoot at monsters.
[210:23.74]Yeah.
[210:25.44]EDF is coming out in a few months, right?
[210:29.72]What's that?
[210:31.26]You never played EDF?
[210:33.46]No.
[210:34.10]Oh, man.
[210:35.20]You've got... Oh, where's Defense Force?
[210:38.16]Oh, man.
[210:38.44]Dude, the frogs look just like people.
[210:41.06]Never played it.
[210:41.54]That's one of the most fun games ever.
[210:47.08]So it's kind of like this, but it's like this on a more gigantic scale.
[210:55.25]Earth Defense Force six.
[210:56.39]I think it's already out in Japan, right?
[210:59.95]Yeah, they need to come out with the steam version for North America.
[211:04.81]Yeah, I'm 100% going to play.
[211:07.67]Oh, is this game genre trying to copy that genre?
[211:11.50]know what I mean this is like a big game not re like edf is really not that popular but it's really good it's like a niche thing okay yeah yeah it's I the progression in edf is edf is wacky what are they like 500 weapons in the game you can like call in a gundam in edf like it's just this but bigger
[211:41.51]Um, I think this mission is like bosses.
[211:43.99]There's like two big bosses.
[211:47.26]A Hulk.
[211:48.92]So I got the recoilless rifle.
[211:50.50]Jerma, I need you.
[211:53.08]What are you?
[211:53.64]Oh, you need me to hold it for you.
[211:55.62]You're the reloader.
[211:57.02]Okay.
[211:57.52]We could set up.
[212:00.25]You guys like the 40k games?
[212:03.61]I love the old Dawn of War games.
[212:06.61]Never played them.
[212:10.48]Dawn of War 2 and Dawn of War 3, I did not care for at all.
[212:13.84]Like 0.0.
[212:15.16]But Dawn of War, just the RTS, the kind of old school RTS one.
[212:19.68]I love that game.
[212:27.13]Dawn of War.
[212:29.19]Dawn of War.
[212:30.19]Never played them.
[212:33.99]They were very fun.
[212:39.08]But I mean, Dark Crusade Dark was so good.
[212:49.84]No people.
[212:51.64]People don't really.
[212:52.50]I feel like that could be kind of fun to do like a two V2 or like a free for all like dawn of war versus like you know, get a bunch of people to do it or like a few people to do it.
[213:04.43]I think that'd be fun.
[213:05.71]The old Red Alert games as well.
[213:09.71]Oh, what the fuck?
[213:10.65]Oh, geez.
[213:11.13]Oh, no.
[213:12.98]What just happened to me?
[213:14.60]We spawned in next to some real shit.
[213:20.60]I didn't like Dawn of War 2.
[213:22.26]It was way too condensed.
[213:23.66]I'm not a big fan of like that.
[213:25.30]Hey, you have this one squad and you don't really have a base.
[213:28.17]They just dropped them on you.
[213:30.45]I threw an orbital over there.
[213:31.47]Oh, God.
[213:32.41]Oh, God.
[213:38.72]I'm also throwing an orbital over you.
[213:42.11]I don't know what just happened to you.
[213:43.79]It's on me.
[213:45.51]That's going to get me killed, isn't it?
[213:54.83]Is that a Hulk down there or what is it?
[214:01.26]What is the SOS beacon?
[214:03.64]Requesting advanced weaponry.
[214:09.91]Oh, they're behind us now.
[214:16.34]Max empty.
[214:21.28]I need help.
[214:22.12]I'm pinned down.
[214:23.32]I'm pinned down.
[214:23.78]He doesn't have an arm anymore.
[214:24.86]I shot his arm off.
[214:26.18]I was thinking those shield enemies look like Warhammer enemies.
[214:28.98]Oh, behind us.
[214:30.22]I'm out.
[214:33.04]Oh, you can change.
[214:44.80]recoil this rifle it's right here you want to play with it we I need a second down a support weapon we need to uh take down that base down there they're coming from over on the other side now too we can destroy that factory we got to move in if we have an orbital orbital in 10 seconds
[215:16.59]It's not going to make it.
[215:20.01]Might count.
[215:23.29]Here, I got it.
[215:25.17]My cheater pre-order lets me throw further.
[215:27.35]Wait, really?
[215:28.76]Wait, what?
[215:29.12]Yeah.
[215:29.88]That's what armor's passive is.
[215:32.12]Okay, where's the recoilless?
[215:38.20]Back here.
[215:43.45]All right.
[215:47.86]So you want me to pick up the ammo?
[215:50.30]The backpack?
[215:53.19]I don't know.
[216:00.43]Yeah, you get the backpack.
[216:03.31]Okay.
[216:05.09]Holy shit, that almost went into me.
[216:06.47]Alright, so now I... Reloading you!
[216:10.38]Oh, sick.
[216:11.74]Okay.
[216:12.88]Okay.
[216:13.30]Well, let's... We gotta go...
[216:16.90]All right, when do you want to shoot it?
[216:18.46]Wait, are we attached?
[216:19.44]You're doing slash follow?
[216:20.53]I am doing slash follow.
[216:23.21]We can't go that fast, though.
[216:25.43]Yeah, we got to walk up this way to the Hulk.
[216:27.81]Here, here, here, here, here.
[216:30.57]No!
[216:30.83]I'm holding it.
[216:31.45]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[216:32.13]I think I'm doing it.
[216:40.01]Yeah, you did it.
[216:45.17]we took down the uh we got the hulk the drop ship or at least I tried the hulk is that way let's go get the hulk how many reloads do you have for it
[217:08.09]Uh, I have, I think quite a few.
[217:10.91]Doesn't look like it's that depleted.
[217:13.04]Wait, maybe it is.
[217:15.74]I don't know where I'm looking for it.
[217:20.22]I feel like that might be like a bot because we're three people.
[217:29.65]Yeah, I have two, I guess.
[217:37.78]Oh, let's random people join.
[217:40.16]Okay, let's find this Hulk.
[217:51.53]Eight kills last game.
[217:52.54]Did not extract.
[217:53.66]Ban every one of those words in the chat.
[217:56.74]I think I see it over there.
[217:58.28]Here, I'm going to rocket it.
[218:05.48]Got him.
[218:06.12]He's dead.
[218:07.00]I don't think that was Hulk.
[218:07.96]That's Hulk.
[218:09.26]Right next to him.
[218:10.30]You guys cannot be in the water.
[218:12.10]Here, reload me.
[218:14.00]I'm coming.
[218:20.42]Oh, shit.
[218:23.87]He's shooting through the wall.
[218:26.43]Cluster bombing.
[218:30.53]Cluster bombing.
[218:31.77]It's on him.
[218:34.95]And an orbital.
[218:38.41]Orbital right on his ass.
[218:40.15]I died.
[218:42.14]Orbital.
[218:44.96]I think I should... I'm going to gas.
[218:47.58]Oh, is he right around the corner?
[218:48.36]I don't think I ever saw it.
[218:52.70]Really?
[218:53.00]It's a big guy right here.
[218:54.64]Yeah, I never got to actually see him.
[218:58.20]Good work.
[218:59.18]Sorry, we took care of it.
[219:11.27]Oh, this rocket launch is really strong, though.
[219:21.26]He just needs good teamwork.
[219:23.42]Wish it was cars.
[219:27.30]They'll probably add it eventually, I would imagine.
[219:30.70]Yeah, like a buggy or something.
[219:44.06]Like shift tab is the worst key behind steam could have chose I turned off that overlay a long time ago.
[219:52.34]It just yeah, I keep I always kept pressing it Who is it
[220:11.85]I got gas going over there.
[220:14.15]They threw a grenade.
[220:15.49]They did.
[220:15.87]You know what?
[220:17.45]I'm just dropping it here from Rochester.
[220:21.11]Oh fucker.
[220:27.03]Watch out for the gas.
[220:32.67]That was a missile launcher over there.
[220:33.95]Requesting advanced weaponry.
[220:41.28]Yeah,
[220:45.72]My God.
[220:52.30]Alright, this other Hulk is over there.
[220:55.15]That way.
[221:05.75]Gas doesn't work on the robots.
[221:07.82]Didn't it say it was for mechanical enemies?
[221:11.22]The description says it does.
[221:21.97]Would you trust the in-game description or one guy in chat?
[221:25.73]Hmm.
[221:28.71]I don't like the stamina.
[221:33.65]Running long distances and having a stamina bar.
[221:40.30]Yeah, it feels like a way just to kind of slow you down.
[221:43.20]Yeah.
[221:44.02]I like the pause.
[221:45.52]Really?
[221:47.36]I've never liked the pause.
[221:48.30]The calm between battles.
[221:50.19]Oh, no, no, I mean like the, you know, like the mechanic of stamina regen.
[221:55.19]I just hate it.
[221:57.39]Or stuff like this.
[221:59.63]I agree there that like MMO style would be nice if it was like in combat only stamina or if you've shot or been shot recently.
[222:06.31]Yeah.
[222:09.21]We got some bots coming.
[222:13.97]That's just me, though.
[222:16.49]Back up about two feet.
[222:25.03]I want a big orbital.
[222:26.85]I mean, a cluster.
[222:29.43]Hmm.
[222:41.56]Yeah, out of combat, you should be able to run along.
[222:44.32]That's what that's what it is.
[222:45.32]There you go.
[222:45.78]Do you get this backpack?
[222:48.68]Wait.
[222:49.06]Oh, I called on the wrong one.
[222:50.74]Oh.
[222:53.50]OK, I'm calling the other one.
[222:56.76]Anybody else?
[223:00.51]Holy shit, I threw that far.
[223:01.61]Recoil this rifle.
[223:03.81]Yeah.
[223:07.43]Whoa.
[223:15.20]I quit.
[223:15.80]Oh my goodness.
[223:23.45]Okay.
[223:26.27]Yeah, I'm playing with the diaper guy.
[223:31.32]Oh, yeah.
[223:31.76]Diaper guy.
[223:32.56]I've heard him.
[223:33.36]He streams on Twitch, right?
[223:35.12]Yeah.
[223:35.74]Reload me.
[223:39.58]Diaper KTV.
[223:45.89]Loaded.
[223:48.85]I better get assist kills for this.
[223:56.45]I should save it for the Hulk.
[223:57.33]Requesting orbital strike.
[224:07.91]We're going to we're going to blow this thing up, right?
[224:09.29]All right, I got it.
[224:15.95]You could change camera direction or view with Malcolm.
[224:22.57]Requesting advanced weaponry.
[224:28.29]Oh my God, there's mines down here.
[224:30.40]I cannot believe I survived.
[224:36.30]And I can't just like I'm out.
[224:39.34]No.
[224:39.84]Okay.
[224:42.11]Oh, this thing's still active.
[224:45.85]Nice job.
[224:57.28]dude xp acquired yeah it's all like we just weren't doing a lot of objectives like if you look at our map there's this huge red zone to the north of us yeah would be like a big base we need to destroy and you get all the points all the points all right should we do it we have 14 resurrects yeah I think we can wait a sec all my stuff's on cooldown requesting supplies okay
[225:30.07]Yo, we're about to get some mad points.
[225:34.31]This is scared the shit out of me.
[225:48.89]Dude, the heavy armor is so good.
[226:03.41]I'm going for the big throw.
[226:09.80]No, I'm bad.
[226:10.96]I thought I saw it go over.
[226:15.90]I'll try.
[226:16.24]Eat shit cooling in an orbital strike.
[226:34.53]Alright, should we try to get in?
[226:36.77]Yep.
[226:40.51]Oh, that is something.
[226:43.92]That's something.
[226:47.56]Can you reload me?
[226:49.64]I will in just a sec.
[226:50.44]I'm throwing gas right here.
[226:51.88]I'm clustering him.
[226:52.72]Walk back a little bit.
[226:54.24]Holy shit!
[226:59.84]It's just a straight line from where we aim it, so... I don't think I have very many... I don't think I have enough bullets to reload you.
[227:06.40]Where are you?
[227:07.02]Oh, you're in here.
[227:08.62]Actually, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do.
[227:09.54]There's another huge one.
[227:10.90]I don't have any ammo.
[227:11.70]I need help.
[227:12.24]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[227:17.60]Uh, there's walls.
[227:18.48]I can't get over there.
[227:20.98]Holy crap!
[227:21.88]Let me get... Oh, we can get... Yeah, we can get up here.
[227:27.16]Oh, res.
[227:30.79]Actually, probably good for us not to go in there, honestly.
[227:33.23]Yeah, there's like three of them.
[227:38.18]Oh shit.
[227:38.76]Oh, something behind us.
[227:53.21]Oh, it's behind us.
[227:54.33]It's out here with us.
[227:58.95]Oh, fuck.
[227:59.93]Oh, fuck.
[228:00.72]Oh, I'm dead.
[228:01.62]I'm dead.
[228:01.86]I'm dead.
[228:02.12]I'm dead.
[228:04.66]I got you.
[228:05.70]Oh, I got you.
[228:09.26]We need to get to a better spot.
[228:10.18]We're actually getting... Yeah, this is bad here.
[228:11.63]Screwed right here.
[228:12.47]Yeah, I have a shotgun now.
[228:16.47]All my stuff's on cooldown.
[228:18.11]I'm going to rez here.
[228:18.79]I'm rezzing.
[228:19.09]I'm rezzing.
[228:19.97]Okay.
[228:20.28]Oh, no.
[228:20.64]There's one right on us.
[228:23.56]Just run down, run down, run down.
[228:24.54]Did he walk around or was he just coming from the other way?
[228:26.94]Oh my.
[228:27.38]I don't know.
[228:29.02]This is a dead end dude.
[228:32.08]Just prone.
[228:32.56]Remember, he's prone.
[228:33.42]Oh, they have like explosives on their backs.
[228:37.68]Alright, I did get an orbital out.
[228:39.32]Hopefully it hits it.
[228:39.90]I'm resing you.
[228:43.44]Okay, good.
[228:47.56]Yeah, behind these things, I'm going to try and get around.
[228:51.02]You need to hit the back.
[228:57.36]Just rotate all the way around.
[228:58.80]Rotating.
[228:59.58]They're just bumbling us.
[229:00.90]We're all doing it.
[229:01.92]Yeah.
[229:02.78]Oh my god.
[229:03.52]Wait, one of us should go the other way then.
[229:06.28]I'll go the other way.
[229:08.03]I'm just hiding behind this rock.
[229:11.67]Oh my god.
[229:12.99]God damn it.
[229:13.65]I was about to get up.
[229:15.27]Oh, you dropped it.
[229:16.03]Oh, I dropped it.
[229:16.59]That's actually perfect because it's gas.
[229:18.13]So he'll walk right into it.
[229:20.83]Did he get hit by it?
[229:25.09]I don't know.
[229:25.55]I'm running.
[229:26.05]Come on.
[229:30.36]We just got to kill the main guy.
[229:36.47]I just... I need to wait for my cooldowns.
[229:38.97]Like, I don't have anything to shoot them with.
[229:40.81]Yeah.
[229:43.83]Like, don't even shoot them right now.
[229:49.16]Okay.
[229:52.56]Well, at least we've far enough away.
[230:03.03]There's a resupply right here.
[230:04.21]We got a big rock over here too.
[230:05.73]We can hide here.
[230:08.13]Once I get a sniper or something.
[230:09.74]Oh, there you go.
[230:10.44]That was a big hit.
[230:14.26]Have what?
[230:17.08]Did he actually hit me from all the way over there?
[230:18.52]Seems kind of unfair.
[230:26.98]Here, get a little closer.
[230:28.06]This might kill him.
[230:34.25]Not quite.
[230:35.05]Oh, yep.
[230:35.67]There we go.
[230:36.95]Alright, this one's dead.
[230:43.46]Did I hit him?
[230:43.94]Yeah, I think we're okay to move.
[230:53.39]Holy shit, there's so many over there.
[230:54.83]Ooh.
[231:02.06]I got one over there too.
[231:03.26]Bot drop detected.
[231:05.32]I don't know what that is.
[231:07.22]I guess when they're going to come over.
[231:14.85]Oh boy.
[231:15.41]That's not good.
[231:18.13]I'm coming back to you, sir.
[231:19.15]This is bad news.
[231:20.85]I'm dead.
[231:22.35]I'm dead.
[231:26.59]They knocked me down into my own.
[231:27.93]Oh my God.
[231:28.55]Not good.
[231:47.81]I'm reinforcing.
[231:50.28]We only got seven left.
[231:51.64]Yeah, this is a big objective.
[231:53.78]This is a side mission.
[231:55.44]Yeah, this is just side.
[231:56.32]But I think we got it, though.
[231:57.38]There's only one left.
[231:59.33]There's a couple on you, folks.
[232:03.97]Behind you guys, behind you guys, a bunch behind a bunch.
[232:07.30]Oh, my Lord.
[232:08.72]Oh, that's a lot.
[232:20.69]I got nothing.
[232:28.63]I think if we don't, I think if we just don't rush the boss, it might just keep responding, right?
[232:35.64]I don't know her.
[232:36.16]No, no, no.
[232:45.32]I don't know.
[232:51.53]Five res is left.
[232:53.67]Oh, my God.
[232:54.99]Dude, that guy killed me fucking instantly.
[232:57.59]The enforcing.
[233:01.89]Calling down a support weapon.
[233:21.07]I have an orbital throwing over there.
[233:25.63]Let's just run straight.
[233:26.83]I'm running this way.
[233:27.47]I'm running this way.
[233:31.36]I'm set to run it.
[233:32.60]Push reload.
[233:33.68]I'm coming with you.
[233:35.44]I've got the recoilless backpack here.
[233:39.36]Actually, I'll come with you.
[233:41.48]I feel like we need the power.
[233:43.22]We need the firepower.
[233:43.84]I'm just going to rush that boss.
[233:53.55]Where's the, uh, where is it?
[233:55.59]It's on the ground.
[233:56.05]There's like three saw guys coming.
[233:57.37]I got it.
[234:00.83]Okay, you want to load?
[234:13.67]Uh, let's walk up this way where Poke is first.
[234:17.49]Because there should be one more gigamech.
[234:19.59]I think it's there.
[234:20.11]Yeah, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[234:21.59]Reload me.
[234:23.07]Where's the boss at?
[234:25.53]Oh, nice shot.
[234:26.59]One more.
[234:26.93]Reloading you.
[234:31.19]I think that's going to be it.
[234:35.23]You're in the leg.
[234:39.37]It has no arms.
[234:40.05]Is it still alive?
[234:40.85]It's still alive with like one leg.
[234:43.65]I got nothing left.
[234:44.69]I got no ammo left.
[234:47.95]I can drop rockets though.
[234:49.39]Grab a rocket launcher.
[234:54.58]gee whiz oh geez oh geez rick all right oak is up there popa coming to you oh god yeah there's another big one still there I'm gonna you're fully surrounded man okay okay there's another drop ship
[235:20.23]Oh, what the fuck?
[235:21.31]Really?
[235:22.83]They do not want us to be over here.
[235:28.43]What do you say we leave?
[235:33.25]We've come this far.
[235:34.31]Are we going to abandon it right now?
[235:38.45]No, no, no, no.
[235:47.54]I'm back with you guys now.
[235:52.28]I was going to like bite him.
[235:55.44]There's still like in the distance.
[235:57.27]I see another one of those big ones.
[236:01.17]I have no special weapons or anything.
[236:05.25]I've got a couple of orbitals.
[236:07.35]I'm just going to throw them in.
[236:10.17]Where is everything?
[236:12.83]I'm going to orbital death.
[236:13.97]Oh my God, there he is.
[236:14.77]Okay, orbital.
[236:19.24]Hopefully it hurts him.
[236:23.84]He got him.
[236:38.30]How are we?
[236:40.32]Geez.
[236:40.48]Yeah, we need to destroy these factories, ma'am.
[236:56.90]Another big one's coming.
[236:58.38]That was happening.
[237:01.62]We did it!
[237:06.16]I got you, I got you.
[237:07.66]We need to leave now, though.
[237:09.65]There's still another big one.
[237:11.65]Did we actually complete that objective?
[237:13.87]Wow, there is another big one.
[237:15.87]Those are what hulks are.
[237:17.39]We've killed like ten of them and our mission was to kill two.
[237:20.57]I just dropped on one of them and killed one.
[237:22.41]Nice.
[237:22.87]Oh shit, you really did.
[237:23.85]That was awesome.
[237:24.41]You saw that?
[237:25.33]Yeah.
[237:26.65]Alright, we gotta go kill one hulk.
[237:28.21]I think we can handle it after seven.
[237:38.01]Where is it?
[237:43.07]Yeah, it's all the way down here.
[237:55.26]Oh, it's that way.
[237:56.02]Oh my God.
[237:58.56]They see you guys behind us.
[238:00.60]Oh no.
[238:00.90]We keep running.
[238:01.44]Don't shoot at them.
[238:02.58]Yeah.
[238:13.51]Come on, man.
[238:14.05]Oh no.
[238:14.97]I'm slipping.
[238:18.47]Want to do orbital?
[238:19.65]Yeah, I might as well just throw a few.
[238:24.13]Yeah, why not?
[238:25.33]Just taxpayer money.
[238:29.43]Is that a Hulk shooting all the way over there?
[238:32.57]What is that?
[238:32.97]What is firing into the sky?
[238:34.17]They died.
[238:34.55]I think there's just background stuff.
[238:37.81]We got to turn left and it should be in that base.
[238:48.68]Yep.
[238:51.14]Make sure you guys got all your shit.
[238:57.46]uh anybody wants a rocket launcher I'm gonna put one right here I suggest taking one because they're very effective we should do like three orbitals on them get ready get your orbitals ready let's just orbital the balls yeah where's he at
[239:29.74]Got my orbital ready.
[239:30.64]Right here, right here.
[239:33.36]Yeah, he's coming.
[239:34.34]Yeah, alright.
[239:34.88]On mine right there.
[239:37.44]Let's smoke this motherfucker.
[239:43.69]There you go.
[239:44.67]There you go, dude.
[239:48.41]That was worth some money.
[239:52.35]So wait, why was the other place so hard?
[239:54.48]Because there was like seven of them.
[239:56.02]That was ridiculous.
[239:59.54]God damn.
[240:00.90]Can you shoot at their legs?
[240:01.78]I feel like I'm not doing any damage with this gun.
[240:04.86]The mech.
[240:09.65]Back the way we came.
[240:11.11]Extraction.
[240:13.23]Unless there's anything else in here we can pick up.
[240:16.77]What is all the way over there, isn't it?
[240:31.60]I did.
[240:31.90]All right.
[240:32.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[240:39.11]You were supposed to jump through.
[240:41.43]I press the wrong button.
[240:42.29]I press the wrong button.
[240:43.05]I'll be honest.
[240:43.57]You just hurt your knees.
[240:46.14]You're just like, God damn.
[241:03.54]We're almost there.
[241:04.18]Remember, we're going to have to defend it.
[241:05.61]Mm-hmm.
[241:06.03]I feel like we could just kind of hide behind a rock.
[241:11.99]And we only have two respawns.
[241:13.99]Rare sample acquired.
[241:15.65]Yeah, let's play the absolute coward play and pick a spot and just sit in the same spot.
[241:21.35]Let them all group up and then just bomb it.
[241:22.95]Mm-hmm.
[241:24.91]Calling in extraction.
[241:26.91]Go up here, actually, like right here.
[241:28.73]This one's far too complicated for me.
[241:31.39]Do you want to do recoilless?
[241:34.02]I would love to.
[241:39.30]I think you didn't grab the backpack.
[241:41.56]No, you didn't.
[241:43.77]I had an old one that was depleted.
[241:47.73]Oh, I would have assumed that was your special slot.
[241:50.51]That's a lot better knowing that you can carry your own stuff.
[241:53.58]How is that wrong?
[242:03.05]There's already like a whole horde.
[242:04.37]I need a machine gun.
[242:14.84]Holy shit, they are right here.
[242:16.72]I'm doing a cluster bomb.
[242:19.92]Oh no, wrong button, wrong button, wrong button.
[242:33.81]Big scary guy coming in.
[242:36.13]Requesting orbital strike.
[242:40.60]Need reloads if you want to come do it.
[242:46.92]Clustering.
[242:47.44]Alright, let's do it.
[242:53.14]Go wait for that cluster to land.
[242:57.16]You're kind of in a weird spot.
[242:59.16]Yeah, I know.
[243:08.43]What?
[243:08.85]It went through his armpit.
[243:12.89]What?
[243:13.93]Okay.
[243:14.39]Abort.
[243:14.63]This rocket launcher is going to be behind you.
[243:22.24]I suggest picking it up.
[243:24.14]Be careful.
[243:24.56]It's about to drop.
[243:46.81]They also have rocket launchers.
[243:52.24]I don't have any ammo in this gun, no!
[243:57.08]There's guns everywhere.
[243:59.32]Alright, here we go.
[244:11.07]That's just hanging out back here.
[244:20.54]Fuck no!
[244:21.60]Are you kidding me?
[244:23.24]I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing, I'm rezzing.
[244:24.13]Oh wait.
[244:27.21]I even dove and it hit me.
[244:30.55]Dude, they coming for you.
[244:31.85]Oh shit, I can't.
[244:34.23]Three seconds.
[244:34.71]Two.
[244:36.37]One.
[244:37.09]I'm knocking.
[244:40.87]I made it, right?
[244:42.33]I don't know.
[244:43.26]I think so.
[244:44.26]What the?
[244:45.14]That's so unfair.
[244:45.78]I don't think I made it.
[244:46.74]Unfair.
[244:54.69]Do I get less rewards?
[245:00.42]Oh, I made it.
[245:03.30]I know I didn't get extracted again, but that was it was not my fault.
[245:07.86]I promise.
[245:08.36]He promises.
[245:10.80]Yeah, you get 100 R's for extracting.
[245:23.31]Apparently a bonus for time remaining.
[245:33.60]So we got five credits.
[245:34.58]That's it.
[245:37.55]Damn.
[245:37.83]I'm peeing.
[245:41.71]I will do one more.
[245:43.15]I think one more sounds good for me.
[246:05.14]Combo meal always standing off to the side.
[246:07.12]I know.
[246:10.63]Yeah.
[246:12.61]Dude, he's a murderer.
[246:14.45]Poke shooting 2,000 shots.
[246:25.06]Yeah.
[246:27.52]Oh, we unlocked hard.
[246:28.78]Yeah.
[246:33.37]Oh shit, we're going to play some fucking hard.
[246:37.79]You have your funeral.
[246:41.53]I mean, that's probably fine if it's not the robots.
[246:46.85]Yo.
[246:52.91]You got hard mode.
[246:57.99]Eagle air strike.
[247:00.20]What about napalm?
[247:02.91]That would be kind of fun.
[247:10.08]That would be kind of fun.
[247:13.06]I'll try it.
[247:13.42]I think it's area denial, I guess.
[247:31.72]Let's make this one a good one.
[247:34.44]Initiating FTL jump to the Angel's Venture System.
[247:50.45]Napalm is good for bugs.
[247:54.19]I'll give it a go.
[247:54.67]Mission coordinates locked.
[247:59.80]yeah I'm poor dude they're trying to keep us poor so we have to keep saving the universe what is this like microchip what is this thing oh it's okay it's super credits all right I get it oh laser cannon
[248:31.50]Where do you even use the super credit?
[248:33.84]In the super store.
[248:35.44]Oh, the super store.
[248:36.90]I got a cool new helmet.
[248:53.44]Stratagem call-in time increased by 100%.
[248:57.92]This is harder, I guess.
[249:03.29]It's going to take 100% longer to deploy any stratagems, by the way.
[249:09.09]Wait, what is ship module?
[249:12.23]Wait a second.
[249:14.73]I don't know, but it costs them a lot.
[249:22.94]How's the game?
[249:23.38]I think we're all in agreement that the game's fun.
[249:27.82]I like the shooting.
[249:28.48]I like the dodging.
[249:29.46]I like the running.
[249:30.40]I like the camaraderie.
[249:35.26]I really want the flamethrower.
[249:37.34]But I don't think I'm going to see it.
[249:39.92]This is the last game I'm going to be playing today.
[249:47.41]I feel like this has got me all and this is my names all over it though.
[249:50.77]Don't have to aim very much on the side of the box.
[249:54.63]Not a whole lot of aiming.
[249:56.96]You know, you just kind of aim in a direction and you'll get something.
[250:04.04]You look for damn cool doing it too.
[250:12.73]Hold on.
[250:14.03]Yep.
[250:16.26]Let's try and get as much done here as we can.
[250:17.86]This is a destroy the eggs main objective.
[250:23.18]I see through it.
[250:23.74]Even it shows you the red zones before you drop.
[250:26.32]I didn't realize that.
[250:28.63]So where do you want to go?
[250:30.31]Let's drop.
[250:31.57]I get this bug sometimes where I have to like re-enter the pod before I can choose where I drop.
[250:48.85]Let's drop in the bottom and then go up the right side where all the hives were and do as much as we can.
[250:53.51]Cool.
[251:10.05]So this is on hard?
[251:12.87]Yeah.
[251:13.63]Okay.
[251:14.73]So wait, challenging is easier than hard?
[251:19.23]yeah apparently I'm about to challenging you I wonder if you guys ever played the first game we did play the first game I did it was that like 2013 or something stir I don't know but the video on my channel
[251:46.62]I we didn't get super far into it because we only had the two of us but it I liked what I saw but we kind of just never it was top down
[252:17.26]Oh, it's a fog level too.
[252:18.46]Oh, I love a bit of fog.
[252:23.08]Come on.
[252:23.74]Oh my god, it takes so long now to get these fucking things out.
[252:26.94]I just shot.
[252:28.64]I was just another enemy.
[252:34.11]Oh my god.
[252:34.49]I can't see.
[252:44.35]yeah I didn't think we landed this close to death hmm I'm dead oh I'm dead guys maybe this is hard
[253:14.61]Oh, what the hell?
[253:15.46]I got like a weird blur effect.
[253:18.08]Combo, you landed on me.
[253:20.60]Oh!
[253:21.24]Reinforcing!
[253:23.20]I just screamed that.
[253:24.94]Oh my god.
[253:25.44]Well, I got it out.
[253:27.57]I can't run.
[253:28.07]I'm hurting my leg!
[253:50.13]Oh God.
[253:54.93]Wait, I'm before you died.
[253:56.25]Oh, here we go.
[253:57.55]Wait, did I?
[253:58.01]I don't know.
[253:59.26]I think it looked like you were trying to throw one man.
[254:02.28]Unless it just auto let us come back.
[254:06.14]That'd be crazy.
[254:12.18]Yeah.
[254:13.82]My whole screen is fucking green man.
[254:15.62]I can't even play the game.
[254:21.89]There's a tree making the fog.
[254:24.52]This is brutal.
[254:26.22]Apparently the tree making the fog.
[254:28.30]Yeah, it's just where we landed.
[254:30.68]You got a orbital that big tree.
[254:32.26]I'm doing it right now.
[254:40.43]You have got it.
[254:41.13]I just threw one up.
[254:45.22]I went through the floor.
[254:56.39]Oh nice job stir getting those bug holes.
[255:06.18]Dude.
[255:07.58]I was really confused what was going on there.
[255:10.68]Like I threw a grenade in the hole and it blew up and it hurt me and then it never blew up the hole.
[255:17.31]OK, this is where it all we all pulled together here.
[255:20.43]Yeah, we got this.
[255:22.77]We can actually kind of see a little.
[255:33.87]where's punk a lol right up here he's uh he's got high ground I burped sorry won't do it again there's still holes like all around us
[256:09.16]Presupply sweet.
[256:10.92]Actually, no, you know what I'm going to do?
[256:15.80]I want to see what this looks like.
[256:18.46]I guess I'm going to throw it over here.
[256:22.28]Oh my Lord, that's a big guy.
[256:24.40]He's right here.
[256:26.78]That's not even going to hit me.
[256:30.57]Take my right.
[256:34.43]Oh, this might have been the worst.
[256:37.74]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[256:39.54]Everything's just green.
[256:44.70]My fucking face is green.
[256:47.78]I feel like this has just been nonstop chaos.
[257:02.47]I think we need to run away from here and just go towards the eggs.
[257:07.21]Because the exit isn't close at all.
[257:08.95]I just died to a little guy.
[257:13.83]Oh, no.
[257:22.10]Excuse me.
[257:27.18]Mr. Baker.
[257:29.82]OK.
[257:35.08]Oh, my Lord.
[257:37.51]just get off of me um yeah let's just try and back up yeah it was only that one hole that my grenade bounced out of and killed me
[258:07.84]I yeah, you know what I mean?
[258:09.30]True, yeah.
[258:14.34]I'm going West.
[258:16.18]There's an objective here.
[258:17.80]Oh, he's beaming.
[258:27.57]That's pretty sick.
[258:35.92]Would you get that thing?
[258:38.01]I bought it laser cannon.
[258:41.95]Awesome.
[258:45.95]You grab the backpack.
[258:47.43]Calling down support weapon.
[258:49.12]Watch out next to you though.
[258:50.60]I have stuff coming in.
[258:54.36]Got backpack.
[258:56.50]Okay.
[259:01.13]Bag's empty!
[259:02.31]New mag!
[259:10.73]Give me another one.
[259:18.22]Noticing the hard mode.
[259:19.64]Oh, true.
[259:30.32]Big guy.
[259:35.87]No, no, leave me alone.
[259:42.88]I can't get away from these guys.
[259:45.47]Yo, where's my orbital, bro?
[259:48.01]They do take so long.
[259:50.85]Calling in orbital strike.
[259:52.19]I need to reload this fucking gun.
[260:06.48]Nice.
[260:06.84]Nice.
[260:08.16]Yeah, they take so long.
[260:09.51]We need to save them for holes or
[260:13.95]I don't even think we can put them on big guys.
[260:21.68]I don't think we're making it out of this mission with four respawns.
[260:25.00]Yeah.
[260:25.88]And we've done like an objective.
[260:30.50]We just run some eggs right now.
[260:33.36]Can we extract right now?
[260:34.48]Is that possible?
[260:35.80]No, we have to do the main objective as soon as possible.
[260:47.21]Wow.
[260:51.89]God, please.
[260:53.90]Requesting advanced weaponry.
[260:55.32]Can you reload me?

[260:58.38]Sure can.
[260:59.98]Just the one's fine.
[261:02.20]Save it for when we see a big boy.

[263:25.25]Whoa.
[263:28.17]Where the fuck did he come?
[263:29.19]He came over here that quickly.
[263:33.22]There's a lot of mines in here.
[263:34.24]Watch out.
[263:35.52]I'm going to do a bomb behind us.
[263:36.66]Run towards me or you die.
[263:48.67]You alright, sir?
[263:55.21]No.
[263:56.01]No, big guy's on me.
[263:56.98]Boy, there's a big guy here too.
[263:58.14]Yeah, I think I jumped at the wrong time.
[264:02.84]I think that's going to be a GG.
[264:05.86]I'm coming.
[264:15.60]I landed on him.
[264:16.22]Did I kill him?
[264:18.35]Alright, I got him.
[264:21.30]What dude?
[264:22.10]These little bugs man.
[264:24.74]Reinforce it.
[264:27.98]I got you.
[264:32.92]Almost out of ammo again.
[264:34.10]Oh my God of mine.
[264:43.95]I wasn't even looking.
[264:45.17]I was trying to... Dude, I had my fight stick trying to do a fucking hadouken again.
[264:49.85]I think... I think it's over.
[264:57.61]I'll run to it.
[265:03.56]Calling down a support weapon.
[265:18.34]All right.
[265:20.02]Nice.
[265:20.40]Let's go.
[265:23.52]No more reinforcements except for the two minute timer.
[265:28.22]He's running straight to it.
[265:30.18]Straight to what?
[265:31.46]The eggs.
[265:31.86]It's to our right.
[265:34.02]You're running away from it.
[265:35.00]It's in here.
[265:35.42]You're right.
[265:36.52]I'm going to orbital it.
[265:37.70]Don't waste yours.
[265:38.74]Oops.
[265:38.92]I already did it.
[265:41.16]Cool.
[265:42.04]Okay.
[265:42.78]There's a huge guy that just ran out of nowhere from the fucking fog.
[266:15.38]Feel like I goofed taking things like the The recoilless rifle I just need like something that can actually reliably kill these big bugs Come on stop proning
[266:42.09]I can't play for 30 seconds.
[266:43.23]I'm pressing space.
[266:49.56]How come I can't... I don't understand what's going on.
[266:53.28]Like, what?
[266:58.48]I like the part of the game where you turn into the Tetris block.
[267:08.03]the only thing that all these levels are missing is like lasers going through the fog there's the huge holes to your left if you have grenades yeah I don't have grenades so what do you have to do uh oh oh that's a lot oh boy
[267:39.61]Listen, I'm going to do an airstrike on you.
[267:40.87]Can you run?
[267:42.75]Towards me, towards me, towards me.
[267:43.77]I blew up one of the fucking holes.
[267:45.49]I can't move.
[267:46.61]Imagine calling in reinforcements and you get Jerma.
[267:50.85]Look where I landed.
[267:51.67]I couldn't even move.
[268:02.76]I came out of the hole and I was surrounded.
[268:05.92]I couldn't even move.
[268:06.56]I couldn't even run anywhere.
[268:07.52]You got to move your Tetris block.
[268:17.51]How high up on the difficulty is hard?
[268:21.65]Uh, probably five out of nine.
[268:23.40]Oh my God.
[268:24.70]I can't imagine doing this on like nine.
[268:26.66]I think a lot of our, um, our stratagems are kind of not helping.
[268:33.66]Like if we had turrets and stuff, it would make a huge difference.
[268:37.82]I think you missed.
[268:40.47]Don't know.
[268:41.51]No, you got it.
[268:47.21]Oh,
[268:48.89]I can't move.
[269:04.08]Oh, there's all.
[269:11.13]Oh, no.
[269:14.25]Uh, I just saw in the chat they said bear in mind you guys are running with three out of four.
[269:20.24]Yeah.
[269:22.30]I think that's our problem.
[269:24.52]Our problem.
[269:27.02]Does it not?
[269:27.48]Does it just not scale it?
[269:30.58]Maybe maybe it's just hard.
[269:33.35]Reinforcements.
[269:39.07]Request approved deploying reinforcements calling
[269:43.73]Got one.
[269:56.97]What happened?
[270:00.91]I'd love to watch what my friends are doing in the game.
[270:07.26]Folks running around doing everything.
[270:08.58]I don't know if I can even do this.
[270:11.62]And we cannot help him.
[270:28.64]I don't know.
[270:29.88]I'm dead.
[270:31.16]You did exceptionally well for being alone.
[270:33.62]Holy shit.
[270:34.38]I'm dead.
[270:35.48]I should have just died sooner.
[270:56.10]think you got us did you get his points for continuing to kill things probably I don't know let me a little bit probably for killing the one hive if your camera was bugged down you can't see anything though I should just die all about like stuck as a potato I don't actually know how to lower the difficulty every time we've unlocked one it just says auto done it
[271:23.14]All right, gamers.
[271:23.80]No.
[271:23.86]You don't even know what I was going to say?
[271:26.69]No.
[271:26.77]Well... Nope.
[271:27.13]Nope.
[271:51.28]I was going to say, well, you're saying no.
[271:52.88]I was going to say I was going to cook you a fucking minestrone soup from scratch and you're just saying no.
[271:58.59]So, okay.
[271:59.69]Well, it is my birthday.
[272:00.75]Are we ready for the next mission?
[272:01.83]That's what I was.
[272:02.51]I'm ready.
[272:03.51]I'm so ready for the next mission.
[272:04.71]I lowered the difficulty back down to challenging because there's three of us.
[272:08.73]Okay.
[272:10.15]I'll do one more good one.
[272:12.18]One more real one where we win.
[272:16.20]I was going to leave like one and a half missions ago.
[272:19.48]No.
[272:22.11]use the shotgun it's my birthday I told you I was gonna do one more orbit synchronized all right this is this is the one this is the one we're gonna dominate okay let's land down here because it's safe yeah every time I do that it doesn't let me click
[273:12.59]So we don't have like 100% time to do an orbital strike, right?
[273:19.28]I don't think so.
[273:22.95]I bought the tank.
[273:43.85]oh yeah they call me the egg destroyer actually let's go uh go that way
[274:14.90]Going that way.
[274:16.84]Let's handle the first egg sacks quickly.
[274:22.00]And is this a hole or is this a fire?
[274:27.10]Little bit more.
[274:28.40]There is monsters over here.
[274:39.69]I think I just stepped on stink butts.
[274:42.47]My bad.
[274:48.36]Still coming.
[274:51.14]Where I can I see?
[274:52.92]Last reload.
[275:06.28]Reload.
[275:12.10]Keep it moving.
[275:15.98]Oh boy.
[275:27.03]Which moon?
[275:32.81]Your butt.
[275:35.81]Correct answer.
[275:41.90]I'd say Europa.
[275:47.76]Correct answer is Titan.
[275:50.00]Is that a real planet?
[275:54.39]Moon, yeah.
[275:57.19]Is moon not a planet?
[275:59.25]No.
[276:00.35]Why?
[276:01.91]Because moons orbit planets.
[276:04.62]They're smaller.
[276:06.64]If you didn't know what a moon was.
[276:09.74]I dropped out of high school.
[276:11.54]Me too.
[276:13.86]How do you know that?
[276:16.67]Okay, we got some big eggs this way.
[276:21.73]How do you freaking know that?
[276:27.20]Throwing a turret up there.
[276:28.24]If it shoots you, blame Vinny.
[276:31.14]Actually, you know what?
[276:36.77]I guess I'll take something too.
[276:38.73]Getting gas coming up.
[276:53.16]It's gas.
[276:53.78]It's gas.
[276:54.38]Don't just back up.
[277:03.72]It's just gas gas.
[277:16.88]I almost just shot you right in the head, sir.
[277:18.80]Yeah, I saw that.
[277:25.76]You mad still alive?
[277:28.25]No.
[277:34.18]OK, we got we got a push up.
[277:36.40]I don't know if you know this, but these these bugs come out of these holes.
[277:48.62]There's one right here.
[277:49.72]I have no grenades.
[277:51.54]I got one.
[277:51.90]Cool.
[278:08.04]Couple more holes.
[278:10.12]I got it.
[278:14.38]What in the name?
[278:25.75]What?
[278:27.50]Gas going up.
[278:34.06]That was a big gas.
[278:35.60]That was a huge gas.
[278:37.88]Dude, they can still smell it.
[278:39.10]Why not just use raid?
[278:43.07]You think raid spray would kill these guys?
[278:49.31]Probably.
[278:49.87]Probably just stay in space and do that.
[278:52.43]Gotta get the nest.
[278:54.37]Alright, we're two.
[279:03.97]There's another nest right near us.
[279:05.93]What would you do if Otto turned into one of these bugs?
[279:09.76]I would still be his best friend.
[279:11.54]Has anyone got the resupply?
[279:18.06]I do not.
[279:22.16]20 seconds.
[279:24.19]I really need to put grenades in holes.
[279:31.23]Oh, we got a big bug.
[279:31.97]Big bug.
[279:37.59]Where are you guys going?
[279:38.91]You say where to and you guys run in the other direction.
[279:41.33]No, no, no.
[279:41.67]We're good.
[279:41.89]We're good.
[279:42.27]We're good.
[279:45.87]We got to shoot his butthole.
[279:57.98]Are you going to charge me or what?
[280:06.10]He asked him.
[280:12.70]Ow.
[280:14.52]Oh my gosh.
[280:15.22]What in the name of God is happening?
[280:17.50]I got you.
[280:18.22]I think you guys are in the gas is what's happening.
[280:21.40]The hole is right up here.
[280:22.64]I have no grenade.
[280:24.08]I'm coming.
[280:28.24]I spawned on him.
[280:32.49]Oh.
[280:33.89]What the fuck?
[280:38.31]Oh, come on.
[280:39.75]I threw a sentry down.
[280:42.56]Be careful.
[280:44.10]I am out of a lot of stuff.
[280:51.61]No, I didn't want to dodge again.
[281:00.67]There are so many of you motherfuckers right behind me.
[281:19.30]I have no more grenades, but there is a hole right here.
[281:23.49]Got him.
[281:23.77]These things are so hard to kill.
[281:27.15]I am also died.
[281:37.31]But also not for real.
[281:39.43]Fuck.
[281:39.73]Doesn't know where to go.
[281:40.89]Doesn't know where to go.
[281:43.65]I couldn't.
[281:45.32]I tried Tim.
[281:45.76]Holy shit.
[281:51.08]All right, what do we need here everything?
[282:16.30]Alright, I got gas coming.
[282:17.60]No!
[282:20.20]I spawned and died.
[282:21.22]I got you.
[282:23.37]Thank you.
[282:23.69]What the fuck?
[282:27.91]Am I okay?
[282:28.85]I'm alright.
[282:31.01]My fucking nuke just went off!
[282:33.95]And the person you're talking to on the phone, who you know is there, is like, wait, am I okay?
[282:39.06]I don't know,
[282:43.20]How do things look on your end?
[282:44.82]I'm alright.
[282:45.46]I'm touching all over my body.
[282:47.12]My head, my face, my ears, my legs.
[282:48.87]Am I okay?
[282:49.43]Am I good?
[282:50.23]Am I okay?
[282:50.61]Am I bleeding?
[282:50.99]Am I bleeding?
[282:57.13]Yo, what's this?
[283:02.92]Oh, shit.
[283:03.86]That's cool.
[283:12.42]oh my god that just killed so much I don't even think this is a hive anymore bazooka you got like a railgun um oops yeah let's go do the other eggs and then just do side stuff
[283:41.07]Actually, give me the machine gun.
[283:42.39]Why are you guys killing bugs?
[283:53.01]Because they are taking over Earth.
[283:56.68]They're communists.
[283:59.00]They're bugging us.
[284:03.16]You guys get it?
[284:04.16]Oh, shit.
[284:08.62]What the fuck?
[284:11.31]Because bugging means you're being annoyed by something.
[284:15.37]Yes.
[284:16.13]Holy shit, dude.
[284:18.77]Write that one down.
[284:19.77]Because nobody else should fucking take that from you.
[284:22.61]I'll put in the joke discord.
[284:26.10]Okay, I'll stop with that one.
[284:28.62]No, I like the discord joke.
[284:31.24]It's good for today, but after today, you know.
[284:33.02]Yeah.
[284:34.58]It's got 24 hours of life on it.
[284:36.71]Yeah.
[284:47.36]Oh, big guy.
[284:51.12]Requesting orbital strikes!
[285:03.23]Get some!
[285:03.97]Get some!
[285:05.45]I'm gonna go for the hole.
[285:15.13]Stop chasing me!
[285:16.03]God damn it!
[285:19.50]I love going for the hole.
[285:20.62]I'm bleeding out.
[285:26.23]Leave me alone, dude.
[285:28.01]He won't leave me alone.
[285:29.09]Left reload.
[285:32.69]Oh, that's... Butt destroyed.
[285:37.25]Wait, he's alive?
[285:43.83]Oh, we have a whole nest situation over there.
[285:48.02]Another one.
[285:50.24]Another one.
[285:51.50]Another.
[285:55.40]I need to get a strike out.
[285:56.70]Alright, napalm is going out over there.
[286:04.27]I don't know where it's going to be.
[286:05.29]Just be careful.
[286:05.87]It's going to streak across.
[286:08.85]That was actually pretty clean.
[286:30.40]Big guy, big guy, big guy.
[286:31.38]I'm dead.
[286:42.71]Oh, they're on me.
[286:43.49]I got a lot of guys on me.
[286:46.81]You good poke?
[286:47.99]Yeah.
[286:49.21]You calling him in?
[286:50.91]Or should I?
[286:52.43]I got him.
[286:54.45]Does the dive have any like iframes or anything or is it just like a way to get out of the way?
[286:59.64]Um, I don't know.
[287:00.68]Because they keep trying to use it as a means to dive, but it almost... They try to get out of the way of the big guys, but it feels like I'm way slower after landing and they get me anyways.
[287:11.30]The big ones just charge in a straight line.
[287:13.34]You need to like buffalo, bull them, bull them.
[287:17.22]Roll left.
[287:18.78]As they're coming, they don't turn.
[287:26.63]I'm quite separated from the gang.
[287:36.63]Run away.
[287:37.17]I'll go towards the egg.
[287:42.95]Reloading.
[287:44.57]I got a bunch following me.
[287:52.55]That is a lot of people.
[287:55.18]They're not people.
[287:56.46]I'm clustering behind right there.
[287:58.98]Holy shit.
[288:03.16]They just obliterated everybody.
[288:13.36]Yo, full squad wipe.
[288:14.88]Watch out circles moving in.
[288:15.88]They're reporting on me.
[288:21.62]What?
[288:21.96]I got one tap.
[288:24.08]Unless someone with a shotgun got me.
[288:25.82]No, it's not.
[288:28.68]That thing one taps you.
[288:34.48]He's up.
[288:36.56]That thing hurts a lot.
[288:41.59]what the fuck was that I don't know what was that I don't know you almost killed me too I didn't do it I didn't press any button I think it was a was it a mine there's a huge hive in front of the eggs that we're gonna have to deal with here the smoke plants oh
[289:12.70]I probably should have done that.
[289:16.50]You never know.
[289:20.90]My resupply.
[289:22.66]All right there.
[289:33.05]Oh, boy.
[289:39.21]I.
[289:43.69]Oh, poke, I'm so sorry.
[289:45.29]I shot you right in the fucking head.
[289:47.69]You punched my ass.
[289:54.06]I got you.
[289:56.26]Whoa, run.
[290:03.00]I landed on it.
[290:03.88]I landed on the big guy.
[290:04.72]Ooh, nice.
[290:06.20]I killed him.
[290:07.50]Guys are following me.
[290:08.38]Help!
[290:15.38]No, stop!
[290:17.72]I hit the Windows key and I hit the entire southwestern part of my keyboard United States at the same time.
[290:29.07]We've got a bug problem.
[290:34.69]Oh, jeez!
[290:36.72]I'm just running.
[290:51.91]All right, I have napalm come and run.
[290:55.93]I feel like I'm going to get hit by that.
[291:02.21]Was for the best.
[291:03.03]OK, that's a sacrifice.
[291:04.79]I'm running away from the we're running away from the.
[291:07.67]Yeah, I just I just.
[291:10.31]Do not run.
[291:14.79]That was great actually.
[291:16.81]That just killed everything.
[291:18.89]Oh nice.
[291:24.76]If anyone has any resupplies, go for it.
[291:26.56]I'm going to throw orbital in there.
[291:33.72]I don't know.
[291:36.48]The one returning to destroy for resupply reloading.
[291:41.86]Oh, what happened this year?
[291:43.36]I got it.
[291:43.66]I got it.
[291:43.88]Yeah.
[291:44.10]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[291:46.93]Pokey lol.
[291:50.41]I got you.
[291:53.10]That's a lot of bugs.
[291:56.33]That's a lot of bugs.
[292:02.71]Where did I just go?
[292:08.42]Nobody knows.
[292:11.40]I appreciate how many revives this game gives you.
[292:14.22]Yeah.
[292:14.84]Cause it's just, I thought it was going to be like one and done.
[292:18.89]Even when you all die, you rez.
[292:21.01]You guys pick up all my stuff?
[292:23.65]Looks like you did.
[292:26.59]They are a rare sample.
[292:28.36]Somebody else pick this up in case I don't go into the plane.
[292:33.88]Good plan, good plan.
[292:35.08]Okay.
[292:38.87]Oh, dude.
[292:42.43]If only we knew this was here.
[292:47.31]Did you say you want to resupply or did we get it already?
[292:50.11]I died so it doesn't matter.
[292:51.75]We're going to the eggs.
[292:53.41]I have somebody's shotgun.
[292:55.55]That's mine.
[292:58.42]If it was the Breach shotgun.
[293:00.04]Yeah, that's whatever because it's probably going to have no ammo.
[293:21.82]All right.
[293:23.64]Hey, it's a little like this.
[293:28.32]We're just we're just orbital striking all over the place over here.
[293:31.32]Calling in orbital strike.
[293:33.66]Ideally, you land, you hit next to the hole.
[293:36.61]I'm just trying to actually destroy holes.
[293:38.43]20 minutes remaining.
[293:41.87]Be careful.
[293:42.35]I just.
[293:46.59]You're right.
[293:47.43]Where are they?
[293:51.04]OK.
[293:52.79]Oh, okay.
[293:54.59]It killed me and I dropped the thing I was holding.
[294:02.21]That's really bad.
[294:03.91]That was damage.
[294:12.02]That was unlucky.
[294:17.40]Eagle is coming in.
[294:36.38]OK, I'm going to try to get her grenade in there.
[294:38.04]Oh no, I'm not.
[294:41.92]No, I am not.
[294:42.68]No, I am not aren't big armored boy.
[294:46.72]I have no grenades.
[294:49.63]Oh my goodness.

[294:54.51]There's too many.
[294:55.37]There's too many.
[295:15.05]I'm dealing with a lot over here, but hopefully you guys are okay.
[295:18.78]Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.
[295:21.80]I'm cheating.
[295:24.94]Using the high ground.
[295:27.24]No!
[295:27.38]I didn't see where he was.
[295:30.52]Oh, thank you.
[295:31.04]I don't even care if it kills me.
[295:33.82]Oh, what the fuck, man?
[295:34.92]Oh, the orb will hit him.
[295:40.28]I got no ammo.
[295:43.63]Please don't kill me.
[295:44.79]Please don't kill me.
[295:51.31]I'm dead.
[296:05.66]Fuck me.
[296:09.48]This is our last reinforce.
[296:11.78]I'm sick height.
[296:14.01]I would just throw something down.
[296:15.65]Yeah.
[296:16.37]Requesting orbital strike.
[296:29.52]That was that was like.
[296:32.03]Very tricky.
[296:34.83]I'm actually stuck in the.
[296:37.51]If you guys can see me, I'm stuck in this thing.
[296:40.61]Oh no.
[296:41.95]But you are stuck.
[296:45.51]But they can't hurt me.
[296:47.35]Wait, they're... Whoa!
[296:52.77]Where are you?
[296:55.09]Don't scream and then make me scream.
[297:00.86]Get the fuck out of here.
[297:07.20]Yeah, fuck you guys.
[297:15.34]I don't know how I did this, but I'm up here and I just killed like everything.
[297:18.38]Alright, gas going on up here.
[297:40.69]I'm scared to get down.
[297:52.93]They're not dead?
[297:53.57]Yeah, Poe, can you just shoot them?
[297:59.60]They're kind of just like... Yeah, they're just like all up on me.
[298:03.00]Got that perfect angle.
[298:06.84]Alright, cool.
[298:08.68]Wait, I can just do a... We gotta destroy eggs.
[298:11.81]I threw an orb on you, though.
[298:12.83]You should probably run.
[298:13.49]Oh my goodness.
[298:25.42]Oh my God.
[298:25.78]Alright, where are these eggs?
[298:44.11]No.
[298:46.15]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[298:49.40]Oh boy.
[298:51.46]I have a rez.
[298:52.38]I don't know who's going to use it.
[298:54.38]But I'm running.
[298:56.76]Oh!
[298:58.43]I have no grenades.
[298:59.29]Shit!
[299:00.13]Wait a minute.
[299:04.65]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[299:05.41]I might be able to get it.
[299:15.37]Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[299:18.96]Excuse me!
[299:22.48]Eat shit, bug fuck!
[299:28.21]Nice.

[299:39.54]Coming to you, sir.
[299:41.24]Injury?
[299:43.48]What injury?
[299:47.20]Jesus, dude.
[299:50.76]Coming to you.
[299:53.48]I'm sorry.
[299:54.08]I just expelled all of my gamer battery to do what I just did.
[299:57.14]I'm very sorry.
[299:59.95]You did great.
[300:04.25]Yeah, we didn't get all the eggs.
[300:06.09]Really?
[300:06.33]No.
[300:07.29]We're going to have to go back in, but we can wait for like 40 seconds for poke.
[300:12.35]Yeah.
[300:12.51]What are we going to do?
[300:15.93]Hold down this area.
[300:17.44]Throw me in there.
[300:26.28]Requesting advanced weaponry.
[300:37.79]Give me that machine gun.
[300:45.31]You orbital in like one guy.
[300:46.56]No.
[300:47.50]Why do you say that?
[300:56.14]Calling in reinforced.
[300:57.29]Alright, you got it.
[300:57.91]Yeah, I can do.
[301:00.69]I can do hadoukens.
[301:03.35]Do you play fighting games?
[301:04.15]You don't know what you're doing?
[301:14.19]No, I think you destroyed the resupply.
[301:17.23]What?
[301:17.51]I think you shot it and I saw it explode.
[301:20.71]Or maybe a bug walked through it.
[301:22.47]I hope I didn't do that.
[301:23.43]That would be really sad.
[301:27.67]Oh, I just... Stay away from my bomb.
[301:31.15]Please.
[301:31.81]My map bugged out.
[301:33.58]My map bugged out.
[301:35.90]This game is weird.
[301:37.28]Bro, what?
[301:39.66]No, you have to...
[301:43.58]What do you mean your map you throw it no I I
[301:59.14]On the map if you want to... If you are carrying a thingy and you click a waypoint, it throws it.
[302:06.57]I swear.
[302:07.07]I swear.
[302:08.15]Oh man, that sucks.
[302:10.01]Yeah.
[302:11.01]I don't know if I trust you afterwards.
[302:12.91]Believe me, just trust it.
[302:14.45]We'll resin test it.
[302:16.35]Mythbusters, we're gonna test this.
[302:17.77]Oh, that was so fucking funny.
[302:19.39]Oh my god.
[302:24.73]Hey, we're still in it.
[302:26.81]Yeah, 30 seconds.
[302:27.59]We're good.
[302:29.87]Like, it didn't even happen.
[302:30.61]We're fine.
[302:32.31]There's gotta be, like, one egg to destroy in here.
[302:34.44]Let's just hide like this.
[302:36.78]We do only have 11 minutes to do this and run back.
[302:41.46]Gotta be careful.
[302:48.13]Oh, shit.
[302:53.74]Stir, you take this, please.
[302:56.31]I don't know if we can choose.
[302:57.99]I think you pressed space.
[303:07.71]Oh shit, it's me.
[303:09.11]Great.
[303:09.79]Oh, it's me.
[303:11.53]Oh, great.
[303:12.91]This got tagged in.
[303:13.83]It's like the bottom of the ninth inning.
[303:15.25]I'm pinch hitting right now.
[303:16.35]This is not good.
[303:17.81]I have like a .2.
[303:18.41]Run behind me, run behind me, run behind me.
[303:29.29]Where are these eggs?
[303:30.22]Dude, we're so far away from the eggs, man.
[303:34.24]My orb was right on that guy, though.
[303:37.85]No, don't want to.
[303:42.67]Napalming over there.
[303:43.49]Watch out.
[303:49.61]I'm in.
[303:51.45]Oh boy.
[303:56.15]Oh boy.
[304:00.02]A minute.
[304:01.98]We're going so far away from the eggs.
[304:03.82]It's better probably if you could stand somewhere safe.
[304:07.22]We just walk in together one time.
[304:13.85]No, no, no.
[304:16.81]No.
[304:18.11]I'm in trouble.
[304:18.75]I'm in a lot of trouble actually.
[304:20.33]Oh, there's no way I'm getting out of this.
[304:21.33]There's so many...
[304:33.33]I'm somehow still alive.
[304:35.35]I don't know how.
[304:35.75]Keep running.
[304:36.07]We're good.
[304:44.02]20 seconds.
[304:48.34]I can't run.
[304:48.92]My stamina is gone.
[304:49.78]I'm killing everything.
[305:00.88]Thank God for the resupply.
[305:05.89]I got Easter.
[305:06.43]I'm going to try and land on that bug.
[305:17.24]Oh, you got it?
[305:18.34]Oh, thank God you got it.
[305:19.32]Nice.
[305:20.96]Okay.
[305:23.26]That was something.
[305:25.38]Okay.
[305:25.62]Where are these fucking eggs?
[305:26.70]Oh, we did a full retreat.
[305:28.26]I'm running right towards it.
[305:30.70]Eight minutes.
[305:31.46]Oh, my God.
[305:33.08]There's totally like one set of eggs in there.
[305:39.81]I'm so sad about that thing, but damn.
[305:42.78]Try it.
[305:43.24]Okay, made it, uh... We're still here.
[305:47.81]We got full health.
[305:49.71]Three of us.
[305:51.13]By the time we get over there, we'll have another rez.
[305:52.91]So that's good.
[306:09.80]I think I'm just going to throw my turret in here.
[306:13.25]Here.
[306:13.45]Here, eggs all in here.
[306:45.80]Let's go.
[306:46.34]Let's get out of here.
[306:49.28]Quick run.
[306:55.09]Where are we running to?
[306:56.01]OK, this way.
[307:05.87]My God.
[307:14.11]I might bomb Steve.
[307:15.07]Stir, you alright?
[307:16.97]Yeah, I'm trying to... Just throw some holes.
[307:22.02]I'm gonna throw an A-palm behind us.
[307:23.94]Just run past it.
[307:27.40]Throwing it right now.
[307:28.08]Just be aware, be careful.
[307:33.36]Throwing behind us too.
[307:35.12]I'm really far away from you guys.
[307:39.03]We got six minutes.
[307:45.73]Bunch to the right.
[307:47.88]I'm going to bomb this way.
[307:49.12]Ready?
[307:49.32]Come next to me.
[307:50.58]Come next to me.
[307:50.90]Come next to me.
[307:51.46]Got him.
[307:51.68]Got him.
[307:52.68]I'm so far away.
[307:53.74]Nice.
[307:57.06]I'm going to grab this rocket launcher because I need it.
[307:59.94]Okay.
[308:00.24]Let's go.
[308:10.76]Supplies there is.
[308:17.90]I'm surprised you're still alive.
[308:18.84]Sturges.
[308:20.01]I'm throwing gas run towards us.
[308:33.63]Put on the light arm or something.
[308:34.81]At least I caught up with you.
[308:35.91]5 minutes left.
[308:38.85]We can't stay this little much longer.
[308:40.97]Oh my goodness, I just run into them every time.
[308:50.41]We do have a resurrect if we need it.
[308:55.69]I'm going to set up my turret down here.
[308:57.19]We could just hold the high ground.
[308:58.31]Oh no, I got 20 seconds on the turret.
[309:02.59]I did it.
[309:03.03]Alright, let's do it.
[309:26.92]I want that machine gun.
[309:29.28]I'm doing close throws at our base.
[309:31.64]Right this way.
[309:40.33]Very nice.
[309:40.77]God, I hope we make it out of here alive.
[309:49.39]I was going to retire tomorrow.
[310:04.62]Are we doing good Should be fine Sounds to blow you up
[310:31.74]You're a great combo of like you do really well and also you constantly bomb us.
[310:38.32]Hey, it is killing a lot of bugs when you do that though.
[311:00.02]I actually didn't mean it.
[311:00.82]That one was a mistake.
[311:02.16]Every other one was like a weird mistake.
[311:06.23]Every other one was like a bug.
[311:07.55]Oh, because there were bugs.
[311:11.65]No, test the... Take out a stratagem right now and then try to mark your waypoint.
[311:18.02]Oh, here it is.
[311:27.17]I'm not gonna be the one that fucks up and doesn't get in.
[311:31.77]Oh, jeez.
[311:36.89]That was a good one.
[311:38.63]That was good.
[311:41.59]That was good.
[311:45.77]Take this team damage, though.
[311:46.87]It's gonna be awesome.
[311:53.56]Oh, it's gonna be me.
[312:04.65]Exactly.
[312:05.99]Now I know what you're putting down.
[312:06.89]5% mission time remaining.
[312:11.63]Okay.
[312:21.11]We just got three.
[312:22.95]Three credits from that.
[312:24.37]Hey, only a thousand more and we can get to that one page.
[312:32.64]Pretty close.
[312:38.18]Alright, I'm looking for a 70 to 80% accuracy on this one for me.
[312:44.37]You shoot three times?
[312:47.28]Actually smart.
[312:49.64]Shoot one time.
[312:53.21]I did much better than the other times.
[312:57.25]I did better.
[312:57.69]I only did six friendly fire damage and one of 14 stims used is kind of crazy.
[313:03.98]But I've got three.
[313:07.56]Are you not healing?
[313:09.08]I'm healing.
[313:09.92]Are you just that good that you just don't get hit?
[313:13.11]Yeah.
[313:15.29]Well, most of my deaths are from poke.
[313:17.41]True.
[313:20.75]Welcome back.
[313:22.53]Well, that was a good one.
[313:25.02]Yep.
[313:26.56]Alright, gamers.
[313:27.92]I am out.
[313:30.50]We should definitely plan some VR fun times.
[313:34.84]Yes.
[313:35.22]Because that sounds like a lot of fun to me.
[313:38.78]Yes, that'll be fun as hell.
[313:40.80]Sounds cute and kawaii.
[313:42.46]I like this game.
[313:43.06]It was fun.
[313:44.45]Yeah, this was fun.
[313:45.65]It was definitely... Especially the last three or four missions where you start to kind of understand how everything's supposed to work.
[313:54.23]Yeah.
[313:55.39]Always a pleasure.
[313:56.03]Poke.
[313:56.49]Good to see you.
[313:57.43]Stir you as well.
[313:58.57]You know how it is.
[314:00.05]I do know how it is.
[314:01.97]And then Vinny.
[314:02.49]I will know how it is one day.
[314:04.01]Vinny.
[314:04.83]Thanks Vinny for playing.
[314:06.11]Even though he's not here.
[314:07.52]Hey Vinny.
[314:09.78]See you next time.
[314:11.44]Yeah.
[314:11.90]See you later.
[314:14.22]Bye bye.
[314:21.79]Yeah, VR would be fun.
[314:24.27]I'm definitely in the space for it.
[314:26.47]The only thing is I just... I might do some seeded.
[314:30.21]Might do half and half.
[314:32.71]Because the last time I set up VR, it just kind of... It kind of kicks the ever-living shit out of me, so... Yeah, I'm going to do a macaroni and cheese review stream.
[314:44.60]That's the next thing you can... I mean, I guess here's two things that are coming up.
[314:49.36]Mac and cheese...
[314:51.81]Review stream.
[314:54.41]That's not going to be tomorrow.
[314:55.71]I was planning on it tomorrow, but I still want to get this two or three boxes that I still want.
[315:04.28]It's not going to be like another month or two though, because I want to do that because I have it.
[315:08.08]I pretty much have all the materials for it.
[315:09.68]I just want a couple more boxes.
[315:12.08]And then maybe whenever we do this VR thing, those are the kind of next two things I've got going on.
[315:18.20]Also, the Grotto Beast TTS, just in case you don't see me for like another week, we had a meeting and we've been talking about putting in about two or three patches into that TTS.
[315:34.87]Fun stuff like toys and maybe some card revisions.
[315:39.38]Fun stuff, decorations.
[315:41.34]We've got a plan for it.
[315:46.14]probably in the spring, summer, and then winter.
[315:49.28]Try to get a few out.
[315:50.00]Because there's stuff in there that, you know, some of the toys are coming soon, and we talked about it, so.
[315:56.89]We're getting a plan going to start moving some content patches through the Grotto Beasts TTS.
[316:04.95]But,
[316:06.53]That is all for today.
[316:08.83]Keep an eye on the sus over the next, um, realistically like the next week.
[316:14.64]It's not going to be like another month for the mac and cheese stream.
[316:18.26]That's not going to happen because I'm already pretty much ready to go.
[316:20.40]So see you in like a week or so.
[316:22.72]Keep an eye on the sus.
[316:24.44]I will update it when I am probably a couple days away, two or three days away.
[316:30.99]That was a lot of fun.
[316:31.55]I love playing with those guys.
[316:38.51]poke is so fucking funny I think poke is the funniest streamer on twitch you know that can I say that I really think he is but yeah yeah poke is in like the top five like definitely of like funniest people on twitch at least in my opinion
[317:13.52]And Stir is up there, too.
[317:15.22]Come on.
[317:19.57]Stir's up there, too.
[317:23.25]You dissing Stir on his birthday.
[317:28.17]No, Stir knows he's number one.
[317:30.38]Come on.
[317:30.80]Do I have to say that?
[317:32.48]He knows it.
[317:34.26]You all know it.
[317:42.99]Stir is grayed out.
[317:43.73]You know what I mean?
[317:46.01]Stir's name is grayed out because it's just like, oh, obviously he's S. You must hate Vinny then.
[317:55.06]No, I don't.
[317:55.48]Vinny's also in the top five.
[318:07.20]Wasn't expecting a five-hour stream today.
[318:09.76]Yeah, I mean, Stuart just kind of hit me up and was like, hey, well, let's play Helldivers when it comes out.
[318:12.88]I was like, okay, that sounds fun.
[318:16.94]No real plan, just... Just doing it.
[318:24.47]Oh, shit.
[318:25.83]Plans to finish Sorcery.
[318:27.17]I was going to bring it up in that call to see if somebody would play it.
[318:32.71]I was going to plant the Sorcery seeds...
[318:36.18]Oh, hey, like, Vinny, play Sorcery.
[318:38.50]Because I just want to watch somebody play it.
[318:41.96]Poke.
[318:43.04]You ever hear this game, Sorcery?
[318:44.45]It's right up your alley.
[318:45.83]Play it for me.
[318:47.31]It's only going to take you, like, maybe 100 hours.
[318:50.39]And you have to do it for, like, a week straight.
[318:51.79]But, you know, give it a try.
[318:59.48]Didn't Stir play it already?
[319:09.44]You're reaching the age where you want to watch other people stream your genre.
[319:17.98]I think it's everybody's genre.
[319:20.00]It's a classic, timeless video game.
[319:28.01]Italics played it?
[319:28.57]That's right, Italics did play it.
[319:32.69]I want anybody else.
[319:45.97]I'll finish it.
[319:48.73]I'll finish it eventually.
[319:52.89]All right, guys, I will see you soon.
[319:54.61]Good to see you again.
[319:56.13]I hope everyone's doing well.
[319:57.59]Hope everybody is, you know, getting by.
[320:00.85]Now, this last couple months and in the future, not spending that much time on stream.
[320:08.78]But, you know, when I'm here, let's have some fun like we did right now.
[320:13.51]See you soon.
[320:13.91]See you on the Mac and cheese stream.
[320:14.95]I'll give you a sus update over the next week.
[320:20.72]We can do this now.
[320:32.97]Is it an announcement?
[320:37.23]Now that stream is only going to be an hour.
[320:39.43]It's going to be maybe one to two hours total.
[320:47.35]And then we'll see if we can set up a VR thing with some people.
[321:02.12]And Elden Ring.
[321:04.23]I'm imagining we're getting an announcement here pretty soon.
[321:06.07]I gotta get the blowdown music up here.
[321:11.15]Alright, I'm doing that this time.
[321:15.61]The tracks are just so good and I need to show them more.
[321:26.84]Any games you're currently interested in right now?
[321:32.62]I think everyone's just waiting for GTA 6 and Elden Ring DLC.
[321:38.10]Out of all the games that are coming out, that's probably the ones that I'm actually excited for.
[321:44.99]But who isn't excited for those?
[321:46.50]It's pretty much a given.
[321:49.48]How is Otto?
[321:50.12]I'll give you an Otto update.
[321:51.72]Otto had a dental done.
[321:56.88]It's always scary because they have to put your dog under anesthesia.
[322:03.42]Got his teeth cleaned.
[322:04.90]He did have to get a tooth pulled.
[322:06.37]He had one kind of bad tooth in the back.
[322:10.25]But he's good now.
[322:11.51]He's perfect.
[322:12.37]Teeth are perfectly clean.
[322:13.35]He's happy.
[322:13.95]He's healthy.
[322:15.49]And he's doing better than ever, so.
[322:22.88]In fact, the last like six months.
[322:27.23]Because, you know, he has Addison's and everything.
[322:28.93]I feel like with this vet, we've been getting him on a couple of new things.
[322:33.29]Because he has arthritis in his hands, too.
[322:36.06]So he's on a couple of medications.
[322:38.60]But I'll tell you, the last six months, the last three to six months, he has been as energetic, as healthy, and as active as I've ever seen him.
[322:48.55]So he is doing fantastic right now.
[322:51.63]truly fantastic so that's really great because he's 13 so he's getting up there in age but he is doing wonderfully
[323:16.16]Alright, everybody.
[323:16.74]See you soon.
[323:17.34]See you later.

[323:41.30]Get off the computer and, like, catch up with some people.
