[07:06.26]Why?
[07:10.81]There we are.
[07:11.91]Check your surroundings.
[07:12.78]Make sure there's nobody to clock in the face with a fucking clock.
[07:17.60]Is my head lopsided?
[07:20.90]I think it is.
[07:21.74]Is it right or left?
[07:24.76]I have a lopsided head now, don't I?
[07:29.02]Get that thing in there.

[09:49.72]Okay, here we are.
[09:50.38]This is the right spot, right?
[09:56.98]Nice, two guns.
[09:58.74]If your arm position does not match that of the player character, you can extend your arms, then press the start button to recalibrate.
[10:04.70]You got it.
[10:08.33]New story, options, level select.
[10:10.91]Alright, before I get started.
[10:13.37]How do we sound?
[10:14.37]Is the audio good?
[10:15.15]Do I sound good?
[10:17.39]Do I sound okay?
[10:24.09]I want to make sure it's like everything's working as intended.
[10:28.69]Okay, good.
[10:30.09]Because I can't see and I can't hear shit.
[10:34.03]Oh, wait, thought.
[10:35.43]Gerber said shit.
[10:45.01]Alright, new story.

[11:02.86]I love every time I put this on my face to adjust to my hands come up.
[11:06.50]Okay, I can't shoot this guy.
[11:10.78]There are wonders beyond this door that will test your skill.
[11:14.29]What's wrong with this gun?
[11:17.28]What happened to this gun?
[11:18.70]Uh, my gun has a sad nose, so I'm not sure what to do about this.
[11:23.68]What happened?
[11:24.66]Over there.
[11:25.16]This gun is so jammed up.
[11:46.01]Reload is this.

[11:58.34]This is very loud.
[12:00.62]Holy shit.
[12:08.84]Oh, I'm not gonna like this.
[12:09.99]Welcome to fucking Frightober.
[12:12.55]Freaktober.
[12:19.83]I thought that baby head was an enemy.
[12:21.67]Is that a guy in front of me?
[12:31.73]Okay.
[12:33.33]Unsafe.
[12:33.89]Keep out.
[12:36.60]Back in business.
[12:37.40]Hippity ho.
[12:38.68]One minute we stop.
[12:40.28]One minute we go.
[12:41.80]Just wait and see what's around the bend.
[12:44.02]And I'll see you when you reach the end.
[12:56.56]I'm doing a good job.
[13:02.92]What's next?
[13:07.58]Preliminary pre-fire.
[13:15.28]Going good so far.
[13:16.78]2200 points.
[13:18.20]That's my phone password.
[13:21.05]I got my phone password amount of points.
[13:34.51]One up top, one at the... What was I thinking?
[13:37.24]One up top, one at the bottom.
[13:50.38]Is this the game?
[13:51.16]What is like the scary game?
[13:55.63]You just have to shoot ducks?
[14:00.43]I mean, this is kind of fun.
[14:04.97]That was pretty good with the Wii mode, as you can tell.
[14:06.52]Let's do like some Wanted shit.
[14:15.67]Just like that movie Wanted with Angelina Jolie.
[14:25.46]Times six?
[14:26.60]What?
[14:34.38]This is kind of fun, actually.
[14:35.42]How is this Until Dawn, by the way?
[14:36.24]I like this game.
[14:36.78]This game's fun.
[14:37.28]Oh, I got 15555.
[14:38.04]That's my PIN number from my credit card.
[14:43.04]In case you were wondering.
[14:44.06]Watch this.
[15:06.30]Multiplayer?
[15:09.01]What?
[15:13.83]It's actually pretty fluid.
[15:26.00]It actually feels pretty nice.
[15:29.64]This is good controls.
[15:30.58]I like it.
[15:32.84]Do I actually have to duck?
[15:41.15]What's that?
[15:42.43]I'm not tall enough.
[15:47.97]Oh god, this is crazy.
[15:51.13]Oh, wow, look at the vid.
[16:00.28]Cat?
[16:02.08]I'm not even sitting down for this.
[16:03.28]This is gonna make, this is gonna fuck up my spatial awareness.
[16:09.89]This is gonna make me sick, because I'm standing right now.
[16:11.99]I don't like this.
[16:16.21]This doesn't feel right.
[16:17.61]This doesn't feel right.
[16:22.48]This doesn't feel right!
[16:26.18]I swear to God, guys, I'm gonna fall over.
[16:27.84]I'm gonna fall over.
[16:30.24]I'm supposed to be sitting down.
[16:34.52]This is not the way this is supposed to be experienced.
[16:39.93]I need to sit down.
[16:40.61]I gotta sit down.
[16:41.69]I gotta sit down.
[16:45.66]I gotta sit down.
[16:48.88]Wait.
[16:49.40]Alright, I'm okay.
[16:52.28]Alright, I'm fine.
[16:52.84]This is a standing desk.
[16:56.45]I'm gonna throw up.
[16:59.23]This is...
[17:18.32]I got better guns.
[17:21.43]What happened there?
[17:21.99]I just got like super bullets.
[17:25.51]That's a guy.
[17:25.97]That's a guy right there.
[17:27.29]Somebody throwing knives.
[17:57.60]It's too much stimulation.
[17:59.74]There's a cat somewhere.
[18:01.97]It's too much stimulation.
[18:03.77]It really is.
[18:05.91]No one's ready for this yet.
[18:07.71]VR has like another 10 years before people can stand it.
[18:11.35]No way.
[18:14.10]Absolutely not a chance.
[18:15.60]It'll never take off.
[18:30.58]I'm so scared.
[18:32.06]Well, that's a person.
[18:41.23]Why would you care about points right now?
[18:46.66]Fucking Harry Potter books.
[19:07.37]God, I don't even know what's in this game.
[19:10.79]Is this the first part or is this the whole game?
[19:30.79]It's not fun.
[19:31.85]It's not fun.
[19:33.05]Don't take my shrieks of enjoyment.
[19:35.83]It's not fun.
[19:38.50]Is there any game where a guy just fucking runs at you?
[19:50.79]Is this too loud?
[19:52.17]I feel like this might be a little too loud.
[19:54.15]Thank God the next game we're playing is we're just gonna climb Mount Everest.
[20:04.11]Oh shit, it's not even saying I'm playing the right game.
[20:06.33]It said I'm playing Everest.
[20:17.02]You can hear them all around you.
[20:28.32]All the jokes are all gone here.
[20:29.58]There's the cat again.
[20:47.40]Oh, those... This is just stupid.
[20:50.42]We're right.
[20:52.08]This is how you do it.
[20:56.59]You gotta get both angles.
[21:23.13]I'm like fucking directing plane traffic.
[21:31.62]I don't like it.
[21:32.48]I don't like this one.
[21:53.75]Not bad.
[21:57.69]I hear, like, gas leaking from somewhere.
[22:09.07]Oh, that was vibration.
[22:10.67]You hear that?
[22:17.06]The fuck is that?
[22:25.06]God damn it.
[22:31.18]God damn it, I hear somebody.
[22:32.66]Fucking god damn car wash.
[22:43.82]Do I have to like, get out of the way?
[23:04.07]Where is he?
[23:04.49]He's right next to me.
[23:05.43]He's right to my left.
[23:09.85]Oh my god.
[23:20.14]I'm sweating.
[23:25.44]This game is making me actually sweat bullets right now.
[23:28.02]Like, just sweating.
[23:42.56]Gotta be.
[23:47.72]Gotta be.
[23:49.80]Look at that.
[23:51.90]Bob Washington, Josh Washington, Chris, Emily, and me at number five.
[23:58.88]I have no friends.
[24:00.18]I'm not even close to being anywhere on the top of the world.
[24:04.54]Local, though.
[24:05.20]These are all my friends here that have played on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4.
[24:11.68]Alright, that's cool.
[24:12.32]So that's it, huh?
[24:15.33]Is that it?
[24:17.45]Is that it?
[24:17.75]Is that the whole game?
[24:21.01]Well, now, listen up, listen up.
[24:22.65]Things have taken an unexpected turn, and I'm the first to admit that... Oh, I got a little more.
[24:27.43]...things corrected.
[24:30.72]The Until Dawn cast.
[24:32.38]One more thing.
[24:33.18]Don't be alarmed.
[24:33.98]God.
[24:34.72]You've inhaled a gas.
[24:38.00]And while there's no harm in it, there is one little side effect.
[24:43.52]You may start to see things that aren't really there.
[24:47.30]Which is why I hesitate to bestow upon you this kind of firepower.
[24:52.33]But you'll need some protection.
[24:54.71]The cycle who's done this is still at large, so I advise you... Get my hair out of the way before I ruin it.
[25:03.65]Beware.
[25:04.85]Beware.
[25:05.83]Let's do this for another few minutes.
[25:07.05]We've got a lot to get through.
[25:08.03]This is not sitting on me right.
[25:10.79]Come on.
[25:11.25]Sit on me right.
[25:16.27]Come on.
[25:16.57]Sit on me right.

[26:13.67]No.
[26:15.53]Well, okay.
[26:17.52]It's worth a shot.
[26:20.84]Oh, God.
[26:21.40]This is fucked up.
[26:30.75]I can see you over there.

[28:53.69]It's a... I hate when it's... Do I go on his mom?
[29:18.29]Ay-yay-yay!
[29:24.79]Going down another fucking rollercoaster now.
[29:27.45]That was me!
[29:35.80]This is ridiculous.
[29:40.07]Okay.
[29:40.41]Get that camera out of my face.
[29:51.68]My head's gone.
[29:54.74]Oh my god, this is too intense.
[29:59.70]It's too many things at the same time.
[30:02.04]I haven't even shot anybody.
[30:03.22]I haven't shot anything.
[30:05.94]I'm like Super Mario Galaxy-ing.
[30:08.52]Ugh.
[30:09.50]Ugh.
[30:11.20]Where am I?
[30:14.56]Huh?
[30:16.56]I'm like not in the right place.
[30:18.58]Something's not right.
[30:20.18]Something's wrong here.
[30:28.29]Jesus.
[30:30.43]We gotta go to a nice relaxing game after this one, guys.
[30:33.37]This is out of bounds for me.
[30:37.42]You know, we talk about, like, funny, like, PSVR puke party.
[30:41.12]Well, that's gonna happen.
[30:42.14]Like, if this part of the game is any indication that I'm gonna throw up, it's gonna happen here.
[30:48.19]Oh my god!
[30:49.25]I'm supposed to be sitting down for this shit.
[31:09.69]I really am shrunk, I told you, I knew it.
[31:20.86]I actually am small.
[31:22.96]I was shrunk for this.
[31:23.72]It's just the beginning of Half-Life 2!
[31:54.73]Fuck you.
[31:56.35]Why won't you die?
[32:06.88]That's not what, that's not, that's not the correct character!
[32:11.79]Wasn't it some guy, wasn't it some teenager with like a god complex?
[32:20.68]B+.
[32:21.66]Not bad.
[32:25.94]Not bad.
[32:27.84]How do I fare over the whole world?
[32:29.40]Let's see.
[32:29.76]I did better than Emily.
[32:39.45]Not bad.
[32:42.33]Alright, what's the verdict?
[32:44.21]Are we... Am I getting out of here?
[32:48.42]Going to the next game?
[32:51.93]I don't know.
[32:52.23]After the pig shit, I think I gotta go.
[32:53.67]I gotta get out of there.
[32:58.11]One more?
[33:00.89]One more.
[33:01.51]One more.
[33:03.15]One more.
[33:04.97]Look, this game was like 20 bucks.
[33:07.23]I gotta get at least my one more out of it.
[33:08.83]And I gotta... This one's gone.
[33:17.38]Last one.
[33:19.04]No matter what, this is it.
[33:20.63]We're done after this one.
[33:21.41]We're moving on to the next one.
[33:22.59]You can't put this off forever.
[33:25.29]Into the heart of darkness.
[33:28.01]I think this is the end of the game anyways.
[33:29.69]It's like a short little 40 minute experience.
[33:33.29]Might as well do it, right?
[33:34.13]Let's make sure we're queued up here.
[33:40.65]Good to go.
[33:41.14]Alright.
[33:41.60]This is it.
[33:42.20]Last one.
[33:45.02]Back to the handguns?
[33:46.32]Yeah.
[33:54.54]I mean, for, like, an on-rails experience, this is, uh, I mean, it's been kind of insane.
[33:57.82]I mean, if you want to, like, goof your friends, like, get this game on Halloween and have them sit down and play it, why not?
[34:05.50]I'm gonna have to, like, open a window.
[34:09.17]Like, of course I picked the sweatiest game to be first.
[34:12.85]I don't know why.
[34:13.41]What the hell was I thinking?
[34:17.95]Sure, Jeremy, pick, like, the most intense, sweaty-ass game to play first.
[34:23.59]I needed to be, like, three drinks deep to play this one.
[34:27.57]We were supposed to start with Mount Everest.
[34:29.17]It's like, you climb Mount Everest, and it's, like, relaxing.
[34:34.94]What have I done?
[34:44.32]That's not an enemy.
[34:47.21]I got him.
[34:49.97]Right in my face.
[34:50.55]Here we go.
[34:51.55]Yeah!
[34:51.93]Fuck you!
[34:52.85]I knew it!
[34:55.58]Not this time.
[34:58.04]Fool me once, shame on you.
[35:01.28]Fool me twice, you're not gonna be able to fucking jump scare me.
[35:05.40]A fool can't be fooled again.
[35:15.69]Whoops.
[35:17.33]Huh?
[35:21.19]Are the birds throwing knives at me?
[35:26.39]Watch out for Jack Frost!
[35:33.80]I want to hold on to this shotgun.
[35:39.59]Alright, we got double shotguns?
[35:43.51]Scream, scream, scream in my face!
[35:56.69]What am I doing?
[36:07.29]No, not another rollercoaster part.
[36:08.83]I'm gonna fucking die.
[36:10.51]No more rollercoaster parts.
[36:12.71]Something else.
[36:13.97]Put me on the teacup ride.
[36:16.99]Ah!
[36:18.29]Ah!
[36:26.73]Fucking god, it's crunching my brain.
[36:29.87]Somebody is sprinkling paper in my brain.
[36:32.25]Stop it!
[36:46.36]Get little, get little.
[36:52.18]Oh my fucking god, that's so dumb.
[37:00.96]It's the end of the game.
[37:02.18]Good.
[37:02.50]Thank you for playing.
[37:03.26]You did a good job.
[37:09.99]It's gonna scream in my face and then it's gonna go backwards.
[37:20.83]What did I just do?
[37:22.25]We're going that way now?
[37:26.13]Right?
[37:26.47]Going that way.
[37:32.17]Oh shit, we are going in.
[37:35.70]Secret!
[37:43.38]Good thing I wasn't on that one.
[37:49.60]What is up there?
[38:02.01]Got him.
[38:14.08]Got it.
[38:14.36]What do, like, pro FPS players say?
[38:16.74]Drop your sensitiv- Drop your sensitivity and extend your arms, right?
[38:27.88]That's not helping.
[38:39.72]She's to my right.
[38:41.52]Blood.
[38:44.76]She's to my left.
[38:45.76]Here she comes.
[38:48.34]Here she- AH!
[38:53.32]Fuck you.
[38:54.30]Goddamn games.
[38:55.78]God.
[38:57.38]I got enough oil coming off my body, you could preheat an oven.
[39:04.62]You could fuckin' preheat the pan with my oil that's coming off my body.
[39:09.52]Why are you not dead?
[39:17.54]The fuck?
[39:27.14]Anybody want some fucking seared fish?
[39:29.73]Just, just rub my face into the fucking pan for two seconds.
[39:34.09]You'll get enough olive oil to last you like fucking two weeks.
[39:47.69]I'm starting to smell too.
[39:51.39]I'm not, I'm kidding.
[39:52.85]It's a joke.
[40:02.94]Okay, what's the final little scare here?
[40:11.20]Final room, right?
[40:12.20]This is it?
[40:20.00]No, no more pigs!
[40:21.14]No more pigs!
[40:21.68]Get rid of them before they scream!
[40:31.89]Before they start screaming, for crying out loud.
[40:33.99]Dammit!
[40:57.61]There she is.
[40:59.75]I got it loaded!
[41:00.95]I'm locked and loaded!
[41:03.79]Locked and loaded!
[41:05.81]Which way?
[41:06.21]This way?
[41:10.33]Oh!
[41:16.22]Jesus!
[41:19.32]What?
[41:21.42]What?
[41:22.26]What?
[41:23.42]What?
[41:24.50]What?
[41:25.26]What?
[41:33.14]Christ!
[41:35.36]Which way am I going?
[41:36.28]I don't know, this way?
[41:38.64]Apparently not that way.
[41:50.54]Just like the fucking Counter-Strike pros.
[41:53.52]Like this.
[41:53.90]And you're supposed to go, you're supposed to move your whole arm around, not just your wrist, right?
[42:01.63]Where are my Counter-Strike pros?
[42:05.12]They're in here somewhere.
[42:12.62]I fuckin', I knew it.
[42:15.55]Got ya, before you could even come after me.
[42:17.47]Well, there's quite a few of you actually.
[42:24.29]Just take their heads off and then I'll threat, right?
[42:31.17]They're all gone.
[42:31.77]They're gonna come out of one of these doors.
[42:37.39]Look, I'm a real rootin' tootin' cowboy, huh?
[42:43.31]Oh, for the love of God.
[42:45.13]It needs to end.
[42:46.17]Please get me to the end.
[42:47.96]It's too much of an extreme experience.
[43:00.44]Mm-hmm.
[43:14.41]Panicking.
[43:14.81]I'm panicking.
[43:15.79]I'm panicking right now.
[43:16.67]Panic.
[43:17.51]Panic is set in.
[43:22.07]Just under pressure.
[43:23.16]Just completely and totally fucking flopping under pressure.
[43:25.52]You know what I mean?
[43:30.42]Is it like Big Boo?
[43:31.68]Do they react if you don't look?
[43:33.74]I think it is.
[43:38.24]Yup, it is.
[43:38.70]It is.
[43:38.92]It's just like Big Boo.
[43:42.27]Holy shit!
[43:52.05]Die!
[43:53.29]What does it take?
[43:55.72]Can you see the sweat coming off my body?
[43:57.60]This is like the most intense horror game.
[43:59.95]Even though it's not, it's just a shooter, but it's hurting me.
[44:02.13]Alright, here comes the Scooby Doo encounter.
[44:11.11]They're gonna run from room to room.
[44:25.83]Give me more plates.
[44:27.10]I could care less.
[44:30.32]Fuuuuck!
[44:44.86]Alright, this is the police!
[44:47.02]Come out with your hands up!
[44:48.82]And nobody needs to die!
[44:58.81]Those aren't knives.
[45:00.45]Okay.
[45:08.42]Imagine getting called to the scene of this crime.
[45:10.50]Imagine getting the dispatcher puts you through.
[45:14.50]Yeah, there's a demon woman.
[45:16.06]What do you do?
[45:19.62]Yeah, you gotta go get the heart, Officer Bill!
[45:31.52]I just lit myself on fire.
[45:36.76]Where's my health?
[45:49.01]What is she doing with that move?
[46:12.54]I can't get off- I can't get off of that duck!
[46:32.91]It's all over for me!
[46:34.55]Oh, come on!
[46:37.32]Oh, god damn it!
[46:38.38]I was right there!
[46:39.20]Fuck!
[46:43.38]It's so awkward.
[46:44.40]Why do you have to be so awkward?
[46:49.60]I'm killing this piece of shit.
[46:57.73]Alright, get it done.
[47:20.16]Fuck you!
[47:20.68]Fuck!
[47:21.00]No!
[47:25.78]Here we go.
[47:49.91]I would rather not have the shotgun.
[47:51.13]I really would.
[47:52.59]I don't want the shotguns.
[47:53.41]They're too inaccurate.
[47:54.21]And I have it anyways now, apparently.
[48:04.46]Shoot the fucking gun!
[48:08.00]Oh, the fucking shot.
[48:08.90]The shotgun sucks.
[48:11.10]Get rid of it.
[48:11.68]I don't want it anymore.
[48:24.75]Get the fuck out of here!
[48:26.75]Oh my god, it's so awful!
[48:36.02]Just come on!
[48:42.77]I win!
[48:43.35]I win!
[48:43.59]Get me out of this fucking game!
[48:46.57]What the fuck?
[48:47.75]It's not over.
[48:48.37]It's not over.
[48:48.89]It's the ring lady!
[48:54.64]The Ring Lady!
[48:55.20]My hair is stuck.
[49:00.19]Ow!
[49:05.49]Ow!
[49:05.55]Ow!
[49:05.73]Ow!
[49:05.85]How did- Ow!
[49:34.02]I'm already losing my fucking hair.
[49:35.26]You think I need any more help?
[49:39.73]Jesus.
[49:40.51]Criminy.
[49:42.15]Jiminy Cricket.
[49:45.19]Alright, I beat it.
[49:47.99]Going fucking bald tonight, boys and girls.
[49:51.41]Alright, I win the game.
[49:52.27]That's the game.
[49:53.61]That's not the whole game?
[50:02.61]This has to be the finale.
[50:03.73]I mean, we're this fucking far.
[50:05.09]God damn it.
[50:06.41]Now, now, now, friend.
[50:08.35]You know and I know that all this consternation is just because of the gas.
[50:14.06]Strong stuff.
[50:15.32]Makes funny pictures in the head.
[50:17.16]But what we need to do is get you to a specialist.
[50:21.61]And I know just the spot.
[50:22.83]It's a cozy little clinic just down the line with all the best people.
[50:26.33]This has got to be it.
[50:27.37]This is the end of the game.
[50:28.85]Every specialist you could hope for.
[50:30.81]They even specialize in special cases.
[50:35.36]Nice.
[50:35.60]Just like yours.
[50:37.34]This is gone.
[50:38.54]So what do you say?
[50:39.56]Treat yourself to a treatment?
[50:41.56]Wouldn't want to realize now, would we?
[50:44.14]Alright.
[50:44.46]We're in the right hands here.
[50:45.71]I don't... Wait a minute.
[50:47.17]Is this the right... Where do your thumbs go?
[50:51.13]With this far, I'm almost at fucking quarter of a million goddamn points.
[50:55.77]I'm almost at a million points.
[51:03.08]Once I get to one million, this is the end.
[51:07.96]Here comes the finale.
[51:17.09]My, like, legs hurt.
[51:23.52]Alright, now we're actually playing Until Dawn.
[51:28.94]Sure.
[51:29.64]Go ahead.
[51:30.29]Go ahead.
[51:31.21]Yeah.
[51:32.81]Well, at least we know the scary lady won't show up again because she's dead.
[51:35.73]I don't want to go that way.
[51:44.25]We're going this way.
[51:45.63]I'm not going to the skull and crossbones way.
[51:48.03]No thanks.
[52:04.19]Will say this has been like pretty fun so far and I'm still interested Come on get out of here
[52:28.73]Alright.
[52:28.99]Finale.
[52:29.23]Let's see it.
[52:36.38]Fucking fuck.
[52:37.76]Why did I do that?
[52:38.54]I probably needed that.
[52:39.60]I needed that.
[52:40.82]I needed that bad and I just used it because I'm a fucking idiot and I see something and I do it.
[52:46.52]It's gonna be right in my face over here.
[52:48.18]God damn it.
[52:49.25]Get ready.
[52:52.93]Don't flinch.
[52:53.49]No flinching at this.
[52:54.75]Absolutely none.
[52:59.41]Oh, they actually have, like, a Dark Souls deck.
[53:06.38]Okay.
[53:10.70]Okay.
[53:20.79]Well, this is fucking extremely difficult now.
[53:53.97]Whatever.

[55:26.83]This is going so slow.
[55:28.81]Fuck yeah, my arm!
[55:52.27]I can't.
[55:53.95]I can't.
[55:55.21]I just, like, wedged my arm.
[55:57.99]I've, you know, I've, like, done that before.
[56:01.48]I've actually done that before.
[56:03.42]I've, like, wedged my arm, like, not that exact scenario, but... Knew it.
[56:13.78]I can't get over it.
[56:29.63]Ah, I love it.

[58:25.05]Alright, who installed the fucking funny mod?
[58:28.75]Honest to god.
[58:31.43]Which one of you guys installed the crazy funny mod?
[58:53.78]Don't waste the bullets, you idiot.
[59:11.51]What do I have to do?

[61:05.40]What are you doing up there?
[61:08.26]Get out, no!
[61:20.95]Why is this more intense than Resident Evil 7?
[61:46.93]Got him!
[61:49.78]Got it!
[61:55.20]Is he still there?
[62:22.74]Oh!
[62:23.02]Don't do it too close to me.
[62:24.04]Don't do it that close.
[62:30.36]Oh!
[62:35.24]Oh my god, this is so intense.
[62:37.90]Oh no!

[77:52.98]This time, I'm, like, sitting down.
[77:56.37]So let me make sure, like, this shit's in the right spot.
[78:01.23]Look at my fucking hair.

[78:04.90]That's alright.

[78:15.16]This is gonna be alright too, right?
[78:16.85]Yeah, I need to sit down, guys.
[78:18.03]Like, it's just fucking seriously...
[78:22.29]We got short fucking cord And you're certain you never put this shit where it where it is It just ends up tangled around something that you it's like a fucking ghost at it.
[78:40.92]I Don't get that shit.
[78:42.72]I really don't Alright.
[78:44.40]This is our roller coaster dreams See if our fucking dreams come true when we play
[78:52.12]Roller Coaster Dreams.
[79:09.79]Got it.
[79:11.28]Star Ride.

[79:36.03]Daddy's ready to game.
[79:39.87]It's such an ordeal to fucking get this shit going, I swear to God.
[79:43.73]You wanna know why VR will never fucking take off?
[79:47.25]Because for you to set this up, for you to, like, do, like, VR, you've got to, like, schedule a whole work day to do it.
[79:53.86]You can't just come home, like, late at night after working and just pop on and play, like, a round of, like, Smite.
[79:59.13]No, no, no.
[79:59.85]No, you can't just, like, play a round of Overwatch.
[80:01.93]You've got to, like, dedicate a whole room, like, a work day to getting this to work.
[80:07.29]It's a fucking fad.
[80:08.16]It'll never take off.
[80:11.57]Alright, give me my controllers.
[80:14.23]Let's do it.
[80:15.29]This is not correct.
[80:16.49]This is playing- Fucking little shit.
[80:22.56]It hits the fucking right of the left ear.
[80:25.54]I think the right ear is broken.
[80:26.60]No, I just had it in backwards.
[80:29.92]Now I gotta get the- I just wanted to come home from work and play a fucking game of Overwatch!
[80:38.46]Here we go.
[80:39.60]For real.
[80:48.12]Can I not?
[80:48.58]What the hell is going on?
[80:50.20]I don't want to save a video clip.
[80:53.70]Do I have to use the controller for this?
[80:56.07]No.
[80:56.87]I don't want to do this!
[80:58.03]Get out of here!
[81:01.75]Go!
[81:04.39]You need the controller.
[81:05.33]Oh my god.
[81:06.89]What the fuck is that?
[81:08.23]It's not even charged.
[81:14.34]This music is making me want to scream.
[81:18.19]It's tearing off the music.
[81:20.27]This is like the music you play in hell.
[81:25.68]Okay.
[81:27.70]So, I need to... Fuck.
[81:31.55]This thing is not even charged.
[81:43.59]Okay, park just park made a new game normal new game Okay, good here we go My hair
[82:11.38]I just want to get out of work and play and play a game of fucking like Assassin's Creed Who cares Okay, welcome to roller coaster dreams.
[82:29.27]This is a place to build your amusement park, huh?
[82:33.93]Oh God damn it.
[82:36.69]I have to plug this controller in
[82:39.73]For the love of fucking- all that is sacred.
[83:06.78]Fucking piece of shit, man.
[83:07.98]I swear to God.
[83:14.40]Hey, let's play a fucking scary game again!
[83:26.77]Fucking... It'll never take off.
[83:31.33]Yeah, here's the thing, right?
[83:33.43]So my controller's battery is dead.
[83:36.04]But, like, I need to... I have to, like, plug in the controller.
[83:39.90]Which, I don't even know where the fuck that cord is.
[83:42.91]Because it ain't this one.
[83:43.87]Because this is for PS Move.
[83:45.05]And then the other one's plugged into the PSVR.
[83:47.47]It uses up one of my slots.
[83:50.79]So, I, like, don't even know where that fucking cord is.
[83:54.92]So, now we're gonna play fucking Paranormal Activity.
[83:59.51]Because I have no idea where another USB cable is.
[84:02.12]And that's another thing.
[84:02.80]Like, fucking, what, like, none of this shit's universal.
[84:05.66]Like, for instance, like, this is for the PS Move controller, right?
[84:09.40]Like this.
[84:10.58]There's another slot here for, like, the PS4.
[84:12.81]Like, why can't they be the same fucking goddamn slot?
[84:16.29]Why did they have to change it to, like, the little mini, like, little piece of shit USB, and they had this one for, like, fucking eight years?
[84:22.68]I don't understand.
[84:26.60]I don't get it.
[84:28.08]Just keep it as the same mini USB.
[84:29.96]What's the fucking difference?
[84:33.89]Micro USB.
[84:35.05]Now it's mini USB.
[84:36.85]Micro USB.
[84:37.99]Fucking large USB.
[84:39.33]Fat guy USB.
[84:40.31]Just make it fucking one.
[84:41.63]One.
[84:41.91]Why do you need more than one?
[84:44.72]And a hundred fucking dollars.
[84:45.94]Hold on a second.
[84:49.44]Local man yells at... Ben.
[84:51.78]Ben Eleanor just gave a hundred dollars.
[84:56.72]Thank you for the fucking $100, dude.
[84:58.80]Like, as I sit here looking like a clown.
[85:02.47]Thanks a lot, dude.
[85:03.35]I appreciate it.
[85:05.37]That's $200 fucking dollars tonight.
[85:08.79]You gave like $200 or $300 last night.
[85:10.31]You're up to like $500 or $600 fucking dollars in two days.
[85:13.12]Jesus, man.
[85:15.72]I think I just broke the PSVR.
[85:19.84]Well, I know what I'm going to be spending that money on.
[85:23.00]Thanks, dude.
[85:28.85]to this.
[85:30.13]Alright, what?
[85:35.53]Oh, this is, I actually think I may have done something wrong.
[85:39.93]Oh shit, I did something wrong.
[85:47.92]No, I didn't.
[85:48.52]It's okay, right?
[85:49.40]Right?

[86:18.21]It like popped loose somehow.
[86:24.03]Oh, this is bad.
[86:25.47]This is really bad.
[86:30.10]What the fuck?
[86:31.62]It looks like it can be moved.
[86:34.91]Shit.
[86:38.45]Let me keep tugging.
[86:39.99]I'm trying not to.
[86:42.27]This piece up here is too far down now.

[86:59.59]Get the tape.
[87:01.95]Well, I'm gonna have to deal with it.
[87:06.75]Fucking PSVR.
[87:08.01]Thank God it's like only $200 now.
[87:10.13]That thing sucks.
[87:14.81]Like, what a disservice.
[87:16.83]What a disservice to you all.
[87:18.00]There we go.
[87:20.46]Alright, let's go.
[87:21.26]I gotta fucking... We got... Where's the other PS Move controller?
[87:27.42]Like, it's like shocking to me that this was more than like $40.
[87:30.64]No, that's not even true.
[87:32.10]Don't say that.
[87:34.34]The thing sucks, though, so don't even worry about it.
[87:40.58]Fucking, yeah.

[87:55.01]What the fuck was that?
[87:56.11]Why did you do that?
[87:57.79]There's no reason for that.
[87:59.85]Oh, my God.

[93:36.31]I couldn't be in a better position.
[93:39.50]This game was like 40 fucking dollars.
[93:42.86]And you're telling me I can't even fucking pick up the shit on the table.
[93:50.61]Like, I have to... Look at how fucking far back I have to be.
[93:54.76]Nobody can do this in their living room.
[93:56.30]Are you shitting me?
[94:06.36]What the fuck are you...
[94:24.89]This is such a fucking mess.
[94:30.76]This is crouch?
[94:43.72]To click an on-screen, what do you mean to click an on-screen button?
[94:48.44]Like, what am I hitting here?
[95:06.26]What a fucking revolution.
[95:09.32]What a revolution.
[95:19.88]Okay.
[95:20.40]Thanks, Dad.
[95:23.57]Good work.
[95:24.03]Are you ready?
[95:24.67]Yes, I think I'm ready to play.
[95:26.25]Mother of God.
[95:33.51]Why do you keep doing that for?
[95:37.52]Paranormal activity.
[95:38.74]The lost soul.
[95:40.38]I feel like I'm 95 years old.
[95:42.48]New game.
[95:43.36]Tutorial.
[95:46.24]Options or credits.
[95:47.97]I'd like to do a new game.
[95:49.57]And I'd like to do it in this save slot one.
[95:54.45]Okay, I understand it.
[95:56.83]Difficulty normal, please.
[96:00.01]Paranormal activity.
[96:01.28]Lost soul.
[96:01.80]Do you want to start a new... Get the fuck over there.
[96:10.17]It still says I'm playing, like, Mount Everest, by the way.
[96:13.53]Can, like, can somebody change that to make that, say, paranormal activity?
[96:17.26]I'm still crouching.
[96:23.16]Here we go.
[96:24.10]Time to get scared.
[96:24.92]It only took us, like, a fucking full work day to get it to work.
[96:37.33]Is it paranormal?
[96:38.27]Who am I?
[96:40.36]Isn't paranormal activity like a family in a house?
[96:43.54]Why am I just some guy in their front lawn?
[96:54.58]This is just gone home.
[96:58.06]What does that say?
[97:04.37]Hey, I swung by to return the key.
[97:06.91]It's in the usual hiding spot.
[97:09.05]Let me know when you're ready to get back on the market.
[97:11.37]This has gone home.
[97:19.32]Wait, where's the key?
[97:22.32]Wait, what?
[97:22.78]She said the key was in like this spot.
[97:31.82]It's in the usual hiding spot.
[97:36.13]Of course it is.
[97:36.73]Maybe they took it in the newspaper somewhere.
[97:45.69]It's definitely right fucking here.
[97:47.37]I guarantee it's under the newspaper.
[97:49.09]I guarantee it.
[97:53.38]Who fucking picks shit up like this?
[97:55.36]I can't read this.
[97:56.34]The Daily Press.
[97:57.44]Strange or cold findings in the local woods.
[98:08.90]This game controls like a dirty sock, by the way.
[98:11.61]Not even kidding.
[98:15.03]Like using these buttons to move forward and this one's to turn.
[98:18.13]It's like Resident Evil 7, but awful.
[98:24.10]What was that?
[98:24.90]What was that noise?
[98:28.76]Shit, this is out of battery.
[98:50.50]I charged it all night.
[98:51.64]Oh, god damn it.
[99:05.92]Don't fuck yourself, PlayStation.
[99:11.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK.
[99:19.82]It's got like 9,000 times more awkward, but whatever.
[99:26.29]Key is in the usual spot, honey.
[99:28.15]Let's go.
[99:28.57]Let's find it.
[99:37.57]What's a usual spot?
[99:39.63]I don't know.
[99:40.03]Especially when you give me controls that literally are the worst I've ever experienced.
[99:49.18]Where is it?
[99:51.06]In the usual spot.
[99:53.26]Is it like under the door?
[99:54.72]On top of the door?
[99:56.00]I'm going to run to the battery.
[99:57.46]Behind the pillow?
[100:00.37]If it's behind the pillow, I'm going to be so angry at this game.
[100:06.57]I can't even pick up the pillow.
[100:16.50]Why couldn't the door just be open?
[100:19.38]Like in the plant somewhere?
[100:22.20]I would, like, put it under the plants, right?
[100:26.10]No, no, like, cigarettes.
[100:30.40]Dig through the dirt!
[100:44.50]Is that a key?
[100:47.66]Fuck.
[100:48.81]Give me a fucking break.
[100:51.05]You got...
[100:51.97]Fuck this game.
[100:52.65]I already hate this game.
[100:56.85]I fucking hate this game because of this stupid shit.
[101:01.83]Fuck you.
[101:03.43]Your game sucks.
[101:05.99]I already don't like it.
[101:06.99]I'm going to put it in a random plant.
[101:13.26]It's not like under the newspaper.
[101:14.80]Oh, there's batteries.
[101:15.76]I wonder where they got that idea from.
[101:29.99]course I'm gonna like eat all these words in about 10 seconds not even nobody there okay what about here no that's nothing I can't do anything none of this matters just go
[102:05.25]so yeah I really love like these VR experiences man it's so early the technology's so early that like nobody knows what the to do alright this door doesn't open I don't think yes it does
[102:37.53]I didn't do that.
[102:40.35]Toilet, should I check the toilet seat?
[102:45.97]Let's see what somebody did.
[102:47.19]Oh, you can actually flush the toilet.
[102:53.29]Wow, that's so funny.
[102:54.65]Let's fucking run up there, water bill.
[102:59.33]You're never supposed to do this.
[103:00.09]You're supposed to let, you gotta let the rubber thing reconnect back to the, have you ever looked inside of a toilet before?
[103:04.35]It's pretty fascinating.
[103:10.90]Great.
[103:14.10]This is not going to open.
[103:15.26]OK.
[103:15.90]It's locked.
[103:19.57]Nothing else.
[103:20.09]Atmosphere.
[103:21.33]Got it.
[103:43.26]I'm stuck in the fucking bathroom.
[103:48.21]Open the door!
[103:50.93]Just... Imagine if it was this difficult to get out of a fucking house.
[104:01.73]I can't imagine how hard this would be.
[104:07.80]Just stay open.
[104:12.98]The house is pretty cool.
[104:16.78]Teddy bear.
[104:18.64]Can't open that door.
[104:22.52]It's got like a secret code on it somewhere.
[104:26.18]Like in his ass.
[104:29.64]No, nothing.
[104:37.72]Nothing?
[104:45.78]At least I can take my anger out.
[104:47.80]We're bringing this with us.
[104:50.32]I'm prepared for this shit.
[104:59.48]Why do they have to open it this way?
[105:01.20]What a... What a huge oversight.
[105:05.42]Why do they always have to open... They should all open.
[105:08.68]It should be a unilaterally opening door.
[105:13.49]Okay, get open.
[105:14.88]Go in.
[105:15.36]Thank you very much.
[105:18.72]This one won't open either.
[105:21.00]This needs a key, it seems.
[105:40.44]I'm not... My hand's still there.
[105:42.98]Uh...
[105:44.65]I'm like Plock.
[105:49.13]Thanks Phantom Hand.
[105:53.69]Where am I even facing?
[105:56.61]Oh fuck.
[105:59.64]I need my flashlight right now.
[106:10.16]I made it into a closet.
[106:11.50]Okay, we're doing great work here.
[106:15.77]Can't I go in there?
[106:16.59]Fuck me.
[106:26.37]Let's go.
[106:27.47]I think this way is sufficient.
[106:30.49]This one won't open.
[106:35.79]I was already in here.
[106:39.27]This doesn't open either, does it?
[106:49.24]Something to do with the clock.
[106:50.92]Like, touch the clock.
[106:52.46]Open the clock.
[107:01.95]Wait, should anybody do something with these vases?
[107:13.05]Did I just, did I do that?
[107:32.22]Put the fucking vases down.
[107:33.72]At least one of them.
[107:42.51]What am I supposed to do here?
[107:44.35]Look in the mirror?
[107:47.81]I knew it!
[107:48.67]There's a fucking key right there.
[107:49.91]Give me that key.
[107:53.03]There it is!
[107:55.47]I just forcefully grabbed it a little too hard.
[107:58.29]Just a little too hard.
[108:00.50]Got the key.
[108:03.81]I thought I talked a lot of shit.
[108:10.65]I will continue to talk shit about this though.
[108:35.60]This is more of a hassle than the fucking game.
[108:40.70]Okay, get in there.
[108:42.12]No, open and stay open.
[108:43.34]Stay open.
[108:44.56]Stay open.
[108:45.90]Stay open.
[108:47.68]Don't fucking close.
[108:50.27]Okay.
[108:55.13]Okay.
[109:00.71]Where am I standing?
[109:03.73]Okay, now I have a key.
[109:15.68]That doesn't go in there.
[109:16.86]We've got to find what this goes into.
[109:21.32]Wild stuff we've got going here.
[109:22.76]Wild stuff.
[109:25.54]This is not the key to... Stay open.
[109:29.58]Okay, wait a minute.
[109:35.89]No.
[109:36.75]Of course not.
[109:48.38]Somewhere over here.
[109:52.44]It has to be this.
[109:55.61]What?
[109:56.77]Fuck!
[109:57.99]What?
[110:05.15]There's no other doors to do this to.
[110:09.66]Am I missing something or did I not figure this out?
[110:34.96]Why?
[110:35.70]What?
[110:39.22]It's not that door and it's not this one.
[110:41.18]Have I lost my goddamn mind?
[110:57.59]It's none of these doors.
[111:19.77]Is it like a case?
[111:32.66]Is there like a rusty case that I need to put this in?
[111:34.70]Get the fuck out of here.
[111:39.61]Okay.
[111:48.79]It won't let me leave and no one will help me.
[111:50.99]I just want things to be normal again.
[111:53.29]Granny's room is locked and there are no vents.
[111:59.39]Thanks for the help.
[112:03.00]Alright, I need to... What do you mean the picture?
[112:15.20]The picture is pointing up.
[112:24.25]Pictures pointing up.
[112:43.58]So what?
[112:45.30]What does that mean?
[112:46.08]There's nothing there.
[112:49.08]Do I have to go back outside?
[112:56.01]Oh, it's locked.
[112:56.59]This is locked too.
[113:05.37]I can't open this door.
[113:09.46]Right?
[113:10.42]I can't get this open.
[113:14.62]There's like nothing in here.
[113:20.45]Like the clock doesn't like open.
[113:25.48]I can do that.
[113:26.16]I can do this dumb fucking thing.
[113:27.74]I have to put it, like, at a certain time.
[113:30.33]And once it gets- I think this is fucking seriously freaking me out.
[113:35.01]Like, please.
[113:38.05]Make it- Stop doing that.
[113:40.09]Oh my god, I hate this game.
[113:44.32]Oh, it had to be midnight.
[113:46.24]Wow.
[113:47.66]Oh, ding dong.
[113:48.86]Ding dong, there it is.
[113:49.88]And look, if fucking something came out, a candle-
[114:05.68]Can I move away from this fucking thing?
[114:07.58]Can you please stop?
[114:11.25]I can't even read this.
[114:11.99]It's too blurry.
[114:15.61]27 year old.
[114:16.69]It's too blurry.
[114:17.49]I can't read it.
[114:19.11]Get out of the way.
[114:23.80]It's not even real light.
[114:25.74]It's artificial light.
[114:27.60]Give me the real light.
[114:32.20]I honestly can't read it.
[114:33.30]The PSVR sucks such asshole that I can't read this.
[114:35.98]I have to like push this to my face to read this.
[114:45.05]27 years young, passed away.
[114:51.81]Fucking useless.
[114:59.71]I have a candle now.
[115:00.61]Okay, I gotta place the candle somewhere, right?
[115:09.18]Where's the candle go?
[115:13.44]Cute, cute dog.
[115:19.61]Fucking candle.
[115:20.49]Like, what am I supposed to... I don't even have the candle anymore.
[115:22.51]Where's the candle?
[115:26.81]Where's the candle?
[115:31.15]What happened to the candle?
[115:32.15]Why do I not have the candle anymore?
[115:35.79]My god.
[115:56.16]Eventually it might fucking open.
[115:58.34]If I go far enough away, it might open.
[116:02.88]Let's go down the whole fucking hallway.
[116:10.07]You open yet?
[116:11.87]No.
[116:12.51]Not yet.
[116:13.75]He's getting there.
[116:14.33]Nice job.
[116:15.65]You did it.
[116:25.02]There's like this little hole here, but there's nothing even in there.
[116:34.51]There's nothing here.
[116:35.61]I'm looking to see if there's like fucking like a code.
[116:38.13]Where are the codes?
[116:50.42]What the fuck?
[116:52.64]God damn it.
[116:56.55]Is there anything behind the suits?
[117:00.37]Fucking hell.
[117:06.09]Has anybody figured it out yet?
[117:15.63]Oh God, I hear noises.
[117:19.66]There's nothing behind me.
[117:22.54]I think I forgot the candle.
[117:23.36]What do I do with the fucking candle?
[117:24.56]It's the glass doors.
[117:27.92]There's nothing at the glass doors.
[117:29.13]We already looked.
[117:36.67]Fuck you.
[117:38.03]What's your name?
[117:38.91]Where are you from?
[117:40.29]Who are you?
[117:47.75]Fuck me.
[117:56.18]Is this not gonna open now?
[117:58.18]Of course it's not.
[118:00.48]This is just PT, but awful.
[118:03.38]I'm scared.
[118:04.14]Any codes?
[118:10.46]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[118:11.42]Like when you turn the thing over and it's like $2.91 and there's like a safe.
[118:39.50]I still have a fucking key.
[118:40.34]What does this say?
[118:43.10]Needs batteries.
[118:47.02]Is this poop?
[118:48.80]Poof.
[118:53.99]Need food.
[118:57.55]How long have I been in this fucking game for?
[119:01.21]Is this, do I, am I supposed to just not, like, just fail everything and there's, like, a person that could be here, right?
[119:08.68]I apparently don't have the candle anymore.
[119:20.90]Can I open this door now?
[119:21.76]No.
[119:29.00]Look out.
[119:38.66]It's just a game where you walk around in circles and look at stuff and then somebody scares you.
[119:54.60]You're not supposed to open any of these things.
[119:56.14]You're just supposed to literally walk around aimlessly.
[119:59.80]Oh look, this is open now.
[120:00.84]Look, there's batteries in here.
[120:01.92]Thanks for the batteries.
[120:02.54]Thanks for the batteries.
[120:11.24]Jesus Christ.
[120:21.70]Keyholes here.
[120:37.56]I'm currently trying to take batteries out of this.
[120:40.22]Could you please give me a minute?
[120:43.10]Give me a moment, please.
[120:44.04]I'm very slowly and terribly opening every single one of these.
[120:55.71]I can't get this one here.
[121:08.10]in VR, man, I swear to God.
[121:12.58]Nothing in there!
[121:22.95]It becomes more like random jump scares.
[121:24.47]I'm about to go to the next game here in a minute.
[121:33.99]Of course.
[121:37.56]Yeah, I can hear you, look up.
[121:40.46]She's gonna run in front of the camera and grab me and shit, and then I'm gonna just get out of the game.
[121:43.96]Yeah, see, fuck it, I told you.
[121:47.00]And now we're back at square one.
[121:49.53]We get to be back at square one, guys.
[121:50.85]You get to stay in the room.
[121:54.53]Oh, thank God.
[121:57.59]I'll smash her head with this.
[122:00.05]You wanna try to, like, come at me?
[122:03.07]This thing's made out, I don't know if it was made out of clay.
[122:12.64]Huh?
[122:13.80]Who the fuck was that?
[122:16.60]Who was that?
[122:18.04]What?
[122:19.28]Hey, just wanted to let you know this thing's after me.
[122:24.25]Okay.
[122:27.67]Whatever you say.
[122:30.23]Left you a social studies book here.
[122:40.26]Can I open this?
[122:47.16]Is that a candle?
[122:47.74]Am I supposed to touch this?
[122:52.98]Okay, well, I guess I might need to know this for later.
[123:03.35]Can I just draw my own pictures in here?
[123:04.79]Let's go upstairs.
[123:18.92]No, I would have liked it if you had started with this.
[123:22.35]Fucking holy shit!
[123:49.45]Jesus Christ.
[123:50.59]Come on.
[123:53.57]Just have my fucking life flash before my eyes.
[123:55.59]I can hear something behind me already.
[124:00.77]Give me my wands.
[124:07.12]Wait, have I got the right answer?
[124:20.40]I don't have any weapons.
[124:32.97]Okay.
[124:37.11]Don't open.
[124:42.93]What's going on?
[125:04.86]It's a really odd-looking tricycle.
[125:06.48]I'm so scared now.
[125:07.74]Like, all the... It's fucking PT.
[125:20.92]I have to, like, open all these painstakingly.
[125:22.82]Alright, so you ready?
[125:25.94]One, two, three, code.
[125:27.94]Yup.
[125:28.82]What is that?
[125:35.85]I hear something in the room.
[125:36.67]Who's in the room?
[125:39.53]No, I don't.
[125:43.03]Okay, so I need a candle, picture, a little, like, figurine, question mark, jar.
[125:52.29]You got it.
[125:56.19]Sure thing.
[125:58.49]Are my hands, like, bloody?
[125:59.49]No.
[126:01.05]Oh, all the pictures are gone.
[126:01.97]Except for that one.
[126:05.26]Okay, let's go.
[126:06.06]I want to open up these things.
[126:10.66]More fucking notes.
[126:11.42]I can't read it.
[126:28.44]I actually want to be able to read this.
[126:30.12]Push this forward.
[126:36.14]PSVR is so blurry.
[126:38.54]I'm so sorry we didn't make it to your barbecue.
[126:40.52]I'm not supposed to read that then, apparently.
[126:50.16]What the fuck?
[127:41.65]Open the door, come on.
[127:49.06]Open the door.
[127:57.84]Why won't the door open?
[128:12.22]I don't understand.
[128:13.06]It won't open.
[128:13.64]I have no idea.
[128:20.89]Last try.
[128:31.07]Fucking open the door, dude!
[128:40.45]Zbopo the Clown!
[128:47.47]I got him.
[128:47.83]Fucking clown.
[129:11.31]Shut it off.
[129:11.93]Shut it off.
[129:13.04]Shut it off.
[129:14.64]Shut it off!
[129:18.00]Shut it off!
[129:23.26]Stop it!
[129:24.88]Stop this music!
[129:28.21]Oh shi- I thought he was singing.
[129:31.87]Fuck you, buddy!
[129:46.01]I don't think he liked that very much.
[129:47.49]No codes?
[130:16.69]I almost got it.
[130:31.72]Daddy always gives me the coolest stuff.
[130:33.67]He's the best.
[130:36.73]Of course I do.
[130:38.93]Chuck.
[130:47.74]Dance dance revolution, huh?
[130:53.68]High score!
[130:56.87]There's like a spider in there.
[131:19.38]Thought I fucking heard something.
[131:29.15]Just waiting for that fucking clown to turn around and do something insane.
[131:36.08]Opening doors in this game is like a painful experience.
[131:45.06]Well, OK, there's a way to go down there.
[131:47.08]Something's going to jump in here.
[131:48.26]There's going to be something fucked up.
[131:54.27]Can I go through this?
[131:56.93]Just the other closet.
[132:03.67]What's the point of any of this shit?
[132:11.01]Of course not.
[132:21.78]Did this open?
[132:22.64]Wait, did I open this?
[132:24.71]No, I didn't.
[132:40.94]Wait, hold on.
[132:41.68]I'll get it in a second.
[132:42.42]Just wait.
[132:43.82]It's the fucking shitty VR controls.
[132:45.56]Don't wait.
[132:46.06]God damn it.
[132:52.46]Blake.
[132:56.34]We got a baseball, guys.
[132:58.33]Cool.
[133:01.71]I thought I said I could run.
[133:06.08]Behind me.
[133:22.51]Into the living room.
[133:31.59]Oh, is that me?
[133:32.39]No.
[133:34.00]Okay, well she knocks over the table and shit.
[133:37.38]Yeah, this is the same room, right?
[133:41.22]Donkey filth, yup, okay.
[133:49.17]You have to do that, like seriously.
[133:53.00]Guess what, lady?
[133:56.10]Strike three, you're out.
[134:14.13]That was a miserable failure.
[134:23.69]Stand, recalibrate.
[134:25.47]Turn, pick up note.
[134:28.85]Daddy says that I'm too old to have imaginary friends.
[134:32.91]I told that he is real and he's not my friend anymore.
[134:39.28]This is where the thing fell down.
[134:56.02]Is it the girl?
[134:58.96]No, that's like... Now that this lady's coming for me, how do I sprint again?
[135:03.95]Is she behind me?
[135:06.09]Is she right in front of me?
[135:07.03]I can't tell the difference.
[135:08.21]Let's just hop this way and forget it.
[135:09.77]I can't see very well.
[135:12.21]She's behind me.
[135:12.97]She is behind me.
[135:13.71]Turn the flash... I don't have any batteries.
[135:15.90]Turn the flashlight on.
[135:16.60]I don't...
[135:36.16]I'm holding this in my fucking hand.
[135:41.45]Damn it.
[135:48.95]Where the hell was that?
[135:50.43]It was down here, right?
[135:54.77]Yeah.
[135:55.41]Okay, so I gotta be ready to, like, shove this in there.
[135:59.00]The door?
[135:59.46]Maybe I should go in the door that opens.
[136:03.26]See if I can go.
[136:04.04]Go, go, go.
[136:11.34]Huh?
[136:11.46]But, like, it's dark.
[136:13.44]What the fuck?
[136:14.18]Where am I?
[136:14.78]Flashlight on, please.
[136:22.42]I can't turn the flashlight on.
[136:23.44]For the love of God.
[136:30.51]But where the fuck is she, then?
[136:40.69]Apparently a flashlight doesn't work in hell.
[136:48.49]She's gonna, I'm gonna run right into her.
[136:51.51]Must you, must you do this.
[136:52.95]Must you, must you.
[137:13.83]Fucking asshole.
[137:17.98]Is that Boppo the Clown throwing shit at me?
[137:23.10]It is.
[137:23.32]You dicks, you dicks.
[138:00.80]Fuck me.
[138:05.28]Ay-yi-yi.
[138:14.82]Oh, I hate this haunted house shit.
[138:20.42]What is this?
[138:31.48]How is this paranormal activity, by the way?
[138:38.39]Why the fuck do you have to be so loud?
[138:41.55]I get it, you're a scary movie.
[138:44.97]Did a new one come out recently or what?
[139:02.95]You're gonna make a joke.
[139:04.25]I gotta make a joke.
[139:05.71]Come on.
[139:06.81]I gotta make a stupid joke.
[139:08.27]Give me the ball.
[139:09.87]Give me the ball.
[139:13.81]I can't get the ball.
[139:14.97]Fuck.
[139:16.46]Give me the ashtray.
[139:17.66]Give me a knife.
[139:18.54]Give me the flask.
[139:19.56]Got it.
[139:23.30]Choose your path.
[139:27.34]Well, I'd love to choose my path.
[139:28.40]I can't see my path.
[139:48.79]Whoa!
[139:49.87]I'm just trying to get my beer.
[139:52.93]I'm just trying to get my beer.
[139:54.25]I just want to get my drink.
[140:00.25]Jesus.
[140:00.73]Is that the right?
[140:10.15]Is that on this fucking desk?
[140:23.81]You damn thing.
[140:24.61]Oh my god, why?
[140:28.62]Why does the flashlight even exist?
[140:30.08]There's no... Is the bulb gone?
[140:32.08]I don't understand why.
[140:33.02]I just gotta drink a liquid courage.
[140:54.24]What?
[140:54.64]Floor is falling?
[141:00.70]Which one do I want to take?
[141:02.81]Left or right?
[141:05.33]Well, I better decide because otherwise this whole thing... What is that?
[141:11.71]Is that a shoe?
[141:13.57]Do I want the shoe?
[141:14.47]What do I want?
[141:17.31]I don't know what's over here.
[141:20.31]Well, we're taking the shoe.
[141:21.45]We're taking the shoe apparently.
[141:23.52]Oh, no, I need that.
[141:24.28]I need that bat.
[141:27.89]That joke is over.
[141:29.17]Give me the... There we go.
[141:29.99]That's what I'm talking about.
[141:30.77]A fucking knife.
[141:32.61]Smash this into somebody's head.
[141:46.21]Where'd my knife go?
[141:54.02]Oh, great.
[142:03.24]OK.
[142:04.02]Oh, it's DDR.
[142:25.41]Funny.
[142:29.27]Something else in here, right?
[142:34.92]Fucking hearing stuff, I swear to God.
[142:45.51]Alright, guys, they gotta work on the door opening.
[142:47.45]They really do.
[142:48.01]That's one thing that VR is gonna die because of.
[142:51.68]Nobody can figure out how to get somebody to open a fucking door with their hand.
[143:00.43]Is that a fucking dog or is that a person?
[143:21.23]That's fine.
[143:22.75]We're okay.
[143:24.57]I can sprint.
[143:25.43]That means that there's a scary lady in the house now.
[143:30.96]Should I go downstairs?
[143:31.90]This is open now.
[143:37.43]My escape route is downstairs.
[143:46.66]Oh, fuck you.
[143:47.52]I knew it.
[143:47.88]It's got to run down the stairs.
[143:48.80]Down the stairs, gentlemen.
[143:50.70]Ladies and gentlemen, down the stairs.
[143:52.00]I see a little light up there.
[143:53.10]I can't see.
[144:02.67]It's blurry.
[144:09.51]This one?
[144:11.46]Not that one.
[144:18.39]Battery she went in here What's that what is this she went in there she went inside of that thing clock midnight Nevermind that's not gonna work This is just a this is a game it's time just it's time to run I
[144:56.34]What the hell?
[145:04.48]How do I get out of here?
[145:12.73]Back in the day, they called these cassette tapes.
[145:15.53]You'd use them with the tape recorder I gave you.
[145:17.45]Record every day and enjoy.
[145:18.99]You're all dead.
[145:27.19]The whole thing's being recorded.
[145:32.22]What am I supposed to do?
[145:33.94]That's what I just tried to do, like down here.
[145:35.44]Wait, right?
[145:43.65]Like this is where she went.
[145:57.71]Okay, I'm just like spinning the globe now.
[145:59.47]I'm not like making any progress.
[146:07.65]What is the guy, Aerodynamics?
[146:12.58]Aaron Hubbard, isn't that the guy that made Scientology?
[146:17.24]Oh boy, whoa, there's the cassette.
[146:29.83]What does this say?
[146:30.41]What the hell does this say?
[146:32.66]Flames, flames, and the fire.
[146:33.96]Play the tape for fire.
[146:36.88]Okay.
[146:37.90]I'll try.
[146:38.44]Oh, I got it.
[146:46.90]I got something.
[146:49.04]That's great.
[146:49.47]I need to put this in here.
[146:50.39]Okay.
[146:53.25]Play.
[146:54.57]Oh, shit.
[147:06.84]Reception's a little poor.
[147:17.83]This is where we get fire.
[147:18.83]Downstairs?
[147:26.09]Do I have to listen to this whole fucking tape?
[147:36.42]No, it's just to turn the TV on.
[147:37.79]Okay.
[147:44.27]So what of it?
[147:44.79]Am I on TV?
[147:48.86]No.
[147:52.50]Whatever.
[147:53.44]Start the fire.
[147:54.04]I'm assuming the fireplace is like down in the living room, right?
[148:05.28]This is a, no, that's like, what's on my hand?
[148:07.20]What happened to me?
[148:09.04]Why do I have like a fucking implant?
[148:10.79]I have like an augmentation now.
[148:22.17]I have like an Intel like I-fucking-three implanted into my hand.
[148:41.55]Wasn't I already in here?
[148:43.94]I was.
[148:48.00]Where's this fire that they speak of?
[148:52.68]It might be time to relax and play a frog game.
[148:55.44]I think so.
[148:59.59]I've been doing this VR fucking horror shit for like two to three hours now.
[149:05.75]I think my body needs a break.
[149:21.24]Haven't been in here.
[149:25.44]What about you?
[149:27.34]There's too much stuff, the room is a mess.
[149:29.30]I can't do anything in here.
[149:31.99]All we can do is look.
[149:37.13]Give it to me, I want the bear.
[149:39.29]Oh well.
[149:44.85]Teddy.
[149:46.87]Teddy!
[149:51.24]Well, I don't see a reason to stay.
[149:56.74]Shit.
[150:02.16]I can't even go over here.
[150:03.06]Let's just fucking get out of here.
[150:05.52]What is that key for?
[150:06.40]This is where that lady was.
[150:16.13]One of those opens.
[150:24.41]Let's hold on to that.
[150:32.49]Sounds good to me.
[150:39.34]Fix that.
[150:41.70]I can't.
[150:43.72]I tried to fix it.
[150:49.70]I'm going to rip this cord out.
[151:00.02]I was like, I'm going to get some fucking VR games.
[151:02.71]It'll be like funny fun VR night.
[151:04.77]And now I'm just terrified, just shitting my pants.
[151:07.71]It's been like a horror night.
[151:08.91]We didn't even play the frog game yet.
[151:12.11]We're going to be ending this very soon.
[151:22.49]We're moving on to the frog game.
[151:28.41]This game is pretty cool though.
[151:30.79]It has stepped up from being gone home to being scary.
[151:43.33]I'm sweaty.
[151:45.30]I'm the sweatiest person I know right now.
[151:54.44]Where's that fire supposed to be?
[151:55.84]Okay, this door opens.
[152:01.48]I wish there was, like, a side step.
[152:16.49]Open.
[152:20.17]What's with these doors that, like, sometimes just don't do anything?
[152:22.33]Just very clearly, like, just open the fucking door.
[152:28.54]We need to learn how to do this, Jevs.
[152:31.24]Game development needs to figure out the door push open mechanic.
[152:34.32]This is the bathroom.
[152:38.32]It's all coming full circle.
[152:44.71]Okay, well.
[152:49.47]This is fun.
[152:49.99]What was that?
[152:57.89]I was supposed to make a fucking rhino joke.
[153:00.99]Uh, alright, yeah, it's time to move on.
[153:07.28]As, like, interesting as this is, I want to try the other games that I got.
[153:10.06]And the fucking, this is, hold on, now we gotta open this door.
[153:14.00]It's to this door.
[153:15.12]This is a random ass fucking door.
[153:16.98]Kitchen.
[153:18.55]What do they got for cereal?
[153:19.29]This is important.
[153:26.51]Oats.
[153:28.33]Champion's breakfast.
[153:29.43]Oats.
[153:32.06]Anything left?
[153:33.54]There's nothing even left.
[153:38.55]Party size.
[153:43.65]Cutlass fish.
[153:45.43]Cuttlefish crisps.
[153:48.41]That's fucking disgusting.
[153:50.58]What is that?
[153:51.18]Nothing.
[153:53.34]Let's go through the zone and then I'm going to take another break and we'll come back and play the other ones.
[153:59.50]But I am going to hold on to this fucking frying pan because that's a deadly weapon.
[154:07.57]Let's just keep moving.
[154:09.53]Can the fridge be opened?
[154:12.42]Come on.
[154:13.00]That's bullshit.
[154:13.58]You should be able to open the fridge.
[154:18.88]I don't know why I thought that was going to open the door.
[154:29.62]There's the fire.
[154:32.98]That's the whole reason we came down here is for this.
[154:35.79]So what does that do?
[154:40.55]Candles.
[154:50.66]That fire looks real bad, by the way.
[154:53.36]Let's make up some bacon and eggs.
[154:55.40]I can't even do it.
[155:06.71]So what's the point of this?
[155:09.19]Doesn't seem to do much.
[155:12.29]Oh well.
[155:14.91]Well, it's time to move on.
[155:16.07]It's time to next this thing.
[155:19.43]Let's try to just shatter the glass and then we'll move on.
[155:25.91]Oh, it just goes through.
[155:28.40]Will it drop in the other room?
[155:31.76]Yep.
[155:35.09]Now I can't get it back.
[155:36.55]Alright, let's go to the next thing.
[155:37.77]We gotta, like, figure this out first.
[155:46.66]If I didn't have, like, three other games I wanted to get to.
[155:52.27]Play the tape at the fire.
[155:53.37]Alright, we'll do that.
[155:54.07]I'm gonna do that and that's it.
[155:55.09]I'm gonna play the tape at the fire.
[155:59.15]Let's see what happens.
[155:59.63]This is the last chance.
[156:04.54]And I'm gonna go cry because I'm gonna go bald in the front of my head because this is literally ripping the hairs out of the front of my head.
[156:09.29]Alright, let's play this tape right here at the fire.
[156:13.71]Alright, there it is.
[156:14.37]Alright, let's go.
[156:14.85]This is it.
[156:16.07]Last shot.
[156:17.50]No scares.
[156:31.97]Whoa, excuse me.
[156:33.81]I thought I just did that.
[156:35.45]Is my flashlight gone?
[156:50.22]Well, that's not fucked up at all.
[156:53.26]Alright, it's alright.
[156:54.24]I got batteries.
[156:58.00]Shit in my pants.
[156:58.98]What are you thinking here?
[157:00.72]Grab this.
[157:01.84]Touch this.
[157:03.20]Grab the candle.
[157:04.54]No.
[157:05.02]Stand in a circle.
[157:06.35]Oh, Lord.
[157:08.15]Alright, like, sacrifice me.
[157:10.99]Whatever the fuck you're gonna do.
[157:11.89]Just do it.
[157:12.55]Apparently you're not gonna do it.
[157:24.27]I'm not reading that out loud.
[157:25.53]Are you kidding me?
[157:26.55]I've seen plenty of horror movies to not read that out loud.
[157:32.03]Is this.
[157:36.03]This goes right in the middle.
[157:37.39]Right there.
[157:39.59]Say that you need like a sacrifice.
[157:41.03]That's like an old king's amulet.
[157:46.18]I need like the skull.
[157:48.56]Right.
[157:52.40]No.
[157:55.40]Fucking hair.
[158:00.71]Hey, you want, like, 8% less hair?
[158:02.58]Wear the PSVR helmet.
[158:07.50]I really need, like, a second here.
[158:08.64]This is fucking killing me.
[158:13.98]Like, they couldn't have made a more uncomfortable fucking helmet.
[158:17.26]It just, like, squishes and presses into your fucking forehead.
[158:20.40]Like, hey, Sony!
[158:23.78]What's the fastest way to rip hairs out of somebody's fucking forehead?
[158:27.92]I know!
[158:30.53]Hey, can we make the thing with cheap fucking plastic?
[158:33.65]Yeah, we can.
[158:35.13]Sell it for fucking $400?
[158:36.21]Yeah, it takes like 80 bucks to make one.
[158:42.10]Fucking assholes.
[158:42.86]Just as long as it's fucking cheap.
[158:52.80]Sir, I mean, some people might be uncomfortable.
[158:55.16]Shut the fuck up.
[158:56.58]You understand?
[158:58.06]As long as we make it for like $40 and sell it for $400.
[159:02.73]That's all I fucking care about.
[159:05.31]I'm a piece of shit executive.
[159:09.87]Okay, what was I doing?
[159:13.59]What happened?
[159:15.07]We got more gold coins?
[159:18.47]There's so many of these.
[159:19.63]Well, I don't need these.
[159:29.62]Can I go under here?
[159:30.46]I guess I can sneak this way.
[159:33.40]Where are these fucking coins?
[159:37.55]That's a wall.
[159:45.15]What is this?
[159:47.59]This is like a Goosebumps newsletter.
[159:49.63]Oh my fucking god.
[160:00.37]Alright.
[160:02.63]This was interesting.
[160:03.37]This is cool.
[160:04.59]I stood in the middle of the sonogram, whatever, the pentagram, whatever, the isotope.
[160:14.34]Okay, cool.
[160:15.50]Let's play the next one.
[160:20.28]It's the book.
[160:21.06]I don't even care.
[160:24.37]Read a book.
[160:24.83]I don't want to read a book.
[160:26.69]I don't like it.
[160:30.87]God.
[160:32.43]Fucking Sony executives.
[160:37.11]What is a Sony executive want?
[160:39.11]First feed the flame.
[160:41.30]The light will guide you and he shall be born again.
[160:45.56]Place the coins.
[160:46.74]Oh, God.
[161:05.89]I'm fucking just trying to pray with these hands.
[161:11.93]So I gotta put the coins in the corners.
[161:14.59]Okay.
[161:16.99]Sounds like fun.
[161:23.85]Am I doing this right?
[161:27.63]Just drop the little wafer onto the little tart machine there.
[161:30.70]Okay, cool.
[161:33.05]There's another coin line around here somewhere.
[161:34.91]There it is.
[161:35.41]Good luck picking it up.
[161:53.76]I don't think this is right.
[161:54.94]I don't even care.
[161:57.84]I don't even fucking care.
[162:00.04]I don't even think I'm doing this right.
[162:03.75]Place the coins.
[162:05.35]I... No, fuck!
[162:08.50]No, that's right, right?
[162:16.68]Close enough.
[162:18.21]Where was that other coin?
[162:19.09]Did I throw it across the room?
[162:24.37]I gotta, like, burn this guy.
[162:27.27]Come here.
[162:29.78]Yeah, I need you.
[162:34.54]This is why the stupid fucking PlayStation Eye camera is not good enough.
[162:40.90]It's not capable of being able to get down.
[162:45.19]It just isn't.
[162:46.01]It doesn't matter where it is.
[162:47.05]It's sitting right there, and it has to be there.
[162:49.61]This one fucking piece of shit is not capable of me doing this.
[162:54.63]There needs to be another device over there, like down here.
[162:58.48]It's just not capable.
[163:00.04]It's incapable.
[163:01.64]It's solely incapable.
[163:05.80]It's just an incapable piece of hardware.
[163:08.54]Burn it.
[163:13.19]Something fell out.
[163:13.85]Hold on.
[163:21.23]Oh.
[163:32.52]That's what I thought it was...
[163:39.26]Pick him up.
[163:47.33]It's incapable.
[163:48.67]It's an incapable device.
[163:51.05]It's not meant to do this.
[163:52.23]Get out of here.
[164:22.26]Get it.
[164:22.64]I can't move.
[164:32.09]I can't move.
[164:32.59]I'm in a dangerous situation here, for real.
[164:35.27]This is dangerous.
[164:37.75]I'm doing something dangerous.
[164:39.57]I got to get off this chair.
[164:47.23]I got it.
[164:48.47]I got it.
[164:49.15]OK, where does it go?
[164:58.23]Get out!
[165:05.12]Where am I?
[165:10.98]Okay, I'm good.
[165:13.14]We're good.
[165:15.62]What?
[165:20.08]What are you talking about?
[165:22.76]What do you mean?
[165:25.26]Huh?
[165:35.06]Wait, they have to be down... This is the board game.
[165:42.38]I thought the fucking board game... The board game over here reflects what's happening down there.
[165:47.87]See, they're down there already, but the board game... Get out of the way.
[165:59.71]I got...
[166:08.48]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[166:09.62]So only one is correct.
[166:15.18]Which one's correct?
[166:21.84]You stay right there.
[166:31.77]Like, do I have to like heat it up like it's fucking crack?
[166:37.07]I don't understand.
[166:52.72]I can't touch it.
[166:53.66]I'm going over here for a second.
[167:07.29]Shit!
[167:10.73]Where is it?
[167:11.59]Fuck!
[167:15.85]No, don't play the stupid sounds!
[167:18.78]Shut up!
[167:41.63]This is fucking madness.
[167:43.21]I thought I was doing the right thing.
[167:47.02]I was just over-complicating the whole damn thing from the very beginning.
[167:52.36]This one's lit up like blue and shit.
[167:55.37]Is that in the right place?
[168:22.88]I hate it.
[168:23.54]This is only horizontal.
[168:28.58]That's how you get like this, Sony, when you have a horizontal plane only.
[168:31.98]This thing essentially is a fucking Wii sensor bar.
[168:50.93]What the fuck am I talking about?
[168:52.49]Did I win?
[168:52.93]Did I fucking get Monopoly?
[169:18.97]I'm trying to like... I'm trying to go beyond what the game wants me to do.
[169:26.70]Go ahead, take it.
[169:28.78]Take your fucking little vanilla wafers and shove them up your ass.
[169:34.97]Get on there.
[169:49.22]This chair had to wait.
[169:57.53]Oh shit, I'm gonna fucking rip cords out.
[169:59.43]Don't do that.
[170:06.13]I need like that symbol.
[170:09.01]But I don't know where the fuck that is.
[170:10.33]Fucking swear to God.
[170:21.60]Hey, who remembers me playing fucking Batman?
[170:26.32]Same shit.
[170:27.88]Horizontal plane only.
[170:30.52]Fuck you.
[170:32.52]Not you guys, like fuck you game and fuck you Sony.
[170:36.71]Where's that last coin that I like threw probably like 30 minutes ago into the wall?
[170:45.71]I think I threw it into the wall over here, didn't I?
[170:48.99]I did, didn't I?
[170:49.59]There it is.
[170:53.05]Where is it?
[170:53.37]Blink again for me.
[170:54.03]Come on.
[170:56.47]Oh, this is going to be a fucking nightmare.
[171:08.28]Oh my god.
[171:13.44]This is fucking painful.
[171:14.62]It just is.
[171:17.00]I can't wait.
[171:18.71]I'm going to burn my PSVR.
[171:21.85]You know what I mean?
[171:23.50]I'm gonna fucking throw it in a dumpster fire.
[171:26.62]I'm gonna get in my backyard and just make up.
[171:29.24]I'm gonna put all the shit that I don't like into one of those barrels.
[171:33.20]I'm gonna piss on it, too.
[171:46.53]Like, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[171:50.52]Like, why?
[171:52.22]I've said this has been calibrated like fucking a thousand times.
[171:55.93]It shouldn't be this hard to go this low.
[172:05.89]It shouldn't be that difficult to put your hands like that.
[172:08.23]Oh, look at magic, magic, blue magic.
[172:15.98]Where's the last one?
[172:16.76]Get the fuck over there.
[172:18.82]Good, yeah.
[172:19.46]Okay.
[172:20.00]Yahtzee!
[172:20.80]Good, got it!
[172:27.04]Where is he?
[172:27.78]Where's the devil?
[172:28.32]I just, like, fucking summoned him.
[172:42.75]I'll be right back.
[172:43.61]I gotta fucking- I gotta get, like, a drink at BRB.
[174:09.48]Alright.
[174:19.61]Fucking insanity.
[174:20.71]Alright, we're coming back.
[174:27.31]Yes, I'd like to close Paranormal Activity.
[174:31.37]Let's just fucking hang out for like another few minutes.
[174:34.53]I got two more games I want to play before I gotta take a break.
[174:40.30]Get it on here.
[174:40.90]I look like a fucking serial murderer, by the way.
[174:45.16]We're just gonna relax and we're gonna play the game about a frog.
[174:50.18]This is just a frog game.
[174:51.40]This is not like insanity.
[174:56.62]Fucking goddammit.
[175:00.51]Oh, you see what happened to my hair?
[175:03.57]Look at this.
[175:04.07]It was so golden and luxurious.
[175:07.08]And now it's like dead.
[175:09.04]It's dead.
[175:09.56]I'm gonna have to like shave my head.
[175:11.02]I'm gonna have to take like a, I'm gonna have to like condition, I'm gonna have to do like a treatment to my hair tonight.
[175:26.66]First, let me just fucking, I gotta get rid of this.
[175:37.24]I need to buy a Vive.
[175:38.36]What the fuck am I doing?
[175:40.62]I swear to God, every time, every time we play VPS VR, it's like, sometimes it's fucking kind of fun.
[175:47.95]Sometimes it's cool, right?
[175:49.67]Some games are cool.
[175:50.33]Resident Evil 7 was fucking awesome.
[175:52.03]It was.
[175:52.33]I don't know if it was Capcom or whoever was involved.
[175:56.65]But Resident Evil 7 in PSVR was wonderful.
[176:00.27]It was fucking awesome.
[176:01.13]It was scary.
[176:01.70]It was fun.
[176:03.00]But for the most part, man, I just got to get a 5 and set it up.
[176:06.26]Because you get the four corners right.
[176:08.18]You get the horizontal plane.
[176:09.26]You get the bottom level.
[176:10.44]It's just so much better than this fucking Toys R Us toy.
[176:14.40]It's a goddamn toy.
[176:19.04]It's like, do you want VR or do you want a toy?
[176:30.89]It's not.
[176:31.43]It's not a toy.
[176:32.61]It's a toy.
[176:33.87]This is a toy.
[176:40.41]Vibe confirmed.
[176:41.25]I'm buying a Vive tonight.
[176:42.93]No, I'm not.
[176:43.35]I don't have any, like, money.
[176:44.65]I need to, like, slow down with my purchases.
[176:49.95]Look, this is just what I'm talking about.
[176:53.21]You can see, like, the funny frog face.
[176:54.85]This is arcade.
[176:57.67]Look it.
[177:01.09]Does my mouth move when I talk?
[177:03.81]It does.
[177:04.09]Hold on.
[177:04.39]This is fucking game of the night right here.
[177:14.39]Frog.
[177:15.87]Game of the fucking evening.
[177:18.72]Unbelievable.
[177:19.20]This is fucking perfect.
[177:19.98]Here we go.
[177:24.00]Hey!
[177:24.90]It's me!
[177:26.04]It's me, Mr. Frog!
[177:28.44]It's not doing it.
[177:40.21]How to frog.
[177:45.50]It's a terrible explanation.
[177:46.74]I don't understand.
[177:49.06]It's a what's it.
[177:50.88]Okay, so you shoot lily pads.
[177:53.44]Pad.
[177:54.83]Puke.
[177:56.43]Time.
[177:58.25]Limit.
[177:59.81]Push it to the limit.
[178:00.77]Let's go.
[178:18.87]What am I sticking my tongue out for?
[178:20.63]I need the controller, and the controller has no battery.
[178:23.05]Wait.
[178:24.94]Oh my god.
[178:26.36]Reach 5,000 points.
[178:27.32]How do I do it?
[178:28.98]I don't think I have to...
[179:03.53]Oh, I'm like drunk.
[179:11.31]Alright, I don't even need to look at the chat to know what you guys are saying.
[179:14.26]Yeah, I understand the game is awful.
[179:16.58]I get it, but like, come on, give me a break.
[179:21.68]If you had like a six-year-old little brother, he would love it.
[179:31.74]It's so simple and easy, it's just like family fun, you know what I mean?
[179:41.21]Oh boy.
[179:51.75]Boss fight.
[179:53.67]Boss fight!
[179:55.91]Boss fight!
[179:57.33]Boss fight!
[179:59.71]Boss fight!
[180:18.44]Okay.
[180:23.60]We're gonna play Doom, but the guy was like having trouble when he did the two O's and the R. Doom!
[180:33.43]Get ready for Doom!
[180:43.43]Huh?
[180:45.53]What the fuck is going on?
[180:46.99]What am I looking at here?
[180:49.72]Control setup.
[180:50.82]Oh, this is fucking ugly.
[180:55.03]Press the move button on the motion controller.
[180:56.77]Like, what are you talking about?
[180:57.65]I had to do... Okay, we got both.
[181:03.13]This is very bare bones.
[181:06.27]Okay, press the move button on your right controller to continue.
[181:09.03]Press X button to play with wireless controller.
[181:14.31]Hey, this is how you play!
[181:15.67]Okay, so fire.
[181:18.39]Teleport.
[181:21.15]Inventory.
[181:22.45]Rotate.
[181:23.67]Rotate.
[181:35.90]Look here to continue.
[181:36.68]Be careful with your surroundings.
[181:37.78]Make sure you have enough space to play.
[181:39.96]If you are standing, avoid turning around.
[181:46.29]Why is it like this is not correct?
[181:49.17]Press fire to start.
[181:52.27]Loading.
[181:52.75]This is like a Flash game from like 1998.
[181:55.17]Okay.
[182:02.64]Demo mode, survival, play, info, settings.
[182:07.08]Let's just go to settings.
[182:08.18]Dash, blink, gameplay.
[182:11.07]Small turn, 30 degrees, big turn, 100, whatever.
[182:16.11]No mission selected.
[182:16.93]That's fine.
[182:17.27]We're going to go to the...
[182:19.53]Argendnor Survival.
[182:23.52]This one's easy.
[182:24.90]Simple survival in Argendnor.
[182:26.80]Easy mode.
[182:27.32]Kill all the enemies.
[182:31.42]Alright, here we go.
[182:41.27]Oh, it's one of these games where you like dash around and they teleport around and shit.
[182:45.87]How do I shoot the gun?
[182:48.79]Do I not have any guns?
[182:55.39]Do I have to fucking punch this guy?
[182:58.17]Whoa!
[183:01.55]Where are the weapons?
[183:03.79]Huh?
[183:04.27]Pistol.
[183:05.41]What?
[183:07.01]What?
[183:09.37]Oh, dear.
[183:16.81]This is as loud as it could...
[183:22.68]That's the loudest game I've ever had in my ear.
[183:26.14]Okay.
[183:26.78]Empty pistol.
[183:27.78]Spell wand.
[183:29.16]Plasma sword.
[183:33.46]Jesus Christ.
[183:39.45]Okay.
[183:43.59]This game just got that much fucking more cool.
[183:48.75]Why would you use the pistol?
[183:50.27]Ever.
[183:50.93]Never.
[183:52.88]There's no reason to use the pistol.
[183:54.60]I'm just gonna hold this out like this, and just have to spell one.
[183:59.28]And I'm not gonna move.
[184:07.18]This is, this is, this is, I like it.
[184:12.41]Lance with the fire.
[184:16.87]Oh shit, they have guns!
[184:20.93]Since when do you have a gun?
[184:38.19]I gotta go this way.
[184:39.85]That was fucking ridiculous.
[184:44.54]Fuck!
[184:53.30]Oh, fuck my head!
[185:09.66]This is harder than it looks.
[185:12.34]I can assure you.
[185:16.33]Come here.
[185:17.67]Come here.
[185:24.03]Do you have any other guns?
[185:38.63]Oh, wow.
[185:39.13]This game's not fun.
[185:44.67]Okay.
[185:45.89]We got it.
[185:46.79]We're here.
[185:47.49]Here we are.
[185:48.17]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!
[185:49.41]You know what I'm saying?
[185:52.35]I got a better idea.
[186:05.52]Foolproof.
[186:21.30]Easy!
[186:24.16]Who's left?
[186:24.52]Okay.
[186:33.23]Another wave?
[186:33.63]That's so fucking stupid.
[186:42.03]Okay, uh...
[186:52.44]Why would I do that?
[187:00.06]I'm just like, I'm cutting.
[187:01.22]I'm like, I'm using this as a cutting board.
[187:14.87]Can I like block bullets?
[187:15.85]Like fucking Luke Skywalker?
[187:16.98]Oh, I can!
[187:25.28]Just like fucking Star Wars, man.
[187:26.64]Watch this.
[187:33.38]Use the force, Luke!
[187:34.32]I think I ran into this.
[187:44.97]Why is this not working?
[187:54.64]Okay, that, like, Master Chief over there has a machine gun.
[187:58.78]I need to probably, I need to get, like, in a better spot.
[188:00.90]Right here in the corner.
[188:01.54]Oh, whoops!
[188:11.59]Highly intelligent enemies.
[188:15.72]Hey!
[188:16.84]Watch out for that fucking Master Chief!
[188:18.70]Come on.
[188:29.23]I take it back.
[188:29.79]I love this game.
[188:31.37]This game is fucking perfect.
[188:32.45]This is the best game we've played all night.
[188:34.41]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[188:39.70]When do I unlock new weapons?
[188:48.62]I need to do like the other levels.
[188:50.16]I gotta use this foolproof strategy and go somewhere else.
[188:54.11]I have to be getting close to the end of this, right?
[188:59.86]Somebody's behind me.
[189:03.21]Where's it coming from?
[189:05.87]Where is this guy?
[189:07.35]Oh, he's down there.
[189:18.10]Is this ready?
[189:20.88]Gotta be sneaky about it.
[189:36.11]It's perfect.
[189:37.93]There's nothing negative to say about this game.
[189:39.95]I'm not even kidding.
[189:41.50]It's perfect.
[189:42.94]You can't get better than this.
[189:45.08]It doesn't work that way.
[189:51.58]Oh, damn it.
[189:57.60]Come on.
[189:58.24]I want to be like the traffic guard.
[190:01.67]Shit.
[190:13.05]See ya.
[190:19.65]He just swat them away, it's so perfect.
[190:22.93]They just so haphazardly walk over to you and lose.
[190:26.31]Oh, he jumped over it, smart.
[190:34.20]You little shit.
[190:36.06]Hey!
[190:40.08]I accidentally killed him.
[190:44.21]I like the environments too.
[190:45.29]I like this game.
[190:47.43]It's fun.
[190:48.13]It's engaging.
[190:55.11]And you can do the fucking scissor chop and win.
[191:01.27]Please, can I please go to another level?
[191:02.87]I want to do another level of your fucking fantastic game.
[191:10.11]I can't do that.
[191:10.77]There's one more guy here.
[191:13.34]What about, like... Alright, I do... Okay, can't fuck around.
[191:29.77]I want other weapons.
[191:37.33]Way fine.
[191:37.95]New round.
[191:38.41]No, just get... Get me out of here.
[191:40.95]I want to go to another... I want to go to another place.
[191:43.21]No, don't save any video clips.
[191:44.53]Please, just go to, like, the other zone.
[191:48.21]How do I get out of here?
[191:48.95]Am I stuck here forever?
[191:53.09]There's gotta be another- I have to get back.
[191:55.17]How do I get back?
[191:56.79]I'm just gonna lose.
[191:59.41]Just kill me.
[192:01.31]Wait a minute, who the fuck are you?
[192:03.95]What the f- It's like Shang Tsung is fucking fighting me.
[192:10.59]Shang Tsung is like, after Papakae, we got, let's go, buddy.
[192:16.48]You think I'm fucking around?
[192:27.65]What, why, why, why, what work on you?
[192:35.01]My fucking foolproof strategy.
[192:43.87]What the?
[192:44.35]What?
[192:51.13]Fuck.
[193:01.73]New strategy.
[193:36.08]I love it.
[193:37.16]I definitely want to stop.
[193:40.36]Game ended.
[193:40.86]You won.
[193:42.41]60 kills.
[193:44.07]Oh, boy.
[193:45.69]Oh, it's fun.
[193:46.73]I like it.
[193:48.03]I can't wait to get to the next fucking level.
[193:50.77]We're going to the final level.
[193:53.13]You understand?
[193:55.00]Like, if you guys think that we're not going to the very last level, you are so... Come on.
[194:06.48]Okay, we're going to Sanctum Survival Extreme.
[194:16.53]Can I not?
[194:17.61]Do I have to beat everything in a row?
[194:22.58]Ah, you have to, like, unlock everything.
[194:24.48]Oh, that's horseshit.
[194:33.21]Oh, that's so unfair!
[194:38.23]Do I get different weapons if I go somewhere else?
[194:41.24]This is different.
[194:41.82]Let me just see what's here.
[194:43.80]I might get different weapons.
[194:47.22]I wonder what you guys are saying about this game.
[194:50.66]Pistol plasma sword.
[194:51.88]Oh, come on.
[194:59.26]That sucks.
[195:05.62]I can't.
[195:05.90]There's nothing else I can do here.
[195:09.22]Oh, come on.
[195:10.16]What?
[195:13.12]Looks cool.
[195:15.28]Well, the novelty wore off.
[195:39.69]It was very funny and very fun.
[195:41.47]The novelty wore off, though.
[195:42.91]Oh, well.
[195:57.70]Is that all I can do here?
[195:59.42]It has other weapons, though, oddly enough.
[196:03.78]I don't know how to get back to the main menu.
[196:06.84]So, I'm going to try to just die a bunch of times.
[196:13.85]I'm going to holster this.
[196:17.31]Get it right in the face.
[196:20.61]Come on, shoot me with a cheese ball.
[196:27.83]Okay.
[196:33.35]I have two lives left.
[196:37.16]No, just get me out of here.
[196:40.60]Just get me out.
[196:41.22]I don't want to... Start doesn't work.
[196:43.96]The menu doesn't work.
[196:44.96]Buttons don't work.
[196:46.28]I can't leave.
[196:48.96]I'm stuck here until it's over.
[196:51.42]Kind of like strangle him.
[197:05.75]No, please.
[197:06.53]Alright.
[197:08.55]I'm going to try one last thing.
[197:14.85]There they are.
[197:15.63]Down there, right?
[197:16.21]Where are you guys?
[197:18.95]Where are you?
[197:19.57]I was trying to do the Macarena.
[197:34.52]Alright, well I'm gonna put it on medium and see if I have new weapons.
[197:38.04]If I don't have new weapons, then we're gone.
[197:40.93]What?
[197:41.27]Why am I still here?
[197:42.15]It just said I had zero lives.
[197:43.27]What the fuck?
[197:45.25]Get me out of here.
[197:47.63]Oh my lord.
[197:53.57]That's it.
[197:54.59]That's it.
[197:54.91]I have no more lives.
[197:55.89]You lost all your lives.
[197:56.88]Thank god.
[197:57.40]I just want to see if there's any other weapons.
[198:03.58]How much was this game?
[198:06.86]I really hope this game was not more than like 20 bucks.
[198:09.76]It might have been.
[198:10.40]No, definitely not.
[198:14.09]Because on the medium levels, I might get more weapons.
[198:18.09]It's definitely worth checking out.
[198:23.09]And then there's one more thing I want to do.
[198:25.84]See, like medium, right?
[198:28.62]Let's just see if we get any new weapons.
[198:30.52]Come on.
[198:31.98]Give me a break.
[198:32.36]Of course not.
[198:41.33]Alright.
[198:42.19]So...
[198:44.22]We can't play Rollercoaster Dreams.
[198:47.42]I wish we could.
[198:49.38]I really wish we could.
[198:53.66]Give me one second.
[198:58.34]Give me a second.
[199:01.90]Because I feel like we have to try that before I stop streaming.
[199:10.28]I'm going to plug this thing in.
[199:12.67]I'm going to at least attempt to.
[199:15.25]because I think I can give me one minute guys one minute one minute oh whoops okay so where is it I can plug that in I'm just gonna sit down and I have to build a roller coaster and ride it you guys know that I'm just gonna plug the controller in because it's a slot I can still use not this one right here okay

[199:45.71]I don't fucking think so.
[199:49.55]I really just don't think I have another micro USB.
[199:51.35]I have plenty of fucking mini USBs.
[199:57.73]Is this a micro USB?
[200:03.41]No.
[200:03.95]Fuck.
[200:06.21]It's not.

[200:49.11]Are we in frame?
[200:53.14]Yes, we are.
[200:53.64]Okay.
[200:53.96]This is fine.
[200:56.16]Alright.
[200:57.62]I just confirmed the existence of God.
[201:01.52]Not on purpose.
[201:04.23]Okay.

[201:22.59]Wait a minute.
[201:25.47]Ben.
[201:29.16]I'm just noticing, well, I have no, I'm inside of like a fucking machine.
[201:32.84]I have no way to see bits.
[201:35.00]Holy shit.
[201:37.54]Okay.
[201:39.22]Ben Elnor.
[201:40.42]Ben gave 50 bucks here.
[201:42.78]Cheer, 5,000.
[201:44.74]Ofas gave 5,000 bits, 50 bucks.
[201:49.99]Just set up a PayPal or Patreon, you pleb.
[201:52.25]I hate giving Amazon 30%.
[201:53.99]It's been talked about before.
[202:00.05]There's a lot of moving parts.
[202:03.50]But thank you so much, dude.
[202:04.62]Thank you for the 50 bucks regardless.
[202:08.44]And Trita, thank you for the $10 donation.
[202:12.54]Buy a Vive Live.
[202:15.18]No, I'm gonna put my, like, credit card.
[202:17.62]Yeah, I don't think it's that much for... I don't think it's that much for bits.
[202:21.82]I think that if you buy, like, a dollar in bits, it's, like, something like that, right?
[202:25.74]But if you buy, doesn't it come down, like, in price or something?
[202:28.81]The more you buy?
[202:30.93]It's still... There is a percentage.
[202:32.25]There still is.
[202:32.89]But I don't think it's that 30%.
[202:33.91]But what the hell do I know?
[202:36.51]I'm just a fucking idiot.
[202:38.59]Anyways, thank you so much, Antrito.
[202:41.57]Also to Jez42 for the 10 bucks.
[202:43.46]Contributing for the Vive.
[202:44.68]Love the stream.

[203:25.43]But thank you for the hundred bucks.
[203:26.37]It means a lot.
[203:28.39]That's a lot of fucking money to give in one second.

[203:46.70]Well, the next stream, I'll probably be having a fucking next VR stream.
[203:52.92]I probably won't be using this anymore.
[203:55.98]But thanks a lot, Ben.
[203:58.87]You're single-handedly, like, running my checking account up.
[204:05.95]It's incredibly fucking generous of you.
[204:10.08]But thank you, dude.

[204:14.80]Oh, fucking God.

[204:25.04]Ben gave another hundred bucks.
[204:28.59]So he gave $50,000 and $50,000.

[204:48.68]It's fucking... You guys are fucking incredible.
[204:51.76]You guys just spoil the absolute shit out of me all the time.
[204:57.35]And it does not go unnoticed.
[205:01.11]Trust me when I say that.
[205:05.22]That's a lot of money going around here.
[205:09.10]Also, thank you to... Where did I leave off before?
[205:11.14]A lot of people gave, like, fucking... Like, five bucks, one dollar, one dollar, three, one, one, one, one, one.
[205:17.47]There's a lot of them.
[205:19.05]Party Crabs, Kill Gannon, thanks for the bits.
[205:21.81]Kill Gannon again, thanks for the four dollars, five dollars total.
[205:25.55]Remember, you can't play spooky games and not enable this random emote.
[205:31.27]What do you mean, not enable?
[205:35.23]Is this the Back to the Future sequel where you play as Marty McFly?
[205:38.27]Because he's played by... Wait, what?
[205:42.97]No.
[205:45.25]What do I look like?
[205:45.93]Do I look like Marty McFly?
[205:47.41]Am I going, like, Back to the Future on you?
[205:52.24]Anyways, thank you so much, everybody.
[205:55.51]Yeah, what is like... What is that emote?
[206:02.89]Enable... What is it?
[206:05.31]I don't understand it.
[206:06.09]I don't have BTTTV.
[206:07.65]Better twitch.tv, right?
[206:09.03]Alright, I think I'm caught up.
[206:14.09]I'm like flabbergasted, guys.
[206:16.91]And then somebody came in with $15 right now.

[206:20.11]Thank you to Modest Narcissist.
[206:23.23]Thanks for the $15.
[206:25.26]TechnoToast, thanks for the $5.

[206:35.86]Unbelievable.
[206:39.54]This is, like, the... Understand.
[206:41.14]Understand something real important.
[206:42.06]Like, this is the fucking reason why... Like, I take this, like, video shit, like, dead fucking serious.
[206:49.66]Because when, like, when I see this, when I look over here and I see people giving fucking hundreds of dollars...
[206:56.43]Like, I better take it fucking dead serious.
[207:00.74]I'm in, like, talks with fucking Warner Brothers and shit like that and, like, Machinima.
[207:04.40]Like, I take this shit dead fucking serious.
[207:09.51]I take it seriously as stupid as I do on these streams and as like dumb as I can be sometimes when I'm making videos and like, if I'm going to be like a fucking Warner Brothers video maker or something like it's no, this is, I see this shit and it makes me realize like it, it brings you down a couple notches.
[207:25.56]You know what I mean?
[207:25.98]It makes you like understand life.
[207:31.04]I wish I could explain it more, um,
[207:34.05]More in-depth, but maybe I will eventually here.
[207:36.99]If I do what I'm gonna do or if I don't, I'll talk about it more candidly.
[207:42.23]But thank you, everybody, for the money.
[207:46.36]It allows me to continue to do what I do, so thanks.
[207:49.58]Let's build a rollercoaster and then... Somebody said I suck.
[207:54.04]You suck.
[207:56.20]Well, that's your opinion and you're allowed to have it.
[207:59.45]Whatever you say.
[208:01.21]I can't tell you that you're wrong because that's how you feel.
[208:05.78]Sorry you feel that way.
[208:07.60]Let's go.
[208:11.40]Going in.
[208:16.76]There we are.

[208:25.65]Are we good?
[208:28.89]Yes.
[208:29.19]Let's go.
[208:32.63]I think I can build a roller coaster and then ride it.
[208:37.19]So we're going to do something fucking crazy.
[208:40.21]Right?
[208:40.41]That's what we have to do.
[208:41.37]Bimbo soft.
[208:43.22]Bimbo soft.
[208:44.52]I got it wrong.
[208:48.12]Okay.

[213:29.86]This is gonna hurt, being on this.
[213:44.32]I'm making like a child's drawing in a coloring book.
[213:49.06]I don't think this is gonna work.
[213:53.68]I may need to slow down.
[214:02.29]How do I connect it?
[214:02.99]I just want to ride it once and then end the stream.
[214:04.87]I mean, this is really actually pretty fucking cool.
[214:09.03]If I'm gonna, like, you know, lie, I might as well not lie.

[215:04.56]Yeah, I know.
[215:09.08]I get it.
[215:15.03]This is not safe.
[215:23.30]I don't think I would ride this.

[235:50.78]How do I get out?
[235:55.40]Get me out.
[235:56.34]Why are my fingers all bloody and chapped up?
[236:01.26]I was fucking strangling somebody before I got on this ride.
[236:07.16]Is it always that same guy?
[236:09.19]Yeah, it is.
[236:11.63]Wait, hold on, it might not be.
[236:26.65]That's me.
[236:27.69]I thought he was behind me.
[236:32.36]I thought he was fucking behind me.

[237:33.09]No, we're not gonna ride that.
[237:35.93]What about the pyramid?
[237:36.65]What about the space shooting games?
[237:39.19]I gotta get out of VR to do this, I think.
[237:48.20]Of course.
[237:49.66]I gotta get out of VR mode to do these.
[237:51.26]That's so annoying.
[237:53.98]Not this one.
[237:55.15]Alright, this is Asteroid Crisis.
[238:12.38]This music is unbearable.
[238:19.66]I feel like I got this game out of a fucking Captain Crunch box.
[238:23.00]For real.
[238:29.38]I need to know what the haunted house is like.
[238:31.62]You know what I'm saying?

[239:48.28]You can't win this.
[239:50.94]You don't win this game.
[239:53.52]Don't even let her scream.
[239:58.94]All it does is just add more fucking assets.
[240:04.15]Get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out, get me out.
[240:15.30]This guy's not even a zombie.
[240:17.74]Look at this guy's face.

[240:36.79]Who wants to take a wild guess that it's gonna be a square room with a bunch of random fucking like unity assets walking around in circles and if you touch them you die?
[240:49.65]No?
[240:55.27]Actually, it's like, it's not what I thought it was gonna be.
[241:10.57]I actually don't like this.
[241:13.79]I don't like this.
[241:14.37]I really don't.
[241:14.81]I'm gonna get scared.
[241:15.35]It's gonna scare me.
[241:15.93]I'm not even kidding.
[241:16.77]The FOV is terrible.
[241:17.81]There's a guy walking around.
[241:18.79]It's gonna be a fucking random guy in a suit.
[241:30.68]Is there even a ghost?
[241:39.30]Where is he?
[241:39.90]Alright, we're gonna do like very hard then.
[241:55.77]I'm scared, but I know it's gonna be like a goofy fucking image.
[242:07.68]Where is he?
[242:15.05]Where is he?
[242:15.77]Come on, hurry up.
[242:22.27]He's close.
[242:29.43]I'm so scared.
[242:32.45]My controller is rumbling like crazy.
[242:54.20]It was just fucking nothing.
[243:03.93]This is not what this looks like.
[243:05.15]No, in fact, I refuse to even give... Time for the panda and then the stream's over.
[243:14.03]We're doing the slide, we're doing the panda, and I'm out.
[243:19.45]Can I do anything with the building?
[243:20.81]Is the building a ride?
[243:22.57]Or is it just like a skyscraper?
[243:24.37]It's just like a pizza place.
[243:31.95]Okay, that's a huge fucking pizza place.
[243:37.39]Panda.
[243:39.39]Wherever it is.
[243:55.70]Alright, we got a bunch of like random kids behind the wheel.
[243:59.94]What is happening?
[244:01.58]I don't have any control of this.
[244:13.23]This would be extremely unsafe.
[244:18.45]And you tell me my roller coaster wasn't cool?
[244:27.61]People are gonna get hurt on this ride.
[244:37.86]I mean, we gotta do them.
[244:39.36]Let's go.
[245:05.37]This is awful.
[245:11.55]Is my car gonna explode?
[245:12.77]Why is it doing that?
[245:16.70]I can't escape this fucking stupid theme park.
[245:23.10]Alright.
[245:24.44]Panda.
[245:26.06]And get me out.
[245:28.18]I don't even know where the entrance is.
[245:29.52]I'm just lost.
[245:32.13]No, not asteroid rally.
[245:33.33]No, get out.
[245:35.90]I need to quit free walking.
[245:38.42]Okay, where the fuck am I?
[245:39.82]Over here.
[245:44.91]Fuck.
[245:45.75]It didn't even put me in the right place.
[245:46.81]There we go.
[245:53.65]Alright.
[245:54.83]It's gonna happen.
[245:55.93]Everybody just chill out.
[246:02.71]It's time to go into the panda house.
[246:04.42]This is what you've all been waiting for.
[246:08.26]Jump as you like.
[246:08.96]Okay, I'm

[246:36.14]But, I guess... That's me.
[246:43.22]Hope you liked it.
[246:44.36]Hope that was everything you guys wanted.
[246:45.50]Because we're gonna end the stream on the slide.
[246:52.42]Fuck, we can't see myself.
[246:55.43]How do I go?
[246:55.83]Can you tell me I couldn't do this in VR?
[247:08.70]Hello?
[247:09.08]Well, that's not a- good thing I was playing the most childish game ever.
[247:18.13]Hold on, give me one second.
[248:00.05]Just locked herself out of the fucking house.
[248:05.26]Like, what the fuck?
[248:08.04]If she's not, she's sick.
[248:08.82]She's trying to, like, jump scare me in every walk of life, apparently.
[248:15.24]Alright, well, that was the end anyways.
[248:18.16]It's Boppo's Revenge.
[248:19.34]Check the options.

[250:04.20]Do you want to use the facility?
[250:05.82]The tracks are going to cause you to fucking puke.
[250:10.50]There's no difference here.
[250:11.66]It's the exact same.
[250:12.46]The only thing is I could...
[250:28.43]I don't want to do the haunted house again in fucking VR mode.
[250:31.72]Nothing's going to be different.
[250:32.84]It's going to be the same shit experience that you've seen the whole time.

[254:13.08]Good thing there's a huge helmet on me.
[254:14.26]Oh, I'm like mentally drained right now.
[254:19.99]Even this is like causing problems.

[255:51.79]A little girl, which attraction will I ride next?
[255:57.17]A lady, I forgot to mention that this amusement park is really good.
[256:10.68]I wonder if you can get them.
[256:11.60]Look at that one down there.
[256:14.04]Look at that one.
[256:14.50]That's the one I'm riding.
[256:26.33]I love how these are just the zombies, by the way.
[256:29.61]These guys are all the zombie assets.
[256:33.43]What happened to this theme park?
[256:35.21]I suffer from withdrawal symptoms if I don't take cold medicine.
[256:44.19]Okay, that sounds like that guy has a couple of issues.
[256:52.62]I would buy this amusement park for $30.
[256:54.56]Okay.
[256:59.70]I'll go home and eat instant noodles.
[257:05.21]I believe that a prince riding on a horse will come someday.
[257:11.62]I won 14 million dollars at the casino.
[257:23.46]I'll be going back to Sicily soon.
[257:26.24]I don't care about what these patrons have to say.
[257:28.00]Bathroom.
[257:30.19]There's no one.
[257:30.51]I want to ride the roller coaster.
[257:35.73]Not that one, the extreme one.
[257:40.91]Am I the same guy?
[257:42.23]Of course I am.
[257:47.28]I'm already feeling motion sick.
[257:51.46]Already.
[257:53.40]I'm like blinking a bunch of times in this VR helmet.
[258:00.23]Fuck me.
[258:06.08]The second I start to feel like I'm gonna throw up, I'm fucking pausing the game.

[264:26.40]No, it's not going to happen.
[264:28.48]Because then if I make that incentive available, then that means that it happened and it could happen again.
