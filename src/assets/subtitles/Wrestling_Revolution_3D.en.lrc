[00:00.95]But wait, actually, wait a minute.
[00:01.91]Wait a minute.
[00:02.27]I'm not going to be able to do a whole stream on this.
[00:05.11]So I might as well just do it now.
[00:06.17]Because I'm here.
[00:09.13]So, like, we're going to do it now.
[00:11.60]Stream ain't over.
[00:13.20]Hold on.
[00:13.52]There's something I wanted to do real quick.
[00:19.82]Here.
[00:21.12]This is not going to take more than 10 minutes.
[00:22.46]I just want to do something.
[00:23.70]I'm going to put the BRB up.
[00:27.57]While I figure this out.
[01:10.31]So I can't do a whole stream on this.
[01:12.99]But, like, this is the M. Dickie game, uh, Wrestling Revolution 3D.
[01:18.29]Like, I, this, there's no way this is a full stream.
[01:22.89]But we can at least just fucking run for, like, a few minutes.
[01:26.96]Because I was gonna, like, get a fucking whole thing and do, like, a whole stream on this and make it, like, a joke before the last rumble.
[01:33.22]But, like, we're not doing that.
[01:35.86]So we're gonna do, we're gonna do a, we're gonna do a rumble.
[01:40.93]Death vs. Blood, Fist Fight, Shoot Fight, Triple Threat, Handicap, Tag Team, Tag Elimination, Simultaneous, War, Elimination.
[01:54.26]Okay.
[01:59.02]30 Wrestlers.
[02:02.98]No pins, no submissions.
[02:05.69]Count as Elimination.
[02:10.73]We're gonna put blood on.
[02:13.18]Referees.
[02:14.20]Why is there one referee?
[02:17.62]Okay, there's gonna be a referee in the ring.
[02:21.18]Cast.
[02:21.70]I didn't make anybody.
[02:23.00]I didn't really have a chance to.
[02:24.41]So we're just gonna do a 30-man rumble and see how it goes.
[02:30.55]Blood.
[02:30.99]Elimination.
[02:31.53]We're just gonna give it a try.
[02:33.17]So this is gonna be a 30-man rumble with one referee.
[02:38.22]Oh god!
[02:40.35]Okay, all 30 people are in the ring at the same time.
[02:43.44]How do I control the game?
[02:45.66]What character am I?
[02:52.60]Where- I don't even know who I'm playing as.
[03:00.09]What the fuck is happening?
[03:09.36]How do you find what character you are?
[03:15.97]It's just a fucking madhouse.
[03:18.97]There's no rhyme or reason to any of this.
[03:21.13]It's so loud.
[03:23.65]Tab?
[03:23.97]What does tab do?
[03:25.03]Oh, I can switch characters.
[03:32.00]Alright, dude, this is just adamant.
