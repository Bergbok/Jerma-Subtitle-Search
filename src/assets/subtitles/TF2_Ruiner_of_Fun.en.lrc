[00:03.86]For these first couple of clips, it's really important to note something here, that I am playing with Jerma, he's trying to make a Team Fortress 2 video, but he doesn't know that I'm playing with him.
[00:13.34]I'm on an alternate account, so I'm not on his friends list, but seriously, he's on to me now.
[00:17.65]He's paranoid even when I'm not playing.
[00:19.31]I'm going tryhard, Jerma, as demo.
[00:25.19]Let's see how this happens.
[00:26.01]Did you already watch this?
[00:30.00]You wanna play that game?
[00:31.19]Yeah, keep, like, keep, like, knocking me around.
[00:33.05]You fucking cunt.
[00:34.17]Because there's three people in there gonna shit in everybody in this room's cereal.
[00:40.43]And by that, I mean miss every shot.
[00:42.61]That's okay.
[00:43.69]If I don't get three headshots in a row right now, I'm going to reach into the toilet and eat my own shit.
[00:51.84]Wow.
[00:53.20]Here we go.
[00:53.54]Let's see.
[00:56.86]I gotta... I'll be back.
[00:58.14]I gotta go eat my own shit.
[01:03.76]I'm not gonna use that.
[01:04.48]You think I'm gonna use that?
[01:05.28]What, are you crazy?
[01:06.20]Are you crazy?
[01:07.86]Damn sentry over there.
[01:08.82]There's a sentry up there too, isn't there?
[01:10.86]Whoa, whoa, hey.
[01:12.62]What the fuck?
[01:18.94]Get the f- I sure as hell thought this was just you.
[01:26.41]What?
[01:27.89]There was a Pyro, just airblasting me in the air.
[01:31.51]Over and over again.
[01:33.94]I really checked, and I was like, that's Star, and it's not you.
[01:38.82]I would add him to friends.
[01:39.80]Who is he?
[01:41.51]Ow.
[01:49.17]Ow.
[01:50.93]Oh, this guy's name is YouSucks.
[01:55.66]Oh my god, that's you.
[01:59.47]Oh, and I got it on recording that you got upset about it.
[02:02.65]Oh, my God.
[02:03.73]You fucking dick.
[02:07.61]Oh, you think you're cool, and you sucks.
[02:09.81]I'm really... Well, okay, so I saw... I saw the, uh... I saw the arrow, and I was like, wait a minute.
[02:21.00]Oh, what... God damn it.
[02:24.42]You... I came to ruin your gameplay.
[02:29.13]I want to get a calculated mathematician to explain to me why you're being a real dick right now.
[02:38.27]Why did I find two bloodsuckers?
[02:41.43]Give me something different, please.
[02:43.31]I need the whip.
[02:43.81]I need the whip.
[02:44.27]I need the whip.
[02:45.03]Well, just don't go.
[02:49.38]You can't hold back when you got the whip, especially not on pyro.
[02:54.26]You mad right now?
[02:58.13]Alright, come here.
[03:00.23]Come here, I want you to go as fast as possible.
[03:11.97]Too fast, too quick.
[03:13.80]Hey Jorma, I'm going with you.
[03:17.38]Oh, a zacker!
[03:24.44]Use it.
[03:29.38]Oh, man.
[03:30.10]How did you get that?
[03:31.82]He didn't move.
[03:33.86]Oh, he hit a spy!
[03:35.03]So, do you think you can do this for, like, seven more minutes?
[03:44.67]Like, six and a half more minutes?
[03:46.31]Not with the cart right there.
[03:48.97]We got our heavy punching the cart.
[03:51.12]It's okay.
[03:51.74]Don't worry.
[03:52.16]He's punching the cart.
[03:53.50]We're good.
[03:54.24]This is another, like, full five minutes of this.
[03:58.95]You got him.
[03:59.33]Second time I got him.
[04:00.81]Three, two, one.
[04:05.00]Screw you.
