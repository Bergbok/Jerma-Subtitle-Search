[ve:60.16.100]

[00:12.94]Okay.
[00:14.74]So I'm going to go over the rules of this challenge.
[00:19.51]This is super punch out.
[00:24.23]And this is going to go as follows.
[00:30.61]No knockdowns.
[00:36.16]Let's see if I can do it.
[00:38.42]We don't need to bet.
[00:40.38]Can I do this with no knockdowns for me?
[00:44.44]No TKOs or no knockdowns at all.
[00:48.13]That's going to be really hard, but we'll see.
[00:50.11]All right, you ready?
[00:57.89]I got it up right here.
[00:58.71]All right, so Super Punch-Out is one of my favorite games.
[01:08.10]Pretty much ever.
[01:10.26]I'd say it's in the top 20, top 10.
[01:11.24]Maybe top 20.
[01:16.43]I gotta remember the controls.
[01:19.31]Button setting mode?
[01:20.29]Hold on.
[01:22.21]Alright, B is right punch, left punch is Y, and then A is the knockout punch.
[01:27.13]Power up is, yeah, that's fine.
[01:29.41]Okay, that's all I need.
[01:32.81]A is the big punch.
[01:35.31]You guys ready?
[01:38.96]No knockdowns.
[01:41.18]What's the penalty if I fail?
[01:42.44]For every time I get knocked down, I... For every time I get knocked down, what's a good thing to put here?
[01:49.73]I'm gonna say this game sucks.
[01:52.53]It does not.
[01:53.73]Come on.
[02:01.48]Uh... Every time you get knocked down, one stream of Tears of the Kingdom.
[02:08.08]Oh, no.
[02:09.24]No, I don't think so.
[02:15.70]It's not that I don't want to do that.
[02:17.72]I don't want to give people the idea that if... Let's say I just am completely wrong and I'm just really rusty and I can't do this.
[02:23.54]If I get knocked down ten times... I didn't even stream Breath of the Wild ten times.
[02:33.34]Every five knockdowns, you need to do that.
[02:35.96]Uh...
[02:39.77]Do you hate Zelda?
[02:40.79]No, I just don't.
[02:41.91]Never was really into the franchise, really.
[02:44.77]Like I said, that's the first time I played Zelda since Ocarina of Time.
[02:48.15]Just kind of let it all pass by me for some reason.
[02:50.48]Alright, well, it's not going to happen here, so we can figure it out.
[02:59.74]I might not even get hurt here.
[03:33.41]Okay, we're good.
[03:39.78]Yay!
[03:41.16]Fall down.
[03:44.92]Oh, come on.
[03:48.28]Oh, fuck!
[03:48.76]I forgot that's what that move did.
[03:50.12]I thought I had an extra second.
[03:52.17]We're good.
[03:56.03]I thought I had an extra second.
[04:01.03]He's not getting off, don't worry.
[04:03.34]We're good.
[04:03.92]It's knockdowns, not taking damage.
[04:07.58]I got hit by Gappy J, but it's okay.
[04:12.97]That's not a knockdown.
[04:17.63]Who's after Gappy J?
[04:18.71]It's... That's from when I played.
[04:23.55]That's me.
[04:26.48]Alright, yeah.
[04:27.62]Bear Hugger.
[04:34.32]No punching is a great rule.
[04:35.64]What?
[04:36.66]Oops.
[04:41.38]Okay.
[04:42.66]Could have had it.
[05:08.29]Goal health.
[05:09.45]Play the Wii one.
[05:10.31]I did a long time ago.
[05:11.49]I want to say like three or four years ago.
[05:14.05]Whoa.
[05:17.71]Why?
[05:17.99]What's happening?
[05:19.07]Okay, there we go.
[05:28.06]Bear hugger really showed up in nothing but overalls.
[05:30.30]Got it.
[05:39.93]Do you think they'll ever do another Punch-Out game?
[05:41.21]Because we got Punch-Out Wii, and then they kind of just didn't really ever do it again.
[05:47.69]Okay.
[05:55.40]Alright, I have to remember the pattern here, because you can get caught, and I think it's either it starts up or it starts down, and I don't remember.
[06:07.55]I might take a little bit of damage here.
[06:25.53]I actually might put on the other controller for this because the D-pad on this thing stinks.
[06:32.83]Got him.
[06:40.66]I thought I almost had him one hit.
[06:51.73]Stay down.
[06:56.74]Yes!
[07:00.99]How did this guy not beat Ganon?
[07:02.65]Oh, you said, did you say beat Ganon or not beat Ganon?
[07:10.67]Is the game easy?
[07:13.74]Not the first circuit kind of is, but this is where it heats up a little.
[07:18.42]Uh, the game is actually, it's about just patterns and memorization.
[07:23.65]See, I just remember every single thing that these guys do.
[07:37.70]I have to catch it, because otherwise you die in one hit.
[07:43.00]Can I catch it?
[07:43.44]What do you guys think?
[07:52.29]He charges at you and he'll kill you in one swing.
[07:57.63]I don't know.
[07:58.09]Follow your heart.
[08:05.29]We might not even see it.
[08:12.94]Fall down.
[08:16.00]There it is.
[08:18.31]Fuck!
[08:19.75]I just ripped up my fucking power cable.
[08:22.73]Shit.
[08:26.27]Well, the challenge is over.
[08:28.97]I ripped up... Hold on a second.
[08:34.45]I was a little late.
[08:35.67]I was a little late.
[08:44.43]Too bad.
[08:45.89]I got cocky.
[08:46.73]You don't have to do that.
[08:48.53]But I just got really cocky.
[08:50.07]It's okay.
[08:57.66]See, you have to do this.
[08:59.68]You do have to catch him, though, maybe.
[09:01.00]No, actually, yeah.
[09:01.52]I got cocky.
[09:02.34]That's my own fault.
[09:06.48]I just won, too.
[09:08.28]That's one Tears of the Kingdom stream.
[09:10.04]No, I didn't agree to that.
[09:18.30]Damn it.
[09:21.28]I was thinking I was going to get through that without getting knocked down once.
[09:30.36]The other germa beat it.
[09:32.62]Three seconds faster than I did.
[09:37.76]I did better than I did before, though.
[09:41.19]Alright, circuit two.
[09:53.68]This is... Bob Charlie.
[09:56.91]There's... Who else is in this?
[09:58.89]Where's the clown?
[09:59.81]The clown is really hard.
[10:14.42]I shouldn't even be alternating swinging actually.
[10:23.99]the gut.
[10:24.99]Alright, so far so good.
[10:32.88]Ooh, alright.
[10:45.34]This is, I remember this.
[10:46.12]He goes this way.
[10:46.84]There you go.
[10:52.05]See you later.
[10:58.93]Kind of quick.
[11:01.00]Oh, alright.
[11:02.02]That's pretty rare.
[11:02.60]Almost 30 seconds.
[11:05.84]That's pretty good.
[11:06.34]$31.99?
[11:07.14]That's way faster than I did it before.
[11:24.11]Look at a minute 30 from when I did it last time.
[11:26.77]I forget what this guy does.
[11:35.40]He does like a kick.
[11:36.40]There's like two or three kicks that you have to be aware about.
[11:46.42]The timing on this guy is kind of weird too.
[12:05.23]Ah, shit.
[12:06.16]That's my fault.
[12:10.38]I hit his heel.
[12:16.88]Oh, it's down.
[12:17.38]It's down!
[12:18.14]Yep.
[12:18.56]Got it.
[12:22.57]That'll kill you in one hit, by the way.
[12:29.17]I'm not being efficient either.
[12:34.93]I should be way more efficient than this.
[12:36.21]This is sloppy.
[12:39.23]I should be hitting him two or three times before it, because you can hit him up to a certain amount of times when you do that, like one, two, three, four.
[12:46.89]OK, so do three.
[12:48.25]One, two, three, swing.
[12:51.99]Whoops.
[12:58.88]Whoo, that was close.
[13:08.01]He really is goaded at games with two buttons, I told you!
[13:11.24]Just give me three buttons and a directional and I got it.
[13:23.90]Better than before?
[13:27.84]All right.
[13:28.52]This guy, there's nothing flashy.
[13:31.22]He just has a ton of health and he hurts a lot.
[13:34.22]And his timings are a little... Wait, he spits in your face too.
[13:36.41]I think it's you have to do down.
[13:37.35]Let's try it.
[13:57.37]Yep.
[13:58.07]It's the spit.
[13:58.87]Got it.
[14:02.03]I love watching Gerber go from fumbling about in Breath of the Wild like a buffoon to nearly sweeping all of Super Punch-Out!!
[14:08.75]It is funny how that happens, huh?
[14:11.52]Oh no, don't sit.
[14:12.06]Don't talk now.
[14:24.62]Try to catch him there.
[14:27.67]Oh, don't be silly.
[14:29.63]Don't be silly about this.
[14:46.78]Oh, the D-pad fucked up.
[14:55.47]Nice.
[14:56.67]No downs.
[14:57.25]That's the whole second circuit.
[15:03.51]I'm even... I'm eating frozen grapes right now.
[15:08.79]They're goaded.
[15:12.00]They are so delicious, honestly.
[15:13.42]I actually... Holly and I tried the frozen blueberries that a lot of people were talking about.
[15:20.46]They're up there, too.
[15:22.77]And no joking around, I actually really do mean this.
[15:27.04]If you're actually having trouble getting fruits and vegetables into your diet, it's a great way to do it.
[15:35.50]Frozen blueberries and frozen grapes.
[15:37.53]Seedless red grapes, by the way.
[15:41.93]I look forward to eating these.
[15:46.98]It's not like, oh yeah, I have to eat vegetables and fruits.
[15:50.98]I eat like a pizza today.
[15:52.86]Did I even eat anything good for me?
[15:55.18]Oh, I got frozen blueberries and frozen grapes in the freezer.
[15:57.39]They're like a little treat.
[15:59.33]You look forward to eating them.
[16:01.57]It's a really good way to get some extra fruits in your diet.
[16:04.95]Seriously.
[16:08.23]Yeah, and when they come out of the... Okay, this one's going to be hard, but... When they come out of the freezer, don't just chomp on them.
[16:15.41]Let them sit out for a minute or two.
[16:17.21]Let them get a little bit softer on the outside.
[16:18.77]I don't know.
[16:19.81]Maybe you like it like that.
[16:20.99]I like it kind of frozen, but just don't bite into them like a popsicle.
[16:24.23]I forget what this guy does.
[16:33.38]I have to stop talking.
[16:36.93]Yeah, he does the triple.
[16:37.61]That's what it is.
[16:38.07]Okay.
[16:42.25]Okay, that usually kills you.
[16:49.06]I'm good.
[17:01.44]I'm good.
[17:01.70]I'm good.
[17:01.88]Go, go, go.
[17:19.04]Dammit!
[17:19.74]I thought he did it twice.
[17:21.46]Sorry.
[17:31.73]One more hour of Tears of the Kingdom.
[17:40.11]Yep, that thing is brutal by the way.
[17:51.99]How come I can't block?
[17:53.31]What's going on with that?
[17:54.45]Usually you can block up.
[18:06.24]Come on, man.
[18:08.72]What the fuck?
[18:18.75]Alright, the D-pad on the Pro Controller really is, like, an absolute piece of shit.
[18:23.87]It's one gigantic button.
[18:25.95]That when you press left, you press all the buttons at the same time.
[18:42.58]Use the Joy-Cons?
[18:43.28]I actually... Yeah, that's a good idea.
[18:47.36]Mmm...
[18:48.41]no I think I'll be fine way worse than the other jeremy by the way all right well that's all right it's two downs no losses though which are good because I want to hopefully do no losses okay aaron ryan this is
[19:16.20]This guy has... It's all about the lower blocking.
[19:20.31]He's gonna grab.
[19:32.30]Nah!
[19:34.54]Shit.
[19:36.56]You can usually catch him right there.
[19:47.38]Come on, dude.
[19:53.29]Here it comes.
[19:53.91]Okay, I got it.
[20:01.65]Whoa, you're still going.
[20:13.66]Cool, we're good.
[20:14.36]Alright, let me get some health back.
[20:28.59]Almost had it again.
[20:42.68]Starts it up I think.
[21:09.40]Come on!
[21:13.81]Right, this is it.
[21:36.21]Shit.
[21:52.79]Sit down.
[21:54.11]Three Tears of the Kingdom minutes.
[21:58.93]Looking at it on the Nintendo Shop Store page.
[22:02.35]Can you believe it?
[22:11.34]Alright.
[22:12.18]That's actually, I think, the harder of all the ones in this final circuit.
[22:19.47]Something with the hair.
[22:20.25]There's a hair flip.
[22:22.31]There's a hair flip.
[22:23.43]I forget which side it's on.
[22:24.81]I think it's a hair flip on the left side, I think.
[22:28.51]I don't know.
[22:50.42]Good.
[22:51.94]Good.
[22:52.40]That's a good start.
[22:56.93]I got full health.
[22:57.39]I'm good.
[23:02.25]Oh, that was started early.
[23:03.25]Okay, which side is it on?
[23:04.17]I think it's... Okay, it's left and then it's down.
[23:07.01]That's what it is.
[23:07.43]I got it.
[23:25.36]Alright, get some health.
[23:41.24]Woohoo!
[23:42.32]See you later.
[23:47.32]I did it!
[23:47.66]Alright, we're almost there.
[23:57.70]Only two more?
[23:58.34]That was pretty good.
[24:02.70]That was clean.
[24:03.20]Not as clean as, uh... Ah.
[24:10.99]There's the clown.
[24:11.69]Alright.
[24:13.35]Clown does this... This move with the balls.
[24:20.24]So it's a bear hugger skin.
[24:22.36]But... Forget some things.
[24:31.33]Yep, it's that other way.
[24:32.85]They trick you.
[24:34.31]That's a one hit kill, by the way.
[24:36.35]Good start.
[24:43.24]One, two, three, four.
[25:10.71]How fast is the speedrun?
[25:11.64]It's probably ridiculous.
[25:17.28]Where did that come from?
[25:24.04]Alright, well we did it.
[25:26.98]No downs.
[25:34.83]Would you fight a 400 pound clown?
[25:37.37]In real life?
[25:40.23]If I had to.
[25:46.41]That was way better than the last time I played it.
[25:47.81]Okay.
[25:52.44]This is the last boss of the game.
[25:55.60]Technically.
[25:57.94]This guy has a bunch of really awful stuff.
[26:00.84]I don't know if I'll do it, but I'll try.
[26:04.22]He has this spin overhead swing move that you have to duck under like three times.
[26:08.67]Let's go.
[26:25.64]Ay!
[26:28.91]There it is.
[26:29.31]Okay, when he goes... I'm out of rhythm.
[26:44.54]Fuck.
[26:45.66]Thought I was gonna spin.
[26:59.59]Shit.
[27:04.00]No, I got it.
[27:04.88]I got it.
[27:09.20]This guy sucks.
[27:15.56]He does a little hop too.
[27:16.88]It's awful.
[27:44.82]Can you tell how frequently I've gotten to the end here?
[27:49.41]We're doing this, by the way.
[27:52.21]Just rewinding.
[28:02.74]Is it block?
[28:03.82]How do you do that?
[28:04.94]Let me see.
[28:05.62]I think it's just block up.
[28:07.96]Maybe it is just up.
[28:08.68]Let me see.
[28:09.66]Do it again.
[28:11.10]No.
[28:11.32]No.
[28:26.96]Sometimes he does it three times.
[28:27.84]God damn it.
[28:32.36]Yeah, it's already over.
[28:33.58]I couldn't beat the final boss without being downed.
[28:35.90]It's over.
[28:36.32]Fine.
[28:36.54]I don't care.
[28:38.88]This guy is very hard.
[28:47.43]Shit!
[28:56.27]It's so funny.
[28:56.67]You can see, you can just tell when you just get so full, just so out.
[28:59.59]This is a rhythm game and it's very hard.
[29:06.86]Look at how much I'm getting hit right now.
[29:08.68]I've taken more punches in the last 10 seconds than the last 40 minutes playing this game.
[29:20.55]It's just a rhythm game.
[29:21.31]It's like playing Rhythm Heaven.
[29:31.58]God damn it.
[29:37.12]It's that little left jab, a right jab.
[29:39.12]It's just... Alright, how do I block that?
[29:50.75]Maybe just don't move?
[29:52.96]That's what it is.
[29:53.50]Okay, you just don't move.
[30:04.24]Shit.
[30:11.37]Alright.
[30:12.01]So, the reason why I did that, because if you lose, if you actually get a loss, you are 100% locked out of doing the final circuit.
[30:23.42]Ever.
[30:24.12]You have to beat every single enemy.
[30:26.96]You have to do every single fight without losing.
[30:29.88]It's the only way you can get the last actual circuit.
[30:36.24]Oh my god, that was really bad from the last time.
[30:44.07]So now special circuit is open.
[30:49.09]Now, the reason why I said I could get to here without being downed.
[30:53.46]Didn't really age well when I said that.
[30:58.10]Because that didn't happen.
[31:00.99]Okay, so, uh, but I get to do this now, and this is impossible.
[31:03.85]This is actually, like, almost impossible.
[31:05.55]This is very, very, very hard.
[31:07.71]Actually, when I was a kid, uh, I only saw this one time.
[31:13.17]I've never actually truly played through this part, except I did in more recent years.
[31:19.33]But when I was younger and I played this all the time, it was rare to even get here.
[31:23.02]Because remember, I didn't have a save state.
[31:25.90]I do remember this is a really cool fight, though, because, you'll see.
[31:35.23]Watch this.
[31:37.58]He doesn't want you to do something very in particular.
[31:39.68]That.
[31:44.34]You can't hit him in the face until he gets angry.
[31:47.29]Then he loses composure.
[31:49.43]And he gets mad at Calamity Ganon.
[31:52.53]And you will see.
[32:03.02]Yeah, my experience with this guy is... I think I've seen this guy twice ever.
[32:08.50]Let's do it.
[32:09.10]Even if I cheat, I don't care.
[32:10.02]Let's see the whole thing.
[32:13.91]Alright, no more talking because I can't play video games and talk at the same time.
[32:28.99]That was weird.
[32:39.41]Okay, we're good.
[32:41.01]Those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, while you're playing the next game that you play, that's really like kind of a hard game we have to pay attention.
[32:49.57]Just start talking out loud.
[32:51.21]You're going to get killed.
[32:52.57]You'll get hit like by everything that the monster does.
[33:09.36]Alright, good.
[33:16.87]I forget what's after this guy.
[33:23.01]Ow.
[33:25.41]Well, that was a cool move.
[33:40.23]I can only hit him once here?
[33:41.43]Come on, what is this?
[33:42.19]There we go.
[33:46.43]The next boss is so hard.
[33:47.73]I forget who it is.
[33:48.57]Why do I not remember?
[33:50.55]Well, let's see it.
[34:08.17]Cool.
[34:12.82]I'm not even on here.
[34:17.78]I'm not on here.
[34:18.98]I must not have done it.
[34:22.67]Okay.
[34:22.85]Please take it easy on a poor old man.
[34:34.14]What the fuck was that?
[34:36.78]Okay.
[34:44.00]Oh my goodness.
[34:46.26]You have to hit him on opposites.
[34:49.40]Wow.
[34:50.18]Goodbye.
[34:50.86]That was ugly.
[34:59.37]So you have to alternate.
[35:00.33]I think maybe I can stand still for that.
[35:05.75]Jeez.
[35:06.59]Duck maybe?
[35:07.13]I can only do it twice.
[35:12.78]What about... Hold on.
[35:13.92]Let me get that down.
[35:14.64]What is this?
[35:15.52]Is it up?
[35:16.76]One, two, three.
[35:17.96]Sideways.
[35:18.46]Okay.
[35:18.68]That's one, two, three, sideways.
[35:19.74]Goodness.
[35:22.52]Jesus.
[35:37.18]Only two.
[35:41.04]Wow, that kick hurts a lot.
[35:47.38]Can you imagine having to go through the entire game and not lose?
[35:51.58]And then get to this guy and win.
[35:53.55]Or you have to do the whole thing all over again.
[35:59.73]Oh my god.
[36:11.67]The movements are really erratic too.
[36:13.05]Plus him having a cane, it's kind of like, it's hard to tell when he's going to swing or punch.
[36:19.14]But let's see what we can do.
[36:25.48]Ooh, I had power there.
[36:30.09]No, I want to get that.
[36:47.78]You know, I don't think I've ever seen the end of this game.
[36:52.44]Who's at the end?
[36:53.62]I'm really curious now, actually.
[36:55.18]What the fuck?
[37:18.84]Okay, well, this is the first time I've downed him.
[37:25.46]That's good, at least.
[37:36.72]I can get downed once.
[37:37.62]I should do it for the health anyways.
[37:41.68]All right.
[37:50.95]this guy's gonna have to play so much zelda god damn it man I don't even know how you would memorize this even playing here normally jesus that's a good opportunity I'm gonna take it
[38:23.36]That's a good opportunity to hit.
[38:31.20]No, no, no, no.
[38:32.38]That does not count.
[38:33.62]That doesn't count either.
[38:34.34]Doesn't count either.
[38:55.46]That was greedy.
[38:56.04]That was stupid.
[38:59.62]Good.
[39:12.65]So it's up, up, down, down.
[39:17.41]Let me see the whole thing.
[39:18.91]Up, up, up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, down.
[39:22.44]Okay.
[39:31.58]That didn't count.
[39:39.29]Now I know why I've never seen what's after this guy.
[39:42.32]Because I definitely got here.
[39:43.46]Even while cheating, I probably was like, nah, fuck this.
[39:45.46]I'd rather go eat like a sandwich or something.
[40:01.99]Okay, I can end it right here.
[40:05.05]Let's go.
[40:05.51]I've never seen this before.
[40:07.21]Yeah.
[40:10.90]I physically don't even know what the next fighter is.
[40:17.82]If you had IRL safe dates, what would you try to master?
[40:20.36]A professional sport?
[40:24.57]Definitely something with repetition.
[40:27.09]Not something with pure physical strength.
[40:33.81]Hmm.
[40:38.46]What physical sport?
[40:40.50]What could I... I don't know.
[40:44.32]Rick Bruiser.
[40:47.54]My brother may be champ, but only because I let him win.
[40:50.93]Really, I am the best.
[40:56.15]I have seen this before.
[40:57.29]How come I don't remember?
[41:03.27]Okay, I'm going to concentrate.
[41:13.50]That's weird.
[41:13.86]I don't like it.
[41:14.32]Okay, I guess I have to hit him in the stomach there.
[41:21.86]That was a counterattack.
[41:26.85]Whoa, no, it's an elbow.
[41:28.89]Wait, let's go all the way back.
[41:34.49]Shit.
[41:38.32]God damn it.
[41:41.22]I'm doing alright starting out.
[41:49.67]Woah, jeez.
[41:55.13]Wait.
[42:09.54]Oh, the counterattack.
[42:10.38]He does it every time.
[42:22.92]Oh, come on, dude!
[42:24.06]Stop!
[42:27.36]It's up, down... Hold on.
[42:31.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[42:32.52]Your brain just wants to dodge so bad.
[42:34.42]It's don't move, and then up, and then left.
[42:37.84]Okay, don't move, up, left.
[42:42.11]And then no punch?
[42:44.54]Is it the same?
[42:45.10]No?
[42:45.30]It's up, up, down.
[42:49.72]Up, up.
[42:51.56]Why'd you dodge?
[42:53.26]Up, up, down.
[42:54.22]Okay.
[42:56.04]Up, left.
[42:57.98]Fuck, I forgot he does that again.
[43:11.67]This guy's ridiculous.
[43:18.40]Sit down.
[43:24.24]Is that the first down or the second?
[43:40.98]Imagine saves coming this much.
[43:44.38]Okay, so that one's down, up, down.
[43:48.82]What?
[43:49.28]Oh no, it's down, up, left.
[43:57.04]I wonder how many kids cried playing this.
[43:58.82]Like, you have to have cried.
[44:01.65]You have to have cried, right?
[44:03.11]Like, I probably cried.
[44:04.39]Yeah, I had to have cried.
[44:18.31]Oh, that's a wanted kill.
[44:37.08]Ow!
[44:37.78]I forgot again.
[44:39.27]I'm just trying not to get hit so bad.
[44:43.29]Shit.
[45:05.58]Up, down, left?
[45:10.89]No, it's down, up.
[45:12.03]Down, up, left.
[45:14.41]Oh my goodness gracious.
[45:20.54]Even when you know it too.
[45:26.76]I tried to dodge it.
[45:27.74]It's like a half second window.
[45:28.86]I tried to dodge it again.
[45:34.60]No, no, no, no.
[45:37.15]Go back.
[45:44.89]I made it worse somehow.
[45:45.81]How did I just make it worse?
[45:54.11]Oh, he can hit you on the way down, too.
[46:06.02]Ugh.
[46:06.46]It's like fighting Margit for the first time.
[46:08.90]You know, it's like, here comes the sweat!
[46:10.34]You're dead.
[46:12.40]Only thing is, I can't do this at Margit.
[46:26.22]Alright, we need to go way back, so before this is all completely collapsed.
[46:29.46]There we go.
[46:31.27]Can I block it?
[46:37.51]Let me see if I can block it up.
[46:41.43]No, I can't.
[46:41.97]There we go.
[46:50.19]Tried to dodge it too.
[46:50.97]Alright, let's see what happens.
[46:54.63]I've never seen this before.
[47:00.72]This isn't a challenge anymore?
[47:01.88]Well no, I mean this is... This is content I've never seen before.
[47:17.87]So what's after this?
[47:20.67]Oh no.
[47:22.95]It's just hard mode.
[47:26.82]Uh...
[47:36.03]Even with superpowers, I still think I don't think I can beat him.
[47:38.83]Can you imagine that?
[47:41.15]Imagine having save states, a magical power, and you still can't beat this guy.
[47:49.28]It's so quick.
[47:51.36]No way.
[47:53.44]Oh my god.
[47:54.18]Okay.
[47:57.98]You have to alternate?
[48:06.67]He just broke my hand.
[48:19.59]Running a save state is actually really tricky because you're just not ready to fight.
[48:25.60]There's no rhythm with a save state.
[48:27.72]Okay, so he breaks your hand if you punch him in the stomach, so don't do that.
[48:40.17]Holy shit, that was immediate, whatever it was.
[48:43.35]It's, ugh.
[48:52.82]Do it.
[48:54.16]Wow.
[48:55.00]Whoa, he does two, okay, double follow up.
[49:18.17]Jeez.
[49:19.77]Oh, how can I not?
[49:20.83]How did I not hit him?
[49:23.01]There's so much mix up here.
[49:34.13]Oh my God, he dodged it.
[49:37.49]What the fuck does that mean?
[49:44.21]Left, up, down.
[49:47.47]Left, down.
[49:48.05]Up?
[50:03.21]No, it's down, up, down, up, down, up, left, down, up, right, down, down.
[50:10.41]Down?
[50:11.55]Okay.
[50:12.68]Down, up, left.
[50:15.18]Up, down, left.
[50:16.82]Holy shit, dude.
[50:18.36]No kids beat this.
[50:25.61]Up.
[50:26.77]Up.
[50:27.41]No, it's different.
[50:28.35]He changes it every time.
[50:32.09]I'm done.
[50:32.77]That was fun.
[50:35.37]That was fun in one.
[50:36.36]I'm, uh,
[50:39.05]I mean, at this point, I'm just literally going to be saving state after every punch.
[50:46.20]And that's not even going to help.
[50:56.81]It changes every time, it looks like.
[50:58.19]You can't hit him in the middle of this.
[51:03.81]Fuck.
[51:04.77]Fuck.
[51:08.28]Can't even win with cheating.
[51:09.60]That's how you know this is unbelievable.
[51:15.22]He just swings so often that if you're not in the rhythm, it's impossible.
[51:20.81]Down, up, left, up, down, left.
[51:25.61]No, I'm done.
[51:26.45]I'm going to play Gold Dive for fucking an hour.
[51:38.22]Okay.
[51:38.96]Down.
[51:39.72]Up.
[51:40.32]Left.
[51:40.98]Da- Does it change?
[51:43.71]I feel like I can't even process that he's doing anything.
[51:46.21]Down.
[51:46.99]Up.
[51:47.59]Left.
[51:48.33]Up.
[51:48.73]Down.
[51:57.29]He keeps going.
[52:01.31]Holy shit.
[52:04.86]Alright.
[52:10.22]Watch a YouTube video if you want to see the rest.
[52:12.32]I'm not doing this anymore.
[52:14.18]That was cool.
[52:14.78]It's cool to see this other guy for the first time ever.
[52:20.89]This is fun.
[52:22.43]Let's play Goldeneye.
[52:27.41]I mean, you want to do the guy that's designed for you to take like $75 in quarters from you at the arcade?
[52:33.94]I don't believe so.
[52:37.02]Imagine, okay, think of me putting quarters in.
[52:39.10]I just put in a quarter right now.
[52:47.46]By the way, I don't think there even was quarters.
[52:49.02]This is the Super Nintendo version.
[52:54.96]The arcade version was back in the regular Nintendo era.
[52:57.04]Yeah, that's my golden eye.
[53:02.40]That was fun.
[53:06.12]I am not doing that.
[53:11.40]I want to play one level in Goldeneye that I remember.
[53:20.23]The arcade version was a different game.
[53:21.41]Yeah, but it came out around the same era as the NES one, right?
[53:25.99]Is that what I remember?
[53:28.41]I want to play Goldeneye.
[53:30.79]I want to get to level two.
[53:34.03]I'm not going to play this for very long.
[53:35.07]I just want to do it.
[53:45.91]Oh, shit.
[53:48.05]Okay, here we go.
[53:49.69]Click mission.
[53:50.87]Damn.
[53:51.33]Alright, I'm going to do secret agent.
[53:53.36]Neutralize all alarms and bungee jump off the platform.
[53:56.18]Okay.
[54:08.21]You guys remember this game?
[54:09.03]I remember this game.
[54:11.33]Cool.
[54:12.43]Anything else?
[54:13.03]Nah, that's it.
[54:14.67]I just remember it.
[54:15.37]Do you?
[54:15.97]Yeah.
[54:16.25]Alright, good.
[54:20.41]So, Goldeneye... This game auto-aims?
[54:25.73]I don't know... Whoa, wait a sec.
[54:31.84]Okay, so it's left and right.
[54:34.96]Left and right.
[54:36.44]The right... Okay, that's inverted.
[54:38.42]We are not doing that.
[54:41.95]We are not doing that.
[54:46.83]Can this be changed?
[54:51.49]Okay, there we go.
[54:55.19]Upright is fine.
[54:56.23]Auto aim is on.
[54:57.13]Aim control, I'm going to say hold is fine.
[54:59.17]Okay.
[55:04.16]Already people attacking me?
[55:05.02]How do you shoot?
[55:12.44]This guy sucks at shooting.
[55:21.69]I love the death sounds.
[55:24.09]That like... Alright, it's left trigger to shoot.
[55:33.83]I think it's... How do you change weapons?
[55:41.92]There we go.
[55:43.16]Okay.
[55:48.88]Alright, we're doing fine.
[55:52.73]The pencil?
[55:53.29]No, that's the Duracell battery.
[55:58.13]That's the double packet of AA batteries.
[56:04.99]Okay, was anything up here?
[56:05.81]Isn't there body armor or something here?
[56:07.67]Oh, yep.
[56:07.97]Give me that.
[56:09.58]Sniper rifle.
[56:14.24]Get out of here.
[56:18.90]Yep, there's a wall in front of me.
[56:20.65]Where is the glass?
[56:22.69]What?
[56:23.09]There's no jump, right?
[56:39.50]This game, I forgot how weirdly this game was controlled.
[56:41.75]Alright, here we go.
[56:45.15]So, left right bumper, and then left stick, and then left trigger.
[56:50.75]It's like the opposite of what a game controls like nowadays.
[56:53.67]Alright, get him.
[57:05.35]Grandma put on the VR helmet for the first time ever.
[57:30.80]OK.
[57:30.98]Give me the other gun.
[57:32.12]Yeah, no, no, this thing.
[57:43.94]Nothing up there.
[57:46.94]That was a really fast sniper.
[57:48.12]Yeah, it was kind of semi automatic.
[57:54.33]I'm dizzy.
[57:57.03]Yeah, me too.
[58:02.91]But we'll be alright.
[58:03.41]I have to press this button.
[58:12.86]You have to do a bunch of control changes in the menu to make it feel more modern.
[58:25.99]I don't mind it.
[58:26.45]I can get used to it.
[58:27.01]It's going to take a minute or two.
[58:43.92]Nice roll.
[58:51.87]Can't you change this game to be widescreen?
[58:55.99]Oh, great.
[59:09.69]Why are they not aiming at me?
[59:13.73]Okay, we're good.
[59:33.62]Ooh, what's this?
[59:34.18]Open that up.
[59:36.28]Can I?
[59:40.19]I just want to do the facility.
[59:41.11]That's the only one I want to play.
[59:55.43]Open?
[59:58.69]The facility is the best level in the whole game.
[60:01.83]Especially on multiplayer.
[60:19.81]This is so epic.
[60:20.91]Hey, I'll be honest with you, though.
[60:24.13]I'll show my age here a little bit here.
[60:25.42]This was the coolest thing to ever come out in like 30 years.
[60:29.94]This was my Fortnite, guys.
[60:33.17]This is the shit that I played when I was like 12, 13, 14.
[60:51.26]I am holding, I'm moving the right stick, which is, that's just burned in your brain permanently.
[61:02.60]It was something else.
[61:03.36]Oh yeah.
[61:07.50]Imagine sitting around, let me paint a picture for you.
[61:11.03]Imagine sitting around a square, like 19 inch square television.
[61:19.67]with four people huddled around it.
[61:22.86]Four split-screen player co-op.
[61:26.92]You had the amount of viewing angle that is on an iPhone right now.
[61:37.76]And we loved every second of it.
[61:56.17]Is there anybody in here?
[61:57.63]Are you gonna play Lies of Pi?
[62:01.35]Umm... Probably not.
[62:05.30]At least not immediately.
[62:06.32]Whoa!
[62:08.62]Who is... From all the way down... Okay, I'm just gonna leave that guy.
[62:32.56]Ow.
[62:35.48]Enough of the explosion.
[62:38.24]I might not even get through this level.
[62:39.46]I'm in trouble.
[62:49.95]This is the end coming up right here, right?
[62:54.51]There are no save rewinds in this game.
[63:01.94]Although I could do this.
[63:04.94]Wait, how do I get to it?
[63:11.05]We're cheating.
[63:11.73]Alright.
[63:26.33]I just want to do the first part of the facility.
[63:28.89]That's it.
[63:34.47]I didn't win.
[63:35.89]Um... What is the... There's like a side... Where do I go?
[63:40.11]I remember... There's like a boat.
[63:49.06]Oh, yeah, you go this way.
[63:50.24]Honestly, VR controls would be easier.
[64:08.78]Wait, where is it?
[64:12.89]Mission status incomplete.
[64:14.17]No.
[64:15.49]Oh, is it because I did the secret agent mode?
[64:20.27]Do I have to complete everything?
[64:30.08]Other side.
[64:36.00]Down here.
[64:42.15]Just jump off the first tower?
[64:43.33]Why don't you jump off the dam?
[64:50.59]Oh my goodness.
[64:53.80]Yeah, holding right stick left and not moving left is like... I may as well be playing backwards.
[65:13.76]Can I get out of here?
[65:14.56]This is from all the very first tower.
[65:17.71]You actually don't have to come all the way down here.
[65:19.19]It's been a very long time.
[65:20.63]Ooh, what's that?
[65:21.11]It's on the other side.
[65:34.62]Wait.
[65:37.18]Fake fan?
[65:39.42]Yeah, let me go wake up Jeremy from when he was 17.
[65:42.48]And be like, hey dude, why the fuck don't you remember this?
[65:46.91]Hey, you were 14 25 years ago.
[65:49.93]Why don't you remember where the bungee jump is, stupid?
[65:55.65]I'll go tell him.
[65:56.47]I'm gonna go tell him.
[65:59.21]Yeah, I'm gonna tell him right now.
[66:12.88]Okay, this is the level I actually wanted to play.
[66:16.44]Oh, god damn it.
[66:18.88]Do I actually have to do it again?
[66:19.94]Because you have to destroy if you can't just beat it.
[66:27.20]That's why you only... That's why you don't do secret agent first.
[66:30.08]That's what he told him.
[66:32.96]Check this out.
[66:45.01]He didn't pull the chute.
[67:09.05]I just want to do the thing in the facility.
[67:10.89]It's my favorite level.
[67:35.57]Alright, come down.
[67:45.27]Oh, don't press that.
[67:45.99]That's the alarm.
[67:55.32]Give me that thing.
[67:56.82]I know this thing is good.
[67:57.78]I remember using it.
[67:59.24]Nope.
[67:59.96]There it is.
[68:00.70]I love this weapon.
[68:01.52]It's like the best weapon.
[68:03.22]When you get two of these, it's so fun.
[68:11.77]All right, here we go.
[68:34.88]Hey, there it is.
[68:54.57]Alright, best level in the game.
[68:55.45]Let's go.
[69:03.62]So you can really mess this up a million different ways.
[69:07.96]I will see how well I do this.
[69:13.44]But I remember this in particular doing multiplayer when you got to be up here.
[69:18.82]Hiding in the bathroom was always the most fun thing ever.
[69:22.94]Because in multiplayer,
[69:25.22]Yeah, you could screen cheat, but come on in.
[69:27.44]Yeah, come and get me.
[69:29.50]I know you're going to open that door.
[69:30.50]And then you... And then all of a sudden you see a proximity mine get thrown up at you.
[69:38.45]Yeah, come on.
[69:39.91]Get the guy that's over here.
[69:44.97]I remember hiding up here with the golden gun.
[69:48.11]And you were just unbeatable.
[69:52.20]The golden gun killed any... Okay, here we go.
[69:54.52]Let's have some fun.
[70:03.23]He's so shit-faced.
[70:04.87]It's so hard to control this.
[70:08.01]How do I detonate them?
[70:10.99]Not like that.
[70:12.87]How do you detonate?
[70:14.65]I don't know.
[70:19.42]Isn't it... It's like a different item, isn't it?
[70:22.69]Yeah, it's this one.
[70:34.89]Oh.
[70:41.09]Isn't there something in one of these?
[70:42.12]Like there's something in right here.
[70:52.32]Okay, the whole goal with this is you're supposed to get down here.
[70:55.84]You have to press a bunch of buttons and shit.
[70:57.68]And then you have to get through and find one of the scientists.
[71:00.26]I don't know.
[71:00.62]Let's just fucking go.
[71:20.47]Can we open this?
[71:37.10]Alright, we have to do this quick.
[71:41.28]Body armor, looks good.
[71:46.52]We made it through here.
[71:55.49]Why does it explode for 10 seconds?
[71:56.97]Yeah, the after explosion is huge.
[72:01.35]Alright, now this part's important.
[72:02.57]I remember this.
[72:04.41]You!
[72:05.09]I think I need your keycard.
[72:09.28]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[72:10.42]How do I?
[72:12.08]I need the key card.
[72:20.62]Doesn't he have a key card?
[72:28.37]Oh.
[72:31.01]The other doctor.
[72:38.24]That one right there.
[72:39.80]OK.
[72:52.01]Huh?
[72:58.77]Don't you?
[72:59.01]Where do you get a key card?
[73:24.13]You don't need the key card on this difficulty.
[73:26.55]Oh, OK.
[73:34.31]I'm going to do this because I feel like it's very necessary.
[73:40.16]OK.
[73:46.42]OK, now.
[73:49.10]Can I get the key card?
[73:57.59]OK.
[73:59.59]Yeah, there's a named character that's in this level somewhere.
[74:09.51]Wait, where are you guys going?
[74:27.31]Holy shit, that's a lot of people.
[74:44.80]Oh.
[75:00.99]Good.
[75:04.11]Turn on paintball mode.
[75:05.08]There's a ton of random cheats you can do.
[75:06.42]I think you have to beat the game on certain difficulties to unlock them though, right?
[75:19.10]Alright, I'm gonna save it here.
[75:28.35]Oh boy.
[75:37.12]Um... Oh no.
[75:41.66]Keep this out.
[75:45.77]All right, so there is a lot of people here.
[75:51.07]Where are you?
[75:53.92]I think one of these guys has something that I need.
[75:58.82]You guys have something?
[76:00.58]Anybody have a key card?
[76:10.29]Come on.
[76:15.82]Uh, all right.
[76:16.32]Well, at least I saved it.
[76:36.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[76:41.08]I'm going to stay right here.
[76:46.48]Just for a second.
[76:56.90]Not you.
[77:00.50]There we are.
[77:01.04]Hey, what's up?
[77:02.01]Time to leave, Dr. Doak.
[77:07.17]You'll need the decoder to open the bottling room door.
[77:10.13]Good luck.
[77:11.81]Okay, did he just give it to me?
[77:21.33]Cool.
[77:22.41]Alright.
[77:34.50]I think there's a cutscene here.
[77:41.03]I have to save points right here.
[77:41.89]We'll be fine.
[77:50.91]Oh my goodness, go in the door.
[77:58.57]OK.
[77:59.37]Not supposed to kill that guy.
[78:25.54]If only you knew.
[78:26.54]If only you knew.
[78:27.90]If only you knew.
[78:40.92]For England.
[78:42.87]James?
[78:45.31]For England.
[78:47.63]Alec?
[78:49.23]I almost killed myself getting here, Alec.
[78:54.23]Half of everything is luck.
[78:58.94]And the other half?
[79:01.42]Pure skill.
[79:03.97]Wait.
[79:07.73]I'm a fucking secret devil agent.
[79:33.20]Oh, I have to destroy all those.
[79:34.24]Do I need the cutscene first?
[80:15.45]All right, let's go.
[80:35.26]Yeah, I know for England.
[80:36.96]All right, let's go.
[80:37.86]Come on.
[80:55.90]For England, James.
[80:57.02]Yes, for England.
[80:59.02]Completed.
[80:59.52]Are they all just... Get out of the fucking way!
[81:33.24]Where?
[81:35.08]Okay.
[81:35.40]It's shit-faced VR, honestly.
[81:45.43]Okay, I'm going to attack.
[81:55.04]Sorry, kill.
[81:55.82]Let's save it right here.
[82:11.16]You fucking idiot.
[82:12.44]Oh my god.
[82:13.32]I lose.
[82:26.59]Can I come over here so I can detonate this and not get in trouble?
[82:31.45]Don't... I can't help that he's stupid.
[82:35.52]How am I supposed to solve that?
[83:04.07]I gotta get all of these.
[83:04.93]I almost have it.
[83:21.83]Bro-
[83:38.20]Dude, how do you beat this?
[83:39.83]I don't remember being that hard.
[83:45.91]You need to get out of the way.
[83:47.47]Two.
[83:54.78]Three.
[83:58.49]Four.
[84:10.26]Fuck them, who cares?
[84:11.02]I got it.
[84:24.49]Yeah, I did it.
[84:25.59]Alright, that's all I wanted to do.
[84:28.25]That was fun, though.
[84:40.00]Yeah, that's probably gonna wrap it up.
[84:41.00]I just wanted to do a couple of these goofy dumb things.
[84:53.42]What about F-Zero?
[84:55.46]What's that?
[84:55.78]F-Zero 99.
[84:58.69]What's F-Zero 99?
[84:59.35]F-Zero 99.
[85:10.26]Is it new?
[85:11.66]It's a free thing on the Switch?
[85:26.21]I just don't... I just don't understand!
[85:30.58]Dad, stop.
[85:31.76]Dad, just start at the beginning.
[85:33.04]Start at the beginning.
[85:35.24]Son, I can't fucking shoot that thing.
[85:37.06]Why not?
[85:37.47]That's ridiculous.
[85:38.95]This game's terrible.
[85:40.99]Dad, you just didn't shoot it.
[85:43.71]That thing can't even take damage, Dad.
[85:46.85]Why not?
[85:47.29]I should have programmed that in.
[85:49.17]I don't understand this.
[85:53.24]Is that what it's like for you guys?
[85:58.28]I have a feeling it is.
[86:08.10]Okay, that was fun.
[86:11.54]F099.
[86:11.60]Where do I get it?
[86:12.34]Hold on.
[86:12.58]Can I just get it here?
[86:13.29]Should I do it once?
[86:16.59]Where do I go?
[86:17.03]It's just free on the shop.
[86:24.37]Okay.
[86:26.69]I'll get it.
[86:33.39]Free on the shop.
[86:36.78]Is it featured or where would it be?
[86:51.99]Oh, there it is.
[86:52.57]F-Zero 99.
[86:53.05]Okay.
[86:53.33]Yeah, I'll do one.
[86:58.57]Lightning fast F-Zero racing with 99 players.
[87:01.52]Wow, that actually seems really fun.
[87:03.18]Yeah, 100%.
[87:06.27]It's a free download, sure.
[87:20.30]So this kind of works like I'm matching Pac-Man 99 and Tetris 99.
[87:26.46]Okay, that's right.
[87:27.32]That sounds fun.
[87:30.10]Let me go pee one more time.
[87:35.24]I know I'm getting to the end, but I'm going to pee.
[87:37.12]I have to download it anyway, so be right back.
