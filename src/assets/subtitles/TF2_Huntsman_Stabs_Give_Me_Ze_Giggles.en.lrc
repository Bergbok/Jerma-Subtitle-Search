[00:09.93]Not on my watch.
[00:11.35]Not on my watch.
[00:15.54]I got him.
[00:16.46]What the?
[00:16.94]What the hell just happened?
[00:18.74]What just happened?
[00:20.96]Why did he not die?
[00:22.78]What?
[00:24.16]What is going on right now, man?
[00:32.10]Alright.
[00:32.78]Time to make things interesting.
[00:34.28]Stipulation for this life is I gotta get three headshots in a row.
[00:38.82]If I don't get three headshots in a row, then my fucking computer explodes.
[00:43.54]Alright, guys?
[00:44.20]Here we go.
[00:46.26]There's one.
[00:47.16]There's one, baby.
[00:48.54]We're gonna get two?
[00:49.08]No, it's alright.
[00:51.46]As long as I don't hit them.
[00:53.43]There's two.
[00:54.07]There's two.
[00:54.43]Alright.
[00:54.71]Looking good.
[00:55.09]Looking good.
[00:55.93]Looking good.
[00:57.71]And there's three.
[00:59.51]No, no, no.
[01:00.01]Wait, wait.
[01:00.33]Double it up.
[01:04.25]Just be quiet about it.
[01:06.23]Don't let anybody know you're there.
[01:07.75]Holy shit.
[01:09.79]You just got knocked so far in the air, my man.
[01:15.39]I'm up in their little base.
[01:16.93]I'm up in their area.
[01:19.31]Now it's just a matter of time before I can catch somebody.
[01:23.47]Right?
[01:26.16]Peek around the corner.
[01:27.70]Nobody coming?
[01:29.80]I don't want a sniper to come in front.
[01:31.44]I don't want them to see me.
[01:33.11]Right?
[01:33.43]I need to be like... Okay, okay, here's the sniper.
[01:36.47]He just saw me, but he's not gonna know I'm here.
[01:41.27]He didn't even get me!
[01:44.49]He didn't even... You saw it!
[01:46.01]He didn't even get me!
[01:46.98]He hit the wall behind him!
[01:49.26]He hit the wall behind him!
[01:52.48]Same deal.
[01:54.06]This time, I'm getting this guy.
[01:59.26]I'll take you!
[02:02.47]What the hell are you doing?
[02:03.41]What's this guy doing?
[02:04.37]Why is he... What is this guy doing?
[02:07.35]Did I just really do that?
[02:09.51]I... I didn't just really do that, did I?
[02:12.73]Am I... Am I in a dream?
[02:15.31]Pinch me.
[02:16.37]Somebody wake me up.
[02:19.48]Okay, well.
[02:20.66]I'll take it.
[02:22.02]I'm waiting for him.
[02:23.94]You see, this guy... This guy's gonna get it.
[02:27.98]This guy's gonna get it.
[02:29.22]There he is again.
[02:30.42]It's the same Pyro.
[02:31.64]Isn't it?
[02:33.31]Is it the same Pyro?
[02:34.05]I don't know what the hell he's doing.
[02:37.81]He's just chilling out.
[02:38.93]And now he's gone.
[02:39.97]What is he... What?
[02:46.74]Because remember, nobody besides a scout ever goes around this side.
[02:51.24]Just wrap around.
[02:51.78]See?
[02:52.12]It's all scouts.
[02:53.12]And this one sniper.
[02:55.84]You know, it's all scouts.
[02:57.82]Accidental!
[02:59.70]Whoopsie!
[03:02.21]I didn't mean to...
[03:11.87]Let's move on.
[03:15.05]No!
[03:16.35]He fucked up.
[03:18.23]What?
[03:18.93]What is... What?
[03:23.48]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[03:28.60]You're gonna see a taunt kill like you've never seen before.
[03:34.13]This guy is a spy.
[03:35.59]This spy has no idea that I know he's a spy.
[03:37.77]Are you kidding me?
[03:38.95]Please tell me I got him.
[03:40.31]Oh my god.
[03:44.33]Oh no.
[03:48.40]I love how he cloaked.
[03:50.60]He saw me coming and he realized I knew he was a spy and he was like, oh wait, no, you can't see me.
[03:55.66]He was still in the same spot though.
[03:57.96]Here he is again.
[04:02.27]My... goodness.
[04:05.36]Oh my goodness.
[04:08.48]This time, hopefully nothing screws up.
[04:12.42]Line it up.
[04:13.42]For when this scout comes up the stairs, he is gonna wish he was never born.
[04:19.56]I mistimed it.
[04:20.44]It's okay.
[04:22.26]It's alright.
[04:23.88]It's alright, we can hand the shit out of this guy.
[04:26.72]He doesn't want none.
[04:27.63]He wants none.
[04:29.91]Oh, he don't want none of that.
[04:30.97]He doesn't want none of that.
[04:31.90]Let's go.
[04:35.28]Sniper.
[04:36.16]Oblivious sniper.
[04:37.54]Oblivious!
[04:40.13]Alright, guys.
[04:42.55]It's time to, uh, time to call my shots.
[04:44.49]Like the good old Babe.
[04:45.65]Babe Ruth.
[04:47.35]No, no, we're not talking about the candy bar, not Baby Ruth, we're talking about Babe Ruth, the legend, the master of the diamond cutter.
[04:56.46]Babe Ruth used to call his shots.
[04:58.08]See, I, I, shoot the spy in the face, called it.
[05:01.28]What the fuck is a sentry doing out here on our side?
[05:06.98]You know the drill.
[05:08.44]Second those Span doors open, it's time to rocket.
[05:12.16]You ready?
[05:12.62]Make sure I get my ammo.
[05:13.58]Span doors are gonna open.
[05:14.52]Span doors are now closing.
[05:16.62]It's time to turn it on, guys.
[05:17.82]You know how we do here.
[05:19.60]You know how we do here.
[05:22.02]Gonna get at least five kills in a row right here.
[05:25.49]I ain't messing around.
[05:26.97]It's one.
[05:28.69]I told you.
[05:29.15]I told you right when those Span doors closed.
[05:32.65]You ain't messing around with me now.
[05:35.04]I got really mad right there.
[05:37.68]Spandaur.
[05:38.38]That was a pretty good span shot.
[05:40.56]That's what we're talking about here, guys.
[05:42.50]That's two.
[05:44.36]Ready for this one?
[05:47.08]Yeah.
[05:47.90]I got you.
[05:48.62]I got you.
[05:49.77]It's three.
[05:51.81]No!
[05:52.11]No!
[05:52.31]I'm in front of the pyros!
[05:56.87]Close the spandaur.
