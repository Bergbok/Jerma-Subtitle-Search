[00:08.42]Somebody said, who's your favorite Vocaloid?
[00:14.19]I don't know.
[00:14.59]I didn't know there was that many.
[00:25.25]You done peeing?
[00:25.85]Yeah.
[00:26.89]I am done peeing.
[00:28.62]You guys ready for Pac-Man Museum?
[00:30.12]I'm going to turn it down.
[00:33.10]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[00:33.88]I don't even know what this is.
[00:42.10]We're about to find out.
[00:50.69]Yep.
[00:52.15]Alright, let me capture this.
[00:56.72]Max FPS.
[00:58.76]No, that's fine.
[01:03.56]That's fine.
[01:05.63]Borderless window, yep.
[01:10.73]Okay, it's very loud.
[01:12.03]Let me turn this down first.
[01:15.45]I actually can't turn it down.
[01:17.46]I have to go to the source here.
[01:18.54]Alright, let's get back.
[01:26.12]You can't see it yet, but you will in a minute.
[01:37.39]Just putting it together.
[01:44.01]Hackman.
[01:46.37]Where are you?
[01:47.79]There you are.
[01:57.69]Alright.
[02:00.91]So let's go.
[02:07.64]What are they doing?
[02:12.40]What the fuck is going on?
[02:20.77]Alright.
[02:22.79]Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Arcade.
[02:26.01]In this arcade you can choose coins to play a variety of Pac-Man- Oh, shut them all- Everybody shut up!
[02:33.61]Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Plus.
[02:34.77]In this arcade you can use coins to play a variety of Pac-Man games.
[02:39.48]When you want to play a game, move in front of it and select play.
[02:41.44]The game will start.
[02:42.16]While in the arcade, press Y to open the menu.
[02:55.27]Okay.
[02:55.97]Okay.
[02:57.09]Okay.
[02:58.24]Okay.
[03:00.76]This place is fucking annoying.
[03:06.38]I wouldn't want to be in here for more than five minutes.
[03:11.56]Alright, what do they have for machines?
[03:14.80]Gashapon?
[03:17.40]Spend coins on the Gashapon to get you- I don't know how you- Is it supposed to sound- Is it supposed to sound like this?
[03:40.00]I gotta get out of here.
[03:43.16]Alright, Pac-Man, Pac-Mania!
[03:51.99]Huh?
[03:59.98]Okay, I was gonna say I thought it was gonna be that small.
[04:10.66]Let's get a few extra lives.
[04:21.69]It sounds like Miku.
[04:27.86]It does.
[04:28.50]This sounds like Miku.
[04:36.91]I can't escape that game.
[04:46.55]It really sounds like Miku.
[04:49.06]I feel like my voice has changed in the last hour.
[04:51.38]Got him.
[05:23.14]Come on Gwen!
[05:25.30]Come on Gwen!
[05:55.58]You can jump?
[05:58.72]What?
[05:59.08]I didn't know you could jump.
[06:07.53]I'm never gonna get caught by a ghost ever again.
[06:24.20]One.
[06:25.21]Two.
[06:26.13]Three.
[06:27.51]Four.
[07:50.66]Oh, we get a cutscene.
[08:03.37]This is the best song.
[08:04.97]This is the best song they've ever made.
[08:17.41]Um
[08:47.84]What the fuck was that double bounce?
[09:19.70]Screen settings?
[09:22.28]No, I don't want CRT.
[09:24.93]I want the bigger screen, though.
[09:28.51]But that's better.
[09:49.89]Are you okay?
[09:50.63]Yeah!
[09:51.09]I wasn't looking.
[09:52.15]I wasn't looking.
[09:53.38]That's fine, alright, it doesn't matter.
[09:55.02]I got four stau- I got four coins.
[09:56.40]That's it?
[10:25.50]I unlocked Pac-Mania cabinet.
[10:27.48]A gold container.
[10:28.30]A... Okay, you get to... Please.
[10:33.11]I got a cabinet.
[10:34.93]Okay.
[10:35.69]That fucking stung.
[10:37.39]Stop.
[10:38.23]Stop hitting me.
[10:39.21]Stop slapping me.
[10:48.18]This is an original Pac-Man.
[10:56.91]Play Pac-Man in time two times.
[11:03.19]Try to do the original?
[11:05.35]Pac-land.
[11:08.62]What's Pac-land?
[11:14.16]How do you play Pac-land?
[11:26.53]Oh my god, it's this fucking game.
[11:36.66]To control Pac-Man, run in the direction of the arrow.
[11:39.97]How do you jump?
[12:00.27]I feel like I'm going max speed in Oregon Trail.
[12:04.41]Stop!
[12:06.51]I did it?
[12:07.53]Let's go!
[12:41.99]God, I'm gonna play that Bugs Bunny Smash Bros.
[12:43.88]game again.
[12:49.82]So, is that thing down there a timer?
[13:07.86]That's money.
[13:11.51]Oh, that's such bullshit when that happens.
[13:13.51]Absolute horseshit.
[13:15.41]Just total horseshit.
[13:19.72]Play multiverses again?
[13:20.80]I can't.
[13:21.32]They turned it off.
[13:22.99]The alpha's gone now.
[13:24.05]They closed it.
[13:40.97]When's it release?
[13:41.63]Uh, July, I think.
[13:43.33]July's the open beta.
[13:47.78]This game's awful.
[13:59.37]Alright, now what?
[14:07.09]Super Pac-Man?
[14:16.94]At least it shuts up the people.
[14:45.99]Okay, at least we can get away from that fucking song.
[15:20.85]Good.
[15:56.73]Here it comes.
[16:31.01]I fucked this whole thing up so bad.
[17:19.09]Let's go.
[17:48.16]I tried to press up, this game's fucking stupid.
[17:55.03]Wait, what?
[17:55.65]I didn't press it that many times!
[17:57.11]Did you guys know that Pac-Man was originally gonna be a pizza game?
[18:16.37]It was like, you put like sauce and cheese on the pizza and stuff and you put it in the oven.
[18:20.38]But the game director... The putting the sauce on the pizza sound sounded so funny to the director of the game.
[18:27.40]That... It's just like... Maybe we should change it to like an eating thing, where the pizza eats things.
[18:44.29]Fucking idiots.
[18:56.89]You- Lion comes so easily to you.
[19:17.61]I'm not a liar, I'm a performer.
[19:20.97]Shut up.
[19:25.20]It's a performance.
[19:26.48]Shut up.
[19:26.84]I'm a performer.
[19:41.06]This dude is wicked soy?
[19:42.24]I'm fine.
[19:45.10]That was fun.
[19:51.16]He was gonna be called Puckman.
[19:53.89]No, it's Pizza Man.
[20:03.06]Play Pac-Man two times.
[20:04.84]Okay, so I have to play this two times to unlock Super Pac-Man?
[20:07.71]Alright, I played it twice.
[20:09.79]Alright, come kill me.
[20:29.03]They found out in the U.S.
[20:30.19]kids would edit the P on the machine to an F. Remember, this sucks.
[20:42.55]Go back to Miku.
[20:48.54]I can't.
[20:48.86]I'm too burnt out to do Miku.
[20:51.36]I can't do Miku.
[20:52.16]I can't play Miku anymore.
[20:54.10]I'm burnt out from all the flashing colors.
[21:01.91]Miku or Riot.
[21:02.90]No, I can't right now.
[21:03.92]I'm just tired.
[21:04.40]Now... Look, I've got... I unlocked, um, Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man.
[21:06.30]There we go.
[21:07.04]Alright, what is Super Pac-Man?
[21:08.12]Have I ever played this?
[21:43.00]Is it the same one?
[21:46.32]This looks fucking weird.
[21:48.12]What the hell is this?
[21:53.49]I... This is interesting.
[22:00.17]Do I have to get all the keys?
[22:07.37]Pac-Man would never eat eggs, they're too healthy.
[22:10.55]Wait, he eats fruits.
[22:23.24]Please, my ears.
[22:24.06]It looks like it's turned on.
[22:36.28]What the fuck?
[22:36.84]I got all the fruits!
[22:42.52]It's all the keys?
[22:47.79]This is the kind of game that I would get for, like, my grandfather.
[22:53.73]on his first Steam account.
[22:58.93]And I would go to check a year from now to see what my grandfather had in his Steam library.
[23:05.28]And it would be this.
[23:09.50]And, I don't know, Dead Space 1 and 2, because it's on sale for $3 every year.
[23:17.69]It's the only games he would have.
[23:26.90]And all the free-to-play stuff and you'd go on it and see how much time that grandpa had playtime.
[23:31.36]He hadn't even opened them.
[23:34.04]500 hours on Path of Exile.
[24:03.59]They go too fast!
[24:04.57]I... I never was a fan of Pac-Man.
[24:09.27]I was... I was never a fan of Pac-Man.
[24:11.78]I was always... I was more of a fan of Pac-Man's character than I was his video games.
[24:26.58]Okay, there's Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Man Battle Royale, Pac-Land, Pac-Man Arrangement, and Pac-Pal?
[24:42.19]Okay, let me do Pac-Man Battle Royale.
[24:48.05]I love Pac-Man, he's the greatest video game character ever.
[24:51.28]But his, I don't know, his games were kind of...
[24:56.58]The original's great.
[24:58.91]Pac-Man's Great Adventure is great.
[25:00.79]The one where you have to, like, point him in directions and help him.
[25:04.15]Why is that not here?
[25:13.91]This one's good.
[25:14.47]Okay.
[25:20.77]Eat power pellets.
[25:29.79]He's a cannibal.
[25:37.12]How do you win?
[25:38.32]Wait, how do you hurt each other?
[25:44.36]I don't understand what's going on.
[25:47.38]Do I have to wait to eat each other?
[25:50.08]Ah, alright.
[25:50.38]That's alright.
[25:57.49]So I've won.
[25:58.37]Wait for next round!
[25:59.77]This is Zoomer Pac-Man?
[26:04.00]No it's not.
[26:10.62]Money in.
[26:17.78]I guess if you play with like four people it's fine.
[26:24.28]Does everyone have to have their own controller?
[26:26.90]At the arcade cabinet, that would be fun.
[26:28.51]Kiss the CPU.
[26:31.75]What?
[26:55.87]Lost to CPU.
[26:56.83]How come there's only one CPU?
[27:01.49]That's weird.
[27:01.97]Shouldn't there be way more?
[27:05.95]That's... how did I just lose that?
[27:07.13]Burger.
[27:07.41]You only have one CPU in your computer.
[27:28.62]You only have one CPU.
[27:30.14]Alright, this one sucks.
[27:34.73]This would be fun with like four actual friends sitting around.
[27:38.99]This is a scuffed version of Championship Edition.
[27:53.76]They have these at ta- they have these at- I think they have these as table machines in some arcades.
[27:58.78]That makes sense.
[27:59.54]I'm just fucking waltzing around.
[28:01.42]I'm not even paying attention.
[28:03.27]What just happened?
[28:03.93]Why is the sound getting faster?
[28:20.79]This is a Dave & Buster's game.
[28:24.63]It really is.
[28:30.45]This is a game at Dave & Buster's.
[28:33.77]That's so funny.
[28:37.41]Yeah, and it spits out, like, ten tickets.
[28:40.47]This shit, you're like, oh, great, cool, that was fun, I guess.
[28:46.49]I got, like, eight tickets.
[28:52.03]This literally is at Dave and Buster's.
[28:55.23]No, is it ac- no it's not?
[28:57.91]It actually is.
[28:58.77]Deal or No Deal is the best arcade game.
[29:19.92]Should I play Deal or No Deal on stream?
[29:21.75]I think that'd be fun.
[29:22.35]Alright, well that game is fun.
[29:28.21]It's fine.
[29:32.93]It's fine.
[29:35.50]Loud.
[29:35.70]My turn.
[29:48.39]Play Pac-Land two times.
[29:49.81]I want to know what Pac-Pal is, right?
[29:53.49]Pac-Mania and Pac-Land.
[29:55.38]Where's Pac-Land?
[29:56.04]Okay, so it's gonna open this and then close it.
[29:58.62]What is Pac-Pal?
[29:59.84]Oh, it knows.
[30:00.24]I have to actually get in and die.
[30:22.19]This one was actually the best one.
[30:26.08]There's more games in the big machine?
[30:35.66]What was the Pac-Man game you played, you made a video on like 10 years ago?
[30:39.63]That's Pac-Man 2.
[30:40.61]The Great Adventurer or something?
[30:44.41]It's not a Pac-Man game.
[30:45.91]It's a side-scrolling directions game.
[30:48.93]It's really weird.
[30:54.03]I wonder if there's a... they might be in it.
[31:06.23]This one has a final boss.
[31:07.29]It's not in this?
[31:07.99]Why would this not... is it a licensing problem?
[31:13.45]I thought that was gonna be on here.
[31:14.33]That's why I bought the game.
[31:16.67]I thought it was a Pac-Man Museum Plus.
[31:18.48]Okay, let's go.
[31:23.19]Pack and Time?
[31:25.63]That's one of them that I'm thinking of, right?
[31:28.93]Okay, well what's Pac-Man Arrangement?
[31:38.93]How did I not even know these games came out?
[31:40.21]Okay.
[31:50.12]Instructions.
[31:59.42]I've been playing video games for 30 years.
[32:02.38]I feel like these were all made up today.
[32:07.99]And I'm being gaslit into thinking these are real.
[32:11.64]I've never heard of these.
[32:38.48]why is there a bunny this one's actually fun I like this one this one's good dash whoa alright that's cool
[33:11.49]That was awesome It's just kind of fun to do that
[33:47.06]Pac-Man Arrangement?
[33:47.88]What a weird name.
[33:50.80]Is that why this game didn't do that well?
[33:52.08]Because it's called Pac-Man Arrangement?
[33:56.35]I thought I was going to be making flowers or something.
[34:00.43]Painting game.
[34:01.05]I didn't think it was going to be an actual Pac-Man game.
[34:21.82]Get them all!
[34:22.48]Good.
[34:37.85]Go!
[34:38.21]Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.
[34:42.97]Actually in trouble.
[34:44.01]Nope, I'm good.
[34:50.02]Why wouldn't it be a Pac-Man game?
[34:52.40]They've made some weird-ass Pac-Man games over the last 20 years.
[35:20.36]That's a big fuckin' deal.
[35:31.92]Missed one little pellet, really.
[35:56.24]They make a weird noise.
[35:57.72]Most of them go... They should have a Pac-Man themed wedding.
[36:16.51]I thought I... Wait, I thought that was it.
[36:17.59]I thought this was a bonus stage.
[36:20.50]What the fuck?
[36:45.66]Throwing for pack content.
[36:49.08]It is a bonus round.
[36:53.39]Okay, that was... I don't know why, I just got invincibility frames for a second.
[36:56.51]That was weird.
[37:15.48]Shit.
[37:16.00]Bad.
[37:19.47]What?
[37:19.85]I squirted this fucking goddamn controller.
[37:22.01]What the hell?
[37:46.50]oh no I'm pressing the buttons what the I'm pressing die it's just he hits a wall and freezes bro bro relax alright that was fun I I'm literally pressing the button it just hits the wall and move this is why pac-man only works
[38:12.60]When you have the stick that has only the four directions.
[38:17.50]Anything else is impossible.
[38:19.06]You cannot play Pac-Man with a regular fucking controller.
[38:21.45]You have to have four.
[38:23.87]One, two, three, four.
[38:25.37]That's it.
[38:34.51]Return to arcade.
[38:35.65]Yes, please.
[38:37.77]Use the D-pad.
[38:38.37]D-pad doesn't work either.
[38:40.32]Because sometimes you press up on a D-pad, it presses, like, left or right at the same time.
[38:45.46]I'm using an Xbox One controller.
[38:46.88]The D-pad's, like, all one gigantic button.
[38:53.41]You need a stick.
[38:54.43]Or arrow keys.
[38:55.17]Yeah, but I'm a fucking console gamer.
[38:57.49]Okay, now what is it for this?
[39:02.77]Play Pac-Land two times.
[39:04.53]Where's Pac-Land?
[39:11.58]Okay.
[39:12.24]How about not play- I already did play this once.
[39:17.90]Continue from pause date- Oh, I got sick of it and didn't want to play anymore.
[39:24.12]Play Deal or No Deal.
[39:25.22]We'll do that on, um, on Sunday.
[39:29.60]Here's your plan for Sunday.
[39:30.34]We're gonna play, we're gonna play, um, trivia and, and, um, game show games.
[39:35.94]How about Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
[39:37.82]Deal or No Deal.
[39:41.55]Maybe a couple others.
[39:43.03]We'll do that on Sunday.
[39:43.79]I'm just trying to die.
[39:51.45]Alright, now back out.
[39:57.83]Come back in.
[40:01.23]I want to at least see each game once.
[40:05.75]Play the awful full-priced millionaire game that came out like a year ago.
[40:08.65]Yeah, it's probably the one I'll play.
[40:21.72]Go buy more games.
[40:23.88]Let me unlock these ones first.
[40:35.27]What about the Oregon Trail?
[40:37.45]I don't... I think I have maybe once.
[40:39.71]Back during one of the DOS nights, maybe?
[40:41.07]I think so.
[40:54.98]Okay.
[40:58.36]Oh my fucking god, dude, really?
[41:03.78]I just played it again.
[41:04.66]Alright, let me be honest.
[41:09.72]I bought the fucking game.
[41:11.68]Do I have to really... Do you have to put all this shit under walls?
[41:15.10]Like, it's Pac-Man Museum.
[41:17.04]Do I really have to do all this to play the Pac-Man games I want to play?
[41:34.26]It's not a- it's a museum.
[41:35.42]It's- I don't- I don't have to go look at the Mona Lisa to unlock the other fucking paintings in the museum.
[41:42.68]If it's a museum, just put it in the museum!
[41:44.90]Just put it in the museum!
[41:47.72]Just put it- put it on display in the museum!
[41:56.77]Unlocking things is fun, you joyless Oscar human.
[42:11.69]Okay, can I please play the other game?
[42:13.19]I got it.
[42:24.19]Hackin' pal!
[42:34.72]Turn over the card and eat the flashing item.
[42:38.36]Give it back.
[42:39.10]I'm good.
[42:39.86]She's safe.
[42:40.34]Touch a ghost and you'll lose.
[42:43.30]Turn the tables with a special item.
[42:44.76]Press the button.
[42:45.44]That kind of hurts my head to look at.
[42:50.30]Eat the S.
[43:46.29]We did it.
[43:51.14]The one with the hat was better.
[43:52.46]I get the idea.
[44:06.26]The concept is interesting, right?
[44:07.92]But I... It's just modded Pac-Man.
[44:21.74]It's pretty awful.
[44:25.63]I'd say it's very awful.
[44:33.91]It's a less fun Pac-Man.
[44:36.39]Okay, so what are there any others I can do?
[44:39.21]This one played Pac-In-Time two times.
[44:41.75]Where's Pac-In-Time?
[44:42.57]Do I have to buy it?
[44:59.92]Where do I get it?
[45:00.82]How do I get, um, pack in time?
[45:02.68]It's the big one.
[45:03.91]What big one?
[45:04.69]I can't play it.
[45:05.71]Pause saving is not supported.
[45:07.77]Oh, what the fuck?
[45:34.83]Our hero Pac-Man is the cool video game dude we know and love.
[45:42.31]Okay.
[45:44.59]When the evil Ghost Witch and her ghost monsters invaded his world, Pac-Man was there to defend it.
[45:55.16]Since then, he's been living happily with his family in Pac-Land.
[46:04.74]But his fiendish archenemy, the Ghost Witch, has vowed to disrupt his tranquil life.
[46:09.38]Okay.
[46:14.47]Following the failure of her diabolical plan, she decided to eliminate Pac-Man once and for all.
[46:24.61]The Ghost Witch cast a forbidden spell on Pac-Man, ripping him from his family.
[46:30.60]Oh my god.
[46:34.25]and hurling him through time to his dangerous past.
[46:44.07]The journey back in time transformed Pac-Man into a young Pac-Boy.
[46:48.74]And the only change is he doesn't have a nose anymore.
[46:53.92]The Ghost Witch sent him to a world which has never heard of the hero Pac-Man.
[47:03.93]Look at how cute he is!
[47:04.49]I love this version of Pac-Man.
[47:06.73]He's so cute.
[47:07.18]Let's find out.
[47:34.90]Okay.
[47:39.30]Mountain.
[47:44.47]My eye.
[47:52.33]Um, huh?
[47:53.25]You have a... This is like Mega Man.
[48:07.73]Are they trying to make... Okay, the shoes, the fast running... They just tried to make a Sonic the Hedgehog version.
[48:16.97]What does that do?
[48:28.16]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[48:41.40]He's so stumpy.
[48:46.87]How do I open this?
[48:47.41]How do I open the chest?
[48:56.62]He looks like one of those custom South Park characters that everybody used to have.
[49:02.20]Do you remember that?
[49:15.91]Can I swim?
[49:16.37]I need a key.
[49:25.24]Ah.
[49:26.58]I can't swim.
[49:27.10]Rope.
[49:44.96]Every time I see somebody playing Mega Man that knows what they're doing and they're really good at the game... Some of the speedrunners, right?
[49:50.12]It's always like... They just like... When they jump, it's crazy.
[50:00.77]How do I get through here?
[50:01.45]Can I swim?
[50:06.35]I can't swim down.
[50:16.59]Use the item?
[50:18.37]What item?
[50:19.41]A?
[50:19.45]Oh, left bumper.
[50:51.82]Somebody just said, this sucks.
[51:03.08]How do I get down here?
[51:07.13]How do I break this?
[51:20.16]Can I drop down?
[51:20.78]I need a hammer.
[51:22.94]Press A. Is there another item?
[51:28.58]These controls are going to...
[51:49.64]Slow down, slow down.
[52:23.04]Get the water hammer?
[52:28.30]Where is it?
[52:34.70]This is worse than Glover.
[52:35.97]No, it's not.
[52:40.65]Where is this hammer?
[52:41.45]It's in the water of what?
[53:09.69]Get me out of here.
[53:11.67]How do I get in the fucking exit?
[53:29.75]I need all the rings?
[53:46.25]All the dots.
[53:49.67]I can't even get back up here, guys.
[53:50.97]I'm fucking screwed.
[53:56.05]I can't beat the level anymore.
[54:04.50]Where's the rope?
[54:08.68]Why did the rope get taken from me?
[54:14.81]Somebody said reviewer gameplay.
[54:17.45]Oh, please.
[54:18.13]You don't know how hard this is to control.
[54:23.62]It's so weird.
[54:38.52]Ow.
[54:41.30]Ouch.
[54:43.67]It's really weird.
[54:46.23]Okay, I think they're up here.
[54:53.89]He's so bouncy.
[54:54.83]It's strange.
[54:55.95]Trust me.
[55:04.75]I'm so impatient.
[55:05.45]I fucking can't do it.
[55:07.83]Got it.
[55:52.61]That's fine.
[55:53.41]I don't want to do that anymore.
[55:55.49]That was a really cute one, but I don't want to do that.
[56:02.53]Pack and Roll Remix.
[56:13.87]Okay.
[56:16.59]Is this a GameCube or something?
[57:24.71]Is he yelling?
[57:32.13]This is another Dave and Buster's game?
[57:33.59]I don't- I disagree.
[58:07.69]Check!
[58:09.78]Checkpoint.
[58:39.49]Get up there!
[58:42.85]Get up there!
[58:44.01]They're driving me fucking crazy.
[58:46.29]Get me the fuck out of here.
[59:06.60]It's just that you- BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!
[59:08.40]Like, you can't control it!
[59:09.94]It's bounce- It just- He's so bouncy!
[59:12.64]He's so bouncy in these games, it's ridiculous!
[59:15.76]But I have to play this again.
[59:16.73]He goes too fast, and he's too bouncy!
[59:30.49]I feel like my mouse sensitivity is too high.
[60:08.24]Games like these just drive me fucking crazy.
[60:10.00]I remember when I was a little kid, snake rattle and roll.
[60:14.08]I tried to break the Nintendo controller in half.
[60:18.18]Like, bending it this way, because I hated it so much.
[60:26.23]And all it did was just made really loud crackling sounds.
[60:30.55]Like, I was not strong enough to break it, obviously, so it was just like...
[60:35.67]All you heard was just crunching sounds.
[60:44.52]Not strong enough to break it, but strong enough to, like, kind of fuck it up.
[60:50.97]Just get me out of here.
[60:51.63]I don't want to play this.
[61:02.10]Snake, rattle and roll is good, you're just bad.
[61:04.22]No, I- I didn't say that.
[61:05.76]Pac-Man 256.
[61:06.30]What is this?
[61:07.01]What the fuck?
[61:08.75]Is this a mobile game?
[61:30.76]Thank you.
[62:42.37]I just kept hearing a guy laughing.
[62:47.38]I just hear... I want it again.
[63:11.22]What is this bucking horse shit, and why are you so fast?
[63:13.80]That's pretty cool.
[63:45.96]What the fuck?
[63:49.19]Alright, one more.
[63:52.55]One more and that's it.
[63:53.33]This is the best one so far.
[64:06.77]I need to get a thousand.
[64:07.75]I want to get over a thousand again.
[64:51.83]Move!
[65:20.68]2,000.
[65:20.70]2,500.
[65:20.88]2,500 and I'm done.
[65:21.32]Uh-oh.
[65:21.44]5,000 and I'm out of here.
[65:54.39]Oh, shit!
[66:32.74]Alright, that was bullshit.
[66:44.83]More tuber reactions?
[66:45.89]Yeah.
[66:46.29]Alright, 5k and that's it.
[66:48.89]I promise, that's it.
[66:50.23]5k and I'm out.
[66:53.82]That one.
[67:07.27]Is it on iPad?
[67:11.17]Can I get this on iPad?
[67:38.24]Nice five!
[67:38.66]How do you get the multiplier higher?
[67:41.49]Fucking, what are you doing?
[67:42.19]Do something!
[67:42.53]What the fuck?!
[67:42.97]What the hell was that?
[68:16.09]You gotta get the fruits, alright.
[68:17.35]Let me see if I can get 10k.
[68:20.15]Alright, times two.
[68:26.17]The coins don't matter that much.
[68:33.14]I gotta get fruits.
[68:41.18]Cherry!
[68:44.03]Times four, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[68:49.19]Times six.
[68:49.49]This is gonna be 6k.
[69:24.77]GO!
[70:01.39]Oh, oh, oh.
[70:31.00]Oh no!
[70:31.92]5,000 points!
[70:51.72]Please!
[70:54.88]Do I get anything for doing it?
[70:58.78]Do I- I don't get anything to- Oh my god.
[71:06.79]Fuck.
[71:11.51]Oh, I'm addicted to this stupid game.
[71:35.83]Get out of the fucking way.
[71:39.06]Oh my god.
[72:11.24]What does that stuff do?
[72:12.96]I don't think- I've never touched it.
[72:14.22]Oh no.
[72:14.34]Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.
[72:45.25]Shhh!
[73:25.20]Which way was he going?!
[73:26.64]Oh my god, fucking damn it!
[73:28.56]I... Your mic is fucked up.
[73:32.49]I'm gonna fucking break it.
[73:35.25]Oh, come on!
[73:46.20]I have to get 5k or I refuse to turn the stream off.
[73:49.38]I am not turning the stream off till I get 5,000 points in Pac-Man 200.
[73:54.55]That's a fact.
[74:05.91]Why did that blow up?
[74:36.77]Don't even.
[74:37.35]Don't even.
[74:37.89]Don't even.
[74:45.60]What are you doing?
[74:46.50]Oh my fucking god.
[74:50.68]Jeremy.
[74:52.06]You had so many options.
[74:53.24]Quiet.
[75:45.41]You're moving too slow.
[75:56.56]Find me a path I can go.
[75:58.00]Find me one path.
[76:00.04]Every path is blocked.
[76:01.66]Find me a single path I could go down.
[76:05.16]Which path?
[76:06.80]Blocked.
[76:07.30]Blocked.
[76:07.80]Blocked.
[76:08.38]Blocked.
[76:09.14]Blocked.
[76:09.52]Blocked.
[76:26.84]I DIDN'T GET THAT FUCKING THING!
[77:33.71]I have to stop doing that.
[77:48.80]I need to build up a multiplier.
[77:50.01]No, no, no, no, no!
[78:01.63]Use the shop.
[78:16.02]Power-ups.
[78:17.30]Collect coins to upgrade your power- Oh, I can upgrade?
[78:20.61]Add it to your loadout?
[78:27.11]Upgrade to level 1.
[78:27.85]We're gonna be here all night.
[78:31.15]Okay.
[78:41.72]I don't like the freeze.
[78:48.21]That's kind of annoying.
[78:54.03]Okay.
[78:57.65]Let's go.
[79:01.19]How do I activate one of them?
[79:02.51]Can I actually just use one?
[79:04.51]How do I use that?
[79:08.79]Oh, that's just what appears.
[79:09.86]I get it.
[79:10.20]Okay.
[79:38.30]That got way too gritty.
[79:50.52]Unequip the freeze?
[79:51.58]Yeah, it kinda sucks, doesn't it?
[79:56.31]How do I take it off?
[79:59.45]Oh, okay.
[80:01.91]That's much better.
[80:03.19]Let's go.
[80:28.72]Yeah, right.
[80:33.74]Yeah, right.
[80:35.91]You stink.
[80:38.61]It's fine.
[80:39.07]I just need 5k.
[80:40.49]I need 5k.
[80:58.60]Big points coming up here.
[80:59.72]Tornado!
[81:00.02]No, no, no!
[81:00.20]That... Why was he chasing me over here?
[81:01.30]I know what...
[81:30.18]I fucking hate this.
[81:34.14]I love this game, but I hate it at the same time.
[81:36.09]I just want 5k and I'm done.
[81:37.31]You just fucked with me.
[81:46.93]Why is there so many ghosts in the early game here?
[81:52.17]Get out of here.
[82:00.40]Okay.
[82:29.61]I didn't trust it.
[82:47.03]You motherfucker!
[83:50.67]Come on, run into me!
[83:51.39]Please, please run into me!
[83:57.81]I've gotta get you!
[84:25.73]Got it.
[85:03.25]I picked up the fucking thing!
[85:04.67]I went over one of the pellets, why did they not... I don't understand.
[85:09.37]I picked up a pellet.
[85:12.89]I'm done.
[85:13.19]That was fun.
[85:18.99]That was the best one so far.
[85:31.12]That's actually the best one so far.
[85:35.17]Orange always goes down?
[85:37.04]Really?
[85:37.30]I feel like I should have gotten some points for that.
[85:48.05]Pack and time two times.
[85:51.05]Pac-Man arrangement?
[85:54.31]I'll do this one and then I'm done.
[85:57.63]I'll play this once and then the stream's over.
[86:05.43]This one is actually really fun, isn't it?
[86:19.38]Yeah, this is just the other one but better.
[86:39.53]The last two have been way more fun.
[86:40.99]Yikes.
[87:23.07]Didn't want to pick that up.
[87:34.42]Wow!
[87:42.17]Dude, the fucking analog stick just...
[87:54.67]Fucking goddamn controller.
[87:56.46]Give me the arrow keys instead.
[88:25.22]That was very greedy!
[88:26.40]Ooh!
[89:59.34]My fucking fingers!
[90:00.64]I need a stick!
[90:08.08]I need a stick so bad.
[90:55.43]I need stick! 116,000.
[91:31.30]200,000 points.
[91:34.43]I think I could go for it.
[91:35.15]Alright.
[91:35.51]One more go.
[91:36.01]One more go.
[91:36.43]Last one.
[91:37.37]Five minutes.
[91:37.73]Let's go.
[91:38.03]Arrow keys.
[91:38.87]I'm going for it.
[91:39.41]I'm going for 200,000.
[92:51.73]Risky!
[93:15.97]What?
[93:16.29]Who are you?
[93:17.17]What the fuck was that?
[93:21.52]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[93:23.43]Fuck that.
[93:25.68]Unlucky.
[93:51.80]Oh!
[94:24.24]Press the wrong fucking button.
[95:15.62]I couldn't touch it!
[95:16.62]I'm seriously so pissed.
[95:18.85]I need a fucking stick.
[95:19.75]It's impossible without a stick.
[96:18.50]200... 120.
[96:18.54]Whatever.
[96:48.80]That's so fucking fun.
[96:52.23]Ugh, what a fun game.
[96:56.01]I can't do it.
[97:02.27]That's so good.
[97:04.17]Ugh, that was fun.
[97:05.89]Alright.
[97:07.23]I think that's it.
[97:10.23]I'll see you guys... I've been speech jamming myself the whole time.
[97:15.50]I'll see you guys on Sunday, that's gonna be it.
[97:18.90]We're gonna do some, who wants to be a millionaire, we'll do, what's wrong with my voice?
[97:25.10]Who wants to be a million... I just can't listen to it.
[97:29.63]It just, it'd make it, it'd make me talk weird.
[97:32.61]Okay.
[97:33.49]Who wants to be a millionaire?
[97:34.59]Deal or no deal?
[97:38.13]Maybe some Wheel of Fortune or something?
[97:39.95]I'll get a bunch.
[97:40.39]So, I'll see you guys Sunday, Sunday at...
[97:49.03]I'll try to be here at 3 again.
[97:50.59]3 Pacific.
[97:52.65]Let's see if I can pull it back to 3.
[97:53.45]That was a lot of fun.
[97:57.27]MultiVersus, I actually cannot wait to play more of that when it comes out in July.
[98:00.57]I want to keep practicing with bugs.
[98:05.75]You can just let me play the practice mode.
[98:10.90]This is kind of loud.
[98:13.60]Thanks for joining me, though.
[98:14.38]I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[98:18.58]Goodbye.
[98:21.27]We see you again, we see you again.
[98:28.27]Those last two Pac-Man games, man, I wish I played those first.
[98:41.47]The seamless co-op mod for Elden Ring just came out today.
[98:44.94]I'll have to look into that.
[98:46.14]I'm very curious about it.
[98:55.51]You should play more Miku.
[99:02.75]I've had a good time.
[99:05.65]Multiversus was really fun.
[99:06.91]Miku was really fun.
[99:08.65]These last few Pac-Man games have been really fun.
[99:10.51]I'm going to be so... I really want to play that Multiversus right now.
[99:19.68]Just off stream.
[99:21.92]Damn.
[99:22.36]Okay.
[99:22.46]Okay.
[99:23.94]I'll see you guys Sunday.
[99:24.56]Take care of yourselves.
[99:25.78]Call your mother.
[99:31.64]You should do Miku Mondays.
[99:36.93]Nah.
[99:41.13]I promise the next time you hear me scream, it will not be distorted.
[99:46.27]I'm gonna get that audio fixed by Sunday.
[99:48.49]I promise.
[99:50.68]I will get it sorted.
[100:02.19]He's not going to fix it.
[100:02.91]He always lies to us.
[100:10.43]What's his new face?
[100:25.70]It's a stupid.
[100:27.80]Alright.
[100:28.02]Good night, guys.
[100:28.44]I'll see you later.
[100:36.72]you
[101:11.58]you
[101:46.47]you
