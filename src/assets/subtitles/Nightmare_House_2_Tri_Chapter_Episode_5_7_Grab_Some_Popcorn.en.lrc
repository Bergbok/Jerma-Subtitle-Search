[02:34.85]Where's my guns?
[02:37.99]Did I lose my guns?
[02:39.13]Did they get taken from me?
[02:42.23]That's a lot of BS.
[02:45.75]Oh, now the flare is gone.
[02:47.65]Oh, great.
[02:48.62]And a room that's totally dark.

[02:59.22]Stay down!
[03:01.89]Ah, it's like strobe light effect.
[03:03.35]I can't even see where I'm going.
[03:06.23]Oh my god, there's another guy behind me!

[03:19.54]Okay.
[03:21.40]So far... Finally, my... Good god, what is that?
[03:26.60]Oh, it's the entrance to the green room I was just in.
[03:30.52]No flashlight, though.
[03:32.42]That's awesome.
[03:35.36]Forklift.
[03:37.58]Anything else over here?
[03:38.50]No, I'm gonna have to drop down.
[03:42.80]Oh, I'm gonna throw up, man.
[03:45.34]Oh my god, this is like, yeah.
[03:47.12]I don't even know where he is.
[03:50.39]What the hell?
[03:50.81]Where is he?
[03:51.29]What's going on?
[03:51.79]Oh my god, he's like right in front of me.
[03:55.53]Oh my god.
[03:57.07]Oh my god.
[04:00.35]I don't even know where he was.
[04:03.42]Please, please, just... Just get unloaded on.
[04:09.00]You creep.
[04:09.62]There's gonna be another one.
[04:16.81]Man, I can't see anything.
[04:18.19]This is so horrible.
[04:20.59]Get away.
[04:21.13]Where is he?
[04:21.67]Where is he?
[04:25.43]God.
[04:28.68]Gotta break this.
[04:31.99]Oh, get me out of this room before I lose my lunch.
[04:36.25]Caution, this equipment starts and stops automatically.
[04:39.97]Okay.
[04:41.67]So that means, like, a saw's gonna come down and hit me in the face.
[04:44.68]Oh, you know what?
[04:45.72]Great.
[04:46.80]Great.
[04:47.28]Hey, look at this!
[04:49.28]Closing me in the room.
[04:53.82]Hello?
[04:55.70]Hello?
[04:59.90]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you think?
[05:02.12]There's nothing I can do.
[05:06.08]What am I gonna, like, launch?
[05:08.84]What am I in, like, a spaceship?
[05:10.70]Nice.
[05:11.02]Nice.
[05:11.24]That lady is a troll, if I've ever seen one.
[05:13.36]Nothing I can do over here, except go in another vent.
[05:30.21]These things give me the most amount of trouble, guys.
[05:32.23]Like, I really get so... God.
[05:36.35]Get out of here.
[05:40.20]You go first, Flare.
[05:41.16]I don't want to go.
[05:44.12]There is nothing up there.
[05:48.46]Pyrotechnics.
[05:51.04]I thought that thing was just leaking gasoline for a second.
[05:55.53]We need all kinds of light.
[05:56.51]I'm lighting up the entire place.
[06:00.13]Get out of the way.
[06:04.34]Thank you very much.
[06:06.22]Thank you very much.
[06:07.62]That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
[06:10.98]Another flare.
[06:15.40]Thank you very much.
[06:17.25]Thank you very much.
[06:18.95]What the hell?
[06:20.91]Oh.
[06:23.33]Hello.
[06:23.59]Yeah.
[06:24.83]Yeah.
[06:29.40]How did I... Oh, I must have fell through.
[06:30.64]Okay.
[06:32.34]At least I got my flashlight back.
[06:33.70]Oh, is this... This... Asshole.
[06:37.40]Oh, yeah.
[06:37.64]Yeah, I already saw those guys.
[06:39.80]They left me for dead.
[06:41.24]Yeah, don't worry.
[06:41.80]My entire squad died.
[06:42.98]No thanks to you.
[07:05.74]Shut off the equipment.
[07:08.13]Oh, he swore.
[07:10.15]I heard what he said.
[07:14.81]Coffee?
[07:15.39]I'll take a coffee.
[07:16.59]And break it.
[07:17.67]Let's go.
[07:18.89]Charge that light.
[07:21.11]I don't want to use that yet.
[07:22.72]So, get through the door, man.
[07:24.10]What are you doing?
[07:26.96]Hey!
[07:27.24]Hey!
[07:29.32]At least, what are these, like, crash test dummies?
[07:33.26]Which way am I going?
[07:34.40]Oh, we got the crash test dummies.
[07:37.68]Stop.
[07:39.88]Wait, what?
[07:42.10]Wasn't this thing just standing right here?
[07:45.75]Okay.
[07:50.17]Let's go.
[07:50.69]What the hell?
[07:54.79]What?
[07:54.93]What?
[07:58.19]What, are these things like alive?
[08:01.59]Why can I not, can I go through them?
[08:04.79]What the hell is going on?
[08:09.79]These things are gonna follow me, aren't they?
[08:12.84]Yeah, get through that.
[08:14.20]Door closed.
[08:16.10]Oh my god.
[08:17.08]I feel like... If you guys have ever seen... Billy Madison.
[08:24.60]The part in Billy Madison when the principal...
[08:28.17]comes out of the house and they're trying- the kids are trying to tell the principal, open the door, you- Oh my god, this is the freakiest- Oh my god!
[08:39.36]But when the principal comes outside, and there's a bunch of kids out there, and he's like, oh, hello kids, uh, hi, and then he, like, takes two steps, and there's more kids, he's like, oh, jeez, and then there's more kids.
[08:52.39]That's what's happening right now.
[08:55.17]These things just follow you around.
[08:57.62]Oh, hey.
[08:59.74]Oh, look, it's Jerry.
[09:02.38]Open up, Jerry.
[09:06.14]Yeah, let me in.
[09:08.95]Oh, let me in the door.
[09:11.07]Hey, open the door, you dip, you idiot.
[09:15.13]Oh.
[09:16.69]What is this guy doing?
[09:19.04]What, you want me to go around?
[09:20.28]You can't, like, open the door for me?
[09:21.70]Thanks a lot.
[09:24.12]You dumbass.
[09:27.37]Yeah.
[09:28.97]No, what are you doing?
[09:31.83]Are you... Can I get in here now?
[09:33.79]Hey, thanks.
[09:34.48]What's up, Jerry?
[09:39.14]You troll.
[09:41.32]You're not Jerry!
[09:43.44]You're Jerry!
[09:49.43]So apparently these mannequins, or these dummies, whatever they are, they eat people too, apparently.
[09:55.33]Because that was Jerry.
[09:56.21]Where's Dugan?
[09:57.86]What have you done with Dugan?
[10:00.75]What have you done with... I don't want to get close to this lady.
[10:10.91]Wow, that's one of my other guys.
[10:14.40]Computer!
[10:15.52]Wait, there's probably bullets or something over here.
[10:17.12]I don't want to miss something that I... I need to potentially get some bullets or something.
[10:24.67]No, there's nothing.
[10:26.25]Isn't that just fantastic?
[10:29.29]Let's go.
[10:32.88]This thing's gonna move.
[10:33.62]Watch.
[10:34.64]Nope.
[10:35.64]Yeah, that one is.
[10:37.28]Don't wanna waste these.
[10:39.56]I gotta shoot these guys.
[10:41.05]Gotta make these count, though.
[10:44.35]Don't just shoot for no reason.
[10:49.80]Flare, bullets.
[10:51.08]Good, good, good.
[10:52.90]I'll take that flare.
[10:54.14]Where am I going to bring it, though?
[10:55.04]That's the real question.
[10:56.88]Cold drinks!
[11:01.15]Uh-oh.
[11:02.09]Sure it is.
[11:02.93]Get out of here.
[11:04.13]Get out of my face!
[11:05.21]My God, this guy is relentless!
[11:19.89]Oh my... Get out of here!
[11:22.97]There's another one.
[11:25.07]You know what?
[11:25.65]Get headshot!
[11:27.29]Alright, I don't want to waste that on you.
[11:33.45]I'll just crouch down and hit you in the face.
[11:35.31]Play ball!
[11:36.91]Yeah, get out of here.
[11:38.65]You limey bastard.

[12:25.76]No, I cannot.
[12:27.86]But I will take this flare.
[12:29.57]For sure.
[12:32.37]Anybody in here?
[12:33.15]Nope!
[12:36.57]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[12:39.17]No, you can't go in that door.
[12:41.83]So you might as well climb up all the steps.
[12:45.34]Hee-ha, hee-ha, hoo.
[12:46.94]Give me the flare.
[12:48.76]Dude.
[12:50.94]Alright, nothing, nothing, nothing.

[12:58.50]Now I can call my grandmother!
[13:02.26]Get away.
[13:02.98]Close this door, too.
[13:05.36]Incoming transmission?
[13:06.85]From Dr. Butthead?
[13:09.81]Paging, Dr. Butthead.
[13:13.33]Incoming outgoing.
[13:14.21]A lot of incoming stuff going on here.
[13:18.67]Okay.
[13:19.77]I've really had to unscrew the top.
[13:22.15]That's pretty ridiculous.
[13:25.23]Make sure you unscrew the top of the gas can.
[13:27.33]Alright, let's get it.
[13:33.88]Yeah, you're probably right.
[13:35.76]Actually, can I go in this door?
[13:37.62]I can.
[13:38.18]Let's go!
[13:39.10]Oh, dear goodness!
[13:41.92]Hey!
[13:43.08]Everything's blowing up.
[13:44.88]That's probably not the way I should have- Whoa!
[13:46.93]Hello, see you later.
[13:49.27]That's not the way I want to go.
[13:50.27]Yes, it is.
[13:51.31]Sidestep.
[13:52.01]Sidestep.
[13:52.83]Get away from me.
[13:54.49]Get away from me.
[13:55.38]See you later.
[13:57.44]How's your Christmas?
[13:59.34]Have fun.
[14:00.34]Happy Thanksgiving.
[14:02.96]Oh!
[14:03.24]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[14:03.96]Cannot go that way.
[14:04.56]Give me that health.
[14:08.14]Oh, I can't.
[14:08.54]I have to go that way.
[14:12.12]No, I can't.
[14:13.76]Back this way, then.
[14:18.43]No.
[14:20.60]Where am I going?
[14:21.66]What, am I locked in here with the flames?
[14:28.64]Let's go back this way.
[14:30.77]Probably missing something, but it's like the water.
[14:33.83]Bullets, thank God.
[14:35.41]Oh, here we go, okay.
[14:42.91]Um, maybe I could make the jump.
[14:44.15]Oh, okay, I gotta make the jump.
[14:47.66]I'm stuck!
[14:48.44]I'm stuck!
[14:49.79]I am legit stuck.
[14:50.49]Not anymore.
[14:53.11]Fire, fire.
[14:54.37]Put out the fire.
[14:57.18]Hey, I wonder if there's going to be something behind me.
[15:00.46]Yeah, fire.
[15:02.00]Yeah, it'd be nice to open the door right now.
[15:11.27]Okay.
[15:12.13]Thanks, lady.
[15:12.73]Appreciate it.
[15:19.53]I'm assuming I gotta follow her.
[15:20.88]Whew.
[15:25.24]Into the morgue.
[15:26.24]But I wanna go in here first.
[15:28.28]Is there anything in there?
[15:30.34]There is.
[15:30.62]Oh, that was the door I could've gone in anyways.
[15:35.46]And all kinds of stuff is flying all over the place.
[15:38.24]Dead bodies.
[15:39.94]How sufficient.
[15:41.14]And that's... Okay.
[15:50.32]Whoa.
[15:51.12]Whoa.
[15:51.80]Whoa.
[15:56.84]I'm being, like, worked on right now.
[16:01.18]What?
[16:03.81]I'm, like, Skeletor now?
[16:05.13]I turn into, like, a supervillain?
[16:08.57]That was interesting.
[16:10.07]To say the least.
[16:14.83]Hey!
[16:15.29]Oh, here's my crew.
[16:22.39]Yeah.
[16:27.97]Can you give me one of your guns?
[16:31.67]Do you copy?
[16:33.86]Oh my god, yeah!
[16:36.66]Give me health, guns, ammo, and weapons.
[16:39.40]Heck yes!
[16:43.40]One civilian killed in action.
[16:47.96]Alright, let's go, you leaner.
[16:49.32]Look at this guy just nonchalantly.
[16:50.72]Dude, there's a zombie apocalypse going on right now.
[16:53.32]And you're just leaning.
[16:54.38]You gotta be ready.
[16:56.64]You gotta be ready to rock and roll, man.
[16:58.20]Get out of my face.
[17:02.23]Chapter 6, Evac.
[17:10.13]Looks like we got some stuff.
[17:11.55]Hey, how are y'all?
[17:15.76]Keep moving.
[17:16.32]Charge the light.
[17:21.78]Yeah, I know, I know, I'm coming for you.
[17:25.72]This guy had a bad day.
[17:29.44]See, that really stinks.
[17:30.54]When you get a garage door closed on you, you know something's wrong.
[17:41.15]This way.
[17:41.69]Oh, I see a vent!
[17:45.89]Can't wait.
[17:46.51]Another locked door, great.
[17:57.04]Hey, you want me to get into this vent?
[18:01.26]Easier said than done, dude.
[18:02.62]What do you think I am, Michael Jordan?
[18:04.84]I can't, like, jump that high.
[18:06.46]I can't, like, slam dunk into there.
[18:11.97]I gotta get... Yeah, I gotta get in there.
[18:16.99]Head up, head up.
[18:19.09]I'm stuck down here.
[18:22.67]So, oh, you can lift the forklift.
[18:26.57]Interesting, interesting.
[18:28.47]Let's do it again.
[18:31.87]Charge the light for a second.
[18:34.77]Lift me up!
[18:37.67]Woohoo!
[18:39.53]I'm at Disneyland.
[18:40.65]I love the rides.
[18:45.24]There we go.
[18:46.68]Oh, my goodness gracious, pull out the gun.
[19:00.48]Hi guys.
[19:01.78]What?
[19:02.42]What?
[19:03.93]What?
[19:06.39]So they're just corpses now down there.
[19:10.35]Oh, that's just fantastic.
[19:12.73]That is amazing.
[19:13.94]I'm so glad that this is happening right now.
[19:19.69]Get out of here.
[19:20.43]So I lost all my guys.
[19:21.57]They all just like disintegrated into bones.
[19:25.87]God.
[19:29.18]Storage or that way?
[19:30.44]Storage.
[19:31.50]No storage.
[19:32.28]Okay.
[19:33.84]Be that way then.
[19:34.92]Be that way.
[19:41.40]What?
[19:44.26]What?
[19:44.52]You guys was just dead.
[19:46.42]Especially you, Dugan.
[19:49.23]Let's go.
[19:53.52]Yeah, blow it.
[19:54.06]Can you blow that up?
[19:55.80]Please tell me that you can do that.
[19:57.20]By the way, how come this guy didn't tell me he could do this before?
[20:00.86]Yeah, you could open every door like that.
[20:02.42]Give me your shotgun.
[20:03.20]I'll take it from you.
[20:06.05]You're not really putting it to that much use anyways.
[20:07.99]Flare.
[20:12.77]Nobody can see.
[20:13.69]Flare.
[20:17.25]A bunch of boxes.
[20:19.37]Yeah, a bunch of boxes.
[20:20.85]Hey, yo, hey, how are you?
[20:23.03]What, what, what, what, what, what is going on behind us?
[20:25.49]Oh my god!
[20:31.16]I'm wedged in by the moron behind me!
[20:34.20]Hey, quit wedging me in, dude!
[20:39.28]Oh, they never stop coming!
[20:45.57]Another flare, pick it up.
[20:48.48]Well, let's... Making sure I'm not missing anything, let's go!
[20:52.92]Hey, get your magic shotgun over here and open this door!
[21:01.39]Oh, he did.
[21:03.57]Haha, nevermind.
[21:05.17]You're not needed.
[21:05.79]Well, let's... Have a flare, let's go.
[21:13.26]Get me out of this maze of boxes.
[21:18.26]More bullets.
[21:19.08]They're preparing me for something, guys.
[21:23.32]Yeah, you guys can handle that.
[21:24.38]I'm running ahead.
[21:28.84]Yeah, go ahead.
[21:29.44]Follow him.
[21:30.06]Follow them.
[21:32.50]Leave me be.
[21:36.88]Keep going.
[21:37.44]Keep moving.
[21:40.30]See you guys.
[21:41.85]Thanks for the distraction.
[21:47.11]Oh wait, are they still alive?
[21:49.23]Hey, you made it!
[21:51.15]I'm so happy for you guys.
[21:54.19]Are all three of you here?
[21:55.07]You are.
[21:57.03]Very good.
[21:58.51]And I got plenty of bullets.
[22:03.65]Hey, shaky screen.
[22:07.37]Shoot it.
[22:09.53]Shoot it.
[22:09.83]Will you just use the magic shotgun?
[22:16.55]This guy's gonna blow up and, like, turn into a zombie right now.
[22:18.65]Oh my god.
[22:20.97]I'm, like, hiding behind this thing.
[22:24.62]Oh, it's not gonna happen.
[22:25.44]Okay.
[22:26.98]Get out of the way.
[22:31.38]Yeah, do it.
[22:35.45]Magic shotgun!
[22:36.43]Woohoo!
[22:37.09]Shoot the door and it opens magically.
[22:41.57]I like your style, man.
[22:46.05]Hmm.
[22:48.57]We need to get that gate open.
[22:49.47]You two go see if you can find the controls.
[22:51.17]I'll stay here with him until he gets better.
[22:52.99]Yeah, that's a great idea.
[22:56.43]He's gonna blow up, and you're gonna turn into a zombie too.
[22:59.37]Go ahead.
[23:08.22]Are you kidding me?
[23:11.14]That guy just showed me up so bad in front of the guys, man.
[23:14.04]You're gonna do that to me in front of the boys?
[23:16.86]Hey, get up here.
[23:17.92]I want to talk to you for a second.
[23:19.52]Hey, hey, do me a favor.
[23:21.46]Never embarrass me like that again in front of the guy.
[23:23.65]So, you know what?
[23:24.15]I'm going to punch you in the face.
[23:25.83]You got that?
[23:26.79]Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
[23:27.53]Yeah, you better say sorry.
[23:29.21]Now follow me.
[23:34.18]Bullets.
[23:37.58]What switch?
[23:38.62]Oh, this one.
[23:39.52]The big one.
[23:43.80]So that means it's open.
[23:45.96]Get out of the way.
[23:46.66]Hey, look at the lower right.
[23:51.83]There's two dead.
[23:55.41]Guarantee there's gonna be a giant monster out here.
[23:59.02]Should I shoot him in the head?
[24:17.72]I just... I don't know which one I was... Oh my god.
[24:35.26]Wow.
[24:35.92]The game just got... I can't believe that just happened.
[24:39.83]Wow.
[24:49.88]I just did that!
[24:50.80]I put an end to this!
[24:58.14]Who should- what's- Just drop the gun, man.
[25:01.12]Come on.
[25:04.02]I already- I j- I just did- So I already did that.
[25:21.71]Well, alright.
[25:22.51]So I was supposed to do that to begin with.
[25:30.41]I just, like, jumped the gun.
[25:31.43]Oh my god, these guys are sooooo... You like that?
[25:45.94]Alright, now can you open the door?
[25:48.38]Yes, you can.
[25:51.83]You are getting too old.
[25:52.73]You can't hang anymore, Jerry.
[25:58.97]More ammunition.
[26:04.21]Yeah, hurry up.
[26:06.91]Oh, my God!
[26:11.48]Oh, man!
[26:12.72]Oh, man, oh, man.
[26:17.08]That was bad.
[26:21.18]Oh!
[26:21.72]Are we getting chased?
[26:22.60]Hopefully not.
[26:24.84]Where'd he go?
[26:26.04]Thought I was alone here for a second.
[26:27.42]That scared me.
[26:31.22]Too many of them!
[26:32.04]There's too many of them!
[26:34.98]No, I don't want to use that.
[26:36.10]I'm gonna use this first.
[26:40.87]Go through the weak gun first.
[26:42.33]Well, actually, this isn't really that weak, but... It's not as powerful as the SMG by any means.
[26:52.29]You good?
[26:54.45]Yeah, well, you're supposed to be... Yeah, breach it!
[27:01.72]Breach it, man!
[27:02.44]Hit it!
[27:05.38]Oh, he's already dead.
[27:06.28]I'm, like, unloading on a useless corpse.
[27:13.24]Stop!
[27:13.78]I can't see anything!
[27:21.39]Gonna have to switch to the axe, because I know I'm gonna need that crap later.
[27:26.58]Go, go, go, go, go!
[27:30.30]Breach it!
[27:31.00]Breach it!
[27:31.46]Come on!
[27:32.88]Our covers!
[27:35.46]I'll pull the covers over our head.
[27:37.66]To save ourselves from monsters.
[27:42.79]Secure the what?
[27:44.79]What am I securing?
[27:49.65]Oh man, come on!
[27:53.82]Get this.
[27:56.18]Stop wall blocking me, dude.
[27:58.10]You're going to get me killed.
[27:59.34]Yeah.
[28:06.67]Eat lead.
[28:10.09]Health.
[28:10.77]Ammo 2.
[28:11.51]Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.
[28:15.79]Alright, we made it.
[28:17.34]Oh, yeah.
[28:19.20]We did it.
[28:20.24]We did it.
[28:23.34]That's a huge moon.
[28:25.18]That moon is abnormally large.
[28:29.22]Oh, we made it.
[28:32.58]We're gonna get out.
[28:33.52]We're gon- I beat the game.
[28:35.20]I beat the game.
[28:37.30]I beat the game.
[28:39.08]That's right, I beat the game.
[28:40.48]You cannot beat the game with you.
[28:44.82]Oh, this guy's gonna- Oh god!
[28:48.49]What?
[28:48.93]What no- What the- Oh my god, it's coming right for us!
[28:52.21]Oh my god!
[28:57.44]Did I die?
[28:59.46]Let's watch this guy not make it.
[29:01.78]Noooo!
[29:04.52]Ohohoho!
[29:06.97]That guy went flying!
[29:08.57]Where's my coffee?
[29:14.01]Did I beat the game?
[29:16.47]Did I do it?
[29:22.82]Loading.
[29:24.48]Loading!
[29:28.31]Flashlight?
[29:30.13]Flashlight doesn't work.
[29:34.31]Currently on fire.
[29:35.33]And I got all my stuff back.
[29:41.72]Chapter 7, Requiem.
[29:43.14]You know what?
[29:44.04]Let's just blow right through this.
[29:45.34]Chapter 7, let's go.
[29:46.62]Let's do it, baby.
[29:52.51]Oh, no.
[29:53.05]Jeffrey!
[29:54.59]Jeffrey!
[29:59.26]Who is responsible for this?
[30:00.73]Is it the doctor?
[30:02.29]It's definitely the doctor.
[30:04.25]Yeah, Doctor Dickhead.
[30:05.09]So the doctor was behind it all, huh?
[30:29.15]You know what, man?
[30:30.55]Okay, well, now you're dead.
[30:33.77]Thanks for the info, dude.
[30:35.85]Let's go kill this doctor.
[30:40.00]He's been playing me as a fool the whole time, guys.
[30:42.32]Oh, yeah?
[30:43.42]Sure.
[30:43.58]Okay.
[31:01.27]Alright.
[31:01.49]Yeah.
[31:01.63]So there's two options.
[31:02.17]Run away, or fight the doctor.
[31:02.91]I think we're gonna go fight the doctor!
[31:32.64]For all this trouble you put me through, there's no way I am not going to find you and make you answer for your crimes.
[31:38.56]Yeah, I got my keycard.
[31:39.68]Shut up, lady.
[31:40.31]What do you know?
[31:42.79]This doesn't open, apparently.
[31:57.34]Plenty of health.
[31:58.26]Keep out.
[31:58.96]Yeah, we'll see.
[32:01.82]We'll see, dude.
[32:06.26]So this is like the doctor's little dungeon?
[32:09.77]Yeah.
[32:12.91]I want to go look at some of this stuff first.
[32:14.57]What if he's just sitting there eating potato chips?
[32:16.31]Can I just murder him?
[32:19.85]What does that do?
[32:22.97]What is this?
[32:25.51]I'm here.
[32:25.87]Never lose hospital.
[32:27.33]It's been a while.
[32:27.97]It feels like everyone's looking at me like they know what happened, what I did.
[32:31.08]I'm out of options.
[32:32.00]I have to hide here.
[32:34.64]Yeah.
[32:37.12]So this guy's a bad mother effer.
[32:40.18]He's been watching me.
[32:42.62]He made sure to cover tracks.
[32:45.76]Well, I'll make sure to cover... What's all this?
[32:51.33]This guy's a creep!
[32:56.19]What is that?
[32:57.33]Is that a picture of him and that girl?
[32:58.75]Alright.
[33:05.03]I'm coming for you!
[33:11.14]Plenty of ammunition.
[33:12.24]Plenty of health.
[33:14.36]Where you at?
[33:18.18]More ammunition.
[33:19.26]Wow, you're really stocking me up here, game.
[33:23.31]You're really stalking me up here.
[33:25.01]Let's move.
[33:27.81]There's a crane.
[33:36.06]What the hell is this thing?
[33:40.21]We've got like sick torture devices.
[33:42.11]This ball with spikes all over it.
[33:44.93]He's right there!
[33:45.85]He's right there!
[33:49.52]This is the core.
[33:51.24]I've worked on it for my entire life.
[33:53.47]It's beautiful, isn't it?
[33:54.59]No, it's actually kind of creepy.
[33:55.73]The biological civilization and history of the world has tried to control the human mind.
[34:00.47]Yeah, you... Nice job.
[34:01.33]I've done a few more modifications.
[34:04.15]I will have succeeded in less than one lifetime.
[34:07.65]You picked him off.
[34:08.18]Game over.
[34:09.14]They can't play around with it.
[34:12.22]For example... Oh, here, we got some friends for you.
[34:16.18]Yep.
[34:18.92]Wait, they're not real?
[34:20.32]So these things have not been real this whole time.
[34:26.51]You're dead, man.
[34:27.09]When I'm done with this, I'm going to come smash your head into that computer.
[34:34.79]What's over here?
[34:36.97]Oh, ammunition.
[34:41.07]Where'd that come?
[34:45.77]Turn this on.
[34:46.27]Whatever it is, I want to turn it on.
[34:50.04]What the hell are you doing?
[34:51.98]Well, even with 50% of the power, every core is still fully functional.
[34:55.75]I didn't need that shield anyway.
[34:57.13]I have a lot of other surprises.
[34:58.87]Yeah.
[34:59.55]You have a lot of surprises for me.
[35:01.83]Bro.
[35:02.41]I actually wasn't planning on using the pulse emitters, but you're leaving me no choice.
[35:06.13]Enjoy.
[35:08.19]This guy is messed up.
[35:10.15]You are messed up, dude.
[35:12.33]No.
[35:13.44]Maybe I just have to shoot this.
[35:17.36]No.
[35:17.58]I gotta get up there.
[35:18.94]How do I get up there?
[35:21.95]Oh, ooh, okay.
[35:23.65]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get ya, I get ya.
[35:26.42]Gotta break this stuff, you gotta break this stuff.
[35:28.72]Oh my god, break it.
[35:31.32]Break the supports.
[35:35.54]Oh, he's blowing me around like crazy.
[35:39.92]It's alright, it's alright.
[35:41.68]Get these supports!
[35:45.02]Machine gun, activate!
[35:49.94]Come on, break.
[35:50.84]You know, I'm just gonna shoot him.
[35:51.84]That'll break him, won't it?
[35:54.45]No, it won't.
[35:57.07]Take out one.
[35:57.51]Take out one.
[35:58.61]Yes!
[36:00.91]Take them all out.
[36:02.97]Come on!
[36:07.27]Oh, I need more health.
[36:10.05]There we are.
[36:12.11]Perfect.
[36:13.47]Double-barreled shotgun.
[36:14.51]That's not the shotgun.
[36:15.21]That's the SMG.
[36:15.85]Where'd that guy even go?
[36:21.95]Stop doing the pulse!
[36:22.75]The pulse is what- I need to- I need to time it.
[36:28.93]Get!
[36:29.49]Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[36:31.37]Oh my god, this is so ridiculous!
[36:33.05]These things take so long to break!
[36:36.21]More, more, more, more, more, more, more!
[36:39.49]You bastard.
[36:42.39]Go, go, go, need health, need health, need health.
[36:45.03]It's alright, it was over here, it was over here, it was over here.
[36:51.15]Where was it?
[36:51.57]Over here.
[36:56.44]Bang.
[36:56.98]Wait, where am I going?
[36:59.60]What's going on?
[37:01.08]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:04.70]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[37:07.76]What the hell is going on?
[37:11.91]Hey, yeah, help me.
[37:16.01]Okay.
[37:16.29]Oh, it can be.
[37:23.41]How come there's still a shield on it?
[37:27.55]I can't get in there.
[37:30.33]Where's the other power supply?
[37:34.73]Do I have to turn it off again?
[37:35.65]No, it's like already off.
[37:42.15]Get away from me!
[37:43.90]Double barrel shotgun in your face!
[37:48.16]Here we go.
[37:52.64]Go, go, go, go, go.
[37:55.50]Break, break, break.
[37:57.65]That's it.
[37:58.27]Come on.
[37:59.87]One more.
[38:00.79]One more little support.
[38:04.49]One more side.
[38:05.13]Here it is.
[38:11.34]Yes, I can.
[38:12.24]I can destroy whatever I feel like.
[38:16.46]Hey.
[38:17.58]Whoa.
[38:21.20]That door doesn't work.
[38:23.77]That door doesn't work.
[38:26.29]That- There's only one left!
[38:30.41]What?
[38:30.75]Where am I supposed to go?
[38:35.04]Um... Hello?
[38:38.58]Oh, there's a door.
[38:39.86]Ha ha!
[38:44.30]Blood covers the walls.
[38:46.74]Hey!
[38:48.52]Stop doing that.
[38:52.50]Stop!
[38:54.85]It's those mannequins again.
[38:55.97]Those little dummies.
[38:59.49]My eyes.
[39:00.69]I'm so scared.
[39:01.29]I don't want... Duh!
[39:08.51]God, you stupid mannequins.
[39:10.57]No, nothing behind me.
[39:13.33]I'm starting to sweat a little bit here.
[39:14.53]This is getting intense.
[39:19.87]Even if you prepare for it, it still haunts your every move.
[39:27.89]Real door.
[39:28.53]No, not... Enough with the fake doors.
[39:32.55]Whoa, my whole world is crumbling.
[39:34.23]Hey, I'm back.
[39:42.32]I'm back.
[39:43.96]How are you, sir?
[39:45.82]Hello.
[39:46.14]Uh-oh.
[39:58.15]Don't say that.
[40:00.08]Don't you dare say that.
[40:03.32]She's my friend, man.
[40:07.98]And your little construction is gonna be gone.
[40:12.02]For good.
[40:13.92]See ya later.
[40:14.92]Goodbye.
[40:15.80]It's now gone.
[40:16.58]At the cost of my own life, pretty much.
[40:19.03]It's over.
[40:21.77]I'm just gonna start knocking my mic waving at this guy.
[40:28.74]I'm gonna die if I'm not careful here.
[40:30.26]I thought I already knocked that over.
[40:35.50]Now what are you doing?
[40:37.78]Oh, more like nightmares.
[40:44.60]Get out of the way!
[40:51.39]Even the cops are coming.
[40:53.03]Hey, hello!
[41:01.08]What is going on?
[41:04.76]Get up!
[41:05.84]Pull yourself up, man!
[41:11.68]Did I make it?
[41:14.00]How funny is that?
[41:14.60]Like, you heard the sirens there, now you hear the sirens here.
[41:18.19]See, there, they were coming, they came from my house, and they came right to here.
[41:27.31]Any more health?
[41:32.46]Too close to the core.
[41:41.98]I'm not giving up.
[41:43.48]I'm gonna break that last little thingamajiggy.
[41:47.00]And then we're gonna have tea and crumpets.
[41:49.78]Me and my new friend.
[41:53.59]Wait, what?
[41:56.03]The final support!
[41:57.95]See you later.
[42:00.64]Bye!
[42:02.38]Shoot the core for good measure!
[42:07.75]Yes!
[42:11.07]Did I win?
[42:13.37]Did I win?
[42:17.99]Kind of.
[42:20.73]What does he want?
[42:21.81]You didn't win.
[42:29.60]Oh, it shut off right when you were saying that.
[42:33.08]Oh my god, what?!
[42:42.06]Oh my god!
[42:58.47]Alright.
[43:05.54]What a cold bitch.
[43:08.14]Hey, hey, listen lady.
[43:09.86]I... Okay, you're welcome.
[43:16.27]You're welcome.
[43:17.57]For a second I thought she was gonna throw me around like, uh... What was his name there?
[43:23.69]The Cyber Ninja from Metal Gear Solid.
[43:28.13]Well, that's it.
[43:30.13]Nightmare House 2 is officially completed.
[43:32.00]I think.
[43:33.80]Unless something else ridiculous happens.
[43:37.12]Don't think so.
[43:40.17]Yeah, that's it.
[43:40.91]I think that's it, guys.
[43:42.87]Yeah, I'm hitting enter.
[43:43.51]I'm hitting space.
[43:44.23]Escape.
[43:44.59]Click, click.
[43:45.03]Just looks like the credits.
[43:47.06]So, yeah.
[43:47.34]I hope you enjoyed this triple episode.
[43:50.20]This is probably going to be pretty long.
[43:51.82]But, yeah.
[43:52.98]This is a pretty cool game.
[43:54.26]Pretty cool mod.
[43:55.08]Again, you have to have Half-Life 2 Episode 2.
