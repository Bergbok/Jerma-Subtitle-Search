[00:02.19]Hey, what is going on, you ghouls and ghosts?
[00:06.08]It's me, Jerma, from the past or the future.
[00:10.80]No, I'm really just... I'm kind of just here in the present.
[00:13.14]But we're on Man Manor tonight for a live commentary, getting in the Halloween spirit more and more every day.
[00:19.73]Seems like everybody is playing this map, by the way.
[00:22.89]Everybody's playing Man Manor to get themselves pumped for the Halloween update, and to get themselves pumped in general for Halloween, which is awesome.
[00:30.64]If you are unfamiliar, this map is the Halloween update map from last year.
[00:35.66]It's got, like, you know, pieces of pie, pumpkin pie, like, candy and stuff like that.
[00:39.75]It's all over the place.
[00:40.45]And where is everybody?
[00:42.11]Kind of weird.
[00:43.19]Getting on the point right now.
[00:45.63]There's plenty of people on each team.
[00:46.99]Uh-oh, Angie.
[00:47.89]Oh, I'm done.
[00:49.79]I'm dead.
[00:51.31]Maybe I'm dead.
[00:52.35]So, this is the update map, like I said.
[00:54.53]Everyone's playing it.
[00:55.25]This is the map where this huge boss comes out.
[00:59.18]If you haven't played this map, play it at least in the next couple days, in the next week or something like that, because it's very, very fun.
[01:06.24]See, look, look, everything's like candy and stuff.
[01:08.27]Mmm, delicious candy.
[01:09.67]Whoa, I'm being an idiot.
[01:11.35]Not paying any attention.
[01:12.31]Oh, let's go.
[01:12.81]Bring it on, Pierrot.
[01:14.11]Let's go, Mr. Pierrot.
[01:16.65]Oh, you're gonna get away, are you?
[01:18.47]No, you are not.
[01:19.23]Give me that health.
[01:20.44]Oh, we got crits, baby.
[01:23.38]Oh, don't you jump in the air on that one.
[01:25.42]Oh, God.
[01:26.18]Speaking of crits, he has... Oh, God.
[01:27.84]All right, we got it, we got it.
[01:30.42]Let's get on it.
[01:32.00]So, yeah, a giant boss will appear.
[01:33.80]He's the headless, haunted headless horseman.
[01:37.18]Hold on, let me get this right.
[01:38.42]He is the horseless headless horseman.
[01:40.76]There we go.
[01:42.10]He appears, and he just melee one-hit kills every single person.
[01:46.01]It's awesome.
[01:47.36]It can get really, really annoying, though.
[01:49.66]I will say that it can get fairly obnoxious if you're trying to play.
[01:54.67]Let's say you're doing a great round.
[01:56.75]Like, oh, I just killed 12 people.
[01:58.65]Oh, here comes the friggin' monster that's going to kill us all.
[02:02.81]It's like, great.
[02:04.33]That's exactly what I needed.
[02:06.48]Oh, God.
[02:06.82]Here we go.
[02:07.68]We're doing all right.
[02:08.68]Let's keep moving.
[02:10.10]Let's keep moving.
[02:10.98]Oh, crit bomb.
[02:12.00]Crit bomb.
[02:13.50]Oh, come on now.
[02:16.38]Oh, he got away.
[02:19.55]I'm actually gonna... I'm at the last point.
[02:22.05]Oh, they got a teleporter.
[02:23.49]I'm gonna sneak on him.
[02:27.20]And there it goes.
[02:28.70]I didn't do it.
[02:30.02]I didn't do it.
[02:32.50]Get that candy.
[02:34.42]So if you guys were wondering what I was being for Halloween, me and a couple of other buddies are going to die.
[02:43.44]We're going to be the Ninja Turtles for Halloween.
[02:46.36]So it should be very, very fun.
[02:48.30]We have like a whole huge getup already made.
[02:51.23]It's going to be crazy.
[02:52.43]Oh, he got the candy.
[02:54.69]Oh, damn.
[02:56.43]It's going to be pretty crazy.
[02:57.27]We'll be in the Ninja Turtles, all four Ninja Turtles, and one of our other friends is going to be Splinter.
[03:03.10]So we're going to go out into the town, probably go into downtown Boston.
[03:07.12]Be crazy, have some fun, just like how you should on Halloween.
[03:11.25]Don't get too crazy, though.
[03:12.47]You know, don't, like, go egg in somebody's house or something because that's not cool.
[03:16.87]Where am I going?
[03:17.75]I keep on going way past the point.
[03:20.83]And I keep on forgetting to not switch this.
[03:25.04]Oh, there he is.
[03:25.72]Oh, my God, there he is.
[03:26.46]There he is.
[03:27.80]If you've never seen him before, there he is.
[03:30.65]He's running around chasing somebody.
[03:32.35]I want to get a good look at him.
[03:35.09]Where is he?
[03:35.54]Oh, there he is.
[03:37.30]And if you kill him with a melee kill, you get this... Oh, God, I'm it.
[03:42.86]He's coming after me now.
[03:44.05]Let's see if I can just start smashing him.
[03:46.70]Oh, God.
[03:47.86]Pretty much this is where they got the idea for the Saxon Hail mod.
[03:51.87]So if you're a fan of the Saxon Hail mod, this is pretty much its roots.
[03:56.17]Because people said, wow, that's pretty funny.
[03:58.47]And that's pretty fun.
[03:59.43]What if that person was player controlled?
[04:02.10]And that's, I guess, where Saxon Hail was kind of born, the mod.
[04:06.14]So let's get on.
[04:07.00]Can we even cap this point before I end this gameplay?
[04:09.48]Apparently not.
[04:10.22]Uh-oh, lag.
[04:13.45]Lag.
[04:16.76]So, yeah, what are you guys doing for Halloween?
[04:18.26]Have you guys figured out what you were doing yet?
[04:21.32]I'm kind of wondering.
[04:22.80]Because I know some of you guys gave me your ideas, and some of them were actually pretty good.
[04:26.86]Some... Oh, God.
[04:31.12]Oh, what?
[04:32.36]What the hell?
[04:33.92]Did he just, like, rage DC?
[04:35.50]What was that?
[04:36.00]Oh, I gotta get him.
[04:43.99]He doesn't even know where I am.
[04:45.19]He doesn't even know where I am.
[04:49.89]All right, we got the point.
[04:50.69]We got it.
[04:51.17]Let's go.
[04:54.89]Oh, boy.
[04:56.76]Oh, can I get it?
[04:57.56]Can I get it?
[04:58.12]Keep moving.
[04:58.64]Keep moving.
[05:00.30]Keep moving.
[05:00.84]Give me those crits.
[05:02.86]Give me those mini crits.
[05:05.28]All right.
[05:06.58]We're good to go.
[05:09.29]Oh, my God.
[05:10.51]Out of nowhere.
[05:12.23]Oh, you want to go melee up in here?
[05:14.37]You want to go melee up in here?
[05:17.15]Oh, boy.
[05:18.31]Somebody's spamming from somewhere.
[05:20.13]That soldier.
[05:20.77]Come on.
[05:21.03]Keep me alive.
[05:21.53]Where's the candy?
[05:22.67]Where's the candy?
[05:24.73]Oh, boy.
[05:25.08]Oh, boy.
[05:25.38]Oh, boy.
[05:25.66]Come on, Capit.
[05:26.20]Come on.
[05:26.66]Come on.
[05:26.90]I don't have much time.
[05:27.82]Not much time.
[05:31.08]Oh, give me that.
[05:31.90]Give me that thing.
[05:35.02]We got it.
[05:36.50]We got this.
[05:38.55]And... Uh-oh.
[05:39.99]Haunted gift.
[05:40.59]There we go.
[05:42.43]Blow up that stuff.
[05:44.57]Oh, my God.
[05:45.05]Sentry.
[05:45.19]Sentry.
[05:46.39]And a spy.
[05:48.59]I got an achievement!
[05:49.85]Nice!
[05:51.27]A TACO lantern.
[05:52.23]I think we're about to win this game.
[05:55.53]But yeah, the Halloween update is supposed to come out, I think, either tomorrow or the next day.
[06:00.17]Today is Tuesday.
[06:02.25]So yeah, it should be exciting.
[06:03.81]I saw the pyro face thing with the horns and the wings.
[06:07.68]That's going to be pretty ridiculous.
[06:09.06]Hopefully, hopefully, they add some of that crazy stuff and we get some... Oh, hey, what's going on, sniper?
[06:16.41]Hopefully they add some crazy stuff.
[06:17.75]I want new weapons, like I said.
[06:18.97]I want new weapons.
[06:20.27]New weapons.
[06:22.35]Oh, let's do some dancing.
[06:23.46]Let's do some dancing.
[06:25.36]Oh, give me that.
[06:26.10]It's over.
[06:26.50]If I pick this up, it's pretty much over.
[06:29.06]Oh, it's over.
[06:31.38]It's over.
[06:32.96]Oh, might as well taunt.
[06:34.50]Oh, my God.
[06:35.42]Get it.
[06:36.16]No.
[06:38.98]Oh, you got to be kidding.
[06:40.14]We got it.
[06:40.68]Nice.
[06:42.22]And top frag.
[06:42.87]Cool.
[06:43.80]But, yeah, hopefully you guys have a good, safe Halloween.
[06:46.43]I got a very special video going up in the next couple days.
[06:49.41]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[06:52.40]Take care, everybody.
