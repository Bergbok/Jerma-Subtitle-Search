[00:14.21]And the Steam machines?
[00:16.12]That was a fucking waste of time, huh, Valve?
[00:20.28]You could have made, like, a fucking update to one of your games.
[00:22.66]You could have made a new game.
[00:23.64]Instead, you made, like, a bunch of useless hardware that nobody cares about.
[00:27.05]Where's the fucking video games, Valve?
[00:28.47]What have you done?
[00:42.36]Hardware is the future now.

[07:12.44]I get it.
[07:12.74]We're going to go up the loop-de-loop.
[07:15.06]Over here.
[07:15.34]Look at this one.
[07:23.55]Five fucking... 35 million points.
[07:32.65]I guarantee it'll be funny if I join his game.
[07:34.67]Well, maybe.
[07:35.07]I don't know.
[07:44.47]We were just playing the Tony.
[07:46.10]I wish the game didn't crash.
[07:48.36]Finally, I just fucking saved it, man.
[07:49.78]Like, I... But those old games... Alright, well, that was fun.
[08:00.15]What a stunt.
[08:02.19]Press V. I want to try one more thing in this game.
[08:15.83]What have I done?
[08:17.47]I'm getting a bunch of fucking mods.
[08:18.80]I'm downloading a bunch of viruses to play with this guy.
[08:22.26]And the game... It was a bunch of fucking viruses because it just crashed my computer and I have no access to my mouse.
[08:30.91]That's just fantastic.
[08:31.93]We're doing a fucking 10 out of 10 tonight.
[08:38.55]I hope this doesn't kill the stream.
[08:40.23]Because it might.
[08:40.79]It's one of those straight up unhandled exceptions.
[08:44.33]If the stream dies, then I will see you guys tomorrow.
[08:48.94]We're going to start something very special.
[08:51.04]You guys are going to fucking like it.
[08:52.44]I guarantee it.
[08:53.16]It's going to be a fucking fun stream.
[08:55.78]Guarantee that tomorrow's stream is going to be fucking 10 out of 10.
[08:58.04]Don't miss it.
[08:59.33]I'm about to click OK on the unhandled exception.
[09:03.71]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[09:04.63]If we crash, if not, then we don't.
[09:07.93]Before I grow, before I grow.
[09:13.10]Thank you, Mostly Lost, for the multiple $3.42.
[09:17.32]Bring the music back.
[09:18.20]Turn on the webcam and put on your keyboard.
[09:20.30]We want to see how the fuck you use your hands with the keyboard.
[09:22.74]Fine.
[09:23.92]I'll do that.
[09:26.32]We'll go over that.
[09:27.30]We'll end this with IRL.
[09:29.20]I'm not going to click OK on the unhandled exception.
[09:32.08]I'm going to keep this virus error on my screen.
[09:34.87]We're going to do a... No, my keyboard is so dirty.
[09:37.85]That is a mistake.
[09:38.97]There's like food and hair.
[09:42.05]This is like the grossest keyboard you have ever seen.
[09:45.29]This is like fucking coffee and shit on here.
[09:47.24]This is... What have I said?
[09:48.82]I don't know why I just told you guys I was going to do this.
[09:53.20]There's like rice in here.
[09:55.46]There's rice in here.
[09:58.28]I don't know how it got in here.
[10:02.08]What the fuck even is this?
[10:05.74]Now, we're going to end the stream with IRL.
[10:09.10]Let me just clean my keyboard up a little bit.
[10:11.17]I'll be right back.
[10:12.81]We're going to end with IRL.
[10:15.25]Hand IRL stream, okay?
[10:17.87]Be right back.
