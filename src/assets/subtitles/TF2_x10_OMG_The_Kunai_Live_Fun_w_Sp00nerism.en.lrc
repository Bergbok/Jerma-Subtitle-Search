[00:09.43]Everything is multiplied by 10.
[00:11.97]I've heard about this.
[00:12.81]I've seen people play it.
[00:13.91]It's supposed to be crazy.
[00:15.01]I'm going Demoknight.
[00:16.45]And here we go.
[00:19.01]Oh, I thought someone was going to be right there.
[00:23.05]I got somebody.
[00:24.37]Retrieving server info.
[00:25.87]They're being short.
[00:28.85]I'm so scared.
[00:29.77]I just have no idea what I'm in store for here.
[00:33.33]All I know is it's nuts.
[00:35.81]Ow.
[00:39.35]Who has the Jurati every three seconds?
[00:43.29]What is happening?
[00:44.07]I'm gonna have the coolest intro ever.
[00:46.21]I didn't even hit that guy!
[00:48.45]Haha.
[00:53.15]I'm gonna be like... Actually, I'll just do it when I'm in the game and then I start recording.
[00:59.96]It's gonna be funny.
[01:02.28]I wonder how much health I can have as a Demoknight like this.
[01:05.66]And how fast I can run.
[01:09.44]Oh, man.
[01:10.57]As a scout, the Shortstop and pistol share the same ammo.
[01:16.11]You can't even walk over there.
[01:17.79]Be mindful of your ammo.
[01:21.01]While you both have equipped.
[01:23.36]While you have both equipped.
[01:24.40]Wow.
[01:25.02]There's rockets launching in all directions.
[01:29.42]You're in?
[01:30.04]Sick.
[01:30.40]Three, two, one.
[01:33.17]Hey guys, what's going on?
[01:33.96]I'm playing TF2 because you guys were like, hey, uh, playing with Jervis.
[01:36.96]So I'm like, okay, Jervis, you wanna play some TF2?
[01:38.96]And he's like, yeah, dude.
[01:40.02]And then we're playing TF2, so here we are.
[01:41.86]Yeah, dude.
[01:43.98]I was trying to do the impression.
[01:50.25]I'm never gonna be able to get out of here and get stabbed.
[01:52.42]I got a double kill.
[01:53.26]Oh my god, I did it.
[01:54.50]Oh my god, dude.
[01:55.24]Time for a rampage.
[01:57.41]It is time for a complete rampage.
[01:59.79]Oh man.
[02:00.37]It's time for a complete rampage.
[02:03.67]Are you serious?
[02:05.87]I just don't want to get backstabbed.
[02:10.24]This is insanity, man.
[02:13.02]Nobody can kill me.
[02:14.82]Unkillable.
[02:16.18]I'm unkillable.
[02:17.92]I am legitimately unkillable.
[02:20.84]How come?
[02:21.26]Because I have this thing.
[02:26.33]Shit.
[02:28.95]No, I got backstabbed by a spy.
[02:30.77]Shit.
[02:33.83]Did you get a lot of kills?
[02:35.19]I did.
[02:36.25]I did.
[02:36.51]Damn.
[02:37.89]I had just about 2,000.
[02:38.94]I was still trying to... Jeez, what the why?
[02:44.30]Jeez, what the why?
[02:46.55]Why do you have so much health?
[02:48.47]Oh, not anymore.
[02:51.35]Aww.
[02:53.52]Wait, you're Demoman, right?
[02:55.16]Yeah.
[02:56.56]Yeah, that's right.
[02:57.06]You go, do, do, do.
[03:00.48]It won't blow up, and I'm right-clicking.
[03:03.50]Uh, I don't know.
[03:05.00]That doesn't seem right.
[03:06.87]Yeah, it doesn't.
[03:07.43]What the hell?
[03:07.89]Look at all these explosions.
[03:11.91]I'll see you later.
[03:13.31]You fell and died.
[03:14.87]Ah, fuck!
[03:18.51]Give me that kill!
[03:19.49]Yeah, I have like so many of them and they won't... Do I have to wait a while?
[03:24.27]I'm in a really good position right now.
[03:25.85]No, you sh- Maybe it's because of that item?
[03:28.64]Maybe, I don't know.
[03:31.30]Ah, okay.
[03:31.82]I got some- Ah, jeez!
[03:32.88]I just barely noticed this guy was trying to attack me!
[03:34.72]Don't get away from me!
[03:37.00]You got peed on!
[03:41.08]Dear.
[03:41.38]This is bad.
[03:44.70]This is bad for him.
[03:47.18]Why do I have this much health?
[03:48.60]This just seems so unbelievably ridiculous.
[03:55.85]How did I not kill him?
[03:58.49]Alright, buddy.
[03:59.13]You know what?
[03:59.57]We're doing this.
[04:00.05]I don't even have to disguise anymore.
[04:07.42]I don't...
[04:09.55]Come on, blow up!
[04:13.93]It doesn't matter!
[04:15.51]I'm invincible!
[04:17.59]You can't defeat me!
[04:19.04]You're insane.
[04:21.54]If you could only see the insanity that was just my screen.
[04:25.98]I'll check out the video.
[04:30.98]Oh, man.
[04:31.40]Sorry, you wanna- Just come and hit me.
[04:32.96]Fine, you know- Oh, wow.
[04:34.38]You're dead.
[04:35.68]This guy's gonna die too.
[04:36.25]I'm not dead.
[04:37.11]Oh, not you.
[04:38.03]These people.
[04:40.62]I just don't want to get backstabbed.
[04:41.60]I just see gentlemans like flying in the sky and shit.
[04:44.43]I'm so confused.
[04:46.73]As long as I do not get backstabbed, I will live forever.
[04:50.19]Cause I'm just gonna face stab people and stuff.
[04:56.21]Oh man.
[04:58.32]What is it?
[04:58.74]Why does my gun glow?
[05:00.08]I don't get this.
[05:02.00]What is it?
[05:03.18]My gun glows like neon blue, green, whatever.
[05:07.32]Oh, I'm losing health!
[05:08.10]Losing health quick!
[05:09.42]No, I died!
[05:10.10]Uh, mini-crits.
[05:14.32]Oh, mini-crits?
[05:16.02]Yeah, I don't know anything about this game.
[05:19.78]I got switched.
[05:20.55]I got switched.
[05:21.11]I'm on... I'm on... I'm on... I'm on red.
[05:24.49]Where are we going?
[05:27.25]We are going... I forgot this map.
[05:29.37]...to A. Come with me to A. We are gonna defend A by ourselves.
[05:33.77]We're gonna defend A by ourselves?
[05:35.27]Yes.
[05:37.04]We're gonna defend A by ourselves, and we're gonna stick a middle finger into the blue team, because they're gonna get 150,000 crits.
[05:47.14]Oh dear, you can do that too.
[05:48.47]Yeah, with the other one.
[05:51.87]I'm gonna have... Keep coming this way.
[05:53.97]I have a, uh... I'm gonna have a crits for you, like, every 15 seconds.
[05:59.57]Follow me, follow me, Spoon.
[06:00.57]Oh, you have to look at them.
[06:01.63]I'm so dumb.
[06:02.35]They come from here.
[06:05.05]See, like, up there?
[06:05.73]Alright, Spoon, come over here, and do hold the button down and shoot a bunch of them into... Shoot all those grenades into that door.
[06:12.76]Oh, to the right, to the right, to the right!
[06:14.02]Oh, jeez.
[06:14.52]Oh, jeez.
[06:14.86]Take care of the other one.
[06:15.76]Are you ready?
[06:16.58]Here we go.
[06:17.36]Kill him!
[06:18.48]Oh, they ubered!
[06:21.51]No!
[06:21.77]Get back!
[06:22.19]Crits won't save us now!
[06:24.41]Get back, you don't know me like that.
[06:26.93]Get back, you don't know me like that!
[06:29.33]We gotta shoot the million of them.
[06:33.54]I can't, I can't, I can't.
[06:34.50]How are you still alive?
[06:35.62]How is he not killing you?
[06:37.88]Oh, Demoknight.
[06:39.06]Random Demoknight appeared.
[06:39.94]Random Demoknight.
[06:42.70]No, no!
[06:43.85]I had a crit too.
[06:46.23]Ugh.
[06:47.55]Dude, how much health was I healing you for?
[06:49.46]You were not dying.
[06:51.84]I wasn't.
[06:52.82]Alright, come on out.
[06:54.00]I got a crits for you.
[06:56.46]Damn it.
[06:58.43]Can't believe they haven't capped B yet.
[06:59.49]That's pretty surprising.
[07:02.35]Because I'm working my ass off over here.
[07:03.99]It's just me.
[07:04.97]No one else exists.
[07:06.01]Let's see how this works.
[07:09.31]What on Earth is this?
[07:11.35]What is going?
[07:12.47]What?
[07:13.03]You?
[07:16.57]What on Earth?
[07:17.47]What is going?
[07:20.03]Ah, I know.
[07:20.99]He's just shooting me up in the air.
[07:22.59]What a jerk.
[07:23.31]He was just launching all over the place.
[07:25.50]Just spinning around.
[07:26.48]Oh, what's that baby's bazooka?
[07:33.06]I get it.
