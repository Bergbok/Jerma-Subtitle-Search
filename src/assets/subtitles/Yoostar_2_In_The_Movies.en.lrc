[00:59.69]Hi, everybody.
[01:02.45]You know me.
[01:03.57]It's your good friend, Jeremy.
[01:06.93]I'm late.
[01:07.59]Well, I'm one minute late.
[01:09.39]This setup was annoying to do, and it might not even work.
[01:11.99]Who gives a shit, right?
[01:14.21]This might not even be set up correctly, but I think it is.
[01:17.67]Enough for it to be worth playing, I think.
[01:21.59]Anyways, we're going to play.
[01:22.67]First, we're going to start with You Star in the Movies 2.
[01:27.09]So I don't know anything about this game.
[01:31.67]All I know is it puts you in old movies and you have to act in them.
[01:34.85]So I have no fucking idea.
[01:38.57]I'm going to finish the setup.
[01:39.77]I'll be back in like 30 seconds and we'll get started.
[02:20.11]Okay.
[02:20.95]Let's cut this.
[02:23.27]Bring this over here.
[02:26.38]And this probably needs to be a little bit louder.
[02:27.92]Because it is about what's on the screen, right?
[02:32.86]So I'm not going to really be able to see my screen.
[02:37.06]So Chad, I'm going to have to lean in from time to time to see what you guys are saying.
[02:42.39]But anyways.
[02:44.75]Here we go.
[02:45.77]You star in the movies.
[02:49.07]You know what?
[02:49.87]Let's just sit here for a second.
[02:51.45]I just made a tweet.
[02:54.06]You know what?
[02:54.40]I'm going to grab a drink.
[02:55.36]Hey, by the way, grab yourself a nice drink.
[02:57.20]If you're over the age of fucking 28 and you're of legal drinking age, let's have a couple of drinks.
[03:01.81]Let's have some fun tonight.
[03:02.65]How does that sound?
[03:03.73]Sounds good to me.
[03:04.99]I'll be right back.
[03:06.23]Starting soon.
[04:28.80]Alright, let's go.
[04:31.26]I'm ready.
[04:33.10]I've got my extended extension cord in my ear.
[04:36.80]I'm ready for You Star in the Movies 2!
[04:39.96]By the way, I was looking up online.
[04:41.82]Where, uh... Where the fuck is You Star in the Movies 1?
[04:47.13]It doesn't exist.
[04:49.53]There is no You Star in the Movies 1.
[04:51.25]Now, hopefully you guys can hear me, too.
[04:54.83]Oh, well.
[04:56.15]Here we go.
[04:58.37]Start it.
[05:01.13]I'm ready.
[05:02.29]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[05:03.27]Let's aim this at the camera.
[05:05.72]You got it.
[05:08.84]Welcome to You Star 2.
[05:10.20]Oh, here we go.
[05:12.96]You.
[05:13.92]Me.
[05:14.48]You Star 2 lets you step into the movies.
[05:16.72]Oh, I can't wait to step into the fucking film industry.
[05:18.86]Please step out of the camera view for a moment and then press the X button.
[05:21.91]Hold on a second.
[05:23.25]Wait, can you guys hear this?
[05:44.01]Okay, hold on.
[05:45.49]So, you're gonna have to deal with it.
[05:49.77]You're gonna have to deal with it!
[05:51.79]Is this right?
[05:54.15]Is this correct?
[05:56.20]No, I think it has to be, right?
[06:03.33]Am I synced up right here?
[06:04.41]Alright, whatever.
[06:05.35]He wants me to get out of the way.
[06:09.51]And now, step back in.
[06:14.56]That's pretty cool, huh?
[06:16.88]Before we get started, a quick note on lighting.
[06:20.24]This girl is perfect.
[06:21.02]Whoa, I'm in the middle of fucking downtown LA.
[06:23.68]Look at these cars, man.
[06:24.62]Try adjusting the light settings in your room.
[06:27.59]Once you're happy with the lighting, try not to change it in mid-shoot, okay?
[06:31.95]Let's get you into position.
[06:33.13]Get me into position.
[06:33.77]As you play U-Star 2, you'll often need to select your character and get ready to perform.
[06:38.78]This is called framing up.
[06:40.26]Yeah.
[06:41.44]When you see an outline like this, try to stand so that you match the frame as closely as possible.
[06:46.36]Try it now.
[06:48.11]Perfect.
[06:48.97]When the outline fills, you're locked into that role.
[06:52.53]Excellent.
[06:53.53]If there are two outlines on the screen, you can frame up as either character or get a friend to frame up alongside you.
[06:59.66]Remember the color that fills your outline.
[07:01.58]You'll need this later.
[07:02.58]Okay.
[07:05.15]Let's get to reading your lines.
[07:09.52]Where the fuck am I?
[07:10.82]This is exciting.
[07:12.06]What?
[07:12.16]Okay.
[07:27.51]Try uploading your scenes to share with friends anywhere in the world on Facebook, Twitter, or at uStar.com.
[07:33.05]You can earn awards, rate performances, and increase your fame to unlock cool content online at Facebook.com forward slash uStar.
[07:43.19]Check out the uStore, where scenes and scene packs are made available all the time.
[07:48.89]That's all.
[07:49.39]You're on your way to becoming a Hollywood superstar.
[07:51.79]Don't you fucking take any pictures of me!
[07:55.87]Uh, no, I don't need to know the tutorial, okay.
[08:00.61]So what do I do?
[08:05.60]Alright, let's go over here.
[08:10.18]View store.

[08:40.94]Oh my god, 300, okay.
[08:42.24]Sure, oh god.
[08:44.28]Choose your next words carefully, dear knight.
[08:48.86]They may be your last.
[08:49.60]Don't tell me.
[08:50.64]I don't want to do this.
[08:51.42]This is from... Mad Men.
[08:53.52]Oh, God.
[08:53.90]This is from, like, fucking 2010, isn't it?
[08:56.14]Okay, let's do it.
[08:58.74]Choose your next words carefully.
[09:01.28]Scripted.
[09:01.68]We're going to go with scripted.
[09:02.96]They may be your last.
[09:04.29]Let's just have some fun.
[09:05.09]Okay, here we go.
[09:08.59]Choose your shot.
[09:09.47]I want to be the guy that kicks, right?
[09:12.68]Here's some tips to help you get the best experience.
[09:15.98]Take care not to cast a shadow in the scene.
[09:19.64]Well, okay.
[09:20.58]Here's some tips.
[09:21.46]Any movement within the camera's view will appear on the screen.
[09:24.40]Curtains blowing in the breeze.
[09:26.10]There's no breezes here, don't worry.
[09:28.64]Once the background record shot has been taken, try not to change the lighting.
[09:32.39]That's not gonna happen either.
[09:35.17]Okay, well, I'm gonna be him.
[09:37.71]I'm gonna be King Leonardo.
[09:39.92]Please clear the scene so we can pick a backdrop.
[09:41.92]You know what's gonna fuck this all up is my, like... Okay, scene's clear.
[09:45.45]Position yourself within the actor guidelines to select your role.
[09:54.09]Like this.
[09:56.31]Okay, this is not where he was.
[09:58.51]Wait, what?
[10:02.00]Wait, what?
[10:06.02]Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas.
[10:09.95]They may be your last as king.
[10:14.79]I've only chosen my words carefully, Persian.
[10:17.87]Perhaps you should have done the same.
[10:20.73]This is blasphemy!
[10:22.09]This is madness!
[10:27.10]Madness?
[10:27.76]This... This... is Sparta!
[10:38.88]Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas.
[10:42.96]They may be your last as king.
[10:46.49]Madman.
[10:47.53]I've only chosen my words carefully, Persian.
[10:50.57]Perhaps you should have done the same.
[10:53.61]This is blasphemy.
[10:55.13]This is madness.
[10:59.63]And this, this, this is Sparta.
[11:16.05]That's the first one we have we have like 80 more things to do
[11:30.60]I got the creative thing, new scene.
[11:32.00]Alright, save and upload.
[11:34.22]I'm not fucking uploading that shit.
[11:36.90]Alright, now let's be on the other side.
[11:38.14]Let's be on the other side.
[11:39.06]So this time I'm gonna be the other guy.
[11:41.34]I'm gonna do script again.
[11:41.88]Okay, so now I have to be facing like this way.
[11:44.19]Let's be this guy.
[11:57.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:59.57]I don't want to be him again.
[12:00.53]I don't want to be him again.
[12:01.43]Go back.
[12:02.47]Go back.
[12:02.83]I don't want to be King Leonidas again.
[12:04.23]I wanted to select the other guy.
[12:07.17]No, what the fuck?
[12:08.37]I want to go back.
[12:09.73]I don't want to do this again.
[12:16.86]God damn it.
[12:17.36]Okay, I gotta be good this time.
[12:22.83]I'm not gonna look at the screen.
[12:25.15]Choose.
[12:26.30]Your next words carefully, Leonidas.
[12:29.32]They may be your last as king.
[12:32.90]Madman.
[12:34.40]Madman, you say?
[12:36.03]This is not madness.
[12:37.49]This, in fact, is my town.
[12:39.19]It's my city.
[12:40.01]This is blasphemy.
[12:41.61]This is madness.
[12:42.37]Madness, you say?
[12:43.19]This is my town.
[12:50.84]Now you go.
[12:55.73]Oscar!
[12:58.15]Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas.
[13:01.41]I'm looking in the wrong direction.
[13:02.33]They may be your last as king.
[13:05.50]Madman.
[13:07.24]Madman, you say?
[13:08.18]This is not madness.
[13:10.24]This, in fact, is my town.
[13:11.92]It's my city.
[13:12.74]This is blasphemy.
[13:14.54]This is madness.
[13:15.04]Madness, you say?
[13:15.86]This is my town.
[13:36.59]That's fucking so dumb.
[13:38.65]How has it taken me this long to enjoy this video game?
[13:43.87]I don't know.
[13:45.63]It's even better the second time.
[13:47.07]I don't wanna do that again.
[13:48.27]I wanna fucking keep going.
[13:52.59]You know, let's get the fuck away from 300.
[13:54.43]How about it?
[13:55.61]That's probably a good idea.
[13:58.20]Along Came Polly, American Pie, Angels and Demons.
[14:02.94]Holy shit, man.
[14:03.85]There's so many stupid fucking movies here.
[14:06.31]Baby Mama.
[14:07.07]No.
[14:07.21]Beverly Hills Cop?
[14:08.11]Oh my god, do I get to be the waiter?
[14:10.97]This apparently is hard.
[14:13.79]I don't want to do that.
[14:27.60]Do I get to be in a car?
[14:31.95]Oh man, I get to run and shit?
[14:34.47]Nah, okay, we're doing this one.
[14:35.47]I get to drive a car.
[14:36.73]It's 106 miles to Chicago.
[14:38.63]We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes.
[14:41.91]Okay, we're doing this one.
[14:45.21]I don't know these fucking movies.
[14:47.13]I've only seen them like once.
[14:49.48]It's 106 miles to Chicago.
[14:50.82]Okay, here we go.
[14:52.58]I don't know, who am I gonna be?
[14:54.40]Should I be Dan Aykroyd or should it be Jimmy Neutron?
[14:57.12]What was his name?
[14:58.36]John Belushi.
[14:58.86]Alright, let me go follow, wait, wait, wait.
[15:08.39]Position myself, okay.

[15:34.60]That's me running, like... And then I gotta get in the car, right?
[15:37.96]Wait, that's not me running.
[15:40.90]It's 106 miles to Chicago.

[16:42.40]We're ad-libbing this one.
[16:43.78]Nevermind, we're not.
[16:44.52]You have to, like, press square.
[16:45.75]Uh, okay, I'm gonna be... Okay, clear it out.
[16:54.21]Alright.
[16:57.77]I wanna do that again.
[16:58.53]I'm gonna do it right this time.
[16:59.64]I'm gonna come from stage over here.
[17:01.10]I'm not gonna look at the screen.
[17:02.96]I'm putting down the fucking controller.
[17:05.02]I gotta have two fucking hands here, you know what I mean?
[17:07.74]Fuck the lines.
[17:08.82]I'll show you how a real actor does it.
[17:13.19]Here we go.
[17:24.94]Hey, did you get the stuff?
[17:27.00]Of course you did.
[17:28.12]We got to get out of here as quick as fucking possible.
[17:30.24]We stole all those diamonds.
[17:31.54]Grind out loud.
[17:32.04]Let me get on the right side of the wheel.
[17:34.02]Get it!
[17:35.16]God damn it.
[17:37.15]We hit the thing on top.
[17:47.05]Hey, did you get the stuff?
[17:49.05]Of course you did.
[17:50.13]We gotta get out of here as quick as fucking possible.
[17:52.27]We stole all those diamonds, for crying out loud.
[17:54.03]Let me get on the right side of the wheel.
[17:55.13]Get it.
[17:55.75]Get it!
[17:57.05]God damn it.
[17:57.77]Ah, we hit the thing on top.
[18:02.99]Give me one.
[18:12.94]That was a short one.
[18:14.28]We could do the longer stuff.
[18:18.35]We need a longer scene than that.
[18:20.19]What else is part of it?
[18:20.78]Is there anything else in the Blues Brothers?
[18:21.86]I think it's just this one.
[18:26.20]Or he wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[18:28.50]Says he'll water his garden with champagne.
[18:30.28]Oh, this is going to be fucking awful.
[18:31.52]I can't wait for this.
[18:32.34]Or he wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[18:34.62]Says he'll water his garden with champagne before you let the Germans drink it.
[18:38.87]This ought to take the sting out of being occupied.
[18:41.13]Doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
[18:42.53]You said it.
[18:43.91]Here's looking at you, kid.
[18:45.50]Oh, the famous line.
[18:46.87]I mean, we've got to do the famous line, right?
[18:48.51]Okay, I can do it.
[18:50.55]I can do it.
[18:51.09]Let me know.
[18:51.43]Let me know.
[18:51.93]Let me do that one.
[18:52.81]Okay.
[19:23.28]Ori wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[19:25.56]Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.
[19:32.16]Yeah.
[19:33.45]You said it.
[19:34.85]He's looking at you, kid.
[19:39.25]Ori wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[19:41.59]Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.
[19:47.93]Yeah.
[19:49.41]You said it.
[19:50.81]He's looking at you, kid.
[19:53.01]I got 17,000 points.
[19:55.47]Do it again.
[19:56.01]Do it again.
[19:56.63]Do it again.
[19:57.69]Do that one again.
[19:59.91]Do it again.
[20:09.68]Do it again.
[20:10.38]Do it again.
[20:11.00]I want to do that one again.
[20:14.10]Ori wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[20:16.35]He says he'll water his garden with champagne before you let the Germans...
[20:23.61]We're doing that one again.
[20:25.43]Cover your ears, by the way.
[20:30.39]Cover your ears.
[20:31.09]I'm warning you.
[20:38.34]I'm going to scream.
[20:39.44]So I'm warning you guys right now.
[20:41.64]I'm just going to scream.
[20:52.65]Horry wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[20:55.08]Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.
[20:58.90]You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!
[21:02.10]I fucking hate you!
[21:03.54]He's looking at you, kid.
[21:08.70]Horry wants us to finish this bottle and then three more.
[21:11.04]Says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink it.
[21:14.78]You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!
[21:18.28]I fucking hate you!
[21:19.32]Shut it.
[21:20.36]He's looking at you, kid.
[21:23.31]Not funny.
[21:28.30]That one wasn't funny.
[21:29.08]I know, but whatever.
[21:30.86]They can't all be home runs, alright?
[21:33.64]It's Casablanca.
[21:36.10]You can't make Casablanca.
[21:37.06]You can make CSI funny, though.
[21:42.67]Oh, God.
[21:44.23]See the difference between the left shoe print and the right?
[21:46.80]Look at the pressure releases, the positioning.
[21:49.50]Oh, man.
[21:50.14]OK.
[21:50.28]He's got a heart.
[21:50.84]Whoever stood here planted his left foot.
[21:52.53]He put some weight on it.
[21:53.97]And threw something.
[21:54.95]You can read the line of travel like an arrow.
[21:59.87]Where you plant, you point.
[22:02.61]What is that?
[22:05.39]Roast beef.
[22:10.85]That's an alligator.
[22:12.95]We got to do this.
[22:13.75]What are you doing?
[22:15.60]Brian?
[22:15.90]Wait, where's the gun?
[22:17.18]Brian?
[22:17.54]Oh, Brian?
[22:19.06]This is so long.
[22:26.55]Looking for this?
[22:29.07]Took the back door.
[22:30.26]What the fuck?
[22:31.12]You need to memorize this whole entire show.
[22:34.58]OK, fine, let's go.
[22:39.56]I... I have no idea.
[22:41.66]See the difference between the last sh- How are you supposed to do this without knowing?
[22:45.04]Any of this shit?
[22:45.70]No, I'm gonna be here.
[22:52.75]There's so much movement!
[22:54.03]You know how much movement I'm gonna have to do right here?
[22:57.79]Oh my lord.
[23:02.67]I don't know what those lines were.
[23:03.71]I'm gonna look like such a bad actor.
[23:13.97]You see the difference?
[23:15.65]You see the difference between the left shoe print and the right one?
[23:18.08]No, hey!
[23:19.86]You see the difference between these shoe prints here?
[23:21.72]Look at the pressure releases.
[23:23.20]The positioning.
[23:24.62]Whoever stood here planted his foot left and put some weight on it over there.
[23:28.22]And threw something.
[23:28.98]I thought you could see.
[23:30.56]You can read the line of travel like an arrow.
[23:34.12]Where you plant, you point.
[23:35.97]That's true.
[23:36.87]What is that?
[23:40.59]Roast beef.
[23:48.00]What are you doing?
[23:49.84]Brian?
[23:50.00]Hey, put the gun down.
[23:50.74]Put the gun down.
[23:51.34]I'm back here.
[23:51.92]Brian?
[23:53.66]I'm back here.
[23:54.34]Just don't shoot the alligator.
[23:55.38]He's an innocent animal.
[23:58.68]Looking for this.
[24:04.63]He's in the back door.
[24:10.09]You see the difference?
[24:11.80]You see the difference between the left shoe print and the right one?
[24:14.22]No.
[24:14.42]Hey.
[24:15.57]Did you see the difference between these shoe prints here?
[24:17.75]Look at the pressure releases, the positioning.
[24:20.55]Whoever stood here planted his foot left and put some weight on it over there.
[24:24.50]And threw something.
[24:25.26]Right.
[24:26.22]See, you breathe a line of travel like an arrow.
[24:30.38]Where you plant, you point.
[24:31.76]It's true.
[24:33.12]What is that?
[24:36.24]Roast beef.
[24:39.28]What are you doing?
[24:48.22]Brian?
[24:50.30]Brian?
[24:51.02]He's in the back door.
[25:04.01]Oh my god, what a fucking joke.
[25:10.08]Tighter script time, but you have to memorize the whole scene.
[25:17.67]That one was, okay, for like a little jokey family fun game.
[25:21.20]That was like a full two-minute scene.
[25:24.56]What is it?
[25:25.22]I've got bad news.
[25:26.20]Well, spit it out, Dirk.
[25:28.30]Apparently your brother, Glenn Ross, is on his way here.
[25:31.33]He wants to do a quick audit.
[25:32.71]That's fine.
[25:34.03]We're fine, right?
[25:36.51]The only problem is that we just lost Janet on check stand three.
[25:40.11]Her shift is about to begin.
[25:41.70]Where is she?
[25:42.72]Go find her.
[25:43.91]Loss isn't dead, sir.
[25:44.99]She passed away last night.
[25:46.67]So, she's not coming in, then?
[25:49.93]I don't think so, sir.
[25:51.85]Oh, God.
[25:53.61]Okay, I'm gonna do this.
[25:54.17]I'm gonna do the guy in the chair.
[25:55.12]What is it?
[25:55.78]I've got bad news.
[25:56.74]Well, spit it out, Dirk.
[25:58.92]Apparently, Glenn Ross is on his way here.
[26:01.88]He wants to do a quick audit.
[26:03.26]That's fine.
[26:03.86]Here we go.
[26:04.14]Let's be an actor.
[26:09.00]Let's be an actor.
[26:13.36]I got this one in the fucking bank.
[26:24.49]He's over there, right?
[26:27.23]Let's be an actor for once.
[26:35.45]I've got bad news.
[26:36.94]Bad news, huh?
[26:38.22]What is it?
[26:38.54]Apparently your brother, Glen Ross, is on his way here.
[26:41.56]He wants to do a quick audit.
[26:43.33]An audit?
[26:44.37]How did you let that happen?
[26:45.23]How could he have come in here?
[26:46.07]Where's his mother?
[26:46.67]The only problem is that we just lost Janet on check stand three.
[26:50.31]Her shift is about to begin.
[26:53.05]Shit.
[26:54.13]Lost as in dead, sir.
[26:55.21]She passed away last night.
[26:56.53]She's dead.
[26:57.31]She died.
[26:58.51]Why do you boys and I inform about this?
[27:00.15]I don't think so, sir.
[27:01.51]No, you should know that because I'm the boss of this whole place.
[27:04.67]You need to inform me of these things.
[27:06.43]You're fucking fired.
[27:07.79]Pack up your bags and get out of here.
[27:09.61]And take that dog with you.
[27:15.29]I've got bad news.
[27:16.63]Bad news, huh?
[27:17.89]What is it?
[27:18.37]Apparently your brother, Glenn Ross, is on his way here.
[27:21.39]He wants to do a quick audit.
[27:22.93]An audit?
[27:23.91]How did you let that happen?
[27:24.77]How could he have come in here?
[27:25.59]Where's his mother?
[27:26.57]The only problem is that we just lost Janet on check stand three.
[27:30.19]Her shift is about to begin.
[27:32.41]Shit.
[27:33.54]How come?
[27:34.00]Ross isn't dead, sir.
[27:35.08]She passed away last night.
[27:35.96]She's dead?
[27:36.64]She died?
[27:37.82]Well, why wasn't I informed about this?
[27:40.03]I don't think so, sir.
[27:40.99]No, you should know that because I'm the boss of this whole place.
[27:43.87]You need to inform me of these things.
[27:45.61]You're fucking fired.
[27:46.97]Pack up your bags and get out of here.
[27:48.27]And take that dog with you.
[27:51.71]Okay, what the fuck?
[27:52.13]That was the director's cut.
[27:58.00]What is this, a music battery?
[28:00.44]You have no battery?
[28:04.33]I can't even save the game.
[28:06.15]What is it?
[28:06.85]I've got bad news.

[36:35.74]I don't think I know who I'm playing as.
[36:42.12]Oh, goddammit.
[36:42.94]I don't want to be her.
[36:50.88]What did she say?

[37:13.97]It's going to be okay.

[37:35.42]You know how hard it is to fucking look at the screen?
[37:46.95]and just read the shit and make sure I'm not an invisible man.
[37:49.23]Actually, that was actually pretty good.
[37:52.45]I need to stop looking at the camera.
[37:56.31]I have to read the lines and know where we are.
[37:58.52]Here's my hangover.
[38:04.52]This was a hangover.
[38:06.00]Who the hell are you?
[38:06.64]Mike Tyson.
[38:07.34]Quiet, quiet.

[38:12.14]Mike Tyson?
[38:13.00]Oh, yeah.
[38:14.00]I'm doing it.
[38:15.79]I'm going to be calling him Mike Tyson.
[38:19.93]I'm going to ad-lib this, by the way.
[38:21.75]Mike Tyson?
[38:23.19]This is my favorite part coming up right now.
[38:30.76]I definitely ain't singing, so no way.
[38:42.07]Let's do it.
[38:48.34]The setup is the thing that freaks me out the most.
[38:50.69]Okay.
[38:54.93]Sing?
[38:55.23]I have to be like the... Who the hell are you?
[39:00.44]Quiet.

[39:01.46]Quiet.
[39:04.86]Mike Tyson?
[39:07.02]Shut up.
[39:08.04]This is my favorite part of the song.
[39:13.91]I can feel it.
[39:15.07]It's coming in the air tonight.
[39:16.13]It's a fucking it's we're gonna get like two wins three wins.
[39:19.29]They're gonna make a fucking storm I've actually been waiting for all three you guys come.
[39:28.12]Oh, wait.
[39:28.34]Well wrong.
[39:28.76]Wait, hold on.
[39:31.62]I missed.
[39:32.32]Oh, jeez.
[39:33.36]Beats a shit.
[39:35.10]Yo, next.
[39:35.48]Why did you do that?
[39:36.58]God, I fucking felt like it.
[39:38.04]I would like to know why is this tiger in your bathroom?
[39:44.09]Who the hell are you?
[39:45.43]Quiet, quiet down, quiet.
[39:49.98]Mike Tyson?
[39:51.98]Shut up.
[39:52.98]This is my favorite part of the song.
[39:58.26]Yo, I can feel it.
[39:59.84]It's coming in the air tonight.
[40:00.90]It's a fucking, it's a, we're going to get like two winds, three winds.
[40:03.74]They're going to make a fucking storm.
[40:05.52]You know, I'll tell you something.
[40:08.35]I've actually been waiting for all three of you guys.
[40:12.67]Oh, wait, wait, hold on.
[40:16.40]This game is fucking perfect by the way.
[40:17.92]Let's get that one better.
[40:19.16]We're gonna do this one good.
[40:20.34]And I'll show you how we're gonna do it good.
[40:45.08]Who the hell are you?
[40:46.42]Quiet, quiet!
[40:48.44]I'll get this one correct this time.
[40:50.52]Okay.
[41:17.86]Who the hell are you?
[41:23.65]Mike Tyson?
[41:24.43]That's right.
[41:25.19]You got a problem?
[41:26.69]Shut the fuck up.
[41:29.27]Just enjoy the music.
[41:51.52]I told you to enjoy the music.
[41:52.88]Stop fucking singing it.
[41:54.24]Why did you do that?
[41:56.12]Mr. Tyson would like to know why is this tiger in your bathroom?
[42:02.64]Who the hell are you?
[42:08.79]Mike Tyson?
[42:10.87]That's right.
[42:12.65]You got a problem?
[42:24.61]Shut the fuck up.
[42:26.43]Just enjoy the music.
[42:30.16]Don't you enjoy the music.
[42:37.20]Stop fucking singing.
[42:39.38]Why did you do that?
[42:41.26]Mr. Tyson would like to know why is this tiger in your bathroom?
[42:45.11]There you go.
[42:47.45]That was... That was like a fucking frog.
[42:58.56]Watch out for the frog.
[43:03.56]What's next?
[43:06.22]What is this one?
[43:08.15]I'd like to say something.
[43:09.81]Is there another punch?
[43:11.57]Hello.
[43:14.59]How about that ride in?
[43:16.77]I guess that's why they call it Sin City.
[43:19.42]This one's going to be lame if I do it.
[43:21.46]You guys might not know this, but I consider myself a bit of a loner.
[43:26.46]I tend to think of myself as a one-man wolf pack.
[43:29.84]No, no, this is gonna be so... You guys are gonna like... But when my sister brought Doug home, I knew he was one of my own.
[43:33.66]Your assholes are gonna like pucker and you're gonna cringe into oblivion if I do this.
[43:36.32]And my wolf pack, it grew by one.
[43:39.13]No.
[43:39.81]So were there two of us... There were two of us in the wolf pack.
[43:42.89]I was alone first in the pack and then Doug joined in later.
[43:48.06]And six months ago, when Doug introduced me to you guys, I thought... No, that one's way too long and too long with it.
[43:55.90]What about the Italian joke?
[43:57.24]What about this one?
[43:59.49]Are you kidding me?
[44:01.17]Hey, how are you?
[44:02.77]Oh, I'm good.
[44:03.95]I'm good.
[44:04.45]Nice to meet you.
[44:05.23]I'm handsome Rob.
[44:07.21]And you are?
[44:07.85]Oh, my name's Becky, but it's written on my shirt.
[44:11.27]Listen, I'm gonna need your shirt and your truck.
[44:14.38]No, that one's dumb.
[44:15.76]The scene contains language that may be inappropriate for children.
[44:21.36]Okay, so what?
[44:38.04]How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?
[44:40.70]Well, I don't know.
[44:41.36]Probably because it's impossible, dipshit.
[44:44.00]What?
[44:44.34]Putting on a mask and helping people?
[44:45.96]How's that impossible?
[44:47.24]Well, that's not superhero, though.
[44:48.68]How's that super?
[44:49.46]Super's like being stronger than everybody.
[44:51.24]Is it dipshit?
[44:51.62]Flying and shit.
[44:52.22]That's just hero.
[44:53.14]No, it's not even hero.
[44:54.52]It's just psycho.
[44:56.56]Hello, Bruce Wayne?
[44:58.35]You didn't have any powers?
[44:59.61]Yes, but he had all the expensive shit that doesn't exist.
[45:02.19]I thought you meant, like, how come nobody does it in real life?
[45:04.42]Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.
[45:05.64]Dude, if anybody did it in real life, they'd get their ass kicked.
[45:08.49]They'd be dead in, like, a day.
[45:09.53]This is just, like, a little... Okay, I'm not saying they should do it.
[45:12.57]I just can't figure... No, alright.
[45:14.05]We got anything else besides a talkie?
[45:15.79]Oh, no, I'm just standing around, you know.
[45:18.72]No, not... How about that, huh?
[45:25.12]Oh, yeah.
[45:26.70]I don't have anything to do this with.
[45:27.84]I think it's best that you just walk away.
[45:29.76]Well, maybe you shouldn't do that.
[45:31.38]What?
[45:31.60]Huh?
[45:31.92]Are you looking at me?
[45:33.14]Well, this is my business.
[45:35.54]Oh, my fucking God.
[45:38.84]I don't have anything.
[45:39.74]I'm gonna look like a fucking idiot.
[45:41.56]What else is there?
[45:42.66]Alright, I'm gonna make like a tripod for this one.
[45:46.92]Oh, no, I'm just standing around, you know.
[45:49.84]No, not... How about...
[45:55.00]No, man.
[45:55.64]This is not gonna be... This is not gonna... Okay.
[46:01.36]Get your, like... Get your fucking screenshots ready, because I'm about to fucking, like, never live this down for the rest of my life.
[46:07.72]Wait, I gotta get, like, something to swing.
[46:10.38]No, no, no.
[46:10.69]I'm not ready.
[46:11.07]I'm not ready.
[46:11.49]I gotta get something to swing.
[46:12.55]Not ready.
[46:13.81]I'm not ready yet.
[46:14.41]Wait.
[46:14.61]Wait a second.
[46:17.91]Xbox.
[46:19.13]The Xbox One.
[46:21.77]I'm the fucking Xbox One bruiser.
[46:26.65]Oh, no, I'm just standing around, you know.
[46:30.33]Yes!
[46:31.87]Where's the fucking... I'm supposed to be looking in the mirror.
[46:35.51]Oh, yeah, you didn't see... It's supposed to switch around.
[46:38.79]This is a fucking bust.
[46:40.45]This is a bust.
[46:42.21]I'm just standing here, swinging around.
[46:45.65]Like, that's what I'm supposed to be doing without any switches and... It's over.
[46:49.99]Oh, no, I'm just standing around, you know.
[46:53.64]Yes!
[46:55.72]I'm supposed to be looking in the mirror.
[46:58.66]Oh, yeah, you didn't see.
[46:59.52]It's supposed to switch around.
[47:01.88]This is a fucking bust.
[47:03.54]This is a bust.
[47:05.02]I'm supposed to be standing here, swinging around.
[47:08.67]Like, that's what I'm supposed to be doing.
[47:11.21]Okay.
[47:12.31]Well, that was great.
[47:15.63]It didn't do the scene switches that it looked like it was going to do.
[47:17.99]Alright, well, that scene sucks.
[47:25.29]We only got like 60 more to do.
[47:26.89]Oh, no, I'm just standing around, you know.
[47:28.69]I don't want to do that one.
[47:32.09]Kindergarten cop?
[47:34.19]Mad men.
[47:35.09]What's the matter?
[47:38.71]I have a headache.
[47:40.13]It might be a tumor.
[47:41.63]It's not a tumor.
[47:42.93]It's not a tumor at all.
[47:47.70]What I meant was, you tell me, who is your daddy and what does he do?
[47:55.22]That was too short.
[47:57.10]I'll blow that one.
[47:58.40]Madman.
[47:58.72]You're married now.
[48:00.04]I'm a part of that club, too.
[48:01.32]Two very happy years.
[48:03.57]But when I'm out in the world, I don't know.
[48:07.27]I don't do it much.
[48:08.07]I'm not good at it.
[48:08.95]The flirting, the double entendres.
[48:10.99]You mean something on the side?
[48:13.53]No, I mean enjoying the company of women in the limited way a married man can.
[48:19.01]This is too much.
[48:21.05]That's all we have, really.
[48:22.87]I can't speak for everyone, but it's plenty for me.
[48:25.17]Do the hangover one.
[48:26.21]I guess on some level, I always thought Draper was the same way.
[48:29.41]Draper?
[48:30.45]Who knows anything about that guy?
[48:31.67]No one's ever lifted that rock.
[48:33.29]He could be Batman, for all we know.
[48:35.61]Fine, you want me to do this one?
[48:36.43]You want to do kindergarten comp?
[48:37.73]I want to do the meme?
[48:38.83]I have a headache.
[48:41.09]It might be a tumor.
[48:42.59]It's not a tumor.
[48:44.07]Okay, here you go.
[48:44.57]Here you go, kids.
[48:45.97]Here you go.
[48:46.47]Bring in the kids.
[48:48.80]Bring in the fucking kips.
[48:50.64]I'll do the meme from like 1981, whenever the fuck this movie came out.
[48:54.91]Oh, I'm getting like tangled up in my cords and shit.
[49:07.52]I'm not even like in the right, I'm like, this is not gonna work.
[49:10.94]I have to be like sitting, but that's not where I am.
[49:13.78]I'm like way too close.
[49:15.84]An ancient meme.
[49:18.29]Dig this meme up from below the grave and bring it on and put it on my screen.
[49:24.65]What's the matter?
[49:26.27]I have a headache.
[49:27.61]It might be a tumor.
[49:29.07]You little shit, it's not a tumor, okay?
[49:31.77]I'm gonna strangle your parents, okay?
[49:34.05]That's what's gonna happen to them.
[49:35.31]I'm gonna put my hands around their neck and strangle them.
[49:39.99]Tonight's homework is page 25 of... What's the matter?
[49:44.91]I have a headache.
[49:46.49]It might be a tumor.
[49:47.71]You little shit, it's not a tumor, okay?
[49:50.32]I'm going to strangle your parents, okay?
[49:52.58]That's what's going to happen to them.
[49:53.82]I'm going to put my hands around their neck and strangle them.
[49:58.40]Tonight's homework is... That was the classic scene.
[50:10.35]You promised me a meme.
[50:12.99]I'm not going to do the meme.
[50:17.01]I was way too close, by the way.
[50:21.47]Hold on, I wanna try this thing again.
[50:25.74]Try it again.
[50:29.34]I need to be up higher.
[50:30.36]I have a headache.
[50:32.46]It might be a tumor.
[50:33.66]There you go.
[50:40.28]Press it.
[51:03.89]What's the matter?
[51:06.67]I have a headache.
[51:07.05]It might be a tumor.
[51:08.21]Listen, I only did... We're going to start over.
[51:10.11]Hold on a minute.
[51:10.67]Start over.
[51:11.78]Start over, kids.
[51:13.04]I fucked it up.
[51:17.54]Start over.
[51:18.70]Start it over.
[51:19.46]I fucking... I blew it.
[51:22.60]What's the matter?
[51:25.70]I have a headache.
[51:26.16]It might be a tumor.
[51:27.24]Listen, I only did... We're going to start over.
[51:29.08]Hold on a minute.
[51:29.62]Start over.
[51:30.72]Start over, kids.
[51:31.60]Hold on a minute.
[51:46.19]Alright, we're moving on.
[51:47.59]I can't talk.
[51:48.05]It's over.
[51:48.35]It's over for that one.
[51:50.89]God damn it.
[51:51.71]What do we got?
[51:52.77]Meet the Fockers?
[51:55.44]Meet the Parents, too.
[51:56.30]What's on Meet the Fockers?
[52:02.22]Oh, look.
[52:02.88]Look.
[52:03.56]It's an abacus.
[52:06.58]Abacuses aren't that much fun, are they?
[52:08.92]Do I get to be the kid?
[52:09.92]People think they're fun.
[52:11.48]Look at this.
[52:12.56]Look, it's bolts on a plank.
[52:16.15]Fun bolts.
[52:16.69]I hope I get to be the kid.
[52:17.47]No, not very fun.
[52:19.63]Hey.
[52:20.63]A little birdie.
[52:24.11]Look, he sings.
[52:26.33]And if that mockingbird don't sing, then Greg is gonna buy you a diamond ring.
[52:32.74]Too bad.
[52:33.36]And if that diamond ring gets... No, sorry.
[52:43.38]Greg and Bernie Falker.
[52:48.30]Oh, God.
[52:50.90]Hey, Dad.
[52:51.64]It's going good so far, right?
[52:53.26]Dad, you got to take down that weird shrine thing.
[52:56.00]Well, I'm very proud of you, Gaylord.
[52:57.56]What's wrong with showing it?
[52:58.80]It's ridiculous.
[53:00.08]Most people aren't proud of sixth place ribbons.
[53:02.31]Most people?
[53:03.01]Since when do you care about most people?
[53:05.89]I'll come back to this one.
[53:06.65]Meet the parents.
[53:10.25]We'll check out with this one.
[53:11.41]This one's appropriate.
[53:15.67]Hello, Jack.
[53:18.53]Oh, look at that.
[53:19.31]Nice, Jack.
[53:20.23]Hi.
[53:20.47]CIA man, huh?
[53:22.67]They teach you that in the CIA?
[53:24.85]They teach you that?
[53:25.53]What?
[53:26.59]Yeah, you thought Puff was just the name of the boy's magical dragon?
[53:29.79]Uh-huh.
[53:30.81]Not too quick on the uptake, huh, Jack?
[53:32.27]The mummy?
[53:33.09]I won't get to it.
[53:33.63]Big CIA pulse detector.
[53:35.91]Ooh.
[53:36.53]Hey, hey, check my pulse on this question, Jack.
[53:39.37]Do I think you're a psycho?
[53:40.63]Yes.
[53:40.97]Okay, well, maybe.
[53:42.22]Alright, what about the mummy?
[53:44.51]Oh, Christ.
[53:47.93]Wait, I get to be the mummy, too?
[53:49.25]Does it make me look like that?
[53:52.69]OK, yeah, we got to do this one.
[53:56.82]I'm making noise.
[53:57.38]That's even worse somehow.
[54:00.36]I don't have anything like that at home.
[54:11.55]This is going to be... Oh, man.
[54:12.99]I don't know if I like this one.
[54:18.35]Oh, man.
[54:19.35]Oh, man.
[54:20.06]Oh, man.
[54:20.34]This is not going to be good.
[54:22.14]I'm not looking forward to this one.
[54:23.94]This is going to be so awful.
[54:25.32]It's going to be like... This is going to be so cringy.
[54:27.68]I don't even want to do this.
[54:47.20]Hey, I was thinking about changing something with my hair.
[54:51.50]Making it look a little nicer.
[54:55.66]You're not that good looking either.
[54:57.48]Look at my hair.
[55:00.21]Am I balding yet?
[55:01.83]Am I balding?
[55:03.05]I think I am.
[55:04.35]Can you tell?
[55:04.77]That was funny.
[55:12.44]Hold on a second.
[55:13.54]I think there might be a monster somewhere behind us.
[55:16.70]Holy shit, that's what you were talking about the whole time, man.
[55:28.57]That's my hand.
[55:29.51]And there's fucking jewels in it.
[55:33.03]There's all kinds of riches for you.
[55:37.63]Where are the other sacred gems?
[55:39.09]I don't need subtitles.
[55:41.87]Oh, my lord.
[55:42.93]I was thinking about changing something with my hair.
[55:45.47]Making it look a little nicer.
[55:48.81]You think of that?
[55:49.97]That's funny.
[55:50.91]I mean, you're not that good-looking either.
[55:52.93]So, just look.
[55:53.91]Look at my hair.
[55:54.41]Am I balding yet?
[55:55.61]Am I balding?
[55:56.31]I think I am.
[55:59.69]Can you tell?
[56:00.09]That was funny.
[56:02.13]Hold on a second.
[56:03.51]There might be a monster somewhere behind us.
[56:08.25]That's my hand!
[56:25.41]And there's fucking jewels in it.
[56:27.75]There's all kinds of riches for you.
[56:29.97]Dude, where are the other sacred gems?
[56:33.65]I didn't even read subtitles.
[56:36.64]Oh my god, what a fucking disaster.
[56:38.46]Okay, we're gonna do that one, but from the other perspective.
[56:47.64]Okay?
[56:53.16]We're gonna do that one from the other perspective.
[57:00.01]Okay, here we go.
[57:45.01]Please just don't hurt me.
[57:47.03]And what is it?
[57:51.52]Please don't kill me.
[57:53.14]Fucking monster.
[57:54.64]Please don't kill me.
[57:58.12]Did I get you with that acting?
[57:59.22]I did.
[57:59.58]Hey, what's going on, dude?
[58:01.47]Hey, can I see the jewels that you brought here?
[58:02.83]Do you get that sometimes?
[58:05.51]Okay.
[58:06.45]Yeah, you're scary.
[58:07.23]You get that look.
[58:07.77]Yeah, come on.
[58:08.37]Let's see.
[58:09.19]Show me the goods.
[58:10.05]That's why you came down here, man.
[58:15.50]My language?
[58:15.94]You don't like my language?
[58:18.84]That's fine.
[58:19.96]Like, it was going to be 600 bucks.
[58:21.70]Thank you.
[58:23.13]That's not fake shit, is it?
[58:24.37]Better not be.
[58:25.45]You fucking asshole.
[58:26.63]Thousand-year-old prick.
[58:34.04]You'd like to know what they are?
[58:34.98]Whatever.
[58:40.72]Did I get you with that acting?
[58:54.22]I did.

[59:04.93]That's why we came down here.
[59:09.74]My language?
[59:10.56]You don't like my language?
[59:13.52]That's fine.
[59:14.66]Like, it was gonna be 600 bucks.
[59:16.38]Thank you.
[59:17.78]That's not fake shit, is it?
[59:19.02]Better not be.
[59:20.10]You fucking asshole.
[59:21.21]Thousand-year-old prick.
[59:25.35]That sucked.
[59:43.27]Five stars.

[59:47.19]God.
[59:49.51]Okay, that's...
[60:16.22]I don't get to pick who I get to be?
[60:19.30]Okay, I get to be, I actually, okay, hold on.
[60:51.71]I'm not getting prepared.
[60:59.66]Did you move my seat?
[61:01.98]I haven't touched your seat.
[61:03.16]You didn't touch my seat.
[61:04.62]Well, how come when I move a little bit, I get like a little scrunched up on here?
[61:08.75]You didn't touch it, did you?
[61:10.09]Look at this.
[61:10.45]Look at this shit.
[61:10.99]Like, when my titties hit the horn, it makes a loud noise.
[61:13.87]Isn't that funny?
[61:16.89]Did you move my seat?
[61:19.43]I haven't touched your seat.
[61:20.29]You didn't touch my seat.
[61:21.77]Well, how come when I move a little bit, I get, like, a little scrunched up on here?
[61:25.80]You didn't touch it, did you?
[61:27.10]Look at this.
[61:27.48]Look at this shit.
[61:28.02]Like, when my titties hit the horn, it makes a loud... Oh, okay.
[61:42.77]Let's move on from that one.
[61:45.75]is fucking sick.
[61:47.21]Ay-yi-yi.
[61:47.85]You know what's your problem, man?
[61:54.61]It don't work out.
[61:55.61]It's just a fart scene.
[61:56.31]I better be.
[61:56.71]Oh, you fat.
[61:57.37]I'm muscular.
[61:58.21]Oh, he's a little Hercules.
[61:59.77]Oh, Hercules, Hercules, Hercules, Hercules, Hercules.
[62:01.38]You can eat anything you want.
[62:02.24]Go on.
[62:11.86]I feel strong.
[62:12.98]Well, the recent studies have shown that certain people are genetically predisposed to gaining weight.
[62:17.98]Someday in the near future, we might even find a cure.
[62:20.00]All the time you need to study is your ass.
[62:21.94]The classic, like, grandma's peas falling off.
[62:23.86]Your mama got a big ass.
[62:25.32]You do have a big ass.
[62:26.45]Don't tell me your ass is as big in our family.
[62:29.03]So you need to get used to that.
[62:30.49]And I don't care what diet you go on.
[62:32.71]You can sew up your stomach and your asshole, and you're gonna always be back.
[62:35.73]I forgot about that.
[62:36.41]All I'm trying to see is that scientific breakthroughs are occurring all the time.
[62:39.73]God, Eddie Murphy, what a fucking talented person.
[62:42.29]I can't even... You think I'm gonna compete with Eddie Murphy?
[62:44.57]I love my father.
[62:46.53]So naturally, I challenge his murder to a duel.
[62:51.14]I fail.
[62:53.96]Six-Fingered Man lived my life.
[62:57.76]But he gave me this.
[63:01.21]Yeah, this is not the fart scene.
[63:02.43]How old were you?
[63:03.83]I was 11 years old.
[63:06.49]When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fancy.
[63:11.61]Prepare to die.
[63:13.07]So the next time we meet, I will not fail.
[63:18.77]I will go up to the six-fingered man.
[63:20.61]It's a great fucking movie, but I don't know if I want to do that scene.
[63:23.73]Took you long enough to get here.
[63:26.97]Ten years to come to my house.
[63:28.91]Huh?
[63:29.11]What's the matter?
[63:29.53]You don't like my house?
[63:31.28]I might be able to do it.
[63:33.34]That'll stink.
[63:34.32]That'll stink.
[63:36.98]That's right, it stinks!
[63:38.04]Was that just me doing that?
[63:39.38]Was he that bad of an actor?
[63:41.92]What about your pride?
[63:44.20]What about my pride, Nick?
[63:46.26]At least you have pride!
[63:47.66]I feel like that was just me doing that.
[63:48.92]I ain't had no pride, I ain't had nothing.
[63:51.26]Legs are gone, everything is gone, no one's getting nothing.
[63:54.34]Guy comes up, offers me a fight.
[63:55.98]Big deal, wanna fight the fight.

[63:59.59]Okay, we kinda have to do this.
[64:01.19]I'm not-
[64:21.47]The sync is way off.
[64:22.71]Is it really?
[64:23.19]It shouldn't be.
[64:25.45]I guess, you know, it kind of is.
[64:27.01]Now that I think about it.
[64:28.75]It actually is, for some reason, not synced.
[64:33.81]That's a thing in the game, though.
[64:35.45]That's not on my end.
[64:43.02]Wait, it's way off?
[64:45.68]Just with that scene?
[64:50.14]This hand, this hand, that hand.
[65:03.61]Okay.

[65:23.23]Oh, that's right, and my house must stink.
[65:25.71]I didn't ask for any favors from you.
[65:28.17]Don't slum around me.
[65:30.95]Talking about your prime?
[65:32.83]What about my prime, Nicholas?
[65:35.49]At least you had prime.
[65:37.96]I didn't have no prime.
[65:39.59]I didn't have nothing.

[68:09.10]You got a lot going on, kid.
[68:10.54]Well, my last name?

[76:16.74]Hair flip!
[76:17.36]Hair flip!
[76:18.74]I'm an actor.
[76:19.26]I'm a Hollywood actor.
[76:19.96]I gotta do like a hair flip.
[76:26.29]Protect the book.
[76:27.49]Don't let it get took.
[76:28.75]Right, you told to protect your... Arthur Spiderwick.
[76:34.31]So he wrote the book and asked you to protect it.
[76:36.40]I said, Master, we must destroy it.
[76:38.24]He said, we must protect the book.
[76:40.40]Keep it in the circle, safe from the ogre.
[76:43.20]Circle, circle, little circle, little circle, broke the circle.
[76:45.78]So it protects the book to protect the book.
[76:47.92]Safe in the circle, safe in the circle, safe in the circle.
[76:50.20]Safe from who?
[76:51.72]From who, Starwood?
[76:53.66]What?
[76:54.56]I don't see anything.
[76:55.74]What's the book?
[76:59.16]What is that?
[77:00.32]What is that?
[77:00.80]What are they doing to that little boy out there?
[77:03.38]Stop it!
[77:03.94]Whoa, I didn't see this part.
[77:05.66]Because you took the book out there and practically waved in their faces, you little twerp.
[77:10.49]Calm down!
[77:11.69]Go ahead!
[77:12.31]Now look at the mess you've made!
[77:13.97]You... We didn't watch this far.
[77:16.36]What's happening to him?
[77:17.06]The stone!
[77:17.28]The stone!
[77:17.62]Look!
[77:17.76]Throw that stone!
[77:18.58]Somebody!
[77:18.78]Help!
[77:18.98]Help!
[77:19.16]Wow!
[77:22.62]What are they doing with those goblins?
[77:24.66]What the fuck?
[77:28.68]Protect the buck.
[77:29.72]Don't let it get took.
[77:31.18]Right.
[77:31.44]If you try to protect him...
[77:35.21]Arthur Spiderwick.
[77:36.65]So he wrote the book and asked you to protect it.
[77:38.55]I said, Master, we must destroy it.
[77:40.45]He said, we must protect the book, keep it in the circle, safe from the ogre.
[77:45.42]Circle, circle, little circle, little circle, broke the circle.
[77:47.92]So it protects the book to protect the book.
[77:50.16]Safe in the circle, safe in the circle, safe in the circle.
[77:52.60]Safe from who?
[77:53.76]From who, stalwart?
[77:55.60]What?
[77:56.48]His den, I don't see anything.
[77:57.68]What's the book?
[78:01.02]What is that?
[78:02.62]What are they doing to that little boy out there?
[78:05.60]Stop it!
[78:06.28]Goblins are here!
[78:07.48]And all because you took the book out there and practically waved in their faces, you little twerp!
[78:12.18]Hold up!
[78:13.93]Go ahead!
[78:14.53]Look at the mess you've made!
[78:16.83]We didn't watch this, Bob.
[78:17.87]What's happening?
[78:18.41]The stone!
[78:19.39]The stone!
[78:20.25]Look!
[78:20.51]Throw that stone!
[78:23.97]Wow!
[78:24.45]What are they doing to the goblins?
[78:25.95]What the fuck?
[78:43.20]Just commit to one accent?
[78:47.71]Why?
[78:48.07]Wait, so it's delayed?
[78:49.05]It's like the sync is all over the place apparently.
[78:54.87]The audio is only out of sync when it plays it back.
[78:57.09]Yeah, that's weird.
[78:58.13]I don't know why.
[79:05.88]That was alright.
[79:06.62]What about a Star Trek?
[79:09.96]Commander, reading subspace field fluctuations from within the Borg ship.
[79:14.33]Looks like they're regenerating, restoring power.
[79:17.61]They could be capable of warp any minute.
[79:19.89]Is the deflector ready?
[79:21.31]Okay.
[79:22.47]It's ready.
[79:23.27]This is our only chance to destroy them if they get back in the warp.
[79:25.73]Oh, perfect.
[79:26.11]This is going to be engaged.
[79:27.92]We're being held by the Borg.
[79:29.12]He's going to say, engage.
[79:31.20]On screen.
[79:33.67]Oh man, we're gonna watch this whole fucking scene.
[79:37.81]To be able to say engage once.
[79:41.25]I am Locutus of Borg.
[79:45.40]Resistance is futile.
[79:49.14]Your life as it has been is over.
[79:53.89]From this time forward, you will service us.
[80:02.76]No, this one sucks.
[80:06.90]Mr. Worf.
[80:09.70]Fire.
[80:14.92]That one's boring.
[80:15.60]I don't want to do that one.
[80:18.66]So I put a sequence out.
[80:20.08]It's going to be in sync again during the playback.
[80:21.70]So are these.
[80:23.98]What the fuck is going on in here?
[80:25.22]A lot of them are dead.
[80:27.60]A lot of them are alive.
[80:29.74]But they won't be for long.
[80:31.67]I wish I could be in there.
[80:32.95]That's not fair.
[80:33.35]I want to be in there.
[80:35.07]This is just reaction shots.
[80:35.95]Superman is way more important.
[80:37.09]Oh, yes.
[80:37.37]Come on.
[80:38.83]I don't even need to... I don't even care...
[81:01.76]I already know this is gonna be the best one.
[81:08.15]Oh, perfect.
[81:08.53]Let's do it.
[81:09.03]I don't even need to fucking watch it.
[81:10.67]Gonna be Superman.
[81:12.75]Here we go.
[82:08.18]Is everybody alright?
[82:09.00]I hope this experience hasn't put any of you off for flying, statistically speaking, of course.
[82:16.47]Cheer for me.
[82:17.81]I saved you all.
[82:58.66]Is everybody alright?
[83:00.50]Well, this experience hasn't put any of you off of flying, statistically speaking, of course.
[83:06.78]Cheer for me.
[83:08.10]I saved you all.
[83:10.92]Oh, I got overrun.
[83:24.87]Overrun.
[83:31.71]We got overrun by that one.
[83:32.61]I think it was pretty good until the middle finger showed up.
[83:38.35]Oh, my God.
[83:40.71]This still looks so much more... Terminator.
[83:45.49]I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
[83:47.37]I was told that she's here.
[83:48.61]Could I see her, please?
[83:49.37]No.
[83:49.93]Can't see her.
[83:50.44]She's making a statement.
[83:51.90]Where is she?
[83:53.72]Look, it may take a while.
[83:54.60]If you want to wait, there's a bench over there.
[84:02.65]I'll be back.
[84:03.86]Oh God, not one of these.
[84:04.98]No, I'd rather, you know what, I'd rather just be the guy at the desk.
[84:16.54]Okay, yeah, we're gonna be the guy at the desk.
[84:18.30]I don't wanna be the Terminator.
[84:19.60]We're gonna be the guy at the desk.
[84:20.50]Why would I be the Terminator when I can get hit by a car?
[84:30.69]I love when I get, like, caught looking.
[84:33.13]Alright, let me ask you this.
[84:34.59]Okay, so you can hear me talking right now, right?
[84:38.27]Is this synced up with the game?
[84:44.71]Like... It must be somewhere that it's getting caught up in the PlayStation Eye camera.
[84:49.37]I don't know.
[84:50.27]Okay, here we go.
[85:07.55]Come on.

[87:03.18]Doesn't matter.
[87:04.42]I'll get this one perfect.
[87:06.22]Do both and then splice them together?
[87:07.97]How am I gonna do that?

[92:55.82]I couldn't say.
[92:57.80]But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
[93:00.41]Damn it.

[93:15.87]I don't blame you for that.
[93:17.33]But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting to the brains.
[93:19.85]How the fuck is there just one thing to be scared from?
[93:21.55]Look, I won't be any trouble because I don't need to think.
[93:25.63]Do I get to sing the song?

[94:17.18]Yeah, right.
[94:18.22]Derek, please.
[94:19.32]Some male models go left at the end of a runway.
[94:21.54]Others go right.
[94:22.52]You got a lot of gifts, but hanging a Louie just isn't one of them.
[94:25.94]Sit down.
[94:26.68]Alright, I'm going to do this one.
[94:28.81]Hey, you want to hear some great news?

[95:01.73]Ah, shit.

[95:46.68]I just retired.
[95:47.64]But this is Mugatu, Derek.
[95:49.78]Right now this guy is so hot he can take a crap, wrap it in tin foil, and put a fish hook on it, and lure in all the people like Queen Elizabeth and her earrings, for Christ's sake.
[95:59.39]Derek, what do we do when we fall off the horse?
[96:09.77]Huh?
[96:11.05]Well, get back on the horse, you idiot!
[96:13.36]Lose your brain!
[96:14.46]Sorry, Morrie.
[96:15.54]I'm not a gymnast.
[96:18.14]I'm going back home.
[96:19.90]I need to get in touch with my roots, figure out who I am.
[96:23.68]See you around, Morrie.
