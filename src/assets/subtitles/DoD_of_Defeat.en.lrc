[00:05.04]This is what I did.
[00:05.78]This is exactly what I did.
[00:07.24]You are remembering back when you were like 11 and played this game and how much fun you had.
[00:12.40]Right?
[00:12.96]Yes.
[00:14.14]Now you are like in your 20s.
[00:16.82]This game is... You're gonna... Trust me.
[00:18.50]You will see.
[00:19.34]Dude, I don't know.
[00:19.98]I was like 15 when I played Day of Defeat.
[00:22.61]I wasn't like 11.
[00:23.63]There's a big difference.
[00:25.39]There's a big difference!
[00:27.03]Just wait.
[00:28.01]Just wait till you shoot your first gun.
[00:30.01]Okay.
[00:30.61]You ready?
[00:31.11]Round 1.
[00:31.45]Go!
[00:34.52]I love this game.
[00:44.04]That's the old TF classic voice.
[00:47.44]That brings back memories.
[00:54.06]Oh, star quick scoper.
[00:58.24]What are you using?
[00:59.81]Oh, snipey rifle.
[01:01.59]Someone come at me.
[01:03.49]Using a sniper rifle?
[01:04.59]Yeah, I'm on like a spree right here.
[01:06.25]This is a shwick.
[01:07.27]This is a shwicky swag.
[01:09.97]Shut up.
[01:10.97]I'm going to shut you down.
[01:13.05]I just killed like the whole team and you weren't even there.
[01:16.38]Yeah, because I'm being tactical.
[01:18.98]What does that mean?
[01:20.46]I am an enigma.
[01:22.84]I am an enigma.
[01:26.38]I saw you.
[01:27.02]Just pause here for one second.
[01:29.09]Look at my score.
[01:34.22]1 and 21!
[01:35.40]You're the only person I've killed.
[01:41.60]How does that make me feel, though?
[01:43.56]Really, when you think about it.
[01:45.11]Do you, like, enjoy being bad?
[01:50.09]Yes!
[01:51.09]Yes!
[01:52.19]Duke Gamer, screw you!
[01:54.07]Whatever, I'm putting this knife in someone's back.
[01:55.69]It's so guaranteed.
[01:57.23]Billy Mays.
[01:58.05]Billy Mays would guarantee this.
[01:59.46]This knife is going somewhere.
[02:01.76]There's no way.
[02:02.52]It's like so impossible to get behind anybody in this game.
[02:04.66]I already got a guy.
[02:05.40]What are you talking about?
[02:06.04]I just got it.
[02:06.82]What?
[02:08.30]Jerma.
[02:08.86]Stop.
[02:09.18]Jerma, stop.
[02:09.86]Jerma, stop.
[02:10.88]What?
[02:11.84]Oh, so no one will ever be able to get him.
[02:15.96]It's impossible.
[02:17.22]Where did you even come from?
[02:18.66]Like, seriously.
[02:19.99]You ghost.
[02:21.01]I was in banana.
[02:22.41]I turned around.
[02:23.07]Seriously, you just decloaked.
[02:25.79]Because there's absolutely no way that just happened.
[02:29.37]Meep.
[02:30.02]Babe, oh, you're a real- Wait, you know that?
[02:34.50]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:36.62]I'm just turning around to make sure you're not actually behind me!
[02:39.16]Where did you go?
[02:39.80]Where did you go?
[02:40.40]Are you dead?
[02:41.40]You killed me!
[02:42.32]Oh, it didn't- Oh, yeah, okay, it is in the kill feed.
[02:44.46]It was, like, covered up.
[02:45.50]You're dead.
[02:46.38]Yeah.
[02:47.23]What?
[02:49.07]Oh, I need you to look at this.
[02:50.97]I need to see what this looks like.
[02:52.11]Hey, where are you?
[02:53.55]I'm the one holding the shovel.
[02:54.51]Okay, I'll hold the knife.
[02:57.37]Actually, no, I'm gonna kill your whole team and not shoot the guy with the shovel.
[03:00.34]Alright, I'm just going to wait until they're all dead.
[03:06.21]There's two down.

[03:52.61]Right across the bags.
[03:56.75]Nice.
[03:57.71]Oh my god!
[03:59.09]Got him!
[04:00.29]Alright, I'm reloading.
[04:01.35]What, there's someone behind?
[04:02.03]What?
[04:03.47]Where did he get shot by?
[04:04.95]The guy in front of you.
[04:06.19]I have no idea.
[04:06.88]He just died.
[04:08.04]Oh, he's behind us!
[04:08.56]He's in the window!
[04:09.66]He's in the window!
[04:12.19]He's inside of the window behind us, like, right behind where I was.
[04:15.01]I got him.
[04:17.01]I knew he was behind us, but, like, ah.
[04:19.15]I didn't even know you could, like, go in that building.
[04:21.25]Well, you learn something new about Dodd every day that you play it.
[04:24.22]Yeah.
[04:24.68]Since 1991.
[04:25.26]The last time I played this game was, like, when I was, like, 14.
[04:29.26]I would recommend growing up real quick!
[04:34.02]Alright, I got the bipod set.
[04:37.55]Covering fire.
[04:41.53]Okay, I'm running forward.
[04:42.33]I'm running forward.
[04:42.89]Cover me.
[04:44.09]Covering.
[04:45.93]You had one job!
[04:48.17]You had one job, Jirba!
[04:49.97]That guy just killed everyone.
[04:52.25]That guy might be hacking.
[04:53.43]No, he's not.
[04:54.05]He's not.
[04:54.83]No.
[04:55.49]No, he's not.
[04:56.11]You're just really bad.
[04:57.57]Hey, look at my, like, T-Rex arm.
[05:01.81]I have a little toy gun.
[05:04.85]I don't even have it, like, unlocked.
[05:07.33]Are we really on orange, like, TF2 orange?
[05:10.65]Yes!
[05:11.67]It's so tiny!
[05:13.67]This is so small, dude.
[05:15.31]Oh, my.
[05:16.01]Every single person's up on this thing.
[05:17.60]Just take out your shovel.
[05:24.26]I got your buddy, too!
[05:27.72]I didn't think I was gonna instantly die by falling off that thing.
[05:30.97]That's why you gotta use the parachute, man.
[05:33.21]How do you activate it?
[05:33.99]ARGH!
[05:37.05]How do you activate the shoot?
[05:38.89]You ready to get dotted?
[05:40.39]I already got dotted.
[05:41.61]Do you want to get even more dotted?
[05:44.75]I just got destroyed.
[05:47.23]Oh, this is a point-and-click adventure right here.
[05:49.71]If I ever done seen a point-and-clicker.
[05:54.71]You should... That guy should have died.
[05:56.91]You know those games where, like, they put you in a... You know every modern FPS where they put you in, like, a helicopter and you gotta shoot the minigun at, like, the point-and-click?
[06:05.67]Mm-hmm.
[06:06.92]That's me right now.
[06:12.98]Hi.
[06:14.48]You were just grabbing your balls!
[06:16.77]You were like wiping sweat off your whole face, so don't tell me nothing about my balls.
[06:21.00]It's war.
[06:21.22]You just grabbed your crotch.
