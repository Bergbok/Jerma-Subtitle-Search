[04:48.65]I knew I was gonna fall.
[04:49.40]There's no way I could have made it past that.
[04:52.56]Because the delay is long enough where it doesn't matter what I say.

[05:55.41]New paragraph.
[05:56.05]Comma.
[05:57.00]I'm writing you this email to make sure you know that I tried to make a fun video.
[06:02.72]Unfortunately, comma, unfortunately, that didn't turn out so well.
[06:08.25]My hypothesis and my experimentations were not happening as well as I planned.
[06:13.47]And I'm really sorry it'll never happen again, Tom.
[06:16.11]Please don't fire me.
[06:17.70]I hope we can still be best friends.
