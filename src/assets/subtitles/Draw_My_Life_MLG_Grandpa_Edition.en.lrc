[00:09.15]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11.49]It's Grandpa here.
[00:13.09]You haven't seen me in a while, but you know what?
[00:15.37]Fuck you.
[00:16.27]We're gonna do something today that I've been seeing on the internet for a while, and it's draw my thing.
[00:22.12]No, it's my life.
[00:23.66]Draw my life.
[00:24.44]It's where you draw a picture.
[00:25.54]Just...
[00:26.59]So you draw pictures of your life from when you were a baby and you tell a story about how you were born and stuff.
[00:34.39]And I figured that you would want to know this because I'm the most important person in your life.
[00:39.01]So here we go.
[00:39.83]Ahem.
[00:42.23]So the story of my life goes like this.
[00:45.65]I was born Hilfred J. Steelhelm, the strongest baby on Earth.
[00:52.62]And that's because Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all had sex with each other, and I was the resulting baby.
[01:00.82]Get mad.
[01:02.00]Get jealous, bro.
[01:03.94]It was a tough life being a Super Baby sidekick, going on adventures, saving lives, and dealing with the press.
[01:12.55]But I loved it.
[01:14.23]We were all such a happy family, until one day, my parents died on a rollercoaster ride.
[01:21.60]And I died too.
[01:23.42]I forgot that part.
[01:24.71]And in heaven, God told me I had a bigger purpose.
[01:28.37]He said, I'm going to give you mortality and send you back to Earth to solve the world's problems.
[01:36.24]And I said, okay, send me back, Roger that.
[01:40.72]And I arrived in a basket at the Denver School for Baby Ninja Frog People.
[01:46.86]And I befriended the frogs.
[01:49.38]And they said, thank you.
[01:51.01]And I said, except for one frog named Timmy.
[01:54.03]He used to make fun of me.
[01:55.57]I killed him.
[01:56.85]He's dead.
[01:58.03]He's been dead for 70 years.
[01:59.51]Holy shit, has it really been that long?
[02:01.05]Hold on, let me look at my calendar here.
[02:03.53]Okay, there's, there's Jerma's birth.
[02:06.52]There's, uh, my birthday.
[02:08.78]Wow, really, it's been like 82 years since I killed Timmy.
[02:12.56]Hope his parents aren't that mad at me.
[02:14.22]Whatever, let's get back into this.
[02:16.00]So, I got a job selling old shoes, or, I don't know, you can put whatever you want here, because I didn't have a job for the last, like, probably 40 years.
[02:25.76]I got a job at a fishing dock.
[02:27.88]I was the guy that peeled all the fish's scales off.
[02:30.87]I used to eat them.
[02:31.57]It might be weird to a lot of you guys, but do you think I give a fuck?
[02:35.41]And then came my adult life.
[02:42.19]You've never seen quite an action-packed adventure like this one.
[02:47.52]Gather your friends and explore the wonderful land of Azeroth.
[02:53.49]I actually don't remember half of my adult life, so I just read the back of the Warcraft box.
[02:59.65]So my death was on June 24th, 2002.
[03:05.06]I fell out of an airplane and insta-died on the concrete.
[03:09.88]Made my way back into heaven, and here's a funny story, guys.
[03:12.96]I was in Moses' science class, and guess who sits behind me but God himself.
[03:18.22]I walked up to him after class at his locker, and I just simply asked him, God, you know, could I have like five more years on Earth?
[03:24.98]And I had to trade my fucking Lunchables for it, but I'm here, and it's... Wait a second.
[03:31.99]2002, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[03:34.87]I should've... I should be... I should've died in 2007!
[03:40.22]What the fuck is going on?
[03:40.96]Hold on, wait a minute.
[03:41.82]Is it 2007 right now?
[03:42.48]Jeremy!
[03:42.90]Jeremy, come down here for a second.
[03:47.58]What?
[03:47.68]What do you want?
[03:48.26]What's the year today?
[03:48.84]2005?
[03:48.88]It's 2013, Grandpa.
[03:52.07]2013?
[03:52.09]Jesus.
[03:52.23]I'm supposed to be dead.
[03:52.85]Dead?
[03:52.97]What?
[03:53.11]Oh, hold on a minute.
[04:05.92]Call your mother.
[04:06.62]Call your mother.
[04:07.82]She's the fucking warlock that set all this up.
