[00:07.24]Let's ditch him.
[00:12.46]Those are some big tires you've got there, Jerma.
[00:15.91]They're better to see you with.
[00:19.41]They're better to eat you with, my dear.
[00:24.45]Yes, those are, yep, those are all solid objects.
[00:26.87]Okay, that is two.
[00:27.95]Alright, this is where I wanted to go.
[00:29.03]I wanted to get on this, because I'm going to turn around.
[00:31.81]We're going to get some big air.
[00:36.14]Alright, what's the proper way to change weapons while inside of a vehicle?
[00:43.17]Mouse... no, that's not going to do it.
[00:46.43]It's mouse scroll outside of the vehicle.
[00:48.81]Not sure what it is inside though.
[00:50.21]Whoa!
[00:50.93]That cop was flying.
[00:51.87]Here we go.
[00:52.67]Inside the vehicle it is change radio stations.

[00:57.73]Let's try and catch some air over this little leap.
[01:00.55]Oh, we didn't get in the air.
[01:03.06]That was the leap back there.
[01:04.90]Oh, I thought it was the leap, but I guess not.
[01:07.91]I guess not, huh?
[01:11.83]I gotta switch to the driver's seat.
[01:14.19]Okay, maybe not.
[01:20.57]I probably would have been better off just sitting in the vehicle.
[01:40.33]I just spawned and you like flew by the screen.
[01:50.01]Why did I spawn at the perfect time?
[01:51.81]That was awesome.
[01:54.37]Oh, how surreal.
[01:56.43]I flew you out of the car.
[02:10.95]I picked up something that looks remotely like satchel charges and I clicked the button right as you ran into me so I can only assume that I successfully planted C4 on your vehicle you smacked your face on the car

[03:54.19]Like, my character flew through the window, safely, on top of the building.
[03:58.61]That was incredible.
[04:00.13]Can I still fly this thing?
[04:01.79]This thing's still able to be flown?
[04:04.20]My character's trying to find a way.
