[00:07.12]Are you trying to shoot me?
[00:14.65]Kinda, I don't know.
[00:16.81]You look like you're about to be, like, painted.
[00:19.05]It seriously looks like you're about to be painted by, like, an artist.
[00:25.52]Like, pose right there for me, that's beautiful, yes.
[00:30.08]I like how, like, I'm not even, like, breathing or moving.
[00:35.51]I'm like a statue.
[00:36.55]You really are a statue.
[00:45.52]Just stay like that the whole time.
[00:51.62]Alright.
[00:53.78]I'm just like delivering my statue to like the art museum.

[01:09.87]Alrighty then.
[01:11.37]My car right now looks like... You know when your dog gets into one of your toys and absolutely ruins it?
[01:18.95]Yeah.
[01:19.57]It really looks like a dog chewed up this car.
[01:22.43]It's like this is the most messed up car I've ever driven in.
[01:27.59]Everything is exposed.
[01:28.61]What?
[01:30.08]I'm at the airport right now.
[01:31.98]Let me guess, that's you in that right now.

[02:26.75]That thing is going to kill a lot of people.
[02:29.47]I feel bad for whoever that lands on.
[02:32.13]Oh my god, I want you to go down.
[02:34.29]Oh god, it's so scary!
[02:36.21]Who's it going to land on?

[05:27.31]Oh, jeez, Des!
[05:31.15]No!
[05:32.53]I looked away from my screen temporarily.
[05:34.23]I looked back up and I just see this toppling helicopter going instantly downwards.
[05:38.81]Is that a cop right there?
[06:03.51]Never there for the good stuff.
[06:09.16]Why did I do that?
[06:10.42]I spawned all the way back.

[06:13.74]What did you do?
[06:15.70]Oh, my head.
[06:16.16]I have an instant headache.
[06:18.16]I have an instant headache.
[06:40.13]You guys are behind me.
[06:42.11]Are you guys on the highway behind me?
[06:43.75]Where are you guys?
[06:47.81]You guys are literally within 10 feet of me.
[06:51.01]Where are you guys?
[06:59.05]How did you get that?
[07:00.49]How did you time that so perfectly?
[07:05.18]After I hit you, I did a 360 and just kept driving at the same speed.
[07:08.99]No, how did you even hit me?
[07:10.07]That was like unbelievable that you actually connected with me.
[07:13.66]I walked out in the middle of the highway.
[07:14.76]I was like, where are you guys, Jeb?
[07:16.50]And you just ran into me.
