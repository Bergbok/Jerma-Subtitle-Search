[00:01.09]If I can get to it, that would be great.
[00:08.82]That was my time at Portia.
[00:11.88]And it was pretty fun.
[00:13.28]It was actually really fun.
[00:14.12]This game's a chill game.
[00:14.84]We're not going to play it for too long.
[00:28.37]But it's supposed to be a chill game.
[00:29.39]We'll find out, right?
[00:33.58]What?
[00:34.62]I can just decline it?
[01:06.62]What?
[01:06.86]Okay, I didn't think that was gonna- I thought it was gonna close the game.
[01:13.11]Alright, click and drag left mouse button to move the camera.
[01:17.39]W, A, S, D. Alright.
[01:20.32]Drag the right mouse button to rotate the camera.
[01:23.66]Okay, or Q and E. Okay, makes sense.
[01:26.94]While hovering over the background with your mouse, scroll the wheel to zoom.
[01:29.88]Oh, dude, there's a zoom.
[01:33.23]In Dorf Romantic, you build landscapes out of hexagonal tiles.
[01:38.41]Click on one of the empty tile slots around you with the left mouse button to place your tile.
[01:50.41]Oh, so I can... I get it.
[01:52.45]You can form groups of elements like forests or villages, place tiles next to each other, and connect their colored edges to form a forest spanning at least five tiles.
[01:59.78]Oh!
[02:21.38]There it is.
[02:21.78]Alright, cool.
[02:23.34]The tile count on the bottom right shows you the amount of tiles in your stack.
[02:26.71]Once it reaches zero, the session ends.
[02:28.45]Place three tiles to continue.
[02:38.64]You gain tiles by fulfilling quests.
[02:40.44]This place looks like a fucking awful.
[02:43.90]Indicated by the speech bubbles, to complete this quest, add at least six additional houses to the colored edges.
[03:04.95]Connect exactly two fields to the quest tile.
[03:08.31]The symbol in the corner of the speech bubble hints to a follow-up task.
[03:15.72]Connect exactly two fields.
[03:23.20]What's a field look like?
[03:33.05]What do you mean by field?
[03:33.79]I don't know what it means by field.
[03:35.81]Like an open space?
[03:38.40]Connect two fields to the quest tile.
[03:41.96]Okay.
[03:43.90]Um, but how do I do that?
[03:49.80]Fee- What does it mean by fields?
[03:52.53]Oh, fee- Okay, I thought- Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[03:55.87]I thought that field was a different tile type.
[03:58.11]I didn't know that field was this yellow shit.
[04:01.64]I'm thinking of, like, a green field.
[04:05.86]Alright, so let's go.
[04:11.54]Okay.
[04:19.14]How is that wrong?
[04:24.28]I don't get it.
[04:29.38]There can only be two fields on it?
[04:33.23]I have no idea what the fuck just happened.
[04:35.09]Exactly two, alright.
[04:40.97]Okay, I'll get it, just wait.
[04:44.43]Okay, a flag just spawned.
[04:47.61]Which indicates its group can be closed to gain extra points and tiles.
[04:52.48]This field group is closed when it cannot be expanded anymore.
[04:56.42]Hover over a flag to hide the remaining open edges and place the tiles there.
[05:00.56]So close the edges here.
[05:09.05]So just go around it and close it.
[05:12.81]Does it matter what I use?
[05:18.78]Or just close this out.
[05:32.80]Did I do it?
[05:43.29]What's happening?
[05:44.52]Oh, I made way- Oh.
[05:46.26]I made way too many.
[05:51.24]Okay, I get it.
[05:55.00]I made way too many- Mobile game ad!
[06:00.59]I just made way too many- I didn't- Okay, listen.
[06:03.47]I did not know that a field was that- What the fuck is that?! !
[06:09.36]I didn't know that that's what they meant by field, okay?
[06:12.36]That looks to me like... like a haystack, okay?
[06:25.40]I thought it was like a haystack.
[06:34.33]Train tracks and river tiles have placement restrictions.
[06:38.41]Their ends cannot lead into different types of tiles.
[06:42.30]Okay.
[06:44.56]So we'll put some train tracks on.
[07:12.81]I feel like somebody hit me in the head with a hammer before I started this.
[07:18.72]I just got dinged in the back of the head with a frying pan before I turned this on.
[07:23.50]Okay, alright.
[07:24.20]I just need to start over.
[07:28.71]Collect 100 points.
[07:29.09]You got it.
[07:42.73]Oh, fuck off.
[07:51.83]Okay.
[07:54.87]If all six edges of a tile match its neighbors, it counts as a perfect placement.
[07:58.71]Ooh!
[08:05.30]Let's go!
[08:05.78]To be honest, you don't like this?
[08:07.74]No, I actually really do like this.
[08:09.42]Quiet.
[08:10.38]Alright, let's go.
[08:10.96]This is where we start.
[08:12.73]Everybody relax.
[08:13.83]I've had my two donuts.
[08:18.81]Let's do it.
[08:23.32]I want to have the village be this way.
[08:33.39]And the fields can be over here.
[08:39.37]Yeah, a nice big village town here.
[08:49.39]I don't like that.
[08:51.25]Maybe one over here?
[08:51.89]Ah, I don't like that.
[08:55.09]It's alright.
[09:05.70]That's not terrible.
[09:10.32]That's kind of near the trees.
[09:11.30]Pog.
[09:12.40]Pog.
[09:39.05]Alright, we got a river here.
[09:42.97]Oh, yes!
[09:43.77]The river's gonna go right through town.
[10:03.43]Is this gonna work here?
[10:04.69]Kind of.
[10:05.23]Not really, though.
[10:07.59]I'll make a little small town over here.
[10:23.58]Shit.
[10:25.78]That's alright.
[10:31.41]That's okay.
[10:31.87]That's fine.
[10:35.39]Hey, wake up!
[10:36.19]Wake up.
[10:36.75]Wake up.
[10:46.08]Water tile coming in.
[10:47.18]Windmill.
[10:47.64]Alright.
[11:16.84]Not bad.
[11:20.36]Not bad.
[11:20.70]Alright, I'm gonna put that one in here.
[11:24.09]What?
[11:41.84]Oh, perfect.
[11:42.46]Look at this placement here.
[11:59.22]Check that out.
[12:01.68]This is cute.
[12:03.46]This is cute.
[12:07.08]Good placement there.
[12:07.82]Little lake.
[12:12.04]Little lake that goes over here.
[12:14.12]Cute.
[12:25.51]Ignore them?
[12:26.05]Oh, I'm ignoring them.
[12:26.97]They're being hard ignored.
[12:29.42]Oh, wait.
[12:29.68]Okay, we need to finish this up.
[12:40.39]Can I connect them all?
[12:43.13]I can.
[12:47.07]That connects everybody, right?
[12:50.91]This is beautiful.
[12:52.43]This game is really cool.
[12:55.80]Perfect placement there.
[13:03.70]That's it?
[13:04.14]Right for the flag?
[13:06.91]What's missing?
[13:09.19]Right there.
[13:17.07]Quest fulfilled.
[13:22.24]How much further do I have to go?
[13:23.24]Uh-uh.
[13:30.54]It doesn't like that.
[13:39.71]I don't know if I can do much with the train track shit here.
[13:42.61]Oh yeah, I can.
[13:43.31]Look at that.
[13:43.69]Um... I'm in trouble here, but it's fine.
[13:56.10]Can I put this anywhere?
[13:58.50]Shit.
[13:59.42]I think I screwed it up.
[14:03.72]It's okay.
[14:04.58]It can be right here.
[14:06.20]It's not going to be pretty, but it'll be fine.
[14:08.43]It's good enough.
[14:31.56]Yeah, this single house over here.
[14:32.56]I gotta connect it.
[14:40.94]This one person's surrounded by water?
[14:42.85]It's alright.
[14:53.05]Another windmill.
[14:56.14]I wish I could put it right there.
[14:58.68]Put it here.
[15:18.91]That works?
[15:22.81]Uh-oh.
[15:33.31]Where should I put this one?
[15:36.47]That's not fast.
[15:36.95]I'm gonna give it, like, a cabin over here.
[15:57.82]I'm still going.
[15:58.58]This is still just rolling.
[16:07.07]It looks kind of like shit over here though.
[16:28.86]Um, that's gonna go up this way, I think.
[16:31.24]Yep.
[16:46.95]I did it!
[17:06.31]I'm just... I'm rolling here.
[17:07.25]This is... Zoom out?
[17:10.29]I'm okay with... I gotta stay zoomed in.
[17:18.66]I think I'm screwing it up, though, over here.
[17:29.53]This fucking train... There's a goal?
[17:32.23]Oh!
[17:36.23]Well, let's head that way.
[18:07.66]I did it!
[18:09.38]Wait.
[18:11.70]Was I not supposed to... Oh, I was just trying to get to the tile.
[18:20.69]Oops.
[18:31.35]I fucked it up.
[18:33.33]For the goal in the top right.
[18:38.16]Form a body of water with at least 15 water segments.
[18:42.30]This is getting there.
[18:44.26]Place down 100 tiles in total, okay.
[18:48.02]Finish five sessions with a score of at least 5,000.
[18:57.09]I thought that was going to be the end of the level or something.
[19:00.15]That's why I did all that.
[19:02.75]I think it's eligible.
[19:04.01]It's eligible.
[19:04.51]It's fine.
[19:14.23]Where's this last segment?
[19:19.85]Highlighted edges where... Right here?
[19:23.25]Shit!
[19:45.99]It'll end if you have ti- oh.
[20:08.28]Alright.
[20:08.62]We're good.
[20:13.37]I'm fine.
[20:18.60]Yeah, this is my first time playing.
[20:20.20]I get it, but I don't get it.
[20:21.96]I'll get it eventually.
[20:23.96]Oh, fuck.
[20:24.70]Uh-oh.
[20:25.94]No, I'm alright.
[20:31.52]I have to close these edges.
[20:38.83]Like, close it.
[20:44.63]I wish the highlight was a little more strong.
[20:46.31]I can't even see what I'm looking at.
[20:50.87]Where's this highlighting?
[21:00.05]Can you see anything?
[21:01.01]Oh, it's right there.
[21:02.23]It's hard to see that.
[21:02.94]There we go.
[21:11.90]That fucked up.
[21:12.54]This is all fucked up.
[21:14.16]I think I understand it, though.
[21:19.08]I'm probably going to have to turn the stream off soon.
[21:22.29]I think I'm evolving.
[21:23.23]I can't place this here.
[21:47.74]Oh, for those of you that have no idea what I'm talking about, Holly has COVID, and I probably do too.
[21:54.43]So I've been testing negative the last two days or so, a little more than that.
[22:01.25]And I took a PCR yesterday, so I'm kind of possibly about to be in it.
[22:11.26]But I feel like she's got a mild case.
[22:14.60]I feel fine.
[22:15.08]I'm fine.
[22:15.38]Don't worry.
[22:15.86]I'll be good.
[22:21.21]I almost have the water one done.
[22:24.55]Biome lavender?
[22:27.86]So does this just keep going until I place all the tiles?
[22:34.04]See, I screwed it all up.
[22:35.38]I was fine here, but then when I was like, oh, that's the goal.
[22:38.14]I just have to get to the goal.
[22:39.16]I thought it was going to end the level.
[22:42.02]That's my own fault.
[22:42.72]That's fine.
[22:43.04]I don't know where I can put this now.
[22:50.74]Must be over here.
[22:58.85]Okay, I got a boat.
[23:02.69]Cool.
[23:21.79]I have to close this?
[23:29.08]The level ends when I get 100 points.
[23:38.23]I need water.
[23:40.37]That actually might do it right there.
[23:52.25]Shit.
[23:54.92]Damn it.
[23:55.98]Not quite.
[23:58.00]That doesn't close that out?
[23:59.06]I need houses.
[24:00.78]Ah, whatever.
[24:01.18]I don't care.
[24:03.74]I need to end that anyways.
[24:04.68]Did I do the quest?
[24:21.11]What's the music?
[24:22.07]Uh, yeah, it's whatever the same music is.
[24:23.65]You can come out that way, that's fine.
[24:34.08]Alright, 38 more tiles.
[25:04.34]No.
[25:05.88]It's alright.
[25:08.26]That's okay.
[25:14.14]I don't know where the hell this is supposed to be going.
[25:15.84]I'm just trying to get the achievement.
[25:43.22]I have to connect this or stop it or something.
[25:46.60]I just keep making it bigger.
[26:20.02]Ah.
[26:23.74]Oh, come on.
[26:27.39]What happened here?
[26:31.77]Drain.
[26:38.81]Nothing says one million followers like a crisp Cuban cigar.
[26:47.44]I love that comment.
[26:48.30]That's funny.
[26:56.62]Crisp Cuban cigar.
[27:16.45]Try to complete this over here if I can.
[27:25.83]Screw that up.
[27:26.61]Wait, I can close this now.
[27:32.54]This is like a little kid's train.
[27:34.66]There's a little park here.
[27:35.54]There's a carousel, there's a little train that goes in a circle.
[27:39.56]And then there's... Like a petting zoo and stuff.
[27:44.32]That's not a real train track.
[27:46.12]That's fine.
[28:02.55]At exactly two houses.
[28:04.77]At at least 42 houses.
[28:06.52]Dude, how am I supposed to do that?
[28:31.70]Does that not count?
[28:32.70]That's not... Ah, it's three.
[28:36.00]Shit!
[28:37.70]There's two right here.
[28:44.91]No!
[28:46.43]Yes!
[28:56.77]Yes!
[29:09.23]Perfect, hell yeah.
[29:31.88]Oh, fuck it, I can't.
[29:32.96]This is a map of Disney World.
[29:39.41]Did I lose?
[29:41.19]Oh, it's just a session.
[29:43.02]Okay.
[29:45.74]That's fun.
[29:46.44]That's actually pretty cool.
[29:50.96]I'm only 251,000 in the world.
[29:52.26]Alright, that's it.
[29:56.68]I should probably go.
[29:59.20]That was Dwarf Mantic.
[30:00.96]I might actually play this off stream and just hang out.
[30:02.38]That's actually really cool.
