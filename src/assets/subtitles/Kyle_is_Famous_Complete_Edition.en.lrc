[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.24]You know what else I want to do?
[00:05.65]Hi, sorry if I startled you.
[00:10.79]The whole wrestling... Hey, what song is this thing?
[00:14.47]Does anybody know?
[00:15.19]Remember when we did that video game sound effect thing?
[00:18.25]Where I had to figure out what game it was from?
[00:22.48]Or what character did it?
[00:25.08]Oh, here's a sound effect.
[00:26.12]And what is that?
[00:27.66]What's that from?
[00:29.10]Are there more of those?
[00:32.62]I want to do one of those.
[00:34.66]Is there a good one?
[00:42.80]There are a few more of those.
[00:46.12]If any of you guys know any, or mods, if you can get me a good one.
[00:50.37]One that I haven't done.
[00:54.55]That would be fun to do.
[01:04.10]It's Sporkle?
[01:05.08]Yeah, it would have to be something that can play sound effects through the browser.
[01:14.61]What's... What's Sporkle?
[01:17.09]Let me look this up.
[01:23.18]Sporkle?
[01:29.82]It's just a trivia site.
[01:32.64]No, I don't want to do trivia.
[01:33.50]I want to do sound effects, then I have to guess what the sound is.
[01:43.14]Okay.
[01:45.28]It looks like Kyle is famous as one.
[01:48.00]So I'm going to open it.
[01:50.26]Give some time to maybe get a couple of these fun websites.
[01:57.81]This game is loud.
[02:08.70]Alright, play.
[02:20.46]What you're describing is... No, but it's not trivia, though.
[02:26.19]Trivia would be... This plumber, back in 1985 or 1983, got his start jumping on Goombas.
[02:33.59]Oh, okay, I know what that is.
[02:35.05]Let me see what that is.
[02:41.64]Search it up on Sporkle, you piece of shit.
[02:49.69]Sporkle is based and pog.
[02:51.65]Alright, hold on.
[02:53.33]Do they have what I'm describing?
[02:55.83]Hold on.
[02:56.61]I want to find the one I want to find.
[03:04.50]Hold on.
[03:10.16]They do?
[03:13.58]They have that.
[03:14.28]Alright, okay, okay, okay.
[03:21.80]Sporkle is cracked.
[03:25.36]Do I need an account?
[03:31.43]Wait, what?
[03:33.45]Is this for real?
[03:40.97]Okay, hold on a second.
[03:50.32]I have to turn off ad blocker.
[03:52.92]Okay.
[04:00.18]This is like... Hold on.
[04:06.09]I guess it is?
[04:07.63]Play quiz?
[04:09.05]Hold on.
[04:17.30]Hurdle?
[04:17.86]You should do hurdle.
[04:22.70]Alright.
[04:23.32]Here's what we're gonna do.
[04:25.66]I'm gonna play Kyle is Famous.
[04:27.22]This stream's gonna be not two hours long, guys.
[04:29.36]We'll get a couple of good ones.
[04:31.52]But I gotta do something.
[04:33.66]We'll curate a few.
[04:35.38]Alright, I'm back.
[04:45.75]I need to capture this.
[04:58.46]There it is.
[05:00.52]Okay.
[05:03.70]So this is a choose-your-own-adventure game where you have to make decisions.
[05:06.52]You have to make choices.
[05:09.38]I said I was going to fix the camera, but I didn't.
[05:12.83]Okay.
[05:14.21]Here we go.
[05:21.38]Somebody said they went to McDonald's, they enjoyed the double cheeseburger and the four-piece nuggets that they ordered.
[05:25.75]So I thought I would follow Germa's advice and offer my thanks to the chef.
[05:28.87]The lady at the register just stared at me like I had two heads.
[05:32.29]Oh, come on.
[05:33.53]This is voice acted.
[05:35.15]Okay.
[05:39.81]Sure.
[05:40.87]Tell me if it's too loud.
[05:41.56]Okay.
[05:53.20]What are my choices?
[05:53.90]Okay.
[05:55.02]Alright.
[05:55.20]Cool.
[06:12.51]Top Tech noted that Kyle is inspiring youth to explore STEM fields.
[06:17.09]Is this AI?
[06:18.35]Is this randomly generated?
[06:20.17]Most other talk shows are dedicated to discussing Kyle and his personal details.
[06:25.33]This has to be randomly generated, right?
[06:29.07]Most online videos are best of clips taken from Kyle's latest broadcast.
[06:34.45]Okay.
[06:36.53]The eye of the world is upon Kyle.
[06:41.29]Okay.
[06:41.39]Alright.
[06:41.63]Oh, I have to click on this?
[06:42.74]No, I don't.
[06:43.16]Okay.
[06:43.34]Wait, what did I miss?
[07:10.24]No, no, no, we're good.
[07:10.76]Okay, so I gotta show, I gotta prepare for the interview, I got an interview to do, let's go.
[07:14.31]Okay.
[07:30.43]Okay.
[07:31.13]First decision of the morning was made wisely.
[07:34.11]Wither away or exit the bed.
[07:36.04]I mean, we're going to exit the bed.
[07:38.12]Kyle exited his bed and took a quick glance around his bedroom.
[07:43.98]Uh, scavenge.
[07:44.28]Bugs.
[07:44.40]Okay.
[07:44.50]Eat him.
[07:44.70]I did that for five hours?
[08:16.41]Wait, there's a... Wait, hold on.
[08:19.72]There's a system in this game where... Alright.
[08:22.40]I did that for six hours.
[08:23.70]Alright, open the closet.
[08:26.98]It was dark and he could only really see his hanging shirts.
[08:30.86]Choose an outfit.
[08:31.82]Oh, at some point he's acting, at some point he isn't.
[08:43.93]Suit of armor.
[08:45.13]Kyle was unsure of what exactly caused him to decide to wear his armor, but it felt like the right thing to do.
[08:50.31]Okay.
[08:52.30]After much squeezing and sweating, Kyle managed to wrap the metal suit around his dumpy self.
[08:57.20]Which would be hard.
[08:58.54]I get it.
[09:00.86]I get it.
[09:01.72]Trust me.
[09:03.78]All right.
[09:04.56]Sit at the desk.
[09:08.45]Write notes for the interview.
[09:10.73]Kyle wrote down his first question.
[09:13.65]Are you a mother?
[09:15.83]I guess.
[09:16.43]You ever eaten a raw whole egg?
[09:18.09]Sure.
[09:18.19]What's your funniest story?
[09:19.37]What's your guilty pleasure?
[09:21.50]Okay.
[09:21.60]Am I wasting time here?
[09:23.28]Should I not be doing this?
[09:44.40]Alright, draw.
[09:45.16]Open the side draw of his desk and grab one of the items stored there.
[09:52.18]Uh, a key.
[09:53.06]Cool.
[09:56.17]This is not Bakery Simulator anymore.
[09:57.81]No, it's not.
[10:00.53]What about use the key?
[10:03.85]Oh, yeah.
[10:04.31]Get the change, too.
[10:05.27]Alright, so let's go.
[10:09.53]Back to the room.
[10:11.83]I did everything.
[10:12.51]Let's go.
[10:12.81]Okay, we have to exit.
[10:13.43]I only have four hours.
[10:17.31]I think I have to leave.
[10:18.27]Check the locked door?
[10:20.67]I've been walking around eating bugs and... Sitting in... It's been 30 hours.
[10:27.73]I have to leave.
[10:32.45]Leave apartment.
[10:35.47]Uh... Visit the tech store.
[10:39.96]Buy batteries with change.
[10:41.22]I can do that.
[10:43.34]Okay.
[10:43.74]Now what?
[10:45.10]Kyle hurried to the set.
[10:47.90]Sitting across from his host chair was a glamorous woman with an air of genuinity.
[10:54.19]As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.
[10:56.85]Okay.
[10:59.05]Good evening, Kyle, she said, looking him in the eyes.
[11:01.99]I've been looking forward to being here.
[11:04.39]Last second batteries, that's right.
[11:06.13]Kyle responded.
[11:09.27]Well, this is the funny answer, so we're going to do the regular answer.
[11:14.50]And I as well, Rachel, answered Kyle, extending his hand in greeting.
[11:18.35]You are a most welcome guest.
[11:21.07]Shake hands.
[11:22.21]After other mild exchanges of pleasantries, Kyle and Rachel were prompted to take their places for the broadcast.
[11:27.65]Okay.
[11:28.43]The moment after seating, the studio lights brightened and the cameras clicked on.
[11:34.68]Start broadcast.
[11:36.38]Good evening, everyone, said Kyle, looking at the camera.
[11:39.34]Welcome back to Stay Up Late with Kyle.
[11:43.65]Kyle vomited all of the horrible things he had eaten earlier onto the floor.
[11:50.37]Rachel looked at Kyle, concerned, gave a couple coughs, and decided to play it cool and keep the show running.
[11:57.84]Kyle stopped, then vomited again, then continued with a shaky voice.
[12:03.02]Tonight, I have the pleasure of interviewing the lovely Rachel May, who needs no more introduction.
[12:11.24]Kyle motioned to Rachel who smiled and waved at the camera.
[12:14.34]Hello Kyle.
[12:15.30]She said, I'm glad to be here.
[12:19.82]Well, I'm sure we'll have a lot to discuss.
[12:24.96]So we might as well dive right in, said Kyle.
[12:27.72]Alright, let's go.
[12:29.64]I'm very ready, said Rachel with a winning smile.
[12:32.44]How do I just draw?
[12:34.42]Kyle produced the notes he had taken earlier.
[12:36.45]Alright, you ever eaten a whole egg?
[12:38.34]Hey, Rachel, ever eaten a raw egg hole?
[12:40.54]Asked Kyle.
[12:42.71]Um, like, shell and all?
[12:44.81]Asked Rachel.
[12:46.19]Kyle continued.
[12:47.57]I, uh, like, a lot.
[12:50.35]It's really bad, though, so sometimes I spit it back up.
[12:52.39]You guys probably hear my mouth going like... There was a silence.
[13:02.62]It actually gets easier the more you do it, continued Kyle, without losing momentum.
[13:06.50]So don't start, I say.
[13:08.52]Rachel chose not to... Where the fuck did we end up?
[13:12.81]Where are we?
[13:13.17]Where are we?
[13:13.77]Where are we?
[13:14.33]Where are we?
[13:14.71]I think the story I always remember is the first time I tried to make dinner for my family.
[13:19.01]Okay.
[13:21.09]In the soup I made, I swapped out the water with milk and tipped the whole jar of salt in the pot.
[13:28.74]While my family was sick from trying to eat it, I swiped their things and locked myself in my room.
[13:34.06]Okay.
[13:36.28]Rachel laughed elegantly.
[13:39.49]What's your guilty pleasure?
[13:40.37]Hold on, let me do this right.
[14:24.69]You need to be able to see the microphone.
[14:29.86]Then I gotta be like this.
[14:32.10]Ready?
[14:38.36]Well, that's an easy answer, said Rachel, dipping pickles in chocolate sauce.
[14:46.32]It might sound strange, but it's tangy and sweet at the same time.
[14:50.09]I eat it far too often.
[14:51.65]Rachel smiled sweetly.
[14:55.78]After reading his final question, Kyle looked up from his paper.
[15:01.08]Well, Rachel, he said, I think that's all I was planning on asking you.
[15:06.94]If that's the case, Kyle, may I ask you something in return?
[15:10.67]Asked Rachel, smiling one more time.
[15:14.05]Why exactly did you decide to wear a suit of armor today?
[15:18.61]Before Kyle could answer, the camera shut down.
[15:21.15]The broadcast was over.
[15:23.82]Kyle returned home knowing the interview had gone well.
[15:35.99]But as he lay in bed and drifted to sleep, he felt that perhaps something was still missing.
[15:43.49]Did I lose?
[15:53.62]He's moving like a TikToker.
[15:59.52]I'm having fun doing this.
[16:04.91]Can I do the... I'm doing the voices thing still?
[16:08.59]Is this still funny to you?
[16:13.89]That was the most unfunny bit.
[16:15.60]That's welcome.
[16:19.72]Okay.
[16:20.80]I'm gonna do it one more time.
[16:27.22]Okay, one more time, that's it.
[16:29.97]I'm gonna get really animated.
[17:02.01]Kyle hurried to the set.
[17:04.93]Sitting across from his host chair was a glamorous woman with an air of genuinity.
[17:10.95]As Kyle approached her, Rachel looked up and smiled.
[17:15.95]Good evening, Kyle, she said, looking him in the eyes.
[17:18.89]I've been looking forward to being here.
[17:22.65]Kyle responded.
[17:25.57]Kyle stretched his arms wide, tilted his neck upwards, and...
[17:30.90]was interrupted by his producer telling him and Rachel that it was time to start the show.
[17:37.22]Kyle shoved his producer out of the way, spread his arms wide, and began to scream loudly.
[17:49.53]He began to rotate slowly, screaming throughout, lightly brushing his hands against the faces of Rachel and his producer.
[18:05.23]After several minutes, Kyle was finished.
[18:07.81]He slowly put his hands to his sides and smiled.
[18:13.85]I'm ready, said Kyle.
[18:17.82]Rachel blinked at Kyle, shrugged, and walked over to her seat.
[18:22.76]A moment after seating, the studio lights brightened and the cameras clicked on.
[18:27.64]Good evening, everyone, said Kyle, looking at the camera.
[18:30.60]Welcome back to Stay Up Late with Kyle.
[18:34.40]Kyle vomited all of the horrible things he had eaten earlier onto the floor.
[18:39.88]Rachel looked at Kyle, concerned, gave a couple coughs, and decided to play it cool and keep the show running.
[18:46.99]Kyle stopped, then vomited again, then continued with a shaky voice.
[18:52.41]Tonight I have the pleasure of interviewing the lovely Rachel May, who needs no more introduction.
[19:00.77]Kyle motioned to Rachel, who smiled and waved at the camera.
[19:03.85]Hello, Kyle!
[19:04.81]She said, I'm glad to be here.
[19:12.09]Why would sound come out and I don't move my mouth?
[19:14.01]Alright, I'm done.
[19:16.84]I'm done with this one.
[19:18.90]Fuck, I want to play this game, though.
[19:20.28]I kind of want to... Let me just play it for a minute.
[19:26.32]Let me play the game for a minute.
[19:36.47]It's actually very well done voice acting.
[19:42.25]Well, I'm sure we'll have a lot to discuss.
[19:47.39]So we might as well dive right in.
[19:49.37]This is not bakery.
[19:51.35]No, this is not still bakery simulator.
[19:53.34]Wait, I'm still like voice.
[19:56.10]Hold on.
[20:00.49]This is the same person, the same guy that did Gabriel?
[20:04.23]Who did the bosses from Ultra Kill?
[20:05.69]Are you shitting me?
[20:08.23]I told you that fucking guy was talented.
[20:09.49]Alright, what happened?
[20:14.92]Why does this look so weird now?
[20:20.64]This looks... What happened?
[20:23.46]Oh, there we go, okay.
[20:31.13]I'm gonna play.
[20:32.59]I'm gonna play for like 10 minutes.
[20:34.77]Can I play?
[20:36.43]Leave me alone.
[20:36.92]I'm playing.
[20:38.92]I'm very ready, said Rachel with a winning smile.
[20:44.26]Kyle produced the notes he had taken earlier.
[20:47.68]Okay, I'm not starting with this.
[20:50.62]I'm not starting with this.
[20:54.86]What's your guilty pleasure?
[20:55.96]We all have one.
[20:56.92]What's your guilty pleasure?
[21:02.01]That's really not that weird.
[21:03.36]That's really not that weird.
[21:04.60]People put all kinds of weird shit on pickles, okay?
[21:29.06]Alright, what's a funny story you have?
[21:32.16]Okay.
[21:32.32]Ugh.
[21:56.53]While my family was sick from trying to eat it, I swiped their things and locked myself in my room.
[22:01.80]Oh, that's what I missed and I skipped.
[22:06.28]Rachel laughed elegantly.
[22:09.06]Kyle decided to move.
[22:10.46]Yeah, yeah, moved on.
[22:11.20]Kyle asked another question.
[22:12.31]Are you a mother?
[22:13.19]Rachel, I and many others would love to know.
[22:15.23]Did I do something wrong?
[22:16.49]Are you a mother?
[22:17.69]Kyle, well, being a single woman with a career, she answered, that's not something that has crossed my mind.
[22:25.42]Who is this again?
[22:27.39]Who is this?
[22:29.03]Who is this person?
[22:30.87]Rachel smiled genuinely at Kyle.
[22:33.47]Redo the whole game.
[22:34.29]Oh, right.
[22:34.97]Very reasonable indeed, said Kyle.
[22:37.11]Okay, so yeah, then the interview's over.
[22:40.07]Hey, Rachel, have you eaten a raw egg whole?
[22:41.43]Asked Kyle.
[22:43.75]Um, like, shell and all?
[22:45.85]Asked Rachel.
[22:47.93]I have.
[22:49.05]It's bad.
[22:49.55]Sometimes I spit it back up.
[22:50.79]There was a silence.
[22:51.57]Yep.
[22:51.67]I remember this.
[22:52.81]Uh-huh.
[22:52.95]Okay.
[22:53.13]Fixed all the planning.
[22:54.19]Alright.
[22:54.37]Okay.
[23:09.52]What the fuck?
[23:12.54]Alright, I screwed the whole thing up.
[23:14.30]I'm going back.
[23:15.84]Repeat.
[23:16.24]Reset.
[23:16.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:18.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[23:19.56]I screwed it up.
[23:20.04]Okay, here we go.
[23:26.33]I'm gonna wither away.
[23:27.91]I wasted way too much time.
[23:29.83]Wait, what?
[23:30.15]That's it?
[23:30.69]Oh, okay.
[23:30.99]Alright, so what do I need from here?
[23:51.09]I'm gonna choose an outfit.
[23:51.97]Okay.
[23:52.93]I'm gonna wear the suit.
[23:53.99]Okay.
[23:54.39]So now... I think I'm gonna leave.
[23:55.87]Wait.
[23:55.99]Sit at the desk and get the batteries, right?
[24:18.24]um change kyle scooped up the change get out get out get out get out okay move to the kitchen uh open the fridge kyle opened the fridge intending to find something to eat eat crust on the fridge wall eat the fridge eat the how do you eat you can't eat the fridge can I no I would eat condiments
[24:46.23]That'll get like all the gross I didn't brush my teeth yet out of my mouth.
[24:51.15]If there's one thing that will cover that up, it's a bottle of ketchup.
[24:53.67]Okay.
[24:54.67]That actually sounds good.
[24:55.49]I'm not kidding.
[25:12.61]Kyle spewed the excess condiment slurry across the kitchen, covering the furniture and walls.
[25:18.45]Okay.
[25:19.01]Kyle continued until all of the condiments had been emptied.
[25:22.76]Not to eat by itself, but just put that on something.
[25:24.94]That doesn't sound like a bad combo.
[25:29.56]Alright, I got 10 hours.
[25:30.64]Check the pantry.
[25:31.56]Kyle wanted to access the pantry, but found it was locked with a small keyhole.
[25:37.23]Mayo, horseradish, and ketchup.
[25:39.73]That's probably...
[25:42.59]horseradish is delicious with anything and ketchup and mayonnaise is just thousand island dressing so it's just thousand island with a little bit of kick to it what makes that what's what's the problem with that all right the key is for the pantry but thousand island sucks big mac sauce yeah
[26:11.18]Alright, yeah, I can.
[26:12.42]Alright, so let's go back to the hallway.
[26:13.48]I only have a few... You gotta get out of the house immediately.
[26:20.57]Oh, I can haunt.
[26:21.13]Was he fulfilling his spooky, ethereal role that he'd accepted while lying in bed this morning?
[26:38.21]Kyle realized he had no other choice.
[26:40.39]He must spend his day spooking about.
[26:45.41]Kyle decided he should make a plan about who or where he should spook.
[26:51.99]At the interview.
[26:53.45]Kyle thought that it would be best to continue his daily course, but with a twist.
[26:59.50]Today, he would still go to his studio, but instead of conducting an interview, he would haunt.
[27:05.08]Thousand Island is incredible.
[27:06.21]Yeah, what are you guys talking?
[27:07.49]Thousand Island is good on lots of stuff.
[27:12.10]Excitedly, Kyle made his way to the studio early to find the best spot to conduct his ghostly duties.
[27:18.04]I don't love Thousand Island dressing, but I don't hate it.
[27:20.87]The studio was empty.
[27:22.13]Being so early, the crew wouldn't arrive for several hours.
[27:25.23]Okay.
[27:26.41]Kyle gleefully skipped around the building, finding the best spot for himself to hide.
[27:30.69]Okay.
[27:32.25]After searching for some time, Kyle decided to hide behind the guest chair.
[27:36.67]Okay.
[27:37.61]Rubens, yep.
[27:38.23]Kyle quickly placed himself down and drew his legs to his chest.
[27:43.28]Soon, the crew began to arrive and set up for the interview that night.
[27:48.18]Invisible to all senses, Kyle went undetected.
[27:51.62]He watched as cameras were set up, screens were turned on, and pages were flipped.
[27:56.96]Within an hour, Rachel walked into the studio.
[27:59.72]This is it.
[28:02.18]Hey, everyone, said Rachel, smiling kindly.
[28:05.35]I'm ready to get prepped.
[28:06.73]Who do I need to talk to first?
[28:09.83]Kyle's producer approached her.
[28:12.57]Here I come.
[28:12.87]He's doing a little bit of trolling.
[28:14.26]Yeah, I'm doing a little bit of trolling, whatever.
[28:16.50]Why?
[28:16.64]What's TF?
[28:40.22]Why can I not see that?
[28:41.16]I still have money.
[29:07.75]Am I still dead?
[29:08.17]How many endings are there?
[29:09.67]Dude, Kyle is literally me.
[29:10.83]We have the wrestling one.
[29:38.39]Should I try the wrestling quiz?
[29:40.43]I feel like I would do pretty good on it.
[29:41.61]All right, let me get it.
[29:57.49]I'll try.
[29:57.81]I'll try it.
[30:00.71]I can't promise that I'm going to do well, but I think I'll get probably half of these.
[30:06.60]You have a reptilian brain?
[30:11.69]Okay.
[30:12.13]Sporkle.
[30:13.71]Let's get it.
[30:14.53]How do I do this?
[30:21.65]Tic-Tac trivia.
[30:24.01]Oh, this is, wait, there's a lots of thick six letter word in 1980s songs.
[30:30.69]Okay.
[30:31.61]Television cakes.
[30:33.61]This looks fun.
[30:34.79]Pick that movie.
[30:35.79]This looks fun.
[30:36.84]This is fun.
[30:37.42]Isn't it?
[30:39.72]Let's pick that movie.
[30:47.39]Dude, let's go.
[30:48.29]Pick that movie?
[30:50.33]Hold on.
[30:56.27]Um, how does it work?
[30:59.25]Let's pick that movie.
[31:00.23]Can you pick the movie that fits each clue?
[31:02.57]Alright, I'm excited.
[31:06.11]Alright, hold on.
[31:08.04]Let me get this set up.
[31:21.79]the movie quiz.
[31:23.05]Okay.
[31:32.24]How do I where is it?
[31:32.96]Let me close this.
[31:44.14]So the hundred people left.
[31:46.56]That's all right.
[31:47.08]It's fine.
[31:50.22]Where the fuck is this window?
[31:52.59]I have so much trouble capturing windows on stream.
[31:56.55]It never seems to work the way that I want it to.
[32:02.50]Where is it?
[32:05.56]I can see it in my preview, but I can't hold on.
[32:11.11]Okay.
[32:13.27]It should be there.
[32:22.76]Come on, I want to play!
[32:32.31]It won't show up.
[32:39.74]I can see it in the preview, but I can't see it actually on the window.
[32:43.32]You're doing your best, yeah.
[32:45.24]Make it work.
[32:45.82]I'm trying.
[32:46.38]What do you think I'm doing?
[32:54.04]There it is.
[32:55.98]So what the fuck?
[32:56.90]OBS, what are you doing?
[33:02.46]It says it's got it.
[33:10.45]I don't get it.
[33:11.13]I'll try it again.
[33:17.97]Hello, it's my birthday.
[33:19.55]Someone help dad.
[33:20.41]I should be pulling this.
[33:22.67]It's just not.
[33:32.66]Come on!
[33:41.71]What the heck?
[33:47.41]Hold on.
[33:48.77]Let me see if I can do this.
[33:56.35]Every time this happens, I have to restart OBS.
[33:59.15]And I really don't want to do that.
[34:03.31]I might have to, though.
[34:05.08]Because I think it's frozen.
[34:07.98]Alright, alright, alright.
[34:09.04]I'll be right back.
[34:11.02]I physically can't capture this.
[34:14.24]Unless I restart OBS.
[34:16.65]None of you leave.
[34:17.37]If any of you leave, I'll know.
[34:19.19]If any of you leave, I'll know.
[34:21.80]Don't go anywhere if any of you leave.
[34:23.18]I will know.
[34:23.98]I'll know.
[34:24.82]There's 20,000 people.
[34:25.72]There will be 20,000 people when I come back.
[34:27.82]I'll know.
[34:28.14]I'll be back in 30 seconds.
[34:30.11]I just have to turn it off and turn it on again.
[34:32.07]I'll know.
[34:33.07]Don't you dare.
