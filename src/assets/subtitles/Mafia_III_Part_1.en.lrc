[01:20.91]Well, good morning.
[01:23.77]Good morning, everybody.
[01:26.03]Welcome to school.
[01:28.61]It's time for school.
[01:29.43]Did you do your homework?
[01:38.08]I didn't want to do that.
[01:40.64]Did you do your homework?
[01:42.18]You're going to be in big trouble if you don't, young man.
[01:44.22]You're going to be in big trouble.
[01:53.74]Oh, boy.
[01:55.77]Right off the bat, is Twitch Alerts broken?
[02:01.79]Oh, my God.
[02:02.59]Javelin YT with 100 bucks within 10 seconds of the stream starting.
[02:09.13]What's going on with my Twitch Alerts?
[02:12.62]Why can I not hear that?
[02:13.42]I can't hear any sound from this.
[02:17.76]Hmm.
[02:19.54]I don't like that at all.
[02:25.94]Can you get, that's not popping up, is it?
[02:28.92]Let me read what Javelin had to say first.
[02:31.30]Thanks a lot, Javelin.
[02:31.94]That's a lot of money.
[02:32.90]Jerma, you're literally my favorite person ever.
[02:35.62]No amount of bits could ever pay back the countless hours of entertainment you've given me and I can't even put into words how thankful I am that someone as hilarious and truly wonderful as you exists.
[02:46.22]Thank you so much.
[02:48.42]Well, dude, that
[02:51.61]I can't believe, I never thought anyone would ever be saying that about me.
[02:55.97]So, much love, dude.
[02:57.45]That's a very touching thing to say.
[03:01.30]But thank you for the 100 bucks, man.
[03:04.54]And then we also had people coming in with a premium pillow with 100 bits, too.
[03:09.34]Why am I not hearing these, though?
[03:12.47]That's what I want to know.
[03:13.75]I don't know why.
[03:19.86]Doesn't seem to want to be working.
[03:20.98]Let me just test something real quick before we go.
[03:25.02]I have an internet update for you guys.
[03:28.22]It's a good one.
[03:29.64]Hopefully it's a good one.
[03:33.25]Go to Twitch alerts.
[03:34.47]Let me just open this real quick.
[03:41.61]I can't see anything right now in the meantime.
[03:45.53]Test the subscription.
[03:51.29]Okay, I think I know what the problem is.
[03:54.14]And I can fix it in about two seconds here.
[03:58.34]I think I can at least.
[04:03.76]Alright, I'll be right back.
[04:07.02]I will literally be right back in two seconds.
[04:11.21]Thank you, Hal Games.
[04:12.35]I have to restart the stream because Mafia 3 sucks.
[04:18.15]Because I think that's what's wrong.
[04:19.19]It's like taking over that.
[04:21.21]It's like killing the process in the meantime.
[04:23.53]Actually, maybe not.
[04:28.09]Let me see.
[04:28.45]Hold on.
[04:28.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[04:29.17]Let me see if I can do this without having to do that.
[04:33.56]What if this is up on the screen?
[04:34.90]Does this even have audio?
[04:39.58]Yeah, this has audio.
[04:44.18]Huh.
[04:47.56]I wonder if while this is up, it'll work.
[04:55.63]Open the map, yeah.
[05:03.27]I'm just kind of waiting.
[05:06.83]To see if anything comes up.
[05:08.77]Because I don't know why Twitch Alerts is not giving me audio right now.
[05:14.21]I have lots of people to thank.
[05:18.23]Mafia 3.
[05:18.61]We're gonna try Mafia 3.
[05:21.55]You freeze right there!
[05:24.23]Oh, you're clean.
[05:25.21]You're clean.
[05:25.69]Alright, good, good, good.
[05:27.41]Wait, did I sense a little bit of movement from you?
[05:29.91]Don't you fucking move!
[05:31.75]I'm a quick draw.
[05:34.75]That's so fast.
[05:37.18]Yeah, it's not working.
[05:38.10]What the fuck?
[05:43.87]Hold on.
[05:45.79]That's not gonna work for me.
[05:47.29]Hold on a second, guys.
[05:48.25]Hmm.
[05:57.75]The same problem I had with this before is gonna happen again, isn't it?
[06:09.41]Hmm.
[06:12.17]Alright, what if...
[06:14.97]Alright, quick, somebody resubscribe.
[06:18.88]I wonder if like this one works.
[06:20.84]And I don't know if I must have screwed something up.
[06:23.48]Either that or Mafia is just taking over my line.
[06:27.78]Which that's annoying if it is.
[06:34.65]now it's just uh Twitch alerts anything coming through ah alright I I'm gonna have to be right back here because this is gonna happen till the end of the stream so hang tight I will be right back in like less than 30 seconds okay don't move I'll be right back hey it works I told you I'd be right back everyone calm down calm down calm down
[07:08.88]Fixed it.
[07:09.38]I told you.
[07:09.82]I told you Mafia 3 was a piece of shit.
[07:12.20]Told you it was Mafia 3's fault.
[07:14.80]For taking over my lines.
[07:18.82]Alright.
[07:19.70]So, let me just make a tweet real quick.
[07:21.76]I'm gonna go to this screen.
[07:22.94]And where is the pop-out so I can say thank you to some people?
[07:27.25]Thank... What the hell is that?
[07:31.07]What does that sound?
[07:33.01]Is that an ad?
[07:34.13]Oh no, it's Mafia.
[07:37.17]This is like the theme song?
[07:43.93]Alright, so.
[07:46.87]Oh, it's just a... I almost just said Jimmy Neutron.
[07:52.25]Yes, it's Jimmy Neutron.
[07:56.74]Alright, hold on.
[07:57.34]I'm going to mute this for a second.
[07:58.84]Okay, it's muted.
[08:03.26]So, hi, everybody.
[08:04.68]How are you?
[08:06.79]I would love to say hi to everybody.
[08:08.83]Thank you, Dan Krav Draken, for your subscription.
[08:11.72]Premium Pillow for the 100 bits.
[08:13.60]McPeruna for four months.
[08:16.25]Rat Bagel Nelson.
[08:17.99]Rat Bag Nelson for 100 bits.
[08:20.97]Taub Hal Games, thanks for the subscription, dude.
[08:23.28]Much appreciated.
[08:25.02]And then we had Javelin right off the bat.
[08:27.96]The stream started in 10 seconds and he gave 10,000 bits.
[08:31.08]There was no notification for it.
[08:33.50]But I want to make sure I say thanks again to you, dude.
[08:35.98]It's very generous, very kind of you.
[08:39.05]And let's get going.
[08:40.09]I'm going to hit the tweet button so people know what's going on, you know, on the Twitter, on Twitterscape.
[08:48.27]Alright, I can bring this back up.
[08:52.86]Going into the Shadow Realm?
[08:54.84]What does that mean?
[08:58.28]I can't wait for this portion of the stream to be muted.
[09:00.34]That's gonna be great.
[09:04.80]Okay.
[09:06.56]Change the scene.
[09:07.38]Move this, move that.
[09:10.74]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the play, Mafia III.
[09:13.84]You are worth any amount of bits.
[09:16.22]I don't know about that.
[09:18.78]Well, I appreciate it nonetheless.
[09:23.39]I'm glad you enjoy, uh, hanging out.
[09:25.85]It means a lot to me that you just want to hang out here.
[09:31.99]Good morning!
[09:35.77]Start a new game.
[09:38.07]I didn't see any of the, uh, cutscenes or anything, so... We're gonna watch the cutscenes and... Laugh, I guess.
[09:47.17]Hey, what's going on, Crit-eer?
[09:48.81]Or Crit-eer?
[09:49.47]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[09:51.09]New game!
[09:53.07]Medium.
[09:54.25]No aim assist because we're good at video games.
[09:59.27]Let me know if it's too loud or too soft.
[10:00.73]Let me know if it's a Goldilocks problem, you know?
[10:06.14]Five beams.
[10:08.58]Mafia III takes place in a fictionalized version of the American South in 1968.
[10:13.14]We sought to create an authentic and immersive experience that captures this very turbulent time and place, including depictions of racism.
[10:19.67]Uh-oh.
[10:20.65]We find the racist beliefs, language, and behaviors of some characters in the game abhorrent, but believe it is vital to include these depictions in order to tell Lincoln Clay's story.
[10:29.61]Okay.
[10:30.95]Most importantly, we felt that we ought to include this very real shameful part of our past.
[10:33.57]We've been offensive to the millions... Okay, so it's got some... It's got some language.
[10:41.84]Should I put on like a... I wonder if I should put like a language thing on this.
[10:51.27]I underestimated how far he was going to go.
[10:56.59]What he was willing to do.
[10:58.43]This is pretty good.
[11:00.94]And enjoy local cuisine at one of our five-star restaurants.
[11:05.38]Killing them wasn't enough.
[11:07.54]Music's on point.
[11:08.22]I was using them to send a message.
[11:11.53]What was- I didn't even play Mafia 1 or Mafia 2.
[11:16.82]What happened in Mafia 1 and Mafia 2?
[11:18.40]Hey Kaldaka, thanks for the 12 months.
[11:19.78]Doesn't matter what the first two were about.
[11:23.10]Alright, let's just get into the game.
[11:48.12]Mafia 2 sucked.
[11:48.90]I love how somebody said Mafia 2 sucked and then somebody immediately says Mafia 2 is great.
[11:58.81]Can I play as this guy?
[11:59.81]Yeah.
[11:59.93]Thanks, Gwen Blade.
[12:00.45]Welcome, dude.
[12:00.81]Is everything we need to burn?
[12:14.15]Yeah, that's it.
[12:15.49]I grab the keys to the truck, then we can get the fuck out of here.
[12:19.63]Alright, let's get the keys.
[12:23.45]Lincoln, pick up the keys.
[12:27.75]Where are the keys?
[12:29.28]Oh, that like a holding.
[12:30.74]OK, God, I think the game crashed.
[12:36.54]What?
[12:37.58]Why did that happen?
[12:41.93]What is- Oh boy, that's not good.
[12:45.23]Why can I see my mouse?
[12:47.79]What the fuck is going on?
[12:51.23]Alright, something just went real wrong.
[12:53.74]Real quick.
[12:56.70]Can you guys see my, like, mouse on the screen?
[12:59.78]Oh, that's so annoying.
[13:06.14]He's like, hey, can you get those keys?
[13:10.07]Why don't you get the keys?
[13:12.88]This is going to drive me crazy.
[13:13.70]Hold on.
[13:14.00]I need to reset the... Oh, look.
[13:17.06]The father and son mouse are out to go get groceries.
[13:24.32]Okay.
[13:24.84]This is... Give me a second.
[13:31.58]I have shit-faced vision right now.
[13:33.27]Which one is the real mouse?
[13:36.21]Okay.
[13:36.47]Controls.
[13:38.01]Can I turn... No.
[13:40.87]Go back.
[13:41.99]Mouse.
[13:42.41]No.
[13:47.92]I have to like reset the resolution or something.
[13:50.72]Yeah.
[13:50.98]Alright, opening it again.
[14:00.20]And I pressed shift.
[14:01.39]That's what happened.
[14:02.45]OK, it's gone.
[14:04.13]Thanks a lot, Slippy Phil.
[14:09.81]Thanks a lot.
[14:15.03]OK, pick up the keys.
[14:22.03]Keys aren't up here.
[14:22.77]Okay, I'm gonna hit shift again.
[14:24.25]Yeah, that, like, what on Earth?
[14:27.65]What on fucking Earth?
[14:30.87]I pressed shift.
[14:33.19]And it, like, opened up the Steam menu.
[14:37.33]W is to, like, come on, man.
[14:41.96]I pressed shift.
[14:44.50]Hitting, like, shift and W at the same time.
[14:46.94]Apparently I'm doing it now.
[14:48.60]It's not doing anything.
[14:49.40]And now I have the mouse back.
[14:54.81]Well, I would love to pick the keys up, but there's a problem.
[14:59.86]Your game sucks.
[15:05.34]Take off your shift key.
[15:11.69]It's re-tapping again.
[15:13.77]My tab might be pressed.
[15:15.45]My tab is definitely... Tab is map.
[15:20.48]So that's not pressed right now.
[15:22.55]So this is W. I'm going to just press shift.
[15:26.47]I'm pressing shift just without pressing W. W, shift.
[15:33.73]Now I can't run.
[15:36.67]Couldn't I have run before by holding shift?
[15:41.73]This is very odd.
[15:46.76]Try Alt-F4.
[15:48.56]Look, all I had to do was grab the keys.
[15:50.30]Alright, let's get the keys.
[15:55.91]Okay, there's a guy in here.
[15:58.87]Alright, I don't think that guy is the keys.
[16:01.13]That guy's not the keys either.
[16:03.13]Okay.
[16:18.70]Alright, I'll drive.
[16:22.02]Let's go.
[16:22.56]Alright, get in the car.
[16:33.42]How do I get in the car?
[16:35.91]Do I have to walk out this way?
[16:36.99]Alright, get in the armored truck.
[16:42.77]Now I'm sprinting.
[16:44.91]I can sprint real fast.
[16:46.15]That's awesome.
[16:52.52]That's a E. Let's go.
[16:56.44]Drive to the Federal Reserve.
[17:02.72]This is very... Alright, let's do it.
[17:07.70]I think I might have to mute the music.
[17:10.86]As good as the music probably is in this game.
[17:14.00]Sorry.
[17:16.49]Because this whole stream is going to get muted if it's not.
[17:26.30]Okay.
[17:28.36]So I guess there's like some really strong language in this game, so viewer discretion is advised.
[17:33.54]This is like an R-rated game, I guess, from what I understand.
[17:36.46]Yeah, that guy was just in the way.
[17:47.35]I'm going way too fast for this.
[17:49.19]This thing is huge.
[17:50.21]We're talking really calmly for how psycho I'm driving.
[17:52.93]It's just like GTA.
[17:53.43]Let's go.
[17:53.75]Okay.
[18:18.18]They're talking about not going to prison.
[18:19.90]Yeah, we're not going to prison.
[18:22.53]Not anytime soon.
[18:23.91]Don't worry.
[18:27.25]Yeah, about that prison thing.
[18:30.17]We're not going.
[18:31.41]Yeah, no taxes.
[18:34.60]Fuck taxes.
[18:36.04]We're not going to prison for taxes.
[18:38.52]Bullshit.
[18:39.64]Fucking taxes.
[18:51.86]Good frames.
[18:52.60]Yeah, I know.
[18:53.26]This is running like shit right now.
[18:55.00]Remember, the truck is armored.
[18:56.30]That makes sense, right?
[18:57.82]I am not locked at 30 frames.
[18:59.32]It's just kind of running like crap.
[19:01.20]I'll probably drop some stuff.
[19:02.14]Jesus Christ.
[19:17.94]So they do the same like GTA?
[19:19.44]Hey, GTA!
[19:20.36]Did he just say we're gonna attract the cops?
[19:22.56]We didn't attract the cops already?
[19:39.20]That's like the fifth car that was exploded.
[19:41.76]We're going like 90 miles per hour.
[19:46.74]This is not safe to go this fast on these streets.
[19:49.30]Did I lose?
[19:49.72]I think I lost.
[19:51.96]I think I lost, yeah.
[20:09.32]Ah, whoops.
[20:11.66]Ah, shit.
[20:13.22]You screwed it up again.
[20:14.96]None of this makes any sense.
[20:16.42]That can't be how it happened.
[20:17.88]No, it is how it happened.
[20:34.13]That's unbelievable.
[20:35.29]That was great.
[20:38.67]There's no way he drove 90 miles per hour in a 30 and blew up four cars and then drove over a medium There's no way I don't believe it That's hilarious Thanks, thanks a lot Irma guarded steer I
[21:02.15]Barry's subscription.
[21:02.85]Thanks a lot, PremiumPillow.
[21:05.53]BingleJelly.
[21:06.85]BingleJelly for two months.
[21:09.09]SlippyPhil.
[21:09.72]Thanks for your subscription.
[21:11.62]Okay, don't fail the first mission.
[21:13.98]I need to know what happens, you know?
[21:15.46]Sometimes we can see what happens.
[21:22.98]No, that's impossible.
[21:23.84]There's no way that's how this happens.
[21:25.63]That's just not possible.
[21:27.25]Alright, one crash.
[21:28.71]It's okay.
[21:28.99]Crashed one to one guy.
[21:29.79]It's not a big deal.
[21:44.11]Now the damn 20 tick right on these cars.
[21:46.04]Let's slow it down.
[21:46.94]It's 75, I know.
[21:48.54]That's too fast.
[22:06.97]I do like how the rear view mirror is right there, so you can see exactly what's behind you.
[22:12.76]I still can't get over that game over screen, it's perfect.
[22:19.28]Oh shit, I shot the gun.
[22:20.26]I've never seen the van go that fast when I played this.
[22:39.67]Well, I can assure you I do not have any hacks enabled.
[22:44.21]I can promise you that.
[22:47.03]Thought I'm going too fast again.
[22:50.95]90 again.
[22:52.37]I gotta slow down because this is where I went over the edge.
[22:57.83]Even the braking is like causing problems.
[23:04.50]Yeah.
[23:07.12]Alright.
[23:10.46]Ramp around.
[23:11.30]What's going on?
[23:13.12]It's Mystify?
[23:14.24]It's Mustify.
[23:18.78]Hopefully the game doesn't run like this shit.
[23:21.54]Oh, man.
[23:22.34]I just murdered that guy.
[23:24.52]Just murdered that guy right in front of the mission door.
[23:26.98]Just get there quick before the police come.
[23:30.02]Thank God.
[23:32.69]Alright, we like skipping every cutscene.
[23:34.47]Is that the goal here?
[23:36.53]I think that might be the goal.
[23:39.09]Alright, the fucking 30s milkman just gave me that shit.
[23:41.94]Okay, cool.
[23:44.58]Backing up to the loading dock.
[23:53.30]Some of these fellas might get a little rough with the language.
[23:56.31]Ain't like I've never been called a nigga before.
[23:58.77]I know, but I'm just saying if I go along with it, ain't nothing personal.
[24:03.24]The only thing I care about is getting our hands on that money.
[24:08.03]Money, money, money.
[24:15.83]Oh, jeez.
[24:17.35]What?
[24:17.99]I thought it was teleported inside the building.
[24:19.39]Game's 80% cutscenes.
[24:20.45]Alright.
[24:27.92]Easy, guys.
[24:28.18]Easy, easy, easy.
[24:35.63]Should I just start shooting these guys?
[24:41.85]So I'm like a Federal Reserve employee?
[25:05.58]This is Metal Gear Solid 4.
[25:07.16]Oh, I have to get the money.
[25:09.29]Okay.
[25:09.61]I wish I could run in here.
[25:11.17]I got these for free so you can have them.
[25:12.67]Well, thank you, Bill Nye.
[25:13.97]Alright, money is over here in the back.
[25:38.29]Pick it up.
[25:42.53]Federal Reserve employee.
[25:44.01]I don't know.
[25:46.77]Alright, let's go.
[25:58.74]Need to check that scattergun.
[26:00.84]Scattergun?
[26:02.12]Still in training.
[26:03.02]Who has a scattergun?
[26:04.30]One last goddamn thing for me to worry about.
[26:06.89]You can pick it up on the way out.
[26:11.95]Oh, wow.
[26:12.17]I didn't know Bill Nye watched Twitch.
[26:15.64]This way.
[26:18.48]I ain't seen y'all around these parts before.
[26:20.52]What?
[26:20.66]There are red blips on the mini-map.
[26:23.18]He just got out of the service.
[26:24.86]And my cousin's been trying to get on here for over a year now.
[26:28.28]Was in the Navy for two tours.
[26:30.02]Got medals falling out of his ass.
[26:32.70]Government tells him thanks, but no thanks.
[26:35.00]That's a crock of shit if I ever heard one.
[26:37.54]Sad day when a God-fearing white man can't get a job.
[26:41.65]I wish I could just swing this and just hit this guy right in the head.
[26:44.39]Just like swing it around like a lasso and smash the guy.
[26:53.92]What are we waiting for him to open the door?
[26:59.76]You bastards better not be playing with each other back there.
[27:06.50]Why is that guy locked up?
[27:15.57]Are these guys in jail with all the gold?
[27:18.69]No, this is not like this is in a jail cell.
[27:22.01]I thought they were like in jail with all the money.
[27:24.13]Oh yeah, this is a really secure prison.
[27:27.25]We keep the prisoners here and we keep gold bars.
[27:34.35]That's funny.
[27:34.81]Okay.
[27:46.06]Money means the prisoners don't leave.
[27:57.74]Cool, alright.
[27:58.72]Take out the burner guard?
[28:00.38]This guy?
[28:00.66]Press Q for a silent takedown.
[28:03.14]Okay.
[28:27.11]Fucking smash this guy's head.
[28:28.37]That was awesome.
[28:29.80]Can I throw him in the fire?
[28:31.12]Alright, like put him into the burner for fuel.
[28:33.16]Get in there.
[28:54.54]Deal with the guards.
[28:56.08]It's a hitman.
[28:56.64]I gotta hide him, right?
[28:58.64]Where do I hide him?
[29:01.62]Oh, wait a minute.
[29:02.87]This is not... Why am I carrying him?
[29:08.75]I don't think I should be doing this, but, you know.
[29:10.61]Oh, you see this?
[29:25.47]Come here, you!
[29:26.07]Fuck!
[29:33.71]Alright, I get it now.
[29:37.68]That was a good square punch right in the face.
[29:39.72]I loved it.
[29:40.12]Alright.
[29:51.08]What the hell was that?
[29:55.15]No, I just creep up on him.
[29:57.87]Stop taking cover.
[30:00.33]Oh, come on.
[30:02.05]Okay.
[30:05.78]That guy apparently doesn't care anymore.
[30:12.72]I slid over the money to punch him in the face.
[30:14.72]Oh, yeah.
[30:15.02]Get speared.
[30:16.02]Oh, that was cool.
[30:25.90]That was real cool.
[30:30.01]Oh, that was awesome.
[30:31.99]Give me your gun.
[30:32.53]Where's his gun?
[30:37.87]What does he got, an Anderson?
[30:40.59]Aiming, move mouse.
[30:42.29]Hold mouse.
[30:43.32]Press mouse.
[30:44.68]You got it.
[30:48.66]Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.
[30:50.10]This combination of Skeletor goddess is legit.
[30:56.17]No gun playthrough.
[31:07.11]Well, I'll be damned.
[31:07.75]Alright, go for it, Godzilla.
[31:15.23]yeah I I do want to I'm gonna I'm gonna make this real clear because I want to make sure it's uh it's addressed this is a period game right so there's gonna be obviously some racial language and stuff like that but I don't want to look over in the chat and see anybody kind of going too far with that type of you know what I mean so
[31:39.87]Don't go overboard with this, because I don't want to look over and see a bunch of racist shit.
[31:44.29]I feel like you guys are better than that, so let's keep that away from this chat.
[31:52.27]That would be great.
[31:55.07]And mods, feel free to, if you see somebody saying something that they shouldn't, then, you know, do what you need to do.
[32:09.42]But I don't want to, like I said, I don't want to turn over here and see, you know, a bunch of, uh, racial kind of nonsense.
[32:17.04]And if I have to turn on sub mode, I will.
[32:20.28]So, just keep that in mind.
[32:23.92]Keep it clean.
[32:29.60]Keep it clean.
[32:45.19]So wait, we weren't workers.
[32:46.83]Oh, wow.
[32:47.51]I can't wait to spear people.
[32:48.55]Hopefully there's a bunch of spears in the game.
[32:53.43]Defend Georgie.
[32:55.07]Alright.
[32:55.31]I'm gonna do it by spearing people.
[33:13.05]Please pick up the shotgun that's over there.
[33:14.47]Nope.
[33:15.67]Alright, fine.
[33:16.09]I'll pick it up.
[33:20.13]Yeah, hold mouse middle to swap.
[33:22.81]Who cares?
[33:23.99]Does anybody really give a shit when we're going to spear the shit out of everybody in this room?
[33:29.50]Cue up that music!
[33:35.60]Oh, what a takedown!
[33:36.56]He's got scoop slammed!
[33:40.74]It's a double scoop slam.
[33:46.69]It doesn't want me to do this.
[33:53.64]Shit, I'm dead.
[33:55.46]What happened to the spear?
[34:00.64]What happened to that guy?
[34:02.24]What happened to that guy?
[34:03.26]What if the guy just tripped and died?
[34:16.45]That was so stupid.
[34:19.05]Alright, let's go.
[34:24.04]Fine, let's do it.
[34:27.96]Yeah, nice shot.
[34:38.16]Oh, what happened to your friend?
[34:44.06]Oh!
[34:44.64]Oh!
[34:46.28]I kidney punched him.
[34:48.15]That guy got kidney punched.
[34:49.27]That was amazing.
[34:51.87]See, people don't... More game developers need to... What's going on?
[34:55.29]What's hurting me?
[34:56.25]Oh, that's not a... I thought that was a wall.
[34:58.79]Not a wall.
[35:00.15]Crouch, please crouch.
[35:02.21]No, don't like... I think that guy just shot himself.
[35:15.02]Show your face.
[35:15.54]See you later.
[35:22.44]Oh, that's so satisfying.
[35:24.10]More games need melee.
[35:25.14]It's like visceral melee.
[35:27.32]It's like my favorite thing ever.
[35:32.88]Oh!
[35:36.00]I wanted to do a spear.
[35:39.78]No witnesses.
[35:41.90]No witnesses.
[35:42.78]Oh.
[35:43.88]Not on my aim assist.
[35:45.34]Not turning that on.
[35:46.04]Alright, I gotta regroup.
[35:52.28]Actually, what do these guys have?
[35:57.37]I'll use this.
[35:57.83]I'm gonna use the riot gun.
[35:59.29]How's the audio?
[35:59.95]Audio good enough?
[36:09.92]Let me help you out.
[36:18.02]Alright, tap the button really fast.
[36:24.50]I knew it!
[36:26.64]Oh no, not tap the button.
[36:30.60]Alright, get it in the green zone.
[36:36.57]What?
[36:38.22]Oh, right.
[36:38.80]Okay, green zone and then E. Got it.
[36:50.27]Thank you very much.
[36:51.39]Audio's too low.
[36:52.05]I'll turn it up.
[36:57.12]I will turn it up if it's too low.
[37:04.35]Turn this down.
[37:06.88]That should be a little better.
[37:08.18]Is that better?
[37:12.24]Huge machine gun?
[37:13.06]Uh, yeah.
[37:14.98]No, don't leave the room until you get some first aid.
[37:20.69]Take all the stuff.
[37:24.23]It's too loud and it's too quiet.
[37:26.38]But it can't be both.
[37:29.17]Yeah, let's do it.
[37:30.95]Boy, I'm gonna unload a lot of bullets, I believe.
[37:32.93]Very shortly here.
[37:44.60]Sammy had men all over the place.
[37:47.13]One of them worked at a cleaner's and stole the uniforms Giorgio Marcano and Lincoln Clay wore on the day of the robbery.
[37:54.05]Another one was a janitor at the Federal Reserve.
[37:56.69]Oh, no, no, no.
[37:57.10]There's no way this is possible.
[37:58.24]And he bought a rough layout.
[38:01.02]Sub only mode, please.
[38:02.38]The robbery of the Federal Reserve was timed perfectly, and none of it would have been possible without the involvement of Sammy Robinson, Lincoln Clay, and the rest of the black mob.
[38:22.94]Alright, we're going to deal with some pedestrians.
[38:28.32]Movie the game.
[38:28.72]You just come from Vietnam?
[38:31.48]That's right.
[38:33.23]I was a Marine in the Pacific.
[38:35.53]You can take it from me.
[38:38.15]Just because you're home doesn't mean you're back.
[38:42.01]You understand?
[38:45.53]People around here, they don't get it.
[38:52.01]You had a chance to use that machine gun, did I?
[38:54.23]I thought it just went into the cutscene.
[38:56.58]Keep your eyes out of trouble.
[39:04.82]Is Mafia 3 just a bunch of cutscenes with some fighting?
[39:10.13]Sorry I'm late.
[39:11.53]Got caught up crossing the bridge.
[39:13.29]Don't worry about it.
[39:15.50]He just turns and like throws the bottle at that guy.
[39:45.09]If we're in the GTA universe, like, somebody's getting that bottle thrown in their face.
[39:48.14]I told you, it's 80% cutscene.
[39:49.34]Ah!
[40:19.01]Alright, let's go.
[40:20.45]Stadium seating 2.
[40:21.31]Thanks for your subscription.
[40:22.85]Welcome, dude.
[40:26.15]Alright, set a route.
[40:27.03]Press tab and open the map and then press left mouse at your destination.
[40:32.08]Alright.
[40:35.28]So, let's do... We're going over here, right?
[40:40.52]Okay.
[40:40.96]Drive to Sammy's Bar.
[40:43.02]You got it.
[40:47.07]Ooh, this thing's got some punch to it.
[40:49.55]This thing's got a little bit of pepper underneath that hood.
[40:54.31]Ooh.
[40:54.53]I just came out of... Yeah, I did not expect him to... Going too fast.
[40:58.89]I just messed up the brand new car.
[41:16.93]That's too bad.
[41:30.65]This FOV?
[41:31.65]What is it?
[41:31.93]What's wrong with it?
[41:33.31]Police awareness.
[41:33.95]The police will attack if you commit crimes, act suspiciously, or break traffic laws within range of their awareness.
[41:39.23]Police awareness is indicated by the blue police awareness indicator.
[41:44.18]You remember Marty and Ron Langford?
[41:46.26]Sure.
[41:50.60]I stopped at the stop sign.
[41:52.22]Yeah, I saw the stop sign, officer.
[41:53.98]Just wanted to make sure I got to it and stopped at it.
[41:57.58]Don't worry about a thing.
[41:59.83]Alright, have a good day.
[42:00.71]Thank you for protecting the streets.
[42:02.37]Tweeting.
[42:03.33]It's going to slow down a little.
[42:05.53]Alright, punch it through the red light.
[42:07.17]Yeah.
[42:07.27]Yeah.
[42:07.51]What's going on, Philip J.N.?
[42:08.25]Thanks for the subscription, dude.
[42:09.21]Welcome.
[42:09.67]Welcome.
[42:25.77]Stop using your mouse for the camera.
[42:27.71]My hand's just like resting on it, I'm sorry.
[42:29.45]Hey officer, should I not be going 105 miles per hour?
[42:33.30]There's an officer right here.
[42:37.04]I'm just going 100 miles per hour.
[42:56.77]That's dangerous speeds.
[42:59.59]Somebody's gonna get hurt going that fast.
[43:02.13]Just got some bits.
[43:04.67]Here you go.
[43:05.03]Thanks a lot, Masterus.
[43:06.75]Masterus Blasterus.
[43:07.75]Thanks a lot, Zombieslayer287.
[43:10.68]Here's your subscription.
[43:11.60]Welcome, dude.
[43:12.22]Welcome.
[43:12.50]Get away!
[43:25.03]I didn't even hurt him.
[43:27.52]Barely touched him.
[43:29.48]Terpo the Magnificent, thank you.
[43:35.46]Go buy yourself a chicken sandwich.
[43:37.40]I promise you that I will use that five dollars to buy a chicken sandwich.
[43:41.18]Promise.
[43:43.96]Shit.
[43:52.71]Oh, come on!
[43:53.67]Really?
[43:54.71]Right in front of a cop?
[43:56.75]What is he doing?
[43:57.51]What are you doing?
[43:58.09]Don't do that!
[44:00.03]Don't shoot at him!
[44:03.21]I did not tell him to do this.
[44:04.40]He's doing it on his own.
[44:05.26]We just got in a car accident and you just started shooting at a cop?
[44:11.74]That's not a good idea.
[44:12.76]You're gonna get us in big trouble.
[44:17.67]Now he got the other cop on us.
[44:23.83]We're going to lose him right here.
[44:28.98]We're just going to lose the hood.
[44:35.76]How the hell am I going to lose these guys?
[44:40.64]This cop is right behind us.
[44:43.62]This just escalated so quickly.
[44:47.69]I don't understand.
[44:50.07]Am I playing in GTA, like, multiplayer online?
[45:06.20]What the fuck is happening?
[45:12.91]Oh my god!
[45:13.75]You gotta lose the cops!
[45:19.03]We have to lose some place.
[45:21.29]I think we lost him.
[45:22.93]Oh shit.
[45:24.11]Oh shit!
[45:29.51]No!
[45:31.46]Get out!
[45:33.88]Am I trying to start the car?
[45:36.96]I'm sorry, I don't think the car's gonna start where it is.
[45:40.92]Yeah, um... I'm not sure you understand this, man.
[45:44.94]We're upside down.
[45:53.38]Well, we got away from the police.
[45:58.46]This is like new car.
[46:06.06]Can we get a new car or do we have to use his car?
[46:08.90]Because his car is no longer with us.
[46:12.60]Press B?
[46:14.08]Press B?
[46:16.16]B doesn't do anything.
[46:18.12]B?
[46:18.42]B?
[46:22.88]Can I get back in and press B?
[46:24.46]I gotta press B to flip.
[46:32.23]I'll flip it myself.
[46:36.63]Shit.
[46:38.03]Come with me.
[46:39.79]While in the car.
[46:40.73]Oh, damn it.
[46:41.79]Alright, well, do we need that car?
[46:43.22]I don't think we do, right?
[46:44.00]Alright, let's go.
[46:50.32]We'll get there.
[46:56.79]Don't worry, eventually we'll get there.
[47:00.89]He's still following me, right?
[47:01.87]Okay, good.
[47:10.88]Oh, baseball!
[47:11.70]I love baseball.
[47:14.06]You want to play baseball?
[47:21.30]Oh, come on.
[47:26.56]Alright.
[47:28.08]We're almost there.
[47:28.66]We just have to lose the cops for a minute.
[47:33.54]That's crazy that even doing any crimes at all, any crimes, can get you in trouble.
[47:40.48]That's kind of ridiculous.
[47:43.54]So, can I steal a car?
[47:48.90]I have to know.
[47:50.70]I have to know.
[47:53.02]I mean, this is an open world game.
[47:54.40]I need to know, you know?
[47:55.62]Right?
[47:56.58]It's one of those situations I have to do it.
[48:01.44]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[48:03.80]Oh, my God!
[48:04.64]Oh, my God!
[48:09.90]Oh, God!
[48:11.92]That was so brutal!
[48:18.88]Can we get in this car?
[48:22.53]I pushed his face into the ground from standing.
[48:29.65]Holy shit.
[48:33.14]Alright, we made it.
[48:36.14]Made it to the bar.
[48:37.28]Alright, let's go.
[48:38.32]Why?
[48:38.50]It's like GTA.
[48:39.34]How come it's not working?
[48:53.98]I thought it was gonna like just instantly go to the mission Welcome home son
[49:14.36]Super early?
[49:14.91]Yeah, it's an early stream.
[49:15.61]I'll be better once I get some of that shine in me.
[49:18.19]I always did love corn whiskey.
[49:21.15]I would like to make a toast.
[49:24.29]Let's make a toast.
[49:26.30]Even though I just drove over like four people.
[49:30.24]When Lincoln first told me he was joining the military, I was against it.
[49:35.52]Too dangerous, I say.
[49:36.60]Wait, what?
[49:37.60]Let those people fight their own war, I say.
[49:40.21]But then I realized... What's going on, Oatwells?
[49:41.67]Oatwheels?
[49:42.13]Thanks for two months, dude.
[49:43.21]Lincoln needed to go out and make his mark.
[49:46.25]And that's precisely what he did.
[49:49.95]I'm so... so proud of you.
[49:56.16]Paul Lincoln!
[49:56.98]Oh, cutscene.
[49:57.74]Ain't seen one of those in a while.
[49:58.74]Paul Lincoln!
[49:59.26]Paul Lincoln!
[50:08.59]Nice seeing you, Lincoln.
[50:16.36]I kept you in my prayers.
[50:17.94]I really appreciate that, father.
[50:20.62]Now who wants to get shit-faced?
[50:25.76]It's hard to explain what it's like coming home from war.
[50:35.00]What's the consensus of this game?
[50:36.30]What's the reviews on it?
[50:39.30]Guilt.
[50:47.23]This wasn't in the schedule.
[50:48.45]Imagine being trapped in a dark room and there's no way out.
[50:56.59]And every fear, every nightmare you ever had is in that room with you.
[51:03.04]Bad, bad, very bad, really.
[51:04.72]From any of it.
[51:07.90]Story is good, but the gameplay is meh.
[51:09.92]And then... One day... A door opens.
[51:15.84]Feels pretty fun so far.
[51:17.18]In regards to just like how, you know, mechanics-wise.
[51:20.33]The thing is... You made your peace with your terror and your fear of death.
[51:27.99]And now part of you... Is afraid to leave it behind.
[51:33.90]But what choice do you have?
[51:35.60]Bad port.
[51:37.20]Every soldier has to walk through that door.
[51:40.76]One way or another.
[51:47.65]Man, whiskey's going to haunt you in the morning.
[51:50.19]Hell, man, just sleep it off.
[51:52.67]Sleep it off.
[51:53.51]I'm going to take the basement.
[51:57.25]The basement?
[51:58.47]Why the fuck do you want to crash down there?
[52:01.17]I'll see you in the morning.
[52:05.00]It's very fun for the first 10 hours because it's really repetitive.
[52:07.38]If it wasn't for the story, I wouldn't have finished it.
[52:13.56]I thought I already did that to the music.
[52:16.32]Why are we getting all this copywritten music?
[52:20.54]Music volume.
[52:22.47]Alright, guys.
[52:22.83]I want you to take a quick listen.
[52:26.93]That's 0.0.
[52:28.05]Is it cutscene cinematic volume?
[52:31.11]Yeah.
[52:31.85]It's part of the cinematic, I think.
[52:35.77]Well, I don't think there's anything I can do about it.
[52:40.47]Go to bed?
[52:40.94]I don't want to go to bed.
[52:47.10]I guess I have to, though.
[52:53.68]Sammies!
[53:02.43]Muted Bozzin coming?
[53:03.49]Yeah, I know, right?
[53:11.27]Alright, do I get to kind of pick what I want to do?
[53:13.19]Talk to Sammy and Ellis.
[53:22.36]This is in-house written.
[53:23.36]It's made for the game.
[53:24.14]Oh, okay.
[53:25.50]That's good to know.
[53:26.08]Are they upstairs?
[53:29.31]Yeah.
[53:31.37]Went to bed with his shoes on.
[53:39.08]We barely have two nickels to rub together, and now we're paying for all that food.
[53:42.52]Jesus Christ.
[53:43.28]Watch that mouth of yours.
[53:44.84]We wouldn't be in this mess if you would have listened to me.
[53:47.06]What mess?
[53:49.18]Mission time.
[53:50.78]Mission time.
[53:51.94]I got it under control.
[53:53.14]Under control?
[53:53.92]God damn it, you need to open your eyes.
[53:55.24]Boy, I'm not warning you again.
[53:56.30]Have it your way, old man.
[54:01.43]Let him be.
[54:03.85]He needs to cool off.
[54:05.51]You mind telling me what's got him so riled up?
[54:10.67]We've been having problems with the Haitians.
[54:15.49]But like I say, we've got it under control.
[54:17.89]I like important cutscenes.
[54:19.83]We're having a... Yeah.
[54:22.78]That just doesn't work.
[54:26.40]Thanks a lot, Darkbird.
[54:29.18]And thank you, Eliobot.
[54:30.24]Eight months, man.
[54:31.64]My depression is shitty today.
[54:33.44]Thanks a lot for making me smile.
[54:34.87]Was this too serious?
[54:36.41]Dicks out.
[54:36.89]Oh, goodness.
[54:37.23]Hope you have a good rest of your day, Eliobot.
[54:39.79]Nonsense.
[54:51.26]Lincoln needs to get out.
[54:52.98]Enjoy the day.
[54:54.02]The acting's good.
[54:55.18]It's like a good quality cutscenes and acting and everything.
[55:00.04]Gone.
[55:01.24]Those people waiting on their food.
[55:05.97]Oh, I saw Lincoln a couple times once he was first back.
[55:10.33]It's like a documentary.
[55:12.41]He told me he wanted to leave town, head out to California.
[55:18.09]Now, he had a friend in the service who could get him a job working at the Mare Island shipyard.
[55:23.41]And the only reason he came back was to tell Sammy and Ellis goodbye.
[55:27.83]Really great cigarette effects.
[55:30.04]But then he found out about the trouble Sammy was having with those Haitians.
[55:37.04]So he decided to stay and help.
[55:39.96]Cutscenes and story are top-notch.
[55:41.20]Gameplay just sucks balls after all.
[55:42.76]Those Haitians, they are bad news.
[55:49.76]No talking Lankan out of it.
[55:53.39]Whatever else he might have become, Lankan was always loyal.
[55:59.15]Like right there, that like facial animation, that was like just top notch.
[56:04.61]Cheese Fistess, can you pause the game so I can get food?
[56:06.93]You got it.
[56:08.29]Go.
[56:09.89]Go, go, go, go, go.
[56:14.34]I'm paused right now.
[56:16.16]Quick, quick, quick, go, go, go, quick, get the food.
[56:21.24]Okay, here we go.
[56:22.16]Hopefully you guys sprinted and got some graham crackers.
[56:29.45]Alright, do I have to go in here and like... Oh boy, here we go.
[56:31.19]Alright, let's go fight.
[56:32.05]I love details like this.
[56:33.03]I find really, really interesting.
[56:34.73]Like this guy is cooking this burger over here.
[56:50.96]There's people just sitting there eating the food and I like... ...when there's little details in games like that.
[56:58.75]Look at this chopped up carrot.
[56:59.71]See the little carrot right there?
[57:00.67]I don't know if I just dumped it.
[57:07.70]I dropped it.
[57:15.15]Isn't this the guy that I spiked into the ground?
[57:20.09]I'm pretty sure this is the same guy that I spiked into the ground.
[57:22.37]Or is it not?
[57:24.85]Is this a random pedestrian in Mafia 3?
[57:28.64]Like number 200?
[57:29.18]How's your day been?
[57:34.68]You delivering a real blessing here, Lincoln.
[57:37.52]Thank you.
[57:38.69]There you go.
[57:39.29]You're welcome.
[57:42.37]A couple days back and they already got you working?
[57:45.29]I'm happy to do it.
[57:46.19]It means a hell of a lot to all of us.
[57:52.44]Hey, you.
[57:52.92]You too, ma'am.
[57:53.90]Have some.
[57:54.66]Oh, jeez.
[57:58.48]Quality soup!
[58:00.86]This is some riveting volunteer at the local soup kitchen gameplay.
[58:05.48]Oh, what was that?
[58:09.28]Okay, out there.
[58:10.04]Here, let go.
[58:11.88]I can't.
[58:12.18]Give me a baseball bat.
[58:13.02]I can't.
[58:13.28]We just tossed Wayne.
[58:20.81]Can I serve him soup?
[58:23.14]Jeez!
[58:23.84]Oh my god!
[58:25.62]I knew I was gonna throw it at somebody.
[58:29.01]Oh!
[58:30.13]My god!
[58:34.89]Man, these are... I love the melee in this game.
[58:37.94]When you do, like, those, like, final, like, ending... Ugh, they're so crazy.
[58:44.86]I just threw hot soup on that guy.
[58:53.87]wrong guy it was like somebody in the line oh my god that would be so horrible oh hey we're back back to the documentary elected president of Haiti in 1957. by 1959 he had created a secret police called tantan makut and people started to flee
[59:10.18]No, this is not right at all.
[59:11.67]Okay, now I get it.
[59:13.17]Now I get it.
[59:13.99]Good, hard-working people were hardened criminals.
[59:17.09]They formed the backbone of what became the Haitian gang.
[59:20.18]Lincoln found out they set up in the swamps and were led by a man named Baca.
[59:27.89]So I gotta go get him?
[59:31.51]He pulls out, like, the papers and just goes like, no, wait a minute, this is impossible.
[59:36.09]That guy drove off a fucking cliff?
[59:38.43]No, that's not what happened.
[59:47.44]It always feels weird when they use real pictures in games.
[59:50.94]Yeah, well, it adds a little bit of realism to it.
[59:54.18]Didn't take long for us to figure out it was the Haitians.
[59:57.92]Alright, let's get in the car again.
[59:59.84]This thing with the Haitians...
[60:28.64]It's time for it to end.
[60:30.02]What's he drinking?
[60:30.52]Didn't even show the label.
[60:32.37]I want to know what it is.
[60:33.69]You and Ellis need to handle it.
[60:35.09]How are we going to find him?
[60:38.51]Back in the 20s, folks used to pull salt out of the bayou.
[60:43.85]Is there any multiplayer in this game or is it just single player?
[60:47.62]When the Depression hit, they abandoned it.
[60:49.24]That's the only place this could have come from.
[60:51.92]We're going to need guns and ammo.
[60:55.30]Call this number.
[60:57.86]There's a lot of space mustard.
[61:00.08]Thanks for your subscription.
[61:01.28]Welcome to.
[61:02.18]And then welcome to not bird as well.
[61:04.00]Not a bird.
[61:06.80]No sense tipping anybody off.
[61:10.22]Or we can sweep the hollow, track down and kill every last one of those cocksuckers.
[61:15.29]Then we wouldn't have to worry about it.
[61:16.59]The last thing folks in this neighborhood need to see is colored people killing each other.
[61:22.91]Do this quiet.
[61:25.03]Away from here.
[61:27.53]Once we eliminate whoever's running the show, the rest of them will go down on their own.
[61:32.55]Trust me.
[61:32.92]Alright, soldier boy.
[61:36.22]I'll follow your lead.
[61:36.90]Let's do it.
[61:38.08]I'm ready.
[61:38.52]Be careful here.
[61:40.84]Those Haitians are hard people.
[61:43.17]Please tell me I get melee weapons.
[61:46.85]I would play this whole game with like a baseball bat.
[61:49.41]Or like a hatchet or something.
[61:55.76]Let's do it.
[62:02.44]Oh, I gotta talk about this.
[62:03.98]Yeah, let's talk about this.
[62:04.96]I'm gonna pause the game.
[62:08.35]Apparently...
[62:10.80]We're in a boat?
[62:12.30]Hold on.
[62:12.62]Alright.
[62:13.16]Apparently, so my internet, the problem has apparently been solved.
[62:19.32]I guess they found what was happening.
[62:22.28]Somebody on my street was crashing the whole node somehow with either their faulty wires or their modem was like all screwed up sending like leaking signal.
[62:36.72]So I guess they found whoever that was and like patched it up so that it should not happen ever again.
[62:43.73]So Lorag is finally gone.
[62:46.74]He's finally away from the stream forever.
[62:48.24]At least I hope he is.
[62:50.20]And I'm going to say that right now and boom, the stream is going to go down.
[62:54.48]With like my luck.
[62:57.47]But it should not happen ever again.
[63:04.10]Free of the Comcast God.
[63:05.84]Yeah, we sucked it out of our soul.
[63:07.63]Alright, let's do this.
[63:09.51]Never going to be over.
[63:10.19]Story mission unlocked.
[63:10.97]Let's go.
[63:11.19]Stop streaming for eight months?
[63:12.71]Oh, no way.
[63:12.91]Apologize to Comcast.
[63:30.31]Swim to the dock?
[63:31.25]It's right there.
[63:31.83]You can't drive to it?
[63:33.45]Are you kidding me?
[63:34.01]I just, like, sunk.
[63:39.34]Uh-oh.
[63:39.94]No, no, no.
[63:40.66]Don't do this to me right now.
[63:42.88]Do not do this to me right now.
[63:47.08]20 boat rate.
[63:52.68]Okay.
[63:53.82]Let me make sure that doesn't happen again.
[63:55.96]It didn't.
[63:58.96]What are you doing?
[64:02.88]You serious?
[64:04.34]How did you both not see each other?
[64:08.36]You fucking idiots.
[64:15.14]What is this person doing?
[64:21.86]Well, have a nice day, ma'am.
[64:27.56]There she goes.

[71:59.53]Shotgun time.
[72:06.39]Uh, how many guys are over there?
[72:12.16]Oh, I gotta go through the house.
[72:14.56]Is it a V8 powered gator?
[72:16.12]Seriously, I don't know.
[72:18.94]I'm gonna put that away for now.
[72:23.31]We got two guys, right?
[72:31.58]Huh?
[72:31.90]Whose footprints are these?
[72:34.65]What was that noise?
[72:38.79]Whoa.
[72:39.85]How did that guy not see that?
[72:42.25]I have no idea.
[72:49.79]Get this guy too.
[72:52.38]Whistling.
[72:52.80]Yeah, I just whistled.
[72:54.40]You don't have to tell me again.
[72:59.50]This guy's got a shotgun.
[73:00.62]Okay.
[73:00.72]Man, that's so... That crow hop punch.
[73:10.24]I don't think we'll ever get old.
[73:19.98]Alright, we gotta find the guy.
[73:21.08]Anybody over there?
[73:24.37]One?
[73:25.19]Two guys?
[73:26.75]Two guys?
[73:29.08]We got it.
[73:30.54]Let's sneak.
[73:33.88]Do I have any grenades?
[73:43.81]Wait for this guy.
[73:44.85]Don't stick out too far.
[73:46.25]Hopefully he doesn't see me.
[73:50.31]In here.
[73:50.69]There's another guy too, I think.
[73:58.45]Shit.
[73:59.17]Shit!
[74:07.55]Too fast for ya!
[74:13.15]What?
[74:14.09]I don't... Let's sneak... Just cause it's a grenade doesn't mean it can't be a sneaky grenade.
[74:19.14]Ooyoyoyoyoyoy!
[74:32.42]That doesn't work anymore, apparently.
[74:35.50]We're gonna have to shoot this guy.
[74:36.48]Alright, got him once.
[74:41.65]Gotta get him in the head.
[74:42.51]Did he say gotta heal?
[74:48.19]Shit.
[74:49.47]Who else is shooting at me?
[74:56.34]Who the hell is shooting that gun?
[75:02.17]Where is this guy?
[75:04.89]Am I out of my mind or does this guy not exist?
[75:06.45]Sprinting!
[75:11.42]In here!
[75:12.94]DOI!
[75:37.13]I'm sure he's coming in straight.
[75:38.13]Surprise!
[75:42.15]He just tried to get me.
[75:43.25]Alright, got him.
[75:45.67]One more guy.
[76:06.21]Don't know where the... Where the hell is this last guy?
[76:14.09]Is he... Are they not shooting at me?
[76:15.31]Are they shooting at somebody else?
[76:16.29]Is there another guy sneaking in here?
[76:17.44]Oh, he's right there.
[76:34.23]He keeps killing us.
[76:43.53]I love how that's like something they yell.
[76:45.23]Holy shit, guys, he keeps killing us!
[76:53.33]Get in the house!
[76:56.33]Give me that health.
[77:11.00]Nice and sneaky, just the way you like it.
[77:15.63]That guy's got a machine gun.
[77:16.37]Okay, one, two, go.
[77:25.81]Reloading.
[77:29.44]Right in the kidney.
[77:30.62]And he's done.
[77:32.16]See you later.
[77:33.50]I'll take that Tommy gun, whatever it is.
[77:35.02]Ooh!
[77:51.20]Quick, open up the cabinet!
[77:52.64]Is that guy alive?
[77:53.30]This guy is alive.
[78:19.03]I have to reload!
[78:20.79]I have to reload!
[78:26.97]I win!
[78:27.39]I won!
[78:31.45]You're gonna answer for your crimes!
[78:38.44]Fuck you!
[78:39.84]Who've I known better?! !
[78:44.03]Sneak master.
[78:44.67]Thanks a lot, Custy.
[78:46.77]Welcome back for six months.
[78:49.33]And thanks a lot to Fox881.
[78:51.87]Thanks for seven months, dude.
[78:53.86]Wow, that was brutal.
[79:11.40]I just, like, cracked his neck.
[79:14.64]Oh, did I just do that in front of this kid?
[79:15.94]Oh, that's not good.
[79:16.84]Oh, boy.
[79:17.30]Oh, no, it's not good.
[79:19.78]It's not good.
[79:21.48]You fucking pig!
[79:23.43]Damn you to hell!
[79:25.13]Take it easy!
[79:26.71]Take it easy?
[79:28.55]Take it easy?
[79:30.39]He kept me in there.
[79:31.85]Locked in there.
[79:32.99]Day and night.
[79:34.41]Bees me.
[79:35.77]Use me.
[79:37.85]I kiss you, motherfucker!
[79:44.82]this is intense oh no
[80:15.18]Oh, I got grenades.
[80:17.50]Did I get a grenade?
[80:21.46]Who's fighting who?
[80:24.01]Who's shooting who?
[80:24.79]No, don't whistle.
[80:27.77]Okay, that's what I wanted.
[80:29.03]I wanted those molotovs and grenades, exactly.
[80:32.95]Throw, hold, release, cancel.
[80:40.05]I don't even know where that went.
[80:45.83]Hey guys, here comes a grenade.
[80:47.77]Be careful with these.
[80:52.59]Hmm, alright.
[80:53.35]Guy right there.
[80:54.05]They're both throwing fire bombs.
[81:03.32]I don't think I have any left.
[81:06.88]There's so many people here right now.
[81:18.35]Who is it?
[81:20.81]Can I shoot it?
[81:21.33]Oh, I blew it up in his hands.
[81:22.10]What do we got?
[81:26.46]This guy?
[81:27.76]Alright, that should be it, alright?
[81:32.74]Get a better view.
[81:35.94]I'll be safe behind this wooden fence.
[81:43.80]Ooh, that's... That's rain, okay.
[81:47.41]What's going on with this guy?
[81:49.96]This guy's not dead.
[81:53.62]No, I wanted to pick up the other guy.
[82:00.42]Do I do something about this?
[82:02.05]Oh, he's dead.
[82:04.33]Never mind.
[82:05.35]He died.
[82:09.25]Give me the machine gun.
[82:10.29]I'll try it out.
[82:18.51]Can I get in this car?
[82:21.07]Can I get in this toy car?
[82:22.23]I would love to.
[82:22.87]Any more of those Molotovs?
[82:28.71]Did I miss one?
[82:29.35]Probably.
[82:29.69]I'm going over here.
[82:34.83]Sneak around the right.
[82:42.14]Yeah.
[82:43.18]What's going on, Green Going Ranger?
[82:48.54]Thanks for the sub.
[82:49.48]Appreciate it.
[83:01.08]I really need that health.
[83:02.56]Oh, easy, easy, easy.
[83:07.54]Okay, I'm fine.
[83:09.44]I've done so many knee-jerk reactions, it's not even funny in this game so far.
[83:15.01]Bullets in this?
[83:27.16]I'm scared to go any further.
[83:32.73]Open up the box.
[83:33.68]Open it, open it, open it.
[83:36.80]Yeah, come check in here.
[83:43.54]DDT him.
[83:44.06]DDT him.
[83:44.50]Come on.
[83:47.04]No DDT.
[83:48.28]We didn't get the DDT, guys.
[83:52.18]Use an adrenaline shot to restore yourself to full health.
[83:56.55]Okay, so it's... Oh, cool.
[84:03.74]I want to fully sprint and spear this guy.
[84:11.43]That didn't work, but it's okay.
[84:14.01]It's okay.
[84:14.57]It's a long escape, isn't it?
[84:26.43]He's got no ammo.
[84:27.31]Okay, never mind.
[84:28.05]Neither does that.
[84:30.13]Neither does that gun.
[84:31.33]None of my guns have ammo, apparently.
[84:32.77]So we're going to have to go back to the punching technique.
[84:35.68]Give me your weapon.
[84:39.98]No!
[84:40.26]That probably hurt more than the bullet.
[84:58.76]Oh, shit in my pants!
[85:15.85]Why am I shooting in the air?
[85:16.97]Stop shooting in the air!
[85:18.59]Oh my god.
[85:24.19]No way!
[85:27.07]I'm invincible during the cutscene, right?
[85:34.96]Heal!
[85:35.72]Heal!
[85:36.10]Heal!
[85:36.62]Heal!
[85:36.97]Heal!
[85:39.17]Okay, we're good.
[85:39.75]We're good.
[85:40.71]We're good.
[85:41.83]We're good.
[85:42.17]We're good.
[85:42.49]We're good.
[85:43.25]We're good.
[85:43.75]We're good.
[85:44.23]We're good.
[85:45.47]We're good.
[85:58.20]Give me that adrenaline.
[86:05.07]Is he here?
[86:11.75]Don't shoot him.
[86:14.71]Why did you get out of the car?
[86:16.21]The car seemed like the safest place to be.
[86:19.59]I'm gonna get up and just walk.
[86:20.53]Alright, let's do it.
[86:24.37]Come on, Ellis.
[86:26.26]Let's get the hell out of here.
[86:32.55]Do not crash this car.
[86:33.85]That was a long mission.
[86:40.67]Just my luck I'm going to do something really fucking dumb.
[86:42.87]And I'm going to flip the car.
[86:45.55]It's raining out and shit.
[86:46.77]Something exploded in the back.
[86:47.93]Something exploded.
[86:52.72]The car is exploding.
[86:53.68]Explosions.
[86:54.18]There's a long ways away.
[86:55.22]Oh.
[87:22.66]Is this a jump?
[87:24.02]I thought that was a huge jump.
[87:26.74]I was about to freak the hell out.
[87:32.33]Don't flip the car.
[87:33.21]Don't flip the car.
[87:33.97]Don't go in the ocean.
[87:34.93]Don't go in the ocean.
[87:41.31]God, that back explosion thing is really causing me eye strain.
[87:49.18]Easy.
[87:51.31]No reason to freak the hell out, just go straight.
[87:59.67]Guys, word of advice, don't ever go 105 miles per hour during rain in, like, suburban streets.
[88:07.36]What does B do?
[88:10.40]B doesn't do anything.
[88:14.16]Yeah, B doesn't do anything.
[88:16.16]B doesn't do anything?
[88:24.39]Not even one point of damage on that car.
[88:25.85]Do you see that?
[88:26.27]Remember, press B to flip.
[88:39.56]That's a pretty sunset.
[88:42.00]Sunrise.
[88:42.54]What time is it?
[88:43.12]I don't know.
[88:49.36]Can we just go in here?
[88:55.98]No, okay.
[88:58.34]Hello!
[89:03.39]Get back here.
[89:04.29]You want me to drive the car into your garage?
[89:06.49]I can do that.
[89:22.73]Feeling out.
[89:26.25]Okay, the car just turned off for me.
[89:33.08]Thank you, the internet hero for 190 Bits.
[89:36.96]Welcome, dude.
[89:37.60]Thanks for that.
[89:41.60]Now, if there wasn't someone going after Sammy, then there was someone else forcing him into a bad situation.
[89:49.53]It was never going to end.
[89:56.92]That's how a man can end up working for Sal Marcano.
[90:00.94]You were right about those Haitians being down by that old salt mine.
[90:04.72]It won't be bothering us again.
[90:07.69]Sal Marcano's gonna come in and pet you now.
[90:10.41]This isn't any different than what I was doing before I left.
[90:15.39]You probably don't know this.
[90:18.54]But every night on the TV, right after the news, they show the names of all the boys killed over there.
[90:25.58]Does Jeremy know there's a choice amount of boobs in the Mafia series?
[90:28.45]Well, I'm going to have to avoid those areas.
[90:31.61]Watching that list scroll by, wondering if today is the day.
[90:34.11]I don't want to get my stream banned.
[90:35.85]I finally see your name.
[90:37.79]But you never did.
[90:40.35]Nothing happened to me.
[90:41.43]There's only so much luck down the well.
[90:45.57]Sooner or later...
[90:51.01]Somebody asked how I like it so far.
[90:53.40]From what I've been able to play.
[90:56.78]It seems pretty fun.
[90:58.36]It's got that kind of GTA feel to it.
[91:01.76]It's very cutscene heavy so far though.
[91:03.82]But somebody said after the first few hours it kind of goes away.
[91:06.73]Says he's got something in the works.
[91:17.18]Just square things up between us.
[91:18.52]Feeding people to alligators is alright.
[91:20.95]They may not like it, but they're not going to say no to Sal Marcano.
[91:27.21]He says you get to come in, you get to come in.
[91:31.41]Fine.
[91:32.57]Always did want to see the inside of that place.
[91:36.92]Go get the Playboy magazines.
[91:38.96]Yeah?
[91:40.02]No, I'm not picking up any Playboy magazines.
[91:42.08]Yes, sir.
[91:58.48]Time to make a change.
[92:00.12]Alright.
[92:00.44]Do I have a... Have I opened up the world yet at this point?
[92:11.29]Don't worry.
[92:13.69]You can be safe knowing that I, protector of the citizens... I love the... Can I get in the phone booth?
[92:24.04]Well, you can actually get inside the phone booth.
[92:27.08]Ten out of ten.
[92:30.50]Some games, they have these things here like phone booths and little benches, but you can't interact.
[92:35.18]You can go inside.
[92:37.55]Ten fucking points.
[92:42.37]How you doing?
[92:43.29]How you doing?
[92:44.43]How you doing?
[92:44.91]How you doing?
[92:46.77]Can I read a book?
[92:47.33]Can I read the book too?
[92:53.27]What does it say?
[92:55.20]Can't read it.
[92:57.67]The game looks good from what I can play.
[93:06.28]Let's just steal a car.
[93:10.14]I went like, oh.
[93:13.76]Where did I drive?
[93:15.14]Yeah, you're going to be late.
[93:17.38]You're going to be more than late.
[93:18.34]What are you going to say now, huh?
[93:21.89]What are you going to say now?
[93:32.92]I guess I can't do anything here.
[93:36.44]Twitch said it's okay to look at the Playboy as long as you don't do it for long.
[93:43.58]Simulated driving.
[93:46.07]Don't think I want to turn that on.
[93:52.95]Was that guy about to, like, come steal the car?
[93:55.53]He was, like, coming, like, he looked like he was driving, like, getting too close to me.
[94:03.37]I'm going to have to turn down some options here because it is frame ready, especially during the day.
[94:12.05]It's already on like low geometry detail.
[94:16.75]What can I turn off here that won't make it look terrible?
[94:31.55]Turn on simulated driving.
[94:33.17]Maybe I'll bring this down to low for shadows.
[94:39.33]V-Sync is off.
[94:42.74]I'll bring shadow to low.
[94:45.92]Ambient occlusion.
[94:47.04]Turn it off.
[94:48.44]I can't.
[94:48.98]I can only put it on low.
[94:54.06]Turning off AA helps.
[94:55.72]I'll put AA down to medium.
[94:59.82]See if that helps at all.
[95:02.18]That feels a lot better already, just from coming back into the menu.
[95:04.84]Oh, hold on.
[95:05.48]Let me get my game back.
[95:11.35]Put the resolution at 800x600.
[95:13.35]Yeah, I'm already on the 60 cap.
[95:18.65]I don't have it on unlimited right now.
[95:19.79]It's only on 60.
[95:20.31]It definitely already feels like it's running at least twice as the frame rate that it was before.
[95:28.31]I heard this game is very poorly optimized, so... I'm still probably gonna have frame problems, considering I have a 780.
[95:33.08]Because I'm a piece of shit.
[95:36.42]You know, I'm a piece of absolute dog fucking shit.
[95:38.42]I have a 780.
[95:38.64]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[95:39.58]I'm going the wrong way.
[95:40.46]Mmmmm. Ah!
[95:56.41]Sim- Alright, I'm gonna turn on simulated driving.
[95:59.79]What do I do it?
[96:03.53]Assets?
[96:03.95]I don't even know how to do it.
[96:06.60]I don't even- I don't know.
[96:13.56]What are you, a caveman? 780!
[96:22.82]$7,000 on a joke, but still has a 780.
[96:24.92]I know.
[96:25.14]What's wrong with my car?
[96:30.51]My car's making all kinds of weird noises.
[96:37.41]Oh, no.
[96:37.83]I bypassed the point and no return.
[96:45.98]We're good.
[96:47.86]We're okay.
[96:56.05]Options, of course.
[96:57.05]Well, I don't want to simulate the driving.
[96:58.59]I want to drive.
[96:59.25]This is so far away.
[97:13.64]This way or up on the highway?
[97:16.14]No, up on the highway.
[97:16.96]I can ship you a 1070.
[97:23.28]Like, fuck, you need to upgrade.
[97:26.77]No, it's alright.
[97:29.73]I'm probably, I'm gonna get a new computer here in like a few months probably.
[97:37.89]What the hell?
[97:41.07]What the fuck is this game talking about?
[97:42.91]Didn't it just tell me to go up this way instead of down the way I was going?
[97:45.68]I ain't listening to this shit.
[97:49.50]GPS is always wrong.
[97:50.60]I know the way.
[97:51.16]I know these like streets.
[97:52.60]Don't I?
[98:02.01]You need to ask for directions, honey.
[98:05.38]We're about to be past the point of no return again.
[98:07.36]Hold on, this is a... Okay, I'm on the wrong side of the road.
[98:11.20]This is a one-way.
[98:14.86]Cars aren't supposed to be coming down this way.
[98:17.07]Now I understand.
[98:17.81]Yeah, the GPS is always wrong.
[98:19.31]If you want to go faster and get there in a timely manner, just go on the one-way street.
[98:26.97]Like, for instance... Oh, I thought that was going to come down and crush these people.
[98:35.74]No, shit.
[98:39.20]I'm going this way.
[98:40.10]I'm using my gamer skill to get there.
[98:46.71]Taking a right here.
[98:47.55]See, I know the way to get there.
[98:48.75]I don't need some GPS to tell me where to go.
[98:50.63]Alright, the joke there was it was supposed to explode.
[99:00.84]Like, haha, he drove into the gas station.
[99:04.30]But that didn't work.
[99:08.60]Haha, he drove into the gas station and it exploded.
[99:10.79]That didn't work.
[99:12.15]I'm going all the way out of fucking nowhere.
[99:15.91]This is not the right way.
[99:19.17]Not even close.
[99:20.11]Oh, wait, hold on a second.
[99:21.29]Did the GPS just update?
[99:22.71]Are you going the right way?
[99:24.29]You guys can't say I'm going the wrong way now.
[99:29.21]I'm going the right way now.
[99:30.43]I'm going the correct way.
[99:32.86]Get out of my way.
[99:34.56]I'm going the right way.
[99:39.05]And we'll take a quick little shortcut through the shrubbery over here.
[99:45.11]These sounds.
[99:49.31]Quick little shortcut through the shrubbery.
[99:53.46]Oh, it's a bumpy ride to Grandma's house.
[100:06.93]Well, we're not on a road anymore, but we'll get there eventually.
[100:16.81]Hey, you guys wanted me to go the right way.
[100:21.87]You guys wanted me to go the correct way.
[100:24.38]Press B. Press B. Oh, yes, it worked.
[100:37.65]Drive through?
[100:40.34]These are just bushes.
[100:41.30]I can't drive through the bushes.
[100:43.50]There's gotta be like a hidden way for me to get in there.
[100:48.30]Concrete shrubbery.
[100:52.46]What the hell?
[100:55.34]I'm on some... I'm in some state park.
[100:59.92]Where is it telling me to go?
[101:01.12]What the fuck?
[101:05.49]No, no, no.
[101:06.01]I'm going this way.
[101:07.87]Why is it doing this?
[101:09.63]Are you kidding me right now?
[101:14.24]It wants me to go all the way around.
[101:16.32]When I could just go over this way.
[101:17.84]I was going the right way.
[101:21.08]But thanks a lot, Thrummond.
[101:23.10]Thrummond, thanks for six months.
[101:28.61]Nice shortcut.
[101:29.35]Yeah, this is a shortcut, man.
[101:30.63]He did his shortcut strategies on this stream.
[101:34.65]I don't know if you watch other streams.
[101:47.70]You rusty old bag of shit!
[101:53.39]Now I can't press shift anymore.
[101:59.95]We're okay.
[102:01.55]We're okay.
[102:02.53]Don't worry.
[102:03.03]Run saved.
[102:06.87]Run saved.
[102:07.43]Don't worry, guys.
[102:10.47]We're fine.
[102:15.69]Sorry.
[102:16.59]Sorry, guys.
[102:17.23]I had to take your truck.
[102:23.45]You might see other streams where they go the right way, but we go the shortcut way.
[102:30.26]It's this way.
[102:32.85]Mouse?
[102:33.53]Oh, the mouse is back.
[102:34.55]Alright, after I get out, I'll change it.
[102:36.27]I thought that was a gun.
[102:41.23]It was an arrow pointing right.
[102:47.35]See?
[102:49.13]Just in time.
[102:50.95]Just in time to take out the guy at the yacht club.
[103:02.92]There we are.
[103:03.54]This is so much longer if we would have gone the wrong way.
[103:09.00]Yep, I'm here to see the president!
[103:16.67]Can you open up the door, please?
[103:22.72]What?
[103:22.98]Open the door!
[103:26.95]He's serious.
[103:27.95]I'm here to see the guy.
[103:29.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:30.97]Park over to the side?
[103:32.70]You can go fuck yourself.
[103:34.64]You park that car for me, dickhead.
[104:04.34]Alright, there we go.
[104:07.48]Lincoln Clay!
[104:08.86]Christ, man, get a look at ya!
[104:10.98]I bet those fuckin' gooks shit themselves when they saw you comin'.
[104:14.19]Been a long time, Georgie.
[104:15.77]Oh, no shit has been a long time.
[104:17.53]I think the last time I saw you was that night over in the French Ward, right before you shipped out.
[104:23.32]Am I going to stream the Dark Souls 3 DLC?
[104:24.50]Probably.
[104:24.74]I would assume so.
[104:25.46]So is there any connection at all to the second game at all?
[104:28.50]Or is this just completely new storyline?
[104:30.54]Oh, that's a guy from the beginning of the game.
[104:51.99]Oh, dude, I wish I could just punch out that guy right in the face.
[104:56.82]Please tell me I can spike one of these guys' heads into the ground.
[105:01.84]I should have wore something else.
[105:03.97]Hey, these squares have a problem with your threads.
[105:06.63]Take it up with my old man.
[105:07.81]He'll tell him to kiss his ass.
[105:10.87]Nice thing about having fuck you money.
[105:14.69]Olivia, I hate to cut this short, darling, but I've got a meeting coming up.
[105:17.92]Remy, a pleasure as always.
[105:19.34]So this is Saul Marconi?
[105:21.58]Marcano?
[105:24.76]Lincoln.
[105:26.40]Good to see you.
[105:27.78]This is Vito Scaletta.
[105:29.92]He's the one I've been telling you about.
[105:33.88]That was a real firm handshake.
[105:35.00]I like that handshake.
[105:37.73]So you served in Vietnam, huh?
[105:39.23]Yes, sir.
[105:40.61]Sal tells me you're under a few pieces of tin over there.
[105:43.71]This is Vito from Mafia 2.
[106:13.91]Okay.
[106:14.01]Okay.
[106:14.13]This is my, like, mission guy.
[106:19.08]I'm gonna sue him.
[106:19.78]Yeah, Sammy didn't tell me too much.
[106:38.70]Twice a year, the Feds take old money out of circulation and destroy it.
[106:42.42]Just graphics are crazy.
[106:43.24]Like, just the facial animations are crazy.
[106:45.45]That money's gonna be delivered here to the reserve in town.
[106:49.35]And you're gonna hit one of those shipments?
[106:51.99]No, sir.
[106:53.11]We are gonna use that occasion to gain access to their vault.
[106:56.51]And then steal everything that ain't nailed down.
[106:59.19]Should be six, seven million in there.
[107:01.21]Easy.
[107:03.46]It's pretty fucking ballsy.
[107:04.82]It's like uncanny.
[107:05.58]It reminds me of L.A.
[107:06.80]Noire.
[107:07.00]Oh, well, you will.
[107:08.12]We brought him and his old man in on this.
[107:10.14]And they're going to need your help, so go see them.
[107:12.08]They're still in that same place.
[107:23.11]What's the studio that made this game?
[107:24.35]What's the actual 2K studio?
[107:26.25]It's safe to assume you know about the problems Sammy's been having.
[107:29.51]I took care of the Haitians.
[107:30.69]Once things settle down, money will start coming in again.
[107:33.13]You see that right there?
[107:33.85]That's what I'm talking about.
[107:35.19]You didn't sit around with your thumb jammed in your ass.
[107:37.29]You saw a problem, you went out and took care of it.
[107:39.43]Goddamn, I take that over money any day of the week.
[107:42.14]We pay our own way.
[107:43.16]That's an all.
[107:43.84]Always have.
[107:45.12]Hell, son, I know that.
[107:47.12]I wouldn't expect otherwise.
[107:49.28]But you know, even after we all evened up, you're still gonna be slopping around in the ass end of this city.
[107:55.34]Not much of a future in that.
[107:57.84]But maybe there's a different way forward, you understand?
[108:01.18]For all of us.
[108:02.98]Would you have a mind?
[108:08.20]I want you to know I mean... Sonic Team.
[108:10.74]Oh yeah, Sonic Team made this.
[108:12.04]Sammy's a hell of a man.
[108:14.14]But he's not getting any younger.
[108:16.70]And I'm thinking it's time to make a change.
[108:19.79]Well, I don't think that Ellis is ready for that kind of stuff.
[108:22.02]I'm not talking about Ellis.
[108:23.86]I'm talking about you.
[108:25.20]I want you to run the holler.
[108:27.84]Oh, he's giving me some... I can't do that.
[108:30.20]He's giving me some leadership skills things.
[108:31.82]Well, yeah, if you're worried about Sammy, don't you understand?
[108:34.86]He's always been on the level with me.
[108:36.97]And this job we're talking about, there's more than enough for him to retire on.
[108:41.24]Took me in when I had nowhere else to go.
[108:44.16]Treated me like a son.
[108:45.75]Oh, sorry.
[108:46.27]Bumped the mic.
[108:47.05]Thanks a lot, Paul Waffle.
[108:49.03]For eight months.
[108:49.65]Welcome back, dude.
[108:50.85]The Waffle.
[108:52.09]Well, shit, son.
[108:54.79]I'd be lying if I didn't say I wasn't just a little disappointed.
[109:00.45]But I get it.
[109:01.89]You're loyal.
[109:06.06]How long is the game?
[109:07.68]What's, like, the actual length of the game?
[109:09.12]Like, if you remove the cutscenes.
[109:10.85]Oh, Jesus.
[109:11.05]Yeah, they, like, just throw in those random real-life images.
[109:34.88]during his time in Vietnam.
[109:36.86]Someone like that, you don't need to train.
[109:38.40]You point them in the right direction, you get the fuck out of their way.
[109:42.30]They're throwing in those, like, images.
[109:44.70]Those real images.
[109:48.88]Took me about 20 hours.
[109:54.49]Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[109:55.51]Wait, we're back in the beginning of the game.
[109:59.67]Oh, this is... Okay, I get it.
[110:01.03]I get it.
[110:01.33]Cool, cool, cool.
[110:01.89]Let's go.
[110:02.21]We'll get through this.
[110:07.82]Intel view.
[110:09.06]Oh, now you lost me.
[110:11.44]Now you lost me.
[110:14.69]Now you lost me.
[110:18.01]Oh, come on.
[110:18.97]Now you lost me.
[110:20.65]You had me and you fucking lost me with like the Intel VR view.
[110:27.10]Hold on.
[110:30.58]Give me a second.
[110:31.12]I need to get this mouse off the screen.
[110:37.76]Just don't use it.
[110:44.45]Immersion broken.
[110:46.11]Alright, mouse gone.
[110:47.36]Mouse gone.
[110:51.72]That muzzle flash is kind of giving me a headache.
[110:54.43]I'm not gonna lie.
[111:04.27]Okay, that... Okay.
[111:05.53]Okay.
[111:05.97]My goodness.
[111:06.45]That was not... That was very unintentional.
[111:09.99]I'm sorry that you... It's not... No, get... Stop it!
[111:15.97]Get away from him!
[111:16.67]I'm gonna go, like, over here.
[111:17.63]Somebody down there?
[111:22.41]Ah!
[111:34.07]Oh, don't worry.
[111:34.45]Don't worry.
[111:34.75]They killed the lights.
[111:35.27]Don't worry.
[111:35.53]I have Intel view.
[111:37.95]It's Intel inside.
[111:39.99]I've got a 4770K in this brain of mine.
[111:45.92]Defend him?
[111:46.36]Why am I defending him?
[111:50.36]What's going on?
[111:52.32]Oh, great.
[111:54.10]Okay.
[111:54.80]Now we're going to do some lights out.
[111:57.34]Lights out gameplay.
[111:58.47]You know what I mean?
[112:01.55]Hello, goodnight.
[112:02.71]That was not quiet, but got the job done.
[112:06.27]Got the job done.
[112:06.85]Well, we're here.
[112:32.22]Kinda running like a, this guy's walking like a dickhead.
[112:44.02]I'm here, come over here.
[112:46.98]Sense danger.
[112:50.60]Sense danger.
[112:52.88]I am the danger.
[112:55.10]I am the one who knocks Jesse.
[112:58.24]Jesse!
[112:59.54]No, that's not fucking... That wasn't even funny.
[113:02.05]That wasn't even funny.
[113:03.01]And I, like, I got myself killed.
[113:09.11]That was a terrible joke.
[113:10.19]It wasn't even fucking close to being funny.
[113:12.66]And I almost died for it.
[113:13.56]We're good?
[113:20.10]We're good?
[113:21.42]Good?
[113:22.92]Good?
[113:25.45]Swapping cover.
[113:27.65]I think I already know how to do that.
[113:28.91]Wait.
[113:29.03]I'm in big trouble.
[113:29.61]That was not left off.
[113:30.47]I pressed the Windows key.
[113:57.12]Oh, I actually got him!
[114:08.10]Why is he giving me tutorials here?
[114:09.56]Alright, it's time just to light this place up like the fucking 4th of July.
[114:28.06]He was here last night too, wasn't ya?
[114:31.40]He was here.
[114:31.94]And he was smooching with my brother.
[114:34.62]Fuck.
[114:34.72]Uh-uh.
[115:03.13]I'm using that strategy.
[115:04.21]No more fucking stealth mode.
[115:12.25]Let's just take them all out.
[115:21.40]What?
[115:22.62]What?
[115:22.96]I just got bit by a mosquito and died.
[115:27.22]He didn't even shoot me.
[115:28.10]He didn't even shoot me.
[115:33.81]My character just forgot he was dead and died right there.
[115:35.99]Alright, fuck.
[115:42.25]Okay.
[115:48.46]No way.
[115:50.16]Fuck, I'm serious.
[115:51.48]I can't stop scrolling around.
[115:52.74]I'm...
[115:58.02]Just kill me.
[115:58.68]Kill me so I can fucking restart this dumb shit, please.
[116:02.00]Like, when I want them to kill me, I don't die.
[116:06.86]Time serpent.
[116:09.60]Alright, here we go.
[116:11.34]This is the mo- No, I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna hang out.
[116:24.60]Okay, you're all in big trouble.
[116:34.31]They're getting so close.
[116:36.81]How do you miss with a machine gun this big?
[116:39.40]I'm, like, already dead.
[116:45.00]This thing is so inaccurate that, like, I have to, like, hold the button down on somebody.
[116:48.72]Give me the pistol.
[116:50.03]It was, like, better.
[116:52.81]Just shoot them one time with the pistol.
[117:01.15]Whistle.
[117:02.74]Whistle.
[117:03.18]I don't know how to whistle, guys.
[117:08.83]They don't have grenades, do they?
[117:13.54]Hope not.
[117:15.94]Didn't hit him.
[117:18.32]This guy magically didn't get hit.
[117:26.65]God damn it, I'm shot!
[117:30.27]Do I have any grenades?
[117:37.45]No.
[117:46.07]Give me that health.
[117:47.47]I only have a second here.
[117:54.97]Open it.
[117:55.23]Alright.
[118:00.05]I think we did it.
[118:01.45]You and me.
[118:03.45]You and I. How'd they get us out of here?
[118:04.66]Guy stuck in the ground.
[118:22.21]Omega Suspect, thanks for your subscription, dude.
[118:26.99]I don't need aim assist.
[118:28.28]I don't.
[118:28.58]Is that guys blowing it up?
[118:35.48]Somehow I feel like that would have killed both of us.
[118:37.36]Okay, maybe I think it is going to kill both of us.
[118:43.06]What the hell just happened?
[118:45.82]Turn on simulated shooting.
[118:48.58]It plays the game for you.
[118:52.27]That's kind of cool.
[118:52.79]Look at all this money.
[118:59.47]How come I can't pick it up?
[119:06.32]No one really knows why Sal Marcano turned on Thomas Burke, but he took a point he'd done from him and gave it to an enforcer named Roman the Butcher Barbieri, who promptly busted up one of Burke's legs.
[119:19.69]Now, Danny Burke was part of the heist crew.
[119:23.63]Is it going to be like a Kaiser Soze situation?
[119:32.06]Like, am I sitting in the chair at the end and I'm like, yeah, yeah, I know, that guy was a criminal.
[119:37.92]And then I walk away at the end of the movie.
[119:39.58]This is so loud, I'm really sorry.
[119:41.10]This isn't even turned down though.
[119:52.34]Excuse me.
[119:52.84]Shit!
[120:12.91]Yeah, unfortunately.
[120:14.25]Come on, let's grab a beer.
[120:15.85]Something very uncanny, but yeah, I'm telling you, it's like they're using the same facial animation software or whatever that the L.A.
[120:24.10]Noire guys did.
[120:25.02]All the girls gonna be there and everything, except we just gotta go in my car.
[120:28.28]That's a pretty nice spin.
[120:29.00]Can't hold up in that beat-up piece of shit outside.
[120:31.72]You didn't just call my all-American machine a beat-up.
[120:34.90]I'm just saying, they're better rides out there.
[120:36.84]Hey, bullshit they are.
[120:38.32]This car's a beast.
[120:39.17]I thought the custom 358 and the Ford shipped out.
[120:42.09]That ain't the only thing you dropped in there.
[120:43.83]Maybe you should tell them about how you borrow it from Ellis and take the ladies for a ride.
[120:48.98]Stuffed earlier today?
[120:49.96]What's happening?
[120:52.20]Hey, well, the time serpent took over and three months went by.
[120:55.52]But thanks again, regardless, dude.
[120:57.22]Hey, and you, funny man, you gonna fucking help?
[120:59.14]Like hell I am, shit, I didn't get any.
[121:01.22]Yeah, well, it was just no...
[121:10.35]Jesus Christ!
[121:11.13]This guy's Irish.
[121:12.42]He's got an Irish accent.
[121:22.80]Irish Nick Offerman.
[121:47.84]Come on.
[121:48.78]Let's get moving.
[121:49.66]Still got a swing box.
[121:51.34]Come on.
[121:52.29]Let's get moving.
[121:53.17]Still got a swing box.
[121:54.09]Are they drinking ketchup?
[121:55.59]Hey, you two assholes.
[121:57.65]Don't think this gets you off the hook when it comes to my car.
[122:00.05]Y'all best get ready to clean it.
[122:01.49]I ain't cleaning shit.
[122:02.95]Hey, you cleaning it.
[122:05.15]He just came in and reassured.
[122:06.35]Oh, no, you're cleaning it.
[122:07.77]Few of them good.
[122:10.88]This really is a documentary.
[122:13.54]So he knew about the canals underneath the city.
[122:16.80]And that one of them went right under the Federal Reserve.
[122:20.74]It was his idea to use a boat to move the drill into position.
[122:24.37]Alright, where's my thing to determine if she's lying or not?
[122:26.81]In L.A.
[122:26.93]Noire?
[122:27.05]He's a real son of a bitch, my father.
[122:28.93]More than anyone else, I blame him for what happened.
[122:34.96]You want to stick your own neck out?
[122:36.64]Fine.
[122:37.64]But leave your son out of it.
[122:42.60]It's his fault.
[122:43.56]Danny died.
[122:49.30]What?
[122:51.95]Is everyone in?
[122:52.67]We need to go.
[122:53.61]We are here.
[122:54.35]Go.
[122:55.63]Noir.
[122:56.45]L.A.
[122:56.63]Noir.
[122:57.55]We're just in a boat shooting.
[122:58.45]Okay.
[122:58.71]Got it.
[123:03.80]I have to try.
[123:04.40]I have to try.
[123:05.36]I have to try it.
[123:09.56]I don't care if I start over.
[123:10.42]I have to try.
[123:14.91]Wanted to just drive run somebody over Take it easy I'm gonna miles for this police down here, too We're like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sewers and there's police boats down here I
[123:45.50]Alrighty.
[123:45.86]Gonna like board their boat.
[123:59.43]Get him!
[124:01.37]Oh, we're going to explode!
[124:02.91]And this is where it's over.
[124:05.47]We blow up.
[124:11.79]Did somebody die?
[124:13.29]Who died?
[124:16.45]None of this makes any sense.
[124:18.28]That can't be how it happened.
[124:29.94]I love that so much.
[124:32.63]Wait, you mean to tell me that the guy drove up the boat on a wall and ran into two other boats?
[124:38.55]And then they burnt down?
[124:41.17]That can't be how it happened.
[124:46.22]Prince of Persia's storytelling.
[124:50.93]Alright, now I know what I'm doing.
[124:54.77]Move.
[124:55.97]Step on the gas.
[125:08.03]A boat caught fire, two of us died, and then I got arrested.
[125:12.06]What the hell happened?
[125:14.08]The time serpent came in and changed the notes!
[125:18.32]I gotta stay ahead.
[125:20.17]Don't do it again!
[125:21.09]God damn it!
[125:25.99]Well, I don't think they know where we are.
[125:28.87]If these guys weren't shooting the guns, the police wouldn't even know we were here.
[125:37.21]I am real bad at driving this boat.
[125:40.71]No!
[125:41.94]No, are you serious?
[125:43.80]Shit.
[125:44.48]Get to the end before we get the guy with the papers.
[125:49.76]Before the guy picks up the fucking briefcase.
[125:51.66]None of this makes any sense.
[126:03.90]That can't be how it happened.
[126:16.76]Turn on simulated boating.
[126:23.32]Needs more PNG fire.
[126:25.00]Alright.
[126:34.93]This is the one.
[126:36.11]This is it.
[126:42.80]I can't wait till something fucking crazy happens and like the mission fails and that guy picks up that stack of papers and is just like, I don't believe this shit.
[126:54.17]Hey guys, what do you know?
[126:55.25]Didn't crash.
[126:58.15]Didn't crash into that guy.
[127:06.04]Wait a second, wait.
[127:18.12]He didn't even tell me that it wouldn't... He didn't even pick up the papers.
[127:21.47]He didn't even want to do the papers.
[127:34.98]I didn't even get the gratification of him telling me that it didn't happen.
[127:39.18]That must have been how it happens in real life.
[127:42.48]He didn't pick up the papers.
[127:43.86]That's how it happened.
[127:51.47]Like seriously, why is this so hard?
[127:56.17]I just gotta show them I'm gonna die again Can these guys shoot the cops?
[128:04.07]I got three cop boats It's gonna explode dude, what the fuck?
[128:27.14]My stomach hurts.
[128:36.91]The boat's just on fucking fire.
[128:42.05]God.
[128:43.62]My fucking stomach.
[128:50.70]Oh, man.
[128:52.33]I did not do that right at all.
[128:55.43]I didn't do that right at all.
[128:59.91]See, they think it's funny, too.
[129:02.55]Oh, I just gave myself an ab workout right there.
[129:05.84]Just driving straight into that wall on fire.
[129:08.52]Oh, man.
[129:15.52]I don't think I was supposed to drive straight.
[129:16.80]I think I was supposed to lose him in the sewers.
[129:19.62]Oh, man.
[129:20.70]That hurt.
[129:23.40]That guy was yawning.
[129:26.70]Now I have like a runny nose.
[129:28.64]How did that happen?
[129:31.67]That must be... Oh, shit.
[129:32.75]His leg is all kinds of messed up right now.
[129:34.57]Look at that.
[129:51.64]Boom, America, thanks for nine months, dude.
[129:53.40]I feel like, I saw you, didn't I say the other day?
[129:56.78]I swear, I saw you subscribe the other day.
[129:58.50]Thanks for nine months, man.
[130:01.60]Yeah, what about the money?
[130:05.88]Do we have one backpack full of money?
[130:10.02]We have one, like, school book bag full of, like, a thousand bucks.
[130:13.12]Yeah, he's drunk, and his leg is bleeding profusely.
[130:21.64]Wait, what?
[130:24.57]Thanks a lot, AshenPants.
[130:36.17]Damn it.
[130:37.91]I can't just drop him.
[130:38.93]That's not cool.
[130:39.95]Too bad.
[130:40.45]Oh boy, we're in like Mardi Gras?
[130:43.93]Is that what this is?
[130:48.32]Yeah, we just got a drunk guy here.
[130:55.89]With a bleeding body.
[131:00.75]Do it.
[131:01.11]Do it.
[131:01.43]Do it.
[131:01.63]I tried.
[131:02.11]I tried.
[131:02.81]It didn't work.
[131:10.00]I can't... He's going too fast.
[131:11.32]I can't go that fast.
[131:13.22]Throw him to the gators.
[131:14.30]Oh, that would have been great.
[131:18.48]Wait a minute.
[131:23.18]Payphone?
[131:24.84]Phone booth works?
[131:26.67]Holy shit, guys.
[131:27.31]What did I tell you?
[131:27.77]10 out of 10.
[131:28.39]Phone works.
[131:33.21]Why can't they call?
[131:34.97]I clearly am carrying the extremely injured body.
[131:37.76]Danny, sir.
[131:37.96]I can't get a call to you because the roads are closed off.
[131:44.54]Those bandits made off with a clean 4673.
[131:47.80]Truly a heist for the ages.
[131:49.78]Look at that guy down there.
[131:59.04]For a second, I thought that was an actual person.
[132:00.89]I thought the game was severely fucked up.
[132:03.97]This dude right here.
[132:07.49]God bless the old man.
[132:08.41]Let's go.
[132:14.16]Can I fight this guy?
[132:15.16]I wish I could just knock this guy out.
[132:18.55]He's coming with us.
[132:19.25]I wanna take this guy with us.
[132:48.93]Where do you get a mask?
[132:49.67]I want to be this guy for Halloween.
[132:51.75]Where do you get a mask that big?
[133:00.11]We're going to get in the float?
[133:01.19]Is that what we're doing?
[133:03.77]He's part of the gang now.
[133:05.86]I wish.
[133:12.58]Please be more careful.
[133:15.09]That guy doesn't look like he's in any good sorts at all.
[133:18.41]Hey!
[133:18.61]I want someone to fall down.
[133:19.81]Somebody fall down!
[133:21.21]I'm looking for comedy!
[133:22.33]Somebody fucking fall down!
[133:45.52]You understand?
[133:46.70]Fall down.
[133:49.80]We're missing all kinds of comedy here.
[133:55.81]Nobody fell down.
[133:58.53]Oh, these people did.
[133:59.59]These guys fell down.
[134:03.81]Okay, like a bunch of people fell down.
[134:06.11]Just in the wrong room.
[134:12.18]This ain't GTA.
[134:13.38]Oh, yeah.
[134:14.04]That's true.
[134:17.66]For two seconds I thought this girl had two sticks of dynamite in her hands.
[134:20.92]And I was like, this ain't gonna end well.
[134:22.92]Nope, just sparklers.
[134:27.72]Okay, those are cops right there.
[134:32.49]Oh, we're fine.
[134:33.43]What do you mean they found the... Oh.
[134:43.29]Don't you see?
[134:45.05]Working on our comedy routine.
[134:49.96]What's going on, Waylon?
[134:50.86]Waylon147, thanks for eight months.
[134:52.78]And then thank you, Peaky Yay, for six months.
[134:57.42]Welcome back, both of you guys.
[134:58.58]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[134:59.58]Easy, easy, easy.
[135:00.38]Back, back, back, back, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[135:03.90]Back it up.
[135:04.16]We gotta cut through the boats.
[135:05.62]We can't fit through there.
[135:06.40]Okay.
[135:08.96]What the fuck is going on?
[135:09.84]They're just like... The police are just beating up somebody.
[135:14.03]Okay.
[135:15.23]I guess that's... We're just gonna go this way.
[135:23.62]Why is nobody getting suspicious?
[135:24.80]We're pretending he's drunk at Mardi Gras.
[135:29.54]Forget about the fact that he has a gash on his leg.
[135:31.54]Didn't we get a spoiler already?
[135:32.75]Doesn't this guy die?
[135:33.79]This guy, Danny.
[135:49.89]We all got a friend, Jesus.
[135:51.93]Amen.
[135:52.27]Alright, let's go.
[135:56.69]Those lizard costumes are pretty cool too.
[135:58.35]Oh, the alligators, whatever.
[136:06.23]Hey!
[136:07.07]Over here!
[136:08.85]What?
[136:09.55]What are you doing?
[136:12.02]What the hell is he doing?
[136:14.24]What am I doing?
[136:17.58]Why would you do something like that?
[136:21.69]Oh my goodness.
[136:25.33]Yeah, okay.
[136:26.59]Thanks.
[136:27.09]Oh, thank you.
[136:27.75]Thanks for getting all the police over here.
[136:29.15]What was the point of that?
[136:32.66]Are you out of your mind?
[136:36.20]Hold on a second.
[136:36.66]There's a guy.
[136:37.12]There he is.
[136:41.94]There he is.
[136:43.46]There's a guy.
[136:44.02]There's a guy with a funny head.
[136:45.04]I had to do it.
[136:47.24]I had to do it.
[136:59.06]Can I jump?
[136:59.52]Nope.
[136:59.66]It's okay.
[137:06.21]I'm going to be safe over here.
[137:07.63]Through the graveyard.
[137:14.71]Oh, see ya.
[137:17.08]Oh, boy.
[137:19.19]Blue police.
[137:19.69]Some of the heats often you're in a blue police zone.
[137:22.33]You're the blue police zone on the mini-map.
[137:24.31]Yeah, you stealth and avoid police.
[137:25.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[137:26.22]How many times does it say police in this?
[137:31.16]Get on the roof.
[137:35.70]I can't get on the roof.
[137:36.38]Alright, well I'm just going to hang out in here.
[137:42.45]Fuck.
[137:55.13]Don't move.
[137:55.57]I'm being quiet.
[138:00.88]Come on.
[138:01.26]Get out of the way.
[138:02.30]Go do your patrol, you idiots.
[138:06.04]Something tells me you shouldn't be holding a shotgun out where two people are just talking.
[138:09.02]You're just pointing it at them.
[138:09.96]Go!
[138:10.94]Get out of the way.
[138:11.56]You're causing too many problems, man.
[138:16.42]I think they're just staying here forever.
[138:19.85]Where's the prone button?
[138:27.83]Had to do it.
[138:30.51]That was the only way I was going to be able to get out of that.
[138:35.62]Had to do it.
[138:41.06]One, two, three.
[138:45.90]I made it out.
[138:47.10]And the only casualty was the big-legged leprechaun guy.
[138:50.86]And that guy.
[138:52.16]And that guy.
[138:55.41]Come on.
[138:56.71]Come on.
[138:56.95]That did more damage than anybody else in the whole game.
[138:59.49]Drive it into a dumpster.
[139:04.83]Get out of here.
[139:07.36]Holy shit.
[139:09.38]Holy shit.
[139:11.30]And somehow, after all that, I think I got away.
[139:16.08]There's only one car behind me.
[139:22.92]This frame rate is killing me.
[139:30.00]Why?
[139:30.28]What kind of right, left turn was that?
[139:32.10]I'm gonna go up this way.
[139:41.91]Okay, this is gonna be real tricky for this guy to do.
[139:45.55]Yeah, he can't even do it.
[139:46.43]He just smashed.
[139:46.95]He's still here.
[139:49.29]Come on.
[139:53.90]It honestly would help if this guy would stop shooting out the back.
[139:59.89]Idiot, get out of the way.
[140:01.89]How are you already this close?
[140:03.07]That almost seems impossible.
[140:06.87]We're going to have to go for a major move here, guys.
[140:10.77]Major move.
[140:13.93]Major lose move.
[140:15.21]I think we're losing them.
[140:26.02]Hey, guy in the front seat, don't think you're going to hit him from back here.
[140:29.72]You should stop shooting the gun.
[140:34.29]That was a major move, Luz.
[140:35.65]And I didn't do it.
[140:36.57]It's okay.
[140:38.79]We're good.
[140:41.15]No witness is good.
[140:44.19]I scraped her.
[140:45.96]I scraped her back.
[140:47.76]I gave her like a rug burn.
[140:50.16]She's okay.
[140:50.76]She's going to be fine.
[140:51.40]Don't worry.
[140:55.53]I'm robbing people with a six gun.
[140:59.13]I fought the law and the law can kiss my ass.
[141:05.52]Give me a place to go.
[141:07.34]I fought the law and the law lost.
[141:13.18]Yeah.
[141:13.80]Alright.
[141:14.44]Cool.
[141:19.71]No, she's fine.
[141:20.99]I just skimmed her back, so I took off one layer of skin.
[141:24.18]She's going to be fine.
[141:24.94]Holy mother of God.
[141:29.64]Once everything's settled up, I'm calling the man I know, having him bring over three hookers.
[141:34.00]Boy, ain't no hooker ever stepping foot in this house.
[141:36.99]You sure?
[141:37.75]Because two of them are for you.
[141:41.31]This can't be how it happened.
[141:42.97]I'd appreciate that.
[141:44.11]You know, my entire life there's always been someone standing over me.
[142:00.94]This game's fun.
[142:01.82]I like this game.
[142:04.84]I am enjoying myself in this game.
[142:06.62]It's fun.
[142:08.50]A little cutscene intensive, but story's kind of cool.
[142:10.89]It's got some interesting things going on.
[142:12.77]The gameplay is like, I smashed a leprechaun's face into the ground.
[142:16.03]That's enough for me.
[142:19.58]I mean, no one's standing over me again.
[142:24.38]Over any of us.
[142:25.58]He's still in the intro.
[142:27.36]Look at what I dug up.
[142:28.76]You mind pouring one more of those?
[142:44.30]Skip all cutscenes.
[142:45.22]Well, I don't want to skip the intro stuff.
[142:47.13]This is important stuff.
[142:47.87]Dude, somebody's gonna get... Somebody's gonna get, like, killed right here.
[143:09.04]That guy Danny is going to get murdered right now.
[143:11.14]This is not good.
[143:12.68]This guy is scary.
[143:13.46]I don't like this guy.
[143:14.96]I don't like this guy.
[143:34.81]This is not... And here comes the copyright music.
[143:40.48]What the fuck?
[143:52.20]Did he just shoot the main character in the face?
[143:56.89]Oh my god.
[144:01.95]He just shot the main character in the fucking head.
[144:05.07]When I got the sammies, the whole place was burning.
[144:08.73]I still don't know what brought me there that night.
[144:11.33]Luck?
[144:11.43]Divine Providence?
[144:11.90]Or something else?
[144:41.13]I'm angry.
[144:43.75]Wow, that's just like... Damn.
[144:58.04]It's not lethal for the main character.
[145:02.07]See, it's something to do with the time serpent.
[145:04.09]Told you guys.
[145:06.10]When I was pulling Lincoln out of the fire, he woke up long enough to tell me to call John Donovan.
[145:13.62]So that's what I did.
[145:16.82]Most days I wish I'd never made that call.
[145:19.81]Shouldn't have said no.
[145:20.71]Mr. Donovan, do you know this individual?
[145:25.07]Sure.
[145:26.57]What is he talking about?
[145:27.39]Shouldn't have said no.
[145:29.07]I thought we were like working together.
[145:30.55]I thought I said yes.
[145:35.23]Enough with the dog and pony bullshit.
[145:37.96]What's your real question?
[145:42.06]Did you help Lincoln Clay murder Sal Marcano and all prominent members of his crime family?
[145:48.40]You're goddamn right I did.
[145:50.77]Oh boy.
[145:58.11]So it's a revenge story that I know the ending to.
[146:00.77]I know I'm gonna get there with the bat.
[146:03.44]I'm gonna bury it in that guy's head.
[146:11.01]Oh, he asked me to... Okay, right.
[146:12.45]He asked me to run the... Yeah.
[146:15.09]Okay, I remember now.
[146:49.32]So those are the men you're going to kill, huh?
[146:52.36]That's the plan, Padre.
[146:53.52]Am I the only one that doesn't like how the game tells you how everything's going to happen?
[146:57.62]Yeah, I mean, I guess you could probably guess that, though.
[147:00.99]Mafia 3 is go get Sal Barcano.
[147:05.55]But let that be the end of it.
[147:07.21]That's not enough!
[147:07.95]It's enough if you say it's enough.
[147:15.19]This ain't going on YouTube.
[147:16.47]Well, I mean, certain parts of it.
[147:21.22]I know what Sal did to you, Lincoln.
[147:24.26]But nothing you do will bring any of them back.
[147:31.89]This isn't about bringing them back.
[147:35.09]Or even exacting some street justice.
[147:39.05]It's about making that bastard feel what it's like to lose everything.
[147:44.27]Watch as I take it all away from him.
[147:50.44]Am I going to play the entire game?
[147:51.68]I don't know.
[147:53.26]Yeah, maybe.
[147:54.80]I'm having fun so far.
[147:55.82]So, I mean, might as well just play the whole thing.
[147:58.83]Yeah, I mean, like, yeah.
[148:02.67]Thanks a lot, FaithfulVenom.
[148:03.99]So, who is this guy, Donovan?
[148:04.79]Is he, like, he's the guy that's going to help me do it?
[148:19.46]24-hour stream?
[148:23.46]No.
[148:28.88]I left for five minutes.
[148:29.80]What happened?
[148:30.80]You missed quite a plot point.
[148:33.68]You missed a major plot point.
[148:35.91]Here comes another song.
[148:36.75]Copyright song.
[148:38.05]This part of the stream is muted.
[148:40.61]How much more licensed music is it going to be in this stream? ...
[148:57.39]Turn it off.
[149:00.07]Turn off this music.
[149:04.17]Turn this music off.
[149:05.25]This music is not playing in a church.
[149:08.35]Maybe it is.
[149:09.46]But I don't want it playing on the stream.
[149:12.56]It's just getting louder.
[149:16.32]It's getting louder.
[149:17.58]It's not getting... Turn off the music!
[149:28.29]Turn it off.
[149:31.19]Turn off the music.
[149:37.61]How do I turn it off?
[149:43.24]He was sleeping.
[149:46.56]Enjoy the view.
[149:47.26]Get me in the car.
[149:54.46]Please have it turned off.
[150:00.16]It's so loud.
[150:01.08]Why is it this loud?
[150:05.10]Can you guys hear a damn word this guy's saying?
[150:12.71]Holy shit.
[150:19.31]No, it's part of the cinematic.
[150:21.69]Never ready to be out.
[150:23.02]The cinematic ended like 35 seconds ago.
[150:31.57]I don't think this is supposed to be happening.
[150:35.11]This is definitely not supposed to keep playing.
[150:42.35]It's still playing!
[150:46.93]It played the whole song!
[150:51.82]Okay, I just had to get in a bad car accident and it went away.
[150:54.22]Are you doing that on purpose?
[150:57.26]Are you doing that on purpose?
[150:58.00]Where was I?
[150:59.52]Do you think what happened is your fault?
[151:01.02]I ought to see another one.
[151:02.95]One second.
[151:03.51]Hold on.
[151:03.89]Hold on.
[151:19.61]So we can actually hear what the hell the guy's saying.
[151:21.23]The car booger coming out of a big nose.
[151:23.59]Take it over, huh?
[151:24.45]Alright, simulated driving.
[151:25.51]I'll do it.
[151:26.07]Fine.
[151:50.31]Where is it?
[151:53.03]Where is simulated driving?
[151:55.41]You people have been asking for it.
[151:58.25]Driving mode?
[152:00.09]Simulation.
[152:02.23]Simulated driving.
[152:03.63]Done.
[152:03.89]What?
[152:04.29]Oh, I thought it was gonna, like, do it for me.
[152:21.00]I thought it was going to simulate the driving for me.
[152:22.92]Where am I going?
[152:24.24]What?
[152:24.34]It's so simulated.
[152:25.76]It's a simulation.
[152:26.64]It's a simulation.
[152:32.28]You're part of a simulation.
[152:53.39]Hey, I just got shot in the fucking face.
[152:56.96]How is this any different?
[152:57.68]I don't get it.
[153:00.92]How is this a simulation?
[153:04.12]Somebody tell me.
[153:09.51]I... I... What?
[153:10.81]I just got an achievement.
[153:13.35]No, no, listen, listen, listen.
[153:14.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[153:14.67]I know I'm going the wrong way.
[153:15.99]I wanted to test out the simulated driving.
[153:19.03]Going fast.
[153:21.47]Calm down.
[153:22.39]It's easy.
[153:25.93]I wanted to see like with big turret.
[153:27.89]What's the difference?
[153:32.42]It drifts more?
[153:38.10]That car would not break.
[153:39.46]Oh shit.
[153:40.34]It was just gonna kill.
[153:43.10]Who hit one of those student driver cars?
[153:45.50]Did he hit the brakes on the passenger side?
[154:01.31]Simulate it.
[154:02.11]I'm gonna turn it off.
[154:04.03]I don't get it.
[154:08.83]I don't get it.
[154:19.76]Jesus, I was trying.
[154:20.94]I was trying so desperately to jump out of the car.
[154:23.26]Alright, get out of here.
[154:31.86]Oh, it's his car.
[154:32.52]Alright, well, have a good one.
[154:35.91]See you later!
[154:47.93]Fuck!
[154:48.39]I thought he was going to drive right into that pole.
[154:50.27]That was the reason why I was staying there.
[154:54.26]Why am I sneaking into this guy's house?
[154:55.60]G?
[154:55.78]What do you mean G?
[154:58.78]I don't have any grenades.
[155:03.78]Retrieve your gear?
[155:06.44]What the hell's going on?
[155:13.65]Am I alright?
[155:14.19]What's happening here?
[155:17.73]Welcome home, son.
[155:19.03]Oh, I'm having like a flashback.
[155:22.33]Okay, this is creepy.
[155:25.19]Jesus.
[155:26.29]Now who wants to get shitfaced?
[155:32.72]That motherfucker, he's done.
[155:38.42]He's the first one to go down.
[155:39.50]What a monster.
[155:41.72]What the fuck is right, dude?
[156:08.78]Now we got more, more, another cutscene.
[156:12.84]What is this?
[156:13.48]Oh, he's just in the... Getting his gear.
[156:19.34]My old, my old piece.
[156:21.06]My old gun.
[156:21.58]Melee weapon.
[156:22.22]That's what I see.
[156:22.96]I see a big knife.
[156:24.58]That's a melee weapon.
[156:42.69]Feeding mobsters through a wood chipper is looking like a really decent form of judicial punishment.
[156:47.36]He calls the guy a monster.
[157:02.70]Use your combat knife to perform lethal takedowns on enemies.
[157:05.38]You can also select non-lethal takedowns in the options menu under game.
[157:08.96]Can I pull the knife out?
[157:14.42]Is it an actual weapon or is it only for takedowns?
[157:18.74]When you're out in the field, any money you collect will be stored in your wallet.
[157:21.89]If you're killed in action, you'll lose a sizable portion of the money in your wallet, so it's best to stash it.
[157:26.45]Oh, great.
[157:29.91]Okay, well, let's store the money because you know I'm going to die all the time.
[157:33.33]Alright, stash that cash.
[157:39.47]Stash.
[157:40.65]Okay.
[157:41.53]Wait, anything else in here that I need to do?
[157:44.59]Oh, there they are.
[157:45.47]They're the magazines, dude.
[157:48.11]Oh, dude, like I found my dad's Playboy.
[157:50.61]I can't wait to read it when he's not home.
[157:55.04]Oh, man, it's going to be sick.
[157:59.65]Okay, let's go.
[158:05.05]Stash of cash.
[158:10.05]Safe houses are sponsored around noob or do, where you'll meet up with assets and allies.
[158:14.51]You can't enter safe houses if you're in combat or being chased by the police.
[158:17.43]Okay.
[158:22.12]This is my ride right here.
[158:23.32]This is my car.
[158:25.80]I like these colors.
[158:28.48]I like this car.
[158:32.63]I really do like this car a lot.
[158:41.67]Okay, Donovan.
[158:44.90]I'm getting really good at doing the back scrape on people.
[158:48.22]Not enough to cause any real damage, but... Not enough to get in trouble.
[158:54.53]Can you just... Do I have to climb in his window?
[159:01.93]G?
[159:02.17]I just pressed G. It didn't do anything.
[159:06.30]I wish I could climb in this window.
[159:10.96]G?
[159:13.46]I'm pressing G. I don't have any grenades.
[159:15.38]I can't do anything with G. Alright, did I shoot your window?
[159:28.95]Ha!
[159:29.05]You weren't lying about setting up a tax center.
[159:31.17]The key to running a successful black bag operation is plausible deniability.
[159:35.59]Which is why I stole all this shit from the FBI.
[159:39.35]Things go tits up, those chicken dicks can deal with the fallout.
[159:43.27]Glad to see you haven't lost your touch.
[159:45.71]If there's one thing I'm good at, it's fucking with Hoover's fairy brigade.
[159:51.32]This guy's not going to turn on me, is he, like mid-game?
[159:53.18]Press G in the car?
[159:53.56]I thought I did.
[159:54.67]Didn't do anything.
[159:55.17]Dixie Mafia.
[160:16.56]What does G do in the car?
[160:18.74]He looks like somebody that would shoot me in the head.
[160:31.99]Okey-dokey.
[160:33.29]Wait, I get a speed boost?
[161:02.96]If I hold down G in a car, I get a super speed boost.
[161:04.86]Are you serious?
[161:05.73]No way.
[161:12.81]Alright.
[161:13.83]Let's see if you guys are trying to tell the truth or what.
[161:19.21]Super speed boost.
[161:20.05]G. I'm holding G and it's not doing anything.
[161:27.95]Am I driving?
[161:29.19]Holding G.
[161:36.37]Not doing anything.
[161:40.55]What are you guys on about?
[161:43.21]Did I just get lied to that there was a speed boost in this game?
[161:45.85]Okay, wait for the Haitians.
[161:52.85]Okay.
[161:55.13]Press it harder.
[161:57.83]See, and you maybe just almost backscrape another person.
[162:04.84]They meant H.
[162:06.84]They didn't do anything either.
[162:10.74]Why do you trust chat?
[162:11.58]It happens every time.
[162:12.42]Because I'm hoping that one time... It's gonna be for real.
[162:15.89]Do I need to wait for them?
[162:18.77]Or are they just gonna... Shut up.
[162:28.70]Do they have to be sitting on the bench?
[162:34.70]Or are they... What's the deal?
[162:38.26]Alright, I'm gonna wait for the Haitians.
[162:39.82]Whoever that means, wherever they are.
[162:41.58]Okay, I guess I have to sit on the bench.
[162:57.44]No, here comes another cutscene!
[163:01.15]Oh, no, hold on.
[163:01.59]Uh-oh.
[163:01.89]Is it the guy in the truck?
[163:03.07]That's the guy in the truck.
[163:24.30]Somebody just got run over.
[163:25.10]Wasn't the guy in the truck.
[163:30.18]The guy in the taxi.
[163:31.57]Alright, get up.
[163:41.25]Got inside.
[163:42.93]And get the informant.
[163:43.69]Okay, find and interrogate the informant.
[163:46.93]Isolate him through combat or stalking and then approach him.
[163:49.55]I'm a master of stalking.
[163:55.33]Where is he?
[163:55.71]Where's the money?
[164:00.16]Where's that fucking money?
[164:01.14]Yeah.
[164:01.40]Ooh.
[164:01.58]See, I don't care about you.
[164:02.94]Okay, I got the info.
[164:30.67]No!
[164:31.05]I lost money!
[164:33.79]I didn't think they were going to shoot me.
[164:38.51]Where am I?
[164:41.85]Did I... Okay, I completed the mission?
[164:45.62]Yeah, I completed the mission.
[164:46.60]I lost all the money I just made.
[164:50.30]Goof run, a go-go.
[164:52.80]Goof run, a go-go.
[164:54.88]Turn off radio, hold 4.
[164:56.10]Yes, thank you.
[164:57.92]Wait, that can't be how it happened.
[164:59.24]I want that.
[165:04.46]You guys don't think I'm gonna be driving around in that weird Jeep?
[165:09.88]You got another thing coming if you don't think I'm gonna steal this.
[165:16.50]Witnesses are civilians who will rush to the phone or the nearest cop if they see you committing a crime.
[165:21.39]Immobilize the witness using a non-lethal takedown.
[165:25.41]Witness!
[165:27.35]Stop the witness!
[165:28.17]Stop the witness!
[165:29.33]Stop the witness!
[165:30.39]He's on the phone!
[165:31.41]He's calling him up right now!
[165:36.46]Oh shit, another witness!
[165:40.21]Wait, there's another witness!
[165:41.55]Somebody else is calling the police!
[165:45.59]Okay, we're good.
[165:46.15]No more witnesses.
[165:48.25]Okay, no more witnesses.
[165:49.30]We're fine.
[165:50.12]We're fine.
[165:50.70]We're good.
[165:53.60]Get back in.
[165:54.20]Wait a minute, that's a witness.
[165:56.16]That's a witness.
[165:58.10]That's a witness.
[166:00.06]It's okay.
[166:00.52]Give them a little tippy tap in the face and they're fine.
[166:03.22]Just give them a little tip tap.
[166:05.98]What is this?
[166:17.11]Oh shit, the Jeep!
[166:18.49]The Jeep!
[166:19.61]The Jeep!
[166:20.81]I forgot about the Jeep.
[166:22.27]Hold on.
[166:26.43]Get out of the way.
[166:27.77]Get out of the way.
[166:30.94]Why can't I get out of the car?
[166:34.69]Oh shit, a witness!
[166:39.71]Where's the Jeep?
[166:40.35]Alright, there's another Jeep.
[166:42.45]I'll take this Jeep.
[166:44.13]Get out of the way.
[166:46.58]Oh, and by the way, you didn't say shit.
[166:53.94]Go!
[166:57.42]Alright.
[166:59.47]We made it out boys and girls!
[167:06.54]There we are!
[167:07.74]We got the Jeep!
[167:08.62]This one's a better Jeep!
[167:31.62]Alright, here we go.
[167:33.16]I made it.
[167:35.37]You guys thought I was gonna run into these people.
[167:37.89]I'm not a fucking monster.
[167:39.61]I'm not an animal.
[167:43.85]Okay, that guy's scared.
[167:44.93]Okay, it's as if I ran into that guy.
[167:56.18]Find a way into the house.
[167:58.44]Easy, the fucking front door.
[168:03.86]I need me to like... I fucking failed it.
[168:06.22]Failed it again.
[168:07.37]Failed it a third time.
[168:09.31]DON'T SHOW WITNESS!
[168:27.92]What do I need to do in here?
[168:31.26]Uh, search for the... search for the heart.
[168:40.93]Where's this heart?
[168:42.93]Upstairs?
[168:47.59]That door kick really got me, man.
[168:49.23]That was fucking crazy.
[168:56.76]Wait.
[168:57.80]The next mission.
[168:58.48]Wait!
[168:59.62]Okay, I'll wait.
[169:15.16]Nice trick you pulled back at the Haitian.
[169:17.20]He's just like huh and Ibaka was holding you prisoner.
[169:19.57]Oh wait.
[169:19.87]This is this I got swindled stone Shit so I got I got swindled stoned certainly does What can I do for you Lincoln clay I want you to help me kill Sal Marcano I see
[169:39.94]A few months ago, you was trying to kill me.
[169:41.88]Oh, wait.
[169:42.08]She witnessed me.
[169:43.14]Now you break in here and expect me to trust you?
[169:47.27]I'm a witness.
[169:50.33]When they do, they'll kill everyone standing in their way.
[169:53.55]Lest I hitch my horse to your wagon, so to speak.
[169:57.81]I'll see to it that you get the hollow.
[169:59.85]After that, depends on how things shake out.
[170:02.72]This music.
[170:03.52]Do you know why I sent me an hour at war?
[170:06.54]On account of you going after the lottery?
[170:08.36]Please.
[170:10.77]Just because you don't want to face some uncomfortable truths ain't a reason to act naive.
[170:17.77]The following is rated 18+.
[170:18.99]The people in Dehalla deserve better than a two-faced old man who handed out cans of food whenever the mood hit him.
[170:27.65]Who always did what Sal Marcana told him to do, even if it pitted him against his own people.
[170:33.03]He did the best he could.
[170:34.49]And yet his best didn't amount to much, did it?
[170:43.22]She's one of the serpents.
[170:44.84]Dude, that little jab is, like, my favorite thing in the game.
[170:49.94]It's such a little, like... Whoa.
[171:11.99]LIKES TO KIDNAP BLACK TEENAGERS AND TAKE THEM OUT TO THE BAYOU.
[171:16.33]AFTER STARVING HIM FOR A FEW DAYS, HE CUTS THEM LOOSE AND TELLS THEM TO RUN.
[171:22.39]SOMETIMES HE BRINGS OUT THE DOGS, YOU KNOW, FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.
[171:34.39]THAT'S... THAT'S HOW HE KILLED MY SISTER.
[171:46.03]This is all I have left.
[171:48.49]How do I find him?
[171:55.56]It's still dangerous around here.
[171:56.96]Should I, like, be trusting her?
[171:58.02]I mean, I feel like... Was she kind of... But his men operate out of the community church in the old theater.
[172:02.89]Pearl, as it used to be called.
[172:05.51]He was named after Sammy's wife.
[172:11.13]Look at that.
[172:12.11]Look at his head.
[172:12.61]That is a massive scar there.
[172:15.12]A little DG to doubt.
[172:15.96]Alright.
[172:42.53]Okay, I have money I think now.
[172:44.45]I'd probably associate gain arms dealer.
[172:46.69]Buy weapons and equipment on the go.
[172:50.73]By recruiting Cassandra, you've gained access to her associate, the arms dealer.
[172:54.86]As you increase earn for your underbosses, they will give you access to their associates and upgrade to their services.
[173:02.08]The basic arms dealer has a mobile weapons and equipment store.
[173:05.44]You can view future upgrades for the arms dealer in the assets menu under associates and upgrades.
[173:10.11]Cool.
[173:13.41]Why don't I just take the whole van?
[173:18.65]You know what I mean?
[173:20.21]Just give me the whole thing.
[173:21.19]I'll take the whole van.
[173:27.71]That was apparently something important, but we're not going to look at it.
[173:32.88]Where's my mouse?
[173:33.56]Where's it going?
[173:36.08]I see some...
[173:39.74]I have to use the keyboard arrows and enter.
[173:43.68]Really.
[173:47.18]Shotguns, handguns, automatics.
[173:49.81]I want melee weapons.
[173:52.61]Explosives.
[173:53.97]Modifications.
[173:56.81]Upgrades for Lincoln.
[173:57.79]Adrenaline storage.
[174:00.75]Oh, boy.
[174:03.12]I don't have... I have 1,200 bucks.
[174:06.12]Shit, I only have 1,200 bits.
[174:09.00]This is 180,000 bits.
[174:16.12]Is this what you guys are talking about?
[174:18.65]Vehicle armor, bulletproof tires, body kit upgrades, supercharger.
[174:22.73]I'm going to just fucking glitch the game out.
[174:26.97]Watch this.
[174:28.19]They didn't think they knew about this.
[174:29.23]Didn't patch this exploit, did you, 2K?
[174:35.51]Got it.
[174:40.56]I'll just buy ammo for it.
[174:41.48]I don't have any money.
[174:50.57]I watched an ad for this.
[174:53.37]For this what?
[174:53.81]Are you making fun of my stream?
[174:55.41]Uh-oh.
[175:09.95]I think it's time for a permanent 10-second ban.
[175:14.51]Oh, Jesus.
[175:17.07]A thousand bits.
[175:20.27]I need... Some guns!
[175:24.09]What was that?
[175:24.59]What happens if I just move him in the middle of traffic?
[175:38.26]Is he eventually gonna, like...
[175:41.60]Start to drive the car.
[175:54.94]I wish I'd get a reaction from this guy.
[175:56.56]Alright, see you later.
[175:58.40]It was fun.
[176:02.53]Oh, fuck this guy.
[176:16.32]We've become one car.
[176:19.98]Give me what's in the back of that shit, man.
[176:22.44]I want it.
[176:23.82]I'll take you with me.
[176:24.86]You're my personal armory.
[176:34.84]Okay, bye.
[176:35.52]There's a witness.
[176:39.24]There is a witness.
[176:44.42]See you later.
[176:44.92]It was fun.
[176:53.42]I accidentally shot that lady in the arm.
[177:00.37]Don't let the witnesses get away.
[177:01.69]They didn't see shit.
[177:08.90]Oh!
[177:14.38]Straight shot, straight shot, straight shot, straight shot.
[177:18.35]Damn it!
[177:26.47]Did he get it off?
[177:28.13]I'm gonna pick up the phone.
[177:28.97]Uh, yeah, I was just kidding.
[177:31.51]There's nobody actually here.
[177:33.52]Uh, don't worry.
[177:34.40]Don't send the police.
[177:35.28]That guy's calling the police.
[177:39.14]No, wait, this isn't done.
[177:47.54]God, come on.
[177:48.96]No!
[177:56.00]I should just camp the phone.
[177:59.92]Oh god damn.
[178:07.62]There's so many people calling the police.
[178:13.19]Where did she go?
[178:13.91]Where did the other one go?
[178:16.67]Oh come on.
[178:21.31]Every person I get rid of, another witness comes out.
[178:26.38]I don't even care anymore.
[178:27.44]They're already coming.
[178:28.30]The cops are already here.
[178:29.30]Just gonna get to the marker and I'll be fine.
[178:38.41]Get to the marker.
[178:41.41]It's a spray and pray.
[178:44.39]Spray and pray, right?
[178:45.25]This is definitely a spray and pray.
[178:50.26]Cops will be off me in a second.
[178:54.00]Just enter the spray and pray.
[178:58.26]What am I supposed to be doing?
[178:59.58]Talk to the voice?
[179:01.60]What?
[179:07.98]What voice?
[179:10.56]Oh, that's a prostitute.
[179:11.84]Um... Huh.
[179:15.88]I don't think I wanna do this on stream.
[179:17.82]That's probably not a great idea.
[179:20.08]Alright, hold on.
[179:24.43]I'm gonna be, like, ready to, like...
[179:30.50]Is this the only mission I have?
[179:38.18]Okay, here we go.
[179:38.88]I'm about to... Oh, that's the prostitute.
[179:42.44]Here's the prostitute that was waiting in here for me.
[179:52.83]Been a while.
[179:53.29]Wouldn't expect to see you working with the Haitians.
[179:56.07]It's either this or bow down to them fucking coon asses.
[179:59.10]And you know I ain't ever been one to bow down to anyone.
[180:04.12]Ain't that the goddamn truth?
[180:05.76]Cassandra phoned ahead.
[180:07.78]Said you going out to Perla.
[180:09.68]There she is.
[180:10.24]Asshole named Merle Jackson runs it.
[180:13.12]Turned it into a brothel.
[180:14.82]That's why fellas come in and do whatever they want to our young sisters.
[180:18.43]How do I get to them?
[180:19.89]You don't.
[180:21.01]Not yet anyway.
[180:21.99]A lot of those Dixie fucks try to stay out of sight.
[180:25.61]There's someone put a bullet up their ass.
[180:28.85]Read up on the terms of service it's fine.
[180:31.33]Okay.
[181:00.92]Busting up rackets.
[181:01.72]Every racket's vulnerable.
[181:02.92]Hurt their ability to make money to force the racket boss to come deal with the damage you've done.
[181:10.73]Draw out Merle by damaging his prostitution racket in the hollow.
[181:14.05]The first step in doing that is to free the girls being held hostage at Ducat's.
[181:17.22]15,000 dollars.
[181:17.68]Okay, damn.
[181:27.77]So is there nudity in this game that I need to be aware of in case of, you know, Twitch terms of service?
[181:33.59]There's a boat right here.
[181:34.25]Are you serious?
[181:37.19]Nice.
[181:50.94]It's a pretty cool boat.
[181:52.36]Where's my boat garage?
[181:56.98]Yes, there is nothing in the magazines.
[182:00.12]It's safe.
[182:10.05]Don't read the magazines.
[182:25.85]How far away is this place?
[182:26.67]Oh, it's like right here.
[182:30.85]Okay.
[182:33.95]So, to avoid, like, looking at, like, any of the nudity, I'm gonna sprint in and just get the guy and sprint out.
[182:43.83]Let's hope there's no nudity in here, because if there is, like, I'm gonna have to sprint in there and, like, grab the guy and drag him out and run back out.
[182:57.01]You hacked these bits for me?
[182:58.13]Well, thank you, VamEvan.
[183:01.53]Actually, I think I missed quite a few people.

[186:07.04]I just almost got shot in the head.
[186:15.66]And you are now free as well.
[186:16.64]Thank you very much.
[186:17.44]Let's get out of here.
[186:18.12]Goodbye.
[186:18.84]There's somebody in here.
[186:19.60]Somebody in this one.
[186:20.66]Somebody... Okay.
[186:28.87]Alright, we're good.
[186:30.19]Get out, get out, get out.
[186:32.68]Off the balcony!
[186:33.18]Out the window!
[186:37.02]Out the fucking window!
[186:38.85]Out the window!
[186:41.33]There's furniture in the way!
[186:43.39]Oh shit!
[186:54.55]Whoa, outside.
[186:57.37]Who puts a gate like this here?
[187:00.30]Am I an infant?
[187:00.92]Are you serious?
[187:04.09]Can't go that way.
[187:07.39]Can I go... Oh, you're gonna do what?
[187:10.08]What was that, sir?
[187:11.14]What was that?
[187:11.46]What was that again?
[187:12.84]Get me close?
[187:14.70]Yeah, didn't think so.
[187:16.06]Thanks for the money.
[187:18.46]I gotta be able to jump out one of these windows.
[187:24.96]I just broke that lamp with my head.
[187:26.48]Ow, I just... Ow, I just stubbed my toe.
[187:34.14]Alright, I think we can calm down now.
[187:36.74]Easy.
[187:40.44]Get some money over here, too.
[187:46.23]Okay, wow, that was a lot of money.
[187:49.71]Okay, there's a lot more money in here.
[187:55.53]Drawn him in the bathtub.
[188:04.61]What?
[188:07.07]What the fuck is going on?
[188:09.43]Oh, it's this guy.
[188:16.39]That was easy.
[188:19.03]Missed the safe?
[188:20.59]I'll get the safe.
[188:21.13]I just can't look at anything.
[188:23.91]Got that.
[188:27.23]Got that one.
[188:29.73]There's $5,000 remaining.
[188:30.62]Where is it?
[188:35.79]Where's the safe?
[188:36.59]Shit.
[188:54.00]Give me the shotgun.
[188:55.16]It's more reliable right now.
[188:59.94]There's money right here.
[189:02.82]So I freaked out and ran by the safe?
[189:08.74]Break the toilet?
[189:10.16]There's no money in the toilet.
[189:20.02]Okay, so there's one more money symbol right here.
[189:25.98]Still need... There's still $4,700 in here.
[189:32.90]Whatever.
[189:33.10]I don't even care.
[189:33.76]Get me out of here.
[189:43.62]I'm trying to look for that safe.
[189:46.39]What was I lied to?
[189:47.69]Again.
[189:54.75]I like this idea.
[189:55.55]Oh, this place cleared out.
[189:57.83]Hey, I can take my time now.
[190:00.07]Don't have to worry about anything.
[190:02.47]Hostile zone.
[190:03.05]Okay, that box, that sounded like a bunch of people sprinting down the stairs at me.
[190:14.01]I'm just getting out of here.
[190:14.71]I got what I needed.
[190:17.25]Freed the people.
[190:19.38]Save is behind the mirror?
[190:20.94]I don't believe you.
[190:22.50]Hey, it's this guy again.
[190:24.94]Hey, guy.
[190:26.54]Uh, give me ammo.
[190:29.14]Alright, I'll get the hell out of here.
[190:36.25]Box clipping, box physics.
[190:41.29]I'll be taking this.
[190:42.23]Thank you.
[190:50.11]I think I saw a nipple during that mission.
[190:51.81]We're going down, fellas.
[190:53.09]It was nice knowing you.
[190:54.98]The mission's not done yet.
[190:55.78]What do you mean the mission's not done yet?
[190:56.96]Yeah, it is.
[191:00.64]I just liberated people.
[191:03.00]I got them out of the area.
[191:09.39]Oh, there's a... CIA?
[191:10.99]CIA?
[191:18.37]Alright, let's go talk to the guy from the CIA.
[191:29.42]He's not, like, in there with a prostitute, is he?
[191:31.96]He probably... I think he is.
[191:34.65]All my looking at the ground is going to be for nothing.
[191:36.65]I thought he was going to be banging somebody in here.
[191:40.12]What?
[191:40.22]Portable radio?
[191:40.74]Calling associates.
[192:05.45]Okay, you can give the arms dealer a call.
[192:08.29]Alright, alright, cool.
[192:10.89]Hold the middle mouse button and select associate.
[192:17.08]Arms dealer.
[192:18.32]Okay.
[192:20.16]Cool.
[192:22.04]He is the prostitute.
[192:28.28]He came in the strip club and looked at the ceiling?
[192:30.46]No, this can't be right.
[192:31.98]This can't be how it happened.
[192:47.07]I was looking at chat right there, and I'm just driving into other people.
[192:52.73]Need to get all the money?
[192:56.10]Says who?
[193:00.56]Damage remaining, 3200.
[193:07.85]I don't care.
[193:08.43]You're paying me for that.
[193:10.25]Yeah, I did it.
[193:13.49]God damn, if that place isn't a hellhole.
[193:16.01]Paint you to see what those redneck fucks are doing, doesn't it?
[193:19.41]As soon as I get my hands on Jackson, that all comes to an end.
[193:22.96]Merle's got pimps scattered around the hollow.
[193:26.12]Says me.
[193:28.48]Kill them, and he'll show up at the club.
[193:32.40]What is blinking over here?
[193:34.82]I'll be able to confirm that Merle's over at the club.
[193:41.19]Wait, what?
[193:46.29]What's going on, Bob the Pineapple?
[193:47.59]Thanks for the resub.
[193:49.07]Six months.
[193:49.55]Thanks, dude.
[193:52.14]How do I save the game?
[193:55.86]Does it auto-save?
[193:57.30]Somebody just told me to save the game and I just got terrified.
[194:03.64]Multiple objectives.
[194:08.75]Okay, view map tab, then view the objective panel by clicking objectives.
[194:13.86]Okay.
[194:16.26]Are these side missions?
[194:18.18]Where's the other story mission?
[194:20.08]Or am I kind of doing them both at the same time?
[194:24.96]Yeah.
[194:25.26]What's going on, Skalfot?
[194:29.31]Skalfot.
[194:31.99]Skalfot.
[194:32.85]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[194:34.37]It is autosave.
[194:34.91]Oh, that's good.
[194:41.65]So I gotta track down and kill this guy.
[194:43.47]So I could go back in there, or I could just do this.
[194:45.53]I'm gonna do this.
[194:50.36]No save run?
[194:52.32]Man, if the game didn't save and it crashed right... Seriously.
[194:56.98]If the game didn't save and I crashed or something, and you had to actually manually save, I would be so upset.
[195:06.04]Trespassing on enemy turf?
[195:07.44]What are you talking about?
[195:24.33]Nobody seems to know I did that.
[195:25.68]That's fine.
[195:28.42]You can shove it up your ass.
[195:32.36]Hold this guy right here.
[195:34.44]This guy right here.
[195:37.15]Oh my god, I'm gonna boot this guy.
[195:50.36]He shot his own friend.
[195:51.81]No more fucking around!
[196:00.95]Get out of here, quick!
[196:02.25]Oh, you're a bad guy.
[196:04.24]Wait, what?
[196:07.94]Oh, hey, what's up, Carl?
[196:12.67]Oh, did somebody just get... Oh, you got a sniper rifle.
[196:19.72]How do I go in?
[196:20.30]How do I zoom?
[196:25.56]Who's doing this?
[196:27.72]Once you've done enough damage to bring the racket down to zero, you can return to contact for more and pursue the racket.
[196:31.87]Okay.
[196:31.99]Okay.
[196:34.59]If they already wrecked Merl's prostitution racket and drawn him out, go see the voice for intel about going to Merl.
[196:38.79]Okay.
[196:41.42]Where's this last guy?
[196:42.62]He's not even on the map.
[196:48.84]It's that guy right there.
[196:49.92]Okay.
[196:51.70]I can't wait to get this guy with a fucking sniper.
[197:01.57]Good one!
[197:02.77]You almost snuck by me!
[197:06.55]Wasn't even him.
[197:17.08]I missed.
[197:17.43]Click.
[197:31.03]Money, money, money, money, money.
[197:32.41]Pick up the money, pick up the money, pick up the money.
[197:34.77]Press F to zoom.
[197:36.19]Nice.
[197:44.96]Um... Okay, I... May have... I may have done something wrong.
[198:03.39]May have.
[198:05.23]May have done a little, uh... A little thing wrong.
[198:08.60]There.
[198:10.24]Mm-hmm.
[198:14.26]Well, sometimes it's collateral damage when you're taking out bad guys.
[198:17.14]Get out!
[198:22.75]Get out, get out!
[198:34.49]Sometimes it's collateral damage when you take out the bad guys.
[198:37.51]Alright, give me my money.
[199:00.36]He sent some units of him.
[199:06.92]Alright, I'm going to turn this in, and then I'm going to call it a day for my stream today.
[199:15.57]I have some errands I need to do, and it's getting to be about 3 o'clock Eastern.
[199:19.59]I've got to get going.
[199:21.51]But thank you, RainyZ, for nine months.
[199:26.61]Thanks for providing top-notch comedy.
[199:28.93]You're a huge inspiration.
[199:29.78]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[199:30.92]Appreciate it, dude.
[199:34.11]Yeah, this was an unscheduled stream.
[199:36.94]But it did prove something to me.
[199:39.14]That I would like to continue to play Mafia 3.
[199:42.24]So, let's turn this in.
[199:45.49]And, wait.
[199:47.21]Hold on, decline.
[199:52.02]I'm going to have to finish that up.
[199:53.94]But we'll do that later.
[199:56.35]Stream your errands.
[199:58.05]I will be live, not tomorrow.
[200:00.51]Tomorrow's Monday.
[200:02.59]Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[200:04.91]At 7 p.m.
[200:05.55]Eastern.
[200:06.53]And then random another one day.
[200:08.97]It's going to be four days a week.
[200:11.27]So this is going to be just a random day.
[200:13.67]Whether it be Saturday or Sunday or who knows.
[200:16.91]It might be like Wednesday or something.
[200:19.88]I'll do another random stream a week, but Tuesday is the next stream, 7 o'clock.
[200:24.78]I will see you guys then.
[200:27.50]This was a lot of fun.
[200:28.88]I'm enjoying my time in Mafia.
[200:30.46]I think it's a pretty good game so far.
[200:33.05]But, yeah.
[200:34.19]We'll see how it goes from there.
[200:35.29]I'm probably going to play it on Tuesday.
[200:37.87]So, take care, guys.
[200:39.39]Thanks for coming out.
[200:39.93]Thanks for hanging out, everybody.
[200:42.25]And I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[200:46.19]Goodbye.
[200:46.55]Good night.
[200:46.91]Good luck.
[200:47.45]Good afternoon.
[200:49.33]And take care, everybody.
[200:50.18]See you later.
