[00:06.94]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.63]Jirba here with Chapter 2 of Nightmare House 2.
[00:16.41]And, uh... I'm just gonna go where we left off.
[00:19.43]I know a lot of you guys wanted me to do the prologue, and I...
[00:25.99]And I absolutely will do that.
[00:27.49]I apologize.
[00:28.57]I thought the prologue was just some kind of cutscene or something like that.
[00:31.28]But that actually is Nightmare House 1, I think.
[00:34.72]So, I will do that at the end of this playthrough.
[00:36.70]I'll make sure to get that done.
[00:37.92]But in the meantime, let's go.
[00:39.46]God, will you... What the hell?
[00:46.20]Enough with the jump scares in the first 11 seconds.
[00:48.87]Anything over here?
[00:50.41]Get out of the way, you stupid thing.
[00:55.02]I have a gun, at least.
[00:55.98]And I have bullets.
[00:57.38]I have... Turn off the flashlight.
[01:00.02]Radiology department.
[01:01.01]Never lose hope hospital.
[01:03.41]Oh, yeah.
[01:03.71]Never lose hope, except for the guy that got locked in there with a monster.
[01:07.79]Go!
[01:10.91]How many shots does it take to kill a zombie?
[01:15.25]Can I get in there?
[01:15.83]No.
[01:17.77]I only have ten bullets.
[01:18.75]Are you absolutely kidding me?
[01:21.71]X-ray CT scan MRI.
[01:24.07]Okay.
[01:24.27]Good to know.
[01:24.65]That's locked.
[01:25.25]This is locked.
[01:26.31]And, come on, lucky number three.
[01:27.94]They're all locked.
[01:28.84]Can I, like, break through or something?
[01:31.16]Oh, of course I can.
[01:32.00]Ha ha ha!
[01:52.84]This guy's gonna come alive, guaranteed.
[01:55.13]And, like, he's gonna start attacking me, and I'm gonna scream.
[01:58.33]Three, two, one.
[02:00.69]Nope.
[02:03.51]I could do without the flashbang in my face.
[02:09.55]Alright, this is gruesome.
[02:11.03]Oh my god.
[02:14.74]Get this guy in the wheelchair.
[02:16.14]Something horrible's gonna happen right now.
[02:19.16]I'll take an ice cold.
[02:20.06]I'll take an ice cold, Dr. Pepper.
[02:26.06]Oh, I didn't even read the tagline.
[02:27.70]So cold, it'll make you S. Bricks.
[02:31.77]I knew it was gonna happen.
[02:32.57]What am I... Can I, like, just hit him?
[02:35.97]I'm just, like, playing patty cake with this guy, like... Die, die, die!
[02:42.54]All right, danger.
[02:46.48]Admittance to authorized personnel only.
[02:49.12]Which means me.
[02:50.08]Get some... recharge my light.
[02:55.07]No!
[02:55.45]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[02:58.65]Health kit?
[03:01.86]Probably shouldn't have done that.
[03:04.86]Anything here?
[03:06.88]No.
[03:08.08]Where am I even supposed to be going?
[03:12.50]I don't like that TV.
[03:13.24]Okay.
[03:27.86]Well, can I, like, make a collect call to my mother?
[03:29.62]Hi, Ma, it's me.
[03:31.64]I just wanted to let you know that I'm in the middle of, like, a zombie-like apocalypse.
[03:35.28]And, oh, the door's open.
[03:36.08]Okay, let's go.
[03:39.19]You are now entering the radiology department.
[03:42.29]All cell phones and electronic devices must be secured in designated areas to avoid interference with vital medical equipment.
[03:50.40]Yeah, I'm breaking the vital medical.
[03:51.90]I'm like smashing the medical equipment right now.
[03:55.10]Anything even in here that I need to know about?
[03:56.56]Oh, a box of tissues.
[03:59.48]Can blow my nose.
[04:00.26]Let's just keep going.
[04:02.66]Recharge the light!
[04:06.34]Oh, I can take this away.
[04:08.98]To get in that door.
[04:11.94]Get out of here!
[04:15.08]Anything in here?
[04:15.88]Ooh!
[04:18.74]Bullets.
[04:19.82]Thank you very much.
[04:20.82]I will take those.
[04:24.48]What?
[04:24.78]What?
[04:25.04]What?
[04:25.22]What?
[04:25.34]What?
[04:25.50]What?
[04:25.76]What?
[04:27.76]What?
[04:30.89]But... But what the hell is going on?
[04:33.61]Come on here.
[04:34.31]I can't get out.
[04:38.71]I have no flashlight either.
[04:39.89]No.
[04:40.21]No.
[04:46.95]God, why did she have to do that to me?
[04:49.99]What did I ever do to her?
[04:50.87]Okay.
[04:54.53]Oh, alright.
[04:55.47]What do I do with this thing?
[04:58.04]I just drop it.
[04:58.76]Alright, let's bring this over here.
[05:01.36]Can I put this in here?
[05:04.44]Can it just fit in there?
[05:07.02]Just go in here.
[05:07.94]Go in like that hole right there.
[05:11.17]Damn it.
[05:12.99]There's gotta be a box right here somewhere then, huh?
[05:17.24]I have no idea where to bring this damn thing.
[05:19.94]I'm just carrying around this power supply.
[05:23.73]No.
[05:26.41]I have a feeling.
[05:27.05]What about in here?
[05:33.34]There's another one.
[05:35.52]What's with these power supplies?
[05:36.72]Like, what am I supposed to do with these things?
[05:38.64]What?
[05:38.98]What?
[05:39.40]What?
[05:39.74]What?
[05:46.60]God!
[05:47.61]Ow, my brain!
[05:50.49]Where did he go?
[05:51.07]I didn't just do that, did I?
[05:54.17]Can I get in here?
[05:58.31]I can.
[05:59.43]No!
[06:00.05]No, stop!
[06:01.46]It's totally black!
[06:06.36]No bullets.
[06:12.48]Man, all these things.
[06:13.28]I just don't know what to do with these things.
[06:15.66]I keep pulling out the power supplies, but I don't know what to do with them.
[06:19.04]Maybe I bring the... I think I know what to do.
[06:20.87]This one's glowing.
[06:23.09]Where is he?
[06:23.59]Where is he?
[06:26.99]Son of a... God, there's a couple of them.
[06:30.21]Go for headshots.
[06:31.09]There's three of them!
[06:36.45]Get away from me!
[06:37.27]Get away from me!
[06:40.15]Okay.
[06:41.25]Definitely have to bring this back and put that in the other one.
[06:44.23]For sure.
[06:47.75]In here, right?
[06:49.98]Get in there!
[06:50.42]Alright, what does that do?
[06:56.12]Is this operational now?
[06:57.68]It is, okay.
[07:01.83]I have no idea what I just did, but I did- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[07:08.57]It's like everything's exploding!
[07:12.10]I can't even- How am I gonna get out of this room?
[07:18.30]What the hell?
[07:21.50]Was I supposed to do that?
[07:23.57]Or did I?
[07:30.31]Jeez.
[07:33.47]Now what?
[07:35.35]Oh, damn, it blew a hole in the wall.
[07:36.97]Okay.
[07:39.57]Get up there, you bastard.
[07:40.87]Get up there!
[07:41.47]Alright, we found a new little area here.
[07:50.91]No!
[07:53.73]Where are you?
[07:56.81]I don't know where you are.
[08:00.78]Locked.
[08:02.58]Ah, I thought I just saw something.
[08:03.58]My whole body just tingled.
[08:06.12]What's going on?
[08:07.90]What's going on?
[08:08.48]Why can't I... Why can't I do anything?
[08:11.84]Was that guy in, like, a gym suit?
[08:13.22]What the hell was that?
[08:17.14]Ah, I do not like that.
[08:18.10]That guy... Oh, it's another vent.
[08:21.45]Oh great, another vent.
[08:28.39]Okay.
[08:30.90]How do I get up there?
[08:33.30]Can I like jump on something?
[08:40.52]The wheelchair?
[08:42.44]Sorry whoever that was, I needed to use it.
[08:46.14]First of all, I am going to recharge this light.
[09:05.22]That was ridiculous.
[09:11.14]Please don't just jump at me.
[09:20.42]What?
[09:21.32]How is that even possible?
[09:23.59]That's impossible.
[09:27.95]Get out of my way.
[09:28.71]I'm so glad I have a gun.
[09:33.79]Without this gun... Hey!
[09:37.02]You can't even... Okay.
[09:38.36]They can't get in.
[09:39.66]That's okay.
[09:50.57]Yeah, no, no crap.
[09:58.06]Oh.
[10:00.08]Why isn't this guy here helping with a gun or something?
[10:02.26]Go arm yourself with a machine gun and get out here.
[10:08.08]Go get an assault rifle.
[10:09.30]Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
[10:16.62]Come on now, really?
[10:19.85]Get down!
[10:23.77]Storage.
[10:26.97]No, that's the... So what did I just do?
[10:30.18]I came from here.
[10:31.08]This is the MRI machine.
[10:34.56]So I went down this way.
[10:35.68]Let me try going over here now.
[10:37.06]No, I already went over here.
[10:41.01]Where is this girl?
[10:42.15]That always means the girl is around.
[10:46.73]What the... Whoa!
[10:47.83]Hey!
[10:51.82]Well, that's not terrifying.
[10:56.32]Get me out of here.
[10:58.04]Whoa!
[11:00.51]What?
[11:05.93]Oh, man.
[11:10.65]That's gonna do it again, isn't it?
[11:14.29]What the hell is that?
[11:15.67]Where's my flashlight?
[11:16.71]Where's my flashlight?
[11:20.24]There's nowhere else to go.
[11:22.74]What is that?
[11:25.30]Is it a chair?
[11:28.64]It's a chair.
[11:34.90]Where am I?
[11:35.54]Where am I?
[11:39.18]What's going on?
[11:46.65]Okay.
[11:50.75]Where am I?
[11:51.09]Where's my light?
[11:57.05]I think I'm alive.
[11:57.69]I'm alive.
[11:58.41]That's good to know.
[12:02.59]Well, now what?
[12:05.68]Chapter 3.
[12:07.84]Alright, guys.
[12:08.82]Well, that's going to be it for Scare Saturdays.
[12:12.50]Hope you enjoyed.
[12:15.76]That thing wasn't human.
[12:16.68]That thing wasn't human.
[12:22.47]I will see you guys all next time, of course.
[12:25.56]And take care, everybody.
