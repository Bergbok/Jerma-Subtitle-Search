[00:09.16]Hey, what is happening, guys?
[00:10.46]Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[00:12.38]This is a one-life gameplay with one class, not with two classes.
[00:16.91]This is the same class.
[00:18.41]Two gameplays, one class, one life in both lives.
[00:24.20]If that makes absolutely no sense to you, you'll get it in a second.
[00:27.48]First headshot is on that heavy.
[00:28.82]This is the Huntsman Sniper on Hightower.
[00:31.62]The first one is gonna be on Hightower.
[00:33.36]The second one is going to be on... Gold Rush it is, with the default sniper rifle.
[00:38.71]So two different ends of the spectrum.
[00:40.81]Huntsman Sniper and default sniper, so you get to see both ends of the world.
[00:45.07]You get to see China, and you get to see... What's on the other end of China?
[00:49.55]America, right?
[00:50.64]America.
[00:51.22]You get to see China and America.
[00:52.74]What a terrible analogy that was.
[00:55.16]Anyways, payload race, high towers, the map we're playing on right now.
[00:59.26]And real quickly, I want to give you guys a tip on how to deal with a Huntsman.
[01:03.17]Never get that close.
[01:04.95]See how he got right up in my face?
[01:06.97]When you do that, you are increasing your head's hitbox by an astronomical amount.
[01:12.25]You never want to get that close to a Huntsman.
[01:14.56]How to deal with a Huntsman?
[01:15.92]Stay as far away from them as you can, because you will get luckily headshot in your face if you get within 5 to 10 feet of a Huntsman, you're pretty much dead.
[01:25.82]Sneaking around those boxes, luckily get the headshot on that heavy.
[01:29.16]Good thing, because these dispensers would have gone down, and the engineers, and they would have had to build it all over again, and that just sucks.
[01:35.65]So I'm glad I could protect those engineers.
[01:38.27]Long range headshot on that soldier right there, I love when that happens.
[01:42.63]If there's one thing in this game that I think is the most satisfying thing, it's either an Engineer crit from the Frontier Justice or a long range across the entire map headshot from the Huntsman.
[01:52.32]Hands down, I can't think of anything else that's more awesome than that.
[01:56.30]trying to time when that scout was going to come out of the door.
[01:58.90]I didn't time it right, but it's okay.
[02:00.26]I ended up getting away.
[02:01.42]He's coming after me, guys, and here we go again.
[02:03.84]The same thing I said before.
[02:05.40]Watch what happens here.
[02:07.14]I'm going to die, right?
[02:08.48]I get in this little corridor, and look at how close he gets.
[02:11.98]Now he's dead, and I am completely fine.
[02:14.20]That could have been the end of my life.
[02:16.30]Can't stress it enough.
[02:17.65]Never get close to a Huntsman.
[02:19.67]Pick off that pyro right there.
[02:21.31]Soldier coming around the corner.
[02:22.87]I miss.
[02:23.65]He misses.
[02:24.75]I miss.
[02:25.85]He misses.
[02:26.95]And this is where it gets a little funny.
[02:28.39]He gets too close.
[02:29.97]Get him right in his face.
[02:30.95]And now it's time for round three with that scout.
[02:34.27]Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[02:35.27]Here he is.
[02:35.87]Jumps over the arrow.
[02:37.15]Misses me with the ball.
[02:39.01]And I wonder, you could probably guess on who wins this round.
[02:41.77]Probably he was getting a little sick of getting shot in the face from two feet away.
[02:45.03]I think he learned his lesson.
[02:46.85]Good job, scout.
[02:47.67]You did a fine job.
[02:49.43]Now, before we get on to the next gameplay, I want to show you this.
[02:52.82]I was pooping my pants because of this, by the way.
[02:55.34]I think I'm going to headshot him.
[02:56.52]No, I go for the taunt kill.
[02:57.72]I get it.
[02:58.12]I can't believe it.
[03:07.51]I'm so sad.
[03:09.11]Well, well, get over it.
[03:10.05]Time to get on to the next gameplay.
[03:11.30]This is the default sniper rifle now, and the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Tribalman's Shiv.
[03:17.76]I do very, very well here.
[03:19.46]Very, very well.
[03:20.46]Unfortunately, something else ridiculous happens at the end of this gameplay.
[03:24.17]Not gonna spoil it, but I wanted to, again, poo my pants, and then shoot myself in the face, because of what happens...
[03:31.13]So I saw that spy coming around the corner there.
[03:33.15]I didn't end up going after him.
[03:34.33]I really wanted to get the headshot on that pyro.
[03:36.92]And now me and this Huntsman sniper going toe to toe.
[03:40.58]We can't seem to kill either of each other.
[03:42.70]It's really, really funny.
[03:45.48]Dude, what are you doing, spy?
[03:48.10]Why did you do that?
[03:50.38]So me and that sniper just say, forget it.
[03:52.22]I'm not going to deal with you.
[03:53.18]You're not going to deal with me.
[03:54.28]And we go our separate ways.
[03:55.58]Headshot on the engineer and his sentry goes down.
[03:58.12]Looking good, sitting pretty.
[03:59.78]Headshot on that medic and a headshot on the heavy, but it doesn't kill him.
[04:03.44]Turn around, running away.
[04:04.48]Don't get yourself killed in these situations.
[04:06.56]Try to get the upper hand.
[04:07.75]Try to get the advantage.
[04:09.03]He sees me again.
[04:09.97]I turn around.
[04:10.59]I get the headshot just in time to protect that other sniper.
[04:14.71]Now I start doing a whole lot of missing in a row.
[04:17.51]Miss that soldier with the headshot, miss that engineer with the headshot, miss his sentry, doesn't matter, it got destroyed.
[04:22.79]Anyways, this Pyro's doing the smart thing, which is, if you didn't know, he stood up, that was the mistake he made.
[04:28.80]If you don't know, ducking behind the cart is a very, very good way to protect your head of getting headshot, as long as you are right behind it.
[04:36.48]Specifically the part with the huge bubble, because I can still get you sometimes if you're right behind the cart, right to the side.
[04:43.69]But he had the right idea.
[04:45.43]That sniper was coming after me, I could tell, because he was scoped in, looking straight ahead.
[04:49.89]Get the headshot on him.
[04:51.24]Get the headshot on that pyro.
[04:52.84]Bang, bang, bang.
[04:53.68]We're doing pretty well here.
[04:55.04]Looking out for that demo spam.
[04:56.48]Trying to find a situation where I can shoot somebody in their skull cap.
[05:00.77]A spy tries to backstab me right here.
[05:02.99]I just barely get out of the way.
[05:04.77]Now I look in the obvious spy places, and that's where he was.
[05:08.15]Get the kill on him.
[05:09.21]Coming over here just to resupply my health and my ammo.
[05:12.81]This is something you never want to let slip your mind, guys, because as a sniper, I have 150 health.
[05:18.40]Usually you have 125 if you're not using the Darwin's Danger Shield.
[05:23.12]And the big problem is a lot of people forget about going to resupply their health,
[05:27.04]And you can get killed by a sniper that's countersniping you in potentially one body shot.
[05:32.25]So you always want to make sure that you have full health, or at least very close to full health, anytime you are sniping.
[05:38.91]Otherwise, like I said, you could potentially just get one shot by some dude that just goes countersniper and just murders you.
[05:45.65]Not having very much luck with the front end of the gate here So I turn around and go to the right side Ends up being a good idea because I end up getting three or four headshots in a row There's one here comes two on this heavy doesn't kill him, but it's okay watch what he does He's like no he jumps in the air trying to avoid me.
[06:02.38]I get it soldier coming around here I get the headshot on him as well which makes it three headshot kills in a row and
[06:09.09]Just briefly now, I want to talk about one thing really quickly before the end of the gameplay.
[06:13.53]Coming up to a close here in the next minute or so, I just want to let you guys know.
[06:16.75]How to play with Sniper.
[06:18.40]If you guys go back a couple of months, go back to my Uber Update video.
[06:22.26]If you watch my Uber Update video, you will see I was an atrocious sniper.
[06:28.10]I said in that gameplay, I'm a terrible sniper, I'll never be good at sniper, I'm awful.
[06:32.61]And I kind of swore off the class for a while.
[06:35.17]Just recently, the last maybe month or so,
[06:38.19]I started to really practice sniper and get much better at it and that's really what it takes guys it's all about the muscle memory it's all about keeping your arm and wrist in check and not flying all over the place just relaxing go to a couple of orange maps or go to a sniper specific map you will get better you just have to practice it takes a little bit of time take some effort that's all I have to say about that
[07:02.28]The gameplay is coming to a close here in the next 30 seconds, but the most important part of this gameplay is coming up right now in the next 15 seconds.
[07:10.49]Get ready for this, so you see the spy right here, right?
[07:12.95]Okay, I'm aware of him, I know he's there.
[07:15.55]So I come back around here, going up to the top of this corridor up here, and I figure, if he's gonna come up there, I'll see him, and I'll probably bump into him.
[07:23.95]There he is!
[07:32.51]Oh my god.
[07:34.70]Thank you all so much for watching.
[07:36.30]I really do appreciate it.
[07:37.89]I will see you all next time.
[07:39.45]Take care.
