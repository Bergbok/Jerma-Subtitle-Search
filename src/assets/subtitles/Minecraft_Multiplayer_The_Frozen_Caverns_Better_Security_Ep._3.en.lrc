[00:08.38]Yeah, there's at least two creepers out there.
[00:10.41]Yep.
[00:12.51]And they're like on top of the roof.
[00:15.55]This was a horrible place to build the house.
[00:17.35]Whose idea was this?
[00:19.32]Mine.
[00:20.12]And mine.
[00:21.52]I'm gonna build out... See where my name is, guys?
[00:24.92]Whoa, they're lagging, too.
[00:25.98]That's the worst part.
[00:27.02]Yeah.
[00:29.30]Be careful.
[00:30.52]Oh, I'm coming to rescue you.
[00:33.08]Oh no, they're coming for me.
[00:36.37]I'm digging straight up, guys.
[00:39.73]I'm trying to take care of this skeleton over here.
[00:43.73]I might be able to just lure them away.
[00:45.15]Alright, they're coming after me.
[00:46.01]Both the creepers are after me.
[00:47.76]This is our time to act.
[00:49.96]Oh my god.
[00:51.10]I don't know where to go.
[00:52.56]Towards me.
[00:53.54]Where are you?
[00:57.84]I'm digging out.
[00:59.00]Are you in the original home?
[01:00.26]Yes, right here.
[01:01.06]Get in, get in, get in.
[01:03.20]Oh, the creepers are coming.
[01:04.12]Left her.
[01:04.98]I got in.
[01:05.90]I got in the house.
[01:06.84]All right.
[01:07.46]Are you in?
[01:08.26]You too.
[01:08.94]I'm in the house.
[01:09.50]We're both in the house.
[01:10.70]Oh, my God.
[01:11.30]I'm going to get away.
[01:12.16]Oh, my God.
[01:12.70]They're pounding.
[01:14.00]See how scary that is?
[01:15.94]It's terrifying.
[01:16.70]I need food.
[01:17.30]I'm dying.
[01:17.58]Because there are creepers out there, too.
[01:19.56]You guys can't do nothing.
[01:20.88]We got food.
[01:21.52]We have food.
[01:22.06]I'm gonna defend myself, yo.
[01:24.45]Gets these creepers and... Oh, God.
[01:27.41]What happens if I open the door?
[01:28.93]Don't open the door.
[01:29.69]Alright, viewers at home.
[01:33.49]While you were away, we started a lovely weed farm.
[01:37.29]And as a result... Wow.
[01:38.53]This is...
[01:40.33]Not working.
[01:42.25]At all.
[01:43.52]Give me food.
[01:44.38]Chests do not automatically pick that stuff up.
[01:46.74]Just an FYI.
[01:49.62]I want those.
[01:50.16]What are those?
[01:51.34]This is real.
[01:52.42]Alright, you get one bread for you.
[01:56.10]Actually, two bread for you.
[01:57.10]Om nom nom nom nom nom.
[02:00.19]How's your hunger doing, Germa?
[02:03.02]It's alright.
[02:04.28]Oh, I was gonna open the door.
[02:05.48]I was just tempted to.
[02:07.30]And I need to eat?
[02:08.87]I need to, yeah, I do.
[02:10.03]Oh, actually, I got bread.
[02:13.03]Should I leave it right now?
[02:14.01]I just gave you one, so... Oh, yeah.
[02:17.67]Alright, and... It's a total bread party.
[02:22.38]Oh, no, no!
[02:23.68]I didn't mean to do that!
[02:24.76]I'll take the hit!
[02:28.26]Oh my god, I have to piss them off!
[02:30.78]Oh, wow.
[02:31.98]Come to me.
[02:33.76]Why did that just happen?
[02:35.42]Why?
[02:36.32]Oh, my God.
[02:38.15]They are so good now.
[02:40.23]What is this?
[02:41.57]Okay, I'm rebuilding the wall.
[02:44.13]I'm distracting, but they're everywhere.
[02:47.57]All right.
[02:48.39]I didn't know if you right-click, you open doors.
[02:50.75]Oh, my God.
[02:51.31]They're so good right now.
[02:54.34]Yes.
[02:54.48]I right-clicked to throw a snowball at the door, and I opened the door.
[03:00.65]Alright, I am about to make another door.
[03:02.93]I've got the wall back up.
[03:04.32]But man, we need a safer way to do this now.
[03:06.36]They are way too smart.
[03:07.78]Alright, I need to pick up all of our items.
[03:10.28]Oh my god, open up!
[03:11.38]Oh god!
[03:12.22]I'm coming.
[03:14.18]Left to come in, man.
[03:15.19]Don't worry, I'm here to the rescue.
[03:16.89]How did he get inside?
[03:20.63]He went through my doorway.
[03:23.73]He went through... Oh my, what is going on here?
[03:26.45]Wait, hold on.
[03:26.95]There's a secondary entrance now?
[03:28.95]Scepter dug up.
[03:30.76]Remember to distract them?
[03:32.44]And then a creeper dropped down?
[03:33.58]And the creeper went through his hole.
[03:36.34]In order to come down here and attack me.
[03:40.70]Luckily for me, he only needed one fist punch to die.
[03:44.06]Or else he would have exploded our chests.
[03:47.87]Masterful movement around the map.
[03:50.55]Alright, so if I right-click, I don't throw a snowball if I'm near the door.
[03:54.57]Don't do it!
[03:56.86]Here you go.
[03:58.18]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[03:59.06]We're going to fix this.
[04:00.47]Good lesson to learn.
[04:02.35]Do not right-click near a door.
[04:04.15]I got it.
[04:05.31]I should make another door for us up top here, though.
[04:08.55]Here's what I'm going to do.
[04:09.57]We're going to make a secondary door to protect the first door.
[04:15.99]You know what I'm saying?
[04:17.43]Yeah, we need one door to protect the second door.
[04:20.76]Exactly, exactly.
[04:22.66]All right, so I have a door up here now as well.
[04:25.30]Like one exit on this side and one exit on this side.
[04:28.26]You know what I'm saying?
[04:29.50]Oh, two exits?
[04:30.82]Yeah, because if they're on one side banging on the door, then we just go to the other side.
[04:35.22]Hey, hey.
[04:38.04]What if they're smarter than that?
[04:40.85]What do you do then?
[04:42.37]What a great way.
[04:43.53]That's a great way to deal with a Jehovah's Witness.
[04:48.52]Just make two doors so you can escape to the second door when they knock on the first door.
[04:52.94]Let's go.
[04:56.50]There we go.
[04:56.95]All right.
[04:58.37]Oh, wait.
[04:58.63]No, no.
[04:58.83]Don't fill that in.
[04:59.57]That's where the door is going to be.
[05:00.63]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:01.61]I cut down this tree.
[05:03.33]I think.
[05:03.79]Totally.
[05:04.11]Yeah, I did.
[05:04.81]Actually, we could have three doors.
[05:06.15]We could have one in the front and one on each side.
[05:09.34]And then it's literally impossible to get back in the house.
[05:14.96]I can't believe we really are making a door to get into the door.
[05:17.98]That's so funny.
[05:18.96]We're making three doors to get in the door.
[05:21.18]We heard you like doors, so we gave you a door with a door next to another door.
[05:27.29]Oh my god, look at all that snow.
[05:29.77]I love how I'm not doing anything.
[05:31.53]I'm just watching you guys build this house.
[05:34.09]I'm just like, what time is it?
[05:39.43]What a great voice.
[05:43.48]Okay.
[05:44.26]It's granddaddy germs.
[05:48.40]Now we just need doors.
[05:49.72]Oh no, this is off by one.
[05:50.98]Okay, I'm good now.
[05:53.24]I'm okay.
[05:55.23]Oh, did we freeze?
[05:56.07]We froze.
[05:57.45]Wait, what happened?
[05:58.19]Yeah, we froze.
[06:00.51]I need one more door.
[06:02.55]Oh, this looks really, really cool.
[06:05.95]I think we need to up the style a little bit though, so I'm gonna...
[06:10.04]I almost feel like I belong here.
[06:11.90]We'll sacrifice practicality for an uneven house.
[06:16.69]What are these shenanigans?
[06:17.73]This isn't allowed.
[06:19.55]No.
[06:22.93]If you've played Minecraft long enough... Hey, hey.
[06:26.61]Don't we have a lot of glass?
[06:28.39]Or am I just mistaken?
[06:30.77]So, hey, they can't, like, punch out windows, can they?
[06:33.77]Let's hope not.
[06:34.97]Yeah, I'm hoping not.
[06:37.01]Do we have any more glass?
[06:40.03]Yes, absolutely.
[06:41.75]I have nothing.
[06:43.19]I can't let this slide, man.
[06:44.88]Can't let it slide.
[06:47.20]I don't know what's going on.
[06:49.60]Is that thing up there supposed to be, like, the chimney or something?
[06:51.62]There's, like, a little, like, dongle up top.
[06:53.38]Do you have one more snow block?
[06:57.24]We have a snow chimney, apparently.
[06:58.32]Oh, I'm gonna add a glowstone block on top of that.
[07:01.02]I do have another snow block.
[07:02.42]Where do you need it?
[07:03.80]Right in this corner right over here.
[07:07.76]Hey, guys!
[07:11.12]Did I make you miss?
[07:12.78]No, I apparently made Jerma's mistake.
[07:15.97]Oh, right-clicking doesn't do anything.
[07:19.57]There, it's easy.
[07:20.61]See, I think it's easy.
[07:21.67]I am helping.
[07:24.03]And you know what?
[07:25.61]We can do...
[07:27.59]How did you even get up there?
