[00:02.27]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:03.61]Jerma here with a pre-Thanksgiving live commentary.
[00:07.93]I just want to say from the bottom of my heart, if you celebrate Thanksgiving, if you live in the United States, or if you are overseas somewhere but you still happen to celebrate Thanksgiving, then happy Thanksgiving.
[00:18.40]I hope you have a nice, safe holiday, everybody.
[00:20.89]Going to do a quick live commentary like I'm saying.
[00:23.25]Oh, goodness.
[00:26.15]I thought I was going to kill him.
[00:27.56]But yeah, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:29.86]And I got some crazy, crazy things planned for the holiday season.
[00:34.52]Not going to tell you what I'm doing yet.
[00:36.64]It's involving a lot of insanity.
[00:38.78]I'll get into that in a later video, but expect a crazy Christmas video at some point in the very near future.
[00:45.90]So what do you say?
[00:46.80]Let's get sea.
[00:49.21]Let's get sea.
[00:51.79]Playing as the Pyro with the Reserve Shooter.
[00:54.93]And the Degreaser, along with the Powerjack.
[00:59.48]Pretty much default setup for me.
[01:01.38]Except the Reserve Shooter, I don't really use it a whole lot.
[01:03.56]Oh, I was trying to sneak behind everybody.
[01:05.24]What the hell was I doing?
[01:07.92]I was talking and just ran around everybody like an idiot.
[01:15.42]But yeah, I'm going to fill up on so much turkey.
[01:18.14]I'm going to eat a ton of turkey sandwiches the next day.
[01:21.40]Should be a hell of a good time.
[01:24.05]Me and my family, we go up to New Hampshire.
[01:27.49]And when we go there, we get a big hall rented out.
[01:29.69]Like, a big hall is rented out for us.
[01:30.95]A ton of our family goes there every year.
[01:33.99]It's pretty cool.
[01:34.77]Pretty interesting.
[01:35.79]I got a big family, guys, so... We can't really have Christmas and, like, Thanksgiving at one little place.
[01:42.53]Just because the family is so enormous.
[01:45.93]I wanna get... Oh, man.
[01:47.15]Oh, this could be epic right here.
[01:48.27]This could be epic.
[01:50.72]Get out of here.
[01:51.28]I don't want you up here.
[01:52.94]Oh, there's a sentry up here.
[01:55.18]Oh, I should have known.
[01:57.01]I should have known.
[01:57.89]That's what I get.
[02:02.05]You know, I'm going to change to Demoman because that's just not going to happen as a pyro.
[02:09.45]Give me my... There we go.
[02:12.60]Alright, I'll do this right here.
[02:13.58]Ready?
[02:13.80]You guys ready?
[02:15.60]If I don't do this right here, then something's wrong.
[02:18.58]Okay.
[02:18.78]Okay.
[02:19.89]I gotta go the other way.
[02:22.27]Oh, no, no, no.
[02:24.54]Gotta go around the other direction.
[02:29.16]Here we go, who'd I get?
[02:30.88]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[02:34.68]Man, they're all pouring in here.
[02:38.83]Oh, come on now.
[02:42.43]Come on now.
[02:48.11]How did that not hit him?
[02:49.96]I was gonna say, Jesus.
[02:52.38]Jesus crimity.
[02:56.56]I need... I need a medic.
[03:01.24]Oh, Kritzkrieg, look out.
[03:06.46]I'm dead.
[03:07.44]I'm so dead.
[03:09.03]Where did these guys all come from?
[03:10.11]They're all just pouring into this one area.
[03:14.31]No, we have two medics.
[03:16.61]What's going on here?
[03:19.47]What is the deal?
[03:23.01]This is Gravel Pit, if you did not know.
[03:25.99]If you were unaware of where we were playing.
[03:29.55]Where we were playing, not where we were playing.
[03:35.91]Oh, come on.
[03:37.67]At least I got the teleporter.
[03:38.83]That's one thing.
[03:40.13]That's one good thing.
[03:40.97]Alright.
[03:46.20]If I can get even close to that
[03:49.35]And I could probably get something done.
[03:51.05]I just need to overheal.
[03:53.79]Big time.
[03:59.10]Oh, no.
[04:01.92]Demoman.
[04:03.68]Got him.
[04:06.69]Alright, this is just... We have two medics.
[04:10.07]Where are they?
[04:12.35]Where are these two mysterious medics that are just nowhere to be found?
[04:20.04]Somebody's on the point.
[04:20.74]Oh, we might win.
[04:25.62]Come on.
[04:26.24]I'm just going to jump up there.
[04:29.89]No!
[04:37.77]Oh, that was great.
[04:41.74]I just launched like 10,000 feet in the air.
[04:45.58]God, jeez.
[04:50.51]Spy.
[04:51.05]No, we can't lose.
[04:57.66]Oh, get him.
[04:59.62]Nice shot.
[05:01.72]What?
[05:04.56]Where is this medic?
[05:06.18]I haven't seen the medic one time.
[05:09.39]Where is this guy?
[05:10.25]I'm going this way.
[05:18.27]I'm not going that way.
[05:19.01]I'm going to get myself killed.
[05:28.12]Oh, did I make it?
[05:30.07]I did, but not really.
[05:32.53]I was just completely silent right there.
[05:34.17]That was just try-hard mode.
[05:35.51]Wicked bad.
[05:36.65]Too bad it didn't work.
[05:38.11]We're definitely going to lose.
[05:39.63]This is it.
[05:41.57]That's all she wrote.
[05:44.56]So yeah, thank you guys.
[05:45.78]Oh, look at these... What?
[05:48.58]What is going on here?
[05:51.11]Anyways, we lose.
[05:54.81]But thanks everybody so much for watching.
[05:56.87]I wanted to make this quick video just to get it out here.
[05:59.18]And wish you guys a happy Thanksgiving.
[06:01.44]And I wish you the best.
[06:02.68]And stay safe, guys.
[06:04.40]Take care, everybody.
