[00:06.66]Alright, let's take a look here.
[00:11.01]I can swing left.
[00:12.77]I can swing right.
[00:14.43]I can swing down.
[00:15.99]Can I swing up?
[00:17.67]Not really.
[00:19.29]But this is extremely awkward.
[00:27.48]What is my guy doing right now?
[00:33.02]Who is winning this fight?
[00:34.18]Did he just knock it out of my hand?
[00:40.90]Can I get a stick?
[00:41.48]Oh, a stick.
[00:45.52]Give me the stick.
[00:46.08]Give me the stick.
[00:47.22]Give me the stick.
[00:49.54]Have I not been spotted?
[00:53.06]These guys aren't hostile.
[00:56.14]Oh, okay, cool.
[00:56.88]These guys are not hostile.
[00:58.94]Excellent.
[01:01.88]Now they are.
[01:04.49]Should I run from this?
[01:05.37]I feel like I need to run.
[01:06.27]And not like... Alright, let's do it.
[01:09.63]I'm almost dead.
[01:11.59]I'm dead again.
[01:14.73]Holy shit.
[01:16.85]Just be on your way, game.
[01:18.18]I can't die here.
[01:20.36]If I die here, I'm going to be extremely upset.
[01:23.88]Considering... Shit.
[01:26.74]Do I attack this guy?
[01:27.74]I kind of have to.
[01:28.30]He's looking at me weird.
[01:29.04]Alright, I gotta ready my weapon.
[01:31.16]Here he comes.
[01:33.42]Come on.
[01:34.70]Come on.
[01:35.60]I missed.
[01:39.06]I missed and I'm gonna die for it.
[01:44.44]God damn it!
[01:50.03]I don't know what I did.
[01:51.47]I did something wrong.
[01:54.63]I feel like I'm a little kid in a Halloween costume his mother made for him.
[01:59.11]Oh, sure, honey.
[02:00.17]You're a Power Ranger.
[02:01.33]Yeah, you are.
[02:02.15]I promise.
[02:03.90]You're not a box.
[02:05.88]Did the other kids make fun of you?
[02:10.64]Keep moving.
[02:14.17]Keep going.
[02:18.63]Hello.
[02:21.03]This might be a bad time, but can you give me some directions out of here?
[02:25.38]I'm kind of lost and I can't see because there's a box on my head.
[02:28.76]But if you could lead me out.
[02:30.56]Ow, my hand.
[02:34.00]I don't even think he can hurt me.
[02:42.48]He can't hit me!
[02:45.34]You have never seen my impenetrable box fort like this before.
[02:50.12]I'm gonna sit here until this guy hurts me.
[02:56.20]Oh, he's getting through.
[02:57.52]I wonder, can I swing back?
[03:04.31]Let's see if I can fight back.
[03:05.41]I don't think so.
[03:11.66]I can't fight back.
[03:17.86]Oh wait, he's getting around.
[03:18.84]Hey, cut it out!
[03:22.25]Just go, run, run!
[03:32.08]Stop running into walls, please.
[03:34.46]And just escape.
[03:36.34]Escape this horrible castle.
[03:39.72]Get away from me.
[03:41.44]You cretin.
[03:42.36]Jesus.
[03:45.53]No!
[03:49.59]I am going to club this guy.
[03:50.79]Just wait till this guy makes his way around this corner.
[03:53.81]I'm going to smash this guy's skull in.
[03:57.37]He's gonna wish he was never born.
[03:59.87]But let's just pretend like we don't wanna hurt this guy.
[04:02.95]And he's gonna keep walking.
[04:05.67]No, he's not.
[04:06.17]Here we go.
[04:08.11]You wanna see how I do things?
[04:12.13]Oh my god, I can't even do it.
[04:13.61]I'm already dead.
[04:17.47]I wanted to sledgehammer the guy.
[04:18.87]And the guy was holding it like a pool cue for a second.
[04:22.45]And he didn't even reach back.
[04:23.60]I'm trying to do like the swing with the physics.
[04:27.83]I forgot to put clothes on before I came into the arena.
[04:30.25]I've got like a big diaper on.
[04:35.89]Oh, come on.
[04:39.89]Get away from the wall.
[04:41.85]Get away from the wall.
[04:43.77]Alright, go back.
[04:45.57]Right in the... Nice.
[04:51.71]Okay, I'm just turning into the Star Wars kid at this point.
[04:56.09]That old, like, internet video.
[04:59.51]I won!
[04:59.89]What the hell?
[05:14.70]I haven't beaten this guy.
[05:16.70]I have not beaten this guy.
[05:19.54]This guy's got the shield.
[05:22.02]Shit!
[05:23.72]My face got stuck in his shield.
[05:25.12]That's horse shit.
[05:28.68]Bad.
[05:32.05]Oh, come on.
[05:32.97]What the fuck was that?
[05:40.22]Protect yourself.
[05:41.57]Damn it.
[05:42.51]Oh, this game is so hard.
