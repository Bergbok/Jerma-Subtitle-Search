[00:36.58]Yeah, it's a Wednesday stream.
[00:39.51]Gotta clear the, uh, the waves, you know.
[00:42.55]A lot of people don't know this, but it's, you don't have, you know, your vocal cords are made up of a series of waves.
[00:49.69]And if you don't, like, fucking clear your throat, you end up with some salt water in there.
[00:53.91]You're gonna have a problem.
[00:57.89]what the fuck am I saying all right you know what just happened this is what I'm hearing hold on I'm gonna mute this I'm hearing this really loud loudly in my ear this like music the menu music just like got into my head and I couldn't even fucking talk so I just said the first like three words after like I started talking um
[01:19.08]There's a word for that.
[01:20.08]I forget what it is.
[01:20.86]When your brain can't talk and process information at the same time... They actually used to do it... If you put on headphones and you hear yourself talk... Like a quarter of a second after you say words... You're like... And you lock up.
[01:38.91]That's pretty much what just happened.
[01:40.81]It's got a very specific name.
[01:43.00]I don't know what the hell it is.
[01:46.30]It's called being dumb.
[01:47.46]Well, no, actually, no, no, you fucking dickhead.
[01:49.82]It ain't.
[01:50.98]You fucking dickhead.
[01:52.32]It ain't.
[01:59.37]No, you fucking deckhead.
[02:01.25]D-E-C-K-H-E-A-D.
[02:11.55]Deckhead.
[02:20.12]You fucking deckhead.
[02:22.36]Speech jammer.
[02:23.08]There you go.
[02:23.44]There it is.
[02:23.80]Somebody's got it.
[02:24.77]It's a speech jammer.
[02:28.37]That's what it is.
[02:29.01]It's speech jammer.
[02:30.09]Go look it up and try it.
[02:30.97]It's actually like really, really weird.
[02:34.19]But like hearing like myself and like the music play at the same time is a speech jam.
[02:39.65]All right, let's go.
[02:40.17]We're going to finish Red Faction Guerrilla tonight.
[02:42.73]I'm going to try to finish it at least.
[02:46.07]Let's see if that's possible.
[02:49.11]What a good Super Mario reference.
[02:51.93]Do a speech jammer stream?
[02:54.33]I could never do that.
[02:55.79]No way.
[03:00.58]Fucking old man eats shit.
[03:02.10]Damn.
[03:04.36]You guys are fucking savage tonight.
[03:05.98]Alright, let me just make a tweet.
[03:16.25]And give me one second.
[03:36.40]All right, let's move this.
[03:41.28]Here, here.
[03:48.00]Thank you.
[03:48.54]Thank you, Jason Darson, for the 10 bucks.
[03:50.66]They say deckhead.
[03:53.90]Well, thank you, Jason Darson.
[03:55.26]Thank you, you fellow fucking deckhead.
[03:57.46]I got the tweet out.
[04:02.45]Let's put this in the right spot.
[04:05.00]So I'm going to try to finish the game tonight.
[04:09.74]And try is the right word there.
[04:14.36]Not windowed.
[04:14.96]Uh-huh.
[04:19.83]Not windowed.
[04:20.53]There it is.
[04:21.99]I accept.
[04:23.05]Load game.
[04:23.69]I don't know how much there is left to do.
[04:28.69]How much do we got left?
[04:29.41]What do you think?
[04:34.73]I know I just unlocked the, uh, the jetpack, so we're gonna have to take a look at that.
[04:40.15]Any tips on getting a mosquito out of your room?
[04:42.91]Uh, breathe out.
[04:45.17]Like, just, like, exhale.
[04:48.78]Like, mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide.
[04:53.88]And then just fucking crush it in your hands right in front of your face.
[04:56.30]Uh, that's true, by the way.
[05:01.84]What do we got?
[05:03.21]Jetpack is $6.50. $6.50.
[05:09.07]With a solid three or four hours, possibly five.
[05:12.41]Well.
[05:14.70]Oh, fucking 8 p.m., you deckhead.
[05:19.88]Bill Nye.
[05:22.38]The first part is true.
[05:23.54]It is.
[05:27.30]I don't spout nonsense to you guys.
[05:31.56]Well, I don't have enough for anything.
[05:32.40]Actually, I have enough for... More remote charges.
[05:37.30]Mm.
[05:41.52]Mosquito doctor kills mosquitoes only when they're a nuisance.
[05:47.40]So, where are we going?
[05:48.94]Yeah, welcome to this off-scheduled Wednesday stream.
[05:53.89]I do want to try to complete this, but I don't think I want to give it another full, like, scheduled stream.
[05:59.35]Because there's at least, like, five or six games that I, like, want to play that I haven't had a chance to play.
[06:04.69]So, looks like we're going over here.
[06:08.07]So, let's fast travel with the letter Y. By the way, I saw all the shit everyone was giving me about the letter Y.
[06:15.84]Like, zoom in on that, okay?
[06:18.44]Like, everyone was giving me shit.
[06:20.28]Just get, dude, fucking take, if you're on an iPad right now, if you are on like a tablet, take your two fingers and spread.
[06:25.54]Just spread into that Y, you know what I mean?
[06:27.74]And you tell me that that's not like potentially a V. I was getting a lot of shit for this.
[06:33.59]Spread it.
[06:34.11]Just spread your fingers.
[06:35.73]And look at it.
[06:40.75]Spread it.
[06:44.88]Alright, let's get in this guy.
[06:46.60]Watch out for the fucking minigun man.
[06:51.84]Thank you, JKLaser, for the $5.
[06:54.00]Don't kill the mosquito, he's a doctor.
[06:58.34]Oh.
[06:59.18]The doctor mosquito is not actually a mosquito.
[07:04.15]He's a medical professional that handles mosquitoes.
[07:10.29]We're going this way.
[07:15.18]Do a stream of Borderlands 2.
[07:17.88]No, I don't... I don't like Borderlands.
[07:20.64]I really don't.
[07:21.75]I hate to be the Debbie Downer.
[07:24.79]Every other stream is like... I talk about a popular video game that I don't like.
[07:29.87]I feel like... You know, I don't even like this game.
[07:33.37]But honestly... I don't like Borderlands.
[07:44.22]How did...
[07:48.51]Did I go through the- I went through the windshield.
[07:52.09]I actually, like, went through the windshield.
[07:53.55]Get over here.
[08:01.28]What is this?
[08:01.66]Oh, secret!
[08:03.74]I found a fucking secret!
[08:06.94]Everyone quiet.
[08:07.76]Listen.
[08:08.80]Okay, well.
[08:19.27]One more radio tag for the MOAB location.
[08:21.84]I feel like we have to find the MOAB before I don't play this game ever again.
[08:33.22]No, borderlands to... Wait a minute.
[08:35.95]Isn't that my car?
[08:37.59]No.
[08:37.87]Oh, they're just having trouble.
[08:39.41]Alright, I'll give you a boost.
[08:41.31]As a fellow neighbor.
[08:43.83]Let me help you out here, neighbor.
[08:46.33]Alright, you didn't even need my help.
[08:47.92]It's okay.
[08:52.46]Excuse me, neighbor.
[08:56.63]Fuck you, neighbor.
[08:58.01]Next time return my sugar, motherfucker.
[09:02.69]Oh.
[09:12.59]Come on.
[09:15.02]Well, I tried.
[09:23.56]We gotta go this way.
[09:26.26]That was a $10 neighbor joke?
[09:28.10]Kind of was.
[09:29.74]I do want to get... I've been passing these up.
[09:31.98]And I feel like that's a detriment to my character progression.
[09:36.56]Alright.
[09:38.60]Thank you, MySonics.
[09:41.52]Myconics.
[09:42.60]Hey, Dermot, have you played Armed and Delirious?
[09:46.26]You haven't played weird 90s video games until you've played Armed and Delirious.
[09:52.26]No, I mean, we're taking a little break from my, here's the thing.
[09:55.88]Like, for a while there, up until, like, two weeks ago, we were on a kick of just, like, fucking 90s, like, shit video games.
[10:04.64]And I love that stuff, right?
[10:06.58]I love playing, like, the odd, fucked up, random-ass games.
[10:11.00]But, you know, sometimes, sometimes you gotta do, like, you gotta play, like, a modern video game sometimes.
[10:19.32]But thank you, Miconics, for the bits.
[10:21.24]And also, JKLaser, thank you for the $5, even though I did read your mosquito quote.
[10:26.68]VOOM, thanks for the bits.
[10:27.58]And they say, can you make fart noises with your mouth?
[10:29.68]I mean, I can.
[10:31.36]You didn't ask me to do it, you asked me if I could do it.
[10:33.97]And the answer is yes, and I'm not going to do it.
[10:36.09]But we're going to get all these.
[10:37.07]We're going to get all these over here.
[10:43.13]Is it a stupid modern video game?
[10:44.59]Well, I mean, you tell me.
[10:47.68]Like, this is like a... When did this come out?
[10:49.38]Like, fucking 2008?
[10:50.54]2009?
[10:51.74]I would classify a, like, modern game something that came out within the last... Like, within the last, like, five to eight years.
[11:02.75]I consider, like, a quote, like, modern game.
[11:06.53]If it was on, like, Xbox 360, potentially, like, it's kind of, like, a more modern game.
[11:13.30]Do it or we're gonna leave.
[11:14.42]What do you mean, do it or we leave?
[11:20.90]If I don't make a fart noise with my mouth, you guys are going to leave.
[11:25.94]Are we that childish?
[11:27.60]We can't be that childish, right?
[11:29.80]Like, when you come to, like, my livestream, you expect, like, fart noises.
[11:32.90]Like, think about that.
[11:33.58]Like, go over that.
[11:35.32]Let's go over this.
[11:37.12]Fart noises or we leave.
[11:39.59]That's the kind of entertainment that you're looking for.
[11:45.41]Well, let's just disintegrate these guys and then steal their stuff.
[11:53.64]What was that?
[11:54.76]More of them.
[11:55.42]Um... No, I don't want this.
[12:02.20]There was... Jumping was unnecessary, by the way.
[12:05.10]But I had to do it.
[12:06.74]Fart noise.
[12:07.36]No, this is like... We don't do fart noises on an off-scheduled stream.
[12:11.34]You know what I mean?
[12:13.22]Like, all the comedy jokes, all the bits, all, like, the funny shit, right?
[12:16.77]In quotes.
[12:17.27]I'm putting those in quotes.
[12:18.45]That's for a scheduled stream.
[12:19.49]This is like a relax and play video games off-scheduled stream.
[12:28.91]Fucking do it.
[12:29.73]Okay, my god.
[12:30.81]Fine.
[12:31.17]Here you go.
[12:34.22]I can't believe I'm gonna fucking do this.
[12:37.60]I can't believe I'm about to do this.
[12:39.82]I'm doing this to make everybody stop saying this, but isn't that worse?
[12:47.67]I'll do it.
[12:48.01]Hold on.

[14:58.54]This is a multiplayer destruction derby where we have to race.
[15:04.51]Somebody... And you gave me $100 for that?
[15:06.59]I just got $100 for doing that.
[15:08.71]No, we shouldn't be encouraging that type of low effort content.

[18:24.41]It's like a power core.
[18:25.41]Oh, I have to... Of course, I have to destroy this.
[18:37.32]I was about to say that was anticlimactic.
[18:45.66]I was about to be really disappointed.

[21:35.05]Get out the back door.
[21:36.35]It'll be easy.
[21:42.69]Once the whole thing comes down, then I'll have a good opportunity to get over there.
[21:49.45]Alright, that was pretty sick.
[21:50.57]One of my favorite things about this game is how visceral the melee is.
[21:53.99]It's perfect.
[21:55.90]Alright, now I can get up.
[22:03.22]And right through it.
[22:07.05]You're really fucking up my action sequence here, dude.

[22:26.36]These fucking cubes.
[22:36.33]Like, how much more... What's left?

[23:06.40]Alright, let's go this way.
[23:11.80]I gotta get in the car.
[23:13.18]It's gonna explode, but I need at least a small amount of protection.
[23:18.51]It's almost like they're made to be tough.
[23:21.43]Yeah, but what about like the full-on buildings?
[23:28.00]Come on, give me this.
[23:38.90]So, we're gonna try...
[23:46.82]Alright, the core is in here.
[23:47.88]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[23:49.30]Don't.
[23:49.56]Be careful.
[23:50.00]Just shoot it up from the outside.
[23:51.94]Just get up there and shoot it from the outside.
[23:53.52]Come on.
[23:56.89]Come on.
[23:57.29]I'm hitting it.
[23:57.81]I'm hitting it.

[24:27.00]Oh, shit.

[25:12.03]There's only three cores in this computer?
[25:13.65]I can tell I'm getting kind of annoyed at that, like, very loud sound that keeps playing.
[25:25.29]That, like... How much health does this have?
[25:34.02]How do I shut that thing up?
[25:39.18]Why are your blockades so good?
[25:44.18]Holy shit, man, like, like this, I gotta, I have to just drive straight into this guy.
[25:51.25]No, just go in the building.
[25:52.42]In the building.
[25:53.92]The door hit me.
[25:54.76]The door hit me in the head.
[25:58.08]Let them kill their own building, because they're fucking idiots.
[26:12.51]There we go.
[26:14.25]Almost done.
[26:14.87]Couple more.
[26:19.61]Oh, really?
[26:21.85]Oh!
[26:24.29]Oh, you're so close.

[26:30.98]Holy fuck.
[26:39.63]What?
[26:40.03]I can't break that shit?
[26:46.91]This thing's made out of pure titanium, apparently.
[26:50.77]There it goes.
[26:51.21]12%.
[26:51.23]12%.
[26:54.34]Alright, let's just start shooting shit.
[27:08.84]There it goes.
[27:09.90]One more.
[27:11.30]Goodbye!
[27:14.53]This whole thing's gonna collapse in five seconds.
[27:17.01]It's that thing shooting!
[27:19.57]Holy shit, can I... I don't think I can do anything about that.
[27:23.29]Alright, let's go.
[27:31.34]Each room.
[27:33.00]Every room, every side.
[27:41.21]And there she goes.
[27:47.20]Okay, well, I'm scared to go over there now.
[27:49.02]There's too many people over there.
[27:50.52]There's too many things happening over there.
[27:55.82]There is an ammo crate, though.
[27:57.14]That's a big deal.
[27:59.02]That's a big fucking deal.
[28:04.55]Move.
[28:05.69]Move.
[28:15.42]This whole place is going to come down.
[28:16.82]This is... There's so much pressure right now just because of how loud this is in my brain.
[28:24.72]Actually, I'm not sure I want to get rid of this right now.
[28:30.89]This is like my only cover.
[28:34.69]I need a car too.
[28:35.67]Alright, I'm going to just say fuck this place.
[28:38.63]It'll come down eventually.
[28:41.18]I need a car though.
[28:42.04]Because there's no way I'm getting through that.
[28:43.76]Sneak up behind these guys, bash somebody's brains in.
[28:49.66]Get in this.
[28:54.05]You could get in the car.
[28:55.65]It would be swell if you got in.
[29:01.13]You fucking stupid ass car.
[29:03.41]Why is this here?
[29:04.69]Why is that?
[29:05.49]I put it there and I'm angry at me putting it there.
[29:09.59]This is too many people.
[29:16.18]All the loud noises!
[29:25.94]Die!
[29:27.50]Just break it!
[29:28.08]I don't even want to be able to use it.
[29:29.38]I don't even want to use it.
[29:36.76]This is just intensity, the video game.
[29:43.00]Everything's just intense.
[29:43.95]I need to get in here.
[29:51.83]Get me in here.
[29:52.79]Oh, fuck it.
[29:53.15]The core's right there.
[29:53.93]Just break this.
[30:00.30]Ooh!
[30:01.14]Ugh.
[30:03.30]Alright, that's it.
[30:06.28]Only one more core.
[30:08.40]I need another car, I think.
[30:10.30]I think I need another car.
[30:12.54]There's so many people over there.
[30:13.76]I gotta go up there.
[30:16.78]Oh, yi-yi.
[30:24.99]We're gonna have to, like, metal... We're gonna have to, like, GTA this.
[30:32.67]Alright, that guy does, like, pancake.
[30:34.07]That's fine.
[30:40.25]Alright, and now go.
[30:47.27]Pick it up.
[30:48.17]Mm-hmm.
[30:50.57]Watch it.
[30:51.45]I need full health.
[30:54.82]Come on, heal up.
[30:58.46]I really desperately want a car, but I don't think that's gonna happen.
[31:02.80]Fuck this guy.
[31:03.34]I can get it on the way out.
[31:09.50]This one dumbass is the thing that caused me all the problems.
[31:14.35]Look at all this.
[31:21.93]That's easy.
[31:22.59]It's that easy.
[31:25.92]That easy, folks.
[31:30.58]Got it.
[31:35.93]Don't.
[31:36.45]Do not!
[31:42.37]DO NOT!
[31:43.51]DO NOT!
[31:44.59]DO NOT!
[31:45.21]Okay.
[31:48.73]Uh, free fire zone has been liberated.
[32:10.51]That was total panic, dude.
[32:12.13]I had like one health.
[32:18.79]Thermobaric rocket unlocked.
[32:22.37]Thermobaric, thermobaric, whatever.
[32:25.63]And now I can... I don't even know what hit me.
[32:30.56]Something hit me like right in the head that it wasn't even on the screen.
[32:38.22]Don't ask me what the hell that was.
[32:40.45]I can't give you an answer.
[32:45.51]EDF supply crate.
[32:47.67]Slowly make our way back down and around.
[32:49.25]Has this whole place been completely liberated, I guess?
[32:52.94]Apparently.
[33:00.76]Lots of these crates.
[33:06.26]PDX fly crates.
[33:07.76]Do these give more than the ores?
[33:15.35]The ore refinery?
[33:16.63]Not refinery.
[33:18.55]The mines?
[33:24.13]Do not do.
[33:25.25]That's right.
[33:25.67]Do not do.
[33:31.80]What's next?
[33:34.51]Alright, we have up here to do.
[33:37.88]Let's just make our way up.
[33:43.36]What is this roundabout way to do this?
[33:46.98]What?
[33:49.65]Is this GPS directions or is this a Mario Kart track?
[33:55.03]I'm not sure.
[33:58.13]Where's the chain chomp that's going to appear right here and go across?
[34:04.96]All right.
[34:12.30]Minus two.
[34:13.14]That wasn't a joke.
[34:13.84]That was an observation.
[34:19.57]Well, I knew that was going to happen.
[34:23.89]Let's make our way over there.
[34:24.85]One more crate.
[34:26.37]Well, that was just a pretend crate.
[34:28.09]That was a fake set from like the 40s.
[34:32.05]Got him with the Mario reference.
[34:33.17]Yeah.
[34:36.21]Sometimes you gotta get a good Mario reference.
[34:41.18]Excellent observational comedy.
[34:45.34]Come on.
[34:51.12]I am missing a lot of these crates.
[34:52.40]Did you say Mario's six feet tall?
[34:58.83]No, he is not.
[35:00.31]Mario is like three feet tall.
[35:04.74]Super Mario is like two and a half feet tall.
[35:09.95]Where do you get the idea that he's six feet tall?
[35:22.84]German equals Mario.
[35:26.02]You guys can do better than that.
[35:27.48]You guys can do better than that at this point.
[35:35.19]There's other shit to say.
[35:36.45]This is the dumb shit that I've ever done in my life.
[35:47.66]Let's turn him into popcorn and let's go.
[35:51.86]You guys could do better.
[35:54.86]Come on, don't take the easy way out.
[35:57.20]Lay it into me.
[35:58.00]Lay into me for real.
[36:00.17]It's too easy.
[36:02.46]Minus two, guys.
[36:04.16]Hey, no, no, no, no.
[36:04.78]Minus ten.
[36:08.64]You wanna minus two me all the time?
[36:10.53]Well, get minus ten.
[36:11.65]Oh, no.
[36:30.06]There was nudity in this chat, I think.
[36:34.90]Thank you, purple, for the bits.
[36:36.78]Too much purple.
[36:37.76]We do need to step outside.
[36:39.40]Do we need to step outside, Jeremy?
[36:41.97]No, we're fine.
[36:42.61]Don't worry.
[36:42.95]Everything's going to be fine.
[36:44.55]Thank you.
[36:47.43]Myconics, you may be hungry for pizza.
[36:48.87]I want to try Dr. Oaker.
[36:50.27]I actually have a Dr. Oaker story for you guys.
[36:55.66]But Myconics, thanks for the bits.
[36:58.37]You don't know where to buy it in Tennessee.
[36:59.81]Well, interestingly enough, Dr. Okra's is no longer even sold in my supermarket anymore.
[37:08.00]I don't know why.
[37:09.70]You cannot get Dr. Okra's pizza anymore.
[37:12.76]Went to the grocery store recently, and I'm just going to the pizza aisle.
[37:16.81]And I see all the dog shit brands.
[37:18.75]First of all,
[37:21.60]What is it?
[37:22.70]What is it with everybody's like fucking hard-on with like DiGiorno's and like... DiGiorno's like sucks.
[37:29.52]DiGiorno's is like the McDonald's of frozen pizzas.
[37:33.20]It's not that good.
[37:34.29]It's like not great.
[37:35.37]It's like okay.
[37:38.83]But that's everywhere.
[37:40.19]DiGiorno's is everywhere.
[37:43.61]Why?
[37:47.11]Why is it everywhere?
[37:50.50]Because they put ads on TV where somebody tells you it's not delivery, it's DiGiorno?
[37:54.53]Yeah, of course it's not delivery.
[37:56.01]Most, like, shitty pizza delivery places make bad pizzas, too.
[38:01.41]Saying that your pizza is better than Domino's?
[38:04.51]I mean, like, really?
[38:06.63]Oh, yeah, guys, buy DiGiorno's.
[38:08.62]I promise it's better than, like, Papa John's.
[38:12.28]That's not a whole lot of confidence.
[38:17.26]Live taste test.
[38:25.13]You're in this fucking property.
[38:29.14]See, I'm gonna pick that up.
[38:31.20]Domino's is bad.
[38:31.98]I'm not saying that Domino's is, like, bad.
[38:35.16]I'm just saying that, like, you're comparing how great your pizza is next to, like, all the chain pizzas.
[38:43.19]I can make you guys a hamburger and tell you, hey, that's probably gonna taste better than McDonald's.
[38:48.05]It probably will.
[38:50.32]You know, I can make you like a chicken sandwich and be like, hey dude, check out my fucking chicken sandwich I just made you.
[38:56.06]It's probably better than McDonald's.
[38:59.16]What?
[39:00.62]You're gonna be like, uh, that's like what, that's your like denomination there is McDonald's?
[39:12.80]You bet Jerm is a shit cook?
[39:14.00]Oh, you don't know me very well.
[39:16.56]You think I'm a shitty cook?
[39:17.42]You have no idea who you're dealing with.
[39:28.41]Can I take out this bridge?
[39:33.65]Cooking stream.
[39:36.13]No, guys, you have no idea.
[39:40.76]What you are talking about.
[39:45.32]You think my food is bad?
[39:46.50]You have no idea how many people I've accidentally poisoned with raw food.
[39:52.08]And how many people have visibly been upset when I hand them food.
[39:56.20]You have no idea!
[39:58.65]The amount of times that I've lost friendships over somebody telling me that they were disgusted by my food and that I was trying to hurt them.
[40:08.28]I wasn't trying to hurt them.
[40:12.78]Here's how I make every meal, guys.
[40:14.20]I put the oven on at 350.
[40:17.75]And, uh... Hold on, we gotta cancel this.
[40:21.15]I put... You put... Take any piece of food.
[40:23.25]You get a piece of fish, a steak.
[40:25.75]Like, just go buy, like, a nice expensive steak.
[40:27.54]$3.50 on the oven.
[40:29.58]Put it into a cast iron pan.
[40:31.24]Put it in the oven at $3.50 for, like, two hours.
[40:34.58]Take it out.
[40:35.08]It's gonna look, like, gray and shitty.
[40:36.72]That's how you... It's cooked.
[40:38.16]It's good.
[40:41.82]Anything.
[40:42.67]Like, macaroni.
[40:43.13]Like, take spaghetti...
[40:46.28]Put it into cast iron pan.
[40:48.04]Put it in the oven at 350 for like 45 minutes.
[40:51.28]With a little bit of water in there.
[40:52.74]Done.
[40:59.46]By the way, don't do any of this.
[41:01.24]I don't want anyone to get sick.
[41:02.50]Do not try that at home.
[41:09.07]It's a joke.
[41:14.39]You don't even need oil.
[41:15.57]Cast iron is good.
[41:16.59]What the fuck was that?
[41:17.17]Oh, we get a sniping mission.
[41:18.17]Alright, we get a sniping mission.
[41:19.11]Alright.
[41:42.28]Do I need to get a sniper?
[41:43.52]I don't understand.
[41:47.50]I just have to find the snipers.
[41:50.50]Okay.
[41:50.62]Uh... Is that a sniper?
[41:52.48]Well, you're not giving me... You're not giving me very much to go on here.
[41:55.59]Okay.
[42:11.37]Alright dude, like, can you give me a second?
[42:13.67]He's like, oh, go get the snipers, man.
[42:20.01]Another person died.
[42:20.97]How come you're not doing anything?
[42:29.47]Why haven't you started?
[42:30.43]And why is the sun directly in your face?
[42:36.11]Come on, Mason.
[42:36.93]Look directly into the fucking sun.
[42:38.71]Don't you understand how this mission works?
[42:43.08]God, my god, like... This guy is so fucking dead.
[42:46.87]Get out of my life.
[42:51.91]Best steak I've ever had.
[42:52.89]There's eight snipers.
[42:57.13]Jesus Christ.
[42:58.93]Alright, I'm gonna get my own sniping roost.
[43:06.95]Come on, make it to safety!
[43:10.02]No, they're too smart.
[43:11.14]That's unfortunate.
[43:20.24]Are you serious?
[43:23.86]Where the fuck- Okay, can- I fell in my own trap.
[43:31.64]This fucking sun.
[43:33.12]Get out of my eyes.
[43:35.14]Oh my god.
[43:37.10]Why?
[43:41.82]Oh my lord.
[43:50.17]I love how the concern is the snipers and not like the fucking literal chaos on the roads.
[43:57.47]Make sure you take out those snipers.
[43:59.93]But forget about the literal Armageddon that's everywhere on the road.
[44:05.12]You need to take care of the snipers.
[44:07.70]Not the explosions.
[44:13.56]Okay, now let me turn around and get back over here.
[44:18.32]Those purple cannons could be literal like the worst thing in the entire game This is the most annoying weapon I've ever had to fight against and I just I died I just killed that guy cuz I felt like it.
[44:31.36]You know what I mean?
[44:37.91]This purple shit that makes the gigantic explosions I
[44:47.83]Those people are killing us.
[44:50.09]I need to get back up.
[44:51.33]Get me back up.
[44:52.03]Get me back.
[44:52.55]Alright, we're going.
[44:55.35]Fucking purple ass cannons.
[45:00.07]Stupid fucking purple cannons, man.
[45:03.05]It's the purple cannons.
[45:05.51]Don't think it's anything else, because it's not anything else.
[45:08.97]It's the only issue.
[45:13.38]It's like the constant Overwatch ult on my screen.
[45:22.69]My lord.
[45:23.37]No, you don't get to go up there.
[45:26.41]Did you just... God.
[45:41.41]Get it off me.
[45:46.25]Get off of me.
[45:48.09]No, then his buddy's gonna climb up.
[45:49.37]I know how this works.
[45:50.35]I've seen this before.
[45:51.65]I've seen you guys all do this before.
[46:04.24]Where is the sniper?
[46:13.33]Do I honestly have to go in this building?
[46:15.29]There he is.
[46:18.58]It's like fucking Hollywood Squares.
[46:22.46]What happened?
[46:28.24]Get him.
[46:33.56]No, don't close in, EDF.
[46:34.94]You don't have to do that.
[46:42.92]Okay, give me the directions to how to get the fuck up here.
[46:45.31]Because it's one stupid roundabout way.
[46:47.63]Here it is.
[46:49.90]I have to go around the whole complex and turn around in this mess of a... Ugh.
[47:04.62]Oh, now you've got their attention.
[47:06.08]Yeah, I know.
[47:07.35]Now I got their attention, guys.
[47:08.57]Forget about the war zone.
[47:10.31]I've been trying to shoot that one guy in that PETA pocket for the last, like, 15 straight minutes.
[47:23.39]What?
[47:27.22]Oh, they're down.
[47:30.70]How are they down?
[47:31.38]I don't have any bullets left.
[47:35.60]I'm going to have to start blowing shit up.
[47:43.34]He shot that... He shot that mine out of midair.
[47:48.22]Uh-oh, sniper.
[47:53.89]Ow!
[47:54.17]Sniper!
[48:00.04]Fucking... I can't even see!
[48:13.03]Oh my god, why?
[48:14.03]This mission is so bad.
[48:16.25]This mission is so painful.
[48:20.35]Oh my lord.
[48:22.35]Yeah, oh no watch out for the five gunman I'm gonna go up here get to it.
[48:24.53]Here's the roosters over there this time.
[48:26.75]I'm not gonna fall down my imaginary hole I Didn't mean to do that to her
[48:53.85]Come on, it's for the video!
[48:55.19]Get in there, it's for the video!
[49:01.75]And she lived.
[49:03.39]Not for the video anymore.
[49:04.45]Alright, where is he?
[49:13.62]You know what would be great?
[49:14.58]If my screen would stop shaking.
[49:16.24]Like, violently.
[49:19.54]And how... It's...
[49:22.71]Oh my lord.
[49:34.59]Why?
[49:34.81]Why won't this kill him?
[49:43.33]Where the fuck?
[49:47.71]I'm gonna die again.
[49:51.18]Like...
[49:53.45]Honestly, you could have turned down some of this shit for this mission.
[49:57.95]It's a mission where you have to go get a sniper, and your screen explodes the entire time and shakes.
[50:04.79]How the fuck am I supposed to get rid of snipers, by the way?
[50:06.91]I don't have a sniper rifle.
[50:07.99]I have the butter gun.
[50:10.62]That fucking melts buildings, and apparently takes four shots to kill somebody.
[50:17.58]Now look at this shit.
[50:18.54]Look at this mess.
[50:19.18]And look, aiming over here aims into the sun.
[50:23.58]Like, you could lower this!
[50:28.97]Where is he?
[50:32.33]I have no idea where this guy is.
[50:33.59]He's apparently over here somewhere.
[50:35.49]He must have fallen down again.
[50:44.12]Okay, this mission's a crock of shit, and you all know it.
[50:49.57]If I go out there, I get exploded by pulse bombs.
[50:52.72]And there's no way for me to shoot that guy reliably.
[51:02.68]Alright, I'm voting this mission worst mission of the game.
[51:05.90]Out of any mission.
[51:08.49]This is done with a capital D. Why would you put a sniping mission in this game?
[51:16.05]What purpose does a sniping mission serve?
[51:19.22]What are you thinking?
[51:20.63]This game was like a 9 out of 10.
[51:22.19]And you put a fucking sniper mission in the game.
[51:28.85]I'm just gonna wrap around.
[51:37.97]I mean, should I just launch rockets at that building?
[51:40.24]Should I go get a different loadout?
[51:41.68]I don't understand.
[51:53.08]Oh my fucking god.
[51:54.82]I despise this mission.
[51:56.66]This mission is ruining the game for me.
[52:10.35]I'm blowing up the only bridge I have.
[52:13.83]I'm blowing up the only bridge that I have.
[52:15.91]I don't care about the innocents right now.
[52:17.77]We have to get rid of these people.
[52:20.05]If you're not gonna run, then you're in the way.
[52:22.35]Like, I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
[52:24.32]You gotta get out of the fucking way.
[52:26.88]There's, like, a thousand guards here.
[52:30.88]Like, this is what happens when you just, like, don't, like, I can't, I can't protect you if you don't run.
[52:36.27]Run!
[52:36.51]I'm gonna get sniped.
[52:45.77]I'm just, I'm just surrounded.
[53:06.63]Fucking god to get the fuck out of here I Can't I can't I'm taking out the building All right be proud of me granddad cuz I'm going for it I'll just take out the whole fucking building and Eventually, they'll have to die because this is this is straight up.
[53:32.08]This is dumb.
[53:33.34]This is real dumb.
[53:34.40]I
[53:35.71]So I ain't fucking around anymore.
[53:37.81]We're taking the building down.
[53:39.03]The whole thing.
[53:50.22]Let's just take the fucking building down.
[53:54.76]Can't snipe from there, can you?
[54:20.52]Oh my god, it's just too much.
[54:23.18]Hide behind the cash register.
[54:26.63]Can I go up the stairs?
[54:30.81]I can.
[54:35.48]Is the building- Oh, the building's coming down.
[54:37.94]Is this building coming down too?
[54:44.85]Okay, turns out that was the right thing to do.
[54:47.92]I did it right.
[54:49.50]Hey look, a sniper!
[54:51.34]Get the fuck out of here!
[54:57.92]He's not dead!
[54:58.76]Wait, what?
[55:02.73]Wait... How is he not dead?
[55:11.09]Where is he?
[55:13.54]Is that a sniper?
[55:16.31]There he is.
[55:16.75]Okay, they're just like... Oh my fucking god.
[55:24.01]Sniper.
[55:25.09]I'm going for the sniper.
[55:25.73]I gotta get full health and then we gotta get the sniper.
[55:32.47]Where is he?
[55:33.33]Okay, he's underneath here.
[55:36.15]I love how this guy is sniping people from down there.
[55:40.47]Okay, here we go.
[55:42.15]There he is.
[55:43.43]Check this one out.
[55:47.34]Reload it quick.
[55:53.14]He's dead?
[55:54.70]What the?
[55:55.48]He's dead.
[55:59.02]Woo!
[56:07.33]Let me in the building!
[56:14.33]There's only one more left.
[56:15.53]Get the fuck out of the way, people.
[56:20.39]Where is he?
[56:23.65]Where is this guy?
[56:24.73]We have to go all the way around?
[56:26.77]Let me get full health.
[56:31.64]Go, go.
[56:34.86]I have like nothing, by the way.
[56:36.62]We got to do it just like fucking grandpa would have.
[56:38.60]Wow.
[56:39.60]I'm dead.
[56:52.84]Just total panic.
[56:56.59]It's just panic.
[57:00.29]He's up there.
[57:04.29]I got four shots.
[57:05.55]He's up on that.
[57:06.65]There he is.
[57:09.11]You fucking prick.
[57:10.33]He's dead, right?
[57:13.78]Why?
[57:16.18]Why did that not kill him?
[57:18.38]Why?
[57:18.66]Why?
[57:21.43]I don't want to go destroy another building.
[57:29.34]God, this mission sucks.
[57:31.50]Pick up one of his pulse rifles.
[57:32.54]Somebody has a rifle, right?
[57:33.60]Give me one.
[57:36.86]So many people.
[57:37.38]I don't have anything.
[57:38.50]All I got is my fucking hammer.
[57:40.22]We're going to lure everybody up here and then I have to... Oh my god, the whole camp is after me.
[57:49.02]Holy shit.
[57:51.84]Okay, I gotta get in that building.
[57:54.26]Is there a way to get over there?
[57:55.10]No, from here.
[57:55.46]I gotta go across.
[57:57.84]Through here.
[57:58.84]Okay, we're good.
[57:59.42]The whole... Okay, we're fine.
[58:02.20]We're good.
[58:02.52]We're still okay.
[58:05.88]I can go up there.
[58:07.99]There's a thing up in here as well.
[58:11.25]Ammo.
[58:12.49]We're gonna get this motherfucker once and for all.
[58:15.41]There's the ammo.
[58:15.95]Nope.
[58:16.23]I'm just gonna hit him with a fucking... I'm gonna axe him right in the back of the head.
[58:21.52]Where are you?
[58:22.96]There he is.
[58:25.84]Done.
[58:26.00]I win.
[58:26.12]Thank God.
[58:26.66]Just hide here.
[58:28.12]When do we launch the... Okay.
[58:29.20]That was too much.
[58:49.45]That is a success.
[58:56.38]Is there a sniper rifle in the game?
[58:59.70]Can you actually get a sniper rifle?
[59:05.74]There's like an electric fence that guy.
[59:07.06]Let's take this shit out.
[59:08.46]It's here, why not?
[59:09.66]Yeah, there is a sniper, but how do you get it?
[59:12.97]It's the rail driver?
[59:22.94]One more support.
[59:23.86]That should be it.
[59:28.58]And it comes crashing down.
[59:30.00]There it goes.
[59:37.39]One of three monuments.
[59:40.11]Destroy.
[59:43.85]Actually, I don't even care if I die here.
[59:50.63]Uh, we're close to this.
[59:51.31]I need to go back here.
[59:52.31]I can't fast travel, but I'm very close.
[59:54.07]Oops.
[59:58.11]Can I pick weapons up?
[59:59.01]Yeah, I just... I'm gonna die.
[60:01.54]I'm surrounded by idiots.
[60:02.54]Oh, whatever.
[60:04.56]I don't even care.
[60:05.08]I'm surrounded by morons.
[60:13.34]Let's level here.
[60:15.20]Let's...
[60:15.86]upgrade something.
[60:16.60]I have a new thing I can unlock.
[60:17.68]I can unlock the jetpack and then we're going to go up to this mission.
[60:23.89]Alright, let's see.
[60:25.15]I have 850 jetpack.
[60:27.45]Boost yourself to higher areas.
[60:29.03]Yes.
[60:29.67]Don't even need to look at anything else.
[60:32.09]I don't have enough for anything else.
[60:37.44]Unleash a massive explosion.
[60:40.14]Interesting.
[60:42.50]How do I use the... Press space while in mid-air to activate the jetpack.
[60:51.09]How much do you... Is there a way to determine how much boost you get?
[60:56.67]I guess when it's green?
[60:57.69]I don't know.
[61:01.09]I guess you can see the back.
[61:02.21]Yeah, the back of it.
[61:04.54]So how much do you actually have?
[61:05.82]What is it like?
[61:07.28]One, two, three, four.
[61:10.30]It's about like three and a half seconds.
[61:11.58]All right, well, kind of cool.
[61:18.44]Just like Dead Space.
[61:21.35]Alright, let's go to the next mission with our dump truck.
[61:24.77]Thank you, DiamondsAreForeverLOL for the bits.
[61:28.19]There's no message.
[61:31.89]Myconics, thanks for the $1.20.
[61:35.89]$1.20.
[61:36.21]Fam got Hardee's on the way.
[61:39.45]Oh, Hardee's.
[61:40.09]I've never had Hardee's.
[61:41.93]Hardee's, Carl's Jr., none of those are really around to where I am.
[61:46.33]But, seems pretty good.
[61:51.41]Also, thank you to Peebles.
[61:54.75]Thanks for the bits, Peebles.
[61:56.09]I demand a German cooking show streamer.
[61:57.67]I'll tell your mom you're up past your bedtime again.
[62:00.45]Well, it's 8.45.
[62:02.49]So if it's past your bedtime at 8.45, yikes, you're probably like four.
[62:10.75]You're probably like four.
[62:12.56]Devlon, thanks for the 30 cents, Devlon.
[62:15.60]I'm not going to fart again.
[62:18.92]You're not missing out.
[62:19.56]Hardee's is not good.
[62:22.66]So what could you compare Hardee's to?
[62:25.30]Here's my fast food hierarchy, okay?
[62:27.14]You got, like, McDonald's is, like, I would probably say the worst.
[62:31.55]Well, Burger King's probably the worst.
[62:33.29]But Burger King tastes better than McDonald's and is, like, prepared better than McDonald's.
[62:38.91]But McDonald's might be probably better ingredient-wise, maybe, than Burger King.
[62:43.69]But I like Burger King more than McDonald's.
[62:45.15]So you got Wendy's is number one for me.
[62:47.95]I think Wendy's has the best hamburgers, the best chicken sandwiches and shit.
[62:54.25]Then you got McDonald's and Burger King are kind of tied.
[62:56.94]I would say Burger King is probably second.
[62:59.36]And then McDonald's is the worst.
[63:02.26]Doesn't mean I don't eat McDonald's.
[63:09.63]Chick-fil-a I've only had chick-fil-a like twice and it was like it was like God was inside of my mouth I Took a bite and and God was speaking to me inside of my head.
[63:24.23]It was very weird Five guys, I don't like five guys five guys is always like a greasy dirty hamburger every time I get one.
[63:37.02]I
[63:38.88]It's super fatty super like just like oily greasy fucking hamburger.
[63:43.28]It's not not my cup of tea Some people like it, but not me All right, you know you don't look you could say like a Taco Bell right Taco Bell could be on that list somewhere But we're we're talking like burger joints right like Taco Bell is not a burger restaurant KFC is not like a burger place
[64:07.91]I've unleashed burger nerd rage.
[64:11.29]Oh well.
[64:13.79]You going to a bad Five Guys?
[64:17.11]I've been to three or four different Five Guys.
[64:19.35]Been pretty much the same.
[64:21.49]And their fries are gross.
[64:24.79]Five Guys fries are fucking gross.
[64:27.21]Just because they're real doesn't mean they taste good.
[64:29.08]No, no!
[64:29.40]Five Guys!
[64:29.64]Look, we have bags!
[64:37.18]We have bags of potatoes all over the restaurant to show you how fucking real our food is.
[64:43.36]That don't fucking matter.
[64:44.10]Like, you get a bag of... You get a small fry from Five Guys.
[64:48.68]They fill a fucking lunch bag.
[64:51.84]And the thing is, like, greasy at the bottom.
[64:53.52]And they hand you, like, oh, yeah, can I get a small?
[64:55.58]They hand you, like, nine potatoes.
[64:57.06]Like, ten potatoes worth of french fries.
[64:59.42]And the bag is, like, fucking four pounds.
[65:03.30]Come on.
[65:03.80]Like...
[65:04.74]Give me a break.
[65:06.34]Just because it's real doesn't mean it's good.
[65:17.01]Value.
[65:18.97]And then you feel sick after eating it.
[65:22.23]It's fucking amazing.
[65:23.34]Shut up, Jeremiah.
[65:25.02]Look, we're all allowed to have opinions.
[65:26.32]I have things that I agree with with you.
[65:28.42]You have things that you disagree with with me.
[65:29.86]Like, for instance, five guys...
[65:34.17]I almost shit my pants one time after eating it and I never went back.
[65:44.87]Look, this is just dissent, alright?
[65:46.55]I'm just like, I'm causing a fucking conversation.
[65:49.62]We're having a conversation.
[65:50.82]Kind of monument.
[66:01.08]How dare you almost shit your pants.
[66:08.90]Oh, I didn't say five guys didn't taste good.
[66:16.67]Did I?
[66:17.21]I may have.
[66:18.41]I actually may have said that.
[66:22.25]Don't kill me, please.
[66:26.47]I did?
[66:26.83]Did I say it didn't taste good?
[66:34.21]And everybody talks about In-N-Out, too.
[66:35.77]Like, In-N-Out is not... I feel like In-N-Out has the same burger as Wendy's, but they, like, wrap it in a different wrapper.
[66:43.74]We've already had this conversation about, like, oh, wait, you went to In-N-Out, but you didn't order from the secret fucking menu?
[66:51.72]It's like, we already went over this in the Until Dawn stream.
[66:56.14]You tell me what your best fucking quality thing is.
[66:58.02]Put it on the menu.
[66:59.28]Why should I have to jump through hoops to fucking order something that's good?
[67:01.66]In-N-Out's...
[67:11.01]Not the secret menu rant again.
[67:14.59]Not the secret menu rant again.
[67:17.45]Shut the fuck up.
[67:18.59]I'm like actually pissing people off.
[67:24.70]Eliminate the targets.
[67:27.32]Okay.
[67:29.38]Don't let them escape.
[67:30.50]Well, can I just like plant charges here?
[67:40.18]Just take the fucking building down.
[67:44.02]Good luck escaping.
[67:50.38]Don't let the targets escape.
[67:52.20]Okay.
[68:04.09]Am I gonna, like, beat this?
[68:14.32]Come on, take it down.
[68:16.20]They don't really have a way to get out, do they?
[68:22.28]Might take the whole fucking building out.
[68:26.12]Eliminate those targets.
[68:32.66]Come on, take it out.
[68:38.69]Oh, it's almost done!
[68:44.68]That guy has a shield?
[68:46.06]What the fuck is up with that?
[68:48.12]They're like sitting ducks up there.
[68:49.20]There's not much stairs to go down.
[68:50.96]Just take the whole entire building down and they'll all die.
[68:53.64]And I can beat the mission.
[68:56.67]You're so lucky that I'm hitting the walls.
[69:01.07]Don't let them escape.
[69:13.80]Oh, come on.
[69:14.88]You're so close.
[69:16.44]There it goes.
[69:18.57]All the targets.
[69:19.99]There they are.
[69:28.07]Oh, shit.
[69:29.69]I don't know what to do.
[69:36.00]They're just sitting ducks.
[69:37.04]This is so dumb.
[69:39.16]And they can't die from fall damage, apparently.
[69:46.23]I guess just take out the floor until you see him.
[69:51.32]No, he's up higher.
[69:52.04]There he is.
[69:52.68]No, he's up higher.
[69:54.46]He's on the roof?
[69:56.54]All right, whatever.
[69:59.60]I win.
[69:59.77]Oh, that was easy.
[70:15.77]I didn't even need to do that.
[70:16.65]I'd have to walk in the building and aim up.
[70:20.50]No morale bonus, but whatever.
[70:21.78]That's fine.
[70:25.72]We've got to take out some structures here.
[70:27.32]We're going to have a full bar.
[70:33.37]Just take a look at this.
[70:35.79]No, I don't want to do this.
[70:36.53]I hate these missions.
[70:38.69]When you ride and the guy's back of his car and you just shoot stuff.
[70:42.25]No, I don't want to do that.
[70:45.16]What does morale actually do?
[70:48.61]Uh, morale... God damn it.
[70:49.93]What am I thinking?
[70:50.91]Oh, what am I thinking?
[70:51.77]Just give me another car.
[70:54.11]Uh, morale is, like, how your troops are doing.
[70:56.89]I guess.
[71:01.72]Oh, this is a destruction thing over there.
[71:03.22]I'll try that one.
[71:08.07]Very clean.
[71:12.82]Some things are indestructible and the best you can do is a hell of a lot of damage.
[71:16.00]Okay.
[71:18.47]So just destroy the building.
[71:27.93]Did I do a good job?
[71:42.84]Uh, I don't think I did it.
[71:50.18]No, I didn't.
[71:51.71]Uh, okay.
[71:55.45]Maybe I did.
[72:04.38]Maybe I did.
[72:05.28]I just have to go around and hit it now.
[72:12.32]Coming down, coming down.
[72:15.74]Bring the whole damn thing down, please.
[72:18.99]Hey, good evening!
[72:28.86]What is like a failure on this mission?
[72:38.78]I don't know.
[72:39.50]I'm sure we'll find out.
[72:40.36]Oh, this one.
[72:47.04]Come on.
[72:51.92]It has to be getting close.
[72:59.00]Not getting the ammo.
[72:59.98]Oh, wait.
[73:00.32]I thought I couldn't... I thought you were only allowed... Nah, I can't get the ammo crates.
[73:05.87]What are you guys talking about?
[73:08.91]There are no ammo crates allowed.
[73:15.71]I'm dead.
[73:17.81]Well, failed it.
[73:22.27]Failed the mission.
[73:25.29]Can I not use the mech?
[73:26.29]I don't think so.
[73:27.05]I'm going to try to... Let's get in here.
[73:28.79]I'm going to try this.
[73:40.35]What if I just, like, go up?
[73:41.47]Like, right in the middle.
[73:42.43]Like, straight up through the, uh, middle.
[73:49.77]Well, that did it.
[73:51.63]That sure did it.
[73:53.89]What the fuck?!
[73:55.15]No!
[73:55.77]Why?!
[74:00.08]Well, that was perfect!
[74:01.32]And, like, what the f- Ah, man, come on!
[74:05.32]What happened?
[74:06.08]Ah!
[74:07.88]That was how you do it.
[74:08.70]That was the way to do it.
[74:09.71]And, like, it just... Whatever.
[74:12.19]God damn it.
[74:27.89]It's okay.
[74:31.32]That should be it.
[74:31.92]That's it, right?
[74:38.14]Apparently, that's not it.
[74:41.88]That's not it?
[74:42.26]It's not even on the minimap anymore.
[74:51.41]Destroy the building.
[74:52.29]I did not destroy the building, apparently.
[74:54.85]Even though it's not on the minimap.
[75:03.16]What else do I need to destroy?
[75:04.08]Okay.
[75:07.13]Ceiling falling on you never gets old.
[75:10.09]I could imagine it doesn't get old for me.
[75:12.03]It's still like goofy and stupid.
[75:13.25]I love it What Do I have to destroy like every single piece of this in like one shot or something I
[75:40.22]At the very top, maybe.
[75:41.82]I mean, it looks like I did it, but whatever.
[75:50.12]I guess not.
[75:50.80]Oh, well.
[75:56.18]I might as well just die, because I didn't do it right, I guess.
[76:04.88]Nope.
[76:06.54]Nope!
[76:11.42]jumping and hammering.
[76:13.28]This doesn't seem to be doing very much for me.
[76:17.32]It kind of is, but not really.
[76:23.22]No, I guess I gotta try to get it to blow up the very top or something.
[76:29.16]Is there a way just to restart the mission?
[76:32.98]I wish there was.
[76:33.54]Can someone just hit me in the fucking head, please?
[76:38.77]So I can end this.
[76:45.42]Kill me.
[76:47.34]Just fucking kill me.
[76:49.32]Just walk out of the area.
[76:59.82]So, I guess you just need... A rocket needs to explode up there.
[77:04.47]So, let's try this one more time.
[77:09.07]Last attempt.
[77:09.55]I'm gonna go try to go up this side.
[77:13.39]You know, what if I do this?
[77:16.90]You know, what if I just, like, climb up here?
[77:19.16]You know?
[77:20.93]And do it like... Okay, so that is what you have to do.
[77:24.73]Alright.
[77:27.45]So I gotta get, like, out the top.
[77:31.41]Where is the top?
[77:32.71]Like, right... Like, right in the middle there.
[77:35.25]There's the top.
[77:40.52]So, like, right up there.
[77:45.34]I need to shoot a rocket, like, in here.
[77:49.63]And blow it up, like, there.
[77:53.55]Go this way.
[78:03.38]Get up there.
[78:07.46]God damn it.
[78:08.64]Why shift?
[78:11.08]Also, to activate this.
[78:13.62]Kind of don't want that.
[78:22.39]Stairs out what if I take the stairs I can't float up like I can't use my jetpack for fun I Need to use my jetpack.
[78:28.76]I don't care for the stairs.
[78:29.64]I want to fly all right What happens if I like shoot it down Like should I blow should I get rid of this should I try to take this top part out don't die I Went right through the fucking middle
[78:50.20]Oh my god, now I am gonna take the fucking stairs.
[78:52.26]Alright, I'm just gonna shoot it up here.
[79:23.31]Okay, that's what you have to do.
[79:27.94]I thought I could fly up.
[79:29.56]I thought I could fly and be cool about it.
[79:57.86]That's not it.
[80:06.18]Use the nano gun on the supports, it doesn't do anything.
[80:10.08]If you were curious.
[80:11.44]You can't get rid of the supports.
[80:16.84]Watch!
[80:22.59]Get more rockets?
[80:23.67]You can only use what they give you.
[80:29.04]I can do this, but the supports on the outside cannot die.
[80:38.02]I can't get that one.
[80:46.70]That's all there is to it.
[80:47.74]There's an ammo box upstairs.
[80:50.78]I thought you couldn't open the... Why couldn't I open the other one?
[80:54.81]What?
[80:54.99]All right, you guys clearly saw me try to open the one that was on the ground and it didn't open.
[80:59.16]It didn't even give me a prompt.
[81:03.20]What the fuck?
[81:05.16]There was no prompt.
[81:06.32]You guys saw me try to do that for like five straight seconds.
[81:15.70]Okay, well that changes things.
[81:21.76]What if I just hit stuff like this?
[81:35.37]You can't get rid of those.
[81:36.95]That's for certain.
[81:37.95]What if you just do this?
[81:39.33]I just want to see what this does.
[81:40.37]I don't think it's enough.
[81:49.03]Might be.
[81:49.31]I don't know.
[81:50.09]I'm doing a test here.
[81:58.06]I can't get removed.
[81:59.02]God damn it.
[82:16.06]We're doing this for science.
[82:17.20]I just want to see what happens.
[82:23.41]Oh, come on!
[82:24.11]Really?
[82:29.40]Really?
[82:34.82]What is holding that up at the top?
[82:50.55]How is this building still up?
[83:01.94]What?
[83:02.70]What is still standing?
[83:03.64]I don't understand this.
[83:22.89]so this built this did I did I do it I guess I didn't do it I guess there's like a well okay I I I give up I'm done I'm not sitting here for like another 30 minutes wrong building that would be so funny
[83:52.13]You have to literally destroy everything in this mission.
[83:54.65]It's super dumb.
[83:56.21]Oh.
[83:57.23]So this mission is just dumb?
[84:01.95]One final try.
[84:03.15]I feel like that was the correct thing.
[84:04.58]I'm going to climb up here.
[84:06.60]Let me get the boxes before I destroy anything.
[84:16.00]There's a couple other boxes here.
[84:17.24]Let me get them all.
[84:17.98]Let me just take out the supports at the top.
[84:20.86]And let's see if I can do anything about it.
[84:22.46]Where's the other box?
[84:28.49]This shit sucks.
[84:30.87]It kind of does.
[84:36.79]Did I miss this box?
[84:37.85]Is it on, like, ground level or something?
[84:44.40]Okay, yeah, because I feel like this is going to help a lot.
[84:46.92]So I'm going to take out the whole thing at the top.
[84:52.99]Why go for the supports at the top?
[84:54.13]Because the supports at the bottom can't be touched.
[84:59.55]Let me see here.
[85:00.75]What is this all connected to?
[85:01.73]I'm gonna go, like, up on the lip.
[85:05.75]Don't fall down this shit, that'd be bad.
[85:07.41]Alright, this, like, thing here.
[85:10.14]Like, from the square up.
[85:13.52]Let's get to, like, a good spot where I'm not gonna fall.
[85:17.24]And let's see here.
[85:18.36]Uh, so I wanna get rid of... Like, this.
[85:24.21]this.
[85:30.32]Shit!
[85:30.70]It's the wrong one.
[85:31.30]It's this one.
[85:33.96]I can hear it waning.
[85:34.76]I can hear it whining.
[85:40.12]That one.
[85:46.29]Okay, what about over there?
[85:47.37]Alright, it's coming down here in a second.
[85:54.61]Almost.
[85:59.32]Fucking goddammit.
[86:00.46]They like all look the same.
[86:05.42]That's not gonna come down?
[86:07.78]Bullshit.
[86:17.43]What the fuck is still holding you up?
[86:26.18]Am I like playing fucking Legos right now, or like why is this thing still standing?
[86:44.13]Fucking fall!
[86:47.15]It's so close, but it just won't do it.
[86:56.98]I don't know what kind of construction you'll run in here, buddy.
[86:59.68]But this thing does not stand.
[87:01.38]If all this shit is missing.
[87:11.07]What the fuck?
[87:18.96]I'm gonna fuck out of here.
[87:36.44]This is just way too finicky for me.
[87:38.31]This is fucking dumb.
[87:40.13]Get me the fuck out of this one.
[87:48.01]Yeah, mate.
[87:48.37]Goodbye.
[87:50.24]I'm not giving this the time that it apparently needs.
[87:52.64]Because this shit is fucking stupid.
[87:59.05]The floor?
[87:59.71]Look, you can't take out the floor.
[88:01.55]You can't take out any of these supports on the floor.
[88:04.89]You saw me here for like fucking 30 minutes trying to take out the floor part.
[88:08.06]Get the fuck out of here.
[88:23.10]Streamer quits level like he quit Dark Souls.
[88:25.34]What are you talking about?
[88:28.21]Take out the crown.
[88:30.08]And that rocket launcher doesn't even make any sense.
[88:32.50]Like, there's a gigantic explosion and shit's just still standing.
[88:36.36]What the fuck is that?
[88:40.40]Just take and use the car?
[88:42.60]Nah, that's one of those things.
[88:45.04]It's just too finicky.
[88:46.20]I don't want to fuck with it all day.
[88:47.96]I could sit there for like three hours doing that.
[88:50.76]So let's go take this out.
[88:56.98]Use the nano rifle.
[88:58.06]Look, alright.
[88:59.12]Like, it's real easy to talk a bunch of shit, but like, you do it.
[89:05.93]Come on.
[89:06.41]I'll do it.
[89:17.85]I'll pass.
[89:18.91]I did do it.
[89:20.33]Yeah, right.
[89:21.43]Bullshit.
[89:25.97]Take the controller right now and do it.
[89:38.34]Press G for health.
[89:45.14]Holy shit, this thing turns.
[89:46.60]Come on.
[89:47.42]Come on.
[89:47.98]Hard turn.
[89:49.72]I did it seven years ago.
[89:51.14]That matters.
[89:58.14]I could link you a video explaining it.
[90:02.38]Well, I don't even... I don't even care.
[90:05.99]It's a dumb green mission.
[90:07.23]They don't even matter.
[90:10.63]We don't really care about a green shit mission, do we?
[90:13.19]Let's take this fucking bridge out.
[90:20.48]I don't have any items.
[90:24.62]Oh, that's just fucking wonderful.
[90:52.74]What does this mean?
[90:57.44]Where's the next mission?
[91:00.44]I think I need to get this down to zero, right?
[91:03.64]I don't see any missions.
[91:08.37]I gotta blow up this bridge.
[91:31.58]Place for what the fuck are you guys even talking about?
[91:34.68]I've never played spore again In fact, I'm gonna shatter the fucking disk I'm gonna go into my hard drive And I'm going to fucking find the sector that spore is installed on and I'm going to fucking rip the cords out of it and I'm gonna fucking pee on the cords and then I'm gonna fucking put them in the garbage can I
[91:56.41]Then I'm going to call Will Wheaton, the guy that made Spore, and be like, hey, don't ever make another game again.
[92:14.39]Streamer rage is live.
[92:15.71]Let's go over here.
[92:26.90]Well, this is a sturdy bridge.
[92:35.55]That's not a smart place to be.
[92:36.67]Holy sh- Okay, it's coming down.
[92:41.22]I'm gonna cut it in half.
[92:53.58]I probably shouldn't be standing on it when it falls, though.
[92:55.93]That's probably not the greatest idea.
[92:59.95]Oh, Jesus.
[93:10.70]Run!
[93:13.04]Look out!
[93:28.51]It's almost done.
[93:29.69]There's no supports holding it.
[93:32.05]It's got to be close.
[93:36.18]29%.
[93:36.46]Get out of here, you fucking idiot.
[93:43.10]You can't fly with one wing, can you?
[93:44.84]I wish you crapped on the bridge.
[93:47.24]That would have been awesome.
[93:51.28]Let's do this.
[93:54.96]It's still holding you up.
[93:56.68]Um...
[94:08.10]Holy shit, there's a lot of people.
[94:13.84]Oh my lord.
[94:16.22]Too many of you guys.
[94:17.02]I hear the guy fucking screaming.
[94:31.26]Don't kill me.
[94:32.79]God damn fucking god.
[94:54.71]I had to go like underneath it.
[94:59.61]Let's go back and do it again.
[95:31.51]I don't want to go around this right now.
[95:49.99]I thought it was this bridge for a second.
[95:51.19]I was like, why is this bridge shrunk?
[96:11.76]Alright, you fucking piece of shit bridge.
[96:27.17]Get rid of all this dumb shit.
[96:37.12]What else we got?
[96:38.28]The top part.
[96:52.50]Come on.
[96:52.88]I can hear you whining.
[96:53.94]I can hear you whining.
[97:00.22]Come on.
[97:00.80]Take it down.
[97:01.48]Go.
[97:03.02]Come on.
[97:04.44]You're almost there.
[97:05.41]I promise.
[97:13.27]What are you doing over here?
[97:17.93]I'm trying... Get out of here.
[97:26.60]Where am I being shot from?
[97:31.49]Where did you guys even go?
[97:33.87]You guys just came out of the fucking ground.
[97:37.61]Where's your subterranean vehicle?
[97:38.95]Because it just makes no sense why you're standing here.
[97:41.11]Give me that shi-
[97:57.68]He died fucking instantly.
[97:58.92]Alright, we're gonna go do something else before I actually get angry at this game.
[98:08.60]Forget about the fucking bridge.
[98:21.76]He shot my bomb in midair and killed me.
[98:31.61]Oh, this way.
[98:34.57]Oddly enough, that bridge is why I never finished the game.
[98:38.41]Really?
[98:39.99]It's that fucking annoying?
[98:45.15]This stupid fucking bridge is the reason?
[98:47.51]I can see that.
[98:48.15]I can see how a couple of these specific finicky ass things could really turn you off from wanting to complete the whole thing.
[99:04.91]Straight up here.
[99:24.99]Around.
[99:32.98]Stuff to destroy.
[99:34.73]Let's go back to playing the game.
[99:36.23]That would be, like, fun.
[99:38.87]Goodbye.
[100:04.32]Alright, I successfully turned this building into a fork.
[100:06.80]I didn't do anything else.
[100:07.99]There we go.
[100:17.93]Scrap, scrap, scrap.
[100:32.95]Support!
[100:33.75]Get it!
[100:37.84]Where did you?
[100:38.56]All of you!
[100:42.12]I'm like turning into Paul Bearer.
[100:44.34]I got it.
[100:56.09]It's done.
[100:56.73]Go.
[101:03.67]Goodbye.
[101:06.31]See ya.
[101:09.18]Okay.
[101:09.96]I guess I could go up here.
[101:12.78]Let's go this way.
[101:19.55]Yeah.
[101:21.39]Yeah.
[101:21.99]Let's go up here.
[101:27.39]Escape the police.
[101:47.10]Let me, uh, rip around this corner.
[101:54.04]Oh, there's one of those monuments.
[102:00.01]Can I, like, get it from here?
[102:00.73]I might be able to actually get that from here.
[102:08.01]Is somebody moving me?
[102:08.97]Why is this car moving?
[102:10.09]Oh, I hit the brakes.
[102:16.47]Is this, alright, is this Left 4 Dead?
[102:18.37]I turned the corner and all of a sudden like the director spawned a hundred people on me.
[102:22.96]Am I playing fucking Left 4 Dead 3?
[102:25.86]Jesus Christ.
[102:29.65]I don't think I can go down this way.
[102:42.32]Like seriously, I shoot- I stop the car and fucking a hundred enemies just- and every fucking 360 goddamn degrees.
[102:51.98]And a mammoth tank.
[102:58.42]Jesus fucking Christ.
[103:17.29]Alright, is this what you guys were talking about when you said that the later part of this game was really fucking annoying?
[103:22.42]Is this what I was warned about?
[103:24.94]How like stupidly hard and annoying the end of this game is?
[103:28.44]Because a lot of people told me that.
[103:30.82]Is this what you were referring to?
[103:44.69]Yes.
[103:51.22]It gets worse, oh god, does it?
[104:01.57]Don't worry, I'm gonna beat it.
[104:13.84]I hope it gets worse.
[104:19.23]Alright, so for instance, right?
[104:20.23]Like, this is where I was stopped the last time.
[104:22.45]And all of a sudden... Everything was calm, everything was normal.
[104:26.97]And there's 5,000 people in every single corner of my eye.
[104:35.59]Like, I stopped my car to sightsee for a second, and all of a sudden it was just like, GET HIM!
[104:40.95]SURROUND THIS MOTHERFUCKER!
[104:42.35]Alright, well... I actually am gonna... Now I am gonna aggro everybody.
[104:58.66]Perfect!
[104:59.26]Exactly what I wanted!
[105:00.10]Goodbye!
[105:29.73]Hello, hello, hello.
[105:30.57]Just melt them.
[105:37.62]Easier that way.
[105:47.44]Easy now, easy now.
[105:54.71]Don't!
[105:55.31]Oh boy, I'm dead.
[105:56.19]Oh my god, I'm so dead.
[106:04.20]I think I need to upgrade some items because I feel like I'm not doing shit.
[106:17.51]I feel like my weapons aren't good enough to fight these guys.
[106:27.87]the machine gun is starting to look like a a weapon that I don't want to be using I don't know maybe maybe the mines too let's do we're going to try this I'm going to use the rocket launcher and I'm going to upgrade the rocket launcher the next time I get a chance
[106:55.29]What do I have for a... Hold on.
[107:01.73]I need... Rocket ammo and multi-rockets.
[107:06.03]I can do this.
[107:12.05]Multi-rockets.
[107:12.95]Let's try this.
[107:14.05]I can do three at the same time.
[107:16.61]Install the nude mod.
[107:21.09]Rocket ammo is 350. 350.
[107:24.87]Nice.
[107:25.83]I'm doing multi-rockets.
[107:26.87]How do you shoot multiple rockets, though?
[107:28.76]Hold it down until the weapon fires?
[107:30.16]Okay.
[107:30.54]You just have to hold the button down.
[107:34.80]I've used the Singularity Bomb twice.
[107:39.10]Although, I want to see what the hell the MOAB is.
[107:40.82]Okay.
[107:53.25]Demolitions bastard.
[107:54.31]No, I want to destroy this shit.
[107:57.17]This time I'm going to just not drive in the front door.
[108:04.79]Mother of all BS.
[108:11.18]Thank you, holeofonezombie, for the 20 bucks.
[108:15.08]And they say, if you get my dollar, that means I could give this crowbar.
[108:18.76]Then you can give me back my dollar.
[108:20.48]You already did this.
[108:21.18]You already made that joke.
[108:31.15]Thank you though, and he says, you know, thank you for the 20 bucks Appreciate it There is no nude mod if there's a nude mod in this game then then all faith in humanity is gone I
[108:53.21]Why does the garbage truck have a... You know, why does the garbage truck have a rocket launcher?
[108:56.79]I don't know.
[109:01.63]Where is it?
[109:03.23]No, I don't want to do that.
[109:04.25]That shit's too far away.
[109:07.73]Up here.
[109:12.68]I still have faith in humanity?
[109:14.14]Sometimes.
[109:18.22]You need the nude mod to blow things up.
[109:30.29]Alright.
[109:31.55]I gotta make this, like, smart.
[109:34.82]I'm getting out here.
[109:35.56]I'm not driving this into the fucking base.
[109:37.20]I'm gonna take this out from over here.
[109:42.36]I should be able to get this from here, right?
[109:51.10]Hopefully.
[109:54.12]Can I get enough damage on it?
[109:57.86]Yeah.
[110:00.51]That's it.
[110:01.33]All the monuments are gone.
[110:02.27]Let's sneak around this way.
[110:10.51]Here comes a bunch of people to investigate my exact location.
[110:17.60]Here comes the cavalry.
[110:19.00]Alright.
[110:24.94]Fine.
[110:25.12]Wrap around this way.
[110:26.02]Go for it.

[110:28.76]Every single one of yous.
[110:29.73]Come around.
[110:32.16]Keep going.
[110:42.58]Okay.
[110:43.90]I made it up.
[110:45.55]Now let's launch three rockets at this thing.
[110:49.17]That's not a rocket.
[110:52.97]Holy shit.
[110:54.23]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[111:01.75]Damn.
[111:07.91]That actually is really cool.
[111:14.61]I gotta go.
[111:15.37]Holy shit.
[111:17.17]Too many people.
[111:17.80]Oh my god, I'm gonna die again.
[111:22.04]Just skate down.
[111:22.72]Skate down. 66%.
[111:38.14]Stop shooting at me, I'm opening a box.
[111:53.60]I broke the fucking podium.
[112:03.91]My wrist!
[112:08.62]Got it.
[112:10.02]I just broke my fucking arm.
[112:17.10]I want the scrap, but it's not worth it.
[112:26.89]Plus seven.
[112:27.47]This one's gone in a second.
[112:44.22]And my escape is right over there.
[112:45.66]There it is.
[112:50.47]Government building is down.
[112:51.85]And I'm about to be down.
[112:55.65]I knew it.
[112:56.93]I knew if I turned the corner and I tried to fly, I knew it was going to happen.
[113:01.36]I don't know why I turned around.
[113:03.60]I was 100% certain that that was going to happen.
[113:07.84]But I wanted to pick up one scrap.
[113:09.38]Well, that was so worth it.
[113:10.34]At least I got rid of it.
[113:13.53]I was 100% fucking certain that was going to happen.
[113:22.48]Okay, I gotta get rid of this bridge.
[113:29.20]Hmm.
[113:34.47]Run into the following... I don't know why.
[113:35.49]I don't know what the hell I was doing.
[113:36.95]Like I told you, I was certain that was going to happen.
[113:47.83]Go get the big mech.
[113:49.03]I don't know where that is.
[113:52.58]I saw my own death.
[113:55.04]I watched it happen.
[113:57.64]And then for some reason... I was like, you know, there's only like... There's only like 60 guys there.
[114:06.44]That are all shooting purple fucking Overwatch ult beams at me.
[114:10.36]Let me turn around and look at them for a second and insta-die.
[114:23.32]I want to see your reaction to the jump scares.
[114:33.91]The Twitch sub cannons.
[114:36.89]Whole of one zombie.
[114:37.79]Thanks for the $15.
[114:38.99]Again, I needed that crowbar.
[114:43.39]You can have my crowbar.
[114:45.39]Why do you want my crowbar, zombie?
[114:49.50]You can go to, like, Home Depot and buy a crowbar for, like, four bucks.
[114:58.68]You know what?
[114:59.10]Actually, I'm going to steal one of those Twitch TV guns.
[115:05.86]I want a Twitch.tv gun.
[115:08.17]I'm going to get it.
[115:13.21]Who pissed in my ass this morning?
[115:18.33]Nobody did.
[115:21.76]I just got, like, made fun of a shitload like an hour ago.
[115:24.76]And it made me irritated.
[115:31.27]I looked over at chat and people are, like, talking about how much I suck and how much of a loser and idiot I am.
[115:36.55]You know, sometimes you look at that and you're like, well, fucking hey!
[115:40.12]Come on!
[115:44.70]Nobody pissed in my cereal.
[115:45.96]Twitch chat peed in my face.
[115:47.78]Like, there's a difference, you know what I mean?
[115:53.36]Nobody peed in my cereal.
[115:54.38]Twitch chat peed in my face.
[115:57.72]Do I want to do this?
[115:59.44]Not really.
[116:02.86]I'm gonna do this.
[116:03.74]Those are always so easy.
[116:09.47]What's the difference?
[116:12.07]Shoot your horse.
[116:13.35]Oh my god.
[116:22.12]Taxi!
[116:27.68]Okay, well this is destroy EDF vehicles.
[116:30.44]I'll get inside this thing.
[116:31.40]Hell yeah.
[116:37.90]I guess they're already here.
[116:38.93]They just like showed up.
[116:44.85]This is a trap.
[116:48.63]I got trapped in here.
[116:52.94]He took the bait.
[116:53.62]I feel like a fish.
[117:02.77]All right, let's just turn.
[117:08.17]Oh, fellas, he took the bait.
[117:09.52]He took the giant indestructible tank.
[117:11.54]Get him.
[117:22.59]What are you thinking?
[117:23.21]You're not gonna sneak up behind me.
[117:24.77]Don't even try that.
[117:32.46]Speaking of guys behind me... 15 out of 35!
[117:36.04]Destroy!
[117:36.20]I'm hitting the ground.
[117:36.70]I need to aim up higher.
[118:02.01]Jesus I don't even know what what that was.
[118:14.74]Is it a walker?
[118:17.24]I'm confused Think I'm doing it
[118:30.12]I think I'm doing a good job, bomb.
[118:32.79]Maybe.
[118:40.73]Okay.
[118:42.48]Who's left?
[118:42.84]That guy killed himself.
[119:01.61]One more of those big guys.
[119:03.55]That's one more of me.
[119:06.20]Almost.
[119:10.30]Alright, please don't kill this.
[119:13.38]Hey!
[119:14.00]I did it!
[119:14.94]Complete completion.
[119:17.74]What do you get for doing that?
[119:20.80]Do you actually get EDF support?
[119:25.31]Oh, this is a good enough time.
[119:27.01]Give me one second.
[119:28.33]I'm going to take a pee break.
[119:29.63]I need to get something else to drink.
[119:32.16]I'll be right back.
[122:58.95]Alright.
[123:09.84]Give me a sec.
[123:14.74]I need to restart this game.
[123:16.66]Display!
[123:27.92]119 hertz.
[123:28.48]I got to go back here to do this.
[123:29.84]There it is.
[123:33.54]Oh, fuck.
[123:34.04]Hold on.
[123:34.62]There we go.
[123:47.96]Oh, can you guys hear me?
[123:50.00]Hello?
[123:52.04]Am I on mic?
[123:56.78]That was fucking loud.
[123:57.74]What the hell was that?
[124:01.72]Alt-Enter?
[124:02.86]The last time I tried to do that, I don't think it worked.
[124:06.22]No, no, no, no.
[124:07.33]He can't hear you.
[124:08.01]No.
[124:08.17]Alright, let's go.
[124:10.91]Not very much left to do here.
[124:15.11]That stupid fucking bridge.
[124:17.25]Before I tear my eyeballs out, I have to figure out how to get rid of that.
[124:20.23]Um...
[124:26.74]Let's just take a ride up here.
[124:28.50]And destroy some more EDF-controlled buildings.
[124:38.30]I kind of want... Gutter.
[124:43.90]I kind of want to use this.
[124:46.31]I don't really want to replace it with anything, though.
[124:51.83]No, we'll stick with this for now.
[125:06.47]You can get light mechs by garages.
[125:07.99]That's cool.
[125:14.81]You know, I wish I could just, like, have Twitch chat just in my brain.
[125:19.15]Like, scrolling down, like, inside of my head.
[125:22.85]And I swear to God, like, I turn my head to the left to re-chat, and I crash into a wall.
[125:26.85]Like, why can't I just have it implanted into my brain?
[125:28.57]I can put a man on the moon, but we can't have Twitch chat implanted into my fucking brain.
[125:34.33]What's up with that?
[125:39.21]Don't want that.
[125:42.79]Google Glass.
[125:43.61]Yeah, I'm going to get Google Glass just for Twitch Chat.
[125:49.32]We're working on it.
[125:54.06]Text-to-speech Twitch Chat.
[125:55.24]That would be a nightmare.
[125:58.54]That would be a living nightmare.
[126:03.16]What do you think that would be like?
[126:04.78]You know what?
[126:07.51]I kind of want to try to do that one day.
[126:10.01]Just have Twitch chat be text-to-speech.
[126:14.87]And just see what happens.
[126:17.81]Just have text-to-speech on my stream and it's Twitch chat.
[126:22.59]I don't know how it would work, but I would want to turn it on.
[126:24.79]After, like, three minutes, it would be probably turned off.
[126:33.24]Do it.
[126:33.64]Do it.
[126:34.92]All you guys want to say, like, the crazy shit.
[126:38.32]You're going to be all drowned out by each other anyways.
[126:41.16]It would be a living... It would be like a living art piece.
[126:50.80]I want to pick up that gun.
[126:52.95]I want this gun.
[126:53.77]The guy that got this gun.
[126:54.45]The gun the guy has.
[126:55.37]This thing.
[126:56.01]I want your gun.
[126:56.81]Give it to me.
[126:57.15]Give me that gun.
[127:01.31]Give me it.
[127:01.61]Where'd it go?
[127:05.27]Okay.
[127:06.53]I want you to swap out this.
[127:13.21]This thing has like no ammo.
[127:21.54]This thing is kind of cool.
[127:26.06]Don't tell him.
[127:26.66]What do you mean don't tell me what?
[127:28.16]Why are you guys keeping secrets from me?
[127:32.18]That's not nice.
[127:33.88]Don't keep secrets from me.
[127:35.24]What did I do to deserve secrets?
[127:38.40]Get in the clown car.
[127:51.51]Don't tell him.
[127:54.17]I'm gonna find out.
[127:56.19]Someone's gonna tell me the truth.
[128:05.91]This gun is... This gun is awful.
[128:11.94]Is this gun as bad as it... Is this gun bad?
[128:14.50]I think this gun's bad.
[128:19.92]Why am I... Okay, yeah, just leave.
[128:21.76]Why am I sitting there contemplating?
[128:22.98]If the gun is bad, run away.
[128:26.66]Is this bad?
[128:27.62]Is this gun... What's that?
[128:29.74]That's blocked off or whatever.
[128:37.55]Okay, I'll tell you.
[128:38.45]I'm hitting a shield.
[128:43.43]Interesting.
[128:48.62]Okay, here's the truth.
[128:49.68]Tell me the whole truth.
[128:52.63]And nothing but the truth.
[128:54.63]So help me gourd.
[128:57.47]The whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[129:00.47]Make sure you lie.
[129:01.98]Tell me a... Hold on a second, guys.
[129:04.08]Hold on.
[129:08.06]I can open up this fucking can of peas.
[129:09.56]Yeah!
[129:10.12]There you go.
[129:11.96]Thanks, Jeremy.
[129:12.62]You're welcome.
[129:15.47]The whole truth, nothing but the truth.
[129:17.43]So help me gourd.
[129:22.92]I almost, like, didn't do that.
[129:24.00]Wasn't even peas, it was like a can of artichokes.
[129:34.50]I don't know, something fucking gross.
[129:41.43]I like artichokes, I'm kidding, it was a joke.
[129:49.59]Is that one of those secrets?
[129:53.77]No, okay, that's fire.
[129:55.05]I thought that was one of those weird secret things where you can find the Moab.
[130:05.62]Let's keep going up.
[130:06.92]And around.
[130:07.52]Do I think I actually have to destroy the bridge?
[130:12.99]Funny joke.
[130:15.25]Yeah.
[130:16.77]What's that say?
[130:19.09]What's that say in, uh... What's that say in... Okay, what's that say in Japanese?
[130:25.48]Something.
[130:33.92]Straight ahead.
[130:35.52]I think we do have to go to the bridge.
[130:36.76]I'm going to be so mad if I have to destroy that bridge.
[130:47.05]I think I have to destroy the bridge.
[130:49.51]God!
[130:50.93]What the fuck?
[130:54.68]God damn it.
[130:56.96]I can't get a break in this game, man.
[131:00.14]I just want to do the... Look, it's okay.
[131:03.88]We fast traveled.
[131:04.74]I gotta lighten up a little bit.
[131:17.21]For some reason, I'm really irritated.
[131:20.86]Like, my rage holds no bounds right now.
[131:22.96]And, like, that should have been really funny.
[131:24.81]And I was just like, not funny.
[131:27.09]Like, I didn't think that.
[131:28.31]For a second, I didn't think that was funny.
[131:30.81]Lighten up, man.
[131:31.57]What's going on?
[131:32.17]This isn't a home.
[131:33.85]It's a police station.
[131:35.37]Oh, shoot.
[132:06.84]That guy was acting like he was on fire.
[132:12.99]Oh, man.
[132:15.53]That guy was stuck in a whirlpool.
[132:18.89]That guy was getting flushed down a toilet.
[132:21.29]How many other things can I say?
[132:22.43]I don't know.
[132:23.09]Now I feel better.
[132:23.81]I feel good now.
[132:25.95]I feel good.
[132:28.80]Somebody said that was not funny.
[132:31.70]I mean, it kind of was.
[132:34.16]It wasn't that funny, Jerma.
[132:36.06]It was kind of funny, come on.
[132:42.70]Shit.org.
[132:53.04]Guess what I was doing.
[132:55.96]No, it wasn't funny for him, that's true.
[133:01.18]Got to go up and around.
[133:03.24]I wanted to cover, you know, let's just do something here.
[133:08.38]Let's make, like, something.
[133:09.72]Let's get this guy out of the car.
[133:11.18]This guy's an experiment.
[133:13.92]I have to experiment on this guy.
[133:21.03]Come here.
[133:22.43]Oh my god.
[133:27.11]Okay, so this is the guy.
[133:28.13]I want to experiment.
[133:36.41]Alright, this guy's... He got them all off!
[133:45.58]I can't believe he fucking got them off!
[133:53.44]Is he still alive?
[134:00.55]Oh, I think they can actually get them off.
[134:06.64]I really didn't think they could actually shake that shit off.
[134:14.93]He wiggled enough times to get it off.
[134:23.47]Yeah, nobody seemed to care.
[134:24.33]I need ammo.
[134:34.31]Like, I've wasted, like, a ton of it.
[134:37.93]Alright, let's actually go do this now.
[134:43.78]Okay, let's do this.
[134:44.48]There's only one hostage.
[134:45.88]This is so far away.
[134:48.72]Let me second drive this.
[134:51.09]Let's do the hostage.
[135:01.28]Whole of one zombie, thanks for the five bucks.
[135:03.14]Again, send it in the mail.
[135:05.76]If I'm not at home, they can let themselves in.
[135:09.86]What?
[135:15.38]Can I make a shortcut?
[135:16.36]Yeah, here's a shortcut.
[135:22.15]Shortcut.
[135:24.65]Back it up.
[135:28.08]I like this message because there's only one hostage in this mission.
[135:31.44]That makes it so much better.
[135:43.80]That wasn't the thing I was supposed to destroy.
[135:45.81]I saw the three blips and I was like, oh, here we go, I'll take that out.
[135:48.75]No, not even the right thing.
[135:50.95]Can't even get that right.
[136:04.31]I just destroyed some guy's gas station for no reason.
[136:08.78]Sorry.
[136:10.88]I would say I didn't mean to, but I did absolutely mean to do that.
[136:14.64]Just didn't want to hurt you.
[136:17.73]Well, there's the bridge.
[136:19.47]Should I try it?
[136:20.81]Should I try the bridge again?
[136:21.69]I'm going to give the bridge a try.
[136:27.09]My weapons are not good enough
[136:31.98]But I'm just gonna fucking start throwing these.
[136:33.97]Who cares?
[136:34.65]At this point.
[136:39.03]Like, at this point... Like, see, I already blew it.
[136:42.01]Like, I already fucking... I've already blown it.
[136:44.77]I'm already blowing it.
[136:45.42]You know what I mean?
[136:46.02]Like, what's the point?
[136:47.30]If you already blew it, might as well just try it
[137:09.99]Drop the whole damn thing.
[137:13.79]Like, I'm just gonna do this.
[137:14.57]I don't even care.
[137:25.20]The whole thing's gonna collapse now.
[137:31.44]How are you... What are you just... You should be collapsed.
[137:33.42]You know how much weight is coming down right there?
[137:36.36]There's so much weight right there.
[137:39.69]Look at it.
[137:40.07]There's so much weight.
[137:41.51]And you're not going to fall.
[137:44.07]I don't believe that for a second.
[137:45.05]We're going to get the other side.
[137:56.29]The whole middle is going to fall out.
[138:02.46]There it goes.

[139:09.72]I can take their car.
[139:19.40]Out of the way!
[139:19.96]I can't believe I'm still alive.
[139:26.96]Why do these guys have no helmets on?
[139:28.04]Alright, where was I going?
[139:33.16]Up here somewhere?
[139:33.82]Alright, well I'll do that.

[139:52.06]Yeah, wear your helmet.
[139:56.30]Wear your damn helmets, kids.
[140:04.15]All I need now is to rip into the left and go over the edge.
[140:08.33]That would be such a bad moment.
[140:17.80]Alright, we're gonna do this Kim Possible style.
[140:24.52]Kim Possible style.
[140:25.48]We're gonna get out of here.

[141:29.01]Fucking text me, tweet me, if you wanna beep me.
[141:42.42]Almost there.

[142:14.11]I just can't help it and Holy shit these these driving missions that give you no leeway You have to do it perfect or it's not gonna happen you get like four seconds of leeway.
[142:25.49]Oh
[142:47.30]Get out of the way.
[142:49.02]I got a fucking mission to do.
[142:50.82]Did I just cut through there, probably?
[142:57.37]Yeah, of course they make you go up this, like, shitty road to end it.
[143:13.46]This stupid, bumpy, curvy, tiny road.
[143:20.01]Look, I have eight seconds to get here.
[143:27.27]I almost didn't do it.
[143:30.23]Fucking call me, greet me, if you want to speak me.
[143:39.22]Oh.
[143:46.64]Well, I can now buy those.
[143:55.33]It's not funny at all.
[143:57.43]I'm sorry, dude.
[144:00.15]You might be new to the stream, but I don't even care if I'm funny.
[144:03.87]For instance, I know this is not funny.
[144:07.11]I'm not trying to be funny.
[144:08.97]I'm just saying words and hitting a guy with a hammer.
[144:13.12]Me trying to be funny is like this.
[144:14.62]Me trying to tell a propaganda joke.
[144:17.64]It's not going to happen.
[144:18.54]What am I going to say?
[144:20.80]Nothing.
[144:26.08]Insecure streamer.
[144:28.65]What do these things even do?
[144:30.43]I don't know.
[144:31.35]What else do I have to do?
[144:55.06]There's not a whole lot of... I mean, I guess I got to find another building to get rid of?
[145:00.59]There's 70 points left.
[145:03.51]Control 30.
[145:06.83]Control 100.
[145:08.13]Salvage 100.
[145:08.51]Control 10.
[145:11.11]Control 25.
[145:11.85]I just have to do some of these.
[145:13.81]I really don't want to, though.
[145:16.81]Look at this one.
[145:32.81]Whoops.
[145:35.73]Uh, straight down here.
[145:36.65]I actually do need to destroy that propaganda.
[145:40.57]Like, I actually have to do that.
[145:56.21]What?
[145:57.81]Did that guy say, you missed, motherfucker?
[146:02.40]Alright.
[146:12.83]Hey, I like this game.
[146:13.99]I like you.
[146:14.43]This is a good combo.
[146:16.01]This game is very good.
[146:19.75]Actually, I have to do this now.
[146:21.25]Like, I can't fuck around.
[146:22.63]Gotta beat this.
[146:25.23]We need to lose a little bit of the control here.
[146:32.01]I need a better car.
[146:45.43]Hmm.
[146:46.75]Maybe I don't even need a car.
[146:49.45]I'm already there.
[146:51.21]It's like in that building.
[146:52.07]There's a ton of people in that building too.
[146:57.87]Hmm.
[146:58.01]Hmm.
[147:13.23]Why even do anything else?
[147:22.23]Why ever do anything else?
[147:24.59]The melee is the best shit in the whole game.
[147:41.69]Okay, we're good.
[147:42.99]Alright, hostages, there's two.
[147:47.39]Where are they?
[147:49.31]Upstairs, probably.
[147:50.62]Yeah, there's... Right through the fucking window.
[147:59.38]One more... One more flight of stairs?
[148:00.74]Yep.
[148:10.71]That spin kicked me.
[148:11.77]Alright, let's get down.
[148:15.75]A lot of people coming this way.
[148:19.85]I'm just gonna snipe them out.
[148:27.55]Couple more.
[148:28.19]Alright, you guys gotta get down.
[148:29.40]I'm gonna find a way to get these guys to get down.
[148:32.84]There's so many people coming.
[148:42.39]So many fucking people.
[148:44.76]Come on, this way.
[148:45.38]Follow me.
[148:51.18]God, they don't make this easy, do they?
[148:52.80]Honestly, God.
[148:53.49]I'm just surrounded.
[148:54.13]I'm just surrounded on all sides.
[149:09.75]Jesus, man, like, how do they ever expect you to get anybody out of here?
[149:17.76]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[149:22.01]Look at the, I'm, like, they're gonna die.
[149:32.01]There's fucking 50 people on all sides.
[149:35.71]I'm convinced these missions are impossible to do.
[149:39.14]Unless you have three friends playing with you.
[149:41.16]Is this multiplayer?
[149:42.40]Where are my multiplayer friends?
[149:44.74]I'm just gonna run.
[149:45.20]There's nothing else I can do.
[149:46.60]I just have to go this way.
[149:48.92]We have to run through the 400 people.
[149:51.54]Go.
[149:52.62]He's gonna die.
[149:55.78]Keep going.
[150:03.48]are you supposed to do I don't like I've yet to understand this I really don't get it you go in and you you you press e on two or three people and then a hundred people are around the building what's the solution I have to just drive into the fucking building with a car
[150:31.38]I'm going to drive into the building.
[150:32.90]Like, straight into it.
[150:36.94]There's only two seats here.
[150:37.92]Can the guy fit in the taxi?
[150:43.00]Can I get more than one person in here?
[150:44.16]I need to sit down and play cards.
[150:59.85]There's already like a shitload of people in the building.
[151:03.75]So let's like go park in front of the building and just get in the car.
[151:07.29]Just go press E quick on two people and then get in car, strive.
[151:11.64]Okay, here we go.
[151:27.99]Press E, please.
[151:28.71]No!
[151:29.09]Oh my god, damn it, you idiot.
[151:37.65]Don't die.
[151:47.34]Come on, man.
[151:49.36]And now here they all are.
[151:50.48]They're all like, this is... I swear to god.
[151:55.53]I swear to fucking god.
[151:59.53]Give me a fucking break.
[152:06.51]And like now the whole building is broken.
[152:08.45]I can't even get up the fucking stairs.
[152:13.17]I can't untie this guy.
[152:14.65]There we go.
[152:15.11]I'm gonna fall through.
[152:18.31]That guy's dead.
[152:19.25]And now the whole building is surrounded again.
[152:22.73]Get the fuck out of here.
[152:23.67]Fuck this stupid fucking mission.
[152:25.23]I just ran the last time and the guy got riddled with bullets and I lost the mission.
[152:53.26]I ran out of the building and tried to run to a car.
[152:57.09]And the guy was just like... Got absolutely riddled with bullets and died.
[153:13.02]He stood up in an open window.
[153:16.15]I'm gonna like, I'm gonna turn this car.
[153:17.91]Is that a security guard or what?
[153:20.19]Fucking idiot.
[153:21.33]And now they heard that noise.
[153:23.47]Here we go.
[153:24.59]I'm turning this way.
[153:26.88]This car is like parked right there.
[153:37.44]Not today.
[153:38.32]Not today.
[153:39.40]You okay?
[153:40.31]I'm here to help you.
[153:44.33]You can fight for yourself.
[153:45.71]I have faith.
[153:54.05]Into the car.
[154:00.92]Get in the car.
[154:05.16]Where's the other guy?
[154:06.79]Get in the car.
[154:08.87]He's still in the building.
[154:13.53]He's not coming out of the building.
[154:16.07]I'm wedged under the stairs.
[154:21.63]Why is he not coming out?
[154:24.05]He won't fucking leave the building.
[154:26.82]Why is he standing in there?
[154:32.00]Yeah, no shit.
[154:36.16]Oh my lord in heaven.
[154:40.97]Destructible environments.
[154:42.03]Yeah, but he can just like, why can't he just like elbow the side of the wall?
[154:57.84]He's just dead.
[154:59.92]He got stuck somewhere and was like, you know what?
[155:02.26]I think this is a better idea than leaving.
[155:09.86]That killed this lady.
[155:13.13]I would have just thrown up.
[155:21.84]Complete.
[155:22.42]Minus 25.
[155:22.70]Well, not very much left.
[155:24.54]Let's do this one.
[155:29.43]This is control 10.
[155:31.35]We need more than that.
[155:32.55]This is control 25.
[155:37.28]I think I have to do these.
[155:39.39]What about this one?
[155:40.37]Salvage 75.
[155:42.59]Control 40.
[155:43.81]These ones are so worth doing, but they're so boring.
[155:49.11]Alright, let's do this one and then the one after it.
[155:53.79]I'm getting rid of this weapon, though.
[155:54.71]I don't like this thing.
[155:55.48]Let's get back to the rocket launcher.
[156:00.38]Oh, I have a sniper rifle now.
[156:04.70]Let's put on the sniper.
[156:06.04]Give it a try.
[156:12.62]Might as well use it.
[156:17.01]Let's just get on the road.
[156:22.05]Float!
[156:23.79]Okay.
[156:26.11]I don't want to taxi.
[156:26.81]Those things are bad.
[156:27.59]I'm going to do the thing that I always used to do in GTA, and that's just sit in the road and wait for a really nice car.
[156:43.97]Mmm, good enough.
[156:46.27]Close the door.
[156:52.12]Okay.
[156:57.74]Destroy stuff?
[156:58.78]Yeah, I haven't seen any red... Significant red blips.
[157:04.01]This area is very mountain-y.
[157:05.63]There's not a whole lot of... EDF-controlled areas, it seems.
[157:11.81]It's a bunch of roads going through mountains.
[157:19.20]Taking this guy's car at least twice.
[157:21.10]Probably.
[157:21.54]Let's go do the defend mission.
[157:31.48]And get some control.
[157:35.58]Guess we're just going to get inside of this thing because here it is.
[157:44.89]Destroy the EDF soldiers.
[157:49.93]Okay.
[157:50.25]Are they just gonna pour around this corner?
[157:57.77]Alright, well this is easy.
[158:08.56]Oh no, they're coming from behind now.
[158:17.54]Cool it, cool it, cool it.
[158:21.25]It's a very slow turning machine.
[158:28.66]Turn.
[158:32.18]Got it.
[158:33.22]Flipped it.
[158:33.60]125 people need to die.
[158:51.89]I mean, I guess this is just gonna be sit here and spam.
[159:00.65]Hi guys.
[159:13.14]I don't even know what I'm shooting at.
[159:15.50]I guess I'm doing it okay.
[159:30.97]45 almost there halfway just about a little more need a little more to be halfway Turn please
[159:56.12]Another one dead.
[159:56.76]This way.
[160:08.93]They slowed down.
[160:09.69]I thought they were going to be coming way more fierce than they are now.
[160:34.43]I don't want to do this again I feel like they could have ended this at like 60 and it would have been just as fun
[160:59.30]It's not very much danger either.
[161:00.63]I'm kind of just like a crab that has infinite ammo.
[161:05.29]Nobody can really stop me.
[161:16.22]I say that now and now I'm getting like bombarded on all sides.
[161:23.83]Oh god.
[161:24.77]Oh god.
[161:25.25]This is actually getting to be too much.
[161:26.53]I gotta walk this way.
[161:34.68]Okay, now turn.
[161:36.70]So they don't, like, ramp up on me.
[161:37.98]Can you just say, if you stop now, you will not be harmed?
[161:52.59]Uh, I don't think that's gonna happen, man.
[162:04.61]112 113 14 not very much longer I can't imagine like failing this and having to do this again.
[162:17.87]I would be very very upset about that
[162:31.09]Alright, that's it.
[162:32.71]Finish it.
[162:33.61]Come on.
[162:34.49]End it.
[162:38.47]25.
[162:38.49]Done.
[162:44.80]How was that for excitement, guys?
[162:47.28]That's the most exciting thing I think I've ever done.
[162:48.96]I'm going to travel here just to get full ammo.
[162:57.92]And go.
[163:04.13]This is far away, but it's going to be worth it because this is going to be it.
[163:06.29]And we can do the last mission here.
[163:14.64]So exciting.
[163:15.56]Rest in sleep.
[163:18.22]It was necessary.
[163:19.06]We had to do it.
[163:20.62]Don't explode.
[163:22.48]Thank you.
[163:25.95]We got to get one guy out.
[163:28.25]Is it really going to be that difficult?
[163:29.75]It can't be that hard, right?
[163:32.51]One person.
[163:38.05]I'm gonna go speedrun strategy, just same thing we did last time.

[166:52.90]This is a tent stream.
[166:56.42]I'm turning on, like, shoot person mode.
[167:02.36]I wasn't about to lose that.
[167:03.98]No way.
[167:06.00]Not a chance.

[168:49.96]I'm surprised none of these are controlled by ADF.
[168:55.27]Oddly enough.
[168:55.81]Is there anything else I can do over here?
[169:13.14]Not really.
[169:16.57]Up and to the left is all I can really think of.
[169:21.93]Let's take a turn.
[169:22.83]We just need to destroy one thing.
[169:24.09]Is that propaganda?
[169:25.11]I think this is propaganda right there, right?
[169:36.28]Plus five.
[169:37.06]Didn't really do anything for me.
[169:45.28]What about a... Actually, I didn't explore that area.
[169:55.20]There's a little spot that looks like it's to the left over... Like, to the right now.
[170:01.06]Can I go down there?
[170:05.46]No.
[170:07.44]Shit!
[170:14.89]Where?
[170:18.99]Let's do this.
[170:19.59]It's right here.
[170:20.13]It's ready.
[170:24.07]Give me the path.
[170:28.31]This will get us to full control of what we need.
[170:33.39]Have I heard of Breath of the Wild?
[170:34.51]I mean, yeah.
[170:36.38]Legend of Zelda, man.
[170:39.32]Fire-breathing wild.
[170:46.36]Alright, I'm here.
[170:48.26]I'm here to save us.
[170:52.30]Protect the red faction.
[170:59.03]Alright.
[171:00.93]Who's attacking?
[171:01.56]I don't see anybody attacking yet.
[171:14.74]I hear them shooting at something.
[171:16.92]Right here?
[171:29.57]They all duck when I aim down sights.
[171:31.79]They all duck with the sniper rifle.
[171:33.17]Are they all falling off the cliff or something?
[171:34.79]Oh, it's the guy on the minigun.
[172:05.44]Get out of my screen.
[172:06.22]I'm not fucking around.
[172:16.96]12!
[172:17.42]12 more people.
[172:28.96]Oh shit.
[172:39.83]Oh, come on.
[172:40.19]I got it right in the head.
[172:42.09]Other side?
[172:42.57]And we're currently winning, but... Damn.
[173:09.01]Come on.
[173:14.26]How many more of you assholes do I have to get rid of?
[173:15.74]I'm gonna have to start picking up guns.
[173:24.03]I'm running out of ammo.
[173:38.60]I need to start picking guns up.
[173:44.69]Only four people left.
[173:45.53]I think I can get it.
[173:51.13]How did they even get up here that quickly?
[173:58.17]Fucking no scope the last guy.
[174:00.59]No scope the last fucking guy.
[174:03.03]Yeah, break.
[174:11.22]Didn't even need to zoom in on that guy.
[174:17.42]He had such an awesome death animation too.
[174:25.22]That's an old meme.
[174:26.56]What?
[174:29.00]That's one of those stupid things from video games.
[174:31.44]It'll never die, man.
[174:37.63]Okay, so where is this?
[174:38.53]Down here?
[174:39.41]Fast travel.
[174:47.58]Jesus.
[174:50.52]What was that?
[174:50.98]Do I have enough salvage to do anything?
[174:56.64]Remote charge count.
[175:01.52]Rocket ammo.
[175:06.96]Massive explosion.
[175:08.08]Quantum multiplier.
[175:14.26]I don't know what to do.
[175:14.98]More rocket ammo?
[175:15.58]I'm going to do that.
[175:18.43]Don't put the rocket on.
[175:22.49]The next thing I'm going to get is I'll get the nuke.
[175:24.13]That's the next thing I'll get.
[175:25.63]I'll save up for that now, but I want more ammo in my gun.
[175:30.98]Where is the locker here?
[175:37.90]Yeah, that's fine.
[175:38.92]I don't want the assault rifle anymore.
[175:40.92]18, that's good.
[175:44.88]Keep that weapon.
[175:46.94]Alright.
[175:50.77]Okay.
[175:52.45]I think I'm ready to play this game.
[175:56.27]Let's do one of these missions.
[176:02.13]last one we're on the verge of driving our enemy off the surface of mars we have the nano forge and soon we'll have eos council will then have to make a choice accept peace on our terms or continue a war too costly to fight we're launching a massive coordinated strike on positions in the eos sector is this the last mission you'll be heading up the assault on the edf central command
[176:25.96]Am I going to beat the game tonight?
[176:26.96]Yes.
[176:27.48]We're going to go until the game is over.
[176:29.64]Which might be, like, right now.
[176:36.91]Pick up Gorilla Squad.
[176:38.07]In the shitty taxi.
[176:38.81]It's not over yet.
[176:39.57]Okay.
[176:39.85]Well, I'm here until it's over.
[176:58.60]I wanted to do a stream tonight just to make sure I could get this done.
[177:02.10]Because I think it's a really fun game.
[177:07.50]But I don't just only want to play Red Faction Guerrilla.
[177:13.88]And I've streamed this pretty much exclusively the last three full streams in a row.
[177:17.57]So I figured we'd get it done.
[177:38.13]Alright, would this have taken just as long to go around?
[177:42.77]Why'd you put the rocks here?
[177:44.55]Just pretend this is the same car.
[177:53.42]It's the same car.
[177:59.38]I made it up.
[178:06.40]What does this GPS tell me to go?
[178:08.48]Alright, just pretend I did that.
[178:12.97]Just pretend like I went this way.
[178:17.57]Stupid mountain.
[178:18.67]Dumb mountain zone.
[178:22.36]Why would the... Same car, same problem.
[178:32.46]Stop in the name of the law.
[178:41.60]You see what I'm talking about?
[178:42.52]Like, where is this wanting me to even go?
[178:46.40]It's, like, all over the place.
[178:52.56]Entering Free Fire Zone.
[178:59.08]Oh, no.
[179:02.71]Confessing my hatred of nature.
[179:04.53]What do you mean, hatred of nature?
[179:14.43]This is very far away.
[179:18.01]You guys couldn't have driven up here and met me halfway?
[179:20.41]What's up with, like, friends that don't do that shit, by the way?
[179:23.03]You got any friend that lives really far away and they always want to do something with you?
[179:28.40]Yeah, just, uh, what do you want to do?
[179:29.60]I don't know, man.
[179:30.82]You want to, like, hang out?
[179:31.62]You want to do something?
[179:32.80]Yara!
[179:33.60]You want to come over here?
[179:34.92]Like, come get me?
[179:37.72]You live, like, an hour and 40 minutes away, man.
[179:39.64]You want to, like, meet me halfway?
[179:42.30]I don't know if I can.
[179:43.90]You want to meet me over here?
[179:48.12]Sure.
[179:49.46]See you in like three hours.
[179:52.89]Like, no, let's meet at like the Papagino's.
[179:56.11]That's like an hour away from both of us.
[179:58.45]And then let's go to like eat or something.
[180:11.63]We're going to meet at Puppagino's and we're going to discuss politics at Puppagino's.
[180:17.68]Alright, entering dust.
[180:24.04]We're almost there.
[180:28.42]Have that friend play this mission.
[180:30.10]... ...
[180:43.73]Almost there.
[180:44.23]There's a bridge.
[180:48.03]One of the many bridges in the game that we did not destroy.
[180:50.19]Alright, so if this really is one of those come-get-me-I'm-your-friend-that-lives-far-away missions, I'm gonna laugh.
[181:03.33]If we pick these guys up and we have to go all the way back to the top left of the area of the map, then it's funny.
[181:09.11]We'll see.
[181:16.45]They are okay guys.
[181:17.59]I don't drive the car.
[181:20.07]That's next to you or anything Mm-hmm Yeah, you know the same car All right picked him up picked up my friend Go to the rally point
[181:46.00]Alright, I mean, they did meet me halfway.
[181:48.48]They did.
[181:48.90]They met me halfway.
[181:50.18]This is their car.
[181:51.68]They came halfway.
[181:53.46]Now we're gonna go, like, to where we're going.
[181:56.97]They actually did meet me halfway to hang out.
[182:05.81]What?
[182:07.45]What's going on?
[182:08.07]What the hell happened?
[182:16.73]What?
[182:18.95]What the hell?
[182:20.47]Not one of... We're going to the same place.
[182:25.07]Three minutes to get there?
[182:30.40]What the hell?
[182:31.72]Another long-ass drive, and this time it's timed.
[182:35.32]I do not want to do this whole thing again, so I'm going to make this... I'm going to be quiet.
[182:39.66]I'm going to shut the fuck up, and I'm going to do this right.
[182:43.54]No chance I'm doing this whole thing again.
[182:56.95]Shave a little time off her.
[183:05.22]That's a straight line.
[183:05.92]That's much better.
[183:21.15]That's a right call.
[183:23.07]What's the right call?
[183:23.89]Puppaginos is under attack.
[183:27.29]Puppaginos.
[183:32.80]Did you hear this person gasping?
[183:37.46]We gotta get to the Puppaginos!
[183:47.74]Holy shit.
[183:48.96]They really are like stealth bombing this place.
[183:56.19]No, don't even get out.
[183:57.99]Just get there.
[183:58.51]I don't want to do this time thing again And they bombed HQ Don't take my GPS off the screen
[184:20.63]Don't take my GPS off the screen, please.
[184:23.41]What?
[184:32.51]Man, let's, like, snake under this.
[184:40.02]Alright, we can just get out.
[184:41.04]Everybody get out.
[184:41.80]Like, it's time to fight.
[184:48.42]The commander is dead.
[184:52.92]I just fucking disintegrated one of my own guys.
[184:55.03]Now what?
[185:09.96]I'm gonna go up here?
[185:13.50]Friendly fire.
[185:14.18]Well, friendly fire is only a problem when they literally walk in front of you.
[185:23.38]Why is that happening?
[185:26.94]Get up.
[185:27.68]There's no reason for why that just happened.
[185:36.95]Almost there.
[185:44.41]I think I got that down pretty well.
[185:48.83]Get out of the way!
[186:02.52]Killing spree.
[186:05.66]Protect Sam.
[186:08.35]Okay.
[186:09.43]I'll try.
[186:19.43]No, I don't have anything else, man.
[186:34.66]Come, like, hide over here.
[186:36.00]Why are we standing in the open?
[186:44.99]How long do I have to do this for?
[186:47.95]Where the fuck did he come from?
[186:57.38]I might have to pick up somebody's weapon here.
[187:01.88]Where's he at?
[187:10.36]Back it up.
[187:10.70]Back it up.
[187:11.02]Back it up.
[187:11.32]Back it up.
[187:11.80]Back it up.
[187:12.70]Back it up.
[187:22.33]I don't want to accidentally hit somebody in the fucking head here.
[187:32.77]This thing sucks.
[187:44.32]This thing's horrible.
[187:52.12]Did I just kill Sam?
[187:53.02]No, I didn't.
[187:53.76]Did I?
[187:54.86]Okay, go ahead, because she's alive.
[188:05.11]How long is this mission going to go on for?
[188:19.14]Where is he?
[188:19.46]Where is he?
[188:23.01]Damn it!
[188:25.49]Get it!
[188:31.88]Ah!
[188:55.39]Alright, this is like ridiculous, man.
[188:59.89]I can't see anything.
[189:01.47]You guys have fucking smoke grenades.
[189:07.55]Wow.
[189:09.83]Okay, I had to be like quiet there.
[189:16.65]Oh no.
[189:24.11]All of my friends are gone.
[189:28.81]What do we do now?
[189:30.02]I... I don't know.
[189:32.72]Just a second to think.
[189:33.78]Everyone's dead.
[189:35.18]The commander's dead.
[189:37.42]We need a plan.
[189:40.39]Okay.
[189:41.05]We need to get all the blankets.
[189:43.95]We still have the rifle and the nanoforge.
[189:46.25]You're right.
[189:48.00]That was a really weird face.
[189:50.50]I've got to get new media drivers.
[189:53.02]We need the Marauders' help.
[190:19.86]What?
[190:21.62]She's a fucking marauder.
[190:23.18]Did her accent just change?
[190:26.42]That's just a piece of metal.
[190:29.04]We need salvage.
[190:48.51]That wasn't even a betrayal.
[190:49.43]That was just like a piece of information that doesn't really matter.
[190:52.76]Alright, well.
[191:00.32]Thank you, Officer Anvil, for the 10 bucks.
[191:02.46]Can you meet me halfway?
[191:03.54]Right on the borderline is where I'm gonna wait.
[191:08.75]New unlocks.
[191:11.63]Radiation shielding.
[191:14.13]Interesting.
[191:14.61]We got a new mission.
[191:20.58]All the way down here.
[191:21.32]Okay.
[191:24.82]Let's go back.
[191:35.19]Excuse me.
[191:36.69]Let's take a look.
[191:41.26]I don't have any salvage.
[191:45.20]Unfortunately for me.
[191:49.56]I do want to get... I don't like this weapon.
[191:51.26]I want to replace it.
[191:59.18]I want to replace it with... Oh, the nano rifle is just... It's so good.
[192:07.03]It just really is.
[192:07.73]And I have it upgraded.
[192:09.39]Might as well just use it.
[192:10.35]I used one hit kill on anyone.
[192:13.21]It's really, really good stuff.
[192:19.37]So we're going... This is so far away.
[192:29.55]Keep on moving.
[192:36.71]Is this game any fun?
[192:37.69]I bought it but never played it.
[192:39.60]It is very fun.
[192:41.56]If you like just breaking stuff... There's a guy in the back of this dump truck.
[192:50.15]Of all the places for you to be.
[192:53.67]If you like breaking stuff, this is the game where you break stuff.
[193:04.95]This is a long way... Wait a minute.
[193:17.34]Wait a second.
[193:21.37]I ain't going here.
[193:22.19]I don't think I can go here.
[193:23.21]I think this is why you have the radiation suit.
[193:29.15]Why would it say, like, radiation zone?
[193:31.02]No, we're not going here.
[193:31.88]This is a long way away, too.
[193:34.14]How much scrap do I need?
[193:34.98]I'm gonna do this.
[193:39.02]Nope.
[193:44.06]That's way too far of a drive.
[193:47.36]I'm sure it's perfectly safe.
[193:56.46]Get the car, get 50 salvage and see how much we need.
[194:05.19]I'm evolving.
[194:08.57]Oi!
[194:09.65]Deckhead!
[194:11.37]I'm already very much evolved.
[194:14.74]I am an enlightened being.
[194:15.94]This receiver just went off.
[194:19.88]You know, I've actually been told by scientists that they can't even measure my intelligence because it's so extreme that they can't even measure it.
[194:31.87]I looked at a guy one time that was a scientist and he was doing a staring contest with me.
[194:36.56]He was like, I can tell how smart you are by doing a staring contest.
[194:40.50]I burnt his fucking eyes out, like Cyclops style.
[194:51.75]You guys seen how big my head is?
[194:53.03]If I shave my head, it's huge.
[195:00.83]Thankfully, this one was really easy.
[195:09.43]I got an extra second.
[195:10.41]Did you see that?
[195:11.77]I got an extra fucking second.
[195:14.61]Thanks for the free second, man.
[195:15.91]Alright, how much do I need to get that radiation suit?
[195:22.51]Radiation shielding I need like nothing that's gonna break a couple things Let me just like smash a random thing One of these block come on just let me get I need like ten I think something's stupid Break this guy's projector No, oh Did I hit that that far?
[195:45.32]Oh my god
[195:51.89]I need to go find, like, a dumb car or something.
[195:53.64]There's nothing there.
[195:57.86]I thought I was going to be able to grab some, but... What about this pile of junk?
[196:12.06]Oh, you're just a display.
[196:13.02]What the hell was that?
[196:20.94]I'm trying to get, like, 10 scrap very quickly.
[196:27.26]Hey, look.
[196:27.56]That's not even scrap.
[196:30.71]Don't look.
[196:36.31]Car ghosts.
[196:39.19]Ooh!
[196:40.02]Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to find the Moab.
[196:49.67]That's a bouncy move.
[196:52.11]Time to find the location of the MOAB.
[196:56.93]It's obviously a dev on the game, by the way.
[197:04.33]Location of the MOAB has been added to your map.
[197:06.17]Drive any vehicle over this location to equip the bomb.
[197:12.45]Right here.
[197:14.90]That's where it is the whole time.
[197:17.08]It's just there.
[197:20.75]So, what am I supposed to do with this?
[197:32.78]Alright, everyone's yelling at me to save the game.
[197:35.06]I'll save the game right here.
[197:40.15]Okay, where is it?
[197:46.05]That's it?
[197:47.85]It's just sticking out of the ground right here?
[197:58.12]Oh.
[197:59.09]Require a vehicle to set Moab.
[198:00.65]What?
[198:00.85]I don't know.
[198:01.17]What?
[198:03.85]Set Moab.
[198:06.17]Destroy the vehicle to unleash the Moab.
[198:12.15]Are you kidding me?
[198:17.46]It's just a gigantic car explosion, huh?
[198:25.44]Okay, well, I got to hold on to this car.
[198:42.76]All of a sudden, just boom.
[198:45.12]That would have been so stupid.
[198:46.55]All right, I need to get... Let's just go this way.
[198:49.37]I need some salvage.
[198:56.28]Destroy the bridge.
[198:58.52]Don't overwrite that save.
[198:59.76]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[199:00.70]I won't.
[199:03.22]Bridge.
[199:03.54]What bridge?
[199:04.00]I already blew up the bridge.
[199:05.24]I already took out the bridge.
[199:06.68]There's no more real bridges to take care of.
[199:09.23]Unless there's some of the bridge I don't know about.
[199:13.41]Alright, there's another thing over here.
[199:15.31]Is there another mother of all bombs?
[199:23.05]Why do you have to keep getting these?
[199:28.97]Two more radio attacks for another MOAB.
[199:30.71]Okay, so you get more than one MOAB, apparently.
[199:36.50]Brace yourself for a funny joke.
[199:41.20]We'll see about that.
[199:45.99]And I was looking for salvage, and I sure did find it.
[199:56.67]And then we can go back.
[199:59.78]I already have enough for it.
[200:09.81]$100 joke is coming up soon.
[200:12.87]I don't know.
[200:13.61]How big is the explosion?
[200:14.63]Is it just like a rocket?
[200:16.38]Or is it an actual nuke?
[200:19.36]Does a nuke explode on the screen?
[200:32.26]It's small.
[200:33.50]Oh.
[200:35.28]Somebody said it's a nuke.
[200:37.48]Well, which one is it?
[200:38.86]We'll have to find out.
[200:39.72]Okay, that's fine.
[200:47.69]Get this last one.
[200:54.01]Tactical joke inbound.
[200:59.20]So when the car reaches 0 HP is when it explodes.
[201:02.01]Well, I should probably just turn around.
[201:08.07]Because I have enough salvage.
[201:10.71]But we have not explored this area yet, so I'm going to do it.
[201:23.81]What is even up here?
[201:27.73]So many of these things.
[201:29.05]I want to stop and get them, but I don't at the same time.
[201:35.56]Just throw some remote charges on it and send it somewhere.
[201:46.73]I have a feeling I'm going into enemy territory right now and it's going to explode.
[201:52.25]See, it's just one of these dumb missions.
[201:53.59]Alright, well...
[201:56.57]I can't fast travel.
[201:57.67]Because I don't want to lose this.
[202:00.95]So... Okay.
[202:06.09]Be careful here.
[202:07.31]This is a big, big, big mistake.
[202:19.76]We're good.
[202:26.81]Just reload the save.
[202:27.77]No, I'm sorry.
[202:28.45]It's right here.
[202:33.43]Save, then blow it up.
[202:39.55]No explosion.
[202:40.55]Resonance sliver.
[202:43.68]You'll see it soon enough.
[202:47.62]Just gotta get it in the right spot.
[202:51.70]And then go...
[202:56.37]Once we get the... We'll be good.
[203:03.43]This car is not going to disappear, right?
[203:10.29]Let's get the radiation thing.
[203:14.79]Radiation shielding.
[203:19.35]Good.
[203:19.47]Thanks.
[203:45.78]Yeah.
[203:55.56]What?
[203:57.18]Wait.
[203:58.28]Did I... I... What?
[204:04.19]I didn't save it?
[204:08.17]Or... Hold on.
[204:09.55]Am I losing my mind here?
[204:10.51]I saved it right there, didn't I?
[204:17.65]You guys saw that.
[204:18.61]I saved the game right there.
[204:19.95]2307.
[204:20.99]Yeah, that was one minute ago.
[204:30.17]What?
[204:30.84]Okay.
[204:31.14]Well, that's weird.
[204:33.34]Wrong save.
[204:33.94]No, I made that save literally one minute ago.
[204:40.52]Well, I guess we're going to get it on the way there.
[204:52.07]On the way to the Irradiated Field.
[205:01.44]Just drive over it.
[205:02.40]It's that easy.
[205:07.68]Hello.
[205:10.38]Driving over it is... It's that easy to install the damn thing.
[205:12.89]Alright, we gotta drive.
[205:20.19]So what what do we got for a time on the game time left?
[205:25.48]Was it like one or two more missions in the game something like that?
[205:31.24]Got to be getting to the near the end of the game right I assume 50 more hours
[205:46.87]Two to three hours.
[205:48.34]Are you serious?
[205:49.50]Holy shit.
[205:53.34]I thought, like, we were at the end of the game.
[205:54.56]There's an infinite number of quests.
[206:08.89]We might have to stream this game tomorrow.
[206:16.84]So this is Marauder Land, okay.
[206:30.42]There we are.
[206:32.30]Through here, through here.
[206:33.84]You just want me to do the last mission so bad?
[206:43.70]Well, that's fine.
[206:44.38]I have the radiation shield.
[206:48.56]So I'm not concerned about this at all.
[206:56.02]Take the photos of Marauderland.
[207:00.06]Marauderland has a lot of nodes, too.
[207:04.55]By the way, I love how I'm just driving a bomb through this.
[207:07.03]This is not a good idea.
[207:13.27]What the hell was that?
[207:16.65]No.
[207:17.17]Okay, I got a bomb here.
[207:18.47]This is not good.
[207:20.97]I can't... I can't let them destroy this.
[207:30.05]So if the girl is a... If that girl is a marauder, right?
[207:34.29]How come these guys are attacking me?
[207:37.65]I'm surrounded by marauders.
[207:41.11]There's more marauders than I've ever seen in the game.
[207:43.27]I've never seen this many enemies on the screen.
[207:52.03]What did this GPS take me?
[207:56.52]Like, what kind of GPS is this?
[207:59.16]I wanted to go over here.
[208:00.82]He's incoming!
[208:11.14]Where did this GPS bring me?
[208:14.17]It brought me like not even halfway to where I need to go.
[208:20.97]I don't want to go there.
[208:34.28]Where on earth... It's like around this way?
[208:48.12]Well, I guess I found it.
[208:49.96]I figured it out, apparently.
[208:51.18]Hi guys, don't mind me.
[208:57.03]Just like coming into Marauderland.
[209:00.55]Oh god, this is gonna blow up.
[209:04.77]Oh god, no.
[209:05.93]Fucking just nuke it, who cares?
[209:21.03]I just dropped a nuke outside and we're just like, you know, just meet with the leader.
[209:27.97]What else am I supposed to use it?
[209:37.79]Like, I would love to use it.
[209:38.78]Why are we getting shot at by these people?
[209:44.00]Shouldn't I not be driving through this and get attacked by a fucking hundred people?
[209:50.43]He defiles this place.
[209:52.63]Well, I guess you got all the charm.
[209:55.23]You, show us the forge.
[209:57.29]Not until we have a deal.
[209:59.85]With the forge, we can destroy the Hydra.
[210:02.93]A ship in orbit is too distant.
[210:05.29]Not if you bring the accelerator online.
[210:07.76]The show would have the velocity to reach its target.
[210:11.02]It is not impossible.
[210:14.18]Are these supposed to be aliens or are they supposed to be humans?
[210:17.82]He is not one of us.
[210:43.17]I've killed a lot of these people.
[210:44.37]Mars?
[210:44.59]We're on Mars.
[210:46.83]Are we led to believe that this is the native people that live on Mars?
[211:13.73]How does that make any sense?
[211:15.85]She's a marauder.
[211:16.89]She's a regular person.
[211:19.95]Are the marauders just regular people that came here a thousand years ago or something?
[211:29.10]Well, that's fine.
[211:33.48]So now what?
[211:36.42]Now what do you want to do?
[211:39.73]Oh my god.
[211:40.51]We gotta go all the way back over here?
[211:51.81]Every time I teleport to here, there's a gigantic explosion.
[212:00.64]There's a mission right here.
[212:11.53]Elon Musk was the first marauder.
[212:14.55]Elon, Elon, Elon, Elon Musk.
[212:16.59]Elon Musk.
[212:19.24]Elon Musk.
[212:20.42]Elon Musk.
[212:20.90]Elon.
[212:21.14]It's Elon.
[212:21.64]Elon Musk.
[212:22.50]Elon DeGeneres Musk.
[212:24.16]How do you pronounce it?
[212:26.00]Is it A-lon?
[212:26.54]Alan?
[212:51.31]Elan?
[212:53.10]Elon?
[212:58.44]Elon?
[213:00.28]No, it's Elon Musk, not Elon.
[213:05.61]It's a hard E. Elon.
[213:08.61]Good luck, Mason.
[213:15.29]Elon.
[213:24.53]Fucking Elon Musk.
[213:29.28]No, I don't want to.
[213:29.76]Let's get this other car.
[213:32.94]Go to the voice of Mars and broadcast.
[213:34.90]Go, go.
[213:35.38]Elon.
[213:35.74]Now, Reese's Pieces.
[213:51.45]Elon Musk, Reese's, Elon, Elon, Reese's, Reese's.
[213:55.03]It's the same thing we're talking about.
[213:57.41]No difference.
[214:05.30]How far away are we going?
[214:06.16]Right up here.
[214:14.42]How do you pronounce Mario?
[214:17.42]Mario.
[214:18.74]Like Super Mario.
[214:20.79]Some people say Mario.
[214:22.87]That's fine.
[214:25.79]Just gonna stay on the road.
[214:30.39]That's fine.
[214:30.85]Some people say Super Mario.
[214:34.81]Should we denounce those people?
[214:37.05]Should we say, like, don't say Mario?
[214:41.63]How do you say mayonnaise?
[214:42.73]Mayonnaise.
[214:43.35]Some people say mayonnaise.
[214:46.43]Like mayonnaise.
[214:47.31]No, it's mayonnaise.
[214:48.89]M-A-Y-N-A-I-S-E.
[214:52.80]Mayonnaise.

[216:36.44]My frames are dying here.
[216:46.34]Why is it just these guys that are doing this?
[216:49.02]Seems odd.
[216:59.99]Oh, he almost just did it.
[217:12.09]I'm at like fucking 12 frames a second when I turn my corner.
[217:15.48]One more.
[217:15.78]Goodbye.
[217:16.36]Bad PC.
[217:18.04]These guys, seriously.
[217:21.04]What is it, like a grenade?
[217:43.14]Where are you?
[217:48.34]I know, there's just a couple of idiots that just run straight at you.
[217:54.04]And they point.
[218:00.93]Alright.
[218:06.69]You know, you could have made your point much faster than this.
[218:11.59]Where's the TLDR?
[218:17.56]We're like in a rush and you made like a five minute gameplay commentary.
[218:22.89]Where's this last person?
[218:34.25]Down here?
[218:34.63]Alright, like wrap it up.
[218:44.42]Let's go.
[218:49.18]We did it.
[218:53.72]That was good.
[218:54.52]Let's get out of here.
[218:59.52]Four score and seven years ago.
[219:03.40]All she could have said was, hey, guys, like, I'm a marauder.
[219:08.62]And we're in deep trouble.
[219:11.62]Follow the resistance.
[219:13.45]Follow the resistance on Twitter.
[219:24.13]Oh, boy.
[219:25.85]Oh, boy.
[219:30.00]Can I... Is that dead?
[219:33.70]Is that dead down there?
[219:37.56]Oh, jeez.
[219:41.13]Oh, jeez.
[219:42.23]I think it is.
[219:42.69]No, it's not.
[219:47.34]Oh, jeez.
[219:49.06]I thought you fell out.
[219:50.86]It's alright.
[219:51.28]No, this is alright.
[219:52.00]We're okay.
[219:56.60]Oh, boy.
[219:57.36]I, like, this is, like, this is okay.
[220:00.78]Everything's gonna be fine.
[220:02.60]It actually ended up being, like, kind of a shortcut.
[220:04.76]Sort of.
[220:05.04]It's alright.
[220:09.74]Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.
[220:15.10]Ugh!
[220:15.56]It's gonna explode.
[220:19.21]All of a sudden, everyone's on us.
[220:20.47]We need a new car.
[220:22.71]I gotta cut this car off until we get to take this car.
[220:30.52]You... No!
[220:32.88]Why?
[220:33.38]Every time.
[220:34.28]Every time.
[220:34.62]Get in this guy's car.
[220:37.28]Get out.
[220:39.50]Get in.
[220:44.99]This thing is so slow.
[220:48.15]It's so slow.
[220:52.17]Where are we going?
[220:54.19]I gotta follow the road.
[220:55.43]I made it out.
[221:00.03]It's a yellow taxi.
[221:02.86]Everything's gonna be fine.
[221:03.66]And I have to pee again.
[221:08.58]So I'm gonna pee again.
[221:09.58]We're gonna complete this mission.
[221:13.10]When I drink coffee, I just pee.
[221:15.72]Like it is my job.
[221:20.27]If I get paid to pee, I'd make a lot of money.
[221:25.61]Anybody, like, have any jobs where it requires you, like, to piss in a toilet for a long period, a lot a day?
[221:31.42]Okay, well, I'm, like, sliding around.
[221:47.44]Mars doesn't have Uber.
[221:49.44]Yeah.
[221:50.48]This is back when taxis... There was no indication that taxis were ever going to be gone.
[221:58.78]This was made before Uber existed.
[222:04.27]Alright.
[222:06.45]We have only a couple of missions left.
[222:10.35]And I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[222:12.83]BRB.
[222:13.99]Time to pee.
[223:52.69]Alright, let's keep going.
[224:02.22]Shit.
[224:08.36]Oof.
[224:11.40]My frames are like dead.
[224:12.54]Alright.
[224:14.26]Fast P, yeah.
[224:15.86]We got a game to play, man.
[224:16.76]My frames are dying right now.
[224:19.86]I'm gonna have to reload the game.
[224:22.76]Yeah, I'm gonna reload it.
[224:23.76]My frames are, like, dead.
[224:30.97]Load game.
[224:33.45]No, the whole thing is, like, dead.
[224:34.89]I gotta, like, exit the game.
[224:35.99]Give me one second, guys.
[224:41.02]One sec.
[224:41.84]It'll come back.
[224:50.03]Open it up.
[224:55.53]Red faction!
[224:56.13]Here it comes.
[224:57.31]Memory leak?
[224:57.89]I think it was because of... When I do Alt-Enter, it doesn't, um... It, like, will not give me, like, the game back.
[225:07.98]It, like, kind of fucks with my whole game.
[225:11.95]But we should be good now.
[225:14.63]Seems like we're alright now.
[225:18.43]Kind of.
[225:18.75]Yeah, we're good.
[225:28.69]So we got this mission here.
[225:29.79]Let's clean it up.
[225:35.69]Finish it up.
[225:46.16]Speed Demon.
[225:51.08]So there's a lot of things I was thinking of playing tomorrow.
[225:53.80]I'm not sure...
[225:59.90]I got like at least a dozen games we could play.
[226:02.83]I'm gonna narrow it down and tomorrow we'll pick one.
[226:06.29]At some point.
[226:12.15]Hollow Knight?
[226:12.78]No.
[226:13.62]No Hollow Knight.
[226:16.64]Play them all at the same time.
[226:19.10]I would do something fucking stupid like that.
[226:21.48]But no.
[226:25.19]I wanted to play Gun.
[226:26.39]You guys remember Gun?
[226:29.67]That's one of the games on the list.
[226:30.73]No.
[226:31.05]No more Spore.
[226:31.69]Not playing Spore.
[226:33.73]Gun is awesome.
[226:34.46]Yeah.
[226:34.64]It might be fun.
[226:36.14]You got it.
[227:05.13]Did all these cars just spawn?
[227:07.33]Go to the comm center.
[227:10.22]Just snake around.
[227:11.22]There's also... Two Worlds is another one I was thinking of.
[227:20.30]Observer just came out.
[227:21.36]There's at least seven or eight games.
[227:37.25]Nice landing?
[227:37.75]Thanks, man.
[227:38.29]There it is.
[227:38.95]Good shortcut.
[227:39.89]This place is just under attack.
[227:42.36]Fuck.
[228:07.15]He's still... That guy's alive.
[228:09.77]Not anymore.
[228:14.06]Get in there.
[228:19.40]Why even get out of the car?
[228:28.09]I ran that guy's head over.
[228:39.33]Computer!
[228:40.79]Good thing I didn't try to blow this building up.
[228:42.49]I was going to shoot rockets at it.
[228:43.60]Whoa.
[228:44.84]Observer is from the Layers of Fear devs, right?
[228:47.62]Yep.
[228:53.65]What am I- What the hell am I doing?
[228:56.23]I've got a visual on the marauders now.
[228:58.11]Use the satellite view to target enemy units in range.
[229:01.07]When the reticule is on the target, pull the trigger to fire the guns.
[229:07.57]Wait, oh, I'm shooting my own thing.
[229:08.71]Okay.
[229:09.89]Keep that truck moving.
[229:11.49]I'm shooting the own- Oh, God.
[229:16.11]Damn it.
[229:19.19]What?
[229:25.12]What is this mission?
[229:31.24]Where am I going with this?
[229:39.06]I don't like this mission.
[229:43.07]This mission is like GTA 1.
[229:45.11]Oh, this sucks.
[229:50.53]I'm going to get a headache from this one.
[229:58.53]Anybody else?
[230:04.37]Ugh.
[230:05.95]Ugh.
[230:06.73]It's like five times across the whole mousepad, too.
[230:09.32]A little pain in the ass.
[230:16.78]Stop being bad.
[230:19.54]What would you have me do here?
[230:25.07]Like...
[230:30.83]That just flew across the fucking map and hit her.
[230:38.02]It's so zoomed in.
[230:39.88]There's a guy, like, all the way down here.
[230:42.08]Oh, my fucking god.
[230:45.90]But... Well, apparently we lost the truck.
[230:54.36]Okay.
[230:56.58]That...
[231:02.33]That was unbearable I'm going to increase my sensitivity by like a thousand percent right now That was that was I was truly an unbearable experience Where is it controls?
[231:26.52]Mouth sensitivity.
[231:28.02]Jack it way the fuck up to like as high as it can go.
[231:30.44]Alright, let's go.
[231:47.03]This is like actually hard to control too.
[231:50.17]This part might be the one that sends him over the edge.
[231:55.54]I want to... I can't just put me... What?
[232:03.47]You can't just... You can't just put me... Up here as a checkpoint to do this stupid fucking computer mission.
[232:14.18]Why do I have to do this again?
[232:15.24]Go up here and run over four people.
[232:17.66]You can't have a checkpoint after this happens.
[232:23.26]I'm at the coordinates.
[232:24.12]This site is hot.
[232:26.75]My sensitivity is so high.
[232:31.93]My sensitivity.
[232:33.83]Oh god.
[232:37.96]It's too high.
[232:43.58]I'm so gently moving the mouse.
[232:54.60]Don't accidentally shoot anything Okay, we're all clear now.
[233:04.16]I know what to do now Here we go All right now what here we go do it bring it up bring up my awful arcade game By the way
[233:23.49]Uh, that didn't do anything, by the way.
[233:24.63]That, like, didn't do anything.
[233:50.09]I think it may have actually made it worse, if that's even believable.
[233:55.37]I think it actually is worse.
[234:00.13]What the hell was it?
[234:00.96]What?
[234:09.10]Where is it?
[234:15.26]In front?
[234:15.60]Behind?
[234:15.82]I wish I could have a mini-map to see where they were coming from.
[234:34.13]I keep thinking that dumb firework at the end of that is gonna kill me.
[234:40.01]Get up here.
[234:51.22]One guy.
[234:51.72]I have to be getting to the end of this, please.
[235:03.84]What's that game?
[235:04.38]Like Spy Hunter?
[235:11.71]Ugh.
[235:12.93]Still people shooting from behind?
[235:19.19]Ugh.
[235:25.92]Oh, it's worse.
[235:26.92]Ugh.
[235:34.64]No!
[235:37.14]No!
[235:40.04]No, please.
[235:41.32]I don't want to do this again.
[235:42.20]Where'd it go?
[235:52.11]No!
[235:53.41]No!
[236:01.44]End the mission.
[236:02.24]Get me out of this mission.
[236:06.96]This is the puke mission.
[236:07.90]I don't know how I haven't thrown up yet.
[236:18.67]Let's let it be over now.
[236:20.10]Like... This is just dead air.
[236:36.05]Alright, that's it, right?
[236:37.17]That's the end.
[236:40.99]Where?
[236:46.71]Oh my god.
[236:59.68]Get back.
[237:01.40]Everybody's dead, right?
[237:05.05]Nobody coming from behind?
[237:10.15]What is that noise?
[237:11.79]Don't explode from one of these things blowing up next to you.
[237:20.74]Thank God.
[237:21.56]Phew.
[237:23.02]I spent two weeks making this level.
[237:26.22]Hahaha.
[237:33.93]Destroy the bridge?
[237:34.61]No way.
[237:35.47]Not on this mission.
[237:36.25]Alright, now we can put the sensitivity back.
[237:49.97]What was it on?
[237:51.19]Three.
[237:56.27]Stream's still going?
[237:56.99]Yeah.
[237:57.19]I mean, I'm pretty much near the end of the game.
[237:59.91]Just trying to get to the end.
[238:02.62]We've only got, seems like, one more mission, and then we, I think we do the last hurrah.
[238:09.60]I'm gonna save, just travel to here, and then go from there.
[238:17.02]Right here.
[238:17.53]Move it!
[238:33.96]I'm a trooper?
[238:34.48]Well, thank you.
[238:37.12]At 9.45, you said there's only one more mission.
[238:40.00]I know.
[238:40.36]Well, I... I really... I guess I just didn't... I guess I underestimated how long the end of the game is.
[238:47.14]I thought after you liberated everything, it was like, you did it.
[238:49.09]Congratulations.
[238:49.73]You've liberated Mars.
[238:51.33]Roll credits.
[238:52.45]Apparently not.
[239:03.68]It is 1143 PM.
[239:05.16]It is.
[239:17.18]Beep beep.
[239:22.69]Why do you need gas stations if your cars don't run out of gas?
[239:25.01]I don't know.
[239:25.55]That's a good question.
[239:28.09]Stay on the road.
[239:36.01]Anyone wants him to fire the garbage truck gun?
[239:38.53]You got it.
[239:38.89]I'm a man of the people.
[239:43.03]When somebody asks for like a request, you got it.
[239:45.19]Fire in the gun.
[239:57.67]Yay.
[239:58.93]Am I gonna play Armageddon next?
[240:00.59]No, I heard Armageddon's really not that great.
[240:05.40]From what everyone told me when I first started playing, they said, play this one.
[240:07.95]It's like the best one.
[240:08.87]All the other ones are like not good except for the first one.
[240:11.03]It's crap, is it?
[240:11.77]It's trash.
[240:12.19]It's horrible.
[240:13.35]That's the exact reason why you should play it.
[240:16.31]All right.
[240:16.97]Get the modified vehicle.
[240:35.56]It's right up here.
[240:36.16]Looks like we're just running.
[240:49.33]Missed a crane.
[240:53.92]Did you play Big Rigs because it was good?
[240:56.94]No, but, like... Alright.
[240:59.37]There's a difference... Here's the difference.
[241:00.79]There's a difference between, like, terribly hilariously funny bad, and just not good.
[241:08.05]There's been plenty of games that we've tried to play that didn't have, like, the charm of being an awful game.
[241:14.81]They were just not fun at all, and they weren't, like, funny, and they weren't interesting.
[241:20.36]Is that, like, one of those games?
[241:24.24]Like, is Red Faction Armageddon just, like, a bad game?
[241:27.63]Or is it, like, fun and funny and weird?
[241:35.13]Central Command.
[241:35.93]This way.
[241:39.19]Let's see if we can drive this to the force field.
[241:41.91]That thing's fast.
[241:46.93]Alright, this is like the place where you couldn't go before.
[241:50.91]Made it.
[241:51.15]Sure thing.
[241:53.09]Alright, well that didn't work.
[242:18.46]Back to my old tricks, you know what I mean?
[242:41.09]And... get it.
[242:41.41]Kaboom!
[242:43.33]Central Command is dead.
[242:45.85]Oh, now I'm inside of this.
[242:48.26]Oh, come on.
[242:55.66]Jesus.
[242:56.14]Get out of the car, you fucking idiot.
[242:59.08]I love how when that thing explodes, it makes a giant well in the ground.
[243:01.88]That's great.
[243:02.62]I lost my best fucking car.
[243:12.65]Make a fart noise, quick.
[243:15.73]Now we got these two... Let's get up there.
[243:26.63]Daisy is one of those bad fun games.
[243:30.41]Well... I've tried to play games with just... There was no charm.
[243:36.01]Look, a game can be the worst game ever made, but if it doesn't have, like, the charm...
[243:41.22]then it's not worth playing like please turn and there's one of those bad guys there's one of those crazy bots in here all right this is this is where we there's a lot there's so many things in the air holy goodness get in this that was a that was a double right there I'll take it
[244:17.24]I have no idea what the fuck is going on right now.
[244:27.53]Apparently I'm still being shot at.
[244:39.71]Okay.
[244:42.08]I guess we're going up there.
[244:43.12]Somebody just fell out of the tower.
[244:56.67]Where the fuck even is the ship?
[245:01.54]I gotta get out.
[245:02.14]Like, I have to.
[245:06.28]I'm not even in the right spot.
[245:13.35]Bring in, like, my team.
[245:22.64]Dude, this game's GPS.
[245:24.98]It could use a little work.
[245:26.50]Oh my lord.
[245:30.08]I'm just gonna go in.
[245:35.56]It's gonna wrap around.
[245:36.42]Up here.
[245:38.66]I don't think this... This is not it.
[245:44.88]Not it.
[245:45.24]Not quite.
[245:45.70]I'm in deep shit here now.
[246:00.75]Maybe if I can get around.
[246:01.67]I'll bend.
[246:30.15]Get exploded, please.
[246:33.03]Go!
[246:33.59]Alright, where's the other ones?
[246:40.00]I guess can I go straight?
[246:42.00]Wrap around, maybe?
[246:42.98]I need a car.
[246:45.59]I need a car bad.
[246:52.43]Any more flying vehicles?
[246:59.22]Yeah, I knew it.
[246:59.86]Of course there is.
[247:00.42]Playing a left.
[247:08.61]No cars, though.
[247:11.31]There's a vehicle right there.
[247:12.23]Alright, I shouldn't have even shot that many times.
[247:18.41]That was dumb.
[247:18.81]Is this the thing I had already?
[247:25.46]No, it's a new one.
[247:34.47]Oh, turn.
[247:37.11]Just blow this fucking thing to hell.
[247:42.94]Maybe not.
[247:43.36]I'm getting shot off from all sides over there.
[247:54.79]Right there.
[247:56.27]Take it out.
[248:00.97]Come on, die.
[248:06.59]51, 43, 41, go!
[248:07.31]How much does one have to really fucking shoot this thing for it to explode?
[248:24.62]Two more.
[248:30.26]You sloppy fucking thing.
[248:31.68]And I can't even aim higher than this.
[248:34.13]I gotta get up here.
[248:40.17]Come on, you sloppy fucking piece of shit.
[248:42.75]Get up there.
[248:43.35]Right in the middle.
[248:57.44]Last one.
[249:00.14]I'm being attacked by an airplane.
[249:07.98]That's it.
[249:09.63]Get out.
[249:10.93]Quickly.
[249:12.57]Quickly.
[249:13.03]Okay, well that's that.
[249:22.79]We got one more thing to do.
[249:25.09]We got one more mission.
[249:29.64]Guys, we only have one more mission.
[249:33.12]We're almost done.
[249:37.84]Aeos has been liberated.
[249:46.82]New mission unlocked.
[249:48.58]13 million missions.
[249:53.70]Looks like we're going into a whole nother zone.
[249:56.45]Holy shit.
[249:59.73]This is like an entire nother zone.
[250:05.86]That's okay.
[250:07.20]Impressions on this game?
[250:08.22]It's very fun.
[250:15.87]It is a very, very fun game.
[250:21.51]It's not a real zone.
[250:22.53]It's a fake zone.
[250:27.09]It's not that far away.
[250:28.11]I need a car, though.
[250:29.13]I feel like this is not going to be the right avenue to get over there.
[250:36.67]I might be able to do some weird fucking finicky around shit with this.
[250:40.38]Fly up there.
[250:40.92]It's going to take frequent breaks.
[250:48.12]Almost.
[250:51.55]I wonder if he'll be saying that after the last mission.
[250:53.51]Why?
[250:54.41]This is not one of those games that's really fun, but then the last mission makes the whole game a piece of shit.
[250:59.57]Don't tell me it's one of those.
[251:00.47]Is it?
[251:02.48]Is it one of those?
[251:09.33]I hope not.
[251:09.85]It's not.
[251:14.31]Okay.
[251:14.47]Well, that's encouraging at least.
[251:22.10]Maybe.
[251:22.64]No, no, no.
[251:23.46]Maybe.
[251:23.78]No.
[251:29.48]Hey, perp.
[251:31.23]Thanks for the bits.
[251:32.35]Any interest in trying out the multiplayer for Guerrilla sometime afterwards?
[251:35.83]It's crazy and explosive fun.
[251:37.41]Also, I think you could make Armageddon funny.
[251:38.95]It's got some... It's got some cool stuff buried in the shit.
[251:42.39]Okay.
[251:42.81]Well... I don't know.
[251:45.69]I don't really want to buy it, though.
[251:47.75]Like... God damn it.
[251:50.73]Buying Red Faction Armageddon is kind of like one of those... Isn't it like $60?
[251:54.39]Is it still like $50 or $60 or something?
[251:57.27]Or is it like $20?
[252:04.63]Stingy?
[252:05.13]No, I mean, I just... I don't want to, like... Unless I know I'm gonna play it.
[252:08.77]Cheap streamer.
[252:09.25]Just write it off on your taxes?
[252:10.91]Alright, so this is it.
[252:11.87]I win.
[252:12.19]Alright, this is it.
[252:14.17]I win.
[252:14.43]Time to win the game, guys.
[252:34.26]Where?
[252:34.38]There it is.
[252:34.96]All right, here we go.
[252:43.65]Good luck.
[252:44.07]Here comes the end of the game.
[253:03.92]I need to stock up on weapons and ammunition.
[253:08.90]Where's my ammo?
[253:13.98]Actually, I have full everything.
[253:15.31]Never mind.
[253:16.99]Never mind.
[253:17.37]Alright, Sam.
[253:25.17]I see one of those green things, but who cares.
[253:26.76]Alright.
[253:28.52]Alright.
[253:32.63]Did you see that flip first?
[253:33.75]I did like a little spin flip.
[253:34.91]That was pretty cool.
[253:40.09]Wait a minute.
[253:44.29]This is not going to be one of those top-down shoot-the-missile-at-the-stuff missions, is it?
[253:49.33]If it is, then I'm going to be very upset.
[253:56.68]Don't tell me it's one of those.
[254:06.73]I bumped into the computer, so the computer hits over, the mission's failed, the fucking human race doesn't win.
[254:12.91]The human race doesn't fucking win because you bumped into something.
[254:16.34]Give me a break.
[254:30.36]Oh, you bumped into that person.
[254:33.34]oh god damn it oh god damn it she's alive right yeah I just like it just bumped her she's more durable than the computer here's the forge good load it into that console
[254:51.45]I said this game was perfect.
[254:52.65]Yeah, I did say that.
[254:53.55]And then I... It was the honeymoon phase.
[254:59.03]Don't worry.
[255:02.42]I still think this game is very fun.
[255:05.76]I still stand by my statement that this is probably the most fun game I've had the pleasure of playing.
[255:15.17]No.
[255:17.05]Don't do it.
[255:19.39]Don't tell me.
[255:20.17]Don't.
[255:20.83]No.
[255:23.43]Oh, my God.
[255:24.37]Not this.
[255:25.19]Not this.
[255:25.69]Not the fire.
[255:26.21]You're going to give the last missions one of these.
[255:30.16]Oh, no.
[255:30.90]Don't.
[255:34.16]Oh, my God.
[255:35.86]Don't let them through.
[255:36.58]Where?
[255:37.00]Where are they coming from?
[255:37.74]Left or right?
[255:40.77]Where...
[255:45.48]It's just Missile Command.
[255:50.82]What is this, like a Macintosh from like 1991?
[255:52.56]You're not gonna make the last fucking game the last mission Missile Command, but you did.
[256:11.16]I'm severely disappointed.
[256:14.26]Is it wrong of me to be disappointed?
[256:15.48]They're just smashing into each other trying to get through.
[256:29.69]There's no rhyme or reason to this.
[256:34.03]There's no road here anymore.
[256:37.10]It's a bunch of rubble.
[256:39.49]Text that you cannot read goes here.
[256:41.05]Text that you cannot read goes here.
[256:45.39]Text that you can smell goes here.
[256:48.89]What is it saying?
[256:51.83]Did it never expect you to play this in a higher resolution to see that?
[256:59.13]Text that you can smell goes here.
[257:01.10]Text that you can read.
[257:01.96]Okay.
[257:05.24]Okay.
[257:13.00]Text that is too small to read.
[257:15.53]Alright, I need to beat this.
[257:17.31]I don't want to do this again.
[257:25.84]Sample text.
[257:29.98]It actually is sample text.
[257:39.36]They couldn't have done anything else.
[257:40.95]They couldn't have wrote, like, some alien language or something there.
[257:44.69]Or even, like, just, like, randomly coordinates.
[257:48.41]You're gonna give me sample text?
[258:04.12]I actually can't read it, though.
[258:08.91]Don't get through.
[258:11.07]Nobody can even get through though.
[258:12.81]That's like the weird part about this mission is even if they drive up here, there's so much shit in the way that it's almost impossible for them to go anywhere anyways.
[258:24.29]This is just becoming harder and harder for them to drive up here.
[258:31.96]It's just difficult to cross.
[258:33.72]That guy was kind of smart, but not smart enough.
[258:47.77]Oh, I hate this.
[258:53.31]What were they thinking?
[258:55.33]Okay, the game where you destroy buildings and it's really destructive environments.
[259:01.98]Spam missiles at the ground is what you got for the finale.
[259:08.40]And we're disconnecting.
[259:13.68]Are we disconnecting from the fucking console or did the game disconnect?
[259:17.46]Is the game crashing?
[259:20.39]Okay.
[259:23.17]I was about to say, that would be pretty ironic.
[259:27.37]It's not over.
[259:29.33]No, it is not.
[259:30.01]Get in the modified tank.
[259:44.22]More of this.
[259:45.75]This is the hard part.
[259:48.67]Get to the top of the mountain.
[259:55.61]Oh boy.
[259:57.55]Can I save this?
[259:59.19]Nope.
[260:00.06]We gotta do it in one shot, guys.
[260:03.74]Otherwise, we have to do that whole thing again.
[260:13.51]Whoa!
[260:14.73]Whoa, whoa!
[260:15.28]Okay, that's what it does.
[260:16.50]Left click and right click.
[260:32.27]Okay.
[260:41.81]Is this just the debris that was here?
[260:45.87]Am I just going down where like the fucking cars all were destroyed?
[260:50.11]Why couldn't I just stay inside of the missile launcher?
[261:02.59]Ow.
[261:15.85]Do you really want that I mean, I don't yeah, you know what you're right.
[261:18.93]I don't know if I want that for the final mission That doesn't scream final mission to me that okay.
[261:29.43]I just took a fucking hit that I shouldn't have done
[261:32.91]This is just all the cars I was destroying.
[261:34.91]They're just all in the way.
[261:35.73]I almost like, actually, you know, look at this!
[261:40.19]I kind of wish I was still stuck in that thing.
[261:55.88]I gotta slow down here, slow down.
[262:02.00]Okay, keep going.
[262:04.20]Get to the top of the mountain.
[262:09.91]Speed it up.
[262:13.57]I can't really speed it up.
[262:14.75]I can only go as fast as I can here.
[262:16.41]I can't... The whole screen is smoked.
[262:29.18]Just go this way.
[262:31.08]Just keep going.
[262:31.68]Oh my god.
[262:37.45]I'm gonna lose this mission.
[262:38.77]Because I think I'm rolling off the cliff.
[262:43.25]I don't even know what the fuck is happening right now.
[262:45.51]This is dumb.
[262:46.83]This is the dumbest thing ever.
[262:50.31]All you did is just you threw up.
[262:51.97]You spawned too many things.
[262:55.35]And I'm gonna explode and move to do the whole thing again.
[263:08.70]Because there are things... They can't destroy it if I don't let them.
[263:17.90]They're going to aim at me.
[263:20.70]As long as they aim at me, it's fine.
[263:23.98]That thing can just stay there in the middle of the road.
[263:25.97]Who cares?
[263:34.74]Get to the fucking top of the goddamn mountain.
[263:42.13]That ain't gonna happen.
[263:59.20]Don't ever say never.
[264:02.20]Don't never ever say ever.
[264:11.75]Think we need a fucking tank to get up there?
[264:14.02]Don't ever say never.
[264:28.04]Good job!
[264:43.85]Don't ever say never!
[264:46.83]Oh shit!
[264:52.02]Don't!
[265:01.08]What a stupid fucking mission.
[265:14.79]How are you supposed to do this?
[265:16.95]There's probably like 500 tanks.
[265:19.98]If only I had a tank that didn't just get destroyed.
[265:22.18]Am I even going the right fucking way?
[265:25.08]No, I'm not.
[265:27.96]Like, where's the... Where's my fucking... What's going on here?
[265:36.02]Just lower the difficulty?
[265:37.08]Well, everyone will just make fun of me.
[265:40.08]This is the wrong way.
[265:42.50]Why wouldn't it... This is not the wrong way.
[265:47.04]Just drive?
[265:47.96]Well, you saw what happened when I... If I touch anything and it explodes, it takes off like 20% of my health.
[265:56.45]You want me to just drive?
[265:58.47]Alright, I'll just try to drive.
[265:59.43]Like, I took so many hits.
[266:08.25]Just hold W. I guess that's what I'm going to do.
[266:14.20]There's no rhyme or reason to any of this shit.
[266:20.84]Look at how much damage I just took.
[266:23.22]I can't even... I'm not even going to shoot the gun.
[266:32.62]You know, if I shoot, it'll blow up next to me.
[266:35.84]Because there's so many things on the screen.
[266:40.93]No, no, no, no.
[266:41.63]That's not gonna work.
[266:42.31]This ain't gonna work.
[266:43.30]I'm taking so much damage.
[266:50.42]Can't even drive over this.
[267:05.07]Pretend it's a rail shooter.
[267:06.53]Like...
[267:09.06]Can't pretend it's a real shooter.
[267:10.40]There's too many enemies They just they spawned too many people look at do you see there were like 12 people sitting outside the car?
[267:21.49]What the hell would you do this for?
[267:32.63]Out of the way, where's my air support I?
[267:46.43]It's like an RTS.
[267:47.33]I feel like I'm one unit in an RTS right now.
[268:00.09]How am I not taking any damage?
[268:01.17]This is going to blow up on me.
[268:03.43]Watch.
[268:04.23]Ow, ow, ow.
[268:13.37]This... Get me out of this.
[268:18.75]Where is it?
[268:19.93]Where do I need to go?
[268:21.79]Go to the top of the mountain.
[268:22.97]And now where, friend?
[268:24.53]Now where, friendo? ...
[268:43.28]Where is this?
[268:43.92]What the fuck, man?
[268:57.31]Well, that was an explo- These guys are on my team, right?

[269:13.36]Come on, cheese it.
[269:15.24]Cheese this shit.
[269:20.30]What?
[269:21.66]Oh no, that's the general.
[269:23.82]Oh, fucking ball of cheese, man.
[269:25.26]Here we go.
[269:25.84]Destroy the doors and kill General Ruff.
[269:34.67]Got him.
[269:38.71]Got him.
[269:41.76]That was easy.
[269:42.72]Blow the doors off.
[269:44.62]And kill General Sam.
[269:50.66]Let's do it.
[269:54.42]That's destroyed, right?
[269:58.30]What am I doing?
[269:58.70]What happened?
[270:01.15]Destroy the doors blocking the missile launch.
[270:07.63]What?
[270:07.95]Where are the doors?
[270:09.25]What doors?
[270:09.87]What?
[270:10.71]What's happening?
[270:22.15]What?
[270:24.37]Destroy more?
[270:25.11]Okay.
[270:32.35]I was about to be so sad.
[270:33.44]I did it.
[270:38.54]Cover your ears.
[270:43.04]Game over.
[270:45.48]I cheesed it.
[270:46.68]I just flew over with my jetpack.
[270:50.46]Ending cutscene.
[270:51.42]Good game.
[270:55.09]This whole time we were just gonna blow up the moon.
[271:00.33]Everyone cover your ears.
[271:03.39]Everyone's doing not like this.
[271:05.82]Cover your ears, guys.
[271:10.28]How are you supposed to beat that mission with a tank?
[271:17.59]Especially on a harder difficulty.
[271:19.55]Find and secure the Nanoforge.
[271:21.51]Make best efforts to spare infrastructure, mines, and industrial zones.
[271:30.52]Terminate all Red Faction insurgents.
[271:32.78]What?
[271:33.28]What about the civilian service?
[271:34.60]Hold on, they... They're expendable.
[271:37.50]Wait, we did all that just to get, like, nuked?
[271:42.49]Admiral, we have a visual.
[271:45.64]Oh, we shot them with a nuke.
[271:47.26]Oh, no!
[271:47.58]Admiral, look out the window!
[271:50.58]Oh, shit!
[271:50.90]No, I was hoping it would just get him.
[272:32.61]There were a lot of people on that ship that didn't, like, really deserve to die.
[272:35.29]Huh.
[272:41.71]Well, good job, I guess.
[272:43.23]That's right, it's over.
[272:59.05]They'll be back.
[272:59.61]Not for, like, a few years until we decide to make the next game.
[273:08.10]Oh, what a perfect place to drop one of those singularities.
[273:13.03]They'll be back.
[273:13.63]Well, they died, so they won't.
[273:14.55]The logo.
[273:14.83]And I did it with my bare hands.
[273:41.30]It just takes some time.
[273:45.12]What if it started playing like fucking Tony Hawk music?
[273:49.70]Everything, everything's gonna be alright.
[273:55.43]Hey, nice job, Todd Marshall.

[274:09.02]Difficulty levels for EDF.
[274:10.28]Oh, yeah.
[274:15.76]They got places to be, boys and girls!
[274:17.88]All right, well, let's turn on the cheats.
[274:31.54]Oh, nothing even fucking matters anymore.
[274:33.11]I can just take somebody's head off.

[275:30.44]Up down here.
[275:34.54]Duh.
[275:37.50]That was weird.
[275:41.76]Game... What do I do here?
[275:46.61]In the menu in the game.
[275:47.85]Oh, okay.

[276:25.85]Hold on, I gotta... I really gotta... It's just human golf.
[276:38.75]That's all this turns into.
[276:41.35]They go fucking fast!
[276:43.50]Remember this joke?
[276:46.41]Hello!
[276:47.81]See you at the moon, motherfucker!
[276:51.75]Now we start playing the real game.
[276:53.29]Holy shit.
[277:02.09]That's so stupid.
[277:05.01]Get out of here.
[277:06.17]It's just croquet.
[277:12.00]Don't you fucking beep at me.
[277:24.34]This is the dumbest fucking thing ever.
[277:30.42]Oh my god.
[277:31.04]I'm so glad I did not turn this on in the actual game.
[277:35.84]Fuck the bridges, you know what I'm saying?
[277:37.26]We gotta get somebody else in the building.
[277:45.44]Hole in one.
[277:45.94]Alright, now what?
[277:57.26]Destroy that bridge, you got it.
[278:05.83]Hammer punch.
[278:10.47]Got it!
[278:14.35]Max technology.
[278:23.95]He's not happy upgrades are free.
[278:26.51]Let's go get an upgrade I'm having too much fun.
[278:32.50]Just knocking cars around like fucking golf balls Now let's go get out all the upgrades Ah shit Hey
[278:52.14]It's just a truck.
[278:53.50]Okay, let's just fast travel to here and get every single upgrade.
[278:57.80]I can't.
[278:58.40]I guess I can't even do that.
[279:01.68]Interesting.
[279:08.58]Come on!
[279:09.20]Why does everything have to be a fucking mountain?
[279:13.83]It's like everything has to be a mountain in this game.
[279:16.47]You have to have one tiny little entrance to every one of these fucking safe houses.
[279:20.89]Give me a break, red faction.
[279:22.51]You're not impressed.
[279:30.08]Okay, let's get every upgrade.
[279:35.04]I don't think everything's free.
[279:40.58]Not everything's free.
[279:45.18]You don't have the free upgrades treat.
[279:46.78]Ah, that's too bad.
[279:49.12]Oh, well.
[279:53.59]I didn't unlock that cheat, apparently.
[279:56.69]Reconstructor.
[279:57.47]What the hell is this?
[279:58.11]Come here.
[280:18.47]Oh, what?
[280:21.97]I want to throw him in the air.
[280:28.51]Rocket jump.
[280:33.03]Reconstructor is the campaign, apparently.
[280:37.18]Alright, well.
[280:39.22]That was fun.
[280:41.56]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[280:50.78]Come here.
[280:52.52]Holy shit.
[280:55.04]That does go a little bit farther.
[281:00.26]Go to your map.
[281:02.51]Alright, what about my map?
[281:05.11]What's going on with my map?
[281:06.23]What is this?
[281:09.29]It's always the hammer.
[281:11.73]Yeah, well, we completed Red Faction Guerrilla.
[281:14.17]Very fun game.
[281:17.31]Highly recommend.
[281:19.74]Highly recommend that you check it out if you liked the stream.
[281:30.77]We're good.
[281:33.51]And as always, thanks for watching.
[281:34.95]See you guys tomorrow.
[281:36.67]There is a couple of options tomorrow.
[281:39.84]We'll see.
[281:41.98]Starting at 7 o'clock as always.
[281:44.82]Thank you again.
[281:47.24]I give it a 9 out of 10.
[281:49.18]Very, very good game.
[281:50.00]And I gotta get these cranes.
[281:52.52]Final thing.
[281:53.32]Cranes.
[281:58.91]Got crane.
[282:00.35]One more crane to get.
[282:01.55]Otherwise, like, I can't turn this dream off.
[282:10.48]Got him.
[282:12.10]Nope.
[282:14.36]Okay, Scream can now successfully get turned off.
[282:17.32]I have to hit one more person in the head, though.
[282:19.06]Like, somebody else has to die.
[282:26.58]Ooh!
[282:29.61]Perfect.
[282:30.85]Alright, well that person died.
[282:38.67]We did it.
[282:43.26]Why can't I destroy this?
[282:44.24]What?
[282:45.11]That's bullshit.
[282:45.75]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[282:49.51]I will see you all on the flip side.
[282:54.19]Let's do one more salute here.
[282:55.71]Here we go.
[283:00.36]I'm in my own orbit.
[283:03.70]And that's gonna be it.
[283:06.08]So, goodnight, goodbye, thank you for joining us.
[283:10.20]Uh, make sure I didn't miss any bits or anything.
[283:12.46]Uh, Phil White, thanks for the bits, and here I thought the last mission would be of a duel between you and your father's killer.
[283:17.64]No, it's just spawn 5,000 enemies and run them over with tanks.
[283:23.37]Armageddon is free on Xbox this month.
[283:25.39]That's interesting, thanks Tub Tucker.
[283:30.89]And, uh, yeah.
[283:32.97]Goodbye, goodnight.
[283:35.44]I'll probably put a straw poll in the chat tomorrow afternoon to see what you guys would want to see.
[283:40.82]But we continue tomorrow.
[283:42.64]Have a good one.
