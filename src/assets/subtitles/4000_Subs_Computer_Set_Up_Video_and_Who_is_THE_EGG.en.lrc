[00:01.52]Oh, hello, cats.
[00:03.34]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:04.24]It's Gerber here for the 4,000 subscriber video.
[00:07.79]This is my dog, Simon.
[00:09.67]He's a dachshund.
[00:10.51]He's like 17 years old.
[00:12.47]He's really... Oh, yes, hello.
[00:14.09]Hello.
[00:15.21]He can go down.
[00:16.19]But thank you guys so much.
[00:17.31]I got a couple of things in this video you guys are going to like.
[00:19.75]I've got a setup video, and I have a crazy kind of cooking show.
[00:25.90]But hopefully you guys enjoy it.
[00:27.10]I really do appreciate the 4,000.
[00:28.78]Let's keep rolling, everybody.
[00:33.20]Alright, so this is my desk.
[00:35.50]I'll give you like a nice wide shot of the desk.
[00:38.31]So there's the desk, there's the monitor, there's my chair.
[00:40.95]The desk is kind of messy, so I apologize.
[00:43.59]I didn't really have time to clean it up before I made this video.
[00:47.87]But anyways, the computer is under the desk.
[00:51.39]It's lit, it's all lit up blue and stuff, nice and cool.
[00:55.12]So that is the computer.
[00:56.84]The specs on this thing, it is a custom-built Digital Storm PC.
[01:01.59]Highly recommend Digital Storm.
[01:03.01]If you guys don't know what Digital Storm is, go find out.
[01:05.67]They're awesome.
[01:07.03]So it is an Intel i7-950, and it's overclocked to 3.6 GHz.
[01:13.49]It has 6 GB of RAM at 1600 MHz.
[01:17.78]It has a NVIDIA GTX 470, the super-clocked EVGA edition.
[01:25.24]Shibby will like that.
[01:27.25]And it also has a 1TB, I believe, 1TB 32MB cache hard drive.
[01:34.56]I think it's a Western Digital, I think.
[01:37.40]Here's the monitor.
[01:39.02]It is a 27-inch monitor made by HP, the HP 2710M.
[01:46.59]It's a very, very nice monitor, nice and glossy, nice finish.
[01:49.57]I really enjoy it.
[01:51.19]So that's kind of my computer setup.
[01:53.03]Oh, I also, here's my external hard drive right there.
[01:56.81]I have it plugged in with eSATA.
[01:59.05]I don't have it plugged in with USB because eSATA is faster and more efficient.
[02:04.85]And yeah, that's pretty much my computer setup.
[02:07.05]Hope you guys enjoy that.
[02:08.43]And now let's make some breakfast.
[02:11.43]All right, so we're here in the kitchen.
[02:12.63]I'm going to cook you guys an American classic.
[02:15.63]This is the two eggs, two pieces of bacon.
[02:20.15]They say, Germa, how do you stay so healthy?
[02:22.15]How do you stay so physically fit?
[02:23.73]What can I do to get healthy?
[02:25.83]Besides exercise and besides obviously keeping a good diet, you want a good breakfast.
[02:29.76]Now, let's start off by talking about the bacon.
[02:31.90]Bacon, you want premium cut.
[02:33.16]You don't want any of the gross, bad stuff.
[02:34.94]You want the good stuff.
[02:36.28]Two eggs, two pieces of toast, and we're going to start.
[02:41.88]There's only one egg in here.
[02:43.32]All right.
[02:43.54]Let's just go to some of them.
[02:49.59]I just want an egg.
[02:52.75]Oh, it's the egg.
[02:55.27]Oh, all right.
[02:56.35]Come on in, Rubble.
[02:57.03]Let's do this.
[03:00.53]This is the egg, for those of you that don't know.
[03:02.27]This is the egg.
[03:03.29]He's a really good friend of mine.
[03:04.48]He's been here for a long time.
[03:06.58]He had a crazy accident at some point in his life.
[03:08.98]I don't know when it was, but he turned into this.
[03:12.42]I mean, I don't know why I'm introducing you.
[03:15.26]You could potentially do this yourself, but...
[03:23.91]I'm trying to do a healthy American breakfast.
[03:30.99]I kind of only wanted to be honest.
[03:32.69]I wanted just a few eggs.
[03:34.61]I only wanted two eggs.
[03:35.93]You can never have too many eggs.
[03:42.19]You gotta tell me, you're the egg expert, so you gotta tell me if this is true.
[03:45.23]Is it true that the egg yolk is like the unhealthy part?
[03:48.17]Don't you really want to cook like the egg whites and... In the Mediterranean, we only cook hybrid goat and chicken egg.
[03:58.66]Okay.
[04:00.82]So what does that have to do with anything?
[04:11.24]This is not how you cook eggs.
[04:13.50]I don't know where you figured this was a good idea.
[04:16.28]Whoever told you this was a good idea was completely wrong.
[04:20.11]Everybody thinks this is funny.
[04:21.85]What are you doing?
[04:23.71]So, I mean, I at least want to add a little bit of bacon because bacon is... Not!
[04:30.03]Only egg!
[04:32.84]Alright, the egg has officially left us.
[04:36.00]I don't know where he went.
[04:37.22]He just took off.
[04:38.28]He like stormed out of the kitchen.
[04:40.26]I don't understand, but I'm going to try and fix this breakfast because this is an atrocity.
[04:45.20]Thank you, egg.
[04:46.70]Thanks for bringing me extra eggs.
[04:48.36]I appreciate it, but you obviously have a few problems in your life you need to deal with, and that's something that you can figure out on your own.
[04:57.60]Okay, so it has been a painfully long time since the egg has left, and to be completely honest, I'm getting kind of concerned, so...
[05:08.99]Did you hear that?
[05:09.47]Is that the shower?
[05:11.49]That is the shower.
[05:12.23]Come on.
[05:12.99]Egg?
[05:14.29]Egg?
[05:15.17]Shh.
[05:18.91]I knew this was going to happen, dude.
[05:20.51]Watch out.
[05:20.82]Watch out.
[05:21.10]Get out of the way.
[05:21.68]Watch out.
[05:33.86]You all right, Egg?
[05:40.58]It's time for you to go home, okay?
[05:42.84]You gotta go home.
[05:44.96]See you later, egg.
[05:45.92]When you're out of the shower, get out of here, okay?
[05:47.56]Leave the house.
[05:50.35]Weirdo.
[05:52.09]So thank you everybody for 4,000 subscribers.
[05:54.69]You guys are awesome.
