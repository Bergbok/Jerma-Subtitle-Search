[00:08.46]Is it really appropriate that we're both naked men?
[00:16.79]Yes, it is.
[00:17.57]It is appropriate.
[00:20.19]Nah, you ain't taking that box.
[00:21.91]Put it back.
[00:22.35]Come here.
[00:26.95]Can I bash you in the face with this?
[00:35.85]I just... Oh, shit.
[00:39.21]Why does... Alright, explain what world does a box do more, like, knockback and damage than a fucking showerhead?
[00:45.15]Dude, I'm gonna kill you!
[00:54.39]No!
[00:54.92]Oh!

[01:29.33]Hold on, don't worry!
[01:31.71]I brought you some, like, potato chips!

[03:40.19]Is that what you have?
[03:47.92]Why can't we stop this?
[03:51.00]No, if I go die, we're gonna have to do this all over again.
[03:53.32]It's all up to me.
[03:54.46]It's all up to you.
[03:55.62]Just go get a drink.
[03:57.22]And it's all up to me, he says.
[03:58.93]It's all up to me, and then he dies.
[04:01.03]I didn't even get out the door.
[04:04.49]You didn't even get out the fucking door.
[04:07.19]Please stop killing each other.
[04:08.63]No, no, I... When you give people this type of freedom with this amount of items, there's no way you're gonna get out the front door.
[04:20.23]Just grab a bunch of stuff.
[04:22.15]Oh, all the foods in here, like orange juice and shit.
[04:24.88]Oh, you want to have a little breakfast party?
[04:27.48]Mustard.

[05:08.57]Get me out of this room!
[05:11.09]I don't think we can keep this person alive.
[05:12.65]You don't think we can?
[05:13.13]I won't bet money on it.
[05:14.23]Okay, well... Because we're not gonna... We're gonna get distracted by something.
[05:18.07]Well, just try.
[05:19.07]I want the extra points.

[05:35.82]Uh, maybe not.
[05:38.74]Maybe not.
[05:44.53]I'll just wait over here.
[05:45.31]Whoa, whoa, whoa, there's more people in here!
[05:47.31]They're having, like, a reunion!
[05:48.73]They're, like, hugging each other and stuff, and there's zombies everywhere!
[05:53.31]Dude, you don't hug it out during a zombie apocalypse in a room full of 30 zombies.
[05:59.40]Let's go.
[06:00.74]We don't have time.
[06:02.98]Let's go, Gordon.
[06:04.62]Come on, Gordon.
[06:05.94]Come on, Gordy.
[06:08.34]What the hell are they doing?
[06:10.30]Oh, shit.
[06:11.36]What?
[06:11.58]That's not what I thought I was equipping.
[06:13.76]What do you mean?
[06:15.61]Aren't yous so pretty?
[06:23.13]It looked like, I don't know, just like plaid shirts.
[06:26.01]Well, can you stop, like, trying on, like, women's clothing and come, like, fight?
[06:29.51]These guys are, people are dying.
[06:30.88]No, I gotta, I gotta take care of it.
[06:32.74]Oh my god.
[06:35.68]We got two people dying.
[06:38.04]I'm fighting off a zombie apocalypse and you're trying on women's clothing.
[06:41.44]I have the only loaded gun.
[06:43.28]Yeah, you're the only person with a gun.
[06:47.11]Thanks for the help.
[06:50.05]Oh shit.
[06:51.05]Don't worry, I got you.
[06:57.47]Well, Lissandra's almost dead.
[06:58.79]Can we just go?
[07:00.32]I would really appreciate the help if you would get over here.
[07:04.56]What?
[07:05.24]I don't have any weapons left.
[07:06.32]And Lissandra takes a wild swing at my face and kills me.
[07:09.23]Dude, what the hell was the point of that?
[07:10.61]Will you quit trying on shoes and get over here?
