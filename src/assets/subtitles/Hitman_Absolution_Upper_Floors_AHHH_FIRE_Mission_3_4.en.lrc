[00:08.86]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.42]Welcome back to more Hitman Absolution.
[00:13.33]This is going to be the second part of the Terminus mission.
[00:16.59]The Upper Floors.
[00:18.29]So let's go.
[00:19.33]Welcome back.
[00:21.22]Hmm.
[00:26.16]Yeah, well, I pretty much just killed, like, everybody downstairs.
[00:29.58]There was a lot of people that didn't die.
[00:34.11]What?
[00:35.69]Come on!
[00:36.33]I didn't even do anything.
[00:37.91]I wanted to hear what they were saying.
[00:39.71]You know what, buddy?
[00:40.79]I'm gonna restart this mission, but just because you are a jerk, I'm gonna blow your faces off!
[00:46.60]All three years!
[00:48.26]Yeah!
[00:48.94]Yeah!
[00:50.56]Alright, so I guess how it works is if you are disguised as a group of people, they will see through your disguise.
[00:58.21]That group will see through your disguise more often than not.
[01:00.65]So, you can't just walk into groups of people that I'm disguised as.
[01:04.03]I know.
[01:07.77]Too bad.
[01:08.24]That's too bad.
[01:11.84]I don't know where to go.
[01:14.48]There's people everywhere here, man.
[01:16.86]Where am I supposed to go?
[01:20.33]Let's follow this lady.
[01:21.21]Maybe not, because she's in, like, somebody's room.
[01:26.58]Point of interest.
[01:28.24]Over here.
[01:31.56]Alright.
[01:34.34]A lot of paintings on the wall.
[01:36.16]I thought there was blood all over the ground here.
[01:38.64]It's flowers.
[01:40.38]I thought somebody got, like, riddled with bullets in this hallway for a second.
[01:45.92]Indicates a nearby fire escape!
[01:48.36]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:49.80]There's nobody even here.
[01:51.30]What?
[01:51.92]Who am I hiding from?
[01:53.68]Was I not supposed to come in this room?
[01:55.92]I probably wasn't, like, allowed in here.
[01:57.22]Because, I mean, it did say, do not disturb, so... This lady's like, uh, sir, what the hell are you doing over there?
[02:04.73]Nothing, I'm just standing here.
[02:08.43]Hi.
[02:08.79]Alright, let me... Will you get out of the way, bitch?
[02:11.95]I didn't mean to call you bitch, but you're just getting on my nerves.
[02:14.02]Alright.
[02:15.46]What is this?
[02:17.85]The musician won't leave his room without a reason, so this guy apparently... Is anybody even in here?
[02:23.57]Oh, he's right there.
[02:25.70]Is he just in there rocking out, playing the guitar?
[02:29.00]Well, sorry, dude.
[02:30.52]I'm ruining your stuff.
[02:35.72]Can I go out?
[02:36.10]I can't go out this window.
[02:37.24]Can I just, like, crouch back here?
[02:39.02]No, no, get in this thing!
[02:40.08]Get in here!
[02:40.70]Quick!
[02:42.32]Get in!
[02:43.61]Oh, alright.
[02:44.27]Is he coming out?
[02:46.45]Yeah, he is.
[02:49.09]Oh, your room is crazy, man.
[02:50.93]I can't wait to go in there and break those lights.
[02:52.98]Uh, you're going to have to turn around.
[03:00.66]If I come out of here, he's going to see me.
[03:04.24]Yeah, yeah, make your way to that speaker.
[03:06.19]Go fix it.
[03:06.71]There's a problem there.
[03:08.23]You're going to have to deal with it.
[03:13.31]Oh, boy.
[03:14.97]Oh, boy.
[03:15.39]Oh, boy.
[03:15.77]Oh, boy.
[03:16.07]He doesn't know I was here.
[03:16.91]Oh, boy.
[03:19.72]He's still fixing his stuff.
[03:20.79]What am I doing here?
[03:22.77]What the hell am I supposed to do in here?
[03:23.87]There's a bottle.
[03:24.71]Uh, sure.
[03:27.99]This room is gonna make me, like, start to hallucinate.
[03:31.01]Oh, he's back.
[03:34.18]He's back!
[03:34.80]He's back!
[03:36.98]What am I doing here?
[03:37.88]I, like, I broke in this guy's room for, like, no reason.
[03:41.22]Wait a minute.
[03:43.36]Um... I think I'm gonna have to bottle this guy in the face.
[03:47.38]That's really my only solution.
[03:49.40]Because... I don't know what to do, but I'm gonna hide his body.
[03:52.72]Don't worry.
[03:55.68]That didn't even work!
[03:57.94]Come here!
[04:00.28]Alright.
[04:00.78]We're good.
[04:01.30]We're good.
[04:03.58]Okay.
[04:04.04]I'm good.
[04:05.38]Nobody heard that.
[04:06.42]Nobody saw that.
[04:08.14]Now I can... Can I take his disguise?
[04:09.56]I cannot.
[04:13.02]Can I play his keyboard?
[04:14.94]Let's hope so.
[04:17.20]Dump his body in here.
[04:20.54]I can't believe the bottle didn't hurt him.
[04:23.75]I threw a bottle at this guy's face and it didn't do anything.
[04:26.37]I should probably put the shotgun away.
[04:28.69]That would be a bad idea.
[04:29.79]Pizza?
[04:30.35]I'll take a slice.
[04:34.15]So what was the purpose of this room?
[04:38.47]This son of a bitch had nothing in here for me to do.
[04:42.10]There's got to be something in here.
[04:43.30]Why would I be coming in here?
[04:46.00]Oh, wait a minute.
[04:49.50]Whoa.
[04:51.76]This is the same... Can I go with the window?
[04:57.19]Is there any... Oh, there's a window.
[05:00.09]Fire extinguisher.
[05:01.43]I don't think I want that.
[05:02.97]This guy's got food literally everywhere.
[05:05.11]What a freak.
[05:05.75]I don't know.
[05:10.19]Let's go.
[05:12.88]So maybe I had to come through there.
[05:14.81]Ooh, can I go?
[05:16.79]I can go up here, can't I?
[05:20.11]That's where the guy is.
[05:20.81]That's where the target is.
[05:24.01]Climb.
[05:25.98]There's not some guy just standing right here, is there?
[05:30.42]Oh lord.
[05:32.60]Progress is only saved.
[05:33.66]Oh yeah, definitely activate the checkpoint.
[05:36.91]Minus 135.
[05:37.23]God damn it.
[05:41.91]Well, what's... Whoa!
[05:43.28]Whoa!
[05:45.26]See ya!
[05:47.36]Oh my!
[05:48.22]Oh my!
[05:49.62]That's a long... Oh, he just broke his back!
[05:53.44]Wow!
[05:55.26]Well, why do I always do that to people?
[05:59.51]I always do that to people!
[06:02.11]I probably could've just let that guy, like, smoke his cigarette or whatever he was doing, and he could leave.
[06:05.47]You think this guy's gonna be suspicious that his, like, best friend just is not here anymore?
[06:11.57]Maybe I can pull this guy out, too.
[06:12.75]Do I have anything?
[06:15.21]No, I don't.
[06:15.69]Can I make any noise?
[06:17.27]No, I don't think so.
[06:21.33]Only one guy in here.
[06:24.93]Will you get out of the way?
[06:25.77]This guy's going to see me walk by.
[06:26.86]Go.
[06:30.38]Okay.
[06:32.30]I need a new disguise, man.
[06:34.44]I can't just be walking around.
[06:36.80]Maybe these guys will have a conversation.
[06:40.83]Maybe not.
[06:42.07]There's really no other way unless I go down.
[06:44.25]I don't really want to go down.
[06:48.11]This is going to take a little bit of thought.
[06:49.90]Hold on.
[06:55.08]I can go in here, but these guys are in there.
[06:59.18]Come to the window.
[07:00.68]Come over to the window and take a look.
[07:03.23]You're going to meet the same fate as your friend.
[07:08.79]No, this guy's still just staring at me.
[07:11.94]Damn it!
[07:14.96]Wait, is that the target right there?
[07:19.42]I guess I can drop down.
[07:22.32]But then again, I want to be up on this top floor, don't I?
[07:28.92]We'll see.
[07:31.24]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[07:33.56]I might be able to get behind this guy right now.
[07:36.66]No, there's another guard in here.
[07:37.86]Damn it!
[07:40.29]Let's go down.
[07:43.45]Looks like I can get in this way.
[07:47.13]Hop down again, maybe?
[07:50.44]No?
[07:51.16]That's it?
[07:52.66]I can either go up... I have to go in this door.
[07:57.80]Or this window.
[08:00.66]Damn it, man.
[08:03.11]Now that these guys are all the way in the back, I'm gonna try and distract them.
[08:05.63]I got an idea.
[08:07.51]I got an idea.
[08:10.17]At least, oh, you know what, I can just try and do some crazy stuff right now, because I do have that checkpoint right there.
[08:15.33]So.
[08:16.59]Let's just go in.
[08:17.99]When this guy turns around again, I'm going in this window.
[08:22.78]Turn around, come on.
[08:25.26]Turn around.
[08:25.82]I'm gonna ask you nicely one more time, and then I'm pulling out the gun.
[08:32.92]And I'm gonna shoot you in your face.
[08:36.85]Turn around.
[08:37.99]Turn around!
[08:39.38]Turn around.
[08:39.74]There we go.
[08:40.26]Turn around.
[08:40.68]That's what I like to see.
[08:44.36]Okay.
[08:45.82]I have reached the eighth floor.
[08:49.89]My word.
[08:51.11]This is going to take a lot of good stealth.
[08:57.57]Oh, the piano.
[08:58.15]I can knock the piano thing down?
[09:01.03]Oh, boy.
[09:02.45]Oh, boy.
[09:03.25]Oh, boy.
[09:03.61]Oh, boy.
[09:04.89]Oh, boy.
[09:06.07]Oh, boy.
[09:06.39]Oh, boy.
[09:06.75]Oh, boy.
[09:08.93]No, no, no, no, no, don't come over here.
[09:10.97]Do not come over here.
[09:13.92]This is the most nerve-wracking thing ever.
[09:18.16]So if I knock down that piano pin, is there a place for me to hide?
[09:21.35]Can I hide in the fireplace?
[09:25.23]Hmm.
[09:26.89]I know what I'm going to do.
[09:28.45]I'm going to grab the bottle.
[09:29.71]I'm going to throw the bottle over there.
[09:30.85]And I'm going to try and make my way silently out the left side.
[09:35.19]There's only one guy there.
[09:36.93]We go bottle.
[09:39.05]And... Throw it over there and... Wait for them to freak out.
[09:46.60]Yeah.
[09:48.10]Yeah.
[09:48.58]Go!
[09:49.58]Whoa!
[09:50.02]Right there!
[09:50.40]There's a guy right there!
[09:53.10]Knock this down!
[09:54.20]Screw this.
[09:56.04]Oh no, now that's all of them.
[09:57.70]All of them, all of them, all of them, all of them.
[10:01.20]Am I actually gonna get away with this?
[10:02.46]How the hell did I not get spotted right there?
[10:04.32]Are you kidding me?
[10:04.98]I need that bottle.
[10:10.00]Oh, I need to just go in the room behind me.
[10:11.98]But I can't.
[10:12.82]I'm gonna alert this whole entire upper floor.
[10:18.00]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[10:24.59]Come here.
[10:25.17]Come here, you!
[10:26.51]Come here, you son of a bitch!
[10:28.25]Quiet!
[10:29.13]Don't!
[10:29.61]Just be quiet!
[10:30.27]Shut up!
[10:31.41]Just... Just... Oh no!
[10:32.84]Where do I go?
[10:34.42]Where do I go?
[10:35.04]Is there anybody in this hall?
[10:36.88]Come on!
[10:37.20]Come this way!
[10:37.64]This way!
[10:37.92]This way!
[10:38.18]This way!
[10:38.46]Come on!
[10:39.24]Give me your disguise!
[10:42.94]Now, get up!
[10:44.02]Get up!
[10:45.10]Get up!
[10:45.48]Get in here!
[10:47.28]There's so many people on this top floor!
[10:50.42]Oh, I got up to 12,000 points, guys.
[10:52.46]Doing things correct.
[10:54.10]What do you know?
[10:55.60]Doing things correctly.
[10:57.94]Now where on Earth am I going?
[10:59.10]Okay, don't want to go that way.
[11:04.18]Did I just... Is this the exit?
[11:05.49]Did I do this?
[11:08.93]Pick lock?
[11:10.67]Ooh, I'm picking the lock.
[11:13.51]This is where I gotta go.
[11:14.25]I think I just did it.
[11:15.59]I just did it!
[11:17.65]No, I didn't.
[11:18.41]No, I didn't.
[11:20.99]Not quite.
[11:21.55]This is the room, though.
[11:23.63]Is this something I gotta do?
[11:25.63]What's that?
[11:29.49]A direct approach is not an option.
[11:31.43]I need an alternate point of entry.
[11:32.65]Alright, well, here we go.
[11:35.39]I'll come in like a spider.
[11:37.65]I'll snatch you up.
[11:38.59]Ooh.
[11:44.99]She's worth a lot of money.
[11:48.31]So that's the target.
[11:53.81]Alright.
[11:55.73]Come at me, bro.
[11:58.35]What's going on?
[11:59.27]Why am I on like drugs?
[12:00.11]What's going on?
[12:01.49]I'm on like drugs right now.
[12:02.47]What's happening?
[12:06.59]I think it's... What's... I did it.
[12:11.05]Nice.
[12:12.36]Alright.
[12:14.41]I unlocked some things too.
[12:16.01]Hey, that's not bad.
[12:17.23]That's not bad.
[12:18.63]I'll take a minus 5,000 points.
[12:23.04]But I got 12,000 for the first part.
[12:25.38]Oh, the second part.
[12:26.04]Let's take a look.
[12:33.38]I killed 11 people downstairs.
[12:37.07]Well, that could have been like a good score if I didn't murder 11 people.
[12:41.73]Alright, let's keep going here.
[12:44.88]Hey, how are you?
[12:47.44]That's a big dude.
[12:48.16]Oh, you're getting choked out, baby.
[12:51.50]That didn't work.
[12:54.26]No, because I'm Hitman, baby.
[12:58.82]What?
[13:00.02]Are you kidding me?
[13:05.29]I look pale.
[13:05.83]What?
[13:09.07]No, he's a goddamn hitman.
[13:10.77]He's a goddamn hitman!
[13:11.57]That's a hitman!
[13:12.13]That's a hitman!
[13:12.64]Everyone's got such a naughty, vulgar mouth.
[13:14.22]Listen to all these, like, swears.
[13:41.35]Hello.
[13:42.33]Hi there.
[13:45.09]That guy's like nine feet tall.
[13:46.61]Uh-oh.
[13:51.89]Buenos dias, Peter.
[13:53.37]Hello.
[13:54.21]This guy is a creep.
[13:56.91]Look at this guy's face.
[13:58.97]This guy is a creep.
[14:04.13]Oh, boy.
[14:07.79]That's not good.
[14:17.01]Alright, so this guy's like framing me for this murder that I just did, apparently.
[14:22.39]Now he's gonna torch the place?
[14:26.39]Oh, what a son of a bitch.
[14:34.76]Well, that's one way to go about getting yourself framed.
[14:39.10]I didn't do it, I swear.
[14:41.24]Please don't kill me.
[14:54.96]Whoa.
[14:57.84]Run for your life.
[15:00.22]Alright, let's run for our lives.
[15:03.20]So, the guy that I just went to kill, uh, torched the room and framed me.
[15:08.14]He killed some maid over here.
[15:09.90]And now these police think that I did it.
[15:13.30]Welcome to Escape the Hotel.
[15:14.50]Here we go.
[15:15.50]I have no idea where on Earth I'm going.
[15:18.54]Let's go this way.
[15:21.00]Mmm, fire, fire!
[15:22.54]Somebody put out your fire!
[15:25.30]Through here.
[15:26.40]Of course!
[15:29.18]At least I got the knife.
[15:31.36]Wow.
[15:35.12]Can only go one way.
[15:37.52]They got a helicopter on me?
[15:39.52]What is this, like America's Most Wanted?
[15:42.26]My god, stop it!
[15:43.34]Leave me alone!
[15:47.04]I gotta climb up.
[15:50.77]So, wait, wait, wait.
[15:51.55]You're telling me that from that, like, little bottle of whiskey that that guy was- Oh!
[15:57.67]Wow.
[15:59.23]Am I gonna get hit by that?
[16:02.69]You're trying to tell me what I was saying was the little thing of whiskey that that guy poured on the ground, you're telling me lit the hole, engulfed this entire hotel in flames.
[16:13.75]Are you kidding me?
[16:15.57]That's, uh, that's pretty ridiculous.
[16:18.55]Whoa.
[16:19.09]Whoa!
[16:19.47]Wow!
[16:20.23]Wait!
[16:20.65]That's a guy right there!
[16:21.47]How are they on the roof already?
[16:23.21]Can they... It's like they can't see the smoke.
[16:31.33]Alright, so see through the smoke.
[16:32.53]Go, go, go.
[16:33.59]You can't see me.
[16:34.23]You can't see me.
[16:36.75]I'm good.
[16:40.36]Can I hop over?
[16:42.14]I can't even hop over this way, can I?
[16:44.10]Get me over here!
[16:46.08]Damn it!
[16:48.44]It's alright.
[16:48.74]They can't see.
[16:49.22]They can't see anything right now.
[16:53.46]Doo-dee-doo-dee-doo!
[16:55.87]What's that?
[16:57.47]I'll take the wrench.
[17:00.39]Can I hop over this, is the question.
[17:02.37]Nope.
[17:03.51]Wait for them to go down.
[17:06.77]Come on, get out of the way!
[17:07.45]Oh, I got an idea.
[17:10.78]Go get it, officers!
[17:11.50]There's a wrench over there!
[17:15.06]Only one of you is gonna go over there and do that?
[17:18.83]Oh, wait, that guy's going over here.
[17:20.69]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[17:21.63]Hurry up and go look at the wrench!
[17:23.23]Do you have to, like, phone it in where you're going?
[17:25.95]Go, go, go.
[17:31.59]Good.
[17:34.87]Sneak through the pipes here.
[17:39.27]Hey, look at that.
[17:40.09]Beautiful.
[17:41.63]Get me the hell out of here.
[17:43.53]There's the exit, there's the exit, there's the exit.
[17:45.69]Break the door down.
[17:47.60]The question is, did I make it?
[17:52.40]Probably.
[17:55.06]Whoa!
[17:59.13]That's a pretty dramatic entrance.
[18:04.17]Chicago's finest.
[18:06.36]Where's he at, boys?
[18:10.53]And that's going to wrap it up for this episode, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:13.76]I will see you guys all for the next part where I try to escape from the Chicago Police Department.
[18:19.16]But yeah, that'll be pretty soon here, guys.
[18:20.78]So thanks so much for watching.
[18:22.29]Really do appreciate it.
[18:23.33]And take care, everybody.
