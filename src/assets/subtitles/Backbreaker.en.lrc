[00:07.51]Alright, this next one... This next one is... I only got it for one reason, and I'll explain the reason why.
[00:13.18]This game is not... This is not a game we're gonna play for very long.
[00:18.36]I promise you that.
[00:20.96]But just remember, I got this for an extremely specific reason.
[00:25.78]This is a game that everyone's gonna fucking leave.
[00:29.81]Everyone's gonna be like, I don't want to watch this.
[00:32.09]You're not going to watch it, don't worry.
[00:34.43]This is a game where it's all physics.
[00:38.44]Everything.
[00:39.88]That's all I know.
[00:41.20]The whole game is physics.
[00:42.40]And it was a disaster.
[00:43.62]The game is a fucking disaster.
[00:45.82]That's all you need to know.
[00:50.62]Let me just change this.
[00:51.60]I don't even know if I want to change this.
[00:52.56]Because I don't think we're going to be on this game for more than fucking 10 minutes.
[00:57.88]I'm going to have to change it, right?
[00:58.90]Because...
[01:05.38]Yeah, we have to.
[01:09.44]There goes 500 people.
[01:12.16]We're playing... It's a football game.
[01:14.48]Just hear me out.
[01:15.27]This is a football game, but it's a game where... I don't... Listen!
[01:20.61]This is just... Everybody calm down.
[01:27.33]It's the euphoria engine.
[01:28.61]If you don't understand... If you don't like American football...
[01:34.47]That's alright.
[01:35.85]You don't need to know anything about American football to think that this game might be fun.
[01:40.45]Stay.
[01:40.93]Stay.
[01:41.71]Sit.
[01:42.81]You... Hey.
[01:43.54]Hey.
[01:45.12]Hey.
[01:46.28]Sit.
[01:47.52]Sit.
[01:47.96]And you stay.
[01:49.40]Wait.
[01:50.88]Wait.
[01:52.60]Sit.
[01:54.68]Good boy.
[01:55.88]Good boy.
[01:57.49]Good...
[02:00.02]Training camp, exhibition.
[02:01.06]Should we just do it?
[02:01.82]I don't even- Who cares about training camp?
[02:03.28]I don't even know how to play the game.
[02:05.24]Doesn't matter.
[02:06.26]Doesn't matter.
[02:07.06]Doesn't matter.
[02:08.74]It does matter.
[02:09.28]It's a football game.
[02:09.98]It's a lot of complicated things.
[02:11.13]We're gonna just training camp.
[02:12.33]Doesn't- No, don't do it.
[02:14.25]Just go.
[02:17.33]What team do I want to be on?
[02:19.43]I'm gonna be on the home team.
[02:23.35]I'm gonna play- I'm gonna- Okay, where's like a team that's near me?
[02:26.06]Because none of these- They didn't have a goddamn license.
[02:29.88]Yeah, I can't get rid of it.
[02:31.14]The Cincinnati Hogs.
[02:33.18]Nope.
[02:34.64]Didn't get the fucking NFL license, did you?
[02:38.54]The Spectres.
[02:39.18]Alright, where's, like, the New England team?
[02:42.60]The Detroit Demons.
[02:43.41]That's pretty good.
[02:46.73]Jesus.
[02:47.91]The Green Bay Grizzlies.
[02:50.01]The Honolulu Breakers.
[02:51.23]That's cool.
[02:52.89]The Houston Wranglers.
[02:53.89]The Indianapolis Spartans.
[02:56.53]Jesus, these are fucking...
[02:59.63]These are fucking terrible.
[03:00.63]I thought that was the Boston Blues.
[03:03.69]What the fuck?
[03:04.35]What?
[03:06.71]That should be the Boston Blues.
[03:07.77]And you should come out to like... Like a jazz song.
[03:11.44]Bullshit.
[03:11.86]They fucking messed it up.
[03:14.56]Los Angeles Raptors.
[03:16.32]Miami.
[03:18.42]Where's the Boston team?
[03:20.34]Minnesota.
[03:21.10]Nashville.
[03:22.26]New England militia, baby.
[03:24.37]There it is.
[03:25.07]That's awful.
[03:25.67]You couldn't have...
[03:27.85]The militia, the Patriots.
[03:29.63]It doesn't look... It doesn't... All fucking New England teams, they don't have to be about, like, Paul Revere and freedom.
[03:36.60]Make it like the... The New England nonsense.
[03:40.16]And it's a fucking clown.
[03:41.06]Look at how good they are, too.
[03:44.34]And we're gonna go against... What's, like, the rival team?
[03:48.39]Let's see.
[03:48.63]We gotta go against, like, the New York team.
[03:52.75]The New York nincompoops!
[03:54.23]Where are they?
[03:54.75]Haha!
[03:59.40]Who cares?
[04:00.10]It doesn't matter.
[04:00.78]Where's my park?
[04:04.48]New England.
[04:05.46]The Revolution Dome.
[04:06.64]That's an actual soccer stadium.
[04:10.46]Day game.
[04:10.98]I don't know how to play.
[04:12.16]Mode?
[04:13.48]Arcade?
[04:13.92]I don't even know what this means.
[04:15.20]I should have done the training.
[04:18.43]Five minute... Whatever.
[04:19.57]I don't know how to play.
[04:26.82]I have no idea how to play this game.
[04:28.62]And there are 50,000 people watching right now.
[04:35.08]Switch camera?
[04:39.31]Hell to... Yeah!
[04:41.07]There we are.
[04:44.11]Harry Potter!
[04:47.11]What else we got?
[04:48.85]Uh, we're gonna go heads, tails, heads, tails.
[04:50.54]Come on.
[04:53.26]Heads.
[04:53.70]They are.
[04:53.92]Are they going to... Am I going to kick?
[04:55.60]They're defending.
[04:57.08]So I'm... I want to receive.
[05:00.29]There you go.
[05:00.63]We're going to go for an onside return.
[05:02.07]I think there's going to be an onside kick.
[05:04.87]Let's do it.
[05:08.22]Welcome to Backbreaker.
[05:09.24]How do I catch the ball?
[05:12.22]Oh.
[05:13.20]Hold on.
[05:14.96]Okay.
[05:23.73]Why?
[05:24.75]That music and... I just got a safety.
[05:34.64]Can you imagine being in the home team and boom, here comes the boom, it's fucking blasting.
[05:41.12]The guy receives it and gets a fucking safety.
[05:45.98]That guy better be benched for the rest of the season.
[05:50.34]Alright, uh, safety punt.
[05:53.64]How do you punt?
[05:55.40]I don't know.
[05:57.18]Uh, click kick to aim, pull back and roll.
[06:00.58]Did I do it?
[06:02.24]I think so.
[06:02.70]Alright, how do I tackle?
[06:09.14]I think I'm gonna like this game, I really do.
[06:11.54]Boom!
[06:12.18]Here comes the boom!
[06:13.52]Ready or not!
[06:15.20]Why would you do a replay?
[06:23.38]Oh, the punter is also a fucking moron.
[06:26.86]Look at this back-seeming effect.
[06:35.55]Alright, let's go for a Blitz.
[06:37.73]Everybody.
[06:38.25]Aggressive Blitz.
[06:39.13]Every single person.
[06:42.27]Doesn't matter.
[06:42.77]Just fucking Blitz.
[06:43.71]Just get ready.
[06:44.41]No encroachment.
[06:46.47]Here we go.
[06:47.71]Get a sack.
[06:48.01]They don't know what's coming.
[06:56.24]Did I win?
[06:58.95]Nah, no game.
[06:59.49]We did it.
[07:00.01]Let's see.
[07:07.79]Again!
[07:08.53]Aggressive blitz!
[07:09.69]Alright, get out of my way!
[07:13.37]Get the fuck out of my way!
[07:15.54]Aggressive blitz!
[07:18.48]Set!
[07:19.00]Hut!
[07:26.16]Do they have to show a replay every time?
[07:29.92]These guys suck!
[07:33.48]Alright, coverage, coverage.
[07:34.54]We're gonna just do regular coverage.
[07:36.52]This is the worst football... Alright, I wanna go back here.
[07:39.66]How do I change player?
[07:40.58]I don't wanna be this guy.
[07:44.45]Alright, they're going... Where are they going?
[07:48.47]Forward?
[07:50.29]I think we... We did it now, we did it.
[07:51.49]-2 yards.
[07:59.22]Dude, I can't believe.
[08:00.35]Imagine if football was this bad.
[08:02.01]Alright, punt return.
[08:03.05]I have to do well here.
[08:05.57]I have to catch the ball.
[08:06.29]I don't know how to catch the ball, but I'm sure I'll find out.
[08:08.07]Alright, here it comes.
[08:11.06]Right here.
[08:12.28]Catch it.
[08:13.84]Alright, go!
[08:16.86]Alright, it's a bright stick.
[08:19.85]I'm learning.
[08:20.43]I'm learning, I'm learning, I'm learning.
[08:21.51]We don't need to see the replay.
[08:23.55]We're gonna go for a pass play.
[08:24.65]And by the way, guys, if you've never played... If you've absolutely never played in your life a football game, always, no matter what, always, always throw a Hail Mary.
[08:36.23]The person you're playing against will fucking despise you.
[08:39.55]Because you're gonna, like, five out of ten times, you're gonna get a touchdown.
[08:42.71]Because football video games are stupid.
[08:45.41]Watch.
[08:45.99]Watch this.
[08:49.69]How do I throw the ball?
[08:52.08]I don't know how to throw the ball.
[08:53.54]But watch this.
[08:54.84]I don't know how to throw the ball.
[09:00.87]I don't understand how to throw the football.
[09:06.57]No, X is throw the ball away.
[09:10.26]Well, I'll get it back.
[09:14.90]Wait a minute.
[09:17.82]Okay, it's the right stick.
[09:19.56]Bomb pass.
[09:20.14]You go up, down.
[09:21.10]Okay, I get it.
[09:22.28]It's not X. It's the right stick.
[09:25.08]Holy shit, this game's kind of fun.
[09:26.38]Alright, here we go.
[09:40.15]No, wait.
[09:41.61]Hold on.
[09:48.46]Why?
[09:57.21]Everybody can't believe it.
[10:01.83]If sports had shit like this, man, I would never stop watching if shit like this happened in the NFL.
[10:07.86]I'm fucking crying.
[10:12.05]Oh, I guess I just turn on like the Patriots game and it's just the same shit.
[10:15.03]Imagine if like fucking Tom Brady just did this.
[10:18.47]It would be the funniest fucking thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
[10:23.28]Fuck.
[10:24.98]Imagine paying money to see this.
[10:39.19]Oh.
[10:40.53]This game is too good.
[10:42.43]Oh, man.
[10:47.34]I thought this was going to be the worst game.
[10:48.68]This is by far the best game.
[10:50.86]Without a doubt.
[10:51.58]Where am I going?
[10:55.96]I got to cover this guy.
[10:56.82]I'm supposed to be covering this guy.
[10:58.01]This is my guy.
[10:58.81]This is my guy.
[11:01.61]Alright.
[11:04.59]I don't know how to...
[11:06.88]What's the button to just grab a guy?
[11:09.50]I know it's like a penalty, but sometimes you have to do it.
[11:13.90]Balanced.
[11:15.52]Hold on.
[11:16.55]Options.
[11:17.07]Controls.
[11:18.59]Scramble.
[11:19.27]Action.
[11:20.15]Gestures.
[11:21.95]Audible.
[11:22.87]Coach cam.
[11:24.87]Coach cam.
[11:25.47]Okay, running with the ball.
[11:27.03]Running without the ball.
[11:28.44]Shred defender.
[11:29.46]Block.
[11:30.02]Barge.
[11:30.58]Hurdle.
[11:31.38]Spin.
[11:32.06]Juke.
[11:33.75]This is defense.
[11:35.47]Dive tackle, wrap tackle, barge tackle.
[11:38.23]Okay, so it's just... I just have to... I could swim.
[11:40.71]There's water in this game.
[11:43.85]Alright, I'm ready.
[11:46.61]Am I the quarterback?
[11:47.55]No.
[11:47.91]I'm on the other side.
[11:48.53]Alright, there's my guy right there.
[11:51.71]Just zone coverage.
[11:53.33]Where are they?
[11:55.83]Okay, get him.
[12:01.22]Alright, I did nothing.
[12:02.20]I just bumped into five people.
[12:04.26]Like, I fell down again.
[12:07.53]What did I do here?
[12:11.71]That's me back there.
[12:15.47]I wanted to be a linebacker.
[12:16.87]Alright, fuck it.
[12:18.85]We're going in for a blitz.
[12:19.95]And you know what?
[12:21.78]Are there rules in this one?
[12:24.40]Black!
[12:24.94]14!
[12:25.08]White!
[12:25.66]Black!
[12:25.96]14!
[12:27.04]White!
[12:36.52]Give me a fucking break, man.
[12:45.94]Come on.
[12:46.79]I have to get this guy.
[12:48.21]Where's the quarterback?
[12:56.82]I got somebody.
[12:58.42]I got somebody.
[13:08.54]You got like clothesline.
[13:10.32]God damn it, man.
[13:12.14]Just fucking field goal block.
[13:13.52]Who cares?
[13:15.84]This time, I'm not going to do that.
[13:18.04]Nope.
[13:18.32]No, no, no.
[13:18.76]No offside.
[13:19.24]What is the punch?
[13:22.85]Bumble!
[13:23.03]Get it!
[13:31.97]Get it!
[13:32.49]Get it!
[13:33.71]What?
[13:34.76]What?
[13:35.06]No!
[13:35.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[13:36.46]Replay.
[13:37.40]He popped it out of his hand.
[13:40.12]Where's the replay?
[13:41.52]Excuse me.
[13:42.64]I don't fucking think so.
[13:44.32]Don't think so.
[13:45.18]Watch this.
[13:49.42]He got up and dropped it.
[13:55.47]Here comes a fumble.
[13:56.81]And look, he stands up and just... Oops!
[13:59.37]That's not... This is very, very clearly not possession.
[14:05.64]You want to challenge that shit?
[14:06.94]I'll challenge that all day.
[14:10.00]That is by far a second fumble.
[14:13.92]Bullshit.
[14:15.10]Unbelievable.
[14:17.40]Down by contact.
[14:18.26]This isn't flag football.
[14:24.48]Here we go.
[14:28.56]I think they just got a touchdown.
[14:32.30]Yeah, they did.
[14:39.33]Why is the replay music like a 70s sci-fi?
[14:45.55]He just walked right over.
[14:46.71]Look at that guy's leg!
[14:51.21]Are they going for a field goal?
[14:54.52]I'm gonna get kicked right in the face.
[14:59.02]Get up.
[15:02.28]I'm getting booed right now.
[15:03.34]Why did they fall down?
[15:17.11]I love this game.
[15:19.59]Why did they fall down afterwards?
[15:28.27]I need to examine this, man.
[15:29.62]This is fucking perfect.
[15:32.26]Oh, man.
[15:41.62]Look at the guy on the right here.
[15:42.68]The guy on the right is like, what the fuck, man?
[15:47.74]Another attempt.
[15:48.18]We're just going to keep getting penalties.
[15:49.32]What happens if somebody was just in a real game?
[15:51.96]I want to tackle the kicker.
[15:53.85]Like, bad.
[16:01.11]Why did I fall?
[16:01.95]What?
[16:02.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:03.53]Why?
[16:04.43]My guy had a heart attack.
[16:12.75]Oh, then somebody tackled him afterwards, I think.
[16:14.55]He's getting booed.
[16:18.09]What happened after the play?
[16:20.73]I'm confused.
[16:21.25]Oh, he tripped over me.
[16:31.45]Oh, no!
[16:31.97]Nice!
[16:32.40]Whoops!
[16:34.48]You know what this is?
[16:35.18]This is just babies.
[16:37.70]These are babies.
[16:43.04]Oh, shit.
[16:43.54]Give me... Fucking hell.
[16:49.10]Come on!
[16:49.68]I was trying to, like, juke him.
[16:50.63]Alright, I'm going for run plays.
[16:51.81]Only run plays.
[16:53.67]Run.
[16:55.77]Run right.
[16:57.61]I'm getting a touchdown right here.
[16:58.89]Guaranteed.
[16:59.45]I guarantee it.
[17:00.99]Guaranteed.
[17:01.45]Do it again!
[17:09.80]Go!
[17:14.30]What happened?
[17:18.26]What?
[17:22.55]Why did I just throw the ball into the gauntlet?
[17:24.21]It was like a bouncy ball.
[17:25.17]What the fuck happened?
[17:30.33]Alright, snap.
[17:30.77]Here we go.
[17:31.99]I want to actually throw the ball.
[17:36.32]You fucking idiot.
[17:37.06]You suck.
[17:40.58]What happened to the guy that I was... What happened to this guy?
[17:51.74]No, I don't want to punt.
[17:52.68]I'm not punting.
[17:55.22]How do I say no, I don't want to punt?
[17:57.73]Is it already... How do I fake punt?
[18:03.92]Come on, this has got to be like another punt, right?
[18:08.17]No, no.
[18:08.81]God damn it.
[18:11.95]Give me the ball.
[18:29.14]This game is... Can I just give myself... Look, minus 7, minus 19.
[18:34.32]Can't get into the stands.
[18:38.88]I need to hurt somebody.
[18:41.77]Like, I have to get one good tackle.
[18:45.87]You have to punt.
[18:46.41]You can fake punt.
[18:52.81]No gain.
[18:53.41]Good so far.
[18:55.65]I'm happy with that.
[18:56.89]Coverage.
[18:57.63]Deep coverage.
[18:58.11]I think they're gonna go for a pass here.
[19:01.10]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna just fucking shoulder my way into the quarterback.
[19:08.02]Here we go.
[19:12.90]Minus one yard.
[19:13.60]Did my job.
[19:15.53]Did it correctly.
[19:16.43]No yard gainage.
[19:18.43]This guy will go for an aggressive blitz.
[19:24.55]I have to get a touchdown, otherwise what's the point of doing this?
[19:33.09]Get out of the fucking way Got it No game, they have to punt Punt returned I have to get a touchdown, give me one touchdown Give me one touchdown before we go to the next game
[19:53.05]That's it.
[19:54.39]Okay, where's turbo?
[19:57.27]It's not turbo.
[20:01.83]Let's go.
[20:02.92]Pass.
[20:03.94]Standard pass.
[20:05.86]I'm ready.
[20:10.14]Fake snap.
[20:10.56]Snap it.
[20:12.86]Got it.
[20:17.20]Nice, four yards.
[20:20.16]Hurry up, offense.
[20:20.96]Again.
[20:21.54]Quick.
[20:22.30]Go.
[20:23.20]We're gonna go to the same guy every time.
[20:27.30]Get you on that fucking team.
[20:29.72]Hurry up.
[20:30.02]Again.
[20:30.44]Same guy.
[20:32.08]Hey, Bob Craft, if you're watching this stream, 2025, Patriots coach.
[20:35.33]What?
[20:35.55]Is that guy sliding?
[20:49.96]What happened?
[20:55.02]Did I win?
[20:57.94]Wait, okay.
[20:59.74]We're fine, everything's alright.
[21:02.41]Alright, here we go.
[21:03.03]Easy, same guy.
[21:06.43]Deep pass!
[21:09.85]Ooh, that's what I call a first down, 19 yards.
[21:15.98]Again.
[21:17.02]Pass.
[21:18.62]First of many.
[21:19.38]I got one.
[21:19.80]I gave him a short pass.
[21:24.24]Hey, Bill Belichick.
[21:26.36]Excuse me.
[21:27.56]Offensive lineman for next season.
[21:30.30]Look at that one.
[21:40.82]That guy went invisible through me.
[21:51.96]I have to get a touchdown.
[21:53.98]I have to get a touchdown.
[21:56.22]How do I like spin it around?
[22:02.97]There's so many people in here.
[22:04.17]Look at that!
[22:07.06]Oh, what?
[22:08.14]No!
[22:18.66]I'm so lost.
[22:20.38]Again, this is like child, like fourth grade football.
[22:27.03]It doesn't matter.
[22:28.23]Look, I'm glad this happened because I want to get one touchdown before this is over.
[22:33.45]How do you taunt?
[22:34.07]Let's taunt.
[22:44.74]What did I do?
[22:45.38]I, like, put my hands in and tried to block it.
[22:49.20]Alright, kick.
[22:50.40]Kick it.
[22:54.44]Oh, my fucking nose hurts.
[22:57.02]Oh, shit.
[23:01.75]Wait.
[23:03.85]All I can do is, like, giggle at this game.
[23:05.69]This is, like, too fun.
[23:07.57]I'm having a great time.
[23:08.93]This time, don't pass it into somebody else's hand.
[23:13.60]Same deal, just play like you'd be playing against your older brother who gets really angry at you.
[23:18.94]He's wide open!
[23:20.00]WAIT!
[23:20.98]DON'T!
[23:22.26]NO!
[23:22.80]WHAT?!
[23:23.56]UGH!
[23:25.58]Why did that fucking happen?
[23:27.05]Why did that happen?
[23:29.63]God damn it, he was wide open!
[23:33.47]I gotta get a first down.
[23:37.69]Right there.
[23:39.09]Got it.
[23:39.97]Oh my god, you fucking idiots.
[23:48.35]Guy on the right.
[23:52.83]Guy on the right.
[23:53.33]Come on.
[23:54.53]He's wide open.
[23:55.39]Nobody even... My fucking god.
[23:58.12]What is the back... What is backhanded slap?
[24:08.49]I don't even... I don't even... Selecting it.
[24:13.33]What is that?
[24:19.21]I have a new tactic.
[24:19.83]You guys want to see my new tactic?
[24:22.57]It's switch to every single player and dive.
[24:26.77]Hope you guys are ready.
[24:28.44]It's switch to every single person and hit the dive button.
[24:32.70]This is a tactic I used to do too as well.
[24:39.08]No game.
[24:39.48]Seems like it works pretty well.
[24:45.78]Do it again.
[24:48.54]Switch to every person and dive.
[24:53.62]No matter what the outcome is, you'll always win.
[25:00.75]One yard.
[25:01.09]Take a look at that replay.
[25:07.21]Notice all the people falling down.
[25:08.91]If you make a blockade big enough, they can't walk over you.
[25:11.35]See?
[25:12.75]Now they're on third down.
[25:21.72]And what happened?
[25:24.05]What happened?
[25:28.95]Oh, the game's... Oh, that's the end of the first quarter.
[25:32.20]Alright, doesn't change a thing.
[25:35.24]Doesn't change a thing.
[25:36.24]I'm still going for it.
[25:51.71]38 yards.
[25:53.14]Just let him get a point.
[25:55.62]I don't care.
[25:56.72]I want to get a touchdown.
[25:57.46]I don't care what happens.
[26:08.02]I have to get a touchdown, guys.
[26:09.30]I can't play a football game and not get a touchdown.
[26:11.49]What's it like to sit the guys on the sidelines?
[26:19.13]There is a sprint.
[26:20.71]That changes everything.
[26:25.03]I just figured out the sprint button.
[26:34.37]Just fucking riled up.
[26:36.21]Come on!
[26:36.69]Snap the ball!
[26:43.13]I can sprint with the ball and run.
[26:46.07]What's the score?
[26:49.21]Field goal.
[26:49.65]No, don't even block the field goal.
[26:50.73]Can I skip the field goal?
[26:58.38]They're going to get it, so it doesn't matter.
[27:00.42]When is the NFL going to get rid of the point after?
[27:04.68]Okay, kickoff return.
[27:07.33]Go for it.
[27:07.87]I can do a coach kick.
[27:10.91]Why would I do a coach kick?
[27:16.35]Explain to me how you didn't catch that.
[27:21.94]Honestly, we're sitting.
[27:24.28]How does that go through your legs?
[27:27.49]Why does that go through your legs?
[27:31.99]The guy just forgot to catch the ball.
[27:36.09]Mm-hmm.
[27:36.73]That's good.
[27:37.59]Now I'm fucked.
[27:42.17]Alright, QB sneak.
[27:50.80]I got, you can't tell me that I didn't get just fucked right there.
[28:17.53]What's the score?
[28:21.57]How do I take the brass knuckles out of my boot and punch somebody?
[28:37.96]What's the score?
[28:38.52]I can't tell.
[28:48.62]What is seven yards?
[28:49.98]What?
[28:51.70]Did he throw the ball behind him?
[28:54.66]He threw the ball behind him!
[29:01.53]How am I doing this?
[29:03.95]Am I actually gonna force them to cook a field goal?
[29:21.14]We're right on the goal line.
[29:23.70]Field goal.
[29:24.52]Yeah.
[29:25.42]Stopped into a field goal.
[29:26.80]What do you know?
[29:27.28]Alright, let's see if I can jump up and jump in the air and bat it.
[29:34.28]Almost got it.
[29:41.95]Wait, hold on.
[29:44.31]Oh my god, somebody gave $100.
[29:45.11]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[29:46.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[29:48.95]Fox of Fury.
[29:51.26]Gave $100.
[29:54.48]Thank you so much, Fox.
[29:56.30]That's fucking a huge amount of money, first of all.
[29:58.65]And second of all, another good tactic is to rapidly rotate through the players and spam taunt.
[30:05.97]Don't tell me I can do that.
[30:07.95]Is there a taunt?
[30:10.58]Coach cam gestures?
[30:12.16]I don't know.
[30:15.04]Action?
[30:15.30]Spin?
[30:17.50]Spin?
[30:20.29]Bull rush, dive tackle, bullet pass, pump fake, fake snap, juke spin, hurdle, dive, QB slide, stiff arm, protect ball.
[30:34.45]Oh, I don't think there's a taunt.
[30:37.05]Gestures sounds like a taunt.
[30:38.29]No, gestures is like this thing, the juke, the spin, the hurdle.
[30:46.52]But thank you, Fox of Fury, for your $100.
[30:52.13]That is a taunt.
[30:52.93]There is a taunt.
[30:53.55]Well, how do I do it?
[31:01.28]Six fish as well.
[31:01.98]Thanks for the one buck.
[31:03.23]Jerma, I wish... Jerma, I just want you to know that... I just want you to know that while all value and appreciate you as I eat asshole... Okay.
[31:11.59]Well, thanks for the $1, dude.
[31:13.81]Garrett, thanks for the $1.
[31:14.81]Jerma, why are you so bad at football?
[31:16.55]I don't know the controls!
[31:19.69]Thank you.
[31:20.01]Thank you, Frexter, for the $1.
[31:21.11]Here's some stream tax.
[31:24.04]Cool Cat, thanks for the $15.
[31:25.38]Hoarder Alliance, Alliance.
[31:27.74]I played Alliance 95% of the time that I played well.
[31:32.64]But thank you, Cool Cat, for the $15.
[31:33.70]I don't think there's a ton.
[31:38.66]Look, nothing matters.
[31:39.80]The only thing that matters at this point is to get a touchdown.
[31:44.48]Again, why is that happening?
[31:51.13]Why is that happening?
[31:52.39]That's the only time...
[31:55.95]Run.
[31:56.63]We're gonna do a run.
[31:57.93]We're gonna run left.
[32:01.21]I know how to do this shit.
[32:02.87]I used to fucking actually play Madden back in the day.
[32:07.25]That was -2 yards.
[32:09.08]Sorry.
[32:09.54]I need to... R3?
[32:17.48]R3.
[32:19.44]I don't think I can do it yet.
[32:23.70]Holy shit, man.
[32:28.91]Pass.
[32:29.37]It's got to be just a standard pass.
[32:34.71]This is not your father's Madden.
[32:40.90]Got it.
[32:45.60]Where's the ball?
[32:49.81]Did I get it?
[33:05.84]He got it.
[33:06.24]No, he didn't get it.
[33:07.37]I didn't get it, I don't think.
[33:08.37]Nobody knows where they're going.
[33:15.77]Wait.
[33:17.86]Who got the ball?
[33:25.50]Free cam.
[33:26.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[33:26.62]First of all, free cam.
[33:29.61]Pause it.
[33:35.96]Oh, fuck you.
[33:41.78]Where is it?
[33:42.18]Right here?
[33:43.65]Okay, here it is.
[33:50.33]Nobody picked up the ball.
[33:53.63]Nobody decided they wanted to... I think I just got the ball.
[33:56.43]Look, they thought the ball was over here.
[33:59.98]What were these guys doing over here?
[34:05.53]Nobody picks up the ball.
[34:06.39]I got it by default.
[34:09.71]Wait, no I didn't.
[34:12.97]Oh, for the love of God.
[34:16.01]R3?
[34:16.05]R3 isn't doing anything.
[34:19.68]I'm doing R3.
[34:26.74]It's not R3.
[34:30.68]God fucking damn it, man.
[34:32.34]I just, I need to get a touchdown.
[34:36.37]It's just so stupid.
[34:37.43]I need to fucking score a point.
[34:39.67]Even if I have to kick a field goal.
[34:43.70]Bubble!
[34:48.26]Please stop the switching shit.
[34:51.72]I'm sorry.
[34:53.09]I had to.
[34:57.23]Use the middle stick.
[34:58.15]What middle stick?
[35:03.39]Got him.
[35:05.73]I actually helped with that, I did.
[35:10.41]I bumped into that guy.
[35:13.89]I bumped into that guy's shoulder.
[35:15.27]That's the PS problem.
[35:21.49]Just let him get the field goal.
[35:22.57]Did I get him?
[35:26.11]Yeah.
[35:26.51]Okay, kick is good.
[35:30.55]Just go.
[35:31.91]Just please give it to me.
[35:33.65]I need to.
[35:36.34]So desperately just want... I'm going to kick a field goal.
[35:40.76]Finally.
[35:44.78]It's alright.
[35:45.52]I just need to get into field goal range.
[35:48.55]And get points.
[35:49.33]That's all I want.
[35:50.61]I'm going to ask the coach.
[35:52.45]Coach wants me to go right up the middle.
[35:54.97]I'm going to listen to him.
[36:01.72]Coach, you suck.
[36:05.16]Fuck you, coach.
[36:08.77]I've walked into the same guy.
[36:11.53]Pass.
[36:11.79]We're going to go shotgun pass.
[36:16.06]I'm going to... Okay, this is second and ten.
[36:24.40]Somebody say who's offside.
[36:28.06]God damn it.
[36:28.44]Come on.
[36:29.04]Third down.
[36:31.17]It's a play-action fake.
[36:32.01]Guy on the left.
[36:33.37]Okay.
[36:41.37]Beautiful!
[36:42.20]That's how you fucking get up a field.
[36:44.00]That's how you get yardage.
[36:46.94]Oh shit, I have two minutes.
[36:50.86]Where's the clock?
[36:52.00]Where's the clock?
[36:52.40]Down?
[36:53.16]I have one... How many timeouts do I have?
[36:54.78]Two timeouts?
[36:58.47]Throw the fucking football!
[36:59.83]What are you doing?
[37:00.99]Why did he not throw the football?
[37:03.37]Why did you not throw the football?
[37:04.79]Oh, you dickhead.
[37:06.73]Why?
[37:07.37]I was pressing rights.
[37:08.33]This is why you don't ever have an analog pass button.
[37:17.53]It's alright.
[37:17.89]I got it back.
[37:18.97]Gained it back.
[37:25.71]What we at?
[37:26.31]Second and... Third and two.
[37:27.91]Run.
[37:28.69]Just stuff up the middle.
[37:30.03]Just go right in the top left middle.
[37:31.94]Top left middle.
[37:32.52]Come on.
[37:34.24]I'll get up.
[37:34.60]I'll get there.
[37:35.12]I'll get there.
[37:35.80]First down.
[37:37.10]First down!
[37:38.70]Got it!
[37:41.30]What's going on?
[37:41.98]What's going on?
[37:42.44]What's going on?
[37:43.10]Why am I... Why am I in like a fucking Twilight Zone?
[37:45.64]Why am I doing this again?
[37:51.16]Huh?
[37:52.50]Did he just repeat the last play?
[37:54.56]None of them can get up.
[37:59.65]Watch this.
[38:00.09]Nobody can get up.
[38:02.41]They keep sliding on top of each other.
[38:08.19]They're like, you're going to have to move first, man.
[38:12.63]Short pass.
[38:15.27]Second and 11.
[38:15.71]I'm going to go for the guy on the right.
[38:21.81]Bingo.
[38:23.61]That better not be a taunt.
[38:24.48]The button is X to taunt?
[38:27.32]Hold on, we'll talk about that in a minute, because I'm going to be taunting a shitload if I get this.
[38:30.32]Pass.
[38:31.88]Another play action.
[38:32.60]Come on.
[38:32.92]This is third down.
[38:33.58]This is important.
[38:34.98]I'm in field goal range.
[38:40.77]That's a deep bomb!
[38:54.25]And what if I happen to pass interference?
[38:55.92]That guy was lying on the ground.
[39:44.76]You know what?
[39:45.56]We're just going to let him get it.
[39:47.22]Because I'm going to try one more time.
[39:52.06]I'm going to throw just a Hail Mary to the end zone.
[39:55.20]They have timeouts.
[39:56.02]I forgot.
[39:56.70]This is fine.
[39:57.22]The clock's going to run out.
[39:58.16]This doesn't even matter.
[40:14.89]No, we can't.
[40:15.49]I'm telling you, I can't next right now.
[40:18.13]I'm invested in trying to get one point.
[40:21.61]And I mean one point.
[40:28.16]I almost had that.
[40:33.32]First down.
[40:33.76]Don't matter.
[40:34.28]Go.
[40:34.88]Come on.
[40:35.70]Do your timeout.
[40:38.00]Oh, shit.
[40:38.50]Wait a minute.
[40:41.23]I'm not going to get the ball back.
[40:45.58]I need to do everything in my power to make... Interception!
[40:48.38]Ah!
[40:55.15]What do they have to do?
[41:00.75]Does everyone watch?
[41:04.80]Did it.
[41:06.22]Pretty good job, I say.
[41:09.32]Got a sack there, boys and girls.
[41:11.30]Look at that.
[41:11.98]Right up the middle.
[41:20.56]Third and 16.
[41:21.00]I'm going to get the ball back.
[41:23.41]Because they're not going to be able to get a field goal.
[41:27.41]Got that one too.
[41:30.91]Now they're going to kick a field goal.
[41:32.51]No, they're doing a punt.
[41:33.19]Alright.
[41:33.41]This is my chance.
[41:34.07]I got 24 seconds.
[41:35.33]23 seconds.
[41:35.79]21 seconds.
[41:36.79]Timeout.
[41:41.72]It took you a long time to do that.
[41:44.38]Come on.
[41:47.82]I got one more.
[41:48.26]Two more timeouts.
[41:52.19]I can get to midfield, and then I can kick a field goal.
[42:00.58]Alright, just get 20 yards, and then there it is.
[42:03.60]Field goal.
[42:07.18]14 seconds.
[42:08.83]Stop doing replays.
[42:10.01]Okay, pass.
[42:24.26]Yeah, select his timeout.
[42:27.54]Oh, you suck so much.
[42:32.89]Nice back break.
[42:35.45]Fucking hell.
[42:38.67]Can I select a different fucking play?
[42:41.73]Why do I only get like three plays?
[42:48.78]Wait, I'm not the quarterback anymore.
[43:00.59]25 yards, baby!
[43:09.83]Hey, you know what?
[43:11.87]Let's do a run play here.
[43:13.93]I'm gonna do it a run right.
[43:15.58]Wait a second!
[43:37.39]Let's watch the halftime show.
[44:05.16]Hey, notice how I haven't had one highlight?
[44:08.86]Not one.
[44:10.66]This is just a promotional video for the other team.
[44:15.18]This is what they leak out to the press before every game.
[44:21.48]Not one highlight, it's just me getting stomped.
[44:34.60]I don't think... Audibles?
[44:35.56]I don't think any of this... Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:38.79]Okay, now I can change these.
[44:42.23]Gun Hail Mary.
[45:20.92]I'm ready.
[45:24.86]Here we go.
[45:28.92]Oh, he's supposed to hold down a lot longer than that.
[45:39.60]Not this time.
[45:44.53]How do I do an audible?
[45:54.22]Boom, here goes the boom.
[45:56.12]Ready or not.
[45:57.48]Boom, here goes the boom.
[46:03.63]We've spent more time on football than any other dumb PS3 game we have.
[46:09.23]Ridiculous.
[46:12.89]God.
[46:13.07]No, no, I don't want to be this guy.
[46:18.20]I don't want to be that guy either.
[46:19.94]I want to be this guy.
[46:30.17]I don't know what happened there.
[46:33.51]This is third.
[46:34.39]This is important.
[46:35.19]I'm gonna go for... I'm gonna just go for coverage here.
[46:37.71]Shallow coverage.
[46:38.99]We're not going for a bomb pass here.
[46:44.61]Just gotta get in the zone.
[46:45.65]I gotta stay back in the zone here.
[46:49.25]That's how you stop it.
[46:50.93]That's how you stop it and prevent a first down.
[47:09.95]God damn it, why am I... Just give me the ball back and I'm gonna let the computer play for me.
[47:17.51]Get me in range so I can get the touchdown.
[47:22.66]It's zone.
[47:23.38]It's a zone.
[47:23.86]It's just doing a zone.
[47:25.04]Right here.
[47:25.52]Bingo.
[47:25.68]Not gonna throw to this guy, are you?
[47:26.96]Oh, no.
[47:30.52]Attack with my own guy.
[47:33.20]Oh, fucking hell.
[47:39.58]When are the Zumbinis gonna come?
[47:43.38]We need the Zambonis.
[47:45.52]Is there any... Is there... I don't think there's any passing appearance.
[47:56.81]They're right over there.
[48:00.40]We're gonna start the Zumbinis probably next week.
[48:03.06]There's one other game I want to play on Tuesday.
[48:04.46]Alright, see?
[48:12.33]What?
[48:14.83]Why would you still throw it over here?
[48:20.19]Oh my god.
[48:21.55]So there is pass interference.
[48:22.65]Why didn't I get pass interference?
[48:25.81]When the guy clearly, like, grabbed me by the face mask and threw me down.
[48:30.53]And that was not it, apparently.
[48:34.53]He's still not down.
[48:39.09]Okay, I'm gonna give myself one more chance and then I'm done with this game.
[48:46.23]My next possession is the last possession.
[48:50.88]And I have to get points.
[48:56.66]What the fuck was that?
[49:01.12]Do it again, Blitz.
[49:02.08]Third down.
[49:05.61]I'm addicted to Backbreaker.
[49:07.09]Even though this game is stupid.
[49:09.39]This game has like a 4 out of 10 from every outlet.
[49:12.25]But I have to play it.
[49:15.91]Interception!
[49:18.24]I got it.
[49:21.58]Who intercepted it?
[49:25.32]Nice work.
[49:26.42]Oh, that's awful though.
[49:28.14]This is terrible.
[49:30.30]Where's my audible?
[49:32.94]How do you do an audible?
[49:36.23]Oh, down.
[49:36.73]Okay.
[49:41.33]Audible.
[49:45.24]Why is Audible not working?
[49:46.20]Audible.
[49:48.48]It says down on the D-pad?
[49:49.88]Left on the D-pad?
[49:50.42]It should be working, right?
[49:51.14]It's not doing anything.
[49:59.94]Come on.
[50:05.48]Audible.
[50:10.47]Like, it doesn't matter.
[50:10.97]Standard pass.
[50:11.71]Audible.
[50:15.14]No, it ain't doing shit.
[50:16.48]Alright, that's some gainage.
[50:26.04]I got it.
[50:26.38]First and ten.
[50:29.65]We just have to get, like, somewhere up the field.
[50:31.59]Okay, now I'm gonna do pass play.
[50:33.95]Standard pass.
[50:35.51]Except I'm gonna pick a different person.
[50:37.09]I'm gonna pick, like, I'm gonna pick this guy.
[50:40.54]So I get to protect the quarterback.
[50:45.25]Protect the quarterback, that's all I care about.
[50:48.57]Fucking god damn.
[50:51.95]Do it again.
[50:58.74]Did he do it?
[51:01.52]Ooh, 30 fucking yards.
[51:07.98]Good eyes, strong arms, safe hands.
[51:11.34]Hey guys, what do you say we do that same thing?
[51:13.76]No, we're gonna do a play action.
[51:15.30]Wait, shit, I have to control it.
[51:22.16]You fucking idiot!
[51:29.93]No!
[51:30.33]Why would you go step that fucking far, you dumb fucking... Leave it to the professionals.
[51:52.08]Third and 10.
[51:53.04]Oh, god damn it.
[51:56.28]How many yards out am I?
[51:57.47]On the 40.
[51:57.73]You gotta make this happen, man.
[52:00.75]Come on.
[52:01.85]Play action.
[52:03.59]Fuck, it's my... Come on.
[52:11.98]There it is.
[52:18.77]Wait, there was a penalty.
[52:19.45]There was a penalty.
[52:19.95]There was a penalty.
[52:20.41]Who's penalty?
[52:21.05]Put it back in.
[52:21.91]Get it back in.
[52:22.66]Who was the penalty on?
[52:25.92]Get it back in.
[52:27.69]There was a penalty there.
[52:54.40]God damn it.
[52:55.24]No, we didn't catch it.
[52:56.45]We didn't catch it quick enough.
[52:58.75]But what if my little brother came over and pressed the button?
[53:06.59]It was defensive pass interference.
[53:15.78]Ay-yi-yi.
[53:17.46]Can I just... Okay, I've got a plan.
[53:19.79]Hold on.
[53:21.91]Was it on them?
[53:23.88]It uses an autosave feature.
[53:25.06]Do not switch off your PS3.
[53:26.28]Hold on.
[53:28.64]Wait a minute, guys.
[53:29.86]I think we might have an opportunity to continue that game.
[53:35.65]Continue game?
[53:39.27]Where's continue the last game?
[53:49.54]Locker room?
[53:54.81]Are there cheats for this fucking game?
[53:57.95]Are there like GoldenEye007 dumb cheats for this game?
[54:00.59]Wait a minute.
[54:10.95]One sec.
[54:20.39]I don't think there are any cheats.
[54:21.97]I don't think there's been anything.
[54:30.19]No, I guess there's not.
[54:32.65]Oh well.
[54:35.31]Alright, there's one thing I have to do.
[54:40.78]I don't know what this is.
[54:41.54]What is Tackle Alley?
[54:47.40]Don't you just want to know what this is?
[54:53.28]I'm curious as to what Tackle Alley is.
[55:00.18]Wave one.
[55:03.75]What do I have to do?
[55:08.33]Oh, I just have to get down the field.
[55:10.39]Oh, easy.
[55:12.55]I win.
[55:12.87]Touchdown!
[55:17.62]There it is!
[55:18.12]I got my touchdown.
[55:23.92]Wave one.
[55:24.64]Wave two.
[55:29.87]I'm just gonna go like this.
[55:30.53]I'm gonna hold on to the ball for dear life.
[55:39.24]That was fucking easy.
[55:43.97]Wave three.
[55:45.93]So just avoid... Just don't go in the aggro circle.
[55:51.73]See, I'm not in... I didn't aggro this guy.
[56:00.42]It's really easy if you don't fucking go in their hostile section.
[56:06.04]Now it's like showboating over here.
[56:09.22]Wave 4.
[56:09.46]Let's try to get like this correct.
[56:20.86]This guy's aggro section is right like here, so... Oh shit.
[56:24.96]Fuck, I pulled the whole... I pulled the whole camp!
[56:31.77]Dive?
[56:33.31]Oh my god.
[56:38.02]I'm on wave 5, guys.
[56:45.56]Please stop.
[56:46.44]No, hold on.
[56:46.84]We need to see what Tackle Alley is.
[56:50.14]I need to at least win something in this game.
[56:59.91]How long does this go on for?
[57:03.66]Alright, let's hot potato the ball.
[57:10.62]Got the wave five.
[57:11.56]No, wave six.
[57:12.88]When does this end?
[57:14.50]I want to do the tackling.
[57:20.59]Alright, that's it.
[57:22.15]I don't want to... I'm done.
[57:23.81]This is cool.
[57:25.33]This is cool, but I'm finished with this game.
[57:31.21]I'm done with this game, and we're going to go on.
[57:35.75]Alright, well, there was your comedy.
[57:37.47]Because now we're moving on to... This is going to be quicker than Backbreaker.
[57:44.79]I guarantee it.
[57:46.66]You want to hear a 100% guarantee?
[57:50.98]This is going to be like... This one will be probably like 5 to 10 minutes.
[57:59.58]I would be surprised if it wasn't.
[58:04.68]No, it's not Backbreaker 2.
[58:05.84]That's what I said last time.
[58:08.24]I know, but you never know.
[58:10.16]We could hit gold here.
[58:14.06]I don't even know why I bought this.
[58:21.90]Oh, that was fun, though.
[58:23.76]Look, if anything, that was fun.
[58:28.04]I had a good time.
[58:29.98]I actually had a blast playing that.
[58:35.08]We don't have very many more.
[58:36.24]I just wanted to... Today was like off schedule.
[58:37.70]I just wanted to get a handful of these because this is the end of the PS4.
[58:43.11]PS3.
[58:45.85]Five to ten minutes is three hours.
