[00:09.10]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.98]Jerma here with Hitman Absolution.
[00:14.50]This game came out literally last night, and I am giddy as a horse on a track.
[00:20.31]I don't even know what the context of that actually means, but I cannot wait to play this game.
[00:24.17]I've been waiting for this game for so long, and it's finally here.
[00:27.19]So, what do you say we start this Let's Play, baby?
[00:30.15]Doing it right from scratch.
[00:31.09]I've never played one second of this game, so this is completely blind, and let's go.
[00:37.70]Listen to me.
[00:43.01]I need you to be brave.
[00:51.05]A man will come and take you away.
[00:57.41]Alright, so.
[00:59.11]I think I have completed the tutorial so far.
[01:03.41]The lady was just, like, talking in my ear, so I was like, you know what?
[01:05.95]We're, like, gonna just skip right through this.
[01:07.62]So, what I've learned so far is how to essentially play the game.
[01:10.92]And that's good!
[01:13.04]So, I'm gonna try... Oh, he's talking.
[01:15.60]Alright.
[01:15.86]So, S, climb down.
[01:23.65]I'm doing some... I thought I fell.
[01:26.99]Oh, boy.
[01:35.32]Move on.
[01:35.84]I gotta see if anyone's in here.
[01:37.34]Nope.
[01:37.56]Move past window.
[01:38.16]Go!
[01:40.78]Move past window again.
[01:41.52]Go!
[01:41.72]This is some James Bond crap here.
[01:45.79]Jump up there, baby.
[01:47.68]But, yes, I have to kill my old contractor.
[01:51.32]So, let's see.
[01:51.96]Oh, boy.
[01:53.56]This place is heavily guarded.
[01:58.34]Can I, like, shoot this guy in his face?
[02:00.91]Oh, nope.
[02:01.67]I'm good.
[02:01.99]I'm good.
[02:02.21]Yeah, get out of my... I'm trying to sneak around here.
[02:05.71]Yeah, get out of my face.
[02:08.23]Get out of the window, man.
[02:22.76]Why did I do that?
[02:23.26]That means I gotta kill this guy now.
[02:24.88]Damn it.
[02:25.67]Alright, we did it.
[02:36.94]Yeah, I'll change it.
[02:37.42]Alright, gotta put my weapon away.
[02:39.33]Gotta drag this guy out of the way.
[02:40.85]Come here.
[02:41.73]I'm gonna hide you behind here.
[02:43.19]That was kind of unnecessary, but you know, whatever.
[02:46.03]Can I throw him out the window?
[02:46.91]Oh, I think I can dump this guy out the freaking window.
[03:08.43]See you later, buddy.
[03:09.31]Oh, no.
[03:09.85]All I gotta do is do this guy, too.
[03:15.95]Wait, any guards?
[03:17.67]Oh, yeah.
[03:18.11]Holding down control lets you do something called instinct, which lets you blend in and see kind of through walls.
[03:23.82]So let's dump this guy now, too.
[03:25.18]Hey, you friends out there, you wanna go see him?
[03:27.00]No, I don't wanna do this.
[03:28.12]No, please.
[03:28.82]Alright, let's be careful here.
[03:33.44]No.
[03:35.26]I don't see anybody.
[03:36.38]Here's the exit right here.
[03:39.29]Open.
[03:40.51]Okay.
[03:46.77]Can I open the fridge?
[03:48.55]Disable security system.
[03:49.85]Where is it?
[03:50.23]Okay, security system's over there.
[03:53.15]Gotta disable it so I can kill my target, Diana Stevenson, whatever her name is.
[03:57.33]Uh, evidence.
[04:00.99]Bullet.
[04:01.21]Perfect.
[04:08.45]Yeah, my meter on the bottom right, if you don't know what it is, instinct, that depletes the more I hold down control.
[04:15.61]So, wait, what is this disguise?
[04:16.67]Is this a new disguise?
[04:18.23]Can I put this on?
[04:19.65]Oh, I already have that one on.
[04:21.47]If you don't know what Hitman disguising is, when you kill people or you knock them out, you can take their clothing and blend in with places that you belong.
[04:30.19]So, it's very, very interesting.
[04:31.81]Huh?
[04:32.07]Ooh.
[04:32.23]Okay.
[04:32.37]Mmm.
[04:32.55]Good luck.
[04:32.85]Alright.
[04:33.03]Here we go.
[04:50.03]Get keycard from head of security.
[04:51.91]Look at all those guys.
[04:55.98]Whoa, that guy's right there.
[04:59.12]That guy's path is up there.
[05:00.10]Hmm.
[05:10.09]Alright, what is this pot?
[05:11.89]Do I like it?
[05:12.31]I don't know, I'm scared.
[05:13.01]Let's go, man.
[05:13.51]Get out of this room.
[05:16.65]I want to poison you.
[05:19.71]Oh my god, he's coming over here.
[05:22.25]Oh my god.
[05:38.99]Alright, I'm killing this guy.
[05:40.15]The heat should dissolve any hint of foreign substance.
[05:58.67]So wait, I gotta poison this stuff?
[06:01.27]Oh, his knife just disappeared!
[06:02.41]Oh boy!
[06:03.07]Oh boy, I'm playing Ring Around the Rosie with the chef!
[06:05.65]Oh boy!
[06:06.21]Ring Around the Rosie!
[06:06.99]Oh boy!
[06:09.03]Oh no!
[06:10.36]I killed the chef!
[06:12.56]Get over here!
[06:13.62]Get over here!
[06:14.44]Come here!
[06:16.68]Come here, you fat bastard!
[06:19.22]I'm gonna put you in the freezer!
[06:23.55]Oh, I'm going to take his clothes.
[06:24.55]I'm going to be like Chef 47.
[06:26.03]Here we go.
[06:26.75]Is it going to look so stupid?
[06:28.37]Oh, nice.
[06:28.71]Oh.
[06:28.81]Alright, let's see.
[06:29.67]What about my world famous fish dish?
[06:50.89]And I'm good.
[06:52.51]Except for like the big pool of blood over here.
[06:54.63]I think I'm doing alright right now.
[06:56.53]Anything else I can grab over here?
[06:59.17]No, I don't have any visible guns.
[07:01.29]Let's go through here.
[07:02.71]Looking for the head of security is over there.
[07:04.91]There he is.
[07:06.19]Gotta get his key card.
[07:09.00]I'm disguised as a chef.
[07:09.96]We're good.
[07:10.28]Wait.
[07:14.98]For those of you who do not know the drill, I will personally appoint a close protection host for each client on a six-hour shift cycle.
[07:23.02]You will not, I repeat, not leave your VIP side for any reason during your shift.
[07:29.93]Any breach of procedure will result in immediate termination and subsequent blacklisting.
[07:35.01]Rest assured, if you fail in your duties, you'll never work in this business again.
[07:39.05]This is all.
[07:40.93]Dismissed.
[07:42.73]Let's go upstairs.
[07:43.85]I gotta find, like, poison or something.
[07:45.45]Trespassing?
[07:46.11]What?
[07:47.11]Oh, damn.
[07:48.11]Oh, hi.
[07:49.23]Hello there, sir.
[07:51.63]Yes, I know.
[07:52.21]I'm going back downstairs.
[07:53.57]Don't worry.
[07:54.15]I'm just gonna... Just gonna go downstairs for a second here and, uh... Just, uh... Yeah, don't worry about the MasterChef.
[08:05.81]Oh, don't you worry about a thing.
[08:07.47]Shh, quiet, quiet.
[08:10.37]Yes, yes.
[08:13.33]Now come with me.
[08:15.63]I'll take this disguise from you.
[08:18.62]And then I'm gonna dump your ass into here.
[08:23.80]Okay.
[08:25.81]I need to find a solution.
[08:26.79]I could just go guns blazing, but I don't want to really do that.
[08:29.73]I do that way too often in games.
[08:31.97]Sleeping pills.
[08:32.73]Ooh.
[08:34.37]Ooh, sleeping pills.
[08:36.53]Bang.
[08:37.47]You know it.
[08:37.95]Activate checkpoint.
[08:39.10]Hell yeah.
[08:39.98]Can I take a dump?
[08:40.66]No.
[08:40.72]Alright, so I got these sleeping pills.
[08:42.84]I'm gonna put the sleeping pills in the drink.
[08:51.16]Guy's gonna fall asleep and I'm gonna take his money, his wallet, and the keycard.
[08:54.96]Statue bust.
[08:56.70]Take the statue.
[08:57.58]I don't want to use this right now.
[09:03.03]In fact, I gotta let go of this.
[09:04.73]Let's head back downstairs.
[09:09.69]This door requires a keycard?
[09:11.03]What?
[09:11.31]Oh no!
[09:12.72]Did that guy have one on him?
[09:14.86]Oh, damn it!
[09:16.46]That asshole down over here has a keycard, I think.
[09:20.95]Hey, where did I dump your body?
[09:22.55]Oh, in here.
[09:22.97]Hey, excuse me, sir.
[09:23.79]Do you have a card?
[09:24.54]I can... No, I don't want to get in with this guy.
[09:26.34]This is weird.
[09:29.04]No, I don't want to do that.
[09:32.64]Oh, crap.
[09:33.22]How am I going to get... Oh, no, no, no.
[09:35.44]I can go downstairs.
[09:36.18]I actually came from down here.
[09:37.20]What am I doing here?
[09:37.88]Okay.
[09:39.32]I got to let go of this stupid statue.
[09:40.90]Alright, good.
[09:45.44]I want to holster that.
[09:47.47]Good, good, good, good, good.
[09:49.33]Alright.
[09:49.85]Where's your coffee?
[09:51.93]Oh, jeez.
[09:52.75]I'm bumping into stuff.
[09:56.15]Hey, how's your coffee, sir?
[09:58.33]Let me just... Can I talk to you about maybe a raise?
[10:01.59]Maybe some type of situation where you and I can discuss my money?
[10:06.09]Maybe that would be a good thing.
[10:07.39]Yeah, turn around.
[10:08.37]Turn around.
[10:09.05]Turn around.
[10:10.07]Oh, turn around.
[10:11.31]Don't worry.
[10:11.99]Don't worry about a thing.
[10:13.95]Don't worry about it.
[10:14.49]Come drink your coffee!
[10:16.29]Hey.
[10:16.51]Don't drink your damn coffee!
[10:18.71]What?
[10:18.87]I'm gonna just smash this guy, I think.
[10:20.03]Let's see.
[10:20.25]Is he gonna drink his coffee again?
[10:21.31]Please go back to your coffee.
[10:23.40]There he goes.
[10:44.52]There he goes.
[10:45.12]That's right.
[10:45.70]Go drink the coffee.
[10:47.48]Coffee is good.
[10:50.66]Oh, you don't even know.
[10:51.54]I'm just like, no, nothing.
[10:52.54]Just itching my nose here.
[10:54.34]Don't worry about anything.
[10:56.85]How's that coffee?
[10:58.29]I bet you it's good.
[10:59.17]Where are you going?
[11:04.57]Is he going to go like diarrhea?
[11:06.03]I hope so.
[11:16.01]Yeah.
[11:16.73]No, I'm gonna make sure he gets out okay, fellas.
[11:19.57]Don't mind me.
[11:20.15]I'm just gonna follow him over here.
[11:21.91]Oh, wait.
[11:23.75]Oh, it just did.
[11:24.93]How you guys doing?
[11:27.69]Hello there, men.
[11:28.89]How are you?
[11:30.05]Good to see you.
[11:31.05]Yeah, I'm a fellow recruit.
[11:32.13]Yep, yep, yep.
[11:32.79]Okay.
[11:34.93]Oh, boy.
[11:35.29]That guy is not liking this at all.
[11:40.23]Oh, I'm out of instinct.
[11:41.01]I can't, like, fool him.
[11:42.49]Let me just read a book.
[11:47.89]Oh, nice!
[11:48.44]It worked!
[11:48.76]Alright, give me your stuff.
[11:51.90]Give me the keycard.
[11:53.38]Give me your pistol.
[11:54.42]Alright.
[11:57.42]Alright, good, good, good.
[11:58.22]I got the keycard.
[11:58.88]Alright, we're doing good here.
[12:06.19]Why did I do that?
[12:08.67]That was completely unnecessary.
[12:10.87]I just, like, lost points because of that.
[12:14.23]Goddammit, why am I such a freak?
[12:17.58]I couldn't, like... Oh, well, let's just go.
[12:20.38]Why do I have to kill that guy?
[12:26.49]What?
[12:27.83]Oh!
[12:28.79]Now you tell me that!
[12:30.77]Oh, by the way, if you do really well and don't kill everybody, you get more moves.
[12:34.57]Thanks for letting me know.
[12:36.37]I could have used that advice, like, 30 seconds ago, before I shot that guy in his face.
[12:43.15]Let's go.
[12:44.91]Entrance located.
[12:46.68]Alright.
[12:48.54]Now what?
[12:50.80]Closing in on target.
[12:52.84]Closing in on target.
[12:53.80]Oh, she's right there.
[12:55.17]Hmm.
[13:10.21]So, do I gotta... Oh, I'm gonna see some inner conflict here, guys.
[13:13.95]Do I kill her, or do I not kill her?
[13:16.99]She's right through this door.
[13:19.64]Should I just open the door?
[13:21.80]I guess so.
[13:22.74]Cutscene!
[13:23.86]Oh boy!
[13:24.88]Censored!
[13:25.82]This is where we censor a bunch of stuff.
[13:34.39]Hello, Diana.
[13:36.73]Glad to see you're taking a shower.
[13:39.62]Fully closed, by the way.
[13:40.96]Oh, and he does it.
[13:48.46]Oh.
[13:56.53]I killed her.
[14:00.69]Wait a minute.
[14:01.49]Get to Victoria.
[14:03.62]What is going on here?
[14:07.00]Oh, does it?
[14:10.12]That's good to know.
[14:13.98]My guns are just out.
[14:15.30]Dude, sun's out, guns out.
[14:18.68]Okay, let's go.
[14:20.28]I think I'm going to have to go in a blaze of glory here, guys.
[14:23.53]I don't think they want me to be stealthy here.
[14:25.17]Can he?
[14:25.31]Hmm.
[14:36.04]Really?
[14:39.65]Hold control for instinct.
[14:42.17]Press Q to activate point shooting.
[14:44.59]Wait, what?
[14:45.07]Place a tag?
[14:45.53]Oh dear goodness.
[14:57.95]This is some Fallout 3 garbage right here.
[15:03.53]Dude, that was... That was sick!
[15:07.12]Why haven't I... I should have just done that to the whole room down here.
[15:11.32]Oh wow, that was cool.
[15:12.96]That was really cool.
[15:16.02]I just killed four dudes in one second.
[15:19.21]Hell freakin' yeah!
[15:22.41]Oh, so this is like the daughter or something?
[15:24.55]I have no idea.
[15:27.63]Don't worry.
[15:28.13]You can come with me.
[15:28.97]I will protect you.
[15:29.79]I'm 47.
[15:31.39]Good to meet you.
[15:32.89]You know who I am.
[15:33.95]Sonny in here.
[15:35.55]I know.
[15:39.91]His mouth just moved and he didn't talk.
[15:41.02]What was that?
[15:41.56]She's dead, isn't she?
[15:44.90]Come on.
[15:45.40]Stay close to me.
[15:46.40]Where are we going?
[15:49.18]We're going to bring you to somewhere safe.
[15:53.26]Bitch.
[15:55.79]Alright.
[15:57.45]Unlocked.
[15:57.83]Reduce recoil when firing weapons.
[16:00.73]Ooh.
[16:03.57]Not too bad.
[16:04.53]I mean, I got spotted once.
[16:06.69]I killed a civilian, apparently.
[16:08.35]I killed three dudes.
[16:11.19]Well, it made me kill three guys, didn't it?
[16:14.39]Complete objective.
[16:15.41]Body hidden.
[16:17.01]Evidence removed.
[16:17.67]Silent kill.
[16:18.26]Headshot.
[16:19.96]I did okay.
[16:21.22]I mean, not fantastic, but for a blind run.
[16:23.98]Okay, cool, cool, cool.
[16:27.15]Alright, well, I guess that concludes episode one of this quasi-playthrough of Hitman Absolution.
[16:34.88]Stay tuned for episode two when me and this weird girl go solve crimes together.
[16:39.66]I don't even know.
[16:40.48]But I'll see you guys all soon.
[16:41.70]Stay tuned for the next episode and take care, everybody.
