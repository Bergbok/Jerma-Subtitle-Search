[00:08.72]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.48]Jerma here with Nightmare House 1.
[00:13.50]It's the actual prologue to Nightmare House 2.
[00:16.94]And I did it sort of in reverse.
[00:18.71]I did Nightmare House 2 before I did Nightmare House 1.
[00:22.45]And that's my mistake, but I did promise I was going to do this.
[00:25.75]I did promise I was going to do the prologue.
[00:27.63]So let's wrap up Nightmare House 2, the playthrough, totally, I guess, with Nightmare House 1.
[00:33.43]Prologue.
[00:34.39]Here we go.
[00:36.03]I heard this is very, very scary.
[00:37.49]I heard there's a lot of moments in the prologue or in Nightmare House 1.
[00:42.44]Where you crap your pants.
[00:44.34]So let's see if I crap my pants.
[00:48.06]Currently at the loading screen.
[00:51.88]Uh-oh.
[00:57.03]Nightmare House 2 will start after finishing the prologue.
[01:02.01]Okay.
[01:02.31]Okay.
[01:04.28]This is gonna be real scary.
[01:05.92]Alright.
[01:11.49]The prologue.
[01:12.47]Oh, man.
[01:15.23]Oh, boy.
[01:18.51]Birds.
[01:20.39]This is very dark.
[01:21.27]I might turn up the brightness just a little bit, because I can't see anything.
[01:27.80]Brightness.
[01:30.60]Right there should be better.
[01:35.40]hey it's still pretty dark but a little bit better let's just go here in the woods over the hills and through the woods to grandmother's house we go look at that house it's a nightmare house okay blood at the door
[02:02.08]Anything around here?
[02:03.14]Bottle.
[02:04.48]Get out of here.
[02:05.58]Table.
[02:05.98]You know what?
[02:06.26]Let's wreck this guy's whole picnic table.
[02:08.06]That's all I can do.
[02:10.32]Get out of the way.
[02:11.20]Can I open this up?
[02:12.06]No.
[02:14.93]Door will not open.
[02:15.95]That's okay.
[02:22.85]Whoever lives here, you are a freak.
[02:25.35]What's that?
[02:28.05]A bulkhead?
[02:28.59]Can I open the bulkhead?
[02:30.79]No, it's locked.
[02:32.31]I can't do anything with this house.
[02:33.99]This nightmare house.
[02:35.15]Let's, uh... Can I go around?
[02:36.71]Hmm... Maybe there's a way to break it?
[02:40.81]Can I, like, break that?
[02:42.61]With a shovel or something?
[02:45.34]Break it!
[02:46.06]Open the doors and smash the window.
[02:47.44]Ooh, smash the window.
[02:48.48]Smash the window.
[02:48.98]Give me something to smash the window with.
[02:52.12]Oh!
[02:54.64]Oh, that's not gonna work.
[02:55.52]I can see inside, but I cannot get in.
[03:00.46]Hmm.
[03:02.80]Come with me.
[03:04.24]What about the shed?
[03:05.64]Let's go check out the shanty.
[03:09.39]Anything?
[03:11.19]Hey, the shed opens.
[03:12.15]There's an axe.
[03:15.65]A bike.
[03:20.03]I'm gonna ride my bike out of here.
[03:22.33]Give me the axe.
[03:24.00]Why can't I take the table saw?
[03:25.12]I'd rather have the table saw.
[03:30.34]I could probably just break the door down now.
[03:32.42]Actually, you know what?
[03:33.38]I'm gonna go for the lock.
[03:34.66]Lock seems like the sure thing.
[03:38.71]And... Yay!
[03:40.33]Door!
[03:44.79]Hello?
[03:45.15]Hey!
[03:50.90]Do I have a flashlight?
[03:52.18]Okay, good to know that you have a flashlight in this one as well as the second one.
[03:55.52]Good to know.
[03:56.94]Let's move along here.
[04:00.95]Electric.
[04:02.39]I'm assuming I'm gonna get hurt if I touch that.
[04:03.89]Go!
[04:04.65]Nope.
[04:05.59]Oh, it's all water.
[04:07.91]I'm gonna electrocute if I stand on that.
[04:11.25]Jump!
[04:13.05]Alright, let's go tub.
[04:14.63]Let's go move the tub.
[04:18.54]Hey, dude.
[04:22.64]Are you okay?
[04:24.44]Are you okay, sir?
[04:26.76]You don't look okay.
[04:30.09]Got a gun.
[04:32.97]Break some of these crates.
[04:33.91]Let's get the hell out of here.
[04:36.93]Door opens.
[04:37.71]Now this just comes back out to the electricity room.
[04:42.12]Hmm.
[04:42.98]Can I jump this?
[04:45.86]I thought the guy was gone.
[04:50.44]Move this thing.
[04:50.92]Get out of the way.
[04:53.72]Oh, I think I know what to do.
[04:55.02]I gotta make like a quasi-bridge.
[04:58.34]Ah, that didn't work.
[04:59.84]Come here.
[05:01.18]You go right here, and you get over here.
[05:05.97]And you go right here.
[05:07.31]Is that going to do it?
[05:08.41]Is that going to work?
[05:12.19]Physics, I don't know how you work.
[05:14.37]Come here.
[05:17.79]Get over here.
[05:18.77]Oh my god, maybe this is not what you're supposed to do.
[05:21.79]I can't see any other way, though, so I'm going to say yes it is.
[05:26.13]Hey, look at that.
[05:28.12]No, don't fall over.
[05:29.64]Yes, it worked.
[05:30.96]I made it.
[05:34.06]Door won't open.
[05:37.05]Of course the door won't open.
[05:39.21]Why would the door open?
[05:47.35]No, that's not the way.
[05:49.64]Secret room.
[05:50.32]Secret room.
[05:51.81]No.
[05:52.61]Where am I supposed to go?
[05:53.91]Maybe out to the back here?
[05:55.73]To the tour, maybe?
[05:57.79]I'm gonna try my block building routine again.
[06:01.84]Because I think I saw something up there.
[06:05.36]Is that gonna work?
[06:06.72]And support my weight!
[06:07.74]Yay!
[06:08.60]Oh, hooray.
[06:10.05]This is what I just looked at.
[06:12.33]What is this?
[06:14.11]Oh, hello-
[06:17.11]Guy sitting on the toilet.
[06:19.08]Is now not a guy on the toilet.
[06:21.48]It's two guys.
[06:23.62]Kind of looks like an egg.
[06:24.48]Got my flashlight still, right?
[06:27.96]Anything in here I need to know?
[06:29.28]Turn on the water.
[06:30.35]Clean my hands.
[06:32.57]No, I knew it!
[06:33.27]I knew it!
[06:33.67]I knew it!
[06:34.19]I knew you were going to do that!
[06:35.69]Why am I kneeling?
[06:36.39]I was just kneeling, like just swinging at him.
[06:39.13]Now it'll open, right?
[06:40.63]There's another one right here, no?
[06:42.62]I thought his legs were going to get up instead of attacking me.
[06:47.16]Anything in here?
[06:49.04]Bullets.
[06:51.80]Oh, this one is so scary because it's just confined rooms.
[06:57.24]It's like hallways.
[06:59.18]Storage.
[06:59.68]Can I move this?
[07:01.00]Don't think I can.
[07:03.36]Can I open this door?
[07:05.44]This door looks like it's already kind of ajar.
[07:07.04]I don't know.
[07:07.88]I don't know.
[07:12.90]Open.
[07:14.20]Can I break?
[07:15.06]Maybe I can just break this.
[07:19.02]No, I can't.
[07:20.16]That's good to know.
[07:22.52]Good to know.
[07:24.90]You got anything in your cabinets, lady?
[07:27.60]Hey!
[07:28.52]Hey!
[07:29.24]Whoa!
[07:29.86]Oh, I thought someone broke in the door.
[07:31.46]Okay, the lights out.
[07:33.44]Lights out.
[07:35.62]It's curfew.
[07:39.28]Mm-hmm.
[07:42.86]Blood.
[07:43.68]Recharge flashlight.
[07:45.10]Lots of blood.
[07:46.18]Lots of blood.
[07:46.98]Lots of blood.
[07:51.33]Get the hell away from me, you son of a sneaky snake!
[07:56.48]Get away from me!
[08:01.34]TV.
[08:02.74]What's on the TV?
[08:03.52]Anything interesting?
[08:04.12]Come on, I wanna... Oh, that eye just looked at me.
[08:09.56]I wanna watch, like, SpongeBob SquarePants.
[08:12.44]Do you got that on your TV?
[08:13.52]Do you have cable?
[08:16.54]Alright, we're gonna go... I'm gonna go in here to pick... There's probably stuff in here.
[08:20.97]There is a... What the hell is this thing?
[08:23.83]This is like an incubator.
[08:24.85]Are you making, like, chickens?
[08:25.81]Are you gonna hatch, like, little chickens?
[08:28.41]Bullets.
[08:30.29]Good to have bullets.
[08:31.15]It's always good to have bullets.
[08:35.05]This is the only way to go, is in here.
[08:36.75]Let's go.
[08:40.49]Come on, now!
[08:41.05]Come on, don't do this to me!
[08:45.61]Charge the light.
[08:48.15]Hey!
[08:54.22]Where am I?
[08:56.78]Where the hell am I?
[08:58.96]What is going on?
[09:02.14]Hey, weird house you got here, dude.
[09:05.92]Your house is like a bunch of bricks.
[09:08.48]I fell down.
[09:09.30]Alright, well, let's just do it again.
[09:14.29]We're right here.
[09:15.09]That's cool.
[09:17.27]Land on... I'm stuck, I'm stuck!
[09:20.47]Why am I stuck?
[09:21.59]You, get out of my face!
[09:23.87]Thank you for getting out of my face, I appreciate that.
[09:27.93]Now why could I not land on that?
[09:29.09]Did I mess something up?
[09:29.89]Let's see, hold on.
[09:31.79]Got a board over there.
[09:34.31]And can I just jump from here?
[09:37.30]Hey, I can!
[09:47.32]Excuse me, miss.
[09:49.58]Um... There seems to be a problem here.
[09:53.40]It looks like this guy is dead on your wall, and you're just sitting there watching TV.
[10:00.68]Oh, I don't want to walk over near her.
[10:03.64]Slow down, Sequence.
[10:04.74]What you got for me, huh?
[10:06.54]You gonna run?
[10:07.74]You gonna run?
[10:08.28]That guy's gonna chase me, Garen.
[10:09.88]Oh, she wasn't even watching TV.
[10:11.76]You... What can I... Oh!
[10:17.17]My dog is barking at me right now.
[10:18.69]Did you guys hear that?
[10:19.43]He was like, roof!
[10:22.87]Get me in!
[10:24.07]Get me out of... Why are you doing this, lady?
[10:28.14]Why are you scaring me so much?
[10:33.76]Through the next door.
[10:35.88]It's locked.
[10:36.54]Gag!
[10:37.22]Come on!
[10:38.02]She's just always standing in front of you.
[10:44.88]God!
[10:46.30]Come on!
[10:46.98]That's a two-piece!
[10:49.04]Something in my eye.
[10:49.86]Something in my nose.
[10:50.92]Something all over me.
[10:52.88]Can I break this?
[10:54.02]Give me that shotgun.
[10:55.70]Oh!
[10:56.72]Shotgun, baby!
[11:01.42]Overconfidence.
[11:02.69]I just got... What is that?
[11:10.07]Alright, I'm keeping the shotgun out.
[11:11.59]I don't care how much bull- how many bullets I waste.
[11:14.81]No one is coming near me.
[11:17.79]Charge the light.
[11:18.83]Let's go.
[11:20.73]Gah!
[11:21.47]Goodies!
[11:22.59]Double shoot, double barrel!
[11:26.08]This is just a jump mania game.
[11:29.08]Everybody just jumps in your face.
[11:32.74]Got this girl jumping in my face.
[11:35.52]These guys with like the broken necks jumping in my face.
[11:38.64]Guys on the ground.
[11:41.41]Holy hell in a handbasket.
[11:44.26]Is he dead?
[11:44.72]He's dead.
[11:46.94]Come on!
[11:49.42]Hide somebody around every corner.
[11:54.04]Keys, any keys?
[11:55.66]Hey, a key!
[11:57.50]Give it to me.
[11:59.64]I want that key.
[12:02.28]Give me that key!
[12:02.90]Hey, can I pick it up?
[12:07.70]Hey, I can pick it up.
[12:08.77]Hooray!
[12:15.25]These guys are so creepy.
[12:17.65]Just these grotesque freak shows.
[12:21.55]Let's go, key man.
[12:22.98]There we go.
[12:24.24]Open the door.
[12:25.36]Get me out of... Let me guess.
[12:26.70]The stairs are gonna fall down.
[12:28.14]Hooray!
[12:29.26]No, they didn't.
[12:36.64]Oh, it opened.
[12:37.76]Where's my shotgun?
[12:39.16]I'm only comfortable when I have the shotgun out.
[12:42.66]Charge the light.
[12:46.25]Another door.
[12:48.09]Open.
[12:48.59]Get me out of here.
[12:51.11]God, this is gruesome.
[12:55.49]Oh, you're moving.
[12:56.19]You're rocking.
[12:56.77]That's not terrifying.
[12:59.84]Hey!
[13:02.22]Oh!
[13:03.82]Get me out of that room!
[13:05.34]Get me out of that room!
[13:07.04]Get me out of here!
[13:12.30]I just keep hearing noises.
[13:13.68]Get me out.
[13:15.49]Get away from me, you crawling... What's in there?
[13:20.79]Nothing?
[13:21.39]Nothing.
[13:21.83]Gotta go in here.
[13:23.37]I'm okay with that.
[13:26.33]Break down the walls.
[13:27.47]Break them down.
[13:29.87]It's gonna be a jump.
[13:31.57]I will make this jump.
[13:32.69]Here we go.
[13:33.41]Jump, master!
[13:37.39]Bullets...
[13:39.99]And a ladder.
[13:41.89]I can't move.
[13:43.55]Can I break that stuff?
[13:45.81]Oh!
[13:46.73]I thought that was a per- I thought that chair, they'll get the- Oh, there actually was a person.
[13:49.99]Never mind.
[13:58.50]Really?
[13:58.78]Oh my- shoot him!
[14:00.36]Shoot him!
[14:04.16]Get me up off of here!
[14:06.63]Will you get off me?
[14:08.37]Why can I not get out of here?
[14:09.58]I'm, like, stuck on this ladder.
[14:14.60]I fell down.
[14:15.22]Oh, well, that was dumb.
[14:18.86]I was glitched out on the ladder.
[14:20.50]I couldn't get off.
[14:21.08]Alright, this time I'm gonna be ready for this guy that was, like, sideswiping me when I climbed up the ladder.
[14:28.19]Yeah, you're dead, bro.
[14:30.37]Let's go.
[14:31.99]Get off me.
[14:34.41]Hey, my whole job is to sit up here and... I almost just got scared again from that.
[14:38.30]Get outta here!
[14:39.14]Okay, go.
[14:42.86]Okay, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[14:44.76]Load up that shotgun.
[14:46.44]Open the door.
[14:48.60]Something's gonna break through the walls!
[14:50.32]Something's gonna break through the walls!
[14:53.58]Just run everywhere.
[14:58.97]Too many.
[14:59.81]Too many.
[15:00.21]No more shotgun bolts.
[15:03.61]Should I go down?
[15:04.33]What's... What was in the room across the hall?
[15:06.44]Might as well look.
[15:09.74]It's barred up.
[15:10.68]Can't get in there.
[15:12.08]Only one option.
[15:14.60]Looks like we're gonna have to take it.
[15:16.72]Down.
[15:18.15]Going down, down, down.
[15:23.75]Get it!
[15:27.13]Oh!
[15:27.87]That one hurt.
[15:29.66]That one hurt my brain.
[15:31.89]That- and that one- DAMMIT!
[15:35.45]I thought I got better at these scare games.
[15:37.61]I got worse!
[15:38.27]Hey, come over here like Quasimodo.
[15:48.33]Eat that.
[15:49.51]Eat that!
[15:53.53]I only have two shots in this.
[15:54.79]Not anymore.
[15:56.37]Twenty now.
[15:58.88]We're good.
[16:00.70]Charge it.
[16:02.80]You have to do that.
[16:03.64]She has to just appear randomly.
[16:05.07]Did I, like, escape the house?
[16:06.27]I think I did.
[16:09.15]Get me out of here.
[16:10.33]Take me down, like, the King's Road.
[16:12.69]Game of Thrones reference.
[16:14.01]That was a Game of Thrones reference.
[16:16.27]Who's gonna come at me and get shot in the face with the shotgun?
[16:19.47]A lot of people here.
[16:20.75]What's going on?
[16:21.35]Maybe I should just be running.
[16:23.87]Oh, I have a sprint.
[16:24.95]Forgot about that.
[16:26.91]Oh my god, look!
[16:27.82]It's a light!
[16:29.62]Hey, it's a truck!
[16:32.47]Ah!
[16:36.41]You can't escape from Nightmare House.
[16:41.23]Oh my god.
[16:42.75]Well, that's it, I guess, for Nightmare House 1.
[16:49.18]Now, if you're watching this right now and you didn't see any of the Nightmare House 2 stuff, I'm going to put a link in the description to start off at Chapter 1 for Nightmare House 2.
[16:58.91]I suggest you watch through that playthrough.
[17:00.33]It was very, very fun, very, very interesting.
[17:03.18]And yeah, that's going to wrap it up, guys.
[17:04.62]I will see you guys all soon.
[17:06.20]And take care, everybody.
