[01:40.90]Hold on for dear life.
[01:42.80]We're going over the goddamn ramp.
[01:44.24]That's not what I wanted to have happen.
[01:46.42]For some how I landed that.
[01:48.88]Broken bones everywhere.
[01:50.00]I don't know how that just happened.

[02:00.04]Go!
[02:05.24]And just like that, he was never heard from again.
[02:08.71]So, are you sure this is safe?
[02:14.23]I'm positive.
[02:14.83]Just do it, you baby!
[02:16.87]Okay, well, I guess I'll try.
[02:18.29]Weeeeeee!
[02:22.94]Looks like you're gonna be fighting a little bit of construction on Route 24 coming on the bridge there.
[02:27.30]What the fuck even happened?
[02:29.50]Are you serious?
[02:32.51]I didn't even do anything!
[02:34.23]He didn't do anything!
[02:36.21]What just happened?
[02:42.87]Broke my neck on the dashboard.
[02:46.07]Okay, okay.
[02:50.61]You know, son, it was on this very bridge that your mother proposed to me.
[02:55.15]I mean, I proposed to your mother.
[02:57.71]She looked so pretty in her red dress that day.
[03:00.51]Fucking come on!
[03:02.09]Did I ever tell you, son, when I proposed to your mother on this very bridge?
[03:07.82]We were both young and restless.
[03:10.24]And I said, sweetie, I love you so much.
[03:12.80]Can we please get married?
[03:14.42]And if I miss this again, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[03:18.44]It was this very bridge where I proposed to your mother.
[03:23.17]She looked so pretty in her red dress.
[03:25.29]And I said, I said, son, would you like to get married?
[03:30.81]Oh, there's a fire.
[03:31.79]There's a fire somewhere.
[03:33.13]We're gonna bring the fire engine.
[03:34.47]I think there's a fire.
[03:35.61]There could be a fire over here.
[03:37.37]It's this highway right here.
[03:38.45]This is the one, son.
[03:39.19]You gotta be careful.
[03:39.93]You're only a student driver.
[03:41.49]You gotta watch out for the goddamn animals.
[03:43.27]There's birds and bears cross this bridge all the time.
[03:46.66]So please just be careful.
[03:48.62]Look out, son!
[03:49.42]There goes one now!
[03:50.52]You're right.
[03:55.81]Why did Mummy not want me to play in the street?
[03:58.91]She said not to play in the street, but why?
[04:00.87]It's so much fun.
[04:07.61]Fuck!
[04:08.09]That would have been perfect!
[04:10.47]I can't wait to show my mummy my new skateboard move.
[04:13.61]She told me not to play in the street, but I don't care.
[04:15.66]Mummy, you know she... Maybe I could show Mummy my new skateboard move.
[04:20.86]Look, I'm flying down like Superman.
[04:28.33]Check it out, yo, I'm going for 20 points!
[04:33.89]20 points.
[04:36.59]Yeah, my boyfriend's so badass.
[04:39.07]He's in a biker gang.
[04:40.91]He buys me presents all the time.
[04:42.99]You wish you had a boyfriend like mine.
[04:44.64]Just wait till he shows up to say, to say fuck you.
[04:47.50]And he fucking fell off again.
[04:48.58]I really hope this works.
[04:52.22]I've done this like eight times and he keeps on falling off the bike like a dipshit.
[04:56.60]Somebody get this dipshit a driver's license that is capable for a motorcycle.
[05:00.55]Here he comes.
[05:01.31]Here he comes.
[05:02.05]Come on.
[05:02.79]Come on now.
[05:06.55]You did it.
[05:07.95]You did it, my son.
