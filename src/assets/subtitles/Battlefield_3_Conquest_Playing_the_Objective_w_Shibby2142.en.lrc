[00:06.99]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:09.71]Jerma here with a Battlefield 3 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.63]Only the second Battlefield 3 video on this channel, and I'm going to try and change that.
[00:18.07]I'm trying to get better at this game, trying to find my groove playing with Shibby2142 and a couple other guys.
[00:24.80]They helped me out.
[00:25.56]They were pretty good seasoned veterans at this game.
[00:28.16]So enjoy the live commentary, guys, starting right now.
[00:36.42]Oh, no.
[00:36.90]Oh, that's a bad idea.
[00:39.58]Whoa, hey, he just went right by me.
[00:43.29]I'm cool with that.
[00:43.93]Oh, where's this guy?
[00:48.73]All right, everyone join Charlie.
[00:51.89]Wait, can Hans just, like, kick this person?
[00:54.27]Yeah, I can just kick.
[00:55.13]Oh, okay.
[00:55.37]Because I don't like him anyways.
[00:57.21]How did I not get that guy?
[00:58.70]One second.
[00:59.08]Oh, he just died.
[01:03.24]Jeremy, watch it around the corner.
[01:04.26]Yeah, I got him.
[01:09.06]One more.
[01:09.74]Oh, Jesus.
[01:10.54]Join up, Chips.
[01:11.10]Oh, my God.
[01:11.60]He's trying to knife me.
[01:12.34]Nice, dude.
[01:13.64]That was nice.
[01:15.07]Thank you for just saving my life.
[01:19.31]Anybody else?
[01:21.25]No, I think that's it.
[01:23.45]Oh, no.
[01:23.79]Sorry.
[01:23.91]There's somebody.
[01:24.39]Oh, no.
[01:24.85]There's an AA.
[01:26.23]He's, like, on the opposite side of two walls.
[01:28.55]Oh, God.
[01:29.05]No, he got me.
[01:29.85]So far away.
[01:30.57]He got me.
[01:34.01]There's another guy though, his buddy.
[01:41.28]Got health back, get back up, get some health.
[01:42.88]I'm down.
[01:43.40]Can I revive you?
[01:45.50]Yeah, we traded so he's dead.
[01:47.56]I can't revive you.
[01:49.18]Oh, I'm dead dead?
[01:49.86]Yeah.
[01:52.48]The green meanie.
[01:53.91]Like the green monster.
[01:55.69]The German knows all about that.
[01:59.17]Oh, come on.
[01:59.61]What do you know about suppressing fire right there?
[02:05.32]don't like y'all got that unit is that we look at the helicopter it telecopter heights I tried to come in and just like fling them with a helicopter and I don't know I got to get I have no able left about I have absolutely no m o left like others it's a helicopter off the carpet the sun is so bright to bring up
[02:33.96]Like, notify that the building's falling.
[02:36.26]Yeah, that's probably the rarest way to die in this game is by destruction because, you know, Frostbite 2, so much destruction, guys.
[02:44.28]Less destruction than Bad Company 2.
[02:46.04]It makes sense, right?
[02:46.94]Destruction.
[02:48.61]Yeah, so getting killed by destruction, that's like an honor.
[02:52.55]Oh, boy.
[02:53.77]Oh, God.
[02:54.43]That's helicopter.
[02:55.23]Hit the helicopter face-on with a rocket.
[02:58.69]What do I get?
[02:59.71]Nothing.
[03:00.51]Nothing from it.
[03:01.75]Nope.
[03:02.33]Nope.
[03:03.51]Alright, let's take B, A is also getting capped.
[03:06.48]Coming right behind you, Shibby.
[03:07.82]Alright.
[03:08.14]No pants, why you be dying?
[03:09.98]Because I'm trying to take out Hellermann Choppers with rockets and it doesn't work.
[03:12.90]Behind you, Shibby.
[03:14.98]Yep, two of them.
[03:15.84]Oh, damn it.
[03:16.40]I got killed.
[03:17.50]I don't even know where he was.
[03:18.28]Working on him.
[03:21.08]Got one.
[03:21.70]Nice, I just saw that.
[03:22.60]There you go.
[03:25.85]Ooh, with the revive.
[03:27.61]Clutch.
[03:29.79]Not a lot of people do that.
[03:30.93]Kids switch revive.
[03:33.46]It's a roll.
[03:34.76]Okay, A's clean, B's clean, C's clean.
[03:37.54]Wait.
[03:38.24]C's flashing.
[03:38.74]Let's go.
[03:38.94]Alright.
[03:40.34]Why did I do that?
[03:41.15]Why did I do that?
[03:41.83]Hold on my chopper.
[03:42.91]He's on the roof.
[03:45.75]Fuck.
[03:46.91]Oh, eat this.
[03:48.55]Eat this, baby.
[03:49.43]Alright, let's go.
[03:52.01]Vote next map.
[03:53.59]Yeah, you can vote for the next map here.
[03:55.53]Oh, I got your RPG.
[03:56.85]Got him.
[04:03.02]Grandpa saw.
[04:05.68]Got this.
[04:07.72]We got this.
[04:08.54]Where are we going?
[04:11.24]I don't know.
[04:11.78]I accidentally pushed E out of the helicopter.
[04:14.14]I like this scope you got.
[04:20.15]This thing's good.
[04:20.69]I like this little... The cobra.
[04:26.25]That's considered one of the red dots and then there's the red dot red dot which is the American version.
[04:30.69]Why are we going to E?
[04:31.67]I'm from us.
[04:32.11]I'm from us.
[04:33.99]Got him.
[04:36.26]Where did he spawn from?
[04:37.36]I don't know.
[04:38.00]Let's just go take A. If you want to go on foot.
[04:40.08]Yeah, I'm coming with you.
[04:41.42]Alright, I'm going to take this corner right here.
[04:45.98]Oh, we're going to shout from behind.
[04:48.82]Oh my stupid little bird.
[04:50.30]I'll get him.
[04:51.41]Oh my god.
[04:52.49]I hate that.
[04:53.09]He came out of nowhere.
[04:54.95]He's like... Anybody in the building?
[04:58.03]That thing is so overpowered.
[04:59.57]Alright.
[05:00.89]Hopefully our car is still there.
[05:04.23]I kind of paid her a lot for that one.
[05:06.33]Yeah, we had valet pocket.
[05:08.75]Uh oh.
[05:10.59]Don't push E. No, it disappeared.
[05:15.57]We're going B. Guy on the road.
[05:17.78]We'll cover you.
[05:18.78]You guys are going B?
[05:21.62]We're going B, B, E, E. There's a car at B, so watch it.
[05:25.92]We're going to ram it.
[05:26.64]Jerma, it's all you.
[05:31.17]That was a poor decision.
[05:38.35]Because we were bumping the Jurassic Park tune, and I just got all jacked up.
[05:44.05]T?
[05:45.06]I did it!
[05:46.88]Am I even capping this damn thing?
[05:48.56]Here we go.
[05:51.72]Protecting it.
[05:54.36]Spawning on the T of space.
[05:56.54]Or no, little bird.
[05:58.92]Aw, yeah.
[06:00.58]Oh, we're about to win.
[06:02.24]These guys got crushed.
[06:04.10]Secured.
[06:04.74]Flag cap.
[06:07.85]Whoa.
[06:09.29]Whoa.
[06:09.61]You need some heals.
[06:10.63]You need some heals.
[06:12.31]Who's that guy?
[06:12.85]Give me a sec.
[06:14.15]Shoot him.
[06:14.51]Just shoot him.
[06:14.97]Just shoot him all.
[06:15.67]No.
[06:19.36]Your team has won.
[06:21.68]So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[06:23.86]Thank you so much for watching.
[06:25.30]I really do appreciate it.
[06:26.68]And I will see you guys all next time trying to get better at Battlefield.
[06:29.93]I promise you.
[06:31.55]See you guys all next time.
[06:32.99]Take care, everybody.
