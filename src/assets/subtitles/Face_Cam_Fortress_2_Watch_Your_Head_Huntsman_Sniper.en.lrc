[00:08.68]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.56]Jerma here with Basecamp Fortress 2.
[00:13.87]Playing on CTF Turbine.
[00:16.17]Almost forgot the name of the map.
[00:18.75]But, I did not headshot that guy.
[00:22.21]There's no way I headshot that guy.
[00:23.65]I went like three feet to the left of his head.
[00:26.15]But anyways, playing on CTF Turbine.
[00:28.12]Using the Huntsman Sniper.
[00:31.18]One of my favorite classes in the game.
[00:32.52]A lot of you guys already know that.
[00:34.16]But, let's get right into this here.
[00:36.24]Here!
[00:37.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:40.74]Ah, come on.
[00:41.54]Give me that shot in the head.
[00:44.44]Close.
[00:45.46]Close.
[00:47.16]Are we gonna get the cap?
[00:48.35]Are we gonna get the... I almost said cart.
[00:51.31]I almost said a lot of things today.
[00:53.79]You are standing still on there, and you are a spy.
[00:58.13]Welcome to the show.
[01:00.63]He's gonna backstab me.
[01:02.61]I almost just got backstabbed.
[01:04.09]Another one!
[01:05.35]What the hell?
[01:08.53]Whenever that happens, that always scares the absolute crap out of me.
[01:13.21]I get in a lot of those situations where you kill a spy or you knock a spy into Dead Ringer.
[01:19.37]And then another spy just appears in front of you like they both were coming at you at the same time.
[01:23.32]It's terrifying.
[01:25.04]So let's respawn now.
[01:27.48]We got two caps.
[01:29.32]We might just win this right off the bat.
[01:32.12]I'm okay with that.
[01:35.94]Anybody, anybody, anybody, anybody?
[01:37.56]We're gonna win right now.
[01:40.52]Ooh, I thought that was gonna be a long-range headshot.
[01:45.53]That's gonna hit him.
[01:46.09]No, it's not.
[01:47.07]But he's covered in pee, and I'm gonna get the assist.
[01:50.93]Alright, let's go again.
[01:52.27]Scramble the teams.
[01:53.01]Alright, I'm fine with that.
[01:54.81]I'm cool with that, man.
[01:57.47]Launch it.
[01:58.33]Ready?
[01:58.77]Ready?
[01:59.23]Ready?
[02:00.72]I thought he was gonna go this way.
[02:03.67]Scramble teams, here we go.
[02:06.41]You are now on blue in red letters.
[02:09.67]What?
[02:11.45]I'm on red team.
[02:13.61]I'm on red team right now.
[02:17.13]Valve, why you be trolling?
[02:21.15]Can't even get your colors right.
[02:24.99]Come out of there, come out of there.
[02:27.13]No.
[02:28.48]He's gonna be right here.
[02:31.04]Nope, that guy is though.
[02:33.49]I'll take that.
[02:35.57]Oh, spy!
[02:37.73]I'll take that as well.
[02:39.48]Pee!
[02:41.46]Pee in his face!
[02:43.36]That's a spy pyro.
[02:47.30]Ah, if I had aimed a little bit higher.
[02:50.70]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, whoa.
[02:54.84]We got it, we got it, we got it.
[02:57.58]Oh, get his head!
[03:01.47]I'm just trying to... I will get this guy.
[03:03.91]I will get this guy in his face.
[03:07.92]Yes, I got him!
[03:10.20]And that guy... Oh my god, crits.
[03:12.14]Oh my god, crits!
[03:14.74]Ooh, it's always so nerve-wracking.
[03:16.26]That guy's still pinned to the wall up there.
[03:17.92]Oh my goodness gracious.
[03:19.62]Is the medic still up here?
[03:20.95]Pyro's right here.
[03:23.15]This Pyro is gonna get it right in his... Oh, man!
[03:27.95]Oh, man!
[03:30.13]That was not good for him.
[03:31.80]Oh!
[03:33.16]Oh, you wanna play this game?
[03:34.60]Let's go.
[03:36.58]Wow!
[03:37.14]Wow!
[03:38.06]Wow!
[03:40.30]Awesome one.
[03:41.70]That was awesome.
[03:42.94]I give you props for that one.
[03:44.12]You waited that one out, you played for it, and you got the kill.
[03:48.16]So if you're watching this right now, awesome one, good kill.
[03:51.95]Oh my god.
[03:54.59]There's nothing in this cup!
[03:57.45]There should be Dr. Pepper in there.
[03:59.21]Damn it!
[04:01.12]Heavy is going to cap it.
[04:02.51]Abso-positively, my friend.
[04:04.47]Headshot right off the bat.
[04:11.21]No.
[04:12.97]I will crit you.
[04:14.37]Come here, you little scout.
[04:18.31]Oh, bam.
[04:20.47]My god.
[04:21.39]I could have never prayed for a shot that good.
[04:26.12]Holy crap.
[04:28.68]It's on tonight.
[04:33.29]There's a sentry.
[04:34.37]Oi!
[04:35.85]Can I take that thing out from out here?
[04:42.73]I had it.
[04:44.29]I had it.
[04:44.67]That's a lot of deaths so far.
[04:46.24]I kind of just keep getting myself killed.
[04:50.28]Sir, you've got a scout right next to you.
[04:53.06]Is he going to do it?
[04:53.54]Is he going to do it?
[04:54.56]Place your bets.
[04:55.06]Place your bets.
[04:55.48]Who's going to win this fight?
[04:58.55]Was there a spy behind him?
[05:00.61]I just don't know.
[05:02.25]You can never know in Team Fortress 2.
[05:07.33]That should have hit him.
[05:08.47]I should have not... Just come here for crying out loud.
[05:13.61]Oh, you... I'm gonna... Whatever.
[05:15.13]I'll kill him right now.
[05:16.09]Ready?
[05:16.51]Ready?
[05:17.45]Damn!
[05:18.41]This guy's being a weasel.
[05:20.57]Oh my... Oh, I'm so bad.
[05:23.59]I am so bad.
[05:27.88]I wonder how many misses were that, like seven in a row?
[05:31.40]Good game.
[05:32.02]Let's cap this last one.
[05:34.19]This heavy is so toast.
[05:36.57]There it is!
[05:38.61]Heavy, I'm not gonna kill you.
[05:40.39]We're gonna have a tea party in here.
[05:41.73]Wait, just come here!
[05:43.25]Let's do one more for good measure here.
[05:46.84]Walk into that.
[05:47.66]No, you didn't walk into it!
[05:50.92]How did you not get shot in your face?
[05:53.34]This guy's so dead.
[05:55.20]Wow, there's a lot of you in there!
[05:56.40]Wow Pyro!
[05:58.31]Oh my god!
[05:59.27]I gotta get myself out.
[06:00.19]Put me out, please!
[06:00.97]Put me out, please!
[06:01.91]Please, sir!
[06:02.55]Thank you so much, I love you.
[06:06.39]Demoman is this guy's name.
[06:08.14]I should probably be getting health right now, but... Damn it.
[06:15.66]Oh, somebody would've just got wrecked.
[06:20.70]Wow!
[06:21.24]But get me back in!
[06:22.16]Get me back in here, please!
[06:23.11]I need health!
[06:28.33]Please, is there a medic on the team or anything?
[06:30.57]That's two in a row!
[06:33.19]Are we gonna just win this right off the bat?
[06:37.17]Come on, health.
[06:39.69]Wow, that's, there's gonna be three caps literally in a row.
[06:45.19]Alrighty then.
[06:48.73]Bang!
[06:51.19]I should've hit him.
[06:51.92]I'll get this Demoman though.
[06:55.25]Oh, we turned into it.
[06:57.87]Well, that's... That's three.
[07:01.02]Can I get this pyro?
[07:01.88]Is the real question?
[07:02.78]Yes, I can.
[07:04.30]Well, that's just three just bang, bang, bang, bang caps in a row.
[07:08.08]I guess I'll just end with that.
[07:09.36]So, thanks so much for watching, guys.
[07:11.52]I really do appreciate it.
[07:12.88]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[07:14.22]And, of course, take care, everybody.
[07:16.76]Trying to get that into the microphone.
[07:18.12]Hopefully it did.
