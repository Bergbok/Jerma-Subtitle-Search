[00:09.69]Like, seriously.
[00:12.45]My guy right now looks like a rubber mask.
[00:16.89]He looks like he's wearing a Halloween mask.
[00:20.82]Who's that guy?
[00:23.60]It's a big fat guy.
[00:27.97]What?
[00:31.39]I d- I d- Wait, no, no, I just, I dropped in the water.
[00:35.47]You're telling me that like I, what am I, made out of cinder blocks and I just sank to the bottom of the ocean?
[00:41.11]That wasn't that far of a jump.
[00:43.39]I feel like I've jumped in water way higher than that and it was totally fine.
[00:47.04]Are you, are you shitting me right now?
[00:49.72]No, no, no, you just sank to the bottom.
[00:51.48]Your character weighs 15,000 pounds.
[00:56.75]What is wrong with me?
[01:00.27]Alright, now I'm like a shredder.
[01:02.53]I just turned into the shredder from Ninja Turtles.
[01:04.86]This is awesome.
[01:05.52]Best game ever made.
[01:09.04]Praise the sun.
[01:09.92]By the way, are you ready?
[01:11.14]Apparently, I guess something's happening up here.
[01:14.16]Bright spot ahead.
[01:16.38]Look out.
[01:18.97]Be wary of gorgeous view.
[01:20.85]Okay, alright.
[01:22.55]Light ahead.
[01:24.98]Hurrah for gorgeous view, but be wary of hope.
[01:28.26]Are these fortune cookies?
[01:29.58]I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing, and I'm gonna get the kill.
[01:37.71]Okay, one of your cronies is behind me now.
[01:39.51]This is not good.
[01:41.51]Now I got two of you assholes to deal with.
[01:44.70]You're gonna fuck this up for me.
[01:48.94]Holy hell!
[01:55.42]This is taking so long.
[01:58.71]Welcome to Dark Souls 2.
[01:59.75]The hardest game ever!
[02:03.97]Bang.
[02:04.73]See you later.
[02:05.99]See you later.
[02:06.61]Where's my money?
[02:08.19]Where's my cash?
[02:10.39]Night sword.
[02:11.51]I got a night sword.
[02:16.41]I did it.
[02:18.21]I completed it.
[02:19.49]I killed the boss.
[02:20.97]And here's the boss.
[02:22.23]Oh!
[02:23.81]Oh!
[02:24.43]Oh!
[02:25.01]Oh!
[02:25.83]No!
[02:26.37]No, don't die!
[02:27.31]I can't die here.
[02:30.03]I seriously cannot die here.
[02:31.16]How do I climb down?
[02:34.32]I was singing the fucking boss song.
[02:37.12]Don't freak out.
[02:38.08]Don't freak out.
[02:39.54]Don't freak out.
[02:40.72]Okay.
[02:41.58]Chill.
[02:42.58]Chill.
[02:44.11]Oh, my brain.
[02:47.99]This is my shield?
[02:50.63]This is the shield I just put on?
[02:53.71]This isn't gonna block a sword!
[02:54.91]This is not gonna block a sword!
[02:57.08]Are you fucking serious?!
[03:04.38]It's just a little baby shield.
[03:08.97]Screw you.
[03:12.05]Look, ready?
[03:14.41]My baby shield is better than your giant sword!
[03:16.61]Walk onto him, you dingus.
[03:23.88]Come on.
[03:25.14]Yeah.
[03:25.80]You don't get a baby shield.
[03:27.16]Protecting your ass.
[03:32.51]Gah.
[03:36.45]Baby shield.
[03:37.33]What an unbelievable item.
[03:41.27]Seriously.
[03:42.51]You think you could fuck with the baby shield?
[03:45.89]You know, I could make the joke right now.
[03:47.93]I really could do it.
[03:49.55]And I think I'm going to.
[03:51.43]I've been saying I look like the Shredder this whole time.
[03:54.04]Well, this is legit a fat Ninja Turtle.
[03:57.38]We're about to see the epic showdown between huge, fat Michelangelo, who really let himself go eating too many pizzas with pepperoni.
[04:04.95]And, holy God, he almost just insta-killed me.
[04:08.77]Hopefully he doesn't do that!
[04:16.14]Well, this is an interesting fight.
[04:17.31]Kind of, like, who falls off first.
[04:21.97]Can I push him off?
[04:22.59]Are you seriously kidding me right now?
[04:26.99]Let's see how you died.
[04:30.30]That's a pretty big sword.
[04:32.82]Of course he did!
[04:34.12]Of course that's how he died!
[04:35.72]I feel for these people.
[04:38.98]What was that guy doing, though?
[04:41.79]What was that guy...
[04:46.08]Is this seriously how, like, all people die in this game?
[04:48.96]I mean, I've done it a bunch of times too, like, this is how everybody dies.
[04:54.80]Monsters don't kill you in Dark Souls, you just walk off cliffs!
[04:59.79]Got the fire arrows.
[05:01.45]His, like, butthole face cannot scare me.
[05:05.05]Think you're gonna scare me with your butthole face?
[05:07.65]Oh, geez.
[05:11.55]What is he doing?
[05:12.03]What is he doing?
[05:16.04]I didn't get hit.
[05:16.62]How did I not get hit?
[05:17.28]What a miracle.
[05:22.76]Watch out!
[05:23.04]Don't let him stop on you!
[05:26.88]Good.
[05:27.40]We're in good shape.
[05:28.48]Through the legs!
[05:29.14]Through the legs!
[05:31.82]You giant!
[05:34.17]You goddamn giant!
[05:38.21]Not that bad.
[05:38.75]Not that bad.
[05:40.11]We're okay.
[05:40.59]We're okay.
[05:42.11]Of course, when he does, like, the stupid super jump backwards, that's not okay.
[05:50.91]Fuck me!
[05:52.27]Fuck me!
[05:53.45]Drink the goddamn apple juice!
[05:56.14]Drink the apple juice!
[05:59.86]Don't let him do it again!
[06:02.78]Yeah, one, two!
[06:04.60]One more hit, one more hit.
[06:06.76]I am the Dark Souls 2 master.
[06:12.78]Soul of the Last Giant and the Soldier Key.
[06:16.69]You can thank this grandma-faced fuck for saving the day.
[06:20.81]Alright, this is gonna say... Uh... Up?
[06:29.60]Up?
[06:31.68]My message to the world at this boss is... Up?
[06:37.86]He's like, yeah!
[06:38.46]Yeah, let's go!
[06:39.04]Come on, man!
[06:40.54]This guy's name is like a swear, I think.
[06:43.00]Alright, well, whatever.
[06:44.20]Let's go.
[06:44.62]Enter the mist.
[06:48.18]Alright.
[06:48.94]Let's go.
[06:54.10]He's coming for me.
[06:54.76]He's coming for me.
[06:55.66]He's doing his thing.
[06:56.64]He missed.
[07:02.41]What the hell?
[07:02.77]Are you throwing, like, spears at him?
[07:04.69]This guy, like, killed him instantly!
[07:08.83]Dude, this guy... He shot me with those!
[07:16.81]He probably thinks I'm such an idiot.
[07:22.96]He just got unloaded on me.
