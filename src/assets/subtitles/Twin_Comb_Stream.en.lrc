[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.97]all right so god let me put this down so I'm gonna give you guys a poll and we'll see uh here are your options
[00:33.62]I'll give you two options here.
[00:38.66]Uh... How long did we stream for?
[00:40.22]Like three hours?
[00:40.74]Alright, well here are your choices then for the remainder of the stream.
[00:56.04]Here you go.
[00:59.76]Take a vote of what you'd like to see.
[01:01.19]Here you go.
[01:03.44]I'm either going to finish that Blind Legend game, I'm going to do it in the background to get past where we were, or we're just going to hang out.
[01:20.07]To a politics stream?
[01:27.14]Get back in there.
[01:34.73]Comb stream.
[01:35.87]Workouts.
[01:36.45]Do you want me to do a workout stream?
[01:46.04]Get back in there, coward, or comb stream.
[01:52.44]I'm not going to do a fucking workout stream.
[02:07.83]Play a game we can see.
[02:09.63]Well, that was the game you could see.
[02:11.13]You just have to use your imagination.
[02:15.78]Alright, well, it looks like most people... Not really, though.
[02:21.32]It's still a majority, but it's not all.
[02:33.62]It looks like we'll just hang out for the remainder of the stream.
[02:37.14]I'll give you three perfect push-ups.
[02:40.65]How does that sound?
[02:49.11]Three perfect push-ups.
[02:50.88]Perfect.
[02:55.14]But that was a blind legend.
[02:57.22]I probably got really close, too.
[03:00.31]I'm saying that totally not as the girl.
[03:04.23]I'm saying I probably was right outside the door.
[03:06.47]I might rage go back in after we hang out for like 20, 30 minutes and finish it.
[03:16.12]Yeah.
[03:16.50]I mean, just take a break for a minute.
[03:18.26]Get the lights on.
[03:20.74]Okay.
[03:21.04]So here, you want some perfect, perfect pushups?
[03:24.70]Sure.
[03:25.52]I can do that.
[03:26.14]Give me a second.
[03:29.40]I mean, the ground still has, like, Nintendo Labo shit all over it, but you'll get the idea.
[03:36.68]It looks like I ate, like, a bunch of bread over here.
[03:39.52]You know, I just can't help it.
[03:40.48]I just eat bread and just, like, throw it on the ground.
[03:43.36]Ready?
[03:43.54]Want your perfect fucking push-ups?
[03:46.03]Here they are.
[03:46.41]Make sure you can see this.
[03:50.37]Can you see this?
[03:52.51]We're gonna go long ways.
[03:54.51]Okay, so form is really important when you do a push-up.
[03:57.63]Don't let anybody tell you that it's not.
[03:59.74]And people will tell you, yeah, it doesn't matter your form as long as you go up and down.
[04:03.35]So this is how you start, like this.
[04:08.43]You know, like a runner's stance.
[04:09.73]You know right before the gun goes off and you run?
[04:13.05]You want to get down like this.
[04:14.93]Just pretend like you're about to hear the bang for the gun.
[04:17.97]And then when the gun goes off, it's one.
[04:20.11]Don't let the knee touch the ground.
[04:22.41]Two.
[04:24.92]Three.
[04:26.18]And then you start sprinting.
[04:30.72]All right, watch this, motherfuckers.
[04:33.76]Watch this, motherfucker.
[04:35.76]You want three?
[04:39.48]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[04:51.09]I can't get fucking ten!
[04:55.20]Oh, buddy.
[05:04.77]Let me see.
[05:05.15]I want to see that!
[05:14.52]I'm gonna wake up so sore tomorrow because I haven't worked out in like fucking two years.
[05:23.28]Tuck your elbows or you're gonna get the whole thing.
[05:25.62]All the way down and just fucking push the whole thing.
[05:31.21]Oh, you're such an inspiration.
[05:35.51]10 push-ups.
[05:36.99]You would be surprised if you haven't done anything in a long time.
[05:40.19]All right.
[05:41.45]All right, now let's put braces on my teeth in real life.
[05:51.04]I need some metal.
[05:51.50]All right, I need to put this back.
[05:58.48]It's a rubber band thing.
[05:59.98]God damn it, this looks bad.
[06:03.87]What am I doing?
[06:04.89]The rubber band that goes on your teeth.
[06:09.19]When you get braces, you get the bands back here, they go around.
[06:11.92]Nice armpit hair.
[06:16.80]What's wrong with, what?
[06:18.84]What?
[06:20.88]You have a problem?
[06:28.94]What, I don't understand.
[06:31.09]Somebody called my hair candy floss.
[06:33.51]And I hope that person gets banned permanently from the channel.
[06:44.04]Fucking candy floss.
[06:46.36]But it said it's humid down here and I just got out of the shower.
[06:50.26]It is like that because I can't treat it with anything because I come down in this room.
[06:53.88]Here's something you guys don't understand.
[06:56.44]I come down here.
[06:58.33]And it's so hot.
[06:59.27]And it's a hotbox, humid-ass room.
[07:01.57]That this just happens.
[07:03.84]There's nothing I can do about this.
[07:09.02]See me on a good day.
[07:12.52]Whatever.
[07:12.98]Who cares?
[07:13.52]Just let it be.
[07:14.28]Let it do its dumb, fucked-up thing.
[07:16.30]Alright, so what are we doing?
[07:17.30]I gotta comb my hair, right?
[07:18.84]That's like the whole joke.
[07:26.79]This actually might help a little.
[07:32.92]No, I'm not playing GeoGuessr.
[07:35.97]I can feel it.
[07:36.65]It's so coarse and brittle.
[07:39.77]Fucking humidity.
[07:41.83]I'm about to... It's hard to speak.
[07:45.11]I'm about to go from humidity to no humidity.
[07:47.79]Which is potentially equally as bad for your hair.
[07:50.09]I'm just making it so much worse.
[07:52.29]I'm just going to leave it in there.
[07:57.84]Do a reaction stream.
[07:58.70]We already did this like a few days ago.
[08:02.35]I'm just taking a break so I can go back in to finish a Blind Legend.
[08:11.30]It's a real male model.
[08:13.70]I gotta get a blow dryer here, hold on.
[08:19.37]I almost just knocked the switch off the table.
[08:30.39]Hey, I should play WoW.
[08:31.97]Wait, hold on.
[08:32.86]Basic Farrell, hold on, $100.
[08:34.18]All right, let's do that.
[08:38.78]It don't matter.
[08:40.28]Basic Farrell, thank you for the $100.
[08:44.16]$100 from Basic Farrell.
[08:46.61]And you say, I should play WoW.
[08:50.05]Thank you, dude.
[08:52.11]Mike?
[08:52.47]Oh, yeah, well...
[08:56.59]Sorry about that.
[08:58.13]Sorry about that.
[08:59.87]He wants me to play WoW.
[09:00.63]Basic Feral, I probably will not play WoW again.
[09:04.83]Really, really appreciate the $100, though, dude.
[09:06.81]Thank you so much.
[09:08.74]It's a lot of money.
[09:09.46]A couple of you guys have given more than $100.
[09:12.42]Tonight, right?
[09:13.02]Let me see.
[09:15.84]Yeah, Basic Feral did earlier.
[09:18.86]Well, I mean, right now.
[09:21.48]You think I should play WoW on stream?
[09:23.32]I don't think I'll ever do that again.
[09:27.58]No, no way.
[09:29.34]I will never play WoW on stream.
[09:30.51]Yeah, Polo just gave $100 earlier.
[09:31.97]So thank both of you guys so much.
[09:34.31]So much.
[09:35.49]So much.
[09:39.41]Clicker.
[09:42.23]For certain spells and abilities, of course I was.
[09:45.41]To do cast fucking power fortitude.
[09:49.30]Yes.
[09:50.92]I just almost opened up my password book.
[09:56.98]That would have been a mistake.
[10:02.26]No, no, I'm not playing GeoGuessr.
[10:05.42]We're taking a small break so I can just breathe for a little bit in the light.
[10:14.08]Yeah, I was a clicker in WoW.
[10:16.84]Not for my main abilities, for the shit that doesn't matter.
[10:20.65]The stuff that was on 5 minute cooldown, I would click it.
[10:24.23]Somebody get me.
[10:27.44]I'm not playing GeoGuessr.
[10:29.81]No.
[10:31.89]No.
[10:32.79]I don't want to go to school, Mom.
[10:34.15]I'm not playing GeoGuessr.
[10:37.29]Oh, yeah?
[10:38.43]Can you guys do this shit?
[10:39.39]I need a bigger one.
[10:45.74]Have you seen anybody do something like this before?
[10:49.50]Hey, look at that.
[10:50.30]Pew.
[10:51.08]Got ya.
[10:54.57]If a criminal was to come in here right now... Oh, shit, someone's, like, coming in.
[10:57.88]Oh, fuck, dude.
[10:59.54]Oh, he's got a knife!
[11:06.60]Got him!
[11:16.55]Now, I didn't have the knife.
[11:17.59]He did, and I stopped him with my rubber band finger chute.
[11:25.27]More money just came in.
[11:26.09]$15 from one Blondie.
[11:30.30]Thank you.
[11:31.68]Thank you one Blondie for the 15 bucks.
[11:33.26]Jeremiah, I'm writing a D&D campaign.
[11:34.72]Would you name me a cool wizard?
[11:40.14]Okay.
[11:44.91]A cool wizard.
[11:51.38]uh strangler no that's not a wizard's name I just said that because I put my hand on my neck I that I just that's the only reason why I said that uh how about thread ripper no that's a that's like an amd chip don't name him thread ripper uh
[12:33.20]Paper is fire.
[12:42.30]I guess.
[12:48.05]Like this.
[13:02.59]That's a cool name.
[13:09.22]Wow, that's so cool.
[13:11.86]Have you seen somebody do that?
[13:14.44]I'll tell you right now, I'm afraid to pull this all the way until this breaks.
[13:18.30]I'm scared to do this.
[13:19.96]Just like the balloon shit.
[13:20.87]I can't do it.
[13:21.95]If I pull this too much, I can't.
[13:23.53]I've got to close it because it's going to break and it'll scare me.
[13:26.55]Don't do it.
[13:27.41]It's going to hurt me.
[13:29.20]It's going to go smack against here and it's going to hurt for five seconds and I'm going to hate it.
[13:35.71]No, dude.
[13:36.53]This is going to bounce back and go in my eye.
[13:41.89]No, I can't do it.
[13:42.95]I fucking can't do this.
[13:46.26]No.
[13:56.32]Okay, I got it.
[14:01.02]That hurt.
[14:01.76]That hurt my hand right there.
[14:04.40]You see, it went like straight through my hand out the other side.
[14:09.32]Why would I do that to myself?
[14:10.76]Because now I get to do this.
[14:13.72]If you went back to medieval times and you walked up to a person on the street and you said, hey, look at this.
[14:17.50]Hey, hey, look, look, look, look, look.
[14:18.54]Don't, don't, don't, don't stop looking.
[14:21.28]Would they go, oh, would they think you were a fucking demon?
[14:26.26]Because it just got big in your head.
[14:27.56]Like what?
[14:28.11]They don't have that kind of shit back then.
[14:31.56]Like, you see how small this is?
[14:32.46]Just don't take your eye off it.
[14:38.37]They would start burning you.
[14:42.31]It got big.
[14:43.11]That would be something you would never even see in, like, the 1200s.
[14:50.19]But it got big in your hand like this.
[14:55.61]You know what the funny thing about going back?
[14:57.51]People say, oh, if you went back in time and showed them the fire with the lighter.
[15:00.24]No.
[15:02.90]Just bring this with you.
[15:05.94]That's all you would need.
[15:06.72]You don't need to bring anything else.
[15:08.26]You can bring anything.
[15:09.54]Any object that you have in your house.
[15:11.39]Just walk up to somebody and go... They'd be like, what the fuck is that thing?
[15:15.91]And they'd start scratching at you.
[15:19.31]I'm like, yeah, just go back and be a god.
[15:22.57]Watch this.
[15:22.95]You want to know how to be a god back in the 1200s?
[15:25.59]Just show up, walk into the throne room.
[15:28.73]Yes, I'd like an audience with the king.
[15:30.27]Okay, come on, come down here, sir.
[15:31.47]Yeah, sure thing.
[15:32.05]Yeah, what are you?
[15:32.74]This weirdo off with his head.
[15:34.38]And all you got to do is this.
[15:35.14]You got to say, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, before you take my head off, I know I might have said something about the king not being the real king, but...
[15:46.69]The whole place would just start fucking crunching down like this and bowing.
[15:53.17]What is that device?
[15:54.09]What is that thing?
[15:54.81]He must be from a different world.
[15:56.23]You could just hold it in front of them.
[16:03.68]They'd be like... Like, look at yourself in the... Mirrors didn't exist back then.
[16:10.86]Yeah, how about this, guys?
[16:11.78]Do it to yourself.
[16:13.54]What do you see?
[16:17.26]They would execute you?
[16:18.05]No, you wouldn't.
[16:18.47]Because if you were like, come near me with those blades and I will cast everyone down six feet into their graves, they would believe you.
[16:27.45]Just show up with one of these.
[16:29.01]Just show up like this and be like, I can control your mind with my controller plug-in.
[16:34.66]They would freak the fuck out if you showed them this.
[16:40.76]What else?
[16:44.09]Even like this.
[16:47.61]like a fucking cleaning bottle of spray shit you know you could bring a you could bring a paper towel and cleaner and you would scare and they would they would bow and you would be the new king you'd have to just go like stand still while I demonstrate and they would just be like fuck me man this guy's gonna kill us all they would smell it too they'd be like I don't know what that that potion is
[17:15.52]Show up with 100,000 V-Bucks?
[17:19.58]No, no Fortnite references, come on.
[17:25.32]Batteries.
[17:30.29]I was gonna say hair.
[17:31.83]Like, look, I can comb my hair, but they, that, everyone had, people had hair back then.
[17:38.13]It's not like they didn't have hair.
[17:40.01]Look at this!
[17:41.57]Hair!
[17:42.49]All of a sudden, like, you get a knife through the back.
[17:46.02]Can you believe it?
[17:47.28]Look at this, aren't you scared now?
[17:51.50]Just go forward and fall into the fucking pit.
[17:56.85]Hey, somebody just gave you 30 bucks.
[17:59.59]KXC, thanks for the 30 bucks, dude.
[18:01.21]KXC501, thank you, man.
[18:05.43]Bits deployed.
[18:07.19]Now.
[18:09.64]Thank you.
[18:10.92]For the 30 fucking dollars.
[18:15.58]I want to change my vote.
[18:17.96]You don't get to change your vote.
[18:19.60]Now you're stuck with it.
[18:21.70]You're stuck with like the weird guy on camera.
[18:24.85]Before we were playing a game where it was like audio and it was hard and now you get the fucking weird guy on camera.
[18:31.03]And the lights are on too.
[18:35.96]Go stream in the middle ages.
[18:38.52]That'd be interesting.
[18:41.58]No it wouldn't.
[18:42.12]That would be stupid.
[18:44.24]Nobody who has a computer.
[18:45.30]You'd be sitting in your bedroom alone.
[18:47.32]Streaming to no one.
[18:48.22]Because there's no electricity back then.
[18:52.34]They were lighting fires.
[18:54.10]With sticks.
[18:56.26]Scream as loud as you can.
[19:02.46]Is that good enough for you?
[19:14.91]I'm not even talking about politics.
[19:16.55]Hey, what about your opinion on politics?
[19:19.45]Hey, what do you know about politics, dude?
[19:26.04]We don't talk politics here.
[19:28.18]We joke talk politics.
[19:32.22]Not for real.
[19:36.46]Yes, we do.
[19:36.94]No, we don't.
[19:39.38]We don't actually really talk politics.
[19:43.91]My hair feels like it's made out of straw.
[19:48.05]It's not muted.
[19:48.61]I can see it on the thing.
[19:49.87]You can't lie to me right now.
[19:56.59]I'm going for... No, I can't.
[19:58.37]I'm not saying any words.
[19:59.05]You're not going to get me to talk about anything.
[20:03.65]Unless it has something to do with... What about that, huh?
[20:07.72]Huh?
[20:07.88]Is that going to shut you up?
[20:09.02]What about this thing?
[20:11.30]That's right.
[20:12.16]Bow to your new king.
[20:17.29]prank call someone?
[20:20.63]No.
[20:21.93]I wouldn't want to be prank called by somebody.
[20:27.14]We can see that our politics is open in the reflection.
[20:32.34]Why would I go to our politics?
[20:40.58]I'm one of those people.
[20:41.54]I mean, look, I have opinions and everything, but if there was, if there's like a political argument going on most of the time, I'm like that.
[20:47.41]I'm kind of that guy that will slowly just go in the other room.
[20:52.03]If it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[20:54.19]Excuse me.
[20:55.21]You need to tell me that we have a system in place.
[20:58.17]And I'm just like, slowly getting out of the room.
[21:05.01]And then from the other room, I scream an incredibly volatile topic.
[21:09.00]And then they keep going.
[21:09.78]It's like my own personal, like they're on goddamn strings.
[21:12.84]You know what I mean?
[21:13.32]I just go, hey, what about Wall Street?
[21:15.58]And I'm like back there like, hey, what do you think about like education?
[21:22.13]And then they start fucking yelling at each other about education.
[21:29.08]Why do I use buds?
[21:29.84]Because I'm fucking weird and I have terrible problems.
[21:34.37]I can't have two headphones on at the same time.
[21:35.99]I can't have my ears covered because it freaks me out because it sounds like I'm underwater and it's hard for me to talk.
[21:41.44]So I need to have earbuds.
[21:43.60]I can't do headphones.
[21:49.02]Have I ever effed so bad that it hurt my ass?
[21:53.32]No.
[21:55.26]Alliance or horde I can't that's even worse I don't know if it's worse for me to talk if like I could talk about like politics real politics or I could tell you for the Alliance and I Wonder which one would cause more blowback Which one is worse in a public sphere Well, you know, I play a horde character.
[22:18.42]I
[22:26.72]He already said it.
[22:27.48]No, I didn't.
[22:28.78]I said that would be if I did say that it would cause a problem.
[22:36.79]As the bee situation seems to be under control.
[22:39.41]I don't think there is any... There are no bees left, I don't think.
[22:44.44]Not since that night.
[22:45.86]There was one more that was overnight, but that was it.
[22:50.02]You want your money back because I play Alliance.
[22:52.90]Um...
[22:56.62]No, there are no refunds.
[22:59.98]You should have researched the streamer you were watching.
[23:04.74]Right?
[23:07.44]Send me nudes.
[23:15.27]What do you think this is?
[23:15.85]Some kind of fucking game?
[23:19.85]What do you think this is?
[23:21.83]You think it's some kind of joke?
[23:26.35]Look at that.
[23:26.83]I made the... I made it.
[23:27.89]I did it.
[23:28.89]I made the cat's cradle.
[23:34.67]Shit.
[23:34.85]I didn't mean to do that.
[23:37.31]He's a clicker.
[23:37.97]Of course he would play alliance.
[23:39.67]No, I played alliance because I thought the gnomes were funny.
[23:43.93]And dwarves are just cool.
[23:48.45]Somebody's given out five... Somebody just gave five subs.
[23:52.55]Wait, what?
[23:55.17]Kazzy101 is giving out five community subs.
[24:01.61]Oh, wow.
[24:02.51]Well, thank you, Kazzy.
[24:03.17]I don't know who you're giving them to, but thanks.
[24:04.49]That's cool.
[24:08.87]Here they come.
[24:13.46]Thank you for the subs, man.
[24:17.82]She gave one to me?
[24:20.20]Well, thank you.
[24:21.18]I'm looking at the wrong camera, by the way.
[24:22.54]This is the camera I was just looking at.
[24:23.80]Let's get, let's, you know, fuck it.
[24:26.07]Fuck it.
[24:26.63]Here we go.
[24:27.01]You wanna see some real medieval shit that'll make you turn your head upside down?
[24:31.03]I was looking in the wrong camera.
[24:38.95]Watch this.
[24:44.92]Ready?
[25:08.58]They're on the same... This is that one, right?
[25:11.12]This is this one.
[25:14.82]Kiss!
[25:16.36]You know what's weird?
[25:19.60]Stay right there.
[25:20.63]This is gonna take some thought.
[25:25.35]Could I delay this one by like 10 seconds?
[25:29.74]Do a bunch of shit and then have this one's not delayed and then I can react to me talking to myself.
[25:39.02]Wait a minute.
[25:49.97]I can't tell you that this is not going to be real weird.
[25:54.62]Hold on, where is it?
[25:55.50]I think I have them disabled.
[25:59.72]Hold on a second.
[26:00.50]This is going to be fucked up.
[26:02.88]I hope you guys are ready for this.
[26:03.86]This is going to be really fucked up.
[26:10.95]I need to show disabled devices.
[26:16.55]Okay, hold on.
[26:17.29]Enable this.
[26:19.43]Oh, boys.
[26:19.97]This is going to get weird.
[26:22.81]Hold on.
[26:25.73]Hold on, hold on.
[26:26.59]Everybody calm down for a second.
[26:30.17]Stream's gonna crash.
[26:31.52]Alright, the stream crashes.
[26:32.70]Just hold on.
[26:35.34]It's already very... Hold on, I gotta... Okay.
[26:48.57]That's better.
[26:49.01]Now this needs to be... Right here.
[26:55.41]Hey.
[26:56.35]Hey, how are you?
[27:06.32]Now, I have to make this delayed.
[27:10.94]Here we go.
[27:13.58]This is gonna be fucking crazy.
[27:17.42]So this is the webcam.
[27:18.10]This has to be delayed by... How many milliseconds?
[27:22.93]Like...
[27:25.61]10,000?
[27:27.53]Right?
[27:30.69]What did that do?
[27:37.57]Right?
[27:38.49]Does it work?
[27:40.73]What did that do?
[27:43.40]Hmm.
[27:48.54]Does it work?
[27:53.14]How about now?
[28:03.19]How about now?
[29:03.34]So I was at the mall the other day.
[29:04.54]You're a fucking idiot.
[29:05.66]I fucking hate everything about you.
[29:07.34]I think you suck.
[29:08.04]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[29:09.42]You deserve to get the fuck out of here.
[29:10.95]You think you know a goddamn thing about me and my life?
[29:13.39]So I was at the mall the other day.
[29:14.99]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[29:19.33]Shut the fuck you, dude.

[29:48.61]Nothing much.
[29:49.01]How are you doing?
[29:49.61]No, nothing.
[29:49.95]I'm just curious as to why you're like the worst streamer on Twitch.
[29:52.11]How's that what you think?
[29:52.85]You think that's what you think?
[29:53.91]You fucking idiot.
[29:55.13]Hey, hey, how you doing, man?
[29:56.19]Good to see you again.

[30:02.90]You think that's what you think?
[30:03.96]You fucking idiot.

[33:45.64]Please don't go on the top rope.
