[00:40.53]This isn't even on Twitch's directory, by the way.
[00:44.63]GaryTheGull doesn't exist on the Twitch directory.
[00:47.81]That's how you know it's gonna be great.
[00:49.83]Um... We're gonna go with EagleFlight.
[00:58.38]Alright, this one exists and we'll play it.

[05:54.51]Okay.
[05:55.55]Now we're gonna play a real bird game, guys.
[06:00.22]Now we're gonna play a real game for birds.
[06:08.44]You thought that was the first game about birds?
[06:10.20]No, this is the real game.
[06:12.26]What the fucking bird?
[06:17.09]Warning before playing.
[06:17.97]Please read carefully the instructions and health shot app.
[06:21.63]Please consult your doctor before resuming the game.
[06:27.36]Oh, shit.
[06:28.14]That one of you, I gotta call my doctor before I keep playing.
[06:30.80]Let me pause the game and call the doctor.
[06:33.12]Hey, listen, doctor.
[06:35.83]I'm loading up Eagle Flight right now.
[06:38.33]It's a VR game.
[06:39.55]It's on pause right now.
[06:40.67]Can I play this?
[06:43.87]My doctor's going to tell me never to fucking call him during off-business hours again.
[06:50.05]Call the fucking doctor.
[06:50.99]Oh, yes, you can play this game.
[06:54.15]Of course you can.
[06:54.81]It's a fucking video game.
[06:56.89]Leave me the fuck alone.
[06:58.44]I'm trying to bang my wife.
[07:01.88]That was uncalled for.
[07:03.72]That was uncalled for.
[07:05.10]I'm sorry.
[07:06.52]I'm sorry, but for real, though.
[07:07.70]Why do I need to call my fucking doctor?
[07:16.88]86.
[07:17.06]This reminds me of an old school Flash game.
[07:21.76]Staring at the loading bar, waiting for like 40 minutes.
[07:24.04]I think finally... Come on, let's go.
[07:35.55]Let's do it.

[08:13.19]This is fucking awesome.
[08:16.10]Oh man!
[08:21.11]This is just like in my dreams!
[08:22.65]Remember when you used to have dreams of flying?
[08:26.69]Now it's a reality.
[08:32.44]Is this the whole game?
[08:40.54]The sun rises over the beautiful city of Cairns.
[08:50.27]The sun rises over the beautiful city of Paris.
[08:54.09]Humans have long left this iconic city behind, and the wilderness has reclaimed the streets.
[09:01.35]Deer and wolves have made their homes here, sharing this urban jungle with exotic animals escaped from the zoo.
[09:10.16]Predators search for their next meal.
[09:12.80]Scavengers feast on the remains of a kill, while other threats lurk in the shadows.
[09:19.11]Get him!
[09:20.35]Get this motherfucker!
[09:27.46]Okay, I gotta stop.
[09:28.76]I gotta stop.
[09:29.70]The sun rises over the beautiful city of Paris.
[09:33.96]The sun rises.
[09:34.98]Oh, fuck.
[09:36.67]And the wilderness has reclaimed the streets.
[09:39.25]I got him.
[09:40.07]Okay, I gotta give me some credit.
[09:41.77]I got that zebra.
[09:43.97]Why is there a zebra walking on the sidewalk?
[09:46.29]Exotic animals escaped from the zoo.
[09:50.56]Why the fuck are there elephants in Paris just walking around?
[09:53.26]Oh, I gotta thread the needle.
[09:55.20]Can I thread the needle?
[09:56.60]Check this one out.
[09:58.40]Thread the needle.
[09:58.92]Oh.
[09:59.02]Oh.
[10:20.15]Oh, wow.
[10:20.76]Eagle flight.
[10:28.14]Oh, this is gonna make me throw up.
[10:31.82]I said, what do I do?
[10:41.07]Okay, that's actually my... What happened to the... What the fuck happened here?
[10:48.70]Oh, boy.

[11:15.80]No, I ain't slowing down for nothing!
[11:29.45]I just ripped out the cord.
[11:31.73]I think I just ripped out the cord.
[11:33.93]Hold on.
[11:34.61]Wait a sec.
[11:35.77]I got too into it.
[11:36.85]I got too distracted.
[11:37.81]I got too into it.
[11:39.81]Oh, we're good.
[11:43.07]We're good.
[11:44.36]We're okay.
[11:46.57]We're okay, we're good.
[11:48.13]I just got a little too into it.
[11:51.21]I just ripped out the cord.
[11:52.59]Connect the VR and then turn on the VR hit.
[11:54.63]What?
[12:01.51]Okay.
[12:03.35]That was fucking fun.

[12:19.67]What is going on at the top of the screen?
[12:22.23]Did I break my fucking VR headset?
[12:25.87]No, wait a minute.
[12:27.29]Why am I getting, like, screamed like it's a bad movie projector?
[12:38.25]I'm so confused.

[12:48.77]Alright, slow down.
[12:49.45]Without two, yeah.
[12:55.40]I guess.
[12:55.90]I don't know.
[12:59.04]What the hell is the point of this game?
[13:05.80]Is there something I should be doing?
[13:07.00]I'm going over there.
[13:08.66]No, I'm not.
[13:14.70]Flylet, you have earned a trophy.
[13:15.84]This is your nest.

[13:24.56]What?
[13:27.54]Uh... Okay, let's go to the lobby.
[13:31.76]Let's head to the lobby and... Hold on, I don't want to crash.

[28:32.78]Oh, shit!
[28:52.08]Scan him!
[28:54.02]Okay.
[29:02.59]Okay.
[29:10.97]What did we do?
[29:12.05]Oh, I gotta check my diabetes today.
[29:15.15]How is it?
[29:16.79]Let's see.
[29:18.69]Alfred, how does it look?
[29:22.14]Should I squirt it at him?
[29:24.50]Fuck.
[29:26.28]No, I need that.
[29:26.88]I need to check out my... Okay, where does this go?
[29:33.38]Does it go over here?
[29:36.49]How is this Batman?
[29:38.97]Hey, remember when Batman checked his blood sugar?
[29:42.29]What do I do?
[29:42.79]I don't... Alfred...
[29:52.38]Alfred, I don't understand this, really.
[29:57.64]Give me... I feel like this would be so much easier with the move controller.
[30:12.03]What a boring episode of Batman.
[30:18.86]I...
[30:21.03]Why is everything shaking?
[30:21.67]Check my blood again.
[30:22.29]Yeah, okay.
[30:22.53]Anything else?
[30:22.87]Come on, let's move this.
[30:55.23]I'm gonna put that into the sky.
[31:00.61]Is my blood done yet?
[31:01.63]Alright, let's check it.
[31:04.33]I'll just drink it.
[31:06.95]Oh.
[31:13.68]Oh, it's gone.
[31:19.60]What is this?
[31:20.20]I don't understand what this shit is.
[31:24.69]Alfred, get it.
[31:29.09]Give me this.
[31:30.57]How do I open it?
[31:35.55]Bat computer.
[31:39.45]What the fuck?
[31:45.59]Initializing the OI database.
[31:47.88]OK.
[32:00.09]Alright.
[32:02.65]Uh, like, I'm gonna rip this fucking thing off the- out of the- hold on.
[32:07.45]Oh, you fucking piece of crap VR.
[32:13.43]What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?
[32:14.58]Ugh.
[32:23.58]What- what if I put this in like the- I don't get this.
[32:28.96]Like, what does this want me to do?
[32:30.22]Can anybody, like, understand this?
[32:39.89]Like, should I... I really feel like I'm missing something here.
[32:56.40]Get me the fuck out of here.
[32:58.42]What's going on here?
[33:04.18]Batman collects Batman figurines, apparently.
[33:06.58]Alright, I'm going back to the Batcave.
[33:11.75]Fucking Alfred... I need the move controllers?
[33:16.07]Well, I don't have them.
[33:17.85]Wait, what's that?
[33:19.07]Demdrake, a.k.a.
[33:21.15]Robin.
[33:23.53]Richard Grayson.
[33:24.45]Oh, yeah.
[33:24.93]A.K.A.
[33:25.88]Activating.
[33:26.44]Activate the tracker.
[33:27.06]Nightwing's location tracker.
[33:28.98]Searching.
[33:30.38]Nightwing location.
[33:31.44]Identify.
[33:33.16]Nightwing is in central Gotham, but why isn't he responding?
[33:36.62]I should head to his location.
[33:37.81]You got it.
[33:38.07]He could be in danger.
[33:39.01]You got it, got it.
[33:39.69]Let's go.
[33:41.99]All right.
[33:44.89]Let's go talk to Alfred again.
[33:45.95]Let's go find Nightwing.
[33:50.55]Sir, I've readied the Batwing and the Batmobile for deployment.
[33:54.33]If Master Grayson's in trouble, every second counts.
[33:57.83]All right, let's do it.
[34:00.93]Oh, this is really starting to give me a headache.
[34:04.01]But I have to keep playing this.
[34:05.15]Please select vehicle.
[34:08.73]Vehicle selected.
[34:09.87]I got a spaceship?
[34:13.94]Since when do I get a spaceship?
[34:17.93]Selected.
[34:18.49]Oh, I'm going in the spaceship.
[34:19.99]Are you shitting me?
[34:23.27]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:26.01]No.
[34:27.25]Vehicle selected.
[34:28.43]We're going in the spaceship.
[34:36.76]You think we're not going in this?
[34:37.86]Yeah, right.
[34:39.26]Setting navigation coordinates.
[34:42.60]All right, let's play the game.
[34:44.30]Godspeed, Master Bruce.
[34:50.85]I haven't found him, Alfred.
[35:10.02]I don't know where he is.
[35:14.71]I haven't tracked him.
[35:16.13]I can only go to two spots, Alfred.
[35:19.43]You know, so it's not so easy to try to find Nightwing when I'm only allowed to go to two spots.
[35:25.42]Oh, there he is.
[35:26.04]Scan him.
[35:26.56]Oh.
[35:26.68]I just did that.
[35:45.01]Multiple trauma.
[35:46.69]Cause of death, cervical fracture.
[35:48.91]They broke your neck.
[35:51.09]You must have been in agony when you died.
[35:54.47]Why is he saying that so fucking meanly?
[35:57.19]You are the best fighter I ever trained.
[36:01.40]How did they beat you?
[36:03.62]If I can identify the precise moments when your three main injuries occurred, it might help me establish your killer's identity.
[36:10.82]I can use the forensic scanner to analyze the reconstruction.
[36:15.58]No injury detected.
[36:16.82]What is... Reached beginning of reconstruction.
[36:32.37]What the fuck are you talking about?
[36:34.45]No injury found.
[36:41.01]What is... I'm making him walk around.
[36:50.67]What?
[36:52.05]He's just in an alleyway with some like fucking banana guy?
[36:55.75]What the fuck?
[37:03.05]Let's see.
[37:03.43]What did that happen?
[37:04.09]That happened like that.
[37:09.07]Okay.
[37:10.59]So we know how that happened.
[37:11.39]Oh, good block.
[37:13.18]Oh, wow.
[37:13.92]Good.
[37:14.02]Nice job.
[37:21.61]I can't... I... Can you guys move back over here?
[37:38.65]Fix it!
[37:39.17]Wait, oh god, I gotta go back.
[37:41.35]I gotta go back!
[37:42.71]We gotta go back to when he got punched in the face.
[37:46.44]We gotta go back to when he got punched in the face.
[38:06.00]before the first blow fractured your jaw.
[38:08.14]Why hesitate?
[38:09.52]It goes against everything I taught you.
[38:11.06]Let's watch it again.
[38:13.58]The ribs weren't fractured by this point.
[38:15.62]That must have happened near the end of the fight.
[38:17.57]Let's go again.
[38:18.29]Let's watch it again.
[38:22.51]This is so fucking stupid.
[38:24.05]All right, good job.
[38:28.11]Wait, what?
[38:28.77]Where did his ribs break?
[38:30.11]Oh, that's right there.
[38:33.65]Okay.
[38:39.48]Get a different angle.
[38:40.14]Hold on, let's go.
[38:41.80]Let's watch from up here.
[38:45.02]Whoa!
[38:47.22]OK.
[38:48.56]What?
[39:02.97]What happened here?
[39:06.61]Let's go back over here.
[39:41.19]You were badly injured, no longer a threat.
[39:49.17]Your killer showed no mercy.
[39:52.55]Why did the killer flee the scene?
[39:54.47]What did they see?
[39:54.99]This game is fucking incredible.
[40:02.43]I never knew.
[40:07.20]I never knew that I needed this game in my life until right now.
[40:11.82]You know what I mean?
[40:12.36]Like, you never know when you just need a game in your life.
[40:27.06]God.
[40:37.92]Wait, who the fuck is that guy?
[40:39.00]Reached end of reconstruction.
[40:40.91]Who is this guy?
[40:41.77]Who the fuck is this?
[40:43.09]No fingerprints from the witness here.
[40:44.91]Reached end of reconstruction.
[40:47.77]Who the fuck is this guy?
[40:56.74]What, we gotta go back?
[40:59.82]These guys are smoking a cigarette.
[41:01.66]How many times are we gonna have to fuck up Nightwing?
[41:05.11]I need to find a moment with a full handprint.
[41:07.75]Right there.
[41:08.35]The witness was Jackie Flynn, low-level criminal and known associate of the Penguin.
[41:13.33]All right.
[41:15.06]I need to pay Penguin a visit.
[41:16.66]Oh, let's go see Penguin.
[41:18.56]Ending reconstruction.
[41:19.88]Oh.
[41:21.42]I'm sorry, Dick.
[41:23.10]I should have been here.
[41:23.94]Nightwing.
[41:25.26]If Cobblepot had anything to do with your murder, I'll make him regret it.
[41:29.12]Oh, God, this game is fucking amazing.
[41:36.24]That was very forgiving.
[41:37.14]I was super forgiving.
[41:38.08]Ugh.
[41:38.20]Let's go.
[41:38.56]The penguin.
[41:39.97]I hope we can fucking slow-mo the... Oh, God.
[41:41.27]Yes.
[41:41.35]Okay.
[42:07.32]What?
[42:07.52]That didn't do anything!
[42:08.50]No!
[42:09.04]No!
[42:09.62]No, no, no, no!
[42:10.64]Let me go!
[42:15.22]You gonna ask some questions before you start with the bleeding scare tactics?
[42:20.83]I know why you're here.
[42:22.87]Your little buddy.
[42:25.37]Sidekick the bucket, didn't he?
[42:27.97]Scan him.
[42:29.09]Well, I bloody didn't do it!
[42:31.27]Put that right in his fucking eyeball.
[42:32.85]Look, this is all I know.
[42:34.51]I swear.
[42:36.35]Last night, one of my boys comes back to the club.
[42:40.23]Bloody terrified he is.
[42:43.03]He says he saw your boy done in.
[42:45.56]Said you'd be after him.
[42:48.14]Last thing he says, before some wanker blows him up.
[42:52.26]And after bloody ice... Fucking wanker.
[42:56.14]Okay.
[42:56.74]You want your witness?
[42:57.70]He's in the morgue.
[43:00.02]Surprise, bad freak.
[43:04.30]I said, turn around.
[43:05.04]I did.
[43:05.54]Turn around, Batman.
[43:08.90]You want to turn this way?
[43:11.25]You want to go this way?
[43:12.77]You want to turn around?
[43:31.36]Kiddly!
[43:36.36]What the fuck are you talking- Turn around!
[43:43.36]Right, I'll turn around.
[43:50.69]If I take out a gadget, England's men will follow.
[43:53.39]The Batwing is inbound, sir.
[43:55.46]Please identify the targets to be neutralized.
[44:01.60]The line of sight targeting engaged.
[44:10.29]Awaiting targets, sir.
[44:11.67]Very good, sir.
[44:12.39]What's the matter, Batman?
[44:14.35]Scared?
[44:15.99]It'll be over soon.
[44:18.19]What's gonna happen here?
[44:37.44]Wait a minute.
[44:41.74]All right, that guy's... What the fuck was that?
[44:58.11]Robin is still not responding, sir.
[45:00.15]If his disappearance is related to Master Grayson's murder, there must be a clue in that.
[45:09.49]Who the fuck is this person?
[45:11.01]What is this?
[45:13.15]Who's this dead guy?
[45:15.42]That's so creepy.
[45:16.56]Alright, scan him.
[45:18.56]The coroner's report may contain clues to assist with my analysis of the body.
[45:22.48]Anything happen to his penis?
[45:24.89]He's gonna have to check his penis.
[45:27.73]Nah, it's okay.
[45:31.21]The victims of the iceberg lounge bombing.
[45:34.37]The coroner identified a piece of shrapnel in one of the bodies.
[45:37.84]Looks like a fragment of the bomb's detonator.
[45:41.16]I need to analyze the bodies with the forensic scanner.
[45:44.04]Find enough fragments and I can determine the origin of the device.
[45:52.49]There it is, I got it.
[45:55.02]I need the forensic scanner to search for evidence.
[45:57.30]This guy has a USB cord in his leg.
[45:59.22]A piece of the detonator lodged in the adductor muscle of the victim's thigh.
[46:03.33]There could be shrapnel anywhere in the bodies.
[46:05.83]I can analyze both the bone and muscle layers by switching modes on the forensic scanner.
[46:29.93]Got it.
[46:31.85]There's the cake, Froster.
[46:33.67]A detonator fragment lodged in the victim's skull.
[46:37.98]There could be more of the detonator shrapnel in the remaining two victims.
[46:41.92]Oh, come on.
[46:42.60]I don't... Yeah, he's got a cigarette in him.
[46:49.94]Got it.
[46:50.64]A detonator fragment buried in the manubrium sternae.
[46:54.37]Partial serial number.
[47:01.02]A fragment of the detonator cut through the victim's soleus.
[47:03.92]Alright, yeah, that's it, right?
[47:05.96]There isn't enough here to trace the detonator's origin.
[47:08.62]I need to examine the third victim.
[47:10.12]My face is so sweaty right now.
[47:13.63]I'm gonna go bald.
[47:16.35]What the fuck is this?
[47:17.05]One, two, three?
[47:18.19]What?
[47:20.25]Oh, that's not a body.
[47:22.59]That's not a body.
[47:23.47]I thought that was the third body.
[47:24.23]Where the
[47:32.69]Where's this third body?
[47:33.65]There's one there, one in here.
[47:40.36]I, oh, hold on.
[47:45.80]I gotta come out.
[47:46.36]Oh.
[47:48.66]Oh.
[47:48.80]1019.
[47:53.08]Oh my lord, guys.
[47:55.56]Hold on.
[48:02.50]Turn my heater off.
[48:05.46]Yeah, I can't see what you guys are saying, unfortunately.
[48:07.17]Alright, where's this third body?
[48:15.27]Did it say third body?
[48:18.49]Oh, I might have to take a break.
[48:21.85]I'm starting to get, like, a fucking headache.
[48:24.73]Sweat check?
[48:25.25]I am sweating profusely right now.
[48:27.01]You don't even need... I don't even need to check you.
[48:29.93]Ugh.
[48:32.39]I don't know why.
[48:32.89]Something about this game just gave me a massive fucking headache.
[48:39.57]The penguin.
[48:40.19]You are the third body.
[48:41.39]I want to see without putting the headset on.
[48:52.52]Take your shirt off.
[48:57.24]I might... I'm starting to get a fucking migraine.
[49:02.48]Like, a real migraine.
[49:07.92]I could also... You know what?
[49:08.64]I will... Here's what I'll do.
[49:11.16]I'm gonna... I'm gonna take a break for a little while.
[49:16.14]And take some Tylenol.
[49:17.24]This just, like, came the fuck on real quick.
[49:23.71]Ugh.
[49:25.59]Yeah, well, um...
[49:27.59]Is it right in front of me?
[49:28.31]Alright, let me just get to like the end of this section.
[49:33.46]Let me get to the end of this section.
[49:36.08]And I'm gonna call it for a while.
[49:38.58]Alright.
[49:50.37]Where's this fucking third body?
[49:53.27]He said third body, right?
[49:54.51]Or am I out of my fucking mind?
[50:01.05]No, nope, no way No way oh Yeah, like just teleporting around just maybe like want to die All right, yeah, I'm gonna take a break I might or may not If that's not the case then I'm I'm fucking invested in this I So badly want to play the rest of this game So we're going to we're gonna stop for now.
[50:29.44]Oh
[50:31.06]I need to just get out of this helmet for some reason.
[50:32.70]It really just got to me right now.
[50:35.08]I gotta call the doctor.
[50:36.10]Yeah, I gotta call my doctor and see if this is okay.
[50:39.82]I'm right next to it.
[50:41.36]Well, it's saved.
[50:42.44]I'm gonna play this.
[50:43.32]If not tomorrow, then I might push back the movie stream because I want to do this.
[50:48.61]We'll see.
[50:49.51]I'm gonna find the move controllers as well.
[50:52.68]But I already wasn't really feeling that great when I started.
[50:56.30]And just right now, I think I was laughing really hard at the guy falling off the fucking building and breaking his ribs.
[51:02.06]I think that put me over the edge a little.
[51:05.92]So, we'll get the move controllers for next time.
[51:08.61]We'll get back to this.
[51:09.89]If not tomorrow, then Sunday.
[51:12.33]And we'll keep doing some VR stuff, so...
[51:15.10]Thanks for watching, guys.
