[00:03.35]You've never played Team Fortress Classic before.
[00:05.29]No, I've never played this game.
[00:06.23]I played it for like, okay, maybe like five seconds, and then I was done with it because I hated it.
[00:10.38]Team Fortress 2, you know, it's a great game, I love that, but this is some sort of... I'm gonna offend somebody.
[00:15.70]I don't like this.
[00:17.20]Someone's gonna be like, alright, grandchildren love this when they were little boys.
[00:21.12]No.
[00:21.38]No, it's... No.
[00:23.86]Okay.
[00:25.74]I'm not your grandchildren.
[00:27.20]You don't know.
[00:27.86]Are they trying to capture something over here?
[00:29.64]I don't see a control point.
[00:31.50]They have to bring this flag.
[00:32.84]They have to bring their flag over to this last point.
[00:35.76]Why?
[00:36.00]Oh, yeah, there it goes.
[00:40.35]Yeah!
[00:41.59]Wow, it's, uh... It's building.
[00:45.41]Oh, also, I completely didn't even think about this.
[00:47.85]I can't pick this up.
[00:49.49]I'm so used to being able to pick it up.
[00:53.05]Oh, right-click on it.
[00:53.91]Hey, Trevor.
[00:54.85]Well, that's inconvenient, because if you look this way, that's where the blue team is.
[01:00.91]Let's do team this way when I'm sleeping.
[01:04.08]I seriously cannot even see the crosshair.
[01:06.24]It's like blending into the ground It's so tiny what is this a crosshair for ants I?
[01:13.20]Just headshot that ng how much else do they have that's bull oh?
[01:20.89]My god this guy It's like a scout going nuts with the frying pan.
[01:25.91]Oh you want to see something else really funny.
[01:27.70]No oh
[01:32.57]Okay, good.
[01:33.45]It killed me in respawn!
[01:35.45]I'm going spy.
[01:37.39]This'll be easy.
[01:38.83]My mouse is broken again.
[01:40.33]I can't use my mouse.
[01:41.71]I have to kill myself.
[01:43.33]Again.
[01:43.61]The game tabbed out.
[01:45.42]I can't use my mouse.
[01:46.82]Hey, at least you have 150% health.
[01:48.86]You're dead.
[01:52.12]Enemy dis- What is this?
[01:54.80]You don't have a cloak.
[01:55.88]There is no cloak.
[01:57.22]I'm an enemy soldier.
[01:58.55]Backstab is still a thing.
[02:02.16]okay okay I can't I can't look I can't look around again and you can feign death no I can't I can't do anything because my mouse doesn't work what is my arm doing I'm gonna kill someone like this but I can't turn oh please I got somebody I killed a guy
[02:32.35]I'm bringing this down.
[02:34.20]WHAT?
[02:34.78]HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SHOOT A MAN WITH A SHOTGUN?
[02:36.94]THERE WAS LIKE THREE MEAT SHOTS.
[02:39.00]Dude, you're getting pretty mad.
[02:40.08]I don't even know if you're gonna make this video.
[02:42.22]I don't know.
[02:43.44]This is like really upsetting for me.
[02:47.41]How was this guy's time?
[02:48.29]Thank god.
[02:50.53]So zoomed in right now, I can't even tell what's going on.
[02:53.07]I can't even tell who I'm killing when I kill people.
[02:56.15]It's like, is he-
[03:01.56]This is you.
[03:02.60]This is you.
[03:04.10]Bye.
[03:04.40]What even hit me?
[03:09.20]Get rekt!
[03:10.52]Were there stickies there?
[03:11.36]Because I saw a pile of poop.
[03:13.26]That's pretty much what it looks like.
[03:15.34]It looks like poo.
[03:17.88]Okay, see, because I didn't understand what happened.
[03:20.78]How do I put on Gunboats?
[03:23.86]Oh my god.
[03:25.56]I'm almost dead already.
[03:26.82]What even hit me?
[03:27.74]There's no feedback.
[03:29.55]There's no closets to heal.
[03:31.93]How do I heal?
[03:32.69]There are grenades.
[03:34.47]Grenades.
[03:38.51]And it just says 60 seconds till the gate open, there's no timer?
[03:44.88]What is going on?
[03:47.86]I think, I don't know.
[03:48.74]I think we, did we lose?
[03:50.21]My score is negative four.
[03:51.85]Negative four.
[03:52.79]What did I do?
[03:55.05]What did you do?
[03:56.33]You must have like team killed.
[03:58.05]I didn't even think you could team kill.
[04:08.33]It's so ridiculous.
[04:08.99]Banana Land.
[04:10.45]Go to Banana Land.
[04:12.01]I'm going to Banana Land.
[04:13.63]Head to Banana Land and just take a look at the texture.
[04:17.14]Go take a look at that.
[04:18.62]Tell me if you know what the fuck is even going on.
[04:25.85]Oh yeah, this is a great texture.
[04:29.03]This isn't like painful to look at.
[04:31.69]It's just like green puke all over your whole screen.
[04:36.89]I collected the Halo.
[04:39.33]What a ripoff of Halo.
[04:42.37]What is going on?
[04:44.29]You can't, like, move.
[04:45.17]It, like, sucks you to the wall.
[04:46.45]I know!
[04:46.73]Why is it doing this?
[04:49.75]Because it's- I think it's a jump map.
[04:51.14]You have to, like, jump from platform to platform, I think.
[04:54.20]Go for it.
[04:54.82]You know, you're pretty good at jump maps.
[04:56.32]Go do it.
[04:56.84]Go on.
[04:57.10]But where am I going to?
[04:58.32]I can't- Give me- Oh, you're jumping from one puke green texture to the next identical puke green texture.
[05:07.75]Well, I reached the, like, backpack on the wall, and it didn't do anything!
[05:12.52]There's nothing there!
[05:13.66]Yeah, dude, it's banana land.
[05:15.48]Come on.
[05:17.65]Banana land.
[05:19.41]Seriously, and there's people all trying to go up into this tunnel, but because you can't walk through players in this game, they're just standing on each other's heads and like, no, it's like, my turn.
[05:27.03]No, my turn.
[05:27.95]My turn.
[05:28.63]My turn.
[05:29.35]My turn.
[05:30.27]It's my turn.
[05:31.45]My turn.
[05:31.77]Yeah, you gotta get past everybody.
[05:33.85]I got into the crawl space.
[05:36.10]There's nothing up here!
[05:39.92]What do you expect you're gonna be doing on banana land?
[05:42.63]There's nothing up in Banana Land!
[05:44.73]There's no reason to be in Banana Land!
[05:46.63]And they're like, okay, I collected the stupid halo from up there.
[05:50.14]Let me go out this doorway.
[05:51.24]No, suck you to the wall.
[05:53.14]Nothing to do here.
[05:54.10]I can't look at this!
[05:55.76]I know, I had to quit.
[05:57.98]I quit immediately.
[05:59.06]I couldn't even look at it.
[06:00.34]And then what the heck is this?
[06:02.20]It's just pulling me everywhere.
[06:04.55]Is this Ricochet 2?
[06:08.95]What is this?! !
[06:16.75]Can I get inside this?
[06:20.95]Honest to God, not lying at all, not kidding at all in the slightest bit, I seriously, like, kind of feel sick right now because of Bananaland.
[06:30.18]Oh my god, oh my god.
[06:34.20]The walls are now spinning with the same Bananaland texture.
[06:38.20]Oh, I'm so glad I left.
[06:40.74]And there's another halo over here.
[06:42.73]If I had stayed in Banana Land for like another 10 minutes, I would have had to get off the computer because I would have been like motion sick.
[06:49.74]Discovering Banana Land really helped me realize something pretty important, and that's that Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2 really aren't that different, I guess.
[06:59.15]It had Dust Bowl, it had 2Fort, it had Banana Land.
[07:03.53]It's pretty much the same thing.
[07:09.45]Market Garden.
[07:11.66]Yeah, here we go.
[07:12.60]Here we go, here we go.
[07:19.66]I don't think it worked.
[07:28.59]What the?
[07:30.39]It's not fair.
