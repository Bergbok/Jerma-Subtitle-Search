[00:07.89]Father?
[00:09.01]When can I go and play with the puppies, daddy?
[00:12.30]I'm Lucius.
[00:13.28]I'm Lucius.
[00:14.24]I'm such a bad boy, such a bad, bad boy.
[00:16.18]I'm Lucius.
[00:17.20]I'm Lucius.
[00:18.16]I'm gonna kill you.
[00:19.46]What?
[00:20.06]What?
[00:22.02]Please let that be in the video.
[00:26.22]What?
[00:28.79]What's wrong with this guy?
[00:38.99]This guy was just trying to get me, and yell at me and stuff, and now he's just marveling at the sink.
[00:45.29]So we're gonna try this.
[00:49.63]Hello?
[00:51.09]Yes, please.
[00:52.17]Take me to the authorities.
[00:54.95]You would seriously think that after doing this like 15 to 16 times, this guy would look down and be like, I shouldn't walk on the green shit!
[01:01.52]No.
[01:02.08]Of course not.
[01:07.37]I'm Lucius.
[01:08.37]I'm Lucius.
[01:09.07]Hello, nurse.
[01:09.97]Hey, what's going on, guy?
[01:11.25]I'm Lucius.
[01:12.27]I'm Lucius.
[01:13.19]I'm gonna take over your fucking mind.
[01:15.10]I'm Lucius.
[01:16.04]I'm Lucius.
[01:17.00]I'm gonna go walk into a- I'm scared.
[01:31.15]What?
[01:32.33]What am I seeing?
[01:32.89]What?
[01:37.29]What am I seeing?
[01:38.21]Dude, I'm like a supernatural psycho dragging around a bookshelf.
[01:42.67]Like, what do you mean, what am I seeing?
[01:52.08]What the fuck is-?
[01:54.70]Pick up those ciggy butts, pick up those ciggy butts!
[01:59.23]Oh, she actually did.
[02:00.37]She just took them!
[02:01.11]What?
[02:01.47]You stole those cigarettes?
[02:05.62]I clearly threw those on the ground.
[02:07.64]So now... I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[02:11.11]What's this?
[02:11.65]I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[02:13.09]You wanna get canned?
[02:14.53]You ever been to Kansas?
[02:15.71]I'm gonna fucking can ya.
[02:17.79]This lady keeps ducking.
[02:20.79]What are you eating?
[02:21.94]Invisible food?
[02:23.24]I love invisible food.
[02:24.16]What about the guy on the left?
[02:24.92]What's he doing here?
[02:25.58]Just wearing that nice shirt?
[02:27.28]Fucking naked guy?
[02:28.24]Just walking through?
[02:41.69]This guy's gonna have a lot of trouble.
[02:47.61]What the fuck?
[02:48.49]He dropped it!
[02:52.26]You're not even doing anything!
[02:53.56]You dropped it, dude!
[02:58.46]Without context, this is really strange.
[03:03.49]What's this guy's story?
[03:04.47]I wanna know his fall story.
[03:08.36]Yeah, your arm's going to be fine.
[03:09.40]Don't worry.
[03:09.84]I mean, we're in a hospital right now.
[03:11.66]You're probably here for surgery or something.
[03:13.69]Let me get you to your emergency room surgery room.
[03:16.85]Jeez.
[03:18.35]So on the right here, as you can see, I'm going to give you a little quick tour before we go to your room.
[03:21.85]That's going to be the operating room, but I want to introduce you to one of my favorite doctors.
[03:25.81]Over here is Dr. Dean Dingleman.
[03:28.15]Dean Dingleman, here's the patient you'll be operating on.
[03:30.72]Uh, his name is, uh, Cryden.
[03:32.20]Kayden?
[03:32.92]Whatever his name is.
[03:34.02]Uh, yeah, I just wanted to give you a close interaction with the doctor before you go and prep for surgery.
[03:38.98]Just take you up the floor, too.
[03:40.36]That's all we gotta do here.
[03:41.60]Just don't mind me.
[03:42.48]I mean, this thing's always broken.
[03:43.98]Gotta throw a can of dog food at it to make sure we can get it open.
[03:47.14]But, yeah, I mean, can you believe that weather?
[03:49.08]I mean, we had, like, a foot of snow today.
[03:50.87]I mean, can you believe- No.
[03:56.25]You're not gonna let me push him out the elevator?
[03:59.25]Let me push a guy out a fucking elevator.
[04:01.71]Fucking high C, Ecto Cooler.
[04:03.23]Let's see how you deal with this one.
[04:05.38]Alright, sir, so go ahead and... I knew it.
[04:07.96]They always slip.
[04:08.78]It doesn't matter if they're sitting, if they're on a fucking workout bench.
[04:11.12]It doesn't matter.
[04:11.94]It does not matter.
[04:27.09]I didn't even... I didn't do that.
[04:29.31]Everybody just saw that I came back from... I loaded into the game, and this happened.
[04:34.99]I don't know what happened here.
[04:36.45]I had nothing to do with this.
[04:37.93]Absolutely nothing to do with it.
[04:46.29]Who's gonna get the sandwich first?
[04:51.65]Everybody wanted the sandwich.
[04:53.15]What?! !
[04:57.68]I didn't poison that sandwich.
[05:00.04]I did not poison that sandwich.
[05:01.92]That guy just died.
[05:03.81]Because he ate a dirty sandwich.
[05:05.47]Wait just a second here.
[05:16.63]So you two... That's normal.
[05:19.11]You should be doing that.
[05:19.89]There's no reason why two people can't be sitting in the same spot at the same time.
[05:23.59]I mean, why...
[05:32.45]What are you doing?
[05:34.27]Hey guys, welcome to my new hit series called... What would happen if this would happen?
[05:38.79]So today, in this new episode of... What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[05:42.81]We have a thing of donuts here, and we've got these pills.
[05:45.69]We're gonna combine them, and we're gonna see, you know... What would happen if this was gonna happen?
[05:50.53]See, the doctor here, he doesn't even know there's donuts behind him.
[05:53.13]He's gonna pick up those donuts.
[05:54.57]Oh man, I mean, like, what's gonna happen here?
[05:55.93]He's gonna eat these donuts.
[05:56.83]He loves donuts with a giant pill box on them.
[05:59.63]And oh, whoa!
[06:02.58]So, next episode on... What would happen if this was going to happen?
[06:06.78]What would happen?
