[00:08.83]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.55]Jerma here with... Hold on a second.
[00:16.36]Oh, yeah.
[00:17.66]Oh, sh... That could have been really bad.
[00:24.04]Welcome to Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:25.47]My name is Jerma.
[00:26.81]This is Saturday's edition.
[00:28.97]Hope you're having a fantastic Saturday.
[00:30.49]Playing as the soldier right now.
[00:32.81]Why do I have this loadout?
[00:36.36]It works!
[00:37.62]What, what the, what just happened?
[00:39.12]That guy just turned into a spy.
[00:40.48]Did you guys see that?
[00:42.30]So he was disguised as a Demoman.
[00:46.90]Well, that's one way to die.
[00:49.10]Playing, why do I have this loadout?
[00:50.54]Playing as the soldier I said previously.
[00:52.50]Oh!
[00:55.21]The server you are playing on has lost connection to the item server.
[00:58.21]As a result, your loadout will not be available for this server.
[01:03.99]Okay.
[01:05.61]We'll go with straight up default.
[01:07.01]I'm cool with that.
[01:08.71]Let me fill the rest of this up before I get it all over myself.
[01:13.75]So, we are getting absolutely rolled right now.
[01:18.41]Get him off the cart, fellas.
[01:23.10]I good at rocket jumping, look.
[01:26.66]Oh, that was a crit.
[01:28.56]He doesn't know I'm in here.
[01:29.30]Come on.
[01:34.02]Oh, get rid of all of them.
[01:36.84]I got the shotgun.
[01:37.58]I got the shotgun.
[01:38.16]I'm good to go.
[01:40.70]Up from above.
[01:41.48]Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44.44]Oh, that's a double kill?
[01:48.60]Anybody else?
[01:49.46]Another sniper?
[01:50.98]Oh!
[01:51.74]Come here!
[01:56.47]I gotta be careful here.
[01:57.41]I don't want to get myself killed.
[01:59.09]Ooh.
[02:01.09]Spy soldier.
[02:02.19]What?
[02:04.37]Oh my god!
[02:07.36]Oh, I also want to tell you guys what I did.
[02:09.18]I got a lot of comments on that video I did yesterday, the crazy 50,000 milestone.
[02:16.07]And people were saying, oh, I wasted a ton of food.
[02:18.67]Which I did.
[02:19.75]I do say that I did waste a bunch of that ice cream.
[02:22.49]But, to make up for it, I donated $50 to my local food bank.
[02:28.35]So, I think that might help with the wasteful food.
[02:34.23]that I did in the previous day.
[02:36.73]So I just want to let you guys know that I did that, because a lot of people were concerned.
[02:39.23]They were like, oh man, you wasted so much food.
[02:41.49]There's so many people that would have probably eaten that.
[02:44.02]And I do agree with you.
[02:45.72]So I donated some money to my food bank.
[02:49.58]So somebody can have an ice cream party.
[02:53.10]But we are going to lose right now.
[02:57.63]No!
[02:58.33]No!
[02:59.31]No!
[02:59.63]Come on!
[03:00.25]Come on!
[03:04.55]Don't kill me!
[03:05.47]Please don't kill me!
[03:11.68]Gotta go.
[03:12.92]Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[03:13.76]Come here!
[03:14.06]Don't die!
[03:16.82]It's all about the medic.
[03:18.20]Now we just have to defend this for nine and a half minutes.
[03:21.85]Good thing that's gonna happen.
[03:24.09]It could.
[03:25.11]It could.
[03:25.51]I think I'm overreacting here.
[03:27.95]We can do this.
[03:30.17]Come here, you son of a... He's stuck on the door!
[03:34.49]Run away!
[03:48.14]Two seconds, one second, come on!
[03:52.13]Oh, it's another roll!
[03:53.85]It's another- I'm staying back here for a little bit.
[03:55.53]I need to get some overheal.
[03:56.61]Oh!
[03:57.59]Oh my god!
[04:01.71]Dude, that guy's head exploded!
[04:05.19]Oh, just go!
[04:06.37]Come here, Heavy!
[04:07.29]Come here!
[04:08.76]That's what you gotta do.
[04:09.74]In these situations, you just gotta be a psycho!
[04:13.20]No!
[04:15.28]Come here!
[04:16.14]Get over here!
[04:17.54]Come here!
[04:18.50]Get- Yeah!
[04:19.24]Oh!
[04:21.04]It worked!
[04:21.46]It worked!
[04:21.78]I didn't get it!
[04:23.84]Oh, there's a heavy now.
[04:25.97]Get him off, Pyro!
[04:26.71]Come on, Pyro!
[04:28.33]Come on, Pyro!
[04:30.27]What are you... What were you guys AFK for?
[04:32.47]Hey, we still got it.
[04:39.17]We still got it.
[04:40.24]Just get down here.
[04:44.44]You are definitely a spy.
[04:45.82]Like, I guarantee it.
[04:48.54]Somebody come down here with me.
[04:51.65]Drop down.
[04:52.15]Drop down on the cart, man.
[04:55.74]Ooh.
[04:58.44]Overheels.
[04:58.86]Overheels.
[04:59.26]Overheel.
[04:59.62]Overheel.
[04:59.98]Overheel.
[05:00.30]I don't want to get backstabbed.
[05:04.57]Oh, I didn't get back.
[05:05.45]I got frontstabbed.
[05:07.31]It's over.
[05:08.35]It's over.
[05:09.77]That same pyro man is a legend.
[05:11.71]He keeps stopping them.
[05:16.06]Oh.
[05:21.46]Oh well.
[05:25.42]I tried to go in there with the Chaos Medic.
[05:27.08]You can always try it again.
[05:29.76]We'll do one more.
[05:30.90]I got a feeling this one is going to be the real wow factor.
[05:34.70]I think I got the loadout back.
[05:36.90]Oh yeah.
[05:38.17]Critch Creek it is.
[05:42.71]Hey!
[05:43.39]Why did you do that?
[05:46.19]Setup time?
[05:47.57]Well, that's not how you come back from setup time.
[05:49.66]I accidentally stopped recording.
[05:51.56]It's okay, though.
[05:53.54]It's okay.
[05:54.00]We didn't miss much.
[05:54.66]You just missed them capping the first point in, like, two seconds.
[05:59.66]Oh my god, it's so terrifying.
[06:02.35]Come here.
[06:04.29]Come here.
[06:04.81]No, it's everyone's a spy.
[06:06.33]Everybody's a spy.
[06:09.85]Medic on medic.
[06:10.71]Action.
[06:11.59]Oh no.
[06:13.27]Oh, we are just getting absolutely crushed.
[06:16.67]There's gotta be something we can do here.
[06:18.05]Nope.
[06:18.95]That is a spy, for sure.
[06:20.89]You are definitely a spy.
[06:22.87]No, stay alive!
[06:24.94]Don't get burned!
[06:26.70]Oh, there's nothing I can do here!
[06:29.24]Same pyro again.
[06:30.10]You know what?
[06:31.06]Go on, Heavy!
[06:32.68]Rage Heavy!
[06:36.53]Let's go.
[06:37.63]Rage Heavy!
[06:41.07]With all the rage and all the strength I have... as a Heavy... I'm going to just hold the button down in somebody's FACE!
[06:52.18]Rage Heavy!
[06:54.08]Oh yeah?
[06:54.48]Enemies have received additional time, huh?
[06:56.82]We'll see what happens when they come around this corner!
[06:59.48]And I Rage Heavy their ass!
[07:03.28]Like you!
[07:04.62]Get Raged on!
[07:06.30]Oh, what's that?
[07:07.22]RAGE HEAVY!
[07:09.68]Oh, hey, what's going on, everybody?
[07:11.06]What's going on, everybody?
[07:12.24]Oh, my God.
[07:17.13]I don't have the sandwich.
[07:18.43]Oh, crap.
[07:20.85]Don't have the sandwich.
[07:21.87]Don't have the sandwich.
[07:22.87]Somebody's going to come from right here and kill me.
[07:24.93]Oh, that's the guy that's dominating me.
[07:34.22]No!
[07:34.84]No!
[07:35.34]I was going to get my revenge.
[07:36.28]Oh, I got it anyways.
[07:37.06]I got it anyways.
[07:38.43]I got my revenge anyways.
[07:42.91]We are getting so crushed right now.
[07:44.41]This is so bad.
[07:47.23]Even the Dr. Pepper can't give me the strength.
[07:50.63]What a world we live in.
[07:53.69]I think that's a spy.
[07:55.39]No, it's not.
[07:59.46]Come here, you.
[08:00.74]Come here, you!
[08:04.94]Where is he?
[08:06.69]Oh my god, he's right there!
[08:08.27]Damn it, I need health.
[08:12.46]I don't want to make myself known yet.
[08:14.54]Yikes!
[08:17.28]I need like a big health kit.
[08:22.92]There we go.
[08:23.54]There's a medic.
[08:24.72]There's a medic.
[08:31.24]Medic, heal me!
[08:33.48]I just heard him.
[08:34.10]Where is he?
[08:37.55]Dead.
[08:38.34]Kill the other one.
[08:38.96]Get rid of the other medic.
[08:42.84]Get rid of him.
[08:43.60]Yes.
[08:43.82]Alright, anybody?
[08:46.04]Anybody?
[08:46.32]Any spies?
[08:46.84]Any spies?
[08:49.20]You could be a spy.
[08:50.00]You could be.
[08:50.80]You're not, though.
[08:52.99]We're good.
[08:54.75]Don't let him get to the top.
[08:55.71]Don't let him get to the top.
[08:59.67]Give me the health.
[09:02.01]Oh, I gotta get up here.
[09:02.93]Gotta get up here.
[09:03.49]Come on, medic.
[09:04.17]Let's do it.
[09:05.94]No!
[09:07.24]Oh, they're gonna win.
[09:10.94]That's gonna be three losses in a row.
[09:15.91]Crap.
[09:18.99]It's alright.
[09:21.07]Set it to Granary?
[09:22.31]Sure, why not?
[09:24.15]We'll go to Granary.
[09:26.67]At least I'll get this one guy.
[09:27.95]Yay, my thing leveled up.
[09:31.23]He's taunting.
[09:31.83]He's taunting.
[09:32.49]They're taunting.
[09:33.33]Get on there.
[09:34.03]Get on it.
[09:35.33]Blow up.
[09:37.13]What?
[09:39.14]Aww.
[09:40.50]I didn't get to see everybody blow up.
[09:41.98]That was what I wanted to stand there and watch for.
[09:43.74]Oh, well.
[09:47.84]Well, that's going to wrap up this Facecam Fortress 2 Saturday's Edition, guys.
[09:51.79]Thank you so much for watching.
[09:52.81]I really do appreciate it.
[09:54.23]And, of course, take care, everybody.
[09:57.67]Yeah!
