[00:02.61]Let's give this a try.
[00:05.09]Let's see how this one plays out.
[00:06.67]I am bringing it back.
[00:11.71]Let's change this.
[00:13.43]Let's see if this can get captured.
[00:17.17]There it is.
[00:20.20]Did it work?
[00:26.70]It doesn't look like it can be captured that way.
[00:28.82]Let's try something else.
[00:32.18]Let's see.
[00:37.46]Let's try a specific window.
[00:41.99]Window.
[00:45.41]I'll add window.
[00:57.59]Well, that's not working.
[00:59.11]Hold on.
[01:02.43]You can see the mouse on screen.
[01:09.90]Let me try to restart it.
[01:11.54]Oh, now you can see my Twitch dashboard.
[01:15.44]That's not what I wanted you to see.
[01:19.23]Now let's try this.
[01:28.07]Come on now.
[01:29.84]Come on.
[01:31.32]No, wrong thing.
[01:33.22]Oh, that's annoying.
[01:43.77]Might have to try something else here, because then I can't capture it for some reason.
[01:52.93]Hey!
[01:56.25]Smartest man alive.
[01:57.11]Smartest man in the room.
[01:57.97]Smartest fucking man in the room.
[02:00.72]Okay, let's do this.
[02:02.92]We're all set.
[02:06.78]Whisper into the mic.
[02:07.56]What's up, dude?
[02:10.44]Okay, so let's get that going.
[02:13.76]There's already the title changed.
[02:17.40]And I think the audio should be okay.
[02:20.70]At least I hope it is.
[02:21.48]Turn it up.
[02:21.78]Let's see.
[02:24.16]Background volume.
[02:25.72]How's that?
[02:27.50]How's that for volume?
[02:31.57]Turn off sepia, fuck that.
[02:32.83]Alright, here we go.
[02:35.87]Thank you, Sticked Renegade, for the five bucks.
[02:37.83]By the way, what happened to your toilet?
[02:39.13]I thought you probably broke it.
[02:40.09]Yeah, my toilet's broken upstairs.
[02:42.11]I don't know what the fuck I did to it.
[02:43.40]Just the water won't refill.
[02:46.00]Thank you, Retar, for your five dollars.
[02:50.36]Retar Joe.
[02:53.02]You sound taller, German.
[02:54.06]Did you gain height?
[02:55.40]Or are you just sitting on a pillow?
[02:56.76]I'm sitting on two pillows, actually.
[02:59.34]You must know.
[03:02.56]Just fucking taking a quick piss.
[03:05.84]And we can get started.
[03:06.94]There we go.
[03:09.88]Oh, I almost just fucked that up.
[03:14.94]All right.
[03:17.32]I think you're going to thank me for that.
[03:18.48]Actually, you gave $10.
[03:19.22]You sound tall.
[03:22.90]By the way, what happened to your toilet?
[03:24.42]Oh, that was not the same person.
[03:28.13]But thank you nonetheless.
[03:32.08]Mr. Hoon, thank you for the bits as well.
[03:34.24]Ilvery, thank you for the bits as well.
[03:36.36]Stream has gone off the fucking rails.
[03:39.18]This channel has no rails.
[03:40.82]It doesn't.
[03:41.87]I mean, sometimes it does.
[03:43.59]And right now, Harmony Core, thank you for the $5.
[03:45.45]Thanks for the horse pudding.
[03:48.03]You say that a lot.
[03:48.77]I have no idea what the fuck that means.
[03:50.25]All right, new game.
[03:50.91]The faculty thinks I've gone loopy, like some kind of spongy Mobius strip.
[03:55.94]That's why I'm here, isn't it, Dr. Decker?
[03:59.61]I can see people's dreams.
[04:01.37]I've set up an experiment.
[04:04.19]My dad is trying to hurt me.
[04:06.46]Quantum suicide.
[04:07.78]That person was a liar.
[04:08.72]Have you heard of it?
[04:10.62]I can see people's dreams.
[04:12.06]Liar.
[04:12.92]And I know when the person's going to be asleep.
[04:16.76]I can have the dream with them.
[04:18.42]That's not a lie.
[04:19.36]Let's call him God.
[04:21.17]He creates this world for his amusement.
[04:23.41]Something he can play with and occasionally alter to suit his mood.
[04:27.97]It feels like the paintings are watching me.
[04:31.99]Sometimes when I walk through a door, it takes me somewhere else.
[04:36.41]Why are all the new FMVs European, like British?
[04:38.93]God loves chaos, but something goes wrong.
[04:42.60]Man and woman evolve.
[04:44.76]What was once chaotic becomes, well, more ordered.
[04:49.65]It starts as a door-to-door saleswoman.
[04:52.29]Double-blazing, probably.
[04:55.41]Oh, shit.
[04:56.31]What the hell did I do?
[04:57.19]I, like...
[05:01.73]I'm late.
[05:02.33]This is just you guys talking to me every time.
[05:05.25]This is just you guys.
[05:07.49]This is you guys in chat.
[05:08.83]I'm just late again.
[05:12.69]Who are you?
[05:29.77]Doctor.
[05:30.91]What?
[05:31.20]You're late.
[05:32.14]Okay, I am.
[05:32.76]And after all those promises.
[05:34.94]Never mind.
[05:35.52]Let's not keep the patients waiting.
[05:37.40]And if you want anything, just... Oh.
[05:41.47]Sorry, I forgot.
[05:43.27]I'm not going to be here.
[05:45.29]The police still have some questions they want to ask about, you know.
[05:50.52]Interesting shot composition, by the way.
[05:53.52]They're showing her, like, hair and her fucking teeth and shit.
[05:57.29]Pull the camera back, like, 30 feet, dude.
[05:58.73]Good.
[06:02.73]Anyway, I hope you're all caught up on Dr. Decker's tapes.
[06:06.02]I think Mariana is in first.
[06:07.66]What the fuck is going on with this camera?
[06:09.24]I'm sure they'll all become a blur by the end of the day.
[06:12.92]I'll see you later.
[06:13.86]Or tomorrow.
[06:15.55]Good shot of her shoulder.
[06:16.79]Probably tomorrow.
[06:17.85]I'll leave it to you then.
[06:18.81]Okay.
[06:27.08]So, I believe this game.
[06:28.80]Patient names have dots next to them.
[06:30.32]Red equals keep talking to them.
[06:32.79]Amber is you're done.
[06:34.77]The continue button appears when all patients are amber.
[06:36.81]Green, you've asked everything.
[06:37.99]Going green is optional.
[06:39.99]Well, it is.
[06:40.61]It is optional, but, I mean, you should go green.
[06:42.75]You should be recycling.
[06:43.99]Watch replays in the responses tab.
[06:45.64]Look for stars.
[06:46.42]Important conversations.
[06:47.56]Optional conversations.
[06:48.56]Stars update automatically.
[06:52.90]Alright, I've
[06:56.38]Bryce, Claire, Ellen, Mariana, or Nathan.
[07:00.68]Type your question here.
[07:03.27]Who am I on and why are they ghosts?
[07:04.91]Let's go to Bryce.
[07:08.25]Yeah, this is Bryce.
[07:14.59]No, sorry.
[07:21.20]Okay.
[07:25.00]How are you today?
[07:28.02]I don't have anything for you.
[07:32.45]Like... Okay, go back.
[07:40.20]Patience, your notes.
[07:41.94]All right, how do I... I missed the story here.
[07:54.84]Let's go right to the... Let's go right to the deep shit.
[07:57.06]You know what I mean?
[07:57.70]Like you're not listening.
[08:07.46]What am I supposed to be doing here?
[08:17.23]Hello, Doctor.
[08:17.95]Hi.
[08:18.27]It's nice to meet you.
[08:19.09]Okay, hi, Works.
[08:20.09]Hi.
[08:20.27]What are you...
[08:23.64]What did you do today?
[08:27.40]No.
[08:28.24]Sorry.
[08:29.22]No.
[08:29.60]Sorry.
[08:32.72]I feel really bad.
[08:37.30]I can't answer your questions.
[08:38.38]Well, I can't... I like animals.
[08:41.56]You like animals.
[08:42.24]Let's talk about that.
[08:42.76]Okay, let's talk about animals.
[08:43.64]We're on the right track here.
[08:45.81]Dogs or cats?
[08:48.69]I don't know.
[08:49.43]Sorry.
[08:50.02]No, you just said you're into animals.
[08:51.14]You like animals, okay?
[08:52.32]Animals are nice.
[08:53.80]I love animals.
[08:55.98]Oh, yeah, I love animals.
[08:56.94]Especially cats.
[08:57.46]Especially cats.
[08:58.10]Okay, cats.
[08:58.68]I think everyone is either a cat person or a dog person.
[09:01.76]Literally what I just asked you.
[09:02.81]What do you talk to?
[09:03.27]I just fucking asked you that question.
[09:04.85]Just asked you that question.
[09:12.25]Therapist thing.
[09:13.89]Maybe.
[09:20.22]I don't know.
[09:20.86]I feel like I'm the weakest link or something.
[09:23.94]Alright, let's take a look at some notes.
[09:31.22]Use yes or no in answering questions.
[09:36.36]Find out what's wrong with them and see what they know about Decker.
[09:38.62]Alright.
[09:44.27]Yes, I can talk about all of that.
[09:46.39]What do you want to talk about first?
[09:55.81]I'm really bad at this, aren't I?
[09:58.19]Ask me something else.
[09:59.35]How tall was he?
[10:06.92]I don't have any kids.
[10:07.84]I'm talking about him, not you.
[10:08.90]Maybe I will one day, I don't know.
[10:10.90]At the moment, all my energy is focused on taking care of my patients.
[10:16.88]Yes.
[10:17.18]I haven't really got anything to say about that.
[10:20.42]Maybe we should talk about you.
[10:22.93]Sure.
[10:26.15]Let's go to Nathan for a second.
[10:27.95]Notes.
[10:31.51]We haven't talked to this guy yet.
[10:37.02]How did you know Decker?
[10:38.50]Dr. Decker was a complex man.
[10:40.98]I spent a lot of time with him.
[10:42.62]Okay.
[10:43.42]He won't remember it that way.
[10:45.18]Why?
[10:45.32]Why?
[10:48.53]Why?
[10:49.29]I don't know.
[10:50.19]Sorry.
[10:52.41]You gotta give me something, man.
[11:01.84]I saw the conflict that Dr. Decker was going through.
[11:05.02]Let's just say you might look back on your life and think there's nothing you would have done differently.
[11:10.22]No two days were alike for him in the end.
[11:13.11]Like, he couldn't decide what to do with himself.
[11:20.13]You asked me that yesterday.
[11:21.37]I didn't have an answer for you then either.
[11:22.95]Did you kill him?
[11:27.91]I don't know anything about it.
[11:29.05]Okay, hold on.
[11:41.18]Turn on subtitles?
[11:42.24]Okay, I thought they should be on.
[11:44.87]Okay, I got 1% progress.
[12:01.23]Okay, let's get a hint here.
[12:15.16]Okay, let's use a hint.
[12:16.46]Let's just get... Let's get a hint.
[12:21.26]I should ask her to tell me about Dr. Rutger.
[12:28.49]I've known a lot of doctors over the years.
[12:31.39]Most of them arrogant idiots who think nurses are just there to do their bidding or worse.
[12:37.23]Dr. Decker was different.
[12:39.97]Had a lot of time for me.
[12:41.66]0% overall.
[12:42.08]He was interested in my problems.
[12:45.02]This is a horror game.
[12:46.66]No.
[12:46.82]20 questions.
[12:47.34]What did I do?
[13:00.73]He was a bit offbeat, but... Ask her on a date.
[13:03.11]Yeah.
[13:04.01]I liked him.
[13:05.89]But then, I like most people.
[13:07.71]Okay, this is like... Let's just jump right to the inappropriate shit.
[13:23.96]Is that something I should know about?
[13:27.95]Yeah, all right.
[13:29.39]I wouldn't I would all right.
[13:31.25]I really I would yeah, I would Glass the guy.
[13:37.31]All right, let's open it.
[13:38.51]I got it.
[13:39.17]That's a police quest swat No, sorry I Don't have an answer to that question
[13:55.70]Okay, well, this is like some other time, maybe.
[13:57.92]I don't know.
[14:01.20]There are only 208 responses.
[14:02.19]All right, let's just... Okay, let's just... Let's move out of there for a sec.
[14:12.47]Just give me one second.
[14:13.31]We're going to move on.
[14:16.70]This one should be pretty easy to set up.
