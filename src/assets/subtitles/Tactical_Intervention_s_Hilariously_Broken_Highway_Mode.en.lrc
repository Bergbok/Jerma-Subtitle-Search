[00:09.71]It's just- it's just showing us the scenery.
[00:12.47]Yeah, why is it just- okay, here we go.
[00:15.27]Oh god, it's so loud.
[00:16.37]Why is it so loud?
[00:17.27]I know, why did it, like, re-loud itself?
[00:19.00]And now you're- you're wicked loud again.
[00:23.42]You are so loud.
[00:26.62]I guess I'm ready.
[00:31.20]Let me try and change my volume again.
[00:33.02]This is the loudest game ever.
[00:36.74]Oh my god, I'm driving.
[00:38.01]Are you driving?
[00:38.61]I'm in your car.
[00:40.90]Are you behind me?
[00:41.54]Yeah, I'm behind you.
[00:49.28]We're taking the secret highway route.
[00:52.34]What?
[00:53.02]Everything is so loud.
[00:54.90]You are so loud.
[00:56.26]You are so loud right now.
[00:59.54]I'm sorry.
[01:00.28]Your microphone is so fucked.
[01:03.16]Hey, look at this car.
[01:05.25]I missed.
[01:06.49]I can't control this.
[01:07.99]You just... What is the objective?
[01:14.14]I'm passing out.
[01:16.20]I'm passing out, dude.
[01:17.72]Hold on.
[01:18.68]Hold on a second.
[01:20.04]Oh, my God.
[01:22.62]Dude.
[01:28.12]This is do we get out?
[01:31.39]Oh
[01:56.43]What the fuck is this game?
[02:00.51]Hold on, I'm not ready.
[02:02.03]I'm not ready, I need to fix this audio.
[02:09.24]My mic says it's back down to like 20.
[02:12.25]Hold on.
[02:13.29]Options.
[02:13.73]Audio.
[02:15.09]Jeez, bring the master volume down.
[02:16.73]You're the driver.
[02:17.94]Wait, I'm driving.
[02:18.66]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:19.30]Come on.
[02:21.62]How do I drive?
[02:24.24]Watch out, this guy's behind us.
[02:25.84]How do I drive?
[02:26.82]This guy drives like a piece of shit.
[02:29.60]Yeah, yeah, it does a little bit.
[02:31.16]Why do you get arrows pointing?
[02:33.26]Yeah, why do I get the GPS?
[02:34.62]You didn't get the GPS.
[02:35.48]I'm getting out.
[02:36.86]Can I?
[02:37.50]What is...
[02:55.58]this is the hottest I've laughed in a long time I'm just watching some guy drive us
[03:10.82]This is the best thing ever.
[03:23.63]How's this guy doing?
[03:24.27]He looks like he's well and alive.
[03:26.19]He's just like looking at me just beeping.
[03:40.82]He had a... He had a blank expression.
[03:47.19]What the fuck?
[03:48.05]I'm... This...
[03:53.95]Oh, I'm just getting out!
[03:55.05]I'm done!
[03:55.57]Beings!
[03:56.11]That's the VIP!
[03:56.97]That's him!
[04:00.67]He's alive!
[04:04.21]He's alive!
[04:05.55]The VIP's alive!
[04:06.49]That makes no sense!
[04:10.92]His foot!
[04:11.50]Come here, Jerma!
[04:14.10]What's with his foot?!
[04:15.80]He's squashed in there!
[04:17.76]Oh my god!
[04:20.02]What the?!
[04:22.38]It's a game!
[04:23.78]I can't take it anymore.
[04:24.80]I gotta get out of here.
[04:25.64]Wait, what the hell?
[04:26.37]What's your name in here, Jeremy?
[04:27.51]You stole his car!
[04:31.07]Like, five people just gunned him down, like, surrounded him and just started firing.
[04:36.22]Alright, I'm driving.
[04:37.58]I'm going fast.
[04:38.52]I got the need for speed.
[04:41.40]Wait, wait, get out of the car.
[04:42.78]Get out of the car.
[04:43.60]Get out of the car.
[04:44.20]There's two of the same guy holding their feet on the car, on the dash.
[04:47.56]I'm stuck in this.
[04:48.22]Get me the... God, dude, it's car crash animation.
[04:50.67]Behind you, behind you.
[04:51.85]Just go look.
[04:52.97]Well, there's two of the same guy with the feet on the dash.
[04:55.91]He has his hand under his leg and his foot up and he's just like, I wanna go.
[05:00.45]Same guy.
[05:01.55]Look, and seriously, the HD face.
[05:05.59]I seriously am passing out.
[05:07.09]You see the spoiler on the back of that car?
[05:08.85]No, I'm too busy blacking out.
[05:11.83]It just threw us into this game.
[05:15.08]Seriously, we were at the ready screen, it got wicked loud.
[05:19.98]That was just too much stimulation of the brain.
