[00:03.02]Hey, I'm gonna do a wheelie.
[00:04.66]I'm just gonna let you laugh.
[00:27.82]Hey Jerma!
[00:29.04]Start game, private slots max.
[00:30.94]Jerma!
[00:31.66]Jerma!
[00:33.87]DERMA!
[00:38.19]What?
[00:40.19]Invite me.
[00:41.55]I haven't made the game yet!
[00:45.05]The- the- the Hemoglob-a-chopper is down here.
[00:47.03]Wow, I haven't played this game forever.
[00:48.41]We, uh, should- we definitely should not be running to this, by the way.
[00:51.56]Cause it's gonna take us ages.
[00:52.92]I'm just gonna get the Hemoglob-a-chopper.
[00:55.56]Hey, start, start, start.
[00:56.30]Can we take a plane?
[00:57.10]Hey.
[00:57.76]I dare you to turn around- GTFO in my closet wants to be my friend.
[01:00.42]I dare you to turn around and shoot Spoon with that shotgun.
[01:03.45]Hey!
[01:04.09]Hey!
[01:04.51]No!
[01:05.05]No!
[01:05.73]No!
[01:08.05]You flipped on my screen and just stood back up.
[01:10.42]Yeah, me too.
[01:11.08]Shoot Jerma.
[01:14.98]No, don't shoot me.
[01:16.08]Shoot Jerma.
[01:17.38]Shoot him in the back of the face.
[01:20.10]No, no, don't!
[01:21.10]He told me to!
[01:21.82]Yeah!
[01:23.96]What is this guy?
[01:26.01]Oh my god, that's a chopper.
[01:28.12]Oh, I wonder... Dude, there's like, there was like a friggin', hold on, I gotta look at this guy.
[01:32.90]This guy was in like winter clothing.
[01:36.85]Maybe it's winter.
[01:38.29]No, it's like nice out right now.
[01:39.77]This guy is in a full winter hat.
[01:42.59]That just whizzed by my screen.
[01:46.41]Alright, the game is on.
[01:47.95]No, I'm sorry, I hit the helicopter.
[01:50.05]Do you think you can get me in this car?
[01:53.51]Don't run me over!
[01:54.73]Oh no!
[01:56.45]I think I can get you, yeah.
[01:57.83]I didn't mean to do that!
[01:59.81]I'm so sorry, Spoon.
[02:02.53]Wait, you wanna run in the car and I chase you down onto Helichoop?
[02:05.21]Yeah, let's see if you can get me.
[02:06.69]Here, you can start going.
[02:07.79]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[02:09.77]Here we go.
[02:10.17]Oh god!
[02:24.49]Oh, you have it?
[02:25.36]Yeah, I got a chopper.
[02:26.06]You gotta get in the car, and you gotta escape the chopper.
[02:27.54]We're in one in the airfield.
[02:29.54]You're never gonna get me, because it's the best car in the game.
[02:32.16]Okay.
[02:32.50]I'm getting my own car.
[02:34.56]You're probably not gonna find one.
[02:37.26]I'm gonna find one.
[02:38.84]Just wait until I play the music in my head.
[02:41.66]Of me, like, chasing you down.
[02:42.95]How am I gonna hear it in your head, Jerma?
[02:44.81]Easy.
[02:47.37]I found a bike!
[02:49.21]Don't worry, I got this.
[02:50.07]Don't run me over!
[02:52.26]I'll throw another fit!
[02:53.88]Oh, jeez!
[02:55.38]I didn't hear the music!
[02:59.56]Oh, man.
[03:00.52]This is weird.
[03:02.24]Are you in the chopper right now?
[03:03.68]Yes.
[03:04.54]Oh, jeez.
[03:05.78]Oh, jeez.
[03:07.40]It's pretty weird to be in the chopper.
[03:12.18]He's going to crash without us even being there.
[03:14.92]Where are you?
[03:16.20]I'll do it.
[03:18.52]How high are you?
[03:19.24]Why are you that high in the air?
[03:20.48]I don't know, what do I do?
[03:22.24]Hold S, hold S. Hold S, S... No, no, no, don't hold... Don't hold it down the... Wow, I'm never listening to you again.
[03:30.75]I didn't mean to, like, hold S until you die.
[03:33.09]You said hold S. Yeah, but that means that's, like, how to, like, descend.
[03:38.45]Not, like, just hold it till I die.
[03:40.57]I'm ready for you to go.
[03:44.66]Here comes the chase scene.
[03:52.18]Why are you faster than me?
[03:53.38]This is not cool.
[03:53.96]This is not cool.
[03:56.06]I'm gonna get you.
[03:59.44]This is not cool.
[04:00.20]How are you faster than a helicopter going, THIS IS AN AIRPLANE!
[04:03.50]AHH!
[04:04.41]I was looking the other way!
[04:06.35]No!
[04:06.43]Am I still alive?
[04:08.19]I'm still alive!
[04:09.53]Here, I'll give you a ride back to the helicopters.
[04:11.35]Thanks.
[04:13.01]Get in.
[04:14.63]Or not.
[04:16.39]We're so bad at this.
[04:17.53]Every time we try to organize something and do something special...
[04:22.01]I'm gonna get the helicopter, and you guys just go anywhere.
[04:24.09]And I'll chase you for the rest of the time we're playing, and you will die.
[04:26.51]Yeah.
[04:28.16]Spoon, why are you on fire?
[04:29.32]Because I'm just cool like that.
[04:33.56]Ow!
[04:35.72]You want me to land on the ambulance?
[04:37.34]Yeah, try to land right on, like, the flat part of the ambulance.
[04:39.40]We need to, like, hang out.
[04:40.86]Even if I have, like, a teapotty on the top of the ambulance.
[04:49.65]What?
[04:50.53]That was so lame!
[04:54.11]That just looked like you jumped into bed.
[04:55.91]This is a mattress and you just like jumped into bed like, ah!
[05:02.37]That was so anti-climactic.
[05:05.06]No, no.
[05:07.70]Stop blocking me.
[05:08.52]Alright, you guys wanna have like a sumo wrestling fight up here?
[05:11.44]Yeah, sure.
[05:11.80]Whoever gets like knocked off the ambulance loses.
[05:15.34]Alright, Spoon, you ready?
[05:17.63]Oh shit.
[05:18.11]Oh shit!
[05:25.12]Get in, cousin.
[05:26.72]Please don't take Gatling gun helicopter.
[05:28.80]No, I didn't take the Gatling gun helicopter.
[05:30.50]You know what?
[05:30.78]You know what?
[05:32.42]No, please.
[05:33.12]No, please.
[05:33.76]It's my favorite.
[05:35.58]You ain't gonna get shit.
[05:41.01]Good job, cousin.
[05:42.37]I'm not sure you... Oh shit!
[05:46.06]Wrong button!
[05:46.86]Don't ask me that- don't- I don't understand how this makes any sense.
[05:50.62]It's still there.
[05:52.56]Why?
[05:52.98]I gotta destroy it!
[05:53.76]Why is it still there?
[05:54.96]I gotta destroy it!
[05:56.12]No, I gotta get rid of it!
[05:57.62]Why'd you destroy mine?!
[05:58.44]I'm going to get it!
[05:59.58]Come on!
[06:00.16]Yes!
[06:03.92]I got it!
[06:06.14]I am the victor.
[06:08.62]Alright, Spoon, I'm picking you up.
[06:11.39]No way, I got a helicopter.
[06:14.47]Is that?
[06:15.09]Oh, it's respawned, it's respawned, it's respawned.
[06:17.13]Operation, do not let him get it.
[06:18.55]Destroy it.
[06:20.63]I don't think you, I can't, I can't.
[06:22.69]I'm missing, I'm missing my line up here.
[06:24.87]He's dead.
[06:25.67]He's dead, crash into him.
[06:29.16]He's dead, crash into him.
[06:30.96]I'm on his tail.
[06:33.44]For Nico!
[06:37.16]Come here.
[06:38.90]We are seriously like birds fighting in the air.
[06:44.64]I'm gonna get you.
[06:45.70]It's gonna happen.
[06:46.54]No!
[06:47.00]You son of a... Air shot.
[06:51.88]I'm actually figuring out how to fly like this.
[06:53.49]You can actually control it.
[06:54.63]Oh my God.
[06:55.41]You got it?
[06:56.11]I just have to wait for it to turn.
[07:00.87]You are like a cheap $10 RC helicopter right now.
[07:06.08]Look at what I got for Christmas today.
[07:09.68]It's like, if I hold the trigger, when it turns in the direction I want to go, it moves that way.
[07:15.85]I can't believe you are still flying this thing.
[07:17.59]This is unbelievable.
[07:19.11]No, he's getting out of my view!
[07:21.43]I'm trying to follow him.
[07:24.07]Uh-oh, that was not, that was a bad move.
[07:25.81]What?! !
[07:30.54]Get him!
[07:30.96]Die!
[07:31.48]Get him!
[07:33.04]Die!
[07:33.56]He just... Did he crash?
[07:35.24]I had to reload.
[07:36.76]He's reloading.
[07:37.20]It doesn't tell you how much ammo you have in death.
[07:38.85]He's right here.
[07:39.29]He's right here.
[07:39.71]You got a chance.
[07:40.15]You got a chance.
[07:41.31]Niko, cover me.
[07:42.15]I'm reloading.
[07:43.27]Take cover.
[07:46.73]You're going down, Final Boss.
[07:48.95]Get him!
[07:51.65]I want to blow the... Oh, jeez!
[07:53.90]Oh, God!
[07:54.36]Run!
[07:54.98]Run!
[07:56.30]Oh no, I got hit by a car!
[07:57.63]Cousin!
[07:58.47]That was terrifying!
[08:00.85]And I got out!
[08:01.63]I'm out, I'm fine!
[08:03.65]Screw you!
[08:04.91]Die!
[08:05.87]Your car is an- Did you just jump out?
[08:10.10]Why did you do that?
[08:12.12]I thought I could land on the building and be fine, but my dick slammed into it and I kept falling.
