[00:09.40]Hey what is happening guys it is Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[00:13.24]This time I'm playing as the spy and the loadout for this match is going to be the big earner the new spy knife from the uber update, the ambassador and the default vanilla invisibility watch.
[00:25.37]I told you guys I promised you I'd get an invisibility watch gameplay that I wasn't just gonna do all dead ringer and here you go here it is I promised you so I'm gonna deliver on that.
[00:34.63]Also, we are playing on Payload Race High Tower, which was introduced in the Engineer update, and right off the bat here, I get two quick stabs.
[00:41.15]I thought for sure I was gonna be able to get at least three or four people right there, but that Heavy has some quick reflexes and puts me down six feet under.
[00:49.81]That is one of two deaths that occur during this gameplay, and I'll give you my quick assessment on the Big Earner, the knife that I'm using currently.
[00:57.56]I don't think it really works that well with the default invisibility watch or obviously the cloak and dagger the reason being because when you stab somebody the mechanic of this knife is when you backstab somebody or when you kill somebody I believe it's when you kill somebody as well you get 30% cloak and as you'll see right here I backstab this heavy but I have full cloak anyways it doesn't really matter and there's so many ammo cases when you're using the default invisibility watch
[01:21.01]that by the time you backstab your next victim, you're gonna have full cloak anyways, and it's not gonna do you any good.
[01:26.40]You're just losing 25 health.
[01:28.70]Now, with the Dead Ringer, though, this knife is incredible, because when you backstab somebody, if you use the Dead Ringer and you use the Latranja,
[01:36.57]or however you pronounce it, you'll be doing huge benefits to yourself because you'll backstab somebody, and if you turn around and shoot one person, you'll have full cloak to just use it again.
[01:46.36]You are pretty much invincible if you use the Dead Ringer, the Latranger, and this knife.
[01:52.29]As you just saw, I backstabbed that heavy with not a whole lot of cloak and I got a lot back.
[01:56.53]But that's pretty much the only time it happens in this whole gameplay.
[01:59.17]This is great here, I get these two snipers with two great headshots.
[02:02.59]That really helps the team out because now the cart can come through here, rather than having them pick off everybody that comes through this little corridor.
[02:10.22]So now I'm just trying to patrol the area, which you should be doing as a spy on these types of maps anyways.
[02:14.94]It's kind of your job just to patrol the area, make sure no one's lurking around somewhere.
[02:19.19]That's the best thing to do on this map, especially Hightower.
[02:21.73]So walking around, checking to see where people are, where the team is, where the other team is.
[02:25.45]It's kind of your duty as a spy to do these things.
[02:28.51]And I get up behind these guys, trying to pretend like I'm a sniper, switch my weapons a couple times.
[02:32.47]I get behind this heavy medic pair and it's doom.
[02:35.55]Doom and gloom for you two.
[02:38.95]Special guest appearance by Satan right there, so thank you, Satan.
[02:42.87]Anyways, I saw there was a Demoman there that I couldn't get behind.
[02:45.37]I probably would have fallen off the cliff if I tried to, so I got out of there quickly.
[02:49.18]And this is a great stab right here.
[02:50.38]This Pyro's kind of running sideways, and I get him with a little side stab.
[02:53.86]So thank you for coming, Mr. Pyro.
[02:56.76]Carts are looking pretty even right now, so I try to come back up these stairs.
[02:59.64]I'm gonna try and get a couple more headshots on the snipers that are up here.
[03:02.70]So, I think they wised up, though, because they're not there.
[03:06.28]So... If you're unaware, the Ambassador is the only other weapon in the game that can crit with a headshot.
[03:12.91]It's the only other weapon that can headshot, period.
[03:15.31]But that was a pretty big fail right there, so... I probably shouldn't have even went for the stab.
[03:19.29]I probably should have just backed off and went the other direction.
[03:22.54]But that's the only other time I die in the gameplay, so let's see what I can accomplish in the next two or three minutes, huh?
[03:29.93]Coming out of the respawn now, and I don't understand how this happens.
[03:33.15]You guys will see.
[03:34.25]I do a direct shot right in this medic's face.
[03:37.27]Like, it couldn't be any more perfect, and watch this.
[03:39.97]Doesn't register.
[03:40.71]Not even a hit.
[03:42.01]Not even a hit.
[03:43.61]I got him right in the face, too.
[03:45.23]Lag compensation for the win, huh?
[03:47.65]So anyways, I'm trying to get behind these guys.
[03:49.25]They know I'm around.
[03:50.07]That medic, they both die from the scout.
[03:52.11]So that was a pretty good part on the scout.
[03:54.22]So now just patrolling again, looking for somebody to kill, looking for somebody to maim.
[03:58.34]Come back up here.
[03:59.08]No snipers again.
[04:00.04]I thought for sure they would come back because look where the cart is.
[04:02.84]That is in a prime spot for snipers.
[04:04.86]And oh, Jerma forgot to hit the space bar.
[04:06.88]You got to do that when you jump.
[04:07.85]Don't forget that next time.
[04:09.45]So anyways, this is kind of how Hightower goes when you're a spy.
[04:12.60]You're going to do a lot of walking around.
[04:13.98]And when the carts are even like this in the spots where they are, you're going to do a lot of moving around, a lot of walking around, trying to find somebody.
[04:20.28]Thought about going for a shot, but I didn't.
[04:21.86]And now I'm thinking about time to go down here to the cart because nobody's here.
[04:26.20]So I jump down, gonna come over to the staircase here, and there's a little spy.
[04:29.08]I didn't know this before, because I'm an idiot and I herp derp all the time when I play spy.
[04:33.10]I did not know that you could jump up these crates and boxes, but I end up doing it.
[04:36.69]Missed the stab, but get it anyways.
[04:39.07]I come down here, there's a pyro that I try and do a side stab to, but I miss, and obviously as a spy you want to run like hell from a pyro that knows you're around.
[04:47.09]Jump down here, here we go, he's gonna come after me, I'm waiting for him.
[04:50.71]Boom, nice little shot, get the kill.
[04:52.83]Oh, am I gonna die?
[04:53.51]Nope.
[04:54.68]just barely miss bumping into the spy coming in who was doing the same thing I did trying to get health and some cloak so now we come up to the cart here I want to try and make this happen because nobody's pushing it really so me and this pyro get on it and I'm a cart spy now it's like heavy get down here like where are you going like come over here and get on the cart
[05:12.85]But anyways, this is now headshot mania right here.
[05:15.51]There's one.
[05:16.50]Don't get the kill.
[05:17.06]It doesn't matter.
[05:17.64]There's two.
[05:19.16]I get the assist for this, though, and now here comes another couple headshots on the snipers.
[05:22.70]Finally, the snipers ended up coming up to that roost.
[05:25.53]There's one, and do I get the kill?
[05:27.45]And there's a headshot kill right there.
[05:29.69]Now our team is just all pushing the cart.
[05:31.47]I figured that we have this in the bag.
[05:32.92]There's like four or five here.
[05:34.44]So I take a trip down here.
[05:35.74]I'm not going to cap it.
[05:36.56]There's no reason for me to be here.
[05:38.16]I'm going to try and pick off people that come out of the spawn.
[05:40.58]And nobody really comes out.
[05:41.64]They all go the other direction.
[05:42.74]So I kind of went the wrong way.
[05:43.88]But it's alright.
[05:44.58]We still do fine.
[05:45.92]So I come out of this window trying to find somebody.
[05:48.00]I can't shoot that guy.
[05:48.94]I can't shoot that guy.
[05:49.84]So I just go over to the right side of the spawn.
[05:51.88]And I end up getting a heavy.
[05:53.34]He just kind of comes out and he just bang gets him right there.
[05:56.64]That's going to be the end of the gameplay guys.
[05:59.32]Thank you all so much for watching, I really appreciate all the support you guys give.
[06:03.41]So I'll see you all next time, and take care everybody.
