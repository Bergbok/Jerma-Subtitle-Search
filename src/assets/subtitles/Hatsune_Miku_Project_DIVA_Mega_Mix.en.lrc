[00:04.59]Um, so I got it open here.
[00:06.47]Oh, there's no BRB music shit.
[00:09.13]That's my bad.
[00:11.26]Well, there will be BRB music in a second.
[00:14.90]Not my BRB music, but whatever BRB music you're about to hear.
[00:18.06]Um, I need to change the title, don't I?
[00:23.98]Where's Daffy?
[00:25.83]Um...
[00:28.01]I don't know anything about Miku.
[00:30.43]What do I title the game?
[00:31.99]Because, I mean, it won by a fucking landslide, so... Keep Where's Daffy?
[00:45.22]Where's Miku?
[00:47.44]Why would Daffy Duck be in this game?
[00:56.94]I'm going to put an honest title here, I think.
[01:01.27]I've never played a Miku game in my life.
[01:09.65]How about, I've never played a Miku game in my life.
[01:14.52]The VR one, that was not a Miku game.
[01:15.94]That was Space Channel 5.
[01:20.12]That wasn't a Miku game.
[01:23.75]What is the name?
[01:24.35]What's the title of this?
[01:26.35]Hatsune Miku Colorful Stage Project Diva Megamix Megamix Plus Project Diva Future Tone DX Project Diva Arcade Future Tone What game do I have?

[02:02.32]Okay.
[02:02.46]Let's go for it.
[02:05.28]Should I use a controller or a mouse?
[02:06.44]I feel like controller probably.
[02:07.78]Is it a rhythm game?
[02:13.55]It's controller?
[02:14.09]Okay.

[02:26.38]Recapture this window.
[02:27.70]Okay.

[02:49.11]Hold on.
[02:49.41]I need to re-add this.
[03:00.12]Where is it?
[03:00.46]What do you mean, looking for game to capture?
[03:06.50]It's here.
[03:13.30]It's right there.
[03:16.10]Oh my god, okay, there we go.
[03:17.05]Alright, what is, what is, full screen... With frame?
[03:27.93]No frame.
[03:28.79]What's that mean?
[03:30.61]I'm just going to do 1080.
[03:44.53]Alright.
[03:46.35]Let's go.
[03:50.37]We're looking.
[03:59.85]Hold on, I'm trying to move this thing.
[04:08.51]Clean your camera lens.
[04:13.77]There's nothing on it.
[04:16.91]There's nothing on it.
[04:18.31]It's fine.
[04:18.95]There's nothing on it.
[04:23.73]Okay, time for Miku, everybody.
[04:25.15]You ready?
[04:26.63]Ready?
[04:29.28]Put it in the dishwasher.
[04:31.88]Put it in the dishwasher.
[04:34.58]Okay, let's go.
[04:36.34]Is this a good enough volume?
[04:37.36]You want me to turn it up?
[04:38.97]This is really loud for me.
[04:40.05]Alright, so what do I do?
[04:44.07]What do you want me to do?
[04:44.73]What do I do?
[04:46.49]Rhythm game?
[04:47.11]Rhythm game?

[04:58.32]So how do I play?

[05:05.84]Alright.
[05:15.05]What?
[05:15.95]Wait, what?
[05:16.61]What was that?
[05:18.31]I-I- What do I have to do?
[05:21.87]Here comes the B icon.
[05:22.73]Press the corresponding button or key.
[05:28.07]What?
[05:28.37]Why is- what's with the left and right thing?
[05:31.34]Here comes the A icon.
[05:44.99]That was perfect.
[05:45.63]Shut up.
[05:57.28]Left or right?
[06:00.37]That's... Left is R. That's weird.
[06:02.37]I don't like that.
[06:03.17]That's weird.
[06:05.53]That's freaking me out.
[06:28.71]Sick.
[06:32.55]Are there any lyrics?
[06:43.24]Same time.

[08:15.74]As long as I want?
[08:24.23]Alright.

[08:41.36]They're waiting for me to start the song.
[08:46.24]And I'm just on stage like, dude, yeah, who's ready?
[08:52.77]It's like, geez, fucking hurry up, man.
[08:58.31]Like, let's go.
[09:03.93]When the rainbow icon shows up, that's your chance to spice up the music video.
[09:20.15]It's like a MIDI version of this song.
[09:22.93]What the fuck?
[10:02.93]Am I gonna get in trouble for streaming this audio?
[10:09.50]This is literally just songs.
[10:21.56]What?
[10:23.16]How is this wrong?
[10:23.86]It's me!

[10:58.85]I'm pressing- it's wrong?
[11:05.01]What are you talking about?
[11:09.97]You ignored the tutorial?
[11:11.51]No, I fucking didn't.
[11:13.63]The layout is set to the wrong controller.
[11:20.29]What?
[11:33.43]It thinks B is A. It thinks A is B. What?
[11:39.32]I just did the tutorial with it set to the right thing.
[11:42.04]What the fuck is it talking about?
[11:43.30]It's set to a Nintendo controller.
[11:52.38]What?
[12:01.80]No, I don't want to customize Miku, I want to customize my fucking controller!
[12:22.20]It was there?
[12:22.64]Where?
[12:39.42]What is all this?
[12:40.46]Y is Y. X is X. B is A.
[13:10.63]What the fuck was this all about?
[13:12.03]I literally just did the tutorial with these settings.
[13:15.05]Okay, I don't care.
[13:20.07]Okay, left is left.
[13:25.09]Right is left.
[13:26.97]No, right is right.
[13:30.13]Oh my god, dude.
[13:31.53]Oh my god.
[13:40.23]Shut up!
[13:41.19]Shut this fucking music up!
[13:43.29]I don't- What's going on?
[13:44.43]What?
[13:47.35]Multipress up plus left?
[13:49.51]What's happening?
[13:54.32]I'm so confused right now.
[13:56.40]Multipress up and left is Y and X. Um, huh?
[14:03.12]Unbind these?
[14:08.55]Up plus down, YA.
[14:12.84]This wasn't in the goddamn tutorial, dude.
[14:14.94]Can I leave now?
[14:26.57]I don't like that song anymore.
[14:51.27]Blackjack.
[14:55.35]Blackjack.
[15:00.32]Okay, let me see if I can actually play the game.
[15:01.90]Here we go.
[15:35.67]That's pretty good
[16:06.86]I think the tambourine sound is fucking with my head.
[16:14.87]I feel like I'm ruining the song.
[16:31.39]All this for one hand of blackjack.
[16:36.34]It's like three or four people at this table smoking cigarettes just like... So did you... did you bust or what?
[16:46.09]I'm sick of this.
[17:38.99]Oh, dealer had 20.
[17:40.15]You all lose.
[17:42.23]Try again.
[17:49.89]Alright, how do I turn off the tambourine?
[18:00.99]How do I turn the tambourine off?
[18:10.74]Button FX?
[18:12.26]Bell?
[18:13.32]Oh, okay.

[25:23.00]What the fuck?! !
[26:12.42]Here it comes, here comes the chorus.
[27:05.24]Next game... 80% of you said to play this!
[27:11.81]You're gonna have to fucking deal with the people in the chat that made me play this!
[27:29.21]And by the way, it's stellar.
[28:23.85]You're almost 40.
[28:47.76]Play the banana song.
[28:49.34]First I need to fucking fix this.
[28:53.25]I feel like I've been stuck in a dream for the last 25 straight minutes.
[28:57.45]Okay.
[29:01.51]Do you... No.
[29:03.79]How do I save?
[29:04.41]There's fucking changes.
[29:08.10]Oh my god, thank goodness.

[29:23.63]whoa hold on man alright alright alright let's go alright
[30:08.25]Mm-mm.
[30:39.88]I would go to a Miku concert.
[30:42.92]Do they serve alcohol at a Miku concert?
[30:46.51]Like, I would just get drunk and just like sit there and nod.
[30:49.19]Can you drink?
[30:49.65]Can you just serve alcohol?
[31:00.23]They don't?
[31:00.73]I feel like I'm talking over a vacuum cleaner.
[31:11.95]It's loud for me, hopefully it's not this loud for you.
[31:21.67]Yeah, I'd be like-
[31:38.86]I would be pissed off.
[31:40.89]Because I would definitely have like a few too many, right?
[31:43.95]And be pissed because I can't get up and dance.
[31:46.66]So I'd be just sitting there in the corner like this, just like...
[32:12.13]I wanna get up and dance so bad.
[32:50.92]This is a long song, isn't it?
[32:58.04]Somebody's leaning in now.
[33:00.32]Dude, you good?
[33:03.45]You good?
[33:03.91]Yeah.

[33:45.47]Alright, how about dermatology?
[34:13.21]Oh, that's cool.
[34:14.81]Do all the songs have their own kind of backgrounds?
[34:16.78]That's actually pretty cool.
[34:18.10]I like this.
[34:19.58]Alright.
[35:25.12]You guys know I thought Miku was a real person until, like, a year and a half ago?
[35:28.70]I thought it was a guerrilla scenario.
[35:31.89]Yeah.
[36:03.72]Here we go.
[36:35.45]I think I'm ready for Hard.
[37:17.07]One more time, one more time, let's go!
[37:55.32]Important notice, Hatsune Miku.
[37:57.42]Alcohol consumption is prohibited both inside the live venue and the exhibition hall.
[38:14.97]Alright, well then alright, alright.
[38:16.25]I don't need to-
[38:37.83]That's a lot of songs!
[38:39.77]Alright, okay!
[39:08.68]It's alright.
[39:27.23]Seven and a half difficulty, man.
[39:28.69]Are you serious?
[39:32.39]Oh, by the way, should I put- There's like flashing lights in this.
[39:34.87]Should I put a warning?
[39:39.11]Probably should.
[39:39.99]I'll put a warning in.
[39:44.89]Title.
[39:52.88]Morning.
[39:53.32]Flashing lights.
[39:54.14]There we go.
[39:57.34]Yeah, there's like really bright flashing colors and stuff.
[40:01.83]I'll put a warning in.
[40:02.71]There you go.
[40:11.66]Alright, hold on, I... I wasn't ready for that.
[40:20.95]Am I ready for hard?
[40:21.73]Do you think I can do hard?
[40:24.27]Turn the difficulty down.
[40:25.91]Oh shit, too late.
[40:32.51]Alright, is this everybody's favorite song of the whole game?
[40:35.05]Let's go, let's get perfect.
[40:48.18]Thanks for watching!
[41:18.89]Oh shit!
[41:22.27]The animal just hit!
[41:24.47]The animal just hit!
[41:25.89]Oh my god, that was fucking impossible!
[41:29.02]Maybe lower difficulty.
[41:36.04]Maybe a little bit lower of difficulty.
[41:41.94]No shit!
[41:42.92]Hold on.
[41:44.48]I can probably do it with one eye.
[42:00.31]Thanks for watching!
[42:56.42]Oh, yeah.
[43:28.17]Thank you for watching!
[43:53.05]If you want something that's not enough, you've met me, not me.
[43:55.67]And so I went ahead of you, even in the night when it's getting dark.
[44:00.06]Love the me that's not enough.
[44:01.78]You raised me while you were asleep.
[44:05.62]Can you see me?
[44:07.60]The loneliness disappears.
[44:09.48]Hey, even if you know me, you don't have to hold me anymore.
[44:16.79]Hey, if you know me, will you smile at me again?
[44:38.96]They turned it up!
[44:39.62]They like dialed it up!
[44:44.94]They turned it up!
[44:46.36]It was like I wasn't ready for it.
[44:57.08]Dude, your mic sucks.
[45:01.46]I know, man.
[45:25.25]This one sounds pretty good.
[46:16.22]I can't fucking do those.
[46:40.73]Thank you for watching!
[47:34.15]Thank you.
[48:23.03]Let's go!
[49:02.05]Oh, did I win?
[49:12.44]It's really hard.
[49:15.10]It's really hard.
[49:19.41]What's Megamix?
[49:31.65]What's the difference?
[49:32.15]I feel like this one's gonna be impossible.
[49:46.50]Start music video?
[49:50.45]How do I- Do I have to do the music video?
[49:51.79]Alright, let's go!
[50:05.23]Oh, my eyelid!
[50:09.75]Alright, how do I play?
[50:31.30]I'll do my own.
[50:32.70]I'll do my own rhythm game.
[51:07.74]Get me out of here.
[51:21.23]Where's the one that goes Where's that one?
[51:47.27]I just wanna know.
[52:02.38]I'm just curious.
[52:30.26]Auctioneer!
[53:17.80]Uh, I'm gonna do 100 bucks?
[53:19.38]I don't know if that's what you were saying.
[53:20.52]I don't know what to do there.
[53:37.05]That's all of them.
[53:41.07]This is from Clay Fighter.
[53:59.64]This is the Clay Fighter solo.
[54:02.60]The theme from Clay Fighter.
[54:34.37]I almost got smashed the controller!
[54:43.92]Settle down.
[54:54.09]No, I don't want to retry it.
[54:56.29]This microphone keeps breaking my sound.
[54:58.83]What does it sound like?
[54:59.57]Can I hear?
[55:01.48]Flip that.
[55:01.86]I want to see what that sounds like.
[55:04.36]The mic blew out.
[55:07.12]Why does the mic keep blowing out, man?
[55:10.44]I want to see what it sounds like.
[55:14.34]The edible really did hit, huh?
[55:15.70]It was right at the end of the song, too.
[55:19.72]That clip is not available anymore.
[55:21.12]Did I get fucking shut down?
[55:36.27]It does sound so fucked up.
[55:43.98]It's like... That's so funny.
[55:51.44]It sounds like such shit.
[55:54.83]It's very sudden, loud movements.
[55:57.57]It just goes, no.
[56:01.45]Okay, let's keep going.
[56:03.12]That's actually kind of a good thing, though.
[56:04.96]Because when I scream like a little shithead, it cuts it off, so you can't hear it.
[56:13.02]It protects you from hearing me sound like a little shit.
[56:18.86]Okay, let's go back to the song list.
[56:20.78]Okay, World is Mine and Po-Pi-Po.
[56:30.77]Alright, World is Mine and Po-Pi-Po.
[56:32.39]There are 178 songs.

[61:11.76]You know what it is?
[61:13.64]I'm too good for normal and not good enough for hard.
[61:17.12]Every rhythm game that has the button presses like this, it's always tricky for me.
[61:51.63]It's good to realize that your will is different from usual.
[61:56.57]It's good to look at the future together.
[62:01.00]These three words of mine will be translated into three words.
[62:06.74]If you understand, don't hold it in your right hand.
[62:13.50]What should I do?
[62:14.76]Even if you say you're selfish,
[62:25.68]From now on, I want you to be even cuter In this world, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen Hey, why are you making me wait?
[62:40.49]Who do you think I am?
[62:45.65]I want to eat something sweet

[63:54.30]What the fuck?
[64:03.92]Did I fail again?
[64:04.62]54 fucking percent, man.
[64:08.60]Oh, I'm too good for normal, too bad for hard.
[64:24.45]Intermediate.
[64:27.78]Intermediate.
[64:30.36]Alright, what's the name of that song that goes... Where is it?
[64:55.49]It's not air.
[65:03.13]It's not an L. Where is it?
[65:12.57]Shots with an I?
[65:28.56]Where is it?
[65:33.20]I need the DLC.
[65:35.52]It's not in the base game?
[65:36.64]What?
[65:36.82]That was the tutorial!
[65:38.26]Alright, what's another one?
[65:42.61]Oh, what was it?
[65:58.42]I did normal, but whatever.
[65:59.18]This is too easy!
[66:24.28]See?
[66:24.48]This is too easy, but hard is too hard for me.
[66:31.39]Be careful up there!
[67:11.65]I wish I could watch the music video with you.
[67:13.65]I'm too busy playing.
[67:46.39]Cool!
[68:09.67]From the beginning, I knew that you were here.
[68:18.60]All of my courage lit the fire and I can't run anymore.
[69:02.12]Oh, shit.
[69:04.44]The- this- Okay, listen.
[69:08.69]When they're on the- I can't talk because there's a fucking song playing.
[69:12.20]Okay, when it says the buttons you need to press and they're like- My eyes have to go frog eyes to see the button palms.
[69:26.15]What buttons do you press?
[69:27.35]Press these buttons together.
[69:28.91]It's like, I have to go like this because they're on the very edges of the screen.
[69:32.29]Alright.
[69:50.84]So are there different songs?
[69:51.90]Oh, there are different songs.
[69:59.96]We got glow sticks now, by the way.
[70:02.14]Rolling girl.
[70:15.58]We got glow sticks.
[70:16.40]If you want to use them, go for it.
[70:28.96]Why do I feel like this is what caffeine sounds like in your bloodstream?
[70:59.97]Let's crank it.
[71:06.47]Let's crank it.
[71:13.59]Let's crank it.
[71:29.78]Whoa.

[71:34.32]She's punching shit.
[71:35.56]She's punching the wall.
[71:38.14]What was that?
[71:44.67]She just smashed her bare hand on a music stand.
[71:52.68]That would hurt.
[71:53.12]That would fucking hurt.
[72:33.98]It's so funny, I can half pay attention to the music video.
[72:40.48]We're in a different location.
[73:04.72]Fucking cross-eyed.
[73:18.33]Where are we now?
[73:18.80]Is it the Kingdom Hearts stairs?
[73:44.38]They look like Kingdom Heartsters.
[73:48.60]That was pretty good.
[73:52.10]I almost failed it, but that was a fun one.
[73:53.78]I like that one.
[73:58.85]Alright, how about, like, how about five more?

[85:49.52]I unplugged the mic for a second, it's okay.
[85:55.42]That was cool, I like that song.
