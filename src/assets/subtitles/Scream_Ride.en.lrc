[00:05.73]So something you need to keep in mind is that at some point somebody thought this coaster might have been a good idea and Is charging people money for it?
[00:16.23]This costs money This costs money The ride just kills you
[00:30.69]Why would you ever fucking ride this ride?
[00:38.60]What kind of mess of coils did I just make down here?
[00:46.88]If one person survives this, I'll be surprised.
[00:50.24]I'll be shocked if there's one person sitting still on this roller coaster.
[00:56.50]Looks like you just crushed up a fucking soda can and put it on the track.
[01:02.81]Let's see what happens.
[01:05.77]We still haven't lost it.
[01:06.95]Oh, yeah, we have... Shit!
[01:09.85]Fuck, no, no, no!
[01:17.52]What is with the building?
[01:18.44]The building is fucking collapsing.
[01:22.22]What?! !
[01:24.92]I didn't do that!
[01:26.10]Oh my fucking god!
[01:31.15]I can't imagine a world where this actually will work.
[01:35.31]I mean, I'm on this human blender thing really badly.
[01:39.51]But, I don't think there's gonna be enough speed.
[01:42.92]To make the person smoothie that I wanna make.
[01:44.78]Here we go!
[01:47.70]Holy shit, it's actually working!
[01:54.76]Oh, come on, keep going!
[01:56.32]Get to the top!
[01:58.72]Get to the top!
[02:01.24]Come on!
[02:03.46]Come on, my creation!
[02:04.84]Yes!
[02:08.39]It worked!
[02:15.83]Wooo!
[02:21.75]It just, like, throws the people.
[02:23.69]Look at the G-Force, dude!
[02:26.00]That's 28 G-Force!
[02:30.92]You- your bones would fucking probably break at that high of G-Force.
[02:38.60]Alright, let's start like a fucking new bowling team.
[02:42.25]The people are the fucking pins!
[02:46.39]Oh, wow, that's... Okay, that's not...
[02:52.39]Oh I can actually see this running away screaming!
[02:57.23]Get away from the giant hamster!
[03:00.83]You don't think I know how to do a god damn good bowling?
[03:06.29]There it is!
[03:06.63]Alright get him!
[03:12.51]That's not what I wanted.
[03:17.23]That's not what I wanted.
[03:19.09]If this ends up actually working then I'm going to probably laugh.
[03:23.64]What a piece of crap structure.
[03:34.32]That is not safe for anyone to go near.
[03:38.20]Considering that I just tapped it with a bowling ball and it fell down.
[03:43.43]Look at these tiny little helicopters.
[03:45.13]Are you serious?
[03:45.81]There's no way I'm gonna be able to hit one of these.
[03:49.28]You need to be, like, so precise.
[03:51.46]Alright, I'm just gonna do the level.
[03:53.45]There'll be more of that dumb shit later.
[03:54.93]Bang!
[04:02.97]Oh, yeah!
[04:08.80]I took off.
[04:09.60]I, like, chipped the building's tooth.
[04:12.77]Alright, so we got a ride here.
[04:14.33]I'm gonna break it down for you.
[04:16.27]Here we go.
[04:17.25]Starting on the Stegosaurus spine.
[04:19.07]That takes you all the way up to the underjay.
[04:21.17]You're gonna go underneath this mess.
[04:22.73]Look at, whoa, just barely hitting that coaster, but you don't.
[04:25.04]Over the camel hump, down to a death-defying 90 degree super drop.
[04:29.50]And then what happens?
[04:30.22]Holy shit, we're upside down.
[04:32.02]You're gonna go upside down through the shoelace.
[04:34.52]The shoelace is the most important part.
[04:35.98]That's where everybody pukes.
[04:37.64]Not one person is not thrown up at that part of the ride.
[04:40.00]You're gonna go over and under, down towards the Spindy Doodle.
[04:43.15]The Spindy Doodle is patented.
[04:44.75]I actually went through the patent office and got this patented, so don't fucking steal it.
[04:48.57]Down through the Pretzel.
[04:49.55]Pretzel is another part of the ride that I'm very proud of, because no one's ever made a Pretzel roller coaster before, and that takes you to the end of the ride.
[04:54.93]That's the scent of the scent.
[04:56.67]That's the scent.
[04:58.01]Yeah, the ride stinks.
[05:01.20]Yeah, this is the best roller coaster ever!
[05:04.76]I love- Oh my god!
[05:06.42]I can't even tell what's happening!
[05:18.60]Sorry, I better be getting people to sign a waiver to ride this next coaster.
[05:24.05]Because, I mean, you're guaranteed to die on this coaster.
[05:28.86]There's no, you don't live.
[05:31.36]You don't go to a theme park and see this and say, that's what I want to ride unless I also want to be dead.
[05:41.18]Here we go.
[05:44.56]First you gotta go up the speed boosts.
[05:48.15]There's the first jump.
[05:58.99]I told you!
[05:59.67]I told you!
[06:03.41]Ah, what a beautiful day.
[06:06.06]Cascading waterfalls, beautiful wildlife forestation, and the sun shining down on all of us.
[06:14.02]God, I love it out here.
[06:16.34]I especially love the silly string ride.
[06:20.59]Go for it!
[06:21.21]Right off the bat, that guy's stuck in the coaster.
[06:25.95]That guy is seriously lodged inside of the coaster.
[06:30.67]I can't believe this is actually working.
[06:32.51]I seriously cannot believe this works.
[06:34.73]How have we not crashed yet?
[06:37.30]Is there anybody even left in the ride?
[06:40.52]No, it's an empty ride.
[06:42.22]It's an empty ride.
[06:42.76]There are no human beings in that ride right now.
[06:45.44]They're all gone.
[06:49.11]I'm going to manually drive around my coaster to keep everybody on the ride.
[06:58.37]I should be able to do this.
[07:01.23]I just want to get to the end.
[07:03.03]That's all I want.
[07:05.71]When you control the coaster, it weaves around.
[07:08.08]Okay, this is difficult here.
[07:10.66]These are boosters.
[07:12.82]No, I can't control that.
[07:14.44]I'm holding the breakdown right now.
[07:15.68]It doesn't even matter.
[07:16.26]I put way too many boosters here.
[07:18.11]See you later.
[07:18.49]I'm gone.
[07:19.33]I'm going to fly off right now.
[07:20.53]Yeah, I knew it.
[07:33.83]Ah!
