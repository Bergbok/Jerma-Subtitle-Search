[00:02.73]I'm so glad that I got killed by a Default Demoman.
[00:05.67]Alright, say Default Demoman as fast as you possibly can.
[00:08.61]Default Demoman.
[00:10.33]No, it has to be like Default Demoman.
[00:12.20]Let's be perfect.
[00:13.60]Default Demoman.
[00:14.62]Default Demoman.
[00:15.38]Default Demoman.
[00:17.68]Default Demoman.
[00:18.68]This almost sounds like I'm going to have to put effort into it.
[00:21.30]Default Demoman.
[00:22.96]Default Demoman.
[00:24.73]Give it a little bit.
[00:29.11]I'm going to do this.
[00:37.70]That's wrong with me.
[00:39.26]No, get away from me, PJ!
[00:41.64]Oh, you were... Oh, sentry?
[00:55.55]You want to get sentried?
[00:56.99]Son of a bitch!
[00:58.37]Get...
[01:00.98]Oh my god.
[01:02.42]Rampage.
[01:04.61]Just another sentry gun.
[01:07.38]God, there's so many sentry guns.
[01:08.68]This game sucks.
[01:11.89]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[01:13.07]Jerma here.
[01:13.73]Covenant Piss right now.
[01:14.47]Covenant Pea.
[01:14.89]Covenant Pooh.
[01:15.47]We're going to be doing a live commentary right here.
[01:17.69]Playing on the map CP.
[01:20.49]It's a good gravel pit.
[01:21.61]Got Mrs. Buttsack.
[01:22.51]Got to be healing me for this round.
[01:24.03]Got to be live shellcasting, like I said.
[01:25.59]And here we go.
[01:26.31]Got the first point here.
[01:26.87]We got a sniper coming around the corner.
[01:27.89]We got B. Now the A is being captured.
[01:29.49]Now B is being captured.
[01:30.39]I got the quick fix Uber right here.
[01:31.63]Trying to get this pyro off the point.
[01:32.71]I get him.
[01:32.98]Oh, didn't get this shot on the back.
[01:33.98]Another demoman comes up to the side.
[01:35.38]It's unfortunate that he was not able to get through here.
[01:37.08]There's a sentry gun here, too.
[01:38.58]Sentry gun's in a really stupid, dumb place.
[01:40.14]But it's okay.
[01:40.76]Let's keep going here.
[01:41.62]I wanna- I took this part of the live showcast out because I didn't like it very much.
[01:46.30]So it is- I lost that medic right there, but it's okay.
[01:48.92]We got a teleporter over here.
[01:49.78]We got- Oh my goodness gracious.
[01:51.02]Ladies and gentlemen, we got the teleporter down.
[01:52.04]We got the engineer down as well.
[01:53.62]Jerma seems to know what he's doing here.
[01:56.20]Uh, oh, now he's at spawn.
[01:57.90]What the fuck is he doing at spawn?
[01:59.52]Ladies and gentlemen, he's doing some really crazy stuff right here.
[02:02.58]He's got a- You kept that going.
[02:07.10]Huh?
[02:07.96]For a really long time.
[02:19.47]Where the fuck did he come from?
[02:23.26]How am I still alive?
[02:25.14]I'm just, like, whipping this guy.
[02:29.68]You wanna get whipped?
[02:34.08]Oh my god.
[02:35.71]How many people can I whip?
[02:37.29]Let's find out.
[02:38.59]Let's find out how many people I can actually kill with the whip.
[02:41.37]Here comes the scout.
[02:42.67]Here we go.
[02:45.59]Oh, no, here goes Pyro.
[02:47.25]No Medic!
[02:49.36]Dammit.
[02:52.56]Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, coming around the corner.
[02:54.00]He sees a sniper, a Huntsman sniper, by the way, which is something that hits in the beta.
[02:57.18]It's a crit, a crit rocket guy hanging on the side of the wall there.
[02:59.78]We've got some really important things going on.
[03:01.68]There is a soldier up top here.
[03:03.69]One shot with the direct hit does not get the kill.
[03:06.53]One shot...
[03:09.59]Trying to do a shoutcast, and it gets ruined.
[03:12.77]And did you see that air shot?
[03:14.31]Ladies and gentlemen, we'll just get right into this here.
[03:16.59]Another Demoman ran a quick fix.
[03:17.79]Uber, is he going to get the Demoknight right there?
[03:19.23]Gets one shot, two shots.
[03:20.46]Here he comes around the corner, gets the shotgun.
[03:22.10]One, two, and a three.
[03:23.52]Third time's a charm.
[03:24.20]Pyro going after the medic.
[03:25.10]He gets it.
[03:25.50]One shot, two shot, three shot.
[03:26.54]Does not get the kill.
[03:27.08]Gets the medic.
[03:27.68]He's got to get that whip attack.
[03:29.64]Yes!
[03:31.26]That is so... You know what?
[03:32.88]Let's just stop right here.
[03:34.18]Can I just say this?
[03:35.68]If you can do that...
[03:37.42]You are talented.
[03:38.62]You just really are.
[03:39.39]Because I don't know how people continue to, you know, heavy.
[03:42.13]Just fucking die.
[03:43.81]Oh my god, I'm terrible.
[03:47.25]Come here.
[03:48.87]What?
[03:49.47]Oh boy.
[03:52.56]You know, fine.
[03:53.62]Oh my god.
[03:58.28]Ow, my butthole!
[04:01.30]What?
[04:11.10]Is there something wrong with this engineer?
[04:12.68]Like, what is going on?
[04:13.64]Why... What are you doing?
[04:17.36]We have a point to cap, you know.
[04:19.78]We have to go over there and get this point.
[04:22.56]No, I... Sir?
[04:23.84]Sir, excuse me.
[04:25.10]Sir.
[04:26.40]You have to go that way and cap the point.
[04:28.76]I'm done with you.
[04:29.44]Let's see how...
[04:37.13]You see?
[04:37.53]You see what happens?
[04:39.15]You see what happens when you don't do that?
[04:46.05]You wanna step inside for the next Game of Thrones?
[04:51.26]It's gonna be so much fun on the next Game of Thrones.
[04:54.94]You have this song style that you always, always go back to.
[04:59.12]And if you were, like, actually, like, an artist, like, a musician, you would be the worst.
[05:07.96]Why do you say that?
[05:10.13]I'm gonna go to the next Game of Thrones!
[05:14.61]You're always so excited about like nothing.
[05:17.29]That's a theme.
[05:17.91]That's like the general theme song music.
[05:21.63]Have you ever heard like a theme song from anywhere in the 80s or 90s?
[05:25.83]Holy shit, did you see this pyro?
[05:29.24]Every theme song in the 80s and 90s had a motto.
[05:32.50]Like, for instance, we were moving on up to the east side.
[05:36.78]That was the song's motto.
[05:40.38]And it said it like three or four times in the exact same tone.
[05:44.05]Right?
[05:44.95]Yeah.
[05:45.39]Here's another one.
[05:46.91]Oh, yeah.
[05:50.57]Charles in charge.
[05:54.99]Like, Charles in charge.
[05:56.09]Come on.
[05:57.19]You know what I'm talking about.
[05:58.13]I do know what you're talking about.
[05:59.43]So that's why, when you say... When I'm like... You better step inside for the next Game of Thrones!
[06:05.06]Like, the next Game of Thrones... Is the motto of the theme song.
[06:10.52]The Otto?
[06:11.72]No.
[06:12.24]The motto.
[06:14.22]Otto?
[06:14.56]No!
[06:16.73]There's a pirate just standing there, like, hitting this engineer at spawn.
[06:20.37]With... What the fuck is... Hold on, what the... What was that?! !
[06:28.53]Why did the whole earth just rotate, like, a hundred miles per hour?
[06:31.87]The shadow... Is that, like, a bug?
[06:33.45]What the hell just happened?
[06:34.73]Where the shadows, like, move across the ground?
[06:36.50]Yeah!
[06:37.10]Yeah, that's actually a pretty common bug.
[06:39.58]I've never seen that before.
[06:41.10]That was ridiculous.
[06:43.92]It looked like somebody was, like, speed hacking above me.
[06:45.85]Alright, let's see how long it takes for me to get headshot here.
[06:53.69]Okay, that didn't take long at all.
