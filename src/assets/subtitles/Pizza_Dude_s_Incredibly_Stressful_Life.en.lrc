[00:38.71]How did you- Where'd you get that from?
[00:40.19]Like, oh my- What the hell?

[01:44.13]What is even going on?!
[01:46.26]Stop falling off!
[01:48.32]You stupid punk!
[01:51.88]Uh, that's probably why, because I keep on doing that.
[01:56.54]Oh, it's gotta go all the way over there?
[01:58.32]Alright, step on it.
[02:00.58]Step on the gas.
[02:11.30]Nice and easy.

[02:24.12]What the hell are you talking about?
[02:26.33]What?
[02:28.69]What the fu- How- Who delivers a pizza to a boat and puts like, oh, I know how we can fuck with this guy.
[02:35.74]We're gonna put platforms of boxes that he has to jump on.
[02:40.12]What kind of a dickhead do you have to be?
[02:44.91]Tomato.
[02:47.23]Yeah, you got it.
[02:48.76]Tomato, we got.
[02:51.04]Salad.
[02:52.52]You want some pineapple?
[02:54.78]There it is, pineapple.
[02:57.02]Delicious.
[02:58.21]Fresh from the garden.
[03:01.19]Would you also like some rotten fucking tomatoes?
[03:04.61]Alright, this one, 25 seconds.
[03:06.59]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[03:08.17]Not messing around on this one.
[03:10.19]Do not walk into any- Oh, it's right here.
[03:11.77]Good.
[03:12.99]Perfect.
[03:13.68]Speed it up.
[03:14.50]Don't run into anything.
[03:15.76]Alright, here we are.
[03:20.02]I wish you could break.
[03:20.84]That would be nice if you could get off.
[03:22.38]Get off!
[03:25.24]Four- Three seconds!
[03:28.03]Get- What?! !
[03:31.85]Oh, yes, I'd like some tomato, some cheddar cheese, a little bit of your rotten peppers from your garden, some pineapples and maybe a little bit of the ham from the chainsaw that you got from Jason.
[03:45.71]Jason 2, actually.
[03:46.95]Yeah, that's my favorite movie.
[03:48.67]And also, I would like some more of your... Did I even say tomatoes yet?
[03:52.49]I probably did.
[03:53.33]I already forgot the joke.
[03:54.83]Go, go, turn around.
[03:57.40]If I get stuck, I did that.
[03:59.16]Oh, you want to go on some stairs?
[04:00.38]Go.
[04:02.16]This one's going to like a gas station.
[04:05.10]10 seconds.
[04:06.14]Slow it down.
[04:07.00]Slow it down here.
[04:07.68]Slow it down here.
[04:08.24]Slow it down.
[04:15.63]Yes!
[04:18.63]I did it.
[04:20.75]I didn't do it.
[04:22.61]I didn't do it.
[04:24.73]I didn't do it!
[04:27.25]And why does the resolution keep changing?
[04:30.35]It keeps going from 1920x1080 to 800x600.
[04:35.59]I'm sorry, guys.
[04:36.45]I apologize.
[04:37.31]This video... The video settings are all over the place.
[04:40.26]Like, right now it's in 800x600.
[04:42.54]Why?
[04:42.84]And why are they fucking blow-up dolls?
[04:48.12]I would actually like to complete one of these missions.
[04:50.05]That would be nice.
[04:52.39]That would be real nice if I could actually finish one of these missions.
[04:56.88]And not lose every time.
[04:58.77]I don't even think the game's completable.
[05:01.75]Get, don't, get the fuck out of the way, car.
[05:04.89]I got pizzas to deliver.
[05:06.11]There we go.
[05:09.31]I remember this one.
[05:10.01]This is the one with like the stairs that you can't go up.
[05:13.42]No, no, this is the one back here, back here.
[05:14.58]I remember.
[05:15.64]Seven seconds.
[05:16.46]I got this.
[05:18.84]Done deal.
[05:20.34]Nice.
[05:20.86]I actually completed one.
[05:23.02]Can you believe it?
[05:24.20]What?
[05:24.34]Is this dog attacking me?
[05:28.41]This dog looks like a fucking pig!
[05:30.23]He doesn't even look like a dog!
[05:33.17]Get outta here!
[05:35.91]Look, I'm gone.
[05:36.65]I left your territory.
[05:40.45]Is this, like, pig-goat thing gonna just keep following me down the street?
[05:47.34]I'm trying to just go back to the restaurant, and you are just making things way too difficult for me.
[05:53.02]What the hell's going on?
[05:54.54]What's happening?! !
[06:03.66]Okay.
[06:05.02]This is normal.
[06:05.76]Yeah, that was totally normal.
[06:09.49]And he's still chasing me!
[06:14.35]I need some gas, excuse me, I'd like some... Yes, yeah, I need some gasoline for my car, I need a little bit of gas.
