[00:06.95]Well, that's good.
[00:09.59]Button 11 is jump.
[00:10.01]Button 2, what are those?
[00:10.77]Oh.
[00:10.85]Why am I taking advice from rats?
[00:11.65]And why are they, why can they talk?
[00:28.83]It's all about the speed, dude.
[00:31.01]See, look at that.
[00:31.95]Just don't, just gotta move.
[00:33.97]Same exact thing I would say about Super Meat Boy.
[00:36.17]He's like super crazy, like hard, like unforgiving platformers.
[00:39.58]You just gotta go.
[00:41.12]You just gotta move, man.
[00:42.40]Take a look at that.
[00:43.70]That's how we do it.
[00:45.60]22 seconds almost, flat.
[00:47.76]Best time in the world, 22 seconds, look!
[00:51.44]So I'm gonna push this rock...
[00:55.33]Over to the right side of the rocks.
[00:57.19]Rock's gonna get hit by the dart coming out of the statue's mouth.
[01:00.29]Statue's gonna bounce over, off the McDonald's, off Grimace's head, nothing but net.
[01:05.13]You got it?
[01:05.67]Let's do it.
[01:06.07]You're supposed to wait, huh?
[01:11.07]Go on.
[01:12.25]Come on.
[01:13.19]Come on out.
[01:22.12]Oh, I have to get this.
[01:23.10]I gotta get this crystal skull.
[01:25.11]Come on, I'm Indiana Jones!
[01:26.64]The worst movie he made!
[01:27.52]FUCK!
[01:30.22]I've gotta get that skull.
[01:31.44]It is very important.
[01:32.40]I need to get, like, the super points.
[01:33.98]I have to.
[01:36.04]If I don't get the extra points, then what's the point?
[01:40.32]That was a pretty good pun, wasn't it?
[01:42.77]If I can't get- I gotta write that down, hold on.
[01:44.49]If I can't get the points, then what's the point?
[01:53.69]Gimme an Emmy.
[01:55.52]Give me a fucking Emmy.
[01:57.91]So this is where the actual game starts, huh?
[02:01.33]Things have fallen already.
[02:04.65]Unforgiving.
[02:06.59]We're not gonna get our hands hold anymore.
[02:09.59]There's no mice.
[02:10.45]None of our mice friends are here to tell us super secret strategies.
[02:14.40]So we're on our own.
[02:16.92]Um... No.
[02:21.06]No.
[02:21.48]I guess we gotta go this way then.
[02:24.59]I guess so.
[02:28.33]Oh, I can push this.
[02:31.46]Just need to use a little bit of science.
[02:34.36]Once you've deduced the problem with the scientific method, that's when you win the game.
[02:41.30]Good old science!
[02:44.56]She planted me with science!
[02:46.44]I'm not gonna last.
[02:50.76]If you guys think you're gonna get a series out of this, I ain't gonna last, dude.
[02:56.56]I'm gonna last, like, 20 minutes, and I'm gonna go get, like, a fucking sandwich.
[03:02.51]That sounds like a better idea.
[03:04.13]You know what?
[03:04.45]What kind of sandwich do I want, now that I'm thinking about it?
[03:06.59]Because that's, like, more important to me right now than this, like, game that's really hard.
[03:11.89]I think maybe I'd get a, uh, a large, like, steak and cheese with some onions?
[03:18.11]Mmm, that sounds pretty good.
[03:20.39]Maybe a buffalo chicken sub with extra blue cheese on it?
[03:25.03]That sounds pretty damn good.
[03:27.93]Stop talking about sandwiches and play the game.
[03:30.08]Like, focus.
[03:31.22]Focus on the game, not buffalo subs.
[03:35.08]Not messing around.
[03:36.18]I need to beat level one.
[03:37.36]Level one needs to be completed.
[03:39.10]Fucking god damn...
[03:42.66]We're gonna cut that out.
[03:43.86]We're gonna edit.
[03:44.42]See, we just edited.
[03:45.46]Hey, what's going on?
[03:46.54]Jerma here.
[03:47.08]We're just gonna play some 1001 Spikes.
[03:48.84]Level 1.
[03:49.60]It's fucking easy.
[03:50.54]This is my first try.
[03:52.23]You know what I mean?
[03:56.49]So, is it weird to lose, like, almost, like, 50 lives before the first level?
[04:02.29]Is that considered... Am I good?
[04:03.41]Am I good at this game?
[04:04.79]Okay, assess the situation here.
[04:08.92]When I jump up, I'm gonna get shot.
[04:10.56]So, I don't wanna go that way.
[04:11.46]I wanna go across.
[04:13.33]There's... I knew it.
[04:14.49]Yeah, you can't trick me.
[04:19.71]Spikes?
[04:21.57]You always have to look out for spikes.
[04:22.67]There's spikes everywhere in this game.
[04:24.43]I know the game's called A Thousand and One Spikes.
[04:27.55]But there's spikes just everywhere!
[04:29.75]There's spikes everywhere!
[04:30.95]There's scorpions!
[04:33.23]Isn't that like a Pokemon?
[04:34.17]That looks like a Pokemon.
[04:36.21]Is that like Scorpizoid?
[04:37.58]Isn't that a Pokemon?
[04:40.20]When is my Scorpizoid gonna evolve into, like, a fucking Scorpizio?
[04:45.84]Whoa!
[04:46.20]I don't know what to do!
[04:52.05]I don't know where to go!
[04:53.87]I'm freaking out!
[04:54.63]Alright, just stay right there.
[04:56.09]Okay, a bunch of Scorpizoids just dropped.
[04:58.93]Good to know.
[05:00.41]Drop down here... No, not yet, not yet.
[05:02.49]We're gonna wait.
[05:03.19]We have to wait until he goes the other way.
[05:06.00]Get out of the way.
[05:07.06]Here we go...
[05:10.75]Spike?
[05:11.23]Yep.
[05:12.25]I know your game now.
[05:14.49]I know your stupid game, Spike.
[05:17.15]Spike?
[05:17.77]Nope.
[05:19.33]Shit.
[05:21.35]What do I do here?
[05:23.93]What do I do here?
[05:24.99]I can't do anything here.
[05:27.36]I can't make that jump either, can I?
[05:28.76]Can I?
[05:29.08]I don't know.
[05:30.00]I don't know.
[05:31.58]I don't know.
[05:34.74]I don't think I can.
[05:35.30]I can.
[05:41.48]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[05:44.56]Button.
[05:45.08]Press.
[05:46.08]Jump.
[05:47.80]Long jump!
[05:49.03]Long jump!
[05:51.43]So what happens if I die 946 more times and the game's over?
[05:55.67]Is that how this works?
[05:57.15]That's definitely gonna happen.
[05:58.77]I'll burn through like 700 of these by World 3.
[06:02.28]Well... I should probably be careful then.
[06:11.35]Excuse me!
[06:11.77]I said excuse me!
[06:13.54]You're supposed to get out of the way!
[06:16.24]This is like World 1.
[06:21.82]Jump.
[06:22.66]Drop down here.
[06:23.20]Jump.
[06:23.58]Shoot.
[06:24.18]Jump.
[06:24.64]Shoot.
[06:25.18]Jump.
[06:25.69]Shoot.
[06:26.21]Got it.
[06:29.99]Scorpizio, get out of my face!
[06:33.37]Do I risk it?
[06:34.19]This is a bad idea.
[06:34.95]This is a really bad idea.
[06:36.39]I know it's a bad-
[06:40.51]That's exactly what I needed.
[06:41.55]Okay.
[06:43.63]We're gonna drop this one down too.
[06:45.63]Go.
[06:46.51]Go for it.
[06:48.66]Beautiful.
[06:49.92]Absolutely beautiful.
[06:51.52]Just don't screw it up now.
[06:53.88]Don't you dare... I don't even know... I think... I swear... I'm good.
[07:01.98]Yay.
[07:04.43]So what do I do here?
[07:05.75]Do I drop down here?
[07:06.61]I don't know.
[07:09.25]I'm confused.
[07:12.09]So I must have to break that?
[07:16.51]I don't know.
[07:18.57]Don't do that!
[07:19.15]You're gonna get burnt.
[07:21.95]Now do it.
[07:23.49]Okay.
[07:24.69]It's broken now.
[07:27.39]One more time.
[07:28.71]Go.
[07:29.57]Spikes?
[07:30.11]Yeah!
[07:30.99]See?
[07:31.67]You didn't think I knew that was gonna happen?
[07:35.04]You think what?
[07:35.40]You think I'm an idiot right now?
[07:40.01]Dude, I'm so scared right now.
[07:42.45]Where do I even go?
[07:44.46]When I get over here, there's gonna be, like, spikes and shit, and there's gonna be, like, a face shooting at me, darts.
[07:51.84]And you know it's gonna happen, and I'm probably not gonna survive this, because I have not been down here yet.
[07:56.87]Oh, God!
[08:00.21]Make it.
[08:01.67]Make it.
[08:02.96]No, I turned and I shot.
[08:04.35]I turned and I shot.
[08:06.23]I did.
[08:07.19]And you all saw it.
[08:07.91]I turned with total precision.
[08:10.23]Alright, that's it.
[08:12.35]That's it.
[08:12.89]No, we're done here.
[08:14.13]We're done with this.
[08:14.93]I'm just gonna, we're going for it.
[08:16.09]And I'm gonna get it right now.
[08:17.11]No stopping.
[08:18.07]No bullshit.
[08:19.69]This is the Super Meat Boy strategy.
[08:21.27]I've said this before.
[08:22.62]Just go.
[08:23.66]Just go.
[08:24.16]Don't even, don't stop for anything.
[08:25.66]Except for the things that you have to stop for.
[08:27.48]Go.
[08:27.76]Like for instance, just go.
[08:28.64]Right now.
[08:29.02]Turn.
[08:30.20]I'm shooting!
[08:32.69]Just go.
[08:34.43]After this, we're just gonna go.
[08:35.15]We're gonna go the whole way.
[08:36.63]Whole way.
[08:38.47]Yeah.
[08:39.17]Come on, shoot it again.
[08:41.43]Go.
[08:42.83]Shoot it again.
[08:43.21]I'm beating this right now.
[08:45.80]Wait for the stupid, like, piss fire to come out.
[08:50.36]No, no, just wait.
[08:51.38]Hold on.
[08:52.56]Not yet.
[08:54.12]Now do it.
[08:56.48]I'm just so concerned about the left over here.
[08:58.04]And even though it's coming out so slowly...
[09:02.61]God.
[09:03.45]Seriously.
[09:04.25]Go.
[09:05.83]Grab this.
[09:06.27]Watch the spike.
[09:07.83]Watch the spike.
[09:08.73]Nothing's right here, but I can go.
[09:10.01]Time to go!
[09:10.77]It's time just to go!
[09:11.84]Just go, mother- After this, you're going.
[09:14.76]You're gone.
[09:15.42]You're already gone.
[09:18.34]And... Holy shit!
[09:22.06]Oh my god!
[09:23.58]Yes!
[09:24.84]Oh.
[09:25.93]Ooh.
[09:28.23]Oof.
[09:30.46]Is that the end?
[09:31.37]Is that the end of stage two?
[09:32.29]I hope so.
