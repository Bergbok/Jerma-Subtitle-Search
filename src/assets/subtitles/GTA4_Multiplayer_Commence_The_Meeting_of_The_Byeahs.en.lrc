[03:26.69]Can you see this guy that is forever on fire?
[03:33.42]This guy.
[03:47.30]Man, that was crazy.
[03:48.51]I can't believe that just happened.
[03:50.53]I hope it doesn't happen again.
[03:52.07]Protect me, my BS.
[03:53.47]Protect me.
[03:53.85]Where are they going?
[03:54.47]They don't even know where they're going.
[03:55.53]Ha ha ha ha!
[04:12.61]They're awful!
[04:14.39]They're not even attacking anything, they're just running!
[04:18.85]You guys suck!
[04:21.77]Come on, do something!

[04:36.49]You can't fuck...
[04:38.74]This goes out to the broken-hearted.
[04:46.76]It's my life, and it's now or never.
[04:52.25]I don't wanna live forever.
[04:56.35]I just wanna... Well, I died with god mode on.
[05:07.11]I have no control over my character.
[05:11.05]I'm just on fire!
[05:15.41]How are you on fire?
[05:17.52]It's a dinosaur!
[05:19.56]It's a dinosaur!
