[00:08.73]I'm going to be your distraction heavy.
[00:11.51]You're going to be sniper.
[00:12.85]Your goal is to don't use the machine gun.
[00:14.79]You're going to use the sniper rifle gun.
[00:16.25]I want to use the machine gun.
[00:18.11]Oh, dude.
[00:18.77]Whoa, easy.
[00:19.79]Watch that hand.
[00:21.03]Watch that right hand.
[00:22.17]Watch that hit.
[00:25.48]We're playing an RTS right now.
[00:27.48]Like, I'm one of your units.
[00:28.90]Go towards the door.
[00:30.10]Stand next to the door.
[00:31.10]Okay, I'm one of your units.
[00:32.18]You're just like, yeah, Commander!
[00:33.78]Affirmative.
[00:34.76]I'm gonna die.
[00:35.46]Alright, I'm here.
[00:36.98]I'm here.
[00:37.30]I need to be commanded.
[00:39.83]I don't have any commands.
[00:41.97]What am I supposed to do?
[00:42.93]Affirmative.
[00:44.63]Affirmative.
[00:46.83]Distract him.
[00:47.33]What do you think I'm doing?
[00:48.73]He's running away.
[00:51.57]He's just trying to kill me.
[00:52.65]Come back, come back, come back.
[00:53.53]I'm trying.
[00:54.15]I think he knows you're there.
[00:58.21]I know he knows I'm here.
[01:00.13]Is he taunting you?
[01:01.31]No.
[01:02.49]I heard a Pyro taunting.
[01:10.95]We don't have players on this team that he can just walk around and do that.
[01:14.51]Yeah, come back with me.
[01:16.87]You need to like... Your default position as I command you is on me.
[01:21.34]So my default position is on you.
[01:23.30]That is my point.
[01:24.02]If I'm not saying anything, you need to, like, try and stand in me.
[01:27.11]So I'm, like, tethered to you, and then you need to select me?
[01:30.51]Yeah.
[01:30.95]Yeah, select you, and then I send you after someone.
[01:33.93]Okay.
[01:34.67]You've got it.
[01:35.95]Affirmative.
[01:38.41]Excuse me.
[01:39.03]Excuse me.
[01:41.41]Yeah.
[01:41.85]Stand in front of me.
[01:42.68]No, the spy.
[01:43.22]Punch the spy.
[01:44.04]Punch the demo.
[01:44.88]No, don't punch the demo.
[01:45.50]Back up, back up.
[01:46.54]What?
[01:46.68]You can't give me two different... I'm not... Come with me.
[01:50.48]You can't give me, like, that many commands.
[01:51.64]Give it to Locus Bar.
[01:52.84]Here.
[01:53.16]Mine.
[01:53.84]Take it.
[01:54.29]I can't.
[01:55.53]You can't drop it.
[01:56.73]I'm gonna get headshot.
[01:57.39]Why are you not using the sandwich?
[01:59.13]Because I wanted extra health.
[02:00.21]I wanted 350 health.
[02:02.39]Get a medic to heal you.
[02:03.45]You'd have full health right now if you had the normal thing.
[02:06.42]Well, we don't have a medic.
[02:08.20]Walk in front of this heavy.
[02:09.50]I... Okay.
[02:12.49]Do something.
[02:15.85]You didn't do it right.
[02:18.31]What?
[02:19.61]You didn't do it right?
[02:23.26]Walk in front of this heavy.
[02:24.50]Okay.
[02:25.56]You didn't do it right.
[02:26.94]Let me just take my feet and walk one after the other after the other in front of the heavy.
[02:31.62]How do you not do that right?
[02:35.51]There's a soldier back here.
[02:36.29]If you see him, run towards him.
[02:37.35]Otherwise, you're tethered.
[02:38.39]Okay, I see the soldier.
[02:39.35]Run towards soldier.
[02:40.07]Walk at him.
[02:41.45]Going for him.
[02:42.89]Commanded.
[02:44.29]Excellent job.
[02:44.79]Distracted.
[02:45.29]Distracted.
[02:45.57]Excellent distraction.
[02:46.63]Excellent work.
[02:48.63]Okay.
[02:50.36]Okay.
[02:50.76]Hold your position on me.
[02:52.36]Watch for spies.
[02:54.76]I just saw that spy, dude.
[02:56.92]Back up.
[02:57.24]Back up.
[02:57.98]Watch out.
[02:58.42]Watch out.
[02:58.84]Watch out.
[02:59.38]Why is he here?
[03:00.12]Let's be realistic about this.
[03:02.19]No.
[03:02.91]No.
[03:06.69]Walk at this pyro.
[03:08.67]I'm not with you right now.
[03:12.11]Don't worry, I'm here!
[03:13.37]I'm here!
[03:14.75]He just doesn't know I exist yet.
[03:18.21]Say nicely.
[03:21.99]Oh, you... What the fuck is this hat?! !
[03:25.73]I was getting tons of kills before we started this.
[03:28.03]I can't headshot anyone right now.
[03:29.71]I think it's all your fault How is it my fault?
[03:31.94]Nothing's changed.
[03:33.18]If anything it's gotten easier for you.
[03:34.94]No, this is way harder I don't think you understand how much harder this is.
[03:38.98]Where are you?
[03:39.48]Because I'm trying to keep track of like a child while I'm playing this game Fight this spy with me.
[03:44.78]You never like know where I am.
[03:47.18]Okay, where am I going?
[03:48.20]Captain?
[03:49.28]Commander?
[03:52.03]Alright, he's dead.
[03:52.57]Stay on me.
[03:53.55]I have on you.
[03:54.01]Keep your focus on me.
[03:55.33]What do you think I'm doing?
[03:55.93]If you see anything else that you think is happening that's important, it's not me.
[03:59.99]Alright, okay, alright.
[04:01.37]You're much faster than me.
[04:04.82]Okay.
[04:05.94]Where are the coordinates?
[04:06.82]Go stand right out on the tracks.
[04:08.52]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[04:10.08]Yeah, yeah, distraction heavy's giving you a hand here.
[04:11.82]Watch out for this guy.
[04:16.77]Walk towards this health kit.
[04:19.63]Okay.
[04:20.07]There's a teleporter up there.
[04:21.97]There's also a sentry and a dispenser.
[04:24.57]Let me get rid of the sentry.
[04:25.77]First, let me... Excuse me.
[04:27.63]Hello?
[04:27.77]Let's give him Uber.
[04:28.61]Give him Uber.
[04:29.37]Let me give him Uber.
[04:30.62]That's what you're doing.
[04:31.86]Eat it.
[04:32.16]Eat it.
[04:32.66]Fucking Christ.
[04:34.00]You're supposed to be shooting them.
[04:39.68]It's so hard to stop and aim and focus on what I'm supposed to do when you desperately want, like, me to give you commands.
[04:46.79]You would not fist fight that medic unless I gave you instruction to do it.
[04:54.23]I'm going to take the heat from the sentry.
[04:55.46]There's a sentry in here.
[04:57.44]Do something!
[04:58.82]Please!
[04:59.90]What the f- Did we do anything?
[05:03.45]There was pure carnage on that sentry.
[05:05.79]We didn't do it.
[05:07.11]Three- Me, you, and one pyro, I don't know why, ran at the sentry and tried to- What the fuck is going on here?
[05:14.03]He's doing a germaplan.
[05:15.64]How is that sentry still alive?
[05:16.88]Did you see how many people were just shooting at it?
[05:19.94]I don't know, sentries.
[05:21.16]There were like nine people shooting at the sentry and it was still alive.
[05:25.64]How did that- It was immortal.
[05:29.70]I just expect you to know some things.
[05:32.71]Coming back.
[05:34.11]Coming back.
[05:35.01]Right behind you.
[05:35.79]How old is this lemonade?
[05:36.75]I'm gonna have to find this out.
[05:40.21]I order you to not drink that lemonade.
[05:43.15]Oh, that was gross.
[05:44.29]Behind you, please.
[05:45.31]Oh, that was disgusting, dude.
[05:47.57]I ordered you.
[05:48.59]Come on.
[05:49.29]Wait, you told me not to?
[05:50.65]Yes.
[05:51.17]Oh, shit.
[05:51.95]I wouldn't have done it.
[05:52.51]Alright, where am I going?
[05:54.59]Up here, tether.
[05:57.00]We're gonna... Mission ends in 60 seconds.
[06:02.23]Okay, come with me.
[06:03.15]What's up?
[06:03.71]Going under.
[06:04.74]This is an ultimate strat.
[06:05.84]I really believe in this strat.
[06:07.28]You believe in this one?
[06:07.92]Okay.
[06:10.54]We're trying to get to their spawn.
[06:11.80]We're about to, like, lose the game.
[06:13.46]No, it doesn't matter.
[06:14.10]It doesn't matter?
[06:14.96]I think this is important.
[06:16.02]Ah, watch it, watch it.
[06:17.80]He's distracted.
[06:18.24]Get your sandwich.
[06:18.79]He's distracted.
[06:22.47]They're both... Dude, come on.
