[00:09.86]No, what?
[00:10.42]What am I doing?
[00:12.30]Fuck.
[00:18.21]Thank you.
[00:20.73]I want to go over to the forest area.
[00:23.13]I want to get out of this area.
[00:26.29]Oh, but this area is tough.
[00:29.17]Oh, boy.
[00:29.67]Oh, boy.
[00:32.23]Mage OP.
[00:33.77]Look at my health!
[00:35.65]Dude!
[00:37.51]No!
[00:38.83]I just wanted to get the money!
[00:40.25]I just wanted to grab the money, and I lost a character that was very, very good.
[00:50.04]Oh my god.
[00:51.82]Do I have a miner?
[00:52.58]No, I want my miners, I want my spelunkers, those are my favorite characters!
[00:59.30]This guy has ADHD.
[01:01.21]He moves faster.
[01:03.15]So let's see how that is.
[01:04.23]So this guy has ADHD.
[01:05.39]I don't even have enough money to upgrade anything.
[01:09.31]What the hell?
[01:10.91]And as you upgrade, as you'll see, you build the castle.
[01:14.21]So if I go over here...
[01:16.46]Once I put 1410 gold into this ability right here, this Shinobi, upgrade Shinobis, another tier of my castle is going to be built with more options for me.
[01:26.74]So, like, this will unlock two more options, that will unlock two more options, etc., etc.
[01:33.58]But I don't have enough money to do anything.
[01:34.86]Because I died.
[01:38.88]I want to max this out, this one down here.
[01:41.39]But look at how expensive that is.
[01:42.65]6,000 gold to be able to have more gold drop?
[01:47.42]That's a bunch of BS.
[01:48.58]So, I picked the Spell Sword.
[01:51.79]This is kind of a hybrid mage slasher film.
[01:56.19]What is... making weird noises here.
[01:59.35]Hooray!
[02:01.15]Let's go.
[02:01.51]Oh, okay.
[02:04.24]So, she shoots the bigger things.
[02:06.50]I completely forgot about that.
[02:08.88]What do you have for runes here?
[02:09.78]I should probably do some magic runes, maybe?
[02:12.76]If I have them in... No, I'm gonna do Double Jump.
[02:14.78]Forget about everything else.
[02:16.72]I'm equipping double jump.
[02:18.46]Because double jump is so important.
[02:20.53]I just never put it on.
[02:22.87]Take my money.
[02:23.55]Let's go.
[02:23.97]Building the random dungeon.
[02:26.81]Give me that money.
[02:33.23]I'm not even sure if there is, but I wish there was a way to be able to have different kind of character traits roll more often.
[02:41.84]I think that'd be pretty cool.
[02:43.34]So you could kind of build for more miners to be part of your lineage.
[02:46.78]Are you trying to tell me I only got one gold piece from that?
[02:54.08]Are you kidding me?
[02:55.68]Those rooms are usually full of money.
[03:00.30]Oh, oh my god.
[03:01.62]I'm gonna scream.
[03:02.74]I'm going to scream.
[03:04.62]I'm gonna I'm gonna scream I've swear to God if that happens again.
[03:08.74]I'm going to screech as loud as I can Just go up here.
[03:14.00]Oh My god, it's time for the rage Time for Jerma rage to start boiling Um Screw you and screw you Go back to hell
[03:30.88]Let's go up.
[03:32.48]Okay, I could probably do this one.
[03:33.52]No, I can't.
[03:34.46]No, I can't.
[03:35.38]Because I can't shoot up.
[03:37.76]I can only shoot through the walls this way.
[03:40.94]Well, that really sucks.
[03:43.34]Damn it.
[03:48.31]You had to come up from the ground, didn't you?
[03:51.29]That's so annoying.
[03:52.19]That's so annoying.
[03:58.44]Hmm, I'm actually not really doing that bad considering the amount of times I've been hit.
[04:04.32]People are dropping a lot of money.
[04:05.64]And I got full.
[04:10.24]You know, just take a huge saw blade.
[04:15.75]Nice.
[04:16.91]Oh my god, I thought I was gonna one-hit you.
[04:18.85]783.
[04:22.89]I want like 2,000.
[04:25.33]I gotta stay alive enough where I can get two grand.
[04:29.04]Because that is where it's at.
[04:33.24]Yeah!
[04:35.38]Brrroom, brrroom, brrroom!
[04:40.22]Um, gotta go right.
[04:42.76]Haven't been down there yet.
[04:44.41]Let's go!
[04:46.29]Alright, so this is the old boss room.
[04:48.87]I've already beaten this boss, so the door is closed.
[04:50.95]But there's two chests in here every single time, guaranteed.
[04:55.75]Look at how much money we just made from that, holy jeez.
[05:00.25]Holy jeez.
[05:01.37]Let me take a sip of my coffee.
[05:07.36]Ah, coffee.
[05:11.72]Every time I swing at somebody, I get mana back, which is amazing.
[05:15.71]I didn't know that was on this guy's traits, as a Spellsword.
[05:21.17]That's unbelievable.
[05:22.43]Alright, this might be like the...
[05:26.45]What?! !
[05:29.05]How am I supposed to get over this?
[05:30.19]Can I... Can I jump on those vases?
[05:34.99]Wow.
[05:35.93]Okay, this is difficult.
[05:39.73]Holy... Double jump to the rescue.
[05:43.62]Well, that's a bad room.
[05:44.96]Okay, this is where I wanted to make it.
[05:46.82]I wanted to make it over here so we could go through some of this.
[05:49.28]Make a little bit more money.
[05:51.44]You guys get the idea.
[05:56.63]Twelve gold...
[05:59.15]I love gold.
[06:01.40]The look of it.
[06:02.84]The texture of it.
[06:04.82]I love gold so much, I even had my whole boy.
[06:10.92]Goldfinger.
[06:15.39]This is gonna take me to the other area, yes it is.
[06:19.69]Don't really care that much as long as I can get back over to the forest.
[06:23.29]Forest of Abkhazia.
[06:34.12]Mmm, look at this dog.
[06:36.32]Hello, doggie.
[06:36.94]Another chest.
[06:41.78]This is looking like a good run so far.
[06:44.93]The first pretty much good run is happening like 20 minutes into this.
[06:52.25]Please kill him.
[06:54.31]Please.
[06:56.26]Get out of my way.
[06:59.22]Get out of the way!
[07:02.86]If I get 5,000 gold this run, you better believe, you bet your ass it's going into that money thing.
[07:08.31]Hey!
[07:10.09]Didn't your mother ever teach you not to throw stones?!
[07:14.37]Throw stones!
[07:19.41]Watch out for this skull.
[07:22.67]No shit!
[07:26.05]Don't let me die.
[07:29.69]Those are spikes.
[07:31.13]Those are... And there goes the run, because I just took, like, way too much damage right there.
[07:42.95]That was so dumb.
[07:45.24]Ooh.
[07:46.16]Maybe not... Why can they shoot through walls?
[07:48.96]Look it, that's going through the ground.
[07:52.40]God, that's so annoying.
[07:55.34]Euro... Euro... Yeah, how many euros did I pick up this run?
[08:02.37]Dropping through the ground is very simple, you just sit down and then A. I would also recommend you have a... a controller for this game.
[08:11.24]Cause doing this with mouse and keyboard, or just keyboard, is probably just like a Super Meat Boy, where it's insanely difficult to use, and then the other one's just way better than the other.
[08:23.31]General Entry.
[08:23.87]I'm gonna have to go through and read these one of these days, go just read through them all.
[08:27.91]Cause they're pretty funny.
[08:30.19]I will make my father proud.
[08:32.20]Don't think you will.
[08:32.88]I don't think you will, because I'm going to make Father proud.
[08:40.00]By collecting all the jewels.
[08:44.09]4,155.
[08:44.15]We're doing well so far.
[08:46.85]Got to get over that 5,000 mark.
[08:51.19]If I want to upgrade that thing that I want to upgrade, I'm going to have to get over the 5,000 mark.
[08:57.22]Thanks for the rocket jump.
[09:00.28]I'm freaking out.
[09:01.44]I'm freaking out.
[09:02.04]Slow it down.
[09:02.60]Slow it down.
[09:03.00]Be careful.
[09:04.92]I ran out of... There we go.
[09:07.95]Okay.
[09:10.49]Okay.
[09:15.47]Freaking out here.
[09:16.71]I'm like freaking out so bad.
[09:18.93]I don't want to lose this run.
[09:21.57]I do not want to lose this run.
[09:25.55]That would make me very sad because I'm so close.
[09:28.91]to getting that mark.
[09:33.65]What was it?
[09:34.91]6,000?
[09:35.15]5,900 or something?
[09:36.35]Something like that.
[09:41.81]No!
[09:44.93]Take the big one, man.
[09:54.77]Okay, I gotta go up.
[10:07.45]Both of y'all get out of here.
[10:11.82]I can't get that chest because I'm too big.
[10:15.16]You can be a dwarf in this game.
[10:16.52]That can be one of the traits.
[10:17.40]And you can sneak up there.
[10:20.48]Let's go the other way.
[10:21.24]I don't trust the left way at all.
[10:23.42]Absolutely not.
[10:24.24]Okay, let's go right.
[10:31.30]Or just walk into that rolling wheel of death.
[10:33.90]It's a great idea, too.
[10:37.04]Damn.
[10:39.13]Big saw!
[10:40.97]No money from those guys.
[10:43.37]Are you kidding me right now?
[10:48.91]Watch out for the bones!
[10:49.79]Watch out!
[10:50.93]No!
[10:52.07]No, you... Son of a... Aye, aye, yai.
[11:01.32]No!
[11:02.52]No!
[11:10.82]I don't want to run into his arrow.
[11:12.86]I'm gonna do it.
[11:16.96]That chest might put me over the edge.
[11:25.07]Go through this room to the left and then to the top right.
[11:30.47]So you guys see what I'm talking about?
[11:31.93]How life leech is so important?
[11:35.23]I would have been dead like three times in this run.
[11:37.29]Is there anything in here?
[11:41.47]No.
[11:43.29]I'm always so bad with these type of traps, man.
[11:48.73]My brain, I can't even think.
[11:50.74]I need to go then.
[11:51.54]Now.
[11:51.62]Okay.
[12:03.12]Don't die from these spikes, please.
[12:07.44]Ooh, I found a blueprint.
[12:09.76]Blueprints are ways for you to make gear.
[12:12.56]You find them scattered around the world.
[12:16.74]And you can buy them and equip them.
[12:18.60]That's how I got those items that you saw previously.
[12:21.92]Where am I even going?
[12:22.84]I gotta go up.
[12:28.72]Damn, man.
[12:29.58]Damn it.
[12:31.06]I might die right here.
[12:39.19]That was pretty nerve-wracking, not gonna lie.
[12:45.93]If I take one hit, I'm dead.
[12:48.17]One single hit, I'm going to die.
[12:53.54]Let's hope that doesn't happen.
[12:56.78]Like right...
[13:02.94]Did you see that?
[13:03.67]How did that not kill me?
[13:07.61]I can't believe.
[13:08.45]I didn't think that could go through the ground.
[13:12.09]Get out of the way.
[13:16.76]I am shocked right now that I'm still alive.
[13:19.98]Absolutely shocked.
[13:22.12]That's a huge guy.
[13:23.76]End of the road.
[13:24.38]End of the road, guys.
[13:25.54]Thank you so much for watching.
[13:26.42]I really do appreciate it.
[13:27.78]And that's where we die because there's too many boss things in here.
[13:32.40]Damn it!
[13:36.64]Well... I still don't have a miner.
[13:42.47]Well, let's do the upgrades for it.
[13:43.61]Uh, where's my... Spellsword's actually pretty damn good, though.
[13:46.95]Spellsword is really good.
[13:50.64]Hmm, I got a lot of money.
[13:53.78]Upgrade my HP.
[13:54.90]I'm gonna do this a couple times.
[13:58.47]And let's go with damage again, because I want to... I have these good attack up, though.
[14:04.45]Hmm.
[14:07.67]We could always do mana cost down.
[14:10.36]I don't have any money for that now, though.
[14:13.96]Let's do more damage from spells.
[14:16.80]Makes the most sense.
[14:19.78]And now I'm going to leave here with this money.
[14:23.63]Oh, I could have a higher mana pool.
[14:28.48]Yeah, let's just go ahead and do that.
[14:30.52]Uh, the gear I have on is fine.
[14:35.41]Spell!
[14:35.93]Sword!
[14:36.37]Spell!
[14:36.93]Sword!
[14:37.39]Spell!
[14:37.95]Sword!
