[00:00.86]Hey, what's up?
[00:03.10]Hey.
[00:04.18]Hey.
[00:06.02]What's going on, guys?
[00:06.58]How you doing?
[00:08.62]Hey, hey, hey.
[00:09.56]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[00:10.42]Can you hear me?
[00:11.32]Is this thing on?
[00:12.08]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[00:15.66]Real voice?
[00:16.56]Wait, what happened?
[00:17.08]I don't know why the GoXLR does this.
[00:21.42]Did I fix it?
[00:22.00]Hold on.
[00:23.76]Can you hear me?
[00:25.66]I sound fucked up?
[00:26.38]I do?
[00:28.62]That's good.
[00:28.98]Alright.
[00:30.47]Let me... Hold on a sec.
[00:44.56]Why are you linking a clip of you thinking that I farted on stream once?
[00:49.54]Like two years ago.
[00:50.60]Or like a year ago or something.
[00:54.43]Why even link that?
[00:56.95]I have never farted on stream.
[01:00.67]See, a lot of you guys probably don't understand this, but streamers have direct access to be able to control when you can and cannot hear them.
[01:10.68]Most streamers have a button that they can just press, and it just mutes the microphone.
[01:18.28]Now, I've never farted on stream, but I've farted during a stream hundreds of times.
[01:25.85]I just mute the microphone and just let it go.
[01:28.31]You don't even know what happened.
[01:29.31]You have no idea.
[01:33.01]I'm just like, okay, here comes one.
[01:34.39]Mute.
[01:35.55]I can sit there for 10 seconds and just fart.
[01:38.49]Burp and shit.
[01:40.43]And then come back and you did not even know that I left.
[01:44.01]Guys, I've taken entire phone calls while muted during cutscene before.
[01:50.77]Like, oh shit, I gotta make a quick phone call.
[01:53.03]Mute.
[01:53.35]Oh, we're in a cutscene.
[01:54.01]Who cares?
[01:58.03]And then right when the cutscene is over, I gotta go.
[01:59.69]I gotta go.
[01:59.99]Gotta go.
[02:00.41]Bye.
[02:01.13]Whoa.
[02:01.61]Whoa.
[02:02.05]Unmute.
[02:02.39]Whoa.
[02:02.91]Cool cutscene, guys.
[02:09.19]I'm sorry.
[02:13.45]He hates us.
[02:14.29]No.
[02:17.86]Sorry I wasn't live yesterday.
[02:20.99]I'm on a new medicine.
[02:22.91]And the medicine is a very common medicine, but I got some annoying side effects.
[02:28.13]It's a stomach medicine.
[02:29.99]And it made me kind of feel like shit.
[02:32.33]I started taking it like two days ago.
[02:33.41]So we're going to take it easy today.
[02:37.13]I'll acclimate to the new medicine.
[02:41.66]This stream is going to be probably pretty short.
[02:44.70]Maybe a few hours, maybe.
[02:45.62]Just going to chill.
[02:48.15]And in the recommended channel, there was a game that was highly recommended.
[02:54.47]It's a game where you make your own chocolates and you have your own chocolate company.
[02:59.81]So that's exactly what we're going to do.
[03:02.31]Tomorrow we're going to play Connect.
[03:03.31]And we're going to play Connect the day after that too.
[03:08.28]I mean, how am I going to... Am I not going to play Connectables?
[03:12.82]I've had that sitting there for like a year.
[03:15.20]More than that.
[03:16.96]I have so much Connect that I... There's probably like 10 plus Connect games to play.
[03:21.27]When are you going to play Boom Blocks?
[03:29.09]I don't know.
[03:30.21]Will we go back to the Wii eventually?
[03:33.03]What about GTA RP?
[03:35.07]Yeah, I...
[03:36.90]I just haven't had time to do it.
[03:38.84]I haven't had time to, like, get into it and, like, apply and sign up.
[03:42.95]The archaeology stream has taken up most of the time.
[03:45.57]And another one.
[03:46.37]Two other streams, actually.
[03:49.78]We're going to go bang, bang, bang, bang with streams here over the next few months.
[03:59.83]The archaeology stream is going to be a lot of fun.
[04:01.45]I can't wait.
[04:02.51]I can't wait.
[04:03.15]I don't want to talk about it that much because it's like... You'll see.
[04:07.76]Just March 6th, you'll see.
[04:09.18]It's going to be fun.
[04:14.70]And no, there's no Catboy stream.
[04:16.32]That's not... Catboy is not one of them.
[04:25.62]Catboy is not one of them.
[04:27.88]Why?
[04:28.38]Well, because I want to get that ready.
[04:31.56]I'm not just putting the ears on.
[04:32.86]I'm not putting the ears on and going like... That's not going to happen.
[04:37.70]I mean, I probably will do that.
[04:40.40]As a joke.
[04:41.54]That's what I just did.
[04:44.33]No.
[04:50.65]There's a lot going to... Just wait.
[04:53.19]Just wait and see.
[04:58.56]That stream is going to be a lot different than maybe you think it is.
[05:02.42]You're going to be a cat boy.
[05:03.50]Try hard.
[05:04.22]Yeah.
[05:07.92]Yes.
[05:12.87]What are you going to do?
[05:13.83]You're just going to have to watch.
[05:17.07]I don't want to tell you what happens on the TV show before the TV show comes out.
[05:27.43]I'm not, by the way, I'm not going to be on a TV show.
[05:29.03]Alright.
[05:30.57]This is, this is, uh, this game is going to be probably awesome or horrible.
[05:37.15]Depends on which one I am hoping that this is it from the looks of it.
[05:43.36]We get to design our own chocolates and own lattes.
[05:48.70]I can't wait.
[05:49.42]It's going to be fucking awesome.
[05:57.64]That word should be banned in this chat.
[06:02.08]No.
[06:03.52]Alright, here we go.
[06:04.20]This is called Chocolatier Decadence by Design.
[06:06.70]And apparently there are like four of these.
[06:09.13]Is my webcam on pointing at me?
[06:11.95]I hope not.
[06:15.13]Let's cover it to make sure.
[06:16.07]We good?
[06:18.92]We good?
[06:28.62]And here at the Olive Garden, you can get two entrees for only $2.99.
[06:34.40]It's another Olive Garden game.
[06:39.73]Our soup, salad, and breadsticks are talking the town.
[06:44.61]Chocolatier, decadence by design.
[06:46.37]Alright, hell, I thought that was dog food.
[06:53.27]I was like, how is this chocolate?
[06:54.21]This is a can of dog food.
[06:55.09]Alright.
[06:56.91]Welcome, chocolatier.
[06:58.96]Welcome to the world of Chocolatier.
[07:01.14]Generations ago, confectioner Martin Baumeister founded the chocolate company that bears his name.
[07:07.20]And for over a hundred years, the company has survived family squabbles, hostile competitors, and economic ups and downs.
[07:14.43]Just like the Olive Garden.
[07:16.31]Today, in the twin shadows of the Great Depression and World War II, the company's factories have been converted for the war effort or lie unused.
[07:24.51]And the disappearance of her husband, Sean, has left Alex Tanguy Fletcher unavailable to steer the company.
[07:30.25]Can you help them?
[07:35.80]What?
[07:36.08]It was an intro?
[07:39.74]Okay.
[07:45.62]Oh, yeah.
[07:45.96]Flash Player is uninstalled.
[07:47.86]It doesn't exist anymore.
[07:50.69]Right.
[07:51.45]Okay.
[07:52.29]Just imagine you watched it.
[07:57.39]Oh shit, can I play this game?
[07:59.05]Can I play this game?
[07:59.91]I don't think I can play this game.
[08:01.87]Is this game not going to work?
[08:06.78]Oh shit, hold on.
[08:08.92]Please enter your name.
[08:11.68]What should my name be?
[08:12.74]Oh no, I hope it's not Flash.
[08:14.33]I probably can't even play this.
[08:17.03]I probably can't even play this game.
[08:18.95]Well, okay.
[08:20.37]Let's find out.
[08:20.89]Don't be so upset about it yet.
[08:24.35]Alright, my name.
[08:26.11]What's a chocolatier name?
[08:27.23]I don't know.
[08:31.37]Angus?
[08:32.15]Angus to me does not scream chocolatier.
[08:36.66]Angus to me screams hamburger.
[08:41.92]Jerma the chocolate boy.
[08:43.10]That's my name?
[08:49.99]That's my full name.
[08:52.25]The last... No.
[08:55.37]Angus, no.
[08:57.77]Get off of that meme, for God's sakes.
[08:59.79]You're driving us mad.
[09:01.93]Alright, Wonka.
[09:09.16]Angus Khan.
[09:11.18]Zilly Zonka.
[09:12.38]Silly Wonka.
[09:15.54]Silly, silly Willy Wonka.
[09:17.92]No, that's just Willy Wonka with a silly, silly Willy.
[09:24.32]I kind of like Silly Willy.
[09:31.30]Silly Willy Wonderful.
[09:34.27]That sounds like an old WWF character.
[09:42.09]I feel like that's the guy that came out with Doink the Clown sometimes.
[09:45.03]Silly Willy Wonderful.
[09:52.02]Berserker.
[09:57.78]Silly Willy Zonka.
[09:58.96]I hate that.
[10:01.20]No, I'm not doing Silly Zonka.
[10:02.48]You can just add a Z and make it funny.
[10:06.47]Keep it.
[10:07.09]Silly Willy Zonka.
[10:08.45]I hate that.
[10:12.51]Yes, you can.
[10:14.79]It does make it funny.
[10:16.21]Watch me.
[10:16.85]Silly Willy Zonka?
[10:17.81]How about Silly Zonka?
[10:21.96]Yeah, Silly Zonka is better than Willy Wonka.
[10:24.16]Okay, Silly Zonka.
[10:27.15]silly zonka silly silly zonka wonka oh perfect that's like a good like copyright free version silly zonka wonka I don't care oh my god I thought it just didn't work
[10:52.93]That car was just driving off the road.
[10:55.13]Did anybody see that?
[10:56.49]That car was just skidding out of control.
[10:58.43]That was like a Homer Simpson car.
[11:00.55]Alright, we're supposed to chill.
[11:02.33]Look, look!
[11:03.81]Calm down.
[11:04.19]I'm supposed to relax.
[11:06.43]For most people, World War II is... Why is this World War II?
[11:09.89]For most people, World War II is finally over.
[11:11.87]Not for me.
[11:13.31]Until my husband Sean is accounted for.
[11:14.95]The war rages on.
[11:17.72]Wait, what?
[11:18.84]I won't mince words, silly zonka wonka.
[11:21.58]Bowmaster Confections is in shambles.
[11:24.69]And I simply can't focus on chocolate right now.
[11:27.49]I need someone else to manage the company.
[11:29.03]Okay, okay.
[11:38.42]You need to show me you can make chocolates and money.
[11:41.75]Once you have made at least $10,000, I'll make you CEO candidate and start introducing you to the board of directors.
[11:49.25]That's not very much to be CEO.
[11:53.21]To make $10,000 for a conglomerate company, that's not to be the CEO?
[12:01.11]Oh, it's World War II.
[12:02.09]How much is $10,000 in World War II bucks?
[12:04.97]Like in World War II dollars.
[12:06.95]Like with inflation and the change of the U.S.
[12:09.15]dollar and everything.
[12:10.19]And the yields, whatever that means.
[12:12.33]How much is $10,000 now?
[12:19.16]It's not billions of dollars.
[12:22.80]It's probably like 300 grand, maybe?
[12:24.06]200 grand?
[12:24.34]$145,000.
[12:24.36]Okay, that's a lot of money.
[12:24.98]That's a lot of money.
[12:25.48]Alright.
[12:31.70]So let's get started.
[12:33.42]Here are a hundred sacks each of sugar and cocoa.
[12:36.99]Go see Endred over at Zurich Chocolate Works to turn these ingredients into chocolates.
[12:42.19]Are you just going to hand them to me?
[12:45.26]Hey, Zilly, Zilly Wonka.
[12:47.44]I've got a hundred bags of sugar in the back of the truck.
[12:50.76]Here you are.
[12:51.34]Here they are.
[12:51.76]Just dumped them on the ground.
[12:56.55]Introduce yourself to Enrit Rast over at Zurich Chocolate Works.

[13:09.61]Why are there cars parked over here?
[13:11.05]Alright, where do I go?

[13:29.57]Oh, chocolate works.
[13:31.97]I feel for what Alex is going through.
[13:34.26]Zilly... Why couldn't I just make my name like Adam?
[13:39.14]I feel for what Alex is going through, silly zonka wonka.
[13:41.60]But boy, am I excited to get these machines working again.
[13:44.86]Click make chocolates and make at least five cases of basic chocolate bars.
[13:51.12]Basic chocolate bars.
[13:52.94]Make at least five cases.
[13:56.41]Paces per week.
[13:58.79]You have 60 seconds to set our production rate.
[14:01.07]What?
[14:02.23]Aim and click to fire ingredients.
[14:04.23]Match the fold tray you see on the right.
[14:08.07]I'll speed the machine up as you succeed and slow them down if you miss.
[14:11.37]Good luck.
[14:11.72]Why is this a fucking double dare exercise?
[14:16.82]What do I have to do?
[14:19.82]What am I doing?

[14:27.87]shoots out the window and like hits a fucking building next door you hear like cat scream uh-oh wasted ingredient use the full tray on the right as your guide I'll keep track of each ingredient you waste up on the right waste eight and I'll be forced to halt production okay there we go fuck I got that wrong what

[14:59.36]Okay.
[15:02.38]I don't understand how this works.
[15:04.82]These are all wrong.
[15:07.26]Okay, I have another almond.
[15:09.85]So the almond has to go up here.
[15:11.87]What the fuck is happening?
[15:14.61]Okay.
[15:16.23]That one broke.
[15:19.69]Do I have to aim it into the slot?
[15:21.03]What?
[15:22.28]I have to just match this, but the hit detection is fucking bizarre.
[15:26.86]What?
[15:27.08]I don't have any room for this.
[15:31.94]I got it.
[15:38.76]Oh, my God.
[15:39.66]Okay, I got six cases.
[15:43.40]Oh, fuck.

[15:52.15]That's fucking stupid.
[15:56.63]I didn't know what the hell I was looking at.
[15:57.79]Try again.
[16:00.59]Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[16:02.70]The things are in the middle.
[16:03.40]Here we go.
[16:03.70]Alright.
[16:04.84]Snowball.
[16:05.48]Almond.
[16:08.96]Wait, it doesn't matter.
[16:12.31]It doesn't matter.
[16:12.79]It doesn't matter.
[16:13.21]It literally doesn't matter.
[16:14.79]You just have to aim it at it.
[16:16.49]It doesn't matter.
[16:16.91]It literally does not matter at all.
[16:24.44]Come on, get it.
[16:33.99]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[16:39.39]Fuck.

[17:07.97]What the fuck is happening?
[17:10.09]I don't have any more ingedients?
[17:11.05]Slow down the production.

[17:51.07]Inventory levels for each ingredient we're using are shown with color-coded bars.
[17:55.20]Green means we've got plenty.
[17:57.44]Yellow means we're running low.
[17:58.78]And red means production will soon be stalled.
[18:01.61]So we always have to keep the snowballs and the almonds up.
[18:05.91]Speaking of ingredients, in order to keep making basic chocolate bars, we'll need more sugar and cocoa soon.

[20:53.49]And buy enough to make sure that you've got at least 200 sacks on hand.
[20:58.65]Look underneath.
[20:59.05]This is just rugs in a bag.
[21:02.63]You have not yet?
[21:03.15]Okay, I need this.
[21:03.73]So how many do I need?
[21:05.43]I'm selling sacks of sugar for $7 each.

[21:15.97]So I need... How many sacks do I want?
[21:23.71]200.
[21:23.73]At least 200 sacks on hand.
[21:25.89]All I can do is buy 200.
[21:26.43]No.
[21:26.57]How do I delete?
[21:37.30]115.
[21:37.32]Where's my stacks?

[21:51.43]Look down.
[21:58.66]Literally says 200.
[21:59.60]Yeah, I know, but I already had like 85.
[22:07.10]I already had like 85 sacks.
[22:09.13]I didn't use them all.
[22:14.65]What the fuck?
[22:17.45]You guys just got in my head.
[22:20.21]Kakao is only available near the equator.
[22:21.93]Click map, travel to Dulala, Cameroon and see my friend Tomj Dongo there.
[22:28.13]She'll be able to fix you up with the Kakao you need.
[22:30.15]Where's my inventory?
[22:34.72]I fucking told you I had already had like a hundred.
[22:37.76]Why is everybody yelling at me?
[22:39.42]Well, that's fine.
[22:41.41]Alright, map.

[23:01.24]Oh shit.
[23:04.42]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[23:06.76]Now I have to go to the market.
[23:07.92]I feel like they're going to soar over this mountain.
[23:13.14]It's like a jump.
[23:15.68]You've come to the right place for cacao.
[23:17.22]Silly zilly wonka.
[23:18.60]Buy enough so that you can get at least 200 sacks.
[23:24.27]I'm selling sacks of cacao for $11 each.
[23:29.75]How many do I have?
[23:32.13]I got 200.
[23:33.17]I should probably buy enough.
[23:34.33]I'm going to buy another 100.
[23:37.88]Okay.
[23:38.70]Terrific.
[23:39.02]Now get back to Zurich and see Alex.
[23:40.92]That poor woman, she truly believes she'll be able to find her husband.
[23:43.54]You have to admire her spirit, though.
[23:44.80]Okay.
[23:47.46]Okay.
[23:47.72]Look at all this inventory I got.
[23:50.90]Okay.
[23:51.08]Travel back.

[23:55.78]Okay.
[24:02.19]Let's go.
[24:03.59]I think you're starting to get the hang of things, silly zilly wonka, which is good because I need to leave soon.
[24:07.75]Next, make your way back over to Main Street Market.
[24:09.95]Brenna has a new ingredient you can use to make a new recipe, something that's always good for business.
[24:17.21]Word travels fast.
[24:18.11]I assume you're here to purchase some of my milk, which just arrived.
[24:20.96]As soon as you have milk, sugar, and cacao in your inventory, visit the factory here in Zurich to make a new recipe, milk chocolate bars.
[24:32.38]How much milk should I have?
[24:35.36]Should I buy like 100 milks?
[24:37.20]Alright, I'm going to buy one.
[24:38.16]Well, I don't have that much money.
[24:38.96]How many milks should I have?
[24:45.66]Like 25?
[24:46.10]25 milks.
[24:50.65]Alright, let's go to the factory.

[25:03.85]But I can make my own chocolate.
[25:28.09]Alright, here we go.
[25:28.91]Milk chocolate bars.
[25:32.47]Silky milk chocolate.
[25:33.51]Slightly sweeter than our dark chocolate offerings.

[32:29.44]Well, I wanted to check.
[32:31.50]Silly Zonkawonka, you've done it.
[32:33.34]You've shown your prowess at making chocolates and making money.
[32:36.89]Now I simply must go.
[32:38.41]Ready or not, the company's in your hands.
[32:40.27]As I promised, you are now the official CEO candidate of Baumeister Confections.
[32:45.95]There are five other members of the Ballmaster Convention's board of directors.
[32:49.65]You're going to need to work with them, each of them, one by one, to convince them that you are capable of being our CEO.
[32:55.11]Some you find easier to work with than others, but they are all good people.
[32:59.28]Why are you speaking, like, in, like, second person for me?
[33:03.50]This is weird.
[33:05.70]I am off to launch my search for Sean.
[33:08.74]I'll be in... Like, why is... I'm, like, reading a novel through my head.
[33:14.17]I'll be in touch as I can, and you should also keep an eye out on your travels for my assistant, Rick LaFontaine.
[33:23.26]If necessary, the rest of the board and I will be able to get messages to you through Rick.
[33:31.66]Right now, you need to go see my uncle Felix Baumeister in Cape Town.
[33:35.70]I think he's the best board member to begin with.
[33:38.56]Also, I understand that he's been working on some secret projects that may have a significant impact on our business.
[33:43.81]I know you can do it.
[33:44.75]Silly zonka wonka.
[33:45.91]Good luck.
[33:48.03]Alright.
[33:49.07]We're making... Wait.
[33:50.43]We're spending $2,500 a week?
[33:53.62]Is that how much I'm making?
[33:56.86]I'm confused.
[33:57.54]Alright.
[33:58.00]Quest log.
[33:59.54]You're ready.
[34:00.02]Talk to Felix.
[34:07.05]Here we go.
[34:07.83]$447.
[34:07.91]I can't wait.
[34:12.77]I'm going to sell the hell out of this.
[34:15.17]Alright.
[34:15.41]Talk to Felix.
[34:19.19]Where are we?
[34:24.31]If you're trying to find Felix, head over to Cape Town Manufacturing.
[34:26.73]Do I sell?
[34:28.65]I'm going to sell all.
[34:30.07]I bought $21,000.
[34:38.98]Welcome to South Africa, silly Wonka Zonka.
[34:42.23]I'm hopeful that you will indeed be able to steer our company through these rough modern waters.
[34:48.67]While the war was raging, I've been experimenting here with this old chocolate factory.
[34:52.72]You see, I love chocolate as much as the next guy, but my latest passion is coffee.
[34:56.68]It's my personal belief that coffee and coffee products represent a new frontier for our company.
[35:02.08]I just need a bit more time to iron out the kinks of these coffee machines.
[35:05.54]You need to keep expanding your repertoire of chocolate offerings and building up your business when making coffee.
[35:11.54]In the meantime, would you do something for me?
[35:13.76]Grab some peanuts from the market here in Cape Town, make 20 cases of chocolate bars with peanuts, and deliver them to Florian Amiel at University of Zurich.
[35:22.68]20... Okay.
[35:23.84]I need peanuts.
[35:25.90]I will.
[35:32.56]Look at our peanuts.
[35:33.62]Almonds?
[35:35.20]Holy shit, peanuts are so expensive.
[35:37.90]What does it take to... I don't have the... Wait, haggle?
[35:46.21]Wait, how do I get out?
[35:48.01]I can't leave?
[35:48.71]Okay, wait, there we go.
[35:52.11]Where are my recipes?
[35:55.67]Chocolate bars with peanuts.
[36:02.81]Okay, so sugar.
[36:03.83]There's no milk.
[36:04.45]That's good.
[36:07.13]So I just need... I need like... 100 sacks.
[36:12.06]Alright, I need 100.
[36:12.84]No, I don't.
[36:13.18]I need like... How many does he want?
[36:16.12]10 cases?
[36:16.46]20 cases.
[36:16.78]I need 20.
[36:18.26]I need 20 cases.
[36:18.70]20 sacks.
[36:18.84]Let's haggle.
[36:21.92]Haggle.
[36:29.91]Uh, did you have something to chat about?
[36:31.43]Are you joking?
[36:31.99]These prices are insane.
[36:34.08]I'm not asking for lots, but I want you to do something about your prices.
[36:38.36]Is it me or are your prices way out of line compared to other places?
[36:41.74]I'm going to buy from you.
[36:42.56]I'm just hoping you might be able to help a tad with your prices.
[36:44.84]Imagine walking into a place.
[36:51.38]Is it me or are you?
[36:52.64]What do you mean?
[36:53.20]Is it you?
[36:53.66]Are you talking to a bunch of people in the market?
[36:58.28]Trying to get everybody on board?
[37:01.63]Is it just me, or are these prices out of line compared to other places?
[37:05.13]Waiting for someone to be like, yeah, it is a little expensive.
[37:07.27]Yeah, it is a little expensive, isn't it?
[37:13.52]Got it.
[37:15.10]Since I'm in such a good mood today, I'll cut you a deal.
[37:17.18]That's a pretty good deal.
[37:19.80]Last seen in Cape Town for 86 per sec.
[37:22.54]We need... I should buy a shitload of them then, if I got a deal.
[37:26.82]Should I just buy $15,000 worth of peanuts?
[37:29.76]They don't go bad, do they?
[37:38.96]Wait, can I just take these and sell them?
[37:40.98]Ow, that hurt.
[37:41.98]Can I just take these and sell them in a different, like, country?
[37:47.74]Could I immediately get $85?
[37:51.20]Haggle more.
[37:52.04]Okay, you're nuts if you think I'll buy anything at these prices and I, like, look around and I, like, wink at everybody because I'm buying peanuts.
[38:12.46]he didn't like that okay alright alright alright fine fine fine okay let's do 50. now I could I could afford 100. let's just I'll do 100. that's a lot of money it's a big investment okay bring 20 cases of chocolate bars with peanuts so we have the ingredients what anything else I can do here
[38:43.12]Now that you're CEO candidate, you'll be able to haggle at shops and markets.
[38:46.90]Be careful, though.
[38:48.04]If you say the right thing, haggling can result in better prices, but you can also insult merchants and cause their prices to move the wrong way, too.
[38:54.89]Alright.
[39:00.19]Alright, we don't want to spend too much money.
[39:04.13]Let's go back.
[39:05.03]Let's make the chocolate with peanuts and make a hundred million dollars.
[39:12.90]I can sell these two.
[39:17.26]Penis is expensive?
[39:18.32]What are you talking about?
[39:18.96]Alright, let's make- let's make a few sales, huh?
[39:22.55]I get 18 cases here.
[39:23.69]Look at that!
[39:26.85]Let's do it.
[39:27.77]Oh fuck, I can haggle!
[39:29.73]Wait.
[39:32.43]Hey, can I have that back?
[39:34.94]Give me that back, please.
[39:35.78]I'd like- I'd like a refund.
[39:38.05]Oh, you'd like to return?
[39:39.05]You'd like a refill?
[39:40.59]Yeah, I'd like to.
[39:41.17]Let's cancel that transaction, please.
[39:43.07]And can we do it again?
[39:43.89]But I'd love to do business with you.
[39:45.13]Your prices are ridiculous.
[39:46.89]God damn it.
[39:48.67]Alright.
[39:49.07]How do I make the peanuts?
[39:52.05]This is what they're making right now.
[39:53.83]Change that recipe.
[39:54.59]I want to make peanuts.
[39:56.29]Chocolate bars with peanuts.
[39:58.34]Use this one.
[39:59.54]Good luck.
[40:00.66]Alright.
[40:00.88]I got to make this one good.
[40:03.72]Mr. Green returns.
[40:05.48]So this is just peanut.
[40:07.40]Here we go.
[40:09.16]I'm going to try to do this fast.
[40:17.32]Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[40:24.87]Don't.
[40:28.49]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[40:34.33]He's going to speed it up on me.
[40:35.15]He's speeding up.
[40:51.80]More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more!
[40:54.16]More!
[40:55.04]More!
[40:57.70]Oh, fuck, I keep thinking that's the end.
[40:58.94]Can you imagine, like, a guy in a factory sitting there screaming that?
[41:12.95]It's like, we can only go so fast.
[41:14.41]More!
[41:15.11]More!
[41:17.69]More!
[41:18.81]More!
[41:25.37]He's in a PA system too.
[41:27.03]He's not even down there.
[41:28.97]He's up with the glass wall looking down.
[41:32.13]I want more!
[41:40.09]More!
[41:41.42]More peanuts!
[41:43.20]More chocolate!
[41:44.10]Go faster!
[41:45.58]More!
[41:48.96]That guy's a fucking asshole.
[41:53.58]Does he know that these machines are automated?
[41:57.87]We're maintaining the machines.
[41:59.15]We're making sure everything works.

[48:58.53]34.
[49:00.59]Table Mountain.
[49:02.53]Delicious!
[49:03.49]Listen, I understand that Verena Zubrigan has been stocking all kinds of new ingredients.
[49:08.42]I imagine you may just find some new useful things on your next visit.
[49:16.04]What?
[49:16.98]I just got a tip and I didn't even fucking pay attention.
[49:20.65]I just have so much.
[49:27.25]I just, that was like 10, $20,000.
[49:28.69]What did they just say?
[49:34.94]What do they, what did they just say?
[49:37.40]I just was staring at that person with my mouth open and they told me something very important that I just got back on the plane.
[49:43.66]I wouldn't even paying attention.
[49:46.02]What was it?
[49:47.54]I wasn't paying attention either.
[49:54.79]What did the game just say?
[50:01.98]Somebody had to have been paying attention to what the game said.
[50:04.74]I was tabbed out.
[50:05.68]What?
[50:06.20]Tab back in.
[50:06.88]Help.
[50:08.16]Go to the factory.
[50:10.20]The factory here?
[50:17.32]Oh.
[50:18.30]Oh no.

[50:27.44]Hold on.
[50:27.70]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[50:32.17]You're just the person I've been looking for.
[50:33.65]I happen to have a glut of sugar I'm trying to offload.
[50:37.65]I'd be willing to exchange a thousand sacks of sugar for a mere 18 cases of chocolate bars with mint.
[50:43.24]Does that make a deal?
[50:44.00]Let's make a deal.
[50:48.28]Oh, I have to buy the mint from you.
[50:50.76]Oh, I see.
[50:53.51]But this is... So I have to like just buy mint from you and come back and... And you give me all your sugar.
[51:01.52]What you meant to say is you have a glut of mint.
[51:04.86]And you don't care about the sugar because it's so cheap.
[51:07.82]So you're going to mind game me into buying a shitload of the expensive herb from you.
[51:13.14]To then think that I'm going to come back and get a lot of the cheap thing that you don't care about.
[51:17.65]Well.
[51:19.37]Do I look like a fool?
[51:27.68]He wants 18 cases.
[51:29.60]Well, I think we can make some money with this, so I'm going to get 30 cases.
[51:33.98]No, more than that.
[51:35.10]Let's make some mint.
[51:40.72]50 cases.
[51:41.88]No.
[51:43.48]Enough for two weeks.
[51:45.02]And I usually make around 15 to 18.
[51:46.86]Let's just say like 40 cases.
[51:53.33]Okay, how much sugar do I have?
[51:54.93]While I'm here, I might as well get some milk.
[52:04.29]Last seen 32 to 42.
[52:05.33]89 to 111.
[52:06.65]That's expensive.
[52:10.56]Hazelnuts.
[52:13.22]152 in Cape Town.
[52:14.90]So what's going on here?
[52:20.54]That's good for milk.
[52:21.34]I'm going to get 100.
[52:21.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[52:24.26]I'm going to get fucking 500.
[52:25.76]Is that too much?
[52:26.78]300.
[52:27.90]Is that too much?
[52:34.39]200 is probably 200.
[52:35.23]And how am I?
[52:40.77]Alright, I'm good.
[52:41.43]I'm good.
[52:41.65]I'm good.
[52:42.63]Let's go back and get the recipe for the mint.
[52:45.47]Come back and get a thousand.
[52:48.16]This is running out.
[52:48.76]What the hell is this?
[52:58.30]Is this a guy on the plane sitting next to me?
[53:01.92]Thank you.
[53:03.36]Why is that guy, like, slug-worthing me?
[53:15.43]Get out of here.
[53:20.05]I don't care about your, like, weird... He's gonna tempt me with something later.
[53:22.77]He's gonna be like, let me tell you something.

[60:12.74]I'm so bad at that.
[60:24.72]I have caramel.
[60:25.94]I want these lemons.
[60:27.88]Previously seen for $100.
[60:29.82]In Zurich for $100.
[60:32.26]Why is it $181 now?
[60:41.71]I'll get a few oranges.

[61:10.86]I know.
[61:11.16]Who cares?
[61:12.14]They told me to bring ingredients.
[61:18.78]Why?
[61:19.14]I just bought one.
[61:20.16]I just wanted one because I want to bring one to Iceland.
[61:23.30]Let's go.
[61:30.08]Secret test kitchen.
[61:32.68]What?
[61:34.42]This is like a sad.
[61:35.66]I don't like this.
[61:36.72]Can we say, can we help him?
[61:37.80]This is like, I don't, that's like a really, really making me sad.
[61:46.34]Save him.
[61:46.98]I can't.
[61:57.97]Uncle Felix speaks quite highly of you, silly zonkabonka.
[62:01.45]We have a sophisticated operation here, where you will be able to create your own recipes.
[62:06.04]We offer feedback on the marketability of your inventions, and you can name and design your products.
[62:10.90]I hope it's scrumptious.
[62:13.32]Once your recipes are entered into the corporate recipe book, you'll be free to manufacture, and of course sell, your own creations.
[62:19.25]With success, you'll be given the chance to create more recipes, and stay on track to earn the board's endorsement as CEO.
[62:26.84]It looks like you have some ingredients we haven't seen before.
[62:29.45]We'll grab one sack of each, so it'll be available for use in our test kitchens.
[62:34.13]Oh, I can't wait for you to make the most scrumptious chocolate.
[62:37.87]Alright, select the ingredients to use from the drawers.
[62:40.53]Click taste it, and we'll give you some feedback on what you got.
[62:43.13]Alright, what we got?
[62:43.95]Coffee.
[62:49.86]This is the only thing I have?
[62:50.74]Oh, okay.
[62:53.44]Alright, taste this.
[62:58.95]Alright, chocolate, chocolate, just triple chocolate.
[63:03.22]Without something to sweeten it, raw cacao has a bitter taste.
[63:06.22]Try something sweeter.
[63:07.72]No, only chocolate.
[63:13.50]Dairy.
[63:16.08]Without a little variety in your recipe, you may as well be selling raw ingredients.
[63:21.06]Alright, fruits, sugar, nuts, flavors.
[63:23.46]Okay, how about chocolate, double chocolate, with
[63:32.38]Lemon.
[63:33.96]This combination works for me!
[63:35.22]Ooh!
[63:37.12]Next step is design, name, and describe your creation.
[63:40.99]Dark chocolate double... double chocolate with lemon.
[63:48.59]What the fuck?
[63:49.27]Alright, I like it when it has the little slots on it.
[63:55.83]This would be weird.
[64:00.58]It's a lemon bar.
[64:01.60]Oh!
[64:06.03]Lemon?
[64:06.45]It's going to be orange in the middle.
[64:08.09]Oh, look at that.
[64:08.71]Hold on.
[64:16.01]Look at that.
[64:16.79]Hold on.
[64:17.15]It's going to be bright yellow.
[64:18.91]Like that.
[64:26.26]It's just like a piece of coal.
[64:28.54]It's just a piece of charcoal.
[64:36.55]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[64:37.99]Ooh, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.
[64:42.13]And this is going to be like crunchies.
[64:43.89]No, should there be no crunchies on it?
[64:47.59]No crunchies.
[64:48.15]It's just a lemon bar.
[64:53.77]I love the divots too.
[64:54.71]Yep, the divots are perfect.
[64:58.90]And that in the middle, it's viscous in the middle.
[65:05.13]Dark chocolate and lemon.
[65:06.55]Name your recipe.
[65:09.41]Um... Lemon, uh... Lemon head.
[65:15.77]That already exists.

[91:58.02]Alright, I'm going to go to... I need to get cocoa.
[92:03.86]We're going to travel to Douala.
[92:08.35]I understand that Felix Baumeister has finally got his coffee machines up and running.
[92:11.35]You should make your way to Cape Town Manufacturing.
[92:13.77]Visit him as soon as you're able to.
[92:18.56]It's like Tobey Maguire.
[92:29.65]Your prices keep going up.
[92:32.01]It was 11, then it was 29, and now it's 33.
[92:33.19]35.
[92:33.21]Okay, okay.
[92:49.27]I see, you know what?
[92:49.99]I seem to recall slightly better prices at your competitors.
[92:53.37]You, a week ago.
[93:01.66]She knows your business is nothing without her.
[93:04.02]She wants her cut.
[93:11.50]It's true.
[93:12.00]I mean, it's true.
[93:18.31]She knows that your business is nothing.
[93:22.27]I'll take 200.
[93:22.83]This sugar is... Wow.
[93:27.27]Wow.
[93:28.23]I'll take a thousand of them.
[93:30.35]No, I'll take... I'll take... 2,000.
[93:35.06]I'll take 3,000.
[93:38.40]I'll never have to buy sugar again.
[93:47.23]Ballmeister Confections?
[93:48.25]I thought I heard that they had converted all their factories to manufacture munitions for the war effort.
[93:56.15]Ooh.
[93:57.82]Now we got a buyer here.
[94:00.22]Orange.
[94:01.14]They love oranges in Douala, apparently.
[94:03.24]This is $400 a case.
[94:08.71]I'm not selling the almonds.
[94:17.18]Maybe I should.
[94:19.50]Previously seen for 164 to 164.
[94:21.10]No.
[94:21.26]I'm going to try Cape Town.
[94:28.60]You don't know anything about a secret test kitchen where Bowmaster Confections is working on developing new recipes, do you?
[94:34.74]You know way too much.
[94:37.88]Okay.

[95:02.58]Wow.
[95:04.24]I think I turned the hand crank well enough.
[95:11.06]I love those things, by the way.
[95:15.65]Congrats, you piece of shit.
[95:16.93]Alright, how much are you willing to pay?
[95:21.15]Oh boy.
[95:22.91]Oh boy, this is a lot of money we're gonna haggle here.
[95:27.57]You think you could see your way to offering me a bit more for these products?
[95:32.02]I expected to hear better prices from you, my friend.
[95:34.92]Alright, let's do it.
[95:42.16]I have 36 cases of this shit.

[103:44.72]Here we go.
[103:45.22]Silly Zonka Wonka.
[103:46.02]We've already received an order for 20 cases of our first coffee product.
[103:48.92]Cup of Jill.
[103:51.28]He's willing to share a new coffee recipe in exchange for these coffees.
[103:55.60]I'm going to check out my coffee machines.
[103:57.62]Click to make coffee.
[103:58.98]Crank them up.
[104:01.18]Oh, shit.
[104:01.80]Here we go.
[104:04.02]Sugar, cream, and a hot dog bun.
[104:06.60]Use this one.
[104:07.24]Make coffee.
[104:08.95]Aim and fire ingredients to form rows of at least three ingredients on the moving conveyor belt.
[104:13.05]Wait, hold on.
[104:14.01]I have to comprehend this.
[104:19.01]Matched ingredients will fill the coffee-making machinery on the right.
[104:23.15]Matches of more than three ingredients in a row will earn bonuses.
[104:27.51]Um, alright.
[104:28.63]I... Yeah, is this...
[104:34.24]I need to see how it works.
[104:42.29]Wait, what's going on?
[104:43.91]Oh, God.
[104:49.29]Wait, it's... Okay, so you just have to match them up.
[105:00.48]What?
[105:00.66]What?
[105:09.65]Come on.
[105:09.95]I get it.
[105:10.21]I get it.
[105:10.47]I get it.

[105:11.55]Sugar.
[105:11.73]Sugar.
[105:11.91]Sugar.
[105:12.09]Sugar.
[105:12.27]Sugar.
[105:12.45]Sugar.
[105:12.61]Sugar.
[105:12.95]Sugar.
[105:15.19]I get it.
[105:15.51]I get it.
[105:15.75]I understand it.
[105:23.14]Oh, fuck.
[105:23.70]I hate this.
[105:25.92]It's... Okay.
[105:29.02]Hot dog.
[105:29.40]Hot dog.
[105:29.74]Hot dog.
[105:30.04]Hot dog.
[105:30.36]I need more.
[105:32.18]Oh, fuck.
[105:32.62]I need...
[105:40.52]24 cases.
[105:41.70]I'm doing so terribly, but I'm getting a lot.
[105:44.90]27 cases?
[105:55.09]Nice.
[105:55.67]Okay.
[105:56.87]Low on coffee.
[105:58.33]Oh, shit.
[106:00.23]Jet!
[106:08.04]You can sell coffee too.
[106:09.02]Alright, cool.
[106:11.90]So now we have to go back to Zurich.
[106:14.64]I'm almost out of caramel.
[106:17.18]I gotta stop making money, guys.
[106:18.54]I gotta make some money.
[106:23.87]Silly Zonkabonka.
[106:25.85]I keep thinking he's talking about the Trix rabbit.
[106:28.44]Wait, what?
[106:28.90]Australia.
[106:29.40]That's gonna be like a million dollars to get there.
[106:52.70]So you have taken the plunge and begin to manufacture coffee products.
[106:55.26]As I promised Felix, in exchange for 20 cases, I'd like to give you this recipe for mocha.
[107:00.08]One of my favorite hot drinks.
[107:01.58]Ooh, this one is cocoa, milk, and hot dogs.
[107:06.82]Nice.
[107:07.58]I can't wait to make my own custom coffee.
[107:12.20]We gotta change this.
[107:12.78]How much are lemons?
[107:16.18]Honey?
[107:16.44]It's so expensive still.
[107:20.18]Why do you hate me?
[107:22.70]I really want a coffee now.
[107:24.24]I'm drinking one right now.
[107:28.00]Alright.
[107:30.46]That's worth it.
[107:31.80]Holy shit, I have 67 cases.
[107:36.76]Hey, you gotta make some money, right?
[107:38.55]Bang.
[107:40.65]That's a huge sell right there.
[107:43.47]36 cases of this coffee.
[107:45.97]You know what?
[107:47.15]I got a new product here.
[107:52.58]You motherfucker.
[107:54.04]Alright, well, I got to change this away from caramel.
[108:02.60]What we got?
[108:07.41]Hazelnut.
[108:07.81]This is probably going to be very expensive.
[108:13.03]How many do I have?
[108:13.55]I have 153 almonds.
[108:13.97]I could do almonds.
[108:16.27]I could do oranges.
[108:21.27]Out of lemons.
[108:23.27]This is raspberry, nice.
[108:26.07]What about my creation?
[108:27.11]The hell is this?
[108:35.30]Infusions?
[108:37.96]What is all this?
[108:38.56]Alright, cool.
[108:40.62]Yours sucks.
[108:45.54]Play the game with your feet.
[108:47.46]What the fuck are you talking about?
[108:50.81]I'm going to do almonds.
[108:52.07]I have a lot of almonds.
[108:52.85]Let's use this one.
[108:55.93]I need to get more coffee.
[109:02.33]Take only one week to get to Australia?
[109:07.46]I wonder if they like coffee in Australia.
[109:09.34]Do they sell?
[109:10.58]They might sell coffee beans in Australia.
[109:16.50]Limes?
[109:18.80]Ooh.
[109:24.13]I want one.
[109:27.93]Be careful around here, silly zonkawonka.
[109:29.47]Not everyone can be trusted.
[109:36.19]I'm glad to see you again, silly zonkawonka.
[109:38.63]I've not found out much yet, but I have good reason to believe that Sean is still alive.
[109:43.52]The board of directors is most pleased with the market's reaction to your tart of the moon, and we've decided to award you another space in our corporate recipe book.
[109:52.87]Excellent.
[109:54.39]Test kitchen time.
[109:55.07]Let's go.
[109:59.81]You need to be sure to create new recipes as you are awarded spaces in the recipe book.
[110:04.32]This would be a critical part of proving to the board that you are capable of being our CEO.
[110:08.63]Also, you will find wonderful wild limes here at Kawaki's Limes.
[110:14.23]This is the only place in the world where you can buy limes.
[110:18.65]Keep up the great work.
[110:19.49]I hope you have some more news soon.
[110:20.83]This is the only place in the world.
[110:23.85]In the world.
[110:27.27]How do you haggle with somebody that... How do you haggle with somebody that has the only inventory on Earth?
[110:45.43]This is one of my favorite places to buy ingredients as your prices are... No, it's not my favorite.
[110:50.89]One of my favorites.
[110:51.67]It's the only favorite because none of them exist.
[110:55.97]Times are tougher.
[110:56.49]They're tough for everyone.
[110:58.71]Beg.
[110:59.47]You're charging tourist prices here.
[111:02.01]Do something for me.
[111:06.49]Beg?
[111:06.81]I'm not gonna beg.
[111:26.43]no 400 at least I got one what's wrong oh I need coffee I could fly across the whole world to get coffee no I need to go to what was I doing a test kitchen
[111:50.50]But first.
[111:55.36]Damn it, she still hates me.
[111:56.42]Flat Earth.
[112:03.50]God damn it.
[112:06.58]Okay, hold on.
[112:08.77]I've got plenty of almonds.
[112:11.65]That's fine.
[112:12.29]I need to do something with somebody here.
[112:20.79]Buy the honey.
[112:27.71]Oh, this hurts to buy that many.
[112:32.80]I'm seriously, this lady is taking so much of my money.
[112:35.44]Alright, test kitchen.
[112:39.70]I got a lot of ingredients to go to the test kitchen with.
[112:42.48]I got cream.
[112:43.30]I'm going to do chocolate, cream, lime.
[112:46.87]I'm going to call it the urinal cake.
[112:50.08]He almost said banana.
[112:53.79]Okay.
[113:00.39]Cape Town.
[113:02.07]No.
[113:02.51]First I have to get more beans.
[113:04.94]This is the only place in the world I can get beans.
[113:06.50]I'm going for it.
[113:11.46]Okay.
[113:11.64]I had a feeling!
[113:30.66]You were expanding into coffees based on those ingredients you purchased from me a while back.
[113:35.58]I'd be willing to give you $25,000 if you deliver 75 cases a cup of Joe and 75 cases of mocha here to me.
[113:42.08]What do you say?
[113:42.67]What?
[113:43.15]That's not enough.
[113:44.91]75 cases.
[113:48.83]Oh, that's bullshit.
[114:02.68]Price went up.

[124:26.42]Now I need hazelnuts.
[124:29.83]Do I have hazelnuts?
[124:31.87]I don't have any.
[124:32.43]Do you sell hazelnut here?
[124:34.79]You do for an insane price.
[124:37.11]No.
[124:38.73]Sorry.

[124:47.92]I need to make mocha.
[124:48.74]Alright, we're gonna go to... We're gonna go down here.
[124:52.85]I'm gonna turn this into mocha.
[124:57.15]Things are starting to finally get back to normal after the war.
[124:59.59]I've been seeing new ingredients in stock in markets all over the world.
[125:03.01]Oh, cool.
[125:05.37]Haggling is tricky, but buying low and selling high is a secret.
[125:09.59]You've successfully invented your new product.
[125:11.53]You've launched our new line of coffees.
[125:12.99]I'm glad to see how well things are going for the company.
[125:17.56]You need to earn the respect of all the board members.
[125:21.68]As soon as you've been able to learn and manufacture five coffee recipes, as well as taking over at least one retail location, you have my endorsement.
[125:28.17]Okay.
[125:30.31]Oh, one other thing.
[125:31.89]Florian Emiel was most pleased with a cup of Joe and has placed an order for 75 cases of mocha.
[125:37.42]He's going to pay $50,000.
[125:38.06]Um, yes.

[127:12.07]Has the cost of travel gone up lately?
[127:15.78]That's not good.
[127:21.34]I could sell this right now.
[127:22.79]That's pretty good.
[127:24.49]That's pretty good for this.
[127:26.93]Chocolate with almond?
[127:28.35]That's the highest price I've ever seen.
[127:30.15]I'm going for it.
[127:37.32]Here we go.
[127:37.74]That's the most money I've ever had.
[127:41.30]What about regular coffee?
[127:42.24]Nah, 565.
[127:42.58]What do you got?
[127:49.54]I need hazelnuts.
[127:50.72]That's not a bad price for hazelnuts.
[128:01.48]Your prices do seem pretty fair.
[128:03.82]Can you offer me a slight discount?
[128:06.29]No, I'm not pushing it.
[128:11.03]Need to make chocolate with hazelnut.

[135:19.42]She's going to track me down, isn't she?
[135:27.73]Didn't she say, I'm going to track you down?
[135:33.01]Okay.
[135:34.39]Almost at a quarter million.
[135:36.09]Pretty good.
[135:41.29]I want to make...
[135:44.87]I want to make my sprite sponges.
[135:46.82]I can't.
[135:55.40]I can make coffee here, too.
[135:59.91]What can I make that's not going to have to worry about for the next few weeks?
[136:04.97]It's hazelnut.
[136:05.71]It has to be hazelnut or oranges.
[136:08.59]I could do orange.
[136:09.55]Just let it run.
[136:11.60]I'm going to keep that.
[136:12.30]The hazelnut market is currently crazy right now.
[136:15.00]So we're going to keep it on hazelnut.
[136:16.02]Alright.
[136:19.29]I'm almost out of milk.
[136:27.07]Am I out of milk or is that cream?
[136:37.78]What is that?
[136:41.52]I think it's milk.
[136:43.92]Alright, I'm gonna go... We're gonna take a trip.
[136:46.20]I need to get more coffee anyways.
[136:48.92]I need limes, first of all.
[136:51.66]Let's go get a bunch.
[136:53.96]Here we go.
[136:54.39]There it is.
[137:05.32]Listen, since you'll be on your way there soon, are you willing to deliver 12 cases of chocolate bars with orange to Jilali Abilu there?
[137:14.34]He will pay you handsomely.
[137:16.68]Um, sure.
[137:23.38]Oh, what happened?
[137:27.50]What happened?
[137:28.16]It's the only place you can buy them.
[137:32.30]What happened?
[137:40.23]I just bought a thousand limes.
[137:41.29]Is it my imagination or has the cost of travel increased?
[138:00.41]How do I take a location?
[138:02.05]Buy more?
[138:08.16]That's too much limes, I think.
[138:12.05]Alright, let's see.
[138:12.49]Okay, let's try to haggle.
[138:14.27]Because if I can... I already got a thousand at that good price.
[138:16.65]If she goes up, it doesn't matter.
[138:17.81]I already got a thousand of them.
[138:21.11]I know that your prices are not set in stone.
[138:24.98]What a marvelous day.
[138:28.02]I know that your prices are not set in stone.
[138:31.14]I wasn't born yesterday.
[138:32.04]My prices are reasonable.
[138:35.56]Please, please, please, please.
[138:38.50]Get what you pay for.
[138:45.16]Give me a better dealer I walk.
[138:47.58]Buzz off.
[138:48.60]I don't care.
[138:49.15]I already bought a thousand of them.
[138:51.83]I'm just seeing if you're going to go lower.
[138:53.87]Because if you were, I would have bought more.
[138:55.31]But look at the price I already got them at.
[138:57.35]No returns.
[138:58.19]No refunds.
[138:59.65]You can't just add the price retroactively.
[139:01.25]I already got them.
[139:01.97]Bye.
[139:03.03]And by the way, hi.
[139:04.55]I never have to come back here again.
[139:06.47]I bought a thousand of them.
[139:15.14]Taryn.
[139:18.18]I need coffee.
[139:19.18]I gotta... Wait.
[139:22.24]Okay.
[139:22.65]I cannot go here without orange chocolate.
[139:25.59]So we're not going there yet.
[139:27.41]I have to fly to... Shit.
[139:30.93]Okay.
[139:33.01]I need lemons.
[139:34.49]We have to start lemon production.

[139:59.96]I've made all that I can make here.
[140:01.36]Here we go.
[140:22.38]Come on, give me a stack.

[140:31.53]Come on!
[140:55.34]stack.
[140:58.86]Got it.
[140:59.18]Okay, good.
[141:03.20]Give me no stack.
[141:13.89]Uh, whatever.
[141:17.53]Filthy mouth sound waves.
[141:19.01]20 is fine.
[141:23.33]Alright, so this is going to just be punching my sprite sponges.
[141:27.44]So now doesn't somebody really like to buy new shit?
[141:30.38]Who is it?
[141:32.70]It's not you, is it?
[141:33.44]That's all that's worth?
[141:52.65]Sell one.
[141:58.74]It's a shitty product.
[142:19.19]Okay.
[142:20.13]Um, I need chocolate bars with orange.
[142:25.35]I gotta get coffee.
[142:26.11]Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee.
[142:27.37]Coffee first.
[142:28.11]Coffee first.
[142:28.78]Coffee, coffee, coffee.
[142:36.00]You literally made a fucking sponge.
[142:37.36]Yeah, but they don't know that until they eat it.
[142:39.28]Fuck, these suck.
[142:49.97]Cheap hazelnuts.
[142:52.21]I think, yeah.
[142:58.62]Can you come down again?
[142:59.56]Can you come down again?
[143:01.60]Give me a break.
[143:07.18]Okay.
[143:07.92]That's a big break.
[143:09.66]I have to buy a thousand.
[143:14.13]I'm going to say 500.
[143:22.77]More than that.
[143:24.11]I can afford it.
[143:29.23]It's very cheap.
[143:32.22]Okay.
[143:33.50]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[143:35.04]We're fine, we're fine.
[143:35.62]I got a ton of coffee now.
[143:41.11]Money's gone.
[143:42.15]It'll come right back when I sell 500 cases of coffee.
[143:49.69]Alright, now I gotta go back to...
[143:53.24]Ooh.
[143:56.06]They love coffee here, don't they?
[143:57.54]We're going to go sell the mocha.
[143:59.72]I have a ton of it.
[144:01.32]I have a ton of it.
[144:06.28]Oh, my God.
[144:07.46]You all thought I was not going to make out like an absolute bandit.
[144:10.15]534.
[144:10.51]Look at that.
[144:24.58]I'm not fucking around.
[144:27.57]I'll take the 50 grand.
[144:28.69]Should I sell the sponges?
[144:35.23]I have to.
[144:35.75]They're terrible.
[144:39.99]Whoa.
[144:43.55]Cayenne pepper?

[144:50.99]What would I- Chocolate hot pepper chocolate?
[144:58.44]This is a big investment.
[145:00.82]This is a huge... That's a major investment.
[145:03.98]Okay.
[145:13.99]We're doing hot... Hot pepper chocolate.
[145:21.02]What do you mean, scammed?
[145:21.80]What are you talking about?
[145:22.68]This is like an insane item.
[145:23.98]Wait, did I... Was I not supposed to... Wait, that's a lot.
[145:28.27]They're a hot item right now.
[145:31.27]Make prank chocolate.
[145:33.17]Just pepper.
[145:33.91]Okay, what if I just made pepper, pepper, pepper.
[145:37.01]Pepper, pepper, milk chocolate and just burn people's mouths.
[145:42.54]Wait.
[145:44.97]We've got a deal.
[145:45.41]Here's the recipe for cafe con leche.
[145:47.47]Oh.
[145:47.59]My.
[145:47.77]God.
[145:47.97]We've got Cuban coffee.
[145:48.91]Uh-huh.
[146:11.90]When you get to Havana, track down China Famosa at Havana Coffee Beans.
[146:15.84]You can buy the coffee beans you'll need from her.
[146:26.01]Okay.
[146:28.41]But I need to... Alright, I don't want to run out of money.
[146:34.19]I need to bring this person... Alright, we gotta get milk, and then these coffee beans.
[146:41.92]Milk.
[146:44.24]Do you sell milk here?
[146:46.36]No.
[146:46.54]I need milk.
[146:50.49]Whoa, whoa.
[146:52.81]And please report that I'm ready to harvest a new crop of... A new crop of cocoa.
[146:58.67]I will sell some of my wonderful crops to you if you're willing to take an order from a 25 cases of special reserve 66% African cacao.
[147:06.23]Do not worry.
[147:06.67]You'll be well compensated.
[147:08.44]Let's go.
[147:25.60]Holy shit.
[147:26.12]Alright.
[147:28.30]I'm going to lose money.
[147:29.20]I'm going to run out of money.
[147:32.02]I have a bunch of quests I need to get back to.
[147:33.72]Don't buy any yet.
[147:34.42]Why not?
[147:37.04]Alright.
[147:38.12]I have to get this.
[147:39.20]Let me slow down.
[147:40.99]Back to Zerk.
[147:46.64]You got milk here?
[147:47.48]You do.
[147:48.26]Alright.
[147:53.38]That's not a bad price.
[147:54.20]I need money.
[147:59.64]And just get rid of this junk.
[148:06.21]Alright, I need... Talk to Felix Baumeister at Cape Town...
[148:15.89]Oh, okay.
[148:18.41]Orange bars.
[148:19.13]I need to make orange chocolate bars.
[148:22.77]And then I need to talk to this person in Cuba.
[148:26.50]And then make 25 cases of a special reserve 66%.
[148:29.68]We're going to do that now.
[148:32.24]Over the course of the next week or two.
[148:34.92]So let's start the production on... Can I get rid of this Nickelodeon gack and just throw it away?
[148:41.92]How do I delete these recipes?
[148:43.40]They're horrendous.
[148:44.36]They're awful.
[148:51.62]This thing's... This is probably really expensive.
[148:54.04]Alright.
[148:55.88]Orange chocolate.
[148:56.82]I have enough to do it.
[148:57.74]Let's just make one.
[148:59.64]Let's just make it.
[149:00.16]Come on, one more.
[149:31.05]Shit So always one step behind always one step behind Always one step behind
[150:06.15]Alright, whatever.
[150:06.77]He's just like me.
[150:14.77]Feels bad, man.
[150:15.99]What?
[150:16.15]Alright, so I need to bring... 12 bars.
[150:23.99]How many do I have?
[150:25.57]Oh.
[150:27.91]Please, Anka Wonka, Alexandra, and the other members of the board have noticed how well your creations are doing in the market.
[150:33.33]And so they have decided to award you another space in the recipe book.
[150:35.89]Alright, this one's not going to be fucking gross.
[150:41.09]This one's not going to be disgusting.
[150:42.25]I'm going to make one that actually has flavor.
[150:45.49]It isn't just milk and lemons and limes.
[150:48.75]Or just no sugar or anything.
[150:49.87]I'm going to make a good chocolate.
[150:51.33]A good one.
[150:51.81]Okay.
[150:57.28]But first.
[151:00.25]And pause the game.
[151:00.83]We're going to take a break.
[151:02.41]I'm going to go pee.
[151:03.73]Be right back.
[154:55.46]Hello.
[154:59.52]So I want to just go over something very quickly.
[155:01.56]If you didn't, if you weren't here yesterday, I currently am on a new medication, my stomach.
[155:08.91]And I'm getting some side effects.
[155:11.38]Very, very minor, but they're annoying.
[155:14.14]So I probably... I'm probably going to call it here.
[155:18.92]In the next like 25 minutes or so.
[155:20.46]I don't want to go too much today.
[155:22.50]Just went downstairs and drank some water.
[155:26.47]I'm just like, okay.
[155:29.23]You shat your pants.
[155:30.23]I did not.
[155:31.43]I did not.
[155:33.61]But so I kind of really like this game.
[155:37.69]I was going to do Connect tomorrow.
[155:38.91]But I think I'm just going to play this tomorrow too.
[155:44.47]I kind of want to get to a million dollars.
[155:51.41]I can save the game.
[155:52.09]Yeah, okay.
[155:55.75]And don't worry.
[155:56.77]We'll do Connect Friday.
[156:00.17]But yeah, I just want to... As I kind of get used to this new medication, I'm just going to kind of chill.
[156:08.17]I really only planned on going about three-ish hours today.
[156:12.89]We'll call it here soon.
[156:13.87]I didn't want to not stream today because I didn't stream yesterday.
[156:16.91]And it was just like, oh, okay.
[156:17.93]Well, I'm just going to... One week break Andy every other week.
[156:23.28]I know.
[156:24.04]Seriously.
[156:26.28]But I didn't want to not stream today.
[156:28.50]And I feel fine.
[156:29.54]Don't worry.
[156:29.90]This is not like a problem or anything.
[156:31.24]I'm just... Currently, I have some minor side effects of the medication, so... Break Andy.
[156:39.76]Let's do this for a little bit longer.
[156:41.64]I'm very invested in my chocolate company.
[156:44.18]I cannot wait to play this tomorrow.
[156:46.34]I'm not going to touch it, I promise.
[156:47.52]I'm not going to play off stream.
[156:49.26]I'm going to get the itch to, but I'm not going to.
[156:53.34]Let's keep going.
[156:54.38]Dermakinda.
[156:56.60]Dermakinda.
[156:58.78]Kinda.
[157:02.99]Can you not see?
[157:03.51]I mean, you can't see.
[157:06.55]That's weird.
[157:16.86]Oh, that's why.
[157:17.36]Okay.
[157:19.00]Kind of snack.
[157:24.56]There we go.
[157:28.54]Alright.
[157:29.20]12 cases of chocolate bars with orange.
[157:31.10]I just got that.
[157:31.86]Now we got... I only need to send 12.
[157:34.74]So I can sell... 18, 76, 54, 13, 12.
[157:35.67]I can sell 7.
[157:36.35]Okay.
[157:37.21]That's that quest.
[157:47.61]Now I need to bring this one.
[157:49.91]25 cases of special reserve.
[157:52.13]Let's do that right now.
[157:55.54]Special reserve.
[157:57.94]Use this one.
[157:58.80]Alright, this one's going to be very expensive.
[158:06.94]This recipe should be easy, by the way.
[158:14.15]Statistically speaking, I should be able to do it without having to move.
[158:20.87]Kinda, right?
[158:34.53]It's going too fast.
[158:38.28]I'm having trouble aiming more than I am actually the recipe.
[158:43.00]It's going way too fucking fast.
[158:52.31]Slow it down.
[158:53.05]Slow it down, please.
[158:58.57]They don't want you to get more than like 25.
[159:00.47]They really don't.
[159:09.70]More, more, more.
[159:12.20]Okay, so I have 25.
[159:12.90]How much are these worth?
[159:14.18]They're worth a lot.
[159:19.34]I can sell one.
[159:22.66]Okay, quest.
[159:24.28]I've got 25 cases.
[159:26.32]I just have to go to cube.
[159:27.28]There's a lot of travel going on.
[159:28.56]I need more of those special beans.
[159:35.21]I need milk.
[159:38.37]What do you got?
[159:38.75]A little more.
[159:44.01]Another 100.
[159:44.25]Alright, I got plenty.
[159:46.81]How much coffee do I have?
[159:47.61]Alright, more milk.
[159:56.66]I'm gonna go here.
[159:57.40]We're gonna take a quick trip here so I can buy more of these beans.
[160:00.68]I've been waiting to taste what you have created for my cocoa.
[160:08.01]Delightful.
[160:08.71]Here's $40,000.
[160:09.89]Holy shit.
[160:12.77]Nice.
[160:13.09]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[160:15.27]That was a lot.
[160:17.20]That was for 25 cases.
[160:18.24]That was so... What a premium that was.
[160:22.56]They were 90 before.
[160:24.08]You can do better than that.
[160:24.86]No, you can't.
[160:25.44]That's not bad.
[160:27.76]We're gonna just constantly have production of this.
[160:36.29]Okay.
[160:36.93]We're gonna let that just run.
[160:42.87]We got a lot of mocha.
[160:43.79]They... Mocha's pretty popular here.
[160:45.44]I'm gonna sell the mocha.
[160:49.00]96.
[160:49.14]I gotta get a new coffee on the market here.
[160:53.96]I think people are getting sick of me selling them mocha.
[161:02.60]Oh shit, I can sell this right now.
[161:05.62]I don't think I want to do this right here.
[161:07.20]No, somewhere else.
[161:12.92]These peppers are so expensive.
[161:14.49]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[161:15.99]I got no almonds.
[161:16.99]This is a good price for an almond.
[161:21.93]Just regular cocoa, that's a lot.
[161:23.45]Alright, let's do the next quest.
[161:26.37]Which was, we are going to drop off this here.
[161:28.41]We haven't been here before.
[161:33.88]Okay.
[161:36.55]I had word of your arrival and your chocolates.
[161:38.01]Here's $15,000.
[161:38.63]Oh, scrumptious.
[161:41.97]$15,000.
[161:42.01]Good.
[161:44.71]We need new confections.
[161:45.69]What do we got?
[161:47.09]That's new.
[161:47.79]Moroccan coffee.
[161:48.67]$347.
[161:48.87]What?
[161:49.23]$347. $347.
[162:01.92]Ah, you're killing me.
[162:02.73]This is the good shit.
[162:03.57]I know it is.
[162:06.75]Alright, I'm gonna go broke if I don't relax.
[162:10.83]Greetings, Silly's Vankawanka.
[162:12.93]I'm not on the board, but I'm indeed a Tanguy.
[162:17.18]Alexandra is my younger sister.
[162:19.48]Alex suggests that you and I might find it mutually beneficial to work together.
[162:22.50]To start, I have a recipe here that uses our very own Moroccan coffee.
[162:26.80]I'm willing to hand you the recipe and pay you $10,000 in advance for an order of 40 cases.
[162:33.80]Sure.
[162:34.72]New recipe.
[162:35.76]Arabian Bold.
[162:39.10]Oh shit.
[162:45.28]Okay, cool.
[162:47.24]Maybe I should just say fuck chocolate and make coffee.
[162:53.84]I look forward to the delivery of the products.
[162:57.09]Ooh.
[162:57.89]This guy likes mocha.
[162:59.43]You love mocha.
[163:04.49]At a good price.
[163:05.19]Okay.
[163:08.67]What else can I do?
[163:09.09]At the port.
[163:10.35]What if I told you I was able to offer you a new ingredient to use in your recipes?
[163:14.32]Are you willing to bring me just two cases of chocolates if I let you know about a newly available ingredient?
[163:18.70]That sounds like a scam.
[163:24.76]Just two cases of chocolate.
[163:26.22]That's it.
[163:27.58]Well, what if I give him just a standard default chocolate?
[163:34.55]Okay, fine.
[163:39.51]Terrific.
[163:40.87]If you head over to Soog Market, you will find that Magdalene Gelder is now stocking raspberries.
[163:47.80]Use them to make chocolate bars with raspberry and be sure to come back with the two cases you promised.
[163:53.16]Oh, shit.
[163:55.11]Why did he have to say that for them to unlock?
[163:57.07]I was already here.
[164:04.76]Nice.
[164:05.28]That's expensive, but whatever.
[164:06.40]Okay, hold on.
[164:11.26]I just saw 80,000.
[164:11.66]We like to keep quite a bit of coffee around for our guests here at the Hotel Tangiers.
[164:16.98]We'll need to pay you a premium.
[164:18.78]$80,000.
[164:18.92]Once you deliver 65 cases of your Cup of Joe, Mocha, and Arabian Bold.
[164:24.92]Wait, 65 of each?
[164:26.06]Alright, Cup of Joe is cheap to make.
[164:35.08]Mocha's cheap to make.
[164:35.84]But Arabian Bold, that uses the new beans.
[164:38.38]That's not worth it.
[164:43.44]Oh.
[164:44.59]No, no deal.
[164:45.17]That's not worth it.
[164:55.58]I feel bad for this guy.
[164:57.82]He just wants two cases of chocolate with raspberry.
[164:59.87]I could just never come back here.
[165:03.59]Could I just not come back here again?
[165:04.99]Alright.
[165:11.07]What else do I got?
[165:13.47]Alright, Cuba.
[165:14.11]Right.
[165:14.30]We gotta go to Cuba.
[165:14.90]Let's go.
[165:15.32]Havana.
[165:19.16]Havana.
[165:27.57]Alright, we got Havana Coffee Beans.
[165:29.35]Shit.
[165:30.55]I have so much coffee.
[165:54.77]I don't have enough to do any of this stuff.
[165:56.21]I can do like... 40?
[165:56.75]50?
[165:57.27]Oh, it's a casino!
[166:07.64]We got some great slot machines in here, silly zonkawonka.
[166:10.98]But this is an exclusive casino.
[166:13.28]If you'd be willing to bring me 35 cases of your TARD OF THE MOON, I could see my way getting you on the list.
[166:19.24]You got a deal.
[166:21.45]You have absolutely a deal.
[166:22.79]I just have to bring 35 of my gross, unsweetened, disgusting chocolates to you?
[166:28.57]My specialty, and I get to play in the casino?
[166:30.33]Holy fuck.
[166:31.43]I cannot wait to do this.
[166:32.57]Ooh, allspice.
[166:36.87]Black tea.
[166:37.59]That's a lot for black tea.
[166:38.79]What?
[166:39.85]Alright.
[166:40.53]10.
[166:42.72]And 5.
[166:42.92]Too many ingredients.
[166:48.76]I've been hearing silly things about you.
[166:50.34]Whatever.
[167:00.16]No, I'm holding them.
[167:02.42]Alright.

[167:13.99]I'm not sure if you realize this, silly Zonkawonka, but ingredients do not last forever.
[167:20.11]What?
[167:21.75]If you are storing an ingredient that you are not using, it will expire and disappear from your inventory over time.
[167:28.09]Um...
[167:39.10]How long does it last?
[167:42.37]A thousand limes.
[167:47.07]The peppers.

[170:23.87]This combination works for me.
[170:27.86]Cuban Cayenne coffee with a hint of honey in it.
[170:44.18]Hazelnut Cuban coffee with a hint of honey.
[170:49.90]Why?
[170:59.11]Okay.
[171:01.83]Cuban coffee, Cayenne pepper, and cream.
[171:08.98]That's okay, but no.
[171:13.57]How about just plain old sugar?
[171:16.29]No, honey.
[171:16.95]I like this.
[171:23.49]Yeah, I think this is going to be delicious.
[171:29.29]Don't put coconut in it.
[171:30.21]Why would I put coconut in this?
[171:33.41]Go.
[171:35.54]Oh, shit.
[171:36.36]Okay, here we go.
[171:37.72]This is Cuban Cayenne honey.
[171:44.08]That base is going to be a dark cream.
[171:46.62]A nice dark Cuban coffee color.
[171:50.43]Like that.
[171:52.33]With the richness falling to the bottom of the glass.
[171:55.15]Should it be TV static?
[171:57.69]Yeah, I want the richness falling to the bottom.
[172:02.79]This is the beer you send back at the bar because the pour was horrible.
[172:09.02]Right there.
[172:09.34]Perfect.
[172:09.72]Perfect.
[172:13.24]I want that to... This is Cayenne, remember?

[172:19.29]Perfect.
[172:22.03]Is there whipped cream on this?
[172:22.95]There's honey on this.
[172:24.07]Wait, this is the top.
[172:26.31]Yeah, this is honey.
[172:29.93]Ooh!
[172:30.15]Okay, there's the honey.
[172:35.47]And this has to be kind of... This has to be like red too.
[172:41.43]Ooh, that looks spicy.
[172:44.17]Look at that.
[172:46.31]That looks pretty sick to me.
[172:55.44]That's Cayenne pepper flakes sprinkled on top of the Cuban coffee with a drizzle of honey on top to negate some of the harshness of the Cayenne peppers.
[173:15.93]I gotta give it a cool name.
[173:33.10]I can't.
[173:33.48]Whatever.
[173:33.80]It's not blood.
[173:38.30]It's Cayenne pepper flakes.
[173:41.17]Hey, grow up.
[173:42.45]Hey, grow up.

[174:09.87]Clock cleaner.
[174:16.24]The clock cleaner!
[174:18.65]The Cuban Clock Cleaner.
[174:21.21]This shit cleans your clock when you take a sip.
[174:34.61]Wait, you've never heard that term before?
[174:36.81]Like, you're gonna get your clock cleaned.
[174:39.03]It means you're gonna get, like, knocked over.
[174:40.40]Like, knocked out.
[174:44.94]Cleaning your clock.
[174:49.31]Wait, am I making this up?
[174:51.47]Let me look it up.
[174:53.66]Cleaning someone's clock.
[174:58.54]What does it mean?
[175:00.02]Give someone a beating.
[175:01.18]Defeat or surpass someone.
[175:04.27]Yeah, it means you're getting the shit kicked out of you.
[175:06.93]You're getting your clock cleaned.
[175:08.59]The Cuban clock cleaner.
[175:25.38]Why can I not have a longer description?
[175:27.26]I want to make like a stupid, just dumb marketing thing.
[175:45.45]Red, it's red, it's red, red, red.
[175:47.11]What?
[175:49.55]It's Cayenne pepper.
[176:17.07]That looks good to me.
[176:23.83]Cuban clock cleaner.
[176:26.21]Okay, for a second, I thought I didn't put Cuban beans in it.
[176:30.54]I can't wait to make this.
[176:31.16]Look at how expensive this ingredient is.
[176:33.22]This is a delicacy.
[176:34.04]This is going to go for like fucking five grand a pop.
[176:37.86]Let's go.
[176:44.26]Back to Cape Town.
[176:50.80]Here we go.
[176:51.81]Manufacturing.
[176:55.01]I'm very pleased with the way things are going.
[176:57.13]I hope you are as well.
[176:58.03]I understand that Lin Layana has a coffee recipe that may be quite valuable for us.
[177:03.13]I also know that he's a fan of Special Reserve 66.
[177:06.74]Would you take 34 cases?
[177:08.64]Yeah.

[177:20.57]Make it.
[177:25.84]The question is who is making- who's buying cases of pre-made coffee?
[177:29.16]I don't know.
[177:42.49]Shit.
[177:44.87]Oh my god, I fucked that up.
[177:58.55]Oh my god, this is actually hard to aim, by the way.

[178:05.61]There's a big one right here.
[178:19.91]Oh my god, it's so annoying to aim this lag on the cursor.

[178:26.95]Okay, wait.
[178:33.21]How am I low on everything?
[178:38.74]I have 34 of these.
