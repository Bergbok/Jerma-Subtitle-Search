[00:17.53]Are you kidding me?
[00:20.67]That's how far that goes?
[00:24.65]I'm fairly certain.
[00:25.51]Okay, throw a shuriken as far as you possibly can in the air.
[00:28.57]I'm pretty sure I can throw a rock farther than that.
[00:31.81]Yeah, it drops off real quick.
[00:33.25]That drops off real quick.
[00:35.47]Oh, I threw it like ten yards.
[00:36.79]Oh my god.
[00:37.57]That's the whole team.
[00:39.49]Oh my, oh my god.
[00:41.02]This entire team.
[00:43.12]Your arms are just really sore.
[00:44.54]It's okay.
[00:45.16]Oh my god.
[00:48.24]Yeah, I haven't paid attention.
[00:49.34]Is there only one banner that anybody can grab?
[00:51.40]Is it like in the middle and then we have to take it to our own?
[00:53.57]Yeah, it's like a giant.
[00:55.03]That's more fun than capture the flag to me.
[00:56.89]It's a giant like World of Warcraft staff.
[00:59.90]Yeah.
[01:00.20]Hey, don't mock my faction.
[01:02.64]God, I can't hit this guy!
[01:04.54]Fucking raw boner again.
[01:05.98]German, stop it!
[01:06.78]German!
[01:07.58]I'm a knight!
[01:08.54]Give me that staff.
[01:09.88]Give me that epic staff.
[01:11.38]Dammit.
[01:13.46]Plus five to dying because it makes you a giant target.
[01:16.94]Yeah, not really.
[01:18.30]Stupid knight.
[01:19.42]I just stabbed him in the eye with a shuriken because he sat there and did his battle cry.
[01:23.21]That guy just dropped a bomb down here.
[01:27.33]He's doing it again.
[01:30.36]That is... I just like watched it happen.
[01:34.22]Your teammate just killed you.
[01:35.48]I was sitting there watching it.
[01:37.56]It looked like a firework.
[01:42.61]I'm just pulling this thing back.
[01:43.49]How far do you have to pull it back?
[01:47.07]You just hold as far as you need to.
[01:49.47]Actually, I think the boulder appears once you've reached the threshold.
[01:53.16]Oh, okay.
[01:58.72]Sorry about that.
[02:01.04]I thought that was in the game.
[02:03.08]They're coming to repair Nick's internet connection so he can play the game.
[02:06.97]It's a fucking emergency.
[02:08.93]I seriously thought that was an ambulance in this game.
[02:11.23]I was like, why is this in the game?
[02:15.19]I can respect your culture and also tell you to get the fuck away from me if you try to kill me.
[02:19.67]This guy's AFK.
[02:22.27]What did you think was gonna happen?
[02:23.93]You're sitting there AFK, dude.
[02:26.62]Did you see what I did to him?
[02:29.04]You chopped his, like, leg off or something.
[02:30.72]Is this you with the fists right now?
[02:32.58]Yes, I'm punching you with Fist of Fury, Ninja Bunny.
[02:34.95]Oh, yeah?
[02:35.19]Try to hit me.
[02:35.93]Come on.
[02:36.37]Come on, fight me with your fists.
[02:37.39]Come on, be a man.
[02:38.17]How do I do it?
[02:38.81]How do I throw my thing down?
[02:39.75]Fist off.
[02:39.99]Fist me.
[02:40.55]Fist me.
[02:40.81]I don't think I can do that.
[02:41.83]Fight me.
[02:44.17]All right.
[02:44.90]You guys are hitting each other.
[02:46.66]Come on.
[02:48.56]I'm gonna make you guys kill each other.
[02:49.96]So wait.
[02:50.64]So what do we do with the banner?
[02:51.62]Oh shit?
[02:51.98]I can't even make this on a gamepad I Can't are you telling me I can't make this on a gamepad and I can't change any settings.
[02:59.95]I
[03:14.67]What is this song?
[03:16.35]I've heard this song before.
[03:23.14]That's supposed to be an... That's an old man.
[03:29.96]Who squeezed this guy's nuts?
[03:32.92]Alright, that guy seriously just sounded like somebody was pinching his testicles between two pieces of bread.
[03:40.35]I don't even think I'm gonna make a video on this.
[03:44.16]This is just so- this is just not even fun.
[03:46.31]It's not even funny, it just sucks.
[03:47.85]I really need a weapon.
[03:53.23]Oh!
[03:53.49]I magically have a weapon all of a sudden!
[03:59.00]Just poke them!
[03:59.84]Poke them to death with your tiny little swords!
[04:02.84]It's like I told this guy's girlfriend that she was fat or something and he's like freaking out of the bar punching me.
[04:11.47]You had like far too many Guinnesses, bro.
[04:13.29]You're not gonna hit me for shit.
[04:14.45]Oh, damn.
[04:18.83]Everything's going to shit.
[04:20.78]No, we don't.
[04:23.02]Well then maybe you need some better teammates.
[04:24.90]Of course I do!
[04:25.66]That's what I've been fucking complaining about this entire time!
[04:28.00]Nobody's doing anything!
[04:28.50]Well then you're gonna have to trade your friends for better teammates.
[04:33.92]I can't.
[04:34.30]This guy's just taken.
[04:35.15]Here we go.
[04:37.61]I am leaving.
[04:39.47]You got the grana?
[04:39.91]Go to our spawn with it.
[04:43.87]Holy shit.
[04:46.01]I thought there was auto-balance.
[04:50.28]This game is broken.
[04:53.14]And Mr. Garrison got the first blood, too.
[04:54.92]Damn it, Mr. Garrison!
[04:56.57]I just got switched, too.
[04:57.73]This is great.
[04:58.31]Oh, I think it's auto-balancing people.
[05:00.95]Mr. Garrison's the giant.
[05:02.05]See the red team?
[05:04.14]All one of them?
[05:04.82]All three, four.
[05:07.32]There, Mr. Garrison lies.
[05:08.62]Oh, man.
[05:10.99]He's actually killing people.
[05:12.27]What is this guy doing?
[05:14.09]What the hell is this guy doing?
[05:15.15]Get out of here, man.
[05:15.89]What are you, friendly fire, killing people?
[05:18.55]Kill Mr. Garrison's living.
[05:20.15]What the fuck?
[05:23.68]That guy was just attacking me.
[05:26.10]He was swinging at me like I was an enemy, and I shot him in the throat.
[05:30.86]All sham, no wow was my nemesis and my easy target.
[05:33.78]How?
[05:35.36]How does that make any sense?
[05:37.28]That was easy.
[05:39.10]Oh, this guy was destroying you the entire time, but he's fucking easy to kill.
[05:44.03]No.
[05:44.29]No, you get 10.
[05:44.83]Oh, okay.
[05:45.55]Where'd that come from?
[05:48.07]It's really not a lot of arrows, right?
[05:49.63]Oh, hey.
[05:50.39]No, not really.
[05:51.47]Stop it.
[05:54.19]Hey, hey, dude.
[05:55.17]Hey, look, you're down there.
[05:56.15]This arrow is just in his ear.
[05:59.18]Pretty sure that would probably kill someone.
[06:01.40]How many times do you have to shoot somebody in the fucking face before they die?
[06:04.57]This guy's got two arrows in his face!
