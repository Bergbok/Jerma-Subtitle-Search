[00:08.02]Flex it so you get it right nice and tight.
[00:12.21]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:13.21]Jermuck here with a vlog.
[00:16.43]It's been a while since I've done one of these face-to-face one-on-one.
[00:19.20]Me and you are the only people in this conversation.
[00:22.12]So see your way out of it, buddy.
[00:25.40]There's nobody else here.
[00:26.28]Anyways, guys, hi, welcome to the vlog.
[00:27.76]I haven't done one of these in a while.
[00:29.23]But I thought I would do one tonight because...
[00:33.13]Pretty important reason.
[00:34.79]I'm an uncle.
[00:35.49]You probably saw the title.
[00:36.91]The baby was born.
[00:37.97]Not tonight.
[00:38.99]It didn't, like, just happen.
[00:40.02]Like, oh, did it just happen?
[00:41.64]Okay, I'll get off the phone.
[00:43.32]Hey, it's a video.
[00:44.10]I just spilled that everywhere.
[00:45.18]But no, that's not what this is.
[00:47.32]This is... Hold on.
[00:48.84]I have to clean that up.
[00:49.94]But no, my niece was born exactly two days ago.
[00:54.70]It was at 11 a.m.
[00:56.98]on... Let me look at the calendar.
[00:58.09]On Wednesday, July 31st.
[01:02.01]Got a bunch of pictures.
[01:03.26]There's probably going to be one like right here.
[01:07.36]in this area.
[01:08.42]Right here, my hands are probably disappearing behind.
[01:10.48]Look at the little baby.
[01:11.96]Hello.
[01:12.78]Yes, baby.
[01:14.08]So what's the baby's name?
[01:15.82]I talked to my sister to make sure this was all okay, so I'm not just like uploading pictures of her newborn infant baby on the internet.
[01:23.27]But no, the baby's name is Harper.
[01:25.41]It is a girl.
[01:26.19]Harper Eve is the baby's name.
[01:28.47]Very pretty name for a little wonderful baby right there.
[01:31.59]But Harper Eve is the name of the baby.
[01:34.15]I'm not going to
[01:35.15]tell you the last name because I don't want you to go, like, find her or something.
[01:39.04]And she was already scared enough for me to do this video.
[01:41.16]She's like, make sure, like, nobody, like, harasses me.
[01:44.00]I'm like, no one's gonna... Listen, no one's gonna harass you.
[01:46.56]You're gonna be fine.
[01:47.44]Just chill out.
[01:48.48]You just had a goddamn baby, for Christ's sake.
[01:50.52]Just, like, go sip on some sangria or whatever.
[01:53.62]What do you... What do you do?
[01:55.48]when you're not pregnant.
[01:57.16]If you're watching this video and you were pregnant at one point in your life, what's like the first thing you did?
[02:01.85]What's like the first thing you did after you were pregnant?
[02:04.16]I'm kind of curious because, I mean, I'm a boy.
[02:06.24]I'm a man.
[02:08.86]And I can't have babies come out of my body.
[02:11.64]So, I'd like to know, and if you're not able to... But as you can tell, I'm in a very crazy mood right now.
[02:17.87]I just got home from a family reunion, where everybody was interested.
[02:22.71]We got to do this, like, iPhone FaceTime thing, where it was like, I had the iPad set up, and she was on the iPhone, and she showed pictures of the baby in real time, and it was crazy.
[02:33.34]It was amazing, and it's a really...
[02:35.86]It's a really cool feeling.
[02:37.26]If those of you that have not been able to be alive to see a sibling or a niece or a nephew born, I feel great right now, man.
[02:47.03]I feel awesome.
[02:48.77]Because knowing that somebody in my family is continuing the human chain just feels good.
[02:57.15]You get to see life.
[02:58.79]You get to see death in this crazy world that we live in.
[03:02.43]And you get to see it all.
[03:03.61]And I'm glad that I was able to share this with you guys.
[03:05.41]I just wanted to do a quick little thing to tell you where I've been the last couple days.
[03:08.71]I've been freaking out with family.
[03:10.67]Just with the family conversing about little babies and how cute they are and how I'm going to do lots of snuggles and lots of nose nuzzles to this little adorable thing that's in my life now.
[03:24.92]But yeah, that's about... We're going to wrap it up here.
[03:26.84]I just want to do a quick... I'll see myself out.
[03:29.72]I'll see myself out.
[03:31.52]Don't get up.
[03:35.20]Has there ever been a full body Jerma shot ever recorded?
[03:39.80]I don't think there has.
[03:41.63]I'm pretty sure this is the first ever full body Jerma shot.
[03:47.01]This is my baby.
[03:49.97]Well, I already have a baby.
[03:51.98]His name is Otto.
[03:53.70]Hello.
[03:54.06]Hi.
[03:56.48]You fucking stink.
[03:58.32]Get out of here.
[03:59.64]You smell like fucking piss and dog food.
[04:02.70]But that wraps it up here, guys.
[04:03.88]Just wanted to throw together this quick little vlog.
[04:06.43]Probably a very chaotic vlog, because I'm very excited, as you can probably tell that by now.
[04:11.21]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[04:13.17]Take care, everybody.
[04:14.81]And the meaning of life, guys.
[04:20.01]you
