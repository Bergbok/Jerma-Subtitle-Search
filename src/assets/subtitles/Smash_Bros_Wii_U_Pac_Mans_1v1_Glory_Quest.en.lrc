[00:05.16]This is a one-on-one.
[00:07.00]I haven't even unlocked, like, any characters.
[00:09.55]Doesn't even matter.
[00:10.79]Does it really matter?
[00:11.59]Do I need to unlock characters when you got fucking Pac-Man on this list?
[00:16.69]Gotta make sure I choose my right control setup.
[00:20.77]Who's first?
[00:22.10]Who's first in the four glory ranked 1v1 Pac-Man versus the entire universe?
[00:31.47]Alright, we get this guy's robin.
[00:33.88]Two stock.
[00:35.12]Let's do it!
[00:38.06]I'll show you guys how it's done.
[00:39.06]I'll show you how to... I'm gonna be one of the most professional athletes you've ever seen in this game.
[00:47.60]See, all I know is that you gotta have the hydrant down.
[00:50.89]When the hydrant's down, you can do extra damage.
[00:53.01]You can launch it at people.
[00:55.29]Or you could just get hit by everything that he's done so far.
[00:58.64]That works too.
[00:59.88]You see that?
[01:00.30]Do you see that Hydrant play?
[01:01.82]You see that Hydrant play?
[01:03.68]See that?
[01:03.96]You see that double?
[01:04.88]Oh my god, you're talking about the best fucking Pac-Man in the world.
[01:13.19]I don't really have a follow-up to that one.
[01:18.03]I gotta, like, concentrate.
[01:19.41]I don't want to lose this.
[01:20.11]This is my first ever ranked match.
[01:22.53]You know what I mean?
[01:23.35]You can't, like, screw this up.
[01:28.72]I want to come down.
[01:30.20]It's alright.
[01:31.34]104%.
[01:31.36]I'm doing good.
[01:31.92]I'm doing fine.
[01:34.24]No, I'm not.
[01:35.10]That was a mistake.
[01:35.98]And now she's going to launch it again at me.
[01:37.26]No, do not dodge!
[01:40.62]Fuck!
[01:44.42]I missed!
[01:45.70]I missed again!
[01:48.37]Alright, sit up.
[01:53.75]Fucking sit up and play the goddamn fucking game.
[02:00.30]That fire move.
[02:03.22]What was that?
[02:03.76]I don't even know these characters yet.
[02:05.06]I don't know what I'm doing.
[02:07.14]There we go.
[02:09.08]Alright, time to shape up.
[02:13.05]Oh, that was close.
[02:16.15]That was a hydrant play.
[02:17.55]This is a hydrant play.
[02:18.47]This is a hydrant play.
[02:21.63]Right here, guys.
[02:25.54]Hey, we're gonna fight Smash Bros.? ?
[02:28.35]Well, how about we play Jerma Gets Publicly Embarrassed?
[02:31.18]That works, too.
[02:35.56]How did you- what is this?
[02:37.36]What is this, like, super smoke that you're doing to me?
[02:40.32]I'm telling you, comeback of the year right here, guys.
[02:41.92]You think it's a joke?
[02:47.89]Oh, come on, what is that move?
[02:49.09]I fell off.
[02:54.66]It's alright, I can recover this.
[02:55.54]Oh, did you see that recover?
[03:01.56]Come here!
[03:03.36]Come here!
[03:06.73]How am I still here?
[03:12.05]No, what the fuck?
[03:16.42]Drop it.
[03:17.64]I know what you're going to try to do.
[03:20.84]Should I?
[03:21.12]I could have capitalized on that, but I didn't.
[03:25.92]Alright, now I gotta launch it.
[03:26.90]Now I gotta launch it.
[03:28.60]Bang.
[03:30.00]It's alright.
[03:31.30]He's a little confused.
[03:32.10]Now I gotta put the fruit.
[03:34.60]Oh, shit!
[03:37.07]That almost backfired.
[03:40.81]What?
[03:41.41]What?
[03:41.91]Why did that not hit him?
[03:44.15]That went right through his body.
[03:47.52]That was a load of dog shit.
[03:51.96]It's alright.
[03:52.58]I can recover from this one.
[03:56.36]Dammit, I threw the jello in the wrong direction.
[03:58.87]I lost.
[04:03.61]Throw the strawberry at him.
[04:06.23]You picked up my strawberry?
[04:08.37]You used my own strawberry on me?
[04:10.34]That's when you turn it on.
[04:12.74]Now I'm angry you picked up my strawberry.
[04:14.60]You know how long those strawberries took to grow on my farm?
[04:18.88]Two months!
[04:19.92]How long does a strawberry take to grow?
[04:21.37]A week?
[04:21.63]I don't know.
[04:23.94]10 days?
[04:24.90]No, that's UPS ground shipping.
[04:26.51]We're not talking about ground shipping.
[04:28.03]We're talking about strawberry growth.
[04:31.45]There we go.
[04:31.79]Now that you did that, you really got me angry with that one.
[04:37.39]Alright, okay.
[04:37.89]I'll just come grab you.
[04:40.86]Nope, I missed.
[04:42.62]Oh, I gotta win this one.
[04:43.36]Come on.
[04:48.92]Don't do it.
[04:52.79]Oh, don't do it!
[04:53.55]Don't do it, you motherfucker!
[04:55.13]I lost again!
[04:59.05]19 ranked games and only two victories.
[05:02.67]I have a 10% win rate.
[05:09.37]Guys, I'm pretty sure that I have better winning percentage with scratch tickets.
[05:16.43]I feel like I've played the lottery and won more games than I have with fucking Smash Brothers.
[05:24.68]Pac-Man versus Bowser, huh?
[05:27.66]Alright.
[05:29.58]I heard you liked balloons!
[05:32.23]Oh, dear.
[05:32.61]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[05:33.63]He has, like, some dash moves and stuff, I think.
[05:37.41]Wait, can't he grab you and, like, drop you off the stage?
[05:42.67]Oh, I almost just died there.
[05:47.27]See if I can get him.
[05:48.35]Got him.
[05:50.57]Whoa!
[05:51.19]Can he do that through the trampoline?
[05:53.48]Shit.
[05:54.18]I think that's the move I'm thinking of that he has.
[05:57.00]Don't even think about it.
[06:00.14]You know, I get too caught up in dropping that Hydra.
[06:03.00]That's like the problem.
[06:03.88]What?
[06:04.02]I'm sitting here talking.
[06:05.90]Rude.
[06:07.04]I was telling a story.
[06:12.42]Ooh!
[06:13.04]Ooh!
[06:16.04]I apologize in advance, but I gotta be quiet for this one.
[06:19.86]So enjoy, enjoy the gameplay.
[06:22.46]Enjoy the gameplay, because that's what's gonna be in the background of this gameplay commentary.
[06:26.48]Hey, what's going on guys?
[06:27.27]Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[06:30.11]This is post, so I'm not playing the game right now.
[06:32.61]That's because, you know, you probably could guess... I suck!
[06:39.54]Actually, I got a new costume.
[06:41.86]You know, it's all about the costume, I think, in my opinion.
[06:45.14]If you don't have a good costume on, I mean, you might as well.
[06:48.15]Why did none of us hit that?
[06:49.27]Oh, that would have been sick if I just hit it with him.
[07:00.57]Come here.
[07:05.10]Jump into it.
[07:06.58]Ooh, you got hit by the balloon!
[07:10.18]Oh, that was a full smash!
[07:12.28]Right, we're good.
[07:12.88]We're good.
[07:15.76]Didn't want to do that, but it's alright.
[07:17.04]It's still kind of worked out.
[07:19.24]Drop the hammer on him.
[07:20.50]Turn around.
[07:21.58]Smash it into him.
[07:23.00]Perfect.
[07:23.36]Follow up with the up in the air.
[07:24.82]Up in the air, trampoline.
[07:26.52]Double.
[07:27.78]Yup.
[07:28.46]That's exactly what I wanted to have happen.
[07:30.21]And then, you're gonna throw the key at him.
[07:32.63]Oh, shit.
[07:33.11]No, you're not.
[07:33.47]You're gonna throw the fucking balloon at him again.
[07:36.33]It's gonna miss.
[07:37.55]It's alright.
[07:37.81]Alright.
[07:40.21]I got a lot... I got an advantage over this one!
[07:44.47]Dammit.
[07:48.93]No.
[07:50.67]He's at 72%.
[07:51.75]I should... I should get this.
[07:52.83]I should be alright.
[07:55.15]Oh, come on!
[08:00.30]That's what it is right there.
[08:01.14]You can't... you can't recover for this one.
[08:07.92]Come on!
[08:11.15]Oh, damn it, I missed again!
[08:12.31]Oh my god, I'm just grabbing you with my radar!
[08:21.40]No, he grabbed me.
[08:24.38]Did I just bounce off his head?
[08:25.34]I did.
[08:29.36]That's fine, I'll just launch you like that.
[08:34.15]Save it, save it, save it!
[08:38.82]Come on, let me, let me, he's got 128%.
[08:42.44]I should get this.
[08:44.10]There it is, come on.
[08:46.02]I did it.
[08:48.14]Yes!
[08:50.18]This is too stressful.
[08:52.72]Is there anything in this game that's, like, not as stressful as 1v1 full glory mode?
[09:01.73]Yeah, this is what I'm talking about!
[09:04.13]Eight player smash!
[09:06.27]Nobody knows what's really going on with their character.
[09:09.81]It's just a mess!
[09:11.71]It doesn't matter who wins or loses in A Player Smash!
[09:15.05]Charizard just goes in front of the screen!
[09:17.85]No, but it doesn't matter!
[09:18.67]I don't even know where I am.
[09:20.49]I'm up here on the right.
[09:24.01]Jigglypuff, you're dead.
[09:26.76]Eat this.
[09:28.56]If I aimed in the right direction, that would be great.
[09:30.68]There's no competitiveness here.
[09:35.14]It's just Diddy Kong and Mario.
[09:38.40]Flame Mario, by the way.
[09:42.12]Am I going to win?
[09:42.70]I have a chance here, guys, to win.
[09:45.62]Against a bunch of brainless computer players.
[09:48.89]Okay, it's just down to me.
[09:55.97]No.
[09:57.67]It's just down to me and Dark Pit.
[10:00.37]We both have pretty high health.
[10:01.69]What's going on?
[10:02.33]Why am I doing that?
[10:05.76]I will beat you!
[10:12.18]Yeah, get spiked!
[10:13.76]Yeah, get double!
[10:15.13]I won!
[10:17.09]I think that qualifies, if anyone that's watching could qualify.
[10:22.87]Pac-Man 8 player smash victory against all CPU players that you've made the easiest difficulty?
[10:30.17]It's gotta count for something!
[10:31.69]It's gotta count for something!
[10:33.19]Right?
[10:34.55]I mean, it's got to count for something.
[10:37.27]It's got to count for something, right?
[10:40.96]I mean, it's got to... Thing, right?
[10:44.90]I mean... Thing, right?
[10:49.86]Okay, bye, guys.
