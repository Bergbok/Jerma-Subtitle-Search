[00:00.23]I get a very big Game of Thrones vibe from this song in the shrine.
[00:05.76]Can you just picture like Eddard Stark discussing something with his son?
[00:13.80]You're not gonna do it.
[00:15.84]What a terrible Eddard Stark.
[00:17.39]That was so bad.
[00:21.87]I am so embarrassed right now.
[00:23.51]That was fucking terrible.
[00:25.19]They film Game of Thrones in your town, Mackerel?
[00:29.72]That's kind of amazing.
[00:34.47]Do you like bump into actors?
[00:37.77]Do you go to the coffee shop just so you can accidentally, in quotes, bump into one of the actors?
[00:43.91]You know that, like, Peter Dinklage is going to be at the Starbucks.
[00:46.47]You know, they always go there.
[00:47.33]So you go there with your laptop.
[00:48.27]You hang out for a little bit.
[00:49.39]You see the limo pull up.
[00:50.39]You see Peter Dinklage get out.
[00:51.81]You get up.
[00:52.23]You're going to get in line.
[00:52.79]You're going to get a coffee, maybe.
[00:53.77]I feel like another coffee.
[00:54.92]You get in line.
[00:55.46]He comes up behind you.
[00:56.68]You get your coffee.
[00:57.76]You turn around.
[00:58.24]Give him a little bump.
[00:58.86]Oh, sorry.
[00:59.16]I didn't see you there.
[01:00.02]Peter Dinklage.
[01:01.06]And he's like, yeah, I'm Peter Dinklage.
[01:02.64]And you're like, wow, that's cool.
[01:04.02]Peter Dinklage.
[01:04.80]Game of Thrones, right?
[01:05.60]Yes, that's right.
[01:06.20]Game of Thrones.
[01:06.70]Ah, cool, man.
[01:07.56]What are you doing later?
[01:08.44]Yeah, that's what I'd do.
[01:12.44]He'd be like, oh, nothing.
[01:13.94]Thanks for asking.
[01:14.50]Would you like to come over?
[01:15.36]Yeah, dude, I'm fucking, I don't know, I'm getting kind of busy, but, uh, I don't see if I can schedule it in something like that, you know what I mean?
[01:22.40]All right.
[01:22.96]Hold on.
[01:24.26]Jerma?
[01:25.30]Jerma985?
[01:25.94]Whoa, whoa, uh, I've seen your work.
[01:31.24]And I'd be like, oh, wow, dude, oh, yeah, cool, dude.
[01:34.04]And then he would look at me dead in the eyes and be like, I'm actually a big fan of fucking morons acting like idiots and sucking at everything.
[01:41.75]And then I would be like... What?
[01:48.27]I don't know what... And my face would start to... You know when your face starts to get a little red?
[01:53.21]You can tell.
[01:53.93]Your face is like slowly... You can feel the blood kind of going into your face.
[01:57.47]It'd be... And I'd fuck it in my brain.
[02:00.99]He knows.
[02:01.61]He knows that I'm turning red.
[02:03.31]And then it'd get even more red.
[02:05.40]And then you kind of do something to make it look like that it was supposed to be red in the first place.
[02:10.29]Like, it's like hot in here.
[02:12.19]Starbucks keep their temperature at like 80 or something.
[02:14.73]Jesus, it's fucking hot.
[02:15.29]I don't know what you're talking about though, Peter.
[02:16.73]That's like funny that you say that.
[02:23.77]And he spits directly into my face.
[02:28.11]All these guys, all these FromSoftware guys, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:31.61]I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[02:33.41]If these guys all like fucking burn each other with cigars.
[02:36.33]Like in fucking their spare time.
[02:39.69]They probably develop these games and then they have a cigar burn your skin party.
