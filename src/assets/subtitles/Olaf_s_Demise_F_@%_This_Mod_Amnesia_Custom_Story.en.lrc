[00:10.14]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:11.74]Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[00:15.86]Drinking coffee right now.
[00:17.36]Actually, that's half-calf coffee because I'm really, really freaking tired.
[00:21.25]Overtired, you could say.
[00:23.49]So why don't we play some scary games?
[00:24.61]We're going to be playing Olaf's Demise tonight, which is another amnesia custom story.
[00:31.49]And let's get started.
[00:32.77]Here we go.
[00:33.15]Wee!
[00:34.60]Okay, so... Apparently this house may or may not be haunted.
[00:41.62]I highly doubt that it's not haunted.
[00:44.12]So we're going to do some investigating.
[00:46.83]Pot, throw it on the ground.
[00:48.11]We've got some bottles, throw that on the ground too.
[00:51.05]I don't need... What the hell is that?
[00:52.85]Oh, it's a candle.
[01:00.96]You know, I'm just going to go right out the front door.
[01:04.33]Hey!
[01:05.75]Hello!
[01:06.91]Staircase!
[01:09.23]Hopefully it's not like SCP.
[01:11.77]The never-ending staircase of hell.
[01:17.22]This door opens?
[01:18.62]Does it?
[01:19.84]Open!
[01:21.44]You do not open.
[01:24.70]Come on!
[01:26.42]Son of a bitch.
[01:28.34]Run down the stairs!
[01:30.10]Sprint!
[01:33.52]Was there... Oh.
[01:35.08]Is there a key for that door?
[01:36.17]I don't... I'm so edgy right now.
[01:40.43]No, none of these things.
[01:41.31]I don't have the lamp yet.
[01:43.63]That's one thing.
[01:44.23]I gotta find the lantern.
[01:46.67]What the... So was there actually no paper there?
[01:51.84]There was no paper there, huh?
[01:54.42]You piece of... Mmm... Oh, there's the key.
[02:00.18]Ah!
[02:00.24]Ah!
[02:05.64]Is that guy still chasing me right now?
[02:08.04]No, he's not.
[02:08.56]Oh, my.
[02:09.08]This, this, this, this, this mod.
[02:11.42]This mod sucks.
[02:12.41]This is horrible.
[02:14.29]Already right off the bat, in, like, less than two minutes, there's already two horrible things.
[02:23.99]Let's go open.
[02:26.17]Wait, I can't open this door with this key?
[02:30.66]I still can't get out this fucking door.
[02:35.34]I gotta go back into this room down here.
[02:37.08]Is that what you're telling me?
[02:40.06]Ah, here's the chest.
[02:41.88]With the lantern.
[02:43.68]And the tinderbox.
[02:46.31]Okay.
[02:47.63]Bugs on the ground.
[02:48.63]Squash them.
[02:49.09]Alright.
[02:52.07]So now, is it gonna let me leave?
[02:53.59]Let's hope so.
[02:57.47]Get me out of here.
[02:59.17]Got the lamp.
[03:01.63]I still can't get out of this friggin' room?
[03:07.33]Apparently not.
[03:08.51]Key, where are you?
[03:09.68]Maybe you just wouldn't let me, like, leave, because... Damn.
[03:17.12]What the hell do I have to do?
[03:23.36]Just... There's, like, sacks of potatoes in here.
[03:25.72]I already saw these.
[03:31.67]Oh, there's a door over here.
[03:32.67]How did I miss this door?
[03:33.91]I'm an idiot.
[03:41.28]I think there's a cat in my room, and it's freaking me out because I think I don't know what the noises are.
[03:46.96]This mod has already proven that it's gonna scream at me.
[03:54.38]What is that?
[03:57.26]Ooh, gross.
[04:00.33]Oh, what's that down there?
[04:01.97]Sanity Potion.
[04:02.73]Hooray.
[04:03.33]Nothing else I can do in here.
[04:09.07]Is there another door on the other side?
[04:10.27]Get out of the way.
[04:12.37]Get out of the way.
[04:13.29]Get out of the way.
[04:16.61]No, that's a pig.
[04:18.55]That's a little piggy.
[04:21.40]Maybe it's behind here.
[04:25.38]Maybe it is.
[04:27.48]Ooh, I found a hidden door.
[04:30.32]Get out of here.
[04:33.69]God, how many boxes can one house own?
[04:36.63]There's like a thousand boxes in here.
[04:39.55]Get out of the way, man.
[04:40.57]Alright, give me that key.
[04:43.03]Boink.
[04:43.79]Let's go.
[04:45.21]Coffee before I spit it out.
[04:48.76]What?
[04:49.16]I hate to say this.
[04:49.80]Be prepared when you enter.
[04:50.84]Really?
[04:51.16]What does that mean?
[04:53.92]My key.
[04:54.74]What do I have to do?
[04:55.56]Be prepared?
[04:57.92]Maybe there's another key down here.
[04:59.50]Why would it tell me to be prepared right now when there's nothing here?
[05:02.10]Don't... Tinder.
[05:05.13]I should not have done that.
[05:06.17]That was probably a really dumb idea.
[05:11.23]Don't let the... Can I open this door?
[05:21.40]What the hell is that?
[05:22.02]Oh, it's just a bunch of knights.
[05:26.07]Yeah, good.
[05:26.89]I wonder what's going to happen in this room.
[05:30.13]Give me that.
[05:32.64]Hi, fellas.
[05:34.02]Yeah, it's good to see you.
[05:35.16]Good to see that you're not going to, like, jump in my face in one second.
[05:41.44]What was that?
[05:41.90]Oh, it's one of these things in here.
[05:45.74]Poor guy.
[05:46.22]He got his, like, old body flipped open.
[05:49.64]What?
[05:50.48]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[05:53.13]Why did I just spin around?
[05:54.09]Why did I just spin around?
[05:59.06]Why did it just spin me around?
[06:01.18]Hi.
[06:01.58]Hi.
[06:02.00]Hello, sir.
[06:03.00]Hello.
[06:06.34]Get me out of here.
[06:09.00]Don't.
[06:09.98]Wait, there's like a hidden thing back here.
[06:12.72]Get out of my way.
[06:17.01]Alright, take a second here.
[06:21.09]Take a second here.
[06:24.33]This room is red.
[06:26.71]Interesting.
[06:27.61]There's, uh... I'm running out of oil.
[06:31.13]No, I'm not.
[06:32.27]Boink!
[06:34.81]Oil box.
[06:35.93]Lost key.
[06:36.81]Okay, I got the key.
[06:39.60]What the hell's in here?
[06:42.82]What is that?
[06:44.54]Is this, like, a piece of, like, meat?
[06:46.80]What is, like, Meatwad doing in here?
[06:48.34]Where are the Aqua Teens?
[06:50.26]Where's, like, Master Shake?
[06:52.10]And, uh... Frylock.
[06:53.48]Frylock.
[06:58.00]Hello.
[06:59.14]Move.
[07:01.28]Move.
[07:02.90]I want to, like, drink that sanity potion right now.
[07:04.86]At least I got the keys.
[07:07.86]Get me the frig out of here.
[07:10.46]Which one of these keys is gonna work?
[07:13.38]This one?
[07:14.28]Yes, it will.
[07:16.90]Open the door!
[07:18.80]What?
[07:20.21]Are you serious?
[07:23.43]Wow.
[07:24.05]So I can't even...
[07:26.60]I thought something was going to be right here.
[07:28.48]Definitely it will.
[07:37.06]Maybe.
[07:37.54]I don't know.
[07:42.75]Weird.
[07:43.29]Well, I got that key.
[07:47.41]Was there another door back up top?
[07:50.94]I don't think so.
[07:51.56]I think these are just the only two rooms.
[07:56.80]Unless... Oh, no, no, no.
[08:01.06]Right here.
[08:01.38]Right here.
[08:01.94]One of these.
[08:03.42]Yeah, it's this one right here.
[08:06.02]Let's go.
[08:08.64]Move.
[08:09.98]Please.
[08:14.45]You're supposed to hide from the monsters because that's what people said in the comments.
[08:24.29]You're supposed to hide from the monsters and not use your lamp.
[08:30.24]Is he even in here anymore?
[08:32.30]My lamp is turned off.
[08:36.88]The lamp is off.
[08:37.93]I don't know if there's anybody even in here anymore.
[08:43.89]Please have there nobody be in here.
[08:47.27]Please?
[08:48.93]Thank you.
[08:53.52]So now where do I go?
[08:56.81]Alright, I figured it out.
[08:58.31]I had to use the lost key on this door.
[09:03.46]And now I'm completely out of lamp oil.
[09:06.28]So this is great.
[09:07.08]Where the hell am I?
[09:11.46]What is going on?
[09:14.80]What the hell is going on?
[09:18.94]Oh, this is the room I was in before with the boxes.
[09:21.31]Why are they back up?
[09:24.79]Hold on, why are these boxes back?
[09:26.53]I came in this way.
[09:29.75]Move out of my way.
[09:31.49]Can I jump?
[09:33.01]Can I go on top of this?
[09:34.99]Kind of.
[09:35.35]I wish I could see.
[09:37.52]Oh, I really wish I could see what the hell was going on right now.
[09:43.96]Ugh.
[09:44.12]Ugh.
[09:45.86]Alright, I made it like that way.
[09:48.56]Move.
[09:49.58]Move!
[09:50.76]Move!
[09:54.13]I feel like this is some kind of, like, weird bug that I've encountered.
[09:58.52]Because why the hell are these here?
[10:02.04]Did I make it out?
[10:03.84]I did.
[10:04.66]Alright.
[10:05.14]Happy days.
[10:05.82]I made it out.
[10:07.02]No lamp oil, though, so this is fantastic.
[10:11.31]I need to light something.
[10:15.69]Get me out of here.
[10:16.59]Whoa, I'm, like, insane.
[10:18.81]Sanity potion.
[10:19.55]Sanity potion.
[10:20.93]No, wrong button.
[10:23.46]Sanity Potion.
[10:24.92]Thank you!
[10:26.24]That was delicious.
[10:33.97]Um... Well, I can't do anything else besides go the way that I came up here, so... I don't have any oil.
[10:42.87]I don't know how the hell that ran out that quickly.
[10:47.13]But we can go up here now.
[10:48.21]Can't we, right?
[10:50.85]No, we can't.
[10:55.80]Wait a minute.
[10:58.46]Oh!
[11:00.39]Oh!
[11:00.59]Look at that!
[11:02.41]And she opens.
[11:04.99]And I have no... I wish I could see anything.
[11:08.63]Maybe there's a friggin... Oh, I'm looking for one of those things on the wall.
[11:14.34]One of those tinder boxes on the wall.
[11:17.40]I don't like this hallway, by the way.
[11:19.38]And I'm going insane.
[11:20.14]I gotta keep moving.
[11:20.76]I'm going insane.
[11:22.22]What the... Oh my god!
[11:23.69]What?
[11:36.27]Should I use the key again?
[11:40.10]I'm going insane right now, guys.
[11:43.46]Thank the Lord.
[11:45.30]Jeez.
[11:48.30]And I need a sanity potion.
[11:49.82]You know what?
[11:50.10]I'm drinking the sanity potion first.
[11:52.16]Then, okay.
[11:54.38]Here we go.
[11:55.92]I'm like completely, completely shooken up by that right there.
[12:01.61]You just put me in a coke can.
[12:04.07]And you shook the can until I just exploded out.
[12:11.01]This is- this- I'm not touching the letter.
[12:14.95]Last time I touched the letter, a person jumped out.
[12:22.29]Get me out of this friggin' house!
[12:26.37]Get me out of this house!
[12:28.94]I don't like this place.
[12:30.46]Touch the letter.
[12:33.02]Olaf, if you read this, I think something's in our house.
[12:35.68]I mean, look at the dining plates.
[12:37.13]I'm so scared.
[12:39.17]Pretty much a grammar mistake right there.
[12:41.29]I left something in this room that might help.
[12:46.17]Did you?
[12:46.53]I love how I said that I had plenty of oil.
[12:51.51]Because now it's gone just like that.
[12:55.31]Damn it!
[12:55.71]I'm just going to start smashing into things and see what happens.
[13:05.66]Can I just break the door down?
[13:08.54]Going insane!
[13:09.70]Is it behind the eagle?
[13:17.73]Golden eagle?
[13:22.32]Damn it.
[13:23.76]I left it in this room.
[13:24.80]Yeah, nice vague directions, you fucking asshole.
[13:30.52]Why don't you just tell me what it was?
[13:33.84]Oh, hey, by the way, like, Bill, I left you, like, the secret to getting out of the house.
[13:38.50]It's, like, somewhere in this room.
[13:40.22]I'm not gonna tell you where the fuck it is, though.
[13:48.13]Oh, of course it's behind the painting.
[13:54.97]God damn it.
[13:58.87]I don't have any oil, either.
[13:59.99]Shit, man.
[14:03.84]Man, I got no oil.
[14:09.91]And I have to open this door with no oil.
[14:15.17]Sure, I'll pry it open.
[14:16.43]There's a person standing right there.
[14:23.89]No, it's a knight.
[14:38.05]At ease, soldier.
[14:38.93]I don't want to even look.
[14:42.55]I can't look.
[14:42.93]I don't even know where the hell I am.
[14:46.85]I don't know where the hell I am.
[14:49.24]It's completely dark.
[14:54.24]No, it's not this way.
[14:56.44]I'm going completely insane.
[14:57.76]My character's freaking out.
[15:04.63]Mushrooms.
[15:05.77]Mmm.
[15:08.51]Oh god, that's horrible.
[15:12.92]I don't know if I can play this anymore.
[15:14.30]I don't know if I can do this anymore.
[15:15.28]I don't think I can play this anymore.
[15:17.90]I don't think I can play this mod anymore.
[15:20.08]I think it's over.
[15:30.61]I'm really- I'm gonna- I'm rage quitting the game.
[15:34.89]Just run!
[15:35.71]Just sprint through!
[15:40.01]I don't know what that is.
[15:40.69]I don't know what that is.
[15:41.45]I don't know what that is.
[15:44.05]I don't know what that is, but it's a... Is it behind me or is it in front of me?
[15:49.43]Is it behind me or is it in front of me?
[15:58.30]I can't see anything.
[15:59.82]I just know that he's there.
[16:06.48]Where do I go?
[16:06.92]Should I just hide in this corner?
[16:19.04]What if I... I'm probably going to die right now.
[16:24.98]And this is where I rage quit the game.
[16:28.05]GG.
[16:28.89]I can't see anything.
[16:36.09]If he's still here, then I'm in a lot of trouble.
[16:44.50]Should I go in the door?
[16:46.49]Okay.
[16:47.51]I can see some form of light.
[16:52.68]Can I... Come on, there's gotta be something over here I can, like, get into.
[16:55.72]I wish I could see anything right now.
[16:58.24]My character's probably cra... What's that?
[17:00.52]Oh, it's a... P. God, I can't see... Oh, good, I found, like, another door.
[17:12.94]Door's locked.
[17:13.84]And I need a goddamn key.
[17:18.28]Was there a door over here or something I could get into?
[17:20.06]God, I just can't see anything.
[17:23.43]Here we go.
[17:24.99]Is that the same dude in here?
[17:34.25]Shut up!
[17:35.65]God damn it!
[17:38.26]See ya!
[17:38.80]See ya later!
[17:39.58]My pants just fell down!
[17:41.16]My pants just fell down!
[17:47.06]Dude!
[17:50.34]This mod... I'm alive.
