[00:10.81]Eventually.
[00:11.43]Eventually this is gonna hit someone.
[00:27.00]Skill!
[00:29.08]We have it!
[00:29.84]Needs to be a lot higher.
[00:35.87]I can actually see him coming across the point from here.
[00:38.03]Okay, even higher than that.
[00:40.75]That's getting really close.
[00:41.63]Shoot it again.
[00:48.70]Lower.
[00:49.24]Lower and a little bit to the left.
[00:55.10]More left.
[01:00.10]That's perfect.
[01:00.68]That's perfect right there.
[01:02.38]You hit him heavy in the head!
[01:03.80]You hit him heavy in the head!
[01:05.39]I'm dead.
[01:12.63]I'm dead.
[01:13.65]How far away was I?
[01:16.18]I don't know.
[01:16.68]I don't know where you are.
[01:17.64]I'm at spawn!
[01:20.62]Hey, what's going on everybody, Jerma here.
[01:22.46]Just wanna showcase this one more time in slow motion and just say, this is like one of my favorite clips ever.
[01:28.56]I laugh every single time, mainly because of this guy's reaction.
[01:33.23]When he gets hit right in the face, there's nobody here, and he just starts unloading his minigun in what seems to be a direction towards the sky, but as you'll plainly see, there's nobody there.
[01:45.17]As Star is cloaking and daggering as the spy, nobody is on that balcony right now.
[01:49.58]And what I can only imagine is, you know when you fall down in public, and it's very embarrassing, and then you look around and see if anybody saw you, and you're like, oh, I didn't do that, nobody saw that.
[02:00.82]That's kind of what that reaction just was.
[02:02.74]He freaked out, and then realized, oh, there's nobody here.
[02:06.08]Okay, I can keep going.
[02:07.38]But we did end up capturing it on film, and it's one of the most priceless reactions ever.
[02:12.69]And I love this clip so much.
[02:14.93]And that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[02:16.15]I just wanted to show this little clip.
[02:17.79]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[02:19.38]And of course, take care, everybody.
