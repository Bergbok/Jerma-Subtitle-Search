[00:08.76]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.57]Jerma here with Hitman Absolution.
[00:13.89]Well, not really Hitman Absolution.
[00:15.43]Hitman Absolution does not come out for another couple weeks, but this is the pre-order mission you get if you pre-order the game.
[00:22.52]So I guess this is a sniper challenge.
[00:24.74]I have to kill this guy right here, and should I just shoot him right now?
[00:30.96]Oh!
[00:32.24]Oh!
[00:33.67]Oh!
[00:35.05]Oh my god!
[00:37.37]Dude, did I just beat the mission immediately?
[00:40.21]Oh my god.
[00:43.49]I'm just going absolutely crazy.
[00:45.09]I haven't even introduced the video.
[00:46.75]I haven't even introduced the video and I killed the guy.
[00:49.29]Why did I do that?
[00:53.89]Oh my word, should I not have done that?
[00:56.29]Let's see if I can even complete this.
[00:58.60]Dude, I blew that guy's brains out.
[01:03.14]Oh, get smashed.
[01:06.54]Oh, these people are freaking out!
[01:08.62]Look, it's like somebody dropped a grenade at the party, everyone's like running around.
[01:12.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, god evacuated, I gotta find the other gods.
[01:14.96]Alright, well, anyways, uh, I'm really excited for Hitman Absolution, if you can tell, and... Oh, damn it.
[01:23.28]Uh... Let's just not shoot into the crowd yet!
[01:32.55]Oh, wait.
[01:35.31]There he is right there.
[01:39.05]Oh, come on!
[01:40.93]Come on, you bastard!
[01:43.81]Oh!
[01:45.09]Oh, he's not getting in that helicopter.
[01:47.02]I will make sure he does not get in that helicopter.
[01:48.96]I will put a bullet in between his eyes.
[01:51.42]Just like this guy right here.
[01:52.70]Slow time down and... No, I missed!
[01:57.48]Oh, that's a times two, baby.
[02:01.50]Wait, wait, wait.
[02:01.96]Where is he?
[02:02.30]Where is he?
[02:04.04]There he is.
[02:04.40]There he is.
[02:04.72]Look at this guy.
[02:05.32]He's like, Please don't kill me!
[02:08.40]Please don't kill me!
[02:11.79]Help!
[02:12.79]I'm gonna... No, he's gonna get away!
[02:14.13]He's gonna get away!
[02:15.89]No!
[02:16.43]I gotta do it last-ditch effort!
[02:19.63]Oh!
[02:20.19]No!
[02:20.91]No, he evacuated!
[02:22.23]Fuck!
[02:22.47]Alright, let's try this again.
[02:25.91]Right in his face.
[02:27.73]Bang.
[02:28.87]Right in his face.
[02:31.24]This next guy is going to be second in line to die.
[02:34.06]Get him right in his shoulder blade.
[02:37.49]Oh, somebody saw that.
[02:41.41]I gotta be careful here.
[02:42.33]Let me reload this damn thing.
[02:44.97]Let's go 47.
[02:46.99]Get your game on.
[02:47.79]This guy down here.
[02:50.41]I don't want to hit the window.
[02:51.51]What?
[02:55.25]What?
[02:55.91]What?
[03:00.50]Hey, what happened to the window behind me?
[03:02.32]It just, like, exploded.
[03:03.46]Hey, did I insta-die?
[03:08.14]I think I should be in the clear, though.
[03:09.33]Here we go, clear.
[03:11.51]Now I'm gonna... Wait, I'm gonna take my time here, because every time I kill somebody, like this guy over here, everybody freaks out.
[03:18.25]Is there somebody, like, on the roof?
[03:19.32]Oh, there is.
[03:20.94]Is this a bodyguard?
[03:27.87]What was that guy doing?
[03:28.75]That guy was putting his hands on his waist like, I am a superhero.
[03:32.56]He got killed, man.
[03:34.36]Anybody up, like, top?
[03:36.68]Is there, like, a... What?
[03:40.94]Is that a bodyguard up there?
[03:45.46]Are you serious?
[03:48.86]What?
[03:51.21]How am I supposed to hit this guy?
[03:52.45]Oh!
[03:53.19]Oh!
[03:56.07]What?
[03:57.31]What?
[03:58.35]This guy... That's a long fall.
[04:05.17]That's a long fall.
[04:06.40]He's still going.
[04:07.60]Imagine looking over and seeing that.
[04:12.52]Okay.
[04:14.14]Wow, that took like 15 seconds for that bullet to hit that guy.
[04:19.11]I only got 12 minutes here.
[04:20.29]I gotta be sly.
[04:20.73]Oh my god.
[04:25.40]Anybody else out here?
[04:26.14]Is anyone going to see me shoot this guy?
[04:28.24]I'm going for this guy right now.
[04:30.44]Right in his chest.
[04:31.78]There we go.
[04:32.86]Load, reload.
[04:34.04]Exposed?
[04:34.62]What do you mean, exposed?
[04:41.61]I gotta kill this guy right here.
[04:43.75]I'm going to be such a bad shot, though.
[04:48.55]Oh, bang.
[04:49.34]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[04:54.50]How did I get exposed?
[04:56.64]Who is... Who's placing a phone call?
[05:00.79]Oh, this guy right here is, like, looking for me.
[05:04.05]Get shot in the face, dude.
[05:08.25]What, what, what, Bill, what, what, what, what, is he, where's he making the phone call?
[05:12.71]Hey, you're not gonna find me.
[05:13.91]Where is that guy shooting?
[05:14.77]Hey, bro, I'm over here to your right.
[05:16.96]I'm not, like, over there, like, over this way.
[05:21.50]Oh, there he is!
[05:22.02]Oh, he's about to make the phone call, aka run.
[05:24.16]Oh, he's gonna get smashed.
[05:27.28]Oh, right in the side!
[05:30.00]You're dead, man.
[05:30.96]Oh, hold on, I gotta get this guy.
[05:36.71]Spoink!
[05:38.11]Man, getting headshots.
[05:39.11]You gotta have some skill shots to hit those.
[05:42.07]Oh, there goes the whole party.
[05:44.49]At least I killed the target.
[05:48.51]Right in his back.
[05:49.51]Moving kill streak, nice.
[05:52.40]Let me get them all.
[05:53.64]See ya.
[05:54.28]Right in your glasses.
[05:55.44]Oh!
[05:56.02]That was brutal.
[05:57.32]Oh, guard evacuated.
[05:58.16]What?
[06:00.84]Or is there another guard?
[06:02.66]Down here?
[06:03.06]I only have three more left.
[06:07.03]I don't know where any of them are.
[06:08.33]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[06:10.65]Right in his forehead.
[06:12.35]See ya.
[06:13.79]See ya!
[06:15.43]Any more?
[06:15.79]Any more?
[06:18.90]Cowboy John apparently is still hanging out doing karate moves.
[06:24.67]Oh, boy.
[06:26.65]No, those are bartenders.
[06:29.63]I... There's only one guard left.
[06:30.85]Where the hell is he?
[06:33.64]Oh, I can hold... I can use, like, an instinct?
[06:36.56]I have, like, superpowers?
[06:38.38]Ooh!
[06:40.28]Oh, damn.
[06:41.10]This guy's... Oh, this guy's gonna hit right in his face.
[06:44.16]When he... Right here.
[06:45.80]Ready?
[06:46.16]Here it is.
[06:48.54]Oh, baby!
[06:49.46]Yeah!
[06:50.67]Yeah!
[06:53.48]Hey, I did it.
[06:54.68]Nice.
[06:57.85]Well, I wonder what kind of score I got.
[06:59.35]I didn't do that well.
[07:02.49]Silent Assassin?
[07:03.31]No, I didn't.
[07:04.01]I got... Oh, I unlocked something for Hitman Absolution.
[07:08.12]Increases stability on sniper rifles.
[07:09.92]Oh, that's... That would be a good thing to have.
[07:13.49]But yeah, thanks so much for watching, guys.
[07:15.95]Really do appreciate it.
[07:16.85]I am so excited for Hitman Absolution, which launches in less than two weeks.
[07:21.44]It's going to be so much fun.
[07:22.34]You're going to see a lot of content of that game on this channel.
[07:25.04]So stay tuned for that, guys.
[07:26.66]And again, if you pre-order Hitman, I know this is somewhat old content.
[07:30.54]It came out a while back.
[07:31.84]But if you pre-order Hitman right now, you're going to be able to get this and have some fun with it.
[07:35.70]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[07:36.94]And of course, take care, everybody.
