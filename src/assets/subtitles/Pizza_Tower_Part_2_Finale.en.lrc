[ve:60.16.100]

[00:31.83]Hello.
[00:34.71]I'm here.
[00:36.35]Sorry.
[00:36.97]Had to take a very, very important phone call.
[00:41.47]Hey.
[00:43.46]Pizza in 30 minutes or less or it's free.
[00:46.46]Here I am.
[00:46.86]I already said it in chat and I thought it was funny.
[00:54.04]No, what's up?
[00:59.96]Yeah, 30 minutes or less.
[01:01.36]And that's when I got here.
[01:02.82]Need to encourage the Cowardly Dog.
[01:10.75]Nah.
[01:11.61]What's up?
[01:12.43]How you doing?
[01:27.54]Gonna be hanging out, chilling out again tonight.
[01:30.02]Playing some more Pizza Tower.
[01:32.91]I'm very well rested.
[01:34.99]Got a nice... Got a nice tea here.
[01:38.67]I had dinner already.
[01:41.18]So I'm good to go.
[01:47.94]After this, I don't think this is going to take that much.
[01:52.55]I mean, it probably is.
[01:53.27]What would you say?
[01:54.91]I'm probably half way through the game.
[01:56.55]Maybe 50-60% of through the game.
[01:59.81]Probably another 3-4 hours, maybe.
[02:01.06]We'll see.
[02:01.78]I don't know.
[02:03.84]But after this, the idea is whether it's today or at some point next week, because after this stream, you are not going to see me for probably about five days or so.
[02:17.41]Four or five days at least.
[02:20.27]Big, big Grotto Beast stuff coming.
[02:22.87]News.
[02:27.11]That's the intention.
[02:33.72]And I am a day early.
[02:35.76]And I'm going to tell you what's going to happen to the sus, because the sus at this point is kind of a weird spot.
[02:42.84]So the sus, which is when you come to the stream and you're in the chat, you type in, hey, exclamation point sus.
[02:47.14]It tells you when the next stream is going to be.
[02:50.25]It has never been accurate.
[02:52.87]And in previous years, I have always come into the chat and said, hey, guys, I'm going to stream.
[03:00.51]I'm not streaming tomorrow.
[03:01.37]I'm going to stream two days from now.
[03:04.09]There was always a window of the, it was scheduled, and I would always delay it by a day.
[03:10.64]It would happen 50% of the time, I'd say 40% of the time at least.
[03:15.88]This year, we have a different problem.
[03:19.60]This year, instead of delaying the stream, I pull it forward a day.
[03:24.39]It happens almost every time.
[03:26.19]So I do all these reverse delays now.
[03:28.23]That's the problem this year.
[03:30.92]Well, problems, I mean, yeah, it's not a problem, but you know.
[03:36.34]So what's probably going to happen to the sus is the sus is going to tell you when a stream is absolutely not going to happen.
[03:45.82]So for instance...
[03:47.94]If you do the sus today, after tonight, tomorrow, it's going to say, hey, you cast sus.
[03:54.12]He ain't going to be here for fucking four days.
[03:56.46]And it is when I know I won't be here for at least a few days.
[03:59.60]Or when I know I will not be streaming.
[04:03.25]So the sus is now going to be not when the stream will be, but when the stream will not be.
[04:10.33]Isn't that interesting?
[04:11.05]I think I like that.
[04:16.16]you cast sus you sense a stream not happening for the next three days the anti-sus yeah we have we're gonna the sus is gonna go through its evil arc very confusing the evil sus is anti-sus
[04:45.38]Or maybe I just... Maybe Sus is just a general... Hey, yeah, I'm actually... I'm planning on streaming a few times this week.
[04:51.17]Just... You'll get notified.
[04:53.45]Maybe that's the plan.
[04:56.89]But I definitely... I'm starting to see the issue of... Instead of delaying every time, now I'm pulling it forward a day every time.
[05:03.68]So, whatever.
[05:05.64]Whatever.
[05:09.03]And I'll be honest, the sus has always kind of been there to keep me honest.
[05:13.99]Because if I know that the sus is telling people there's a stream, like in a day or so, I'm, I'm, it was like, oh yeah, I'm going to be here in the next day or two.
[05:24.54]If there's no schedule, then you might, I might run into a problem where it's like, hey, there's no schedule.
[05:29.26]I'm fucking streaming tomorrow.
[05:31.40]I'm streaming Tuesday and I'm streaming Wednesday.
[05:33.48]You know what?
[05:33.84]Fuck it.
[05:35.24]Why stream again?
[05:39.73]It's been a way to keep myself honest, in a way.
[05:46.05]But we'll see.
[05:46.43]I've been streaming a lot more this year.
[05:48.71]That's not the point.
[05:49.67]The point is not to stream more.
[05:50.77]It's just to stream kind of whenever I feel like it.
[05:52.23]And I feel like it right now.
[05:54.21]So, you cast sus.
[05:55.51]You sense the next stream is whenever this weirdo feels like it.
[05:57.85]How's that sound?
[06:00.16]Is that good?
[06:08.60]Oh, I didn't tweet.
[06:09.48]Uh-oh.
[06:12.80]But after this, after we play Pizza Tower, the plan is to play, uh, Hylix.
[06:18.04]I'm looking forward to that.
[06:23.39]Tweet it.
[06:24.91]I'm gonna.
[06:25.29]There we go.
[06:40.56]Okay, what's a good tweet?
[06:45.82]How about... My throat is so fucked up.
[06:50.00]What's going on?
[06:51.39]Pizza Tower Part 2.
[06:53.95]Yeah, that's what's happening.
[07:13.15]OK, there we go.
[07:16.15]Gonna hit your feed in a second.
[07:17.49]Hey, look at that.
[07:22.14]There it is.
[07:23.34]You need to watch part one to understand part two.
[07:26.20]I can give you a quick rundown.
[07:32.46]I'm just going to run into walls.
[07:34.66]And make frustrated grunts.
[07:38.21]That's kind of what happened yesterday, so it's pretty much going to be the same stream.
[07:41.87]Just different levels.
[07:46.23]Well, actually, you probably should understand part one.
[07:48.87]Let me help you.
[07:50.11]Let me give you a quick recap of part one.
[08:00.30]And that's pretty much it.
[08:02.76]Let's see if we see it in part two.
[08:09.91]Here we go.
[08:13.53]Are you gonna play VR again?
[08:14.41]I don't know.
[08:16.37]I think VR might... I'm gonna have to set up like a seated VR scenario.
[08:23.12]Just because of the... Every time I do VR, it just kind of kills me for fucking four or five days straight.
[08:31.08]It's happened pretty much every single time.
[08:34.94]As much as I would love to do it all the time, because it's so fun and just so interesting and there's always such funny, cool shit to do with it.
[08:42.38]Uh, probably I'd have to figure out to get it in a different spot or something.
[08:48.24]Alright, let me go.
[08:48.88]I did, if you actually do want an actual recap, I did the first three floors.
[08:54.03]There are five floors.
[08:55.05]Uh, and where is the... I guess I didn't 100%.
[09:01.11]But I'm not gonna do that, though.
[09:07.10]Did you go to the beach?
[09:10.32]Um, no.
[09:11.14]I didn't go to the beach.
[09:11.80]What do you mean?
[09:19.41]Can I use the same elevator to go?
[09:20.59]Oh, no, it's a different elevator.
[09:28.72]Where's the other elevators?
[09:36.84]Did I do all?
[09:37.72]No, I didn't complete this, did I?
[09:40.78]I did this one.
[09:44.76]Did I do all the levels down here?
[09:46.83]Oh, that's a C?
[09:48.17]No, we're getting better than that.
[09:51.27]What level is this?
[09:52.69]Yeah, this is the last thing I did.
[09:54.21]I'm getting better at this scene.
[09:55.13]Fuck this.
[10:04.54]Actually, maybe I should warm up first.
[10:05.76]Noooo!
[10:20.77]I gotta get at least a B. Oh!
[10:41.70]I got stuck.
[10:43.86]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:44.64]Restart, restart, restart.
[10:45.44]I got stuck.
[10:46.63]I wanted to jump, and I didn't.
[10:57.62]That was just bad RNG.
[10:58.44]I was just seeing if I could throw them.
[11:05.01]I want to see if I can throw them.
[11:14.52]But I'm testing the game design.
[11:30.84]Oh, yeah, game design handy.
[11:32.14]Game design handy.
[11:50.20]See, that's what's called pivoting in the middle of a decision.
[11:54.01]I want everyone to see that.
[11:54.89]You've seen my immediate problem solving.
[11:57.03]Fuck you.
[11:57.67]I'm sorry.
[11:59.69]I gotta shut up.
[12:00.29]All right, I got him.
[12:07.42]I'm ready.
[12:17.22]For God, this is fake.
[12:23.20]What?
[12:25.63]How big is that explosion?
[12:26.59]Oh, the explosion is huge.
[12:29.85]Alright, I'm just trying to see what the game design is.
[12:31.55]This one's fake.
[12:40.92]I... Come on, man.
[12:57.81]Come on, man.
[12:59.17]I was just testing.
[13:05.18]It was just testing.
[13:09.90]I was going to see how the controls work. ...
[13:32.18]I wanted to restart so bad, but I'm not gonna.
[13:45.79]That was bullshit.
[13:47.78]Turn up the music?
[13:49.60]I will after I playtest for another few minutes.
[13:56.02]I gotta stop running.
[14:00.76]The whole game trains you to hold right trigger the whole game.
[14:03.38]That's... Whatever, I'm sticking to it.
[14:24.26]Oh my god, why did I look at chat?
[14:25.86]Okay, if I restart again, I will stop streaming.
[14:33.04]No restarts.
[15:08.55]I forgot he... Oh!
[15:28.30]I did the same thing!
[15:38.70]parry that it's it's it's hard dude this is one of those cocaine games all right that's what I'm gonna I'm gonna that's what I'm gonna say all right just quiet this is what I I this is what I feel like a cocaine is like is this whole game just like
[16:25.53]Alright, that's gotta be at least a B, right?
[16:47.47]I said this is what I think cocaine is like.
[16:49.59]I've never done cocaine.
[16:54.99]I have no fucking plans to either.
[16:56.29]Hey, I'll take a B.
[17:26.57]I'm way happier with that.
[17:27.61]I'll take a B. B is fine.
[17:32.13]I don't think I did all the other missions here, did I?
[17:34.99]I did mini golf, which I got an A. Excuse me.
[17:39.33]Is this a space level?
[17:53.87]There is a space level.
[17:55.68]There's also... Oh, I didn't do almost everything here.
[17:58.04]Okay.
[18:03.60]You know what else I need to do?
[18:04.44]I need to really slow down in the first part.
[18:09.52]In part one, I still have that mindset where it's like I have to go as fast as I humanly can, right?
[18:15.60]Which is inaccurate.
[18:24.14]Okay, let's do this one.
[18:26.83]Make it a little louder.
[18:30.31]How's that?
[18:30.73]Better?
[18:34.47]Alright, so don't go fast.
[18:37.51]Just chill.
[18:38.31]It's not a big deal.
[18:39.75]Just relax.
[18:50.65]It's all about combos.
[18:57.82]This song's great.
[19:07.64]Uh, and the blocks are up here.
[19:08.60]Okay, up here.
[19:10.38]Oh.
[19:14.47]I don't know.
[19:14.83]This might have best soundtrack 2023.
[19:17.60]I mean, we're only two months into the year, but I don't think I've heard anything since.
[19:26.12]Even well into 2022.
[19:27.50]This is amazing.
[19:30.40]This is really, really great.
[19:39.43]What about this?
[19:43.11]Interesting.
[19:43.71]How'd you get up there?
[19:54.11]There's a bell up there.
[20:03.63]Are the balloons part of the environment or are they just up there?
[20:21.53]Is this hurting me?
[20:22.77]Stop it.
[20:31.04]Stop!
[20:33.96]Stop!
[20:48.94]Who is this insane guy in the top right?
[20:51.82]Come on.
[20:52.08]That's Pepino.
[20:52.90]I want to go down there.
[21:13.50]Hmm.
[21:18.89]How do I get down there?
[21:19.79]To run faster?
[22:00.64]Why did that hurt?
[22:02.56]Very cool
[22:23.19]I got a D, so I want to get up to the right, probably.
[22:31.17]OK.
[22:36.01]What cartoon does this remind you of?
[22:39.87]You know, it's funny you say that because.
[22:44.70]It's this weird, nondescript cartoon.
[22:48.06]It's a style from.
[22:51.34]It's like Rocko's Modern Life.
[22:58.62]It's got this weird late 90s, mid 90s kind of vibe.
[23:04.88]Cow and Chicken.
[23:05.68]Yep, that's another one.
[23:07.10]Early Cartoon Network kind of stuff.
[23:11.07]Courage the Cowardly Dog.
[23:12.09]Yeah, for sure.
[23:20.29]Okay, let's go.
[23:27.88]Ooh.
[23:31.12]Go backwards?
[23:33.36]There you go.
[23:45.55]I got to go up here.
[23:46.65]Can I make it over there?
[23:48.85]I don't know.
[23:51.29]Yeah, I can.
[23:51.83]Whoa.
[24:18.41]Come on, give me that pocket.
[24:24.39]What level is this?
[24:25.35]Um... I don't know.
[24:41.68]Come on.
[24:43.98]Frost Cove.
[24:49.47]Secret.
[24:58.44]What does he say?
[25:15.25]Sometimes he goes like to go.
[25:27.61]Very nice!
[25:31.95]Paranoid is what he's saying.
[25:33.27]He goes, Paranoid!
[25:35.25]Is that what it is?
[25:54.63]He-cha!
[25:56.84]Pizza!
[25:57.76]Pizza!
[25:58.30]Pizza!
[25:58.84]Pizza!
[25:59.72]Pizza!
[26:00.42]Pizza!
[26:00.96]I think I can get in there.
[26:27.22]Had a bad day today.
[26:30.30]Sorry to hear that.
[26:32.94]No, what the?
[26:34.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:35.23]I want to go back down.
[26:36.85]Oh.
[26:39.19]I missed it.
[26:40.29]That's all right.
[26:46.07]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:49.08]No.
[26:49.72]No.
[26:49.96]It's moving too fast.
[26:51.72]No.
[26:52.14]I wanted to get that stuff.
[27:04.02]I can't grab these.
[27:04.80]This level is cool.
[27:33.91]Nice.
[27:35.25]Oh, I have to do it a bunch of times.
[28:06.60]That's a big combo going.
[28:19.68]No, shit!
[28:21.62]Whatever.
[28:41.75]Oh my God.
[28:43.27]How are you?
[28:44.57]Jeez.
[29:20.86]There's probably a secret up there.
[29:22.24]Alright, I'm good.
[29:55.34]No, good.
[29:56.52]Nice.
[30:05.51]Very cool.
[30:06.87]That was a fun level.
[30:12.14]That might be one of my favorites, actually.
[30:26.99]That was probably my favorite one.
[30:33.09]I like it when you bust a move like this.
[30:35.19]I like how you can move with this.
[30:40.15]Do you eventually get to do something with this or is it just a fun little thing to do?
[30:50.01]Just for fun.
[30:50.75]That's cool.
[31:01.08]All right, so there's one more level, which is up, maybe.
[31:08.50]All this whole time, I didn't even ask.
[31:10.97]How the fuck you're doing?
[31:11.89]Remember to not take too many breaks.
[31:21.30]Keep playing.
[31:21.90]Your time here is limited.
[31:23.00]Damn.
[31:29.52]Don't take too many breaks.
[31:30.82]Capino Pizza 3000.
[31:32.88]What is going on over here?
[31:34.29]Change direction and jump.
[31:35.39]Oh, well, we're going that way.
[32:02.66]Level lap two.
[32:07.36]The moon's smoking.
[32:12.98]Yeah, whatever.
[32:25.33]Wait, can I move up or something?
[32:30.03]Oh, I can do that.
[32:38.94]Sega Genesis?
[32:40.78]Yeah, that's another one too.
[32:41.68]It definitely feels like an old Genesis game.
[32:47.52]Old Super Nintendo game.
[33:00.55]You mean Sonic?
[33:02.78]Yeah, it doesn't look like Sonic, though.
[33:05.32]There's some other games, like Boogerman, somebody said.
[33:07.94]This is, this looks and feels like Boogerman.
[33:11.74]Pop that.
[33:12.28]I am not going to miss, you know what I'm saying?
[33:25.49]Earthworm Jim.
[33:26.65]Yep, exactly.
[33:34.98]There are people still making stuff in that kind of style.
[33:37.88]I can definitely get in there.
[34:06.90]That sound effect is somewhere, too.
[34:09.72]That... Just don't know where.
[34:12.33]It was the other side, wasn't it?
[34:21.55]Or maybe it's up.
[34:23.73]Might be up there.
[34:28.27]No, it's probably the other side.
[34:29.88]Damn it.
[34:42.29]Uh, I actually don't.
[34:43.39]Hold on.
[34:43.69]Can I go down?
[34:44.67]I cannot.
[34:48.30]Okay.
[35:00.33]Not yet.
[35:02.77]Okay, well.
[35:11.91]Wait, oh, wait, I can get it now.
[35:13.53]I can get it.
[35:13.95]That's actually a good thing that happened.
[35:15.43]Oh, God.
[35:35.48]No, no, no, no.
[35:37.20]Just fly.
[35:37.70]Everything's fine.
[35:38.36]We're good.
[35:38.94]Shh.
[36:00.99]Hey, welcome to Jirba985.
[36:02.83]Funny noises!
[36:04.57]Uh, I already went in here, right?
[36:13.85]I did not.
[36:51.18]you can only make 114 funny noises this stream from now on 113. motherfucker
[37:25.43]I'll never be able to hear anything else.
[37:32.63]I didn't even make that one.
[37:33.79]Oh, I kind of did.
[37:35.24]All right.
[37:43.04]Well, I can definitely go up.
[38:00.80]Well, whatever.
[38:01.18]I don't have to get everything.
[38:06.42]I'm just so concerned this one is going to be underneath me.
[38:25.87]Really?
[38:26.07]It has to be the other side then, huh?
[38:42.93]How do I... How do I change directions?
[38:48.17]Oh, you have to be on the floor.
[39:00.87]Okay.
[39:36.12]No.
[39:39.10]That sound right there.
[39:40.75]That... The sound that goes... Pew, pew, pew, pew.
[40:07.19]Where's this person's room?
[40:08.05]Hmm.
[40:16.25]Okay.
[40:20.29]Oh.
[40:21.13]Whatever.
[40:32.56]Damn it.
[40:34.86]Damn it.
[40:54.98]No?
[40:56.26]Okay.
[40:57.80]I'm going so fast.
[41:13.96]Don't.
[41:14.46]I want to get this in one hit.
[41:23.29]Okay, now... Oh my god, I fucking ruined everything.
[41:43.93]Got it.
[41:45.61]Okay.
[41:58.57]Oh wait, but what about so many things to do in each level?
[42:07.78]There's so many cool things to do in each level.
[42:28.17]How loud?
[42:28.87]Do you think the person that screamed that... I'm just curious how loud that really was in studio.
[42:47.79]Wait.
[42:50.77]Down here maybe somehow?
[42:58.03]um
[43:26.62]Oh wait, I keep it.
[43:27.70]I keep it.
[43:30.12]I think I'm done with this game.
[43:32.29]I don't play puzzle games and this is like a puzzle part.
[43:35.33]You know how I feel.
[43:35.97]Anytime I get to a puzzle section, I just quit it because I don't do that.
[43:38.99]I just don't play games like that.
[43:40.69]I just don't like it.
[43:43.41]Fuck.
[43:48.07]Yeah, that's it.
[43:48.57]I don't play games like this.
[43:49.89]Like, any time I'm like, oh, I have to use... I have to, like, put this, like, circle into that, like, circle hole and then take that key up.
[43:57.16]No, like, I'm done.
[44:14.65]Hurry!
[44:15.15]Hurry!
[44:15.57]I'm not going fast!
[44:41.47]I need to get in there!
[44:42.07]I don't even know why but I just had to.
[44:53.91]What?
[45:29.70]Get out of my way!
[45:30.40]Oh my god!
[45:32.06]What?
[45:32.92]Oh shit!
[45:35.30]Oh shit!
[45:42.97]No!
[45:43.33]Stop!
[45:44.19]I'm fucking panicking right now.
[45:45.47]Stop panicking and just play it!
[45:46.73]Come on dude!
[45:47.70]Oh my god!
[45:48.30]I'm panicking!
[45:49.34]Stop!
[45:49.66]Just go!
[45:50.28]Just crawl!
[46:05.44]Fine, look at this.
[46:07.02]Get the sandwich!
[46:09.79]I want to get the sandwich.
[46:46.30]Shit.
[46:47.00]What did I miss?
[46:49.78]Not bad.
[46:50.52]Not bad.
[46:54.38]I believe that's the whole floor.
[46:55.90]Can you put this game into food mode?
[47:03.74]No.
[47:03.96]See, this game is not... I would never qualify this as a game that could be food mode.
[47:10.01]There's too much to pay attention to.
[47:11.13]Food mode is specifically a game where it's pretty slow paced and there's a ton of downtime in between each major thing to do.
[47:23.42]You don't... I'm not running full sprint like this and then it's like, oh, hey, it's time for dinner.
[47:29.62]No, no, I would just quit the level.
[47:31.06]I don't know if I'd be able to restart it again.
[47:43.65]I think I did pretty damn good on this floor.
[47:47.31]I missed two toppings.
[47:49.01]Couldn't do better than that.
[49:00.02]There's over here.
[49:00.74]That looks like super jail.
[49:07.36]It does.
[49:12.43]You've gone far enough, buddy.
[49:15.01]You need to be this tall.
[49:25.20]This image is so fucked up.
[49:28.21]It's so scary.
[49:29.87]But somehow, it's cool.
[49:33.53]Good show, I say.
[49:34.67]I'm gonna move these out of my way.
[49:39.50]I just became... Now.
[49:42.20]You got me now without the armrests.
[49:44.70]That's how you know everything's gonna get fucking crazy now.
[49:54.40]Egg city.
[49:54.98]Whoa.
[50:03.84]Cool.
[50:13.19]Does your fridge smell weird if you check the expiration date?
[50:16.65]I guess I'm just gonna do this one.
[50:23.24]Oh shit.
[50:24.58]What?
[50:24.82]That's the name of this place?
[50:29.23]This actually says, oh shit?
[50:33.81]What?
[50:39.87]Sewer level.
[50:40.47]Okay.
[50:47.57]Oh, that's kind of gross.
[50:54.85]Stick to the wall and then wall jump.
[51:01.12]Okay, um, hold on.
[51:04.84]You're way slower like this too.
[51:15.66]Shit, I want to jump over that.
[51:21.88]go let go get in there I want I how did I get in there last time
[51:52.06]Jump?
[51:52.82]What the fuck?
[51:57.20]I thought... Okay, I thought you had to be... I thought you had to be rolling.
[52:12.57]Really?
[52:14.11]Are these supposed to be the Ninja Turtles?
[52:15.25]That's funny.
[52:31.13]No!
[52:31.49]Different pipe though.
[52:38.31]Can I not go on that one?
[52:45.42]I want to break it.
[53:14.27]They're like the cat jams.
[53:15.67]They're like the rat dancing.
[53:21.70]It's so cool.
[53:22.42]It's so cute.
[53:24.06]It's just so like funny.
[53:44.47]So the orange pipes don't seem to do very much, huh?
[53:49.79]Or am I missing something?
[53:50.55]Of course you're the streamer that likes the dancing rat.
[53:55.86]What team are you on?
[53:57.84]I'm on neither one of these teams.
[53:59.90]I just like seeing them both dance.
[54:02.78]I don't think you can be on either one.
[54:18.72]I think there's something back here.
[54:23.30]There was!
[54:24.06]Come over here.
[54:43.48]Uh, how do I get in there?
[54:51.18]I wanna get in there.
[55:00.03]Jeez.
[55:00.67]Oh.
[55:27.28]I thought that was Peter Griffin for a second.
[55:46.47]Alright, from right here.
[55:48.13]I was like, oh, that's Peter Griffin right there.
[56:13.88]Why would it be Peter Griffin?
[56:15.94]Idiot.
[56:16.12]It's not funny.
[56:18.40]That wasn't Peter Griffin.
[56:20.08]Fucking idiot.
[56:21.78]Stop talking.
[56:22.91]Stop talking.
[56:29.79]Stop fucking talking, Jeremy.
[56:35.35]No!
[56:44.48]I'm just always looking for secrets, you know what I mean?
[56:59.57]Turn the music down?
[57:01.45]Um... I think that would... I think you would be very upset with me if I did.
[57:06.47]Ah, shit.
[57:09.61]Oh my god.
[57:17.26]Hmm.
[57:19.02]Is it more momentum?
[57:25.36]It was more momentum.
[57:32.66]Well, I really screwed that one up.
[57:37.04]Actually, maybe I do want to go that way for a second.
[57:40.95]Shit.
[57:41.59]Come on.
[57:47.79]Alright, I'm bouncing around all over the place.
[57:58.75]Stop.
[57:59.15]I can't stop moving.
[58:00.71]Alright, we'll just go this way.
[58:22.98]Well, I definitely want to go that way.
[58:46.47]Are you counting down how many sounds I'm making?
[58:52.09]Maybe I'm not.
[58:52.69]What happens when we get zero?
[58:55.28]What happens at zero?
[59:16.97]Jeez.
[59:17.67]Ah!
[59:32.61]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:33.49]Dude, come on.
[59:43.10]I just stopped streaming.
[59:46.24]Yeah, sorry guys.
[59:47.64]That's all for today.
[59:48.60]Well, it's definitely over here.
[59:52.32]Come on.
[59:53.58]What just happened?
[60:09.64]Did I not even get the thing I was supposed to get?
[60:12.12]How did I not touch it?
[60:13.78]What?
[60:15.40]I grazed the frame of one little frame above?
[60:19.98]What are you talking about?
[60:21.01]Come on.
[60:23.21]Oh, well.
[60:39.51]I gotta get in rhythm.
[60:40.67]There's no rhythm to this right now.
[60:43.69]Shit, no!
[60:44.77]Oh my god, what's happening?
[60:47.65]No, I have a second chance?
[61:13.02]What just happened?
[61:15.24]Hurry up.
[61:15.68]I'm going.
[61:30.31]Get away from me.
[61:32.67]Get away from me.
[61:53.74]Go this way.
[62:07.94]Just kidding.
[62:11.13]Geez.
[62:11.59]No no no no no no no no no no no.
[62:55.85]oh my goodness you have to hold it first it's like it takes like a second
[63:24.79]Is that anything else to get?
[63:34.23]I think that's it.
[63:36.23]It's an A. A minus?
[63:46.68]That's not what it says.
[63:52.26]Can you eat a whole pizza on stream?
[63:57.92]Very unhealthy.
[63:58.94]That's it.
[63:59.26]It's probably a bad idea.
[64:04.91]Oh, new costume.
[64:07.77]Killing a thousand enemies in a playthrough.
[64:13.43]I don't think I could do it.
[64:16.95]I don't know why you'd want to do it.
[64:18.05]How about the... Too much, like, fat.
[64:23.55]Sauce and shit.
[64:24.35]Like, it's way too much.
[64:26.93]All the calories.
[64:28.07]All the heaviness on your metabolism.
[64:30.42]Blood sugar.
[64:31.10]Like, what if something crazy would happen to it?
[64:33.04]Nah, it's a bad idea.
[64:38.64]Oh, no.
[64:40.04]Snotty's dead.
[64:53.19]Missing, oh no.
[64:56.59]Snow level?
[64:57.47]What's up here?
[65:03.20]Probably 300?
[65:04.48]Only 200, all right.
[65:05.02]Let's do the snow level.
[65:12.77]You ate a whole pizza on the Seaman stream.
[65:16.02]Yeah, but that was a small... That was a personal pizza.
[65:19.83]I didn't eat the whole thing.
[65:20.57]Did I eat the whole pizza?
[65:22.45]I ate it over the course of a couple of hours.
[65:26.51]Yeah, that was a personal pizza.
[65:34.78]You ate it in five minutes?
[65:39.28]I can definitely break that.
[65:42.34]I did not eat it in five.
[65:43.48]You literally ate, cut it into four pieces.
[65:45.46]Yeah.
[65:46.58]But those pieces, yeah, it was a whole pizza.
[65:49.40]But I ate it.
[65:51.18]Also, this is important too.
[65:53.80]That stream was, almost 12, 13 hours long.
[66:00.22]You ate, it was, I was like, that was like an 11 plus hour stream.
[66:07.47]Yeah, that's the only food I ate over the course of like, and then almost a whole day.
[66:16.54]And that's really bad to do that.
[66:18.58]But, you know, I was screaming and I was playing C, man.
[66:21.02]And that's what happened.
[66:22.14]There we go.
[66:35.30]I'm going way too fast to stop.
[66:37.56]I can't slow down.
[66:45.21]I can't go that way with it.
[67:00.81]Shit, I can get it.
[67:01.79]Come on.
[67:09.15]There we go.
[67:18.40]Figured it was gonna be a... uh, secret over there.
[67:24.00]Guess not.
[67:27.58]Hot pepper?
[67:27.98]Ooh, spicy!
[67:35.00]Holy shit.
[67:35.56]Okay, that's what it wants me to do.
[67:47.56]Did you like the Seaman stream?
[67:53.34]I think there was a lot of stuff that happened on that stream.
[67:56.08]Yeah.
[67:59.90]Sometimes you have to just finish something.
[68:02.83]Even if it's like, you know what?
[68:04.03]I don't know about this.
[68:05.99]You have to finish it.
[68:07.97]You know for a fact that I would no chance, no chance, would I have actually finished that game on another day.
[68:15.99]You all know that for a fact.
[68:29.79]There's probably a secret over there that I'm not getting over here.
[68:42.61]Can I avoid all this and just jump?
[68:44.47]I can.
[68:45.37]Kind of.
[68:50.18]Really?
[68:50.46]Oh well.
[68:53.36]Probably on the way back.
[69:31.48]Do you like the pizza tower stream?
[69:33.00]Oh, that pizza tower stream.
[69:34.88]It was insane.
[69:35.52]It was just so wild.
[69:38.74]It was so fucked up.
[69:39.44]The art style was so cool in that game though.
[69:49.37]Maybe I get like nostalgia and you want to play it so bad again.
[69:52.45]Like you wish you could just go back and just do everything again.
[69:54.29]I kind of feel that way with the pizza tower stream.
[69:58.14]I was having such a good time.
[69:59.18]I just wish I could do it again.
[70:05.00]What does that mean?
[70:08.08]Jesus.
[70:13.24]I think I'm going the right way.
[70:14.46]I'm missing a lot of stuff though.
[70:18.10]He's doing his bit voice.
[70:23.23]You can always tell.
[70:23.91]Yeah, that's true.
[70:25.79]Whenever I lower my tone and I talk really like this and I'm just like, that's, you got it.
[70:33.57]You're right.
[70:33.91]That's my bit voice.
[70:36.26]That's my like slightly kind of, you know, really slowed down, mellow.
[70:42.48]Yeah.
[70:42.82]I mean, I just wish it like, you know, that's how you can tell.
[70:48.28]Although, here's the problem, though.
[70:50.02]I have talked with that tone when talking about serious stuff, too.
[70:55.76]So, I don't know.
[70:56.41]That's my I'm serious voice, but you can tell when it's pretend serious.
[71:00.53]Somehow.
[71:07.89]It's all a bit to you.
[71:13.09]Okay, I'm stop-locked.
[71:18.92]No, not everything is a bit.
[71:20.52]Just most things are.
[71:29.82]I think, honestly, I like to operate in a world, like in my own world here, where really, really important shit is not a bit.
[71:38.91]course, but I stream to have fun.
[71:43.69]That's what I'm doing here.
[71:45.97]So that's why I've always said like 90% of the things you hear on stream are just me having fun because that's what I want to do here.
[71:51.46]That's what I'm doing here.
[71:53.26]I don't really have another purpose here besides to try to have like fun, make a fun environment.
[71:57.84]That's it.
[71:58.96]So yeah.
[72:02.16]So let's talk about that time that I, um,
[72:07.22]When's Breath of the Wild Season 2?
[72:11.20]No, go back.
[72:11.78]There's so much more shit over here.
[72:14.76]That was the serious voice.
[72:15.86]But yeah, but it wasn't a bit though.
[72:18.27]You see what I'm saying?
[72:18.87]You understand the difference?
[72:20.33]That was not a bit.
[72:21.19]That was me being for real.
[72:28.87]Are we a joke to you?
[72:34.82]No.
[72:44.94]Sorry, I couldn't hold it in.
[72:55.66]Santa, holy shit.
[72:59.38]He's cracking.
[73:07.66]Hey, by the way, nobody counted that down.
[73:09.76]I see you all moved on from that one real quick.
[73:15.52]I want that.
[73:24.53]Why do you keep ignoring the Breath of the Wild question?
[73:28.71]I'm not.
[73:29.65]I'm gonna play it.
[73:30.51]I just don't know.
[73:38.67]I don't know what I'm going to do.
[73:46.62]I've got obviously things that I would like to play.
[73:48.76]Breath of the Wild is one of them.
[74:07.74]I meant to say finish it.
[74:13.42]No, I don't know why I haven't played it again.
[74:15.48]Honestly, it doesn't have anything to do with... I can't really speak to a reason why.
[74:19.77]Oh my god.
[74:22.89]Okay, hold on.
[74:23.69]Let me follow this for a second.
[74:38.39]Nice.
[74:44.20]Holy shit, that was cool.
[74:46.04]Oh, I wish I could just run fast through this like everybody else that plays this game did.
[74:50.92]I wish I just could run through them like everybody else did.
[74:55.55]Everybody else did it that way, but I didn't.
[74:57.89]Um, what?
[75:19.50]Really, really cool.
[75:22.80]Oh, hot sauce on pizza is actually like a 10 out of 10.
[75:28.01]You should get banned for like five minutes someday.
[75:29.61]I think it'd be pretty thrilling.
[75:31.67]It would also probably like potentially ruin my life.
[75:34.31]So I don't think I want to.
[75:38.94]But when you get banned for five... Yeah, you don't get banned for five minutes on Twitch.
[75:44.58]Banned for five minutes?! !
[75:47.31]That's a bathroom break.
[75:49.49]When I go pee, should I just say I'm getting banned?
[75:58.50]What am I doing here?
[76:09.86]Is there a tutorial I should... Oh, I hold... What?
[76:18.94]Holy shit.
[76:21.34]Holy crap.
[76:30.53]Banned for five minutes.
[76:32.45]Yeah, guys, Twitch bans do not operate the same way as when you get timed out in this channel for saying something strange.
[76:51.76]Although, I mean, some people have been banned here for a pretty long time.
[77:04.61]Some people get banned permanently.
[77:30.63]Did you say you were sorry?
[77:50.75]Oh shit.
[77:52.38]I wasn't prepared for that, but now I have to go.
[78:20.22]No, I'm getting that.
[78:30.99]Oh, nipper!
[79:02.66]This is the best song in the game.
[79:07.84]I got two minutes.
[79:28.84]Free milk.
[79:31.88]Oh, shit.
[79:34.40]What?
[79:35.89]Okay, well, I got a 51 hit combo!
[79:53.93]A good baseline can change anything.
[79:58.99]That changes everything.
[80:06.83]I think the bass player, the bass, does not get the credit that I think a lot of people deserve.
[80:13.94]The bass of a song is what holds the whole, it's the glue of the whole song.
[80:16.74]10 bucks.
[80:31.42]go up another floor no no no uh did I do this one what's this music the pig city the person didn't do anything wrong
[81:08.54]what long shrimp oh does anybody else feel this way if okay I'm not a big shrimp person when shrimp is I want to say more I don't like big shrimp they're too meaty and they're too weird I don't like it when shrimp goes above a certain size I no longer like it
[81:53.23]Get in.
[81:53.67]Hold on.
[82:01.96]What?
[82:02.16]What?
[82:04.00]Um, okay.
[82:06.68]He's smoking.
[82:07.92]Oh god.
[82:22.05]Hey Wally, get off me!
[82:23.23]What the fuck?
[82:41.29]Pineapple on pizza?
[82:42.43]Couldn't fucking be there.
[83:02.42]But Jerma, what about the sweet and savory and sweet and salty- Stop.
[83:05.92]I don't wanna hear it.
[83:28.40]Come on, I can break it going this way.
[83:29.84]I know I can.
[83:32.65]Oh my god, bro.
[83:33.37]Didn't even think about the sweet and savory.
[83:35.27]Yeah, you did.
[83:37.15]Uh, I'm gonna be completely real with you.
[83:48.29]Let's talk.
[83:50.36]Pineapple on pizza, it's not the fact that there's pineapple on the pizza, because pineapple, as those of you that have been here for years, that's probably my favorite fruit.
[83:58.81]Pineapple is my favorite fruit.
[84:00.71]Pineapple maybe in banana, in lemon.
[84:04.47]But it's a textural thing.
[84:07.28]Pineapple is very fibrous.
[84:10.70]And it's very fibrous and stringy sometimes.
[84:14.76]It doesn't match with the pizza for me.
[84:17.48]I love pineapple.
[84:19.38]It's just the fibrous pineapple does not match with the crust and the sauce.
[84:23.82]This doesn't do it for me.
[84:25.80]If you like it, it's been good for you.
[84:28.32]I'm glad you do.
[84:29.90]Get it away from me and never talk about it in my presence again.
[84:35.95]Good for you, though.
[84:36.65]I'm glad.
[84:37.59]I'm happy for you.
[84:55.42]I wonder if I should have gone the other way first.
[84:58.52]Wait, hold on.
[85:04.40]Banana on pizza?
[85:07.38]Um... I can't believe it happened again.
[85:16.09]I can't believe it happened again.
[85:24.69]No, we're good.
[85:31.22]I don't like warm pineapple.
[85:33.58]Yeah, I think you just actually figured it out for me.
[85:36.42]Seriously.
[85:38.55]If I'm really honest.
[85:39.37]Oh, come on.
[85:40.59]At least I got it.
[85:43.97]Okay.
[85:45.29]Um...
[85:47.35]To me, fruit should be cold.
[85:49.99]I like when fruit is cold, not when it's hot.
[85:53.18]I think you just unlock the reason why I don't like apple pie.
[85:59.00]I'm not like a big warm apples, like warm fruits.
[86:03.01]It just doesn't do it.
[86:03.65]I think that's what it is.
[86:05.47]Apple cider is not the same because it's a drink.
[86:11.04]It's a drink.
[86:11.68]I drink hot coffee.
[86:14.02]I drink iced coffee too.
[86:15.28]I don't prefer it either way.
[86:17.55]But I do like hot coffee.
[86:34.42]Blueberry pie?
[86:37.92]No, my top pies are banana cream and then chocolate cream.
[86:47.48]I like the cream-based pies, like banana cream.
[86:49.81]Banana cream pie is... It's so high up on S tier that it's an insult if anybody thinks, anyone thinks that it's even close to anything else.
[86:58.33]When you talk about pies, banana cream pie is S++++.
[87:02.99]Every other fucking pie is like, could be S or lower.
[87:06.70]Not even close.
[87:09.00]And mods, I'm getting real sick of people fucking talking like this.
[87:12.34]Just start timing people out that disagree with me.
[87:13.94]I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.
[87:21.57]I'm sorry.
[87:22.61]I'm like a weirdo.
[87:26.63]I'm in a good mood today.
[87:27.55]I don't know.
[87:50.01]Today?
[87:50.35]Tonight?
[87:51.13]Hey, alright, let me ask you about that.
[87:53.05]Do you want to talk semantics?
[87:56.01]Is it today or is it tonight?
[87:57.55]And does today still work?
[87:58.79]Because it technically is still the same day.
[88:05.61]No, it's today.
[88:06.57]It's still the same day.
[88:18.87]I love that laugh.
[88:19.73]Who did some of the voice work?
[88:21.58]Nice fucking job, seriously.
[88:23.16]You get it.
[88:25.94]If it's not just stock sounds, I mean.
[88:42.30]It's a vague question.
[88:44.82]I still think today works, because when you say a day, you know, Sunday, right?
[88:51.38]Monday, Tuesday.
[88:53.70]It's not Tuesday night.
[88:54.84]You know, at 7 o'clock on Tuesday, it does not become Tuesday night.
[89:03.15]Checkmate.
[89:26.24]Yeah, you would say it is Thursday night.
[89:28.70]It's still Thursday, Thursday night.
[89:30.96]It's not Thursday night.
[89:44.11]This all is crazy.
[89:58.61]Are they drinking a milkshake?
[90:00.49]That's funny.
[90:01.09]Oh, that's funny.
[90:33.36]Thermal, watch this.
[90:34.64]Backflip.
[90:35.32]What the... Holy sh... Oh my god, dude!
[90:38.34]Whoa!
[90:41.10]What the fuck?
[90:42.26]That was... That was awesome!
[90:44.54]You can just do that?
[90:46.67]From your chair?
[90:48.87]I've never seen someone do that before.
[90:50.65]Like, from your... From a seated position.
[90:52.81]Holy shit, man.
[90:53.57]You should, like, call somebody.
[90:56.27]Sound like the news or something.
[91:11.29]Imagine somebody seated in a chair and just lunging themselves up and back to the point where they could backflip out of the chair.
[91:18.23]There's probably some performers or something that can probably do something similar.
[91:32.12]like that's incredibly dangerous and should never be attempted.
[91:55.18]I think my buddy Eric could do it.
[91:56.30]Oh, that should absolutely never be attempted.
[91:59.78]Buddy Eric should never attempt that.
[92:01.06]Do not attempt that.
[92:01.84]That's it.
[92:03.68]Piece of pizza with a piece of fish on it.
[92:14.58]Will you do lap two?
[92:15.40]From my understanding, lap two can only happen if you beat the level already.
[92:18.96]So I have to go back and do it again.
[92:29.08]Eric is different.
[92:31.46]You made Eric up.
[92:33.80]That's the difference.
[92:37.41]Yes, Eric is different.
[92:55.71]Uh-oh.
[92:56.57]Here comes the best song in the game.
[92:57.97]I want to see tons of people dancing.
[92:59.83]I want to see tons of cat dancing, rat dancing.
[93:05.74]I'm not doing that.
[93:17.92]I'm not doing this well at all.
[93:35.70]What the heck just happened?
[94:10.43]I got fucking crazy.
[94:15.05]Does somebody have to be driving to have that reaction?
[94:40.59]Only a bee!
[94:42.25]Fix that.
[94:50.68]Somebody else to kill.
[95:05.16]Ah, well.
[95:10.06]I think I spent too much time in the taxis.
[95:11.50]Let's do it.
[95:18.97]If you got two taxis, add them.
[95:31.54]No secrets either.
[95:32.18]Yeah, that is kind of junk.
[95:50.67]I'll try the boss.
[95:52.57]I got one more level here.
[95:57.93]And the boss.
[96:02.86]Uh-oh.
[96:03.44]What is this?
[96:23.38]Pepino versus Pepino.
[96:33.97]What?
[96:34.27]I don't get it.
[96:39.63]Okay.
[96:41.67]What is he...
[96:53.43]Oh, do I just have to fight?
[96:54.85]He doesn't blink.
[96:55.43]Okay, I'll just fight him.
[97:48.56]Oh!
[97:49.80]Oh my god!
[97:50.60]Did I get the head?
[98:17.25]Damn it.
[98:18.64]Okay, this is crazy.
[98:20.12]This is crazy.
[98:26.14]He sucks.
[98:27.00]No.
[98:29.91]You're trying to bait a paragraph out of me from me to like yell at you.
[99:08.88]Shit, I forgot the turn.
[99:54.14]to the middle, by the way.
[99:54.98]Come on.
[99:57.32]That was dumb tracking.
[100:02.57]I thought he was hitable again.
[100:04.23]Alright, now what?
[100:35.12]Who do I attack?
[100:58.81]Jesus.
[101:14.06]Whoa.
[101:23.84]What the fuck?
[101:32.94]I'm gonna die.
[101:41.88]Oh man, this is really hard.
[101:45.08]This is very hard.
[101:45.94]This one's crazy.
[101:50.28]S tier on this one.
[101:51.32]Good luck.
[101:53.16]No hit run on this.
[101:56.11]No way.
[101:56.89]Let's see if I can parry it.
[102:13.00]I mean, I'd rather jump over it.
[102:16.49]Any game where I can dodge something, I'm way better at doing that than actually parrying it.
[103:32.62]Shit.
[103:33.46]I thought I was ready.
[103:34.22]Where am I?
[103:35.18]Wrong one.
[103:41.39]I'll take a B on this.
[103:45.67]Help.
[103:47.31]When you get trapped, you just fucked.
[103:51.27]I'll take a C on this one.
[103:52.39]Okay, this one's really, really hard.
[104:16.36]Don't do this to me like that.
[104:17.78]I can't even get the health up.
[104:21.14]I can't even touch the health.
[104:33.69]Cocaine game.
[105:28.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[105:29.41]Why did this happen?
[105:29.99]What?
[105:30.15]This didn't happen last time.
[105:34.69]Oh, my God.
[105:37.94]Crack game.
[105:41.84]Stop.
[105:44.11]Oh, my goodness.
[105:44.95]Stop getting attached to every wall.
[106:00.44]I think I'm fine.
[106:03.66]Did I do it?
[106:04.22]Whoa.
[106:13.16]Was I just completely just blanked right there?
[106:20.64]Do not enter.
[106:21.78]Do not enter inside.
[106:23.26]Do not go inside.
[106:24.16]Should I leave?
[106:44.78]Rack game.
[106:47.64]I can do better than that.
[106:56.46]That face.
[106:57.55]I'm just realizing that face.
[107:38.95]That backwards jump, never seen that before.
[108:06.99]Backwards jump?
[108:46.60]Excuse me?
[108:50.28]Excuse me?
[108:59.58]Why did I not parry that when he ran by me?
[109:01.26]I don't care.
[109:03.85]I'm leaving.
[109:14.88]Did I?
[109:15.40]Yeah, I did them all, didn't I?
[109:20.15]Nope, I have that one more, but let's see.
[109:32.47]Staff only.
[109:36.58]Get out.
[109:43.90]elusive p rank you can get it by doing everything there is to do in a level problem is that you need to keep a combo for the entirety of the level it's a tough challenge so don't feel bad if you don't want to do it it's not just not get hit it's you have to keep a combo going the whole entire time holy how come you don't have uh tts um
[110:10.21]It's, it's very, I'm an incredibly distractible person and I feel like TTS, TTS would just distract me every five seconds and I would never be able to pay attention to anything ever.
[110:29.05]I've never done it before and I probably will never do it ever.
[110:35.96]Although, honestly, I can appreciate... Obviously, you watch some streamers that have TTS on, and sometimes it can be really, really funny.
[110:45.41]Honestly, TTS for a lot of other streamers kind of, in a way, is sort of a one-guy moment.
[110:51.33]Because there's been tons of moments where I've seen a stream where a TTS was just hilarious.
[110:56.55]And it's just like, wow, okay, well that's funny.
[110:59.42]But also, TTS can get spammed pretty hard.
[111:03.68]And there's a difference, I think, between TTS spam and somebody saying something funny, I guess.
[111:09.58]Um...
[111:10.28]But it's like, I don't know, it's a community engagement.
[111:12.04]It's a way to get, like, your audience to be able to, like, hang out, participate, make jokes, make references, do whatever they want.
[111:18.73]Um, but it's just not here.
[111:20.43]I understand why people do it, though.
[111:25.77]Just mute it?
[111:27.30]Yeah.
[111:29.06]Take a stance.
[111:29.98]That's a centrist idea.
[111:31.22]I mean, I just told you I don't do it, and I don't want to do it, but I can understand why somebody would do it.
[111:37.82]Is that centrist?
[111:43.77]I did take a stance, that is my stance, that no, I don't like it and I don't want to do it.
[111:53.45]Okay, the centrist stance with that would be TTS, interesting idea.
[111:58.26]Well, on one hand, I can see why I would do it.
[112:01.38]I might, I'm thinking about it, but I haven't decided yet.
[112:04.66]I think that what I would like to do with TTS is maybe look into it a little bit more and see why it would be on.
[112:11.16]But the other case, it being off,
[112:13.48]It's like being on, I could see that.
[112:15.64]No, I took a stance.
[112:16.92]Uh-oh, he's getting stun-locked.
[112:27.07]All right, I want to go to the other level.
[112:32.09]That's pretty much what you said.
[112:33.15]No, I made my stance on how I feel about it.
[112:38.10]Then I told you how I can still understand it because it's like a one-guy moment for some people.
[112:43.73]And here's another thing.
[112:45.33]How about this?
[112:46.45]Centrist take.
[112:47.29]You ready?
[112:48.69]A lot of streamers that have huge, huge audiences, and I'm talking into the tens of thousands, right?
[112:55.07]How do you get a one guy moment?
[112:56.17]You can't even read.
[112:57.80]Sometimes you can't even see what anybody is saying, right?
[113:01.56]Like I can understand that.
[113:05.50]This channel is still at a point where I can look over here and I can see at least for a second sometimes what somebody is saying.
[113:24.64]What's your review of the game so far?
[113:27.40]Well, on one hand, I can see how somebody would like this game.
[113:32.36]It's got really cool artwork.
[113:33.94]It's got really interesting scenarios.
[113:36.76]I can see how some people would want to play it and get something out of that.
[113:40.02]But on the other hand, it's a cocaine game.
[113:42.08]And I can see how some people would be really, really hard to play.
[113:47.62]It's super intense.
[113:49.28]So I can understand that.
[113:50.94]And that's my take.
[114:06.37]Alright, where's this last level that I didn't go to?
[114:13.96]Pizza Scare.
[114:14.64]What's that?
[114:30.47]Castlevania?
[114:31.17]Yeah.
[114:31.79]Cool.
[114:47.06]Can you please be more in the middle?
[114:55.64]Please be more in the middle.
[115:00.96]I am Thanos.
[115:01.88]I am Thanos.
[115:02.77]I am Thanos.
[115:14.41]What does that do?
[115:27.46]What's this doing?
[115:35.43]Kill the ghosts.
[115:36.39]Do I just kill them all?
[115:37.53]Like, do I have to kill them all?
[115:38.93]Is that, like, part of this?
[115:43.29]Is it literally... Yeah, I know it said kill the ghosts, but do I have to kill them all to, like, progress or something?
[115:51.94]Does it matter?
[115:52.44]It just gives me the ability to...
[116:17.46]A lot of things in this level can just stop you in your tracks and hurt you.
[116:33.87]Everything can hurt you in this level.
[116:47.38]What's happening right now?
[116:49.56]What's going on?
[116:50.40]This thing's just OK.
[116:52.65]Get out of here.
[117:17.68]This level's too stressful.
[117:18.46]I don't like it.
[117:33.48]It doesn't let me slow down and explore Peppino's world.
[118:06.36]How do you break the bowling pins in this one?
[118:37.22]Whoa!
[118:55.14]Voting to kick me?
[118:57.63]Yeah.
[119:05.13]It's not gonna happen.
[119:10.23]How do I get that?
[119:12.01]I gotta turn him into a thingy.
[119:17.13]How do I turn him into a thingy?
[119:19.76]Here we go.
[119:21.22]Wait, what?
[119:27.84]I gotta go faster than that, huh?
[119:35.85]There's a lot of little hops in this level.
[119:37.47]Like tiny little ones.
[119:38.94]Just keep fucking moving.
[119:40.08]Do it again.
[119:44.53]Do it again.
[119:45.15]All the little fucking hops.
[120:16.59]Am I?
[120:17.39]Did I just not do that?
[120:20.15]Deployed it?
[120:33.84]This is elite gameplay.
[120:37.30]Do you have any idea how hard this game is?
[120:40.42]Do you have any idea?
[120:42.30]You know how hard this game is, right?
[120:44.46]Do you have any idea?
[120:46.85]It's simply not just left and right and jump.
[120:49.53]You get attached to surfaces.
[120:51.39]Like the Roadrunner game for the SNES.
[120:54.39]Do you have any idea how hard I'm working right now?
[120:56.79]Do you have any idea how hard I'm working right here?
[120:58.59]Fuck, come on.
[121:16.53]This level has got so many bumps.
[121:20.76]Too many hidden enemies, too many bumps.
[121:23.26]I rate this level a 5 out of 10.
[121:45.62]skeleton looks like you too many too many look at this too many bumps too many like wasting it all right too many bumps
[122:22.07]Can you do your best auto impression?
[122:23.49]Yeah, sure.
[122:25.66]What, um... I'm gonna slow it down a little.
[122:45.70]Where am I going?
[123:05.97]Oh, I thought this thing was active.
[123:16.24]What?
[123:18.32]What?
[123:20.95]What?
[123:23.83]What?
[123:54.06]Too many fucking bumps!
[123:55.12]I gotta wait, I have to wait, I have to wait, I have to wait, I can't, I have to wait.
[124:07.39]The whole thing's fucked up.
[124:08.11]The whole thing's fucked up, I gotta go back.
[124:21.52]That's too many goddamn bumps in this fucking level, I swear to god.
[124:51.81]Why did I take the ladder?
[124:53.11]Funny.
[125:23.03]No, dude, I have to... Oh my god.
[125:28.98]No, go down!
[125:35.88]Go down!
[125:36.46]I hate this level so much.
[126:07.81]Just get me out of here.
[126:08.37]I'm never playing this level ever again.
[126:22.08]I got all the toppings.
[126:22.96]I'm never going in here again.
[126:51.70]Where's my... How come it's... Did it get darker?
[127:08.07]I feel like it didn't look like this.
[127:10.25]I feel like it was brighter.
[127:10.91]Alright, well that's that.
[127:21.45]You know, you could really could lose some weight.
[127:23.81]Hey.
[127:23.89]What about what's up there?
[127:39.33]Do you have anything to say?
[127:47.88]No?
[127:51.86]You missed a level on the last floor?
[127:57.04]Oh, you're right, I did.
[127:58.00]Whatever this one was.
[128:11.67]Oh my god.
[128:16.21]This is so bizarre looking.
[128:41.64]Okay.
[128:43.52]No, I can't destroy that.
[129:01.21]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[129:01.87]Throw it.
[129:02.91]Oh, that's right.
[129:03.35]The bomb's right.
[129:06.31]Let me go back down.
[129:09.65]There was a bomb spawner down here, wasn't there?
[129:17.54]Where was that rat?
[129:18.18]No.
[129:20.12]Where was the rat?
[129:23.50]Up a little bit higher?
[129:31.74]God damn it.
[129:38.80]Oh, it's up here.
[129:40.81]Okay.
[129:49.86]It's stuck.
[129:50.56]It's okay.
[129:50.90]Oh, so another thing that I'm still having trouble getting used to is holding right trigger forever when you want to stay running.
[130:06.37]It's just like my... I can't do it.
[130:26.30]Hmm.
[130:39.53]You'll hold Y forever, but not right trigger.
[130:41.79]Yeah, because over a hundred years of video games, holding Y, holding, well, it's X on the Xbox, has been like, run!
[130:52.03]Super Mario made that very clear over the last hundred years.
[131:02.76]When the Pilgrims were playing Mario... They were holding Y. Is that it?
[131:29.87]Eons of gaming.
[131:33.34]It's probably Lab 2.
[131:40.41]Oh, I gotta jump.
[132:04.66]It's incredible precision to get this correct.
[132:07.34]Incredible precision.
[132:08.60]Really?
[132:25.93]When you get it, it's so much fun.
[132:32.13]When you get in one of those modes where you're just sprinting the whole time.
[132:37.05]What's this?
[132:51.48]What?
[132:52.16]I'm so confused.
[132:54.68]What was going on right there?
[132:55.62]Did I do something wrong?
[132:58.00]What did I just do?
[132:59.00]I literally was reading chat.
[133:00.42]Did I do it?
[133:04.47]I started hearing screams.
[133:06.59]I was reading what happened.
[133:08.43]I looked over and things were just dead.
[133:13.75]Usually with those secret rooms you have, they don't just complete themselves.
[133:17.54]That's weird.
[133:18.38]Oh my god.
[133:36.60]Is this thing door stuck?
[133:44.05]Where'd it go?
[133:45.45]What is going on?
[133:49.55]Oh, I thought there was a wall!
[134:12.48]No!
[134:14.10]No, I want the- I want the toppings!
[134:40.61]Okay.
[134:47.17]Sick.
[134:47.35]Yeah, I don't want to go too, too fast.
[134:54.44]I'll Ruin Stop, then.
[135:17.15]Flap and spin.
[135:21.69]Oh, God.
[135:22.09]This is going to be fun.
[135:45.48]Keep the combo going.
[135:46.12]This is the only place I'm going to get an A from here.
[136:05.07]Keep going.
[136:05.43]Keep going.
[136:05.85]This is the only way I'm going to get an A.
[136:11.52]so so
[136:40.09]Oh don't do me like that.
[137:09.79]I don't like mushrooms on my pizza.
[137:11.21]Neither do I. You sound like a fucking smart dude.
[137:18.45]You sound fucking smart.
[137:28.22]Oh, shit.
[137:29.94]Come on.
[137:30.82]It's all right.
[137:32.78]I could have gone.
[137:33.74]I could go back and get it, but I don't want to do it again.
[137:46.04]No time.
[138:47.17]Hi, I'm new here.
[138:48.29]You are not.
[138:50.08]I've seen your name many times.

[139:58.16]Are they scared?
[140:04.08]Happy birthday.
[140:09.68]Looks scary.
[140:13.21]Don't make a sound.
[140:14.37]This place is weird.
[140:20.47]Oh my god, FNAF.
[140:52.13]I gotta get up there.
[140:54.63]Really?
[140:55.63]What's up there?

[143:16.01]C I can understand.
[143:16.79]A million times.
[143:22.92]Try to get a D?
[143:25.84]Is just don't kill any enemies?
[143:29.16]Just try to get to the end of the... Just go to the end of the level and just avoid everything.

[144:51.10]Oh no!
[144:51.46]What do I do?
[144:52.06]Whoa!

[148:48.80]What's going on?
[148:49.36]How are you doing?
[148:50.87]I want to sneak in that way.
[148:51.97]It's not about speed.
[149:03.69]It's about getting it done.
[149:06.03]It's only about speed when you have to run with the timer.
[149:16.92]Nothing?
[149:19.94]Okay.
[149:21.96]I feel like there was a fight.
[149:29.18]Come on, there's gotta be something here, right?
[149:51.17]Jesus.
[149:56.23]All right, let's go.
[149:58.13]This game makes my head hurt or something.
[150:06.44]Let's clean.
[150:24.29]This level's really fun.
[150:25.11]I like this one.
[150:26.67]I give this level a... A. Alright, well... What?
[150:41.62]What?
[150:43.99]Oh my goodness!
[151:04.90]Okay, this is where it starts.
[151:06.30]I need to get up there quick.
[151:10.48]Oh.
[151:11.50]Uh-oh.
[151:17.41]No, my B-Rank!
[151:30.07]Downstairs?
[151:41.89]Holy shit.
[151:43.31]WHOA!

[152:01.12]Oh, he already broke it, I can just run.
[152:16.00]All three of them here.
[152:25.37]Oh.
[152:25.61]I don't know, I feel like... I thought I had to go... I don't know, I thought I had to go down.
[152:30.85]Oops.
[152:36.14]Oh shit, okay.
[152:37.58]I thought that was a secret.
[152:47.30]No janitor.
[152:47.70]It's over.
[152:58.19]Gun.
[153:01.95]Shoot?
[153:03.07]Or shoot down?
[153:13.98]But how do I get up there?
[153:19.63]Oh, I can- okay, cool.
[153:23.65]Oh, pineapple on pizza.
[154:36.70]Where are they?
[154:37.24]Where are they?
[154:38.10]Where are they?
[155:11.34]What do I do?
[155:13.04]How do I fix this?
[155:13.61]How do I fix it?
[155:20.15]No!
[155:20.75]Come back to life.
[155:21.27]Oh my god.
[156:13.23]You shot all of them.
[156:27.02]22.
[156:27.04]That's not bad.
[156:31.96]170.
[156:33.38]Only one more level.
[156:35.60]In Pizza Tower.
[156:40.26]Well, I want to... Can I go up here?
[156:44.51]I can, can't I?
[156:46.49]What's up there?
[156:48.15]What are they hiding from me?
[157:02.95]super jump.
[157:04.07]Will I go?
[157:04.47]Will I make it?
[157:12.81]No, dude.
[157:13.35]I'm going to start from over here.
[157:27.82]Oh, that's how.
[157:28.64]Okay.
[157:29.12]That's what I'm supposed to do.
[157:31.84]210. 210.
[157:37.26]This is the last level.
[157:39.29]War.
[157:39.91]Uh oh.
[157:50.91]This is going to be a stressful last level, isn't it?
[157:57.11]I'm just going to run.
[158:26.03]All right.
[158:36.64]I gotta get in there.
[158:38.62]Oh, monk.
[158:39.42]You idiot.
[159:28.36]Three seconds!
[159:30.66]No!
[159:31.10]Okay, I've... Oh, man.
[159:36.54]Okay, this one's hard.
[159:38.98]This one's crazy.
[159:40.28]This one's fun, though.
[159:43.59]All right.
[159:44.21]I gotta... I gotta stop shooting.
[159:46.65]I'm sorry.
[159:47.09]In a game where you give me a gun with unlimited ammo, I'm just gonna be... I don't know.
[159:52.55]Monka, get Robert down or do it to you, okay?
[159:53.67]Okay.
[160:22.23]Stop doing that.
[160:27.69]Whatever.
[160:36.59]Shit.
[161:12.56]I wanted it so bad.
[161:13.82]Stop throwing for the bell.
[161:24.81]I need it though.
[161:25.69]It's extra points.
[161:37.80]What am I doing wrong?
[161:38.70]I keep killing this thing.
[161:39.94]Oops.
[162:14.11]Timer stops.
[162:15.55]Timer does not stop.
[162:16.55]Timer does not stop.
[162:17.83]Timer doesn't stop.
[162:19.45]Timer doesn't stop.
[162:21.85]What?
[162:28.86]No!
[162:32.58]No!
[162:34.50]No!
[162:35.04]I thought it stopped.
[162:36.72]I thought the timer stopped.
[162:48.93]All right, I'm not gonna shoot at anything and I don't care about the bells.
[162:59.79]I'm just going.
[163:01.53]I don't care.
[163:03.98]This level is way too intense for me to give a shit about bells.
[163:33.54]Except for that one.
[163:36.19]Oops.
[163:36.81]I blew it.
[163:38.46]I got three bells.
[163:39.10]It's alright.
[163:39.56]No more bells.
[164:08.70]Boom.
[164:09.34]Boom.
[164:37.98]But just stop spamming me.
[165:18.27]SHOOT THE GUN DOWNWARDS!
[165:35.24]FUCK!
[165:39.86]Nooo!
[165:40.40]I have to do it!
[165:41.18]I knew it!
[165:41.80]I knew I was gonna have to...
[166:04.03]That's like his problem.
[166:10.25]Who are these people?
[166:23.24]Stop!
[166:24.82]Oh!
[166:36.57]No, it's not worth it, just go.
[167:10.83]Hurry up.
[167:13.83]Hurry up.
[167:25.04]I made it.
[167:31.62]I need a few points to get A. I need like two points.
[167:35.80]I need 10,000.
[167:36.02]Come on.
[167:49.04]I needed like one or two more people to whatever.
[167:52.52]Okay.
[167:56.47]I got all the toppings.
[168:05.87]220.
[168:07.13]Come to Mr. Stick to rent a boss stage.
[168:08.95]I think this is it.
[168:19.10]What's this?
[168:19.60]That's creepy.
[168:58.08]That thing's gonna move, isn't it?
[168:59.22]It's gonna chase me.
[169:01.55]It's gonna be a pizza.
[169:02.95]The last boss is a giant pizza.
[169:29.15]this is the pizza tower is it not what happened okay for a second I thought it reset my whole game
[169:55.44]I just want to know if there's something at the bottom.
[169:58.76]You know, there's tons of secrets in this game.
[170:00.09]Who knows if there was something on the ledge to the left or something.
[170:03.23]I don't know.
[170:04.87]I thought it reset the whole game for a second.
[170:06.68]I was like, no, it did not.
[170:26.25]The fun part is remembering where all the elevators are.
[170:28.31]Any new clothes?
[170:36.44]I'll go with the red one.
[170:48.45]At least we get to look through the areas one more time.
[171:09.06]There's a spot to go over there.
[171:12.78]90?
[171:18.00]What is this for?
[171:25.10]Nothing else?
[171:27.66]Okay, well, I won't... I just want to see what's down here.
[171:44.11]It's a pizza, pizza face.
[171:50.86]Oh God.
[171:51.32]OK.
[172:05.84]Yep, it's just like Bowser from SNES.
[172:08.54]The last boss and it's gonna be the same shit.
[172:14.07]I played that probably five to six thousand times, so I probably won't get hit once.
[173:00.85]Damn it.
[173:03.25]Damn it.
[173:03.79]Press it too many times.
[173:04.47]All right.
[173:09.45]I'm just like, I'm just rushing.
[173:10.53]I don't know why.
[173:11.15]You know when you get that mode where you're just like, you know, go, go fast.
[173:13.49]I don't care.
[173:13.91]Just do it.
[174:12.52]Sorry.
[174:12.80]You gotta clear it.
[174:27.68]You gotta start clearing.
[174:54.75]But done He took the tv What oh don't get hit by
[175:25.95]What the fuck?
[175:29.62]There's too many things happening.
[175:58.76]FUUUUCK!
[176:00.40]Oh my god!
[176:04.03]Oh, that's just carnage!
[176:11.23]Damn it!
[176:13.21]Oh, that stinks!
[176:14.29]It was... I could have had it too, but it was just... At some point you get it out of that focus state, and it's just everything is just... Colors are blending together and things are screaming at you.
[176:28.63]I can stay in that state for a solid minute, two minutes.
[176:34.27]After that, though, it's like everything kind of starts... My brain can't... I hate my brain.
[176:37.82]I hate my brain.
[176:38.32]I hate my brain can't... Because I hate... You know what?
[176:40.06]My brain can't... Oh, my God.
[176:48.74]Restart.
[176:55.93]I gotta... This is gonna be way cleaner.
[176:58.52]oh fuck off
[178:02.26]Alright, and I have a health right there.
[178:03.35]Let's go.
[178:03.79]That's it.
[178:06.89]They don't despawn, right?
[178:25.62]So he does not hurt you.
[178:28.68]I'm realizing that now.
[178:29.46]I thought he was.
[179:03.78]All right.
[179:06.09]All right.
[179:18.42]I got it.
[179:19.70]Let's go.
[179:20.00]Is that an S?
[179:20.46]Is that an S?
[179:20.92]I just got an S?
[179:28.85]Uh-oh.
[179:34.14]Oh no.
[179:43.61]What the hell?
[179:46.07]No!
[179:47.09]Oh goodness gracious me.
[179:50.87]Oh goodness, I need to breathe for a second because I'm not ready for this.
[180:11.23]Thank God you don't have to do the whole fight.
[180:12.79]Okay, I'm way, way less scared now.
[180:23.29]Oh, we have friends!
[180:28.61]Wait, what?
[180:31.99]Different fight.
[180:39.75]What?
[180:40.55]Grab him!
[180:41.29]What's going on here?
[180:48.26]I'm in so much trouble.
[180:53.30]Come on, here's my health!
[181:12.73]No!
[181:13.40]Perfect placement.
[181:14.24]That was just so unlucky.
[181:17.04]Just double unlucky.
[181:18.22]That was just fucked.
[181:20.72]Okay, this is incredibly difficult.
[181:26.12]That just fucked me so bad.
[181:28.23]When there was no gun in that second fight, it was just like, what is happening?
[181:35.63]Triple unlucky, yeah.
[181:42.05]I was looking for the gun.
[181:42.73]I was like, when's the gun spawn?
[181:44.13]Where's the gun?
[181:45.25]And it's like, no, throw your friend at him.
[181:46.61]I didn't want to pick that up.
[182:10.56]And that's a disaster.
[182:34.18]Unlucky.
[182:35.08]Oh, double unlucky.
[182:35.94]I tried to hit up.
[182:40.04]Oh, Quintruple Unlucky Interrupt.
[182:52.44]Fuck, this is hard.
[182:53.74]Ah, fuck.
[182:57.14]This is hard.
[183:02.27]Alright, I got it.
[183:02.85]Let's go.
[183:16.50]What the hell?
[184:03.77]What?
[184:04.05]Oh my goodness.
[184:07.06]You.
[184:10.08]What?
[184:10.44]Alright.
[184:12.66]Just grab someone and don't just throw them.
[184:24.71]God damn it.
[184:25.63]It's a fucking mess.
[184:33.66]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[185:23.66]Oh my god, that little cog just blends in with everything.
[185:27.24]Fuck you.
[185:42.12]Hey believers, let's hear it!
[186:00.55]I didn't want to pick it up.
[186:15.39]Sorry.
[186:46.56]Unfair.
[187:51.59]Oops!
[187:52.05]Goddammit.
[188:00.36]Sorry.
[188:00.64]I don't need it.
[188:32.83]Uh-oh.
[188:33.03]Get out of here!
[188:53.88]Whoa!
[189:06.93]Thought you were done!
[189:07.89]How many times do you have to do this?
[189:45.78]That's it.
[189:46.20]Is that it?
[189:51.51]Nice.
[190:15.35]Oh no.
[190:23.43]Oh.
[190:24.83]You see him?
[190:49.47]Crumbling Tower of Pizza.
[190:54.11]Oh, it's destroying.
[190:55.27]Okay.
[190:59.81]Go.
[191:03.05]Five minutes.
[191:07.19]I gotta go through every level.
[191:08.59]Let's go!
[191:09.05]Oh, there's my, um... Is he a friend?
[191:16.42]I can't really tell.
[191:27.61]That's the wrong way.
[191:28.25]We're gonna get out of here.
[192:02.58]I love how you're just not lying.
[192:03.76]It's funny.
[192:06.48]Whoa, Santa.
[192:11.49]Santa gonna come with us?
[192:12.19]Nah, he's a piece of shit.
[192:14.76]He's not coming with us.
[192:15.70]This Santa is.
[192:56.53]Sorry.
[192:59.69]Wait, is this other person coming with us?
[193:01.27]I thought this person was an enemy.
[193:06.56]That other pizza, the Latino guy.
[193:28.21]I mean, you got this shit up here.
[193:29.31]I'm gonna go look, right?
[193:34.15]What was that?
[193:34.75]It's the redemption arc.
[193:41.59]Oh, okay.
[193:47.38]Jesus.
[193:51.84]Oh my god!
[193:58.51]Dude, this reminds me of a cartoon.
[194:00.37]Don't minus two me.
[194:09.40]Don't minus two me.
[194:10.24]I'm the streamer.
[194:15.70]Primo Berg?
[194:16.52]What?
[194:18.40]I have no way.
[194:26.12]I failed it.
[194:26.58]Oh no, it's okay.
[194:27.36]I got a hot dog.
[194:28.19]Hot dogs are just as fine.
[194:50.25]Go!
[194:59.08]Chicken friend?
[195:04.02]Hurry up, go!
[195:14.91]Pineapple!
[195:16.41]Pineapple for those fucking weirdos that like that!
[195:19.07]Come on!
[195:20.67]Come on, I have to get the pineapple!
[195:23.71]Oh, fuck it, who cares?
[195:40.64]Irma said I was weird.
[195:58.13]Gotta get down.
[196:02.67]Oh, the Apple.
[196:08.04]jesus everybody dance quick I don't think you're weird if you get pineapple on pizza it was a joke kidding around don't worry
[196:45.48]We don't care about that.
[196:46.30]Cool.
[197:02.52]That was a very, very enjoyable game.
[197:25.04]Cool customers.
[197:25.92]It's very goofy, very good.
[197:34.01]It's very hard.
[197:36.91]A lot of challenge in it.
[197:40.30]Well, hard's... You could beat this game without even caring about getting high scores.
[197:48.22]Games like this are really cool.
[197:50.47]Because no matter what your skill level is, you're going to finish it.
[197:54.83]You just are.
[197:59.35]You can't die.
[198:02.48]It's just a score attack.
[198:05.16]So good or bad, everybody gets to enjoy it.
[198:08.42]It's kind of cool how that works out that way.
[198:21.12]I'm not going to get P on everything.
[198:22.30]I'm not going to get P on one level.
[198:45.73]Centrist take?
[198:48.22]Because I don't want to get
[199:01.92]What about Isaac?
[199:03.78]I'm probably going to stop here.
[199:05.33]It's a lot of stuff that has to happen this weekend.
[199:08.77]It's going to be very busy.
[199:12.95]But I pulled the stream back to today because I knew there was only like three or four hours in this game left.
[199:19.13]So I might as well just go, just get done, play it, have fun, and then get to work on some stuff.
[199:26.94]What about Frog Detective?
[199:28.34]Frog Detective will be before the end of February.
[199:38.39]It's still happening.
[199:39.17]I didn't make that up.
[199:44.21]Any post-credits enjoyers here?
[199:47.35]Let's see.
[199:53.77]Yeah, Hylix is as well.
[199:57.78]Let's see.
[199:58.10]Let me look at a good timetable here.
[200:05.55]Well, here's the thing.
[200:08.33]How long is Frog Detective 3?
[200:12.45]All of them have been 2 to 3 hours long, right?
[200:15.03]Like 3 hours?
[200:15.61]4 hours?
[200:20.24]They're only a couple hours each, aren't they?
[200:30.06]Depends on how fast you go.
[200:31.44]About 2 hours?
[200:33.26]Yeah, so, okay, here is the plan.
[200:38.28]I... Sasa's gonna say that there's no stream until early this coming week.
[200:43.80]And then probably on Monday or Tuesday, we're gonna play Frog Detective 3.
[200:49.39]And then after that, we're gonna move to Hylix in the same stream.
[200:55.39]That's the plan.
[201:06.74]And then after that, we'll see.
[201:12.34]In the same timeframe, I'm going to be talking a lot about Grotto Beasts.
[201:16.59]I know a lot of people are waiting for it.
[201:17.67]A lot of people excited for it.
[201:21.67]It's a, it has been a journey, but everybody on the team is incredibly excited for it.
[201:26.85]Everyone's super happy.
[201:33.44]Cannot wait to show you some things in the next five or six days.
[201:37.71]Is there going to be a lot of announcements?
[201:47.89]Yeah, set the sus for early next week.
[201:51.17]I mean, it's going to have to be Monday or Tuesday because otherwise I'm in breach of contract with chat or playing Frog Detective for the end of February.
[201:59.03]So it has to be then.
[202:04.99]What are you announcing?
[202:05.75]I'm announcing Grotto Beasts.
[202:10.99]You'll see.
[202:13.25]You'll see.
[202:20.82]It's going to be multi-layered.
[202:25.68]So there's going to be essentially two or three different times that you need to be aware of.
[202:32.40]We're doing our best to try to make sure as many people can get it.
[202:39.63]And what we're going to probably do a pre-sale to make sure, because I know a lot of people saying, but wait, what if it just goes on sale and I want it and then like somebody buys a thousand of them or something, right?
[202:49.10]We're going to make sure that that's not going to happen.
[202:54.23]We're doing a pre-sale.
[203:00.09]Is it a pyramid scheme?
[203:02.25]It's not a fucking pyramid scheme.
[203:08.78]Oh, my grand pyramid scheme.
[203:11.05]No, what the fuck?
[203:22.41]No, oh, because I said... I'm an idiot.
[203:25.11]I said multi-level.
[203:27.05]No, I said multi-layer.
[203:30.53]Shit.
[203:31.41]I did just say... I put multi in the front of that.
[203:34.60]I said multi-level.
[203:37.44]But I didn't... Oh, goddammit.
[203:39.20]Okay.
[203:39.94]I got...
[203:41.44]Multi-layered announcements is what I meant.
[203:44.52]Multi-layered rollout.
[203:46.67]Multi-layered rollout.
[203:48.11]Not multi-level marketing.
[203:50.73]Let's correct it immediately before everybody thinks, what the fuck is he talking about?
[203:54.15]That'd be so stupid.
[204:08.98]I would never.
[204:10.30]Oh my god.
[204:11.04]Alright, post credits?
[204:21.91]Anything?
[204:22.19]Or is it just on this for now?
[204:23.95]There's going to be a big FAQ that's going to answer a ton of questions as well.
[204:33.32]It's being worked on.
[204:34.70]We want to make sure everything's accurate there.
[204:38.42]Skip it.
[204:43.63]What's the game?
[204:44.11]Rate this game?
[204:52.65]Oh, he looks so stressed.
[204:54.85]Oh no.
[205:12.44]Uh, Pepino's Pizza animated film, when?
[205:19.30]Pepino's Pizza animated series, when?
[205:25.87]No, I'm just kidding.
[205:26.59]That was phenomenal.
[205:33.09]Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[205:39.01]Excellent.
[205:46.89]No, I got a D. That's the one, officer.
[206:15.37]Wow.
[206:16.79]Oh, well.
[206:17.19]Hey, D plus is passing grade.
[206:22.69]1% off.
[206:23.03]Too bad, yeah?
[206:24.00]Too bad.
[206:29.54]What a psycho.
[206:39.73]D is failing?
[206:40.59]D is not failing.
[206:45.44]That was awesome.
[206:47.26]Yeah, I'll see you guys next week, early next week.
[206:51.26]With a bunch of stuff to talk about.
[206:52.66]Again, we're really trying to shoot for that 28th of February.
[206:59.32]To really kind of start talking about a lot of stuff.
[207:04.54]It's come together.
[207:05.16]Like I told you very briefly before, but this project started off as kind of a little, oh, like a fun little thing to do.
[207:14.28]And then it grew into a decade of references and it's essentially just... You know, a lot of people ask about merch and, hey, how come you don't do merch?
[207:25.73]Why don't you have this merch?
[207:26.47]How come you don't do that merch?
[207:27.37]And I figured this is kind of an interesting thing to do.
[207:31.59]And having...
[207:33.77]hundreds of these cards that you could just get if you wanted to.
[207:37.09]No one's ever obligated to buy a single goddamn thing.
[207:41.45]But I just thought it was a fun, it's a fun idea for sort of this multi-year long, 10 plus years of merch that kind of combined into this one cool concept.
[207:58.18]He said multi again.
[208:09.65]Alright, let's say goodbye.
[208:14.61]Pizza, pizza time.
[208:16.84]Pizza, pizza time.
[208:18.88]Rate the game?
[208:21.40]That was a... Who cares what I have to say about rating the game?
[208:28.39]That was a... 9.0
[208:43.38]9.0.
[208:49.36]That was a 9.0.
[208:49.72]I would say that was great.
[208:56.70]I was thinking, is it an 8.9?
[208:57.28]Is it an 8.9?
[208:57.54]That's a 9.0.
[208:57.98]That was an excellent experience.
[208:58.80]That was very fun.
[209:16.64]Music was great.
[209:18.40]Level design was great.
[209:19.22]Except for that one level I didn't like.
[209:21.98]But that's just because I'm not very good.
[209:23.98]Bad gamer.
[209:31.53]But yeah.
[209:32.51]See you guys later.
[209:33.07]Have a great rest of your evening.
[209:36.17]I'll see you guys early next week.
[209:37.27]We have a lot to talk about.
[209:40.51]Hope everybody enjoys it.
[209:52.39]Bad gamer.
[209:59.19]See you soon.
[210:04.87]Can you do the Pepino scream impression?
[210:08.51]No, it's like 10 o'clock here.

[212:46.59]That's what I'm saying.
[212:47.91]No, it's all good.
[212:48.47]That's what I'm saying.
[212:57.07]Imagine you're a devout Catholic.
[212:59.89]You're just super religious.
[213:01.93]And then you hear the voice of God.
[213:03.71]Finally, after years of prayer.
