[ve:60.16.100]

[00:10.19]Yo, yo, yo, what up, guys?
[00:11.55]It's Jerma.
[00:12.83]Bringing you a live commentary tonight.
[00:14.75]I'm going to play a bunch of crap.
[00:16.53]Hopefully it's not longer than, like, a friggin', like, 30 minutes or something like that.
[00:20.33]But what do you think about that intro?
[00:22.98]That's a pretty sick intro, huh?
[00:25.18]I agree.
[00:26.00]Thank you, Smokin' Jojo Davis, for that sick intro with the Jerm float and bloat.
[00:30.62]Oh, come on.
[00:31.70]Nothing better than that.
[00:32.63]Nothing.
[00:33.85]Alright, let's get started, though.
[00:35.11]Let's see.
[00:37.54]You know, let's see, is, uh, Star or Shibby's server around right now?
[00:41.82]Usually they're, like, always full.
[00:44.72]You know what, whatever.
[00:46.12]Let's go to, uh... Uh, we could do Badwater on the Revenge.
[00:52.20]Let's do this.
[00:54.18]Oh!
[00:55.05]Great!
[00:55.67]Server not responding.
[00:56.91]Oh, great!
[00:58.39]This, hey, does this happen to anybody else?
[01:01.13]This seems to happen on, like, an hourly basis for me.
[01:04.95]Like, ready?
[01:05.35]I'm gonna try and go into any server.
[01:07.11]Oh, nope, can't go into that one.
[01:09.07]Nope, sorry.
[01:10.09]No, sorry, every server doesn't work.
[01:13.57]I was afraid this was gonna happen, so let's just wait a second and go look at my items.
[01:18.23]Oh, cool.
[01:18.99]Oh, I got paint.
[01:20.91]I don't remember that happening.
[01:22.66]Let's put it over in my, like, my dog shit junk folder.
[01:26.40]Whatever, let's go.
[01:28.78]I was afraid this was gonna happen.
[01:29.96]You know, this is, uh,
[01:31.89]Come on, let's get into... That ping kind of sucks.
[01:36.86]Yo!
[01:38.54]Gentleman Gummy, I'll accept it.
[01:39.92]Hold on, give me a second, brother.
[01:45.96]No, I guarantee none of these are going to work.
[01:50.00]Nope.
[01:51.28]Well, I'm going to cut, and we'll come back to this in about two seconds.
[01:56.16]Alright, so we're back.
[01:57.21]I got into a Dust Bowl server.
[01:59.27]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[01:59.93]It's a Gold Rush server.
[02:00.91]Duh.
[02:02.23]Okay, let's go with heavy.
[02:04.33]Going with Brass Beast, Gloves of Killing, Boxing.
[02:09.80]And we're doing the family business.
[02:11.04]I'm going to try something new here.
[02:12.28]Let's see.
[02:13.02]Let's do this.
[02:14.74]I was trying this earlier.
[02:15.76]I'm trying to get crits with this and then whip out the shotgun and, like, smoke people.
[02:19.48]You know what I mean?
[02:20.96]We'll see.
[02:21.58]We'll see.
[02:21.95]I don't know how many people are in here.
[02:23.85]Ah, there's quite a few.
[02:25.25]Looks like it just started too, so yeah.
[02:27.43]Alright, let's do it.
[02:30.84]Bye.
[02:31.24]There's a guy that's jumping right over.
[02:33.68]What was that?
[02:34.18]What the?
[02:34.48]Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:35.22]Hold on a second.
[02:36.36]What the fuck was that?
[02:39.46]What the hell was that?
[02:40.30]You guys saw that.
[02:41.54]What was that, like that blue plasma shit?
[02:44.86]I don't know about this, sir.
[02:47.56]I don't know about this.
[02:49.46]Did I pick like a Warcraft mod?
[02:51.58]Okay.
[02:52.64]Look at this guy's rocket launcher.
[02:55.63]What the... Yeah, goodbye.
[02:57.45]See you later.
[02:58.73]Not playing in this server.
[03:00.95]I'm gonna cut again.
[03:01.71]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[03:04.71]So it was just brought to my attention that... That was not like a server mod.
[03:09.24]That's a new item?
[03:10.62]Is that a... That's a new rocket launcher or something?
[03:12.66]I have no idea what's going on.
[03:15.22]Apparently they just updated the game, maybe, and I don't know.
[03:18.04]That was crazy.
[03:19.22]So anyways, there's people in here.
[03:20.74]I won't freak out the next... Hey!
[03:23.02]Hey!
[03:23.10]Hey!
[03:24.88]I... Okay, so what the hell is going on?
[03:27.55]That's a real item, huh?
[03:30.11]Alright, this is getting weird.
[03:32.31]I'm, like, really confused.
[03:33.83]I'm, like, freaking out.
[03:35.77]Apparently, that's a new rocket launcher, I guess?
[03:38.17]I don't know.
[03:39.44]That's weird.
[03:40.90]Well, anyways... I can't even, like, play it right now.
[03:46.16]I'm, like, freaking out.
[03:49.32]Alright, so... Is it... Hold on a second.
[03:53.84]No, you must have to get it.
[03:54.72]Uh, turn crits off.
[03:59.08]I don't know.
[03:59.68]I don't know, guys.
[04:00.76]I'm just as confused as you are.
[04:02.44]Because I'm recording this in real time.
[04:04.31]This is not... See, look, there it is.
[04:06.87]Wow.
[04:07.99]So, apparently, there's a pulse cannon in the game now for the soldier.
[04:13.09]I'm confused.
[04:14.15]I can't even, like, think.
[04:16.97]Let me just own somebody with this thing.
[04:18.47]Yeah, Brass Beast.
[04:19.49]Wow.
[04:21.87]Does it have new stats or something?
[04:23.86]I'm going to ask.
[04:24.46]I'm just going to be a turd and ask.
[04:27.06]Hey, does the new rocket launcher have stats, or is it just a new skin?
[04:30.64]Let's see if anybody, like... It has... Really?
[04:38.18]What the heck?
[04:38.54]What, did they do, like, an alien update?
[04:42.00]What does it do?
[04:48.92]It must just be... Wow.
[04:52.05]I have no idea.
[04:52.71]Well, anyways, this is Dust Bowl.
[04:56.41]I'm playing as the Brass Beast Heavy with the family business and the gloves of killing boxing.
[05:01.92]Can't talk.
[05:02.40]Hold on.
[05:02.82]Scout.
[05:05.42]See, I'm trying to do a new setup here where I... Oh, my God.
[05:10.02]Another Scout.
[05:12.98]Oh, get it off.
[05:15.04]So I'm trying this new setup where if I kill somebody with the gloves of killing boxing, then I'll be able to whip out the shotgun and get eight crits in a row with that thing.
[05:25.01]Because you can't really switch over to the minigun, especially the Brass Beast.
[05:27.61]It's a lot, a lot more difficult to do that.
[05:30.53]So I'm going to try this setup.
[05:31.97]The Brass Beast, I hate it.
[05:33.91]I'm really bad with it.
[05:35.03]But I want to get good with it and use this setup because I feel like nobody uses the damn shotgun because it sucks.
[05:40.29]But I'm going to find a use for it.
[05:41.31]Are you a spy?
[05:41.88]No.
[05:43.92]So there's a new shotgun.
[05:45.46]I mean, there's no shotgun.
[05:46.28]There's a new rocket launcher in the game that shoots pulse cannons, apparently.
[05:51.12]And this guy's got it.
[05:52.88]Look at that.
[05:53.38]I thought it was like a Warcraft mod.
[05:56.06]Everybody's got this thing.
[05:57.18]What the hell is going on?
[05:59.78]What?
[06:00.28]Screw this.
[06:02.03]This is insane.
[06:05.25]Get up here.
[06:05.91]Try and see like this whole group right here is going down.
[06:11.04]Maybe not.
[06:12.16]I'm just so confused.
[06:13.22]Okay, so it... Oh, there it is.
[06:15.66]There it is.
[06:16.24]Does not require ammo.
[06:17.36]This weapon can... Oh my god, I just had it.
[06:19.69]So it doesn't have... There's no ammo.
[06:22.69]Let's see if I can find somebody with it.
[06:23.89]Just look at the stats.
[06:24.97]Weapon does not require ammo.
[06:26.55]Can fire a charged shot that mini-crits players and disables... Oh my god.
[06:33.15]You gotta be shittin' me.
[06:35.31]It's a ranged sapper for the soldier.
[06:39.05]You gotta be shittin' me.
[06:41.34]When the hell did they... I am annoyed right now.
[06:46.03]That actually really, really just pissed me off.
[06:49.59]Why would they give a ranged sap to the soldier?
[06:52.23]I don't understand.
[06:53.03]I don't get it.
[06:56.05]I have no idea.
[06:56.67]I'm not going to pretend like I know what Valve is thinking.
[06:59.57]But that just seems odd.
[07:01.46]That seems very odd.
[07:02.34]Let me just kill like a ton of... Oh, yeah.
[07:05.26]Get owned.
[07:05.80]Get owned.
[07:07.52]Is an American medic around here?
[07:09.57]Wow, so it doesn't, there's no ammo.
[07:13.49]What kind of, did they add stuff for other classes?
[07:15.35]I'm going to ask.
[07:16.77]I'm going to be a noob.
[07:18.63]That's it, no, it's not a spy.
[07:22.10]Did they add stuff for other classes too, or is it just that thing for the soldier?
[07:31.14]Wow, so apparently they just added this insanely overpowered rocket launcher.
[07:35.70]For no reason, I guess.
[07:37.74]I need some health.
[07:40.41]Let's see if I can try and get this thing going.
[07:42.09]See if I can try and do what I was planning on doing.
[07:45.05]Kill somebody with the gloves and whip out the shotgun and just start killing people like crazy.
[07:49.59]Come on, let me sneak up here.
[07:51.54]Wow, that guy didn't even see me for a second.
[07:54.42]There we go.
[07:55.00]Here it comes, baby.
[07:58.48]There it is.
[07:59.30]There it is.
[08:01.31]See, that's what I wanted to do, but apparently this crazy new rocket launcher is insane.
[08:05.27]No random critical hits and this weapon deals reduced damage to buildings.
[08:08.27]Okay, so you can sap buildings, but it doesn't do good damage to buildings.
[08:14.12]I don't know.
[08:14.92]I don't get it.
[08:17.50]They just did the Uber update.
[08:19.62]What are they doing?
[08:21.68]We're going to do an Uber update with a pack for all the classes.
[08:25.66]Then we're just going to add a friggin' lightning gun for the soldier.
[08:29.19]Give me a break.
[08:30.73]Yeah, lure him out here.
[08:33.57]Yeah, lure him out here.
[08:35.19]Nice.
[08:36.51]So apparently, according to people in the chat, they're saying that this is not the end.
[08:42.48]I guess there's like two more rocket launchers or something that people are going to be able to get.
[08:47.74]That's weird.
[08:48.38]I don't know.
[08:48.70]I don't know what to think about this.
[08:50.30]Oh, there's a crit sticky.
[08:51.16]I'm dead.
[08:51.68]No, I guess not.
[08:55.32]Oh, nice shot.
[08:57.80]So, I don't know.
[08:59.28]This is all happening right now, so I don't know what to say besides this is insane.
[09:04.72]I just logged on, and I'm just like, yeah, I'll play some TF2 and see, like, you saw, I ran out of, I thought there was, like, a dickhead server with, like, you know, like, crazy mods on it.
[09:14.95]Wow.
[09:16.55]Insane.
[09:17.59]Whatever.
[09:17.93]I just don't know what to say.
[09:22.12]Oh, come on, let's see if I can get, no.
[09:23.76]Let's go.
[09:25.12]Let's go.
[09:27.63]Oh, let's go.
[09:28.15]Come on.
[09:28.91]Come on.
[09:29.17]I got one more shot and you're gone.
[09:30.93]One more shot and you're gone.
[09:33.17]Ah, but I'm going to die too, aren't I?
[09:36.14]Oh, no sandwich.
[09:37.74]No sandwich.
[09:38.36]Bad idea.
[09:39.00]But I'm trying to get used to this new setup because it could be pretty powerful.
[09:42.86]Oh, you don't even know where I am.
[09:43.94]You know what?
[09:44.55]Screw this.
[09:44.95]I'm going to try it again.
[09:48.35]Get somebody off guard like this guy.
[09:51.62]Oh, come on.
[09:53.34]Come on, Frank Oz.
[09:55.78]You, like, wonderful man with a wonderful voice.
[09:59.77]Those of you guys that don't know who Frank Oz is, he's the voice of Yoda, and he's a guy, one of the original Muppets and stuff like that.
[10:06.13]He's a pretty good guy.
[10:09.38]So, who do you think is going to get the next... Look, everybody's using it.
[10:14.76]So what are you supposed to do?
[10:15.80]Can you remove the sappers or something?
[10:18.32]Come on.
[10:18.68]Come on, kill that medic.
[10:21.18]Nice.
[10:22.20]So, it's a sapper.
[10:24.76]It disables buildings for four seconds.
[10:27.92]And it's part of a set?
[10:28.96]What's the other part of... God, I should really go to the blog and read up on this, but I'm not.
[10:34.43]I don't care.
[10:35.29]I'm doing terrible right now, too.
[10:37.41]Actually, maybe not.
[10:38.21]Fourteen and eight.
[10:40.22]I'm too concerned about this new update that I have not heard of until five seconds ago.
[10:47.69]So let's just go back down here and try this again.
[10:50.75]No pyros.
[10:54.11]The Brass Beast is... It's really good, but... Oh, God.
[10:59.63]And it fucking fills your screen.
[11:02.84]That item sucks.
[11:04.70]When somebody shoots you with it, it fills your screen with goo and you can't see anything.
[11:10.03]Oh, God.
[11:10.91]I really should have, like, done a little bit of practice and, you know, looked up some things before I came on to do a live commentary.
[11:18.23]Because there's a bunch of new, like, items that I've never seen or heard of before.
[11:26.53]You know, I'm going to have to go with a bread and butter class.
[11:30.25]The only thing you can do is if you're in a situation where you're getting owned by, like, new items and unfamiliar things, is just go with a bread and butter class.
[11:36.81]I'm going Spy with my regular loadout.
[11:39.70]So let's see what I can do here.
[11:41.72]Oh, by the way, it disables cloak, too.
[11:43.36]How funny would that be?
[11:44.20]Just kill me.
[11:44.90]Just kill me, you friggin' butthead.
[11:46.70]Alright, get out of my way.
[11:51.37]Get out of my way.
[12:00.31]Goodbye.
[12:01.89]Oh, this guy's laughing.
[12:02.75]He thinks he's funny.
[12:07.03]Well, nobody's... Ah, these guys saw me.
[12:09.62]Okay, let's get back here.
[12:12.92]That rocket launcher is insane, man.
[12:14.80]Oh, hopefully nobody heard that.
[12:19.10]Oh, well, we capped the point.
[12:20.44]Nice.
[12:21.44]Come on, back up.
[12:22.22]Back up right into this.
[12:24.34]Oh, no, not quite.
[12:25.16]I don't know why I did that.
[12:29.64]It just felt like it.
[12:31.48]But, yeah, I guess new stuff's gone the way.
[12:34.85]Maybe meet the Pyro Deep.
[12:38.81]Oh, whoa, Frapsalag, how are you?
[12:42.23]Oh, get off the point.
[12:43.25]Get those guys off the point.
[12:44.54]I'm on your team.
[12:48.06]Oh, and no cloak left.
[12:50.74]I don't know.
[12:51.14]I don't know about this.
[12:52.22]I don't know about this, guys.
[12:54.32]I don't know about this.
[12:59.86]What the hell are you guys doing?
[13:01.68]What are these people doing?
[13:05.03]My god.
[13:06.47]We got three medics doing absolutely nothing in the spawn.
[13:12.29]And somehow we're still gonna win.
[13:15.27]Well, we're not going to win.
[13:16.29]We might win.
[13:19.17]Oh god.
[13:20.36]If we do this with three medics just, you know, being idiots in the spawn, that'll be fine.
[13:25.26]Like, I'm just in regular spire right now and people aren't doing anything.
[13:28.70]In fact, it's gonna be wicked funny if I kill this guy.
[13:30.70]No, no, no, no.
[13:34.00]I'll be a sniper.
[13:36.88]Oh, bad place.
[13:37.90]Really bad place.
[13:38.96]I can't believe nobody saw that.
[13:40.82]Nah, this guy did.
[13:43.72]I'm sorry.
[13:44.36]My brain is just a mess right now trying to think about what else is going to happen in this update.
[13:50.21]Is it even on the blog?
[13:51.49]I haven't checked the Team Fortress 2 blog in a million years since the Uber update.
[13:57.87]Once this is over, you better believe, you bet your ass that's where I'm going immediately.
[14:01.89]What are you doing?
[14:03.38]That's a spy, probably.
[14:08.94]Goodbye.
[14:11.26]Oh, if you're wondering, I'm not going to use the... Oh, shit.
[14:15.14]Go ahead and kill me.
[14:16.06]I dare you.
[14:17.76]Oh, you had to be that guy and do that to me.
[14:20.58]Whatever.
[14:22.28]You had to be that guy and not just take the swing.
[14:27.15]Yeah, but you bet your bottom dollar that's where I'm going in a second.
[14:30.01]I'm done recording this.
[14:31.31]Which will probably be right after this round ends.
[14:36.62]Just because I need to know exactly what they're doing and what's going on.
[14:40.84]Fraps, cut the crap.
[14:44.52]Oh, you stole my thunder.
[14:51.98]Oh, I'm an idiot.
[14:54.31]I'm doing this is bad.
[14:56.91]This is like, 22 and 18 for me is like 2 and 90.
[15:02.52]I think we're still going to win, though.
[15:05.66]Ka-choo, ka-choo.
[15:08.50]But like I was saying before, we're about to win.
[15:14.12]How did I top score this server?
[15:17.04]How did I top score?
[15:19.46]Wow.
[15:20.40]I'm going to take that with a grain of salt because, yeah, I don't see how that happened, but cool.
[15:30.78]You'd think that they would test this in the beta and go, whoa, shit, maybe we shouldn't put that in the game.
[15:35.24]Is that a spy?
[15:37.62]Probably.
[15:38.08]No, it's not.
[15:39.93]What a waste of a Jurati.
[15:43.69]Ah!
[15:46.79]Oh my god.
[15:48.33]Oh my god.
[15:50.35]Do I even want to record for the next minute and a half?
[15:54.79]Because I'm sure you know what's going to happen.
[15:56.52]We're going to lose.
[15:58.94]You know what?
[16:00.04]No, I'm staying sniper.
[16:01.78]I'm going to stay Huntsman sniper on principle.
[16:07.73]Look at this mess.
[16:10.47]I can't believe I'm missing.
[16:11.55]I can't believe I'm... Wow, I'm on fire.
[16:21.15]Okay.
[16:23.66]We only got a minute left of this and then I'm going to stop it because I need to...
[16:28.59]This is not a good day for live commentary.
[16:30.81]But you know what?
[16:31.27]I'm uploaded anyways.
[16:32.68]Let me just get this one dude.
[16:33.86]You're dead.
[16:35.16]Let me just get this one guy.
[16:37.78]Oh, you give me... Wow.
[16:47.19]Fucking ridiculous.
[16:48.71]Pardon my French, but like really effing ridiculous.
[16:54.85]Still a sentry up there, too.
[16:56.91]Unbelievable.
[16:58.07]Unbelievable.
[17:02.89]Well, anyways, thanks for watching, guys.
[17:06.89]Hopefully you got to see the new item in all of its great, insane glory, because our team can't even get out of the spawn for the last, like, three rounds.
[17:19.27]So thanks for watching.
[17:21.70]Hopefully this gets sorted out in the next week or so and people aren't all getting locked in their spawns by a red team.
[17:29.85]So thanks again for watching and I'll see you guys later.
[17:33.49]Take care, man.
