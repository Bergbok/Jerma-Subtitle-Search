[00:08.46]Hey, what's happening, everybody?
[00:10.14]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Facecam Fortress 2 Monday's Edition.
[00:16.45]And I'm going to play as the Engineer.
[00:17.91]I'm kind of late right now.
[00:20.19]Oh, God, there's only five... Only five seconds and I've done... This is level one.
[00:24.23]This thing is going down immediately.
[00:26.71]But this is on Thunder Mountain.
[00:28.72]And hopefully... Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[00:33.66]Yes!
[00:34.50]At least it's level two.
[00:36.61]Using the JAG, the Frontier of Justice, and the pistol.
[00:41.69]Good to know.
[00:44.11]Spy.
[00:46.97]See if I can not... What is this guy doing?
[00:49.79]I love this guy's hat.
[00:50.61]This, like, chicken head thing.
[00:51.73]That's from the Adult Swim Pyromania.
[00:53.77]Woo!
[00:54.31]Update.
[00:57.34]Somebody come on out.
[00:59.74]Is anybody even... Okay, there's people in here, yes.
[01:02.24]Whoa!
[01:02.72]Whoa!
[01:03.20]Whoa!
[01:03.50]No ammo!
[01:03.96]No ammo!
[01:05.28]Oh!
[01:09.25]Oh, man, Scout.
[01:14.01]Why did you do that to me?
[01:17.13]Well, that's how you fall down.
[01:19.49]How is that sentry still up?
[01:21.03]I have no idea.
[01:24.73]Looks like it's going to stay up.
[01:26.90]Of course it is.
[01:29.24]Get this.
[01:32.50]Don't worry, it's going up.
[01:34.12]I got you.
[01:34.94]I got you, baby.
[01:36.28]Whoa, whoa, hold on here.
[01:39.95]What I just... Where is this guy?
[01:41.91]Is he back here?
[01:42.53]Oof.
[01:48.49]Anybody, anybody, anybody want to take a shot in the face?
[01:51.35]You are a spy, for sure, I bet.
[01:53.23]No, you are not a spy.
[01:56.71]I need to get that ammo.
[01:58.23]Oh my god, everyone just keeps picking up the ammo.
[02:02.17]Why must you torment me like this, team?
[02:04.36]It's alright, I'll get it now.
[02:10.54]Sentry!
[02:13.96]It's still up.
[02:15.27]What a miracle.
[02:17.15]I think it might be time for this thing to move.
[02:18.73]Yeah, come on.
[02:22.93]It might be time for this thing to move.
[02:26.27]Maybe not quite.
[02:27.11]Come on, get the... Where's the ammo?
[02:29.73]Where's the ammo?
[02:31.03]That's gonna be the title of this video.
[02:32.99]Where's the ammo?
[02:33.83]Let's give this thing a level two, at least.
[02:41.19]Spa around here.
[02:44.59]Speaking of spies, I better watch my butt.
[02:49.59]Level three.
[02:52.52]Oh, boy.
[02:53.06]You.
[02:54.36]You.
[02:57.94]Oh, you're going to do the little sneaky snake move, huh?
[03:01.10]Not going to work on me, baby.
[03:06.57]Well, I think at least we're winning.
[03:09.19]Technically, I guess.
[03:11.85]Come get some health, man.
[03:14.69]Vote for the next map.
[03:16.23]Oh, that one.
[03:19.79]I got a feeling this is going down.
[03:23.25]Yikes.
[03:25.40]That's what you do, and then you come over here, and you... Whoa, no you don't.
[03:29.18]Let's see if we can get out of here.
[03:30.22]Ready?
[03:34.64]Come on!
[03:35.73]Come on!
[03:36.95]Oh, nothing I can do there.
[03:38.23]Besides kill that... No!
[03:42.59]Oh!
[03:44.45]What?
[03:45.73]I just found a hat!
[03:48.30]Cool!
[03:50.20]You have just found a hat.
[03:52.37]In the comments section, somebody tell me, uh, what is the actual percentage of finding a hat?
[03:58.98]Is it 1%, 0.2%?
[04:02.16]Like, what's the actual percentage?
[04:03.62]I'm actually pretty curious to know what that is.
[04:12.12]Mmm, someone, someone, give me some, give me some ammo.
[04:14.20]Give me that.
[04:14.52]Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, this is sick.
[04:22.53]Level two!
[04:23.23]Going up!
[04:25.33]Oh.
[04:28.39]I just, like, pumped two shots at him, just for fun.
[04:34.63]Oh, don't wanna... I need to keep at least a little bit in case they try and take it out.
[04:40.30]Oh, he's hiding.
[04:42.80]Oh, he needs, like, one shot!
[04:46.02]Very good, very good.
[04:46.86]I need to get some more ammo.
[04:51.07]Come on, one of you bastards, give me some of your stuff.
[04:53.69]I think that was it.
[04:57.20]Save it!
[05:00.36]Oh, this is not good.
[05:01.06]This is not good.
[05:01.44]It's going to go down.
[05:04.38]No, it won't.
[05:04.86]No, it won't.
[05:06.00]Give me these two things.
[05:08.12]Oh, get away!
[05:08.71]Oh, no, you don't!
[05:16.35]Spy, you prickly little bastard.
[05:22.98]They are really getting mad about this century.
[05:25.28]I need a dispenser, but there's no time There's no time for that Whoa eight kills this thing is on a rampage Or do I dare do I dare put up a dispenser?
[05:40.01]I don't know oh I Don't know okay, whatever run oh
[05:51.49]Hey, you are not... Oh, I had to run away.
[05:56.28]I'm just putting a dispenser here.
[05:59.90]Oh!
[06:02.68]You gotta be... You've gotta be kidding me, man!
[06:04.96]No way!
[06:05.56]Oh, that's... Wow!
[06:11.02]I can't believe that just happened.
[06:13.60]What, did he have a dead ringer?
[06:14.62]He must have had a dead ringer.
[06:16.70]I had so many crits right there.
[06:19.76]Of course.
[06:22.22]Gosh.
[06:25.36]That's not the way I want to go.
[06:26.64]I want to go this way, right here.
[06:32.08]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[06:35.39]I feel like I was just on Scare Saturdays right there.
[06:38.07]That was terrifying.
[06:49.24]You are a spy.
[06:50.74]No, you're not.
[06:53.46]Gotta get a sentry up here.
[06:54.88]A good one.
[06:57.42]But yeah, like I was saying, I really felt like I was on Scare Saturdays right there.
[07:01.54]Spy just... Oh, that was so horrible.
[07:04.74]I would have gone on such a tear.
[07:07.17]Oh well.
[07:07.67]What can you do, right?
[07:10.97]Put it right here.
[07:15.03]They gotta come through here.
[07:15.95]And when I got my stuff all built up, they ain't gonna do anything.
[07:21.61]That guy just bumped into a spy, speaking of spies.
[07:27.64]Here it comes.
[07:28.12]Come on, get it to level two.
[07:30.20]No!
[07:31.50]What is that guy doing?
[07:33.68]Wow, okay.
[07:36.74]Kill him.
[07:37.26]Kill him.
[07:37.84]Thank you.
[07:38.36]No, no, no, no, no.
[07:42.58]Get out of here.
[07:43.50]Get out of here.
[07:46.87]He's probably not dead.
[07:49.45]I would be very surprised if that guy was actually dead.
[07:56.64]Maybe he is.
[07:57.40]Oh, his domination sound means he is, I think.
[08:00.60]Could be wrong on that one.
[08:06.42]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[08:09.08]Out of my way!
[08:09.86]Out of my way!
[08:17.41]Okay, oh yeah, by the way, what I'm doing right now, here's a little engineer tip.
[08:21.49]So if you get in a situ... Okay, so here's a... He didn't die.
[08:27.01]He's still right here, isn't he?
[08:30.17]No, he's not.
[08:31.23]So here's the engineer tip I was just going to give you.
[08:33.32]When you are building something... Oh, God!
[08:37.48]When you are... I can't even, like, get my tip off.
[08:39.52]There's so much chaos.
[08:40.94]When you are building something, right?
[08:42.56]What you want to do is you want to hit it, turn, hit it, turn, hit it, turn.
[08:45.60]You never lose any time.
[08:47.68]You just are finding any spies behind you.
[08:50.05]So just like this.
[08:50.71]Ready?
[08:51.33]Bang, swing, bang, swing, bang, bang.
[08:54.51]You don't lose any time, and it's a good way to watch behind you.
[08:57.93]Just a little engineer tip when your back is turned to the fight.
[09:02.88]I think we're going to win.
[09:04.64]I think we're actually going to win.
[09:09.45]Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[09:12.99]Here comes the last push.
[09:14.63]Oh, not really.
[09:15.05]There's a minute and a half left.
[09:16.47]There's still plenty of time.
[09:21.88]Oh, yeah.
[09:22.28]Thanks, Pyro.
[09:23.74]Hey, can you, like, repair my level 3 sentry, dude?
[09:26.46]Thanks.
[09:26.98]Oh, homewrecker Pyro.
[09:28.32]I love you.
[09:29.94]Engineer's best friend is a homewrecker Pyro.
[09:37.17]Oh, my nose is itchy.
[09:38.21]My nose is itchy.
[09:38.91]But I don't want to itch it.
[09:39.71]I don't want to itch it.
[09:40.77]This is too important.
[09:46.54]Oh, that guy is so dead.
[09:47.68]If he pokes his head around... No!
[09:51.10]Get... Oh, I've just got to shoot him.
[09:56.52]Oh, just let it die.
[09:57.99]He got... Oh...
[10:01.53]Oh, they're gonna win now.
[10:03.97]They're gonna cap it.
[10:05.59]Oh, get on there, get on there.
[10:08.27]If I didn't miss him with my shotgun, no.
[10:14.80]Just get back over there and do whatever you can.
[10:19.44]Just drop this right here.
[10:21.42]What?
[10:21.98]What just happened?
[10:23.66]What on earth just happened right there?
[10:26.84]Gotta get out here, gotta get out here.
[10:29.16]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[10:32.16]This is very important.
[10:34.44]This is so important.
[10:35.40]This has to go up right now.
[10:36.65]This is so important, so important, so important.
[10:41.05]No!
[10:41.57]No!
[10:42.13]Two Pyros!
[10:44.11]Two Pyros!
