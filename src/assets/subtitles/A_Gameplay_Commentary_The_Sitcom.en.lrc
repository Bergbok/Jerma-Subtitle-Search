[00:08.80]Jerma985 is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
[00:20.49]Okay, let me get things all settled here.
[00:22.93]Got my microphone, I got everything set, got the gameplay ready to record.
[00:26.07]Alright, let's do it.
[00:29.75]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:31.21]Jerma... Oh, making a commentary?
[00:38.50]Well, I was trying to until I was rudely interrupted.
[00:42.70]No, but seriously, man, you look stressed.
[00:47.46]What's, uh, what's wrong?
[00:49.36]Ah, yeah, I just got back from the grocery store.
[00:51.10]The lines were really long, but I managed to pick up some fruits and vegetables on the way home.
[00:56.02]Oh, I'm gonna be making some of my famous chicken pot pie.
[01:00.96]Oh, boy.
[01:01.74]Looks like we're doing takeout again tonight.
[01:07.28]Why wasn't I invited to the shindig?
[01:15.21]Spoon, I didn't know you were coming over.
[01:17.69]God, so many interruptions.
[01:19.27]I'm never going to get this commentary.
[01:20.83]Guys, this isn't part of the video right now.
[01:23.33]I just got a phone call.
[01:25.98]Everybody I've ever met in my life is in the hospital right now.
[01:28.86]I have to go.
[01:31.94]Pizza?
[01:32.80]I didn't think we were going to get pizza.
[01:34.14]Hang on, I'll be right back.
[01:34.98]I'm going to get my wallet.
[01:41.43]Let's do this commentary now.
[01:42.47]I can sit down.
[01:43.03]I can actually do this freaking thing.
[01:44.72]I don't have to keep getting interrupted by people.
[01:46.78]Hey, motherfucker.
[01:49.66]It's me, Grandpa.
[01:54.88]What are you doing?
[01:56.38]I'm working on a commentary.
[01:57.62]Oh, yeah.
[01:58.30]Working on a commentary.
[01:59.42]Look at me.
[01:59.94]My name is Jabba.
[02:01.18]Working on a commentary.
[02:02.26]Look at how smart I am.
[02:05.99]Yeah, I'm trying to get it done, so I would appreciate it if you just took off for a little while, Grandpa.
[02:12.18]That's okay.
[02:12.78]I'll leave you to your work.
[02:17.22]I'll just leave you to your work.
[02:18.40]I'm going to make sure... Don't worry.
[02:22.78]Tonight, can you hear me talk?
[02:24.62]I didn't even say anything funny.
[02:26.01]Shut the fuck up.
[02:28.69]I forgot my line.
[02:29.69]They really just screwed me over right there.
[02:31.93]You know, thank you.
[02:33.25]Thank you, studio audience.
[02:34.75]You really fucked it all up for me.
[02:38.09]Yeah, you know what that is?
[02:39.13]That's the double middle finger.
[02:40.75]You can laugh all you want.
[02:42.05]I don't give a shit.
[02:43.35]I'm out of here.
[02:44.91]All right, well, see you later.
[02:46.99]Can I finally get this thing done for Pete's sake?
[02:49.73]Here we go.
[02:51.35]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[02:53.17]Jermock here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[02:57.34]And tonight, I'm going to be playing as the Soldier with the next...
