[00:08.95]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.99]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:15.67]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Sniper in a stipulation match.
[00:20.72]Now, before I get into this, I want to talk about, uh, it's summertime right now, and the pollen in the air is making my voice and throat and nose all scratchy and screwy-louy, so I do apologize if in this video it sounds a little raspy, but hopefully this damn pollen goes away so I can breathe again.
[00:38.37]Anyways, this is a stipulation match.
[00:42.09]The series where I take a certain class and a certain loadout, and I have to follow a very very strict set of rules and guidelines during the entire video.
[00:50.28]Now this video, playing as the sniper, I have to use the sniper rifle and the Jurati only.
[00:56.74]Now here's the big kicker, that doesn't sound so bad, now does it?
[00:59.80]The big stipulation here is I can only no-scope with this sniper rifle.
[01:04.33]Now, this was requested a very, very long time ago, back when I first started the stipulation series to begin with, and I've never been able to get a gameplay.
[01:11.99]It has taken me so long to get this.
[01:14.11]It is very, very difficult, and I suggest you try it out.
[01:17.35]If you've never tried something like this before, jump into a server and just try to do this, throw the Jurati on somebody and no-scope.
[01:24.33]It is freaking hard.
[01:26.79]Specifically, because when you throw the Jurati on somebody and you no-scope them... Well, you know, let's start from the beginning here.
[01:32.63]When you no-scope somebody in general, it's only going to do about 50 damage.
[01:37.62]So when you throw the Jurati on somebody, you increase that number to about 65 to 72.
[01:44.12]which really isn't that big of an increase.
[01:46.08]If you look at the damage spread and the random number generation in this game, it only ends up being about 20 extra damage.
[01:52.77]So it turns out, you're better off not using the Jurati to begin with, if you're going to do this stipulation, of course.
[01:59.05]Because let's think of it like this.
[02:00.45]When you throw the Jurati, it takes about...
[02:02.96]three seconds for you to throw the Jurati, get your weapon back up ready to shoot.
[02:07.36]So after that, when you shoot somebody, let's say you connect with someone, it does 68 damage.
[02:12.36]That's fantastic.
[02:13.84]But in the time it takes to pull out the rifle after throwing out the Jurati, you could have potentially already no-scoped two or three times and done more damage than that one Jurati shot.
[02:24.21]So with that out of the way, which that kind of goes over the whole process of how this setup works, I told you it's very, very difficult.
[02:31.24]This is so hard to do this.
[02:33.26]I only got maybe two or three kills in a row before I would get killed by somebody.
[02:37.68]It's just super, super hard.
[02:39.46]And I came to the conclusion while I was doing this,
[02:42.49]I'm pretty much a gimped scout.
[02:44.69]And here's my explanation for that.
[02:46.85]So I'm using a hip-firing hitscan weapon.
[02:49.91]The only other classes that have hitscan weapons are the soldier, the scout, and the engineer.
[02:55.48]Now, I'm not going to really count the pistol that much, or really any of the melee items, because those are technically hitscan as well.
[03:01.82]I'm just talking primary or secondary.
[03:04.76]So I have a scattergun as the sniper, except it shoots a whole lot slower, it does a hell of a lot less damage, and it only shoots one pellet.
[03:15.31]And I run slower.
[03:16.67]I don't run as fast as a scout either.
[03:18.43]So when you play this setup as the sniper, essentially you're just taking the scout, clubbing him in the head with a bowling pin, and then letting him out of spawn and saying, okay, go kill the red team.
[03:28.25]And he's like, Joey, what time is it?
[03:32.32]And it really is no surprise that when you go up against any other class, really any other class, it is very hard to kill them.
[03:39.19]And they are going to get you probably 80% of the time.
[03:42.61]But that does not mean this is not fun, and should not be tried at least a couple of times.
[03:47.49]And it took me, like I said, a while before I got this down, before I got the actual strategy down.
[03:52.63]But it is really cool when you kill one or two people like that.
[03:55.75]It's very interesting, makes you feel good.
[03:58.95]So here are just a couple of examples of how I got these kills that you're seeing.
[04:02.88]So this soldier hits me with a rocket.
[04:04.34]I know for a fact he's coming in the room, and sure enough, there he is, right in his face.
[04:08.30]If I had thrown the Jurati at him when he came into the room, I probably would have died.
[04:13.49]He turns that corner and shoots one rocket at me.
[04:16.49]I will explode all over the walls, all over all the nice paintings in that room.
[04:20.67]There are no paintings in that room, but you get the idea.
[04:23.14]I would have instantly died.
[04:25.34]So killing that scout right there is a pretty good example of knowing when somebody is trying to get health.
[04:30.95]Because as you saw, he was jumping all over the place, trying to get over me.
[04:34.87]And I was certain if I put one bullet into him, I would have killed him.
[04:38.27]And those two examples, no Jurati was thrown at all.
[04:42.12]And that, of course, goes back to my previous point of me not using the Jurati and how it's a little easier to not throw the Jurati.
[04:49.01]So while this commentary comes to a close, I just want to say thank you, of course, for watching.
[04:53.01]I really do appreciate it.
[04:54.46]And I will see you guys all next time.
[04:55.90]More stipulations are in the works.
[04:58.18]I think Pyro is going to be the next one.
[05:00.22]We will see.
[05:01.54]So peace, guys.
[05:02.46]I'll see you all soon.
[05:03.78]And take care, everybody.
