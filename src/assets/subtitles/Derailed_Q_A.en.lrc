[00:03.65]So I just want to put on undergarments, right?
[00:06.49]I picked up a pair.
[00:07.55]I have a lot of just black underwear, right?
[00:13.39]I'm putting on the underwear, and I pick up a pair of black underwear, and I get into it, and it's ripped.
[00:20.20]It's so tight.
[00:20.80]What's going on?
[00:21.78]And I was like, this doesn't feel right on me.
[00:23.62]It was a pair of Kim's underwear.
[00:26.56]I just ruined them.
[00:27.94]I just put them on, and I was like, this doesn't feel right.
[00:29.72]This is weird.
[00:34.83]It was like a cartoon, like Jerry Lewis putting on underwear.
[00:42.29]Okay.
[00:43.40]What were we doing?
[00:44.04]What was I doing?
[00:46.68]Oh, I'm going to save this game.

[05:11.59]When are you gonna do birdwatching?
[05:15.47]Ah, that's a good question.
[05:16.82]I have no idea.
[05:22.25]I have absolutely no idea.
[05:24.89]I want to do the bird watching stream, but I want it to be good.
[05:29.81]here's my fear with a bird watching stream I'm out there and I got binoculars and you guys got binoculars you guys have your own binoculars for chat so you can see too you know so I can like put you in the right spot I want there to be a camera that's binoculars in the camera so I can when I look at it you'll see it too but the problem with that is what if no birds show up and it's just me sitting under like a tree like four or five hours
[05:58.40]Did I grow a unibrow?
[06:01.49]No, I think it's just the... I think it's just... Did I?
[06:05.01]I usually... Kim gets in there and she plucks it for me.
[06:10.47]Is it there?
[06:10.81]Doesn't look like it.
[06:13.97]Maybe it's like the bitrate.
[06:20.42]It's been a while, though.
[06:24.87]No, it feels pretty bare in there.
[06:27.81]Maybe like right here it's a little thick.
[06:30.57]It could use a little cleaning.
[06:33.77]You're a mess.
[06:42.71]Am I?
[06:46.29]Actually, there's a... Okay, hold on.
[06:47.53]Here's the thing.
[06:48.51]When I go like this, am I?
[06:52.03]One or two frames in there make me look like shit.
[06:55.80]That's the thing.
[06:58.20]You could pull... Even if I look at you like this and I'm talking very normally and I look fairly normal, one of these frames is gonna look wicked fucked up.
[07:09.71]And which one is it?
[07:10.33]I don't know.
[07:14.35]Did somebody do it?
[07:15.51]Let's do... I want to do this theory.
[07:18.42]Okay, I'm going to say a sentence, and I want somebody to just take a screenshot of me in the middle of talking.
[07:23.24]And I guarantee you my eyes are going this way, my nose is going like this, and my mouth is like this.
[07:29.79]Are you ready?
[07:31.39]Hey, welcome to the channel.
[07:32.57]My name is Jerma985.
[07:33.77]I hope you're joining us for some cool adventures and some great video gaming.
[07:38.65]Join us today.
[07:39.73]Go ahead, let's see it right now.
[07:41.69]Somebody get it.
[07:48.37]I want you to pull one, just any frame from there.
[08:14.62]I can't click that.
[08:16.29]I can't- I'm not showing that.
[08:17.69]I'm not showing that.
[08:18.61]I'm not gonna show it.
[08:19.33]I'm not showing it.
[08:34.96]Why?
[08:36.60]Why did you make this?
[08:43.46]Okay, this- somebody's got one?
[08:48.81]I'm not showing that.
[08:50.29]It's... Okay, look it.
[08:57.18]Look at how fucked up I look.
[08:59.88]This is just a random frame.
[09:04.51]Let's see.
[09:04.87]I want to see if I can match how I look in these weird screenshots that you take in the middle of me talking.
[09:17.98]Doesn't something look strange?
[09:19.10]Something looks off.
[09:32.47]Normal?
[09:32.91]My eyes look too big.
[09:39.54]All of a sudden, the one on the right just goes, just jumps at the screen.
[09:42.52]Oh, that'd be awesome.
[09:49.74]It's the real one.
[09:54.22]Yeah, perfect.
[09:55.30]So here we go.
[09:56.44]I need to show you guys this because this is so important.
[09:59.80]When people show a funny picture that I did, look at how funny and weird he looks.
[10:05.74]Look at this like crazy streamer.
[10:07.46]He's crazed.
[10:09.60]No, you just take a frame from in the middle of a normal sentence.
[10:14.44]And I look insane.
[10:20.05]You have gray hair.
[10:21.13]I don't have gray.
[10:21.69]It's the light above there.
[10:29.44]I'm cheese to meet you.
[10:30.46]No, I don't.
[10:31.72]Yeah, here's another one.
[10:34.71]This one's the worst.
[10:35.35]This is awful.
[10:47.23]This guy, I used to do this.
[10:50.25]I used to do this shit for a living.
[10:52.59]This is every single photo of people at the wedding that are not the bride or the groom that are in focus.
[11:01.88]This is every single other image.
[11:06.48]Whoever is not directly in focus, you're this guy.
[11:11.82]And you might just be eating.
[11:16.48]He made money from this.
[11:18.56]Yes, I did.
[11:19.36]I did wedding shit.
[11:22.36]Because that was the job that I could do.
[11:25.87]I knew how to edit.
[11:26.71]I knew how to film.
[11:27.91]I knew how to do these things.
[11:30.13]So what can I do?
[11:31.55]I'm going to make some cash.
[11:34.61]That's not new lore.
[11:36.45]That's been known since like 2012.
[11:37.41]Chuck left.
[11:37.67]It's okay.
[11:48.62]I feel like this is not real.
[11:51.58]Is- Okay, here's the- Let's play a game.
[11:53.90]Is this a real image or not?
[11:56.24]I don't think this one is.
[11:59.27]I do not believe this is a real screenshot from the stream.
[12:05.61]No, it's not.
[12:06.03]You can tell.
[12:06.31]Look at the nose.
[12:08.78]It's not real?
[12:09.30]Because look at the nose and look- Yeah.
[12:11.10]This is not real.
[12:12.36]Sorry.
[12:13.24]Incorrect.
[12:16.54]Rotate.
[12:31.79]Not real.
[12:33.75]Not real.
[12:34.21]You can tell by the tip of the nose and you can tell by the eyes.
[12:37.35]Not a real image.
[12:38.55]My eyes are too close together in this one.
[12:41.53]See?
[12:47.09]Incorrect.
[12:49.67]Coming up next on, is this a real screenshot from the stream?
[12:55.32]This one is.
[12:58.31]Okay.
[12:59.33]I'm gonna- my vote on this one is, uh, is yes.
[13:05.45]This is a yes from me, I think.
[13:06.75]I think- I believe this is probably a real image.
[13:08.63]Maybe not.
[13:17.96]Yeah, it's real.
[13:18.40]Look- look- you see the- is there space here?
[13:19.74]Okay.
[13:22.76]They were smart enough, if they doctored it, to put that in.
[13:26.10]You're a dinosaur.
[13:32.85]I don't know though.
[13:33.43]This looks a little fat down here.
[13:35.91]Like right here.
[13:36.47]This looks... I don't know.
[13:44.46]I don't think that's real.
[13:45.14]Maybe it's not.
[13:47.42]I'm going to vote real though.
[13:48.32]I feel like this is real.
[13:51.04]It's real.
[13:51.48]Okay.
[13:51.82]Got it.
[13:52.06]Nice raptor tooth.
[13:57.53]Hey.
[13:57.65]Hey.
[13:57.97]Let's see your teeth.
[14:05.15]This one's also real.
[14:07.77]Let's see.
[14:08.21]This one's also real.
[14:14.54]Yeah.
[14:21.07]That's a real image.
[14:26.62]What else we got?
[14:28.12]Let's see, this one.
[14:29.38]This one, I'm actually not sure about this one.
[14:32.38]Is this one a real image or not?
[14:33.94]Let's see, I wonder.
[14:37.64]Well... It's hard to tell.
[14:43.84]Because, like, down here is the way that it is, and it seems pretty similar.
[14:54.35]Yeah, it's real.
[14:55.29]I think this one's probably real.
[15:00.40]Pretty close.
[15:01.79]This one's tough though, I don't know.
[15:08.13]The left one's the fake one.
[15:12.95]I know this is real.
[15:13.65]You know how I know this is real?
[15:17.67]I can tell you immediately.
[15:19.37]Because this is the exact face that I make in that Jermavlog thumbnail.
[15:25.05]Where I'm going like that.
[15:26.61]It's the same exact face.
[15:28.13]Somebody want to get it?
[15:28.83]Because we can verify the image.
[15:30.45]It's like handwriting.
[15:32.17]Like, the way that your mouth moves when you talk is your handwriting.
[15:36.77]It's handwriting.
[15:37.85]Like, you can be identified.
[15:41.43]That's not a soy face, okay?
[15:45.52]That's me talking.
[15:47.64]So when I just said the A in talking, talking, go ahead.
[15:52.38]Ready?
[15:52.90]When I say the A in talking, talking, sure.
[15:56.73]Let's see what it looks like.
[16:00.25]Show it to me.
[16:00.91]Let's see.
[16:01.29]Fake.
[16:19.49]Nice gnome, you got me.
[16:22.61]That's not even close, dude.
[16:24.16]Alright, it needs a little work right here, but I'm working on it.
[16:33.70]Where's the one to be talking?
[16:37.93]It's not this one.
[16:38.79]Alright, I'm not, I can't, I don't want to show this on stream.
[16:45.75]It's this one.
[17:06.65]Give me the real one please.
[17:26.89]People that are coming in and they say, somebody just said, this is so stupid.
[17:29.83]I can't wait to watch the VOD.
[17:31.11]You have no idea what happened during this stream.
[17:33.91]Could you, like, if you explain this to somebody, would you think they would even believe you?
[17:42.87]I don't, I don't think I would believe somebody if they said this.
[17:51.32]That's not even me.
[17:52.60]You're not even linking me pictures of me.
[18:00.27]I gotta get this off my computer.
[18:01.73]I gotta get this image off my fucking computer and off my hard drive.
[18:05.77]And then I have to fucking... Then I have to get a new hard drive.
[18:11.25]Okay, where is this picture?
[18:14.59]What's wrong with this one?
[18:18.89]Wasn't on fucking purpose, I swear to God.
[18:20.93]I swear to God.
[18:21.59]I swear to God.
[18:29.81]Why are you doing this?
[18:32.64]What file is it?
[18:33.64]This is real, of course.
[18:57.68]I'm still being hosted.
[18:59.02]Oh shit.
[19:03.06]Oh no.
[19:04.04]No, no.
[19:04.36]We have to abort immediately.
[19:05.78]This is an immediate, this is an immediate abort scenario.
[19:11.84]Am I being hosted still?
[19:28.55]Okay, this one's like funny, but this is not even, this is not even the same stream.
[19:35.01]This is a different stream.
[19:44.49]This is a different, this is a different place.
[19:55.32]Is this a pog?
[19:56.48]No, this is not a pog.
[20:02.69]I know there's noise coming off of this, though.
[20:05.53]You wanna know the noise coming off of this?
[20:07.69]This is the sound that this is making.
[20:20.91]That's what that emotion is.
[20:28.38]That's not going like,
[20:30.85]Like, oh, no, no, that's very, very energetic.
[20:34.78]Ton of energy behind it.
[20:35.64]All right, what else you got?
[20:37.50]Uh, this is too big.
[20:55.73]While Chuck E. Cheese is offline, check out...
[21:06.09]That's just a before and after photo.
[21:09.83]Alright, that's just, that's one of those, like, this is what happens when you do drugs for a long time.
[21:20.35]The only thing it's missing, it's missing, like, four or five other pictures that end up here.
[21:25.79]Maybe you shouldn't watch this stream.
[21:33.47]Alright, what else you got?
[21:42.31]All right, any more questions?
[21:43.59]Anybody got any questions?
[21:46.25]Anybody have anything, any questions to ask?
[21:50.56]Oh, okay, there's a shitload of people here.
[21:52.00]Let's talk about this.
[21:52.60]This is actually really important stuff.
[21:54.68]September 13th at 3 p.m.
[21:58.08]Pacific is FTK.
[22:00.44]That's when it's coming back.
[22:02.32]You only need to be subscribed to the channel.
[22:04.88]No more of that two, three month active bullshit.
[22:08.26]It's just not going to work.
[22:09.08]I wasn't around for like months.
[22:10.68]So I cannot expect people to sub through my absence.
[22:13.56]So September 13th, put it on your calendar at 3 p.m.
[22:17.01]Pacific.
[22:17.65]Why is it happening so much later?
[22:19.79]Now I'm noticing the unibrow.
[22:21.63]Now I'm noticing it.
[22:23.89]I see what you mean.
[22:29.78]But it's not there.
[22:32.87]It's really not there though.
[22:33.91]It's like something to do with how this shadow is going.
[22:38.64]What the fuck happened?
[22:43.58]Chuck E. Cheese did something?
[22:44.72]What happened?
[22:45.44]We're talking about Chuck E. Cheese.
[22:48.08]No, FTK, FTK, you got it, got it, got it, yeah.
[22:50.98]Alright, so, it's not gonna be what you expect this time.
[22:54.49]It's gonna be a lot different.
[22:56.09]It's gonna be a 100% reimagined game.
[22:59.95]It's not gonna be just shoot arrows at him until he fucking gets drunk and swears.
[23:04.96]No.
[23:06.88]He's blitzed.
[23:14.47]I'm not.
[23:14.87]100 what?
[23:17.69]What shoe size do you wear? 10.
[23:26.47]And I bought seven and a half sandals.
[23:28.59]And I just squeezed into them.
[23:29.85]And Kim laughs.
[23:32.07]Oh, Kim laughed at something.
[23:33.65]Listen to this.
[23:34.33]I can't show this image, but it was fucking funny.
[23:36.31]She took a picture with her phone.
[23:38.06]With my phone.
[23:39.52]So I was in the bathroom for a really long time yesterday.
[23:42.36]And I was just hanging out in there.
[23:44.02]I was on the phone.
[23:45.26]And after you go... I don't know.
[23:48.06]I do this all the time.
[23:49.07]After I'm done using the bathroom, I just hang out in there.
[23:53.67]Even when I'm done, like, clean.
[23:55.19]We're talking clean and done completely.
[23:57.79]I just... I'm just... I'm in here.
[24:01.14]I'm on the phone still for, like, another maybe... At least five to ten minutes.
[24:04.74]Sometimes a little bit more.
[24:05.52]Sometimes less.
[24:06.86]So I get out of the bathroom.
[24:07.80]I've been in there for about 30 minutes.
[24:09.88]And Kim is laughing her ass off at me.
[24:12.19]She's just cracking up.
[24:13.13]I'm like, what is so funny?
[24:13.89]What are you doing?
[24:14.37]And she just... She was dying laughing.
[24:15.73]I could not get it out of her.
[24:17.07]I'm just like, what?
[24:17.95]Why are you laughing?
[24:19.90]And she's like, just wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:21.40]And she took a, she's like, please turn around.
[24:23.56]And she took a photo.
[24:25.00]By the way, I'm just, I'm in my underwear, right?
[24:26.88]She took a photo and the photo is of my backside.
[24:31.73]There is a toilet seat that is a perfect toilet seat line red under my, like on my legs.
[24:41.51]It's a big, perfect toilet seat that's indented into my legs.
[24:51.08]And it was fucked.
[24:53.16]It was so stupid.
[24:54.00]It was funny, though.
[25:00.06]That's why my back is fucked up?
[25:02.38]No, it's not.
[25:05.80]It has a toilet scar.
[25:10.76]Okay, you know how people, when they play games a lot, they get this?
[25:14.14]Like the little redness here with the mouse and the keyboard?
[25:17.02]I guarantee you I have a red ass.
[25:19.26]I guarantee it.
[25:21.37]I guarantee it.
[25:23.19]I have like an indented, like inflamed red, like ass and legs because of the toilet seat.
[25:30.31]I have like the gamer sore here, whatever it's called, on my ass.
[25:34.96]Because I spend a lot of time on the toilet like that.
[25:41.70]Prove it.
[25:43.66]Okay.
[25:45.02]They're just gonna have to take my word for it.
[25:48.69]Get this off the fucking screen.
[25:53.92]I don't want you to see the shelf, because there's always spoilers.
[26:03.93]Turn the cam off.
[26:05.87]When the cam turns off, the stream's turning off.
[26:07.33]This got destroyed.
[26:09.63]Started off playing a game.
[26:10.63]Chuck E. Cheese became my new best friend.
[26:12.29]This has been weird, but cool.
[26:16.46]It's been fun.
[26:19.70]Raw it.
[26:23.90]But he hates you now.
[26:27.62]You missed a Chuck E. Cheese comment.
[27:06.71]Okay.
[27:09.75]Okay.
[27:10.11]Anybody have any more questions?
[27:13.07]But no.
[27:14.05]Oh, FTK.
[27:14.71]FTK.
[27:15.29]Shit.
[27:15.67]Alright.
[27:16.09]FTK.
[27:17.27]So FTK, back the last time we did it, which is like four months ago now, this is going to be completely different.
[27:24.44]It was kind of haphazardly organized.
[27:27.26]It wasn't a good setup.
[27:29.04]The servers got hammered.
[27:30.88]This time, this time, it's going to be completely different.
[27:34.96]We're going to have like a ton.
[27:36.02]There's going to be like seven or eight servers linked together to make this happen.
[27:40.18]There's going to be people.
[27:41.26]You don't have to be subbed for more than two or three months.
[27:43.26]Just active subscription.
[27:45.22]That's it.
[27:46.89]There's going to be a period about three or four days before the stream happens where we're going to start to try to bring in like whitelist people and get them whitelisted so we don't have the server get dumped with thousands of connections at the exact same time.
[28:03.29]This is what Jerma plans when he's on the toilet.
[28:05.01]Yeah, no, it is.
[28:05.61]You're right.
[28:06.76]You have that exactly right.
[28:09.29]Explain FTK.
[28:10.59]Well, it was called Fuck the King, and the goal was I was gonna get as many people as I possibly could to get into a Minecraft server, but the goal was just whoever could just try to kill me.
[28:18.63]I had god armor on, and they were all children.
[28:21.56]They were all babies, and they would- they would have tried to kill me, like three or four hundred of them.
[28:25.74]Uh, but then it did- that didn't happen.
[28:27.76]Uh, I ended up dying like three times.
[28:30.96]Uh, the server went down like ten times.
[28:33.89]And... Um, that's all I remember.
[28:37.76]I remember walking around singing and there's like just 60 people standing around me and just looking at me.
[28:45.07]It's changed.
[28:46.23]This is a full three to five hour experience.
[28:49.61]It's a full game.
[28:51.13]This is a game.
[28:52.51]This is not just like a, okay, we're in.
[28:55.71]Fucking just walk over there and just try to catch him, I guess.
[28:58.86]No, there's a full game.
[29:01.82]It's September 13th at 3 p.m.
[29:04.96]Pacific.
[29:09.00]The server's also going to stay up, by the way.
[29:10.60]So when this is all done, the server stays up for at least a month so people can play it that didn't get to play in the server that's really important.
[29:22.31]I will crush it.
[29:25.47]Please don't.
[29:28.27]Permadeath is back, but it's changed a little bit.
[29:30.79]You don't get banned from the server.
[29:33.05]You get kicked back to one of these hub cities that they're going to have.
[29:35.93]They're going to have multiple servers that are going to just be hub places for you to re-queue to get back into the game.
[29:41.93]So you're not banned, but you drop to the back of the queue.
[29:45.73]We want to try to cycle in as many people as possible, and oh gosh darn it, let me tell you, there's going to be quite a few people being cycled out.
[29:53.12]You ain't gonna live.
[29:54.82]I can assure you that.
[29:56.86]So, like, those of you that are like, yeah, I'm gonna fucking live the whole time.
[30:00.56]I hope so.
[30:01.58]Good luck.
[30:03.52]Good luck.
[30:09.34]Make the germa as tiny sign again.
[30:13.91]Put that person in the back of the queue.
[30:17.64]You're going to Jerma hell.
[30:19.56]It is kind of like a purgatory thing.
[30:21.94]Because you don't get booted out of the client or anything.
[30:24.14]Or out of the server.
[30:24.99]You go back to one of the other queue servers.
[30:28.37]So.
[30:30.31]How do you get in the queue?
[30:31.09]You just connect.
[30:32.51]You just connect.
[30:34.17]And then you get to.
[30:34.81]You're going to be able to.
[30:35.45]You're going to do a little thing.
[30:36.27]There's going to be a slash like authenticate thing.
[30:38.80]Where it just checks to see if you're a sub.
[30:41.74]And apparently it works very, very well.
[30:43.90]They've been testing it for a little while.
[30:45.36]All it does is just, is this person subbed to Jerma985 actively right now?
[30:51.08]If the answer is yes, then you can go in.
[30:53.20]If the answer is no, hey, hold on, if the answer is no, you can still hang out in this hub server.
[30:59.97]Speaking is difficult when you do it for a long time in a row.
[31:02.67]It's been about four hours of speaking in a row.
[31:09.56]And you'll die.
[31:10.26]No, you can hang out in the hub city.
[31:11.68]You can be in the hub cities.
[31:14.12]You just can't join the FTK game.
[31:16.40]Is there a hub world so people can queue to play?
[31:23.41]I actually don't know exactly how the hub world, like the queue world, is going to work.
[31:27.97]But obviously over the next three or four days I'll get some more details on it.
[31:32.77]and like not even like three or four days before the stream happens there's gonna be a lot of testing on this as well and I'll be in the discord asking all kinds of questions for people if they want to try to jump in and help so that's a curse link where oh that was real
[32:01.75]I was like, holy shit, when did I show that much underwear on stream?
[32:05.85]I've never shown underwear like that on stream.
[32:11.69]I did ruin a pair of Kim's underwear, though.
[32:13.50]I just put them on because I was freaking out, and they just didn't fit right, and I just ripped through them.
[32:20.32]I didn't mean to wear them.
[32:21.74]I have black underwear.
[32:23.34]She has black underwear.
[32:24.96]This is a really fucking hard thing to explain.
[32:27.14]This is a really weird thing to be hosted by a family restaurant that serves pizza and has arcade games.
[32:34.71]I'm talking about tearing through my girl's, like, friend's underwear while I put it on.
[32:42.23]I'm not sure, like, anybody should be here right now.
[32:44.49]You know, if you think that, I don't think anyone should be watching this.
[32:49.49]Forget about, like, a family restaurant.
[32:58.08]Do a podcast.
[33:01.25]you want me to talk about I'll do it right now give me a talk give me a topic and I'll talk about it runescape pretty cool you can hey how about that latest runescape update 2.4.2 talk about the stock market no we don't talk about the stock market anymore
[33:32.93]Thought after Beyond Meat.
[33:34.37]I don't talk about the stock market anymore since Beyond Meat.
[33:38.17]Sorry.
[33:41.94]I got burned on Beyond Meat real bad.
[33:43.74]Yeah.
[33:44.40]Yeah.
[33:45.30]I was like, there's no way this is like a fucking $300 a share company.
[33:48.10]This is like more than Apple.
[33:49.76]I was like, this is coming fucking way down.
[33:52.16]Like, there's no way.
[33:52.64]It's a fucking... Look, they're good.
[33:54.40]I like them, but it's like... It's as expensive as like Apple.
[33:57.88]I was like, there's no way.
[34:00.65]Whatever.
[34:01.53]You win some, you fucking lose some, you lose most of them.
[34:03.59]You lose almost all of them.
[34:04.51]You lose almost all except for maybe one.
[34:07.03]Ever.
[34:08.67]While doing that.
[34:09.31]Okay.
[34:10.15]So.
[34:12.49]How much did you lose?
[34:13.21]Not enough to be upset about.
[34:15.62]But enough to be irritated.
[34:23.02]What modulator voice modulation do I use?
[34:25.48]Well, it is a GoXLR.
[34:28.66]And it actually works pretty well.
[34:31.97]it seems to be very cool it's pretty easy to use it's very simple is you just plug in your mic plug it into your computer and it's a compressor it does everything for you I don't want to have a a compressor uh a noise gate a I end up like it's like an airplane up here it's really really easy is that an ad no I don't know but it works
[34:58.49]When am I going to be a VTuber?
[34:59.59]I'm not a VTuber.
[35:00.29]There's somebody else that might become a VTuber eventually, but I'm not them.
[35:08.40]Yeah, give me the image.
[35:11.24]When's the Rumble?
[35:12.34]The Rumble is going to be, we're going to, 2020.
[35:15.52]The Rumble will be on January 1st, but December 31st.
[35:21.12]We're going to count down again like we did last time.
[35:25.38]And in between...
[35:27.42]matches at the Rumble, we're going to do a few categories for the worst and best of the year.
[35:32.11]We're going to do kind of a combo stream on New Year's Eve this year.
[35:35.39]That's right.
[35:37.03]Combo Germa Rumble Awards stream.
[35:41.08]Countdown New Year.
[35:43.85]And I figured we could do it like that because, as you all know, I kind of disappeared for like two and a half months.
[35:50.24]So, almost a full quarter of the year was kind of removed from this channel.
[35:55.73]So, I think we're going to just kind of put it into the Rumble.
[35:58.55]You know what I mean?
[36:04.44]We're going to do Halo Reach Stream Part 2.
[36:10.20]Uh, I'm not ever doing that again.
[36:12.50]Make the nominees fight for the award.
[36:22.52]That's going to happen at least once.
[36:24.40]That will happen, I promise that will happen at least one time.
[36:26.84]At least once.
[36:32.25]Is, what?
[36:33.99]That's going to be a long stream?
[36:35.85]No, I don't think it will.
[36:38.13]just think about it all the rumble streams are all less than three hours long it's just we watch it we do it I make it and we enjoy it and that's it and it's like two to four hours it's not usually more than three hours so you put some categories in there you have like 10 15 plus categories being to add another hour or two to the stream it's a four or five six hour stream it's perfect
[37:06.93]Okay, if you go to Chuck E. Cheese, I think they give you one of these.
[37:12.37]So this doesn't mean anything to me.
[37:17.48]You can actually get one of these.
[37:25.90]You know what I mean?
[37:26.82]Like, this is not, this photo, I mean, that's really great, but this, I feel like this is, he writes BFF on every single selfie that people take with him.
[37:36.27]How do I know that I'm special?
[37:37.29]How do I know I'm his real BFF?
[37:38.73]How am I supposed to know that?
[37:44.40]He probably writes that on all of them.
[37:47.78]But if you turn it over, and there's a note on it, you don't do that for everybody.
[38:00.53]See what it says on the back.
[38:01.49]I just did the thing where you're walking towards somebody that's in the same fucking lane as you.
[38:11.30]And like you both move at the exact same time like football players trying to avoid each other.
[38:15.14]I just did that.
[38:15.90]And I'm trying to... Like this.
[38:24.36]What does it say on the back?
[38:27.90]That hand's too small.
[38:30.46]God damn it, hold on.
[39:05.25]I want to do... Why is this a color corrector?
[39:15.59]What the fuck is this?
[39:22.24]Why is this fucked up?
[39:25.36]Sorry, my OBS is fucked up.
[39:27.18]Why is it not showing me that I can't like... The scroll is so weird.
[39:29.92]Why is it doing this?
[39:31.46]I was going to make myself black and white.
[39:32.92]Forget it.
[39:35.20]It says, it says, we're best friends.
[39:37.16]Forget it.
[39:37.48]I can't, I was gonna do something funny.
[39:44.39]Why?
[39:44.69]This is annoying me.
[39:45.39]Why?
[39:45.61]I wish I could show this.
[39:48.39]Now this whole thing is fucked up.
[39:54.89]What the f- I just want, like, a bunch of little ants in my computer to do all this work for me.
[40:00.03]That, like, that behind-the-scenes stuff.
[40:03.15]I mean, don't you wish I could just have a computer with, like, an ant in it that could, like, live, like, a really comfortable life in there and they can, like, control everything?
[40:08.40]Oh, and everything's messed up now.
[40:25.08]I don't know what's- I don't know how to fix this.
[40:28.98]I opened up the fucking menu.
[40:34.09]And now my camera just went down like 10 points in quality.
[40:38.86]What is happening?
[40:59.86]Harold Elbertson985 just gave 20 community subs.
[41:02.96]I fucking hate this.
[41:04.18]Not you giving those subs, this.
[41:10.55]Okay, now this is the final picture.
[41:12.13]I have to, like, redo this.
[41:27.25]I don't know how this even happened.
[41:32.49]I touched the gamma once and my computer exploded.
[41:36.05]Don't look at those fucking spoilers back there.
[41:37.89]Get out of here!
[41:39.53]I see you peeking like, what's over there?
[41:41.50]What game is that?
[41:42.04]What's the next game?
[41:42.76]I don't even think about it.
[41:44.38]What happened to the camera?
[42:09.74]Where did I go?
[42:17.50]Where am I?
[42:23.96]Hold on, what?
[42:26.02]Oh, I changed the resolution.
[42:37.55]Everything's broken.
[42:38.13]I actually broke it.
[42:38.97]I don't know what I did.
[42:40.13]I have no idea what's going on.
[42:50.35]Where is this picture?
[42:51.77]You guys can't see it, but it looks even worse.
[42:59.83]What?
[43:12.49]I don't understand.
[43:14.25]Okay, let me change this.
[43:28.03]All right, the stream is over.
[43:30.15]The stream ended 30 minutes ago.
[43:32.37]I don't know what's going on now.
[43:33.91]I've lost it.
[43:35.05]I've lost control of the stream.
[43:58.72]Hold on, we're getting where we're going.
[43:59.76]I'm working backwards.
[44:00.54]Hold on.
[44:14.95]This is just every FMV video clip on the Sega CD.
[44:25.22]HD Jerva.
[44:31.63]Add scan lines to it.
[44:35.49]It's been four.
[44:36.05]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[44:37.17]I'm gonna go.
[44:38.01]I got nothing else planned.
[44:45.50]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[44:47.58]Tomorrow we're gonna... It was Chuck E. Cheese, man.
[44:55.86]Chuck E. Cheese.
[44:56.68]I feel like I'm in a fucking dream.
[45:04.73]Can we nominate best one-guy moment for when a Chuck E. Cheese derailed the whole stream?
[45:11.57]That's my nomination.
[45:22.52]All right, I don't want to hurt anybody's eyes.
[45:25.28]Yeah, I'm gonna call.
[45:26.52]I'm done.
[45:27.32]I'm done.
[45:27.86]I'm done.
[45:29.90]That's fast credits.
[45:31.14]Holy shit.
[45:32.17]How many people subscribed today?
[45:36.37]Of a lot, a very large amount of people actually.
[45:39.77]This is almost a thousand people.
[45:54.66]Oh yeah, why did I do 50 community subs?
[46:00.21]This one's just lost in my brain.
[46:09.47]I fell.
[46:10.29]Right, right, right.
[46:11.05]Alright, so what are we doing tomorrow?
[46:18.57]What's the deal tomorrow?
[46:19.26]Saturday is the DLC part 2.
[46:30.38]I mean, we could do more of that game.
[46:34.61]The ship one.
[46:36.83]If not, then... Oh, we can probably pick Custom Robo.
[46:40.43]I got Custom Robo.
[46:41.47]I got a bunch of Xbox stuff.
[46:52.15]Saw 2?
[46:53.75]You know what?
[46:56.07]We might be able to do Saw.
[46:57.91]Let me see if... Because I have Saw 2 now.
[47:01.10]How much time?
[47:01.64]Anybody remember how much time was left in Saw 1?
[47:06.24]Like an hour, right?
[47:12.51]It was not 10 hours left.
[47:13.57]It was probably maybe an hour in the first one.
[47:16.35]45 minutes.
[47:16.81]Yeah.
[47:18.65]I'll think about it.
[47:19.71]We're either going to finish Saw 1 and move on to Saw 2 tomorrow, or I'm going to play Custom Robo, or a mystery PC game.
[47:30.96]Anything about that?
[47:39.51]That was a lot of fun, though.
[47:40.29]This was fun.
[47:42.71]Got a little weird, but it was fun.
[47:45.69]Thanks for watching, as always, guys.
[47:49.16]Again, September 13th.
[47:51.20]Mark it on your calendar.
[47:52.06]3 p.m.
[47:54.22]if you're an active sub.
[47:55.74]You can play in the FTK server.
[47:57.98]It's going to get streamed.
[47:59.76]It's going to be all kinds of fun.
[48:04.56]I am looking forward to it.
[48:09.81]No more Euro streams.
[48:11.49]This is a Euro stream.
[48:12.49]Yeah, it is.
[48:20.58]Started at like around noon, right?
[48:22.60]Pacific?
[48:23.60]That's pretty Euro friendly, isn't it?
[48:27.96]Where's the radioactive skeleton pick?
[48:30.08]I will show that the minute that I actually have it.
[48:32.40]Do a raid, raid, raid, raid.
[48:36.72]Who do you want to raid?
[48:39.52]Who are we rating?
[48:40.58]Who's available right now?
[48:44.87]Chuck E. Cheese.
[48:45.43]Chuck E. Cheese is offline.
[48:46.55]I don't think Chuck E. Cheese is streaming right now.
[48:56.36]Do it anyway.
[48:59.54]Rate an offline chat?
[49:08.31]I've seen a lot of Lemmy.
[49:09.99]Lemmy, Lemmy, Lemmy.
[49:11.15]Who else we got?
[49:16.01]He's a cool dude.
[49:22.60]Tomato.
[49:23.10]Tomato's a cool dude, too.
[49:24.98]Yeah, that's two.
[49:34.69]Alright.
[49:35.83]I don't know.
[49:36.41]I don't know.
[49:37.99]Put it in half?
[49:40.53]Alright, half of you go to Tomato, half of you go to Lemmy.
[49:43.29]How does that sound?
[49:48.81]Lame.
[49:49.27]Don't split us up.
[49:50.53]Alright.
[49:53.04]That's not... You do it.
[49:55.12]You do it.
[49:55.64]You do it.
[50:01.52]Alright, number generator.
[50:02.58]1 to 2.
[50:02.98]Here we go.
[50:03.38]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[50:04.38]Alright, we're going to Lemmy.
[50:14.57]Tomato's fucking awesome too, though.
[50:15.69]Go watch him too.
[50:17.85]Go watch all these people.
[50:18.77]They're all fucking fantastic.
[50:28.14]I wish you could split the raid.
[50:29.60]Wouldn't that be cool?
[50:31.65]If we could, like, just, like, spread out a bunch of, like, a bunch of different places, that would be kind of fun.
[50:38.76]Is that, like, too dumb of an idea?
[50:40.20]Is that, like, a stupid fucking idea?
[50:41.84]Alright, go tell, uh, go say hello to Lemmy.
[50:49.59]That's a stupid idea?
[50:50.31]I wish Chuck E. Cheese was live right now.
[50:53.75]We would just dump on him.
[51:01.23]Alright, the next time Chuck E. Cheese is live, I want to make sure, I want to dump a raid on Chuck E. Cheese.
[51:08.93]I'm starting that.
[51:09.93]I'm going for it.
[51:12.22]Keep an eye out.
[51:29.65]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[51:38.79]Is this the second time I've raided Limmie, right?
[51:44.13]Does he look back and go like, who the fuck is this guy?
[51:48.88]Like, Limmie, we're coming to say hi!
[51:55.56]I don't know him.
[51:56.18]He doesn't know me at all.
[51:57.30]It's just like, we're arriving, Limmie!
[51:59.86]Okay, okay.
[52:02.06]Hi, guys.
[52:02.72]What's up?
[52:10.30]Did I say Vinny?
[52:14.28]No, I said Lemmy, didn't I?
[52:15.46]Alright, see you guys later.
[52:20.01]See you tomorrow.
[52:21.89]Around the same time.
[52:22.83]Goodbye, goodnight.
[52:24.23]Take care.
