[01:02.13]Hello there.
[01:02.85]How's everybody doing?
[01:03.69]Welcome to the stream.
[01:06.57]Today, we're a little close to the mic.
[01:10.24]Good evening.
[01:12.00]Hold on.
[01:12.58]I'm like sitting in front of the computer.
[01:15.02]Just give me one moment.
[01:15.70]Everybody chill out.
[01:17.97]Sorry we're starting so late.
[01:19.07]There's an explanation.
[01:19.93]I'll see you in a minute.
[01:42.76]Hey, how you doing, you jokers?
[01:45.82]It's me, Jeremy.
[01:48.42]Jeremy B-A-F.
[01:51.09]Today's the painting stream.
[01:53.11]Hey, you know the thing that I've been talking about for like six months?
[01:57.39]Hey, we're doing that tonight.
[01:58.91]Isn't that fun?
[02:00.43]Isn't that going to be fun, guys?
[02:02.39]I can't wait.
[02:04.85]In fact, in just a moment here, you're going to be able to see the whole setup that took like four hours to fucking make.
[02:12.71]So let me just, let me like get into position.
[02:14.17]Hold on.
[02:15.03]I didn't like sneak under here.
[02:21.53]I'm back.
[02:22.03]And so is the snake boy.
[02:22.99]You know, you guys have no idea how fucked up this is.
[02:24.87]This took a long time.
[02:25.72]A long time.
[02:42.20]A long time.
[02:43.14]Hey!
[02:43.90]But we're here!
[02:44.76]We're here.
[02:45.47]We're ready to paint some paintings.
[02:48.05]As you see, we got plenty- Look, do you see how fucking hard this was?
[02:52.67]This is not just a typical setup.
[02:54.57]We got the center here.
[02:56.10]We got the centerpiece.
[02:57.40]Pentacam setup.
[02:58.68]You ever seen five fucking cameras on a screen before in your life?
[03:01.94]Don't think so.
[03:03.28]if you have well you got cameras there we got cameras here we got cameras over there too there's cameras in every direction hi I'm Jeremy and that's Etalyx we don't go by his first name only mine here alright let's uh let's describe what this is going to be so this is going to be a painting stream as you see he has a painting in front of him well it will be a painting when I'm done with it
[03:29.61]Right now it's just a blank canvas, as you can clearly see here on camera four.
[03:34.95]You're gonna hang it up?
[03:39.89]I am.
[03:40.83]When it's all said and done.
[03:42.53]So I don't know how many people know this or not, but I am actually very, very much involved in painting.
[03:47.23]I've been involved since I was like 15 years old.
[03:49.95]I actually have a few pieces here before we start to paint.
[03:53.03]Let me just show you some things here.
[03:54.73]These are currently hanging up in my house.
[03:57.70]I want to make sure we get to see these before we start.
[04:01.12]So here is just a small sample of my work.
[04:06.46]I went to college for this.
[04:08.60]This is called Fenced In, as you can see.
[04:11.46]Beautiful.
[04:11.68]Make sure we can see that.
[04:12.64]It says a lot emotionally about you.
[04:14.54]Yeah, you can see the fence here and the sun and the moon and everything up here.
[04:19.36]This actually took a long time to make.
[04:20.83]This is what they call the magic hour, if you're familiar.
[04:24.57]A professor in college told me that this is one of the most intense emotional paintings he's ever seen.
[04:31.56]So, and like down here, this is like a, you ever build like a fence before and you like, you cut your hand and blood and soul.
[04:38.00]That's one of my favorites for sure.
[04:39.74]It's beautiful.
[04:41.72]This next one is actually when I went to, when I went to Germany for the first time, there was this bridge in Germany that I had to paint.
[04:51.60]And I think this was called the Stahlhelm Bridge, I think is what it is in Germany.
[04:58.99]Stahlhelm.
[04:59.59]Stahlhelm, yeah.
[05:01.29]I took a lot of detail work.
[05:03.55]If you can tell, the grassy area down here, I started, you make mistakes when you paint it, it's okay.
[05:10.78]I found the murder of crows above the bridge particularly inspiring.
[05:14.42]That's right, that's right.
[05:15.10]You can see, I was really, really influenced when I was like 22 or so from McDonald's.
[05:21.37]So again, a couple of golden arches here.
[05:23.43]Nothing too out of the ordinary.
[05:25.03]I was reading a little Edgar Allan Poe, I think, when you put this one to the canvas.
[05:29.36]But my favorite of all.
[05:31.04]Absolutely my absolute favorite.
[05:32.70]Because it touches me a little emotionally.
[05:36.82]You paint from your heart.
[05:37.78]You paint from your heart.
[05:40.71]I like to call this one me and dad.
[05:45.65]That's me and my dad and I painted this one from the heart here.
[05:50.05]He just made you so happy.
[05:51.17]He made me very happy when I was younger and
[05:54.11]He's the rock in my life.
[05:55.85]You know what I mean?
[05:57.69]This is called Me and My Dear Old Dad.
[06:00.05]I'm not sure if you can see that.
[06:04.26]Look, when you are working with art, don't do it from up here.
[06:09.12]Okay?
[06:11.52]Do it from in here, god damn it.
[06:12.84]You know what I mean?
[06:13.60]Do it from inside of this hole right here, god damn it.
[06:15.56]You know what I'm saying?
[06:16.90]Sorry.
[06:18.04]Respect that.
[06:19.75]So today, I'm going to
[06:23.84]Harness this and use it on the fucking platform.
[06:25.62]You know what I mean?
[06:27.34]Harness it and use it.
[06:28.46]Dig deep.
[06:28.92]Dig deep and use it.
[06:29.68]Bring it to the surface.
[06:30.69]So what we're doing today is... Dad, I love you.
[06:36.11]We're going to listen to you.
[06:37.95]So pretty much what we're going to do is the first word that we see in chat.
[06:42.75]Right now, literally the first word that we see in chat is going to be what we're going to paint.
[06:47.34]Do it!
[06:52.40]Garfield!
[06:53.16]Oh, fuck.
[06:56.39]Alright, well let me see what you're painting with.
[06:57.75]We're going to paint Garfield first, okay?
[07:01.54]That sounds like a good enough start.
[07:03.56]I don't want to paint Garfield first.
[07:08.32]Okay, we're painting Garfield first.
[07:09.62]Hey, class!
[07:12.48]Hey, class!
[07:13.80]What's the most important thing when you have a painting class and painting tools?
[07:18.22]Oh.
[07:18.54]Move a little this way.
[07:20.10]Hey, class.
[07:21.56]There you go.
[07:22.70]What's the most important thing when you're painting?
[07:25.02]Your tools.
[07:25.86]You've got to have them.
[07:26.70]OK.
[07:27.30]So I like to work with the same tools I've been using for a long time.
[07:32.06]These have seen some love.
[07:33.53]Yeah, they came.
[07:34.27]I mean, look at what they did.
[07:36.03]We already just saw what they're capable of.
[07:37.79]I got a red pen in there in case you have to make some corrections for your essay or whatever you're writing.
[07:42.43]So those are mine.
[07:43.41]This is what I work with, a couple of flat brushes.
[07:46.53]Pretty standard shit, you know what I'm saying?
[07:48.69]He says standard, I say insufficient.
[07:52.00]I wanna show you all what I'm gonna be working with today.
[07:54.52]What do you got?
[07:57.22]You got like money in there?
[08:04.27]Voila!
[08:05.79]This is what I'm gonna be painting with today.
[08:08.76]I have a selection of colored pencils, watercolor pencils.
[08:12.83]I believe I have some crayons down here that, when mixed with water, can make some beautiful colors.
[08:17.13]I have a variety of brushes, a pencil sharpener, in case any of these get dull.
[08:21.03]We've got some acrylics in here, I believe, as well.
[08:23.35]A little wash, just in case the brushes get a little bit too out of sorts, mix too many colors in.
[08:28.03]And then two flower-petal-shaped palettes.
[08:30.97]I don't know if you can see those, so let me tilt it forward so you can... There you go.
[08:35.78]Some of those are alright, but like...
[08:41.70]Me and my dad painted that picture when we were younger.
[08:44.72]And these are the brushes we use.
[08:46.82]So my emotional support is much more important, right?
[08:50.80]Let me make some room for you so you can get those brushes down there.
[08:54.14]So, you know, you can try to make something with them.
[08:57.42]That's okay.
[09:00.16]Learn how to fake cry better.
[09:01.58]You fucking loser.
[09:04.46]I'm not the one with a bandana on my head.
[09:07.10]Me and dad.
[09:08.36]Me and my fucking dad.
[09:12.13]to Garfield.
[09:13.37]Garfield's first.
[09:14.23]I'd like some water, please.
[09:16.41]Why don't you go get it?
[09:17.53]I'm going to get it.
[09:18.52]These are going to be so... You have so much more cool shit.
[09:24.12]There's one water for me.
[09:27.06]And one water... Don't spill it, Jeremy!
[09:33.13]It's not gonna be one of those streams, trust me.
[09:35.45]It's not gonna be the Spill the Water stream.
[09:37.15]I can't even see, but somebody just gave $100.
[09:40.33]It was Lamb, Lamb666.
[09:43.33]We can't see this.
[09:44.11]We can't hear anything.
[09:44.98]Lamb Blam.
[09:45.86]Thank you, Lamb Blam.
[09:46.84]Lamb Blam, I know who that is.
[09:48.18]I'm a fucking idiot.
[09:49.66]Alright, so this is Garfield, okay?
[09:51.18]I'm Garfield.
[09:52.28]Look, so you have, do I even have orange?
[09:55.18]This is what I get to work with.
[09:59.16]I do.
[09:59.96]Where the fuck did you even, did you bring this on the plane?
[10:03.04]Oh, you told me to get him prepared for anything.
[10:04.45]Are you that much of a psycho?
[10:06.27]Sorry, I got room over here on my fucking crotch.
[10:08.91]Alright, we're gonna go with Garfield.
[10:09.95]Do you know what Garfield looks like?
[10:10.79]Yeah, you got ample space right there.
[10:12.23]Alright, book is coming out of my nose.
[10:13.29]Alright, do you know what Garfield looks like?
[10:15.07]I do.
[10:15.47]He's a orange tabby cat.
[10:17.09]He's orange.
[10:18.35]He is.
[10:18.83]Let's get started.
[10:19.41]With, uh, is it black stripes on his back?
[10:21.86]Yeah.
[10:22.74]Actually, shh.
[10:23.70]No, I don't know.
[10:25.38]So here's what's gonna happen.
[10:26.16]We're gonna determine whose picture of Garfield is better.
[10:28.40]How long do you got?
[10:28.88]Like, 20 minutes?
[10:29.32]20 minutes?
[10:30.31]10 minutes?
[10:30.93]Is that too long?
[10:31.75]Is that like too long?
[10:33.09]I don't know how long this is going to take.
[10:36.59]I don't even have my paints out.
[10:38.11]You've got yours, so let me get mine.
[10:39.47]I need my little thing.
[10:40.27]Where is it?
[10:43.39]There it is.
[10:44.35]Alright, we're good.
[10:46.35]First of all, if you want to paint.
[10:47.87]I don't know which one of these is mine, but I'm going to guess it's this one.
[10:56.56]I mean, we've been...
[10:58.40]We've been drinking, like, the last two nights.
[11:00.62]I don't typically do this.
[11:02.22]Friend of mine's in town.
[11:03.68]You gotta have, like, one or two, right?
[11:07.02]So, let me get started.
[11:08.00]I gotta have orange.
[11:08.90]We're gonna get this open the old-fashioned way.
[11:11.78]How do you make orange?
[11:13.30]Do you know?
[11:14.42]What's orange?
[11:15.82]Careful with what I am about to do.
[11:17.70]What are you doing?
[11:19.43]What the fuck are you doing?
[11:20.35]I'm trying to pop the paints open.
[11:23.11]Orange is red and yellow, right?
[11:25.21]It should be.
[11:28.84]don't tell me what yellow it's yellow and red yeah see yellow and red right so look we're not don't don't like fucking go crazy don't let go fast there's no reason to just calm down we're all we're all antsy right now and this is not even fucking working
[11:49.45]I thought orange was yellow and red.
[11:51.44]Looks like you're getting ready to make a cheeseburger there.
[11:53.88]Fucking Garfield's not red.
[11:55.14]Hold on.
[11:55.76]God damn it.
[11:56.38]I fucked it up already.
[12:00.06]Ketchup and mustard.
[12:03.90]It's way too early for that.
[12:05.84]It's way too early for that.
[12:08.82]We took precautions against just such... We got a trash bag.
[12:11.68]Everyone calm down.
[12:12.76]I'm going to drop all this paint on me.
[12:14.66]Sorry.
[12:14.90]These are like my dad's pajamas.
[12:16.33]Me and my...
[12:18.90]Let's not talk about dad anymore.
[12:20.04]Me and my dads, but yeah, let's not talk about dad anymore.
[12:22.38]Okay, I got orange here.
[12:24.05]Almost.
[12:26.07]Fuck, he's gonna be like a fucking lasagna.
[12:36.15]Okay.
[12:36.27]Okay.
[12:36.37]Alright, Garfield.
[12:40.06]Eureka moment.
[12:41.08]Oops.
[12:43.44]There goes another one.
[12:44.18]There goes another one.
[12:45.12]Okay, Garfield.
[12:46.34]Mm-hmm.
[12:46.79]Lasagna.
[12:49.33]Again, this is not a competition.
[12:51.03]Yes, it is.
[12:51.67]Okay, it's a competition.
[12:54.27]Who can do it the best?
[12:55.23]Let me be a little heavy here.
[13:00.39]Lasagna is typically a couple of lines, and then... Oh, we're drawing lasagna, too.
[13:06.12]He has to be eating?
[13:07.14]You do your own interpretation.
[13:08.22]I'll do mine.
[13:13.30]Get the streaks there of that orangey yellow.
[13:15.70]We gotta get some more yellow there.
[13:16.58]Otherwise this is not gonna work.
[13:19.84]Metallics wins.
[13:21.45]He drew a fucking orange circle.
[13:24.89]Art is interpretatable.
[13:27.49]Don't try to tell me that his is better.
[13:29.07]Alright, we're gonna need a bigger brush than this, clearly.
[13:31.07]Well, you borrow one of mine.
[13:32.13]If you got mine, you got a great setup.
[13:34.09]Listen, did I say I needed your brushes from your like office pencil container?
[13:40.51]No, I got my own, clearly here, plenty.
[13:45.85]This is good so far.
[13:49.29]This is the lasagna.
[13:49.99]Going to get some, maybe a little bit of extra cheese in there.
[13:55.59]Can you guys see the waves?
[13:56.43]You can see that, right?
[13:57.45]Because mine is going to, it's not going to be a literal interpretation.
[14:04.14]You're going for more of the abstract approach.
[14:06.38]Kind of, yeah.
[14:10.36]He loves lasagna.
[14:12.82]You know what I'm saying?
[14:13.46]He's got a koala ear.
[14:16.26]How did I get this far ahead of you?
[14:18.36]You're using a brush that is the size of... Well, do you want a bigger brush?
[14:23.81]It's interpretive.
[14:25.33]Mine doesn't have to be completely painted in solid colors.
[14:28.07]This isn't second grade where they tell you to color inside the lines only.
[14:33.69]But if I want Garfield to look like a koala head, then that's what you're going to get.
[14:37.33]Oh, I see where we're going with this.
[14:39.34]We're going with the low-hanging fruit right now.
[14:41.30]He's like a cheese car.
[14:42.82]I really fucked this up.
[14:43.90]No, I didn't.
[14:44.48]Shut up.
[14:45.99]Don't worry, I didn't fuck it up.
[14:47.71]We're going for the low hanging fruit.
[14:49.75]He's like gonna go like this, you know what I mean?
[14:51.19]Like his hands are in the air.
[14:52.45]Cause he's like frong.
[14:54.91]I'm so fucking far.
[14:55.93]Like nice Mickey Mouse.
[14:57.09]Nice fucking nacho cheese Mickey Mouse.
[14:59.97]Look.
[15:00.15]Okay, hold on.
[15:03.81]This is just to get the base down.
[15:05.58]This is not to do anything like besides that.
[15:07.12]This is just to get an orange base.
[15:09.74]Cause I'm gonna go in with a marker and I'm gonna make, I'm gonna outline it.
[15:12.94]Cheetos cat.
[15:15.55]It's not Cheetos Cat.
[15:17.73]It's Garfield, man.
[15:20.71]We're going to take our time on these.
[15:22.11]No, what did I say?
[15:22.87]20 minutes?
[15:23.13]You said 20 minutes.
[15:25.47]Sure.
[15:25.97]It's been about eight minutes.
[15:27.41]What does Garfield's face look like?
[15:30.21]That's the question of the ages.
[15:33.91]Just got to get it in there.
[15:34.85]I'll fix this.
[15:35.33]Don't worry.
[15:35.67]Watch this.
[15:36.07]Okay, so let's get a brush in there.
[15:39.53]Let's clean that.
[15:40.25]It ain't easy.
[15:41.71]It really is not easy.
[15:42.43]Art's not easy.
[15:49.92]Just get a good outline here.
[15:54.39]Because he is... I mean, as long as he... I want a little bit of detail here, you know?
[16:00.01]Kind of like an embossed look.
[16:06.18]So far, so good.
[16:07.00]This is... I got to get a little bigger than that.
[16:10.14]Is there any black in here?
[16:11.04]Yeah, there is.
[16:11.50]I got black.
[16:13.12]Just don't fucking touch that.
[16:14.66]Where's black?
[16:18.11]That's a good question, because that's exactly where I'm going for next.
[16:21.38]Fuck, mine sucks compared to yours.
[16:24.26]I need to, like, dry this quicker than this is working.
[16:31.16]How do you, how the fuck, how do people do this?
[16:33.58]Well, hold on, when I was... How do people do this?
[16:36.00]When I was doing it, I usually, we had a freeze-dry process.
[16:40.48]So once I was done with one layer...
[16:42.58]it would go into the freeze dryer, and it'd be at minus 62 degrees Celsius, which would dry the paint in less than 15 seconds.
[16:49.93]Obviously, that was back when I was fucking much more talented and had a lot more resources.
[16:55.39]That's when you painted those, right?
[16:56.53]Yeah.
[16:58.25]This works.
[16:58.57]Back when you were talented.
[16:59.99]I mean, back when I had more resources.
[17:01.29]Talent has nothing to do with it.
[17:02.90]Right.
[17:03.74]It's resources, you know?
[17:09.08]Garfield's like kind of... Alright, this is drying pretty well.
[17:12.28]It's not going so poorly.
[17:15.63]What are you doing over there?
[17:16.81]Opening my next beautiful paint.
[17:19.03]You're not even coloring your Garfield in, are you?
[17:21.43]That's what I'm doing next.
[17:23.02]I'm getting the black paint right now.
[17:25.19]My Garfield's pretty angry for some reason.
[17:27.59]Don't ask me why.
[17:28.43]Yeah, he's starting to look a little bit like the Yeti from that old game that I played in Windows 95.
[17:33.32]Oh, the snow game?
[17:34.70]Yeah.
[17:35.48]Yeah, snow, what's it called?
[17:37.34]Snowboard.
[17:37.94]Ski.
[17:38.60]Ski free.
[17:39.30]Ski free.
[17:39.86]Ski free!
[17:40.44]That's what we're making.
[17:41.20]That's what you're making.
[17:43.78]Not really.
[17:45.33]You can interpret it however you want.
[17:47.69]Just wait till I get the face on here.
[17:49.05]He doesn't even know what Garfield looks like.
[17:51.07]He doesn't even know what his fucking face looks like, let alone what he acts like.
[17:56.89]It's good like that.
[17:59.33]And by the way, if you're curious, all of these paintings will be available in the dumpster.
[18:04.21]In case you were wondering.
[18:05.37]And that's where we're going to be selling prints is dumpster.com.
[18:10.44]If you guys want to check out some of these finished products, they will be going in the trash.
[18:16.94]Trash is just the casual name for dumpster.com.
[18:19.52]Yeah.
[18:20.96]Is there a dumpster.com?
[18:23.68]Well... Just fucking copying me.
[18:25.20]I say that's fine.
[18:27.31]You are just copying the shit out of me.
[18:29.17]Alright, your Garfield is like a mouse.
[18:38.82]Just wait till we get to the detail work.
[18:40.30]Do you know what Garfield's face actually looks like?
[18:42.66]Vaguely.
[18:43.06]Yeah, vaguely.
[18:44.20]I know what his face looks like.
[18:46.84]He's on wheels.
[18:47.66]He's like a Garfield Zumbini.
[18:51.18]You just worry about your painting over there and we'll wait until everything is done.
[18:55.56]Has it been 20 minutes?
[18:56.87]No.
[18:58.83]I just put that on my face.
[18:59.79]I just scratched my fucking face like a moron.
[19:03.97]I'm going to get to the detail here.
[19:04.97]I'm going to fill in his feet.
[19:10.22]He's got paws.
[19:15.66]If you ever take a painting class, there's a lot of drunk painting classes, which are actually pretty fun.
[19:21.83]If you ever have an opportunity to, I highly suggest you do it, because it is actually very entertaining.
[19:27.54]It's funny that you should mention that because... Are you drinking now?
[19:32.65]I'm way ahead of you, buddy.
[19:34.85]That's true.
[19:36.67]That's true.
[19:37.25]What's everybody's favorite art?
[19:39.63]Huh?
[19:41.03]I think I would have to say mine is Galileo.
[19:45.33]Because he put the planets in the right order.
[19:48.56]That was like an emote joke.
[19:50.46]I am about to move on to detail.
[19:52.98]That's where I'm going right now, my friend.
[19:57.81]And it's time for the curveball!
[19:59.21]First thing in chat we see, we're gonna add it.
[20:00.53]Come on.
[20:01.45]First thing we see, the first fucking word.
[20:03.00]Curveball.
[20:04.06]What are we adding to this?
[20:04.76]Come on.
[20:05.42]Word.
[20:05.70]First word.
[20:13.58]Somebody said, no.
[20:15.30]No!
[20:15.88]No, we're not adding dicks.
[20:17.68]Skip, I, what, did you see a word?
[20:20.32]Uh...
[20:24.46]I missed it.
[20:24.90]It was dicks, but we're not adding a dick.
[20:27.12]I'm not putting a dick on Garfield.
[20:28.28]That's not gonna happen.
[20:29.86]It's not gonna be dicks.
[20:32.08]No, that's not fucking happening.
[20:33.36]I'm not drawing a dick on Garfield.
[20:35.20]No way.
[20:40.48]I saw money.
[20:41.46]I saw money.
[20:42.10]Curveball.
[20:42.64]Money curveball.
[20:43.42]We'll get that in here in a minute.
[20:45.48]Detail work.
[20:47.90]Hey, did I get you with that curveball?
[20:49.22]Blue.
[20:50.98]It's because I don't have access to black.
[20:52.78]Alright, Garfield, close my eyes and see Garfield's face.
[20:55.39]Close my eyes and see it.
[20:56.03]That's all I have to see.
[20:56.61]I see it.
[21:02.21]I see it.
[21:02.87]I can already see it.
[21:04.49]He's got the two big eyes, right?
[21:05.67]Yep, close my eyes.
[21:06.34]That's all you gotta do.
[21:10.18]And then he's got, he's got like the little, like octopus mouth.
[21:22.10]I can't find my brushes.
[21:28.24]Wait, it's... Are you okay over there?
[21:36.06]It's the other way.
[21:37.36]Don't look at this.
[21:37.98]It goes like this.
[21:43.70]Oh, God damn it.
[21:46.44]Are you sure you still want to compare whatever you got over there going to mine?
[21:49.68]This is not right.
[21:50.38]This is not right.
[21:50.96]This is not right.
[21:51.48]I got to go over this.
[21:59.18]No.
[22:00.42]Shit.
[22:01.70]I got to close my eyes.
[22:03.42]That's not what he looks like.
[22:04.38]This is like an owl.
[22:04.98]What is his nose?
[22:07.72]He does.
[22:08.02]There we go.
[22:15.50]It's coming together.
[22:16.02]It's going to get red.
[22:17.18]He's got like a red tongue.
[22:19.21]No, he doesn't.
[22:22.67]White eyes.
[22:23.03]I need white.
[22:25.53]Oh, do you?
[22:26.57]I do.
[22:27.45]What the fuck happened here?
[22:28.35]Did you do that?
[22:29.37]You did that, I believe, at the beginning.
[22:31.61]Give me your white paint right now.
[22:34.74]Here.
[22:35.50]I demand it.
[22:36.96]No, I have white.
[22:37.88]Where the fuck is it?
[22:39.68]Here is... Oh, is it right here?
[22:42.32]Oh, yeah.
[22:42.60]Here you go.
[22:47.27]Uh, where do you want it?
[22:48.15]I'll give you the white.
[22:48.79]I need white.
[22:51.51]Where?
[22:52.81]Like, just give it to me.
[22:53.55]Where do you want it, though?
[22:55.13]Oh!
[22:56.27]Like, right there.
[22:57.15]Where?
[22:58.43]Just put it, like, in the, like, this... That's not white, that's black.
[23:02.34]You gave me the wrong fucking color.
[23:03.98]Oh my god.
[23:05.78]Garfield doesn't have black eyes.
[23:07.24]Uh... Can I, like...
[23:15.98]Can I smell you, what you're doing over there?
[23:18.41]Stay away.
[23:18.85]Let me just give it, let me just smell it.
[23:19.83]You have like the scratch and sniff fucking paint.
[23:21.71]Let me smell it.
[23:23.89]I know you have the scratch and sniff paint.
[23:25.31]Let me smell it for a sec.
[23:26.47]Got it.
[23:30.17]Let the record show, someone came prepared to this stream.
[23:34.19]This is not even fucking working.
[23:35.55]God damn it.
[23:37.27]Give me, where's your white?
[23:39.51]Actually, I don't know.
[23:40.21]Is it in there?
[23:40.91]Got it right here.
[23:42.23]Careful now.
[23:43.03]Careful.
[23:44.11]I know, this has to last another six or seven hours.
[23:47.21]This has to last for the rest of the stream.
[23:49.25]Oh, fuck, I blew it already.
[23:50.45]What does Garfield's nose look like?
[23:52.51]I know he doesn't have a mustache.
[23:53.73]You know what a cat's nose looks like?
[23:54.62]Does he have a blue mustache?
[23:56.42]No, he doesn't have a blue mustache.
[24:00.12]My Garfield's been doing a lot of drugs.
[24:06.06]I truly don't know.
[24:06.82]Koala or, like, Simba.
[24:08.56]I don't know what...
[24:10.50]God dammit, like that- this is why you need multiple- WHY AM I USING THE SAME BRUSH?!
[24:16.70]What does his mouth look like?
[24:17.80]Is it like- I did his mouth wrong, don't look at mine.
[24:20.68]I- his mouth goes- no, you did it- you did it right!
[24:24.78]I did the cat- I just did a cat face!
[24:26.43]See, I went the other way.
[24:27.53]I did the cat face!
[24:28.95]That does not look like- alright.
[24:32.17]Yours does not look like Garfield, mine look- That's the cat face!
[24:37.57]Yours looks nothing like Garfield, it really doesn't.
[24:41.00]At least mine is like Garfield if he got hit in the face with a shovel.
[24:44.62]No, that's Garfield standing in the street.
[24:47.68]There's an oncoming car about to hit him.
[24:50.88]And he's panicking.
[24:53.36]I gotta fix his feet.
[24:54.43]And his feet are like Roadrunner wheels.
[24:57.21]Just wait a second.
[25:02.20]Wait, what was the word?
[25:03.10]What was the secret word?
[25:04.34]Money.
[25:04.80]The safe word?
[25:05.50]The secret... No, not the... Don't even.
[25:08.08]Stop that shit.
[25:08.98]It was money.
[25:10.40]So I got... Here, you can take your white bag.
[25:12.59]It wasn't money.
[25:13.27]It was money.
[25:14.67]So I'm already in a good position to put a whole dollar over his head.
[25:18.01]I was ready for the curveball.
[25:18.93]You weren't.
[25:21.63]You weren't ready for the curveball.
[25:24.09]He's gonna hold a giant dollar bill.
[25:26.77]I didn't know this was a speed paint stream.
[25:29.32]I mean, this was 20 minutes.
[25:35.33]So, this is a giant dollar bill.
[25:36.59]I've got to put George Washington.
[25:37.71]I need white again, but we're going to wait until this dries.
[25:44.30]Now, when you're under pressure, like, sometimes you guys might be asking, like, well, Jerma, what about, like, the...
[25:49.93]What about the paintings that you showed earlier?
[25:52.37]They were so good.
[25:52.99]I mean, those took 6,000 to 7,000 hours each, right?
[25:57.27]So something like this is... Lots of artists, what happens is over the years, over the decades, style will change dramatically.
[26:04.84]Initially, when you're just starting out, you strive for realism.
[26:07.58]And as you develop an identity as an artist...
[26:10.69]As you figure out kind of where you want to go in your own life, you can kind of take it into more unique directions, which is what you're seeing here.
[26:17.03]You're talking about maybe like 60,000 to 70,000 hours total to do these paintings.
[26:23.04]So this one, I'm just being expressive.
[26:25.94]You know what I mean?
[26:29.52]Like sometimes you just kind of, that's like the money fucking flies.
[26:37.02]Exactly.
[26:37.58]Exactly.
[26:38.20]He doesn't fucking know a goddamn thing about art.
[26:40.48]He tries to pretend like he does.
[26:42.17]I had an art minor in college.
[26:44.23]I took like 18 credits worth of art classes.
[26:46.87]Therefore, logic determines, therefore, I.e., I know more about art than you do.
[26:51.93]You buy your fancy supplies, that's fucking fine.
[26:54.41]Buy your fancy fucking supplies.
[26:56.19]You still made a mouse.
[26:58.39]Dickhead.
[27:01.02]Uh, this is not a mouse.
[27:03.80]This is...
[27:05.21]A cat face.
[27:05.97]That's a Teletubby mouse.
[27:07.17]I win.
[27:08.33]That's a cat face.
[27:09.73]Alright, where's the money gonna go?
[27:11.31]You gotta figure out the money.
[27:12.39]Here.
[27:12.65]I'm done.
[27:19.24]This is bad.
[27:19.90]I gotta fix this.
[27:23.58]I gotta fix this one.
[27:25.20]We're gonna have to go with white and then... No, no, no.
[27:27.47]I need to like white.
[27:29.87]No, let's go gold because we're talking about gold too.
[27:32.35]Money is gold.
[27:34.39]At least it used to be.
[27:36.96]Why is this gray?
[27:37.84]This should be gold.
[27:39.38]It should not be like beige.
[27:42.96]Was he standing on money?
[27:44.60]Garfield is rich.
[27:46.24]Yes, he is.
[27:48.90]Jim Davis is very rich.
[27:52.77]Gold.
[27:54.25]So he is standing on the mountain of money.
[27:58.77]It's just turned into green.
[28:01.48]What are you drawing with a permanent marker now?
[28:03.14]Why is this green?
[28:04.80]This is supposed to be gold.
[28:11.02]Well, fuck that one up.
[28:12.43]Here, is this white?
[28:13.19]No.
[28:14.39]I need white again.
[28:16.49]Wash the brush.
[28:17.05]Let me wash the brush in our puke water.
[28:22.85]Why is it blue money?
[28:23.83]That money's not blue, it's green.
[28:25.40]Is that like not coming up for you?
[28:27.12]Fuck.
[28:30.36]It should be coming up for you.
[28:32.32]If you don't, if it's not, guys, if you can't, if you can't understand, you can't see it, press up, press up, press two in the chat.
[28:40.66]I need white because I need to do George Washington's face.
[28:42.78]Let's go with a small brush.
[28:44.94]Rinse that one.
[28:47.44]There's the money.
[28:48.85]Took the curveball, knocked it out of the park.
[28:51.27]What's the black?
[28:52.49]That's the individual bills sticking up out of the pile of money.
[28:55.97]Okay.
[28:57.93]That's fine.
[28:58.65]You didn't draw George Washington's face, though.
[29:01.48]Like I'm about to.
[29:09.69]Why did we get so quiet?
[29:13.09]What are you drawing there, bud?
[29:15.23]George Washington.
[29:19.08]Yeah.
[29:19.46]Okay.
[29:21.04]It appears to be a white circle with two S's.
[29:26.38]It looks like a fucking dollar, alright?
[29:28.99]You try to deal with all the cryogenically frozen bullshit.
[29:31.77]Come on, man.
[29:34.04]Well, you bring in George Washington to have a cryogenic sleep?
[29:37.56]Okay.
[29:38.16]That's clearly a dollar bill.
[29:39.62]It is.
[29:41.48]Alright.
[29:42.38]And... I need another word.
[29:43.40]And that's time!
[29:44.71]Okay.
[29:46.51]I finished, like, five minutes ago, so... For the close-up cam.
[29:53.51]Let's see which one's better.
[29:54.42]Here we go.
[29:56.07]That is Garfield.
[29:58.91]Nice kangaroo pouch.
[30:00.82]What is this?
[30:01.22]What's the line on this?
[30:02.60]He's fat.
[30:03.02]He's not that.
[30:03.64]He's pretty fat.
[30:04.62]Alright.
[30:05.02]We've seen yours.
[30:09.14]Garfield's fat.
[30:10.08]Okay.
[30:10.30]He's got the stomach line.
[30:11.92]First of all, first of all, we've got, he's a square.
[30:16.21]So lasagna.
[30:17.19]He's actually a fucking, he's made out of a lasagna.
[30:20.71]Money up top holding it.
[30:22.23]Doesn't need to stand on money.
[30:23.51]Jim Davis only has $100 in his bank account.
[30:26.12]And the wheels, because he keeps on turning.
[30:27.36]You know what I mean?
[30:27.90]Garfield keeps on turning.
[30:28.46]It's because he spit it all on the live-action Garfield.
[30:30.26]Garfield keeps churning out comics, so therefore he's on the move.
[30:35.02]By the way, there he goes.
[30:38.57]Speed lines?
[30:40.11]Speed lines.
[30:41.93]He's running from blood.
[30:43.59]What are people saying?
[30:45.19]Put it back.
[30:47.19]Thick equals win.
[30:48.73]Mine is bad.
[30:50.57]There's way too much paint.
[30:52.71]I wish I was made of lasagna.
[30:54.16]Why?
[30:56.76]Alright.
[30:57.56]That's art number one.
[30:58.82]We've warmed up a little.
[31:00.60]We have our warm-up period.
[31:01.72]We're going to put this down.
[31:04.32]Put that in an area where you know... One more time just to see.
[31:08.33]Put them back to back.
[31:10.13]Next to each other.
[31:10.71]There you go.
[31:11.19]Show yours.
[31:12.15]Show mine.
[31:13.19]Show yours.
[31:14.23]Okay.
[31:15.65]This next one...
[31:19.21]Before we even start here, word.
[31:21.13]Give us a word.
[31:22.03]First word I see.
[31:23.48]Come on.
[31:23.90]Let's get it.
[31:25.08]Come on.
[31:26.96]What do we got?
[31:27.30]What do we got?
[31:27.60]What do we got?
[31:27.90]What do we got?
[31:28.24]First word.
[31:28.80]First fucking word I see.
[31:32.88]Gingerbread house.
[31:34.04]Gingerbread house.
[31:34.64]You see it?
[31:34.86]I saw it.
[31:35.64]Gingerbread house.
[31:36.20]Okay.
[31:36.58]Gingerbread.
[31:37.18]It's Christmas time.
[31:37.77]That makes sense.
[31:38.93]Very thematic.
[31:39.63]Very thematic.
[31:40.35]Very, very.
[31:40.67]We're going to need some new canvases.
[31:42.25]We are going to grab us a couple of canvases, my friend.
[31:44.33]Which?
[31:45.39]Just the medium sized ones.
[31:47.05]Medium sized ones are fine.
[31:47.85]Okay.
[31:49.55]Got a couple of canvases here.
[31:50.69]Gingerbread House.
[31:53.61]Didn't think this was just going to be one painting, did you?
[31:56.68]No, this is going to be like 12 paintings.
[32:00.22]Gingerbread House.
[32:00.88]What do you mean you didn't see it?
[32:04.30]Nobody said that.
[32:04.96]Yes, they did.
[32:06.46]Somebody said Gingerbread House.
[32:08.48]Pre-recorded?
[32:09.66]Pre-recorded!
[32:11.12]You think this stream is pre-recorded?
[32:12.50]Get out of here.
[32:15.02]Spoke wise ganja.
[32:15.98]Okay, we're not gonna go there.
[32:17.52]Don't say spoke wise ganja or I will fucking, I will slay you like a dragon.
[32:21.83]Alright, gingerbread house.
[32:24.29]Somebody said it was like the fucking fourth word.
[32:25.59]What are you talking about?
[32:26.63]Gingerbread house.
[32:27.33]We need brown.
[32:28.31]Yes, we do need brown.
[32:30.06]How do you, do you just, red and like.
[32:33.70]I would do red and, well, you have brown, don't you?
[32:36.14]Like over here?
[32:37.74]These are like watercolors.
[32:39.34]Right.
[32:39.98]Well, I can make brown really easily.
[32:41.02]I've been using the acrylic because I was trying to keep the playing field even.
[32:44.51]Yeah, maybe that's true.
[32:46.53]We've got blue, red.
[32:47.57]Blue and red is brown, right?
[32:49.35]Blue, red, and yellow.
[32:49.97]Blue and red is purple.
[32:50.99]Brown is just that you take every color and fucking smash it together.
[32:54.63]Oh, every color together in the light spectrum becomes white and in paint.
[32:58.69]That's not, don't even, that's, that's, don't even, that's bullshit.
[33:01.23]Watch this.
[33:02.09]This is red, blue, and paint.
[33:04.44]Check this out.
[33:04.88]Is it going to be brown?
[33:06.20]If this is not brown, then I will... It's brown.
[33:11.54]That's not every color together.
[33:12.84]That's just three colors together.
[33:13.90]But look, it's brown.
[33:15.20]Yeah.
[33:15.50]That's clearly brown.
[33:17.16]You've got to give me a little bit of credit here.
[33:18.86]Yeah, it's just poo-poo purple.
[33:20.69]It's just a little bit of the same.
[33:21.67]But that's what brown is.
[33:22.33]Brown is like a shit purple.
[33:23.39]That's all it is.
[33:24.99]Just take purple and make it a little darker and then shit on it and you've got brown.
[33:29.27]I didn't think I was going to make brown.
[33:31.03]I fucking didn't think I knew this shit.
[33:33.91]Alright, gingerbread house.
[33:35.28]No curveball yet.
[33:36.74]Let's just get with it, let's just do it.
[33:38.80]Brown, Gingerbread House.
[33:40.06]Okay, so Gingerbread House.
[33:41.24]I'm gonna make this one a little bit more smarter than the last one.
[33:45.56]I'm going for the upgrade here.
[33:47.18]You're gonna get the yellow one, okay, cool.
[33:51.74]Gingerbread House is a steeple, right?
[33:54.28]I'm gonna make mine 3D.
[33:59.64]Mine's gonna be 3D.
[34:00.04]Christmas is in the air.
[34:07.15]So, merry fucking Christmas, by the way.
[34:11.69]Happy fucking Christmas, happy holidays.
[34:15.39]This is starting out just like the lasagna.
[34:17.97]Not done, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:20.12]I'm gonna put frosting on this and shit.
[34:21.60]It's gonna be awesome.
[34:22.32]Oh, you're gonna need to borrow my paint again to do that?
[34:26.76]No, no, no, I don't think so.
[34:28.36]I think I'll be alright.
[34:31.63]I'm pretty sure I'll be okay.
[34:33.67]Don't worry, guys, I'll get started eventually.
[34:36.74]These are brand new paints.
[34:39.00]These are brand new paints.
[34:39.86]So he has to like break every seal.
[34:41.92]Alright, that's good so far.
[34:44.76]That's a good start.
[34:46.32]I'm going to add a little bit.
[34:47.38]Let's go 3D.
[34:47.74]Remember I told you about 3D movies?
[34:49.90]Bingo.
[34:50.98]3D.
[34:53.08]You can't even imagine that.
[34:55.12]It's your tiny fucking brain.
[34:57.78]Now we're in three dimensions.
[34:59.50]Check this out.
[35:01.36]Your house just has like a... We're in 3D.
[35:08.19]Bingo.
[35:08.69]I can clean it up a little bit.
[35:14.17]3D.
[35:14.31]Well, take off your 3D glasses, guys.
[35:20.05]There we are.
[35:23.68]I gotta get a small brush here to get the detail work.
[35:27.90]That should be alright for now, at least.
[35:31.08]He doesn't even know the right combination.
[35:33.82]You don't even know the right combo.
[35:36.40]Need a little... He's got like green.
[35:38.42]Oh, you got green and blue in there.
[35:42.24]Would you like to have some brown, honey?
[35:44.41]Would you like to have some brown sun?
[35:45.53]I ain't done yet.
[35:46.77]Yeah.
[35:48.73]Yeah, you'll be fine.
[35:50.13]That's what they all say.
[35:52.73]That's what they all say.
[35:54.39]We're going to do negative space.
[35:55.69]Check this.
[35:57.94]Negative space.
[36:00.30]Because if there's frosting involved in a gingerbread house, check this shit out.
[36:05.44]Already got the frosting up here.
[36:07.37]Pull your eyes out a little.
[36:09.61]Here's the front door.
[36:11.63]Here's the front.
[36:12.19]You finally figured it out.
[36:12.99]This turned out into, like, shower gunk.
[36:15.71]Check that out.
[36:16.29]Check that out.
[36:16.77]Fucking frosting cascading down the side.
[36:18.69]You know, I thought by now, by the time it took me to mix all these paints, I would look up and I would see something resembling a gingerbread house, but instead... Look at this.
[36:28.02]Go for it.
[36:28.80]I look at that and all I see is a child's shape toy.
[36:32.96]Wild shape toy.
[36:34.22]We try to fit the right shape into the right slot.
[36:37.13]I think it looks good.
[36:38.43]I do think it looks great.
[36:40.35]So I think we'll go with a brown.
[36:42.35]I'm going to have some candy and stuff here too.
[36:45.83]What are you doing?
[36:49.11]I like the color.
[36:49.95]That's a good color actually.
[36:51.95]So let me get the other color here.
[36:53.81]Don't touch that.
[36:55.43]That's mine.
[36:57.15]See, I'm stealing.
[36:58.69]No, we don't need to steal his shit.
[37:00.61]I can do it fine.
[37:03.27]Can you give me a little bit of room, please?
[37:05.28]You've got too much shit here.
[37:07.70]Just close it up for a minute.
[37:10.88]My brushes are in the way.
[37:14.28]Contain the jealousy just a little bit more, please.
[37:16.04]You're not even using those colored pencils and you have them here.
[37:18.70]Listen, the stream's not over.
[37:20.12]The stream's not over.
[37:23.34]We're going finger painting now.
[37:25.01]There's no return from that.
[37:26.09]This is expressionism.
[37:27.33]You just tap a little bit.
[37:28.67]These are like little cotton candies.
[37:30.59]Little sprinkles.
[37:33.40]I'm gonna do blue too.
[37:35.76]This should be okay.
[37:37.38]I've already got some paint already down here, so might as well use it.
[37:44.48]Take some blue in there too, some other sprinkles.
[37:47.82]Add a little bit of sprinkles in your life, you know what I mean?
[37:51.18]Plus I can just dip my hands in there, I'll be fine.
[37:52.72]Let's go with this.
[38:02.04]No, you're doing like a walkway.
[38:03.86]Doing a little walkway.
[38:07.88]It goes off the page even.
[38:09.11]You never know where it's going to end up.
[38:10.15]You've got to use your imagination a little bit there.
[38:13.47]Don't forget about the... That's alright.
[38:17.57]Are you doing a full door?
[38:18.31]Oh, yeah.
[38:19.33]Oh, yeah.
[38:20.99]Look at that door.
[38:22.56]Look at that door.
[38:22.98]This is the most inviting gingerbread house you've ever seen.
[38:26.16]I might get lost in there.
[38:27.04]That's alright.
[38:30.73]He hasn't even added the sprinkles yet, so he can... You do windows up there, too.
[38:36.29]I, like, fucked up.
[38:36.99]I didn't do windows yet.
[38:37.75]Why don't we up the ante a little?
[38:51.96]Why don't we up the ante a little?
[38:53.18]You do yours.
[38:53.56]I'm sure you're going to fucking get brownie points here.
[38:55.94]This is how you get double fucking points here.
[39:03.21]Gotta keep going.
[39:03.73]Gotta keep going.
[39:13.75]Fucking added windows.
[39:14.91]We'll see how you add this.
[39:17.10]You fucking wanker.
[39:18.44]Check this one out.
[39:20.88]I'm going for the realism here.
[39:22.46]I'm going for the total realism.
[39:39.36]A little bit more candy there.
[39:42.78]How does this, like this?
[39:57.77]Get my Andy on me.
[40:00.19]Give me a little bit more, a little bit more imagination there, bud.
[40:03.17]It goes like this, it goes like this, it goes like this.
[40:04.59]I fucked it up, hold on.
[40:07.24]One, two, this goes on top like that.
[40:09.24]Where's my color board?
[40:10.34]I'm not gonna go down without a fight that easy.
[40:15.10]Where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it?
[40:36.74]Together, come on, come on!
[41:04.11]Come on!
[41:04.57]That looks fabulous.
[41:07.13]The supports are the wrong way.
[41:08.61]Hold on, I gotta... Maybe you should hire a better architect next week.
[41:12.56]Shut up!
[41:12.94]Here we go.
[41:36.17]That snow, snow, snow!
[41:53.38]Smiley face.
[41:54.02]You're using real candy too?
[42:07.04]Puts it in the fucking play.
[42:07.96]A little bit of fucking frosting up here.
[42:14.42]And done!
[42:15.78]How's yours?
[42:19.86]No, no, no, no!
[42:23.28]I win.
[42:24.58]I win!
[42:27.52]That's a fucking gingerbread house.
[42:29.30]That's a win!
[42:30.80]I went the extra fucking mile.
[42:32.10]I got the extra points here.
[42:38.64]You know what?
[42:40.18]Not bad.
[42:40.46]It was pretty good.
[42:42.23]Well, that's where the camera is.
[42:43.33]Gotta be careful with that.
[42:44.45]Alright, so next we're gonna get a... Let's take a look at the... Well, you already saw that, but... You're done.
[42:55.35]Uh-oh.
[42:55.93]That's it.
[42:58.02]So take into consideration what I had, right?
[43:01.60]Here's mine.
[43:03.38]He doesn't have negative space on his.
[43:04.54]Just want to put that up.
[43:06.67]I do have negative space up here on top.
[43:10.43]Let's just take it off.
[43:14.24]You can use it with paint.
[43:14.94]You can do it with your hands.
[43:15.72]That's okay.
[43:16.52]That's true.
[43:16.80]That's true.
[43:19.02]That's fine.
[43:21.26]Okay, so now we're going to do something a little different now.
[43:26.56]We're going to do something a little bit... Which one of those is yours?
[43:31.76]How about I set up the next thing and you go get us a couple of other fucking bricks?
[43:35.10]You're good.
[43:44.18]right okay so now we're gonna do something called the tandem paint we got a couple of big big boys back here we're gonna do two paintings at the same time this one requires very careful sinking requires some sinking so just hold on give us a second here this requires real sinking
[44:13.31]Let's try and align the canvases.
[44:16.07]That looks good.
[44:17.11]Line them up.
[44:18.53]Get them here.
[44:19.09]Do you want to go and press Scene 2 for me, Brent?
[44:25.93]Okay, coming through.
[44:26.81]Coming through.
[44:29.52]Pre-recorded syncing.
[44:32.12]Huh?
[44:33.44]Go ahead and press Scene 2.
[44:37.12]What are you doing?
[44:38.16]Okay, we might need to move a little bit, make a little adjustment.
[44:40.60]Just tip it up.
[44:41.38]Just tip it up a little.
[44:42.98]You tell me when I get into the right spot there, okay?
[44:45.09]Right?
[44:46.79]Good?
[44:48.07]More?
[44:49.67]Good.
[44:49.95]We're good?
[44:50.31]You're good.
[44:50.83]We're good.
[44:52.21]So this is going to be a tandem paint, as you can see here.
[44:56.35]Tandem paint.
[44:58.29]So what we're going to do here is we are just going to add things as we see them.
[45:03.54]Okay?
[45:04.20]We're just going to add things as we see them.
[45:05.86]You know what I'm saying?
[45:07.10]First of all, we've got a handprint there.
[45:09.28]We do.
[45:09.56]We do.
[45:12.79]Easy.
[45:13.86]Easy.
[45:15.02]Easy.
[45:15.38]We got a widescreen.
[45:16.42]Alright.
[45:17.08]So this is the widescreen thing.
[45:18.82]We're just going to take a minute to assume.
[45:19.98]Okay, we got rats.
[45:20.38]We're going to do rats, ammo.
[45:23.82]Rats, ammo, Pac-Man.
[45:26.11]Rats, ammo, Pac-Man, and Glue Man.
[45:27.71]Fine.
[45:28.73]Glue Man's easy.
[45:29.49]I'll let you do Glue Man.
[45:31.23]You handle that.
[45:31.75]Okay, fine.
[45:32.15]So here's... Alright, we got rat color already.
[45:34.23]Fuck this shit.
[45:35.54]You know what I'm saying?
[45:36.92]Let's make a real fucking painting.
[45:38.56]Like, no, like, oh, Garfield.
[45:40.16]Oh, look, we fucked her up.
[45:40.98]Like, I made a gingerbread.
[45:42.26]Fuck that.
[45:43.43]Real fucking painting.
[45:44.43]For real.
[45:45.75]What do you have in mind?
[45:47.79]What is the muse telling you right now?
[45:50.87]Can you guys still hear us?
[45:52.27]The microphone's on the other side.
[45:53.63]Can you guys hear us?
[45:56.98]Can you guys actually hear us?
[46:00.16]Don't make fun of this!
[46:02.58]I understand.
[46:03.20]I'm wearing it because I don't want to get a paint in my hair.
[46:07.13]Guys, don't be fooled.
[46:08.79]Alright, so if you can hear us, great.
[46:11.65]Let's make a scene here, for real.
[46:14.49]Hopefully we're not just muffled.
[46:17.08]I'm going to use some of the, let's start with grass, right?
[46:19.08]Are we going with pencils now?
[46:20.12]We're going to do pencils for here.
[46:21.24]Alright, well, you got to get the other ones.
[46:24.62]This is going to take four hours.
[46:25.92]These are the watercolor pencils.
[46:27.28]You want the ones on this side.
[46:28.56]These are like bump heads.
[46:31.60]That's like fucking Three Stooges moments.
[46:35.79]It is, but it's funny.
[46:37.18]You guys can't hear me.
[46:39.88]Alright, let's go.
[46:44.26]We're supposed to synchronize.
[46:47.26]Get that out of the fucking goddamn way before I break it in half with my hand.
[46:50.91]This is what we're using for the painting.
[46:54.43]That's, you know, he's true, he's true, he's true.
[46:56.39]We're gonna have to cooperate this.
[46:57.49]How about this?
[46:57.97]So you use this side.
[46:59.03]Guy, we're gonna, Guy, Guy fucking...
[47:04.69]He's got two left hands.
[47:06.81]Guy pressed against glass.
[47:08.78]Guy pressed against glass.
[47:09.76]With grass.
[47:10.60]Okay.
[47:10.96]Window.
[47:11.38]Rats.
[47:12.00]Pac-Man.
[47:12.30]How are you going to color the glass, though?
[47:14.80]Because when you do, like... How do you do clear?
[47:18.88]Let's make this really easy.
[47:19.82]Clear glass.
[47:20.76]We need a setting.
[47:23.29]This is improv.
[47:23.91]We need a setting.
[47:27.87]Don't do that already.
[47:29.03]You're doing white on a white fucking canvas.
[47:33.05]Alright, so where are we?
[47:35.69]I see the mall.
[47:37.03]I see hell.
[47:38.49]On the moon.
[47:39.15]Okay, on the moon.
[47:40.89]Post office.
[47:42.13]Post office.
[47:42.69]Post office.
[47:43.07]A guy in a post office trying to get his mail.
[47:45.23]Okay?
[47:46.29]What did you do here?
[47:47.39]Store frame.
[47:48.47]I don't understand.
[47:52.32]Like, he's there.
[47:54.31]It's supposed to be an automatic door.
[47:56.29]It's after hours.
[47:57.29]It's not open anymore.
[47:59.33]So they, like, closed it and locked it, and he's trying to get out of the door.
[48:02.39]Okay.
[48:02.81]So let's go with a little bit of shade.
[48:05.20]This is the door.
[48:06.62]Whichever side.
[48:07.22]He could be over here.
[48:07.96]He could just commit to the door.
[48:09.06]You've already made us commit to having a full door here.
[48:11.38]I want to grasp it.
[48:11.80]Yeah, we got, like, a dividing line now separating this.
[48:15.13]And now we got...
[48:17.39]So here, this is... What is that?
[48:19.21]Look, look, none of this is... We can draw over this.
[48:21.67]You know when people do this?
[48:22.59]Like, you see people like that, they're artists, they go like this, they're drawing somebody, they're like... Yeah, you start with a little sketch, a couple of, you know, good.
[48:30.66]This is not gonna stay there.
[48:31.96]Now there's like another guy in the background.
[48:33.80]No, no, no, we're gonna paint over this.
[48:34.96]I'm just saying, like, we're just blocking out the scene.
[48:36.94]So guy here, his face is gonna be here.
[48:40.76]Right there, he's gonna be like fucking screaming, you know, like, get me out of the post office, why... Give us a scenario, why is he in the post office?
[48:48.54]Why is he in the post office?
[48:49.24]What's he getting?
[48:49.60]What mail is he getting?
[48:51.03]What's he getting?
[48:51.43]Is this even coming up on the... You can't even see it.
[48:58.47]Can they see what we're drawing right now?
[49:01.33]He's... He's going to mail something.
[49:03.85]He's going to mail something, okay?
[49:05.25]Why is he stuck in the door?
[49:08.15]Why is he stuck in the door?
[49:08.91]Because he's bald.
[49:12.67]Oh, fuck off.
[49:17.67]Alright, so get that out of here.
[49:20.81]What is this?
[49:22.05]What is this?
[49:22.67]In the post office, there's another guy.
[49:24.31]He's screaming for help.
[49:25.33]He wants help against the glass.
[49:27.11]No, no, no.
[49:27.95]This is a guy screaming.
[49:30.17]Fucking damn it.
[49:35.44]This is the door.
[49:37.58]Make it happen.
[49:39.12]This is the door.
[49:39.88]Hopefully, we get that brown door here.
[49:43.00]You're going to help make the door.
[49:47.34]Oh, now we're painting.
[49:48.40]Yes, we are.
[49:49.50]We've already blocked out the scene.
[49:50.44]Just don't go over the line.
[49:58.29]He had your bandana.
[50:00.71]I'm wearing the bandana because I don't want to get... I drew the bandana on him.
[50:07.58]Everybody thinks I'm fucking bald.
[50:08.94]I'm not bald.
[50:10.46]I'm wearing it because I want to get paint on me.
[50:14.08]I'll take it off if you want me to prove it.
[50:19.26]Why are you standing here, like, just judging the painting?
[50:21.76]Why don't you work on it?
[50:22.32]I'm waiting until, like, the muse speaks to me.
[50:25.16]Right now, clearly, brown is... Okay.
[50:28.68]Get a little black in there, too.
[50:31.26]I still don't know what's... I have no idea what I'm doing.
[50:33.58]Just kind of letting you have it since you're painting.
[50:38.22]You're clearly reaching across to paint on my side.
[50:41.14]Why don't you put me, like, with a gun in my hand?
[50:43.28]Like, I have to paint over that shit.
[50:45.28]Come on, man.
[50:47.52]Work with me.
[50:48.16]Creative.
[50:49.49]Here, you need some creativity?
[50:57.77]I can help this, though.
[50:59.99]Alright.
[51:00.37]I'm going to go with the original.
[51:01.59]Guy in front of glass.
[51:02.81]Alright.
[51:03.75]Make this a glass.
[51:04.33]How do we do, like, gray?
[51:05.34]Where's, like, white and black?
[51:06.64]Fucking ball.
[51:08.66]Ball.
[51:10.08]There's a white.
[51:11.34]There's a bit of white.
[51:12.04]I need to get his hands better.
[51:24.42]So that's like, bang, like 3D.
[51:25.72]What are you doing?
[51:31.48]Don't question me after this, okay?
[51:33.38]You just let me do... This is the first thing I've painted on here and I already get a, what are you doing?
[51:37.66]Like, I've done this.
[51:39.40]You, what are you doing?
[51:41.85]It's clearly, that's clearly a door.
[51:44.63]Just let me... That better not be another gun.
[51:49.09]I'm just saying, I'm just being real, that better not be a weapon.
[52:00.58]Is this the glass?
[52:01.24]It actually looks kind of good.
[52:07.82]It's a penis.
[52:08.70]It's not a penis.
[52:12.81]Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah.
[52:15.75]So he's like here.
[52:17.13]So his mouth is here, right?
[52:19.37]So his mouth is going to be pressed up against.
[52:21.01]No, no, no.
[52:21.83]Just let me do this.
[52:22.53]Let me do this.
[52:23.01]But if his mouth is going to be, like his hands are here, and his mouth is going to be pressed up against there, then we have to make that a reality, right?
[52:36.16]Watch out.
[52:38.40]Come on.
[52:40.42]So there.
[52:41.88]So that's just like... It's okay.
[52:50.42]That's okay.
[52:51.44]We're fine.
[52:51.86]Looks good.
[52:55.58]Looks alright so far.
[52:56.21]You've got to draw your eyes around that, by the way.
[52:57.73]Alright.
[52:58.63]So just get a little paint and put it on your eyes.
[53:00.57]I'm not putting paint on my eyes.
[53:01.77]It's alright.
[53:03.47]I've got some water here.
[53:04.45]Okay.
[53:06.00]We're gonna have paper towels down here.
[53:10.17]What the fuck are we doing?
[53:12.33]Oh, no, we have, we have, wait, wait, I got it.
[53:13.57]We're good, we're good, we're good, it's fine.
[53:19.81]See?
[53:21.27]We good?
[53:23.43]Yeah, just like the painting.
[53:27.26]Why is it red?
[53:30.05]It's this guy.
[53:30.69]Why did you tell me to do that?
[53:32.59]Why did you tell me to do that?
[53:34.35]You said, please make him fucking come out of the screen with like a mouth thing pressed against the glass.
[53:38.88]Why did you say that?
[53:39.90]Well, I was trying to reference back to your older paintings.
[53:42.28]Somebody fucking said that in chat and I read it and I did it.
[53:46.20]Fucking idiot.
[53:47.32]Don't fucking do that.
[53:48.46]It's not funny.
[53:49.32]Where's your older paintings?
[53:53.21]Show me your older work.
[53:54.29]Why do you want to see my older work?
[53:55.29]I want to see me and dad.
[53:58.72]I'm sensing a little inspiration here.
[54:00.16]Do you want to see me like that?
[54:03.16]Yeah.
[54:03.68]No.
[54:05.93]No, I'm not going to.
[54:08.49]No, let's get to work.
[54:10.25]So here we go.
[54:10.67]We got it.
[54:13.55]My eyes are blue.
[54:15.21]So my eyes are blue.
[54:17.54]I don't know why this turned into me.
[54:20.08]This is fucking horrible.
[54:21.26]What the fuck even is this?
[54:24.58]This is so fucking stupid.
[54:27.22]We haven't done a goddamn thing.
[54:30.06]We haven't done anything.
[54:33.24]Do dog... Dote?
[54:39.42]What is dote?
[54:40.04]Dote?
[54:40.28]I don't think anyone can even see that.
[54:46.84]Don't.
[54:47.45]Okay, don't.
[54:49.59]Eat paint.
[54:51.73]Don't dead.
[54:57.05]I don't get it.
[54:59.35]I don't understand.
[55:05.21]Don't dead.
[55:09.82]What are you trying to do?
[55:15.76]Nice meme.
[55:17.64]What meme is he making?
[55:19.53]Don't dead open.
[55:21.57]Don't open dead.
[55:23.77]Let me go wash my mouth.
[55:25.57]Get out of the way for a second.
[55:38.65]Everything's fine.
[55:41.85]Can you see?
[55:42.17]You guys can see, right?
[55:46.22]I'm just going to wash my mouth out with soap.
[55:48.00]Are we good?
[55:48.34]I'm swearing.
[55:48.92]We're good.
[55:50.96]Everything's fine, yeah.
[55:52.04]We're good.
[55:54.86]Can you see?
[55:57.08]Okay, we're good.
[55:57.42]That's fine.
[55:57.76]I'll be right back, guys.
[55:58.85]I just want to rinse this out of my face.
[56:01.39]Not because I want to, but because we're going to have to.
[56:06.29]Alright.
[56:12.54]What happened?
[56:13.52]What happened?
[56:14.18]Hold this.
[56:15.28]Hold this.
[56:18.44]God damn it, dude.
[56:20.49]Hold this right here.
[56:25.31]I can't fucking painting stream.
[56:29.17]Ah, you fucked up the whole painting stream, Alan.
[56:34.24]God damn it, Etalyx.
[56:39.07]The thing is, everyone's gonna think that that was, like, scripted.
[56:42.56]It was absolutely not.
[56:44.98]Alright, you're good.
[56:48.46]Everyone's gonna think that was on purpose.
[56:49.84]I promise you it wasn't.
[56:51.20]I gotta get the fucking paint out of my mouth.
[56:53.85]Up your right back.
[56:59.59]We're just gonna... We're just gonna put this one down over here until somebody else can come assist.
[57:12.44]There is water everywhere.
[57:13.84]There is... I'm... The good news... Come on in!
[57:21.47]Dude!
[57:24.43]What the f- Welcome to the clean-up stream.
[57:29.85]Here.
[57:30.23]No, you take this.
[57:30.79]I have to help.
[57:31.29]Here, we take the paint off of this.
[57:36.16]Welcome... Bye, guys!
[57:37.78]Bye, guys!
[57:38.02]Welcome to the unscripted clean-up stream.
[57:49.12]Wait, what are you doing?
[57:50.12]You don't have to clean.
[57:52.26]What are you cleaning?
[57:53.42]You don't have to clean.
[57:54.92]What are you talking about?
[57:55.88]I'm just getting the towels down.
[57:58.16]Where's the paper towels?
[57:59.24]They're alright here.
[58:00.31]Give me this.
[58:02.05]I feel like I'm cleaning the floor.
[58:04.15]I was just putting some... This piss was on this floor.
[58:07.11]Like, it's alright.
[58:08.97]Just putting some towels down.
[58:10.31]It looks like I've been drinking, like, green Kool-Aid for, like, the last four hours.
[58:15.82]Alright, get... Get over here.
[58:26.24]for a second.
[58:27.16]Don't open dead inside.
[58:28.96]Are you good?
[58:33.24]Are you stable?
[58:33.96]Are you good?
[58:34.91]I'm stable.
[58:36.19]Let it go.
[58:38.19]Stable.
[58:38.69]Stable.
[58:39.57]Okay.
[58:39.99]Trash bag.
[58:41.45]That's why we have the trash bag.
[58:42.49]That is why we have the trash bag.
[58:43.73]That's why we got the trash bag here.
[58:44.89]Okay, let's, um...
[58:47.33]Where were we?
[58:47.97]Where were we?
[58:48.41]We were here.
[58:49.57]We were, don't open, dead inside.
[58:50.89]That's the face.
[58:51.97]That's my face.
[58:52.75]I'm pushed up against the glass.
[58:54.59]Right.
[58:55.39]So we're going to, you're going to draw a head around there.
[58:57.13]Watch.
[58:57.45]I'll get the outline.
[58:58.40]Okay.
[58:58.68]You do the outline.
[58:59.62]I'm going to work on the rest of my sign.
[59:04.12]What?
[59:05.16]This is not a paintbrush.
[59:07.28]Alright.
[59:07.86]We need a paintbrush.
[59:09.06]What happened to your paintbrushes?
[59:12.36]They're alright there.
[59:14.16]Just below where the camera can see.
[59:15.38]We got some ecto-cooler.
[59:18.10]Alright, this is fine.
[59:21.54]So now this is actually pretty dirty.
[59:25.18]You think?
[59:25.84]It's alright.
[59:26.44]As long as it's not in my mouth.
[59:28.29]So we need like a peach.
[59:30.85]We need a new one of these.
[59:32.19]We have like five of these.
[59:33.03]Why the fuck are we still using the same one?
[59:34.95]This is fucking stupid.
[59:35.79]Apparently there's a lot of blue in this brush.
[59:39.85]That's alright.
[59:40.39]I was using those colors.
[59:42.26]Well, let's just get a new one.
[59:43.42]Get a new one.
[59:44.52]You have like two over there, don't you?
[59:47.60]Do you not have two over there?
[59:49.27]I thought we had like five.
[59:50.61]Uh... There's one.
[59:52.85]Two.
[59:53.90]There's a third one here somewhere.
[59:55.96]Well, just fucking... This is what...
[60:03.26]Mm-hmm.
[60:04.24]This is the solution to every problem.
[60:06.00]Good as new.
[60:06.72]We just had to rinse it a little bit.
[60:08.42]Yeah, just rinse it.
[60:10.22]That's fine.
[60:10.66]Yeah.
[60:10.86]Alright, so now let's keep doing this terrible fucking awful painting.
[60:14.32]Mm-hmm.
[60:15.18]You work up there.
[60:15.86]You go ahead and finish this part.
[60:16.90]Let's do yellow.
[60:17.48]It was white.
[60:18.62]Yellow and white.
[60:19.14]It was white.
[60:21.00]Yellow.
[60:21.74]Mm-hmm.
[60:22.08]Add some white.
[60:23.96]Like on top of it?
[60:24.82]Yeah, yeah.
[60:25.42]It's going to look like a peach and a little bit of red.
[60:27.34]You realize I only have this tiny squirt bottle.
[60:29.63]Well, that's okay.
[60:30.27]Just a little bit of red.
[60:32.47]Just a little bit of red.
[60:33.45]Don't do too much or I'll be upset.
[60:38.14]It's way too fucking much.
[60:42.36]It's alright.
[60:43.68]We just need like a little... My skin tone is very fair.
[60:46.78]There's a little too much yellow in here, but it's okay.
[60:52.67]We're trying to make peach and we just made mustard again.
[60:55.27]Oh, love of God.
[60:59.07]Don't even fucking matter.
[61:02.03]Okay, so let me just... I'm going to make myself look a little handsome.
[61:09.50]My chin kind of goes like that, like this.
[61:11.78]Like that.
[61:12.12]Because I've got a fucked up jaw, so that makes sense.
[61:16.40]Alright, I need the handprint so it can stay there.
[61:19.41]Let's go down like this.
[61:20.23]I've got a pretty long neck.
[61:23.91]Up to here.
[61:24.39]I'm going to continue it underneath.
[61:26.63]And I am fucking nude, you know what I mean?
[61:29.13]Wait, should I...
[61:30.42]Should I be down this far?
[61:31.61]Should I be down this far?
[61:32.19]Yeah, well, the glass and the door should be, like, covering you to some extent, so... I guess, like, this is where my brain is, okay?
[61:38.97]So, like, my, like, member is here, okay?
[61:46.47]So now we know why I'm getting in trouble at the post office, because I'm in there fucking naked.
[61:51.20]Mm-hmm.
[61:53.74]Okay.
[61:55.54]Like that.
[61:56.12]So why do you have, like, a waistline if you're naked?
[61:58.65]Because, I mean, it's just like Minecraft.
[62:01.19]We're in, like, a video game world.
[62:02.39]Oh, like, everything's blocky.
[62:03.45]Everything's a little blocky, because we're in, like, Minecraft time.
[62:06.69]Just use that as an excuse.
[62:07.63]Nobody would fucking care.
[62:10.34]So, actually, this is where, like, we need to have, like, a little... No, that's fine.
[62:13.78]That is my feet.
[62:15.46]And my shoes.
[62:19.02]Go.
[62:21.20]And then do a little bit of detail work on my face.
[62:22.74]Give me a nose.
[62:23.18]I don't have a nose.
[62:23.88]Okay.
[62:31.33]Oh wait, look at this.
[62:36.90]Can you get his look up?
[62:38.82]Can you see it?
[62:40.20]Is he inside of a mug?
[62:47.24]No, he's not supposed to be.
[62:49.20]He's not supposed to be inside of a mug.
[62:51.66]But I'm glad you picked up on that.
[62:53.80]He's just supposed to be naked and I put on a few pumps.
[62:57.06]These are my hands.
[62:57.68]We gotta go like up.
[62:59.24]I have to get better hand prints of this.
[63:01.78]Because this is supposed to be bang.
[63:05.02]Is it red?
[63:05.50]The rest of your body is yellow.
[63:07.62]But I mean, I got like blood all over my hands, right?
[63:11.57]Just a little, not that much.
[63:15.15]And then yellow.
[63:17.65]Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
[63:22.77]So if I'm...
[63:32.44]See, someone else is pushing up against the window now.
[63:36.23]Trying to get you out.
[63:37.55]No, that's like, bang, okay?
[63:39.67]Uh-huh.
[63:40.43]Fill this in a little.
[63:41.47]Yeah.
[63:43.29]That looks alright.
[63:44.11]Not that, that doesn't look terrible.
[63:47.67]Fill that in.
[63:48.13]I got, like, blood all over my hands.
[63:50.49]Don't open dead inside.
[63:51.81]Well, I don't know what that means.
[63:52.69]Why did you do... What does that mean?
[63:54.73]What does don't open dead inside mean?
[63:56.69]Just, I mean...
[63:57.75]Just a meme.
[63:58.45]So that's actually like a fucking dumb meme that you put on this painting.
[64:01.99]Mm-hmm.
[64:04.01]Chet liked it, so I don't care.
[64:11.33]Oh, now there's four hands, because you put your hands there, and you got tired, so you moved them over a little bit.
[64:15.80]Yeah, because these ones are a little bit lighter.
[64:18.78]So now we have to... Now we have to make like a sheen.
[64:24.40]Why don't you just wipe it down on the canvas?
[64:27.70]That's a good idea.
[64:28.42]That's a bad idea.
[64:31.16]Oh dear.
[64:32.10]I'll hold this side.
[64:33.20]Make sure it doesn't fall.
[64:37.70]It's actually not a bad idea.
[64:38.78]It's going to work pretty well.
[64:45.78]That's alright.
[64:49.97]Okay.
[64:51.55]You couldn't fucking hold... You couldn't...
[64:58.06]That's a real disaster.
[65:00.22]That's an actual disaster.
[65:01.48]Look, that wasn't me.
[65:02.22]That whole thing fucking dumped over.
[65:03.81]That wasn't me, though.
[65:04.51]Pick it up.
[65:04.99]Just pick it up.
[65:06.28]No, we are actually dealing with a real disaster.
[65:08.82]That's the computer.
[65:11.24]That's the computer over there.
[65:12.74]See where that fell?
[65:13.82]That's the computer.
[65:15.04]That went inside the fucking computer.
[65:18.03]In the fucking computer.
[65:19.95]I would just like to point out that it wasn't the painting that knocked it over.
[65:23.01]It was the... Okay, this one's done.
[65:26.43]This one's done.
[65:27.25]We're done.
[65:27.91]Hey, listen, we need a little history here.
[65:29.81]We're done.
[65:30.23]Alright, a little history.
[65:31.37]This one...
[65:33.01]I want you all to look at the, what are these called?
[65:36.39]The stand that I built.
[65:38.37]Okay, Standing Strong.
[65:40.09]And this is the one that Jerma built.
[65:43.63]And I want you all to look at a very important part about its leg here in particular.
[65:48.67]Get this out of the way.
[65:49.63]We're doing my magnum opus.
[65:52.55]Get it out of the way.
[65:53.05]That ain't supposed to happen.
[65:54.15]Alright, here's my magnum opus.
[65:57.88]Get this shit out of the way.
[65:59.20]Point the camera down to the ground.
[66:00.14]Look at its legs.
[66:01.00]It don't matter.
[66:01.64]Who cares?
[66:02.24]I fucking made that one today, but I was under stress.
[66:06.16]Magnum Opus time.
[66:10.67]Get this out of the way.
[66:11.49]It was only a matter of time.
[66:13.13]It was only a matter of time.
[66:13.89]There's already shit all over this one, but it's okay.
[66:15.63]So here's... This one's huge.
[66:18.11]Lay it down flat.
[66:20.05]Like this.
[66:20.69]Okay.
[66:23.27]Hand the camera down, please.
[66:25.49]This is my magnum fucking opus, okay?
[66:28.09]For those of you that want to know what this is, check this out.
[66:32.10]Hold on, sorry about your ears.
[66:42.64]I call, I call this one crime scene.
[66:58.00]Are you gonna do it?
[66:59.05]What?
[67:00.77]Uh... Okay.
[67:07.39]Not paint!
[67:10.45]Wait, not paint?
[67:11.55]What, are you gonna get it all over me?
[67:15.66]I thought that was the idea.
[67:16.86]Trace me.
[67:17.54]Trace me with a fucking marker or pen.
[67:20.84]Oh, remember the red pen from earlier.
[67:22.46]No, it's got to be black.
[67:24.68]But you're bloody, so we do the blood first.
[67:27.36]No, alright.
[67:28.22]Do the blood first.
[67:28.72]Do it.
[67:29.00]Is this black?
[67:32.24]Can you see my ass?
[67:33.42]I hope not.
[67:34.10]No.
[67:35.96]Is this it?
[67:37.16]I don't know.
[67:37.52]Is it?
[67:41.93]Okay, so you guys aren't doing it with paint.
[67:43.91]Alright, this one's kind of red.
[67:45.21]This is a maroon.
[67:46.13]As long as you get it, just get it.
[67:47.43]I'm going to sell this for fucking $400,000.
[67:50.53]What is going on?
[67:51.41]Who's next to me?
[67:52.90]I'm just tucking in here.
[67:56.36]Alright, are you ready?
[67:56.94]Hold still.
[67:57.54]I'm ready.
[67:58.32]Alright, ready?
[67:59.08]Do it.
[68:06.28]You better get this right.
[68:07.16]Get every detail.
[68:17.81]And why don't you pull off the fucking thing on my head after you do this to make sure everyone knows I'm not actually bald.
[68:22.38]Wait, after or before?
[68:23.70]Do it after.
[68:24.14]Wait, no, no, no.
[68:24.98]Do it now because I don't want to get anything on that scarf.
[68:28.92]Coming off.
[68:29.32]See?
[68:30.18]Not bald, ladies and gentlemen.
[68:32.15]What if I was wearing a bald cap?
[68:35.07]Alright.
[68:35.35]Hold your head still.
[68:36.05]Wait, what do you mean still?
[68:37.01]What do you got there?
[68:37.87]Is it a marker?
[68:38.61]Yeah.
[68:39.23]Don't color my fucking... You just colored my fucking hair.
[68:53.00]Alright, the only thing left, uh, which we can imagine is, is, uh, down here.
[69:02.95]Call this one.
[69:05.79]Call this one.
[69:08.55]Crime scene.
[69:12.13]Yep.
[69:13.95]The chin.
[69:16.53]The chin.
[69:19.32]I'll see you on fucking eBay for 10 grand.
[69:22.08]Oh, we gotta get some blood on there, though.
[69:23.95]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:25.11]Now we have to, like... This one's done.
[69:28.19]No, that's done.
[69:28.81]That's minimalistic.
[69:29.55]It's over.
[69:29.89]That one's done.
[69:30.97]Alright, I just... I just, like... Okay, good thing this wasn't open, otherwise it would have squirted all over the fucking ground.
[69:43.22]What does my hair even look like?
[69:44.50]Do I look like a fucking idiot?
[69:46.45]Probably.
[69:47.17]Well, I mean, your hands are completely red, so... Alright, so we got one more painting for you.
[69:52.24]Okay.
[69:57.32]I call this one... The Serial Killer Did It Again!
[70:02.82]It's you again?
[70:06.75]Okay.
[70:13.55]What do you want out of this one?
[70:16.78]You're supposed to be the artist.
[70:18.58]You're just laying there.
[70:19.98]That one, the last one was my art that I drew.
[70:23.08]You were laying down.
[70:24.22]That's my fucking art.
[70:25.80]That's my art.
[70:26.64]But I drew it.
[70:27.88]It doesn't matter.
[70:28.40]It was my fucking genius idea.
[70:31.42]Crime scene.
[70:32.24]Serial killer.
[70:34.66]All of these are going to be fucking in a line, right?
[70:36.53]Imagine like in a line, like four of these.
[70:38.55]I have to fucking use him a fine art in New York City.
[70:41.45]Yeah, this one, isn't it my turn?
[70:42.61]You know what that means.
[70:49.24]How much did you pay for these canvases?
[70:51.62]A lot of fucking money.
[70:53.28]Alright, so you've got to do it again.
[70:54.62]But this time I've got to be in a different position.
[70:57.04]Okay.
[70:57.30]Like facing down.
[70:58.30]Okay.
[70:59.40]If that's what the artist sees.
[71:01.90]Remove his pants.
[71:03.26]I don't fucking think so.
[71:05.26]Alright, this time I'm going to be like this.
[71:07.16]Same medium?
[71:07.90]You want the marker again?
[71:09.48]Yes.
[71:10.28]Okay.
[71:12.75]Then we're going to color in his face.
[71:15.09]Okay.
[71:19.35]Here we go again.
[71:20.11]Do this one quick.
[71:22.05]Quick?
[71:22.49]Mm-hmm.
[71:22.91]Okay.
[71:23.43]Hold still.
[71:24.20]Ready?
[71:24.40]Mm-hmm.
[71:35.24]Come on.
[71:35.48]Put some fucking passion.
[71:36.48]Put some passion in it.
[71:38.00]Expression, dude.
[71:39.28]Give me a break.
[71:40.30]This is not very expressive.
[71:44.87]Up with the neck.
[71:45.29]The neck.
[71:45.55]The neck.
[71:45.83]You missed the neck.
[71:46.39]Come on.
[71:46.61]This is going to be fucking on eBay for a million dollars.
[71:56.46]It's your intestines?
[71:57.80]Yep.
[71:58.54]Looks good.
[72:00.86]Looks good.
[72:02.98]Call this next one the final painting.
[72:11.37]This last painting is going to be called
[72:21.09]This last one's gonna be called Professional Cleaning Job.
[72:24.29]This is what this last one's gonna be called.
[72:28.41]This last one's gonna be called Consumerism.
[72:32.79]Fucking Christmas, huh?
[72:34.41]Christmas time?
[72:35.91]Oh, Christmas, huh?
[72:38.09]Consumerism overspending.
[72:40.78]Overconsuming.
[72:43.96]Cookies, candies, presents, Santa Claus.
[72:47.63]It's a lot of fucking nonsense.
[72:49.69]It's bullshit.
[72:50.93]It's bullshit.
[72:51.71]You know what I mean?
[72:52.41]I don't even care.
[72:55.39]Get some sprinkles.
[72:56.05]Get some frosting on it.
[72:57.69]Oh, look.
[72:58.05]Consumerism.
[72:59.41]Oh, I want a new iPad, Mom.
[73:01.13]I want a new iPad, Mommy.
[73:03.21]And look at that.
[73:05.13]That's the iPad.
[73:12.85]Here we go.
[73:13.39]And then, to top it all off, we're gonna put on the fucking- Yeah, you wanna talk about what expensive shit that we buy on the holidays?
[73:20.98]Oh, look at that!
[73:21.90]Da da da da da da da da da!
[73:24.80]New fucking Star Wars movie coming out!
[73:27.48]New Star Wars movie!
[73:29.50]Gotta buy that too, alright guys?
[73:33.02]Un-fucking-believable.
[73:33.86]Hey, guess what?
[73:37.09]Art is dead.
[73:38.47]Art is fucking dead.
[73:40.51]Art is dead.
[73:49.25]Hey, thanks for watching.
[73:56.25]I came here to clean this up.
[73:58.91]I came here to help clean this up.
[74:02.23]And then, to top it all off, the final piece of the puzzle.
[74:06.84]The last piece.
[74:08.40]That's how you know it was real.
[74:10.78]I'm gonna need quite a little bit of this.
[74:14.72]This is InstaClean from Woolite.
[74:18.36]Woolite.
[74:19.90]Your biggest mess can be your brightest future.
[74:22.48]I'm going to be cleaning this up for the next four days.
[74:24.16]It can be used if you have a pesky pet.
[74:27.12]Paint.
[74:28.74]Any kinds of problems that you have with stains or wine or paint.
[74:34.78]Or if you get paint on something.
[74:37.06]You can very easily clean it up with Woolite.
[74:39.54]InstaClean Oxy.
[74:40.66]Pet stain distortions.
[74:42.50]Pet stain distortions, as you can see.
[74:44.14]Look, it even has...
[74:50.21]As you can see, it has the little bristles here.
[74:52.42]In case some cat shit gets in the ground, you can easily scrape it out.
[74:55.44]As you can see, we've already... We've already used it a little bit.
[74:58.00]Yeah, we can verify.
[74:59.15]We can verify.
[75:01.95]Consumerism!
[75:05.47]That's how you deal with fucking consumerism!
[75:08.54]Squeak it clean.
[75:19.80]Alright.
[75:20.90]Goodbye.
[75:22.42]Thanks for watching the stream, everybody.
[75:24.28]Closing the door on this one now.
[75:27.46]Close the door on that one.
[75:32.14]What did you do?
[75:32.70]Why would you?
[75:33.16]No, honest to God, why did you do that?
[75:34.62]No, that one.
[75:36.39]What are you doing?
[75:37.39]What the fuck?
[75:38.05]Why did you do that?
[75:38.85]I ain't cleaning none of this up.
[75:41.21]I'm going home on the airplane right now.
[75:46.33]That was not supposed to... Okay, that was like completely uncalled for.
[75:48.83]He didn't need to do that at all.
[75:52.35]Why would you do that?
[75:54.87]It's not even his fucking house.
[76:00.01]That was not actually... But he actually just did that to be funny.
[76:03.79]That was funny.
[76:07.67]I'll see you in like three weeks after this room is fucking cleaned.
[76:14.39]Ay-yi-yi.
[76:17.05]Hey, welcome to Jerma High Five, where we just, like, destroy shit on stream.
[76:22.53]Hey, A-plus content, guys.
[76:24.54]Ay-yi-yi.
[76:31.82]That's like, hey, remember when I broke the fucking computer?
[76:39.26]Alright, good... Let's go ahead and... Let's go ahead and say goodbye.
[76:43.84]Goodbye.
[76:45.34]And nothing... The computer is fine.
[76:46.92]The computer is not harmed at all.
[76:52.91]You're like sneaking back in here.
[76:54.45]Get out of here.
[76:59.13]Goodnight, guys.
[77:01.21]Goodnight.
[77:02.01]Goodbye.
[77:03.09]Thanks for watching the Paystream.
[77:04.05]See you next time.
[77:05.29]We missed a lot of subs and bits and stuff, but obviously there's a...
[77:09.22]A lot more going on in this room.
[77:11.48]Hey, and by the way, maybe check in like next week.
[77:14.14]Maybe next time when I destroy more shit in my fucking house.
[77:17.38]Hey, A+.
[77:17.84]Take it easy, guys.
[77:20.58]Thanks for watching.
[77:22.67]Much love.
[77:23.37]Good night.
[77:23.81]Goodbye.
[77:25.07]Sayonara.
[77:25.79]See you later.
[77:27.15]Take care.
