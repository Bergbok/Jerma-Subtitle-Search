[00:00.99]Okay, so here are the costumes for all the classes.
[00:04.10]Hopefully you guys enjoy this.
[00:05.60]Some of these are hysterical.
[00:07.06]We're going to start with the Scout.
[00:08.48]The Scout is the Curse of Nature.
[00:11.00]It's a set, three pieces, one hat, and two miscellaneous items.
[00:14.58]You start with the Rat Battler, which is kind of like a mummy hat over his eyes.
[00:18.90]The ba-onk, the bonk, which is a arm wrap and a little onk symbol for the necklace.
[00:26.11]And the futa, oh my god, how can I pronounce this?
[00:29.91]The futankuman, or whatever you pronounce it.
[00:32.17]So it's kind of like a mummy set up for the scout.
[00:34.43]Looks pretty funny.
[00:35.31]And he got a new melee weapon, the unarmed combat.
[00:38.83]Don't think it does anything.
[00:40.31]It's just kind of a reskin of the bat, but it still looks pretty funny.
[00:45.03]It's some dude's arm.
[00:47.06]All right, now let's move on to the soldier.
[00:48.84]The soldier got a... Oh, this is awesome.
[00:50.88]I love this so much.
[00:52.58]This is the tin soldier, and the hat is the idiot box, which is kind of this robot head.
[00:59.25]These really crappy steel pipes for his arms, and these shoestrings that look like little box shoes.
[01:05.55]I think it looks hilarious.
[01:06.65]It's going to be so funny watching people running around with this.
[01:09.73]Now the Pyro.
[01:10.39]The Pyro got this demon set up.
[01:12.69]This is really, really cool.
[01:13.83]I like this one a lot.
[01:15.29]The Blazing Bull.
[01:16.17]It's called the Infernal Imp is the name of the set.
[01:19.03]The Blazing Bull for the head.
[01:21.51]Fallen Angel for the wings.
[01:23.59]And the second secondary is Tail from the Crypt.
[01:26.19]He has a tail.
[01:27.35]So out of his little compression thing here.
[01:30.22]This is so funny.
[01:32.09]All right, let's move on to the Demoman.
[01:34.70]The Demoman kind of got like a werewolf setup.
[01:36.82]Look at this face.
[01:37.70]It's ridiculous.
[01:39.14]So it's called the Highland Hound, and the hat is the hair of the dog.
[01:44.68]The first miscellaneous is the Scottish Snarl, which is kind of the face.
[01:49.16]And look at the paws.
[01:50.36]These are great.
[01:50.86]The pickled paws.
[01:52.38]Kind of see some werewolf Demoman running around.
[01:54.78]Pretty ridiculous.
[01:57.10]Let's move on to the Heavy.
[01:58.30]The Heavy is kind of a letdown, to be honest.
[02:01.34]I guess it's okay.
[02:02.62]But it's a Frankenstein sort of remake, I guess.
[02:05.90]The name of the set is the Franken-Heavy.
[02:08.62]The can opener is the head.
[02:10.52]The steel-toed stoppers is one of the miscellaneous.
[02:13.00]And the second miscellaneous is the Soviet stitch-up.
[02:15.92]So it's kind of like a Frankenstein monster kind of thing with the brain coming out here in the end.
[02:21.23]It's cool, I guess.
[02:22.83]A little kind of on the... Like I said, I'm...
[02:25.37]Not really too happy about it, but whatever.
[02:27.73]It's cool.
[02:29.20]This is the by far best one in the entire update.
[02:33.22]This is the engineers.
[02:34.29]He got a bug fly update.
[02:36.37]Oh, God, this is so funny.
[02:38.29]The name of it is the Brundle Bundle.
[02:40.85]The buzz killer, which is this fly face mask thing, which is hysterical.
[02:46.61]Fly wings as one miscellaneous and the fly feet as another one.
[02:50.16]I love this.
[02:51.06]I hope that they don't take this off.
[02:53.26]I hope they allow you to keep this because it can get... Oh, I can't believe it.
[02:56.22]It's so funny.
[02:57.90]The medic is another one of the really funny ones.
[03:00.26]Take a look at this.
[03:03.96]This is called the mad doctor, as I'm sure you could assume.
[03:07.60]The head is the Einstein, the Emerald Jurati, and the Dr. Googlestash is the other miscellaneous.
[03:14.94]Very, very funny stuff.
[03:16.27]This is great.
[03:18.87]Let's move on now.
[03:19.67]The sniper is also a little bit on the somewhat lame side.
[03:23.35]The hat is pretty cool.
[03:24.79]The Holy Hunter.
[03:25.63]The name of the set is the Camper Van Helsing.
[03:29.29]And it's pretty funny.
[03:30.85]The hat is... It's got this little symbol up here.
[03:33.05]It's a nice little... I like the hat.
[03:34.97]It's pretty cool looking.
[03:36.80]Garlic flank steak.
[03:37.92]It's the miscellaneous.
[03:38.74]It's kind of hanging on the sides here.
[03:40.02]The garlic and the little knife.
[03:41.68]And silver bullets up here.
[03:43.86]Kind of wish they did a little more with it, but it's still interesting.
[03:47.06]I still think it's great.
[03:48.52]The spy is also really interesting.
[03:50.38]Look at this.
[03:50.74]He looks like a sand raider.
[03:52.54]The name of this one is the invisible rogue.
[03:55.14]So it's like the invisible man.
[03:56.40]I think he looks like a sand raider.
[03:58.40]The undercover is the hat.
[04:00.26]The intangible ascot, ascot, however you say that, is one of the miscellaneous.
[04:05.49]And the goggles, the griffin's gogg, are the second...
[04:08.73]So you can collect these all from the new map that is updated.
[04:12.79]It is Ioduct.
[04:14.13]We're going to take a look at that right now.
[04:15.95]And you get them in the cauldron when you first log on.
[04:18.21]You can get one of these in the cauldron.
[04:20.15]So let's move on to the new map and the new monster.
[04:25.07]Okay, so here we are on Ayaduct.
[04:27.10]This is not Viaduct.
[04:28.54]It might look like Viaduct, but it's kind of a reskin of Viaduct.
[04:32.62]They took Viaduct and made it Haunted.
[04:35.50]Haunted Viaduct.
[04:37.26]And if you're wondering, in the top part of the screen, that is the new boss's health.
[04:42.34]The new boss is this thing right here, this giant floating eyeball, the Monoculus, the Monoculus, whatever you want to say, however you want to pronounce it.
[04:50.64]When he dies, he opens up a portal that you can go into, if my understanding is correct, and I think the nearest few people, or maybe somebody that got the last hit on him, I'm not sure, but I end up getting the last hit on him here, as you'll see.
[05:05.19]Not really sure, gonna try and find that out later on in the next couple of days, but you'll see what happens, he has almost no health,
[05:11.61]Also forgot to mention, I want to say the new Spy Knife is just a reskin of the Eternal Reward.
[05:17.10]No biggie, forgot to mention that earlier, wanted to bring that up.
[05:19.64]So there's the last hit right there, he just exploded, let's go into this new crazy world.
[05:25.10]Nobody wanted to shoot each other, I was kind of shooting this guy and then I was thinking, wait a minute, maybe we should just see what's going on here.
[05:31.04]This little gate runs down and whoever picks it up, I think maybe everybody gets it.
[05:35.94]I'm not sure.
[05:36.92]I believe maybe only one or two people can get it.
[05:39.33]Then once you get it, you turn into Psycho Mode, Ubered and Kritzkrieged, and you can just kill everybody.
[05:45.11]This was just so confusing to me.
[05:46.33]I was like, what is going on?
[05:48.17]But that is kind of the update, and then once I die, you will see the items that I got for completing that.
[05:53.28]Two achievements, guys.
[05:54.24]You can get them.
[05:55.20]And one of the new items you can get is this thing right here, the Bombinomicon.
[05:59.66]That's a new mask.
[06:00.52]The binoculars is a new mask.
[06:02.52]And this thing explodes spontaneously on death.
[06:05.78]Not really sure what that does, but maybe it kills people that you blow up near.
[06:09.59]Thank you all so much for watching.
[06:11.07]I really appreciate it.
[06:12.33]Go have fun with this new update.
[06:13.77]There's a couple of things I didn't get to cover, but I tried to get most of it in one video.
[06:18.17]Thank you guys so much.
[06:19.11]I'll see you all next time, and take care, everybody.
