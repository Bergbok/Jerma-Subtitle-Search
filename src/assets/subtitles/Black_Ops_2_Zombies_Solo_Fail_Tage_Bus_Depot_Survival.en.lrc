[00:08.50]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.13]Jerma here with some more Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
[00:13.81]Now, this is the zombies mode in Black Ops 2.
[00:16.05]This actually was very heavily requested that I do this, especially on transit and especially by myself.
[00:22.67]So this is a solo run.
[00:23.65]I'm going to do the transit mode like you're seeing.
[00:25.85]And I have no idea what's going on, by the way.
[00:28.08]This is the first time I've ever...
[00:30.28]Ever played Call of Duty Black Ops Zombies.
[00:32.82]Ever.
[00:33.52]Never.
[00:33.94]Never done this.
[00:34.44]Never.
[00:34.80]So I have no idea what's going to happen.
[00:36.32]All I know is I'm supposed to shoot these zombies.
[00:38.72]And win.
[00:40.21]So we're going to go with that.
[00:41.25]I don't know what to do.
[00:43.35]I've seen a couple videos on that.
[00:45.71]What the hell is that?
[00:47.63]What?
[00:48.65]What, there's like power-ups in this mode?
[00:51.03]Cool.
[00:52.42]Probably have limited ammo.
[00:53.42]I probably shouldn't just be shooting like six bullets at a time.
[00:56.24]But let's hope I don't screw this up.
[00:59.67]Black Ops 2 zombies!
[01:01.75]Whatever this is, I'm buying it.
[01:05.47]Sweet.
[01:06.99]So now what, do we just like wait around and just like sit around?
[01:10.30]Whatever, I can do that.
[01:11.96]Oh, power-up's running out!
[01:12.98]Power-up's running out!
[01:14.08]I gotta find somebody to shoot!
[01:15.04]Power-up!
[01:15.46]Oh!
[01:15.72]My power-up's blinkin'!
[01:17.52]Blinkin' like an old Super Nintendo boss.
[01:20.44]Well, come on in!
[01:24.62]Come on in, zombies!
[01:26.70]There's a one-head shot.
[01:29.76]What?
[01:30.39]What?
[01:31.91]That's it?
[01:32.95]I just lost.
[01:35.09]I just lost.
[01:38.39]I just lost right there.
[01:39.85]I got hit.
[01:40.31]Oh my god, that was terrible.
[01:44.55]Oh, rebuild, rebuild.
[01:47.27]Make sure there's nobody behind me, man.
[01:48.69]I feel like I'm playing The Sims.
[01:52.65]It's like the same buying noise.
[01:53.87]You buy like a sofa.
[01:59.14]Alright, am I missing something here or no?
[02:01.30]It's just slow at first.
[02:05.57]Anybody else out here?
[02:07.49]Which one of you zombie pricks want to take it to the face?
[02:13.45]Rebuild.
[02:14.73]No!
[02:15.25]No!
[02:15.53]What?
[02:15.87]No!
[02:16.11]Where did that guy even come from?
[02:31.99]Jeopardy, baby, beatbox edition.
[02:33.74]Where are the enemies?
[02:36.28]Oh, cool, you spawned like an enemy.
[02:38.66]Oh, you're on fire.
[02:39.48]Alright, I'm going to change position here.
[02:44.38]Oh, what?
[02:44.72]What?
[02:45.18]Where did you... That lady just came out of nowhere.
[02:47.15]Did they spawn behind you?
[02:49.21]They spawned behind you!
[02:52.15]I'm going to lose!
[02:54.73]I'm going to lose!
[02:55.11]I'm on fire!
[02:57.80]No, wait!
[02:58.68]Wait, time out!
[02:59.52]Grenade!
[03:00.30]Oh, eat grenades!
[03:01.34]Everybody eat a grenade!
[03:02.63]Oh, Jesus!
[03:05.11]I'm still alive!
[03:07.53]Oh, my God, what's happening?
[03:10.91]Okay, that was insane.
[03:16.93]They spawn behind you!
[03:20.86]Ugh!
[03:23.40]You know what happened?
[03:24.46]Once I moved from my little area over here, it got crazy.
[03:29.31]Like, I ain't moving from this spot again.
[03:31.87]I can promise you that.
[03:33.35]Anyone behind me?
[03:34.77]Get away from my spot!
[03:35.73]Get away from my little area!
[03:39.33]Oh, no, wait!
[03:40.45]Wait, I'm not ready!
[03:41.31]I'm not ready yet!
[03:42.05]I'm not ready for this!
[03:43.39]Get away from me!
[03:47.30]So after the three fails in a row, I think I finally figured it out.
[03:51.83]And we're going to try and go for gold here.
[03:54.76]And by gold, I want to at least make it to, like, wave five.
[03:57.68]Okay?
[03:58.68]I'll be, like, happy if I make it to, like, wave five or six or something.
[04:02.54]I just can't keep dying at, like, wave two.
[04:06.20]Alright, we're at wave four.
[04:08.74]Where is this guy?
[04:09.30]Where is this guy?
[04:14.14]I got some bullets.
[04:15.04]I'll be okay.
[04:17.18]Wave four.
[04:17.87]Oh, there they are.
[04:18.67]There they are.
[04:20.67]See ya.
[04:23.83]I don't really want a hug.
[04:24.95]You can take that out of here.
[04:27.68]You bastard.
[04:29.40]Do I have enough money for the SMG?
[04:32.48]I think that's an SMG.
[04:34.26]Pretty sure it is.
[04:34.88]Let's go get it.
[04:35.96]Times two.
[04:36.62]What?
[04:37.34]Oh, times two?
[04:38.34]Oh!
[04:40.44]Get exploded!
[04:41.90]Wow, they're coming in fast.
[04:42.96]Coming in hot.
[04:43.74]Coming in hot.
[04:44.80]Coming in hot!
[04:45.56]Coming in hot!
[04:46.54]Jump over!
[04:47.56]No!
[04:49.79]Not screwing this up again.
[04:51.64]You're not gonna, like, take this from me.
[04:53.16]I'm getting to wave 5.
[04:54.50]You understand that?
[04:55.34]You understand that, lady?
[04:56.64]I'm getting to wave 5 right now.
[04:59.10]And I'm gonna be the master of Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
[05:03.68]Again, this would be so much easier with, like, another person.
[05:06.90]Because you could all, like... You could, like, talk to each other and know what's happening and know where you're going.
[05:11.08]And this is a bad place for me to be right now, for sure.
[05:13.70]Yeah, I just killed myself, I think.
[05:15.53]I need to be very, very, very... Oh!
[05:22.45]Oh no!
[05:23.53]I'm so- Oh my god!
[05:24.73]Just- Eye of the Tiger.
[05:25.71]Eye of the Tiger.
[05:26.57]I got out.
[05:27.49]I used Eye of the Tiger and I got out.
[05:29.25]Can you believe it?
[05:31.03]Yeah.
[05:31.49]Everyone right there is done.
[05:35.60]Eye of the Tiger.
[05:38.86]That's not crawling!
[05:41.00]At least I got to wave five.
[05:44.78]That's all I wanted was to get to wave five.
[05:48.52]At least I- Oh man.
[05:53.51]Well, thank you for watching, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:56.24]I hope you enjoyed my Black Ops 2 profe- Ow, my elbow.
[06:01.22]Professional Black Ops 2 zombies with German 985.
[06:04.64]Make sure to like and favorite the video because of how awesome I did.
[06:07.22]No, but seriously, guys.
[06:10.56]Thank you for watching.
[06:11.16]I'll see you all soon.
[06:12.59]Maybe I'll try this again with a different person so it's not just me getting my ass kicked over and over again.
[06:18.07]But yeah, thanks for watching.
[06:19.23]I'll see you all soon.
[06:20.27]And take care, everybody.
[06:22.11]Damn it!
