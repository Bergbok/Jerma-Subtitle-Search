[00:27.44]That's a good start.
[00:28.24]Anyways.
[00:30.12]Starting a little late today.
[00:32.29]The plan originally was we were going to do... Keep talking and everybody will be whatever.
[00:38.95]Keep talking and nobody explodes.
[00:40.93]With Joel, but Joel's not feeling well.
[00:44.09]He kind of last second was like, I'm sorry to do that.
[00:46.29]I feel like shit right now.
[00:47.59]And I'm like, don't.
[00:48.25]It's all good.
[00:48.93]Don't fucking worry about it.
[00:49.94]It's all good.
[00:50.34]We're just going to do it tomorrow.
[00:53.52]So today...
[00:55.95]Today, we're going to do something else.
[00:59.76]And what we're going to do is, um, I've got a lot of games to play.
[01:04.58]I've got a huge list over the last couple of days at least.
[01:07.72]I've been compiling at least what I want to start to do in 2020.
[01:13.35]Derma Falls on stream.
[01:14.39]Yeah.
[01:14.57]And I also, I've looked at the images.
[01:17.67]I've seen the images of the everyone that like weird mutant face that I have when I'm in the chair.
[01:25.50]I know, it looks doctored, but it isn't, but it... It looks bad.
[01:31.48]uh I know I know I've seen it anyways um we don't have to I because we're starting really late so I want to kind of get right into this so here comes the game this is uh this is flashing lights is the game uh this actually was requested uh more than once this is a requested video game this is a game we play as police ambulance and fire
[01:59.34]No, not like, not actual flashing lights.

[02:04.88]This was requested twice.
[02:06.42]I don't, I have no, I saw the screenshots, I saw like a few seconds of the trailer, and I'm like, okay.
[02:16.57]Fine.
[02:17.53]Alright.
[02:18.35]I'll give it a try.
[02:22.07]I'll give it a try.
[02:25.14]If this game is not... I got two other last-minute additions that should be fun.
[02:32.45]We did a poll earlier, and this is what was voted for.
[02:35.83]Again, 2020 is going to be no different.
[02:38.55]I'm going to make this really, really clear.
[02:40.92]The power of the pre-stream chat, this got like 70% of the vote.
[02:46.84]And if you want to know what it beat out, it beat out Katana Zero and Wizorb.
[02:53.33]Just saying.
[02:53.97]The power of the pre-stream chat.
[02:55.69]Don't think you don't have power.
[03:00.97]Somebody just wrote, seriously?
[03:04.03]Seriously?
[03:07.39]Anyways, let's go.

[15:55.21]He just, it just, like, jumped on him.
[15:56.51]So... Uh, we're gonna do it tomorrow.
[16:02.97]Joel's health is more important...
[16:06.02]than defusing fake bombs.
[16:16.43]Seriously, why do I have to go all the way around here?
[16:18.95]Is there no better way for me to go?
[16:25.51]He just tried to hit me.
[16:32.03]This is the worst emergency route ever.
[16:34.51]Why is there not an emergency route?
[16:46.27]Multi-lane driving?
[16:47.51]No, shouldn't there be like a road that's... Wait, this is the wrong way.
[16:52.98]Alright, what's the other siren?

[18:08.08]Imagine... Imagine you got in a car accident.
[18:12.10]And... You look down.
[18:14.14]You got like a broken leg.
[18:16.24]And you look down the... All the way down here.
[18:18.70]And you see the medic and EMT running up the hill with a bag...
[18:26.30]How disappointed would you be?
[18:31.22]And you look even further down and you see that he drove into a ditch.
[18:33.96]Alright, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
[18:35.40]How's the patient?

[20:56.75]Not that I'm aware of.
[21:07.92]Can I get the car?
[21:08.58]I think I can get the car out of the ditch.
[21:10.51]I think I can move it.
[21:17.22]Yeah, I think somebody just mentioned it.
[21:18.30]Why is there a jump even programmed into the game?

[23:23.37]Hold on.
[23:27.57]Is he alive?
[23:28.79]No pulse.
[23:43.27]I killed him.
[23:49.53]Patient's not ready for transportation.
[23:51.15]Wait, hold on.
[23:53.20]Didn't he just have a pulse?
[23:58.28]Look, see?
[24:13.22]The patient's not ready for transportation.
[24:16.54]Do I have to have the stretcher?
[24:28.89]Where is the stretcher?
[24:29.65]Back here?
[24:36.98]It's not that far.
[24:46.33]You have to put his clothes back on.
[24:51.45]Why is it so hard for me to drive over this road?
[24:56.50]Where's the stretcher?
[24:57.20]Isn't it right here?
[24:57.82]It was right here!
[24:58.48]There it is.
[25:05.31]Another $50 from Phylactery?
[25:07.91]Holy shit, Phylactery.
[25:10.25]Really?
[25:10.59]Oh my god.
[25:14.27]Get boots.
[25:15.95]Alright, put that in.
[25:16.63]Let's go.
[25:22.79]Alright, get over here.
[25:23.57]I'm just learning.
[25:25.13]I'm learning how to play.
[25:40.28]Please don't do this again.
[25:43.24]Move!
[25:45.30]Bro, you need to learn how to read.
[25:47.58]No, I don't.
[25:50.56]Speaking of reading.
[25:51.80]Five community subs.
[25:52.76]I can read that from Flinzenberg.
[25:57.72]Thank you, Flinzenberg, for the five subs.
[25:59.20]And Volemi for the... There's more money coming in.
[26:03.80]Hold on.
[26:04.48]Hold on.
[26:04.88]Hold on.
[26:06.06]There's a shitload of money coming in.
[26:08.92]You guys didn't stop from New Year's Eve.
[26:10.94]Oh my goodness.
[26:12.30]You can only read greed.
[26:14.86]It's not true.
[26:17.06]5,000 fucking bits from Vilemi.
[26:19.57]Jeremiah, if I'm ever dying, I hope to God you're not the EMT that responds to my 911 call.
[26:23.17]Well, I wouldn't because I'm not an EMT.
[26:26.33]I'm an internet clown.
[26:28.45]And now that would be odd if an internet clown had to come and take care of you.
[26:42.32]How do I fill up gas?
[26:46.92]Another five community subs from AdventureMFDan.
[26:55.51]Where's the gas?
[26:56.13]In an emergency vehicle, where's the gas?
[26:58.37]Wrong side?
[27:00.25]Shit, it's the wrong side.
[27:01.31]Whatever, whatever.
[27:01.83]I don't need it right now.
[27:05.02]There's a guy lying on the ground, dying.
[27:06.94]I'm going.
[27:08.16]Had to test.
[27:13.82]$2.45 for gas.
[27:14.54]That's pretty cheap.
[27:17.90]He's not dead.
[27:18.62]He's gonna be fine.
[27:19.36]Flutter's 10 community subs.
[27:23.02]Holy shit, guys.
[27:24.00]Thank you.
[27:25.28]More subs.
[27:25.92]Alright, I'm here.
[27:30.85]Look, there was no real tutorial.
[27:32.33]I'm trying to figure it out as we go.
[27:34.89]Drive on the roads.
[27:36.01]It's too much Grand Theft Auto in my blood.
[27:39.97]Okay.
[27:41.27]I have the stretcher now.
[27:45.15]Stretcher.
[27:46.89]Let's get it.
[27:47.33]Alright, I just, like, caused an injury to somebody else.
[27:50.63]Phylactery, what on earth are you doing, man?
[27:54.31]Phylactery, 60 fucking 9 subs.
[27:56.59]What are you doing?
[27:58.63]Holy fuck, dude.
[28:02.71]Hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[28:04.77]Hundreds.
[28:05.99]Alright, I gotta... That's a lot of subs.
[28:09.15]69 fucking community subs.
[28:11.89]Alright, how do I put you on the stretcher?
[28:14.21]I have an indicator, but I can't do anything about it.
[28:20.59]Jeremy, you need to buy phylactery dinner at this point.
[28:23.47]Phylactery's bought me dinner like 6,000 times.
[28:26.69]So, I mean... Alright, hold on.
[28:30.01]There's an indicator right here.
[28:37.51]Request transport.
[28:39.49]Not ready for transport.
[28:42.85]No pulse.
[28:43.81]CPR again?
[28:51.98]Do the defib again.
[28:52.90]OK.
[28:53.28]All right, stop doing that.
[28:56.86]Get up.
[29:05.54]What is additional?
[29:06.66]Traffic cones?
[29:09.53]What?
[29:09.73]Wait, why do I have this?
[29:12.97]I'm just, like, playing.
[29:32.11]What a dick.
[29:34.09]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[29:36.73]Defib, let's go.
[29:42.13]Defib.
[29:42.73]Okay.
[29:43.97]Put him back on.
[29:46.85]You've got a pulse.
[29:47.65]Why does it say no pulse?
[29:48.97]Grab the stretcher.
[29:49.71]I already did this.
[29:51.27]Load the patient and deliver to the hospital.
[29:54.41]Okay, okay, okay.
[29:55.17]How do I load the patient?
[30:04.39]Oh.
[30:05.55]Cannot do this while... Oh, I have to undo the connections.
[30:10.69]Alright, undo these connections.
[30:14.62]Alright, put this down.
[30:16.78]So you do have to kind of go over them.
[30:19.00]Okay, pick up.
[30:22.38]Got him.
[30:23.30]Alright, let's go.
[30:33.29]Into the car.
[30:34.73]Let's go.
[30:35.21]Into the car.
[30:38.13]Okay, let's go.
[30:39.49]Let's go.
[30:51.00]He's going... Oh no!
[30:53.14]Oh no!
[30:54.04]Oh no!
[30:54.81]Oh no!
[30:55.59]Not into the river!
[31:01.95]Not into the river.
[31:06.95]Okay, get in.
[31:09.51]Alright, door is closed.
[31:10.95]Let's get you to the hospital.
[31:12.75]Where's the hospital?
[31:20.24]Yeah, I know, I know.
[31:21.32]Yes, I'm aware that we just did, like, a 90s comedy routine.
[31:24.82]Yes.
[31:28.29]I think that happens in every single Leslie Nielsen movie.
[31:33.01]And, I mean, those movies are legendary, but that does happen.
[31:36.01]Alright, let's go back.
[31:44.53]Get your bag.
[31:45.18]I don't need my bag.
[31:46.70]I'll get a new bag.
[31:48.44]Can I skip this?
[31:50.66]Hold on!
[31:51.14]Alright, that guy just hit the ceiling of the ambulance.
[31:58.05]He went like, BOOM!
[32:01.27]I'm not going down that stupid thing again.
[32:09.23]I'm stuck.
[32:12.15]I'm so glad there's no time limit because this would be so stupid.
[32:16.42]I'm not driving down that bullshit again.
[32:25.19]There's no cars on the road.
[32:26.21]Why would I even need to have the siren?
[32:28.21]Hopefully this guy's bolted to the ground.
[32:53.37]Alright, where do I go?
[32:54.49]Just drop off at the front?
[33:05.86]Okay, get him out.
[33:15.28]Let's go.
[33:21.30]In.
[33:22.66]Alright, where?
[33:23.76]Into the... Here?
[33:26.42]I did it.
[33:30.44]Patient delivered.
[33:34.84]Alright, that was pretty fun.
[33:45.11]Okay.
[33:46.29]See, and I got a new medical bag too.
[33:48.75]You guys were so concerned about that.
[33:59.95]Did I miss any of the calls?
[34:00.99]Alright, I have two patients hospital.
[34:04.98]Oh, here we go.
[34:05.80]Another vehicle incident.
[34:07.50]Uh, let's skip this one.
[34:09.62]Alright, I'm gonna fill- I'm gonna get gas.
[34:18.89]You're wasting tax dollars.
[34:20.99]I mean, am I though?
[34:23.62]There's like seven ambulances.
[34:30.08]This is not how you pull into a gas station.
[34:31.76]What the fuck am I doing?
[34:36.04]Where's the, um... It's right there.
[34:39.42]Okay.
[34:41.40]Skip.
[34:44.55]I don't drive big cars, guys.
[34:47.89]I'm so used to being on the... It's on my car, it's on the right side, okay?
[34:51.27]So that's why... And it's like that every time.
[34:54.30]And yes, I know everyone, oh, you have to look every time.
[34:58.03]You have to look at your gas meter on your dashboard every time.
[35:01.23]Yeah, you do too.
[35:02.87]Even if you've owned the car for 10 years, okay?
[35:06.09]I gotta turn the engine off, what?
[35:15.46]Vehicle incident, nah.
[35:16.24]All right, fuel.
[35:18.94]How do I fuel?
[35:20.25]Is it fueling?
[35:24.26]Is it fueling?
[35:25.04]Do I have to pay?
[35:27.48]Do I have to pay money?
[35:50.92]Vehicle incident, nah.
[35:58.69]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[36:00.29]I don't know.
[36:05.25]I'm not sure.
[36:05.57]Okay, you just click it and it fills instantly.
[36:10.84]I just need to see, I'm just curious, can I make my own incident to then bring this person to the hospital?
[36:30.33]Don't worry, I got you.
[36:31.46]I'll take care of you.
[36:33.38]What happened?
[36:38.62]What?
[37:00.71]Where are you going?
[37:01.32]You're going the wrong way.
[37:02.34]Where are you going?
[37:04.30]Hold on.
[37:06.88]You're going the wrong way this way.
[37:15.45]Did you fall?
[37:17.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[37:18.17]Hold on.
[37:21.65]They can't get over here.
[37:23.33]I have to cause a couple more injuries.
[37:25.31]This is where we test it out.
[37:26.22]This is where we test the theory.
[37:43.96]Steal the other ambulance.
[37:44.98]Hold on, I will.
[37:47.32]Or I'll try.
[37:47.84]Alright, ambulance on route.
[38:07.16]Ambulance on route.
[38:09.12]Okay.
[38:09.28]Okay.
[38:18.40]Move!
[38:18.96]Move!
[38:21.92]Get out of the way!
[38:28.80]How many ambulances can I have at the same time?
[38:31.42]Oh god, here we go!
[38:34.74]Come here!
[38:35.43]I got you!
[38:48.72]Damn it!
[38:57.50]That's the plan.
[38:58.58]Okay, we got a new plan here.
[39:03.52]Yeah.
[39:04.04]When the EMT gets out, run over the EMT.
[39:06.94]And then call an ambulance for the EMT.
[39:12.54]Fuck, they're immune!
[39:13.80]Damn it, they're immune to damage!
[39:17.92]No!
[39:18.04]They're immune to damage.
[39:19.46]It's not fair.
[39:21.22]Not fair.
[39:21.96]That guy's pissed.
[39:32.93]You keep yourself in business, but they can't go anywhere.
[39:56.33]Alright, vehicle incident.
[40:00.03]Where's the vehicle incident?
[40:00.89]It's all the way back there?
[40:04.49]Turn your blinker off.
[40:05.63]Oh shit, you're right, I'm sorry.
[40:09.75]Another vehicle incident.
[40:14.05]Hit a... Yeah, alright, alright, alright.
[40:15.73]We gotta get to a spawn area.
[40:18.09]Because what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run over like ten people.
[40:21.51]And then I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna go bang, bang, bang, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[40:25.19]Call ambulance, ambulance, ambulance, ambulance, and roll.
[40:31.31]Why is my blinker still on?
[40:32.95]Turn it off.
[40:37.05]It's... Guys, my blinker's off.
[40:40.65]Do you...
[40:44.01]I can't turn... It's on.
[40:48.50]Now the other one's on.
[40:49.18]They're going to go all the way up here again.
[41:01.01]Turn off blinker.
[41:07.56]Oh my god.
[41:08.22]It is driving me crazy now that you mention it.
[41:12.21]I can't fucking believe I have to go up here again.
[41:13.55]No, skip this one.
[41:14.47]Skip it.
[41:14.75]I don't even want to do this one.
[41:16.31]Is it too late?
[41:24.74]Your blinker fluid is too low.
[41:27.78]How do I... D?
[41:33.80]How do I, like, turn... I'm going to get out of the car.
[41:38.40]Turn the engine off.
[41:39.22]Turn the engine off.
[41:39.92]Ready?
[41:40.06]Ready?
[41:59.41]I can't turn it off.
[42:05.92]Just unplug the battery.
[42:07.90]Yeah, I know.
[42:08.28]Don't worry.
[42:08.52]That's the plan.
[42:08.99]The plan is we're going to... We're going to hit at least 10 people.
[42:13.61]And I'm going to run around and call an ambulance for every single one of them and watch the chaos.
[42:17.71]Press 3.
[42:19.07]Yeah, I mean, that... Look!
[42:20.72]Look at the bottom of the screen!
[42:34.59]Press the left arrow key.
[42:35.51]That's turn.
[42:35.99]Okay.
[42:46.83]Saved a little bit of time there.
[42:57.53]That noise is going to drive me fucking crazy.
[42:59.83]It's going to drive me crazy.
[43:01.65]It really is.
[43:02.35]You're right.
[43:02.91]It's driving me crazy right now.
[43:04.35]Alright, I'm here.
[43:06.74]What happened?
[43:10.68]What an entrance.
[43:13.28]Oh, look.
[43:13.68]Someone's just lying on the ground.
[43:28.11]Okay.
[43:28.99]I need the damn med bag.
[43:32.73]Just get it all out of here.
[43:35.45]Alright, what's wrong?
[43:38.71]Inspect.
[43:39.83]Head.
[43:42.11]No pulse.
[43:42.84]Okay, there's no pulse.
[43:44.18]Let's get the defib.
[43:47.50]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[43:48.52]What are you doing?
[43:51.58]Oh, right click.
[43:53.14]Okay.
[43:56.08]Okay.
[44:04.16]Hook it up?
[44:05.86]Okay.
[44:06.96]Uh, I have to... Wait, what?
[44:10.62]Oh, um, hold on.
[44:17.39]Wait, hold on.
[44:20.43]Okay, no, this is his bathing suit, okay?
[44:22.19]This is his bathing suit.
[44:23.85]Alright, um... Let's, uh, where's the defib?
[44:27.55]Where's the defib?
[44:28.23]Where's the defib?
[44:28.77]Defib, defib, defib, defib.
[44:39.14]I just did.
[44:39.60]Let me inspect.
[44:42.05]Didn't I just do that?
[44:44.17]I gotta go.
[44:44.69]Hurry up.
[44:47.69]Where's my med bag?
[44:48.55]I just teleported it.
[44:49.77]Alright.
[44:51.31]Inspect.
[44:51.81]I have to inspect every single point here?
[44:57.83]I know the possible bone fracture.
[44:59.94]Oh, shit.
[45:01.74]Okay.
[45:02.58]Perform CPR.
[45:04.80]Okay, here we go.
[45:14.06]How do I fix the bone fracture?
[45:15.24]What do I do?
[45:23.66]Okay, use defib.
[45:24.56]Alright, let's go, let's go.
[45:34.95]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[45:36.79]Alright, one, two, three.
[45:40.37]Um...
[45:42.32]That just looks like a wavelength in audacity.
[45:47.40]Shock pads.
[45:51.49]Okay, here we go.
[45:52.11]Did it work?
[46:05.54]I need a fracture kit?
[46:07.64]Where's a fracture kit?
[46:08.86]Alright, fracture kit.
[46:11.36]Uh... Technical.
[46:13.92]Items.
[46:14.65]Fracture kit.
[46:18.93]Okay, here we go.
[46:19.55]That's it.
[46:22.23]Alright, grab the stretcher and deliver it.
[46:24.36]Okay, let's go.
[46:25.42]Wait, I have to take all this stuff off.
[46:34.88]Alright, get... I need to get this off.
[46:39.19]Give me this.
[46:40.95]Okay, remove.
[46:44.65]Ah, I fixed it.
[46:45.21]I'm good.
[46:55.76]Ow!
[46:58.87]No one's in the road.
[47:00.31]Oh, I got a fracture.
[47:01.85]I got a left leg fracture too.
[47:04.29]We're the same now, you and me.
[47:05.81]Alright.
[47:14.26]Here we go.
[47:14.70]Okay.
[47:22.14]No, I can't.
[47:24.18]I can't.
[47:26.26]I can't just into the water.
[47:28.36]Oh, no.
[47:30.17]Please.
[47:30.63]No.
[47:31.53]No.
[47:35.47]Don't worry, I'll get you.
[48:06.46]I think she's okay.
[48:08.48]Wait, can I?
[48:09.48]I can't just go into the ocean, right?
[48:12.04]Why can't I go?
[48:13.31]Wait, oh shit!
[48:14.97]Wait, wait, contact with water?
[48:16.41]What do you mean contact with water?
[48:18.69]Is that a tube?
[48:26.51]I think I got fired.
[48:39.89]I think the game doesn't know what to do with me.
[48:45.61]It's a new person.
[48:47.53]Wait, is she still there?
[48:58.10]Vehicle incident, sure.
[49:00.84]Is she still there?
[49:08.10]Alright, do you think that she is still there, yes or no?
[49:10.70]What do you think?
[49:16.62]And can I get her?
[49:17.86]No.
[49:19.27]No, it's definitely been reset.
[49:23.09]Okay, whatever.
[49:23.87]Uh...
[49:32.10]Hey, this is not even... We have two more departments to go through.
[49:46.97]Wait, what?
[49:48.42]Open... What do you want me to do?
[49:58.19]Why do I always get stuck like this in every game?
[50:03.85]What?
[50:04.01]What do I do?
[50:04.73]Slash... Car 100.
[50:05.81]Is that bullshit?
[50:33.42]I have car 100 to create tonic traffic.
[50:37.02]That didn't do anything.
[50:39.46]Slash car 100.
[50:40.08]It's not doing anything.
[50:47.16]Is it car space 100?
[50:49.27]No, it's not.
[51:03.79]You have to get out and do it.
[51:19.46]Alright, well, good.
[51:20.34]Nice.
[51:20.82]Good one.
[51:21.91]Got me.

[52:53.50]The ocean.
[52:54.12]I'm not putting him in the ocean.
[52:59.87]I don't think you can actually go in this way.
[53:01.11]Alright, you're in.
[53:02.21]Close.
[53:03.83]I don't think you can fall out that way, so who cares?
[53:06.01]I really don't think you can.
[53:09.17]Speaking of which, I'm not sure I can get back in the car.
[53:12.23]Oh, maybe I can.
[53:16.41]He definitely cannot fall out that way.
[53:30.08]Alright, I think we may have seen all there is to see with the EMT.
[53:35.09]I think it's time to switch to Firefighter.
[53:36.21]Yep.
[53:36.31]It's Firefighter time.
[53:37.87]Yeah, I'm gonna try my bullshit one time.
[54:13.30]I've done so much weird shit, and how do I only have a... That's not that big of a deal.

[54:37.80]Let's go.
[54:40.48]Haha.
[54:41.66]Good.
[54:44.36]All right, if we have one more opportunity here, I'm going to skip a couple, and I want to get like a person fell off a tree or something, a person fell down a hole.
[54:56.50]Is there any of those?
[54:57.06]You can choose the next mission with a command.
[55:12.86]Oh, I left a stretcher.
[55:14.26]I don't get a new one?
[55:15.40]On a new mission?
[55:15.90]I thought that happened last time.
[55:19.27]What did I do?
[55:19.73]I just pressed N. I just skipped something.
[55:33.61]Cheat codes?
[55:37.86]Wait, hold on.
[55:38.30]What is this?
[55:39.88]Change role.

[57:34.52]What is this cartoon thing?
[57:36.26]They don't have that.
[57:40.40]That would be so bad for people coming the other direction, wouldn't it?
[57:43.05]Like, just... That would be ridiculous.
[57:45.39]On top, I understand, but, like, that's crazy.
[57:47.15]Alright, let's go.
[58:05.01]This iron doesn't do anything.
[58:09.13]This iron doesn't do anything.
[58:12.26]Alright, here we go.
[58:13.56]Uh, the diner.

[59:58.50]What happened?
[60:06.28]Is an ambulance coming?
[60:13.30]How are they gonna get in here?
[60:18.04]Play as the EMT and save yourself.
[60:31.67]Is he gonna come to the front door?
[60:32.93]Oh shit.
[60:43.02]Wait, what?
[60:44.90]You brought me back to what?
[60:47.97]I did it!

[61:17.40]What about this person?
[61:18.37]Is this person right here okay?
[61:33.87]I have to run out.
[61:34.65]It's the second... the second that he gets in here.
[61:42.72]Here he comes.

[63:29.80]Not much.
[63:36.02]Okay, well, there's a fire.
[63:37.28]It's not just smoke, there's a fire up here.
[63:39.64]Can the EMT get on the roof?
[63:41.52]Is a question that we'll have to ask.
[63:56.78]I soft-locked it?
[63:57.82]Alright, I'll... Is there a better camera?
[64:09.31]Alright, come on, get up here.

[81:50.29]It's just time to get this done.
[81:57.08]Wherever this fire is.
[81:59.46]Where is it?
[82:01.86]There it is.
[82:18.12]Okay.
[82:19.04]There's more?
[82:24.17]Is there more?
[82:24.99]Oh, easy.
[82:26.31]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[82:31.04]I'm just spraying this straight now.
[82:33.26]Where's this other fire?
[82:38.04]Pull it back.
[82:38.52]It's going to go up.
[82:39.38]That's the problem.
[82:39.96]It has to go up.
[82:55.84]Okay, seriously.
[82:57.36]Stop driving.
[82:58.22]Somebody's in control of the actual car.
[83:01.28]Pull it back.
[83:01.88]There's a fire right there.
[83:04.92]I see it.
[83:05.34]I almost got it.
[83:09.29]Right here.
[83:10.53]There it is.
[83:20.61]There's four more fires here.
[83:24.33]Where the fuck are these other fires?
[83:28.32]Seriously, where are they?
[83:29.86]Are they still on the roof?
[83:32.80]Right here?
[83:33.14]There's one right here, I think.
[83:37.64]The car is just driving without me.
[83:53.24]The same car.
[83:55.58]There's too many white vans in this universe.
[83:59.02]All right, here we go.
[84:07.20]Am I hitting it?
[84:22.79]No?
[84:24.87]There it is.

[86:09.39]Example command.
[86:11.48]Ped 5.
[86:12.26]I don't think these work.
[86:24.76]Maybe the console commands have to be turned on?
[86:26.50]I'm not sure there's a thing in the menu for that.
[86:27.94]Alright, let me just do this.

[95:34.76]Why would you have punching?
[95:36.48]Alright, no overpass.
[95:40.55]I gotta go this way.

[95:49.09]I'm full of it.
[95:57.35]Alright, let's go.

[96:16.44]God damn it!
[96:17.32]What the fuck?
[96:21.66]I thought they were... Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[96:24.00]This is where I was.
[96:26.59]It was, the perspective was like this.
[96:28.83]Like, I was like right here.
[96:32.58]Look, I thought they were both in the same part of the road.
[96:34.58]Look, see how they connected?
[96:39.26]So I'm like, oh shit, I have to go around this.
[96:42.98]You're as blind as bad.
[96:43.80]No, that's real.
[96:45.04]Because I actually do, if I have sound available, I can hear better.
[96:51.14]I would get, fucking idiot.
[96:52.92]I can see better if I can hear what's happening.
[96:59.91]I think, okay, I might be fucked here.

[97:11.90]I think I'm fucked.
[97:16.41]Yep.
[97:17.15]Alright, we're gonna do something drastic.
[97:21.37]Hold on.

[98:53.67]I don't want to put this out again.
[98:56.09]This is the same one.
[98:57.35]I don't want to do this one again.

[101:24.12]Alright, is there any other jobs to do besides just spray the same building over and over again?
[101:50.00]You just force spawn them with cheats.
[101:52.20]Well, cheats don't really work.
[101:53.48]I haven't been able to get them to work.
[102:02.69]These fires are in like some strange places.
[102:06.87]Yeah, what are some of the other cheats that's not that?
[102:15.93]Where is this fire?

[102:31.43]I know it's right here, but what the hell is going on?
[103:00.09]Alright, let me look at the cheats.
[103:01.01]I want to spawn a different mission.
[103:05.61]Okay, so a command to force the next mission is set.
[103:08.79]It does not force the call.
[103:10.36]It will appear still at random.
[103:12.30]It cannot be the same twice in a row.
[103:14.80]What?

[111:32.25]Cat stuck in a tree.
[111:34.05]Okay.
[111:35.14]Is it her?
[111:35.52]This time just run the tree over with your truck.
[111:51.89]Oh, that's so loud.
[111:53.11]Stop.
[111:53.61]Get away from me.
[112:07.09]Putting on a siren for a cat.
[112:08.56]Yeah, this is an emergency.
[112:09.62]What if the cat, like, fell?
[112:11.71]Or what if somebody cut the tree down with a chainsaw?
[112:13.77]I've got to be prepared.
[112:15.48]I've got to be ready.
[112:36.26]I think I can do it.
[112:38.74]No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.
[112:40.45]I think I can do it.
[112:41.13]I really think it's possible.
[112:42.09]I do.
[112:50.29]Alright, so it's not possible.
[112:51.39]Fuck it.
[112:51.69]Whatever.
[112:51.95]You were right.
[112:52.31]I was wrong.
[112:53.21]I was wrong.
[112:53.63]You were right.
[112:54.17]I was wrong.
[112:54.61]You were right.
[112:55.43]And I will admit that.
[112:56.09]That's fine.
[112:57.15]I thought that it was possible that I could go up and over.
[113:00.87]I might be able to, but... Okay.
[113:02.54]Fine.
[113:04.88]No, you're right.
[113:05.24]You're right.
[113:05.58]You're right.
[113:05.94]You're right.
[113:11.44]It's good to try.
[113:12.56]You gotta try at least once.
[113:19.40]I hate going up here.
[113:25.45]Oh, that's right.
[113:26.73]There is still police missions to do.
[113:33.41]What is that?
[113:52.23]Why do you have the Hollywood Hills place from GTA 5 here?
[113:57.77]And there's always missions over here.
[114:13.67]Alright, there's the tree.
[114:15.39]Let's go.
[114:16.69]Enough bullshit.
[114:18.55]I'm climbing up there, and I'm gonna get the cat myself.

[114:31.63]You're gonna get stuck.
[114:41.70]Okay.
[114:41.82]Okay.
[114:43.94]I'm here.
[114:48.44]Cat stuck in a tree.
[114:53.66]Alright, which seems to be the problem.
[114:59.79]Found the cat.

[116:05.99]Save, uh, I saved the cat.
[116:08.21]Who cares?
[116:15.20]That's two failed cats.
[116:16.34]That's two rescued cats, actually.
[116:38.22]There's another cat?
[116:40.18]Why is there another cat in the tree?
[116:42.56]You have two cats.
[116:49.66]Okay, well, you have two cats.
[116:56.57]Told you I was doing business with you.
[116:57.57]Alright, let's go.
[116:59.61]You didn't have clearance to do that?
[117:03.31]Um...
[117:04.86]It was violating... She was violating her neighbor's yard.
[117:12.29]Vehicle fire.
[117:12.95]No.
[117:13.19]Alright.
[117:14.67]Any other good ones for fire?
[117:17.51]Driver trapped?
[117:18.95]Alright, how about driver trapped?
[117:21.00]We'll try this one.
[117:26.56]Um, I don't know.
[117:27.88]18?
[117:30.66]Oh, here comes the cliff joke!
[117:39.59]All right.
[117:41.47]Okay.
[117:41.61]I want to see drive a trap.
[117:42.49]And then we'll do police.
[117:43.33]I promise.
[117:47.14]Vehicle incident.
[117:48.04]No.
[117:49.04]That's not it.
[117:54.04]18.
[117:56.59]I'm going to stay up here for a second because just in case it's up here.
[118:00.21]I'm not doing this again.
[118:08.83]Wait, that was it?
[118:10.38]I thought that was a... Oh.
[118:14.28]That was it.
[118:14.70]You monster.
[118:15.36]Alright, alright.
[118:16.66]I thought it was vehicle... I thought it was, like, vehicle incident, not, like, driver... I don't know.
[118:20.66]We've seen, like, a bunch of vehicle incidents in the same thing.
[118:24.79]Building fire.
[118:25.63]Nope.
[118:28.07]Okay, let's do it.
[118:28.83]And then it was 18...
[118:47.35]Come on.
[118:49.85]Drive that guy off the road.
[118:51.17]I'm not going to do that.
[118:53.81]Come on.
[118:57.09]Let's go.
[118:57.49]Alright, driver trapped.
[119:00.94]Yes.
[119:02.82]Where is it?
[119:04.70]I knew I should have stayed here, right?
[119:06.44]See, I told you.
[119:09.14]Wait, where is that?
[119:11.50]No, that's really far away.
[119:13.02]Is there a beach in this game?
[119:15.22]Why is everything in this... This is a huge map.
[119:17.22]Jesus.
[119:19.90]This is actually a giant map.
[119:31.29]Like, that was not meant to be a joke.
[119:33.52]Like, that was just quicker to get down here.
[119:36.50]That's not... Oh, look at me.
[119:38.06]I'm jumping off a cliff.
[119:41.16]No, that's... I'm just trying to get here fast.
[119:58.03]Minus one.
[119:58.85]Yeah, I know.
[119:59.49]That's fine.
[119:59.99]You can do that.
[120:04.50]Explaining the joke doesn't make it funny.
[120:14.41]It would have taken me so much time.
[120:25.38]Wrong way.
[120:26.02]I know.
[120:26.76]This is how I drive in games.
[120:28.52]I'm telling you.
[120:29.18]I'm sorry.
[120:30.58]It happens every single time I play any game.
[120:33.95]I drive on the other side of the road.
[120:35.71]It's something about it.
[120:36.95]It's easier for my brain to understand.
[120:39.51]In a video game.
[120:40.33]Like I drive my car every fucking day.
[120:42.23]Let's be realistic here.
[120:47.85]I don't know why.
[120:49.01]And I missed the turn.
[120:50.34]Because I'm sitting here just... Yapping.
[120:53.00]Yapping.
[120:55.68]They can't even go over the medium.
[120:56.63]I have to turn around.
[120:57.95]I have to turn around.
[121:01.91]God damn it.
[121:04.83]I gotta spin this car around.
[121:09.46]Admit it.
[121:09.86]You have a butler drive you places.
[121:15.60]I don't have a butler.
[121:25.89]Get the fuck over here.
[121:27.23]I gotta go... Who put these cones here?
[121:32.08]There's not even any construction.
[121:33.74]Fuck!
[121:34.82]No!
[121:35.12]Why does this have to keep happening to me?
[121:37.98]I can't even... Why does this have to happen to me?
[121:40.12]This keeps happening to me.
[121:42.36]When things like this keep happening to you, you're the problem.
[121:45.04]You know what I mean?
[121:45.60]Like, I'm the problem here.
[121:48.26]This... Oh, wait.
[121:49.45]Why did I get stuck here?
[121:51.19]When it happens every time, the problem, I think, is probably you.
[121:54.27]You know, it's me.
[122:00.41]Alright, fuck off with this!
[122:13.93]He's driving on the wrong side of the road, and he finally, he says, maybe I'm the problem.
[122:19.94]Not right there!
[122:20.60]I was driving normally there.
[122:30.04]Is this a SimCity highway?
[122:33.63]These counter-odges are all over the place, aren't they?
[122:35.27]Alright, vehicle incident.
[122:37.03]Here we are.

[125:04.88]Can't use this.
[125:17.38]How do I do CPR?
[125:22.98]What's this guy doing?

[161:45.90]Alright, let's go.
[161:49.84]I was gonna say, why would I say it like that?
[161:53.74]That's odd.
[161:54.02]Alright, I'm gonna follow this person.
[162:09.80]Turn off the sirens.
[162:18.36]I'm not even in the area anymore.
[162:21.84]Am I even gonna be able to find this person?
[162:23.32]I don't think I'm gonna be able to find this person.
[162:39.30]I'm gonna have to skip this one.
[162:47.51]No.

[163:23.66]Yeah, you can play this game online.
[163:25.13]Yeah, I know.
[163:27.61]I wasn't sure how stable it was.
[163:34.79]What about that person?
[163:38.46]Respond code 1 with your police radio?
[163:41.64]Wait.
[163:43.72]How do I do that?
[163:45.47]How do I open up that thing that I had?
[163:51.06]No, not that.
[163:51.90]What was that?
[163:52.66]How did I get that menu?

[174:21.41]The person has a dozen bullet holes in their car, and they come back to a parking ticket.
[174:27.17]Oh, that's so fucked up.
[174:31.45]All right, this guy's mine.
[174:45.63]Where'd you go?

[176:17.02]Okay.
[176:17.70]Never mind.
[176:20.44]Uh, sorry, someone will get you.

[176:37.48]Oh, shit!
[176:37.98]No, no, no, no, no, no.

[176:45.17]Bald guy.
[176:47.32]That's how you know he's a criminal.
[176:50.53]They can't get over here.
[177:23.54]I think the game's broken.
[177:26.18]Ah, here we go, here we go.
[177:29.28]You know what, whatever.
[177:31.70]Just... There we go, here you go.

[177:56.34]Nobody gets, like, scared?
[177:57.40]Okay.
[177:57.50]Alright, that's it.
[177:59.94]I'm gonna move on.
[178:03.24]That's it.
[178:06.32]Interact?
[178:08.51]With who?
[178:10.49]Wait, what?
[178:12.07]Oh, he's running over the body over and over again.
[178:14.87]He's stuck on the guy's body.
[178:16.45]This is fucked up.
[178:23.11]Hey!
[178:23.81]Alright.
[178:24.29]Alright.
[178:24.73]Okay.
[178:25.33]Alright.
[178:25.67]That's enough.
[178:26.31]Stop.
[178:27.31]Stop.
[178:28.43]Stop this right now.
[178:30.13]Stop.

[178:42.20]Out of the car.
[178:43.00]Get out of the car.
[178:44.98]Get out of the car.
[178:49.08]Get out of the car.
[178:59.88]I don't think this even does anything.
[179:02.49]No, this doesn't do anything.
[179:06.09]This doesn't do anything!
[179:13.05]The glass doesn't break.
[179:16.81]Watch out.
[179:17.19]Alright, I think I've seen everything I can see in this game.
[179:22.65]This is pretty- pretty interesting.
[179:30.33]It has to be from the other side.
[179:31.59]No, it does not.
[179:37.92]No, see, it's not doing anything.
[179:44.72]Alright, let me go to the bathroom.
[179:45.82]I'll figure out what we're going to do.
[179:56.36]Some nice cars.
[179:58.26]Wait, what?
[179:59.50]Oh.
[180:22.94]All right.

[180:25.87]I'm out.
[180:26.47]I'm out.
[180:27.27]I'll be back in a minute.
[180:28.45]I'm going to go pee and we'll come back and do something else.
[180:39.04]Hold on.
[180:40.90]I'm trying to exit the game.
[180:43.06]Okay.
[180:43.18]I'll be right back.
