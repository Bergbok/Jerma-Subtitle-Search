[ve:60.16.100]

[01:11.14]Hey, everybody.
[01:13.10]How are you?
[01:15.66]Late streamer.
[01:16.18]Yes, we are very late.
[01:17.50]We are.
[01:20.70]Exceptionally late tonight.
[01:24.24]By about an hour and a half.
[01:25.50]But it's okay.
[01:26.40]Don't worry.
[01:26.92]We're going to be fine.
[01:28.97]We've got a brand new Spider-Man game to play.
[01:33.29]And it's Absolver.
[01:40.91]Always late.
[01:42.61]You're in the middle of the checkup.
[01:44.31]Yeah, it's a checkup.
[01:46.29]We just had to check on ourselves.
[01:47.89]We had to go to the doctor.
[01:48.83]You guys are the doctor.
[01:49.69]You guys are the teacher.
[01:50.37]You guys are teacher, doctor, and parent.
[01:57.04]You have a quiz tomorrow?
[01:58.04]Well, hopefully you do alright.
[01:59.34]Hopefully you got a quiz.
[02:00.32]Hopefully you studied for that quiz and you got an A tomorrow.
[02:06.92]No Monday stream equals Jerma is a tub shitter.
[02:10.94]I know.
[02:11.22]I'm so bad.
[02:11.86]Like, I don't know how many times, how many days are going to go by where I'm like, Monday, we're going to do an off schedule.
[02:18.35]Just kidding.
[02:18.89]It just doesn't happen.
[02:20.35]Like, I got to stop doing that shit.
[02:23.87]Anyways, let me get set up.
[02:26.74]This game's like online, but it's like the servers are freaking out for me.
[02:29.98]So give me just a minute.
[02:30.66]I'll be right there.
[02:31.80]Starting soon.
[03:33.40]Hey, alright, so I can't connect.
[03:36.62]I just was on the server and now I can't get on the Absolver server.
[03:41.44]Fairly disappointing.
[03:42.96]I wonder why that is.
[03:43.68]Uh... Server connection failed.
[03:51.94]Why, uh... Why is that happening?
[03:58.15]Guess I have to play the... You can start the game in offline mode.
[04:01.11]I'm just hoping eventually it'll, uh...
[04:04.50]Server connection failed.
[04:06.70]Okay.
[04:09.35]Well, I was just on it.
[04:12.83]So, like, obviously it happens.
[04:14.53]Alright, let's go to options.
[04:16.71]Let's go to offline mode.
[04:19.05]Because I got, okay, online mode.
[04:21.24]Let's see if we can, like, kick it back into, like, existing.
[04:26.62]They've been down.
[04:27.48]Absolva server is down.
[04:29.92]What the fuck?
[04:31.14]Well, I want to play.
[04:32.22]This game just came out today.
[04:33.31]I need to play this game.
[04:35.25]We're going to start an offline mode.
[04:38.91]We're going to start an offline mode and we're just going to learn the game and we're going to try again.
[04:44.55]No.
[04:44.81]No retrying.
[04:45.77]We're literally just... Oh my fucking lord.
[04:48.11]Can a game just work when it comes out?
[04:54.80]Oh god.
[04:56.42]We're off to a great start.
[04:57.64]Hey, did you want to like start streaming and like... No, the servers turn off.
[05:03.63]This is all the fucking Diablo 3 always online.
[05:05.97]This is what happens.
[05:07.41]No retrying.
[05:08.19]Let's just do the fucking tutorial.
[05:11.71]Give me a fucking break.
[05:14.07]Okay, new game.
[05:17.15]Buying a game and simply playing it in 2017.
[05:19.79]I know, right?
[05:20.37]Anyways, LambLamb.
[05:22.45]LambLamb just immediately restarted the stream with a $50 bit donation.
[05:26.07]It says, we love you.
[05:27.43]Well, thank you, LambLamb.
[05:29.17]That's incredibly fucking generous of you.
[05:32.03]Uh...
[05:33.37]Some of you guys give a lot of money.
[05:35.65]And all I ever have to say is thanks.
[05:39.83]Yeah, that's a lot of fucking money.
[05:41.79]You are very, very generous.
[05:43.27]Thank you.
[05:44.69]Alright, so we got... Origin... I don't even know what any of this means.
[05:48.55]We're gonna go with, like, Iceman.
[05:54.13]Sex, male...
[05:58.02]It would have been 30 if you weren't late.
[06:01.07]But thank you, Lambland.
[06:01.97]Thank you, Tub Tucker as well.
[06:04.59]Huffle.
[06:06.05]Huffle Pages.
[06:06.99]Thank you for the five bucks.
[06:07.81]Cool new video, Jerma.
[06:08.63]We'll always love you.
[06:09.33]I appreciate that.
[06:12.23]Sam, shaking my head.
[06:13.09]Thanks for the bits.
[06:13.83]I love the late streamer.
[06:14.83]I know I'm starting late.
[06:16.09]The King of the North.
[06:16.67]Thanks for the bits.
[06:17.51]Also, Quaz.
[06:19.63]Thank you for the bits.
[06:21.23]$3.70.
[06:21.49]I enjoy Spider-Man games also.
[06:24.60]They're very, very fun games.
[06:27.38]So, a haircut, we're gonna go with... This?
[06:30.92]No.
[06:32.24]This.
[06:33.70]And it has to be... It's gotta be, like, fucking... Blonde, right?
[06:38.25]Light blonde.
[06:39.83]Smooth, slick.
[06:41.37]Next.
[06:42.89]Okay, this is important.
[06:44.14]I have to make sure I get this right.
[06:46.24]Choose bald?
[06:46.86]No, I'm not bald.
[06:48.90]Thank you, Gary.
[06:49.44]Great for the $2.
[06:49.78]And we can talk about the video for a second.
[06:51.94]Like, I mean, maybe for just a minute.
[06:53.56]Oh, you know, speaking of videos, you want to hear something funny about videos?
[06:56.58]So like I check on the main channel every now and then, and 150 of the videos on my main channel have been like deemed not advertiser friendly.
[07:08.75]Oddly enough, the last video that I made of me talking about the channel,
[07:15.36]There's no, like, bad words in that video.
[07:17.40]There's no, like, violence.
[07:18.86]There's nothing bad in that.
[07:20.40]It's me talking to you guys about my channel.
[07:22.82]That's apparently not advertiser-friendly.
[07:25.98]Holy shit, YouTube sucks.
[07:28.60]Like, YouTube sucks, asshole.
[07:31.21]Like, it really does.
[07:32.19]Like, what?
[07:34.85]Like, 150 of my videos are just gone.
[07:36.03]Doesn't make any sense.
[07:42.52]But anyways, let's, uh... Balance combat style with a slight focus on strength.
[07:47.93]Ability is active.
[07:49.01]My active parry blocks completely the attack and stun your opponent.
[07:52.61]Okay.
[07:54.93]Improves mainly strength and vitality.
[07:56.45]This is the cult method.
[07:58.65]Dismisses the stun of the attack the lost health can be recovered so I can like absorb.
[08:02.53]This is more like defensive.
[08:03.61]I'm assuming Windfall improves mainly dex dex build.
[08:08.29]I don't know people are gonna make fun of me with this one Avoids and slows down the attack so I could I have like an avoid ability.
[08:14.14]I like kind of like that kind of might be a blood-borne I Don't know should I do like dex or should I do strong guy I think I'm gonna do dex I'm gonna do dex build
[08:28.76]Ability, avoid.
[08:29.82]Yes, this is the one.
[08:30.80]We're doing fucking wildfall.
[08:33.40]No, no, no.
[08:34.52]Dex, not dex.
[08:36.52]Should I not do dexterity?
[08:41.12]I love how someone just wrote, Absolver kind of sucks.
[08:45.73]Three star difficulty?
[08:46.95]Well, they're all three star difficulty.
[08:49.15]There's no difference.
[08:51.13]Alright, we're doing dex build.
[08:54.03]Name, Absolver.
[08:55.75]No, my name's gonna be
[09:01.84]Can I not?
[09:07.47]I can't change the name?
[09:08.49]Hold on.
[09:13.51]Okay.
[09:14.51]What the fuck was that?
[09:20.06]Let's do it.
[09:23.70]Here we go.
[09:24.26]Opening cutscene.
[09:25.52]Absolver.
[09:28.86]In the Darkest Dungeon.
[09:36.32]I love it, look at it, I'm right in the middle.
[09:38.26]That means I have the balance of the force.
[09:42.35]I'm right in the middle, guys.
[09:43.49]I have the force.
[09:45.75]Dark side and the light.
[09:55.92]Oh, we're playing Duck Duck Goose?
[09:59.41]We're playing Silent Duck Duck Goose.
[10:02.31]And you have to walk after you get tapped.
[10:06.57]This isn't going to take a while.
[10:11.61]This was your mother.
[10:13.17]It's a hologram.
[10:14.07]It's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[10:15.17]More Star Wars jokes.
[10:19.74]Wait, there's no sound?
[10:20.68]What do you mean there's no sound?
[10:23.22]What?
[10:25.06]What?
[10:31.37]Let's go... No sound.
[10:37.47]I don't have access to my mouse.
[10:39.38]And I have it in windowed mode.
[10:40.80]What the fuck?
[10:41.52]There's no sound.
[10:44.86]There's so many opportunities for you to hear funny things.
[10:51.93]Oh my god, I really don't have a control.
[10:53.53]I can't even have... I don't have access to my mouse.
[10:57.15]Video games in 2017, everybody.
[11:00.83]I don't... I can't... Give me my fucking mouse.
[11:03.91]Why couldn't you guys hear this?
[11:05.43]Okay, that was dumb.
[11:07.89]That was really dumb.
[11:09.89]Get... Oh my fucking god.
[11:15.48]I hate video games.
[11:21.26]Hey, it was over!
[11:23.26]Equipment.
[11:25.68]I got like a regular mask.
[11:28.32]Tunic.
[11:28.90]None of this matters.
[11:31.81]Encounters alright.
[11:33.57]Let's just go.
[11:34.07]I'm not in any school yet What do I do this is one of those like open-ended exploration games I got one of these This just looks like fire watch I'm not gonna start like complaining about the world in like life and shit am I I'm gonna get a camera Hey, how's school going?
[12:04.98]Okay, I'm dead.
[12:10.97]I wanted to see what happens.
[12:13.77]Motion blur?
[12:14.55]Yeah, let's turn off the motion blur while we're here.
[12:17.80]Graphics.
[12:20.66]Ultra.
[12:21.26]You guys think I have a shitty computer?
[12:23.26]High.
[12:24.30]Everything on high.
[12:25.96]No V-Sync.
[12:26.62]Uh-oh.
[12:32.24]I don't think I can turn off the motion blur.
[12:37.42]Take a look at that computer.
[12:40.01]Yeah, it's alright.
[12:41.77]Only on high.
[12:42.85]That's as high as it goes.
[12:44.37]Oh, no, don't.
[12:45.05]I got it.
[12:45.47]Don't worry.
[12:45.83]We're fine.
[12:47.43]Gameplay?
[12:49.89]Camera speed?
[12:54.00]No.
[12:54.38]No vibration.
[12:55.14]Get that out of here.
[12:56.64]Turn that off permanently.
[12:59.90]Mouse ability?
[13:00.48]Okay, that's fine.
[13:03.97]Alright, let's go.
[13:07.50]Controls?
[13:08.70]Why would it be in controls?
[13:13.24]It's post-processing?
[13:14.48]Well, then we're going to lose how, like, cute it looks.
[13:21.97]Alright, R1.
[13:23.31]R1 is lock.
[13:25.35]Okay.
[13:26.43]Hold.
[13:28.05]Is change target.
[13:29.15]Okay, so you go like this.
[13:31.91]And then you tap it to unlock on somebody.
[13:33.85]Okay, easy enough.
[13:35.70]Nice.
[13:36.66]Cool.
[13:38.54]Game of the year.
[13:39.12]Alright, give me something like brainless zombies to punch.
[13:42.28]Here we go.
[13:42.66]Attack sequences.
[13:43.58]X, X, X. Square, square, square, square, square.
[13:45.88]Attacks consume stamina.
[13:47.79]Yes, they do.
[13:51.53]Game of the year.
[13:55.89]Why am I facing this way?
[13:57.07]Turn this way.
[14:02.51]Why is it freaking out?
[14:11.26]X doesn't do anything.
[14:12.12]Okay, well that's triangle.
[14:18.70]Attacks consume stamina.
[14:23.81]Why is X not doing anything?
[14:28.12]Combat deck.
[14:28.64]Your combat deck has four stances.
[14:30.60]Each starts with different attacks.
[14:32.13]Enter each stance once.
[14:33.91]Well locked.
[14:35.17]Okay.
[14:36.95]So... I gotta press, like, a certain direction?
[14:50.17]R2, well, like, what the fuck is going on?
[14:52.50]R2, R2, R2, R2!
[14:52.98]Why is it doing this?
[14:58.50]Okay.
[15:01.64]Is anybody else getting freaked out by the R2-RT thing?
[15:04.26]Okay, you just took change stances.
[15:07.30]That's cool.
[15:12.32]I understand what it wants me to do, but the whole R2-RT thing is kind of freaking me out.
[15:18.67]Alternative attacks change your stance, allowing you to chain smoothly with other attacks.
[15:21.79]Okay.
[15:22.11]Alright.
[15:27.51]Alright, so triangle changes stances.
[15:31.07]Interesting.
[15:31.49]I'm just wasting stamina, though.
[15:42.66]It seems to always go to the bottom left one.
[15:44.18]I guess I could do this, right?
[15:49.86]Cool.
[15:52.58]Alright, well, let's go.
[15:56.50]Someone's actually going to have a special property.
[16:01.58]I need this stance apparently.
[16:04.54]It's a flaming kick.
[16:06.34]Guard is... Okay.
[16:07.92]Do I need to be... Okay, so it's not like For Honor.
[16:19.15]I see you can feint too.
[16:20.53]Okay.
[16:21.17]That's good to know.
[16:22.75]So I can pretend to attack.
[16:30.00]Let's just block and get it.
[16:31.26]Alright, cool.
[16:42.13]You have Sony and Microsoft controllers plugged in.
[16:44.21]It's switching between inputs.
[16:45.69]No, I don't.
[16:46.91]I don't.
[16:47.33]I swear to God, I don't have Sony and Microsoft controllers plugged in.
[16:54.50]I don't have two controllers plugged in.
[16:56.86]The other thing that's plugged in.
[16:57.92]What is this?
[16:59.41]This is the capture device.
[17:00.60]Now, what is that?
[17:02.80]What is this?
[17:05.36]I'm snaking it right now.
[17:08.14]No, it's my like capture card.
[17:09.96]It's my capture device.
[17:10.80]I don't have two controllers plugged in.
[17:18.79]Oh.
[17:20.89]What the fuck?
[17:22.35]Okay.
[17:25.98]Those are like gear and shit in this game.
[17:28.60]Whoa, there's a guy in here.
[17:29.46]That guy was easy.
[17:35.86]Wow, this game is way easier than Dark Souls.
[17:38.82]That guy would have jumped up and screamed at me.
[17:40.38]Can I climb this?
[17:49.27]Turn off DS4 windows.
[17:50.63]It's alright.
[17:51.29]It's okay.
[17:51.79]I can handle it.
[17:52.83]I'll be okay.
[17:53.29]Now, can we like go online yet?
[18:01.21]BB.
[18:02.35]I don't have another controller plugged in.
[18:05.29]So that's dodge.
[18:06.73]Okay.
[18:07.73]I'm fighting two people at the same time.
[18:18.90]Ooh, that was a pretty sick dodge.
[18:20.88]Why would I do that when I can just hit, like tapping on, that seems to be better.
[18:33.03]Cool.
[18:33.51]Oh, block.
[18:34.57]Easy.
[18:34.85]Aren't I supposed to be fighting other humans in this game?
[18:39.20]Like, I need to get online.
[18:40.06]Dude, there's a person fighting over there.
[18:51.88]Give me the fucking windmill.
[18:54.52]Okay.
[18:56.47]Um.
[18:58.27]Hey, periodically we're going to check and see if Absolver is back online.
[19:02.07]What do you guys say?
[19:06.09]It's like Dark Souls duels.
[19:07.43]That's pretty cool.
[19:09.07]I'm into that.
[19:09.91]Let's sprint.
[19:12.30]I already came up this way, didn't I?
[19:13.62]Yeah, I did.
[19:17.38]Tell me if online starts working.
[19:18.68]Yeah, I guess it's not.
[19:20.08]I love how I picked the perfect time to stream this game.
[19:24.36]Right when the servers don't exist anymore.
[19:28.98]What is this?
[19:31.01]Is this like a challenge where I have to be challenged by the gods?
[19:35.07]Find and defeat Cylan.
[19:37.85]Alright.
[19:40.05]Where's he at?
[19:40.41]Is that him?
[19:41.39]Ooh, what was that?
[19:48.61]What was that little jump rope move?
[19:52.80]I'm assuming those are like leveling up.
[19:54.32]Do you level up your moves?
[19:57.32]As you use them?
[19:58.14]I'm assuming that's kind of what it is.
[20:06.75]Oh, what do you think you got?
[20:07.45]Oh, excuse me.
[20:08.43]Excuse me.
[20:08.83]You just kicked your own friend.
[20:10.55]That's what you get.
[20:17.00]Get him in the fucking wall.
[20:17.82]Level up.
[20:18.24]Meditate.
[20:22.68]What?
[20:24.00]Okay.
[20:25.02]Uh, equipment meditation.
[20:25.91]Meditation.
[20:28.84]Strength?
[20:29.30]Alright, what are we doing here?
[20:30.34]Building strength is not a matter of gaining muscle volume or mass.
[20:33.78]It is about channeling the energy of both the body and the mind from max power.
[20:37.32]Why did I read that?
[20:38.10]Just read the... Don't read the flavor text.
[20:39.66]Just read what it does.
[20:40.34]Increase damage of attacks based on strength.
[20:48.91]Why am I like... It's like skipping.
[20:51.37]When I press up or down.
[20:52.79]Like, is it...
[20:54.60]Anybody else's game doing this or is my fucking computer just freaking out for no reason?
[21:01.07]I didn't even put that point in.
[21:01.95]Increase damage or attack based on dexterity.
[21:05.33]Too many controllers.
[21:06.45]I have one controller plugged in.
[21:09.50]It's DS4 Windows.
[21:12.60]I don't even have that in.
[21:16.76]Guys, I don't have an Xbox controller plugged in.
[21:19.68]You want me to show you on camera?
[21:25.29]I got endurance.
[21:26.79]God.
[21:27.67]Max health.
[21:28.11]How many points do I have?
[21:28.83]One.
[21:32.56]Unplug the Wiimote.
[21:36.04]I don't have any controllers plugged in besides this one.
[21:43.64]I only have two USBs.
[21:48.55]No, that's not it.
[21:50.51]That's not it.
[21:52.47]Evidence is not required here.
[21:55.75]Unplug OBS.
[22:01.11]My Xbox controller is in a box back there in a closet.
[22:06.17]Anyways, thank you, Ghoul Champ, for the $15.
[22:08.13]From my favorite boy.
[22:10.83]Well, thank you, Ghoul Champ.
[22:12.75]Thank you, Soup for the bits.
[22:13.75]Have you ever thought of getting Paul Bearer to scream at you so you can hear sub notifications?
[22:18.11]I feel like, yeah, it isn't crazy enough.
[22:19.95]Yeah, but like, Paul Bearer is like too crazy.
[22:25.45]Use the Xbox controller instead.
[22:28.57]No, I'm not using DS4 Windows.
[22:31.63]I just have it plugged in through Steam.
[22:35.33]Steam recognizes my PS4 controller.
[22:39.05]I don't have DS4 Windows or anything.
[22:42.85]But thank you.
[22:43.55]I appreciate the help.
[22:46.93]Jabu, thank you.
[22:48.02]Juba, thanks for the $5.
[22:48.88]Do you really have diarrhea every morning?
[22:50.68]Usually.
[22:51.74]Usually.
[22:54.23]Uh, thank you, though.
[22:55.69]Appreciate it.
[22:58.93]What, do you think I might have just, like, DS4 drivers or something?
[23:01.26]That's weird.
[23:01.72]I don't know why that would be the case.
[23:03.84]But, uh, let's go with... I'm gonna go safe here.
[23:06.88]It's either endurance or vitality.
[23:08.54]I'm gonna go with health.
[23:09.50]Just because I'm a baby and I'm terrified.
[23:14.61]Alright, it's in health.
[23:16.55]We're doing... I don't want to die.
[23:19.09]I got new equipment, too, apparently.
[23:21.54]Shoulder pads, what do I get?
[23:22.46]A nice like ribbon.
[23:25.16]Protection from blunt and cut.
[23:26.48]Is there a weapons in this game?
[23:28.63]I lose mobility though.
[23:31.75]I got a new face mask.
[23:35.27]It's the same thing, it just looks cooler.
[23:38.13]Okay.
[23:44.05]Steam PS, like optimizations.
[23:46.41]I don't think I am.
[23:50.01]Alright, we'll get less damage.
[23:53.59]Let's get more protections on here, though.
[23:56.43]New pants?
[23:57.15]Where did I get all this?
[23:57.91]Where did I get this, like, Sorcerer's Apprentice outfit?
[24:03.48]I have no idea.
[24:05.44]Let's keep going.
[24:06.02]We gotta go find Simon.
[24:11.18]Avoid.
[24:11.56]Yeah, that's what I was doing.
[24:14.18]I like avoid more than I like dodge.
[24:15.94]I feel like it's quicker.
[24:19.61]Oh, that's duck.
[24:20.37]Okay, I gotta duck under this.
[24:21.59]I gotta try to get this right.
[24:25.01]Just like that.
[24:27.61]Just like that.
[24:29.03]Switch the stance up a little bit.
[24:30.01]Fucking jump back, windmill kick.
[24:32.25]End her.
[24:33.51]Got it.
[24:39.32]Oh, it's a dummy.
[24:39.92]Okay.
[24:40.46]That's just a mannequin.
[24:42.08]I was confused there for a second.
[24:43.54]I thought that was a bad guy.
[24:49.31]Shortcut nice Just got a Dark Souls.
[24:53.73]This really is like Dark Souls, but PvP, but not at all Like not even close, but it is it's close.
[24:59.73]It's close enough, but it's not even close Got a guy coming on the corner here comes the first like Dark Souls jump scare This guy's gonna jump around the quarter and go Yeah, there he is oh there he is there's the door guardian oh
[25:22.37]Let's change it up a little.
[25:25.72]I'm running out of stamina.
[25:26.52]I gotta be careful here.
[25:29.40]Oh, nice dodge.
[25:31.10]Nice dodge, dude.
[25:39.62]Oh, that's a pretty good sequence.
[25:46.01]Dude, if I'm getting shoutcasted right now, the casters would have been like, dude, what a sequence that was.
[25:50.59]Jerma985 really took it another level.
[25:55.15]Beautiful dash there.
[25:56.51]Beautiful dodge there.
[26:06.34]Sorry about the lapse of judgment in my brain.
[26:09.54]I don't know what that was.
[26:12.58]Really took it to another level there.
[26:18.64]Here, I gotta go down here.
[26:19.57]I'll put up the secret door.
[26:22.55]Off of the guy's soul.
[26:23.41]Alright, servers back online?
[26:28.99]Do we have servers?
[26:30.17]1, 2, 3, just like that.
[26:41.55]I hear somebody.
[26:43.24]I hear somebody.
[26:45.02]Let's go with...
[26:48.27]I can't kick down any doors?
[26:49.43]What?
[26:51.89]Do I play Roblox?
[26:53.05]I do not.
[26:55.05]Guard allows you to cancel an attack.
[26:56.34]Yeah, I know.
[26:58.32]But I don't know.
[26:59.20]Do I have to do that?
[27:00.38]These aren't even real people.
[27:01.92]These are fake people.
[27:03.87]Wait, what?
[27:05.61]Wasn't I already here?
[27:19.35]Is there like a backstab move?
[27:25.73]Apparently not.
[27:28.10]Okay.
[27:33.16]Back to the pit.
[27:34.26]I don't know.
[27:34.80]Where we belong.
[27:37.60]Is there like a jump?
[27:44.56]deckhead.
[27:45.28]Did I go the wrong way?
[27:46.78]Why am I so confused right now?
[27:47.90]Didn't I go through like it said kill this guy and then go to the next area?
[27:52.54]Who knew opening a door was so complicated?
[27:55.10]Did I not go through the fucking door right?
[27:57.16]Here it is.
[27:58.90]What?
[28:04.21]I didn't even open the door.
[28:07.67]What a dummy.
[28:10.17]Servers are up!
[28:12.25]Servers are up!
[28:17.69]Are they?
[28:27.59]You unlocked it when you killed the boss.
[28:29.07]Is this a bad guy?
[28:31.19]I am Talim.
[28:31.77]I will try to help you as you progress, but if you lose yourself to the Fold, I won't be able to save you.
[28:36.33]Those who wear the mask are not all your enemies, you know.
[28:38.05]I will not attack you.
[28:39.59]When you're safe, you can enter meditation and practice your combat deck.
[28:43.77]In meditation, you can practice and edit your combat deck.
[28:51.35]combat deck practice in the practice mode you can edit your combat deck stances oh lord okay this is this is this is complicated a little just a little bit alright alternative attacks square attacks x attacks
[29:18.57]So this is... Why is X not doing anything?
[29:25.28]Like... When I press X, nothing happens.
[29:29.34]Isn't that supposed to be another move?
[29:33.40]Or is that only in a specific stance?
[29:34.83]Because pressing X does absolutely fucking nothing.
[29:40.79]Square does, and triangle does, but X does not.
[29:49.50]X is for your other controller.
[29:54.15]God damn it.
[29:58.17]What?
[29:58.97]No, it's not.
[30:00.37]Oh my god, this is fucking freaking me out.
[30:03.15]Why?
[30:10.62]Come on, you guys give me a break.
[30:13.92]It's showing me inputs, and I have those inputs on my controller.
[30:22.06]Okay, why does it change sometimes?
[30:27.52]Let's take a look.
[30:28.28]So this is just 1, 2, 3, 4.
[30:32.12]1, 2, 3.
[30:34.15]Okay, so that's just like twice.
[30:37.89]Okay, let me go back to edit my deck.
[30:41.10]This is bottom here.
[30:42.45]So this goes bang, bang.
[30:45.51]What's the other thing I can do?
[30:47.59]That one's 60 damage.
[30:48.87]Finish in this as you get that.
[30:52.15]Finish up here.
[30:52.83]I don't really have any extra moves.
[30:57.26]So if I start down here, it's like a kick sequence.
[30:59.54]Okay.
[31:02.18]Let's go down here and just see what it looks like.
[31:09.87]Stay down here, man.
[31:20.17]Why can't I stay down here?
[31:26.78]Shouldn't I be able to stay in that stance?
[31:28.82]I don't understand.
[31:29.52]Why does it keep going to this one?
[31:33.32]I'm on the right hand.
[31:38.05]Streamer is confused.
[31:38.87]It's the battery-operated shit inputs.
[31:44.51]Um...
[31:48.41]This is actually kind of confusing the absolute fuck out of me.
[31:50.95]I'm not going to lie.
[31:52.99]How come I can't do these?
[31:54.13]I don't have these yet or something?
[31:55.69]Is that only for certain builds?
[32:02.10]Like C, B?
[32:02.38]Everything has a scale?
[32:06.22]Fix my controller?
[32:07.06]I wish that... Look.
[32:07.84]I just ripped it out.
[32:16.78]Nope.
[32:18.74]Using configs from Greg.
[32:20.08]Alright, hold on.
[32:22.18]What if I... You learn moves by observing them.
[32:26.13]Okay.
[32:35.57]So that's alternative... So you have to jump between stances in the middle of punches and stuff.
[32:49.34]I guess.
[32:52.84]I don't really care.
[32:53.90]This is fine for me.
[32:57.70]I guess I can put something else here.
[32:59.44]Do you want to continue?
[33:05.30]Sure.
[33:06.73]So what does this one do?
[33:08.37]That's in this top left and then top... Wait, what?
[33:11.05]What are you talking about?
[33:11.81]What the fuck is this?
[33:15.49]Top left is like a spin.
[33:19.61]I want to add this.
[33:23.41]Yeah, my PS4 controller really wants to be an Xbox controller.
[33:29.55]Let me see this one more time.
[33:30.31]So this is top left.
[33:32.25]And then top right.
[33:35.61]Oh my god.
[33:36.38]This controller thing is starting to actually piss me off.
[33:38.66]I need to figure it out.
[33:43.60]Will that work?
[33:48.14]Just unplug the power cord.
[33:50.96]Okay, let's try that.
[33:54.60]Oh, so it does it automatically.
[33:58.64]So it just jumps around from... So if I start in here... Okay.
[34:04.21]I'm starting to figure this out a little.
[34:07.31]So if I start up here in the top right, then I can go from top right... What does this move?
[34:14.09]It's an elbow.
[34:17.92]Top right, top right.
[34:18.72]Let's see what this does.
[34:21.29]But it's top right, top left.
[34:24.73]No, no, no.
[34:25.43]Continue, yes.
[34:29.52]Oh my god.
[34:30.04]Please, controller, stop sucking ass.
[34:38.56]Okay.
[34:41.28]So it's really just you can put pretty much anything there then, huh?
[34:45.23]Can I do like the punch, then the kick?
[34:57.42]I have to figure this out, because it's doing inputs twice in a row.
[35:02.36]When I try to move the controller, it just skips sometimes.
[35:05.24]This is just fucking stupid.
[35:06.36]Give me a second.
[35:06.72]I'll be right back.
[35:07.20]I've got to figure out why the fuck this is happening.
[35:24.29]Alright, I got it.
[35:45.86]I figured it out.
[35:48.24]I had to like disable the steam overlay.
[35:51.82]Because it was trying to take over.
[35:53.18]That's much better.
[35:54.72]That was big picture mode.
[35:56.24]What the fuck?
[35:56.78]Steam?
[35:57.02]What the hell is Steam doing?
[36:04.46]Different ending quadrant?
[36:10.48]Let me just see.
[36:11.38]What did I do?
[36:12.64]I can only do a certain amount of things.
[36:14.68]I can't start this one here then, right?
[36:16.38]Can I?
[36:17.02]Already equipped.
[36:17.60]No.
[36:17.88]Don't do it then.
[36:21.14]These are all already equipped.
[36:22.26]I can't... Alright.
[36:22.98]I don't think I can really do anything because these are all already equipped.
[36:25.68]So we're just going to keep going.
[36:31.57]Buy the alligator.
[36:32.65]Okay, let's go.
[36:33.23]Let's just look at tips for a second.
[36:36.21]Shard powers, weapons, durability... There's a lot of information here.
[36:42.17]Let's just baptism by fire.
[36:46.00]Exit practice.
[36:47.68]Deck one, bare hands...
[36:50.21]War gloves, sword, deck.
[36:51.92]I don't even have a sword.
[36:55.56]So, whatever.
[36:57.52]I gotta get more moves before this ever becomes a thing.
[36:59.72]I think I leveled up, though, didn't I?
[37:00.64]Yeah, I did.
[37:04.30]Do you want to do decks?
[37:06.50]Yeah, we'll do... No, let's do another point.
[37:08.32]Decks.
[37:08.84]Why not?
[37:09.48]Sure.
[37:12.85]Now I can actually not be confused by this game.
[37:19.87]Alright, let's go.
[37:22.99]I also want to try to turn the servers on.
[37:30.47]Am I at a save point where I'm able to do that?
[37:36.11]Where's my windmill move?
[37:40.96]Do I get a fucking hit every person move?
[37:46.08]Alright, I'm going to focus on her.
[37:48.67]Yeah, good.
[37:49.51]Well, your partner's a fucking idiot.
[37:53.91]I'll take that on.
[38:00.10]So I'm watching him do these things, and it's doing a bar for me.
[38:03.64]Interestingly enough.
[38:11.23]This is kind of just like a couple of drunk guys.
[38:13.43]Alright, I unlocked a jab punch.
[38:15.69]Okay, good.
[38:17.67]You just got a bunch of martial arts experts shit-faced and threw them into the same place.
[38:26.72]Rush.
[38:27.28]Okay.
[38:27.76]I'm gonna ring the bell.
[38:33.16]I was trying to jump off the cliff.
[38:35.46]I was trying to die in the cutscene.
[38:36.68]I don't think you can.
[38:37.28]I should be saved now.
[38:47.05]Anybody know if we got servers yet?
[38:55.11]Ringing bells.
[38:55.87]Hey, thank you, debauchery.
[38:58.43]Thank you, debauchery, for the 10 bucks.
[38:59.63]Here's 10 bucks for the Get Terma Esteem Control.
[39:02.24]Fine.
[39:02.42]I have Esteem Control.
[39:03.46]I don't have it plugged in.
[39:05.24]I'm not a huge fan of it.
[39:06.64]I think it's not that good.
[39:09.52]But thank you for the 10 bucks, debauchery.
[39:11.66]Thank you for the 10... Again, debauchery.
[39:13.50]Thank you for the $20 total.
[39:16.41]Uh, here's 10 bucks for the get Jerma and Xbox One controller fun.
[39:20.03]No, I already have I have all the controllers I'm not going to use the steam controller But thank you debauchery for the uh, the 20 bucks debauchery man dan with wings.
[39:29.23]Thanks for the five dollars here use this to rent a warehouse Imagine if it was five dollars to rent a warehouse.
[39:35.22]Holy shit, that'd be unbelievable I would live in it.
[39:39.42]I would just live there I would set up like a hundred cameras and just like walk around and just stream it
[39:45.74]Thank you, Ghoul Champ, for the $15.
[39:46.88]For my favorite boy.
[39:50.10]Yeah, thank you.
[39:51.46]Appreciate it.
[39:56.68]So, do we know if the servers are back online?
[39:59.14]Have we determined that yet?
[40:02.04]Can we play this with other humans?
[40:08.43]Warehouses are pretty cool.
[40:09.51]They are.
[40:11.31]Yeah.
[40:16.36]Just check.
[40:19.47]Let's check it.
[40:20.85]Quick game.
[40:22.89]Servers are up?
[40:23.59]Okay.
[40:25.01]Let's go connect to them then.
[40:29.95]Okay.
[40:30.83]Options.
[40:32.11]Offline mode.
[40:33.01]No.
[40:36.34]Come on.
[40:37.46]Get me on there.
[40:43.60]Connecting to server.
[40:44.32]Come on.
[40:48.34]Come on.
[40:52.72]Server connection failed.
[40:53.82]Dude, the game came out today.
[40:57.95]The game was in like fucking beta like a week ago.
[41:00.27]And you tell me the servers aren't online the day the game releases?
[41:05.09]No way.
[41:11.91]I'm just gonna restart the game.
[41:12.81]Give me a second.
[41:17.59]Give me one second.
[41:18.61]We're going to restart it.
[41:22.39]Too many people are trying to connect.
[41:25.09]Well, like... I don't get it.
[41:29.78]I don't understand how that happens.
[41:40.06]Uninstall and refund.
[41:41.36]No.
[41:46.09]Come on.
[41:53.27]then you don't understand servers, probably.
[41:55.27]No, I do.
[41:58.09]But I mean, look, the game's been out for like, the game's been out for like 10 hours at this point.
[42:06.34]Plugins, alright, well, we're gonna have to stay in offline mode, apparently.
[42:12.54]At least they have this.
[42:14.98]If they didn't, that would be a fucking joke.
[42:16.58]It would be a disaster.
[42:23.21]Dude, somebody, like, plug in.
[42:24.82]Just go to, like, servers.com and just buy, like, 500 more of them.
[42:40.12]The devs aren't expecting 15,000 players to be online.
[42:44.96]Yeah, so go to, like, fucking servershoster.org and buy a thousand of them.
[42:56.43]I'm assuming this is like a hub world, kind of.
[43:00.01]Altar, okay.
[43:01.09]The Altar.
[43:03.96]That's where I am.
[43:04.50]I guess we can go left.
[43:07.22]I'm assuming the red blips are bad guys.
[43:10.42]To become an Absolver, you need to prove your worth and defeat Raizerin in the Hanging Gardens of the Tower of Adal.
[43:15.98]Okay.
[43:17.02]Okay.
[43:18.66]But first, you must beat Caretz in the Colosseum, Kilnor and her brother Kargal in the old birdhouse, and the six marked ones roaming the city in the forest.
[43:28.47]Okay.
[43:32.21]So we just gotta... We gotta go kill bosses.
[43:35.61]Beware these foes.
[43:36.27]They will not be defeated easily.
[43:40.44]Okie dokie.
[43:42.52]I'm assuming there's nothing else I can really do here then, right?
[43:48.62]I love how I'm looking over and people are just like, server's a backup.
[43:51.81]I can't trust any of you guys.
[44:00.15]We're gonna go this way.
[44:04.61]Server's a back online.
[44:08.33]Okay, here we go.
[44:15.95]I don't have access to any combos or anything yet.
[44:17.51]I'm just kind of running around.
[44:18.40]Hunting path.
[44:23.86]Saving.
[44:27.20]What else we got?
[44:32.67]Nope.
[44:33.19]That's blocked off.
[44:35.95]Should I play New Vegas instead?
[44:37.37]I haven't played New Vegas in like a year.
[44:40.59]I'm not gonna just play New Vegas.
[44:41.92]Do I still have it installed?
[44:45.84]Well, that's not the right thing I wanted to do.
[44:47.32]Eh, come on.
[44:54.44]Bring it to me.
[45:00.99]Got him.
[45:03.65]Just play old Vegas.
[45:08.19]Uh, guy over here.
[45:09.15]Is there a sneak button?
[45:10.15]I don't think there is.
[45:19.05]Okay, I gotta change my layout.
[45:21.13]It's kind of stupid right now.
[45:23.57]I'll take that.
[45:24.07]Ooh, nice dodge.
[45:37.04]Put the blocks up.
[45:37.74]Put the hands up.
[45:40.96]Level up.
[45:44.39]Open, open, pick it up.
[45:46.21]Bracelet's cool.
[45:50.81]Meditate.
[45:53.23]So, dexterity... Strength, my hands, and dexterity, my feet.
[45:59.95]Right?
[46:04.43]Mobility... I mean, is it worth... I'm doing a lot of punches.
[46:13.20]I guess my damage only goes up by... I don't know.
[46:18.42]I guess I'm not just sure what moves take what.
[46:23.68]What about my shoulders, knees, and toes?
[46:29.62]Vitality is the shit.
[46:33.71]Strength is hands.
[46:35.03]All my attacks are just based on decks anyways.
[46:36.85]Alright, we're just going to dump it all into decks.
[46:41.03]It's probably a terrible idea.
[46:43.57]I need to go in here and I need to edit this.
[46:45.39]I need to get a good combo with this.
[46:53.09]This has to be here.
[46:54.89]Because that doesn't work that way.
[46:56.75]This kick now needs to be followed up with... This is not a finishing move.
[47:02.93]I unlocked something else though, didn't I?
[47:09.08]How do I already have that equipped?
[47:13.40]Do I already have that equipped?
[47:16.92]I don't though.
[47:21.46]I guess I do.
[47:25.84]I'd much rather have it, like, happen by pressing square, though.
[47:28.18]Let me just try this.
[47:32.30]Yeah, that's much cooler.
[47:35.24]And then this up here.
[47:36.04]Alright, I get it.
[47:37.45]Alright, I get it.
[47:51.18]He gets it.
[47:51.70]Alright, let's get out of there.
[47:59.15]When does the Garfield Cart stream?
[48:01.06]I'm never going to play Garfield Cart.
[48:03.24]You know what?
[48:03.62]What system is it on?
[48:07.26]I don't like these.
[48:08.18]Cut?
[48:09.39]Actually, we haven't seen a sword yet, so I'm not going to do that.
[48:13.27]I'll hold back.
[48:16.69]Oh, servers are online.
[48:18.21]Let's go.
[48:20.88]This whole, okay, this game is supposed to be played with like a bunch of people concurrently.
[48:25.36]Like MMO, hostile, and like I'm just walking around picking my ass in the single player offline mode.
[48:36.08]Look at me, I'm just walking around aimlessly.
[48:38.92]There's supposed to be like dozens of people in this game with me.
[48:49.80]Forgotten Temple.
[48:51.42]Is there a boss up there?
[48:57.76]We're going to clear out all the bosses.
[48:59.17]That's what it said, right?
[49:01.07]Alright, there's a boss.
[49:05.93]Ooh, nice.
[49:06.93]Ooh!
[49:07.95]Ooh!
[49:08.71]This boss knows what he's doing.
[49:19.02]Damn it.
[49:22.30]I'm gonna duck under his punch.
[49:25.14]Ducked!
[49:27.04]Fucking duck tails, woo woo!
[49:28.66]Come on, swing.
[49:36.52]Swing.
[49:40.24]Dammit.
[49:45.46]This guy's kicking my ass.
[49:46.68]Come here!
[49:47.06]Alright, have patience.
[49:50.47]Why does this guy have so many more moves than me?
[49:52.69]Fuck you!
[49:53.69]How come you get like four chained moves and I only get two?
[49:56.83]That's not fair.
[49:57.49]I just dodged it.
[50:01.38]That guy keeps me right in the fucking head.
[50:02.92]Alright, hold on a second.
[50:09.18]How is that fair?
[50:13.82]That's not fair at all.
[50:20.07]Are these guys like five times stronger than me?
[50:22.29]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[50:23.25]I'm about to lose.
[50:31.34]So this is just like Dark Souls.
[50:33.74]You're not just gonna fight one guy, you're gonna fight him and his invading dickhead friend.
[50:37.42]This is just Dark Souls invasions.
[50:48.70]I'm about to lose stamina.
[50:58.35]God damn it.
[51:00.41]What the fuck?
[51:09.50]Where do I even spawn?
[51:13.00]It's just getting ganked by a computer.
[51:18.48]I'm glad they gave me two dickhead moves.
[51:24.65]Alright, let's fight these two guys.
[51:25.87]Let's fight this guy again.
[51:27.71]He has like five separate kicks and like a shadow dash.
[51:31.39]And I have punch you once and kick you once and then kick you.
[51:35.25]One, one, two, move.
[51:40.94]What the hell was that?
[51:47.08]Come here.
[51:58.63]You can string too many things together.
[51:59.71]I don't like that.
[52:04.33]Come on, do it again.
[52:15.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[52:16.77]Don't get your friend down here.
[52:18.77]Do not bring your friend down here.
[52:20.09]Oh my, now you got tucked.
[52:21.15]Come on.
[52:22.33]What is this shit?
[52:27.03]Good, good sweep.
[52:33.96]Good.
[52:34.98]Alright, we got it.
[52:41.82]No, no, don't run, don't run, don't run.
[52:42.98]Come here.
[52:43.22]I don't want to be a guy behind me and a guy next to me.
[52:50.50]Come here, you fucking idiot.
[52:56.42]He's got, like, haymakered.
[53:07.00]He dodges, and then I get kicked, and then he dodges, and I get kicked from behind.
[53:18.98]Jesus Christ.
[53:22.74]Let me look at something for a second here.
[53:24.14]I feel like there's something wrong.
[53:28.87]Actually, I don't think there is anything wrong.
[53:30.65]I just have to be up there to do that.
[53:47.28]Uh, okay.
[53:49.32]I can, like, dance for a second if I go down here.
[53:53.67]I was gonna block the punches with my face.
[53:56.05]That's a good tactic.
[53:58.91]Just spam, jab, and win?
[54:00.33]No, I can't do that.
[54:09.12]Do I unlock more than two moves in a sequence?
[54:12.16]Does that ever happen?
[54:12.88]I don't know.
[54:19.17]And up here is... It's got to be... How do I do that move?
[54:31.44]I'm going to do this move.
[54:34.94]It needs to be top left into top right.
[54:36.80]Okay, so it's got to be up here.
[54:41.44]This is the move that's going to catch a lot of people off guard.
[54:47.84]That's fine.
[54:48.32]Let's go.
[54:49.66]Let's keep it up.
[54:52.20]Use alternative decks to chain combos.
[54:57.12]Sword.
[54:57.68]I really want to use a weapon.
[54:58.54]I feel like that would be a lot of fun.
[55:02.24]Well, I got the two guys.
[55:03.20]How do you heal?
[55:03.94]Is there a heal or anything like that?
[55:05.62]Can I drink out of the dirty fountain?
[55:12.24]Shoes.
[55:13.68]Well.
[55:15.24]New shoes.
[55:15.86]Shoes.
[55:19.14]That's a lot of defense.
[55:21.48]I'm going to put him on.
[55:22.10]I have to kill people to heal.
[55:25.04]Okay.
[55:26.96]Understandable.
[55:28.14]Left on the D-pad.
[55:31.42]That actually was right.
[55:32.60]That was true.
[55:35.34]How many times do I get to use that?
[55:41.62]Shit.
[55:44.51]Come here.
[55:44.83]Stop running away from me.
[55:54.13]Maybe that isn't the greatest move.
[55:58.77]No, it's not.
[56:00.17]I gotta, like, use that later.
[56:01.13]Alright, let's trip this guy.
[56:14.24]Give me stamina back.
[56:18.85]I keep going for, like, the fucking heel kick.
[56:21.13]It's not gonna work.
[56:32.40]You can't block that much.
[56:33.30]Give me a break.
[56:46.89]What?
[56:47.35]Come on.
[56:50.21]Oh, my God.
[56:50.57]Please just fucking punch this guy and die.
[56:52.49]Like, holy shit.
[56:59.01]Like, just kill him.
[57:01.05]For the love of God.
[57:03.20]For the love of all that is holy.
[57:05.58]In heaven.
[57:11.85]Just go play Nintendogs.
[57:14.17]You know, I actually own Nintendogs.
[57:16.77]Now that you remind me, what a great game.
[57:18.29]Nintendogs is like one of the best games ever.
[57:24.34]You just like get a funny, like, cute dog.
[57:31.88]He's dead.
[57:33.44]I figured it out.
[57:34.02]Let's go.
[57:35.50]You have to get my DS equipped.
[57:38.95]Get what?
[57:39.43]I have to equip my DS.
[57:45.89]What did I unlock?
[57:49.05]Did I unlock something new?
[57:52.97]Not quite.
[57:53.45]Where is this used?
[57:56.74]I have three of these death moves, don't I?
[57:58.30]No, I only have two.
[57:59.82]This is like the guard breaker.
[58:04.58]Strong impact on guard.
[58:05.98]So that's like the get out of guard free card.
[58:08.10]I don't think I unlocked anything.
[58:15.79]What about this one?
[58:18.45]Let's start with that one.
[58:21.05]This one's quicker.
[58:21.73]Okay, so we're going to go jab punch.
[58:30.96]I like that one.
[58:33.83]This one will happen a little faster now.
[58:35.10]How fast is this?
[58:37.20]It's okay.
[58:40.44]It's fine.
[58:40.84]Let me just see what that does.
[58:49.06]Yeah, that happens much faster.
[58:50.49]It's a little left jab, and that's the punch I'm looking for.
[58:58.59]Let me see.
[59:01.13]What is Dex?
[59:01.85]Dex is the hand, right?
[59:02.87]Dex is always the guy giving a high five, right?
[59:12.71]Hold on.
[59:12.97]Let me start with this one.
[59:16.46]I need to look at these.
[59:17.26]Okay, so...
[59:19.64]The guy giving a high five.
[59:21.04]That's E. That scales with Dex, but not that great.
[59:24.18]D. B. Okay, this actually is better.
[59:27.76]It is better.
[59:28.58]Damn it.
[59:29.02]Okay.
[59:30.90]What about this one?
[59:31.84]D. A. So this one does scale with Dex better.
[59:41.56]Well, unfortunately, that's the case.
[59:47.30]Unplug my Pokédex.
[59:51.54]Alright.
[59:53.94]Wait, dex is the fushi circle, strength is the triangle.
[59:59.89]Is it?
[60:01.03]No, dex is always the hand, isn't it?
[60:05.79]No, dex is always the hand.
[60:08.45]Always.
[60:14.45]Wait, I leveled up.
[60:14.97]Let's go back here.
[60:17.62]Strength...
[60:19.92]I feel like I should put, like, another point into, like, endurance.
[60:25.76]No, health.
[60:31.64]Are there any things in this game that require you to max something out?
[60:36.80]Like, do you need, like, 20 points in the decks or, like, 15 points in the decks or something?
[60:41.30]Or is it just... It just doesn't matter.
[60:49.32]I need to go to school.
[60:50.14]I really do.
[60:51.36]I need to get online is what I need to have happen.
[60:54.28]Alright, where am I at?
[60:59.22]Is there like a map I can look at?
[61:04.41]Get decks.
[61:05.21]I think I cleared this place out.
[61:10.97]I think I've absolved this whole area.
[61:15.95]Pretty much besides this guy.
[61:16.99]And this is the boss.
[61:18.15]You can tell because he has a pink mohawk.
[61:20.79]This is the last guy here.
[61:22.50]See, this is the thing on the ground.
[61:24.62]He's going to stand up.
[61:30.44]I just took his sword.
[61:32.10]He's an NPC.
[61:33.92]You want to survive, you have to have more attacks.
[61:36.84]If an unknown attack hits your guard, you will start learning it.
[61:40.99]See, just to absorb knowledge by getting punched.
[61:42.99]Okay.
[61:44.29]If you use your combat style's ability against that attack, you will learn it even faster.
[61:51.04]But if you are defeated or flee combat, you will lose all this experience.
[61:54.04]Victory is the only path to acquiring knowledge.
[62:03.40]Okay.
[62:04.26]Well, now I have a sword.
[62:05.08]Oh, Jesus.
[62:07.61]Now you're going to give me another fucking moveset to look at?
[62:11.68]No, don't throw that on the ground.
[62:12.55]What are you doing?
[62:15.95]I want to practice.
[62:18.55]Practice with the sword.
[62:21.67]Alright, what do we got?
[62:25.69]B. B. B. I guess it's just already there.
[62:32.52]Swing, swing.
[62:33.24]There's no end on this one, though.
[62:40.14]I already have this one equipped.
[62:42.21]Let's go with the kick.
[62:44.03]That sounds like a good idea.
[62:46.87]Bang and then kick.
[62:48.37]I like it.
[62:54.09]Cool.
[62:55.77]Alright.
[63:01.08]I'm okay with it.
[63:03.94]Study the beer.
[63:04.66]Alright.
[63:10.98]Let's keep going.
[63:13.39]Thank you, Muse.
[63:14.77]Chunky baloney.
[63:16.27]Slims and no soup for you for the bits.
[63:17.83]And Mystic Clay, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[63:22.89]Thank you so much, dude.
[63:24.32]They say, I was watching Roboz play.
[63:26.88]That's a different guy.
[63:27.60]Somebody played New Vegas and he had a car mod.
[63:32.20]I should go get the car mod for Fallout New Vegas.
[63:35.18]Well, I don't know.
[63:35.84]I'll have to take a look at it.
[63:38.10]But thank you, Mystic Clay, Mystic Slay, for the 10 bucks.
[63:43.85]And they say, Jeremy, can you finish the Ferris wheel story?
[63:46.53]God fucking damn it, dude.
[63:49.01]I just had to walk forward.
[63:52.97]I didn't know this was going to happen.
[63:53.99]I didn't know you could even fall in the swamp.
[63:56.97]I didn't even know that was possible.
[64:00.95]I know I lost the sword.
[64:03.67]Telling me that these characters are such dipshits that they can't even walk in like two inches of water I have my fucking face on and everybody's respawned.
[64:13.06]Oh No fucking way man.
[64:15.28]Not a chance in God why what?
[64:21.01]Come on.
[64:22.35]Give me the sword You've got to be shitting me at the servers online yet.
[64:27.13]Do we have servers?
[64:28.17]Oh?
[64:33.21]Just give me the sword.
[64:34.39]Yeah.
[64:38.31]Come on.
[64:39.85]Somebody's a little upset-y spaghetti.
[64:41.83]Uh, wouldn't you?
[64:43.77]Wouldn't you be a little upset-y spaghetti if you just cleared a whole area and then you like took your eyes off the screen and walked into a swamp?
[64:52.53]I would be because it just happened to me and I know what it feels like.
[64:59.82]You can't block a sword like that, dude.
[65:01.30]Come on.
[65:02.24]Get a grip.
[65:14.51]Sword, like... Sword ain't even really that good.
[65:22.59]How do you block that move?
[65:25.79]That guy blocked that, like, super kick?
[65:28.23]I beg to differ, man.
[65:33.39]It worked for you.
[65:34.11]You're in.
[65:34.49]Try the server now.
[65:36.09]Next save point I will.
[65:37.19]I ain't fucking around again.
[65:37.97]We're going to slide tackle this guy and be done with it.
[65:42.20]I missed.
[65:48.10]I didn't believe blocking punches more, right?
[65:49.96]Because that's how you learn new moves.
[65:51.04]Something like that, right?
[65:56.72]Sweep the leg.
[65:58.84]Just like in the Karate Kid.
[66:00.02]Sweep the leg, right?
[66:10.81]Sweep the leg.
[66:12.67]Just like in Mortal Kombat.
[66:13.77]Remember fucking Mortal Kombat 2?
[66:14.93]Hey, if any of you guys ever play Mortal Kombat with your friends, use this secret tactic.
[66:20.81]Just do the leg sweep and they will never get to play the game.
[66:23.76]You can't get out of it.
[66:24.36]It's an inescapable move.
[66:25.58]You can't win.
[66:27.72]Try it.
[66:28.36]You hold down and kick and it's the... Do that until you win.
[66:34.68]It's impossible to win against.
[66:37.62]Like, I'm surprised nobody brings that to tournaments.
[66:43.31]Like, why wouldn't you?
[66:46.45]Are they like Mortal Kombat 2 tournaments?
[66:48.07]I should sign up for one and win.
[66:51.85]Why would I put this on?
[66:52.53]It's worse.
[66:59.23]There's a thing to touch over here.
[67:03.59]Activate the altar.
[67:06.54]And then interact with the altar.
[67:09.52]Okay, so it looks like there is...
[67:13.29]There's a guy over here.
[67:15.95]Apparently, like, over here.
[67:18.85]Guy in here?
[67:19.41]Alright, there's a guy in here.
[67:21.09]There's gonna be a named enemy.
[67:23.62]There he is.
[67:24.54]Angril.
[67:25.38]He's really angry.
[67:29.22]What was that?
[67:29.90]He just did something weird to me.
[67:33.16]Yeah, eat that fucking Grendel.
[67:41.65]Easy.
[67:42.04]It's like a boss.
[67:43.12]Play it smart.
[67:52.66]Get my stamina back.
[67:53.56]Thought I was going to catch him with that.
[68:02.65]Did not.
[68:05.45]Who's going to blink first?
[68:15.78]Ooh, what a fucking duck that was.
[68:18.14]And can you believe Jeremy almost just said my full name.
[68:22.89]Took out that one guy.
[68:24.35]Okay, no, some more talking.
[68:25.53]Just fucking beat him.
[68:35.18]Alright, I need stamina.
[68:36.22]Bad.
[68:37.44]Back it up.
[68:37.96]Back it up.
[68:38.48]Back it up.
[68:42.54]He's just slapping his hands, huh?
[68:51.09]What is that?
[68:51.65]What is he doing?
[68:56.13]This is like the fucking absorb move he's doing.
[68:57.87]It's really annoying.
[69:10.44]I'm gonna like lose to the fucking guy that like turns blue.
[69:14.44]What the fuck is that move?
[69:15.60]And why has it not told me what that move is?
[69:22.08]Like, what was he fucking doing?
[69:24.57]Why was he... Oh my god.
[69:31.03]I have to learn what that... I have to learn what that fucking move is before I know what the move is.
[69:36.93]What?
[69:41.79]I have to learn what that move is before I know what the move is.
[69:44.45]How?
[69:45.72]It's like he's absorbing my attacks.
[69:47.06]How do I get away from that?
[69:47.90]How do I stop that?
[69:50.97]It's the other fighting style.
[69:52.15]Well, tell me what it is!
[69:53.03]Why won't it tell me what it is?
[69:56.78]Be careful, this guy turns blue.
[70:02.44]And by the way, where are the other like 30 fucking people that are supposed to be in my game right now?
[70:06.78]I have to one-on-one 1v1 the boss.
[70:09.79]That's not how it works.
[70:10.49]There's like 30 people that are circling around kicking each other in the dick.
[70:13.35]Like circling me.
[70:14.75]I'm going to lose because I'm like just fucking tilted right now.
[70:17.25]I want to play the fucking game online.
[70:18.62]Like I bought the game.
[70:19.64]I want to play the fucking game online.
[70:23.12]You dog shit goddamn motherfucking game.
[70:28.48]And why is he not attacking me?
[70:32.57]Was I complaining too much?
[70:35.69]Just fucking kill me.
[70:40.73]Now you're just like taunting me.
[70:50.46]Dude, you fucking slide like $30 to a game company and they're like, hey, the whole game's a fucking massive online game.
[70:56.18]It's so much fun.
[70:57.04]Day one, don't ever play them.
[71:00.29]Come back in like three days.
[71:03.39]Why is that the case every time?
[71:05.95]It's like every single online video game launch.
[71:08.20]Just play in like four days.
[71:10.34]Just don't even play it.
[71:12.62]Come back in like a week and it'll be fine.
[71:19.07]I'm going to kick this guy's ass now.
[71:44.19]Out of my way.
[71:51.53]Come on.
[72:01.25]I know you're coming in for a move.
[72:04.05]So was I.
[72:16.63]Damn it!
[72:22.73]I'm not gonna get fucking stabbed in the back, please!
[72:28.08]Angry versus angry.
[72:37.36]This guy can do so much more damage than I can.
[72:39.64]He's just kicking the shit out of me.
[72:50.68]Alright, easy now, come on, don't lose this.
[73:11.86]Damn it!
[73:17.04]Oh, you fucking haymaker asshole!
[73:22.30]Get out of here!
[73:32.30]That was just like the... That was like the scrub, by the way.
[73:36.48]Oh, I unlocked the straight punch.
[73:38.76]Oh, coal.
[73:45.74]Fucking stupid fucking game.
[73:50.74]I got him.
[73:52.56]Don't worry, everybody's alright.
[73:53.68]That was just the first shitty boss of the game.
[74:01.39]No one is using a weapon, so why would I care?
[74:08.29]Heal and shield.
[74:12.24]Huh.
[74:17.10]Tar is demon down.
[74:21.78]We got the Taurus Demon.
[74:23.03]Alright, I'm gonna do... I want Endurance.
[74:25.37]I'm doing a point in Endurance.
[74:27.43]I need it.
[74:28.97]And then we got some Bare Hands.
[74:32.65]Alright, where's my new Bare Hands move?
[74:35.56]Avoid low attacks, okay.
[74:38.10]Use the Straight Punch.
[74:40.84]I didn't have this already.
[74:45.08]Less speed, but more power.
[74:48.99]Mmm, low kick.
[74:50.81]Oh, that's like strength.
[74:55.31]I'll go back to... Well, I'll go back there.
[74:56.83]I want to put it in, I think.
[74:57.87]Endurance?
[74:59.45]I had to.
[75:00.23]Come on.
[75:02.23]Come on.
[75:02.59]Alright, so this is... What's better?
[75:06.87]The kick or the straight punch?
[75:11.53]I mean, the straight punch is just better.
[75:13.61]It just is.
[75:14.43]Unfortunately.
[75:16.03]Unfortunately.
[75:18.79]Does more damage.
[75:25.61]Okay.
[75:26.25]Let's keep going.
[75:30.26]You chose a dexterity build.
[75:31.22]Why go for endurance?
[75:36.54]I don't know.
[75:37.74]To get some more stamina?
[75:41.19]To get a little bit more stam?
[75:43.67]I think.
[75:45.83]Did I do it wrong?
[75:52.26]Alright, who's left here?
[75:54.79]Uh, we got a guy in the corner.
[75:56.89]Two guys in the corner.
[75:57.85]I'm assuming that's this way.
[76:06.33]We got two more guys.
[76:07.49]Don't worry, just play.
[76:10.03]Yeah.
[76:11.15]But that's me, though.
[76:11.81]I'm like a worry wart.
[76:14.57]I get very worried.
[76:17.37]Lots of things.
[76:18.07]Wait, this is back up here.
[76:19.25]Bird Caller's Outpost.
[76:25.37]I guess this is the right way.
[76:26.77]So there's like a bird guy up here that I have to fight, apparently.
[76:31.10]Oh, and there's this bird friend.
[76:32.54]Alright, come on.
[76:43.72]Get out of town.
[76:46.25]Learning.
[76:47.27]Slowly learning.
[76:48.15]But, you know, we're learning.
[76:49.29]Okay.
[76:52.05]Watch out.
[77:02.72]Faked him out.
[77:03.98]Easy.
[77:06.14]Faked him out.
[77:06.66]That fucking game is stupid.
[77:13.16]Oh, shit.
[77:15.08]I've got to be careful.
[77:18.02]Oh, fuck 2v1.
[77:18.74]I don't like this.
[77:19.96]I gotta kill his friend immediately.
[77:21.80]Like, right now.
[77:22.64]Die.
[77:23.18]Get him.
[77:23.56]Quickly.
[77:24.96]Come on.
[77:25.32]I can't get... I can't... Stop getting kneed in the spine.
[77:35.18]Knock him off the cliff.
[77:36.83]Don't even give him a chance.
[77:45.76]I gotta focus on you.
[77:46.68]No, I gotta focus on you.
[77:47.89]Your friend's running.
[77:48.43]That's good for me.
[77:55.47]What?
[77:56.23]What?
[77:57.23]Holy shit, I'm trying to dodge these.
[78:05.28]Oh my god.
[78:05.94]You little piss face.
[78:08.64]This dumb fucking enemy.
[78:11.76]I'm going to give you a reminder of what this game is like.
[78:15.75]This game is like sticking knives into your chest.
[78:20.85]Why would I want to play it then?
[78:22.85]It's not like what it's like.
[78:24.87]It's not like what it's like at all.
[78:29.54]It's like For Honor.
[78:31.02]Maybe like For Honor, just the frustrating gameplay of trying to do the right thing and just losing.
[78:39.04]It's like a burning feeling in the middle of your chest.
[78:46.45]I don't like being on that side.
[78:47.75]The camera gets weird.
[78:49.31]It goes too far to the right.
[78:51.31]The characters are in the right part of the screen.
[78:52.93]I don't like it.
[79:03.19]Easy.
[79:04.79]Isn't that all fighting games?
[79:06.29]I guess you're right.
[79:06.85]That's true.
[79:15.97]Come here.
[79:16.37]Let me fucking Legend of Zelda you, please.
[79:21.86]What is that?
[79:22.22]What the fuck is that?
[79:25.36]Have I learned that yet?
[79:26.16]Have I learned how to... That's like the parry thing.
[79:28.06]That's the parry bullshit.
[79:30.75]Like, please, God, kill this guy.
[79:33.37]Or is he going to block every one of my moves?
[79:35.31]Is he going to fucking counter every move I do?
[79:38.79]Oh, man.
[79:40.05]Oh, man, I can feel the burning pain.
[79:42.18]It's like acid reflux.
[79:47.58]Yeah.
[79:49.86]Okay, are you playing Absolver, or did you just eat a bunch of fucking chili?
[79:53.30]You know what I mean?
[79:53.76]I don't know.
[79:54.20]I can't tell you.
[79:54.74]I don't know the difference.
[79:59.63]Oh, wait, I need to level up.
[80:06.91]I'm getting mad against bots.
[80:08.01]I'm not getting mad.
[80:09.57]I'm just trying to learn the controls in the game and it's frustrating.
[80:18.68]Channel your anger.
[80:22.38]You guys know what I'm talking about though, right?
[80:28.05]It's like in the shoulders.
[80:31.57]It's a shoulder thing.
[80:35.59]If I stop moving, does it heal faster?
[80:37.21]Probably not.
[80:40.45]Relax by playing Spore.
[80:42.83]The guy's definitely right up here, too.
[80:49.77]Yeah, I can hear the bird chirping.
[80:51.21]Here comes the bird guy.
[80:55.06]You know, I did eat chili right before this, so maybe I'm just explaining what it's like to eat chili.
[81:00.18]I think so.
[81:02.30]Yeah.
[81:06.55]I guess not.
[81:07.37]I guess we're just going this way.
[81:15.15]Apparently we're going up to the bird observatory now.
[81:18.45]I don't know what that is.
[81:19.19]There's like some blue goo over here.
[81:23.89]What is this?
[81:28.52]This is not like the main boss, right?
[81:32.76]Oh god, this is like the main boss, isn't it?
[81:40.42]This is like the main boss of the zone.
[81:48.35]I have to fight them both at the same time?
[81:56.62]What the hell?
[81:57.20]Where's my co-op partner?
[81:58.38]Can I throw them off the cliff?
[82:02.56]I can, right?
[82:03.06]Let me like toss her off the fucking edge.
[82:13.10]Gotta be smart about this.
[82:22.33]We're taking this up the stairs.
[82:25.25]Come up the stairs.
[82:28.49]That was a mistake.
[82:29.37]That was a mistake.
[82:42.49]Easy, easy, guy behind you.
[82:43.81]Easy.
[82:48.96]You both can't just sprint at me like that.
[82:50.44]Not fair.
[82:57.56]I hate that I have to fight you both at the same time.
[83:00.36]Where's my friend?
[83:09.90]Get out of here.
[83:10.44]Fuck you.
[83:15.78]Easy.
[83:16.14]Don't get cocky.
[83:18.00]It's not about cockiness.
[83:19.00]It's about being prepared.
[83:33.49]I'm going to watch.
[83:34.25]I'm going to dip him off.
[83:35.19]Dip him off.
[83:35.55]Dip.
[83:36.79]Dip.
[83:37.23]Come on down to get kicked.
[83:38.69]Good.
[83:38.81]They're both idiots.
[83:39.53]Perfect.
[83:41.59]No, you're not an idiot.
[83:43.24]Are you?
[83:48.05]Thankfully, you haven't attacked.
[83:50.21]I say that and I'm going to get fucking smoked in the corner here.
[83:52.73]Don't make them one behind you, one to the left of you.
[83:54.41]No way.
[83:54.75]Don't do that shit.
[84:07.57]Easy.
[84:15.36]Come on, you fucking asshole.
[84:23.15]Again.
[84:30.67]She's close.
[84:33.65]$50 joke, right?
[84:34.33]Hold on a second.
[84:37.99]Hold on.
[84:38.33]Somebody get $50.
[84:38.93]I gotta beat these two.
[84:40.07]This is like the major first boss of the game.
[84:46.67]That guy's fucking through.
[84:47.51]It's the haymakers, man.
[84:49.17]She's taking out a knife.
[84:56.60]You have to die now before you use that fucking knife on me.
[84:59.66]Kill her before she uses the sword.
[85:00.90]That's the game right there.
[85:06.61]And now he has a knife.
[85:08.31]Give me a blade.
[85:09.45]Did he pick that up?
[85:10.75]Did he pick up that sword?
[85:21.72]Money motivation.
[85:36.20]I gotta get the right stance here.
[85:53.72]Easy.
[85:56.16]What am I doing?
[86:50.09]Fucking wanker.
[86:58.27]I beat it.
[86:58.59]If I can heal.
[87:00.73]Last time I tried to heal.
[87:01.69]I got, like, I tried.
[87:03.69]I got fucking beat.
[87:08.09]Oh.
[87:10.07]That guy probably was, that guy, that was probably the easiest encounter of the whole game.
[87:16.06]But, you know, I'll take it.
[87:17.12]I'll take a victory.
[87:18.18]Why not?
[87:22.25]And do I go back in the blue or do I and servers back online yet?
[87:27.01]Now that's some good cider it is Level 2 unlock at combat trials level 20 That's a $50 victory.
[87:41.01]Alright.
[87:41.76]Hold on.
[87:42.16]Let me let me just briefly go over this That was the Bell Gargoyles
[87:50.55]Servers are up.
[87:51.49]Servers are up.
[87:52.29]Let's go.
[87:54.19]Zjug, thanks for the bits.
[87:55.83]They say PogChamp, thank you.
[87:57.41]Greed, thanks for the bits as well.
[87:59.53]Loading44, thanks for the two bucks.
[88:01.23]I would so buy a Glue Man t-shirt to support your next project.
[88:05.05]There is other merchandise that's coming.
[88:07.59]You guys are going to probably hate it.
[88:09.74]Because I hate it.
[88:10.94]But it's worth making.
[88:14.50]It's like one of those things where it's like a joke that I'm making it.
[88:18.91]But, you know, it's actually kind of practical.
[88:21.87]It is sort of practical.
[88:23.41]You'll see soon.
[88:26.49]Enzan gave the $50 a few minutes ago.
[88:28.79]$50 joke.
[88:32.35]It's not a fidget spinner.
[88:33.45]Oh my lord, I promise you that.
[88:36.47]But thank you, Enzan, for the $50.
[88:39.65]I don't have a $50 joke yet.
[88:42.23]Maybe in a few minutes.
[88:43.48]Maybe in like 10 minutes.
[88:45.60]But thank you nonetheless.
[88:47.87]Mental Ninja, thank you for the two bucks.
[88:49.79]You better be eating well, Jeremy.
[88:51.07]Don't be starving yourself by dropping all that stuff down the stairs.
[88:55.77]For a second, I was like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[88:59.33]But, yeah.
[88:59.99]I won't.
[89:01.94]I won't eat.
[89:02.86]No.
[89:03.28]I'll eat good.
[89:05.06]I eat, like, salmon, strawberries.
[89:08.82]I drink coffee.
[89:11.56]Not necessarily great for you, but it is.
[89:13.68]It's not bad for you.
[89:19.20]Forget about my saltiness.
[89:21.54]Everybody knows when I first play a new game, I hate myself for the first 30 minutes.
[89:26.20]It always happens.
[89:28.68]I get frustrated at myself, and then I take it out on the game.
[89:32.10]You know, I am going to take it out on the game, because where are the servers?
[89:39.41]I got some new stuff.
[89:42.05]Curved sword.
[89:45.69]I mean, I guess... Is this durability going to be...
[89:51.79]I don't know.
[89:52.15]I guess it's up.
[89:53.43]I can take it out or not take it out.
[89:54.91]Do I have it equipped?
[90:01.49]I think it's equipped.
[90:07.29]We're in a weird spot here.
[90:08.59]Why can I not take it out?
[90:22.37]Is it a shard?
[90:23.15]I mean, it looks like it's a... I don't know.
[90:33.08]I'm in a bad spot right now, though.
[90:34.94]I didn't hit either of these two fucking idiots.
[90:41.50]Alright, can we stop fighting on the slope?
[90:44.87]You ninja turtle wannabe.
[90:51.69]I'm gonna die here.
[90:52.51]I'm like so focused on the fucking weapon and like not fighting this guy and now I'm going to... I hate fighting two people.
[91:05.07]It's so irritating.
[91:07.23]I'm running the fuck away.
[91:09.46]How do I like just get off?
[91:19.32]I could have healed.
[91:20.24]I could have just... I don't even know.
[91:23.18]I died to like the easiest shit enemies in this game.
[91:26.38]Just because there were two of them at the same time.
[91:28.92]Because I don't have any friends.
[91:30.01]I don't have any friends because no servers exist for me.
[91:33.92]This game won't let me have any friends.
[91:36.16]It knows already.
[91:36.84]It's like, you don't have any fucking friends.
[91:40.05]Here, fight three people at the same time.
[91:42.77]Unlike every other person that's online right now, running around aimlessly, killing things together.
[91:47.53]You have to fight two people together at the same time.
[91:49.87]Offline mode.
[91:50.69]Fuck you, Jeremy.
[91:52.40]Now you made this guy cry.
[92:08.05]Get over here.
[92:13.43]Like, alright, so correct me if I'm wrong, but in the online mode, there's, like, potentially, like, 20 people running around right here, right?
[92:19.99]Like, fighting the same shit.
[92:28.96]Get... Just run the fuck away.
[92:30.62]This is so stupid.
[92:35.33]Did that guy just say no?
[92:37.78]Only three.
[92:38.48]Well, you're good.
[92:38.84]You killed your own friend.
[92:40.30]I would probably be doing the same thing if I had a buddy.
[92:41.86]I already have the heal going.
[92:50.78]Okay.
[92:52.43]Only 3,000.
[92:52.63]Come here.
[93:05.08]I need to block more so I can learn moves, right?
[93:12.77]I almost got that one learned.
[93:16.17]Do that again to me.
[93:17.37]I want to learn that one.
[93:21.47]Almost.
[93:24.66]That big, like, dashing kick, I almost haven't learned.
[93:28.46]Sword is up on the d-pad, but I guess I have to fill that bar before I can use it, right?
[93:35.43]This is an easy kill right here, right?
[93:40.63]This is such an easy kill.
[93:42.61]I have to knock you off.
[93:47.56]Just back it up.
[93:48.74]Back it up into the ditch.
[93:50.66]Just get into the well.
[93:55.66]Get in the well.
[93:56.58]Get in there.
[94:00.12]One of us is going in there and it ain't going to be me.
[94:02.18]It's going to be you.
[94:06.69]Okay.
[94:27.48]I got like stuck on the edge there.
[94:31.00]Okay.
[94:32.14]Alright.
[94:33.30]Get him out there.
[94:34.16]Come on, let's see it.
[94:36.49]Okay.
[94:37.82]Okay.
[94:39.66]I absolutely deserved that.
[94:41.10]Maybe I did.
[94:42.82]But I did get stuck.
[94:48.94]Time to chill and play stalker.
[94:51.83]Oh, chill and play stalker.
[94:52.95]No way.
[94:53.43]That's arguably even more intense than this.
[95:03.98]Absorb.
[95:04.76]Absorb.
[95:05.46]Absorb.
[95:09.23]Gain some more stamina.
[95:12.15]There was the $50 joke at my event.
[95:15.17]That's possible.
[95:24.70]Yeah, absorb that.
[95:32.90]Part of me kind of wishes that I... ...chose the, like, the absorb guy.
[95:40.30]Alright, this time, we're not gonna fuck around.
[95:42.20]You're going in immediately.
[95:52.26]Get in there.
[95:53.06]Get in there.
[95:53.44]Fucking get in there.
[95:54.44]Get in there!
[95:55.30]See?
[95:55.80]Well, no, not quite, but almost.
[95:57.29]Almost a C. Now I got a sword.
[96:01.07]Who's next?
[96:09.21]Whoa!
[96:09.77]This is... I like this move.
[96:11.73]This moveset's great.
[96:13.01]Ow!
[96:13.93]Ow!
[96:21.36]This moveset feels so much more fun.
[96:23.32]Why does it... Why does it feel like it's not as good?
[96:24.90]There it is.
[96:25.26]Alright, where are we going from here?
[96:32.82]We going online?
[96:36.71]I guess there are two people left.
[96:37.93]There's somebody around here that I have to get.
[96:43.92]Wow!
[96:44.72]Are we just going all into decks?
[96:46.10]No, we're going to do 12... 12-7.
[96:50.40]12-7.
[96:53.76]Get online.
[96:54.32]Alright, we're going to try online.
[96:56.40]It's saved right here, right?
[97:03.26]It just auto-saved.
[97:04.54]I'm going to try going online again.
[97:10.14]You don't know that Stalker is more intense?
[97:14.60]Alright, come on.
[97:15.08]Get me on there.
[97:16.78]Online.
[97:17.34]Let's do it.
[97:18.74]You're about to switch to online mode.
[97:20.35]Yes.
[97:21.41]Come on.
[97:22.23]There we go.
[97:23.25]Finally.
[97:25.93]Finally.
[97:27.77]Let's keep it going.
[97:28.61]Now we're online.
[97:36.62]So what does that mean?
[97:41.70]How do I play the game online?
[97:42.76]Is that a player?
[97:52.32]No.
[97:56.50]Look at all those players.
[98:06.74]You just get in the... I wasn't supposed to die right there.
[98:11.71]I was just... Alright, there's a guy right here.
[98:17.27]This is a good guy?
[98:18.29]Alright, so this is like my teammate.
[98:21.69]See what I'm talking about, guys?
[98:23.81]All it takes is literally... I get to play the game now.
[98:26.45]Now I'll fight two people at the same time.
[98:28.35]See what I mean?
[98:30.61]Now we get to each have our own person to fight.
[98:35.89]And there's no bullshit.
[98:36.77]No, it's fair.
[98:37.87]It's a fair fight.
[98:42.39]See?
[98:45.57]This is how the game was supposed to be played.
[98:47.85]See, I trip him, and then he punches him in the face.
[98:53.52]It's perfect.
[98:55.24]This is what I wanted.
[98:56.04]See, 3v2?
[98:57.12]We can do this.
[98:57.70]This is easy.
[98:58.26]Now, I gotta go help him.
[99:02.92]He's currently fighting...
[99:05.97]And there's another friend.
[99:06.87]Alright, good.
[99:07.21]We got two friends here now.
[99:12.98]Okay, the red bars are the good guys.
[99:15.04]I'm kind of getting a little confused.
[99:18.54]I haven't landed one punch.
[99:19.52]This is like, I'm... Alright, now, I swear to God, like, my brain is melted.
[99:30.13]Like, I'm just trying to process what's happening.
[99:34.83]Alright.
[99:38.46]Are we supposed... What?
[99:43.24]Wait, this is just open PvP?
[99:51.51]I'm so confused.
[99:52.69]Okay, I'm gonna follow this guy.
[100:02.07]I don't want to accidentally attack him though, because I don't want him to think I'm like a bad guy.
[100:04.91]Alright, nice punch.
[100:14.53]Oh, whoops, whoops.
[100:15.69]This is just, what does this remind me of?
[100:16.95]It's like when you accidentally hit somebody and it causes a huge problem.
[100:21.43]I'm just taking the loot.
[100:26.37]What, I can't take all the loot?
[100:28.17]It's not individual loot?
[100:31.58]We have to share loot?
[100:32.85]Easy, man, easy.
[100:35.01]Don't leave me with these fucking two.
[100:37.63]Come on, you gotta help.
[100:46.01]Nice, nice punches.
[100:47.85]Good co-op.
[100:50.79]This is the game I wanted to play.
[100:54.59]This is a fi- this is a good game.
[100:56.44]You know, you jab me a little bit there, but it's alright.
[101:02.22]Slide tackle.
[101:05.78]Oops.
[101:06.82]Oopsie.
[101:14.63]How can I... Can you see their health?
[101:19.25]I feel like I need to know.
[101:21.17]You acting hostile.
[101:23.17]What?
[101:25.77]I am.
[101:28.07]Am I acting hostile?
[101:29.11]I don't think I am.
[101:30.07]I just accidentally hit him.
[101:34.63]Oh, shit, man.
[101:35.35]Easy.
[101:35.61]This guy's, like, aggroing the whole fucking camp.
[101:49.88]I still, like, level up and everything, right?
[101:57.00]Why do I feel like this is so much more efficient way to get EXP?
[101:59.02]No, we don't want to go that way.
[102:07.63]What happened to the other guy?
[102:08.67]Wasn't there like, there's three people in here, right?
[102:17.88]Block, block, block, block, block.
[102:28.61]Come on.
[102:29.43]Get out of here.
[102:34.85]The third one marked.
[102:36.61]What?
[102:38.36]Wait, this is a boss.
[102:40.30]Why did he just aggro one of the bosses?
[102:42.56]I'm like just fucking practicing moves.
[102:44.66]And I'm like, why the fuck is this guy so good?
[102:46.22]I'm like just locked in the corner.
[102:51.84]Alright, he's dead.
[102:59.39]You take on the big guy.
[103:00.29]I'll deal with the little guys.
[103:01.13]You know what?
[103:04.07]Fuck this.
[103:06.45]I'm gonna use it, right?
[103:08.77]Or I'll just get hit in the fucking face a hundred times.
[103:10.85]Alright, let's double team her.
[103:27.45]Don't!
[103:28.17]Sorry.
[103:28.49]Ooh, easy!
[103:30.23]Oh god!
[103:30.87]Don't kill him!
[103:33.88]Oh shit, he's almost dead.
[103:36.35]How can I aggro?
[103:38.55]How can I aggro?
[103:41.17]I'm swinging a sword around, man.
[103:42.51]Go get your health.
[103:43.63]Go heal.
[103:46.23]I gotta put the sword away.
[103:46.95]This is dangerous.
[103:50.99]He's just like blocking.
[103:52.48]I'm so scared I'm actually gonna fucking kill him.
[103:54.96]Get out of the way.
[103:55.60]Let me finish him.
[103:56.88]Let me finish him.
[103:58.66]I'm sorry.
[103:59.04]I didn't mean to.
[104:01.90]How do I do that?
[104:02.56]How do I do that taunt?
[104:06.26]Frisk requested stop the fight.
[104:07.78]Frisk wants to stop the fight.
[104:15.31]I don't know what that means.
[104:20.79]Yeah, I guess we're done.
[104:25.27]We stopped it.
[104:28.14]This is cool.
[104:30.80]Should I have just gouged him?
[104:32.28]What do you guys think?
[104:35.35]in where me and fish are in neutral relation alright so it's like one of those situations we're not like seeing each other we're not like dating but we're like you know it's kind of complicated that's fine what is it will more shard refill wait what I can't l1 to answer I was hitting l1 l1 I was saying like hey
[105:15.41]Another person came in.
[105:18.74]You will play Spore.
[105:20.42]No, I won't.
[105:21.42]What?
[105:21.62]It's the same exact thing.
[105:25.10]What about this?
[105:27.02]I'll put that on.
[105:27.78]What about the new boots?
[105:32.70]I like these.
[105:39.77]L1, then red or green button?
[105:42.35]Well, I mean, I was... I was kind of looking over there.
[105:47.19]Oh, wait.
[105:47.79]Can me and Etalyx play this game?
[105:50.13]Just together?
[105:52.71]How does that work?
[105:53.21]I need to look at the map.
[105:59.10]I was supposed to hit the green button.
[106:02.30]That's the first time I've ever seen a person in the game.
[106:04.10]We've been playing for like an hour and 40 minutes where I don't have any... I'm not even in a school yet either.
[106:13.07]That was the first time I was able to play the game online.
[106:15.69]He told you to message him.
[106:18.75]What?
[106:18.91]Okay, I got something new.
[106:23.61]Exhaust.
[106:27.38]I like that.
[106:27.84]This is increased protection and reduced knockback.
[106:29.74]I want to try this.
[106:31.92]Heal is heal.
[106:36.78]Let me text Etalyx.
[106:39.08]And see what he's up to.
[106:42.78]He told me to do it when the servers are back on.
[106:47.18]Server is back.
[106:49.50]If you want to play.
[106:55.67]I betrayed him?
[106:56.67]No, we killed a boss together.
[106:58.03]Everything's fine.
[107:00.73]So this makes everybody consume more stamina.
[107:03.55]That's cool.
[107:05.15]Is that a Snapchat?
[107:10.41]Wait, it was social.
[107:12.58]I can't just, like, ping?
[107:14.10]Can I call that guy's cell phone?
[107:16.34]Encounters.
[107:20.06]Search for group by keyword.
[107:22.83]Players, recent encounters.
[107:24.27]See?
[107:24.83]There he is.
[107:26.97]I'm going to invite him.
[107:28.19]No.
[107:28.81]I'm not inviting him.
[107:32.97]Etalyx is going to be on in, like, 10 minutes, he said.
[107:38.31]Are you the only one that can't connect to servers?
[107:39.79]No.
[107:40.11]It is apparently an issue tonight.
[107:44.12]Two people came in.
[107:46.32]Two more friends.
[107:49.50]Which way?
[107:50.20]I wish it showed me what direction I was facing.
[107:53.11]So I could tell.
[107:53.69]There's one more guy here.
[107:56.41]I guess I could turn around and go backwards, like this way, I guess.
[108:00.93]I wonder if it's this way or that way.
[108:04.47]Let's just look up here first.
[108:10.05]I don't think it's this way, but whatever.
[108:13.37]Oh, I unlocked a new slot, too.
[108:14.43]I gotta go do that.
[108:20.57]New slot.
[108:25.27]An armband.
[108:26.25]Let me go do that.
[108:27.23]I'm safe right here, right?
[108:32.29]Practice.
[108:32.73]Alright, what was the new slot?
[108:34.89]Right here.
[108:37.25]So we got this little double-handed slap into...
[108:45.02]Just a kick.
[108:48.72]Hmm.
[108:53.81]Direct punch?
[108:55.47]Maybe I could just use it as like a one-two.
[108:59.47]No, I can only use it in one place.
[109:02.60]That's okay.
[109:03.18]That's just like a little double tap, right?
[109:08.26]Yeah.
[109:09.24]So I go 1, 2, 3, 4.
[109:10.90]That's kind of cool.
[109:14.84]So I can do 1, 2, 3, 4.
[109:18.02]Cool.
[109:20.72]What about this one?
[109:26.90]It's just a kick.
[109:28.52]This one does more... No.
[109:33.67]That's fine.
[109:34.65]Throw a kick in there.
[109:40.09]At least I can actually string things together now.
[109:44.76]If you don't make the stupidest sequence ever, why are you even playing?
[109:47.94]Well, I need to unlock the moves first, don't I?
[109:52.30]Just make it look like you're breakdancing?
[109:53.62]Oh, that's easy.
[109:54.00]I just have to do this.
[109:57.44]I just have to tap triangle.
[109:58.76]That's all I have to do.
[110:03.91]Use dodges more than blocks because you learn faster.
[110:06.05]Okay.
[110:07.73]Makes sense.
[110:14.06]Let's continue down here.
[110:18.34]My newfound talents.
[110:25.84]Oh, this is three fucking people at the same time.
[110:29.89]I just have to get them in the right spot.
[110:33.47]So then they'll all kick each other and punch each other in the face and shit.
[110:35.99]And then they can hurt each other.
[110:38.49]You guys have friendly fire on just like I do.
[110:41.55]You can hurt each other for all I care.
[110:44.98]Damn it.
[110:51.59]God damn.
[110:52.71]Like, like, honest to God.
[110:55.19]Are you just supposed to run away from this?
[110:56.73]How do you fight three people at the same time?
[111:12.67]I can't heal.
[111:13.11]I don't have enough thing.
[111:20.34]I'm just gonna slide into you.
[111:21.56]I'm gonna lose here.
[111:31.74]Eat the cheese?
[111:32.96]I got cheese?
[111:33.53]I need to just fight one of these guys at the same time.
[111:47.57]Okay, this is actually gonna work out.
[111:51.64]I can just sit here.
[111:54.16]This is what I get for not playing with fish.
[111:57.07]I know, right?
[112:01.25]Okay, now's the opportunity where I can just kind of slide in, right?
[112:07.23]We'll just get, like, full health again.
[112:13.68]Okay.
[112:23.44]Come on.
[112:25.25]Throw a punch.
[112:26.53]Do something.
[112:30.85]I'm just getting like stuck.
[112:31.95]Come on.
[112:35.65]Now I got the whole fucking crew over here.
[112:44.56]I have to get rid of him.
[112:45.98]That guy in the back will run away.
[112:47.42]These guys...
[112:54.02]Away from me.
[112:57.32]No, he's getting health back.
[113:01.31]Why do they have to all run so... That guy's hair changed.
[113:05.15]What?
[113:10.81]Are they changing hairstyles?
[113:19.54]Heel?
[113:20.60]I don't have access to my heel.
[113:29.64]I got new bracelets.
[113:31.90]It's kind of cool, I guess.
[113:40.28]I need to go back to that fucking obelisk.
[113:42.51]I don't even know where I'm going.
[113:49.37]I have absolutely no idea.
[113:53.49]Apparently, I'm in a different spot now, I guess.
[114:00.95]I was already up here.
[114:13.50]Can I grapple?
[114:14.32]No.
[114:16.24]Somebody's here.
[114:16.76]Here's another avatar.
[114:30.88]That map really is so bad.
[114:35.88]That map looks like what a map in like a fucking regular Nintendo game would look like.
[114:42.25]If I'm gonna be honest.
[114:54.13]What just happened?
[114:56.19]Did a giant like pterodactyl fly over me?
[114:57.99]What the hell was that?
[115:06.37]Where am I going?
[115:10.87]I guess I'm going this way.
[115:14.41]Wasn't I already here?
[115:19.87]Day and night cycle.
[115:21.04]Now it's just daytime.
[115:22.38]At least we got that.
[115:28.08]Yeah, this is like the very beginning of the game.
[115:32.82]Well, dissipate the gate.
[115:36.16]What?
[115:38.78]Dissipate the gate?
[115:42.68]Come on, I completed the portal puzzle.
[115:44.29]Let me in.
[115:49.43]Well, that took... What?
[115:53.95]I thought that wasn't going to let me in.
[115:54.98]Apparently, now it's letting me in.
[115:58.00]Where the hell am I?
[116:04.04]Where did I end up?
[116:04.68]Okay, now I'm in here.
[116:09.32]I guess I need to be in here.
[116:10.36]I need to fight one of these people.
[116:11.52]There's an NPC here.
[116:13.95]I built cairns around the city.
[116:16.45]Piles of stone with an open fold inside them.
[116:19.01]You will find items in that.
[116:20.69]It will help you on your journey.
[116:24.35]Okay.
[116:26.53]Yes, you do.
[116:27.05]So, now there is a... There's a guy that I need to fight over here.
[116:33.26]Where is he?
[116:34.48]What direction is he?
[116:35.46]I don't know.
[116:53.95]I don't think this is the right way.
[117:02.32]Now, give me a door or an arrow.
[117:06.66]It has to just be a blip.
[117:09.19]That guy looks like he's in this room, doesn't he?
[117:16.19]Doesn't it look like the guy's up here or around the corner?
[117:18.69]Like right here somewhere?
[117:22.20]Is this him right here?
[117:22.82]I mean, if I was a guy and that guy was a boss, I'd be this guy because I'm just sitting here in the middle of nowhere.
[117:31.56]Oh, it ain't him.
[117:32.68]That's somebody else.
[117:44.65]Come on.
[117:50.21]Mm-hmm.
[117:51.85]What else you got?
[117:53.93]What other moves can I steal from you?
[118:05.96]Oh, didn't learn that one.
[118:18.03]You're much harder than the other ones.
[118:19.17]Why?
[118:19.43]Okay.
[118:27.53]Well, that obviously wasn't a bad guy.
[118:31.10]Where are my friends?
[118:33.55]And why do I look like One Punch Man?
[118:41.41]Is my character balding?
[118:42.59]Yes, he is.
[118:44.25]It's a reflection on myself.
[118:45.45]Because I'm losing my hair.
[118:51.58]Not all at once.
[118:54.94]Just kind of.
[118:55.70]Slightly.
[118:56.12]A little bit.
[119:07.38]I guess we're going over here.
[119:11.06]Here comes that sun.
[119:15.40]Have I been this way yet?
[119:16.28]I don't think so.
[119:19.85]My hair looks fine.
[119:20.65]Don't sweat it.
[119:21.21]Well, sometimes you have to sweat it.
[119:28.68]Okay, well...
[119:33.94]Uh, that's, that's looking at, that's reading chat and walking forward.
[119:38.78]So.
[119:41.27]I'm talking, like, I'm chatting with you guys about my hair and I'm, like, walking on a bridge forward.
[119:44.89]Okay, that's fucking cool.
[119:48.83]Don't read and drive.
[119:50.70]Don't sweat it.
[119:51.84]Yeah, don't sweat it.
[119:55.90]Am I losing eyesight too?
[119:56.98]I'm reading the chat.
[119:58.32]I'm looking over and the game is broken.
[120:04.70]Why?
[120:05.74]Why?
[120:06.20]Let me back.
[120:08.50]I don't even know where I ended up either.
[120:22.95]Chat, like having a chat with you guys about me going bald.
[120:26.76]And I just walk into a fucking, into the ground.
[120:29.12]I'm gonna wait for somebody.
[120:30.26]Somebody just entered the arena.
[120:31.60]That means they're like right here, right?
[120:37.94]Where are they?
[120:41.61]Just follow the sun.
[120:49.63]Accept my baldness.
[120:54.05]I wanna find, like, the boss that's here.
[121:03.28]Like, I wish they just didn't make this shit as fucking stupidly vague as it is.
[121:08.58]Like, it's, okay, this is as effective...
[121:12.15]If you go to the Mall of America, and you go to the directory, you know like the gigantic fucking directory that just tells you where you're currently standing?
[121:21.28]That's what this is.
[121:21.76]This is a mall directory.
[121:23.82]There's no labels.
[121:28.80]This is just a you are here.
[121:30.88]Okay, that's great.
[121:31.80]I want to go to the fucking Macy's.
[121:34.00]Macy's is like over there.
[121:34.90]I don't know what direction that is.
[121:36.12]You're just telling me where I am.
[121:41.98]Better start fucking Rogaine now.
[121:54.07]That's not him.
[121:55.77]That's one of his creepy friends.
[121:57.41]I ain't getting collapsed on.
[122:03.07]I gotta move.
[122:06.50]Greg is my real name.
[122:07.54]Yes, it is.
[122:09.36]Gregory Arnold Elbertson.
[122:20.59]Ow.
[122:26.95]Too dark.
[122:27.65]Too dark.
[122:28.43]Can we go to a more well-lit room?
[122:30.53]Follow me over here.
[122:34.55]It's more lit over here.
[122:47.61]Gotta start updating the wiki.
[122:48.90]Mmm, watch out for the person behind me.
[122:58.34]Tripper, alright, finally, Jesus.
[123:19.69]Come on.
[123:20.03]Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing.
[123:24.68]Yeah, you have that move.
[123:25.46]Cool.
[123:26.10]I have other moves, too.
[123:26.90]You know, I can do, like, the windmill move, and I'm going to do it to you the second I dodge.
[123:29.54]I think I win.
[123:42.23]Fucking beat that guy so bad he like got sucked into the game.
[123:46.05]He got vacuumed into the ground.
[123:47.55]That guy got those fucking stunting on that guy so badly.
[124:01.68]What move is that?
[124:02.40]I just unlocked it.
[124:06.57]It's called clipping issue.
[124:08.69]It's a pretty good move.
[124:17.34]Like I can't hurt enemies anymore?
[124:20.52]What hap- Fucking kicked that guy's ass so bad, he used his Harry Potter cloaking device and took the fuck off.
[124:27.84]Pretty dangerous.
[124:30.03]Talking about the most dangerous man in the game.
[124:37.79]Everyone's so afraid of me now, I just have to look at them for a few minutes and then they go.
[124:41.86]They go away.
[124:48.26]How do I open this door?
[124:51.15]Why is it blind?
[124:52.31]Defeat them.
[124:52.83]Alright.
[124:56.01]That is what does that look like?
[124:57.41]Oh, man.
[124:58.05]Come on.
[124:58.49]What is it?
[124:59.31]Alright.
[124:59.63]OK, I got it.
[125:00.53]Alright.
[125:00.79]So you get up, get a typewriter and start typing with a typewriter, write a sentence with a typewriter and then go back like and write on the same line.
[125:10.19]That's what that is.
[125:11.54]You're just doing the same line typewriter.
[125:18.80]Did they code this game with a typewriter?
[125:21.24]What the fuck?
[125:24.00]Etalyx!
[125:26.12]Etalyx!
[125:27.14]Where are you?
[125:27.77]I got some pants.
[125:30.35]Alright, so this is like Groundhog Day.
[125:36.73]Can I, like, not die?
[125:39.69]I don't know.
[125:41.55]I'm not sure I want to find out.
[125:43.33]Okay, that hurt a lot, so I can die.
[125:45.70]I can die in my own universe.
[125:48.34]But other people in my universe can't.
[125:49.72]Who the fuck are you?
[125:50.32]Okay.
[125:53.82]The marked gate is down this path and knows your deeds and cannot be cheated.
[125:57.21]Find your marks and defeat them otherwise the gate will remain shut.
[126:02.51]That's good to know.
[126:05.55]But I don't think I can fight anybody anymore.
[126:19.51]Alright, am I Scooby-Dooing myself right now?
[126:22.37]I just left this room and came back in it.
[126:28.33]I did.
[126:28.59]I just Scooby-Dooed myself.
[126:37.80]There's too many, like, convoluted exits.
[126:43.84]I just want to fight the guy.
[126:44.86]I just want to fight the guy that's here somewhere.
[126:47.34]Where is he?
[126:49.20]No, he's not by the gate.
[126:50.85]He's not over here.
[126:52.71]I just want to get out of here.
[126:55.39]This is that fucking painting.
[126:57.07]The painting with the staircases that all lead into each other and go upside down and shit.
[127:00.39]I can't get out of here.
[127:04.40]What is that painting?
[127:05.16]It's like a Michelangelo painting.
[127:07.84]You know what I'm talking about?
[127:10.48]All of these things lead to nothing.
[127:12.24]They keep going upside down.
[127:13.24]It's like Leonardo da Vinci drew it.
[127:22.88]Get me out of here.
[127:24.04]Help!
[127:24.98]Etalyx, help!
[127:27.08]Oh shit, I'm gonna die!
[127:33.42]Mick... Mick Isher.
[127:36.94]What is that?
[127:37.34]Is that like a... What is that?
[127:39.33]What is that?
[127:39.61]Like a new McDonald's fucking menu item?
[127:41.69]Like Mick Isher?
[127:44.19]Where am I?
[127:46.61]I'm still in the same fucking spot.
[127:48.79]How is that possible?
[127:52.37]I got Mick Eichert.
[127:59.25]These pants don't do anything different.
[128:11.12]There's a... I'm going this way.
[128:13.70]Alright, at least we found a bad guy.
[128:18.48]And now I can actually fight.
[128:19.70]We're good.
[128:22.95]We got out of the Gaiser painting.
[128:26.83]Things are back to normal.
[128:28.39]I broke that guy's back.
[128:32.09]Yeah, once you leave the fucking painting, like in Super Mario, things just go back to normal.
[128:36.80]Like the castle.
[128:37.40]Remember the castle in Mario?
[128:38.50]Remember how normal that was when you weren't in one of the paintings?
[128:45.92]Besides, forget about Toad being in the wall.
[128:54.64]Forget about the MacGyver painting.
[128:55.90]MacGyver was a shitty show, and he made a shitty painting.
[128:58.74]Who cares?
[128:59.18]I feel like I'm just backtracking at this point.
[129:08.11]I'm not sure where I am or where I'm supposed to be going.
[129:18.00]Do something.
[129:20.76]I know you've heard the fucking tales about me, but you couldn't do anything.
[129:34.69]No, something happened, you know, because people are idiots now.
[129:37.79]These enemies are idiots.
[129:38.87]They're not, like, they're just dodging.
[129:41.77]They're not doing anything worth... And I keep breaking their backs.
[129:50.03]I didn't go through the glowy door.
[129:50.99]I can't go through the glowy door yet.
[129:53.11]Apparently I can't.
[129:58.62]And where are the other players?
[130:00.18]What happened?
[130:02.09]Do I not have any more people that are going to come in my game?
[130:03.97]I want to fight this guy, not... Oh, my lord.
[130:14.55]Alright, easy.
[130:24.26]Easy, easy.
[130:25.38]I picked up some stuff.
[130:35.27]Maybe this game is just lame?
[130:38.42]No, dude, there are like 15,000 people playing.
[130:40.94]Were you guys lying to me when you said that?
[130:44.56]Is this safe?
[130:45.52]Can I- can I- What the fuck?
[130:47.64]Hold on a minute.
[130:48.26]Wait a minute.
[130:48.68]Wait a minute.
[130:49.52]What?
[130:49.80]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[130:53.29]There was- there was no stuff here.
[130:55.19]There was nothing here.
[130:56.95]I thought it was like a- Wait, I might be able to salvage this.
[131:04.12]Can I?
[131:19.99]Are there any enemies down here?
[131:23.09]Any PvP down here?
[131:25.21]Any friends to play with down here?
[131:26.75]How about down here?
[131:44.86]Found the secret.
[131:45.46]What if like there was like 15 people down there all fighting?
[131:53.88]The sewer level.
[131:58.92]How did I manage to break this game so quickly?
[132:00.72]You've been playing for eight hours and have never seen any of these problems.
[132:03.74]I'm telling you guys, if I touch something, it like... Anything electronic or like... I don't know what it is.
[132:14.18]How did I get under storm wind?
[132:17.87]Play offline?
[132:18.79]Oh, but I want to play online.
[132:20.13]That's too bad.
[132:20.95]Unfortunate.
[132:21.49]Yeah.
[132:23.28]I think we're at a black screen though.
[132:31.32]Uh, we might have, alright, we're going to have to, we're going to have to get it, get it.
[132:34.87]I'm going to like, I'm going to like try to get in touch with the talics.
[132:37.93]Are the servers actually offline?
[132:40.45]Oh God.
[132:41.99]Jesus.
[132:42.71]What the fuck?
[132:46.07]Alright.
[132:46.29]Give me a second.
[132:46.97]I'm going to, I'm going to go take a break.
[132:48.31]I'm going to grab a drink.
[132:48.95]I'm going to go grab a drink.
[132:50.63]I'll be back.
[132:51.71]Give me like two, three minutes.
[135:05.30]Thank you.
[135:36.11]Yeah.
[136:11.82]This is bird noises.
[136:14.66]Oh, I didn't close Absolver.
[136:16.01]Okay.
[136:17.45]I come back and I hear like a bunch of like fucking like birds and monkeys like.
[136:25.11]Dave, listen.
[136:26.93]I thought that was like outside.
[136:27.97]Alright, let's get Etalyx in here so he can explain to us what's going on with this video game.
[136:34.35]See if we can pull him in.
[136:41.16]Okay, Etalyx.
[136:44.40]Here it is.
[136:44.90]Give it a second.
[136:46.00]I've got to load in.
[136:48.68]And there he is.
[136:52.26]And there he is.
[136:55.51]Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... Hey, hold on.
[136:58.71]What the... You blew your intro.
[137:03.53]Ladies and... I can hear you now.
[137:05.15]Oh, sorry.
[137:05.67]Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you... It's that guy.
[137:08.39]Etalyx.
[137:09.15]Etalyx.
[137:12.62]So, uh... You really do sound like a soundboard.
[137:17.23]Like, you are a soundboard.
[137:20.67]Okay, so, wait, you got good news and bad news?
[137:24.61]The good news is I'm here.
[137:25.95]There we are, okay.
[137:26.89]The bad news is this game doesn't work.
[137:29.70]Wait, what do you mean the game doesn't work?
[137:32.34]I mean, like, are you playing online?
[137:34.96]Are you playing with other people?
[137:36.92]You know, I was until very recently.
[137:41.08]Because as far as I can tell, my fears have come true.
[137:46.73]And it turns out small indie developer struggles in permanently online multiplayer game.
[137:53.21]Okay, so what happened?
[137:55.65]Because I just got sucked into the void.
[137:58.32]The game died on me.
[138:00.66]So where are you?
[138:02.32]I'm currently force quitting the game.
[138:04.42]Oh.
[138:05.86]Then what probably happened is if you died...
[138:09.18]then when you start the game back up you'll probably be like not in the void and you'll be able to play as normal but unfortunately it's not online you won't be able to play with me unless uh something changes okay but the game is a lot more fun with more than one players yeah it got there it got it got like really interesting and then they like took it away from me and I like fell down a hole so tell me about your experience so far
[138:37.91]Well, my experience so far has been great.
[138:44.82]I can tell.
[138:46.20]My experience has been... Look, it's a cool game.
[138:50.10]Cool idea.
[138:51.86]There's a but.
[138:53.30]No but yet.
[138:55.94]No but.
[138:56.36]Not yet.
[138:57.68]But, I mean... No but.
[139:02.38]Offline mode, yes.
[139:03.70]Okay, well, whatever.
[139:05.18]You want to sit here and help me play the game?
[139:08.73]I want to like play multiplayer.
[139:10.59]I would love to play multiplayer with you.
[139:12.93]Let's just continue.
[139:13.54]Let me see where I am.
[139:14.38]How did you get online before?
[139:15.76]Because it just worked.
[139:17.46]Like it was offline for the first hour I played.
[139:19.38]It was offline.
[139:20.88]And then.
[139:21.62]Alright.
[139:21.84]So this is where I was before this part.
[139:24.46]There was like a Minecraft chunk error.
[139:26.24]This didn't exist before.
[139:29.14]The question, when you got online, did you have to quit to main menu, then connect?
[139:34.93]Yes.
[139:35.13]Or were you just playing the game and then all of a sudden you were online?
[139:39.58]Yeah, it was all of a sudden.
[139:40.84]People showed up.
[139:42.84]No, no, I had to actually do it.
[139:44.54]I had to actually quit and then go online.
[139:49.63]And what's going on with my frames?
[139:56.15]Oh, by the way, like, can you, like, help me decipher this fucking mall kiosk map?
[140:03.40]Uh, the map sucks.
[140:04.94]Right.
[140:05.82]It's pretty much just not a map.
[140:07.40]It's pretty much just how many bosses you have left to fight.
[140:10.45]Yeah, I know, but is there any indication of direction, or is it just you are here?
[140:15.69]There's not an indication really of direction, but if you keep going in a certain direction, it feels more open than it actually is in the sense that you will just go in a big circle eventually.
[140:27.54]Okay.
[140:31.04]I guess I understand.
[140:31.88]What have you done so far?
[140:35.63]I beat the first, like, major boss.
[140:38.21]The two people.
[140:40.03]The guy and the girl that, like, you get the cutscene and the guy jumps down.
[140:42.45]That was actually the last boss that I fought.
[140:45.67]Wait, that was the last boss?
[140:47.41]Yes, that was the... There's not, like, a set last boss, necessarily.
[140:52.54]I went the other direction and came to that one last.
[140:55.84]Okay.
[140:58.06]So if that helps you at all, find your way.
[141:00.26]I mean, not really.
[141:01.36]I'm just kind of, like, walking around.
[141:03.96]So you have no idea where you are, or?
[141:07.60]My frames died.
[141:09.20]I was playing like a perfectly smooth like 60 plus FPS.
[141:11.39]Need ammo.
[141:13.23]Yeah, need ammo.
[141:19.31]I gotta figure out why my frames died.
[141:20.53]Because this wasn't happening before.
[141:24.88]No, you gotta go, help me!
[141:27.16]Help me?
[141:28.46]Help me!
[141:29.78]Help me.
[141:31.18]Have I gone over here?
[141:32.81]out of mana stop now you're actually I'm like getting confused you're confusing my fucking small brain I just I just dove into a ball kick by the way so is there something else that we can do like I feel like this is not fun unless like we can do this together uh I mean there is something else we can do it's just you are not going to do it I'm not going to do it because well you you kind of can't do it because it would take too long to install what is that
[142:04.56]Do you really want me to tell you?
[142:06.66]I mean, sure.
[142:08.16]What's the other thing you want me to do?
[142:09.96]Not that I want you to do.
[142:11.20]Just something you can do.
[142:12.56]Okay.
[142:15.46]Destiny 2.
[142:16.55]Open beta.
[142:17.23]Absolutely not.
[142:21.55]Absolutely not.
[142:24.43]What's going on with my fucking FPS here?
[142:26.85]Hold on.
[142:32.08]Everything was fine until about 12 seconds ago.
[142:42.76]That house has a boss in it.
[142:44.52]Holy shit, it does.
[142:45.30]Well, I already beat this boss.
[142:47.32]I already beat this one.
[142:48.04]Remember me and that guy Fish?
[142:49.20]Me and my friend?
[142:49.92]The only friend I had the whole game?
[142:51.06]I already beat this guy.
[142:54.64]Why would I need to do this again?
[142:55.56]Take out the fucking sword and start slicing.
[143:03.43]I'm gonna lose.
[143:04.91]I did that as a joke.
[143:07.45]Why do I have to fight this guy again?
[143:10.83]I don't even know the moves for this.
[143:11.81]I don't even know why I did this.
[143:12.81]I gotta put this away.
[143:13.35]What a stupid idea.
[143:14.09]I'm hoping if I just run around long enough, it'll randomly connect me.
[143:23.80]The flow has been taken off so hard with this game for me.
[143:27.12]Just because of the lack of online?
[143:29.24]I just keep leaving and exiting.
[143:30.96]I already beat this boss.
[143:33.44]And it's making me fight this boss again.
[143:35.28]Well, I mean, about like 50% of the game is supposed to be you interacting with other people.
[143:40.98]Right.
[143:41.41]So, like, I've been playing this game solo the entire time, essentially.
[143:45.79]Yeah.
[143:47.41]That's kind of like half the game.
[143:48.67]So explain to me why I have to fight this boss again when the boss died on my screen like fucking 40 minutes ago.
[143:54.21]You don't have to defeat any boss.
[143:56.54]Why is this person still here?
[143:58.86]Because it's kind of like you can fight them again.
[144:04.61]That's got like a drink made for me.
[144:06.39]Like that's more important right now.
[144:07.72]I'm just gonna start like slamming this.
[144:09.16]Oh my god!
[144:10.04]Do you like it or is it?
[144:16.92]That's what I'm talking about.
[144:18.76]It's good.
[144:20.10]Okay.
[144:20.86]Thanks.
[144:21.67]Thank you.
[144:22.87]Thank you for the delicious drink.
[144:24.37]Bye guys.
[144:25.01]Bye.
[144:26.45]Bye Kim.
[144:27.55]That was Kimberly.
[144:31.55]Look, I went upstairs and I was like, you're going to have to make me a strong drink for this one.
[144:38.02]She's like, what's wrong?
[144:38.72]I'm like, this game fucking sucks.
[144:42.20]The game doesn't suck though.
[144:43.34]The one problem that I have is like, so if this entire game's fun factor comes from playing and interacting with other players, I'm just kind of punching a wall right now.
[144:57.38]I mean, like, I would say I played about half of what I played solo, but the other half that I randomly ran into other players and we, like, agreed to help each other, that was way more fun.
[145:08.29]Well, that was... Uh... Alright, well, if we can't play the game the way the game's supposed to be played, then I... We need to move... I gotta move on to something else.
[145:19.21]Because, look, I've had fun for a couple hours, like, playing solo and, like, the interactions are fun.
[145:23.09]I don't know, man.
[145:26.88]I'm kind of just like going through the motions right now because I'm like not interested anymore.
[145:32.70]It was interesting for a while and then we like the game broke and now like I kind of don't care.
[145:37.92]I did care.
[145:42.17]I'll play the World War 2 beta.
[145:43.43]No way.
[145:48.17]Alright, Alex.
[145:48.81]What game are we... You know, I don't even care what it is at this point.
[145:52.04]How can we like interact like fucking 60,000 people in chat?
[145:56.72]How can we interact with 60,000 people in chat?
[145:59.92]You want to play like a dumb like Jackbox game?
[146:05.12]I never thought I would see the day.
[146:07.98]What else is there to do?
[146:09.67]My PlayStation 3, I've got like 60 games with PS3 sitting behind me.
[146:13.39]What's a game that every person in chat could play?
[146:16.55]I don't know.
[146:19.47]Roblox.
[146:20.03]I'm not going to play Roblox.
[146:22.62]Roblox.
[146:24.46]That's a great one.
[146:27.25]I mean, I'm sure that game's like fun.
[146:29.83]It's like Minecraft, but it's not Minecraft, right?
[146:34.95]I think I played Roblox once.
[146:38.72]Like four years ago.
[146:44.93]This is kind of disappointing.
[146:46.25]Because my backup here is my PlayStation 3, and I have a lot of stuff to play for that.
[146:51.52]But I have to, like, turn off the stream to set that up, unfortunately.
[146:55.06]Like, it's not going to happen.
[146:57.50]Um... I kind of thought that they were going to have server problems today.
[147:02.35]Yeah, but I mean, didn't this game come out at, like, noon?
[147:04.73]I'm sad that it turned out to be true.
[147:06.55]Didn't this game come out, like, a fucking long time?
[147:09.01]Like, the game didn't just, like, launch, like, 20 minutes ago.
[147:11.19]The game came out, like, fucking 10 hours ago.
[147:17.26]obviously that's not like any you know you can have server problems all the time but it's uh not not to rub salt in its wound it's not even a top seller well whatever I mean like there's there can't be like the tens of thousands of people trying to all get in well it's good doesn't have like 1100 reviews on steam hold on wait wait wait wait doesn't this game have like 50 000 concurrent players right now does it
[147:44.83]Let me look at Steam stats.
[147:46.03]There's like 15,000 people playing right now.
[147:49.11]Was that a lie?
[147:49.83]Were people just fucking with me?
[147:51.71]Currently, the peak today is 19,000 players.
[147:56.00]Right?
[147:56.24]So what's going on here?
[147:57.56]There's currently 11,400.
[148:00.46]I could play Stalker.
[148:01.28]That's true.
[148:03.10]I could just go back to Stalker for a little while.
[148:07.55]Yeah.
[148:07.87]Yeah.
[148:09.51]Yeah.
[148:13.61]I've been wanting to play that game again for a little while.
[148:15.19]We'll play that game for like a couple hours or something like an hour or two.
[148:17.31]Let's go back to Stalker.
[148:19.83]Sorry, sorry, um, Absolver.
[148:23.57]You could have been like kind of fun.
[148:25.05]You were kind of fun.
[148:27.80]But you require for the utmost entertainment to be on the internet.
[148:33.34]Yeah.
[148:35.01]I would say that that's the way the game is meant to be played.
[148:37.57]Yeah.
[148:38.91]For sure.
[148:40.17]Do Man vs. Wild?
[148:40.99]We already did Man vs. Wild.
[148:42.99]Why would you ever request Man vs. Wild?
[148:46.11]That game was awful.
[148:49.09]Alright, give me a second.
[148:50.79]Let's get out of here and I'll put up Stalker again.
[148:55.00]Play that for like an hour or so.
[148:56.34]Apparently I was about to get to a really interesting part of the game, so give me one second.
[148:59.46]Etalyx, tell people a joke.
[149:01.82]I'll be right back.
[149:04.45]It's not like I'm leaving, but I'm just turning this up.
[149:06.45]Oh, you should have seen the wacky shit that was happening before the game, like, went down.
[149:15.54]I, like, went through, I went through, like, the Earth.
[149:18.08]I was, like, hitting people and they were flying through the fucking, they were, like, no clipping through the ground.
[149:23.42]I got to see, like, the map from far away.
[149:27.02]Didn't make very much sense.
