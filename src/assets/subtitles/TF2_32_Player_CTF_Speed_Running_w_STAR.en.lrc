[00:08.39]Crits, what do you want?
[00:09.95]Uber.
[00:10.19]You're gonna need an old-fashioned Uber charge for this one.
[00:14.19]Where are you?
[00:15.93]As soon as you start healing me and we leave the door, we got 10 minutes to do this.
[00:20.06]Alright, wait, so the second I start healing you, we have 10 minutes?
[00:23.80]Yes.
[00:24.52]Start like the split.
[00:25.30]10 minutes.
[00:25.58]We're not gonna make it across the field here.
[00:33.74]We're on a red team.
[00:34.54]Don't get backstabbed.
[00:35.84]I won't, I won't.
[00:36.88]I think that, that, no, that's a real... Wow, we're actually making some progress here.
[00:39.66]We're gonna go up into the vents and, uh, see if we can get in here.
[00:43.01]Oh my god!
[00:45.69]I think there were 32 people in there.
[00:47.31]This heavy's gonna burn.
[00:49.75]Hold on.
[00:50.53]Hold on, be careful.
[00:51.21]Okay, I'm in.
[00:51.83]No, no, forget everyone else.
[00:53.25]I, I'm gonna die.
[00:54.33]I love your name.
[00:59.04]CTF Shalaj.
[01:01.52]Let's go.
[01:03.22]This Heavy is so pissed.
[01:04.82]Okay, the Heavy's going first.
[01:06.95]He is so pissed at me, too.
[01:08.31]He's, like, spamming E. I feel, like, bad.
[01:10.23]I almost got an Uber.
[01:12.37]Don't die yet.
[01:12.91]Okay, we're just gonna wait for someone to come this corner, because they're going to.
[01:17.44]Time check.
[01:19.24]I don't have the time.
[01:20.14]I don't actually have a timer right now.
[01:21.80]I thought you were, like, you said you were, like, running splits.
[01:24.38]I'll edit it in after.
[01:25.88]Oh, my God.
[01:27.20]Oh, God.
[01:27.82]Tell me when you want it.
[01:30.15]Oh, we have it.
[01:30.77]Let's go.
[01:31.25]Go, go.
[01:41.86]How are you and how do you do this?
[01:44.30]How do you do you don't you don't okay?
[01:46.86]We've got them like locked in There's like 12 people up here.
[01:52.37]I don't have ammo.
[01:53.35]I don't have enough ammo We're gonna get watch out for this crit pile this crit pile is gonna kill everybody Back in the vent
[02:04.52]I'm an event this is tense they're gonna fall they're gonna follow us back here no no no it's it's fine it's fine I'll lay a lay some stickies oh you know there's got to be a century down here we need to just build uber and then go down and we can get this okay so I'm gonna lay like a hundred stickies here a hundred you mean you mean eight it's five shut up one two three four
[02:28.81]Four or five.
[02:29.57]Be able to do Uber!
[02:30.61]When is Valve gonna fix, like, the fucking Medi-Beam bug?
[02:34.79]My Medi-Beam is going, like, into the wall.
[02:36.51]I can't even tell if I'm healing you or not.
[02:40.12]Um... Well... Deal with it.
[02:43.12]Um, I got you.
[02:44.28]Look, now it looks like I'm healing you.
[02:45.94]I just have to, like, move it in a weird direction.
[02:47.38]Okay, okay.
[02:50.42]Where are we going?
[02:51.12]Are we going down?
[02:51.66]We're going straight down.
[02:53.62]There's definitely a sentry here.
[02:54.92]Alright, you ready?
[02:55.69]Go, go, go.
[03:00.36]mess of a room.
[03:01.27]I can't.
[03:03.81]We're so dead.
[03:04.83]We're so dead.
[03:06.23]Get it.
[03:08.21]There's no way.
[03:09.60]There's no way.
[03:10.44]Look how many people there are.
[03:18.03]And at that moment, I think the reality dawned on me that, no, this isn't possible.
[03:21.83]I thought, okay, no, maybe with this Uber, we've got Uber, we could do this.
[03:26.00]Let's go.
[03:26.50]Two eggs scrambled.
[03:27.42]At least we're on the red team, who's, like, the one who's up there.
[03:31.39]I really don't know if this is... Someone has it.
[03:34.31]There's a medic running back with it.
[03:37.89]What a champion!
[03:40.07]I have to make sure I get these.
[03:43.56]Mountain Dew Boy.
[03:47.60]Well, I mean, I did destroy every sentry, so I'm going to take a little bit of credit.
[03:51.40]All right, well, let's get the third one.
[03:54.32]We only got to get one more.
[03:55.28]Oh, we got crits.
[03:58.79]We got crits.
[04:01.40]Don't die.
[04:02.84]Don't die, challenge.
[04:06.22]Anything in there?
[04:06.72]Anything in there?
[04:07.44]Can we clean this up now?
[04:09.58]Oh, there's a sentry.
[04:11.60]I'm dead.
[04:12.74]I'm not.
[04:13.12]I'm not.
[04:13.46]I'm not.
[04:13.90]I can do this.
[04:14.98]No!
[04:16.46]Would you get huntsmaned?
[04:17.81]Yes.
[04:18.87]Why didn't you shoot the heavy that was right there?
[04:20.71]I would've.
[04:22.53]I would've, but I'm playing midi.
[04:23.79]Dude, I don't want to get outplayed by Mountain Dewboy right now.
[04:27.05]Dude, Mountain Dewboy, seriously, like, is the reason why we're gonna win this.
[04:32.06]Okay, I'm here.
[04:33.32]Behind you.
[04:34.56]Scout's getting in and getting it.
[04:36.62]That's it.
[04:37.16]We're gonna win.
[04:38.77]Is it three?
[04:39.19]Yeah, it's playing to three.
[04:40.87]Yeah, we got this.
[04:41.73]Has it been ten minutes?
[04:44.21]Did we do our initial challenge?
[04:46.69]It's gotta have been like five minutes.
[04:48.75]That's my estimation.
[04:52.44]Well, we did come in here and there was one tapped.
[04:53.70]We didn't actually get it.
[04:56.22]No, we didn't actually do anything.
[04:57.28]I don't feel satisfactory about this.
[04:59.52]That's not even a word.
[05:00.62]Sorry.
[05:00.92]No, he hasn't actually gotten the thing.
[05:03.36]Did he get killed?
[05:03.76]We gotta go back and get it.
[05:05.82]I'm bumping into a spy.
[05:06.78]I don't know where the hell he is.
[05:09.99]We gotta come back to the mid.
[05:11.35]Yep.
[05:13.79]Watch out.
[05:14.49]Watch out.
[05:15.27]Watch out.
[05:15.75]He's going for me.
[05:16.81]He's going for me.
[05:17.43]He's trying.
[05:17.99]He's trying his hot.
[05:18.80]He's trying his hot.
[05:20.46]Jeez.
[05:21.66]I'm so screwed.
[05:26.15]I think Mountain Dewboy has it, if I'm going to be completely honest with you.
[05:30.10]I think Mountain Dewboy is about to capture this.
[05:31.98]Yes, he is.
[05:32.52]Mountain Dewboy just won it.
[05:35.78]How could one person be that good?
[05:38.43]And he's a medic.
[05:40.39]Like, why is no one shooting him?
[05:43.31]Mountain Dewboy, that's your answer.
[05:52.15]Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
[05:54.61]What the fuck?
[05:55.87]I feel like that's not going in the video.
[06:09.08]Watch out, we better- never mind, he's dead.
[06:11.16]He instantly exploded.
[06:13.04]Because of the two... centuries that- like, what are they- what are these doing here?
[06:19.01]There's two door sentries.
[06:21.39]Have you ever seen a sentry- a door sentry before?
[06:23.71]Like, work?
[06:24.19]A door- oh, oh my god.
[06:26.67]There are door sentries here.
[06:28.01]Yeah.
[06:28.37]Can they even reach the corner?
[06:29.82]I don't know.
[06:30.98]Well, they just killed somebody.
[06:37.70]Why is this working?
[06:39.12]There's so many enemies!
[06:39.72]There's laser beams coming right out.
[06:41.60]Why is this- why is this strategy working?
[06:43.93]This should not be working.
[06:47.17]And look, you can see through here, there's another heavy with the brass beast just revved up forever.
[06:52.73]Oh, yeah.
[06:54.11]Come on, move up that door sentry.
[06:55.81]We need that hallway sentry pointing down this hallway.
[06:58.89]Yeah, I know.
[06:59.43]We're creeping it.
[07:00.03]This is called the slow push.
[07:05.73]I'm barely aiming, too.
[07:08.39]If I shoot in this hallway, something is going to die.
[07:12.09]There's, I think, four heavies.
[07:13.61]I think all 16 people are standing in this hall.
[07:15.99]Back up, back up.
[07:18.68]I know, no one's going the other way.
[07:19.76]Maybe we should do a rotate, do a flanking maneuver.
[07:22.02]A rotate.
[07:25.81]I'm feeling confident about the flanking maneuver.
[07:28.05]Well, I got 72%.
[07:29.23]This guy's trying to, like, cheeseball this century.
[07:39.13]Do these heavies, like, not... Okay, let's go the other way, other way.
[07:44.50]There are too many, there are so many people in that hall.
[07:47.08]It's like disgusting how many people are in there.
[07:51.38]Again, you're gonna have, you'll have double uber again.
[07:54.26]Use it.
[07:55.26]God, I died right when you said it.
[07:57.75]You're so good.
[07:58.77]You're so good.
[08:00.25]It just spammed down that hallway.
[08:02.57]Sorry, I can only handle so many fucking grenades coming down a fucking hallway.
[08:08.09]Jeremy's mad about it too.
[08:11.29]Free backstabs.
[08:12.45]Are you still alive?
[08:13.55]Are you still alive?
[08:14.51]I'm at the hallway where the endless fight is happening.
[08:17.55]You're at the endless hallway.
[08:18.65]Okay.
[08:19.33]And I'm ubered, apparently.
[08:20.59]So you're at the hallway in Mario 64 where, like, you go up the stairs.
[08:25.04]But, like, the stairs never end.
[08:27.04]I never played that game.
[08:28.00]Top comment.
[08:28.80]Star never what?
[08:30.18]What?
[08:30.76]Wow.
[08:31.44]Star never played Mario 64?
[08:33.78]What a... What a... Yes.
[08:39.16]Yes.
[08:40.52]Yes.
[08:42.95]Yes!
[08:46.73]We could really have like five Ubers coming through here.
[08:48.91]I don't even... There's still the sentries.
[08:51.73]There's still the sentries to deal with.
[08:53.79]How many are there?
[08:55.45]Maybe just two?
[08:57.26]We have two or three medics in this hallway.
[08:58.74]I think we might get it here.
[09:01.32]Heavy to the right.
[09:01.80]Overheal me.
[09:02.14]I don't know where you are.
[09:03.30]Is Heavy dead?
[09:08.48]I can get this right now.
[09:09.28]I can't, there's so many people, they're just not back up, back up.
[09:15.96]I was just gonna jump in, jump out, do that kind of thing, but they're already building sentries, like there's three people trying to build a sentry again.
[09:22.49]Does this guy have an Uber, or does he have crits?
[09:25.93]He has Uber, we're ready to go in.
[09:27.11]Alright, I got crits.
[09:28.35]Let's do it!
[09:29.07]You got crits and Uber.
[09:30.57]Make it happen.
[09:32.59]Make it happen.
[09:37.57]I'm getting the domination sound once a second.
[09:41.73]You're still alive, how are you still?
[09:47.32]Get that Pyro.
[09:49.22]Make that Pyro wish he was never born.
[09:53.19]Well, I just killed him.
[09:55.23]I don't know if that's what we were looking for.
[09:57.59]Well, no, because now he's dead, so he can't even know he was born because his brain is gone.
[10:03.36]I wanted you to make him wish he was never born, not, like, make him kill him.
[10:07.14]Okay, well, we need to go up top.
[10:10.16]You didn't follow my instructions.
[10:17.57]Oh, that guy.
[10:18.47]Mountain Dewboy used it.
[10:21.09]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10:22.57]Go, drop down, Uber.
[10:25.75]Is that what we're doing?
[10:27.13]Yeah.
[10:27.69]Is that what we're doing?
[10:28.88]Use it.
[10:30.76]What?
[10:32.06]What?
[10:32.26]Who did this?
[10:32.98]Take it off me.
[10:33.46]Take it off me.
[10:35.98]What?
[10:38.76]Haha.
[10:39.72]Insult to injury.
[10:41.60]Oh, it's over here.
[10:43.48]Dang.
[10:43.74]That's interesting.
[10:45.28]No.
[10:45.88]Kill it.
[10:46.57]Kill it.
[10:47.55]No.
[10:48.87]Crit.
[10:49.79]I think we got it.
[10:51.27]Yeah, the pyro has it.
[10:53.97]That made no sense.
[10:56.06]No, see, it's a flawless strategy.
[10:58.18]You go down the drop-down, it works every time.
[11:01.74]There was nothing down there.
[11:05.19]How would that many people that were just in that room... Was there nobody there?
[11:10.05]Is what I want to know.
[11:11.77]That's what I want to know.
[11:15.70]We are done once we get this last cap.
[11:19.68]And then, once we get the last cap is when we do... We've got it.
[11:23.04]...some celebration.
[11:24.43]We can... We can celebrate... We can celebrate the victory!
[11:33.71]Look, everybody jump!
[11:35.55]Jump, jump, jump.
[11:36.81]We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it.
[11:38.81]Oh shit, we didn't do it.
[11:40.65]Oh yeah, we did.
[11:43.32]I got it.
[11:43.92]Don't worry.
[11:44.90]Okay, we have to think about celebration first.
[11:47.66]Celebration, what do we do?
[11:52.24]Look how dusty I am.
[11:53.68]Oh, look at how dusty he is.
[11:55.88]You're so dusty.
[11:57.46]No, you exploded.
[11:58.66]Watch out!
[12:05.00]We did it.
[12:07.40]Congratulations.
[12:08.37]I can't do this anymore.
[12:11.47]We stayed here way longer than we should have.
[12:13.34]Yeah, we did.
