[00:08.54]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10.68]It's Grandpa here.
[00:12.40]And today, well, you haven't seen me in a while, and I know that's because I've been doing a lot of stuff.
[00:19.18]I've been getting into art class, and I've been taking yoga lessons and all that shit.
[00:24.56]So that's why you haven't seen me lately.
[00:27.23]But I'm coming right back at you with this DayZ gameplay, and I've been playing this game for the last three weeks or so.
[00:33.85]And something to remember, something of note, I've died every single fucking time I've ever played this game.
[00:39.96]So I don't have any ghillie suits or any sniper rifles or anything like that.
[00:44.26]But I live on the edge, I live dangerously, as you see right here, walking down the main road.
[00:48.71]What if somebody comes over there, Grandpa, and tries to shoot you?
[00:51.39]Well, I'll knock his fucking teeth out.
[00:52.87]That's what's going to happen.
[00:54.13]Please don't kill me.
[00:55.15]Please don't kill me.
[00:56.53]I'm so scared.
[00:58.17]I don't know what to do.
[00:59.29]I don't even have a weapon.
[01:00.30]I might as well just stand still while somebody kills me.
[01:04.82]You see, the real reason why you play this game is so you can role play.
[01:08.63]So let's start that right now.
[01:10.93]This tower has stood here for over a thousand years.
[01:16.51]And it's the rusty nails of eons of centuries of rust.
[01:23.02]And this was owned by the great Catherine of England.
[01:29.38]You know, that's not working.
[01:30.34]Let's just keep moving.
[01:34.29]I am currently on my way.
[01:37.33]Hey!
[01:40.31]Jeffrey!
[01:41.74]Jeffrey, I need to talk to you.
[01:42.88]Where are you, lad?
[01:43.60]I'm currently bleeding, and profusely from the face, and I need some bandages.
[01:55.28]I need some help here.
[02:02.66]Is anybody even listening to me?
[02:06.58]Hey, hey, look, let's work together.
[02:08.43]Come here, buddy.
[02:09.21]Come here.
[02:11.65]Just run with me this way.
[02:13.19]You got a mic?
[02:15.45]Okay, so you have successfully brought the entire town behind us.
[02:19.52]That's fantastic.
[02:21.06]I'm happy about this.
[02:22.82]So, um, where are you from?
[02:26.86]Hey, I know this might be a bad time right now, but can you give me, like, three guns or something?
[02:32.80]Shoot.
[02:33.10]Get that guy.
[02:35.68]Shoot this guy.
[02:36.36]What are you doing?
[02:37.08]Shoot him.
[02:39.74]Oh, hey, what the... And God said unto him, Eggo waffles are the best breakfast, and if you don't believe that, then you will be shot in the face.
[02:52.45]Gentlemen in the back, excuse me.
[02:54.27]We cannot have people standing during church.
[02:56.77]Please take a seat in the left or right septicles, and we will continue.
[03:01.59]You gotta explain this game to me again.
[03:02.97]The whole point, you're not supposed to just run in and just run into people.
[03:06.17]You gotta find stuff, you gotta do... No, but I mean, how do I tell people?
[03:09.75]The point of the game is not just you have to go explore, you have to get into alliances, you can't... No, I think this game is a little deeper than that.
[03:17.92]I think what this game at the core is...
[03:20.08]going into the kitchen, and finding a piece of bread, and then putting some bologna and some cheese on it, and then coming back into this room, and handing me the sandwich, and then I eat it, and that's, uh, I would like you if you did that.
[03:33.43]What if I lie down?
[03:34.23]Maybe to play dead like a bear.
[03:37.47]Wow, it actually worked.
[03:39.17]No, it didn't!
[03:39.73]No, it didn't!
[03:45.69]So yeah, what you just witnessed right there was pretty much the happenings of every time I play DayZ.
[03:51.85]If you have any tips, I'll gladly take them.
[03:54.79]Because I suck and I can't do anything and nobody talks to me.
[03:57.84]Nobody fucking responds to me when I try to talk to them.
[04:00.82]But besides all that, have a good day, everybody.
[04:05.16]Make sure you eat your cereal, your breakfast, and your Captain Crunch or whatever you're eating.
[04:09.86]And see you later.
[04:11.23]Goodbye.
