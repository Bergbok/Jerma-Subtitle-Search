[00:05.00]Now, thanks to Myth for setting that up.
[00:08.34]Go follow Myth on YouTube.
[00:09.46]He's a really good dude.
[00:14.49]That was a lot of fun.
[00:16.21]I wish I played a little better, but I was okay.
[00:17.95]Whatever.
[00:21.77]You got popular on FPS games.
[00:25.16]Guys, go back and watch my scout tutorial where I explain what A&D does.
[00:31.75]Do you understand?
[00:32.59]That's what I mean when I was saying there was boogers coming out of my nose.
[00:35.27]Okay, so A&D is a strafe.
[00:37.75]It was a different world 10 years ago.
[00:44.60]Okay.
[00:46.70]How do I spell this?
[00:50.86]Should I make my title Morty, Mortuary Morty?
[00:54.46]I think I wanted that.
[00:58.70]I think I wanted that.
[01:01.59]I think it has to be that, right?
[01:02.83]Yeah, fuck, I don't care.
[01:06.44]Yeah, it's gonna be like, like, Morty, Morty.
[01:09.12]What do you think?
[01:25.17]Is that bad?
[01:26.19]Should I change it?
[01:26.69]Dude, this is so bright in my fucking face.
[01:32.53]Why did nobody tell me this is that bright?
[01:35.22]It's way too bright.
[01:36.16]Lights off, too?
[01:37.52]Lights off?
[01:44.78]Alright.
[01:49.00]Well, this looks like shit.
[01:49.66]Why does it look so bad?
[01:55.88]Um...

[02:29.44]No, it's not.
[02:47.74]That better?
[02:49.92]That's good, right?
[02:50.48]Is that like that?
[02:53.49]A little bit worse?
[03:04.10]I think that's fine.
[03:05.02]That's fine.
[03:05.38]Alright, Mortuary Assistant.
[03:15.16]I know, like, oh, I hate Rick and Morty, but don't leave because you don't like the joke.

[06:15.61]Thank you.
[06:17.81]I'll never understand why you chose such a macabre field.

[06:22.80]It's just that I'm proud of you.
[06:25.26]I thought that was real actors.
[06:27.70]You've come so far.

[06:41.26]But my old teacher, Mr. Delver, transferred me to his office to finalize my internship there.
[06:47.62]Oh, well, that's good.
[06:48.76]I remember you mentioning him.
[06:50.90]Where's he located?
[06:52.16]Are you moving away from me?
[06:54.48]No.
[06:55.10]This feels like an AI-generated scene.
[06:57.02]He's actually located around here.
[07:00.13]Like, oh, in Blender.
[07:01.76]This is what's going to happen.

[07:38.83]Just take it, please.
[07:41.09]It should be yours anyway.

[33:21.92]That's not a big deal.
[33:23.52]No, I know.
[33:24.06]It wasn't even my fault, but he sent me home right after that.
[33:28.96]I'm just really worried.
[33:30.68]He was supposed to finalize my stuff today.
[33:33.04]And he said he would, right?
[33:34.78]TV goes on top of that, right?
[33:35.99]That's a weird place for the TV.
[33:37.49]So that's a good thing.
[33:40.25]Yeah, it just didn't feel like he meant it.

[36:49.20]Like, you laugh at that show.
[36:51.12]I know you do.
[36:52.88]You sit there with the iPad sitting on your chest, and they get into some crazy hijinks, and you kind of go, uh, that was, alright, okay.
[37:02.35]And then you slam the iPad shut because you hear somebody come into the room.
[37:04.85]You don't want anyone to think you're watching it for some reason.
[37:09.25]Who cares?
[37:09.81]Alright.
[37:12.34]I guess I'll head to the back.

[37:34.90]I'm armed.
[37:42.75]Mr. Delver, I need help.
[37:44.61]Someone's outside the mortuary.
[37:46.07]Just try to stay calm.
[37:48.55]I know you're scared.
[37:49.53]I'll unlock the door in a moment.
[37:52.69]What?
[37:52.95]This is very sudden, but listen to me.
[37:55.44]We have to start right away.
[37:57.04]He's on the phone.
[37:57.76]It's him.
[37:58.12]I'm sorry.
[37:59.76]He's calling like this.
[38:01.08]I had no way of knowing the possession had started.
[38:03.24]What?
[38:10.39]What happened to my chat?
[38:11.97]I can't read the chat.
[38:36.84]Alright, this is where I'm going to go like this.
[38:41.32]Oh, that's supposed to be him.
[38:43.52]I was going to just go like this, like jump at him.
[38:46.04]Turn that back on.
[38:46.68]What are you doing?
[39:12.29]Oh, what the fuck?
[39:15.20]You're right.
[39:15.66]The ghost is here.
[39:16.70]You're right.
[39:18.36]You should definitely come in here.
[39:19.36]It's fucked up in here, man.
[39:20.76]And then when he comes in, club him with a fucking bowling pin.
[39:30.29]Alright, let's go.
[39:32.47]Key, key, save recorder.
[39:49.90]Okay.
[39:50.16]How do I get... Is it gonna break through the windows?
[40:14.56]Ah!
[40:28.29]Alright, listen carefully.
[40:31.13]I'm sorry, but this entire thing is extremely unprofessional.
[40:36.10]If this is how you treat new hires, I don't think I can work for you.
[41:08.37]I'm back.
[41:08.77]Don't trust the phones.
[41:10.41]Anything can be manipulated.
[41:38.87]Listen to the tapes.
[41:40.65]Learn the demon's name.
[41:42.43]Burn the correct body.
[41:44.40]The most important thing in the room is in that cabinet.
[41:48.24]Open it up.
[41:50.12]I'm sorry this had to happen.
[41:56.14]This is insane.
[41:58.20]Whatever.
[41:59.36]Just be the professional one.
[42:01.31]Grab a body and get started.
[42:03.82]the part where I take the tennis ball and I just don't know what to do so I sit over there in the corner and I go like I got demons somewhere I just sit there for like 10 minutes the night shift database program combining all my findings into one reference point he could have just stayed on the phone
[42:33.47]of expulsion the tools used and most importantly all the markings of the known demonic names if you ever forget what to do replay these tapes or look it up in the database the collection of demonic names is the most crucial piece at every moment until you are unable to resist
[42:57.50]Identifying a demonic entity is a delicate balance.
[43:00.96]The further you are from possession, the more time you have.
[43:04.95]The closer you are, the more the demon will find the demon's name, allowing you the information to guess its name and the body it's bound to.
[43:14.14]The only way I've found to tell how fucking Eric is to scribble on a piece of paper, Eric.
[43:27.71]It's Eric.
[44:05.75]Just burn them all.
[44:08.77]Yeah, what's stopping me from just burning all of them and being like, hey, I just burned them all.
[44:13.93]I got the demon.
[44:16.44]Wait, should I not be doing this?
[44:19.94]Just burn them all.
[44:22.20]No, no, you're supposed to lift through all the tapes.
[44:25.48]No, you know you're not doing it right.
[44:28.88]Hey!
[44:54.53]He's like, you didn't play my game.
[45:06.90]What the fuck?
[45:08.80]Is it over?
[45:19.27]Wait, that was it?
[45:25.32]Do I have a save?
[45:42.12]Oh, god damn it.
[45:46.13]Alright, alright.
[45:46.53]Don't just be an idiot.
[45:49.85]Keys.
[45:50.17]Let's go.
[46:01.29]Alright, let's go.
[46:02.64]I'm not messing around right now.
[46:34.31]Doesn't he call?
[46:36.89]Wait.
[46:39.77]I thought he doesn't- he calls.
[46:41.51]Doesn't he call?
[46:56.04]The Night Shift database.
[46:57.74]A computer program combining all my findings into one reference point.
[47:02.50]The database contains all the information on the process of expulsion, the tools used, and most importantly, all the markings of the known demonic names.
[47:13.10]If you ever forget what to do... This one's got like Cheeto dust on it.
[47:15.90]It's this one.
[47:17.20]The collection of demonic names is the most crucial piece to the puzzle.
[47:22.88]You will need this information.
[47:24.82]Okay.
[47:30.53]Okay.
[47:32.97]Where did he say that was?
[47:33.71]I forgot immediately.
[47:34.60]Instantly, I forgot what he said.
[47:38.52]My ID is... Where is it?
[47:39.84]He said my ID is the drawer or something.
[47:58.02]weakening you until you are unable to resist.
[48:01.80]Identifying a demonic entity is a delicate balance.
[48:05.26]The further you are from possession, the more time you have.
[48:09.27]The closer you are, the more the demon will make itself known, allowing you the information to guess its name and the body it's bound to.
[48:18.43]The only way I've found to tell how far along a possession is on your
[48:26.23]Don't think about it.
[48:28.03]Just scribble.
[48:29.73]Hey, hey, hey, hey, get away from me.
[48:31.69]If you notice anything strange, it's starting to take hold.
[48:35.71]There's a notepad and a pencil on the desk in the front room.
[48:40.71]Checking from time to time can give an idea of how long you might have.
[48:47.79]Okay.
[48:48.65]Embalm each body with a special regent from the cabinet.
[48:52.43]Use the letting strips from the cabinet to attempt to reveal demonic sigils.
[48:57.35]Okay, so we gotta get a body out.
[49:18.21]OK.
[49:21.13]Alright, so we gotta get a body.
[49:22.06]And we just have to do the process of embalming.
[49:42.07]Alright.
[49:42.43]Oh, it's a different name.
[49:44.16]Robert Hood.
[49:45.76]Nothing.
[49:47.26]Cordell Armstrong.
[49:49.64]Dorothy Vaughn.
[49:51.92]Okay, Dorothy Vaughn.
[49:52.90]Come on out.
[50:06.25]Yeah, it's random.
[50:07.07]Alright.
[50:11.27]Okay.
[50:13.39]Just leave.
[50:13.93]I'm not gonna just leave.
[50:16.03]Alright, here we go.
[50:26.68]We need to do... Alright, you've got something going on.
[50:30.72]Do I need to do this?
[50:33.66]Uh... Head bruise?
[50:42.53]A couple of head bruises.
[50:46.84]Alright.
[50:47.00]How about the arm?
[50:51.06]Yep.
[50:51.32]Alright.
[50:55.34]Nothing here.
[50:59.56]Anything here?
[51:00.00]Nope.
[51:05.28]Somebody just tapped on the window.
[51:11.30]What?
[51:16.58]Is that it?
[51:16.92]I think that's it.
[51:25.23]That's it, right?
[51:28.03]Okay.
[51:35.49]Name.
[51:36.98]Age.
[51:37.20]22.
[51:37.24]Contusion in the head.
[51:40.62]Right shoulder.
[51:41.20]There's a problem.
[51:42.00]Rash on the arm.
[51:44.18]And that's it.
[51:45.58]Submit it.
[51:46.08]Let's go.
[51:47.54]Okay, give me the... The cabinet?
[51:55.55]What the fuck is this?
[51:58.28]To banish a demon to hell, it must be bound to its chosen body and burned.
[52:03.92]The three objects in this cabinet are your tools.
[52:08.28]First, the clay tablet in the center is called a mark.
[52:12.69]What is this?
[52:13.47]Placing the smaller pieces in the correct configuration will spell the demon's name.
[52:20.69]The bottles on the top shelf are a special reagent that will react to the mark.
[52:26.06]Add a bottle to the embalming mixture during the process.
[52:29.44]When the mark is placed on the correct body with the reagent inside, it will force the demon to become bound to it.
[52:37.14]Pay attention to signs that you have chosen correctly.
[52:40.86]They can be obvious or extremely subtle.
[52:44.68]Once you are certain the demon is bound to its vessel, burn it.
[52:49.26]Finally, the pieces of paper on the right are called letting strips.
[52:53.92]It must inscribe the sigils of its name in our world to begin the evocation.
[52:58.70]You will need to uncover these sigils to use them.
[53:02.36]Hold a letting strip up while wandering the mortuary.
[53:05.70]If it begins to smolder and burn, you're close.
[53:11.37]It's here!
[53:12.23]It's right in front of me!
[53:14.99]What?
[53:15.83]This thing's fucking burning!
[53:17.49]Ow!
[53:17.55]Where is it?
[53:27.35]Are you out here?
[53:27.91]Uncover the sigils.
[53:29.37]Use the night shift database to decide which demon you're dealing with.
[53:33.29]And use that knowledge to create the mark.
[53:36.44]The steps are simple.
[53:38.26]Add the reagent to the embalming mixture.
[53:40.90]Uncover the sigils.
[53:42.62]Build the mark and place it on the rocket.
[53:49.55]Am I getting close?
[53:50.89]I don't get it.
[53:53.53]This is... Ow!
[53:56.14]I don't understand.
[53:56.68]How would it just happen?
[53:59.76]This person's a demon.
[54:08.03]Sigil revealed.
[54:09.29]Where?
[54:10.49]Look for the mark now.
[54:14.59]Mark of Satan.
[54:22.20]Where's the mark?
[54:30.80]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:32.39]Turn the lights off.
[54:37.27]I don't see anything.
[54:39.39]On the furniture?
[54:42.17]In the room, on the furniture.
[54:51.93]on the wall because it could it could just be anywhere like that it was just like oh right here right it burnt up like right here it can be it can be anywhere it's yeah it has to be near where it burned right it blew up right here stop
[55:22.30]Where is it?
[55:23.04]Look on the wall.

[55:26.18]I'm looking at the wall right now.
[55:37.72]Sink?
[55:44.74]Please stop pretending.
[55:46.44]I have no idea what this wants me to do.
[55:51.20]I've lifted up the thing.
[55:52.08]It burnt.
[55:53.72]It exploded right here.
[55:55.80]And I'm supposed to... Oh my fucking god.
[55:58.08]I thought this was a clock.
[56:06.52]Okay, so that's the sigil.
[56:11.98]So, okay, now I have that.
[56:13.44]So let's go over here.
[56:15.52]Um... So where does... Now what?
[56:22.59]What mark is that?

[57:17.86]Let's go.
[57:39.20]I need more progress first.
[57:40.24]Okay.
[57:41.06]Alright.
[57:41.26]Let's start.
[57:41.58]Alright.
[57:43.28]So I need to... Shut up.
[57:47.41]Alright.
[57:48.31]Enter markings in the computer.
[57:49.43]Didn't I already do that?
[57:55.82]Yep.
[57:56.26]This is already submitted.
[57:57.02]I got the... I got to file it.
[58:08.35]Time to embalm.
[58:12.22]Why are you saying that like it was a superpower you were activating?
[58:16.14]Like that was weird.
[58:16.80]Time to embalm!
[58:20.88]Alright.
[58:21.92]I'm missing something.
[58:23.40]Alright, I need to do the... Um, where is all this shit?
[58:30.26]Okay, wire jaw needle injector and setting needles.
[58:35.78]I don't know where all this stuff even is.
[58:38.26]Needle injector.
[58:44.68]Are the lights off in here?
[58:45.54]No.
[58:45.84]Alright, where are the needles?
[58:47.14]It's not a tutorial anymore.
[58:50.84]Moisturizers.
[58:55.18]Here, right?
[58:56.07]These needles?
[58:58.61]What the fuck is this?
[59:02.11]Oh, the glass cabinet.
[59:03.03]Okay.
[59:05.85]Needle injector.
[59:07.39]Alright.
[59:08.61]Setting needles.
[59:09.19]Let's do it.
[59:23.72]Okay.
[59:24.02]I got to be honest.
[59:25.74]What is the point of doing this?
[59:29.03]What's the point of doing this?
[59:30.81]Why?
[59:31.29]Why?
[59:31.71]What's it for?
[59:32.91]Why do that?
[59:34.58]Why are the person's jaws shut?
[59:39.30]It keeps the mouth closed?
[59:49.23]So they don't have their mouths open?
[59:51.61]Alright, I need eye caps.
[59:52.95]Why did you let me die?
[60:05.44]The fuck is this?
[60:13.53]This is all your fault.
[60:35.96]Okay.
[60:37.25]Uh, insert eye caps.
[60:38.77]Where are the eye caps?
[60:40.83]I don't really know.
[60:43.57]Eye caps.
[60:45.43]They weren't in here.
[60:47.17]Scalpel.
[60:47.49]I'm going to pick it up just to have it.
[60:51.60]Little scissors.
[60:54.68]Eye caps.
[60:55.78]Yeah.
[60:56.22]Alright, let's go.
[61:05.05]Put them on.
[61:09.52]Come on!
[61:10.16]You have to click the eyes?
[61:17.20]Oh, okay.
[61:20.44]Now, we do the embalming fluid, which is all the chemicals.
[61:27.07]This is humectant.
[61:34.53]Hydrogen, whatever.
[61:35.59]No, no, no.
[61:36.27]Don't put that in.
[61:38.98]God, why?
[61:39.60]Okay, formaldehyde.
[61:57.88]Uh, the other stuff?
[61:59.44]Right here?
[62:06.10]No?
[62:08.35]I already have one of those.
[62:09.69]What?
[62:12.90]And then what's the last one?
[62:17.24]Glutaralithide.
[62:19.28]Okay.
[62:21.92]Where's the Glutaralithide?
[62:24.06]Is it right here?
[62:28.72]Yep.
[62:28.82]Alright, mix it up.
[62:41.44]Wait, I need a ragent in the old cabinet.
[62:43.61]Okay.
[62:52.78]And we're gonna- now we're gonna connect?
[62:56.20]Yep.
[62:57.72]Um...
[63:11.71]I'm missing something.
[63:12.91]I need the tube.
[63:21.87]Alright, let's go.
[63:22.35]Turn it on.
[63:55.63]Get away, Satan!
[63:59.05]Where is it?
[64:04.82]Oh!
[64:05.74]Satan!
[64:07.00]Okay, that's like a big three.

[64:18.77]Alright, so we got three L. What's three L?
[64:26.21]L, looking for L3, L3, L3, no.
[64:33.27]L3.

[64:49.92]Right there, Anik.
[64:51.64]Alright, so what do I do?
[64:52.42]How do I say their name?
[64:55.93]So now I know it's Anik.
[64:59.02]Oh, I have to put it in the thing.
[65:00.12]Okay.

[65:14.37]L3T9.
[65:28.99]Like that, right?
[65:31.31]L3-T9, take it.
[65:35.56]Now what do I do with this?
[65:59.18]Wait.
[65:59.82]Attach it to body somehow, then burn it after?
[66:02.36]You have to put it on the correct body, though.
[66:06.44]Oh, okay.
[66:12.13]Why is this body possessed?
[66:13.29]You're right.
[66:13.73]Okay, I don't know.
[66:16.89]But I know it's that one.
[66:17.97]Alright, so now this is embalmed.
[66:22.12]Fill an empty reservoir bag with cavity fluid.
[66:24.10]Okay.
[66:24.26]Okay.
[66:30.37]Yes, you can.
[66:32.41]Oh my god, go this way.
[66:36.75]Go back.
[66:42.42]Okay.
[66:47.58]Then this goes in here.
[66:54.79]Start scribbling?
[66:55.79]Where?
[66:57.77]Where do I write this down?
[66:59.43]Where?
[66:59.63]Where?
[66:59.77]Where?
[67:00.05]Where?
[67:00.37]Write anything.
[67:03.28]How do I write something down?
[67:14.41]On desk?
[67:31.56]That's nothing.
[67:32.53]I left a coffee mug on a piece of wood, but that doesn't do anything.
[67:36.53]It's a C. Okay, keep this up.
[67:48.94]Go.
[67:49.06]Go.
[68:10.57]Okay.
[68:12.61]Now, mix cleaner in the bathroom.
[68:20.93]I'm scared to... Where's the bathroom?
[68:25.68]It's right here, right?
[68:32.40]Where's the bathroom?
[68:39.00]This is not the bathroom.
[68:48.80]Where's the bathroom?
[68:52.15]Oh, it's right here.
[68:52.67]Hey, I got it.
[69:11.12]Any weird shit?
[69:13.42]Just a double check, right?
[69:34.26]What was that?
[69:50.93]Okay.
[69:51.49]Apply moisturizer.
[70:01.98]Okay.
[70:05.97]Return body to cold storage.
[70:27.42]Okay, there's only two more bodies.
[70:30.13]What's that?
[70:32.61]That's just a square.
[70:50.46]Okay.
[70:50.58]Let's go.
[70:53.72]Alright, who's next?
[70:55.04]Alright, Cordell Armstrong.
[70:56.65]Come on out.
[70:57.07]Let's go.
[71:14.06]Starts with a C. It does start with a C. You're right.
[71:17.22]That's true.
[71:30.49]Okay.
[71:33.31]It's definitely this guy.
[71:35.03]Without a doubt.
[71:39.15]It's 100% this guy.
[71:40.07]This guy's smiling.
[71:50.70]Yeah, it's definitely this guy.

[72:33.59]Right shoulder.
[72:34.25]We've got these.
[72:36.35]Left arm.
[72:38.04]Flemishes.
[72:39.52]Right arm.
[72:40.46]Curatolus.
[72:42.70]Right leg.
[72:43.12]Got a mole.
[72:43.80]Submit.
[72:44.20]Hey.
[73:07.57]Let's go.
[73:09.93]Okay, let's do it again.
[73:16.24]Oh, it's this guy.
[73:22.42]It's this fucking guy.
[73:23.20]Look at this.
[73:23.80]I'm gonna put the thing in his mouth and he's...
[73:40.90]Okay.
[73:42.22]Then it's eye caps.
[73:44.12]Those are down here.
[73:48.64]What's after eye caps?
[73:50.46]Embalming fluid.
[73:51.00]Let's just get this done now.
[73:51.92]Okay.
[73:59.31]Embalming fluid.
[74:01.07]It's this shit.
[74:05.55]This shit.
[74:10.22]And then it's this shit.
[74:14.71]And then it's this shit.
[74:17.25]Where is it?
[74:20.99]That's turning into something else now.
[74:24.17]Uh, menthanol.
[74:26.03]Where's menthanol?
[74:30.02]Where's that menthanol?
[74:33.88]Where's that menthanol?
[74:36.80]No.
[74:37.22]Where is it?
[74:40.23]I forget where it is.
[74:41.74]Over here?
[74:44.78]Yep, okay.
[74:45.54]It's on the shelf.
[74:46.16]I remember that.
[74:50.57]And then the other chemical right here.
[74:59.47]Okay, now we gotta attach the tubing.
[75:02.47]Which is... here.
[75:04.33]Okay, I need the... the... the... stabbers.
[75:09.07]Scalpel, forceps, tubing.
[75:18.16]That tube is over here.
[75:19.12]Isn't it?
[75:21.77]Yeah.
[75:29.89]I'm missing something.
[75:30.87]I'm missing something.
[75:31.79]No, you're not.
[75:32.43]You're fine.
[75:32.85]Alright, turn it on.
[75:40.10]Quick, scribble, scribble!
[75:43.88]What?
[75:44.96]Input system error.
[75:45.76]Action asset cannot be found.
[75:47.54]If you're experiencing this error for the first time, locate a poisonous material.
[75:50.65]Ingest and wait for heart rate to slow.
[75:53.33]Your flesh is wasted.
[75:54.29]Give it to me.
[75:55.93]Let me in.
[75:56.55]My glorious pleasures ache to flood your veins as you rot in torment for your sin.
[76:02.11]There is no hope, Rebecca.
[76:03.43]You will see me, Rebecca.
[76:04.55]It's a very odd Windows blue screen.
[76:13.28]Okay.
[76:14.82]Um, drink poison?
[76:18.43]Whisp poison, I can drink it.
[76:22.75]Whisp poison!
[76:23.77]Drink poison quick!
[76:27.63]Yo, I thought you'd be hiding in the middle of the place.
[76:30.55]You're dead if you throw a fucking whisper.
[76:33.05]We're heading down to the beach in just a sec.
[76:34.57]Grab your kit and get down here.
[76:35.47]Party's gonna start without me.
[76:36.79]I'm missing something.
[76:41.67]Hey, what the fuck was that thing?
[76:43.43]That's an Enderman.

[77:10.24]um what do I do wait what's that heroin kit wait heroin I'm gonna do heroin
[77:48.05]Grab the keys.
[77:53.01]Nothing on this table is interactable.
[78:05.39]No keys here.
[78:06.07]Can I just leap?
[78:14.92]Well, that's not good.
[78:24.98]Jesus.
[78:59.23]Ah, yep.
[78:59.89]We got the right one.
[79:01.53]Absolutely got the right one.
[79:03.11]Yep.
[79:03.49]No way it's not the right one.
[79:04.47]It's Anik.
[79:06.68]That's absolutely Anik.
[79:12.62]Yep.
[79:13.62]L3-T9.
[79:14.86]We got it.
[79:17.14]L3-T9.
[79:18.20]That's it.
[79:22.41]But is this the right person?
[79:23.65]How can we tell if it's the right person, though?
[79:31.07]If I put it on... Ooh, what if I... If I put it on, will it start to, like, burn?
[79:41.54]Wait.
[79:42.00]Pump him.
[79:43.64]You're right.
[79:46.88]Okay.
[79:47.72]So... What is that?
[80:04.60]It's like a U. Is it a D or a G?
[80:29.66]Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[80:34.05]Okay.
[80:34.59]Remove the tubes.
[80:35.23]Close the incision.
[80:35.85]Got it.
[80:44.19]Now we need to do the reservoir bag with cavity fluid.
[80:50.09]Which is over here.
[81:10.43]Check the computer again.
[81:13.59]Okay.
[81:24.62]I'll check the computer.
[81:34.73]Okay, history.
[81:35.75]Identifying demonic tenacity.
[81:41.56]While learning the name of the demonic entity is more about waiting, identifying which body is experiencing demonic tenacity requires paying close attention.
[81:50.09]While any of the bodies can be manipulated, it is far easier for the entity to control its own vessel.
[81:54.59]Sudden movements, large or small, can be a sign of tenacity.
[81:59.81]If a body appears to be more active than others, a strange marking starts to appear.
[82:03.83]Okay.
[82:10.17]The appearance of new markings on the body, sudden movements, repeat movements.
[82:18.69]Sudden movements.
[82:23.25]Alright.
[82:24.55]This working?
[82:27.54]Yeah.
[82:28.86]This thing is huge.
[82:31.74]So, uh, I guess, um, this is David.
[82:37.86]Alright.
[83:15.17]Shut up.
[83:16.59]Shut up.
[83:21.81]Whatever.
[83:24.87]I'm gonna burn this guy.
[83:25.57]I'm burning this guy.
[83:26.41]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[83:28.73]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[83:29.99]Circle, circle.
[83:41.90]Are you sure?
[83:58.15]Well, this is dark in here.
[83:59.72]Right on.
[84:00.04]Alright, clean the bathroom.
[84:19.13]C-O?
[84:19.93]I mean, it's definitely C-O.
[84:31.54]See, isn't this guy named like Korn something?
[84:36.03]Smiling.
[84:36.73]It's definitely this guy.
[85:03.19]I'm putting this on his head.
[85:09.22]Is it not you?
[85:10.58]Yep.
[85:10.94]Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[85:14.86]Yeah, 100%.
[85:15.96]Let's go.
[85:16.52]You're going in the fucking toilet, wherever you're going.
[85:20.61]Okay, it's this guy, for real.
[85:24.95]Well, we're going to moisturize the face.
[85:28.97]Because we have to finish that, right?
[85:39.20]I can't use that here.
[85:40.12]Alright.
[85:47.71]What if it's... Don't trust yourself.
[85:50.67]Oh, okay.
[85:54.25]Alright, back into the freezer.
[86:11.25]Of course it's this guy!
[86:12.93]It's this- Are you serious?
[86:17.57]It's this guy!
[86:18.23]It's this guy!
[86:18.80]I gotta burn him!
[86:19.70]How do I burn him?
[86:20.52]What do I do?
[86:20.88]Do I have any holy water?
[86:21.82]I thought those were eyes looking at me.
[86:32.17]I thought those were red eyes.
[86:35.45]Get over here!
[86:38.43]I got- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[86:39.67]I gotta put the thing on you.
[86:44.38]Mark him!
[86:44.96]Mark him.
[86:45.38]Mark him quick.
[86:47.88]How do I get him in here?
[86:48.58]I can't move him.
[86:54.71]Why not?
[87:25.60]Goodbye.
[87:44.27]See you later.
[87:46.27]Anak.
[87:47.07]Your name is Anak.
[87:48.55]Anak.
[87:48.91]Your name is Anak.
[87:50.81]Back to the shadow demon realm with you.
[87:53.76]Your name is Anak.
[87:55.28]Your name is Anak.
[88:22.99]what why is he still alive I got him no I got him there you are good is it over it's never over but you survived
[88:53.30]By the way, yes it is.
[88:54.76]It is $8 an hour.
[89:23.18]I've spent years learning everything I can to keep these entities at bay.
[89:28.28]It's the only thing we can do.
[89:30.98]So what?
[89:31.40]You're waging some selfless holy war?
[89:34.40]It's not a war.
[89:36.40]It's survival.
[89:38.02]And I'd hardly call it selfless.
[89:40.90]We're caught at the front line of something larger.
[89:43.50]But I don't do this for some greater good.
[89:45.96]We either face it or fall to it.
[89:50.61]I wish I could claim to be someone better suffering hell to save us all.
[89:55.99]But I simply want to live another day just like everyone else.
[90:00.05]So that when when I first experienced this, I had to make a choice.
[90:05.47]I could run and spend the rest of my days in fear, or I could learn to face it and keep some semblance of a normal life.
[90:13.43]That was pretty cool.
[90:15.77]Right.
[90:17.89]It's not a life I would want for anyone.
[90:20.50]But choosing between a life of fear or control.
[90:26.12]You're the first person I've met to face this hell and survive.
[90:30.52]So I'm offering you a different kind of job.
[90:34.43]Work the night shift.
[90:36.03]Learn what I know.
[90:37.93]Give yourself a chance at a life beyond fear.
[90:43.06]I don't know what you experienced, but I know it uses the worst parts of you against yourself.
[90:48.39]The more you experience, the more you'll confront the darkest parts of your life.
[90:53.29]But through it, you'll become unbreakable.
[90:57.85]I'm offering the tools to take control.
[91:00.55]The choice is yours.
[91:03.16]I hope you come back.
[91:05.16]This game's cool.
[91:08.30]It was not really what I was expecting, but it was kind of what I was expecting.
[91:13.66]times possessed wait so I got that was when I was in the the apartment oh okay that's cool should I do one more I'll do one more now that I understand how the game works I'll do I'll try to do one a little cleaner
[91:41.06]And then I'll take off after this.
[91:43.58]I'll be live tomorrow.

[91:56.61]Alright, let's go.
[92:02.45]So I get it now.
[92:03.21]I know how it works.
[92:06.13]What time tomorrow?

[92:15.23]I'll put this up whenever I want.
[92:16.35]Maybe two o'clock, three o'clock.
[92:17.67]Alright, let's make this quicker.
[92:33.22]Get to it.
[92:41.26]Who do we got?

[105:15.11]Wait, did they?
[105:16.49]His eyes opened.

[108:06.00]That's it?
[108:11.02]Alright.
[108:21.02]How come your face is a different color than your body?
[108:23.78]Um, it's called a combination of bad lighting, a bunch of blood in my face, and, um... I don't know.
[108:35.82]I have weird lighting, and the white balance is fucked up.
[108:45.47]I'm playing a scary game.
[108:46.43]What are you talking about?

[134:42.99]Wait, I need the gurney.
[134:52.12]Are you sure this is the right one?
[135:24.01]Oh shit, it was this guy.
[135:25.71]I was like trying to clean up the place.
[135:27.71]I was trying to clean it up.
[135:39.14]How is this guy out?
[135:40.40]This is weird.
[135:41.42]It's this guy.
[135:41.96]Look at how fucking weird that is.
[136:18.68]Yes!
[136:18.82]Gotcha!
[137:08.14]Is it the same ending?
[137:10.20]Same ending.
[137:10.80]So wait, how do I get it to be a different ending?
[137:14.52]It's nice not to be the one down there for a change.
[137:16.72]Mr. Dover?
[137:20.95]I think you can just call me Raymond at this point.
[137:24.59]Do you always just pass out and wake up on the floor?
[137:29.24]It takes a lot out of you.
[137:31.74]I've never simply walked out of here after.
[137:35.48]You get used to it.
[137:38.28]I'll be sure to clean the floors better.
[137:41.89]Raymond, will this ever end?
[137:46.41]I honestly don't know.
[137:49.18]I've been doing this a long time, Rebecca.
[137:52.38]I've traveled all over, learning everything I can.
[137:56.86]I've never found anything that could put a stop to it.
[137:59.41]Gotta iron that shirt, bro.
[138:00.81]So no.
[138:02.41]I don't think it does.
[138:04.09]So we're just like this forever?
[138:08.09]It was hard for me too.
[138:10.51]But this is the life we get.
[138:13.14]We have to face our worst selves constantly.
[138:17.52]Just stand around until you die in the next one?
[138:20.02]I'll try that.
[138:20.44]Just die?
[138:24.27]Do another run and burn the first guy?
[138:26.39]I did that already.
[138:26.85]No, that's a different ending.
[138:46.08]I burnt the... Remember I just picked somebody up and burnt them?
[138:54.14]So how do I get... You're just saying just don't do anything.
[138:56.90]Just stand still.
[139:01.68]Just let this sigil form and get possessed.
[139:13.25]I'll do a possessed ending.
[139:17.09]Death and Decay.
[139:24.92]Don't leave the apartment.
[139:51.64]Embalm.

[141:16.51]Do heroin.
[141:17.57]No.
[141:25.17]Nothing in here.
[141:44.02]Oh no, I just yawned!

[142:26.35]Alright.

[144:15.38]Wait, this is my work badge.
[144:24.03]Wait, what?
[144:29.85]Oh, I'm like an actual employee now.
[144:37.71]I don't need a password anymore.
[144:39.67]Okay, cool.
[144:59.08]Oh no, why am I so tired?
[145:01.00]Scare me.
[145:02.90]Scream at me or something.
[145:16.07]This dude thought he could handle the McDonald's order.
[145:18.21]That's it.
[145:43.19]Alright, left leg, yep.
[145:44.95]Right shoulder, yep.
[145:46.73]Left shoulder, yep.
[145:48.75]Left arm, yep.
[145:50.23]Right arm, nothing.
[145:51.41]Right leg, yep.
[145:53.41]Oops.
[145:53.95]Right leg, left leg.
[145:55.53]Submit.
[146:11.13]Oh man, that was bad.
[146:12.81]I'm awake.
[146:13.61]I'm awake.
[146:13.85]I woke up.
[146:15.25]I woke up.
[146:19.40]I'm good.
[146:19.74]I'm awake.
[146:22.96]Dude, come on.
[146:25.60]Where's the light?
[146:26.06]Alright, we need this stuff first.
[146:46.46]Eye caps.
[146:50.09]Everything I need right now.
[146:53.71]My pockets are full.
[146:56.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[146:57.69]Yep, yep.
[147:13.01]There we go.
[147:15.31]Okay.
[147:16.17]Fluid time.
[147:23.63]Fluid.
[147:25.07]It's time to make some delicious fluid.
[147:54.20]Yes, I am.
[147:54.42]Tubes.
[148:41.74]To banish a demon to hell, it must be bound to its true self.
[148:48.06]The three objects in this cabinet are your tools.
[148:51.64]First, the clay tablet in the center is called a mark.
[148:56.99]Placing the smaller pieces in the correct configuration will spell the demon's name.
[149:02.95]Second, the bottles on the top shelf are a special reagent that will react to the mark.
[149:09.31]You're not gonna mess with me.
[149:43.47]Hold a letting strip up while wandering the mortuary.
[149:49.06]If it begins to smolder and burn, you're close.
[149:52.08]When the paper combusts, the sigil has been revealed somewhere in that area.
[149:57.73]They could be anywhere.
[149:58.73]Can we turn off the Disney World line audio?
[150:01.75]Stop!
[150:02.09]Anywhere.
[150:04.91]The demon will inscribe in sigils over time to try and hide them, so check regularly.
[150:10.89]Once you uncover the sigils, use the Night Shift database to decide which demon you're dealing with.
[150:16.65]And use that knowledge to create the mark.
[150:19.79]The steps are simple.
[150:21.59]Add the reagent to the embalming mixture.
[150:24.27]Uncover the sigils.
[150:25.97]Build the mark and place it on the body.
[150:28.77]Then, when you're certain, burn it in the retort.
[150:33.21]And remember, the most important rule.
[150:36.73]Have fun on Splash Mountain.
[150:48.56]1970, the year of arrival of the house of death.
[150:52.04]What the heck?
[151:08.95]Come on, where is it?
[151:20.70]I don't need this job.
[151:22.22]See you later.
[151:22.74]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[151:26.62]Alright, that's about... I'm gonna call that a... I don't know, a hearthstone symbol.
[151:40.41]Did you move?
[151:43.47]Oh, we need the bathroom cleaner.
[152:02.78]And then we got to moisturize and then I don't know.
[152:06.20]I'm not getting anything from this guy.
[152:07.52]I'm not getting anything from this guy.
[152:11.46]I don't think it's him.
[152:11.94]Alright, we know it's this one, right?
[152:17.57]Hearthstone symbol.
[152:29.27]I'm missing something.
[152:32.05]Don't do it right.
[152:36.83]But the wrong so OK, right, wrong symbol.
[152:43.31]Now get it right.
[152:52.76]Don't get it right.
[152:54.34]Do not get it right.
[152:55.28]Secret ending.
[152:57.23]Do it right.
[152:57.93]Well, I mean, I don't... It's not this guy, so that's... I know that pretty much for a fact.
[153:03.96]It's not this guy.
[153:18.45]Who's there?
[153:25.87]Yeah, let's do a poll.
[153:27.51]Alright, run a poll.
[153:28.07]Do you want me to get it right?
[153:31.19]Or do you want me to get it wrong on purpose and get a different ending?
[153:34.71]I need to get it twisted.
[154:04.72]Okay.
[154:08.42]Are you moving?
[154:39.88]I'll get it.

[159:04.12]I'm missing something.
[159:13.26]Okay.
[159:18.95]Now let's begin this.
[159:19.95]Uh, we need the fluid.
[159:23.37]Okay.

[161:21.08]Nope.
[161:23.24]Okay.
[161:23.80]It could be Telduck.
[161:28.66]Telduck?
[161:35.97]No, that's probably Telduck.
[161:46.57]Telduck.
[161:47.95]Alright, what's Telduck?
[161:52.40]Pi, Hearthstone, Bong, and J. So we need to find... So it's Bong and J. So that's definitely it.
[162:07.89]Bong was at top, right?
[162:12.42]Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, J. Okay.
[162:26.29]Okay.
[162:26.91]So that's done.
[162:27.69]Uh... Right.
[162:32.76]Incision.
[162:34.64]Don't scare me, idiot.
[162:38.16]I need a scalpel.
[162:39.52]Oh, I forgot to put... Okay.
[162:44.14]What are you talking about?
[163:05.52]Let's pump!

[164:04.08]Turn that off.
[164:06.27]Close it up.
[164:09.17]What?
[164:12.31]What's wrong?
[164:16.81]Something does feel weird.
[164:17.75]I feel like I've been permanently changed.
[164:24.75]Okay, let's go back here.
[164:32.98]Don't even do it.
[164:34.66]Don't do it!
[164:35.24]Okay, the AC just turned on.
[164:41.65]And I felt something touch my arm.

[165:21.28]No, close those.

[168:05.93]See if something weird happens with you.
[168:15.44]Yeah, I mean, come on, look it.
[168:26.86]Do we even really need to do this or should I just burn him?
[168:39.28]It's definitely this guy.

[175:40.05]I'm going to go left.
[175:42.29]I make my own way.
[175:51.20]David Whitlow.
[175:53.30]December 8, 1949.
[175:56.18]Oh.
[175:59.60]Somebody said Abraham Lincoln.
[176:01.56]Sorry.
[176:10.47]Um, what?
[176:28.49]Jesus.
[176:36.33]What the hell was that?
[176:52.82]How do I get in there?
[177:11.58]Alright.
[177:12.94]There was a keypad under a thing here, right?
[177:16.97]I remember.
[177:17.33]I was like, what is this for?
[177:23.90]It's like down here, right?
[177:24.76]Yep.
[177:24.94]1-9-7-0-4-4.
[177:26.74]Key to the hatch.
[177:27.48]Let's go.
[177:27.86]Oh, God.
[178:11.73]Just coming to get a refill man.
[178:26.26]I'm missing something.
[178:40.51]Shit, it's too much.
[178:42.13]Give me a tail deer.
[178:50.16]Somebody just give me a tail.
[178:51.70]Somebody read it for me.
[179:09.60]Okay.
[179:30.37]The raging is the blood of the possessed.
[179:34.59]What the fuck?
[179:36.75]Thanks for the yeah.
[179:38.59]Spoilers, by the way.
[179:39.45]Thanks guys.
[179:43.96]Oh, here we go.
[179:45.38]Good, I don't have to read.
[179:46.28]It'll just tell it to me.
[179:54.73]This is Raymond Delver.
[179:57.95]I know this will sound crazy, but I believe I am being possessed.
[180:03.81]If I am to disappear, know that it was not of my own free will, and that I am a danger to anyone I may encounter.
[180:13.44]I should be killed on sight.
[180:15.26]Oh, shit.
[180:15.88]So he's a demon.
[180:17.78]Sounds terrible.
[180:19.18]But the woman locked in the basement must also be killed, man.
[180:25.20]Dermamy?
[180:27.78]If you are experiencing possession, the blood of the possessed will react to the name of the demon present.
[180:37.47]Injecting the blood of the possessed into a deceased body with demonic tendency will act as a reagent for revealing possession and form the foundation for binding the demon to the body.
[180:50.13]Then it can be marked with its name.
[180:51.49]Whoa.
[180:51.61]The heck, dude?
[180:53.47]What the fuck?
[180:54.09]Okay.
[181:20.38]No, they're not personal pizzas.
[181:32.17]What?
[181:35.18]Did that guy get up?
[181:43.57]Open the door?
[181:44.29]I don't... I can't.
[181:45.49]There's another... There's an old key in the drawer with the ID in it.
[181:51.56]You shitting me?
[182:01.13]Oh, man.
[182:03.09]Wait.
[182:03.57]How do I pick it up?
[182:06.43]Mr. Delva's extra keys.
[182:08.19]How do I use them?
[182:11.13]Why can't I pick them up?
[182:18.45]Okay, well, let's go.
[182:19.40]Yeah, fuck that guy.
[182:23.41]Who cares?
[182:51.51]Wait, that's a... that's TTT9.
[183:38.54]Who are you now?
[183:42.13]Yes, yes.
[183:43.95]Look at you, look at you, look at you.
[183:47.87]Is Raymond here?
[183:48.79]Do you see what he's doing?
[183:52.48]Who could do this to someone?
[183:55.52]I think you should let me out.
[184:01.55]You ain't going anywhere.
[184:03.01]Shut up.
[184:07.79]I want wishes.
[184:09.31]I want wishes or you ain't going anywhere.
[184:11.53]I want wishes.
[184:12.59]You'll be here soon.
[184:15.70]I want wishes and I'll let you out.
[184:17.12]Three of them.
[184:25.73]It's a simple trade.
[184:27.75]I let you out?
[184:28.89]You give me three wishes.
[184:30.31]You give me whatever I want.
[184:35.10]But you have to promise not to kill me when you get out.
[184:37.14]That's my, that's what I have to say.
[184:39.52]I know every time that in a movie when this happens, it's typically...
[184:44.43]oh I summoned fucking Voldemort whatever and they just like the second they get out they kill the first person which is usually the person that summoned them right and why is that that's fucked up can we go over this just very quickly that's fucked up every time that's in any video game in any movie any TV show the guy that spends his entire lifetime
[185:08.21]Summoning or bringing back the ultimate bad guy is the first person for the ultimate bad guy to kill.
[185:16.81]It's unfair.
[185:19.73]That's absolutely not fair.
[185:24.74]Do you know how hard it was to bring you back?
[185:32.34]That's unfair.
[185:43.96]I'll mark this one down as a maybe.
[185:46.90]Maybe we'll come back.
[185:52.63]What about Peter Pettigrew?
[185:54.25]Alright.
[185:56.61]All I remember from Peter Pettigrew is this.
[185:58.55]That's it.
[186:04.98]That's all I remember.
[186:26.25]Alright, so now what?
[186:28.72]It's this guy.
[186:32.40]Smiling.
[186:34.68]Go get her blood?
[186:37.04]Wait, go get her blood?
[186:40.64]Get the blood.
[186:41.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[186:42.22]You mean go get the blood that was next to her and use it here?
[186:45.19]Or should I use it?
[186:51.29]The bottles of her blood.
[186:53.88]All the regions are her blood.
[186:55.52]Yeah, that's what I'm imagining.
[187:00.60]Yeah, this is all her.
[187:04.04]Yeah, it's all this is all her.
[187:06.86]I already have it, yeah.
[187:09.58]That's scary.
[187:11.68]Alright, where was I?
[187:14.18]Right, we have to do this.
[187:19.05]That was scary.
[187:22.30]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[187:23.56]Let me... Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[187:26.27]Come on, come on.
[187:26.73]I gotta get back into this before I die.
[187:27.95]Get the, uh, get the tubes.
[187:46.17]Okay.
[187:48.73]And let's pump.
[187:54.36]What's wrong?
[187:59.56]What's wrong?
[188:03.43]It's your grandma.
[188:04.65]You already did this.
[188:05.51]I need you to let me in.
[188:13.44]Wait, here comes... Let me in, you bitch!
[188:15.82]This is it.
[188:19.38]Don't you love your grandma?
[188:23.58]I just wanted to visit you.
[188:25.70]No, no, I didn't want to let you in.
[188:27.02]Don't you miss me?
[188:31.30]I brought you something.
[188:35.89]I thought maybe you could slit your wrists for me.
[188:41.41]Just a little cut.
[188:45.15]Oh, what's wrong, Rebecca?
[188:51.92]Don't be
[188:58.28]I ain't ever inviting grandma to Christmas ever again.
[189:12.24]Sorry, I was wondering, I was like, why can I not press the button?
[189:22.39]Alright.
[189:23.71]Pump.
[189:24.97]Turn off pump, remove tubes, and fill.
[189:46.36]Oh!
[189:52.61]How do I?
[189:53.13]Somebody said, go kill the basement lady.
[189:54.67]I don't know how.
[189:56.33]How do I do that?
[189:59.05]Oh, shit.
[189:59.57]Something's going to happen.
[190:00.35]Something's about to happen.
[190:01.08]Something's going to happen.
[190:01.78]I'm sitting in the corner.
[190:12.68]Her mark.
[190:14.89]Oh, wait, it was tear, tear, parka, parka, tear, parka, parka, tear.
[190:22.19]I can't do it.
[190:27.01]I can't do it.
[190:33.07]What?
[190:33.49]Yeah, I can't.
[190:34.86]It's three tees.
[190:40.96]This tiles in the basement.
[190:45.54]Ah, whatever.
[190:51.13]What is it again?
[190:53.97]Such YouTuber reactions.
[190:55.51]Alright, who was this?
[190:58.63]It was Telduck, right?
[191:00.20]Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, Jay.
[191:04.44]Bong, Hearthstone, Pi, Jay.
[191:08.28]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[191:10.02]Why does the thunder scare you?
[191:11.36]I don't know, because it's just sudden.
[191:13.68]Alright.
[191:15.09]Come on, hurry up.
[191:17.03]Stop it!
[191:17.23]I'm fine.
[191:21.89]I'm fine.
[191:51.02]There we go.
[191:53.38]Okay.
[191:55.16]Let's put you... No, I don't want to leave.
[191:58.56]I don't want to go back in here because the grandma's here.
[192:00.72]Uh oh.
[192:12.89]Oh, don't you want to say hello to your grandmother?
[192:15.75]I'm so scared.
[192:18.27]Don't you want to say hi to your grandmother?
[192:29.15]No, don't you want to say hi to your grandmother?
[192:43.35]It's definitely you.
[192:44.79]I've got the coins, right?
[192:45.69]Alright.
[192:52.16]Okay, it's time, it's time, it's time.
[192:53.28]Put this bird on.
[192:55.82]So you're saying if I do this now,
[193:07.95]I get a super ending.
[193:20.58]You think it's the wrong one?
[193:24.82]I wonder if it's the right one.
[193:30.03]OK, so now I'm going to get a secret ending.
[193:35.15]I have 10-year coin, 5-year coin, and the necklace.
[193:39.18]Am I good?
[193:52.78]Surely, surely, surely.
[193:56.77]Double-check your stuff.
[193:57.77]Yeah, I got my coins, and I got the necklace, right?
[194:04.13]See you later.
[194:06.63]What?
[194:09.47]What are you talking about?
[194:13.02]Um, what?
[194:14.94]Where's the fucking power?
[194:17.46]Where's the power?
[194:31.77]Oh no.
[194:32.79]He's gonna get up.
[194:43.18]Oh, I just fell.
[194:45.74]I just literally tripped.
[194:48.24]There was nothing scary.
[194:49.08]I just tripped on the rug.
[194:50.01]How do I turn it on?
[195:10.02]What?
[195:10.34]I need the tiles from the basement?
[195:15.97]I don't want to go back in the fucking basement.
[195:25.95]Dude.
[195:52.10]Where?
[196:09.67]Oh, you were full of shit.
[196:10.49]Okay, never mind.
[196:16.45]I think it might be bugged.
[196:28.99]You didn't moisturize?
[196:29.72]Yeah, I did look.
[197:10.36]What?
[197:31.97]Why won't he go on?
[197:35.21]You need to finish all the blocks.
[197:36.25]That's the last one.
[197:38.01]I did it all.
[197:39.67]There's a fourth body and there's none.
[198:04.26]Um.
[198:06.90]What?
[198:16.54]It bugged out?
[198:22.55]Yeah, I tried the fuse box in the bathroom.
[198:24.29]It didn't do anything.
[198:26.61]I think this is screwed up.
[198:36.34]Check your tablet?
[198:39.00]There are no tiles in it?
[198:41.30]Yeah, there is.
[198:45.67]No, that's correct.
[198:48.95]I think it's screwed up.
[198:53.11]Um, there's reload the game.
[199:18.11]Okay, return body to cold storage.
[199:24.17]So, we're back.
[199:27.61]This is it right here.
[199:28.81]Take the mark.
[199:33.87]Here we go.
[199:35.57]Yep, looks good.
[199:39.16]Come with me.
[199:53.34]Alright, we're back in cold storage.
[199:54.64]Is that good?
[200:01.44]No.
[200:07.15]Burn.
[200:08.69]There we go.
[200:09.53]Alright, let's go for it.
[200:13.99]I got the coins, right?
[200:14.95]Yep.
[200:22.18]Okay.
[200:24.07]Who's knocking?
[200:33.98]Got it.
[200:34.94]Ow.
[200:59.32]So this is a secret ending?
[201:10.29]Raymond.
[201:11.15]It's not a secret ending.
[201:12.23]I'm here.
[201:13.41]I can't believe you.
[201:16.47]What you've been doing.
[201:17.49]It's not a secret.
[201:18.85]Monstrous.
[201:20.12]I've said already that I've had to accept everything about myself.
[201:24.58]Just like you do.
[201:26.67]This is a necessary.
[201:27.73]Secret Raymond ending.
[201:30.05]She's down there right now.
[201:32.28]Just suffering for no reason.
[201:34.88]Valerie is not down there.
[201:38.18]Not anymore.
[201:40.22]She's been gone for years.
[201:42.19]You don't know that.
[201:46.47]You're just going to let her stay there.
[201:49.16]You don't know what she's feeling.
[201:51.74]You are torturing her.
[201:53.38]She's helping me survive.
[201:55.46]She's helping us survive.
[201:59.07]Without her, there's no reagent.
[202:01.99]Without the reagent, we have nothing.
[202:05.81]You want to have a chance at life, it comes with a cost.
[202:09.24]This cost.
[202:11.08]You have to make a choice.
[202:12.89]Just like I did.
[202:13.93]What choice?
[202:15.37]Keep her alive to just bleed her over and over again to save ourselves?
[202:20.39]She can't be saved.
[202:22.09]End the torture.
[202:23.99]She's down there suffering for your own gain.
[202:26.45]My gain?
[202:27.67]My gain.
[202:29.76]You used her too.
[202:31.84]It didn't stop you from finishing the job.
[202:34.76]You used her blood anyway.
[202:37.43]When it came down to it, you chose survival.
[202:41.29]Just like I did.
[202:41.85]Actually, you never told me that.
[202:44.03]I did not come with a context of what was necessary to know that.
[202:46.79]I can't kill her, Rebecca.
[202:49.97]I know it's the right thing to do for her.
[202:52.71]I know.
[202:54.11]No, you drank it too.
[202:55.77]What?
[202:59.07]I've seen many experience what you did.
[203:02.32]None have survived.
[203:05.02]I've watched them degrade and suffer until they're no longer themselves.
[203:10.74]I didn't know what else to do.
[203:12.78]I couldn't just let them suffer.
[203:16.82]I searched for years to find a way to reverse it.
[203:20.63]All I found was the way to prevent more.
[203:24.45]Isn't that better than nothing?
[203:28.11]I've killed them all, Rebecca.
[203:30.89]It was the only thing I could do.
[203:33.88]So yes, I am a monster.
[203:37.38]But this one horrible thing has prevented me from having to take any more life.
[203:42.77]And I would choose that again and again.
[203:47.93]I can't live with any more death than I already do.
[203:53.83]I've made peace with it.
[203:56.29]The choice is yours if you can too.
[204:00.17]I'll see you tomorrow.
[204:10.58]Ending four of five?
[204:11.72]Wouldn't that have been three?
[204:13.89]Wait, have I done this four times?
[204:14.93]Alright, that was fun.
[204:21.67]Oh, okay, I see.
[204:26.23]You messed up the coin ending.
[204:27.40]You need to get the coins and necklace from the apartment, then pick up two more coins from the drawer in the mortuary.
[204:33.70]Oh, well, whatever.
[204:34.46]Alright.
[204:36.98]Alright.
[204:38.22]Get the possessed ending.
[204:40.38]No, I gotta go.
[204:41.64]I'm hungry.
[204:42.97]And I don't want to... I've been sitting here for a while.
[204:46.31]I know it doesn't seem that long, but I'm still dealing with some problems.
[204:54.85]It's because you're scared.
[204:57.85]This was... This is great.
[205:01.55]The scares were really interesting.
[205:04.39]Turning the corner and just kind of seeing a person just standing there.
[205:08.27]It's just weird.
[205:08.75]It's creepy.
[205:11.33]This is fun.
[205:13.25]Mortuary Assistant.
[205:18.09]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[205:18.97]Tomorrow we're going to play Two Point Campus.
[205:22.13]And maybe something else.
[205:23.69]Cult of the Lamb is out too, right?
[205:24.79]Maybe I'll do that.
[205:27.16]Two Point Campus is going to be sponsored.
[205:30.88]And, you know, I was thinking about playing it, so that's awesome.
[205:34.08]The sponsor streams have been amazing, by the way.
[205:36.82]It's just stuff that I want to play.
[205:39.04]Stuff that I'm really interested in playing.
[205:40.80]Like, I just, I'm already interested.
[205:43.40]So, that's been great.
[205:46.73]Cult of the Land is not sponsored.
[205:48.91]Yeah, I would just be playing it.
[205:53.93]So, I'm really happy about it so far.
[205:57.37]I hope the sponsor streams have been good.
[205:58.77]I obviously want to play games that people would probably want to watch.
[206:06.46]Call to the Lamb is a 10 out of 10.
[206:13.06]Maybe I'll open with that.
[206:15.41]Play that for like 2-3 hours and then do Two Point Campus for a few hours.
[206:20.01]We'll figure it out.
[206:23.25]The sponsor streams feel like a normal stream.
[206:25.38]That's really what I'm looking for.
[206:35.04]Alright, cool.
[206:36.73]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[206:37.79]We're going to start probably around like 2?
[206:40.07]2 p.m.?
[206:41.19]3 p.m.?
[206:42.87]We'll make it 3, just in case.
[206:49.25]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[206:50.03]The Call of Duty tournament was really fun.
[206:53.15]It's cool to hang out.
[206:53.85]Play with Myth, Psychuno.
[206:59.56]I want to get these guys over to Multiversus, you know what I mean?
[207:02.16]Psychuno played Multiversus the other day.
[207:04.50]Yesterday or whatever.
[207:13.67]I love that game.
[207:17.95]Let's play the game I'm good at.
[207:19.31]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[207:27.78]Thanks again.
[207:31.34]If you're still here from Connor.
[207:34.40]Cool.
[207:35.52]Went a little bit late.
[207:36.60]Started late, though.
[207:47.17]Green Screen Part 2 is going to be on Sunday.
[207:52.31]That'll be the last real stream that you see here until baseball.
[208:00.63]Because we're probably going to do just a little hangout session before baseball.
[208:03.99]Kind of like Dollhouse.
[208:06.85]I'm not going to be giving that much info because it's not as elaborate as Dollhouse was.
[208:11.91]But you need to know about the game being played in the background.
[208:15.87]I had to kind of explain that before the stream.
[208:19.84]But we'll hang out.
[208:20.58]I'll talk about it.
[208:21.48]Try to hype it up a little bit.
[208:27.73]This is not the right music, by the way.
[208:29.51]This music is scary.
[208:32.93]You need to explain the rules of baseball to chat.
[208:40.94]August 19th.
[208:43.33]At 4.30 p.m.
[208:44.65]Pacific.
[208:45.83]Be here.
[208:48.80]The Jerma Baseball Association.
[208:52.26]That's in the middle of the season, so.
[208:58.44]Good night, guys.
[208:59.68]Call your mother.
[209:01.00]Take care of yourselves.
[209:02.10]Have a great day.
[209:02.54]Have a great night.
[209:04.93]And goodbye.
[209:14.47]Thank you.
[209:49.07]Thank you.
[210:47.26]you
