[00:05.86]Do earwigs do that?
[00:07.94]Okay, so when I see an earwig, and listen to this music, right?
[00:14.12]Imagine an earwig looking up at you, and he's like... And I'm like, oh, get the envelope!
[00:22.59]Save him!
[00:23.15]And I get the envelope, and I'll get him on the envelope, and I put him outside.
[00:26.74]Am I just creating another 5,000 earwigs?
[00:39.52]And then the next day, it's like three that you see.
[00:41.68]And you're like, oh, wow, cool, let's save these three.
[00:45.15]To the same fucking soundtrack.
[00:50.21]Oh, save us.
[00:52.59]Here come another 50 in your house.
[00:54.33]And they're all dancing in a line.
[00:57.96]Doing one antenna, two antenna, one antenna, two antenna.
[01:00.96]Top hat, top hat, top hat.
[01:03.10]It's like, wow, 50 earwigs.
[01:04.36]Oh my god, they're so cute.
[01:05.74]Get the envelope.
[01:07.05]They all start crawling on it.
[01:08.29]You get them out.
[01:08.83]You save them.
[01:09.73]Save the earwigs.
[01:11.93]And then, you know, me lying down in bed three days later.
[01:15.13]And I'm drifting off to sleep.
[01:18.21]Ah, what a nice day that was today.
[01:22.01]And the second that I fall asleep and I go into REM, they can sense it.
[01:26.31]And 2,000 earwigs just make a trail up the bed.
[01:28.30]And just go into my brain to this music.
[01:32.66]And they all going in, digging in, like...
[01:35.52]I'm eating pieces of my brain matter.
[01:37.98]And I'm just asleep.
[01:40.77]And some of them are still dancing with the top hat.
[01:46.12]Is that what you think?
[01:46.76]Is that what you're saying is going to happen to me?
[01:56.45]Oh, because I saved the earwig.
[01:58.20]I didn't want to kill the earwig.
