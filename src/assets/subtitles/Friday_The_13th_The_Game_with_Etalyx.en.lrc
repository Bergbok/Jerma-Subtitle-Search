[00:00.75]Okay, I'm back.
[00:03.65]We're going to play Fred of the 13th.
[00:07.04]Let's get that audio here.
[00:09.86]But first, hold on.
[00:11.00]I need to do something really quick.
[00:17.13]Quick enough, that is.
[00:17.93]Mm-hmm.
[00:29.34]I need to quit this for a second.
[00:38.01]Go into my mixer.
[00:41.69]That's better.
[00:45.19]Let's try it again.
[01:00.02]windows 10 everybody loves windows 10 just kidding they don't how could you like windows 10 I actually don't mind it I think it's okay microphone activated alright I am uh pretty much ready to I've just been looking up like the how to play
[01:21.78]Oh, so you're gonna tell me how to play?
[01:23.40]You're gonna give me all the rundown?
[01:24.64]I've been just glazing through.
[01:26.22]There's not a tutorial, there's like 30 PowerPoint slides.
[01:30.52]So haven't you seen Jason though?
[01:32.34]You've seen the movie Jason, right?
[01:34.80]Um, yes, the movie Jason, yes.
[01:37.24]Yeah, in the movie Jason... Whoa!
[01:40.32]That was loud as... I did!
[01:43.84]I already did!
[01:45.77]yeah for some reason the first note that comes out of the game is incredibly loud no it's one of those games that like has to has to connect to itself to find out what your cloud saved audio settings are when you get into the game alright anyways uh so how do we play together uh I believe there's a way to
[02:10.59]create a party which I am doing now okay and I believe we have to be online for that to be a thing okay cool so while you're doing that so are you are you in the game yes uh I am in the main menu and I just made a party I'm gonna change this to
[02:37.60]Friday.
[02:38.92]Not the 13th.
[02:42.44]But the game.
[02:45.55]Not the game.
[02:53.07]Friday the 13th.
[02:53.59]Yeah, we are ready to go.
[02:59.21]You guys don't like my joke?
[03:02.47]What was the joke?
[03:03.19]My stream title is Friday, not the 13th.
[03:04.93]Oh yeah, I need to change that.
[03:08.62]cool joke come on give me give me a break alright I'm gonna switch this over to the game actually let me appear so you can uh invite me do you yeah you're making like a private party or
[03:28.14]Uh, well, there's a thing that says party.
[03:31.40]It doesn't say whether it's private.
[03:32.95]I assume it's private.
[03:34.07]It says I'm joining it.
[03:35.71]Okay.
[03:36.49]So it should be.
[03:37.52]Joined party.
[03:38.82]Apparently I'm in your party.
[03:43.96]Alright, I'm not sure what to expect.
[03:46.16]From what I saw in the how to play thing, there's like a bunch of things to interact with.
[03:50.14]Like if you want to escape in the car, you got to have a battery, gas, keys.
[03:54.43]If you want to call the police, you got to fix the phone lines and find out how to dial the car.
[03:59.79]There's like a bunch of little things that interact with each other, basically.
[04:02.97]Okay.
[04:04.51]And there's like a fear meter.
[04:07.54]So when Jason's like chasing you, your character gets afraid and you have to...
[04:13.31]basically let that settle down like your insanity meter I guess okay and the more afraid your character is the easier he can find you did you customize uh anybody no I am going in completely vanilla alright so how do I get that uh we're gonna have to talk to people right
[04:40.08]uh I probably should look at the settings for that I think we should I kind of would rather be scumbags and just you just want to not want to talk because it's going to be one of those things where people are going to be like hey Jesus is over on the side he's over by the cabin I just turned voice volume to zero okay maybe I'll do that too I don't know we can always turn it on later because I feel like at the beginning they're just going to be yelling at us for not knowing how to play
[05:07.22]Well, that's okay.
[05:08.84]We'll get screamed at.
[05:09.94]I'm fine with that.
[05:11.15]That's why I just muted voice volume.
[05:15.49]It defaults to push to talk.
[05:18.49]Did you mute copyrighted music just in case we could sue?
[05:23.11]Is that an actual setting or is this a Ubisoft game?
[05:26.66]Okay, I guess I will mute copyrighted music.
[05:32.10]There is an actual setting for that.
[05:34.68]Yeah, I guess there is.
[05:37.96]Okay.
[05:39.04]So... Are you in my party?
[05:46.19]Yeah, you are.
[05:47.07]Hi, Greg.
[05:48.39]Hi.
[05:49.85]I need to turn you up a little bit.
[05:52.43]Can you talk for a little while?
[05:54.49]Just say, like... Alright, I'm going back into the audio settings because apparently I did not push apply, but I did.
[06:02.20]And voice volume is down, copyright music... Oh, okay.
[06:05.44]We're gonna mute copyright music.
[06:07.34]Confirm.
[06:09.04]Back out to the main menu and work.
[06:10.64]Am I done?
[06:11.90]Yeah, you're good.
[06:12.96]Okay.
[06:13.80]He's good now, right, guys?
[06:16.37]I put him up 6.5 dB.
[06:20.68]Now he's too loud.
[06:22.02]We'll figure that out.
[06:25.38]I'll just talk very quietly.
[06:27.90]I'm going to role play that we're actually in the woods and we need to be quiet so that Jason doesn't hear us.
[06:33.08]I hope I get Jason first and I get you first.
[06:36.40]Wow.
[06:37.77]I hope you get Jason first and I kill you before you can kill anyone else.
[06:42.07]I hope you get Jason and then I find you and I put the trap underneath you and then you get Jason and then I put the trap under you and then I win.
[06:49.78]I hope that someone else gets Jason.
[06:50.77]Are you ready?
[06:51.15]I didn't know you were ready.
[06:53.31]Yeah, I'm ready.
[06:54.19]I'm ready to go.
[06:54.83]Alright, let's go.
[06:55.99]You didn't even say anything.
[07:00.59]One thing, you're telling me to talk for complete sentences so you can fix my volume, and next you're yelling at me.
[07:05.79]I can't do this.
[07:08.31]Just get screamed at, buddy.
[07:09.67]Too much pressure.
[07:10.44]I'm going to listen to the Pamela tapes.

[10:16.99]It says you joined the party.
[10:17.89]Okay, I'm connecting again.
[10:23.77]Next time we do a stream together, can we just roleplay tech support and Grand Theft Auto or something like that?
[10:28.74]Well, I mean, now this game is full.
[10:30.96]So I'm going to have to leave this game.
[10:33.94]How am I connecting to it?
[10:35.20]I don't know.
[10:38.14]I'm closing the party.
[10:41.50]So... I just clicked on private match.
[10:47.48]Okay, hold on a second.
[10:49.41]I have seen people playing this game together.
[10:51.25]You want to see me versus you?
[10:54.99]See if you can do that.
[10:56.65]Just see if you can do that.
[10:57.87]Okay.
[10:59.71]Can you just join my, like, okay, you can join my, like, settings.
[11:03.37]Can I, like, open this up to the public now?
[11:06.37]No.
[11:10.67]Okay, I'm going to close the lobby.
[11:12.41]Give me a fucking break.
[11:15.77]You were kicked.
[11:17.05]Yeah, okay.
[11:17.81]So there's no way to open that up to the public.
[11:20.25]no um so I'm gonna invite you again we're gonna try this one more time before we just do private games seriously like at least we can like figure out the controls we need more friends to someone that is that's true in more ways than one okay well let's try this again quick play the reason we don't I didn't think we needed to test this out ahead of time because
[11:46.66]It seems like the kind of game that everyone's already playing together.
[11:50.82]Well, they had like a beta to fix this kind of shit.
[11:53.88]The game's out.
[11:54.54]This is not the beta.
[11:55.36]The game is out.
[11:56.01]Alright, I'm in.
[11:57.45]You're probably not going to load it.
[12:07.67]The party system is broken right now, apparently.
[12:09.49]Alright, what happens if you join me right now?
[12:14.56]Okay.
[12:15.10]Can you just join the game right now?
[12:16.30]Is there still room?
[12:17.00]Yeah.
[12:19.10]I am connecting and loading.
[12:21.03]Okay.
[12:21.35]Oh, God.
[12:21.87]What a great fucking game.
[12:23.61]We're in.
[12:24.15]Fantastic video game.
[12:29.75]You want to hear me rage about this?
[12:32.81]I will.
[12:33.33]Just create a party system that does not work.
[12:37.50]So what do we have to do?
[12:39.04]Pick somebody?
[12:41.99]I'm just going to leave it at random.
[12:43.86]I'm Jason.
[12:46.24]I think that's like you can have multiple outfits and perks and then choose which perk set you want.
[12:56.26]Should I be my brother?
[12:58.94]It looks like my brother.
[12:59.72]I don't even know who this is.
[13:08.69]These characters somebody said there's a fat guy where oh he's like the last one I Die he's there locked.
[13:17.49]Yeah, they're all locked until a certain level So we have like four or five people we could be You ready?
[13:26.15]So the name the game here is to stay alive, right Yeah, I think you actually have to ready up
[13:34.03]on the right hand side of the menu page game starts in a minute anyways yeah how many maps are there I'm not sure I think there's at least I think this is the second one I've seen she's random at the bottom but who
[13:55.39]Why does everyone want to be the same girl?
[13:57.21]Four people have this girl.
[13:59.05]Everybody wants to be this girl.
[14:01.61]Am I the only person that wants to be my brother?
[14:03.43]I guess that would make sense.
[14:06.16]It does kind of look like you.
[14:11.66]I'm the only dude.
[14:15.90]I think there's three maps in the game total.
[14:20.28]For some reason, I just assumed there was only one.
[14:22.02]Alright, we ready to do this?
[14:24.36]Am I going to force people to ready up?
[14:27.77]We got 19 more seconds until it kicks us out to the main menu.
[14:31.79]I mean, until we get to play.
[14:35.99]Alright, so give me a rundown on how to do this.
[14:37.61]How do you play this game?
[14:41.23]W-A-S-D?
[14:41.83]W-A-S-D is how to move.
[14:43.80]Don't go after Jason.
[14:45.22]You can, but don't.
[14:47.85]and we need to like find each other kind of but also split up find each other kind of but also split up like stay where we can you know take the heat off of each other okay but not like follow each other around necessarily okay but we should probably we should probably do that to start off with you know just to kind of get a feel for everything everybody loaded I have the best ping in the server that means I win right so is it actually random who becomes Jason I think so
[15:20.54]Please don't be me.
[15:22.04]Actually, I kind of want it to be me.
[15:25.42]Who is it?
[15:27.32]That's Jason right there, right?
[15:28.30]There he is.
[15:29.64]There he is.
[15:30.84]Oh shit, he's going to get my brother.
[15:31.98]Is this so loud?
[15:35.40]It is pretty loud.
[15:38.16]Alright.
[15:39.36]I am JonTron.
[15:40.66]What the fuck is happening?
[15:44.21]Alright, so we have to stay alive, right?

[15:55.32]Oh yeah, me neither.
[15:56.28]I'm just looking in the first house that I come across and just hoping I find something good.

[16:26.70]I'm going to be the first one to die.
[16:29.02]No, you just hold it.
[16:29.90]You just hold it and lock the door.

[19:52.08]Okay, I heard the music.
[19:54.98]I don't have anything.
[19:58.89]You have a lock?
[19:59.29]He probably knows we're in here.
[20:00.51]It's locked.
[20:01.71]The music just got scarier.
[20:03.23]Yeah, the music just got way scarier.
[20:05.25]I'm ready for him when he opens the door.
[20:10.23]Alright.
[20:10.87]Oh my god.
[20:11.31]He's gotta be in the room with us, right?
[20:13.11]I'm ready to slice his throat like a fucking orange when he opens the door.
[20:17.85]He's gonna block the door and just hack both of us to death.
[20:20.41]Oh yeah?
[20:21.41]This is my brother we're talking about here.
[20:22.75]He's got fucking strong forearms.
[20:24.13]Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[20:27.52]He's right there.
[20:28.04]He is right here.
[20:29.70]He's right here.
[20:33.16]He's like looking under the bed for us right now.
[20:37.17]He's looking under the bed for us?
[20:38.83]I don't know.
[20:39.13]I think so.
[20:39.63]I saw a movement.
[20:42.87]There's another guy outside.
[20:44.09]Are you sure that's not Jason?
[20:47.45]It wouldn't show us where Jason is on the mini-map, right?
[20:49.97]Are you sure?
[20:50.43]I'm pretty sure.
[20:54.20]Are we going to stand in here all day or are we going to make moves?
[20:56.89]I think this is a good spot.
[20:58.19]What do we have to do?
[20:59.53]We have to get rescued.
[21:01.29]No, we have to either fix the car, call the police, or do something else productive.
[21:06.89]Otherwise, they'll just eventually get us.
[21:09.25]Okay, that's fine.
[21:12.55]You'll get it.
[21:13.66]I can't get it.
[21:15.20]Where do you want to go together?
[21:18.06]Uh...
[21:19.99]I don't know let's just head towards some other guy and see what they're doing you don't make sure you open up all the crates because there could be like weapons and stuff I think the guy that was already in here like searched this house already well I have the machete is definitely the weapon of choice in my opinion unless you can get a gun I'm heading out so we have repaired so you have where's the gas uh we'll just try to remember that it's in this house if we find the car okay
[21:50.03]Alright, there's another guy over here.
[21:51.19]Around the campfire, I think.
[21:53.21]So can we swarm Jason?
[21:56.35]And just smash his face in?
[21:59.67]Can I come in there too?
[22:00.53]Alright, let's just use the tent.
[22:03.85]I want to just get in the tent too.
[22:04.91]Hiding in plain sight.
[22:06.19]He'll never know.
[22:06.87]He'll never find us.
[22:09.71]Now this is dumb.
[22:11.66]Yeah, it's not a good idea.
[22:13.58]We'll be waiting there a long time.
[22:14.92]Evergreen, alright.
[22:19.24]Wait, what the fuck was that?
[22:25.11]You can just run and dive through windows?
[22:27.51]Wait, how do you do that?
[22:29.79]Okay, what?
[22:30.31]I hear... You sprint and then tap E when you get... Like, just hit E when you get close.
[22:37.78]Is he in here?
[22:38.60]I don't know.
[22:39.16]He might be.
[22:40.96]I'm not sure.
[22:41.42]Let's find out!
[22:42.44]This place is definitely...
[22:47.97]Okay, the police are on the way, don't worry.
[22:49.39]Doctor, police are coming!
[22:51.97]Okay, so we have to last for five more- five more minutes.
[22:56.01]Yeah, just- just come on in here.
[22:57.59]It's safe!
[22:58.47]Nice, good job!
[23:00.19]It's the face they make after they land.
[23:01.83]Alright, you go- your face is like all bloody.
[23:07.19]Help me!
[23:08.75]Help me?
[23:09.77]Oh, he's cutting me up all over.
[23:11.63]Oh, shit.
[23:12.31]Our, like, fun and games is over, Etalyx.
[23:13.93]I broke my arm.
[23:14.81]Did you injure yourself?
[23:16.76]Yeah.
[23:17.02]I got a broken arm.
[23:18.50]I've got to care for the... Oh, no.
[23:20.59]Help me.
[23:21.15]Oh, your arm's broken, too.
[23:22.85]Anyone?
[23:23.87]All I did was crawl through.
[23:25.03]I didn't even dive.
[23:25.81]Oh, wait a minute.
[23:29.41]The lights just turned out over here.
[23:30.47]The lights just went out.
[23:33.63]Oh, now we're all slow.
[23:35.75]And our arms are broken.
[23:37.97]Let's run towards the other guy out here.
[23:39.45]Let's go back to the tents.
[23:43.85]Oh, this is terrible.
[23:46.34]Where is he?
[23:47.95]I don't know, he's gotta... What happened to him?
[23:49.71]He's gotta be in there.
[23:50.23]Uh oh, the screen's getting dark.
[23:52.85]Wait, are we both bleeding to death?
[23:55.41]We could be bleeding to death.
[23:57.19]No, that can't... We were just playing... Mom's gonna be so mad at us for breaking our arm.
[24:01.34]Alright, I have an idea.
[24:02.92]I wanna like rest in the tent.
[24:03.86]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[24:04.48]Just rest in the tent.
[24:06.06]We'll be fine.
[24:06.62]Everything's gonna be alright.
[24:12.47]Alright, I need to get my stamina back.
[24:15.23]My screen is going back to normal.
[24:17.18]Yeah, I think we just sprinted too much.
[24:20.14]Okay.
[24:21.32]Alright, I'm good.
[24:23.02]Do you hear that screaming?
[24:24.08]Yep.
[24:24.64]Where are they?
[24:24.98]Does that sound like someone dying?
[24:27.34]Yeah, somebody who's just dying.
[24:31.69]Freedom has been murdered.
[24:36.43]It's up too close to the fire!
[24:39.73]Oh!
[24:44.10]It's almost like we're trying to cook inside of our mouths.
[24:47.98]Why are our mouths just stuck open like this?
[24:51.94]Wait, what the fuck is this?
[24:53.02]I killed both of us at the same time.
[24:57.90]Who would have ever guessed that that would happen?
[25:02.30]I'm free.
[25:02.92]Did you get killed?
[25:07.90]Yeah.
[25:08.98]Okay, you gotta be good at Talics.
[25:10.22]Yeah, I got this.
[25:11.76]It's okay.
[25:12.98]It's okay.
[25:13.58]I'm just gonna jog my way on over to the old evergreen.
[25:16.28]He's just cutting through the grass right now.
[25:20.18]He's trying to choke slam me.
[25:24.46]Oh my god.
[25:26.32]Oh my god.
[25:35.58]Not unexpected.
[25:41.42]What?
[25:42.16]He, yeah.
[25:43.38]He teleports.
[25:44.55]Oh.
[25:45.89]Okay, it's just her.
[25:49.11]It's the girl with the flare gun.
[25:51.15]I'm not going to do it again.
[25:56.61]I hope that that other guy who died was just spectating both of us standing around the campfire.
[26:03.39]And was just like yelling at us.
[26:05.56]What is she doing?
[26:06.98]I thought she was still alive.
[26:10.70]The girl is.
[26:12.02]No.
[26:13.76]She's hiding behind a tree.
[26:15.30]Yeah.
[26:15.98]No, she's crouched behind a tree.
[26:21.44]Looks like a pretty good spot.
[26:22.64]What is she holding?
[26:23.35]She got some money in her hand?
[26:27.77]Jason is a player.
[26:28.51]He's not an NPC.
[26:30.92]Yeah, I feel like we'd have to play as Jason at least once to figure out what he can see to know if we're hiding.
[26:37.04]To know what to do.
[26:40.72]We were just sitting there screaming at the fire and all of a sudden he came in.
[26:44.85]Yeah, somebody... Somebody... It looks like she's... Wait, what?
[26:54.49]What is she holding?
[27:00.49]What is that?
[27:01.53]Using Skype is cheating.
[27:02.65]What are you talking about?
[27:04.99]We're both dead.
[27:07.05]We're not cheating.
[27:08.67]Oh, she's waiting for the police to arrive in 35 seconds.
[27:11.53]Oh, okay.
[27:11.95]Does the police pull up here?
[27:13.25]I have no idea.
[27:14.53]Maybe.
[27:14.81]Yeah, screaming at the fire was not a valid strategy.
[27:19.22]Why not?
[27:19.44]I don't know.
[27:20.48]It seems like it's working out.
[27:24.06]Seems like she's going to win.
[27:24.96]Why not on Skype?
[27:26.10]What the hell are you guys talking about?
[27:29.78]It's cinematic cam right now.
[27:31.32]Doesn't somebody show up with a gun?
[27:32.62]Like, don't you get to show up with, like, a rifle or something?
[27:35.12]There's a guy that can come back as a gun.
[27:36.94]You have to call or radio or walkie-talkie the guy, and it'll kind of, like, left for dead bring you out of the room.
[27:48.49]Asthma inhaler.
[27:49.25]I'm going to laugh.
[27:59.08]Alright, so the police should be arriving right now.
[28:03.42]What is in her hand?
[28:05.08]Still haven't figured that out.
[28:05.76]I don't know.
[28:08.54]Do the cops, like, show up in a certain spot?
[28:09.88]I have to assume so.
[28:12.82]But I can't see the map.
[28:15.47]Look, that was just figuring out the controls and walking around and breaking through glasses.
[28:19.07]That was the joke.
[28:19.63]That was just a trial.
[28:20.53]That was the goofy joke one.
[28:21.85]We're not doing that again.
[28:25.49]This one's going to be the real one.
[28:31.08]This girl's doing some really good sneaking, though.
[28:35.19]You can switch to, like, the camp camera, but I'm not sure why.
[28:43.15]Just in case he's, like, prowling around somewhere over there, I guess.
[28:46.33]I'm sure he's taking the long way.
[28:52.97]She's holding a fidget spinner.
[29:01.48]Anybody who's anybody's got one.
[29:04.34]Is it weird that I want one of those?
[29:07.38]I kind of do too.
[29:08.47]Like they just look like fun just to hold.
[29:14.08]Just make a little buzzing noise.
[29:15.38]Like, who cares if they think you're a middle schooler?
[29:18.70]You know those things are causing a ton of problems in school?
[29:22.36]Yeah, I do.
[29:22.76]Because everybody has one, and they're all constantly going at the same time.
[29:25.94]So it just sounds like there's an air conditioner going at every clock.
[29:29.91]Oh, no.
[29:31.45]What?
[29:32.31]The body just, like, flew across as he teleported behind her.
[29:35.57]Oh, he teleported behind her.
[29:37.57]I thought she was just dead on the ground.
[29:38.83]Oh, no.
[29:39.13]Okay.
[29:39.33]Okay.
[29:41.23]Maybe it was a vision of her being dead that she saw.
[29:45.35]I don't know.
[29:47.21]Did she just like half vomit?
[29:50.99]I think she's gonna get away.
[29:52.67]She's running out of stamina.
[29:53.88]There's the cop car.
[29:55.64]What the hell?
[29:58.18]Oh shit.
[29:59.74]Oh no, she's dead.
[30:01.14]It's over.
[30:01.62]Right in front of the cops.
[30:03.48]The cops are right there.
[30:04.38]Just like walk over here and point your guns at them.
[30:06.10]Oh god.
[30:06.28]What will we lose?
[30:13.47]In spectator mode, I think the teleport is masked if you're actually playing with an on-screen effect.
[30:21.56]That's my good boy.
[30:23.32]But spectating, he just appears out of nowhere.
[30:26.00]He just kind of... Come home, sweetie.
[30:29.42]Alright, this time, no fucking around.
[30:31.09]Let's get it for real.
[30:37.61]This is fun, though.
[30:40.71]The police were so close.
[30:44.21]I got 600 XP.
[30:45.07]I don't know.
[30:46.31]I got the level 2.
[30:47.27]Jason's name is like... Isn't that like a Twitch meme?
[30:55.42]What?
[30:56.18]13 BTW?
[30:56.90]Yeah.
[30:58.72]Probably.
[30:59.46]I'm not as hip as I used to be on all the new memes.
[31:02.24]Okay, so I leveled up, right?
[31:04.74]So that means... Did I unlock somebody?
[31:06.02]I unlocked these two people.
[31:08.40]Strength.
[31:08.82]Okay, the guy that you were playing has a lot of strength.
[31:13.19]My guy had no composure, but he had a ton of luck.
[31:19.27]Okay, I can hear people talking.
[31:26.94]Oh, wait, are we turning on voice chat?
[31:29.12]No.
[31:30.24]Oh, so how do you hear people talking?
[31:32.04]I just heard somebody go like... Okay, um... I gotta think of something fun to say.
[31:38.88]How about, uh...
[31:44.18]something that would be like somebody would think was funny I'm really fun in real life though that guy left t is push to talk is it hey yeah did you hear me uh no because I have everyone in the game muted oh right
[32:18.17]Hey, good luck.
[32:19.16]Have fun, guys.
[32:22.30]It's a nice loading screen.
[32:23.34]This guy's eyes are getting gouged out.
[32:25.90]So this is a new map?
[32:28.10]Uh, yep.
[32:28.92]Because... Alright, is this guy streaming the game, or is this a twitch.tv, like, employee's email?
[32:33.11]You know what I mean?
[32:35.25]Like, yeah, that's my, like, you know, just at twitch.tv.
[32:37.23]That's my email.
[32:39.91]I feel like that's an email.
[32:40.89]Shoot me a line if you want to get partnered.
[32:43.79]Let's go.
[32:44.87]You guys got 500 ping.
[32:45.51]Bro, your ping is fucking insane.
[32:47.98]Who does?
[32:49.70]Never mind.
[32:50.06]It went back down to 60.
[32:53.12]Alright.
[32:53.69]So we're going to play for real this time, right?
[32:55.25]This is playing for real.
[33:03.09]Hey, Carnage TV isn't here.
[33:04.55]Carnage TV isn't here.
[33:08.94]I hope that they make a Michael Myers version of this game.
[33:12.50]Probably.
[33:12.94]I heard.
[33:17.84]Do you have them unmuted so you can hear what they're saying?
[33:19.86]Now you can hear them.
[33:22.87]Alright, I guess I'll unmute them too.
[33:24.11]I think maybe I want them to make a Chucky one too.
[33:27.19]Remember Chucky?
[33:28.11]That was awesome.
[33:31.31]Oh, except you're going to come through.
[33:34.86]Am I not coming through for you?
[33:36.44]No, I know.
[33:36.88]If I enable, I can mute you individually.
[33:41.46]So I don't hear you twice.
[33:48.16]That was holding.
[33:48.80]Shut up.
[33:53.49]This is perfect.
[33:55.89]Does he know who you are?
[34:03.07]He said I sound like Jerma985.
[34:09.14]I gotta get my voice.
[34:10.40]Hold on.
[34:10.64]I gotta get a buttery voice.
[34:11.66]Okay.
[34:16.86]God damn it, I need to get my voice buttery.
[34:18.12]Hold on a second.
[34:19.20]What's the push-to-talk key?
[34:22.81]P. E?
[34:24.35]T. Well, that's that interact button.
[34:27.14]Thank you.
[34:28.74]Okay.
[34:31.89]What are you talking about?
[34:33.89]T. Oh, T?
[34:35.87]T as in Thomas.
[34:37.19]I can't believe you killed them.
[34:39.35]Shit, dude.
[34:39.77]My voice is not buttery enough to talk on voice chat with a fake voice.
[34:43.32]I'm Velma.
[34:44.46]I am hot, sexy Velma.
[34:46.44]I am... I don't know.
[34:49.08]Generic person number four.
[34:51.48]So here's the car.
[34:52.48]So gasoline and a battery, right?
[34:55.16]And a key?
[34:57.46]Gasoline, battery, and a key.
[34:58.86]Yep.
[34:59.94]Alright, well, this is a bear trap.
[35:03.31]I'm going to put it right here.
[35:06.25]I got a flare gun.
[35:07.33]What happened?
[35:08.03]And what is happening?
[35:13.23]We won.
[35:15.59]Someone who didn't want to be the guy was the guy.
[35:18.07]How did we win?
[35:20.39]We already fucking won.
[35:21.79]The guy who was playing the guy quit.
[35:24.31]It's the guy that was playing Jason had to leave.
[35:25.63]Yeah.
[35:27.87]He probably didn't want to be Jason.
[35:29.51]The guy that didn't want to be Jason.
[35:31.01]Alright, give me one second, guys.
[35:32.02]Give me one sec.
[36:19.85]Microphone activated.
[36:21.35]Okay, we're good.
[36:22.95]Instead of taking care of some business.
[36:25.27]Alright, business taken care of.
[36:27.99]I want to be Jason.
[36:29.19]I want to be Jason too.
[36:33.33]I want to be Jason too.
[36:34.87]Buttery voice incoming?
[36:36.94]No, I mean, I need... It's not going to happen.
[36:42.12]Hey, if you click on... If I want to talk in voice chat, go ahead and just click on my speaker next to my name.
[36:47.62]And you can mute me.
[36:48.30]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[36:52.43]oh come on this game just came out there we go that's because everyone's trying to join with a friend and they can't that's true so they all get in and they're like hey uh you're not in here and then they back out incoming joke what if there's no incoming joke how do you do a joke on the loading screen yeah what joke could I do right now guys
[37:20.65]See, why can't there be two J- Hold on.
[37:22.41]This is better.
[37:22.89]Like, this is better if I do this on voice chat.
[37:27.96]I'm gonna talk.
[37:28.50]Hold on.
[37:29.56]I gotta mask.
[37:30.20]I gotta do better masking my voice.
[37:36.88]You should do, uh, two Jasons.
[37:40.82]Your two Jason fight between two Jasons would be actually pretty fun.
[37:46.05]Even though I have you muted, you're still echoing.
[37:58.71]You can have one Jason be on one team, like red team, and the other Jason be on blue team.
[38:05.15]Everyone else is so quiet.
[38:07.95]Just one team should have the real team.
[38:10.88]Okay, I'm done.
[38:12.28]What?
[38:12.80]Is this guy ready up?
[38:14.18]You are up, bro.
[38:14.96]Come on, man.
[38:20.14]El Mori.
[38:22.39]Okay, there's only 13 seconds.
[38:23.79]It's automatically readying us so we can play the video game again.
[38:29.46]From everybody over here, on behalf of everybody at FBI Entertainment, I hope you enjoy the game, guys.
[38:34.24]What, am I a dev?
[38:35.54]What the fuck am I doing?
[38:36.42]FBI Entertainment.
[38:40.75]I'm trying to be like a dev.
[38:43.77]FBI Entertainment.
[38:46.15]I fucked it up, too.
[38:47.13]I was like, I'm FBI.
[38:51.56]Let us know what you think.
[38:52.45]Hope you guys have a ton of fun playing.
[38:55.81]Thank you.
[38:57.73]This guy thinks it's like real.
[39:19.08]I hope I'm Jason.
[39:20.92]Damn it.
[39:23.10]I can't believe he killed them.
[39:24.85]Okay.
[39:26.63]We're starting inside a house.
[39:29.35]I see somebody's close to me.
[39:30.27]Is it you?
[39:30.79]It might be.
[39:31.77]No.
[39:32.57]No?
[39:33.67]Not you.
[39:35.57]What are they drinking?
[39:38.19]Are those Budweiser's in skinny fat bottles?
[39:41.60]Wow, that's weird.
[39:45.28]Bed?
[39:45.94]No.
[39:47.10]What are you doing?
[39:49.50]There is somebody in here, though.
[39:52.08]It's me.
[39:52.72]There's just two of me.
[39:56.87]Alright, lock the door.
[39:57.63]Uh, there's nothing even here.
[40:02.85]Uh, I just got attacked by... Did you already get attacked?
[40:06.59]No, it's by a friendly.
[40:09.03]Shit, I hear him.
[40:10.60]Is that... Are you sure we can't see Jason on the map?
[40:13.14]Because I see a very intimidating red marker on my map right now.
[40:16.84]If it's red, then probably.
[40:18.08]Okay, shit.
[40:18.80]Hold on.
[40:22.07]How do I put this down?
[40:23.35]How do I put this down?
[40:24.41]I don't know.
[40:24.91]I haven't figured that one out yet.
[40:26.31]Place a trap.
[40:26.99]I'm going to bait him in here and I'm going to make him step on this.
[40:31.47]Oh, shit.
[40:31.87]I heard a loud noise.
[40:32.85]Oh, shit.
[40:33.09]I heard another noise.
[40:34.39]Where's that noise coming from?
[40:35.45]I don't know.
[40:36.41]I got an actual map.
[40:39.23]Huh?
[40:39.63]What?
[40:41.61]I'm just going to stand right next to the trap and he's going to walk in it.
[40:44.37]Don't be the first one to die.
[40:46.20]Where is he?
[40:48.80]He's in the house.
[40:51.43]Where is he?
[40:53.11]Where is he?
[40:53.37]Close the door.
[40:54.83]I got a first aid kit.
[40:56.13]If you could take damage.
[40:57.15]I see a guy.
[41:01.59]I'm okay.
[41:03.07]Can I hide under the couch?
[41:05.46]Alright, he's gonna come in the front door.
[41:09.46]Watch this.
[41:11.18]Oh no, don't get me.
[41:19.90]Well, I'm glad he's distracted by you.
[41:26.29]Come on, let's play.
[41:27.98]I got him distracted.
[41:29.56]Get to the car.
[41:32.60]I got him distracted.
[41:33.30]He's not gonna get me.
[41:37.81]What's going on?
[41:39.25]Sounds like he's here.
[41:40.55]Oh, wait, wait.
[41:43.13]What are you doing?
[41:44.31]Why are you hitting me with like a pan?
[41:46.17]Can I push up?
[41:46.77]You just screamed.
[41:48.41]I can't.
[41:48.73]There's nothing I can do about this.
[41:49.77]I gotta go.
[41:50.19]Are you fighting?
[41:50.83]Give me the pan.
[41:51.35]Give me the pan.
[41:54.95]What?
[41:55.81]Oh, my God.
[41:56.95]Hey, are you near like three other people?
[42:00.55]Yeah, I'm here.
[42:01.69]I'm with like three people.
[42:03.45]Okay, I'm coming towards you.
[42:10.45]I don't want to hide.
[42:21.53]Is he coming in here?
[42:23.39]I don't see him.
[42:27.32]Can he climb in windows?
[42:29.18]I think he can break through windows if you're like really close to one.
[42:32.52]He's right here.
[42:33.10]He's waiting for me.
[42:33.88]He's waiting for me to come out.
[42:36.34]Uh, it ain't gonna happen, man.
[42:37.92]He's going for you.
[42:38.86]He's going for you.
[42:39.50]He's going for you.
[42:39.99]He's going for somebody else.
[42:40.81]I'm going.
[42:41.01]I'm gonna be a fucking rogue right here.
[42:41.97]You motherfucker!
[42:42.39]Give me the trash can!
[43:00.59]Somebody tell me where the car is.
[43:01.75]It's got to be on the map, right?
[43:02.73]It's got to be straight ahead.
[43:03.69]Save me!
[43:04.33]Save me!
[43:05.77]I'm sorry.
[43:09.06]Stay with me.
[43:12.30]I won't attempt you.
[43:13.18]You got to push the mouse button down.
[43:16.69]No, it's the right mouse.
[43:18.31]I thought you could hurt him.
[43:25.58]Wrong one!
[43:26.46]It's a minigame!
[43:27.08]Alright, I gotta find you.
[43:28.94]There you are.
[43:29.24]Do the minigame.
[43:30.94]You're okay.
[43:31.44]I don't think he's near you.
[43:32.48]For a little while, at least.
[43:35.26]Oh, this minigame is... I'm sorry.
[43:40.08]Tell me if he's coming.
[43:40.90]Are you dead?
[43:41.89]I'm dead.
[43:42.35]I distracted him for a little while, and then went after him with a pan, and I... Alright, so note to self, this is the second game.
[43:50.97]Third game, don't hit Jason with any objects, because you can't kill him.
[43:57.88]Oh, you just keep pulling the button down.
[43:59.42]Okay.
[44:00.22]I did get points, though, for fighting back.
[44:02.18]For hitting him in the back of the head with a frying pan.
[44:07.39]There's a car!
[44:07.89]What?
[44:09.01]There's already a working car here.
[44:11.67]Who's car?
[44:11.89]Somebody's here to pick me up.
[44:13.09]Are you about to, like, GTA this person?
[44:15.68]I'm in the passenger seat now.
[44:17.22]I was going to fix my own car, and somebody just came and scooped me up.
[44:20.12]Wait, you can drive cars in this game?
[44:22.80]Apparently so.
[44:23.94]Okay, this game just got inherently more interesting.
[44:28.56]Where are they driving?
[44:29.52]Who are you guys driving to?
[44:30.21]I have no idea.
[44:31.05]Well, we just crashed into a fence.
[44:38.55]Holy shit.
[44:39.99]It started.
[44:40.59]Are you serious?
[44:41.81]Jason's taunting.
[44:43.17]Run him over.
[44:43.75]Fucking run his ass over.
[44:44.93]Oh, no.
[44:45.65]Run for it.
[44:56.48]That's so funny.
[44:59.52]She just crashed the car into a fence.
[45:02.61]That just got crap.
[45:05.27]This game is awesome.
[45:08.15]Alright, where are you?
[45:08.83]I'm watching you.
[45:11.41]I'm trying to run.
[45:12.13]I'm gonna follow this guy, I guess.
[45:16.05]Oh no, she's struggling here.
[45:17.21]I got some firecrackers I can drop if I need to.
[45:21.85]You guys are together.
[45:22.62]That's a big house.
[45:25.13]I feel like this is a bot.
[45:26.85]Is this not an NPC that I am with?
[45:28.59]No, that has to be a player.
[45:32.38]That's definitely not a bot.
[45:34.88]Why are you splitting up, dude?
[45:36.48]Because he's being chased.
[45:39.10]No, why did I do that?
[45:41.96]Controls suck.
[45:44.31]You gotta close that door and you gotta bar it up.
[45:46.25]Okay, I locked the door.
[45:52.43]Is this one locked?
[45:53.33]It is.
[45:54.17]Okay.
[45:56.29]Now just hide under the bed for 14 minutes.
[46:00.86]The police arrive in three minutes.
[46:02.88]Yeah, but you have to actually get to the police.
[46:06.00]True horror is around here somewhere.
[46:07.40]Alright, what can you see from under here?
[46:13.12]Nothing.
[46:13.76]I just see what you see.
[46:15.92]I didn't know what I could see if I was under the bed.
[46:20.93]Yeah, you actually have to walk to the police car, right?
[46:26.41]Do I want to lock this door?
[46:28.29]Well, she's dead.
[46:29.03]Do you know where any gas is?
[46:37.81]Is he in the room with me?
[46:40.42]My screen just... My screen just went nuts.
[46:46.34]There's like four people together.
[46:49.82]Did he just break in through one of the windows?
[46:51.92]I don't know.
[46:54.22]But there's a lot of people alive apparently.
[47:06.46]Nice.
[47:07.02]Nice.
[47:07.36]Good job.
[47:09.14]I'm going to be wounded now, aren't I?
[47:12.34]Oh, God.
[47:16.27]Oh, watch.
[47:17.01]What am I watching here?
[47:18.13]Oh, we scared of fireworks.
[47:20.37]Good job.
[47:20.71]I forgot.
[47:25.01]Jason's weakness.
[47:27.39]Firecrackers.
[47:28.93]Yeah.
[47:32.39]That was a good fall animation.
[47:34.23]I'm running out of stamina, Jerma.
[47:37.77]I mean, you got away from him.
[47:40.91]For now.
[47:41.37]Okay, these people are all just joking around.
[47:45.12]They're just jumping around?
[47:47.62]There's four people joking around.
[47:55.17]How afraid is my character right now?
[47:56.51]I don't know.
[47:57.99]I can't tell.
[47:59.45]Jason's gonna come in here and just Dynasty Warriors left click a hundred times on these people.
[48:04.03]I gotta find them.
[48:04.75]Safety in numbers, man.
[48:06.67]All he has to do is get in this room and mash X and he'll Dynasty Warriors the whole room.
[48:14.82]Are they all gonna try to gang up on him and beat the shit out of him?
[48:20.52]Oh my.
[48:22.24]That scared me.
[48:22.98]Oh fuck.
[48:24.09]There's a bear trap on the ground?
[48:27.95]Oh, here he comes.
[48:29.15]He's coming for me?
[48:30.49]He's like in this room with his five survivors in this house.
[48:34.07]Oh.
[48:34.89]You scared me.
[48:36.87]Thought you meant he was coming.
[48:37.89]What?
[48:39.15]Oh, he is close to me.
[48:42.65]Is he just saying, what are you doing?
[48:45.97]He just hit his leg with a bat accidentally.
[48:49.67]Something's not right here.
[48:51.93]I don't think this is supposed to be happening.
[49:05.48]What the fuck?
[49:06.60]That was fantastic.
[49:08.90]Jason was just standing still and this guy just missed a hundred times with the bat.
[49:15.20]And then he hit this lady in the face with the bat and then Jason broke his neck.
[49:25.05]Ooh, nice.
[49:27.39]They're like fighting over there, then, is what you're telling me.
[49:30.29]Why does that freeze tag him?
[49:32.35]Okay, if you hit him with a melee weapon, it's freeze tag.
[49:35.78]Jason, stand still for like 10 seconds.
[49:39.96]So he's just going ham on them right now.
[49:42.04]There's like a group of like three or four.
[49:43.56]I see them.
[49:44.06]I found them.
[49:44.98]The police are here.
[49:45.66]I'm going to get to you.
[49:49.77]All I have to do is use this person as bait and make sure that she gets eaten before I do.
[49:55.38]Oh, you're in deep trouble.
[49:56.98]I know.
[50:00.93]We're both out of stamina.
[50:02.49]He's gonna be right behind me, isn't he?
[50:06.05]I'm the one that's running slower.
[50:07.37]Yep, you're the one that's gonna die.
[50:10.94]You're the dead one here, I tell you.
[50:12.80]I am the dead one.
[50:14.52]The music's getting so loud!
[50:16.88]He's right behind me!
[50:24.09]The police were right there.
[50:33.63]I know.
[50:37.22]You're trying to save this person and they went the wrong way too.
[50:41.26]You were trying to split up to make it harder for Jason, and you both went the wrong way and made it easier for him.
[50:46.00]Well, I didn't go the wrong way.
[50:47.20]Jason was standing in between me and where the police were, so I guess I should have just tried to sprint around him.
[50:53.97]And now this person is absolutely dead.
[50:55.91]No, no, no!
[50:57.03]Get in the car and turn it on.
[50:59.15]That's the car that he, like, slashed with the, uh... Make sure you use the bug spray.
[51:06.68]That was Axe's body spray.
[51:08.28]She wanted to smell nice and clean.
[51:10.37]She just has to get down there.
[51:11.39]I mean, at this point, she's done.
[51:17.34]Like, she's not going to make it.
[51:18.22]So she's accepting her fate.
[51:19.90]Nice.
[51:20.58]She just killed him.
[51:21.92]She just fucking... She killed him.
[51:25.32]She hit him directly in the face with that axe and it killed him.
[51:30.18]Wow.
[51:31.44]He's getting up.
[51:34.01]He got back up.
[51:38.53]And he just teleported right behind her.
[51:40.55]And the police aren't there.
[51:41.39]They're at the other side.
[51:42.43]Oh, the police aren't there.
[51:43.87]Do it again.
[51:44.29]Do it again.
[51:46.21]Come on, right in the face.
[51:47.54]Like that, asshole!
[51:51.98]Will he get back up this time?
[51:55.92]I don't know.
[51:56.52]He's like Kane.
[51:57.84]He really is like the Undertaker.
[52:01.80]Oh, he's hiding.
[52:03.16]He does the Kane when you just like get up at like 90 degrees.
[52:09.05]I can't even follow anybody.
[52:10.15]There we go.
[52:11.39]I had to push space.
[52:13.39]Oh, he has to know where she is.
[52:19.01]Yeah, you just did.
[52:21.71]Shut the door.
[52:22.49]Oh, that's the wrong door.
[52:26.31]You're not going to be able to board that up at this point.
[52:28.85]Just hide under a bed.
[52:30.83]No, he can definitely see.
[52:35.89]Shut the door.
[52:36.39]You've got time.
[52:37.99]Okay.
[52:38.83]Oh wow, that was a beautiful, beautiful juke there by Jason.
[52:45.50]She's gotta be running out of stamina.
[52:49.66]That was a serious Kool-Aid man right there.
[52:52.44]That was a Kool-Aid man.
[52:53.08]That was beautiful.
[52:53.84]Uh oh, she's retching.
[52:55.19]It's over.
[52:56.79]Although this is kind of like a little cat and mouse game.
[53:01.03]This is a little cat and mouse.
[53:03.63]Good spot for her.
[53:04.61]But that's why you can't go through the window over and over again without getting injured.
[53:07.33]Because they would just do it over and over again.
[53:12.66]She should have made it around the side first.
[53:14.10]I mean, can't he see through walls?
[53:20.08]I don't know.
[53:20.52]I think he has an ability where, like, I don't know what the cooldown is, but... I don't know what the rules are when they're crouching, though.
[53:25.70]Because otherwise, what's the point of crouching?
[53:29.57]Oh, he didn't even see.
[53:32.31]But she screamed.
[53:36.95]I guess.
[53:42.65]Now's her chance.
[53:43.95]This is the only opportunity she's going to get.
[53:45.67]Yeah, we are shoutcasting Friday the 13th right now.
[53:53.52]Alright, and she's decided to take the crouching opportunity right now to regain a little bit of stamina.
[53:57.95]Very interesting move because Jason does have that teleport ability.
[54:01.79]Every 38 seconds, he can teleport.
[54:04.49]And she just stepped in some dog shit right there.
[54:06.49]This slows you down by 25% Etalyx.
[54:08.11]That's why you've got to avoid dog shit.
[54:11.85]Rookie mistake.
[54:13.58]And then usually C9 Jackoff usually does really well with that.
[54:20.01]But not this time.
[54:22.75]We're strangely going over to the dock and walking.
[54:25.87]It seems like this...
[54:45.52]It's the most anticlimactic ending to that.
[54:49.04]Why did that happen?
[54:52.39]It looked like she was swimming, though.
[54:53.99]Yeah.
[54:54.65]It was a rookie mistake.
[54:56.81]Does she accept her fate?
[55:02.74]I don't know.
[55:08.06]She just dove in the water and then the game was over.
[55:10.70]I just unlocked Ramona Flowers from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World's Best Nerd Movie.
[55:19.20]Okay, did I... Who else do I want to try?
[55:21.50]18.
[55:22.86]I want somebody with a lot of strength.
[55:29.97]I want someone with infinite stamina so I can sprint.
[55:32.55]That too.
[55:34.07]That's why everyone's that girl.
[55:35.47]She has 9 out of 10.
[55:38.45]oh that's okay I get it yep nine out of ten stamina uh the jock at little eight ten out of ten speed so that's 10 out of 10 speed this is okay you're talking about why everybody picks this character this character's like broken I like the character you were this guy's like five out of five everywhere five out of ten everywhere let me try him
[56:04.46]I'm gonna be the girl with 10 out of 10 composure, so she doesn't get scared as much, I guess.
[56:08.12]But her speed is so low.
[56:09.52]Strength is 1.
[56:11.91]Somebody said, pay attention, you morons.
[56:14.41]Jason's game crashed.
[56:17.73]Did it?
[56:18.19]It said you died.
[56:18.95]It said we died, not we win.
[56:20.55]Wow.
[56:24.15]Wow, morons.
[56:25.07]I'm gonna try.
[56:25.53]How's it?
[56:27.55]How's this?
[56:29.97]Oh.
[56:30.11]This one's not better.
[56:31.85]Okay.
[56:36.29]oh yeah guys just ready up if we get a chance it's okay man by the way sorry I think I got a real bad cold so if I sound like up I'm sorry guys be quiet Jerma yeah sorry be quiet like you're bothering lobby sorry about that
[57:07.98]Are you pinching your nose to talk?
[57:10.18]Are you... I'm sorry that you're so sick.
[57:16.74]Why would you, like, turn on the mic to fucking do, like, the congested nose sound?
[57:21.45]Oh, I'm so sorry, guys.
[57:26.31]I can't even...
[57:34.44]Apparently you can swim, I guess.
[57:37.10]And apparently this game crashed.
[57:39.51]For all of us here at Red Nose Entertainment, I just want to say enjoy the game, guys.
[57:44.29]Have fun, and hopefully you guys like the new changes.
[57:47.85]Same to you.
[57:49.51]Is that guy actually a dev?
[57:51.71]No.
[57:52.23]He has a twitch.tv name.
[57:53.67]Oh.
[57:56.57]Red Nose.
[57:57.49]I'm going to change the company every time.
[57:59.93]Hey, what is Tidiv?
[58:10.66]Just keep changing the name of the company.
[58:18.06]Is that normally how these movies go?
[58:19.58]Like, they're just at a camp, and then he comes and murders one of them before the whole crew, and then they split up and run?
[58:25.11]Um... Kinda, yeah.
[58:27.81]Usually he just kills people.
[58:30.05]At a camp.
[58:32.01]Usually how it works.
[58:33.65]Yeah, but isn't there more suspense to it than that?
[58:35.96]He just walked in and just... Nice bat.
[58:38.00]Right off the bat.
[58:42.39]Okay, and a flare gun.
[58:48.87]Okay, what do you think is more useful?
[58:50.01]What are you talking about, homie?
[58:51.19]There's fucking weapons everywhere in here.
[58:52.87]There's like a cane.
[58:55.39]Shoot me.
[58:55.99]You won't.
[58:56.57]You won't.
[59:01.79]Guy has a flare.
[59:03.31]That's me.
[59:03.71]I have a flare.
[59:05.23]No, it's not you.
[59:05.83]It's another guy with a flare.
[59:06.95]Shit.
[59:08.73]Now I'm scared.
[59:15.05]I don't want the flare.
[59:16.33]What?
[59:17.59]Is this guy... God damn it.
[59:23.83]Mistakes were made here.
[59:25.43]Lots of mistakes were made here.
[59:26.45]I was trying to shoot it out there to make him think that people were, like, over there.
[59:29.07]I think you're supposed to shoot him in the face with it, actually.
[59:31.59]What?
[59:32.11]Oh, fuck.
[59:33.21]I think you're supposed to hit him in the face with the flare to get away.
[59:36.17]God damn it.
[59:36.73]Really?
[59:38.13]Yeah.
[59:38.89]I don't like being alone.
[59:41.19]Well, come over here.
[59:41.77]There's three of us together.
[59:44.93]We are all in the same location, which is, you know, obviously ideal.
[59:49.61]What are you close to?
[59:52.20]We are close to a car, a yellow house, something lodge.
[59:59.34]I'm like across the whole map from you guys.
[60:00.84]I hope I don't die.
[60:08.03]Alright.
[60:08.81]What do you do with the walkie talkie?
[60:11.11]Can't open this.
[60:13.71]I'm doing that already.
[60:15.53]What's the yellow building?
[60:17.88]Oh, he's here.
[60:20.52]Okay, I think I see what you got.
[60:21.72]I see the car.
[60:22.06]Alright, Elmari.
[60:23.58]You know what to do.
[60:28.24]You're gonna be my meat shield.
[60:30.55]Oh, shit.
[60:30.99]He's coming to me.
[60:31.57]Oh, no.
[60:31.93]No, no, no, no.
[60:32.69]Okay, I don't think he saw me.
[60:33.89]Yeah, he's coming to you guys right now.
[60:35.55]Yeah, he's definitely coming to us.
[60:38.86]Oh, they've got a car.
[60:40.00]Alright.
[60:41.54]Oh, God.
[60:42.08]Oh, God.
[60:42.40]Oh, God.
[60:43.56]So, we're going to bring him this way.
[60:47.64]Come on, Moria.
[60:47.98]Let's go.
[60:48.24]Alright.
[60:48.82]There's gas in the car.
[60:54.45]Is he in the house with you guys?
[60:57.47]It kind of sounds like it.
[60:59.17]I think he is.
[61:02.41]Can I... He's like opening the door.
[61:03.91]I see him.
[61:04.19]I see him.
[61:04.83]Oh, somebody has a gun.
[61:06.57]It's us.
[61:06.81]It was us.
[61:12.67]Anybody have a battery?
[61:31.18]I'm gonna die first.
[61:32.16]I don't want to be the one to die first.
[61:33.62]I'm gum running.
[61:37.16]I keep, like, stubbing my toe.
[61:38.70]Oh, I found the party.
[61:39.80]I found the crew.
[61:40.48]Yeah, come to us.
[61:43.48]What is this?
[61:44.57]He's coming, guys!
[61:45.51]Oh, I got a map!
[61:46.67]He's coming!
[61:48.49]Oh, he is coming!
[61:49.77]He is coming.
[61:50.67]You gotta help me.
[61:51.53]I'm low on stamina.
[61:51.97]What do you mean I can't?
[61:53.13]I can't.
[61:53.47]I can't.
[61:53.91]Alright.
[61:54.67]No, that means... Oh, go, go, go.
[61:56.09]You turn around now.
[61:56.59]You turn around.
[61:56.97]Turn around.
[61:58.29]You have to help me.
[61:59.72]I'm watching behind you.
[62:00.66]You're good.
[62:01.42]You're good for now.
[62:02.52]Just walk and get... Oh, he's still there.
[62:04.04]He's coming.
[62:04.32]He's still coming.
[62:05.08]He's still coming.
[62:05.52]I'm dead.
[62:05.98]I'm dead.
[62:06.28]I'm gonna die.
[62:09.75]I can't save you.
[62:10.51]Alright, Greg.
[62:12.44]Alright, you ready?
[62:12.88]We're going to stick together.
[62:13.92]I'm going to like really.
[62:14.82]Keep running this way.
[62:15.76]There's a house up here.
[62:16.58]He's going to teleport.
[62:17.06]There's a house up ahead.
[62:17.90]What is he picking up?
[62:19.50]Come to the house.
[62:22.93]He's picking up something on the ground.
[62:24.71]He's cutting through the woods.
[62:27.55]He's going to be cutting close.
[62:29.51]Get in.
[62:30.30]Get in.
[62:36.70]Close it.
[62:37.56]Nice.
[62:37.88]Good job.
[62:39.92]Easy, easy.
[62:41.56]I don't feel so good now.
[62:43.06]Oh, God.
[62:45.48]Keep going.
[62:46.12]Look at me running so shittily.
[62:48.31]Why are we running like this?
[62:52.19]Sorry.
[62:53.99]Is he in here with us?
[62:55.31]Why did you lock us in?
[62:56.55]You just locked us in with him.
[62:57.67]Oh.
[63:06.35]He's coming through the Kool-Aid!
[63:07.45]He's coming through the Kool-Aid, man!
[63:08.85]He's coming through the Kool-Aid, man!
[63:10.62]Go!
[63:10.94]Go!
[63:11.24]Go!
[63:11.48]I gotta go!
[63:11.88]Come on!
[63:15.88]Hurry!
[63:18.40]Aren't you glad I locked the door now?
[63:20.19]Aren't you glad I didn't say banana?
[63:22.81]Alright, get in.
[63:23.73]Okay.
[63:24.59]I'm trying.
[63:25.61]Shut it.
[63:26.65]Lock it.
[63:27.35]Lock it.
[63:28.09]Put it in your pocket.
[63:33.15]This is another Kool-Aid house.
[63:34.33]Let's just open all the doors.
[63:35.35]I was trying to take an apple.
[63:36.29]Come on, there's got to be something in here.
[63:41.14]Gun.
[63:41.56]Come on.
[63:41.86]Gun?
[63:42.24]No.
[63:48.32]Alright, I locked another one of the outside doors.
[63:50.30]Okay, I'm alright.
[63:51.02]I'm alright.
[63:51.76]Are you still in the building?
[63:53.14]I'm under the bed.
[63:57.44]I found first aid spray.
[63:59.31]He might be here still, man.
[64:04.87]He's, wherever he is, he's close.
[64:08.79]Are you are in this building with me?
[64:10.01]I'm in the building with you.
[64:10.77]I'm under the bed to top right where you are looking right now.
[64:13.49]I just heard the music.
[64:14.81]He's here somewhere.
[64:19.30]You're just like creeping around.
[64:21.14]I'm under the bed.
[64:23.46]Dude, he's here somewhere.
[64:27.00]Hang on, you're under this bed?
[64:27.96]I'm gonna go hide in the other bed.
[64:30.96]You're gonna go in the opposite bed?
[64:32.58]Yeah.
[64:33.04]Okay.
[64:36.40]Alright, just be quiet.
[64:40.81]How come you can only look in like a 30 degree arc?
[64:43.61]I don't know.
[64:44.05]That way.
[64:47.19]Yeah, this is pretty good survival strategy, I feel.
[64:51.75]I got healed up too, so I can run faster.
[64:53.53]Well, here's the thing.
[64:54.25]If one of us gets found by Jason, the other one can run.
[64:57.19]Yeah.
[64:58.57]so it's a it's a there's a guaranteed 50 chance of survival no matter what yep just you have a map right okay I do so open the map yeah and look for the like bridge at the top right or whatever wherever it is where the police come yeah and you got to figure out which way you need to go so you're talking about the lead us you're talking about the right like big road that goes all the way out to the right uh I think so it's like you can see where the map ends right yes
[65:26.32]I could guide us there so it should be somewhere like there's a bridge I think or something okay somebody used somebody called tommy jarvis uh that's the guy that comes back with the gun right everyone's still alive he hasn't killed anyone no he hasn't so like we could be here for a while because he could be chasing them bottom left somebody's saying
[65:57.56]Where is he?
[65:57.96]Shit.
[66:06.06]Is that by us?
[66:06.92]I don't know.
[66:08.20]Oh.
[66:08.82]I thought it was the way you reacted.
[66:12.11]Somebody else is in here with us.
[66:13.81]Hey, this is our house.
[66:15.21]Hold on.
[66:16.19]You're not allowed to be in our house.
[66:19.03]We're all under the beds.
[66:21.70]There's three people in here under three beds.
[66:24.01]There's not enough beds for everybody.
[66:27.25]I mean, the full pro strategy here, guys, is everybody gets under one of the beds in this room, and then when one person gets... Three out of four people will live.
[66:33.83]Yeah, three out of four people will live.
[66:35.27]We'll just roll the dice, and one of us will die, but at least some of us will get out.
[66:44.14]He's here.
[66:44.46]He's here.
[66:45.84]No, he's not.
[66:47.66]He's here.
[66:47.98]I was trying to scare everybody.
[66:51.95]I just saw him.
[66:52.37]I can smell him.
[66:54.95]No, he's actually here now.
[66:55.71]Hold your breath.
[66:56.15]Hold your breath.
[66:56.77]Everybody hold your breath.
[67:02.31]How come you can only hold your breath for five seconds?
[67:04.07]I can hear everybody just losing their breath.
[67:14.93]And I'm doing it again.
[67:33.70]I wonder where the survivors are We're filling this room with carbon dioxide, okay Heavy breathing
[67:56.87]Well, it looks like we're going to win.
[67:57.87]We got a minute.
[67:58.61]You want to start heading towards the police station?
[68:00.13]Let's start heading towards the police station now.
[68:03.45]What if he's just been waiting at the front door for all of us to come in?
[68:05.86]Jason!
[68:07.50]Alright, let's go.
[68:11.92]I got shot with a flare, too.
[68:13.70]Wait, why did they do that?
[68:15.01]I was just making a joke.
[68:16.85]Alright, we got to go this way.
[68:20.79]Bottom left, right?
[68:23.27]Let's try not to sprint.
[68:24.49]Let's just try to walk.
[68:27.01]I know it sucks.
[68:28.27]Isn't there no way to tell where it's going to be?
[68:29.97]It's going to be left or right, right?
[68:32.67]What is that?
[68:33.45]First aid spray?
[68:36.07]We got to conserve our... We're going the wrong way, by the way.
[68:38.76]Are we?
[68:39.64]Come this way.
[68:42.22]I think I just got healed.
[68:44.44]Make sure we don't run too much because we have to be able to run away.
[68:46.70]It's down here.
[68:50.94]That can actually kill somebody.
[68:52.14]Do we crouch at the same speed that we walk?
[68:55.28]I guess.
[68:56.88]So up here, we're gonna... There's already a guy waiting for the police over there.
[69:00.22]I wonder if that's gonna be the right spot.
[69:04.50]Yeah, don't run.
[69:06.48]Okay.
[69:07.42]I just heard it.
[69:07.78]Which way?
[69:09.88]Oh, it's to the right.
[69:10.82]This way.
[69:12.64]Oh, boy.
[69:13.10]Why can I not move?
[69:14.56]What is going on?
[69:15.06]Uh-oh.
[69:17.00]There's the music.
[69:17.56]This way.
[69:18.22]He's behind us.
[69:18.84]We gotta run.
[69:19.23]Go.
[69:19.55]Run.
[69:19.93]That's why we saved our energy.
[69:24.87]Where is he?
[69:26.81]Where is he?
[69:29.05]He's right to the left.
[69:29.74]He's right next door to the left.
[69:31.10]I'm going to sacrifice myself for the greater good.
[69:33.56]No.
[69:34.40]No.
[69:36.94]I'm running out of stamina.
[69:38.04]I'm tripping over rocks.
[69:41.38]Oh, God.
[69:41.76]I'm in trouble.
[69:42.56]Here we go.
[69:43.58]This is going to be for all the marbles.
[69:48.57]Why won't you fucking die?
[69:50.01]Go.
[69:50.25]Go.
[69:52.57]He's on the ground.
[69:53.37]I got him.
[69:55.15]Alright, I'm gonna regain my stamina.
[69:56.50]I'm gonna take this opportunity.
[70:00.12]He's getting up.
[70:00.70]He just moved.
[70:07.74]He's somewhere else now.
[70:09.60]He's right next to us.
[70:10.27]He's right next to us.
[70:12.55]Just get to the light.
[70:14.53]Yeah.
[70:19.49]We did it.
[70:20.15]We're gonna win.
[70:21.35]We're actually gonna win our third game.
[70:23.96]Wow.
[70:27.49]I kind of hoped that he would pick you off right before you got there.
[70:33.89]Thank you, police officers.
[70:36.42]Wait, who's doing that?
[70:38.58]Wait, what?
[70:39.94]Oh, is that the police?
[70:41.68]Oh.
[70:42.18]Oh, the police shoot him, apparently.
[70:49.26]No, he's back up.
[70:50.68]There's still like three people wandering around.
[70:52.60]Wait, what the fuck was that?
[70:56.45]Who shot him?
[70:58.43]I don't know where that gun sound came from.
[71:00.83]Well, somebody's Tommy Jarvis now.
[71:03.77]Oh, they are.
[71:05.81]It's our friend.
[71:06.35]I think this is the guy that escaped with us.
[71:10.75]And he's got a gun now.
[71:11.99]Call Jason.
[71:12.69]He's crying.
[71:13.31]The police shoot Jason if he gets too close?
[71:18.51]I guess.
[71:22.39]So is this guy hunting Jason?
[71:25.54]Because he's getting really close to him right now.
[71:27.94]I don't think that guy knew that Jason was behind him.
[71:31.46]No, I don't think he did.
[71:32.76]Quick, shoot him!
[71:38.80]Hold on.
[71:39.73]He got shot, though.
[71:41.05]He actually got shot right in the back.
[71:42.57]Look, all three of the other survivors have made it to the police simultaneously.
[71:45.67]How about that?
[71:46.25]That's it.
[71:49.55]That's it, right?
[71:49.89]Jason only murdered one person.
[71:51.55]He got one person.
[71:53.25]He neutered them, according to the game.
[71:57.28]Good game, everyone.
[71:58.04]Good game indeed.
[72:00.07]Alright, good game, mate.
[72:01.61]Can everybody hear it?
[72:04.53]That's my good boy.
[72:07.21]Wait, why are we getting this ending?
[72:10.23]Why are we not getting, like, the... Why are we not getting the good boys?
[72:12.91]He only gets one person and he still thinks he won?
[72:19.71]I don't know, that's dumb.
[72:25.17]Someone's microphone.
[72:27.19]Somebody has like their microphone on not push to talk and they're like talking to their dad right now.
[72:33.05]What do you want for dinner?
[72:39.17]This always like freaks me out because I always feel like I'm going to hear something fucking horrible.
[72:44.01]Like all of a sudden you hear like a smash, like a glass break and it's like, it's like, oh no, now I'm like an accomplice.
[72:49.97]Now I need to know what happened.
[72:52.93]Kind of stick around and, like, report the crime.
[72:55.31]All of a sudden, like, somebody, like, you hear, like, a smash.
[72:57.93]Like, this is a burglary.
[73:00.34]I can't wait to steal all your shit, Jennifer.
[73:02.84]And it's like, goddammit.
[73:03.68]This is a burglary.
[73:04.68]And it's like, I can't wait to.
[73:06.44]Announcing the crime.
[73:07.28]Yeah, you open up, he opens up the door and, like, it gets picked up on the mic.
[73:10.94]Like, this is a burglary and it's also gonna be a murder.
[73:14.74]And it's like, goddammit, I just heard him say that.
[73:17.13]So, like, now I, like, I have to, I have to be, like, I gotta go to court for this.

[73:54.81]I guess that we unlocked this guy and now we're him.
[73:58.30]I think we had him... I think I was him for the first game.
[74:02.26]All the viewers have to go to court, too.
[74:03.82]Like, we all have to go.
[74:04.66]Yeah, everyone has to go to court.
[74:08.05]There's 23, 2500 people on the witness stand.
[74:12.91]They just shove everybody in a court.
[74:14.13]They just rent out a stadium to do the trial.
[74:17.51]Yeah, we're going to have to do the trial of Jake Stevenson versus Jennifer Arthur in Fenway Park because we need like 5,000 people.
[74:27.09]You have to imagine that a piece like 50 of those people would not keep the story straight.
[74:40.54]You know, like, alright, so we're all in agreement here that everyone heard this man announce that he intended to murder and steal from these people.
[74:47.37]And there's, like, at least a hundred people that say, no, no.
[74:49.81]Like, I was at the bathroom, I don't know.
[74:51.97]Can you imagine trying to get, like, 2,500 Twitch chatters to, like, be on the same page?
[74:58.43]Gun.
[75:00.60]Uh, guy, I just want to let you know, gun.
[75:05.08]I have a rifle.
[75:08.60]You know, like, there'd be a bunch of people in Twitch chat that would just, like, just be, like, memeing in the jury.
[75:15.08]Yeah, they just live stream the court case.
[75:16.88]Because you have to get... It has to be unanimous.
[75:19.04]It's not just like, oh, yeah, you know, there's ten of us on the jury and nine of us said it, so he's guilty.
[75:23.60]No, no.
[75:24.08]You've got to convince 2,400 people to say yes.
[75:33.37]You guys like my strategy?
[75:34.27]Alright, where are you?
[75:36.19]What's your strategy?
[75:38.31]My strat is hold aim down sights in the closet, and if he opens, shoot him in the face.
[75:43.39]With a what?
[75:43.97]Flare gun?
[75:44.43]Uh, I'm in the yellow house.
[75:48.49]Okay.
[75:48.97]We're going through all the little, uh, tiny cabins.
[75:54.68]I think I'm okay.
[76:02.72]Got a bear trap?
[76:05.94]I hate when there's nothing in it.
[76:06.86]Found a map.
[76:07.26]Come on.
[76:10.36]Oops.
[76:11.04]That's how you hide in a closet.
[76:14.90]God damn it.
[76:22.12]Okay, well now I need help.
[76:23.81]Now I need help.
[76:27.05]I thought I dug.
[76:27.83]I was like... I fell out of the fucking second story window because I thought I was going to climb up.
[76:37.29]I didn't think that you actually just fell out.
[76:39.91]I thought you, like, could fall.
[76:44.78]Uh, maybe there'll be health in here.
[76:47.32]Get in, please.
[76:50.32]It's alright, I still have the gun.
[76:54.18]Got the car keys.
[77:05.94]You have a healing potion.
[77:07.62]Do you think it's a bit strange that all these log cabins have, like, wooden barricades attached to them?
[77:17.19]What's up with that?
[77:18.81]Oh my god, come on.
[77:21.83]What- I had a gun, too.
[77:24.84]I had a gun.
[77:25.24]That would've been so fun.
[77:29.34]I don't feel like playing anymore.
[77:31.76]And I will not quit the match.
[77:33.08]Dude, okay, if you're Jason, like, a prompt should pop up in the very fucking beginning of the match that says... Like, will you quit if you are Jason?
[77:40.69]Yeah, like, excuse me, sir or madam, do you have anything you need to do within the next five minutes?
[77:46.17]Yes or no?
[77:47.35]Like, are you going to need to get called to dinner?
[77:50.39]You should just be like, I don't want to be Jason then.
[77:53.91]Because losing one random fucking survivor is different than ending the game.
[77:56.74]He hasn't killed anyone.
[77:59.96]Probably if they just don't kill someone by a certain timestamp, they just quit because it's unwinnable.
[78:06.97]You think so?
[78:09.33]I don't know.
[78:09.63]That's my guess.
[78:10.35]I'm out of the game, so I'm going to have to join off of you again.
[78:14.39]Yeah, let's do that.
[78:17.30]So let me know when you're in a lobby, and then I will do it the old-fashioned way.
[78:21.24]I am currently searching for a game.
[78:25.84]You can do, like, spawn preference, too.
[78:27.44]Roll perk.
[78:28.52]Do you want to do, like, one private match where we're Jason?
[78:32.44]Or no?
[78:33.54]I gotta leave this.
[78:35.02]There's too many people in there.
[78:37.33]Just to see what it, like, looks like?
[78:41.51]We'll do a couple more and find that out.
[78:43.11]Let's see.
[78:44.21]You know you can roll perks and shit, right?
[78:45.77]Uh, yeah.
[78:49.30]But you have to pay limited resources to do that, right?
[78:53.15]Okay, I just got Grinder.
[78:54.27]Increase the amount of XP gained while equipped.
[79:00.87]Faster police arrival speed.
[79:05.24]Are you selecting a perk for that individual person or is it for anybody?
[79:08.16]I'm not sure.
[79:10.66]Weapon durability increased.
[79:11.96]You can sell perks.
[79:16.15]Wait, what was that?
[79:19.24]Reduces fear penalties from darkness.
[79:22.88]So this is just for her.
[79:23.88]Okay.
[79:24.28]Yeah.
[79:28.26]Okay.
[79:28.92]I got a good one.
[79:30.64]I want one for, like, this guy.
[79:36.16]Yeah.
[79:36.50]I don't know who to main.
[79:39.06]Who are you going to main?
[79:39.88]I guess it could be for everybody.
[79:44.17]It can't be for everyone.
[79:45.87]Yeah.
[79:47.03]Okay.
[79:47.37]That's cool.
[79:55.00]Increased weapon durability.
[79:57.90]That's cool.
[79:58.45]Seems awful.
[80:00.33]Sorry, the negative is you lose 3% chance to stun with it.
[80:04.35]I don't know.
[80:05.61]I'm doing quick play again.
[80:07.17]Join off me in like... I'll try to get you.
[80:11.85]I got a green shirt now.
[80:14.99]That's a big deal.
[80:18.26]No, this game is full.
[80:25.31]Trying it again.
[80:27.71]Can set spawn preference too.
[80:31.36]Ooh, that's good.
[80:34.26]Oh, wait a minute.
[80:35.38]You can set spawn preferences Jason.
[80:39.92]This one's fucking full too.
[80:40.92]God damn.
[80:50.43]Yeah, like I see that some of the characters are about stealth, but I don't know how to be stealthy.
[80:56.06]Like, I know you can push the crouch button.
[80:59.48]But that doesn't really tell me anything.
[81:03.38]Um... Alright, join with me.
[81:05.10]Quick, quick, quick.
[81:05.62]Join with me.
[81:07.49]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[81:11.49]Join.
[81:11.77]Alright.
[81:12.25]Connecting?
[81:12.79]Yay.
[81:14.11]Okay, cool.
[81:16.65]I set my spawn preference as Jason, just to see what happens.
[81:19.53]Yeah, the party system is, in fact, bugged at the moment.
[81:25.16]Unfortunately.
[81:27.01]Are you telling that to chat or to somebody else in the game?
[81:29.23]Chat.
[81:32.49]Yeah, it is pretty broken.
[81:38.02]This is a much more reliable way.
[81:42.50]Yep.
[81:52.08]Don't I want to be Jason?
[81:53.49]I do want to be Jason.
[81:54.59]You have to equip the perks.
[81:55.85]I did, didn't I?
[81:57.62]I didn't equip any Jason perks, so hopefully that doesn't matter too much.
[82:04.32]Why don't you form a party?
[82:05.31]Because the party system does not work.
[82:08.11]We tried it for like 10 straight minutes, and we cannot join as a party.
[82:11.83]It's bugged for some reason.
[82:15.90]Wait, am I getting this screen because I'm going to be Jason?
[82:19.74]Yo, trust me, it's gonna be me, boys.
[82:21.06]It's gonna be me, dude.
[82:22.32]I swear it.
[82:23.79]This is, like, my first match playing, so I'm kind of, like, okay at this.
[82:30.63]It's okay.
[82:30.91]Just be a pussy like me.
[82:32.21]Oh, my God.
[82:33.79]Well, I mean, I know how to play.
[82:35.17]Like, I know, like, the basics of this.
[82:36.63]Like, I don't... I have no idea.
[82:39.67]I got the marshmallows, boys.
[82:40.39]I got the marshmallows, boys.
[82:43.43]Ah!
[82:44.11]Ah!
[82:44.71]Ah!
[82:45.93]Okay.
[82:47.65]Okay.
[82:50.32]Alright.
[82:51.06]Are you him?
[82:51.86]I'm not Jason.
[82:53.22]What the fuck is happening?
[82:59.93]I'm on the beach.
[83:00.39]Hopefully Jason doesn't leave.
[83:01.49]Hopefully Jason doesn't have to get yelled at to come upstairs for dinner.
[83:14.39]Nothing in here.
[83:15.13]You're on the beach?
[83:23.66]Jason, it's time for dinner.
[83:26.50]Really?
[83:32.38]I think he's in the microwave.
[83:36.29]I want to drive the car.
[83:39.99]That would be so much fun to drive that car around.
[83:41.67]I think it's really janky, but it would be fun just because of that reason alone.
[83:52.06]I'm definitely taking a bat.
[84:00.46]I'm going to take the flare.
[84:03.47]You said right in the face, right?
[84:04.45]For the flare?
[84:04.81]Should I take the javelins?
[84:08.07]No, that's just a folding chair.
[84:09.21]Never mind.
[84:11.69]Ooh, what's that?
[84:13.45]Wait, alright.
[84:13.85]There's three of us together.
[84:15.73]Three of us together right now.
[84:19.49]Phone box views?
[84:20.89]Are you by yourself or are you near someone else?
[84:22.75]I'm by myself.
[84:25.13]Okay.
[84:26.83]I just found a phone box fuse.
[84:28.19]I guess I can call the police.
[84:30.29]These guys are gonna die.
[84:31.95]We are gonna die as these guys.
[84:36.58]First aid spray.
[84:40.38]Why do I hear that music?
[84:41.18]Hey, you play your game.
[84:42.80]I'll play my game, buddy.
[84:44.28]You can make it out without me.
[84:45.62]I don't know how to play correctly, so yeah.
[84:48.88]I'm freaking out right now.
[84:50.60]Is he by you guys?
[84:51.63]Hey, you know what makes a
[84:53.89]What the?
[84:54.29]Hey, you said he was near you.
[84:56.37]You said he was near you guys.
[84:57.69]Alright, flare, flare.
[84:59.45]Got him.
[85:01.45]Oh, he's like right there, isn't he?
[85:02.75]Got him.
[85:04.67]You said he was near the yellow house.
[85:06.54]I mean, you're pretty close to the yellow house.
[85:08.20]Am I?
[85:09.52]Yeah.
[85:10.70]Okay, okay.
[85:13.54]Get in the tent.
[85:25.20]You're in the tent right now.
[85:26.52]Okay.
[85:29.05]Just don't have to double check to make sure I heard that correctly.
[85:32.33]I lost him.
[85:37.97]Ladies and gentlemen, this is how you effectively play against Jason.
[85:45.00]I'm coming to you guys.
[85:46.90]I am beyond those guys.
[85:47.96]I'm to your right, I think.
[85:49.74]I'm the guy that's just standing still in the house.
[85:51.60]Okay, I'm going to come in the house.
[85:53.34]Is there anything in there?
[85:55.04]No, I've just been hiding.
[85:57.33]There is a battery.
[85:58.89]Really?
[85:59.69]I got a car battery.
[86:00.81]I need you to open the door.
[86:05.61]Hey, Greg.
[86:08.61]Hey.
[86:12.87]Oh, yep.
[86:13.35]Okay.
[86:13.95]Let's put that in the car.
[86:14.97]Guard me.
[86:15.39]I'm going to put this in the car.
[86:16.31]Yep.
[86:16.57]I will protect you.
[86:17.75]I think we're not supposed to run.
[86:18.93]I will protect you with the tree trunk.
[86:21.21]I have first aid spray, too.
[86:22.17]Whatever.
[86:22.47]She's running.
[86:23.37]The more of us that are together, the more noise we make to him.
[86:25.96]And every single person in the game is here.
[86:27.86]Is there a phone in that car?
[86:28.84]Oh, do you want me to put it in?
[86:29.80]I have higher intelligence.
[86:31.72]Oh, okay.
[86:33.12]Is there a phone in that car?
[86:34.18]I got a phone battery.
[86:36.28]Oh, God.
[86:36.88]We need gas.
[86:37.26]We need gas.
[86:37.80]We need gas.
[86:38.30]We're going to have to fight for this car at the end.
[86:41.70]There's only four seats.
[86:43.71]Alright, where's the gas?
[86:44.37]Somebody get that gas.
[86:45.17]Alright, batteries go.
[86:51.05]Shotgun.
[86:55.06]Did somebody shoot a gun?
[86:56.82]No, someone just hit the car.
[86:58.42]Why are we all just standing here?
[87:00.38]Why are we all like cockroaches right now?
[87:02.14]Let's split up.
[87:03.24]Dude, if you split up in the movies, you die.
[87:10.33]Alright, what do we do?
[87:10.81]I saw gas, too.
[87:12.26]You saw gas?
[87:13.18]Well, which way did you come from?
[87:14.44]It's not there.
[87:14.96]Someone's already been there.
[87:15.94]Alright, I'm going this way.
[87:20.66]I'm not going to run anymore.
[87:23.48]We should probably run.
[87:24.60]Just run from place to place.
[87:25.99]Like, run from one house to the next.
[87:27.93]Have you been in here yet?
[87:29.99]I have not, but somebody has.
[87:31.39]Let's see if there's gas in here.
[87:32.29]Alright, I'm going to the next house.
[87:34.41]I do not see gasoline in here.
[87:39.26]probably gonna be in like the barn or there is a wrench why can I not pick this up can't carry that I guess okay nothing in here uh somebody's screaming in that direction somebody's oh yep alright so note yourself don't go that way um

[88:11.42]Someone just... Trying to find out how to get out of here.
[88:14.73]How do you get in?
[88:15.91]I don't know.
[88:16.93]Look.
[88:18.27]There's a window right next to you.
[88:21.25]No, I'm fine.
[88:25.19]I'm checking this house back here.
[88:26.49]You went in all these houses already?
[88:28.26]Yeah, I think all these houses are done.
[88:31.28]And there's no gas.
[88:32.87]And Jason is the direction that we're running, so... Well, then he's not going to expect us.
[88:38.43]What about this one?
[88:40.40]Why would he expect the players to run towards him?
[88:43.32]And it's been broken into.
[88:44.68]He's not in here anymore.
[88:46.10]Why would he still be in here?
[88:47.14]He won't come back.
[88:49.72]All you need to know is we need to find gas.
[88:54.60]Um... Jerma?

[91:40.81]Also, thank you to William Kangaroo for the two bucks.
[91:42.63]I was gonna wait till I had 500 from ads, but after six months of Twitch not wanting me to watch ads for some reason, I decided to give it, you know.
[91:50.02]Well, thank you, William.
[91:52.84]And Dr. Porpoise.
[91:53.88]$500 from ads is a lot.

[92:00.22]And Dr. Porpoise, also thank you for the bits.
[92:04.93]Dab stab, I'm Jason the Crab.
[92:06.57]I didn't kill anyone, so I'm mad.
[92:09.05]Now I'll leave the game like a jerk, but since I don't care, I'll just sit there and smirk.
[92:15.20]420 XD, 69 lead.
[92:16.54]Well, that's great.
[92:21.46]I thought that person had my name.
[92:23.77]I thought that was Jerma985, but it's Jamon83985.
[92:26.07]Okay, doesn't that look like a hacked version of my name?
[92:32.23]Are we ready to die?
[92:34.81]And he's like creepy like me too.
[92:35.95]If you're Jason and you leave this game, I will find you and I will kill you.
[92:42.21]In real life.
[92:42.55]Whoa!
[92:42.75]Jermone and Jerma.
[93:04.76]Jamon and Pumbaa.
[93:05.76]Jamon and Jerma.
[93:07.48]I was about to do the same thing.
[93:10.24]Hakuna Matata.
[93:14.82]Jamon and Jerma.
[93:19.26]I better be Jason.
[93:20.12]I better be Jason.
[93:21.46]I better be Jason.
[93:24.77]Hey, can I just take a moment to say thank you to Fox and Fury for the...
[93:37.09]I just want to say, guys, from all of us here at Silly Straw Entertainment, thanks for downloading the game, and have a ton of fun.
[93:44.41]At Silly Straw?
[93:45.70]Silly Straw Entertainment.
[93:47.46]Oh.
[93:51.38]Alright, I'm on the side of the map all by myself.
[93:54.04]Is this like an archer?
[93:54.80]Is it like a bow and arrow?
[94:01.93]And by the way, if you have any questions or concerns about bugs, email me personally.
[94:05.77]My name is Ted.
[94:06.41]That's Ted at SillyStrawGames.com.
[94:17.62]My voice is low.
[94:18.56]I'm just talking to nobody.
[94:20.96]Oh, god damn it.
[94:23.89]Has he already found you?
[94:25.25]Nobody can even hear me.
[94:28.74]You're muted?
[94:30.08]It's like local only.
[94:32.28]Oh.
[94:34.40]Oops.
[94:35.12]Shit.
[94:39.20]The name is Greg.
[94:40.42]Oh yeah, it's Ted.
[94:43.36]Email me at Ted.
[94:47.48]Okay, please close the window.
[94:48.74]There's like a ton of stuff in here.
[94:50.08]Oh my god, close the window.
[94:58.16]Oh, this is how you summon the guy.
[95:00.99]I figured out how to summon the guy with the shotgun.
[95:03.05]So I'm going to wait until someone dies.
[95:05.19]Nice gun.
[95:07.21]Exactly what I wanted.
[95:07.99]Alright, so on the map, that's top right by Birch Ridge.
[95:13.85]I think this has one shot.
[95:17.02]Ted Greggins.
[95:20.04]Yeah, my name's Ted.
[95:21.02]Please email me at tedgreggins at silliestrawentertainment.org.
[95:28.34]I will personally answer every email.
[95:30.74]Because I'm like that.
[95:34.28]We're one of those companies that really wants to put a step forward in customer communication.
[95:43.77]No, I think... Oh, you do it now so that when someone dies, they come back?
[95:48.45]Is that how that works?
[95:49.55]Oh, that's my bad.
[95:51.15]Whoops.
[95:54.33]Why... I hate my life right now.
[95:57.66]He'd be very dumb to come at me.
[95:59.40]I have the rifle.
[96:05.16]You don't come at the guy with the rifle.
[96:07.68]That would be a mistake.
[96:09.94]I will plant this directly between your eyes.
[96:11.76]Okay, I'm gonna go back and do it.
[96:17.26]That voice is so annoying and so smug.
[96:21.90]Well, I found the gas canister.
[96:24.26]He's, um... He's up by somebody.
[96:29.49]Probably over by me.
[96:30.61]He's turning his brake.
[96:31.23]He's currently breaking down the door.
[96:32.79]Oh, you might want to run.
[96:33.61]Oh, wait.
[96:34.73]It's alright.
[96:34.99]I got a gun here.
[96:35.79]Whoops.
[96:37.20]My bad.
[96:37.72]Alright, I guess I'll stop the guy now.
[96:52.15]Get up there.
[96:52.75]Alright.
[96:53.65]We called Tommy Jarvis.
[96:55.73]Good.
[96:56.37]Get Jarvis in here.
[96:57.36]Die on purpose and then become Tommy Jarvis.
[97:01.34]Well, it's probably going to happen because I can't come on.
[97:09.73]We're good.
[97:11.69]I mean, I did shoot him.
[97:14.57]He did get knocked down from that.
[97:19.12]I'm gonna come back as Tommy Jarvis just to have the gun again.
[97:54.95]Let's go.
[97:56.69]What?
[97:57.51]Alright.
[97:59.31]Dermot, come to me.
[98:00.15]I'm coming.
[98:01.19]Go to the northeast part of the map.
[98:03.09]Northeast part.
[98:03.95]I'm currently not.
[98:04.49]We're about to fix a boat.
[98:05.69]Okay.
[98:06.05]Oh, my God.
[98:06.33]Are you going to get a boat?
[98:07.23]He's here.
[98:07.51]I'm coming.
[98:09.97]Are you in the bathroom?
[98:11.21]Someone's dying.
[98:13.19]I'm coming as fast as I can.
[98:14.68]Oh, no.
[98:17.18]Got to get back in.
[98:20.52]He's dead.
[98:21.68]The guy that was going to help me fix the boat's dead.
[98:24.36]Well, I'm at the bathroom.
[98:25.96]How far away is the bathroom from you?
[98:27.26]You know what to do.
[98:30.18]Bathroom?
[98:30.74]I don't know.
[98:31.06]We're at the easternmost house.
[98:33.83]What?
[98:34.53]What was that?
[98:35.27]Holy shit.
[98:36.31]Is that a dead body?
[98:37.35]You're just concerned about a dead body.
[98:40.95]Okay.
[98:43.93]Did you have anything?
[98:45.49]No, I didn't have anything.
[98:46.35]Oh my goodness.
[98:48.59]Oh my goodness.
[98:49.15]So you're east?
[98:53.05]Hold on.
[98:54.13]This is very scary right now, Jerma.
[98:56.65]I'm coming.
[98:58.25]He's right here.
[98:58.97]There's a person running away, and he's here with three of us.
[99:03.05]Connor is... Keep spamming.
[99:09.47]You're at the eastern most house.
[99:10.69]How close are you to the boat?
[99:19.20]It's like my own personal nightmare.
[99:24.12]Oh, I can see you.
[99:24.74]I can see.
[99:25.74]I don't know what's going on.
[99:27.48]I stepped in my own bear trap.
[99:30.64]The same one that I set up earlier.
[99:32.46]I stepped in it.
[99:33.10]Why didn't he step in it?
[99:35.40]He went through the door.
[99:36.62]Just coming for a brisk jog through the woods.
[99:42.25]Is that you?
[99:43.33]I'm outside saying, help me, please.
[99:45.51]Okay, but Boo Boo has like... It's alright, I got a bat.
[99:51.71]I'm dead.
[99:52.29]I'm gonna die.
[99:53.87]Is there gas in that car?
[99:57.91]Oh, baby.
[99:58.89]We're about to find out.
[100:05.46]X to jog?
[100:06.00]That's what I'm doing.
[100:08.80]I literally am jogging right now.
[100:19.63]Good luck.
[100:19.97]He's dead.
[100:25.77]This is... this is pretty lame, okay?
[100:28.05]Like... Oh, shit.
[100:31.51]Etalyx, where are you?
[100:33.87]Etalyx, where are you?
[100:35.77]Etalyx, where are you?
[101:02.39]Holy shit, somebody's in the boat.
[101:07.71]Okay, what's going on?
[101:09.13]Do I get to come back as Tommy Jarvis now?
[101:11.18]No, someone already did.
[101:12.12]God damn it.
[101:12.66]I'm dead too, though.
[101:16.18]Somebody's in a boat, which is what I was trying to do.
[101:18.86]This person's just driving around in a boat.
[101:26.11]They can escape in the boat, so they're probably trying to pick up more people.
[101:31.91]You know, do you want to know how I died?
[101:33.07]How?
[101:34.53]Okay, so I was in this house.
[101:35.67]Did you see this guy just leap through the window into him?
[101:40.77]Oh, what a really great Tommy Jarvis, by the way.
[101:46.13]That was me.
[101:48.65]Right through the face.
[101:51.49]Anyway, so I set up a bear trap.
[101:54.36]Unbeknownst to me,
[101:56.56]Jason hacked down the door saw the bear trap and then teleported past the bear trap so that when I tried to escape the house I ran into my own bear trap and then died uh go can you look at boo boo right now the tommy jarvis guy I mean I I saw him die do you see him floating he's like floating and hanging out hey flip back and forth dramatically from the purse from zay to the boat
[102:26.51]And listen to how the music goes like dun dun dun dun dun dun and then it's just quiet person like in a fishing boat.
[102:33.16]Yeah.
[102:35.66]Actually, if you go from the boat, it's funny watching them scramble towards.
[102:39.22]Can he go in the water?
[102:41.73]I don't know.
[102:42.55]I guess he can.
[102:44.99]Do you realize he's like under the boat right now?
[102:53.15]Wait.
[102:53.59]He's drowning her.
[102:57.33]What is what why was he just a shark?
[103:00.47]Throwing knives at her now
[103:17.19]There's a knife in her cap.
[103:25.18]I don't know what the end game is here.
[103:26.48]Oh, in the thigh.
[103:29.78]Oh, no.
[103:30.32]That's going to work.
[103:33.92]Aw.
[103:34.50]Wow, she karate kicked him off.
[103:37.46]And the daggers are gone.
[103:38.46]No more injury.
[103:40.85]She's trying to get in the boat again.
[103:42.35]Oh, third time in the boat.
[103:44.93]Will it work for her this time?
[103:47.19]The boat's not gonna work, he's about to jaws you!
[103:49.88]See, he's like... How does he teleport under the boat, though?
[103:58.86]He must just be teleporting in the water.
[104:02.38]She's going for it a fourth time now, ladies and gentlemen.
[104:05.07]Here he comes once again.
[104:06.39]Here he goes, he's gonna grab the boat.
[104:09.15]Hey, no, excuse me, you can't do that.
[104:11.51]And she's dead.
[104:11.95]Now she's stuck, apparently, inside of the pier.
[104:20.68]Well, she tried.
[104:22.48]Oh, that was so dumb.
[104:26.76]I love it.
[104:28.04]See, you thought Jason was a land predator.
[104:30.36]No, he's actually protecting the lake.
[104:35.45]He prowls the water.
[104:44.17]Can one of us be Jason now?
[104:45.27]I want to be Jason.
[104:48.29]Yeah, I'd like to be Jason.
[104:51.09]killed 8 out of 8 what a pro Jason is not AI controlled what did he what did he just say I don't know I thought I had him I thought he said you guys were bad to be honest what the heck and then he left why is he so mean I don't know you can choose on private room so private room we have to like add people on Steam for that don't we
[105:23.79]uh yes you can't just like invite people like Steam names right you either have to invite people or have a public profile where people can join off your profile yeah I don't I do I have that I guess I know my profile is private and I have so and like here's the thing with like Steam and Valve they never made it so
[105:47.54]They never made it so you could just not accept friend requests.
[105:52.62]You just have pending friend requests, like hundreds of them.
[105:55.68]So because I have so many pending friend requests, I have too many pending friend requests.
[105:59.88]So I can't add any people.
[106:02.78]I have like 40 friends.
[106:04.58]I have like 35 friends on Steam.
[106:07.13]I can't add anymore because I'm not allowed to because I have too many pending friend requests.
[106:10.67]I have like fucking hundreds of them.
[106:13.73]Yeah, I do also.
[106:17.60]Ignore them all?
[106:19.24]I have to sit there and like click the button.
[106:25.02]I have to click ignore like 900 times.
[106:27.18]Like I don't want to sit there and do that.
[106:36.97]There's an ignore all button?
[106:38.25]Are you serious?
[106:52.13]Too lazy to press one button.
[106:57.34]Jerma, let me log into your account and I'll delete them for you.
[107:00.10]Thanks, man.
[107:01.12]Yeah, my account name is FrenchFryFrog112222112 and the password is fuck.
[107:25.86]Decent idea might be like Steam group.
[107:28.54]I got to get out of here now.
[107:33.01]If you really want it to.
[107:37.99]Hello.
[107:38.45]Am I muted?
[107:39.27]Done.
[107:39.61]Done.
[107:39.89]Done.
[107:51.15]I mean, he's instantly here.
[107:53.67]Like, that's... That's great.
[107:55.33]I'm gonna instantly lose.
[108:03.22]I better not instantly lose.
[108:06.12]That'd be so bad.
[108:06.94]Alright, Zee.
[108:20.87]He's down by the car.
[108:28.01]I got battery and a car key.
[108:34.25]I got battery and a car key.
[108:37.57]Just need some gas.
[108:38.51]Yeah, just need gas.
[108:47.60]Oh, shit.
[108:48.12]He has gas, but he's being chased.
[108:50.95]Uh, what do we do?
[108:52.09]What do we do in this situation?
[108:52.87]What do we do?
[108:53.35]Hit him?
[108:55.13]No, no, no, no.
[108:55.67]I don't know anything.
[108:57.29]I'm so stupid.
[108:57.73]Please help me.
[109:04.60]This gas is gonna be right next to the car.
[109:18.73]Sorry, I had to mute for a second.
[109:22.40]I had to take care of some... It was me.
[109:27.20]It was me the whole time.
[109:28.64]Oh no.
[109:32.60]Also, I am flying germinal.
[109:35.76]Shit!
[109:36.06]I bugged the game.
[109:37.60]What'd you do?
[109:37.94]I bugged the game.
[109:41.34]I'm floating.
[109:44.81]I am... What is... I'm gonna get banned from the game.
[109:47.95]Like, Easy Seed is going to ban me.
[109:50.17]You're getting captured right now.
[109:51.99]I'm dead.
[109:54.99]I'm ice skating right now.
[109:57.39]What does this look like to you?
[109:58.56]Let's find out.
[110:05.12]I am hacking the game.
[110:06.20]I think he's outside my house.
[110:07.40]Wait, no, it's fine now.
[110:08.32]I messed it up.
[110:15.19]What happened to you?
[110:17.95]I was with a guy with a car battery, and there was a guy with gas next to the car.
[110:21.25]He killed that guy, and I didn't think he was gonna... He came right over to me.
[110:24.71]I didn't think he saw me.
[110:26.77]And I tried to dodge him, and he just teleported on me and killed me.
[110:34.70]What's the plan right now?
[110:36.68]I mean, the plan... The plan is... Oh, he's here.
[110:39.74]...is die.
[110:42.83]He's here.
[110:46.42]Oh, you're in deep shit.
[110:48.02]Yeah, I am.
[110:48.98]I don't even know where anyone is.
[110:53.02]He can't go in through that, right?
[110:54.72]I don't think so.
[110:56.28]I wouldn't stop to see.
[110:57.26]I would probably keep moving.
[110:59.04]Okay, my game is glitched.
[111:17.97]Oh, you're in trouble.
[111:21.51]Good.
[111:21.97]Good job.
[111:22.39]Alright.
[111:22.88]He's coming to get you.
[111:24.62]Yeah, but he's stuck in here, right?
[111:25.70]Unless he goes all the way back around.
[111:27.22]Yeah, he's stuck in here.
[111:30.48]And I've got full stamina right now.
[111:32.58]You're going to drink a blimberry potion, dude.
[111:34.08]Alright.
[111:37.90]We're going in here with Boo-Boo.
[111:46.36]Is there anywhere to hide in here?
[111:47.38]There is.
[111:49.08]Somebody's got a car.
[111:50.70]Hold on.
[111:51.62]I'm doing something very important.
[111:54.12]This guy's just in the car by himself.
[111:57.08]He'd rather have, like, a bunch of snacks in the backseat than pick you guys up.
[112:01.47]This guy has a giant... Wait, he's just going by?
[112:02.93]He's got a giant thing of oatmeal.
[112:05.59]Oatmeal briskets in the backseat.
[112:08.75]Hang on.
[112:09.73]We're coming.
[112:10.81]Let me in.
[112:12.53]There's no room.
[112:13.15]There's no room.
[112:21.14]He's still trying to drive the car.
[112:22.72]He actually can drive it.
[112:24.18]Gotta have my snacks.
[112:25.66]He like disappeared.
[112:38.37]Yeah, sorry guys, it's normal.
[112:39.99]I'm moving into college next week and I need to bring my snacks and tools.
[112:44.43]Where are you going?
[112:49.27]We got left behind, say.
[112:50.93]I think this guy's gonna make it out of here.
[112:57.13]What?
[112:58.99]What?
[113:00.17]What the fuck was that?
[113:01.25]He just appeared on the car.
[113:08.86]While it was driving?
[113:09.72]Yeah.
[113:12.84]Okay.
[113:14.22]He got away.
[113:15.95]Really?
[113:16.23]Yeah.
[113:20.95]Yeah, he got away.
[113:21.49]This other guy that I'm with is talking my ear off, but I cannot hear a word he's saying.
[113:26.91]He's so quiet.
[113:27.41]He has not let go of the push talk button the whole time.
[113:29.63]Just strategizing.
[113:34.90]Hold on.
[113:50.19]It's down to just the three of you.
[113:57.49]I think the car might still work.
[114:02.43]It's possible.
[114:05.10]Well, we're getting pretty close to it.
[114:06.88]I do have keys, just in case the guy left with keys.
[114:09.28]Yeah, you're going to have to get in the driver's seat.
[114:11.26]We're in England.
[114:14.88]Are we locking the door?
[114:17.92]What's going on?
[114:18.36]Is he guarding the car?
[114:20.90]The car's right outside.
[114:21.80]Yeah, I know, but the music is crazy right now.
[114:24.82]Boo Boo's coming in here.
[114:28.18]Oh, he's like outside the house.
[114:33.98]Wrong door.
[114:35.19]Must not work.
[114:38.85]Steering wheel's not in front of me.
[114:40.45]Car doesn't work.
[114:43.05]Who's getting killed?
[114:46.14]nobody you guys are all what is all the noise I think he's just breaking what just exploded there's a bear trap right here so we can't go out that door for sure he's around he's near the house yeah he's obviously very near the house he broke the fuse box wait who just left why does it say
[115:14.90]Oh, probably one of the survivors.
[115:19.01]Does he know we're all in here?
[115:20.39]He's raiding the fridge.
[115:25.23]I just saw him walk by.
[115:26.66]Uh oh.
[115:31.08]He knows.
[115:38.84]This game would be so much more suspenseful if the music wasn't going crazy all the time.
[115:43.26]Like a hundred percent of the time.
[115:45.31]Uh-oh, she stepped in a bear trap right outside the window.
[115:50.45]Why is there a bear trap right there?
[115:55.87]Oh, I stepped in a bear trap.
[115:57.05]Ow, my shoulder.
[116:01.64]Oh, you're dead.
[116:02.36]Alright, I'm running.
[116:06.70]Does the car still work?
[116:09.51]Uh, it might.
[116:10.87]If you can fix it.
[116:11.43]It might.
[116:12.85]Get in there and just pull the lawn mower thing.
[116:14.47]Just pull the thing.
[116:15.15]Come on, Etalyx.
[116:18.11]This is your only chance.
[116:18.83]Holy shit.
[116:21.92]There you go.
[116:23.22]I'm in the car.
[116:23.94]He's behind you.
[116:25.16]Where do I go?
[116:25.86]I don't know.
[116:28.22]He's going to teleport in front of you.
[116:30.02]Watch out.
[116:33.56]Sorry, lady.
[116:35.06]Oh, no, no, no.
[116:35.56]You're good.
[116:36.56]She knocked it down.
[116:37.69]He got knocked down.
[116:40.19]Just back up.
[116:41.53]And get her.
[116:41.97]We're backing up.
[116:42.59]We're backing up.
[116:44.09]You guys will be good.
[116:45.43]He did the cane.
[116:45.89]He did the cane.
[116:46.53]Is she in?
[116:48.55]He teleported.
[116:49.21]Teleported.
[116:49.55]Teleported.
[116:50.03]Teleported.
[116:50.67]He just like hit your mirror with a fucking axe.
[116:55.84]Is she in the car?
[116:56.98]Yeah, he's throwing knives at you.
[117:02.45]I'm just backing up.
[117:03.57]I'm looking at the rear view window right now.
[117:06.51]Driving backwards and hoping for the best.
[117:08.43]I love her face.
[117:09.57]She's like, holy shit, I can't believe it isn't working.
[117:14.58]Oh, he's teleporting, teleporting.
[117:16.98]He's directly in, I don't know which way to turn.
[117:18.92]I don't know.
[117:19.24]Can you just ram him?
[117:20.04]What happens if you run him over?
[117:21.20]No, I don't think you can.
[117:23.98]I love how this is working.
[117:26.64]Where are you supposed to take the car?
[117:28.36]I don't know.
[117:31.30]We're just driving mysteriously backwards down this line.
[117:35.06]Unbeatable strat.
[117:37.32]I think this is a dead end.
[117:40.22]No, you got a little more room.
[117:42.08]You got a little more room.
[117:44.28]Thread the needle.
[117:45.47]You just gotta thread the needle, Italic.
[117:47.59]Alright, where do I go?
[117:48.61]He's behind us now.
[117:51.51]Alright, now go forward.
[117:56.98]We're fine.
[117:58.22]We're fine.
[117:58.62]Just running over the corpses of our fallen friends.
[118:01.72]This is so floaty, by the way.
[118:04.50]I'm going to crash any second now.
[118:06.76]That's all good.
[118:07.30]I have no idea... Oh, you follow the signs.
[118:11.03]I think you're supposed to follow the signs.
[118:12.01]Am I supposed to go left?
[118:13.25]I think you're supposed to go right up there.
[118:16.31]Right?
[118:16.93]Look up here.
[118:17.57]The sign says right.
[118:19.29]See?
[118:21.69]What sign?
[118:22.33]The sign right in front of you.
[118:23.49]It says turn right.
[118:25.56]No, it's like there's nothing there.
[118:27.54]It says the sign says turn right.
[118:31.27]Alright, we're going.
[118:32.55]We're just going this way.
[118:33.43]I think this is right.
[118:37.25]Etalyx is better at driving backwards than forwards.
[118:39.91]Yeah, it seems that way.
[118:41.39]It's actually easier, believe it or not.
[118:42.97]Okay, left or right?
[118:44.11]Take a right.
[118:45.83]Yeah, definitely right.
[118:49.06]I think it's kind of an either way type of deal.
[118:51.30]And be careful.
[118:51.98]You might drive right into him.
[118:54.47]Try to make yourself... Make yourself unpredictable.
[118:59.63]That's good.
[119:00.69]Keep doing that.
[119:01.25]You gotta be fucking unpredictable.
[119:04.25]See?
[119:05.01]There you go.
[119:05.29]You made it.
[119:05.69]It worked.
[119:07.31]We made it.
[119:10.50]I was so unpredictable.
[119:17.26]I was trying to drive unpredictably there at the end.
[119:19.12]It worked.
[119:22.32]That's my good boy.
[119:23.82]You did the thing.
[119:25.12]Mommy has a reward for you.
[119:26.43]You did the thing.
[119:27.43]Come home, sweetheart.
[119:28.71]Give me one sec.
[119:30.09]Pro plays.
[119:31.75]I won the game.
[119:32.39]Microphone muted.
[120:19.67]Hello?
[120:25.50]Quiet stream?
[120:26.14]Yeah, I was muted.
[120:29.08]So this is probably going to be one of my last ones.
[120:32.32]Okay, well this guy gets instantly muted.
[120:38.31]That's how we like instamute.
[120:41.47]Extremely intelligent, wonderful people.
[120:43.89]That's what we do.
[120:45.27]And Etalyx, I don't know if you can hear me.
[120:48.08]Okay, so we're going to be going over here.
[120:56.62]And, yeah, let's get... Vitalik, are you here?
[120:58.30]Can you hear me?
[121:02.56]Oh, he's muted.
[121:06.38]Okay, well, uh, that happened.
[121:09.14]Yeah, uh, whatever.
[121:10.07]It's all good.
[121:10.51]Let's just, uh, let's move on.
[121:11.71]Um, this is my first... My first and last time as Jason.
[121:17.23]Wait, you get to be Jason?
[121:18.55]I'm just saying that so I get to be Jason.
[121:23.23]Alright, I'm actually gonna fix this now.
[121:32.28]Yeah, this is going to be one of my last games.
[121:34.10]I'd say this is probably my last game.
[121:38.66]Say that again?
[121:39.44]This is probably my last game.
[121:41.56]Okay, that sounds good.
[121:44.53]Getting pretty hungry.
[121:45.35]Yeah, me too.
[121:49.07]Me too.
[122:11.37]Me too.
[122:12.03]Me too.
[122:12.63]Me too.
[122:18.23]What's my opinion on the game?
[122:23.62]I think it's fun.
[122:26.08]I think it's probably more fun when you have like six or five to ten friends.
[122:35.20]That's a lot.
[122:35.92]And we are now banned from Twitch.
[122:39.24]That's even if you have like four or five friends.
[122:44.08]Three hour stream.
[122:44.86]This was in fact a four plus hour stream.
[122:48.10]I've been streaming for four hours.
[122:59.20]Ten people's a lot, yeah.
[123:04.76]I don't have four or five friends.
[123:05.96]I know, really.
[123:08.77]It's hard to get any people around.
[123:11.55]Let alone, like, 10.
[123:13.61]I think it's fun, though.
[123:14.57]I like it.
[123:18.01]It does the job.
[123:20.05]It's a fun, like, little party game.
[123:21.52]Are we talking about, like, what we think about the game?
[123:23.30]Yeah, I think it's a fun party game.
[123:25.80]Feels like this... Feels like this could be, like... If there was, like... Oh, boy!
[123:31.42]Oh, boy!
[123:38.70]You're Jason, huh?
[123:42.72]I don't know how to do anything.
[123:44.44]Okay.
[123:44.88]Well, if you find me, then we'll work together.
[123:49.07]I'm gonna go, like, find the guys and set traps and kill them on purpose.
[123:54.27]God, I don't know what any of the buttons are.
[123:58.05]Good luck!
[124:00.21]That's a grab.
[124:00.91]Okay, R is... Middle mouse is knife?
[124:06.80]Dude, I have no idea.
[124:20.08]That's just two, I guess.
[124:22.92]Don't ask me.
[124:23.42]Then comes Jason and walks directly into wall.
[124:33.71]Okay, so now I can like... Okay, the little blips.
[124:36.51]I get it.
[124:36.79]There's my teleport.
[124:42.66]Oh, God.
[124:43.98]That's so jarring and weird.
[124:46.78]What?
[124:46.98]The teleport is?
[124:47.78]Oh, yeah.
[124:48.32]It's weird.
[124:56.47]Did I get her?
[125:00.18]You're already catching people?
[125:03.16]I'm trying to figure out how to play as Jason.
[125:08.36]I guess I got nothing to worry about then.
[125:10.16]Yeah, you pretty much don't have anything to worry about.
[125:11.78]But anyway, talking about what we think about the game, I think you said it's a pretty good party game.
[125:22.71]But in terms of replayability.
[125:24.33]Oh, shit.
[125:25.67]That's me, Jason.
[125:27.89]Oh, damn.
[125:28.43]There's only so many times.
[125:29.91]It's time to go.
[125:31.53]You can, like, get the car, call the police, or... Whatever.
[125:36.48]Oh, damn.
[125:40.24]I'm gonna be... I might not kill one person.
[125:44.68]I have, like, absolutely no idea what I'm doing.
[125:57.13]What is three?
[126:23.07]Come here, you little shit!
[126:32.34]Be friendly, Jason?
[126:33.70]No.
[126:35.66]What does three do?
[126:40.72]Oh, that's what it does.
[126:43.42]Jesus!
[126:54.01]What is R?
[127:04.07]I should have grabbed.
[127:08.23]What the fuck are you doing?
[127:09.31]Uh, what do I do?
[127:12.83]What do I do?
[127:15.63]What?
[127:16.47]What am I doing?
[127:20.31]Oh my god, nobody did that to me when they were Jason.
[127:23.86]What did you do?
[127:25.56]Kill someone?
[127:26.08]Nobody did that to me when I was Jason.
[127:29.66]Yeah.
[127:31.94]Nobody did that to me when I was Jason.
[127:34.04]What?
[127:36.16]Was that a kid?
[127:39.21]Did he just say, I'm going to change your diaper after this?
[127:43.11]Wait, so you're going to change my diaper?
[127:45.35]No.
[127:45.63]Is that you?
[127:46.75]You're next to me.
[127:48.39]Shit!
[127:50.13]That's me.
[127:50.75]I'm behind you.
[127:54.09]I thought I turned off voice chat.
[128:01.04]Like, didn't I fucking turn it off?
[128:02.90]How about this guy's just narrating, like, casually?
[128:14.30]Uh, white woman can't run.
[128:17.26]Nope.
[128:26.98]Thank you for praying!
[128:32.04]Uh, it's kind of... It's kind of quiet, to be honest.
[128:37.07]Uh, not much.
[128:55.74]I'm just gonna play the piano.
[128:57.04]Can I hide in here?
[129:00.10]Wait a minute.
[129:01.34]Somebody was in here!
[129:02.78]Somebody was inside of here!
[129:04.16]That's me!
[129:04.71]That's my boy.
[129:06.57]Hunt them down and make them pay.
[129:10.69]That was me!
[129:15.19]Can I hide in here?
[129:18.87]That's so fucking awesome.
[129:20.93]What?
[129:21.77]Why?
[129:24.86]Holy shit!
[129:28.44]Don't kill me, please.
[129:29.90]Don't kill.
[129:30.91]No kill.
[129:31.63]No kill.
[129:33.51]Good thing I was standing still so that he could experiment with his powers.
[129:38.35]How was I supposed to know?
[129:40.11]I told you I was the other guy there.
[129:42.07]I didn't know.
[129:42.99]I was asking, like, hey, what do you see?
[129:45.76]I didn't see anything.
[129:46.64]So how did you know to interact with the thing?
[129:49.32]I thought I could hide inside the fucking thing.
[129:51.46]So it wasn't lit up at all?
[129:53.82]It was lit up because I thought I could hide inside of it.
[129:56.06]Yeah, it was probably lit up because you knew someone was in there.
[129:58.87]Please, no.
[130:00.03]Please, no.
[130:01.35]Please.
[130:01.83]I want it to be on Team Jason.
[130:09.47]God damn it.
[130:12.01]Ah, shit.
[130:13.31]This is what Jerma does to his followers.
[130:16.55]You think you're gonna fucking do that shit?
[130:19.28]I'm gonna choke you out, motherfucker.
[130:21.87]Thank you for playing the game, I hope you had a good time.
[130:24.36]You little faggot.
[130:26.02]Oh my god, cut that.
[130:28.64]You bitch- Why the fuck is voice va- it's at zero.
[130:35.87]Like, holy fuck.
[130:40.53]This game is rated fucking 17 and up, not like fucking- Did they say something bad?
[130:44.27]They said a bunch- yeah, they did.
[130:48.49]Because there's no voice chat for me right now.
[130:50.61]Why the fuck do I have voice chat?
[130:51.93]This is such bullshit.
[130:52.95]Dan.
[130:58.81]Where is this person?
[131:01.77]Jerma's good at accidentally being Jason.
[131:10.75]This must be with the actions happening.
[131:13.74]I'm just going to try fucking smashing doors.
[131:17.03]So you have no idea where the guy is, right?
[131:19.99]No, I mean, now I do.
[131:22.73]Okay.
[131:23.61]Because he's standing right there.
[131:24.77]I don't know why he lingered outside.
[131:29.03]I thought I could snake up there.
[131:31.71]Why am I doing this?
[131:33.11]What am I doing?
[131:34.35]I can open the door.
[131:36.03]He just randomly threw fireworks down.
[131:39.68]He's just standing here with his mouth agape.
[131:42.34]I mean, why is he not leaving?
[132:04.38]Who are you chasing right now?
[132:05.32]Still the guy with the red scarf?
[132:07.35]Yeah.
[132:10.85]Just scaring him a little bit.
[132:16.28]I think punching the windows isn't terrible.
[132:18.22]If they go out, that's how they get injured probably.
[132:20.32]He almost stepped in the bear trap.
[132:22.41]He stepped in my bear trap.
[132:23.61]He stepped in your bear trap.
[132:25.83]The one that I set like 15 minutes ago.
[132:28.47]Where is it?
[132:29.47]He's in the middle of the hall.
[132:30.97]What?
[132:31.19]He just got out.
[132:32.43]Oh my god.
[132:33.59]He's probably wondering why there's a bear trap there.
[132:35.80]He's resetting it though.
[132:40.54]Collusion.
[132:41.20]Oh, well, he's so dead.
[132:54.16]What's gonna happen next?
[132:57.32]I thought that was Jason.
[132:59.06]Randomly yelling.
[133:01.51]What the fuck?
[133:05.91]That face that he's got the whole time.
[133:08.47]Hang on, let me zoom in on this.
[133:12.89]Fucking god damn it, man.
[133:14.27]I'm just like, I'm not good at Jason.
[133:16.49]I just want to get out of here.
[133:19.41]At least I can open the fucking door.
[133:22.95]I'm gonna get this guy.
[133:29.84]What does R do?
[133:36.42]That was way better from my perspective, by the way.
[133:39.73]Was it?
[133:41.03]Yeah.
[133:42.11]Just wanted you to know that.
[133:43.95]It was very surprising that you killed him.
[133:50.87]Who's left?
[133:51.95]There's only, like, one person left?
[133:53.17]Two people?
[133:53.75]There's two guys, and one of them has a gun.
[133:56.17]Oh, really?
[133:59.71]Yeah, apparently it is possible to kill Jason.
[134:01.61]I want to see that happen.
[134:04.88]Axe KO out of nowhere.
[134:06.50]The teleport is so OP.
[134:11.96]What does four even do?
[134:13.42]I have no idea.
[134:15.78]Not a clue what that does.
[134:19.94]I don't think there's anybody down here, though.
[134:23.30]No.
[134:24.96]What about, like, over here?
[134:28.99]There's two people left.
[134:31.05]One of them is very slow.
[134:33.69]No collusion.
[134:35.93]I didn't say where they were.
[134:43.02]Getting warmer.
[134:43.78]You're getting warmer.
[134:46.02]I have no idea where you are.
[134:47.16]So what you're saying is I should turn into a ringwraith and fucking go find him.
[134:50.40]Hey, somebody found where I was killed.
[134:54.16]Somebody found the closet you killed me at.
[134:58.64]Ooh, okay.
[135:00.02]Ringwraith.
[135:04.09]What's up?
[135:05.27]Didn't expect to see me, did ya?
[135:10.16]How do you find them so easily?
[135:11.40]That's the guy with the gun.
[135:13.04]Did you hit two?
[135:14.04]Two was like, I see you through walls.
[135:19.47]Don't stop, Jason.
[135:20.77]One more person, huh?
[135:21.51]They deserve to die.
[135:22.21]Two was like, I see you through walls.
[135:23.95]It was a point of hiding in cupboards and stuff.
[135:26.83]Maybe they have to be in a certain place, though.
[135:28.75]I don't know.
[135:30.99]I think I have to be like a certain distance away from them.
[135:33.53]Oh, yeah.
[135:40.49]I like how you're just going around systematically neutering everyone.
[135:43.73]Oh, yeah.
[135:47.99]Okay, I'm going to say like this way.
[135:50.16]Which honestly has a strange basis in reality for these movies.
[135:55.30]Yeah.
[135:55.46]Pretty good callback.
[135:56.14]Because don't the kids always get killed because the counselors were having sex or something?
[136:02.22]Something like that.
[136:05.65]And they weren't paying attention and minding their children.
[136:12.65]Jason doesn't like it mom um okay so the number four makes it so that it doesn't play music when you're nearby people it's the stock mode I get it I'm probably gonna you got a minute and a half till police arrive that's why I'm going down here
[136:38.69]I would assume that you're like whoever it is is hanging out by like the road where the police are Or at least like somewhere like here Hmm I feel like I can't say anything I don't want to give anything away.
[137:04.28]Rage is active.
[137:05.30]What the fuck does that mean?
[137:07.20]I want the 1v1
[137:18.68]Well, now you fucking lose.
[137:21.00]Oh no!
[137:25.28]You got a professional gamer that you're playing against right now.
[137:32.44]I want you to know that.
[137:36.65]Okay, maybe not.
[137:39.05]Professional gamer.
[137:45.01]Oh, you're so dead.
[137:46.41]Can you see where she is right now?
[137:47.85]Yeah, yep.
[137:49.29]Is she just like a heat signature on the map or something?
[137:53.67]Oh, you're in the window.
[137:58.13]Oh, you really thought you were going to be able to do that, didn't you?
[138:00.51]Nope.
[138:01.51]Oh, you just walked through?
[138:02.86]I'm just, wah.
[138:04.22]She had another flare, you bastard.
[138:05.50]No matter what they do to you, you cannot die.
[138:11.68]Why she keeps jumping out at these?
[138:12.84]You can never die.
[138:17.45]Oh, you think you're gonna get away from the fucking Harry Potter ghoul?
[138:21.05]Oh shit, you are.
[138:23.81]Oh fuck me, what a mistake.
[138:26.21]Oh, she's messing up pretty bad too right now.
[138:32.62]Yep, she's messed up.
[138:35.56]She's messed up.
[138:39.44]I win.
[138:42.36]What?!
[138:42.56]What did she do?! !
[138:45.82]What the fuck is this?
[138:46.70]Why is she so hard to kill?
[138:48.74]Why does she have all this... Oh no, not the rifle!
[138:51.86]Not the rifle!
[138:59.16]I threw a knife at her.
[139:00.30]I threw a knife at her.
[139:01.34]Hold on, and I got... Oh, she's gonna fucking close the door.
[139:08.13]How do I get out of this?
[139:09.55]Oh my god.
[139:10.09]Hold on, I'm good.
[139:19.75]She is very scared right now.
[139:21.27]That teleport is overpowered.
[139:34.02]Jason might be a little too powerful.
[139:38.04]That's my boy.
[139:39.92]Hunt them down and make them pay.
[139:43.92]You just Harry Potter apparate.
[139:47.05]Yeah, well, is it Harry Potter or is it Lord of the Rings?
[139:50.60]Mommy has a reward for you.
[139:52.32]That's kind of both, isn't it?
[139:53.32]Come home, sweetie.
[139:54.78]What are you talking about?
[139:55.96]The ring wraiths.
[139:56.80]When Harry Potter puts on the ring, that's when the Dementors come, right?
[140:02.44]Oh, no, Bilbo.
[140:03.78]We're talking about different games here.
[140:05.84]No, different movies.
[140:08.76]You sound very confused.
[140:10.97]I'm very confused.
[140:13.61]So there's Dementors in Harry Potter.
[140:16.93]And they have to be expelled with a Patronus.
[140:21.90]Okay.
[140:22.38]And then there's Ring Race in Lord of the Rings.
[140:25.08]And you have to just not wear the ring, idiot.
[140:29.92]Like, as long as you don't put on the ring, you idiot, then you won't attract their attention.
[140:34.63]Alright.
[140:35.01]Well, it's one of those two movies.
[140:37.85]But anyways, I need to get dinner.
[140:41.37]I'm starving.
[140:42.33]Yep.
[140:43.51]Me as well.
[140:44.95]Good place to end on a win.
[140:49.81]Good thing my last life was just sitting there dying inside of a cupboard.
[140:54.93]I thought I was going to hide in that cupboard.
[140:57.76]I did not know you were in there.
[141:00.76]Thanks for playing Etalyx.
[141:03.34]Everyone go follow Etalyx and watch his streams.
[141:05.30]He's a fun guy.
[141:08.21]uh if you're just joining us sorry that we're ending and uh yeah I'm gonna go eat dinner Etalyx as always it's a pleasure I'm sure I'll talk to you that was a fun final round yeah and I'll talk to you soon dude alright good night everybody have a great weekend disconnected okay so uh that was fun the stream started with like anger and ended with like fun you want my final thoughts
[141:38.08]I think that... I would play this again.
[141:40.68]If um... Might be interesting to get like four or five people to play at the same time.
[141:48.72]But definitely really fun.
[141:50.40]I enjoyed it.
[141:50.86]I think Jason might be just a little too powerful.
[141:54.99]He feels so strong.
[141:57.95]Like being able just to teleport... I think that one of those teleports doesn't need to exist.
[142:03.50]The moment you can, like, pick on the map maybe makes sense, so you can get closer to the action.
[142:08.06]But that Ringwraith teleport should be, like, half as far a distance you can travel.
[142:14.52]Maybe even less.
[142:16.89]Anyways, though.
[142:21.75]Thank you so much for watching, as always.
[142:25.93]And I will see you guys.
[142:28.26]Went for about like four and a half hours tonight.
[142:31.44]This is what I wanted.
[142:32.08]I wanted to go for like a little extra.
[142:33.54]Go for like an extra hour or so.
[142:34.61]Because last night's stream was a little short.
[142:38.40]So, take care, everybody.
[142:40.40]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[142:41.62]Now, there's a couple options on Tuesday.
[142:43.68]We might go back to Yakuza on Tuesday.
[142:46.20]Or I might start something else.
[142:48.05]I'm not sure.
[142:48.73]I really hope my capture card, my internal one, is installed and ready to go at that point.
[142:52.67]I'm going to try to get that done this weekend.
[142:55.39]But much love.
[142:56.84]See you guys all soon.
[142:58.18]Take care, everybody, and good night.
[143:10.82]you
