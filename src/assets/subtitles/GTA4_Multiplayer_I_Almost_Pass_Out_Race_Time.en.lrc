[00:09.41]Hey, Stealth, we're not going yet.
[00:11.33]Hey.
[00:11.85]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:12.79]Hold on, let's get on the same... Let's get on the same field here.
[00:17.13]Oh, yeah.
[00:18.89]Jeremy, you picked the same color bike as me.
[00:20.89]I told you I was going bumblebee yellow.
[00:22.65]You didn't listen.
[00:23.11]Look at this.
[00:24.34]Me and Boo Man.
[00:25.14]Look at those guys.
[00:27.30]I love how it says we've been sitting here for 30 seconds, which... Yeah, we have.
[00:31.92]We're just getting ready here.
[00:35.26]Alright, are we ready to do this?
[00:37.58]Stealth, why are you falling down?
[00:39.09]Oh yeah, let's have a biker hangout.
[00:46.77]What?!
[00:47.77]No!
[00:48.41]Wait!
[00:48.73]We didn't say where we were going!
[00:50.23]We didn't say where we were going!
[00:51.93]Alright, I'll slow down until you guys catch up.
[00:55.19]That defeats the point of the race, though, I guess.
[00:58.37]Oh my god.
[01:00.06]Oh my god.
[01:01.54]Dude, how do you... How do you use the nitrous?
[01:05.94]How do you use the nitrous?
[01:07.20]Oh my god!
[01:08.62]It smells like way in the lead somewhere.
[01:12.28]I don't even know where.
[01:12.96]Dude, that nitrous is terrifying.
[01:17.76]It's not working for me.
[01:18.64]Oh, jeez!
[01:19.42]Yeah, it is terrifying.
[01:20.96]Alright, as long as I beat Boo.
[01:25.48]I don't care.
[01:26.70]Ah, the lamppost landed on me.
[01:28.34]I'm in a really lonely race right now.
[01:31.78]Dude, me too.
[01:32.70]Hold on, I'm using my nitrous boosters, baby.
[01:37.65]Where did I even start?
[01:46.79]Oh, God.
[01:47.88]I really need a better bike.
[01:48.98]Okay.
[01:51.17]What?
[01:51.55]Why am I on this thing?
[01:54.23]Wait, wait, wait.
[01:54.63]Did I miss the turn?
[01:56.25]What?
[01:57.03]Oh, damn.
[01:58.41]Oh, dang it.
[01:59.47]I made it the wrong way.
[02:02.69]How do you get in C4 again?
[02:04.43]Down on the deep end.
[02:05.27]Did I get you, Pooman?
[02:06.67]I need to clean up my bike.
[02:08.71]Dude, I'm getting in like a sedan.
[02:09.81]I'm outta here, Pooman.
[02:12.03]I'm outta here.
[02:13.41]It was totally worth it.
[02:16.31]Give me one of these cars.
[02:18.56]Give me this thing, lady.
[02:20.56]Is there even a lady in here?
[02:21.52]I don't even know.
[02:22.08]Hey, how do you change weapons on your, uh... Uh, I think you just get one at a time, it seems like.
[02:27.91]I love how we started with motorcycles, and I'm legit in, like, an SUV right now, trying to, like, come back.
[02:38.26]An SUV?
[02:39.52]Yeah, I'm in an SUV.
[02:40.88]I'm breaking the rules.
[02:45.40]I've lost you still, but you're so far ahead, I'm not even trying to catch up now.
[02:51.14]I'm in fourth?
[02:51.68]It's alright, I'll be in first place in like two seconds.
[02:55.85]This moped sucks.
[03:00.49]It has like cheetah print on its seat.
[03:02.79]Nice.
[03:05.53]Oh!
[03:06.61]Devil.
[03:07.39]I'm going so fast right now.
[03:10.12]Why do we have mopeds?
[03:11.04]Oh my God!
[03:14.18]What just happened?
[03:17.25]Why do we have mopeds?
[03:21.47]Oh my God!
[03:22.45]What just happened?
[03:30.61]Hey, Jerma, get in with me.
[03:31.85]We can win together.
[03:33.07]Wait, we can?
[03:33.59]I don't know.
[03:34.57]Let's try.
[03:35.29]I don't want his dumb moped.
[03:38.60]Lap one of two?
[03:39.91]Oh yeah.
[03:42.27]Oh no!
[03:47.32]He picked me up to be nice and I pushed him out of the driver's seat oh
[04:13.93]Wait a second.
[04:14.57]Stealth, did you say you're already on lap two?
[04:16.43]No.
[04:16.97]Oh, man.
[04:18.45]No, I'm not.
[04:20.93]This is here.
[04:22.33]How are you... You are, like, winning.
[04:24.39]I'm just driving.
[04:26.07]I guess... I don't know.
[04:29.10]Yeah, I don't think me, Jerma, and Boo are actually racing.
[04:32.26]We're just, like, screwing with each other.
[04:39.53]I'm watching you guys just drive around.
[04:46.10]Alright, well, I concede this race.
[04:51.70]I will be the first to concede.
[04:54.60]I concede.
[04:58.47]GTA races.
[05:00.70]Make sure you play on the map that's, like, as big as the entire city.
[05:06.44]Ow, that hurts.
[05:08.10]Are we ready?
[05:08.96]Go.
[05:09.40]Oops.
[05:10.46]How do you change the camera angle?
[05:12.37]Why is it raining?
[05:13.53]Why does it have to be raining?
[05:14.87]Okay, there's already a... My camera's like... Oh, my God!
[05:21.95]Oh, man.
[05:23.81]Oh, you're in the moped now.
[05:25.75]Oh, man.
[05:26.29]Oh, you did.
[05:33.16]Oh no.
[05:33.72]Come here, you!
[05:35.08]No!
[05:38.02]Later.
[05:39.03]That was such a mistake.
[05:41.73]Why did I do that?
[05:45.47]I gotta freaking catch up to stealth and build.
[05:49.73]I can't catch up.
[05:50.97]Both my left eyes are gone.
[05:52.47]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[05:55.38]Goodness.
[06:01.91]Get out of my way, cars!
[06:04.86]Oh, my car is going to explode any second here.
[06:08.88]Come on, get out of the way!
[06:13.76]Go over here, please!
[06:17.16]What?
[06:18.39]I refuse to believe this.
[06:20.39]Alright, can we do this again, but not in the rain?
[06:28.97]So, you know what?
[06:29.75]We're gonna play a little game called Kamikaze Bike.
[06:34.01]Whoever the first son of a bee to turn this god... Take that, Boo!
[06:40.51]Oh, somebody is gonna get this, and they're gonna get it hard.
[06:46.87]Whoever's in... Whoever's in first place... That's what you get for blowing me up last game, Boo.
[06:54.44]I'll get you back, you son of... Bitch.
[06:59.05]I'm gonna pass out!
[07:00.67]I'm gonna pass out!
[07:07.25]I'm gonna pass out!
[07:09.33]Oh man!
[07:26.86]Oh man, I'm just going black.
[07:30.07]Oh, world is closing in.
[07:33.09]No, not again.
[07:52.27]I can't pass out!
[07:55.29]I can't pass out!
[07:58.88]Give me this.
[07:59.94]Sir, I'm gonna have to take your car, because I need it.
[08:01.94]Because I'm in last place.
[08:05.44]That guy screamed pretty blood-curdlingly.
[08:09.71]No, get in!
[08:13.11]Who was just waiting around this corner for me?
[08:16.75]Who is this right here?
[08:19.43]Oh, it's stealth!
[08:25.20]That didn't work.
[08:27.08]All my C4 didn't blow up.
[08:28.30]They're supposed to kill you.
[08:31.68]Whoa.
[08:33.00]Whoa.
[08:34.42]No.
[08:35.96]It's okay.
[08:36.44]Just get out.
[08:36.94]It's easy.
[08:37.50]Just get out and walk away.
[08:38.58]It's fine.
[08:40.56]So, Jerm, I don't want to, like, rush you or anything.
[08:42.92]Yeah.
[08:44.18]But you're the only one who hasn't finished.
[08:46.69]Oh, well, that's alright.
[08:49.47]Oh, by the way, I still have another lap to do after this.
[08:55.02]So let's just say that I lost this match.
[08:58.06]It's going to give you 30 seconds to try and finish.
[09:00.32]Oh, 30 seconds to finish.
[09:01.06]I was waiting at the finish line with, like, 18 C4s, but none of them went off and killed you.
[09:07.58]Good thing we got that, like, 30 seconds for me to, like, do this.
[09:10.00]You only have a max of two C4s or something.
[09:12.59]Oh, really?
[09:13.51]Oh, that's boring.
[09:19.34]I lost the game.
[09:20.40]I won.
[09:24.22]You did.
[09:25.10]I'm not really sure how.
[09:27.09]It was like waiting at the finish line with C4.
[09:30.43]You didn't blow me up.
[09:32.07]I know.
[09:34.35]I love how it's 153, 143, 125, 409.
[09:34.97]What was I doing that whole time?
[09:35.85]Where the hell was I?
