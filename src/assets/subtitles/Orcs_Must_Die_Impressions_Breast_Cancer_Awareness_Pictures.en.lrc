[00:10.00]what is up guys Jerma here with a gameplay commentary but before I get into that I want to talk about the breast cancer awareness pictures that you're about to see thank you every single person that wanted to participate that did participate you guys supported an amazing cause thank you so much guys I was so happy that I filled the server a couple of times
[00:32.91]About 50 or 60 people were involved.
[00:35.74]So thank you so much.
[00:36.88]Here are the pictures.
[00:38.24]They came out great.
[00:39.80]Everybody with a pink hat or a pink miscellaneous item painted.
[00:42.94]I heard a lot of stories from you guys about how you're having family members deal with breast cancer or you've had to deal with family members with breast cancer.
[00:51.20]And it's tough.
[00:51.78]It's tricky for a lot of you guys.
[00:53.11]And I appreciate the fact that everyone came to that server and we all supported it.
[00:57.17]Everybody that's supporting this whole thing, you guys are all awesome.
[01:01.01]Thank you.
[01:01.39]All I can say is thanks.
[01:02.61]And you're supporting a great cause.
[01:04.72]So here is the gameplay.
[01:06.41]A lot of you guys know that the Team Fortress 2 game engine is destroyed right now.
[01:13.35]So you can't even play.
[01:14.79]I personally can't play Team Fortress for more than 10 minutes without crashing to my desktop.
[01:20.33]So I am going to play Orcs Must Die, which is a new strategy tower defense hybrid game.
[01:27.19]Hope you guys enjoy it.
[01:28.45]And hopefully they fix Team Fortress 2 soon so we can all play again.
[01:35.31]Okay, so here we are in Orcs Must Die, and I gotta tell you guys, this is one of the best games I've played this year.
[01:42.06]Haven't played a whole lot of games this year, but this is definitely topping the charts for me.
[01:46.80]If you are unfamiliar, this game is a hybrid of tower defense and strategy elements in the game.
[01:52.91]It's amazing.
[01:53.47]It's really, really great.
[01:54.59]So if you're one of those guys like me that grew up playing Warcraft 3...
[01:59.13]and playing tower defense on Warcraft 3, you are going to absolutely love this game.
[02:04.23]It is amazing to a million degrees.
[02:07.88]So basically what you want to do, I only just started playing this game yesterday.
[02:13.34]So basically what you want to do is you want to defend this thing over here.
[02:18.90]It is a little rift area thing, and you got this guy here that can protect it with you.
[02:24.19]But this thing right here has to be protected, and these doors over here, if you look in the top right of the screen, this door is going to open, and this door down here is going to open as well.
[02:33.26]What's going to happen is orcs, hundreds and hundreds of orcs are going to pour out of those places, and you have to defend them.
[02:40.99]You have to kill them all.
[02:43.16]or else they're going to take that over.
[02:45.20]So how do you do this?
[02:47.30]One way is with your crossbow.
[02:49.36]You can shoot it like this.
[02:50.78]It has a couple of little features too.
[02:52.42]You can do like a stun where it stuns them in place.
[02:55.16]But the cool part about this game and why it's sort of like tower defense is because you have all these things you can put down
[03:01.53]So I have started to upgrade, or I've already upgraded this poison spike trap.
[03:06.03]And I use the super boom barrel, but I'm not going to use that right now because I'm going to use the arrow walls.
[03:11.51]But you can, as you can see, customization is really, really interesting in this game.
[03:15.07]And look at how many spells you're going to actually end up getting.
[03:18.08]It's a whole lot of fun.
[03:19.18]And as you'll see, what I'm going to do here is place a couple of spike traps over here.
[03:23.32]They're going to come from this way too.
[03:26.21]So let's go over this way too.
[03:27.59]Bang.
[03:28.69]Bang.
[03:30.22]And this guy.
[03:31.18]I just got this guy.
[03:32.02]I don't know what the hell he does.
[03:33.78]We're going to put him right here though.
[03:35.90]And we're going to put this guy.
[03:37.82]Rotate with R. Okay.
[03:40.08]So as you see these guys are going to shoot the orcs that come down the hallway.
[03:43.51]So let's unleash the horde.
[03:45.35]And look at the top right of the screen.
[03:46.47]You can see where they're coming from.
[03:47.59]They're coming from right here.
[03:48.53]So let's get them.
[03:51.45]The cool part about this game, guys, is you can string together combos and headshots and stuff like that.
[03:55.87]It is a very, very fun game.
[03:58.49]I gotta tell you right now, like I said before, it's one of the funner games I've ever played.
[04:03.10]And I've played a lot of games like this, and this one is one of the ones that takes the cake.
[04:06.68]It's awesome.
[04:07.16]Oh my god.
[04:08.46]Stun him!
[04:10.44]These archers are actually pretty sick.
[04:11.94]Oh, they can get killed.
[04:12.72]I did not know that.
[04:14.39]I did not know that.
[04:16.82]So yeah, that's the first wave.
[04:18.54]So as you'll know, if you play tower defense before, you have multiple waves to deal with.
[04:23.49]And you have a few seconds between each wave.
[04:25.97]So let's, oh god, put a couple more spike traps here.
[04:30.67]Oh boy, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[04:34.73]Oh my god.
[04:36.27]Oh, you know, I need those archers.
[04:38.40]Sick.
[04:39.68]I need more of those archers.
[04:41.44]Oh boy, this is not looking good right now.
[04:44.54]I'm being really inaccurate.
[04:45.48]See, if you look at the crosshair, the crosshair, oh god, stun him.
[04:49.48]The crosshair will shrink.
[04:52.10]It's kind of like in, if you know Team Fortress, when, oh, they're killing my archers.
[04:55.69]In Team Fortress, when you are shooting the gun, like with the ambassador, let's just say, for instance, if you have the ambassador, it's very, very accurate on the first shot, and you see how I'm collecting headshots right here.
[05:06.03]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[05:09.41]Bang me a bunch of headshots, baby.
[05:12.44]So it's kind of, you get more inaccurate the more you shoot.
[05:16.81]And that's it for that wave.
[05:18.05]I gotta put some more archers down.
[05:19.31]And the money is in the lower right.
[05:21.19]So these cost 600.
[05:21.83]I'm gonna, you know what, let's do this.
[05:24.99]They're probably gonna come from the other side.
[05:28.15]Let's do this.
[05:29.94]You can't get my impenetrable, oh yeah, they're coming to the other side.
[05:32.72]I'm gonna have my archers shoot that way and I'm gonna shoot these guys coming around here.
[05:36.50]See if that works out.
[05:37.64]Oh god, the little freaks, they run fast.
[05:40.82]Alright, cool, cool.
[05:42.16]Stop where you're going right now, brother.
[05:45.89]So there's a whole lot of strategy, and you can play this game a million different ways.
[05:50.11]I am selecting my way, I'm doing my own thing, but you can do your own thing.
[05:53.72]There's endless possibilities, guys.
[05:56.30]It is a whole lot of fun.
[05:57.48]Highly suggest you pick this game up.
[05:59.64]It is only 15 bucks.
[06:02.67]So, yeah, that is completely and totally worth it.
[06:05.87]So now I have a break.
[06:07.21]I have a couple levels left to do.
[06:09.19]Let me pull out my... You know what?
[06:11.19]I'm going to keep this going.
[06:13.01]Let's keep these archers here.
[06:15.13]Let's do a ton of archers.
[06:17.71]Oh, baby.
[06:19.37]You think you're going to get by this?
[06:21.45]I got my crew with me, my crew of mad archers.
[06:26.05]Oh, let's do it.
[06:27.59]Unleash the horde, where are they coming from?
[06:29.13]Yeah, I'll go this way again, and they'll take out that other side.
[06:32.88]Oh, let me bank some headshots.
[06:36.09]Oh, boy.
[06:38.03]Nice.
[06:39.07]Nice.
[06:39.45]How are they doing?
[06:41.09]Okay, they're doing alright.
[06:42.77]They're doing alright.
[06:43.43]I better go over there and assist.
[06:45.33]No, they don't even need me.
[06:46.39]They don't even need me.
[06:48.83]Okay, I might need some help over here, though.
[06:51.49]Unfortunately, guys, there is no co-op in this game.
[06:56.51]I really wish there was.
[06:58.09]I really do.
[06:59.45]Because this would be so much fun with two or three people.
[07:01.87]Oh, my God.
[07:04.42]I'll be alright.
[07:04.98]I'll be alright.
[07:06.20]Come on.
[07:06.46]Let me just bang some headshots on you guys.
[07:09.98]You can also pull out your staff or your sword, whatever it is.
[07:13.04]I don't have it equipped because I don't really use it, to be honest.
[07:17.81]And look at that.
[07:19.09]These archers, oh, they don't even stand a chance.
[07:20.95]So now I'll put one more there.
[07:23.15]And I'm going to come over here.
[07:25.67]And let's put a couple this way because I'm going to get smoked if I don't.
[07:31.35]Very cool.
[07:32.17]Let's do it.
[07:33.87]They got it.
[07:34.20]They got that.
[07:34.96]I don't even have to go over there.
[07:36.06]They got that covered.
[07:37.88]Oh, wow.
[07:38.30]This is awesome.
[07:40.58]So, you're seeing I'm using the archers.
[07:41.79]I'm going to be using them a whole lot more.
[07:44.99]How's this side looking?
[07:46.19]That's alright.
[07:46.75]I look good.
[07:47.21]Looking good.
[07:48.72]Freeze, baby.
[07:51.91]And the more points you get after you kill a group, let's say, see on the left there, I just got 100 points for stringing together some kills.
[07:58.72]You spend those points, you get skills, and you can upgrade your abilities, which gives it like RPG feel too.
[08:05.14]Oh, it's just, it's fantastic, guys.
[08:07.28]I gotta tell you, it is fantastic.
[08:09.96]And here comes the final wave.
[08:12.70]Let's go with a couple more archers over here, just because I can.
[08:17.74]And let's do it.
[08:19.30]I'm ready for you.
[08:21.41]They're coming on both sides.
[08:23.63]Little freak shows.
[08:24.41]Don't stand a chance, baby.
[08:27.67]They're good.
[08:28.31]Are they good over there?
[08:28.99]Let me shoot a long-range stun.
[08:32.24]Oh, boy.
[08:33.94]See, some people just shoot violently, like... I like to be a little bit more precise with it.
[08:38.92]Try and get some headshots.
[08:39.82]Get a few extra points.
[08:41.36]You guys know the deal.
[08:44.59]Oh, come on now.
[08:45.73]Oh, what's that?
[08:46.23]Three in a row?
[08:47.37]Let me get a three-piece.
[08:48.41]Let me get a three... Oh, shoot.
[08:49.35]Shoot.
[08:51.13]Oh, this is looking kind of... Oh, they're good.
[08:53.89]They're good.
[08:54.25]We're good.
[08:57.07]It is game over.
[08:58.45]They got nothing.
[08:59.87]So I'll show you the ending screen.
[09:01.13]He does a funny little dance.
[09:02.36]It's actually pretty awesome.
[09:04.60]And here we go.
[09:05.20]Here's the dance.
[09:08.38]So yeah, if you have not bought this game already, go buy it right now.
[09:11.62]It's on Steam.
[09:12.46]It is incredible.
[09:14.14]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[09:15.52]Actually, no.
[09:16.00]Let me show you this first.
[09:17.87]Got my point C buy upgrades.
[09:20.31]See, I have six skulls after doing a bunch of things.
[09:24.61]This is 14 to upgrade.
[09:27.16]And this makes it cheaper.
[09:28.20]It makes archers cheaper because they're kind of expensive.
[09:30.58]But you get the deal.
[09:31.36]And this eventually is going to fill with abilities.
[09:33.68]And the replayability is just amazing.
[09:37.18]So yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed this.
[09:39.23]And maybe I'll do more of this series.
[09:41.05]Maybe I'll do more of this because it's a very, very interesting game.
[09:43.95]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[09:45.55]And take care, everybody.
