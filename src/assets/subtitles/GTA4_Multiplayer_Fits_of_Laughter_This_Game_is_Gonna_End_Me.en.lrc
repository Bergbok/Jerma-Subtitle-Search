[00:15.23]Oh my god.
[00:18.69]Boo, where are we going?
[00:19.63]You're right down there.
[00:21.83]Are you in a car or a bike?
[00:24.13]Good car.
[00:24.69]Let's go kill the other two.
[00:26.48]Cops are after you.
[00:29.40]I've been laying low, man.
[00:31.02]Oh, hey, there you are.
[00:33.34]How did I not get hurt by that?
[00:35.24]Go kill Jerma and Starbuck.
[00:36.44]Dude, you're sandwiching me!
[00:37.58]Oh my god!
[00:38.84]I'm helping, I'm blocking the door.
[00:40.45]Alright, I'm getting in.
[00:42.33]This cop is after me right now, by the way.
[00:44.19]Hurry up, hurry up.
[00:47.15]No, dude!
[00:48.75]I thought you were ready!
[00:51.77]He just started shooting at me when I opened the door.
[00:55.37]What is going on?
[00:57.37]Is this like the finale of the fireworks?
[00:59.01]What the hell is going on here?
[01:01.28]I told you.
[01:02.06]Dude, seriously, this is like the 4th of July.
[01:05.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, get in the car, get in the car.
[01:07.40]This is like the last ten minutes of Die Hard.
[01:10.28]This prick just like ran me over.
[01:12.24]Hey, your car is on fire, by the way, I'm not getting in it.
[01:16.75]Well, it wasn't a second ago.
[01:18.25]Your car is on fire, you're dead.
[01:21.44]Oh, God.
[01:22.90]Dude, I switched.
[01:24.74]Dude, just go up.
[01:26.46]Oh, okay.
[01:26.90]Steal that guy's car.
[01:28.19]No, there's tires on fire.
[01:29.63]I don't want to.
[01:30.43]I'm getting... Oh, my God.
[01:31.97]Get in.
[01:32.29]Get in.
[01:33.19]Get in.
[01:33.71]Okay.
[01:34.39]Dude, it's like DJ.
[01:34.93]It's like Armageddon.
[01:35.65]Why?
[01:35.83]Why did that happen?
[01:57.93]Dude, seriously, you guys are dicks.
[02:03.29]Oh, the sign.
[02:04.85]Oh my god, this is terrifying.
[02:07.85]I feel like this is a boss fight.
[02:13.08]Like, hey, where's, like, your health on the top of the screen?
[02:16.12]Isaac!
[02:18.32]Like, seriously, my view, oh my god.
[02:21.12]Alright, there's, like, your health at the top of the screen.
[02:23.74]Boss fight, like, the commander of the military or something.
[02:27.13]This is, like, finding advice you can say for us.
[02:30.83]This is, like... Oh, careful there.
[02:32.27]Um...
[02:37.35]You can't lose the beast.
[02:39.07]I'm coming back to you.
[02:39.97]There's a helicopter that is raining fire down on us all.
[02:44.37]This is so hard to control.
[02:48.47]These guys are taking too many turns.
[02:50.01]What?
[02:50.23]I shot that guy.
[02:51.83]I shot that guy off the bike.
[02:54.95]It is so hard to turn on this.
[02:57.02]You guys are so far away.
[02:58.12]I don't know how the hell you ended up getting a rocket over here.
[03:03.22]Bail!
[03:08.04]Alright, so I'm going to stand right here.
[03:13.50]Stop.
[03:14.40]This cop just did a new barrel roll.
[03:18.52]That cop just did like a nine foot barrel roll.
[03:23.18]Are you serious?
[03:29.12]I am gonna run your Jeep over with my bike.
[03:31.66]Okay, stop!
[03:34.70]We have to do stunts.
[03:37.20]What stunt are we trying to do?
[03:39.16]Dude, we have to do this guy!
[03:44.97]What a psycho!
[03:49.99]Why do we have to go this way?
[03:51.13]GPS, you always take the weird routes.
[03:56.60]And, okay.
[03:58.45]This is not the highway.
[04:03.29]Why did that happen?
[04:06.82]Oh god.
[04:07.16]I just saved you from Starr.
[04:08.68]He was about to kill you.
[04:10.08]I changed my mind at the last minute.
[04:11.94]This is very difficult to get in position.
[04:14.32]Try and get in position.
[04:15.58]If I can land on you with the car, this might be ridiculous.
[04:21.27]I'm gonna go right here.
[04:23.49]I'm not gonna go any further.
[04:24.93]I'm gonna go straight off from right there, right?
[04:26.93]This is I need to get this spawn.
[04:28.21]How do you want this you for I?
[04:29.85]press down on the
[04:56.19]Oh God, I sunk my jaw.
[04:59.98]I had my hands off the camera.
[05:02.90]First time in a... Ha ha ha!
[05:10.29]Ha ha ha!
[05:12.35]Ha ha ha!
[05:18.60]I wasn't even paying attention until it happened.
[05:22.65]You had no idea.
[05:23.41]I just saw you launch off the blade.
[05:29.43]What happened to the helicopter?
[05:32.47]Oh man, that was so funny from my point of view.
[05:34.34]I had no idea it was there.
[05:35.22]I was trying to adjust the position, like slowly working out the angles, and then incoming.
[05:41.44]Nobody even knew that was going to happen.
[05:42.94]He just did it.
[05:43.76]I just didn't shoot off a fucking comet.
[05:46.35]I'm flying around.
[05:48.52]I'm at the airport.
[05:49.68]I see, like, you.
[05:51.90]I don't see you.
[05:53.18]Oh, hey.
[05:55.68]I'm not, like, touching anything right now.
[05:58.74]Look at you.
[06:00.53]You look great.
[06:01.21]Oh, God.
[06:09.68]Oh my god, dude.
[06:12.40]I can't believe I smashed into you like that.
[06:15.44]So you were just spinning... Oh my god.
[06:18.58]Spinning, and then you chopped off and I fell to my death.
[06:22.34]Alright, I'm going to the Empire State Building.
[06:25.61]And when I say Empire State Building, I mean just coming for you guys.
[06:28.37]Just trying to shoot your faces up.
[06:32.79]And...
[06:37.89]Oh my god.
[06:39.15]This isn't Battlefield.
[06:40.83]Oh god, no.
[06:44.97]I was trying to blade your car.
[06:46.68]Booster.
[06:47.02]What am I trying to do?
