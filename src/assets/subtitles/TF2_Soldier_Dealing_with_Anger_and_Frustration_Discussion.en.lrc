[00:08.56]Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and today gonna be playing as the I'm not sure because I have not recorded it yet and that's gonna be the topic of this video I've been having a pretty bad week the last four or five days or so you probably saw on Twitter a lot of things just are not clicking for me right now and the most recent thing that has been a little bit on the like WTF son of a bitch
[00:36.90]Like, throw a friggin' glass vase into the wall and have it explode, and have, like, the shards of glass go everywhere and stick it- Oh, you get the idea.
[00:45.04]I lost everything on my hard drive last night, and it- I wouldn't normally be that upset about this, because I usually back stuff up, but because of PAX and because of all the head injury BS, I had- I didn't really think about it.
[00:57.90]And the one, like, week that I didn't back up my files, of course, is the week where everything goes kaput.
[01:05.00]And...
[01:06.12]It sucks.
[01:06.91]It really does, because there was a lot of great footage I had recorded.
[01:09.75]I don't want to, you know, say what videos they were, because I don't want to get anybody's hopes up, because there were some really cool things I was working on, and they're just gone now.
[01:17.95]So I'm going to move on from that.
[01:19.55]I want to talk about the actual purpose of this video, and it's...
[01:23.25]building frustrations and how to stop from freaking out because I got pretty close when this happened I was really god damn close to like I said I have a lamp sitting on my desk I grabbed it by the neck the lamp neck and I was about to swing it around like a friggin lasso and throw it into the wall that almost happened I almost did that because like I said I had a lot of cool things I was working on
[01:48.35]But I didn't do it.
[01:49.49]I took a step back and I said, it's not worth doing that.
[01:52.71]I don't want to, like, rage delete my wall, because that's what would have happened.
[01:56.37]It would have been like a thousand dollar repair, because this thing's pretty heavy.
[01:59.47]It's a pretty big lamp.
[02:00.73]I don't think you guys have ever seen that.
[02:02.17]I don't think you've ever seen it on a webcam or anything like that.
[02:04.57]But it's fairly large and heavy, and that would have been even worse, even more adding to my troubles this week.
[02:11.30]But it got me thinking.
[02:13.18]when the world seems like it does not want you to do anything, when the world is like, you got the Earth, planet Earth is sitting up in the sky, we're all on it, and it's got a face and it's just saying to itself, you know, this, like, two-week period, you know, just screw Jerma-985, let's just, like, kill him, let's just, like, throw him down a flight of stairs, delete his hard drive, and, like, stick a broom up his ass, except that didn't happen, the broom part, I mean.
[02:36.25]But when it feels like the world is out to get you for a certain amount of time...
[02:41.35]You can build up a lot of frustration, you can try to find a way to vent it out, and I think I found the solution.
[02:47.46]And the solution is... there is no solution.
[02:50.48]You have to suck it up and you have to keep going.
[02:52.93]As weird as that sounds, as bad advice as that sounds,
[02:56.85]There is no solution to bad outcomes, to bad solutions.
[03:01.37]If your hard drive gets deleted and you try to do the recovery options and everything fails, that's it.
[03:07.01]It's gone.
[03:07.65]If you take a dive into a wall and you smash your head into a wall and you have stitches in your face, it's over.
[03:12.51]You cannot time travel.
[03:13.91]There is no such thing as time travel.
[03:15.32]You cannot go back in time and change anything.
[03:18.38]As much as you desperately wish you could, you just can't.
[03:23.29]And until Bill Gates designs a time machine, or Steve Jobs, wait, Steve Jobs is dead.
[03:29.76]Well, until somebody makes a time machine, this is all not possible.
[03:34.58]So what you have to do is what I did today, and that's remove yourself completely from the frustrating situation.
[03:42.34]If it's a bunch of different things, then you're gonna have to try and find your happy place somewhere.
[03:46.99]Go to the pizza parlor, go to, like, Burger King, and just go sit down and relax for a second.
[03:52.39]if you have an injury like I do or something don't look and don't even look in the mirror and say man my head looks like no don't even do that just walk away and pretend like it's not even there same thing with like I said a computer problem I was sitting in this chair for 45 minutes straight pointing with an open hand in the middle of the screen going why why did this happen what the hell what the and then after like I said 45 minutes went by
[04:17.25]I said, what am I doing here?
[04:19.01]Like, this is not going to solve the problem.
[04:21.36]Me pointing angrily at the screen is not going to solve my hard drive problem.
[04:26.26]It's over.
[04:26.98]You have to deal with it and you have to move on.
[04:29.08]And I brought this up in... How ironic, guys.
[04:31.89]I brought this same topic up a couple videos ago when I talked about my stitches.
[04:36.29]And it still is true after four or five days of frustration.
[04:40.69]And we all have our ways of dealing with frustration.
[04:43.05]We all have our ways of venting, so to speak.
[04:45.58]And it might not be a bad idea to pick up something like a punching bag or one of those things I see on TV sometimes.
[04:53.06]It's been a while, but it's a legitimate dummy that you punch in the face.
[04:56.94]Like, that's what it's designed for you to do.
[04:58.42]It's a workout machine, but screw that.
[05:01.45]I just want to beat up the dummy and get my, like, anger out.
[05:04.15]Because obviously the desk and the lamp and the computer screen, you do not want to break those things.
[05:10.07]You just want to vent your frustration and your anger.
[05:12.68]So it's probably a good idea.
[05:13.98]You know what?
[05:14.46]I'm doing it.
[05:14.92]I'm going to buy one of those dummies so I can kick his ass every couple weeks when I feel down.
[05:21.07]But to wrap up this video, I want to open the comment section up to you guys, and we'll have a little venting session, I guess.
[05:28.38]Something in the last week, or a couple weeks, or a couple months, doesn't matter the time frame.
[05:32.34]Something that really pissed you off, or that you're dealing with right now.
[05:36.40]Vent in the comments if you're comfortable.
[05:38.22]I'd like to see some of the different situations a lot of you guys are going through.
[05:41.28]And maybe I'll add a couple things to the discussion as well, because we're all venting together.
[05:45.29]This is like group therapy with Jerma.
[05:48.45]So leave me whatever you want guys in the comment section and hopefully I can get some more videos out here soon I had a lot of stuff planned and yes, it sucks really badly, but where's my dummy?
[05:59.26]Let's go kick his ass dummy.
[06:00.92]Where you at?
[06:02.36]I'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody
