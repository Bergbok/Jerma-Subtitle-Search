[01:04.67]Hi guys.
[01:07.25]So, today might be very, very short stream.
[01:13.20]Might not even exist at all.
[01:15.88]We're gonna see how long we can go.
[01:17.18]We might be able to go for a few hours, I'm not sure.
[01:22.28]But I don't want to start... I don't want to start a new game, really.
[01:25.77]Because it just screws everything up.
[01:28.29]If I'm going to start Metro, or if I'm going to start Alpha Protocol, I want that to be when I'm guaranteed, no, the whole thing ain't going to come down in like 42 minutes, right?
[01:37.93]Because if I get into Metro, I do... Oh, stream's over, bye!
[01:41.75]I don't want to do that.
[01:45.17]So what we're going to do is we're going to do a test stream right now.
[01:48.95]We're going to do a test stream with...
[01:51.74]The game Ride Carnival Tycoon.
[01:57.74]This is one of those... Can I move with the seagull stream?
[02:03.27]This is one of those... It was in the bundle for all those shitty pet games.
[02:07.39]I don't know why.
[02:07.93]So, I don't know.
[02:10.63]We're going to play this for a little while.
[02:16.80]I didn't know that music was going to be that loud, but you're going to have to deal with it for a minute.
[02:26.51]Hold on, let me just fix this.
[02:31.96]So bear with me while we sit here and hope that the stream still works.
[02:38.18]I make this joke right now, but what if we just end up playing Ride Carnival?
[02:41.38]You know what?
[02:43.17]I think we're just gonna play Ride Carnival Tycoon tonight.
[02:46.04]I'm so scared of my internet.
[02:47.86]I don't want to start like a new game.
[02:49.28]Alright, let me grab, hold on.
[02:53.78]Let me grab it.
[02:54.44]I gotta like get my phone.
[02:55.40]I'll be right back.
[02:57.04]Give me a sec.
[04:40.20]I'm just looking for dropped frames.
[04:44.12]I'm so paranoid.
[04:45.34]I swear, man.
[04:51.88]Why can't I get guaranteed upload speeds?
[04:57.98]Anywho.
[04:59.44]Let me just make a tweet.
[05:00.83]I'm dragging this intro out very much so.
[05:03.87]Yes, I know I am.
[05:06.94]But you have to give me at least a little bit of leeway here.
[05:12.04]I'm terrified of my internet.
[05:16.37]Go to my dashboard.
[05:17.37]I'm telling you, we're going to get started.
[05:22.05]We're going to really get the ball rolling.
[05:26.83]And then see you later.
[05:28.14]It's going to diarrhea on itself.
[05:32.96]Let's move that down here.
[05:38.54]Okay.
[05:41.51]Alright, let's do it.
[05:43.11]Let's play... Let's play Ride Carnival Tycoon.
[05:46.61]It's gonna do the missions, I think.
[05:53.77]Why was it on beat with the song?
[05:55.59]Was it actually on beat?
[05:59.39]Oh, the planets?
[06:00.23]Am I gonna have to steal this song?
[06:17.24]You know people are gonna see the title and they're gonna think this is some kind of net neutrality stream Yeah, I'm currently running a petition if you please sign it we're fighting against the Internet No, it's actually just me being a dickhead
[06:41.68]Alright, let's do it.
[06:42.24]Let's just go.
[06:43.92]Oh, no!
[06:44.24]It's already fucking dying!
[06:45.98]No, don't!
[06:46.64]Come on!
[06:47.76]Come on!
[06:48.90]I just turned it on!
[06:50.46]I just turned the fucking stream on!
[06:52.69]And you're gonna go down on me now, already.
[07:00.43]It just turned yellow.
[07:01.45]I... Right when I hit the tweet button!
[07:06.28]Welcome to Ride Carnival, Tycoon.
[07:10.46]It's fine?
[07:10.98]No, I know it's fine right now, but I just, I looked over, and all of a sudden... Uh, we're gonna go medium.
[07:24.15]We're gonna start the game.
[07:25.83]Uh, Kiddieland.
[07:28.61]11 a.m.
[07:28.91]to 7 p.m.
[07:30.27]Powermizer, 10 to 10.
[07:34.37]Thrillville.
[07:36.71]Keep it clean.
[07:39.43]Taste of Carnival, Be Happy, Vegas Roadshow.
[07:42.46]I can't do that one?
[07:43.10]Come on.
[07:45.78]Alright, well we're gonna go to Kittieland.
[07:47.46]Cause that's the easiest one.
[07:50.48]Wait, is it?
[07:53.44]Isn't this the name of a Peggle game?
[07:55.54]Where you're a frog and you shoot stuff at people?
[07:57.78]You like spit out clams?
[08:01.92]I wanna go to that one too.
[08:03.30]How do I get out of here?
[08:04.30]We're gonna just go to Kittieland.
[08:05.48]We're just testing the stream.
[08:08.05]School's out and the kids are looking for some fun.
[08:09.91]Your challenge is to create a carnival using only kid-friendly rides and earn a profit of $3,000 before the end of the short day.
[08:23.02]Hmm.
[08:23.36]Okay.
[08:26.66]I get 9,000 bucks.
[08:27.36]Earn $3,000 before the end.
[08:27.98]You only have access to kid-friendly rides.
[08:34.61]Where was the- there was no tutorial of how to play this game.
[08:38.05]Is this just a terrible, like, park tycoon game?
[08:40.31]I don't understand, what- hold on, I have to build a park in a- I gotta put kid rides in a parking lot?
[08:48.08]Isn't that dangerous?
[08:52.08]Where does it want me to put this shit?
[08:56.18]You want me to put this shit in, like, a fucking garage?
[08:59.16]Alright, let's start.
[09:02.34]Uh, rides.
[09:05.15]I need some bathrooms.
[09:08.01]It really isn't a parking lot.
[09:11.18]That's a lot of money for a bunch of bathrooms.
[09:13.60]Oh shit, I think this person's hungry.
[09:14.92]What are you doing here?
[09:20.23]Oh, excuse me.
[09:21.75]This is a park for children.
[09:24.87]I need to buy some tickets.
[09:25.83]Okay, shit, I gotta make tickets.
[09:27.63]This is supposed to be a kid's theme park.
[09:29.01]Wait, is this guy going right to the bathroom?
[09:33.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:34.38]Ticket booth.
[09:35.80]Get it.
[09:36.04]Alright, there it is.
[09:38.62]And we'll get two of these ticket booths back to back.
[09:42.33]Uh, generator.
[09:43.03]Alright, there's enough power to run a carnival.
[09:47.15]You got it.
[09:48.61]Parking lot carnival.
[09:52.30]Uh, we don't need any of this stuff.
[09:54.34]We need a generator truck too.
[09:56.42]I don't even know how to swing this around.
[10:00.88]You know what?
[10:02.08]Guys?
[10:03.14]Guys?
[10:04.46]I think I won.
[10:06.00]And I'll tell you one reason why.
[10:08.88]How many children parks have you been to when the only attraction is a giant truck?
[10:17.23]I think I'm good to go.
[10:18.17]You know how many times I've gone with my niece and nephew to a place where the attraction is like a fucking fire engine?
[10:25.77]I think I get to win.
[10:29.67]Apparently not, though.
[10:30.57]Alright, we got... Okay, rides.
[10:33.81]That's all kids like is like funny lights and cars.
[10:36.49]Look, watch this.
[10:44.70]There.
[10:45.72]There's the main attraction.
[10:48.64]Okay, I don't have any access to rides.
[10:51.73]There we are.
[10:52.33]The Wizotron.
[10:55.27]Orbiter the black hole I can't give that can put the kids on black hole Alright, we're gonna do Wild West Express.
[11:05.96]Oh Come on really Every single one of them has one of these things too and it's gonna go right by the truck.
[11:16.20]Everyone's gonna be happy.
[11:16.99]Oh
[11:20.23]Have we dropped any frames yet?
[11:21.71]Alright, we're going to the witching hour here.
[11:24.53]This guy's gonna buy a ticket.
[11:29.28]All the adults rushed over to buy tickets.
[11:34.62]Don't even tell me that all these adults are gonna ride this train.
[11:40.06]Are they?
[11:41.92]Why did you buy a ticket for then?
[11:47.05]There's no rhyme or reason.
[11:48.21]Alright, price is two tickets.
[11:51.91]And it's direct hourly cost report.
[11:53.93]That's fine.
[11:54.51]Okay, hold on.
[11:56.57]I want to get off the Mr. Bones wild ride, right?
[11:59.59]Isn't that the joke?
[12:03.15]I want to get off the ride.
[12:04.25]I actually think you get... Oh, man.
[12:15.90]That's as long as you can make it.
[12:17.90]Wait time.
[12:18.46]Alright, these guys are going to be on this for five minutes.
[12:24.49]I want to put people on a roller coaster for five minutes.
[12:29.59]Okay, well that's fine.
[12:30.85]They can have that kind of fun.
[12:32.11]Any more fun stuff to do?
[12:33.45]How much money do I need?
[12:34.23]How much profit do I need?
[12:36.26]3,000?
[12:36.38]Easy.
[12:36.60]I already did it.
[12:37.60]Pretty much won.
[12:39.96]Alright, we'll get the slide out there.
[12:41.16]The tarantula.
[12:46.33]There it is.
[12:47.91]This one's gonna be... Five seconds.
[12:52.79]This one's gonna be cheap, but quick.
[12:55.25]No wait time.
[12:55.89]Mm-hmm.
[13:03.02]Riding the circle.
[13:07.58]Alright, let's see.
[13:08.24]At our children's theme park.
[13:11.74]You do the percentages here.
[13:13.86]One, two, three, four.
[13:18.40]This is 75% adults.
[13:25.27]Okay.
[13:27.87]What is this line for?
[13:28.99]What is the line?
[13:30.47]Wait, let's do the math.
[13:31.51]I'm gonna do it right now.
[13:32.09]I'm gonna count every person here right now.
[13:33.27]Here we go.
[13:35.56]We've got one.
[13:41.29]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[13:42.43]5 adults, 1 child.
[13:43.93]5, 1.
[13:43.97]5, 2.
[13:44.21]6, 3.
[13:44.25]4, 5.
[13:44.29]6, 6.
[13:44.35]7.
[13:44.37]7 to 6.
[13:44.53]7 to 6.
[13:44.73]We get 7.
[13:45.03]7 to 7.
[13:45.33]8, 9, 10.
[13:45.43]7 to 7.
[13:46.93]10 to 7.
[13:47.15]11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[13:49.57]15 to 9.
[14:12.45]10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[14:19.48]20 to 11.
[14:21.48]There are 20 adults and 11 children in this park.
[14:26.06]That doesn't work.
[14:27.30]Actually, that makes perfect sense.
[14:29.00]That means like two parents for every one child.
[14:31.40]So never mind.
[14:31.96]But why are they all riding the rides?
[14:33.24]I need to make more fucking carousels.
[14:39.12]Oh shit, wait.
[14:39.96]Root beer hot dogs.
[14:44.83]None of this matters.
[14:46.77]We're only playing this for 20 minutes.
[14:51.68]Root beer.
[14:55.88]Why am I invested?
[14:59.50]And that's ice cream.
[15:03.39]Times it by 8.
[15:07.19]All I care about is that profit getting to 3000.
[15:15.35]Alright, profit's going down.
[15:16.33]Why is Earth still here?
[15:21.43]Because this... You guys didn't get a chance to say goodbye to your memes.
[15:25.89]And it might not even be today either.
[15:30.10]I'm just losing like $5 an hour.
[15:37.98]Ride never stops.
[15:38.80]Alright, we're gonna go slow motion?
[15:40.41]No.
[15:41.25]Can I build my own roller coaster?
[15:42.41]Get me the fuck out of here.
[15:44.24]Let's go to sandbox mode.
[15:47.56]How do I leave?
[15:51.80]Yes.
[15:53.14]Let me just do sandbox mode.
[15:57.36]Abe Johnson's Yard.
[16:00.89]No, I want a big spot.
[16:02.95]Let's go to the Walmart parking lot.
[16:05.05]Ticket price is 25 cents.
[16:07.11]Free tickets.
[16:08.51]As many as I can put here.
[16:13.80]20 free tickets, uh, advertising.
[16:16.01]We're gonna make this a huge, huge deal.
[16:19.15]No, no, no.
[16:19.49]No TV shit.
[16:20.49]Only newspaper and only, like, only newspaper.
[16:25.23]Okay, here we go.
[16:25.69]I'm gonna make one roller coaster that's worth coming to.
[16:29.35]That's it?
[16:38.56]Wait a minute.
[16:41.44]That's it.
[16:44.38]So this just is a children's game.
[16:46.27]Where are the scary rides?
[16:51.21]The Viking ship is not scary.
[16:54.21]It'll make you sick, but it's not scary.
[16:58.36]You're telling me Wild Strawberry is the best ride that this game has?
[17:02.84]I don't believe that for a second.
[17:06.68]Utility structures?
[17:08.04]It's like all the way down here, is it?
[17:10.53]Oh boy.
[17:14.20]Alright, are we stable?
[17:16.46]Is our internet actually stable?
[17:17.76]Can I start Metro, please?
[17:25.52]I think, okay, I think we're okay.
[17:26.66]Let's see, let's see if I can start Metro.
[17:33.21]It's been 20 minutes and it's been alright so far.
[17:36.49]Watch me say that and all of a sudden it's gonna die.
[17:38.21]Alright, let's do it, let's do Metro.
[17:41.23]See if we can get it to go.
