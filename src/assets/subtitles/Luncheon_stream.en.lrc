[ve:60.16.100]

[03:48.84]Fucking dumped it all over me.
[03:50.02]Great.
[03:51.20]Hi.
[03:51.54]Hey.
[03:52.34]How are you?
[03:52.90]Welcome, guys.
[03:55.62]Fucking napkin.
[04:01.51]Starting soon.
[04:02.25]Don't you guys know?
[04:02.99]Come on.
[04:15.55]Alright.
[04:16.67]Gonna play Overwatch.
[04:31.76]Now you can see.
[04:39.27]Why are all the emoticons celestial bodies?
[04:43.51]Why not?
[04:46.27]I don't have an answer for you.
[04:47.53]I don't really don't.
[04:54.08]We're going to play some Overwatch.
[04:56.52]And I don't know.
[04:58.98]Before I get hungry enough to eat lunch.
[05:02.36]If that makes any sense.
[05:07.10]Wait, what?
[05:10.86]Sab 3600.
[05:13.44]Thank you for two months in a row.
[05:19.40]Very much so.
[05:23.86]I will play Zenyatta.
[05:27.62]Wait, what?
[05:30.13]Left side of town.
[05:32.93]With the three months, two months, then three months, can we make it four months?
[05:35.51]Did I have fun with the baguette yesterday?
[05:40.92]We don't talk about the baguette.
[05:45.02]We don't talk about baguette issues.
[05:46.38]Of which I have none, by the way.
[05:54.10]I think we're playing on my favorite map to start.
[06:03.15]Aww.
[06:04.61]I think we might be getting beat here.
[06:11.63]Well, I might have to switch off of Zenyatta.
[06:18.14]Oh, Lord.
[06:19.50]No!
[06:21.02]Where's the team?
[06:22.14]Where's the team?
[06:27.08]I'm going to lose you.
[06:34.14]What's my social security number?
[06:35.52]2-2-2.
[06:38.98]2-2-2-2.
[06:41.58]45-5-6-8.
[06:42.36]Is that 8?
[06:48.42]What's going on here?
[06:49.98]I need to heal anybody right now.
[06:57.53]I don't care who it is.
[07:08.25]Wow.
[07:11.41]Too many numbers.
[07:16.26]I think that's actually too long to be a social.
[07:19.92]Pretty certain.
[07:25.38]Kinda just getting slam dunked on right now.
[07:27.10]Wish I had one of those.
[07:33.65]Those ultimate attacks that I keep hearing so much about in this game.
[07:43.74]Has anybody died on their team?
[07:50.74]I have zero eliminations.
[08:00.29]Don't get space jammed.
[08:01.19]It's too late.
[08:01.69]We're about to get flawlessed.
[08:04.59]Takes three games.
[08:05.59]Remember?
[08:07.11]We had this conversation yesterday.
[08:08.07]It takes three games before you're allowed to play video games.
[08:14.48]How are we going to get it?
[08:16.50]Oh, you fatso.
[08:17.62]You couldn't get that for me?
[08:20.58]Did I save anybody's life?
[08:28.97]Enough to potentially have us not lose in flawless fashion.
[08:40.14]Special request Saturday?
[08:41.32]What's the special request?
[08:45.67]You guys want to know how big my chest is?
[08:50.60]What?
[08:52.04]Why do you want to know that?
[08:52.86]I don't even know.
[08:55.00]I haven't measured.
[08:55.62]I thought that was an animated spray.
[09:06.51]Hmm.
[09:08.59]I will stay with you.
[09:20.84]We need to know.
[09:23.50]Wait, what?
[09:28.40]Nearly moved.
[09:30.10]I called it.
[09:30.90]I knew it was going to happen.
[09:33.82]The only lemon.
[09:37.72]Thanks a lot, dude.
[09:39.30]Welcome back.
[09:39.90]Two months.
[09:41.88]I love you.
[09:44.56]I never know what to say.
[09:46.50]It's always, like, so odd.
[09:47.50]I'm just like, oh, thanks, welcome.
[09:50.02]Hey, thanks a lot.
[09:51.50]I fucking like you, man.
[09:52.68]Thank you.
[09:57.41]But, anyways, it's really thank you to anybody that subscribes to this channel.
[10:04.89]Too fast for you.
[10:09.76]Ooh, almost.
[10:10.64]Almost got me there.
[10:12.08]Almost got me there.
[10:21.06]Help.
[10:22.74]Double help.
[10:23.48]Triple help.
[10:24.04]Any kind of help.
[10:26.24]See ya.
[10:28.09]Oh, thank god.
[10:30.23]I thought she was gonna fly.
[10:37.65]Step in the line of sight so I can heal you.
[10:41.95]See, now we're flawlessing.
[10:43.95]How does that work?
[10:56.34]Did you see the gun?
[10:58.08]The gun was trying so badly to do the ult.
[11:03.56]Middlemans.
[11:04.16]Thanks a lot.
[11:06.20]Oh.
[11:10.22]And Builderbro.
[11:12.35]Builderbro and Middlemans.
[11:13.63]Thanks for the resub.
[11:14.49]And the first sub.
[11:17.17]Both of you guys.
[11:25.22]Maybe I should just ult.
[11:27.68]When I see somebody turn the corner, I'm gonna hit the button.
[11:29.96]No!
[11:31.48]No!
[11:43.33]Thank god I still have it.
[11:46.67]Thank god I still have it.
[11:47.61]Okay, we won.
[11:56.87]I dropped the beat all the way down to the center of the earth.
[12:09.80]What makes this game so much fun?
[12:10.78]I've been playing it for a bit and I reached rank 15, but it just seems repetitive and boring.
[12:17.90]I don't know.
[12:19.51]It's fun.
[12:22.45]I like the different playstyles.
[12:27.09]You can change characters in this game and play a completely different game.
[12:32.79]There's like four ways to support.
[12:34.47]No, even more than that.
[12:35.25]There's like nine ways to support in this game.
[12:38.75]There's like 15 different ways to go any kind of off.
[12:41.37]It's just... I don't know.
[12:42.95]There's a lot to it in regards to the characters.
[12:45.97]Although I can't agree that it is kind of just like, jump in a game, jump on a map, and then take it easy.
[12:51.63]See you later.
[12:52.05]Jump in a game, go on a new map, take it easy.
[12:53.87]Jump in a game, matchmaking, matchmaking, matchmaking, bye, bye, bye.
[12:58.34]But it is still beta, right?
[13:00.26]This is still an open beta.
[13:01.72]They don't even have a ranked queue right now.
[13:02.92]So until they add these things, and potentially like a browser, potentially just queue up for certain maps you like to play, or different game modes, and
[13:14.85]I'm enjoying it, though.
[13:16.55]That is for certain.
[13:18.19]I wouldn't be playing it as much as I was if I didn't.
[13:23.54]He just dodged and hit me.
[13:24.78]It was bullshit.
[13:35.09]It's not really a beta, it's a demo.
[13:39.09]Technically, I guess, yeah.
[13:45.95]I think I get killed by this Tracer.
[13:51.75]They have two Tracers?
[13:55.52]I think they do.
[14:02.72]Counter Lucio ult, huh?
[14:05.94]Shit.
[14:22.35]I mean, it's nice that they're doing this, though.
[14:25.51]Say whatever you want about Blizzard and say whatever you want about the game, the fact that they're allowing literally anyone on Earth to try to play this game right now for free when the game is actually 40 bucks is pretty cool because you actually can tell if you actually want to buy it.
[14:41.49]You don't have to second-guess yourself or anything.
[14:44.31]You can make a purchase you may have not wanted to make or maybe you got pushed over the fence by playing this weekend.
[14:51.14]It's a cool idea.
[14:54.51]Kinda getting dunked on right now.
[15:06.48]Wait a minute.
[15:13.91]Am I gonna play with viewers?
[15:17.15]Uh... I don't know.
[15:20.23]I gotta think of logistically how I could do that.
[15:24.49]And not have it be like a total mess.
[15:40.02]Always upvote the Roadhog.
[15:42.08]As a fellow Roadhog player.
[15:43.88]I will always upvote you.
[16:04.03]I think it's worth 40 bucks, I do.
[16:07.63]Let's put it this way, if Titanfall was 60, this is worth 40.
[16:18.39]Titanfall, god.
[16:21.34]Fucking Titanfall.
[16:27.02]That game was fun for like a total of 19 minutes.
[16:36.16]We got a lot of offense already.
[16:39.82]Maybe I'll play some... Still need to support.
[16:44.13]I'll play Zenyatta this time.
[16:46.81]Maybe we can actually do something worth talking about.
[16:49.41]Does anybody play Titanfall?
[16:57.22]I don't think so.
[16:58.40]I really don't.
[17:03.06]I think you can do my job.
[17:05.61]Isn't Titanfall 2 coming out?
[17:06.79]Didn't they announce Titanfall 2?
[17:09.13]I'm not sure what you'd put in Titanfall 2 to make Titanfall interesting to play.
[17:24.78]I didn't like Titanfall because Titanfall was like a pretend FPS.
[17:29.74]You would just shoot at bots and think you were killing people.
[17:35.95]Oh wow, I just wanted like a triple kill.
[17:37.37]No, you just killed three AI characters that were just brainless idiots.
[17:42.23]Congratulations.
[17:59.07]Put it on the monkey.
[18:07.01]Do they have a Widowmaker?
[18:07.73]If they do, I'm in trouble.
[18:17.43]Oh, I couldn't get it on you.
[18:26.01]Open your mind.
[18:27.71]Watch out!
[18:29.27]Wow, just missed me.
[18:39.18]Hey.
[18:39.62]Hey.
[18:39.72]Got him right in the head.
[18:44.28]I just shocked that guy.
[18:45.30]I got him right in his brain.
[18:48.60]Watch.
[18:48.80]Ready?
[18:48.98]One, two, three.
[18:50.79]See?
[18:51.07]I died.
[18:51.37]That was me counting down to be dying.
[18:55.49]That dodge.
[18:56.85]Did you see that?
[19:05.73]I gave you rabies.
[19:06.67]You got me.
[19:08.67]You got me.
[19:09.23]You got me with the can.
[19:11.99]Thanks a lot, dude.
[19:14.54]Wow.
[19:17.06]I'd love to heal you.
[19:17.84]You're just never in line.
[19:21.94]Welcome to the... Shit stains.
[19:29.70]Welcome to the 45 percentile.
[19:33.36]How many of you guys are at 45% right now?
[19:34.78]I'm gonna get killed.
[19:39.58]I didn't even believe in myself.
[19:40.64]I didn't get killed.
[19:41.72]I killed that guy.
[19:54.45]I think I might have gotten sniped.
[19:56.11]What's going on, L?
[20:02.84]Long time no see, dude.
[20:04.44]You been playing Overwatch?
[20:16.55]It's pretty fun.
[20:18.17]It's pretty cool.
[20:20.73]Please don't kill any ducks?
[20:22.02]What?
[20:23.56]Ducks?
[20:25.00]What are you talking about?
[20:25.92]I need to get into voice chat and just start screaming at people.
[20:30.58]What do you think?
[20:30.94]Should I start yelling at people in chat?
[20:35.52]Get on the point, you fucking idiots.
[20:38.35]I have an ultimate.
[20:40.85]I'm gonna do it in a second.
[20:55.40]You played it for the first time a couple days ago, liked what you saw.
[20:57.57]Hold on a second.
[21:14.21]I have an ult if you guys want to use it.
[21:21.51]You guys ready?
[21:21.91]Push in with me, okay?
[21:22.71]3, 2, 1, let's go.
[21:35.65]Get on the point.
[21:47.34]Where did they all come from?
[21:49.60]Where the fuck did all those people come from?
[21:54.64]The whole team was behind me.
[21:55.54]Bullshit.
[22:01.40]Okay, um... Should I go Lucio?
[22:04.56]Will that help the team?
[22:24.40]I'm just 1v1'ing fucking RoHog.
[22:26.36]Ugh!
[22:32.48]I would have put that on a... I would have placked that.
[22:34.78]You know what I'm saying?
[22:39.80]Is that actually you, Jerma?
[22:42.32]What?
[22:46.35]Who's that?
[22:47.01]I don't even like that guy.
[22:55.39]Ski around the bell.
[22:56.43]Just ski around the bell.
[22:57.23]Nobody will hit you.
[23:02.17]That Roadhog didn't even left-click first.
[23:17.90]Maybe we gave it our all.
[23:20.36]Nice try, though, guys.
[23:29.13]Just do that and explode on somebody.
[23:30.77]Just explode.
[23:35.28]Sure if it's caught in chat.
[23:37.34]Nah, whatever.
[23:40.03]That guy hit some people.
[23:40.97]I'll give him a vote.
[23:41.65]Why not?
[23:43.53]Sure thing.
[23:58.24]What's up with this belly button?
[23:59.38]What?
[23:59.56]You can see my belly button?
[24:00.40]What are you talking about?
[24:01.44]I have a perfectly normal belly button.
[24:07.50]Alright, what do you guys think?
[24:08.26]Innie or outie?
[24:09.84]Anybody know?
[24:11.96]Anybody have an idea?
[24:15.90]Is anybody... Who gets it?
[24:17.22]Who's gonna get the right answer?
[24:20.30]Just kidding.
[24:20.70]It's fucking sealed.
[24:21.68]I don't even have one.
[24:26.54]I'm like a Ken doll.
[24:29.74]No, wait a second.
[24:30.74]Wait a second, no.
[24:32.52]That's not... If you go lower than the belly button, I'm not a Ken doll.
[24:36.22]But I'm a Ken doll in the sense that there's a... I don't have a... There's like a plate on my stomach, right?
[24:40.98]Alright, we're gonna road it up.
[24:46.29]You fucking mutant.
[24:52.65]Clone, there's like a hundred of us.
[24:54.27]I know.
[24:57.30]You know how many of this there are?
[24:58.18]You know how many clones have died?
[25:02.28]I'm clone number like 48.
[25:03.62]I woke up this morning.
[25:07.36]I was genetically enhanced and modified.
[25:09.12]To age.
[25:12.32]To 26.
[25:12.72]I'm not even close to 30.
[25:13.82]I'm 26.
[25:14.02]Ken doll.
[25:26.71]I was talking about Roadhog's belly button.
[25:28.71]Well... Yeah, he's got one.
[25:33.07]It's a super rowdy.
[25:40.38]What the fuck does that mean?
[25:42.62]Jerma's tomato sauce mom?
[25:45.94]What does that mean?
[25:50.14]You're my mother made out of tomato sauce?
[25:52.24]That's kind of weird.
[25:54.06]Anyways, thank you.
[25:54.68]Hi.
[25:54.86]Let's try to get a good game here as the dog.
[25:58.58]As the road dog.
[26:00.24]As the bog dog.
[26:02.30]As the clown dog.
[26:03.20]Clown frog.
[26:10.54]Pardon me.
[26:38.11]Goodbye.
[26:40.49]Ah, Genji.
[26:44.74]Push it in.
[26:45.14]I'm going to get that Genji when he jumps.
[26:48.36]We could just go in.
[26:48.96]Not a bad time to go in.
[26:57.95]Oh, I didn't have anything to shoot at you!
[27:01.61]I didn't have anything to shoot at you, otherwise I would have been fine.
[27:07.33]Opinion on Zarya?
[27:08.39]I hate her.
[27:10.19]Hate to play against her, hate to play as her.
[27:11.74]I think Zarya and Widowmaker are my two least favorite characters in the game.
[27:18.74]Widowmaker takes the cake.
[27:20.38]By a long shot though.
[27:22.50]A very long, long shot.
[27:31.15]Remember that time, German?
[27:32.15]I never did that.
[27:34.68]I never did that.
[27:39.70]Well, it's time to shine.
[27:41.40]It's time to shine right here.
[27:48.45]I killed two big guys.
[27:49.35]I hope that helps.
[28:03.14]What does BAMF stand for?
[28:04.44]I believe it stands for Badass Motherfucker.
[28:10.36]I think.
[28:14.10]We all swore an oath that day.
[28:23.07]We're still contesting it.
[28:27.61]Aye, aye, aye.
[28:28.87]I'm in trouble.
[28:31.95]Couldn't get out there fast enough.
[28:34.42]Quarter for the language jar.
[28:35.54]Yeah.
[28:39.38]More vacation vlogs?
[28:40.84]No.
[28:41.16]I really need to go on vacation though.
[28:44.86]I need to just decompress somewhere for like a fucking month.
[28:50.51]I'm just gonna go to a cave.
[28:52.47]No internet, no phone, nothing.
[28:54.63]I'm just gonna live out my days eating like fucking snails.
[28:57.41]You know what I'm saying?
[29:00.29]I'm gonna be a real snail eater soon enough.
[29:06.95]be like the troll under the bridge eventually someone's gonna come across me and I'm gonna be like who's that who's there and I'm gonna come out I'll have to answer a couple of questions around town I'm gonna kill them too
[29:36.60]He's kind of busy just talking about eating snails.
[29:39.40]I'll have a huge beard.
[29:47.57]Beard?
[29:47.95]I said that really weirdly.
[29:50.45]I'll have a huge beard.
[30:01.77]I should get interviewed on TV for what?
[30:08.53]Biggest loser.
[30:10.43]World's biggest loser.
[30:13.65]Like, yeah, I go on biggest loser.
[30:16.52]I don't need to lose any weight.
[30:17.48]They just get me on there because they're like, look, I don't know if you can enter this competition.
[30:21.10]You are the biggest loser.
[30:23.60]You can lose 100 pounds.
[30:24.74]You can gain 100 pounds.
[30:26.12]We only brought you here to make fun of you because you are the biggest loser.
[30:30.62]The guy that's like 900 pounds looks over and is like, yeah, what a fucking idiot.
[30:34.97]They do like a cut close up to my face.
[30:36.77]Tears are just streaming down my face.
[30:39.35]I didn't kill her.
[30:51.19]You tried to fly.
[30:51.97]You did fly, unfortunately.
[30:59.28]Just barely off.
[31:01.46]Gee, don't worry, Geronimo.
[31:05.44]Oh, dragon.
[31:06.28]Don't.
[31:06.78]Don't.
[31:07.58]Please, get out of my eyes.
[31:16.46]Ow.
[31:19.48]Oh, shit.
[31:20.88]Come on.
[31:21.40]Don't do this to me.
[31:24.70]You're the one I wanted to grab and I got you.
[31:35.34]I don't know.
[31:38.08]It's a good question.
[31:44.27]You seem to be having confidence.
[31:45.49]No, I'm just fucking around.
[31:49.41]I'm alright.
[31:49.85]I'm good to go.
[31:58.96]This Widowmaker is so dead.
[32:00.74]I told you.
[32:17.71]Jerma's dead inside.
[32:19.15]No, I'm undead.
[32:24.16]I've been brought back.
[32:27.58]For reasons unknown.
[32:28.74]I've been brought back.
[32:30.12]I'm pretty much...
[32:32.88]Was it King Arthas?
[32:33.58]Is it the Lich King?
[32:36.34]No, Lich King never died.
[32:37.58]Who's back?
[32:41.97]I could just kill him, but I'm scared he's going to charge me.
[33:09.69]80% hook accuracy right now.
[33:10.92]I feel like I'm not really doing much, though.
[33:13.24]I'm unkindled.
[33:13.88]There you go.
[33:14.18]I'm a Dark Souls character.
[33:15.18]That's good.
[33:30.85]Didn't want to shoot the Genji he was reflecting.
[33:32.63]He just insta-killed me.
[33:39.89]We still haven't lost, I don't know how.
[33:47.23]Alright, that was game number three, right?
[33:52.44]Takes three games.
[34:06.42]Dark Souls.
[34:14.06]Oh yeah, I put the lipstick on the tweet I made.
[34:18.30]I forgot.
[34:18.80]I did a lot of damage too.
[34:22.86]Was I actually doing anything?
[34:27.54]Sometimes you vote for yourself.
[34:35.46]I'm going to open that box.
[34:49.90]Where's my box?
[34:50.40]Come on.
[34:57.24]Money, huh?
[34:58.56]Ooh.
[35:01.91]Poses.
[35:04.63]Blue skin.
[35:08.37]I'll take it all.
[35:09.53]I will take it all.
[35:16.90]Money.
[35:23.64]Hey, cash is king, right?
[35:29.18]Favorite Roadhog skin is the... Shark head one.
[35:36.96]Definitely.
[35:49.80]Let's open up a door cube.
[35:55.90]Why do I hate Widowmaker?
[35:58.16]Because... I don't know.
[36:01.58]She can be so far away and shoot so rapidly and do so much damage.
[36:07.25]I feel like if you have even the slightest bit of skill with that character, you can just wreck entire lobbies.
[36:18.32]That's why.
[36:22.36]I just turned into a...
[36:25.41]Ragdoll.
[36:26.03]Let's watch that again.
[36:27.99]Let's see that again in slow motion.
[36:33.48]Bastion's good.
[36:35.86]He's very hard to pull the trigger on and use in any situation, though.
[36:41.92]I feel like there's only a handful of times I've said, you know, I kind of want to play Bastion right now.
[36:46.88]Hasn't really happened that often.
[36:49.12]But when it does happen, you do pretty well.
[37:05.98]Wait, we're actually in a game.
[37:11.26]There were no players here.
[37:14.32]What the hell was that?
[37:14.86]I thought we were in a waiting for game lobby.
[37:17.53]Okay, I'm gonna play now.
[37:19.72]Seriously thought we both had like three players on the team and we were waiting for a game to start or something That's how non-existent this whole thing was I'm gonna come get you
[37:49.21]Step in it!
[37:50.37]Step in it!
[37:56.83]She stepped in it.
[37:57.61]That guy just destroyed me.
[38:11.34]Wasn't hitting any directs on him at all.
[38:23.71]Didn't make it Haven't played Junkrat in a while my directs are not gonna be very good.
[38:38.87]I don't think In fact
[38:51.01]I need to change.
[38:53.75]It's not working right now on this character, for sure.
[39:07.64]What did I kill?
[39:15.82]He was all over us.
[39:36.68]I come back just to somebody dying on me yeah I'll play the pH
[40:02.87]Let's play the video game now.
[40:07.17]Did that guy really just kill me that quickly?
[40:18.78]Kevin.
[40:20.74]Did Kevin really just kill me in two seconds?
[40:35.38]Kevin.
[40:37.50]Get out of here, Kevin.
[40:46.14]I'm coming for you, Kevin.
[40:56.76]There's another Kevin?
[40:58.91]How can there be two Kevins?
[41:09.36]Doesn't make any sense.
[41:23.53]No, your shield!
[41:24.65]Not fair!
[41:25.23]I hate you, Zarya.
[41:27.53]Fuck you.
[41:28.01]I will not fail again.
[41:41.12]What do I think of McCree?
[41:43.40]He's... If you can aim, he's probably one of the best offensive characters in the game.
[42:04.48]It's so hard to deal with a fucking Zarya.
[42:08.93]I know, Rubber Psycho.
[42:11.13]Zarya never dies.
[42:14.09]Even if you think you're gonna kill Zarya, she's just gonna shield and then she'll kill you because you're gonna make her do more damage.
[42:23.10]Game sucks.
[42:25.94]But thanks, Rubber Psycho.
[42:26.84]Appreciate it.
[42:28.96]Oh, fuck me.
[42:46.17]I'm gonna rage switch again.
[42:47.37]Late.
[42:51.89]Just for fun.
[43:01.29]Sorry, I killed you.
[43:03.46]Yeah, I believe you did.
[43:04.82]Alright, I'm gonna popsicle these motherfuckers right now.
[43:11.22]You ready?
[43:15.86]Get blue, Popsicle.
[43:20.10]Give me health.
[43:32.48]Give me health.
[43:43.60]Touch it.
[43:55.91]It's too much.
[43:57.61]It's too much.
[44:00.63]Too many.
[44:05.55]We didn't win.
[44:08.78]Crap.
[44:09.86]Oh, crap.
[44:18.02]Just Kevin?
[44:18.60]No.
[44:19.52]Different guy.
[44:24.28]Bernie.
[44:26.46]Hi.
[44:28.35]I kicked your ass that game.
[44:31.29]Yeah, you and your fucking never-die Zarya and Kevin, the fucking guy with 38 eliminations.
[44:38.92]I joined the game when it was over time.
[44:42.81]Someone left their team.
[44:44.75]Sometimes you upvote a guy named Kevin because he had 50% kill participation.
[44:50.67]Okay.
[44:51.69]Sometimes you do that.
[44:52.87]Sometimes you do that.
[44:53.73]Do you want to play together?
[44:55.33]Is that what you're trying to do?
[44:58.73]We are playing together.
[44:59.67]No, I'm not playing.
[45:02.55]Let's just queue up like regular humans.
[45:07.13]We're playing together.
[45:08.87]Just accept my invite.
[45:11.15]But... Where did you go?
[45:14.27]I said leave the game so we can just queue into a game together.
[45:17.81]Me and Kev could have killed you.
[45:19.87]No, I am not playing in another game with Kevin, okay?
[45:24.55]What?
[45:25.65]Dude, one friend just had a baby on my stream.
[45:27.67]Nice avatar.
[45:29.47]Thanks.
[45:30.28]Nice.
[45:30.50]Oh, you've got, like, the Mercedes Benz.
[45:32.14]Yeah, I got the steering wheel.
[45:33.42]I got the Transformers steering wheel.
[45:36.06]Fucking way better than yours.
[45:38.34]What are you doing today?
[45:41.82]How are you?
[45:43.32]I'm okay.
[45:44.36]Like, I was going to turn my stream on at probably the exact moment as your stream, but I couldn't find my sweater.
[45:50.21]And I had to wear a sweater, otherwise I would have cried.
[45:52.67]Huh.
[45:55.32]Well, some days you just got to sweat it, you know?
[45:58.29]Are you streaming right now?
[45:59.97]I am.
[46:01.09]Well, I want to see his perspective.
[46:03.39]I'll go open it.
[46:03.97]I want to see my perspective, which is, you know, I'm more inclined to tell you to stick around here, but, you know, it's all right.
[46:10.82]You choose.
[46:11.40]I mean, you don't have to stick around there.
[46:13.11]Nah, you don't have to stick.
[46:14.43]Go watch Star.
[46:15.05]He's, you know, go stick around over there.
[46:16.17]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[46:17.31]Jerma's like, wait, like, please go watch.
[46:19.01]No, you see, like, but he's such a good guy, like... No, listen.
[46:22.59]Head on over to that stream.
[46:24.55]It was really... You saved my life, man.
[46:31.68]I wasn't even a twinkle in my father's eye in, like, the 60s or 70s.
[46:37.18]When was Vietnam?
[46:39.24]I think it was, like, the 1910.
[46:40.42]Wait, what?
[46:48.34]But Kev's on the other team.
[46:50.42]People are leaving.
[46:51.00]Don't leave.
[46:51.37]I need you guys right now.
[46:52.75]I need you guys right now.
[46:55.67]I'm in a bad spot.
[46:56.53]I need you guys.
[46:59.61]I need you.
[47:04.32]My stream goes down to like 100 viewers.
[47:12.90]I'm so lost.
[47:15.96]I see guidance.
[47:17.72]What does that say?
[47:19.04]What?
[47:19.64]Getting that as a tattoo.
[47:22.62]That's going to be a tattoo right across my arm.
[47:27.24]Are you talking in voice chat too?
[47:36.42]I'm talking in your chat.
[47:39.13]The only communication I'm going to do is through your text chat for your stream.
[47:47.55]Funny guy.
[47:52.70]And by that I mean, I haven't done anything so far.
[47:57.42]Okay, now I'm doing.
[47:59.78]I hit one guy.
[48:01.54]Okay, I did a little bit.
[48:03.60]I did silver.
[48:05.21]I showed up late and I did the silver.
[48:07.19]I want to play Genji and I want to learn Genji, but there's always a Genji.
[48:10.11]You ever get that feeling that there's always a Genji?
[48:13.39]I want to learn another character, but
[48:16.42]I'm too embarrassed to play him on stream because it would be embarrassing.
[48:19.20]That's why I never play Genji.
[48:21.18]Genji's still the one character that I feel embarrassed on.
[48:26.12]Didn't hit him with any of that.
[48:27.85]I am so embarrassed.
[48:28.73]See what I'm talking about?
[48:29.39]Get it away from me!
[48:35.23]Fuck.
[48:36.21]I fucking hate it.
[48:37.61]I hate it.
[48:39.41]What am I gonna do?
[48:41.11]I gotta change.
[48:42.27]I gotta change back to Roadhog and win games.
[48:46.60]You should do it.
[48:47.28]You should do it.
[48:49.86]The only way you're ever gonna win.
[48:51.86]Better Mix Master, thanks, man.
[48:53.63]Welcome back.
[48:53.89]You play the fucking, like, elephant hook character.
[48:57.33]Hey, he's fun.
[49:03.01]I need to play, like, a Kree right here.
[49:05.39]You know what would be a good character right here at Jerma is the one you're playing.
[49:08.82]Oh, well, do play him.
[49:10.06]I'm fucking, I'm going to Roadhog.
[49:21.52]Wow, he got, he got slammed.
[49:24.85]Jeremiah's tomato sauce mom subbed to me.
[49:27.15]Yeah, he subbed to me too.
[49:28.39]I don't know what that means.
[49:29.75]Well, yesterday was my orange mom.
[49:31.89]Oh.
[49:32.09]I was trying to figure that one out.
[49:36.65]I don't know why your mom's tomato sauce mom.
[49:39.11]I don't know.
[49:40.12]But if she's really good at making tomato sauce, that's a skill and we should be proud.
[49:43.28]Cool.
[49:46.09]You know what I'm talking about?
[49:46.79]You know what I'm talking about when I say a skill?
[49:49.21]Yeah.
[49:51.11]Like you're talking cooking.
[49:53.85]Fishing.
[49:54.15]Cleaning.
[49:56.25]Blacksmithing.
[49:56.77]Is your mother a blacksmith?
[49:59.98]I don't know.
[50:01.60]Probably not.
[50:02.26]Not that I know of.
[50:07.34]No, I don't think I like Hanzo on this map.
[50:10.42]A little too far.
[50:21.28]tomato sauce.
[50:24.86]When was the last time you opened a can of tomato sauce?
[50:30.43]But I can actually tell you that I did buy some tomato sauce to make homemade pizzas.
[50:34.79]Nice.
[50:35.67]Very nice.
[50:36.17]Three months ago.
[50:49.11]I can't see anything.
[50:50.33]I hope this is played again.
[50:53.17]It might be.
[50:53.85]Oh my god, that's going to be so funny.
[50:54.81]That's going to be hilarious.
[50:57.13]Oh, from your perspective?
[50:58.45]Yes.
[50:59.47]I was blind.
[51:02.39]I was fucking blind, dude.
[51:32.19]Right out of the injector seat.
[51:34.59]Right out of the injector seat.
[51:37.07]Oh, that was a slow-mo, too.
[51:38.79]Slow that down.
[51:39.57]How are you feeling today?
[51:42.11]You sound like you're pretty happy with your life.
[51:45.31]Things are all right.
[51:47.51]Hey, you just take every day as it comes, right?
[51:51.57]I don't know about that.
[51:52.51]I don't know about that.
[51:54.55]Hey, I'm gonna get that as a fucking tattoo.
[51:57.21]I'm gonna get that tattooed across my arm.
[52:02.46]No, that.
[52:03.32]Whatever that says.
[52:03.94]I sneezed.
[52:10.66]Yeah, you missed my sneeze.
[52:12.84]Did you have a big one?
[52:14.29]Yeah.
[52:21.61]I mean, you're probably pretty upset that you missed it.
[52:23.33]You're a big sneeze enthusiast.
[52:25.77]I love sneezing.
[52:28.16]Especially when it's a big, loud one.
[52:34.26]Oh, it says Nepal.
[52:35.42]Okay.
[52:35.88]Well, apparently that's what I'm getting tattooed on me.
[52:40.62]Oh, wow.
[52:40.86]That... No!
[52:44.88]Thor!
[52:46.24]Whoa.
[52:47.22]I was not paying attention to that.
[52:48.22]I thought that was a Lucio.
[52:50.08]That was such an impossible fight to win, and I was so happy I almost won.
[52:53.52]Start over at the beginning, Derma.
[53:00.79]Where it all began?
[53:02.19]Where it all began.
[53:03.07]Where did it begin?
[53:05.85]Back.
[53:06.05]Do you know?
[53:09.31]No.
[53:10.39]I do.
[53:10.59]That's just what McCree said.
[53:12.27]So it probably was about the bridge.
[53:16.89]I got a couple of guys.
[53:19.36]You like jumped off the map.
[53:28.45]Why did I peek my head?
[53:29.67]I thought he was walking up the stairs.
[53:30.99]And I was just like, I'm going to flashbang this kiddo.
[53:35.47]And I insta-died.
[53:39.12]I'm just trying to keep him off.
[53:46.88]Yeah, I'm not doing... I'm doing alright.
[53:50.96]I've killed some dudes.
[53:52.90]Do you remember you're really good at Roadhog?
[54:01.18]It's one of the only characters I can play in this game.
[54:08.38]We'll then take the con... Whoa!
[54:12.04]Where's the callout?
[54:12.66]You didn't warn me that there was an entire 10 there.
[54:15.70]An entire 10.
[54:16.80]Yeah, there was an entire 10.
[54:19.00]Hold on.
[54:20.64]I can't talk.
[54:23.73]Talking makes me lose.
[54:28.51]Like, we're doing that already.
[54:32.15]Holy shit.
[54:40.08]Why did they just drop the beat?
[54:42.08]I don't know.
[54:43.94]How do we have so many people on fire but we can't cap this at all?
[54:49.06]76s are actually locking it down pretty well on this side.
[54:51.26]Stay away from the sights.
[55:07.23]They're really stepping on a fucking trap.
[55:08.69]I... I am going to scream.
[55:11.81]Why?
[55:12.51]We're even.
[55:13.41]It's a good match.
[55:15.12]I just... I didn't even... I stepped on a fucking trap.
[55:21.02]Ugh.
[55:21.62]Look at that.
[55:23.38]Is it too on?
[55:27.52]Um... Who wins the game?
[55:30.52]I don't know.
[55:36.42]I don't know.
[55:44.40]Widow hits it the perfect way.
[55:48.25]Playing Widowmaker.
[55:48.99]Wow.
[55:51.45]Wow.
[55:51.85]It's like one of those people that play Widowmaker every game.
[55:54.41]And I'm like so sick.
[55:55.01]Why don't you just play a different character?
[55:56.19]Hi, I'm on Roadhog.
[55:56.89]Why don't you play a different character?
[56:06.60]No way.
[56:08.88]Where the fuck did he come from?
[56:12.72]Sit down.
[56:22.12]Fuck.
[56:22.28]What killed me that fast?
[56:25.57]What was it?
[56:27.55]What was it?
[56:29.91]What did... There was a cheat code going on.
[56:32.95]Me losing health every second.
[56:36.55]Um... What?
[56:39.16]It was a cheat because somebody put a code in.
[56:42.12]Eva, don't go alone.
[56:45.64]I know you're a tank and all, but you're scaring me.
[56:49.24]Do you have the bastion that's over here?
[56:51.42]God damn it.
[57:01.10]Grrrr.
[57:03.32]Watch out for that Bastion that's over there.
[57:05.00]No, I pulled him.
[57:05.64]He's just getting shot over and over again by the Hanzo.
[57:08.54]I bet Lucio's dead.
[57:20.55]He could probably get it.
[57:31.40]Yeah, I think we can take the point if I kill everyone.
[57:33.92]You know what I'm saying?
[57:35.22]We're fine.
[57:43.12]Yeah.
[57:45.20]Yeah, we are.
[57:50.11]Ah, he went behind me.
[57:51.25]He went behind me!
[57:52.11]Why does it have to keep happening to me?
[58:13.78]Watch out for the drags.
[58:20.60]I know I know Watch out don't get squashed whoa my muscle my muscles My muscles weren't good enough for that one
[58:40.33]I actually was trying- I was trying to pull the Bastion but the fucking Roadhog got in the way and I pulled him and killed him.
[58:46.05]Eh, hold on.
[58:52.73]What happened?
[59:05.20]You shitty.
[59:06.36]You shitty, Jerma.
[59:07.96]Get better.
[59:18.09]Nobody here.
[59:19.41]Sure, I'll take it.
[59:30.23]And away we go.
[59:32.33]I got a win.
[59:35.56]Winning is good.
[59:36.78]This is the win condition right here.
[59:39.70]Watch out for that Bastion, man.
[59:41.62]Or is he right?
[59:42.06]Hey, I'll get him.
[59:46.36]Never mind.
[59:49.82]Behind you, Tracer.
[60:00.95]That Reinhardt needs one hit.

[60:53.19]You're like fucking somebody else's plan.
[60:57.19]I would have had a card.
[60:58.01]If I killed the two more people, the three more people right there, but instead of you stealing them from me with your dragon, I would have had that card.
[61:04.79]Yeah.
[61:05.53]You don't even know what happened because you couldn't see anything.
[61:11.31]I had... I knew exactly what happened.

[61:47.51]This is not PJ Salt.
[61:48.55]You're on Twitch TV.
[61:49.63]This is definitely PJ Salt.
[61:51.15]No, it's not.
[61:52.17]This is, uh... My favorite part of the stream is when I think PJ Salt, but not quite sure.
[62:00.47]Then I ask, and then I find out.
[62:03.87]Is that referencing something in particular?
[62:06.72]No.
[62:14.07]Salty now man the streamer over here is a little salty this morning.

[63:03.35]Never mind.
[63:04.83]No, it's just that I don't want to crunch it.
[63:07.21]I want it to last longer.
[63:10.09]Oh, my tooth!
[63:17.73]Your teeth all just break like, oh fuck!
[63:22.48]I don't get the joke.
[63:23.80]There is no joke.
[63:25.08]Don't worry.
[63:25.36]Can you explain it to me?
[63:26.52]No.
[63:29.42]Hey, German, could you play Roadhog for a bit this round?
[63:32.19]Yeah!
[63:33.35]I'll do that.
[63:34.13]I can do that.
[63:34.61]These are the new comics.

[63:56.30]I don't know who the fuck that is.
[63:57.56]I don't follow Starbound.
[63:59.36]Yeah.
[64:03.16]What's up with the development with that game anyway, Starbound?
[64:05.72]They've never released it.
[64:06.58]I don't know.
[64:07.22]Okay, that's a marine under there, right?
[64:08.96]Space marine.
[64:12.21]Yeah.
[64:13.25]I don't fucking believe Starcraft.
[64:16.45]What was that game, Stardew Valley?
[64:29.77]This took a lot of damage.
[64:31.51]I'm so hurt.
[64:35.63]Break her out of it, come on!
[64:36.37]Okay, yeah, I'm definitely lagging.
[64:40.22]What's my ping at?
[64:43.44]It's lying to me.
[64:53.97]No, no.
[64:54.55]Fucking juggy.
[65:03.73]This did used to be a Star of the Valley streamer, right?
[65:08.09]Back to bed.
[65:08.63]Yeah.
[65:11.20]Yeah, but you were just doing it because that was the streamer fad and everyone was cashing in on Star of the Valley.
[65:15.94]Cashing in?
[65:17.50]Yeah.
[65:18.12]Italics told me to play it.
[65:19.22]That's why I played it.
[65:20.60]I want to talk to Italics.
[65:21.58]Where's Italics?
[65:22.62]I don't know.
[65:26.11]I'm so bad at Genji, I can't fucking get anyone.
[65:30.29]What's my accuracy right now?
[65:33.36]Like 15% weapon accuracy.
[65:52.28]I got three people.
[65:53.42]Whatever.
[65:53.76]I did whatever I could.
[65:55.68]That almost got me.
[66:00.71]Don't worry.
[66:07.23]I'm going to go 15% weapon accuracy with these scrubs.
[66:17.53]Why did I just say trapped on my screen?
[66:19.59]R.I.P.
[66:20.07]Doug Mendio.
[66:20.57]I was no such thing.
[66:21.53]I forgot about Doug Mendio.
[66:28.19]You know what?
[66:32.57]I'm sorry.
[66:33.33]Why?
[66:37.72]I just had to use an entire ult to kill you.
[66:39.94]I hope that person's happy about that.
[66:43.02]Because I'm not.
[66:44.32]Not at all.
[66:49.03]Come back with a vengeance.
[66:50.77]I'm gonna slip straight.
[66:51.83]I'm gonna show German.
[66:52.67]Do you know that Genji's?
[66:54.69]I bet you didn't know that What about the Lord?
[66:59.24]We're stuck.
[66:59.92]I don't know.
[67:00.92]I was trapped We got nice work I saw the watch out I
[67:14.61]I almost got her.
[67:16.73]Trying to hit her in the head.
[67:19.55]Good attempt.
[67:20.61]Good attempt.
[67:20.95]Is she still up there?
[67:25.13]I don't think so.
[67:30.37]Just wait until I get my weapon accuracy up and you guys are... Wait.
[67:35.49]What?
[67:38.83]It still says 22%.
[67:39.73]Does it not update?
[67:41.80]I've missed a lot.
[67:48.95]I'm doing drop down I'm doing drop down and I was going to one of my favorite things to do is Roadhog is just leap and grab somebody on the way down
[68:14.93]Makes me feel totally just... Just gets me going, you know what I mean?
[68:18.79]It just really gets me going, too.
[68:20.43]It just riles me the fuck up.
[68:21.88]I just... Jesus.
[68:25.24]I'm sorry.
[68:25.76]Hold on.
[68:29.00]Get the fuck over here.
[68:35.36]I'm getting kills.
[68:39.20]I gotta do it.
[68:39.64]I have to do it.
[68:44.86]I think we all died, no?
[68:46.38]No.
[68:46.84]Nobody died.
[68:47.94]I need this.
[68:49.54]I need this.
[68:52.54]Oh, I need it.
[68:54.72]Oh, I didn't do it.
[68:55.42]I didn't even jump.
[69:02.51]People in the chat are just like, what the fuck?
[69:05.53]What the fuck are you doing?
[69:10.18]All of it is a little spicy.
[69:16.68]I didn't have my hand on the keyboard, sorry guys for a second, it was a little spicy almond.
[69:31.68]That's a good question, what is Italics' social security number?
[69:38.56]IKH1, welcome, thanks for three months, welcome back.
[69:42.20]Much love.
[69:44.28]I think this is actually blocking me.
[69:46.38]I'm safe right here because I'm right behind the cart.
[69:59.33]Embrace.
[70:02.27]Got him.
[70:04.35]Don't worry about it.
[70:04.95]I'm learning.
[70:06.79]Good.
[70:10.23]As long as you're learning.
[70:11.21]I'm definitely learning.
[70:12.49]Learn something new every day, guys.
[70:14.03]That is something I've never done before.
[70:15.88]Learn something every day.
[70:24.70]Anybody else?
[70:25.16]Anybody else?
[70:31.43]Get on it.
[70:34.23]Also, I need to be double jumping like a dumbass more.
[70:36.57]That's what I don't do.
[70:39.39]Because then he wouldn't have been able to hit me because Genji's double jump looks like a circus clown's doing it.
[70:43.80]What do I get?
[70:44.56]I can achieve it?
[70:46.08]Yeah.
[70:46.68]Centuary?
[70:48.16]Send it!
[70:48.88]Centenarary.
[70:50.09]Centurary!
[70:50.97]What the fuck was that word?
[70:52.65]Sedimentary?
[70:55.09]What was that word?
[70:55.79]I don't know.
[70:56.53]I didn't see it.
[70:57.25]What was that word?
[71:00.46]Centenarary.
[71:03.99]What was that word?
[71:09.64]I'm so embarrassed.
[71:11.18]What is that word?
[71:14.90]I don't know.
[71:15.30]I didn't see it.
[71:15.88]I want to know.
[71:24.70]It's a cemetery.
[71:26.07]No, it was centenary.
[71:29.67]Centenary?
[71:32.44]Ben Tennyson.
[71:40.96]You couldn't have just wrote congratulations?
[71:59.32]Dun, da-da-dun, dun-da-dun.

[72:49.30]You are a bamf.
[72:50.30]Badass motherfucker.
[72:51.38]You know what I'm saying?
[72:51.94]Yo.
[72:55.81]I asked you a question.
[72:57.36]How's my swelling going?
[73:00.00]How's the swell, dude?
[73:02.10]It's going great.

[73:36.56]Ditch Jerma.
[73:37.22]Ditch Jerma.
[73:38.62]No.
[73:38.74]I'm the real gaming president.
[73:39.86]Just imagine.
[73:40.72]Imagine what I'm doing right now.
[73:42.11]I'm like smiling and shit.
[73:43.41]Like, yeah, I'm smiling at you.
[73:45.27]Hey, guys, you don't have to imagine over here.
[73:46.83]Look, I'm not smiling.
[73:48.31]I never smile and I'm depressed.
[73:50.13]Serious?
[73:52.72]Somebody just subscribed named Centenary.
[73:58.35]You are dedicated to that joke.
[73:59.75]Well, welcome, centenarary.
[74:03.35]I fucking am saying it wrong.
[74:05.79]I'm looking this up right now.
[74:09.65]Cemetery.
[74:10.87]No, I need to look this up.
[74:11.87]I don't know what this word is.
[74:15.41]Whoever said video games don't teach you anything?
[74:19.47]Centenarary.
[74:22.01]Centenary.
[74:24.87]Centenare.
[74:26.49]Centenary.
[74:28.60]The 100th anniversary of a significant event.
[74:30.92]Does it mean I killed like 100 people as Roadhog?
[74:37.99]I don't know.
[74:38.61]Centenary.
[74:46.33]We got a joke master in the stream.
[74:48.79]Guy's a joke master.
[74:51.56]Looking it up.
[74:56.93]Centenary.
[74:57.77]Win 100 games in quick play or competitive play.
[75:02.23]You really played 100 games since his comeback from Vapor?
[75:04.47]Everyone go right, everyone go right.
[75:06.05]I did that a while ago, so.
[75:07.42]I'll go this way.
[75:07.78]Through this door, through this door.
[75:09.86]Like two days ago?
[75:10.58]Huh.
[75:20.56]Alright, no, not playing this.
[75:26.30]Oh, we need like a Winston.
[75:32.50]Holy shit!
[75:35.58]That one guy, 831, that one guy just resubscribed.
[75:39.20]I'll come back to you.
[75:41.60]Thank you.
[75:42.98]Also, seriously, how did she kill me?
[75:44.89]Is there a mine there?
[75:46.37]We're not doing so hot, are we?
[75:52.45]Kinda can't even get out here.
[75:56.20]No.
[75:57.78]Shoot.
[75:59.62]Oh, shoot.
[76:00.24]Oh, shoot.
[76:03.78]How would I know?
[76:04.24]She fucking whispered it.
[76:09.31]Clayfem.
[76:10.73]Clayfem TS.
[76:14.23]Welcome back.
[76:14.63]Thank you.
[76:16.77]Three.
[76:17.37]Another three.
[76:19.79]I've seen a lot of threes and a lot of twos.
[76:21.93]Welcome back, guys.
[76:22.43]Thanks.
[76:24.05]You want a dog, Cam?
[76:31.30]My dog's actually not here right now.
[76:34.52]He went to visit my mother.
[76:35.60]He's spending a couple days with my mom.
[76:40.82]We got him.
[76:43.30]Really?
[76:43.66]Right when I... Goddamn.
[76:50.25]I feel like I'm Genji-ing a little bit.
[76:52.65]Like I'm having bursts of Genji.
[76:56.05]It's not quite all there yet.
[76:58.39]30% weapon accuracy.
[76:59.09]We've seen an upgrade of 5%.
[77:02.10]My power cores are stabilizing.
[77:03.54]Can I stay alive for more than 8 seconds?
[77:10.72]That would be great.
[77:18.01]Human devolution!
[77:19.70]Human de-evolution.
[77:22.17]Welcome.
[77:22.51]Thank you.
[77:22.83]He's gonna... I didn't want to potentially... We're pushed up, like, so far.
[77:31.53]We should just stay on the point, shouldn't we?
[77:35.02]Nah.
[77:36.18]That choke point's so brutal.
[77:37.82]That's fine.
[77:44.25]Winston is so weak.
[77:45.33]Winston is not so weak.
[77:49.21]Winston is a good pick in a lot of situations.
[77:52.45]Yeah, Winston is.
[77:54.15]He's kind of weak, but he did get nerfed a lot, but he's still really good.
[77:57.34]Certainly helps against Sniper Lady.
[78:01.32]Whoa!
[78:21.65]Wow.
[78:24.39]It is the death from Twilight Summoner, that's correct.
[78:35.03]Time is running out, Winston.
[78:41.15]Imagination is the next part of discovery.
[78:44.53]Get on the point, fuckfaces.
[78:49.15]Imagination is the essence of get on the point.
[78:54.67]Oh, so help me God!
[78:55.77]Yeah, I don't know.
[79:13.70]I think my burst of genius...
[79:15.52]What?!
[79:17.59]What?!
[79:19.71]I thought I had plenty of time!
[79:29.73]If that was like a five minute round, I had like, I'd say 45 seconds of I looked good on gimme.
[79:35.75]Which was a massive step up.
[79:37.41]Thank you, the main man, Dan.
[79:39.11]That's very touching.
[79:42.20]Much appreciated, dude.
[79:43.02]Thank you.
[79:50.68]Should I stay Winston?
[79:51.54]No, no.
[79:52.72]We're doing the thing I should have done.
[79:55.85]Let's only play this character.
[79:57.59]Why would I play anything else?
[79:58.85]I don't know.
[79:59.21]Why would you play anything else?
[80:00.11]I don't know.
[80:00.53]Not worth it.
[80:10.31]He's just gonna heal.
[80:15.23]Mmm.
[80:15.83]It tastes so good.
[80:22.93]Oh.
[80:24.51]Feels so good, too.
[80:34.87]I'm so disorientated after a dash.
[80:39.67]Me too, I'm so deeced I don't know on the rocks after a long day of work.
[80:44.12]A long day of dashing.
[80:45.56]Yeah.
[80:45.74]I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[80:56.94]I just wanted to cause problems, that's really all I wanted to do.
[81:00.75]It's gonna cause me the problem, actually.
[81:03.57]Yeah, I think we all just lost.
[81:04.93]Because we had a couple problem children.
[81:10.62]I was one of the problem children.
[81:16.48]You guys talking about fish again?
[81:18.60]I love talking about fish again.
[81:20.64]What are these people talking about?
[81:21.76]Oh, fish.
[81:26.72]Oh, they dropped the fucking beat.
[81:28.56]I didn't even mean to press that button and my 100% is ruined.
[81:30.60]She died.
[81:37.77]I would have grabbed her.
[81:38.37]Died.
[81:38.67]Tell me it's... You just can't aim the sword.
[81:43.50]I just fucking swung three times and I didn't hit no fucking... Fuck Genji.
[81:51.32]Fuck Genji.
[81:51.90]Why am I playing Genji?
[81:53.58]Fucking Genji.
[81:59.22]Where are you going?
[82:07.07]Bro, that killed her.
[82:08.37]It must have all gone into her head, which wasn't even on my screen.
[82:11.13]That was a long... That was the final pixel for me to be able to grab her.
[82:22.92]The final of all the pixels.
[82:26.66]Oh no!
[82:28.06]Oh no!
[82:30.76]Oh no.
[82:32.58]Back out, back out.
[82:33.20]There's snipers.
[82:34.18]I didn't mean to do that.
[82:35.60]Fat fingered.
[82:36.28]I fat fingered the Q. Fat fingered the Q. Yep.
[82:41.16]Go ahead.
[82:41.44]Let me see the fail fishes.
[82:42.75]Let me see them.
[82:49.23]Wow, that was beautiful.
[82:49.95]I just saw that.
[82:51.11]Thank you.
[82:51.65]I'm beautiful.
[83:02.36]I'm telling you, I have these moments of Genji where it's just like... It feels like... Like I've got it.
[83:11.25]But for the next like eight minutes, I'm not gonna have it.
[83:16.87]Did we win?
[83:26.96]I was doing okay.
[83:31.92]Didn't even need it though.
[83:39.57]I don't even feel ze code.
[83:45.31]I'm frozen.
[83:49.27]Are you frozen?
[83:51.01]Update your drivers.
[83:52.97]No, did you say the cold never bothered me anyway?
[83:55.01]Is that what you said?
[83:56.35]No, it was Widowmaker's line.
[83:57.65]She was saying that she can't feel the cold.
[84:00.13]Never bothered her.
[84:02.72]Maybe it's a Frozen reference.
[84:04.06]I don't know.
[84:07.66]Huh.
[84:09.26]Cool.
[84:13.74]You know what I mean?
[84:14.60]Just hanging around.
[84:20.32]I could have gone for the short thing and I didn't.
[84:27.12]What's the short thing?
[84:28.46]The short thing was not to try to pull him.
[84:40.94]You know who that go-behind-you shit happens with every time almost?
[84:44.56]What?
[84:44.94]What go-behind?
[84:45.70]Oh.
[84:47.10]I feel like half the time.
[84:50.61]Definitely a Lucio thing.
[84:52.11]And a Tracer thing.
[84:52.81]I don't think so.
[84:54.58]Run.
[84:56.76]Nice.
[85:17.20]Ooh, nice job.
[85:19.04]I'm falling back.
[85:19.62]I don't want to lose this for no reason.
[85:22.42]Never mind.
[85:23.42]Look around.
[85:28.54]See?
[85:28.94]Tracer and Lucio every fucking time.
[85:31.16]That's a dead Tracer.
[85:34.34]That's a dead Tracer every time.
[85:37.60]That was such a waste.
[85:39.95]Well, they change to lightweight characters to get pulled closer to you, and I think in some instances maybe that means they just get pulled around you.
[85:48.22]But I think even before that change, it happened every once in a while.
[85:51.76]I'm telling you, it's a Tracer and a Lucio problem.
[85:55.66]Well, when you become the master hog like you want to be, remember that that's the case.
[86:02.21]And when you pull a Lucio and a Tracer, adjust.
[86:06.65]You know what I'm talking about when I say adjust?
[86:11.79]Shut up.
[86:22.65]Is his Arya down?
[86:24.25]Fuck.
[86:37.28]Make Jeremy great again.
[86:41.95]2004 Jeremy, come on.
[86:43.71]We need him back.
[86:45.81]No, it was 2012.
[86:48.59]2004.
[86:48.67]Oh, come on.
[86:55.78]Trying just to cause damage.
[86:57.26]Couldn't do anything.
[86:59.56]That fucking sucked.
[87:02.24]Nazaria had her shield still.
[87:04.46]Must have just gotten it.
[87:06.60]And Roadhog ulted to kill one person.
[87:13.70]Do you think if I really pushed for it, really pushed for it, I could get more than a thousand votes present this year?
[87:20.70]If I ran as a third party?
[87:22.47]I think you could.
[87:24.85]Actually, I don't know.
[87:25.97]People would have to leave their house, and I don't think people would do that for you.
[87:28.59]Alright, let's go, let's go.
[87:32.13]They have two down.
[87:40.57]Let's go guys, together.
[87:42.39]Why won't you climb it, Genji?
[87:43.77]Did you say climb it?
[87:47.71]Yes, I said the climate change is part of my presidential candidacy.
[87:52.66]My climate change is running for president.
[87:54.68]Fucking dumb bubble.
[87:56.64]Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.
[87:58.84]I know.
[87:59.22]Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt.
[88:14.26]Oh, you suck, guys.
[88:15.54]I had gold everything on Genji.
[88:17.68]On Genji.
[88:18.38]I couldn't fucking do anything.
[88:19.78]I was just... I mean, I was doing alright.
[88:25.44]I'm happy.
[88:25.86]It's a learning experience.
[88:27.52]I'm just gonna move on with my life.
[88:35.75]Oh, let's break it!
[88:36.69]Yeah!
[88:44.25]That was a sick play of the game.
[89:02.47]Gold healing done.
[89:06.93]Good for you.
[89:13.66]Waiting for you.
[89:15.38]Waiting for me?
[89:16.86]Box, box, open up the box.
[89:19.06]I'm telling you right now, the Dunkin' Donuts I got this from.
[89:23.05]God damn it, again?
[89:24.93]What?
[89:25.91]I got the Peacock Widowmaker.
[89:28.51]Nice.
[89:31.69]Again.
[89:33.33]Good.
[89:33.75]Can I have it?
[89:35.80]Open up a trade.
[89:36.42]Wait, no, I don't want to equip that.
[89:40.04]That's so dumb.
[89:44.64]I don't even, like, I have the Noir Widowmaker.
[89:48.26]That's a bajillion times better.
[89:50.80]A bajillion?
[89:52.26]A bajillion.
[89:54.32]Hmm.
[89:56.28]Right.
[89:56.70]I don't want to be a peacock.
[90:07.97]Right.
[90:19.26]Germany used to play... Germany used to play Lucio.
[90:24.47]No.
[90:25.07]No.
[90:27.05]No.
[90:28.85]No.
[90:29.29]You notice that people from Australia have an R in their no?
[90:36.05]No.
[90:36.55]No.
[90:37.61]No, I've never noticed that.
[90:39.49]All I notice is YouTube.
[90:40.79]No.
[90:42.85]Actually, yeah, now that you mention it.
[90:44.81]Yeah.
[90:44.91]Yeah.
[90:46.20]Yeah.
[90:53.12]Bring back the Undertaker sub sound.
[90:58.81]Uh... Maybe someday.
[91:00.95]Maybe someday if you're a good boy.
[91:03.73]But thank you.
[91:05.03]Thank you for paying $5 to tell me that.
[91:08.55]Much appreciated, dude.
[91:09.25]Thank you.
[91:10.97]No!
[91:11.07]No!
[91:16.43]How come people can't just learn how to talk, like, proper English?
[91:19.47]Like, you know, I'm talking about, like, Jersey, Boston, New York.
[91:22.55]Hey, I'm walking here.
[91:28.47]No.
[91:30.45]No.
[91:31.21]No.
[91:31.74]It's so hard to do.
[91:34.52]It's like, no.
[91:36.20]Like, no.
[91:39.82]Stop it.
[91:40.64]No.
[91:41.16]I don't want to talk to you right now.
[91:43.56]No, like, really stop it.
[91:46.78]Otherwise, I'm going to get the... You're going to spray me with a hose?
[91:51.42]Yeah.
[91:51.90]You're going to put, like, a bottle... You're going to get some vinegar and water in a bottle and spray me in the face with it?
[91:58.32]Get it in my eyes and shit.
[92:00.22]One more Genji, and then I'm going to move on with my life.
[92:02.59]But I'm learning.
[92:05.03]Caught me in a learning moment.
[92:08.23]I'm going to play... We started playing Overwatch, like, good timing, but we just got in a game.
[92:12.17]Ah.
[92:13.60]He heard you saying all the nerds and he just like was cutting himself.
[92:19.08]Jesus.
[92:19.50]Time to embarrass myself.
[92:27.65]Why not?
[92:29.41]No.
[92:42.91]I'm going to make it look like he's shooting the arrow.
[92:45.03]No!
[92:46.13]Look at that.
[92:48.07]See?
[92:49.39]Another one.
[92:52.46]I cover you up, brother.
[92:56.22]You will never amount to anything.
[92:59.30]We shall see, brother.
[93:02.42]He actually just said that.
[93:04.94]I just came over here to start some shit.
[93:09.95]Expect nothing less.
[93:12.26]Quackland!
[93:12.82]Hey!
[93:13.20]Thanks, man!
[93:13.62]Quackland!
[93:15.34]Welcome, thanks for something to do.
[93:21.96]The Quacker.
[93:43.10]Eh, I was gonna get on the point.
[93:44.72]Ooh, I stole that kill from that Roadhog.
[93:51.53]He's probably like, dude, come on, that was mine.
[93:56.51]Holy crap.
[93:58.45]Oh, crap.
[94:01.57]I did it, Ma.
[94:02.33]I thought he was still alive.
[94:11.70]Gotta have confidence.
[94:17.83]Oh my god, you're dead.
[94:18.91]She's not dead?
[94:21.59]Oh, she must have dashed inwards.
[94:22.79]No, Tracer dashed off the edge.
[94:25.03]I knew she didn't have her recall.
[94:28.64]Where did she go?
[94:33.04]No one knows.
[94:42.99]Ow.
[94:45.31]That was 11% weapon accuracy.
[94:48.75]Pretty much throwing arrows into the air and some are hitting people.
[94:55.09]Having 11% accuracy is the same as if I was flying a plane and I dropped a hundred arrows on top of like a battlefield and some of them hit somebody.
[95:04.13]That's what I just did.
[95:08.30]Well, good job.
[95:09.34]Yeah, thanks.
[95:09.74]Good job.
[95:16.76]I'm gonna go use my sword.
[95:19.53]Can you wish me luck?
[95:20.34]Can you say good luck with your sword?
[95:22.78]Good luck with your sword.
[95:24.30]I can ult in right now if you want.
[95:26.96]Should I dragon it up?
[95:29.55]Okay.
[95:31.33]Okay, I'll dragon.
[95:32.01]Okay.
[95:38.02]Us was such a bad idea.
[95:39.10]Sure.
[95:41.26]We like won.
[95:43.44]We kind of just won the game.
[95:45.25]No, I mean, for me it was a bad idea.
[95:47.59]Don't pull your sword out against a tank.
[95:53.41]How many arrows did I shoot?
[95:55.17]Holy shit.
[96:00.33]wow everyone was shooting at me I think lucio won the game if I'm for real have we talked about uh like embarrassing yourself with characters you don't play yeah just do you have my stream open no well if you were to look at it right now you'd probably just be like oh my god wow there's two cards yeah okay we all did terribly so it's not my fault
[96:29.96]That's because their whole team left.
[96:34.34]KJ8011, welcome to the, uh... Welcome to the family.
[96:38.28]Thanks for subscribing.
[96:39.08]Welcome to the trash men.
[96:45.60]Bring it in the PogChamp immediately after subbing.
[96:48.14]That's what I like to fucking see, dude.
[96:49.82]Thank you.
[96:51.62]PogChamp.
[96:54.34]Hey, PogChamp.
[96:55.36]Can you say PogChamp?
[96:57.31]Nope.
[96:59.57]Yeah, let's not do that again.
[97:04.53]I blocked you.
[97:06.53]What do you mean?
[97:08.47]Oh, dude, you already picked it.
[97:09.63]You locked it in.
[97:10.46]Fuck you.
[97:12.56]Blocked.
[97:13.02]Change computers.
[97:15.18]Alright, let me go get a cab.
[97:19.36]I'll be at your place in a little bit.
[97:20.68]Just a little bit.
[97:28.64]Hey, you hear that?
[97:30.87]Yep.
[97:31.65]You got something to say?
[97:37.19]No.
[97:37.33]Oh.
[97:37.47]Got something to say, buddy?
[97:38.45]You know what I'm doing right now?
[97:39.73]I'm hitting my fist into my hand.
[97:41.46]That means getting ready.
[97:43.08]Why are you doing that?
[97:44.82]Do you even have a Roadhog skin?
[97:47.78]No.
[97:48.08]Skins don't matter right now.
[97:49.20]They're getting wiped.
[97:50.76]I know, but like...
[97:52.66]When it's the only character you play.
[97:54.70]Yeah, when it's the only character you play and the only way to get a skin is opening up random boxes.
[97:59.80]Yeah, but don't you get credits?
[98:00.86]How many credits did you have?
[98:02.00]I had like 200.
[98:06.28]I mean, I technically could buy... You're just letting your whole team down when you don't buy your Roadhog skin.
[98:11.91]I could buy one of the random green Roadhogs.
[98:14.09]I don't want that.
[98:27.59]All right.
[98:28.61]Hey, don't be up that far.
[98:29.29]Where is it?
[98:29.57]Where are you?
[98:30.29]You're up there.
[98:30.89]Okay.
[98:32.11]Don't be up that far.
[98:40.55]Whoa.
[98:43.13]I wish those things would shoot laser beams at us or something.
[98:45.69]Oh, man.
[98:45.97]I want to be so stupid right now.
[98:47.97]Wait.
[98:57.02]What?
[98:58.39]Oh, no.
[98:58.73]There's an annoying Genji over here.
[99:00.73]Grenade.
[99:02.45]What do I do?
[99:02.89]It didn't work.
[99:05.85]It's all my fault.
[99:07.03]You can't resist being stupid on Reinhardt.
[99:10.23]No, he's going to eventually get it with perseverance.
[99:15.96]Great.
[99:16.28]He's almost dead, too.
[99:31.29]But thank you, Grenade.
[99:32.21]Welcome back, dude.
[99:33.64]That's a triple month-er.
[99:37.86]So you're up too far, and they just came back, and now they're going to win.
[99:42.84]Okay.
[99:44.26]Do I get to yell at you now?
[99:45.50]Why are you mad about it?
[99:47.36]You yell at me usually.
[99:48.20]Do I get to yell at you?
[99:51.32]This is both Psy Industries, and I just want us to do the last control point for eight minutes.
[99:57.56]Personally.
[99:58.28]Oh, yeah.
[100:05.40]Take that.
[100:08.23]Or you could just stare at me.
[100:23.33]I don't think...
[100:27.78]We're gonna win?
[100:28.80]I don't think there's much that could have been done.
[100:31.62]Is that the second part of that thing you were gonna say?
[100:33.57]Yeah.
[100:34.41]I don't think we're gonna win.
[100:36.05]And I think it's all your fault.
[100:38.27]Really?
[100:38.67]Give me some explanations as to why.
[100:41.01]How much damage did you do?
[100:43.31]I didn't do anything.
[100:45.69]So it's all your fault.
[100:47.19]I was Torbjorn.
[100:48.79]Genji just sat for free and killed my turret because nobody was at the point.
[100:53.27]And then they capped that point.
[100:56.39]Okay, when did you voice communicate and say to come help protect my turret?
[101:00.99]I told you.
[101:01.75]It's your fault.
[101:02.41]You told me, but I'm only one guy.
[101:05.05]Aren't you a Genji?
[101:05.83]You have team chat disabled.
[101:07.51]Aren't you a Genji?
[101:08.27]No.
[101:09.67]Isn't that what Genji's supposed to do?
[101:11.57]I was Reinhardt.
[101:14.04]I thought you said this was your last game as Genji.
[101:18.34]We played that game.
[101:19.66]No, we didn't.
[101:20.50]This is the other side.
[101:22.46]No, that's why you're like, that's not a real game.
[101:27.08]You know when you press tab and it shows you who everyone's playing and we didn't have a Genji on our team?
[101:32.11]That should have been the first clue.
[101:35.87]I trolled you, got you.
[101:39.45]Oh, my God.
[101:40.05]I've never been trolled before.
[101:41.79]Got him.
[101:42.39]Nice.
[101:42.99]I'm so happy you got him there, guys.
[101:48.51]Fine.
[101:48.69]This is my last game as Genji.
[101:50.09]Yep.
[101:51.33]What's going on, fellas?
[102:07.14]Ready to do some communication?
[102:14.09]Talking voice chat, he says.
[102:16.69]Talking, speaking voice chat.
[102:17.83]Why don't you communicate?
[102:20.65]I just did.
[102:21.41]I just threw a fishing hook out.
[102:22.88]Nobody responded.
[102:24.84]So that doesn't mean you stop.
[102:26.00]You know how we're still sending radio waves into space to see if we can find anyone to communicate with?
[102:31.64]We've been doing that for like 30 years at least.
[102:34.68]All right, guys.
[102:35.26]I'm going to toss my orb onto Purple Hats at the beginning.
[102:39.84]We're going to use some communication.
[102:44.45]That's not something you needed to communicate.
[102:46.05]Because when you put your orb on him, he'll know that the orb is on him.
[102:50.16]Make sure to use voice chat.
[102:51.90]Go for it.
[102:57.26]Like anybody fucking listens.
[102:58.14]Also, the orb isn't even on him.
[102:59.80]I'm throwing it around.
[103:00.46]That's what you do.
[103:04.18]Oh.
[103:05.14]Okay.
[103:06.16]If you don't break the one machine that I'm looking at, that I see right now, you lose.
[103:13.59]I don't break it?
[103:14.31]You have to break it.
[103:15.83]This one can't be broken.
[103:16.79]Is that the one I'm looking at?
[103:25.04]You lose.
[103:25.68]Somebody already did it.
[103:26.28]You're looking all over the place.
[103:27.38]Somebody already did it.
[103:27.98]Oh, so I win.
[103:30.34]This one.
[103:31.84]Every time I don't do it, it doubles the amount of money I get.
[103:34.38]Yeah, 10 grand.
[103:35.90]Whatever.
[103:36.54]We're going to follow Medivh in, and Medivh is going to cast a spell.
[103:45.29]Reinhardt's going to walk backwards because he's scared.
[103:49.61]So am I. I'm scared of the... Sniper.
[103:58.53]They don't have a sniper.
[103:59.49]They have a Hanzo.
[104:00.65]There's a Widowmaker.
[104:01.69]Not a Widowmaker.
[104:02.38]Tracer.
[104:02.78]They're all the same.
[104:04.04]I can't think.
[104:05.52]Every name is the same in my brain.
[104:11.48]Medivh, the last Guardian?
[104:12.70]Yeah, that's the one.
[104:14.02]That's the one.
[104:23.68]Um... Remember, I hope you guys are having fun in Team Deathmatch.
[104:32.19]How the fuck did she just glide over there?
[104:34.55]There was no one there.
[104:40.27]Who needs help?
[104:41.71]You do.
[104:45.12]Alright, good communication, guys.
[104:49.84]We're gonna go to the next control point now.
[104:52.68]Somebody revoked your Disney Princess license or something, I guess.
[104:56.30]Me?
[104:57.52]I was never a Disney Princess.
[105:00.10]Alright guys, if me and Star are Disney Princesses, who are we?
[105:04.57]Like, what Disney Princess is Star, what Disney Princess am I?
[105:11.01]Stay on it, stay on it, stay on it.
[105:12.01]No.
[105:12.55]Stay on it, stay on it.
[105:29.10]Yeah!
[105:36.79]I'm seeing so many conflicted, huh?
[105:38.93]We're both the ugly stepsisters!
[105:44.84]I like that.
[105:45.98]We don't get to be the princess.
[105:50.82]Yeah, I saved you guys.
[105:54.42]I think we were just winners.
[105:57.25]There is Moody Elsa.
[105:58.53]I could take that as well.
[106:01.45]Elsa and Anna.
[106:02.49]My favorite movie ever.
[106:03.87]I saw somebody said I was Ariel.
[106:06.64]Shrek.
[106:08.88]That's not a Disney princess.
[106:12.74]Hey.
[106:13.98]Hey.
[106:15.12]What Disney princess am I?
[106:17.66]What Disney princess are you?
[106:20.34]I'm going to say Ariel because I don't know any others.
[106:24.52]That's what somebody else said too.
[106:26.93]That's probably the only one they knew.
[106:28.51]Gawky Hades.
[106:29.43]Gawky Hades.
[106:32.93]All of them?
[106:33.59]Why?
[106:33.93]You have such a wide range of emotions.
[106:37.44]Oh, I'm such a great actor.
[106:39.48]Didn't we come to the conclusion you have five points in everything?
[106:43.50]Yeah.
[106:44.54]I guess that's why I'm sleepy, stinky, poopy, droopy.
[106:49.66]Donald and Dixon.
[106:53.25]Donald and Dixon.
[106:55.61]The reindeers.
[107:01.88]I love this character.
[107:07.24]What character do you love?
[107:08.62]Did you just pick the same character every game, Donya?
[107:11.70]Did you watch the last game?
[107:12.66]I was Zenayatta.
[107:14.86]I'm kidding.
[107:16.45]Stars Richard Nixon.
[107:17.47]Remember the Disney princess, Richard Nixon?
[107:22.51]That would make a good movie.
[107:27.09]He's like singing songs and playing with birds.
[107:30.73]Whirling his hair.
[107:31.47]I can't do a Nixon.
[107:34.73]I was about to attempt to, but I don't think I can do it.
[107:39.48]The way you do Nixon is you kind of just shake your face around and make all kinds of weird noises.
[107:46.84]I did not know anything about Watergate.
[107:48.74]I promise you that.
[107:50.85]That's your day.
[107:51.27]There's your witcher.
[107:52.27]You just have to shake your face.
[107:53.81]There's your witcher.
[107:55.01]There's your witcher, Nixon.
[107:56.27]No, don't get me on this.
[107:57.59]Don't get me on this again.
[108:00.03]I was doing this for like an hour straight one day.
[108:03.26]There's your witcher, Nixon.
[108:05.24]Hey.
[108:06.62]Fuck.
[108:07.62]Fuck.
[108:08.12]He got me on it.
[108:09.22]Sorry, guys.
[108:09.72]Nothing I can do.
[108:12.28]Can't wait to play some Roadhog.
[108:16.14]You gotta be more natural about it.
[108:19.02]What do those Chinese reddits say?
[108:22.95]Chinese wedas.
[108:25.05]Or those Japanese wedas.
[108:28.76]Well, considering we're in Japan, I would bet money that it's Japanese.
[108:36.06]Is this a Japan?
[108:37.90]This is a... You're not saying it's a W. Oh, you can't see.
[108:44.87]There's no R in it.
[108:52.48]Wow.
[108:53.00]That was not fair.
[108:53.58]We stunned each other.
[108:54.24]That was a guaranteed pull if I wasn't ice blocked.
[108:57.76]There's a firefighter, mate.
[109:05.55]Oh no, there's a biolite in there.
[109:08.99]This freezing shit is really starting to damper on my day.
[109:13.91]Really.
[109:14.09]I'm gonna punch that pillow so hard.
[109:25.52]It says, stupid American.
[109:30.04]What are you talking about?
[109:32.84]Stupid American, I don't know what, how am I supposed to tell?
[109:42.25]Why can I not?
[109:43.33]Okay, cool, I hit you one time.
[109:44.79]I'm happy now.
[109:46.78]I don't speak any other languages.
[109:54.86]Now how the fuck am I supposed to know?
[109:56.24]Ow.
[109:58.12]Ow.
[110:01.17]I was communicating.
[110:02.69]I'm like getting bored at this choke point and then I peek out and I'm getting killed by dumb stuff.
[110:09.17]If you kill me I swear to god I'm gonna fucking put my hand through the screen.
[110:14.54]It's a long walk.
[110:18.22]I need oiling.

[110:20.34]Someone oil up this body.

[111:08.36]What the?
[111:10.20]This is like the worst game I've played in a year of Overwatch.
[111:13.60]In the full year that Overwatch has not been available, this is the game.
[111:19.37]I gotta help him make it up to everyone.
[111:29.72]We're kind of winning.
[111:31.88]But not really.
[111:34.88]We went from losing really badly to winning.
[111:36.94]Sort of-ly.
[111:43.88]Break out of your shell there.
[111:54.19]D.Va!
[111:55.39]D.Va!

[113:36.19]Oh yeah.
[113:36.47]Alright, you got nothing.
[113:37.79]Yeah, I got nothing.
[113:39.33]If you streamed the court session, I think you'd be successful.
[113:44.57]That's not gonna hit me, is it?
[113:46.95]Man, copyright ruins so many ideas.
[113:55.11]God damn it.
[113:56.69]I'm the worst.
[114:11.93]Loving that Winston.
[114:14.15]Just want to point that out.

[114:19.91]What do we need?
[114:21.19]A shitty Junkrat?
[114:22.81]Yeah.
[114:23.47]We need a Reaper.
[114:29.87]Or a Sniper that can hit their Sniper.
[114:32.17]I think ours gave up.
[114:34.39]Are you... Are you J.K.
[114:36.77]Rowling-ing me?
[114:38.52]In the Chamber of Secrets?
[114:41.33]Harry Potter World's actually pretty cool, man.
[114:42.79]I went there.
[114:44.57]I rode the rides.
[114:45.69]I experienced the experience.
[114:49.65]I'm so far behind right now.
[114:51.74]Like, what am I doing?
[114:54.20]I'm just coming back.
[114:54.86]I just want to kill the Widowmaker.
[114:55.92]I want to surprise the absolute shit out of this part.
[115:04.01]I didn't even know he was there.
[115:04.89]I just didn't even know he was there.
[115:06.45]Did you get surprised?
[115:07.57]Yes, I did.
[115:09.75]I feel like I just looked that way, and he was not there.
[115:20.39]Oh, Mercy killed her.
[115:21.19]I just want to stream cartoons.
[115:24.69]What's your favorite cartoon you'd stream first?
[115:26.50]SpongeBob SquarePants.
[115:28.34]Easy.
[115:28.90]Really?
[115:29.38]Easiest question I've had to answer all week.
[115:31.44]Really?
[115:31.90]Right in Snippy.
[115:33.02]Easy.
[115:35.22]That would be fun.
[115:36.18]I, like, don't remember any Nerding Stimpy because I was too young and shouldn't have been watching them.
[115:53.59]I'm trying to, like, be inside of them.
[115:55.48]Can I pick up his hammer?
[115:58.56]Get melee on him.
[116:00.12]Going like a melee spree.
[116:04.20]Shit Does anybody else think you should be able to still Paul again G he's doing his IE No, I do.
[116:15.43]What if it deflects back into you and he somehow hooks him?
[116:18.55]Yeah, that would at least be funny But as of right now, it just bounces off like it's a shield Yeah
[116:30.76]I would get a chuckle out of that if it happened.
[116:33.16]Can't even laugh at it.
[116:33.88]That seriously did not hit him?
[116:36.02]I would love to read the paper the next day and find out why that was.
[116:59.70]Just barely didn't go for him.
[117:00.93]Went through him.
[117:22.04]Ooh.
[117:22.42]Ooh.
[117:23.04]Ooh.
[117:23.52]Gravy.
[117:28.23]Somebody just told me I had a quadruple.
[117:31.87]Come to the right.
[117:35.41]Genji?
[117:35.59]I don't know.
[117:37.53]No, it's not Genji.
[117:40.46]Who is it?
[117:44.02]It's a ghost.
[117:52.61]I'm in the danger zone for sure.
[117:57.67]Danger.
[117:59.53]Danger.
[117:59.79]Find your mercy.
[118:03.25]Where was that mercy?
[118:06.17]What?
[118:08.60]What?
[118:11.76]How did he kill you?
[118:15.64]The battle continues.
[118:18.86]He blocked it again.
[118:19.44]How did I kill anyone?
[118:21.48]I fucking hate this.
[118:22.90]He blocked it again.
[118:26.68]God damn it.
[118:35.59]I'm fucking mad.
[118:37.49]A rubber psycho wants me to buy you a beer.
[118:41.49]He gave me $50.
[118:42.51]What's a $50 beer, Jerma?
[118:45.38]It would be like a whiskey.
[118:48.62]He said beer specifically.
[118:50.44]I don't think there is a $50 beer.
[118:51.56]Well, we're going to have to find one.
[118:56.14]Fucking four-person Mercy resurrected, bouncing my shit off.
[119:07.29]Jermo is always the one who goes up to the bar anyway, so he'd be buying it.
[119:10.75]It's a rule.
[119:11.29]If I go up and order a drink, then I'm no better than... Prohibition.
[119:24.67]You've got tomorrow's paper right here.
[119:26.41]Breaking news.
[119:27.29]Jerma dies due to his own incompetence.
[119:30.86]Rip it up.
[119:31.72]That would be a pretty funny headline, actually.
[119:34.30]Hey, stop the presses.
[119:35.24]Guy dies to his own incompetence.
[119:36.94]Stop the presses.
[119:37.72]Pull that.
[119:50.92]I'm gonna lay on the pain.
[119:54.45]I'm gonna... Which means I'm not going to get sniped all game, so I'm going to snipe the snipes.
[120:05.16]It's one or the other.
[120:07.46]I'm gonna play Red Heart.
[120:10.18]That's not Roadhog.
[120:11.08]What are you doing?
[120:11.70]I really took the wind out of my sails with that last loss.
[120:29.89]this shit.
[120:33.65]Can I get rid of this pot?
[120:43.12]Trying to play Hot Cross Bun.
[120:45.76]Hey, do you guys think we should have a Mercy?
[120:48.10]What do you think?
[120:54.45]Hey, the guy that's playing Widow, can you change to Mercy?
[121:03.21]Okay.
[121:04.61]Nevermind.
[121:09.00]I'm gonna do some head shots and some back shots and some trick shots.
[121:14.42]Stay behind my shield, guys.
[121:17.74]I'm so powerful.
[121:20.68]Ah!
[121:21.60]That was a really good shot.
[121:22.70]Take the shield away from me.
[121:25.64]Watch out for him!
[121:26.38]I'm A!
[121:26.56]I'm A!
[121:32.25]That was so far.
[121:32.99]Watch out for the laser beams.
[121:36.47]Please.
[121:41.49]Tutankhamun ale is $52 per bottle.
[121:46.38]Got you.
[121:46.72]See, I fooled you.
[121:47.44]I'll find one of those.
[121:52.62]I thought I was for real.
[121:53.38]I was just kidding.
[122:00.09]Hello, hello.
[122:02.80]Why didn't I hear that teleporter?
[122:03.82]It was like back here.
[122:08.64]Hey, Boo.
[122:09.24]How's it going, Boo?
[122:10.32]Hey, baby.
[122:13.16]Take me with you.
[122:15.76]Take me boating.
[122:16.40]I hear her walking back there.
[122:24.46]Whoa!
[122:25.50]Pranked ya.
[122:26.02]Got ya.
[122:31.83]Ah, shit.
[122:32.93]That was a very unintentional flick.
[122:36.71]Dude, this is going so bad.
[122:38.67]Leave me alone.
[122:39.37]She's one-shot.
[122:43.51]She has no reload.
[122:46.58]All right, all right.
[122:47.20]Okay, we're just gonna mess around, pull our sleeves up, and fucking get to work.
[122:51.04]Get this Roadhog behind my shell.
[122:55.16]Get behind me.
[122:56.97]Oh my god, this healer is so good.
[123:01.44]Where is it?
[123:11.30]Where is it?
[123:12.28]Where is it?
[123:13.42]Look out for the bay!
[123:16.30]Look out for the bay!
[123:19.07]Oh god.
[123:20.97]I didn't have my hook, but I did.
[123:24.01]Hey, good job guys, we got the first point.
[123:26.91]How fucking annoying is that?
[123:31.33]That's probably real fucking annoying.
[123:38.75]Come on.
[123:39.31]I just want to see you fucking play the game.
[123:45.58]I'll show it to you.
[124:00.48]No more jokes.
[124:01.28]No more jokes.
[124:04.14]Oh, they don't have Widow anymore.
[124:09.76]Listen to me, son.
[124:10.96]I'm your dad.
[124:12.92]Destroy!
[124:15.85]The cart is acting very strangely right now.
[124:34.49]We are free to do what we want.
[124:36.89]Sorry, I can't talk in no more jokes mode.
[124:39.17]I didn't do any jokes.
[124:41.01]No, me.
[124:42.43]I was assuming that meant for everybody.
[124:45.60]But that was the thing for everybody to start doing, right?
[124:48.58]Oh, they're teleporters in the stairs.
[124:49.96]They all showed up right as I jumped up there.
[124:55.58]Oh, Bastion.
[124:58.34]With a mercy.
[124:59.48]Thought I got him.
[125:02.87]That's new.
[125:09.89]What?
[125:10.83]Listen to me, son.
[125:14.71]Whoa.
[125:19.92]Whoa.
[125:21.48]Get that cart moved up, boo.
[125:23.60]I have an earth shaker.
[125:27.62]I can shake the earth whenever you need it.
[125:31.02]Hey, you just tell me when.
[125:33.62]I'll shake the earth for you, baby.
[125:37.49]Shake it!
[125:37.93]Shake it!
[125:38.33]Shake it for me!
[125:39.35]What?
[125:40.81]I was about to do it.
[125:41.71]I was about to do it for fun.
[125:43.79]That would have been a very bad joke.
[125:45.65]Don't enable me.
[125:46.47]You're not going to take me seriously in my time.
[125:50.52]I'm going to do it around this corner.
[125:51.52]I'm going to do it.
[125:52.68]I'm going for it.
[125:55.70]I really needed some monkeys.
[125:58.22]He really wanted to monkey me.
[126:01.12]Thank you, Mercy.
[126:02.94]Never mind.
[126:04.52]I didn't hit the Bastion.
[126:06.03]It's kind of odd.
[126:11.03]Was he just out of the cone?
[126:23.10]What the?
[126:23.98]This Tracer is just stuck over here.
[126:35.70]Me, to the right.
[126:36.62]Oh, jeez.
[126:38.40]Where the hell did she put that?
[126:39.78]She put that in such a weird spot that I... Wow.
[126:45.63]Stop being cute and just go for the play.
[126:48.39]I was trying to be cute there.
[126:49.75]I thought it would be... Being fucking cute.
[126:53.35]Stop being fucking... Stop doing the cute play.
[127:00.35]Oh, mercy.
[127:05.21]No, don't freeze me lady.
[127:18.20]Salt.
[127:19.68]A little bit.
[127:32.25]Oh mate, not again.
[127:33.27]Jesus.
[127:37.01]Kind of all.
[127:37.47]Right here.
[127:45.68]Shit in my pants.
[127:50.10]Thank god I got a healer.
[127:51.98]I will heal.
[127:57.05]Here comes the cavalry.
[127:59.63]Or not.
[128:01.27]Or not.
[128:02.17]Bastion's set up right here.
[128:05.11]It was.
[128:11.55]Two down.
[128:13.87]Three down.
[128:20.75]What?
[128:21.81]What?
[128:22.89]Oh, no.
[128:23.75]What?
[128:27.07]Didn't I just kill him?
[128:28.47]Like, fucking five seconds ago?
[128:33.39]Didn't he die less than five seconds before that?
[128:38.11]Mercy res.
[128:39.15]What the fuck?
[128:40.35]Is that what it was?
[128:40.93]I've been muted.
[128:43.41]I keep doing that.
[128:47.67]I got you.
[128:48.41]Thank God.
[128:55.72]Sneed wouldn't have wanted to kill the Mercy.
[129:03.10]That's all I cared about.
[129:03.88]That's...
[129:09.70]Do you care about more things than that?
[129:14.97]I don't think so.
[129:22.75]Get the musketeers.
[129:24.50]Aw, what?
[129:25.08]She had like 5% health.
[129:26.58]Trying so hard.
[129:28.12]Bashing behind us.
[129:37.94]Get the Mei.
[129:38.28]Get the Mei.
[129:38.73]Get the Mei.
[129:40.27]Get the Mei.
[129:41.29]Get the Mei.
[129:43.55]Mei has been got.
[129:45.89]Nice job.
[129:50.04]Nice job.
[129:51.72]Achievement unlocked.
[129:52.24]Centaurian.
[129:54.02]Centaurian Iranian.
[129:55.88]Mesopotamian.
[130:03.31]Oh, cool.
[130:03.97]They changed that.
[130:06.12]Was it the same before?
[130:06.82]I don't think the helms look like that.
[130:09.84]Oh, I was going to say, isn't this where you dive to the Bastion?
[130:14.38]Yeah.
[130:14.60]When you charge in?
[130:17.24]Yeah, you can just hear Mercy right then.
[130:18.44]I died right here.
[130:19.44]Yeah, Mercy right there said she was reviving everybody.
[130:21.68]You weren't listening.
[130:22.44]Because you were probably saying someone's name.
[130:28.19]Oh, shit.
[130:28.49]We are back like one minute.
[130:29.69]I vote for Berserker.
[130:30.23]Oh, thank you.
[130:30.57]I'm going to vote for the five person.
[130:33.39]Yes, got it.
[130:34.01]Bye.
[130:35.36]Bye.
[130:36.02]I can open up a box, I think.
[130:42.34]Did I get a... No, I didn't get a box.
[130:44.57]I'm boxless.
[130:45.59]Jerma holds shield episode.
[130:46.99]Okay, sleeves come back down.
[130:48.07]We're not in focus mode anymore.
[130:52.98]Just kidding, Jermbo.
[130:54.64]Hey, thanks.
[131:07.33]What do I want to do?
[131:08.41]I don't want to get sniped.
[131:09.41]I know that.
[131:11.80]Come on, let's bring it together.
[131:15.28]Hey, come on, let's bring it together.
[131:18.68]I like that line a lot.
[131:21.14]Come on, man.
[131:22.40]It's something about the way it flows.
[131:24.38]It's a great line.
[131:25.73]Let's bring it together.
[131:27.39]Let's bring it together.
[131:28.39]I hope he says it right now.
[131:30.31]Come on, man.
[131:31.97]Let's bring it together.
[131:33.57]Come on, man.
[131:34.19]Electricity!
[131:39.77]That joke is so old.
[131:43.57]From, like, across the room.
[131:45.23]Yeah.
[131:46.27]It's a good one, though.
[131:48.69]You were the boo.
[131:49.35]That was... You were there for that.
[131:52.09]I'm surprised my mic picked that one.
[131:55.23]That's so old.
[131:55.99]I think this is from videos, like, four years ago.
[132:03.60]Here we go.
[132:04.06]Here we go.
[132:05.90]Oh, shit.
[132:06.48]Someone already picked Junkrat.
[132:12.67]Hmm.
[132:15.16]He said it.
[132:15.72]He kept waiting me to say that line?
[132:28.96]What is this?
[132:29.38]Is this a Viagra ad?
[132:35.44]They do like billboards for Viagra.
[132:37.10]Have you seen them?
[132:39.14]There's always like a lady smiling.
[132:55.22]That's a mom?
[132:59.02]Oh, well, never mind.
[132:59.94]That's not what I meant.
[133:03.94]I just saw, like, the billboard.
[133:05.10]That's all I could see.
[133:06.56]That's a mom?
[133:07.46]What?
[133:08.94]I saw, like, this, like, fucking cigarette billboard, and I thought it was, like, an ad.
[133:12.62]Just saw it in the peripheral.
[133:21.79]I'm gonna die.
[133:30.99]It's birth control.
[133:36.56]Oops.
[133:42.72]Now everyone just kind of got destroyed right there.
[133:46.93]They're a little bit tank heavy.
[133:50.19]With a grand total of two.
[133:51.11]Okay.
[134:03.96]Leave me alone, please.
[134:05.00]Oh, he's big.
[134:16.89]Shit.
[134:23.53]Holy shit.
[134:50.96]Don't get me in your sights.
[134:52.34]He did, and he got me in my sights.
[134:53.92]Dude, we're getting our asses destroyed.
[134:55.74]Yeah.
[135:01.94]Everywhere I go, I feel like it's ass-destroying time.
[135:06.64]Yes.
[135:06.90]Oh no.
[135:07.63]Oh no.
[135:08.73]Oh no!
[135:09.19]I have an ult.
[135:12.57]I have an ultimate ability.
[135:13.59]Everyone stand near me.
[135:14.25]I have an ultimate ability.
[135:16.01]This is... This is bad.
[135:21.70]I've got my Lucio ultimate ability.
[135:26.72]Guys!
[135:33.33]Just start mashing on the keyboard.
[135:47.95]How do we stop this bleeding?
[135:49.63]If we go like this!
[135:50.69]I'm so dead.
[135:56.39]Don't say that!
[135:59.29]Not dead yet.
[136:01.87]I'm dead.
[136:05.79]Just skate around.
[136:09.25]I got two, for what it was worth.
[136:11.83]I got the Mercy, which was worth the most.
[136:16.52]Oh, defend!
[136:20.78]I tried so hard right there.
[136:23.94]It's just me and Batman.
[136:27.38]My whole body is sweating right now from that one play.
[136:30.66]And me running around.
[136:39.33]Hey, we stopped the payload for one second.
[136:41.85]Wow, we did it.
[136:43.45]We stopped it a couple times.
[136:44.89]Because we got two lives for one second.
[136:49.08]We had a times two in the corner.
[136:50.02]Let's take that high ground, man.
[136:55.06]Standing in this very corner is gonna get me murdered.
[136:57.23]I know it.
[137:03.91]Oh my gosh, the whole body came from the top left.
[137:07.19]That didn't stun anybody.
[137:08.80]That did not stun anybody.
[137:10.22]Get out of there.
[137:12.28]Star, get out of there.
[137:12.88]What are they doing?
[137:13.28]They're taking the high ground.
[137:14.60]Run.
[137:15.14]Trying to help you.
[137:22.94]Winston.
[137:25.12]Ball accepted.
[137:30.51]I'm gonna have an ult.
[137:37.99]Come near me, come near me, come near me.
[137:42.21]Just, just come near me.
[137:43.23]Oh my god, I'm playing so bad.
[137:53.90]Ow.
[138:00.12]What?
[138:00.32]How is he not stunned?
[138:01.26]Hey, we can do this for another four and a half minutes, guys.
[138:15.54]We can do this.
[138:21.25]We can do this.
[138:21.81]Holy shit.
[138:22.13]Do we have any tanks?
[138:24.01]Kind of.
[138:27.65]Didn't stun him either.
[138:28.55]Oh.
[138:32.27]Watch out for the revive.
[138:33.73]There's a scary lady.
[138:36.77]You feel that?
[138:44.16]Die!
[138:46.78]Wow.
[138:47.56]I thought you meant it.
[138:49.16]You got two people.
[138:51.88]Not enough.
[138:55.08]Get him!
[138:57.70]Don't let him get away with it.
[139:01.71]I'm trying, man.
[139:04.33]I'm trying my best.
[139:08.69]I'm just trying to roll a blade around.
[139:09.77]That's all I want to do.
[139:11.01]Just roll a blade.
[139:13.79]Oh, she died.
[139:14.55]Die.
[139:15.65]Die.
[139:20.42]Top left, top left.
[139:21.62]They're always going to go top left because we need to have people up there.
[139:24.89]That's how you win this map.
[139:28.31]Scatter.
[139:30.15]Not through Reinhardt's shield.
[139:35.29]So behind it.
[139:37.63]That didn't work.
[139:39.48]No, there's like four in there.
[139:40.94]It's not going to work.
[139:44.22]Shake it off.
[139:44.84]Oh!
[139:47.31]What the fuck?
[139:47.73]Could we legit get a Bastion low and down right hot shield?
[139:50.23]That would actually probably be pretty nice.
[139:52.07]Though Tracer's probably going to kill him every time.
[139:55.71]Yeah... Where did they all go?
[139:57.33]Tell me where they're at.
[140:01.72]Are they up here?
[140:02.42]I think I hear them up here.
[140:03.18]They're not on this very middle pillar, no.
[140:06.30]I'll be into Sneaky McCree.
[140:08.06]They're all left, left, left.
[140:09.34]Bottom left, bottom left, bottom left, bottom left.
[140:10.82]All of them.
[140:13.26]I got Mercy.
[140:19.55]Top left again, Soldier Hanzo.
[140:27.78]Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[140:30.26]Oh, shit.
[140:31.14]Oh, shit.
[140:39.60]Oh, shit.
[140:41.22]Do you feel that?
[140:42.49]Oh, that hook was unfortunate.
[140:52.43]We actually might do this.
[140:53.55]I did not think it was going to be possible.
[140:57.05]They're all coming from the right now.
[141:04.06]Ah, to the left.
[141:07.70]Sights, sights, sights left.
[141:08.84]That's not good.
[141:14.39]Oh, here's...
[141:23.21]Oh, greetings.
[141:24.51]Oh, thank God he died.
[141:25.91]No!
[141:32.46]Where's Mercy?
[141:38.08]Get out there, get out there, get out there, get out there, get out there, get out there.
[141:49.53]Nice.
[141:50.31]Nice.
[141:50.51]I haven't seen Mercy.
[141:51.25]Where is she?
[141:51.63]In?
[141:53.83]I hope.
[141:58.81]Sneak some down the hall.
[141:59.73]I need to build ult.
[142:02.11]I so badly need to build ult.
[142:04.60]We're, like, hitting each other, but who cares?
[142:05.96]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[142:09.62]All right, I have an ult again.
[142:16.07]In, like, three seconds.
[142:18.09]You're all together again.
[142:26.25]I would just get back to the cart.
[142:28.95]I fucked up my teleport.
[142:35.37]Don't let them see you cry, guys.
[142:44.09]We did it.
[142:45.59]Holy shit, mate.
[142:47.43]Nice job.
[142:48.05]I told you we had it.
[142:48.75]You were worried the whole time and I said we had it.
[142:50.87]I was.
[142:58.41]You haven't chewed gum in years?
[142:59.47]That's kind of weird.
[143:01.93]I really haven't either.
[143:02.65]I'm more of a mint guy, not a gum guy.
[143:09.18]What's your favorite kind of banana?
[143:14.42]Do you like the brown ones?
[143:15.62]I like the brown ones.
[143:18.49]The overcooked ones?
[143:20.09]Yeah.
[143:21.03]Yeah.
[143:27.85]Thank you.
[143:28.81]He was 94% of the match on fire.
[143:31.07]I feel like he missed a few votes.
[143:34.13]I think I contributed to that by just walking into his arrows a few times with my face.
[143:40.51]Your mom is Hanzo.
[143:42.87]No arising of demons.
[143:57.30]Got him.
[143:59.83]Give him what he wants.
[144:00.85]Because I always play Hanzo on Ilios anyway.
[144:05.37]So deep down, he's not getting what he wants.
[144:07.53]He's just getting, I like to play Hanzo on this map.
[144:12.55]Yeah.
[144:16.89]Yeah.
[144:17.37]When are they going to add another map that's like... Another map.
[144:29.18]Ilios is too pretty, man.
[144:34.02]What's Mei like on Ilios?
[144:35.94]Not good?
[144:36.60]Okay.
[144:40.20]Let's find out.
[144:41.20]I mean, she's Mei, so she's always good.
[144:43.44]He's Mei.
[144:44.36]She's always good.
[144:45.74]How would I filibuster Congress?
[144:47.96]Just take my shirt off.
[144:50.59]Just walk in there and just take my shirt off.
[144:53.61]That's how you'd filibuster them?
[144:54.85]Yeah, and they'd be like, I said, what is this maniac?
[144:57.85]We need to take a recess.
[145:01.30]Is this pre- or post-gym?
[145:03.90]Ah, this is pre-gym, so we're not talking nice.
[145:06.06]Right.
[145:06.68]Okay.
[145:08.82]Like, we're going... We're going way ugly, then.
[145:11.73]Is that what you're saying?
[145:12.45]Yeah, we're going way ugly.
[145:13.65]We're going like, ew.
[145:15.99]Not my woods.
[145:20.35]Oh, my.
[145:22.87]Oh, what the fuck?
[145:25.38]How does that even bounce to me?
[145:28.89]Oh, Junkrat.
[145:30.05]No, no, no.
[145:30.41]That's too much.
[145:32.27]Hit the roof.
[145:33.39]I have trouble when there are people everywhere.
[145:35.73]Yeah, they kind of have an everywhere thing.
[145:39.81]Oh, no.
[145:40.25]It's... I... I... Yeah, I kind of want to play me.
[145:47.81]She's just gone.
[145:48.87]Oh, wait.
[145:49.27]You're a run-up.
[145:50.11]Damn.
[145:53.95]Shit, I have no idea who to play.
[145:56.99]Just gonna wait for my team, but it seems like they went in alone and died.
[146:01.24]Am I German?
[146:01.92]No.
[146:03.16]How are my scatter arrows this bad?
[146:05.70]Alright, I gotta stop.
[146:06.70]I'm paying attention now.
[146:08.26]No more jokes.
[146:09.00]No more fucking around.
[146:09.68]No more talking about taking my shirt off in Congress.
[146:13.04]I'm playing, and I'm gonna fucking kill.
[146:15.18]I'm gonna fucking kill these guys on this point.
[146:16.99]Watch.
[146:17.19]Watch it.
[146:36.05]Bye.
[146:39.69]Sometimes I just hate this game.
[146:41.77]He has Lucio.
[146:44.14]And he has a Mercy.
[146:45.20]This isn't a fair duel.
[146:47.34]Yikes.
[146:53.72]I came in for the duel and what I got was a guy...
[147:06.45]This tracer is like the perfect annoying tracer.
[147:14.75]Never in the same place for more than a quarter of a second.
[147:16.57]I'm ulting the point.
[147:17.05]Go in.
[147:17.99]Use the flashbang to our advantage.
[147:22.42]Kill the Mercy in the back.
[147:23.40]She's behind the point.
[147:24.64]Nope.
[147:31.36]Didn't.
[147:36.78]That was just a mess.
[147:39.37]Well, I'm gonna switch characters.
[147:45.21]Or am I?
[147:49.05]I'm also going to switch characters.
[148:11.89]Pretty big glove.
[148:13.63]Roadhog has big cleaning janitor gloves on.
[148:16.99]Like big rubber gloves.
[148:17.99]Oh my god.
[148:31.83]Fucking god game sucks.
[148:33.17]I fucking hate myself.
[149:00.53]No way.
[149:05.43]Oh, shit.
[149:12.14]No.
[149:15.38]Just everywhere.
[149:18.32]Too many.
[149:24.98]How do you beat a good tracer?
[149:26.12]What do you do?
[149:26.86]Do you just lose?
[149:29.12]You have to have, like, halfway decent accuracy and just hit them every once in a while.
[149:33.97]Even if they rewind?
[149:34.47]Well, why don't you kill this crazy?
[149:37.19]Yeah, if you hit them, they'll rewind.
[149:41.73]You kill her!
[149:44.16]I haven't seen her in, like, an hour.
[150:06.07]I feel like the opportunity is not going to show itself.
[150:09.63]I feel like I'm going to be shooting at Winston.
[150:26.48]Oh, Jesus.
[150:28.26]Wait, what?
[150:29.76]What?
[150:31.32]Hey, spy soup.
[150:41.14]Thanks for the reception.
[150:53.93]I was looking at the chat.
[150:57.55]I was looking over at the chat to say hi to somebody.
[151:01.13]Oh my gosh, no one's in there.
[151:25.15]I'm so sorry.
[151:28.29]I'm muted right now.
[151:29.27]What did you do?
[151:30.99]You have no idea.
[151:34.70]Somebody resubscribed and I, like, looked over to my other monitor to say, like, oh, hey!
[151:39.72]I used my junk rattle, went up a gate, and I clicked and I just killed myself.
[151:50.22]That's good.
[151:52.30]It was pretty fucking stupid, but... Person that resubscribed, that was for you.
[151:58.13]That was for you.
[152:02.29]Something like that is not humanly possible.
[152:03.85]Well, it is if you're not looking at the screen the game is currently on.
[152:16.26]That was so stupid.
[152:19.50]Ugh.
[152:21.50]Fuck.
[152:23.34]We're alive.
[152:26.10]Look at the clown.
[152:26.78]Laugh at the clown.
[152:33.76]I'm gonna play... I kinda wanna play Reinhardt again.
[152:47.61]It went so well last time.
[152:49.19]It did.
[152:50.90]Did it?
[152:51.58]Yeah, I was playing fine.
[152:54.67]We won, didn't we?
[152:55.67]On Dorado.
[152:56.95]Yeah.
[153:14.50]Reinhardt is a Dark Souls character?
[153:16.76]He's more of a World of Warcraft character in my opinion.
[153:40.39]What's the deal, guys?
[153:41.07]What's going on?
[153:41.53]Everyone's being real quiet right now.
[153:48.15]What?
[153:48.81]I'm meditating ahead of my Roadhog performance.
[153:52.75]Oh, okay.
[153:53.11]I need to be as relaxed and prepared as I can.
[153:56.63]That's a good idea.
[153:59.81]I think we should all decompress for a little bit.
[154:02.88]Actually, obviously not.
[154:04.32]Okay, let's
[154:07.51]Oh, Jesus.
[154:08.11]Okay, we're good.
[154:12.17]Good shielding.
[154:14.85]Tracer is just behind.
[154:16.13]We've got a Xayah Roadhog.
[154:23.75]God, I'm running from a Tracer right now.
[154:32.88]She's still up.
[154:33.36]She's going up to you guys up top.
[154:44.18]Well, I thought I was facing a different direction.
[154:48.18]Damn.
[154:48.72]I thought I was facing forward.
[155:09.39]Hit the bus for good luck.
[155:11.47]Yep.
[155:24.53]Damn it.
[155:25.35]I'm not playing Reinhardt.
[155:29.84]I'm playing Winston.
[155:31.16]I was thinking of Winston, but I feel like it's going to be really hard to cut through Xayah right now.
[155:46.06]Yeah, I just... Reinhardt was not working at all.
[155:53.64]Thought it was going the other way.
[155:58.80]Oh, we have two.
[156:08.71]Is that Boo?
[156:09.23]That is Boo, you're right.
[156:17.48]Who am I stalking?
[156:18.12]I didn't even get a killcam, what did I die to?
[156:25.89]Did you die to yourself?
[156:27.71]No, apparently Tracer killed me but I didn't get a killcam.
[156:30.29]The death looked really weird.
[156:31.17]I just jumped right in the worst possible spot.
[156:52.83]No, she stuck me.
[156:55.99]Tracy really doesn't like me.
[157:01.55]Yeah.
[157:02.33]Actually, she kind of just threw that into the crowd and got somebody.
[157:07.46]Yeah.
[157:11.24]Do I watch The Office?
[157:13.18]I have not heard of it.
[157:15.38]I've seen like three episodes.
[157:17.46]I saw the office.
[157:23.00]I saw like three episodes.
[157:24.80]I saw them all.
[157:26.06]It was okay.
[157:34.48]I love oligarchies.
[157:38.58]Ah, scatter arrows.
[157:39.68]Damage boosted.
[157:43.06]Not fun.
[157:44.48]Not cool.
[157:45.10]Tracer's behind us to the right.
[157:48.75]Did I just jump into the Reinhardt doing that move?
[158:00.98]Oh, jeez.
[158:01.38]What is going on?
[158:10.03]A whole lot of shit was just going on in that room.
[158:11.81]And I was too big to know what was going on.
[158:27.32]German never lucky.
[158:30.10]Man, never lucky.
[158:38.51]Oh, painful.
[158:44.91]To the left.
[158:48.39]Stealthy road hog.
[158:53.67]Greetings.
[158:59.75]It's all the way back here.
[159:02.29]Yeah.
[159:06.48]It shouldn't have been where that was.
[159:08.20]Coming left, probably.
[159:10.40]Oh, no.
[159:10.74]Bridge.
[159:11.80]That's dead.
[159:16.18]How the hell did Honda not die?
[159:25.06]Nobody over there.
[159:32.71]Oh, I missed.
[159:36.30]Can't land them all.
[159:38.50]That's a strategy.
[159:39.08]Tracer's the only one there.
[159:39.90]I shouldn't have ulted.
[159:55.22]Tracer, fuck off.
[160:03.66]They have two Winston's?
[160:10.89]Somebody changed.
[160:12.61]Somebody changed eventually there.
[160:13.97]Yeah, they have two now.
[160:14.77]Where was that res from?
[160:39.68]Oh, Reaper.
[160:40.26]Holy shit.
[160:41.08]Wow.
[160:41.20]Did he die?
[160:49.59]I guess he just died, huh?
[161:01.83]Problems.
[161:04.21]Ugh.
[161:15.68]Problems!
[161:17.18]Oh, that knocked my aim around a lot.
[161:27.02]Ah, I needed two more percent and I could have monkeyed.
[161:42.89]Winston's a scientist, so he's better off.
[161:48.29]The scientific Winston.
[162:07.82]Oh my god, big gorilla boxing fight.
[162:12.75]Boxing match.
[162:18.61]Kill the Junkrat.
[162:20.21]Oh!
[162:24.85]Really?
[162:25.26]This is... How is it... How is... How is there nobody there?
[162:31.19]Black Spruce won.
[162:33.67]Coming back with the three months.
[162:35.19]Thanks a lot, dude.
[162:35.99]I'm waiting for buddies.
[162:37.79]I could use a couple of them.
[162:39.46]There was a buddy that was just over there for about a full 60 seconds.
[162:43.02]Hard to push into this.
[162:58.72]I can clear it with High Noon, but we need a Winston shield in front of it.
[163:01.41]What are you talking about?
[163:07.21]Where?
[163:08.41]On the cart.
[163:08.91]Just throw a Winston shield on the cart.
[163:10.53]It's going on right now.
[163:20.20]I killed four of them.
[163:23.62]Even through that?
[163:25.24]The Junkrat Tire killed three people.
[163:27.02]Yeah, it did.
[163:28.81]Oh, would've made a push, right?
[163:30.69]Lately.
[163:31.45]Hopefully.
[163:33.67]Team kill.
[163:34.31]Did we both just get a team kill?
[163:37.42]Eh.
[163:37.80]Two-way team kill.
[163:39.28]Almost.
[163:43.36]Might be able to get Monkey one more time.
[163:50.67]Yikes.
[163:52.39]Yikes-a-run.
[163:54.79]Holy shit.
[163:56.29]Double on the card!
[163:59.98]Oh, my.
[164:00.34]I don't know.
[164:05.00]Might be a little too far.
[164:07.96]Oh, maybe.
[164:12.10]Anybody can touch it?
[164:12.83]Somebody touch it!
[164:13.27]Somebody touch it!
[164:14.55]Oh, shit.
[164:14.95]Let me get forward.
[164:15.69]I tried.
[164:20.11]I wonder whose perspective the play of the game is from.
[164:23.55]The, like, full team wipe it through.
[164:25.33]I know.
[164:27.80]This guy.
[164:28.40]Damn.
[164:38.17]It's like we had four people there that could have shot it.
[164:42.76]This is like fell over at the end.
[164:48.10]500 rockets fired?
[164:48.90]Nice, man.
[164:50.00]Nice, dude.
[164:52.68]Wouldn't that just be like 100?
[164:54.76]Yeah.
[164:54.92]I'll do one more.
[165:01.70]Okay.
[165:02.76]One more then I can be done with you.
[165:05.86]In a sense, yeah.
[165:11.51]Alright guys, I'm hitting my belly right now.
[165:16.25]Why?
[165:16.53]I'm roleplaying, because I'm playing Roadhog for the last goddamn game.
[165:28.78]Oh, that's what Roadhog does?
[165:30.60]He grabs the stomach and he goes like, shakes it.
[165:32.72]Alright.
[165:55.69]Fire in the hole.
[165:59.09]Phew.
[166:18.00]Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.
[166:23.00]Boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop.
[166:28.00]That was beautiful, thank you.
[166:39.00]Roadhog's face. Not that we see his face, but Roadhog's mask.
[166:53.37]Let's do it.
[166:56.55]Let's go for it.
[166:58.55]What do you say?
[167:04.25]I am ready.
[167:07.58]Ah, that is... Um... Fuck, uh... Gnome.
[167:10.96]Gnome card.
[167:28.42]Oh, what?
[167:32.08]Where's Snipe?
[167:32.60]Very, very surprised I didn't hit him.
[167:36.79]Thank you.
[167:39.27]Snipe's dead.
[167:41.07]No Snipes.
[167:43.17]Man, it's not... I gotta get on the ball here.
[167:47.11]I really fell off these last few games for some dumb reason.
[167:55.89]I'm suffering from gamer exhaustion.
[167:59.19]Behind us is a... There's two instants again.
[168:03.89]Oh, what?
[168:04.21]I headshot her.
[168:09.21]There's red bubbles everywhere.
[168:10.47]I'm so scared back here.
[168:24.55]Winston Tracer on the point.
[168:25.67]Where do I go?
[168:26.65]Nice.
[168:42.48]They have... Oh, now it's only one Winston.
[168:46.78]But they have Roadhog too.
[168:48.12]Cool, cool.
[168:50.48]Nice.
[168:51.94]Nice.
[168:54.87]Thank you for the heals Damn it Goddamn gamer exhaustion.
[169:14.97]I don't like how this looks
[169:51.17]Someone's one shot.
[169:52.15]I'm gonna go something Like yeah, I can't play video games right now.
[169:57.12]I'm gonna do something else.
[169:57.82]I'm gonna play Lucio.
[169:58.94]Oh
[170:37.60]Run!
[170:51.56]Who's the best support?
[170:52.30]That's very subjective.
[171:04.28]I think Lucio is the best support.
[171:06.80]Widowmaker above middle.
[171:13.08]That's just me.
[171:13.73]I think he does a lot.
[171:17.11]He does a million different things.
[171:18.29]Widowmaker is still up top right.
[171:30.47]Zenyatta is trash?
[171:32.17]I don't think so
[171:57.49]I think he's very easily killed, but Orbit Discord is probably the best move in the whole game.
[172:07.19]So you give and you take.
[172:08.15]I have an ult.
[172:14.34]Kind of want to do it.
[172:33.14]Ugh.
[172:34.00]Jesus.
[172:34.70]My god.
[172:38.50]We had a Symmetra, and I was enjoying not getting one-shot by Widow.
[172:42.02]Not anymore.
[172:43.12]Oh.
[172:44.25]God.
[172:45.37]Fuck.
[172:46.73]Ah, that's so infuriating.
[172:48.71]That is just so aggravating.
[173:11.11]That's a damage boost too.
[173:12.25]Thank you.
[173:19.26]I tried to help.
[173:21.08]You did?
[173:21.52]Uh, did Winston get res?
[173:41.18]They have a Reaper now?
[173:42.84]Yes.
[173:43.78]I haven't seen him the whole time.
[173:46.16]Did he just change?
[173:48.60]I think he's fresh, yeah.
[173:50.54]Oh, he's fresh.
[173:53.89]Winston's behind us all the time.
[173:57.89]He should unmute and tell us.
[174:09.79]I... I just kind of accepted that I was gonna die.
[174:13.61]Well... Apparently I didn't shoot at McCree.
[174:18.42]I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I did!
[174:37.87]Yes.
[174:40.32]Get Reapered.
[174:41.46]Oh, Jesus Christ, they're all just... ...dairy enemies.
[174:45.43]No, no, no, don't let her do it!
[174:47.21]Get her out of here!
[174:47.75]Whatever accuracy I had... ...moments ago is fucking gone.
[174:57.89]I can't hit anything right now.
[175:03.02]Wall hacks.
[175:04.50]I didn't realize how the potential undertones of that.
[175:08.72]I said wall hacks.
[175:31.48]Genji on top.
[175:32.88]Oh, bleep it.
[175:37.91]Everyone needs to stay alive.
[176:03.18]Reaper's teleporting.
[176:04.18]Fine.
[176:04.44]I have another ult.
[176:09.67]If they come pouring in, I'm gonna use it.
[176:27.91]Headshot right there.
[176:28.73]That'd be so bad.
[176:29.54]Oh Don't don't do that Jerry don't do that and you do not do that All that I will die but not that old German Mercy
[176:58.32]High noon!
[177:00.38]Oh, boy.
[177:01.05]Okay.
[177:04.31]Okay.
[177:06.75]That one hurt.
[177:07.29]That one hurt.
[177:08.95]Well, good game.
[177:11.99]I hear that's Jerma's last game.
[177:13.47]That's my final game.
[177:14.15]I hear he's done playing.
[177:16.08]Did you see how she looked at you like, I got you guys.
[177:18.30]Yeah.
[177:19.17]No, she looked at me like you're the only one for me.
[177:21.97]Boy, she got you.
[177:22.89]She gets like every single person here.
[177:26.71]With one or two shots.
[177:27.97]Why are you all coming around the corner?
[177:31.15]You can't walk around a corner in this game?
[177:34.16]That corner?
[177:34.72]There's no... Why?
[177:37.58]Why?
[177:37.94]What, you're not allowed to walk around a corner?
[177:39.40]No, Jeremiah, you're wrong.
[177:45.52]Hey, I got a box.
[177:47.18]I got a box.
[177:47.80]There's nothing in my box.
[177:53.36]Well, I got Zenyatta.
[178:00.06]4D dust.
[178:01.06]Nice.
[178:02.26]Alright, guys.
[178:05.16]Star is still going to stream?
[178:09.34]I'm going to keep going for another couple hours, man.
[178:15.66]Okay.
[178:18.01]Let me open up my box.
[178:22.37]See what's in it.
[178:28.04]Blue Torbjorn.
[178:29.40]Blah.
[178:31.74]No, I don't want to play Pharah.
[178:36.84]It's kind of a cooler version of my steering wheel.
[178:41.52]It's a pulse bomb, though.
[178:44.10]Fuck that.
[178:45.66]I like that one.
[178:46.70]Definitely like this one.
[178:51.29]All right.
[178:52.36]Go watch Star.
[178:53.84]If you're currently watching Star right now, then it's cool.
[178:58.16]Take it easy, guys.
[178:58.62]Thanks for hanging out.
[179:00.74]I will catch you guys later.
[179:02.86]Goodbye.
[179:03.40]Good luck.
[179:05.15]And I'll talk to you soon.
[179:07.11]Good night.
