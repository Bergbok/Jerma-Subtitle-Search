[00:08.81]Alright, Michael, we're here on your special day!
[00:11.71]That's right, it's MY birthday today, not anybody else's!
[00:14.31]It's MY birthday!
[00:15.05]Alright, Michael, calm down!
[00:16.57]Mom, shut up!
[00:18.03]I get all the presents, Kathy doesn't get any, cause she's an idiot!
[00:21.23]Come on, Michael, you ruin your fucking birthday every year for everybody else, we get it!
[00:26.15]I went through so much trouble to get you this RATS mixtape, I know how much you like them, can we just dance together as a family for once?
[00:49.00]This year I got something new and exciting and different for everybody!
[00:52.25]Hey kids, it's me!
[00:54.19]It's a clown!
[00:54.81]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy!
[00:56.25]Get away from me!
[00:57.07]Please!
[00:57.51]What the hell is happening?
[00:58.77]It's a clown!
[00:59.51]This clown's out of control!
[01:01.06]Just chill out, everybody calm down!
[01:03.64]Everybody calm down, I'm just a clown!
[01:07.02]Oh, whoa, man, that clown.
[01:09.42]Why did you invite him?
[01:14.46]We're the rats.
[01:16.67]We play at night.
[01:17.85]We stalk at night.
[01:19.37]We're the rats.
[01:21.81]I'm the giant rat that makes... Hey, wait.
[01:25.15]Hey, wait.
[01:25.93]I'm stuck.
[01:26.87]I'm stuck.
[01:27.33]I knew this was a bad idea.
[01:28.75]I'm stuck.
[01:29.63]How did you... You're making us late to the birthday party.
[01:32.50]I'm the giant rat.
[01:33.20]I make all the rules.
[01:34.02]You need to help me out of here now.
[01:35.48]You know, you say that, but...
[01:45.82]Hey, happy birthday.
[01:47.84]Dad, those are rats.
[01:50.28]Yeah, happy birthday.
[01:51.76]Special box inside a treat for you here.
[01:53.78]Thanks for the guy.
[01:54.56]Thanks for the guy.
[01:56.13]Bye.
[01:57.27]Oh, I remember that box.
[02:00.57]I shit in that one.
[02:01.65]Oh, Dad, it's definitely something really cool, a super cool toy that everyone's going to be jealous of.
[02:07.57]Hey, what's up?
[02:08.31]I'm your new best friend.
[02:09.47]We got a problem.
[02:11.25]The fat guy doesn't fit out of the toilet.
[02:22.82]Alright, honest opinions?
[02:23.91]What did you guys think?
[02:27.36]That wasn't good at all.
[02:29.01]Yeah, why?
[02:29.67]That was bad.
[02:30.61]That was terrible.
[02:31.91]Well, that's the beauty of this whole thing, son.
[02:33.39]None of this even matters at all.
[02:35.65]As a sequel, we're trying to do one very important thing.
[02:38.33]That's sell toys, sell books, and sell audio tapes.
[02:41.57]Now, the movie itself could be about a blue toothbrush.
[02:44.91]And as long as we sell the merchandise and keep the suits happy, who cares about the subject matter?
[02:49.71]But I... What if you don't... What if I don't have a suit?
[02:57.83]Prepare the drop.
[02:59.29]And please, hit the right target this time.
[03:02.56]Yes, Ka-ai-ai.
[03:17.80]You don't need to know what I had for breakfast this morning, alright?
[03:20.02]Just let's talk about the deal!
[03:27.07]Wasn't there a guy that was just right here?
[03:29.07]Huh?
[03:33.87]What's this guy doing here?
[03:35.23]This might be the pizza delivery guy.
[03:36.97]Yeah, I'm gonna go get the car, and I'm gonna pull it around.
[03:40.37]Save me a slice.
[03:41.03]Don't eat the whole thing!
[03:41.93]I don't know.
[03:43.57]It might be a pizza.
[03:44.65]Maybe I press it, I'll get a pizza.
[03:47.22]I'm going home.
[03:50.56]I wanted chicken nuggets.
[03:57.39]Whoa!
[04:00.31]What was that?
[04:02.61]Welcome, Rat King, to the Dog Capital.
[04:06.45]I trust you're alright?
[04:08.14]In that case, walk with me and talk with me.
[04:12.62]I'm going to show you something that I haven't shown anyone in over two thousand years.
[04:17.90]What do you see before you?
[04:19.34]Yeah, a toothbrush.
[04:21.05]It is a toothbrush.
[04:22.59]One of the most important in the entire galaxy.
[04:26.34]Oh, cool.
[04:27.64]This toothbrush holds the DNA of every single animal on Earth.
[04:32.38]It must be protected.
[04:33.68]Oh, yeah, I know.
[04:35.20]If this would have fallen to the wrong hands... The infiltration was a success!
[04:39.13]We've been breached.
[04:40.37]We have been breached.
[04:41.95]Sound the alarms.
[04:42.91]We have been breached.
[04:50.33]What's happening?
[04:51.33]I've been in a nightmare for two weeks straight!
[05:19.54]That's a pretty good toothbrush.
[05:27.66]Now hold on just a second.
[05:28.74]Pause the movie.
[05:29.56]Hit pause.
[05:33.34]Did you hear what they just said?
[05:35.04]That toothbrush has got the DNA of every animal on Earth.
[05:38.76]Well, mate, it's just a movie.
[05:41.28]I don't buy that for a second.
[05:42.72]You're telling me it's just a movie?
[05:44.36]Was Finding Nemo just a movie?
[05:46.50]No, that was a documentary.
[05:47.93]They had cameras down in the ocean.
[05:49.59]I remember seeing them filming it in Philadelphia.
[05:51.21]Wait, hang on a second.
[05:52.15]I'm just going to get up right now because you're fuming me.
[05:55.17]I'm just saying, we rented this film from Blockbuster.
[05:58.35]Oh, yeah, Blockbuster closed.
[05:59.93]Good joke, Jeremiah.
[06:00.89]I'm going to go to the sewer.
[06:01.81]You coming with me?
[06:03.31]I... Well, no, but... See you later.
[06:05.66]I mean, you can't... Bloody hell.
[06:10.28]Nice and easy, you don't want any cops to see us pulling in here.
[06:14.24]Alright.
[06:15.18]We're gonna have to split up for this.
[06:16.68]Lot of junk.
[06:17.74]Yep.
[06:18.54]Tell me if you find anything.
[06:19.92]I thought I'd be doing real jobs.
[06:21.76]Robbing banks, stealing paintings... It's a pretty good fill of content, yeah.
[06:25.06]I'm waiting through shit to find a dirty toothbrush.
[06:27.02]Right, this is just to make sure you understand the story.
[06:29.00]Fucking day off as well.
[06:30.36]Yeah.
[06:31.04]I need to see if it matters.
[06:32.73]Yeah, no, it doesn't.
[06:33.65]Oi, got something for you.
[06:34.84]You found something?
[06:35.72]Yeah, I got something too.
[06:37.90]What do you got?
[06:38.98]Well, it's, uh, it's a blue toothbrush.
[06:40.90]Yeah, uh, they're, uh, they're fucking everywhere, man.
[06:44.32]So, just grab a couple, uh... You know, we could probably sell these.
[06:48.14]Get in the car.
[06:48.72]You know, I got an idea.
[06:49.78]I know exactly who we can sell these to.
[06:52.38]Put your seatbelt on because I'm about to step on the gas.
[06:58.59]I wouldn't go to a doctor, but I'm just scared of what he has to say, you know?
[07:02.32]That's why I asked you about it.
[07:03.40]That is just Grimmsville.
[07:05.06]Quiet down here.
[07:05.60]Let me do the talking.
[07:06.68]You keep your mouth shut.
[07:09.20]How we doing this evening, cat police?
[07:11.51]We don't have time for small talk.
[07:13.47]Did you bring the product or did you not?
[07:15.90]Yeah, did you get my text by any chance?
[07:18.40]I have Verizon, so maybe it didn't go through.
[07:20.48]Enough.
[07:22.42]The least of your concern should be text messages and how we are about to decimate your disgusting planet.
[07:29.12]The $20 is what I was told.
[07:31.26]So you don't get shit unless I see $40.
[07:34.53]Not so fast!
[07:37.30]The rats have told me everything.
[07:39.76]And if you think that I, Garry, guardian of- This ends now, cat police.
[07:46.13]What do you have to say about this one?
[07:47.89]Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?
[07:49.98]And I'll see what happens when you find me.
[07:51.56]And one-on-one, I'll beat you up.
[07:53.94]How did you guys sort this out?
[07:55.36]For centuries, we have tried to find the Noah's Ark toothbrushes.
[08:00.03]And for centuries we have failed.
[08:02.14]But not tonight.
[08:02.98]You intergalactic space beings will never win.
[08:05.96]We will always band together and stop you at any cost.
[08:10.35]Such a pity.
[08:12.03]It's too bad, really.
[08:13.77]Our DNA would have fused together wonderfully.
[08:16.87]Now let us show you our true power.
[08:28.28]And now witness the power of over 2,000 galaxies, combat!
[08:36.05]And yours will be next!
[08:37.95]Evil will never win!
[08:41.61]Quickly, Hero!
[08:42.77]There's not much time!
[08:44.23]Take that toothbrush and cast it into the fires of Maldum!
[08:51.24]I will hold him off as long as I can!
[08:53.02]Take that!
[08:55.48]Maldum.
