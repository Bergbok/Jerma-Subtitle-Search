[04:19.18]I'm dying.
[04:20.38]Kiss me.
[04:20.98]Ah, you're in the way.
[04:34.95]We're running four inches behind this guy.
[04:39.15]This guy's gotta be a fucking idiot if he can't see.
[04:43.10]Oh, I'm showing, I'm showing twine.
[04:45.44]But only that, but it's raining, so, like, our feet are going, like, sloshing around in the rain.
[04:51.06]Wow, dude.
[04:51.76]You cannot be spotted.
[04:53.14]You can't be seen here.
[04:55.38]You're right, the hand-holding is ridiculous.
[04:56.83]You cannot be fucking seen.
[04:58.63]No matter what we do.
[04:59.29]Oh, my word.
[05:04.07]Oh my word.
[05:07.79]Who's coming this way?
[05:09.13]I don't think it even matters.
[05:10.97]Oh no, he's coming this way.
[05:12.18]Yeah, watch what happens.
[05:13.54]Doesn't even matter.
[05:14.78]Oh yeah, it does.
[05:16.28]Yeah, let's see if you can do this without falling four times.
[05:28.93]No, holding the button didn't matter.
[05:30.31]No, it doesn't matter at all.
[05:33.50]Doesn't matter at all.
[05:36.17]It just does not matter.
[05:40.15]Oh yeah, it does.
[05:40.65]Because we're hitting the wrong buttons.
[05:48.00]This is really, uh, this is the tension.
[05:56.06]Your body went limp!
[06:01.07]Do you really have to ask why with this game?
[06:08.89]You see how your body just like... Why would you ever do dead weight off of that?
[06:18.07]Even if you fall, you'd land on your feet and run.
[06:24.17]Watch this guy fall off the roof intentionally.
[06:27.25]Ah, don't, please!
[06:28.07]They all fall off the roof.
[06:30.27]What a bird!
[06:31.59]What a dick!
