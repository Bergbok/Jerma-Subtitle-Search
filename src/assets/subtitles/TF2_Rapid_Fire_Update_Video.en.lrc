[00:05.92]Hey, how you doing everybody?
[00:07.64]Good evening, good morning, good afternoon, good night.
[00:10.24]Hi, I'm Jerma.
[00:11.73]This is a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress 2.
[00:13.57]And we're going to talk about some things today.
[00:15.71]This is demo night with the double donker, Loose Cannon.
[00:19.47]Although I don't really do very many double donks with it.
[00:21.78]I was just kind of messing around, just wanted to get a gameplay real quick.
[00:24.22]So I could talk about some things.
[00:26.30]And we have a lot to talk about.
[00:27.60]There are a lot of things to discuss in this video.
[00:30.57]We're going to go over the first one really specifically, really quickly.
[00:33.87]Tip of the Hats is this coming weekend.
[00:36.22]So today, I believe I'm recording this on Monday.
[00:38.92]So Tip of the Hats starts on the 19th of Saturday.
[00:43.17]It's the yearly charity event that the TF2 community puts together.
[00:46.89]It's a lot of great people involved, and it goes to a great charity, the donations.
[00:50.37]So come hang out.
[00:51.45]I'll be there for a lot of it.
[00:53.65]I don't know what my exact time slots will be when I'm going to be pubbing and playing and just hanging out.
[00:58.92]I'll be there for a lot of it.
[00:59.82]So come.
[01:00.52]The link will be there in the description.
[01:01.90]Come check it out.
[01:02.78]Tipofthehats.org is the website as well.
[01:05.94]I encourage you to check it out.
[01:08.10]So next thing, we're gonna really, really quickly, this is gonna be a real rapid-fire update video.
[01:12.08]A real rapid-fire update video.
[01:14.14]There's an update.
[01:14.60]There's an update right there.
[01:15.88]There's an update over here.
[01:17.12]So I'm fully moved in.
[01:18.95]I am in my new place.
[01:20.73]I'm settled.
[01:21.53]I got all my stuff here.
[01:22.53]Everything is here.
[01:22.95]I don't have to go back and forth anymore.
[01:24.31]That was the big problem with trying to settle in here.
[01:27.41]Every day there was something else.
[01:29.37]For the last, like, month and a half straight, I had, like, no...
[01:33.63]I mean, I had free time, but every ounce of my free time, I'd sit down to play a game, or I'd sit down to do something, and like, there's like somebody at my door, yeah, we're here to fucking tear something down and put something up.
[01:44.22]And I'm like, okay, come on in, gentlemen.
[01:46.76]It's just been kind of a rollercoaster these last couple of months.
[01:49.34]But the good thing is, it's over.
[01:51.26]You know, I'm here.
[01:52.78]I'm living here.
[01:53.76]No constraints.
[01:54.88]I can do what I need.
[01:55.72]I can do what I please.
[01:57.24]I am just so excited.
[01:58.49]We've got another update coming in.
[02:00.29]Keep the updates coming.
[02:02.35]My stream.
[02:03.85]As of this video tonight, I'm going to be streaming at least three or four times a week.
[02:09.97]This is the announcement video, this is the come to my Twitch channel, come and check it out.
[02:14.27]I will be live a lot.
[02:16.34]Now, I don't have exact times, and I probably never will.
[02:20.08]Because me and schedules, we've talked about this a thousand times.
[02:23.56]I don't do well with a schedule.
[02:25.58]Ever.
[02:27.00]I think I've said this in at least like five or six different videos.
[02:31.48]But the point is, I'm gonna turn it on whenever I'm comfortable, sitting here, ready to go, ready to stream.
[02:39.11]Is it two o'clock in the morning?
[02:40.87]I don't know.
[02:41.77]Is it four o'clock in the afternoon?
[02:43.69]Potentially.
[02:44.81]Could it be a morning breakfast show?
[02:47.21]You betcha.
[02:48.35]But I'm not going to pigeonhole myself into a particular time or a particular game for that matter.
[02:54.27]Don't expect to open up this stream and see Diablo 3 for seven straight months.
[02:59.07]It's not going to happen.
[03:00.25]Because streaming for me is...
[03:02.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[03:03.84]This update's not done.
[03:04.74]I'm not done with this update.
[03:05.60]Stop.
[03:06.10]This update isn't done yet.
[03:07.50]In fact, don't fucking do it again.
[03:09.48]Just don't.
[03:10.00]That's so done by this point.
[03:11.56]Just don't do it again.
[03:13.06]Streaming for me is going to be more of a chilled out, relaxed atmosphere.
[03:17.33]I'm not doing it for a bigger paycheck or anything like that.
[03:21.85]It's just I want to be able to chill with you guys, relax in the chat.
[03:24.87]Everybody has fun and we play whatever.
[03:27.94]Also, we can talk about YouTube streaming a little bit here, too.
[03:31.58]It just came into beta, it's out, I can stream on it, I can use YouTube Gaming, the live platform, right now if I wanted to.
[03:38.27]But I don't think I'm- initially, I don't think I'm going to, because the chat's just really not that great, it's in its very early infancy stages, and Twitch is established, it's ready to be used right now, I have a partnership on Twitch, I can stream in 720, 1080, whatever I want.
[03:54.26]I might stream on YouTube, eventually.
[03:57.26]Once it gets into like the adolescent stage.
[04:00.18]Maybe I'll switch over to YouTube and it'll be a little bit easier for me.
[04:02.80]But I don't know.
[04:03.48]I might do both.
[04:04.40]You might see a YouTube stream sometimes.
[04:06.12]Maybe you'll see a Twitch stream.
[04:07.95]I don't know.
[04:09.33]Keep it rolling.
[04:09.95]Keep it going.
[04:10.39]We get aliens.
[04:11.75]Aliens are coming to TF2.
[04:12.73]There's a UFO update or something that's coming.
[04:14.73]Invasion?
[04:15.27]I have no idea.
[04:16.21]All I know is that I was in Dust Bowl.
[04:18.01]Looked up.
[04:18.73]Saw the UFO.
[04:19.95]Shit my pants.
[04:21.11]And then went to Reddit and went to online and looking up all the information.
[04:24.42]When's it gonna be out?
[04:25.64]Oh my god.
[04:26.73]There's a lot of hype around it right now.
[04:28.67]And, yeah, that's... Alright, what's the next thing?
[04:31.79]What do we got?
[04:32.33]What's coming up next?
[04:33.61]I'm probably going to BlizzCon this year.
[04:36.03]I'm gonna try my absolute hardest to be there.
[04:38.98]Mainly because I didn't get to do anything, really, this year.
[04:41.34]I did PAX East, but that's it.
[04:43.42]And I love going to conventions.
[04:44.70]And because of this whole buying this place and moving in and all these busy things that have been going on the last few months, I didn't get to really do much.
[04:51.17]I couldn't go to PAX Prime.
[04:52.31]I couldn't go to E3.
[04:53.93]So I want to make up for that.
[04:54.85]I want to go to BlizzCon, and Overwatch is going to be there, so that's another huge reason to go.
[04:59.67]So if you see me there, then just say hello.
[05:01.47]I'll bring it up again before BlizzCon happens.
[05:03.59]I believe it's November 10th, November 9th.
[05:06.57]It's one of the first or second weeks of November is BlizzCon.
[05:10.32]But that's it!
[05:11.52]That's really all I have to say, I just wanted to give as many updates as I possibly could, because there's been a lot of shit going on.
[05:17.95]And I just wanted to make a five or six minute video condensing all these topics down, reiterate a couple of things, bring up some new stuff, and that sort of thing.
[05:26.03]So, thank you so much for watching, really appreciate it.
[05:28.39]Come to the Twitch stream,
[05:29.55]It's there.
[05:30.02]I don't know if I'm live right now.
[05:31.54]I might be.
[05:32.08]I might not be.
[05:33.20]But if you haven't followed and you're into that sort of thing, then go ahead and follow it.
[05:36.99]So thank you, guys.
[05:37.73]I'll see you all soon.
[05:38.73]Take care, everybody, and good night.
