[00:08.53]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10.67]It's Grandpa here.
[00:12.17]And today, gonna be playing some League of Legends.
[00:15.52]It's supposed to be really fun and really awesome.
[00:18.54]I don't know how to play the game.
[00:19.92]I have no idea what's happening.
[00:21.82]I just installed it.
[00:23.46]And those of you asking to see my face, I'm gonna show my fucking face.
[00:27.78]Just wait a few days, okay?
[00:29.82]It takes me a while to get on camera.
[00:32.09]And where am I going?
[00:34.04]Wait, what do you even do in this game?
[00:36.27]Is this like a puzzle game?
[00:37.57]I have no idea.
[00:39.51]I'm just gonna go this way.
[00:40.73]I have no clue.
[00:41.69]Oh, there it is.
[00:43.13]There's the action.
[00:44.03]There's the action right there, baby.
[00:48.36]Yes.
[00:49.20]This camera sucks.
[00:50.22]Get over here.
[00:50.72]Okay, right in the middle.
[00:52.44]The character I picked was a Mimimu.
[00:54.92]He's a mummy and he's a cool looking guy.
[00:59.83]Actually, he was one of the only free characters I could pick.
[01:02.89]But am I dying right now?
[01:05.09]What the fuck is going on?
[01:06.29]Am I getting killed?
[01:07.65]You have been slain.
[01:09.07]That's fucking bullshit.
[01:10.43]How am I supposed to know you could die in this game?
[01:12.61]I thought that guy was on my fucking team.
[01:16.25]Okay, I gotta help protect this lane.
[01:18.57]These two guys look like they're in some trouble.
[01:20.87]Don't worry.
[01:21.67]Grandpa's here to help protect the left lane.
[01:24.43]Just stay behind me.
[01:25.55]Don't be a hero.
[01:26.35]Don't get yourself killed.
[01:27.61]I'll take care of this.
[01:28.37]There's only three people here.
[01:29.95]Just stay back and get yourself some health.
[01:32.05]There's a guy in the top left corner.
[01:33.26]Gotta be careful of that guy.
[01:34.12]Let's see if I can sneak by.
[01:35.76]All right, I'm going for it.
[01:36.74]I'm going for the tower.
[01:37.86]I'm going for the fucking tower.
[01:39.30]There it is.
[01:39.62]Come on.
[01:40.14]Come on.
[01:40.48]Get there, Grandpa.
[01:41.30]Get there.
[01:41.62]This is you.
[01:42.32]It's all you, baby.
[01:43.98]You have been slain.
[01:45.52]What?
[01:48.03]Seriously, where am I?
[01:49.25]I have no idea where I am.
[01:51.47]I'm completely lost.
[01:52.69]What the fuck?
[01:54.29]I need a teammate to save me.
[01:55.59]Oh, no, no, no, teammate!
[01:56.59]No, no, no, Red!
[01:57.39]Red!
[01:58.05]Wait a second.
[01:59.28]Oh, God.
[02:00.30]This is a song we sing called You Can't Get Me.
[02:03.52]I'm next to the tower.
[02:04.90]You... Hey.
[02:05.52]Whoa, whoa, what the... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:06.68]Hey, what are you doing?
[02:07.76]Get out of here.
[02:08.46]Get the fuck out of here, dude.
[02:09.70]Come on.
[02:10.04]Let's... You have slain
[02:12.48]I did it!
[02:13.76]I actually just killed somebody!
[02:15.72]I killed that guy!
[02:16.72]I murdered that guy!
[02:18.36]Wow!
[02:20.20]I am the master of League of Legends!
[02:23.73]Can we seriously get this lady to stop talking?
[02:26.51]That's all she does is talk!
[02:28.09]Your ally has been slain.
[02:29.73]Your minions are under attack.
[02:32.35]Listen, I know how to play the game.
[02:34.17]If I needed your help, I would ask for it.
[02:36.27]Now shut the fuck up!
[02:38.65]Executed.
[02:42.30]What the hell is this?
[02:45.20]What is this?
[02:46.88]Are these items?
[02:49.04]I don't know what the hell any of this shit even does.
[02:51.20]So I'm just gonna buy it.
[02:53.95]Okay, buy that.
[02:55.03]I'll take this thing.
[02:57.07]I'll take one of these.
[02:58.77]I'll take one of these.
[03:00.45]And shit, I don't know, one of these.
[03:02.43]I don't know.
[03:04.49]That's done.
[03:05.27]Done.
[03:06.01]Done.
[03:07.82]Oh, jeez.
[03:08.64]These are skill points.
[03:10.42]I can't believe I didn't put any points in.
[03:11.88]I'm like level 7 or something.
[03:13.24]I'll put these in.
[03:13.98]Oh, what an idiot.
[03:16.40]Grandpa, you can be a real idiot sometimes.
[03:18.46]I gotta see what these even do.
[03:19.71]Hold on.
[03:19.99]Just go over there.
[03:21.67]Um, tantrum.
[03:23.47]Amumu takes 6 reduced damage from physical attacks.
[03:27.51]And when I turn it on, what do I have?
[03:29.89]It deals 125...
[03:33.08]Okay, you know what?
[03:33.94]I'm done.
[03:34.52]I'm done with this game.
[03:35.38]It's over.
[03:36.30]I'm not playing this game anymore.
[03:37.78]It's way too complicated.
[03:40.18]And that's it.
[03:41.00]So, uh, thanks for watching and see you later.
[03:44.28]I don't know how you play that.
[03:45.24]I mean, you need a PhD.
[03:47.12]You need a fucking PhD to play that game.
[03:48.98]You seriously do.
[03:50.46]You better go to law school.
[03:52.32]You need to get a doctorate in law.
[03:55.45]If that's even possible, I'm not even sure.
