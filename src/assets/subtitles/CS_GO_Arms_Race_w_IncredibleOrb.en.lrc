[01:49.57]Bought Tom going hard.
[01:51.51]I'm afraid to go over there, man.
[01:53.29]I feel like he's gonna shoot me in the face.
[01:57.36]Or that'll happen.
[01:58.34]I'll just drop down like Spider-Man and get myself killed.
[02:01.64]Oh god, where am I?
[02:03.93]Where am I going?
[02:06.69]No!
[02:07.69]What are you doing in the spawn?
[02:09.23]What are you doing in the spawn, Jeremy?
[02:10.31]I'm spawning.
[02:12.14]What else do you do in spawn?
[02:13.30]Yeah, I thought you were spawn camping, dude.
[02:14.94]What are you doing in spawn is the real question.
[02:17.86]I was chasing... I was looking for you guys.
[02:19.94]Wow, you... You were nowhere.
[02:22.66]That was just BS right there.
[02:23.89]I don't believe it.
[02:27.19]I called BS with that one.
[02:30.93]Oh, I'm doing great.
[02:33.56]Oh, God.
[02:36.46]Floppy disk.
[02:38.40]Fucking floppy disk.
[02:39.34]Thanks for standing still, Bot Bill.
[02:41.00]Give me the free headshot.
[02:43.24]You're getting free kills off of the bots?
[02:44.73]Come on, dude.
[02:46.39]You don't want to be that guy.
[02:47.49]Oh!
[02:48.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[02:50.53]Total commit.
[02:51.51]Floppy disk, I swear.
[02:52.71]Thanks, Bot Bill.
[02:54.69]How many free kills are you getting on Bot Bill right now?
[02:59.16]I got at least two free kills off Bot Bill.
[03:03.68]So not fair.
[03:05.22]Kidding me, what?
[03:05.66]Get out of here.
[03:07.00]Wait, is this our spawn?
[03:08.58]Yeah, I think this is... Wow, I'm in the wrong spawn.
[03:10.50]Did they switch?
[03:11.46]They might switch.
[03:13.00]No, I don't think... This is not Call of Duty, dude.
[03:15.51]No, they don't switch, no.
[03:18.33]Who's that?
[03:19.33]Okay, Wretch.
[03:20.61]With a big booty.
[03:21.83]That's the picture.
[03:23.23]Yeah.
[03:23.59]That's a nice booty you got there, Wretch.
[03:25.39]Oh, come on.
[03:26.05]No, no, no, no.
[03:28.24]No, no, no, what?
[03:29.34]I just got... Don't be upset.
[03:30.36]Hit the face.
[03:33.36]God, with that aim!
[03:34.46]Is it a bot or no?
[03:37.84]No, that was you!
[03:38.56]Oh.
[03:39.42]Oh.
[03:40.04]Oh.
[03:41.76]Feel it.
[03:42.60]Feel it.
[03:43.18]Hold on, let me trash talk for a bit.
[03:46.38]Oh, get on my level.
[03:47.62]Oh.
[03:49.30]Are you mad?
[03:49.90]Are you mad?
[03:50.50]Hey, Bot Bill, stand still again so I can get some kills.
[03:54.02]Oh, somebody just saved me.
[03:55.22]It may have been Bot Bill.
[03:58.87]Bot Bill, is that you?
[03:59.79]I'm on the pistols right now, and I'm getting screwed on.
[04:03.29]Oh, is that you?
[04:10.70]Good aim, dude.
[04:12.56]Yeah, I was aiming.
[04:15.84]I hate these guns, these LMGs.
[04:18.16]Bot Bill, Bot Bill's mine.
[04:21.72]It's mine.
[04:22.16]Oh, wait, it's on my team.
[04:23.88]Never mind.
[04:25.16]Whoa!
[04:27.47]That big booty of wretches is getting all kinds of kills on me.
[04:30.99]Make it stop.
[04:34.46]Where do you come from?
[04:36.72]I came from behind.
[04:37.58]I don't know.
[04:38.56]I think I dropped down or I either spawned down there.
[04:40.66]Behind.
[04:41.30]Yeah, you're looking good from behind, Jerma.
[04:46.02]Looking real good.
[04:47.92]You look beautiful.
[04:50.19]Beautiful.
[04:52.87]I can't believe it.
[04:54.43]I can't believe I didn't get that guy in his face.
[05:00.94]Oh, I wish that was you.
[05:01.82]I wish that was you so bad.
[05:06.50]But no.
[05:08.14]Oh, too many people.
[05:10.12]Too many people.
[05:14.87]I'm stuck on a little, like, dipshit pistol.
[05:19.69]You're probably caught up with me, dude.
[05:21.43]Look at all these... Your whole team is over here.
[05:25.05]Don't shoot me, Jerma.
[05:26.67]No!
[05:27.53]Fall damage.
[05:28.21]Are you kidding me?
[05:29.90]Oh, that's embarrassing.
[05:32.00]I've got to reset a level?
[05:37.36]Oh, mediocre, you... Suck on it.
[05:41.50]Suck on the justice.
[05:43.28]I would have had so much joy from that.
[05:46.42]That is what we call the justice, P9.
[05:50.22]Alright, alright, time to take over.
[05:51.98]This guy Rio.
[05:57.48]AD and like a pro.
[06:00.55]It's going to be fun.
[06:01.31]Man, oh man.
[06:05.75]I just have to wait.
[06:08.54]And then strike!
[06:10.08]Get out of here!
[06:11.00]Oh no!
[06:11.68]Wow.
[06:12.72]That was you, huh?
[06:13.92]Trying to go for the knife kill on me?
[06:16.34]That wasn't me.
[06:17.12]No!
[06:19.74]Second and third though, man.
[06:22.25]Ain't too bad for the first game.
[06:23.39]Let's go to the... Let's go to the monastery.
[06:28.72]Alright, okay, here we go.
[06:29.38]Let's do it.
[06:30.32]Time to be fancy.
[06:33.28]Going up right.
[06:33.92]Going up two o'clock.
[06:35.28]Two o'clock.
[06:35.68]Best starting route in the game.
[06:41.47]Best starting route in the game.
[06:43.39]Yeah.
[06:45.21]Watch my videos for tips and tricks.
[06:47.27]What the hell was that?
[06:50.66]It's almost like I was shooting a time crisis machine that wasn't calibrated.
[06:56.08]My shots were going like five feet to the right.
[07:01.09]Somebody at the arcade didn't calibrate the goddamn light gun.
[07:05.32]That's what it looks like.
[07:09.02]Ooh, I'm getting some kills, not gonna lie.
[07:10.84]I'm doing solid.
[07:13.66]Camping their spawns like a boss.
[07:16.07]Get that guy.
[07:18.03]Yeah.
[07:20.19]Camping their spawn like a boss.
[07:22.73]Like a B.O.
[07:25.83]I'm scared.
[07:26.55]Oh.
[07:26.75]I just came from the spawn.
[07:28.45]I just shot you because I was scared.
[07:30.64]I don't know.
[07:30.92]I thought you were like an enemy.
[07:31.64]I'm scared.
[07:32.14]You're like trigger happy.
[07:33.36]There we go.
[07:36.86]I'm doing some damage.
[07:37.86]Not gonna lie.
[07:39.32]Bot Chris playing like a badass.
[07:41.70]No.
[07:43.12]That was like my first death in like ever.
[07:45.44]Yeah.
[07:45.82]In ever.
[07:47.24]Well, not forever, but in this game.
[07:49.58]How did you kill that guy and I didn't?
[07:52.44]Hey, dude.
[07:53.76]Don't be mad.
[07:54.72]Get even.
[07:57.68]Not gonna lie that actually startled me I actually got startled by what just happened.
[08:12.98]Oh God this guy What is he doing?
[08:17.07]I just doubled another kill!
[08:20.79]Dude, I'm still at level 3!
[08:23.83]I should be at least at level 6.
[08:26.01]Oh, finally, I get a shot on somebody.
[08:31.64]Come on, Chris.
[08:33.06]There we go.
[08:35.58]Come on, Chris.
[08:37.64]Come on, Chris.
[08:39.60]Where they at?
[08:41.12]Oh, behind!
[08:41.82]Behind!
[08:42.36]Behind!
[08:44.86]Chasing down my butt.
[08:46.36]Ooh, hello.
[08:47.88]I'll take you down.
[08:48.62]Where is everybody?
[08:49.61]I want to play the game.
[08:52.73]I'm killing them, dude.
[08:53.69]Yeah, I got them.
[08:55.21]I'm on an 18 streak.
[08:56.31]I'm doing pretty solid.
[08:57.87]Ooh.
[08:59.91]Lucky me.
[09:01.53]That guy was just getting lit up.
[09:02.72]I love when there's like four dudes shooting at the same guy.
[09:07.02]I know.
[09:07.86]I forgot I died.
[09:08.42]Ooh.
[09:09.56]Ooh.
[09:11.94]Apparently he has phantom bullets that were going through you and hitting me in the face.
[09:16.16]But I think I died, so... Phantom of the Opera bullets.
[09:22.42]Oh, that's a lot of BS right there.
[09:25.59]I tried.
[09:25.95]I jumped on and got the jump on him.
[09:28.61]It didn't even matter.
[09:44.29]No!
[09:45.29]Living room set, you piece of shit!
[09:47.61]What happened?
[09:48.47]What the hell is this guy... Dude, this guy's just sitting... Oh, no, no, no.
[09:53.35]Like, heaven forbid I steal one of yours.
[09:55.63]Yeah, that's not... Heaven forbid.
[09:57.05]Heaven forbid you steal, like, a dozen of mine.
[10:00.95]That's not fair.
[10:01.83]You stole, like... I don't want to play with you, dude.
[10:03.93]Dude, you stole, like, a Crayola Crayon box set worth of kills from me.
[10:07.77]There was at least 12 in that box.
[10:09.53]I want my orange and I want my blue and purple back.
[10:13.25]You're not getting it back.
[10:14.89]Oh, well, then I'm gonna scream.
[10:17.58]You're Ben Roos, man.
[10:18.92]Ooh, look what I'm on.
[10:22.92]Yeah, living room set, baby.
[10:26.22]Who wants it?
[10:26.62]$7.99?
[10:26.64]$7.99? $7.99?
[10:30.44]Holy crap, no!
[10:31.57]I think somebody's on knife.
[10:33.87]Yeah, it was almost the end of the game.
[10:35.85]He almost got me.
[10:37.67]No!
[10:38.59]I could have gone with that knife.
[10:39.75]I'm terrified right now.
[10:40.81]I'm terrified.
[10:41.43]Where is he?
[10:42.87]Yes!
[10:42.99]Did you get him?
[10:45.06]On the AFK.
[10:47.66]I had to get it.
[10:48.26]There we go.
[10:51.56]Well, I want to thank my parents for raising me properly.
[10:54.36]I want to thank Jerma for being a good sport while I stole all his kills.
[10:57.73]And GG.
[10:57.95]That's pretty much it.
[11:00.78]GG.
[11:01.79]GG.
