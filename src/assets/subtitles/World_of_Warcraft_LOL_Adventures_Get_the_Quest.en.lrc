[00:13.91]Don't worry we can do it What does that look like Oh, do you need some help don't worry I'll help you
[00:31.38]Hey, what is going on guys?
[00:32.60]Welcome to my first ever quest tutorial video.
[00:35.50]And what's going to happen here is we're going to teach you how to do a quest.
[00:39.53]The most important thing in this is you want to get the quest.
[00:42.51]Which is really easy, there's a quest giver around the world.
[00:45.19]So after you get the quest, you do the quest, and then you complete the quest.
[00:50.29]And that's really all there is to it.
[00:51.86]The thing in this game is really, really fun and interesting.
[00:55.02]Once you get it, once you get the quest...
[01:06.46]What a beautiful land this is, wouldn't you say?
[01:08.34]The sights, the sounds, the smells.
[01:20.04]Uldum is full of treasures, my friend.
[01:23.35]Treasure.
[01:25.75]I like that.
[01:27.97]Yes, some are easy for even simple men to discern, while others require wisdom to see.
[01:35.67]What the hell am I doing?
[01:40.35]Why am I doing this?
[01:44.49]I knew that for that last one you were literally just going to do what you did and just shout.
[01:49.21]Well, no, because on my screen, I'm sitting next to this guy and he's telling me his life story and I just don't care.
[01:58.12]Well, not that I don't care, my character doesn't care.
[02:00.22]At least he's sitting here like a stone.
[02:04.76]Dude, when you see this video, look at my guy's hands.
[02:08.32]He is like, he's sitting there like he's holding on.
[02:11.00]Dude, it looks ridiculous.
[02:13.12]Please put that back in.
[02:15.28]Dude, my guy's hands.
[02:19.40]Oh, he's like, it looks like he's got broken arms and he's in casts.
[02:24.68]What?
[02:25.36]This is a bumpy ride, by the way.
[02:26.78]Who's manning this son of a bitch?
[02:29.13]Okay, so they're weakened.
[02:31.41]They're weak.
[02:34.67]Oh, man.
[02:37.01]And it only took like an hour and ten minutes.
[02:41.11]You better queue up.
[02:42.45]Hit that button.
[02:44.76]Oh, you son of a bitch.
[02:47.98]This guy better queue up or I'm gonna be pissed.
[02:52.72]It's probably the same guy!
[02:53.84]Oh, thank god.
[02:55.86]I was about to freak out.
[02:59.28]Hey, look at that.
[03:02.36]Where the hell are we?
[03:04.40]Rimbatol.
[03:08.20]Oh, Ahila lagged out.
[03:12.46]Oh, joy.
[03:17.90]Look at this face of disappointment.
[03:21.67]He is disappointed right now.
[03:25.67]When the hell did I make my guy look this ugly?
[03:27.67]He looks like Santa Claus Hulk Hogan right now.
[03:30.59]When the hell did I do this?
[03:33.46]Hello.
[03:35.38]Hey!
[03:36.68]Sorry I can't get in.
[03:38.18]How?
[03:38.42]It says that I need to do the stupid quest before I'm allowed in.
[03:45.00]What?
[03:46.74]You can ro- Really?
[03:51.97]Yeah.
[03:53.17]Jesus.
[03:53.59]Okay.
[03:56.79]But you could get in this one without the quest.
[03:59.17]Yeah.
[04:06.03]Oh, and here we go.
[04:07.71]This is the journey.
[04:09.05]This is what it all comes down to.
[04:10.73]That guy is huge, man.
[04:15.08]Can I, like, just... I'm just, like, attacking this guy.
[04:21.04]Oh, that guy died.
[04:22.66]I killed, like, one of those, like, marines.
[04:28.35]I have to fight this guy?
[04:29.63]How the hell am I gonna fight this guy by myself?
[04:33.81]Oh, those, like... I think those marines helped me.
[04:36.39]Let's hope so.
[04:37.57]Come on, you.
[04:38.82]Don't worry, I got my dogs.
[04:39.84]Whoa!
[04:40.74]Lasers everywhere!
[04:42.78]Get him!
[04:43.80]Get him!
[04:45.62]Kill this son of a bitch.
[04:46.52]Kill him!
[04:48.52]Everything you got.
[04:49.26]Heroism.
[04:50.62]Super bomb move.
[04:55.66]Oh man, oh man.
[04:59.54]Intense battle sequence.
[05:01.12]Get behind the Colossus.
[05:02.14]Oh!
[05:07.28]Alright, he did like a super smash.
[05:09.56]This guy is toast.
[05:10.50]Are you kidding me?
[05:14.62]This guy is toast.
[05:17.12]He is really, really cool looking though, I will say.
[05:18.88]This is one of the coolest things I've seen so far in this zone.
[05:22.34]Ow!
[05:24.22]Bitch.
[05:27.78]Oh, and that's it.
[05:28.92]See ya.
[05:30.64]See ya later, dude.
[05:33.36]Why is he not dying?
[05:35.48]Oh, he needs, like, two more DPS done.
[05:40.24]I did it.
[05:43.22]Wait, these guys are attacking me now.
[05:44.66]Oh, screw... No, they're not.
[05:46.00]I'm wrong.
[05:48.10]No, I can't use any of it.
[05:51.63]I'm just gonna take... Wait, what's the most expensive thing?
[05:54.83]This... Why, not very much.
[05:57.67]Oh!
[05:58.95]Oh!
[05:59.81]I did it!
[06:00.19]I did all the quests in Uldum!
[06:04.81]I am the quest master!
[06:06.41]I am the master of the quests!
[06:09.72]And you cannot defeat me!
