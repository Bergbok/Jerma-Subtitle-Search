[00:08.94]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:11.02]Jermock here with Super Meat Boy Mondays!
[00:15.12]In this episode, we're gonna tackle the Salt Factory, Chapter 3.
[00:18.10]So what do you say we get statted and watch the cutscene?
[00:23.78]Mm-mm!
[00:25.76]Alright, so he's got my pig girlfriend.
[00:27.36]She looked like a pig from behind right there.
[00:32.64]He turned into the moon.
[00:34.41]Went into the Salt Factory.
[00:37.39]I love this music.
[00:39.63]This is, like, one of my favorite songs in the whole game.
[00:41.77]I don't know why.
[00:43.05]Just like that, like... Here we go.
[00:50.40]This is where it's gonna start to get really, really bad on the rage front, so let's see if I can't just pull this off.
[00:57.72]Hmm.
[00:57.90]Can I get it?
[00:58.42]Yes!
[01:07.17]No!
[01:07.53]I can't!
[01:08.11]I should've just jumped over it, I'm an idiot.
[01:10.99]No, screw the bandaid.
[01:12.19]I don't need it.
[01:12.61]There it is!
[01:18.70]Woohoo!
[01:19.02]Ooh, we go up or down, I don't even remember.
[01:23.26]It's been long time since I've played this game.
[01:26.18]Looks like we're going up.
[01:33.77]Level complete!
[01:36.01]Is this... I can walk on this, right?
[01:37.29]Okay, good.
[01:38.49]I was gonna say, hopefully I can walk on this.
[01:41.21]I... Jump!
[01:43.17]Jump!
[01:45.07]Let's go, Super Meat Boy!
[01:46.47]Show them what you got!
[01:50.71]Ah, you know what?
[01:51.31]For a second I thought that was in the background, like the foreground, like I couldn't run into it.
[01:56.42]I thought it was part of the scenery.
[02:00.26]Now I know.
[02:01.08]See, now you...
[02:03.51]Alright, this- oh my god, I'm like shifting in my seat, I gotta get like comfortable.
[02:07.19]Let's go.
[02:14.23]Get the keep!
[02:16.83]Alright, nice and easy here.
[02:18.45]No- no bologna.
[02:20.90]No bologna and cheese sandwiches here.
[02:25.68]Alright, now I know that happens.
[02:29.46]It's good to know.
[02:32.10]Run!
[02:33.90]Oh, jeez, I forgot that happened.
[02:37.23]See, that's definitely the worst part about playing this over again, just blindly.
[02:40.45]I forget all these levels.
[02:41.99]Now I know that happens, so I can... God, the noises that are made.
[02:50.37]Warp zone, warp zone, warp zone.
[02:51.85]Can I get in there?
[02:54.41]How the hell do I get in there?
[02:56.61]Oh, for the love of Pete.
[02:57.91]Whatever.
[02:58.23]Hold on, here we go.
[03:01.24]Wooo!
[03:03.70]Oh, no, not that.
[03:08.16]Ninja Meat Boy.
[03:09.12]20 points to who knows what that is.
[03:20.36]Oh, let's keep it skiing here.
[03:25.05]Tribes Ascend.
[03:25.81]Just like tribes.
[03:29.37]It's all about the skiing.
[03:31.41]A plus, baby.
[03:34.12]Hmm, okay.
[03:35.18]This is my favorite part, I love this.
[03:44.21]Yeah!
[03:47.47]Boomtown!
[03:48.23]Oh, I forgot, oh yeah, these things.
[03:49.37]You have to kind of dodge these things, they shoot a little slow, but they have homing capabilities.
[03:56.35]So you want to biahoo, and then you want to biaha, and then you want to biaha!
[04:01.02]Ah.
[04:01.86]Otto, what do you want?
[04:02.90]Otto just walked in my room.
[04:04.71]Which means my door is open.
[04:05.91]Which means the other big dog, the big, gross, smelly dog can get in here now.
[04:09.43]And I don't want that.
[04:11.74]Not that I don't love my dog, but he's, uh... He is big, and he is, like, gross.
[04:18.06]We have to- here's a little quick story about that dog.
[04:20.82]So the big, huge dog you've probably seen in videos past, we have to give him to, like, the groomer every, like, couple months or every, like, few weeks.
[04:30.54]Because he's just so big and just- yeah, and disgusting.
[04:34.36]He just stinks sometimes.
[04:36.86]But he's a big, lovable ox.
[04:38.31]We love him.
[04:39.29]His name's Boo-Boo.
[04:41.41]Oh my god, that's, like, the fifth time that's happened.
[04:43.93]Alright, enough.
[04:44.65]Enough!
[04:45.19]Enough!
[04:46.39]My ship sails in the morning.
[04:47.99]I wonder what's for breakfast.
[04:49.53]Come on.
[04:53.65]Oh, goddammit!
[05:02.91]Come on.
[05:06.73]You see, they have to explode.
[05:08.14]If you don't get them to blow up, then you're in big trouble.
[05:11.40]Like that, see?
[05:12.26]There was like, oh!
[05:14.66]Please, god, no!
[05:18.08]Okay, time to, I really gotta pay attention here.
[05:24.77]No, oh my god, I'm gonna throw the frickin' controller into the wall.
[05:30.77]Come on.
[05:31.01]Alright, wait for another one, good.
[05:35.75]Now, god in heaven!
[05:41.89]Go.
[05:43.44]I'm sick of this.
[05:46.74]There, that's it.
[05:47.28]You're supposed to turn and run.
[05:49.36]And then do it again.
[05:51.24]And then do it again.
[05:52.74]Thank you very much.
[05:54.16]Holy crap.
[05:56.10]Oh, no, I didn't want to skip that.
[05:57.38]Crap.
[05:58.16]I wanted to see all those deaths.
[05:59.98]I'm sorry if you wanted to see that, too.
[06:01.46]I apologize.
[06:03.84]But I have such an itchy trigger finger in this game, I just have to go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[06:06.92]Oh, oh.
[06:14.48]Gotta stay in the middle, gotta stay in the middle.
[06:16.64]Yay!
[06:19.00]A+.
[06:20.50]Yeah!
[06:23.04]The bend.
[06:24.26]Welcome to the bend.
[06:27.71]Bender bending Rodriguez.
[06:30.17]Bite my shiny metal ass.
[06:34.31]Oh no.
[06:37.65]Me and Fry are gonna go do some terrorizing.
[06:42.25]Come on, Professor.
[06:44.21]I don't think I'm going to do.
[06:45.41]Why do all my voices sound the same?
[06:49.89]Every voice is just like Grandpa.
[06:54.19]Whatever.
[06:56.91]Just go.
[06:57.47]You know what?
[06:57.77]I'm just gonna go.
[06:58.53]Go!
[07:00.02]That didn't work so well.
[07:02.89]Gotta wait here... I don't... This is the word... Meat Boy levels where you have to be patient.
[07:09.15]I cannot do it.
[07:10.45]When you gotta be patient, I can't do this.
[07:12.43]I cannot stand it.
[07:14.65]I just wanna go as fast as I... That really just killed me.
[07:19.17]Gotta go as humanly possible, as fast as I possibly humanly, humanly can.
[07:25.91]No, come here!
[07:29.84]No, my... Oh, at least I'm not dying.
[07:33.90]Oh my god!
[07:36.40]What the hell?
[07:38.82]Alright, that's not gonna happen again.
[07:41.71]Told ya.
[07:46.29]Get the girl.
[07:47.85]Take her back to mom and dad's.
[07:49.99]Have some dinner.
[07:51.41]Meet the fam.
[07:55.23]Oh boy, this thing moves.
[07:56.19]This thing moves and yet it moves.
[07:58.79]Isn't that a game?
[07:59.39]I think that's a game.
[08:06.46]Oh, crap.
[08:11.30]Otto?
[08:12.12]There we go.
[08:21.11]Hello, my queen.
[08:25.03]Rustic.
[08:27.15]Sounds pretty rustic to me.
[08:28.89]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[08:32.31]Oh, god.
[08:33.77]Okay, good thing I didn't
[08:37.44]Just gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[08:38.70]Alright, getting to the boss here.
[08:43.00]I think the boss is... If I remember, the boss in this level is... difficult.
[08:49.62]And I'm probably gonna use so many lives at that boss, it's not even funny.
[08:57.56]Oh my god, how am I gonna get this?
[09:03.71]Like that.
[09:04.27]That's how you're gonna get it.
[09:05.13]And you're not gonna die here.
[09:08.85]It's all about the patience.
[09:10.13]Just have patience, my young Padawan, and you will be victorious.
[09:14.77]Don't go yet.
[09:15.63]Okay, go!
[09:17.33]Yes!
[09:19.15]Alright, well, right after beating that level, we, uh... just had a crash, but that's okay.
[09:25.38]Back, ready to do it again!
[09:27.86]Come on, bro.
[09:28.50]Come on, bro!
[09:30.60]Oh, look at these dodges!
[09:33.46]Dude, why am I playing the Super Mario Bros.
[09:35.80]2 level where you have to dig down?
[09:38.66]I forget what you have to do here.
[09:40.54]Oh my god, what do I do?
[09:41.32]Oh my god!
[09:43.92]Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second.
[09:45.68]I totally forget what you have to do here!
[09:50.28]What is go- Oh, no no no!
[09:52.36]Okay, I remember, I remember.
[09:53.50]You go through here.
[09:54.22]Okay.
[09:55.70]There we go.
[09:58.02]For a second I was just, by brain, had no idea what was going on.
[10:02.60]Would you just get in there, you sloppy bastard?
[10:08.46]And this is gonna be another Byahu.
[10:10.34]Yes it is.
[10:13.26]Oh, hi.
[10:13.72]Uh, Byahu?
[10:18.18]Now I know you.
[10:19.75]I will probably say... I... HATE these things.
[10:25.01]These are the absolute worst things in the game.
[10:28.83]These stupid missile launches.
[10:33.65]Oh, you're gonna take this?
[10:34.55]Come on.
[10:36.09]I'll jump over you all day.
[10:41.16]Yes!
[10:42.70]Okay.
[10:43.68]Hopefully I don't crash at the boss.
[10:45.36]Because that would not be good.
[10:49.52]Brownie.
[10:51.32]I gotta go, gotta go.
[10:52.42]Help me!
[10:53.42]Please!
[10:53.80]Oh, you're here!
[10:54.48]Of course I'm here, you're my girlfriend.
[10:56.38]Excuse me, you can't touch that.
[10:58.06]I will be hitting this button right now.
[11:00.45]Or pulling this lever, same thing.
[11:02.35]Here comes a toilet.
[11:04.83]Who's it gonna be?
[11:06.33]Oh my god.
[11:07.51]What the hell is going on?
[11:08.79]What is this?
[11:10.69]It's... Oh, it stinks!
[11:13.79]What is it?
[11:15.82]Who is that?
[11:17.92]Hey, guys, it's me.
[11:20.08]Brownie.
[11:21.56]Alright, let's go.
[11:23.62]You have to beat this guy in a race, that's all I remember.
[11:27.84]Oh, you are done.
[11:29.26]I... Come on!
[11:31.91]Oh, no!
[11:34.49]I gotta be right up his ass the whole time.
[11:37.97]I can hear, like, my phone ringing.
[11:39.37]You guys hear that?
[11:41.37]Whoever's calling me right now, I can't talk.
[11:44.42]Fighting Brownie.
[11:45.94]Well, not really fighting him, but racing him.
[11:50.62]Oh, you just got passed.
[11:52.26]You just got passed, man.
[11:55.55]You got passed.
[11:57.85]Just don't screw this up.
[11:59.91]Oh, what a... Come on.
[12:02.75]No!
[12:06.45]Damn it!
[12:07.60]I was way ahead of him, too.
[12:09.98]I was running circles around them.
[12:11.44]I have to stay way ahead.
[12:15.28]This is where you gotta get some ground, right here.
[12:18.15]Down here.
[12:19.85]And don't be a stupid idiot.
[12:22.55]No, see right there I screwed that up.
[12:24.61]Screwed it up.
[12:25.77]Oh my god, totally screwed everything up.
[12:30.85]Go, go.
[12:31.49]Oh, who's talking to me on Skype?
[12:33.47]I'm getting all these, like, notifications.
[12:35.58]Come on, you bastard!
[12:37.18]What?
[12:37.50]What?
[12:37.90]What?
[12:38.68]Okay.
[12:39.56]Thank God.
[12:42.42]I've made it.
[12:44.56]Please don't kill me.
[12:46.36]I don't want to... I'll get you, buddy.
[12:47.57]Don't worry.
[12:48.61]Thank you, man.
[12:50.23]I appreciate that.
[12:53.35]You'll never take him.
[12:54.19]I'm gonna throw a little brick in his face, you see.
[12:55.85]You'll never take him.
[12:59.05]Dude, what are you doing?
[13:00.09]Leave him alone!
[13:02.73]I love you.
[13:04.32]I love you too, man.
[13:05.82]You're gonna get it.
[13:06.72]Hiya, how are ya?
[13:07.64]You're dead when I see you, man.
[13:08.96]I'm jumping over there.
[13:09.68]I'm gonna kick the absolute crap out of you.
[13:12.22]Not if I press this button.
[13:15.52]I'll just throw it at you.
[13:20.11]Alright, guys.
[13:21.93]That's Chapter 3 in the bag.
[13:24.91]The Salt Factory.
[13:26.81]The Salt and Sugar Factory.
[13:29.49]And hell is next, chapter four.
[13:31.99]Let's see how good I do there.
[13:36.09]But in the meantime, of course, enjoy the rest of your day or night, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[13:41.11]And of course, take care, everybody.
