[00:47.52]The Tower of the Goat was once key to the treasure of the gold buried underneath.
[00:55.11]Mortimus, the gray goat, held the tea to the tower for generations.
[01:02.26]And Excalibur, the black and white goat, would... Somebody on the computer over there?

[01:33.47]Wanna see what I used to do on the trampoline, guys?
[01:36.11]I'm going very high.
[01:37.29]This, uh... Hold on, this does not seem to be right.
[01:41.77]Nobody can really jump this high on a trampoline.
[01:45.15]Oh, catch me!
[01:46.09]Catch me, please!
[01:47.09]Help!

[01:57.26]I wanted the hot dogs.
[02:00.60]What?
[02:02.14]I was trying to kick the thing over there and it didn't even work.
[02:05.72]You know what?
[02:06.04]It is going to work.
[02:08.03]I'll make it work.
[02:11.83]He's flying.
[02:13.11]He's flying.
[02:14.33]And he's on fire.
[02:16.67]Oh.
[02:18.63]And these people are all still dancing.
[02:21.27]Do you see what just happened to the guy that was hosting the event?
[02:25.17]What kind of dance is this?
[02:29.84]I've never seen anybody do this dance unless you were a toddler.
[02:34.24]These people are doing the I'm a toddler learning how to dance to like Mickey Mouse music.
[02:43.49]Uh, honey, can you just go check on the greenhouse and make sure my petunias are in line?
[02:48.73]Oh, sure thing, honey.
[02:50.25]Oh, the glass doesn't break.
[02:53.23]I've got your favorite breakfast cereal waiting for you.
[02:57.50]It's Pop-Tarts!
[03:00.52]Oh, Pop-Tarts?
[03:01.28]Where are they?
[03:04.06]I hate going grocery shopping.
[03:05.48]I always have to go grocery shopping.
[03:07.22]It sucks.
[03:08.36]I'm going to get Coca-Cola Classic.
[03:10.01]That's like my favorite.
[03:11.31]And I'm going to get Doritos, potato chips.
[03:13.47]Those are good, too.
[03:15.03]I also want... What else do I want?
[03:18.54]I guess I could use a little bit of ham.
[03:20.62]Do they have ham here?
[03:21.64]I don't even know.
[03:22.36]Maybe.
[03:23.28]Excuse me.
[03:24.80]Sir, do you have ham?
[03:26.26]Oh, he's not here anymore.
[03:28.20]Oh, she's dead.
[03:30.84]Frodo, you must take the goblins out of the cave of mystery.
[03:37.56]And you must... You shall not pass into it fast enough.
[03:41.70]You can go first.
[03:43.60]Because best friends let their best friends go first on the slide.
[03:48.70]Okay, have fun.
[03:52.82]Have fun on the slide.
[03:54.44]Wee, this is so much fun.
[04:01.00]Woohoo!
[04:09.13]Oh, whoa, sorry, I'm sorry, I'll pay for that, I'll pay for that.
[04:12.51]I'll make sure you get like an extra monitor, a 27-incher, not just a 22-incher, whatever that is.
[04:18.85]Who are you, Bill?
[04:19.48]How's life?
[04:20.66]How's the kids?
[04:22.62]Yeah, the kids are good, huh?
[04:23.72]Yeah, that's great.
[04:26.08]Everybody expects me to just trash this place.
[04:30.40]But you know what?
[04:32.13]I think I'm going to have some self-control.
[04:34.37]Because I could just trash this place right now.
[04:40.13]And it's really starting to build up that I really want to do it.
[04:44.86]But I think I'm gonna hold back just a little bit right now.
[04:48.94]Get out before I change my mind.
[04:52.12]Fuck you!
[05:03.43]Hello, sir.
[05:05.93]Welcome to the goat station.
[05:09.29]Did I tell you that today was baseball day at the gas station?
[05:18.89]Thank you for coming.
[05:20.43]Hey Mortimer, welcome to the party.
[05:23.15]Hey Frank, how are you?
[05:26.30]What are you cooking on the grill?
[05:29.40]We've got some various meats that we are cooking here on the grill.
[05:34.18]That better not be goat meat.
[05:38.06]If it's goat meat, I'll be upset with you.
[05:41.43]Well, it is lamb.
[05:44.91]My family, we eat lamb.
[05:46.25]Same difference.
[05:49.01]Come here.
[05:50.31]Come here.
[05:51.45]Oh.
[05:52.61]Lee.
[05:53.03]This is like Katamari Damacy.
[05:58.60]How much stuff can I pick up?
[06:06.46]Whoa.
[06:06.96]Whoa.
[06:07.85]Whoa.
[06:08.89]Whoa.
