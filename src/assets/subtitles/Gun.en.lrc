[08:13.96]Press C to enter quick draw mode.
[08:15.44]Press C to continue.
[08:20.20]There actually is a fucking... What is this field of view?
[08:32.54]Did I do a good job?
[08:36.12]Why does every single one of these games have Deadeye?
[08:43.06]I don't understand.
[08:46.24]Try it again.
[08:46.64]Okay, well this time I'm actually gonna do it.
[08:50.46]What happened?
[08:52.20]There we go.
[08:56.40]Nice.
[08:57.38]Try to get all these.
[08:58.22]I'm still in it.
[09:03.16]What is it with game developers?
[09:04.16]Okay, so like, every single Wild West game.
[09:06.44]Ever.
[09:08.14]Use A and D to switch targets.
[09:14.62]This is just the Duck Dynasty game, guys.
[09:18.87]It actually is.
[09:19.77]You just snap to target.
[09:21.13]What's next?
[09:22.11]We're burning daylight.
[09:23.83]Let's go hunt us some elk.
[09:25.57]Alright.
[09:27.75]This really is just the Aimbot Duck Dynasty.
[09:30.25]By point, what I was saying is... So every single one of these games that have ever come out... Why do we all have superpowers where we can slow time down?
[09:46.53]Well, that was easy.
[09:50.73]Canteen.
[09:51.11]Press G to drink from flask to refill health.
[09:56.47]No, I don't have any health to refill.
[09:57.75]Follow close and keep quiet.
[10:02.22]15 FPS.
[10:02.88]Don't fall off.
[10:04.16]Don't fall off the ledge.
[10:05.98]Alright, well.
[10:09.24]There's nothing to fall off.
[10:10.02]There's a path.
[10:12.67]Left alt to switch weapons.
[10:14.75]Okay.
[10:15.95]Is there aim down sights?
[10:16.83]No, that's a knife.
[10:17.55]Remember, don't fall off the ledge.
[10:22.27]Remember, don't fall off this ledge.
[10:25.58]You'll spook the herd.
[10:37.76]Okay, it's very literal.
[10:43.80]The game just ends.
[10:44.70]Okay.
[10:45.78]Okay, Z to zoom.
[10:46.70]When do I need to bag?
[10:47.32]Oh, one of these.
[10:48.92]Got him.
[11:15.35]Doing good, so far.
[11:20.10]There it is.
[11:23.08]Yeah, I like how I don't even use the actual side... Wait, I thought you said don't jump down.
[11:26.80]Yeah, I'm not even using the actual iron, like, there's like a scope.
[11:33.61]Whoa.
[11:33.79]The zoom is just like super FOV.
[11:49.31]It really is.
[11:49.88]There's no scope.
[11:51.50]I'm just leaning further into the screen.
[11:56.66]Shit!
[11:57.02]Alright, this game has potential to be great.
[12:02.92]Okay, tap G to just press G.
[12:19.06]Don't worry Dad, I got it!
[12:19.90]Alright, that was the tutorial we know and we know how to play.
[12:34.82]Karate.
[12:36.46]Oh no, Dad's gonna die from a bear!
[12:40.98]This is where we're supposed to feel for the main character, because on a hunting trip, his dad dies.
[12:47.03]Oh shit, get the rifle!
[12:54.63]Alright, use... Wait, he just like... What is this, like a fucking Warcraft boss raid?
[13:03.60]He just dashes forward?
[13:04.90]That's all he does?
[13:08.10]Okay, well, you obviously aren't gonna kill him.
[13:12.20]You just run over him a bunch of times.
[13:13.68]This is how, like, this is how bears get their food, guys.
[13:16.68]They sprint over them.
[13:17.62]Alright, I'm gonna off-tank him.
[13:25.71]Okay, switch!
[13:26.27]Switch tank!
[13:27.69]There was a boss in the latest WoW raid, or when I was playing, that did the... Or Serpa, what was his name?
[13:32.81]Ursoc.
[13:33.63]This is Ursoc.
[13:41.23]Like me shooting him in the head and completes the mission.
[13:44.43]Oh, you did it.
[13:44.77]You killed the bear and you killed Ned.
[13:46.39]Good job.
[13:52.31]Complete the mission, dude.
[13:53.62]Success.
[13:54.06]Never sock DPS check.
[13:59.80]Hey, you know who made this game?
[14:05.18]The Tony Hawk Pro Skater people.
[14:06.84]Never soft.
[14:10.87]Okay.
[14:11.13]Here comes the train.
[14:13.08]The graphics are worse than I remember.
[14:14.72]RIP Neversoft.
[14:15.22]Gun!
[14:40.45]Not to be confused with any other video game.
[14:46.91]Gun.
[14:48.01]A.K.A.
[14:49.59]In-development project title.
[14:51.81]We couldn't think of anything else.
[14:57.73]Let's push her off.
[15:04.01]And then the sequel.
[15:05.49]Shoot.
[15:14.03]The second game is called Morgun.
[15:18.85]How did they get the trademark rights for this?
[15:22.10]Like, there's got to be some copyright and trademark shit.
[15:25.46]Well, he's obviously going to double-cross me.
[15:28.52]Like, there's the obvious Ned double-cross incoming in, like, fucking ten minutes.
[15:33.34]He's a preacher.
[15:45.33]As you can see, he has, like, the pale Disney villain skin.
[15:51.07]Like, all the Disney villains have, like, that pale, hollow eyes.
[15:56.33]I'm a bad guy.
[15:57.47]I'm, like, pale and have a mustache and have red eyes.
[16:02.61]I'm so evil.
[16:06.85]Keep an eye on that guy.
[16:09.66]By the way, I stashed, like, $20 million in that safe, and I'm gonna double-cross you.
[16:14.95]You fucking wanker.
[16:22.39]I told you I'm the bad guy!
[16:24.05]And you will save the lives of everyone on this boat!
[16:33.12]They will be done!
[16:36.48]What the fuck?
[16:37.64]What?
[16:37.98]Wait, what?
[16:38.70]Wait a second.
[16:39.56]Now!
[16:46.00]Wait, what?
[16:50.76]That was like... Okay, that was terrible, but that was like fucking some comedy.
[16:55.33]And now they're like stone men.
[17:00.95]Oh shit, stone men.
[17:04.91]You got it!
[17:08.89]Wait a minute, wait.
[17:10.07]Wait a second.
[17:12.25]I don't have time to think.
[17:13.15]Don't kill Ned!
[17:14.59]He's- OH SHOT THAT GUY'S FUCKING HEAD OFF!
[17:18.19]OH MY GOD!
[17:19.09]Oh my god, this game just got so much more ridiculous.
[17:24.09]Crouch!
[17:27.66]How do I zoom in?
[17:31.54]People have just fallen.
[17:32.88]Oh, you can lean?
[17:33.66]Hold on, wait, wait a second.
[17:35.96]How do I zoom in again?
[17:37.84]Wait, this is important.
[17:41.53]Z, right?
[17:45.45]Just sneak out again, please.
[17:48.01]Show your face one more time.
[17:49.79]I know you want to.
[17:50.55]I know you're right there.
[17:52.65]Just give it to me.
[17:53.41]I know you want to give it to me.
[17:55.47]Then I'll shoot your friend.
[17:57.01]Well, just like a mole.
[17:58.18]Just like whack-a-mole.
[18:01.10]Hold on.
[18:02.46]What?
[18:02.76]Did I shoot his bandana off his head?
[18:08.80]Alright, these guys are, like, smart.
[18:09.90]I gotta move.
[18:11.27]I'm gonna drink my Estus.
[18:12.19]Alright, that was outrageous.
[18:17.39]Should I pick up his gun?
[18:22.46]Oh, shit.
[18:22.84]I gotta, like... Oh.
[18:31.60]I shot her in the neck.
[18:34.68]Anybody around that corner?
[18:35.84]I don't know.
[18:36.20]Let me peek again.
[18:41.76]Oh, this game is great.
[18:43.71]Alright, I need to destroy stuff?
[18:47.05]Get out of here.
[18:51.25]What wheel?
[18:51.71]I gotta turn a wheel.
[18:52.65]Pull all the boards, locking the wheel.
[18:54.07]What the hell are you talking about, man?
[19:00.48]No, like this thing.
[19:09.04]What is... Are we moving?
[19:15.06]Oh, I get to use a cannon too.
[19:16.58]This is perfect.
[19:19.26]Nice, strong... Oh, look at this.
[19:21.02]It's just destructible environments.
[19:25.00]Alright, use the cannon.
[19:29.43]They just explode.
[19:30.93]Oh, you're no match for me, man.
[19:33.75]You're not going to win this battle.
[19:36.92]See you later.
[19:39.78]I hit that guy directly with a cannonball.
[19:48.08]Come on, one more.
[19:49.10]Get it.
[19:50.44]Got it.
[19:53.42]It's a four FPS animated sequence.
[19:56.93]Somebody just fell off the boat.
[20:01.81]Got him.
[20:03.29]Oh, that guy's flying.
[20:06.25]Oh, this game is fantastic.
[20:09.20]What a great game.
[20:11.18]Imagine playing this game when it came out like fucking 30 years ago.
[20:18.86]I think I did it.
[20:19.46]Okay, you can't destroy your own boat, apparently.
[20:34.21]This is the first level.
[20:35.25]Yeah, what a typical Call of Duty sequence.
[20:45.45]Same guy keeps diving off of the top.
[20:52.74]I shot a corner of his head off.
[20:54.50]That guy's wearing a baseball hat.
[21:00.68]They didn't have baseball hats back like fucking 150 years ago.
[21:06.14]What, like, are you gonna root for your favorite team?
[21:12.78]I'm doing some work, though, I will say.
[21:15.57]I shot that guy in the balls.
[21:16.95]Ball shots are a thing.
[21:19.89]Whoa, wait a minute!
[21:23.33]What?
[21:23.73]Oh, I wasn't paying attention to my health.
[21:26.35]Okay.
[21:28.03]Now, let's pull out the revolver for this one.
[21:36.09]And here we go.
[21:42.78]You actually do shoot like chunks of their heads off.
[21:48.24]You take away like a piece of their skull.
[22:02.09]That's so terrible.
[22:07.27]Holy shit, that guy got annihilated.
[22:21.40]Come on, get out of my way!
[22:22.56]Alright, I made it- I made it up.
[22:28.51]Maybe not quite.
[22:30.33]Somebody just went- Okay, people- Wait, what is- What?
[22:37.95]They just blew out of these buildings.
[22:39.97]I have no idea what he just said.
[22:41.97]Okay, close to A and D, yep.
[22:43.35]Not on my watch.
[22:44.51]We did it.
[22:44.95]Well, not yet.
[23:08.26]They all have the same piece of brain that comes out when you shoot.
[23:10.84]It's great.
[23:14.14]Quick draw.
[23:15.32]That's right.
[23:16.86]I keep thinking his name says New.
[23:26.65]What is the logo on their hats?
[23:28.97]I need to know what it is.
[23:31.93]It says something.
[23:33.47]Does it say Neversoft on their hats?
[23:36.63]That would be so stupid.
[23:39.53]there's like too many of these guys it's like we're never soft okay well they they're gone I completed the mission we're done we win never soft in 1880.
[24:08.88]Son, listen close, because there ain't much time.
[24:11.44]He's going to die.
[24:12.06]Watch this.
[24:12.96]I've done my best to raise you right.
[24:15.05]Of all your life, I've been lying.
[24:16.43]Bullet right in the head.
[24:18.67]The boilers are going to blow.
[24:21.41]Quick, take this.
[24:22.87]That's a token to the Alhambra.
[24:25.05]And make sure you say to the first man you see, Valabugalus.
[24:31.38]Take this coin to any man in Braavos.
[24:34.40]And say... There's a guy going to get stabbed behind him.
[24:41.32]I'm out of bullets!
[24:43.14]Why can't I do that?
[24:43.92]I don't want to golf club people.
[24:50.82]Just go!
[24:51.42]Just jump!
[24:55.96]That happened to me a few times.
[25:20.13]There's a big boss man back there.
[25:23.25]Ah, shit!
[25:25.51]You fucking... God damn it.
[25:29.67]What the hell?
[25:30.39]They're cutting off his ears?
[25:48.63]What's going on in this game?
[25:50.41]Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys?
[25:52.07]Am I a bad guy?
[25:54.47]When do I get to ride a horse?

[27:43.39]Hold down left shift to gallop your horse.
[27:45.89]While galloping, release and hold L shift again to sprint for a short distance.
[27:50.76]Repeated sprinting can damage your horse.
[27:52.38]Slowing down will heal your horse.
[27:53.54]Okay.
[27:57.60]Alright.
[28:00.18]Holding it, you just sprint.
[28:01.40]Alright.
[28:01.98]Nice.
[28:02.28]Easy to know.
[28:04.24]Alright.

[28:46.85]Is the race now?
[28:47.59]Or is the race up here?
[28:50.08]Alright, I'm racing him.
[28:55.22]Like, I just beat him.
[28:58.42]Maybe not.
[29:01.48]Did I ever intentionally kill my horse in Red Dead?
[29:03.34]Yeah, I did.
[29:03.64]Where are we going?
[29:07.34]Let's go.
[29:15.47]Oh, God damn it.

[29:29.47]Okay, this way.
[29:36.78]I don't know.
[29:37.42]Where does he want to go?
[29:38.04]First of all, I thought he was talking about that circle.
[29:39.38]What's going on?
[29:45.73]Alright, so it's the full circle.
[29:48.85]Okay.
[29:50.31]You didn't make that very clear.
[29:58.02]It's the big circle, not like the mini circle.
[30:02.68]Fucking sticky keys.
[30:04.56]Sticky keys, I swear to God.
[30:12.04]The stupid fucking feature of this dumb operating system.
[30:30.14]We had a problem with that last time.
[30:32.88]I almost just didn't make that.
[30:38.50]I'm riding the horse too hard, apparently.
[30:40.00]Alright, well, I'll let him gain some strength.
[30:47.90]And here's the second lap.
[30:50.23]I'm gonna just let the horse gain some strength, and I'm going to just spam it, like, up here in a second.
[31:00.51]Eventually, I'll be what is what is his way?
[31:02.27]Why is he on like a broom?
[31:04.45]This guy's on a fucking like broomstick No, I I Blame sticky keys for that shit like honestly I'm holding shift.

[31:40.61]Fucking sticky keys.
[31:44.25]You completed this when you were 10?
[31:45.49]Yeah, you didn't have sticky keys!
[31:57.77]You can just disable sticky keys.
[31:59.31]Not true.
[31:59.87]I've gone into the settings and turned it off like four times.
[32:03.39]It keeps coming back.
[32:05.43]There's nothing I can do about it.
[32:06.79]I've disabled it.
[32:16.74]It keeps coming back.
[32:21.94]Where am I going?
[32:22.72]What's going on here?
[32:32.05]Windows 10 doesn't have sticky keys.
[32:34.19]Well, it does because I have Windows 10.
[32:43.67]Old man doesn't know how to use a computer.
[32:46.71]I do know how to use a computer.

[42:32.06]I need 100 bits to play.
[42:40.27]I'm looking for Jenny.
[42:42.50]We brought the coin.
[42:48.82]It was a preemptive strike.
[42:53.44]Oh dear.
[42:54.98]They found it.
[43:00.00]She shot you up with a knife.
[43:01.32]I remember Ned.
[43:05.10]He was real sweet on a girl that used to work here, Sadie.
[43:09.57]Just in case you didn't see it just in case you missed it there it is Proper puke I'm gonna have to fight this guy
[43:42.21]Oh, God.

[43:55.04]Rescue Jenny.
[43:58.06]Crouch, stand.
[43:58.98]Left shift and stand.
[43:59.98]Okay, stand.
[44:00.78]Isn't that Jenny right there?
[44:03.26]She's right there.
[44:04.22]Where you going?
[44:05.46]Where you going?
[44:06.50]Come here.
[44:06.76]Jenny!
[44:07.42]Jenny!
[44:08.90]Jenny!
[44:11.14]Where's Jenny?
[44:11.94]Why are you running away?
[44:12.76]Hey!
[44:16.37]Where are you going?
[44:17.81]What?
[44:20.61]Okay, I guess that's not her.
[44:29.69]Who's this last guy?
[44:30.47]That's not Jenny.
[44:37.69]Oh, Jenny!
[44:39.05]Jenny!
[44:44.12]I think I accidentally may have killed that person.
[44:50.52]Jenny!
[45:00.85]That was a delayed reaction.
[45:07.20]That head explo- I'll never get used to the head explosion.
[45:13.25]What the fuck was that?
[45:14.91]That guy just wanted to come take a look.
[45:24.03]Who's next?
[45:32.50]Was that a- I don't think that was a bad guy.
[45:40.97]Get out of the fucking way.
[45:43.63]Jenny!
[45:46.39]Innocent person.
[45:48.33]They gave me, like, a peephole to see, like, where this bad guy was, and I... Jenny!
[46:00.48]Are you...
[46:11.07]I'm not doing that shit.
[46:12.31]I'm done like grabbing random people.
[46:14.99]I'll grab this guy.
[46:17.28]No, I won't grab that guy actually.
[46:27.05]Who's left?
[46:27.49]One more guy?
[46:37.39]This game's pretty fun for a game that came out back when the American Revolution happened.
[46:42.90]Yeah, I gotta save Jenny.
[46:46.68]Jesus!
[46:48.38]He's like, why are you sliding around?
[46:49.60]Oh god, I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go!
[46:50.80]Gotta do it now!
[46:51.24]Gotta do it now!
[46:52.64]Got him.
[46:52.84]$15.19 is worth $400 now.
[47:06.78]Night before she left, Sadie begged me to keep it safe until next year.
[47:10.86]Poor girl is in love with him, I think.
[47:13.81]What is that, like, fucking picture?
[47:16.87]That, like, fucking... That's a really unbecoming picture of somebody.
[47:20.07]Yeah, I've held onto this picture of your father looking like a psycho.
[47:24.97]Like, snarling into the camera.
[47:27.13]No.
[47:42.18]I'm telling you, you don't get more than one second.
[47:47.09]You don't get more than one second in this game before something horrible starts happening.
[47:50.27]Okay, I got a Schofield.
[47:51.35]My favorite gun.
[47:52.29]My favorite gun.
[47:54.31]Ned's old Schofield has break-apart action, which allows for faster reloads.
[47:58.38]It also has good close-range stopping power.
[48:00.22]Equip it!
[48:00.60]He's got his gang downstairs, trying to set fire to the place.
[48:05.77]Okay.
[48:07.77]Well, by trying to set fire, do you mean like lighting one doorway on fire accidentally?
[48:11.84]Because that's all he did.
[48:15.48]Easy.
[48:16.76]Fucking headshot.
[48:23.16]No, wait.
[48:24.83]Turn it off.
[48:27.01]Don't do that.
[48:29.43]Don't you know?
[48:29.95]You're not supposed to bring fucking flammable liquids.
[48:32.11]Yeah.
[48:34.41]What's the guy's goal?
[48:36.39]What is your goal?
[48:39.82]These guys with torches.
[48:41.52]Take out the torch carriers?
[48:47.89]Oh, they're starting the fire.
[48:49.53]I get it.
[48:50.03]Alright, well.
[48:53.81]It's that easy.
[49:01.11]Bang.
[49:02.95]Combo.
[49:03.87]We got another guy.
[49:04.77]One, two.
[49:05.45]I saw the guy's eyeball out.
[49:06.57]Holy Jesus.
[49:15.02]What the fuck?
[49:18.78]What happened?
[49:19.18]Why do I have explosive bullets?
[49:24.32]Where are you going?
[49:32.80]Why would you light the fire and still be inside the building?
[49:37.02]I don't get that.
[49:41.32]Doesn't that seem like a dumb move?
[49:42.54]I thought I was gonna blow up.
[49:49.13]No, I did it.
[49:49.93]The inside is safe.
[49:53.27]It's full of smoke.
[49:55.29]What?
[49:56.03]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[49:58.63]Go upstairs, stop the arsonists outside.
[50:00.35]What do you want me to do?
[50:01.21]There's like five objectives.
[50:03.39]What is happening?
[50:05.27]Stop the arsonists outside.
[50:06.35]Go upstairs and help Jenny.
[50:07.74]Stop everybody.
[50:11.20]No quick, what is?
[50:12.54]Oh shit.
[50:28.03]Jesus.
[50:30.33]Where the fuck is this guy?
[50:31.27]Alright, we're good.
[50:40.88]Crude and rude.
[50:42.08]Yeah.
[50:44.38]Alright, is that guy like a boss?
[50:53.09]Because he's sure moving around like one.
[50:59.54]Why does he get flaked?
[51:00.80]Alright, this is like taking me a little longer.
[51:03.43]I'm sorry.
[51:04.21]But this is... Okay, Jenny's like dying.
[51:05.87]I gotta get back over.
[51:06.87]Don't let her fucking die.
[51:19.92]Get a horse and run him down.
[51:24.30]Jenny, please don't die.
[51:26.98]If Jenny dies, I'm gonna be so mad.
[51:34.09]Alright, we win, right?
[51:34.99]That's it.
[51:35.57]Come on, Jenny.
[51:36.01]Get out of the house.
[51:38.85]Oh, shit.
[51:48.29]No!
[51:48.63]That's a triple!
[51:51.48]And that's a triple kill.
[51:53.10]Those three guys throw that shit?
[51:55.86]Game over.
[51:59.14]I'll take a three-piece right there.
[52:06.82]I will take that one.
[52:10.42]Uh-oh.
[52:20.69]What did you just say to me?
[52:29.25]We have a dueling mechanic now.
[52:31.33]I'm getting a lot of information here.
[52:33.33]Okay, there's no dueling mechanic.
[52:54.79]Dude came after me with a fucking hatchet.
[52:57.31]I shot him in the head three times, five times, something like that.
[53:00.43]I don't even know.
[53:01.61]I lost track.
[53:02.37]His fucking head exploded.
[53:15.30]Nice aim.
[53:16.08]I shot him in the head like five fucking times.
[53:20.25]Ooh, new weapon.
[53:21.89]Shotgun model 1887.
[53:23.84]Rude Winchester 1887 single barrel shotgun.
[53:26.52]It's slow to reload, but great for ripping enemies to shreds in close quarters combat.
[53:35.66]The people just keep appearing out of the rafters. 1887.
[53:46.28]Oh, bits.
[53:46.75]Thanks for the reminder.
[53:49.59]I've lost track.
[53:50.29]Thank you, Train, for the bits.

[56:50.91]Extra health slot.
[56:51.85]One more gulp from your flask.
[56:53.01]That's cool.
[56:54.39]Shotgun speed loader.
[56:57.86]Cylinder boring kit.
[57:02.34]I mean, it's pretty boring.
[57:05.73]Let's see.

[57:08.63]That's all I can do, right?
[57:10.25]Pistol speed loader.
[57:11.49]Pickaxe for gold.

[57:32.92]We'll go with this one.
[57:36.93]Alright.
[57:41.43]How do I... I can scalp people, apparently.
[57:47.35]Interestingly enough.
[57:48.51]Alrighty.
[57:51.01]Yeah.
[57:51.39]Oh, God is right.
[57:54.44]How do I scalp?
[57:55.50]Is this the joke stream?
[57:58.04]Not necessarily.
[58:05.94]Well, if you want the work, come see me.
[58:09.04]I'm around.
[58:11.54]You might also try my brother Daryl in Empire.
[58:14.12]Is there multiple towns in this game?
[58:15.62]Okay.
[58:16.16]Talk to Earl to begin Pony Express.
[58:19.02]I guess it's like a mission or something.
[58:20.34]I could talk to Pat Denton.
[58:22.68]Save the game.
[58:24.54]Gun save.
[58:25.22]Overwrite it.
[58:25.76]Yes.
[58:26.42]Yes.
[58:27.06]Okay.
[58:29.34]Actually, saddlebag.
[58:31.12]Weapons.
[58:32.84]So, let's see.

[58:34.81]Okay.
[58:36.53]Bowie knife.
[58:37.59]Okay, that's just equipped.
[58:39.59]I don't... Where's my other stuff?
[58:41.87]Throne, bows, sharpshooter, shotguns.
[58:45.57]The shotgun is equipped.
[58:47.67]Rifle is equipped.
[58:49.82]How do I equip... How do I pull out the shotgun though?
[58:52.98]Because like this is not... It's the same... It's the same two, right?
[58:58.41]Left click.
[58:59.59]Rifle is shot... T is... Okay, that's really odd to pull that out.
[59:03.71]That's an interesting weapon combination.
[59:05.89]I want the shotgun, though.
[59:06.87]Let's just do the main mission.
[59:09.87]Let's go pat Denton.
[59:10.85]What do you got?
[59:12.33]Oh, God.
[59:23.22]Oh, boy.
[59:23.38]Oh, God.
[59:23.58]Yeah.
[59:23.68]Somebody destroyed this bridge.
[59:24.40]Secure the bridge with a shotgun.
[59:25.68]That's not gonna work.
[59:26.72]Uh, I need the rifle.
[59:54.49]I guess you want me down here.
[60:01.79]What?
[60:03.97]What the fuck?
[60:07.34]I can't shoot the gun.
[60:14.12]What happened to me shooting the gun?
[60:15.92]No, I want the rifle.
[60:19.12]Dude, I want the rifle on.
[60:20.54]There we go.
[60:21.02]Thank you.
[60:27.88]Okay, that's what you just... You just have to grab them.
[60:35.35]Am I on fire?
[60:39.97]Why am I smoking?
[60:41.76]I have like a weapon enchant on.
[60:44.26]Interesting.
[60:49.02]Can't pick up his axe or anything?
[60:52.64]Oh, no.
[60:54.70]T... Oh, God.
[60:57.69]Jesus!
[60:59.16]What the fu- What the fuck?
[61:23.32]Okay.
[61:24.48]We're good.
[61:25.16]We're okay.
[61:26.98]Oh my god.
[61:29.82]This thing is so powerful.
[61:32.06]No, I can't.
[61:32.94]It's so hard.
[61:33.70]That's terrible.
[61:44.71]That was a triple kill.
[61:49.59]T and F.
[61:53.41]I love how they just go... We gotta throw some fucking grenades.
[62:05.38]What?
[62:08.64]You can do better than that.
[62:09.78]Like, get it over there.
[62:12.17]Is that guy on fire?
[62:14.57]There's just fucking burning arrows everywhere.
[62:17.17]Oh, for the love of God, just forget it.
[62:19.23]Oh!
[62:21.49]Oh!
[62:28.21]Don't taunt me.
[62:29.47]That's not a good idea.
[62:31.73]Don't fall off the edge either, dude.
[62:40.27]Apparently I can't do it anymore.
[62:43.59]I think I've secured the bridge.
[62:46.47]If I would take a wild guess, I would say I secured it.
[62:49.56]I did a good job.
[62:54.38]I did a good job, I think.
[62:56.10]I did a good job.
[63:00.01]I don't have any more left.
[63:00.77]That is so brutal.
[63:10.59]Jesus.
[63:11.09]What?
[63:15.23]No, these guys have extra health.
[63:20.68]It's just the spikes from... What was that game that we played?
[63:24.10]When you shoot them into the spikes?
[63:25.34]Alright.
[63:27.28]She's sending the carriage over.
[63:28.28]I need more health.
[63:31.34]Shotgun ammo?
[63:31.94]What was that?
[63:32.72]Whiskey bomb?
[63:35.92]That should be it, right?
[63:37.82]Use it to... Wait, wait, wait.
[63:39.34]Oh, oh, oh, hold on.
[63:42.40]Get on this.
[63:49.36]I thought that was going to kill me, and I was about to be very upset about it.
[63:53.12]Move the transport.
[63:57.51]Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.
[63:58.77]How did I forget the name of the game we played?
[64:06.98]I have to actually equip the knife.
[64:08.81]They're rolling over TNT in here.
[64:12.79]What happened?
[64:15.92]Wait.
[64:22.05]Wait.
[64:24.37]What is going on again?
[64:25.41]I went into outer space.
[64:30.72]Oh, thank God the checkpoint is right here So I do not want to destroy the TNT that's that's what we do not want that Okay, who is throwing these up here?
[64:50.95]You're not going to light the TNT, are you?
[64:52.79]He is.
[64:53.33]Like, what are you thinking?
[64:55.47]What the fuck are you doing?
[64:57.11]Like, why would you even do something like that?
[65:00.31]Do you know that what's gonna happen?
[65:03.36]You're aware that it's gonna blow up, right?
[65:05.56]I just want to make sure that they were aware of that.
[65:09.96]Like, are you fucking kidding me?
[65:15.34]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[65:18.43]Get me off!
[65:19.45]Get me off the boat!
[65:23.59]Okay, we're good.
[65:25.19]Throw the TNT into the river.
[65:29.15]Guys, the game just got that much better.
[65:32.02]You can throw shit in this game.
[65:36.32]Oh, shit.
[65:37.78]No, no, no, no.
[65:38.82]No, no, no.
[65:39.18]Don't...
[66:00.43]Nice throw.
[66:01.09]Well, dude, the guy comes in with a torch and I shoot him and the torch drops.
[66:03.99]Like, what am I supposed to do about that shit?
[66:06.95]No, wait a minute.
[66:07.49]I got the wrong gun out.
[66:08.29]Got the wrong gun.
[66:08.81]Don't jump.
[66:09.49]Put on... No, wait a minute.
[66:10.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[66:13.01]It's gonna blow up anyways.

[66:15.46]God damn it.
[66:19.42]I had the wrong gun out.
[66:21.34]Oh.
[66:22.42]Hold on a second.
[66:23.72]Get the right gun out.
[66:27.78]Pull it out and get ready to shoot.
[66:29.78]But you have to shoot them immediately.
[66:35.54]My god.
[66:37.58]Like right now.
[66:38.34]This guy has to die now.
[66:40.27]So does his friend.
[66:41.67]Okay, we're good.
[66:42.43]Get this shit off now.
[66:43.31]Get it off.
[66:49.53]Fuck you.
[66:52.03]Another guy come up.
[66:52.95]Yep, get rid of him.
[66:56.56]Okay, we're good.
[67:01.20]Okay.
[67:02.30]We did it.
[67:12.16]Can I pick this shit up?
[67:25.27]God damn it, I'm trying to fucking shoot it in the air.
[67:29.52]There's like 10 fucking enemies over there.
[67:34.93]Fuck.
[67:36.03]What?
[67:38.37]No, it has not.
[67:39.35]I didn't... Oh, man.
[67:50.36]That was not even close to the bridge.
[67:54.50]That was so far away from the bridge.
[67:56.10]And now we have to do the whole thing again.
[68:01.02]And that was a pretty cool air shot, by the way.
[68:02.84]That was a good job.
[68:04.50]Don't accidentally... Okay, here we go.
[68:06.24]Bro.
[68:14.54]Wait for this guy.
[68:16.20]One more guy, right?
[68:16.92]Nope.
[68:19.90]What?
[68:21.20]What?
[68:23.55]Keep it away.
[68:24.39]Keep it away from the fucking explosives.
[68:29.70]Leave it away.
[68:30.99]Please.
[68:35.83]Keep it away from the bomb.
[68:37.49]Keep away from the bomb.
[68:38.67]Get away from the bomb.
[68:39.71]Get away.
[68:40.11]I win.
[68:45.47]F is right next to V, guys, if you're curious.
[68:48.57]V and F. I pressed F to pick up the thing and pressed V. Okay, inform Pat Denton that the bridge is secure.
[68:56.37]So I gotta go back up across the whole thing.
[69:09.68]This weapon is so bad.
[69:11.55]What a bad weapon.
[69:14.61]Get off.
[69:15.15]I can't get off this thing.
[69:19.71]How do I get this burn off?
[69:22.63]How do I get the burn off my body?
[69:30.62]They're just chasing after me.
[69:32.26]I gotta get up here quick before they make it.
[69:34.62]Can I do anything?
[69:35.14]Can I throw something down here like Donkey Kong style?
[69:39.20]Okay, Pat.
[69:40.32]Uh, the bridge is secure.
[69:41.26]Alright, Pat.
[69:43.86]You and me.
[69:44.28]Out of Estus.
[69:48.45]Scalp, Pat.
[69:48.89]There's a part two to this.
[70:10.46]Hold Alt to select a weapon.
[70:11.34]While holding Alt, press G to switch to the rifle.
[70:13.35]Oh my lord.
[70:20.11]There's so many people here.
[70:21.47]This is just bad all around.
[70:22.37]This is just bad all around.
[70:23.89]Are they dead?
[70:40.33]He's gonna shoot him.
[70:44.30]Okay, they're dead.
[70:44.86]Good.
[70:45.12]Alright, let's go.
[70:45.62]Do they fight back?
[70:58.97]Oh my lord.
[70:59.71]I don't even know what's happening right now.
[71:01.35]This guy's getting littered with arrows.
[71:06.00]Like, this guy's not gonna make it, but apparently he is.
[71:07.92]Oh, we got another guy over here that's getting full of arrows.
[71:20.45]Like, that guy had an arrow in his head.
[71:24.19]I love how all I have to worry about is Pat's health.
[71:27.07]Not the health of the workers that are on fire and have arrows in their head.
[71:31.17]No, don't worry about that.
[71:35.79]I think I picked up the bow.
[71:49.85]Alright, got him.
[71:50.33]He's gonna stay up here.
[71:54.67]I'm gonna pull out the shotgun too.
[71:59.99]Shotgun's way better.
[72:04.56]Talking is to guarantee just instant kills no matter what.
[72:11.49]Wait, is there... There's a guy that's over here.
[72:16.53]Wait, what do you mean three workers are alive?
[72:20.19]What is happening right now?
[72:21.62]Where are they coming?
[72:22.16]Oh, they're down there.
[72:23.16]Shit.
[72:23.98]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[72:26.50]Oh, man.
[72:28.48]Oh, man.
[72:38.67]What?
[72:41.26]What happened?
[72:44.48]I went through the... There you go.
[73:01.53]Oh, and now we gotta do the whole entire fucking thing again.
[73:04.29]Doesn't that sound like fun everybody?
[73:13.63]Pull out the rifle.
[73:14.41]And I gotta be wary of this.
[73:15.85]They're not in range yet.
[73:21.56]Just wait.
[73:22.06]Okay.
[73:28.74]And then just... I'm gonna stay right here.
[73:30.24]Okay, reload.
[73:40.03]Did I go through the ground or did I...
[73:46.89]Okay, well the workers actually are dying, so I do need to be careful of that.
[73:50.24]Alright, here they come again.
[74:01.76]They're going up the... Ah, that was a nice shot.
[74:04.20]I'll take that one.
[74:04.80]One more.
[74:15.83]Alright.
[74:16.63]We're doing good so far.
[74:22.11]Coming up the side.
[74:22.77]Yep.
[74:23.19]The right side.
[74:25.47]Can't shoot them yet.
[74:27.05]They can't be shot yet.
[74:28.39]Okay.
[74:28.73]Now they can.
[74:29.71]Oh god damn it.
[74:37.24]Now they're coming up this side.
[74:38.82]Both there yet?
[74:39.42]Not yet.
[74:40.02]Still got time.
[74:45.41]Right over here.
[74:45.85]Gun's empty.
[74:50.37]Gun is empty.
[74:55.59]And I can't hit anybody.
[75:00.20]I've littered that guy with bullets and he's still alive.
[75:06.52]What?
[75:09.16]What in the name of God?
[75:10.66]That guy took too many hits.
[75:13.32]That's the boss.
[75:20.40]Okay.
[75:21.00]We did it.
[75:29.05]Realistic bullet drop.
[75:36.65]Thank you, wild bugs.
[75:39.09]For the bits.
[75:39.58]Stop destroying the bridge.
[75:40.62]I'm trying not to.
[75:45.21]What the?
[75:46.11]Okay.
[75:46.49]Scalp somebody, please.
[75:47.47]Yeah, I will take care of this.
[75:48.78]Why would I use quick draw when I can just do this?
[76:15.59]Quick draw.
[76:18.77]Oh, I gotta protect the TNT.
[76:20.47]We have to protect the TNT.
[76:22.99]Oh boy.
[76:23.53]Oh boy.
[76:24.99]I thought we were gonna blow the bridge.
[76:27.52]But that is not what happened.
[76:30.40]That is not the case.
[76:35.46]Okay.
[76:40.53]Please do not hit the TNT.
[76:41.99]Okay.
[76:50.49]How much longer do I have to do this for?
[76:59.29]Reading is good.
[77:00.15]It is.
[77:00.52]You're right.
[77:02.48]Do I need to go over there?
[77:04.02]No, I guess not.
[77:11.64]Reload.
[77:14.50]Anymore?
[77:17.68]What an insane shot.
[77:27.00]Kill quick killer.
[77:30.15]Quick killer.
[77:38.14]Okay, this guy has a thousand health.
[77:42.22]I want to pick up the other gun.
[77:45.70]Shotgun, please.
[77:54.71]He just chases you around.
[77:56.13]That's fine.
[77:57.77]Do I have any more?
[77:58.29]I don't think I have any more bullets for this.
[78:03.81]Nope.
[78:04.21]I don't have any more bullets.
[78:08.67]Oh, fine.
[78:09.23]Just fucking die.
[78:14.21]I'm not gonna... I didn't shoot the TNT, everybody.
[78:22.77]Calm down.
[78:24.49]I didn't shoot the TNT.
[78:28.27]Y'all thought Quickkiller's tomahawk.
[78:30.01]Quickkiller has a good range.
[78:31.02]It does a lot of damage.
[78:32.16]Oh, God.
[78:33.14]I get a throwable weapon.
[78:36.42]My immersion's broken.
[78:37.34]I blew his head up.
[78:39.38]I scalped him.
[78:40.14]Thanks to you, this bridge will be open lickety-split, and you and Jenny can be on your way.
[78:45.19]His neck turned into an anus.
[78:46.44]Are they taking his body?
[78:48.34]Where are they taking him?
[78:49.32]Okay.
[78:49.44]Talk to Jenny.
[78:50.20]How do I use the... Let's see.
[78:51.34]Saddle bag.
[78:51.70]Weapons.
[78:52.44]Throne.
[78:52.66]Throne.
[79:15.44]Damn it.
[79:16.30]Oh, here it is.
[79:18.02]So it's just my right click now, right?
[79:19.34]Yeah, it is.
[79:23.72]I guess it doesn't really change.
[79:24.64]Alright, let's go.
[79:29.24]I wish I could throw it.
[79:30.64]Alright, Pony Express, Pat Denton, Jenny, Shopkeeper.
[79:36.07]Let's go.
[79:40.21]You remember this game being way more high-res on the PlayStation 2?
[79:48.36]Well, you know, it is true.
[79:53.25]The PlayStation 2 on an old CRTV did look pretty good.
[80:02.53]Remember, this is at, like, a higher resolution than, like, the PlayStation 2 even could handle.
[80:07.51]What was the PlayStation 2?
[80:08.35]Uh, 760, 7, uh, 480 by 720?
[80:12.12]Was 720 by 480?
[80:14.14]I believe that's what it was.
[80:15.02]Either that or it was, I'm pretty sure it was 480p, right?
[80:19.79]What am I doing here?
[80:25.86]What am I doing?
[80:44.33]Oh, Jesus!
[80:50.47]It just fucking crushes them.
[80:51.89]Okay.
[81:01.49]Turn off distance clipping.
[81:07.66]Oh, man!
[81:08.40]That looks way better.
[81:10.44]Oh, that looks a thousand times better.
[81:14.52]That's so much cooler.
[81:16.77]Okay.
[81:18.01]So, uh...
[81:22.77]What was I doing here?
[81:23.69]He just fucking killed a guy.
[81:33.01]I didn't even do that.
[81:34.03]I did not kill that guy.
[81:36.31]They did that.
[81:39.73]Oh, now I'm stuck inside the fucking wagon.
[81:41.71]No, I'm good.
[81:42.85]Actually, can I do that?
[81:45.19]Can I, like, get in here?
[81:46.04]Alright, there we go.
[81:48.68]We're three horses strong now.
[81:52.78]What?
[81:57.60]It's easy.
[81:59.07]It's not hard.
[82:01.33]It's not hard at all.
[82:02.43]I just have an arrow in my skull.
[82:07.33]Give me the free ride.
[82:08.30]Alright, I gotta wrap around here.
[82:22.69]Get me back on my horse.
[82:23.65]Get on the horse.
[82:24.17]I have a new horse now.
[82:25.61]This one was free.
[82:27.03]This one was free.
[82:31.00]That ain't gonna help you.
[82:37.96]Alright, let's move.
[82:41.12]RIP horse.
[82:48.38]I just had to fucking find a way.
[82:49.92]Clear the wreckage!
[82:51.94]Blow the barricade up.
[82:53.18]TNT barrels.
[82:53.84]Behind the... Okay.
[82:54.54]TNT barrels.
[82:57.16]You got it.
[82:59.11]What?
[83:00.71]What are you talking about?
[83:01.81]Where?
[83:03.79]How do I climb this?
[83:04.45]Do I have to go around?
[83:11.13]So, alright.
[83:13.20]Where do I go from here?
[83:15.24]There's TNT on the other side.
[83:16.36]How do I get through this?
[83:20.20]My mount's too big.
[83:20.88]What are you talking about?
[83:24.99]What does this thing want me to do?
[83:27.25]Am I blind right now?
[83:32.75]Is it up?
[83:35.61]Get one of them powder kegs on the other side of this rig.
[83:48.98]What?
[83:50.42]Some TNT will do the trick.
[83:53.60]Where is this?
[84:03.32]Right there!
[84:03.98]What the?
[84:04.74]Give me a break.
[84:07.30]What?
[84:12.46]Wait, what happened?
[84:14.04]I didn't do it?
[84:14.61]Hmm.
[84:19.25]Some TNT will do the trick.
[84:28.33]Oh, shit.
[84:34.34]That little tiny opening, everything looked the same in my brain.
[84:38.34]And now I shot the TNT.
[84:39.88]I'll get it, I'll get it.
[84:40.54]Everybody calm down.
[84:48.03]I'm just gonna go grab the TNT and then shoot it.
[84:55.71]His large brain is like come on man.
[84:57.73]It's a PlayStation 2 game.
[84:58.97]It's not it's not easy to see all this shit Do you have to see?
[85:10.60]Go get some of that TNT on the other side.
[85:13.84]Go get some of that TNT Alright fine you want me to scalp somebody?
[85:19.81]Fine.
[85:24.04]That guy doesn't have a head.
[85:25.00]What about this guy?
[85:28.84]Here you go.
[85:36.03]Okay, that was terrible.
[85:37.27]Alright, that was really, really bad.
[85:39.75]What does that even do?
[85:40.83]Alright, let's go back to the barricade.
[85:48.62]Weapon crate.
[85:49.18]I don't even know what that is and I just knocked it off.
[85:52.76]That was brutal.
[85:54.22]You guys wanted to see it.
[86:01.30]And that's how you fucking do it as a streamer, okay?
[86:11.49]Easy with this.
[86:12.33]This TNT stuff.
[86:15.43]Do it again.
[86:15.83]I blinked it.
[86:16.43]I missed it.
[86:16.89]Alright, what's up here?
[86:20.54]A bridge?
[86:23.29]You got it.
[86:38.46]I love that so much.
[86:41.71]You just gotta get close.
[86:42.57]Don't even need to slide.
[86:47.79]Wait, what?
[86:50.01]I guess we're good.
[86:51.39]I guess we're moving.
[87:01.51]You just like, launch him forward.
[87:03.37]It's so perfect.
[87:04.87]It's just soccer.
[87:10.80]How many more?
[87:11.32]One more?
[87:11.78]Well, that's a good guy.
[87:14.30]It's alright.
[87:21.53]Keep moving.
[87:22.15]This horse is almost dead, by the way.
[87:23.55]I'm riding my horse too hard.
[87:35.90]How much money do I get for this?
[87:36.74]This is a long mission.
[87:37.84]Watch out for that TNT.
[87:41.10]What happened, did I lose?
[87:42.28]Okay, thank God.
[87:45.60]He's gonna hit the TNT.
[87:53.39]Why do I feel like this is not a cutscene, this is just something in the game happening?
[88:04.11]The wheel pin's busted!
[88:07.37]Now here comes a horde mode.
[88:08.35]Nice.
[88:13.78]Nice.
[88:15.54]Character switch.
[88:16.78]Protect the damage coach.
[88:17.92]Yeah.
[88:19.62]I knew this was going to happen.
[88:23.50]Ammo full.
[88:24.10]Okay, I need to like duck.
[88:34.52]Shot the weapon out of his hand.
[88:35.78]Wow.
[88:36.38]Double weapon shot.
[88:37.88]And then right in the face.
[88:38.62]Yeah, the coach is under attack.
[88:46.97]Don't worry.
[88:47.89]Wait, people come from behind now too.
[88:52.56]Get out of the way.
[88:56.04]This lady is just pushing me away.
[89:02.28]Why are you not getting cover, Jenny?
[89:05.88]Jenny is full of arrows.
[89:07.64]Alright, Jenny.
[89:10.16]You're really making this hard for me.
[89:12.72]If I'm gonna not lie here.
[89:19.95]Bring out the pistol.
[89:26.57]Come on.
[89:27.05]From that far away and I couldn't even hit the damn fucking TNT.
[89:36.97]Die, dude.
[89:39.73]Give me the horse.
[89:42.35]God damn it.
[89:47.40]I want that horse.
[89:48.22]I need to run around in circles.
[89:55.10]Pull it around.
[89:56.28]Reload.
[89:56.74]I'm going to grab around here.
[89:57.51]I'm going to get everybody.
[90:00.51]Watch this one.
[90:02.39]Don't expect this shit, do you?
[90:09.01]Taken care of.
[90:09.49]That could have been bad, actually.
[90:20.99]Jenny's almost dead.
[90:21.79]Can I heal Jenny?
[90:33.33]Dead?
[90:33.79]Yeah.
[90:41.04]Will you fucking die?
[90:44.86]What the fuck?
[90:48.30]Oh my god.
[90:53.20]Thank you Wild Bugs for the bits.
[90:55.06]Advanced streamer.
[90:59.56]Thank you Styx for the $3.42.
[91:03.76]If I might suggest a game for a future stream, Jackie Chan's Stuntmaster.
[91:07.69]I don't know, I've... No.
[91:12.46]I've seen that game be played.
[91:17.36]I'm standing on top.
[91:21.24]This does not sound like the best idea.
[91:23.11]I don't think I can fall off this though, that's a good thing.
[91:29.51]No, I can't fall off.
[91:31.21]It's not possible.
[91:39.49]I was about to be very sad if I could fall.
[91:52.75]Watch out for the horse!
[92:01.83]Anybody else?
[92:03.05]Nope!
[92:05.58]Yeah, I mean, we're just sharpshooting, guys.
[92:08.88]Nobody on that horse.
[92:17.76]Anybody else?
[92:18.16]No!
[92:21.94]These poor horses.
[92:22.80]No, this really is a Red Dead mission.
[92:27.68]I guess that guy didn't get run over somehow.
[92:36.41]One more.
[92:37.13]Got him.
[92:39.49]Defend the coach.
[92:47.64]Can I get it?
[92:51.30]Got it.
[92:54.24]No, didn't get it.
[92:55.01]That weapon is so bad.
[92:59.89]There's nothing good about that weapon, it seems.
[93:10.54]Ow.
[93:11.48]Oh, boy.
[93:12.06]Hold on.
[93:14.16]The stagecoach is gonna die.
[93:15.26]Alright, got some brain matter on that guy.
[93:19.08]We're good.
[93:22.72]Disintegrated.
[93:27.67]Now it's just a rail shooter.
[93:29.11]Unfortunately, it is.
[93:32.83]But we made it.
[93:35.17]What are you giving me?
[93:38.73]Full bottle.
[93:44.30]Can't afford any more damage on this thing.
[93:51.54]But it's gonna take it anyways.
[93:58.73]No, what a dumb idea that would be.
[93:59.91]The music's gone.
[94:03.35]This is very eerie where everything's silent.
[94:07.79]Is it TNT back there?
[94:20.88]Oh, there's TNT here.
[94:26.21]Well, that's, I guess...
[94:31.76]How many more of these guys are there?
[94:33.26]I want to get to the next town.
[94:35.44]Let's go.
[94:35.88]I'm out of ammo.
[94:38.02]Do I have any ammo in my revolver?
[94:40.97]Yeah, I think you can fit an ammo in the revolver.
[94:47.63]Okay.
[94:55.20]Why would you ever ride around with TNT in your car?
[94:59.76]I have an idea, guys.
[95:02.34]Let's ride our cart with a bunch of explosive dynamite inside of it.
[95:07.82]Hopefully nothing happens to us.
[95:13.31]A new federal marshal, bounty, ranch, and hunting missions are now available.
[95:21.87]Oh, a little horse whinny.
[95:27.03]We got another obvious bad guy or what?
[95:30.51]Thank God you're here.
[95:32.98]damn apaches cut the telegraph wires and I was beginning to fear for the worst none of your precious parts was damaged I hope is this the same guy with a mustache or is this a different person I'm in one piece thanks to colton here he left more than a few apaches dead in their tracks
[95:54.78]So this is a new town.
[95:55.87]Hoodoo.
[95:56.15]Mr. Hoodoo.
[95:56.35]Uh-huh.
[96:22.67]Okay, has it been more than 10 seconds?
[96:26.13]Every cutscene is chaos.
[96:34.42]Your trek has just begun.
[96:35.24]Increase your stats.
[96:35.94]To cope with increasingly difficult enemies, you can increase your stats.
[96:39.78]Use the map to show where you are in the world and where you can locate side missions to increase your stats.
[96:45.02]Over the map by entering the pause menu and selecting map.
[96:46.87]You can also travel back to the story mission instantly.
[96:52.51]Didn't somebody just blow a building up?
[96:56.71]Okay.
[96:58.69]Let's see.
[97:02.19]So, shopkeeper, marshal, rutabar.
[97:06.73]Okay, these are like the missions.
[97:12.37]Hold on.
[97:14.65]I guess these are all like the little side missions.
[97:19.94]Fairly intricate game for being as old as it is.
[97:23.48]Is there a guy in here?
[97:25.22]I'll take it.
[97:25.56]Let's go get some money.
[97:26.24]Fifteen bucks.
[97:26.68]Let's go get this Stumpy asshole.
[97:48.99]Let's just go kick his ass.
[97:53.77]Oh no, no GPS.
[97:57.99]No GPS guys.
[98:03.00]I can't rely on that shit anymore.
[98:04.52]Let's go this way.
[98:17.32]I am screwed without a GPS.
[98:25.08]Was this gold?
[98:27.40]I can dig this, can't I?
[98:30.46]Yep.
[98:33.20]How much is it worth?
[98:33.78]10 bucks.
[98:36.87]This is easy.
[98:43.17]Just no clip.
[98:45.23]I just made 30 bucks.
[98:52.82]Oh, the game just opened up.
[98:54.02]That's perfect for us.
[98:56.68]Let's go over here.
[98:57.30]I'm going to assume just take a left out of here.
[99:07.62]And I got to get on a road.
[99:08.98]I got to get up there.
[99:12.26]Butch Maynard wanted dead or alive.
[99:14.02]Is that the guy that I'm after?
[99:16.72]I think it is, right?
[99:24.49]Over here.
[99:26.78]How has nobody found that gold before?
[99:28.40]That's a good question.
[99:35.60]I guess we're going to follow this road.
[99:40.04]Hopefully it leads us to where we want to go.
[99:41.91]Ow.
[99:50.77]Oh, no.
[99:51.39]Can you swim in this game?
[99:52.73]Is this one of those old school PlayStation games where you can't swim?
[99:59.07]It might be.
[99:59.55]I'm getting close.
[100:11.43]This game makes you want some apple cider.
[100:13.08]Why is that?
[100:29.84]Come here.
[100:31.72]Get over here.
[100:34.62]Come here.
[100:36.34]Butch.
[100:36.62]I got him.
[100:43.63]Quick draw.
[100:47.51]I just bopped him in the side of the head.
[100:51.07]Find Hoodoo at his casino.
[100:52.71]Okay.
[100:54.11]I made a lot of money.
[100:54.87]Let's go.
[100:55.61]Indian Hunter.
[100:57.77]What's this?
[101:02.15]I guess this is probably another one of those.
[101:03.35]This is probably like a hunting side mission.
[101:06.79]Great beasts roam these lands.
[101:10.68]To hunt them, you must be keen-eyed and soft of foot.
[101:14.18]Sure.
[101:14.72]A true warrior uses his bow to hunt these beasts.
[101:17.68]Ooh, a bow and arrow.
[101:18.70]Creep close and send the arrow through their eyes.
[101:22.68]This is more honorable than a bullet, for it takes great skill and courage.
[101:26.58]That's true.
[101:28.32]When you are prepared, seek me out again.
[101:31.91]Am I going to get 15 bucks?
[101:33.79]Uh... I kind of don't want to do this right now.
[101:42.20]Let's open up the map.
[101:46.40]I need to go to here.
[101:48.50]How do I travel here?
[101:49.78]Is there a way to fast travel?
[101:52.62]Did it tell me there was like a travel thing or no?
[101:56.46]I don't think there is.
[101:57.08]I need a horse.
[102:03.77]Hey, a horse!
[102:04.17]I need one of these.
[102:10.89]I wonder if the train actually moves around in this game.
[102:12.71]It'd be really interesting if it did.
[102:19.88]Just kill him?
[102:20.62]No!
[102:20.86]I'm gonna, like, need him.
[102:24.02]Select the story mission?
[102:27.16]Isn't it, like, over here?
[102:28.56]Isn't that it?
[102:29.08]Oh, no, it's side mission.
[102:30.16]Where's, like, the story mission?
[102:34.02]Oh, you actually have to press left and right on the arrow keys.
[102:38.00]Okay.
[102:39.12]Bog with Hoodoo selected.
[102:40.71]Let's go.
[102:41.45]Launch it.
[102:49.51]It's sized up.
[102:51.89]Can I just say that I'm really sad I missed playing this game as a kid?
[103:00.90]Man, it seems fairly elaborate for being as old as it is.
[103:04.77]Come on in, kid.
[103:06.25]We were just about to hold our usual confabulation before the night shift begins.
[103:11.32]I see Rudabaugh has already... Red Dead Vice City.
[103:14.42]J.J.
[103:15.08]Webb.
[103:15.70]Kind of.
[103:16.52]Now tell us about this fella you're looking for.
[103:20.24]Jenny said something about him being a jack preacher.
[103:23.26]Reed's his name.
[103:24.12]Josiah Reed.
[103:26.13]What do you want with him?
[103:27.83]Dead.
[103:28.15]Hmm.
[103:28.23]I see.
[103:31.41]This game is four years old?
[103:33.00]No, it is not.
[103:33.68]This game is like fucking 12 years old.
[103:35.66]This game came out in like 2005.
[103:36.38]Empire Police Department.
[103:56.73]Oh, it's because it's still... Nightbot still thinks it's Gunslinger.
[103:59.57]Nightbot still believes it's Gunslinger.
[104:01.57]Okay.
[104:01.97]Alright, let's go.
[104:02.61]Follow Web and Rudabot to the saloon.
[104:21.62]Oops.
[104:22.70]Sorry, guys.
[104:23.50]I have to be front.
[104:24.18]I'm the alpha male.
[104:25.26]I have to be in front of everyone.
[104:26.41]Alright, what's going on in the saloon?
[104:35.39]Who is shooting?
[104:36.03]And why is everybody over... What are you guys doing over here?
[104:38.55]Alright, here we go.
[104:42.08]We're gonna ride our horses into the saloon.
[104:46.24]Sorry.
[104:47.92]I did not mean to do that.
[104:49.06]And now he's like a bad guy.
[104:51.51]Is he?
[104:51.69]Get the fuck out of here.
[105:05.70]I cheated?
[105:06.14]Wait, I cheated in the cards?
[105:08.04]What are you talking about?
[105:08.68]I didn't even play cards yet.
[105:10.02]Where's Chavez?
[105:11.72]He just left.
[105:13.30]Before that, he was talking to them two.
[105:15.98]Well, I don't know.
[105:17.13]Sorry.
[105:17.55]I guess your problem's getting pretty big.
[105:19.93]My patches don't start pulling soon.
[105:22.09]Everybody has to be so dirty.
[105:24.33]I don't know why.
[105:29.39]Wait a minute.
[105:32.68]It's automatically a policeman.
[105:34.74]I don't like him anymore.
[105:37.70]That guy had like the fucking scale.
[105:39.62]We were like, I'm not even going to make the joke because I'm going to die.
[105:42.84]There he is.
[105:46.37]Take him down.
[105:48.41]Holy shit, it's all the same guy.
[106:02.90]Okay.
[106:04.28]Dead end.
[106:08.40]Ghost cowboys.
[106:15.12]Shoot him before he goes.
[106:19.04]Why let him do that?
[106:19.79]Shoot him right in the back of the head.
[106:24.33]Gallop.
[106:24.75]Yeah.
[106:25.53]Run, run, run.
[106:28.43]He's getting too far away.
[106:29.91]Well... Oh, fuck you, Sticky Keys.
[106:39.19]Ah, I- jeez.
[106:41.26]Oh my god.
[106:42.08]There we go.
[106:52.50]Follow him to the hideout.
[106:55.01]There actually is a train.
[106:56.61]That's really perfect to know.
[107:02.58]Turn off sticky kills.
[107:03.88]I've tried.
[107:04.40]Who are here?
[107:08.04]Come on.
[107:10.70]Oh, those are bad guys.
[107:11.42]Well, the horse is dead.
[107:15.32]That means I need your horse now.
[107:17.24]Thank you.
[107:17.58]One more.
[107:25.40]Just ram him.
[107:26.30]Ram the fucking dive is the best move in the game.
[107:28.91]Why would you ever do another move?
[107:31.65]See?
[107:37.87]Did I just kill my horse?
[107:41.67]Oh my lord, what have I done?
[107:47.47]Keep going.
[107:48.97]I just tomahawked the back of my horse's head somehow.
[107:53.03]Raid the ranch.
[107:57.21]I can't make it up.
[107:59.15]I almost killed the horse too.
[108:00.19]At least the horse is dead again.
[108:17.46]One more.
[108:17.86]Two more.
[108:21.66]Give me the shotgun for this one.
[108:24.64]Shotgun's definitely way better.
[108:26.42]Just is.
[108:30.11]What's in this here?
[108:30.69]Anything?
[108:31.63]Stuff?
[108:32.35]No.
[108:32.69]Cutscene.
[108:34.17]I killed three horses in two minutes.
[108:35.37]I added.
[108:37.31]No horse counter.
[108:41.55]Put your hands in the air!
[108:43.45]Let us go!
[108:46.40]Guess we missed Chavez.
[108:48.98]He's been playing this for over... Holy shit!
[108:51.82]What the fuck?
[108:52.24]Oh, man.
[108:52.50]The deputies are corrupt.
[108:54.04]There's never a dull moment.
[109:17.10]I missed.
[109:20.76]What if he's just a really bad shot?
[109:22.78]Do I get like a choice here?
[109:29.30]You must have your weapon drawn.
[109:30.52]Hold the keyboard left or right and then double tap left shift.
[109:34.95]Hold the keyboard left and right.
[109:36.61]I can pick it up and hold it.
[109:39.77]Like I'm holding it in my hand.
[109:40.87]Like hold it to the left.
[109:42.57]Hold it to the right.
[109:43.27]God, that's a fucking A-plus joke.
[109:48.95]What do I have to do?
[109:50.17]Hold the keyboard left or right.
[109:51.75]I don't think I understood that tutorial.
[110:06.22]Hold the keyboard left or right.
[110:12.80]I'm just going to kill them because I hold the keyboard.
[110:27.88]What a waste of fucking time that was.
[110:39.21]The left or right keys on the keyboard.
[110:44.49]What?
[110:46.31]The gun has to be out.
[110:47.44]Hold left or right.
[110:48.58]I'm holding left.
[110:49.84]It doesn't seem to do anything.
[110:55.79]I did it before like randomly, accidentally somehow.
[110:58.91]Let me figure out how the fuck to do this.
[111:00.05]Alright, I'm gonna go into options because that makes abso-fucking-lutely no sense.
[111:13.65]Left shift.
[111:25.40]Oh my, that's fucking... Uh, what?
[111:43.25]Okay, it's... I have to... Okay, so here's what... It's double tap A or D while holding shift.
[111:58.24]Actually, no it's not.
[112:13.47]Th-that... Okay, it's not doing it anymore.
[112:22.08]It's not... Double tap shift while holding A or D?
[112:30.69]You need two hands to do that, by the way.
[112:33.14]Try holding A and double tapping shift.
[112:38.52]Double tap shift while holding A. Do that with your hand right now.
[112:42.84]Hold A and double tap shift.
[112:44.24]Do it.
[112:45.78]Tap shift five times.
[112:47.10]Okay, what the fuck?
[112:53.02]It's double tap shift while strafing.
[112:58.67]So are you telling me I have to use my pinky to hit shift?
[113:03.76]So it's A, double tap with my left pinky?
[113:07.76]That's fucking moronic.
[113:13.16]I'm changing this.
[113:20.43]Just press shift six times.
[113:21.81]No, I got a better fucking idea.
[113:29.28]Why can you do that so easily?
[113:30.42]It's not fair.
[113:31.03]Okay, I can do it this way.
[113:43.53]I swear to God, I was doing this before and it didn't work.
[113:50.99]Okay, you have to only be strafing.
[113:53.21]You cannot do anything else.
[113:55.03]Like, you can't hold W and D at the same time.
[114:11.50]This is so awkward.
[114:18.44]This is like the most awkward fucking thing ever.
[114:22.16]Holding A and then tapping double shift.
[114:24.93]Yeah, that's weird.
[114:25.93]Because I can see right now I'm strafing, right?
[114:35.85]It won't work now.
[114:42.81]How much health does your horse have, by the way, buddy?
[114:44.49]I'm ready to go.
[115:00.87]I'm going to fucking die.
[115:01.85]I'm trying to knock the horse down.
[115:08.33]That's not going to work, apparently.
[115:09.35]Your horse has infinite fucking health.
[115:27.73]I just spit all of my screen because of how fucking terrible the controls of this game are.
[115:31.79]That's the worst fucking thing ever.
[115:34.05]Four out of ten.
[115:39.43]You have to do like finger fucking gymnastics to do a fucking dodge roll while playing the game.
[115:46.46]This is fucking so stupid.
[115:50.06]I have to be like... It's like W, A, S, D, D, D, A, S, shift, left, correct.
[116:02.59]Give me a fucking break.
[116:03.57]He just shot the gun while he was rolling.
[116:20.66]That's not fair.
[116:21.48]I did- I definitely did not do that.
[116:35.01]I did not fucking do that.
[116:44.25]Oh my god, dude.
[116:45.11]Didn't you guys make Tony Hawk?
[116:52.74]Whatever happened to the controls there?
[116:54.08]Did the ball just ram him?
[117:06.03]Okay, that guy's dead.
[117:09.41]Get me on a horse.
[117:21.65]Come here.
[117:26.40]No, get... Pick that up.
[117:33.66]I don't think this is... I don't have any more bullets left.
[117:42.73]Get all these blocks out of my way.
[117:51.07]I'm going to spam the fuck out of him.
[117:57.01]And get him.
[118:00.73]I win.
[118:05.81]Fuck that.
[118:06.27]Fuck that move.
[118:07.31]That, like, double tap shift while holding D while aiming and shooting and then hold D and then press X and then press Z to zoom in and press fucking V. Get out of fucking town.
[118:19.92]Get out of town.
[118:23.90]This is one of those old school fucking games that was on PlayStation 2 that they ported to PC and all the controls are fucking awful.
[118:30.61]Remember what it was like to play fucking PC games ten years ago?
[118:36.38]Where they just threw up controls over the keyboard?
[118:45.53]Buy a Steam... No, the Steam controller is awful!
[118:48.47]Buy a Steam controller!
[118:49.69]No, I will send it back!
[118:51.53]That thing's awful, awful, awful.
[118:58.36]Howdy, stranger.
[119:00.18]Howdy, stranger.
[119:00.82]I hear you're looking for some extra work.
[119:04.56]Well, you're in luck.
[119:05.94]I need to get my cattle back to their pens.
[119:14.04]No, I'm not doing a cattle mission.
[119:15.24]Wow, they really did... A lot of Red Dead Redemption stuff in this game.
[119:19.78]Like cattle herding.
[119:24.45]Well, I mean, the Steam controller really is a piece of absolute shit.
[119:28.17]Are you guys really going to argue that one with me?
[119:31.78]The Steam Controller is the worst controller I have ever used.
[119:37.15]The game just crashed.
[119:39.01]And I haven't saved the game in like an hour and ten minutes.
[120:02.06]I have a Steam controller.
[120:05.54]It's not good.
[120:15.55]I wasn't talking shit about Gaunt.
[120:16.73]I was talking shit about the Steam controller.
[120:18.22]Hold on.
[120:22.04]Let's see if this works.
[120:24.68]Is there an autosave?
[120:26.94]That was at...
[120:29.47]uh fellas uh this save was an hour ago the game was like fun too and I just
[120:59.72]Well, the game was fun.
[121:02.93]I was having a good time.
