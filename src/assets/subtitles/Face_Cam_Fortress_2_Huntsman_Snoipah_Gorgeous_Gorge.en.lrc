[00:09.52]Oh my god, what just... Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:12.52]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:16.01]I'm so confused right now.
[00:17.09]What the hell just even happened right there?
[00:19.69]I just shot a spy and he like flipped backwards into a bunch of stuff and like broke all... That was as if I threw him into a table.
[00:26.77]What the hell was that?
[00:28.53]But yeah, Facecam Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[00:30.65]How you guys all doing?
[00:31.55]How you guys having a fantastic Monday?
[00:34.41]And they're gonna get that first point.
[00:36.89]No.
[00:37.99]Zeppelin, you gotta stop him.
[00:39.11]Me and Zeppelin are gonna drop a friggin' Zeppelin on their heads.
[00:44.29]Oh!
[00:45.05]No, don't disconnect, please.
[00:46.57]Please don't disconnect.
[00:48.49]Please, Zeppelin.
[00:53.56]Here we go.
[00:54.72]Headshot!
[00:55.66]Yeah!
[00:56.78]That's what I like to say.
[00:59.24]This hodja is a headshot.
[01:01.88]If I'd waited another second, I would've had him.
[01:06.18]Whoa, that was a little bit of laggy lag right there.
[01:08.76]Not too keen on that.
[01:11.29]That... I think people are just disconnecting left and right here.
[01:15.63]Hey, I'll use it to my advantage.
[01:17.89]Oh, that's three in a row!
[01:21.27]I call that a three in a row.
[01:22.89]Welcome to hell!
[01:23.83]I'm actually doing pretty... pretty well right now.
[01:28.94]Question is, can you keep it going?
[01:31.76]It's the age-old question right there.
[01:33.96]That's another headshot.
[01:36.88]Gotta get that guy.
[01:39.30]Get him off that point.
[01:40.14]Get him offa!
[01:43.20]Damn!
[01:43.80]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[01:44.86]No!
[01:45.48]No!
[01:48.12]That was a pretty good run, though.
[01:48.94]I killed, like, five or six people.
[01:51.28]I think they are going to get it, unfortunately.
[01:55.07]Unfortunately, no.
[01:56.83]Two soldiers.
[01:59.31]Oh, well.
[02:00.15]What can you do, right?
[02:02.49]So today, my drink of choice is a delicious iced tea.
[02:06.94]Not just any iced tea, it's the pure leaf stuff.
[02:10.18]If you've never had pure leaf, it is probably the best iced tea you could ever drink.
[02:14.58]And he had to move.
[02:16.50]He had to move, didn't he?
[02:18.84]You are stuck in there, my friend.
[02:21.88]Should've hit him with that.
[02:24.47]Oh, he's still alive!
[02:25.71]Oh, and there's a... No, I'm gonna eat a pretzel.
[02:32.85]I got, oh by the way, do you guys remember, speaking of stuff that I drink and eat and stuff like that, who remembers these things?
[02:40.11]Do you remember these things?
[02:41.61]The pretzels in the box?
[02:44.24]I remember, when I was like five or six years old, I used to eat these every day.
[02:48.34]Oh my god, oh my god, they're gonna win.
[02:51.08]Not if I have anything to say about it!
[02:53.38]Oh, chaos!
[02:54.53]It's just absolute chaos!
[02:56.97]Oh, I figured I could've done something about that.
[02:59.29]By the way,
[03:03.96]These are so stale, I just bit into a piece of white bread.
[03:08.74]Forget that.
[03:10.50]Let's go again, come on.
[03:12.58]I was on a roll there, and I got too busy talking about pretzels and iced tea, that I didn't do... shoot.
[03:21.91]Time to time travel.
[03:22.73]If you remember what time traveling is, it's when I go like this.
[03:27.27]And we appear at the setup.
[03:28.91]It's over.
[03:30.19]Time travel, the best kind of travel.
[03:34.09]So let's kill that guy up top.
[03:36.05]Or just totally miss him.
[03:37.06]Either one of those two things I'm happy with, for sure.
[03:40.76]Walk into it.
[03:42.38]That sniper right there is gonna have a bad day!
[03:45.06]Oh, what?
[03:47.04]I would have headshot him.
[03:52.18]Oh, things are not looking good right in the beginning here, folks.
[03:55.79]I knew it.
[03:57.19]I could see through all the way down into... Look it!
[03:59.73]My arrow is in his scope!
[04:02.79]That's ridiculous.
[04:04.43]My arrow was through his scope.
[04:06.32]Shouldn't that have hit him?
[04:07.40]Actually, no, it's through the barrel.
[04:08.92]So technically that's like an eye or like a... No, that's not.
[04:12.48]That wouldn't be an eye shot.
[04:13.58]What the H-E double honky stick am I talking about?
[04:17.32]Should have hit him.
[04:18.58]Should have hit him.
[04:19.62]Oh, I'm doing all kinds of missing here tonight right here.
[04:22.95]Not on that guy.
[04:25.83]I interpreted his movements.
[04:28.89]I need health though.
[04:29.47]Where's that medic?
[04:31.28]Medic!
[04:32.96]Medic!
[04:34.90]Medic!
[04:38.44]Medic!
[04:41.25]Medic!
[04:41.91]No!
[04:42.81]You!
[04:45.03]I'll take you on now.
[04:46.19]I'll take you on now!
[04:47.67]Let's go!
[04:48.73]Let's go, man!
[04:50.34]Oh, give me your chop-chop, spy!
[04:53.76]Oh, I just freaked out.
[04:55.78]I stole that guy's health so bad.
[04:59.74]I'll get him this time, right here.
[05:01.82]Right through the trees.
[05:03.71]Like a real sniper.
[05:09.01]Oh, yeah, there it is!
[05:09.95]There it is!
[05:12.75]Gotta be careful here.
[05:14.99]Smart.
[05:16.56]Smart Demoman, you are smart.
[05:18.04]What is your name?
[05:20.82]What is that guy's name?
[05:24.16]My god.
[05:26.28]That is not a PG name.
[05:33.82]The best part about Steam is the fact that you can just make your name something just absolutely ludicrous.
[05:40.68]And that's... Spy, what are you doing, man?
[05:44.61]Is he still alive?
[05:45.51]I don't know.
[05:46.49]I would only think you'd do that if you had a dead ringer.
[05:49.41]Crap!
[05:50.21]Oh no!
[05:52.08]At least he got it.
[05:53.38]At least one of us is not going to burn to death.
[05:57.12]Oh, give him the ol' chop chop!
[05:58.58]It's the same guy!
[05:59.34]It's the same, like, really nice guy.
[06:03.02]I love how it was that guy and chicken that killed me.
[06:11.52]Oh, this guy, like, XX, like, and chicken!
[06:15.90]Gotta love chicken.
[06:19.42]Did not mean to click, by the way.
[06:20.81]That was a misclick.
[06:23.99]Let's go!
[06:25.25]At least I killed him.
[06:26.89]At least I killed him.
[06:29.77]Oh, I gotta, like, relax a little bit here.
[06:31.49]I'm being a little too crazy.
[06:33.43]I gotta step back a little bit.
[06:35.74]Take a breather.
[06:38.72]Okay, now it's time to bring the headshots back.
[06:42.08]Time to bring it back to headshotville.
[06:45.06]And if not... And you know what?
[06:47.38]What can you do?
[06:49.13]Headshot.
[06:50.41]Nope.
[06:57.21]Where are these... That guy just came out of nowhere.
[07:01.37]Oh, this is bad.
[07:04.37]They're pushing us all the way back.
[07:06.51]This is really bad.
[07:07.53]It started off really good, too.
[07:11.05]Let's go.
[07:11.39]Me and sell on 88.
[07:16.13]Damn, this is not good.
[07:17.49]Ah.
[07:24.65]Come on now.
[07:25.65]That's a spy right there.
[07:27.90]That is not a spy.
[07:29.60]I'm so paranoid right now.
[07:37.74]Where's this other guy?
[07:38.54]No!
[07:41.84]I hit him right in the back of the head with the stupid thing.
[07:46.71]Walk into it.
[07:49.77]We got a cactus.
[07:50.45]Get on the point here, fellas.
[07:53.15]Spy?
[07:53.45]No.
[07:55.53]Keep it going here, keep it going here.
[07:58.86]Even if I die, you will remember me.
[08:06.34]Nice, nice.
[08:08.02]Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
[08:09.92]I'm so sorry, Heavy.
[08:11.99]I didn't realize he had that little health.
[08:14.81]He had, like, no health.
[08:15.81]I have to say sorry.
[08:20.83]And then sad face.
[08:22.71]Heavy, I'm sorry I took that health.
[08:26.14]We're gonna get it, though.
[08:28.12]Oh, by the way, speaking of just weird things, I have a hat on today.
[08:31.74]It is a backwards Baker Boy.
[08:34.50]I think I've had this hat on before in previous videos.
[08:37.63]The vintage Baker Boy.
[08:38.79]That's a miss.
[08:43.21]That's a miss as well.
[08:47.19]That's... Oh, man, he got me with such a crazy meat shot right there.
[08:53.16]Health so bad, I'm gonna die.
[08:59.36]Oh, get lit!
[09:01.30]Crap.
[09:03.52]I might have to change here.
[09:05.08]We might see a change.
[09:06.10]Huntsman ain't really working so well at this moment in time in history.
[09:10.78]We got the point, at least.
[09:11.71]That's a good thing.
[09:17.35]Ah!
[09:19.49]Ay-yi-yi!
[09:23.63]Get him with that Geo-Roddy!
[09:27.68]That sniper's gunning for me.
[09:31.52]Good.
[09:31.68]If I can keep that sniper preoccupied, I'm happy.
[09:35.29]Oh, man!
[09:36.17]Nice shot.
[09:37.65]Alright, it's time to change.
[09:38.41]We gotta change to... Gotta go medic.
[09:42.21]We need one so bad.
[09:43.15]Alright, let's go, fellas.
[09:46.17]Let's do a super push here.
[09:49.22]Except I don't want to get myself killed, so don't go too far away from me, or else you're not gonna get healed.
[09:53.56]No, don't go down!
[09:54.46]Actually, yeah, go down.
[09:55.12]Go down.
[09:55.96]Go down.
[09:58.68]That was a big mistake.
[09:59.86]Big mistake on my part.
[10:00.75]I should not have gone anywhere.
[10:03.43]Are we gonna cap it?
[10:04.31]Are we gonna win?
[10:05.75]Oh!
[10:07.29]Get on it!
[10:10.83]Yes!
[10:11.49]Oh, we did it!
[10:12.55]Hooray!
[10:13.80]Nice job, guys.
[10:15.54]Good game all around.
[10:16.80]And that's gonna wrap it up here for Face Game Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[10:21.66]Thank you guys so much for watching.
[10:22.80]Really do appreciate it.
[10:23.96]And I will see you guys all next time.
[10:27.03]Clink!
[10:31.04]Take care, everybody.
