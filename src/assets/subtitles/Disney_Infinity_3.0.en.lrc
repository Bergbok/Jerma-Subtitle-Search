[00:00.97]Disney Infinity 3.0.
[00:01.51]Those of you that don't know, I said to somebody, somebody said, hey, would you ever play Disney Infinity 3.0?
[00:09.17]And I said, I would rather show my asshole on stream.
[00:17.01]So, I guess I would rather do this.
[00:22.28]I have no idea what this game is.
[00:23.84]I have absolutely no clue.
[00:26.74]I just know that somebody said, dude, play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[00:31.77]And it just hard crashed.
[00:36.37]Disney Infinity 3.0 is not responding.
[00:40.57]Okay.
[00:40.77]Let's try that again.
[00:47.86]Disney Infinity 3.0 Gold Edition.
[00:54.96]Okay.
[00:56.34]This is taking over my whole computer.
[01:00.61]It's on the... Okay, I have three monitors.
[01:02.67]It's on that monitor now.
[01:04.83]Over there.
[01:06.81]Why is it on the other monitor?
[01:16.44]What?
[01:17.78]This game uses an autosave feature.
[01:19.50]Do not power off the system while this icon is shown.
[01:21.56]Streaming videos not rated by local rating boards.
[01:25.88]What?
[01:28.10]What does that mean?
[01:31.29]There are videos on here that have not been rated?
[01:32.97]Is that what it means?
[01:34.25]Or does it mean that it's... If you're watching a stream of somebody play this, like me, that's not rated.
[01:41.40]You can't see it, but I don't want it on this monitor.
[01:43.42]I'm trying to capture the game.
[02:06.96]Give me a sec.
[02:19.86]Oh my god.
[02:24.76]I can't move it.
[02:25.40]How do I move this fucking thing?
[02:28.82]Why are there no options?
[02:30.26]How do I move this?
[02:31.77]To another monitor?
[02:38.08]Shift and arrow key.
[02:39.60]Windows, shift, arrow key.
[02:47.49]That did not do anything.
[02:49.11]That ruined everything.
[02:51.63]I have... It's a mess now.
[02:53.67]It's a fucking mess.
[03:03.18]I can't move it.
[03:09.96]I'm just going to play it on the other monitor.
[03:17.57]The game's not even being captured either.
[03:22.55]So get it.
[03:28.16]So capture it!
[03:36.55]Where do you think you're going?
[03:55.35]no it's not gonna happen this game was okay they made this game for like consoles and then they just they just dragged the folder over to a cd and then they were just like just to do that that's it that's that's it there's no options I can't do anything alt plus enter to switch window mode
[04:28.69]It's not working.
[04:37.11]It can't even... Okay, I'm done.
[04:39.21]That was Disney Infinity 3.0.
[04:41.98]Game can't fucking be played and streamed.
[04:45.18]It has to be played on a monitor that it chooses.
[04:49.14]So I'm going to get up and show my asshole on camera.
[04:59.91]What if I... Hold on, let me try this.
[05:05.73]Yeah, we won.
[05:06.89]We win.
[05:10.67]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[05:16.98]It's on this monitor now.
[05:18.22]It's okay.
[05:18.60]It's on the right monitor.
[05:20.36]But it won't capture.
[05:34.14]Capture it!
[05:40.01]Dude, and now it's on.
[05:41.09]I'm done.
[05:42.05]Fuck this game.
[05:42.85]Wait!
[05:59.10]Okay, count to 30.
[06:02.76]I want everyone to count to 30 because in 30 seconds, I'm moving on to the next game.
[06:06.92]And that was fun.
[06:07.51]I played Disney Infinity 3.0.
[06:08.63]It was a fun game.
[06:16.05]Count to 30 seconds.
