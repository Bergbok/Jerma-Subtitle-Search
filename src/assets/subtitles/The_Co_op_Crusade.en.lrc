[00:02.69]This is so loud and annoying.
[00:05.79]Fucking Gerald.
[00:06.96]This is a long opening cutscene.
[00:20.47]And what if it turns out me and you are these two guys?
[00:23.84]It won't be long before overrun.
[00:25.60]Alright, can we play?
[00:26.48]I want like 30 more points.
[00:27.74]But is this us?
[00:28.34]I think that this is supposed to be both of us.
[00:36.61]Alright, let's fucking play this dumb game.
[00:38.81]I take us now to where our story begins.
[00:41.69]What?
[00:42.83]Our story didn't just begin.
[00:44.77]In the kingdom of France, my family, February evening in the year 1199, my quest remains unfinished.
[00:51.36]As for Den's, his is about to begin.
[00:54.58]But as fate would have it, there is another hero who would be impossible to forget.
[00:59.52]There's too many people in this game.
[01:00.52]A priest with pretty tunics.
[01:01.60]I bet he wields that sword no better than a farmer.
[01:13.95]I wasn't this good.
[01:14.95]No, I was not doing this good What is that you I don't know
[01:43.02]Why is there a Mortal Kombat character here?
[01:44.60]All right, different universes.
[01:48.16]Where am I?
[01:49.28]What is happening?
[01:52.15]I died.
[01:53.21]He's going to kill me.
[01:59.05]Why are we in separate games?
[02:02.63]No!
[02:03.46]No, I'm skipping.
[02:04.84]Get us out of here.
[02:06.18]Hold on, I've hit space.
[02:07.70]You have to hit skip.
[02:11.96]Okay, you have to do the on-screen prompts.
[02:15.48]He's gonna kill me.
[02:19.60]DENZ IS A TALENTED SWORDSMAN.
[02:21.44]DENZ IS A TALENTED SWORDSMAN WHO HAS NEVER LET- Direct D, perform a normal attack, C, counter, co-op, STAR.
[02:31.48]Why does it say that?
[02:32.84]Why is it D, C, why wouldn't it be like A, B, C?
[02:36.87]Why is it star?
[02:37.85]No, because you're playing co-op with me.
[02:39.05]I'm playing co-op with you.
[02:39.77]Yeah.
[02:41.35]A lot of weird shit going on.
[02:42.55]That's performed when I grab an enemy.
[02:44.45]Okay, well... Gee, that's HML.
[02:47.51]The low isn't star.
[02:54.17]It's another character.
[02:57.08]He missed every arrow.
[02:58.10]Did you see how many arrows he just shot?
[02:59.56]He missed every one.
[03:00.98]They didn't even get close.
[03:02.06]They didn't even get close.
[03:02.70]They were all in unison.
[03:03.54]They landed right in front of these guys.
[03:04.62]Come on, you gotta do some more work.
[03:07.32]I'm doing all the work here on the left.
[03:10.61]Are you dead?
[03:25.23]um now's our chance let's go I got it right in the mouth did you I hit him right in the face and he just like put his hand up and wiped his face
[03:44.36]Do you feel like we're these guys on the right?
[03:46.46]Which characters are we right now?
[03:48.74]All of your audio is, like, on the left.
[03:51.25]Mine's all on the right or something.
[03:54.27]I just ran away.
[03:55.29]I just got... He just, like, took off.
[04:02.11]Oh, shit.
[04:02.55]This guy died.
[04:03.27]I'm out of here.
[04:06.12]Those guys on the left are dead.
[04:10.40]That guy got shot with a machine gun.
[04:14.34]So I can... You step out and... It's inverted.
[04:21.14]It's inverted.
[04:22.22]Mine's inverted.
[04:26.40]Shoot him.
[04:27.06]Shoot him.
[04:32.69]I don't even know... What the fuck?
[04:34.23]This guy... That was a bad guy.
[04:35.34]That was a bad guy.
[04:36.18]That was a bad guy.
[04:38.34]Okay.
[04:42.14]It could probably fit us both on the same screen.
[04:44.54]I know, really.
[04:46.52]It could probably just be one screen.
[04:48.12]We probably could be on one screen right now.
[04:50.54]I can't even... Is that an enemy?
[04:57.16]My enemy Tony...
[04:59.48]This is really giving me a headache.
[05:00.84]No, this is where we came from.
[05:01.82]Oh, shit.
[05:02.72]We're going the wrong way.
[05:07.03]Your turn now, Briggins.
[05:09.81]Is this a boss?
[05:11.05]I guess.
[05:11.67]All right, first boss fight.
[05:13.79]You ready?
[05:15.73]What's the strategy?
[05:17.13]Oh, get hit.
[05:18.99]All right, just co-op him.
[05:20.11]You ready?
[05:20.65]Yeah, just co-op him.
[05:21.38]Co-op him.
[05:27.04]Right into the fire.
[05:32.36]Oh, they got me.
[05:34.02]Good God, we co-opted.
[05:34.86]You know how to wield a blade.
[05:35.98]Yeah, you guys know how to do that.
[05:36.98]Let's see if you can wield fire half as well.
[05:40.78]Oh, shit, he's a demon.
[05:42.00]Hey, you ready to co-opt this guy?
[05:44.49]Yeah.
[06:02.33]Fucking useless enemy.
[06:09.58]Pope Innocent.
[06:13.66]Garen fucking T, that guy's a demon.
[06:16.00]You don't have a name like Pope Innocent III if you're not the bad guy of the whole game.
[06:23.47]It's funny because this is all historically accurate and it's probably a real guy.
[06:28.64]Here's the typical bored king.
[06:32.16]Eventually, I hope somebody makes me come from my sleep and see these two gentlemen.
[06:36.74]Oh, look, did you see how good they did?
[06:38.34]I'll speak to them now.
[06:49.66]You!
[06:51.06]You won't defeat me!
[07:02.44]This game sucks!
[07:06.94]Uh-oh.
[07:08.12]Rain is back.
[07:09.50]I hope he doesn't do a Brutality.
[07:13.49]You cannot hide from me.
[07:16.17]Tomorrow at sunrise, no one will be able to.
[07:21.03]I am dead.
[07:23.27]I cannot be vanished.
[07:25.95]First of all, our blades won't be enough to drive him back.
[07:29.02]Let's try the Sacred Flames.
[07:31.35]He's dead.
[07:32.01]No, we have to do the secret plan.
[07:37.37]No, he's dead.
[07:38.03]He's gone.
[07:38.49]We won.
[07:39.35]What?
[07:40.87]There was a whole plan.
[07:43.06]We couldn't even hear the whole plan.
[07:45.08]We co-opted him too fast.
[07:46.40]We couldn't even hear the plan.
[07:47.78]This is not normal.
[07:50.16]This is not, like, easy.
[07:51.42]The way they were talking, that wasn't even supposed to happen.
[07:53.64]It was like, you create a diversion and, like, we'll do a purifying flame.
[07:56.35]No.
[07:57.07]No, he's just dead.
[07:58.09]I pressed X.
