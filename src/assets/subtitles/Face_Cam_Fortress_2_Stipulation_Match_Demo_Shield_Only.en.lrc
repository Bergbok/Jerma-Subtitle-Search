[00:08.83]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.61]Jerma here with Face Burnt Jerma Sunburned Fortress 2.
[00:15.26]No, this is Face Game Fortress 2, Monday's edition, playing as the Demo Knight, as you see here.
[00:21.86]But this is going to be a very special Demo Man Demo Knight video because it's going to be a live stipulation match.
[00:28.90]Now, what is a stipulation match?
[00:33.25]It's that!
[00:33.89]It's where you're only allowed to do one very specific thing with a very weird loadout.
[00:38.08]Well, not really a weird loadout, but a weird set of guidelines.
[00:41.50]And this particular set of guidelines I'm using for this stipulation is shield only.
[00:48.00]So let's see if I can kill people with the shield in this live stipulation match.
[00:53.83]No!
[00:55.27]Ugh!
[00:57.59]So, I'm only allowed to kill people with the shield, that's it.
[01:00.50]If I try to use the sword, I am eliminated, even though I don't know why I would try to do that anyways.
[01:05.52]Unless it was on accident.
[01:07.52]But this could get very, very interesting.
[01:09.24]It could be very bad, too.
[01:10.50]I could just totally lose this entire thing and never kill one person, but that's the beauty of stipulation.
[01:18.00]Splendid screen.
[01:19.00]It does 70% more damage.
[01:20.36]That's why I'm using it.
[01:22.72]Map is high tower.
[01:24.66]And I gotta wait till I have a little bit lower health.
[01:27.90]Get smashed!
[01:29.44]Oh!
[01:31.72]Alright, there's one.
[01:32.68]There's one.
[01:33.10]I got one kill.
[01:34.28]I'm happy with that.
[01:36.70]Come on, who wants a shield in their face?
[01:41.79]Oh, this sniper does.
[01:42.69]This sniper does.
[01:44.83]Oh!
[01:47.11]He went flying off the edge!
[01:48.65]No, no.
[01:49.99]I get this guy too.
[01:50.69]Ready?
[01:50.87]Watch this.
[01:53.62]Come on, get him again.
[01:54.52]Get him again.
[01:54.88]I got the assist.
[01:55.44]I got the assist.
[01:58.99]Where is he?
[01:59.85]Oh my god, that was scary.
[02:04.37]Come on, come on.
[02:05.93]Oh, Scout.
[02:07.01]Oh, you don't even... No!
[02:07.79]Oh, I missed everybody!
[02:10.74]Oh my god!
[02:11.80]I'm in no man's land.
[02:12.88]Come on!
[02:13.64]Come on!
[02:14.48]Kill the Scout!
[02:15.28]Kill the Scout!
[02:17.64]Oh, no!
[02:21.86]If he had had less health, I would have killed him.
[02:26.01]Damn it!
[02:27.97]Well at least I've killed a couple people it's not a total failure Let's go again
[02:37.24]And if you're wondering, if you weren't at the livestream last night, you're wondering why I'm all burnt to a crisp, that's because I was at the beach the other day, and I wanted to get some color in my face a little bit before I went to Seattle for PAX Prime, and I stayed out a little too long in the sun.
[02:56.86]So hopefully I'm not a peeling mess when it comes to PAX Prime, and is anybody even... Nope, whatever, I'll get away.
[03:05.97]Hopefully I'm not a peeling mess before Pax Prime is what I was going to say.
[03:08.61]I probably already said that, but I just want to reiterate it again.
[03:10.87]Dude, this is actually pretty fun.
[03:14.61]This is, I'm not gonna lie, this is like fun.
[03:17.01]Some stipulations are really hard.
[03:18.27]Oh, ready?
[03:18.73]Watch this.
[03:20.09]Can I?
[03:22.49]Oh man, that would have been so epic if I'd hit somebody that ran around.
[03:25.24]It's alright, it's alright.
[03:27.24]I got my charge back.
[03:30.32]Who wants a shield planted in their skull?
[03:33.60]Oh, this Pyro does.
[03:35.24]What is this guy doing?
[03:40.85]Come on!
[03:42.05]One more time.
[03:42.77]One more time.
[03:43.75]He doesn't even know.
[03:44.53]He doesn't even know.
[03:45.63]He doesn't even know.
[03:47.55]Come on, turn around.
[03:50.17]Come on, one more time.
[03:51.61]One more time.
[03:52.17]Let me get it.
[03:55.08]It's alright, I'll get this spy.
[03:58.72]Oh, you went... Oh, which way are you going, Spy?
[04:01.22]You don't even try and stair stab me.
[04:03.56]Is that what you think you're gonna do?
[04:05.50]Is that what you think?
[04:08.90]Come on, why don't you stair stab me?
[04:10.52]Come on!
[04:11.08]What?
[04:11.26]How did that not connect?
[04:14.41]I am gonna get this, Spy.
[04:16.33]I am gonna get him.
[04:19.83]Don't... He's gonna... He's trying to stair stab me.
[04:22.05]This is his plan.
[04:25.47]No, he's gone.
[04:26.77]Damn it!
[04:27.21]He's gone.
[04:28.29]No, he's right there.
[04:28.93]He's right there.
[04:31.11]Oh, I could have had him right there.
[04:32.17]I had the chance.
[04:37.26]Where?
[04:37.48]Is he dead?
[04:38.38]Did I get him?
[04:40.16]I don't think I got him.
[04:40.88]I don't even know if he... Wait, why did it make the noise?
[04:47.22]It made, like, the run into you noise.
[04:50.50]Alright, come on, let's go, let's go.
[04:52.64]Got like a 19 second respawn, holy Toledo.
[04:59.10]It started out pretty well, I killed like two or three people in the beginning there.
[05:04.51]Livestipulation.com.edu.org.
[05:12.20]Oh no, the bomb has almost reached the final terminal.
[05:14.36]Alright, what do we got here?
[05:17.23]No!
[05:17.83]Oh, I just clicked.
[05:18.63]Good thing that was not a kill, because otherwise I would have been eliminated.
[05:22.77]And by eliminated, I mean... Just... I just... I swing and I lose.
[05:27.49]And here we go.
[05:30.73]I got this soldier right here.
[05:33.23]I got this soldier right here.
[05:35.85]He probably needs health.
[05:39.93]Oh, come on!
[05:40.98]That was... He was so toast.
[05:42.62]He was so dead.
[05:44.93]I'll get him again.
[05:45.39]He's gonna come around the corner, and I'm going to smash him, and he's gonna die.
[05:51.37]Come on, before he gets the sentry up.
[05:54.89]Oh, the soldier got him.
[05:56.14]Soldier got him.
[05:57.68]I think you are a spy.
[05:58.84]Yeah, you are.
[06:02.86]Come on.
[06:03.66]Come on, shoot me.
[06:04.62]Come on.
[06:05.22]Come on, shoot me.
[06:06.08]No!
[06:06.58]No!
[06:07.56]What?
[06:08.40]What the... How did he not die?
[06:11.26]Why didn't I run into him?
[06:13.79]I can't believe you didn't die from that!
[06:16.51]Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
[06:19.25]I think we're gonna win though, that's a good thing.
[06:21.39]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[06:25.00]Oh yeah, this is a win.
[06:27.56]This is a win, come on.
[06:33.54]So close, yet so far.
[06:37.20]This guy is like, he doesn't even know.
[06:43.20]Alright, it's 85.
[06:44.42]Gotta do it another, another, two, two, no, man!
[06:48.56]Man!
[06:48.96]I could've killed that guy, for sure.
[06:54.34]Oh, fine.
[06:56.10]Fine with me, man.
[06:59.70]Oh, this guy is hurt.
[07:02.08]Yes!
[07:03.72]Yeah!
[07:05.94]Oh my god!
[07:06.50]There's nothing I can do!
[07:11.50]Oh, he got, I got the assist.
[07:15.58]I gotta try and knock somebody off the edge, like I did that sniper before.
[07:19.74]What the hell's... Why did that guy... Why did that guy just run off the edge?
[07:27.27]That guy just literally walked off the edge.
[07:29.35]And I would've... Oh my god.
[07:34.39]Well, that's one... What is going on?
[07:38.13]Everyone's just dying.
[07:39.07]I think we're gonna win this right now, though.
[07:42.22]Yes?
[07:42.48]Yes?
[07:43.32]Yes?
[07:45.31]No?
[07:45.61]Yeah?
[07:46.77]Yeah, we got it for sure.
[07:47.77]Hell yeah, nice.
[07:51.79]Stimulation match.
[07:53.69]Medic, heal me, please!
[07:54.85]Heal me!
[07:55.58]Oh, I gotta get off the cliff!
[07:56.32]Gotta jump off the cliff!
[07:57.04]Come on!
[07:58.16]Jump off the cliff!
[07:59.22]Come on!
[08:00.56]Oh, yeah.
[08:02.94]Well, uh, that's gonna wrap it up for Face Game Fortress 2, live stipulation match number one.
[08:07.75]I'll probably be doing these a lot more often because they're just goofy and fun and ridiculous.
[08:12.79]But I'm gonna do one more life.
[08:14.55]Because I feel like I can kill one person again.
[08:16.85]Here we go.
[08:20.66]Oh, too many people over there.
[08:22.78]I gotta wait till somebody is injured.
[08:26.08]Wow, that guy just direct shot at me.
[08:27.40]Are you kidding me?
[08:28.76]This guy right here.
[08:29.30]Like, this guy right here.
[08:29.96]This guy's dead.
[08:35.96]Come on, I don't even care if I get hit.
[08:37.02]I just gotta get him.
[08:39.28]Yes!
[08:42.26]Alright, it's up still on the same life.
[08:45.61]Come on.
[08:46.73]Can I get... I wanna get up there.
[08:49.83]We got... Oh my god, that's a sentry.
[08:51.71]Take out the sentry.
[08:52.81]Engineer's going down.
[08:53.53]Oh, that was mine.
[08:57.39]That was mine.
[08:59.99]Oh, this guy's toast.
[09:00.85]He doesn't have any idea I'm behind him.
[09:06.79]Come on, come on.
[09:09.82]Oh, you... Son of a... Son of a bee.
[09:16.64]That spy is not one of us.
[09:17.92]That spy is an enemy.
[09:18.84]That spy is not one of us.
[09:19.70]That spy is you!
[09:21.63]I just slid off of him like he was covered in butter.
[09:24.05]That was stupid.
[09:26.31]Yikes.
[09:26.91]Oh, this is my end right here.
[09:30.11]No!
[09:31.11]Ah...
[09:34.24]Oh well.
[09:35.08]But that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[09:36.28]Thank you so much for watching.
[09:37.44]Really do appreciate it.
[09:38.78]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[09:40.26]And of course, take care, everybody.
