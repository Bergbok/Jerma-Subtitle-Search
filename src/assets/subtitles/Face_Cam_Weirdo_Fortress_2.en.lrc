[00:03.24]I mean, the universe is such a large place, and it's a little disheartening that we don't spend more time and more effort with the research and development into certain things like the theory of relativity, for instance.
[00:15.17]I mean, I'm not sure exactly why we don't spend that much money.
[00:17.93]I would implore the Congress and the Senate to do that, and it truly is a beautiful thing.
[00:26.96]Did I just kill that many people?
[00:38.60]What is this?
[00:40.34]Look at how dirty this is.
[00:43.25]It's like a... This was in my pocket, by the way, of these pants.
[00:46.85]You can't see them.
[00:50.09]I have no... I must have blown my nose in that and wiped it on the concrete.
[00:55.21]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:56.09]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2.
[00:57.95]It's been a while since the last Facecam Fortress, but let's go cow-mangling.
[01:01.25]What?
[01:07.34]Okay.
[01:09.90]I'm going to show this to you because this doesn't make any sense.
[01:12.53]I don't know if I can get this in the camera.
[01:15.71]This is my keyboard.
[01:20.61]That's my jump button.
[01:22.19]Can you...
[01:25.62]How did they get those pita pockets?
[01:27.16]You know the little pita pockets that they make that you get at the grocery store?
[01:30.57]How do they put those inside the pita?
[01:33.15]Like, how do they make the bread like that?
[01:34.97]That's... They can't make it.
[01:36.49]It's impossible.
[01:37.15]Like, you need the dough to settle.
[01:39.41]You need there to be... Am I missing?
[01:42.48]I'm missing.
[01:43.22]You need the dough...
[01:46.70]I can't believe it.
[01:47.76]You know, the dough seriously needs to settle it.
[01:50.24]And I don't know what kind of dough you use, but the dough that I use is truly, it sucks.
[01:55.73]It doesn't rise correctly.
[01:57.43]It smells a little bit.
[01:58.55]It smells kind of like cheese and farts.
[02:16.20]Heh heh.
[02:29.47]Heh heh.
[03:05.38]Come on.
[03:07.46]Come on.
[03:08.98]Somebody come over here.
[03:10.46]Somebody just walk over here right now.
[03:13.29]Come on.
[03:14.67]I could wait all day.
[03:16.29]I got plenty of coffee.
[03:20.57]I got plenty of time.
[03:22.63]Come on.
[03:38.66]At least I killed somebody with that.
[03:39.88]This is the face I make when I'm really fucking mad.
[03:52.49]Now I'm mad.
[03:53.71]You made me fucking mad.
[03:55.31]Now it's time to show you how we do things.
[04:05.82]Get behind enemy lines.
[04:08.00]And start stabbing.
[04:09.90]Get, like, a nine-person chain stab.
[04:14.16]Nobody up there.
[04:14.86]No snipers.
[04:17.00]What about back here?
[04:21.10]The only person on, like, red team is this, like, poor heavy.
[04:24.41]That's about to... You know what?
[04:25.27]We're not gonna kill this guy.
[04:26.15]I'm not gonna kill this guy.
[04:28.71]Yeah.
[04:29.03]Hey, what's up, man?
[04:29.71]You got that health?
[04:31.39]He's like, hey!
[04:32.13]What was that?
[04:33.19]Ha ha ha!
[04:33.43]Ha ha ha!
[04:36.62]Who's your spy?
[04:37.98]I love how he's spy checking these guys, but not me.
[04:41.94]Come on.
[04:42.80]Come on, walk right into that crosshair.
[04:46.72]Wasn't the same guy, but it's okay.
[04:50.46]I don't want to get shot in the face.
[04:51.62]That's the number one thing I don't want to have happen accidentally by one of these snipers.
[05:00.49]There was three, and we lost because I wasn't capping the point.
[05:06.30]Come on, kill me, baby!
[05:07.44]Baby speed!
[05:08.02]Come on!
[05:08.58]Turn around!
[05:09.60]Please turn around!
[05:11.32]Turn around, please!
[05:13.03]Shoot me!
[05:14.59]Shoot me!
[05:15.47]I'm trying to walk in front of him.
[05:20.03]Oh my god.
[05:30.36]No, there's another one.
[05:32.59]There's two!
[05:33.85]Oh no!
[05:34.22]They're gonna double team me!
[05:37.42]Hold on a sec.
[05:43.88]They both have... They both have gibbouses on.
[05:48.00]They're both just like...
[06:17.30]Headshot.
[06:18.58]Headshot.
[06:20.48]Headshot.
[06:21.72]Oh, and he landed and died.
[06:23.38]Get another headshot.
[06:28.73]Excuse me, what would you like?
[06:30.59]No, it's a Pyro and he's gonna get me.
[06:32.05]I'm burning.
[06:35.21]It's over.
[06:35.75]I'm burnt.
[06:36.93]Star Wars killed me.
[06:40.03]George Lucas presents Star Wars.
[06:42.79]Gets the kill on Jerma.
[06:44.51]Or Greg.
[06:48.21]Are we really getting this badly destroyed right now?
[06:50.65]We didn't even cap it once.
[06:52.11]How did this even happen?
[06:53.07]I don't even know.
[06:54.81]How did we do that?
[06:57.26]What?
[07:05.02]Yes.
[07:12.25]Yes.
[07:12.47]Yes.
[07:13.85]Yes.
[07:20.29]Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[07:21.29]I really do appreciate it.
[07:22.09]I don't know what... Three health.
[07:23.83]Great.
[07:24.61]I'm very good at that.
[07:26.43]I'm very good to... Redo.
[07:30.63]Redo.
[07:31.47]Just... Cut that out.
[07:33.96]Just take in the file, in the video file, make a cut, and then drag that piece to the other piece to get rid of that fucking part.
[07:44.51]Talking to you, Jerma.
[07:46.10]Don't leave this in.
[07:47.24]Don't accidentally leave this in.
[07:48.68]I know you're going to accidentally leave this in.
[07:50.56]And the people are going to say, you accidentally left this part in.
[07:54.71]And then I'm going to say, what are you even talking about?
[07:57.55]I didn't leave it in.
[07:59.69]I was just... Now I'm seriously being an idiot.
[08:04.58]Thank you so much for watching.
[08:05.34]I really do appreciate it, guys.
[08:06.88]Oh my god.
[08:10.34]Crate 57.
[08:13.04]I can't wait to open it.
