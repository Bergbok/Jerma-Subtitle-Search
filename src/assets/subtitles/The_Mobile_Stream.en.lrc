[00:02.83]I didn't even fix it.
[00:04.48]I didn't even do a title.
[00:07.08]Well, that's unfortunate.
[00:09.62]Hi, guys.
[00:10.02]How are you?
[00:13.58]It's been an interesting few weeks.
[00:17.00]Today's the day, though.
[00:18.70]Today's the day that we're going to actually fly.
[00:21.71]Today's the day that I unfortunately, you know, got to share a flight.
[00:28.21]That's like the weird thing that I have to worry about.
[00:30.03]But I've been preparing.
[00:34.30]Hope everyone's having a good day.
[00:38.65]Gotta prepare myself.
[00:39.85]I need some snacks.
[00:48.10]Does it look okay?
[00:49.78]Yeah, you look good.
[00:51.36]Do I really or are you just saying that?
[00:53.52]It's okay.
[00:54.16]What are people saying here?
[00:58.78]It's breakfast time.
[01:00.61]IRL stream.
[01:01.41]What the fuck is this 4 a.m.
[01:02.81]stream?
[01:05.41]Just relax.
[01:07.11]I've had a stressful few weeks, like I told you.
[01:08.99]Okay, make sure I've got everything.
[01:13.73]So yeah, just for the purposes of the future, I just want everybody to know that I'm very happy and I'm very thankful for all of you for being here and helping me over the last few years, the last two or three years of streaming on Twitch.
[01:27.91]Las Vegas is incoming.
[01:31.78]And I got the pre-Vegas jitters, I'm not gonna lie.
[01:36.52]I've been a little shaky these last couple of days, but it's okay.
[01:40.20]Got my Velveeta cheese, I got my bread, and I got my drink.
[01:44.34]It's as easy as it'll be.
[01:48.40]As easy as it'll be.
[01:49.70]That's not a lawnmower.
[01:52.69]I've taken the only way you should fly, the absolute only way you should fly, ladies and gentlemen, I've taken a goddamn balloon to Las Vegas.
[02:07.57]Unfortunately, you have to buy... Look, buying plane tickets are a little too expensive, okay?
[02:16.94]Plane rides, it's... We're all going.
[02:20.36]I don't really know these people, but I was told that you just gotta bring enough for the class, is what I was told.
[02:26.87]Come back this way.
[02:28.43]Come back this way.
[02:29.29]Come back this way.
[02:32.97]I know that's interesting, but... I mean, there's me.
[02:36.03]What's more interesting than me?
[02:41.73]I was told it's about, depending on the wind, I guess, it could be about 3 to 17 days.
[02:51.13]So it's a decent amount of time, at least to get myself out there and get settled.
[03:00.10]Finally have internet out here.
[03:01.28]Not in Vegas yet, of course, because this is the last day.
[03:05.58]That is actually bigger than I thought it was going to be.
[03:09.18]By the way, I am terrified of heights.
[03:11.84]Absolutely terrified of heights.
[03:13.82]It's one of my least favorite things in the world.
[03:16.56]But you've got to come out.
[03:18.10]It's a little cheaper, and it's a little nicer, and a little more Las Vegas flair.
[03:22.78]So please, don't tell me I don't know what I'm doing with my own money.
[03:27.94]Let me see that, Mr. Cameraman.
[03:30.99]Don't let go of it, please.
[03:33.25]How do I do this?
[03:34.97]How do I do the selfie bug?
[03:40.23]Like that.
[03:42.45]I can't.
[03:42.75]There we go.
[03:44.11]What are you guys saying?
[03:49.17]Don't do that.
[03:49.90]Stay on the ground.
[03:50.60]How am I supposed to get to Las Vegas?
[03:52.58]How am I supposed to get there?
[03:54.46]He's classic Dave.
[04:04.09]My name's not Dave.
[04:09.86]taking a goddamn balloon to Vegas.
[04:11.81]You don't think I have the flair?
[04:13.31]You don't think that I have, that I'm not gonna be the flair, the guy with the flair on this platform?
[04:17.63]You're crazy.
[04:18.15]I just got this new phone too, it's pretty good.
[04:24.63]It's an iPhone Eximus, however they pronounce it, right?
[04:29.97]Literally nobody said that.
[04:31.23]You just, you just did.
[04:32.67]I don't know how loud this is.
[04:34.81]What is the title of the stream?
[04:38.89]How do I, like, can I, can a mod, like, look at how tired I look.
[04:41.69]I look like shit.
[04:46.07]Can a mod change this to, here we go to Vegas?
[04:50.88]Is that, like, possible?
[04:57.16]The phone will be dropped.
[04:59.16]I'm not gonna drop the phone.
[05:04.14]Flying that thing to Vegas, baby.
[05:08.24]We're going, the trajectory apparently goes like this, so it goes from, starts in Massachusetts, then flies with a crosswind over Kentucky, right?
[05:20.41]Kentucky then, it takes you up over Canada, the way that I guess the weather is, up over Canada, down back towards Oklahoma, and then from Oklahoma...
[05:31.98]It goes straight across over to Las Vegas.
[05:34.43]If you go over, like, a couple of mountains, I was told just to be careful because actually the thing could, like, scrape a mountain, and I'm like, I'll be fine.
[05:42.57]We're all going to Vegas.
[05:44.31]It doesn't matter.
[05:46.77]See, that's a flat Earth.
[05:51.96]Just takes them a few minutes to blow it up.
[05:57.42]I'm in Canada.
[06:01.56]We're not coming to your house.
[06:03.65]We might fly over your house.
[06:05.69]Just look up there.
[06:07.11]Look up.
[06:08.51]After this is done, I'm going to give quarterly updates here every like 20 minutes.
[06:13.91]So my iPhone X looks pretty good.
[06:19.62]It's 7 a.m.
[06:20.34]where I am right now.
[06:21.00]That's correct.
[06:25.60]Yeah, look at the sky.
[06:26.46]If you look at the sky, you're going to look up and it's going to be like, whoa, there he is.
[06:30.30]There he is.
[06:30.90]Nice voice crack.
[06:32.74]There he is.
[06:33.16]He's going over.
[06:34.54]Wow, it's like Santa.
[06:35.42]You know like how you can track Santa?
[06:38.00]You can track me.
[06:39.78]Just type in hashtag Jarvis Balloon to Vegas.
[06:46.71]There he is.
[06:47.45]I see him.
[06:47.97]I'm not up there yet.
[06:50.71]Dab or pre-recorded.
[06:52.11]I'm not going to do that.
[06:56.40]I'm so looking forward to this, though.
[06:57.72]It's been a long time coming.
[07:05.67]Free recording.
[07:06.59]Free recording.
[07:07.31]Yeah.
[07:07.69]No, not today.
[07:10.15]Let me flip it around for you, cameraman.
[07:16.97]But, like, seriously, though, like, honest to God, like, I...
[07:20.26]Like, just don't fuck this up, okay?
[07:22.40]I'm so sorry.
[07:23.85]You're really, like, starting to irritate me.
[07:25.99]Where were you for that one?
[07:27.31]I'll get it right.
[07:28.29]I'm holding the fucking camera myself.
[07:29.81]I paid you $20 to do this.
[07:32.31]I'm sorry.
[07:35.93]Just make this... Get a good shot of me going up, you know what I mean?
[07:39.04]When I go in the air, and then, like, I want you to get a good... I want you to make sure... People are going to think it's fucking pre-recorded.
[07:44.76]Okay, all right.
[07:45.38]So just make sure to get me going through the air, and then...
[07:48.16]Like, get a good shot of it.
[07:49.40]Will you send the money when you get there?
[07:50.96]Yeah.
[07:52.84]All right.
[07:53.20]That's a nice camera if you don't fuck it up.
[07:57.16]Okay, but yeah, looks like we're gonna be getting close here.
[08:01.56]You know when you share a seat with somebody on the airplane, and you're in the middle seat, and you're like, oh, what the heck?
[08:06.45]This guy's on my one elbow.
[08:07.75]This guy's on my left elbow.
[08:09.93]I didn't want to charter the whole thing.
[08:12.71]There's people going to Vegas, too.
[08:14.05]Maybe we can go together.
[08:16.94]You know, when you're in the middle like that, it's a bonding experiment.
[08:19.72]You know, you're like, oh, hey, where are you going?
[08:21.64]You're going to Vegas?
[08:22.46]Oh, wow, you're going to be gambling?
[08:24.16]Yeah, get the fuck off my, you're on my thing there, man, but it's all right.
[08:28.02]Hey, what about you?
[08:29.14]You're going to Vegas, too?
[08:30.44]Yeah, yeah, get, yep, thank you.
[08:32.31]I'll take that.
[08:32.97]I'll take it.
[08:33.43]Please, please give it to me.
[08:36.31]How are we doing on burning time here?
[08:38.59]We're like an asshole, huh?
[08:39.65]Let's get one more of these.
[08:46.51]Right outside my window.
[08:55.84]Stream delay, he's up already.
[08:59.56]Not yet.
[09:07.22]Who is that?
[09:09.26]Who is who?
[09:11.85]You talking about the other Vegas crew?
[09:15.09]Guy.
[09:17.42]I don't know, we have to all sign waivers and shit because apparently, oh, you're going over Tornado County.
[09:26.16]Whoa!
[09:29.62]I told you I paid for flamethrowers.
[09:31.32]I told you I paid for burning and fire.
[09:32.94]I'm going to be inside of that.
[09:50.46]Yeah, I purchased a dragon.
[09:57.90]There it goes.
[10:00.54]But what I was saying is, so this is going over Tornado County.
[10:04.60]So the one thing I got to be careful of is actually, you know, tornado stick.
[10:09.44]I'm talking.
[10:10.84]I'm talking.
[10:11.71]It keeps interrupting me.
[10:18.93]Well, there you go.
[10:25.65]Okay.
[10:27.87]Look at that.
[10:30.31]Looks nice and beautiful over there.
[10:40.04]That's a big balloon.
[10:41.14]That's bigger than I thought it was going to be.
[10:44.92]You know, like I said, you've got different kinds of airplanes, you've got different kinds of balloons, too.
[11:00.84]Did you say talk to strangers?
[11:10.62]This is like Dr. Strange's shitty cousin.
[11:13.00]Like, odd Michael.
[11:19.53]Okay, so.
[11:22.21]Just gonna bring it down a little here.
[11:26.97]So we're going to Las Vegas.
[11:28.15]Might as well play the part, right?
[11:31.54]I've got my food, I've got my beverages.
[11:35.00]Viva Las Vegas.
[11:50.04]Just remember, watch the cars over there.
[11:54.16]I don't want you to see anything.
[11:56.93]Okay.
[11:58.37]What a dick.
[12:05.39]Are you guys ready for Pagas?
[12:08.07]We're ready.
[12:08.55]It's a long ways away, but we can do it.
[12:11.51]Like 17 or 18 days is what I was told?
[12:13.45]Yeah.
[12:13.77]OK, that's good.
[12:14.29]OK, so just climb on in.
[12:35.18]This is fun.
[12:36.72]This is going to be a fun trip, I think.
[12:40.92]Okay, so do you need to be there for this picture?
[12:45.85]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:46.95]Give me.
[12:47.59]Take this.
[12:48.13]Give me those snacks.
[12:51.05]Thanks.
[12:53.57]Hey, make sure you get the arm.
[12:55.55]Make sure who gets the arm right.
[12:57.06]Who's going to get the armband?
[12:58.08]In the middle seat?
[12:58.96]Okay.
[13:00.71]I work at Riverside.
[13:01.73]We have a lot of snakes.
[13:03.41]Where's Elvis?
[13:04.03]Where's Elvis?
[13:04.69]I'll help you find him.
[13:06.33]I'll help you find Elvis.
[13:08.69]I'm much bigger...
[13:23.41]You got a long ride, you better get started.
[13:25.87]Long ways to Vegas, you better get going.
[13:49.01]Is there anybody ahead of us in a taxi or no?
[13:53.43]For takeoff?
[13:55.09]You're all set.
[13:57.35]I know sometimes you get on the tarmac and you sit there, you know.
[14:00.21]The only thing holding you back is the... I don't know, is there room for Al too?
[14:08.56]In the van, sure.
[14:09.36]Yeah, as long as everybody doesn't mind crowding in.
[14:12.46]Okay.
[15:05.40]Can we get a Viva Las Vegas?
[15:07.16]Viva Las Vegas!
[15:09.62]Hey, boy, you've got my phone.
[15:11.70]Do you need your phone?
[15:13.02]You've got my phone.
[15:14.88]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[15:17.32]Come back down, Beth.
[15:18.49]Come back down.
[15:19.05]I need that phone.
[15:19.95]It's an iPhone X. Does he really need it?
[15:24.05]Just mail it to me.
[15:24.85]Okay, he doesn't need it, Beth.
[15:26.05]Go.
[15:26.61]Just mail it to me.
[15:27.65]You know what?
[15:27.95]You've got it.
[15:30.39]I thought you really needed it.
[15:41.50]She doesn't need it, Beth!
[16:01.03]In that bag.
[16:53.41]keeping this phone.
[17:25.84]I'm German now.
[18:31.44]Safe travels, Jerma.
