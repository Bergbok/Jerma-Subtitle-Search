[00:06.94]Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[00:10.24]Welcome back to JermaCraft.
[00:13.00]I know it's been quite a while since I came out with a JermaCraft episode, but I'm going to give you a whole list of excuses right now.
[00:20.91]Alright.
[00:22.49]So the holidays were around.
[00:24.51]Why am I holding my bed?
[00:26.99]What happened last episode?
[00:30.55]My bed should be in here, right?
[00:32.53]Yes.
[00:33.74]Okay, so what happened is obviously the holidays came around, and I didn't really have a whole lot of time to play this game.
[00:40.96]Because it takes a while.
[00:42.16]You've got to sit down and really do stuff for a couple hours, and I didn't really have that couple hours to really sit down and play.
[00:48.51]So, but now I do.
[00:50.31]So let's start playing, huh?
[00:53.59]What is going on here?
[00:55.49]What is going on with the side of my house?
[00:58.50]Jeez Louise.
[01:01.14]Okay, I know.
[01:01.66]I want that there.
[01:02.22]I want that there.
[01:04.13]So today we're going to do a couple of things in this episode.
[01:07.81]I'm going to do this.
[01:09.91]I'm going to go on a grand adventure.
[01:12.75]Because obviously, if you watched from the very beginning in episode one, I said, oh, don't worry, by Christmas time I'll have a castle.
[01:22.78]And as you can completely, totally tell, that is absolutely not happening and did not happen.
[01:28.56]So I'm going to go out and go on a crazy adventure and try to kill a bunch of stuff.
[01:34.19]Okay, I got the sword now.
[01:35.25]We're good.
[01:36.97]Do I need anything else?
[01:38.50]Oh, gotta eat this rotten flesh before I die.
[01:42.40]Keep eating it.
[01:44.26]Oh yeah, poisoned.
[01:46.19]So let's just go.
[01:47.77]I'm gonna go out there.
[01:48.41]I'm gonna try and find a new...
[01:52.14]spot to hang out.
[01:53.72]Because in reality, realistically, this is just too far away from all of civilization.
[02:00.27]So I'm going to have to find somewhere else.
[02:01.79]So say goodbye to this house for now.
[02:06.23]I don't think, I don't know if I'll ever come back to it or not, but yeah, let's say goodbye.
[02:10.67]Let's wave to the stupid sea house that never really went anywhere.
[02:17.14]So I'm going to sing a goodbye song to the castle that never was.
[02:22.52]So as we see it in the distance there, let's all wave goodbye to it.
[02:25.54]Goodbye.
[02:26.00]And let's sing my song to the castle.
[02:29.76]It starts raining.
[02:35.26]It started raining.
[02:36.40]Oh, my God.
[02:37.08]Perfect.
[02:37.48]My castle never ended up completing.
[02:56.71]And I'm scared of what's gonna happen in the next episode.
[03:02.38]But it's okay if we stay true to each other.
[03:05.32]We get up on the mountainside and find some other place to live.
[03:10.27]Goodbye, castle.
[03:13.81]I gotta find my way up and down the stairs.
[03:16.61]I'm gonna find my way inside of this mountain cab.
[03:19.31]We're gonna go.
[03:21.56]Goodbye, castle.
[03:25.55]And that's how we go, we end the song there.
[03:28.39]Let's just, why am I going this way?
[03:32.03]Goodbye, castle.
[03:33.47]It was great knowing you.
[03:36.79]Let's go.
[03:40.92]You're probably wondering why I'm back in the castle.
[03:44.30]It's because I didn't take any of this stuff that I'm supposed to take.
[03:48.40]I left it all here.
[03:50.06]So I'm going to take that.
[03:51.02]That stuff can stay.
[03:54.14]I need the bed, though.
[03:54.98]The bed is an absolute must, and I left without it.
[03:58.34]So, okay, bye now, castle.
[04:00.90]Bye.
[04:03.71]Trying to get up this whole mountain here is kind of being a little more difficult than I initially thought it was going to be.
[04:10.27]I have to scale this whole mountain, and I'm trying to do that.
[04:15.03]And, well, it's cold here.
[04:16.55]Oh, well.
[04:19.05]Trying to jump up here.
[04:19.91]I just can't get over here.
[04:22.37]Maybe I should just make it... I'm, like, really seriously trying to think of a good way to do this.
[04:31.05]How to make it... Maybe I should make the next house on top of this mountain, maybe?
[04:36.99]I don't know, but I'm... Whoa, what?
[04:39.21]What?
[04:39.67]Oh, God, I'm starving to death again.
[04:42.48]How many times is this going to happen to me?
[04:45.34]Eating raw beef.
[04:46.92]Oh, my... You know what?
[04:47.72]I'm going to eat the whole damn thing.
[04:50.01]Oh, hey, that's my ringtone.
[04:51.45]Hold on, somebody's calling me.
[04:54.87]My ringtone's a duck, if you can hear that.
[04:57.33]Hold on, I've got to answer this.
[04:59.19]Hold on.
[05:01.26]Hello?
[05:03.10]Hi, Mom.
[05:05.64]What's up?
[05:08.62]I'm making a commentary for YouTube.
[05:13.93]Yeah.
[05:15.19]So I made it on top of the mountain.
[05:17.06]That's a good thing.
[05:18.24]So do I build my house here is the real question.
[05:23.26]I don't know.
[05:23.82]You know what?
[05:24.10]I'm going to build it down here because this is just going to be a pain in the ass if I ever decide to do anything.
[05:30.11]So I'm going to come down here.
[05:32.13]I'm going to die if I jump down there.
[05:34.55]Do not die.
[05:35.25]If I die right now, it is a very, very bad thing because I really don't want to come all the way back here again.
[05:43.15]Alright, we're good.
[05:44.21]We're doing some scaling, some good mountains.
[05:46.21]Oh, look at that.
[05:46.69]Look at that parkour.
[05:48.95]Alright.
[05:49.93]Right here.
[05:50.23]I'm going to do it right here.
[05:51.95]The house is going to be built right here.
[05:54.71]Good shore view.
[05:55.77]Got a nice little spot right here.
[05:57.05]Going right here.
[05:59.13]Eventually, I'm sure I'll put wood here.
[06:02.20]Or maybe I might even just go back to the old house to, you know, scavenge the supplies.
[06:07.88]I don't know.
[06:09.25]But I had to get out of that place.
[06:11.55]That place was ridiculous.
[06:13.75]And that reminds me of a story.
[06:16.63]Story time.
[06:17.73]Okay.
[06:18.81]We can talk about story time right now.
[06:21.38]So, when I say get out of this place, it brought me back to when I was in college.
[06:26.50]When I was in college... Hold on, let me... I got plenty of dirt.
[06:30.10]I can make a little quasi-fake house here.
[06:33.82]Okay, so when I was in college, I lived in the dormitories for a couple years, right?
[06:40.63]And then I decided to move.
[06:42.21]Obviously, when you're like a junior and a senior in college, you want to move to like the bigger, cooler like apartments because you want to be like a cool person.
[06:48.85]Like I'm not in the dorm.
[06:49.83]I'm in the apartments because I'm the man.
[06:53.02]That's kind of what goes through your head sometimes.
[06:55.58]So I got an apartment, and I got the apartment without looking at it.
[06:59.24]I didn't really know, because I was late to put my thing in to get signed up for the dormitories.
[07:04.25]So I kind of had no choice.
[07:05.27]I had to just kind of run and find an apartment last minute.
[07:09.05]And I found this little place.
[07:10.55]I didn't see it.
[07:11.51]I just knew that it existed.
[07:13.15]It was about, I don't know, maybe half a mile away from the college.
[07:17.01]So I made a phone call, got the whole thing secured.
[07:19.89]Okay, let me get the lease.
[07:20.75]So where is it?
[07:21.29]Blah, blah, blah.
[07:22.53]And I came to realize, I came to find out later when I actually went there, that it was a box.
[07:28.57]The place wasn't even a house.
[07:29.91]It was just literally a box like this.
[07:31.79]Just like, it was like this big.
[07:35.31]It was one little, it was a studio apartment, right?
[07:37.66]So it was one small room with a bathroom like right over there.
[07:42.20]And it was horrible.
[07:43.50]And I had to live there.
[07:44.28]I had to share it with somebody.
[07:46.17]So I had this one box room that was probably... I'm going to be realistic.
[07:50.71]It was probably really as big as this Minecraft room I just made.
[07:55.67]And I had to share it with two people.
[07:57.13]Well, one person.
[07:57.81]So we had two people in there.
[07:59.48]But I just remember that it was one of the most ridiculous things ever.
[08:03.82]And I had to stay there for the whole year.
[08:06.47]So I guess the moral of the story is if you're going to live somewhere, make sure you check out where it is first besides just buying it and being like, yeah, I'll show up, thanks.
[08:18.10]Because I had a lot of bad experiences there.
[08:21.24]It just got to me after a while.
[08:23.78]It just stressed me out.
[08:25.70]The fact that there was just this tiny little room and I had no privacy.
[08:31.14]I was sitting right next to the person that lived right next to me.
[08:34.53]So it really, really was a real pain in the ass.
[08:38.55]Yeah, but that's the story of Jerma's box house that he really actually existed and lived in.
[08:45.77]I eventually moved out of there, though.
[08:47.06]I got out and I went back to live with some of my friends in college.
[08:50.80]But yeah, don't ever buy real estate without seeing it or you'll puke.
[08:56.22]Alright, let's get this thing.
[08:58.42]This should be the last layer right here.
[09:00.90]Then I should be able to make the roof, put the bed down, put a couple lights in it, and go to sleep.
