[00:08.85]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.20]Jerma here with some more... What the hell was that?
[00:14.08]Some more Call of Duty Black Ops 2 party games.
[00:16.76]This one is actually called Sticks and Stones, where you only get to use ballistic knives, knives, and the crossbow, this thing.
[00:29.01]Oh, get stuck.
[00:31.57]This is on that boat map again.
[00:34.51]For a second, I thought that was an actual plate.
[00:37.54]Get stuck.
[00:39.15]Oh boy.
[00:40.23]Oh boy.
[00:40.63]Oh boy.
[00:41.11]Oh boy.
[00:41.57]Oh boy.
[00:41.99]Guy right here.
[00:43.59]Come here.
[00:44.77]Just double tap him.
[00:46.91]Nice.
[00:49.49]Whoa.
[00:49.95]Whoa.
[00:51.55]Those things explode.
[00:52.57]Yikes.
[00:53.69]I'm going up there.
[00:55.19]I'm coming up there, man.
[00:55.85]I'm going to give you a Christmas card that you're going to want to send back.
[01:00.17]I heard an explosion.
[01:00.99]Yeah.
[01:05.04]Melee kill.
[01:06.26]Can I jump down there?
[01:08.28]Oh, you also get the tomahawk, too, with a throwing knife.
[01:10.02]Oh, I'm gonna throwing knife this guy right in the back.
[01:14.82]Or in the front.
[01:16.42]Or in his face.
[01:17.76]That works, too.
[01:20.56]Pull this back out, this thing.
[01:23.74]Oh.
[01:26.06]I don't know where to go.
[01:30.44]Shoot down.
[01:30.86]Let's just shoot down that hallway, just to scare him.
[01:37.38]Oh, man, did I get a double?
[01:38.56]Oh, I thought it went through the guy.
[01:41.22]Wow!
[01:44.64]Dude, my face.
[01:46.00]I just planted my face into the wall.
[01:48.86]That was ridiculous.
[01:51.61]Holy crap, that was insanity.
[01:53.41]Get tomahawked.
[01:55.59]Nobody was even there.
[02:01.35]There's a dude in there.
[02:02.59]He's sitting right here.
[02:06.88]Screw this!
[02:07.86]No!
[02:10.52]Oh, God!
[02:13.16]That thing is terrifying, huh?
[02:14.48]You know, I'm just gonna use the ballistic knives, man.
[02:16.08]These things are deadly.
[02:18.70]Oh, come on!
[02:20.55]No, don't!
[02:20.97]Please don't kill me!
[02:21.79]No!
[02:22.15]Stab him!
[02:23.99]Reload!
[02:28.63]What's this?
[02:34.49]Oh, you got smashed!
[02:38.31]I'm going to take this out.
[02:43.02]I don't like that thing.
[02:43.88]I'm not good with that thing.
[02:48.10]Skewered.
[02:48.52]I don't have any more bullets with it, though.
[02:50.64]Or ammo.
[02:52.66]With the knives, not this thing.
[02:53.90]Now I've got to use this thing.
[02:55.95]I don't even want to use this thing.
[02:58.27]Got him.
[02:59.25]Oh, bang!
[03:04.30]Hello.
[03:06.12]Oh boy.
[03:07.16]Screw it.
[03:08.08]At least I got my ballistics back.
[03:12.90]These things are where it's at.
[03:16.56]Oh, someone's gonna get it.
[03:18.57]I'm just gonna throw it over the whole map.
[03:22.41]See what happens.
[03:24.43]If I get a kill for that, that would be so hilarious.
[03:29.90]Whoa, whoa.
[03:31.16]Easy.
[03:31.88]Easy, buddy.
[03:33.00]Easy.
[03:33.66]Easy!
[03:34.98]D'oh!
[03:35.28]What?
[03:35.46]That guy was, like, running... What is this end?
[03:41.54]How long are the rounds?
[03:42.90]These things are pretty damn long.
[03:46.52]Oh, you're wrapping back around.
[03:48.45]Are ya?
[03:49.13]Oh, get bankrupted.
[03:53.33]This guy's got that explosive scary thing.
[03:59.44]What, what, what on earth is happening right now?
[04:06.08]Oh, get blown up!
[04:06.90]Oh, get blown up!
[04:07.98]You son of a bitch!
[04:09.02]It was... People surrounded me!
[04:13.18]Get tomahawked!
[04:13.94]I don't even know if I'm winning or not.
[04:17.66]Am I?
[04:17.98]Apparently I'm winning.
[04:20.83]Jeez, there's a lot of human beings over here.
[04:26.17]Oh...
[04:28.86]I would have had that kill too.
[04:30.68]Bastard.
[04:35.88]Damn it!
[04:37.44]Should have paid more attention.
[04:40.64]Come on, come on, come on.
[04:43.96]Oh, hit him with that!
[04:49.54]You're just gonna get stabbed.
[04:52.49]What?
[04:52.79]What?
[04:53.73]Alright, that works too.
[04:55.87]Seven seconds!
[04:57.75]Six, five, four, three, two, one.
[05:00.83]Oh, is that it?
[05:03.63]Hey, I won fruit snacks, baby.
[05:07.05]That was crazy.
[05:08.67]That was absolutely crazy.
[05:11.93]But let's do one more.
[05:13.13]Let's do another one.
[05:14.89]Let's get off this boat level.
[05:17.55]Connection interrupted.
[05:18.42]What the hell?
[05:25.70]Bang.
[05:28.63]I have some delivery for you.
[05:31.17]Extra special package.
[05:32.37]I don't want to run into these.
[05:36.54]I love these things, man.
[05:37.42]I don't want to run out of them.
[05:40.92]Bankrupt.
[05:44.08]Bankrupt.
[05:47.16]I'll just run around with these damn things.
[05:51.92]Wow.
[05:52.52]Wow.
[05:52.92]Wow.
[05:54.68]Wow.
[05:55.27]Wow.
[05:55.49]He's still behind me.
[06:01.71]Holy crap.
[06:02.63]Just... Whoa.
[06:05.37]What, did he shoot me in the face?
[06:06.37]What the hell was that?
[06:11.40]It's all good.
[06:11.96]Let's come out here and do it again.
[06:20.51]I'm gonna stab you in your face.
[06:23.81]You're gonna get stabbed right in your face.
[06:27.19]I'm gonna stab...
[06:29.78]I'm gonna stab.
[06:32.51]You're gonna get freaking... Where's this guy?
[06:37.77]Oh, he's over here.
[06:41.31]Get him!
[06:43.11]No!
[06:43.63]No, watch it.
[06:44.39]Please don't hurt me.
[06:45.11]Please don't kill me.
[06:46.78]Jeez Louise, with a piece of cheese.
[06:50.10]Oh, that guy's alive.
[06:50.82]That guy's dead, I mean.
[06:53.14]Chaos!
[06:54.28]There's another guy!
[06:56.13]Did I get him?
[06:58.33]Oh my god.
[07:00.29]Run.
[07:02.43]Oh, did I get... I didn't get anybody.
[07:05.13]Damn it.
[07:08.03]At least I got the tomahawk.
[07:13.30]Wow.
[07:14.18]Somebody behind me trying to kill me.
[07:17.04]How did that not work?
[07:20.00]Who did... Who did... Who did I just kill?
[07:26.73]Apparently one of them got killed.
[07:30.81]Keep running.
[07:31.61]Keep moving.
[07:34.25]Keep moving.
[07:36.11]Keep moving.
[07:38.04]What?
[07:38.34]No!
[07:38.40]No!
[07:38.66]What do we got?
[07:42.92]I'm winning?
[07:43.42]Well, I was winning.
[07:48.72]Skewered.
[07:56.43]I'm so scared.
[07:57.27]Let's try using this thing again.
[07:59.68]At least for a minute or two.
[08:03.14]Or three.
[08:04.94]Or... Sticks and stones will break my bones.
[08:10.14]But words will never hurt me.
[08:13.26]What the... Some dude was just like up my ass.
[08:17.80]Maybe not.
[08:18.26]Where the hell was that guy?
[08:19.70]That was weird.
[08:24.44]Sticks and stones...
[08:27.02]Sticks and stones.
[08:32.12]Damn.
[08:33.94]Right here.
[08:34.28]This guy right here.
[08:39.91]Ow.
[08:40.79]I'm losing.
[08:41.39]I gotta pull this together here.
[08:43.37]Come on.
[08:44.55]Come on.
[08:44.77]Pull it together.
[08:46.73]You laggy son of a bitch.
[08:49.17]Come here.
[08:53.21]Come here.
[08:55.53]Come on, keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.
[08:59.05]Keep it going, keep it going.
[09:03.30]Still losing.
[09:06.38]Still losing, but can I pull it through?
[09:10.50]I, wow, how in the name of Jehoshaphat did I not kill that guy?
[09:18.10]I was sticking the knife in the back of his head.
[09:20.94]Nothing happened.
[09:23.57]You know what, screw it, Tomahawk.
[09:29.61]Explosions.
[09:30.99]Anybody over here?
[09:32.39]Yeah, there it is.
[09:34.71]Take down that guy.
[09:37.73]No idea where I am.
[09:39.05]I'm like freaking Superman.
[09:41.78]It's tied.
[09:42.26]It's tied.
[09:42.70]I gotta pull out.
[09:43.24]I gotta pull ahead.
[09:46.46]No!
[09:47.52]No!
[09:48.62]No!
[09:50.10]No, I gotta pull ahead.
[09:51.36]I only have a few seconds.
[09:55.27]No!
[09:58.03]I gotta get this guy.
[09:58.89]Gotta get him.
[09:59.87]What?
[10:00.69]What?
[10:01.35]What was that?
[10:03.41]The guy just like... Really, bro?
[10:06.27]You're gonna drop shot in sticks and stones?
[10:10.18]Oh my god.
[10:11.32]I won!
[10:15.26]I actually won.
[10:16.76]Well, there you go.
[10:17.36]Nice.
[10:20.14]I didn't get the last kill, though.
[10:22.18]But yeah, that's going to wrap it up, I guess, guys.
[10:23.82]So thank you so much for watching.
[10:25.29]Really do appreciate it.
[10:26.47]Sticks and stones, baby.
[10:28.15]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[10:29.83]And of course, take care, everybody.
