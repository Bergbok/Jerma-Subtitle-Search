[00:00.05]Nobody cares about the intro.
[00:01.35]I got a pretty funny clip here with the direct hit at least I thought it was funny where I'm just shooting around blasting some people I hit this engineer and up in the air right through the window like what are the chances that's pretty funny but I feel like it needs something else to be like you know really good so I'm just gonna edit something really quickly
[00:29.75]No.
[00:30.29]No, that wasn't worth an hour of my time.
[00:32.49]What is that?
[00:34.04]What am I doing?
[00:34.94]I don't know.
[00:35.72]I have a much better idea I'm going to use.
[00:41.81]Here we go.
[00:42.33]Crate number one.
[00:43.53]What are we going to get?
[00:44.91]It's on crating the loot.
[00:46.53]What am I going to get?
[00:48.13]I'm going to get a hat.
[00:50.00]Oh, it's a pirate bandana.
[00:51.94]I could have bought one in real life.
[00:53.32]Let's go with the next crate.
[00:55.06]What am I gonna get?
[00:57.04]Am I gonna get a hat?
[00:58.68]What am I gonna get?
[01:00.47]It's a little beat boy.
[01:02.39]I could have bought a real game Nintendo.
[01:05.93]I'm opening up the next crate.
[01:07.93]What am I gonna get?
[01:09.71]What am I gonna get?
[01:11.39]It's the Air Raider.
[01:12.59]It makes the Pyro look like he's... What am I gonna get in this next crate?
[01:16.77]What am I gonna get?
[01:17.82]I'm creating your loot.
[01:19.02]Why does it start at 5?
[01:19.86]It could start at 3, just as easy.
[01:22.22]Oh, it makes the Spy look like he's... Yeah, okay.
[01:27.56]Open up the next crate.
[01:29.12]What am I gonna get?
[01:30.88]What's in this next crate?
[01:32.72]I wonder what I'm gonna...
[01:34.76]Oh, it's like glasses.
[01:36.56]It's like two rectangular slits on the engineer's eyes.
[01:39.62]That must have taken a long time to make.
[01:41.06]I need red.
[01:42.56]Red.
[01:43.72]Red.
[01:44.16]Red.
[01:44.76]Done.
[01:45.58]What's the next crate?
[01:46.84]What am I gonna get?
[01:48.45]I wonder what's this?
[01:49.37]It's the final crate.
[01:50.45]If this isn't an unusual, I'm gonna throw my new headset.
[01:53.83]It's a beard!
[01:57.29]Did you honestly just do that?
[02:01.29]So that's the video.
