[00:16.74]We are moving on.
[00:17.36]It's always fun to play with Vinny.
[00:19.56]Good to see Vinny again.
[00:23.36]We are going to play a couple more horror games.
[00:28.34]And this one is apparently a doozy from what I've been told.
[00:34.21]This is at dead of night.
[00:37.65]This apparently has really, really bad scares.
[00:40.37]And I'm, you know me.
[00:45.04]There's no settings in this game.
[00:46.94]So I imagine just FMV.
[00:53.27]We'll find out right now, won't we?
[00:54.77]I need to change the game because title can be the same.
[01:02.61]At dead of night.
[01:09.43]Okay.
[01:12.79]Alright, coming back.
[01:15.01]Let's see if you can see me, which I think you should be able to.
[01:17.95]Not quite.
[01:30.75]There we are.
[01:31.23]There's that.
[01:33.91]and then here am I okay um I can't really turn lights off because it's still day here it doesn't work turn this on I don't know how loud this game is but it's apparently I would imagine it's probably very loud let's find out okay q and w is audio loudness
[02:02.02]Uh, I should probably watch the tour.
[02:03.36]Okay, I'm gonna watch let's watch the intro Is that too loud Watch full tutorial watch the what should I do?
[02:18.08]Do it louder this is loud man, just making sure you understand that Um, should I just watch the tutorial
[02:32.46]Way too loud.
[02:35.48]I- What the f- It's at zero!
[02:37.64]Hold on.
[02:49.51]Okay.
[02:49.77]You have to stop her.
[02:57.27]The chase.
[03:04.89]He hides whenever he can.
[03:14.96]Oh my God, this is gonna suck.
[03:19.72]I'm not looking forward to this.
[03:21.42]He can't hide on the stairs or on the ground floor.
[03:26.86]Or in the basement, so OK.
[03:31.56]What's my strategy?
[03:38.86]Move out of line of sight if he sees you.
[03:46.74]Any unlocked room you can hide.
[03:47.90]If he comes in... Just, okay, so hide in the bathroom.
[04:00.75]Hide, okay.
[04:04.05]Use the spyglass?
[04:13.47]You can call out.
[04:23.08]Of course, the game where the monster or the bad person is chasing you, lock him in.
[04:30.18]Alright, I forgot everything.
[04:46.12]Is it spoilers?
[04:49.66]Spoilers, idiot!
[04:53.66]It's the tutorial of the game!
[04:56.84]It's the game's tutorial!
[04:58.89]Heck, what do you mean spoilers?
[05:00.19]Okay, alright.
[05:02.61]So let's watch the prologue.
[05:05.65]Here we go. ...
[05:28.82]2 FPS Andy?
[05:29.88]Why am I at 2 FPS Andy?
[05:35.18]Hello?
[05:36.04]Maya, it's Hamlet.
[05:54.04]Why are all FNB games British?
[05:56.16]Are they?
[06:29.61]Yeah, how come the FPS are bad?
[06:31.63]There's no video settings I could do.
[06:34.70]I'm not dropping frames.
[06:35.58]I don't know.
[06:36.38]Ah, Maya, I presume.
[06:39.02]Don't be alarmed.
[06:40.82]Your friends booked you in.
[06:42.36]Let me just check.
[06:45.92]Ah, yes.
[06:47.14]Room 101.
[06:48.30]It's all been paid for, so you don't have to worry about anything.
[06:51.26]You have very nice friends.
[06:53.90]Very nice.
[06:55.36]And there's quite a few of you I see as well.
[07:00.32]Nice to see so many fresh young faces for a change.
[07:07.75]You're here for the music festival in town, I presume?
[07:11.37]Yeah, we were supposed to be camping there tonight.
[07:13.65]Somebody said, why is she not talking?
[07:16.29]She is now.
[07:20.11]Will you be staying for breakfast?
[07:21.92]I don't think so.
[07:22.88]We'll probably just get going.
[07:24.24]That's fine.
[07:25.45]And if you don't mind me asking, Maya, would you be interested in the entertainment tonight?
[07:32.03]Tonight?
[07:32.43]It starts around midnight, usually.
[07:35.98]It's me doing it, actually.
[07:38.66]Comedy.
[07:39.24]Ooh, okay.
[07:40.12]I do this comedy character called Hugo Punch.
[07:45.06]He's sort of this comedic sociopath.
[07:48.88]Says things that you're not supposed to say and that sort of thing.
[07:53.19]It's quite popular with students.
[07:56.56]I don't think so.
[07:57.48]That's not me.
[07:57.96]We're all just going to bed, I think.
[07:59.54]This is really familiar.
[08:00.84]Oh, stop it.
[08:01.41]Twist your arm on this.
[08:03.57]It's okay.
[08:04.21]I'd rather just go to bed.
[08:06.17]Sorry.
[08:07.69]Fine.
[08:08.35]Fine.
[08:08.93]Fine.
[08:09.71]Which way are the rooms?
[08:12.05]Just take the lift.
[08:13.31]You're on the first floor.
[08:14.43]Okay, thanks.
[08:15.01]Oh, shit.
[08:15.25]Wait a minute.
[08:15.69]It is midnight in England right now.
[08:17.75]Drop your key off in the box, if you will, Maya, please, tomorrow.
[08:22.20]It's midnight in England right now.
[08:28.53]Best show in town and no takers.
[08:34.29]Who needs proper entertainment when you've got YouTube and My Face or whatever?
[08:41.06]Stupid, uncultured.
[08:46.50]Why is it running like this?
[08:49.48]Don't start this again.
[08:50.80]I feel like the menu was doing this, but when I, I don't know.
[08:55.06]I don't want to hear it, okay?
[08:57.18]Not tonight.
[08:59.60]Go to the settings.
[09:00.50]There aren't any settings.
[09:01.20]Uh-oh.
[09:01.44]Wait, it's being captured?
[09:15.81]I don't think so.
[09:30.29]Bad eggs need cracking.
[09:31.73]Whack them hard and crack their shell.
[09:33.50]Kick them down the stairs to hell.
[09:36.86]You know what you need to do, Jimmy.
[09:39.78]Show them who's boss.
[09:42.92]That's the way to do it.
[09:44.32]Why is it running?
[09:49.36]Okay.
[09:53.62]I want to fix this.
[10:07.64]What the fuck is going on?
[10:09.98]Disable G-Sync.
[10:11.00]I don't think I've ever turned... Press Alt-Enter.
[10:38.16]We'll toggle full screen.
[10:42.29]I think it is in full screen.
[10:44.89]We'll see if I actually start playing and see what happens.
[10:57.37]Breaking bad intro.
[10:59.70]It actually is.
[11:01.90]I think it's the same sound.
[11:03.46]It's the same drum beat.
[11:14.87]Alright.
[11:18.93]If I hit escape, is it gonna... Can I maybe... I don't know.
[11:26.84]Seaview Hotel has a dark past.
[11:33.80]Its ghosts have a story to tell.
[11:36.04]Find them.
[11:40.71]Use the ghost and spirit receiver to talk to them.
[11:47.38]They'll tell you Jimmy's secrets.
[11:51.67]Jimmy!
[11:53.17]Jimmy!
[12:02.13]Okay.
[12:03.93]Let me see if the FPS is still bad.
[12:08.93]It's back to normal now.
[12:09.75]Okay.
[12:10.06]So, alright.
[12:10.48]Start new game.
[12:15.10]The story of Jimmy Hall.
[12:18.11]Okay.
[12:18.87]Choose standard game or extreme game.
[12:21.13]When playing the extreme game, if Jimmy attacks you, he will take almost everything every time.
[12:25.83]Your current game will be lost when you begin a new one and your achievements will be... Oh, we're just doing standard.
[12:29.65]We're just doing extreme.
[12:32.71]Oh, we're going.
[12:34.65]We're going.
[12:36.65]This is the device you found.
[12:37.73]Select this to switch it on.
[12:41.91]It can detect spirits' voices if you're near enough to them.
[12:44.99]They're going to turn it up a little.
[12:49.04]Okay.
[12:49.24]If you haven't seen it, go to the main menu and watch the tutorial.
[12:52.70]Okay.
[12:55.30]Oh, yeah.
[12:56.88]This game hates my computer.
[13:04.83]What should I do?
[13:09.45]Is it weird?
[13:09.93]Yeah.
[13:12.23]GPU settings enable or disable G-Sync.
[13:17.03]Um.
[13:20.73]Restart it.
[13:21.29]It looks fine.
[13:21.87]It looks fine in the menu here.
[13:23.03]Yeah, it's when I'm in the actual game.
[13:28.15]It's in the NVIDIA control panel.
[13:29.79]Okay, NVIDIA control panel.

[13:53.72]The G-Sync can call... Alright, so I'm gonna turn... I'm turning off G-Sync.
[14:00.97]Windows G is enable.
[14:03.25]I don't think I have that set up.
[14:04.11]Windows G enable.
[14:05.79]What?
[14:07.43]Windows G?
[14:08.37]Is this for real?
[14:09.59]Don't fuck with me.
[14:10.09]Is this for real?
[14:10.51]Is it gonna crash my computer?
[14:14.77]That's a meme.
[14:15.45]God damn it.

[14:32.69]It's in Windows settings.
[14:38.37]Why do I need to- okay.

[24:50.49]Remove the motion blur.
[24:52.53]Guys, there are no video settings in this game.
[24:58.67]I think it's supposed to hide.
[24:59.47]Should I try that way?
[25:16.21]No, it's locked.
[25:23.89]Why is this locked too?
[25:28.21]First floor?

[27:57.81]What should I do about this?
[27:58.71]Is someone there?
[28:04.36]Near the lockers?
[28:09.30]No, softer.
[28:10.44]Is someone there?
[28:11.00]I don't think I can do anything here.
[28:21.83]Need to get the compass and the mirror.
[28:25.79]Yeah, I don't... The game did not say, hey, you need to get the compass and the mirror.
[28:29.57]By the way, they're in 104 and in the garage.
[28:40.77]It did.
[28:42.73]Yes, it did.
[28:43.09]What are you talking about?
[28:47.39]It did?
[28:48.73]The game said to get them.
[28:49.77]It didn't say where they were.
[29:03.69]Huh?
[29:10.26]You need to find a compass and scrying mirror.
[29:12.76]It doesn't say where it is.
[29:13.92]I'm going to go to my room.
[29:16.24]My room is 101.
[29:25.95]I'm going to 101. 101.
[29:46.46]Don't go that fucking far.
[29:48.32]106.
[29:54.73]Let's just go in here.
[30:09.19]Found some childish, violent drawings.
[30:15.10]Okay.
[30:38.12]Is anyone there?
[30:44.64]Nothing in here.
[30:52.26]No.
[30:53.64]Why is the music getting louder?
[30:54.98]I know, but I don't know where it is.
[30:56.50]Gotta go to 101.
[31:04.05]I'm so concerned he's gonna be here.
[31:09.01]It's so quiet.
[31:18.12]Where's 101?
[31:19.00]107.
[31:24.04]I'm in the wrong fucking way.
[31:25.03]101.
[31:25.05]108.
[31:25.07]Fuck.
[31:27.61]Alright, I'm just going in here.
[31:47.37]Oh, hurry up!
[31:56.86]He's looking for me right now.
[33:11.71]Where is he?
[33:18.51]What?
[33:18.79]OK, I went through it.
[33:19.57]Check these.
[33:20.65]This one doesn't work.
[33:22.53]Oh my fucking God.
[33:25.04]Oh, that's very bad.
[33:41.19]Dude, I got a sword.
[33:42.19]Alright, can I hit him with the sword?
[33:44.23]Is anyone there?
[33:54.70]I have all this shit and I can't talk to anybody.
[33:57.51]Is anyone there?
[34:04.41]He's down the hall somewhere.
[34:20.49]You found everything but the compass.
[34:22.11]Oh, I don't know where it is.
[34:47.41]I have to get to 101.
[34:47.93]Oh, fuck.
[34:50.97]I went the wrong way.
[34:51.97]107.
[34:53.49]Alright. 106.
[35:22.45]Dude, where the fuck is 101?
[35:29.00]101!
[35:29.24]Let's go, let's go.
[35:29.90]Alright, I'm in.
[35:33.98]Lock the door.
[35:39.14]Alright, what's in here?
[35:42.07]This is my stuff.
[35:42.73]Alright.
[35:45.05]Key.
[35:49.93]Bottle of turpentine and a lighter.
[35:54.41]You found a chef's nap.
[36:03.88]Is someone there?
[36:07.52]I found every single item in the game besides the one I need.
[36:38.48]That sounds far away.
[36:39.24]I'm just gonna try to get to the elevator.
[36:41.40]What do you say?
[36:45.66]I got really high la- I got really high and went to sleep last night and had a dream.
[36:49.46]I didn't- Alright, hold on.
[36:55.85]At one point, Jerma was stealing a spaceship.
[36:58.57]As he flies around, he just makes some insane, incoherent noises.
[37:02.15]Um... Oh, speaking of being high.
[37:04.52]So, Holly and I were high the other night.
[37:07.46]And... You're gonna laugh.
[37:09.58]So, Holly and I are high.
[37:11.10]We're, you know, whatever.
[37:11.92]We're just doing a little bit of recreational marijuana.
[37:14.32]Whatever.
[37:14.56]Uh, and... We started... We started getting really, really high.
[37:20.68]So, it's like, alright, fuck, man.
[37:23.54]We need a palate cleanser.
[37:25.38]Because, like, we were on YouTube, and it was like we were watching videos and shit, and it was like, okay, we need some kind of palate cleanser, so we went to this video specifically titled, it was called Cute Animals for When You Are Stressed.
[37:39.76]Cute Animals for When You Are Stressed.
[37:41.74]It's like, okay, let's put that on.
[37:44.16]There was a pre-roll ad on this video, and it went exactly like this.
[37:50.55]Crime is skyrocketing.
[37:53.41]Your, your life could potentially be changed dramatically in the future.
[37:58.59]That's why you need to vote.
[37:59.67]It was a political ad.
[38:01.67]Talking about how crime was skyrocketing.
[38:03.60]We're gonna go to like a dystopian future and we were just sitting there like, What's happening?
[38:09.70]Crime is skyrocketing, honey.
[38:11.20]Did you know that?
[38:13.30]It was fucked.
[38:16.61]It caused way more stress.
[38:23.21]Anyways, let's keep going.
[38:43.54]Okay, I need to get back to the elevator?
[38:46.92]And go to the basement again?
[38:53.07]I can't open that.
[38:53.97]Go back.
[39:04.18]Check every single room.
[39:05.60]Did we go in 107?
[39:11.30]Uh-oh.
[39:21.13]I've given up trying to help.
[39:25.66]I'm sorry if I look over here and this 10,000 messages a second.
[39:31.10]I'm sorry I can't read what you said.
[39:32.54]Okay, I didn't look in here yet.
[39:57.72]There's nothing in here.
[40:16.93]Did I go in 109?
[40:18.47]I did- No, I've been in here.
[40:19.45]I've been- I've been in pretty much- I gotta go to the other side.
[40:21.37]Yeah, this is where the- this is where the, uh, the sword was.
[40:25.21]I have to go to, like, 1- Like, 12 to, like, 1- 15 or something, right?
[40:38.08]Because I can't open these with this key.
[40:40.40]So I have to go to the other side.
[40:41.54]What was that?
[40:44.32]Okay, that's me running.
[40:48.65]I did 107.
[40:56.14]Did I go over here?
[40:57.08]It's OK, 112.
[40:59.20]There's nothing in here.
[41:08.42]I have a storage unit or something here.
[41:12.29]There you go, OK.
[41:15.43]I found the compass finally.
[41:22.27]You told me to go to the basement.
[41:23.41]Yeah, how?
[41:27.21]Okay.
[41:35.68]Okay, I'm making progress.
[41:38.24]You need to find a scrying mirror.
[41:39.96]I bet it's down here.
[41:50.02]Where's this compass?
[41:53.85]How do I, uh, how can I pick up the compass?
[41:55.87]Alright, I'm going to keep going down this way because there's other... I'm going to go right across, open up that one.
[42:02.76]This will point towards spirits.
[42:10.90]It's too dark.
[42:17.60]I get a flashlight, I guess, eventually, probably, right?
[42:27.64]I'm 14.
[42:29.78]Too dark.
[42:42.15]Scrying mirror.
[42:45.25]Come on.
[42:47.70]Trophies and awards.
[42:49.92]That's not a scrying mirror.
[43:00.78]Turn the lights off, dude.
[43:01.48]This isn't even scary.
[43:02.74]It's the middle of the day.
[43:04.18]Uh-oh.
[43:37.24]This is open.
[43:47.13]Jesus.
[43:47.81]Okay, I don't think there's anything I can do here.
[44:10.67]Oh, wooden paddle and another key.
[44:18.93]Where is this mirror?
[44:20.71]Wait, can I look in there?
[44:22.77]No.
[45:04.04]It's pointing this way.
[45:16.56]What's going on?
[45:17.04]Why is someone behind me?
[45:19.30]He's literally behind me right now.
[45:23.76]Oh, fuck.
[45:24.38]Get in here.
[45:24.72]He doesn't actually come in here, right?
[45:33.91]I just scratched my nose.
[45:48.99]Huh?
[45:50.73]Wait, lock the door?
[45:51.71]Old suitcases.
[46:24.29]I'm gonna go down.
[46:26.53]I feel like he's right here.
[46:51.35]Where are you?
[46:52.59]Oh my god.
[46:57.02]Alright, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[47:00.26]Elevator, elevator, elevator.
[47:01.40]Right here.
[47:02.12]Go.
[47:02.56]Down.
[47:03.58]Quickly, please.
[47:04.44]Okay.
[47:04.90]Go on.
[47:05.26]Hurry.
[47:05.58]Please.
[47:05.80]Garage door.
[47:13.27]Alright, I'm good.
[47:18.64]I haven't looked down here.
[47:41.12]They're going like the back office.
[47:43.40]He's not here.
[47:50.20]No, I can't do anything in here.
[47:54.53]I don't know where the fuck I'm going, but I'm going...
[48:23.77]Can I not interact with anything in here?
[48:43.25]Jesus.
[48:43.67]Okay.
[48:46.63]I guess I'm going to go down again.
[48:56.66]Ghostless run.
[49:02.32]Lower ground.
[49:05.54]I'm going to complete the game without seeing him once.
[49:19.45]I was already down here.
[49:23.11]Remember?
[49:23.47]I already did this.
[49:27.75]It was that little girl down here.
[49:29.75]I can talk to the spirit now?
[49:44.75]I don't think so.
[49:50.21]Mm-mm.
[49:59.90]Hello.
[50:00.36]Who are you?
[50:06.25]Amy Bell.
[50:08.39]I'm 10.
[50:11.97]Okay.
[50:15.81]Um.
[50:20.18]Is that you?
[50:35.07]hey who drew those violent pictures okay who wrote the note that says goodbye
[50:53.70]Okay.
[50:53.94]What do you know about the sword?
[50:56.48]Okay.
[50:56.68]Okay.
[51:19.11]What is turpentine?
[51:20.00]I found a bottle of turpentine in a lighter.
[51:23.32]What were they for?
[51:24.16]I don't know what that is.
[51:25.28]I'm 10.
[51:25.64]I didn't know what they were until Jimmy showed me.
[51:33.98]Who did the chef's hat belong to?
[51:36.22]I don't know.
[51:40.13]Who were the whiskey bottles?
[51:41.09]Why was there a collection of whiskey bottles in one of the rooms?
[51:51.06]Okay, yep.
[51:52.74]Okay.
[51:53.80]I found some trophies.
[51:55.46]Who won them?
[51:58.89]I don't know.
[51:59.93]I don't know.
[52:01.07]Where did the wooden paddle come from?
[52:02.59]I don't know.
[52:10.75]I saw some suitcases in a chest.
[52:13.64]Who did they belong to?
[52:19.01]I don't know.
[52:19.77]Okay.
[52:22.12]So, we've learned... Absolutely nothing.
[52:33.28]All we learned... What?
[52:34.78]Okay.
[52:43.73]Okay.
[52:50.26]Alright, where is this mirror?
[52:56.79]I need the mirror.
[52:59.69]I don't know where the fuck it is.
[53:02.23]It's not down here.
[53:03.03]I missed a few rooms.
[53:09.38]Third floor.
[53:14.04]Ground floor.
[53:14.74]I feel like I didn't explore everything.
[53:19.25]We learned that Jimmy was a fucked up boy who had a sword and turpentine.
[53:22.41]Yeah.
[53:24.74]Ground floor.
[53:27.80]I've seen a lot of G's.
[53:29.40]You can backseat.
[53:30.32]This game's... It's one of those games where you need to kind of know what you're doing.
[53:36.14]I don't mind it.
[53:45.89]Ground floor.
[54:01.42]I already went down here.
[54:02.50]Alright, where are the rooms on the ground floor?
[54:13.35]No help.
[54:14.03]No help.
[54:17.33]The compass will bring you to the mirror.
[54:20.09]You have a key for floor one stairs.
[54:22.43]I do?
[54:24.21]I do?
[54:30.36]Alright, let's go to 1.
[54:32.66]Where did I not go in 1, though?
[54:34.12]I feel like I opened everything.
[54:35.00]I feel like I went in 107.
[54:41.68]You did.
[55:15.33]This one here?
[55:18.00]Where's it pointing?
[55:19.60]Where's this compass pointing?
[55:23.32]Dude, this compass is pointing in such... What is this?
[55:25.52]Where's it pointing?
[55:35.17]This compass is just going in a circle.
[55:45.75]What's this?
[55:47.56]Store room.
[55:48.92]It's pointing nowhere because it's in another floor.
[55:52.75]Oh.
[56:15.14]102 to 105.
[56:46.23]121.
[56:46.37]Uh-oh.
[56:46.93]122.
[56:46.95]123.
[56:48.25]None of these are probably going to work.
[56:57.80]This one does.
[56:58.42]Alright.
[56:58.62]123.
[56:58.64]Give me the mirror.
[56:59.40]Dang.
[57:07.88]Ugh.
[57:16.16]I thought it was a mirror.
[57:23.78]I'm going to go straight across to 122.
[57:46.91]What?
[57:47.39]Wait, I have a... There's more than one compass?
[57:52.45]You found a syringe?
[57:56.73]Oh, fuck.
[57:57.35]Okay.
[57:57.65]Alright.
[57:57.91]Alright.
[57:58.13]Alright.
[57:58.33]Alright.
[57:58.53]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[57:59.27]Hide, hide, hide, hide.
[57:59.71]I've never seen it.
[58:00.11]I don't even know what the guy does.
[58:01.05]I don't even know what he does.
[58:14.68]I found every other item in the whole game.
[58:23.07]He's on the floor.
[58:24.17]He's on your floor, but you're safe.
[58:25.21]Alright.
[58:30.97]What am I?
[58:31.29]I have to go to like 102 to 105.
[58:47.09]I don't even know how to get there from here.
[58:50.21]I think I'm just going to go for it.
[58:52.39]Right.
[59:31.36]Holy shit, no way.
[59:33.90]What?
[59:40.43]Get out of here!
[59:41.95]Why can he not see me?
[60:03.02]Did he leave the room?
[60:03.94]Holy God, this guy sucks.
[60:38.32]This guy sucks.
[60:40.80]He heard me say that.
[60:42.92]He heard me say that.
[60:47.00]Jesus.
[60:48.78]What did that say?
[60:49.44]What happened?
[60:51.94]Look.
[60:53.52]My whole body hurts.
[60:54.50]I heard the door close, but that was not the front door closing.
[60:58.44]That was the bathroom door closing.
[61:03.28]My shoulder hurts.
[61:05.38]Oh my god.
[61:08.46]I just, there was no, there was no road in my brain that led to that guy was still in the room.
[61:15.71]He takes things.
[61:18.03]Oh, he took my, um, radio.
[61:21.73]Alright.
[61:22.47]So it said, look, there was a thing that popped up.
[61:24.41]What did it say?
[61:28.45]Look in the first floor near the stairs.
[61:30.03]Okay.
[61:39.20]Where am I?
[61:40.46]Oh, I'm at 107.
[61:43.18]I need to get to one... No, other way.
[61:54.45]I need like 102.
[61:55.53]108.
[61:58.95]Look in the first floor store near the stairs.
[62:07.59]I need like 102.
[62:18.34]Is it right here?
[62:24.06]Why is it so dark?
[62:42.05]Where are you?
[62:44.44]Did I get so turned around? 106.
[63:04.08]That's not it.
[63:21.10]No!
[63:30.77]Oh my God.
[63:31.45]Okay.
[63:31.89]Can I run?
[63:32.47]What if I just run?
[63:37.54]Is he doing that on purpose?
[63:38.17]He's fucking me on purpose.
[63:40.33]He's fucking me on purpose.
[63:41.33]Should I talk shit?
[63:43.90]He's fucking me on purpose.
[63:46.02]I'm gonna scream.
[63:48.02]I can't... I can't lock the door.
[64:03.31]I think I have to go this way.
[64:05.21]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[64:06.92]One, two, three.
[64:08.24]Okay, I need... Is he behind me?
[64:42.42]Come on bathroom What are you doing?
[65:04.65]He's right here
[65:12.26]And I'm sorry.
[65:12.82]I have a lot of trouble with hotels.
[65:16.96]And maybe some of you can relate to this.
[65:18.80]It doesn't matter how many times I go to my hotel room.
[65:23.23]When I come off the elevator, I have no fucking idea where I'm going.
[65:27.43]Is it left, right?
[65:28.93]I don't... Okay, no, there is 102 to like 110.
[65:32.63]Okay, I have to go that way.
[65:36.41]I just... I'm not going to be able to find my way around here.
[65:46.09]He's right outside the door.
[65:47.93]I can't leave right now.
[65:48.83]Should I just go for it?
[66:17.62]I'm gonna go back up to three.
[66:25.37]Should I go to three?
[66:26.21]I just don't... I don't know.
[66:27.63]I don't know, dude.
[66:29.54]I'm going.
[66:37.15]Which way is he?
[66:48.61]106.
[66:48.69]Dude.
[66:52.98]Oh my god.
[66:53.94]Oh my god.
[66:56.08]Oh my god.
[66:56.90]Hide somewhere.
[66:59.11]Right now.
[67:00.63]Not here.
[67:01.17]Oh, I'm dead.
[67:02.91]I'm fucking dead.
[67:15.68]I just don't know even how I... There's no signs.
[67:20.18]Like I'm walking around a casino floor.
[67:21.76]Like I just don't even know what direction I need to go in.
[67:23.34]There's no signs.
[67:24.00]There's one sign in front of the elevator.
[67:25.54]That's it.
[67:45.15]108?
[67:45.75]Did I go in 108?
[67:53.78]109?
[67:56.15]I went in here, I think, but he's coming.
[68:00.89]This is where the sword is.
[68:01.77]Okay, dude.
[68:11.56]Dude, I can't think of a worse thing that I could be doing than try to find your way around a hotel room.
[68:15.98]Like a hotel.
[68:18.25]You got three floors of this shit?
[68:27.29]Every hallway is the same hallway in my brain.
[68:29.31]It just is.
[68:36.59]I can't open these.
[68:42.83]I'm gonna try to go up to three.
[68:46.57]And where is the storeroom that's apparently near the elevator?
[68:53.86]All this shit looks the same!
[68:55.16]Alright.
[68:59.98]What are you doing?
[69:00.68]I just went down the same fucking hallway.
[69:12.71]It's literally concrete all over again.
[69:16.99]I'm better off just using the sword and swinging at the guy.
[69:19.09]Seriously.
[69:25.17]You've been in the same three halls over and over again.
[69:28.01]I can't navigate this in real life, let alone in a video game, where somebody's chasing me with a baseball bat.
[69:40.04]Go down the stairs.
[69:40.64]The stairs were locked last time.
[69:57.76]Like, where?
[69:58.18]I gotta... I keep, like, going in a circle.
[70:03.09]This is one... Alright.
[70:04.29]Where the fuck am I going?
[70:08.63]This is one... I haven't gone on 114.
[70:10.29]It's fucking dark.
[70:11.95]Never mind.
[70:14.24]Ask for directions.
[70:17.14]Dude, I... I'm being honest.
[70:19.02]I have no idea where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[70:21.68]Every single room is the same room.
[70:22.94]Every hallway is the same hallway.
[70:34.83]Is this it right here?
[70:35.47]It's the storeroom, right?
[70:41.57]It's not in this one.
[70:42.25]I'm nineteen.
[70:59.12]Where the fuck is he?
[71:03.30]I don't know which way to go.
[71:06.38]118.
[71:06.42]I just have to go in a room.
[71:07.42]I have to go in something.
[71:08.52]Whatever.
[71:10.78]Go.
[71:11.18]Run to the exit sign.
[71:11.98]I'm done.
[71:22.10]I'm done.
[71:31.51]Jesus.
[71:32.05]Get out of here.
[71:44.12]I'm going not- I'm not going anywhere.
[71:45.70]He's probably just sitting here, like last time.
[72:11.39]See, this shit happens, and then I come out here and my brain has reset.
[72:15.72]It's like, oh, this is just another nondescript hotel hallway again.
[72:27.34]What?
[72:27.54]Here we are.
[72:28.34]Nondescript hotel hallway.
[72:35.04]There's no map, like, I don't know where the fuck to go.
[72:37.58]If I had, if I could press M and see where the fuck I was supposed to go.
[72:45.72]I'm just running around till I find the fucking elevator.
[72:47.95]I'll just outrun him.
[72:48.53]121.
[72:51.31]122.
[72:51.33]123.
[72:51.39]Fuck you.
[72:51.77]This game sucks.
[72:54.87]I'm done.
[72:56.23]This game sucks.
[73:04.20]This game sucks.
[73:06.78]I hate this game.
[73:07.54]It's stupid.
[73:08.34]I'm done.
[73:19.12]Uh-huh.
[73:36.56]Alright.
[73:37.28]What now?
[73:37.82]What else did you take?
[73:39.66]Can I please find a way to get to the fucking elevator?
[73:45.24]It's not even the fucking scary bad guy that's the problem for me.
[73:48.04]It's walking in a circle in a non-descript hotel room!
[73:59.89]107.
[74:00.01]Alright.
[74:00.73]Where do I go?
[74:01.63]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[74:07.51]Not this way.
[74:08.25]Alright.
[74:08.51]What about the other way?
[74:15.88]108.
[74:20.20]How did I end up here again?
[74:23.37]Where's the one hallway that leads back to the fucking lobby?
[74:51.56]Where is the fucking elevator?
[74:55.75]Where's the exit signs?
[74:57.63]I'm gonna fucking Alt-F for this game.
[75:17.77]YAY!
[75:18.55]I'm out of it!
[75:19.59]Oh my god, why did this take me so fucking long?
[75:22.07]Alright, where is the storeroom?
[75:30.48]They just looked on the security camera.
[75:32.10]A guy just going in the same circle.
[75:45.00]Give me this fucking thing back.
[75:59.28]Okay.
[76:00.48]Now we get to play the game called... Go try to find where the fucking scrying mirror is.
[76:12.13]I'm going to third floor.
[76:12.99]101 to 115 is that way.
[76:18.79]Good luck.
[76:19.17]I'm gonna get lost.
[76:19.95]101 to 115.
[76:23.65]Okay.
[76:24.05]Okay.
[76:33.66]Okay, so where's 101?
[76:34.98]It's this way, right?
[76:38.54]I need to remember this thing.
[76:39.46]Alright, so 101 is here?
[76:44.28]This is 106.
[76:45.58]What?
[76:46.16]Wait, huh?
[76:49.28]Where's 101?
[76:50.25]This hotel sucks!
[76:55.31]It's so confusing!
[76:56.35]Huh?
[76:59.57]Okay, 101...
[77:10.89]103 is dark.
[77:11.59]Okay.
[77:24.13]Please don't yell.
[77:24.65]You're going to lose your voice.
[77:25.67]Oh, you're right.
[77:29.09]There it is.
[77:29.45]This floor has a dead end?
[77:34.96]Okay, either by in the door, in rooms, or in the ground floor kitchen.
[77:41.91]by the door and rooms are okay so I can use the mirror to see clues about where to go it will also help you locate lost keys okay I got some items use the mirror in the dark rooms
[78:34.16]Okay.
[78:34.54]Okay.
[78:42.92]Didn't I already do that, though?
[78:48.29]That was the little girl, right?
[78:50.11]I already did that one.
[78:56.30]OK.
[78:57.68]This is hallway that I haven't gone through over here.
[79:01.50]She might have some more stuff now.
[79:04.78]Let me just finish exploring out here.
[79:06.40]104.
[79:12.98]Use it again.
[79:24.52]Oh shit, wait.
[79:39.58]don't use it too much is it why is it bad okay
[80:01.76]There's one more that I haven't done.
[80:04.34]Use it in a dark room.
[80:12.17]Oh, fuck.
[80:14.53]He's coming.
[80:16.89]Is he actually coming?
[80:21.35]Oh, this is crying.
[80:21.93]I can't believe I found both here.
[80:24.42]Okay.
[80:25.54]So... I think I've seen everything in the first floor except for the dark rooms.
[80:36.17]It's not right here, right?
[80:46.92]Oh.
[80:48.04]Don't open the door.
[80:52.03]How do I bolt the door?
[80:52.79]How do I bolt the door?
[80:54.63]How do I bolt the door?
[80:55.95]What's the button I do?
[80:58.23]What room am I even in?
[81:01.41]What room am I in?
[81:06.04]How do I use the key?
[81:06.68]105?
[81:06.70]I don't even... Could I press 105?
[81:18.33]Dude, you press the talk button to do it.
[81:39.04]105.
[81:39.87]Oh my god, what a pain.
[81:41.09]Do I even have it?
[81:43.69]I don't even have the key to this room.
[81:49.33]Okay, well, I'm leaving.
[81:50.43]Let's go.
[81:59.43]Okay.
[82:00.37]Now I'm going back down.
[82:06.83]Don't be here.
[82:13.48]No.
[82:13.60]What do you mean no?
[82:21.24]Show the girl the new stuff.
[82:24.49]That's the plan.
[82:27.57]But wasn't there a dark room over here?
[82:29.65]I don't care.
[82:34.88]Let's just get me out of here.
[82:47.29]Wait, I can lock this one.
[83:07.50]Okay.
[83:08.92]You can't get in now.
[83:11.94]Fuck you.
[83:12.38]You can't get in.
[83:18.85]You can't get in.
[83:20.02]I'm safe.
[83:22.58]I'm safe.
[83:31.52]Now just like taunt him?
[83:36.83]Wouldn't he have a key?
[83:37.63]He's like a weird guy.
[83:39.89]Wouldn't he have like a... I don't know.
[83:41.59]I feel like he would have like a hotel key.
[83:48.99]He, like, owns the hotel.
[83:49.99]Alright, I think I'm getting out.
[84:00.00]I'm not calling him out, no.
[84:01.30]Okay.
[84:04.16]I just have to get to the elevator and I'm gonna go down.
[84:06.44]Fuck it, let's go.
[84:07.54]Unlock the door first.
[84:08.60]Oh.
[84:23.48]Okay, I gotta... Where the fuck are you?
[84:27.04]No!
[84:27.54]No!
[84:27.94]Why are you in the same exact spot, man?
[84:29.92]You're in the exact same spot.
[84:32.48]Oh my god, get in a... I don't know.
[84:34.56]I didn't want to click on that.
[84:36.28]I didn't want to click on that, I swear to god.
[84:42.64]He's camping the elevator.
[84:45.39]Oh no, this is bad.
[85:10.75]Oh my God.
[85:12.17]You've got to be kidding me.
[85:14.11]No, not this.
[85:15.57]I just came out.
[85:21.42]Click.
[85:22.66]Oh my God.
[85:23.96]I wish I could have a solution to this issue.
[85:27.18]Do I have the key for 107?
[85:30.47]I don't.
[85:30.93]I don't know.
[85:31.63]Just fucking hide in the bathroom.
[85:37.69]I'm dead.
[85:38.63]I'm just dead.
[85:43.87]There's no way he doesn't know I'm in here.
[85:45.65]He's gonna just... I'm dead.
[85:46.75]It's over.
[85:51.35]Yeah, I know.
[85:52.15]You know I'm in here.
[85:52.93]Of course you do.
[85:53.55]There's no way you don't open this door.
[86:02.29]Bullshit.
[86:02.81]He's not... He's still there.
[86:07.22]And now, again...
[86:09.67]Every time I see this guy, my memory wipes the entire floor plan of this hotel.
[86:35.33]Get me to the fucking elevator.
[86:37.01]Where is the elevator from here?
[86:38.81]Okay, this is 107.
[86:40.97]It's like... I gotta go around here.
[86:44.62]No, this is wrong.
[86:46.04]It's... There's like a little tiny entryway that I go down.
[86:50.26]Which is right here.
[86:52.50]Right?
[86:52.78]No.
[86:53.28]Is it?
[86:54.24]Is this correct?
[86:57.19]No, it's not correct.
[86:58.63]There's one hallway that leads to the elevator and I have to fucking find where it is.
[87:03.11]There's literally one hallway that goes there.
[87:07.70]It's this one right here.
[87:11.22]Is it this one?
[87:16.00]No, this is the fucking suit of armor!
[87:19.82]I DON'T CARE!
[87:20.66]FUCKING COME FACE ME!
[87:29.05]This is literally- I'm following the exit signs!
[87:32.09]There's one hallway I have to find!
[87:39.99]The exit signs are the green sign of the guy going like this, right?
[87:56.05]It's the arrows.
[87:57.01]I know, but then I go that way and that's the only sign there is.
[88:00.03]And then I just go walk around a circle.
[88:01.69]I don't know where I am.
[88:02.75]It's a concrete level.
[88:04.09]Why would I play the game of the hotel rooms?
[88:41.67]Fuck you, Guy.
[89:00.70]Okay, let's talk.
[89:04.96]Let's talk.
[89:08.44]Okay, I have new things to show you.
[89:14.88]What do you think about this?
[89:15.92]Okay.
[89:31.53]Who did the child's purse belong to?
[89:32.99]It was mine.
[89:35.79]It was for my birthday, but it was stolen.
[89:43.25]OK.
[89:44.79]Where did the bottle of diazepam come from?
[89:46.67]I don't know.
[89:52.89]Why is there a bloodstained cloth in one of the drawers?
[89:58.32]It could have been mine.
[90:00.30]OK.
[90:03.96]So now... Okay.
[90:16.75]A blood-stained cloth?
[90:20.39]Alright.
[90:21.05]So I... You can only select two things at once?
[90:28.55]Okay.
[90:28.85]I don't think we learned anything new.
[90:34.19]It's like two things.
[90:37.57]You have to pair things?
[90:38.83]Okay, so... This is yours?
[90:43.29]The bloodstained cloth and... Bloodstained cloth and... The purse?
[90:57.60]Right?
[90:57.80]I mean, that's... Match two replies you think connect to work out the spirit's story.
[91:04.16]I mean, is that... Okay.
[91:08.32]Pair sighting replies with item replies for faster progress.
[91:14.18]Okay.
[91:19.05]Sighting replies in... Maybe it doesn't have an answer.
[91:22.43]And the sword.
[91:29.79]Cloth could have been mine.
[91:31.43]Had the sword.
[91:31.87]I didn't like it.
[91:34.06]Like that?
[91:40.29]How do I, like, say yes to this?
[91:47.19]Okay, the sword and the purse and Jimmy stealing.
[91:52.53]The purse was mine.
[91:57.17]It was for my birthday, but it was stolen.
[91:58.51]Okay.
[92:00.89]But pair that with what?
[92:09.87]Cloth could have been mine.
[92:11.37]How do we know that?
[92:17.17]Showing keys.
[92:18.53]Showing everything.
[92:24.15]Settings, not items.
[92:29.00]Okay, a boy called Jimmy locked me in the basement, then he started stealing things from me.
[92:33.26]And the purse was mine, and it was stolen from me.
[92:35.42]When you said Jimmy stole things from you, is that connected with what you said about the purse?
[92:49.36]Okay.
[92:51.20]Go to the ground.
[93:03.35]Ow!
[93:07.03]Okay, so now go to the ground floor.
[93:12.02]Okay, Jimmy wouldn't listen.
[93:17.42]Okay.
[93:19.45]We're going up to the ground floor.
[93:22.03]And then we're going to follow the compass.
[93:53.40]What the fuck is going on?
[94:16.88]Should we talk?
[94:20.72]Is it Amy?
[94:26.57]Alright, so stealing.
[94:28.35]I saw you shouting to Jimmy to give your toy back.
[94:33.50]Why did he take it?
[94:39.22]It doesn't help those funny.
[94:41.00]OK.
[94:49.18]Stealing my toy.
[95:08.08]Is there anything else I need to do?
[95:09.05]I gotta find the toy.
[95:24.26]Wait, scrying machine.
[95:25.34]I gotta find the toy.
[95:39.73]You know, I haven't been up to the third floor in a long time.
[95:46.22]Let's go to the third floor.
[95:52.00]Third floor is the only one that I really... ...have not really looked around.
[96:21.12]Let's go 309, 308.
[96:22.68]That one.
[96:28.95]I feel like these were... One of these was dark, right?
[96:40.34]Did I get everything from here?
[96:41.24]Yeah, this is where the goodbye was.
[96:47.55]One of these was dark.
[96:59.47]Which one was dark?
[97:02.43]No, isn't that... I just came out of this one.
[97:07.11]Alright, you know why it's confusing?
[97:09.29]Okay, yeah.
[97:13.75]Because I'm turning... Alright.
[97:15.33]My brain wants to open the door, and this is what's causing all these issues for me.
[97:19.33]When I open the door, I'm imagining that 308 will be in front of me, but I keep turning and putting my back, and the door that I just came out of is in front of me.
[97:27.60]You see what I mean?
[97:30.14]Like, when I open 309, it's like, I have 308.
[97:33.26]But you turn your body.
[97:34.96]That's what keeps happening to me.
[97:38.01]I figured it out.
[97:38.81]Now I know why I'm so fucking lost.
[97:40.29]Alright, none of these are dark.
[97:47.05]I already got that.
[97:47.87]Okay, yeah.
[97:48.55]No, I did everything here.
[97:52.02]Crime is skyrocketing.
[98:08.27]Okay, so now... Let me check these.
[98:11.76]302.
[98:17.60]Alright, 302 is dark.
[98:19.10]Do I have the key to 302?
[98:19.90]Why would I?
[98:20.16]No.
[98:20.22]Scry.
[98:43.86]Is that water?
[99:01.38]Sound G Okay G again
[99:12.34]Well, isn't that where... We're on, like, the little girl's quest, right?
[99:15.08]We need to find a toy.
[99:16.62]It's turpentine.
[99:23.70]Shit.
[99:35.65]Okay.
[99:37.71]Do I have enough to know what happened?
[99:39.46]What?
[99:43.32]Do I just have to go down and put the right stuff when I talk to Amy?
[99:48.29]I think I already have everything, don't I?
[99:49.49]I need a toy, though.
[99:52.77]I need to find the toy.
[99:55.79]Oh, shit.
[99:56.81]Okay, he's coming.
[100:16.32]I will have explored the entire third floor after this.
[100:19.96]Should I just get out here and run?
[100:23.68]Where is he?
[100:24.10]Why is he just standing here?
[100:32.87]Whatever.
[100:33.27]I'm just kidding.
[100:33.71]I gotta go.
[100:38.63]Okay.
[100:39.18]So don't get turned around.
[100:40.30]So this is very dark.
[100:46.02]I knew you were behind me, you fucking asshole!
[101:00.89]I'm not gonna scream again for the rest of the night, I promise.
[101:20.24]What did you take?
[101:22.50]What did you take?
[101:22.98]Did you take something?
[101:23.74]I don't even know what you took.
[101:27.84]You took the fucking radio again.
[101:31.86]First floor store near the stairs.
[101:40.05]I knew he was behind me too.
[101:41.31]I just didn't want to turn and have it hit me in the head.
[101:46.58]Okay.
[101:47.64]So.
[101:49.04]Have I?
[101:50.28]Where am I now?
[101:54.02]I'm on the first floor right now.
[101:55.20]Okay.
[102:01.36]I need a sign to tell me where I'm going.
[102:03.93]Where's the exit sign?
[102:22.00]You know what?
[102:22.42]It's this floor here.
[102:24.26]This is the problem for my head.
[102:26.64]This place.
[102:27.58]It's like fucking nine paths.
[102:33.00]No, I need to get the thing from here.
[102:34.60]Right here.
[102:40.78]What is this?
[102:47.83]This is open now.
[102:52.31]Can I touch this?
[102:55.19]No.
[103:02.47]Give that back.
[103:02.99]No.
[103:32.03]What's in here?
[103:35.99]There's nothing here.
[103:40.95]Is someone there?
[103:46.70]No, there's nothing.
[103:54.52]OK, I'm going to go to 2.
[104:02.79]I have the key to the stairs.
[104:10.43]Go to G. I feel like I was already there like three times.
[104:13.27]Do I have the key to the stairs?
[104:14.75]Okay.
[104:25.22]So.
[104:27.02]I mean, should I?
[104:28.86]I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[104:30.58]He can't be in there, right?
[104:34.25]I'm going to G, I guess.
[104:46.62]Stairs are safe.
[104:47.74]Yeah.
[104:51.66]Okay.
[104:56.69]Going back to that room.
[104:58.55]Talk to her again.
[104:59.41]See if I can't...
[105:03.66]Right?
[105:04.16]I mean... Wait, hold on.
[105:08.13]I can't go in here?
[105:08.81]Come on.
[105:12.89]What about this room?
[105:14.52]Can I do anything in here?
[105:16.26]Ooh!
[105:17.08]Hold on.
[105:36.32]Alright.
[105:39.20]Perpentine on the bear.
[105:40.98]That's a bear, right?
[105:45.92]OK.
[105:57.80]I don't have a bear though.
[106:04.37]Okay.
[106:04.93]So that way what's right here.
[106:11.09]Okay.
[106:11.55]So can I talk to you about this?
[106:17.69]Is anyone there?
[106:23.66]Okay.
[106:24.22]So, um, the turpentine is Amy.
[106:34.71]I don't have a bear though.
[106:43.78]I probably need to find a bear.
[106:57.45]Stealing.
[106:57.95]Like that, does that make sense?
[107:03.51]What you said about Jimmy stealing your toy, does that have something to do with what you said about the turpentine and lighter?
[107:10.87]Yeah.
[107:13.29]He stole my toy with that stuff in the bottle.
[107:22.18]I hated him.
[107:23.82]Right?
[107:24.78]For one.
[107:26.73]Alright, let's go.
[107:27.41]Ow!
[107:33.29]OK, floor one.
[107:44.28]Is there anything else I can do here?
[107:45.68]Probably not.
[107:46.92]Let's just get to floor one.
[107:50.29]I have to complete at least one quest in this game.
[108:01.30]It's your favorite floor.
[108:02.66]Alright, we're gonna drop the, uh, I mean, it's getting to be a little darker.
[108:20.79]Let's go ahead and drop this.
