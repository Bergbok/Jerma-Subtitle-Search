[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.36]Somebody said, I was waiting for you to cancel the stream because you suck.
[00:08.94]Come on, man.
[00:14.66]Why would you wait here for me to cancel the stream?
[00:21.36]Okay, hold on.
[00:22.06]How long has it been?
[00:23.70]It's been 45 minutes.
[00:25.24]Hold on, hold on.
[00:25.88]Where is he?
[00:26.98]He canceled.
[00:27.50]Alright, nice.
[00:28.00]Now I can go back to my life.
[00:36.62]Oh, he's like, he's kind of late today.
[00:39.91]Wow, it's been like two hours.
[00:42.57]Fuck.
[00:47.59]Anyways, um, wait, what, we got like, there's too many, there's too much music going on right now.
[00:52.67]I just spoiled it for you.
[00:55.99]We've got a cozy stream ahead.
[00:57.35]Yeah.
[00:59.29]Yeah.
[01:01.17]I feel like we've been, um, we've been hitting the gas for the last couple of weeks.
[01:06.42]It might be time, just for the next couple of days, to sit back and relax and play one of these old fucking games.
[01:18.32]This is probably going to be a very, very cozy stream.
[01:23.00]Whoops.
[01:24.94]I don't want to relax.
[01:29.92]This is Zoo Tycoon 2.
[01:34.79]All the animals edition.
[01:36.07]This is the ultimate edition.
[01:37.11]It has everything.
[01:37.77]Every expansion.
[01:39.81]I got to learn how to play.
[01:42.31]We're going to be in the tutorial for like 30 minutes.
[01:44.78]Because I want to know what I'm doing.
[01:57.54]Do you ever wish it was just a little bit colder?
[02:02.06]I like the temperature the way it is.
[02:03.16]But... So, let's break down the next week here.
[02:08.43]Okay?
[02:09.75]So we've got Zoo Calamity 2.
[02:13.93]Whatever the hell it's called.
[02:16.45]Zoo Tycoon 2.
[02:20.05]For today.
[02:21.39]And then... If Red Dead Online works tomorrow... Then I'm gonna play that.
[02:30.46]Or, I don't know, maybe I won't.
[02:32.06]Maybe I'll keep playing Zoo Tycoon.
[02:33.80]Maybe I'll just bury my Twitch channel into the ground and play Zoo Tycoon 2 for the next, like, four weeks.
[02:42.92]But, uh, then, obviously, so we're gonna go, we're gonna go today, tomorrow, and then I'm gonna take, uh, so that'd be Tuesday, Wednesday, I'm gonna take Thursday off, and then I'm gonna get, make sure I'm prepared, uh, Friday and Saturday.
[02:58.42]Saturday is, by the way, uh, the green screen, movie night is on Sunday.
[03:05.92]So, as of Thursday, the 29th here, you've gotta get a submission in.
[03:13.30]If you have a submission, make sure you read those rules.
[03:15.44]It's pinned in that Discord.
[03:16.44]You only got another couple days here.
[03:22.43]So we got... Every weekend we've had something fun to do.
[03:25.63]That's what I want to do, man.
[03:26.49]I want to make every fucking weekend.
[03:28.47]I want to do something interesting.
[03:32.56]Free shit.
[03:33.60]We got free shit coming in?
[03:39.92]What do you mean free shit?
[03:41.26]Where's the free shit?
[03:49.44]I missed the context.
[03:53.31]It was somebody just trolling.
[03:54.95]Oh.
[03:55.75]Oh, oh.
[03:59.87]Oh.
[04:00.23]I thought I was in the middle of a giveaway.
[04:02.23]I'm like, really?
[04:02.83]What are they giving away?
[04:05.13]Can I get something?
[04:07.33]How do I join?
[04:10.77]I want a fucking new five button mouse.
[04:14.72]Alright.
[04:18.10]Don't get a five button mouse, by the way.
[04:19.68]Just not comfortable.
[04:21.55]Two is all you need.
[04:22.51]Two and then the third button on top.
[04:23.85]Alright, let's play Zooka.
[04:25.43]I can't say this fucking word.
[04:29.03]The sea.
[04:29.75]The tycoon.
[04:30.97]Zooka.
[04:34.93]It's like somebody just snips a portion of my brain that makes it so I can't say.
[04:40.56]Zoo tycoon.
[04:41.02]Zoo tycoon.
[04:43.20]Zoo tycoon.
[04:44.70]Zoo tycoon.
[04:47.37]That sounds wrong.
[04:48.93]Is that correct?
[04:50.73]Am I saying that word right?
[04:55.86]Zoo Tycoon.
[04:59.74]I'm losing my mind.
[05:00.64]Alright, let's go.
[05:02.60]Thanks for joining us.
[05:03.22]Let's get this off.
[05:07.17]And hey, look at that.
[05:09.25]Here's Zoo Tycoon.
[05:14.98]Why can't they just make it Tycoon of Zoo?
[05:24.37]You got hit on the head too many times during the green screen.
[05:27.97]Listen to that music.
[05:29.73]This is old school.
[05:32.31]They just spin the world around.
[05:33.41]Alright.
[05:37.00]Whoa!
[05:40.04]Does anybody think that was funny?
[05:43.26]Did anybody else feel that?
[05:46.70]Alright, let's learn how to control the game.
[05:51.68]Alright, that's the kind of joke you make with your son.
[05:55.75]Hey, here we are.
[05:57.31]Here we are, Daniel.
[06:00.15]And what's that?
[06:00.75]Whoa, I can feel the Earth moving underneath my legs, Daniel.
[06:05.35]And Daniel's probably two or three years old and thinks it's really happening.
[06:11.34]But Dad, what happened?
[06:12.50]And Dad's like, I'm just kidding, Daniel.
[06:15.44]Go to bed.
[06:17.25]So Dad can play Zoo Tycoon.
[06:27.11]What a gamer, Dad.
[06:33.42]Fuck you, Dad.
[06:33.98]I want to play Fortnite.
[06:34.88]Get out of here with that Fortnite shit.
[06:38.44]Zoo Tycoon, I have 6,100 hours in Zoo Tycoon 2.
[06:43.82]Daniel, how many hours do you have in Fortnite?
[06:49.95]Oh, what's that, Daniel?
[06:51.51]Oh, only like 40 hours, because I only allow you to use the computer an hour a day?
[06:56.75]Get out of here.
[07:04.64]Dad's got work to do.
[07:09.61]Alright, let's learn how to control the video game.
[07:12.41]Welcome to Zootoyacoon.
[07:13.73]I fucking can't say it.
[07:18.66]Guys, you understand, we're not even getting past the title of the game.
[07:22.96]That's how this stream is starting.
[07:26.42]I can't even get past the title.
[07:29.56]In the following tutorials, you'll learn the basics of how to control the camera.
[07:33.46]Then you'll move on to construction techniques and accessing all the information available to you about your zoo.
[07:38.25]Let's get started.
[07:39.21]Okay.
[07:41.07]Alright.
[07:41.33]So it's click move.
[07:43.71]Open the goal panel by clicking on the scenario goals button.
[07:45.99]So here's scenario goals.
[07:48.20]Click display information about the current goals and challenges.
[07:50.62]So that's the challenge button.
[07:53.22]Your scenario challenge goals will fill here when you play a campaign or challenge game.
[07:58.66]Normally this panel will update whenever you succeed or fail to complete a goal.
[08:02.03]The tutorials are a little different though, so for now, this is the only thing that's gonna be here.
[08:06.23]Cheese goal, okay.
[08:07.51]Close the goal panel.
[08:16.53]Great, return to the goal panel anytime to see what your current goals are.
[08:20.75]Okay.
[08:21.86]Easy enough.
[08:22.94]Now we can learn how to move the camera around the game.
[08:24.52]World, check the button.
[08:27.58]Hey, this is chill.
[08:28.80]This is going to be a chill stream.
[08:29.90]I'm going to learn how to take care of the animals.
[08:32.70]See, there's me right there.
[08:34.93]Now we need to practice moving the camera around.
[08:36.47]Scroll the map by using the arrow keys.
[08:39.47]Or W-A-S-D.
[08:41.07]That's more comfortable.
[08:42.89]Uh-huh.
[08:44.09]And this is zoom in and zoom out.
[08:46.63]You can do zoom in and zoom out.
[08:47.62]It's the mouse wheel.
[08:48.50]Got it.
[08:50.07]Rotate the camera by pressing on the primary game button panel, or click and hold the left mouse while you move.
[08:56.41]Look at that.
[08:58.00]Okay, it's that easy.
[08:59.46]Guest mode.
[09:00.28]Enter zoo guest mode by clicking on the zoo guest mode button.
[09:05.44]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[09:09.60]I mean, this thing made me so much more excited.
[09:15.04]In zoo guest mode, you can walk around your zoo by pressing the left mouse button.
[09:20.00]Normally, when you enter zoo guest mode, the mouse cursor is hidden so that your view is unobstructed.
[09:25.28]To toggle your mouse cursor on and off, or to view, or to switch to photo safari view, right-click the mouse.
[09:35.77]This turns into a first-person game?
[09:38.51]Oh man, this is gonna be fun.
[09:40.92]You can also take on the duties of a maintenance worker to sweep trash and empty trash cans.
[09:46.77]When you approach something that you can interact with, it'll automatically be selected.
[09:50.05]Just hit spacebar to perform the action.
[09:51.63]Now it's your turn.
[09:53.33]Press the left mouse button or use the moving keys to walk up to a piece of trash.
[10:04.00]Is that person stuck in there?
[10:07.24]Holy shit, that person almost died.
[10:09.68]That was like almost a vicious camel attack.
[10:11.53]Alright.
[10:12.77]Pick it.
[10:15.73]Great, you can also perform zookeeper dirties in the... You can also do dirty zookeeper things.
[10:20.90]You can feed and water animals, groom them, heal them, rake poop.
[10:28.11]Okay.
[10:30.81]Well, we're gonna be here for a while.
[10:36.00]Uh, same way.
[10:37.24]Heal them and of course break them.
[10:38.50]Doing these things yourself could mean that you don't need to pay a staff member to do it.
[10:43.02]Very helpful for a financially struggling zoo.
[10:45.66]But I can do it all myself?
[10:48.16]I'm not gonna have any staff.
[10:50.54]I always get so fucking destroyed in these games because I hire too many people.
[10:54.82]You got five janitors, four maintenance guys, six zookeepers.
[10:58.88]No, no, no, no, no.
[10:59.60]I'm just gonna walk around and if something needs to be done, I'm gonna do it myself.
[11:03.60]I can walk around with a portable hose.
[11:08.12]That's all you need is a hose.
[11:11.16]Don't- don't understand?
[11:12.70]Every single thing, every single job you could possibly think of, in the world, just requires a hose.
[11:18.58]Just spray it.
[11:20.84]Ah, there's like dirt all over my deck.
[11:22.16]Just fuckin' spray it with a hose.
[11:23.29]It's done.
[11:23.57]Oh, I, uh... I... My car!
[11:29.11]I need to get a car wash.
[11:29.95]Just spray it with a fuckin' hose, dude.
[11:31.25]Don't worry about it.
[11:31.83]It's easy.
[11:32.41]Oh, my taxes aren't done on time.
[11:35.29]Just spray your taxes with a hose.
[11:42.19]Time to check out Photosafari mode.
[11:43.71]Click on the Photosafari view button.
[11:45.13]Okay, so here's the photo mode.
[11:46.69]You can take pictures and shit.
[11:51.81]This is just going to be Hey You Pikachu, right?
[11:57.55]What's the game that just came out?
[11:59.73]Let's Go Pikachu, right?
[12:06.29]And this photo, so you can zoom your camera in, take photographs, press spacebar to take a picture.
[12:11.47]Okay.
[12:13.55]Let's return.
[12:13.97]I want to move this.
[12:22.32]That's a pretty cool photo.
[12:23.16]Hold on.
[12:28.46]This is such a spy cam.
[12:29.92]Okay.
[12:35.23]I got it.
[12:39.06]Just hose the trash.
[12:40.30]It's fine.
[12:40.66]Alright, click the overhead button.
[12:43.54]It's this one right here.
[12:44.40]That's the big circle is the overhead mode.
[12:46.20]You need the overview map by clicking on the overview.
[12:48.78]This one, click to switch the overview, which allows you to jump directly to any exhibit or specific zoo area.
[12:53.85]Okay.
[12:55.67]The overview map gives you a broad layout of your zoo.
[12:58.25]You can quickly jump around from place to place in your zoo.
[13:02.46]Okay, so there's a crocodile exhibit.
[13:04.88]Oops, a daisy.
[13:06.60]Press F1 to open the Zoopedia.
[13:09.57]This is fucking a ton of information.
[13:12.53]Information about game controls, animals in the zoo.
[13:14.83]Press F1 to open Zoopedia.
[13:16.07]It's on panels.
[13:17.19]You can click on some shit and learn some stuff.
[13:19.73]Okay.
[13:21.21]F1 is... Alright, we did it.
[13:24.37]I know how to play.
[13:27.25]Never mind.
[13:28.87]Click the next.
[13:29.47]Yeah, let's just go.
[13:30.60]Let's bang them all out.
[13:31.54]What time?
[13:32.04]Would that take, like, seven minutes?
[13:43.28]In the following, you will learn the basics of construction.
[13:45.58]How to make a basic exhibit.
[13:46.60]Change terrain.
[13:47.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:48.20]Let's start.
[13:48.76]Let's go.
[13:50.46]Select the Recycle Objects and Buildings button.
[13:53.39]So this is this one.
[13:57.36]Alright, somebody correct me here.
[14:00.58]I need to be corrected if I'm wrong.
[14:03.12]This is like the Windows 3.1 panel, isn't it?
[14:06.18]This is an old Windows panel.
[14:08.82]That used to exist.
[14:09.80]This is my computer.
[14:12.42]This is the undo button.
[14:15.46]Yes, it is.
[14:16.14]This used to be there.
[14:17.10]This is the panel for Windows 3.1.
[14:17.98]He's a boomer.
[14:27.19]40-year-old streamer.
[14:29.18]Getting real fucking close.
[14:31.02]Sooner or later, I have to stop saying the F-word.
[14:32.46]After 40, you can't say the F-word anymore.
[14:35.54]What 40-year-old do you know that says the F-word?
[14:38.06]I don't know very many.
[14:39.10]They're like, oh, hi, yes, how are you?
[14:41.19]I'm a 40-year-old guy.
[14:42.43]They're not like, hey, what's up, fucking dude?
[14:44.35]I gotta stop doing that.
[14:52.30]Alright, remove unwanted objects from your zoo.
[14:54.34]Click the button.
[14:56.08]Look for the solitary tree inside the rectangular area enclosed by a path.
[15:02.10]It's marked with an X painted in the dirt.
[15:04.53]The baobab tree is right in the center of this area.
[15:08.17]Move your cursor over the baobab tree and click to recycle it.
[15:13.13]Okay, we're looking for an X. We're looking for... Don't, please.
[15:17.85]I'm fucking kidding.
[15:19.48]Good job, you will receive cash for recycled objects, but it will only be a portion of its full purchase price.
[15:24.17]Note that you can't recycle animals.
[15:27.47]That just wouldn't be right.
[15:28.53]Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[15:32.51]Yeah, I mean... It's kind of... Can't, I mean... Is, like, eating animals recycling them?
[15:46.10]Think about that for a second.
[15:48.99]That is essentially like recycling.
[15:51.89]You consume.
[15:53.01]You don't waste.
[15:57.41]Reusing.
[15:57.91]And then you plant the bones.
[16:05.74]And then a tree grows out of the bone.
[16:08.52]And that's where animals come from.
[16:13.12]A cow tree.
[16:17.74]Alright, wow, whoops, we really wanted that tree.
[16:21.13]We can get it back though, click on the undo button right now.
[16:24.49]I wonder how many times you can do that.
[16:31.47]That dinosaur pee was recycled over the next few thousand years to become your coffee.
[16:36.64]That's fine.
[16:39.68]I don't care.
[16:41.78]You could tell me that coffee...
[16:44.12]was like rat shit mixed in water and I'd still drink it.
[16:48.37]I would.
[16:49.11]How would that change anything?
[16:50.31]Right?
[16:51.29]Oh my God, no, there's no, I would not eat that.
[16:53.27]I wouldn't drink.
[16:53.77]Yes, you would.
[16:54.33]What changed?
[16:54.67]How does that change?
[16:58.91]Oh, coffee is actually, it's burnt cigarette ashes and rat shit mixed in water.
[17:03.98]There's a huge study that just a big whistleblower came out.
[17:06.94]I'd be like, I don't care.
[17:12.59]Alright, undo, you can use undo to reverse the last thing you did.
[17:16.12]This is very handy.
[17:16.90]Yeah, I know.
[17:18.16]Wait, note that you can only undo the last thing you did.
[17:22.54]So you can't just control Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z. You can only do one thing.
[17:30.84]Video games weren't...
[17:34.39]that advanced yet, so you can only go back one time.
[17:36.81]Which, I mean, this is one of the greatest games ever made, so who cares?
[17:39.45]Alright, let's build a building.
[17:41.10]The construction panel is where you'll want to place fences, paths, zoo building scenarios.
[17:45.24]I'm sorry, you know what keeps happening?
[17:47.00]Is my fucking cigarette ash rat shit is... There's a little bit on the bottom that I didn't wipe up, and I have it on a coaster, and every time I pick up the... the glass, the coaster sticks to the bottom of the coffee and then falls off after I pick it up for a second.
[18:02.33]There's nothing I can do about it.
[18:07.30]Alright, fences, paths, zoos, yeah.
[18:10.03]All kinds of the man-made objects in your zoo.
[18:11.60]Click the check button.
[18:12.32]Let's go.
[18:16.61]Uh, fence is the most common way to keep your animals in and your guests out.
[18:20.75]Click on the rectangle fence.
[18:23.05]So this is the rectangle fence placement.
[18:25.25]This is freeform.
[18:26.29]I gotta make, I gotta, I gotta, like, pay attention.
[18:28.61]I am.
[18:29.23]I am.
[18:30.99]Uh, easily create an enclosed habitat.
[18:33.51]So, find the rectangle area enclosed by a path.
[18:36.95]It's the same area where you just replaced the bob tree.
[18:39.75]Let's create a fenced area.
[18:42.41]Select the chain link fence.
[18:45.49]And they click on the ground to anchor the corner.
[18:49.46]So I want to do it like here.
[18:53.16]Alright, but here's that.
[18:53.98]Do I want it on the Mario Kart track or do I want it off the Mario Kart track?
[19:00.64]Off the Mario Kart track, right?
[19:04.85]On the Mario Kart track.
[19:06.03]No, but how is Luigi going to get in first place?
[19:14.66]Alright.
[19:17.10]Anchor the corner.
[19:18.00]Just right here is fine, whatever.
[19:20.44]Will you mouse to see a preview of the enclosure and click again to place the fence?
[19:22.86]Make a fenced area as large as the rectangle.
[19:29.57]Great!
[19:30.35]Basic enclosure.
[19:31.07]Later you can try the octagonal placement mode to make an octagonal shape.
[19:35.35]Or the rubber band mode to place single sections.
[19:37.39]Click the check button to continue.
[19:40.37]Now it's time to place a gate.
[19:41.49]This is where, this is just the queue line.
[19:43.35]Staff gate.
[19:46.31]I guess it could really just go, like, right here.
[19:50.13]Place it over the fenced area you just made, the gate preview will snap into place.
[19:53.21]Like, have it right there.
[19:57.31]You want to make sure that your enclosed areas have gates so your staff can get in and take care of the animals.
[20:00.94]Right now we're only using the chain link fence.
[20:02.58]There are all kinds of different fences.
[20:04.40]Staff gate will automatically work on any of them.
[20:06.10]Just, you know.
[20:07.54]You know.
[20:08.42]Whatever.
[20:10.16]Alright, here's the scenery tab.
[20:11.24]So this is the fence tab.
[20:12.28]That's where you keep animals in.
[20:13.56]Here's the scenery tab.
[20:22.46]Somebody just said chain link.
[20:25.48]No, we don't talk about cryptocurrency anymore on this channel.
[20:29.40]We don't discuss crypto assets anymore, okay?
[20:42.33]It's alright.
[20:42.93]Everything's fine.
[20:47.15]that's how you know he lost big I didn't lose anything up here upstairs inside of the skull there's a device up there there's a thing up there that has so much so much in it and I let me tell you I got coaster I'm I'm I got out alright I left some in I got out I was interested not invested let's make that very clear
[21:16.95]I'm changing coaster.
[21:17.81]Alright, I have a different coaster now.
[21:27.06]Mom says it's my turn.
[21:28.40]No, it's not!
[21:30.46]Alright, normally you'd see many objects on the scenery by panel, but for now, we've narrowed it down to just one, the donation box.
[21:37.12]Click the... Alright, the donation box.
[21:38.87]Okay!
[21:40.11]Okay, I can get by on this one!
[21:43.15]You have a donation box selected.
[21:44.35]Move your mouse over the world to see a preview...
[21:48.46]Okay, you can rotate it with the, uh, what keys are those?
[21:52.96]Okay, that's weird.
[21:55.07]Oh, shit.
[21:56.67]You should place donation boxes near every single stream.
[22:00.15]If viewers can't find a donation box, make sure to put an overlay on your stream telling them exactly where to go, and maybe even in your title as well.
[22:09.81]So then they are absolutely certain of the correct way to give you any amount of money during the whole stream.
[22:17.36]I'm sorry, that's all I saw.
[22:26.36]Alright.
[22:27.86]It's often a good idea to place multiple donation boxes so that guests won't be inconvenienced in any way.
[22:32.99]So if guests can't find a donation, the cash will stay in their pockets.
[22:39.60]this is how you make money okay pathing tab you'll see that there are a number of different paths that you can choose from guests don't so much care what type of path surfaces in your zoo but they do care that there is one click check button on this panel paths work like fences do click on the ground to anchor the path then move the mouse yeah yeah so this is a standard asphalt path
[23:10.69]No, I'm not going to do it.
[23:12.03]I don't know why I thought that would be funny.
[23:16.61]Yeah, I'm just going to say it and then delete it, okay?
[23:18.95]You know, I had diarrhea last night.
[23:22.61]Yeah.
[23:23.11]Well, it wasn't my leg's fault.
[23:24.18]It was my ass' fault.
[23:35.40]And now you can delete it because there's no context and it makes no sense.
[23:41.42]Then move the the mouse to see a preview of the path.
[23:44.72]What does that have to do with a concrete though?
[23:48.03]Somebody make that joke funny like change it to like I had diarrhea on the ground or something Like I or like I fell down on the ground and I landed on my bum and so it wasn't Somebody will figure it out and then I want a 10% commission I don't know what's wrong with me tonight
[24:10.51]Then move the mouse to see a preview.
[24:12.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:12.79]Click and place it.
[24:14.77]Notice that the path on the map is very narrow around the rectangular exhibit area.
[24:18.01]Place some new path to make it wider for your guests.
[24:21.84]Wait, it wants me to, like, do this.
[24:23.20]Okay.
[24:23.42]You want to make sure that your path will lead to your exhibit's guest stand-on path to view exhibits.
[24:30.28]They stand around.
[24:31.06]So if your paths are far too away, your guests won't see your exhibits.
[24:35.00]They'll miss out on your great animals, and you'll miss out on their donations.
[24:38.55]Yup, you'll want those paths leading to your donation boxes too.
[24:42.43]Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[24:44.95]Why do I keep reading that of all the things?
[24:47.25]Alright, here's the building.
[24:47.97]So this is the fence tab, path tab, building tab.
[24:52.35]There's all kinds of buildings.
[24:55.52]Jerma, calm down.
[24:58.98]I'm alright.
[25:01.56]okay from food and drink stands to restrooms and more yep I purchased a hot dog food stand a pretzel cart and a soda drink stand
[25:10.95]You already have the hot dog stand.
[25:13.30]Move your mouse over the zoo to see a preview.
[25:15.34]Yeah, yeah.
[25:17.18]Notice the green access arrow which shows side that guests will approach.
[25:21.64]Okay, so this is the side that they approach.
[25:23.94]Go ahead and place one of each building now.
[25:25.54]So we want to have that be completely accessible.
[25:29.09]So one right here.
[25:31.25]Let's get one right here.
[25:34.43]This is just a tutorial.
[25:36.41]That'll be a fucking brilliant design.
[25:37.79]Don't worry.
[25:41.59]Guests get hungry, thirsty, and need to use the bathroom while visiting your zoo.
[25:47.21]If you don't provide them with amenities to meet these needs, they may leave prematurely and take their cash with them.
[25:55.34]Like exhibits and donation boxes.
[25:56.78]Someone's going to steal the donation box?
[26:01.62]Make sure the guests are happy, otherwise they'll sprint out of the park with... It's stuck on the bottom of that one, too.
[26:17.47]I don't know why that's happening.
[26:20.65]Uh, they may sprint out of your store with the donation box laughing the whole time.
[26:24.81]Make sure that you have pass leading to all your gray amenities.
[26:28.56]Yeah.
[26:30.64]Click on the pretzel cart.
[26:33.64]You just placed in your zoo.
[26:36.48]Oh.
[26:38.58]Oh, oh, oh, oh, pretzel cart guy for the next round, boy, I swear to God.
[26:42.56]Great, you have the pretzel cart selected.
[26:43.70]Note that an information panel opens up showing the item you have selected.
[26:47.93]Don't worry about all the things on this panel for now.
[26:49.71]We'll come back to this later.
[26:55.60]So you can pick up a building.
[26:57.44]This is to move it if you want to change where it is.
[27:03.74]Click the object.
[27:04.28]Yeah, that's fine.
[27:05.10]So we just go like this if we want to move it.
[27:08.95]Uh-huh.
[27:09.47]Yep, yep, yep.
[27:11.23]Clicking and holding the left mouse button.
[27:13.67]Okay.
[27:15.07]That makes it easier.
[27:18.10]Let me test that out.
[27:23.40]Okay, yeah.
[27:24.32]So that's how you do it.
[27:24.96]You can just move the mouse around.
[27:26.93]Alright, adopting animals.
[27:27.83]Click on the animals button to open the animal adoption tab.
[27:30.19]This is where you'll obtain animals for your zoo.
[27:32.65]Great, now let's adopt an animal.
[27:33.93]Click on the button to continue.
[27:37.72]Okay, so you can do male or female.
[27:42.34]Uh... You'll see that you already have the African elephant selected on the adoption panel.
[27:46.78]Move your mouse cursor over to the fenced area that you made earlier and place the African elephant inside of the other enclosure.
[27:54.12]And cause a huge problem.
[27:56.64]Because an elephant and a camel are gonna fight.
[28:04.64]Excellent, now you have a new animal.
[28:05.86]Guests come to see animals, so if you have no animals, you have no guests.
[28:11.16]Let them fight.
[28:12.48]No, we need to... Look.
[28:14.54]Those of you that might be new to the stream, or those of you that are old to the stream, you gotta give me, like, at least an hour or two to play the game.
[28:21.35]Because once it goes off the rails, and I start putting, like, birds inside of the elephant enclosure, and the elephants start picking birds out of the air and eating them with their trunks, I'm never gonna go back and play the game.
[28:32.45]Ever again.
[28:32.93]The way it's meant to be played.
[28:34.11]So... It's already off the rails.
[28:39.26]I'm just in the tutorial!
[28:42.62]What do you mean it's off the rails?
[28:43.80]I'm in the tutorial.
[28:45.36]I made an asphalt joke.
[28:46.64]And it was very bad.
[28:48.50]And I was corrected.
[28:52.34]I'm willing to admit when I'm incorrect and wrong about something.
[28:56.28]I was not correct.
[29:03.81]Check ass.
[29:05.91]All animals require food and water, but they won't eat just anything.
[29:08.03]Will you?
[29:08.91]That's true.
[29:10.87]Okay, how to determine what an animal eats later?
[29:12.57]Alright, so we got hay or we got water.
[29:18.17]I'm assuming we need both.
[29:20.46]Purchase food in water.
[29:22.18]Place a food trough with hay and food through with water near the African elephant by clicking on the dish and then clicking inside of the enclosure.
[29:30.68]So we can just kind of be anywhere, right?
[29:33.34]We'll do two of these and then two of these.
[29:36.70]Oh, one of those actually, that's fine.
[29:40.00]Select the animal shelters tab to open up the animal shelter panel.
[29:43.06]So here is while an exhausted animal might... What is he doing?
[29:46.34]What are you spraying with like poison?
[29:47.70]What are you?
[29:48.26]Oh, no, it's a hose.
[29:48.98]It's a portable hose.
[29:52.23]Portable hose.
[29:58.59]While an exhausted animal might just leave anywhere.
[30:01.03]Most animals require a shelter.
[30:03.41]So this is the elephant shelter.
[30:06.20]Certain advanced objects need to be studied more carefully before you have access to them.
[30:10.34]You do this by choosing to research the object.
[30:12.78]Objects that need to be researched have a small beaker appearing over their icon.
[30:17.50]Press the research button on the object.
[30:18.80]Info panel will begin research on it.
[30:19.98]I don't have it yet, so let's go ahead and research it.
[30:22.77]It costs a thousand bucks to research.
[30:25.07]Time and money.
[30:26.47]Once the research has been completed, the object is available for purchase.
[30:28.79]Click the check button.
[30:30.29]Stop reading that.
[30:31.21]Why is that even there?
[30:33.62]Wait for it to be done.
[30:35.56]Wait for your units to be ready and your RTS.
[30:37.76]Okay.
[30:38.16]Now you can place it.
[30:38.78]Alright.
[30:42.08]You can do other things while the objects are being researched.
[30:43.94]This would be a great time to take a look around the zoo.
[30:47.04]Okay.
[30:47.66]It's done.
[30:51.24]So I need to be, let's put it like, put it like in the corner right here.
[30:59.50]Alright.
[31:02.62]Animal enrichment tab.
[31:05.24]Hold on, wait.
[31:06.44]What is this?
[31:08.70]Enrichment objects enhance an exhibit area for many species of animals by keeping them active and entertained in their environment.
[31:15.76]So this is a pursuit ball.
[31:18.20]There are many enrichment objects available in Zoo Tycoon 2, but for now we'll narrow the selection down to one.
[31:24.20]An exercise ball.
[31:26.85]Alright, so let's watch him play with it.
[31:28.27]Can I play with him in here?
[31:31.68]They have different levels of interest.
[31:33.52]We'll go into more detail later about how to find out about what they do.
[31:36.28]Okay.
[31:37.57]Open the landscaping tab.
[31:39.35]Jesus.
[31:41.39]All the tools you need to create a proper habitat.
[31:43.71]Also known as a biome.
[31:45.73]Click the check.
[31:46.49]Okay.
[31:49.07]I need a Savannah biome.
[31:52.34]Savannah.
[31:53.62]Okay.
[31:55.12]So, there needs to be a Savannah in here.
[32:00.96]After you find it, move the cursor into the African Elephant's enclosure and click and drag to start painting with the land appropriate to the Savannah biome.
[32:10.19]Okay.
[32:12.59]So, like this?
[32:13.77]Does it matter?
[32:14.19]It really is painting.
[32:24.30]Are we sure?
[32:24.88]This looks like hamster spray spread stuff.
[32:30.92]Are we trying to trick the animal into thinking this is just a bag of shit that you get for your hamster?
[32:39.86]That's not the Savannah.
[32:44.80]That's a pretty big hamster.
[32:46.18]Imagine if you had one hamster in here.
[32:49.22]This is some Richie Rich asshole.
[32:52.80]Didn't that happen in that movie?
[32:53.79]He had like a little chipmunk friend and he had a giant enclosure for it.
[32:57.97]It was like CG.
[33:00.27]In the beginning of the movie, they did this elaborate like four or five minute intro sequence where he was doing like jumping and flipping around on bars and going to the ball pits and stuff.
[33:09.91]It was like a fully animated sequence.
[33:19.69]Great.
[33:20.55]If real life beckons, you can pause the game and never miss the action.
[33:23.98]Keep in mind, though, that you can also build while the game is paused.
[33:28.36]Oh, that's good.
[33:28.86]Like The Sims.
[33:30.40]It can be helpful if guests or animals move into an area where you want to build.
[33:33.82]Just pause the game and move them out of the way.
[33:36.09]Click the check button panel to continue.
[33:39.59]Hire staff.
[33:41.03]Okay.
[33:43.41]There are a lot of different workers.
[33:44.33]Okay, just like The Sims, we've got mascots, construction workers, crime, and musician.
[33:51.23]That's the only four things anyone ever does in The Sims, so that's good.
[33:57.39]maintenance, animal care, and guest education.
[34:01.67]I kind of want the dinosaur guy.
[34:06.71]Should I not have put him in there?
[34:08.03]Should I not have put like dinosaur Gumby inside of the elephant enclosure?
[34:13.60]The zookeeper staff member specializes in animal care and will make sure that your animals receive food and water as needed.
[34:19.46]It will also treat illnesses and groom dirty animals.
[34:23.32]Okay, so.
[34:25.44]I want to put, this is zookeeper staff, they specialize in animal care.
[34:32.33]Educator will enhance the educational experience for your guests.
[34:37.85]Place them somewhere.
[34:40.81]Great, you have an educator.
[34:41.61]Educators need an educator podium to speak from, otherwise the guests won't be able to hear them.
[34:46.11]Now we need to make a podium, so we need an educator podium.
[34:52.96]I almost just put, okay, I almost put down a soft drink stand.
[34:56.91]Purchase an educator podium, click on the podium, and move your mouse over to see, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:00.41]So, don't forget the green screen.
[35:03.69]Shows the position where the educator will stand to speak to the guests.
[35:07.13]So, that has to be kind of right here.
[35:13.27]They can go to work educating your guests.
[35:14.67]By educating your guests, you can increase the amount of money you receive from educational donations.
[35:20.77]Great job.
[35:21.27]This is the end of the construction tutorial.
[35:22.67]The next tutorial will teach you a few things about accessing information about your zoo.
[35:25.77]Almost done.
[35:26.75]To continue playing the next tutorial, click the check mark.
[35:28.81]Hold on.
[35:29.21]We're almost done.
[35:31.41]This is three of three.
[35:34.69]And then I'm going to install mods to make a 700-foot tall dinosaur.
[35:38.19]Okay?
[35:40.08]I'm not going to actually do that, though.
[35:45.35]See, we're leveling up in the world here.
[35:47.41]Getting information.
[35:48.97]In the following tutorial, you'll learn information about animals, staff, guests, buildings, and your zoo stats.
[35:53.39]Let's get started.
[35:54.07]Click the check.
[35:56.66]Okay.
[35:58.02]Alright, I got a question for you.
[36:00.02]Would you guys rather me continue to read these and talk, or silent for the next ten minutes and burn through this?
[36:14.65]Because I'll just like zone in and just like download this all into my brain.
[36:19.40]Alright, I'll be quiet.
[36:22.29]Here we go.
[36:56.27]Okay, see, I'm going much faster than I was before.
[37:04.65]Great, when you open the first animal ban for me, I'm on my icons in a state of the animal's needs.
[37:11.56]They have needs.
[37:14.16]What, he must, his needs are a camel?
[37:19.22]Click on the picture of the animal information panel.
[37:21.90]This enables tracking, and your camera will begin following this, so he wants to eat the camel.
[37:27.57]Oh.
[37:31.63]Okay, is this the tracking panel?
[37:32.87]Now, zooming on the selected end will get a better view.
[37:36.77]Do I not already have a good view?
[37:41.08]How is this... I mean, I got a pretty great view right now.
[37:50.99]I know you're hungry, but I...
[37:59.29]No, no, don't put him in a crate.
[38:01.15]Get him out of the crate.
[38:02.41]Get him out of the crate.
[38:07.77]What?
[38:10.01]A closer view will help you see the animal's emoticons.
[38:14.11]Emotic what?
[38:15.37]Is that a disease?
[38:17.39]Well, you know, fast forward 15, 20 years after this game came out.
[38:25.08]Some people would argue, yeah, it is.
[38:28.77]about how animals tell you about their needs, and we'll tell you more about needs in a second.
[38:33.25]When you're all through watching your animal, click the check button.
[38:37.48]Great.
[38:37.88]Time to move on to learning about the animal's needs.
[38:41.52]Satisfied need.
[38:42.36]The icons on the animal information panel represent the animal's needs.
[38:45.59]So here, just like The Sims, this is just animal Sims.
[38:48.01]I got it.
[38:50.41]Green overlay means that the need is satisfied and is all good.
[38:53.09]Click the check button.
[38:56.95]I cut so when it's yellow means they really have to they have to really have to go to the bathroom me to make an animal bathroom for them It was thirst oh no the icon shown in this story was the animals thirst when it's shown with a yellow overlay it means that the animal needs pressing this means the animal will lie on his side and you will squeeze on his stomach until the juice is pressed out of his It's human trying to satisfy this need click the check button
[39:30.29]The icon shown here represents an animal's hungry.
[39:32.79]Yeah, thirsty, hungry.
[39:34.05]I don't know what that means.
[39:37.59]Tired and needs exercise.
[39:39.48]I already know.
[39:42.36]It means that the need is critical and the animal has not been able to satisfy it.
[39:45.38]It's a good time to check your exhibit area.
[39:46.78]Make sure the right objects, in this case, the right kind of foods are available.
[39:52.75]This shows their heart rate.
[39:56.76]Here's the status.
[39:57.48]Current activity.
[39:58.14]Resting under the shade.
[39:59.50]Exiting the shade.
[40:00.56]It's just like a rollercoaster tycoon.
[40:05.54]Uh-huh.
[40:06.08]Condition that you want to be aware of.
[40:07.06]This is where you see whether an animal is ill or expecting a new addition.
[40:11.06]Oh, you can see if they're pregnant.
[40:16.70]Well, I don't... They lay eggs, so you wouldn't be pregnant.
[40:22.85]All animals lay eggs, so at least I think they do.
[40:27.56]The last tab on this panel will take you to the animal's general information.
[40:34.26]This is where we find information about the animal's gender, preferred biome, and which part of the world it originates in.
[40:38.02]Click the check button on this panel.
[40:43.08]Oh, I think my zookeeper is about to lay an egg.
[40:45.94]Okay.
[40:47.30]Get a lot of helpful information about an animal's preferences using the zookeeper recommendations panel.
[40:53.60]Okay.
[40:54.02]So the zookeeper will tell you what they need, what they want.
[40:56.82]It's pretty easy.
[40:59.93]filter to include only those that are useful to the animal you have selected.
[41:03.57]You can choose objects from this panel and place them in your zoo just as you do with the other.
[41:06.73]The buy panel is covered in the second tutorial.
[41:08.65]Check the box on this panel to close it.
[41:13.47]Many tabs on the zookeeper to see which foods, shelters, plants, trees, and enrichment objects the animal prefers.
[41:22.79]So here we go.
[41:23.27]Foods they prefer, $75 for a bunch of leaves.
[41:30.03]What the fuck?
[41:31.87]What?
[41:32.47]Oh, I got, alright, I'm good.
[41:35.57]Uh, you can use the mini tabs.
[41:38.44]You can close, uh, recommend, close the panel after this is all the stuff.
[41:42.46]Rocks, they like, they like rocks.
[41:48.00]See?
[41:49.72]They're fans of those.
[41:50.56]Alright, close that up.
[41:54.09]Locate a zookeeper in your zoo.
[41:55.21]If they're not in the middle of performing a specific task, you might find them sitting on one of your benches.
[42:00.49]They're a lot like real people after all.
[42:03.46]Otherwise, they'll be walking around tending to your exhibits.
[42:05.50]Click on a zookeeper to open the zookeeper panel.
[42:09.96]Okay.
[42:16.11]This is Keeper Van Houten.
[42:19.72]Staff status panel is where you see your zookeeper's current duty.
[42:22.96]This is what your zookeeper is doing right now.
[42:24.60]Click the check.
[42:25.14]I can't wait to have a hundred bears in the set.
[42:28.28]No, we're going too far.
[42:30.22]Slow down.
[42:33.10]Click the check button.
[42:34.64]This is the current duty.
[42:37.93]Staff assignments of your zookeeper's assignments.
[42:39.73]Okay.
[42:44.14]You can assign zookeepers to specific exhibit areas, but assigning them, they stay there.
[42:49.63]Keep them focused on the exhibits that you select.
[42:51.89]If a zookeeper does not have an assignment, they'll just head for an exhibit that needs attention.
[42:56.07]Depending on your zoo, this could mean that they do a lot of walking.
[43:00.17]That's okay.
[43:02.49]So here's how you make an assignment.
[43:05.55]Cursor turns into a flag post.
[43:06.93]Place the flag post in your zoo to assign a zookeeper to an exhibit area.
[43:09.45]When finished, right-click the mouse to clear the cursor.
[43:13.47]If you assign a zookeeper to more than one exhibit area, they may become ineffective.
[43:18.77]Click the check.
[43:20.87]Okay.
[43:21.69]So we realistically only... Just one here.
[43:25.34]So that's good.
[43:26.78]Staff thoughts.
[43:28.20]I love my job.
[43:28.94]This bench is comfortable.
[43:34.50]Yeah, man.
[43:35.50]That's pretty good.
[43:38.21]That's all you're thinking about?
[43:41.31]This is a comfortable bench.
[43:42.37]I love my job.
[43:44.37]Nothing else?
[43:46.95]That's a pretty clear mind.
[43:50.61]The staff thought panel is where you see what your staff are thinking.
[43:52.71]Here you might get a bit of insight on whether there is something standing in the way of them caring for the animals.
[43:58.06]Right.
[43:59.48]Staff salary.
[44:00.36]This is where you see the salary, how long they've been employed.
[44:05.14]$500 a month to be a zookeeper.
[44:10.70]Well, at least he loves that bench.
[44:17.12]Select a guest.
[44:17.86]Let's move on to the guests.
[44:21.75]Uh, kid?
[44:22.31]Should we do kid or adult?
[44:27.19]How about Grillmaster Rex BBQ?
[44:30.47]The guest activities and needs panel shows you what the guest is currently doing.
[44:35.65]Okay, yeah.
[44:36.67]Guest needs.
[44:39.75]I need a screen that's satisfied.
[44:40.91]If it's yellow, it's pressing.
[44:41.95]And if it's red, it's critical.
[44:45.29]Going to buy the soda.
[44:48.42]Chat.
[44:48.90]It's fucking chat.
[44:56.52]Why does chat have to appear in every video game?
[45:00.09]This is like 15 years ago.
[45:04.82]Alright, this is the status tab.
[45:05.90]This is hungry, hunger needs, thirst, rest, amusement, bathroom, yeah, of course.
[45:15.05]Uh, slick gas, whoa, this guy's loaded.
[45:17.11]This guy has in his bank account the amount of money that this guy, my zookeeper, makes in a month.
[45:25.50]Jesus.
[45:26.66]That's a lot, is that like a lot of money in this universe?
[45:30.83]On this panel you can see how much cash to get.
[45:32.96]NileCrocodile1 has been put in a crate.
[45:35.90]Why?
[45:36.86]What did he do?
[45:37.38]I don't know what that means yet.
[45:40.74]If a guest has purchased a souvenir in your zoo, click the check button.
[45:46.84]Click on the guest favorites tab.
[45:50.17]They really like camels.
[45:51.55]Okay.
[45:53.82]Guest favorite animal.
[45:54.40]Guests are likely to make larger donations if they see their favorite animals.
[45:57.48]So stay on top of your guest favorites.
[45:58.95]You'll reap the reward of money coming in from donations.
[46:03.73]And guest thoughts.
[46:06.51]You can see, don't you wish you could read everyone's mind this way?
[46:09.02]Not really.
[46:09.58]I really don't.
[46:12.17]I do not wish I could read everybody's mind.
[46:14.82]Because, imagine if you could do that.
[46:16.50]Imagine, like, just shaking somebody's hand at the bank.
[46:19.78]Like, oh, yeah, I'm Banker One.
[46:21.41]Oh, hi, I'm Guy.
[46:22.75]I'm Guy One.
[46:23.83]Oh, nice to meet you.
[46:24.63]And you can read his mind.
[46:25.85]I don't like your nose.
[46:26.41]Your nose is ugly.
[46:27.23]It's just like, what the fuck?
[46:28.39]And then you can't even talk to the guy anymore.
[46:32.09]Or like, oh, I'm welcome to the bank.
[46:34.15]How are you doing?
[46:34.69]Like, I'm going to shit my pants.
[46:37.17]I would laugh.
[46:37.93]How would you be able to do anything?
[46:39.81]Nothing would ever work.
[46:40.85]You would never be able to have a conversation ever again.
[46:48.68]If I could read people's minds, I wouldn't.
[46:50.18]No, that's a power I don't want.
[46:55.16]Alright, so we need to hope the small restroom one line moves quickly.
[46:58.42]I really need to use the bathroom.
[46:59.62]I need to throw away this trash.
[47:01.10]I prefer something other than soda.
[47:05.26]I want something other than soda.
[47:08.08]All we got is soda.
[47:09.83]We just have Pepsi.
[47:11.97]That's it.
[47:12.29]Alright, select a food stand.
[47:16.69]Yeah, buildings have information as well.
[47:20.79]Which, where are the food stands?
[47:25.82]Right here.
[47:26.08]That's a pretty good zoo setup.
[47:31.22]Here's a status panel.
[47:32.34]It's how much money things are.
[47:33.72]Yep.
[47:35.74]Items being sold.
[47:38.14]Some buildings may display slightly different information.
[47:41.54]Finance tab.
[47:42.45]Let's see how much it is.
[47:43.29]So this is price low, moderate, or high prices.
[47:49.89]This is the balance sheet, which I will always be in the red for.
[47:53.91]Show whether it's turning a profit or not.
[47:55.43]Yep.
[47:57.63]Get a complete overview about how your zoo is doing from the zoo status page.
[48:00.28]Here's the money tab.
[48:01.18]This is going to just, yeah, it's how much money you spent versus how much you've received.
[48:07.10]Mark your zoo as open or closed.
[48:08.74]This is how you open the zoo.
[48:09.94]That's actually really good to know.
[48:16.19]An altered level of your admission prices.
[48:18.94]So wait, it costs money to come in and people are expected to give a bunch of money?
[48:26.81]Oh, I thought it was, okay.
[48:31.76]When you close the zoo, all your guests will begin to leave.
[48:33.70]Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[48:36.74]Income and expenses tab.
[48:39.77]A monthly tally of your financial comings and goings.
[48:41.85]If you're seeing lots of red, your zoo is probably spending more than it's receiving.
[48:44.76]Remember, green is good.
[48:46.42]And this is one place where you don't want to be looking through rose-colored glasses.
[48:51.22]Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[48:55.00]Zoo fame.
[48:57.09]Shows you how many animals you have, how happy people are.
[48:59.25]There's an award ceremony probably at the end of the year, like in every single one of these video games.
[49:03.53]You can mouse over them.
[49:07.38]Uh, the more animals you have in your zoo, the more famous it becomes.
[49:09.68]Animal happiness, guest education... Releasing animals into the wild will increase fame for your zoo!
[49:15.20]Uh... Does that mean, like, open the gates to the elephant enclosure and just watch what happens?
[49:21.63]I mean, of course your zoo would be famous.
[49:27.07]Hey, I'm Relisha!
[49:28.85]I'm the omnipotent owner of the zoo!
[49:33.27]Here's like the nuclear launch code to unlock all the doors.
[49:37.10]I'll be so famous.
[49:40.70]Alright.
[49:41.16]Zoo quick stats.
[49:45.28]This shows pretty much everything here.
[49:47.98]Illnesses can be very helpful in giving you an overview.
[49:51.99]So crocodile one.
[49:53.33]Uh-oh.
[49:54.39]This represents the animal's current privacy.
[49:56.67]Animals can use shelters or lie in grass or shade to regain their privacy as more guests view them.
[50:03.87]The crocodile wants more privacy.
[50:05.74]This is gonna be fun.
[50:07.88]Alright, there's a guest list that shows everybody all the things.
[50:10.04]Can't wait to see some animals.
[50:13.34]The camera will jump to that person if you click on it.
[50:15.59]And track the movements of the animal the person's selecting.
[50:17.25]Hmm, maybe another one of those don't-you-wish-you-could things.
[50:20.75]Why do you want this?
[50:22.65]What the fuck are you talking about?
[50:23.69]The guy that wrote the tutorial.
[50:27.38]You want to read everybody's mind and track everyone.
[50:32.71]Did Mark Zuckerberg make this game?
[50:41.60]Eventually, you know, his superpower... ...started to become a reality.
[50:52.49]We got information on staff.
[50:53.85]You can see what everybody wants.
[50:58.36]Whereabouts have you stopped in the zoo?
[51:00.34]Camera will jump to their location and over there, Stamp information will show what you can do.
[51:03.49]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[51:05.07]Waiting for job, waiting for job, waiting for job.
[51:06.99]What the hell was that?
[51:10.63]What just fucking flashed by my screen?
[51:15.35]Okay.
[51:16.43]Alright.
[51:17.57]I think we're ready.
[51:19.15]It's time to learn more about the photo safari.
[51:22.04]Photo mode.
[51:23.68]You can take pictures in the dial, yeah.
[51:27.27]When a photo challenge is available, you can right-click to view the challenge.
[51:32.49]Take a picture of a dromedary camel.
[51:37.23]This challenge asks you to take a picture of a dromedary camel.
[51:40.22]Think you're up for the challenge.
[51:43.66]You can walk around using the left mouse button of the moving key.
[51:45.78]Locate a camel in your zoo.
[51:47.66]You can adjust the zoom of your camera in and out using the wheel.
[51:50.00]Alright.
[51:50.30]What are you doing?
[51:55.40]What the hell are you doing?
[51:59.22]Was that kid just like going to the- was that- were you just like pissing over there?
[52:02.15]Hey!
[52:02.67]Not allowed.
[52:26.59]You fucking idiot.
[52:27.47]Why'd you move?
[52:28.09]That was a good photo.
[52:34.67]Take a photo of, yeah, that was... This way you can take another look at the picture that you took for the photo challenge.
[52:41.74]Right click, photo challenge.
[52:43.40]Got it.
[52:44.78]You can view any of the photographs you've ever taken by opening your photo album tab.
[52:49.52]I don't recommend doing this on stream.
[52:51.93]Why?
[52:53.93]For the photo, the photos that you've just taken are shown in the film strip below the top of the screen.
[53:00.49]You can click and drag them into empty slots in your photo album.
[53:07.50]Okay.
[53:17.31]30 animals, 10 different boomers, hundreds of objects, and more.
[53:21.43]Be sure to refer to the Zoo Tycoon 2 manual for even more in-depth information.
[53:26.47]Tutorials are marked with the book icon.
[53:27.95]I'm ready.
[53:28.61]Let's do it.
[53:33.96]Okay!
[53:35.44]Here we go!
[53:38.21]Welcome to the stream, everybody!
[53:40.01]I feel like I have to run on a stage.
[53:46.93]And start, like, screaming and pointing into the audience.
[53:50.78]It's been an hour?
[53:51.46]It's been... Holy shit, it's been an hour.
[53:53.52]Whatever.
[53:54.72]We're ready.
[53:55.22]Play... We start with the campaign?
[54:10.68]Oh, fuck.
[54:12.92]This is so... This is like... It's 10.
[54:14.90]This is like probably 10 tutorials.
[54:21.22]Do sand... I don't know how to fucking play.
[54:23.94]Sandbox game?
[54:24.92]Oh, god.
[54:33.17]I'm not ready for this.
[54:38.65]I'm not ready for this.
[54:39.41]No.
[54:42.98]Let's get away with no tutorial.
[54:45.77]Zookeeper in training.
[54:47.43]See?
[54:47.61]You have a great opportunity to take over a small zoo, but you need to prove that you understand that animals have individual biome needs.
[54:54.51]Make sure each animal is moved into its appropriate biome exhibit and run your new zoo for one month.
[54:59.94]Complete all scenarios in this campaign and you'll get like 50 times somebody's income.
[55:10.06]I need to understand.
[55:11.12]You will play and you'll like it.
[55:13.06]Just wait.
[55:13.56]I need to... Let me just get... Let me just ease into the game.
[55:19.14]$30,000 a month.
[55:23.62]Just let me do this first.
[55:24.66]I need to... I can't just jump into sandbox mode.
[55:29.33]Look, I need to learn the very basics of like color and paint and canvases.
[55:35.60]Don't just dump the most expensive tools into my backyard and say, I expect the Mona Lisa in 10 minutes.
[55:42.83]I don't even know what RGB means.
[55:45.61]What does it even stand for?
[55:49.88]Alright, ground attorney took over a small local zoo.
[55:53.12]However, the current owner wants to be sure that you understand that animals have individual needs.
[55:57.06]He's provided you with three animals that need to be placed in their appropriate biome exhibit.
[56:01.49]Each animal can be found in a crate near the front entrance of your zoo.
[56:03.87]When you select the crate, the information panel indicates what kind of animal is inside.
[56:07.47]Pick up the crate and move it like any other object.
[56:09.97]To release an animal from its crate, click on crate.
[56:12.35]You need to move and release each animal.
[56:13.55]Yeah, yeah.
[56:13.85]To verify, you can handle the basics.
[56:15.25]You've also been tasked to run the zoo for one month and ensure the animals survive.
[56:17.99]Tip, in the interest of keeping your animals alive, you want to provide them with food and water.
[56:24.96]I don't understand.
[56:26.02]Do things need to eat and drink?
[56:29.92]Release each animal from its crate and place an appropriate exhibit.
[56:32.56]I've got 15 minutes to do this.
[56:35.11]Okay.
[56:36.37]I accept the challenge.
[56:38.73]Here we go.
[56:39.65]Welcome to Zoo Tycoon 2.
[56:40.83]Where are those crates?
[57:03.78]They said at the entrance, right?
[57:10.55]Oh, here are the three animals.
[57:11.69]Okay.
[57:12.15]How do I grab... Where's the music?
[57:31.20]Um... Okay, this is a hippopotamus and needs to be in...
[57:39.32]A wetlands biome.
[57:43.67]No, no, no, go back in.
[57:48.15]So, this looks pretty wet over here.
[57:49.49]Let's not just drop him in the ocean.
[57:52.55]Alright, here we go.
[57:53.16]This looks pretty.
[57:53.64]This is wetlands right here.
[58:00.58]Okay.
[58:01.68]Looks good.
[58:02.20]Let's uncreate the hippopotamus.
[58:06.73]I hope you like your new area.
[58:09.85]We got, this is a polar bear.
[58:11.51]It needs to be in a tundra.
[58:17.82]Which is right here.
[58:26.20]And we need to put the lion into the Savannah.
[58:32.36]I did it.
[58:33.20]Polar bear needs more space.
[58:34.76]What?
[58:36.30]Run the zoo for one month and ensure that you have all three animals in your zoo at the end of the month.
[58:40.63]What do you mean he needs more space?
[58:45.45]You have the biggest exhibit here.
[58:46.73]This is enough for like 25 polar bears.
[58:50.77]Alright, you're good.
[58:52.65]Let's open the zoo.
[58:55.16]The zoo is open.
[58:56.94]I'm ready to make this first challenge.
[58:58.66]And then we can move on to the more difficult tasks.
[59:00.94]Alright, so we need buildings.
[59:01.74]I want to get... We need... Educator podium.
[59:09.04]Right at the beginning here.
[59:11.52]Now release them.
[59:13.26]I'm not gonna release the animals!
[59:18.09]Look, I need to make the person in the video game that you walk by in the first five to ten minutes of the story, and it's the guy sitting there preaching in front of the first, like, after the first cutscene that you walk by.
[59:32.41]Right there.
[59:35.02]Okay, we need an educator.
[59:39.94]There's one person.
[59:41.36]Jeremy Elbertson.
[59:43.18]Holy shit, that was close.
[59:47.10]Alright, what do you need?
[59:48.76]I can't wait to see some animals going right for the hippopotamus.
[59:55.61]Alright, two guests now.
[59:56.67]How much is this place?
[60:04.15]Okay, how much is it?
[60:05.07]$50.
[60:06.13]No, it's...
[60:09.16]Just make it 20 bucks.
[60:14.35]Okay, here's Jim Ben Dixon.
[60:17.49]Wants to see a Warthog.
[60:20.75]Hold on a minute here.
[60:22.15]Warthog.
[60:24.83]Do I have access to Warthog?
[60:29.90]Velociraptor!
[60:31.94]Why would a Velociraptor be here right now?
[61:00.28]He's gonna take a shit in the corn.
[61:04.68]He's gonna kill guests.
[61:06.88]No, I'll take care of this!
[61:09.54]Hey!
[61:13.28]Get outta here!
[61:26.37]Oh, he wants to go in.
[61:27.19]You wanna go in there?
[61:29.70]No, you can't go in there yet.
[61:31.53]There's nothing in there.
[61:34.85]He wants to go in and eat the hippopotamus.
[61:39.09]Hold on.
[61:44.52]Where is it?
[61:55.28]Does that help?
[61:56.79]Where is he going?
[61:57.67]Uh-oh.
[61:59.84]There's one random guy.
[62:04.87]Come on in and see our new mascot, the Velociraptor.
[62:13.37]This biome is not suitable for Velociraptor 1.
[62:15.89]What's he thinking about?
[62:22.97]Family tree.
[62:23.73]No family tree yet.
[62:28.60]Alright, well, I...
[62:45.99]I told you I can't go off the rails yet.
[62:47.73]Get rid of the raptor.
[62:48.86]What do I do?
[62:55.40]How do I get rid of him?
[63:04.53]Hold on.
[63:04.87]Why is there no audio?
[63:07.35]There's no audio in this game.
[63:09.23]Alright.
[63:16.26]There's no guns in this game.
[63:18.90]Line one is not contained.
[63:20.12]What do you mean line one is not contained?
[63:23.38]Oh, wait.
[63:25.68]I deleted the fence.
[63:29.46]Uh-oh.
[63:29.92]Uh-oh.
[63:32.02]He's figuring it out.
[63:32.96]I guess I can walk through here.
[63:42.30]Where's he going?
[63:43.40]Where's he going?
[63:45.50]Oh no.
[63:46.82]Oh shit.
[63:47.82]He's sprinting.
[63:49.44]Who is he sprinting?
[63:50.14]This guy's got to shit his pants.
[63:52.36]He's in the line.
[63:53.20]I can smell it.
[63:59.00]I need to turn the fucking audio up.
[64:06.96]Paul Laverre is hungry.
[64:08.06]Alright.
[64:19.38]Delete game.
[64:22.58]Whatever, save game.
[64:31.75]Oh, the whole game closed.
[64:36.39]I need to, like, turn the sound up.
[64:38.81]All you can hear is every so often you hear...
[64:48.87]Alright, I'll get in the sandbox.
[64:50.25]I know how the game works.
[64:51.61]Okay, well here it comes.
[64:56.26]Hopefully it's not loud when you hear this.
[65:00.04]It probably will be though, so just brace yourself.
[65:10.69]I told you, I knew it.
[65:12.37]I fucking knew it.
[65:13.45]I tried to warn you.
[65:24.63]That's better.
[65:25.41]That's actually kind of loud.
[65:27.47]That's too loud now.
[65:28.41]40 and, like, 43.
[65:38.27]35, 38.
[65:38.47]Alright.
[65:43.89]Let's play... I don't know how to take care of dinosaurs, but I'll figure it out.
[65:53.60]How about, no, let's go... What's wrong with the world right now?
[66:00.52]What does this take place?
[66:02.52]Half the world is underwater.
[66:06.30]Oh shit.
[66:10.38]Is this like post-apocalyptic?
[66:19.63]This is what's left.
[66:21.27]One giant road through Russia.
[66:30.88]Filters.
[66:33.06]Alright, let's do... We can't just go right to the extinct animals.
[66:42.55]We'll do medium.
[66:46.49]Medium in Western Europe.
[66:49.24]Let me just do something normal.
[66:50.54]You know what I mean?
[66:51.58]No dinosaurs, no aliens.
[67:02.13]Okay, here we go.
[67:03.95]Time to make my park.
[67:07.81]I don't like this place.
[67:12.31]This is like a 2007 World of Warcraft zone.
[67:15.49]I don't want to do this one.
[67:20.07]Alright, well, whatever.
[67:21.17]Let's just... We'll work with what we've got.
[67:24.93]Start the process.
[67:26.33]Landscaping.
[67:27.09]I want... Let's get some paths here.
[67:33.71]No, no, no.
[67:34.23]I want a path.
[67:36.40]There's so many people parked out here waiting for this to open.
[67:42.78]What was the pathing tool?
[67:44.48]Right here.
[67:45.46]Okay.
[67:46.24]So, asphalt path...
[67:49.22]We're going to just simply... I'm going to follow the tutorial here.
[67:52.39]I'm going to expand up there later.
[67:54.81]That looks good.
[67:59.79]Alright.
[68:00.31]And then we're going to come across this way.
[68:07.23]We're going to have small exhibits.
[68:10.37]Small, not huge.
[68:11.85]This is going to have rabbits in here.
[68:14.91]If you think I'm going to put lions and polar bears, no.
[68:16.81]We're going to have goats, rabbits, and then a couple of pigs.
[68:30.28]This is going to be essentially the part of the county fair that you go to that has the shitty pumpkin contest and then the random pigs.
[68:41.47]Oh, whoops.
[68:44.50]How do I- how do I delete you?
[68:47.96]Um, this is not- how are people gonna get up there?
[68:52.72]That's so ugly.
[68:53.60]What have I done?
[69:02.39]What's the- what's the bulldoze button?
[69:03.77]There it is.
[69:09.27]Okay.
[69:10.01]That's better.
[69:14.96]But Jerma, that sign's not, it's not exact!
[69:17.82]That's fine, whatever, we just make like a fucking spatula.
[69:23.29]I'll move this one over.
[69:30.53]Now it'll be fine, everyone can relax.
[69:38.45]So that means it needs to be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[69:39.89]So we need 1, 2, we need 1, 2, 3, 4.
[69:41.01]1, 2, 3, 4.
[69:41.17]Oh, fuck me.
[69:43.63]Well, Juba, you did a good job, man.
[70:09.94]Could I pick a shittier level?
[70:11.82]I just picked a random place in Europe.
[70:15.65]Let's start with the amenities.
[70:18.87]Extinct research lab.
[70:21.73]Entertainer stage.
[70:22.89]Absolutely.
[70:25.42]Well, this is a dinosaur one, though.
[70:32.39]So, how we're gonna make this is... You have to cross this path.
[70:37.91]So you're gonna get... Bang, bang, there's no way to go around it.
[70:43.52]You have to go like this.
[70:45.04]And there's gonna be a donation box, donation box.
[70:53.54]We're gonna start the donation process the second you enter.
[70:59.93]So we got... I need to read... Hold on a minute.
[71:02.98]Dino Capture Team Bunker.
[71:09.08]What?
[71:11.82]What the hell is that?
[71:17.75]Sabertooth Tiger.
[71:19.77]Paleontologist.
[71:20.75]We have to have the Dinosaur Entertainer here.
[71:24.00]How am I going to have on one stage?
[71:30.82]We have to make an entire ensemble children's television show cast.
[71:44.82]That's all you do.
[71:45.56]You just dance forever.
[71:54.88]Coming up next on Disney Junior.
[71:58.19]The dinosaur troupe.
[72:07.97]Alright, so that's fine.
[72:09.77]Why are they running around wild?
[72:12.51]You know what?
[72:13.47]You're fired.
[72:16.56]You're fired.
[72:18.64]You're fired.
[72:20.04]You're fired.
[72:20.54]Anyone that gets off that stage is fired.
[72:33.28]We found the one employee.
[72:36.48]That was a test.
[72:39.42]That was a test.
[72:40.46]To find out who really was dedicated.
[72:45.34]It's you.
[72:48.59]Dinosaur Kimmy.
[72:51.33]And that means you get a raise.
[72:52.35]I don't think I can.
[72:54.77]How do I... I can't raise.
[72:58.45]I love my job.
[72:59.16]I hope the crowd likes my show.
[73:00.36]It's time to do a show.
[73:07.81]That park didn't even open yet.
[73:09.66]Alright.
[73:12.50]Hold on.
[73:17.30]Why did that happen?
[73:19.66]Why am I in water now?
[73:21.50]Oh, okay.
[73:23.48]Alright, now we need, uh... No, stop running away!
[73:27.37]Whatever, you'll figure it out.
[73:28.67]Transportation?
[73:29.25]We can do jeeps?
[73:31.21]Jeep vehicle station.
[73:32.73]Are you serious?
[73:34.23]Where did you come from?
[73:34.99]Hold on, did that person just trade?
[73:37.68]We're gonna have a Jeep.
[73:38.76]It's too much.
[73:39.30]Hold on.
[73:43.06]And you get in here.
[73:47.94]Jeep vehicle station.
[73:51.02]Oh, I gotta get rid of this.
[73:56.48]Alright.
[73:58.79]So then now, crossing gate road.
[74:03.27]Click to select, then place a crossing gate which keeps pedestrians from crossing a road where a Jeep is.
[74:10.32]Hold on there.
[74:14.22]Which allows Jeep vehicles to enter and exit animal exhibits.
[74:16.92]Holy shit.
[74:25.01]This is gonna be so boring.
[74:31.55]No, undo.
[74:46.24]Oh, come on, man.
[74:48.64]I'm trying to move... I'm trying to move this.
[74:59.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[75:02.10]Why?
[75:02.82]What?
[75:11.33]Okay.
[75:12.47]Here we go.
[75:27.57]feed that.
[75:28.71]Just absolutely.
[75:29.91]I mean, give people a chance.
[75:34.44]Alright, Jeep transportation circuit is complete.
[75:42.24]Alright, so let's put in... We gotta have at least one.
[75:49.99]Alright, here we go.
[76:01.50]I don't think I can put one here.
[76:05.29]This is going to get so backed up.
[76:08.67]This ride's going to take forever.
[76:16.59]Two strands of Sky Team cable?
[76:20.20]What?
[76:20.66]You can do a cable car too?
[76:25.84]This is just a lawsuit.
[76:26.88]We just need to see what happens.
[76:29.76]Alright.
[76:31.54]Uh, so... You get to do dinosaurs running around in circles.
[76:35.26]Tank building.
[76:38.76]Wall for water.
[76:41.35]This is why I didn't want all the painter's tools.
[76:44.93]This is why I didn't want all the tools at once.
[76:47.11]Alright, let's make some, uh, let's make some habitats.
[76:54.38]So this is gonna be...
[76:57.29]Let's get a... Okay.
[76:59.11]Fence.
[77:00.92]This is Chaelic Fence.
[77:01.78]We want a tight budget.
[77:04.66]I mean, we're not, but that's fine.
[77:08.44]Let's go here.
[77:09.12]That looks good.
[77:18.97]Get an entrance.
[77:25.20]Another... Let's just do chain link fence for now.
[77:32.36]Oh, whoops.
[77:34.98]This has to go down to here.
[77:41.93]That's enough room for a half of a chimpanzee.
[77:45.73]Well, that's fine, because it's not the right climate.
[77:51.80]These are tiny, but that's for the gerbil.
[77:58.19]Look, I'm just trying to... This isn't set in stone yet, okay?
[78:05.79]I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing.
[78:13.42]We can make habitats.
[78:22.04]Staff members, there you go.
[78:23.98]AHHHHH!
[78:28.58]Just directionless.
[78:33.40]Absolutely no direction.
[78:36.03]Doesn't know what time it is, doesn't know what day it is.
[78:42.51]Doesn't know the last time.
[78:43.61]I told you.
[78:49.79]I told you.
[78:51.19]I can't see in the suit that well.
[78:55.94]He's just running into shit.
[79:01.54]He doesn't have eye holes.
[79:03.27]What is he doing?
[79:04.67]He's just panicking.
[79:08.37]I only know how to do one thing!
[79:10.81]Might as well do the one thing I know!
[79:11.96]Look at that sweat mark.
[79:19.00]Okay, so we need a couple more of these habitats.
[79:30.75]Do I need somebody to drive?
[79:32.02]Okay, there we go.
[79:33.84]Now, animals.
[79:34.56]Let's see what we got.
[79:36.44]Armadillo.
[79:37.20]I mean, that's a fucking cool animal.
[79:39.44]We need small animals.
[79:41.12]Beaver.
[79:43.76]Beaver would work.
[79:46.95]I need rabbits.
[79:50.87]Here, what's this?
[79:52.25]A fox?
[79:52.91]That's a little too big.
[79:58.85]Oh, there's turkeys.
[79:59.67]Okay.
[80:00.99]Maybe a bunch of turkeys.
[80:04.81]Penguins.
[80:10.10]There's so many different animals.
[80:11.40]Alright, let's start small.
[80:19.42]Because I was supposed to start small.
[80:23.99]Ostrich.
[80:25.25]No... Beaver.
[80:27.27]We need something a little... Fox is fine.
[80:28.81]Fox is a little.
[80:29.75]They don't need that much space.
[80:33.75]A water-loving rodent from North America needs... Wetlands biome.
[80:41.67]Okay.
[80:42.81]So let's make wetlands biome.
[80:47.01]We need wetlands.
[80:50.78]That's going to be the main attraction, by the way.
[80:59.56]And this is going to make some water.
[81:01.44]Make shallow water over here.
[81:05.64]And then make it a little deep.
[81:08.82]Make it shallow in the ends.
[81:09.84]Oops!
[81:10.25]Okay.
[81:16.19]Alright, looks good.
[81:20.31]Deep, shallow, and then dirt.
[81:22.69]We need, let's go like that.
[81:24.67]Alright.
[81:25.33]Putting our first animal in the exhibit.
[81:28.81]American beaver.
[81:30.47]An American beaver in Europe.
[81:33.95]There's too many.
[81:44.76]You're fired.
[81:48.16]They need more space.
[82:06.01]No, don't let him out.
[82:19.40]Okay.
[82:21.10]Now we just got to get rid of these fences here and extend the habitat.
[82:26.45]Don't go over here yet, guys.
[82:34.18]Okay, habitat.
[82:35.47]Wetlands.
[82:37.31]Ah!
[82:38.73]I know, don't worry.
[82:42.79]That's not enough space for you?
[82:58.70]How is there a guest in here?
[83:00.98]How did you get in here?
[83:03.48]Why are you angry?
[83:04.14]Who the fuck are you?
[83:08.46]This park's not even open.
[83:14.04]It doesn't look like American Beaver has enough space.
[83:16.12]American Beaver looks unhappy.
[83:17.32]I'm going home.
[83:28.31]This park is... Did you let... Is this like the dinosaur's family?
[83:31.83]No, it's closed.
[83:32.51]Get out of here.
[83:35.07]One of these idiots opened the park.
[83:36.31]Okay, hold on.
[83:41.69]Let's get some food here.
[83:45.77]Animal food for a beaver.
[83:47.82]I need... Oh, wait.
[83:49.82]I need a zookeeper.
[83:54.88]Let's get a couple of zookeepers.
[83:58.20]Why the fuck are you running away?
[84:00.27]How do you need more space than this?
[84:05.22]Okay, food.
[84:06.26]What does a beaver eat?
[84:07.18]I need to, like, click on their tab here.
[84:12.74]Alright.
[84:14.59]Uh... Space is critical.
[84:16.81]What are you doing?
[84:17.29]Are you breaking up shit in the bottom?
[84:19.49]Are they dead?
[84:22.71]Why are they lying down?
[84:24.61]Are they breaking shit up on the bottom of the ocean?
[84:35.75]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[84:37.25]Deep water.
[84:47.78]That's not deep enough?
[84:52.76]The zoo only has beavers.
[84:53.84]Well, the zoo only has beavers because it... Are they angry with me?
[85:02.62]This one's happy.
[85:04.10]Alright, we need food.
[85:06.84]Uh, we need branches, so we're gonna put, like, branches here.
[85:13.13]Uh... Hollow log with lettuce.
[85:15.01]Oh, they're all going for it.
[85:16.33]Quick!
[85:16.97]It's a race to get the food.
[85:19.64]Who's the alpha beaver?
[85:26.12]Uh... Lettuce pile.
[85:28.06]There we go.
[85:30.50]See another happy.
[85:34.07]Food dish.
[85:42.50]They really are fighting each other.
[85:43.72]Alright, they need more space, though.
[85:47.84]Is this gonna be just a beaver zoo?
[85:53.37]Look, pile of branches.
[85:54.71]You guys can, like, play over here.
[85:59.31]Animal shelters.
[85:59.93]They don't need an animal shelter.
[86:01.17]They... They need more land.
[86:08.80]Okay, well, I'll take down this shit, then.
[86:11.64]You need more land?
[86:12.46]Pause the game.
[86:13.74]I'll give you more land.
[86:35.40]I got complaints now.
[86:38.62]Then I'm going to be very upset.
[86:41.28]Wetlands.
[86:41.88]Let's go with the grass.
[86:43.08]Let's extend the big pool.
[86:49.99]Let's do... Let's get shallow water this way.
[86:59.22]Because then I'll do deep here so they can at least hang out over there.
[87:08.58]Oh, this stupid fucking thing's in the way.
[87:11.85]Okay.
[87:16.57]Shallow water.
[87:17.25]American Brewery is not contained.
[87:20.57]Well, the game's paused.
[87:21.65]Everything's fine.
[87:25.73]Alright, here we go.
[87:26.41]We need to get this one closed in.
[87:30.86]And then this needs to be closed in.
[87:37.04]Why did I even build this?
[87:39.98]The road thing.
[87:41.44]I'm like a child.
[87:44.21]I had to make it.
[87:44.99]Alright, that's enclosed.
[87:50.15]I'm ready to turn it back on.
[87:53.21]Let's get some food in here for them.
[87:57.52]Okay, Mr. Ranger, we've got... Let's put some...
[88:05.60]rocks let's give them a couple of rocks that's too big of a rock that's also too big of a rock just get like two or three like dinosaur droppings over here for you to play with uh plants alright uh a little log that I'm sure they're gonna love that and then let's get some toys this doesn't go in the water it goes just like running the edge here we'll put one down here
[88:34.82]Uh, Misty Spring.
[88:37.50]That's a huge log.
[88:41.85]Beavers love logs.
[88:42.85]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[88:44.39]Right in the corner here.
[88:45.11]And we need, I think we need more food.
[88:51.27]Hollow log with lettuce.
[88:52.55]Yeah, we'll put the, that's like a little snack for them over here.
[88:54.61]Alright, no more complaints.
[89:05.17]Why do they sound like pigs?
[89:07.87]Alright, can I see?
[89:08.63]What do you need?
[89:10.37]Comfortable the animal is.
[89:12.43]Hygiene needs.
[89:14.99]Alright, we're good.
[89:17.23]This is just barely big enough for them, by the way.
[89:20.02]How?
[89:21.90]Social needs.
[89:24.58]They need to be social with other animals.
[89:28.68]Current simulation level.
[89:32.28]They'll spread out.
[89:34.24]Expand.
[89:36.08]But I can't expand.
[89:37.30]This is not going to be Beaver Park.
[89:43.29]This is a great exhibit right here.
[89:48.09]How are you not contained?
[89:49.23]You're in here.
[89:51.41]Social.
[89:56.19]What's your problem?
[89:58.29]Put it up for adoption.
[90:01.41]I need more fresh trees.
[90:06.71]Alright, let's put in some fresh trees.
[90:10.61]Where's the ranger?
[90:11.23]I need ranger to tell me, uh, some help me here.
[90:13.75]Alright, American beaver.
[90:14.59]Uh, tree.
[90:18.31]Alright, here we go.
[90:21.00]They're gonna have to get, you get one, two trees, and that should be good.
[90:36.04]They're all females.
[90:37.22]What?
[90:37.38]What do you mean they're all female?
[90:46.53]I only put in females?
[90:48.07]Oh, fuck.
[90:53.41]Uh... God, no.
[91:08.02]That's it, and that was enough to make it... Fine.
[91:12.16]I just deleted a beaver.
[91:21.74]I think I just killed a beaver.
[91:23.82]I just killed a beaver, I think.
[91:32.24]They're gonna kill each other.
[91:34.26]No, they're not.
[91:36.76]This is part one.
[91:39.20]I'm going to delete this stupid fucking thing and that's going to make more room.
[91:42.42]I'll put some food and drinks down here.
[91:47.26]Over here is going to be the entrance with dinosaurs.
[91:48.64]There's going to be two dinosaur dancers.
[91:50.61]And then we're going to go up.
[91:51.35]We're going to take a little monorail up this way.
[91:54.21]It's not just going to be Beaver Park.
[92:00.75]It's the Beaver Park for the first five seconds.
[92:06.18]Oh, fuck.
[92:14.93]Contain it.
[92:15.49]Just contain it.
[92:18.95]I build this later.
[92:19.83]American Beaver is not contained.
[92:27.48]It will be very soon.
[92:30.12]Okay, here we go.
[92:31.54]Let's actually get this built.
[92:34.74]And then I'm gonna do extend the water, and then I'm gonna have a little island over here for them to hang out.
[92:39.85]And on the island is gonna be a fucking grizzly bear.
[92:42.91]So, good luck, beavers.
[92:45.41]No, no, no.
[92:47.29]No.
[92:48.39]No, that's not gonna happen.
[92:52.20]Hey, you know how they're always gonna go off the rails in the first, like, hour?
[92:56.16]I don't know what happened with that.
[92:58.80]Oh, this is too far.
[93:06.79]Right here.
[93:08.07]Right here.
[93:10.23]Is that enough?
[93:11.59]How many beavers do I have?
[93:14.86]I haven't even checked that.
[93:18.14]Wetlands.
[93:19.58]Click to include plants?
[93:24.60]Oh, wait.
[93:24.86]I can... Oh, hold on a minute here.
[93:29.82]Oh!
[93:29.94]It does it automatically.
[93:31.14]Would you look at that?
[93:33.30]See?
[93:33.44]See?
[93:38.63]But we need water.
[93:42.95]It's making little lily pads for them.
[93:47.79]I want like a little hangout zone here though.
[93:54.13]Like they can come over to the other shore.
[93:55.47]They can swim to the other shore.
[93:56.34]Alright, let's put food over here.
[94:01.26]What is this thing?
[94:01.78]Nah, I don't want to do that.
[94:06.50]Let's get some food over here.
[94:11.38]Needs more space.
[94:12.26]You'll get it in a second.
[94:13.18]How about... Let's put some food dish with roots.
[94:18.74]How many do we have?
[94:19.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[94:22.42]There's like 14.
[94:22.96]Or like 15.
[94:23.28]Let's go... See?
[94:23.74]Look at that.
[94:24.12]And...
[94:41.32]And there's going to be a fun log over here.
[94:47.47]They're enclosed, right?
[94:50.51]What do you say now?
[95:12.34]They need more space.
[95:25.20]Move triangle.
[95:25.91]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[95:27.05]I'm gonna remove the triangle.
[95:28.29]They need more space.
[95:35.09]How many are in here?
[95:46.10]Alright, I'm sorry.
[95:51.77]How do I pick... No, I can't.
[96:01.77]These look like pigs.
[96:04.36]No, I don't want to get rid of this one.
[96:05.54]This one's fun.
[96:07.42]This one's... Oh, I like them all.
[96:09.50]Alright.
[96:13.06]How do I, uh...
[96:17.42]How do I put him up for adoption?
[96:25.73]I did it.
[96:26.07]I think I did it.
[96:28.33]No, I didn't.
[96:30.07]Did I do it?
[96:32.75]How?
[96:33.27]You still need space.
[96:37.07]I'm trying to fire the beavers.
[96:40.05]They still need space.
[96:43.29]Oh, okay.
[96:44.25]Look at that.
[96:46.69]Done.
[96:51.69]Very cool.
[96:52.41]Very cool.
[96:55.58]Okay.
[96:57.20]So now, interestingly enough, okay.
[97:02.06]Let's... I'm just kidding.
[97:05.90]Alright, let's go.
[97:21.48]Then out there in numbers, put in a crocodile.
[97:23.62]No.
[97:24.18]I'm not going to fuck with the beaver exhibit.
[97:25.93]It's the best thing we got.
[97:26.83]Okay.
[97:31.63]I've been doing this for so long.
[97:46.38]Get out of here.
[97:48.11]Alright, now we need... We have our beaver exhibit.
[97:51.52]Is that worth $50 to come in and see shitty beavers?
[98:04.47]Alright, let's go back to this.
[98:13.05]I can't just have it drive through the exhibit, guys.
[98:17.13]I just started.
[98:18.01]I can't ruin everything.
[98:24.50]You know what I mean?
[98:25.18]We need to at least make this... I can't do that right now.
[98:33.04]That's too much.
[98:34.66]Maybe it... That's not safe, apparently.
[98:48.04]There we go.
[98:51.24]I just need to go around it.
[98:55.20]I... People still need to... I need an enjoyable ride in this park.
[99:02.47]You understand?
[99:05.81]Everything here sucks.
[99:07.53]Nothing here is good.
[99:08.95]Everything sucks.
[99:14.52]You drive around in a go-kart around a beaver exhibit, and it's 50 bucks.
[99:18.41]Actually, that's kind of cool.
[99:20.37]That actually is pretty cool.
[99:21.45]Never mind.
[99:22.87]Staying corrected by myself.
[99:24.47]Alright.
[99:25.31]Open it.
[99:27.29]Click to close the station.
[99:28.13]No guests can enter when the station is closed.
[99:29.87]I think we need... Can we use it?
[99:34.80]Incomplete circuit.
[99:35.78]Oh, it's because of this.
[99:41.70]Okay.
[99:42.92]Build...
[99:46.58]Uh, how do I go?
[99:47.92]Change circuit direction?
[99:49.57]No, that's fine.
[99:53.03]So this should complete the circuit.
[99:56.49]Incomplete circuit?
[99:57.51]Where?
[100:03.98]Fuck.
[100:06.46]Oh well.
[100:18.32]You stupid motherfucker.
[100:20.26]Okay.
[100:46.92]Open.
[100:47.82]So how do we test it?
[100:48.56]What kind of Jeep do we want to use?
[100:51.32]Definitely the Jurassic Park one.
[100:57.77]Click select and then place the decorated Jeep.
[101:01.17]Yeah, place it, man.
[101:03.26]Actually, no, this one.
[101:05.20]This one.
[101:16.66]I guess I can have, like, more than five?
[101:21.34]Nobody... Who's even in these?
[101:24.04]I'm wasting so much money.
[101:25.60]Are these guys gonna never end?
[101:28.72]Just drive around the track with nobody?
[101:32.44]Can I get in?
[101:36.54]How do I get in?
[101:38.94]Wait, I own the place!
[101:40.28]Let me in!
[101:48.38]Oh, I can get on.
[101:51.28]See, we're taking a tour of Beaver Park.
[101:58.48]What's this guy's problem?
[102:00.08]Get back to work.
[102:05.93]What's going on?
[102:09.89]What's happening here?
[102:11.01]Hey!
[102:12.11]How do I beep the horn?
[102:20.45]This actual traffic.
[102:23.19]What's the issue here?
[102:24.00]Oh, look at how cute that is!
[102:30.54]Pick with my photo!
[102:46.16]I missed it.
[102:51.02]How do I fix this?
[102:52.50]Okay.
[102:54.85]The terrain is impassable.
[102:59.07]How do I take care of that?
[103:00.68]I think I know how to take care of it.
[103:17.86]Capacity 6.
[103:19.84]Capacity 6.
[103:28.10]Okay.
[103:29.38]So, that's the ride there.
[103:32.76]Looking good.
[103:35.06]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[103:37.02]Now we just need a guest to ride in the gigantic Jurassic Park funeral caravan, apparently.
[103:47.62]This is just like, ugh.
[103:57.11]I thought, didn't I fire you?
[103:58.31]Oh no, you're the other one.
[104:03.09]Dino is back.
[104:04.89]Alright, we're good.
[104:05.95]So now, I gotta make some decent roads.
[104:11.19]Let's go up here.
[104:16.83]Because this will take you then straight through and then up here into the next exhibit, which we will determine what that is very soon.
[104:28.34]I don't know what the hell it's going to be, but it's going to be right here.
[104:34.69]Okay.
[104:35.93]Looking good.
[104:37.81]So at this point... What the fuck?
[104:44.34]Okay.
[104:44.86]That looks fine.
[104:47.76]Zoo... I don't want to open it yet.
[104:49.34]I need... That guy just fell out of the gate.
[104:52.94]Wait, he swam to the gate.
[104:54.36]Where's the gate?
[104:58.14]Oh, for the love of God.
[105:02.80]I need more than one gate.
[105:03.90]Do they have food in here?
[105:08.98]Where?
[105:09.30]I feel like this is a people habitat as much as it is a beaver one.
[105:15.91]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[105:20.60]Watch out, I have 25 employees whose job it is just to drive in a circle all day.
[105:27.42]So they can't be hurt, that's good.
[105:42.45]That's very good to know.
[105:43.23]Alright, so now,
[105:51.32]Like lost on what I want to do next here Connect let's make this a double This is enough room for people to watch I want to have a donation exhibit here I Need some food some stalls
[106:16.54]Let's try to get around this somehow.
[106:21.15]That has to go.
[106:21.79]I'm so, I'm so glad that they can't get run over.
[106:38.09]It's just a fever prison.
[106:41.45]No, it's not.
[106:44.95]This is making me so nervous.
[106:46.25]I feel like someone's gonna get fucking run over.
[106:53.79]It's a beaver prison that is being constantly patrolled.
[107:02.21]By a caravan of staff.
[107:03.85]Okay.
[107:10.35]People can cross that.
[107:11.21]That's fine.
[107:16.78]High security.
[107:18.24]High security for the beavers.
[107:20.82]Make sure nobody gets out of there.
[107:25.91]So, how much electricity have I wasted so far?
[107:28.37]Let's take a look at my finances.
[107:37.11]Are you kidding me? $260,000.
[107:45.10]at least I got I got a deductible of 7 700 this year taxes what is the beavers of that expensive that's how much 10 beavers costs that's not true a beaver is like roughly 60 dollars
[108:14.04]They had to be imported from America, because this is Europe.
[108:20.37]It was the dinosaurs!
[108:23.09]Alright, well that's a wash though.
[108:28.87]This month doesn't count.
[108:34.08]Okay, honestly, that's more confusing than if it was beavers, because a T-Rex is definitely worth more than probably $50 million.
[108:43.02]How much was a T-Rex?
[108:44.05]10 grand?
[108:44.81]20 grand?
[108:47.83]No, don't.
[108:48.41]You can't fire.
[108:51.45]No, don't fire.
[108:52.85]Alright, we need... I need some kiosks here.
[108:57.29]We need ATM.
[108:59.50]Yeah, we want to clean them out.
[109:09.22]Right behind that is the donation machine.
[109:13.50]Where's the donation machine?
[109:18.37]Yeah, you take out money from the ATM and you go directly to the fucking donation machine behind you.
[109:27.11]Where is it?
[109:29.69]That's an educator podium.
[109:33.31]Family restroom... ATM.
[109:38.38]Is the zoo open yet?
[109:39.34]No.
[109:43.78]Research lab.
[109:44.60]Am I missing something here?
[109:54.97]Wireless headsets?
[110:01.51]Maybe it's over here.
[110:06.73]Gift cart.
[110:09.24]Wireless headset.
[110:11.32]Cave painting hall.
[110:14.99]Oh, here it is.
[110:15.41]Okay.
[110:16.59]Donation box.
[110:20.41]So let's spin this around over here.
[110:24.59]And then do one over here as well.
[110:29.11]Guys, if you like the show, you know, consider wiping out your checking account.
[110:37.08]Does this cost money to use?
[110:40.91]No, don't sell it.
[110:41.67]Okay.
[110:46.19]That's good.
[110:46.89]Okay.
[110:48.19]Alright.
[110:48.88]So I got money.
[110:49.82]I need food.
[110:52.84]Picnic table.
[110:53.42]We'll make a little spot over here.
[110:55.96]Let's get some concrete, dirt, sand, brick, stone.
[111:02.09]This would be like the food area.
[111:05.65]This guy's dancing in the road.
[111:10.75]He's just getting beeped at.
[111:13.26]Get out of the way!
[111:14.14]Hey, come on.
[111:22.84]You gotta make a living.
[111:25.78]So, stone path.
[111:29.46]This is gonna be the food court.
[111:31.42]So, we're gonna go this way.
[111:40.41]That's fine over there.
[111:44.59]That's good.
[111:44.95]So there's going to be food, drinks, right at the beginning.
[111:48.01]Put a bathroom over here.
[111:49.81]Oh, maybe we won't.
[111:55.25]Elevated paths.
[111:56.11]Okay, buildings.
[112:00.10]So we need a... I need an educator podium in front of the beavers.
[112:04.44]That's going to be over here.
[112:07.88]Really important.
[112:09.28]This is all I have.
[112:10.08]I need an educator.
[112:18.38]I need some maintenance workers, too.
[112:21.60]A trainer?
[112:22.06]We can teach him tricks?
[112:28.30]Cool, okay.
[112:30.70]There's the educator podium for the beaver exhibit.
[112:40.25]I'm just poisoning with carbon.
[112:43.95]No.
[112:44.57]They're far enough away.
[112:45.47]Everything's going to be fine.
[112:46.15]Alright, I'm almost ready to open my zoo.
[112:50.38]Almost time.
[112:54.30]Small restroom.
[112:55.52]Staff center.
[112:59.70]This is huge.
[113:01.88]What's going up here?
[113:02.50]Okay.
[113:07.58]Okay.
[113:10.17]Name of the beavers.
[113:12.69]Not yet.
[113:14.75]I gotta build some more stuff, though.
[113:17.17]Okay, we need food.
[113:19.20]I can't look at this.
[113:20.62]I'm gonna get hungry.
[113:21.84]I really will get hungry looking at this.
[113:24.44]Sub sandwich.
[113:26.18]Subs are meat-filled sandwiches that are commonly devoured for lunch.
[113:29.10]Why would you word it like that?
[113:30.40]Weird.
[113:34.00]Okay.
[113:34.84]Sub shop.
[113:35.40]S- Sushi.
[113:39.16]I need to put the sushi place in front of an aquarium exhibit, don't I?
[113:45.81]Well, that's really fun.
[113:46.61]Why would I want to do that?
[113:50.55]No, that's normal, right?
[113:54.02]Salads.
[113:58.28]Coffee.
[114:01.30]And... Water.
[114:05.02]Make sure water is... We need water over here.
[114:10.66]Cotton candy?
[114:11.66]Candy cane cart?
[114:12.52]No.
[114:13.06]Soda drinks.
[114:18.37]And hot dogs.
[114:22.13]Alright.
[114:23.43]Uh... Okay.
[114:38.36]I think I'm almost ready to open the park.
[114:44.00]I'm ready.
[114:44.64]No, not yet.
[114:46.88]These are luxurious food stands.
[114:48.20]Yeah, you're paying for quality.
[114:50.70]That's not shitty quality.
[114:53.54]Going to staff center for supplies.
[114:54.92]Okay, good thing I have the staff center.
[114:56.17]Alright, I need one more exit before I open the zoo.
[114:58.93]And it's going to be... Something that I can handle it.
[115:02.27]How about one... One beluga.
[115:06.39]No.

[115:07.85]A huge whale.
[115:08.51]Orca.
[115:11.86]Orca.
[115:14.72]Giant Warthog.
[115:21.32]I don't know.
[115:22.76]Should I make a Beluga Whale?
[115:30.17]What the hell?
[115:33.33]Cave Lion.
[115:35.25]Komodo Dragon.
[115:39.43]Gigantopithecus.

[116:15.64]So let's do... Let's get the area secure.
[116:20.64]Okay.
[116:26.76]What does he eat?
[116:27.35]Okay.
[116:28.27]Okay.
[116:45.58]He needs a better habitat.
[116:47.90]He needs a habitat.
[116:50.30]He eats beavers.
[116:51.60]What do you eat?
[116:53.15]He's extinct.
[116:55.13]Look, I'm bringing him back.
[116:58.99]No, he eats lure buoy.
[117:02.81]Dinosaur meat.
[117:06.68]Frimp.
[117:09.16]He's got a lot of options here.
[117:12.32]Look, I'm just getting one of those dog toys and filling it with different foods and peanut butter and stuff.
[117:20.98]It's really hard for him to do.
[117:22.40]He's sticking his tongue in there like, I can't get it.
[117:27.86]Alright, so he eats fish.
[117:33.18]Let's go ahead and get him in there.
[117:36.34]Pause the game, though.
[117:39.86]Holy shit.
[117:41.02]He's huge.
[117:42.61]Alright, so we need roots, food dish, bamboo.
[117:51.92]Is this what you eat?
[117:53.76]What happened to the dinosaur head?
[117:59.24]Squeaky toy.
[118:10.83]Okay.
[118:16.93]Feeder ball.
[118:17.77]Okay.
[118:18.21]Feeder ball.
[118:21.16]Squeaky toys.
[118:26.80]Habitat.
[118:28.08]Shade structure.
[118:30.34]Rock shelter.
[118:31.80]Or... A lion top of... This is big.
[118:36.61]What about this?
[118:37.49]Here we go.
[118:46.84]I wish I could put it here.
[118:57.95]Only let him have the easel?
[118:59.57]Oh, this is what it's... This is what I'm going to have to do.
[119:01.93]No, wait.
[119:02.21]Hold on.
[119:04.51]This is what I'm going to have to do for now.
[119:07.23]I can expand later.
[119:10.59]Food.
[119:10.99]We're going to put branches over here.
[119:15.42]Put some food dish.
[119:21.39]Let's put some yummy leaves.
[119:25.64]Okay.
[119:28.16]Let's give him some little trees.
[119:33.74]Alright, looks good.
[119:34.56]Let's give him a rock.
[119:36.82]Oh!
[119:37.62]Okay, I thought I just killed him.
[119:40.10]That scared the shit out of me for some reason.
[119:41.66]Alright.
[119:46.08]Okay.
[119:47.02]So now he needs a...
[119:51.77]Uh, we need this, uh, what is it?
[119:54.11]What does he need?
[119:54.55]The tundra?
[119:56.08]Family tree?
[119:56.80]Wait, they're gonna start having babies?
[120:01.96]Alright, I need, what does he need?
[120:04.10]What biome?
[120:08.72]I forget what the hell it was.
[120:11.38]Four, it was tropical rainforest, there it is.
[120:12.82]Alright, let's go with this.
[120:18.38]What the fuck?
[120:28.93]Okay.
[120:32.12]Let's get... I can put a few of these trees in here.
[120:33.96]Actually, this is elevated now.
[120:35.50]Let's go up here.
[120:36.22]He should be happy.
[120:39.26]I'd be happy.
[120:41.42]Put him in the golden seeds.
[120:44.08]I think he... Okay.
[120:44.90]So let's see how that happens.
[120:46.14]Let's get the exhibit out.
[120:50.04]I need to put an entrance here.
[120:54.60]Right here.
[120:55.82]Actually, let's put it... Yeah, right there.
[121:00.62]I got my first... Giganthosaurus.
[121:10.29]I gotta think of a good name.
[121:11.63]Is he ready to paint?
[121:14.09]Who's a painter's name?
[121:17.25]Michelangelo?
[121:17.99]Picasso?
[121:21.01]How about Bigasso?
[121:24.84]Because he's big.
[121:26.26]Bigosco.
[121:38.59]Okay.
[121:41.57]He's unable to reach the leaves.
[121:43.05]Maybe too close to another object.
[121:49.44]A beaver is pregnant?
[121:51.58]Where?
[121:53.64]Who's pregnant?
[122:01.47]Oh, this is...
[122:16.86]He's like, oh wow, I got a good view of that.
[122:23.00]What are these?
[122:24.44]What are these fishes?
[122:25.62]Where did they come from?
[122:26.42]Why are you so angry?
[122:29.12]Going to pee.
[122:33.75]You're not gonna go pee in somebody's food, are you?
[122:43.99]What food bowl is he about to piss in?
[122:58.40]Oh, there he goes, peeing on dirt.
[123:01.80]Okay, good pee.
[123:03.07]What the hell is this?
[123:04.41]They made their own beaver lodge.
[123:06.33]I didn't do this, did I?
[123:07.79]Who's in there?
[123:10.15]Resting in the beaver lodge.
[123:11.43]They just made this.
[123:19.34]I want to go in there.
[123:32.28]Am I allowed in here?
[123:33.06]American Beer 3 is practically... They're just having sex with each other in here.
[123:44.25]This is... Okay, this is kind of, like, not good.
[123:53.55]Replenish.
[124:01.41]That's a VR game quality.
[124:05.35]Alright, we're good.
[124:09.98]Yep, these two just, uh... Just create, uh... They're creating babies over here.
[124:15.78]I'm gonna have to keep expanding this.
[124:17.80]They're just gonna keep having sex with each other.
[124:19.38]And they're gonna keep having babies.
[124:21.80]I'm gonna have to keep expanding this.
[124:28.83]The bark isn't even open yet.
[124:30.29]Well, how's my other guy doing?
[124:36.87]For a second I was like, why is he not here?
[124:39.66]Going to pee.
[124:44.50]Squeaky toy.
[124:46.10]Where's he gonna pee?
[124:47.38]He's gonna piss on the easel and make art.
[124:51.57]Let's visit him.
[124:58.24]Whoa, easy.
[125:01.63]I want to groom him.
[125:02.31]How do I groom him?
[125:06.37]He's getting antsy.
[125:07.17]I don't like this.
[125:11.81]No, he's happy.
[125:14.95]Look how happy.
[125:15.61]50.
[125:16.19]Look, he's like, I can lift so much weight.
[125:20.26]Alright, well, you're good.
[125:23.26]Currently sitting.
[125:27.32]Draw something.
[125:27.96]Alright, I need to... It's time to open the park.
[125:30.38]Wait, I need an education stand and a donation machine.
[125:43.45]Educator platform can go here.
[125:50.18]We need another educator.
[125:56.98]And I need some donation machines as well.
[126:02.47]Donation box.
[126:03.61]Go ahead.
[126:08.09]Right in front.
[126:10.75]I think it's time to actually open this place.
[126:14.08]I'm going to save it.
[126:16.24]Another beaver is pregnant.
[126:21.32]Save game.
[126:32.26]Alright, beavers and big guys.
[126:40.47]Alright.
[126:41.53]It's time to open the park.
[126:43.17]Wait, I need a toilet.
[126:45.59]I need a bathroom.
[126:46.59]It's really important.
[126:51.96]Let's do family restroom.
[126:56.88]This is huge.
[127:09.73]Alright, good enough.
[127:12.85]It's a couple's restroom?
[127:14.37]What?
[127:14.59]Alright, what's wrong with the leaves?
[127:21.01]You apparently can't reach these leaves.
[127:27.00]Because they're too high.
[127:27.78]Okay.
[127:29.98]Well, then let's make the terrain better then.
[127:43.13]I need to lower the ground.
[127:47.18]I may have just fucked it all up.
[127:48.60]Whatever.
[127:49.22]Open the park.
[127:52.96]The park is now officially... open.
[128:14.79]Let's go.
[128:15.37]Racking the money.
[128:23.48]I can't wait to see some animals.
[128:27.26]Beaver and Butthead.
[128:34.38]One person.
[128:36.52]After months and months in development.
[128:39.41]One.
[128:41.47]One guy.
[128:41.81]Okay.
[128:44.81]Well, I hope you enjoy yourself.
[128:46.33]Get to work.
[128:48.19]The first guest you've been training for so long.
[128:52.11]For this exact moment right here.
[128:54.35]And you're missing your opportunity.
[128:59.98]Where's he going?
[129:00.42]We're going to follow this guy around.
[129:05.30]No ATM.
[129:05.96]Skip the ATM.
[129:08.20]Skipping the donation machine.
[129:13.66]Okay.
[129:19.03]I think this person is so dehydrated and foodless at this point.
[129:24.15]Ooh, I like seeing animal American Beaver 13 eat from the substrate pile.
[129:31.40]It's neat seeing American Beaver 2 resting in the beaver lodge.
[129:35.36]I can't wait to see some more animals.
[129:37.24]Wait, track him.
[129:43.67]He likes it.
[129:47.45]He's... Kimmy is high.
[129:49.41]Oh, we got another guest.
[129:53.29]See?
[129:54.03]This guy just tweeted out that he was here and how fun it was.
[129:57.82]And his five followers decided to come.
[130:04.98]I can't wait to what people have to say about... Is nobody gonna get on that ride?
[130:18.81]I want someone to get... How do I get them on the ride?
[130:25.15]Is it possible?
[130:29.19]At least they're happy.
[130:29.99]I need, like, benches.
[130:31.13]I need a place to sit down.
[130:38.12]American Beaver 4 is about to give birth.
[130:44.54]Come on, come on.
[130:44.92]This is the first time.
[130:58.39]This is my first ever time that I'm going to... I got it.
[131:16.58]Oh, now there's not enough space.
[131:17.76]I have... There's not enough space.
[131:25.94]More space.
[131:29.05]Many animals don't have enough space because they're a beaver and they're inside of this giant beaver enclosure.
[131:35.29]Another birth.
[131:36.03]Oh, god damn it.
[131:40.30]I can stay on top of this.
[131:52.40]What the fuck's going on here?
[131:55.08]Here comes another one.
[132:01.82]Okay.
[132:07.83]Here comes the magic of birth!
[132:30.59]More space!
[132:31.55]Ah!
[132:37.75]No, the park is open!
[132:39.07]The park is currently open!
[132:40.46]Hold on.
[132:47.34]Set them all free!
[132:48.80]No, I'm not gonna set them all free.
[132:50.86]Free.
[133:09.75]The hell?
[133:10.13]No one can even walk in the park.
[133:15.29]There needs to be a path that now leads up here and then around.
[133:19.73]I gotta level this whole thing.
[133:21.12]Hold on, let me...
[133:38.74]I'm making sure that I'm gonna future-proof this whole exhibit here.
[133:49.20]Oh, fuck.
[133:55.79]Uh... Sorry about that, guys.
[134:11.41]I'll fix this, don't worry.
[134:16.92]Those guys just drove around in a circle until they were evaporated.
[134:24.54]Okay, now this is going to come out all the way to here.
[134:29.62]Right there.
[134:30.90]And then up here.
[134:37.94]like this look at how much more space this is going to be and then down here the path is going to go around to make sure this doesn't happen for like another at least 30 minutes that's done
[135:04.18]No one even, no, people are gonna walk in this park and say, well, the beaver exhibit is stupid, and they leave.
[135:09.89]Little do they know that I have an extinct animal up here that is wildly intelligent.
[135:16.41]He can paint paintings.
[135:20.73]Sell some beavers.
[135:21.65]I can't.
[135:22.61]You just have to put them up for adoption.
[135:25.89]See?
[135:31.59]Big Osco has no water?
[135:37.96]Well, I'll get to that in a second.
[135:42.76]I'll get to that in just a second.
[135:44.96]Alright, we need not tropical rainforest.
[135:46.48]We need... wetlands.
[135:52.80]Take the trees off.
[135:54.32]I'm okay with a little bit of rocks.
[136:03.01]Now... I can expand the water a little bit.
[136:06.45]Actually, let's have a nice little spot for them to go, like up here.
[136:15.16]Yeah, so that looks good.
[136:17.64]Maybe a little bit deeper.
[136:21.52]Give them some more room.
[136:25.54]Alright.
[136:26.70]Okay.
[136:29.36]Alright.
[136:35.10]Now there's no problem.
[136:36.42]We just need to put a... Put crocodiles in there.
[136:44.26]What?
[136:44.94]Will a crocodile eat a beaver in the same amount of time it takes for a beaver to come out of conception?
[136:52.00]You know what I mean?
[136:52.42]Like, to be conceived.
[136:54.34]To be birthed.
[136:55.98]Born.
[136:57.50]Is that going to be the same?
[136:58.82]Probably not.
[137:04.45]Okay, so let's get... I need the entrance.
[137:10.59]So we need one here.
[137:12.69]We need one up here.
[137:15.39]Alrighty, let's go.
[137:18.35]Oh shit, you have to be out here.
[137:20.54]I need to move this.
[137:21.08]I need to move this.
[137:29.48]I need fucking a road.
[137:34.20]Not contained.
[137:35.22]How is American Bieber 4 not contained?
[137:39.23]Yes, you are.
[137:41.45]They're all happy.
[137:44.19]They can't get to the A. Wait.
[138:07.58]Now they can I need an elevated path I wonder if I can
[138:32.19]Okay, they can make it.
[138:32.83]Just need to get rid of this.
[138:35.90]It's a little ugly, but I'll fix it later.
[138:50.62]More birth.
[138:54.01]I don't think I can possibly get up here.
[138:56.29]I need to make an elevated path.
[139:00.10]Stone elevated path.
[139:01.06]Okay, so we're gonna go right here.
[139:06.26]And then this is gonna... Ramp down.
[139:11.24]This is gonna be down.
[139:12.56]Yeah, like that.
[139:14.64]And then that leads to here.
[139:27.23]Alright.
[139:28.99]We're good?
[139:30.85]They can make it up here?
[139:35.67]Oh, you dummy!
[139:38.28]I need to really get in there.
[139:57.63]The park is still open, isn't it?
[140:01.83]Just make the bridge go over the beavers.
[140:03.77]I mean, I was thinking about that.
[140:09.01]It's a pretty good idea.
[140:09.79]Okay, that looks good.
[140:18.62]By good, I mean not good at all.
[140:22.50]It's alright.
[140:23.22]Look at that.
[140:23.86]That's fine.
[140:25.66]We just gotta fix this one.
[140:27.88]Later.
[140:31.76]How we doing?
[140:32.22]We got any, uh... I don't like this zoo.
[140:36.01]It's time for me to go home.
[140:59.38]I don't think he's... I don't think he's aggressive.
[141:01.32]He just thinks it's funny.
[141:05.52]He's just laughing.
[141:10.33]Whoa!
[141:10.99]No way!
[141:12.05]What?
[141:13.61]What are you doing?
[141:15.53]No!
[141:15.99]You're fired!
[141:29.05]Alright, hey, how do I make you happy?
[141:30.87]I need to give him water.
[141:31.75]Oh, I can't.
[141:54.52]Whatever.
[141:55.42]I'm not even gonna say anything.
[141:58.91]Look at this painting.
[141:59.81]Oh, that looks like shit.
[142:00.75]What happened to the kid?
[142:06.91]Where did the guest go?
[142:23.56]Alright, I gotta get back to this.
[142:27.37]No, he just gave him a little tap on the face.
[142:29.39]And look at me racking in mad dough over here.
[142:35.37]Angry.
[142:36.47]I think coffee drink one is overpriced.
[142:38.41]Oh, catch it!
[142:48.03]Fucking shot him.
[142:53.53]Put her in there.
[142:55.17]It's, oh, I'm really need to use the bathroom.
[142:58.03]I'm upset at the lack of trash cans.
[142:59.53]I hope hot, I hope dog hot, I hope hot dog food stand, guests would like a place to sit.
[143:06.95]Hey!
[143:11.16]Littering?
[143:12.56]You're gonna litter at my park?
[143:15.26]This area smells.
[143:49.17]He's just like, that is funny.
[143:53.64]People are screaming.
[143:58.14]I want to get over there.
[144:01.16]He hasn't done anything wrong.
[144:09.97]He's just listening to what she's saying.
[144:13.63]He's very entertained.
[144:18.92]Uh-oh.
[144:25.99]He doesn't like this person.
[144:29.15]I don't know why.
[144:38.56]He just wants to eat leaves.
[144:43.62]I wonder... Alright, let's let her out of here.
[144:51.22]Well, he really doesn't care at all.
[145:00.55]Help!
[145:02.03]Big Asko is chasing me!
[145:05.75]Well, that's not real.
[145:08.23]He's chasing me!
[145:09.39]Alright, you're fine.
[145:23.10]That was a fake Yelp complaint.
[145:31.60]He needs food.
[145:33.36]He doesn't have any food left?
[145:37.77]What's he doing?
[145:45.69]What happened?
[145:46.41]What's wrong with him?
[145:46.89]What happened?
[145:47.27]Oh, he's just sleeping.
[145:49.64]Okay.
[145:50.76]Let's get some food in here for you.
[145:53.48]How about like a bowl of leaves?
[145:59.78]Here.
[146:01.88]There.
[146:03.83]Now you can eat.
[146:04.81]And you've got water.
[146:05.67]There's water here.
[146:07.99]There's still water in there.
[146:11.07]Yeah, he's fine.
[146:11.77]What are you talking about?
[146:16.23]So now, this is how you get reviews.
[146:18.49]This is how you get attention to your park.
[146:21.87]Everybody's reading in the newspaper about the guy that got pushed over and the lady that was screaming, and now everyone just needs to come see for themselves.
[146:30.85]Marketing.
[146:32.23]One-on-one.
[146:32.45]Alright, how are we doing with the beavers?
[146:42.01]The beaver's an attraction?
[146:43.63]Yeah, people like the beavers.
[146:47.05]Seems to be going pretty well.
[146:52.07]Uh, how do I get rid of this fucking thing?
[146:53.59]I'm not even going to use it.
[146:54.35]Alright, what's the next attraction?
[147:11.36]Why don't people need to be able to get up there first?
[147:15.32]I guarantee I turn a profit this next month.
[147:20.85]Alright, the track is gone.
[147:21.77]It's just an annoyance.
[147:27.66]Let's get some benches.
[147:31.46]So, bench.
[147:32.78]Just sit it.
[147:37.80]We need to make these a little wider.
[147:38.90]And the food court.
[147:46.07]There's gotta be some benches.
[147:51.70]What are you so angry about?
[147:53.08]Relax.
[147:53.46]I don't have a place to sit down and drink my tea.
[147:57.90]I need trash bins.
[148:07.89]Alright.
[148:09.22]Finally people can throw their trash away.
[148:10.84]It's been like two hours.
[148:17.75]American Beaver 13 is really thirsty.
[148:19.67]American Beaver 5 is unable to reach the hollow log.
[148:29.99]What?
[148:30.67]Just drink water.
[148:32.55]There's running water right here.
[148:42.20]Just drink water.
[148:43.10]Alright, I need to refill.
[148:46.58]No, this is full.
[148:49.35]Is there really one water dish?
[148:57.13]These needs are fulfilled.
[148:58.33]This is the only one.
[149:03.11]Everyone's drinking out of the same water dish.
[149:08.03]Oh, for the love of God.
[149:09.07]Okay, hold on.
[149:12.89]I didn't know that.
[149:13.91]I thought they just went underwater and just went...
[149:21.69]He's going to fill it.
[149:22.57]I need a bunch of these.
[149:23.77]I need them over here.
[149:32.59]Food dish with water.
[149:33.55]Put it next to the food so I don't have to go that far.
[149:41.98]That looks good.
[149:44.94]Alright.
[149:46.18]How are we doing with money?
[149:57.99]Whatever.
[150:02.23]$175 for a tuna can with water in it.
[150:04.39]Yeah.
[150:06.07]All they're doing, guys, is the zookeepers are going over here and dumping the dish in there and just putting it over there.
[150:11.99]That's a $175 middleman.
[150:14.43]Alright, let's go...
[150:22.60]See how he's doing.
[150:24.44]Your needs are good.
[150:27.24]Not that thirsty.
[150:28.00]Everything's good to go.
[150:28.76]Alright.
[150:34.76]I think it's time to add on to the zoo.
[150:40.18]The next thing is going to be a water exhibit over here.
[150:44.66]I need another bathroom.
[150:47.70]Family restroom.
[150:51.10]Right here.
[150:54.26]And then take a path up this way.
[150:57.22]And this is our first water exhibit.
[150:58.68]It's going to be right here.
[150:59.68]It's going to be like five killer whales.
[151:08.70]Let's see what we need.
[151:10.08]What kind of habitat do you need?
[151:17.01]Can perform in shows.
[151:20.95]We should get a flavor bird exhibit.
[151:22.51]No, that's not bad.
[151:25.53]That's not a bad idea.
[151:26.23]Just like a Stegosaurus.
[151:36.78]Manatee.
[151:39.06]Mastodon.
[151:43.80]I mean, that's kind of a flavor bird right there.
[151:46.04]No, that's the real flavor bird.
[151:51.72]I want a water exhibit, though.
[151:56.55]Whale shark.
[151:58.39]That's the biggest shark in the world, right?
[152:00.23]Yeah.
[152:01.45]I want a whale shark exhibit.
[152:11.81]Maybe some sort of water dinosaur.
[152:15.71]Tyrannosaurus rex.
[152:17.11]This is so huge.
[152:20.52]I kind of need this, though.
[152:23.10]The T-Rex is going to be over here.
[152:24.68]Up.
[152:25.00]You have to go all the way up to see him.
[152:27.14]What a brilliant strategy that is.
[152:35.51]I like that strategy a lot.
[152:37.43]I became famous.
[152:44.25]Did it.
[152:46.72]Alright, we need to do... I'm going to do like two T-Rexes up here.
[152:50.70]This whole entire area.
[152:52.92]The whole viewing angle is going to be from right here.
[152:54.52]We're going to have two T-Rexes up here.
[153:01.31]So you can either go up to the T-Rex or right to the Gosko.
[153:08.83]So let's start with this down here.
[153:15.35]Because it kind of needs to be like this.
[153:17.07]Oh, that didn't fucking do anything.
[153:19.11]I think I'm going to have to go from here.
[153:27.33]Hmm.
[153:31.23]No, not quite.
[153:32.07]What about the manatee exhibit?
[153:38.52]No, don't worry.
[153:39.34]I'll get it.
[153:46.57]Really?
[153:46.85]How do I level this whole thing?
[153:49.53]Can I, like, level this place?
[153:50.69]Just fucking trash it?
[153:54.81]Just make it flat?
[154:00.14]It's guest mode.
[154:01.00]Terrain, editor.
[154:02.98]Here we go.
[154:05.04]Flatten terrain.
[154:05.66]There it is.
[154:19.45]I mean, I gotta fuck this.
[154:20.27]I don't even need this bridge.
[154:24.28]This bridge makes no sense now.
[154:37.89]Don't kill that person for no reason.
[154:39.39]Okay, here we go.
[154:41.83]Flatten terrain!
[154:45.45]Flatten it!
[155:00.98]You dick.
[155:04.98]How did I fi- I'm trying to flatten the terrain!
[155:09.14]I'm just gonna go like this.
[155:23.06]OH!
[155:26.42]Oh fuck, what have I done?
[155:40.16]Okay.
[155:44.22]That's good.
[155:45.66]Now I've got to go back to here.
[155:51.35]Where does this come out from?
[155:55.71]No, this is not going to go up.
[155:56.83]This has to go straight across.
[156:00.50]And then down.
[156:01.74]So right into...
[156:10.24]Right like here.
[156:19.59]How much higher do you have to go?
[156:48.99]No, this is not what I wanted.
[156:54.99]I'm gonna go from here.
[156:56.91]That makes more sense.
[157:04.11]Beaver's pregnant.
[157:05.69]Alright.
[157:08.97]That's good.
[157:19.87]Are you telling me I can't go forward from here?
[157:21.43]That's... That is so close that it's infuriating me.
[157:31.14]How is that possible?
[157:54.19]I got a better idea.
[158:12.44]Smooth this whole damn thing out.
[158:16.45]So now...
[158:21.31]I can just go straight down.
[158:22.98]Right here.
[158:25.84]Crush the Earth onto your fist.
[158:29.14]Alright, can we do this again?
[158:34.53]Guests need bathrooms.
[158:35.51]Well, I'm trying to make a T-Rex exhibit, so... You're gonna have to wait.
[159:25.67]There we go.
[159:26.43]Got it.
[159:26.81]Alright.
[159:27.45]Now we just need a regular path.
[159:31.37]Let's get some more viewing angle for the beavers until it splits.
[159:42.06]Which it's going to split this way.
[159:43.26]Fuck you, game.
[159:50.84]How do I get rid of you?
[159:51.92]I can't get rid of you.
[159:57.15]Like, try to flatten you and it don't work.
[160:05.22]Flatten.
[160:09.40]Why is that one piece just sitting there?
[160:11.32]Why are you doing this to me?
[160:28.68]Dear Lord.
[160:29.50]Oh, God.
[160:31.67]Just keep it there.
[160:32.53]Who cares?
[160:39.63]Oh, no, no, no.
[160:40.61]Now they're going to get out.
[160:43.12]What have you thought about it?
[160:43.94]Okay.
[160:47.44]So now we have this entrance this way.
[160:49.40]This goes up to the... Uh, Bigasco.
[160:53.40]Now it's time to make the T-Rex inhabit it.
[160:58.03]Yeah, okay.
[161:01.05]This needs a path.
[161:04.15]Can I walk up this?
[161:06.74]Okay, it works.
[161:10.98]Good.
[161:13.52]Path.
[161:17.52]The path that needs to go... What the hell?
[161:22.13]Why is this green?
[161:23.93]Why did I just lose it?
[161:24.79]I just lost a star!
[161:27.27]I just lost a star, for what?
[161:30.87]What did I lose?
[161:32.01]You can't lose accolades.
[161:36.95]That's absolute dog shit.
[161:38.81]Alright, hold on.
[161:40.87]I guess... They need more bathrooms, huh?
[161:43.72]Sure, I'll make you more bathrooms.
[161:54.10]Is this what you want?
[162:00.01]How many more do you need?
[162:04.48]What's that?
[162:05.62]What are you guys doing over here?
[162:07.86]Are people going and pissing in the bushes or like shitting in the woods?
[162:12.69]Something is blocking the restroom.
[162:18.93]What is blocking?
[162:19.49]What's blocking the restroom?
[162:29.32]Alright, the beavers are fine.
[162:31.02]Everyone's doing well.
[162:34.62]Gas needs more bathrooms.
[162:37.66]Well, you're going to have to settle for what's there for now.
[162:41.05]Alright, we need... Okay.
[163:01.65]Okay.
[163:02.29]This is huge.
[163:03.19]Ah, that sucks.
[163:04.41]Wait a second.
[163:11.47]Have I tried pressing G?
[163:20.98]This terrain is so fucked up.
[163:28.00]Got water?
[163:28.74]Yeah.
[163:29.76]Oh, you're fine.
[163:31.74]Everybody's fine.
[163:32.30]Alright, what does a T-Rex need?
[163:44.23]T-Rex needs a Tropical Rainforest biome.
[163:49.49]So... Uh, okay.
[164:00.46]Tropical Rainforest.
[164:09.51]Little trees in here.
[164:11.73]That looks pretty nice.
[164:15.57]And a little shallow water.
[164:17.31]Right in the corner.
[164:19.15]A little pool.
[164:23.58]American Beaver 6 is pregnant again.
[164:25.46]They're just having non-stop children in here.
[164:32.68]This is the... How can I tell how much money this has made?
[164:36.31]Is there a way for me to tell?
[164:38.56]How much money has the beaver attracted?
[164:39.96]Is there even a donation machine here?
[164:44.95]Has this just been for free the whole fucking time?
[164:54.45]It has been.
[164:56.17]This has been free the entire time.
[165:01.82]Unless I get that... Oh, no, no, no, no, never mind.
[165:04.72]We're doing just fine.
[165:06.30]We're doing just fine.
[165:10.30]American Beaver has received 2,165.
[165:12.82]Let's flatten this out, make it look a little better.
[165:25.83]Make a large viewing angle.
[165:27.11]Delete that.
[165:30.92]Let's see, like that.
[165:32.80]Okay, so there's a lot of people that can be up here.
[165:34.24]We need somebody to give tips on the T-Rex.
[165:39.57]So we need an education kiosk.
[165:44.30]Just did it right here.
[165:51.74]Right here is fine, I think.
[165:53.20]Let's get an educator.
[165:59.52]And a donation box.
[166:03.02]Because this is going to be worth a lot of money.
[166:08.24]So, pay up.
[166:11.18]Seriously.
[166:11.60]Alright.
[166:19.81]So this is the walk up to the T-Rex exhibit.
[166:23.05]Road splits.
[166:24.83]Here's the person to tell you all about T-Rex.
[166:26.29]Here's the donation machine.
[166:29.21]So now I'm going to make sure there's food in there.
[166:31.10]Alright, I can do that.
[166:32.10]$80,000 for a T-Rex.
[166:40.85]Alright.
[166:41.83]Carnivorous predatory dinosaur.
[166:43.63]What do they eat?
[166:46.49]What does a T-Rex eat?
[166:50.02]Male and female.
[166:54.90]Okay.
[166:56.80]T-Rex eats meat.
[167:00.71]Right.
[167:01.13]Makes sense.
[167:11.94]Something is blocking the meat.
[167:15.47]Nothing is blocking the meat.
[167:20.47]They need more space.
[167:23.71]They can eat, right?
[167:32.28]There we go, yeah.
[167:33.02]See, now let's get some water in there.
[167:38.24]Get some toys.
[167:40.44]Live food.
[167:49.27]Okay.
[167:50.99]Lizards.
[167:53.51]Block of ice.
[167:55.81]A spring.
[167:57.65]Needs to be a little bigger, but that's okay.
[168:00.13]Dinosaur prey dummy?
[168:03.50]Oh, that's going to be quite the show.
[168:04.68]Put it right in front.
[168:11.66]The pepperoni.
[168:12.24]I'm blocking the pepperoni.
[168:17.52]Look at how famous I am.
[168:20.43]American Beaver wants to reproduce but can't find a mate.
[168:23.95]That's sad.
[168:24.57]What are you two doing?
[168:30.70]I can't reach the food trough.
[168:32.56]How?
[168:32.96]It's right here.
[168:33.56]Oh, this is probably in the way.
[168:41.81]Are they going to start fighting?
[168:56.75]Okay.
[168:59.79]I put them both in this thing to have dinosaur sex and have dinosaur babies.
[169:07.85]Alright, well, 100, uh, I got 100 guests that visited your zoo.
[169:19.04]That's good.
[169:19.58]Cool.
[169:21.52]How much am I going to get for this?
[169:22.38]$860.
[169:22.40]Thanks.
[169:31.90]Is this- are you injured?
[169:34.84]Social needs.
[169:36.62]My- oh, my poor social needs.
[169:39.26]I wonder- Oh no, what have I done?
[169:55.47]I killed the only friend I had.
[170:00.50]He just broke out of the exhibit.
[170:03.82]Well, he ain't going anywhere.
[170:04.88]Okay, well, my social needs.
[170:09.74]Who does a T-Rex have a friend with?
[170:19.78]Who can be a friend with... What?
[170:23.05]See?
[170:25.01]They all want to come up here now.
[170:30.54]Beavers.
[170:31.72]I can't put a beaver in here.
[170:40.22]Get more space.
[170:47.05]How am I going to get more space?
[170:50.65]I need to go like this.
[170:53.29]The keeper can't reach the T-Rex.
[170:55.03]Oh, because there's no gate on it.
[170:57.60]Right.
[170:58.64]Sorry about that.
[171:00.72]Now you can reach the T-Rex.
[171:01.94]Alright, I need to expand a little bit.
[171:07.18]Let's get, like, a broken leg.
[171:11.73]Why did I just sell, like, the... Oh, never mind.
[171:13.05]Okay.
[171:14.65]So let's, uh... Fix this.
[171:23.63]And then I need the terrain tool.
[171:26.85]And let's go like this.
[171:45.50]There.
[171:46.02]Now there's enough room for you.
[171:53.03]Let's get you fenced back in.
[171:59.63]Okay.
[172:12.09]Not contained.
[172:12.62]Yes, you are.
[172:13.30]That's good.
[172:13.94]Let's get the actual terrain sprayer.
[172:17.10]Tropical rainforest.
[172:21.08]Oh, fuck.
[172:21.78]Whatever.
[172:22.08]Okay.
[172:27.49]Now you should be happy.
[172:34.07]This person got lost.
[172:35.13]Alright.
[172:39.34]Can't re... Oh, the dinosaur shit.
[172:41.56]I'll get it.
[172:53.14]I can go right here.
[172:59.26]See?
[173:00.02]He gets to scream at everybody from across the park.
[173:03.55]You know how crazy that would be?
[173:07.45]Okay, I'll get it.
[173:11.50]What does he need?
[173:13.04]Well, I gotta pick up dinosaur poop.
[173:19.64]Alright.
[173:20.80]Let's wash his body.
[173:22.04]I feel like this would be very unsafe.
[173:27.64]Alright, he's good.
[173:28.38]Just got some more water.
[173:29.58]Okay, we're good.
[173:37.25]I can't leave.
[173:37.85]I need to move this.
[173:38.91]That's why the keeper can't reach him.
[173:44.76]This has to go on the other side.
[173:46.30]This guy's not talking to anyone.
[173:52.16]Alright, we need to get some attraction up here.
[173:55.43]We need to get some people up here.
[173:56.83]You.
[173:58.03]Help, the T-Rex is chasing me.
[174:02.19]This zoo is great.
[174:03.33]Wow, that feels better.
[174:07.71]Alright.
[174:08.27]I got the T-Rex exhibit up here.
[174:10.94]He oversees the whole park.
[174:14.54]Fix the hole.
[174:20.06]Done.
[174:20.22]I'm almost at two stars.
[174:26.69]Getting closer.
[174:27.27]Alright, you're good.
[174:31.15]Alright, we already have more money than the American Beaver exhibit.
[174:41.56]Which, there needs to be... What was wrong?
[174:44.42]What birth?
[174:44.90]How many beavers do I have?
[174:48.30]Is there a way I can tell how many beavers I have?
[174:51.54]16.
[174:51.56]Where's the family tree?
[174:54.39]What?
[175:02.03]What?
[175:05.70]He's still in.
[175:09.38]Where did you come from?
[175:13.33]Alright, it's time to close you up for real.
[175:15.34]Where's, like, the actual... Fence.
[175:19.46]Rail fence.
[175:22.92]We need, like, a dinosaur fence.
[175:30.34]Here.
[175:31.84]No, I don't want to do an electric fence.
[175:33.26]Dinosaur fence.
[175:34.06]Here it is.
[175:37.56]Oh.
[175:40.70]He got out.
[175:41.42]He actually got out.
[175:49.85]Alright.
[175:50.63]He's contained.
[176:00.74]Where was he going to go?
[176:01.82]Nowhere.
[176:02.76]All the way up here?
[176:03.50]I need to replace this whole fence.
[176:17.99]From here.
[176:18.47]Here we go.
[176:29.48]He wants to be free.
[176:31.44]Well, he should have thought about that before he murdered his cellmate.
[176:35.16]I mean, his roommate.
[176:35.96]His roommate.
[176:37.94]His other... His roommate.
[176:51.02]Alright, he's closed off.
[176:52.50]We have a real fence now.
[176:54.73]Actually, I can probably delete this.
[176:58.29]And then expand it a little more.
[177:00.94]I'll put his actual habitat back here.
[177:07.66]Oops.
[177:08.36]Okay.
[177:10.40]So his actual place to sleep is going to go right here.
[177:15.20]Where are you?
[177:15.64]There you go.
[177:21.60]Right in the corner there.
[177:23.78]Hey, look at that.
[177:26.04]Have a good, restful sleep, T-Rex.
[177:31.58]You have toys, you got stuff to do, you got food.
[177:34.20]Let's give him a ball.
[177:35.78]Look, he's going for a bath.
[177:37.71]See?
[177:38.05]Look.
[177:43.61]Why can't you... This is a dinosaur fence.
[177:51.41]Specifically to hold dinosaurs.
[177:54.95]How did you get out of here?
[178:01.43]He found a weak point in the structure.
[178:12.09]He's not going to be able to go anywhere anyways.
[178:15.75]Where are you going?
[178:18.07]Where are you going?
[178:24.50]Hold on.
[178:28.93]He's escaping the whole zoo.
[178:33.05]Is he?
[178:41.26]This biome is not suitable for the T-Rex.
[178:43.64]Well, that's his own fault.
[178:58.41]Get back in there where you belong.
[179:02.27]You don't belong out here.
[179:04.03]What are you mad at?
[179:06.51]What's he angry with?
[179:07.29]What's happening?
[179:15.00]Who's he angry with?
[179:26.89]Here, I gave you a bath.
[179:27.89]American Viva 4 is pregnant.
[179:31.34]Okay.
[179:34.20]Is this where you want to be?
[179:35.84]I'll put a fence around you here.
[179:36.92]No, he's going back.
[179:46.04]I think he's realizing that this is not where I wanted to go at all.
[179:58.27]He needs to go back to his habitat.
[180:06.58]You're going the long way.
[180:07.64]Where is he going?
[180:12.68]He's going all the way around.
[180:19.86]What's the correct biome?
[180:21.14]Tropical.
[180:21.64]Uh-oh, he's getting close to civilization here.
[180:35.29]He looks so tired though.
[180:36.59]What's he gonna do?
[180:40.63]He smells the customers.
[180:46.13]Uh oh.
[180:49.05]Oh no.
[180:50.95]He's doing stealth.
[180:52.91]He's sneaking up on everybody.
[180:54.19]Nobody knows he's here.
[180:55.11]This is the stealthiest T-Rex ever.
[181:19.37]He just wants to go to the zoo.
[181:23.61]Oh, look at that over there.
[181:26.19]That's a cool... That's a cool gorilla.
[181:29.51]What about the beavers?
[181:33.64]He goes to the front, takes money out of the ATM.
[181:38.16]Why is nobody upset about this?
[181:43.10]He just turned into a customer.
[181:57.29]The lady up there is still giving the educational course on the T-Rex.
[182:04.67]If this T-Rex goes into a car and the car drives off, I'm gonna shit my pants.
[182:16.42]No, don't shit on somebody.
[182:17.60]Okay, good.
[182:23.51]He's just leaving the park.
[182:30.40]Uh oh, he's getting angry.
[182:34.44]I can't find my car!
[182:37.08]Did I park it in B1?
[182:38.61]I should have taken a picture of it!
[182:49.81]One dinosaur has roamed the Earth.
[182:57.73]No, no, he's going to the beaver enclosure.
[183:00.11]The beavers are gonna get out now.
[183:13.42]He got an extra life.
[183:24.38]He is the car.
[183:25.30]Here comes the beaver!
[183:27.96]Oh no, a beaver escaped!
[183:35.10]The beaver is not gonna, like, hurt anybody, right?
[183:38.02]If the T-Rex is less aggressive than a fucking beaver, I'm gonna be fucking so pissed off.
[183:50.55]Who's beatboxing?
[183:53.16]Oh shit!
[183:56.48]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[183:57.92]He actually woke up.
[184:02.36]He woke up.
[184:08.75]Is he going to drink the water?
[184:10.51]He's going to drink water out of it.
[184:17.43]He was just thirsty.
[184:18.47]That's all he wanted.
[184:22.46]I'll put the more water in the food dish.
[184:23.92]Look at how pissed off the beavers are.
[184:25.04]The beavers are going to fight him.
[184:27.32]That's a territorial beaver.
[184:30.52]He's struttin' his ass out.
[184:33.06]American beaver has been put in a crate.
[184:44.80]Why would you come in the exhibit here?
[185:00.54]Where's the nearest beaver?
[185:01.64]Alright, just... Yeah!
[185:06.87]Don't fuck with me!
[185:18.15]I gotta get a photo of that.
[185:30.60]Wait, did you just... Did you just come over it?
[185:36.00]That's kind of scary, I'm not gonna lie.
[185:53.25]Honey, I think it's getting closer!
[186:09.64]Out of film.
[186:13.86]We're just filming a movie over here.
[186:15.20]Don't worry.
[186:18.92]He really is just so fucked up.
[186:20.26]Like, what's his deal?
[186:21.17]Another birth.
[186:29.15]Let the beaver out.
[186:32.35]You know what?
[186:32.67]Fuck it.
[186:33.33]It's time for a battle.
[186:38.59]Who's gonna win?
[186:45.48]It's time for a real battle.
[186:57.45]What if they start having sex?
[187:00.60]Uh-oh.
[187:05.50]Whoa, wait, hey!
[187:07.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait, no, don't fight the T-Rex!
[187:16.10]Oh my god, he's freaking out.
[187:19.18]He's freaking out.
[187:31.45]They're working together.
[187:34.09]They should not be working together.
[187:41.66]The T-Rex was just put in a crate.
[188:02.92]alright it's time to hold I need to I need it where's my list of staff I want to get rid of my the staff I need my staff list
[188:32.37]No, I don't want more of them.
[188:33.45]Where is... How do I get there?
[188:35.43]From here, right?
[188:36.15]No.
[188:38.44]Zoo stats.
[188:39.42]Zoo status.
[188:41.62]Photo album.
[188:43.64]Zoo fame.
[188:48.42]There we go.
[188:48.98]Okay.
[188:51.08]So we need some new staff.
[188:54.69]I need to... I want to fire literally everybody.
[188:56.35]You gone?
[188:59.13]You gone?
[189:01.03]You gone?
[189:02.93]You know what I'm saying?
[189:03.47]Like, let him fight.
[189:06.71]Is this King Kong versus Godzilla?
[189:11.25]I thought that was the T-Rex.
[189:12.17]It wasn't, apparently.
[189:12.87]Where's the T-Rex?
[189:20.40]Everybody wants to come in here and drink out of the same water bowl.
[189:22.88]Alright, let's go.
[189:43.60]What are they doing?
[189:44.40]They're just like walking around in circles.
[189:50.79]Tyrannosaurus 1 is really hungry.
[190:04.75]He's going all the way up there.
[190:05.83]Hold on.
[190:15.98]Uh-oh.
[190:18.66]Oh no.
[190:21.53]No, he's just breaking through fences.
[190:26.69]He's coming in to steal his food.
[191:15.08]Where are they all going?
[191:23.65]They're just eating the food.
[191:25.27]They're just sharing the food.
[191:28.19]This kid is so excited.
[191:49.13]Yeah, I can't believe it.
[191:50.29]It's just like Jurassic Park.
[192:01.81]What are they eating over there?
[192:51.09]There are more animals outside than people.
[192:54.56]This lady's still giving a presentation.
[193:36.23]Is this the line for the bathroom?
[193:42.65]Oh, God!
[193:43.27]I'm up in my fourth!

[194:54.52]So what's the deal here?
[194:55.98]He can't... Electric fence.
[195:03.06]Should I... Is this the only way I can contain a T-Rex?
[195:12.90]What if he starts to smash through it?
[195:14.19]Oh, come on.
[195:24.54]Move out of the way.
[195:28.32]I can't believe you can put dinosaurs in this game.
[195:31.86]He's gonna get a shock.
[195:36.03]I forget everything we were just doing.
[195:39.10]Something about a place for them to go up to see the T-Rex or something.

[202:02.33]I need to be on freeform.
[202:09.64]Good luck!
[202:11.70]How am I even going to fix this?

[203:36.87]Perfect.
[203:42.67]Why is this not suitable for Whale Shark?
[203:50.78]What's wrong with it?
[204:00.48]What's wrong with it?
[204:09.74]What's the problem?
[204:13.74]Salt water?
[204:14.32]How do I... Does there a... Check a box for salt water?
[204:23.25]Change the biome.
[204:29.31]They can't survive in pools.
[204:38.48]So, you're telling me that... Benthic.
[204:44.88]So... I did have... Problem solved.
[205:02.04]I turned the water of Benthic.
[205:04.94]That's a 3000 IQ play right there.
[205:18.64]Alright, so what do you eat?
[205:19.80]Let me get some help here.
[205:27.55]Oh, we got a little reef.
[205:33.59]Food box with plankton.
[205:36.76]We got a little toy or something, a buoy.
[205:44.26]Weird clam thing.
[205:47.16]You don't need a habitat, you just sleep on the ground.
[205:49.08]A couple of cool rocks.
[205:52.65]Nice fireworks.
[205:55.11]Get some starfish in here.
[205:56.37]Alright, nice.

[206:23.46]Imagine this is a town.
[206:35.61]Alright, that's good.
[206:41.49]Round it out.
[206:42.69]In fact, go all the way up.
[206:44.97]Look at the glass.
[206:51.57]Why is there just a rock in the middle of the road?
[206:53.05]Get out of here.
[206:58.88]So here's the bathroom.
[206:59.80]Now we need... Oh, fuck.
[207:02.22]I forgot.
[207:02.50]Did I fire?
[207:02.94]No, I didn't fire everybody.
[207:08.66]What does American people want to do?
[207:11.84]Okay, for one second, I thought that was blood all over that and pouring out of the front.
[207:17.67]What the hell happened?
[207:18.55]So, wait, you can't find a good mate?
[207:21.09]Why not?
[207:23.04]What's wrong?
[207:27.90]So you need a mate.
[207:31.89]You're doing fine.
[207:32.57]Here, I'll help you.
[207:54.67]There.
[207:57.69]Name the beavers after chat.
[208:00.26]There's, like, 40 of them.
[208:12.44]No, I can't do, like... I can't do, like, Beaver Rick.
[208:17.13]Because that's... I'm not doing Beaver Rick.
[208:21.67]Uh...
[208:26.36]Oh, Bevo.
[208:32.05]Bevo, Stevo.

[209:48.45]They're done.
[209:55.96]Alright, what happened since I was gone?
[209:57.26]I need to make money over here.
[209:59.02]Come on.
[210:01.48]You need a friend.
[210:02.10]Okay.

[210:20.01]So this is... I need... Okay.
[210:32.80]Okay.
[210:42.25]Yin and Yang, left and right, up and down.
[210:44.56]I should have just named them Yin and Yang.
[210:55.14]Alright, so now... The baby needs to be called Middle.
[211:06.99]Good.
[211:09.38]More American Beavers.
[211:14.15]And now I want to add... Let me see what it looks like from afar.
[211:18.53]Pretty cool.
[211:20.15]Was T-Rex happy?
[211:22.85]Actually, yeah.
[211:24.56]The T-Rex is actually having a good time.
[211:30.58]I mean, at this point, I think it, like, seriously.
[211:33.48]This zoo needs some dessert carts.
[211:34.76]I'm exhausted.
[211:35.30]I need a place to rest.
[211:38.13]Maybe if you didn't walk in circles the whole entire time.
[211:46.29]What do I do about this?
[211:47.01]Because they're just clogging the whole thing.
[212:00.72]Just get out of the way.
[212:07.02]Just get up there.
[212:09.22]Why is he sprinting over here so fast?
[212:11.12]What's his problem?
[212:11.90]What are you doing?
[212:15.06]What's wrong with him?
[212:19.60]That's what, that's what this is for, huh?
[212:23.62]I gotta get over there right now because I gotta rake this shit as fast as I can.
[212:28.78]Alright, well, whatever.
[212:29.50]I need to use the bathroom.
[212:35.18]I can't wait to see some animals.
[212:44.04]Now he's running in circles.
[212:46.64]Thank God.
[213:00.75]I shouldn't have to do this.
[213:05.91]It's time to go home.
[213:09.55]Well, they... Was that guy's name Sandler?
[213:11.82]I thought it was Adam Sandler.
[213:19.12]When this first came up, I thought this said I can smell the restroom from here.
[213:25.28]Oh, that's disgusting.
[213:28.72]That's absolutely revolting.
[213:34.45]They're not going to ever leave here.
[213:35.49]I don't really have a solution.
[213:40.54]Hold on, wait, wait.
[213:42.96]Are you going to get, like, a big roar?
[213:44.70]No.
[213:46.58]No one's even giving me any money.
[213:49.64]Need more water for right and left over here.
[213:52.14]I will add it.
[213:57.92]I'm going for it.
[213:58.46]I'm going for it.
[214:02.82]It's kind of in a weird spot, isn't it?
[214:14.69]It's not the right biome.
[214:17.69]Will it mix the water together?
[214:18.83]There we go, look at that.
[214:21.19]It didn't even do anything.
[214:30.46]Artifact is looking great.
[214:33.46]Artifact?
[214:36.68]I'm not gonna play Artifact.
[214:42.30]No, today was just the chill day, where I wanted just to play something.
[214:46.05]Hang out.
[214:52.73]Why would I ever play Artifact?
[214:55.49]I really want to get rid of this.
[215:02.47]There we go.
[215:02.83]Alright, now you've got enough room, right?
[215:06.03]Need more places to rest.
[215:10.91]Well, shit.
[215:12.35]There's plenty of... No one's even using them!
[215:16.06]Am I really getting complaints about there's nowhere for me to rest and all the benches are empty?
[215:22.20]Empty.
[215:22.60]All of them.
[215:25.84]Oh, really?
[215:26.48]Was it you that complained?
[215:46.67]Gotta do it myself.
[215:59.81]Put it in the bag!
[216:00.63]I just had the bag out!
[216:06.02]I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired!
[216:08.06]Fine.
[216:12.10]Do you want... Am I gonna put out, like, beds and shit here?
[216:18.09]Alright, where is giant bed?
[216:19.55]Ooh.
[216:26.77]No, it's fine.
[216:27.23]You can stay there.
[216:36.86]Park information.
[216:37.72]That's kind of important.
[216:42.90]What about, like, just sitting down here?
[216:47.06]Can I lose this game?
[216:48.40]Not when I have infinite money.
[216:52.02]More places to rest.
[216:53.22]What the fuck?
[216:54.24]I need a place to rest.
[217:00.69]This is the only thing they can see?
[217:02.31]Fat is going to give birth.
[217:06.83]Alright.
[217:08.33]That's good.
[217:19.69]Ain't nobody listening.
[217:24.41]Those people are still complaining about the bench.
[217:28.52]That's a great move.
[217:31.50]How do I up your salary?
[217:37.14]I said, what else can we do for him?
[217:38.46]Okay, now.
[217:40.74]Okay, now.
[217:44.82]What's going on?
[217:46.90]Oh, they're just having babies.
[217:58.50]It was inevitable.
[218:01.86]Oh my god.
[218:21.97]It's too many beavers.
[218:22.95]They're real.
[218:23.65]And it's ruining my whole aesthetic here.
[218:30.28]Oh, Stevo needs more space.
[218:31.86]I better take it seriously now.
[218:34.09]Okay.
[218:36.76]Uh...
[219:13.51]Uh-oh, it's not the Chad Beaver.
[219:16.09]Don't go after the Chad Beaver.
[219:21.09]Oh, no.
[219:23.64]He's gonna get him!
[219:28.58]How's the space looking now?
[219:31.20]We still out of space?
[219:33.66]Rum Raisin has died.
[219:35.50]Of old age.
[219:58.94]We good?
[220:01.82]He's not even eating them.
[220:02.70]He's just killing them for no reason.
[220:04.06]Well, don't worry.
[220:05.12]I have a solution for that.
[220:05.86]Remember we talked about recycling?
[220:08.65]The natural order of the world?
[220:09.73]Alright.
[220:13.23]After he kills like three more people, you'll see.
[220:23.62]I think that beaver was about to give birth.
[220:35.58]How do they still need more space?
[220:41.02]Hold on.
[220:41.28]How do I get to my photo album?
[220:47.39]No, I want to get to the photo album.
[220:51.73]How do I delete pictures?
[220:52.91]Look, these are so awful.
[221:03.36]Delete them all.
[221:07.56]I have like four pictures of the trash.
[221:21.43]I want to keep those ones.
[221:25.71]I like that one.
[221:26.87]I like this string.
[221:29.05]Picture the ground.
[221:29.87]Alright, let's see if I can get it.
[221:32.67]I want to get a mid-jump tiger shot.
[221:40.41]Into the water?
[221:41.17]Jesus.
[221:41.57]No, no, don't.
[221:46.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[222:01.03]Who's he going for?
[222:01.47]Who's he going for?
[222:03.71]Who's he going for?
[222:04.31]Right here.
[222:11.53]Oh, he's gonna kill them all.
[222:12.71]I gotta get him out of here.
[222:13.73]He's gonna kill them all, actually.
[222:14.83]He really might.
[222:15.39]Okay, good work.
[222:23.03]Remember we talked about recycling?
[222:31.58]Look, not wasted.
[222:36.48]Yeah, somebody adopted a cave line.
[222:38.02]Don't ask me who the hell would do that.
[222:44.71]See, he's got food.
[222:46.85]He's got food for probably the next five or six days.
[222:51.71]See?
[222:52.75]He's giving it a sniff.
[222:56.73]He's not like it?
[222:57.31]No, he likes it, see?
[223:00.37]He's happy.
[223:05.67]This is the biggest attraction here.
[223:07.75]$4,400 of donations.
[223:10.81]That's pretty great, considering...
[223:15.29]I don't think the beaver exhibit has even come close.
[223:18.00]Not even half.
[223:21.36]The guests are crying.
[223:23.08]Well, maybe if the guests actually listened to their own advice and sat on the benches that are here, ready for them to be sat on.
[223:34.20]They're available.
[223:40.77]I've had just about enough of... What are they saying?
[223:43.85]I'm exhausted, I'm exhausted, I'm exhausted.
[224:01.32]You exhausted now?
[224:02.12]Holy shit, they're running off to the end, they... It worked.
[224:11.67]Fix the ramp?
[224:12.49]What's wrong with the ramp?
[224:19.10]They were just sprinting off the edges.
[224:20.57]Okay, I fixed it.
[224:45.22]Sacrifices must be made.
[224:47.20]Sorry, guys.
[225:01.03]I mean, that's up there, isn't it?
[225:06.27]Maybe the 70 foot plateau wasn't necessary.
[225:10.59]No, it really wasn't, but this was already here, and I thought it might be cool.
[225:17.71]Pave over the people.
[225:18.96]Can they get up now?
[225:19.54]I don't know.
[225:22.54]I can't tell.
[225:24.08]That looks pretty flush.
[225:25.88]We'll see.
[225:27.48]No, they're bumping into the... This is not going to work.
[225:30.16]They're bumping into the lip here when they come up.
[225:39.84]Either way, it's alright.
[225:54.47]No, it's not gonna work.
[226:28.50]Alright, fixed it.
[226:44.16]Does it work?
[226:55.54]I think so.
[226:57.99]Now it's steeper than before, but now at least they can cross it.
[227:03.77]The beavers are dying.
[227:10.44]Look, I just don't think they're smart enough to understand.
[227:15.16]Well, this is actually a much better view of the exhibit.
[227:17.44]Maybe this is a good idea.
[227:19.15]You can see over the fence.
[227:23.05]No, people are going up and down.
[227:28.68]Rescue these people.
[227:31.96]Let's make it go into the enclosure.
[227:34.72]Let's just drop off into the enclosure.
[227:36.30]Put the path around the whale sharks.
[227:47.12]Look at how far that is, though.
[227:48.30]I have to put that up here and then go around.
[227:52.18]No one is even coming over here.
[227:55.07]This is no educational thing.
[227:56.45]Hold on.
[228:06.36]I need a donation machine as well.
[228:14.38]Okay.
[228:16.20]Nobody cares that this exists.
[228:24.89]Hold on.
[228:25.47]I'll try it.
[228:26.15]Alright, fine.
[228:32.89]This game's fun, though.
[228:35.60]This is a fun game.
[228:40.70]Connect the path to the ladder.
[228:42.30]Is that really what was preventing people from going over here?
[229:05.24]For a second, I thought this person's name was Cornelius.
[229:17.84]Uh.
[229:17.96]A little angry.
[229:27.26]He's waving to the sharks.
[229:31.50]Is this guy just part of the exhibit now?
[229:44.81]He's not even scared.
[229:45.49]Are we gonna get a donation here?
[229:49.61]Maybe?
[229:49.93]He just pet the shark.
[229:53.65]This is just a crazy guy that comes to the aquarium.
[229:56.29]Dives in.
[229:58.59]He actually touched the shark.
[229:59.97]He did it.
[230:01.66]I can't see any animals from here.
[230:09.94]He's just swimming.
[230:12.97]This guy's a pretty damn good swimmer.
[230:24.64]Alright, well... Let me come in there.
[230:35.83]Can I dive?
[230:44.23]This is kind of relaxing.
[230:46.41]I'm kind of just relaxed.
[230:52.53]Anybody else just feeling, like, relaxed right now?
[231:02.26]It's like, whatever.
[231:03.00]He did a T-pose.
[231:12.52]He did not do a T-pose.
[231:15.87]Well, it's about to get far less relaxing.
[231:17.67]I'm sorry.
[231:18.09]Are we gonna get a Jaws scenario?
[231:42.03]It's possible.
[231:53.61]Oh, my God.
[232:00.33]He's okay.
[232:01.47]He's not injured.
[232:03.72]He's actually not injured.
[232:04.80]He just under care.
[232:05.80]He's put his hands up.
[232:07.68]Ah, whatever.
[232:08.08]It's still kind of fun in here.
[232:17.71]It picked him up in his mouth.
[232:20.55]That's it.
[232:22.24]And bit down really, really, really fucking hard.
[232:31.50]He's yawning.
[232:32.70]Alright.
[232:33.48]Good.
[232:50.08]This is what Bill Crazy would do voluntarily.
[232:52.00]Yeah.
[232:58.15]Where is the whale shark?
[233:00.75]Or any shark for that matter.
[233:23.57]Okay, let's see how you handle that now.
[233:41.38]That is fucking terrifying.
[233:45.23]My god, look below.
[233:46.71]Oh my goodness.
[233:49.63]I wouldn't do this for a hundred million dollars.
[234:01.41]The notifications are playing the Jaws theme.
[234:11.12]Is no one going to do anything about this?
[234:19.12]The notifications are playing the Jaws theme.
[234:27.19]That's fucking so funny.
[234:34.80]um I don't know what else I don't know how to do where'd he go where'd he go where'd he go where'd he go did he get out
[235:19.04]Oh, fuck.
[235:19.50]This might actually be bad for the computer.
[235:22.57]Oh no, it should be bad for my computer!
[235:23.97]How do I take care of this?
[235:26.55]Oh, I know.
[235:50.20]I'm trying to hold on.
[236:24.09]Is this what I'm doing in the game right now?
[236:28.05]It is, isn't it?
[236:41.08]No, this is gonna take so long.
[236:42.72]I was about to write out, eat shit in their coffins.
[236:46.62]No, just like, just sell them.
[236:52.28]I can't sell.
[236:52.90]That's not... No, put it back in.
[236:54.74]He's fine.
[237:03.34]Uh...
[237:26.45]Put him in the lake with the beavers.
[237:27.71]I'm not gonna show you that.
[237:45.51]What have I done?
[237:46.21]Well, did I save it somewhere before that fucking weirdo got in the water?
[237:53.13]Like, I jumped through the water.
[237:54.27]Like, what are you doing?
[238:07.79]Fucking beaver scenario again.
[238:09.06]Alright, that's good.
[238:22.07]Now the bridge is messed up again.
[238:24.31]Well... Then... It's time... It... Hold on.
[238:33.90]What are the animals I want to play around with?
[238:37.42]Is there anything else I want to do?
[238:38.32]I mean, I could just put penguins in until the game crashes.
[238:46.26]Until my computer physically turns off.
[238:56.79]Alright, let's... The penguins or... It needs to be small enough where I can put a lot of them.
[239:08.35]And then put a T-Rex right in the middle.
[239:12.67]Yeah, I like that.
[239:13.29]Yeah, let's get a clean slate here on a flat ground.
[239:29.34]Let's do small.
[239:39.42]It's so great.
[239:41.12]Sour please.
[239:51.97]I've seen a lot of sour pleases.
[239:56.37]Alright, let's see if we can turn my computer into dust.
[240:03.45]Let's flatten everything out.
[240:05.23]I need a bigger brush size than that.
[240:11.51]As big as it can be.
[240:12.17]It's gonna be one exhibit only.
[240:32.16]We're not even gonna get this far here.
[240:33.57]I hope that looks good.
[240:38.09]So, where is the penguin?
[240:42.95]Alright, Rock Hopper Penguin?
[240:44.34]How big are you?
[240:44.84]Kind of small.
[240:47.94]Emperor Penguin.
[240:50.77]Start in the corner.
[241:13.11]Well, this is gonna be bad.
[241:14.27]This is gonna stop in about five seconds.
[241:23.30]I'm just creating the opening scene from Happy Feet.
[241:57.85]How was my day?
[241:58.45]It was good.
[242:00.43]Just kind of relaxing.
[242:01.83]Just having a chill day today.
[242:04.47]They're not all dudes, it's... Look, see?
[242:30.33]You want me to go faster than that?
[242:31.47]I can do it.
[242:34.14]I can do it.
[242:34.68]I can do it.
[242:35.06]Hold on.
[242:35.38]I can do it.
[242:35.84]I can do it.
[242:36.20]Nobody move.
[242:36.70]Don't move!
[243:09.98]Now they're moving.
[243:10.76]This hurts already.
[243:12.22]Eat salt.
[243:13.72]No, not eat salt.
[243:50.50]Let's get down to ground level.
[244:02.88]This is fucking dumb.
[244:04.22]I don't know why I thought this was gonna be interesting.
[244:08.13]And presents for everybody!
[244:16.73]Oh, speaking of presents... You, uh...
[244:21.25]Mr. Peanut.
[244:24.25]On Christmas Eve, it's going to be a stream.
[244:30.63]I don't think you're going to want to miss.
[244:33.48]Christmas Eve is the day that the absolutely wonderful Christmas special will be.
[244:38.18]Elf bowling.
[244:44.99]What did I do this for again?
[244:50.91]Oh yeah, put like five tigers in.
[244:57.38]Florida panther in the middle of the tundra.
[245:02.16]Florida in winter.
[245:19.10]we're losing off what are those sounds that's a lion sound that doesn't sound like a lion no that's the penguin why are they going to the presents they don't care about the penguins they just want to open the presents
[246:01.17]He's inside of one.
[246:06.41]It's a birthday party.
[246:07.56]This did not go as planned.
[246:09.46]Oh well.
[246:25.09]Oh my god.
[246:30.96]I may as well play that epic battle simulator.
[246:35.28]Like, that's what I'm trying to do right now.
[246:44.75]What is this?
[246:56.80]Okay, let's see how angry that makes everybody.
[247:03.61]Where did they get the meat?
[247:09.32]Just playing sport.
[247:14.54]Have I really been in this game for four hours?
[247:16.80]Holy shit.
[247:17.74]I just groomed a fish.
[247:39.50]Alright, I think we've peaked here.
[247:49.95]It's time to open the zoo!
[247:52.03]That's right!
[247:53.76]Come on in everybody!
[247:55.72]What the fuck are they doing?
[247:59.22]What are you doing over here?
[248:16.86]Come on in.
[248:17.44]It already is open.
[248:18.58]People looking over the railing and going, no thanks.
[248:25.16]Club penguin.
[248:28.95]Wait, whoa, he just dove in.
[248:32.33]This guy just dove in here.
[248:36.29]What is going on in the center?
[248:52.04]Alright, water bowl.
[248:59.99]They're all stuck on each other.
[249:00.99]They can't move.
[249:07.95]I'll put a cage around them.
[249:09.21]No, that's cruel.
[249:10.05]I think this one's dead.
[249:21.95]No, no one's eating anybody.
[249:23.13]They're just sleeping and playing with presents and having birthday parties and not doing anything else.
[249:36.74]Alright, that's it for that.
[249:44.66]Sell the fish.
[249:53.49]Zoo Tycoon 1 has more murder.
[249:59.81]More murder.
[250:06.60]What time does the... What time does the Red Dead beta start tomorrow?
[250:17.37]Anybody know?
[250:25.29]That's the end of the stream voice coming up here.
[250:33.03]It's just out.
[250:33.57]Okay.
[250:39.56]The end of the stream voice.
[250:49.95]Let me see.
[250:58.23]Boomer streamer is tired at 8pm.
[251:00.59]No, no, that's not what it is.
[251:09.07]What can I do for another hour or so?
[251:13.01]Because I can't play Red Dead.
[251:14.19]I want to do that tomorrow.
[251:15.96]So, Red Dead will be tomorrow.
[251:18.70]And then... Friday...
[251:24.84]Uh, what the fuck am I?
[251:25.72]Oh yeah, I think I might do Dreamcast on Friday.
[251:28.47]I might pull it out.
[251:41.22]Red Dead?
[251:41.70]Yeah, you know, I could play single player in Red Dead to prepare for tomorrow.
[251:45.12]But...
[251:47.01]I don't know.
[251:47.97]Hey, let me do this.
[251:50.51]It's been like four and a half hours almost.
[251:52.47]Let me grab a water.
[251:54.23]And I'll be right back.
[251:56.41]And we can figure out what the hell we're going to do.
[252:00.31]See you in a second.
