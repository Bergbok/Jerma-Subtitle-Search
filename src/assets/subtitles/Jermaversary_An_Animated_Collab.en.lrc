[00:03.24]How long can you survive?
[00:04.32]Just tap only the pumpkin head.
[00:08.37]Tap only the pumpkin head.
[00:25.25]It was a screamer.
[00:26.23]It was a fucking screamer.
[00:28.97]Next.
[00:29.89]Next.
[00:31.53]No, I don't.
[00:31.81]I'm sorry.
[00:32.01]Walk.
[00:32.11]Ride your bike.
[00:32.53]Take a right.
[00:55.33]Excuse me, where is the hospital?
[00:57.59]In front of you.
[00:58.79]Can you show me on the map?
[01:00.60]Right here.
[01:01.22]Look.
[01:01.74]What's the best way to get to the airport?
[01:04.28]Uh, by- take an Uber.
[01:05.28]What's the fastest way to the airport?
[01:07.38]Get in an Uber.
[01:07.96]Get an Uber and it's quick.
[01:08.80]How far is it to the stadium from here?
[01:11.00]Uh, 15 miles.
[01:12.10]What street is this?
[01:13.56]This is, uh... Is this the way to the police station?
[01:16.51]No.
[01:17.19]You're on your way to the stadium.
[01:18.09]Is there a supermarket near here?
[01:19.81]There are.
[01:20.15]There are- there's- Can you give me directions to the gas station?
[01:23.72]Yes, if you take a left at the end of this road and you go straight... Yes, go straight ahead.
[01:26.68]That's right.
[01:28.15]Yeah.
[01:29.83]Well, no, that's not correct.
[01:30.83]No, no, no.
[01:31.89]No, no, I don't know why you're doing this.
[01:34.77]You asked me for directions.
[01:37.10]Well, that's where you should go, then.
[01:38.16]You should go to the bus station and get on the bus.
[01:40.26]I'm not driving a car.
[01:41.02]We are not in a car together.
[01:48.36]What do you do?
[01:49.64]Name something you need a lot of if you have a large family.
[01:52.86]I swear to God, if this answer is love, I'm going to put a hole through my screen.
[02:00.11]Don't fucking be love.
[02:01.95]You already got the cheeky answer in there.
[02:03.97]Who's the one person that wrote love?
[02:05.97]And like, you know, when they asked them, they said love and they winked.
[02:09.27]It's going to be love.
[02:11.06]Mm-hmm.
[02:11.64]Yeah.
[02:12.08]Oh, yeah.
[02:12.44]Love, you know.
[02:13.38]Wink.
[02:15.16]One person.
[02:15.52]It's going to be one.
[02:16.22]One person.
[02:17.75]Fucking assholes.
[02:18.43]Oh yeah, you know, you need lots of patience, you need lots of love.
[02:21.60]We're three people that said this.
[02:23.32]And we like, we like said it and then grabbed the person like on the shoulder and we're like, hey, you know what I mean?
[02:28.14]Love.
[02:29.38]And then they like tripped and dropped their fucking coffee and the rest of their day sucked.
[02:32.71]They like stepped in a fucking huge puddle after they said that.
[02:35.09]They were like, oh yeah, love, wink.
[02:36.51]Thank you for your time.
[02:37.39]Yeah, I'll see you later.
[02:38.29]Thank, oh yeah, I gave you some good answers.
[02:39.73]Some really specific shitty ones.
[02:41.24]Yeah, see you later.
[02:42.02]And they turn and fucking go in the puddle and it fucking goes all over their fucking pants and shit and their coffee goes everywhere and the rest of their day is terrible.
[02:48.66]Let's go ahead and check out.
[02:52.04]Ladies and gentlemen, it's been 30 seconds.
[02:56.90]You know what that means.
[02:58.74]It's time for some free shit.
[03:04.14]That's right.
[03:05.18]All you viewers that have been here for so long, there's a chance.
[03:09.44]Here comes the free shit.
[03:12.28]Let's roll the dice and see who won.
[03:18.12]Okay.
[03:20.02]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the free shit was me.
[03:41.65]I think peeing in the shower is like- gets a bad rap, guys.
[03:51.13]Oh, that's- oh, that's disgusting.
[03:53.09]Not if you piss right onto the drain.
[03:56.40]Like, if you piss directly onto the- right in the metal part of the drain, like, it doesn't matter, it's going to the same place.
[04:02.05]Oh, disgusting!
[04:02.79]It's going into the sewer!
[04:03.95]When I was a kid... When I was a kid, I used to turn the shower on and be outside of the shower.
[04:15.05]I would turn, pull my pants down, and piss into the shower.
[04:22.23]I did that for a long time.
[04:23.55]There's a toilet right behind me.
[04:27.33]Turn the shower on, and I guess I'm just gonna piss into the bathtub.
[04:30.93]I don't know why, I just was easier for some reason.
[04:38.23]Who invited this guy?
[04:39.31]Do you know who he is?
[04:40.63]And you know what it is?
[04:41.79]It's because the bathtub is a giant urinal.
[04:44.53]You don't have to aim.
