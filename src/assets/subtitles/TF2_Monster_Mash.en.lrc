[00:07.07]Oh dear god.
[00:09.47]Oh dear god.
[00:11.79]Oh my god.
[00:17.27]Well, that ain't happening.
[00:20.14]If you die to Monoculus, or to one of us, we're just going to one point that.
[00:25.86]Okay.
[00:26.54]And we'll play until, I don't know, some number.
[00:30.64]Alright, so if you die by Monoculus, do you lose a point?
[00:35.31]No matter how you die, like, if you die, I get a point.
[00:37.59]Doesn't matter how you die.
[00:38.75]Then hold on, I'm gonna spawn a whole bunch of Monoculus.
[00:41.30]Hold on, no, wait, let's get, like, on the same playing field here before you do that.
[00:46.18]No.
[00:47.10]And then I'm gonna count down and say go.
[00:55.02]Oh, jeez.
[00:57.50]Okay, are you ready?
[00:58.40]You're gonna break the server.
[01:01.22]Are you ready?
[01:01.92]I'm ready.
[01:02.74]I'm ready.
[01:03.66]Okay, go then.
[01:04.64]First person to ten.
[01:11.53]Okay, that's one point for me.
[01:13.61]No, it's not.
[01:14.67]It's impossible.
[01:16.35]I went off the cliff.
[01:18.25]It's not possible.
[01:20.33]You're on a chain.
[01:22.21]You don't...
[01:24.29]Alright, there you are, I see you, I see you.
[01:26.63]Damn it!
[01:27.09]Oh my god, first shot!
[01:29.61]Is it really 0-2?
[01:31.11]It's 2-1.
[01:31.95]I had no clips off the cliff, which will count.
[01:35.47]Alright, so it's 2-1.
[01:39.31]Here's the strat to dodge a binoculars.
[01:41.91]You gotta go inside buildings.
[01:45.31]Dear.
[01:46.73]Oh, he hit you.
[01:47.65]Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.
[01:49.68]Where are you?
[01:52.08]I don't know, I can't find you.
[01:53.56]Seriously, my brain cannot handle this right now.
[01:56.72]Oh, there you are.
[01:58.38]Oh, here's the cheat.
[01:59.14]Here's what you do.
[02:00.16]We're developing a meta.
[02:02.36]If you see an Oculus shooting, they're probably shooting at the other person.
[02:07.04]Oh, yeah, that's true.
[02:11.57]The difficulty in landing one of these shots.
[02:13.93]Oh, something hit me.
[02:14.67]I love how it's playing the music and everything.
[02:24.18]No!
[02:27.02]Yes, yes!
[02:28.46]2-2.
[02:29.00]This is so hard.
[02:30.22]Maybe we- oh, god damn it!
[02:33.30]3-2, you.
[02:35.42]Monoculus is leaving in 10 seconds.
[02:37.16]Monoculus is leaving in 10 seconds.
[02:40.83]It's okay, I think there's enough Monoculus.
[02:45.61]That really is such a good strategy, you see where the Monoculuses are all looking.
[02:50.15]It's so stupid because we're not even just dodging each other.
[02:52.63]You just don't know how many missiles are coming towards you.
[02:55.87]There's a lot going towards you.
[03:01.70]Oh, come on.
[03:02.76]Stop hitting them like Bon.
[03:05.98]That just grazed right by me.
[03:08.66]Oh, man.
[03:12.06]3-3.
[03:12.56]You got little wings on your pyro and everything.
[03:14.93]Yeah, I got the- I got the 10% wing flight.
[03:16.49]Alright, I gotta go towards you.
[03:18.73]I love how there's just one, like, horseman just being like a dipshit, running around doing absolutely nothing.
[03:24.56]That guy's doing absolutely nothing.
[03:30.44]Ooh!
[03:31.64]That's an air shot.
[03:39.22]No, Cliff, get out there, quick!
[03:41.41]Was it 3-3?
[03:42.35]3-2.
[03:42.61]Oh, no, it's 4-2, because I died to a binoculars.
[03:45.93]Oh, you did?
[03:46.77]Yep.
[03:47.25]I didn't even know that.
[03:48.19]Thank you.
[03:52.46]Yes.
[03:53.58]There's, like, no perp.
[03:55.38]I can't tell what's going on.
[03:59.34]Because the eyeballs look like they're rockets.
[04:02.38]Look behind you!
[04:04.28]There's just so many missiles.
[04:07.58]Wow.
[04:08.44]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[04:10.74]What, time out?
[04:12.30]No time out.
[04:13.86]No time out.
[04:15.10]No time out.
[04:16.96]What are you doing?
[04:17.60]What are you spawning?
[04:19.64]There weren't enough of them.
[04:20.74]Yeah, there weren't enough of them.
[04:22.06]You're coming after you.
[04:23.58]I'm just going to play the dodging game for a little bit.
[04:27.41]All these eyeballs will get you.
[04:28.83]All these, like, grapes.
[04:35.47]This is so hard to do this.
[04:39.51]I honestly cannot believe the server has not crashed.
[04:41.87]How has the server not crashed?
[04:43.11]You'd be surprised how much the server can take of this.
[04:45.87]No.
[04:47.55]I, like, have lost count.
[04:49.26]Yeah, someone's going to watch this and be like, you guys do not know what math is.
[04:54.08]I just spilled my coffee because of that.
[04:55.58]Damn it.
[04:57.05]Why did I pick up my coffee mug with two hands and hit it on the ground?
[05:00.17]What am I doing?
[05:03.15]Yeah, it's like 4-4, or I don't even know anymore.
[05:06.63]Like, oh, let's play to 10.
[05:07.98]All these binoculars just, like, fucked it all up.
[05:10.14]Because, like, I have no idea what's happening.
[05:13.90]Well, you're ahead now.
[05:15.88]You have to be.
[05:16.42]I've died twice in the last, like, two seconds to binoculars.
[05:19.10]I think it's like 6-4 right now.
[05:23.96]Yeah...
[05:27.02]Look, they're all, like, going down this hill.
[05:30.80]Yeah, why are they doing that?
[05:31.72]Why are they all going down?
[05:33.87]They're all, like, regressing down here.
[05:37.19]Oh my god.
[05:39.21]Why am I standing still?
[05:40.49]I'm, like, staring at the monoculuses.
[05:42.31]I don't know.
[05:45.41]We should play zombie mode after this, too, where I just make a ton of horsemen and whoever survives the longest as scout.
[05:57.55]Whoa, I left, like, the whole map.
[06:02.65]Oh, we have 30 seconds to do whatever we need to do.
[06:05.29]Well, who knows who has how many points?
[06:07.09]Oh, wait.
[06:07.55]Alright.
[06:07.95]Okay, I've died seven times, and I've had five kills.
[06:11.67]Well, it doesn't count all of them, because Monoculus has killed who how many times?
[06:15.89]Well, that's deaths.
[06:16.67]I've died seven times, so you have seven points.
[06:18.61]Oh, I have six deaths.
[06:19.95]Yeah, so it's five.
[06:20.83]So, yeah, there you go.
[06:21.73]Wow!
[06:22.17]It's built into the game?
[06:23.51]Is this an FPS?
[06:25.95]Oh, I had my plane throw out.
[06:30.02]What the fuck was that?
[06:31.24]The horseman hit you!
[06:32.32]And he's on the ground!
[06:34.24]That's impossible!
[06:35.74]That's impossible!
[06:37.76]That is impossible!
[06:38.80]The horseman can't hit me!
[06:40.05]I'm like 30 feet above him!
[06:42.21]Okay, well, it ended 6 to 8.
[06:43.71]We didn't even get to 10.
[06:45.19]Alright, well, whatever.
[06:46.15]You win.
[06:47.15]We're doing the new game mode now.
[06:52.76]I better start running.
[06:54.59]See you later.
[06:55.77]See you later.
[07:04.56]I'm actually curious to see what they're owing about.
[07:09.80]I'm going back to check.
[07:11.48]Where are they?
[07:13.44]Did they all jump off?
[07:14.85]Hold on.
[07:18.22]Because really, I think they just start fighting each other.
[07:24.63]No.
[07:25.35]Yeah.
[07:28.05]I don't think this game boat's gonna work.
[07:30.29]This is not gonna work.
[07:32.01]First person to make it to the other spawn.
[07:34.81]Okay.
[07:35.57]You ready?
[07:36.19]Yeah.
[07:37.49]Do it.
[07:39.97]Only have to make it to the spawn.
[07:47.60]This is so eerie.
[07:51.54]Stop airblasting me.
[07:52.50]Stop it!
[07:54.86]You said, I'm dead.
[07:57.28]We made it pretty far.
[07:59.40]Why is this guy shooting so fast?
[08:01.84]I'm dead.
[08:04.20]I'm gonna make it.
[08:05.80]You're not gonna make it.
[08:06.94]Oh, I'm gonna... Fuck!
[08:07.82]He was right in front of me!
[08:08.68]He was right... Alright, let's go.
[08:12.58]We should go down the left cliff here.
[08:14.36]Let's coordinate.
[08:14.90]Okay.
[08:18.47]Alright, go inside.
[08:19.89]Hold on, get your bearings, get your bearings.
[08:22.33]Wow, watch out, watch out.
[08:23.24]Oh, dude, there's one to the left, too.
[08:25.36]There's like three down there.
[08:26.78]There's like three over here.
[08:28.60]It's alright.
[08:29.60]We got to find like a stopping point down here.
[08:31.20]No, no, don't go in there.
[08:32.12]There's one in there.
[08:35.76]Dude, hold on.
[08:36.90]No.
[08:37.98]I had to go.
[08:38.74]I had to go.
[08:40.24]Just keep going.
[08:41.91]I wonder if you're going to make it.
[08:44.91]I want to see if you make it.
[08:46.86]There's a few in here, I don't think I can make it through this room.
[08:50.74]Where are you?
[08:51.24]Are you underneath?
[08:54.52]They didn't shoot, they didn't shoot!
[08:55.92]Oh, you're right there.
[08:59.02]Come on!
[08:59.96]You can do it!
[09:02.32]Oh, you're in trouble!
[09:03.53]No, he like came down to block me!
[09:07.27]You almost made it too.
[09:08.31]I know, that was pretty far.
[09:11.25]One more time.
[09:12.11]You ready?
[09:13.13]Merasmus is literally right around the corner.
[09:15.15]Let's go.
[09:15.49]Wait, why is he... No, no!
[09:19.78]Kill him.
[09:20.56]Kill Merasmus.
[09:23.26]Okay, this is to earn.
[09:24.14]You ready?
[09:25.16]Just let's go.
[09:25.72]Let's go.
[09:26.38]Two, one, go.
[09:26.92]Go, go.
[09:29.32]Nice!
[09:29.70]Merasmus, just try to get away from him.
[09:33.06]I got away.
[09:33.50]I got away from Merasmus.
[09:35.54]Did you make it out?
[09:36.40]Yeah.
[09:39.39]He's chasing.
[09:39.97]He's right behind you.
[09:41.53]He really is.
[09:43.75]Get away from me.
[09:47.21]Oh, you got knocked into the corner.
[09:48.51]Only reason I'm alive is because they were shooting at you.
[09:51.17]Dude, Merasmus just totally screwed me right there.
[09:53.80]He like jump scared me.
[09:54.90]That was bullshit.
[09:59.22]Are you going to get out?
[10:00.34]No, you're dead.
[10:02.24]There's one in the floor there.
[10:04.22]That's what hit me.
[10:07.20]Whoa.
[10:13.64]I'm spotting it on blue.
[10:15.72]It's not possible.
[10:17.14]It's not possible.
[10:18.90]Impossible.
[10:19.38]Here I come.
[10:19.94]Impossible.
[10:20.40]Here's my try.
[10:23.50]Impossible.
[10:26.88]Not possible.
[10:29.07]Well, I've got some range on him.
[10:31.01]Oh, I see.
[10:31.47]You're over here.
[10:33.11]You got just... Oh, and I looked at you blowing up, and it was just too much.
[10:39.73]Oh, my God.
[10:40.45]My frame rate.
[10:41.07]I'm up on the cliff.
[10:43.80]What cliff are you on?
[10:45.68]The cliff.
[10:46.68]I'm just gonna watch this.
[10:49.06]No!
[10:49.30]I can't- I can't watch it.
[10:50.36]They're shooting me.
[10:53.24]You can't beat them!
[10:54.50]No, it's a- this is- Okay, no, no.
[10:56.46]I'm stepping it up.
[10:58.63]Want some of this?
[11:00.21]This whole server is going down.
[11:07.83]I can't even follow you, you're moving around so fast.
[11:12.74]Not available.
[11:13.64]You know what you've successfully made?
[11:15.74]You have successfully made a bullet hell game.
[11:19.23]This is a bullet hell game.
[11:21.61]One hit and you're dead and you have like a bunch of ridiculous powerful shooting gun.
[11:29.88]They're all spread out.
[11:30.56]I'm actually taking care of them.
[11:32.18]Behind you, there's a ton underneath you.
[11:34.76]Why do they all go down the hill?
[11:37.44]I went off the cliff.
[11:38.30]Okay.
[11:39.68]Okay.
[11:40.04]Three, two, one, go.
[11:49.65]Dude.
[11:54.33]I'm out of bullets.
[11:58.88]It's surprisingly hard, isn't it?
[12:02.98]How did you get the ammo?
[12:03.92]I was spamming the heck out of it.
[12:07.91]How is this more difficult than the one we were doing earlier?
[12:10.59]Because we're, like, keeping our distance from each other.
[12:13.21]You can barely aim these two.
[12:15.65]Get them out of ammo.
[12:18.57]Yes!
[12:20.63]I was going to come at you with, like, the melee.
[12:23.15]We're going to play first to three.
[12:24.83]Okay.
[12:27.92]First to three.
[12:30.46]See, actually, it's...
[12:32.91]It's actually easier to dodge your crits.
[12:35.51]This is what makes it harder, because we're doing it in straight lines.
[12:38.37]Like, oh yeah, I could just dodge that straight line.
[12:42.19]Dodge this.
[12:45.73]Dodge this asshole.
[12:46.49]I don't know where I'm aiming.
[12:50.17]Give me the ammo.
[12:52.19]Did I get it?
[12:52.85]Yes.
[12:53.83]I saw you zoom underneath me through the ground.
[12:58.47]Oh my god.
[13:00.43]Shit.
[13:01.67]That's 2-0.
[13:05.00]I'm going to shoot on sight.
[13:07.36]Where are you?
[13:08.86]Where are you?
[13:10.84]Where the hell are you?
[13:11.92]There you are.
[13:12.56]There he is.
[13:20.35]Raining hell.
[13:24.99]Are you... Did you go behind and underneath?
[13:27.65]I went through the walls.
[13:28.97]Oh, fuck me.
[13:32.49]It's too much for my brain to handle.
[13:45.22]My payload's about to get destroyed.
[13:47.89]Money!
