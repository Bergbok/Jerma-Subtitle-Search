[45:03.67]I think we're ready.
[45:04.35]We're just waiting for Neat to join.
[45:07.16]Alright, come on Neat, let's get it.
[45:10.05]What does the audience do in this one?
[45:11.75]I don't know.
[45:16.75]When the rapture hits, all the peats will be easy.
[45:20.78]Soap tastes like cilantro.
[45:26.44]It's alright, I don't mind it.
[45:28.34]Where are the sub sounds?
[45:29.76]Oh, they should be here.
[45:31.74]I don't know, maybe I'm just a fucking dumb shithead.
[45:38.82]There we go.
[45:41.34]Neat, did you color in the whole screen?
[45:43.00]Is that what took you so long?
[45:44.63]If you look at your devices right now, you should see a secret prompt just for you.
[45:49.47]Stuff that's kind of hard to draw.
[45:51.99]Like Cat Inception.
[45:53.77]Or, I don't know, a flatus.
[45:56.73]Draw a picture on your device that would have that title.
[45:59.61]And when you're done, hit send.
[46:01.69]You'll get points for each player that can correctly guess your title.
[46:04.79]So, go!
[46:06.43]Do it!
[46:08.69]No cheating.
[46:09.39]Don't write the answer.
[46:11.53]Don't write it.
[46:31.15]Whatever.
[46:31.43]I don't give a shit.
[46:32.37]Whatever, who cares.
[46:33.05]You gotta just draw the thing that's on the screen.
[46:37.72]Just draw whatever the best way you can to do it, Dave.
[46:39.86]As quick as you can.
[46:40.80]Alright, let's see.
[46:45.13]In before stream ban.
[46:55.71]Oh, you better believe I am ready to, I am ready to fucking close this capture device.
[47:03.46]Don't be a fucking dickhead.
[47:06.06]PG-16.

[47:25.07]It's like overriding this whole thing.
[47:27.07]What is this?
[47:28.69]It looks like a bowtie.
[47:34.73]I'm going to say bowtie.
[47:41.19]I don't know.
[47:44.97]I'm going to try to drop it.

[50:02.87]I hope that's a tail.
[50:04.67]I really hope that's a tail.
[50:08.14]If that ain't a tail, then something's going on that I don't know.
[50:11.08]Could be.
