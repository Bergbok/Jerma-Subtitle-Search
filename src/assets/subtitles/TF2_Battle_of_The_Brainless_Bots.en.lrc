[00:04.73]German, I'm already just so exhausted from even trying to put this together.
[00:13.62]There hasn't been an ounce of enthusiasm in my voice since we started talking about this, but now we're ready.
[00:17.96]I sent you the info.
[00:18.66]Let's do this.
[00:20.64]You, like, do not want to do this at all.
[00:25.00]I almost, like, threw up.
[00:26.60]Did you hear that?
[00:27.20]A little bit, yeah.
[00:29.43]So, here's what the deal is, right?
[00:31.83]So here's Star, he's the soldier right here.
[00:34.50]He's on red team, I'm on blue team, this is upward.
[00:37.30]We are going to both have a team of easy mode bots.
[00:41.42]That means our bots are at the lowest difficulty they could possibly be at.
[00:45.63]And why is there a tank?
[00:47.79]This feels familiar.
[00:48.71]Easy bots.
[00:50.99]So...
[00:53.76]No, no, don't break your own fucking server!
[01:01.32]Can you give me one second to explain what's happening?
[01:07.67]Yes.
[01:09.13]Look at this mess.
[01:12.37]I can't believe you made a trail to yourself.
[01:16.38]It's GTA!
[01:18.32]Yeah, I really didn't think you were ever gonna be able to do this.
[01:23.48]You brought the truck punchline over into Team Fortress 2 and your service is gonna crash.
[01:30.84]There's no way we're making out of this one.
[01:33.25]This place is shutting down.
[01:36.55]Shit's like flying by my screen.
[01:39.57]Oh no, we invested our money poorly.
[01:42.57]We didn't put it into a 401k.
[01:44.91]It's disappearing!
[01:47.44]All of our money is disappearing.
[01:49.30]You wanted to invest in a lollipop company.
[01:51.56]It's all gone.
[01:52.64]All right, come on out.
[01:56.90]They are not leaving.
[01:58.22]Oh, yeah, one person is.
[02:00.12]It seems two of them has left.
[02:02.83]They're a little bit delayed.
[02:04.99]They're making some progress.
[02:06.03]Don't worry.
[02:06.49]We have our sentry set up in a very optimal situation with a scout not moving, standing next to it.
[02:14.22]Oh, I think my guys are pushing in.
[02:16.00]We got a heavy medic combination coming in through the front control point here.
[02:19.35]Pyro coming out here.
[02:20.15]Looks like... Do you see your spy?
[02:22.85]No, I'm watching the action.
[02:24.21]He was just standing still.
[02:25.93]There is no action.
[02:26.43]What are they doing?
[02:27.43]Robert Heavy is not doing anything.
[02:28.93]What are they doing?
[02:31.13]What is he still doing?
[02:32.48]He's out of bullets, I think.
[02:35.60]Oh, okay.
[02:38.84]I'm going to pay attention to something else.
[02:40.54]Why are they doing a melee fight?
[02:43.75]Are you kidding me right now?
[02:47.42]What the fuck?
[02:49.50]Did you seriously make every single person a spy?
[02:52.00]Yes.
[02:53.22]Oh my god.
[02:55.00]What are they doing?
[02:55.84]What is your team doing?
[02:58.62]What are... Why are they freaking out in the corner over here?
[03:02.49]That's just what spies do.
[03:04.59]This is what you should be aiming for.
[03:06.31]Oh, make sure you're disguised.
[03:09.35]Make sure he doesn't see you.
[03:10.61]I just heard like...
[03:13.72]Ten seconds.
[03:15.58]I wonder if one... Why are they trying to jump through the boards?
[03:19.58]That doesn't work like that.
[03:20.66]You're not, like, made out of taffy.
[03:23.44]Here we go!
[03:24.24]Um... Um... Here they come!
[03:31.01]I'm unstoppable!
[03:33.87]Don't even tell... Please don't tell me they're all gonna keep coming out of this door.
[03:37.89]Where else would they go?
[03:38.96]I don't know.
[03:39.64]There's only one option.
[03:41.10]I just... I go out this door.
[03:44.24]I think you like broke them.
[03:47.00]Hold on.
[03:47.88]Let me see where they are.
[03:49.20]Are they done?
[03:50.20]No, they're all going out the front door.
[03:51.68]Okay, this is stupid.
[03:53.29]Nobody's even attacking.
[04:00.83]You don't want to tell me what stupid is.
[04:04.36]No, they're going after each other.
[04:12.27]Did you get backstabbed?
[04:13.25]I got backstabbed.
[04:14.59]There was one too many of them.
[04:16.83]No one's even gonna go for the point.
[04:18.61]This is gonna last exactly 3 minutes and 32 seconds.
[04:22.24]Because there's absolutely no way any of these brainless son of a bitches are gonna go for that point.
[04:29.02]Okay, this one engineer is really just going for gold.
[04:34.07]We actually capped it.
[04:35.69]How the hell did that happen?
[04:37.02]I don't know, maybe it had something to do with the tank.
[04:41.42]They just crushed that guy!
[04:45.72]It's just going through.
[04:47.70]They're all gonna get stuck on it.
[04:49.14]They're all just shooting it like, what the hell is this blocking the door?
[04:52.75]Yeah, this guy's freaking out.
[04:54.17]I'm about to get trickstabbed.
[04:55.33]No, no, no.
[04:56.67]Is it actually making its way in?
[04:58.57]No, it's not, is it?
[05:00.27]Please crush them, please crush them!
[05:02.67]You go, like, crushing them.
[05:05.05]No, don't!
[05:06.43]No, my god!
[05:07.87]No, it didn't kill him!
[05:08.95]They got it in!
[05:09.81]They got it in!
[05:29.38]I'm gonna die!
[05:30.92]I'm gonna die!
[05:35.29]This should not have happened.
[05:38.59]They're actually doing enough damage to it.
[05:40.55]Here, you see the engineers on the back of the tanks?
[05:45.98]Yes.
[05:48.28]Oh my god.
[05:51.18]Oh, you didn't think this could get even dumber.
[05:53.48]It's kinetic.
[05:55.30]Dude, they just keep getting run over.
[06:03.16]Alright, redo.
[06:06.29]Retake.
[06:07.47]Redo.
[06:07.91]I need like a second before I throw up.
[06:11.87]Why are they all taunting?
[06:16.01]They don't even know to shoot yet.
[06:17.47]Why are they not shooting you?
[06:20.37]Because the round hasn't started.
[06:21.45]I'm not supposed to be out here.
[06:23.07]Oh, they're that confused about the round not being started yet.
[06:26.51]That they refuse to shoot you.
[06:30.05]What are they... This doesn't make any... Wait, hold on.
[06:32.96]I want to see what happens in one second.
[06:39.68]How is anybody on blue team going to get anything done?
[06:43.69]You have such a huge advantage because you're allowed to build your sentries first.
[06:48.27]My guys are being like dumbasses trying to do like leapfrog in the spawn.
[06:52.06]Hey, you could be a little bit more respectful.
[06:56.04]Just wait.
[06:56.54]Wait till this 12 seconds counts down.
[06:59.30]I bet you every single one of these guys just walks out and just gets eaten alive.
[07:03.83]Eaten alive by what?
[07:05.17]We barely have a defense.
[07:06.91]The sentry mosquitoes.
[07:09.63]Alright, here we go, here we go, let's see.
[07:10.51]Why do you need a catchphrase for everything?
[07:11.97]Here we go, let's see what happens.
[07:13.41]Oh, this is gonna work.
[07:14.77]This is gonna work.
[07:15.35]They all backed up instantly, like, nah.
[07:17.78]Nah, let's just build them back here.
[07:19.28]Let's start getting these teleporters up.
[07:22.20]They're so confused.
[07:22.94]Just prioritizing the teleporters over centuries.
[07:25.62]Yeah, they'd rather build teleporters than centuries.
[07:28.80]There's... No, seriously!
[07:30.34]This was done!
[07:32.22]The joke was over!
[07:35.66]That joke ended so long ago!
[07:41.25]Why do you have to fucking ruin everything?
