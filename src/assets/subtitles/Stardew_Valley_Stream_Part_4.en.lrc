[00:11.11]Fall 11th, year one.
[00:15.29]Greg's farm.
[00:19.59]14, 14, 14.
[00:20.55]Hey, guys.
[00:31.08]My eats were good.
[00:31.86]I had a chicken gyro.
[00:34.74]It was fantastic.
[00:41.95]Empty response.
[00:44.22]Oh, Nightbot's been drinking again.
[00:45.50]We haven't even started the stream.
[00:47.74]We just began.
[00:48.46]A chicken gyro.
[00:54.86]Or gyro.
[00:55.72]I don't know.
[00:56.20]How do you pronounce it?
[00:58.20]I'm pretty sure it's gyro, right?
[01:00.26]Something like that.
[01:01.26]It's a gyro.
[01:12.25]I completely forgot I had $15,000.
[01:14.45]That's a lot of money.
[01:23.06]I think you think I'm right.
[01:23.82]I think I'm right.
[01:24.30]Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm right.
[01:27.72]Every time you order a gyro from a different restaurant, they call it something else.
[01:32.90]Some people call it gyro, gyro, gyro, gyro.
[01:35.94]It's like, I just want to order a chicken wrap that has the tzatziki sauce in it.
[01:41.08]Come on.
[01:42.55]Alright!
[01:44.20]Where we left off last time... What were we doing?
[01:48.54]Grapes?
[01:49.84]Crab pots?
[01:51.20]Bees?
[01:55.52]Fires?
[01:58.16]Holy shit, I have 93 berries.
[01:59.36]What was I doing with these?
[02:02.32]Did I have a reason?
[02:03.56]I forget.
[02:04.16]Everything.
[02:07.54]We're just gonna... I'm just gonna keep these.
[02:12.77]Maybe prices will go up.
[02:14.79]And I'll just corner the market like crazy.
[02:21.01]On the new video.
[02:24.57]I was contemplating what the response to that video was going to be.
[02:30.44]But, you know, it is what it is.
[02:32.72]I wanted to keep these.
[02:35.34]Oh yeah, there's a festival coming in like three days.
[02:39.24]I wanted these, so that's four, five, six...
[02:43.92]7, 8, 9.
[02:44.44]Okay, we're gonna do four golden cranberries, two golden blackberries, and maybe a jar of honey?
[02:55.00]Do you all want to see the private pile?
[02:56.74]I threw them in the trash!
[03:00.88]No one's gonna see those.
[03:01.74]Okay.
[03:08.40]Let's work on a friendship, huh?
[03:11.44]Actually, I want more beehives.
[03:15.33]coal.
[03:15.67]I need coal.
[03:16.37]Do I have any more than eight coal?
[03:22.11]No.
[03:22.57]Alright, boys.
[03:24.29]Boys and girls, we are going into the mine, because I want to make, like, at least five more beehives.
[03:28.67]Let's go check on our bait.
[03:32.73]Wait, actually, I gotta water these.
[03:33.69]Water the grapes.
[03:44.45]Mouse has to move, of course.
[03:47.01]Always, every time.
[03:52.30]Why does it look like that didn't get hit?
[03:54.44]Like this one over here didn't either.
[04:01.83]The meteor has just become part of the fence now.
[04:06.33]That has turned into a decoration that I'm keeping there.
[04:13.15]How much longer do we have in fall?
[04:16.27]Like another 18 days or something?
[04:27.27]How long does it take to get cranberries?
[04:31.95]After you pick cranberries for the first time, how long does it take for them to come back?
[04:38.03]Yes, you can water multiple squares if you have an upgraded can.
[04:43.45]Which I have.
[04:47.13]Although I could probably do with a better upgrade.
[04:52.63]Oh shit.
[04:55.17]My back has been hurting too.
[04:56.55]Anybody get like back pain?
[04:59.23]My lower right back is killing me lately.
[05:04.60]I'm gonna have to talk to my physician about it.
[05:09.60]Aren't your kidneys back there?
[05:13.58]Where are your kidneys?
[05:14.23]Your kidneys are like in the back right.
[05:15.95]In the back left, right?
[05:21.23]Whatever it is, it sucks.
[05:26.68]Might have a bad kidney.
[05:27.50]Well, that would suck.
[05:30.10]I don't want to think about that.
[05:32.48]Don't you only need one?
[05:33.22]I'll just take real good care of my left one.
[05:45.39]It's the slouching.
[05:46.23]No, but I feel like it's not.
[05:49.86]I feel like this started happening even before I was a slouch.
[05:56.92]It's just an ache.
[05:58.28]It's not like, ah, god, it's killing me.
[05:59.97]It's just an achy, annoying pain.
[06:05.95]Diagnosis time.
[06:07.55]With the chat.
[06:09.23]Am I actually ready to go to bed?
[06:10.63]Are you serious?
[06:14.42]Oh, back to bed.
[06:17.07]Yeah, we might even go back to bed and then back to bed again.
[06:23.21]I can't.
[06:23.49]I don't have enough energy to pick up this corn.
[06:27.55]Or do I?
[06:30.01]What?
[06:32.01]There's corn on these husks.
[06:34.11]Right?
[06:34.77]I can see it.
[06:35.35]Why can I not pick it up?
[06:37.71]What?
[06:40.67]That was dumb.
[06:46.40]Yeah, we're going back to bed.
[06:48.22]Back to bed.
[06:49.70]Back to back to bed.
[06:58.53]Back to back to bed.
[07:02.37]One time I ate way too many pistachios and both my kidneys hurt.
[07:05.63]Well, it's not both.
[07:06.25]There's only just one side.
[07:07.67]And I'm not even going to say it's my kidneys because I'm a total hypochondriac and I will just be like, oh my god, my kidneys are failing.
[07:14.81]My kidneys are ruined.
[07:17.06]I don't even want to get that image in my head right now.
[07:19.06]Well, it's not both.
[07:19.70]There's only just one side.
[07:20.62]What the fuck?
[07:23.26]What?
[07:23.64]What?
[07:23.96]Why?
[07:26.85]I did not touch anything.
[07:27.77]Why did that just do that?
[07:31.65]That was scary.
[07:34.49]This stream has been live for like 10 straight minutes and now all of a sudden I hear myself talking?
[07:42.44]Uh...
[07:47.56]I gotta sell all this crap.
[07:48.78]I was selling all the corn is not that great.
[07:51.48]6.30 a.m.
[07:53.28]Well, that was a tough day.
[07:56.74]Back to bed.
[07:59.06]No, I'm kidding.
[07:59.80]I'm not gonna do that.
[08:04.54]Stream my appendix beam.
[08:05.70]You know, we're gonna go to the spa.
[08:08.27]Stop the day off right.
[08:09.25]You know what I mean?
[08:10.49]Wait, hold on.
[08:10.99]People will yell at me if I don't do this.
[08:16.63]What a cave.
[08:17.15]Any boogers in here?
[08:19.57]Ah, there's one booger in here.
[08:23.55]Although I do already have plenty of boogers.
[08:25.41]I don't really need any more.
[08:26.53]I might just be getting old, too.
[08:32.84]That sucks to think about.
[08:35.54]Am I just at the stage where stuff just hurts because I'm an old person?
[08:41.39]I hope not.
[08:50.30]My next video is going to be home surgery.
[08:56.10]See what you want to do!
[08:56.92]Uh, yes.
[09:08.50]Yes, Jin, I am 30.
[09:12.22]Very recent.
[09:12.82]I'm a very recent graduate of the 29 Club.
[09:17.26]Very recent graduate of the 29 club.
[09:20.30]The college of the 29 year olds.
[09:22.74]I graduated.
[09:28.14]You're 30, not 60.
[09:28.90]I feel 60.
[09:29.56]I gotta get back to the gym.
[09:44.47]You know?
[09:47.27]Said I was 42 in my last stream.
[09:48.93]Well... I'll never tell you my real age.
[10:01.06]It's somewhere in the 30s or 40s.
[10:02.44]Let's see.
[10:11.11]What can I do over here?
[10:14.57]That's not going to get me in trouble.
[10:21.77]Just gonna go back.
[10:22.41]I gotta water my plants again.
[10:23.91]At least this time I have full energy.
[10:25.60]And then I can come back.
[10:26.46]Oh, hey, hey, hey.
[10:27.02]Hold on, hold on.
[10:27.56]Hey.
[10:29.06]Hello?
[10:30.68]Please don't destroy my tent.
[10:32.10]What implied that I was gonna do that?
[10:37.45]Here, have a booger.
[10:41.95]Why would he think I was gonna do that?
[10:46.10]He was scared of me.
[10:49.03]Instead of saying hello, please don't destroy my shit.
[10:51.61]I'm not gonna.
[11:04.44]Have I chosen a wife or a husband?
[11:05.72]I have not.
[11:06.86]No one likes me.
[11:10.20]Linus and Pam are the only two people in the whole town that like me, and Pam is not a bachelorette.
[11:24.34]Let's go down with it, you know?
[11:25.66]Go down with it!
[11:32.44]I really want to know... I know it was definitely not worth it.
[11:38.13]That much I'm certain of.
[11:40.77]For all these grapes.
[11:43.05]But I don't know, I could get some good money from this.
[11:45.67]I do have 70 of them.
[11:49.04]I don't have 10, I have 70.
[11:53.10]And then we can just bulldoze this whole entire farm and just do the honey crab farm that I want to do.
[11:57.55]Because guys, you do understand that in wintertime, this whole thing's getting bulldozed.
[12:05.71]I'm coming in here with a wrecking ball and I'm just trashing the whole place.
[12:14.28]Destroy the tent, your relationship with them will go up.
[12:17.72]I highly doubt that.
[12:27.93]Don't forget about the mayonnaise, I know.
[12:29.25]There's so many things I want to do.
[12:35.80]I wish I would face the right direction instead of moving a slight tiny bit and then have to go the other direction.
[12:43.45]How much is this game?
[12:44.13]I believe it is, what, $14?
[12:46.33]$14.99?
[12:47.51]Something like that?
[12:48.03]Or was it on sale?
[12:48.67]I don't remember.
[12:49.91]It's less than $20.
[13:01.71]I so desperately need those sprinklers, but I'm on this crab thing right now.
[13:10.71]Why did everyone... Wait, the meteorite is not something that's guaranteed?
[13:14.85]You actually cannot get hit by the meteorite?
[13:19.39]I thought that was just part of the storyline.
[13:20.81]Like, I'm gonna break that open and there's gonna be an alien in there.
[13:23.41]I'm gonna get, like, alien plants.
[13:24.59]That's not part of the story?
[13:28.08]Well, okay.
[13:28.94]Okay.
[13:32.81]Well, that sucks that I just landed here.
[13:44.36]You finally get the meteorite.
[13:45.32]What is even in it?
[13:46.28]Should you guys not spoil it, or is it something worthwhile?
[13:51.34]Is that like a rare thing to get that?
[13:52.80]Should I be excited that there's a meteorite in my front lawn?
[13:54.86]I don't know.
[14:10.29]I think that's all of them, right?
[14:11.23]No, I didn't get these.
[14:12.11]Oh, this is... This is giving me back pain.
[14:18.61]We're bulldozing this.
[14:20.21]Like I said, this whole thing's coming down.
[14:28.70]And then we're going back to the spa.
[14:31.74]And then we're going back to bed.
[14:36.68]When is... I should probably check that.
[14:40.64]We're going to the spa and then we're going to go to town.
[14:44.86]I might just go to the store and buy a bunch of those energy drinks.
[14:55.63]Those Coca-Cola rip-offs, whatever they're called.
[15:03.63]No, I'm not slouching right now.
[15:05.13]I am sitting straight up.
[15:07.83]I have to, otherwise my failing kidneys are going to start giving out.
[15:13.14]I've got to stop saying that.
[15:14.14]I'm going to freak myself out.
[15:14.98]I'm going to be in bed.
[15:15.58]I'm going to be lying in bed tonight.
[15:18.26]And I'm going to be drifting off.
[15:20.58]Eyes are going to be closing.
[15:21.49]I'm going to start to be thinking about wonderful things like maple syrup and apple cider.
[15:28.19]And all of a sudden, I'm going to be in a doctor's office.
[15:31.47]It's gonna be like, bang!
[15:33.14]Fuck those pancakes, get them out of there.
[15:34.48]You're in a doctor's office now, and he's got some bad fucking news.
[15:37.68]He's got a little pamphlet, and he hands it to me, and it's like, you have a disease in your kidneys.
[15:43.52]And now my eyes are gonna rip open, and I'm gonna be like... It's not gonna be good.
[16:01.08]I probably just, like, pinched a nerve.
[16:02.22]I have morning sickness.
[16:16.43]I don't think it's possible for me to be pregnant.
[16:24.35]Hey.
[16:24.59]Pastel Cube.
[16:31.36]Thanks a lot.
[16:31.78]Welcome.
[16:33.06]Thank you.
[16:37.88]Welcome to the solar system.
[16:40.04]Not with that attitude.
[16:40.92]I'll be fine.
[16:43.68]That's what I said.
[16:45.28]All I have to do is anytime I think of something sad or awful, just think of the first Muppet movie.
[16:51.75]Think of like Muppets Take Manhattan.
[16:55.85]And everything will be fine.
[16:59.31]Okay.
[17:02.52]Okay, honey.
[17:03.56]We need... Okay, coal.
[17:04.44]That's what I wanted.
[17:05.06]Coal.
[17:06.28]Tomorrow is the coal day.
[17:10.98]We're going straight for the mine.
[17:13.55]But I do want to go to the store.
[17:15.23]Because I just want to straight up sell these corns.
[17:18.97]Actually, wait a minute.
[17:22.43]Can I do anything in here?
[17:36.36]Fall.
[17:36.70]There we go.
[17:38.85]I think I actually have all these.
[17:39.93]I'm going to go get these.
[17:41.36]Hazelnut, wild plum, and a common mushroom.
[17:43.56]Where am I going to get that?
[17:46.16]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[17:51.74]KillKing73, thanks for three months.
[17:53.48]I keep forgetting I did that when Orson Welles screams at me.
[17:57.76]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[18:02.92]Is it Antoyo or Antojopi?
[18:06.32]Antoyopi?
[18:08.51]Thanks for subbing.
[18:10.37]Thank you.
[18:14.51]I know I picked up these two things.
[18:18.65]I guess I could go do some foraging.
[18:22.58]No, no, no, no.
[18:23.72]Stay on task.
[18:25.46]On task.
[18:28.04]My biggest problem with this game is I just aimlessly do things.
[18:31.68]When I get a thought, I do it.
[18:33.00]And I need to stop doing that because then you end up with 70 grapes.
[18:37.32]So we need to be focused.
[18:39.42]Focus!
[18:43.88]Uh, yeah, I'll take that because I'm going to be killing slimes anyways.
[18:50.73]No, don't throw it in the trash.
[18:51.97]I'm trying to open this door, but sometimes it just doesn't work.
[18:55.55]Where is he?
[18:58.27]What?
[19:03.65]Open up the register.
[19:06.09]Can I just rifle through this guy's shit and take what I want?
[19:09.79]Ooh!
[19:22.04]I don't know if there was gonna be another chance to do that.
[19:24.94]And I kind of need it.
[19:27.28]Was that a bad idea?
[19:31.04]Didn't I just talk about impulse?
[19:33.50]Was that an impulse decision?
[19:34.58]Should I not have done that?
[19:40.84]Oh, well, I got the big bag now.
[19:54.95]Alright, now it's actually back to bedtime.
[19:58.38]But I need to go to my crab pots.
[20:00.98]That is very important.
[20:03.52]Where are they again?
[20:04.02]There's one next to the sewer.
[20:07.30]Another, uh, crayfish.
[20:11.66]Whatever.
[20:13.36]And the one in the ocean.
[20:19.18]Is this 1.04 or the 1.05?
[20:21.03]It's whatever version is updated automatically on Steam.
[20:24.71]I'm not in a beta, I don't think.
[20:26.19]I'm just... I just play the game.
[20:28.15]I just double click it on Steam.
[20:37.70]A clam?
[20:39.95]Can you open these?
[20:40.81]Can I pry these open to see if there's a pearl or something in here?
[20:45.81]Don't forget to bait.
[20:48.19]Thank you very much.
[20:53.61]It was a mistake.
[20:55.23]I should not have bought the bag.
[20:57.58]Because I wanted to do chicken coop.
[21:03.96]Otto?
[21:05.72]Hey, what are you doing?
[21:08.92]Are you being a good dog?
[21:16.40]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[21:20.93]Purple pancakes with two Zs.
[21:25.51]Welcome to the family.
[21:26.17]Thanks for subbing.
[21:30.96]Enjoy your earth, your moon, your stars, your sky, your Venus, your Jupiter.
[21:37.24]Those are coming.
[21:38.74]Jupiter is on the way.
[21:40.88]Soon.
[21:44.32]Is Stardew Valley worth buying?
[21:45.64]Absolutely.
[21:48.44]The only reason why I would say not to buy this game is if you hate the idea of picking plants up and tending to crops.
[21:56.88]If tending to crops is not something that excites you,
[22:01.85]I would say don't do it.
[22:04.13]But I am having a blast in this game.
[22:06.91]It's just super fun just to kind of walk around and do shit and pick up weeds and slash stuff with an axe.
[22:14.49]Plant grapes.
[22:15.17]I don't know.
[22:15.45]It's fun.
[22:16.01]I highly, highly, highly recommend it.
[22:18.39]Especially because it's so cheap.
[22:22.87]What do I want to sell?
[22:25.40]Alright.
[22:26.02]It's a game time decision, guys.
[22:27.32]Should I sell 93 blackberries?
[22:30.46]Or 94?
[22:31.20]And keep the two of these ones for the, uh... The nine items that I can show off?
[22:37.35]I don't know what to do.
[22:38.37]I feel like I might... Could I use these somewhere else?
[22:41.57]Do they show any other purpose?
[22:48.51]In, like, winter time, are these, like, a commodity?
[22:50.73]Oh, you shouldn't have sold those blackberries!
[22:58.55]I think I'm just gonna do it.
[23:02.84]Because that could be a lot of money that I could get.
[23:05.04]Oh, here's a hazelnut.
[23:10.58]We're selling them.
[23:15.32]Say goodbye.
[23:16.30]Let's see what 93 berries gives us.
[23:22.04]And a periwinkle.
[23:23.23]And a cockle.
[23:26.31]And a clam.
[23:27.75]And a shrimp.
[23:29.33]And some seeds.
[23:30.33]And a crayfish.
[23:31.25]And a clam.
[23:32.47]And some coral.
[23:33.89]And eight corns.
[23:38.88]And some fiber.
[23:45.08]Is that Saturn's sleep?
[23:46.88]I'm assuming the ZZZ in that particular way is sleep.
[23:50.58]So Saturn's ZZZ.
[23:51.78]Saturn's sleep.
[23:54.43]Thanks a lot.
[23:54.79]Welcome.
[23:58.82]Ooh, 2,500.
[23:59.04]2,000 gold.
[23:59.26]And dumpy seeds, whatever.
[24:27.86]I can still do this.
[24:29.38]I need more coal.
[24:30.60]Coal!
[24:30.86]Remember, coal was the name of the game.
[24:35.80]Not yet.
[24:36.38]Not yet.
[24:36.78]Any corn I can pick up?
[24:37.81]Yeah.
[24:38.43]Lots of corn today.
[24:41.25]Lots of corn today!
[24:42.43]I wish I could get a gold one.
[24:49.37]Give me a gold one.
[24:50.03]I need to show off for the festival.
[24:57.79]Come on!
[25:02.74]Ah, you dingus.
[25:12.60]Well... I gotta look at the calendar.
[25:14.52]We're going... Okay, here's the game plan.
[25:17.11]Water.
[25:18.75]Spa.
[25:21.03]Crab pots.
[25:22.59]Calendar.
[25:24.55]Do not let me go off course.
[25:27.19]Water, spa, crab pots, calendar.
[25:32.83]Don't let me buy $10,000 Prada bags.
[25:45.57]I kind of wish these were one more down so I could get all three.
[25:49.07]I'm gonna sneeze.
[25:50.61]I'm gonna sneeze.
[26:02.23]Jerma's kidney failure just prevented me from sneezing.
[26:04.94]Kind of.
[26:05.40]It stopped hap- No.
[26:06.48]It was before that.
[26:07.54]It stopped.
[26:07.88]It was one of those sneezes that it just doesn't happen.
[26:11.76]Jerma's kidney failure.
[26:14.24]Thanks for your morbid subscription.
[26:17.72]I appreciate it.
[26:19.58]Welcome.
[26:19.84]Am I gonna have to make like a Jerma kidney emote that has like a sad face?
[26:25.50]No, stop putting that in my head.
[26:27.82]That's not what the problem is.
[26:28.86]I'm like fucking 75 years old, so I have a bad back.
[26:37.54]Yeah, I need sprinklers.
[26:38.44]There's a lot of things I need.
[26:40.78]But at this point, like I said, these are all fall.
[26:45.94]I'm going to get my shit together for the wintertime.
[26:47.87]Okay?
[26:49.91]Even though I can't pre-plan anything, because I don't know what you actually make in the wintertime.
[26:54.57]But we're going to have bees.
[26:55.49]No, we're not, because bees won't be around.
[26:56.71]We're going to have crabs.
[27:01.38]This whole thing is getting a redesign in the winter.
[27:11.60]Almost... Pretty much 60% done.
[27:13.44]Okie dokie.
[27:23.80]Uh-huh.
[27:30.48]Is there any good movies?
[27:33.24]This is gonna take a while.
[27:38.64]See, I can't... Somebody just said farming simulator.
[27:42.31]I actually bought farming simulator, the new one.
[27:44.83]And I tried to play it.
[27:46.61]And I physically could not get through the tutorial.
[27:50.28]I could not get my machine to go down to ride over the grass to make it tilled.
[27:56.52]I didn't understand how to do it.
[27:57.54]I couldn't do it.
[27:59.51]I spent about 22 minutes in the game total and I just stopped playing.
[28:04.03]But I was always interested in the idea.
[28:06.09]Something about tending crops and selling stuff.
[28:10.20]This game just happened to make it so easy to get into.
[28:20.49]Do I have enough water?
[28:21.19]Yeah, I do.
[28:25.09]Farmville 2.0.
[28:27.31]See, I never played those games either, but aren't those games based around paying money?
[28:32.45]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[28:35.84]Moda 1209.
[28:40.08]Welcome.
[28:42.88]Thanks for the sub.
[28:44.48]Very much appreciated.
[28:45.54]Much love.
[28:48.39]But yeah, isn't Farmville, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Farmville about, hey, here are a bunch of timers.
[28:56.08]Do you want to see the timer go to zero?
[28:59.34]Please pay us 48 cents.
[29:03.32]You just watch timers.
[29:05.34]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[29:11.12]Hung for Choi.
[29:13.42]Mr. Fat, Fat Man, whatever your name is.
[29:15.66]Hung Fat Choi.
[29:17.38]I guess that's your name.
[29:19.83]Welcome.
[29:20.23]Thank you.
[29:21.25]Much appreciated.
[29:21.83]I'm gonna call you Mr. Frachoy.
[29:27.80]That's literally it.
[29:29.48]That's why, like, a lot of mobile games, it's so annoying because I play, obviously, I play a lot of iPad games.
[29:34.78]You guys, a lot of you guys already know that I'm an iPad gamer.
[29:38.99]A lot of iPad games fall into the same category as that.
[29:42.53]Oh, wait, spa, spa, stay on task.
[29:48.86]More than half of games that come out on the iOS store are just timer money grabbers.
[29:57.42]Or they're little match-three games that also cost money for bonuses.
[30:08.47]And it's too bad, because mobile actually is a pretty great platform.
[30:11.73]There's so many interesting potential things you can do, and a lot of people have done really interesting things on mobile.
[30:18.98]Not even really pay to win, more like pay to even enjoy the experience that they decided to make.
[30:29.07]Not even pay to win, pay to like actually play the game.
[30:32.57]And not like hate it.
[30:36.61]I gained a star.
[30:37.89]Oh no, I gained a heart.
[30:40.13]Do I have any, uh... Ooh, I can give it some honey.
[30:45.61]Should I give him some honey?
[30:47.49]This is a rarity.
[30:49.33]You know what I mean?
[30:49.97]This is a rare treat, dude.
[30:51.65]This is the only harvest I've gotten.
[30:57.48]I've already given him two gifts.
[30:58.92]I can't even give it to him.
[31:08.88]German goes to the spa every day and wears a $10,000 bag.
[31:10.60]Yeah, that kind of is like
[31:16.14]That is the life, I guess.
[31:24.47]Yeah, and like you talked, somebody said Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[31:27.91]They make, they churn money.
[31:29.93]They just churn money.
[31:31.91]You go to the top in-game grossing apps on the App Store and it's just these money churning, people just dumping buckets of money like there's a hole in their boat and they're in a money lake.
[31:46.68]It's crazy.
[31:49.80]Doesn't Clash of Clans... I don't remember the exact statistic.
[31:54.11]But wasn't there a point where Clash of Clans was making... I don't want to be incorrect, but it was something ridiculous.
[32:00.21]It was like $500,000 a day that game was making.
[32:04.17]Or something even more ridiculous.
[32:07.20]It was something outrageous that that game was producing in revenue a day.
[32:21.11]My favorite iOS game is the Room series.
[32:23.97]The Room, the Room 2, and the Room 3.
[32:27.36]Or Sorcery.
[32:28.76]If you have some time.
[32:30.08]That's kind of a game book.
[32:35.48]Alright, we're going to... Straight down.
[32:45.21]Flappy Bird.
[32:46.13]Flappy Bird was kind of...
[32:49.34]Flappy Bird was just free, and it sort of, like, turned into a meme.
[32:53.94]Right?
[32:56.10]I don't think that guy that made Flappy Bird ever intended to get, like, this giant cash grab.
[33:02.69]Didn't he just, like, make the game?
[33:04.11]It was just, like, a little thing I did.
[33:06.59]And it just exploded.
[33:07.39]It turned into, like, a meme.
[33:11.33]Meme.
[33:11.55]Meme.
[33:14.63]Oh, whoops, I forgot to bring this guy.
[33:15.83]I have a craving for a blackberry.
[33:17.03]I wish you would have said that, like, two days ago.
[33:19.37]It's almost like he knew.
[33:20.90]He's just trying to... One of these times, I'm going to actually do that.
[33:26.30]Okay, I want to look at your stuff.
[33:38.77]Get over there!
[33:42.27]There is a customer in your store.
[33:44.24]Get over there.
[33:44.92]Are you serious?
[33:50.36]What could you possibly... What is it?
[33:53.82]Don't get any ideas.
[33:57.03]You are a monumental douche.
[33:59.83]Because I want to buy something from you and you do... Oh, don't steal anything.
[34:05.43]What an asshole.
[34:12.61]Salmon in the river this time of year.
[34:13.89]Really?
[34:14.43]I love salmon.
[34:15.09]We're going to get salmon.
[34:17.13]Salmon time.
[34:20.12]No, no, no, no.
[34:24.90]No.
[34:28.22]Calendar.
[34:29.90]Abigail's birthday.
[34:33.32]Happy birthday.
[34:37.26]Yeah, you're welcome.
[34:37.88]I remembered.
[34:44.52]Where is it?
[34:46.16]Stardew Valley Ferry.
[34:47.00]It is in three days.
[34:48.54]One, two, three.
[35:00.47]Okay, there is another fish head.
[35:05.81]Bait it.
[35:06.91]Don't forget to bait it.
[35:15.76]Who am I gonna marry?
[35:17.76]Nobody at the moment.
[35:19.78]Nobody cares.
[35:20.64]Okay, whoever said this was a bad idea, you get extra points.
[35:36.93]I put these two crab pots down.
[35:39.17]It's been probably like a week.
[35:41.51]And I've gotten just trash.
[35:44.41]Just absolute garbage.
[35:46.05]Where are the crabs?
[35:48.85]There should be crabs growing.
[35:49.85]I thought it was going to be Crab City.
[35:51.61]Nope.
[35:53.05]Periwinkles and half-eaten clams.
[35:57.93]Those things suck.
[35:58.67]Do I have enough time to get cold?
[36:06.55]No, I don't.
[36:10.31]You guys know what time it is.
[36:12.44]Back to bed.
[36:16.02]No, it's time to fish for some salmon.
[36:17.70]This is the river, right?
[36:18.66]This is classified as a river.
[36:20.48]I want to get some salmon.
[36:23.31]I love salmon.
[36:24.25]In real life.
[36:25.73]Therefore, my character has to eat it too.
[36:27.27]Trash.
[36:46.41]Oh, there's a chest up there.
[36:50.77]Get it!
[36:51.03]A little too much zing on that one.
[36:59.54]Only 10% chance to get a crab from a crab pot.
[37:03.35]That seems terrible.
[37:06.25]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[37:10.61]The Slam Burger?
[37:13.05]What is that from?
[37:14.23]The Slam Burger.
[37:15.29]Isn't that from some cartoon or from a movie or a TV show?
[37:19.87]Well, anyways, thanks for something.
[37:20.97]Welcome.
[37:21.81]Thank you, Slam Burger.
[37:28.07]Ancient seed.
[37:30.11]Well, can I plant it?
[37:34.69]Should I plant the ancient seed?
[37:39.75]What is it gonna give me?
[37:40.49]All right, we're gonna plant it, I think.
[37:53.12]Does it grow in the fall?
[38:03.47]I'm scared.
[38:04.01]I don't know.
[38:04.29]I feel like this is a rare item.
[38:09.99]It's ancient.
[38:10.55]Be gentle.
[38:11.07]I'm going to try a different part of the river.
[38:14.25]I want a salmon.
[38:16.79]This is kind of more classified as a stream.
[38:18.41]Alright, I'm seeing people screaming in the chat to donate it.
[38:34.05]I'm seeing, like, DONATE IT!
[38:36.67]DONATE IT!
[38:41.61]Oh, you fool!
[38:52.57]Yeah, this is a stream.
[38:53.77]This is not... Not a river.
[39:01.46]Although, isn't a stream just a baby river?
[39:05.98]A stream is just a river that hasn't hit puberty yet, right?
[39:08.48]It's like one of those types of deals.
[39:09.78]It'll grow into a river eventually from erosion.
[39:13.10]See, I know medicine.
[39:15.85]Biology.
[39:16.77]Medicine's the wrong word.
[39:18.43]Chub.
[39:38.79]Salmon.
[39:46.09]This is a stream that's live.
[39:48.29]Oh, yeah, you got me there.
[39:50.37]You did.
[39:50.81]That was it.
[39:51.43]You got me.
[39:57.59]I just want one salmon.
[39:59.77]Maybe I can only catch them in the morning or something.
[40:03.95]Maybe I should go upstream.
[40:17.41]Okay, somebody just put a wall of text.
[40:22.63]I don't even know what the hell that person's saying.
[40:28.98]That person just, like, copy and pasted, like, nine things in the chat.
[40:34.49]That was, like, that was crazy.
[40:45.38]Overwatch tonight?
[40:46.04]Yes.
[40:47.64]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[40:52.34]Ordu?
[40:54.32]Much appreciated.
[40:54.96]Welcome.
[40:55.24]Thanks for stopping by, Ordu.
[40:58.30]Welcome to the jock-shockers.
[41:03.20]You just purchased your official ticket to be qualified as a certified shock-jocking jock-shocker.
[41:20.74]No, not Overwatch.
[41:23.08]Why not?
[41:23.82]Not right now.
[41:26.05]I'm playing Duck Game right now.
[41:35.51]After 7pm, you can't catch them.
[41:37.07]After 7pm, you can't catch them.
[41:38.65]After 7pm.
[41:39.21]I got it.
[41:45.53]You know, I'm thinking about it, right?
[41:47.55]It's actually kind of funny.
[41:48.89]It must be so frustrating watching a stream like this and watching a dude saying over and over again, I'm trying to catch a salmon, and you know in your heart of hearts that what this person is doing is not gonna happen.
[42:05.38]And you're just like, oh my god, please, you fucking idiot.
[42:08.87]You're sitting here catching chubs.
[42:11.17]You're reeling in chubs for no reason.
[42:13.21]Can't you see?
[42:14.75]So I understand.
[42:23.15]Okay, time for bed.
[42:24.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[42:26.08]Excuse me.
[42:29.60]Back to bed.
[42:42.12]I got so caught up talking.
[42:43.46]I got so caught up talking that I wasn't paused.
[42:45.38]I was just talking and I wasn't paused.
[42:52.50]I was just stalking and I wasn't paused.
[43:08.13]Which one of you dingleberries took my wallet this time? 8,000?
[43:17.76]I'm okay.
[43:19.48]I'm fine.
[43:21.22]Maybe somebody found me.
[43:22.91]Greg, how are you doing?
[43:23.75]I've enclosed some instructions on how to make one of my favorite fish recipes.
[43:27.83]Sashimi.
[43:28.37]He likes sushi.
[43:29.09]Okay.
[43:32.57]Last night, there was a team member who found you.
[43:35.13]Yeah, yeah.
[43:36.39]800 gold.
[43:37.49]At least I didn't get it stolen.
[43:38.95]I got some honey, though.
[43:47.64]Damn it.
[43:48.04]Let's hope one of those is gonna be rare.
[43:54.80]So did he give me the recipe?
[43:57.82]Or do I just know it now?
[44:02.18]I guess I just know it.
[44:03.27]Oh, thanks, Linus.
[44:11.33]Really appreciate it, dude.
[44:13.29]Thanks for the recipe.
[44:21.16]We have some cranberries.
[44:22.40]I'm getting antsy just thinking about them.
[44:29.69]Is the dog still?
[44:38.01]Of course the dog is still alive.
[44:39.17]You just heard him barking?
[44:40.31]He's right up there, top left.
[44:54.61]Almost time for, what was it?
[44:56.53]Like 12,000 gold?
[44:57.35]That is so awesome.
[45:01.75]I'm so glad I have these.
[45:05.29]Remember, if you buy this game, cranberries.
[45:09.74]Cranberries are the savior of your entire save file.
[45:16.08]Best plant in the world.
[45:16.96]You know what?
[45:18.14]To commemorate these cranberries tomorrow, I'm going to get some cranberry juice from the supermarket.
[45:24.91]Cranberry juice cocktail because I can't really- I can't really handle 100% cranberry juice.
[45:29.27]It's too tart.
[45:39.47]Okie dokie.
[45:46.64]We need to refill the watering can.
[45:57.15]Can, can, can.
[45:58.84]Are cranberries even good?
[45:59.58]Oh my god, they're amazing.
[46:01.86]This batch right here, this little harvest over here, was, what, 13,000 last time?
[46:09.26]Kind of ridiculous.
[46:29.94]I'm not gonna lie, I'm getting sick of the corn.
[46:31.34]I'm getting sick of looking at it.
[46:38.09]Where's the... Where's my natural disasters drop-down menu?
[46:44.07]So I can just have a tornado come over here, like Sim Earth.
[46:50.34]Wouldn't that be a show?
[47:07.22]Okay.
[47:12.06]That planning pattern.
[47:15.30]Okay, give me a little bit of credit.
[47:17.72]Don't give me credit at all, but listen.
[47:18.94]Hear me out.
[47:20.74]I did this, I don't know, I thought this was like... I didn't have very much time in the game.
[47:24.54]I mean, that doesn't really explain this, but...
[47:32.75]Okay.
[47:34.12]I tried to explain myself.
[47:35.58]But then I realized how bad this looks.
[47:39.22]So I just froze and stared into the camera.
[47:46.82]Alright, what am I doing?
[47:49.65]Two days.
[47:50.13]You know, I'm not going to sell all these.
[47:53.87]Get some money for these chubs.
[47:55.39]Especially the gold ones.
[47:57.75]Actually, you know what?
[48:03.56]Keep one, just in case I can give that to the... Missed a watering spot.
[48:16.15]Where?
[48:16.33]Are you serious?
[48:25.21]I'm going to have to check that out.
[48:26.41]I'm trying to... Where is it?
[48:32.15]What did I miss?
[48:34.25]What did I miss?
[48:34.73]Alright, let me take a look at what this even takes.
[48:51.20]Quality sprinkler.
[48:52.10]One gold bar.
[48:52.90]Should I just go mine and try to just get a bunch of gold and quartz?
[48:55.84]And just make sprinklers?
[48:59.29]Yeah, I'm putting elbow grease into it.
[49:00.59]I'm doing it the traditional way.
[49:03.38]See, all these billionaires and bigwigs, they want to put sprinklers down.
[49:07.54]I want to do the work the hard way.
[49:10.16]Like my great-grandfather used to do.
[49:15.54]Now, he died when he was 42 from exhaustion, but at least he did it.
[49:22.42]He put his mind to it.
[49:34.64]Let's just see.
[49:35.42]I'm curious.
[49:36.44]Let's see what one of the normal sprinklers does.
[49:49.99]Let's make a normal sprinkler.
[49:58.99]Your grandfather invented sprinklers.
[50:02.26]He probably did.
[50:11.12]Let's make a sprinkler.
[50:12.64]Here we go.
[50:13.38]You ready for the first sprinkler?
[50:14.80]Wait, what's this?
[50:15.30]Tapper?
[50:20.53]Alright, I got a sprinkler.
[50:22.45]Two sprinklers.
[50:23.33]Three sprinklers.
[50:24.29]Four regular sprinklers.
[50:26.73]How do I put them down?
[50:27.51]Where do they go?
[50:29.95]I don't understand.
[50:31.53]It's four tiles?
[50:34.62]So they should go over here.
[50:36.64]Right?
[50:37.20]That's one, two, three, four.
[50:39.30]Or is it four around?
[50:40.42]Is it four adjacent tiles?
[50:44.05]So that means like adjacent tiles as in it'd be like one, two, three, four, right?
[50:47.83]So that means one would go right here.
[50:57.26]So that's one, two, three, four.
[51:04.70]I don't know how these work.
[51:08.10]It waters in a plus.
[51:09.10]Okay.
[51:11.64]Well, then let's get the maximum amount we can do here.
[51:13.74]So, that's... One, two... From inside the bushes.
[51:18.70]I guess I can get, like, these.
[51:26.62]Yeah, this is... My farm just, like... I can't even have sprinklers because, like, this is... I did this as a joke.
[51:32.38]And, like, it's ruined by sprinklers.
[51:34.59]Well, look.
[51:34.89]At least we have... I can get these, like, four.
[51:41.38]Yeah, see?
[51:41.88]We'll just get this upper corner.
[51:49.19]Yeah, we're good.
[51:50.89]See?
[51:51.73]This will be watered.
[51:54.89]I know I shouldn't have done that.
[51:59.72]I can go here, there.
[52:01.24]Yeah, I'll do that.
[52:17.22]Don't accidentally hit one of your go to bushes.
[52:20.30]So I'll do that.
[52:34.07]Well, it is what it is.
[52:35.67]I didn't even know sprinklers were in this game when I made these stupid patterns.
[52:42.50]NA sprinkler system.
[52:45.94]Hey, don't make fun of my sprinkler system.
[52:49.74]It might not be top-notch.
[52:51.78]But look, I'm doing the watering can.
[52:54.64]I'm going to get the steel watering can and just smoke through this.
[52:59.28]I'm doing it the old-fashioned way.
[53:07.23]Alright, what was more important than this?
[53:10.24]And like I said, this is all gone in this next season anyways.
[53:13.34]I'm getting this whole thing is gone.
[53:17.32]And we're going to turn into the bee colony.
[53:23.16]All right.
[53:24.40]Back to bed now.
[53:26.14]Back to... Back to the spa.
[53:28.50]Actually, wait.
[53:36.15]We're going to see if there's any fruits in here.
[53:38.85]Nope.
[53:49.09]Water spa?
[53:49.89]Crab pots?
[53:53.98]You can put a crab pot in the spa?
[54:00.52]Bees don't work in the... I know bees don't work in the... We don't want animals.
[54:06.10]You know what?
[54:07.95]I'm sick of this.
[54:08.47]I'm sick of this vegetable thing.
[54:09.91]You know?
[54:11.07]Hasn't worked out so well.
[54:12.87]So we're going to have a bunch of chips.
[54:14.13]We are going to do the mayonnaise machine for the winter time.
[54:17.53]If we can do it.
[54:25.80]Back to bees.
[54:38.92]Oh, some-
[54:54.75]They were telling me what my to-do list was.
[54:58.41]Not to put crab pots into the spa water.
[55:03.37]I seriously thought that's what you guys were trying to tell me.
[55:10.43]Wow.
[55:16.47]That's rich.
[55:20.35]Can I get full energy?
[55:21.61]Good.
[55:28.11]I don't know why I love that.
[55:29.13]That is great.
[55:32.56]Did somebody egg-beat my brain this afternoon?
[55:35.24]Are you serious?
[55:37.04]Uh, where you put, uh... You put the crab parts in the spa water?
[55:43.70]Oh, yeah, I gotcha.
[55:44.70]I'll take care of that one.
[55:47.34]I was about to do it.
[55:50.22]I was... I... I thought he was trying to tell me that I could get $10,000 worth of product if I put that in the spa.
[55:59.59]Like, if you can scroll up, just scroll up and read what, like, those people were saying.
[56:03.89]It was as if they were telling me to do that.
[56:11.82]Sometimes it's hard to pay attention to games and chat.
[56:18.57]Okay.
[56:19.91]Crab pots.
[56:26.60]Let's go to the crab pots.
[56:28.16]And if there's no crabs in them, maybe I should just pick them up and put them into the goddamn dumpster.
[56:36.37]Yeah, I gotta get back into the mine.
[56:37.94]There's so many things I need to do.
[56:48.92]Yeah, yeah.
[56:50.34]If I put a crab pot in the... Oh, good.
[56:52.90]A broken CD.
[56:54.15]Excellent.
[56:55.57]Good.
[56:56.05]Pick it up.
[56:56.91]Fuck these things.
[57:00.91]The only thing I would get by putting a crab pot into the spa is a wet band-aid.
[57:11.38]Selling these things back to Henry, whatever the hell his name is.
[57:19.84]I baited this one, didn't I?
[57:21.86]Who cares?
[57:22.28]I'm done with this.
[57:25.50]Throwing these things in the trash.
[57:37.56]These things were $2,000 a pop.
[57:40.22]Right?
[57:41.07]And I believe I've gotten a total of maybe 40 gold from them in two or three weeks.
[57:51.57]Back to bed.
[57:56.44]Change the title of your stream.
[57:57.68]Yeah.
[57:58.80]We're not doing crap.
[57:59.84]I wanted to have a line of them.
[58:02.95]But that doesn't... I just have a bunch of broken CDs, trash, and periwinkles.
[58:21.21]Get out of my way.
[58:31.25]Crops is where the money is.
[58:32.27]Yeah, you're probably right.
[58:32.97]But we'll just dump.
[58:33.52]I don't... Dump them.
[58:34.30]I don't even care.
[58:34.86]Dump them.
[58:35.90]Ooh.
[58:37.76]No.
[58:38.30]I don't care.
[58:38.88]Give me money.
[58:40.48]I almost just put the ancient seed in there.
[58:46.82]Bad time.
[58:52.92]That gets scammed, yeah.
[58:53.78]Crab pot scam.
[58:57.12]Ooh.
[59:00.06]Ooh.
[59:01.32]Ooh.
[59:03.88]3K.
[59:11.60]Back up to where I was before with money.
[59:18.41]We got our first vine.
[59:19.29]I thought those were blackberries.
[59:22.93]I'm going to shit my pants.
[59:27.51]Come on, give me some gold ones.
[59:28.35]Give me some gold ones.
[59:36.05]That bring to the fair.
[59:38.55]Any gold ones yet?
[59:52.68]God, this vineyard.
[59:53.50]I know, get out of my way.
[60:02.46]And we got another... I'm gonna make so much money.
[60:04.37]I'll probably have 30,000, 40,000 at the end of this when it's all said and done.
[60:11.67]Getting extras too.
[60:13.07]All of these extras.
[60:15.51]Look at those two extras.
[60:28.58]This is the second harvest.
[60:29.92]Holy shit.
[60:33.82]Sick 57.
[60:35.83]I didn't get that many last time, did I?
[60:43.09]Oh my word.
[60:45.11]Does this even do anything?
[60:46.01]This didn't even do anything.
[60:47.18]Hold on just a second.
[60:54.40]Did it do anything?
[60:57.42]I can't even tell if this is watered or not.
[61:03.74]I guess.
[61:04.18]I don't know.
[61:11.27]Yeah, it is.
[61:14.95]Let me check my mail.
[61:18.32]See what idiot wants to talk to me.
[61:20.10]I just want to remind you that the Stardew Valley Fair is happening tomorrow.
[61:23.18]Bring your nine items for the Grange display.
[61:26.38]Remember, the fair starts at 9am.
[61:29.55]Okay.
[61:31.47]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and honey.
[61:37.11]Or, yeah, honey.
[61:39.59]I'm going' gonna show them what I got.
[61:41.37]You know what I mean?
[61:42.11]I'm' gonna show them the real deal.
[61:44.96]First of all,
[61:47.08]Uh, boink, boink.
[61:50.58]I will take a huge payday from this.
[61:53.90]Absolutely just a massive payday.
[62:03.26]I'm gonna get a good night's sleep.
[62:04.28]What the hell was that?
[62:12.26]You guys heard that, right?
[62:13.08]What was that?
[62:15.06]Are you spying on me?
[62:17.69]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[62:22.75]Mayonnaise stream just subscribed.
[62:24.48]Oh, now I have to do mayonnaise.
[62:27.92]You don't make your name mayonnaise stream and then subscribe if you are not expecting a mayonnaise stream.
[62:36.58]But thank you, whoever you are.
[62:38.38]Appreciate it.
[62:50.63]Those sprinklers were such a waste.
[62:54.37]It's okay though.
[62:55.09]I'm going to really show everybody how cool I am at the fair tomorrow.
[63:01.40]All gold star items and a wild jar of honey.
[63:04.70]I better get the blue ribbon.
[63:11.81]I better at least get a silver medal.
[63:16.33]You don't show up with that type of quality product and not get rewarded for it.
[63:19.67]You
[63:25.69]That's what I'm talking about.
[63:36.56]Wrong way.
[63:40.22]I want the steel watering can.
[63:41.90]That's my only saving grace at the moment.
[63:50.32]What is it, dog?
[63:52.54]What do you want, dog?
[63:54.93]Quiet, dog!
[64:01.07]Get the blue ribbon from my fire wash nudes.
[64:06.38]Well, I will take the... I'll take the blue ribbon.
[64:10.02]Whatever ribbon you're giving, I guess.
[64:12.54]For whatever contest I was entered in.
[64:25.89]What can you do with, like, 30 grand?
[64:29.37]I guess I could just... Winter savings, right?
[64:33.47]Just don't spend it and just do a ton of cool shit in the winter.
[64:37.79]We can rethink our whole plot.
[64:39.17]Did I already do this?
[64:40.93]I did this already, didn't I?
[64:41.73]I don't know.
[64:44.91]I'm gonna do it again for good measure.
[64:48.81]I didn't do this side.
[64:50.69]Don't run out of water.
[64:51.41]Come on.
[64:52.21]Almost done.
[64:55.05]Don't run out of water.
[64:58.07]Don't run out of water.
[65:12.96]Okay, let's go.
[65:14.02]Spa time.
[65:14.96]Let's go relax, get our heads on straight, and prepare for what tomorrow brings.
[65:25.50]First, we're gonna do some slashing.
[65:26.40]Yeah, let's go.
[65:30.37]Oh, you fucker.
[65:35.59]Two farm buildings?
[65:36.93]Well, then maybe I can jumpstart my career.
[65:41.81]Maybe I can jumpstart my career as... the guy from Curious George.
[65:47.89]That's who I look like.
[65:48.75]That weird dude in the yellow suit.
[66:03.85]There he is.
[66:05.99]I've explored deep into the caves.
[66:07.97]That's cool.
[66:10.37]I held some secrets.
[66:12.51]Still 3 out of 10, but just be cautious when you go there.
[66:14.97]I know.
[66:15.85]Oh, please.
[66:18.07]Train!
[66:21.89]How do I get it to stop?
[66:25.65]How do I get the train to stop?
[66:26.39]Hold on.
[66:28.38]There's got to be something I can do.
[66:29.40]Can I throw something down?
[66:32.02]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[66:35.67]No, don't eat the hazelnut.
[66:40.11]Stop!
[66:41.93]Wait!
[66:45.31]Can I go in the door?
[66:47.91]Oh!
[66:52.99]Come on.
[66:54.13]What can I do with you?
[67:01.40]Wait, I just got coal.
[67:03.85]Somebody just threw a coal at me.
[67:05.39]Oh, free coal.
[67:07.05]Oh my god, I'm living the high life, guys.
[67:09.91]Free.
[67:10.78]Free, like, dirt coal that drops on the ground.
[67:12.94]Free sandwich crumbs.
[67:18.56]This is awesome.
[67:19.54]And I needed coal, too.
[67:22.52]I don't want any of that.
[67:23.32]Or do I?
[67:24.54]Give me some poison.
[67:26.94]Drop some poison.
[67:28.99]Come on, give me the poison.
[67:31.03]Give me the poison.
[67:31.57]I got plenty of people in this town that deserve it.
[67:36.58]Oh, that was fun.
[67:37.56]That was real fun.
[67:42.56]Bye, train.
[67:43.43]That was a fun time.
[67:44.93]How much coal did I get?
[67:46.91]Not that much.
[67:47.35]Yeah, I took a little damage.
[68:02.00]It's okay.
[68:02.40]We're gonna go shake it off in the spa.
[68:09.04]High energy stream.
[68:11.24]Only sometimes.
[68:14.11]When I get a little too excited.
[68:17.01]It happens from time to time, I will admit.
[68:18.81]And I'm just pushing the microphone away from myself.
[68:21.07]Gosh darn it.
[68:21.87]You heal too in here.
[68:22.73]Nice.
[68:38.39]Come on.
[68:41.15]Come on.
[68:52.44]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[68:57.40]Level two humanoid.
[68:59.47]Thank you so much for subscribing.
[69:01.37]Well, level two, you're going to have to tell us in the chat, what are you putting your first skill point in?
[69:09.67]Just got to level 2.
[69:10.33]What do you get?
[69:11.15]Strength?
[69:11.57]Stamina?
[69:12.39]Agility?
[69:13.24]Dexterity?
[69:13.88]Constitution?
[69:14.70]What's it gonna go into?
[69:19.58]I need to know this.
[69:20.84]I have to know.
[69:22.22]I will stand still until I know.
[69:27.54]Until I get an answer.
[69:54.29]Stamina.
[69:55.21]Okay.
[69:57.01]Yeah, I was thinking... Maybe a little bit of intelligence, maybe.
[70:02.79]Because, you know, I've seen you cast fireballs.
[70:08.49]Stamina's not a great stat if you're going to be casting fire.
[70:12.51]But, you know, HP is a good thing, too.
[70:14.09]You've got to have a bigger HP pool.
[70:20.61]What am I doing?
[70:25.82]I'm fishing, that's what I'm doing.
[70:38.59]Hit.
[70:47.71]Dammit.
[70:49.35]It's after 7pm.
[70:50.51]Did I cast that reel at 7pm?
[70:55.82]Am I hyped up for Dark Souls 3?
[70:57.44]Oh, you better believe it.
[70:59.47]I cannot wait to play that game.
[71:08.89]Okay, rest up.
[71:10.43]We got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[71:11.41]I could give them a chub.
[71:12.95]Golden chub.
[71:20.89]Let's play it by ear.
[71:21.61]I have a lot of good stuff in my inventory, so... Put some honey up there.
[71:27.91]What's the next planet in the solar system?
[71:29.25]It's gonna be Jupiter.
[71:30.65]Actually, hold on.
[71:31.39]Let's do this correctly.
[71:33.53]What is closer to... What's closer to Earth?
[71:38.50]Mars?
[71:41.08]It goes Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, uh...
[71:50.11]Mercury, Nevada, and then Pluto.
[72:11.85]These have... No.
[72:14.93]No, they don't.
[72:23.17]Time for bed.
[72:25.68]9 a.m.
[72:26.12]sharp.
[72:28.10]We are prepared for this, guys.
[72:30.22]We spent all year waiting for this shit.
[72:40.76]Level 5 fishing.
[72:43.56]That's cool.
[72:47.42]Oh, look at that!
[72:48.30]Resources for crafting crab pots.
[72:55.07]No!
[72:58.08]Oh, God.
[73:00.00]God!
[73:00.56]God!
[73:00.64]I didn't... I didn't... I didn't mean to click on that.
[73:17.86]And I don't want to... I can't... I don't... No, I'm not resetting.
[73:20.72]It's going to go from the whole entire beginning of the lab.
[73:23.16]We're making crab pots.
[73:25.14]That's a sign.
[73:31.83]Look at that.
[73:32.93]24k.
[73:34.67]At least we can make more crab pots.
[73:37.25]Oh, let's see what it takes now to make a crab pot because now we have to do it.
[73:43.36]A crab pot.
[73:46.02]Okay.
[73:46.12]Okay.
[73:49.61]Okay.
[73:50.92]Fine.
[73:52.02]You win, game.
[73:54.12]You win.
[74:01.37]You win.
[74:07.47]We're back to the crab pot stream.
[74:10.73]Except we're doing, like, 30 of them.
[74:21.02]I'm taking that as a sign from God.
[74:23.23]God himself.
[74:27.69]I'm gonna get good bait.
[74:30.09]And we're gonna catch an absolute dump load of crabs.
[74:38.24]Why do I sleep next to my furnaces?
[74:39.68]Because I don't want to pay for heat.
[74:41.98]That's why.
[74:47.25]And two.
[74:49.43]Can make two.
[74:50.84]I can make the amount that I just got rid of.
[74:56.16]Hey, well, we're back on.
[75:01.73]Technically, my plan didn't change, though, guys, right?
[75:09.75]My plan technically didn't change.
[75:20.79]Get out of the way!
[75:22.43]Stop this madness.
[75:28.54]Any golds?
[75:29.94]No.
[75:30.56]Just sell them.
[75:34.40]I'll water these later.
[75:47.97]Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[75:48.61]I'm going to the festival anyways.
[75:50.36]9 p.m.
[75:50.66]sharp.
[75:51.36]I mean, 9 a.m.
[75:51.98]sharp.
[76:00.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:01.11]We can just chill for a minute.
[76:12.69]When I was in the fall, I had 40 plus all copper, iron, and gold ignits.
[76:16.91]How do you say that word?
[76:17.63]Is it ingot?
[76:18.92]Ignits?
[76:20.48]And had 100 plus coal, and here Germa is struggling to obtain four.
[76:24.60]Well, look.
[76:26.90]I'm not struggling.
[76:29.16]I've made a bunch of poor business decisions.
[76:34.12]Right?
[76:35.20]I have not been struggling.
[76:38.47]I've just made a bunch of poor business decisions.
[76:45.63]During those decisions, I was not struggling.
[76:51.45]Shop?
[76:51.73]What's this?
[76:53.79]Trade in your star tokens for prizes?
[76:55.91]What does that mean?
[77:03.65]Oh, you get these from the fair.
[77:06.07]Minigames.
[77:06.51]I'm gonna destroy these.
[77:10.05]Are you strong like me?
[77:11.18]Smashstone.
[77:11.94]You got it.
[77:18.01]That was easy.
[77:23.27]I get it.
[77:25.03]All sham, no wow.
[77:30.11]Really?
[77:31.87]What's going on, dude?
[77:32.58]Welcome to the stream.
[77:34.70]Thanks for subbing.
[77:38.14]I have to get this perfect.
[77:44.34]Got it.
[77:44.82]Perfect.
[77:45.72]Perfect.
[77:46.48]Absolutely perfect.
[77:49.82]Did he just give me one token?
[77:53.06]How many star tokens do I have?
[77:59.13]Yeah, welcome to the... You're now a certified... What am I calling my subscribers?
[78:05.99]Shit-eaters or something?
[78:06.87]I don't know.
[78:07.31]Something like that.
[78:10.76]But yeah, thanks.
[78:11.22]Welcome, dude.
[78:13.38]Do I do it again?
[78:14.90]How do I get more stars?
[78:21.99]You get one at a time?
[78:24.93]One at a time.
[78:25.71]Oh, they're at the top left, yeah.
[78:28.27]This sucks.
[78:33.78]I don't want to do this.
[78:34.76]I'm gonna... 50 gold.
[78:38.70]Alright, fine.
[78:41.80]Oh, shit.
[78:42.58]I'm gonna use the mouse for this one.
[78:47.58]What is going on?
[78:48.76]I've never shot this thing before.
[78:52.01]It's not good.
[78:52.75]It's not good with the mouse.
[78:54.35]This is odd as hell.
[79:07.03]Fuck.
[79:07.97]I just spit all over my monitor.
[79:09.41]It's like Space Invaders.
[79:25.02]Does that say I have 90% accuracy?
[79:26.70]That is bullshit.
[79:27.58]There's no way I have that much accuracy.
[79:33.54]Did I win?
[79:33.92]50 points.
[79:40.05]That's a B+.
[79:44.73]Why wouldn't you just do this over and over again?
[79:52.76]Let's not... Wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[79:54.34]I'm going to make sure I don't miss anything here.
[79:56.20]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[80:00.88]Lethal Spoon.
[80:01.98]Thanks a lot, man.
[80:03.31]Welcome.
[80:05.41]Welcome.
[80:08.37]You are now a certified... chicken chunker.
[80:13.25]Appreciate it, man.
[80:15.31]What is he doing here?
[80:16.27]The very finest quality products in the whole valley.
[80:18.21]Please inspect my display.
[80:22.79]Sorry, dude.
[80:24.09]You're about to get shit on.
[80:26.95]My display?
[80:27.91]Oh, yeah, look at... Oh, you got some fish over here, Willy.
[80:30.21]Good job.
[80:31.77]I got gold star grapes.
[80:35.27]Yeah.
[80:36.22]That's right.
[80:38.64]That's right.
[80:39.62]Gold stars everywhere.
[80:42.94]Oh, what's this?
[80:44.62]Sick honey?
[80:45.94]And a crab pot?
[80:48.06]Oh, shit.
[80:48.42]That was a joke.
[80:49.52]Okay, good.
[80:51.14]And a goldfish.
[80:53.55]Should I put the ancient seed in there?
[80:54.67]No, that's a dumb idea.
[80:55.57]Look at that.
[80:56.35]Look at how awesome that looks.
[80:59.95]What do you got?
[81:00.37]Cheese?
[81:00.67]Let me see your cheese.
[81:01.60]Can I buy it?
[81:02.00]Does it matter what's in the front?
[81:10.16]I feel like, okay, I want my... I want my best items in the front.
[81:17.55]Hopefully it doesn't matter.
[81:23.13]I'm not gonna put a copper bar in there.
[81:24.61]That'd be stupid.
[81:28.16]Alright, now they got my display.
[81:29.26]Should I talk to them?
[81:32.12]How do I gloat?
[81:32.98]Where's the gloat button?
[81:34.70]The brag... The brag button.
[81:41.47]Selling star tokens for 50 gold?
[81:57.57]That's such a rip-off.
[82:01.39]You're telling me that it's 5,000 gold for 99 star tokens, but I can go make 50 for 50 gold?
[82:11.36]Why would you ever do that?
[82:13.78]What are you, some kind of dummy?
[82:16.98]Step right up, pick a color, and place your bet for a chance to double your wager.
[82:19.72]Uh, green.
[82:25.83]All in.
[82:41.34]Green.
[82:44.02]All in.
[82:52.25]Yeah.
[82:56.51]Green.
[82:59.15]All in.
[83:15.59]Orange.
[83:16.85]All in.
[83:18.69]He thought I was gonna pick Greed.
[83:20.57]See, he's rigging it now.
[83:22.45]And he's like, oh, this asshole's picking all green.
[83:24.27]Watch this.
[83:24.78]Orange.
[83:25.88]Get diarrhea'd on.
[83:29.76]Game's not even good.
[83:33.86]It's the game's fault.
[83:35.26]This guy's game's not even like that fun.
[83:47.34]Yeah, I'm gonna fish.
[83:48.24]Let's fish.
[83:51.14]Go!
[83:52.64]They don't even give me a time to second it.
[83:55.96]Nice trash.
[83:59.96]I got pretty good fishing score, don't I?
[84:01.24]Or fishing proficiency.
[84:11.39]I don't even know what it is.
[84:16.17]Gotta know when to walk away.
[84:20.55]No, you just keep doing it until you lose everything.
[84:35.30]Truth be told, I was gonna do that and I was not gonna stop until I lost.
[84:40.72]So, I could have been... I could have had like 5,000 star tokens, but I still would have done it.
[84:57.62]Can I get 100 points?
[84:58.76]I'm gonna go for like 150.
[84:59.78]I can do it.
[85:08.47]Perfect.
[85:08.85]150, come on.
[85:11.99]Damn it.
[85:22.34]Should I... No, I don't have time.
[85:24.48]I was gonna run down.
[85:27.95]Broken ass CD.
[85:32.09]That counts, because I did it before the... assholes.
[85:34.93]That counted.
[85:36.15]If you do it before, like every game show, if you say your answer before the buzzer goes off, and the buzzer goes off mid-answer, it still counts.
[85:54.08]Come on, baby!
[85:55.67]Come on, all in!
[85:58.36]Big ticket money.
[85:59.32]Big money.
[85:59.82]It's gonna happen.
[86:01.82]I got it.
[86:03.92]Okay, one more time.
[86:05.17]Let's just get back to where I was before.
[86:06.45]One more time.
[86:06.97]Always green.
[86:07.53]It has never not been green.
[86:11.19]Come on.
[86:11.51]Big money.
[86:17.78]Big money.
[86:21.74]Keep going.
[86:23.28]Oh, you...
[86:32.44]Now I'll get it back.
[86:33.76]Watch.
[86:52.63]I can't even move up or down.
[87:00.64]This is a lot of fun.
[87:04.30]I wish this was open year-round.
[87:05.72]I would come and do this all day.
[87:19.09]Shit, I was reading chat.
[87:20.37]I left it.
[87:22.73]Was my square before?
[87:23.47]100-something?
[87:25.53]I can get by that.
[87:26.25]Come on.
[87:34.83]That just vacuumed into my balls.
[87:39.25]I had a suction cup on my crotch and it just sucked it in.
[87:45.25]Shit.
[87:46.71]Crap.
[87:47.16]I mean crap.
[87:51.50]That seriously was green and it didn't go in.
[87:53.30]Are you kidding me right now?
[87:56.02]What is happening?
[88:04.45]This was a bunch of crap, man.
[88:13.78]Alright, 100.
[88:15.34]105.
[88:22.61]Yeah, perfection bonus.
[88:23.93]Okay.
[88:24.87]Okay.
[89:10.90]Look at those balloons!
[89:17.08]How do I... Hello?
[89:19.28]Why can't I talk to the clown?
[89:20.20]I wanna be a clown!
[89:27.25]Wait, can I give him a biscuit?
[89:32.91]Is he a dog?
[89:33.67]Can I give him a biscuit?
[89:41.44]Yeah, she does do really good carpentry work, doesn't she?
[89:43.96]You got anything for sale?
[89:49.67]Let's be real here.
[89:51.85]Do you see the prizes I could buy?
[89:53.53]One of them was a fedora.
[89:55.99]And the other one was a scarecrow.
[89:57.67]I already have five scarecrows.
[90:01.24]It's just unnecessary, guys.
[90:02.28]There's no reason to... I swear to God, every time I hit B, I should be hitting A.
[90:12.65]Ooh, magic crystal man.
[90:17.07]What have you got for me?
[90:18.65]Do you have a way where I can bet money?
[90:22.45]Yeah, do it.
[90:23.31]Read my fortune.
[90:25.13]See you in a room having a conversation with a lady.
[90:27.07]Oh, it's Pam.
[90:31.06]Yeah, we are.
[90:32.20]Now I see you and Abigail in a field of grass.
[90:34.08]You seem happy.
[90:37.20]You're in combat.
[90:37.84]There's something dreadful bearing down on you from the dark, but you seem more ready to face it.
[90:43.48]Did he just predict that Abigail was going to be my wife or something?
[90:50.20]Alright, well, hey.
[90:51.55]Thanks, fortune teller.
[90:52.35]I gave you 100 gold for you to tell me who I have more than two or three stars with.
[90:56.41]Or three hearts.
[90:57.95]Nice work.
[90:58.65]Good private investigating.
[91:01.89]Whatever.
[91:02.19]100 bucks?
[91:07.14]You kidding me?
[91:07.72]I got 24 grand.
[91:09.94]That's a piss in the pot.
[91:13.73]Plenty of money.
[91:15.31]You think it's a money problem?
[91:16.51]Watch this.
[91:17.45]Whatever this is, I'm giving money to it.
[91:23.61]I can't even do it.
[91:24.29]I can't give money to it.
[91:28.31]I'm gonna go visit my friend.
[91:31.53]Linus!
[91:33.25]See, we're matching clothes.
[91:34.97]I didn't realize that.
[91:40.25]Right.
[91:41.54]Yeah, the animals don't judge you.
[91:42.64]Whatever.
[91:44.45]We're friends.
[91:44.77]Is there anything else I can do here?
[91:50.78]Let me go look at those prizes one more time.
[91:55.50]We're gonna see how not worth it they are.
[91:58.58]Dried sunflowers.
[92:01.13]Alright, we got a stupid plot.
[92:03.29]A stupid plant pot.
[92:05.85]A dumb fedora.
[92:06.77]A scarecrow, like a Halloween themed scarecrow.
[92:13.26]And then an expensive Whole Foods fruit.
[92:15.80]I kinda want this.
[92:23.72]I want that.
[92:25.56]I'm gonna get it.
[92:34.04]Can this give me more than one?
[92:37.81]Why does it give you one?
[92:40.47]It's not like it's getting harder.
[92:52.04]Come on!
[92:53.04]I did it perfectly last time.
[92:54.32]There we go.
[92:59.19]Is there a point where this guy gets impressed with me and he gives me more than one?
[93:05.33]I swear to god it's going faster sometimes.
[93:07.92]I'm not crazy.
[93:21.94]Whatever.
[93:22.90]Put a shirt on.
[93:28.37]How do we move this forward?
[93:29.63]I want everyone to look at my cool stuff.
[93:34.01]Who do I talk to?
[93:34.61]Where's the mayor?
[93:38.65]There he is.
[93:45.55]Yeah, it is the big day.
[93:48.43]Thank you very much.
[93:50.09]Are you ready?
[93:50.55]I am ready.
[93:51.43]Let's do it.
[93:56.08]I got such good produce here.
[93:59.74]And a perfect fish.
[94:01.18]And honey.
[94:03.34]I'm the only guy on this block that sells honey.
[94:09.69]Yeah, come over and look at this one.
[94:11.85]That's pretty nice, huh?
[94:13.83]Mm-hmm.
[94:14.77]That cheese and eggs, that's so 2012.
[94:16.33]You know what I mean?
[94:18.14]That's so 2013.
[94:20.30]Fish.
[94:20.60]I mean, the fish are okay, but... Did you see those grapes?
[94:24.14]Those are totally in right now.
[94:26.18]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[94:30.12]Kun... Cho... Mr. Choi.
[94:32.88]It's Kun Choi.
[94:34.14]Thanks for subbing.
[94:34.70]Welcome.
[94:35.00]Thank you very much.
[94:37.42]Appreciate it.
[94:37.99]Welcome.
[94:38.55]Everyone, welcome him.
[94:40.05]Welcome aboard.
[94:42.48]Your Grange display has been judged.
[94:43.80]Return to Mary Lewis for the result.
[94:45.10]Did I win?
[94:45.50]What do you get for winning?
[94:46.64]Do I get money?
[94:49.28]Hey, not bad.
[94:49.84]You won second place with a rating of 84.
[94:51.23]500 star tokens?! !
[95:19.58]Do it again!
[95:21.36]I want the starfruit!
[95:24.97]God, I'm gonna get that starfruit!
[95:30.39]I got it!
[95:32.51]I got it!
[95:32.82]I got it!
[95:35.72]I got it!
[95:36.18]I can get two!
[95:40.66]I can get two starfruits!
[95:57.38]I got it!
[96:00.30]Wait, I just ate it?
[96:01.20]What's happening?
[96:07.90]You found a star drop, your mind is filled with thoughts and carrots.
[96:13.05]Why carrots?
[96:14.19]You found a star drop, your mind is filled with thoughts of carrots.
[96:22.21]What the fuck does that mean?
[96:29.37]Max energy?
[96:30.05]Alright, it was worth it.
[96:31.29]You guys didn't trust me.
[96:32.47]You guys didn't trust me.
[96:36.74]All in, all the time.
[96:41.20]Everybody was giving me shit all in every single damn time.
[96:45.40]And look at the outcome.
[96:50.39]I ate the starfruit and I became much more powerful.
[96:57.31]Oh, I put carrots as my favorite thing.
[96:58.93]Oh yeah.
[97:00.42]That was dumb.
[97:10.52]Are we done here?
[97:11.80]Can I take my display down?
[97:18.73]Yeah, thanks for judging.
[97:20.55]I'll be taking this shit back.
[97:29.21]You thought you were going to be able to take this and sell it or something?
[97:32.17]Nope.
[97:32.65]See ya.
[97:36.17]Thanks for the free shit.
[97:39.33]Suckers.
[97:43.82]Yeah.
[97:51.50]Is that it?
[97:52.38]I gotta water my night... Oh, that's over.
[97:56.16]I can't water these right now.
[98:05.50]Yeah, whatever.
[98:06.14]Oh, come on.
[98:07.78]I can get this coin.
[98:19.64]I don't want a rare crow.
[98:22.59]I can actually sell these right now.
[98:23.63]Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[98:25.61]Get some money.
[98:26.17]Some much-needed funds.
[98:32.18]How much is a can of honey worth?
[98:34.30]I'm gonna sell one of them, just see what it is.
[98:40.86]Back to bed.
[98:51.77]Only a hundred?
[98:52.29]That seems very low.
[99:00.90]Not bad.
[99:02.54]Did we break 30k?
[99:04.98]26, 27?
[99:05.38]28.
[99:05.46]Alright, today, what's on the agenda today?
[99:19.21]Water?
[99:20.65]Go get coal.
[99:22.37]That's the agenda.
[99:48.03]Hello, doggie.
[99:51.49]Some corn I can grab.
[99:55.74]Grab some corn, you know what I mean?
[99:58.78]Corn on the cob.
[100:09.12]Put flowers around the honey.
[100:14.27]Can I make flowers?
[100:17.41]How does that even work?
[100:18.67]Did I ever water these?
[100:20.21]No.
[100:28.93]Oh, honey.
[100:37.86]Refill the jug.
[100:39.22]And come back.
[100:45.04]Okay.
[100:45.23]Okay.
[100:49.60]Spa crab pots, 10k products, grass chickens, mayonnaise, jerry.
[100:55.81]That reminds me of if you just type random nonsense into autocorrect.
[100:59.95]You just did a autocorrect sentence by mashing a keyboard.
[101:16.16]We're more than halfway through fall.
[101:23.27]Oh, the flowers.
[101:24.71]Actually, you can buy the seeds from Pierre.
[101:31.97]If that guy's even open.
[101:32.95]No, sorry.
[101:33.49]It's a Wednesday.
[101:36.94]Pierre doesn't work on Wednesdays.
[101:38.38]And even when he does go to work, he doesn't man the register.
[101:43.52]So you can't buy anything.
[101:44.84]That's what happened the last two times I went there.
[101:49.72]And then I compulsory...
[101:52.73]Bought a $10,000 backpack.
[101:55.37]I blame that really on him.
[101:57.39]That's on him.
[102:01.21]Wouldn't have bought that if he was actually at the register.
[102:03.95]Think about that, guys.
[102:05.68]It's his fault.
[102:12.80]Alright.
[102:15.18]Let's do some spa.
[102:18.39]And then... I actually might want to consider...
[102:22.57]looking at building another building.
[102:25.35]Ooh, schnozberries.
[102:30.57]Wait a minute.
[102:32.23]Hazelnut, schnozberry.
[102:33.82]Okay.
[102:36.82]I... I need a mushroom.
[102:39.24]I need one of those mushrooms and I can get the care package.
[102:48.70]Where do those mushrooms grow?
[102:54.61]I think we're like down here.
[102:57.21]We're near the wizard's sanctuary.
[103:13.78]Give me a mushroom!
[103:17.71]Mushrooms?
[103:18.21]Mushrooms down?
[103:21.85]Mushrooms?
[103:24.42]Jesus, Jeremy, your farm is a mess.
[103:29.42]It's, uh, it's unkempt.
[103:30.39]Let's put it that way, it's unkempt.
[103:43.77]I swear to God, mushrooms are, like, somewhere around here.
[103:47.85]Or, like, I swear to God, I saw one by the wizard.
[103:50.37]Am I insane?
[103:51.39]I probably am.
[103:52.49]Actually, I am insane.
[103:56.07]Well, I'm not.
[104:03.29]His farm is like a sexy bed head.
[104:09.59]That is a very specific term.
[104:14.56]They can get him in the mines.
[104:22.12]Well, I'm not watering my plants tomorrow.
[104:28.62]Where is the person that builds things?
[104:36.93]Mayor, blacksmith.
[104:38.09]Who actually does house crafting?
[104:43.75]It's that lady, right?
[104:46.24]Where is she?
[104:52.75]And we're actually going to be transitioning here in like... Maybe 10, 15... After today.
[104:58.17]I think I want to play a little bit of Overwatch.
[104:59.73]Because I haven't played it.
[105:00.39]I haven't played it on stream in like a week.
[105:04.33]I'm kind of itching to play it.
[105:22.04]How many cults?
[105:27.58]Aha, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[105:32.53]Abarichi!
[105:34.93]Welcome.
[105:35.39]Thanks for subbing.
[105:36.29]Thanks.
[105:36.69]Welcome to the sub.
[105:38.29]Friends.
[105:38.95]I haven't even planted this.
[105:41.09]Oh, summer only.
[105:42.21]No, thanks.
[105:42.57]Appreciate it.
[105:43.05]Welcome.
[105:44.21]Hello, hello.
[105:51.49]Battery pack.
[105:52.09]Can I throw a battery at somebody?
[106:01.01]I'm going to bed.
[106:03.47]Fuck it.
[106:04.37]Back to bed.
[106:06.85]I watered everything already.
[106:09.29]Now we come out here.
[106:11.17]And we go to the mine and we collect what we need to collect.
[106:14.39]After, of course, we get our grapes.
[106:16.97]I'm not going to water anything today.
[106:21.50]Takes too much time and effort because I'm too stupid.
[106:30.77]There's a lot of stuff today.
[106:36.27]Go to the mine.
[106:37.89]See what's in the mine.
[106:39.41]See if I can get a mushroom.
[106:42.80]And then we're gonna play Overwatch.
[106:49.72]Overwatch after today.
[106:51.22]I mean in-game today.
[106:52.24]The video game time.
[107:02.34]And these immediately go in the dumpster.
[107:10.30]Those are normal honeys.
[107:13.09]What can I actually make cooking-wise with honey?
[107:16.03]Probably something cool, right?
[107:31.36]All right.
[107:36.94]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[107:42.58]Mosley Bird.
[107:45.25]You beautiful bird.
[107:46.73]Welcome.

[108:13.09]We'll do that first.
[108:13.73]I don't need this.
[108:20.29]But in case I find a little pool, you know, I'm gonna keep that here.
[108:22.41]Let's go donate the ancient seed.
[108:33.53]Can you post a link?

[108:53.47]Donate.
[108:55.27]I'm going to go up.
[108:57.11]Trash.
[108:58.42]Nobody outside.
[108:59.04]Nobody to yell at me.
[108:59.64]Nobody to get mad at me.
[109:02.21]I found a whole birthday cake one time.
[109:03.71]Any more trash cans to go through?
[109:12.61]That's where you find the good shit.
[109:17.38]People can judge all they want.
[109:25.24]Okay.
[109:25.54]I hope I don't regret this.
[109:35.21]I really hope I don't regret this.
[109:42.30]Ooh.
[109:43.86]Ancient seed recipe and an ancient seed.
[109:51.50]Ooh.
[109:54.71]Got it.
[109:57.31]What does this mean?
[110:00.15]What does this do?
[110:00.55]What does it mean?
[110:03.29]What does this grow into?
[110:04.96]An ancient tree?
[110:05.96]I don't know.
[110:25.13]Just full screen your face in full screen.
[110:28.80]Full screen your face in full screen.
[110:31.40]Yeah, that's a good word I just used together.
[110:35.35]Planet X spring.
[110:36.11]Alright, well, that's a long ways away.
[110:45.72]Okay, what was I doing?
[110:46.40]Oh yeah, mine.
[110:50.16]Actually, I want to see if you have anything better.
[110:56.57]Steel pickaxe.
[111:00.55]I got plenty of money.
[111:01.41]I'm doing this as soon as I can.
[111:02.55]I just need more iron.
[111:07.26]And then maybe, just maybe, maybe, maybe... I can get rid of that stupid meteorite.
[111:15.91]What about this?
[111:16.35]I don't ever go in here.
[111:17.99]But what does this place even sell?
[111:20.21]I came in here as a joke one time.
[111:32.18]Five grand?
[111:33.00]What does this do?
[111:36.02]Should I pay this guy $5,000?
[111:37.12]Is this a Ponzi scheme?
[111:40.06]I'm not joining like a pyramid scheme right now, am I?
[111:41.84]Oh, whatever.
[111:44.64]I got plenty of money.
[111:45.50]I'm gonna throw some money around.
[111:49.37]Let's do it.
[111:49.79]Okay, I am seeing a lot of freaking out.
[111:58.85]No.
[112:00.31]Don't do it, corporate scum.
[112:04.38]If you buy it, you turn... Okay, so this turns the community center into a warehouse.
[112:07.80]But hear me out.
[112:08.54]Hold on.
[112:10.54]What is in the warehouse?
[112:14.57]What do I get for my investment?
[112:19.61]I'm putting up 5,000 gold.
[112:22.21]What do I get for my investment?
[112:35.12]Bundle.
[112:36.42]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[112:41.26]Fudorosu1000.
[112:42.22]Thanks for subbing.
[112:45.44]You subbed at a perfect time during this great conflict in the chat.
[112:51.92]Thanks, though.
[112:52.28]Appreciate it.
[112:53.56]Welcome.
[113:00.22]Is this going to put that asshole Pierre out of business?
[113:04.45]Because he's been kind of not up on a Wednesday.
[113:08.67]Won't take my orders for certain things when I come in on a perfectly fine business hours.
[113:16.99]Maybe you should have thought of that, Pierre.
[113:24.30]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[113:31.57]Scut-ex.
[113:32.45]Scut-ex.
[113:33.59]Three months in a row.
[113:36.37]Much love.
[113:37.25]What do you think I should do, Scottics?
[113:39.79]What do you think?
[113:44.85]I want to get Scott's opinion on this.
[113:47.14]Let's see what he says.
[113:57.84]I just got sad.
[113:59.18]Somebody just in the chat said, please don't do it.
[114:08.62]And it's just, I'm just like... Everyone's like... I did this, I played Undertale, like, a couple months ago.
[114:39.67]I remember every decision I had in that game.
[114:41.61]People would lose their... We're doing it!
[114:45.12]Oh, I thought... I got one last chance.
[114:56.96]One last chance.
[115:41.42]I'm just kidding.
[115:42.24]I'm just kidding.
[115:42.72]Look, see, it's a joke.
[115:45.52]It was a prank.
[115:47.34]I pranked you guys.
[115:50.48]I got a prank on you guys, see?
[115:52.04]I'm exiting the game.
[115:53.84]Let me see what happens.
[115:55.88]I want to see what it looks like.
[115:56.98]Sometimes you gotta be the bad guy.
[115:58.79]Let's look.
[116:05.51]What have you done?
[116:10.44]Hey, Pierre.
[116:13.41]Maybe it's time for you to pack up your shit.
[116:16.39]Oh, 100 gold for pumpkin scenes?
[116:19.01]Guess what?
[116:20.33]I own the Jojube factory down the street, and it's only 10 gold.
[116:27.83]Have a nice winter.
[116:29.61]It's going to be cold this time.
[116:34.19]By the way, fuck you.
[116:38.79]Yes, Anakin.
[116:40.47]Fall into the dark side.
[116:42.87]Let your anger consume you.
[116:51.24]And we will rule the Senate as father and apprentice.
[116:57.10]What was the line?
[116:57.74]Father and son?
[116:58.38]No.
[117:04.19]Back to bed.
[117:16.16]And you'll all have to find out next time if I went through with it or not.
[117:19.74]Thanks for watching, because now we're going to play Overwatch.
[117:28.13]What a cliffhanger.
[117:36.80]Will Jerma go through with his terrible decision?
[117:39.67]Will, the townspeople.
[117:41.46]Out of town.
[117:42.00]You know, run out of town.
[117:43.50]Will Jerma stumble over his lines like he just did?
[117:46.28]Find out next time.
[117:48.68]On Jerma Sucks Ass at Stardew Valley.
[117:52.63]Reddit PG-13.
[117:53.29]Reddit R. Reddit X. We're gonna play Overwatch.
[117:58.13]You'll have to see next time what happens.
[118:04.48]Because I'm going to turn off Stardew Valley and either exit the game or sleep in that bed.
[118:12.14]So.
[118:14.24]Let's see.
[118:22.31]And it's going to be disappearing in about a few seconds.
[118:27.95]Hold on.
[118:30.27]Just a second.
[118:31.81]Keep your Spence up.
[118:46.37]That was fun.
[118:46.83]That was drama.
[118:47.78]There was some climax there.
[118:52.12]That was the climax of the drama that you're watching.
[118:57.38]Because who knows?
[118:58.36]Who knows what could happen?
[119:12.95]I gotta change my stream title too.
[119:18.44]I never know what's a title in Overwatch stream.
[119:20.38]Because it's just Overwatch.
[119:29.40]Um... No, that's terrible.
[119:41.49]New patch, huh, guys?
[119:42.43]What an awful stream title.
[119:43.55]Awful.
[119:43.81]Just terrible.
[119:44.47]Awful.
[119:45.27]Think of a better one.
[120:01.57]That's even worse.
[120:03.51]That's so bad.
[120:04.37]This title is fucking terrible.
[120:10.39]Actually, I kind of like it.
[120:11.85]It's awful, but I like it.
[120:13.83]Did it even go through?
[120:14.51]I have no idea.
[120:31.06]Yeah, it did.
[120:47.30]okay guys and
