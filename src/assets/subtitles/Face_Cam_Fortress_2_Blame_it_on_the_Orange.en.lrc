[01:02.38]Oh, good thing I didn't pull it out all the way.
[01:03.66]Oh, I... In a lot of my videos when I use the halves of Toichi, people say...
[01:12.71]I just smash your scalp in the face people always asking how can you pull the half the toy g out like this and Not be able to go back like for instance I just switch back right to the sticky bomb launcher if you do not let it get to the end of its animation like that if You can still use your other weapons, but if you go all the way like that now I cannot switch back But a lot of people have been asking that in the recent videos of devil man at least now I pulled it out I got to kill somebody so who am I gonna hit I?
[01:41.16]Hello.
[01:42.42]I am not a spy, I promise you that much.
[01:46.38]Give me that health.
[01:47.62]Give me the health!
[01:48.26]Give me the health!
[01:50.80]Oh, it worked!
[01:51.30]Oh!
[01:57.38]Gonna eat my Clementine.
[01:59.98]I love Clementine so much.
[02:02.90]They're so orangey and delicious.
[02:06.78]Gonna eat this Clementine.
[02:09.84]On camera.
[02:11.77]Because I'm hungry.
[02:13.27]And this is becoming way more difficult than it needs to be.
[02:17.89]Look at what I've done to this thing in like the five seconds I've been trying to open it.
[02:21.17]Like the ten seconds.
[02:21.93]Like, look at this.
[02:23.94]I can't eat that.
[02:26.62]Oh, bumping the mic.
[02:27.30]Alright, hold on.
[02:30.04]They're like pushing the cart right now.
[02:31.80]I can't like sit there and like eat oranges.
[02:34.02]You are maybe a spy.
[02:36.10]No!
[02:37.13]No!
[02:37.53]Don't let him get it!
[02:39.15]It's all the orange's fault!
[02:41.01]It's all Clementine's fault!
[02:43.47]I'll kill this guy, at least.
[02:46.27]Don't let him get it!
[02:47.69]Do everything you can!
[02:48.57]I... I blame the orange.
[02:56.80]I can't believe that just happened.
[02:58.70]I'm sitting here eating fruits and vegetables.
[03:00.68]Well, there's no vegetables here, but... I can't open this!
[03:03.69]I cannot eat this!
[03:05.66]Alright, let's just time travel.
[03:07.30]And I'm gonna eat that.
[03:08.67]And go.
[03:10.35]Alright.
[03:11.07]We've time traveled successfully to the beginning of the match.
[03:14.61]And I got a sticky trap laid down here.
[03:16.25]Who is going to get their face absolutely exploded?
[03:19.65]Hopefully it's you.
[03:21.14]And it's gonna be the sniper.
[03:22.38]Here we go.
[03:22.76]Bye!
[03:24.22]Let's do it again.
[03:25.94]Let's do it again.
[03:27.58]Any more unsuspecting people?
[03:30.00]Let's go around this side now.
[03:33.87]They're going to be weary of me being there.
[03:35.89]Weary, weary.
[03:37.87]Hey!
[03:38.19]Hey!
[03:38.69]Oh.
[03:40.71]Oh, this is going to be crazy!
[03:45.51]How did that heavy not die?
[03:46.92]How is this heavy a superhuman?
[03:48.70]What the hell?
[03:49.96]Dude, that heavy took like 7,000 damage.
[03:51.14]Oh, I'm so scared.
[03:57.14]You gotta take those hits.
[03:59.12]Got him.
[04:00.32]Did I kill that Pyro?
[04:01.86]Who the hell did I even just kill right there?
[04:03.48]Oh my goodness.
[04:08.55]Whoa!
[04:10.81]Whoa!
[04:12.03]Oh, that's a double cheeseburger right there.
[04:15.29]Getting lucky.
[04:17.63]What do we got?
[04:18.09]We got Soldier.
[04:20.43]Soldier, you want to get on that cot?
[04:22.73]I don't think that's a good idea.
[04:23.77]Oh, this heavy is... This tevi is buttered toast right here.
[04:26.76]You ready for this?
[04:31.34]Hiding in the window.
[04:33.36]In that window.
[04:36.42]I love just sitting in this window.
[04:38.54]It's just like such a bastard move.
[04:40.36]Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[04:44.42]Anybody else?
[04:47.46]What just happened with that?
[04:49.76]Oh, give me health.
[04:53.52]Spy!
[04:57.92]Oh, this guy's gonna kill me!
[04:59.84]Oh, good shot!
[05:02.21]I would say your name on camera, but I'm not going to.
[05:06.09]Rumpelstiltskin.
[05:10.53]Mmm.
[05:13.38]Wow, did those two guys... I love that Heavy's mask!
[05:16.26]That Heavy's mask was hilarious.
[05:18.52]He's just lying there, like, dead on the corner with the stupid seal mask on.
[05:23.08]God, I love Halloween so much.
[05:25.31]So much goofy S-H-I-double-H-I-H-I-T.
[05:29.11]It's so much fun.
[05:31.51]What's going on here, man?
[05:34.19]What's going on here?
[05:35.01]Hey, Scout!
[05:37.02]Get face-stabbed!
[05:38.66]I almost killed myself with my own bombs.
[05:43.87]Damn it!
[05:44.93]Oh, by the way, if you're wondering, I didn't eat the Clementine.
[05:50.11]Oh, boy.
[05:52.45]Vood, I have no space in my backpack.
[05:56.49]I need to buy, a lot of people are saying I need to buy one of those backpack expanders.
[06:01.59]I'm definitely going to do that.
[06:04.20]And you may or may not sometime soon here see a backpack giveaway.
[06:10.12]Could happen, just saying.
[06:11.86]It could happen in the next couple weeks, probably, I would think so.
[06:17.21]Hey, look, it's a fish!
[06:18.43]Ah!
[06:19.63]No, don't snipe me, you son of a bitch!
[06:22.09]Get him with that!
[06:23.21]How did I not direct you?
[06:24.05]No, I'm going up there.
[06:24.81]I'm going up top, man, and you're getting smashed.
[06:30.86]Oh, so much stuff is about to be destroyed up here.
[06:33.06]Where's the teleporter?
[06:35.30]I know it's up here.
[06:36.20]Definitely right here.
[06:37.76]No.
[06:38.46]Where the hell is it?
[06:40.17]Oh, it's right there.
[06:41.65]Your teleporter is about to be down!
[06:44.93]And I apparently killed... Oh my goodness, God gracious, look what I just did.
[06:50.46]He was coming through the teleporter with his sentry gun.
[06:53.64]That engineer.
[06:54.96]Oh, now I feel pretty bad.
[06:56.06]Because if that was me, I'd be very upset about that.
[07:04.45]Come on!
[07:05.11]Come on, lay in traps!
[07:08.50]How did I get all the way back here?
[07:10.66]It is beyond me.
[07:13.14]I gotta kill somebody with the sword.
[07:14.78]Get my health back.
[07:16.78]Or just be like a complete nuisance.
[07:19.40]That works too.
[07:22.46]Come on, come around the corner.
[07:23.26]Come around the corner.
[07:26.11]Oh!
[07:27.85]They're gonna cap this and we're gonna lose.
[07:29.59]I gotta get up.
[07:33.51]I'm so scared of them from behind.
[07:35.63]Here we go.
[07:36.77]This is where...
[07:39.97]I'm gonna kill, like, three people right here with the sword.
[07:45.95]Come on!
[07:46.67]Come here!
[07:48.39]Come here, you!
[07:51.01]One, there's one.
[07:51.57]Let's get three.
[07:52.25]Let's get this sniper, too.
[07:53.87]No, it's a heavy!
[07:55.13]Oh!
[07:58.37]Heavy had to ruin my fun.
[08:03.79]I think they're actually gonna win, though.
[08:04.81]That's the bad part.
[08:09.64]Maybe.
[08:10.84]Maybe.
[08:12.42]Should I stay demo?
[08:13.30]Yeah, there's only one.
[08:14.02]I'm going to stay demo.
[08:14.98]I'm staying demo, man.
[08:20.49]Come around the corner.
[08:21.55]We got a sentry gun.
[08:22.35]We're good.
[08:22.69]I think we got this.
[08:24.17]We got two sentry guns.
[08:26.73]Oh my goodness.
[08:30.89]That's his crit.
[08:31.51]That's going to hit somebody.
[08:32.39]Whoa, I'm going to die.
[08:35.17]Dispenser, dispenser, dispenser.
[08:37.48]There is no dispenser.
[08:42.65]Come on.
[08:46.23]They're going to come around the corner.
[08:48.01]I need health.
[08:48.39]I need to put more stickies than one is what I need to do.
[08:50.61]There we go.
[08:54.12]Get that dispenser built, baby.
[08:58.50]Get these stickies up all over the place.
[09:00.36]All over the place.
[09:04.51]I'm not confident right now.
[09:07.17]All it's going to take is an uber charge and they will push in big time.
[09:11.59]No!
[09:11.91]Get that scout!
[09:13.81]That guy's standing completely still!
[09:20.04]No!
[09:20.50]Oh, good shot!
[09:21.96]Good shot!
[09:27.56]Orange pieces all over my desk.
[09:32.45]If they get an uber, this is going to be a big problem.
[09:36.95]I kill plenty of problems.
[09:40.99]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[09:42.69]No!
[09:46.69]Oh, well.
[09:48.08]But that's gonna wrap it up, guys.
[09:49.62]Thank you so much for watching this edition of Fae Scam Fortress 2.
[09:53.76]And I'm gonna try to actually eat this.
[09:56.26]I tried before.
[09:58.14]You know what?
[09:58.88]Screw it.
[10:03.01]That was disgusting.
[10:04.77]Because the seeds in this...
[10:13.12]I didn't know there were seeds.
[10:15.02]So that was just really, really an unexpected texture.
[10:18.70]But that's going to wrap up the video, guys.
[10:21.22]I'll see you all soon.
[10:23.66]Thank you for watching again.
[10:24.62]And I'll see you all next time.
[10:25.94]And of course, take care, everybody.
