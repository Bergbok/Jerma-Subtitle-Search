[00:05.24]So I just recently beat Firewatch and I came across a feature that I haven't really seen very many people talk about.
[00:11.67]There's a disposable camera in this game that allows you to take pictures.
[00:15.37]You can take a picture of whatever you want.
[00:17.47]It never leaves your inventory and you have it throughout the whole game.
[00:21.32]But the cool feature is they actually ask you if you want to develop those photos and they will mail them to you.
[00:28.61]And that's exactly what I did.
[00:30.21]They got here today, and I kind of want to just go through them with you guys.
[00:33.13]Like, I thought it'd be a really neat idea to look at them together and see what I took pictures of.
[00:37.18]Now, it has been a while, so I don't actually know or remember what's on these.
[00:45.08]Hey, your memories have arrived, huh?
[00:46.80]Oh, that's real cute.
[00:47.68]Photodome.
[00:48.96]Look at that.
[00:50.92]Okay, let's open them up.
[00:51.68]Let's see what we got.
[00:58.31]First one is the sky.
[01:01.29]Skies can be cool sometimes, I guess.
[01:05.83]That's a rock.
[01:07.59]The pretty interesting growth of a rock.
[01:09.51]The way that it was growing out of the ground was pretty cool.
[01:14.14]I think that's the inside of a bush.
[01:16.68]Yeah, that's the inside of a bush.
[01:24.67]I think I was trying to take a picture of a...
[01:31.08]These are fucking terrible.
[01:34.15]Seriously.
[01:36.57]Did I take these?
[01:38.91]What even is this?
[01:41.89]Is that a thumbprint?
[01:45.04]Oh, here we go, there's a little selfie there, you know, selfie action, sometimes you gotta take one.
[01:49.20]Okay.
[01:55.06]That's a private one.
[01:57.82]That's gonna go in a different pile.
[02:00.36]It's going to go in the privacy pile.
[02:03.16]Hey, a fence.
[02:03.72]Take a look at that.
[02:04.34]Interesting, right?
[02:07.94]What am I even taking a picture of here?
[02:12.04]Hey, there you go.
[02:13.28]Got a picture of the toilet, you know?
[02:15.94]Oh, this one's great.
[02:16.54]I like this one.
[02:17.00]This one's like, there was a rock on a stump, and I thought, well, that's such an interesting rock.
[02:21.13]That's so odd.
[02:22.43]Why would there be a rock on a stump like that?
[02:32.13]Uh, I don't know why there is a box up there, I guess.
[02:35.51]Oh, here we go, here we go.
[02:37.69]I remember this tree.
[02:39.03]I remember saying to myself, man, it's got such interesting moss growing on the side.
[02:42.61]I got to get a picture with it.
[02:43.57]So there you go.
[02:44.45]There it is.
[02:50.77]Privacy file.
[02:52.65]God damn it.
[02:57.59]What?
[03:00.05]What the fuck?
[03:03.15]Who am I?
[03:11.64]I don't know who the fuck this is.
[03:14.08]I have no idea.
[03:15.16]I've never met this person before in my entire life.
[03:21.56]Another rock.
[03:22.92]Good one.
[03:25.02]Oh look, another rock!
[03:25.88]Oh cool, there's a sunset that you could have taken a picture of too.
[03:28.46]Oh, good rock in the way!
[03:31.17]Come on.
[03:32.56]Come on!
[03:33.18]You know what?
[03:34.38]I apologize for this.
[03:39.48]Oh my god!
[03:40.18]That's somebody's asshole.
[03:48.62]I hope it's not mine.
[03:51.26]Nah, it's mine.
[03:52.38]It's mine.
[03:52.92]Do something cool.
[03:54.14]So interesting.
[03:54.78]Get them developed.
[03:56.30]Look at this.
[03:57.08]I did something cool, guys.
[04:09.95]Hey Ma, don't look in the trash.
