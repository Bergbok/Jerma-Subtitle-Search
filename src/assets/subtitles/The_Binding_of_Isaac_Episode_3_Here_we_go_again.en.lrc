[00:08.69]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:10.11]Welcome to episode 3 of The Binding of Isaac, German Let's Play!
[00:16.15]Not really a Let's Play in parentheses.
[00:18.49]So, I took a lot of you guys' advice, and I'm not using the mouse anymore, as you can probably tell.
[00:25.25]I'm using the keys, and it is actually a little easier to move around, so thank you for that.
[00:30.73]And I'm also not going to miss any secret rooms, or I'm going to try not to miss any secret rooms.
[00:35.89]So, I died, as you just saw in the last episode, so... Let's, uh... Let's start it, huh?
[00:43.93]Alright, that's fine.
[00:45.23]Coins, I can't get you.
[00:46.61]Maybe later.
[00:49.14]Bug bitches.
[00:51.96]So yeah, a lot of you guys were like, oh my god, you're missing so many secrets.
[00:56.80]And I am sorry.
[00:58.14]I did kind of just jump into this game without really thinking about a whole lot.
[01:02.30]So I'll try to keep that to a minimum now.
[01:05.71]Can't get those right now.
[01:07.84]Let's go up.
[01:10.82]Okay.
[01:12.68]Oh, there it is.
[01:13.40]See, there's the blue tinted rock.
[01:15.60]A lot of you guys said, look for the blue tinted rock, so there's one right there.
[01:19.14]I'll remember this room.
[01:21.36]Let's go to the right.
[01:24.02]Never seen these enemies before.
[01:26.60]Like jumping jack freak shows.
[01:29.66]Oh my, it is so much easier to aim with the arrow keys.
[01:35.42]Oh, and you also said to hit the chocolate syrup, because there could be items in there.
[01:39.48]So I will.
[01:42.32]Hmm, item boss?
[01:43.52]Really?
[01:44.08]This is it?
[01:46.05]That's not very many rooms.
[01:48.91]First item.
[01:50.11]Mr. Boom.
[01:51.87]Mr. Boom.
[01:53.85]So that's not a bomb, that's... Maybe it is.
[01:57.65]Should I blow up the thing to get the thing?
[02:00.55]I don't know.
[02:02.99]I'm gonna do it, whatever.
[02:08.03]Small rock has appeared in the basement.
[02:11.33]Ooh!
[02:12.99]Damage up!
[02:14.05]There you go.
[02:14.71]Oh, that's morbid.
[02:15.61]Oh my god.
[02:17.19]There's a rock sticking out of my head.
[02:20.93]So that's awesome.
[02:21.87]That's awesome.
[02:22.39]So when you blow up the tinted rocks, items can go out.
[02:26.10]I'm cool with that.
[02:27.54]So that's it.
[02:28.06]There's nothing else.
[02:29.30]Wow.
[02:29.70]Okay.
[02:31.92]Isaac versus Monstro.
[02:34.04]I've already beat this guy.
[02:35.08]I know what he does.
[02:36.44]Let's go!
[02:38.15]Yeah, go ahead.
[02:38.57]Come on.
[02:39.30]Come on.
[02:39.50]What do you got?
[02:40.68]You ain't got nothing, you friggin' goofy-toothed bastard.
[02:44.42]Keep pukin'.
[02:46.80]Alright, the damage up is... I can tell it's doing more damage.
[02:49.48]Oh god, I'm getting hit.
[02:52.46]Wow.
[02:54.00]So definitely those spirit... Oh, I hit a spirit heart.
[02:56.23]That's cool.
[02:57.95]What do you got, Mastro?
[03:01.21]Oh, it is... This is so much better.
[03:03.83]Using the mouse was just so counterintuitive.
[03:08.29]I got you.
[03:09.99]Nothing.
[03:11.35]I am gonna beat this stupid level.
[03:14.08]Not level, I mean this series of levels.
[03:18.42]And you are dead.
[03:19.64]What'd I get, what'd I get, what'd I get?
[03:21.78]Underwear.
[03:24.44]Mom's underwear.
[03:25.55]Oh my god, I look ridiculous.
[03:32.13]Oh, let's keep going.
[03:35.71]The basement.
[03:36.77]Level two!
[03:38.60]Let me take a sip of my delicious soda pop.
[03:42.84]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[03:44.84]Up or down?
[03:46.48]Alright, I'll go up.
[03:47.16]I heard you.
[03:47.78]I heard you through the computer screen.
[03:49.12]You said to go up.
[03:52.25]Alright, you guys, what do you got?
[03:55.15]Were these... Okay, somebody in the comments wanted to let me know.
[03:57.61]These characters, these guys that look like the fluffy cauliflowers, were they in another game?
[04:04.05]Or in another series or something.
[04:05.37]I feel like Edward McMillan or McMullen is the guy that is the artistic brains behind all this.
[04:11.89]And, oh my god.
[04:14.08]Should I go in?
[04:15.76]I'm going to the item room.
[04:16.56]I have a key.
[04:17.32]I'm going in here.
[04:19.36]Hell yeah.
[04:21.62]Bobby Bomb.
[04:22.58]Homing Bombs?
[04:23.48]What the hell does that mean?
[04:25.95]I'm gonna do it.
[04:27.25]I'm gonna knock this out of the park.
[04:29.61]I can't even... I need a key.
[04:32.43]Damn it.
[04:34.16]It's alright.
[04:35.34]But yeah, Edward McMullen is the guy responsible for this game, so I figured a lot of these guys must be from a lot of his other works, and I just opened up the floodgates right there.
[04:44.68]I don't know if that was a good idea.
[04:45.66]We got it.
[04:48.08]Come on.
[04:49.06]Oh, the green one!
[04:49.98]Somebody told me the green ones are, like, worth more.
[04:52.16]Ooh!
[04:53.54]They were.
[04:54.04]They totally were.
[04:57.26]Doing good so far.
[04:58.38]So far, so good.
[05:00.62]Aw, dammit.
[05:02.66]Die already!
[05:04.26]Geez Louise, with a piece of cheese.
[05:07.98]Nice.
[05:09.60]Nothing in the chocolate syrup.
[05:10.57]I'm gonna go open that chest.
[05:12.53]I am absolutely gonna go open that chest right now.
[05:14.75]And probably get my ass kicked.
[05:17.15]What is it?
[05:18.17]A bunch of... Oh, that was... I don't know if I like that.
[05:23.47]I also read somebody said to not use the bombs just to kill random enemies.
[05:27.30]You need them later or something, somebody mentioned.
[05:29.82]So I will heed by that advice.
[05:32.76]And I will not do it.
[05:35.40]Look at these crying babies.
[05:37.65]Oh, no.
[05:38.41]Did I really get hit by that?
[05:39.93]That's a larky.
[05:42.45]Come on.
[05:45.91]I'm going to cook you on an open fire, baby.
[05:48.71]And another chest.
[05:50.43]And I don't need any of it.
[05:53.23]I'm going to go down.
[05:54.35]I'm not going to go right.
[05:54.99]I'm going to go down.
[05:58.69]I'm not sure if that was a great idea or not.
[06:02.20]Not sure, but yeah, I swear to God I've seen these guys from something else.
[06:07.44]So in the comments, let me know what I'm talking about.
[06:11.20]If I'm crazy, I'm crazy.
[06:12.56]If not, then I've seen them somewhere.
[06:16.93]I think I'm gonna go down.
[06:17.71]Oh, will you get over here?
[06:21.43]You rat bastard, get over here.
[06:24.33]Alright, good to go.
[06:26.21]Getting stuck on these rocks.
[06:29.33]These things remind me of fleas.
[06:32.99]Oh, a chest, cool.
[06:36.27]Coins, coins, coins!
[06:39.57]This is, see, okay, this is crazy.
[06:41.62]The last level that I did was like, less than, like, five rooms.
[06:48.30]Ooh, pills.
[06:50.34]Alright, somebody also said, don't take the pills, because it could be bad.
[06:55.54]What, what, what is going on?
[06:57.86]This is a boss?
[06:59.27]This is not a boss room, what is going on here?
[07:02.58]Oh my god.
[07:04.72]This game is just trolling me right now.
[07:06.12]It is a troll.
[07:06.70]It's a troll face.
[07:11.31]I'm gonna die.
[07:15.37]Oh boy.
[07:17.55]So what, this is a mini boss room?
[07:18.85]Get the hell out of here.
[07:20.57]No!
[07:21.55]Damn it.
[07:22.07]I'm gonna die.
[07:23.03]No.
[07:23.53]God.
[07:26.10]Geez.
[07:28.00]Oh, Q the Fool?
[07:30.84]So what- which one of these should I take?
[07:33.86]I need heart- ugh.
[07:35.68]I have no idea what this does.
[07:38.23]Somebody's probably screaming at the video right now.
[07:40.53]Pick the pills back up!
[07:43.11]I'm not gonna.
[07:43.87]I'm keeping this thing.
[07:45.51]I need life.
[07:46.85]Oh, if I die right now, I'm gonna- I'm gonna throw up blood.
[07:49.63]Blood is gonna puke out of my mouth.
[07:51.77]I might have to just- I'm gonna hit Q. I'm doing it!
[07:55.31]What?
[07:56.79]What just happened?
