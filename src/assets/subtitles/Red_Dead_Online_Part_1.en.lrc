[00:02.41]That title could be better, couldn't it?
[00:03.75]That's as literal as you can get.
[00:08.26]And that's not even Red Dead 2.
[00:09.30]That's Red Dead Multiplayer.
[00:11.30]What if people don't know I'm playing the new one?
[00:17.50]How about Rootin' Tootin' Cowboy 2?
[00:19.64]Let's see.
[00:22.29]Red Dead.
[00:24.99]There's no Redemption in there.
[00:27.51]That's the first one.
[00:28.21]That's the one that was for PlayStation 2.
[00:33.08]Red Dead... I don't know.
[00:34.20]How do you... Multiplayer.
[00:40.49]Bruton Tootin 2 multiplayer.
[00:48.75]Cowboys using the internet.
[00:54.85]No, but that's not even in the game, though.
[01:05.03]Alright, how about this?
[01:06.59]Alright, give me a sec.
[01:07.82]One sec.
[01:43.34]There.
[01:45.40]I made it an IGN article.
[01:48.06]Is that better?
[01:54.94]The Lawless Land of Red Dead Redemption 2 Online.
[02:07.02]And then in brackets it's going to say, Watch out for gnomes.
[02:10.20]This stream is known to gnome.
[02:13.84]But anyway, hi guys.
[02:14.56]I didn't even... I gotta make a fucking tweet.
[02:17.60]I gotta see.
[02:18.26]I gotta make a tweet first.
[02:21.62]Is this sponsored?
[02:25.03]I don't think you can even get a Rockstar game sponsorship.
[02:29.39]I don't think that exists.
[02:30.43]I'm not sure it's a thing.
[02:38.17]They're Gnome to Gnome.
[02:41.42]Why am I... I'm saying this right now.
[02:43.40]I don't even like that thing.
[02:44.96]Alright, let's move this over here.
[02:57.18]So we can actually see the game.
[03:00.86]I'd say that's a good idea, isn't it?
[03:02.32]I have to sign my life away, though.
[03:04.66]That's the thing.
[03:07.02]This doesn't have, like...
[03:09.48]Online policies.
[03:12.97]Just want to make sure everyone's aware on this channel.
[03:15.33]I just want to wait until people trickle in so I can talk about it.
[03:20.03]Give me one second.
[03:32.53]What if I don't?
[03:36.82]There's, like, fucking people smoking motorcycles by.
[03:40.79]Just like... I can still hear that guy.
[03:55.43]All right, so for those of you that are fairly new to the channel, you know, whatever, I want to make sure that what I'm doing, because I come from a law background.
[04:05.76]Before Twitch, I was in a law firm.
[04:10.94]My parents owned, they were a dual, they were a husband and wife law team, and I was the son, and they were going to bring me up as like the law prince.
[04:20.13]So I need to read this shit, and I'm going to read it the whole time.
[04:23.19]So I need to know what I'm getting myself into.
[04:25.91]So what we do is... My mom and dad aren't going to like me anymore!
[04:48.70]Hey, welcome to Red Dead 2 Online.
[04:50.42]I'm excited.
[04:52.66]You just woke my dad up.
[04:53.86]Hey dad!
[04:58.51]It's me, the law prince!
[05:08.97]Another father.
[05:09.95]Alright, so how does this work?
[05:11.73]Am I gonna have fun?
[05:13.09]Should I turn off voice chat already?
[05:16.69]Is there a story here?
[05:19.75]I'm so excited.
[05:21.47]I can't wait for the first person that, right when I fucking spawn, puts me into a hogtie.
[05:28.11]I can't wait.
[05:28.69]I gotta make my character.
[05:29.63]Choose a character.
[05:31.07]Okay, we're gonna go with this guy.
[05:48.28]How much different is their character creator?
[05:56.38]What's that, 6-1?
[05:57.10]Oh, we gotta get a good name.
[06:00.17]Good name.
[06:05.45]Hmm.
[06:06.27]I don't know what he looks like quite yet, so...
[06:14.41]A beer?
[06:15.05]No, it can't be just a beer.
[06:17.31]It's got to be something better than that.
[06:21.65]No, I'm not even going to look at chat.
[06:23.09]I'm not even looking at chat right now.
[06:24.53]I'm going to come up with my own name.
[06:26.19]From what I hear, you ain't leaving us anytime soon.
[06:48.61]No, no, what the fuck?
[07:18.99]No, not Prawn Y. Prawny... Prawny Phil.
[07:21.85]Prawny PM.
[07:22.43]Prawny Phil.
[07:23.01]Prawny Philadelphia.
[07:27.19]Prawny philosophy.
[07:29.81]Prawny Philip.
[07:31.88]Prawny Philip.
[07:48.12]Philip is better.
[07:49.32]Why though?
[07:50.92]Because, just wait till I make his hands.
[07:53.22]No, no, probably Philip G.
[08:16.84]That's his name.
[08:17.64]Prani Philip.
[08:19.00]Prani Philip.
[08:26.41]Prani.
[08:27.13]Prani.
[08:30.39]That's an old west name.
[08:33.33]Prani Phil.
[08:35.87]Oh, fuck.
[08:36.41]I know why I named him that.
[08:37.44]I don't know.
[08:37.82]I was thinking of Bill Murray last night.
[08:40.82]That's Punxsutawney Phil from Groundhog Day.
[08:45.76]Oh, well.
[08:51.06]Okay, let's see.
[08:59.32]Oh, dude!
[09:00.38]I took a picture of my face every day for five years.
[09:04.73]That looks good.
[09:31.04]Dude, I took a picture of my body every day for three days.
[09:34.64]This is what happened.
[09:38.48]This is what my body did.
[09:44.74]All right, this is fine.
[09:55.79]Should it be like 18?
[09:56.35]This guy's 18.
[10:03.00]That's a lie.
[10:05.98]Does it actually change your face?
[10:11.82]No, this doesn't change anything.
[10:12.82]60, no, he's gonna be 18.
[10:21.91]Dude, I took a picture of my birth certificate, of my birthday cards every year since I was 18.
[10:36.43]He had a heart attack.
[10:37.21]Unfortunately.
[10:52.02]Brawny build!
[10:52.84]Brawny, skinny, athletic.
[10:54.56]He's gonna... I mean, I have to make a brawny guy.
[11:01.49]I can't just not make a guy brawny, right?
[11:07.30]Carefree, road, broad, narrow.
[11:14.75]The closer they are to the bridge of my nose, the better.
[11:17.93]That's just the way it is.
[11:18.73]That looks pretty good.
[11:25.80]How do I change his name?
[11:28.40]Wait, can I go even further than this?
[11:31.08]No.
[11:31.74]Customize, though.
[11:34.16]Oh, damn, you can't.
[11:38.87]Give him high.
[11:41.49]Brown.
[11:42.63]Deep brows.
[11:43.49]Eye color.
[11:50.98]Green.
[11:54.96]Eye redness.
[11:56.38]We get red eyes.
[12:01.14]Alright, this is the seventh.
[12:02.00]This is the eighth dwarf.
[12:04.25]Looks smoky.
[12:14.52]Gnome.
[12:15.20]No, it's not a gnome.
[12:16.96]I said dwarf.
[12:18.54]Like, seven dwarves.
[12:19.97]It's not the seven... It's not the seven gnomes, guys.
[12:22.87]That looks good.
[12:26.31]Ah, right there.
[12:33.30]High position.
[12:34.04]Up.
[12:35.00]Yeah, actually down.
[12:36.26]Down and in.
[12:38.83]Alright, looks good.
[12:40.75]Nose.
[12:42.19]Neutral... How do I customize?
[12:49.31]It's gotta be low and wide.
[12:50.69]And it's gotta be long.
[12:54.49]Long and long and to the... Let's see, long and to the left, maybe?
[13:01.84]Haha, it's a funny character.
[13:03.16]I haven't even made him yet!
[13:13.95]Haven't even made the guy what you can't say that yet.
[13:16.33]I haven't even made him Just wait till I get to his hands Smoocher what the fuck does that mean?
[13:33.30]Mouth position up is fine.
[13:35.70]I'm not gonna.
[13:36.04]I don't think I'm gonna have this beard I
[13:42.51]Uh, thin and narrow on the upper lip and then like a like a big Like he's got like he's got like fucking chew in his mouth Okay, yeah, that looks good
[14:20.44]Keep the beard.
[14:21.26]Well, the beard is still there.
[14:25.56]It's just Jerma Pluto.
[14:30.02]No, from the side.
[14:31.06]Look at him from the side.
[14:32.09]He looks like that henchman from the Looney Tunes.
[14:47.10]Tilt high and wide.
[14:50.98]Go deep.
[14:52.36]Deep chin depth.
[14:54.88]Okay.
[14:57.23]Alright.
[14:58.63]So, is it a whistle?
[15:06.93]He's like a bird.
[15:07.79]Clarity?
[15:09.55]Clarity?
[15:18.81]So what if it's not clear?
[15:19.93]Oh, it's really breathy.
[15:25.05]It's like going through his teeth.
[15:32.09]T's ready.
[15:43.99]I like the really high pitched one.
[15:45.33]That means anybody can hear me from a mile away.
[15:50.68]Alright, style.
[15:54.96]Ow!
[15:56.48]Ugh!
[15:59.30]Jesus!
[16:02.31]These are not whistles, this is... I just turned on the TV at Grandma's house.
[16:06.49]Alright, that one's fine.
[16:19.77]Alright, attributes.
[16:21.87]Health.
[16:22.89]Oh, this is where we're going to be careful.
[16:24.67]Two points left.
[16:27.71]Can I not pull points away?
[16:31.67]I'm going to probably say health.
[16:35.01]Health is probably the most important thing.
[16:37.05]Health and stamina.
[16:37.99]Forget about Deadeye.
[16:38.88]You can use Deadeye online.
[16:45.08]How does that work on the internet?
[16:47.04]You turn off everybody's game for five seconds?
[16:52.60]Are you able to actually do that to other players?
[16:59.10]I'm just going to make him really burly.
[17:01.79]Health is most important.
[17:02.81]I want to be able to run around and punch people and stuff.
[17:04.97]I like all funny.
[17:07.67]Okay, attributes.
[17:08.53]How do I change this?
[17:11.37]Ronnie Phillip.
[17:19.27]Turn-based.
[17:24.55]appearance scrolled down.
[17:27.07]Oh, okay.
[17:30.21]This is the only complaint I ever had about Red Dead Redemption 2, is you have all this room below this, like, I know the number is there, but I wish they would just extend that menu down, like, three slots.
[17:42.15]Alright, so we got mouth and lips, did that, ears, cheeks, here we go.
[17:47.94]Goofy, large.
[17:52.32]You can click on them.
[17:54.84]I don't have my... I got a controller in my hand.
[17:58.49]Neutral... No, we're not doing the comedy ears.
[18:01.05]I could make another Snow White reference here, though.
[18:08.13]These are all the dwarves.
[18:09.85]Small, droopy, goofy.
[18:12.33]Hold on a minute.
[18:13.97]Goofy, neutral, large, small, droopy, gah, and there's only like four, only like five gnomes, nevermind.
[18:23.70]Keep that one.
[18:25.60]Cheeks, let's take off, I need to take this off.
[18:29.86]Wide, gaunt, teeth, chompers, plum, wore out.
[18:37.54]I need to take off the hair for a second here.
[18:58.64]I mean, this one is pretty good.
[19:01.16]I'm not gonna do this one.
[19:02.22]This one's too easy to just be the fucking weirdo online.
[19:15.22]No, I like this one.
[19:19.51]This one is just weird enough.
[19:26.01]And the guy's 18.
[19:29.73]Blonde hair, yeah, that's fine.
[19:31.89]Facial hair, okay.
[19:45.06]18 with a full, like, gray beard.
[19:52.94]Like, dirty, that's fine.
[19:55.02]No, I don't like that.
[19:57.90]No, actually, that's okay.
[20:02.27]Lifestyle.
[20:09.51]What is it?
[20:10.37]What's going on?
[20:12.63]Complexion.
[20:15.47]Get rid of the facial hair.
[20:16.26]What are they talking about?
[20:17.64]Oh.
[20:23.38]Oh, I see.
[20:23.96]Okay.
[20:27.04]He's 18. 18.
[20:29.86]I mean, he could be, right?
[20:31.35]Like, couldn't he be 18?
[20:32.39]This is just Chris Griffin.
[20:37.09]I accidentally made Chris Griffin.
[20:40.24]Chris Griffin does look like this, and Chris Griffin is 18.
[20:42.48]Well, like, 14 or something, right?
[20:58.16]No, I'm not going to name him Chris Griffin.
[21:00.52]Why the fuck would I do that?
[21:03.12]It's not going to be Chris Griffin.
[21:08.83]No.
[21:10.77]No.
[21:19.58]Do it.
[21:20.08]Do it.
[21:38.96]It looks like Owen Wilson.
[21:40.98]Chris Griffin.
[21:52.37]No, I'm gonna keep the facial hair off, but his name is Prawny Phil, okay?
[21:58.69]I'm gonna keep the fucking stupid hair.
[22:00.47]I'm gonna keep his fucked up face, but I'm not changing his name to Chris Griffin.
[22:10.56]Okay.
[22:11.16]Attributes.
[22:11.62]We already did it.
[22:12.30]Appearance.
[22:13.70]That's prawny fill.
[22:21.13]Get his beard back.
[22:22.09]I kind of like it like this.
[22:27.71]No, that's it.
[22:28.31]What?
[22:28.53]What?
[22:45.05]What's in the background there?
[22:56.65]No, guys, this is not all the... This is... This is... Prawny Phil.
[23:04.18]Dumb and dumber.
[23:05.62]It really does look like... What's... Not Lloyd.
[23:08.40]Harry.
[23:09.22]No, it is... It's Harry, right?
[23:16.23]It's just Harry from Dumb and Dumber.
[23:25.42]I can't wait to get a shotgun shot directly into the back of my head when I spawn at the newbie level one.
[23:32.07]Welcome to Goldshire.
[23:33.81]Officer Jackson, move those prisoners.
[23:37.45]Officer Benton, kitchen's a staff.
[23:42.33]Officer Townsend, those rocks ain't gonna break themselves.
[23:47.11]So I'm in jail.
[23:49.79]They're gonna come across me.
[23:51.86]Hey, uh, hey, Ward!
[23:58.28]You guys think I'm out of place and you don't think that guy is?
[24:13.75]You don't think Sabretooth from X-Men is out of place, but fucking Harry from Dumb and Dumber apparently is?
[24:31.65]Red Dead Online.
[24:34.39]Yeah, I can't have a voice like this.
[24:36.47]I tell you what.
[24:37.69]I can't talk like that.
[24:38.81]I gotta keep this one.
[24:40.03]I gotta be Barney from... You lot stay calm in there.
[24:43.82]You weren't saying nothing.
[24:45.44]Well, you are now.
[24:46.36]Shut up.
[24:47.18]Well, okay.
[24:49.32]That's an interesting looking vista there, Fred.
[24:51.93]Significantly above her station.
[24:55.19]She's been reading too many goddamn books.
[24:56.61]And it's still Harry.
[24:57.47]Barney Rubble is Harry.
[24:58.93]Personally, I'm against education.
[25:02.02]Women, I mean.
[25:03.54]And men, I guess.
[25:05.28]Unnecessary.
[25:07.10]Doesn't add much to the world.
[25:09.94]Education.
[25:14.49]So how does this all start?
[25:15.81]How does this start?
[25:16.47]How does this all start?
[25:17.27]I don't know.
[25:18.79]Good day, gentlemen.
[25:20.63]Oh.
[25:21.81]Don't do anything stupid.
[25:23.29]Nobody gets shot.
[25:25.09]Act like fools and the pair of you will be dead within a minute.
[25:28.79]Now, what are your names?
[25:30.45]Jenkins.
[25:31.81]Milliken well, Mr.. Jenkins and Mr.. Milliken throw your guns to the ground and get on down here They're breaking me up.

[26:06.22]You're coming with us.
[26:24.61]Mr. Wendt, I believe it was $50 we agreed on.
[26:27.09]It was.
[26:27.83]Here's $50 each.
[26:29.29]Each?
[26:29.85]Yes.
[26:30.15]Now get out of here, both of you.
[26:32.35]My employer and I appreciate your professionalism.
[26:35.01]All we did was stand there and look tough.
[26:36.93]And you did it fantastically well.
[26:38.83]I can't wait to be... I'm gonna be some storied criminal.
[26:41.56]How about you pick up these guns?
[26:43.48]And we move out.

[26:52.96]Come along.
[26:54.00]Follow the stranger.
[26:57.06]Now!
[27:01.24]Well, this is different.
[27:04.20]You can do anything in Red Dead online too, right?
[27:07.34]I can ride a horse?
[27:08.07]Holy shit.
[27:09.81]So how do the controls work?
[27:13.13]Whoa, okay.
[27:18.89]My name is Mr. Horley, by the way.
[27:22.42]Well, hold X while riding to match the speed.
[27:24.76]This is fucking crazy.
[27:29.16]If I tilt the stick left or right, I turn left or right.
[27:32.69]How is that even possible?
[27:37.41]I'm not doing that in real life.
[27:39.97]I hope I'm right about that.
[27:42.99]Rounding you folks up.
[27:45.06]Those sham trials, they were a disgrace.
[27:48.68]Made a mockery of the rule of law.
[27:51.30]Still can't quite believe they got away with it.
[27:53.88]There's others convinced... I'm going to strangle you.
[27:56.54]Hey, whoa!
[27:58.41]Easy, man.
[27:59.15]I hope you mean in Red Dead Redemption 2 Online.
[28:03.11]You just want to put it all behind you.
[28:04.75]Forget you were in there at all.
[28:07.17]That would be fine, of course.
[28:09.29]You're just up here.
[28:11.21]There's the camp.
[28:12.41]It's your horse.
[28:14.40]That's Horley.
[28:15.78]Okay, Horley.
[28:17.75]I'm ready to start my adventure on Red Dead.
[28:23.09]There's a post right here.
[28:27.39]Alright, let's do it.
[28:29.07]Let's do it.
[28:34.20]This way.
[28:35.34]She's anxious to meet you.
[28:44.58]You see how good they're getting 3D in these things here?
[28:47.94]Hello.
[28:49.14]Jessica, the clerk.
[28:50.04]How do you do?
[28:51.38]What did you tell him?
[28:53.30]Nothing, as we discussed.
[28:55.38]Thank you, Hawley.
[28:58.49]I do hope we haven't inconvenienced you dreadfully.
[29:01.65]But seeing as you were due to be hanged in a week, I'm sure you don't object too strongly.
[29:05.33]That's very interesting to us.
[29:06.75]I know you're innocent.
[29:08.71]Well, not perhaps exactly innocent, but not guilty of what you were accused of.
[29:14.13]I know you and those who were with you that died were little more than patsies, and that you were set up by one of three men or a woman, possibly by all of them.
[29:23.02]Every time he makes a reaction, I feel like this is going to come out of his mouth.
[29:26.02]That is all I have so far.
[29:29.18]And one of these people also made Mrs. LeClerc a widow.
[29:32.46]And I will avenge my husband's death, so help me God.
[29:37.03]But I will not avenge it upon them who did not cause it, or caused it unwittingly.
[29:43.53]Anyway, I'm sure this is all a touch confusing and melodramatic.
[29:47.02]Where are my manners?
[29:49.68]Hawley, please show our guests to their tent and give them some fresh clothes to put on.
[29:54.06]Very good, madam.
[29:54.72]Then serve us both a little refreshment.
[29:56.90]Certainly, madam.
[29:58.24]Okay.
[29:58.52]This way.
[29:59.86]You'll find a change of clothes.
[30:00.68]Hey, look, it's a camp, just like in the regular main game.
[30:02.77]A few other items you might need.
[30:04.09]A lasso, a knife, and a lantern, I believe.
[30:10.81]Wardrobe, here we go.
[30:11.71]This is where we stand out from the rest of the crowd in GTA Online, because we purchased, we got the $70 hat pack.
[30:22.88]So we get to wear this instead.
[30:28.70]Alright, well I just turned him into Ebeneezer Scrooge, so that's fine too.
[30:42.34]No vest.
[30:44.99]And, no, he's going to have his shirt on.
[30:49.01]What does he look like?
[30:50.73]He's turning into something.
[30:53.69]Oh, man.
[30:57.70]It's a character from a movie.
[31:02.96]I don't know who he's turning into.
[31:04.80]It's like a Muppet or something.
[31:05.86]I forget.
[31:07.34]Who's the Muppet that looks like this?
[31:20.53]I think, well, no, that's just everyday shirt is fine.
[31:31.37]Yeah, that's good.
[31:33.09]All right, suspenders.
[31:35.67]Yeah, that looks good.
[31:39.03]I don't like that color, though.
[31:40.01]There we go.
[31:42.69]Dante from Devil May Cry.
[31:44.03]I don't, I told you, just wait till I get to his hands.
[31:56.99]Nevermind.
[31:58.32]Alright, so we got gloves.
[32:00.10]I- I don't have weapon equipment.
[32:01.76]I don't have any equipment.
[32:03.36]I can't modify.
[32:04.30]I'd like collar.
[32:06.44]Open.
[32:08.52]Full sleeves.
[32:09.30]Boots.
[32:10.78]Yeah, I like that.
[32:14.06]Okay, pants.
[32:20.11]Level up to rank 24 to unlock this item.
[32:22.71]What?
[32:31.53]Don't I already have it?
[32:37.12]Well, whatever.
[32:41.12]No, not bare feet.
[32:42.82]He'll step on a fucking log and die.
[32:45.66]Guys, this is like 1924 or something.
[32:50.08]I don't want to step on a log and die.
[32:51.46]That's how George Washington died.
[32:55.29]He got a splinter and they fucking bled him to death.
[33:06.36]All right, exit the wardrobe when you're ready.
[33:07.60]I'm ready.
[33:09.96]Exiting the wardrobe will finalize your starting clothes.
[33:11.79]Are you sure you want to leave?
[33:13.05]That ass.
[33:22.52]That looks more comfortable, Hawley.
[33:25.40]Here, madam.
[33:26.77]Why am I so small?
[33:27.55]Oh, no, never mind.
[33:28.17]She was up on the thing.
[33:29.81]Okay.
[33:30.19]I know what that's like to have a photo that's manipulated.
[33:32.87]Standing on a hill in San Francisco, which should be 2142 in italics.
[33:49.41]And I was at the bottom of the hill.
[33:51.21]And it was literally out in some restaurant in San Francisco where the fucking sidewalks are like 75 degrees.
[33:56.40]And I'm all the way to the end.
[33:57.38]I know what that's like.
[34:06.04]Fucking photo manipulation.
[34:07.80]Cool story.
[34:23.66]Oh, these are other players.
[34:24.99]When you get to the top of... When you get to rank 10 in GTA Online.
[34:40.52]You become this cutscene for all the new players and have a bounty on your head.
[34:44.53]Why didn't they do that?
[34:45.23]Mrs. Leclerc would like to help you get back on your feet.
[34:59.77]I do consulting work.
[35:02.73]I don't judge.
[35:04.11]You want to rob?
[35:05.31]That looks good.
[35:06.39]You want to save innocent folk?
[35:08.81]Do that as well.
[35:10.63]But you need me just as much as I need you.
[35:14.54]I think we all understand each other.
[35:17.28]I kind of miss the silent protagonist.
[35:23.72]Because nobody ever seems to mention it.
[35:26.96]It's just accepted that you never speak.
[35:29.08]You just listen.
[35:29.92]It feels really weird.
[35:49.67]Now on second thought no, I don't miss it.
[35:53.11]I don't I don't really miss it actually I do miss it in some games entirely crazy just yet, and he will help you better than most of his ilk Crips
[36:10.17]Was that a sign of respect back then?
[36:12.31]That's a complete reverse now.
[36:30.29]Alright, where are we headed?
[36:32.03]I get to pick my... Select location for your camp.
[36:34.99]Crips will set this up for you.
[36:36.57]A fee can be paid to move your camp again when you enter free roam.
[36:40.55]Okay.
[36:44.36]Camp.
[36:48.32]View and change camp settings.
[36:49.62]Set camp location.
[36:53.24]Okay.
[36:54.48]So, I just... Small camp.
[36:58.85]Daily fee is charged for camp maintenance.
[37:01.02]A small camp can hold between one to four posse members.
[37:03.90]I can't do the large ones.
[37:04.80]Well, the large one's two dollars.
[37:05.86]Uh, we're gonna go to the bayou.
[37:10.18]I think that's the only thing we can do.
[37:13.93]Yeah.
[37:16.31]Here comes level one.
[37:18.29]This is where we're gonna go.
[37:20.83]Oh, sir.
[37:22.46]While Crips is establishing your camp, perhaps you can go to the station and see the clerk, then head to see Clay Davies.
[37:29.52]He's a horse thief and not a terribly nice one.
[37:32.80]Then meet Crips back at your camp.
[37:35.22]See you shortly, boss.
[37:36.72]Okay.
[37:37.96]Good luck.
[37:44.86]Pressing up can be used to whistle for your horse.
[37:49.21]Yes, just like in the other game.
[37:53.89]My horse is, uh, wait, well, I got... If you don't have any horses, this is your horse.
[38:02.26]Somebody just get five community subs.
[38:05.68]Uh, Lightning Rider, thank you for the five community subs.
[38:13.08]Very generous of you.
[38:14.04]Thank you so much.
[38:21.02]I got re-subbed.
[38:22.04]Oh, there you go.
[38:23.99]You can thank Lightning Rider for that one.
[38:27.50]Is this online?
[38:28.16]Oh, yeah.
[38:28.88]This is kind of like in GTA Online.
[38:32.32]Where there was that initial... You do the first couple little missions and it teaches you how to play again.
[38:39.73]Sort of.
[38:40.03]And then the world opens up.
[38:44.33]So this is the... I got just a kind of shitty horse.
[38:47.74]Gotta go to the post office and find a new horse.
[38:52.72]I forgot how to play.
[38:54.86]So last night we played this for like a couple hours just so I could familiarize myself with Red Dead again because I hadn't played it in a couple weeks.
[39:00.66]I didn't need to do that.
[39:02.96]The game just teaches you how to play again in the first like 40 minutes of this.
[39:13.58]So am I in my own instance right now or are there other players?
[39:19.03]Like, is it possible that I'm gonna see a guy with like a bear head on just like walking down the road throwing fucking grenades at people and stuff?
[39:35.40]You're on your own.
[39:36.00]Okay, well that's interesting.
[39:38.21]So it is just like the first time they tried this in GTA Online.
[39:46.53]Red Dead 2.
[39:47.75]Find a train as soon as possible.
[39:50.33]No, let me get out of this tutorial.
[39:51.69]I don't want to... I'm not going to go train myself.
[39:56.24]Free roam mission givers can be found across the map.
[39:59.66]The closest mission giver will be shown on the radar when you enter free roam.
[40:02.74]So that is a free roam mission.
[40:10.55]Okay.
[40:11.93]Okay.
[40:15.03]There's a rocket-powered stagecoach.
[40:16.97]Well, that sounds fucking fun.
[40:30.81]Hi.
[40:31.81]Everyone you see is a person.
[40:35.24]So this person is just doing a fantastic RP job.
[40:38.90]Anyway, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
[40:41.90]I find your reticence charming.
[40:44.34]Anita.
[41:07.85]A catalog.
[41:09.11]The latest issue just came into this armpit from a land more civilized.
[41:14.95]And if all works out well, my colleagues and I move around these stations as needed.
[41:19.82]And all of us are very discouraged.
[41:23.46]We will all help a fellow sufferer with pertinent information.
[41:28.98]Good afternoon, sir.
[41:32.70]Muppet with scally cap.
[41:38.62]god what I need to know this is it's look it's the same person I think I I'm pretty certain it was just a one-off muppet from one of the random movies no it's not beaker it's like it was like a one-off muppet all right so let's go to the bayou
[42:16.40]I'll find it.
[42:22.72]I think this Muppet was only in like three scenes in the whole movie.
[42:26.48]And that's the only time he was ever used.
[42:30.11]And I think he did talk like this too.
[42:31.87]I think it just was that we made, I don't know.
[42:34.31]I'm subconsciously making characters that are in my brain.
[42:48.59]Great Muppet Cable, oh yeah, that thing, that person got it.
[42:50.69]Did you get it?
[42:54.05]I think it was.
[43:00.99]Is it the taxi driver?
[43:12.42]Yes!
[43:15.94]You got him!
[43:16.84]You got him!
[43:17.64]Alright, we have to watch this right now.
[43:22.90]You got- Yes, you got it!
[43:25.58]Wow!
[43:30.71]You found him.
[43:32.15]It's the taxi driver from The Great Muppet Caper.
[43:40.89]Hold on.
[43:48.30]Where is it?
[43:48.84]Where is it?
[43:49.42]Here he comes.
[43:49.92]Here he comes.
[43:50.50]Where is he?
[43:51.14]He's gonna... Here he comes.
[43:52.32]Gonzo's gonna get him.
[44:19.45]There it is!
[44:20.78]That's very effective.
[44:31.77]That's it.
[44:32.77]That's it.
[44:33.19]That's the only time it was ever used.
[44:46.14]How and why do- I don't know, I just- I remembered, but the best part about it is- Who said that?
[44:54.56]That person deserves an accolade right now.
[45:03.40]Oh, I did.
[45:04.02]Oh no, I forgot, I can't say that.
[45:09.98]That's so funny.
[45:13.62]That was, guys, I'm gonna be completely honest with you, that was going to drive me fucking crazy.
[45:21.54]I was going to sit here for probably, even after the stream is over, in bed, lying down, at dinner.
[45:33.04]It would not have left me.
[45:36.90]Nobody help him next time.
[45:38.06]What, you want me to like suffer?
[45:46.50]The streamer lies down at dinner.
[45:57.36]Moses, his name was the Meme Goblin.
[46:00.18]That was his name?
[46:00.78]Alright, search for the hideout.
[46:21.60]Alright, search.
[46:22.22]Where is it?
[46:22.94]Gang hideouts may appear across free roam.
[46:24.84]Enemies at these hideouts can be looted for cash and other items.
[46:29.08]Okay.
[46:31.37]Something about this music is... Something about this music is weirding me out.
[46:36.61]Let's try to be a little bit stealthy about this.
[46:53.59]He dropped his gun to pull a different one out.
[46:56.39]He was holding a toy.
[46:57.25]Uh oh, a guy's here.
[47:01.37]I better pick up a real gun.
[47:20.16]I'm doing pretty good.
[47:24.41]A whole squad.
[47:25.03]These guys are all in a party together.
[47:26.15]Look at that.
[47:26.53]I... What do I get for doing that?
[47:27.31]1800s stormtroopers.
[47:28.23]Ooh.
[47:28.59]Got another RPer here.
[47:30.23]Roleplayer.
[47:30.49]Take this.
[47:54.96]Alright, the world will be influenced by your honor.
[48:03.10]Spare the banner in order to increase your honor or kill them to lower it.
[48:09.21]I don't have my mic plugged in, so I am just like the silent protagonist.
[48:16.23]No, I'm gonna spare him.
[48:20.59]The Muppet taxi driver is a good guy, okay?
[48:27.80]Yes, I did try to punch him in the face, so.
[48:37.37]You've just received a treasure map.
[48:39.77]Hold to open your satchel and select the treasure map.
[48:44.05]Are we going on a treasure hunt?
[48:47.69]Okay.
[48:51.12]No, he stole your rifle.
[48:52.28]I got my rifle, I'm fine.
[48:54.64]Search this area.
[48:57.17]Here.
[48:58.47]Okay.
[49:00.01]For the treasure.
[49:02.49]I'm gonna assume this is how you make money in this game.
[49:06.33]That would make some sense, right?
[49:14.64]I'm online now, man, so money is valuable.
[49:17.58]Items are valuable.
[49:23.06]Where did this guy go?
[49:23.74]Down here?
[49:29.71]That was a real person.
[49:33.06]Alright.
[49:33.49]Sure see her.
[49:33.83]Get the treasure.
[49:34.33]Let's get back on the horse.
[49:44.12]I have to go up here.
[49:46.12]Oh, by the way, it's been nearly 50 minutes so far streaming, and I have not fallen off the horse once.
[49:51.77]So... That's a new record.
[49:55.13]It actually might be.
[49:57.17]Anybody know?
[49:58.19]If that's, like, actually a new record of not smashing into a tree or a rock after 30, 40, 50 straight minutes?
[50:03.35]Emote!
[50:22.63]Emote wheel.
[50:26.55]Oh my god.
[50:37.17]Search the area.
[50:37.81]So when does this actually come out?
[50:40.17]It's currently in beta, right?
[50:43.55]When does this actually release, for real?
[50:47.60]Not like, oh, open the beta!
[50:50.45]Is this closing in a couple of days?
[50:52.81]And then coming back a month later or something?
[51:01.27]It's always going to be a beta.
[51:02.71]Wait, I'm gonna emote on this guy.
[51:06.05]I'm gonna emote all up in this guy's face.
[51:10.91]I can't go- oops.
[51:14.65]I didn't fall off the horse, that doesn't count.
[51:20.34]So that, oh, it's R?
[51:21.38]That's, that's a, that's range.
[51:23.70]No!
[51:24.52]Come on, man.
[51:27.48]That is a really weird way to do that.
[51:29.74]So, it's, you have to lock on to somebody.
[51:31.66]R2, L, L, R1.
[51:32.18]R1 again for the wheel.
[51:34.22]Wave.
[51:40.44]Wave.
[52:01.66]No, he's not listening.
[52:07.94]R1, R2, square R1, then press R2.
[52:11.50]Kind of running out of buttons on the controller, it seems.
[52:13.54]Yeah, it's L2, R1, and then R1 if you want to change something.
[52:22.17]So it's L2... L2, R1, triangle, or... Let's find that treasure.
[52:33.33]It's an eagle eye.
[52:34.05]Let's get off the horse.
[52:38.49]Well, I don't even... Why would I need to use eagle eye?
[52:40.37]Here it is.
[52:40.71]There's gonna be money in here, right?
[52:51.24]There's a brick.
[52:54.98]Ability card voucher.
[52:58.38]What?
[52:58.76]Gold bars can be used to purchase or unlock certain items early.
[53:02.50]Once you own 100 gold nuggets, these will automatically turn into a gold bar.
[53:06.76]Shop items become unlocked as your rank increases.
[53:08.40]You can see your rank unlocks and... What?
[53:17.20]Cash can be used to purchase a range of products and services.
[53:22.26]So there's a current... There's an in-game currency and then a currency.
[53:26.31]So there's money and then...
[53:29.70]Like MOBA gems.
[53:33.06]You've discovered an ability card coupon that can be redeemed to acquire your first ability card.
[53:40.81]They can be purchased and equipped to offer certain boosts in combat situations.
[53:46.41]Uh... Triangle is the ability loadout.
[53:49.23]Uh... Select to equip an active ability card in this slot.
[53:58.69]Okay.
[54:01.06]So this is my Deadeye abilities.
[54:04.47]While Deadeye is active, you slowly regenerate health.
[54:08.47]Okay.
[54:09.63]While Deadeye is active, you and your team members deal a little bit more damage.
[54:15.19]If more than one member of your team has this ability active, the effects do not stack.
[54:21.86]You can paint targets onto enemies.
[54:25.70]I mean, that's... That's pretty good.
[54:31.04]Yeah, taking this one.
[54:36.72]Paint it black.
[54:39.50]You can upgrade it.
[54:40.70]It has its own experience.
[54:46.33]That's odd.
[54:48.85]Okay.
[54:51.09]That's just normal Deadeye.
[54:53.51]I like the normal Deadeye.
[55:01.36]You now have a Deadeye card.
[55:03.02]When aiming, press R3 to enter Deadeye.
[55:06.59]And use the card's effects.
[55:07.59]Some cards require a weapon to be equipped.
[55:10.11]Yeah.
[55:11.11]Now that would make sense.
[55:15.03]Almost fell, but it didn't.
[55:24.27]Opens treasure chest.
[55:25.23]Cool.
[55:25.63]Four dollars.
[55:26.27]So that's a story mission.
[55:32.83]So what's considered a lot of money in Red Dead Online?
[55:35.33]100 bucks?
[55:36.92]50 bucks?
[55:47.50]50 dollars?
[55:50.96]No, no, no.
[55:51.54]Forget about the guy that already broke into the game's data files and gave himself, like, 50 trillion dollars.
[55:56.81]I'm talking about, like, for real.
[55:59.41]For real video game, in-game currency-wise.
[56:06.55]Is it the cost of the game?
[56:07.49]$59.99?
[56:08.21]Well, that would be fun.
[56:17.78]If it was $60, and that was, like, expensive...
[56:25.04]Some of the horses go for 60 gold bars, which is... That's 600.
[56:30.80]Or 6... What's the nugget to bar conversion?
[56:36.30]Is it 101 or 1001?
[56:37.34]Is it 101?
[56:37.52]101.
[56:37.54]Don't... We're good.
[56:55.67]$4 is probably a steak dinner.
[57:01.24]Clay Davies is far away, ain't he?
[57:09.94]Jesus, Jerma, if you don't know the Nugget to Bar conversion, you will never make it to the finals.
[57:17.01]I'll make it to the finals just based on my pure skill shot.
[57:27.35]I don't need to, look, I don't need to understand.
[57:30.76]I just need to do.
[57:35.04]Right?
[57:38.40]I don't, okay, if you want to take the basketball, um, or baseball, sports thing, right?
[57:44.24]I don't even need to know how the game works.
[57:48.31]The goal is put that ball into the basket.
[57:52.25]And just don't cross this line when you do it.
[57:55.71]Okay?
[57:57.04]If I can get a swish every single fucking time, no matter what happens, that's all I need to know.
[58:02.28]And I could get that $50 million contract just based on getting the ball in the hoop, even if I don't even know how to play the game.
[58:12.03]Start matchmaking for other players?
[58:17.31]Um... I guess.
[58:24.59]I guess we're gonna find players.
[58:33.13]Is this the same streamer that made kids toys while eating pizza?
[58:36.95]Yep.
[58:41.01]Game start.
[58:41.67]Players one out of one.
[58:47.18]Harley suggested you go to see Clay Davies, a horse thief, to learn the ins and outs of the horse rustling trade.
[58:53.63]Alright, I guess I'm just going to ready up.
[58:55.29]Weapon loadout.
[59:02.33]Alright.
[59:05.42]Honor among horse thieves.
[59:10.21]I'm Clay Davies.
[59:11.73]This is my brother, Clive.
[59:13.63]Clive and Clay.
[59:15.37]Maybe you two would get along better.
[59:17.47]Maybe not.
[59:18.53]Somebody already wanted to skip it.
[59:19.89]What?
[59:20.77]Skip the cutscene?
[59:22.41]So, there's a gang of ne'er-do-wells.
[59:25.06]They are a bunch of degenerates.
[59:27.70]Not good people.
[59:29.14]They're out in Rhodes with a bunch of horses they stole off of me.
[59:32.94]I want to see.
[59:33.36]I want to know what happens.
[59:34.26]Well, that's a lie, but they stole them off a fella I was going to steal them off of.
[59:38.06]Somebody in the party is just like, I don't give a shit about any of this.
[59:42.70]I just want to drop dynamite in the middle of the team right when we start the mission.
[59:46.38]One out of four.
[59:48.48]Red Dead players have ADHD.
[59:50.03]Sorry, it's probably three out of four.
[60:08.70]Oh, I do so enjoy these conversations.
[60:11.88]Because guess what?
[60:13.18]I have it.
[60:13.76]And if you think that that guy has it, that's at least two out of four.
[60:16.82]At least.
[60:18.13]All right, so... Go to the mill.
[60:30.99]Take it back to the horse thieves at Rhodes and bring it to him at St.
[60:34.00]Dennis.
[60:35.14]Well, this is the squad, huh?
[60:42.25]This already feels like it should... Wait, what?
[60:45.97]I can... I can... Is this going to hurt him?
[60:51.05]Can I... I can jump on his horse.
[61:02.36]Okay.
[61:06.40]That's interesting.
[61:08.08]Alright.
[61:08.88]That was actually kind of cool.
[61:10.14]I wonder how fast you can go and do that.
[61:14.82]Alright, speed up, get us up there so I can- I wanna get to the first place.
[61:19.20]I wanna live vicariously through the person in first place by jumping on their horse.
[61:29.35]How do I emote?
[61:31.77]Alright, we need to steal a horse.
[61:36.95]Am I slowing the horse down?
[61:39.01]I probably am.
[61:41.75]Alright, so we get a steel horse.
[61:42.99]Uh, this guy, this guy is just kind of running in.
[61:51.49]How did that no- what?
[61:54.93]How did that horse no- oh god, you just already did that, really?
[62:03.92]Oh my god.
[62:07.54]No, I want to shoot this guy.
[62:08.70]Give him cover.
[62:15.78]That's exactly what I thought it was gonna be.
[62:21.06]This is the first mission, too.
[62:27.52]Alright, we gotta get a horse.
[62:28.42]Did I shoot the horse?
[62:38.47]Alright, I need to- Wait, which horse am I- I'm in here first!
[62:40.61]Red!
[62:40.89]No!
[62:41.45]Blue!
[62:41.75]No, no, no, no!
[62:42.25]Which one do I want?
[62:43.55]This one!
[62:50.64]Let's go!
[62:52.28]I already didn't get one.
[62:54.82]Hold on, how did he not get one?
[62:57.14]Who didn't get a horse yet?
[62:58.20]Which one of my crew members?
[63:04.45]Why are we not together?
[63:06.43]Somebody died.
[63:07.95]Who died?
[63:14.93]What is this?
[63:15.33]This guy didn't have a horse yet.
[63:16.87]Go get a horse!
[63:20.37]No, I don't want that person- I have to help, because that- somebody needs to go get their horse.
[63:27.20]Oh well.
[63:29.94]What?
[63:31.72]The fuck was that?
[63:32.76]Alright, take the horse to the stable.
[63:48.52]Alright.
[63:51.60]I gotta get real close.
[63:57.59]Whoa!
[63:58.61]Are we waiting for the last person?
[64:05.21]Um, excuse me.
[64:06.59]Excuse me.
[64:12.68]What?
[64:13.98]Where's our last guy?
[64:16.00]What's he doing all the way over there?
[64:19.94]That guy, we, everyone shot that guy.
[64:21.42]Four hats came out of that guy.
[64:23.50]He disappeared and he turned to the hats.
[64:34.49]Um, why are we standing here?
[64:38.17]Is there a reason for this?
[64:43.23]Why can I not shoot?
[64:46.03]Okay, that was really weird.
[64:48.53]Leave him.
[64:48.89]Don't we have to finish the mission together?
[64:57.27]You fucking asshole!
[64:59.63]You dick!
[65:13.48]That doesn't count.
[65:14.22]I was intentionally sabotaged.
[65:22.65]I ran into him.
[65:24.05]No, he stopped in the middle of the road.
[65:25.75]He just went... He did that on purpose.
[65:31.53]He was trying to... He was making like a compilation video.
[65:35.16]Now I'm in it.
[65:36.36]I get to be in it now.
[65:46.32]The funniest part about this, is this still a guy that just rode down there to the west?
[65:53.37]I don't think that guy knows what's going on.
[65:56.91]Did that person's horse die?
[66:07.06]Don't stop short again.
[66:16.56]Alright, I got a horse.
[66:22.79]What a mess.
[66:26.85]Some kind of suicide squad.
[66:36.56]I got to rank three.
[66:39.84]Well, well, well.
[66:41.16]Horley was right about you.
[66:43.22]Dead right.
[66:44.02]Ain't that dandy?
[66:46.00]The good thing about this, I'm happy that we all don't have to complete it.
[66:48.55]Just, we can't have two people die.
[66:52.05]That guy just took off into the wilderness and started hunting.
[66:54.27]Nice meeting you.
[67:09.88]You know what?
[67:10.42]Hold on, boy.
[67:12.40]I call him boy because I'm older.
[67:14.50]30 minutes.
[67:15.30]He went black.
[67:17.38]Let's give our friend here back the horse.
[67:19.96]Hey, thanks.
[67:20.40]It's yours.
[67:21.52]A sign of faith in future business.
[67:24.18]If you want to buy any extras or sundries for the animal, head inside.
[67:28.40]They've got a lot available.
[67:30.40]What's a sundry?
[67:32.01]See you soon.
[67:33.73]Come on, Clive.
[67:42.38]face fuck what the fuck all right so services good morning to you rename the horse I can't horse insurance
[68:09.93]I guess just get it.
[68:12.55]Rename horse.
[68:19.74]How about... It can't be Phil.
[68:27.78]It's gotta be something better than that.
[68:29.18]How about...
[68:59.97]I just used all my money.
[69:06.59]That was $7.50.
[69:08.13]I forgot I was online.
[69:16.88]This is just something I just do in the regular game.
[69:19.16]I just buy it every time because I have a whole ton of money.
[69:21.30]Alright, whatever.
[69:27.46]Empty slot.
[69:30.23]I guess this is just free.
[69:33.05]Improved.
[69:35.05]It's just stock.
[69:37.71]Saddle voucher.
[69:39.69]Alright.
[69:40.11]Saddle bags.
[69:40.97]This is going to cost money, isn't it?
[69:42.04]Yeah, it's 80 bucks.
[69:48.90]Look at this shit.
[69:50.36]$22.
[69:51.14]Not enough.
[69:51.60]Buy now with one gold.
[69:57.89]This shit isn't even worth it.
[70:04.25]Drain rate.
[70:06.77]All you're paying for is to get that 10% drain rate.
[70:14.98]You can't even see that from more than 3 or 4 feet away.
[70:21.58]So if you want to pay for a drain rate decrease, buy 100 gold packs on the... No.
[70:30.33]Absolutely not.
[70:37.81]Uh, we're just gonna do... We're just gonna do default.
[70:43.04]Just buy the super horse.
[70:44.66]21?
[70:47.40]No.
[70:48.20]That's too much money.
[70:52.64]Core drain?
[70:53.60]Oh, whatever.
[70:54.08]I don't think I can do anything about the... This is probably gonna cost money too.
[70:57.75]Yep.
[70:58.77]No, I have to keep... I just do default.
[71:00.61]I can't do anything interesting.
[71:01.69]Because I need to buy a gun or something.
[71:08.79]Which version of the game is this?
[71:09.91]This is the Special Edition.
[71:12.61]I didn't buy the Ultimate Edition because I didn't think it was worth it.
[71:16.03]I didn't think it was... Oh, whatever, I'll just get the... I'll get the one that you shouldn't buy, the one in the middle.
[71:20.72]And I couldn't play yesterday.
[71:23.40]And I got, like, a cool horse in the main game.
[71:28.44]Alright, that's good.
[71:32.71]Am I in the open world now?
[71:36.14]See, I got the cool one.
[71:36.76]Knowing Rockstar, they'll be flying horses soon.
[71:56.53]Yeah, if you want, look, if you want to play Red Dead Redemption, and you want to play it at its very pure core, you've got to play within the next, I would say, within the next couple months.
[72:06.55]Because after a year of content updates, it's going to feel like steampunk in this game.
[72:13.14]It'll be like astronaut helmets, there'll be spaceships and shit.
[72:18.95]Extra stalls can be purchased in the stable.
[72:20.51]These allow you to buy and manage additional horses, right.
[72:28.00]If you want the real Red Dead Redemption 2 online experience... I would get involved in the next couple months.
[72:37.93]Before the guy that has $500,000... That just sends horses with, like, C4 attached to, like, blow up everybody standing in free roam.
[72:47.71]That doesn't exist right now.
[72:51.51]It will.
[72:51.83]It's gonna happen.
[72:56.94]Once people are able to battlefield people in this game... Now I'm just shilling for Red Dead On... No, no!
[73:08.27]I'm telling you to play it now!
[73:10.03]Don't play it later.
[73:11.22]Guess I am telling you to buy it, am I?
[73:14.52]Yeah, I guess I am saying that.
[73:25.71]Alright, uh, well... Okay, for a second I was like, who the fuck is Sean and why are they in my game?
[73:31.56]Uh, do you really need me to tell you to buy Red Dead Redemption 2?
[73:38.52]Do I have to say that?
[73:40.38]Isn't it very obvious that this game's worth playing?
[73:44.08]I gotta be careful with what I say about one of the best open world games probably to come out in five to ten years.
[73:50.32]No, I gotta be careful!
[73:54.20]Anyway, I've got everything set up.
[73:57.34]Well, what we have so far, the place is pretty nice.
[74:02.09]Not really.
[74:03.19]I think you did a good job for you.
[74:05.47]I'll earn my keep.
[74:07.39]You get too old to fight.
[74:08.61]What choice have you got?
[74:09.73]It's either work or beg.
[74:12.75]I'd rather work.
[74:14.81]It's hardly a high bar there.
[74:17.33]Now, he wants you to come down and meet him in Blackwater when you get a chance.
[74:21.87]I think he might have some work for you.
[74:24.67]Oh, and while you're out on your travels, you may see some folk with employment opportunities.
[74:31.80]Good folk, bad folk.
[74:33.60]Well, should I?
[74:34.94]You decide if you want to purchase something or not.
[74:37.32]Up to you if you listen to him.
[74:40.56]I will always tell you what I don't like.
[74:41.93]I used to like that kind of stuff.
[74:45.05]This guy's beard is just frozen boogers.
[74:49.73]That's all it is.
[74:52.07]He's never wiped it off.
[74:55.50]In probably two or three decades.
[75:06.37]General stores and tailors for supplies and clothing.
[75:08.25]Here you go.
[75:08.69]Welcome to GTA.
[75:10.41]I mean, Red Dead Online.
[75:14.48]On Smith's cell, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[75:16.54]Find and accept free roam missions from various characters like this guy.
[75:20.30]Or this guy.
[75:22.53]Or counter a rival player's mission for your own reward.
[75:25.35]No, really?
[75:28.19]Hold on, what?
[75:30.63]Did they just say please grief everybody that's playing the game?
[75:43.74]Hey, if somebody's trying to do a mission, fuck them up intentionally by flying a fucking flying horse into the train in front of their mission.
[75:50.54]You'll get rewarded for it.
[75:53.16]Well, I guess the whole game is about being like an outlaw, so that isn't out of the ordinary.
[76:01.12]Player menu is used to set and receive invites.
[76:06.94]Okay, I can either click join.
[76:08.66]Ooh, I got a trophy.
[76:11.06]View, join, or invite players.
[76:14.92]No, no MLC stuff is not playing this game Let's see Yes friends, yeah, I won So I guess there's join view and invite to quick join join a series or story, but wait a minute.
[76:41.75]Not yet.
[76:42.05]Wait a minute.
[76:42.57]Oh
[76:44.51]The camp's white flag is raised, protecting you from other players.
[76:47.04]Focus on the flag or use the player menu to lower it.
[76:51.54]The camp's white flag is raised.
[76:54.74]So that means nobody can come in here?
[76:56.02]So this is where you're safe.
[76:59.88]As long as I have the flag raised.
[77:02.85]Oh, there.
[77:03.17]Okay, over here.
[77:07.23]Lower the flag.
[77:09.29]Lower the flag!
[77:12.55]Let them come.
[77:15.07]Some items can be purchased through the catalog.
[77:17.43]You have a new person.
[77:21.42]That is, uh-oh.
[77:22.08]Alright, let's open the handheld menu.
[77:33.23]Hunting and fishing horses.
[77:34.51]So this is just the web.
[77:35.73]Okay.
[77:36.25]I can just buy this from here.
[77:37.39]That's cool.
[77:43.15]How much is a bow?
[77:47.59]$124.
[77:47.61]$724?
[77:47.71]Why is it so... How much higher than that?
[77:59.78]$900.
[77:59.94]Okay.
[78:05.36]Well... I used to do this when I was a kid.
[78:10.81]I was never gonna get any of it.
[78:12.87]But this is the equivalent of what I used to do.
[78:14.57]I used to... Okay, there used to be a...
[78:17.61]like a Macy's catalog, or like a JCPenney catalog would come in, and there'd be a huge toy section.
[78:25.82]And I would just go through, and I would just circle all the toys that I ever wanted.
[78:33.60]That's all I can do.
[78:35.54]Oh, goddammit.
[78:36.65]Hold on.
[78:45.53]How do I, like, turn that off?
[78:57.92]This is not going to stop.
[79:00.78]Notification settings.
[79:08.68]It's just going.
[79:10.17]I thought I already had that set.
[79:14.05]Notifications.
[79:19.69]Notification settings.
[79:20.57]I thought I already had it off.
[79:21.65]Yeah, pop-up notifications.
[79:24.22]No, no, just disable.
[79:26.22]No notifications, absolutely none of them at all.
[79:31.56]I think I got it.
[79:36.40]Are we good?
[79:37.32]I think so.
[79:38.98]We're good.
[79:39.88]Alright, we're back.
[79:44.84]Okay, so let's just take a look.
[79:53.94]I should probably put this back up, shouldn't I?
[79:55.94]That's the wrong button.
[79:58.48]And I don't want to run out of ammo in this game.
[80:00.10]Raise it!
[80:00.60]Raise it!
[80:02.40]So, I can't wait to get chased by somebody and then stand behind here and just point and be like, Ha ha ha!
[80:07.67]You can't get me!
[80:09.79]Like the guy that drives over the Mexican border at the end of the action movie.
[80:14.53]And there's a confrontation between the cop and the bad guy, and like, I can't do anything about ya!
[80:21.30]I can't wait to have one of those scenarios.
[80:29.83]One more.
[80:30.29]Give me one more.
[80:32.75]Continue playing to access your bonus content.
[80:36.21]You made that joke.
[80:37.73]When?
[80:39.92]When?
[80:40.30]What was the scenario?
[80:46.54]You already made- But when?
[80:47.62]When did I make the reference?
[80:49.82]Does anyone remember what game it was?
[81:00.89]50... 50,000.
[81:04.23]Oh, okay.
[81:08.09]All right.
[81:08.51]First, I thought somebody just gave $50,000 to the stream.
[81:14.09]And I was like, no, they didn't.
[81:15.19]I was like, no, fucking what?
[81:19.76]Everybody freaked the fuck out.
[81:20.96]I see 50K, 50K.
[81:22.38]I'm like, no, what happened to 50,000?
[81:23.82]What happened?
[81:24.46]What happened to it?
[81:29.47]No, it's just fucking seagulls.
[81:32.71]It's just a bot that was there.
[81:33.99]Alright, let's go do a mission.
[81:38.71]Let's go, I'm gonna, wait, uh... Don't dream so high, man.
[81:45.08]I'm not, no, I just freaked out for a second.
[81:48.32]Okay.
[81:49.70]There are almost 4,000 people here, right?
[81:51.82]When, like, the chat blows up like that, and I just see 50k, 50k, and a ton of, like, fucking pogchamps...
[81:58.41]Is this a player?
[82:01.85]No.
[82:04.39]I mean, what am I supposed to think?
[82:07.99]I'm like, 50,000 what?
[82:10.58]And then my brain said, wait, 50?
[82:12.24]Everyone's freaking out.
[82:18.24]You didn't think I was gonna do it!
[82:19.68]You didn't think I was gonna be able to get it, but I got it.
[82:21.28]This is gonna impede me.
[82:30.75]I need to just get into, like, a lobby.
[82:35.21]Have I used any microtransactions?
[82:36.65]No, not yet.
[82:37.13]I just want to jump over this.
[82:45.02]No.
[82:45.46]No, I didn't do it.
[82:46.28]Did I do it?
[82:49.26]I did.
[82:51.89]Yeah, I did.
[82:53.41]Oops.
[82:53.89]No, we're fine.
[82:57.42]Not yet.
[82:58.34]Well, no, not yet as in no, not ever.
[83:01.02]I should have been more clear.
[83:08.49]I'm not gonna buy gold bars.
[83:10.41]If I was gonna spend a hundred dollars in this game and buy gold bars... I would, no, I would just... I would go take that money to the casino and just put it on double zero.
[83:26.08]Because, hey, guess what?
[83:27.46]There's a small chance that I just made, like, 35 fucking hundred dollars.
[83:31.56]Oh, there are players here.
[83:39.43]Really?
[83:39.77]Okay.
[83:42.33]I see the little blips on the map.
[83:43.41]Where are they?
[83:45.89]Are they only on the mini-map, or are they on the large map?
[83:48.59]Ooh, okay, hold on.
[83:49.13]There's a person here.
[83:51.32]Okay.
[83:51.44]Okay.
[83:57.85]Kill them.
[83:58.33]No.
[84:00.14]I'm not going to start the never-ending cycle of Rockstar Online game insanity.
[84:05.62]If I shoot this guy, it will never end.
[84:09.22]Because even if I leave, I'm going to shoot this guy, and then I'm going to leave.
[84:13.99]This guy's going to be angry, and he's going to shoot the guy that's next to him, down there.
[84:17.07]If that guy's going to get angry and shoot the guy that spawns next to him, it's never going to end the cycle.
[84:21.60]It stops here.
[84:22.44]I'm not doing it.
[84:49.74]What was that?
[84:57.02]How do I do the mission?
[85:03.75]I just started the cycle, and now the cycle's never gonna break.
[85:06.77]Where's this mission?
[85:21.67]And you see?
[85:25.48]I shot that guy.
[85:26.26]That guy shot somebody else.
[85:29.36]And then that person went into another game.
[85:31.74]Fuck this!
[85:32.30]And shot somebody else.
[85:35.92]And then eventually it kept going.
[85:39.33]And... Eventually they got to a point where somebody shot the server.
[85:48.50]Uh... Alright.
[86:00.91]Just go to free roam if I can even get in.
[86:07.67]Yeah, somebody in game ran around and they found the box.
[86:12.22]That's plugged in.
[86:15.56]That's the way that they can have all the servers open.
[86:17.90]That guy just shot the fucking router in the game.
[86:30.92]this dead worked but what if I did just get banned imagine that that's the fault on rockstar for putting the router in the game true talk is this really good I don't I don't know I didn't really get to play it
[87:01.76]Oh god, really?
[87:04.82]Due to a fault on Rockstar Games Services.
[87:11.05]What does that code mean?
[87:12.13]Hold on, is it just off?
[87:26.55]Banned?
[87:27.69]Banned.
[87:28.55]No, I'm not banned.
[87:29.97]The server, somebody fucking unplugged the server in Rhodes Ranch.
[87:38.03]Uh, let's see.
[87:42.50]Oh, we got a fix for it, apparently.
[87:43.94]There's an easy fix for this problem.
[87:52.18]Uh...
[87:56.50]Back out of the menu by pressing the button and attempt to relaunch Red Dead Online.
[88:01.00]Quit out of Red Dead and reboot the game.
[88:04.36]Okay.
[88:06.55]So I have to reboot the game.
[88:09.55]Hopefully that fixes it.
[88:13.03]Wait an hour or two.
[88:14.29]No, I'm not going to wait an hour or two.
[88:18.47]See, I fucking told you.
[88:21.15]I shot that guy and it started a cycle of hatred...
[88:26.40]And eventually it got disconnected.
[88:28.80]I got disconnected somehow.
[88:40.55]All right, I'm gonna restart the game.
[88:43.01]See if it works.
[88:48.38]Somebody tries to find the root of the problem and I was the root of the problem.
[89:07.49]That guy was the server.
[89:10.41]Which you guys don't understand.
[89:12.95]When I say, oh, somebody must have shot the server in the game, that's what I did.
[89:18.31]NPCs in this game are, it's a network.
[89:22.95]Certain NPCs need to be left completely untouched.
[89:26.53]Because they're the ones that are directly, they're making the whole thing work.
[89:41.08]Let's try it again.
[89:41.54]Here we go.
[89:43.19]Are we gonna get... Same error.
[89:46.59]That was the test.
[89:47.31]You failed.
[89:48.67]Damn it.
[89:50.85]And I said it too.
[89:52.03]I said, no, it's gonna cause a cycle of bullshit and hatred.
[89:56.37]And it's gonna disconnect people.
[89:57.37]People are gonna get angry, disconnect from the game.
[89:58.95]And then, no, fuck this game.
[89:59.77]I'm not playing this game ever again.
[90:19.81]Do I like these loading screens more compared to GTA V?
[90:23.47]Yeah, probably.
[90:26.21]Mainly because the GTA V one was a static image that just changed to... It was like the same three images.
[90:32.52]I mean, these are also the same few images, but... It's a little more muted.
[90:42.26]And I don't know if this is going to work.
[90:44.90]Ooh!
[90:45.34]Okay.
[90:56.81]Server booting backup initiated.
[91:02.12]Come on.
[91:02.72]Let me back in.
[91:11.02]Continue playing.
[91:11.60]Got it.
[91:12.14]Eat.
[91:13.36]Where the hell am I?
[91:20.27]See, I think you're good.
[91:21.89]A Rockstar dev definitely just was like, the cycle ends here, and just disconnected.
[91:26.60]He ripped out all the cords, and then everybody now has to start fresh.
[91:38.71]There's my horse.
[91:40.09]I want to go back over to that mission.
[91:44.39]Where the hell am I?
[91:45.61]Eats grass.
[91:46.39]Well, what if I was hungry?
[91:50.78]Alright, Sean.
[91:52.58]Let's go.
[91:53.70]What was that?
[92:00.90]Oh.
[92:01.00]I thought it was a player.
[92:02.16]It was a player.
[92:02.72]I just saw a name.
[92:09.67]There was a name there.
[92:10.31]That's the crocodile's... Who the fuck is talking?
[92:23.91]Oh, that's me going... Yeah!
[92:25.37]Alright, so now I'm gonna be a good guy.
[92:43.66]Why am I having to... I'm an unintentional bully.
[92:46.70]I don't mean to do that.
[92:47.98]I don't... I didn't want to do that.
[93:01.11]No, this is nice.
[93:01.73]I like how this town is lit up at night.
[93:02.95]Alright, so we got... We got the barbershop.
[93:09.29]Uh, what do you think?
[93:17.24]I'll tell you what I think.
[93:18.10]Let's see.
[93:21.30]Nice haircut!
[93:25.06]Is this your horse?
[93:28.36]What is your horse?
[93:34.32]Don't crash the server.
[93:35.22]You're gonna crash the server!
[93:40.96]The cycle... The cycle never ends.
[93:44.68]I told you guys, that person did the same thing I did.
[93:48.31]The same exact thing.
[93:50.73]And it starts over again.
[93:52.87]Rockstar, unplug it again.
[93:54.19]We need to start over.
[93:59.81]And I will continue to restart and re-imagine and originate the human species until you learn to get along.
[94:10.16]That's it, we don't.
[94:10.74]We're in like a fucking weird post-apocalyptic movie.
[94:20.65]Where's my horse?
[94:21.15]Can my horse be stolen or taken or killed or something?
[94:27.06]I think they're coming after me.
[94:30.03]This person, look, this person's just murdering people.
[94:33.37]See, I did it once and broke the server.
[94:35.06]But now, it's time to get a little bit of revenge here, I think.
[94:40.10]The cycle repeats.
[94:41.20]The cycle repeats.
[94:42.31]The cycle repeats.
[95:03.93]Alright, I got my revenge, I gotta get out of here.
[95:10.51]It's time to go do a mission.
[95:12.93]With a bunch of friends!
[95:16.09]Whoop!
[95:16.87]Okay.
[95:19.83]So... This guy right here.
[95:29.72]Except Caravan Escort.
[95:31.46]How do I turn off voice chat?
[95:32.96]Showdown.
[95:33.34]Is somebody ringing a bell?
[95:35.18]It's in the player menu.
[95:58.82]Who's bringing the thing?
[95:59.66]Uh, that's not the player menu.
[96:02.18]Online options.
[96:04.16]Voice chat.
[96:04.38]No one.
[96:04.52]I can't.
[96:04.74]Friends only.
[96:05.08]Walk styles.
[96:05.45]Crazy.
[96:05.61]Alright, now we're good.
[96:06.25]I'll take it.
[96:29.03]Nope.
[96:29.57]Got nothing for you, sunshine.
[96:31.41]Not what?
[96:31.77]Oh, so bored.
[96:33.95]It's like being trapped in a picture frame.
[96:35.91]Increase your chance of success by accepting free roam missions.
[96:39.24]Some job that needs doing.
[96:41.60]Whoever they are.
[96:42.98]Not that I give a damn anymore.
[96:45.42]Oh, so bored.
[96:47.52]It's like being trapped in a picture frame.
[96:48.86]I'm not allowed to do this?
[96:49.74]I'm not cool enough?
[96:50.62]I don't have a big enough... Some job that needs doing.
[96:55.08]Whoever they are.
[96:56.46]Not that I give a damn anymore.
[96:58.54]I need some people online.
[97:01.92]Except Supply Wagon.
[97:04.62]What is he doing?
[97:05.18]Oh, okay.
[97:12.39]I'm not big enough.
[97:14.75]Alright.
[97:16.41]Does this mean that other people are going to be in this game?
[97:25.24]Deliver the supplies to Rhodes General Store.
[97:27.34]Take the supplies to the drop-off within the time limit to earn the full reward.
[97:34.16]So people are gonna sabotage me here.
[97:37.12]I just gotta go.
[97:37.81]Maybe people aren't paying that much attention.
[97:39.17]I just gotta bring the wagon.
[97:50.67]And if anybody comes near me, rival players can attack the supplies.
[97:57.60]Right.
[97:58.02]No, this is great.
[97:59.24]Okay, well, I know what you're doing down there.
[98:02.85]You just got the little pop-up window.
[98:07.57]Jerma is delivering supplies!
[98:12.89]You should probably stop him.
[98:13.83]Maybe they're too preoccupied.
[98:16.77]Hello, sir.
[98:22.97]Maybe I'll just get this without any issue at all, and I'll get the full one gold bar reward.
[98:33.16]Hey, this is great.
[98:33.84]Look at this.
[98:37.29]I just get to drive it for free.
[98:39.85]No one's gonna stop me.
[98:41.11]No one can stop me.
[98:51.85]I won.
[98:57.85]Am I even in a game with anybody anymore?
[99:06.82]What?
[99:17.91]Why can't I shoot?
[99:24.21]Shoot him.
[99:25.55]Shoot the gun.
[99:26.13]What are you fucking doing?
[99:28.53]What?
[99:28.87]I can't shoot that way.
[99:30.26]I can't shoot the gun that way.
[99:35.66]This is not a player.
[99:36.60]Yeah, it's because they probably all get disconnected.
[99:40.30]I need to run.
[99:51.45]Well, I am running.
[99:54.43]There ain't nobody here to stop me.
[100:00.19]I just get whatever I get from completing this.
[100:05.13]I think maybe the servers went down to get it.
[100:06.49]Now I just get all the spoils.
[100:12.96]Let's get this camera angle.
[100:19.34]Are the servers really that dead?
[100:22.02]I... They shouldn't be.
[100:31.06]I'm in an empty server.
[100:32.28]Well, I'll go to a new one.
[100:34.90]after I get the full reward.
[100:37.26]Uh-oh.
[100:41.20]Somebody's coming in.
[100:53.55]Wait, am I about to drive right into somebody?
[100:55.03]I gotta be ready for this.
[101:00.98]Are they gonna come straight down the road?
[101:10.01]How far away are they?
[101:12.38]I got it.
[101:13.16]It's right here.
[101:17.38]Enemies can't interact with me when I'm in the drop-off area.
[101:19.50]Alright, we'll get over there.
[101:28.01]Red Dead Redemption Online!
[101:30.61]It's awesome!
[101:40.10]One cent.
[101:42.75]Wow.
[101:44.57]That was exhilarating.
[101:53.49]Here's my experience with Red Dead 2 Online so far.
[101:58.48]Hello?
[101:59.38]Hello?
[102:00.28]Hello?
[102:03.70]Anybody here?
[102:04.52]Anybody here?
[102:05.28]Anybody here?
[102:06.08]Anybody here?
[102:08.99]What's going on here?
[102:09.59]Is somebody playing?
[102:10.01]What's going on here?
[102:10.75]Is somebody playing?
[102:11.31]What's going on here?
[102:11.89]Is somebody playing?
[102:19.17]What's going on here?
[102:26.54]Alright, how do I join like a... I want to join like a different game.
[102:30.84]Alright, join... Free roam.
[102:39.96]You sure you want to join Red Dead Online?
[102:41.50]Yes.
[102:42.88]Just get me in a different session.
[102:57.03]Hopping dimensions.
[103:01.45]I could do the story mission.
[103:02.29]At least matchmaking would probably pull people in, right?
[103:05.01]Remember when Next was an emote?
[103:08.31]Oh yeah, I do.
[103:10.63]Boy, that was a mistake.
[103:25.00]Next.
[103:26.24]God.
[103:28.34]Immediately after uploading that, I was going, I don't know if I should actually put this on.
[103:34.14]And then I left it there for like a year.
[103:42.52]Are we gonna get the error code again?
[103:48.11]No, we're not.
[103:48.89]Alright, so... Here we are.
[103:50.79]Uhhh... There we go!
[104:07.98]Alright, we're good.
[104:09.04]We're good.
[104:09.60]We're... We... They're here.
[104:13.39]But where are they?
[104:14.13]Okay, a lot of people... I'm just in, like, the shitty place.
[104:22.06]There we go.
[104:24.46]Alright, let's just go.
[104:25.44]We're gonna go on a... Now I'm excited.
[104:29.44]Okay, let's do... This is like Strangers.
[104:38.23]Fortnite.
[104:38.49]Fortnite.
[104:42.59]Do you remember the train?
[104:43.41]Oh my god, he has headphones on.
[104:44.99]He can't hear me.
[104:45.95]Do you remember the train?
[104:49.31]Oh my god, he has headphones on.
[104:54.90]I already did this one.
[104:56.22]I don't want to do that one again.
[105:03.52]Play horseshoes?
[105:05.18]I could play horseshoes, couldn't I?
[105:06.40]I wonder if you can play with other people.
[105:09.94]Is this another one of those... And now somebody stops me missions.
[105:21.41]Can you open your house?
[105:31.49]Alright, well let's actually then... let's go here then.
[105:34.97]Where is that yellow marker?
[105:38.65]Over here!
[105:41.73]Well, I just... I think I'm going... Does it tell you if you've been marked?
[105:47.76]Another player has marked your direct location.
[105:49.84]It might, it probably does.
[106:05.66]NPCs, don't worry about them.
[106:07.30]Just leave them be.
[106:16.60]Hey Jeremy, your title says you're playing Red Dead 2 Online.
[106:19.46]Can you update the title?
[106:20.60]I don't want people getting confused.
[106:22.12]Do I have any items for the horse?
[106:29.81]Here, eat an apple.
[106:39.84]Mod that guy.
[106:42.36]No.
[106:42.68]Nobody's getting modded.
[106:49.74]Is this... Whose place is this?
[106:53.42]Is this somebody's camp?
[106:56.09]Whose camp is this?
[106:57.39]I need to investigate.
[106:57.99]Who's here?
[106:58.35]Who lives here?
[107:05.89]Can I do anything in this person's camp?
[107:10.52]Well, the white flag is up, so I can't do anything.
[107:15.39]That's cool.
[107:20.91]Smash the guy's toilet.
[107:28.79]Poop in his tent.
[107:31.43]No, he has the white flag up.
[107:32.67]I can't go to the bathroom on his fucking clothes.
[107:34.87]This is far away.
[107:40.92]Can I get there by going around the, like, riverbank?
[107:43.88]Or do I have to actually go all the way back up here?
[107:49.84]He put ants in his sleeping bag.
[107:53.61]You guys are fucking cruel!
[108:04.25]Poor ants in his sleeping bag!
[108:13.85]I have to go all the way around.
[108:19.73]This horse sucks.
[108:21.79]They really want you to pay- I'm so used to having my $20 horse from the main game.
[108:25.46]I can't believe I actually have to go all the way around.
[108:35.55]God damn it.
[108:40.81]Shit.
[108:49.81]I'm not even near his camp anymore.
[108:51.43]Just take the train.
[109:00.74]Join a deathmatch.
[109:04.96]Is the train even actually available to take?
[109:08.99]Oh, it is.
[109:10.79]Fast travel.
[109:11.51]Holy shit, it is.
[109:12.25]Alright, so I need to go from here to... I need to go to Blackwater.
[109:17.70]Alright, well, I didn't even know you could do that.
[109:19.20]I don't think that fast travel wouldn't really exist in a game like this, but I guess you could take the subway in GTA Online, couldn't you?
[109:31.47]Any plans of doing, uh, online with friends?
[109:33.61]Oh, yeah.
[109:34.39]Definitely.
[109:36.55]Definitely, definitely, definitely.
[109:38.74]But not everybody can play yet.
[109:40.88]I did just want to check it out.
[109:42.92]Because it's currently only allowed...
[109:48.11]Who's that?
[109:50.34]What is this?
[109:52.86]Hideout.
[109:55.94]Hideout?
[109:58.18]Who's hideout?
[110:04.98]Like, another player hideout?
[110:09.64]Or is this just a random, hey, look, a hideout and kill the enemies?
[110:27.15]There's a lot of people here.
[110:28.27]This place is on fire.
[110:31.88]Oh my god, what is that?
[110:35.38]What is that?
[110:35.66]What is this?
[110:36.02]What is that thing?
[110:37.55]Oh, fuck.
[110:38.71]No, no!
[110:39.39]Get away from me!
[110:39.87]I don't have any gu-
[110:56.40]That's apparently the boss.
[111:02.06]Oh, fuck.
[111:04.84]Where is he?
[111:05.32]Where is he?
[111:05.62]Where?
[111:05.88]Where?
[111:06.08]Where?
[111:06.22]Where?
[111:06.36]Where?
[111:06.48]Where?
[111:06.60]Where?
[111:06.76]Where?
[111:06.92]He's over here.
[111:23.77]They give you these little fucking BB guns to start the game.
[111:32.74]I gotta get in there closer.
[111:33.80]I gotta move up.
[111:34.88]Where the fuck is this guy?
[111:45.04]Alright, I'm gonna go down.
[111:52.60]On this rock.
[111:54.94]Got a guy in the front door.
[111:56.90]I think that guy died somehow.
[112:04.46]That guy killed himself somehow.
[112:05.64]Alright.
[112:13.33]There's like one guy left up here.
[112:15.49]And there's the guy with the big hat on inside.
[112:20.36]How are you still alive after I blew up all those tanks?
[112:27.40]Nice dodge.
[112:28.40]Alright, just show your head again, please.
[112:38.11]This looks like a pretty good time waster.
[112:42.57]Yeah, I mean... It depends on how... What the hell...
[112:49.12]I gotta kill these guys too.
[112:59.18]You're still alive.
[113:03.20]He's running.
[113:15.54]Alright.
[113:18.30]Hideout clear.
[113:20.46]Now I have to pick up everybody's body.
[113:25.69]Red Dead Redemption 76.
[113:26.63]Okay, I got ranked 5.
[113:31.81]I unlocked the spleen or a kidney or something.
[113:36.48]Pump action shotgun.
[113:38.68]And a military jacket.
[113:43.73]0% on story missions.
[113:45.43]Leave the bodies as a warning?
[113:46.61]I gotta loot at least some of these.
[113:49.25]Speaking of loot... I mean, there has to be something in here, right?
[113:54.66]Why have a giant hideout boat if you're not gonna have anything there?
[114:05.02]I'm looking for a ladder.
[114:06.94]Can I climb this?
[114:17.05]Loot the dog.
[114:19.91]What do you think the dog has on him?
[114:24.67]Nothing up here at all.
[114:31.36]To lure in the ADHD streamers.
[114:42.36]That's a nice hat.
[114:44.94]Oh, there's a catapult.
[114:46.08]If I pull that thing, it'll shoot a rock directly into that pole, destroying the boat and killing me and anyone else that's on board.
[114:51.62]It's okay.
[114:53.23]Like, a hundred more years, they'll figure it out.
[114:55.81]Or a hundred years in the past, they figured it out.
[114:57.69]I don't know why we'd screw it up like this.
[115:01.18]Nothing here.
[115:13.59]I'll be honest, uh... What the hell was that all about?
[115:18.04]You give me a cool boat to explore and there's just this shitty catapult that doesn't work?
[115:23.86]You spoke so soon.
[115:25.32]Here it is.
[115:25.64]No, never mind.
[115:30.31]This is just explosives.
[115:34.11]Come on, there's nothing in the red Acme chest.
[115:37.29]Like the Roadrunner chest.
[115:38.33]There's nothing over here.
[115:44.84]There's not a backpack that has a propeller on it that I can use?
[115:48.30]No, there's nothing here.
[115:53.36]Fuck it.
[115:53.75]Let's just keep going.
[115:54.39]I mean, that was kinda cool.
[116:03.13]Alright.
[116:04.41]Back to the mission we were doing.
[116:08.41]I don't know where my horse is.
[116:13.83]I think I'm being followed.
[116:30.86]I'm being followed.
[116:36.61]There they are.
[116:36.99]They're there.
[116:37.49]They're in the house.
[116:47.31]You following me?
[116:47.83]What are you doing?
[116:48.34]They're riding around in circles over there.
[117:05.57]I'm ready.
[117:06.29]I'm prepared.
[117:06.73]Hey, how about... Hey, I don't know if you can hear me.
[117:12.01]How about a...
[117:41.65]The server's just high nooned me.
[117:49.18]Oh, he heard me alright, yeah.
[117:56.40]You were saying?
[118:00.10]See, stop killing each other, don't you understand?
[118:02.94]The guy at Rockstar that's ripping it out, the, like, Thanos Rockstar guy.
[118:06.57]No, somebody in town!
[118:12.36]Screamed a bunch of swears and then threw a grenade into the barber shop.
[118:15.36]Rip it out.
[118:16.74]Start over.
[118:32.19]Okay, I'm back.
[118:36.11]And... Well, you gave up.
[118:42.46]All right.
[118:42.78]So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[118:44.62]We're going here.
[118:45.18]I mean, let's give Rockstar a little bit of slack.
[118:54.27]There are probably two to three hundred million people all trying to connect at the same time.
[119:13.14]Two to three hundred, you mean.
[119:16.28]Did I say million?
[119:17.00]Did I add the million?
[119:18.06]I think I added the million.
[119:22.32]I meant that in yen.
[119:24.29]Two to three hundred million yen people.
[119:27.37]Which is like, what, two thousand?
[119:58.06]Alright, let's fast travel over there, and are we actually in a game with people?
[120:01.41]Let me make sure.
[120:04.59]Yes, we are.
[120:05.11]200 million yen is 1.7 million.
[120:12.51]Yeah, so that's 1.7 million people probably trying to play at the same time.
[120:18.90]Fast travel.
[120:23.88]Let's see, how much does it cost?
[120:27.06]Oh, man, that's like 33% of my entire savings.
[120:29.94]I just dumped my 401 out to be able to take a taxi.
[120:58.23]Start riding Let's try these for now
[121:24.37]Beat against up to 32 players across large maps and a series of thrilling game types.
[121:34.49]Want to straight into a race and kick up some dust on horseback.
[121:37.98]Yeah.
[121:39.16]I want to try a race.
[121:46.97]And then we'll go, we'll try, maybe they're just doing Thanos maintenance to it.
[122:00.24]It's not a 2018 multiplayer game without Battle Royale.
[122:08.32]Why don't I never juggle on stream anymore?
[122:12.82]I don't know how to juggle.
[122:24.91]Same.
[122:25.45]Yeah, I don't know how to juggle?
[122:32.37]But why don't I do it anymore?
[122:34.41]Because I don't know how.
[122:35.29]What am I looking at here?
[122:45.76]Do you wish to spectate this session?
[122:48.60]Um... Okay.
[122:53.27]Oh, this is a really bad race we're watching.
[122:57.49]Oh, whoa!
[122:57.85]They crashed!
[122:58.83]A wagon just crashed!
[123:06.27]What's the next one?
[123:06.81]Ooh, alright.
[123:10.00]Uh... Um... Okay.
[123:24.58]Oh, there's the other two people.
[123:27.78]You have to pick up Donkey Kong barrels?
[123:32.76]This guy's shooting.
[123:33.56]Isn't that illegal?
[123:38.53]I thought that was illegal.
[123:39.87]I thought you couldn't use weapons.
[123:48.02]Who's on the other list?
[123:50.36]Is somebody in the train?
[123:56.48]That's a quick way to win a race, is to drive the train there.
[124:06.37]There are 38 people to start this.
[124:12.65]Well, this guy is... I want the person in, like, first place.
[124:15.93]Oh god, he's got headphones on.
[124:27.12]So this is the person in second place.
[124:28.38]Here's the guy in first place.
[124:31.04]Okay.
[124:32.90]Let's see how he does.
[124:34.92]Good luck, guy.
[124:35.46]I hope you... No, you're in sixth.
[124:40.07]Why can I... Wait, this guy's not in first place?
[124:43.05]I just went backwards.
[124:55.12]Did you... Did you just win?
[124:56.61]That person just won.
[124:58.89]They were so hell-bent on shooting the other person that they lost.
[125:04.39]Yeah, here comes the end.
[125:05.15]Alright, let's go.
[125:07.60]My turn.
[125:18.55]So is this just like in GTA Online where in the first one second of it going three, two, one, 14 people crash into each other and fall off the horses and then somebody accidentally gets in first place and they stay in first place the rest of the time?
[125:36.07]This guy's not even doing the race anymore.
[125:37.59]Wait.
[125:45.32]First place!
[125:50.60]I'll take my reward, please.
[125:52.38]Thank you!
[126:05.90]What?
[126:09.65]Okay.
[126:10.61]Uh, proceed.
[126:14.73]Stable.
[126:16.15]I'll be riding with Sean, who sucks.
[126:19.23]Game details.
[126:20.23]Yep.
[126:21.93]I'm... I'm ready.
[126:22.71]Ready up.
[126:31.80]Change outfit?
[126:32.50]I don't have any outfits.
[126:38.06]Hey!
[126:38.22]Oh, I turned off!
[126:38.80]I turned this off!
[126:39.42]Didn't I do that?
[126:40.08]I turned that off?
[126:50.32]Alright, shh, we just gotta pretend we're not here.
[127:08.65]Alright, let's do it.
[127:09.95]Bard's Crossing, point-to-point race across Bard's Crossing.
[127:13.11]I'm ready.
[127:17.24]A heated gaming moment inbound.
[127:21.09]Yep.
[127:25.95]Three!
[127:26.93]Two!
[127:28.07]One!
[127:28.89]Go!
[127:31.85]That's me!
[127:44.32]Three!
[127:45.16]Two!
[127:46.20]One!
[127:46.38]Why am I all the way in the back?
[127:47.24]That's not fair.
[127:54.13]I'm going to get in that first place position.
[127:57.65]I'm at least going to start in the top.
[127:59.08]I'm going to finish in the... It really is Mario Kart.
[128:03.98]I just got a gun.
[128:06.59]First place.
[128:22.01]What oh my god that you have so much help It's not what I thought it was gonna be My horse I gotta be careful slow down let the horse breathe
[128:52.00]Why did I die?
[129:03.15]Whose horse is that?
[129:04.91]Why is it in the way?
[129:06.07]What?
[129:14.00]What's the fucking spawning horse?
[129:16.80]Was that my horse?
[129:24.80]There's just wild horses running around.
[129:28.44]Okay, I need something.
[129:29.24]I don't know what I just got.
[129:34.17]Nothing.
[129:37.57]I'm in the last place right now, but that wasn't my fault.
[129:39.45]I got a horse spawn.
[129:40.61]Somebody dropped a horse banana peel on me.
[129:42.81]That wasn't fair.
[129:50.33]Oh, you gotta collect a barrel to replenish the stamina, right?
[129:58.25]What?
[130:12.23]Does he, like, tap my foot and I died?
[130:21.31]Three green shells.
[130:22.33]Alright, this is where I'm gonna get the lightning bolt.
[130:24.81]See?
[130:25.17]It really is the lightning bolt.
[130:28.03]I actually just picked up the lightning bolt.
[130:29.93]Alright, now I'm gonna get a shotgun.
[130:36.39]I just shrunk everybody by like 60%.
[130:37.63]I'm good.
[130:41.50]Not in last place anymore.
[130:55.55]That person's gone.
[130:56.19]That person's off track completely.
[130:57.33]I gotta get in 8th place.
[131:01.65]What?
[131:05.37]What?
[131:05.69]Is he phased?
[131:06.33]I don't understand.
[131:08.30]He just phased in.
[131:18.82]How come he doesn't go off?
[131:20.43]Why does he not go off?
[131:23.37]Why does he not get affected by that?
[131:25.83]That was ridiculous.
[131:33.88]I get fucking tapped on the toe and I flip off and die.
[131:39.58]My horse spins around in a circle a hundred miles per hour and... What the fuck is happening?
[131:52.63]Hey, I didn't come in last.
[131:55.15]Here comes the finish line.
[132:12.08]I can't come in last place.
[132:14.74]It's alright, the guy that isn't last place right now gave up.
[132:27.10]What was that?
[132:27.94]That was absolute dog shit.
[132:35.88]The NF is worse than last place.
[132:37.51]No, it's not.
[132:37.93]That means that I still tried.
[132:39.11]That guy killed me so I couldn't finish.
[132:49.76]What a dick.
[132:50.42]Yeah.
[132:52.01]That's also the guy that ran through mud, concrete, and like four explosions.
[132:56.77]And he was completely fine.
[132:58.13]No scratch on him.
[133:09.28]Purchases.
[133:10.54]All ammo.
[133:13.10]Arrows.
[133:13.44]I don't want this.
[133:19.63]We've got 14 people.
[133:20.45]Let me try this again.
[133:22.16]I have to try this again.
[133:22.98]I have to.
[133:23.36]I mean, what the hell?
[133:33.44]Mario Kart guns.
[133:42.87]How do you turn off GTA mode?
[133:44.71]I'm not sure you can.
[133:48.82]You're just gonna get angry like in Hitman.
[133:50.92]No, no.
[133:54.57]Is there actually a Battle Royale mode in the game?
[133:57.51]We'll do it after this.
[134:04.89]Yes, there is.
[134:05.49]Okay.
[134:05.75]$1 horse versus $1,000 horse.
[134:08.27]That's okay.
[134:17.03]Ride through all the signal fires around Valentine in any order.
[134:22.14]So, that's odd.
[134:24.28]You have to just touch every single one.
[134:29.12]How am I enjoying it so far?
[134:31.44]Um, it's fun.
[134:32.77]I can't really give you a true assessment of it, though, because I feel like I have to try to do everything.
[134:38.33]It still has the same annoying flaws from GTA Online that have somehow poured it over here.
[134:44.51]Huge loading screens between every single thing you do.
[134:50.90]But besides that... Alright, here we go.
[134:57.94]Melee combat is disabled.
[135:00.60]So you can go in any order.
[135:03.89]Why am I instantly losing?
[135:08.09]Is my character just suck?
[135:14.59]I think my character just sucks.
[135:23.03]What did I do that was so wrong there?
[135:24.25]I like touched him.
[135:31.60]Is it my horse?
[135:39.45]He's too top heavy.
[135:52.58]That's just killing me.
[135:55.72]I have weights on my character.
[135:59.77]I have extra pounds on.
[136:01.81]It's not fair.
[136:17.27]Why does it happen to me but not him?
[136:19.27]Why does it happen to me but not him?
[136:20.61]I'm gonna freak out.
[136:25.10]Why does it happen to me?
[136:26.86]Why does it only happen to me?
[136:28.82]It's not, that's not fair.
[136:31.76]Why?
[136:32.64]Hey!
[136:44.21]I'm gonna calm down.
[136:45.05]I have to calm down.
[136:50.39]He had more momentum?
[136:51.89]What?
[136:52.35]You can't just drive into somebody and not get hurt.
[136:54.89]I can't fucking believe it.
[137:03.84]That is absolute bullshit.
[137:06.34]I wonder if he's gonna touch me and I'm going to springboard off of the horse.
[137:13.90]Everybody's Donkey Kong and I get to be fucking Toad or Koopa Troopa.
[137:20.72]If that were me, I would have exploded.
[137:22.14]I would have spun a hundred times.
[137:30.80]I'm an NPC.
[137:32.48]I've come to terms with it.
[137:36.16]Everybody's playing the fun game and I get to be the guy that's here.
[137:39.12]The AI bot that just falls down.
[137:52.69]Didn't fall off that time.
[137:55.94]I only got three more.
[138:04.06]Everyone's not paying attention though, so I might have a chance to at least score some points.
[138:07.53]I'm not gonna finish, I'm not gonna finish.
[138:17.22]The reason why I'm not finishing is because I keep getting fucking destroyed on the horse.
[138:27.37]People will run full blast into me and just drive right through me like a ghost.
[138:48.00]Their horses are better in heavier weight classes.
[138:50.40]I probably look like such a fucking imbecile.
[138:56.59]I'm just such easy prey.
[138:58.35]I'm the fucking kid that got this for Christmas.
[139:03.09]Alright, I'm outta here.
[139:08.72]I'm outta here.
[139:15.22]What, I can't quit?
[139:18.13]Yes, I'm sure I want to exit.
[139:28.53]You're a Christmas noob.
[139:30.13]Guy comes in.
[139:31.79]Not even leveling up his horse.
[139:33.07]No armor, no nothing.
[139:36.15]And just gets bullied.
[139:37.23]Alright, what were the other things?
[139:39.89]What's the... Battle Royale mode?
[139:48.15]Is it Showdown series?
[139:54.82]Which one is it?
[140:00.06]Victory Royale.
[140:10.87]So stupid.
[140:14.88]You're doing Battle Royale with the pea shooters.
[140:17.08]I just want to try.
[140:24.69]Red Dead Mario Kart, Red Dead Fortnite.
[140:34.70]Just abuse the auto-aim.
[140:39.48]Auto-aim is not really that apparent and online to other players.
[140:46.17]32 player Battle Royale.
[140:48.01]Yeah.
[140:49.19]I'm gonna get a steak dinner, whatever they call it.
[140:52.16]I'm gonna get the fried chicken.
[140:54.24]Alright, let's go.
[141:10.74]What's the mode?
[141:13.98]What's the briefing?
[141:14.48]Let's see.
[141:19.25]Name your weapon.
[141:23.49]Where the... Free-for-all, where the trickier weapons earn more points per kill.
[141:28.83]What?
[141:30.31]Tomahawks will kill players in a single hit.
[141:33.79]Okay.
[141:35.49]Kill every... Dispatch opponents.
[141:37.91]Are they on the minimap, or is it just random people?
[141:41.91]Hmm.
[141:47.75]I hear noises.
[141:49.46]There we go.
[141:51.54]Okay.
[141:52.98]He doesn't know I'm behind him.
[142:21.75]Alright.
[142:22.25]Whoa!
[142:22.81]Whoa!
[142:23.01]Guy up there.
[142:28.23]Any more tomahawks?
[142:41.84]There he is.
[142:56.32]Anybody up on the rock?
[142:59.63]Oh, there's an item up here.
[143:00.53]There's a weapon up here.
[143:01.41]This is probably going to be... Yep.
[143:07.69]Get that item.
[143:20.12]Where is it?
[143:20.42]Where is it?
[143:20.66]Sniper rifle?
[143:21.08]Sniper rifle?
[143:28.51]Put it on!
[143:30.49]Put it on!
[143:31.01]Oh!
[143:31.31]You know how fast I can tap circle, buddy?
[143:43.35]Oh!
[143:46.39]How do I use it?
[143:46.97]R1, oh.
[143:49.43]I'm just a target up here.
[144:14.30]Battery's low.
[144:15.08]It's alright.
[144:28.77]Don't you dare.
[144:29.67]Don't you dare.
[144:30.29]Oh, come on!
[144:36.14]Oh, that's actually pissing me off.
[144:38.06]That actually pisses me off.
[144:39.82]I was doing really well.
[144:42.62]Oh, come on!
[144:49.47]I was doing- I always had to admit in either first or second place.
[144:59.14]Come on!
[145:07.31]That was fun.
[145:18.60]I'm so proud of you.
[145:20.17]Disconnected.
[145:20.91]Charged the button.
[145:21.31]What are you talking about?
[145:21.89]I just plugged it in.
[145:24.33]That's not plugged in?
[145:32.27]How am I not connected?
[145:39.31]What are you talking about?
[145:41.83]Why does this not understand that my controller is plugged in?
[145:49.71]Okay.
[145:55.82]Am I connected?
[145:57.64]Alright, I am.
[145:58.16]There we go.
[146:02.62]I have to charge my charger.
[146:07.67]I don't think I've been able to stay connected for more than... What?
[146:11.37]30 minutes?
[146:24.81]Sometimes less.
[146:27.25]Well, for the people that are asking how the game is and if it's any fun in multiplayer... I mean, it seems like it is.
[146:34.36]I sure would love to play it uninterrupted for more than 30 minutes.
[146:38.32]Kill all the players to rise up to the leaderboard.
[146:39.66]The higher you get, the more points you're worth.
[146:41.34]That's cool.
[146:48.13]Did I just join a random game here?
[146:51.77]There's a chest down there.
[146:54.21]Why is this not just- is this a nuke?
[147:11.11]I think I did it.
[147:11.97]I think I got- I shot him in the head like five times.
[147:22.79]That's probably so scary.
[147:33.54]PS4 aim.
[147:35.70]Well, I mean, I wish this was on PC.
[147:38.28]Fistful of Frags is one of my favorite shooters, like, ever.
[147:44.83]And having this on PC and actually control it with a mouse and keyboard at, like, 60 FPS, I would play this every day.
[147:51.69]Yeah, um, okay, sweet.
[147:55.39]Is that guy talking to me?
[148:03.47]That's like... I feel like you guys in chat have said that before, like, okay, yeah, whatever you say, dude.
[148:07.73]I can't turn this off, either.
[148:09.75]Can I?
[148:20.52]I can't turn it up.
[148:21.42]It's only on every... Why?
[148:24.30]Rockstar, why?
[148:28.18]Of all the things.
[148:34.13]Oh, yeah, baby.
[148:35.79]Oh, wait, hold on.
[148:37.45]You can actually use it in multiplayer?
[148:39.05]That seems so odd.
[148:40.29]Oh.
[148:51.75]Interesting.
[148:52.29]How do I turn it off?
[149:22.37]open voice chat is seriously just like it's such a distracting annoying thing in every video game it's like welcome to the wild west you play as arthur morgan and his band of misfits what time is it where are we shut up mom
[149:59.55]I think I lost.
[150:00.27]Is this gonna explode?
[150:03.77]Don't be rude to mom.
[150:05.47]I died five times.
[150:06.41]What?
[150:43.17]Alright, let's go, uh... MVP.
[151:03.44]You're a band of outlaws fighting over a treasure chest on the train tracks.
[151:08.04]Toot toot!
[151:08.66]Oh, be careful!
[151:14.83]Huh?
[151:15.75]Yeah, I love Cheez-Its.
[151:30.32]I'm gonna, I'm gonna do the mission.
[151:32.20]I'm gonna, I'm gonna do the mission.
[151:44.22]He has headphones.
[151:45.54]I only have one headphone in.
[151:52.34]Look at all these players.
[151:55.98]Where... I need to go from here to there.
[151:57.85]So I need to take the... Didn't I already... No, wait.
[152:00.37]Does this take money from me?
[152:02.13]How much money did I have before the game crashed?
[152:06.01]If it took money from me when I did this, I'm just bleeding money for no reason.
[152:11.29]Go to the options menu to turn off voice chat.
[152:13.20]I already did.
[152:14.00]I mean, I already did that.
[152:23.20]Honestly, you saw me do it.
[152:25.88]You saw me do it.
[152:29.08]I did it.
[152:29.40]You watched me do it.
[152:44.14]You saw me do it.
[152:46.31]You saw me do it.
[152:47.83]Right here.
[152:52.49]But, uh, what?
[152:54.43]What?
[152:55.01]Okay, what is this here for, then?
[153:01.63]That menu... Why don't you just put off there?
[153:09.00]That's only for the instance.
[153:12.40]Oh.
[153:14.12]Ooh.
[153:14.26]Alright, give me the stagecoach.
[153:16.86]Mmm, watch out.
[153:22.58]Right here.
[153:24.92]Same for GTA.
[153:27.59]Yeah, what the heck?
[153:37.03]Alright.
[153:37.97]I need to go to... Where was it?
[153:41.53]Blackwater?
[153:44.78]Blackwater.
[153:45.40]We gotta go there.
[153:46.38]And I'm gonna do the story mission with some online friends.
[153:53.38]And by the way, it did take the money from me.
[153:55.36]It processed the transaction.
[154:02.92]And it may have just did it again.
[154:04.12]And it may have just crashed it again.
[154:08.08]It's taking more money from me.
[154:10.82]I put in the $1.50 and I pressed Mountain Dew and it didn't fucking work.
[154:15.88]And then I put another dollar in, it's $1.50, didn't fucking work again.
[154:19.92]What am I supposed to do?
[154:21.08]Go get a manager?
[154:21.96]They don't even operate these things.
[154:23.94]I gotta call the number on the back of the vending machine?
[154:27.03]No, you're just gonna leave.
[154:43.29]Why did you do it two times?
[154:44.28]Because you were really thirsty and that was your only option.
[154:46.06]You thought maybe you could put a little bit more money and it would work.
[154:52.29]Oh!
[154:52.69]I wonder what just happened.
[154:54.97]You've been disconnected from Reddit due to a fault on the services.
[155:02.58]And now it's gonna- this is never-ending.
[155:04.58]It's gonna put me somewhere that I was before.
[155:07.34]So, I'm gonna never-endingly try- I'm just gonna fucking walk there.
[155:10.91]I'm just gonna walk there.
[155:12.03]I'm gonna get on the horse, and I'm just gonna walk there myself.
[155:15.51]Every time I try to get there quicker, it just deletes me from the game.
[155:23.82]For real.
[155:33.31]Stop purchasing from the broken vending machine.
[155:37.31]Play something else?
[155:39.64]I mean, I could... I want to play this, though.
[155:41.82]This is... This would be really fun if I could just play it.
[155:46.48]And I have been able to, in small snippets.
[155:50.03]I want to play this.
[155:50.97]I want to play this game.
[155:55.16]I want a Mountain Dew from this machine.
[155:58.08]I don't want a Sierra Mist from the other machine.
[156:00.98]Even if that machine works.
[156:03.08]I want a Mountain Dew.
[156:19.16]How far away am I?
[156:19.80]Let's see.
[156:23.52]No.
[156:23.64]Alright, what did you look at that?
[156:26.25]Okay.
[156:26.73]Please go across the entire video game again.
[156:29.27]Is there a boat here?
[156:30.99]I'm getting on a boat.
[156:34.69]Give me a boat.
[156:37.35]I will paddle across the whole ocean.
[156:38.97]You can just choose where to log in?
[156:44.71]Really?
[156:46.03]Well.
[156:50.98]Did somebody just do something bad here?
[156:52.50]Y'all should watch.
[156:53.92]It's me you're looking for, isn't it?
[156:58.42]Boat through the rain.
[157:03.08]Alright, let's see if I can get a boat.
[157:04.06]I mean, this is really cool.
[157:11.94]Mountain Dew tastes like pee and marijuana.
[157:16.04]Um, I don't think... Why do you know what those two things combined taste like?
[157:19.45]I mean, I can understand knowing what they both taste like.
[157:22.41]Right?
[157:23.59]But why do you know what they taste like together?
[157:46.53]Alright, so... I'm just going across... I'm just going across the whole Atlantic Ocean.
[157:55.77]Why would you know what marijuana tastes like?
[157:58.82]You can eat it.
[158:04.54]Well, you don't eat the leaf.
[158:07.24]Leaf.
[158:09.88]You boil it down.
[158:10.74]You smash it up.
[158:12.58]You put it in a food processor.
[158:13.88]You bake it.
[158:15.91]And you add, like, corn syrup.
[158:18.99]And sprinkle, like, cinnamon on it.
[158:20.55]And then put, um... Put, like, gelatin in it.
[158:24.43]And then mold it up into little shapes.
[158:26.01]And you have an edible.
[158:31.23]Alright, I need a boat.
[158:32.47]There's gotta be a boat lined up here for some random idiot like me.
[158:36.29]Yep.
[158:45.07]Alright, that was the first one.
[158:51.22]That was the first one.
[158:53.10]I'll take that loss there.
[158:54.12]That's 2 hours and 40 minutes, by the way.
[158:57.66]That's how long it took.
[158:58.36]That's a record.
[159:00.19]And there's no boat here.
[159:03.03]That's wildly unfortunate, but what is that?
[159:10.41]Just a bucket.
[159:11.07]God damn it.
[159:11.89]Give me... There's got to be a boat somewhere here.
[159:13.79]There's no just canoe... rowboat just on the shore, so I can just do this?
[159:26.25]There's another hideout over here.
[159:27.99]Do you have a boat?
[159:28.75]That's all I care about.
[159:35.08]Just swim forehead.
[160:05.92]How far is it?
[160:09.18]I'm not even crossing the right... the right place.
[160:15.25]I'm going across... I'm swimming... Let's just go across the English Channel.
[160:21.04]Rather than the Atlantic.
[160:33.55]Hey, this is the way to build stamina.
[160:35.35]That's for sure.
[160:40.53]It's gonna take longer to swim than ride your horse.
[160:43.33]I know.
[160:44.05]But... And I didn't... What did I even do here?
[160:47.13]I just... I would have already been there if I didn't get... The stop blue screen error code.
[160:53.16]X0X00021.
[160:53.48]What the hell it was.
[161:07.45]Options.
[161:07.81]Press the options button.
[161:08.55]Select online then go to free roam.
[161:09.99]And then West Elizabeth.
[161:15.05]How do I select where I want to go?
[161:16.23]Free roam.
[161:16.57]Right where it is.
[161:17.98]Where it is.
[161:18.32]There it is.
[161:19.84]Thank you.
[161:29.47]Just jump on each water droplet until you get there.
[161:50.66]Wouldn't that mean that the rain is solid to a point where you can stand on it, which means it can carry and hold enough weight for you to stand on it?
[161:59.40]Therefore, all life is wiped out because you're essentially dropping tiny little concrete bricks on everything, on every person, on everything, on every animal, every tree.
[162:18.86]I guess so, yeah.
[162:20.94]Like hail, but you can't stand on hail.
[162:24.31]If it was two pounds per pebble, and hundreds of millions of them were falling at the same time.
[162:36.08]You would just turn everybody into... It would be a giant food processor.
[162:40.02]We'd be inside the stomach of a turkey.
[162:45.00]Turkeys eat rocks to digest all the food.
[162:49.47]That's what would happen.
[162:50.93]Well, we're already here.
[162:52.49]We made it.
[162:52.97]Finally.
[162:54.31]We're in Blackwater.
[163:00.40]What's this mean?
[163:36.86]Why is he chasing after the wagon?
[163:42.23]How do I whistle to him?
[163:43.99]Arrival posse has started the mission.
[163:45.39]Eliminate the target!
[163:58.32]Is that... No, that's... This is me from the past.
[164:23.44]Can I actually get him in this?
[164:29.17]Oh my god!
[164:32.95]What?
[164:39.52]Oh fu-
[164:58.23]That was fucking funny.
[165:05.08]Who the fuck are you?
[165:06.49]Oh shit, it's you!
[165:07.23]I got him!
[165:09.55]There's lag.
[165:10.39]Little bit of lag there.
[165:25.37]So, if you get somebody in the lasso, can I, like, tie them up, actually?
[165:29.06]Like, hogtie them?
[165:36.04]No.
[165:36.54]So that's why, because that's what I was taking so long to do.
[165:46.46]What?! !
[166:08.34]There's like three people there as friends.
[166:10.53]Where are my friends?
[166:13.97]I'm just a random fucking farmer from down the road that heard noise outside of his house.
[166:19.08]What's all that racket out here, you little bastards?
[166:46.78]It's a four man party.
[166:50.54]One, two, three, four.
[166:51.49]Me and my shitty horse.
[166:53.61]And then this guy.
[167:09.28]Sean is not a shitty horse.
[167:11.02]Alright, fuck this.
[167:12.80]You wanna see the real Red Dead Redemption?
[167:16.84]Farmer Joe was going full speed into the fucking party of four.
[167:31.36]That wasn't even one of them.
[167:36.65]That wasn't even one of them.
[167:37.91]And they- I fell off my horse, but they didn't.
[167:41.27]Fucking typical.
[167:42.43]My horse is dead.
[168:10.23]Thank god for horse insurance.
[168:18.66]Rockstar online.
[168:21.82]Just get in a party of four and bully the farmer that's level five.
[168:25.68]I gotta like do something, fuck it.
[168:31.78]I gotta fuck something up here.
[168:41.06]Who the fuck is that?
[168:42.48]We are friends.
[168:43.18]We're friends, right?
[168:43.74]We're friends.
[168:44.10]We're friends.
[168:44.52]We're friends, right?
[168:45.28]You and I are friends.
[168:47.06]Let me get on your horse.
[168:47.72]We have to work together.
[168:51.18]Don't you understand?
[168:55.84]Hi, Sean.
[169:04.49]Good luck doing anything with your old man hands.
[169:06.53]Alright, I don't want to go that way.
[169:08.09]But they're in the town, too.
[169:14.58]At least maybe the lawmen will come out.
[169:20.01]They're just hanging out over here.
[169:21.15]Oh god, he's on the road!
[169:42.66]I got my revenge.
[169:43.88]I don't even care.
[169:48.60]I was trying to run him over.
[169:59.19]Wait, that wasn't them?
[170:01.91]That was the guy that had the star on his name, right?
[170:20.27]What is this guy doing?
[170:22.43]Are you friendly?
[170:27.42]Alright.
[170:27.62]Hold on.
[170:27.84]What's the emote?
[170:31.92]How do you emote?
[170:35.12]I'm trying to prove... No, put the knife away.
[170:37.12]Okay.
[170:51.25]Okay.
[170:53.98]He doesn't want to kill me.
[170:54.76]Good.
[171:15.77]It seems to stuff with the absolute most
[171:19.56]The worst possible moments, right?
[171:23.06]Oh, look, there's a guy there.
[171:24.40]You're gonna maybe make a friend and go do some stuff.
[171:27.91]Oh, you're doing really well in this online session where you're probably... No, no, no.
[171:37.93]Yeah, only when I get fucking bullied is when they want to keep the servers on.
[171:50.82]I've played 14 hours and have never gotten kicked.
[171:55.16]I wonder why it's... I mean, is this happening to anybody else?
[172:03.40]Or is this just a... Is this just a me problem?
[172:10.21]Yeah, it's happening to you.
[172:11.43]Yeah, me, me, me.
[172:14.41]Rockstar, hey, come on.
[172:16.59]I want to play this.
[172:18.07]I just got two in a row.
[172:20.33]I got the one with the two, and now I got one with the nine.
[172:24.07]Now, it won't even let me exit the game.
[172:30.43]Now, I'm gonna... I'm gonna... No, hold on.
[172:32.76]Let me go take a piss.
[172:34.52]I'll be right back.
[172:35.14]I'm gonna exit, restart.
[172:36.76]We'll try it one more time.
[172:40.46]I wanna play this!
[172:42.32]This is what I wanna play, but I can't do it.
[172:45.21]Well, I can, but just for not very long.
[172:48.67]Give me one second.
[172:49.17]I'm gonna grab another water and take a piss.
[172:52.12]See you soon.
[173:28.68]Thank you.
[174:33.65]Hmm.
[175:56.18]Alright.
[176:16.00]I can't open it.
[176:16.42]I'm not strong enough to open this.
[176:19.94]What the fuck?
[176:28.09]Mountain Dew.
[176:34.15]Let's go back into this.
[176:36.14]Try it again.
[176:36.58]All right.
[176:43.26]I'm going to restart it.
[176:47.78]I shouldn't have to do this, rock star.
[176:59.35]Go fuck some people up online.
[177:00.93]I'm trying.
[177:01.61]I'm trying to get it done.
[177:13.54]Please drink verification.
[177:15.48]What?
[177:21.26]Alright, here we go.
[177:21.90]Let's go.
[177:33.26]Oh, it's from a meme.
[177:36.47]I see.
[177:36.95]I get it.
[177:38.55]Well, actually, I don't get it.
[177:40.67]I don't know what you mean by that.
[177:43.01]But I get that it's a reference to something.
[177:54.04]Do I still drink Dr. Pepper?
[177:55.52]I don't really drink soda that much anymore.
[178:01.62]Except when it's an ice-cold, frothy Mountain Dew.
[178:09.56]That's a Coke, by the way.
[178:10.74]That's a Coke Cola.
[178:16.98]Yeah, I drink probably like a soda.
[178:19.82]Maybe like two sodas a week.
[178:22.02]Once a week, maybe.
[178:23.64]I drink a lot more water than anything else.
[178:26.29]Nowadays.
[178:29.97]No, not diet.
[178:32.15]Don't drink diet soda.
[178:44.55]Imagine drinking water?
[178:47.51]Water's gross.
[178:48.19]What's wrong with water?
[178:49.38]You guys don't like water?
[178:50.14]I mean, water's boring, but... You have to drink it.
[179:02.41]Otherwise, you'll shrivel up into dust.
[179:06.53]Alright, where the hell am I?
[179:08.09]Didn't I select Blackwater?
[179:11.73]Why am I all the way over here?
[179:12.67]I'm going to just... I'm going to take what I can get at this point.
[179:20.22]I want to do this mission.
[179:22.18]I'm going to get on the horse, and I'm going to walk to that mission, and I'm going to stand in the circle and go to the mission.
[179:28.16]That's what I'm going to do.
[179:31.38]Water's not boring?
[179:32.22]Well, boring in the sense that water doesn't have a taste.
[179:37.26]It is just tasteless.
[179:39.79]Tasteless, colorless, no additives.
[179:41.91]It's just nothing.
[179:42.55]It's just there.
[179:43.63]And you need it.
[179:46.17]You have no horses.
[179:51.89]What happened to my other horse?
[180:02.03]It got deleted?
[180:04.34]Why is that?
[180:11.28]Come here, you little shit.
[180:20.07]Why can I not s- Whatever.
[180:26.45]Alright, let's go.
[180:34.52]I'm not gonna shoot it.
[180:35.72]I don't need it right now.
[180:37.18]I need to just stay focused and go straight on the GPS.
[180:41.92]Get to the mission and hope that I can do it.
[180:44.61]And enjoy myself in RDR2O.
[180:51.15]RDR2O.
[180:55.79]I hate that title now.
[180:57.99]That title was just a stupid reference I was making with like a hundred people in the chat.
[181:07.23]I'm changing it to that.
[181:29.80]Yeah, that was like an IGN Plays Red Dead Online reference.
[181:37.87]Yeah, that's better.
[181:40.67]The lawless land of RDR2 Online!
[181:45.76]Please.
[181:47.50]Don't run into him, please.
[181:57.82]Shut up.
[181:58.20]What?
[181:58.64]Why did you tell me to shut up?
[181:59.66]Why'd you say that, you?
[182:00.62]Why'd you say that to me?
[182:18.99]I gotta be careful.
[182:20.07]I'm almost there.
[182:20.77]Just let... ...the Rockstar servers stay online for me to play another mission with people.
[182:42.97]Almost there.
[182:44.23]I'm gonna go very slow too.
[182:45.51]I'm gonna get off the horse and I'm gonna walk into the marker.
[182:48.49]Because maybe I'm just going too fast and the game is trying to transition me to another instance or another server and it's just kicking me out.
[182:53.48]Where are all the random events?
[183:07.34]Um, that's a good question.
[183:10.87]I think... They're the peach markers on the screen, right?
[183:16.28]Aren't those the new random kind of stranger events?
[183:23.14]We're almost there.
[183:24.70]Come on.
[183:25.28]Just get me over there and I'm going to walk off the horse.
[183:30.77]Okay.
[183:31.55]Slowly.
[183:32.81]Let it load what I want to do.
[183:37.05]Invite compete with other players in free roam events dispatch rider No, no No, I should have just done it I should have just walked into the circle I had an opportunity to do it and I didn't do it.
[184:00.08]Oh
[184:23.39]small indie company well we are testing the servers so hopefully they're getting all the data that they need this is a this is a qa data data beta test stream you're watching live qa is what you're I'm not broadcasting red dead I'm broadcasting testing I guess that is what I'm doing
[185:01.06]Oh, well.
[185:11.39]And why am I playing?
[185:12.13]Just to suffer.
[185:13.97]Because I feel like when it works, it's going to be fun.
[185:16.89]And it has.
[185:17.45]And when it does work, it's interesting.
[185:21.77]And now I'm back here again.
[185:25.43]I'm going to go... No, I don't want to do that.
[185:28.13]Just go to the map.
[185:29.61]Where am I?
[185:30.13]I'm so much further away now than I was before.
[185:34.83]This is just unbelievable.
[185:40.78]This really is turning into suffering at this point.
[185:43.06]But I want to do it.
[185:44.40]I want to play it.
[185:50.12]Here comes a bad review.
[185:58.46]Just buy a plane.
[186:06.41]Just reload until I spawn there.
[186:08.07]I could probably get there faster than reloading the game one time.
[186:10.61]Okay.
[186:21.29]Don't do anything.
[186:23.55]Just get there.
[186:24.95]Don't do anything.
[186:25.57]Don't say anything.
[186:28.39]I was fucking reading the chat because I was seeing... Don't do it.
[186:37.46]Just forget him.
[186:45.10]I couldn't even control it!
[186:47.41]I couldn't turn!
[186:48.61]You... Pull it back!
[186:50.51]Pull it back!
[186:51.55]I want you to pull it back!
[186:53.15]Pull it back!
[186:54.15]Give me a clip of that.
[186:54.79]I'm not fucking around.
[186:56.15]Clip that because you can hear me press right on the stick.
[187:00.48]Clip it and show it to me.
[187:01.62]Right now.
[187:12.40]Listen to this.
[187:12.78]I want you to listen to the click of the analog.
[187:21.31]I was fucking reading the chat because I was seeing... Listen to the click.
[187:27.71]Don't do it.
[187:30.36]Just forget him.
[187:44.96]Do you hear that?
[187:47.10]Do you hear that?
[187:47.50]Listen to it one more time.
[187:58.08]I couldn't even control it.
[188:02.93]I couldn't control it.
[188:10.81]This is a slight click.
[188:12.46]No, I swear to God.
[188:14.14]I've done dumb things before.
[188:15.80]I've fallen off fucking cliffs.
[188:43.62]You see I'm laughing because okay, I felt that I told you I do that I fucking them absent-minded some dumb shit happens But that was not the case that time just get me to the mission This enough wouldn't have happened if I could just play the game that I wanted to play like 40 minutes ago.
[189:00.79]Oh Okay, I think it's time to stop
[189:32.36]Superior Vegas Internet.
[189:33.84]That's not my internet.
[189:34.86]That's not me.
[189:36.81]I'm losing the connection to their servers are dropping.
[189:40.47]That didn't do anything.
[189:45.86]Try again another day.
[189:46.90]What is here is probably fun.
[189:53.83]I mean, I really wanted to... I really wanted to save Jackbox for Friday, because we could do it the whole time.
[190:00.07]And we could spend, like, five, six, seven hours in it.
[190:02.53]Because, I mean, it's not like I have a time limit for the streams, but...
[190:19.69]I usually start to get pretty tired after like five or six hours streaming.
[190:25.91]And then at about six to eight is where I usually call it a night.
[190:30.53]And I really don't want to... I want to give it the time it deserves.
[190:32.74]That's what we're doing on Friday.
[190:37.12]Stick to the plan.
[190:42.76]I'm there, I'm there, I'm there, I'm there.
[190:43.84]Hold on.
[190:48.48]Didn't have time to kick me out.
[190:49.28]I just got in.
[190:49.80]It's like currently beeping.
[190:50.80]It's currently beeping to get me.
[190:52.20]I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.
[190:56.38]Didn't have time to kick me out.
[190:57.22]I just connected.
[191:00.58]Oh, whoops.
[191:10.95]Always a strange one, Horley.
[191:13.15]How is Mr. Leclerc?
[191:14.52]About as you'd expect.
[191:15.80]I expect a lot.
[191:17.38]I muted an act.
[191:18.04]Yeah, I did.
[191:19.44]Leclerc was a good man.
[191:20.80]A fine man.
[191:22.82]That he was.
[191:24.32]And this fella?
[191:25.52]Well, that's their business.
[191:26.76]Sorry, it's my first time streaming, yeah.
[191:28.87]The world's business is kindness and gentleness and evil and brutality.
[191:36.41]What else is there, mister?
[191:37.95]There's a whole lot else besides like lust and greed and...
[191:43.70]Stupidity.
[191:45.12]Oh, Mr. Jones is stupid.
[191:48.80]Oh, Jones is old.
[191:50.24]Oh, Jones has cooked himself in the sun.
[191:53.80]I know, I know.
[191:54.88]Get yourself something to eat.
[191:56.30]Those fellas need help.
[191:58.47]Maybe this fella can help them.
[192:00.39]Maybe.
[192:00.73]Did I beat the game?
[192:04.17]I did not.
[192:04.83]I'm at about the 43, 44 percentile.
[192:10.03]What they do hereafter...
[192:12.47]By the way, make sure everyone is aware because this is the last time I'm going to be able to talk about it.
[192:32.93]If you have a... Did this make money?
[192:35.89]Did somebody just take money from me?
[192:37.05]That was weird.
[192:37.91]I'm not streaming tomorrow, so this is the last time I'm going to be able to talk about it before Saturday or Friday.
[192:44.24]And at that point, it's too late.
[192:53.83]So as of tomorrow, midnight tomorrow, midnight tomorrow, Pacific or Eastern, I'm not sure.
[193:04.16]But tomorrow night late is your last opportunity to put a submission in for the movie night.
[193:09.30]Thursday, tomorrow night.
[193:10.18]If you do not have a submission in, then you are not eligible for Sunday's movie night.
[193:28.66]Now, I've seen some people say, hey, my submission is two minutes and 40 seconds.
[193:34.70]My submission is three minutes.
[193:36.48]Can you show this?
[193:37.10]It's like three and a half minutes.
[193:39.47]Not for Sunday.
[193:44.19]Sunday is strictly for these submissions in that channel.
[193:52.73]If you go to the Discord in the movie night,
[193:56.48]channel all the very specific rules that are pinned there in that channel I don't have a horse so we have to what do I have to go all the is there anybody even doing this with me I mean at this point I can't I can't
[194:26.55]load into free roam I have to I have to just like go to single player or something but now that's not what I wanted to do it's such annoying um yeah I can't just keep trying I'm gonna have to try tomorrow the next night no not tomorrow I cannot stream tomorrow um
[194:57.52]Load in a different place.
[195:00.58]Not West Elizabeth.
[195:03.38]Yeah, but even when I was in these, I was dumping out on these too.
[195:08.36]Remember, I was doing exceptionally well.
[195:11.31]I got disconnected.
[195:16.93]Load in New Austin.
[195:18.65]Well, for the purposes of... Can I change my region?
[195:23.75]No, I don't think so.
[195:24.53]I don't think there's any way to do that.
[195:29.05]Alright, here's what's going to happen.
[195:32.81]I'm going to try one more time in a different place.
[195:38.88]And if it doesn't work, then I'm just going to go play fucking Peggle 2.
[195:44.18]For like an hour or two or something.
[195:46.54]God damn it, that's so... Go to story mode or... I don't know.
[195:52.35]We'll try it again.
[195:53.01]You gotta have faith.
[196:00.21]Well, sorry to all those people watching that were expecting to see Red Dead Redemption 2 multiplayer.
[196:06.05]And what exclusivity we got here.
[196:10.57]Exclusively.
[196:11.17]Hey, if you bought this game day one and you supported Rockstar and got in and played a bunch on the first day, you got rewarded.
[196:18.95]When you get to play the beta, you get to play the beta early.
[196:22.47]There it is.
[196:27.94]Doesn't quite work.
[196:30.31]And when it does, it seems like a fucking lot of fun.
[196:33.71]But the beta has just seemed like a gigantic network stress test, which makes sense.
[196:38.05]Okay, that's fine.
[196:39.88]But not really completely playable yet.
[196:49.20]We can't even do it again.
[196:50.73]Oh, well, well.
[196:59.03]This will fault on Rockstar's game services.
[197:04.37]Okay.
[197:06.45]Well.
[197:14.86]Peggle time.
[197:21.72]No, I don't want to... God damn it.
[197:25.50]If, okay, if the stream had been going for, like, five hours, maybe, like, Peggle too, okay, that's funny, for, like, 40 minutes.
[197:39.95]Just played Red.
[197:40.59]I, I... Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[197:45.39]It's kind of completely out of my hands at this point.
[197:50.02]So... Um...
[197:54.01]I mean, I could... Here's what's going to happen.
[197:56.59]Alright, let's be real.
[197:59.99]I have to install Peggle 2, and it's going to take like six hours.
[198:05.59]I'm going to move to a Red Dead single player.
[198:08.21]I still am like halfway through the game.
[198:11.31]And then, after like an hour or so, like another hour, two hours or something, we'll try the multiplayer again.
[198:25.71]We'll just stay in Red Dead.
[198:27.36]Because that's what I wanted to do.
[198:28.64]I wanted to play Red Dead.
[198:31.06]And once we go off the rails, and it's like, oh, Peggle!
[198:34.82]And then Bloodborne!
[198:35.64]And then, um, um, uh... What else do I have on PS4?
[198:39.04]Uh, Flash games!
[198:40.90]Nah, I'd rather just stay fairly, uh... Fairly in the same realm.
