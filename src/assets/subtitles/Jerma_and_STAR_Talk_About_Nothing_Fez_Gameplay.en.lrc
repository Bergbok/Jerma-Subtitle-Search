[00:08.74]Today's a special day.
[00:10.55]Adventure is ready.
[00:11.63]It's Gomez time.
[00:13.51]Yay.
[00:14.71]Any time now.
[00:16.37]Just you wait.
[00:18.43]There you go.
[00:20.45]Yay.
[00:21.49]This thing is vibrating on my penis.
[00:26.40]I gotta like lift that up.
[00:28.26]Please stop vibrating on Jerma's penis.
[00:30.34]He's just trying to play the game.
[00:32.08]I just want to play Fez.
[00:33.06]I just want to play this dumb indie game that I heard was good.
[00:36.41]Well, then it's not dumb, is it?
[00:39.76]This is pretty dumb what's happening right now.
[00:43.48]Is it still vibrating on your penis?
[00:46.48]Alright, we got 3D inside 2D.
[00:48.72]Alright, cool.
[00:50.58]Yeah, that's the plot of the game.
[00:51.88]You discover the third dimension.
[00:53.32]And we got, like, a weird, like, TV changer beeper that's up in there, like, telling me, like, directions.
[00:59.74]Can you just enjoy life?
[01:04.52]What is this?
[01:05.08]What is this like McDonald's french fry box?
[01:07.90]I don't know.
[01:10.00]I wish you could see this.
[01:11.65]Oh, it's a Fez!
[01:12.79]It's the Fez!
[01:16.51]Yay!
[01:17.77]Fezzes are cool.
[01:18.73]Why is Doctor Who 2?
[01:20.15]Wow, alright, this is way more interesting than I thought it was gonna be.
[01:24.47]The game's breaking.
[01:26.95]Why?
[01:27.15]I don't know.
[01:29.11]I didn't do it.
[01:29.81]Like, I'm just sitting here playing at 10 million.
[01:30.99]It's doing that thing.
[01:32.78]Oh, you know in regular Nintendo games when the game crashes and it has those weird pixelated colored things?
[01:38.31]It's doing that right now.
[01:41.41]On purpose?
[01:42.23]Yeah, like on purpose.
[01:43.99]Oh.
[01:45.11]You're making it sound so dramatic.
[01:46.63]This is so cool!
[01:49.89]It just pretended to restart the computer.
[01:53.32]I think you're spoiling the experience for me when I play it.
[01:56.30]Because now it's going to happen to me and I'm not going to think it's cool.
[01:58.76]I'm going to think it's boring.
[01:59.92]Why am I at the menu again?
[02:02.11]Maybe it restarted.
[02:03.73]Did I, like, just... Did this, like, just fuck up?
[02:10.32]Something went wrong.
[02:11.24]I need your help.
[02:12.12]I was sent to guide you.
[02:13.06]I am gut.
[02:14.64]The Hexaphysium fragment.
[02:17.06]The what?
[02:18.70]Give your life story to somebody else.
[02:20.08]I got, like, places to be, fuckface.
[02:25.19]Alright.
[02:29.67]On second thought, I'm not sure how much of this game I can even play.
[02:33.25]Why?
[02:34.09]Because it's gonna make me sick.
[02:41.80]Stop complaining, it's artistic.
[02:46.96]Hey honey, you wanna kiss?
[02:50.77]Get up there!
[02:53.81]Punch this nerd in the glasses.
[02:56.29]Where's the blood?
[02:59.59]Where's the punch nerding glasses button?
[03:08.65]I can't open this.
[03:11.31]They stole this from Zelda.
[03:13.67]Zelda copied Zelda.
[03:20.76]Twilight Princess copied Majora's Mask.
[03:23.70]This game is a copy of League of Legends.
[03:27.38]Why do you think I copied League?
[03:29.85]See, there's like a person that you control.
[03:31.63]It's just League of Legends copy.
[03:33.95]Every game has Wukong now that League did it.
[03:36.49]I just like fell to my death.
[03:38.82]Whoops.
[03:39.66]Wow, League did it first.
[03:43.50]Um, I don't know what to do.
[03:45.02]I think I have to go open that.
[03:45.84]Yeah, I gotta go open this door.
[03:47.90]Wow.
[03:49.00]Scrub doesn't even know what to do.
[03:51.66]Remember guys, this is a full let's play of this game.
[03:56.89]I guess I got a key.
[03:58.04]Hey guys, this is the final episode of this game.
[04:04.71]It's funny because it's true.
[04:07.43]Hey, this isn't a Let's Play channel, it's a First Impressions channel.
[04:12.75]Yeah, this is my first impression of Fez.
[04:14.49]And my first impression is... Pretty sick.
[04:19.74]I wish you'd go in these doors.
[04:21.70]Don't go in the doors.
[04:22.94]Too late.
[04:24.90]It's gonna be something spooky.
[04:27.71]No, I... I suck at fucking playing video games.
[04:33.79]I, like, have no idea what's going on.
[04:35.71]Hold on.
[04:36.39]Can I spin this world around?
[04:39.25]Oh!
[04:40.57]There's a chest over there.
[04:43.11]Oh, I just... Dude, you... Remember how I just said I suck at video games?
[04:45.77]Yeah.
[04:46.37]What a lie that was.
[04:47.45]I just found a secret fucking chest.
[04:50.35]Is it hairy?
[04:51.09]Is it, like, a hairy chest?
[04:53.49]No, I just got, like, my second stock.
[04:55.30]This is like a Mario 64 ripoff.
[05:01.24]What didn't this game rip off?
[05:05.13]This game, in reality, is actually pretty, like... Pretty, like, interesting, actually.
[05:17.49]Where are these last two pieces?
[05:20.11]Where's my little Navi?
[05:23.15]She goes, Hey, listen!
[05:27.95]Like, from the Avatar movie?
[05:29.73]Like,
[05:31.87]Navi?
[05:32.49]What is the name of the... The stupid thing from Link.
[05:36.69]Legend from Link.
[05:38.89]What is the fairy's name?
[05:40.75]Navi, right?
[05:42.43]There's like a different one every game.
[05:44.59]What's the one in Ocarina of Time?
[05:46.10]I don't know.
[05:46.58]I've never played it.
[05:48.48]You've... You've never played Ocarina of Time?
[05:52.56]No, I've never played any Zelda game.
[05:54.18]The most I've played of a Zelda game was the one for like Nintendo.
[05:57.52]Like the very first one I played like 10 minutes of.
[06:01.98]Wow.
[06:02.28]Oh my god.
[06:07.10]You just pissed off every single person in this comment section.
[06:09.89]That's either watching and or not watching.
[06:12.29]I'm taking so long to beat the first tutorial.
[06:20.91]It's okay.
[06:21.67]It's a first impression.
[06:23.21]Shit, I'm so fucking dumb.
[06:25.68]No, I died.
[06:29.88]Well, thank you so much for watching, friends.
[06:32.05]Let's play.
[06:36.27]Where's this last cube?
[06:38.67]Where's this last cube?
[06:42.46]Okay, Star, I will give you a thousand dollars if you can find where this last little cube is.
[06:48.78]I will turn the game on and probably catch up to where you are in 30 seconds and find it.
[06:56.07]I'm... I would probably assume that you would do that.
[06:58.85]You'd be able to do that very easily.
[07:01.18]This whole video.
[07:02.86]Wait a... Oh, I used one of the keys!
[07:04.36]Oh, yeah!
[07:06.42]Yeah, give me that map, you prick.
[07:10.92]Why are you such a dick?
[07:12.60]I don't know.
[07:13.24]Like the little virtual pixel guys.
[07:17.45]That guy just told me, I picked up a map, and he goes, Oh, you found a map.
[07:20.71]Figure it out for yourself.
[07:22.55]I swear to God, that's what he just said.
[07:25.52]Aren't you sick of games holding your hand, Jeremiah?
[07:28.34]Play a game.
[07:29.42]Figure it out yourself.
[07:30.32]I'm almost 30.
[07:31.52]I need my hand held for stuff like this.
[07:34.05]Do you know me?
[07:35.83]I know you.
[07:36.39]Have we met before?
[07:37.73]Yeah.
[07:38.61]Do you know me?
[07:40.31]I think your name is, like, Greg.
[07:45.61]Still on tutorial level, by the way.
[07:50.49]Oh, I found it.
[07:51.09]I found it.
[07:52.21]This door hasn't been opened.
[07:56.82]Yes.
[07:57.50]There's the last one.
[07:59.98]Fez.
[08:01.00]Baby.
[08:02.40]Hooray!
[08:03.28]You did it!
[08:05.14]Yay!
[08:07.04]Get a cube!
[08:07.94]Get a cube!
[08:08.94]Get a cube, cube, cube, cube, cube!
[08:10.74]Get a cube!
[08:11.64]Get a cube!
[08:13.30]You did it.
[08:14.42]Now you can unseal the door.
[08:15.60]Let's go!
[08:16.02]Let's go!
[08:17.00]Hooray!
[08:17.40]Yes!
[08:22.53]I died.
[08:31.70]No, shit!
[08:35.70]I'm so impatient, I just want to drop.
[08:40.06]Drop.
[08:41.68]Where's this door that I can unseal?
[08:43.10]There it is.
[08:45.10]Ladies and gentlemen, that's the tutorial.
[08:49.47]Are you ready to begin your adventure?
[08:53.55]Yeah, sure.
[08:55.23]Hey, listen.
[08:56.27]This is outside the village.
[08:57.45]Be careful.
[08:58.03]Use the world map.
[09:01.24]That's okay.
[09:01.71]I'm going to get there.
[09:02.53]I'm going to get there.
[09:04.46]Okay, bye.
