[00:08.42]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.95]Jeremiah here with a outdoor vlog.
[00:13.15]I've never done one of these before, but look, you want to see?
[00:16.03]I'm really outside.
[00:17.05]I know, right?
[00:18.05]It's crazy.
[00:19.21]A nerd like me going outside?
[00:21.03]Yeah, right.
[00:23.02]But I wanted to make this video because obviously it's beautiful outside.
[00:26.46]It's kind of late, but it was beautiful outside earlier.
[00:29.66]But I wanted to make this video to give a couple of updates on certain things because I get asked these questions a lot of times, so...
[00:36.38]Grandpa.
[00:37.60]Grandpa is coming back to Machinima Respawn next month.
[00:41.86]There's going to be a trailer for Grandpa next week, I think, for Season 2.
[00:48.33]So if you're wondering, Jerma, where did Grandpa go?
[00:50.97]How come there's been no Grandpa for, like, five weeks on Machinima Respawn?
[00:55.47]It's because it was taken into an off-season, and it's coming back.
[00:59.29]Don't worry.
[01:00.07]So, May.
[01:01.19]Look for Grandpa.
[01:02.29]Oh my god, a bug just, like, landed on me.
[01:05.22]bug bastards.
[01:06.76]So look for Grandpa in May on Machinima Respawn, and I'm working on it right now, it's gonna be ridiculous, so.
[01:13.91]The second thing, there's a lot of wind right now, hopefully it's not ruining this entire footage, but the second thing is gonna be about my server, my Team Fortress 2 server.
[01:23.41]And I bought it, it's all set up, it's all ready to go, but...
[01:28.95]I want to talk to somebody that knows about servers.
[01:32.29]I have an appointment with Shibby2142.
[01:35.58]He knows what he's talking about, so before I make the server public and the server live and all that stuff, I want to make sure it's good to go and I have all the settings as good as I can possibly have them, so stay tuned.
[01:48.87]I'll make another video.
[01:50.05]I'll mention it in another video, but yes, the server is coming along.
[01:54.71]One week from today, it should be live.
[01:56.75]That's my prediction.
[01:59.73]Otto, what are you doing?
[02:02.33]My dog is running around in circles around the yard.
[02:05.27]And speaking of Otto, I don't know if you can hear that, but speaking of Otto, a lot of people have asked this.
[02:11.11]They want to see more Otto.
[02:12.95]If you don't know, Otto is my little dog, my little Dachshund, Doberman, Chihuahua thing that I got like a month ago.
[02:22.49]And I showed him in one video, and that was all it took.
[02:24.85]Everyone loves Otto.
[02:25.77]They want to see him.
[02:27.45]So, okay, here you go.
[02:30.46]Oh, God!
[02:31.85]He's coming to get me.
[02:32.51]Come on!
[02:33.29]Come on!
[02:34.03]What do you got?
[02:35.19]What do you got?
[02:36.91]Come on!
[02:38.91]Ah, that's my shoe.
[02:44.13]You are a freak.
[02:45.64]Look at that face!
[02:46.68]Oh, my God!
[02:47.38]Wait, what?
[02:49.56]Oh, I'm going to pick up this stick that's like ten times bigger than my body.
[02:54.96]This is actually going to work.
[02:58.06]What an idiot.
[02:58.50]Hey, don't eat that.
[03:02.27]So thank you all so much for watching.
[03:04.21]I really do.
[03:04.69]It's cold out.
[03:05.75]My lips are like all numb.
[03:06.89]So like talking is like.
[03:09.27]But thank you guys so much for watching.
[03:11.14]I really do appreciate it.
[03:12.42]And I will see you guys all next time.
[03:14.40]So peace, love and take care, everybody.
