[00:23.00]This is a different mission, right?
[00:24.68]Yeah.
[00:25.06]I got the dispenser there for you.
[00:27.22]Oh, we have no medics or anything.
[00:28.40]I think, like... I don't know what I think.
[00:35.28]Oh yeah, they are punching heavies.
[00:38.84]Oh my gosh, they're all the time.
[00:41.83]Someone's gonna need to get the money from them.
[00:43.39]I'll get it, I'll get it.
[00:46.95]Oh, they're dropping down.
[00:51.55]He wants the D. Punchy Heavy flanking our dispenser!
[00:57.74]Punchy Heavy down.
[00:58.34]I'm just gonna move my sentry up so I can auto-shoot because, I mean, they're heavies.
[01:06.19]Okay, I'll just hold up top since they keep getting on top.
[01:11.91]Dude, here comes a Texas man!
[01:13.11]Texas man!
[01:13.77]Oh no, Texas man!
[01:16.46]Oh, Jesus Christ.

[01:21.46]I got him.
[01:22.30]He dropped money, though.
[01:23.36]I need to go get him.
[01:29.32]My Jurati doesn't sell yet.
[01:31.22]I sapped it.

[02:06.41]Yeah, I'm gonna take the jelly, they have Uber.
[02:08.07]No, they're out-punching my sentry!
[02:10.03]I got the gun and the energy.
[02:13.17]Ooh, look at that crit.
[02:20.65]Missing 12, Stabby.
[02:22.94]Where is the- We're missing 6, you missed 6!
[02:27.12]Wow.
[02:28.00]I trusted you.
[02:29.58]Watch out for this boss though.
[02:30.46]Never trust a spy.
[02:38.25]That was, uh... That was, uh... I don't know.
[02:42.53]It was pretty fun.
[02:43.19]It's not bad.
[02:43.99]It's interesting when you don't have phonetics.
[02:46.77]Dude, I think I'm actually going to turn off my hit sound for this, because it's just like... You gotta get a pleasant hit sound that you want to hear as much as you can.
[02:56.44]I get a cowbell, that's what I recommend.
[02:58.98]Cowbell.
[02:59.82]Because you can always use more cowbells.
[03:04.36]Stevie, what do I have to do to get more on your stream?
[03:07.29]I think you have to ready up.
[03:10.01]It's always Mangachu!
[03:11.95]I know!
[03:13.27]I know!
[03:13.65]I was second!
[03:16.45]It's always Mangachu.
[03:17.77]Three, two, one!
[03:22.20]Here we go!
[03:22.86]I've got a couple more seconds.
[03:26.16]Then we wait for the Demoknight!
[03:27.66]Oh my god!
[03:31.02]Oh man.
[03:31.56]Did you see the demo far behind us?
[03:33.86]Yeah, he got launched.
[03:36.70]It's like you don't want us to get all the money.
[03:39.06]Get crit boosted.
[03:41.20]I got all the monies.
[03:42.06]I think they're trying to charge already.
[03:46.37]Oh god, help!
[03:46.93]I'm good.
[03:49.71]There's a tank in this one, right?
[03:52.77]Yes.
[03:53.49]Yep.
[03:54.03]Can't find anything to headshot.
[03:55.53]You guys keep playing it too fast.
[03:57.24]I'm so upset that everything's dying.
[03:59.22]It's not the MVM.
[03:59.76]He's gonna need a pest belt coming down right now.
[04:01.94]Super Scouts.
[04:03.56]He's covering- Oh, he's dead.
[04:04.28]The other one's covering his fist too.
[04:06.84]Oh, there's an engineer back here, engineer back here.
[04:09.78]Texas man, Texas man setting it up!
[04:12.40]Get the Texas man!
[04:14.38]Oh, I see him.
[04:16.61]Where is he?
[04:18.09]He's dead.
[04:19.73]Dead.
[04:20.95]Holy crap, you chew through ammo with this thing.
[04:24.35]Dude, Engi's behind, back left.
[04:25.95]I got him.
[04:28.42]What?
[04:28.96]I got him.
[04:29.74]What?
[04:30.38]What?
[04:31.30]All these scouts are hammering me.
[04:38.83]Superfish!
[04:39.97]Ah, dammit, I'm down.
[04:41.35]There's money top left.
[04:42.57]There's money top left.
[04:43.91]Still, it's gonna go die by.
[04:45.09]Oh, there's a gun top right.
[04:46.93]I got three.
[04:47.51]Oh my god, ow.
[04:49.03]No, there's still 13 on the ground.
[04:50.51]Does anyone see it?
[04:51.69]It's gonna go die by.
[04:52.73]It's gonna go die by.
[04:56.07]Engineer going up the right.
[04:57.33]Top right.
[04:57.77]Oh, he's done.
[04:58.59]Oh, I'm gonna punch him in his face.
[05:00.43]There's a sentry there.
[05:01.43]Is that a last?
[05:02.52]There's a sentry there.
[05:06.20]Nice.
[05:07.04]There's money up by where the sentry is.
[05:08.95]I'm gonna get it.
[05:09.31]There's a teleporter up here too.
[05:10.95]Oh my goodness!
[05:12.27]I got it.
[05:15.59]Is there a tank yet?
[05:17.05]No.
[05:19.33]I'm pretty sure we got this wave.
[05:20.63]I don't think they're gonna get past the sentry.
[05:23.56]There's no more fastcodes, so we should be good.
[05:26.56]Engineer top right.
[05:28.64]He's in the building.
[05:29.52]Tank's still coming.
[05:31.16]Tele's dead.
[05:31.74]And he's fucked up.
[05:34.92]What is this guy doing?
[05:36.34]This engineer's being a weirdo.
[05:37.24]I launched him off.
[05:38.38]Super demo.
[05:41.37]Oh no!
[05:42.09]I got all the medics.
[05:43.57]I got all the medics.
[05:44.83]I got a medic.
[05:46.43]Get those scouts.
[05:48.69]I got my dispenser here for your ammo.
[05:51.89]Oh, I love you.
[05:53.45]Oh god.
[05:54.47]I got destroyed.
[05:55.15]Oh wait, there's one med left.
[05:57.39]Med's down.
[06:01.23]Get the dodge!
[06:02.35]Get the dodge!
[06:06.98]Why would they put the tank at the end?
[06:08.46]Like, too easy.
[06:10.79]Let's go, tank.
[06:13.07]I am here to waste your time.
[06:16.01]I don't know, this isn't looking good.
[06:19.13]This is not looking good, guys.
[06:20.15]I don't think we're gonna do it.
[06:20.83]I got this, I got this.
[06:24.56]Why doesn't the tank have guns?
[06:27.68]That would be too difficult.
[06:29.24]Seems like a design flaw.
[06:31.42]If it was just, like, filled with float-destinator pyros...
[06:36.33]Oh no, please.
[06:38.05]Oh no.
[06:39.71]It'd be pretty cool if you had the chainsaws coming out the side of it.
[06:41.91]Alright, I just got lost in that explosion.
[06:47.67]It's always Mangachu, I swear.
[06:49.15]I'm buying things, please!
[06:52.09]It don't matter why, you're still the last person.
[06:56.01]How many waves?
[06:58.09]I think six.
[06:59.27]We're in the third.
[07:04.41]Danger!
[07:07.00]Danger, DANGERS.
[07:08.89]I ROLLED- I ROLLED DITCH.
[07:10.97]I haven't seen that, but I didn't think you guys knew the song.
[07:13.45]Oh, I'm freakin' dead.
[07:16.97]I'm so good at this.
[07:18.53]You got spy-checked?
[07:20.82]Yeah.
[07:22.90]It's TMP.
[07:24.98]They're holding that button down, I can't even see them.
[07:29.88]I'll just slow this- slow this down.
[07:33.15]Get at me!
[07:34.03]Get at me!
[07:35.37]Get at me!
[07:36.61]okay getting off watch out don't get punched in the face it's too late that was just a conqueror soldier I heard it unless we have one get at me that's definitely a counter soldier I don't know where it went though oh they're all behind us they're going to last are they really we don't have the bomb it doesn't matter okay just don't kill them behind us the top left oh no
[08:01.72]I'm gonna come back.
[08:02.34]Are they still- Oh, my engineer went up top right.
[08:04.22]Engi's behind us.
[08:05.16]It's an uber to engi.
[08:06.86]Oh, you better put down that sentry.
[08:09.54]No, let me get the medic.
[08:12.86]The soldier's not playing me!
[08:14.94]The soldier's not playing us!
[08:17.72]Extended conscious.
[08:19.16]Hey, how come I could hit their sentries with my wrench and it doesn't build them?
[08:23.42]It broke it.
[08:26.57]I have seven health.
[08:28.67]Why did I say that?
[08:30.51]There's money in the left corner.
[08:33.07]I'm going for it.
[08:36.95]I'm trying to kill him.
[08:38.45]Get him!
[08:38.91]Get him!
[08:40.87]The money's more important.
[08:43.03]Okay.
[08:44.71]We lost some money.
[08:47.43]Stabby, you lost it.
[08:48.51]I said it!
[08:51.89]You got blown across the map.
[08:54.95]Thank you for your sacrifice, but I can kind of teleport my sentry.
[09:00.80]I blocked all the damage.
[09:02.34]Oh, heavies.
[09:06.46]Get out of here, man.
[09:07.40]This guy's punching me.
[09:08.26]Get out of here.
[09:08.72]I hella trickstabbed that heavy.
[09:10.03]Hella.
[09:13.25]Sentry buster coming in.
[09:15.53]Yeah.
[09:16.25]I zapped it.
[09:17.03]Oh, god.
[09:22.63]Zapping 62.
[09:23.13]Zapping.
[09:24.69]Zapping.
[09:25.99]Did you call me a Jew?
[09:27.33]I said 62.
[09:27.75]Oh.
[09:31.95]I only have 20 ammo.
[09:32.65]I'm gonna have to stop punching.
[09:37.57]Oh yeah.
[09:38.63]Heyyyy.
[09:39.45]Thirty-eight.
[09:42.88]Danger, danger.
[09:44.40]High voltage.
[09:47.42]Well, guess.
[09:48.58]Well, we're done.
[09:53.28]Destroy projectiles.
[09:55.13]Absolutely.
[09:57.14]I think it's going to help with this one.
[09:58.28]Looks like it's all scouts.
[09:59.26]Yeah, there's no projectiles.
[10:02.77]If you can get knockback, do you know how to work that on heavy?
[10:06.89]I've actually never gotten this far.
[10:08.55]I never play heavy on Manbridge Machine.
[10:09.93]What does it do?
[10:12.04]If you taunt while you're shooting, like revved up and shooting when the bar is full, it starts to knock things back with your bullets.
[10:17.42]And this would be the perfect way for it if they're bonk scouts.
[10:20.50]Can I, uh, I can revert those changes I just did, right?
[10:23.36]If you still need the story, yeah.
[10:25.66]Oh yeah, I absolutely cannot change it.
[10:28.63]Well, then all we need to wait for is Mangachu to ready up.
[10:31.87]No.
[10:33.77]Hey, we'll be alright.
[10:35.81]We'll be fine.
[10:37.49]I got this.
[10:38.05]Wait, they're coming from the same place, right?
[10:40.31]Either the top right, the top left, or the middle thingy.
[10:45.26]Okay.
[10:46.04]Looks like it's top left.
[10:47.42]Oh, FastScout has bomb.
[10:48.74]Do you have Slowjerati?
[10:51.16]but just there's got the top and they got sacked thanks for tank coming up I I my dispensers where it always is yep and jumped up scout up top I know where he's going doubt sorry yet no I love that dispenser for 100 a major play they pop to bra and G's from
[11:20.95]That's so funny that they do that.
[11:22.03]That's like programmed in.
[11:23.93]Uber.
[11:24.15]Yeah.
[11:25.25]He's running away!
[11:26.29]I'll get the dispensers.
[11:26.95]I'm hitting him, I'm hitting him.
[11:27.85]Scout, big scout.
[11:28.83]There's a whole bunch of Engies that are getting up to the top of the Uber.
[11:31.86]Oh goodness.
[11:32.58]Get me a robot.
[11:34.12]Oh god, I'll get him.
[11:35.88]Yeah, they're like way behind us.
[11:37.12]Don't let them set up teleporters or we're done.
[11:38.78]Big scout got the bomb, big scout got the bomb.
[11:43.53]They're behind the... Oh my god!
[11:45.99]Oh, he's got the bomb still!
[11:47.37]He's got like no health!
[11:48.49]Whew!
[11:49.76]Oh my god!
[11:51.18]That was close.
[11:52.42]My sentry shot me.
[11:53.57]I thought the NG whacked me, but no, my sentry got me.
[11:58.17]You guys are playing man versus machine?
[12:00.57]Yeah.
[12:01.77]Aw!
[12:03.31]That's sea bass!
[12:04.39]Why are they looking at the engineers?
[12:10.04]They want to make plays.
[12:12.42]They're like me as engineers.
[12:13.74]Big scout coming in.
[12:16.22]Does he have the bomb?
[12:16.86]He's going for the last!
[12:17.66]Oh, he's gonna get the bomb!
[12:21.86]Noooo!
[12:22.94]Wow, Jerma, wow.
[12:23.66]If he had the pills out by now, you would have killed him.
[12:27.58]God, Jerma.
[12:29.18]What?
[12:29.46]He had 600 HP.
[12:30.51]I wouldn't have gotten him.
[12:31.69]It's six pills.
[12:32.57]I hit one.
[12:33.35]You had to hit four.
[12:34.67]Making sure you sound like someone who's been smoking two packs a day for 30 years.
[12:37.77]I thought it was 80 when I heard my voice.
[12:40.63]You sound like me.
[12:44.13]Somebody said that.
[12:45.45]It's not me this time.
[12:46.63]I'm just gonna have my sentry further back to kill the engineers and to kill the scouts.
[12:50.57]Yeah, we don't even really need it at the beginning.
[12:52.89]Just put it in... I guess you could put it in a spot so we could get wrangled support if you want.
[12:58.56]What do you think should I get?
[13:00.30]Damage or explosive action?
[13:01.92]Here's what we do, Cole.
[13:02.74]Every time you get a 15 killstreak, call in wrangled support and I'll use it.
[13:05.98]Alright.
[13:07.54]Wrangled support.
[13:09.94]Alright, so... I think I'm just going to get more damage.
[13:12.86]Damage is the best.
[13:19.66]It's always fucking Star!
[13:20.38]Hey!
[13:20.46]I'm setting up!

[13:45.67]Hey!
[13:45.75]I'm setting up!
[13:46.12]Hey
[13:49.42]Now there's that lovely dispenser.
[13:50.76]The tank, man.
[13:51.98]Me and you are not doing anything.
[13:56.47]I'm gonna hold back.
[13:57.19]I'm gonna stay back here.
[13:59.03]I just realized I didn't buy anything.
[14:03.59]You guys gotta kill the robots before they go to the end.
[14:06.69]Oh my god!
[14:07.01]Engineer is down.
[14:12.24]Did the scout get there?
[14:13.04]What?
[14:13.18]The scout got by!
[14:13.92]The scout got by!
[14:15.58]Stop!
[14:16.98]I was shot at him the whole way.
[14:18.66]It's just he was at full health.
[14:19.76]I can't do it by myself.
[14:20.68]I didn't have a sapper.
[14:21.90]I shouldn't have saved it.
[14:22.82]Did he go?
[14:23.32]Yeah, he went left.
[14:24.08]I was chasing the engineers.
[14:27.15]That was my job.

[20:05.82]You guys need a medic.
[20:09.98]We need to see that.
[20:11.25]You need to see that, that's right.
[20:15.17]Smoke, I can't even see through the smoke.
[20:20.89]Oh, let's get distracted.
[20:22.95]This tank's getting kind of... anally sphinctered.

[20:58.59]Don't worry about them, they don't have the bomb.
[21:02.21]Oh boy, Engineer.
[21:05.13]I'm just assuming the last tank is at the end.
[21:07.75]Engineer went down.
[21:09.05]What's this tank's health?
[21:14.04]Where the hell is that Engineer?
[21:18.16]He's right here.
[21:19.94]Dude, the Scouts are just hitting me.
[21:22.88]Can anybody see that?

[21:27.00]Scout's right with bomb.
[21:29.95]Bomb, we need to get the tank.
[21:31.51]It's pretty fucking hurt.
[21:35.11]Scout's coming from the right.
[21:36.23]He's coming bridge.
[21:38.25]Yeah, Scout's crossing the bridge right now.

[22:23.03]Which is probably a good way to do it, because, I mean... Do the strat that I gave you, Jeremiah, just in case.
[22:28.07]There is a teleporter top left.
[22:29.13]Oh, I will.
[22:29.33]I'll sit on it.
[22:30.81]Wow.
[22:31.51]That one scout.
[22:32.51]I'm such a buster, guys.
[22:33.79]I'm starstruck.
[22:35.53]Scout's coming on the right.
[22:36.33]Oh, I didn't have enough metal to pull it.
[22:45.20]We need to get that teleporter.
[22:46.12]Yeah, I'll do what you did right now.
[22:52.57]The teleporter.

[22:59.91]Soldier's on the right.
[23:01.62]What?
[23:02.60]I got spy checked.
[23:03.38]I think he shot me.
[23:04.80]I think he might have shot me.
[23:06.54]Spy checking.
[23:09.54]What's left?
[23:10.62]There's one at the top left.
[23:12.12]There's a sentry up on the right.
[23:14.12]That sentry's not going to do a whole lot.
[23:17.00]It's my money and I need it now.
[23:21.40]There's money all the way back right where that engineer was set up.
[23:24.34]Okay.
[23:26.81]What?
[23:27.29]Tag.
[23:28.89]I got the tank as halfway through when you said that.
[23:33.93]I'm sacrificing my life to damage the tank.
[23:37.69]I'm still just going on the right.
[23:38.70]Yeah, there's money that we're losing way back here.
[23:43.96]A lot of it.
[23:44.40]We're not going to be able to get it.
[23:46.43]You missed some of it.
[23:47.73]Oh, whatever.
[23:48.75]You could have probably gotten more of it, but whatever.
[23:51.05]You got this.
[24:02.08]Get back, you foul demons!
[24:08.47]Just the tank, right?
[24:09.63]This is gonna be bad for business.
[24:11.23]And no more soldier.
[24:13.93]Oh, man.
[24:15.66]Shit, there's soldiers behind us.
[24:16.64]I got the soldier.
[24:18.38]I'll get him, I'll get him.
[24:19.14]Let me get him, let me get him.
[24:21.00]I need a head.
[24:21.44]I thought I'm on last.
[24:22.75]Dude, I swear to god.
[24:24.69]Okay.
[24:25.91]It's too fast.
[24:27.37]Oh, okay.
[24:28.81]Get the body.
[24:33.43]Just make sure we focus the Demoman, the engineers we can clean up afterwards.
[24:36.13]He's crit too, I think that's what the blue thing means.
[24:38.31]I'm pretty sure the boss is going to regen health so we don't shoot him.
[24:41.23]That might have just been the heavy though.
[24:43.21]The engineers are coming.
[24:44.69]Instruction workers.
[24:46.17]One engine dead.
[24:48.51]Oh, they finally don't have medics.
[24:49.85]Well, they do drop money.
[24:50.81]What?
[24:50.91]Yeah, they are dropping money.
[24:51.67]The supports are dropping money.
[24:53.07]Money, yeah, engines up top.
[24:55.77]Fuck.
[24:56.53]Your dog was not happy about that.
[24:57.90]Let me get the money top right.
[25:02.16]Please, forget about the money.
[25:03.18]It's not that important.
[25:04.10]Man, the engineers have so much health.
[25:06.14]Here comes the Bonnie.
[25:08.04]The Bonnie?
[25:09.68]Here comes the Bonnie.
[25:15.41]Give me this money.
[25:17.77]Here he is, upright.
[25:19.73]Oh god, soldiers.
[25:21.79]There he is, coming from the place where all the robots come from.
[25:24.47]Oh god!
[25:29.84]Oh my god, he just killed me instantly.
[25:32.12]I'm just gonna outrange him.
[25:38.34]It's the Beggar's Bazooka grenade launcher.
[25:40.76]He's only got 27,000 health.
[25:43.50]Oh my goodness, I'm not even hurting him.
[25:45.89]Oh my god, look at that.
[25:50.19]Even with these crit canteens, this guy is inhaling damage.
[25:56.28]Wow, it's another person who's basically stabby.
[26:00.16]Top left.
[26:00.62]And there's a sentry top left, too.
[26:02.92]Oh, be careful, Star.
[26:05.20]Oh, get it!
[26:08.44]Get him!
[26:14.03]Holy shit, what?
[26:14.99]Oh my god!
[26:15.77]Get the fuck out of here!
[26:19.25]What the fuck?
[26:20.09]Get out of here!
[26:21.11]I was about to buy a rocket and he just flew over me.
[26:23.31]Dude, I just launched that guy.
[26:25.35]That was ridiculous.
[26:27.95]Dude, I think rage might be a little broken.
[26:30.05]There are teleporters everywhere.
[26:34.57]Doesn't matter.
[26:35.11]Oh my god, so many sentries.
[26:37.55]You just gotta rage him again.
[26:38.61]He has like 4000 health.
[26:39.93]He'll be easy to kill.
[26:40.67]I'm dead again.
[26:42.83]We go.
[26:43.97]How did I get up there?
[26:48.39]I'm trying to shoot the projectiles.
[26:50.69]Oh.
[26:51.27]He's almost dead.
[26:51.89]He's almost dead.
[26:52.53]We got this.
[26:52.99]He's dead.
[26:54.47]He's got 2,000.
[26:54.77]Die!
[26:54.87]I actually got him.
[26:58.42]I got the flag.
[27:00.14]Oh, I got my weapon.
[27:01.24]I got my weapon.
[27:01.86]I got a hat.
[27:11.55]Oh, that's... Oh, Cole, you got a... I got a wrench.
[27:16.61]I got a Loose Cannon, fuck yeah.
[27:19.45]Oh my god, cozy camper.
[27:22.92]Nice.
