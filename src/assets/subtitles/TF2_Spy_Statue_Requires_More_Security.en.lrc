[00:10.38]Yay!
[00:10.56]Turn her behind you!
[00:11.31]Behind you!
[00:11.73]Behind you!
[00:26.25]He just got turned on.
[00:28.37]Don't ever come in the museum and start firing a gun scout.
[00:31.73]Don't you know the rules?
[00:33.45]Please help me defend the museum.
[00:34.99]Somebody's trying to steal a painting.
[00:36.43]Somebody... Thank you.
[00:38.48]Thank God I have this security guard on duty.
[00:42.26]I have the security guard on duty protecting the museum spy statue.
[00:48.62]Any more burglars gonna come try and steal me?
[00:52.25]This really is great how this Demoknight is just protecting me.
[00:56.88]Is he gonna... No!
[00:59.28]No!
[01:00.30]Help me!
[01:00.86]No!
[01:08.41]This guy.
[01:08.93]I wonder what he's doing down here.
[01:13.59]Okay, bye.
[01:14.13]Alright.
[01:17.17]Why did he get right in my face?
[01:18.24]He got right in my face.
[01:20.48]And then just decided I wasn't an enemy.
[01:24.86]What is he doing?
[01:26.10]Oh, it's a spy!
[01:28.34]Hey!
[01:29.66]Hey!
[01:37.53]You were too late!
[01:40.25]He stole it!
[01:45.43]How long can the spy statue survive if it's up in a very dangerous place?
[01:50.38]That's my question.
[01:51.96]Like, if it's up here, can it survive?
[01:55.59]Can the spy statue survive if it's in a place like this?
[01:59.75]That's the age-old question.
[02:02.07]I'm kind of in the sniper's way.
[02:03.87]The sniper... The sniper doesn't know.
[02:09.56]He just figured it out.
[02:11.78]He just was like, what the hell?
[02:16.28]Oh, Jesus.
[02:19.06]The way he looked over, he, like, glanced over and was like, oh, shit, what the hell is this?
[02:28.81]Don't you ever touch the spy statue again!
[02:33.74]So, get yourselves ready, security guards.
[02:36.74]This is an expensive statue from, like, the Egyptian times, okay?
[02:40.36]Think about it like that.
[02:42.50]This is the most expensive statue you've ever seen in your life.
[02:46.10]You are tasked with protecting it.
[02:48.94]Yeah, it's like a pharaoh.
[02:50.31]This is like, we got this statue out of King Tut's tomb, alright?
[02:54.49]Are you ready, you attackers?
[02:56.33]Come get the statue.
[02:57.47]Good luck.
[03:02.33]This is so dumb.
[03:07.09]Well, I've lasted more than eight seconds.
[03:10.93]So that's a good thing.
[03:11.83]Uh-oh.
[03:15.79]Have they breached the defenses?
[03:18.26]Oh, he's breaching.
[03:19.02]He's breaching.
[03:19.88]Oh, look out on the right here.
[03:20.88]On the right, on the right, on the right.
[03:23.32]Oh, Jesus.
[03:25.56]No.
[03:25.72]No.
[03:26.90]No.
[03:33.16]Oh, I think we're gonna lose this one.
[03:35.77]Oh, shit.
[03:39.79]It's just me and the two engineers.
[03:40.91]Uh, I don't know.
[03:47.63]I haven't figured that out yet.
[03:50.72]Alright, guys.
[03:53.02]And on the count of three, the attackers are allowed to come in.
[03:55.82]You have 30 seconds in.
[03:56.94]3, 2, 1.
[03:57.00]Try to get the statue.
[03:57.68]30 seconds.
[04:06.91]Looking good so far, boys.
[04:08.82]We're 10 seconds in.
[04:12.44]Uh-oh.
[04:13.04]We got a Bonk Scout.
[04:14.68]We got a Bonk Scout!
[04:16.44]This Bonk Scout might do it!
[04:17.98]Nope.
[04:18.32]Nope.
[04:18.60]Good.
[04:19.16]10 seconds.
[04:19.78]Oh, damn it!
[04:23.36]They had it.
[04:23.76]They got it in 22 seconds.
[04:27.17]This is the museum.
[04:31.49]It's a very nice museum.
[04:32.57]It's like a rundown piece of shit.
[04:35.02]You like this museum?
[04:35.86]It's like a bunch of boards.
[04:38.40]That was a bad... I didn't want to do that.
[04:42.00]Yeah, everybody on blue, get in the secret criminal hideout.
[04:46.50]Get in there!
[04:47.75]Meatball monster, get in there!
[04:49.93]Get in... Get in there!
[04:53.09]Get... Well, he's gone.
[04:56.31]So, look, here's the criminal...
[04:59.53]So stupid looking.
[05:02.01]You guys look like such dipshits.
[05:04.01]I love it.
[05:08.37]Go for it.
[05:10.09]Everybody protect the statue.
[05:16.52]Go, go, go, go, go.
[05:22.52]Yeah, watch this other door.
[05:24.46]The criminals are everywhere.
[05:32.84]Oh, wow.
[05:35.36]Oh, wow.
[05:36.22]That's not good.
[05:37.00]That's not good.
[05:41.30]That's so... Oh, I died.
[05:43.53]I died, like, right at the end there.
[05:47.55]Make sure you do not high-five me, though.
[05:49.27]That's important.
[05:49.83]Okay, there is... Somebody has to stop that before I say go.
[06:01.25]Alright, ready?
[06:01.71]Are you ready, security guards?
[06:03.44]Attackers, attack!
[06:04.58]Come get the statue!
