[00:08.51]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.99]Jerma here with a crate unboxing video.
[00:13.92]I've done one of these in the past, but not really at this scope.
[00:17.80]I did 40 just about a year ago, and now we're going to do 50.
[00:21.45]And I'm going to try and do this in less than 15-20 minutes, because I don't want to sit here and be like, Oh yeah, I got like a spy watch, let me like take a look at that.
[00:28.55]No, we're going to blow through this pretty quickly.
[00:31.19]And...
[00:32.01]Most importantly, if I unbox an unusual in this video, one of you guys is going to get it.
[00:38.98]So we'll cross that bridge if I actually get there or not.
[00:41.86]But okay, here we go.
[00:43.10]Not going to waste any more time.
[00:44.48]We're going to go with crate number 41.
[00:47.82]I'm nervous.
[00:48.42]Here we go.
[00:49.06]Use with 41.
[00:51.75]I'm sure.
[00:52.61]Blow through it, baby.
[00:53.55]Uncrate in your loot.
[00:54.37]What is it?
[00:54.69]Hmm?
[00:55.83]Hmm?
[00:58.41]Strange diamond back.
[00:59.83]Sick.
[01:00.58]Let's go again.
[01:01.94]Not going to waste any time here.
[01:04.08]No, no, no, no.
[01:04.82]I want to do that one.
[01:08.34]No, do it, you idiot.
[01:12.70]I'm sure.
[01:15.05]Three, two, one.
[01:18.89]Strange part, give kills.
[01:20.21]Adding this strange part to a strange quality weapon will enable it to track the number of enemies you give with that weapon.
[01:25.66]Dr. Pepper.
[01:27.92]Moving on.
[01:28.42]No, we still want to create number 41.
[01:31.24]Use with.
[01:32.64]So I got 41, 42, and... 41, 2, 55.
[01:35.36]And then I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 here at the end.
[01:39.34]So we'll see how that goes.
[01:41.14]Yes, I'm sure.
[01:47.43]Strange part.
[01:48.05]Heavy's killed.
[01:50.01]Okay.
[01:51.63]Pretty sick.
[01:57.78]This one's going to be the unusual.
[02:00.82]No, heavy's killed again.
[02:02.00]Heavy's killed again.
[02:04.48]These give me some kind of hat.
[02:13.12]Strange pistol.
[02:14.54]You know, actually, these are kind of... I'm not upset with these.
[02:17.81]I can put these on a lot of different things.
[02:21.43]Use with.
[02:22.59]Go.
[02:24.09]We're almost through row number one.
[02:25.59]Almost through ten here.
[02:29.69]Another strange pistol?
[02:30.57]You gotta be kidding me.
[02:32.83]I'm gonna have enough strange pistols to shove into a bag to send back to Santa Claus.
[02:38.35]That prick.
[02:41.33]Three strange pr-pr-pristols?
[02:43.79]God damn it!
[02:46.49]If I get a strange pistol right here, I'm gonna die.
[02:52.07]Alright, strange detonator.
[02:53.15]That's not bad.
[02:58.74]I'm so, like, nervous right now, it's, like, ridiculous how high my blood pressure is.
[03:05.18]Allies extinguished.
[03:07.44]Allies extinguished would be a pretty big oxymoron.
[03:12.57]Moving on.
[03:12.97]No, we're still in 43?
[03:14.47]Yeah, 43.
[03:18.25]Posthumous kills!
[03:20.45]That's kills after you die.
[03:24.80]That only really works on Pyro, doesn't it?
[03:28.49]Going through the second row.
[03:29.35]Come on, Unusual.
[03:33.46]Straight short stomp.
[03:35.72]I'm liking it.
[03:36.34]I'm liking it.
[03:41.50]I'm liking it.
[03:43.34]What else we got?
[03:45.18]Stout Shaco.
[03:48.38]First hat.
[03:48.86]It only took like almost 15 keys to get to one hat.
[03:58.79]Oh, nice.
[04:00.57]Critical kills.
[04:01.35]Strange part.
[04:01.95]That's awesome.
[04:04.75]That's awesome.
[04:05.56]I like that a lot.
[04:08.92]Crate 44.
[04:09.74]The series of 44.
[04:13.20]Critical kills again.
[04:14.18]I can use that on multiple items.
[04:18.62]Unusual.
[04:19.00]The unusual is going to be right here.
[04:20.10]I'm not even going to look.
[04:24.60]Oh, strange rocket launcher.
[04:26.32]That's a beauty.
[04:29.05]That's a real beaut.
[04:33.27]Almost through 20.
[04:36.27]Strange rocket launcher again.
[04:37.61]Alright.
[04:41.21]Come on.
[04:41.46]I want to give an unusual away.
[04:42.96]Let's get like a burning team captain right now.
[04:48.76]Revenge kills.
[04:49.42]That's pretty sick.
[04:54.12]Alright.
[04:54.38]What do we got in this one?
[04:59.33]Oh!
[05:05.07]I got an unusual!
[05:06.27]I got an unusual!
[05:09.01]Alright, so... Oh, man!
[05:12.87]So what's gonna happen here is... In the comments section of... I can't believe it!
[05:17.16]I got an unusual Hustlers Hallmark smoking.
[05:20.12]In the comments section of this video, I'm picking a random person, and you're getting this hat.
[05:26.35]That's awesome.
[05:27.91]And I'm not even halfway through yet.
[05:30.83]Oh, man.
[05:32.13]Sick.
[05:33.23]I'm so glad that somebody's going to get that hat.
[05:35.49]I can't tell you how happy I am right now, guys.
[05:38.03]Hopefully I get another one.
[05:41.30]Again, random person in the comment section is going to get this hat.
[05:46.90]So leave a comment.
[05:48.52]Doesn't matter what it is, as long as you don't spam.
[05:51.14]Because if you write more than one comment to try and get this hat...
[05:54.82]I'm going to be pissed.
[05:55.71]So don't do that.
[05:57.03]Let's keep going.
[05:57.61]Let's go.
[05:57.97]Let's go.
[05:58.49]Let's go, baby.
[06:02.55]Another one.
[06:02.99]Right after the other.
[06:04.79]Strange Persian Persuader.
[06:05.83]That's cool.
[06:11.42]Uncreating your loot.
[06:13.62]God, I'm so happy about that.
[06:16.65]Strange Scotsman Skullcutter.
[06:22.11]My mood just elevated so much right there.
[06:25.55]Crate number 45 series.
[06:26.99]Actually, we've done a few 45s.
[06:31.18]Kills while explosive jumping.
[06:35.12]Kind of cool.
[06:35.88]I guess I'll take it.
[06:38.60]Oh, how sick would it be if I could give away two Unusuals?
[06:40.80]Come on, give me another Unusual.
[06:44.75]Out of the 45s now.
[06:45.83]We're moving on to the 47s after this one.
[06:49.85]Strange skull cutter again.
[06:51.51]Look at that thing.
[06:56.84]Look at that beautiful hat.
[07:01.04]Backwards ball cap.
[07:02.42]Awesome.
[07:03.00]Awesome.
[07:03.36]Awesome.
[07:03.66]Awesome.
[07:03.86]I'm glad I got that now.
[07:06.48]Dr. Pepper Burps.
[07:11.23]Can we do two?
[07:12.31]Is that going to happen?
[07:15.57]Strange force of nature.
[07:19.33]It's alright.
[07:20.67]I'll take that with the bank.
[07:22.44]And then cash the bank.
[07:25.66]Ooh.
[07:29.24]Daddy like.
[07:30.50]Daddy like.
[07:33.41]Just about halfway through.
[07:34.43]Just about halfway through, guys.
[07:38.43]Another hat.
[07:39.03]I'll take it.
[07:39.99]Sniper's Professional's Panama.
[07:42.13]Wait, Panama?
[07:42.83]Yeah.
[07:43.24]Panama.
[07:43.46]Panama.

[08:32.09]Oh yeah, baby!

[09:02.09]Let's go.
[09:05.48]Strange scattergun again.
[09:06.70]Getting down to the wire here.
[09:09.90]Getting down to the wire here, boys and girls and animals.
[09:14.32]If you're watching, if any animals are watching this video, engineers killed again.
[09:17.34]Strange part.
[09:19.93]I don't know if I like that very much because engineer is like my favorite class.
[09:26.94]Alright, we're in crate series like the newer ones.
[09:29.48]We're in 54 and 55 right now.
[09:33.12]Strange sniper rifle.
[09:34.58]Hell yeah.
[09:41.59]54.
[09:41.61]55.
[09:41.81]Another unusual.
[09:45.43]Ooh.
[09:46.39]Yes.
[09:47.25]Yes.
[09:47.83]Yes.
[09:49.39]I like it.
[09:53.05]Nerves are getting a little crazy here, guys.
[09:54.63]Getting a little amped up right now.
[09:57.61]What the hell is that?
[09:59.49]Surgeon's side satchel.
[10:04.23]What the hell?
[10:04.61]Alright, when I just put this drink down, I just splashed it all over the screen.
[10:07.67]So, whatever.
[10:08.21]I can't even, like, see.
[10:09.47]That must be miscellaneous for the medic.
[10:13.32]Getting down here.
[10:14.10]This is the last little bit.
[10:20.16]Hottie's hoodie.
[10:21.62]I'm getting a lot of hats.
[10:23.80]Getting a lot of hats.
[10:27.92]Hottie's hoodie.
[10:28.40]Come on, come on, come on.
[10:29.70]Let me get an unusual Hottie's hoodie right now.
[10:33.38]Kills while ubercharged.
[10:34.74]That's a good one.
[10:37.64]Sweet.
[10:39.52]Almost out of crate 54.
[10:41.48]Moving on to 55.
[10:42.38]And then we got five special crates.
[10:46.10]Another strange sniper rifle.
[10:49.32]That's good trade bait right there.
[10:50.72]That's good trade bait.
[10:56.65]Pyro's killed, strange part.
[11:00.41]Alright.
[11:04.31]55.
[11:04.33]55.
[11:09.42]Strange Medigun.
[11:11.40]Really?
[11:12.66]Hold on a second.
[11:13.56]Wait, Strange Medigun is in crate 55?
[11:17.20]I thought it was in crate 30.
[11:18.04]Oh, wow.
[11:18.42]Okay, cool.
[11:22.42]Cool!
[11:24.13]Cool!
[11:26.87]Almost through the 55 series.
[11:30.30]Pyro's killed again.
[11:31.24]Are we going to get another Unusual?
[11:34.48]So I can give away two.
[11:36.60]We'll see.
[11:39.94]Strange Medigun again.
[11:41.08]Alright, this is the last one for the newer crates.
[11:45.70]Then we're going to move on to crate number one.
[11:51.79]Oh, Babyface's Blast is Strange.
[11:55.41]I didn't know they even had that strange.
[11:58.13]Alright, so the final five keys are going to be for crate series one, two, three, four, and five.
[12:05.04]I don't even think you can get strangers out of these crates.
[12:08.24]We'll see what happens.
[12:09.10]Here we go.
[12:10.08]Crate series... No, no, no.
[12:11.06]We're going to go backwards.
[12:12.58]Crate series number five.
[12:14.15]We'll start with that one.
[12:15.23]We'll do one last.
[12:17.51]Crate series five.
[12:18.15]Here we go.
[12:24.16]The regular Power Jack.
[12:26.74]Oh, wow.
[12:29.28]Crate series number four.
[12:30.84]Yeah, these aren't... I don't think strangers were even introduced until, what, crate series 20?
[12:34.87]22 or something?
[12:37.11]Oh, nice.
[12:37.49]I got, like, a white paint to paint my, like, new unusual that's being given away.
[12:42.91]Crate series number three.
[12:44.75]Getting down to the final three crates.
[12:50.42]The Bushwhacker.
[12:52.61]Oh man, these were not worth opening.
[12:54.04]I'm not even getting strangers for this.
[12:56.76]Oh, when I say that, it's going to be worth it right here.
[12:59.16]It's going to be worth it right here.
[13:04.92]Final Key.
[13:06.38]Final Crate.
[13:07.12]Series number one.
[13:08.70]The first crate series they ever introduced.
[13:11.07]And it's going to get us an unusual right now.
[13:12.59]Here we go.
[13:18.05]Oh, it's the old Guadaladrara.

[13:45.92]Unbelievable.
[13:46.48]I'm so happy.
[13:47.77]When I did this, when I thought of doing this again, because when I did it last time, I did not get an unusual with 40 crates.
[13:54.09]So I thought, I'm going to give myself a better chance this time with 50.
[13:58.66]And I got one.
[13:59.42]So congratulations to whoever gets picked for that hat.
