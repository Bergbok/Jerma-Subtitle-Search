[00:08.96]I need to wait for you to disable that camcorder.
[00:14.72]Take out that camcorder!
[00:16.34]Hold on!
[00:17.88]Figure it out!
[00:18.46]There's a lot more to hacking than there is walking down an alley and getting caught.
[00:24.39]My screen is four different windows of views, and each one has a tutorial on it right now.
[00:30.67]Put the pager.
[00:31.57]Martin can lure enemies away from their post by calling a throne pager.
[00:34.97]A throne pager.
[00:37.91]So apparently I can throw this pager and this guy's gonna go get it?
[00:44.54]Can you make that thing buzz?
[00:48.12]Oh, shit.
[00:49.18]You just did that, okay?
[00:50.44]Yeah, I just called it.
[00:52.76]So I just sprint by this guy?
[00:54.58]Yeah, go.
[00:56.05]Oh, he turned.
[00:56.59]It's okay.
[00:58.71]Is he still turning?
[01:02.13]I think he's fine.
[01:04.92]Stop calling that.
[01:06.80]Stop that.
[01:11.79]Stop.
[01:14.61]Okay.
[01:15.17]You just.
[01:15.59]No.
[01:15.95]No, you idiot.
[01:17.23]You like.
[01:19.51]No, that was you walking around.
[01:21.07]You are hammering my brain.
[01:25.28]Is there a computer in the room?
[01:26.60]Yes.
[01:27.04]Then plug me in.
[01:27.90]I'll see about getting you the code.
[01:29.96]Oh, well, there's a gun in here too.
[01:32.72]Hey, plug me in.
[01:35.05]Plug me in!
[01:36.07]Oh fuck, was that the computer we were supposed to use?
[01:42.29]No, there's three people in here.
[01:45.08]They'll all hear you.
[01:47.98]Throw your fucking pager!
[01:49.06]I don't have my pager anymore.
[01:57.02]Oh, no.
[01:57.78]I'm running.
[01:59.96]I'm running.
[02:00.76]I'm running.
[02:01.10]They don't see me.
[02:02.48]No, they're... He's hurt.
[02:03.58]He's running towards your door.
[02:04.76]He's running towards your door.
[02:05.60]Are you serious?
[02:06.50]He's about to go through the door.
[02:07.42]He's walking through the door.
[02:08.38]Just sneak over here.
[02:09.74]His pathing is bad.
[02:10.71]He couldn't do it.
[02:11.29]No, he's coming.
[02:12.77]He's coming.
[02:13.09]Oh, shit.
[02:13.47]I'm hiding.
[02:13.75]I'm hiding.
[02:14.11]I'm hiding.
[02:14.99]I'm hiding.
[02:16.53]He's in.
[02:17.63]He's not gonna find me.
[02:18.27]He's about to turn the corner.
[02:18.95]You gotta shoot him.
[02:19.55]You gotta shoot him.
[02:20.39]You're gonna have to.
[02:25.15]No one heard that.
[02:27.75]You're clear to go, Ghost Rider?
[02:30.03]Alright, thanks a lot, Tango Bango.
[02:34.28]He's coming up the stairs.
[02:36.34]He's coming, dude.
[02:37.88]Shoot him in the fucking face.
[02:39.05]Hold on.
[02:39.45]Page him!
[02:39.89]Page him!
[02:40.31]Page him!
[02:40.69]Page him!
[02:44.77]Page it.
[02:45.73]Page.
[02:46.30]I did.
[02:46.64]I paged them.
[02:47.36]Keep doing it.
[02:48.02]There's three of them.
[02:49.70]Just keep paging it.
[02:51.28]Just page.
[02:55.27]Page.
[02:55.81]Page quick.
[02:56.99]I'm paging.
[02:58.37]Making a break.
[02:59.01]Making a break for it.
[03:01.23]Can I please stand the fuck up?
[03:02.33]That'd be great.
[03:02.81]Stand up.
[03:07.82]I saw you peek at the big camera.
[03:09.90]He's coming around.
[03:10.40]He's coming around.
[03:11.34]Figured it out.
[03:11.80]Right here.
[03:12.16]No, he's looking out the ocean.
[03:13.08]You can snap his neck.
[03:14.29]Snap his neck.
[03:15.31]He turned.
[03:15.61]He heard you walk.
[03:17.61]No.
[03:18.13]Hide.
[03:18.73]Where am I hiding?
[03:19.71]Is he going to go... What the fuck was that?
[03:21.57]You scared the shit out of me.
[03:23.03]What'd you do?
[03:25.97]What happened?
[03:26.83]What did you do?
[03:32.07]What?
[03:32.77]Oh, God.
[03:34.39]You gotta keep an eye on these cameras.
[03:36.85]Oh, I... There's three people coming for you.
[03:39.19]Oh, come on.
[03:39.87]Run, run, run.
[03:41.07]Where am I running to?
[03:43.17]Right, right.
[03:44.09]I don't know where to run to.
[03:45.01]Right.
[03:47.39]I forgot to hide in here.
[03:48.05]Stop there, stop there, stop there.
[03:49.09]There's a guy coming in for you.
[03:51.67]He's marked three.
[03:53.17]Three people are coming in here right now.
[03:54.67]No, he's marked as three.
[03:55.69]He's close.
[03:56.29]Three is close to you.
[03:58.47]They're walking away.
[03:59.25]They're all walking away.
[04:00.11]By the way, I'm holding down G. I have to let go of this and throw this at some point.
[04:05.51]I can't let go of this.
[04:07.49]I can't.
[04:08.57]I can't.
[04:09.67]Well, open the door and just throw it that way.
[04:12.09]I can't.
[04:12.67]Oh, no.
[04:14.07]I have to let go of G to open the door with E, so I'm going to flashbang myself.
[04:20.69]Well, two is right there.
[04:22.08]You might as well flashbang two.
[04:25.14]I can't even open the door.
[04:27.00]I'm stuck in here.
[04:30.62]What?
[04:30.94]What?
[04:40.13]Can I take... Okay, give me hammer.
[04:45.87]God, I want a hammer so bad.
[04:47.77]I don't know.
[04:48.20]How would you not know I'm behind you?
[04:50.28]He's trying to reach for your desk hammer.
[04:53.02]Yeah, I'm trying to get his hammer off his desk.
[04:55.62]He's still... Are you serious, dude?
[04:57.44]This is your old mobile.
[05:08.87]Oh god, what the fuck?
[05:13.50]What?
[05:15.42]What?
[05:15.66]Alright, hold on.
[05:20.26]Hack his computer?
[05:21.02]Well, he's on it.
[05:23.28]I'm already hacked his computer.
[05:24.84]I'm on his computer.
[05:26.72]I'm looking at his emails.
[05:29.29]Okay, let me browse.
[05:30.91]Let me hold your mouse and browse your emails.
[05:34.12]Oh, thanks, dude.
[05:34.90]I appreciate it.
[05:36.16]He's going for the desk hammer!
[05:37.10]Shoot!
[05:37.34]Shoot!
[05:37.52]Is he going for the desk hammer?
[05:38.70]He's going for the desk hammer.
[05:43.88]It was self-defense.
[05:44.93]Okay.
[05:47.03]So there's a guy here.
[05:48.03]If I can get three, and at least the guy next to three.
[05:50.99]Mark the guy next to three, because I'm going to flash him.
[05:53.61]I could only have three marked at a time, so that's why.
