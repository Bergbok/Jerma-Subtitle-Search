[00:01.38]Hello everybody.
[00:02.40]Hi.
[00:06.76]We are live, yes we are.
[00:09.74]Sorry, I have to move over here to my, to my battle station.
[00:12.80]I had to set my microphone and cameras up for this stream, and we're all set.
[00:25.45]Go back offline.
[00:30.84]That's the second day in a row.
[00:32.42]Okay.
[00:32.96]That's the second day in a row that I have read within 30 seconds of the stream starting.
[00:39.91]Somebody say, fuck out of here.
[00:42.85]Turn off your stream.
[00:43.69]And I go, turn off my stream.
[00:44.67]What are you talking about, man?
[00:45.89]What?
[00:48.83]I don't know why.
[00:49.37]I have no idea.
[00:51.09]Anyways, today is going to be sort of a fun stream.
[00:54.57]I hope.
[00:55.81]It depends on how good Joel and I are at communicating instructions.
[01:02.10]We're going to keep talking and nobody explodes.
[01:09.56]I have, well, I'll just show you.
[01:12.90]Well, hold on.
[01:15.04]Joel just started the stream too, so let's let people trickle in for a little bit.
[01:18.91]Make sure I got my coffee in the right place.
[01:21.29]Here, one sec.
[02:15.51]All right, so take a look at my setup here.
[02:19.67]Set over here.
[02:22.22]Well, the stream is not over, don't worry.
[02:25.52]So I've got for you here my battle station.
[02:31.70]I printed this shit out.
[02:32.92]I'm ready to go.
[02:34.42]I'm not messing around.
[02:36.20]I've got my guide, as you see.
[02:40.05]Bomb defusal manual.
[02:41.61]I've just got to lean over a little.
[02:44.31]I am ready.
[02:45.45]I told you I was taking this fucking dead serious.
[02:48.39]Dead serious today.
[02:51.55]And you can see, look at this.
[02:52.67]Take a look at this.
[02:54.29]You can actually read along with me if you want to.
[02:59.18]That's good.
[03:00.28]Looks like it's not blocking the way.
[03:02.82]There's my bomb defusal manual.
[03:05.02]Joel has one of these too.
[03:07.02]So wait, you can't even hear the music.
[03:08.10]There we go.
[03:11.12]Joel has one of these too.
[03:13.89]We did a trial run before the stream turned on and we did all right.
[03:20.37]We did okay.
[03:23.79]Shave.
[03:24.17]Get out of here.
[03:30.78]How can you even tell?
[03:31.68]How can you even tell?
[03:33.20]I have like a spooky ghost light on me.
[03:38.08]How can you tell that I need to shave?
[03:40.08]It just looks like a little bit of scrub.
[03:42.52]How can you tell?
[03:47.63]It looked like Jesus.
[03:53.23]If Jesus was around today, he'd have the most followed Twitter account, so that's okay with me.
[03:57.42]He's a pretty fucking big deal.
[04:00.88]All right, so let's see.
[04:01.72]Is Joel ready?
[04:02.20]I'm gonna... Is this stream on?
[04:17.18]He just went BRB.
[04:21.71]Wait, hold on, his stream is not on?
[04:23.63]Yes it is.
[04:27.32]What are you talking about?
[04:28.76]His stream's not turned on?
[04:30.12]That, no, he's on, he's on, he's on.
[04:35.16]See?
[04:45.43]We have to do the squad stream thing because we're going to have two different... When I'm doing the bomb stuff, he's going to be talking and it's going to be... Our screens are going to be completely different.
[04:58.45]Oh, he left the call.
[04:59.49]Why did he leave the call?
[05:02.55]Important question.
[05:03.57]Who is a better music producer?
[05:05.55]I don't know who any of... Either of those people are.
[05:08.19]I have no idea.
[05:11.75]Alright, what was he doing?
[05:13.99]Joe, what are you up to?
[05:22.81]See, this is my own, all right, let me tell you something.
[05:24.45]This is my own damn fault.
[05:25.94]This is my own fault.
[05:29.00]When I start a stream, I'm just like, start, I have an intro screen and the intro screen plays, right?
[05:34.90]And then I sit there for one minute and then I go, okay, time starts streaming now.
[05:40.49]I'm like, time to go, let's go.
[05:42.19]I don't give any fucking time.
[05:45.01]And some, I always just, like two, not even two minutes will go by.
[05:50.71]I just sit there because, yeah, ADHD.
[05:53.26]It just takes over my whole body because I'm looking at, I'm here.
[05:56.48]I'm just here and I'm seeing the screen.
[05:57.96]I'm seeing people chatting.
[05:58.84]I'm just going like, I want to, let's go.
[06:03.64]I'm like a fucking five-year-old.
[06:12.39]What is that thing in your camera?
[06:13.65]What are you talking about?
[06:15.67]The thing on my camera?
[06:23.02]What?
[06:25.20]What thing?
[06:28.50]That 5.6 thing.
[06:30.08]5.7.
[06:30.24]Don't fucking get it wrong.
[06:32.42]That thing.
[06:33.75]Oh, this thing.
[06:35.01]This is this camera.
[06:37.77]This is this camera.
[06:40.39]I have like a periscope.
[06:46.35]This is one of those scenarios where, like, I'm gonna fall down on this stream, and this is gonna go through my fucking eye.
[06:53.07]It's like... Everyone's now going, oh, please don't do that.
[07:04.07]Oh, he... Okay, he's almost ready.
[07:06.69]He's almost ready.
[07:13.02]You spoiled the joke.
[07:14.96]Me putting my head through is... What do you mean a joke?
[07:17.51]That would be a disaster.
[07:19.15]That would be a horrible thing that would happen to me.
[07:20.47]Alright, look.
[07:24.77]Alright, here you go.
[07:25.67]Alright, hold on.
[07:28.40]I'm gonna be... I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
[08:00.96]You know when you wait for the bus, and you got there way too early, and you realize that the next bus is coming in like 30 minutes, and you go, fuck.
[08:14.38]I mean, I kind of have to, I mean, this is the way that I am when the buses come.
[08:20.64]I'm walking around, just looking at stuff.
[08:22.48]You look at the same ad on the side of the bus stop like a thousand times.
[08:29.62]You just pace around, you're like, alright, that bus will be here in 30 minutes.
[08:35.10]My phone, ah, my phone's not even interesting.
[08:37.72]I hate that shit.
[08:38.83]When even your, when your phone is not interesting, that's when it's the worst waiting.
[08:43.87]You can't, you can't even open up your phone and do anything because it's like, nothing on this phone is interesting.
[08:49.78]I've already seen these tweets a thousand times.
[08:51.90]I've been to Reddit twice.
[09:01.06]I wrote 25 comments.
[09:09.82]I hate waiting.
[09:13.04]Hey Jervis, so don't we when you're late all the fucking time.
[09:20.85]Oh, shit.
[09:23.81]Oh, I got myself.
[09:26.15]I fell in my own trap there.
[09:28.39]I stepped on a rake in the backyard and it hit me right in the fucking face.
[09:34.95]I don't have front teeth anymore.
[09:36.19]Alright.
[09:43.00]Let's fucking go.
[10:06.68]And then... When the bus actually shows up... When the bus shows up... Oh, hold on.
[10:12.14]I'm sorry.
[10:12.38]I'm going over something.
[10:14.60]All right.
[10:15.20]When the bus actually shows up and you look at the top text on the bus and it's not for where you're fucking going.
[10:21.73]It's the complete opposite side of town.
[10:23.63]And you're like, God damn it.
[10:25.03]I have to wait for like another 20 minutes.
[10:26.27]I thought it was 30.
[10:26.69]All right.
[10:26.99]How you doing?
[10:27.99]You ready?
[10:29.15]Yeah, I'm good.
[10:30.75]I'm good to go.
[10:32.09]You ready to defuse some bombs?
[10:34.47]I hope so.
[10:36.16]Yeah, me too.
[10:36.58]So what do you want?
[10:38.50]You want to go first?
[10:39.80]How do you want to do this?
[10:40.84]You fucking read.
[10:41.56]I'll read first.
[10:43.60]Listen, I'm not self-deprecating, but I'm saying, like, if I start fucking reading manuals right now, I might as well be reading a fucking Arby's menu.
[10:52.23]All right?
[10:53.49]I'm not going to get shit done.
[10:55.05]You have to read.
[10:55.65]I have to do this.
[10:56.47]Okay.
[10:57.79]I think I can handle it.
[10:59.59]All right, here we go.
[11:00.85]We did do this once.
[11:02.59]And God damn it, this is going to hurt me.
[11:04.57]All right.
[11:06.28]And that's all I, this is a gun pointing at me.
[11:09.48]Ugh.
[11:10.00]This is a gun pointing at me.
[11:11.52]Listen, the core principle of defusing bombs or like handling stuff under pressure, I've come to learn that you can always rely on chat.
[11:20.44]chat yes always knows how to handle these situations chat is should it really be the bomb experts in this case uh so what we're gonna do in case this gets a little hard you guys have to spit instructions at us and I'm sure that with your expertise and and and our lack of we're gonna have an excellent stream that's not gonna be going down as the worst stream of 2020 already so um uh you ready to do this
[11:45.29]Let's hope for... Hey, look, Joel, we're starting all the way at the bottom.
[11:50.37]We're starting at the bottom.
[11:52.23]So there's no way this could be the worst stream of 2020.
[11:55.43]Like, as long as this is even 5% better than the Halo... Jeremiah, this is already the worst stream we've ever done.
[12:00.13]Alright, are you ready?
[12:06.08]I'm fucking ready.
[12:06.80]I'm ready too.
[12:07.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[12:07.72]We have to squad stream.
[12:09.76]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:11.16]We got to, you know.
[12:12.56]Guys, people are only going to see the manual on mine.
[12:17.99]Let's see here.
[12:20.79]Somebody checked this goes, worst stream of the 21st century.
[12:27.36]all right I invited you to a squad stream squad up so what will happen is you're gonna get you're gonna get you're gonna get two twitch screens on both channels and you're gonna get to choose which one you want to screens or screams all right you get it yeah I'm ready to go all right it says invite send are we even squads yeah are we always squatting up are we let's going uh I don't know if I see it but are you guys seeing it do you guys see

[13:00.26]Fuck.
[13:01.66]No?
[13:02.08]What do you mean no?
[13:06.06]Listen, guys, we're trying to defuse bombs here.
[13:08.56]All right.
[13:08.84]All right, you send me an invite.
[13:11.58]Okay.
[13:17.65]You know what's the funniest thing?
[13:18.67]Sometimes when I try to, like, I just want to, like, send you tweets or whatever stuff, I forget what your name is.
[13:25.70]Like, I know your name's like Bob or whatever, but the thing is, like, you have these three last numbers.
[13:30.78]I'm just like, Jerma 900.
[13:32.42]Jerma 800.
[13:33.64]Like... Alright, let's fucking go, Joel.
[13:37.39]I'm ready.
[13:37.75]Alright.
[13:39.07]We're squatted up.
[13:41.97]Alright, I'm gonna turn off this monitor.
[13:44.31]You got control, right?
[13:46.54]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:47.52]Alright, monitor off.
[13:49.86]I'm ready to give you instructions.
[13:51.29]You fucking ready to do this?
[13:52.53]Are you fucking ready for the stream of 2020?
[13:54.93]To define the 20s.
[13:55.51]The roaring 20s.
[13:57.31]All right.
[13:58.49]If you don't know how this game works, we have five minutes to defuse a bomb where I can't see what he's doing.
[14:04.79]I have to give him instructions on what he has to do.
[14:07.83]And he can't see anything.
[14:09.62]Just open the fucking game.
[14:12.98]I can hear.
[14:13.62]All right.
[14:14.18]Hold on.
[14:14.42]Should I mute this?
[14:16.51]No, does that matter?
[14:17.33]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[14:19.59]Oh, no, no, right, right.
[14:21.31]I just, I was taking control of the game.
[14:23.03]All right.
[14:23.59]Listen, listen, I, I, I'm on Jeremiah's computer.
[14:26.59]I get to see all the desktop porn, all right?
[14:28.35]Listen, feel sorry for me.
[14:30.49]I didn't give you access to the fucking keyboard, so, uh.
[14:32.53]You sure about that?
[14:35.45]I hope not.
[14:38.67]Listen, do not look at the screen.
[14:39.83]I will do this.
[14:40.61]I got, I got, I got like my, my last like six years of tax returns on my desktop.
[14:45.08]Don't fucking show it.
[14:47.06]All right, well, maybe fucking tell me instructions and we won't have to fucking show that on stream.
[14:50.22]All right, here we go.
[14:51.08]Let's kick some ass.
[14:51.78]All right, Jeremiah, you ready to read?
[14:55.10]Yes.
[14:55.92]All right.
[14:56.38]Okay.
[14:56.68]What do you got?
[14:58.08]Okay, so we've got a yellow wire, a white wire, a red wire, and a blue wire.
[15:02.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:03.94]Modules.
[15:04.32]Okay.
[15:04.92]On the subject of wires.
[15:06.04]How many wires are there?
[15:07.78]There are four wires.
[15:08.90]Four wires.
[15:09.41]Okay.
[15:10.79]Uh...
[15:11.69]Is there, are there any red wires?
[15:13.53]There's one red wire.
[15:14.71]Okay, is there more than, is there two red wires?
[15:17.83]There's, there's one, just one color.
[15:19.64]There's one yellow, one white, one red, one blue.
[15:22.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:22.74]Okay, wait, hold on.
[15:24.62]No, don't argue.
[15:26.28]Don't argue.
[15:27.02]I can hear the noise and it's freaking me out.
[15:28.44]All right.
[15:29.26]If there, how many, wait, is the last wire yellow?
[15:32.90]No, I need to talk to you.
[15:34.55]All right, hold on.
[15:37.47]There's no red wires.
[15:39.08]There's one red... I fucking said that!
[15:41.54]There's only one red wire.
[15:43.30]There's one red wire!
[15:44.48]Okay, alright.
[15:45.90]Is the last wire yellow?
[15:48.44]No, it's blue.
[15:49.26]Okay.
[15:50.39]Is there one blue wire?
[15:52.37]There's... Is there one blue wire?
[15:54.37]I'm gonna fucking come over to Boston and I'm gonna fucking... I don't even live there anymore, man!
[15:58.19]Alright, I... Well, I'm fucking... Alright, is there one... Yes or no, is there one blue wire?
[16:05.81]Third fucking time, blue wire!
[16:06.97]Say it!
[16:07.49]Say it!
[16:07.75]Is it one blue?
[16:08.23]Okay, then cut... There's one blue wire!
[16:10.25]Cut the first wire.
[16:11.13]Cut the first wire.
[16:16.55]Did you cut it?
[16:17.69]Yeah, yeah.
[16:18.34]I'm... I don't know how to... Okay, what's next?
[16:20.88]What else?
[16:21.10]What else?
[16:21.30]What else?
[16:22.34]Okay, so then we have a second module.
[16:25.58]It's a keypad-looking thing, right?
[16:26.94]Keypad-looking thing.
[16:28.34]Right.
[16:28.74]With the symbols?
[16:30.02]The first one is like an X with a little schadoodle underneath it.
[16:32.93]Okay.
[16:34.11]X with a little...
[16:35.78]Just go, okay.
[16:37.52]It's like a really badly looking K or an X. Okay, it's a bad K. With a skadoodle underneath it.
[16:43.15]It's a bad K with a skadoodle underneath.
[16:44.99]It's like a cursive kind of looking K. It's not an X. Is it an H?
[16:49.83]Does it look like an H?
[16:51.43]Yeah, you could say that.
[16:52.59]Yeah, sure.
[16:53.55]Okay, what else?
[16:56.35]Then you have an upside-down question mark.
[16:58.33]Upside-down question mark, okay.
[16:59.07]And then you have a drooling O. Wait, wait, wait.
[17:02.51]Could that also be an upside-down 9-2?
[17:07.19]Uh, no.
[17:08.62]I don't see any upside-down question marks here.
[17:10.34]Oh, actually, yes, I do!
[17:11.06]Okay, all right.
[17:11.46]What else?
[17:11.68]What else?
[17:11.90]What else?
[17:12.70]Just rifle, rifle, rifle, rifle.
[17:13.58]I'm drooling O. On O, that's drooling.
[17:15.52]Okay, yup.
[17:15.98]What else?
[17:17.10]Okay, and then you have a backwards E with two dots.
[17:20.72]It's like a Swede wrote an E. Okay, all right.
[17:24.66]Press the backwards E first.
[17:28.24]Okay, then the drooling O. And then the H with the squiggly.
[17:34.98]And then the upside down question mark.
[17:36.70]We got it.
[17:37.52]Is that it?
[17:38.08]What else?
[17:40.06]That's pretty much it.
[17:40.62]What do you mean that's it?
[17:41.83]Why is it still ticking?
[17:44.65]You got the big old button.
[17:45.91]Big old button.
[17:49.45]Alright.
[17:50.33]Follow these rules in the order that they are listed.
[17:51.79]Perform the first action that applies.
[17:53.63]What color is the button?
[17:54.48]White.
[17:57.41]It's a white button, okay.
[17:58.67]Yeah, we have less than a f- Just a minute now.
[18:01.39]Alright, so if the button is white, and there is a lit indicator with a lit- What does it say on it?
[18:06.90]Abort.
[18:07.72]It says abort.
[18:08.20]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:09.76]Uh, if there's- Feels like I'm overdue to the stream.
[18:11.84]If there's- If the button is yellow, if the button is red, and the button says hold- If none of them apply, hold the button and refer to releasing.
[18:16.85]Wait, so... Where's abort?
[18:19.55]Does it say abort anywhere?
[18:21.37]How much time do I have?
[18:21.97]It's on the fucking button.
[18:22.83]On the- it's in bright fucking Las Vegas letters.
[18:24.91]Okay, alright.
[18:25.31]Blinking at me.
[18:25.89]Okay, alright.
[18:26.62]Why- why is like stuff coming up?
[18:27.76]Okay.
[18:28.28]Hold the button down.
[18:29.68]Okay.

[38:10.63]No he's not.
[38:12.47]What happened?
[38:13.13]He's a gamer.
[38:17.46]I don't understand.
[38:21.63]That's so fucking... I don't know what happened.
[38:24.79]Listen, what's the ratio of dumbness here, right?
[38:27.07]Listen, listen.
[38:28.13]What's the ratio of dumbness?
[38:30.06]Like, alright, alright.
[38:32.06]If we're on a seesaw thing, right?
[38:34.22]Where's the dumbness our way?
[38:35.78]A seesaw?
[38:40.26]you don't know what a seesaw is I know what a seesaw is but what like that's not there's only two seats let's let's say we have animals for heads right that represents dumbness all right we both sing at each side of the the the seesaw which dumbness like outweighs the other side tips over you know what I mean oh I see what you're saying like you're talking a scale a scale uh we're both sitting like our brains are both being weighed on the scale which who has the heavier brain okay um
[39:08.35]I don't know that's for the audience to decide not me they balance each other it's just even at zero all right we're gonna get this one because this is all right we're not gonna get embarrassed his thing though here's the thing what you don't understand is like germ and I are what is commonly referred to as uh liars um it's a bit of an incorrect term here really but
[39:35.97]We've been putting on a show for you guys because we know that if we breeze through everything here and we didn't entertain you guys with failed attempts, we would essentially be beating this and there would be no comedy to it.
[39:47.94]But we're going to do this thing now where we're going to drop the facade.
[39:51.08]And I know you guys are doing Kappa and stuff like that, but you can tell that I'm not smiling when I'm saying this.
[39:59.66]That means that this is the one.
[40:02.21]This is going to be the one.
[40:03.98]Speaking of facade, Jerma, do you know that... The button shit just fucked me up.
[40:08.42]Jerma, I gotta ask you something.
[40:10.50]Oh, I already saw it.
[40:11.72]Yeah, somebody linked it.
[40:12.58]Yeah, somebody linked it last night.
[40:14.88]I did see it.
[40:15.88]I did.
[40:17.98]The image of the face on my face and it's the same face.
[40:21.93]Yeah, I saw it.
[40:24.11]Listen, do you have any, you know, anything to say about it?
[40:31.45]What am I supposed to say?
[40:32.71]I look like a character from the game?
[40:34.26]I mean, sorry, apologize.
[40:36.54]Why do I have to apologize for looking like somebody?
[40:39.56]Well, you know, it's... Apologize for looking like somebody.
[40:43.18]Jesus.
[40:45.22]That's unbelievable.
[40:46.70]Well, maybe to the audience, you know?
[40:48.84]Maybe they feel offended by the fact that you've been, like, you know, going around dinner parties and stuff.
[40:56.22]I don't know.
[41:00.66]Yeah, I just go around to dinner parties and I introduce myself.
[41:03.34]I don't know.
[41:04.34]Listen, it's fucking better than us trying to defuse bombs.
[41:06.90]Are you ready to do this?
[41:07.72]I'm sorry.
[41:09.12]And I'm going to give you the best instructions I can.
[41:11.50]All right, you better.
[41:12.10]There you go.
[41:12.86]There's the apology.
[41:13.50]Maybe I said the word out loud, Joel.
[41:18.30]Listen, we don't have time for your bullshit.
[41:19.79]No, I'm serious.
[41:20.35]Like, just say yes or no.

[48:11.33]We got...
[48:13.01]Uh, we got a, uh, I can't say this without saying the kana for key.
[48:17.71]Uh, fuck, do you know Japanese?
[48:20.59]I don't know any Japanese.
[48:22.13]Fuck, uh, okay, we got, like, a little, like, a railroad track.
[48:26.17]Like, it's a line with two, like, staples on it.
[48:34.50]What?
[48:35.02]Like a puzzle piece.
[48:36.90]Okay, like, okay, okay, yes, yes, yes, yes, okay, I see, I see, I got you.
[48:41.64]Okay, and then we got I. I, like the letter I. A. I know what you mean by that.
[48:51.03]And, like, I could use a little clearer instructions.
[48:53.47]Okay, what else?
[48:55.17]And that's it.
[48:55.99]Okay, so we got, you said there's a... There's an E with two dots.
[48:59.45]E with two dots.
[49:00.05]Yep, okay.
[49:01.23]And go over the... What's the other one?
[49:03.56]The railroad track, the IE.
[49:05.07]Alright, you ready?
[49:06.37]Okay.
[49:07.11]Backwards.
[49:07.77]Backwards E. Train track.
[49:09.93]IE.
[49:10.53]And then the H. The H thing.
[49:12.69]Alright, now we're going back to the fucker again.
[49:15.69]Alright, so... We really gotta remember this time.
[49:18.97]We cannot fuck up this time.
[49:20.10]Okay, we got a two.
[49:21.12]The fucker.
[49:29.46]Don't... Second position.
[49:33.47]Okay.
[49:37.87]One.
[49:40.45]Labeled four.
[49:41.33]Press the button labeled four.
[49:43.27]Got it.
[49:47.06]Two.
[49:49.02]Press the button with the same label you pressed in stage one.
[49:53.22]What was the first one?
[49:53.94]Same button or like, like, number?
[49:56.12]The same number.
[49:57.52]In stage one.
[49:59.24]Got it.
[50:01.34]Okay, now two.
[50:03.15]Press the button in the first position.
[50:06.85]Got it.
[50:09.84]Four.
[50:10.90]Press the button with the same label you pressed in stage three.
[50:15.58]Uh... I can't help you on this one.
[50:20.14]I think it was whatever was in the third position.
[50:22.50]I think.
[50:24.90]Yes, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it.
[50:26.40]Stun?
[50:27.41]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[50:28.09]Did we win?
[50:29.53]I think so.
[50:29.95]We beat level two.
[50:34.02]It's still going, though.
[50:34.94]It's still fucking going.
[50:35.98]So what?
[50:36.22]Is there anything else?
[50:37.16]Spin it or flip it around.
[50:38.80]Uh, shit.
[50:39.48]We got a serial port at the side.
[50:41.24]Oh, the wires!
[50:41.70]The wires!
[50:42.08]The wires!
[50:44.36]Blue, black, black, black, blue, white!
[50:48.46]Blue, black, blue, six wires?
[50:50.12]Yeah.
[50:52.96]Do we have an odd serial number?
[50:54.58]Oh!
[51:08.33]gamble at the very end and they took a random one and I swear to god if we would have won that way fuck it but here's the thing I thought if you fail a module that's it right so we were just sitting there and you're just spinning the thing around like all right we win we did it what I mean I don't know
[51:32.69]Okay.
[51:33.85]I'm doing this one more time.
[51:35.04]I'm going to get you through this one.
[51:36.30]I'm getting you through it.
[51:36.98]I'm going to do it.
[51:37.36]I'm going to get you through it.
[51:38.32]I'm going to get you through this one.
[51:41.62]To be fair, I did fuck up the wire one.
[51:43.64]I fucked up that first one.
[51:45.86]Here's the thing.
[51:47.16]I wanted to try you and see, like, ha ha ha ha.
[51:50.21]But I realized that's fucking utterly stupid of an idea that is to, like, fuck around with now.
[51:54.49]So I said, no, no, no, let's not do that.
[51:57.45]And I thought you didn't hear me.
[51:58.93]So I thought, like, okay, now we're going on a tangent where, like, you didn't hear my joke.
[52:03.35]So it just became this smear of, like, let's not fuck around with it.
[52:10.34]all right um all right for real this time listen okay this is it this is the one all right I'm gonna give you some tips to help me help you okay okay when when a module when you got the modules right immediately immediately tell me the number of like for wires number of wires immediately okay all right okay four wires got it then go right okay okay
[52:38.46]Because then I can go, bang, right there.
[52:41.47]Right there.
[52:42.27]And I'll be ready for it.
[52:42.95]But what if you fuck up?
[52:44.61]Well, I did fuck up last time.
[52:47.37]I fucked the whole thing up last time.
[52:49.98]I'm owning that.
[52:51.62]That was on me, man.
[52:53.48]Listen.
[52:54.24]This is the one.
[52:54.84]This is the one right now.
[52:56.12]Listen, I can only play so much Half-Life in my head.
[52:59.10]Eventually, there's too little space and I get a little dumb, you know?
[53:04.10]I'm just saying.
[53:04.92]It was my phone.
[53:06.68]It does say you're playing Half-Life every single day on Steam.
[53:10.40]Okay, that doesn't... Okay, just for clarification here, I've been playing Half-Life for like 35 days on Steam, and I don't know how to shut it down.
[53:18.14]It just says he's playing Half-Life.
[53:20.39]And I can't, like, Control-Alt-Delete in the panel or whatever is still there.
[53:25.07]I don't know what's going on.
[53:27.17]All right, listen.
[53:31.49]Task manager.
[53:32.47]Listen, listen.
[53:33.37]You think I'm a native English speaker?
[53:35.99]I barely understand half the shit I'm saying right now.
[53:38.73]Do you understand how incomprehensibly difficult it is to communicate with someone and like not grasp the words that are coming out of your mouth?
[53:50.59]No, no, no.
[53:51.47]Don't move the fucking mouse.
[53:52.53]I can't move the mouse.
[53:53.15]I can't click that link.
[53:53.99]I'm sorry.
[53:58.24]Jeremy, I swear I will go on the desktop and I will reveal all the stolen tax documents you got.
[54:03.02]Don't show my fucking taxes.
[54:05.46]Don't show my tax returns.
[54:06.84]Alright, let's go.
[54:07.58]We're doing this one.
[54:08.38]Level 2.
[54:08.91]I can't believe we can't do level 2.
[54:10.79]This is fucking embarrassing.
[54:11.95]Alright.
[54:12.95]Okay, here we go.
[54:13.91]We've got three wires.
[54:16.19]I didn't even know where we were going.
[54:18.29]Okay, three wires.
[54:19.99]Yes.
[54:20.71]Red, blue, white.
[54:21.87]Red, blue, and white.
[54:23.02]Okay.
[54:23.22]Yes.
[54:23.64]Yes.
[54:25.91]Is the last wire white?
[54:27.75]Yes.
[54:28.25]Cut the last wire.
[54:30.63]Gotcha.
[54:31.99]Next module, what is it?
[54:32.59]We got a whole new problem.
[54:33.79]We got a whole new model I'm familiar with.
[54:36.69]We have essentially Pac-Man.
[54:37.79]It looks like Pac-Man.
[54:38.59]Looks like Pac-Man.
[54:40.11]Looks like Pac-Man.
[54:40.71]Looks like Pac-Man.
[54:43.47]Okay.
[54:43.81]All right.
[54:44.07]All right.
[54:44.29]All right.
[54:44.55]It's like a maze.
[54:45.33]Okay.
[54:46.05]Yeah.
[54:47.29]Okay.
[54:47.57]This is a... Find the maze with the matching circular markings.
[54:52.40]The diffuser must... Hold on.
[54:54.34]The diffuser... Two circles?
[54:56.24]The diffuser must navigate the white light to the red triangle using the arrow buttons.
[55:00.67]Warning.
[55:01.63]Oh, fuck.
[55:02.27]I have your keyboard disabled.
[55:08.27]Jeremiah?
[55:09.41]Hold on.
[55:11.01]Hold on a second.
[55:11.43]Hold on.
[55:11.77]All right.
[55:12.39]I'll press the buttons.
[55:13.09]You just tell me what they are.
[55:14.21]Okay.
[55:16.01]Do not cross the lines.
[55:18.11]Do not cross the lines.
[55:19.98]Uh, in the maze.
[55:21.10]Okay, so, I have no fucking idea what this wants us to do.
[55:25.58]Is this battle, battle, battleship?
[55:27.63]Find the maze with the matching markings.
[55:29.85]Okay.
[55:31.27]Alright, so, where are the circles?
[55:34.71]Uh, there's two circles at, at, uh, the second row and the third row.
[55:38.45]Okay, second, alright.
[55:40.55]Are they on opposite ends?
[55:42.63]Uh, yes, sir.
[55:43.59]Okay, they're on opposite ends.
[55:44.90]So now...
[55:48.19]So that's the correct, this one here, but what, how am I, so you have to navigate, you must navigate the white light to the red triangle.
[55:56.70]Where's the red triangle?
[55:58.48]It's, uh, left of the, the right third column.
[56:05.91]Um, okay.
[56:06.73]So, so like one, two, three down and then one over from, from the right.
[56:12.30]Sure.
[56:14.29]So now you have to navigate the white light to the red triangle.
[56:17.91]Don't cross the lines.
[56:19.17]These lines are invisible on the bomb.
[56:21.79]We're fucked.
[56:22.69]We're fucked.
[56:23.99]You want to restart this?
[56:25.05]Wait, don't move.
[56:25.57]Don't move.
[56:32.60]It's over, Anakin.
[56:33.44]I have the high ground.
[56:34.98]I fucked it up.
[56:35.56]I fucked it up.
[56:36.76]You need to be able to press the keys.
[56:39.28]Just press a bunch of buttons and explode, and I'll give it to you.
[56:42.69]OK.
[56:45.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[56:47.00]You don't need the keys.
[56:48.18]You can use the mouse.
[56:49.20]You can use the mouse.
[56:50.16]What?
[56:51.20]You can use the mouse to navigate through the keys.
[56:52.94]You don't need the fucking nump, blah, blah, blah.
[56:54.84]Keep that, whatever.
[56:55.40]Well, it says you have to use the keys.
[56:58.90]OK.
[56:59.08]But the keys are on screen.
[57:00.86]It's not keys on the keyboard.
[57:02.78]It says the arrow buttons.
[57:04.06]The arrow keys.
[57:04.94]Yeah, but they are on screen as touchpad shit.
[57:07.54]OK.
[57:08.46]You have to... That one's the right one.
[57:11.54]Hey, don't give me that tone.
[57:12.88]Find the maze?
[57:15.02]You must navigate the white light to the red triangle using the arrow buttons.
[57:18.17]You have to navigate the white light to the red triangle.
[57:21.63]Don't cross the lines shown in the maze.
[57:24.85]These are invisible to the bomb.
[57:26.85]Okay, are you ready?
[57:28.43]Yep.
[57:28.81]You want to go up?
[57:30.69]Up?
[57:31.87]Up's not an option.
[57:32.75]What do you mean?
[57:33.25]No, what do you mean not an option?
[57:34.37]Aren't you starting right here?
[57:35.61]You spat out red at me.
[57:38.03]You can't go up?
[57:39.49]No, I can't go up.
[57:41.73]You have to be able to go up.
[57:43.23]No!
[57:43.47]Hang on, hang on, hang on, okay.
[57:49.50]I don't even know what I'm looking at here.
[57:54.40]It's the light?
[57:55.66]The light.
[57:57.38]You must navigate the white light to the red triangle.
[57:59.66]Tell him where the white dot is or get to the bottom at, at, uh...
[58:03.89]Bottom at the... Dude, this is fucked.
[58:08.07]It's like the sixth spot.
[58:11.19]The sixth spot?
[58:12.50]No, fifth spot.
[58:13.36]Sorry.
[58:13.56]I'm stressed out.
[58:14.50]Okay.
[58:14.76]So, all right.
[58:15.16]We're down all the way at the bottom.
[58:16.10]You're in the last spot.
[58:17.80]Okay.
[58:18.38]Go.
[58:18.70]You can't go up?
[58:20.28]No, I can't go up.
[58:22.00]Are we... Do we... Are we correct?
[58:24.74]You're all the way at the bottom in the sixth spot?
[58:26.26]Like the second last one.
[58:27.60]Oh, the second to le- Okay.
[58:29.54]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[58:30.62]So you're second to last... You're second to last spot?
[58:34.52]Are you- Okay.
[58:35.66]Go left.
[58:38.04]Can't go left.
[58:43.42]Where the fuck are you?
[58:47.80]I'm gonna go right.
[58:49.84]That worked.
[58:50.91]Hey, we're dead, by the way.
[58:51.79]I'm cheating.
[58:52.43]I don't even know where he is.
[58:53.61]All right, I get this now.
[58:54.69]I understand this.
[58:56.11]You understand this?
[58:57.03]Mm-hmm.
[59:03.83]Okay, chat, chat, chat.
[59:05.43]Was that Jerma's fault or my fault?
[59:10.95]Whose fault was that one?
[59:13.36]Both.
[59:13.72]It was my fault?
[59:15.34]Both?
[59:16.98]When we get new modules, you gotta figure out what to do.
[59:20.68]I don't even know what it wanted us to do.
[59:21.92]Alright.
[59:26.26]Alright, do it again.
[59:26.78]Rapid fire.
[59:27.14]Do it again.
[59:27.40]Do it again.
[59:27.74]Rapid fire.
[59:28.16]Go.
[59:28.28]Do it again.
[59:28.66]Start it again.
[59:29.28]Start it again.
[59:29.80]Let's go.

[59:31.64]It's gotta be fucking Simon Says or it's gonna be the fucker.
[59:33.98]Alright.

[59:38.74]Okay.
[59:39.78]Okay.
[59:40.06]Okay.
[59:40.26]We got Simon Says.

[59:54.94]He didn't check the serial... Alright.
[59:57.71]Okay.
[59:57.89]Okay, serial number is... Is that the serial number?
[60:00.03]Fuck, hang on.
[60:00.57]Does it have a vowel?
[60:04.73]It definitely doesn't have a vowel.
[60:05.55]Okay, let's go.
[60:06.65]What was it?
[60:07.31]You said it was blue?

[60:17.78]It's all fucking yellow!
[60:19.12]Wait, you said it flashed blue.
[60:21.16]Oh, we had a strike.
[60:23.26]Oopsie.
[60:24.68]Now we have two strikes.
[60:26.04]Oh, boy.
[60:26.92]Press green.

[60:59.86]Keypad, keypad.
[61:02.45]Backward C with two dots.
[61:03.37]Yep.
[61:05.70]We got an omega symbol.
[61:07.12]I don't know what that is.
[61:08.22]I don't know what that is.
[61:09.38]I'm not kidding.
[61:10.10]I don't fucking know what that is.
[61:11.12]No, omega symbol, for real.
[61:12.32]I don't know what that is.
[61:13.72]I have no idea what that is.
[61:14.66]No, you know what a fucking omega symbol is.
[61:16.12]Just do the other symbols.
[61:16.82]I have no idea.
[61:17.20]No, no, no.
[61:18.36]It's like an O with... Think Ultramarine's Warhammer.
[61:21.90]I didn't play that game.
[61:23.09]No, you did.
[61:23.47]What's the next symbol?
[61:24.25]What's the third symbol?
[61:25.29]It's like... It's the U with the I in it.
[61:34.32]THE GOD OF WAR SYMBOL, YOU MOTHERFUCKER GOD!
[61:36.48]I don't know what the god- I didn't- I played, like, the first four hours!
[61:39.44]I played the first four hours of God of War.
[61:41.50]I played the first- that wasn't in the God of War game.
[61:43.06]FUCKING QUAKE SYMBOL!
[61:44.30]UPSIDE DOWN QUAKE SYMBOL, JESUS!
[61:45.58]I don't even know what- I don't know what all the video game symbols are.

[62:24.53]It's a button?
[62:25.83]Yeah.
[62:26.15]It's a red button?
[62:26.75]Okay.
[62:27.45]Yeah.
[62:28.64]It says hold on it?
[62:30.06]Yeah.
[62:31.17]How many batteries are in the bomb?
[62:34.06]There is three.
[62:35.12]Zero.
[62:35.30]Okay.
[62:35.42]No, there's four.
[62:37.08]There's four.
[62:37.42]There's four.
[62:37.80]Sorry.
[62:37.96]Okay.
[62:38.18]Okay.
[62:38.28]Okay.
[62:39.56]Is there a lit indicator with the label FRK?
[62:43.72]Um, it's not lit.
[62:45.95]It's not lit.
[62:47.83]Press and hold.
[62:48.49]Press and hold the button.
[62:49.13]Hold on.
[62:49.67]And then release the button.
[62:56.42]Grandma.
[63:02.89]If the button is red in the bar, it didn't say off.
[63:09.23]I'm going to eat this fucking paper.
[63:12.73]What was this?
[63:13.17]Was there a strip?
[63:18.41]I checked all the fuck.
[63:19.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[63:21.83]There was a switch on the bottom.
[63:23.81]What do you mean there's a switch?
[63:25.95]There was a switch on the bottom.
[63:28.85]I don't get it.
[63:29.37]That was my fault.
[63:32.84]That was my fault?
[63:33.74]Was there a switch on the bottom?
[63:35.28]Was it my fault?
[63:38.10]Whose fault was that?
[63:39.10]Who can take the blame for that one?
[63:42.44]Who takes the blame?
[63:43.08]Who takes the blame?
[63:43.74]Alright.
[63:47.43]That was Jerma's fault?
[63:49.07]Do it again.
[63:49.57]Do it again.
[63:49.95]Do it again.
[63:50.27]We can do this.
[63:51.11]This is not level 2.
[63:51.73]This is level 3.
[63:52.23]We have to beat level 3.
[63:53.81]Do it again.
[63:54.83]Oh god.
[63:55.69]Do it again.
[63:55.95]Do it again.
[63:56.87]Do it again.
[63:57.31]Okay.

[64:02.03]First module is Simon Says.
[64:07.01]Okay, hang on.
[64:07.71]Okay, I'm looking at it.
[64:08.49]Is there a serial number?
[64:09.57]Is there a vowel in the serial number?
[64:10.69]Serial number says, you want the serial number?
[64:13.31]Is there a vowel in the serial number?
[64:16.67]Is W a vowel?
[64:18.27]No.
[64:19.11]No.
[64:19.83]Is there A-E-I-O-U?
[64:24.65]Okay, what happened?
[64:26.91]No, it's not fucking violence.
[64:27.84]I'm just kidding.
[64:28.30]Come on.
[64:28.96]It's green.
[64:30.02]Green on Simon Says.
[64:31.12]Come on.
[64:32.10]Okay, then press green.
[64:36.28]Green on green?
[64:37.28]Green on green.
[64:39.22]Green is pressed.
[64:42.36]Green, green.
[64:43.18]Green, green.
[64:46.97]Green, green.

[64:51.95]Green, green, yellow.
[64:56.02]Okay, we got it.
[64:56.80]Okay, keypad, keypad time.
[64:57.85]We got, we got a smiley face.
[64:59.79]Okay, yep.
[65:03.03]Uh, spider.
[65:04.55]Okay.
[65:06.07]Uh, backwards B, P. Okay.
[65:09.89]TB.
[65:10.85]Okay, you ready?
[65:11.61]Backwards P, TB, spider, smiley.
[65:14.33]Okay, say that slower, slower.
[65:15.83]Backwards P, TB, spider, smiley.
[65:22.22]Got it.
[65:23.73]Okay, now we got a big red button that says detonate on it.
[65:25.77]Is it red?
[65:29.43]Okay, hold on.
[65:31.01]How many batteries are in that bomb?
[65:32.97]Okay, I'm checking, I'm checking.
[65:34.13]We have, there is two batteries, two batteries.
[65:38.91]And it says detonate?
[65:40.65]Yes.
[65:41.19]Press and immediately release the button.
[65:44.83]We did it!
[65:45.47]We did it!
[65:51.12]You see, Germa?
[65:53.68]If you listen to me... That was quick.
[65:57.06]If you listen to me, everything will be fine.
[65:59.76]It only took us an hour and 10 minutes to beat level 3.
[66:02.46]If you start screaming at me... You screamed at me first.
[66:05.94]You screamed at me first.
[66:06.66]You yelled at me first.
[66:08.38]Chet, did I yell at Jerma?
[66:09.48]You've been yelling at me the whole time.
[66:10.94]I haven't yelled at you once.
[66:11.76]No, I have not yelled once.
[66:13.30]I have not yelled at you one time.
[66:15.86]Look at Chet.
[66:16.28]Look at what Chet's saying.
[66:17.44]I haven't yelled at you once.
[66:18.42]I have not yelled once.
[66:19.20]They're saying, no, Joel, you did not scream at Jerma.
[66:21.44]No, I didn't yell once.
[66:23.05]Jeremiah, you don't know what an omega symbol is.
[66:24.53]You're invalid to say anything.
[66:27.37]Anything you say is null and void.
[66:29.65]How can you not look what... Listen, I might be a dumb motherfucker, listen.
[66:32.89]I might be drinking, like, toilet water, but at least I know what a fucking omega symbol is.
[66:36.56]You're American.
[66:37.78]Like, don't you read books?
[66:39.04]Yeah, it's Greek.
[66:40.12]It's Greek, and I'm American.
[66:42.42]Well, you know.
[66:43.08]I don't know a Greek language.
[66:45.86]So what?
[66:46.28]Well, you fucking live in Boston.
[66:47.52]You gotta speak a whole other language.
[66:48.68]I can't fucking understand what you're saying.
[66:49.94]I don't know a Greek letter.
[66:52.68]I live in fucking America.
[66:54.02]I live in Boston.
[66:54.82]I don't even live in Boston.
[66:56.04]Listen, you eat like, don't your pizzas, aren't they baked wrong?
[67:00.56]Pizzas?
[67:01.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[67:02.80]Isn't like Boston pizza like something wrong with it?
[67:07.28]No, wait, no, sorry.
[67:08.12]I'm being an insensitive asshole.
[67:10.26]I'm thinking of Chicago deep style.
[67:11.72]Sorry.
[67:13.12]No, Boston pizza is ranked number seven in the world, by the way, in the world for pizza.
[67:17.23]Wait, wait, you guys have your own pizza?
[67:19.26]Boston pizza is ranked at number seven in the world.
[67:22.09]What the fuck is Boston pizza?
[67:23.81]Most delicious pizza.
[67:25.99]It's like thin, crispy, you get fucking pepperoni on it.
[67:29.21]I don't know.
[67:31.21]So that's how your brain looks, huh?
[67:34.51]I can't talk about pizza.
[67:36.01]I'll have to stop the stream and leave.
[67:38.77]All right.
[67:39.15]I can't talk about that.
[67:39.91]It's crispy and thin as you get pepperoni.
[67:41.25]I can't talk.
[67:41.69]All right, move on.
[67:42.29]Let's press the next button.
[67:43.77]I will leave and get a pepperoni pizza right now.
[67:45.79]I swear to God, this happens every fucking stream.
[67:48.04]Alright, what do we got?
[67:48.54]Okay, uh, we finished two levels.
[67:52.44]Can we finish this third one?
[67:53.82]Jesus.
[67:55.82]How the fuck did we not do this?
[67:59.92]What do you mean you gotta stop the stream because you're talking about pizza?
[68:02.58]Stop saying that word.
[68:04.57]Why?
[68:06.77]Stop saying that word.
[68:08.01]Because if I hear it enough times, I'll start thinking about a fucking thin crispy crust.
[68:12.67]How about tomato crusty slice?
[68:16.06]Nah, that's not doing it for me.
[68:18.06]Nah.
[68:19.04]You hungry?
[68:19.54]Yeah, you fixed it.
[68:20.56]Stop.
[68:21.99]Alright, what's the first module?
[68:24.51]What's the first module?
[68:26.15]Is this a weakness?
[68:29.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:30.45]Listen, we'll get through this.
[68:31.45]I'm just wondering, like, like a tomato blood flesh slice makes you horny?
[68:35.79]What did you just say?
[68:38.00]What are you talking about?
[68:39.41]Ugh.
[68:39.57]I'm just asking, like, like, like... I'm not gonna have sex with pizza.
[68:42.39]No, no, no, no.
[68:42.95]I'll tell you what.
[68:44.17]I, I, I have a big pee-pee problem, right?
[68:46.47]If people say waterfall for me, I get really, like, in the mood for peeing.
[68:51.22]So if I say, like, the word jidza, you get really horny for pizza.
[68:58.24]You're on thin ice, young man.
[68:59.82]We're gonna, we're gonna do this.
[69:04.49]We're gonna do this next one, all right?
[69:06.57]I'm ready.
[69:08.06]double your money the task is clear but the timer doesn't work but doesn't care about your workload wait the timer doesn't work in this one no no it's being descriptive but I don't think it's quite literally the task is clear but the timer doesn't care about your workload
[69:23.26]So there's no timer?
[69:25.28]Okay.
[69:25.72]Let's try it.
[69:26.40]Jerma, here's what we're going to do.
[69:27.30]Let me see what it says.
[69:27.94]Double your money.
[69:30.12]The task is clear, but the timer doesn't care about your work.
[69:32.78]That's a lot of modules.
[69:34.61]That's a shitload of modules.
[69:36.09]That's six modules.
[69:36.97]This is the first real test.
[69:38.05]Jerma, what are you doing?
[69:40.27]Let go of the mouse, man.
[69:42.27]Let go of the mouse.
[69:42.93]What are you doing?
[69:43.41]I'm not touching anything.
[69:45.45]What?
[69:46.47]Jerma.
[69:47.19]I'm not touching anything.
[69:48.49]Jerma.
[69:49.33]What?
[69:52.26]I'm not touching anything.
[69:53.69]Don't worry about it.
[69:55.17]Six fucking modules.
[69:56.15]Six fucking modules?
[69:58.43]The mouse is right there.
[69:59.23]All right.
[69:59.57]Six modules.
[70:00.13]Let's get it done.
[70:00.57]Let's get it done.
[70:05.23]Listen.
[70:05.67]What do you got?
[70:05.99]This is going to be the last try.
[70:07.71]We'll continue this at some point.
[70:08.91]This is going to be my last one.
[70:11.17]All right.
[70:13.32]You ready to make this count?
[70:14.16]His brain is on fire.
[70:17.02]All right.
[70:17.24]Are you ready?
[70:18.62]Yes.
[70:19.64]First one is a wire module.
[70:21.40]How many wires?
[70:23.36]We got four.
[70:24.07]We got blue, red, two white.
[70:25.93]Two white.
[70:26.41]Okay.
[70:27.05]Blue, red, two white.
[70:28.89]Yep.
[70:29.17]Okay.
[70:29.53]They said there's one blue wire?
[70:35.07]There's one blue wire.
[70:35.85]First one.
[70:36.35]Cut the first wire.
[70:38.63]Gotcha.
[70:39.31]Okay.
[70:40.07]Number two.
[70:40.38]What's it?
[70:41.52]It's a bunch of keypad modules, whatever.
[70:44.34]Okay.
[70:44.78]Yep.
[70:45.80]Okay.
[70:46.00]We got a three that's kind of like squiggling off in the distance.
[70:48.22]It's not quite a three.
[70:49.08]It's like half a three.
[70:49.72]And then it goes like on a ski path.
[70:51.76]Got it.
[70:52.02]I got you.
[70:53.11]We got an at symbol, but it's kind of like wrong.
[70:58.50]Okay.
[70:59.78]Do you understand?
[71:03.12]I think so.
[71:04.22]I think so.
[71:05.80]Okay.
[71:07.64]Like, think infogrames.
[71:09.48]Okay.
[71:09.70]Okay.
[71:10.86]Okay.
[71:11.35]Okay.
[71:11.49]Hollow star, not black one.
[71:12.59]Got it.
[71:14.09]And then copyright.
[71:14.75]Okay.
[71:15.73]Copyright, weird at symbol, weird three, and then star.
[71:19.49]Okay.
[71:21.29]Gotcha.
[71:21.55]All right.
[71:21.87]We got another, we got another, uh, module.
[71:23.61]What is it?
[71:24.69]We got an upside down question mark here.
[71:26.72]Oh, it's another one.
[71:27.20]Okay.
[71:27.42]Yeah.
[71:27.70]Yep.
[71:27.82]Yep.
[71:27.92]Yep.
[71:28.04]Yep.
[71:28.12]Yep.
[71:29.28]Yep.
[71:30.12]Then we got infogrames again.
[71:31.00]Okay.
[71:31.64]We've got a drooling O. Yep.
[71:34.96]And the H with the little, uh, thing at the bottom.
[71:37.58]You got it.
[71:37.96]Okay.
[71:38.22]Drooling O, uh, messed up at symbol, the weird H and then upside.
[71:44.25]Yeah.
[71:45.00]Yeah, we got it.
[71:45.52]Okay, now we got six wires.
[71:48.20]Okay, hold on.
[71:49.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[71:50.00]Six wires.
[71:50.92]Okay, six wires.
[71:52.60]Okay.
[71:53.46]Two red, one yellow, two blue, one white.
[71:57.18]You said one yellow?
[71:58.66]Yeah.
[72:00.86]And there is only one white wire, right?
[72:03.12]Yes.
[72:04.30]Okay.
[72:05.50]Are there any red wires?
[72:07.72]There's two red wires at the start.
[72:09.04]Okay.
[72:12.33]Cut the fourth wire.
[72:14.81]You sure?
[72:16.29]You sure?
[72:17.95]Yes.
[72:19.41]We got it.
[72:20.45]What's next?
[72:20.91]Come on, keep going.
[72:23.63]There's nothing.
[72:25.44]Spin the box around.
[72:26.22]You gotta spin the box around, I think.
[72:27.48]There could be stuff on the other side.
[72:29.24]There's stuff on the other side.
[72:30.66]Fuck, hang on.
[72:31.16]Oh god, the game is lagging.
[72:33.62]It's so laggy right now.
[72:34.94]Okay, we got two detonate buttons.
[72:36.83]Two detonate buttons.
[72:38.17]Okay, what color is the first one?
[72:41.29]They're both white.
[72:42.07]They're both white.
[72:42.81]Okay.
[72:43.11]What is on the text of the first button?
[72:45.85]Detonate.
[72:46.61]Okay.
[72:46.85]It says, hold on.
[72:50.15]Okay.
[72:50.85]How many batteries are on it?
[72:52.19]Is there more than one battery on the bomb?
[72:55.92]There is three batteries in total on this whole thing.
[72:58.94]Okay.
[72:59.54]And that button says detonate?
[73:01.58]Yes.
[73:02.02]Press and immediately release it.
[73:04.00]You sure?
[73:04.64]Yes.
[73:06.72]Yes.
[73:07.14]What is the text of the other one?
[73:08.52]Detonate.
[73:10.14]Okay.
[73:11.80]Do it again.
[73:12.34]Press and release it again.
[73:14.19]Detonate!
[73:20.87]Unbelievable.
[73:21.83]Unbelievable.
[73:25.66]It's almost like if I'm just pretending here, and I said it would be the last one, just to make sure that we do this online.
[73:31.06]Anyway.
[73:34.25]Unbelievable, guys.
[73:35.13]You see, that's what happens when you think, Jerma.
[73:39.03]So are you done?
[73:41.32]No, no, no.
[73:42.04]I can go all night.
[73:42.62]I can go all night.
[73:44.46]Because, I mean, I took a multivitamin, like, four hours ago.
[73:48.10]Just specifically to make sure I do it.
[73:49.44]You took Viagra?
[73:50.74]No, multivitamin.
[73:51.48]I took, like, B-complex, like, vitamin C. Why are you taking, like, drugs on stream, man?
[73:58.84]I took a multivitamin because I wanted to make sure I could focus.
[74:03.04]Well, now you're horny.
[74:06.69]Alright, do you want to do the reading for a little bit?
[74:12.17]Listen, here's what I propose.
[74:14.91]In order for us to maintain this amount of quality, I propose that we do one more, and then I'm going to do some other stupid shit tonight.
[74:23.10]But next Saturday, if you guys want to chat, would you want us to resume this game, and next stream we do, I do the reading,
[74:38.16]It's harder than it looks.
[74:39.84]What are they saying on your chat?
[74:41.49]Are they all saying no?
[74:42.21]They're saying yes.
[74:44.77]Okay, well, they're saying yes at mine, too.
[74:48.69]We did that one pretty good, too.
[74:50.79]You know, I gotta say, though, once you stop taking Super Mario Boner pills, you're pretty good at this.
[74:59.24]But you keep doing this to me.
[75:02.06]You keep doing this to me where you can't read Omega symbols, and it's...
[75:06.23]You're being real silly.
[75:08.53]Just don't play Halo is what they said.
[75:11.63]Alright, that works.
[75:15.37]Alright, well, you ready for the next one?
[75:16.99]Alright, let's do the next one.
[75:19.27]Let's go.
[75:21.82]Listen, as long as it's not Simon Says.
[75:23.82]Simon Says is hard because when you say... I could explain it.
[75:27.22]It's fucking hard.
[75:28.24]Alright, you ready?
[75:28.68]Alright, here we go.
[75:30.68]Next one is called One Step Up.
[75:32.04]It's for those who have made it this far and want something tougher but not too tough.
[75:36.44]Which for us means fucking impossible.
[75:39.12]I can't believe we spent that much time on the second fucking level.
[75:40.90]This level is the equivalent of like licking your elbow.
[75:44.71]Are you face camming right now?
[75:46.33]Yeah.

[76:06.14]He did it?
[76:06.54]Okay.
[76:08.12]Well, if he can do that, then, then, uh, then I'm sure we can do this.
[76:11.74]Yeah.
[76:12.82]I did it.
[76:13.79]I did it both ways just to prove I could do it.
[76:17.77]You ready?

[77:04.40]Three.
[77:04.82]That was the number three.

[77:54.46]I didn't say that.
[77:55.72]I did.
[77:56.22]Three.
[77:59.46]Same label you pressed in stage four, which was a four.
[78:04.06]Is that your final answer, Jeremiah?
[78:05.04]I don't know, yeah.
[78:08.74]You're pretty smart.
[78:09.54]All right, is it, right?
[78:11.08]Yeah, okay.
[78:11.92]All right, now we got the battleship Pac-Man thing going on.
[78:15.85]Okay, so what do you need to know?
[78:18.25]All right, where are the circles?
[78:21.03]The circle says at the second position, top and bottom.
[78:26.64]What?
[78:27.20]Okay, give me, like, six across row what?
[78:31.56]Like, two across row what?
[78:32.84]You know what I mean?
[78:33.38]Okay, so in total, you got six dots on each, right?
[78:35.96]Yeah.
[78:36.18]Six and six, right?
[78:37.14]Yes, yes, yes.
[78:37.46]So the top one, the circle is at the top, at the second one.
[78:41.63]Okay, I think I got it.
[78:44.01]And is the one directly below that on the last line?
[78:47.75]Like, is it matching directly below it?
[78:49.77]Yeah, at the bottom, yes.
[78:52.15]Okay, so you have to take the white light...
[78:55.65]Yes.
[78:56.43]And you have to get to the red triangle.
[78:59.19]Right.
[78:59.81]Okay, do not cross these lines.
[79:01.77]Okay, where is the red triangle?
[79:04.99]The red triangle is at the second row at the first position.
[79:08.31]Second row first.
[79:08.99]Okay, are you ready?
[79:09.83]That top position, the top one, go left and then down.
[79:12.83]That's it.
[79:15.65]That did not work.
[79:16.79]What do you mean?
[79:18.48]Okay, people are saying, where is the light?
[79:20.72]Do you need a light?
[79:21.72]Yeah.
[79:23.38]You need a light?
[79:24.44]Yeah, you must navigate the white light to the red triangle.
[79:28.32]Fifth top.
[79:29.12]Are we talking about the same thing?
[79:30.66]Yeah, okay.
[79:31.52]Listen, listen, listen, listen.
[79:32.95]Down.
[79:34.83]Down.
[79:36.01]Left.
[79:37.77]Up.
[79:37.89]Left.
[79:39.53]Up.
[79:39.63]Left.
[79:40.97]Left.
[79:41.47]Left.
[79:43.06]Oh, I fucked you up.
[79:43.74]I fucked you up.
[79:44.26]Hey, go ahead.
[79:44.64]Just run into the wall.
[79:46.25]I fucked you up.
[79:47.49]No, no, no.
[79:47.83]We can still do this.
[79:48.79]No, no, we can't.
[79:49.31]We can't.
[79:49.59]Trust me.
[79:49.87]We can't.
[79:50.11]We can't get into the wall.
[79:51.01]What's the point of the two circles?
[79:52.09]I don't understand.
[79:53.11]All right.
[79:53.37]No, no.
[79:53.55]Just run into a wall.
[79:54.12]Run into a wall.
[79:54.52]Seriously.
[79:56.34]Where is the red triangle again?
[79:57.44]I solved it!
[79:58.00]I solved it anyway!
[80:00.79]Fuck it, whatever!
[80:01.65]Fuck it, whatever!
[80:02.41]Let's use the keypad, keypad!
[80:03.63]We got, we got a butt!
[80:04.57]We got a giant ass!
[80:07.87]Giant ass?
[80:08.49]I don't see an ass.
[80:09.71]Giant, giant badonkadonk!
[80:11.53]Okay, okay, okay, I got it!
[80:12.67]I see the giant ass!
[80:13.85]Alright.

[80:27.52]So, uh, big ass, three squiggly half-life star.
[80:33.62]Okay, okay.

[80:37.04]Blue.
[80:39.00]Okay, it's a blue button and it says abort on it.
[80:41.17]Okay.
[80:41.71]Yes.
[80:42.35]Hold the button down.
[80:44.57]Okay.
[80:44.89]What happened?
[80:46.53]It's showing a blue one.
[80:47.57]Okay.
[80:47.89]Blue line.
[80:48.53]Release when the countdown timer has a four in any position.
[80:52.21]Okay.
[80:54.64]We got it.
[80:55.40]We got it.
[80:55.84]We're getting better at this.
[80:56.90]We got it.
[80:57.34]We got it.
[80:57.86]We're getting better at this shit.
[81:01.70]We got this, man.
[81:02.50]Yeah, we're getting much better at this shit.
[81:06.34]Dude, we're gamers.
[81:12.35]Let's do a high five.
[81:13.75]Okay, you ready?
[81:14.97]Yeah.
[81:18.53]Yeah, it's because we're from across the world, so the latency, the sound latency was bad.
[81:23.49]Yeah, dude, the lag is really messing up our cerebral power together, you know?
[81:30.07]All right.
[81:30.37]So are you, are you, you all, you're done for today with this?
[81:33.92]Okay.
[81:34.18]Tell me what, let's do one more.
[81:37.02]Cause we're on a roll here.
[81:38.62]We really tapped into our potential here, you know?
[81:41.16]All right.
[81:43.44]Then I, what am I going to, I'm going to move on to something else.
[81:45.38]What am I going to, what am I going to play?
[81:48.08]I'm going to go.
[81:48.84]How about this?
[81:49.40]How about, how about, how about this?
[81:50.84]You look up basic Greek for idiots.
[81:54.78]All right.
[81:58.26]You ready to do this last one?
[81:59.84]All right.
[82:00.16]What do you got here?
[82:03.83]No, I'm not going to play Jump King.
[82:04.83]No way.
[82:07.23]What Jump King?
[82:09.25]Oh, wait.
[82:09.55]You were supposed to play that and beat it, weren't you?
[82:12.89]What?
[82:13.45]You were supposed to play that and beat it.
[82:15.37]You didn't beat it, though.
[82:16.67]I beat your ass.
[82:17.43]OK.
[82:19.35]You ready?
[82:20.65]Pick your nose, whatever this says.
[82:21.81]All right.
[82:24.65]OK.
[82:24.91]Reading this only uses up time, so you don't have chop chop.
[82:27.11]All right.
[82:27.69]You ready?
[82:34.15]Yeah, guys, do you think Jerma scared him?
[82:45.97]Alright, anyway, uh, oh fuck, we don't have any time, okay, oh, okay, we have a whole new module right now, we have a whole new module right now.
[82:52.59]What's it look like?
[82:53.19]It's saying six things, saying no, middle, uh, nothing, blank, ready.
[82:57.52]First, first word is no.
[82:59.50]Okay, using the label from step one, push the first button that appears in its course, okay, you said the first word was no?
[83:05.12]Yes.
[83:05.62]Okay, um, what?
[83:08.14]Hit blank?
[83:10.63]I don't understand.
[83:11.07]No, that didn't work here.
[83:12.85]Using the label from step one, push the first button that appears in its corresponding list.
[83:20.11]German, what are you doing?
[83:21.01]I don't know.
[83:21.95]Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, okay.
[83:24.38]So wait, there's like, okay.
[83:27.54]Read the display.
[83:28.20]Speak English.
[83:28.78]I'm trying to.
[83:29.30]Speak English.
[83:29.60]It's the new module.
[83:30.68]Speak English and I can't understand you.
[83:32.32]I'm trying to.
[83:32.90]Bring him out.
[83:34.54]Bring him out.
[83:37.25]Alright, so, read the display and use step one to determine what button's label to read.
[83:43.31]Using this button label, fuck me.
[83:45.68]Okay, based on the display, read the label of the- So what was the word, no?
[83:49.18]Alright, you said no, right?
[83:50.46]Okay, can you click, like, in the bottom right corner?
[83:54.08]You said it was no, right?
[83:56.28]No, no, no, you said bottom right!
[83:57.82]No, no, no, but the word was no, right?
[84:00.31]Ugh.
[84:09.71]Jeremiah, you're about to witness how gamers do it.
[84:13.63]Watch this.
[84:14.13]I don't know what he wants us to do.
[84:17.90]I'm trying to figure out what he wants us to do.
[84:21.56]Did you just throw the bomb on the ground and step on it?
[84:24.60]Listen, I just took a chance.
[84:26.00]I took a chance and I pressed something random.
[84:27.48]Sometimes that shit works, you know?
[84:28.70]Text, text, text, text.
[84:32.89]Read the display.
[84:33.67]I'm going to have to look at that.
[84:34.75]I'm going to have to look at that.
[84:39.83]okay um tell you what this first time we've seen in this module is a new module all right what do you want what's up what's up yeah what's what you said tell you this guy you said you said tell you talking you're gonna fight you wanna kiss kiss my gut
[85:06.26]Why is it so impossible to do anything with you?
[85:08.33]Why do you have to be so difficult always?
[85:10.59]We're all here rooting for you.
[85:14.33]We're all here rooting for you.
[85:15.43]We all believe in you, Jeremiah.
[85:16.95]Why do you have to do this every time?
[85:18.93]I want you to look at my stream.
[85:19.95]I open up my stream and look.
[85:22.30]Look at this.
[85:22.70]This is what I had to work with.
[85:30.40]I don't know what that shit is.
[85:33.34]You want me to go over to your stream?
[85:36.22]well you can look over can't you I don't know do I want to like put myself down there it's I don't even I what what was on your screen okay hang on joel you are so argumentative I'm not argumentative I I'm being fair I don't think he's being very fair I don't think he's being very fair
[86:02.11]Okay, okay, you want me to look at what you've printed out or whatever?
[86:06.33]No, just look, see?
[86:08.65]You said the word was no.
[86:11.17]There's no, so then there's this eyeball in the bottom right.
[86:14.27]I figured you had to press that.
[86:16.56]Okay, hang on, hang on.
[86:18.12]We got this, we got this.
[86:20.28]Stop fucking screaming at me.
[86:21.90]Oh, wait a minute.
[86:26.12]I don't understand.
[86:30.14]The list, but...
[86:33.36]No, but what the fuck does this even mean?
[86:39.10]Chairman, you've got really tiny hands.
[86:41.62]My hands are fucking actually huge.
[86:43.34]Like, I'm sorry to tell you.
[86:44.36]You have the tiniest hands I've ever seen.
[86:45.98]I've got, like, monster hands.
[86:48.07]You're looking right now.
[86:49.87]These things are fucking monstrous.
[86:52.71]Look at this shit.
[86:54.73]Yeah, but maybe they're just kind of, like, normal-sized, and, you know, the rest of you kind of, you know...
[87:01.28]That was Joel that was playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes with Joel.
[87:06.42]And apparently he's got to go.
[87:08.82]He's got something else going on today.
[87:10.70]He's got something else to do.
[87:12.92]It was good playing with you, though.
[87:20.31]It was something.
[87:24.15]And I look forward to the next time we are trying to defuse bombs.
[87:27.39]Listen, we're going to beat this game together.
[87:30.92]No matter how tough this is going to get, to the power of the mind and with patience.
[87:39.08]I thought we could get it done.
[87:41.82]We are getting it done.
[87:42.62]I'm just saying, next time, you're going to realize, when I read these instructions, that's when you understand.
[87:50.47]I feel like if I had the bomb in my hand and we flipped it around...
[87:54.10]It will be... I could probably get it... You could probably feed me info better.
[87:59.10]And I could do the actual clicking and moving around better.
[88:02.14]We did it wrong.
[88:02.76]We should have been the other way.
[88:04.65]All right.
[88:04.99]All right.
[88:05.25]Well, we'll check back next week.
[88:10.05]Saturday.
[88:13.53]And then, yeah, whatever you do for the rest of your stream, have a good stream.
[88:16.25]All right.
[88:17.47]Well, I'll tell you what...
[88:22.21]I was talking to Jerma about this before we started streaming.
[88:25.18]I was talking about the Keyfabe.
[88:27.60]You guys know what Keyfabe is in chat?
[88:29.20]What the fuck were you even talking about?
[88:31.10]Keyfabe?
[88:34.10]uh do you know what that is no it's like it's like the terms of wrestlers use listen uh it's a term wrestlers used to like not break character and I'm gonna break character so like mute the stream or uh unmute it because uh it's been so terrible beside the point listen I'm saying that german eye
[88:57.31]uh if you think if you think that we're we're we hate each other don't worry about it we do does it beside the point uh it was really fun coming on the stream uh on this one listen um
[89:14.07]It was fun.
[89:14.99]It was fun.
[89:15.37]It was a lot of fun.
[89:16.63]I look forward to more streams and hopefully this stream was just a little bit better than Halo Reach.
[89:22.96]Just a little like... No, this was a thousand times better than Halo Reach.
[89:27.00]Without a doubt, in my mind.
[89:29.38]But still the worst of 2020 though.
[89:31.48]No, it was not.
[89:32.29]No, it wasn't.
[89:35.01]No, what?
[89:35.83]I only streamed like three times in 2020.
[89:38.57]No, twice.
[89:39.15]This is the second time.
[89:40.59]Oh, shit.
[89:42.75]Well, I'll tell you what.
[89:43.79]I'll tell you what.
[89:44.73]Incompatible friends.
[89:48.23]What?
[89:48.87]Incompatible friends?
[89:49.99]That's what somebody just said.
[89:52.75]All right.
[89:53.15]I'll see you next time.
[89:55.75]All right.
[89:56.25]Well, thanks for having me, man.
[89:57.71]And I look forward to the next time we, you know, work it out.
[90:06.90]Yeah, that'll be fun.
[90:09.25]All right, well, I'll see you later, and I'll see your tiny little baby hands.
[90:15.53]Has it left?
[90:15.99]All right, he said hands.
[90:21.56]I thought he was going somewhere else, so that's why it immediately left.
[90:26.60]All right, let's move on and do something else.
[90:28.76]We'll do that again, and this time we will reverse the rolls next time.
[90:34.66]I'm going to be right back.
[90:36.87]Oh, now I can click on the... I have my water dissolve set up wrong.
[90:40.03]Give me, like, a few minutes.
[90:42.55]I'm going to switch over to something else.
[90:44.55]I'll be right back.
