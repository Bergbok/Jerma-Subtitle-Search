[00:08.82]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.37]Jerma here with one of the weirdest games I've ever played in my entire life.
[00:14.73]This is Pac-Man 2, The New Adventures.
[00:17.79]And if you don't know what this game is, then you are in for a treat.
[00:21.67]You're in for quite a surprise, mainly because of the game's gameplay.
[00:26.09]It doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:28.35]I'm not going to spoil it.
[00:29.36]You'll see it in just a second.
[00:30.36]I'm going to go into the live commentary here, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[00:33.88]And of course, take care, everybody.
[00:38.29]So, as you can probably imagine, this game is not Pac-Man.
[00:41.87]This has nothing to do with the old Pac-Mans.
[00:44.90]This is, like, I have a baby, I have a wife, that's Ms.
[00:47.64]Pac-Man, I'm assuming.
[00:49.78]We're out of milk and Pac-Baby's still hungry.
[00:52.24]Can you go get some more milk, please?
[00:56.20]Sure, I guess, why not?
[00:57.76]No problem.
[00:59.54]Welcome to Pac-Man 2 The New Adventures.
[01:02.55]So let me break down the controls real quickly here.
[01:04.77]I move this cursor around, and I can either shoot a slingshot to, like, get his attention, and make him stop moving, like, for instance.
[01:12.13]That didn't work.
[01:13.76]He just got really happy.
[01:15.14]Stop.
[01:15.38]No, no, no, stop moving, stop moving, stop moving.
[01:17.04]I have to, like, do this.
[01:19.10]Okay, you're safe now.
[01:20.74]So you have to interact with the world around Pac-Man to... What the fuck are you doing?
[01:27.17]You're supposed to go that way.
[01:29.96]Pac-Man has the attention span of a goldfish in like the first grade.
[01:38.99]Alright, so you're getting happy.
[01:43.73]What was that face?
[01:50.48]No, go back.
[01:52.58]You're going the wrong way, stupid.
[01:55.40]He just did this, like, I don't know, like, he did this crazy, like, old man curled up litho.
[02:01.53]I want him to do that again.
[02:04.03]Go over and get the milk.
[02:07.59]You friggin' baby.
[02:10.03]Oh, look, it's a chicken.
[02:12.53]Get the chicken.
[02:13.99]Shoot the chicken.
[02:14.83]Alright, get it.
[02:20.90]I'm not exactly sure what the whole point of this game is.
[02:24.10]Because it... I'm sure it's becoming very evident right now, guys.
[02:28.06]They thought... Namco thought it was... Are you serious?
[02:32.19]Did he just seriously walk into that?
[02:33.93]What an idiot!
[02:35.91]I just walk into something, let me have one of these.
[02:40.29]No, go... Go over here.
[02:43.80]Go to the hot dog man.
[02:46.34]You pissy bitch, just go this way and look up.
[02:49.54]Talk to him.
[02:51.60]Do you not see the hot dog man?
[02:53.60]Oh, did you finally see him?
[02:56.38]How do you not see this hot dog guy?
[02:58.78]Are you kidding me right now?
[03:00.84]I just pissed him off.
[03:06.10]What just made him so happy?
[03:09.77]Why can I not just control him?
[03:11.67]Why didn't they make a platformer?
[03:14.28]Why did they not make this game a platformer?
[03:16.67]Why is it, like, a point-and-click, like, follow the moron around and make him, like, look at stuff and get scared by, like, animals?
[03:28.43]Nobody has any mail for Pac-Man?
[03:34.09]I love that face so much.
[03:36.45]I love everything about that face.
[03:37.89]Eat the apple.
[03:42.29]Eat it.
[03:43.15]You know, it's good.
[03:44.01]It's delicious.
[03:46.19]Alright, now sneak by this dog.
[03:49.40]Be careful.
[03:50.30]Look at the dog.
[03:52.36]You just had an apple.
[03:53.52]You fucking idiot!
[03:55.34]I just... I didn't tell you to do that!
[03:59.02]Read the sign.
[04:01.69]He is so happy, he doesn't even care that this could be, like, dangerous.
[04:07.15]Grab that apple.
[04:09.59]Pick it up.
[04:12.21]What the fuck was that?
[04:17.13]What the fuck are you doing?
[04:23.82]Why did he just scream?
[04:27.34]What was the point?
[04:29.36]Who screams?
[04:30.32]Who screams for no reason?
[04:32.98]Who screams?
[04:44.07]Now he's depressed.
[04:47.58]Where are you going?
[04:49.06]Where is he going?
[04:53.86]Oh, yeah, you should have looked out for that.
[04:55.40]Yeah, you should have paid attention to your surroundings, you idiot.
[05:01.09]Look, look, look, look, look.
[05:01.85]Don't trip, don't trip.
[05:03.25]You see it?
[05:04.67]Okay, step over it.
[05:06.49]Yeah, it's a skateboard.
[05:08.07]Get on the skateboard.
[05:10.59]Go have some fun for once in your life.
[05:14.01]It's still telling me to get the milk.
[05:16.63]Alright, go get the milk.
[05:17.81]Go get the milk.
[05:20.67]I need to do some chain of... Go get the milk.
[05:23.51]Go that... Yes.
[05:24.65]Yes.
[05:25.39]Yes.
[05:26.63]This way.
[05:28.77]Sure.
[05:29.15]I know you're upset.
[05:31.34]I would be upset too if I tripped on a rock and screamed at a bird for seemingly absolutely no... Oh my fucking god.
[05:41.85]Pac-Man's very chaotic life is kind of like managing a sim.
[05:47.46]When you have a sim that is unhappy, they don't go to work right, they don't perform well, they have bad... Oh shit, hold on.
[05:54.28]Okay, I don't want him to get in trouble by that.
[05:56.86]But when you have a sim, and they're not like at their peak happiness, you can't do anything with them.
[06:01.30]They don't want to do anything.
[06:02.06]They're too tired, they're too hungry.
[06:04.18]I at least have all my bars filled up.
[06:07.31]on the happiness and energy meter.
[06:08.85]So I should be able to do this now.
[06:10.70]Pick up the milk.
[06:13.26]Please.
[06:16.72]Oh my... Stop whistling to yourself and pick the milk up.
[06:21.14]Please.
[06:22.26]Please pick up the... Please just stand... Stand... Get underneath it.
[06:30.35]There you go.
[06:30.61]Do you see it?
[06:30.95]Okay, you see it.
[06:33.87]Here we go.
[06:34.67]Bang.
[06:35.23]It worked.
[06:35.81]I'm gonna get the milk.
[06:37.97]I know I pissed him off in the process, but it's okay.
[06:39.97]Just get your composure together.
[06:41.67]Get yourself together, Pac-Man.
[06:43.33]And pick up the milk and go get the milk.
[06:49.01]Watch out!
[06:49.39]Don't trip on the rock.
[06:54.38]Alright, get on the skateboard.
[06:57.36]Actually ride the skateboard.
[06:59.96]There we go.
[07:00.52]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[07:11.18]I even told him to look, too, and he just didn't.
[07:17.21]I think he just has tunnel vision.
[07:21.67]Are you gonna actually listen to me this time?
[07:24.57]Look, look to the ground!
[07:25.63]Stop!
[07:26.11]Why are you riding a skateboard with your eyes closed?!
[07:28.31]What are you doing?! !
[07:31.39]Who closes their eyes and rides a skateboard?
[07:34.23]That's the dumbest thing I've ever fucking seen somebody do.
[07:37.17]Hey, yeah, I'm gonna get on a skateboard.
[07:38.49]Might as well close my eyes as tight as I can.
[07:40.72]This is ridiculous.
[07:47.90]How am I supposed to make him not close his eyes?
[07:52.58]Here he goes again.
[07:53.64]Closing his eyes.
[07:55.06]What if I shoot him?
[07:55.68]Will he, like, open his eyes?
[07:58.14]Hey, there we go.
[07:58.94]Alright.
[08:01.60]So to get him to... Yeah, yeah, thanks.
[08:10.07]Does this honestly surprise you every time?
[08:13.09]This can't surprise you every time it happens.
[08:16.97]I wonder if he's gonna stop and, like, look at the cow for the fourth, fifth fucking time in a row.
[08:21.67]Hey, look, I love cows.
[08:23.17]Hey, let me stop and, like, look at the bird, too.
[08:25.43]Because, like, I've never seen a bird before.
[08:27.75]Is there another bird in here?
[08:31.04]Yes!
[08:32.11]Birds!
[08:33.93]Oh, look, another bird!
[08:35.19]Isn't that wonderful?
[08:36.19]Go!
[08:37.45]Go!
[08:41.25]That's a nice walk you got there, Pac-Man.
[08:42.93]Nice high-legged walk.
[08:44.03]Yo, yes, you want a hot dog?
[08:45.69]Oh, yes, I'd love hot dogs!
[08:47.35]Mmm!
[08:52.58]You cat son of a bitch.
[08:57.00]What are you doing?
[08:57.76]What is he doing?
[08:58.78]What is he doing?
[09:00.73]Get the cat.
[09:09.82]No, no, no, no, no.
[09:10.80]Don't get another one.
[09:11.64]He's gonna spray you.
[09:12.38]He's gonna spray you with ketchup.
[09:15.73]Eat the pill.
[09:16.27]It'll make you feel better.
[09:18.51]Oh my god.
