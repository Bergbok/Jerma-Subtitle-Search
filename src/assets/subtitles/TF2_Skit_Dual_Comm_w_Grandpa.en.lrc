[00:10.63]What is going on, everybody?
[00:11.71]Jerma here again.
[00:12.99]This time I am going to be doing a dual commentary with somebody very special in my life.
[00:18.24]I'm going to be doing a dual comm with my grandfather.
[00:21.34]Yes, he is.
[00:21.98]So, Grandpa, if you'd like to introduce yourself right now is a pretty good time.
[00:25.97]Okay.
[00:26.59]Go ahead.
[00:27.01]Hi, I'm Jeremy's grandfather.
[00:29.75]This is Alfred Google.
[00:30.73]He is my grandpa of 87 years.
[00:33.27]That's right.
[00:33.79]He's been here a long time, and he loves to game, which is ridiculous.
[00:37.68]I love it.
[00:38.32]It's my favorite thing.
[00:40.18]Video games are the best thing in the world, especially Super Mario 3.
[00:44.16]Naturally, yeah.
[00:45.38]That's the best game I've ever played, probably in my life.
[00:49.43]And today I'm going to play some Team Fortress.
[00:54.05]What are we playing today?
[00:55.44]We are playing Team Fortress 2, Grandpa.
[00:57.70]This is the game I was telling you about, the one I'm doing online and stuff like that.
[01:00.98]You know, I was telling you about it earlier.
[01:02.78]Yep, I remember.
[01:03.40]So anyways, you're going to be playing what?
[01:05.83]What?
[01:06.33]As what class, I mean.
[01:07.25]Sorry.
[01:07.89]I'm playing as the soldier with the rocket launcher.
[01:11.21]It's a fucking huge... Soldier, you couldn't swear.
[01:13.41]Oh, shit.
[01:14.09]Okay.
[01:14.51]It's okay.
[01:14.93]You can't swear.
[01:15.55]I'm sorry.
[01:16.47]Sorry I didn't mean to talk like that.
[01:18.70]I'm not a sailor.
[01:19.64]It's all right.
[01:20.22]I'm not a sailor by any means.
[01:22.86]Let me get into the game here.
[01:24.20]What is this?
[01:24.74]You got to click on join.
[01:27.60]Yeah, okay.
[01:28.20]Okay, here it is.
[01:29.24]He's got it.
[01:29.92]Give him a second.
[01:30.46]He's got it.
[01:30.88]It might take me a second or two, but once I figure it out, I've almost swore right there again for like the fourth time.
[01:37.51]Almost.
[01:38.05]But it takes me a second.
[01:39.79]But once I get in the zone, I really start to kill people.
[01:44.55]And if you saw my last video, I used to do videos for Insane Aquarium.
[01:48.64]Nobody saw that.
[01:49.26]On my old channel.
[01:50.64]The channel was YouTube.com slash Grandpa Dickhead.
[01:55.12]But I can't use that name anymore because I'm not allowed to use that name.
[01:58.80]I told you, easy.
[01:59.38]But now I'm on Jeremy's channel for good now.
[02:02.31]I'm going to do commentaries with him every single day.
[02:06.09]So hopefully you do.
[02:06.89]I don't know about that.
[02:08.23]No.
[02:08.49]Maybe soon.
[02:08.99]Yeah, well, when we can, when we can do commentaries together, I'll make sure to bring my A game.
[02:14.54]Well, good.
[02:14.88]Hopefully you brought your A game today because you're going to need it because this game's not that easy when you first start out.
[02:20.46]You've seen me play it before.
[02:21.45]You know what I'm talking about.
[02:23.16]You're talking to somebody that beat Donkey Kong in five minutes, okay?
[02:28.40]Don't even try and tell me that I'm some kind of noob at this game.
[02:31.64]I bet you I could beat you in a duel one-on-one.
[02:34.54]I know what duels are.
[02:35.48]I looked up.
[02:36.04]I did my research.
[02:37.20]You did.
[02:37.54]You were on the computer for like three hours.
[02:39.04]I'll come out of the spawn here.
[02:42.36]What is this guy doing?
[02:43.38]That's a heavy.
[02:44.42]I want to be that guy.
[02:45.26]I'm going to be that guy.
[02:46.06]I changed my mind.
[02:47.46]I want to be this guy.
[02:48.54]Okay, well, go on the spawn.
[02:49.84]There you go.
[02:51.08]Okay, this guy looks like he's the biggest guy in the game, so I'm going to play with him.
[02:56.59]He's slow, though.
[02:57.57]He's pretty slow.
[02:58.25]So tell me what should I play?
[03:00.04]How do I play this guy?
[03:01.14]Should I be like a superhero and just jump at people and attack them?
[03:04.40]Yeah, that's the heavy.
[03:05.78]I'm going to go this way.
[03:07.13]No, don't...
[03:08.41]No, no, this is a tactical way.
[03:11.11]I'm telling you, this is the way you go if you want to be tactical.
[03:13.71]Listen, Grandpa, if you go that, that's the wrong way.
[03:16.35]You have to turn around.
[03:18.18]If you stand still any longer, you're going to get backstabbed by a spy.
[03:20.76]I'm just telling you.
[03:21.54]What the fuck is a spy?
[03:23.64]A spy, okay, I have to explain to you the game before you do anything stupid.
[03:28.11]Well, do it.
[03:28.81]You're playing under my name right now.
[03:30.43]I don't want people to think that this is some idiot.
[03:34.23]Who took over Germa's account or something?
[03:36.15]Listen, if you listen to me, you'll be fine.
[03:38.17]I'll listen.
[03:39.29]Tell me what you want me to tell me.
[03:40.63]I'm sitting here.
[03:41.41]Okay, all right.
[03:42.13]So this is Dust Bowl.
[03:43.83]This is probably the easiest map to learn because there's only one way people can go.
[03:48.67]Turn around, walk straight, and you've got to follow your teammates.
[03:52.26]Just follow where they're going.
[03:53.58]You'll get to the enemy team.
[03:54.54]You're on red.
[03:56.04]I'm going to shoot him.
[03:57.58]Don't shoot at people on red.
[03:59.04]You're on red.
[03:59.54]I'm going to shoot this guy.
[04:00.72]So get out here.
[04:01.38]There you go.
[04:02.12]All right, fine.
[04:03.18]And then just, yeah, okay, yeah.
[04:05.26]Oh, the blue team.
[04:07.06]Oh, my God.
[04:09.16]Oh, get old, you motherfucker.
[04:12.00]You're dead.
[04:13.23]You are dead, you shithead.
[04:15.01]No, no, no, no, no.
[04:17.37]Don't go up the stairs.
[04:18.55]I'll go up the stairs if I want to.
[04:21.67]I'm going to punch this fucking guy.
[04:23.43]All right, stop swearing, please.
[04:25.89]You're going to get me in trouble.
[04:27.03]I'm sorry.
[04:28.11]I can't help it.
[04:28.80]I grew up in L.A.
[04:29.96]All right, well, just come down the stairs.
[04:33.08]There you go.
[04:34.04]Who's that guy?
[04:35.00]Get that guy.
[04:35.52]Get him.
[04:36.00]I'm trying to shoot him.
[04:36.94]He's running away.
[04:38.26]get him yeah he's dead I did that you didn't do it okay so should I walk to this well platformer take out your sandwich and eat it if you go hit two I'm gonna die two is your secondary and that's okay right now it's there's a bunch of different items but I'm not even gonna pretend I'm like I can explain that to you so just hit two and then eat the sandwich what's the best item in the game
[05:00.66]Yeah, make sure you're in a spot that's, like, safe, though.
[05:02.28]Don't just stand still.
[05:03.50]Yeah, but what's the best item in the game?
[05:05.41]I kind of want to know because maybe I want it.
[05:09.03]All right, fine.
[05:09.63]I'll leave it.
[05:10.03]As you guys can tell, it's really hard to play with him.
[05:13.69]Oh, yeah.
[05:14.63]Anything.
[05:15.29]Yeah, okay.
[05:15.87]Says you.
[05:16.51]The hardest person to play with.
[05:17.75]No, it's hard to play with you.
[05:19.89]Any game.
[05:20.43]No, it's not.
[05:21.43]I mean, it's easy.
[05:22.27]Especially a game like this.
[05:23.41]Like, I...
[05:24.63]Especially a game like that.
[05:25.53]Well, then why am I playing then?
[05:26.64]Maybe I should just quit and go back to writing my book.
[05:29.12]No.
[05:30.02]The title is not written yet, so don't even ask.
[05:33.12]Okay.
[05:33.48]But I... Oh, watch out for this guy right here.
[05:36.34]He looks like he's pretty mad.
[05:37.72]You're good.
[05:38.30]You're good.
[05:38.58]You're good.
[05:38.98]So what's the best... I want to talk about what the best item in the entire game is.
[05:42.52]What is it?
[05:43.18]Well... What do you think the best item in the game is?
[05:45.58]There is none, to be honest.
[05:46.70]I think it's...
[05:48.12]It's the Razorback.
[05:49.60]That thing looks really cool.
[05:51.21]All right, well, you couldn't be any more wrong.
[05:54.39]I don't think I am.
[05:55.75]All the items are good.
[05:57.15]I mean, I say the Razorback is not, but, no, whatever.
[06:00.25]If you like the item, use it.
[06:01.77]It's all about preference.
[06:02.61]You say a lot of dumb things.
[06:04.11]You're not going to play this game ever again, so I don't have to tell you any of this.
[06:07.53]So just keep playing, and I don't have to explain this to you because you're going to forget in, like, five minutes.
[06:13.23]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[06:15.35]I am not going to forget this in five minutes.
[06:17.67]I already forgot what you told me five minutes ago, but that doesn't mean I'm going to forget what you just said five minutes from now.
[06:22.12]What do you think this is?
[06:22.98]Some kind of game?
[06:24.06]Even though we are playing a game.
[06:25.68]I'm telling you right now, I won't forget any of this.
[06:29.82]I'm going to come on Team Fortress tomorrow, and I'm going to play, and I'm going to be the best damn sorcerer anyone's ever seen.
[06:37.85]And if you don't think that's true, then you can stuff it.
[06:41.09]Brother.
[06:41.35]Oh, all right.
[06:43.33]That's fine.
[06:44.01]Yeah.
[06:44.61]Just, you know, you can play on your own now.
[06:46.41]I'll let you play on your own since you don't need my help and you don't think anything I say is worthwhile anyways.
[06:51.32]I don't need your help.
[06:52.16]I'm going to leave and hopefully you can figure it out on your own because I'm not going to sit here and baby you anymore because obviously you don't need that, right?
[06:59.00]You're a baby, not me.
[06:59.94]So anyways, take care, guys.
[07:02.04]I'll see you at the live stream Saturday.
[07:03.90]Big birthday party.
[07:04.92]Hell yeah, let's do it.
[07:06.04]I'm going to be there.
[07:06.63]No, you're not going to be there.
[07:07.63]What?
[07:07.89]No.
[07:09.15]Why would you be there?
[07:10.13]Because it's... You're going to be at Grandma's anyways.
[07:11.93]You're going to be at John's.
[07:13.77]Oh, okay.
[07:14.87]Yeah, so... But dinner sucks over there.
[07:17.80]No, you're doing family dinner there.
[07:19.28]Yeah, but dinner sucks over there.
[07:21.26]I want to eat with you tomorrow.
[07:23.26]I don't want to be over there.
[07:24.24]That place sucks.
[07:25.66]Well, I mean, if you want to come to the live stream for like a few minutes or something.
[07:30.14]Okay.
[07:30.68]By all means, you can come, but you can't hang out all night because, I don't know.
[07:34.85]Why the hell not?
[07:35.87]You just can't hang out all night.
[07:37.63]That's it.
[07:38.27]All right, fine.
[07:38.85]So, bye, guys.
[07:40.51]I'll see you all tomorrow at the live stream.
[07:42.93]Peace.
[07:43.43]Okay.
[07:43.93]See you later.
[07:46.35]I'll see you later.
[07:47.62]Yeah.
[07:47.94]Hey, just make sure... I might have... Just shut the computer down when you're done, because I'm not going to come back in here.
[07:55.24]What?
[07:55.54]Shut the computer down when you're done.
[07:57.60]Oh, okay.
[07:58.30]I'll shut the computer off.
[07:59.45]See you later.
[07:59.93]Bye.
[08:00.45]All right.
[08:00.77]See you later.
[08:01.35]I love you, son.
[08:03.41]Or grandson.
[08:04.31]Oh, God.
[08:06.35]I'm going to puke.
[08:07.53]So, anyways, I'll see you guys next time on...
[08:11.29]My grandpa plays with me today.
[08:15.24]I don't even know if that's going to be the title or not, but it should be.
[08:18.62]Okay.
[08:20.34]Salute United States of America.
[08:23.61]What the hell am I talking about?
[08:25.39]Okay.
[08:25.95]Bye, guys.
[08:26.73]See you later.
