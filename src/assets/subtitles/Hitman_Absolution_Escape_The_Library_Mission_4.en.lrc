[00:08.68]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.22]Welcome back to Hitman Absolution.
[00:12.50]If you're just joining us, if you've never seen an episode before, then hello.
[00:15.80]Welcome to an episode of Hitman Absolution.
[00:18.16]I suggest you go back and watch the first four or five episodes.
[00:22.29]I think there's four right now.
[00:23.57]But let's get started here, escaping the library.
[00:26.15]Just got to get rid of all these coppers, or at least avoid these coppers.
[00:30.29]Let's see here.
[00:33.76]I actually do remember this from the gameplay demo they did a long time ago, but I don't remember exactly how to do this, so we'll see how this goes.
[00:44.88]Okay, what am I doing here?
[00:49.08]Get out!
[00:49.44]Why are these guys still standing here?
[00:51.95]Going like a coffee break.
[00:53.13]Get the hell out of here.
[00:54.93]I'm gonna drop a chandelier on your head.
[00:57.81]Now they're starting to move.
[00:58.53]Good, good, good.
[01:01.23]Should be able just to chill out somewhere.
[01:05.01]Right here seems good.
[01:05.90]Only one dude.
[01:10.20]Two guys over there, though.
[01:12.00]Scaring me.
[01:15.62]Maybe I can just go now?
[01:17.20]Let's go now.
[01:18.20]No, not now, not now.
[01:19.48]Wow.
[01:20.58]Wow, I almost just got spotted right there.
[01:26.03]How do I do?
[01:26.59]How am I supposed to just go?
[01:27.47]Hey, go, like, on patrol somewhere.
[01:31.91]Get the hell out of here.
[01:34.00]You prick.
[01:34.80]Get away from me.
[01:36.80]Here we go.
[01:37.14]He's leaving.
[01:39.84]Yeah, turn your back for two seconds and I'm out of here.
[01:44.30]Maybe not.
[01:44.68]He almost just saw me.
[01:47.32]What's that?
[01:49.40]There's a point of interest over here.
[01:55.60]Wow, don't move.
[01:56.42]I'm going to try and make my way over there.
[02:05.67]I don't really feel like going over here.
[02:07.19]Let's see.
[02:08.03]Can I make it over here without being spotted is the real question.
[02:13.25]Kind of.
[02:14.57]But I don't like being in this position.
[02:16.07]I don't like being in this position at all.
[02:18.55]These guys have to move.
[02:21.61]These guys have to move right now.
[02:24.94]Right now.
[02:28.82]Oh, these... I don't know where to go.
[02:31.12]Don't stand up!
[02:31.74]That would be a bad idea.
[02:32.74]Let me just stand up real quick.
[02:34.16]Hi.
[02:36.35]I wonder if I can still... Now where's he going?
[02:40.91]Go over there!
[02:42.91]Damn it!
[02:47.59]Maybe I can walk around this way?
[02:48.83]Is there anybody over here?
[02:50.66]No, this is not okay.
[02:54.38]Point shooting?
[02:54.94]I don't know how to do point shooting.
[02:56.74]Release light rig.
[03:00.90]Can I grab this without him seeing?
[03:04.04]I don't know if I can.
[03:04.80]I'm gonna be spotted if I walk over here.
[03:08.29]Do I have like a distraction thing?
[03:09.39]Like a bottle or something?
[03:12.53]Maybe he won't see me.
[03:15.97]Oh!
[03:16.25]He didn't see- Oh my god!
[03:19.25]Oh my god.
[03:22.07]Oh my word.
[03:23.04]Where are they going?
[03:24.78]This one guy's coming over here right now.
[03:28.58]Does he have any idea what's- Can I go behind him?
[03:32.50]Holy crap.
[03:35.62]Holy crap.
[03:39.62]What's that guy just standing there for?
[03:40.86]Get out of here, man.
[03:41.48]Don't just stand there.
[03:43.50]Holy, holy hell.
[03:44.62]Holy hell.
[03:45.06]This guy's coming over here right now.
[03:46.32]Holy hand grenade.
[03:47.74]Holy hell.
[03:48.53]Don't see me.
[03:49.21]Do you know what, man?
[03:54.51]No, that's not what I wanted to do.
[04:00.35]This is ridiculous.
[04:04.21]How on Earth...
[04:08.18]There's a hiding place right here.
[04:12.11]Guy right here.
[04:12.87]Can I... Can I subdue this guy without this one seeing?
[04:20.83]This guy's gotta move.
[04:23.65]Okay.
[04:24.57]Here we go.
[04:25.81]Moment of truth.
[04:27.07]Moment of truth.
[04:28.61]Moment of truth.
[04:31.69]Moment of truth.
[04:33.37]Oh, here we go, boys.
[04:35.29]And or girls.
[04:44.30]Get back here.
[04:44.78]Get back here.
[04:45.20]Get back here.
[04:45.58]Get back here.
[04:45.96]Get back here.
[04:48.14]And nobody is the wiser.
[04:50.62]Give me your police disguise.
[04:53.67]And then you're going in here.
[04:55.49]I'm sorry.
[04:56.89]It was a necessary thing I had to do.
[05:00.09]The lights are all on.
[05:01.25]Alright.
[05:07.39]Alright.
[05:10.18]Should probably pick up his gun.
[05:11.64]What's Johnson's gun doing on the ground?
[05:13.82]I don't know.
[05:14.22]I have no idea.
[05:14.94]Something tells me I don't want to just walk by this guy.
[05:21.70]That would be a terrible idea.
[05:23.04]Let's go back the other way.
[05:24.50]Actually, you know what?
[05:25.09]Can I go up top?
[05:26.21]Would be probably a better decision.
[05:29.77]The lights are all just blaring right now.
[05:37.07]Holy crap.
[05:38.83]That's another officer.
[05:43.92]Why are you looking at the bookcases?
[05:46.00]This guy's looking for me in the bookcases.
[05:50.66]Like, he's looking at the books.
[05:52.85]I wonder.
[05:53.23]He might be inside of the books.
[05:54.63]He never can be too careful.
[05:58.01]This guy keeps on looking over here.
[06:01.49]You know what?
[06:02.19]I am going to go back down.
[06:03.43]I'm going to go break those lights.
[06:05.48]I remember seeing that.
[06:06.32]There's one guy here.
[06:15.21]I should be able to get behind him.
[06:17.99]No, I don't even need to do that.
[06:18.87]I can probably just, you know what?
[06:20.41]I can probably just stand up and fake my way around.
[06:24.91]Put the gun away, though.
[06:28.09]Yep.
[06:28.93]Let's move back this way into the darkness.
[06:33.96]I might even want to just get rid of this guy.
[06:35.92]Seriously.
[06:37.18]Oh, crap.
[06:42.47]Let's try this again.
[06:43.55]This time let's be a little bit more sneaky about it, please.
[06:47.35]And thank you.
[06:50.91]Back is turned.
[06:52.10]That guy's back is also turned.
[06:53.46]Can I climb through here?
[06:54.76]No, I can't.
[06:56.94]And I broke it.
[06:57.58]There we go.
[07:07.38]There we go.
[07:09.99]There we go.
[07:11.29]Oh, boy.
[07:15.16]This guy's coming back this way?
[07:17.78]Damn it.
[07:19.36]Just hang out over there, dude.
[07:20.72]Just hang out over there.
[07:22.40]Be cool.
[07:24.58]We'll all be cool.
[07:25.66]These guys are seeing me now.
[07:28.54]I might just be able to walk by.
[07:29.66]Let's see if I can just... No, I gotta crouch back underneath here.
[07:33.02]Wait for this guy to walk.
[07:33.90]Is he walking out?
[07:34.52]Go out.
[07:35.22]Go out and talk to your friend.
[07:37.20]That's what I'm talking about.
[07:41.21]That's what I'm talking about.
[07:45.88]Sabotage the lights.
[07:46.88]Nobody see me.
[07:48.56]Yes.
[07:49.44]Yes.
[07:49.78]That's what I'm talking about.
[07:55.32]No.
[07:55.64]Don't look at me.
[07:56.66]I'm a cop too.
[08:00.29]Don't look at me.
[08:03.53]Good.
[08:04.05]Good.
[08:04.33]So far so good.
[08:05.25]I'm going to go up the stairs now.
[08:08.13]Both backs turned.
[08:09.68]Yep.
[08:11.57]Let's go up the stairs.
[08:14.51]I'm a cop.
[08:15.15]Don't worry.
[08:15.57]I'm a police officer.
[08:16.41]Just doing my job.
[08:17.53]Looking up here.
[08:18.21]Wow.
[08:21.56]How is this other guy?
[08:23.66]Still looking back there.
[08:27.50]Man, I can't go out there.
[08:28.73]I can't go anywhere.
[08:33.97]You bastards.
[08:39.27]I need to, I need to, like, throw this guy off the balcony.
[08:42.15]He's just annoying the hell out of me.
[08:46.88]It looks like... I could go over that way.
[08:54.68]This guy's still... Can I, maybe if I crouch, I can, maybe he won't see me if I do this.
[08:59.08]No, okay.
[09:00.89]I can be sneaky about this.
[09:04.99]See ya.
[09:06.45]Wouldn't wanna be ya.
[09:09.90]Let's make our way.
[09:11.48]Holy damn it.
[09:15.78]I really don't think you would survive that drop.
[09:19.86]Pull this out.
[09:20.66]You could slip and die.
[09:35.61]Alright, I definitely am supposed to go down this way and drop down.
[09:39.37]Thanks for telling me what to do.
[09:45.59]This guy turns his back.
[09:51.16]Go look in that hole again.
[09:52.28]Didn't it look, like, cool?
[09:53.52]Wasn't it, like, weird looking?
[09:55.50]Go, like, tell me how it looks.
[09:59.28]Nope, not yet.
[10:01.10]Man, they don't really know how to play tricks on you in this game.
[10:03.04]I would have just dropped down there and gotten instantly murdered.
[10:10.21]There's no way I'm going to take out that guy unless he turns around and this guy's not looking.
[10:16.86]You know what?
[10:17.20]Maybe I can push him in there.
[10:26.58]He fell in the hole!
[10:28.68]Nice!
[10:29.58]Good.
[10:30.09]Good.
[10:30.63]Grand.
[10:32.35]Great, grand, wonderful.
[10:33.33]Alright, don't freak out here.
[10:34.35]My blood's kind of like shaking right now.
[10:36.81]Give me the hammer.
[10:39.79]Don't lose it here.
[10:40.67]Don't, like, freak out.
[10:42.17]I am nervous as hell right now, man.
[10:44.54]Alright, what's down... Holy crap, get in here.
[10:51.86]Get in.
[10:52.08]Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[10:55.88]Whew.
[11:00.94]Holy hell.
[11:05.39]I don't even know if I should get out right now.
[11:08.60]I really don't know if I should get out, because if I get out, he might just turn around.
[11:13.73]Way's like the strategy guide when you need it.
[11:18.05]Looks like he's going down here.
[11:22.59]This might be the best time to go.
[11:24.05]Let's see where he stops.
[11:30.78]Keep you back.
[11:31.30]Turn.
[11:31.70]Going out now.
[11:34.72]Yep, there we go.
[11:35.50]Okay.
[11:35.60]Okay.
[11:41.11]Okay.
[11:50.77]Change cover.
[11:54.35]Go!
[11:59.08]Um... No!
[12:02.00]What are you doing?!
[12:04.76]I wanna, like, get out of cover, not, like, do that!
[12:06.94]There we go, it's space.
[12:11.80]Go through here.
[12:12.72]Let's make it.
[12:16.52]Can I climb through?
[12:20.44]One guy.
[12:24.18]There's the end.
[12:24.88]Right there.
[12:25.37]I'm almost done.
[12:26.11]Yikes.
[12:38.11]This is the only guy.
[12:38.93]Gonna go around this way.
[12:46.77]Is his back turned?
[12:47.63]His back?
[12:48.03]This guy's back is turned.
[12:51.43]Oh, damn it.
[12:52.37]Oh, damn it.
[12:52.81]Oh, damn it.
[12:53.19]Oh, damn it.
[12:53.55]Oh, damn it.
[12:59.16]There he goes.
[13:00.34]His root looks like it goes all the way down.
[13:04.32]Perfect.
[13:06.48]Let's get out of here.
[13:11.00]Seriously, get me out of here.
[13:12.34]This guy's looking this way.
[13:14.85]Get me out of here.
[13:17.58]Oh, damn it!
[13:21.46]Oh, I don't know.
[13:22.00]I don't know.
[13:22.66]I don't know.
[13:23.30]I don't know.
[13:23.76]He's coming all the way back here.
[13:24.94]He's coming all the way back here.
[13:27.35]Yeah, you do know me from somewhere.
[13:28.55]Oh, I gotta go up here.
[13:33.75]Okay.
[13:37.10]Oh my word!
[13:40.79]This is it.
[13:41.77]Where's this guy coming?
[13:43.36]I don't know this guy's route.
[13:44.40]I don't know this guy's route.
[13:45.50]I don't know this guy's freaking route.
[13:47.42]Oh no.
[13:50.30]Stop right there.
[13:51.00]Yes.
[13:52.66]So lucky.
[14:04.14]I can't believe I just did that.
[14:06.20]I cannot believe I just did that.
[14:13.77]How did this guy not just see me right there, dude?
[14:23.72]It's impossible.
[14:26.38]It is impossible that I just did not get spotted.
[14:29.46]Release this.
[14:34.76]What just happened?
[14:38.99]I have no idea what just happened, but I need to go out that door.
[14:49.99]Can I make it across here?
[14:55.96]Oh, come on, man.
[14:57.74]Are you serious?
[15:01.88]If I drop down here, where can I go?
[15:09.51]It's just a question of whether or not I can get past these two guys.
[15:11.75]I wish I had that hammer still.
[15:16.77]Make things a lot easier.
[15:17.79]Let's just walk by.
[15:21.95]No, not this way.
[15:29.94]I might be able just to tactically move around up there.
[15:34.00]You know what?
[15:34.40]Let's do this.
[15:38.38]Sayonara, sucka.
[15:42.65]Nope.
[15:43.09]Bad idea.
[15:43.59]Is there like a book I can pick up?
[15:49.70]These guys follow the same route, it seems.
[15:53.70]It's just a question of outmaneuvering these two buttheads.
[16:01.39]One guy's here, one guy's there.
[16:03.77]Let's go.
[16:04.31]Let's go.
[16:04.83]I'm just going for it.
[16:05.87]I'm going for it, baby.
[16:16.77]Oh, dear.
[16:17.71]I made it.
[16:19.59]I made it out the door.
[16:24.25]Now what?
[16:26.79]Looks like I can go up top.
[16:28.92]Nobody up here.
[16:29.50]I can start running.
[16:31.64]Whoa.
[16:35.84]This place is completely empty.
[16:41.32]Jump up.
[16:45.36]Nobody up here, right?
[16:46.32]I don't want to, like, walk into someone.
[16:51.07]So what do I do here?
[16:51.81]I have to, like... What's this?
[16:54.53]Release the chandelier.
[16:56.49]Releasing this will likely cause fatalities.
[17:00.17]Well, don't I want, like, the silent assassin?
[17:04.50]Oh, I already, like, killed that guy.
[17:05.80]Uh, what if I just, like, walk out the door?
[17:09.24]What if I, like, just say no to killing these people?
[17:12.04]Because they're just police officers.
[17:13.18]They didn't do no harm.
[17:16.54]Wait a minute.
[17:17.64]Let's see if I can just go around this way.
[17:19.70]I can't.
[17:20.10]I have to drop that chandelier.
[17:21.84]How am I supposed... I don't want to kill these people.
[17:27.13]The game is making me kill these guys.
[17:29.25]I don't want to.
[17:31.47]Oh.
[17:32.17]Right.
[17:32.64]I can just walk by it.
[17:33.48]Right.
[17:34.64]Right.
[17:37.39]Bang, baby.
[17:38.43]Bang.
[17:40.37]And that is going to wrap up the episode, so thank you all so much for watching.
[17:43.71]I really do appreciate it.
[17:44.99]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[17:46.67]And if you do like the series, please go ahead and throw me a like or a comment or something like that, because it does motivate me to record more of these episodes.
[17:53.38]So again, I'll see you guys all soon.
[17:54.76]Thank you so much for watching, and take care, everybody.
[17:58.46]Ow!
