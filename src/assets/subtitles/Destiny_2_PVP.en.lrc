[ve:60.16.100]

[04:13.15]Hey, what's up everybody?
[04:14.31]I told you I'd be back and here I am.
[04:16.79]I gotta say I feel like a new man after the last show.
[04:20.45]I feel reinvigorated.
[04:22.86]I feel HD.
[04:24.94]I feel like Jerma.
[04:27.68]So I want to give a huge shout out to all the actors that made it to the competition.
[04:33.22]Unfortunately, none of them won.
[04:35.30]I am still here.
[04:36.36]I still reign supreme.
[04:38.20]I want to give a huge shout out to Ludwig.
[04:40.56]Always good to see him.
[04:42.51]It was a crazy show.
[04:43.65]What can I say?
[04:45.11]But I'm glad I'm still here and I'm glad I'm still with all of you.
[04:49.39]That number 13 guy though, I don't know what he was thinking.
[04:52.65]He thought he could take my spot.
[04:54.61]Instead he kind of showed up just looking like a poor man's Andrew Garfield and good riddance.
[05:00.83]I don't know too, like some of his stuff, the nunchucks, really?
[05:05.07]this day and age.
[05:06.83]And how old was that guy?
[05:08.27]He looked 25 going on 50.
[05:09.87]It's like, I'm glad you could do a cartwheel, but don't break a hip, old man, you know?
[05:15.73]So, speaking of which, I am a new man.
[05:19.20]I'm here to do something that I said that I would never do, and that's to play Destiny 2.
[05:25.80]I know, I said I'd never do it, but here we are.
[05:29.63]And I wanna give a big thanks to Stir and Doctor.
[05:33.17]I wanna give a big thanks to the Doctor for showing up.
[05:38.42]You guys are the best and you help make the magic happen.
[05:41.78]So let's do it without further ado.
[05:46.72]Okay.
[05:51.50]All right, what do we got here?
[05:55.72]That looks good.
[06:00.63]Let me hit launch.
[06:07.50]Oh, nice.
[06:13.14]So, I hate being forced to do this.
[06:16.21]This game is just insane, but...
[06:20.38]It's big.
[06:21.18]Sooner or later, I guess it had to happen.
[06:23.08]But I got to tell you, I'm not happy about it.
[06:25.67]Pretty much every fiber of my being is just right now.
[06:30.37]But got to make you guys happy.
[06:31.99]So let's go.
[06:37.08]I mean, honestly, I'm only doing this because I feel fresh.
[06:41.06]I mean, granted, my back hurts after all that breakdancing.
[06:44.79]But, I mean, I keep telling myself I'm not going to breakdance anymore.
[06:48.89]But, you know, when you wear a leprechaun pimp outfit that shines like that, how can you not bust the move?
[06:55.60]Seriously.
[07:06.74]Whoa.
[07:09.86]Here we go.
[07:12.96]Warp speed.
[07:22.51]This game takes forever to load.
[07:29.41]Piece of shit.
[07:34.54]Control.
[07:41.40]Dominus Cryo.
[07:49.82]The zones are yours if you fight for them, Guardian.
[07:54.10]Okay.
[07:55.32]Here we go.
[07:58.34]What level are these people?
[08:00.59]That guy's level 459?
[08:03.21]Enemy claim zone C. Yeah, this is much better with the controllers.
[08:21.26]I'm still on location.
[08:23.02]You captured zone C. You have zone advantage.
[08:37.57]Nice!
[08:37.99]Enemy claimed zone B. Enemy claimed zone B. Get some!
[09:06.65]I look like the Moon Knight.
[09:08.75]Zone C lost.
[09:10.05]Enemy has zone advantage.
[09:32.59]No, uh, no, no revenge this time.
[09:35.37]So now I gotta kill that motherfucker twice.
[09:37.13]There's a lion everywhere.
[09:49.12]In fact, I did some kind of a slide attack.
[09:53.70]I don't even know I can do that.
[10:11.38]Finally, son of a bitch.
[10:14.35]Aaron!
[10:15.61]Aaron!
[10:36.54]This game is crazy.
[10:41.76]Bug!
[10:43.34]Bug!
[10:43.80]I'm going to kill you if it's the last thing I do in Platinum Trickery.
[11:21.51]You know, considering how high level some of these people are, I'm not doing as bad as I thought I would.
[11:30.86]Yes!
[11:32.74]Blood for blood, love to see that.
[11:35.25]Why do these games have to be so violent?
[11:51.17]Especially great to see the doctor.
[11:53.25]I haven't seen him in almost three years now.
[11:58.39]It's been three years?
[12:02.49]That's crazy.
[12:04.83]Time just flies by.
[12:09.16]Time flies by and then someone named Hunkababy Brian shoots you in the face.
[12:14.76]That's life, kiddos.
[12:35.27]Is it turning into ice cubes?
[12:36.89]Breaking?
[12:44.30]Yeah, it's on.
[12:45.86]It's... Five minutes.
[13:01.95]get happy.
[13:03.55]I don't even know what the plot is.
[13:04.77]It looks like we're just here to turn each other into ice and shoot each other.
[13:14.00]And some kind of BDSM techno knife.
[13:35.15]Just a little bit quicker on the draw.
[13:40.25]Can anyone hear me?
[13:41.93]Can anyone hear me?
[13:42.89]Where am I?
[13:43.37]It's so cold in here!
[13:45.07]Hello?
[13:46.96]Is that the game?
[13:48.12]Did you guys hear that?
[14:06.85]All right, I guess they do talk.
[14:08.19]All right.
[14:10.38]You know, I think I've died enough.
[14:13.48]I think I'm going to relax on the bed.
[14:31.80]Zone C captured.
[14:33.12]You have zone advancing.
[14:36.12]We have zone advantage.
[14:39.58]Zone C lost.
[14:40.84]Enemy has advanced.
[14:42.32]Your enemy has defeated you.
[14:44.10]What?
[14:44.94]I just went from advantage to defeat within four seconds.
[14:47.78]What is that?
[14:51.77]You eat monsters for breakfast.
[14:53.77]You can win a battle for territory.
[14:56.21]Again.
[15:03.31]We lost!
[15:06.24]How much did we lose by?
[15:08.37]Yeah, look at that.
[15:13.29]Combat efficiency.
[15:15.67]Oh, let's not look at that score again.
[15:18.31]All right, well, I think I'm done dying for a little bit.
[15:24.50]I gotta go use the restroom.
[15:33.72]I know where I am.
[15:35.12]I know where I am.
[15:38.89]I am in the hotel room.
[15:43.01]I... No, no, it couldn't have happened, no!
[16:36.67]It's all I know how to do.
[16:39.15]I don't know how to do anything else.
[16:44.63]Where am I?
[16:45.57]I don't even know where I am.
[16:46.97]I'm in some type of in-between area.
[16:51.59]I'm gonna haunt these motherfuckers for the rest of their lives.
[16:54.73]I promise you.
[16:57.99]I'll haunt them forever.
[17:29.42]It feels like I just got done pissing a sailboat.
[17:37.93]I don't know what's wrong with me.
[17:42.27]All right.
[17:43.64]Let's try this again.
[17:44.82]This game has some weird audio.
[17:54.92]All right.
[17:57.19]Settings.
[18:07.15]We're ranked seven out of... All right.
[18:15.45]Dr. Chunk invited us to the clan.
[18:18.23]That must mean something good.
[18:20.37]We're not completely awful.
[18:23.50]All right.
[18:23.94]Well, I'm going to do something a little wild.
[18:28.36]I'm going to play backwards.
[18:31.88]Yeah, this is how it's done.
[18:39.11]I can do this with one hand behind my back.
[18:47.05]Shpee!
[18:49.65]That's the shpee ship.
[18:51.90]We're taking the shpee ship to war.
[18:59.60]Hey, thank you so much for the subs, guys.
[19:01.82]Keep them coming.
[19:05.43]Let's take the shpee ship.
[19:09.26]Keep them rolling.
[19:14.67]So we're guardians?
[19:17.79]What are we guarding?
[19:23.15]Whoa.
[19:25.79]Okay, that... What?
[19:27.62]Did you guys hear that?
[19:34.30]On the chat?
[19:35.76]It's not the game.
[19:38.13]Number 13.
[19:41.73]Number 13's not here.
[19:42.97]What the fuck am I talking to?
[19:49.42]Elimination.
[19:51.26]Yes, you are.
[19:54.76]No beginners here.
[19:55.92]Yes, front desk, please.
[19:57.18]Your team is relying on you.
[20:00.92]Hi.
[20:02.42]I've been hearing some strange noises in my room.
[20:07.22]Is there something wrong with the piping?
[20:09.18]That implies that Elvis is in purgatory.
[20:12.66]It sounded like a voice.
[20:13.72]I wonder why.
[20:16.20]I know it sounds crazy.
[20:21.13]Weird question.
[20:23.09]Has anyone died in here recently?
[20:25.55]Okay, sorry about that.
[20:32.28]Uh...
[20:48.53]Is this the guy who's been saying something the whole time?
[20:53.78]I'm sorry, guys.
[20:56.76]I'm hearing a voice that's not in the game.
[21:00.24]It doesn't sound like that guy.
[21:05.21]Okay.
[21:05.85]He'll never do his boss like he just did in front of him.
[21:14.69]Or that I could believe.
[21:17.83]Is there like a ghost in this game or something?
[21:20.87]Chat, is there a ghost in this game?
[21:23.10]There is a ghost in your room number 13.
[21:32.06]I'm not number 13, I'm Jerma!
[21:34.24]What the fuck am I talking to you?
[21:40.60]I'm just trying to play this game!
[21:43.50]We killed you 13!
[21:47.46]We killed you!
[21:49.42]Because sometimes you have to grow as a person!
[21:51.48]You can't always do the same thing!
[21:53.86]Okay guys, I'm really getting creeped out right now.
[22:13.51]He sounds just like me.
[22:16.00]On the plus side, at least we won.
[22:23.30]Hey.
[22:24.16]I have this image on the screen.
[22:28.74]It's a big, red, pulsating mass.
[22:32.91]You should probably look at it.
[22:37.13]Pulsating mass?
[22:45.72]What is that voice?
[22:47.50]God, it's getting cold in here.
[22:55.62]Peep at the horror.
[22:59.16]Looks like someone turned the temperature down in here.
[23:10.66]If they don't care that I'm freezing, they're just gonna shoot me anyway.
[23:13.22]Okay.
[23:13.60]I think it's gone now.
[23:41.04]Guys, this is the scariest stream I've ever done.
[23:43.24]It doesn't help because I haven't played this game before.
[23:46.68]I don't think I'll be playing it again, I'll tell you that.
[23:55.63]Alright.
[23:56.53]Well, weird stuff happens.
[23:59.93]Anyway.
[24:01.65]Let's talk about the show, huh?
[24:04.43]That was one of the craziest streams we've ever done.
[24:06.97]It was a lot of fun.
[24:10.19]Some of the actors, phenomenal talents.
[24:13.93]Those impressions.
[24:17.06]Some of the musicians, they needed a little help.
[24:20.40]Some of it was excellent.
[24:23.18]Really amazing.
[24:25.58]Meeting Connor was fun.
[24:28.75]Meeting Connor was an honor.
[24:31.61]That rhymes.
[24:32.89]I'm a poet, I didn't know it.
[24:47.78]All right.
[24:48.33]These guys jump.
[24:53.79]Every time I start to hit somebody, they jump.
[24:55.83]That's all right.
[24:57.11]Stand up and fight again.
[25:04.33]Your enemy combat efficiency zero.
[25:09.59]Zero.
[25:11.42]That's one less than one.
[25:17.52]No heavy ammo.
[25:19.32]Why does the ammo have to be heavy?
[25:24.24]Best serve cold.
[25:29.86]One opponent left.
[25:31.78]They don't stand a chance.
[25:34.75]They don't stand a chance!
[25:41.35]I'm not gonna show my feet.
[25:44.74]I'm not gonna show my feet!
[25:47.02]Trust me, you don't wanna see it.
[25:51.82]I've got hobbit feet.
[25:57.54]Gangly toenails.
[25:58.58]Yeah, let's try going a different way.
[26:04.71]Yeah, sneak up on him.
[26:11.69]It's like an office building in the future that's just been torn apart by warfare.
[26:18.96]Stop jumping!
[26:25.44]Come on.
[26:29.50]What is this?
[26:31.77]Your ally is only one left.
[26:34.75]Trust them to get this done.
[26:36.81]Only one enemy remains.
[26:38.01]That's how I feel right now.
[26:39.53]Don't let them catch their breath.
[26:41.32]That's how I feel right now.
[26:42.72]Only one enemy remains.
[26:44.84]Don't let them catch their breath.
[26:50.82]I'm not a ghost!
[26:51.32]This is freaky.
[26:51.88]I can't wait to get out of this hotel room.
[26:54.74]I don't even know.
[26:56.50]Show them what one guardian can do.
[27:04.97]Honestly though, I'm lasting longer than I thought I would.
[27:08.95]That's what she said.
[27:12.61]Triumph completed.
[27:13.69]Learn from this moment.
[27:17.09]This game sucks.
[27:24.81]Graphics are nice, but... Who wants to get killed in three seconds flat like this?
[27:33.33]Well, when I went on and on and said I would never play this game, now I know why.
[27:39.05]I'm always right.
[27:39.71]Even when I'm wrong, I'm right.
[27:44.01]Just like the talent show.
[27:46.39]You could say I was wrong.
[27:47.49]I didn't let anyone win.
[27:48.45]But you know what?
[27:50.19]I'm right.
[27:52.30]Might makes right.
[27:54.02]Winner, winner, chicken dinner, and who's sitting here?
[28:02.07]Yeah, I think we're gonna ban that guy that suggested it for an hour.
[28:06.15]Banned!
[28:10.45]Ban him.
[28:15.21]So this is the spaceship that just keeps taking me to my doom.
[28:20.28]Floating there like a high-tech car.
[28:28.94]Number 15.
[28:30.79]I finally was able to have enough energy to go through the first door.
[28:36.67]They have 10 locked doors, and I found a key.
[28:40.29]There's a whole game I'm playing with your number 13.
[28:45.02]I'm playing an escape room in purgatory, and you better believe when I get out of the second door, I'll have the power to do all kinds of other things.
[28:59.14]I would suggest, number 13, that you leave now.
[29:05.26]Leave this place and never return.
[29:11.20]But before you go, number 13, if you could possibly look under the bed and see if there's a number, because I'm missing the middle number in this box second door, and it might be under that one.
[29:31.74]If I do, will you leave me alone?
[29:33.78]Oh, I will leave you alone.
[29:37.26]Okay.
[29:40.21]Is there a number under that bed?
[29:42.27]Number 13.
[29:52.56]Go check.
[29:56.74]I can feel the chat now.
[30:05.32]It's one of those shitty hotel room beds.
[30:06.98]There is no number.
[30:09.60]It's just a block under here.
[30:11.28]There's nothing under here.
[30:13.07]What?
[30:14.79]I swear, I tried.
[30:15.53]There's nothing under here.
[30:19.05]Dude, there has to be a fucking number under here.
[30:20.71]Seriously.
[30:22.59]I'll look again.
[30:23.55]There's no number under here.
[30:26.03]What checkbox do you see?
[30:26.97]Is there anything under the four or five on the ceiling?
[30:31.03]Just look at the corner and the ceiling.
[30:32.67]These games are so easy.
[30:43.68]Is there a number in the ceiling?
[30:44.70]Oh my god.
[30:53.30]What's it say?
[30:53.70]Where'd he go?
[30:57.86]Where'd he go?
[31:02.40]Yeah.
[31:02.68]What does it say?
[31:04.52]I can't believe this.
[31:06.26]Yeah, there was a number.
[31:12.58]7.3?
[31:12.60]7.3?
[31:12.80]What does that mean?
[31:13.46]7.3.
[31:14.32]Okay.
[31:14.68]All right.
[31:16.82]Thank you.
[31:17.66]No, I actually really appreciate it.
[31:18.82]Thank you.
[31:20.17]That helps you somehow?
[31:22.87]Yeah.
[31:23.65]Thank you so much.
[31:24.93]You go back to whatever you're doing.
[31:25.89]You can play that stupid-ass game.
[31:28.43]I am about to solve... I'm going to get a few seconds to work.
[31:32.37]I hate you so much.
[31:34.23]Seriously, thank you.
[31:35.49]Glad I could help.
[31:36.37]But still, like, fuck you, and I'm gonna haunt your whole life, and all you grandkids and shit.
[31:42.13]My grandkids, too?
[31:43.25]Oh, my grandkids.
[31:45.59]Well, they're probably shit.
[31:47.33]Oh, man.
[31:49.13]I thought if I helped you, you wouldn't haunt me.
[31:52.05]You're always going back on your word.
[31:54.03]Is that scarier?
[31:54.81]Yeah.
[32:06.78]I don't know what I'm going to do about this.
[32:08.18]It's actually just kind of fun.
[32:09.16]I think I'm going to stay like this.
[32:11.76]Stay in?
[32:12.46]You know, they show up like every movie we've ever made.
[32:17.28]Wow.
[32:19.00]So it's fun being a ghost?
[32:21.00]It's actually pretty cool.
[32:21.72]You can get to see any movie we've ever made, any video game we've made.
[32:24.32]It's actually really awesome.
[32:25.70]I'll bet.
[32:26.16]Ghost is popular.
[32:28.12]You can keep this shit.
[32:30.66]This real world shit?
[32:32.04]It's no good?
[32:34.23]That does sound fun.
[32:34.89]Do you like watch people make out and stuff?
[32:38.76]No.
[32:39.72]I don't know why that's the first thing I thought of it.
[32:58.65]No, what?
[32:59.65]Yeah, no, I'm like that.
[33:02.19]I guess I was like, if I was a ghost, it might be one of the first things I do.
[33:08.37]Well... I'm losing power.
[33:11.82]I'm losing power.
[33:13.12]I wish you luck, but it sounds like you don't... No, no, no.
[33:16.64]Thanks for the number, but you're a lot of trouble.
[33:18.62]When I get more power, you're a lot of trouble.
[33:23.49]You took everything from me, even though it's really actually not that bad of a character.
[33:27.32]And I'm gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
[33:30.20]You better run.
[33:31.20]And you better never look back.
[33:33.64]Okay.
[33:36.14]Uh, so... No, no, no.
[33:41.92]Yeah.
