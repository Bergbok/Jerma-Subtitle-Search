[ve:61.1.100]

[01:05.33]How we doing?
[01:07.41]Good afternoon.
[01:09.59]Good to see you.
[01:15.38]We've got a lot planned for today.
[01:27.93]We're going to be doing a truck driving game as well as
[01:35.64]Dracula.
[01:38.58]Dracula 2.
[01:39.10]We're going to see the ending cutscene maybe tonight.
[01:42.91]I'm not sure.
[01:43.49]We'll see.
[01:48.72]I do want to get the ads out of the way so we can turn off the pre-rolls.
[01:51.64]You know the deal.
[01:54.90]We'll be starting in about a minute.
[02:03.83]Yeah, 18 wheels of steel.
[02:07.45]American Truck Simulator.
[02:10.81]That might not even be what the name of the game is.
[02:13.31]It's something like that though.
[02:20.64]Why not play ads first thing?
[02:22.92]That's kind of the deal.
[02:26.48]It's just, I don't even know if you can run them immediately.
[02:28.72]I don't think I can.
[02:29.32]I think you have to maybe wait a minute or two.
[02:32.93]It's been about two minutes and that's when they usually start.
[02:37.63]Yeah, we're going to do repo with the horseman tomorrow.
[02:42.94]And then maybe some more Monster Hunter.
[02:45.10]I want to play Monster Hunter.
[02:48.68]But ads are going to start here.
[02:49.80]See you in a few minutes.
[02:50.92]Starting soon.
[02:52.94]I'm pretty much good to go.
[02:53.92]I do have one last thing I'd like to do, but I'll be right back.
[02:58.94]See you guys in just a minute.
[04:49.32]It did this a couple days ago too, didn't it?
[04:52.92]Where ads are supposed to be playing, but they're just not.
[04:55.10]And then they just kind of come out of nowhere like three to five minutes after it says they're going to start.
[04:59.10]Twitch, what the fuck is going on here?
[05:12.17]How do you reach your keyboard when you're sitting on the couch?
[05:16.45]It's on my lap.
[05:19.00]uh it's gonna happen I just don't know when it's gonna cut me off here in a second and then when it does that's when I will go finish the things I want to finish for the next two minutes while people trickle in but hey any second now it's gonna happen here we go it's gonna cut me off alright very cool
[05:44.15]Alright, so I got to remember this from next time.
[05:46.57]That if it says ads are playing, it takes sometimes up to five minutes for them to turn on at the beginning of the stream.
[05:57.63]We'll plan for that next time.
[05:59.05]I'm going to see if I can just immediately get them to turn on like the second the stream turns on.
[06:04.39]I don't even know if you can.
[06:05.17]I don't know.
[06:10.90]Did it take this long last time?
[06:16.87]I feel like it started pretty much at this point now.
[06:27.97]How long did it take last time?
[06:28.82]Did it take longer?
[06:33.58]Why are there ads?
[06:36.21]Uh, I've started running ads during no content periods of the stream, uh, to get rid of the pre-rolls permanently and to make a little bit of money.
[06:45.73]Why not?
[06:47.59]Trying to have a better relationship with them so they don't annoy people during the stream.
[06:52.76]If ads are here on YouTube and Twitch or whatever, let's put them in places that are not going to be intrusive and annoying.
[06:58.42]That was my philosophy.
[07:03.77]And if everybody gets pre-rolls and you cannot turn those off, unless you run mid-rolls, that was the idea.
[07:11.68]And they should have started by now, but should I just start or are they not going to happen?
[07:22.97]I'm going to be fucking mad if they just cut me off if I just get started here.
[07:32.43]Okay, well, let's just assume that they didn't turn on.
[07:36.81]And if they do turn on, then I will pause.
[07:38.35]Alright, well, if a three-minute ad break starts, I promise I will stop what I'm doing and just let them play.
[07:50.64]Because I don't want to mess with it because I feel like if I screw with it... I'm going to talk to Twitch about this because this is annoying.
[08:01.39]Because what's going on here?
[08:03.17]I feel like it's going to blast everybody with an ad like in 10 minutes when it's not supposed to happen.
[08:10.99]Alright, here we go.
[08:12.58]Let's just play.
[08:13.00]Here we go.
[08:18.62]He wants to speak to the manager.
[08:24.43]Alright, so this is 18 Wheels of Steel.
[08:28.02]American truck driving game.
[08:30.92]I wanted to play this a while ago, but we got the opportunity now.
[08:38.44]It's not like it's you playing the ads.
[08:40.22]Well, the play ad thing said, hey, ads are starting right now.
[08:46.29]And it just didn't happen.
[08:47.59]So that's... Here they come, here they come, here they come, here they come.
[08:52.61]What the fuck?
[08:58.53]Okay, it said they were starting seven minutes ago.
[09:04.53]Okay, well, whatever.
[09:05.35]Let's just fucking deal with it.
[09:07.61]What the hell is that?
[09:10.05]Seven minutes later after starting one?
[09:22.60]What did I eat today?
[09:23.36]Well, I had some honey bunches of oats, which is really good.
[09:31.87]And then on top of the honey bunches of oats, I had some, I had a pastry.
[09:50.25]Your ads are not going to make it across the Atlantic.
[09:56.83]Send them across the Atlantic.
[10:05.82]I'm excited about today, though.
[10:06.86]Today's going to be pretty awesome.
[10:09.31]I think we got a couple of bangers lined up.
[10:10.93]And I do want to see the end of Dracula, so... Today might be a long one.
[10:16.90]We might be here for at least six to seven hours.
[10:34.83]I feel like I've been going... I said I wasn't going to do eight hour streams anymore.
[10:39.53]Well, this is a new era.
[10:40.89]This is a new era of I'm just... I'm broadcasting now.
[10:45.64]I'm no longer performing.
[10:46.80]I'm broadcasting.
[10:49.78]I can do whatever I want now.
[10:58.61]He's a broadcast artist.
[11:09.82]Here comes the rebrand.
[11:11.10]Yeah.
[11:25.47]Hey, can you play even more ads for me?
[11:29.31]No.
[11:31.07]I don't wanna.
[11:35.25]Alright, you guys get ready to rock out.
[11:37.17]Pre-roll should be off for an hour.
[11:38.39]People are coming here back in about 10 seconds.
[11:40.21]Let's go.
[11:40.67]I'm fucking ready.
[11:46.96]That should be good now.
[11:51.00]Alright.
[11:51.30]Hello.
[11:51.58]Welcome back.
[11:53.92]I apologize about that.
[11:55.40]The ads are supposed to start less than a minute or two after a stream starts.
[11:59.79]And it literally says, hey, it told me, hey, ads are starting.
[12:02.85]And I was like, okay, here they go.
[12:03.95]And then seven minutes later, they actually started.
[12:06.55]That's what the heck is going on there.
[12:08.09]Anyways, let's go.
[12:09.91]No pre-rolls for an hour.
[12:10.76]And let's fucking do it.
[12:16.15]Alright, this might be loud.
[12:17.23]I don't know how loud this game is, but I turned it down.
[12:22.37]Let's hope it's not horrible.
[12:23.75]I did already turn it down.
[12:25.75]This game is going to be impossible, by the way.
[12:27.35]This is going to be a really hard game to play.
[12:31.18]It has so many controls.
[12:32.46]I don't even know if I'm going to be able to do it, but let's go.
[12:40.04]Here it comes.
[12:46.02]I did get spoiled of the music.
[12:51.68]Alright, let's do it.
[12:53.84]Alright, there's 18 wheels of steel across America.
[12:57.62]This game came out, I think, 2003.
[13:01.44]You, I guess... But I didn't even realize this was... There's cows in here?
[13:07.43]And why are we driving erratically with animals in the vehicle?
[13:11.23]That's, uh... First of all, that's very, very not safe.
[13:15.69]I want to show you something.
[13:18.82]Uh... I went through the controls.
[13:23.46]And this is... There's way too much stuff to have to remember here.
[13:29.12]It's W, A, S, D, gear up, gear down, lights, trailer attached, attach, show, hide, map, notebook, voice commands, jukebox, cruise control, wipers, stop engine... This is going to be fucked up.
[13:43.96]I just want to make sure you understand.
[13:45.84]This is a controller game.
[13:48.62]My controller does not work in this game.
[13:50.60]I've tried.
[13:51.50]I cannot get it to recognize any controllers.
[13:53.62]The game is like 25 years old.
[13:56.14]So I'm just going to go for it.
[14:02.59]Graphics are good.
[14:03.21]Alright, here we go.
[14:05.33]New game.
[14:08.53]Name your player.
[14:09.21]Alright, it's got to be this guy, right?
[14:19.89]This is surprising a lot of avatars here.
[14:29.19]Ah, maybe this guy.
[14:30.09]What do you think?
[14:36.38]Scenario free mode or... Okay, become a millionaire.
[14:39.74]Devil of the Western Coast.
[14:43.20]Should I try to become a millionaire?
[14:45.26]Or Devil of the Western Coast?
[14:46.28]I feel like I want a gold.
[14:58.90]devil devil of the western coast alright headquarters uh apparently it's only Seattle is the only place we can go company color golden blue difficulty uh medium I'm not doing hard I don't even know how hard medium is but whatever here we go evil truck driver
[15:32.37]So I think there's an economy in the game.
[15:36.07]They need you to deliver a cargo as fast as possible from Seattle to Los Angeles.
[15:39.47]You'll have to break the limits ready for the challenge.
[15:43.66]Okay.
[15:49.50]I'm just at a red light.
[15:50.98]So I have to go to Los Angeles.
[15:53.80]Okay, how do you get to Seattle from Los Angeles?
[15:56.16]I have to turn around.
[15:56.83]Alright, we're just going to go straight down.
[16:04.75]Oh my god!
[16:05.55]Where's the car go?
[16:16.26]Jesus!
[16:23.09]How do I change the camera angle?
[16:28.11]How do I stop the car?
[16:34.97]One, okay.
[16:39.13]What are the controls?
[16:44.87]Geared, okay, it's geared down is a plus and minus up here.
[16:49.62]Peruse control, wipers, enter a start engine, turn signals, pump gas, call, what?
[17:03.09]How did I not realize that that's what I was binding?
[17:05.49]I didn't realize that that's what that was.
[17:12.67]I was sleeping through this.
[17:14.43]Screenshot.
[17:15.07]I didn't find it.
[17:15.87]Horn.
[17:16.29]Alright.
[17:17.47]Parking brake.
[17:18.12]Right control.
[17:21.58]Okay.
[17:22.14]Camera.
[17:27.24]Back to game.
[17:27.70]Alright.
[17:31.88]So I just have to drive to... Alright, I'm just driving to Los Angeles.
[17:40.62]Do I have to obey the rules of the road or does that not matter?
[17:58.12]You don't have a driver's license.
[18:00.54]What?
[18:12.87]Alright, I don't think this is gonna take that long.
[18:14.23]They told me to do it as fast as possible!
[18:33.55]The police are on your tail!
[18:35.33]What?! !
[18:43.36]I didn't do anything.
[18:44.16]Put the brake on.
[19:02.47]Oh shit, I hear it.
[19:03.13]I was driving the wrong side of the road.
[19:14.80]Okay, did I get a ticket?
[19:15.98]Alright, it was $1,000.
[19:16.42]How am I supposed to drive on the right side of the road?
[19:23.35]This game is impossible.
[19:32.57]Look at how narrow this road is.
[19:43.91]you off of that yeah that's actually kind of fucked up no that doesn't count like it shouldn't count he's playing a simulator with wasd take off your parking brake alright there's a gas station coming up here on the left
[20:18.81]What is going on in my car?
[20:20.97]What's going on?
[20:22.26]Why is my car going to explode?
[20:30.50]I don't do anything illegal.
[20:37.09]Wait, I need to go to the gas station.
[20:40.71]How much gas do I have?
[20:41.31]Oh, I got full tank.
[20:41.93]I'm fine.
[20:43.23]Alright, let's go to the highway to go to San Francisco.
[20:50.28]Speed limit is probably what, 60, 70?
[20:51.22]Wait a second.
[21:05.92]Hold on.
[21:07.94]Do I have anything?
[21:08.98]I don't have any cargo.
[21:12.25]I don't have anything on the car.
[21:19.36]Oh, cool.
[21:19.82]San Francisco bridge.
[21:33.31]Oh, that's a cop.
[21:33.81]That's a cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop.
[21:35.53]I bumped him.
[21:37.13]I bumped him.
[21:37.47]It's alright.
[21:37.89]I don't think he cared.
[22:05.99]Am I going to get pulled over for that?
[22:18.36]Oops.
[22:19.94]Oh shit, I don't want to hit the cop again.
[22:25.50]Okay.
[22:34.84]Why not?
[22:35.56]In trouble already.
[22:36.90]Just don't run a red light.
[22:46.65]As long as it's... Alright, that guy got in an accident.
[22:49.79]I'm free.
[22:52.28]That school bus just crashed into that cop.
[22:53.90]He's gonna be busy.
[22:54.48]What?
[23:05.03]How do I get to San Francisco from here?
[23:10.23]That's not good.
[23:22.46]Okay, that's only going to be a $1,000 ticket.
[23:24.58]We're fine.
[23:25.14]Oh, my God.
[23:31.07]I just hit a school bus.
[23:31.91]That's a bad...
[23:39.36]Alright, reckless driving, that's a thousand dollar ticket.
[23:42.78]Okay, whatever, that's fine.
[23:45.84]Alright, I'll be good.
[23:53.86]You can do that 28 more times.
[23:56.04]I think I only have one minute before it's over.
[24:00.70]How are you supposed to go that fast?
[24:04.16]Let me try the other... I think this is a different game mode.
[24:07.80]This game mode is way too ridiculous.
[24:12.34]There's no way you can drive from Seattle to Los Angeles in 10 minutes.
[24:19.83]I'm barely halfway there and I've been going crazy.
[24:23.65]Stopping at the traffic lights will end your game.
[24:33.35]It's over in 10 seconds.
[24:43.31]Okay.
[24:43.85]That one is... That's way too ridiculous.
[24:47.23]We'll just do Become a Millionaire.
[24:48.71]Okay.
[24:49.25]Headquarters, we'll start... Should we start in Boston?
[24:54.53]No, I'm putting it on easy.
[25:12.72]Okay.
[25:15.13]Repay the loan and earn $1,000,000.
[25:17.39]You must be faster than the other players.
[25:24.37]OK, hold on.
[25:26.01]Can I go to one of these businesses?
[25:31.41]Let me go to this bit like this FMM over here is can I do something here?
[25:37.82]There's an economy in this game.
[25:41.00]It's not just thrive in a straight line.
[25:45.11]Alright, what about this place?
[25:46.01]What is this?
[25:46.33]It's a mall.
[25:50.89]Okay.
[25:51.15]What can I do here?
[25:51.99]Can I buy something?
[26:08.87]Take some of their cargo and just go with it?
[26:14.58]Pick up cargo.
[26:16.78]Where do you get cargo?
[26:17.67]I mean, this looks like I could get cargo here.
[26:26.01]Look for a container you can hook onto.
[26:27.23]Let's see.
[26:29.66]Can I grab one of these?
[26:39.98]Yeah, there's no tutorial in this game.
[26:41.21]This is one of those games where you put the CD in and the game just starts.
[26:45.89]Loads will spawn at some businesses.
[26:48.15]Okay.
[26:49.30]Let's try this other one.
[26:50.06]There's Bushnell.
[26:56.06]Oh, that was close.
[26:57.28]It's so hard to drive a truck.
[27:09.46]Alright, I'm going to obey the rules.
[27:12.03]I'm holding break right now and it doesn't matter.
[27:23.95]What?
[27:24.21]I'm not even in the way.
[27:26.09]Turn this off.
[27:30.71]I'm not in this guy's way.
[27:31.61]What's the problem?
[27:35.81]I'm clearly of the lines.
[27:37.71]I'm clearly over the line.
[27:45.57]Shut up.
[27:46.55]Oh wait, I have a green light.
[27:47.53]Oops.
[27:48.31]Oh, I'm supposed to go left.
[27:51.77]I was in the left turning lane.
[27:56.25]Alright, is there a shipping container here?
[28:02.49]Hold on.
[28:03.31]Let me save driving.
[28:06.71]Get that right blinker on.
[28:09.49]Ease into the turn.
[28:11.15]OK, very cool, excellent.
[28:15.23]So what are these worth?
[28:17.50]Cargo.
[28:19.14]From Boston to Memphis.
[28:21.66]Boston to Chicago.
[28:24.04]Boston to Salt Lake.
[28:25.52]Boston to Indianapolis.
[28:27.97]I'll take the milk.
[28:30.19]Boston to Chicago.
[28:30.85]Let's go.
[28:45.54]Can I get a better?
[28:46.06]OK, let me get a better view.
[28:57.99]Oh my God, this is so impossible.
[29:02.24]If you do this shit in real life, you have an unbelievable amount of skill.
[29:07.64]You ever see those truck drivers that they, they're on regular roads and they just, they, it's such a tight turn.
[29:15.18]They're on a small single lane road.
[29:19.06]I just get so, I like, wow, every time I see it, I go, holy shit, that person knows what they're doing.
[29:23.26]Okay, what's the, uh, attach button?
[29:28.78]Is it a little loud?
[29:29.42]It might be a little loud.
[29:35.75]Alright, patch trailer, where is it?
[29:38.17]Okay, notebook is at N. Wipers.
[29:44.65]Left turn signal, pump gas.
[29:47.74]Change mirrors.

[30:02.11]Bumper camera.
[30:03.61]Where was the attached trailer?
[30:04.65]I just missed it.
[30:05.38]Okay, it's this button.
[30:08.10]So it's the right square bracket left square bracket right square bracket left.
[30:17.99]So, got it.
[30:20.15]Now I have to go.
[30:20.83]I'm driving now from here to Chicago.
[30:24.65]So we need to go through Pittsburgh.
[30:26.41]I'm going to take 90 west through Pittsburgh.
[30:31.38]Then I'm going to take 79 south.
[30:33.42]I'm going to stop at that gas station.
[30:36.80]65 north to Indianapolis.
[30:38.98]65 west to Chicago.
[30:41.77]So let's go 90 west.
[30:44.71]And I need to go through Pittsburgh.
[30:46.95]Okay, here we go.
[30:50.47]Ooh, this is interesting.
[30:52.13]Alright.
[30:52.49]Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[30:53.27]Alright.
[30:53.54]Wait, wait, wait.

[40:36.68]I should go through Pittsburgh.
[40:38.64]Oh, hold on.
[40:39.06]Be cool, be cool, be cool, be cool.
[40:59.02]Let's turn it up here.
[41:02.10]Wrong side of the road.
[41:03.24]That is such dog shit.
[41:04.48]I didn't go on the wrong side of the road.
[41:06.07]It's a two lane highway.
[41:09.19]Speed limit is 65.
[41:13.83]Why am I only going 50?
[41:14.51]Should I gear up?
[41:29.94]Gear up should be the plus sign.
[41:31.64]Oh, okay.
[41:31.92]Okay, I gotta slow down, slow down, slow down.
[41:43.01]Merge around.
[41:47.37]I'm getting that $4,000.
[41:47.87]We're good.
[41:57.34]Where am I going?
[41:58.42]I'm going to Chicago.
[42:13.59]Alright, I can't.

[42:44.26]I'm just staying on the road.
[42:45.28]We're going 79, stopping at that gas station through 65.
[42:49.31]Oh, now I understand why it wanted me to take 95.
[42:56.71]Can I get on 70 here?
[43:07.06]What?
[43:08.64]There's a rival trucker up ahead.
[43:10.14]How's the flow looking for us up ahead?
[43:11.50]Wait.

[43:51.19]You missed the turn?
[43:54.20]I want to go to the gas station here.
[43:55.87]Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to get a service station.
[43:59.01]I want to go to the station up here.
[44:00.31]I got a thousand bucks.
[44:12.80]Yeah, I wouldn't hit a gas station if I went that way.
[44:14.60]I would have to go up in New York.
[44:18.04]Okay.
[44:19.64]Pull over.
[44:20.08]Here we go.
[44:23.83]I'm going 60 into the gas station.
[44:25.51]Slow down, please.
[44:26.87]Hit the brake.
[44:27.33]Parking brake.
[44:27.91]Hit the brake.
[44:28.43]Brake, brake, brake, brake, brake.
[44:30.33]Okay.
[44:34.51]75 bucks to fix?
[44:36.43]25% damage?
[44:40.11]F6 to fix it?
[44:44.23]How do I fix it?
[44:46.07]F6 didn't do anything.
[44:51.58]Wait, isn't it... I rebounded, didn't I?
[44:58.77]It's like it's used service, right?
[45:00.29]Okay, F is performance service.
[45:02.65]And then P is pump gas.
[45:03.49]There we go.
[45:07.88]Alright, I'm good with 5% damage.
[45:10.48]Get a little bit of gas.
[45:13.10]227 a gallon.
[45:42.88]Full tank.
[45:44.54]Damage is under control.
[45:45.72]Alright, we're good.
[45:48.02]Now I need to go 65 north.
[45:50.44]Why is this guy sitting in the... You gotta drive, man.
[46:00.66]Lower the music, it's too loud.
[46:01.74]It actually is, you're right.
[46:15.47]How's that, better?
[46:19.37]Is that more tolerable?
[46:34.05]Go across the median and take 70 instead.
[46:36.35]Hold on.
[46:36.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:37.71]Let's take a look.
[46:38.89]I'm curious what you mean by that.
[46:41.09]Go across the median and take 70.
[46:47.15]You mean over there?
[46:48.25]I don't think I can go over there.
[47:10.78]I'm going 65 North.
[47:14.18]All trucks must enter the way station.
[47:16.86]Alright, where is it coming up here?
[47:36.43]Sorry, it's hard to break.
[47:46.65]Alright, did I do it?
[47:52.70]Wait, check past.
[47:54.88]OK, thank you.
[48:01.52]Rain coming in.
[48:04.36]Wipers activate.
[48:07.08]Nice.
[48:19.88]Alright, I gotta be... Alright, there is a cop up here.
[48:32.33]But I can do whatever I want because he's on the other side of the road, so therefore it doesn't matter.
[48:35.47]I can do anything I want and cannot cross the median.
[48:40.51]So, I could... There's no way I'm gonna... Well, maybe it'll just spawn behind me.
[48:58.56]I wanted 65 north.
[48:59.56]I can't read this pixelated sign.
[49:03.86]Okay, straight ahead.
[49:07.30]What?
[49:07.56]Are you running into me?
[49:10.19]What do you mean you're right on my back door?
[49:24.23]Where is he?
[49:31.74]They just have cops just behind me.
[49:33.50]Because I think they just know I'm going to do something wrong eventually.
[49:36.20]I don't get it.
[49:40.37]I can't do anything.
[49:41.59]I have to be so careful right now.
[49:43.01]Where is this guy?
[49:49.57]Okay.
[49:50.67]65 North, Chicago.
[49:54.33]They're surrounding me.
[50:06.52]I'm freaking out.
[50:07.18]Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

[50:38.73]How's that?
[50:41.57]Ambulance.
[50:44.45]I need 65 North.
[50:46.75]Just a straight.
[51:04.13]And then after 65, I go to stay on 65 west.
[51:07.47]And then bang a right into Chicago.

[63:08.04]I think this is where you guys all started back in the day.
[63:11.51]This is good shit.
[63:12.81]I love it.
[63:13.17]Alright.
[63:14.81]Here we go.
[63:15.19]Ads are going to play as well.
[67:05.33]How's it going?
[67:07.41]Let me correct the record real quick.
[67:11.61]I was completely and totally mistaken.
[67:14.51]The dev was not saying that they wanted to give keys to a bunch of people.
[67:20.39]They said, do you want a key?
[67:22.19]So I got that completely and totally wrong.
[67:25.92]So that was not what it was.
[67:28.00]And I'm like...
[67:31.24]Yeah, man, drop a bunch of keys.
[67:33.98]Let me just correct the record, and I'll be right back.
[68:57.90]Okay, I'm back.
[69:00.18]Yeah, so I saw, I saw in chat, chat's moving, was moving pretty fast, so I was like, oh, I saw keys.
[69:07.99]Dev wants drop key.
[69:10.97]Dev wants give key.
[69:12.49]I was like, oh, give keys?
[69:14.51]Dev give keys.
[69:15.47]That's my fault.
[69:17.39]I apologize.
[69:23.72]Let's keep going.
[69:24.88]I'm having fun with this.
[69:25.88]This is cool.
[69:31.43]Alright.
[69:32.77]Uh, so I was going to... I was trapped here.
[69:36.47]Alright.
[69:38.03]Chicago.
[69:38.59]I gotta go down to Dallas.
[69:42.89]So how do I get to Dallas from here?
[69:44.28]I can't go over the medium.
[69:49.00]Back to... Should I go back to Chicago and then down?
[69:51.16]Uh, Indianapolis.
[69:52.90]No, I don't want to go this way.
[69:53.74]I gotta go the other way.
[69:54.50]Why did I take the other path?
[69:55.64]I took, like, the evil path.
[69:58.96]The two paths.
[69:59.82]I picked the wrong one.
[70:01.80]I gotta go back to Chicago.
[70:05.05]Um, they do want to drop some keys now.
[70:08.85]They are.
[70:09.71]They do.
[70:10.19]Okay.
[70:10.95]Alright.
[70:11.35]I want to make sure I got that right.
[70:13.93]Do I have that?
[70:14.72]Have I got that?
[70:24.66]So I gotta go back to Chicago, and then we gotta take the other path that way.
[70:30.01]Right?
[70:30.23]Is that correct?
[70:34.39]Wait, I went... Why did I... I came back this way.
[70:38.55]Wait.
[70:42.63]Take 55.
[70:52.75]How do I get on 55 from here?
[70:54.45]Over here?
[70:59.24]Is this 55?
[71:02.16]That's 65.
[71:03.54]Wait.
[71:04.16]That's technically 65 west.
[71:06.62]Is that right?
[71:07.86]To Denver?
[71:09.04]Yep.
[71:09.46]That's it.
[71:10.26]Let's go.
[71:10.72]I'm good.
[71:11.20]I'm good.
[71:11.64]I'm good.
[71:11.84]Everything's fine.
[71:17.24]I hope someone gets these.
[71:18.48]Oh, God.
[71:19.12]It's West Coast Bundle for American Truck Simulator.
[71:21.40]Oh, my God.
[71:30.12]You need to repair your truck.
[71:31.08]Alright, there's a service station right here.
[71:32.40]I got three grand.
[71:33.02]I'm good.
[71:38.80]I've got my blinker on.
[71:40.38]Wait, wrong one.
[71:43.19]Why am I going so slow?
[71:44.03]What's wrong?
[71:47.07]Why am I going so slow?
[71:50.85]Alright, now I want to go to Denver, Kansas City.
[71:53.15]We're going straight.
[71:53.71]I'm going to stop at the service station.
[71:54.83]We're going to go... Yep.
[72:05.57]It takes a long time to gear up.
[72:18.63]Oh yeah, here's some keys.
[72:19.69]Okay, Salt Lake, Denver.
[72:23.77]I need... I have to go to this... Wait, I could go this way.
[72:26.03]Should I go 55?
[72:26.85]55 then down to Memphis?
[72:31.75]Or should I go straight through and then down to 29?
[72:35.86]through Kansas City.
[72:43.82]I think 55.
[72:44.20]I think I think I'm going to 29.
[72:45.68]Go through Kansas City.
[73:01.15]Service stations on the other side of the road.
[73:03.25]That's fine.
[73:14.30]Oh my God, isn't it?
[73:15.16]I didn't even see it.
[73:16.06]Need some gas.
[73:27.11]$1.36 a gallon.
[73:27.75]Oh my goodness.
[73:35.95]I feel like some people actually pump the gas like this.
[73:38.53]They do it like this.
[73:43.72]What about I need to repair?
[73:44.74]65 damage.
[74:00.02]There goes all my money.
[74:05.44]Wait, this is illegal.
[74:06.69]What if I just don't move?
[74:15.43]I feel like I'm playing Frogger right now.
[74:22.11]Okay.
[74:33.36]I'm good.
[74:39.42]Alright, back on the road.
[75:01.54]There's no timer on this one, so I got plenty of time.
[75:04.12]I don't need to rush it.
[75:05.08]I get $6000 for this.
[75:06.94]We can buy a new engine.
[75:15.91]I just did that like I was being mean.
[75:19.49]I felt like that guy was getting too close.
[75:26.16]Oh, accident.
[75:45.83]I was just breaking up the accident.
[75:48.45]Alright, we're good.
[75:48.93]Alright, let's start in first gear.
[75:56.15]I want to go.
[75:56.55]I'm going to try to go 100 miles per hour.
[75:59.70]That's the goal.
[76:12.88]Drive safe please.
[76:20.57]Should I play some of the new Euro Truck and American Truck Simulator?
[76:24.83]I feel like they would be fun.
[76:28.66]If I actually take it really seriously and maybe get a wheel?
[76:31.14]And then I would actually try to drive a car for real that you could see on screen.
[76:45.85]Why am I going so slow?
[76:53.12]What's wrong with my car?
[76:58.28]Just burn out.
[76:59.71]Wait.
[77:02.65]Excuse me?
[77:03.25]I didn't have a police officer on me.
[77:08.77]Did I just get that in the mail?
[77:12.28]What was that all about?
[77:26.40]Do I have the parking brake on?
[77:33.64]Oh shit.
[77:34.58]Alright, I want to go 35.
[77:43.90]No, I don't.
[77:44.21]I want to go 29.
[77:45.09]No, I don't.
[77:45.53]I want to go 70.
[77:45.95]Where do I want to go?
[77:46.75]29.
[77:46.77]29 through Kansas City.
[77:56.48]No, I want to.
[77:57.68]I feel like I have to take this.
[77:59.92]No, I don't.
[78:13.17]I'm getting off at 29 will go through Kansas City.
[78:23.41]Here we go.
[78:23.81]Okay, 29.
[78:24.17]No, I don't wanna go 29 north.
[78:25.87]I want 29 south.
[78:26.59]That's too tight of a turn.
[78:42.75]Half of your inputs have been illegal actions.
[78:55.71]Alright, 29 self.
[78:58.07]Now, we want to go on 70 west.
[79:03.72]If we can get there.
[79:04.36]Alright, I'm going to slow down.
[79:44.11]This guy's all over the road.
[79:47.99]So you could just drive around without cargo and wait for a special one to show up, right?
[79:54.14]Alright, 70.
[79:55.14]70 West.
[80:00.16]And then we get off at there's a little spot.
[80:02.66]Hopefully I can get off on that side road.
[80:09.19]And go South.
[80:15.47]I think that car is going to explode.
[80:20.41]I think that car is going to explode.
[80:22.31]If that car is going to explode, I need to see it.
[80:32.70]I need... I have to see this.
[80:45.30]The ambulance is coming right now.
[80:57.81]I know I'm breaking a bunch of rules, but I don't care.
[81:00.02]There are a lot of ambulances.
[81:01.34]There's three ambulances.
[81:02.60]Are they trying to get over here?
[81:03.64]Oh, shit.
[81:04.80]This is bad.
[81:05.46]Hold on.
[81:05.78]Let me get on the grass.
[81:27.07]Alright, I don't think the cars explode.
[81:35.06]Alright, 35 self.
[81:51.32]Those wipers on.
[81:54.85]And I want to put on different music.
[81:56.37]Let's go with.
[82:01.18]Distant horizons.
[82:15.89]I slow down.
[82:16.53]Don't drive crazy here.
[82:18.29]Rainy out.
[82:26.96]Can I report the weather?
[82:27.70]Put on cruise control?
[82:37.74]I just put on cruise control and I went into the other lane.
[82:40.02]35 South, let's go.
[82:56.55]Oh shit.
[82:58.53]Lightning?
[82:58.89]You have to steer with cruise control.
[83:25.64]I am very 2025 hilled right now.
[83:31.51]And for some reason, right there, cruise control just keeps your speed.
[83:37.54]It's not automatic car driving.
[83:54.98]Alright, now to stay 30, we're good.
[83:56.60]35 south Dallas, there'll be 6,000.
[84:13.12]Need to go back to 2002 pilled for this game.
[84:18.20]Well, I mean, cruise control, I think, still exists on a lot of cars.
[84:21.53]It's just...
[84:24.66]I don't know.
[84:24.92]I'm reading chat and I'm... I'm just having a good time.
[84:29.22]I'm just chilling.
[84:30.79]You guys having a good time?
[84:31.47]How are you guys feeling?
[84:32.31]You feel good?
[84:36.41]That was really cool.
[84:37.03]The devs were actually here though.
[84:50.69]Did anybody get it?
[84:53.51]I saw they were dropping a key or two.
[84:54.79]I don't know how many they dropped.
[85:02.32]I got one.
[85:03.20]A few people got it.
[85:03.88]Ooh, nice.
[85:04.16]Am I going too fast?
[85:15.02]Nah, I'm good.
[85:17.64]Left lane for Dallas.
[85:34.45]Okay, how about Thunder Wheels?
[85:40.92]This one's chill, I like it.
[85:53.86]Have I seen any good shows lately?
[85:55.01]No, I haven't really been watching much TV.
[86:08.22]I feel like I've been live a lot.
[86:09.32]I feel like I've been having fun just being live.
[86:11.98]So, I've not really... The last, like, week or so, I was live almost every day.
[86:25.09]And then I would eat, and then I would hang out for, like, an hour, and then I'd just go to bed.
[86:41.65]Alright, I need to get off here.
[86:42.79]I need to get to Dallas.
[86:45.00]There it is.
[86:45.52]It's been nice.
[86:49.00]Yeah, I'm having fun with it.
[86:55.55]It is something I'm having... I'm very much enjoying it again.
[86:59.07]Not that I wasn't enjoying it before.
[87:06.19]But it had been a couple of years.
[87:07.43]It's been like a year and a half.
[87:10.23]I think I streamed eight times in 2024 or something like that.
[87:14.40]And then like 20 times in 2023.
[87:16.24]I didn't really stream very much at all.
[87:24.82]Illegal, illegal, but I'm fine.
[87:46.13]Go this way.
[87:46.69]Alright, here we go.
[87:48.16]This is going to be big money.
[87:49.12]$6,000.
[87:52.90]I should be able to afford a new engine or something maybe.
[87:56.42]Maybe I can buy a new car.
[87:59.08]Is this just until Holly gets back?
[88:00.44]Oh, Holly is back.
[88:02.70]Yeah, Holly's been back.
[88:11.68]Okay, let's dump it.
[88:13.80]And that should be how much?
[88:19.07]53.
[88:19.09]Okay.
[88:19.29]Nice.
[88:19.57]So now what can I buy?
[88:23.35]I've only made $25,000.
[88:25.23]How did you make 30 grand?
[88:34.26]Where are you getting these contracts?
[88:46.17]I've delivered two cargo and I got $5,300.
[88:50.27]You delivered two cargo and you got $31,000.
[88:57.03]I feel like I'm getting screwed over here.
[89:01.12]What's going on with this?
[89:04.98]Pay $10,000?
[89:05.52]I don't have $10,000.
[89:06.04]Alright, let's see.
[89:10.18]Engine.
[89:15.01]Should I get the big one?
[89:18.94]25% more power.
[89:19.62]It's expensive.
[89:23.98]Yeah, let's go power.
[89:29.45]Maintenance, 40%.
[89:30.33]Okay.
[89:30.77]I got the big engine.
[89:44.37]What about tires?
[89:49.01]I got 3,500 bucks.
[89:50.45]Let's get the good tires.
[89:51.41]The really good ones.
[89:52.89]Power plus 8%.
[89:53.61]Go.
[89:53.91]And then what does the antenna do?
[90:03.67]Paint.
[90:04.25]Oh, this is paint job.
[90:07.87]Cool.
[90:15.78]Flames.
[90:18.60]Can you upgrade your brakes?
[90:19.92]Oh yeah.
[90:23.77]Wait, what?
[90:27.43]I think I just went down.
[90:28.59]Did I buy worse brakes?
[90:37.41]Why did I lose power for that?
[90:40.87]I just downgraded my brakes.
[90:49.62]Heavy?
[90:49.92]You need to put on paint?
[90:53.44]I'm definitely doing that.
[90:54.18]Yep.
[90:55.24]Okay.
[90:55.34]Alright.
[91:04.65]I'm going to save two grand.
[91:07.49]This thing is loaded now.
[91:14.82]Better tires.

[92:19.30]Fog lights.
[92:25.75]Pacific 531 antennas.
[92:27.63]I mean, sure, why not?
[92:34.59]Okay, I think I'm good.
[92:41.65]Uh, so where do I want to go from here?
[92:44.95]What comes out of Chicago or Dallas, wherever I am?
[92:51.74]Okay, Dallas has... You go to Salt Lake and that's chemicals.
[92:56.38]I feel like I don't want to do that one.
[92:58.46]What if I spill it or something?
[93:00.98]Should I do it?
[93:03.32]Alright, we're going to take... We're going to take nuclear waste to Salt Lake City.
[93:08.45]I guess.
[93:08.77]One of your wheels is really bent?
[93:23.11]I think I'm good.
[93:25.83]Alright, Salt Lake.
[93:26.99]So I need chemicals.
[93:32.59]So where do I get chemicals?
[93:33.79]Is that on the map?

[94:18.37]Light bulbs, toys, luxury goods.
[94:19.31]$8,910.
[94:19.33]We're taking the luxury goods to Los Angeles.
[94:21.53]It's 10 grand.
[94:34.31]I need gas.
[94:34.83]Is there a gas station here?
[94:35.61]Alright.
[94:43.15]I-35 to I-40, 60.
[94:43.63]I-35 to I-40.
[94:43.96]I-35... to I-40.
[94:44.50]So I gotta go I-35 north to I-40 west.
[95:08.60]I'm looking, I'm sorry, I'm looking at the map and just mapping it out.
[95:12.62]I-35 North to 40 West.
[95:16.18]Dude, can I please, please just get, this is, look at how gigantic this is to turn around.
[95:29.33]I failed the driving test in this game.
[95:33.12]Alright.

[95:34.76]Let's go.
[95:41.03]Oh my God, please.

[95:50.13]Alright, let's go.
[95:56.42]Gas station.
[95:59.36]Oh shit, OK, I need to go.
[96:00.60]I gotta hit that gas station or I'm gonna run out of gas.
[96:04.28]35 North to 40 East and then we wrap around back to 40 West.
[96:08.69]Okay, 35 north, 40 east.
[96:10.10]I gotta hit that gas station.
[96:21.11]I got a green turning light!
[96:22.49]Arrest that guy.
[96:38.05]Alright 30 was 35.
[96:41.20]I think 35 is that way.
[96:42.66]It's my favorite bit ever.
[96:53.04]Very good that I've ever done or tried to do.
[96:55.66]We're just in general ever.
[97:07.61]Alright, I can't look at the chat.
[97:09.11]I'm not gonna look at the chat while I'm doing this.
[97:23.01]This baseball's fast-forward scene?
[97:25.47]Uh, that's definitely up there.
[97:27.92]Know what?
[97:28.30]I think I'm just gonna stay... I'm gonna go thir- yeah.
[97:31.65]Okay, we're going 30.
[97:34.39]30 north.
[97:35.59]Hit that gas station and then hit 40 north and 40 west.
[97:39.17]And then just go from there.
[97:40.85]It's like the same distance, it's fine.
[97:54.27]Yeah, Spaceballs, they put the Spaceballs movie in and they fast forward the movie to see what happens because they want to crack down the rebels.
[98:04.11]So they watch the movie and fast forward the movie that they're in.
[98:07.97]It's probably the best joke of all time.
[98:22.82]It's one of those routines that you're so happy that it exists and somebody did it.
[98:27.22]You kind of go, man, I wish I did that one.
[98:35.64]It's so perfect.
[98:36.44]You just go, wow, I wish I did it.
[98:50.44]Okay, here we go.
[98:51.54]And I'll get on 40.
[99:02.42]How about morning sun?
[99:04.59]We keep hitting the Guy Fieri taking a bite out of the pizza.
[99:15.58]Dude, look at your wheels.
[99:17.72]Okay, but I'm about to service them right now.
[99:20.80]Don't crash into this, please.
[99:22.52]50% damage, what?
[99:31.15]There we go.
[99:31.75]Alright.
[99:32.55]Tires are fixed.
[99:33.23]Get some gas and get out of here.
[99:40.10]Oh, fuck you.
[99:41.12]Come on.
[99:48.29]Put on the brake.
[99:48.89]$2.41 a gallon.
[99:51.43]It was just $1.35.
[99:51.93]What?
[99:52.03]Why can't I buy the gas?
[100:02.34]Is there no gas in this?
[100:04.48]There's no gas in this.
[100:09.34]Is the gas in the other one?
[100:10.28]There's no gallons inside of this.
[100:19.01]It's empty.
[100:29.37]Are you serious?
[100:48.26]Is there no gas in this one either?
[100:50.16]Why is there a gas?
[100:53.60]What kind of gas station is this?
[100:57.51]There's no.
[101:02.99]I'm pressing F. Wait, it's P. I thought it was F.
[101:18.75]I thought it was P for pump.
[101:20.13]Wait, isn't it F?
[101:25.94]No, F is service.
[101:27.54]P is pump.
[101:28.48]It's different... It's a different binding.
[101:30.04]Okay, right.
[101:30.62]I haven't... Look.
[101:34.28]P... F is perform... I just had to hold F to do the service and now it's P. Alright.
[101:39.38]I screwed it up.
[101:39.86]That's my fault.
[101:42.66]Well, I need to repair the damage I just did to my car.
[101:52.40]This is for 10 grand, guys.
[101:53.38]I'm not messing around right now.
[101:57.70]We're good.
[101:58.12]Alright.
[101:58.80]Back on the road.
[101:59.36]Straighten it up.
[102:04.26]Didn't I just repair it?
[102:05.11]Why do I already have 7% damage done?
[102:10.13]Okay.
[102:11.45]So.
[102:13.59]I'm thinking down.
[102:16.47]Why am I driving like this?
[102:19.54]Stop.
[102:20.02]I need a better view.
[102:25.19]Uh, through Dallas down to 20 West.
[102:27.27]We're looking for 20 West.
[102:32.82]And then we'll get on... We'll get on the 10.
[102:35.74]And West.
[102:37.14]And cruise.
[102:53.75]No!
[102:57.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:58.11]Ah, I didn't see the sign.
[102:59.11]Now I'm good.
[103:05.33]20 west.
[103:17.36]Is the front of my car squished in?
[103:20.83]Did I squish the car in?
[103:27.54]That's traffic.
[103:47.72]Oh stop.
[103:52.40]It does.
[103:52.90]It's fine.
[103:53.76]The cops, the police don't even actually care if I do that.
[104:10.45]I am smushing my foot down on the brake.
[104:31.42]Trucks take a lot of time to slow down.
[104:32.96]I know.
[104:33.32]It's all good.
[104:34.76]I got it.
[104:39.94]It's just as scary in real life.
[104:42.93]That's what I'm saying.
[104:55.87]I swear to God.
[104:57.41]I was holding the brake.
[105:00.87]I swear to God.
[105:10.55]I promise.
[105:12.81]I was being so careful.
[105:14.27]I promise you.
[105:15.25]I was being so careful.
[105:17.79]I was holding.
[105:18.65]I was even pressing down S on my keyboard really hard.
[105:32.23]That bus was on fire.
[105:33.39]I didn't mean to do that.
[105:34.53]10,000.
[105:40.71]When am I going to do truck?
[105:56.62]Why am I coasting?
[105:57.86]I'm creeping forward.
[105:59.48]I shouldn't be doing this.
[106:07.98]I let's turn the tunes out.
[106:09.40]Let's cruise.
[106:10.06]20 West we're good.
[106:22.74]I wouldn't.
[106:23.24]I'm so bad at games like this.
[106:26.30]Because to me.
[106:28.96]How many times have you tried to do the while you're playing Grand Theft Auto actually follow all the rules of the road?
[106:35.93]It's quite a challenge.
[106:37.11]That's just this, but it's, that's the game.
[106:39.29]The game is, is to just fight every goofy video.
[106:43.79]Wait, 20 West.
[106:45.29]I need to, I don't want to cut this.
[106:46.35]I don't want to cut this bus off.
[106:47.05]I don't want to cut the bus off.
[107:01.06]Okay.
[107:02.90]Perusin, Los Angeles.
[107:04.26]Here we come.
[107:10.22]Go gear up.
[107:17.29]Just a straight shot here.
[107:27.24]You've been to LA.
[107:28.00]I've been to LA many times.
[107:29.42]Oh yeah.
[107:39.74]Should I stop and get some... I don't think I really need anything.
[107:42.44]No, I'm good.
[107:43.44]I got a full tank of gas.
[107:48.36]I'm going way too fast to slow down, so I have to maneuver very, very well.
[107:57.67]That's such a bad view.
[108:03.13]I've never been to Denver, no.
[108:04.21]I've wanted to go to Colorado for a while, though.
[108:16.20]What's your favorite spot in LA?
[108:20.26]Any taco shop in the whole city.
[108:29.55]LA seriously has some of the best.
[108:32.89]And it's always like a little pop-up taco place.
[108:36.61]It's the best taco you've ever had in your whole life.
[108:44.19]Alright, now we need to go 10 West.
[108:49.65]San Diego is better.
[108:51.85]I've only been to San Diego once, so I don't really didn't really get to explore the city very much.
[108:56.37]I went to one restaurant.
[108:58.36]I think it was for TwitchCon.
[108:59.56]Alright, I need to slow down because.
[109:11.77]I was reading chat.
[109:22.03]now we're just on this and we need to stay on 10 west we're going to la
[109:49.77]I think it's pulling to the left a little.
[109:52.63]It's falling to the left.
[109:59.74]It's pulling to the left.
[110:02.60]Something messed up.
[110:11.81]I think I hit somebody.
[110:16.58]Sorry, if I didn't see it in the game, then it didn't happen in the game.
[110:20.40]Right?
[110:20.72]I didn't see it.
[110:25.30]It needs to be in your peripheral.
[110:26.68]It needs to be in your view for the game to register that you did that.
[110:35.69]It's rendering everything in my vision and in the game's engine field of view.
[110:39.87]Can we make a song?
[111:02.53]Seeing a truck driver with his windshield wipers on blinkers on.
[111:11.09]I'll stop at this service station here.
[111:24.19]Just just just drive the shoulder the whole way.
[111:28.49]Yeah, but if there's a cop, I get in trouble.
[111:37.96]You want to put on the Venga voice?
[111:38.96]10 Western.
[111:44.76]That's a tight turn.
[111:45.79]Oh my God.
[111:48.83]Alright, so on the last leg of the trip here, I'll put on the Vengaboys.
[111:53.27]It's going to destroy the VOD, but whatever.
[111:55.37]And should I just say, fuck it?
[111:56.89]Who cares about getting gas?
[111:57.85]We're just going.
[111:58.34]I'm going to just hold the button down.
[112:06.70]Okay, this is going to be tough because the game does not like to be minimized or alt-tabbed.
[112:14.34]Did you look at the VOD splitting thing?
[112:16.48]I did.
[112:17.44]I didn't implement it yet, though.
[112:19.54]But that's a very good idea.
[112:20.84]It's something I'm definitely going to do.
[112:23.07]Alright, give me a sec, because this is going to... Let's hope it doesn't do it.
[112:28.09]Everybody say a prayer.
[112:29.29]If it does, I have the game saved.
[112:30.29]I'll just open it right back up.
[112:33.29]I'm just going to quit it.
[112:35.75]Yeah, I'll just quit.
[112:37.50]Because there's no way.
[112:38.42]It's so weird and messy.
[112:42.06]Okay, what's it called?
[112:50.27]Uh, the Venga boys.
[112:51.83]We like to party.
[112:53.11]The Venga bus.
[113:02.28]Okay.
[113:09.28]How loud is this?
[113:13.71]That's good.
[113:16.25]Alright, here we go.
[113:17.37]Let's get it open.
[113:19.86]And I'm not going to stop driving until the song is over.
[113:26.00]So my goal is, it's kind of like the movie Speed, but the difference is it's not about how fast you're going.
[113:32.45]You just have to hold the gas until the song is over.
[113:36.73]That's the version of the movie that I'm doing.
[113:39.59]Alright, let's get it open because it's going to be, I'm going to have to do this quickly.
[113:43.76]Okay, here we go.
[113:51.44]The VOD's gonna get destroyed by the way, but it's alright.
[114:00.59]Alright, I gotta hold W the whole time.
[114:03.79]Let's go.
[115:35.76]I got a huge bass system.
[115:59.37]I should have stopped at that gas station.
[116:00.69]This is way longer than I thought it was.
[116:28.27]It's crazy that an entire song was made over just saying that you would like to have a good time partying.
[116:37.76]That's the whole thing.
[116:39.56]It's just let's have a good time and have a party.
[116:42.74]You know what?
[116:44.58]That's the most successful music in the world.
[116:46.62]Do you want to be a successful musician?
[116:49.62]I got some tips for you.
[116:51.26]Make a song where you just exclaim how fun it is to have a party.
[116:56.17]you'll go platinum just make sure you say let's have a fucking party we're gonna party it doesn't matter what it is what the fuck what just happened
[117:27.58]What just happened?
[117:34.60]You got arrested for what?
[117:47.38]Oh, I skipped the way station.
[117:49.50]Oh my God.
[117:52.14]True.
[117:58.42]The song just ended.
[117:59.20]That was a perfect place for it to end.
[118:07.25]Oh, fuck.
[118:10.01]I'm negative $594.
[118:10.73]I gotta get to LA now.
[118:11.61]$594.
[118:11.63]Alright, I need 101 West.
[118:31.41]Oh, fuck!
[118:31.97]He's not driving!
[118:32.81]Why are they not driving their cars?
[118:36.57]That guy was stopped in the middle of the road!
[118:38.17]There was no traffic in front of him.
[118:39.31]I was assuming he was going.
[118:43.21]Dude, what are you guys doing?
[118:45.26]Drive!
[118:57.30]He was just stopped in the middle of the road.
[119:04.00]Do some donuts.
[119:06.06]Alright, I'll do some donuts in a minute.
[119:14.11]OK.
[119:15.31]Made it.
[119:16.75]I went from Boston.
[119:18.03]To LA.
[119:23.23]I made the whole cross-country trip.
[119:25.39]I did it.
[119:25.67]A lot of people thought the car was going to explode somewhere in Salt Lake City.
[119:31.17]That didn't happen.
[119:31.99]A lot of people thought I was going to drive over the median and crash into the river in Albuquerque.
[119:37.97]That did not happen.
[119:42.91]I can't stop.
[119:43.47]I can't stop.
[119:45.35]That wasn't even... I didn't do that.
[119:48.32]That person just... Wait, were they scared of me?
[119:51.44]I think that person was scared that I was just riding up on him going like 80.
[119:54.64]I think I scared the shit out of that person.
[119:58.32]Did I cause that?
[119:59.06]I got a green.
[120:18.89]Just give me my money, let's go.
[120:25.68]Nice alright.
[120:41.73]Uh.
[120:43.07]What?
[120:45.49]Why did I only get 7,000?
[120:46.29]That job was for 9,000.
[120:48.97]10 grand to go back to Dallas.
[120:54.36]14,000 to go to DC.
[120:55.96]That's across the entire country.
[120:59.44]You had, yeah, it was only 594 damage.
[121:00.70]Plus 9800.
[121:00.94]Uh, the one Dallas, that's the best one to do is the one from Dallas.
[121:13.21]After I go to Dallas, I think I'm probably going to switch to Dracula.
[121:18.22]But this has been a very, very enjoyable experience.
[121:22.38]And it's one of hundreds of older games that I have.
[121:27.14]I just need to equip them.
[121:30.66]And once I equip them into my loadout, we can do them.
[121:34.86]This has been in the loadout for at least a few weeks.
[121:45.63]This is to Dallas.
[121:46.41]Alright, I got another break I'm going to do.
[121:51.78]And after that we will play this to get to the... Let me just put the brake on.
[121:56.64]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[122:06.39]And then we can play Dracula.
[122:11.15]I'm going to try to get to the end of Dracula 2.
[122:12.99]I know there's probably about four or five hours left in the game, so...
[122:16.64]I'll strap in because tonight's going to be a long one.
[122:20.98]I'll be back.
[122:22.64]And again, ads are going to kick on here in about the next 30 seconds or so.
[122:28.63]I'll be right back.
