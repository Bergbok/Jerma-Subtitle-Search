[00:08.47]Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10.69]It's Grandpa here, and today I have some Hitman the Blood Money.
[00:16.85]And today I want to play this game because Hitman Absolution, the sequel to this, is coming out pretty soon.
[00:23.05]So I want to get and just show you my special techniques and how I take out the bad guys.
[00:29.03]So this is the vineyard level, and this is the guy we're gonna kill right here.
[00:32.81]He's right by the door.
[00:34.25]So this is a good technique.
[00:35.50]What you want to do is you pull out the mine.
[00:38.28]And who gives a shit about these people running around?
[00:41.14]You just want to drop it in... Wait, where is he?
[00:43.36]I think he's right here.
[00:44.92]Drop the landmine, take a little stroll over here, pull out the detonator, and see you later, motherfuckers!
[00:52.22]What an explosion that was!
[00:54.58]Wait, this is the guy.
[00:56.18]Oh.
[00:57.36]Well, I killed him anyway, so if you don't kill him with the blast, then just... Jesus, that was rough.
[01:04.43]Also, this game is all about stealth.
[01:06.53]You want to be really quiet, and you want to use a syringe to make sure you put the people to sleep and not kill them.
[01:12.33]Hey!
[01:13.27]What are you doing?
[01:14.07]Don't shoot it!
[01:15.17]Don't shoot it!
[01:17.51]Okay, let's try this again.
[01:19.21]Pull out the mine.
[01:20.07]Everybody runs scared.
[01:21.49]Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of my way.
[01:23.17]I don't want to deal with whoever he is.
[01:24.43]Drop the mine.
[01:24.93]Come on, come on, come on.
[01:25.75]I've never done this before.
[01:26.91]Come on!
[01:27.79]Yes!
[01:28.38]I did it!
[01:29.08]I actually did it!
[01:29.96]Okay, now I have to... I don't know what to do now.
[01:32.98]That's the first time I've ever done that.
[01:35.32]Oh, okay, pull out the machine gun.
[01:37.82]I don't know what to do.
[01:39.51]I don't have any bullets left.
[01:40.99]This is stupid.
[01:42.67]Okay, I should, um... Think here, Grandpa.
[01:44.81]Come on, think.
[01:45.69]I gotta just... Oh my God, grab a gun.
[01:48.01]Grab somebody's gun.
[01:50.34]Seriously, what the fuck is going on here?
[01:53.74]Okay, so I've come to the realization that you're not supposed to use the mine.
[01:58.28]So I'm just going to drop it at the beginning of the level so nobody sees it, I don't get in any trouble, and then... What?
[02:05.98]What?
[02:06.58]What?
[02:08.04]What?
[02:08.82]Why did that guy just pick up the mine?
[02:11.20]Hold on a second, what is this guy doing?
[02:14.16]Excuse me, you just picked up a fucking mine!
[02:18.23]So this is hands down one of the weirdest things that's ever goddamn happened to me in a video game.
[02:24.27]So this guy has the mind, can I blow him up?
[02:27.06]Can I detonate this guy in this entire goddamn room?
[02:29.62]Are you serious?
[02:33.62]You know, typically I would laugh at something like this.
[02:36.69]But that was just sad.
