[ve:60.16.100]

[00:10.80]We ain't doing an intro.
[00:12.40]No intro.
[00:16.60]I'm not late.
[00:19.68]I'm not late.
[00:20.36]This is the previews for the movie.
[00:21.96]You can go to a movie 25 minutes late and still catch the first two minutes.
[00:26.88]I haven't gone to a movie on time in fucking my whole life.
[00:29.30]Yeah, I sound a little froggy.
[00:32.14]It's because I got some schnots up there.
[00:35.06]I'll be alright, though.
[00:36.64]C3, babe.
[00:37.70]Come on.
[00:40.61]Let me make a tweet.
[00:41.21]Hold on.
[00:46.89]Well, that is not what I said.
[00:48.39]God, the lights aren't even turned on in here.
[00:56.86]That's how you know it's a fucking dire situation right now.
[01:00.20]We got like five, ten minutes.
[01:04.16]I need to write something.
[01:08.00]Something, what do I write here?
[01:09.08]Day two.
[01:10.10]Is it day two?
[01:10.70]It's day two, right?
[01:14.20]Why is the outro playing?
[01:17.81]Here, you can listen to them.
[01:18.71]They're probably talking about fucking... So there are many new things, but I brought a small video to share that with us.
[01:23.61]So, as we're going to see here, we're going to go into Sparta.
[01:27.62]I'm doing two things at once.
[01:29.76]So when we get there, there's actually a character that's waiting for us to invite us into the tour, King Leonidas.
[01:35.42]Now it looks like you've got a pretty special avatar there.
[01:38.27]Yes, so we've got a very cool set of avatars ranging from historical characters to very unique ones like this cultist.
[01:45.81]So they're part of a progression and reward system.
[01:47.94]Now it looks like we just entered a station.
[01:51.14]Tell us a little bit about what's going on here.
[01:53.60]All right.
[01:54.45]Hey, how are you?
[01:54.97]Good to see you again.
[01:55.97]What is historically after?
[01:57.45]Is this another Assassin's Creed?
[02:09.84]I love how Assassin's Creed puts history, like, into the game.
[02:13.05]Okay, so Leonidas is waiting for us at the end.
[02:15.57]I'm trying to listen.
[02:16.97]So it's the same character from the beginning of the tour.
[02:19.17]He's waiting for us.
[02:20.11]But now he's offering to us something very special.
[02:22.39]So we can take a fun quiz to test our knowledge.
[02:25.53]Uh, quiz?
[02:26.17]Yeah, so I hope you've been paying attention.
[02:30.13]But let's go for one easy question, right?
[02:32.93]I saw the Twitch tweet, by the way.
[02:35.15]First, a simple question.
[02:36.75]Shh!
[02:38.37]uh they took like that moment from yesterday that's like on the official twitch uh twitter now it was like it was not even a funny joke people probably looking at that tweet going like oh this is what the kind of streams he has oh his stream must suck
[03:06.79]It was me, like, covering up Keanu Reeves' head and, like, pointing.
[03:09.60]I was like an asshole.
[03:10.94]I was, like, obnoxious.
[03:12.76]That's not me.
[03:14.84]This is me.
[03:15.50]I'm a good guy.
[03:20.51]Well, thank you so much for joining us today and telling us a little bit about the Discovery Tour, and a huge shout-out to the team at Ubisoft Quebec for creating these two amazing features, the Story Builder and the Discovery Tour.
[03:32.25]Thank you again, Maxime.
[03:33.38]Thank you, Kerry.
[03:34.20]Also, if you're curious about the Discovery Tour, please ask your questions on the Assassin's Creed subreddit, and we'll answer as many as we can this Wednesday on a livestream at 11 a.m.
[03:44.52]Pacific time, along with the Story Builder.
[03:47.87]It's an amazing time to jump back into the world of Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
[03:52.13]Now, for those of us who are just joining the live stream, the conference is going to start really soon.
[03:57.04]But before we wrap it up and jump into the theater, we have one more amazing WoW moments compilation for you.
[04:03.20]Now, these are the best clips that we received from you, the community.
[04:06.44]So hold on to your beards, mud flaps, butts, whatever you got.
[04:11.97]Just assuming that I have like a big gamer beard.
[04:13.85]All right.
[04:19.84]That was hacking.
[04:25.94]That guy hacked.
[04:26.64]That's hacking.
[04:27.86]That person was hacking.
[04:33.01]Oh, no, no, these are like streamers?
[04:34.91]Oh, never mind.
[04:35.51]I thought it was an Ubisoft official thing.
[04:59.26]Alright, for a second I thought my webcam was fucked up.
[05:01.01]No, that's somebody else's webcam.
[05:03.01]This is why I don't use webcams.
[05:06.47]I hate webcams.
[05:09.43]This is next level reaction.
[05:10.81]Overreaction in E3.
[05:13.17]Not only am I reacting to your stream, but I'm putting my webcam on top of your webcam.
[05:37.50]I'm not going to fix it.
[05:38.20]I'm going to leave it like that.
[05:40.60]Over the next two or three hours, dude, watch what happens to my hair.
[05:44.10]You are going to see this piece of hair is going to fluff up.
[05:48.01]It's like a chia pet.
[05:49.41]It's going to go up and it's going to pop.
[05:53.77]Okay.
[05:54.23]I thought it was like the little kid playing.
[05:57.61]I was like, what?
[05:58.97]Dude, he started swinging while the thing was getting me up so he knew I was going to get up.
[06:09.42]Dude, I hope what a Vi clips is in here.
[06:11.48]That would be perfect.
[06:17.09]But that means I have to play an Ubisoft game though, which I haven't done in like fucking three years.
[06:23.84]That's pretty good.
[06:27.18]That was pretty good.
[06:28.84]I think they had to invent an ESRB rating descriptor for chicken-related acts for that last one.
[06:34.24]That was mean.
[06:35.60]I felt so bad for the chicken.
[06:37.74]I just thought it was funny.
[06:38.94]I don't know.
[06:39.60]Poor chicken, though.
[06:41.28]This has been such a great show.
[06:43.48]From the wow moments to all the creators around here, I mean, it's just been a blast.
[06:47.35]That was like a super ultra broom.
[06:49.35]That was like a street sweeper broom.
[06:50.47]What the hell was that?
[06:51.43]I want one of those shirts!
[07:02.20]And of course, we've got a lot more to come after the conference starting at about 2 PM.
[07:06.99]We're gonna have a celebrity showdown.
[07:09.09]Team T-Pain.
[07:10.53]Team Lil Yachty in Rainbow Six Siege.
[07:13.26]Why did he do that?
[07:14.18]Wait, what?
[07:14.52]He just like hurt himself.
[07:15.40]It's gonna be a good match.
[07:19.41]No, I really can't choose who I want to win.
[07:21.08]T-Pain, Lil Yachty.
[07:22.70]Both good choices.
[07:23.48]Both good choices.
[07:25.18]I'm staying away.
[07:26.58]Team neutral.
[07:27.66]Yes.
[07:28.08]Team neutral.
[07:28.60]That works.
[07:28.98]He like hit his mouth on that coffee table.
[07:31.12]That guy's not even part of this anymore.
[07:34.41]All right.
[07:34.87]Here we go.
[07:37.17]The show starts in 34 seconds.
[07:39.05]Back to Far Cry, then over to Assassin's Creed again, back around to Far Cry, second time, third time.
[07:46.03]Who we saw?
[07:46.61]Yes.
[07:46.75]Can't forget Steve.
[07:47.47]Shopping carts, sick puppies.
[07:59.74]So many good options.
[08:00.66]So many good options.
[08:02.00]Bring back Keanu.
[08:02.88]Everything.
[08:03.38]That was so pleasant.
[08:04.32]So on behalf of all of us at the pre-show, thank you so much for joining us.
[08:07.76]We're going to head into the Orpheum Theater and for everyone at Ubisoft we hope you enjoy.
[08:12.03]Ubisoft.
[08:15.01]Rated RP to M. Content may not be appropriate for anybody.
[08:20.89]Here comes an orchestra.
[08:24.45]Stone Cold glass breaks.
[08:28.70]And they do like the Stone Cold Steve Austin theme song.
[08:33.05]This is the Assassin's Creed Symphony.
[09:00.66]Do we go now or when do we go?
[09:02.22]It's dead.
[09:44.24]I'm so pissed off right now.
[09:46.16]I can imagine if I got to play along.
[10:11.06]I need a screwdriver to fix this thing.
[10:13.63]And batteries.
[10:14.15]I don't have any batteries.
[10:15.11]Just listen to the song.
[10:15.99]It's beautiful.
[11:15.14]That's not all.
[11:17.84]Captain Jack Sparrow and his whimsical group of pirates take you on a new adventure.
[11:30.77]This time in Assassin's Creed VIII, Green Flag.
[11:39.16]Instead of black flag.
[11:41.20]Orange flag.
[11:44.82]Coming next month.
[12:09.75]Wait, those people just were on stage just to go, uh, for like five seconds?
[12:28.42]Oh, no, no, okay.
[12:39.10]Thank you.
[13:01.37]I want somebody just to start leaving the mic on.
[13:03.20]Yeah, I'll take the salmon.
[13:04.72]Can I get that with crispy skin?
[13:06.64]And instead of risotto, can I get some spinach sweet?
[13:09.65]Oh, I would do that.
[13:11.83]I would do that.
[13:22.79]Why do they need these big menus?
[13:24.19]I never get that.
[13:24.85]I don't get it.
[13:49.58]I mean, it was beautiful.
[13:51.36]But why do they need the music for?
[13:53.53]You know the song, the song along with it.
[13:57.49]It's almost like they take some space in their hand.
[14:00.05]I'm not talking about the intro.
[14:04.20]I'm just talking about why when you're up on stage, why don't you have to hold it?
[14:12.12]You already know the song.
[14:21.03]worldwide tour?
[14:25.51]What you just saw was only a glimpse of the Assassin's Creed Symphony Tour starting on June 29th.
[14:30.93]Imagine an 80-piece live orchestra and choir playing the iconic themes from Assassin's Creed while you relive some of the most memorable moments from over a decade of Assassin's Creed in an immersive experience.
[14:41.94]That seems long.
[14:43.10]Check out acsymphony.com to learn more.
[14:46.35]I mean, excellent music, great performances, goosebumps.
[14:50.19]If you like those things, I think those shows are going to be for you.
[14:52.95]But of course, there's one show that we all came here to see, the Ubisoft E3 Conference.
[14:58.97]And it's just about to start here from the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles.
[15:03.39]Now the house is packed.
[15:04.27]And to give you folks at home an idea of what that feels like, can I please hear the bell?
[15:07.77]We're going to show the line outside.
[15:09.27]Look at these losers.
[15:11.51]Look at if they're still waiting to get in.
[15:17.08]Now, now, now, if you please, if you please, I'd like to do the same for the people sitting on the ground floor.
[15:24.06]And all the billions of people watching.
[15:32.82]Well, the excitement is here, folks.
[15:34.48]We hope you're feeling the same way there.
[15:36.52]From everyone at Ubisoft all around the world, please enjoy the show.
[15:42.86]That was like a... I can't do that.
[15:44.62]That was like a bang, wink.
[15:46.20]I can't do that.
[15:59.42]World premiere?
[16:00.16]Oh, is it countdown?
[16:19.83]London.
[16:21.71]Greatest city in the world.
[16:25.22]Well, used to be.
[16:27.44]Now it's a right mess.
[16:29.92]Government's fucked off.
[16:32.05]Extremists are grabbing power.
[16:34.51]Organized crime slicing up the boroughs.
[16:37.49]The war dogs are out.
[16:39.71]And freedom's a bloody joke.
[16:42.29]But this ain't their London.
[16:44.13]This is our London.
[16:46.56]And there's a new power growing.
[16:48.84]It's all of us.
[16:50.16]Together.
[16:51.52]We're building a resistance.
[16:53.66]One recruit at a time.
[16:57.92]What's my favorite operative up to this evening?
[17:00.02]And no, I never say that to the others.
[17:02.00]Scouting talent, Bagley.
[17:03.74]So gobs shut, eyes peeled, yeah?
[17:06.66]I have no eyes, and if I did, I wouldn't peel them.
[17:10.19]Fuck you, Dinglebot.
[17:11.23]Where the fuck we go?
[17:13.55]It is severe.
[17:22.09]They always do this long walking behind me segment.
[17:45.66]Just punch somebody, you know what I mean?
[17:47.84]Sure, but we need a drone expert, Raj, not a shit-kicker.
[17:51.31]File that one and wait for later.
[17:55.01]It always starts with, like, let's slowly walk down the same street.
[17:59.84]And pause.
[18:00.54]This is not what a gamer does.
[18:03.84]Gamer does, like, the fucking full sprint.
[18:05.60]Like, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint.
[18:07.40]They just take the first car they see.
[18:09.46]I ain't done nothing.
[18:11.92]Nobody even plays Hitman like this.
[18:13.36]That's how you're supposed to play that game.
[18:15.38]Jimmy Shaw.
[18:16.24]No formal engineering training, but he has several mischief charges for high-tacking Albion drones.
[18:21.04]Hold still.
[18:22.14]Fuck you, man.
[18:23.44]You've got no rights.
[18:27.34]Fucking hell.
[18:28.24]We find our drone expert and he's about to get himself nicked.
[18:30.92]I'm dead set.
[18:34.50]Get out of here.
[18:35.82]Riot drone!
[18:36.26]Stop.
[18:36.40]Keep your hand out of the way.
[18:44.10]You're the best North Westling if you don't... Oh, just ignore me.
[18:57.34]Not today.
[18:58.40]Hold.
[19:00.26]Prepare to be attacked.
[19:06.23]Oh, does this live forever?
[19:08.19]Several chase drones are converging on your position.
[19:12.30]Oh, shit.
[19:13.04]Deathbringer.
[19:27.40]Wait, die in the game?
[19:41.90]You die in real life in the game?
[19:56.28]Well, actually, that's kind of cool.
[19:57.20]If you die in the game, you die in real life in the game.
[20:04.79]Lovely evening, isn't it?
[20:06.79]I used to feed the birds here.
[20:09.00]Now they're all bloody machines.
[20:11.16]This is pretty great, actually.
[20:44.58]I hope it's the same animations for every character.
[20:50.10]That means grandma can like fucking rip people, punch people, kick them in like the face and shit like that.
[20:54.28]You know they're gonna use the same animations.
[20:56.24]Time to go.
[20:58.84]They'll be on to me.
[21:17.62]This is fucking amazing.
[21:21.19]This is the greatest thing ever.
[21:22.39]Can I just play as Grandma the whole game?
[21:39.63]Ready for some action, Naomi?
[21:40.91]Always.
[21:41.93]For this recruit, better be worth all the trouble.
[21:44.67]It's gonna suck when you pick a character and get instantly sniped and have to pick again.
[21:48.33]It's gonna cost, like, fucking credits or something.
[21:51.97]Camden Black Market, you mean?
[21:54.13]Yes.
[21:54.57]The Kellys are rumored to run all sorts of illicit goods out of the old stables, some with fingers and toes.
[21:59.28]There's an open ward.
[21:59.86]You can, like, fall off, like, the edges.
[22:01.66]You can get hit by cars and stuff.
[22:03.72]So many of my characters are gonna die in this game.
[22:08.72]I'll be in that menu screen 30% of the whole game.
[22:10.44]That means every time you fail a mission you have to use a new character or surrender.
[22:36.15]I'm never going to be able to relate to anybody in this game.
[22:45.61]Now, Naomi, we've already lost one operative, so try not to get killed, or we'll be in the red for the day.
[22:50.71]Copy that.
[22:54.49]Huh?
[23:00.30]What the hell?
[23:02.04]Is this a meme?
[23:04.00]This better be a joke, or I'm slammed.
[23:11.74]They always make it look so easy, but that shit don't work like that.
[23:15.38]You don't, like, do the Heimlich maneuver one time to somebody and you kill them.
[23:18.52]Me?
[23:18.74]What's moving me?
[23:26.43]What's going on?
[23:33.33]Oh, oh.
[23:35.51]Yeah.
[23:36.47]You ever choke somebody out?
[23:38.77]You ever get choked out before?
[23:40.72]It takes, like, fucking five minutes.
[23:44.76]You ever choke?
[23:48.16]No, no, listen.
[23:49.94]You ever been, like, fucking choked out before in, like, wrestling or, like, MMA?
[23:54.59]It's, like, a struggle, and it takes, like, fucking a full minute.
[24:16.00]No dude, it takes like three minutes.
[24:20.79]Remember when Ted DiBiase did that for his special move?
[24:24.56]Hulk Hogan would be in that move for like five straight minutes.
[24:27.04]It doesn't take like five seconds.
[24:59.18]I would've gotten hit by that car.
[25:05.72]That person's alright.
[25:22.33]Oh.
[25:27.11]Well, we showed those fucks, didn't we?
[25:29.33]We almost died out there tonight.
[25:30.95]Look, thanks for helping me, but I can handle myself.
[25:34.05]Right.
[25:34.93]You think you're better off alone.
[25:36.75]You think everyone else has given up and there's no one to trust.
[25:40.48]That's what they want you to think.
[25:42.64]And that's how they'll take us.
[25:44.34]One at a time.
[25:46.78]It doesn't have to be that way.
[25:49.16]Together, we can change things.
[25:54.93]Wait.
[25:56.43]What happened to that bloke who helped me?
[26:00.99]He didn't make it.
[26:01.77]Fuck it.
[26:04.42]Welcome to DedSec James.
[26:22.32]Yeah.
[26:23.32]Okay, so where do I go to meet the rest of the crew?
[26:26.52]You don't need to go anywhere.
[26:28.46]Look around you.
[26:29.68]Everyone has a reason to fight, and DedSec is open to anyone.
[26:33.76]Anyone?
[26:35.41]Welcome to the Resistance.
[26:39.77]So any NPC can be a playable character if you, like, convince them.
[26:48.15]So NPCs are the new press F to get in the car.
[26:55.46]Ubisoft has just changed the game here.
[26:58.91]Like, steal car in GTA and now steal person.
[27:02.79]Like, be a person.
[27:06.30]That's kinda cool.
[27:13.40]Thank you!
[27:13.70]I want more info on the fucking...
[27:18.58]Thank you.
[27:19.92]It's not like stealing.
[27:21.18]What am I doing?
[27:22.64]It's like they've become an operative.
[27:24.42]I'm Clint Hawking.
[27:25.20]I'm the creative director of Watch Dogs Legion.
[27:28.76]And for the past few years, the team and I have had the privilege to work on a game and an innovation that we are very proud of.
[27:38.71]Watch Dogs Legion is set in London, one of the greatest cities in the world.
[27:43.67]and it's had a massive influence on all of our culture for centuries.
[27:49.61]Today, with Brexit, London's at a turning point.
[27:54.40]It's hard to predict what the future holds for London, for the UK, or for the world.
[28:01.00]The history has proven time and again that where London goes, all of us go together.
[28:08.43]In our near future, London is facing her downfall.
[28:11.44]The UK has become a surveillance state, and freedom has been replaced with fear.
[28:16.94]Armed drones patrol the streets, deportation squads rip people from their homes, and granddad is using crypto to buy a new kidney on the black market.
[28:26.95]But Londoners never surrender.
[28:29.47]Their resilience and determination is an inspiration to us all, and they are the heroes of our game.
[28:38.40]All of them.
[28:39.94]In Watch Dogs Legion, your mission is to build a popular resistance to fight back against the emergence of an authoritarian regime.
[28:46.58]This means you don't just play as one hero, but many.
[28:50.22]And in Watch Dogs Legion, you can recruit and play as anyone.
[28:59.29]Oh my god.
[29:00.47]That took like a monocle off.
[29:03.23]Oh my god.
[29:05.58]It's unbelievable never before to see something like this.
[29:07.98]In our game, every Londoner is fully simulated with a persistent life and relationships and anyone from the entire population can be recruited into your team.
[29:18.79]Find them, profile them, hack into their lives, play their origin mission, and win them over to your cause.
[29:25.51]The heroes you recruit are all unique characters with different backstories and personalities, fully voiced and animated, and they are the stars of your story.
[29:36.16]Every cinematic in the game will change depending on whether you're playing a former MI5 action hero, a 70-year-old granny you saw feeding pigeons in the park, or anyone in between.
[29:46.17]However you want to play, whoever you want to be, Watch Dogs Legion lets you be that.
[29:53.36]Fighting against an authoritarian regime.
[29:56.24]They're taking us over.
[29:57.34]They're trying to get rid of us.
[29:58.51]They're killing us.
[30:00.37]Hack into the people's lives.
[30:02.51]And break their privacy.
[30:05.69]And then force them to be part of your... Hack into their lives and take them over.
[30:16.45]Play as Anyone is the innovation that transforms a story about freeing London and the world from the grip of tyranny into a game about the heroes that live in each of us.
[30:28.92]Because being a hero isn't just a job for someone else anymore.
[30:32.62]It's a job for everyone.
[30:34.60]So on behalf of the Watch Dogs Legion's team here and around the world, I hope to see you on the booth.
[30:39.79]Thank you for your time, and welcome to the Resistance.
[30:43.99]That'll be fun.
[30:44.63]It will.
[30:53.67]Had a good run there for a while.
[30:55.79]Now it's all riots, bombings, and people thrown in cages like animals.
[31:06.93]Oh, I know you can forget the killer robots everywhere.
[31:14.07]So yeah, it's all gonna be shit.
[31:19.19]It's up to us to take our city back.
[31:23.12]Thing is, you can't do it alone.
[31:25.30]We need to recruit a resistance.
[31:28.86]I know what you're thinking.
[31:29.88]Where do we start?
[31:33.16]Open your eyes and take a look around.
[31:36.42]Look here.
[31:37.36]Look at him.
[31:38.54]No, not him.
[31:39.98]Him.
[31:41.90]Former MI5.
[31:43.56]Duty never ends.
[31:46.81]He can get anywhere and erase anyone.
[31:51.97]Uh oh.
[31:53.01]Uh oh.
[31:53.31]There's like, there's a handful of different classes, I think.
[31:57.33]Because that granny was a robot expert.
[31:58.97]Uh oh.
[32:22.67]This had better be fucking good.
[32:26.83]And allow me to introduce you to the deadliest of the long.
[32:31.20]She's not old.
[32:32.40]She's experienced.
[32:37.04]Like I said, you can recruit anyone.
[32:39.96]And I mean bloody anyone.
[32:43.39]Him, her.
[32:45.85]Everyone is a secret weapon.
[32:49.79]Find them.
[32:51.21]Recruit them.
[32:53.48]Build the resistance.
[32:59.92]Let's unfuck this world.
[33:11.65]I'm gonna recruit anyone.
[33:15.65]Even me?
[33:20.71]Even animals.
[33:29.63]Grandma makes that... I mean, I know I might be biased, but... Microwave?
[33:41.90]How am I sounding in Philadelphia?
[33:50.73]Hello!
[33:52.19]My name is Rob McElhenney, and for the past 14 years, I have been making a television show called It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.
[34:00.06]Thank you.
[34:03.56]But I am here today because I love games, and I wanted to express that love in the only way that I know how, save for playing them, and that is to make a TV show about them.
[34:14.47]More importantly, the people who create those games and the people who play them.
[34:17.46]So, last year, I called the funniest people that I knew, Charlie Day, Megan Ganz, and David Hornsby, all executive producers on Sunny, and we started talking.
[34:27.72]We realized very early on that if we were going to do this, we wanted to do it right and to be as authentic as possible, because, as you all know, nobody smells bullshit like this particular community.
[34:41.00]So we did the right thing, we partnered with Ubisoft, and away we went.
[34:45.59]It has been an incredible experience working with one of the biggest and best game developers in the world to inspire us, because our show takes place in the fictional studio that created the biggest MMORPG in the world, Mythic Quest.
[35:00.37]And we meet them on the cusp of releasing their biggest expansion yet, Raven's Banquet.
[35:07.71]The show follows the team of devs as they navigate the challenges of running their game while dealing with the difficulties of modern office life.
[35:15.88]These people are truly set together, yet they grind it out day after day for the life of the game.
[35:20.92]The head of our team is my character, creative director, Ian Grimm.
[35:27.76]Like...
[35:30.39]Why are you covered in oil?
[35:31.57]I don't understand what that's for.
[35:33.50]That's part of the scheme.
[35:34.86]...driven and tirelessly dedicated to his game.
[35:37.48]And like most of the creative directors that I've met, he has an ego the size of a city bus.
[35:45.81]I'm going to get my ass kicked backstage because there are a lot of creative directors here.
[35:49.03]Joking aside, it is clear that those creative directors and the thousands of people who work on these games put everything that they can into them.
[35:56.07]They recognize that they have a tremendous opportunity and responsibility, that they must do everything in their power to ensure that the games are nothing short of the best that they can make, because that is what the community, you, deserve.
[36:10.48]I promise you that in making this show, we took the same approach.
[36:14.61]So without further ado, here is a brief look into our upcoming TV series for Apple TV+, Mythiquest, Raven's Banquet.
[36:22.31]Apple TV+.
[36:24.57]What is Apple TV+.
[36:27.61]What is Mythiquest?
[36:32.45]Some may say it's just a video game.
[36:38.31]When it first debuted, MQ was hailed as a masterpiece.
[36:43.39]Now played in 20 different countries on six continents, it's the biggest massive multiplayer role-playing game of all time.
[36:54.58]And today, they find themselves on the precipice of their first major expansion, Mythic Quest Raven's Banquet.
[37:05.51]And it all falls on the shoulders of one man, creative director, Iron Grim.
[37:11.65]When we think about cultural touchstones, we think E.T., Star Wars, Avatar.
[37:18.29]And yet our industry dwarfs the traditional entertainment business.
[37:22.94]So when we think about legends,
[37:26.05]Why not think Mythic Quest?
[37:28.81]True indeed.
[37:30.01]And when we think of visionary world-building artists, instead of just Spielberg, Lucas, and Cameron, why not think Grimm?
[37:42.62]I'm sorry, I gotta stop.
[37:47.62]What is this?
[37:49.48]It's a commercial for the game.
[37:50.70]It's a commercial for you.
[37:52.22]It's still going.
[37:52.93]Shh, shh, shh.
[37:58.00]Yeah, this is a TV show.
[37:59.60]This is not a game.
[38:02.20]I think this is a game.
[38:07.81]I know this song!
[38:27.65]You gotta play the best part when they scream where they're from.

[42:13.23]They said there's no longer Brawlhalla.
[42:29.01]Oh, snap.
[42:29.89]Look out.
[42:30.87]Baking pancakes.
[42:31.93]Making baking pancakes.
[42:33.87]Brawlhalla?
[42:34.75]Brawlhalla?
[42:36.01]No, man.
[42:36.39]Are they?
[42:36.85]Brawlhalla.
[42:38.44]Oh.
[42:39.18]Hey, welcome to Brawlhalla.
[42:41.42]This game is...
[42:48.26]Dude, I'm not... I'm not fucking around here.
[42:52.40]Wouldn't you love, like, a Smash Bros.
[42:54.39]cartoon fucking roster game?
[42:56.79]Ren, Stimpy, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ed, Edd n Eddy.
[42:59.27]I have, like, 400 characters in the game.
[43:01.83]I don't care.
[43:02.17]Oh, actually, they already exist.
[43:03.67]It's called Mugen.
[43:04.93]That's already a thing.
[43:05.83]Let's just play that.
[43:06.81]The only test of a man's worth is battle.
[43:18.11]When those rounds come screaming past your head, you're gonna learn if you're hungry enough.
[43:24.18]Hungry enough to take that victory.
[43:30.28]We're going to battle with the soldiers that we used to be.
[43:36.22]Ghosts.
[43:38.74]And you better believe that they are hungry, too.
[43:40.71]Once upon a time, some of these ghosts, they may have been your friends.
[43:46.66]And there is brotherhood.
[43:49.28]But then there is what the world needs.
[43:53.12]These ghosts, they are the past.
[43:56.08]They still serve the machine that we left behind.
[44:00.71]And right now, for the future, the world needs us.
[44:11.31]I'm honored.
[44:12.37]I'm honored to be here with you tonight.
[44:16.60]As you head into battle, what that mean, look in your eye, those bad intentions in your mind?
[44:22.94]Remember this.
[44:25.58]You are the few with the courage to make history.
[44:32.45]You have the desire to take victory.
[44:35.76]You will be on a battlefield full of ghosts.
[44:38.26]I believe you.
[44:39.04]Have that hunger.
[44:39.78]That hunger.
[44:43.63]That makes you wolves.
[45:07.10]That's what they should just name him.
[45:09.30]Ghost Recon, Constant Conflict 3.
[45:11.14]Hey, I'm John.
[45:12.50]Good to be here.
[45:13.08]This is Baby and the Dog.
[45:14.00]Dog on screen.
[45:14.98]Click Dog.
[45:16.36]Click Dog on screen.
[45:17.38]This is Dog.
[45:19.85]It's a real honor to be here with you guys today.
[45:21.99]Thank you.
[45:22.65]I love you too.
[45:24.61]This is awesome.
[45:25.77]This has been really great and exciting, and I'm really honored.
[45:28.79]Dog on screen.
[45:31.19]I'm enormously proud to be part of the development of this game.
[45:35.78]It was a pleasure to work with the Ubisoft team.
[45:38.68]You know, I've had the chance to play some pretty strong, tough men over the years.
[45:43.20]I've played a deputy fighting zombies, special... Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[45:49.32]Special forces soldier who lost everything.
[45:52.44]And now I get to play Cole D. Walker.
[45:55.50]He's a skilled former special operations soldier with his own sense of responsibility, his own moral code.
[46:01.98]He knows how things should be run.
[46:04.53]He loves his brothers, his fellow soldiers, but he is willing to do whatever it takes to complete his mission and take control of Aroah.
[46:13.05]There is no briefing.
[46:14.41]There's no backup.
[46:15.95]You will not face a group of bad guys or a criminal organization.
[46:19.67]You will face an entire army.
[46:22.42]My army.
[46:23.60]The wolves.
[46:31.60]We've got the numbers, we've got the organization, and remember, we trained alongside you.
[46:37.97]The weaponry of a fully operational special ops detachment.
[46:42.17]Trust me, there's an unparalleled arsenal of high-tech weapons in AROA.
[46:47.59]So if you think you have what it takes, strap on your boots and you get ready to take on the wolves.
[46:55.52]Take on me.
[46:57.00]See you in a row.
[46:58.22]We'll be waiting.
[47:05.41]Perfect predators.
[47:06.61]Sorry, there's a dog on the screen.
[47:11.33]Literally nothing else matters.
[47:12.33]We have the element of surprise.
[47:22.08]They have the technology.
[47:25.76]But we have the skills to even the odds.
[47:48.14]They have an army.
[47:52.05]We fight with our brothers and sisters.
[47:59.39]Fight!
[48:03.68]They are hungry.
[48:04.60]Take a bomb!
[48:06.08]We are enraged.
[48:08.44]Fight!
[48:11.12]Fight!
[48:14.19]All we do is fight!
[48:15.17]We are ghosts.
[48:22.69]Rip the head takedown and that fucking head hits the ground.
[48:25.08]You know, conflict.
[48:26.28]Ghost Recon, constant conflict.
[48:28.00]Rip his fucking head to the ground.
[48:41.16]I'm not insane.
[48:42.27]I was talking about a video game.
[48:43.99]That was a video game.
[48:46.75]We're talking about video games?
[48:50.63]Being a community developer on Ghost Recon Wildlands and Breakpoint has been an incredible journey for me so far.
[48:59.32]When we first announced the game, you were very excited.
[49:03.97]And after discussions with members of our community, I today announce that with our post-launch plan, we will be bringing back our AI teammates for our solo players.
[49:23.26]Wait, what does this mean?

[49:31.75]So I'm pleased to announce

[52:15.53]I haven't said anything.
[52:16.57]I don't know anything about this.
[52:18.37]All I know is it's just conflict.
[52:20.55]That's all I know.
[52:21.53]It's the Terminator!
[52:23.69]The Terminator!
[52:26.34]No!
[52:27.02]Why does everybody have to have the Terminator in their game?
[52:31.44]Did they ink the deal at the same time?
[52:33.64]Another Terminator.
[52:41.06]Will you survive your breakpoint?
[52:46.37]That looked a lot better in the mirror.
[52:48.13]I'll tell you.
[52:48.53]I mean, I've done that before.
[52:49.87]I know what it's like.
[52:51.27]I've done that before.
[52:58.80]Why the Terminator?
[53:08.62]There has to be some weird reason why this fucking 2 Terminator instance is here.
[53:20.62]Megan, a dauntless and daring agent.
[53:23.02]She's all in, all out, always in.
[53:25.60]She's all in.
[53:26.06]She's ready to shoot and punch.
[53:28.12]Crush her head.
[53:29.60]She's got her turrets ready to crush heads.
[53:31.28]Counter-terrorism and rescue veteran.
[53:33.26]His best offense is his defense.
[53:36.86]His best defense is his crush head.
[53:40.08]Nomad.
[53:40.80]Covert special ops team leader.
[53:43.18]A ghost on the battlefield.
[53:49.29]Cavera highly skilled defending operator lightly armed massively effective Squishing heads and like goron winter hands Fisher elite covert operative the lone wolf now hunts with a pack When chaos strikes Rally the specialists

[54:21.90]They're all elite squads in every game.
[54:23.86]Every single one of them.
[54:27.10]I want a group of people that have no fucking idea what they're doing.
[54:29.58]Pre-register now.
[54:30.96]Why do we... I don't want this anymore.
[54:32.46]I want to be like a moron that doesn't have any training, that doesn't know how to do anything.
[54:37.18]It's the most elite specialists.
[54:38.93]No, I want to be like a fucking sewing master.
[54:41.81]I don't want to be like a fucking specialist anymore.
[54:47.80]Is this the magician?
[54:52.82]We're gonna get the magician game?
[55:11.06]We danced and Sivio and his girlfriend got married.
[55:14.92]We danced and our friend Jaden Rodriguez danced for millions, bringing together generations.
[55:21.81]That's right.
[55:22.67]We danced and they set world records.
[55:26.45]Do you remember Carrie?
[55:27.79]Yep.
[55:28.28]Of course we do, because we were with her.
[55:31.64]That's right.
[55:32.74]Yes, dance is why we exist.
[55:35.82]And I know we're going to have much more of these moments because dance is a force.
[55:39.45]I was about to be in a magician game, but 700 million people use this as a workout routine.
[55:45.25]Just dance is more than just dance.
[55:48.11]Let's get out there and get ready for what's next.
[56:07.06]could have got the magician game there's so many prime examples on the stage right now the magician game

[57:13.51]Thank you.
[57:35.66]to be watching this.
[57:37.42]I feel like I need to be there.
[57:39.54]I'm embarrassed to be here.
[57:41.24]Not because this is great dancing.
[57:42.75]It is.
[57:43.53]This is a fantastic display of talented people.
[57:47.01]But I'm just kind of like... I feel like maybe if I was there...
[58:00.83]Get up and dance.
[58:01.57]Nobody else is doing that.
[58:06.32]I'm just kinda like... I guess I'm here, still.
[58:11.28]Those people are so much more talented than me.
[58:16.43]We got some hype in the chat, believe?
[58:35.66]There's an old tale about this village.
[58:38.84]Is it still going on?
[58:41.16]A samurai came to deliver justice.
[58:47.19]But darkness clouded her mind.
[58:50.39]She slaughtered every living soul.
[58:59.99]And became the spirit of death.
[59:04.41]Here comes the Terminator.
[59:06.47]Years later, we hunted the samurai in the village.
[59:11.57]We didn't believe the old tale.
[59:14.57]Not until a horror came.
[59:25.32]Spirits hunkered for our souls.
[59:57.55]Be wary Sakura is the spirit of death And she's brought a curse that will doom us all Shadows You got another one they lighten it up tonight
[60:28.00]Never mind.
[60:31.04]Oh, we got a Flatliner raid coming in.
[61:20.83]Rainbow Six.
[61:22.67]Quarantine.
[61:25.37]Three player tactical co-op.
[61:50.11]Hi, I'm Biojad, and I'm the lead game designer on the next Rainbow Six game.
[61:56.81]They're really, really... I'll tell you something about, like, 2019.
[62:01.39]It's called Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 4.
[62:03.83]They don't want to call the game anything else.
[62:06.01]I'm part of a new team in Ubisoft Montreal that set out on an exciting new mission.
[62:12.34]create a radically redesigned co-op experience, built on the foundations of one of the best shooters of this generation.
[62:23.42]What Siege is to the PvP shooter genre, we will be to PvE co-op.
[62:32.76]All right, this is interesting.
[62:37.18]This is pretty interesting stuff.
[62:37.94]Quarantine will test your tactical skills and survivability.
[62:41.33]Three-player co-op?
[62:42.91]Holding you and your operators on the razor's edge.
[62:48.15]It pulls you together as a squad facing off against an unknown and devastating parasite.
[62:57.48]You will risk everything every time you step into quarantine.
[63:05.90]Stay tuned and start prepping for your next deployment.
[63:09.42]I can't wait to show you more and have a great E3.
[63:12.72]No, that was like the coolest thing possible here today.
[63:17.27]A three-player co-op game.
[63:20.71]We just get to see the trailer.
[63:22.03]Nothing there yet.
[63:25.22]See you in like two years when that's ready to play.
[63:37.37]Come on, give me a clip of me.
[63:44.03]Give me a clip of me.
[63:46.23]There has to be one.
[63:47.13]What did I play?
[63:47.77]I played like Far Cry 5.
[63:48.71]There's not a clip of me going like, what the heck?
[63:57.31]Like, there has to be.
[63:58.13]There's at least 10,000 of those.
[64:03.19]Fucking epic!
[64:04.61]There's got to be at least a dozen of them.
[64:07.15]I've done it before.
[64:07.81]I've said it like at least five times.
[64:12.60]No, don't clip that one.
[64:14.66]As creative director at Red Storm Entertainment.
[64:18.84]I'm irrelevant.
[64:20.08]There's no greater reward for me or the team than to see our game come to life.
[64:27.28]and to see our players, our star players, taking tremendous pride in being a part of the division.
[64:36.62]Yeah!
[64:37.74]Yeah, yeah.
[64:38.70]Oh, that was loud.
[64:40.82]Now, if you haven't had the opportunity to play The Division 2 yet, we would be thrilled to have you join our very passionate community, because I'm happy to announce that this week only, between June 13th and June 16th, The Division 2 will be absolutely 100% free for everyone to play.
[65:08.92]And there's no better time to join us as we're about to release the first of our major content updates for our year one journey.
[65:16.21]Play free for three days.
[65:17.83]A journey beyond Washington DC.
[65:19.01]That shit's not even long enough to go through the tutorial.
[65:20.69]To save not just a city, but an entire nation.
[65:30.93]We got another one.
[65:51.19]Conflict.
[65:56.91]All right.
[65:57.29]All right.
[65:57.77]I want different kinds of conflict.
[65:59.13]I want, like, animal conflict.
[66:00.85]Thank you.
[66:01.97]Episode one.
[66:02.79]Like a jungle game.
[66:04.29]Right around the corner.
[66:06.00]We deliver to you new main missions and a brand new game experience.
[66:11.66]So for the first time, we're taking the fight outside the city.
[66:16.35]and you'll venture deep into the woodlands to spearhead an attack on a presidential compound as you seek to bring a traitor to justice.
[66:26.03]The National Zoo is the setting of our next mission.
[66:28.83]Zoo.
[66:29.15]Where you and your team will hunt down the surviving outcast leader.
[66:33.24]You and your team play as snakes.
[66:34.64]This brings us to our final edition of episode one, a place called Kenley College, and it's home to an entirely new gameplay experience.
[66:42.99]One that will take exploration, investigation, and logic to uncover the fate of a military convoy gone dark.
[66:51.68]Yeah, I'm getting sick of, like, backpack sprint shoot games.
[66:55.06]Coming this fall, we will bring to you the Pentagon.
[67:05.59]Once an impenetrable fortress,
[67:08.58]It has fallen to the black tusks.
[67:09.97]You got a backpack on?
[67:10.85]Secrets are about to be thrown out into the open.
[67:12.95]Are you running like this?
[67:13.87]You must do everything it takes to secure what lies behind the walls of this last castle.
[67:19.79]Yep.
[67:20.84]But this won't be the greatest danger you face in episode two.
[67:22.80]Bring me a fucking zoo game.
[67:23.84]No, I know zoo.
[67:24.70]There's like plenty of those.
[67:26.36]That our second raid will be coming this fall.
[67:29.18]Bringing back intense eight player action.
[67:31.16]Yeah.
[67:35.01]Watching you tackle the first raid was awesome, and we cannot wait to see what world records you break this time around.
[67:40.88]Caveman.
[67:41.42]They already kind of did that.
[67:42.74]This brings us to our third and final episode of Year One.
[67:48.12]What if rebirth was not about bringing the world as we know it back to life, but the opposite?
[67:57.76]One man holds that power, and humanity itself is at stake.
[68:04.19]Can you guys guess if he's a special operative?
[68:06.61]It's time to engage in a manhunt.
[68:11.30]Let's see.
[68:13.06]Let's see how skilled and talented and special operative this guy is.
[68:17.42]Poor girl.
[68:19.62]All right.
[68:23.45]All right.
[68:36.16]No, no, he's just got a backpack on and he's got a gun.
[68:38.72]He's trained.
[68:41.06]We fought to protect the weak.
[68:46.51]But training doesn't prepare you to hunt someone you used to call brother.
[68:52.91]He has left us no other choice.
[68:57.01]If we don't stop him, there will be nothing left to save.
[69:05.87]Holy shit, what about that?
[69:10.97]I can't wait for that.
[69:13.17]Okay, one last thing.
[69:15.87]As you might know, we have been working on a movie.
[69:20.25]It will be directed by David Leitch, starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal.
[69:26.58]Well, today, I'm proud to announce that we will be making the Division movie
[69:33.46]with Netflix.
[69:35.18]More to come on that in the future.
[69:37.20]Thank you very much.
[69:38.58]Thank you.
[69:39.92]Netflix.
[69:41.54]Netflix, okay, Netflix just has like a bag of rice that just has like, no, South Park already made this joke, nevermind.
[69:49.01]It was a good joke.
[69:51.33]That was a pretty good South Park joke that I was about to make.
[69:54.05]Oh my God.
[69:58.45]Wow.
[70:00.19]Hello, everyone.
[70:02.87]Uno!
[70:02.95]Uno!
[70:03.09]Except the cards all have backpacks on.
[70:04.41]And guns!
[70:04.63]It's perfect!
[70:05.23]And they shoot at each other!
[70:34.33]You'll get earliest available access to new games, including the premium editions with all their additional content.
[70:42.27]And you can enjoy the depth of our PC catalog that includes over 100 games and growing.
[70:48.40]We talked about this yesterday.
[70:49.74]It's like Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV Plus.
[70:55.57]HBO Now, it's gonna be Ubisoft Now, Microsoft Go.
[70:58.36]Square Enix, yay.
[70:59.12]It's happening.
[71:22.15]What do you think about this, right?
[71:24.51]But here's the thing.
[71:25.17]If you buy one game a month, this is where the implication comes from.
[71:31.12]If you buy like one or two games a month that are $60, you spend $120, like $60 to $120 a month, right?
[71:37.10]Well, I mean, then why don't you just pay $88 a month, every month, and get access to everything?
[71:45.77]You know, it's like, ah, it's gonna happen.
[71:52.08]Speak up.
[71:52.72]Did you not hear my point?
[71:53.90]I made a pretty good point.
[71:59.00]Yeah, you don't own the games.
[72:00.30]Yeah, you will not own those games.
[72:02.51]But there's gonna be, the next five years or so, you're gonna see, like, $15 from Microsoft a month, $15 from Ubisoft, $20 from...
[72:11.07]Square Enix, I keep making these companies up.
[72:13.09]Maybe even like companies like Nintendo, doesn't matter.
[72:16.33]Sony, like $18.99 for the PS Plus Power Pass.
[72:19.74]It's gonna be like $120 a month if you get them all.
[72:22.26]Or you can just buy the games.
[72:23.54]They're just slowly gonna make it a reality.
[72:31.38]Wherever players are, we want to provide access to our games and services.
[72:37.10]I'm pleased to announce that in 2020, Uplay Plus will be available on Stadia.
[72:43.23]Should we cue the Curb Your Enthusiasm music?
[72:51.13]Stadia is the new generation gaming platform where you can play our Stadia games from any device.
[72:56.59]A special thank you to Phil Harrison and his team.
[73:01.23]This is the beginning of our partnership.
[73:08.41]I'm not muted.
[73:10.45]I'm looking right now at my audio device.
[73:13.50]Thank you so much.
[73:14.68]Have fun playing.
[73:19.98]It's where we're going in the future.
[73:23.66]Subscription-based models.
[73:24.96]Everybody wants to have one.
[74:06.07]Skate 4.
[74:07.07]Roller champion.
[74:10.23]I have no idea what was going on there.
[74:36.57]Hello, future champions.
[74:39.27]My name is Stefan, and I'm a proud member of the Roller Champions team.
[74:48.33]All right, come on.
[74:49.13]Bring it up.
[74:51.16]From the get-go, our ambitions for this game were very clear.
[74:54.84]We wanted to create something new.
[74:57.76]We wanted to capture the intangible excitement of players preparing for the big game.
[75:03.78]The hype of team play and competition, along with the craziness of high-speed racing.
[75:10.33]So we started working on Roller Champions, a skill-based team PvP sports game that is as fun to watch as it is to play.
[75:20.89]A game in which you, the player, can create your own story as you roll up to glory.
[75:27.49]But right now I know how it looks.
[75:29.84]We showed you a trailer, and I got on stage starting my little speech.
[75:34.48]That's all well and good, but when will you ever get to play this?
[75:40.06]How about today?
[75:41.04]He said today!
[75:49.32]Okay, that was actually kind of a bad idea.
[75:50.50]Could have gotten all of my fucking purple Twitch TV shirt.
[75:52.24]Am I gonna play it now?
[75:53.22]I'm not gonna play it right now.
[75:54.24]I'm not gonna play it right now.
[76:18.54]But I can't just leave you with that.
[76:21.11]So here's a taste of what you should expect once you click that download button.
[76:25.67]I probably can't even stream it.
[76:26.45]It's probably not allowed.
[76:27.07]Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to another nail-biting game of Brawler Champions!
[76:42.96]People are streaming it right now.
[76:44.36]I don't want to go download Champion Ball.
[76:49.83]I have to go, like, sign up and shit.
[76:51.86]I don't want to do this right now.
[76:56.76]You want me to go download this game right now.
[76:58.96]And, like, why would I do this?
[77:01.76]It's probably fun, but I don't want... I'm not, no, I'm not doing it.
[77:06.89]I saw one person say no, so I'm not doing it.
[77:28.07]I mean, they're trying to tap into that Rocket League kind of... You know, whatever.
[77:35.06]It could be fun.
[77:46.01]So first, I want to say thank you to...
[77:49.06]I thought that was John Lithgow.
[77:52.35]I really did.
[77:54.41]I was like, what's John Lithgow doing here?
[77:57.03]I thought everyone was cheering because, holy shit, John Lithgow is on stage.
[78:00.00]He's probably in one of the games or something.
[78:12.78]So I believe video games have a positive impact on all of us.
[78:16.89]I got out of my, like, area I'm allowed in.
[78:20.01]At Ubisoft, our intention is to create games that will make you stronger and happier in your life.
[78:29.08]When you play Ubisoft games... Get back in the gamer queue!
[78:33.26]...spend quality time with family and friends... I just need to stretch!
[78:37.30]...new inspiring people.
[78:39.64]Learn more about yourself by doing.
[78:42.67]and gain new perspective on the world and help shape it.
[78:47.23]So to everyone who plays our games, thank you for your love.
[78:59.40]Some of those games look pretty fun.
[79:01.46]The new Watch Dogs looks actually good.
[79:03.82]Looks fun to play.
[79:04.64]You push us to always do better and go further.
[79:08.62]So now, I'm very proud to announce a new project from an exceptional team in Quebec City.
[79:15.92]Please give a warm applause to Marc-Alicis Côté, who is coming to show you a sneak peek of his game.
[79:29.25]If it's another Rayman, then that's a huge gift.
[79:33.12]Thank you.
[79:37.64]Hello, everybody.
[79:39.36]Over the last 10 years, I've had the chance to be part of an incredible team that has always pushed the limits of Assassin's Creed and shown us different periods of our past.
[79:53.05]But our imagination has always been bound to the reality of the history books.
[80:00.44]These past four years, our minds have lingered on a different aspect of our history, mythology.
[80:08.81]The stories of the ancient gods and their misadventures have existed through generations of storytellers and audiences and have transformed into tales that we still know and love today.
[80:22.86]Today, now these stories have shaped our dreams, inspiring us to build something new, something that transcends the limits that we have always set upon ourselves.
[80:37.07]Today, I am very proud to have the chance to show you a glimpse, to show you a teaser of this brand new game that we've been working on.
[80:46.70]I hope you enjoy it.
[80:48.02]Thank you, and have a great E3.
[80:49.50]The rabbit's going to pop up over the hill and be like, ah!
[80:53.34]Is this just dreams?
[80:56.00]What is this?
[81:05.23]Did the rabbit steal?
[81:06.49]When heroes need help, they turn to the gods.
[81:18.53]Is this black and white spree?
[81:34.22]No, that's the wrong studio.
[81:48.72]We didn't get very much out of that.
[81:53.29]We didn't get, that was just... That was, um... That's it?
[81:55.05]What, that was...
[82:08.54]They were just talking about how this is like the biggest thing we've like ever done is new project from a new studio and I
[82:37.17]Okie dokie.
[82:37.81]It is like the trailer from the iPad app store.
[82:40.43]And we're live again, indeed.
[82:41.69]So, once again, quick reminder, Operation Phantom Sight will be available starting tomorrow.
[82:48.49]Any Rainbow Six fans here?
[82:49.78]We're live again.
[82:51.70]Well, it never turned off.
[82:53.00]I like that.
[82:54.04]Now, we are super proud, super happy to present to you the Twitch Rivals Rainbow Six Siege Celebrity Showdown for the first time.
[83:01.32]I want to see who the celebrities are.
[83:02.36]This is one of the many Rivals events to follow this year.
[83:05.20]Turn it off.
[83:05.86]Wait, is this not allowed?
[83:07.29]Is this in the terms?
[83:11.43]Also, we have, as mentioned, eight incredible streamers.
[83:16.22]We have eight of the best streamers from all over the world.
[83:19.08]No, it's not illegal.
[83:19.80]It's allowed.
[83:20.32]It's allowed.
[83:20.82]That was alright.
[83:21.30]This E3 is kind of one of those lull years besides the Microsoft console.
[83:24.22]Watch Dogs 3 looks fun.
[83:25.87]Why am I not here?
[83:26.67]Why was I not invited?
[83:45.45]I don't play Rainbow Six Siege.
[83:49.44]It's like, hey dude, why were you not invited to the Star Wars premiere?
[83:55.80]I'm good.
[83:56.10]I'm slightly less bloated than earlier.
[83:57.60]I'm good.
[83:58.34]You brought some friends?
[83:59.55]I did bring some friends.
[84:00.77]These are all the winners over here.
[84:02.21]This is how that works.
[84:04.45]We got Yachty here.
[84:08.02]Don't watch this.
[84:08.81]Why?
[84:09.25]What's wrong with it?
[84:09.97]It's just like it's an extension of E3.
[84:10.93]Am I going to watch the Rainbow Six Siege?
[84:12.57]Turn it off.
[84:12.89]Turn it off.
[84:13.15]Whoa.
[84:13.25]No, I'm going to watch this.
[84:13.97]We're watching this.
[84:14.55]But, like, at least I'm just...
[84:33.08]Oh my god, everyone's freaking out!
[84:46.75]Why is this such a conflict?
[84:49.49]Enough with the conflict!
[84:51.89]Enough with the conflict!
[84:53.21]You guys, it's starting to get to you!
[84:55.42]Oh shit!
[85:01.78]Any response to that?
[85:02.58]Uh, you know, winning once is always great, no big deal.
[85:05.10]This is probably my first time winning anything at all ever, so, you know.
[85:08.52]But, you know, I'll take the one win over 10,000 losses.
[85:12.10]Guys, um... I'll take this as a first win.
[85:14.14]I got nothing else to do today.
[85:22.10]We have to burn four hours until the Square Enix concert.
[85:28.36]The Square Enix...
[85:30.41]fucking conference.
[85:39.11]And I'm just kind of just sitting here.
[85:42.45]Watch the stuff that I missed from the PC.
[85:46.43]Should we go pee?
[85:47.07]You want to take like a piss break?
[85:49.27]All right, I'll tell you.
[85:50.24]I got team... Who's on these teams?
[85:53.78]I didn't even see who was on the teams.
[85:57.92]Roller Champions.
[86:07.37]It's at 3 Pacific?
[86:11.76]Alright, well hold on, let me go pee.
[86:22.14]How do I turn you off?
[86:23.22]Okay, you're off.
[86:24.16]Alright, I'll be right back.
[86:26.02]I gotta pee.
[86:27.37]Why is this tiny?
[86:28.03]Alright.
[86:32.43]Go pee.
[86:33.63]We'll come back, we'll burn like a few hours somehow.
[86:38.18]If I actually download Roller Champions, 5,000 to 6,000 people are going to leave.
[86:43.96]You probably are going to leave anyways because you may have just been here for the conference.
[86:50.83]Roller Champions.
[86:52.41]That would be like a stock market crash straight into the ground.
[86:58.70]We'll see.
[86:58.94]I'll be right back.
