[00:06.97]People to the left.
[00:09.11]People to the right.
[00:10.27]People behind.
[00:11.15]Oh, dude.
[00:11.43]I got killed by a parachuting man.
[00:13.81]Wow.
[00:14.25]That guy just got destroyed.
[00:15.53]Oh, my God.
[00:16.39]There's people everywhere.
[00:17.20]I don't even know.
[00:18.36]Guy that just parachuted in.
[00:20.82]Didn't kill him.
[00:21.46]It's okay.
[00:22.28]I'm pinned down here.
[00:23.36]I'm pinned down here.
[00:25.30]What killed me?
[00:26.87]You're telling me that some motherfucker on the roof just killed me?
[00:29.82]Somebody on the roof.
[00:31.34]Except for Vibe.
[00:32.00]Yes.
[00:32.52]No, I'm dead again.
[00:33.48]He shot me again.
[00:34.76]From the same spot.
[00:35.66]He's up on the roof.
[00:36.48]He's like on the corner.
[00:37.62]He's like fucking Spider-Man.
[00:39.12]Get rid of that guy.
[00:40.74]I don't know what corner you're talking about.
[00:42.55]He's on like the roof of the building.
[00:44.21]One of the highest buildings.
[00:45.05]Spawn on me and then shoot at him.
[00:46.31]Alright, fine.
[00:46.83]Spawning on you.
[00:47.51]Shooting at Spider-Man.
[00:48.91]Confirm Spider-Man.
[00:49.89]Get him.
[00:51.61]We're never gonna hit this guy.
[00:52.69]Dude, this is the one time I spawned without a sniper rifle.
[00:55.33]And I just got...
[00:59.55]Oh, it was a long storm on that one fateful day.
[01:03.57]Did I ever tell you the story of me old bones?
[01:08.53]Do we keep going under the water?
[01:09.99]Yeah, we do.
[01:10.39]Okay.
[01:11.88]Just want to make sure.
[01:14.16]Let me tell you the story of me old bones.
[01:18.66]There was a time in a pirate's life when we didn't have such old bones.
[01:26.03]And that time... Well, you ran out of bullets, didn't you?
[01:35.91]So, are we, like, defending this... Okay.
[01:40.63]Um... The house just... I did that.
[01:44.65]Did you seriously just do that?
[01:46.31]Yeah.
[01:47.85]I spent, like, the last minute looking for, like, a spawn beacon that was placed there.
[01:51.26]Couldn't find it, so... Did you just... Honestly, I didn't even know what just happened.
[01:55.36]I felt like somebody just put a flash in my face, and I teleported to, like, in the past.
[02:04.83]How do I get a better view?
[02:06.57]I don't know.
[02:07.87]I need a better view of this.
[02:08.63]I fucking jumped out.
[02:11.47]I swear to God, dude.
[02:13.62]Why am I floating?
[02:15.68]I'm flying into the air.
[02:16.88]I'm going to heaven.
[02:19.52]I'm going to heaven.
[02:20.34]God has chosen me.
[02:24.48]Let me tell you another story.
[02:25.76]You just never tell the story.
[02:30.04]You just keep saying it.
[02:31.94]Let me tell ye an old story of me old bones.
[02:35.18]I want to hear the story!
[02:37.42]One time me old bones shot 12 people in one second.
[02:42.94]Like you just saw right there.
[02:44.30]And then me old bones were buried in a tiny little graveyard behind your old bones.
[02:56.21]Well, once again, I guess we're going to have another German video where you don't even play the game.
[02:59.99]I'm kicking ass right now.
[03:03.38]And your boat, whatever.
[03:04.80]And then he turned the corner.
[03:06.66]And he shot some more old bones.
[03:10.66]And he got another kill.
[03:13.80]And then another boat came over.
[03:15.95]And he killed all the bones as well.
[03:19.67]And blew up the fucking boat.
[03:23.81]See how I was 7 and 10?
[03:25.99]I got my only 7 kills in that 15 to like 30 seconds when I was doing the old bones thing at the end.
[03:32.12]You were doing it for, like, eight minutes.
[03:38.76]Blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.
[03:41.24]You just, like, stuffed your balls in my face.
[03:44.10]Blub, blub, blub, blub.
[03:44.92]You see what I mean?
[03:47.50]Yeah, you just did.
[03:49.25]Blub, blub, blub.
[03:50.43]Did I just drown?
[03:51.39]No, I didn't.
[03:54.79]No, I just want to go swimming!
[03:56.17]I just want to go swimming in Grandma's lake!
[03:58.45]No!
[04:00.36]Grandma's Lake, the ocean you mean.
[04:02.72]No, Grandma's Lake, she's a rich bitch.
[04:09.88]What am I supposed to be even shooting here?
[04:13.22]Please don't drive us into, like, the dish from Cable Guy.
[04:17.13]No, this is the ending scene from 007, Goldeneye.
[04:20.75]Ah, this is the ending scene from Cable Guy as well.
[04:23.43]Who's this dude with the blowtorch?
[04:27.88]Some guy, something tells me, buddy.
[04:29.94]You're not gonna hit anybody with a blowtorch.
[04:31.83]What are you doing?
[04:32.71]Stop spinning around in circles.
[04:34.67]You're seriously fucking up my screen.
[04:36.73]I'm out.
[04:37.87]See you later.
[04:39.33]Goodbye.
[04:39.63]Goodbye.
[04:44.09]Look up in the air at me.
[04:45.35]What are you doing?
[04:51.59]What are you doing?
[04:54.86]You spin around in circles, blowtorch man, like trying to clean somebody's teeth.
[04:59.06]Alright, let's go.
[05:03.84]Deploy.
[05:04.27]Alright, we're... There he is, there he is.
[05:08.55]Gotta land on the building and do the bros.
[05:10.69]I'm not even close to landing on that building.
[05:14.91]I'm, like, falling straight down.
[05:19.99]Battlefield bros.
[05:24.01]You just came out of the ground.
[05:31.63]Now that we're in a plane, I might as well tell you the story of me old bodge.
[05:39.32]It was a dark and dreary night, and me old bodge was fucking on fire.
[05:48.00]Sure, he's still alive.
[05:48.96]Yeah, sure, that makes perfect sense.
[05:53.50]I'm going.
[05:55.24]Get this guy lying on the ground right here.
[06:03.78]Why is this working?
[06:07.37]I can't even see, man.
[06:08.49]You are messing up my camera.
[06:10.29]It's trying to fix my camera.
[06:12.19]It's all messed up.
[06:12.97]My character is stuck in the I'm crawling forward animation.
[06:17.93]I fell off.
[06:21.23]Now, let me tell you a story about me old boss.
[06:23.29]Let me tell you a story about me old boss.
