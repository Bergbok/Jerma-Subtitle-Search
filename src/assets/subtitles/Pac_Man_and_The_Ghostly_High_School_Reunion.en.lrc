[00:11.83]Honest to God, can somebody please go back to my other Pac-Man video and see if it's like the same music from like 15 years ago that they used again?
[00:26.09]On that atrocity of a game that was Pac-Man The New Adventures 2, whatever it was?
[00:30.17]I think it's the same music!
[00:42.18]Who the fuck are these people?
[00:43.18]Who are these people?
[00:44.34]No.
[00:44.46]No!
[00:44.74]Why?
[00:45.24]Why did they give Pac-Man the default anime main character voice?
[00:51.03]Alright, who are all these characters?
[01:10.89]Is there an entire world of these fucking freak shows?
[01:13.45]There's an entire world of these freak show Pac-Man things.
[01:22.90]Pac-Man's, like, in school.
[01:24.44]Remember when Pac-Man went to college, guys?
[01:28.78]Do you remember that?
[01:29.54]That was my favorite Pac-Man.
[01:31.25]Pac-Man 3.
[01:32.69]University woes.
[01:34.89]Yes, Mrs. Stevenson, I would like to... My homework is gone, and...
[01:40.23]Pac-Man's like 60 years old.
[01:43.28]How is he in like high school or college or whatever the hell this is?
[01:47.18]And what the fuck is this little thing?
[01:49.96]What is that?
[01:50.54]This was... Why did they make up this whole world of alien characters for Pac-Man's high school reunion?
[02:04.35]What is this Saturday morning cartoon?
[02:08.40]Is there a new Pac-Man cartoon coming out, or is there one already out?
[02:11.80]Like, this is very fishy to me.
[02:14.24]I've never seen a new Pac-Man cartoon, but I feel like they're trying to push a cartoon here.
[02:19.73]Yeah, there is.
[02:20.35]There's a new Pac-Man cartoon.
[02:23.41]It apparently came out a few months ago, and I've never heard of it.
[02:26.93]This whole game makes more sense now.
[02:29.28]This entire game makes more sense.
[02:31.18]Let's just fucking get back to it.
[02:32.30]Let's play.
[02:34.25]I highly doubt I'm going to take one point of damage through this whole video.
[02:39.28]I'm going to... Burger.
[02:41.02]They have cheeseburgers in the game?
[02:43.70]It's the best game I've ever played.
[02:45.72]I'd like to eat it.
[02:47.98]Okay, that was harder than I should have been.
[02:50.24]Alright, so here's the thing.
[02:52.08]If I take one point of damage, then I will give Stars $100 back, okay?
[03:09.08]Alright, can we just pretend that didn't happen?
[03:12.56]I gotta send it back.
[03:14.94]Gettin' your hundred dollars back.
[03:15.86]I already, I already spent it.
[03:21.04]Oh, what?
[03:23.26]I wanna play, I wanna play the zucchini game.
[03:26.22]I wanna play the zucchini simulator.
[03:28.08]The most realistic zucchini simulation.
[03:30.62]What about this one?
[03:32.36]Come on.
[03:32.56]Oh, fuck you.
[03:32.88]What about this one?
[03:39.42]Oh, the lemon game won't work until you've collected 12 lemons!
[03:42.80]Told you.
[03:43.34]Okay.
[03:43.52]Sure.
[03:43.62]Shut up.
[03:44.00]Nope, actually I can... it's free.
[03:45.37]Okay, so let's talk about avoiding enemies in this game.
[04:07.66]As long as you just move a centimeter, they will not touch you.
[04:13.18]Let's see just how much hit detection there is in this game.
[04:20.13]Where'd he go?
[04:22.11]Where'd he go?
[04:23.47]Did he fall off and die?
[04:26.01]It's okay, ghost.
[04:27.49]I've done that.
[04:28.25]I've done that as well.
[04:30.39]Jeez!
[04:33.30]I have, like, a giant ice tongue?
[04:35.96]That sucks, that- what the hell is the point of that?
[04:38.91]That just- that just- it's much easier just clicking X on people and them dying instantly, than doing a skill shot on someone.
[04:46.95]Would you like to click on them and have them auto-lock die, or would you like to use skill shots in Pac-Man the New Adventure 2, the ghastly gibbous adventures?
[04:58.06]Hi, my name is Pac-Man.
[05:01.48]I hope that I'm in Super Smash Brothers Brawl as a new playable.
[05:08.76]Hi, my name is Mr. Pac-Man.
[05:11.93]You fucking piece of shit.
[05:12.91]I'm trying to do like a bit here.
[05:21.65]I'd like to meet your dentist.
[05:24.13]Look at this guy's like perfect teeth.
[05:27.61]Sick dentist you got.
[05:30.61]Hey Clyde, what's up?
[05:31.75]Hey Clyde, seen any new Pokemon lately?
[05:34.51]Cause I'm Ash Ketchum.
[05:36.01]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[05:38.85]I'm like freaking out that he's in school.
[05:41.41]You're doing great out there.
[05:43.47]Oh, there he is.
[05:44.23]Professor Nosehair.
[05:46.50]Hey, Professor Nosehair.
[05:47.76]How are you?
[05:48.78]Hey, Circe.
[05:49.74]Actually, I'm a little busy right now.
[05:51.68]Maybe you should get back out there.
[05:53.69]Hey, don't get, don't you scold me.
[05:55.73]You're the asshole that put, like, the lemon, the minimal lemon amount and minimal pineapple amount on the arcade machines out there.
[06:02.39]You're a tyrant and a scumbag.
[06:04.95]Good day.
[06:06.49]No, you know what?
[06:07.79]Fuck you.
[06:08.23]I'm not gonna keep it PG in Pac-Man.
[06:11.45]What's this robot?
[06:12.32]Get out of here, tin can.
[06:15.24]R2-D2 looking motherfucker.
