[00:04.05]Alright, throttle, handbrake, jump jets, grab rider.
[00:09.79]Alright, so let's go, alright?
[00:20.23]I guess so.
[00:23.32]Oh!
[00:29.70]I did not expect that to happen immediately once starting this video.
[00:33.67]What is happening?
[00:35.23]Uh, hi, everybody.
[00:36.21]My name is Jerma.
[00:37.87]Welcome to, uh, Road Redemption.
[00:40.71]It's a game where you defeat my gamers crashing- Jesus!
[00:46.54]Oh, God!
[00:47.64]Okay, hold on a minute.
[00:49.46]I need a second.
[00:50.22]I need to, like, prepare for this.
[00:51.62]Oh, I got, like, a gun?
[00:56.42]How do you shoot the gun?
[00:58.74]How do I shoot this gun at this guy?
[01:02.70]Well, I took a fucking beam in the face.
[01:06.04]I want to shoot this guy!
[01:08.20]Oh, dear God!
[01:13.72]What?
[01:15.16]What?
[01:16.82]How does... I thought... Did I not die?
[01:20.14]I must not have died from that.
[01:21.73]Okay.
[01:23.55]How do you shoot the weapon?
[01:25.45]I need to figure this out.
[01:27.54]Is it?
[01:28.38]There we go, that's how you do it.
[01:29.62]Alright, I figured it out.
[01:32.99]If I could only hit somebody with it, that would be fantastic.
[01:36.71]But apparently that's not as easy as it looks.
[01:40.35]Especially when I'm playing with a controller, which I probably shouldn't be doing.
[01:44.65]But I am.
[01:45.46]Here we go, right air, right air, right air.
[01:47.92]I'm gonna get this guy.
[01:51.79]No!
[01:52.19]Shoot him!
[01:53.07]Got him.
[01:55.23]I won.
[01:56.05]I did it.
[01:57.35]Get out of my face!
[02:05.72]Can I jump over this?
[02:08.46]I got you.
[02:09.42]I got you.
[02:10.12]Let's go for a ride.
[02:16.43]Reggie, come with me!
[02:20.91]Are we still driving?
[02:23.15]What is happening?
[02:25.05]How are we still driving?
[02:27.42]We're not on the course, isn't this... Holy...
[02:50.16]I'm just gonna cave in!
[02:51.78]I only have 25 minutes!
[02:59.04]I need to put this down for a second.
[03:07.73]Alright, let's actually try to, like, win.
[03:12.92]Rather than just, like, throw up from laughing.
[03:16.44]Which is kinda hard to do.
[03:17.73]Alright, I got this.
[03:20.31]I'm gonna actually try to win.
[03:23.69]Not instantly die.
[03:25.03]This game is hilarious, though.
[03:31.42]Without question.
[03:33.62]Get outta here!
[03:35.24]Oh, shit.
[03:37.94]I'll get him.
[03:39.12]Road rash.
[03:41.08]Road rage.
[03:43.14]Hey, what's up, buddy?
[03:44.88]You wanna get road raged?
[03:50.92]You wanna get... No, shit, I was trying to hit you.
[03:53.16]I was trying to hit this guy.
[03:55.36]And then I'm gonna hit this guy, too.
[03:57.18]Screw you, buddy.
[04:06.19]How much money have I made?
[04:08.09]I've made $150.
[04:09.81]That's good.
[04:10.43]That's a good amount of money to make for just ramming into this shit.
[04:15.03]You know, it's a good day to make $150.
[04:22.60]What the fuck was that?
[04:24.64]Did you see that?
[04:25.32]Hold on.
[04:25.86]I don't even care.
[04:26.34]I need to go watch it.
[04:27.58]No!
[04:27.82]Fuck!
[04:30.00]I wanted to go see the guy riding the car.
[04:32.06]Please tell me I can get back up.
[04:34.42]I need to get back up there.
[04:35.38]Come on!
[04:37.20]Punch it!
[04:38.86]Punch it!
[04:40.04]There we go.
[04:41.72]That's what I'm talking about.
[04:43.76]Alright, there's no way I'm gonna find that guy again.
[04:46.30]So I might as well just turn.
[04:48.98]Don't... Okay, that was very loud.
[04:52.34]Apparently.
[04:53.41]I can drive up here, huh?
[04:55.93]Can I really drive up here?
[04:59.19]Okay, I guess so.
[05:02.51]Um... Alright.
[05:05.41]We're going down the mountain!
[05:06.77]There's all the crash sounds.
[05:11.41]Am I even driving the right way?
[05:13.70]See!
[05:14.00]There it was again!
[05:14.56]There it was again!
[05:16.00]Somebody is riding a car.
[05:19.28]I need to figure out how to do that.
[05:21.60]That's really important.
[05:23.88]If I can figure out how to do that.
[05:28.40]Um... Okay, can I drive?
[05:36.49]Holy shit!
[05:44.15]Nitro!
[05:44.99]Whoa, the nitro is kinda crazy!
[05:53.20]Nitro again!
[05:55.00]Nitro!
[05:58.50]It's okay, I'm still alive!
[06:01.06]I can still do this!
[06:03.14]Let's go, you son of a bitches!
[06:07.84]Total carnage.
[06:10.86]Oh, boy.
[06:12.98]Did you see how much stuff just got crashed?
[06:15.34]Did you see?
[06:18.94]Oh, my God.
[06:23.19]No, seriously.
[06:25.71]This is like tactical intervention.
[06:29.05]I'm having more flashbacks.
[06:31.37]I'm just kidding.
[06:33.89]Drive.
[06:34.59]Drive.
[06:37.10]So I have to attract co-ops?
[06:39.00]I already have like a dozen co-ops.
[06:45.37]Oh.
