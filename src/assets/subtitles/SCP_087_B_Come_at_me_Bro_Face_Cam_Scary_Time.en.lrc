[00:06.96]Hey, what's going on, guys?
[00:09.84]Jermuck here.
[00:10.48]Mmm!
[00:12.36]With some SCP-087-B.
[00:15.22]Kind of a mouthful, I know.
[00:16.90]But this is kind of an offshoot or a spin-off of the first SCP game I played a couple weeks ago.
[00:24.04]And it was heavily, heavily requested.
[00:25.64]A lot of you guys, when you saw that I did 087, you said...
[00:29.51]Do 087B.
[00:31.07]It's much more scary, much more ridiculous.
[00:33.87]So I said, okay.
[00:34.67]I also did Containment Breach.
[00:36.29]So, I think this wraps up all the SCP games.
[00:39.37]Maybe I'll play them again, but I think, uh, this should wrap it up in regards to SCP games.
[00:44.31]I might be totally wrong.
[00:45.51]If there are more, let me know.
[00:46.56]I will absolutely play them.
[00:48.34]But let's, uh, let's get this going here.
[00:52.74]SCP 087B.
[00:55.52]Sort of along the lines of the first one where it was a staircase simulator.
[01:01.44]But this one has hallways too, I guess.
[01:03.64]And brick hallways that were created by the Romans.
[01:07.68]That's not true.
[01:09.40]But this is trying to find ways to make myself happy right now because I'm about to be very scared.
[01:16.89]Floor two.
[01:19.73]Okay.
[01:21.84]What the hell was that?
[01:23.26]Already?
[01:23.64]Are you serious?
[01:24.38]No way.
[01:25.50]Already there's going to be something like that?
[01:29.20]There were eyes just peering at me.
[01:30.52]I don't even want to go down here.
[01:34.92]There were two eyes just looking right at me.
[01:42.54]I don't want to go down this hallway.
[01:43.78]Okay.
[01:49.65]Whatever.
[01:49.97]He's not there anymore.
[01:51.39]He went to go eat breakfast.
[01:54.09]Floor 3.
[01:54.35]Oh, if they're already gonna throw stuff like that at me... What?
[02:04.00]Oh, okay, wait, hold on.
[02:05.12]Is this like a maze or something?
[02:06.84]I can't even see.
[02:08.38]No, okay.
[02:14.00]I know... Stop doing that!
[02:19.40]Every time I see, though, that, like, pair of eyes.
[02:21.46]Floor five.
[02:42.63]Roger that.
[02:46.68]Six.
[02:49.25]Damn.
[02:51.29]I wonder how many octaves I can make.
[03:01.65]What?
[03:02.07]What?
[03:02.27]What?
[03:02.41]What?
[03:02.87]What?

[03:15.09]What?
[03:16.25]What is that?
[03:18.63]Why is there, like, a peephole right here?
[03:22.47]I don't understand.
[03:25.54]Maybe the guy was, like, peeping on me or something.
[03:27.26]That's weird.
[03:28.90]It's very weird.
[03:30.98]Very weird indeed.
[03:34.78]Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[03:40.80]Um... That was a fail.
[03:43.30]Um... Should I turn around?
[03:45.78]I don't know if I should turn around.
[03:48.97]he's gonna come get me maybe this is what this is for to like see him coming to get you I can't even turn around you have to face your fears right is he like coming I wish I could like peer through and see please don't kill me mister
[04:18.45]I just want to be your friend.
[04:19.53]I just want to be your friend.
[04:23.05]I think he's gone.
[04:25.73]I think I escaped that dude.
[04:36.43]He like spit on me or something.
[04:37.94]I got like an acid brain.
[04:40.50]I was like... That's going to happen again and I'm not going to escape next time.
[04:51.06]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:53.22]Hello?
[04:54.08]Hi?
[05:05.09]There's another one.
[05:05.57]Okay, last time there was one of these.
[05:07.29]Like, peeping little holes.
[05:08.39]That dude showed up.
[05:10.59]Let's see if it happens again.
[05:11.59]There he is!
[05:15.86]There he is!
[05:16.70]Where is he?
[05:17.12]Where is he?
[05:17.66]Where is he?
[05:20.61]Oh my god!
[05:38.06]Still alive.
[05:44.77]I don't know how much longer I can do this for.
[05:47.11]Okay.
