[ve:60.16.100]

[00:08.45]Um, yeah, I have one.
[00:10.69]Oh!
[00:12.09]Did you just die?
[00:12.83]No.
[00:17.13]What just happened?
[00:19.30]Did you just fall off the bridge?
[00:23.06]Seriously?
[00:23.82]I fell through one of the halls in the damn bridge.
[00:26.88]Oh, my God.
[00:30.18]Oh.
[00:31.74]I had the goddamn...
[00:35.77]Were you recording?
[00:36.85]Yeah.
[00:39.07]I say we just give you all the stuff back.
[00:41.83]I had the enchanted bits all gone down there, man.
[00:46.91]Oh, jeez.
[00:49.70]I don't think I took a backup of this map since the last time.
[00:54.14]Okay, I guess that's all we need, hopefully.
[01:00.24]There's a creeper out here, though.
[01:01.36]Alright, we'll take care of him.
[01:04.02]We got three doors.
[01:05.50]We got two creepers, actually.
[01:07.16]That's the way to the creepers.
[01:09.12]Alright, so let's go out the back door.
[01:10.48]Alright, I don't see anything.
[01:14.75]Oh, I'll be right back.
[01:15.49]Run, run.
[01:16.15]Alright, we're good.
[01:17.71]We're good.
[01:19.27]Okay, okay.
[01:20.03]We're good.
[01:21.03]We're good.
[01:21.83]Got that one.
[01:22.55]Got that one.
[01:23.01]We didn't shut the door, though.
[01:23.97]Alright, we'll shut the door after we kill this bastard.
[01:26.33]Are you going to blow up, or are you doing it?
[01:30.46]I'm pushing him back.
[01:31.26]I'm doing like the sprint attack.
[01:32.58]He's like, he's chilling on top of the tree now.
[01:34.69]He's like, he's like, I'm pretty cool up here.
[01:36.77]I'm pretty cool.
[01:37.09]Is he like a tree frog?
[01:37.97]What is he doing?
[01:39.87]I think with the, with 1.2, it's like they're more scared to jump down.
[01:45.88]They really are.
[01:47.16]Hold on, I'm going to try and, wow, he really isn't coming down.
[01:52.02]Oh, there he goes.
[01:52.96]Watch out.
[01:54.35]There we go.
[01:55.17]Got a nice little crit hit on him.
[01:57.27]Close that door.
[01:58.93]Close the door.
[02:00.15]And onwards we go.
[02:03.31]For those of you that don't know, I just ruined everything, essentially.
[02:09.49]I broke a bunch of stuff because I fell in the lava with the enchanted bow and pretty much I'm just a terrible person.
[02:15.91]So that's that story.
[02:19.63]Hold shift from now on.
[02:20.99]That's what we gotta do.
[02:21.70]We just gotta cross the bridge.
[02:24.32]I totally forgot about that.
[02:26.48]While holding shift.
[02:27.54]If you hold shift, then you won't fall through.
[02:29.34]And also, for those of you wondering, Lepter is away on vacation.
[02:36.68]So we had to continue on briefly without him.
[02:40.26]Yep.
[02:41.68]And he should be back pretty soon.
[02:46.23]Man, the one block wide stuff's really scary.
[02:49.87]Yeah, I couldn't believe I fell through that.
[02:53.25]I couldn't believe it.
[02:55.24]I don't know how to really destroy spider webs.
[02:57.90]Maybe a pickaxe is faster.
[03:00.94]They seem like they take a long time to break.
[03:03.40]Sword.
[03:04.51]Sword?
[03:04.93]Okay.
[03:06.21]You, sir, win.
[03:10.15]Alright, I guess... Whoa.
[03:13.11]There are some traps apparently laid.
[03:15.94]And we've got a mob spawner right here.
[03:19.04]So all I have to do is destroy it with the wooden pick before it spawns any pesky spiders.
[03:25.23]And there's a chest in here too.
[03:27.41]You shouldn't attempt this if you are not yet ready.
[03:29.69]I have a feeling it's going to explode.
[03:31.71]That's what I feel.
[03:33.47]So I should open it then.
[03:34.55]Look down here.
[03:35.26]Look down here.
[03:35.76]Oh, wow.
[03:41.04]Frozen waterfall.
[03:42.70]That's pretty crazy.
[03:44.26]You want me to open this?
[03:46.04]Here's what we should do.
[03:47.14]If one of us needs to stand way back here, where it's safe, as far back as possible.
[03:52.86]I have the most stuff, so go ahead and open it.
[03:54.84]If it starts hissing, run for your life.
[03:56.86]Okay, here we go.
[03:58.14]Oh my god, there's a lot of stuff in here.
[04:00.24]Is it hissing?
[04:01.32]No.
[04:02.34]I'm scared.
[04:03.23]There's a ton of leather.
[04:04.73]How do I take things really fast?
[04:05.79]There we go.
[04:08.45]Something's going to explode.
[04:09.59]I got everything out of the chest.
[04:12.37]I'm stuck.
[04:14.83]What's going on?
[04:15.45]You're stuck in the spider web.
[04:20.32]You shouldn't attempt this.
[04:23.04]Maybe they mean the drop down here.
[04:26.24]I got a bunch of leather.
[04:28.32]Let's go back over here where it's kind of safe and craft that leather into armor for you real quick.
[04:34.00]Make sure I don't waste it this time.
[04:36.26]I want to say the raw fish is just like one.
[04:38.58]So I think I'm going to go ahead and eat one of those.
[04:41.56]We got company.
[04:42.20]There's a skeleton coming down here right now.
[04:46.23]Well, with the update, they're going to stay in the shadow.
[04:49.15]So they're not going to follow you too far while the sun is shining bright in the sky.
[04:53.98]There's another one up there.
[04:55.30]I'll get him.
[04:55.70]I'll get this rat bastard.
[04:58.52]So do you want to go up?
[04:59.46]Oh, wow!
[05:00.22]Watch out behind you!
[05:00.92]Oh no!
[05:05.20]Well, they just poured out.
[05:06.24]It's alright, we're good.
[05:09.35]Oh, there's like a bunch of spawners in here.
[05:11.75]Do we want to do this first or do we want to do the waterfall thing first down there?
[05:15.35]I guess we're already in here.
[05:17.40]Might as well destroy the spawner.
[05:18.86]Okay.
[05:20.91]Oh, watch out.
[05:21.37]Hit that guy.
[05:22.23]Yeah.
[05:23.25]Leave him alone.
[05:23.89]He's my friend.
[05:25.42]Yeah, one of us has to, like, distract while the other one, like, destroys.
[05:29.76]And if you want to destroy one, it's with your pickaxe.
[05:32.08]I don't have a pickaxe.
[05:33.52]Oh, yeah.
[05:33.97]Whoa.
[05:35.09]Yeah, hit that guy.
[05:36.15]Hit that guy.
[05:37.35]Yeah.
[05:37.81]Oh, I'm getting close to being dead.
[05:39.91]Close.
[05:40.37]Okay.
[05:42.21]How's your hunger doing?
[05:44.02]I got 70%.
[05:45.42]Alright, here, take this breath.
[05:48.45]And once your hunger's full, you'll start healing automatically.
[05:52.13]A bunch of coal, a bunch of arrows in this chest, bones.
[05:57.49]Do you still have a bow?
[05:59.04]I do.
[06:01.18]So I guess you took the arrows already?
[06:02.52]Yep.
[06:04.86]What we should do is, like, all these bones are gonna be really valuable, so I'm thinking... Just put them in a chest?
[06:10.50]Yeah, like, make a chest over here.
[06:11.72]Uh, do you still have the, is the crafting table down here?
[06:14.24]It's still down there.
[06:15.83]It's down there.
[06:16.25]Also, um, never mind.
[06:18.33]We got this heal pad out here, so if we start running out of food, we can, like, retreat and, like, heal up.
[06:24.05]Alright.
[06:24.69]Nice, nice.
[06:26.91]Hey, you want me to throw these bones down to you?
[06:30.53]Oh, sure.
[06:32.34]Where should I?
[06:33.60]Creeper behind you.
[06:34.38]Creeper coming up behind you.
[06:36.62]Where did they just fall?
[06:38.10]I just threw it down then.
[06:40.03]I think I see him down here.
[06:43.27]Gotta watch out for this guy though.
[06:44.83]Can I shoot him with the arrow?
[06:46.27]We got a zombie here too.
[06:48.19]Don't waste the arrows unless you have to.
[06:49.71]He's in the water.
[06:51.31]Now he's up.
[06:52.53]They're crafty.
[06:53.37]They're cunning.
[06:55.07]Watch yourself.
[06:56.07]Okay, I'm safe.
[06:57.79]Nothing even took damage.
[06:58.57]I'm gonna throw all the bones down at you.
[07:00.69]There's a zombie coming for one of us.
[07:04.01]And now a thunderstorm.
[07:05.73]What was that?
[07:06.87]It was like, it was just thunder.
[07:09.03]Oh, oh.
[07:10.61]I gotta turn my volume down again.
[07:13.13]Get that, son of a B. Right, what does it mean when there's just a thing of fire just sitting here burning on obsidian?
[07:21.50]we at this is um this looks uh I think that's just netherrack oh a bunch of arrows but all the redstone torches around it kind of freaked me out I'm not gonna lie I got a bunch of arrows now here's uh here's seven more alright here's what we're gonna have to do see how the floor is made out of obsidian yeah that's scary because there could be explosions here obsidian is resistant to explosions so like
[07:47.97]You know what I'm saying?
[07:48.53]Like, the floor won't crumble.
[07:49.79]Okay, I see.
[07:50.13]Whenever something explodes.
[07:51.95]So... Be careful when you're removing these redstone torches, because they could set off... Explosion.
[07:58.64]Yeah, so we gotta listen.
[08:01.96]Alright.
[08:03.52]We're good.
[08:03.88]What is that?
[08:05.72]Netherrack.
[08:07.15]So, is this just... That's it?
[08:08.49]There's nothing else here?
[08:09.39]I don't... I hope we don't just randomly explode...
[08:12.82]I feel like there should be, like, another area or something.
[08:17.74]Well, what's with, like, the broken edges on these walls?
[08:20.18]You know what I mean?
[08:20.62]See how, like, the walls are kind of cracked over here?
[08:22.30]Um, I... What's that mean?
[08:25.85]Yeah, that's... I don't know.
[08:27.57]Ooh, there's another area.
[08:28.55]Good find, Jerma.
[08:30.07]Good find.
[08:31.43]Watch out, that's lava.
[08:35.53]Can you get that chest without...
[08:37.01]Ooh, a golden sword, which is not the greatest thing in the world, but there's another one over here.
[08:42.13]Okay, do you have a pickaxe?
[08:44.16]Did I already ask you that?
[08:45.06]I do not have a pickaxe.
[08:46.46]Here, take mine.
[08:47.40]I've got a lot more stuff than you, so break the other side.
[08:51.64]I'm really scared something's going to explode in here.
[08:53.62]Alright, here we go.
[08:57.64]I'm trying to stay as far back as I can.
[08:59.39]Alright, it's a very long hallway and a sign.
[09:04.19]You can have that back.
[09:08.32]Uh, you want me to go first?
[09:09.90]I guess, man.
[09:10.70]Obsidian Hall.
[09:11.75]Well, nothing can get through us in this hallway.
[09:14.27]Shivering Sands.
[09:15.57]One record.
[09:16.15]So this is a whole other area, it sounds like.
[09:18.87]Wow.
[09:20.18]Apparently you dropped down.
[09:23.30]That looks kind of sketchy.
[09:24.70]I know.
[09:25.00]I don't know about that.
