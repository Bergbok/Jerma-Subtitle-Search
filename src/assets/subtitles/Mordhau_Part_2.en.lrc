[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.54]Okay.
[00:03.06]Hello.
[00:05.34]Alright, so... Here are the options.
[00:08.69]We can do the start season two.
[00:12.01]And do, like, episode one.
[00:14.93]Or we can wait.
[00:16.31]And actually dedicate... A whole stream to doing, like, two to three episodes.
[00:26.10]Or...
[00:27.63]I open up Mordhau.
[00:29.67]And now that progression actually works, I'll be able to play and level up and buy stuff and actually progress in that game.
[00:40.93]Those are the two options.
[00:45.14]I'm probably... I don't know.
[00:48.18]I'm not sure.
[00:48.76]I'm leaning towards...
[00:54.88]I'm torn, because I really want to level up in Mordhau just because I want to see what's in the game.
[01:01.96]And then we can save Season 2 for... give it its whole stream, give it... so I don't have to just do one episode or one and a half episodes or something.
[01:14.01]Alright.
[01:21.57]Yeah, I think that's what's gonna happen.
[01:28.34]We're going to play Mordhau for a little bit.
[01:32.25]And then Sam & Max Season 2, we'll dedicate it so we don't have to have it be, you know, one episode spread out and then two episodes.
[01:41.47]I'd rather just do two or three episodes in one night.
[01:49.86]But Season 1 concluded.
[01:57.66]Why ask?
[01:59.42]I'm just curious, you know?
[02:03.66]I mean, I'm going to do what I feel like I would have the most fun doing right now.
[02:09.05]You know?
[02:11.29]Season 2 would be fun, but I'd rather dedicate it to a whole stream.
[02:19.69]I didn't put a poll up.
[02:23.89]I was just deciding.
[02:26.27]I didn't put a poll up.
[02:26.89]What are you talking about?
[02:36.42]If I had put a pole up and left to go to the bathroom and come back, then yeah, I... I didn't put up a pole.
[02:43.05]I was just torn on what I was gonna do.
[02:50.19]Alright.
[02:51.11]So.
[02:52.63]Let's change this over.
[02:55.71]Plus, I wanna see what's in that game.
[02:58.00]We didn't get a chance to see the other items.
[03:10.04]I did do a pull.
[03:11.22]Yeah, I did the, what, I did what color am I pull?
[03:25.54]How do you do the degree symbol?
[03:29.04]It's like a little, it's a little O, right?
[03:38.02]Because I can't, how do, yeah, it's fine.
[03:42.88]That does not look correct, but who cares?
[03:45.02]360 O's.
[03:45.12]All right, let's open it up.
[04:12.15]Alright.
[04:13.33]Thank you for watching Sam & Max.
[04:14.53]It will return.
[04:15.93]We will properly do Season 2.
[04:30.98]That's not a lie.
[04:33.04]Look, if this was going to be a Jerma lied about Sam & Max scenario, you wouldn't have seen Season 1 today at all.
[04:40.51]I would have been like, yeah, I don't know.
[04:42.03]I think I'm bad.
[04:42.71]I don't know if I'm bad.
[04:43.47]I don't think I'm going to do it today.
[04:44.73]I would have been like, nah.
[04:55.20]I don't think so.
[04:55.92]Maybe next week.
[04:59.34]I didn't want to conclude it, though.
[05:02.86]All right.
[05:03.66]Open.
[05:06.03]Hopefully this is not too loud.
[05:07.11]It might be.
[05:18.07]Lying about Minecraft story mode.
[05:27.53]Oh shit, I was trying to mute this.
[05:32.98]Everything has to be loud as fuck, don't you guys know?
[05:39.56]So let's go over the, let's see, what's on tap here?
[05:42.10]We got...
[05:44.99]Monday... Wednesday I want to do Dreams stuff.
[05:51.08]So, we'll probably... So, Dreams is Wednesday.
[05:55.44]Thursday... I got something I want to do on Thursday.
[05:58.98]Alright, so here you go.
[05:59.98]Here's the block out for this week coming up here.
[06:04.07]So, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[06:06.81]And then probably Sunday.
[06:07.57]If that makes the most sense.
[06:10.07]So, we'll do Season 2 of Sam & Max.
[06:12.11]We'll probably start it on Friday.
[06:16.54]Dreams is coming back because I want to show you some things that I've made.
[06:23.88]So, like, hopefully I can get some shit to see.
[06:27.01]And if anybody else has made anything, if you haven't, if nobody's done anything, then whatever.
[06:31.09]You're not expected to.
[06:31.93]Alright, here we go.
[06:43.14]Now, the question is, will this work?
[06:47.07]Will you work?
[06:48.89]Is progression functioning?
[06:50.13]Because I really want to see what's available in the game.
[07:01.16]Okay.
[07:04.06]It does.
[07:04.58]Thank God.
[07:05.16]Good.
[07:10.24]So, let's test this theory.
[07:11.81]I'm going to search for a Battle Royale.
[07:14.51]I can remember how to play.
[07:18.50]Don't do BR, please.
[07:21.90]Look how quick that was.
[07:22.80]That was in seconds.
[07:31.43]He's turning into a normie streamer.
[07:33.71]No, no.
[07:34.23]I just wanted to see.
[07:35.69]Yeah, last time this barely worked.
[07:44.67]Alright, I remember in this is the stab.
[07:46.25]This is the feign.
[07:48.69]Oh, I forgot you can kick.
[08:02.30]You can kick.
[08:02.72]What's kick?
[08:04.20]What is kick?
[08:06.04]Oh, I remapped it.
[08:06.74]I remapped it.
[08:07.22]There it is.
[08:19.28]Does this play better than Chivalry?
[08:22.34]Um... I have this weird memory of Chivalry where... I remember playing it a lot, but I kind of don't.
[08:32.07]I feel like I'm having more fun in this game than I did in Chivalry.
[08:37.35]Like, I don't remember, like, really that much about Chivalry.
[08:39.83]It's been too long.
[08:42.57]Alright, last time I did this, there was, like, ten people in each one of these.
[08:49.20]Rock and a bandage.
[08:51.12]Oh god, I got a rock.
[08:51.74]Okay.
[08:52.86]Is that all that was in there?
[08:54.83]Five ammo.
[09:02.73]I need to move.
[09:03.29]I'm freezing.
[09:04.97]There's a chest right there.
[09:06.47]There's like two chests.
[09:08.65]God damn it.
[09:09.09]I hope they didn't... I'm surrounded by chests.
[09:16.52]Alright, I got a falchion.
[09:18.84]Is it a bear trap?
[09:21.96]I'm just going to put it down right next to the chest.
[09:26.78]And I need a shield or something.
[09:29.14]Shield?
[09:30.30]Okay.
[09:35.38]What is this?
[09:36.72]Light chest.
[09:37.32]Okay, it's on.
[09:40.83]Ah!
[09:41.81]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[09:43.77]That hurts so bad.
[09:46.41]That scared the shit out of me.
[09:57.32]Why did that just scare me so much?
[09:59.10]I'm outta here.
[10:01.70]We're not doing Battle Royale.
[10:11.59]Frontline.
[10:12.93]Let's do matchmaking.
[10:15.11]Okay, it's time for Season 2, Episode 1 of Sam & Max.
[10:37.40]Come on, give me a server here.
[10:38.38]Come on.
[10:40.89]I'm trying to get in your game.
[10:50.09]Come on, Battle Royale took like 10 seconds and the other fun game mode is not going to take... Come on.
[10:59.42]Maybe I should try a different region.
[11:05.10]Or just go right in the browser.
[11:11.49]Any game mode is fine.
[11:14.37]There are a shitload of these servers.
[11:16.49]39 out of 48.
[11:16.89]Oh, goodness.
[11:21.73]This is gonna be a mess.
[11:27.08]There are 800,000 people playing this right now.
[11:29.84]Are you kidding me?
[11:34.26]There are 800,000 people playing this?
[11:40.87]That's insane.
[11:44.21]Let's just get in the game.
[11:50.21]It's 30,000, oh.
[11:50.53]I was gonna say, that's more than like Dota 2.
[12:02.05]This guy's so dead.
[12:06.49]I'm the one that get hit by that?
[12:07.85]Really?
[12:16.60]Yeah!
[12:19.28]Oh shit!
[12:19.86]I thought he was red!
[12:22.20]Oh boy, too many people.
[12:28.29]Do... Do-o-mega-lul-ota.
[12:38.63]Fucking Omega LOL.
[12:46.02]Why do I find that so funny?
[12:50.46]Yeah, I chopped off his arm, mate.
[13:01.45]Alright, here we go.
[13:07.99]How do I...
[13:09.29]There we go.
[13:09.63]I wanted to throw it at him.
[13:12.73]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[13:17.64]I didn't mean to.
[13:18.74]I didn't.
[13:19.18]I promise.
[13:24.66]Damn it.
[13:29.05]I'm going for a stab.
[13:32.33]Shit.
[13:35.15]Damn it.
[13:36.59]Oh, I stepped in the fucking fire.
[13:46.82]Spawn here.
[13:50.78]I gotta do more faking.
[13:51.86]I like the fake into the stab.
[13:54.04]So you go like, I'm gonna stab!
[13:55.76]That works a lot.
[13:56.64]It's really, really hard to defend against that.
[14:05.87]I just want to unlock a new weapon.
[14:12.45]Alright, here we go.
[14:13.21]Up here.
[14:16.31]Oh, fucking bear trap.
[14:20.23]I was so tunnel visioned into trying to hit this guy.
[14:22.29]Oh, shit.
[14:37.68]Damn it.
[14:45.99]Come on.
[14:50.21]Professional gamer.
[14:53.07]Well, not really.
[15:00.40]Oh, that's way too many.
[15:01.62]This is bad.
[15:09.69]Really?
[15:09.91]That didn't hit him?
[15:14.86]Who even killed me?
[15:17.04]I don't even know what happened to me.
[15:23.26]Let me change classes.
[15:25.04]How do I change classes?
[15:27.85]Right there.
[15:31.09]It was me.
[15:37.29]Oh, that was the last stand.
[15:38.27]Right, right, right, right, right.
[15:38.97]You're right.
[15:44.30]Really?
[15:46.20]Really?
[15:48.30]What was that for?
[15:49.04]Now I have 50% of my health gone.
[15:52.78]He's just waiting for me to land.
[15:55.99]Watch out for this dude.
[16:11.48]He blocked it.
[16:15.93]Someone's gonna drop down here.
[16:23.87]Come on.
[16:26.11]Thank you!
[16:26.57]Watch out for the fire!
[16:37.12]No!
[16:37.50]That's not a guy!
[16:38.92]He looked blue.
[16:40.24]His left side is blue.
[16:41.14]He's like Two-Face.
[16:57.61]I didn't think he was gonna go straight into me.
[17:10.20]If I don't sprint, I'll regenerate HP.
[17:11.94]Good to know.
[17:12.36]Thank you.
[17:15.90]Heal by walking, not by sprinting.
[17:17.52]LOL.
[17:17.86]Idiot.
[17:31.40]Alright.
[17:32.16]Let's make something happen here.
[17:33.56]That guy blocked that from behind.
[17:38.33]How?
[17:39.05]I don't believe it.
[17:42.57]Shit.
[17:52.11]Nope.
[18:14.18]Okay, don't sprint.
[18:15.60]And just stand here and heal.
[18:17.92]That's so fucking funny.
[18:19.45]This game is... I love this game.
[18:23.49]Alright, I got him right in the head.
[18:34.96]Who's behind me?
[18:35.42]Somebody behind?
[18:39.42]Oh, God!
[18:40.10]What?
[18:47.37]Oh, this guy didn't even do the tutorial.
[18:49.31]What?
[18:50.69]You know, it's really annoying when these streamers just jump into a game and they just, like... They just play and they don't even do the tutorial and they talk about, like, what the fuck?
[18:59.62]What killed me?
[19:01.22]It's like you didn't stop and heal.
[19:02.76]I don't know what you're talking about.
[19:03.94]This game's like a fucking problem with the game.
[19:06.08]It's like you have to press Q to feign.
[19:08.42]He's not doing that.
[19:10.20]These fucking streamers.
[19:11.16]You know what I'm saying?
[19:23.43]Nope.
[19:32.59]You were taunting!
[19:40.75]Come on.
[19:41.39]Let's see it.
[19:46.20]Ooh!
[19:47.30]Clubbed!
[19:47.78]I'm going way too far up here.
[19:49.34]I gotta slow down.
[19:55.94]Getting too zealous.
[20:11.94]Whoa!
[20:15.74]What?
[20:24.53]That's... Okay, I died so fast and I spawned so fast.
[20:27.43]I just saw myself dead on the ground.
[20:32.39]We lost.
[20:32.81]Oh well.
[20:35.45]I'm not in the last place.
[20:36.63]Yes, I am.
[20:41.50]I thought I came in late.
[20:43.50]Come on.
[20:43.90]I'm not very good, but I still have fun.
[20:56.98]Last place.
[20:57.70]That's what losers say.
[21:02.64]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:19.79]You can't have fun while playing games, don't you know?
[21:22.93]That's the worst thing ever.
[21:24.25]Okay, let's go with... I don't know, maybe... Raiders, I like Raiders, it's fun.
[21:42.83]You shouldn't be laughing, this is your job!
[21:45.27]It's my job to be really good at video games.
[21:47.43]Come on!
[21:55.69]All right.
[21:58.39]I'm ready.
[22:00.69]I hate it when Jerma has fun.
[22:02.09]Why?
[22:04.60]Do you want me to be mad and talk about, like, I'm not, this is fucking not even fun.
[22:08.35]Like, this is, like, seriously, like, fucking not even fun.
[22:09.77]It's, like, too hard and stupid.
[22:11.59]Like, everyone's too good at the game and I don't fucking like it.
[22:13.41]It's, like, we play against people that have been playing for, like, 50 hours today.
[22:15.71]It's, like, not even fun.
[22:17.23]You want me to do that?
[22:18.39]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[22:19.31]I'm gonna have fun.
[22:28.26]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[22:33.87]This guy in the corner here, I'm going to go overhead.
[22:35.31]Like that.
[22:41.51]Holy shit, that guy killed everybody.
[22:45.53]Easy with that.
[22:48.05]Don't come in too hot here.
[22:49.49]Somebody behind me.
[22:50.99]Ah, shit.
[22:55.37]You have to be monotone and serious.
[22:56.89]Fine.
[22:57.11]Is that what you want?
[22:58.71]Here we go.
[23:35.82]Oh, fuck, I'm laughing.
[23:36.62]I'm not supposed to be doing that.
[23:47.80]Hey!
[23:49.70]Why do some of you do this to me?
[23:52.90]That's not nice.
[23:54.74]Oh, that was a legit misclick.
[23:56.74]Okay, alright, no, no, it's okay.
[23:58.06]That's fine.
[24:11.28]Fuck.
[24:15.94]I'm getting so outplayed, fuck.
[24:30.57]Died to stick, well there were four of them over there.
[24:42.94]Oh god, this is... That's the one thing I didn't like about crossbows.
[24:47.85]They take too long to reload!
[25:08.38]That's the one thing I don't like.
[25:14.09]What?
[25:14.63]What happened to my weapon?
[25:26.70]You don't even know who's here.
[25:28.16]Somebody's coming behind you.
[25:30.41]Good job.
[25:33.57]What happened?
[25:39.63]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[25:40.65]Chat's gonna yell at me.
[25:43.07]Where's my, where's my health?
[25:44.23]There we go.
[25:45.41]Hey!
[25:47.79]What just hurt me?
[25:49.97]Did I get sniped?
[25:58.50]Don't, I'm trying to heal.
[25:59.72]Get the fuck out of here.
[26:05.00]I would have had more health.
[26:17.01]Too many.
[26:24.89]Really?
[26:34.40]That was a weird arc there.
[26:45.99]Attention, horses in the stables.
[26:54.56]Red team OP.
[26:55.90]The blue... It's quite funny, the blue team generally team kill more due to people mistaking them for red players when they are low health because of their blood.
[27:04.89]That's so funny.
[27:12.30]I've definitely been guilty of that at least five to ten times.
[27:28.73]Ooh!
[27:29.13]What are you doing?
[27:40.97]What?
[27:41.89]What are you doing?
[27:43.49]That guy just ran into the wall and died, I think.
[27:53.42]He put up the wall and the guy, like, bugs-bunnied into it.
[28:07.47]That didn't hit him.
[28:12.22]Uh-oh, watch it!
[28:13.02]No, dude!
[28:19.00]Shit.
[28:21.86]You can't hear the game.
[28:22.92]What?
[28:28.21]No, dude!
[28:30.39]It's really quiet.
[28:34.03]Is it?
[28:37.63]Is that better?
[28:38.77]Should be.
[28:48.04]Uh-oh.
[28:49.06]Getting a little bit of frame droppage here.
[29:03.39]Fucking goddammit.
[29:04.97]The guy playing the harmonica or whatever it was just got crushed.
[29:15.82]I get too distracted by the funny things on screen.
[29:20.54]Alright, let's go.
[29:32.29]Come on.
[29:34.05]Got the roof.
[29:35.71]I... Where's that guy swinging at?
[29:48.91]This is too confusing, I'm going the other way.
[30:02.87]What?!
[30:03.79]Hold on, I hit that guy twice in the back and he's still alive?! !
[30:20.79]Was it the frame rate?
[30:21.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[30:25.92]Oh, he's got that perk, right.
[30:27.50]Okay.
[30:31.96]Oh, fuck.
[30:39.57]Nope, no way.
[30:52.37]Get those bastards!
[30:59.25]Enemy is capturing the stables.
[31:00.71]Not good.
[31:01.31]Alright, we're gonna go shirtless guy in here.
[31:09.59]Ready?
[31:11.11]Huck?
[31:20.76]I'm in the middle of everybody now.
[31:22.36]We both did the same thing.
[31:26.70]I'm trying to go around the corner and like hit him in the face.
[31:31.56]I was doing okay.
[31:34.90]I was in like the top five and I'm dropping down.
[31:37.13]Let me get another couple kills here.
[32:03.01]Minus 67.
[32:03.33]Alright, I'm gonna wrap around.
[32:11.06]Watch this.
[32:11.36]Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch this strategy.
[32:13.86]Never mind.
[32:14.70]There was no... Never mind.
[32:15.74]Never mind.
[32:20.55]I was gonna wrap around that guy, but he backed up too much.
[32:22.99]I thought they were gonna fight in the tunnel together.
[32:38.89]Hold on.
[32:44.91]Ooh.
[32:46.79]Oof.
[32:48.11]Should I?
[32:48.89]No.
[32:49.53]Bad idea.
[32:55.80]Hey!
[32:56.44]I'm just trying to heal!
[32:58.38]Wait, was I blocking?
[32:59.20]I think I was blocking the whole staircase.
[33:11.86]Up here.
[33:20.65]Got it!
[33:21.81]Somebody ran all the way over there.
[33:23.13]This guy doesn't know.
[33:28.91]Stay out of his peripheral, and we're gonna hit him right in the head.
[33:39.42]Damn it.
[33:47.07]Capture it.
[33:48.03]Alright, watch out for those spikes.
[33:50.21]Guy on the, on the, on the treachery belt, whatever, the trebuchet.
[34:01.76]It's our trebuchet now.
[34:07.80]Whoa, yeah.
[34:10.46]Now we got a string.
[34:11.74]Now we got a string!
[34:18.17]Fire!
[34:20.49]Horse!
[34:21.01]Horse!
[34:21.27]Give me the horse!
[34:23.53]What?
[34:31.38]What happened?
[34:37.28]It's because it was in the fire?
[34:41.10]Oh.
[34:45.99]The horse died to fire and then stumbled on me.
[35:10.57]Did that guy fall down?
[35:20.38]Is that a teammate?
[35:25.27]No.
[35:32.57]Damn it!
[35:33.01]Ooh!
[35:33.46]It went all the way around!
[35:49.25]I know what you're talking about now when you say they look like they're red.
[36:16.63]Everybody I try to hit.
[36:18.46]What are they?
[36:19.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:19.92]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[36:21.74]I mean, like, seriously.
[36:23.14]What?
[36:24.10]He just... It's like he's shooting rocks over.
[36:29.35]I gotta go visit this guy.
[36:30.43]I have to get over there.
[36:44.44]That was right in the back of his head.
[36:46.34]That was clean on the nape of his neck.
[37:11.31]He caught that one with his teeth.
[37:32.57]What you Is that all you got nice, oh, but it is a take to take me down seven oh
[38:02.73]How many?
[38:03.17]Eight?
[38:11.90]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click... Really?
[38:33.30]Level two.
[38:35.42]I should be much higher than that.
[38:36.70]Come on.
[39:03.33]Alright, I gotta get the trebuchet guy again.
[39:05.77]This time I gotta take his head clean off.
[39:13.23]Oh god.
[39:14.49]Oh god.
[39:14.85]Why are you standing there still?
[39:25.06]No!
[39:26.02]I can't play like this!
[39:27.38]He was alive alive!
[39:36.25]Ugh, he was probably rage typing.
[39:43.44]Definitely.
[39:45.58]Fucking idiot, why do I have to get on always the losing team?
[39:50.06]Seriously, like, I have to just stop team killing.
[39:53.93]Oh my god.
[40:04.41]I mean, okay, let me be fair.
[40:07.15]If you were riding in on a stallion, and you were going in for the kill, and there was a free target of me just standing there, and some dude just swungberger and cut your horse down and you fell off... I can't swing in here!
[40:44.72]That guy's so relentless!
[40:51.90]I couldn't fight him in there!
[40:56.27]Oh, wait!
[40:56.99]Right, you're right.
[40:58.17]Right, right, okay.
[41:01.45]I can hold it a different way, can't I?
[41:02.69]Right.
[41:18.56]Come on, right in the fucking head.
[41:19.80]Right in the head.
[41:22.06]Right in the fucking head.
[41:27.30]Ah, fuck.
[41:33.82]Crossbow.
[41:42.53]The horse is OP.
[41:45.20]Um, maybe I'm just not experienced in the game.
[41:50.44]But it's hard to control.
[41:51.34]Am I helping?
[41:59.46]No, not really.
[42:01.33]Oh yeah.
[42:14.92]Destroying these guys right now.
[42:16.70]This one's running.
[42:17.44]Please, close the door!
[42:18.62]Alright, let's get in there.
[42:33.47]This is not... Nobody can move.
[42:39.68]No, no, stop.
[42:40.50]Open the door.
[42:42.64]What have didnt you do?
[42:47.01]I'm just gonna stop moving.
[42:56.53]Ah!
[42:56.79]Ah!
[42:59.11]Oh shit!
[43:00.07]Guys!
[43:03.83]I got it.
[43:04.13]It's okay.
[43:04.47]Don't worry.
[43:12.68]Oh fuck!
[43:17.67]Close the door, close the door, close the door.
[43:28.54]What's he throwing in here?
[43:34.60]Oh!
[43:38.07]No, no, no, no, no.
[43:40.17]No, no!
[43:42.71]Where am I?
[43:43.49]Holy shit!
[43:45.77]Oh my god!
[43:52.55]What?!
[43:53.49]Oh ffffuck god!
[43:58.97]I was just in Super Mario World!
[44:03.00]How did I not get hit and how did I not hit anybody?
[44:08.70]The never-ending Bowser staircase.
[44:13.88]Can I open the gate?
[44:22.19]Nobody else fighting up here?
[44:23.35]Holy shit, where did you come from?
[44:24.63]Did you see what he did with his hands?
[44:33.84]He just, like, changed hands!
[44:38.96]He, like, switched hands!
[44:40.32]That was weird!
[44:56.67]Oh, this is bad.
[44:57.15]We can't just stop in here like this.
[45:02.46]Oh!
[45:18.25]Yeah, I know about Q. I use it sometimes.
[45:28.87]I know, but you can do stab into feint there.
[45:32.28]You can do a swing into a stab.
[45:35.20]You can Q. You can kick.
[45:37.22]You can kick into a kick.
[45:38.74]You can swing into a swing.
[45:40.18]Dude, if you just had not walked right there.
[45:49.04]You walked right in front of it.
[45:50.20]Alright, I get a heal.
[46:01.32]I did the tutorial last time, but it didn't count because the servers were down.
[46:05.44]So I would just be doing the tutorial for money.
[46:08.46]But I don't know if you guys want to see... I could do that off stream, you know.
[46:11.32]Do we really want to do that right now?
[46:12.48]I don't know.
[46:14.56]I don't know what's going on, right?
[46:17.16]I guess it is worth it for money.
[46:18.77]How did he die?
[46:32.81]How many more?
[46:33.61]One guy?
[46:35.79]Oh god damn it!
[46:39.53]I've seen too many episodes of TV!
[46:41.11]It doesn't work like that!
[46:45.68]The guy on the horse always wins!
[46:49.12]I was like waiting for and prepared to strike him down!
[46:54.46]I've seen too many fucking episodes of TV.
[46:56.36]Okay.
[47:10.94]I've played too many video games.
[47:12.48]I've seen too much TV.
[47:13.64]See you later.
[47:20.73]Oh, that would have been a fucking champ moment, if you ask me.
[47:24.47]Awww.
[47:41.08]How much gold?
[47:41.68]600 gold.
[47:46.96]Finally leveling up and getting money for playing.
[47:53.09]Nice.
[47:53.49]That wasn't last place.
[47:54.29]That was right there in the middle.
[47:58.03]Alright, one more game and then we're going to go spend some money.
[48:15.48]600, that's a lot of medieval money.
[48:17.34]Yeah.
[48:18.98]It is.
[48:23.31]This time we're gonna go... I'll go Protector this time.
[48:31.47]Why not?
[48:36.76]We have the smoke bombs, the mace, the shield.
[48:43.28]Can two people get on the horse?
[48:45.44]That'd be funny if you could.
[48:49.78]Archer on horseback.
[48:50.68]Let's see how this plays out.
[49:01.23]Are we gonna go?
[49:02.47]We're gonna lead the charge.

[49:52.63]Did that hit me?
[49:53.95]I think I got hit.
[49:54.79]No.
[49:55.93]I took it down right when he started swinging.
[50:02.99]Derma shield spam.
[50:04.08]I'm a protector.
[50:04.86]I'm supposed to get in front and put the shield out.
[50:07.96]Can I heal with this character too if I don't move?
[50:11.98]Yes.
[50:18.09]So it's only... See, it happens no matter what.
[50:23.77]Yeah.
[50:24.59]Guys.

[50:59.67]What?
[51:05.51]What?
[51:06.05]Why is he still on the horse?
[51:08.11]We got three people smashing him!
[51:19.30]Is that him again?
[51:29.88]No, that's our horse guy.
[51:31.04]Fuck.
[51:49.11]That didn't hit him?
[51:53.87]Archery is so hard.

[52:07.83]Oh, fuck.
[52:09.69]No, no, no, no, no.
[52:16.34]70 damage is pretty hard.
[52:23.08]That's only two shots to kill somebody in the head.
[52:26.50]What is a headshot?
[52:27.76]Is it dead?
[52:33.72]It's a dead shot is what that is.
[52:42.94]Damn.

[55:03.46]Alright, we're gonna stick with it.
[55:26.85]What are the brakes?
[55:40.64]Get out of the way!
[55:44.21]Is he chasing me?
[55:46.87]He's chasing me, isn't he?
[55:47.75]Alright, somebody else take this.
[55:53.64]I don't want it.

[57:17.86]He knows.
[57:18.41]He knows what I'm trying to do.
[57:19.41]That guy just kills himself.
[57:25.91]Come on!
[57:30.68]Thank you for the help.
[57:31.78]I appreciate it.
[57:47.59]Come on out.
[57:56.08]Why did that not run him over at least?
[58:00.30]I blocked it!
[58:01.70]Oh, where is he?
[58:08.69]I'm gonna hold it up like it's a sign.
[58:10.77]He's gonna get hit in the face.
[58:19.96]What happened to my bow?
[58:31.55]He knocked my bow out of my hands.
[58:36.89]Why is he... I didn't do that.
[58:42.25]I didn't do it.
[58:42.89]He got R1'd from above.
[58:46.92]Ugh.
[58:48.12]Ugh.
[58:54.66]He's running!
[58:55.86]He's running!
[58:58.13]Oh!
[58:58.71]Didn't get away this time.
[59:00.21]Sorry, mates!
[59:03.71]Ooh, I blocked him.
[59:15.46]This is bad.
[59:15.90]I gotta get out of this.
[59:38.15]Oh, I held up.
[59:40.23]I made it.
[59:41.27]I made it.
[59:43.52]I finally did it.
[59:44.44]Even for five seconds, I did it.
[60:08.31]I gotta get closer.
[60:14.97]Dammit.
[60:15.77]That guy distracted me.
[60:22.13]Wow!
[60:30.44]Come on, he's just standing up there!
[60:32.20]People throwing pans at him!
[60:39.95]I got a frying pan out of him.
[60:54.13]Oh shit.
[61:00.05]No!
[61:04.95]That guy has a lot of pans.
[61:18.06]Ah, I thought he was gonna step back.
[61:19.02]Alright, this guy's done.
[61:23.87]Headshot, three, two, one.
[61:25.93]He jumped.
[61:28.37]Watch this guy right here.
[61:29.13]This guy is just like fucking taunting.
[61:31.91]Oh, no!
[61:36.08]That guy was so dead.
[61:38.50]Speaking of dead guys.
[61:42.86]Yeah, speaking of the guys that are dead.
[61:53.00]Trying to take out my fucking... He blocked that, point blank.
[62:14.21]He's still up there!
[62:19.46]Oh, he's still there!
[62:27.44]Is he still?
[62:27.98]Are these even going?
[62:30.94]What's the drop like here?
[62:32.00]Am I shooting too low?
[62:32.88]Get the fuck out of here!
[62:40.99]Give me this thing!
[62:55.89]Oh shit, I can throw it.
[63:00.77]Alright, new plan.
[63:02.49]I'm going, uh... Let's go with this guy.
[63:13.72]Okay guys, short sword, fists.
[63:24.12]Alright, let's make something happen.
[63:46.00]Damn it.
[63:46.93]I'm so sorry.
[63:54.79]The guy with the hammer is seriously freaking me the fuck out every time.
[64:03.36]Oh, you can throw it.
[64:04.16]Okay, why was that just a weird, like, wiffle ball throw?
[64:23.68]Oh, that was a full baseball swing to his face.
[64:29.04]That's another one.
[64:33.05]Oh, that's another one!
[64:37.51]Oh!
[64:41.56]Who's doing that?
[64:58.00]Nice block.
[65:14.96]Oh!
[65:16.80]Come on!
[65:18.26]Glove him!
[65:25.38]Oh, it's... It's going crazy.
[65:30.55]Oh my god, I just... Ooh!
[65:50.79]He's gonna die, he's gonna die, he's gonna die, he's gonna die!
[65:55.01]Did he die?
[65:56.35]Why did he knock the countdown?
[66:01.74]Wait, how come... That's his territory?
[66:08.58]Oh, bullshit.
[66:14.88]I was waiting for him to have the four or five seconds countdown.
[66:27.73]Nice.
[66:41.35]Oops, I hit like four people on my team.
[66:47.84]That was like a hundred miles away.
[66:50.78]I reached across the Atlantic Ocean to hit that guy.
[66:58.54]They're killing their own teammates.
[67:11.55]What the fuck are you doing?
[67:12.77]Watch out!
[67:24.12]Oops.
[67:35.45]Oh, that stupid catapult just hit me right in the head.
[67:43.89]Dude, that- I wanna see a replay of that.
[67:46.67]The dude with the two pins.
[67:48.21]I came across.
[67:49.15]My sword was like 40 feet long.
[68:00.18]He blocked it.
[68:00.88]Nice.
[68:07.77]Come on, now take the bolt on.
[68:09.49]Sick.
[68:23.81]I need to heal heal heal heals somebody heal Damn
[68:59.96]What do I need?
[69:00.42]I need some more assists.
[69:02.56]I'm gonna go around the corner here and watch this.
[69:11.15]One, two.
[69:23.75]Yes!
[69:24.01]Uh oh, it's Pan guy.
[69:32.63]Seriously, every time... Everyone is getting clobbed by my weapon!
[69:43.08]Uh-oh.
[69:52.01]Dammit.
[69:58.93]Three pans no armor.
[70:00.29]He just runs up and I end up just clotheslining him every time.
[70:04.43]Sorry.
[70:14.53]I'm too busy fucking paying attention to other things in my mind.
[70:17.63]You piece of trash.
[70:27.99]Stop killing the guys with the loots?
[70:29.53]What?
[70:29.91]Why?
[70:31.06]Is that like a sandwich heavy or something?
[70:46.47]How is that not... Holy shit, that guy got hit by five weapons.
[70:59.37]It's too hard to pay attention to some of this shit, man.
[71:02.10]Seriously, like, I need... I gotta focus again like I just was.
[71:05.38]I gotta go out on top here.
[71:10.74]Well, no, I'm not gonna stop playing, but... I was so focused.
[71:17.90]Now I'm just laughing.
[71:33.07]That didn't block.
[71:39.87]Damn it.
[71:43.30]No!
[71:49.08]I'm so pumped right now.
[71:50.28]I gotta be in first.
[71:51.06]How much time is left?
[71:59.00]I just presented my crotch to him.
[72:09.93]Guys down here.
[72:13.03]Wrap around, see if I can poke.
[72:19.14]Damn it!
[72:20.26]A little too high.
[72:20.94]I still don't have that down.
[72:27.81]Again, this guy again.
[72:30.51]The guy with the pans.
[72:52.87]Here he is again, the guy with the pants!
[72:56.71]Ooh, good blocks!
[73:01.48]Give me it, give it to me!
[73:08.96]No!
[73:09.44]Fuck, I was gonna throw it at him!
[73:16.47]That guy is just a free- that loot guy is a free kill.
[73:37.48]There he is.
[73:37.86]Ah, my shin.
[73:48.67]Come on, throw it.
[73:49.43]Throw it at me.
[74:31.02]I'm like just desperately trying to kill this guy.
[74:42.77]Ooh, right in the back of the head.
[74:44.79]Damn, 35, 35, 14, 13, 10, seven.
[74:45.29]Help me!
[75:00.23]That would've been cool, wouldn't it?
[75:12.12]One day.
[75:14.38]One day I'll get it.
[75:14.88]Ow.
[75:15.82]Where the f- Is he dead?
[75:36.70]Shit!
[75:37.86]I'm getting so into this.
[75:41.63]Did you tell us tonight's Powerball numbers?
[75:43.65]8, 14, 77, 6, 2, 2.
[75:50.07]I guess.
[76:03.93]Holy shit, that guy hit me right in the head.
[76:06.15]Oh boy.
[76:06.77]Oh no, I think I'm gonna lose my first place here.
[76:20.58]Come on, I gotta get like a couple more kills.
[76:24.02]Right here.
[76:52.76]No!
[76:56.64]No!
[76:57.06]What the fuck?
[76:58.68]I probably could have done it if I wasn't being a dickhead.
[77:00.96]Oh, I really could have done that too.
[77:08.85]If I wasn't being such a dumbass, that probably would have gotten me another kill or two.
[77:19.29]Alright, I'll make a character now.
[77:20.53]Let's see what weapons I can unlock.
[77:30.97]All right.
[77:32.05]Armory.
[77:34.51]So let's go down here.
[77:38.39]What am I... What is this?
[77:39.41]Ain't gonna... What?
[77:42.45]Okay, so... Archer's Camp.
[77:46.85]Wanderer's Hood.
[77:48.09]Can't do that yet.
[77:53.79]None of these.
[77:58.17]Chain Coif?
[77:59.53]No, it's too much money.
[78:05.23]Lute, Smoke Bomb, Cleaver, Primary.
[78:07.43]Okay.
[78:10.37]A little Hand Axe.
[78:12.33]I feel like I'd like that.
[78:17.74]A Warhammer.
[78:18.94]Oh, I... Yeah.
[78:22.30]I think so.
[78:24.11]Warhammer is so cool.
[78:30.26]I need to be level 4 for these.
[78:31.94]I am level 4.
[78:34.56]Oh, 4 points, I see.
[78:37.00]Well, let's get rid of this shit.
[78:42.76]Okay.
[78:45.72]I want to do... I think I want to do Warhammer.
[78:50.32]Let's try Warhammer.
[78:53.43]Warhammer and...
[79:00.85]Targe is not bad.
[79:01.77]Greatsword.
[79:09.25]Hmm.
[79:12.95]Let's go with Maul.
[79:17.01]Executioner's Sword.
[79:18.07]Evening Star.
[79:23.05]Hmm.
[79:25.81]Well, I'm gonna keep the Rock.
[79:26.81]I think Warhammer Targe will be alright.
[79:30.71]Utility Head?
[79:33.97]Popular Head and Gothic Head.
[79:38.55]Holy shit.
[79:39.24]Okay, that's cool.
[79:40.52]Shaft.
[79:41.94]Hybrid Handle.
[79:45.10]Bar Handle.
[79:46.12]Leather Strap or Hybrid Handle.
[79:50.42]Is it just cosmetic or does it do anything?
[79:53.50]Man, I like that look better than this.
[80:07.21]Okay, can I upgrade the rock?
[80:11.52]What about chest mail?
[80:12.96]Torso, chain mail.
[80:16.00]I only have 480 bucks.
[80:19.80]Oh, shit.
[80:20.84]Well, that's okay.
[80:21.32]I can put this on.
[80:22.96]Shoulders.
[80:24.91]Basic shoulders is 300.
[80:26.01]Yeah, put them on.
[80:32.07]Okay.
[80:32.97]Arms.
[80:34.77]Anything for free?
[80:35.39]Okay.
[80:37.71]What do we got for perks?
[80:39.69]Fist damage, no.
[80:42.91]Uh, melee damage against structures increased, repair effectiveness, bloodlust, full health on melee kills.
[80:47.37]I mean, it's just, why would you not have that on?
[80:53.40]Passive, that's all I can do.
[80:56.46]Wow, your character looks good.
[81:00.76]Well, give me a break.
[81:01.84]He's got a little while.
[81:08.87]Okay.
[81:09.81]Alright, I think that's good.
[81:15.51]I'm gonna try the Warhammer.
[81:20.53]We have to keep playing to unlock cool stuff.
[81:25.47]Alright, back in it.
[81:28.21]Please put on a helmet.
[81:32.19]No, we don't need pants.
[81:32.87]Not yet.
[81:33.75]Not yet.
[81:36.60]Alright, this is official.
[81:39.06]5 out of 6.
[81:39.66]6 out of 48.
[81:41.62]Los Angeles.
[81:42.38]Mountain Peak.
[81:43.06]This is frontline again.
[81:43.96]Team deathmatch.
[81:47.50]Let's see.
[81:47.86]We'll do deathmatch.
[81:48.92]We'll just do standard deathmatch.
[81:51.57]Or maybe not.
[81:53.31]I do like the frontline maps.
[81:54.45]It's so much fun.
[82:04.11]I'm going back in.
[82:05.78]Do I not want to show the server?
[82:07.24]It's alright.
[82:07.80]I mean, at this point, it really wouldn't be that hard for someone to find the server I'm in.
[82:17.30]You know, it wouldn't take very long.
[82:23.58]Okay, so this is the Warhammer.
[82:24.76]What's its swing like?
[82:29.05]Cool.
[82:30.66]Is there another way to hold it?
[82:33.04]I can swing it around the other way.
[82:34.30]I can do the claw of the hammer.
[82:43.59]I wonder what the difference would be here.
[82:50.56]God damn it!
[83:08.57]I forgot because I was on the other team for so long.
[83:23.43]Nice.
[83:27.33]You just crit your teammate from behind.
[83:29.13]I know.
[83:30.23]I know it's fucking bad.
[83:43.77]Damn it, that didn't hit?
[83:47.11]Yeah, I'm assuming the Blunt is probably better for Heavy, right?
[84:14.16]Alright, whatever.
[84:18.88]Boink!
[84:20.42]Oh shit.
[84:49.12]Damn.
[84:49.94]Oh god.
[84:50.40]Alright, so I had the hammer switched the other way.
[84:53.68]It seems like he had light armor on.
[84:54.76]I was only doing 20 damage.
[84:58.60]Do I have that backwards?
[85:08.41]Nobody's playing the objective.
[85:11.27]The spike should be for armor.
[85:13.07]Yeah, I guess.
[85:13.77]I had it the other way around.
[85:25.81]Too many.
[85:26.07]Nope.
[85:30.66]Yeah, claw to pierce, hammer to bludgeon.
[85:32.60]Yeah.
[85:32.80]I don't know why I thought the spike was gonna do more damage to it.
[85:35.86]I've got peasant armor.
[85:44.91]This is a really, really fun game.
[85:48.59]It just... It's got... It hits all the notes.
[85:57.21]I can see you.
[86:00.07]Holy shit, your whole team's here.
[86:18.34]Oh dear.
[86:20.52]I killed him with the rock?
[86:22.84]It's just that I'm gonna go the other way.
[86:28.09]Yeah, okay.
[86:54.27]Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[86:59.62]Is that it?
[87:00.00]We got two more, right?
[87:12.67]Yeah, right in the face.
[87:22.63]Is that guy behind?
[87:24.47]Is this bad guy?
[87:25.83]It is.
[87:48.54]What?
[87:53.98]We lost.
[87:59.09]I must have drawn that one in the very end, huh?
[88:13.26]Nobody played the objective.
[88:17.68]You have to play the objective on the objective map.
[88:20.04]That's right.
[88:20.44]It's not just TDM.
[88:36.69]Oh, I like this map.
[88:43.64]Middle fighting in Warsong Gulch.
[88:45.34]That really is what it reminds me of.
[88:54.93]I want to get like a cross the mob rock kill.
[89:13.44]Can I reach from... I don't think I can reach.
[89:17.46]You can't reach it!
[89:24.31]Oh, damn it.
[89:24.89]Oh, well.
[89:32.07]Oh, God.
[89:33.60]Oh, God.
[89:35.32]That guy was just swinging over and over again.
[89:36.66]I thought he was going to faint, one of them.
[89:55.80]Alright.
[89:56.70]Here we go.
[89:59.30]This is not good.
[89:59.98]Too many of you.
[90:11.79]Come on.
[90:12.25]Pierce that armor.
[90:23.62]Kick him off!
[90:32.55]God damn it!
[90:33.40]There's too many of you!
[90:35.42]Ugh!
[90:35.96]I can't!
[90:37.70]Back it up!
[90:38.62]Ugh!
[90:51.63]Use rock.
[90:52.23]36.
[90:57.51]I feel like this is the wrong side again.
[90:59.09]It's gotta be...
[91:08.19]Jesus!
[91:08.79]Alright, desperate time's gone.
[91:12.07]That's not working out.
[91:12.95]I gotta go back to Brigand.
[91:15.15]I'm kind of getting rolled here.
[91:49.30]Who's playing the piano?
[91:51.74]What is going on?
[91:52.26]What's this music?
[92:03.89]I thought that was a little loot.
[92:05.51]Not like a band in a box.
[92:17.50]Alright, he's almost dead.
[92:23.12]Fuck.
[92:23.38]I thought there was a guy right here.
[92:26.49]There he is.
[92:29.11]Oh, no!
[92:30.29]No, they don't even see me!
[92:32.31]Oh, come on!
[92:48.25]Oh, the guy comes out of fucking stage left with a horse.
[93:06.01]This is bad.
[93:06.63]This is bad.
[93:07.79]Yeah, at least it got steamrolled.
[93:26.98]Play the objective.
[93:27.92]It's hard to play the objective when the other team kills all of your team and they're all still alive.
[93:36.13]You can't really walk out the door.
[93:48.54]Red always gets rolled on that map, do they?
[94:00.17]No, I'm going to get auto-picked.
[94:04.06]Just TK the loot guy.
[94:05.42]I can't do that.
[94:06.80]People will be mad at me.
[94:19.73]I have no idea what I'm doing on here, but I'm going to do it.
[94:30.27]Is there a way I can actually aim the sword?
[94:34.12]Oh my god.
[94:34.80]Well, that's my first experience trying that.
[94:40.04]I think he took my head off.
[94:43.00]Oh, he's using the lance, that's why.
[94:56.07]Killed off by stage, left by hordes.
[94:59.00]no I mean I saw where he was going I just he killed me all right let's go time to turn it back on oh come on with the horse
[95:39.41]I need to play as the Loop Man.
[95:40.65]No, I don't... Loop Man... I don't like Loop Man.
[95:43.33]Loop Man, you just do this.
[95:45.39]And, like, dance.
[95:56.20]Oh god, here he comes.
[95:57.10]I smelled him.
[96:14.20]Dude, can we just have the door fucking open?
[96:16.80]Does this have to keep going like this?
[96:30.07]No one has been able to take that guy off the horse.
[96:31.81]He's been running around in a circle for like eight minutes.
[96:50.07]Do it.
[96:53.02]You understand?
[96:53.56]That wasn't me.
[96:55.06]I may have been thinking it, but I didn't do it.
[97:25.25]I'm so concerned about everybody.
[97:26.76]There's somebody behind me too.
[97:30.94]Look at how bad we're gonna be.
[97:32.16]Look at the guy on the other team.
[97:35.90]We're getting beat so bad because that guy over there has 10 kills.
[97:44.67]One guy.
[97:45.13]His smoking is all.
[97:59.11]I just got instantly killed.
[98:00.35]Alright, I gotta stop looking at the guys standing still with the loots.
[98:06.89]They're distracting me.
[98:11.46]I'm not even looking at them.
[98:12.28]I'm facing the camera this way.
[98:40.20]Damn, I thought he was going to walk into it.
[98:41.80]Damn it.
[98:46.46]Fuck.
[99:10.81]Oh, God.
[99:12.72]Look at the kill feed.
[99:14.06]What the fuck?
[99:16.62]Well, all right.
[99:17.38]Give me a break.
[99:18.28]Come on.
[99:19.06]Look at this shit.
[99:37.05]I can't.
[99:38.09]I can't.
[99:39.05]I can't.
[99:42.08]Why is he going in a circle like this?
[99:58.27]Oh my god.
[99:58.97]Oh, my face is itchy.
[100:09.55]No, I can't.
[100:11.58]All I can hear is the music!
[100:32.25]Oh my god.
[100:33.05]I gotta change it up for something, man.
[100:38.33]I can't even do anything.
[100:45.42]There's a dude on the team with 34 kills.
[100:51.94]Somebody sign that guy up.
[101:05.79]Oh my god, they're just everywhere!
[101:07.51]It's almost like they have a double spawn rate!
[101:11.49]Are they spawning inside of this building?
[101:16.26]I'm gonna get him when he comes around.
[101:17.66]Watch this, I'm ready for him.
[101:20.85]I told you!
[101:23.81]I ripped him out of this fucking dimension.
[101:27.13]Who the hell is behind me?
[101:28.19]Oh, god.
[101:39.69]I didn't get vehicle damage.
[101:54.42]Finally.
[101:55.34]Maybe I'll do something with the bow.
[102:09.96]Gotta get on the objective, though.
[102:15.08]That went right through his body.
[102:20.20]Just stay on the cleaver.
[102:45.16]Alright, I'm on.
[102:45.92]I'm on again.
[102:46.44]I'm turned on again.
[102:51.88]Oh, fuck.
[103:00.88]He's turned on.
[103:45.00]Thanks for the shield Can I get anybody from back here?
[104:14.61]Probably not.
[104:23.11]There's a guy over here.
[104:32.67]No.
[104:41.63]I got a guy in the back.
[104:44.18]Do I win the prize?
[104:45.36]Is there... Will you leave me the fuck alone?
[105:05.65]Kill him!
[105:17.38]Please, I'm dead.
[105:23.32]Alright, I guess I'm gonna go with Raider for a while.
[105:25.23]There's not somebody back here, right?
[105:42.54]There is somebody back here.
[105:54.79]I helped.
[105:55.17]All right, heal.
[106:04.60]Oh, I took his head off.
[106:28.58]We did it!
[106:35.18]Oh, I thought I could get it down before he could.
[106:43.97]You really want that, don't ya?
[106:46.27]You really wanna get that, don't ya?
[106:50.97]You want it so bad, you can taste it!
[107:08.99]Oh, I was stuck on top of the horse.
[107:21.10]I didn't know that Labo supported this game.
[107:24.12]New to the Nintendo Labo.
[107:31.09]That was pretty sick.
[107:33.11]That was perfect.
[107:35.01]Streamer, look at the chat.
[107:38.14]What?
[107:38.80]What is it?
[107:40.58]Alright, I'm going right up the middle here.
[107:46.24]Thanks.

[109:12.93]Vehicle?
[109:19.99]Oh my god, he actually... Oh, hi again!
[109:47.88]Did I make my own class?
[109:48.74]I did make my own class, but I don't really have enough money to make a good class yet.
[109:55.73]I could do the peasant thing.
[110:03.27]I need more armor, I think.
[110:07.09]If I want to make a class.
[110:07.85]I'm walking around with no pants on.
[110:18.26]I got that- I tapped that guy so many times.
[110:20.42]There's no way he stays alive from that.
[110:23.58]He's been quadru- he's got a triple tap.
[110:43.17]I got this- they're surrounding me with pans.
[110:51.15]Alright, I'm gonna play something else.
[111:01.63]Hit the submit to the pans.
[111:02.86]I'm gonna have to become one.
[111:16.30]I'm gonna get some kills here.
[111:38.51]All right, we're pushing out let's go as a team we can do it Why are you over here?
[111:59.79]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[112:18.33]Loot Man gets revenge.
[112:46.38]Alright.
[112:47.28]How many?
[112:47.54]One guy over here?
[112:48.94]Guy on a horse though.
[112:50.56]No, that's our horse.
[112:57.34]Oh my god.
[112:58.02]They're doing like psychological warfare on me!
[113:24.97]No, that's too slow.
[113:25.63]I'm gonna go back to Knight.
[113:42.15]That guy has 67 fucking kills.
[113:45.45]Alright, new server.
[114:24.54]It's not gonna do anything.
[114:25.88]It's gonna take 30 seconds for someone to defy this fucking server.
[114:46.58]I like this map though.
[114:47.36]Alright.
[114:48.42]Fresh start.
[114:48.90]Let's go.
[115:23.88]Off fire!

[116:17.18]He's typing!
[116:18.42]Typing!
[116:20.81]Got the guy typing.
[116:21.86]Sick.
[116:42.09]Typing destroyed.
[116:43.45]I don't think he was typing that.
[116:44.65]I think he was typing, hey guys, I gotta go.
[116:47.85]Fuck.
[117:04.20]Are you faster than me?
[117:06.48]How are you still alive?
[117:15.22]I was trying to fake that.
[117:21.50]That's safe.
[117:22.06]Holy shit.
[117:36.99]Ooh, right in the mouth.
[117:46.24]Why do they always run?!
[117:54.53]Stand and fight!
[117:58.51]Oops!
[117:59.39]Whoa!
[117:59.81]Too many!
[118:08.28]Why are you running?!
[118:09.52]Why are you running, dude?! !

[118:30.32]Couple people here.
[118:31.10]Oh, come on.
[118:32.94]How?
[118:53.00]That wasn't a horse, was it?
[118:54.04]I thought that was a meteorite.
[118:57.20]Kick them.
[118:57.72]What did they do?
[119:04.77]It was a medieval meteorite.
[119:10.03]That's far too many.
[119:18.92]I...
[119:23.01]We all just got killed there.
[119:24.79]Five of us just died.
[119:46.86]Okay, let's go this way.
[119:56.60]Alright, move, move, move, move, move, move, we can do it.
[120:00.46]Oh, fire.
[120:04.35]Good, good, clear him out, clear him out.
[120:14.01]Fuck.
[120:22.86]There's really nothing I can do there.
[120:33.65]How long did it take?
[120:57.16]It's alright, whatever.
[120:58.20]He's on my team.
[120:59.01]It's fine.
[120:59.47]That didn't touch.
[121:18.28]Mmmmm.
[121:24.95]Hit and connect.
[121:31.81]That was fucking funny.
[121:52.20]Whoa.
[121:54.40]Well, that was a... Okay.
[121:55.94]That's not a good idea.
[121:58.61]Back to the team.
[122:01.71]What is happening?
[122:04.31]Oh my god!
[122:05.05]Well...
[122:33.86]Yeah, you can ride a horse in this.
[122:35.24]It's crazy.
[122:37.93]It's very fun.
[123:11.34]Dammit.
[123:12.60]Ah, somebody behind me.
[123:13.46]Fuck.
[123:13.76]Got killed by Rockman.
[123:30.53]Probably.
[123:31.05]You stabbed him in the back.
[123:43.95]Oh come on Just aim the thing there and just wait and then press the button.
[123:52.35]You'll kill four people Just keep loading it up Oh my god
[124:27.06]Yeah, let's do new game mode.
[124:29.22]And we're gonna bring the sample size down here a little bit.
[124:33.30]Instead of like 50 person servers.
[124:48.93]Okay.
[124:50.96]We've got... Core, Deathmatch, Death... We've done all frontline.
[124:59.49]This TDM... No, hold on.
[125:04.14]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[125:12.51]Hmm...
[125:21.37]Let's see what we got for Team Deathmatch.
[125:26.98]Team Deathmatch is fun.
[125:35.30]Do a dual server?
[125:39.12]Great screen, well I'm picking a server!
[125:51.74]No, let's bring down the player count and do a... Let's just do, like, some TDM.
[126:14.33]Alright.
[126:18.37]Whatever you do, don't press tab.
[126:22.38]No.
[126:23.32]It's just enough.
[126:30.83]Oops.
[126:32.06]I actually didn't mean to press that.
[126:33.54]I was trying to press Q.
[126:51.41]Fire, fire, fire!
[126:52.47]What?
[127:05.09]Oh, I got hit in the head.
[127:08.57]Don't touch that dial now, we're just getting started.
[127:23.46]There is this little congregation here of fighters.
[127:27.85]Well, I didn't want to hit anybody in the head accidentally.
[127:34.61]Alright.
[127:40.80]Easy.
[127:54.31]Nice.
[127:54.73]Good job.
[127:55.25]Really?
[128:22.88]I probably should have spun it around on that guy before.
[128:24.90]Oh, that was weird.
[128:53.38]Alright, here we go.
[128:54.92]Back in the action.
[128:55.94]I just didn't know which way to look.
[129:07.91]Left and right, both my blind spots.
[129:17.79]Okay, this is just TDM.
[129:23.84]How much is the game?
[129:24.46]I think it's 30 bucks?
[129:26.74]25 right now, maybe?
[129:27.42]Something like that.
[129:30.72]Oh my goodness, they're all over here.
[129:45.57]I gotta pick a spot and stay there.
[129:48.66]I'm just so... I keep trying to change directions.
[130:01.85]This guy's walking.
[130:02.43]Is this guy roleplaying?
[130:22.42]Oh dear, that was a mistake.
[130:26.10]Oh, that was a mistake.
[130:26.90]Was I enough of a bait for someone to get killed?
[130:43.01]Can I climb up the rocks?
[130:53.22]I'm just trying to be like the guy that runs in for this guy to stab him in the back.
[131:00.86]We won.
[131:17.05]I want to play like a full round.
[131:19.69]I keep joining and like in three minutes it's over.
[131:35.50]Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot, loot!
[131:38.54]No, no loot.
[131:40.44]I'll do my final round as a loot, okay?
[131:49.12]Ooh, this is fun.
[131:49.78]I like this one.
[131:59.25]Uh-oh, packet lost.
[132:03.31]That's not good.
[132:18.37]Okay, let's go this way.
[132:27.45]No, that's bad.
[132:28.03]Let me regen.
[132:36.36]Ow!
[132:38.58]No more glass bottles of gasoline!
[133:00.88]Good job.
[133:07.37]Kick him off!
[133:08.91]I think he did.
[133:19.93]I think he kicked him off.
[133:22.29]Looked like it, at least.
[133:30.66]Really?
[133:30.96]I thought he was going... I thought he was gonna get blocked by the guy in front of me.
[133:35.95]Apparently I just got hit right in the head.
[133:39.49]I thought that he was going after the guy right next to me.
[134:09.59]Let's do Raider.
[134:55.54]Oh dear.
[134:56.32]Oh dear.
[134:57.68]Oh dear.
[135:02.17]Not good.
[135:13.00]It's gonna be an extra kick perk.
[135:15.00]That'd be nice.
[135:17.50]Nope.
[135:17.90]That's... Okay.
[135:19.19]Not good.
[135:21.37]Oh my god.
[135:22.05]I'm just gonna hang out back here.
[135:24.75]Let's go short here.
[135:56.11]No one else is running through here?
[135:59.23]Nobody else is gonna run through the door, huh?
[136:13.69]No bad.
[136:14.83]No bad.
[136:22.77]How do you have minus one?
[136:23.97]Oh, from team killing.
[136:50.96]Too many, fuck.
[136:55.28]Wow, I just, I got spun around.
[137:02.07]Man, I just can't get anything going.
[137:27.66]No.
[137:29.12]Oh my god, I'm doing so bad right now.
[137:35.78]I need like a smaller weapon.
[137:37.08]Give me the scoundrel.
[137:43.30]Green and yellow would be better.
[137:46.50]That's actually a good idea.
[137:47.48]He's going this way.
[137:54.26]I didn't block it.
[137:57.54]He was doing the same thing, waiting for me.
[138:21.35]I just have to play defensively here.
[138:36.52]Good job.
[138:45.53]Damn.
[138:47.27]Didn't think he was gonna get that.
[138:57.25]Get him!
[138:58.41]Somebody get this guy!
[139:00.57]Oh f- This is fucking Superman!
[139:04.81]We can't kill this one person!
[139:10.29]He just ran around and got hit right in the face.
[139:28.73]Oh, at least I wasn't at the very bottom.
[139:47.01]You haven't won a single game?
[139:49.91]Yeah, I'm one of 50 people.
[139:54.63]Is that really?
[139:55.13]I had like four people play Loots the whole time.
[139:58.25]Is that my fault?
[140:16.15]I can't carry?
[140:19.19]What?
[140:19.83]You really think that's gonna happen?
[140:25.49]The last game I had three people trying to pan me.
[140:30.07]I'm the variable.
[140:31.03]Apparently I am.
[140:32.25]Watch the sides.
[141:00.03]Sneak in.
[141:00.55]Sneak a little bit in.
[141:13.68]That heal.
[141:15.86]Oh boy.
[141:16.32]Oh boy.
[141:17.46]I need to heal.
[141:20.08]This is not a good place to heal in front of everybody.
[141:23.98]In front of... Ohhhh.
[141:40.14]This guy's just wildly swinging over here.
[141:42.70]Get him!
[141:54.45]This guy's still alive!
[141:57.38]What a fucking psycho.
[142:01.36]Aww.
[142:40.87]Right in the head.
[142:47.39]Come on, right in his face.
[142:49.09]No!
[142:58.72]Well, that was probably a bad idea.
[143:14.18]He ran into it and he just almost almost swung.
[143:16.64]And I just put my mouth up.
[143:17.90]I was like, yeah, take a picture of my mouth.
[143:23.78]He's right here.
[143:24.43]He just hit me right in the mouth.
[143:37.61]Oh, fuck.
[143:37.93]I didn't know there were that many people here.
[143:40.40]They'll kill each other.
[143:41.28]Good.
[143:54.60]Any behind?
[143:55.16]We both just did the same thing.
[144:01.05]Nice!
[144:02.51]Good work.
[144:05.29]Oops.
[144:37.64]Stick him!
[144:38.56]Stick him!
[144:40.78]Ugh!
[144:48.86]Let's see if I can sneak in my skewer here.
[144:50.90]I'm trying to hit that guy.
[145:14.67]Oh shit, got behind.
[145:16.85]Alright, I'll try to, after this map, I'll do a, uh, try to find, like, another server.
[145:31.31]Maybe we'll do some 1v1s, maybe.
[145:36.09]I don't even know which side I am.
[146:01.78]I helped.
[146:10.94]He just got stooged.
[146:20.78]I could smell that one all the way, all the way over here.
[146:27.96]I'm going down.
[146:29.60]Yep.
[146:30.48]Ah, shit.
[146:31.22]I got locked up.
[146:42.30]This game is very squelchy.
[146:43.62]What do you mean squelchy?
[146:45.38]Squelchy!
[147:01.56]Dammit.
[147:03.17]One in front, one behind, not much you can do.
[147:08.73]Does Jex do games like this or only shooters?
[147:12.40]Uh, Jex does anything that I ask him to.
[147:17.38]As long as he's had enough rest.
[147:20.78]Usually he's like seven months.
[147:24.57]Seven months of rest.
[147:41.30]Oh, fuck.
[147:47.49]Dammit.
[147:55.41]Jax is just Jerma's competent alter ego.
[147:58.31]Yeah, that's true.
[148:01.10]Alright, let me get into like a... We'll do a little bit more.
[148:13.41]We'll do some duels.
[148:18.34]Are there any official duel servers or do I have to find like a custom one?
[148:33.37]I don't think there's any official ones.
[148:42.30]Let's see.
[148:49.69]Alright, we got 1v1.
[148:51.07]I don't want 32 people though.
[148:57.06]Duels.
[149:03.32]U.S.
[149:03.64]West 1v1s.
[149:05.64]That looks pretty good.
[149:17.93]Alright.
[149:20.01]1v1s.
[149:25.18]How does one determine?
[149:27.66]Do I just pick an opponent and we go?
[149:29.20]Alright, guy with the t-shirt on.
[149:41.32]Alright, do I say yes?
[149:49.89]I think we just fight.
[149:51.17]Hey, get... No!
[150:11.99]I can't even, man.
[150:32.16]I seriously can't get over that.
[150:39.36]He just got right up and started swinging.
[150:41.52]I guess it's you and me again.
[150:52.54]Oh boy, I'm just getting fucking killed by this dude.
[150:59.01]Hey you!
[151:08.17]Oh, fuck, that was long.
[151:16.34]Shit!
[151:17.22]I was pretty much over-connected that.
[151:27.32]Like that?
[151:27.76]I don't know what to do here.
[151:34.22]This is... Okay, you and me.
[151:44.65]Damn it.
[151:48.20]He's quick.
[151:57.64]I've tried to flourish, but... Where do I go?
[152:16.45]Over here somebody I need to get back in line.
[152:23.52]Where's the dual line?
[152:29.47]Hey you I guess we could fight each other wait, hold on I gotta
[152:58.05]I need to heal first.
[152:58.83]Alright, Mew Mew.
[153:07.86]Ooh, good.
[153:32.27]Uh-oh!
[153:33.07]No!
[153:33.43]I could have pressed 2!
[153:37.67]I forgot I had another sword.
[153:43.20]Okay, you two fight.
[153:43.86]Alright, let's go Minecraft Steve.
[153:49.70]That's exactly who this person's playing as.
[153:53.17]Like, this is Minecraft Steve.
[154:03.60]That's a big swing wind-up, too.
[154:05.68]He's dead.
[154:06.04]I need to heal.
[154:11.40]Okey-dokey.
[154:13.96]Don't do that.
[154:14.44]Not nice.
[154:22.77]Really?
[154:23.13]Okay.
[154:28.57]Well, I... This is... I was supposed to fight this guy right here.
[154:39.54]Did I cut his hands off?
[154:41.04]I'm so confused right now.
[154:46.94]I think I chopped off both that guy's hands.
[154:48.56]Ah, I thought he was gonna fake.
[155:23.73]Alright, that's not fair.
[155:24.85]Alright, reset, reset, not fair.
[155:27.49]Somebody's being a dick.
[155:29.23]Somebody's being a dick.
[155:32.98]Okay, here we go.
[156:08.25]He thought I was gonna fake, didn't he?
[156:13.60]He thought I was gonna fake.
[156:15.76]Alright, let's go.
[156:24.08]Dude, why is everybody naked?
[156:44.31]Over.
[156:48.75]That was fun.
[156:51.32]Am I?
[156:51.56]No, I'm not naked.
[156:52.16]I'm just default regular character.
[156:55.16]That's a lot of money.
[156:55.90]1100.
[156:57.54]No, no, no, never mind.
[156:58.22]Alright, I'm going to do this again.
[157:03.46]I'm going to do this again, but I'm going to do... Um...
[157:11.15]Maybe I want to play... I don't have enough money to buy anything.
[157:24.69]I'll try spear.
[157:25.31]Let me see.
[157:32.03]The tutorial is going to give you 2,500.
[157:33.58]Yeah, that's true.
[157:34.58]That's true.
[157:42.53]So, can I... Spear is obviously you want... Is there a way to... Because you don't ever want to swing a spear, right?
[157:52.67]It's all about stabs.
[157:59.68]Oh, fuck.
[158:03.58]He's relentless.
[158:04.76]Damn, alright.
[158:09.66]He just was right up in your face with the dagger.
[158:13.69]I don't really like the spears.
[158:15.05]It almost feels like... It feels like I'm trying too hard to stab.
[158:48.06]Whoa!
[158:49.00]That was a little laggy.
[158:52.08]Get a halberd if you want to swing.
[158:53.56]Yeah.
[158:54.78]I can unlock it.
[159:01.40]It's all about spacing with the spear.
[159:05.28]Yeah, I guess I just don't think about how long it is.
[159:09.54]That's really long.
[159:20.77]Ah, nah, I don't like it.
[159:22.17]I don't like it.
[159:24.05]I don't like it Let's go raider All right, let's do it you and me
[160:11.20]Alright, I'm gonna- my stamina is- I'm freaking out!
[160:24.52]Okay!
[160:29.26]I just got really panicky.
[160:33.44]Chamber, you casual.
[160:34.44]I don't even know what that means.
[160:50.06]Oh, he tried to throw that at me.
[160:54.91]If you stab at a stab, you will chamber.
[160:57.13]Okay.
[161:00.30]I think we have the wrong idea here.
[161:02.12]I don't know who... Alright, I guess I'm fighting you.
[161:22.51]That was you?
[161:34.46]Oh.
[161:41.92]Not that he's going to fake.
[161:47.19]Ooh, nice.
[161:48.53]Damn it.
[161:53.91]Flourish.
[161:54.67]Yeah, I know how to flourish.
[161:56.01]Am I supposed to do that every time I want to fight somebody?
[162:22.80]I think I must have got him right in the good spot.
[162:41.37]Ooh, that would have hit me.
[162:49.13]Hello, Steve.
[162:51.81]Oh, I was gonna Flourish!
[163:09.61]Ooh, that's a wind-up.
[163:21.28]The pickaxe is really cool because it has a huge windup.
[163:47.70]Chop his legs off!
[163:51.52]I haven't fought you, I don't think.
[163:53.96]You.
[163:54.76]Right there.
[164:10.84]Little belly poke.
[164:17.25]That's not how you hold a sword, he's trying to blunt me.
[164:21.02]Okay, yeah, sure.
[164:38.01]Ooh, that, like, double pump.
[164:39.65]Nice.
[164:40.67]He does, like, that, like, fake, fake pump.
[164:43.81]Minecraft Steve coming in.
[164:55.83]Oops.
[165:07.44]I tried to fucking fake it out.
[165:09.28]Holy fuck, I didn't think that was gonna happen.
[165:17.30]You never expect somebody to throw their weapon.
[165:34.16]Whoa, what are you trying?
[165:35.30]What are you trying to pull here?
[165:36.30]Oh, hand guy.
[165:46.04]I got a little too close.
[165:58.23]Damn.
[165:59.31]That was fun, though.
[165:59.97]Good job.
[166:15.21]I can't play after that one.
[166:17.99]Alright, let's try this again.
[166:21.45]Let's try this again.
[166:22.58]Wrong thing, this thing.
[166:25.28]Damn!
[166:30.42]Oh, that's fucking dirty!
[166:31.98]That sword is awesome!
[166:38.30]I wanna fight big guy with huge sword again.
[166:58.16]Nice.
[166:58.40]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, nope, nope, no, he did it to me too.
[167:10.33]Oh, did I kill him?
[167:13.59]Whenever somebody drops their weapon, they just get, it's like panic syndrome.
[167:17.35]They just get right in your face.
[167:19.87]All it takes is one little punch.
[167:35.10]Uh, I guess I'll do you.
[167:41.34]Whoa, that was weird.
[167:48.22]Wow, he's like, spinning!
[167:52.23]It's like he's starting over here and he ends up like over here, it's weird.
[167:54.41]Let's try it again.
[168:06.72]Nice.
[168:08.14]Ooh.
[168:12.81]Oh, that guy.
[168:13.55]This guy's good.
[168:15.71]Damn it.
[168:19.65]Again.
[168:27.28]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[168:39.44]Sorry, I pressed the DPI button.
[168:48.80]No, I tried to switch it.
[168:52.31]I tried to switch it again.
[168:53.17]What the fuck?
[169:01.99]Good, good, good, good, good.
[169:02.81]Alright, I gotta fight this guy here.
[169:05.47]He's very good.
[169:06.95]He's very good.
[169:20.84]That little, like, ta-da!
[169:22.10]That little pump is so hard to predict.
[169:39.63]Dammit.
[169:46.61]Oh, not good.
[169:47.81]You wanna reset it, or how you doing?
[169:49.29]You good?
[169:54.87]What the hell was that?
[170:04.09]Wrong thing.
[170:24.64]Ooh, alright, that was a good poke.
[170:40.60]Okay.
[170:41.94]Whoa!
[170:44.82]I just opened the developer console.
[170:48.00]Sorry!
[170:48.88]Wait, get out of the developer console!
[170:52.36]He just like put his head down, he was like, oh shit!
[171:24.86]I was trying to block it.
[171:34.72]Do the tutorial for money and to get better.
[171:36.58]I don't know if I could get better from the tutorial.
[171:40.22]I know pretty much how all the things to do in the game except for I don't really chamber that well.
[172:01.46]This guy's very good.
[172:06.06]That guy is phenomenal.
[172:12.52]That guy is exceptional.
[172:13.66]Did I just- What the fuck just happened?
[172:30.29]I- Hold on, did I just swing and hit his-
[172:35.51]I'm so confused what the hell just happened.
[172:36.98]I just like hit him... I have no idea.
[173:09.15]No, but I already did the tutorial.
[173:11.19]I mean, I know what's happening.
[173:12.29]It just... It's not gonna help me.
[173:14.55]I did it the last time I streamed this game.
[173:17.41]The servers weren't on, so that's not counting.
[173:26.28]What the fuck?
[173:27.66]I'm so... What the hell is... Should I start going like this?
[173:32.40]Like, should I start, like, dragging my hands over to, like, help with the bait?
[173:39.95]Should I, like, put my sensitivity way up and, like, is it, how, how, should I do that?
[173:52.39]I'm getting kind of fatigued.
[173:57.20]Gamer fatigue is kind of settling in here.
[174:06.22]It's alright.
[174:09.47]Just push it.
[174:10.08]Hold on, I can... No, you can't.
[174:14.72]I have the DPI button as high as I can go.
[174:19.57]That doesn't really work that well.
[174:43.53]Damn.
[174:44.83]Alright, a couple more and then I'm probably gonna be done for today.
[174:58.57]Yeah, I just don't stand a chance when people are this good.
[175:06.09]No way.
[175:13.26]Yeah, I did promise Bard.
[175:14.18]I'm gonna play Bard one-on-one.
[175:17.04]Oh.
[175:20.80]Yeah, I'm tired.
[175:22.36]I'm getting... It's just, everything's blending together.
[175:24.74]I'll play one, and plus my DPI is so fucking high.
[175:29.64]Remind me to rip these buttons off, by the way.
[175:34.42]And fucking burn them.
[175:37.24]Alright, let's go Engineer.
[175:38.14]Engineer.
[175:48.52]Mom said it's my turn with the sword.
[175:49.94]Alright, here you go.
[175:51.96]Ready?
[175:56.64]I gotta play the song first.
[175:57.72]Alright, who am I fighting here?
[176:06.41]There's too many of you.
[176:08.21]Wait, what?
[176:22.77]I've never used this as a weapon before.
[176:27.53]Aw.
[176:38.30]Alright, last one.
[176:46.35]And then I'm gonna call it for tonight.
[176:52.01]Let's see if I can win with the loot.
[176:57.47]And there is no flowers with this thing.
[177:13.35]Get out of here!
[177:14.87]What the hell?
[177:15.33]Like I was going under the fucking bottom rope of the wrestling ring.
[177:33.78]I'm gonna die.
[177:34.50]Alright, I'm done.
[177:35.14]I'm done.
[177:39.10]I'm out of here.
[177:40.72]I can't do it anymore.
[177:42.00]Eh, it looked perfect timing.
[177:46.92]That was good.
[177:51.86]You know, I want to see people... The guy, the executioner's sword guy.
[177:57.11]I want to see two guys like that fight each other.
[178:00.47]I feel like that would be really, really cool to watch.
[178:06.77]That guy was, like, in another league.
[178:13.39]Let me get a... This game's really, really fun, though.
[178:18.09]I know I'm kind of just being, like, a silent tryhard sometimes during this stream, but... It's fun.
[178:23.88]Alright, last one.
[178:30.64]Actual last one.
[179:07.88]That was fun.
[179:11.96]Oh, that game's so fun!
[179:18.59]But yeah, that's gonna be it.
[179:21.27]So, I will see you guys... Thanks for watching Sam & Max and, uh, the kind of... part two of the stream, which was... dicking around on Mordhau again.
[179:31.15]If you got in to play some of those duels.
[179:36.40]Thanks for playing.
[179:37.70]Some of you guys are really fucking good, and that's really cool to see.
[179:41.34]Keep playing.
[179:42.72]And keep kicking ass.
[179:49.36]So, you will see me on my return.
[179:52.07]What was part one?
[179:53.27]We did Sam & Max season one finale.
[179:57.43]So, you will see me again on Wednesday, because dreams.
[180:04.55]Dreams is going to be on Wednesday.
[180:05.61]I'm going to bring you guys a couple of things, hopefully, that I've been able to make.
[180:12.76]And if anybody else has anything made, we can go through it as well.
[180:18.18]If they have, it doesn't matter what it is.
[180:19.64]We'll just kind of chill and play it.
[180:21.70]And then, after that, I might move on to something else for PlayStation 4, too.
[180:28.50]Because we're going to have the PS4 plugged in.
[180:29.84]So if we do that for like an hour or two, a couple hours of showing stuff off...
[180:34.02]Maybe we'll hop into something else.
[180:35.92]And play for the, you know... Because I do like to... Unless it's a big event or something, I like most streams to go at least, you know, five and a half to six and a half hours.
[180:50.15]But thanks for watching.
[180:50.83]I'll see you guys soon.
[180:55.93]On Wednesday, to be exact.
[181:01.46]There's a guide for Mordhauk.
[181:05.85]Yeah, I don't know, I might keep playing.
[181:08.73]I'm not sure how much more I'll stream it, but I think I'm gonna keep playing.
[181:13.29]Because it is just scratching a FPS, goofy, interesting itch.
[181:19.40]So... We'll see.
[181:20.88]Because I know I have like a ceiling of how good I can probably get in a game like this.
[181:27.22]So... If I ever do, you know, get to a decent level, which... I don't know, this is somebody... First person swinger?
[181:35.32]Yeah.
[181:39.40]But it is a damn fun game.
[181:41.32]I highly recommend it.
[181:44.42]So with that, we'll move on to the bits.
[181:48.14]Let's see here.
[181:49.80]There it is.
[181:53.27]So let's go back to about five and a half, six hours ago here.
[181:56.63]The skill ceiling in the game is huge.
[182:00.47]But honestly, you're doing great.
[182:01.67]You probably could get much better.
[182:02.91]Maybe, I don't know.
[182:03.59]Possibly.
[182:04.30]Possibly.
[182:12.45]It's really cool to see the people that are just already finding all the interesting things to do.
[182:18.26]It's the fainting that's just so interesting to me.
[182:30.57]It's a blast.
[182:32.11]Even though a lot of times I kind of get my ass kicked, it's still... It's still a lot of fun.
[182:37.43]But, Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50 earlier.
[182:40.59]Just want to say thank you so much for being there when I have a shitty week.
[182:43.25]Some days are really rough and it helps so much to stand outside your house at 2.13am every morning until 2.16am.
[182:48.80]That's terrifying.
[182:55.20]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the scariest bit message I have ever received.
[183:02.53]Because that is so specific.
[183:04.48]That... That's very... Thanks for the 250.
[183:13.60]Yeah, I came in and changed it.
[183:20.34]I woke up this morning and I was like, I feel like not that great, but I feel... I knew that by the afternoon I was going to feel better, so... And I did, so I didn't want to obviously... And I did say that we were going to do five days this week.
[183:33.28]And we did.
[183:36.60]So I did want to make sure that I adhered to that.
[183:45.03]Gotta be a VOD boy.
[183:47.29]This is a pretty good stream.
[183:48.81]I mean, this is... This is a pretty good rollercoaster weekend.
[183:52.93]Don't you think?
[183:53.27]You know, we went up the chain in the first part of Labo.
[183:58.65]We got to the peak.
[184:00.11]I got drunk and said a few swears.
[184:03.53]Just a few.
[184:04.35]And then we went down the roller coaster with the Labo drunk wine stream.
[184:08.13]And then, hey, look, we pulled into this Brakes for Sam and Max.
[184:14.63]A few.
[184:17.54]What was the name of the bacteria?
[184:19.56]It was Roigibiv.
[184:21.34]Mr. Bliss.
[184:22.62]Hublis.
[184:30.14]But yeah, thank you, Frodeon.
[184:33.02]I'll see you on, uh, Wednesday.
[184:35.30]If you'll be there.
[184:36.66]Uh, dflyers, thanks for the five dollars, dflyers.
[184:38.69]If you enjoy point-and-click adventure games, you should play the Submachine series of games.
[184:42.49]They have really good atmosphere and lore, as well as being free-to-play in standard definition.
[184:47.13]Where you can buy the HD versions.
[184:52.26]Speaking of Sam and Max, what is this?
[184:55.72]Oh, the Max head.
[184:58.42]Here, yeah, look at that.
[185:01.64]That is a perfect... That's perfect.
[185:07.26]Submachine.
[185:07.84]I do love point-and-click adventure games.
[185:12.18]Especially the odd ones.
[185:13.14]Remember we played a Harvester?
[185:15.80]That was a journey.
[185:20.88]Sam & Max is cool, too.
[185:26.65]When was the last time I got a sunburn?
[185:28.11]I got a little bit of sun a couple weeks ago when my mother was here.
[185:35.83]But, thank you, uh, dflyers.
[185:37.31]I'll look, I will, I'll type into Google right now, submarine.
[185:40.99]Submachine.
[185:42.87]Submachine.
[185:43.61]You know what this looks like?
[185:48.91]Um...
[185:52.03]I played a series of point-and-click adventure, almost escape room type games.
[185:57.86]Is this more like an escape room?
[186:02.08]What's the, uh, the series?
[186:04.44]It's called, like, Cube or something?
[186:06.14]There's like 10 parts of it.
[186:11.16]What is it called?
[186:13.58]It's called, like, The Cube.
[186:22.40]No, cube escape.
[186:23.36]Yeah, cube escape.
[186:26.04]Cube escape is... I've played all of them.
[186:28.88]They're really, really good.
[186:30.34]They're really interesting.
[186:32.52]But this kind of looks similar.
[186:33.80]Almost like a... Almost like an escape room.
[186:41.82]Which I love the room.
[186:44.08]That's my favorite adventure game escape room-esque type game.
[186:50.58]But Cube Escape reminds me of what you just linked me.
[186:53.16]You didn't link anything.
[186:53.88]I typed it into Google.
[186:56.83]But thank you for the recommendation.
[186:57.99]I will look into more of that off-stream.
[187:01.27]Mr. Comcast back again for $5.
[187:03.01]Hey, JermaJohn Comcast here.
[187:05.62]Just letting you know that I got a restraining order the other day, so I can't go near any washed-up YouTubers.
[187:11.12]Don't worry though, I'm working on it just for you.
[187:13.06]Anyway, in a completely unrelated subject, I saw you in Walmart the other day.
[187:15.70]I was gonna say hi, but then you started fighting the other children to get the last V-Bucks card that was sitting on the shelf.
[187:22.46]So I didn't want to disturb you.
[187:24.62]I found it weird when you started crying, though.
[187:30.33]Give me that!
[187:30.81]Give me that!
[187:33.01]Idiot!
[187:33.53]Idiot!
[187:33.87]Dumb idiot head!
[187:34.63]That's what I would do, if that were real.
[187:41.30]Hey, The Jack, thanks for the three dollars.
[187:42.70]You said you needed money to get Jimmy off the parking meter, so here you go.
[187:47.22]Hey, thanks.
[187:47.66]It worked.
[187:51.18]Snoozencopter, thanks for the 250.
[187:56.19]You mentioned Mordhau.
[187:58.33]And I played Mordhau.
[188:00.37]I saw Vinny stream Mordhau.
[188:01.51]I think you guys would play it together.
[188:02.89]Now that the game actually works, you can create your own character.
[188:05.71]I'd like to see that.
[188:07.18]Also, I was reminded about how some people here were talking about how they met each other because of your Discord.
[188:12.46]I didn't.
[188:13.30]And my girlfriend is almost getting jealous because I mentioned you so much.
[188:16.98]She kind of hates you now.
[188:18.50]Sorry.
[188:25.17]Well, I...
[188:28.36]Tell her it's like Netflix.
[188:32.26]What are you watching there?
[188:33.36]It's like Netflix.
[188:35.50]It's like Netflix.
[188:38.53]That's all you have to say.
[188:46.09]But, I mean, I'm always down to play with people that, you know, obviously like Vinny and Metallix, Joel, even like Star.
[188:55.19]It doesn't matter.
[188:56.55]It just, you know, depends on what they're doing, what people's schedules are, you know, what people want to do.
[189:04.68]Fight Joel again.
[189:10.60]Yeah, that's so funny how that just was... That was all talk from the both of us.
[189:14.78]It's hilarious.
[189:16.23]Oh, even Star!
[189:17.53]Yeah, you know, even Star.
[189:18.61]Hey, Multitrip, thanks for the $15.
[189:26.36]Silence Redditor.
[189:28.54]Oh, I forgot to do Bleed Purple, don't hit me.
[189:34.38]What?
[189:34.56]I'm not gonna... What are you talking about?
[189:35.72]Thanks for the... Oh, okay, I see.
[189:38.37]Thanks for the $15. $15.
[189:41.97]And thanks for the extra bonus bits there, too.
[189:45.17]Thank you.
[189:46.13]Multi-trip.
[189:46.87]Fifteen bucks.
[189:50.65]Also, HoHoKuma.
[189:53.68]HoHoKuma.
[189:55.14]Thanks for the ten dollars.
[189:57.42]Have you ever played Silent Hill 2, or would you consider doing a stream on it?
[190:01.70]First of all, thanks for the ten bucks.
[190:02.74]And yes, I've played through Silent Hill 2.
[190:04.69]Long time ago.
[190:06.89]And I have a...
[190:08.94]Kind of a rule on this channel, where if I've already played the game, especially if it's a single-player game,
[190:17.83]not on stream or in video format, I probably don't, I won't do it again.
[190:24.33]Because I like the idea of playing things and experiencing them for the first time with people here.
[190:34.31]And if I know what's going on, and I know what happens in the game, and I know what the major encounters are, it makes it almost, I'd rather not.
[190:43.99]I'd rather experience it for the first time.
[190:50.07]But I have played it.
[190:50.75]It is a classic.
[190:56.37]Explain Clocktower.
[190:58.81]Clocktower.
[191:01.47]I never played that Clocktower game before that stream.
[191:06.15]I just started and finished it in one stream.
[191:09.59]I forgot about that.
[191:20.17]But thank you, HohoKuma, for the $10.
[191:22.69]Appreciate it.
[191:23.91]SuperBruce, thanks for $5.
[191:24.83]Hey, Jerma, I'm going to be in Vegas for just a day for a business trip, and I need a recommendation where to eat.
[191:30.06]What's your favorite spot?
[191:31.06]Price is irrelevant.
[191:32.34]Hash House or GoGo in the link.
[191:36.74]That's my favorite restaurant in all of Las Vegas.
[191:39.60]Tority, right now, 10 community subs.
[191:42.49]Tority gave, I believe, 20 community subs earlier last night.
[191:48.57]Thank you so much, Tority.
[191:54.27]For your huge amount of community subs.
[191:58.31]It was Tority.
[191:59.21]There were at least 3 or 4 people that gave more than 10 or 20 last night.
[192:05.88]But... Yes, SuperBruce.
[192:10.82]The Bacchanal in Paris... Not Paris.
[192:13.56]In Caesar's Palace is insane.
[192:17.00]It's a buffet.
[192:18.70]It's one of the best buffets I've ever been to, the Bacchanal.
[192:21.74]Hash House A Go-Go is probably my favorite restaurant.
[192:28.73]There's no shortage of good food in Vegas, that's for sure.
[192:40.16]But, um, have fun in Vegas.
[192:46.16]Hopefully you... Oh, and if you go to Hash House or GoGo, you gotta get the blue cheese burger.
[192:50.58]The burger is the best thing on the... It's the best burger I've ever had in my life.
[192:54.14]It is the best hamburger you will ever eat.
[192:57.38]That is a German 985 guarantee.
[193:00.45]The blue cheese stuffed burger.
[193:02.65]There it is.
[193:05.85]Unless you hate blue cheese, which in that case, there's a couple other ones on the menu.
[193:12.09]Have I been to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant in Vegas?
[193:13.99]Yes, I've been to Gordon Ramsay's Steak once.
[193:16.60]And it was immensely expensive, but it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had.
[193:22.00]That's another great one.
[193:24.40]That one is in Paris.
[193:25.84]Gordon Ramsay's Steak in Paris is fantastic.
[193:27.88]Yes, that's the third one I would probably recommend.
[193:30.46]He's mentioned that price is irrelevant.
[193:33.62]Well, I hope that's the case, because if you go to Gordon Ramsay's Steak, you are going to do that thing where you open up the check and go, and then close it immediately and look around and be like, So be prepared for that.
[194:00.91]He's a cheap streamer.
[194:02.29]No, you ordered the two vodka tonics, right?
[194:05.25]I mean, I got a tea and it was like $2.50.
[194:09.59]Your three vodka tonics were like $45.
[194:16.26]So we split in there?
[194:17.42]Are we splitting the bill?
[194:18.22]You're just going to give me like cash?
[194:20.92]Or how does that work?
[194:21.94]I mean, mine was like $12.
[194:24.84]Yours was like $80.
[194:25.60]Are we just going to split in half?
[194:33.29]I think there's a whole entire Larry David segment of exactly what I'm describing.
[194:37.75]I think this is an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[194:40.48]I think it is.
[194:48.28]But, uh, have fun on your trip, Super Bruce.
[194:50.66]Hash, how's it go-go?
[194:51.54]Freudian weapon, thanks for the 250, Freudian.
[194:53.97]Since you don't call your mom for money, I'll send you some instead.
[194:56.69]Have a good night, sweetie.
[194:57.57]Thanks, Mom.
[195:01.41]Appreciate it, mom.
[195:03.11]That's my mom.
[195:03.73]Come on, guys.
[195:04.23]Let's do some Jerma hearts for mom.
[195:08.19]Jerma lied about 5k subs.
[195:11.57]Thanks for the 250.
[195:13.44]Your color's going to be piss brown tomorrow.
[195:16.24]Wait, what?
[195:18.16]What is this Jerma lied about 5,000 subs?
[195:24.38]What's this a reference to?
[195:37.53]5,000 gifted subs.
[195:39.45]Well, did I lie?
[195:40.32]I don't know.
[195:48.24]Did I lie?
[195:48.94]I don't know what I even lied about.
[195:59.23]Hold on.
[195:59.87]I got a video here from Effectator.
[196:01.35]I don't want to put it up.
[196:04.80]Sorry, I'm being like silent because I'm trying to see.
[196:09.24]What just happened to my stream labs?
[196:11.64]Oh, Dr. Steen comes in with five community subs.
[196:15.20]Thank you, Dr. Steen.
[196:19.98]Five more.
[196:21.89]Subs flying in.
[196:26.01]Uh, this is from Effectator.
[196:28.76]250 from a Vectator, and they say, finishing up the Hotline Miami 2 video felt contractually obligated to make this.
[196:36.68]PikaBanana5 community subs, back to back to back here.
[196:39.89]Thank you, PikaBanana.
[196:42.33]Let's see what this is.
[197:14.80]The window!
[197:21.72]Watch out for the wall!
[197:42.35]Jesus.
[197:44.27]Well, that was fucking awesome.
[197:45.33]Thank you, Effectator.
[197:52.75]That was the most intent... That was... Okay.
[197:54.99]Sekiro was really hard.
[197:58.49]And was really relentless.
[198:00.91]But I believe that Hotline Miami 2 may have been the hardest I've ever tried on stream in a video game.
[198:10.96]That is the most frustrated and annoyed and hardest I've probably ever tried on stream.
[198:22.45]Sekiro came close, but I was able to talk myself down in Sekiro.
[198:30.39]I was not able to give myself a chill-out talk at any point during Hotline Miami 2.
[198:37.24]It was just, I stepped on the gas and just went until the car turned off.
[198:49.42]I would recommend that game, though.
[198:51.88]Mario Tennis was blood-fueled.
[198:57.77]No, Simpsons Hit and Run was not... I was not getting angry at Simpsons Hit and Run.
[199:01.95]I was just going crazy.
[199:06.97]Blood-fueled.
[199:08.89]How do I feel about Mordhau?
[199:09.87]I think it's great.
[199:13.98]I think it's a really, really fun, funny, interesting...
[199:19.06]cool, gigantic battle simulator.
[199:20.68]It's awesome.
[199:25.13]But, thank you, Effectator, for that video.
[199:28.43]It was great.
[199:28.75]Thanks for the $2.52.
[199:29.73]Thank you, Multitrip for the $5.
[199:31.27]Congrats on top-fragging in a pub.
[199:36.05]I'm not sure if, uh... I'm not sure if that's supposed to be mean.
[199:40.29]Is that like a... Is that a... Is that... That's not... Because some people might be like, Hey, congratulations on top-fragging in a pub.
[199:47.21]You know?
[199:47.75]But there's no space there.
[199:48.51]There's no dash.
[199:50.61]Okay, now this is actual... This is actual praise, because it's just congrats on topfragging in a pub.
[199:57.44]What I'm describing would be congrats on topfragging dot dot dot dot in a pub.
[200:03.52]So this is a good... That's a compliment.
[200:05.00]Thank you.
[200:05.92]Appreciate that.
[200:06.44]Thanks for the five dollars, too.
[200:10.84]Uh, thank you, Rain, for the three dollars.
[200:13.96]Jerma is getting Kingdom Come flashbacks.
[200:16.06]No, no.
[200:19.66]I was just having fun.
[200:24.98]Captain Worgen, thanks for the $4.
[200:26.54]Hey Jerma, cool to see you getting into Mordhau.
[200:28.75]I haven't been able to catch these streams in a while, and there are too many new VODs for me to catch up on.
[200:32.87]You need to control your streaming addiction.
[200:37.41]Well, I mean, a lot of that has to do with I've streamed five times this week.
[200:42.60]I've streamed, what, five of the last six days?
[200:44.26]Five of the last seven days?
[200:45.32]I don't usually do that.
[200:47.62]And some of them have been long.
[200:50.03]I typically only stream four-ish, four times a week.
[200:54.14]Three, four times a week.
[200:56.98]So I have streamed a lot in the last five days, six days.
[201:02.98]Maybe that's why.
[201:05.78]But I was gone for a long time, so I kind of want to make up for it.
[201:17.44]But I don't really plan that, it just kind of... You know, if I feel like going, five days, four, five, six days, whatever.
[201:25.27]Do I have a date for season two of Sam & Max?
[201:26.87]Yes, Friday.
[201:29.91]We'll do Sam & Max season two, at least the first probably couple, two or three episodes maybe, on Friday night.
[201:42.73]Dreams will be on Wednesday.
[201:44.51]Thursday's a mystery stream.
[201:46.51]Could be anything.
[201:47.56]I wouldn't miss it.
[201:48.14]Could be anything.
[201:51.06]And then Friday, we'll do Sam & Max.
[201:52.20]And then we'll take Saturday off.
[201:55.80]And we'll be back on Sunday for something.
[201:59.69]So we'll do two days off here, three days on, one day off, one day on.
[202:05.65]That'll complete the week there.
[202:12.16]World of Warcraft?
[202:13.48]Hmm... You know how I considered for a second just doing a community World of Warcraft classic, just be dickheads and just run around together and take over servers?
[202:28.15]But I would only really want to do that if it was... if we could separate ourselves.
[202:34.05]Because I really don't want to fuck up somebody else's game.
[202:36.60]If we can find some low population server that nobody's on, and just start at zero, and try to get to Molten Core with 40 people, and only the strong survive, you know what I mean?
[202:51.98]Like, if you... We've got to come up with 40 people to do Molten Core.
[202:58.11]And if we don't beat Molten Core every time we wipe...
[203:02.86]Something happens.
[203:03.38]I don't know.
[203:03.74]We have to beat Molten Core with viewers only.
[203:07.81]Somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[203:09.37]By the way, that is probably impossible.
[203:12.37]What I just described is not even remotely completable.
[203:17.45]Maybe we can do it, though.
[203:18.19]It might be fun.
[203:19.27]Torati, on top of the massive community subs, gave 50 bucks.
[203:26.17]Thank you so much.
[203:28.93]$50.
[203:29.15]And just want to say you're my favorite streamer and savior of my rough college days.
[203:33.49]I've been gifting subs from time to time and will continue to support you and this amazing community.
[203:37.79]Keep up the amazing work, Jerma.
[203:39.42]We'll all be supporting your future works.
[203:43.16]Thank you.
[203:47.12]I'm so fucking happy to hear that you think this is an amazing community.
[203:52.92]That you think it's a great place to be.
[203:57.55]Sorry about your rough college time.
[204:04.91]I am honored to be your favorite streamer.
[204:06.59]Thank you for the $50.
[204:07.65]Thank you for the hundreds of other dollars you've given with community subs.
[204:14.33]Thank you.
[204:18.75]And from that, we're going to be moving to... Sly161 for $2.50.
[204:27.34]Yeah, here's my one issue with making a server.
[204:41.72]The same kind of thing happened to the TF2 server that I ran years and years and years ago.
[204:46.46]I just wasn't around to manage it.
[204:49.18]And... You get admins and mods and... Sometimes... It's almost like you build it, you make it, and you have it just open.
[204:58.15]And then if there's ever a problem or something, it comes back to me and they're like, Hey, something's going on in the server!
[205:02.81]And I'm like, oh, fuck the server, right?
[205:04.47]Okay, let me... I gotta get in contact with an admin and... Honestly, it would probably be one of those scenarios...
[205:11.35]where if I were to do something like that, I would just pay for the server, and it would just be like, I would hand that off completely to just somebody in the community.
[205:23.53]A handful of people that really wanted to do that, and I would just pay for it.
[205:26.79]And it would be a community-run server that I was essentially just keeping turned on.
[205:35.70]Because it's just hard to be that guy that gets the message like, Hey, there's a hacker in your server and he's like spamming fucking ear blast music.
[205:46.35]And it's like, oh, okay, let me go into console.
[205:53.68]It's hard to manage that.
[205:55.28]And I'd rather just have somebody in the community take that over completely.
[206:08.43]But it's an interesting idea.
[206:10.69]Maybe I'll talk to some of the mods about it and we'll see if anybody would be interested.
[206:16.58]If anybody likes the game or something, maybe.
[206:21.53]But I do miss that aspect of just being able to jump into my server, and it's just, there's my server, and I always know I have a spot on it, and there'll be people in it.
[206:34.82]That was a pretty cool thing.
[206:36.44]A lot of the videos on TF2, I mean, maybe some of you people that are new to the channel recently in the last year or two,
[206:43.82]But a lot of those TF2 videos that required like 30 people to do something weird were done on my server.
[206:52.38]And people lining up and listening to the things that I was telling them to do.
[206:58.05]So, it was a lot of fun to have that opportunity to do it.
[207:08.85]But moving on from that, Multitrip, thanks for the $9, Multitrip.
[207:14.26]And he says, Opa Gangnam Style.
[207:21.02]Those are the people who, you know, know you from the servers.
[207:26.03]Thank you, Multitrip, for the $9.
[207:26.89]I think Gangnam Style is a dance in the game, right?
[207:35.12]Thank you for the $9, Multitrip.
[207:37.41]Pastaglobs, thanks for the 250.
[207:38.87]Haha, manual blinking and breathing.
[207:40.83]What?
[207:44.65]What is it?
[207:44.93]What is that?
[207:47.19]Manual blinking and breathing?
[207:51.72]Just blinking?
[207:59.16]Fuck you.
[207:59.60]Fuck you.
[207:59.92]What's going on?
[208:08.79]Oh.
[208:10.17]It's to force you to think about your blinking and breathing.
[208:13.79]He's too dumb to get it.
[208:14.73]He's immune.
[208:17.11]Did it just bounce off me?
[208:19.17]Good.
[208:23.13]Uh, Gutsy, thanks for the $3.12, Gutsy.
[208:25.91]Sorry for Pan, but this game is a lot of fun, Jermajex.
[208:31.04]I did have like three or four Pan guys coming after me.
[208:39.86]There was at least three.
[208:43.20]They were like in the back of the crowd just throwing pans over.
[208:45.98]They were lining me up in their sights.
[208:49.41]Just trying to hit me in the head with a pan.
[208:56.43]I was being pan harassed.
[208:58.45]Reminded me of the Brutpack TF2 flashbacks.
[209:01.50]Remember that?
[209:15.75]I miss that noise.
[209:16.72]Do you really?
[209:17.90]Do you actually miss that noise?
[209:25.24]You'll hear that sound again and go, hello, and pull the headphones off.
[209:34.61]But thank you, Gutsy, for the $3.12.
[209:35.67]And thanks for playing.
[209:39.29]I'm glad you had fun.
[209:46.43]Anyway, I made this and I want you to hear it.
[209:49.63]I made this.
[209:50.11]What is this?
[210:16.30]This is a jebaited thing.
[210:23.40]Is that the new thing now people are doing?
[210:37.45]These are all just versions of Rickroll and the Gnome.
[210:51.86]That's We Like to Party, yes, by the Vengaboys.
[210:58.15]Right.
[211:01.51]But thank you, Tingy.
[211:02.49]Hopefully you and your friend have a good time.
[211:06.07]PikaBanana250 from PikaBanana.
[211:08.11]Thank you, PikaBanana.
[211:09.48]And for the community subs.
[211:12.08]And speaking of those subs, what the hell do you say we don't just put them on the screen right now?
[211:17.70]Let's see them.
[211:19.56]Here they come.
[211:23.05]all the subscribers I still have the what color am I thing and green is still winning what is it now I refresh it yeah green thank you to all of you again for continuing to sub and support this channel you are the oil that keeps the fire burning
[211:53.31]Thank you again.
[211:58.87]And there's been a couple more came in.
[212:02.91]Again, we had the $50 from Tora Tea.
[212:04.57]Thank you.
[212:06.11]Jerma lied and... What is this?
[212:08.91]Jerma lied and didn't draw sticks.
[212:12.21]Thanks for the $2.50.
[212:12.87]I don't even know what half of these are references to.
[212:18.85]Wait, I was supposed to draw somebody's fursona.
[212:23.20]Oh.
[212:25.08]I didn't lie, I forgot.
[212:26.36]You need to replace these.
[212:28.06]It's not Jerma lied about X, it's Jerma forgot about X. Half of these would not be, they'd be forgets.
[212:37.75]Jerma forgot about Ace Attorney.
[212:41.23]Forgot does not mean you lied.
[212:42.75]Lying implies there was intent and malice behind it.
[212:48.57]Lie is intent, forget is you don't remember.
[212:58.27]I did not intentionally forget.
[213:07.56]You intended not to remember.
[213:10.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[213:18.22]Anyways, they say... I've seen it.
[213:19.53]Never played it.
[213:27.82]I've never played it.
[213:29.50]That's a kind of a side-scrolling Contra-like shooter, right?
[213:35.38]Looks pretty cool.
[213:40.40]Not in the plans.
[213:43.66]Not in the plans at the moment.
[213:48.52]I should do something with Stur.
[213:49.50]Yeah, I gotta hit up Stur, see what he's up to.
[213:51.50]It's been a while.
[213:52.78]The last thing I remember is he rage quit VR, right?
[213:58.54]No.
[213:59.78]Am I misremembering?
[214:01.00]Am I lying about this story?
[214:02.58]Am I forgetting this story?
[214:04.36]Which one is it?
[214:08.96]But I think you have, Gunn, for the 250.
[214:10.14]I have a secret task.
[214:11.75]You mustn't tell anyone.
[214:12.61]Seriously, though, Jerma, I really enjoyed your Kingdom Come streams, and I feel that your medieval game streams result in some memorable, memorable material.
[214:21.03]A loot guy for Jerma Rumble.
[214:24.64]Maybe.
[214:24.76]Maybe.
[214:25.97]We have a lot of characters that... That might happen sooner than you think.
[214:30.87]I might have to put that together soon.
[214:32.85]We've got a lot... It's been... How was it?
[214:34.11]Like, it's been four... Four, six, five months?
[214:37.77]I've only done one since being in Vegas, right?
[214:43.28]It's been about six and a half, seven months since moving to Vegas.
[214:47.58]We've done one, but maybe... Yeah, I think we're getting to that... Once every six months kind of thing here.
[214:55.03]We got plenty of new characters.
[214:58.89]Yeah, it's been... I've been in Vegas since October of last year.
[215:03.41]Time is blazing by.
[215:04.69]It's crazy.
[215:14.25]The Thursday stream is not the Rumble.
[215:16.65]That's... It takes like a week to put those together.
[215:23.23]It's like, that's probably like three to five days of making characters and figuring out what I want to do.
[215:27.97]That's not going to happen in two days.
[215:36.89]Wednesday is Dreams.
[215:38.04]Thursday is Mystery Stream.
[215:40.24]Friday is Sam & Max Season 2.
[215:44.08]That's the tentative schedule here.
[215:47.98]But, uh, thank you... Thank you to, uh, Nagel...
[215:55.13]For the 250.
[215:57.61]Will you go to KFC with me right now?
[216:01.52]I'm not going to be able to make it.
[216:06.46]Even if you told me where it was.
[216:07.44]And I knew exactly where it was.
[216:10.24]And I wouldn't be able to get there in time.
[216:15.40]Just get an extra chicken wing for me.
[216:18.29]And then eat it.
[216:18.79]And pretend you're me eating it.
[216:20.73]And say like a catchphrase.
[216:21.71]You know what I mean?
[216:22.21]Be like.
[216:24.51]SHME!
[216:25.13]And then take another bite.
[216:26.77]Just pretend you're me for, like, a minute.
[216:30.25]Yeah, just pretend you're me and then lie.
[216:32.51]Lie to somebody.
[216:33.05]Like, after you take a bite of that chicken wing, just, like, go to the nearest person in your house and lie to them.
[216:41.10]All right.
[216:41.62]Dr. Steen, $5 coming in.
[216:43.34]Play Overcooked 2 with housemates on stream.
[216:45.72]It's worth it.
[216:46.16]I already did.
[216:48.66]Thanks for entertaining us all these years.
[216:50.10]We love you.
[216:50.88]And they say it's a sweat check.
[216:54.35]I'm doing just fine.
[216:56.09]Me and Italics did play Overcooked 2 already on stream.
[217:00.58]Remember?
[217:03.00]Yeah.
[217:04.74]Me and Italics already did that, yeah.
[217:06.76]Come on, you gotta keep up with the lore here!
[217:14.86]Alright, that's my time.
[217:16.68]I'll see you guys soon.
[217:18.70]On Wednesday.
[217:19.46]Take care of yourselves.
[217:20.82]We're gonna do some dreams.
[217:21.96]Hopefully I have something interesting to show.
[217:24.50]Hopefully I have something fun to do.
[217:28.59]See you very soon.
[217:29.31]Have a great rest of your early part of your week.
[217:32.53]See you in a couple days.
[217:35.59]Wednesday.
[217:36.55]Good night.
[217:36.93]Good luck.
[217:38.13]Take care, everybody.
[217:38.73]See you soon.
[217:40.51]And goodbye.
[217:50.88]I can't do stream legends.
[217:53.56]I'm sorry.
[217:53.98]This hasn't been 24 hours.
[217:59.94]I streamed yesterday into this morning.
[218:03.40]I cannot do stream legends.
[218:06.66]Alright, goodbye!
