[00:08.42]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:09.91]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.83]And tonight, gonna be playing as the Huntsman Sniper with the Huntsman, the Crush the Spy in the face, baby.
[00:20.15]The Huntsman, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Bushwacker.
[00:24.89]Now, I take the Bushwacker off because, honestly, it's there for no reason.
[00:28.91]Pretty sure I swap it out with the default Kukri in a minute here after my second or third death.
[00:34.24]And speaking of deaths...
[00:36.74]This gameplay is crazy.
[00:39.00]Take a look at the number right now on the top of the screen.
[00:41.52]After, of course, you take a look at me shooting that scout right in his teeth with an arrow.
[00:45.61]But there's a minute and 25 seconds left.
[00:48.17]I was in a Skype call.
[00:49.17]Me, Boo, and Stealth were all in a Skype call.
[00:52.07]We were just raging at each other this whole time.
[00:54.49]You don't even understand.
[00:55.31]They had us spawn camped the entire time.
[00:58.05]And the round before this, they were absolutely rolling us and dominating us.
[01:02.76]So we were just in the Skype call going, like: This is bullshit, I'm so- this is ridiculous. Oh, spy, look out for the-
[01:08.40]And it was just crazy, and then watch what happens here.
[01:13.15]The mood in the Skype call went from, oh my god, we're going to hang ourselves depressed, to the most joyous, amazing occasion.
[01:22.12]Like, really.
[01:23.72]Because we've all been in this situation before.
[01:26.26]I know I don't speak for myself.
[01:28.18]When you get on Team Fortress 2, you want to play, you want to have fun with your friends, and every single round you get into, you happen to get on the team that is the unbalanced team, and you lose every single match.
[01:39.70]That is exactly what was happening to us in this string of games we played.
[01:44.00]I think we did maybe three or four in a row where we were on the unbalanced team and we got rolled within two minutes of the game starting.
[01:50.00]Also, right there, does that happen to anybody else?
[01:53.00]My mouse- my optical mouse will sometimes just freak out and just move around in random directions.
[01:58.00]I want to know if anybody else has that problem.
[02:01.00]But take a look at what just happened, overtime right now.
[02:03.00]Getting on the cart as the Huntsman sniper, I got a heavy with me now.
[02:08.31]We actually kept this point.
[02:10.72]And from here on out, it is a total roll.
[02:14.22]We absolutely destroy them in a way that I can't even really comprehend.
[02:19.22]And I think I die only one more time after this right here.
[02:23.50]And it really was just crazy.
[02:25.31]Nobody really expected this to happen.
[02:26.97]We were in the Skype call, like I said, just in shock.
[02:30.35]I kept on landing these shots, getting, you'll see, I get some really, really amazing Huntsman shots coming up here.
[02:35.78]And we were just stunned.
[02:37.22]It's like, wait, wait, wait, this team was just totally dominating us.
[02:40.84]They were destroying us the whole time.
[02:42.96]What just happened?
[02:44.18]Why are we winning now?
[02:45.91]I guess it's just the nature of the Team Fortress 2 beast in parentheses quotations right there or whatever you want to call them.
[02:53.57]I think because this game is just so ridiculous, there's so many variables, anything can happen.
[02:59.03]So as you saw with one second to go being spawn camped the whole time, we managed to still cap the point and we're still going.
[03:07.41]I believe this is the only time the cart stands still
[03:11.93]for more than one second without moving.
[03:14.58]After we get it through the middle of this tunnel here, the next time it stops is at the last point.
[03:21.48]And while I have a minute or so here while we roll the cart, I want to talk about an update for you guys on the model search.
[03:29.76]The search for a CGI model maker or something, however you want to phrase it.
[03:34.29]But before I get into any of that, I want to say thank you so much to all of you guys.
[03:38.99]Everybody that sent me a PM or that sent me a comment telling me a certain modeler,
[03:43.55]or even if you offer it up to do the service yourself.
[03:46.33]I really appreciate it, guys.
[03:47.78]I got a great response.
[03:48.88]Thank you all so, so, so much.
[03:51.04]But I think I've narrowed it down now.
[03:52.76]I think I've got the guy I'm going to try and contact.
[03:55.71]Hopefully I can make some kind of arrangement with this person, because I don't want it to be like...
[04:02.37]Like, I wanted to benefit them as much as it would benefit me as well, so just wanted to make the update that I no longer need any modeler names or any community names or anything like that, because I think I got the guy.
[04:16.44]But thank you everybody regardless, like I said, if I ever need anybody in the future, I will definitely make another video asking for it.
[04:25.22]So let's talk about the gameplay again here.
[04:26.90]Look at this pyro.
[04:28.14]This pyro was so laggy, I couldn't even hit him point blank.
[04:31.95]The amount of lag that was being generated from that guy's bloodstream was off the charts.
[04:37.70]And look at that guy.
[04:38.42]You see that guy fall off the edge?
[04:41.36]I always love when that happens.
[04:42.98]And let's talk about Upward now.
[04:45.28]Speaking of like falling off the edges and Upward being a crazy map, this is a pretty difficult map to get a gameplay on.
[04:52.02]As you've probably noticed by now, there's only maybe two or three Upward gameplays, including this one on my channel.
[04:59.31]And that's really just because it's so long.
[05:02.17]If you do not roll on Upward, or even Badwater to be honest,
[05:06.51]If you don't abso-freaking-lutely roll the other team, or when you're on defense, if you don't defend the point really well, you're going to end up with like a 45 minute round.
[05:17.38]And this happens quite frequently.
[05:19.70]I spend at least 20 minutes, 25 minutes at least, in most of my bad water or upward rounds.
[05:25.98]So it can be quite tricky sometimes to get an actual gameplay that is watchable, because like you guys know, I don't like uploading like 27 minute long videos, only because it kills my internet, and my computer will just explode if I try and render out like a 30 minute video.
[05:42.08]I did that one time before, and it was for a Q&A video, and my computer like exploded.
[05:47.72]So I don't want to do that again.
[05:50.65]So coming up to the end of the gameplay here, a Demoman takes out the Sentry that's at the top left.
[05:55.49]I get Kritzkrieg'd for, I think, one second, and I end up getting a Kritzkrieg kill with the Huntsman.
[06:00.67]And it was just pure luck.
[06:02.35]One second he had it on me, and I got the kill with it.
[06:05.18]And I still can't believe we came back from such a huge deficit.
[06:09.38]Because, I mean, we were down to one second at the first point, and less than five or six minutes later, we win the game.
[06:15.78]That is just unbelievable to me.
[06:17.68]And I give a huge standing ovation to my teammates.
[06:20.43]We were in Skype saying, oh my god, this is great.
[06:23.05]What an awesome comeback.
[06:24.67]And it really was.
[06:25.83]So thank you guys so much for watching.
[06:27.77]I really do appreciate it.
[06:29.29]And I will see you guys all next time.
[06:31.13]So take care, everybody.
