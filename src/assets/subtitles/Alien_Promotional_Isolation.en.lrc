[00:05.51]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:07.55]Jerma here with Alien Isolation.
[00:10.66]This is a brand new Steam game that came out a couple days ago.
[00:14.90]And it's a horror game survival where you survive the alien.
[00:20.66]Yes, it is.
[00:22.52]I'm Ripley's, uh, Ripley's, believe it or not, daughter.
[00:25.46]Believe it or not.
[00:28.64]So, I guess you need to explore in this game.
[00:31.16]There was a crash.
[00:32.18]Oh, no.
[00:33.36]I need to investigate the mystery of the crash.
[00:36.30]Which is what I plan on doing.
[00:38.12]Let's go ahead and go... Oh, fuck.
[00:43.18]That's him.
[00:44.22]Can I get away without him seeing?
[00:45.34]That's the main thing that's gotta be... No, no, no!
[00:48.00]He's right behind me!
[00:48.74]He's right behind me!
[00:49.26]Oh, my God!
[00:49.66]Oh, my God!
[00:49.92]Oh, my God!
[00:50.80]If I can make it up these stairs, please!
[00:53.42]It's an alien!
[00:54.86]It's a fucking alien!
[00:56.14]I... Where is he?
[00:59.38]Where'd he go?
[01:02.71]The doors are all locked.
[01:04.39]I'm trapped in this spooky game.
[01:06.03]What do I do?
[01:06.57]Oh, I guess I could climb in here.
[01:09.44]Turn my flashlight on.
[01:11.70]An achievement.
[01:12.40]Nice.
[01:12.70]You know, I love getting achievements.
[01:14.14]Especially when... There he is.
[01:16.18]There he is again.
[01:16.66]He's in the vent.
[01:17.40]He's in the vent.
[01:17.96]He's in the vent.
[01:18.38]Get out of the vent.
[01:19.44]Out of the vent.
[01:19.94]Down the stairs.
[01:20.95]Through the metal detectors.
[01:21.91]Hopefully I don't have any weapons.
[01:24.23]Okay.
[01:24.49]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[01:26.17]Straight down.
[01:26.67]Straight down.
[01:27.07]Straight down the stairs.
[01:29.53]Come on.
[01:29.73]Come on.
[01:29.91]Come on.
[01:30.09]Come on.
[01:30.33]I know you can hide.
[01:31.55]Hide in here.
[01:33.21]Open it.
[01:34.36]Okay.
[01:36.64]Shh.
[01:36.78]Quiet in here.
[01:37.44]I don't want to... If I make any noise, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[01:40.98]God, there he is.
[01:42.64]Oh, please don't come in here and kill me.
[01:45.39]What the fuck is he doing?
[01:46.87]He's eating chicken.
[01:49.21]That's psycho.
[01:50.75]He's eating chicken for... He's eating chicken for God's sakes.
[01:53.53]Time to go.
[01:54.01]Time to go.
[01:54.37]Get out.
[01:54.55]Get out.
[01:54.75]Get out.
[01:56.43]I'm going to go this way.
[01:57.11]Up to the right.
[01:58.36]I think I'm in the clear.
[02:00.20]Pretty sure I'm in the clear right now.
[02:02.86]I don't know though.
[02:04.51]It's got a food item.
[02:05.47]He's got another food item.
[02:06.25]He's got ham now.
[02:07.58]What is this guy?
[02:08.04]Chicken, ham, drinks.
[02:09.52]What has he got?
[02:09.92]Everything?
[02:11.02]I'm gonna hide in this corner here.
[02:11.94]I remember seeing the tutorial, the tutorial said hide in a corner and he might not be able to see you.
[02:16.78]So I'm gonna take his advice and... Here he is.
[02:21.02]He's just conga-ing right now.
[02:23.68]Which is a bad sign because they conga when they're very happy.
[02:26.22]Aliens will do that.
[02:27.14]He must have just gotten a kill on a soldier in the top there.
[02:30.06]I just don't want him to come this way.
[02:31.88]Thank God he's a brainless fuck and he went the other way.
[02:34.68]Don't know how he did not see me.
[02:36.17]It's bright out here.
[02:38.11]But I need to be careful.
[02:39.93]Because if he is going to pop at me again and hit me, I don't want that to happen.
[02:44.25]No, no, no, no.
[02:45.47]Okay, okay.
[02:45.93]There he is.
[02:46.21]There he is.
[02:46.47]That was weird.
[02:48.47]You know, hold on.
[02:49.13]He doesn't even know I'm here.
[02:51.21]Can I just bash this guy's fucking head in?
[02:54.16]I just beat the game.
[02:56.22]I just beat the game.
[02:58.02]I just beat Alien Isolation.
