[00:02.37]Oh, God.
[00:03.15]Oh, dear God.
[00:04.03]Let me let me open this game.
[00:08.45]See if I can do it.
[00:09.97]It's called I think it's called Super Psycho Psycho Baseball or something.
[00:13.51]Let's see.
[00:18.74]MVP Baseball 2005.
[00:19.56]Well, that's actually the greatest baseball game ever made, so.
[00:26.94]You know what sucks about that?
[00:29.79]Do you guys remember?
[00:31.49]So MVP Baseball was the best baseball game that's ever been made.
[00:36.29]And then 2K sniped the rights to all of baseball and they couldn't make it anymore.
[00:45.01]few years later, they made an NCAA version of the game, which was still amazing.
[00:49.22]It was still really good.
[00:50.90]But they couldn't make baseball games anymore because there was a feud where, if you remember, EA made MVP Baseball.
[00:58.85]EA also makes Madden.
[01:00.47]And they got the exclusive rights to football.
[01:03.62]nobody else could make a an officially licensed football game right unless you were first party so right third I believe third party game uh developers couldn't make them so I think that 2k was like hey fine you want you want football we'll buy the rights to baseball I remember being very very sad because I actually did not like madden at all
[01:29.32]I liked the EA baseball games, not the EA football games.
[01:33.55]And I would much rather they did it reverse and just bought, you know, the rights to it.
[01:40.49]For the baseball games instead of football.
[01:42.09]But Madden is way more popular than MVP ever was.
[01:48.40]What was it?
[01:48.98]What game were we playing?
[01:49.74]Oh, yeah, right.
[01:52.37]This is called Super Psycho Baseball.
[01:55.69]This has been recommended a few times in the recommended Discord.
[01:58.29]By the way, if you don't know, the Discord has a recommended channel.
[02:03.78]I look at it all the time, and here's proof.
[02:05.86]I think I need to capture it a different way.
[02:15.08]Let's see.
[02:23.35]There we go.
[02:32.79]Alright, so I don't know.
[02:36.00]Let's give it a try.
[02:38.92]Can one of the mods change the title?
[02:40.90]Hey there.
[02:48.88]Nice to see you again.
[02:50.20]You lost the game?
[02:51.74]Figures.
[02:53.82]I haven't even played.
[02:56.12]What?
[02:58.04]How do I hit?
[03:00.45]Why am I so small?
[03:02.95]How do I hit the baseball?
[03:07.40]Oh, I have HP?
[03:24.14]That's got to be out.
[03:26.04]God damn it.
[03:29.97]How do you hit a home run?
[03:36.65]I'm going to lose.
[03:37.45]I don't even know how to play.
[03:40.61]You got to get just under it.
[03:44.95]That's gone.
[03:46.13]Gone.
[03:48.66]Good.
[03:48.98]Alright.
[03:49.32]I get it.
[03:49.62]I get it.
[03:49.86]I understand.
[03:50.26]I understand.
[03:50.98]Let's go.
[03:53.02]Gone.
[03:53.68]Gone.
[03:56.01]Now that could dinger.
[04:02.39]Gone.
[04:04.29]Three in a row.
[04:11.64]Gone.
[04:13.42]Four in a row.
[04:21.25]That's how you come back and you win.
[04:23.31]Five in a row.
[04:25.09]At the very last out.
[04:28.09]Unbelievable.
[04:29.15]Alright, first inning.
[04:34.03]Do I still have only 10 HP?
[04:35.25]Whoa, hold on.
[04:35.92]112 coins.
[04:39.53]Heal 20 HP.
[04:42.16]Devil's Pact.
[04:43.02]Sell your soul.
[04:44.00]Regain 5% of your max HP with every home run.
[04:48.26]Nerd Glasses.
[04:49.74]You put on a pair of specs.
[04:51.22]Increases range of a perfect hit.
[04:54.57]You have an even bigger heart.
[04:55.77]You might want to see a doctor, but HP is max HP by 30.
[04:58.85]I mean, I think it's the Nerd Glasses, right?
[05:05.74]How much do I have?
[05:06.62]I need to heal.
[05:09.06]You only get to pick one.
[05:10.94]He's throwing a lot faster now, but I think that's still gone.
[05:16.28]He's throwing so fast.
[05:18.00]I picked the shittiest upgrade.
[05:20.64]That's gone.
[05:23.70]Get out!
[05:24.22]It's alright.
[05:42.84]So I... Whatever.
[05:47.23]You get that first time somebody plays?
[05:54.93]You're supposed to say, hey, try again.
[05:58.20]That was the tutorial.
[05:59.34]Now you know how to play.
[06:00.20]So now don't click one power-up.
[06:03.74]Alright, let's go.
[06:05.18]I got it.
[06:10.81]I understand how it works.
[06:11.57]I'm going for it now.
[06:14.93]Sorry if I hit you.
[06:15.87]I've had a bad day.
[06:22.89]Play ball.
[06:25.85]Started off good.
[06:27.26]Goodbye baseball.
[06:35.48]Goodbye baseball.
[06:41.87]You gotta get just under it.
[06:51.40]That's good enough, right?
[06:53.94]Alright.
[06:54.82]Good start.
[07:00.58]Shit.
[07:00.86]It's okay.
[07:07.20]Alright.
[07:08.19]I got plenty of health.
[07:09.71]Let me not waste this.
[07:11.14]That's one inning down.
[07:12.44]Two to go.
[07:17.91]Okay.
[07:19.35]Your bat grows in size.
[07:20.51]Hitbox size.
[07:21.31]I kind of want that.
[07:23.71]More HP.
[07:24.55]You know what it is.
[07:25.27]Power boosted.
[07:27.09]I think I might go for the power.
[07:28.75]Should I take the steroids?
[07:33.80]Alright.
[07:34.76]Go ahead.
[07:35.44]Call me a one-pitch Andy.
[07:42.26]No, this is gonna work.
[07:43.44]This is gonna work pretty well.
[07:46.06]One-pitch Andy.
[07:48.78]Don't get over it.
[07:55.14]Alright.
[08:08.84]Jesus!
[08:10.80]That's enough, I think.
[08:12.77]Here we go.
[08:13.19]Alright, what am I buying next?
[08:20.93]Alright, steroids two.
[08:21.55]I don't have enough.
[08:22.01]Should I hold it?
[08:41.35]I think I buy this and hold this one.
[08:42.81]Because I'll get this next.
[08:52.27]What does that mean?
[08:53.31]No fucking way.
[08:54.25]It's literally impossible.
[09:12.88]Come on, get out!
[09:15.42]Home run!
[09:16.60]Home run!
[09:29.67]Come on, up!
[09:37.91]That's a moonshot!
[09:49.95]One more.
[09:50.27]We have raid?
[09:53.20]Hold on, hold on.
[09:55.86]Oh my goodness.
[09:59.92]No, no, no, no, no.
[10:01.50]Not in the last pitch.
[10:04.18]Thank God I fucking actually nailed it.
[10:07.70]We're like... You... You completed.
[10:11.82]You advance.
[10:12.30]I advance?
[10:20.27]Wait, like three raids come in.
[10:24.31]Bruce Green, Sideshow, and Bren.
[10:30.19]What's up?
[10:34.09]Thanks a lot, guys.
[10:35.41]Thanks, everybody.
[10:38.48]Welcome to the channel.
[10:39.22]We're playing this baseball game.
[10:41.30]It's pretty cool.
[10:44.04]It's called Super Psycho Baseball.
[10:45.32]Hope you had good streams.
[10:48.10]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[10:51.76]Raid song?
[10:52.44]We don't do raid songs.
[10:56.78]Alright, I'm definitely doing steroids, though.
[10:59.58]Hope you guys are fans of baseball.
[11:05.17]Or should I be conservative here?
[11:07.21]I feel like this is a big deal.
[11:18.39]Uh...
[11:22.38]so many of my brothers chopped to pieces there is no god I only have 10 HP adios baseball that was up now you too have experienced loss they make super psycho

[11:53.88]Shit.
[11:54.32]Alright.
[11:54.68]Oh, come on!
[11:55.56]That was perfect!
[12:02.39]It's outta here!
[12:21.91]So I need to do accuracy.
[12:24.57]I think it's more important.
[12:26.67]Rogue like baseball.
[12:51.35]How did I swing through that?
[12:56.31]I lost it.
[12:57.09]I'm playing really poorly now.
[13:01.45]Oh, come on.
[13:06.90]Come on!
[13:07.48]Restart.
[13:18.61]Hey, my name's Pitchy, and I got a hell of a fastball.
[13:25.30]Keep your eye on the ball.
[13:26.32]I'm trying.
[13:37.93]Good bye baseball!
[13:43.85]You got all of that one.
[13:45.63]Perfect.
[13:46.31]Hit.
[13:48.12]That's a moonshot.
[13:49.42]I don't remember the 20 coins.
[13:54.22]Three in a row.
[14:05.67]Four in a row.
[14:12.63]Okay, next inning.
[14:15.36]Count it.
[14:16.04]Five in a row.
[14:17.27]How did I get more coins for less distance?
[14:20.23]That's one inning down.
[14:21.53]Two to go.
[14:22.49]Alright.
[14:26.31]Can you talk a little louder?
[14:27.33]Vinny's stream is a little loud right now.
[14:32.69]What are you doing?
[14:36.59]What are you doing?
[14:37.33]5% does not sound like... It's not very much.
[14:55.50]These two are effectively the same power-up.
[14:58.34]Technically, right?
[15:05.49]I'll go ahead and tip you my next pitch.
[15:07.43]It's a fastball.
[15:12.21]That makes six in a row!
[15:13.65]I need health.
[15:19.70]That was a really hard pitch to hit, and I didn't get under it enough.
[15:29.62]Goodbye baseball.
[15:31.90]It's out of here.
[15:43.79]That's enough.
[15:47.41]Three in a row.
[15:59.54]Alright, I've got 70%.
[16:00.92]Breath of the Wild?
[16:06.57]I don't have my Switch set up over here.
[16:14.57]Um... It's definitely this one.
[16:18.30]I need the health.
[16:22.50]5% HP every time you hit a home run.
[16:24.00]Psycho mode activated.
[16:28.41]It's the final inning and I'm all oiled up.
[16:31.03]Let's go.
[16:40.08]Enough.
[16:43.20]It's out of here.
[16:49.25]That's gotta be enough, yep.
[16:51.75]Home run.
[16:58.69]That pitch was so... This game is hard.
[17:12.62]That wasn't even in the strike zone.
[17:15.94]It's out of here.
[17:30.75]There you go.
[17:31.11]Alright.
[17:32.35]Next thing.
[17:32.95]Next.
[17:33.19]You're just bad?
[17:33.85]Move the camera to the top right?
[17:36.95]Hold on.
[17:37.23]It's this.
[17:37.57]Right?
[17:37.79]Big bat?
[18:02.32]That's 10 health every time I hit a home run.
[18:06.66]But this means I'll hit more home runs.
[18:10.12]I'm going for this.
[18:12.34]Alright, come on.
[18:14.62]This tree throws curveballs.
[18:16.46]Alright, just zone in.
[18:21.95]Lock in and go for it.
[18:25.81]That's so fucked up.
[18:32.62]Goodbye Baseball Give me the health Hit the pole Goodbye Baseball
[19:01.11]Thank God for the heal.
[19:01.83]Alright, now we're working.
[19:11.23]Okay, inning two.
[19:32.43]How did that not go out?
[19:33.21]Alright.
[19:45.60]Good.
[19:47.45]I have to hit two or three home runs right in a row.
[19:48.95]That's one inning down.
[19:50.21]Two to go.
[20:02.96]Both of these or health.
[20:12.95]I can do both, right?
[20:17.25]No, I can't.
[20:18.84]It's either both of these or the health boost.
[20:26.96]You don't need the glasses.
[20:28.12]Yeah, I do need this though.
[20:38.72]I could do this and heal, I think, right?
[20:41.77]That will heal you, that's true.
[20:43.41]Yep.
[20:47.37]Hit the pole.
[20:55.17]Fuck off.
[20:58.19]This is over.
[21:07.19]Okay.
[21:07.83]I think I still have a one.
[21:10.45]I can do two outs.
[21:14.05]That was really hard to hit and I think I got it.
[21:15.56]Alright.
[21:16.60]We're good.
[21:21.42]Let's go.
[21:24.92]Pull it all the way back.
[21:26.66]Back to 100 health.
[21:27.34]Okay.
[21:41.62]Get over!
[21:49.40]Shit.
[21:50.42]Sorry.
[21:55.21]Get up!
[21:56.83]Come on.
[21:57.65]Don't do it like this.
[22:08.84]Adios, baseball.
[22:11.14]Alright, this is very important.
[22:13.30]I can do both!
[22:31.03]I could heal, but no, I gotta do both of these.
[22:34.69]I have to do bat and steroids.
[22:41.06]I don't think I can heal roids and steroids.
[22:47.46]Okay.
[22:47.98]Yep.
[22:48.28]Let's go.
[22:49.47]God damn it, dude!
[22:52.43]No way!
[22:53.29]Are you serious?
[22:54.61]No way!
[23:11.46]That's so hard.
[23:12.56]It's ridiculous.
[23:13.80]Alright, one more try and that's it.
[23:17.74]And I'll move.
[23:18.32]I'll play something else.
[23:24.52]One more try.
[23:30.83]That thing comes in so fast.
[23:33.29]It's out of here.
[23:43.58]What a failure already.
[23:48.45]What's the stream title?
[23:51.13]Baseball stream 2.0.
[23:54.75]Wallet is a bit tight.
[23:56.57]Wait, what are you talking about?
[23:58.29]Wallet is a bit tight.
[24:00.90]Featuring fishies with that face.
[24:06.62]What?
[24:15.10]Get up.
[24:15.34]That should have hit.
[24:21.96]If the heal pops up, it's happening immediately.
[24:30.24]That heal is necessary for any run.
[24:47.77]It's not here, so I'll take this one then.
[24:51.34]Hope you don't mind if I throw a little harder, kid.
[24:53.58]Adios, baseball.
[25:09.86]Stay fair.
[25:13.39]Home run.
[25:21.62]Need heal.
[25:34.89]Charge the mound.
[25:35.95]This guy just throws fast.
[25:45.96]The other one has curveballs.
[25:46.94]Another inning in the book.
[25:48.26]One more to go.
[25:53.39]There it is.
[25:53.79]Alright, now we're in business.
[26:01.81]Need to get this health back.
[26:24.90]Those pitches are such bullshit when they go down like that.
[26:29.54]Again.
[26:37.49]I got to keep the cursor down.
[26:44.08]Yeah, it's stay down.
[26:45.88]I was thinking stay right in the middle so you can have equal place to go anywhere.
[26:58.32]Still sticking with it.
[27:00.48]Yeah, no.
[27:01.62]Lower thirds of the strike zone.
[27:12.93]Alright, let's go.
[27:14.43]How much health do I have?
[27:32.90]Reduce the speed and bat size.
[27:39.43]How many trees died to make that bat of yours?
[27:41.99]Okay.
[27:43.55]Alright, I gotta focus.
[27:45.67]50 health.
[27:47.27]Come on, man.
[28:03.73]home run home run that's got enough three in a row
[28:40.12]That was a weird pitch, but I still got it.
[28:43.64]Nice.
[28:44.26]Does the game account for where you click on the ball?
[28:48.82]Does it change the angle?
[28:49.66]It does.
[28:51.22]So you have to get slightly under the ball.
[28:58.59]Alright, slower pitches I think is the way to go.
[29:05.38]Because that's 12%.
[29:06.62]Although it might mess me up.
[29:08.83]I'll do it.
[29:09.17]Come on.
[29:10.43]That's enough.
[29:36.56]Home run.
[29:42.59]Three in a row.
[29:54.07]Over it.
[30:00.53]Goodbye baseball.
[30:06.88]Nice.
[30:07.22]Alright.
[30:09.66]I've got a good amount of health.
[30:10.76]I've just got to be very, very early to swing.
[30:13.10]Why are you mad?
[30:13.48]Oh, I'm not.
[30:13.78]I'm just focusing.
[30:14.88]Gravity.
[30:15.14]5% of 30 is more.
[30:16.72]What should I do?
[30:17.72]I don't know.
[30:44.72]This is important too, though.
[30:50.75]Gum or gravity?
[30:54.23]I'll go gum.
[30:56.65]Because if I just have to hit, I just need to, I'll heal.
[31:01.23]Alright.
[31:02.23]This is very fast.
[31:03.73]Good start.
[31:04.19]What?
[31:27.13]That's a moon shot.
[31:34.41]Oh, ball behind me.
[31:36.04]Way under it.
[31:36.54]It's out of here.
[31:52.97]Grrrr!
[32:00.39]oh man that's it I thought that I whatever it's so hard you too have experienced loss they made my uncle into a super psycho baseball that was fun that was a good I this is this is hard it's supposed to be a chill stream it is like but I can't say um f you
[32:28.43]It's so fast.
[32:30.39]One more.
[32:30.75]One more.
[32:33.37]I have to beat the tree.
[32:39.43]What's your refresh rate? 144?
[32:52.24]Alright, the real stupid thing here is to lose any health against this first two innings.
[32:59.00]Right?
[33:00.04]This first inning, you should not lose a single health.
[33:15.54]My mom just heard you swear, and she said my Jerma privileges are revoked.
[33:25.97]Well, I'll tell you something you can do.
[33:32.73]You've got to put something on the table.
[33:35.12]You've got to put some type of bargaining chip on the table.
[33:41.98]I'll clean my room.
[33:44.80]I'll help with some chores around the house.
[33:49.23]You've got to put some bargaining chips up.
[33:53.76]I'll help you move furniture, right?
[33:58.48]Be like, I'm sorry that the guy that I watch sucks.
[34:04.48]There it is.
[34:05.00]No, that's not what I want.
[34:12.90]Isn't this just better?
[34:20.94]This is just better.
[34:24.77]Go ahead.
[34:25.45]Call me a one-pitch Andy.
[34:31.32]That makes six in a row.
[34:34.80]Hey, guess what?
[34:35.32]Next time your mother comes in with groceries, get off your ass and go help.
[34:40.30]He's on fire.
[34:41.36]That's seven in a row.
[34:45.13]And then... I don't know.
[34:48.07]Maybe it's like, oh, okay.
[34:48.87]Maybe you can get some of your privileges back or whatever.
[34:53.94]Dad?
[34:54.34]Hey, next time your mother shows up at the grocery, get off your ass and help.
[35:10.99]Thanks, Dad.
[35:13.89]Another inning in the book.
[35:15.45]One more to go.
[35:17.11]Alright, this has been good so far.
[35:23.94]I got a lot of money.
[35:26.14]Steroids and bat.
[35:36.12]Eleven!
[35:37.54]Oh!
[35:38.12]Did he just say holy pog?
[35:46.31]I'm getting more money with the multiplier.
[35:49.27]I'm getting a lot more money with the multiplier.
[35:53.10]Oh, that was out of the strike zone.
[36:00.85]Whatever.
[36:13.75]You have to get them in a row.
[36:15.05]That's how you get the money to buy everything.
[36:22.36]Alright, pray for a heal in between innings here, because I need it.
[36:25.09]Nice.
[36:27.05]Alright, there's the first heal.
[36:30.93]5% every time I hit a home run.
[36:34.17]And steroids.
[36:34.67]I can't afford it.
[36:36.56]Should I just hold?
[36:53.92]I'm gonna hold.
[36:54.30]I don't know if I want... I think I want accuracy.
[36:59.18]I don't think I want the... You didn't hold?
[37:04.36]Let me hold the money.
[37:05.38]I don't think I want... I think I want accuracy.
[37:21.65]That's got to be enough.
[37:22.37]Come on.
[37:23.35]I need to heal to full health right here.
[37:24.93]5% of 130 is a lot.
[37:26.21]Get under it.
[37:26.57]Get under it.
[37:26.85]That was like scripted talking.
[37:31.34]Get under it.
[37:52.62]Adios, baseball.
[37:54.00]Stay fair.
[38:00.33]Alright.
[38:00.79]Good.
[38:02.31]Adios, baseball.
[38:03.69]Going to be faster.
[38:05.53]I got a lot of money.
[38:06.59]One inning down.
[38:07.49]Two to go.
[38:13.94]Oh, yeah.
[38:15.56]Oh, man.
[38:17.96]This is a big deal.
[38:18.78]This is huge if I could do this.
[38:29.42]And bubblegum.
[38:43.39]Jesus, those are two bad ones in a row.
[38:50.45]So what... How much am I healing for right now?
[38:52.45]Does anybody pay attention?
[38:53.43]I can't look.
[38:59.90]How much am I healing for?
[39:01.60]A lot?
[39:02.56]13.
[39:02.60]That's awesome.
[39:05.58]Oh, back to fucking full health.
[39:07.36]Let's go.
[39:07.72]Just don't blow it.
[39:11.32]Never mind.
[39:14.81]Oh my god, I'm gonna choke.
[39:30.20]Oh, thank God.
[39:30.98]Stay fair.
[39:38.76]I'm alright.
[39:39.62]I'm alright.
[39:40.04]I just made up all the health I just lost.
[39:41.60]Yes.
[39:41.68]Okay.
[39:45.42]Full health.
[39:47.62]I have to win this right now.
[40:02.37]Ugh.
[40:02.49]I don't know what to pick.
[40:06.47]All of these are very important.
[40:08.53]It's probably steroids, though.
[40:15.86]I don't have enough for Devil 3.
[40:19.96]Oh, shit.
[40:20.52]I don't have enough.
[40:21.18]I have to do... Alright.
[40:24.82]I don't... I didn't have enough.
[40:25.64]I had 122.
[40:28.22]I'm gonna hold this, though.
[40:29.86]Alright.
[40:30.77]Psycho mode activated.
[40:32.39]My curveball could chop a tree down, but I would never do that, of course.
[40:38.52]Come on, good start.
[40:41.26]Boring, hello!
[41:00.34]Jesus Christ.
[41:05.02]It's so hard.
[41:09.57]Get out.
[41:17.61]It's out of here.
[41:21.56]Shit.
[41:36.56]Get out!
[41:38.88]My hands are sweating.
[41:39.82]Home run!
[42:10.18]That's it.
[42:10.64]I got it.
[42:12.42]Alright.
[42:14.14]Now what?
[42:19.52]There's another level after this.
[42:21.61]How many levels are there?
[42:26.13]I don't know what to do.
[42:27.33]Should I boost the HP even more or do power?
[42:36.15]Power, I think, is what I need.
[42:39.73]I'm going to hold this.
[42:43.94]Because I have to buy this next time.
[42:53.16]Harry, he's a little crazy.
[42:57.94]Look at the size of this wall.
[42:59.82]What?
[43:00.60]What just happened?
[43:01.22]The ball didn't even come out of his hand.
[43:06.38]Excuse me?
[43:10.91]Where's the ball?
[43:18.67]Oh my... Dude!
[43:35.93]By the way, any ladies watching?
[43:37.77]I am single.
[43:44.13]Well, we got to the end of that one.
[43:45.41]That was fun.
[43:48.51]You can't call that a skill issue.
[43:49.95]That was... Good luck if you want to... At Super Psycho Baseball, good luck if you want to play it.
[43:58.38]At level 3, it's very difficult.
[44:01.98]And good luck.
[44:05.88]Alright, do I have anything else I can start?
[44:07.04]Let me see.
[44:08.35]That was fun.
[44:12.81]What else do I have here?
[44:17.18]I don't know if there's anything I could really do for that much longer.
[44:20.12]Let's see.
[44:23.96]If you're wondering what's happening tomorrow, Ster and I are going to play this game called Ember.
[44:30.54]It's like a firefighter game.
[44:31.88]It's like a wacky firefighter game, I think.
[44:35.13]I don't know what time we're going to start.
[44:37.07]I'll talk to him tonight and see.
[44:46.07]That game is amazing.
[44:46.81]Okay.
[44:47.87]Good.
[44:49.83]Yeah, I think I'll probably just call it here.
[44:51.51]I think it's a good time.
[45:00.04]I have a lot of games to play, but a lot of them are not 45-minute experiences.
[45:08.18]Go back and finish the other game.
[45:16.12]When are you going to watch Biodome?
[45:20.86]I don't think I'm going to watch Biodome, man.
[45:28.00]Yeah, that's... I'll call it here.
[45:30.88]I'll see you tomorrow.
[45:33.03]And then the plan going forward from here is... Driver 1 is going to be a part of a bigger PlayStation 1 Xbox 360 night.
[45:46.26]There's still probably five games down there on the Reddit shelf that I never played.
[45:53.35]They're kind of just sitting down there.
[45:54.31]There's like at least five or six games that I never played down there.
[45:57.43]So definitely gonna play them.
[46:01.85]What about the Ace Attorney games?
[46:03.37]I did hear that...
[46:05.97]There's a new Ace Attorney game that released.
[46:08.93]And there's no white flashing.
[46:11.90]So, I mean, I could probably play that now.
[46:15.02]Or you can disable white flashing.
[46:19.81]PS1 and 360 are 10 years apart.
[46:21.51]Well, I mean, I have a range.
[46:23.33]I'm going to play Driver 1, a few more PlayStation 1 games, a few PlayStation 2 games.
[46:27.77]The rest is some of these stragglers of Xbox and Xbox 360 games that we never played from, like, I'm talking five years ago.
[46:35.56]Four or five years ago.
[46:37.08]They're here.
[46:39.74]The new trilogy has an option for that.
[46:41.12]Okay.
[46:44.46]Yeah.
[46:47.67]That's the plan.
[46:49.78]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[46:51.10]I don't have a time, but I'll make sure the sauce is updated.
[46:55.48]And I'll see you tomorrow.
[46:57.28]Thanks for watching.
[46:57.80]Take care.
[46:59.02]See you soon.
[46:59.70]It's a chill stream.
[47:00.34]We just kind of hang out.
[47:02.32]I do want to do a lot more of these.
[47:05.80]I am very much in the market for doing more just kind of play games and hang out streams.
[47:14.34]2023 is going to be the year of just streaming games and hanging out.
[47:20.95]We're going to be kind of going back to the basics here.
[47:28.21]What about sorcery?
[47:34.77]Yeah.
[47:37.09]I'll fit everything in.
[47:45.71]I definitely do want to incorporate way more streams like this.
[47:50.40]But we can just kind of fuck around and play something.
[47:53.09]Doesn't have to be anything, you know, in particular, like, oh, it's got to be this.
[47:56.25]It's got to be that.
[47:56.79]It's just like, you know what?
[47:57.45]I'm going to open up Super Psycho Baseball and play for an hour.
[48:00.89]I'm going to play this game for like four hours, whatever.
[48:03.49]That's what I'm going to do.
[48:08.12]Which also, be honest, that means that.
[48:13.16]Each stream is... I will not be against now.
[48:17.29]Not like I was against it before.
[48:19.31]But actually starting games and playing through them and finishing them.
[48:24.67]I know I abandoned one literally an hour ago.
[48:27.33]But, you know.
[48:30.02]There are games that have been on this list of, I mean, like Paper Mario, for instance.
[48:34.82]It's just like, do I really want to play Paper Mario for like the 20, 30, 40 hours that it... Yeah, probably.
[48:41.74]Breath of the Wild.
[48:42.48]Oh, yeah.
[48:42.94]No, I'll go.
[48:43.46]Don't worry.
[48:43.90]I'll go back to it.
[48:49.00]There's a lot of stuff to do.
[48:58.29]Finish Yakuza.
[48:59.97]Honestly, Finish Yakuza has got to a point where it would be Restart Yakuza because I have not played it in two to three straight years.
[49:13.22]Is Battle Act still happening?
[49:14.40]Oh, yes.
[49:17.64]It very much is.
[49:25.60]Alright.
[49:26.10]Oh, I didn't even have the music playing.
[49:28.62]Thanks for watching.
[49:29.14]Thanks for hanging out.
[49:30.94]Have a good rest of your night, guys.
[49:33.06]See you tomorrow.
[49:36.06]The game is going to be Ember.
[49:40.67]Take care.
[49:41.65]Call your mother.
[49:43.61]You know.
[49:53.36]you
[50:28.22]Thank you.
[51:03.10]you
