[00:00.95]Hey, can't wait to get my next game on Origin.
[00:02.95]Alright, be careful with this.
[00:04.53]This is like a weird indie game, so be careful with the loud noise that might happen.
[00:07.67]Are we not going to have to make an account for this?
[00:10.01]I don't know.
[00:10.65]I don't think so.
[00:11.27]Alright, I'm turning my volume way down.
[00:14.59]I'm just muting.
[00:15.19]You're going to be muted for a second because I'm just killing all of my desktop audio.
[00:19.66]Just open it and see what happens.
[00:21.72]Yeah, you can tell when it's going to be a whole lot of... It's like a Unity window just popped up and just said, would you like to have run this in a window?
[00:36.10]It's actually not that bad.
[00:38.00]Audio-wise.
[00:40.76]You need to register.
[00:43.84]And it is just stuck connecting, I think.
[00:50.13]Huh.
[00:51.95]Well... I think this might actually be through Steam.
[00:56.51]It says connecting, and the connecting is grayed out.
[00:58.97]Do you see that as well?
[01:12.83]Hold on.
[01:14.27]Log in.
[01:14.84]I think I can do it now.
[01:15.68]I have to get my birthday.
[01:18.18]Does this really matter?
[01:20.66]All right.
[01:23.58]How come there's nothing before?
[01:24.78]Oh, there it is.
[01:33.57]Make a fast run.
[01:35.03]Is he still with us?
[01:36.97]Is that taken?
[01:37.55]Okay.
[01:37.73]Oh boy.
[01:50.56]By the way, just to- hold on, I don't- the password is in plain text and it's not even hashed.
[01:55.86]So if you have a password italics that you use, do not type it in because- thank God the fucking screen was off because it is plain text password.
[02:06.12]So do not write a password that you use for fucking anything.
[02:10.88]Wow.
[02:12.64]Good fucking thing because- Take a look at this.
[02:20.76]Oh, this ain't an issue.
[02:21.98]Oh, there.
[02:22.58]What's my password?
[02:26.53]Uh-huh.
[02:27.25]I imagine.
[02:33.99]Hide password.
[02:35.29]Okay.
[02:40.91]There's a hide pass- I'm too- I don't want to touch it.
[02:43.21]Okay.
[02:45.15]Why would you not have it be by default?
[02:49.24]Why would there be a hide password checkbox?
[02:52.93]What?
[02:55.21]Who do I want to see that?
[02:57.51]Okay.
[02:59.13]I need to register.
[03:20.49]Well, yeah guys what hey, well, where's the where is it?
[03:24.29]Huh?
[03:24.85]Where's my checkbox?
[03:26.11]Jesus Christ Oh
[03:45.77]It starts with one.
[03:46.69]Did we lose italics, by the way?
[03:49.39]Italics?
[03:50.39]I'm here, but I'm trying to sign up.
[03:51.99]Yeah, we're both signing up.
[03:53.45]Hopefully this works.
[04:20.19]Okay.
[04:21.33]So I'm registering right now.
[04:22.79]Please don't, please tell me I don't.
[04:26.41]Okay, I'm now registered.
[04:28.74]Yeah, you have to activate your account.
[04:32.34]It better be worth it.
[04:35.10]Black screen with music right now.
[04:41.26]What is that?
[04:41.98]I made like a bunch of dumb accounts.
[04:45.35]I'm currently waiting on a...
[04:48.58]Wait, did you not get an email?
[04:52.21]Is this game on Twitch?
[04:54.29]I don't think so.
[04:55.39]It is.
[04:55.71]WolfQuest.
[04:56.55]There it is.
[05:02.06]Confirmation.
[05:03.06]Register.
[05:03.68]Thank you for registering.
[05:04.82]Okay, your account's been activated.
[05:06.08]You can now log in.
[05:07.76]Okay, log in.
[05:19.53]All right, here we go.
[05:21.99]Account info, achievements, friends.
[05:24.01]Okay, what is your friend?
[05:26.83]What's your name?
[05:27.81]Hang on, it's activating right now.
[05:31.21]Let me log in.
[05:36.14]Messages, add friend.
[05:38.06]We can create a pack.
[05:41.62]I'll turn this audio down.
[05:44.58]Audio overload.
[05:45.78]Steam is back up.
[05:46.50]It's too late.
[05:46.82]It's too late.
[05:47.16]Hold on.
[05:47.38]I gotta change my title.
[05:48.46]Just making the name Wolfpack.
[06:18.19]What bird?
[06:27.76]Okay, I see you now.
[06:32.10]Oh, this game's already good.
[06:36.15]Okay, are you, let's go to Ad Friend.
[06:41.71]What's your name?
[06:47.50]Did I scare the bird away?
[06:48.78]Alright, what's your name on WolfQuest?
[06:54.41]Are you here?
[07:00.89]What's your name on WolfQuest, man?
[07:04.91]WolfQuest.
[07:05.65]Need your name on WolfQuest.
[07:08.30]E-T-A-L.
[07:09.84]E-T-A-L.
[07:12.88]Everybody add me to your Wolfpack.
[07:16.90]What?
[07:19.26]E-T-A-L, add as a friend.
[07:20.72]Yep.
[07:22.74]If that player accepts, then we can be buddies, and then we can make a pact.
[07:25.72]Mighty bike.
[07:27.00]That's me, mighty bike.
[07:28.34]Mm-hmm.
[07:31.18]Are we friends?
[07:32.40]We are.
[07:33.06]You're on my friends list, so... You're at least parasocially my friend.
[07:52.21]okay so let's now how do we play
[08:21.97]Oh, yeah.
[09:34.28]Okay.
[09:37.58]So, uh, are you, uh, are we here?
[09:42.46]Yeah, we're here.
[09:46.35]Are you here?
[09:46.99]Yeah, how do we play?
[09:51.01]Multiplayer.
[09:53.43]I swear to God, this shows my goddamn password.
[09:55.91]We start a new game.
[09:58.75]Public game, private game.
[10:04.05]What do we do here?
[10:05.27]I don't know.
[10:05.75]I'm afraid of a public game.
[10:10.85]Join game.
[10:12.63]I'm trying to log into this new GeoCities account that I just got from my guild.
[10:28.40]Is this servers?
[10:29.92]How does this work?
[10:32.26]Is that just a joint?
[10:33.18]Alright, I'm gonna make my wolf.
[10:34.20]This is really important.
[10:46.66]Abilities?
[10:49.34]Male.
[10:49.68]What?
[10:49.88]No, no, no.
[10:50.56]Come on.
[10:56.20]Canyon pack?
[10:57.22]These are the same dog.
[10:58.62]I mean, this one's a little different.
[11:04.18]What's the difference between these two, besides the shade?
[11:07.06]Life is rough, Peck.
[11:09.67]And these are pigs!
[11:11.55]That's a pig!
[11:13.21]This one could be a dog, but the rest of these are pigs.
[11:17.54]Okay, that's fine.
[11:24.82]I'm already done.
[11:27.78]No, we're doing our own game.
[11:41.27]We're doing our own game.
[11:42.69]Private game.
[11:51.69]Game name and password required.
[11:53.19]Okay, I'm gonna start a new game.
[11:58.18]That's fine.
[12:00.22]Selectable.
[12:01.09]Mighty bite.
[12:02.29]Hold on.
[12:04.53]I gotta... Pack life?
[12:10.35]Lost river.
[12:11.81]Dusk.
[12:13.29]Chat type.
[12:14.87]Literally no text in chat.
[12:16.19]Okay, pack raised pups.
[12:17.55]So we're doing multiplayer, right?
[12:18.89]Holy shit, huge money.
[12:20.78]Yes, I believe.
[12:21.92]Alright, hold on.
[12:22.38]Let's just make sure we get this right.
[12:24.22]I'm gonna like... I have to turn this game down.
[12:28.12]I think I have to join you.
[12:31.36]How do you make a character?
[12:32.60]I can't believe I'm asking that question, but yes, how do you make a character?
[12:36.92]You have to go to join multiplayer and then join game, and then you'll do it.
[12:40.04]Give me one size at a time.
[12:43.62]Sorry, I just cut you off.
[12:45.06]I'm sorry about that, but hold on.
[12:48.06]BasicFeral, thank you for the $100.
[12:49.30]Thank you so much, dude.
[12:52.98]GuildJokeBestJoke, are you going to be playing new WoW expansion?
[12:57.51]I don't think so.
[12:58.61]I feel like I'm so removed from the game at this point that I couldn't get back into it.
[13:02.78]But it looks interesting.
[13:04.80]They got rid of artifact weapons, but I don't know how the hell they're going to deal with that.
[13:07.78]But that's interesting.
[13:09.70]But thank you, BasicFeral, so much for the 100 bucks, dude.
[13:12.34]I much appreciate that, dude.
[13:14.18]I know I said dude like four times, but you get the idea.
[13:19.44]Alright, so let me see.
[13:21.50]If I go here...
[13:26.02]Yeah, I can give you a password.
[13:27.17]Can you hear me?
[13:33.89]Can you hear me?
[13:36.69]Can you hear me now?
[13:37.78]Can you hear me now?
[13:38.32]Okay, I want it to be pack life or what do you think?
[13:46.02]Pack life or raise pups?
[13:48.22]I'm gonna say raise pups.
[13:49.29]That sounds like more interesting.
[13:57.36]I mean, I did deafen him, but he should not be deafened anymore.
[13:59.94]No, he deafened me this time.
[14:01.88]Yeah, you gotta make the pups first.
[14:09.70]Alright, I'm gonna give him the game name and password.
[14:15.40]Just give us a second while we do it.
[14:31.12]All right.
[14:33.08]Filtered name.
[14:34.94]How?
[14:37.12]That just gave me... Hold on.
[14:45.68]Okay, so... Apparently that's a name I can't use.
[14:51.96]Filtered name.
[14:54.38]Why?
[14:56.33]What's your name again?
[14:57.55]I'm trying to make a game name, a private game, and all these things I'm writing are banned.
[15:04.92]Huh.
[15:05.44]Okay, if this is filtered, then I don't understand.
[15:08.86]Huh.
[15:15.68]All right, let's see this.
[15:16.98]Okay, apparently Having Fun is a filtered name.
[15:20.53]The name of the game is Having Fun.
[15:24.43]Are you sure you're not doing like an illegal space or character or something like that?
[15:27.43]Just watch.
[15:29.29]I can't, but I'll take your word for it.
[15:33.95]Is it space?
[15:39.17]These little tie with the... Alright, I got a game.
[15:42.61]I got a game.
[15:43.05]I got a game.
[15:43.49]I got a game.
[15:44.43]I got a game.
[15:46.03]That's what I like to hear.
[15:46.89]Check the box.
[15:47.91]No spaces.
[15:53.48]wait I gotta make my wolf first space is illegal but that's because hold on a second did you we saw game names that had spaces back in the server list what all right the password I'm just going to mute and say it to you so hold on how do we do this I'm just going to type it in discord
[16:20.46]Okay.
[16:21.02]The password, I just typed it to you in Discord.
[16:23.09]There it is.
[16:24.51]Name of the game, you'll see it.
[16:25.71]Don't worry.
[16:31.37]Please wait while the game loads.
[16:33.13]Thank God.
[16:36.47]Survival of the fittest.
[16:38.81]Wait.
[16:39.13]Whoops.
[16:41.21]Initializing the server.
[16:42.65]Holy fuck, this is a lot of information.
[16:47.06]Hello.
[16:47.48]Oh, what?
[16:49.04]Look for a den...
[16:51.55]Oh god, hold on, I got big money here.
[16:53.37]Alright, uh, yeah, it's having fun, and I gave you the password in Discord.
[16:59.95]Okay, I'm gonna make my wolf.
[17:01.81]Yeah, make your wolf, and I got to say hello to somebody.
[17:07.58]Hey!
[17:09.32]Thank you so much, MostlyLost, for the $100, $200 donations here in the room.
[17:13.44]Thanks a lot, man.
[17:16.41]Hey, Jeremy, I'm about to be going to Europe for six weeks, so I won't be able to catch many streams.
[17:22.48]Hopefully this should cover all the stupid $100 bit jokes I would have done in that time.
[17:27.24]Love you, Jeremy.
[17:27.92]You're a great presence in all of our lives, so keep doing what you do.
[17:30.68]Also, what's all this I hear about Dean with a V?
[17:35.30]You know, thank you so much, but $100, usually I read the whole thing, but not this time.
[17:41.14]Thank you so much, man.
[17:42.64]Have a good trip to Europe.
[17:47.84]What are you doing out there?
[17:49.70]Just kind of going out there?
[17:51.60]For a specific reason?
[17:54.95]Thank you so much, dude.
[17:57.03]I just need to make sure that he can get in here.
[18:00.37]I'm also going to go like this.
[18:03.43]Do I have a random shitty image here?
[18:07.96]I feel like this is one of those games that doesn't give a shit about privacy.
[18:12.60]I'm going to do this.
[18:13.92]We're going to put Boshi down here.
[18:17.03]No, let's just put here.
[18:18.37]This is my webcam for tonight.
[18:19.77]Okay.
[18:30.98]I just want to make sure.
[18:35.30]So here's the wolf.
[18:36.36]Express yourself.
[18:37.72]Press E to open the emotes panel where you can express yourself through accurate wolf behaviors.
[18:41.84]Are you here?
[18:43.84]Yeah, I'm almost done.
[18:44.78]Okay.
[18:45.70]So, let's see.
[18:46.84]How do we do it?
[18:50.87]No, here are your new emotes, guys.
[18:52.35]You got this game for free.
[18:53.51]No?
[18:53.97]Nobody bought it.
[18:55.43]Smile at each other?
[18:56.33]Okay.
[19:00.27]I thought this was...
[19:13.37]This is bad.
[19:18.54]I'm so ugly in this picture.
[19:20.06]I want to let the record show that I think this is a great idea.
[19:24.74]Let's do it.
[19:26.06]Well, we haven't even started.
[19:28.44]Look, it's not our fault that Steam went down for like 25 minutes.
[19:31.84]Uh-oh.
[19:32.66]Uh-oh.
[19:34.42]Hold on.
[19:35.54]Antivirus wants to have a word with this game.
[19:37.78]Really?
[19:38.02]Well, it's on Steam.
[19:38.94]They don't put anything illegal on here, do they?
[19:44.41]No, I have to give it permission.
[19:45.82]Ugly in every picture.
[19:48.30]I need to wait for you, because we need to, like, fight stuff.
[19:51.12]Yeah, well, okay.
[19:52.22]Hold on.
[19:52.74]Is that you?
[19:53.00]I'm going to put it in the info now.
[19:55.04]No, I'm not in.
[19:55.62]Did somebody hack it?
[19:56.70]All right.
[19:57.48]Cover the left bottom portion of your screen with an image of anything.
[20:01.66]Okay.
[20:02.41]I'm, like, scared that it's going to be like, oh, yeah, come on down to 106.
[20:05.19]How do you do that without switching?
[20:10.41]Is there a password?
[20:11.87]Yeah, I put it in the Discord.
[20:15.11]Uh, you only wrote one thing.
[20:16.91]Yeah, that's the password.
[20:18.79]Oh, well, I have to know the game name, too.
[20:20.81]The game name is No Spaces Having Fun.
[20:26.01]Well, does it say the password on screen?
[20:28.61]Um, maybe.
[20:30.01]Just be careful.
[20:30.47]So what are we covering?
[20:31.75]Well, it says, like, it's gonna say, like, the server info in the bottom left portion of the screen, and I don't want it to say my, like, home address.
[20:40.49]Uh...
[20:42.75]Why am I... I'm just full... Does it take a while to load in?
[20:46.09]No.
[20:46.85]Just do like a full screen image of your face.
[20:49.43]For like a minute while you make sure it doesn't say anything.
[20:54.03]Well, because I see snow.
[20:55.62]Connection failure.
[20:57.98]Connection failure.
[20:59.88]I'm going to try restarting the game because I had to do that like... Maybe like a firewall thing.
[21:05.22]Or steam could be down.
[21:06.66]Is there a dragon in this game?
[21:09.23]A dragon!
[21:09.73]Look at this dragon up here.
[21:11.13]It's a curled up dragon sleeping.
[21:23.72]I won.
[21:29.81]It's a private game.
[21:31.45]Yep, private game, having fun, no spaces, no capitals.
[21:33.97]It didn't save my wolf!
[21:35.96]It's alright.
[21:38.08]Well, I completed one of the achievements.
[21:40.84]See, look on the little compass up there.
[21:43.02]That's definitely a Hydra.
[21:46.55]Let's go find the Hydra while we wait for Talos.
[21:52.53]That just scared the shit out of me.
[21:53.79]I thought that was a giant monster.
[21:55.19]It was my reflection in the water.
[21:57.41]Game name.
[21:58.43]Haven.
[21:59.61]H-A-V-I-N-G.
[22:01.65]F-U-N.
[22:01.83]Fun.
[22:02.03]Okay, and then... Password is that password that I put in the Discord.
[22:07.69]Okay.
[22:10.87]Weird that you decided to choose emojis for your password.
[22:13.24]This is great.
[22:17.94]Makes things more complicated.
[22:19.58]Like a Unity engine detected.
[22:23.77]Wait, I'm in.
[22:24.77]All right.
[22:25.87]What the hell is this?
[22:27.47]Oh, there's 80 game controls.
[22:31.31]What do you mean, cover the bottom left?
[22:32.97]That's chat box.
[22:34.77]Yeah, but, okay, it just gave me your personal email in there.
[22:38.23]Really?
[22:38.55]Whatever you used for an email.
[22:40.81]What's your name?
[22:42.19]Oh, no, that's just your name.
[22:43.21]Okay, we're good.
[22:43.71]That's just your name and your login name.
[22:47.19]Okay, for a second, I thought you had your own email, like footpad at italics.com.
[22:54.13]No.
[22:54.93]I thought that was like your... Okay, here you are.
[23:01.97]So, I'm coming up to you.
[23:07.37]Oh, boy.
[23:07.61]We have to hunt together.
[23:10.08]This is... Oh, dear.
[23:13.08]For some reason, you understand... I want to make sure that we have... Actual virus game.
[23:21.72]People need to understand something.
[23:23.78]Uh-huh.
[23:25.46]When I clicked that image to delete my facecam, that fake, shitty, dumb face, OBS crashed.
[23:32.98]So I didn't turn this back on.
[23:35.11]I didn't put that image back on the screen.
[23:36.51]It's just back on here.
[23:42.53]Okay.
[23:42.75]For the love of God.
[23:45.41]I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.
[23:46.57]I need to make this tiny because it's going to take over the whole screen.
[23:53.18]All right.
[23:53.82]Glad I found that button first.
[23:55.32]I can't, like, click that off.
[23:56.80]How do you do that?
[23:57.68]I want to do that.
[24:02.01]No, it's me.
[24:03.15]I'm the one that howls.
[24:04.57]Can I, like, bite you on the neck?
[24:06.23]Are you playing with a controller or with a keyboard?
[24:07.65]Oh, there it is.
[24:09.26]We have to do it at the same time.
[24:14.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:15.86]Time it, really?
[24:17.08]No, because if you're with the wolves, you have to... You have to howl first, then I howl later when I hear you.
[24:22.94]You know, Sam, when Sam puts the ladder in, I've made this reference before.
[24:27.20]But that's from Cleverser Explains It All.
[24:30.06]Okay, you ready?
[24:32.75]One, two, three.
[24:36.35]Woo!
[24:43.11]Good game.
[24:44.53]I'm rating it two thumbs up on Steam.
[24:46.15]Come on, what if I bow?
[24:55.21]Okay, slow down there, killer.
[24:57.23]Okay.
[24:59.99]Hey, let me get you an achievement.
[25:01.17]Come with me.
[25:03.04]Come with me.
[25:04.08]Come with me.
[25:06.64]Look, there's a dinosaur over here.
[25:08.34]That's actually a dinosaur.
[25:10.16]No, it's not.
[25:11.68]What is that?
[25:16.63]Oh, it's a carcass.
[25:18.21]What is this?
[25:19.57]What animal is this?
[25:20.31]Let me just have some of that.
[25:21.47]How do you eat?
[25:23.83]Are you playing with what?
[25:25.39]A keyboard.
[25:26.89]I'm playing with the Xbox controller.
[25:28.45]Are you?
[25:28.93]You can do that?
[25:29.51]Oh, that's much better.
[25:30.37]Okay, how do you do that?
[25:31.89]Uh, A. Make sure you get your dinner, Mighty Bite.
[25:37.94]That elk carcass is almost gone.
[25:44.39]Alright, come with me.
[25:44.97]Let's go over here.
[25:45.95]We have to find something to hunt.
[25:48.91]I'm in Smell-O-Vision?
[25:49.99]Alright.
[25:52.20]That PlayStation 2 game.
[25:54.18]This is the same game.
[25:55.12]The guy loves that game.
[25:56.20]Hang on.
[25:56.66]I'm smelling you.
[25:58.86]You have yellow smell puffs.
[26:01.66]Yeah, you do too.
[26:02.24]Some corn puffs.
[26:04.01]You're leaving them behind you as you go.
[26:05.51]Stop crop dusting me.
[26:07.75]Alright, we need to find an animal to hunt.
[26:13.00]I'm hunting you.
[26:16.17]Kill or be killed.
[26:16.81]Is there a sprint?
[26:17.75]There we go.
[26:18.21]I left a stick.
[26:20.75]Is it just me or is it really dizzying to play this with a thumbstick, actually?
[26:27.25]Hey, Sam.
[26:31.18]Are you behind me?
[26:32.60]Yeah.
[26:34.38]How are your stats?
[26:35.18]You know, I went with speed.
[26:38.36]There are stats in this game?
[26:40.12]There are stats.
[26:40.84]There's speed, there's strength, and there's stamina.
[26:46.41]You can also change your camera by clicking the right thumbstick.
[26:48.87]All right.
[26:49.31]Don't go in the water.
[26:49.99]It's going to make you throw up.
[26:52.05]FOV makes me vomit.
[26:53.17]How's that?
[26:53.99]Now we're just... If you zoom all the way out by tilting thumbstick down, you could just play World of Warcraft.
[27:00.83]God, I wish we were playing Overcooked still.
[27:07.15]Is Steam actually back up?
[27:08.53]Was that a joke or is it for real?
[27:15.72]I don't know.
[27:16.46]I think it was legitimately down.
[27:18.58]Again, we're supposed to be finding a den to make our home in.
[27:23.74]So we have to find a den.
[27:24.90]So we can go either northeast, southeast.
[27:30.02]Those are the two closest dens.
[27:34.09]Which one would you like to go to in this worldwide simulator?
[27:37.47]This is the biggest overworld.
[27:38.95]Let's just go northeast.
[27:42.92]Is there a jump button?
[27:44.20]I don't think there is.
[27:44.76]There's a den up here.
[27:52.02]Why are you faster than me?
[27:53.70]Because I put all my points in speed.
[27:55.70]What the fuck?
[27:58.24]I put like 80% points in speed, but I have no stamina and I'm weak.
[28:04.05]go back to the last game, not next.
[28:07.83]Wolves don't jump?
[28:08.65]Yeah, they do.
[28:11.79]Let's at least just go to the den.
[28:14.13]We have to get our... How much was this game?
[28:17.55]Probably more than we want to admit publicly.
[28:20.34]More than $10.
[28:22.54]There is a den nearby.
[28:23.80]You can choose to make it your home.
[28:26.40]Where you will raise your pups.
[28:28.46]Sure.
[28:29.64]So, where is it?
[28:32.29]It's around here somewhere.
[28:33.56]We have to find it.
[28:35.64]Yeah, it's probably around this hill, this mountain.
[28:38.92]Can we go up that mountain?
[28:41.30]Do you think you can walk up the whole thing?
[28:44.39]Oh, you see that mountain over there?
[28:46.67]You can go there.
[28:47.65]Can you, though?
[28:48.35]Forget about that joke.
[28:49.33]I mean, is it real?
[28:50.03]Is that a den?
[28:56.73]It's this pile of rocks right here.
[28:58.77]All right, make this my den.
[29:00.83]This den is some distance from the elk grounds and the nearest wolf pack.
[29:05.05]All right, so can you make that your den?
[29:08.36]Yeah.
[29:09.18]So now this is our den.
[29:12.06]Now what?
[29:13.64]Mission complete.
[29:14.36]Game over.
[29:16.32]Save your game.
[29:17.14]Mark your territory.
[29:18.78]I do that already.
[29:19.56]Mark your territory.
[29:20.66]Press P on the keyboard.
[29:28.01]Of course it's pee.
[29:35.42]Until the meter is filled.
[29:39.94]Your pups at risk?
[29:43.45]What?
[29:45.49]Our puppies are at risk?
[29:46.47]Why?
[29:46.69]There we go.
[29:47.29]Hang on.
[29:47.59]Stand still.
[29:48.05]I got it.
[29:51.35]I did that to you twice.
[29:53.65]You have twice as much pee as you than I do on you.
[29:57.85]So now what do we do?
[29:59.63]Over here?
[30:03.05]Making sure nobody gets close to my home.
[30:05.32]Do we eat grass or something?
[30:06.44]Why is there an indicator here?
[30:09.14]What's the yellow indicator for?
[30:11.38]No predators to get into my house.
[30:13.24]Yellow indicators?
[30:14.18]That's probably our territory.
[30:16.32]Or where we're supposed to hunt in.
[30:22.70]Just pee everywhere.
[30:23.50]I'm getting plus ones for peeing.
[30:24.78]I like this kind of gamification of just bodily function.
[30:29.63]Should I smell out something?
[30:32.11]No sense.
[30:34.23]I can smell you, apparently.
[30:35.39]I mean, we are the only two wolves in the game.
[30:41.21]We should have made this public, and then we'd have a hundred wolves in here.
[30:44.16]We'd make... You know what?
[30:45.00]Copy, sweet self.
[30:46.32]Don't you understand?
[30:47.14]Only, like, five people... Look, I need people to use my referral code.
[30:49.78]All right.
[30:55.20]We're going to run this way until we run into an invisible wall.
[30:57.96]You ready?
[31:00.21]Let's go.
[31:01.13]Ooh, prowl.
[31:02.45]Hydrate, hydrate.
[31:03.25]I'm fine.
[31:05.33]I'm fine.
[31:06.86]Do you just have infinite pee?
[31:08.00]How do you, uh... Do you have to drink, too?
[31:10.98]Probably, I would assume.
[31:16.42]Does pickle juice count as water?
[31:17.82]No, it's full of salt, man.
[31:19.15]Alright, this way.
[31:26.31]Follow this way.
[31:27.21]All over here.
[31:30.46]Where's the edge of the world?
[31:32.98]Found it.
[31:36.24]Whoops.
[31:36.52]See that mountain?
[31:39.54]That's my Windows XP wallpaper.
[31:41.52]I didn't think it was going to be that close.
[31:44.80]Windows XP.
[31:47.00]That didn't take very long at all.
[31:53.28]There's an animal up here, though.
[31:56.06]Come this way.
[31:58.71]Is he on the mini map?
[32:00.39]Another mini-map, the... Why does it say there's a wolf over here?
[32:05.28]If we can't even go over there.
[32:07.90]What about an elk?
[32:08.50]Do you see the elk here in the southwest?
[32:16.40]Well, you gotta make sure if you don't, you gotta sneak up on him with LT.
[32:19.85]Yeah, we've gotta get there first.
[32:26.99]Oh, wait a second.
[32:27.85]I found a hare.
[32:28.91]I'm chasing a rabbit.
[32:32.44]I just killed a rabbit.
[32:33.74]There's also a bear here.
[32:35.58]What?
[32:35.90]Why do you get to do all the fun stuff?
[32:37.70]There's a bear here and he's going to try to eat my food.
[32:40.04]I'm coming.
[32:42.24]I got to eat it first.
[32:43.98]No, kill the bear.
[32:44.70]I just made sure he would not take the... I peed on the rabbit so he wouldn't take it.
[32:51.56]Pee on the bear.
[32:54.10]Pee on the bear.
[32:55.78]I think the bear is going to try to kill me in a second.
[32:57.39]You want me to pee on the bear?
[32:59.33]Yes, piss on the bear.
[33:04.41]All right.
[33:04.73]Well, I'm getting... That did upset him slightly.
[33:08.40]But I did pee on him.
[33:08.98]I'm going to stealth pee on him.
[33:10.68]He's trying to eat my rabbit.
[33:11.92]I'm going to take him down together.
[33:14.48]I'm dead.
[33:28.31]Bye.
[33:29.07]He's going to eat real well tonight.
[33:32.69]We can't let him get away with that.
[33:34.06]We have to kill the spare.
[33:37.22]All right, respawn.
[33:38.00]You ready for the strategy?
[33:40.73]Is the strategy just keep trying until you eventually kill him because we're right here?
[33:46.85]Yeah, he's right there.
[33:47.71]All right, sneak.
[33:49.12]He's running away.
[33:49.70]Just stop fighting him.
[33:55.53]Chase away a grizzly bear.
[33:56.71]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[33:57.27]He's fast!
[33:58.39]He is fast.
[33:59.03]He's not this fast.
[34:00.35]Since when is a grizzly bear as fast?
[34:02.35]Grizzly bears are pretty fast, man.
[34:04.56]Don't let him get away.
[34:05.16]Kill him.
[34:07.44]And humiliate him.
[34:07.92]The edge of the map is this way.
[34:08.96]He just doesn't know it.
[34:11.76]Fuck.
[34:15.94]So, uh... We're doing something you may regret later.
[34:21.35]Why is it taking so long to kill him?
[34:22.21]Think about what you're doing objectively.
[34:24.95]What?
[34:27.19]Where is he?
[34:28.15]He teleported into the tree.
[34:36.40]Is there any other animals?
[34:40.70]No, we have to kill an elk.
[34:41.90]Follow me.
[34:46.10]I can't do this much longer, by the way.
[34:49.49]Uh, by this, do you mean... I mean this.
[34:54.21]Oh, I mean this.
[34:58.99]Let the record show, this was not my idea, but I was willing to entertain it.
[35:04.97]Elk hunting ground.
[35:06.53]Watch the wind direction.
[35:07.61]The elk blow away.
[35:10.45]Okay, we're in elk hunting ground.
[35:11.69]I can't do this much longer.
[35:15.88]You know what?
[35:16.36]I did hear a funny story the other day.
[35:17.70]What was it?
[35:19.86]The funny story was that the Bigfoot game actually got an update.
[35:22.72]I did hear about that too.
[35:26.46]And it's a snow update.
[35:29.40]In the wilderness of the Arctic.
[35:30.92]Why'd the music change?
[35:33.37]There's the elk.
[35:37.87]Oh, they're all... Holy shit.
[35:39.29]I thought these... There's a herd of them.
[35:40.71]I thought these were bushes.
[35:41.93]All right, let's sneak up.
[35:43.97]We're going to have to pick one.
[35:45.07]Let's go for the king in the back.
[35:46.59]If any of these get away, then we have to delete the game.
[35:48.79]But if we kill the king, then we can get all of the dough.
[35:51.02]Right, but if any of these get away, then the game has to be deleted and uninstalled.
[35:54.72]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[35:55.76]Yeah, that's a good plan.
[35:57.04]We could definitely kill all 12 of them.
[35:58.98]I think we can.
[36:00.04]Ready?
[36:02.56]They're going to be way faster than us.
[36:04.10]They can't even see us.
[36:04.74]We're stealthing.
[36:07.41]Cow elk.
[36:09.45]I think they see you.
[36:10.51]Do they?
[36:10.87]Because they're not running.
[36:11.87]I mean, they're all kind of starting to... Oh, they're fighting back.
[36:23.98]I'm almost dead.
[36:24.76]In what world is this going to be real?
[36:31.03]This one's escaping.
[36:34.16]All right, we gotta kill one.
[36:35.83]I'm almost dead.
[36:37.01]This one, come get this one.
[36:40.55]Just get right up his ass.
[36:44.50]That's the way you do it, yeah.
[36:45.56]Oh, it's gonna sound the hardest difficulty.
[36:48.08]All right, okay, now I understand.
[36:49.94]So we're playing on a literal survival mode.
[36:52.06]How do we rip him apart?
[37:24.99]What is cutting you off?
[37:28.95]Alright, keep eating.
[37:30.79]I'm gonna piss in your mouth.
[37:32.90]Whoa.
[37:34.40]Did not sign up for that.
[37:35.68]We just have to... All right.
[37:40.27]Go down to eat again.
[37:46.79]I'm out of piss.
[37:47.35]Never mind.
[37:48.59]Yeah.
[37:48.73]I'm out of piss too.
[37:49.51]Let's go.
[37:50.11]Got some back.
[37:51.99]We still have to kill 11 more.
[37:56.41]Is that the goal?
[37:58.51]Do we need that?
[37:59.07]Do we even have pups yet?
[38:00.13]We have to make some pups.
[38:01.23]Oh, bacon, bacon, bacon.
[38:02.19]Come on.
[38:02.97]Bacon, bacon, bacon.
[38:04.15]We need to go back to the den, you know?
[38:08.45]Dogs don't know it's not bacon.
[38:09.69]Oh, yeah, bacon, bacon.
[38:11.33]Bacon!
[38:12.21]It's like I think we're doing a sled.
[38:20.16]We're just on a Santa sled.
[38:22.48]How come we killed that so easily?
[38:27.81]Because there's two of us.
[38:28.55]We're a pack.
[38:29.17]We're a team.
[38:32.45]Hey, quick, get the other ones.
[38:34.59]Wait, we have a fight here coming up?
[38:40.70]Oh, what else can I do?
[38:43.44]Dogs don't know it's not bacon.
[38:44.70]It's bacon!
[38:46.59]Bacon!
[38:53.16]Are you dead?
[38:53.94]No, I'm fighting.
[39:01.48]It's a raid.
[39:03.84]Yeah, don't you know?
[39:04.42]We do this every Tuesday night.
[39:06.30]Well, it's Friday.
[39:10.44]This is just an off-rate period.
[39:12.50]We're trying to do all the content before the expansion comes out one more time.
[39:16.08]I just pissed blood all over him.
[39:19.05]We're good.
[39:23.63]I can't do it anymore.
[39:24.73]And just like that, the facade has been ripped harshly away.
[39:39.78]That had to be done.
[39:41.08]Is overcooked working?
[39:45.72]It did have to be done.
[39:46.52]I can't delete that image, though.
[39:50.43]I'm terrified to remove that image.
[39:54.14]The image?
[39:54.96]I have to keep this image on the screen.
[39:56.22]Oh, because it crashed your dream last time?
[39:58.70]Have you been playing this whole time with a fake webcam?
[40:01.12]It's a pin on the screen.
[40:04.34]We didn't even make pumps.
[40:07.76]We didn't make the pumps.
[40:09.46]We did not make pups.
[40:10.92]All right, let's try it.
[40:11.64]I feel like that was a missed opportunity.
