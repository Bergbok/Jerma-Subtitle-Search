[00:00.73]How you doing?
[00:02.95]How are we?
[00:03.55]Hold on.
[00:03.79]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:07.32]Now we're good.
[00:09.70]What's going on?
[00:12.38]Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:14.12]Officially, right?
[00:16.02]Last time I saw you, it was still December 31st, Pacific time.
[00:24.93]Catboy.
[00:25.55]Yeah, I know.
[00:26.57]I know.
[00:26.81]Look.
[00:26.97]Look.
[00:30.19]Look, I didn't tell you when I had that.
[00:33.40]I didn't say, hey guys, the next stream is going to be me in a Catboy outfit.
[00:38.80]I just said at some point over the years, over the years, I was going to get into a Catboy costume.
[00:48.57]No, it has to happen this year.
[00:49.69]Don't worry.
[00:54.71]It's going to happen in the next... Okay, I'll give you a...
[00:58.54]Look, it's going to happen in the next three to six months, okay?
[01:03.78]I didn't say I'm going to wear a Catboy costume next weekend.
[01:08.94]You won't even know when it's going to happen.
[01:12.55]It's just going to one day.
[01:14.53]And I don't want you to know the date.
[01:21.13]Scammed?
[01:25.31]Your chat is in shambles right now.
[01:32.24]But yeah, hopefully I had a good New Year's Eve.
[01:34.04]Caught you for Eastern Time, but took off around 10 or 11 p.m.
[01:38.22]Pacific.
[01:44.05]And today, we're going to do something that I haven't really done on this channel before.
[01:50.17]I mean, I've kind of done a version of it, but I saw this little device, and I had to have it.
[01:57.44]And I have to play it.
[02:00.17]This is a knockoff Nintendo.
[02:05.24]It's shaped like the Nintendo.
[02:07.20]It looks like the Nintendo.
[02:08.34]I just had to own it.
[02:11.24]There are 620 fake Nintendo games on this console.
[02:15.91]I don't know how many of them are real.
[02:18.25]I just saw this and I had to get it.
[02:23.75]I've seen Vinny do this shit before.
[02:25.75]I've seen Joel do this shit before, and these are usually a fucking mess.
[02:30.00]They are the kings of these devices, I would say.
[02:32.86]I'm just a measly peasant in their presence.
[02:36.54]So I have no idea what this one is.
[02:38.18]I just saw it and I had to buy it.
[02:46.07]Yeah, I've done the 700,000 games before, but never like one you just plug into your TV.
[02:54.88]Eat a Whopper?
[02:55.62]Tomorrow's the Whopper stream.
[02:56.64]Wait, I gotta tweak this stream mode.
[02:58.10]Hold on.
[03:00.97]Yeah, this is called the Family Computer System.
[03:05.81]Uh, yeah.
[03:06.13]Tomorrow is Whopper stream.
[03:13.84]A few weeks ago, I played that game, Black Masses, and...
[03:18.33]That joke is going to happen tomorrow.
[03:20.54]So a bunch of people probably have no idea what's going to happen with that routine in quotes.
[03:25.72]But for those of you that were there.
[03:28.56]Cool.
[03:29.02]I think I'm going to have fun.
[03:30.42]I don't even care.
[03:32.80]Oh my God.
[03:33.20]I can't fucking wait.
[03:36.64]That's going to be like my favorite stream of the year.
[03:42.47]Part of me only wants that stream to be an hour long.
[03:46.99]It's just the whole thing.
[03:49.62]But we'll see.
[03:50.28]I don't know.
[03:50.58]Let's see how much that makes me laugh.
[03:55.13]Catboy stream.
[03:56.45]Yo, get the Catboy stream.
[03:58.57]Okay, guys.
[03:59.67]Okay, let me just break this down for you.
[04:03.09]So yesterday, two days ago, it was New Year's Day.
[04:08.59]Were you expecting me to go get an entire Catboy costume and have Catboy makeup put on me in 24 hours?
[04:19.66]No, I'm doing this.
[04:20.64]I'm doing this legit.
[04:21.80]I'm not just going to go get a pair of ears at the dollar store.
[04:24.20]Okay.
[04:27.40]Just hold on.
[04:28.14]Give me some time.
[04:35.34]He's dedicated.
[04:37.82]Yeah.
[04:38.08]Well, it's going to be my version of that image.
[04:44.28]Alright.
[04:44.56]Let's go.
[04:45.16]Let's play.
[04:46.06]It's time to play.
[04:49.75]So there are, this is going to be an interesting thing we do here.
[04:51.72]I'm just going to play this the way that I'm going to play it.
[04:53.58]On the screen right now are two random number generators.
[04:58.22]Remember, there are 620 on this console.
[05:03.00]And how this is going to work is I'm going to roll this.
[05:06.13]This is just whatever this lands on.
[05:07.63]This is what I'm going to play.
[05:09.67]And whatever one this is on, this is the amount of time I have to play it in minutes.
[05:13.19]Okay.
[05:14.49]People say show the console.
[05:15.53]Sure.
[05:17.39]I'll show the family computer system.
[05:26.47]here it is is it right here can you see it not the Nintendo entertainment system the family computer system so you know uh well well hopefully this is uh hopefully this is fun I have to delay my audio by almost two and a half full seconds by the way
[05:52.20]You'll be able to stream this and capture it.
[05:54.94]So I we might be completely out of sync right now.
[05:57.52]I have no idea.
[05:58.52]I'm gonna I tried desperately.
[06:00.26]Let's test it 12345.
[06:01.90]How's that?
[06:03.92]Do I have to adjust it?
[06:14.30]123412341233.
[06:15.84]Good.
[06:16.34]Alright, let's go.
[06:17.16]Alright.
[06:17.54]Good.
[06:17.84]Good.
[06:18.05]Good.
[06:18.21]Good.
[06:18.35]Alright.
[06:18.65]So what do we got first?
[06:22.61]First one we're going to play, we're going to go to 162.
[06:24.10]And I have to play 162 for... Two minutes.
[06:27.84]Okay, good.
[06:28.06]That's good.
[06:28.30]Alright, let's go to 162.
[06:29.00]By the way, Mortal Kombat 4 with a C. That's... I mean, there's a lot here.
[06:33.22]What is it, 162?
[06:33.48]162. 162.
[06:53.16]Uh, this one's called Duck.
[06:55.57]This might be just Duck Hunt.
[06:56.55]Oh, I'll show the controller too.
[06:57.61]The controller's funny.
[06:59.57]Look at this fucking thing.
[07:02.25]So, it looks kind of normal until they decided to add like mirror buttons.
[07:05.65]So, look here.
[07:12.99]Oh, what the fuck?
[07:17.11]There's just four buttons.
[07:18.33]It's A, B, T, A, and T, B. And I tried to read the instruction manual to find out what the fuck that meant.
[07:24.75]I have no idea what that means.
[07:32.00]It gives an incredibly unclear explanation of what that actually is.
[07:37.36]Turbo?
[07:37.72]Yeah, but it doesn't do anything.
[07:40.12]Alright, let's go to Duck.
[07:40.76]Duck.
[07:42.43]It's time for Duck and I got to play this for two minutes.
[07:44.07]By the way, when I get to a point where I want to see times up spammed in chat, please.
[07:48.81]When I get the time, I probably shouldn't have told you to do that.
[07:50.64]Whatever, Duck.
[07:54.28]I already love it.
[07:59.10]It's like Dig Dug.
[08:01.76]Oh shit, I got to get these off screen.
[08:05.52]Stage one.
[08:07.10]Duck.
[08:09.66]How do you play?
[08:16.90]Did I win?
[08:17.72]Oh, you have to bring the egg to the bottom.
[08:20.13]Oh, it is like Dig Dug.
[08:22.55]Did I lose?
[08:23.07]Oh, shit.
[08:23.43]Okay, hold on.
[08:26.87]This is cute.
[08:27.73]This is not even like bad.
[08:28.82]This is like fun.
[08:33.86]What is it?
[08:34.10]Is it a dog?
[08:37.22]Is times up?
[08:38.75]It's not times up yet.
[08:43.99]Oh, the egg broke.
[08:44.71]Okay.
[08:45.31]You can't drop that far.
[08:48.10]I got one more minute.
[08:48.98]I have one minute left in duck.
[08:52.46]Alright, don't touch the green stuff.
[08:56.70]Wait, does it matter?
[08:57.18]Because it can't fall that far.
[08:59.36]Alright, let's get a heart.
[09:04.12]Oops.
[09:05.14]Oops.
[09:08.45]I didn't know Jerma was a retro gamer.
[09:10.33]Uh-oh.
[09:11.77]I think I blew it.
[09:13.41]Did I blow it?
[09:18.52]No, I'm not done with Duck yet.
[09:19.82]I'm not done.
[09:20.28]I'm not done.
[09:20.64]I'm not done.
[09:21.04]I want to get to the bottom of Duck.
[09:22.62]Hold on.
[09:24.04]I like this one.
[09:27.30]Time's up.
[09:27.86]It doesn't matter.
[09:30.05]Oh, my God.
[09:30.47]Okay, time's up.
[09:31.03]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[09:32.27]Time's up.
[09:35.34]God damn it.
[09:35.82]I wanted to play that one.
[09:36.84]Maybe I'll go back.
[09:37.42]Okay.
[09:37.64]Keep duck on the list.
[09:38.66]Alright.
[09:40.34]What's up?
[09:40.64]What's next?
[09:43.54]Alright.
[09:44.70]169 for seven minutes.
[09:49.30]169.
[09:49.78]Now that what the hell is random number generator?
[09:58.69]169 is gyrodyne.
[10:00.85]And I see right now it is almost 11 minutes.
[10:04.31]So at 18 minutes is when I have to stop playing this.
[10:06.61]This is, I probably should have made it five minutes, but whatever.
[10:09.01]I have to sleep in the bed that I made.
[10:10.13]Okay, Gyrodyne in three, two, one, go.
[10:21.12]Okay.
[10:22.84]Gyrodyne.
[10:27.08]What am I?
[10:28.14]What's going on?
[10:29.90]Oh, it's a helicopter auto-scroller.
[10:33.98]Shit.
[10:37.72]How do I kill things?
[10:38.98]I can't hurt anything?
[10:42.70]What?
[10:45.60]Why can't- why do my bullets not hurt stuff?
[10:48.60]Is it over?
[10:49.02]The gun sucks.
[10:53.89]It's like a laser tag weapon.
[10:56.45]Wait a minute.
[10:57.41]Okay, I was pressing... Wait.
[10:59.05]There's two guns.
[10:59.75]There's this one.
[11:00.35]This is just lights.
[11:01.29]And this one is real bullets.
[11:04.35]No, it's not.
[11:05.35]Oh, that's the ground.
[11:06.44]Holy shit.
[11:06.92]Okay, this is air and this is ground.
[11:10.66]Why am I shooting the cars?
[11:13.42]Oh, fuck, man.
[11:14.06]Gyrodyne's pretty good.
[11:16.02]I'm liking Gyrodyne so far.
[11:27.44]They just look like crumpled up pieces of paper.
[11:29.52]I wonder if this is a boss?
[11:37.06]I mean, this is just somebody sketched these in five seconds.
[11:39.91]I can do this.
[11:40.99]I can sketch these tanks.
[11:43.33]They're not even symmetrical either.
[11:46.45]Oh, shit.
[11:46.85]Watch out, jets.
[11:50.98]I can't fucking believe I just lost right there.
[11:54.20]God damn it.
[11:54.78]Please spawn right here.
[11:55.80]Oh my god.
[11:56.56]Wait, no, no, it's like a checkpoint.
[12:00.72]Just play Ace Combat instead.
[12:04.82]You can't really compare Gyrodyne to Ace Combat.
[12:14.85]Oh my fucking god.
[12:16.21]No!
[12:16.79]It's the control is hard.
[12:18.67]Why can't you- Why can't?
[12:20.08]Why not?
[12:23.65]Well, because... Ace Combat is a... This game was made in probably 30 minutes.
[12:30.93]Ace Combat has a team of like 200 people that worked on it for like four years.
[12:40.32]You don't just take raw hamburger meat out of the refrigerator, put it on a plate, and say, this is the same thing as the five-star restaurant.
[12:50.99]Eat my fucking hamburger meat instead.
[12:59.31]I've literally no idea what that meant, by the way.
[13:01.39]Like, I have no idea what that meant.
[13:05.66]The sentence I just said, I'm saying it internally in my head now.
[13:08.54]And the point I was trying to make is kind of there somewhere, but I don't know where it was.
[13:12.56]It was in there somewhere.
[13:14.26]If you deconstruct that whole sentence, you'll be able to find out what I was trying to say.
[13:22.81]It was in there somewhere.
[13:24.89]He zonked.
[13:25.61]No, I'm not.
[13:26.41]Not today.
[13:31.93]Stop drinking bong water.
[13:33.23]Alright, if I don't get to the end, I'm going to be very mad.
[13:36.45]This is not even hard.
[13:37.28]I played like 4,000 hours of Binding of Isaac.
[13:47.46]I can't beat Gyrodyne.
[13:54.62]I mean, the controller is kind of hard to use.
[13:57.42]Oh my god, give me a break.
[14:03.13]Fuck this game.
[14:04.47]It sucks.
[14:06.11]Never mind, it's funny.
[14:11.57]These are excuses.
[14:12.59]No, they're not.
[14:14.45]They're... Look, alright, the controller sucks!
[14:21.49]I press left and sometimes it doesn't go left.
[14:23.61]Sometimes it just sits there.
[14:24.67]Guys, they 3D printed these controllers.
[14:29.71]Like a thousand of them.
[14:36.65]It's hard to use.
[14:37.95]It's fucking hard to do.
[14:39.02]How much more time is left on this one?
[14:46.16]Two minutes?
[14:46.82]Alright, whatever.
[14:47.58]I got it.
[14:51.90]You know what?
[14:52.34]Right works fine.
[14:53.17]Up works fine.
[14:53.85]Down works fine.
[14:54.61]It's left.
[14:55.43]Left doesn't want to... You have to push hard.
[15:04.19]There's a dev in the chat.
[15:06.07]I highly doubt that.
[15:08.27]I'm trying to pick up the mermaid.
[15:09.67]And it got me killed.
[15:11.15]I can't even get past the first two screens of Gyrodyne.
[15:14.45]This is making me angry.
[15:19.94]Dev of Gyrodyne.
[15:26.73]Why am I tapping when I could just be holding?
[15:32.53]Stop pretending.
[15:36.21]I'm not pretending.
[15:37.25]It's hard.
[15:37.81]Yeah, you get on General Mills presents Gyrodyne.
[15:46.79]And you tell me how difficult it is to move around.
[16:04.53]Here we go, here we go.
[16:07.23]Watch out, watch out.
[16:10.47]Hurry, do the famous Gyrodyne cheat code.
[16:12.69]Oh, you're right.
[16:14.05]Up, up, up, down, down, down, up, up, up, down, down, down, B, A, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B, A, left, right, left, right, left, right, B, A, B, B, A, B, I, B, I, B, I, B, O, B, O, B, I, B, O, B, O, B, B, I, B, O, B. Did I get it?
[16:24.99]Nah, I was too slow.
[16:41.93]I really don't want to be playing Jaredan anymore, but you gotta follow the rules.
[16:45.27]I can't break the rules.
[16:46.35]I have to keep playing.
[16:51.96]30 seconds?
[16:52.28]Alright, this is gonna be the last life, so I better make it count.
[16:57.50]I'm just gonna dodge and not care about anything but dodging.
[17:00.94]But I move slower than they do.
[17:02.56]That's why this is so difficult.
[17:03.53]I move slower than the bullets.
[17:05.51]I move slower than all the other things.
[17:06.83]Oh, I made it.
[17:07.59]I made it.
[17:07.89]I'm good.
[17:16.94]I feel like I'm looking at like the Chrono Trigger overworld map.
[17:19.62]God, that makes me want to play that game.
[17:20.72]Let's just play that game tomorrow.
[17:22.94]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:24.04]Don't lie to them.
[17:24.88]Don't lie to them.
[17:25.38]They'll fucking snip you out.
[17:26.48]Don't lie to them.
[17:33.70]Where are these cars driving?
[17:34.98]Why are they driving up here?
[17:39.22]Off road, I guess.
[17:40.38]Alright, it's- Oh, I made it.
[17:41.26]It's the first time I've ever been in Gyro 9.
[17:45.64]I can't even see the bullets.
[17:50.12]Wow, it looks so much better on your guy's screen.
[17:51.84]I'm not even kidding.
[17:52.83]From my monitor, it looks like dog shit.
[17:54.37]But on your screen, it looks wicked good.
[17:58.07]On my screen, it looks like shit.
[18:00.09]When it's- Why is that?
[18:01.77]How can your screen look so much better than my screen?
[18:07.69]Whatever.
[18:08.37]No, it really does.
[18:08.97]I couldn't see those bullets.
[18:10.51]I looked over at my preview monitor.
[18:11.79]I could see them clearly.
[18:12.49]And what do we got next?
[18:14.51]That was Gyrodyne.
[18:17.03]It was pretty sick.
[18:19.58]There we go.
[18:20.52]$2.99 for three minutes.
[18:23.22]Okay, I can do that.
[18:24.02]$2.99?
[18:29.04]Pong Pong for three minutes.
[18:37.00]Alright, let's play Pong Pong.
[18:41.64]I'm going to start the 1930.
[18:43.32]Let's start.
[18:46.40]And I'm going to guess this is Pong.
[18:49.10]If it's not Pong, then I don't know what it is.
[18:52.20]Pong Pong stage one.
[18:53.54]What the fuck is happening?
[19:02.33]Am I driving my car?
[19:03.29]OK, I'm orange car.
[19:07.08]Do I have bullets or guns or anything?
[19:08.60]Is it just bumper cars?
[19:11.34]Wait a minute.
[19:11.74]Is this just a Mario Party game?
[19:13.18]Where you have to bump, like, Yoshi and Luigi off the edge?
[19:21.01]I think that's what this is.
[19:27.39]I don't... I don't know what the goal is.
[19:33.04]I have to just dump them into the corners.
[19:40.52]No fucking idea, man.
[19:44.28]What if I drive into one?
[19:48.18]Oh, I was killed.
[19:49.61]But I can't... Look, when I bump into them, they don't go the direction you think they're gonna go.
[19:53.39]This doesn't make any fucking sense.
[19:57.79]I don't have any bullets or anything either.
[20:07.49]See?
[20:07.87]Like, you think they would bounce backwards.
[20:11.85]I'm... I go from much... Why did I switch with him?
[20:20.27]What the... What?
[20:21.19]How is that even fucking possible?
[20:23.32]What?
[20:25.28]We switched places.
[20:30.78]Get in there.
[20:31.48]Oh, I didn't have to do... Wait, there's two more left.
[20:44.27]Hey, Jerma, I'm the dev of... What is this?
[20:45.91]Honestly, I don't even care what's happening in the game right now.
[20:48.19]I'm going to read this.
[20:50.81]Hey, I'm the dev of Gyrodyne.
[20:51.95]This game was the work of two years of work with myself and another dev.
[20:54.19]He ended up with my wife and I lost custody of my children.
[20:56.51]Okay, well...
[21:07.63]I'm the dev of Gyarada.
[21:08.92]Alright, I don't even care.
[21:09.92]How much time is left?
[21:11.42]19, 20, 21, 22.
[21:12.52]I have like 40 seconds.
[21:25.22]This is by far the worst mode yet.
[21:26.54]This is the worst mode yet.
[21:28.77]I cannot bump them.
[21:29.55]When I get close enough, I switch places with them.
[21:37.11]2230, right?
[21:37.69]Alright, I don't even care.
[21:39.19]I'm just going to wait.
[21:40.83]I don't even know what pong.
[21:42.89]Ping pong?
[21:44.03]Pong pong.
[21:47.27]Worst two out of three.
[21:48.13]Alright, let's go.
[21:48.71]What do we got?
[21:53.74]Coming up next is 223 for five minutes.
[22:02.21]Just get rid of the timer.
[22:04.23]That was not three minutes.
[22:04.93]Yeah, it was.
[22:06.77]19, 20, 21, 22.
[22:07.04]Alright, 2.23 for five minutes.
[22:12.86]Don't get rid of the timer.
[22:15.06]I'm just gonna, I'll leave it for now.
[22:16.14]There's like 600 games.
[22:17.14]I figured we'd do something interesting for the first like hour or two.
[22:20.84]Alright, 2.23.
[22:25.70]Is Spy versus, I want to play Spy versus Spy right now. 2.23.
[22:31.93]It's called five days.
[22:33.61]I'll have five minutes to do five days.
[22:42.47]So we're at, I'm looking at the stream time right now.
[22:44.64]We're at 23 minutes and just about 30 seconds.
[22:46.70]So five minutes from right now, five days.
[22:51.16]Okay.
[22:53.22]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[23:01.24]Okay, I'm just shooting.
[23:02.71]I can't really aim at them.
[23:05.43]I feel like this is how I end up playing XCOM.
[23:14.37]Oh my fucking god.
[23:15.51]Okay.
[23:20.89]I can't shoot them at an angle.
[23:22.13]I have to do this for five full days?
[23:30.73]How come I just turned them green?
[23:34.10]I can't even aim that direction.
[23:35.60]I can only aim at specific angles.
[23:46.56]I'm not doing that bad.
[23:47.32]This music is driving me fucking crazy.
[24:02.21]I feel like I'm playing like an old Nintendo scary horror game like Maniac Mansion and the title screen glitched out and it's just repeating.
[24:12.91]The CD just is skipping.
[24:20.89]Oh, wait, this guy's red, orange.
[24:26.46]He was one hit.
[24:28.16]Is he just faster?
[24:33.46]This is penis music.
[24:37.56]No.
[24:37.90]Alright.
[24:45.96]I'm done.
[24:46.98]This is stupid.
[24:53.48]Stop.
[24:53.82]I'm done with this one.
[24:55.68]I don't even care.
[24:56.76]I don't care.
[24:57.40]I can't take this one anymore.
[24:58.30]I don't care.
[25:02.93]Now, where are we going next?
[25:03.55]The timer.
[25:05.91]No, the ti- Yeah, fuck the timer.
[25:07.63]The timer is- I don't care.
[25:09.33]Broke the rules already?
[25:10.09]I don't even care.
[25:10.68]Like, fuck the timer.
[25:11.44]If it sucks, I don't want to burn my brain.
[25:16.28]Seven minutes.
[25:20.20]Alright, 397 is... What is it?
[25:24.38]You have to follow the rules. 397.
[25:29.24]Dr. Mario.
[25:30.65]This is a classic.
[25:31.53]This actually might just be Dr. Mario, by the way.
[25:34.75]So do not be surprised if it's just... They just ripped it and put it on here.
[25:40.34]They did.
[25:42.12]I think.
[25:44.06]Virus level.
[25:46.02]Speed.
[25:46.80]Music type.
[25:50.40]Um, okay.
[25:52.14]I have a confession to make for all of you watching.
[25:55.01]I have no idea how to play Dr. Mario.
[25:57.55]I don't even- I don't understand it.
[25:58.91]I don't get it at all.
[25:59.75]I don't- I've never played it more than five seconds at a time.
[26:05.45]I have to match, like, the colors right somehow, and you get rid of the aliens.
[26:14.10]I think that's how you play.
[26:18.84]And then I can attach it to here and then kill, right?
[26:22.36]Is this the game?
[26:22.86]Is this actually Dr. Mario?
[26:24.39]Or is it like a weird bootleg version of it?
[26:28.91]Um, oops.
[26:31.51]There you go.
[26:32.09]That's the fucking best gamer moment.
[26:33.28]Fucking 2020 moment right there if you've ever seen one.
[26:37.70]I have to attach this to... Oops.
[26:39.50]Oh, I fucked it up.
[26:40.12]It's over.
[26:46.87]What am I- Oh my god.
[26:48.02]I can't- I hate these kind of games.
[26:52.68]I can't- I do not like Tetris style games.
[26:55.36]I can't do them.
[26:57.54]I get so impatient because the thing goes so slow.
[26:59.56]It just trickles down like one, two, three.
[27:01.64]But I'm like, hurry, get the fuck down there.
[27:03.21]I have to like think on the fly.
[27:06.29]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:07.41]I don't want to do that.
[27:15.33]Oh, fuck.
[27:15.79]I'm in trouble.
[27:18.76]No, I can't.
[27:19.24]I can't do it.
[27:19.66]Gotta go fast.
[27:20.26]There's no car I can drive.
[27:21.24]I don't like it.
[27:22.92]I don't like it.
[27:23.58]There's no car to drive.
[27:24.26]I don't like it.
[27:24.62]I'm so impatient.
[27:26.62]I'm so fucked up.
[27:27.26]I can't do it.
[27:27.72]I'm too fucked up to play these games.
[27:29.38]I can't do it.
[27:34.83]I can't do it.
[27:35.37]I'm too fucked.
[27:39.45]This is why I got like an F in geometry and shit like every year.
[27:42.21]I can't play these games.
[27:45.82]But I can sing though, okay?
[27:48.92]That's worth something.
[27:52.18]Fuck, I'm so screwed.
[27:56.21]Can you imagine being in, like, junior high school or high school or something?
[28:02.61]And you get your test back from the teacher and they're like, oh, Jeremy, yeah, you didn't, like, you messed this all up.
[28:08.61]You didn't, like, do this correctly.
[28:10.41]The angles are all wrong.
[28:12.49]Maybe could you come after class?
[28:13.55]Maybe, like, we could do some tutoring.
[28:15.23]Excuse me, teacher, I can sing, though.
[28:21.57]That's how you get to the office.
[28:27.11]Oh, I can sing though.
[28:27.93]Okay, teacher's like, I don't care.
[28:29.65]Cool.
[28:30.21]That's like great.
[28:32.01]I'll get it this time.
[28:36.47]What a horrible excuse for every scenario.
[28:42.02]Mr. Elbertson, just want to let you know your blood pressure is a little high and your cholesterol is a little high too.
[28:46.62]Hey doc, I can sing though.
[28:49.57]Okay.
[28:50.53]Uh, good.
[28:51.63]Good.
[28:53.21]Start eating Cheerios and stop ordering fucking hamburgers from Uber Eats every day.
[29:02.06]I've made no progress.
[29:03.12]What's happening?
[29:08.57]What happened?
[29:11.25]But I don't understand, like, what you're supposed to do in Dr. Mario.
[29:13.55]I get the concept, but, like, I don't...
[29:16.63]I don't care.
[29:17.31]Like, you know when you just don't care?
[29:19.91]And that's why you can't do it?
[29:20.89]Because I just don't care.
[29:21.71]You know what I mean?
[29:24.95]Some of you guys, like, you, like, you statisticians and shit are looking at this going like, oh, man, he's, he's, like, wait, he could have put the red over there.
[29:30.42]He could have put the blue over there.
[29:31.22]The blue could have gone over that way.
[29:33.52]I don't care.
[29:33.90]I can sing.
[29:36.30]I'm done.
[29:36.56]88.
[29:44.57]What's 88?
[29:53.52]Uh, Bomberman.
[29:54.96]Okay.
[29:55.48]So it's Bomberman.
[29:57.31]For a maximum amount of... Alright, no.
[30:00.51]Fuck this timer.
[30:00.97]I don't even care.
[30:01.71]Let's play it until I don't care anymore.
[30:04.49]Bomberman.
[30:09.90]Is it actual Bomberman?
[30:12.48]Let's see.
[30:15.60]Um... Kind of.
[30:20.02]I want to say kind of.
[30:27.68]Is this what the original one looks like?
[30:34.87]Is it dead?
[30:38.93]This is what the original game looks like, is it?
[30:41.18]I don't think I've ever played the original.
[30:48.08]This is actually literally just Bomberman.
[30:50.02]Is it?
[30:50.24]Oh, holy shit.
[30:54.84]Cool.
[31:00.99]This one's fun.
[31:01.65]I like Bomberman.
[31:03.15]You know, I used to play Bomberman 64.
[31:05.71]And Bomberman 64 had a very surprisingly fun party game mode where you could have like four people.
[31:12.58]It was like a battle system.
[31:14.00]It was awesome.
[31:20.44]Come on, go.
[31:23.66]Get him.
[31:28.20]I just didn't kill myself, did I?
[31:33.62]Okay, good.
[31:38.14]Oh, why are you avoiding me so well?
[31:43.65]There it is.
[31:43.97]Got him.
[31:45.11]Oh my god.
[31:45.65]This guy sucks at Bomberman.
[31:48.01]That's who cares.
[31:51.29]Does that really matter?
[31:52.15]Okay, in the year 2020.
[31:53.55]Does it matter if I can't do the original Bomberman very well?
[31:58.10]I'm gonna die.
[32:11.63]It's 22, whatever.
[32:12.68]It's been two days.
[32:18.64]You have a certain amount of time to be able to say it's 2012.
[32:23.05]You get some leeway there.
[32:24.05]It's been two days.
[32:25.01]336.
[32:25.03]What's 336?
[32:35.94]It's been three days.
[32:36.60]Yeah, but whatever.
[32:37.44]It's been three days.
[32:38.60]Some people are like, oh yeah, man, still saying 2020.
[32:40.52]Shit.
[32:41.26]People still do that shit in March.
[32:42.98]Okay.
[32:45.90]How many times people, when they sign in somewhere or they write something and they have to look up to the clerk or look up to the cashier and go, uh, I don't have any idea what today is or what day it is, what time it is.
[32:57.08]And the person has to go, oh, it's, um, yeah, it's one for 2021.
[33:03.62]Guys, every single time I filled out a piece of paper where there was a clerk in front of me, they had to tell me what the date was every single time.
[33:10.12]I never know what date is.
[33:13.18]And sometimes they have to tell me twice.
[33:15.83]Because they'll say that, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, 4-5-2020.
[33:18.79]Oh, yeah, yeah, cool, thank you.
[33:21.71]And I fill out the paper and then I have to go, 4-5-2020.
[33:25.21]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you.
[33:29.35]Oh, yeah, that's what I thought.
[33:32.85]So, come on.
[33:33.47]This is a battleship.
[33:42.20]Oh, is this actually, is this the real battleship?
[33:43.96]Where you have to, like, guess where, uh, where people's boats are and stuff?
[33:49.62]I told you this already.
[33:51.30]You know, I talked about, like, the next Twitch thing.
[33:53.62]Let me call it for you.
[33:54.83]I'm calling it for you right now.
[33:55.87]We had, like, there was all kinds of different trends on Twitch, right, over the last few years.
[34:01.99]Among Us.
[34:03.23]Chess was huge for a while.
[34:05.43]Rust is getting big right now.
[34:07.01]The next one's going to be Battleship.
[34:08.41]It's going to be fucking Battleship.
[34:09.67]There will be huge drama around Battleship.
[34:14.35]Within the next six months.
[34:15.33]I guarantee it.
[34:17.91]100% guarantee it.
[34:23.20]You come to me.
[34:24.10]You come to me.
[34:26.22]When I'm correct.
[34:27.24]I don't care.
[34:27.56]It doesn't matter how long it is.
[34:28.54]It could be six months.
[34:32.17]And you want the absolute best tip for Battleship?
[34:34.05]Put every single boat right next to each other in the exact same corner.
[34:47.40]Your friends will sit all over that top left part of the map and be like, I have no fucking idea where this dude is.
[34:56.02]Here we go.
[34:56.66]Alright.
[34:57.28]Where are they?
[34:57.84]That's right here.
[34:58.98]Ooh, you... Did I miss?
[35:04.79]You're not going to find shit.
[35:06.23]Oh, I don't know where it is.
[35:07.35]Over here, dude?
[35:08.19]Nope, wrong.
[35:09.35]You'll get it wrong every time.
[35:10.23]How about right here?
[35:14.51]Oh, bear just missed.
[35:19.77]You're never going to find it.
[35:26.12]Okay, what about... What if he's doing the same thing?
[35:29.00]Did I get it?
[35:30.70]Is that a hit?
[35:32.64]No.
[35:37.82]Either this strategy or all four corners is the best strategy, because people just don't think you're ever going to do that.
[35:44.52]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that?
[35:53.11]What is this?
[35:53.51]Why does he have a four shot?
[35:59.26]Um, excuse me, that's not fair.
[36:03.34]And where's mine that shoots four times?
[36:11.34]ridiculous why did he get that that's absolutely unfair that was a hit okay that's a hit I know where he is yeah good luck finding the rest of them see right now he's oh right he can do basic math
[36:36.34]Yeah, but that's so unfair you found me because you had the four shooter.
[36:39.75]That's unbelievable.
[36:41.67]He's doing the same thing This would have taken him at least four or five more turns Alright, that's one destroyer I sunk the destroyer Alright, so I'm technically in the lead
[37:07.72]I hope he's doing the exact same strat.
[37:10.20]Aw, damn it.
[37:14.40]Pre-recorded?
[37:15.10]What?
[37:15.34]What are you talking about?
[37:22.97]Um... I'm gonna say right here.
[37:24.79]Oh, shit.
[37:29.97]Is it gonna be close?
[37:33.71]But the computer has a bunch of algorithms inside of its head.
[37:36.71]It can do that math.
[37:38.59]A human does not.
[37:39.59]A human has no idea what's going on.
[37:44.84]And then by the time they figure it out, they look up at you from across the table.
[37:49.32]They're like, dude, no, you did not do that.
[37:52.68]No, you didn't.
[37:55.48]And I said to him, Pepe laughed.
[37:57.80]Oh, you didn't?
[37:58.38]No, I did.
[37:58.90]Dude, no, you didn't.
[38:07.45]This computer knows where these are because it's literally doing a math problem right now to know where these are.
[38:18.43]Music's a banger.
[38:19.16]Yeah, this is pretty good.
[38:21.24]Okay, but he technically doesn't know where the other one is.
[38:33.18]Right here.
[38:34.58]Nope.
[38:36.20]He does?
[38:36.84]No, but he can't.
[38:37.54]He doesn't know.
[38:38.10]It's still going to take him... It's over.
[38:43.40]I lose.
[38:45.33]No, no, no.
[38:45.61]That was the... Can we stop talking about how bad I am at Battleship and start talking about how unbelievable it is that he got to shoot four times in one turn?
[39:02.40]We're not talking about that.
[39:09.91]You can change your weapon.
[39:12.77]Um... I... How?
[39:17.95]Press select.
[39:26.56]Oh my god, what?
[39:31.66]Why?
[39:33.18]Mine's even better.
[39:41.26]I missed all of them, but whatever.
[39:43.82]It doesn't matter.
[39:44.36]Because you know where to come.
[39:48.06]You know who to talk to.
[39:50.49]When all the top streamers are going back and forth in huge drama on Battleship.
[40:03.23]You missed all.
[40:05.86]It doesn't matter.
[40:06.32]Whatever.
[40:06.92]Who cares.
[40:07.26]Next.
[40:07.48]Next.
[40:10.44]Lost in 20 turns.
[40:12.68]Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
[40:14.58]Oh, I pressed it's number 10.
[40:16.96]Sorry, I pressed it before you could see it.
[40:18.23]10 is RoboCop 4.
[40:20.31]We're going to skip RoboCop 1, 2, and 3.
[40:22.89]Okay, that's fine.
[40:26.37]RoboCop 4.
[40:26.87]In 1992.
[40:26.99]1992 presents...
[40:39.61]The year.
[40:40.27]A production.
[40:41.35]Of some sort.
[40:42.65]This was made somehow.
[40:44.63]Robocop.
[40:46.07]With a baby.
[40:47.87]Or a child.
[40:48.95]What?
[40:49.15]Why does the child have a machine gun?
[40:52.27]Wait.
[40:52.95]What the fuck?
[40:59.60]Okay.
[41:02.14]Uh.
[41:04.48]Let's play?
[41:05.52]How come I can't.
[41:07.08]I can't press any buttons.

[51:41.07]And I mean really at all.
[51:43.49]Never was, even when I was younger.
[51:44.83]This game came out when I was a kid.
[51:48.16]This was a big deal when this came out.
[51:50.36]I remember.
[51:50.70]Everyone was obsessed with it.
[51:53.06]Not me.
[51:55.42]I don't care at all about this.
[52:01.16]It's classic.
[52:01.74]I have to respect it, right?
[52:02.65]Because, I mean, come on.
[52:03.19]It's a classic.
[52:04.35]It's like, that's like what you can't, but you're going to hate Donkey Kong?
[52:06.69]How?
[52:06.97]You can't.
[52:12.99]I just like the way that looks.
[52:13.81]That's why I did that.

[64:13.29]Oh, you're in a helicopter.
[64:19.15]This one's going to make me sick.
[64:20.67]This one makes me sick.
[64:21.35]I have to stop right now.
[64:22.67]I'm done.
[64:23.03]I'm done.
[64:23.39]I'm done.
[64:23.65]I'm done.
[64:23.89]I'm done.
[64:24.47]Off, off, off, off, off, off.
[64:25.73]Time's up.
[64:34.64]Nope.
[64:36.06]Not happen.
[64:38.06]That one is just instant headache.
[64:39.48]Number four.
[64:39.98]We get to play Contra 6.
[64:43.68]Alright, I'm gonna... Why do they do this, by the way?
[64:50.98]Is there a reason why there's a link?
[64:55.99]Why does it have to be just numbered Contras?
[64:59.47]What's the link?
[65:02.93]Win a battleship match for 1 billion off the debt.
[65:05.45]Lose the match and 1 extra day of Catboy.
[65:08.45]Excuse me.
[65:10.41]No.
[65:11.25]No.
[65:11.77]Excuse me.
[65:12.37]No deal.
[65:15.97]No deal.
[65:16.39]I can't make deals like that unless I can... Alright, Contra 6.
[65:23.57]Super Contra 6.
[65:24.85]This is Neo City 1992.
[65:26.02]A lot of these take place in 1992.
[65:30.87]Hi.
[65:31.79]It's me, Fox.
[65:32.81]Is that you, Burns?
[65:36.32]Yeah.
[65:38.42]The head of intelligence is in serious trouble.
[65:43.32]We need your help.
[65:44.64]Okay.
[65:47.82]I'll be in the old warehouse at the edge of the harbor.
[65:57.39]Fox!
[65:59.86]Now we must eliminate you, Burns.
[66:04.64]Wait, Burns as in like, was that a fire?
[66:06.94]Wait, what's going on?
[66:13.75]Player select.
[66:18.45]Hey, Contra, Rambo, Guile, Ryu, or Bill.
[66:25.36]Oh boy, oh boy.
[66:30.54]They couldn't put anybody else here?
[66:32.40]I mean, it kind of has to, but Bill looks like he has shitty equipment.
[66:38.19]Bill has a pistol, a Roomba, and a can of fucking Bud Light.
[66:45.45]I don't think Bill's gonna be very good.
[66:49.47]Everybody else has, like, machine guns and flamethrowers.
[66:51.39]Alright, I'll play Bill.
[66:52.82]Bill.
[66:53.00]Let's go, Bill.
[67:00.85]And it just is Contra, but not somehow.
[67:05.05]Bottom of the screen is just blinking.
[67:09.96]Rambo.
[67:15.02]Copyright don't matter.
[67:16.24]It really doesn't.
[67:24.68]If I made a game right now that was called Contra 6...
[67:29.21]And I sold it on Steam and Rambo was the main character.
[67:32.17]How quickly would that get removed from Steam?
[67:35.13]Why am I fighting a tractor?
[67:39.20]What?
[67:40.62]Why does this thing have a mind?
[67:41.72]It's a forklift.
[67:50.62]Yeah, but there's nobody in it.
[67:53.68]What?
[67:54.38]Bullshit.
[67:57.78]Why am I going so, holy shit, I'm going so slow.
[68:00.84]Give me a fucking break.
[68:01.84]Alright, just damage boost through it.
[68:03.62]Ooh, alright, we're good.
[68:05.44]What?
[68:07.00]Yep, I knew you were going to spawn a guy right in front of me.
[68:12.85]Yeah, I was pretty good at Contra when I was younger.
[68:14.25]Hey, what's the best Contra?
[68:17.37]Eh, time's up.
[68:17.99]It's Contra 3 for Super Nintendo.
[68:19.35]You got it wrong, sorry.
[68:25.04]What?
[68:26.54]Excuse me.
[68:26.98]Okay, it even has the regular Nintendo slowdown.
[68:43.19]I gotta get more.
[68:43.73]Okay, there we go.
[68:44.77]That's better.
[68:45.17]Can I land on that?
[68:51.10]Can I step on that?
[69:02.24]I want to see what Contra 5 is like.
[69:03.94]Let's see if it's any different.
[69:05.78]There is no 5.
[69:06.52]There's 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8.
[69:07.92]Let's do Contra 3.
[69:13.57]This is the best Contra, so let's see.
[69:15.83]This one takes place in Neo City 2100.
[69:17.55]Neo City's been around for a long time.
[69:18.95]That was in 1992.
[69:19.57]It was the first Neo City.
[69:21.87]Wait.
[69:23.01]Hey, it's me, Fox.
[69:24.47]Is that you, Burns?
[69:26.07]Wait, the hell?
[69:27.67]Yeah!
[69:29.54]The head of intelligence is in serious trouble.
[69:34.30]We need your help.
[69:35.78]Wait, this is like 200 years in the future.
[69:38.96]What?
[69:39.18]Okay, I'll be in the old warehouse at the edge of the harbor.
[69:44.49]There must always be a fox and there must always be a Burns.
[69:48.57]Fox.
[69:50.57]No, we must... That's just my face.
[70:09.72]It's the same exact game with just different people.
[70:14.67]It's the same game.
[70:15.33]There's no difference at all.
[70:18.51]Okay, I want to look at all the conscious.
[70:20.31]I want to see all the copyright characters they put in.
[70:23.99]Dude, don't be surprised if like fucking Mario is on one of these.
[70:29.76]I really wouldn't be surprised if, I don't know, if like Ross from Friends was on here too.
[70:35.65]Cookie Monster might even be on here.
[70:37.95]It could be anybody.
[70:50.94]Okay, I don't even care.
[70:52.38]I just want to know who the other characters are.
[70:53.66]I want to see the cutscene.
[70:54.28]Let's go to Contra 1.
[70:59.12]We've seen 3 and we've seen 6.
[71:00.66]Let's see what Contra 1 is.
[71:01.72]Uh...
[71:05.95]Wait, what?
[71:09.09]So inside of the Contra 1 folder was like Contra 2 through 8.
[71:12.24]This is just how a ton of folders on my desktop are right now.
[71:17.90]It's just poor folder management.
[71:21.21]Okay, we're going to do Contra 2.
[71:23.21]Contra 2.
[71:28.50]Contra 1 folder into subdirectory Contra 2.
[71:31.74]Now, this is just Contra.
[71:35.20]A 100% rip.
[71:36.63]Completely, I would say, absolutely fucking against the law.
[71:39.25]Completely illegal.
[71:39.87]This is Contra 1.
[71:42.01]Okay, whatever.
[71:46.27]I guess that's what this is.
[71:47.93]Contra 1.
[71:49.04]No, it's not.
[71:50.08]Wait, why do I have a spreader automatically?
[71:54.64]This is like level 3 in Contra 1, but I have upgraded weapon.
[72:06.48]Um, is that it?
[72:07.82]Oh, okay.
[72:16.00]And they made it really simple!
[72:17.18]They gave you the spreader!
[72:22.62]Why would you do this?
[72:26.01]It's just different scenes from Contra 1.
[72:29.51]So, am I correct when I think that when they say Contra 2, they mean level 2 in Contra 1?
[72:35.83]We need to investigate a little further here.
[72:37.17]This is gonna take some full investigation.
[72:52.96]He's so smart.
[72:54.10]Hey, thanks man.
[72:58.95]You know what a boss used to scare the shit out of me in Contra?
[73:02.58]It was the boss in, I believe it was, this exact same kind of style.
[73:07.56]The Super Contra, right?
[73:09.32]Like that weird skeleton guy that hangs around the room.
[73:13.38]When he jumps down, he hangs from the ceiling and shit.
[73:15.33]And then his face pops out of the middle.
[73:19.23]And Super Contra was terrifying.
[73:20.51]It made... Every time you fought a boss, it played this horrible, scary music.
[73:28.35]It was like...
[73:31.84]There's like fucking bosses coming in.
[73:33.90]It's scary.
[73:41.21]Kill it.
[73:50.84]I forgot how fun these games were.
[73:54.27]You know what the sad part about this?
[73:56.31]I'm going to say something right now and you guys can tell me.
[73:58.07]Oh, no, no, no.
[73:58.59]Yeah, that's right, dude.
[73:59.33]That happened already.
[74:01.57]Is it too bad that I would love a new Contra, but the one definitely came out that was an iPad pay-to-win game probably, right?
[74:09.23]I'm sure they redid Contra for iOS.
[74:11.05]It was probably just complete dog shit pay-to-win weird shitty game or something, right?
[74:19.76]That's so sad.
[74:20.54]I feel like that would be the thing.
[74:23.56]Alright, stage three, waterfall.
[74:25.64]I have 26 lives.
[74:30.35]26 lives?
[74:32.49]Was this in control?
[74:34.87]I don't remember any of this.
[74:39.31]I don't remember this being in the game.
[74:41.14]Did I ever never get this far as a kid?
[74:43.98]Alright, I want to investigate.
[74:52.84]Contra 1.
[74:54.56]Okay, so that was Contra 2.
[74:56.41]Here's Contra 3.
[74:57.05]Okay, it's definitely just the level select.
[75:03.91]Yeah, it's the level select.
[75:05.09]Yeah, of course it is.
[75:05.99]Oh my fucking god.
[75:06.79]So what's the other ones then?
[75:11.01]So if that's that, so what is Contra 30p?
[75:15.43]Shotgun?
[75:16.53]What's shotgun?
[75:21.57]Letting you start with the shotgun.
[75:32.50]That's so dumb.
[75:34.62]Okay.
[75:37.66]It's just a game shark.
[75:39.18]Okay.
[75:40.02]No, no, no.
[75:40.24]I don't want to do Contras.
[75:41.36]No, stop doing Contras.
[75:44.60]12 in 1.
[75:46.72]So bogus.
[75:48.16]Click the link.
[75:48.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[75:49.55]What's this link?
[75:51.02]And we click the link.
[75:51.64]Okay.
[75:55.75]It's pretty good.
[75:57.09]It's pretty good.
[75:59.83]Not bad.
[76:01.15]It's not bad.
[76:02.03]It's pretty good.
[76:08.86]By the way, that is 805.
[76:09.46]806.
[76:09.48]See?
[76:09.66]I can read that today.
[76:21.85]How come it's not showing up?
[76:25.99]There it is.
[76:37.79]Alright, let's go.
[76:38.23]I want to see what Contra 2 is.
[76:39.01]It's just a debug menu.
[76:51.32]Alright, Contra 30 S, Contra 4 A. This is not, wait, that's not Contra.
[77:01.89]Super what?
[77:02.45]Arena 4, play.
[77:06.93]Is this Contra?
[77:13.23]It is.
[77:20.71]So this is just Contra 2.
[77:23.27]But Contra 3 is not Contra 3.
[77:25.83]It's a made-up Contra 3.
[77:29.21]So what would Contra 6 or 7 be?
[77:31.14]I don't know what's going on.
[77:42.10]Not bad.
[77:45.53]Alright.
[77:46.45]I need to see.
[77:49.85]So if that's Contra 2, we've seen Contra 6.
[77:52.99]What is Contra 7?
[77:54.07]Super Contra 7.
[78:05.03]I hope Fox... I hope Burns is in trouble.
[78:10.76]Oh, this is definitely a made-up one.
[78:13.60]Uh...
[78:18.40]You can tell because how badly this one runs.
[78:20.94]And I can't even pick this item up.
[78:24.77]It's just a ROM hack of the first one.
[78:29.37]All the enemy spawning is just so wrong and off.
[78:36.01]Two room sale.
[78:39.43]Look at this enemy spawning.
[78:44.31]Oto- Oto- Oto-Totel.
[78:48.19]Oto-Totel.
[78:49.95]Oto-Totel.
[78:52.39]What is that trying to say?
[79:02.42]Sail, sail, sail.
[79:04.88]Everything's on sail.
[79:05.84]The whole world is on sail.
[79:09.36]The Otto-Hotel.
[79:10.46]Oh, it's Otto-Totel.
[79:13.23]Love you.
[79:14.42]Love you.
[79:15.02]Love you.
[79:15.70]Love you.
[79:22.42]Two room.
[79:24.18]I think two room is my favorite.
[79:26.60]Although auto-totale is probably... This is impossible to play, by the way.
[79:31.12]This is impossible.
[79:32.83]And if you noticed, we have not made any progress.
[79:35.87]We keep doing the exact same screens.
[79:38.59]This is never ending.
[79:39.21]If you just keep walking to the right, it's the same thing.
[79:45.85]Okay, what's Contra 8?
[79:54.70]Here we go.
[79:58.57]It's somehow just worse font version of the last one.
[80:02.33]In fact, it's pasted over.
[80:04.56]It's superimposed over the last one.
[80:14.02]Let's just paste it on.
[80:16.06]Okay, let's see.
[80:17.13]Same exact game.
[80:17.91]No difference at all.
[80:26.73]And what's with this music?
[80:30.22]I feel like I only have like 100 seconds left in any old Nintendo game.
[80:36.94]Oh, hurry up!
[80:50.89]If you slowed this down, it might actually be like a good Nintendo, like regular Nintendo song.
[80:59.00]I'm done.
[80:59.32]I'm done with this.
[80:59.94]It's over.
[81:00.36]Oh, that was Super Crunch 8.
[81:01.08]Alright, now where are we going?
[81:06.58]I mean, let's do the Robocop.
[81:08.34]Fuck it.
[81:08.66]Whatever.
[81:10.04]We saw Robocop 4.
[81:11.00]Let's do Robocop 1.
[81:13.32]License from Ocean Software.
[81:14.62]Is that a real company?
[81:15.86]The future of law enforcement.
[81:21.18]Nice.
[81:22.32]Load up that gun.
[81:24.02]Same exact thing.
[81:26.91]Arrest mode.
[81:27.95]Second Street.
[81:29.39]Nash Avenue.
[81:30.93]Crime in progress.
[81:36.23]Oh, it's different.
[81:36.95]It's a different game.
[81:38.09]Okay, there's a punch.
[81:41.51]I just have a punch.
[81:42.21]I don't have anything else.
[81:44.09]Select doesn't do anything.
[81:45.63]Okay.
[81:48.27]Are these just... Who are these people?
[81:54.75]Okay, that's not fair.
[81:58.35]I don't have nothing.
[81:59.55]Select is blocked.
[82:03.25]Start doesn't do anything.
[82:05.91]All the buttons don't do anything.
[82:08.95]That person just dropkicked out of the fucking window and hit me.
[82:12.17]That was incredibly impressive.
[82:13.68]That was unbelievable.
[82:15.84]That was insane.
[82:18.08]Oh yeah, I didn't even hit him.
[82:18.90]He missed and he died.
[82:25.54]I want to go up.
[82:26.60]It's Castlevania.
[82:33.67]Oh my god.
[82:36.13]Off the top rope?
[82:37.15]I can't even go down.
[82:37.83]I don't understand how I still have a gun that I can't use.
[82:47.09]Oh.
[82:48.07]He decided to take out the gun.
[82:49.70]It's scripted.
[82:50.90]Wait, what?
[82:54.60]I just shot a dog.
[83:04.76]I hate that sound.
[83:05.62]I don't like that.
[83:06.30]I don't want to hear that.
[83:06.94]I don't like that.
[83:09.28]Why are there so many fucking rabid dogs?
[83:22.91]Why am I aiming like this, too?
[83:24.15]Um, okay.
[83:26.29]Here's what's going on right now.
[83:28.15]Uh, this game, they had some kind of model.
[83:30.63]This is pulling back a bow and arrow.
[83:33.11]And they just didn't care to change it.
[83:34.12]This is a different model for some other game that they made, probably.
[83:36.36]And it's pulling back a bow and arrow.
[83:40.60]What on Earth is that?
[83:41.48]It's like Dr. Robotnik, okay.
[83:43.88]Uh...
[83:57.81]Data East.
[84:01.35]Got him in the air.
[84:02.60]Alright, I made it through.
[84:04.02]Oh, shit.
[84:06.06]He's blocking the bullets with his hand.
[84:14.72]Come on.
[84:17.57]Okay, fight!
[84:28.98]I got you.
[84:29.40]Westworld City Hall.
[84:30.50]Crime in progress.
[84:53.61]Why would you shoot a flamethrower out your window down?
[84:57.84]You know the flames would come back up and hit you right in the fucking face.
[85:02.08]Aiming a flamethrower down, wouldn't the flames just come back up and hit you?
[85:15.51]Wouldn't the heat come back when the flames kick back up backwards and hit you in the face?
[85:29.94]Some of those flames would come back and hit you in the face.
[85:37.97]Can I go in?
[85:42.01]Oh, alright.
[85:42.53]I got to put the gun away.
[85:44.17]Now it's just fighting.
[85:47.51]There's liquid in there.
[85:51.33]It's simply hot.
[85:53.03]And plus, wouldn't you burn the building down too?
[85:55.57]If you got like...
[86:00.05]I'm just going, this is not somebody's room, right?
[86:02.59]Why is there a gun on the ground?
[86:05.59]Hot equals up.
[86:06.41]Yeah, heat rises!
[86:07.83]Have you guys ever heard that famous fucking quote by that famous actor in that famous role in that famous movie with that famous comic book character and that famous director?
[86:18.19]Oh no, prepare.
[86:21.60]Everyone's, oh no, no, no, oh no, oh no, no, no.
[86:25.82]The fire rises!
[86:27.80]I had to open up my iced coffee to do that and I got it all over my face.
[86:31.70]It's like a cover.
[86:32.38]It's all over my mouth and my chin and my nose and stuff.
[86:38.28]Hold on.
[86:40.66]Remember, you're so stupid.
[86:41.52]Ban that guy for life.
[86:42.33]Ban that guy for life.
[86:43.03]Don't ever want to see that guy's name again.
[86:44.45]I'm just kidding.
[86:46.37]VIP them for 10 minutes.
[86:47.19]I'm just kidding.
[86:49.37]Don't do that either.
[86:56.59]Who?
[86:57.11]I don't know.
[86:58.87]They're gone already.
[87:03.37]I feel like I see your chat license plates.
[87:10.10]You guys will just drive by and scream, like, you're a fucking loser!
[87:13.58]Like, what's that guy's name?
[87:14.36]Ah, he's gone.
[87:15.08]He's gone.
[87:15.42]He's already gone.
[87:16.00]Fuck.
[87:23.46]I'm going up, I think.
[87:32.34]And some of you guys have a lot of numbers after your names, too.
[87:35.72]So I can get, you know, it's like, well, okay, I see.
[87:37.58]Let's play, let's play, let's play.
[87:39.18]One, a G. Oh, no.
[87:41.99]There's a bunch of numbers after.
[87:43.01]Like, if your name is, like, Greg Six.
[87:47.51]But there's, like, a seven, a two, a nine, and a one after that, too.
[87:49.97]I can't.
[87:51.87]I'm not going to be able to know who the fuck you are.
[87:53.19]I'll get the Greg part.
[88:00.83]I can't do anything in here.
[88:08.13]Oh shit, wait, this is like the boss.
[88:22.80]I love when people at, okay.
[88:28.62]Robocop is never discouraged.
[88:29.78]Let's challenge again.
[88:30.56]No, let's see what the next one is.
[88:32.24]Every time I say a fake person's name, you guys at the fake person.
[88:36.95]Until somebody makes the fake person's name.
[88:43.39]Remember, you made my little sister cry when you made the pig noise that time.
[88:46.61]What do you mean?
[88:53.97]Why is your little sister watching me?
[88:57.87]That's not a good idea.
[88:58.97]Alright, that was Robocop 1.
[89:00.83]Let's see Robocop 2.
[89:03.97]1981.
[89:04.01]Is that 1881?
[89:05.83]That's 1881.
[89:08.21]Got quite a few bullets in that handgun Robocop.
[89:20.21]Only supposed to be, I believe, 12 rounds in there.
[89:24.93]It's like a Gatling gun.
[89:29.20]Alright, let's go.
[89:30.78]Start.
[89:33.66]What?
[89:34.06]Why is he Wolverine?
[89:35.96]A nuke laboratory has been located.
[89:37.66]Destroy all nukes on the premises.
[89:39.71]What?
[89:40.47]Target villains to be arrested are indicated by a flashing icon.
[89:43.89]A select nuke store is reported in this area.
[89:46.33]Why would I blow up the nukes in the nuke lab?
[89:48.21]I don't know who that was, but they've walked out here and I just shot them.
[89:55.70]I don't know who that was.
[89:56.40]I have no idea who you were.
[90:00.35]This moment, I'm on ice.
[90:02.95]Why is there ice momentum in this?
[90:06.83]This is fucking horrible.
[90:12.09]Why is it like... It's just skiing around.
[90:19.10]This is a huge dog fire hydrant too.
[90:28.96]how do I arrest people wait shouldn't I be arresting these people instead there's an arrest icon over there with a flashing indicator so how do I arrest them do I have an arrest button or something to select arrest
[90:58.24]So I have to destroy the nukes here.
[91:01.27]If you don't get enough momentum, by the way, you're not going to make these jumps.
[91:03.73]So I need to... Am I knocking on the door now?
[91:23.48]I'm deciding to knock on this door.
[91:26.12]You have 22% of the nuke.
[91:27.77]You've destroyed 22%.
[91:28.43]You have arrested 40% of the target villains.
[91:31.09]What?
[91:34.45]Report.
[91:35.71]You have not destroyed enough nuke in your last mission.
[91:38.87]Proceed to the firing range for testing and calibration.
[91:42.67]There weren't any nukes.
[91:45.40]And what do you mean arrested?
[91:46.94]I killed everyone.
[91:48.02]Uh...
[91:53.11]This is just another game for the Nintendo.
[91:57.92]By the way, what are you doing up there?
[92:02.38]What's this game called?
[92:08.56]Extra time.
[92:11.68]How many people do I have to kill?
[92:21.14]This is actually in the RoboCop game?
[92:29.25]Oops.
[92:31.31]Oops.
[92:33.79]Alright, this is hard to do.
[92:36.41]38?
[92:37.18]How many people do I have to kill?
[92:41.50]37.
[92:41.66]I have to kill... Oh my god, I have to kill so many more people.
[92:44.76]Alright, does it matter if I miss and hit somebody?
[92:48.10]Okay.
[92:54.77]How much more time do I have?
[92:55.77]Not very much.
[92:56.25]There's so many just random civilians here.
[93:05.48]There's more civilians than the bad guys.
[93:10.12]Come on, come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[93:14.86]I need time.
[93:15.23]Good.
[93:21.07]Ten more people.
[93:21.81]Eleven more people.
[93:23.43]Ten.
[93:23.59]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[93:27.79]Come on!
[93:29.35]Come on!
[93:31.25]Five.
[93:32.85]What?
[93:33.37]Hey!
[93:34.41]What's going on?
[93:36.31]Hello?
[93:36.65]Incoming message.
[93:41.51]Report.
[93:42.86]You have failed to attain enough points in the firing range.
[93:45.46]You must return to your previous assignment.
[94:01.43]No.
[94:02.41]I don't think so.
[94:02.91]Alright, we saw Robocop 4, right?
[94:06.77]So we need to see Robocop 3.
[94:10.17]Super Rescue.
[94:10.97]This is in a different language.
[94:26.27]Robocop?
[94:30.85]That's not Robocop.
[94:37.16]Oh dear.
[94:39.24]Okay.
[94:42.78]Stamina?
[94:46.74]It's a three, like a four hit combo.
[94:49.12]Okay.
[94:58.19]This is kind of fun, but not really at all.
[95:01.09]I'm gonna give it two minutes.
[95:03.49]I'll give this the one minute it deserves, you know what I mean?
[95:08.81]Is this a peace station?
[95:11.87]It is, right?
[95:12.63]What happens if I spell the word?
[95:25.07]Robocop 3.
[95:29.03]Too many Robocops.
[95:30.25]Uh, let go.
[95:33.37]Let go of the grape.
[95:34.39]Play Flappy Bird.
[95:44.68]P. Get it!
[95:48.54]Robocop 4 is 3.
[95:49.68]This is Shatterhand.
[95:53.52]Wait, this is a different... This is a different... This is a game?
[96:01.63]What the fuck is that?
[96:02.63]Alright, this is awesome.
[96:09.02]Yeah, this is a game.
[96:10.06]Oh, it just ripped off.
[96:11.50]Okay.
[96:14.20]They must have just seen the cyborg and just said, you know what?
[96:17.45]I don't know.
[96:17.87]Just put it as Robocop 3.
[96:26.95]This is good.
[96:29.69]It actually is pretty fun.
[96:36.21]Shatterhand is an actually good game.
[96:40.95]It kind of feels that way.
[96:42.05]Alright.
[96:46.79]Play Ace Combat.
[96:49.12]Will you stop with the Ace Combat?
[96:50.78]I'm not going to play Ace Combat.
[96:54.44]Lost time.
[96:54.90]Alright, let's go.
[97:03.24]Shit, okay.
[97:04.44]He swings the gun at you when you get close.
[97:06.12]You can't shoot him with anything?
[97:15.51]That hurt.
[97:19.07]What?
[97:20.65]What was that hitbox?
[97:21.74]Are you serious?
[97:41.32]Actually good game.
[97:42.22]Yeah, dude.
[97:42.64]I'm dead.
[97:43.69]That was fun.
[97:44.75]Alright, we did the whole first page.
[97:53.77]So anything 1 through 10 is done.
[97:57.58]Let's get a random one.
[97:58.30]Why not?
[97:58.62]Let's go random again.
[98:01.70]And... 482.
[98:01.98]Shockwave.
[98:14.65]Shockwave by American Game Cartridges.
[98:19.03]I would probably put at least $100 on the fact that this was not made by an American Game Cartridge company.
[98:28.50]That would be a safe bet.
[98:31.70]But, you know.
[98:32.64]Enter your name.
[98:36.14]X. Who cares?
[98:42.07]Doesn't matter.
[98:44.06]Shockwave.
[98:44.80]Man left.
[98:45.50]Men left 5.
[98:46.44]Code HTI.
[98:47.58]Level 1.
[98:48.24]Minor work.
[98:50.70]What?
[98:54.93]I don't... Oh, cool!
[98:59.99]That's cool.
[99:05.20]Can I dig through these?
[99:09.88]Nice!
[99:10.24]This is awesome!
[99:11.08]Alright, I like this one.
[99:14.69]Do I have a certain amount of ammo?
[99:19.79]Oh, this reminds me of Shub-a-Rob.
[99:30.96]Yeah, the music is absolute dog shit, you're right.
[99:35.60]This one's not bad, though.
[99:37.70]Oh, wait a minute.
[99:38.56]This just got weird.
[99:41.98]Um...
[99:44.01]Oh, no, I don't... This is kind of complicated.
[99:46.91]I don't... Does it... Does it... Does it move it up or down, or... 405.
[100:17.05]405 is... Seaport Gwarrel.
[100:22.26]Seaport Gwarrel.
[100:26.38]Seaport Gwarrel.
[100:30.08]What is Gwarrel?
[100:32.00]Gwarrel?
[100:34.07]That's not supposed to be war, right?
[100:35.95]Seaport War.
[100:37.39]Seaport Gwarrel.
[100:39.25]Gwarrel?
[100:42.47]This one looks like it could be kind of fun.
[100:45.89]Support guard?
[100:46.73]That makes sense.
[100:52.33]Oh, this sucks.
[100:55.71]This is awful.
[100:56.53]It's Space Invaders, but way slower, way more clunky, and not fun at all.
[101:08.21]Turn it off.
[101:19.64]It's so bad.
[101:21.24]I can't even tolerate that for more than one second 526 I Can't even tolerate it load runner.
[101:29.48]Alright, this will be interesting load runner Oh Runner let's go stage one It's bomber man Wait what?
[102:01.26]It's burger time?
[102:03.26]It's burger time and Mario?

[102:39.28]What?
[102:39.66]I'm looking the other way.

[102:42.10]I was looking to the right and I moved my cursor... What was that?
[102:50.31]He dug to the left when I was facing to the right.
[102:53.90]I'm going this way.
[102:54.60]Fuck it.

[103:18.25]That makes some sense.
[103:20.19]Got the gold.
[103:26.12]Didn't Spelunky based on this?
[103:27.26]I need to pick up a bunch of gold bars and then leave.

[103:52.67]Hold on.
[103:54.51]I have to fill it in?
[103:55.63]Didn't I do that?
[104:00.48]You can walk on their heads.
[104:04.90]I need to see what the fuck is going on here.
[104:06.40]Hold on.
[104:08.24]Come here.
[104:10.72]Fill it in and kill them.

[104:38.23]Baron.
[104:40.05]Sky Kid.
[104:41.31]Baron or Baron and Max.
[104:43.89]Let's do Baron first.
[104:47.08]Mission 1.
[104:47.94]Bomb the target.
[104:48.92]This is very bright.
[104:55.84]This is like... This is very... childlike.
[105:01.94]For me, like, shooting at a bunch of, like, people.
[105:06.20]Am I, like, a little kid?
[105:07.88]There's a dodge.
[105:09.98]Oh my...
[105:25.28]No, wrong button.
[105:27.22]There's the dodge.
[105:27.82]I think there's iframes on that.
[105:29.30]I could be wrong, but I think there is.
[105:32.32]I have to bomb the target and hopefully I get there good at a fast enough time.
[105:36.29]Is it a bomb?
[105:38.09]Oh, I do.
[105:38.69]I have the bomb.
[105:40.51]Oops.
[105:40.95]What the fuck?
[105:49.44]Why are there like ladies dancing?
[105:58.87]Was that the target?
[105:59.87]Was that the mansion with the mounted guns on it?
[106:03.87]Okay, give me the bomb.
[106:26.15]Oh my god, dude.
[106:30.77]I need a sip of coffee.
[106:33.61]Oh no, it hurts my eyes too, I promise.
[106:44.57]God damn it, they're gonna come back now.
[106:53.78]Come on, family computer system.
[106:55.40]Alright, don't.
[106:57.36]I got it.
[106:57.64]Okay.
[106:57.78]I'm going to drop the bomb on it.
[106:59.08]I'm ready.
[107:00.77]Target ready.
[107:01.41]Target acquired.
[107:02.05]Here it comes.
[107:03.95]What is this?
[107:04.35]Okay, here we go.
[107:04.89]Drop the bomb.
[107:05.23]Drop, drop.
[107:07.07]It's not it.
[107:12.63]It's not it.
[107:23.23]I like this one, actually.
[107:24.38]If it wasn't so bright and horrible in the eyes, I would actually like this.
[107:32.28]Oh, fuck.
[107:32.80]I missed the bomb.
[107:33.44]Whatever.
[107:34.70]Okay, just dodge.
[107:35.32]What the fuck?
[107:44.03]Oh my god, you can't.
[107:45.09]It's impossible.
[107:48.81]It's impossible.
[107:55.49]Aaron and Max.
[107:57.71]Let's go.
[107:58.57]It's two people?
[108:03.73]He didn't even make it off the runway.
[108:08.41]Didn't even make it off the runway, Max.
[108:12.13]Well, I still got to do the mission, man.
[108:15.53]I still, we have a contract here.
[108:23.69]Oh my fucking god.
[108:24.71]What just happened?
[108:25.33]What?
[108:25.87]I'm still alive.
[108:27.71]What happened?
[108:30.83]Land here.
[108:31.43]I did it.
[108:35.10]Let's go.
[108:46.18]Oh, good start, Max.
[108:48.07]I'm really glad that I...
[108:52.78]I'm really glad you came along.
[109:03.85]The absolute just double cross.
[109:09.42]I want to play this another one.
[109:11.14]One more time.
[109:15.98]I don't get Max anymore.
[109:17.16]He's gone.
[109:22.77]Jesus Christ, that's impossible.
[109:24.35]It's too hard.
[109:25.47]It's a fun one, but you move so slow.
[109:28.59]Alright, what's next?
[109:33.43]415.
[109:36.63]Go backwards, it'll be faster.
[109:41.84]415 is... Holy shit, dude.
[109:44.00]This one is not just warfare.
[109:46.24]Not just a great war.
[109:47.54]Not just constant war.
[109:49.12]The utmost warfare.
[109:53.37]There's no other warfare that will be more, uh, that'll be higher than this.
[109:56.83]That'll be more dangerous.
[109:58.20]And this is as high as, this is the top.
[109:59.92]This is as high as you can go in war.
[110:03.64]And they've already got planets and shit, so we're talking planetary level of destruction.
[110:08.04]I don't know what I'm hitting.
[110:22.22]There's so many particles on the screen.
[110:23.90]I don't know which one is an enemy, which is part of the background.
[110:32.52]Okay, I think I understand.
[110:35.48]Remember the asteroid.
[110:41.93]Oh, double, triple spreader.
[110:43.99]Oh.
[110:55.81]And you have so much screen real estate that you're only gonna use the middle part of the screen and down You really had to have that big planet the big marble in the background had to take up the entire third of the screen They weren't spawning from the middle.
[111:08.22]This would be a lot easier and way more fun.
[111:09.96]I don't know what's coming at us Something is coming towards us
[111:22.01]I feel like I'm watching when somebody uploads an entire television show to YouTube and they put it in a square in the middle of the screen and they surround it with a bunch of other bullshit.
[111:34.84]It's like, dude, you think that's gonna help?
[111:51.60]Oh, there'll never be a war that will be more than this.
[111:56.42]Okay.
[112:04.33]I've had enough.
[112:06.71]What's next?
[112:07.09]357.
[112:14.88]Boot cat.
[112:15.68]I got a good feeling about boot cat.
[112:18.16]Boot cat.
[112:20.97]It's just that's a cat inside of a boot this couldn't get any more fun Scene one England That's not where England is That was uh that was California Is it cat boy?
[112:47.13]Boot cat
[112:55.56]What's going on with these other cats?
[112:58.38]Oh boy.
[113:00.46]Uh... You have to sta- It just stands still to shoot.
[113:11.89]Uh... There's only four seconds left?
[113:14.89]What?
[113:17.03]Why is the timer counting up instead of down?
[113:19.05]That's kind of weird, right?
[113:21.09]Why is it at 14 seconds?
[113:31.16]Is this a real game or did they make this up?
[113:37.48]Is that the time of day?
[113:39.34]Is that going to reset it to zero?
[113:40.88]Yeah, that's the time of day.
[113:42.56]That's what time it is right now.
[113:43.72]They decided to add a full cycling clock?
[113:49.64]I don't know.
[113:54.76]Why? 23?
[114:02.93]I can't shoot.
[114:03.95]There's a giant shark under there, and I'm barely concerned.
[114:07.05]Oh, my eyes!
[114:10.62]Why?
[114:12.18]Why would you put this in the game?
[114:14.54]What are you doing?
[114:15.72]Why would you do this?
[114:16.76]Oh, my God.
[114:20.67]The sun just exploded.
[114:21.99]This is a long level one, by the way.
[114:28.95]It just doesn't stop.
[114:35.87]We could have done Mario 1-1 10 times by now.
[114:42.33]It never ends.
[114:43.68]Dragon.
[114:53.47]Okay, let's go to the Atlantic Ocean.
[114:55.37]Ooh, cool.
[114:56.23]Alright, I'm beating this whole game.
[114:59.13]Let's go.
[115:02.90]It's even doing the Mario song.
[115:05.71]You're in the water level.
[115:07.15]Oh, I love it.
[115:07.89]Bootcat is perfect.
[115:15.34]Wait, that's supposed to be water.
[115:19.13]What?
[115:20.68]Why is the water go into like a mountain?
[115:23.74]Get out of here.
[115:32.54]What is this?
[115:33.52]Can I go in this?
[115:38.54]How many different paint tools are you gonna use?
[115:40.58]You can't just change the thickness of the pen halfway through your MS Paint drawing.
[115:46.02]You can't do that.
[115:46.68]But what happened to the consistency?
[115:57.28]I can't wait to see.
[115:57.78]Here's another water mountain.
[116:07.72]Is this lightning now coming down from the sky?
[116:09.64]I think these are supposed to be waves.
[116:15.15]Oh, really?
[116:18.77]What the fuck is that thing?
[116:21.51]What just stole me?
[116:22.73]Something just came and took me.
[116:28.53]It was a rat or a mouse or something, yeah.
[116:42.65]This is the best one so far.
[116:43.99]Bootcat's the best.
[116:47.97]It's just... It's... I love it.
[116:50.71]It's so good.
[116:51.41]Almost got hit by that shit.
[116:58.06]I have to do well enough to beat this level, because I need to see what's next.
[117:08.12]Alright, watch out, here comes the lightning.
[117:19.42]What the fuck was that?
[117:20.60]Alright, easy, easy, easy.
[117:21.48]Don't get struck, don't get struck, don't get struck.
[117:23.70]Go, go, go, go, go!
[117:26.34]We're in the same exact spot, too.
[117:28.30]Come on.
[117:28.86]Alright, last try, last try, last try, last try.
[117:32.80]We have to go up the water mountain and the lightning is right above you.
[117:49.65]No, but I have to jump.
[117:50.73]I can't just...
[118:02.96]Alright, don't blow it.
[118:06.66]Have we figured out what the timer is actually for?
[118:08.93]Or is it just there for some reason?
[118:12.97]What's the 73 in the top?
[118:15.41]Wait.
[118:17.11]It's not 73 lives, is it?
[118:19.15]What's the P?
[118:21.53]Alright, don't go fast because you have the ability to.
[118:26.08]Here comes a lightning.
[118:28.10]Slow down.
[118:31.41]Look at that movement pattern.
[118:33.45]They move with the screen faster when you hit right.
[118:42.62]Oh my god.
[118:50.92]Stop doing that.
[118:51.94]Stop doing that.
[118:52.76]Stop doing that.
[118:53.50]Stop doing that.
[118:54.34]Stop doing that.
[118:54.90]I can't show that.
[118:56.24]I can't fucking show that.
[118:58.88]I can't do that.
[119:03.06]No, I ain't gonna show this.
[119:04.00]I can't even look at the screen.
[119:04.76]I'm trying as hard as I can to get to the end.
[119:10.42]Oh my god, this is impossible.
[119:12.84]You have no idea how hard this is.
[119:15.46]These things just started spawning from the right side of the screen and they're hitting me over and over again and I'm gonna die.
[119:20.67]I can't look at the screen.
[119:21.33]I'm doing this with my eyes closed, kind of.
[119:22.59]I'm opening them every five- Okay, we're good.
[119:24.67]We're back.
[119:26.59]Here, we're good.
[119:34.77]So many things were attacking me at the same time.
[119:36.17]I can't believe you couldn't see that.
[119:39.97]My head hurts now.
[119:51.07]Oh my god.
[119:52.95]No, he just comes out of nowhere.
[119:55.17]He just comes out of nowhere.
[119:57.17]He just appears on the side of the screen and starts shooting fire.
[120:00.63]What the fuck?
[120:06.74]No, I wanted to do, I want to see them.
[120:11.55]I ain't doing that flash the screen thing again.
[120:13.51]No way.
[120:15.11]Sorry.
[120:16.07]That was Bootcat.
[120:18.11]And after Bootcat, we're going to go here.
[120:19.35]375 is Pon Pon Volley.
[120:29.45]Pond Pond Volley.
[120:30.77]You got a link for me.
[120:31.51]I guess I'll give it a look and see what it is.
[120:33.91]Important as a dead update.
[120:35.08]Okay.
[120:35.38]Well, I'll give it a look.
[120:36.28]See, it's getting spammed.
[120:39.82]It's just cat boy Jerma.
[120:41.36]This will be on the select screen.
[120:42.56]Alright.
[120:42.86]Well, alright.
[120:43.56]No more links.
[120:44.34]No more links.

[120:50.01]Oh, boy.
[120:54.13]I like the background animals.
[121:03.60]Pretty cute.
[121:07.30]Ah, that's Hello Kitty.
[121:09.26]That's, uh... Carrow the flog.
[121:13.42]Frog.
[121:14.58]That's Snoopy the dog, and then that's Little Boy.
[121:21.43]Oh, it's a different language.
[121:22.97]We're gonna have to do the first option.
[121:26.75]I want to be, uh... Carrow.
[121:30.23]Yes.
[121:31.05]The computer's gonna be Snoopy.

[121:45.66]Uh, alright.
[121:46.32]It's my turn.
[121:50.88]I just got killed.
[121:52.12]It just hurt me.
[121:56.64]Is that, uh, for the first time I thought that was spelling I-C-U-P at the bottom.
[121:59.78]I thought it was like, oh, spell I-C-U-P.
[122:02.42]I-C-U-P.
[122:04.26]That's what I thought that was.
[122:05.58]Good.
[122:14.65]Where's the net?
[122:16.61]Isn't there usually a net?
[122:20.16]This is...
[122:27.05]It's actually really not that bad.
[122:28.79]It's, like, cute, but functionality-wise, it's kind of at a zero.
[122:32.97]Nice jumping hit, okay.
[122:35.07]Alright, that's a good volley.
[122:38.97]Oh.
[122:42.85]It's a baby game.
[122:43.53]There are no nets. ...
[123:00.37]This is actually a Hello Kitty game?
[123:01.99]I'm sure it is.
[123:02.55]I need one- come on.
[123:16.64]Nope.

[128:03.94]There's no in between.
[128:04.64]It's not like I kind of like pool.
[128:13.21]No, no, no.
[128:13.55]You either love this and do this a lot or you hate doing this.
[128:20.35]And the idea of somebody saying, hey, do you want to go play pool?
[128:22.79]Is like, God, please don't fucking ever ask me.
[128:25.54]Please, I hope no one ever asks me so I don't have to say yes.
[128:27.84]This game, I'm done.
[128:42.81]I just wanted to hang out, Jesus.
[128:44.35]466, what do we got?
[128:51.24]Karaki.
[128:54.49]The... The Karate Kid.
[129:00.73]Licensed by Nintendo of America.
[129:05.76]Karate tournament first round.
[129:07.04]Chances remaining three.
[129:11.78]Oh, my God.
[129:12.18]I fucking annihilated this guy.
[129:15.74]How old were they?
[129:16.92]What's the... Who am I?
[129:18.47]What?
[129:19.96]Holy shit, this is unfair.
[129:22.63]This is like a 30-year-old in like the 12-year-old competition.
[129:25.25]You gotta get this guy out of here.
[129:26.81]Semi-final round.
[129:35.01]Final round of the tournament.
[129:39.70]This person's in a suit.
[129:44.26]Holy shit, they're strong.
[129:45.16]Fuck, I lost.
[129:55.74]Oh yeah, hey, you wanna get fuckin' original Mortal Kombat strategy to make your friends fuckin' scream in your face and leave the house?
[130:07.53]I'm fuckin' leavin', Mike.
[130:09.68]I'm not comin' back.
[130:10.42]Wait, side-scroller?
[130:11.14]I thought it was just a tournament.
[130:24.79]How many of you guys had the... Alright, there's a few, you know, ground rules that are played.
[130:30.59]That are put in place when you play video games with your friends, right?
[130:33.49]Anybody ever played a sports game, like a baseball, with their friends?
[130:37.29]One-on-one?
[130:38.77]And you have to make the rule.
[130:40.60]You are only allowed to throw strikes.
[130:42.80]Because throwing balls was impossible to read and you would miss every time if they threw it way far away.
[130:51.24]No leg sweeps in Mortal Kombat or you automatically lose.
[130:59.28]Like, if you do a leg sweep in Mortal Kombat, I win the match.
[131:03.16]If you throw a ball in, like, some of those old Super Nintendo games that were baseball, you automatically lose.
[131:08.99]Like, because they're unhittable and you can't even tell that they're coming in as a ball.
[131:16.53]GoldenEye?
[131:17.57]Nobody is allowed to play Oddjob.
[131:21.48]You gotta put down the video game ground rules.
[131:30.27]All of a sudden, I'm going to get trued on that one.
[131:32.10]Why is that lady up in a tree?
[131:34.36]I'm going to get trued on that one?
[131:35.68]You're going to true that one?
[131:37.60]Not the other one?
[131:38.14]I'm dead.
[131:49.51]Daniel-san in Okinawa.
[131:51.29]Oh, okay.
[131:52.11]I got one more life.
[131:54.85]This one's actually pretty fun.
[131:57.09]This is probably just the actual game.
[132:00.47]But... Did they do the movie backwards?
[132:06.08]Doesn't the tournament happen in the end of the movie?
[132:18.71]Put the popular one to not seem like a Mortal Kombat scrub.
[132:26.44]I'm sorry, but the legs sweeping Mortal Kombat like one two and three swing the hammer Alright if anybody trains like that That's what would happen.
[132:44.74]I Know you like to watch that in movies and TV shows all the extreme training regimen Well, you feel like dodge like all these things look at all the knife.
[132:50.43]It's gonna kill you You're dead you're gonna die Dodge the pendulum
[132:56.14]I'm gonna, like, you're gonna go through, like, the fucking football training thing and smash into stuff.
[133:00.24]No.
[133:00.54]Just fucking do push-ups and, like, kick into the mirror.
[133:03.63]Please, relax.
[133:16.85]Kick.
[133:17.27]No, kick into the mirror, not kick the mirror.
[133:19.27]Like, watch yourself kicking to see how good the form is.
[133:24.21]I need to be level one, at least.
[133:25.60]Come on.
[133:33.70]You broke the mirror.
[133:34.38]I didn't say to kick the mirror.
[133:35.68]Ice block break.
[133:42.79]Ow!
[133:44.13]Oh, I gotta go to the hospital.
[133:45.27]I gotta go to the hospital.
[133:46.19]Oh, why did I do that?
[133:47.03]Why did we do this shit?
[133:48.01]I could have just fucking done push-ups and kicked into the mirror.
[134:00.02]Gonna take like six to eight weeks for this to heal.
[134:03.51]Maybe longer.
[134:06.50]What's this person throwing?

[142:25.01]Come over here.
[142:29.27]Go in.
[142:29.67]Go in.
[142:30.35]Go in.
[142:31.17]Go in.
[142:31.93]Go in.
[142:35.53]He's a wrench in the background.
[142:38.09]You see that?
[142:42.98]Wait, there was... What's going on?
[142:54.60]What am I missing?
[142:55.62]Do I have to destroy the top left ones?
[142:57.58]I blew up the pillar.
[142:58.50]It's just wrecking crew.
[143:01.03]Who cares?
[143:01.33]256.
[143:01.35]I think we already did this one.
[143:13.55]We did 250.
[143:15.21]No, we did not.
[143:15.95]We did not do animal contest.
[143:21.38]I'm looking forward to it.
[143:24.63]ANIMAL CONTEST!
[143:28.94]Stage 1.
[143:29.74]Oh, cool, alright, there's a big animal talent show.
[143:38.98]Dog!
[143:40.70]Cool, dog and cat.
[143:43.70]And now this one's dog and squirrel.
[143:49.12]Okay, next up is dog and lion.
[143:52.58]Lion beats dog.
[143:53.70]Okay, I get it.
[143:57.90]Cat versus rhinoceros.
[143:59.50]Rhinoceros beats cat.
[144:01.48]How do I choose what animals I have, though?
[144:05.34]Lion versus cat.
[144:07.03]Lion beats cat.
[144:10.29]Lion versus lion.
[144:11.33]Okay, we gotta go again.
[144:12.99]Pig versus... That's a tie.
[144:15.39]Warthog versus lion.
[144:16.19]No, it's not.
[144:16.93]I win them all.
[144:19.61]I can't select my animals, though.
[144:23.60]Elephant versus tiger.
[144:24.92]Yeah.
[144:27.86]Lion versus rhinoceros.
[144:30.62]Warthog versus cat.
[144:34.21]Lion versus tiger.
[144:36.47]Really?
[144:36.81]I don't know about that one.
[144:41.13]Mouse versus warthog.
[144:42.79]Yeah.
[144:44.75]Elephant versus rhinoceros.
[144:46.83]Really?
[144:48.51]Elephant versus rhinoceros.
[144:49.73]Again.
[144:52.61]Mouse versus lion.
[144:54.91]Now that wouldn't happen.
[144:55.65]I would pull a splinter out of his foot and we'd become best friends and I would win.
[145:00.13]Mouse versus dog.
[145:01.83]Mouse is the worst.
[145:02.33]Why do I have so many mice?
[145:04.39]Lion versus... Uh-oh, here we go.
[145:05.51]This is going to be big.
[145:06.63]Warthog versus elephant.
[145:08.43]Elephant fucking wins.
[145:13.81]Dog versus lion.
[145:15.13]This game is stupid.
[145:18.63]Do you just have to just hit A until...
[145:23.37]But how is somebody gonna win if we can't decide what our deck is?
[145:27.89]Yes, I just said deck, but how else would you like me to describe this?
[145:37.54]It's just RNG.
[145:41.88]He's won so many hands in a row.
[145:46.80]Everyone's never played war?
[145:50.82]Yeah.
[145:51.36]Uh-oh.
[145:52.76]This is big.
[145:54.74]Elephant versus Warthog.
[145:55.98]I'll take them all.
[146:05.09]The mouse doesn't win.
[146:06.33]Okay, so the mouse is like a two.
[146:11.05]This is going to come back this way now.
[146:12.51]It's never going to end.
[146:15.82]I'm invested now.
[146:18.18]I was invested until we saw all the different animals.
[146:21.58]And now it's just unwinnable war.
[146:26.16]Because it's just going to go back and forth forever.
[146:34.83]Somebody said, what a truly terrible game.
[146:41.21]No, you know what I feel bad for?
[146:42.41]All the people in the audience.
[146:45.53]Especially the people in the front row.
[146:47.45]Because those tickets were $1,000.
[146:48.59]You guys.
[146:53.64]Us.
[146:54.32]No, I mean in the game.
[147:00.48]Yeah, there's no winner.
[147:01.40]It's not going to happen.
[147:02.14]It's just flipping a coin over and over again until you win the 20 times in a row.
[147:05.71]We'll see you in the next one, please.
[147:08.17]That was Animal War.
[147:09.13]$3.31.
[147:10.77]Alright, after this one we're going to pick some.
[147:16.49]We'll find one that looks good.
[147:17.61]331.
[147:17.63]I want to play I Can Remember.
[147:24.68]Okay, let's do this one first.
[147:26.00]Alpha Mission.
[147:31.64]Octo, Shield, Cannon, Homing, Paralyzer, Nuclear, Fire, Thunder.
[147:40.05]I'm not playing the game.
[147:43.95]Oh.
[147:45.73]SID 3.
[147:51.43]So far so good.
[147:51.91]This is actually seems pretty elaborate.
[147:55.50]This doesn't seem bad.
[147:58.98]L E I got E. I'm gonna play I can remember.
[148:10.48]I don't care.
[148:17.64]I can remember.
[148:20.86]That's a lot of Fisher-Price trademarks for a fake video game.
[148:22.24]No, it's just memory.
[148:22.68]I can remember!
[148:45.88]Instructions.
[148:46.56]Make your selection.
[148:47.24]Let's see.
[148:48.42]The object is to uncover and match the hidden Fisher Price toys.
[148:52.04]The player with the highest score after three rounds wins.
[148:56.44]Okay.
[148:57.20]I know how to do that.
[148:57.80]I get it.
[149:00.50]Okay.
[149:01.92]Oh my god.
[149:03.66]Holy shit.
[149:04.62]The amount of instructions.
[149:05.56]One player.
[149:08.62]Play alone.
[149:12.39]Everyone use the controller to spell your name.
[149:15.51]That just shocked me.
[149:16.19]I just got electrocuted.
[149:19.62]Level one.
[149:20.04]Alright, match the Fisher-Price toys.
[149:24.80]We have Legos.
[149:27.92]And a Furby.
[149:29.86]That's not correct.
[149:32.51]Furby around back then?
[149:35.37]Cool sunglasses and a camera.
[149:44.71]Toilet paper.
[149:46.99]And Furby.
[149:47.59]Wait, where's the other Furby?
[149:54.83]Is that a... What is that?
[149:56.33]A bicycle?
[149:56.91]Alright, toilet paper.
[149:58.51]Toilet paper.
[149:58.89]Toilet paper.
[150:00.47]Toilet paper.
[150:01.12]Four and nine.
[150:02.78]Twinkle, twinkle little star.
[150:05.38]Come on down.
[150:06.98]Yeah.
[150:09.72]Got it.
[150:20.11]Beautiful singing.
[150:20.97]Alright, where's, uh, camera?
[150:24.05]Roll three.
[150:25.09]Alright, three and twelve.
[150:30.67]Wait, we're gonna make a, uh, we're making a picture.
[150:32.29]Furby and Furby.
[150:40.99]Yeah, I told you I could sing.
[150:43.49]Yeah, everyone's like, oh my god, this is the first dream I've ever been here.
[150:46.54]He said he could sing, and then he sung that twinkle, twinkle little star, and I fucking had chills throughout my entire body.
[150:57.94]What are we, are we building a cash register?
[151:10.55]What is this?
[151:14.25]I don't know what I'm looking at.
[151:15.17]Is this like a grocery checkout?
[151:17.13]You did very well.
[151:21.67]Round two.
[151:22.05]Alright.
[151:23.83]Standing mixer.
[151:25.75]And cash register.
[151:26.62]Alright.
[151:26.94]Standing mixer is on eight.
[151:29.36]Four.
[151:30.04]Six and eight.
[151:30.84]So what do we got?
[151:31.36]Two.
[151:31.54]Here we go.
[151:33.98]Cash register.
[151:34.58]Cash register.
[151:38.82]A musical note in the background.
[151:39.82]Cool.
[151:41.34]Alright.
[151:42.82]Pretty good.
[151:49.17]Am I making a Ouija board?
[151:50.13]Alright, horsey.
[151:53.79]And... One of those push machines that has the balls in it that pretends to be a lawnmower.
[151:59.34]And it goes... There's a little thing in the middle that pops the balls up.
[152:05.48]I love those.
[152:05.92]It's like my favorite toy.
[152:17.29]Okay, uh, I don't know what that is.
[152:19.13]Bathtub?
[152:20.93]There it is.
[152:25.73]It's so loud.
[152:26.47]No, it's not.
[152:29.25]I don't know.
[152:31.37]What is Mary Had a Little Lamb?
[152:36.00]What are the lyrics?
[152:40.42]It's like three words in the whole song.
[152:45.93]It's Mary had a little lamb, Mary had a little lamb.
[152:48.29]And the sheep's wool was what?
[152:52.55]It's a real lawnmower.
[152:53.51]His fur was soft as snow.
[153:06.42]That's not it.
[153:08.36]Whose fur was soft as snow?
[153:10.46]You got it wrong too.
[153:11.30]That's incorrect.
[153:17.03]Mary had a little lamb, little lamb.
[153:20.61]It's always funny when people sing nursery rhymes like that.
[153:23.99]And look, when you sing Mary had a little lamb or twinkle, twinkle little star, it's just so simple and basic and the syllables and the way that you say it is broken up so deliberately.
[153:33.64]Like Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
[153:40.32]But when you have a singer that gets ahold of those.
[153:43.86]It's no longer simple anymore.
[153:45.30]It's like, Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.
[153:52.10]It's like, you just fucking sing the song normally, for God's sake.
[153:55.66]Mary had a little lamb, whose snow was half as large.
[154:11.53]I'm getting old.
[154:17.10]with this one this one sucks you're gonna read the time I am not high right now okay leave me alone and let me just enjoy fruit pig milk nuts nuts and milk nut what does that say get away from me
[154:46.28]Dead we just both died alright.
[154:48.10]I'm done with milk nuts I'm not playing nuts and milk.
[154:55.51]What's the fruit pig?
[155:02.91]Berry had a little lamb little lamb Holy shit this one looks awesome catch the fruit
[155:19.15]I feel like this is part of the end credits of Sing.
[155:24.92]They would do something like this, right?
[155:25.90]Like the pig dancing with retro graphics and stuff.
[155:28.70]I think that did happen, didn't it?
[155:39.74]What is the song?
[155:40.84]The song at the end of that song.
[155:42.61]It's like... Hold on.
[155:44.97]Try everything.
[155:46.80]Try everything.
[155:48.14]Right?
[155:48.42]How's it go?
[155:48.88]How's it go?
[155:58.70]Try everything!
[155:59.70]That's the wrong movie about animals.
[156:01.36]Whatever.
[156:01.88]It's this... Sorry, two animal movies came out that were 3D.
[156:04.96]That had animals in three dimensions.
[156:07.10]And they had, like, fun.
[156:08.14]And they, like, was the lessons that they learned.
[156:09.65]Okay, sorry.
[156:10.51]I got it wrong.
[156:18.59]How did I lose?
[156:19.21]I got, like... What a harvest that was.
[156:24.59]You're one of the only... You're one of seven people that actually watched Sing.
[156:30.67]Um... That movie's insanely popular.
[156:33.39]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[156:36.62]Oh, I need to... Okay, I need to catch more than 11 of each one.
[156:39.00]Sure, let's go.
[156:39.42]Just gotta stay in the middle.
[156:52.96]Try everything.
[156:54.73]Try everything.
[156:56.19]Don't try everything.
[156:57.27]That song implies to try cigarettes.
[157:00.55]Don't do that.
[157:01.09]I'm gonna lose again.
[157:17.52]Not enough lemons have dropped.
[157:19.48]There's only been like 10 lemons total in the entire playthrough.
[157:29.07]Come on.
[157:29.41]I need lemons.
[157:29.89]Only lemons.
[157:30.45]Lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon.

[157:37.40]I got it.
[157:44.16]I win.
[157:44.60]You're disappointing the banana bros.
[157:48.50]That's not what you guys are called.
[157:49.44]Excuse me.
[157:51.46]Had enough of fruit pig.
[157:59.86]Uh, what do we got?
[158:00.46]Let's do, uh... How about, uh... Let's do... How about Chubby... How about Doughboy?
[158:18.53]A. Uh... Why is Doughboy exp... Okay.

[159:11.00]Left 3.
[159:12.08]I touched a rock and died.
[159:13.20]I'm just going to try to get to the end.
[159:24.95]Views.
[159:25.99]Mines.
[159:27.59]These trees are in the way.
[159:28.53]I can't move.
[159:29.85]Okay.
[159:30.53]Bad enough.
[159:39.12]412.
[159:46.09]Submarine.
[159:48.03]And then I'm going to play Toy Factory after.
[159:53.55]Isn't a submarine under the water?
[159:56.29]Not floating on top of the water?
[159:58.33]That's why it's called submarine.
[160:08.84]I like this one.
[160:11.63]This one's good.
[160:13.19]This one's really good.
[160:14.17]I really like it.
[160:20.57]I won?
[160:24.56]Level two, where the sky is a different color.
[160:37.48]Got that guy.
[160:38.06]That's worth a million points, probably.
[160:47.27]No!
[160:50.49]Sing this for a billion off the debt.
[160:54.03]Just because one person says it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[160:56.07]There needs to be at least a 50 to 60% agreeance with everybody in chat here.
[161:08.17]You gotta get at least 10 people on board.
[161:10.13]And then those 10 people have to get 20 people on board.
[161:13.13]And those 20 people have to get 100 people on board.
[161:14.69]And those 100 people have to get another 500 people on board.
[161:19.28]And that's how you get 10% of people in this chat that liked the Catboy shit to, like, 70%.
[161:26.40]Because now I have to dress up as one.
[161:35.93]I'm gonna beat this game.
[161:41.20]Am I actually going to get to the end?
[161:54.51]This reminds me of the Gamer V Portable.
[162:02.44]I thought it was a question mark.
[162:07.38]Alright, that was fun.
[162:08.56]Let's pick one.
[162:11.14]Try harder.
[162:11.92]I don't really... Do you think I... Flappy.
[162:15.88]Is this Flappy Bird, you think?
[162:16.86]Let's try.
[162:19.11]Flappy!
[162:19.61]Push select button.
[162:23.55]Keyword and music.
[162:25.93]Input keyword.
[162:28.77]What's keyword mean?
[162:29.87]Fun.
[162:38.03]And we'll do music.
[162:40.53]Uh...
[162:47.08]Definitely be.
[162:47.58]I don't care what the other ones are.
[162:53.80]This is the bar song in Undertale.
[163:03.44]Okay, how do you play?
[163:07.85]It's kind of freaking me out to have people just locked up in like a cage up there and make them do this shit.
[163:14.23]Um...
[163:18.63]I don't know how this works.
[163:19.69]I have to get the ball on the... I have to get that.
[163:27.70]Okay, I get it.
[163:28.72]Well, just kill me.
[163:29.38]I didn't get it right.
[163:30.00]Okay, so we have to move this out of the way.
[163:38.84]Can I go over here?
[163:41.94]Um...
[163:46.63]It's one of these dumbass puzzle games. 45.
[164:18.82]Chip and Dale 2.
[164:19.62]Alright.
[164:21.47]I'm going to start picking them.
[164:22.83]Let's do Chip and Dale.
[164:24.35]We'll start with Chip and Dale 2, and then we'll go to Chip and Dale 1, and then 3.
[164:27.71]Let's do it like the Star Wars movies.
[164:31.84]They take Capcom off the top of that, by the way.
[164:34.52]They just deleted it.
[164:35.36]They just put a black over it.
[164:37.88]That says probably Capcom Presents.
[164:39.22]That was a Capcom font.
[164:48.65]Chip and Dale, Rescue Rangers.
[164:53.61]Yeah, now it's legal.
[164:54.71]Yeah, they've removed who made it on the splash screen.
[164:57.65]Therefore, it's now completely legal to just sell it.
[165:03.08]Lots of singing today.
[165:05.40]Alright, I want to be... I think I have more connection with Dale.
[165:08.96]I'll be honest.
[165:30.37]Uh-oh, fat cat has infiltrated the gold facility and took 10 bars of gold.
[165:36.69]Chip and Dale, get on the case.
[165:37.83]He just broke in here and went that way.
[165:42.84]You must get him and get our gold back.
[165:49.28]I'm ready.
[165:50.16]I'll get the gold back.
[165:51.72]Me and Dale will get it.
[165:52.62]I don't know what she says.
[166:00.05]I wish I could read this.
[166:05.23]I thought he was going to jump right on her head.
[166:13.40]Alright, let's go.
[166:14.06]We have to introduce every single character that's in the show.
[166:18.42]Get Jiminy Cricket out of here.
[166:21.14]There he is.
[166:21.82]There's Dale.
[166:23.92]So Dale is, if I remember, I haven't seen the show or seen him talk in probably 10 years or so.
[166:29.61]Dale is like a high-pitched goofy, right?
[166:31.41]It's goofy, but higher pitched.
[166:38.70]Okay, I can read that one.
[166:44.10]Do it.
[166:44.44]It's like, wow, I... Hold on, I'll try to get it.
[166:48.82]I think it's like Goofy.
[166:50.28]It's like Goofy, but it's high-pitched.
[166:52.41]It's like this.
[166:53.43]It's kind of like Goofy, but kind of like this.
[166:55.71]Is it like that?
[166:58.37]Oh, I don't know about this damn chip.
[167:04.53]Let me think.
[167:07.41]But it's like the Alvin and the Chipmunks.
[167:08.80]They pitch it up, right?
[167:09.74]Hold on.
[167:11.36]See if I can get it.
[167:11.84]If I do this...
[167:19.18]Oh, it's me!
[167:20.40]Oh, shit!
[167:20.94]We gotta get down there and save that gold!
[167:23.54]If we don't get it, we're gonna be in bad trouble!
[167:25.35]Is that close?
[167:32.13]Goku?
[167:33.73]No.
[167:35.01]Now let me see what it actually sounds like.
[167:37.15]Uh, Chip and Dale, let me, hold on.
[167:53.00]I'm falling out of my chair.
[167:58.48]Alright.
[167:59.26]Okay, Chippendale.
[168:00.08]There's a gadget scene.
[168:01.26]I just want to hear the voice for a second.
[168:07.50]Can I not hear it?
[168:10.92]Why can I not hear this?
[168:16.06]I should be able to hear this.
[168:16.82]Why can I not hear it?
[168:19.28]Oh, because I plugged in the wrong thing.
[168:20.30]Alright.
[168:21.81]Let's see how close I was.
[168:27.91]Here he comes.
[168:31.42]Come on, Dale.
[168:31.96]Talk.
[168:34.88]Talk, Dale.
[168:36.54]Does Dale not talk?
[168:37.40]Did I get it completely wrong?
[168:38.30]He doesn't talk.
[168:57.88]Dale doesn't talk.
[168:58.70]I fucked the whole thing up.
[169:01.26]Dale doesn't talk.
[169:04.62]This is Chip.
[169:07.64]I told you it was pitched up like crazy.
[169:15.80]Dale doesn't talk at all.
[169:18.69]Chip and Dale, Rescue Rangers.
[169:19.73]Hold on.
[169:20.01]Dale, look.
[169:22.53]There's another one.
[169:28.26]I was close.
[169:37.36]Yeah, it was close.
[169:45.21]It was not high pitched enough.
[169:46.31]Alright, let me get back to play this game.
[169:55.77]Please, I'm still on the chair?
[169:57.37]What?
[169:58.72]I mean, I'm still on the chair a bit.
[169:59.92]What are you talking about?
[170:07.12]Oh, a burger.
[170:20.71]Why these blocks don't exist?
[170:22.23]I tried to jump.
[170:22.95]Game is not even fucking fun.
[170:24.09]Game is fucking stupid.
[170:28.91]I feel like those blocks are not supposed to be like the P question mark.
[170:32.31]Alright, I'm gonna drop this on his head.
[170:37.61]We need a cat puke.
[170:38.71]Alright, first cat puke of the year.
[170:40.11]You got it.
[170:49.15]You want a first?
[170:50.33]I'll give you a first cat puke of the year.
[170:51.93]Come on.
[171:11.12]Did that in Super Mario, uh, old material.
[171:14.22]Alright, um, I can't go down.
[171:15.58]That was Chippendale 2.
[171:21.76]Let's see what Chippendale 1 is.
[171:27.33]You swallowed food the same time that I did.
[171:29.13]That's a little weird, I'll say.
[171:34.45]Alright, Chippendale 1.
[171:36.43]Walt Disney Company, produced by Capcom, forgot to scratch that one out.
[171:49.51]This actually just is the Chippendale game, isn't it?
[171:51.55]Yeah, this is just the game.
[171:55.83]I've played it before.
[171:56.97]Chippendale 3.
[172:18.50]Alright.
[172:20.58]Okay.
[172:22.50]Hip ale three.
[172:26.10]That's definitely, that is definitely not Chippendale.
[172:33.12]Destroy enemy's underground artillery base, Chippendale.
[172:35.88]What are you talking about?
[172:40.42]Are you sure we don't have to go fix grandma's recipe?
[172:44.74]No, Chippendale, you're going to go to a foreign fucking land and you're going to start shooting at stuff.
[172:50.33]What are you talking about?
[172:51.33]I don't have any military training.
[172:54.49]Well, that's too bad, Dale.
[172:55.61]Better start firing.
[172:57.43]Where's the code?
[173:05.65]Where's Sora?
[173:10.55]Why would they do this?
[173:16.50]My speakers?
[173:17.18]What happened?
[173:23.22]How bad does that sound?
[173:24.24]Holy shit, he's a flamethrower!
[173:32.27]It was that bad?
[173:33.45]Was it?
[173:33.77]I just tried to put the pitch up a little.
[173:38.01]Chip and Dale!
[173:41.17]Firing missiles!
[173:44.08]It was extremely bad?
[173:45.26]It was the... What?
[173:48.36]Hold on.
[173:49.38]How's this?
[173:49.79]Is this different?
[173:50.27]Is this better?
[173:50.69]How's this one?
[173:54.03]This is like a... Is this what I was supposed to be, right?
[173:57.75]Yeah, so what happened?
[173:58.75]I think my device like fucked up.
[174:11.84]Chip and Dale go to like war with fucking flamethrowers and machine guns But who what are these like other bears there's like these are bears, okay, I just gotta run off by a tank Oh
[174:43.34]Maybe you did.
[174:43.94]Do you think they just didn't know that like Chip and Dale was like a kid's cartoon?
[174:47.24]Oh yeah.
[174:49.52]Chip and Dale.
[174:50.58]Uh, I guess just, just put that down.
[174:52.68]I mean, people know who that is.
[175:07.94]Got it.
[175:08.37]Got it.
[175:08.85]Got it.
[175:09.37]Nice job, Dale.
[175:13.42]He took out that enemy tank.
[175:22.29]I'm in.
[175:24.29]Out of the front door of the base.
[175:26.60]Dale, relax.
[175:29.80]This is like the big smile on your face.
[175:31.66]This is fucked up.
[175:52.66]Don't waste ammo.
[175:55.12]So what game is this actually that they put Chip and Dale on?
[175:57.45]Of all the things.
[176:05.59]Don't waste bullets.
[176:07.55]I'll be alright.
[176:08.47]I mean, there's so many things on the screen.
[176:12.08]Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers.
[176:14.20]I want to get to the boss.
[176:21.36]This is just Chip and Dale 3, dude.
[176:22.88]What are you talking about?
[176:30.53]Play Ace Combat.
[176:31.67]Get out of here!
[176:32.29]This is a hack of Heavy Barrel?
[176:46.46]It's so funny because they have the other real Chip and Dale games.
[176:49.46]Why even put this one on?
[176:55.01]What's the process to add Chippendale 3 but make it a kill people game?
[176:59.53]Throwing grenades.
[177:07.97]How many keys do I need?
[177:15.84]It's for you to stream.
[177:17.02]I do not think whoever made this console was concerned about me streaming this console.
[177:31.17]were, I think they would be a little more careful of all the copywritten content that is in it.
[177:45.86]I'm enjoying Chippendale 3 though.
[177:47.18]It's actually kind of fun.
[177:51.86]Yeah, I can't look at that floor anymore.
[177:53.00]It hurts so bad.
[178:02.97]I can't open those?
[178:03.69]I don't get killed by my own grenade, right?
[178:06.33]Alright, come on, let's get a boss.
[178:08.93]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's that guy with the mustache.
[178:13.73]Come on, other Chip and Dale characters.
[178:16.52]Other Disney characters.
[178:17.52]Just pumped in, please.
[178:28.38]Who's the bad guy in Chip and Dale?
[178:32.01]I've not seen that show in a long time.
[178:33.75]Who's the antagonist?
[178:35.66]What's her name?
[178:40.80]Fat Cat.
[178:41.40]Right.
[178:41.60]Okay.
[178:42.00]It better be Fat Cat.
[178:50.80]Dale is the antagonist.
[178:55.82]Antagonist POV right now?
[178:56.88]Is that what you're saying?
[179:02.18]When there's danger.
[179:10.61]Alright, let's go.
[179:16.87]Who's the boss?
[179:18.79]Batcat, come on.
[179:19.71]No, it's the truck.
[179:23.68]I'm done.
[179:24.94]What's next?
[179:26.46]Let's, uh... Wait, let's stay on the Chippendale page.
[179:28.74]There's something else I wanted to see.
[179:31.99]Hot Blood Wrestle.
[179:33.18]Hot Blood Story, I think, is what we start with first.
[179:40.52]It's just River City Ransom, which is an incredible game for the NES.
[179:48.81]Is it, though?
[179:53.30]It is.
[179:53.48]It's just River City Ransom.
[179:59.06]This game used to scare the shit out of me because when they start chasing you with weapons, it's terrifying.
[180:05.88]I love this game.
[180:06.79]Best part of the game is when you eat the plates.
[180:09.87]I'm getting deja vu right now.
[180:11.11]We did this already, didn't we?
[180:12.23]Didn't I talk about like, oh my god, when you eat the plates, it's so funny.
[180:16.39]Did we do this?
[180:18.87]I played this on stream, didn't I?
[180:24.12]Have I never played River City Ransom on stream?
[180:30.27]Yeah, you go and you buy food and stuff.
[180:32.11]It's awesome.
[180:33.23]Because you eat the whole plate.
[180:34.39]It doesn't matter what it is.
[180:35.09]It could be a coffee.
[180:35.87]It could be sushi or a hamburger.
[180:38.58]It doesn't matter.
[180:39.70]You eat the entire plate.
[180:42.28]Oh, sorry.
[180:42.64]I just spoiled something fun.
[180:43.84]I thought you already saw it.
[180:53.52]Boss time.
[180:54.30]I remember boss comes out of here, right?
[180:55.44]Somebody comes out of here.
[180:58.23]I hate that.
[181:03.66]This game is so good, though.
[181:07.65]Oh, shit.
[181:08.05]Please!
[181:11.89]I need the trash can.
[181:16.85]Alright, here comes the boss.
[181:21.07]He pops out right here.
[181:22.02]Is it right here, or is it after?
[181:24.00]Oh, here we go.
[181:28.14]Okay, yeah.
[181:28.60]Alright, ready to see the fun part?
[181:30.60]Watch this.
[181:33.36]Okay, so I can't see what I'm buying, but... Uh, this.
[181:37.52]I love that so much.
[181:41.35]It's so cool.
[181:43.05]Oh, it's the best.
[181:43.91]You eat the whole thing in one bite, even if it's a plate.
[181:51.71]I love it.
[181:52.07]Where's a coffee?
[181:57.70]Or, like, tea or something.
[181:59.30]Can anybody... Can somebody read this?
[182:07.05]I need a coffee.
[182:07.61]Alright, well, it's just River City Ransom, which I'll play it on your own time.
[182:14.79]It's like one of the best NES games ever made.
[182:16.27]Alright, so what's that?
[182:16.91]What's the next one?
[182:22.75]It's Hot Blood Wrestle.
[182:23.87]I mean, we have to do that. 1993.
[182:39.24]Was there another River City Ransom?
[182:47.43]I don't remember this.
[182:48.65]What is this?
[182:52.81]This is the... Do you guys ever play dodgeball for the NES?
[182:58.95]I love that game so much.
[183:00.19]I hope it's on here.
[183:06.26]It doesn't matter what my name is.
[183:07.28]It doesn't matter.
[183:12.68]Let's go.
[183:15.43]Only in Japan?
[183:16.63]Oh, okay.
[183:16.97]I see.
[183:17.23]I want that to be my name.
[183:20.17]Let's go.
[183:20.61]End.
[183:24.65]Yes?
[183:25.39]Okay.
[183:26.81]I want to be... I suppose it's Fighter, Brawler, Scrapper...
[183:34.87]Alright, I'm going to be Scrapper.
[183:38.25]Scrapper 4.
[183:38.80]I have no idea what just happened.
[183:49.98]Fight!
[183:57.87]Okay.
[183:59.09]I don't even know what character I am.
[184:02.37]Okay.
[184:04.59]Why did you start off with a lightning move?
[184:08.11]How do I do a lightning move?
[184:11.45]Get away from my friend!
[184:20.78]I can't tell who's winning, but I think we're doing okay.
[184:33.13]Oh my god, somebody just gave a shitload of subs.
[184:36.11]Somebody just gave 50 community subs.
[184:40.11]Zapx gave 50 subs.
[184:42.59]That's a fucking ton.
[184:44.39]Too many.
[184:44.95]Too many subs.
[184:45.67]What's this?
[184:45.93]A weapon?
[184:46.51]Did we just sort of pin him?
[184:49.35]Oh, his friend is gone.
[184:50.03]Alright.
[184:54.47]Get him, get him!
[184:58.89]I just killed my own friend.
[184:59.81]Oops.
[185:01.31]What did he leave?
[185:02.01]He left health?
[185:02.67]Holy shit.
[185:06.01]I just got absolutely fucking destroyed.
[185:08.03]Okay.
[185:10.35]Let me... Let me get up.
[185:12.05]Please.
[185:23.32]Oh, the spam is what the game actually is?
[185:25.50]Okay.
[185:25.66]Okay.
[185:30.59]That's it.
[185:34.23]It's a huge pog face.
[185:35.23]That's an Omega Pog.
[185:38.19]Two Omega Pogs.
[185:41.83]This is made by the Guilty Gear devs.
[185:43.37]That's interesting.
[185:43.99]Alright, let's get a random one.
[185:50.99]I love this.
[185:51.61]This is like a bunch of fun.
[185:54.92]It's just a shitty game loot box.
[185:56.94]You just open up a random number.
[186:00.81]Some of them are actually real games.
[186:05.03]Hexapoo Man.
[186:06.73]No, Hexapoo New.
[186:08.11]Alright.
[186:13.51]Hexapoo New.
[186:24.48]Hexapod.
[186:29.28]Presents to start.
[186:30.32]Level 1.
[186:37.32]Uh, is this spray paint?
[186:41.80]What is this?
[186:42.44]It's like a water can?
[186:46.62]Do I have to shoot the ladybug?
[186:51.54]This is kind of cool.
[186:52.20]I like this.
[186:52.54]Alright, I'm going to be here for a minute.
[186:56.09]I won.
[186:56.39]Level 1 complete.
[186:57.49]Presents to start.
[186:59.03]Hexapod.
[187:00.25]Level 2.
[187:03.51]Is this like a centipede, but not a centipede?
[187:06.26]I guess?
[187:12.14]Okay, cool, I guess.
[187:19.10]Oh shit, they're getting close.
[187:21.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[187:24.61]What, am I preventing them from turning into flowers?
[187:26.51]Why is this... This is, like, bad.
[187:28.21]This is bug spray.
[187:38.86]Alright, one more level and I'm done.
[187:41.07]Last one.
[187:53.23]I can't.
[187:54.50]I can't.
[187:54.94]I'm gonna just hit escape right now.
[187:57.82]It's not escape.
[187:58.40]It's reset, actually.
[188:01.92]It's like... This hurts.
[188:05.14]You ever play a game or something and you just need to move your body around because... I just hate... I have to stop.
[188:10.86]Alright, how about... Let's pick a good one.
[188:21.83]Mortal Kombat 4.
[188:27.48]That was Superman.
[188:30.56]Okay.
[188:31.94]I don't even know how many characters.
[188:46.67]Is this a match three game?
[188:48.51]Or is this the character selector?
[188:49.75]I thought it was a match three game.
[188:52.31]Okay.
[188:52.49]Sonia?
[188:58.64]What the fuck?
[189:01.02]Sonya versus Nightwolf.
[189:10.27]It actually is Mortal Kombat, but not at all.
[189:20.03]I'm getting destroyed.
[189:21.39]Okay, so hold on.
[189:22.63]If this is Sonya, who's the other Sonya?
[189:24.91]Because there's like five Sonyas on that character select.
[189:33.76]You know what the best part about this is?
[189:37.30]There's blood.
[189:39.18]They tried to keep it as authentic as possible with, remember, original blood in Mortal Kombat?
[189:45.21]All the parents, all the legislation that was like, this is bad.
[189:47.75]There's blood in this video game.
[189:49.19]It's disgusting.
[189:50.37]It's horrible.
[189:51.71]They kept that.
[190:02.81]I lost.
[190:06.75]Alright, hold on.
[190:07.31]Reset.
[190:09.63]I want to pick another character.
[190:10.89]I want to pick green Sub-Zero and see who it is.
[190:20.26]Where is... What even is this?
[190:25.38]This is Kano.
[190:27.00]This is Sub-Zero, right?
[190:29.54]Isn't this Striker?
[190:38.13]Is this Kratos?
[190:43.68]That's Sub-Zero, right?
[190:48.90]Is that Johnny Cage?
[190:50.12]Johnny Cage has sunglasses.
[190:51.22]I'm gonna be Red Sub-Zero.
[191:02.59]Liu Kang versus Nightwolf.
[191:12.03]I gotta see if I can do the kick.
[191:14.98]What's the button combination to do the actual kick move?
[191:31.05]Just keep him in the corner.
[191:31.79]Wait.
[191:32.49]Can I do the sweep?
[191:36.36]This game doesn't have... Wait.
[191:37.50]It doesn't have the sweep.
[191:47.10]Is there... Wait, we need to see if there's a finisher.
[191:49.08]If there's fatalities in this, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[191:52.76]Up, down, kick.
[192:03.29]Fuck, he just punched me in the face.
[192:04.55]Alright, I'm gonna try to get fatality, dude.
[192:09.73]Wait.
[192:09.95]Is that Shao Kahn?
[192:13.31]Is that what...
[192:15.33]That's not Nightwolf.
[192:20.78]That hasn't been Nightwolf this whole time.
[192:22.02]I was wondering, something felt off about him.
[192:39.37]That's a lot of blood.
[192:40.33]Did I- I won.
[192:51.99]Just had to make sure he was extra dead.
[192:56.11]Fatality.
[192:56.81]Alright, this is Striker.
[192:58.65]Red Striker is who?
[193:01.10]It's just Striker.
[193:01.88]Okay.
[193:12.96]Oh, wait.
[193:17.08]Is that the bicycle kick?
[193:20.85]Forward, forward, punch.
[193:21.57]Forward, forward, kick.
[193:22.37]Forward, forward, kick.
[193:22.89]Back, forward, kick.
[193:23.47]Back, forward, back, back, kick.
[193:24.37]Back, back, kick.
[193:25.23]Back, back, forward, kick.
[193:30.59]Back, back, forward, kick.
[193:32.29]Back, back, forward, kick.
[193:33.93]Back, back, forward, kick.
[193:37.17]Just kill me, whatever.
[193:47.72]Another 15 subs from Scrumpleton.
[193:51.24]Scrumple, thanks for the 15 sub.
[193:52.30]That's a fucking lot of sub.
[193:58.54]A lot of subs right now.
[194:00.66]Alright.
[194:02.10]I don't know what this is, but I'm going to pick it.
[194:11.11]It's just Shang Tsung.
[194:12.23]Alright.
[194:12.71]No, it's not.
[194:13.96]Wait.
[194:14.38]No, it's not.
[194:22.10]I'm gonna get perfect.
[194:23.16]I'm literally about to get perfected.
[194:38.64]I can't even attack him.
[194:41.51]Wait, wait, am I Striker?
[194:42.97]What's happening?
[194:43.59]I just was pressing buttons and Striker's... Who am... I'm not even playing the game.
[194:49.49]I'm not playing.
[194:50.13]I was not playing.
[194:54.63]I was not playing the game.
[194:57.13]There were big bits, too.
[194:58.61]Oh, there was 100 bucks.
[194:59.41]Holy shit.
[194:59.93]Okay.
[195:02.55]Uh, Vilemi, thanks for the $100.
[195:05.19]Although, I don't read bits anymore.
[195:08.28]I do not read bit messages anymore.
[195:10.88]We talked about how I wanted to move away from that.
[195:14.86]And, uh, that's kind of the way it is.
[195:18.30]So, for those of you that don't know, if you might not have been here for a while, I no longer read bits.
[195:24.06]Because it got to a point where I took bits away from the end of the stream.
[195:27.04]I stopped reading them.
[195:27.82]But I still was reading like $100 bits.
[195:31.33]And I find that to be a precedent I do not want to set.
[195:33.79]For people to try to essentially... I don't want to have it be a thing where people give me money and I...
[195:43.36]I'm gonna like read it out loud and I don't want to set that precedence for people to like feel like they have to pay me money like an insane amount of money to try to get me to like read something um I don't want that precedence to be said at all so I stopped reading bits of the uh it used to be 250 and if somebody wants to me to read something I don't want to be like I have to give this guy a hundred fucking dollars or he will not read it so that's something I don't want to have happen
[196:14.76]That's why I kind of stopped reading bits completely.
[196:21.55]Please God, read this.
[196:28.01]You're a wholesome fucker.
[196:30.43]No, I just don't want people to have to drop that kind of money to have me read something, you know?
[196:36.52]I'd rather just pick it out of chat.
[196:40.34]And I still, if somebody gives community subs, I still read them.
[196:42.84]I still just read the fact that they were given, but there's no message attached to like community subs or anything.
[196:47.63]It's just sort of, um, and people get the subs.
[196:51.39]It's not just me receiving like a hundred dollars in bits.
[196:55.95]So that's why the kind of the idea, I just don't ever want it to get to a point where people need to spend an insane amount of money to, and I'll read it.
[197:06.80]He doesn't know how to read.
[197:07.90]No.
[197:12.06]But I do know how to read Bird Week.
[197:17.14]Study the game.
[197:18.14]Alright, I need to study the game.
[197:30.81]Was there to study?
[197:31.53]Oh, is this just not playing the game?
[197:45.89]How is this different than just playing the- How is this studying the game?
[197:48.91]You have to eat the butterflies?
[198:02.25]Why do I keep running into that bird?
[198:03.45]I'm so stupid.
[198:06.47]Speaking of subs, we got 10 from Anonymous, and then 10 from Shock too, so thanks both you guys.
[198:10.67]Oh my god, I'm fucking... Bird Week sucks.
[198:14.29]Although, I wish there was a Bird Week on that Shark Week channel, Discovery.
[198:18.23]We get Shark Week, I don't care about Shark Week, I would want Bird Week.
[198:20.86]I'm more interested in birds.
[198:27.78]Yeah.
[198:28.78]Time for Mario 10.
[198:30.14]Super Mario, Super Brothers Kung Fu Mari.
[198:39.52]Super Mario, Kung Fu Mario.
[198:44.74]When he just jumps up, he's got like a human body.
[198:48.73]Like a, wait, he has a human body, doesn't he?
[198:56.39]That's just this Mario 2, no, Mario 3.
[199:02.12]He's huge, yeah, he's like 6'5".
[199:10.88]There's a knight?
[199:13.98]Lotta random assets in this game.
[199:19.82]You know what's bizarre about this though?
[199:21.08]I really could- I really feel like this could be one of those Mario games that came out 25 years ago for just regular Nintendo or Super Nintendo that nobody talks about, nobody hears about anymore.
[199:33.39]Was that one Mario in Time?
[199:34.89]Like Luigi stuck in time or something?
[199:40.15]Like, there was a Mario Yahtzee game.
[199:41.79]Like, this could be real.
[199:46.63]Mario is missing.
[199:47.52]Yeah, that's one.
[199:47.96]Yeah, right.
[199:48.24]Yeah, that's one.
[199:55.06]A giant tiger!
[200:00.88]Just getting mauled by a tiger in Mario.
[200:10.04]very hyper realistic tiger yeah I wish there were Mario sounds in this they're like whoa
[200:37.63]Losing focus?
[200:38.79]Yeah, my brain has one road.
[200:44.49]It's a one-lane highway.
[200:49.96]It just goes in a straight line.
[200:51.14]If you tell me I need to take a turn off that highway, nope.
[200:56.00]I can't have more lanes.
[200:57.10]It can't be more than one car on that road.
[200:58.45]It's just one fucking road.
[200:59.57]And it's long and it's huge.
[201:08.60]But that car can go 500 miles per hour.
[201:18.46]It's a Lamborghini on that road.
[201:22.90]What Mario character is this?
[201:28.77]It's actually kind of a fun game.
[201:34.01]It was Toad?
[201:35.73]It was Krillin.
[201:37.65]Wait, was it?
[201:38.59]Who was that?
[201:39.21]That person was so small.
[201:40.97]That person was like three times smaller than me and he's jacked too.
[201:44.46]I'm just realizing.
[201:45.10]Uh-oh.
[201:46.56]No, I thought it was a boss.
[201:50.68]Auto-scroller.
[201:51.30]Of course it'd be an auto-scroller in a Mario game.
[201:53.24]Why not?
[201:59.96]Alright, for all the shit talking, it's not even that bad of a designed video game.
[202:04.66]It's not bad.
[202:07.00]It's just a little weird.
[202:10.52]Oh, shit.
[202:11.26]Okay, I'm good.
[202:11.80]Fuck.
[202:21.04]It's scrolling very fast.
[202:22.15]Yeah, it is.
[202:29.47]They even put the in the game.
[202:33.37]I love Mario 10.
[202:34.25]It's my favorite Mario.
[202:42.20]Vertical scroll now.
[202:43.40]Wow, change it up.
[202:45.36]I'm impressed.
[202:46.74]I'm impressed.
[202:55.47]That was a football player.
[202:57.49]Or a soccer player or something.
[203:05.82]Play Mario 7.
[203:06.44]What?
[203:07.38]Uh... Is this a boss fight?
[203:15.88]Oh, it's the thing in Mario 64 in the middle of the pyramid.
[203:38.60]With the hands, you have to stomp on the hands.
[203:42.52]Come on, get him.
[203:46.68]Got it.
[203:59.09]Level two.
[204:00.89]Alright, I'm going to go until I die one more time, and then we'll try the other Mario's.
[204:10.00]Oh shit.
[204:10.64]Okay, I thought it was gonna be a faller.
[204:15.70]Webcam is on.
[204:16.32]What?
[204:16.62]What are you talking about?
[204:20.28]What happened?
[204:20.88]USB.
[204:21.93]Unplugged.
[204:22.99]What happened?
[204:26.13]Something just unplugged?
[204:27.29]I have no idea what that could have been.
[204:40.29]We didn't even look at the cutscene.
[204:41.37]What is this?
[204:44.75]Mario?
[204:45.11]Is that Mario and Peach?
[204:47.33]What the fuck?
[204:54.30]Okay, I have no idea what we just watched, but whatever.
[205:03.60]Mario, like a Donkey Kong Jr.
[205:05.89]man?
[205:07.74]Hold on Donkey Kong jr.
[205:09.82]Ma.
[205:11.00]Donkey Kong jr.
[205:11.80]Math.
[205:13.42]Oh shit, okay Alright, what I mean math What two plus?
[205:22.94]Eight plus What's going on eight plus I
[205:40.21]8 plus 4.
[205:44.53]8 plus 12 is 4.
[205:53.73]I just accidentally did that.
[205:55.03]I have no idea what just happened.
[205:56.95]What happened?
[205:57.39]8 plus what?
[205:57.89]4 times 5 is 20.
[206:00.28]Plus 7.
[206:09.07]It's two.

[206:44.73]8 times... What is it?
[206:46.31]65 plus 1.
[206:46.59]6 times 11.
[206:49.27]Can I do that?
[206:50.21]6 times 11?
[207:05.72]No.
[207:07.58]8 times 6 is what?
[207:09.36]What is 8 times 6?
[207:10.82]66?
[207:11.54]I don't know.
[207:11.98]6 times... I can't do more than one digit, guys.
[207:22.02]8 times 8 is... 8... I don't know.
[207:27.47]11 times 6, I can't do more than one digit.
[207:36.64]Eight.
[207:39.20]Times eight.
[207:41.76]Sixty-four.
[207:46.24]I can't do more than one digit.
[207:49.90]Eight times eight +2.
[207:51.28]Oh, fucking idiot, Jeremy.
[207:58.64]Just gotta get the time symbol.
[208:04.32]eight times eight is 64 +2 no what no stop I I didn't want to touch that reset it reset reset reset seven times seven plus it's weird how you have to touch these things and pick them up
[208:32.40]Chugging the bong water.
[208:33.50]No, no.
[208:34.10]The game is weird.
[208:35.06]If I touch a symbol, if I hit X, it clears.
[208:38.70]It's weird.
[208:39.22]It's a weird symbol.
[208:42.00]It's weird.
[208:52.03]Mario 12.
[208:54.97]Push start.
[208:57.79]Music type.
[209:08.05]Round one.
[209:12.27]It's a match game.
[209:18.78]Holy shit, I just destroyed the entire thing.
[209:24.28]Chef Mario.
[209:27.78]You guys ever think that if Nintendo ever decided to make a theme park,
[209:31.62]Think about all the Marios there would be if you go to Disneyland or Disney World.
[209:35.60]There's Chef Mickey.
[209:36.48]There's Rodeo Mickey.
[209:37.92]There's Magic Mickey.
[209:38.94]Magician Mickey.
[209:40.16]There's Library and Glasses Mickey.
[209:43.35]Now imagine how many Marios there would be.
[209:46.67]You could have a Mario for every occasion.
[209:48.17]Chef Mario.
[209:48.87]They could be like Archeologist Mario.
[209:51.81]Why would they not do that?
[209:54.41]I know there is one, but... Is it like licensed officially by Nintendo?
[210:05.77]It is.
[210:07.61]Yeah, but what's it like?
[210:08.57]It's like two rides and like one little pop-up thing or something.
[210:12.52]I'm talking about like a Disney World for Nintendo.
[210:16.36]Like an entire theme park that's Nintendo.
[210:22.65]Look it up.
[210:25.22]I feel like I'm getting lied to.
[210:27.13]Nintendo Land or Nintendo Park.
[210:30.41]Nintendo Theme Park.
[210:32.21]Super Nintendo World is an upcoming theme park.
[210:36.53]So this doesn't exist yet.
[210:37.50]Okay, thank you.
[210:40.74]Under construction at Universal Studios Japan.
[210:42.62]Oh, it's opening like next week.
[210:49.71]It opens in like less than 30 days.
[210:53.25]Plans exist to bring it to Universal Studios Hollywood in California.
[210:56.67]What the fuck?
[210:57.46]This Super Nintendo World?
[211:01.04]It's opening in like three weeks.
[211:04.68]The theme park is based on the Nintendo video game franchise.
[211:08.57]What?
[211:09.89]At Universal Studios Japan, Super Nintendo World is wedged in the... Wedged.
[211:13.75]I like the whole thing.
[211:17.52]Mario Kart Koopa's Challenge, an interactive dark ride attraction housed in a recreation of Bowser's Castle based on the Mario Kart franchise.
[211:25.85]Oh my god.
[211:28.01]Yoshi's Island, a Yoshi-themed Omnimover with Yoshis.
[211:31.83]Power-up band key challenges.
[211:33.61]A power-up band and the official app are both required to experience the attraction.
[211:38.08]Is it going to be the 1-up factory for dining?
[211:42.42]Kinopio's Cafe for a little bit of shopping?
[211:45.02]Oh my fucking god.
[211:51.54]Nintendo.
[211:55.28]Oh, yeah.
[211:56.28]Oh, yeah.
[211:56.56]It's all about Nintendo coming up.
[211:57.74]Nintendo's going to be the next Disney.
[211:59.67]Just want to make that really clear for you guys.
[212:01.33]Nintendo.
[212:02.23]Next Disney.
[212:03.27]Next Disney fucking world.
[212:04.43]Next huge attractions.
[212:05.75]Huge everywhere.
[212:10.89]Not just video games.
[212:16.15]This is taking a long time for this to come down.
[212:20.33]They come from... Wait, what?
[212:29.08]Fuck Disney and Nintendo, capitalist scum.
[212:34.18]Alright, I'm not gonna play Mario anymore.
[212:41.11]Capitalist scum.
[212:52.09]Jerry.
[212:56.07]George, I don't understand why you're still playing Mario.
[212:59.73]No, they're capitalist scum over there.
[213:01.57]And he's on like, he's got like two, he's got 199.
[213:05.98]George has 199 moons out of 200.
[213:07.94]His eyes are fucking dark.
[213:10.90]He's in the corner.
[213:11.40]There's like Mountain Dew cans all over the place.
[213:15.83]Derry, I just need one more moon.
[213:21.70]And then I'm done with this little bastard forever.
[213:40.77]Recreate an episode of Seinfeld on stream with Dr. Spikeson.
[213:44.17]Why Dr. Spikeson?
[213:46.47]Why does he have to be on that stream?
[213:48.83]I guess he could be, but I mean, why?
[213:52.02]I guess why not?
[213:52.64]Yeah, that's true.
[213:56.14]Alright, this one was fun, but I'm done.
[214:07.73]Do you guys understand that as we get older, sitcoms are going to be that.
[214:16.62]They're going to make these jokes.
[214:20.89]Because when our parents were watching these sitcoms from, you know, 20, 30 years ago, it was exactly what was kind of big and in at the time.
[214:32.17]Whatever was currently, like, the thing that people cared about, 10 to 20 years later, they try to hit the nostalgia on it, too, because they know they're going for a certain audience.
[214:41.00]There's going to be sitcom, like, gamer stuff.
[214:45.12]It's going to be everywhere.
[214:48.73]They already do.
[214:49.37]Oh, no, but it's going to be a major part of almost every single TV show.
[215:00.02]They do now.
[215:01.76]A few do.
[215:02.36]Maybe a few.
[215:05.90]Mario 14.
[215:06.38]This looks like a continuation from...
[215:23.68]Neither of these are Mario.
[215:30.98]That's not Mario either.
[215:31.90]Is that, that's Mario's messenger?
[215:46.05]Wait, what?
[215:54.52]He transformed?
[215:55.54]That's his transformation?
[215:57.04]1993 Wario.
[216:02.34]He grew a little bit.
[216:04.33]They just gave him a Mario head.
[216:06.53]They didn't even try with this one.
[216:07.87]They did not give a fuck with this one at all.
[216:10.55]This is superimposed on whatever game this actually is.
[216:12.85]This is so powerful.
[216:22.21]What's wrong with my guy?
[216:23.07]What's happening?
[216:25.21]Why am I blinking?
[216:29.34]Wario made this.
[216:33.62]Good luck, Mario.
[216:37.32]You'll never beat my Wario game.
[216:54.59]I can't just add Goku to everything with that voice.
[216:57.36]It's gonna get old.
[216:58.10]I can't do that.
[216:59.24]I can't.
[217:02.66]I don't want to burn that.
[217:08.16]That transformation, though, is unbelievable.
[217:17.55]At least, I mean, this is very much the... The turtles are here.
[217:21.05]Are these ice creams?
[217:30.90]I okay that you see that that's where the crack's a little bit there.
[217:36.06]We saw the crack in the armor.
[217:41.39]Literal different character.
[217:42.81]Can I get out of there?
[217:54.07]Forgot to put the sprite in on that one.
[217:55.98]Oh man.
[218:01.23]Get up there.
[218:01.73]This music could be in a Mario game and I would like it.
[218:06.43]Wouldn't you?
[218:06.79]Are they going to serve alcohol at Nintendo Land?
[218:16.99]Very, very important question.
[218:20.10]No?
[218:25.58]I want like a mushroom drink like it's a big mushroom glass and it's like got like some Kahlua and like mint and strawberry and like syrup and stuff.
[218:33.83]I don't know how to do that.
[218:35.33]You can't go one day without drinking.
[218:50.46]I drink like three times a year.
[219:07.12]Interesting.
[219:09.44]Interesting how when you hold B down for long enough, Mario's mustache goes on the back of his head.
[219:26.91]This is fucking hard.
[219:29.03]All that for that.
[219:29.73]Don't die from this.
[219:33.67]No keys?
[219:34.25]What?
[219:35.13]Shit.
[219:35.65]Did I miss a key?
[219:36.25]Where did I miss one?
[219:45.38]Did I jump over it?
[219:46.22]Did I miss it completely?
[219:47.26]I was busy.
[219:49.36]Oh, I was busy.
[219:50.70]I was busy.
[219:51.62]God damn it, I was busy.
[219:55.01]I was busy.
[220:01.87]I was busy and I didn't see it.
[220:06.26]What were you doing?
[220:07.11]I was busy.
[220:08.37]I was looking at something.
[220:16.56]It's two different songs playing at the same time.
[220:18.06]It's freaking me out.
[220:29.28]This game's awesome, though.
[220:30.48]I like this game.
[220:31.18]Just the actual video game.
[220:32.12]Whatever they're copyright stealing.
[220:36.00]Oh, Jesus.
[220:36.70]I'm in trouble.
[220:46.41]Okay, he comes back up to get his... Can I even hurt him?
[220:53.61]I can't hurt him.
[220:54.15]I guess I can.
[221:04.11]I can't even.
[221:05.53]Oh, watch it.
[221:05.97]He's shooting the fireballs.
[221:07.30]How are you supposed to dodge those?
[221:08.78]You cannot get away from that.
[221:12.86]Why are these not hurting him?
[221:13.86]They have to be standing in this corner or I can't hurt him.
[221:24.49]Just jump over them.
[221:25.39]Yeah, but why can't I hurt him?
[221:40.92]God damn it.
[221:46.52]Oh, just jump over him.
[221:47.42]Just jump over him.
[221:49.64]Just jump over those, Jeremy.
[221:51.34]Jump them.
[221:52.56]Jump those.
[221:58.71]Wall jump?
[222:03.99]Wait, I can hold this in the air.
[222:06.09]I have no idea what's going on, dude.
[222:27.27]This might look simple to you, but it's requiring like 7 million math problems for me to not get hit by this stuff.
[222:35.26]Remember, the controller hitting left doesn't work like 45% of the time.
[222:55.89]I don't care.
[222:56.65]It's terrible.
[223:00.11]Blame the controller.
[223:01.23]Blame the controller, not the game right.
[223:02.45]Yeah, I will blame the controller when I hit left.
[223:12.14]Case closed.

[224:50.04]Wait a minute.
[224:52.73]I've played this game a ton.
[224:57.88]I'm getting an insane wave of memories.
[225:04.79]Wait, I've played this.
[225:09.91]Am I insane?
[225:13.72]This is real, right?
[225:22.19]Yeah, for NES.
[225:30.97]The name is from Greek mythology.
[225:34.03]I think.
[225:37.16]I'm a freshman here at Greenview High.
[225:49.85]I don't understand what the dream means.
[225:58.36]And who is that girl?
[226:04.62]The other day, I was walking to school.
[226:08.94]Can we speed the teleprompter up a little bit, please?

[226:27.37]Astyanax!
[226:37.02]Whooo!

[226:42.66]This is Remlia.
[226:44.73]My name is Cutie.
[226:49.73]I brought you to this world.
[226:55.90]What?
[226:56.96]A talking butterfly?
[226:58.74]Very clearly that's like a person with wings on.
[227:02.52]Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you.
[227:11.04]The girl who appears in your dreams is Princess Rosebud of Remlia.
[227:25.15]She is being held captive by the evil wizard, Blackhorn.
[227:37.02]Astonax, please save our princess.
[227:40.64]This is just Astonax.
[227:45.30]But I'm only six.
[227:47.44]I thought I was going to say only six feet tall.
[227:49.32]What does that matter?
[227:50.63]That's like good.
[227:51.21]What are you talking about?
[227:55.71]Astonax, you are the warrior.
[228:01.89]Chosen by this world.
[228:07.09]You possess the wonderful miracle power within you.
[228:17.25]And also, only the princess can send you back to your world.
[228:29.88]I can't do it myself.
[228:34.96]Oh my fucking god.
[228:37.78]Take this magic axe.
[228:40.44]Bash.
[228:42.35]This is the only way you can get back to your world.
[228:50.37]Thank you.
[228:54.23]Blackhorn has many monsters at his command.
[229:02.29]You have no choice.
[229:05.33]I'm sorry.
[229:06.11]Okay then.
[229:12.68]Lead the way.
[229:13.70]Astanax, let's go.
[229:20.98]Astanax!

[233:43.91]No.
[233:44.69]Wait, no.
[233:45.33]Isn't there a... No, the original Batman was kind of purple, wasn't he?
[233:48.97]They talk about in the 60s with Adam West.
[233:50.57]He was purple, right?
[233:51.51]Purple and black and gray.
[233:54.45]Yeah, he was.
[233:54.87]They just didn't add the other two colors.
[233:57.52]That's fine.
[234:02.98]Does that say meat eat?
[234:05.24]Eat re.

[235:38.75]Like, he's completely purple.
[235:47.82]There ain't nothing here but purple.
[235:55.78]He's completely fucking purple!
[236:01.50]Except for the yellow in the middle!
[236:09.03]And why is he on an Elmo phone?
[236:15.45]That's blue.
[236:16.05]That is... That's not blue.
[236:20.49]That's purple.
[236:23.78]That's purple.
[236:24.54]How is that blue?
[236:25.70]You think that's blue?
[236:26.96]Get your sight.
[236:27.44]Get your screen checked.
[236:28.32]Some of you guys need to get your eyeglasses examined.
[236:30.72]That's purple.
[236:35.96]That's lilac.
[236:37.14]Okay.
[236:38.16]Alright.
[236:38.82]I've heard about enough.
[236:41.32]I've heard just about enough.
[236:43.82]It's lilac.
[236:44.96]Oh, shit.
[236:46.06]He exploded.
[236:54.78]Lilac.
[236:57.14]No, it's not purple.
[236:58.07]It's fuchsia.
[237:03.73]No, it's lavender, Jeremy.
[237:15.90]Take the color blind test.
[237:16.88]I already did, and I got 100 on it.
[237:21.23]I got one of the highest scores you could possibly get on that test.
[237:24.71]It was like a 150.
[237:25.29]100% colorblind.
[237:37.56]No.
[237:42.20]Silent!
[237:47.30]Alright, where's the boss?
[237:48.18]I want to see the first boss.
[237:49.46]Penguin, right?
[237:53.79]I don't die.
[237:55.59]Oh, you're actually, you guys are listening.
[238:01.97]Wow.
[238:03.59]Very, very, you guys are very, very good listeners right now.
[238:05.65]That guy was just smoking a cigarette.
[238:11.68]I'm not even sure he was a bad guy, but whatever.
[238:13.10]You're in Batman's way.
[238:13.94]Get out of the way.
[238:16.14]If you see Batman fucking sprinting down...
[238:20.89]You get out of his way.
[238:22.61]I don't know who this is, but it got me.
[238:28.80]I think this is just an extra bad guy.
[238:31.14]This is not like a Batman character.
[238:32.26]Alright.
[238:51.25]It's so, it's fucking so hard.
[238:52.75]Fake fan.
[239:00.34]Am I a fake fan for not knowing who that is?
[239:04.98]Star Force Astro Robo Sasa.
[239:09.68]Yes.
[239:09.92]Sasa.
[239:12.08]Sasa.
[239:19.37]Live-action Batman television series of the 1960s starring Adam West featured a blue, purple, and gray version of the Batsuit with the cape shortened.
[239:25.91]Thank you.
[239:30.80]Uh, what is it?
[239:31.50]What am I doing?
[239:32.08]Um, this doesn't reach.
[239:40.09]Oh.
[240:01.79]I did it.
[240:02.97]This is kind of cool.
[240:07.90]Look at that cow down there.
[240:09.04]Look at how cool that cow is.
[240:11.52]Oh my god, I love this one.
[240:12.94]Look at him.
[240:14.80]He's like, hello, it's me, Mr. Cow.
[240:17.22]I love that cow.
[240:21.59]Got it.
[240:25.43]Can I get the cow too?
[240:31.26]It was a detective comics.
[240:33.52]Yeah, he's purple.
[240:34.80]Come on.
[240:37.52]It's purple, dude.
[240:42.29]Oops.
[240:42.69]Is this the same level?
[240:46.47]Did I not do it?
[240:52.25]Stage four.
[240:52.83]I didn't.
[240:59.33]They get all these E's.
[241:01.67]Destroy the balls leading up to the... Knock the tower down?
[241:07.23]Can I just fly in there?
[241:10.67]Uh, I don't know.
[241:15.75]What do I do?
[241:17.43]Okay.
[241:24.26]I don't know what that does.
[241:28.63]Give me, like, powers?
[241:32.63]Destroy the wall?
[241:39.65]Give me powers.
[241:45.29]Oh, wait.
[241:47.75]What's the point of the balls, then?
[241:48.81]If I can just break this, what's the point of the balls?
[242:03.52]the store pee why of all the things do I have to think about that one
[242:30.71]Nice.
[242:31.53]Ah, yeah.
[242:31.89]That was good.
[242:33.01]That was very good.
[242:36.81]You get that one.
[242:37.99]Absolutely.
[242:46.48]That was very good.
[242:51.03]Alright, this one's cute, but I think I'm done.
[242:55.25]What the hell?
[243:07.57]Yeah, that was fun.
[243:08.11]Let's get a random one.
[243:09.82]2, 3, 4, we're going.
[243:13.10]409.
[243:13.12]Spider-Man 1.
[243:13.94]Okay.
[243:14.30]Stage 1, 3 lives.
[243:20.04]Spider-Man.
[243:20.68]Oh, what?
[243:44.18]Did I... I think I lost.
[243:45.30]Okay, I can... Alright, I get it, I get it.
[243:52.63]So, you gotta climb around.
[243:53.87]This is definitely, uh, Green Goblin's design work.
[244:04.89]I know it.
[244:16.31]This song is awful.
[244:18.73]For Spider-Man.
[244:19.97]This should be way more upbeat.
[244:24.27]This does not feel like Spider-Man music.
[244:26.85]At all.
[244:31.53]And when does this end?
[244:33.80]The enemy has full health.
[244:36.86]What enemy am I supposed to be shooting at?
[244:42.56]Enemy.
[244:43.18]Full health.
[244:49.76]Well, I want to see Spider-Man 2.
[244:56.34]Oh, sorry.
[245:05.74]Different pose.
[245:08.61]And this time we're climbing on the wall.
[245:10.19]Okay.
[245:11.85]That's doll.
[245:12.43]That's Dr. Octopus.
[245:19.07]Okay, I have homing missiles?
[245:21.83]If he touches me, I... Okay, just spam A and you'll win.
[245:28.12]Alright, I beat him.
[245:28.72]Stage 2.
[245:29.54]Doctor Octopus again.
[245:30.44]I guess.
[245:36.06]Oh my god, this is painful.
[245:38.08]Stop doing that.
[245:42.11]Got him.
[245:43.39]Okay.
[245:45.11]Stage 3.
[245:45.53]Doctor Octopus again.
[245:48.36]Are we ever going to see another character?
[245:49.44]There's a glitch right here.
[245:53.40]If you get to the top left part of his shoulder, you can spam it.
[245:57.64]It's the only place you can do that.
[245:58.60]Let's get right up to the top left shoulder area here.
[246:01.82]If he would stop doing that.
[246:08.59]Stage 5, Dr. Octopus.
[246:24.90]I don't think there's anything else.
[246:25.80]I don't think this one has anything else in it.
[246:35.94]Every time he touches you, it resets the whole game.
[246:37.85]Holy shit, this is awful.
[246:41.15]Okay, after stage 10, if it's still Dr. Octopus, I'm leaving.
[246:54.01]Nope.
[246:54.43]Alright.
[246:55.39]Stage 8.
[246:56.23]He has so much health as this goes forward.
[247:06.74]Oh my god.
[247:07.68]Okay.
[247:18.80]Stage 10.
[247:19.14]This has got to be it.
[247:19.86]This has got to be the last one.
[247:28.50]Looks like a stink bug.
[247:29.56]Yeah, he does.
[247:32.54]It's that one spot on the shoulder, though.
[247:34.36]Alright, what if I... Okay, I'm still here.
[247:35.72]I'm going to turn the volume down.
[247:37.66]I need to see what happens after 15.
[247:38.58]I'll get to 20.
[247:47.76]Once I get to 20, that's it.
[247:54.86]Fuck.
[247:55.23]He's shooting more...
[247:59.45]It's 20.
[247:59.85]I'll get 20.
[248:00.27]When we get 20, 20 is over.
[248:01.33]25?
[248:02.93]Well, we'll... Hold on.
[248:18.92]Oh, by the way, I don't have to tap it.
[248:20.54]Hold on.
[248:21.08]If I hold it, it does it too.
[248:22.76]Wait a minute.
[248:29.84]And if I hit the turbo button, what happens?
[248:36.00]No, it's faster without turbo.
[248:37.14]19.
[248:46.87]Last one.
[248:47.23]Okay, this is it.
[248:55.63]This is it.
[248:56.05]Last one.
[248:57.09]I promise.
[249:07.64]He lost a thousand viewers.
[249:08.62]I'm sorry.
[249:09.24]I wanted to see what was going to happen.
[249:10.66]I wanted to see if we got another boss.
[249:15.90]It said do 420.
[249:16.42]Alright, fine.
[249:17.30]I'll do the funny meme number.
[249:22.37]Wonderball.
[249:22.91]A lot of them have the same format here.
[249:31.57]Okay, Wonderball.
[249:32.47]I think I'm winning.
[249:45.69]I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[249:48.17]I'm not controlling anything.
[249:49.71]I'm not shooting that.
[249:50.53]I'm not firing it.
[249:51.17]It's just doing it on its own.
[249:55.11]This is randomly AI-generated music.
[250:01.36]I think this is just a little toy that's fun to look at for kids or something.
[250:06.78]I don't have control of this.
[250:15.53]I don't have control of this.
[250:20.63]I can pause the game.
[250:21.43]How's your Sunday going?
[250:24.89]It's going pretty good.
[250:26.05]Hope your Sunday's going well.
[250:27.35]This is not a video game.
[250:28.43]I can't play it.
[250:32.11]Sing one new wall.
[250:35.37]I don't know the lyrics.
[250:36.07]I just know how it goes.
[250:41.89]Hmm.
[250:42.56]Chubby Cherub.
[250:43.56]Yeah, let's do Chubby.
[250:45.20]Chubby Cherub.
[250:47.90]Uh.
[250:50.94]Um.
[250:51.14]Is this supposed to be Cupid?
[251:00.21]I don't get it.
[251:14.89]Those are the dogs.
[251:17.41]Holy shit.
[251:29.38]The baby got stuck on the power line.
[251:31.46]Oh, no.
[251:33.10]No, no, no.
[251:35.84]Dead fox, gorilla war, gobble, bobble.
[251:38.35]This is... Bubble, bobble, tube.
[251:44.85]Now it is beginning of a fantastic story.
[251:46.83]Let's make a journey to the cave of monsters.
[251:48.91]Good luck.
[251:51.97]Oh, hell yeah.
[251:55.59]It's just Bubble Bobble 2.
[252:02.14]Oh man, I cannot contain the pogs that are coming out of my mouth right now.
[252:07.38]See you in six hours.
[252:12.87]When I'm not streaming.
[252:16.49]I'm probably lying down in my bed.
[252:19.11]In fact, probably an hour from now, I probably will be doing that as well.
[252:22.57]So, I'm not going to see you, though.
[252:28.03]The stream will have been completely ended by then.
[252:30.45]For at least a few hours.
[252:31.44]At least.
[252:37.02]Come on, I gotta get up there.
[252:37.72]Come on, get up there.
[252:45.32]Get up there.
[252:52.36]Oh, wait.
[252:58.24]Do a bed stream to erase the debt.
[253:01.12]I'm not going to do a bed stream.
[253:03.77]How can you not like it?
[253:07.15]It's got candidates.
[253:10.81]What would I do, though?
[253:11.57]Like, what do you want me to do for that?
[253:15.37]Just lie down in bed?
[253:21.60]Sleep.
[253:22.70]I don't think you can do that.
[253:24.56]I can do that if I don't give a notification out, right?
[253:27.59]Aren't you not allowed to sleep on Twitch?
[253:32.65]As long as you don't?
[253:33.97]Something like that.
[253:41.42]Play on the iPad until you get really sleepy.
[253:44.94]Oh, I love the thing.
[253:45.60]Yeah, the slide.
[253:47.04]Best part.
[253:51.18]You watch somebody sleep on Twitch.
[253:52.96]Yeah, but that's like five and a half years ago or something, before like all these rules were in place.
[254:00.22]Yeah, I told you that this dude was sleeping on stream, and somebody was spamming this wicked loud piano in his ears, and he wasn't awake.
[254:07.42]It was like the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.
[254:09.77]He had headphones on.
[254:11.95]And somebody was just spamming this loud smashing on the piano music.
[254:15.73]Just like... It was so loud.
[254:21.96]And this dude's just sitting there with his eyes closed, sleeping with the headphones on.
[254:25.02]I remember just sitting there laughing my ass off, going like, what is going on?
[254:42.88]Like, what happened?
[254:44.60]How did we get here?

[255:44.90]Well, how do I clear the stage?
[255:49.76]Jump into that?

[256:05.16]Yeah, I think I can.
[256:08.52]Can I get them to?
[256:11.24]He sucks.
[256:13.82]Well, the controller sucks.
[256:20.66]I know I an inefficient guy blames his tools.
[256:24.64]No, you blame the shitty controller.
[256:26.18]This is how I control the avatar.
[256:32.57]If you were using a toothbrush to hammer a nail in you would blame the tool.
[256:37.64]I don't understand what's going on.
[256:57.21]Jump from below?
[257:02.36]I just pressed left six times and I didn't move left.
[257:04.99]It's time to get very angry.
[257:06.29]Can I go up this way?
[257:06.93]I'm done.

[257:59.23]Dreamer can't beat Bubble Bobble and thinks Batman is purple.
[258:07.07]He is purple.
[258:16.54]I like this one, though.
[258:17.18]Can I jump on him?
[258:24.90]Lilac, lilac, lilac, lilac.

[258:50.43]Mine's teal.
[258:52.65]Or aqua.
[258:54.25]Aqua's my favorite.
[258:56.81]I don't think that's an actual color.
[258:58.29]I think that's just me saying that.

[278:19.66]I'm gonna just try to get to the end as fast as I can.
[278:22.68]I don't like this.
[278:23.50]I hate it.
[278:26.56]Nice.
[278:39.19]Nice.
[278:50.44]Alright, is this the end?
[278:51.06]This game was made for you, dude.
[278:55.31]I mean, it was... Is it time to fly?
[279:00.21]Is it a shooting level?
[279:01.39]Side-scroller?
[279:07.33]I can't fly the plane, though.
[279:09.30]All I can do is jump?
[279:13.46]You're flying pretty low to the ground.
[279:19.17]He's direct hitting the plane.
[279:20.49]Isn't that bad?
[279:39.43]What the fuck is that?! !
[279:53.60]Alright, Pikachu.
[279:54.30]Ninja Gaiden 1, 2, 3.

[280:59.19]I don't know which character I am.
[281:00.17]I don't know what character I am.
[281:11.48]Long jump.
[281:19.73]Alright, can everybody just settle down and I didn't go very far, but I went real high.
[281:30.17]That has to count for something.
[281:31.33]That breaks a vertical record.
[281:32.75]That's not bad.
[281:47.57]Come on!
[281:53.78]The angle's too high.
[282:03.00]Is that it?
[282:03.42]Hurdles.
[282:05.54]Oh fuck.
[282:22.26]My fucking hand hurts.
[282:25.93]I can't do it anymore.
[282:27.13]I can't.
[282:27.51]My hand hurts.
[282:35.60]I have to play one player B. What's that mean?
[282:41.88]Am I up top now?
[282:42.96]I wonder if it's two.
[282:43.64]Can I do A and B?
[282:44.66]Hit the turbo button.
[282:46.80]Oh, that's right.
[282:48.56]I could just hold turbo.
[282:57.28]That's so unfair.
[283:01.56]See you later, everyone.
[283:07.81]Hey, I qualified.
[283:10.46]This time I came back with... He's doing drugs.
[283:13.90]Long jump, sure.
[283:19.82]Fuck, I'm going too fast.
[283:24.61]Slow down a little, just a little.
[283:29.45]It's so hard to get that when you're going this fast.
[283:34.09]I'm gonna not qualify because I'm too, like, roided out.
[283:42.45]Oh my god.
[283:43.45]Come on, man.
[283:44.54]Really?
[283:51.04]Disqualified.
[283:51.83]Go home.
[283:52.61]You lose.
[283:56.13]Hold on.
[283:56.53]I'll get it.
[284:15.77]Pikachu is 582?
[284:17.09]Alright, I'll get it after this.
[284:18.45]I promise.
[284:18.85]Play B-Wings?
[284:33.63]Okay, I broke all the records.
[284:36.24]They don't even have an indicator back here.
[284:46.37]I just wanted to show you how high I could go.
[285:00.90]Better than the first one?
[285:02.40]Nope.
[285:08.33]Long jump completed.
[285:09.29]What's the next one?
[285:10.09]Hurdles, right?
[285:10.67]Okay.
[285:11.63]I might fuck this up because I'm going to go too fast.
[285:28.71]Even still, he's right behind me.
[285:36.78]Stop letting lizard people play in the Olympics.
[285:39.88]Javelin throw.
[285:40.64]Okay.
[285:51.85]It's still going up.
[286:01.03]Stop letting lizard people play in the Olympics.
[286:03.85]Alright, I'm going to do this one for real.
[286:06.17]Didn't even use turbo for that one and I still got it.
[286:26.48]Oh, that's going to be good.
[286:27.40]That's a line drive, dude.
[286:30.46]Over 100.
[286:32.34]Yep.
[286:32.72]Did I win?
[286:44.69]Wait, why was I just running... Wait, why am I... I'm not in first place?
[286:48.53]How?
[286:48.83]Another 100 meter dash?
[287:09.86]I just got the world record.
[287:14.64]Oh, I got the world record like 10 minutes ago.
[287:17.12]Okay.
[287:19.12]Oh, this is all I have.
[287:20.92]Alright.
[287:25.11]Oh, he looks like he went down into the clubhouse and we didn't see him for about 25 minutes.
[287:34.69]He came back.
[287:39.40]He beat his previous record.
[287:40.76]Oh, damn it.
[287:54.64]Oh, well.
[287:55.16]Okay, who cares?
[287:55.82]Alright, Pikachu.
[287:57.74]Pikachu.
[288:08.16]582, you say?
[288:09.92]Pikachu.
[288:13.34]Pikachu!
[288:18.92]It's like Tetris or something.
[288:22.26]It's fucking Tetris.
[288:29.62]This one.
[288:33.53]Is this Tetris with Pikachu in the shower?
[288:36.95]What's this sound?
[288:39.13]Not bad.
[288:51.52]Not bad, guys.
[288:53.36]This is gonna be huge.
[289:03.23]It's going to be unbelievable.
[289:06.32]Oh, it's going to be unbelievable.
[289:10.22]What do I do?
[289:10.70]What do I do?
[289:11.02]What do I do?
[289:11.38]What do I do?
[289:14.94]Oh my god, it's going to be unbelievable.
[289:18.78]Um...
[289:31.89]And then we're gonna get an L. And drop it in there.
[289:34.03]Watch this shit.
[289:36.19]Oh my god.
[289:37.25]Oh my god.
[289:38.03]Oh my god.
[289:39.78]Oh my god.
[289:40.86]Relax.
[289:43.48]Children play this game.
[289:45.56]Oh shit.
[289:46.06]I blew it.
[289:49.78]Oh.
[289:50.66]Oh my god.
[289:54.37]We're doing that tomorrow.
[290:05.34]People that do question marks, okay.
[290:06.84]That's fine.
[290:07.18]If you have no idea what I'm talking about, that's fine.
[290:10.10]We'll see you tomorrow.
[290:22.09]Yeah, the Burger King Whopper Eat video.
[290:26.20]Remember?
[290:28.56]Well, even if you don't remember, it doesn't matter.
[290:30.04]That's what we're doing tomorrow.
[290:36.86]Every time I take a bite, I have to do the thing.
[290:39.17]You'll just, you'll see.
[290:40.59]You'll see, you'll see.
[290:41.73]I'll see you tomorrow.
[290:42.37]I don't know what to do with this.
[290:55.17]Shit, I need a long stick.
[290:59.47]I need a long stick, please.
[291:02.79]I need a long stick, please.
[291:05.05]There it is.
[291:06.75]Finally.
[291:07.23]Took you long enough.
[291:14.08]Idiot.
[291:14.36]You idiot.
[291:15.78]Alright, so is Pikachu playing or is Pikachu watching me play?
[291:23.80]Which one is it?
[291:24.22]Okay.
[291:31.36]Oh, I'm so upset about that.
[291:33.39]I'm moving.
[291:34.95]Alright, so now what are we doing now?
[291:39.29]I have a question for you guys.
[291:40.07]Do you guys want to see this again?
[291:41.43]I feel like there's still like 200 or 300 we have not seen.
[291:45.25]You guys want to see this again?
[291:49.40]I think we could tap back into this for fun.
[291:52.84]There's a lot more to do.
[291:55.34]Maybe like later this week or next week or something.
[291:58.86]I got to play Popeye.
[292:03.52]Is it just Donkey Kong?
[292:04.16]Maybe do it after the burger tomorrow.
[292:09.53]Okay, he throws bottles at you.
[292:15.57]We'll see.
[292:17.31]I can't punch him in the face.
[292:20.28]What's the point of being Popeye if I can't punch guys in faces?
[292:34.68]I need spinach.
[292:36.38]I do?
[292:36.64]Oh, if you collect the hearts.
[292:43.26]Spinach over here?
[292:43.72]Oh, it's just Pac-Man.
[292:52.64]Get back here!
[292:54.56]You need to look up the stairs?
[292:59.95]He didn't know where to go?
[293:00.91]How?
[293:02.49]Holy shit, I just got the ultimate bonus.
[293:05.71]I didn't know what I was doing.
[293:11.41]What happened?
[293:11.85]I've been having fun with this, though.
[293:20.42]It's just like a... It's just a charcuterie board.
[293:24.18]I love it.
[293:24.52]Alright, let's do a few more.
[293:27.52]What do you think?
[293:28.66]Where should we go?
[293:33.47]We gotta do spy versus spy.
[293:35.56]We looked at that five hours ago.
[293:42.04]Mario 7?
[293:42.46]Didn't I already do Mario 7?
[293:44.50]Training.
[293:47.51]Bag anyone.
[293:49.11]The other is bag, papers, key, passport, and money.
[293:53.37]Um... What?
[294:09.46]I don't know what's going on.
[294:12.90]I thought that was funny, I guess.
[294:17.52]I'm going to put a bomb in the dresser.
[294:21.23]Oh, it's funny that I moved the...
[294:34.39]Alright, I put a bomb in the painting.
[294:44.08]When he goes to the painting now, he's going to get exploded.
[294:51.64]I have the bomb.
[294:52.32]I really don't have any idea what's going on, but that was fun.
[295:12.15]How about... Scoon?
[295:16.81]How about just Mario?
[295:23.55]I mean... This looks like Mario.
[295:28.98]It is Mario.
[295:29.96]Yeah, okay.
[295:30.54]So this is just Mar- but it's not though.
[295:33.16]It's off.
[295:34.48]The colors are wrong.
[295:41.23]What's the... There's going to be a big kicker here somewhere at the end.
[295:48.37]It's just Mario.
[295:53.48]The sound is a little weird too.
[295:59.22]It's got a purple background.
[296:00.82]It's got a nice Batman background.
[296:05.91]Yeah, it looks really like... It looks really crusty too.
[296:15.61]DMCA.
[296:16.53]Okay, but what's the... Okay, hold on a minute here.
[296:19.89]What's the legality here?
[296:22.09]Are there any lawyers in chat?
[296:25.69]So, I bought this.
[296:26.93]This was a console that I purchased, and I'm streaming it on Twitch.
[296:32.06]I technically bought this, and it was sold to me.
[296:40.44]And I'm playing this console that I purchased on stream, but it's Super Mario Brothers, which is definitely not licensed by Nintendo.
[296:47.56]I have no idea.
[297:02.13]What's the legality?
[297:07.23]This is the FBI.
[297:08.33]You're in deep shit.
[297:13.94]It's just Mario Brothers 1.
[297:15.40]It's just Super Mario Brothers.
[297:16.61]You're going to get the electric chair.
[297:21.93]I'm sitting in the electric chair.
[297:28.89]I'm like, God damn.
[297:30.53]I'm sorry.
[297:31.09]I'm sorry, everybody.
[297:31.89]I didn't mean to stream Super Mario Brothers on the bootleg family computer system.
[297:37.92]Tell everybody.
[297:38.34]Tell my mother I love them.
[297:41.34]Phone rings.
[297:42.42]The governor calls.
[297:46.06]End up letting me go because the governor's favorite video is the shpee video.
[297:56.89]Thank God.
[298:01.43]I was a big fan of that shpee nest video.
[298:06.87]It made me laugh.
[298:13.22]You get to live.
[298:15.41]As long as you make the Shpee Nest 3.
[298:19.86]After Otto's Big Adventure 3.
[298:22.00]On the main channel.
[298:24.38]He slams the fucking phone down.
[298:29.21]And I look over at the executioner and I go... Flip the fucking thing.
[298:35.91]And he goes...
[298:51.46]Stop playing bad Mario.
[298:54.00]It just looks so bad.
[298:57.11]I'm looking at the preview because what I get through the feed is a little different.
[299:00.55]It looks really bad for you guys.
[299:03.35]Okay, B-Wings.
[299:04.13]Alright, B-Wings, B-Wings.
[299:05.07]I'm just playing Mario Brothers.
[299:06.21]Yeah, let's do something about B-Wings.
[299:09.57]You got a number?
[299:11.15]Turn off the upscaler.
[299:13.29]That's definitely not the problem.
[299:14.77]It just looks horrible.
[299:17.41]Mario 7.
[299:18.15]Mario 7.
[299:18.83]Let's Mario 7.
[299:20.09]We got a number from Mario 7?
[299:27.37]What about Mario Brothers?
[299:32.22]We all know this one.
[299:34.92]Mario 7 is 66.
[299:42.10]Dead fox.
[299:49.64]He's naked.
[299:51.06]Um, okay.
[299:52.24]Okay, this is, uh, is this filled with murder?
[300:14.75]Am I actually naked?
[300:15.77]No.
[300:18.31]Why are they disintegrating?
[300:21.60]They're crumbling.
[300:23.62]They just disappear.
[300:32.09]What am I shooting them with?
[300:38.87]I'm trying to get better aerodynamics by jumping like this.
[300:43.09]I saw this on some fucking YouTube video.
[300:48.62]Oh.
[301:00.06]I'm done with this one.
[301:01.12]Where is Mario 7?
[301:09.77]Airwolf Power Blade Bruce Lee 2.
[301:14.83]300 something?
[301:21.19]333?
[301:22.39]No, that's... I can remember.
[301:23.33]334?
[301:26.11]No.
[301:26.69]Aladdin 3.
[301:31.80]This Mickey Mouse.
[301:33.38]Mystery.
[301:34.16]Friday the 13th.
[301:34.64]There's so many more to play.
[301:38.12]I have to play this again.
[301:41.31]334, 334.
[301:41.39]Hakuto no Ken.
[301:41.87]Oh, I can move.
[302:09.73]In what world does any video game go right to left?
[302:17.90]What was that?
[302:26.33]What was that?
[302:26.61]What was that little guy?
[302:34.68]The building behind me looks like when you take an NES cartridge that's dirty and put it in not far enough into the NES.
[302:44.68]And then turn any game on.
[302:46.64]Looks horrible.
[302:55.17]It's a good boomer joke.
[302:56.09]Okay, thanks, man.
[302:56.85]Appreciate it.
[302:58.91]Got a lot of those.
[303:01.67]Okay, why did you want me to play this?
[303:02.67]This game sucks.
[303:07.26]Where'd that guy even come from?
[303:08.17]You guys are falling out of the sky now.
[303:11.71]Okay.
[303:14.77]This game gets good.
[303:15.77]Okay.
[303:16.99]I'll take your word for it here.
[303:17.91]Hey, what should I eat tonight?
[303:22.05]What do you guys think?
[303:24.33]Is this like a pizza?
[303:26.16]Like a cookie?
[303:27.22]I like to call that a cookie-zza, you know?
[303:33.30]Oh, I'm eating a Whopper tomorrow.
[303:37.03]Grilled cheese?
[303:37.61]No.
[303:37.73]How about pasta?
[303:47.10]Hmm.
[303:50.94]How does this game get good?
[303:52.74]I feel like it's the same things going on here.
[303:56.12]What is there to get good here?
[304:02.40]How would you even know that?
[304:03.30]You've never played this.
[304:04.14]I guarantee you've never played this.
[304:05.26]Nobody here has played this game.
[304:06.26]I guarantee it.
[304:09.55]How'd you know?
[304:10.01]Alright, it got good.
[304:22.84]It got better.
[304:23.30]It got good.
[304:33.25]Alright, let me find Mario 7.
[304:34.99]Wherever that is.
[304:37.93]Mario 7, Mario 7.
[304:39.01]I'm going.
[304:39.53]I'm going for it.
[304:40.39]I'm not going to play anything else besides Mario 7, I promise.
[304:43.86]10-yard fight, though.
[304:46.30]Come on.
[304:53.25]Mario Brothers.
[304:55.35]Muscle.
[304:59.71]Hackman.
[305:00.45]Fruit Pig.
[305:05.66]I remember Fruit Pig.
[305:06.30]It was awesome.
[305:08.77]Mag Max.
[305:11.13]Route 16.
[305:12.07]Tetris Volleyball.
[305:20.64]I don't know.
[305:22.78]Where is it?
[305:26.44]388.
[305:26.64]That's not it.

[306:40.52]Apple.
[306:41.38]No, I keep going over them.
[306:42.54]I'm done.
[306:42.78]Alright, let's do one more.
[306:47.82]What's the last one?
[306:48.78]I'm going to play this again.
[306:49.84]Don't worry.
[306:50.59]Eventually, we'll see all at least maybe two-thirds of these.
[306:55.39]What's the last one?
[306:58.21]Mystery?
[306:59.69]Oh, no, no.
[307:00.05]I want to do Friday the 13th.
[307:01.11]You're right.
[307:02.19]We're doing two more.
[307:04.77]And then I'm just going to spam it and then close my eyes and then open them and press A. Alright, where's Friday the 13th?
[307:13.46]Yeah, it was way earlier than this.
[307:27.03]One... No, that's Mario. 331?
[307:33.89]Alpha Mission?
[307:34.61]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[307:35.52]It's alphabetical?
[307:36.54]Uh, it's not.
[307:38.12]It's alphabetical for the first two pages.
[307:40.80]And then it does not, this does not look alphabetical to me.
[307:43.64]Friday the 13th.
[307:44.26]Uh, I believe this is just the game.
[307:56.24]Yeah, it is.
[307:56.81]Crystal Lake Camp.
[307:59.33]I actually remember this game being really good.
[308:05.07]Use the torch to light the fireplace.
[308:07.25]Yeah, it's like Maniac Mansion, right?
[308:11.57]This game's awesome, actually.
[308:12.55]Torch.
[308:15.11]Children.
[308:17.13]I mean children.
[308:40.86]Wait, can't Jason be in these rooms and stuff?
[308:44.42]It's scary.
[308:45.04]This is a scary game.
[308:59.06]Purple Jason?
[308:59.90]He might be.
[309:03.73]I have the torch.
[309:08.65]There it is.
[309:09.75]Like the torch?
[309:10.33]Alright, I lit it, right?
[309:12.49]Now what?
[309:20.57]QR.
[309:21.66]Change.
[309:28.04]Change.
[309:30.52]Change.
[309:33.74]Change!
[309:38.29]Why can't I change?
[309:38.91]He's in the chimney.
[309:42.31]This is an insanely awful fucking game.
[309:44.09]What are you talking about?
[309:44.81]I just remember Jason.
[309:51.10]How do I get out of here?
[309:55.80]Change.
[309:57.10]I'm pressing change and it won't let me change.
[310:00.61]Start.
[310:01.07]Select.
[310:04.55]What happened to the door?
[310:18.24]They weren't zombies.
[310:18.98]I ain't getting lost in another one of these.
[310:26.84]I'm gonna just go find Jason and throw CDs at his head.
[310:40.57]Where is he?
[310:41.03]This game was developed by Atlas?
[310:50.97]Is that Jason right there?
[310:51.65]Oh, he's got a knife.
[310:54.31]I thought he was hiding in the bush, in the tree, with a knife in his hand.
[311:03.87]So many hours wasted on this damn game.
[311:08.45]Where the hell was this?
[311:10.01]Oh, I found the children!
[311:10.89]Can I save the children?
[311:12.47]How do I save them?
[311:16.60]Cure.
[311:16.92]Take.
[311:24.74]How do I take them?
[311:26.64]How do I help them?
[311:29.00]Oh, good luck.
[311:32.24]That got scarier for no reason.
[311:45.37]I just want to find Jason.
[311:46.31]I don't even... I just want to see him.
[312:06.68]He's purple Jason.
[312:08.06]He better be, or I'm going to be really pissed off.
[312:09.89]388 is a casino game.
[312:16.47]Let's check it out.
[312:18.47]Light this.
[312:19.15]Okay, I lit it.
[312:19.99]So now what the hell?
[312:21.37]I did what you told me to do.
[312:25.71]I played your dumb little game.
[312:26.85]Now, what do I do now?
[312:39.45]Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[312:47.30]You're stuck.
[312:50.58]I feel like I am.
[312:51.44]Fuck!
[312:54.05]He's fucking purple.
[313:09.94]He's purple.
[313:12.64]I thought you guys were kidding.
[313:13.60]He actually is purple.
[313:16.40]Alright, one more.
[313:17.56]One more.
[313:18.16]One more.
[313:18.46]What was it?
[313:19.42]It was going to be something.
[313:27.38]388.
[313:27.70]Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[313:29.84]388.
[313:32.68]Li Ma Xin Dian.
[313:37.28]Oh boy, it's like Shrek and Mario together.
[313:39.80]What the hell is going on?
[313:48.71]What'd I land on?
[313:50.89]You win.
[313:52.21]I didn't bet anything.
[313:54.07]I win zero.
[313:57.25]What?
[313:57.81]Wait, hold on.
[314:06.81]Going all in on Cherry.
[314:11.09]What's going on with his teeth?
[314:12.73]Alright, all in on Cherry.
[314:14.85]Let's go.
[314:15.11]Alright, let's go.
[314:25.98]Cherry, I did it.
[314:27.52]How much did I just win?
[314:32.85]This is not worth anything.
[314:33.67]That's just times two.
[314:34.89]What?
[314:39.04]We're gonna go in on bar.
[314:40.20]All in on bar.
[314:51.55]I got an ace?
[314:55.11]Okay, what is... Let's see, the seven... I don't even know which one of these is gonna... These are all tied to a different button on the controller.
[315:04.57]I wanna find bar.
[315:09.48]There is no bar.
[315:10.04]We're just gonna have to go all in on seven.
[315:21.03]Go.
[315:28.22]Apples, fuck.
[315:47.63]So I understand that you get money for doing this, but... This is just it.
[315:53.67]There's nothing to do with this.
[315:55.81]There's no goal or anything.
[315:56.79]It's just... There's nothing to strive for.
[316:06.24]That one sucks.
[316:09.00]Alright, 453.
[316:09.62]Alright, we'll end on 453.
[316:10.67]What is 453?
[316:15.79]Didn't we do this already?
[316:18.47]We already did this one.
[316:20.05]No.
[316:20.25]Alright, I'm going to pick a random one.
[316:23.75]Here we go.
[316:24.07]Closing my eyes and spamming the button.
[316:28.92]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[316:33.36]One, two, three, four.
[316:35.84]And then I'm gonna go down.
[316:37.94]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[316:40.06]Secret castle.
[316:43.70]Milan's secret castle.
[316:45.00]This looks pretty good.
[317:04.09]Uh... I can go in the door.
[317:06.54]I saw it in my eye.
[317:11.58]These windows are in really, really weird places.
[317:13.12]This game is very cryptic?
[317:25.08]Pepe hands?
[317:34.37]Can I jump on these guys?
[317:36.41]No.
[317:36.83]How do I get up there?
[317:42.68]This game is confusing as shit.
[317:44.12]Good luck.
[317:44.54]Okay.
[317:46.94]Maybe I need an extra power?
[317:48.18]I didn't even play B-Wings.
[317:52.79]You're right.
[317:53.17]I have two dollars.
[318:06.19]I can't leave.
[318:06.67]Um, so I have to get up there somehow.
[318:13.71]There has to be a way for me to get up here.
[318:25.91]Is this a spring?
[318:29.81]Looks like it could be a spring.
[318:38.65]I don't understand.
[318:45.79]I guess I need a higher jump?
[318:51.43]I kind of wanted to die.
[318:52.25]Um, alright.
[318:55.93]That was a game that I don't want to ever play again.
[319:00.39]I would play the final game on the list.
[319:01.91]That's true.
[319:02.31]Okay, the final game is Baseball New.
[319:09.57]And then B-Wings.
[319:11.81]And then I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[319:18.38]Did I just pitch the ball back to him?
[319:23.46]I don't know if it's me at the plate.
[319:25.32]Who's... Is it me hitting?
[319:30.68]No, I'm pitching.
[319:31.50]Okay.
[319:32.84]Get it back to the pitcher.
[319:42.48]Why does he put on pajamas?
[319:48.60]Get it!
[319:49.86]Why would the pitcher go field that ball?
[320:15.13]They wait till the ball is done before they start to field the ball.
[320:19.31]I will never get an out.
[320:24.88]I cannot move.
[320:25.66]Alright, B-Wings.
[320:36.28]You had a number for B-Wings?
[320:41.52]Let me see what Bruce Lee 2 is first.

[321:43.02]That guy is because he's purple.
[321:45.76]I wonder who's going to stand up.
[321:48.36]Not the guy that was gray, of course.
[322:01.26]I love this game.
[322:03.54]Boss battle.
[322:04.44]Alright, let's go.
[322:05.56]Let's hear from Kiss.
[322:11.75]That was very, very brutal.
[322:14.27]Okay.
[322:14.77]Well, I'm going to try that one more time.
[322:33.58]They all run away with a big guy shows up.
[322:35.16]Alright, let's go.
[322:47.59]I'll take it.
[322:58.46]I did it.
[322:58.98]That's not Richard Simmons.
[323:09.78]Another text message.
[323:14.41]You can do a full playthrough?
[323:15.69]No way.
[323:17.37]I'm about to turn it off in five seconds.
[323:21.47]There is a jump.
[323:22.21]I wasn't pressing it.
[323:31.96]I can't kick him in the ear.
[323:32.80]I played Milk Nuts already.
[323:37.70]I did.
[323:46.24]Alright, B wings.
[323:47.44]I need a number.
[323:48.86]And then we're going to end the stream.
[323:51.34]B wings.
[323:52.56]B wings.
[323:53.30]B wings.
[323:53.92]What was it?

[323:58.27]What was it?
[324:01.95]And we're in the 500s?
[324:02.49]Okay.
[324:06.43]B wings.
[324:09.03]Golf.
[324:11.50]Ghost.
[324:13.36]Warplayer Mahjong.
[324:16.45]Mario.
[324:18.93]Othello.
[324:19.51]Pac-Man.
[324:22.93]B-Wings.
[324:23.43]There it is.
[324:23.79]Okay.
[324:31.84]Select.
[324:32.28]Cannon.
[324:32.94]Fire.
[324:33.76]Dyna.
[324:35.40]Jump.
[324:37.01]Hammer.
[324:39.03]Anti.
[324:39.61]Side.
[324:40.45]Van.
[324:40.91]I'm going to do...
[324:45.82]I'm gonna go with Dyna.
[324:51.44]Oh shit, this looks fun.
[324:54.54]Ooh!
[324:58.75]Whoa!
[324:59.15]Where'd they go?
[325:00.31]Where'd my sides go?
[325:02.13]I lost my sides!
[325:07.23]Is the plane falling down?
[325:13.76]Oh my god, my sides.
[325:15.34]It looks like it's probably a dodge.
[325:30.57]It's pretty fun.
[325:31.09]This is a real game, I would assume, right?
[325:34.49]Kind of has to be.
[325:43.38]My god, dude, my sides.
[325:45.08]This is the most powerful weapon in the whole game?
[325:54.09]Seems pretty good.
[325:57.19]Nice ship?
[325:57.67]Hey, thanks.
[326:15.10]Ooh, this is cool.
[326:17.58]No, no, no, no, no.
[326:18.12]Give back, give back, give back.
[326:19.06]I just let it go.
[326:20.46]And there's probably a boss right here.
[326:28.81]Ugh.
[326:30.49]Shit.
[326:30.65]Alright, I want to do wide.
[326:38.22]Yeah, I like wide.
[326:49.14]This is a fun shooter, though.
[327:00.19]I got two.
[327:01.17]There was a lot going on there.
[327:02.57]What about Hammer?
[327:06.74]It's Hammer.
[327:11.04]A little shield, that's cool.
[327:12.18]Kind of an annoying sound, but it's alright.
[327:21.18]If I do play this again, I'm going to plug the other controller in.
[327:23.56]I might get another controller for this somehow.
[327:27.31]There's two controllers, but I've tried them both.
[327:29.57]They both have the same left issue.
[327:37.37]Hammer's pretty sick.
[327:40.03]The shield around you is actually pretty useful.
[327:43.75]Excuses.
[327:44.37]I know.
[327:45.63]Excuses, Andy.
[327:48.41]What happened to my ship?
[327:56.45]Don't get killed now.
[327:59.62]He's almost dead.
[328:04.08]Get it.
[328:04.70]Come on.
[328:08.06]Nice.
[328:11.51]This is a good game.
[328:19.08]Can't select.
[328:33.18]Oh, that's alright.
[328:38.17]Alright, that was fun.
[328:41.03]That was an actually good game to end too.
[329:07.38]This is... What happened?
[329:11.03]Alright.
[329:12.19]That's it.
[329:12.69]That's it.
[329:13.17]That was the last one.
[329:14.88]We'll get into this some other time.
[329:17.46]I do like this little console though.
[329:18.62]We can play more stuff.
[329:24.76]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[329:25.56]I'll see you tomorrow.
[329:26.90]Tomorrow, uh, we're gonna open up.
[329:28.32]It's gonna be the Burger King stream.
[329:30.46]I have absolutely no affiliation with Burger King.
[329:34.15]Zero.
[329:34.83]None.
[329:35.07]I just have to do this.
[329:37.71]Tomorrow.
[329:39.17]I'm gonna eat a Whopper on stream, and...
[329:43.05]We thought it was funny like two or three weeks ago when we first talked about it.
[329:47.97]You might not think it's funny at all, but I kind of do.
[329:50.97]I'm going to eat a Whopper on stream and just do like a pretend like, look, I'm trying out Whopper Burger King stuff video.
[329:58.76]I don't know.
[329:59.26]We thought it was funny like three weeks ago.
[330:00.57]We'll see if it's still funny tomorrow.
[330:10.11]Whopper watch.
[330:11.31]Whatever.
[330:11.63]It doesn't matter.
[330:12.19]What are we going to do after that?
[330:13.93]I have no idea.
[330:15.89]This was the plan for today.
[330:19.44]Maybe I will just jump back on this tomorrow.
[330:20.94]It's already set up.
[330:22.90]We'll see.
[330:26.36]Then we can kind of close the book on this thing.
[330:29.20]Maybe.
[330:29.74]We'll see.
[330:33.62]What time tomorrow?
[330:34.72]Probably around the same time.
[330:35.84]Probably around 3 o'clock Pacific.
[330:37.72]3 p.m.
[330:38.86]Pacific is probably a better bet.
[330:42.64]I'll see you tomorrow.
[330:44.26]Thanks for watching, guys.
[330:46.44]As always, hope you had a good New Year's.
[330:48.24]My New Year has started pretty well, so.
[331:01.93]Wayne Radio TV.
[331:03.07]Alright, let's go.
[331:03.85]We're going to raid Wayne.
[331:05.55]We're going to raid.
[331:07.08]I can't say R and then W. We're going to raid Wayne Radio TV tonight.
[331:14.70]I saw the fridge joke and I was like, that's fucking funny.
[331:16.97]Okay?
[331:17.43]I saw the fridge joke.
[331:18.29]I did.
[331:18.69]And it was fucking... It was beautiful.
[331:25.69]So let's do that.
[331:31.93]I did say I was going to raid Wayne like four and a half months ago.
[331:39.57]Here we are.
[331:40.21]Four and a half months late.
[331:46.93]Did I spell that right?
[331:47.85]I did, right?
[331:48.93]It's Wayne Radio TV, right?
[331:53.39]He missed his fucking birthday.
[331:54.77]I don't know what his birthday is.
[331:56.03]Alright, goodnight guys.
[332:01.27]I'll see you tomorrow.
[332:02.07]Around 3 o'clock Pacific.
[332:03.95]Take care of yourselves.
[332:04.55]Go raid Wayne.
[332:05.57]Say hello.
[332:06.17]Say happy birthday to him.
[332:07.07]Say happy belated birthday.
[332:08.03]See you later.
[332:12.46]Goodnight.
[332:12.78]Goodbye.
