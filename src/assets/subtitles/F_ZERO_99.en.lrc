[ve:60.16.100]

[00:11.39]Perfect timing.
[00:12.19]Oh, I didn't have any music playing.
[00:14.29]Perfect timing.
[00:14.71]F-099.
[00:15.37]Cool.
[00:19.15]Ooh, alright.
[00:19.79]How do I do it?
[00:39.14]Just queue up?
[00:46.60]Uh, your ranking is visible.
[00:48.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:50.75]That's fine.
[00:52.71]Okay, so.
[00:57.83]I've never played F-Zero.
[00:58.77]This is actually really fun.
[01:00.71]I'm really into this.
[01:01.29]Let's learn some basics before your first F-Zero 99.
[01:04.38]Race with players from around the world.
[01:08.08]Okay, steer, boost, accelerate, and then sliding.
[01:15.11]OK.
[01:16.13]Just focus on steering.
[01:25.49]That's how you get health, probably.
[01:35.20]Oh.
[01:42.36]Should I be drifting or something?
[01:55.34]Okay, boost.
[01:58.70]A while accelerating.
[02:00.84]Keep in mind, boost drains your power.
[02:02.28]If you run out of power, you'll be in danger of crashing out.
[02:04.60]Okay.
[02:14.52]Oh, I see.
[02:14.96]It's like an indicator up there.
[02:26.91]But don't use it again.
[02:37.29]Colliding with barriers and opponents drains power.
[02:39.59]But you can recharge power in the pit area.
[02:43.33]Avoid people.
[02:45.06]Whoa.
[02:49.96]Oops.
[02:51.00]Okay, well that wasn't good.
[02:59.32]Okay, slide to avoid players.
[03:05.74]Ah, it's a strafe.
[03:19.75]Super sparks drop by gold bumpers and from collisions between machines to fill your super meter.
[03:25.07]Okay.
[03:27.93]Press A when your super meter is charged to fly on the skyway.
[03:31.19]Okay, so I need a super boost.
[03:50.36]Ah, that's cool.
[03:51.42]So you essentially get your own track.
[03:56.18]Can you fall off of it?
[03:57.04]No.
[04:02.30]But you did it with 100 people?
[04:03.36]Let's go.
[04:09.86]You're ready.
[04:10.34]25 pilot race.
[04:15.14]Okay, let's do it.
[04:21.29]You got some practice to do?
[04:22.15]Choose my machine.
[04:25.71]Oh, I want durability.
[04:29.17]Wild goose?
[04:30.91]I'm doing wild goose.
[04:44.56]Okay, so are these real players or these bots?
[04:55.67]So what you're saying is I should absolutely come in first place.
[05:03.56]Let go of Accelerate to avoid slipping around.
[05:05.75]I was going to ask that.
[05:08.39]Spin attack.
[05:11.37]Oh, that's cool.
[05:12.51]Let's do it.
[05:16.77]Hmm.
[05:34.42]Now I get it.
[05:35.10]They don't have coins?
[05:46.29]Ow.
[05:47.79]How come they're not golden?
[06:05.99]The strafe is actually good to use on turns sometimes.
[06:09.55]I just killed that person.
[06:20.07]My whole face is itchy, but I can't do anything about it.
[06:43.59]No.
[06:45.17]Oh, I tried.
[06:45.95]Okay.
[06:46.98]Cool.
[07:02.04]Jump.
[07:13.76]OK, so I did it.
[07:16.90]Slow down in the pit.
[07:17.68]I could have slowed down.
[07:19.62]I just figured I want to keep up pace.
[07:25.46]I did it.
[07:28.70]Now it's time for the real players.
[07:33.38]50 pilot race.
[07:35.98]Not quite.
[07:44.52]Task failed successfully.
[07:45.82]We're good.
[07:51.66]What is grip?
[07:53.20]The road?
[07:53.60]Give me the fast one.
[07:56.54]Back speed, 462, 478.
[07:57.40]Big blue.
[07:57.78]Different track, I think.
[08:20.56]Starting now, you'll have to finish within the safe rank of each lap to continue.
[08:24.42]Oh, that's... I like that.
[08:27.72]This is cool.
[08:28.59]I get it now.
[08:29.85]Okay, try to finish in the top 35.
[08:30.79]Let's do it.
[08:47.14]Let's really screw this person's day up.
[09:01.57]Not bad.
[09:11.42]Is there a break?
[09:13.91]Or is it just gas?
[09:30.18]Get out of the way.
[09:31.58]Oh my goodness, get out of the way.
[09:32.74]You're just ruining everything.
[09:37.90]Get this shit out of the way.
[09:42.10]Okay, you have to be in 40th place.
[09:45.12]I'm in first place.
[09:46.10]I'm good.
[09:49.97]So this is a way to mess with the person in first place.
[09:56.71]I get it.
[10:04.14]I'm gonna start passing people, I think, very soon here.
[10:06.76]Cool.
[10:08.06]Alright, there you are.
[10:17.05]I don't even need the boost, just drive.
[10:24.90]This is bad.
[10:42.00]Okay, uh, so you can die.
[10:43.78]I was not aware that you could explode and be out.
[10:51.01]I thought it was gonna Lakitu me and just put me back on the track in, like, 15th place.
[10:56.37]Okay, good to know.
[11:19.52]Stay on the road.
[11:30.83]Good.
[11:31.21]Okay.
[11:34.14]So if I cross to the next lap, am I eliminating people that are in those bottom places?
[11:39.68]Is that how that works?
[11:41.54]Because if you're a real, if you try as hard as you can, you can just eliminate people.
[12:02.67]Crap.
[12:07.45]No.
[12:08.25]Alright, just drive.
[12:08.93]I'm way ahead of everybody.
[12:16.07]Don't.
[12:26.72]Somebody else just blew up.
[12:36.44]I should be pretty far ahead.
[12:37.92]Alright, there we go.
[12:39.36]People up.
[12:39.86]Alright, we're good.
[12:40.42]We're good.
[12:40.87]Fine, that's fine.
[12:44.53]There's a lot of red.
[12:45.63]I knew you were going to get hit by that.
[12:50.01]That was not fair.
[12:59.59]No!
[13:00.05]Stop!
[13:01.23]Oh my god!
[13:02.27]What the fuck?
[13:03.67]What the fuck?
[13:07.55]Dude, you can just get exploded!
[13:09.23]Okay, let's do it.
[13:11.27]Turn it up a little?
[13:15.94]Alright, I'll turn it up.
[13:17.96]This is so fun though.
[13:23.84]Is that too loud or is that good?
[13:45.56]Don't even try hard.
[13:46.74]Why am I trying really hard?
[13:48.52]Just wait till the last lap and then boost past everybody in the last two seconds.
[13:52.60]What, have I never played a racing game before?
[13:56.83]Just stay within 10 places.
[13:59.85]Top 10.
[14:00.45]You'll be fine.
[14:04.37]Just look, they're all going to drive into the red things.
[14:06.61]Always stay in 10th place.
[14:10.92]You can collect all this bullshit.
[14:30.58]Good.
[14:32.16]Okay.
[14:34.40]What am I in?
[14:36.18]10th place.
[14:36.44]Perfect.
[14:37.08]That's what you do.
[14:50.89]You just gotta do a little bit of an excuse me right there.
[14:52.85]I need help.
[14:57.32]I almost have a, um, super meter.
[15:05.50]Alright, I'll win this right here.
[15:15.28]Watch out for the explosion.
[15:16.28]Stay behind.
[15:17.54]Let him do it.
[15:18.56]Let him hit it.
[15:20.14]Good.
[15:23.92]Watch that turn.
[15:28.04]Now we punch it.
[15:33.88]Okay, I get it now.
[15:34.64]This is fun.
[15:35.76]I actually really like this a lot.
[15:41.52]This is time for the real deal.
[15:48.28]Your last trial will be a 99 pilot race.
[15:50.39]Final tutorial.
[16:07.01]I feel like I like this a little more.
[16:09.61]A little more durable.
[16:23.94]It's not Mario Kart timing.
[16:25.17]Wait until right before the race starts.
[16:28.01]Okay, I'll try it.
[16:33.80]Oh my goodness.
[16:34.40]I'm so sorry.
[16:34.92]This thing just almost fell down.
[16:40.96]What is this?
[16:42.86]You'll now be racing against rival pilots of similar skill ratings.
[16:48.72]Okay.
[16:49.38]If you finish with a higher rank than your rival, your skill rating will increase.
[16:52.92]Is it just a straightaway?
[17:10.62]I don't think there's boost in this one.
[17:14.68]Ah.
[17:15.12]Good jump.
[17:26.59]Is this a rival?
[17:33.53]It is.
[17:41.20]These are bots, you said, right?
[17:49.12]Let's go.
[17:59.21]I can't let my rival beat me.
[18:09.12]He's driving like shit and I'm still not ahead of him.
[18:43.92]Okay, here we go.
[18:44.74]10th place, that's what I want.
[19:07.01]5th place?
[19:09.23]Is that okay?
[19:16.74]Oh.
[19:18.51]Two rivals defeated.
[19:23.83]Cool.
[19:25.37]Points earned.
[19:29.25]Top three machine.
[19:31.19]You receive ticket points based on how well you do in each race.
[19:34.01]Collect enough ticket points and you can earn tickets.
[19:36.95]Which allow you to enter grand, pre, and mini pre-events.
[19:40.16]Cool.
[19:40.52]Now this is the real deal now.
[19:46.92]You're ready to race online.
[19:48.16]All right.
[19:54.48]You'll need three tickets to be in the Grand Prix.
[20:01.19]Special event.
[20:01.91]Pro track.
[20:02.43]Taking the most dip.
[20:03.11]No.
[20:03.33]All right, let's just do it for real.
[20:05.61]This is it, right?
[20:20.14]All right, let's go.
[20:22.36]I'm going to stay on Wild Goose.
[20:26.64]So what's considered a win?
[20:27.66]Is it like Hearthstone Battlegrounds top four, top three, top five, top ten?
[20:31.70]What's considered a win?
[20:32.48]Okay.
[20:42.35]Just don't die.
[20:43.17]Top 80?
[20:50.18]Just survive, to be honest.
[20:51.30]Oh, wow.
[20:51.90]It's that difficult.
[20:52.56]Okay.
[20:53.96]Oh, shit.
[20:54.25]I'm going against the Joker.
[21:08.68]All right, I'm going to try to get in 25th or above place.
[21:24.27]Okay, this is a mess, but I like it.
[21:26.87]Just get all the coins.
[21:31.69]I'm not doing super boost till the last second.
[21:58.93]How come nobody drives on the road?
[22:18.96]85?
[22:19.02]What place am I in?
[22:22.90]People have to be getting pretty low on health.
[22:29.45]Okay.
[22:45.68]How did I miss that?
[22:49.44]Alright, somebody just exploded.
[23:04.79]Are these oil slicks?
[23:11.05]Oh, I was avoiding those the whole time.
[23:12.53]I thought that was oil on the ground.
[23:14.21]Now, all right.
[23:16.58]Let me try that again.
[23:17.36]Now, knowing that that's not what that is.
[23:18.62]I thought it was oil.
[23:28.10]Just survive.
[23:32.45]Okay.
[23:35.27]Nice.
[23:36.71]Grand Prix starts in 12 minutes.
[23:43.52]I can do that.
[23:43.98]I got enough tickets, right?
[23:45.34]Ooh, 12 minutes.
[23:46.09]Okay, let me practice.
[23:47.19]I have to practice a few more times.
[23:55.96]Let me try...
[23:59.99]This one.
[24:00.57]We'll go with the blue fog.
[24:01.91]Blue fog.
[24:02.37]Each race is four or five minutes.
[24:04.47]Vote for a track.
[24:05.33]Big blue.
[24:05.57]Why not?
[24:06.13]These are the rivals.
[24:30.32]We're all C minus.
[24:31.78]It's okay.
[24:38.13]Good luck, everybody.
[24:38.79]Alright, I'm just going to drive and not even worry about anything else.
[24:56.12]I didn't get that.
[24:56.84]That was annoying.
[25:02.78]dead already.
[25:21.88]It's so ridiculous when there's this many people on here.
[25:40.44]Okay, better than last time.
[25:55.23]Okay.
[25:57.67]I don't want to die.
[26:07.39]Big opportunity here.
[26:37.13]Lots of people dying right now.
[26:38.33]Alright, better than last time. 43.
[27:12.97]I'm a C driver.
[27:15.63]Do I have time for another couple?
[27:26.45]So what's the strategy to actually get in first place?
[27:28.72]Is it just try to get out in front?
[27:30.24]I'm going to try that this time.
[27:32.58]I'm going to try getting out in front really, really quickly.
[27:35.48]Use all my boosts, just get to first place.
[27:44.40]Okay, let's do it again.
[27:49.48]Know when to use the highways?
[27:53.24]If you kill another, you get a full boost.
[28:02.30]Use the skyway on tight corners.
[28:10.69]It's all about knowing when to boost.
[28:14.74]It's fun regardless, though.
[28:16.88]Even if you're in 40th place.
[28:24.44]Top 50, that's the bet.
[28:25.74]I could do it again.
[28:45.24]to stay with the group.
[28:49.83]It's hard to stay with the group.
[29:15.80]Shit.
[29:24.64]Oh, I want that.
[29:25.30]It'll be useful if I can get it.
[29:41.43]Skip everybody.
[29:53.03]Alright, get it again.
[29:56.09]I freaked out for a second, but it's fine. ...
[30:35.45]Oh!
[30:35.91]I forgot, I forgot, I forgot, I forgot.
[30:37.77]I'm dead.
[30:39.23]Oh man, I completely didn't repay attention to the bar.
[30:47.37]I completely just... I got into complete tunnel vision.
[30:50.64]I was like just boost to try to get up to like 30.
[30:52.70]I would have had it too.
[30:59.38]What about this one?
[31:18.16]So, how long do you... When you boost for the final time, are you just susceptible to dying in one hit?
[31:27.28]When you take yourself down to zero?
[31:28.48]Okay.
[31:57.66]Maybe even just avoid that part, honestly.
[31:59.84]At the very beginning.
[32:01.20]Alright, don't overdo it.
[32:25.21]I'm dead already, dude.
[32:31.66]All right, so I got passed by everybody and I drove on the road.
[32:40.13]I drove like on the correct part of the road and they all blew by me.
[32:42.57]OK, maybe just boost over its don't even do turns.
[32:48.11]Yeah, that's what it is.
[32:49.15]Don't even you don't drive on the real road.
[32:58.35]Let me help.
[32:59.73]Okay, I'm just gonna trust their life.
[33:28.05]You're way too early.
[33:36.20]Fuck, sorry.
[33:46.37]I need this bad.
[33:47.21]Oh, how did it miss?
[33:51.99]Uhhh.
[34:12.11]When's the Grand Prix?
[34:15.56]Two minutes?
[34:16.08]Do I have time to wait?
[34:17.52]I'm just going to wait.
[34:18.42]I'm going to get destroyed on this one.
[34:34.83]Go and practice?
[34:37.51]I kind of want to do this, though.
[34:38.47]I want to see it.
[34:41.18]Select it right now.
[34:45.92]Let's go.
[34:52.89]I'm going back to Wild Goose.
[34:55.86]It's good for me.
[35:08.96]What is Port Town 2?
[35:09.84]Hey, I might get lucky because if these tracks are really, really hard, then people might just explode.
[35:16.20]All right, I'm going to just do old lady driving.
[35:20.41]I feel like it's going to be helpful.
[35:28.09]This is not Grand Prix.
[35:30.98]This had a countdown on it, didn't it?
[35:36.88]Oh, I thought this was the one.
[35:38.62]Should I leave?
[35:39.04]This is pro-racist.
[35:45.63]Oh, well, why did this one have a countdown?
[35:49.91]I can do it after.
[35:51.66]Ooh, it sounds cool.
[35:59.84]Sneak by that one.
[36:20.76]Whoa, whoa!
[36:54.47]Should I touch those?
[36:56.77]Oh, they're sucking us to them.
[36:58.19]I get it.
[36:59.01]I thought I was supposed to touch those.
[37:04.11]This shit's getting hard now.
[37:06.29]Alright, just don't die.
[37:12.46]I almost have one.
[37:13.20]Come on!
[37:15.32]Give me this!
[37:26.73]Oh, now I know why this is a pro track, because we still have to be on it.
[37:29.17]I should have drove like an old lady.
[37:30.13]Oh my god.
[37:34.18]I have no experience with these things.
[37:37.12]It's scary.
[37:53.92]Can they see my health?
[37:55.40]I hope not.
[38:01.51]This is a big deal if I can hit this.
[38:10.63]God damn it dude.
[38:20.62]Great.
[38:37.04]Top 50, I did it.
[38:52.96]So, do I get to stay in the race?
[38:54.66]I got a lot of tickets.
[38:59.29]Brand Free!
[39:02.31]Night League.
[39:04.49]Cool.
[39:07.40]Test your mettle in the Ultimate Five Race Series.
[39:09.92]Alright, I'm going to do this.
[39:12.76]And we are going to... This will be it.
[39:15.57]I'm going to call it after this.
[39:29.57]Stay on, Goose.
[39:35.25]The bet is for the first race.
[39:37.05]Will he reach top 50 in the next race?
[39:38.71]That's what you're betting on.
[39:39.43]Alright, let's do it.
[39:44.51]These are difficult.
[39:45.63]Oh, it's okay.
[39:46.21]If I lose, I lose.
[39:46.95]Sorry.
[39:47.17]Top 80 advance.
[39:49.19]That's all I'm... I'm gonna drive like an old... I don't care about winning.
[39:52.13]I just need to get to number 79.
[39:54.28]That's it.
[39:54.52]That's all I care about.
[39:58.30]Watch this.
[39:59.86]Watch all these... Watch all these weirdos.
[40:01.58]Watch this.
[40:01.92]They're just gonna all drive...
[40:03.85]Why would you do that?
[40:04.43]You need to get to 80th place.
[40:06.93]Oh, you guys bet.
[40:21.24]That's right.
[40:22.68]My bad.
[40:23.10]My bad.
[40:23.64]I'll try.
[40:24.26]I'll try.
[40:25.62]That's right.
[40:26.78]Sorry.
[40:30.55]Oh, that's funny.
[40:42.49]Okay Mm-hmm
[41:13.10]Hey, don't be stupid.
[41:19.31]I can get up to 50 in one second at the very end here.
[41:27.86]Oh, I have to get up now!
[41:42.68]I'm good.
[41:43.58]I made it.
[41:43.92]I made it.
[41:44.22]I made it.
[41:44.50]I'm fine.
[41:44.80]I'm fine.
[41:46.26]Oh my God.
[41:46.75]That was terrifying, but we're good.
[42:07.72]Oh, almost.
[42:09.20]I tried.
[42:09.52]I really did.
[42:14.67]Not bad, though.
[42:17.55]I ranked up.
[42:19.77]Okay, so now there are 80.
[42:35.80]Honestly, my strategy is just to stay in the very back.
[42:39.90]Whatever the maximum number is.
[42:42.76]Try to get to just very, very slowly.
[42:46.22]Try to get to top 20, top 40.
[42:47.98]I have nobody pay attention to me.
[43:03.95]So this is top 60 pass.
[43:08.30]I'll try to get to 50 at the very end.
[43:10.72]I don't want to get to 50.
[43:11.30]Obviously I'm going to try to get as high a place as I can.
[43:51.46]Okay, now we do now
[44:14.80]Alright, I'm going to hang out in this thing here.
[44:18.29]Good place to do it.
[44:49.46]Get the fuck out of my way.
[45:06.61]Come on, give me those coins.
[45:14.32]Yeah.
[45:19.89]31.
[45:24.73]I'm in the B's now.
[45:26.80]Top 50 now?
[45:27.60]Top 40?
[45:27.76]Good race.
[45:46.53]See, this is where it gets weird because I've gotten top 50 a few times, but top 40, top 20.
[45:52.84]This really might be actual grandma mode.
[45:59.18]For real this time.
[46:13.07]I'm going to try to conserve boost as much as I possibly can.
[46:23.12]Whoa, that was weird.
[46:26.09]Where are we going?
[46:27.55]Oh, we're crossing over each other.
[46:55.04]Okay.
[46:55.46]Easy.
[46:55.64]I'm gonna hold this for now.
[46:58.26]Do it now.
[47:07.41]I'll stay in 10th place.
[47:08.15]I don't care.
[47:17.22]I got a KO.
[47:26.02]You gotta drive better than this.
[47:34.42]Alright, here we go.
[47:53.97]I'm not doing anything stupid.
[48:12.25]I had to use it because I want to stay up here with everybody.
[48:13.97]All right, just drive.
[48:25.20]I'm still safe.
[48:30.78]Just got to get to top 40.
[48:49.00]Oh!
[48:55.72]Top 30.
[49:04.01]That was my nephew you KO'd.
[49:12.91]You threw so bad.
[49:14.22]No, I got full boost and just started spamming egg.
[49:20.12]Okay, top 30.
[49:25.28]Well... This is... Okay, cool.
[49:29.26]I'm doing alright.
[49:31.31]I got B pluses as my rivals now.
[49:37.75]This one has wind?
[49:38.79]Top 20 advance.
[49:53.72]You know what?
[49:55.56]That's fine.
[49:56.08]I don't gotta be in first place.
[50:04.35]I just have to get into 30th place.
[50:06.83]Oh.
[50:13.41]My camera's tilted.
[50:14.21]I don't like it.
[50:35.77]Okay, easy.
[50:41.69]I gotta stay up here.
[50:48.88]I gotta stay up in 30.
[50:52.92]Am I safe?
[51:01.09]All of you fucking clowns get out of the way!
[51:10.33]I don't know what's happening, but I hope I'm doing okay.
[51:12.89]Alright, just heal, heal, heal.
[51:18.81]I'm fine.
[51:24.39]I'm just gonna bump the fuck out of this thing.
[51:26.35]Yes!
[51:37.70]I need coins.
[51:41.37]Dude, I need coin!
[51:45.91]Give me that coin!
[51:49.25]Fuck!
[51:50.09]Oh, shit!
[52:03.84]I had it too.
[52:04.62]That was really fun.
[52:09.86]Oh, fuck.
[52:10.94]Oh, shit.
[52:14.64]It got bumped too many times.
[52:16.42]I would have made it too.
[52:20.92]Too bad.
[52:22.92]Let me do one more race.
[52:24.48]One more.
[52:24.78]I don't want to watch this.
[52:33.93]It's like Fall Guys.
[52:34.81]I don't want to watch the people jump on the cubes for like fucking 40 minutes.
[52:50.31]Do I have to sit here?
[52:52.17]This is the final, though.
[52:53.37]Oh, that's true.
[52:53.99]Let's spectate.
[52:58.17]Spectate later.
[52:59.15]Let's see how well you do.
[53:02.69]Seriously.
[53:03.63]What is the secret here?
[53:04.43]Show it to me.
[53:04.87]Okay.
[53:11.49]Hmm.
[53:12.79]Okay.
[53:17.15]Not bad.
[53:29.07]Oh, there's a shortcut.
[53:31.57]Is that a shortcut?
[53:34.28]I don't know.
[53:37.10]Who's number one?
[53:37.68]Alright, this is
[53:40.72]Bronze is in first place again.
[53:42.35]Still in first place.
[53:55.80]Alright, so you take a left.
[53:57.12]You get to hit that jump.
[54:00.10]Risky, but saves a lot of time.
[54:05.06]I want to see behind.
[54:08.11]Yeah, alright.
[54:11.55]Ooh, almost just hit the red.
[54:13.99]Good recovery.
[54:14.57]Good recovery.
[54:15.77]Uh-oh.
[54:23.76]Still top four.
[54:24.42]Use your attack more.
[54:32.80]Does the attack use boost?
[54:34.56]I've been afraid to use it.
[54:40.46]It does not.
[54:40.86]Okay.
[54:44.27]Just a cooldown.
[54:45.91]It's really actually awesome.
[54:47.47]Uh-oh.
[54:52.21]Can bronze pull it through?
[54:53.51]Not going for the risky play.
[54:54.79]Going for the continuous just stay in 4th place.
[55:00.13]Oh!
[55:01.61]And that's it.
[55:05.70]It's a good idea.
[55:07.42]Stay in 4th.
[55:11.91]Alright, let me do one more.
[55:13.13]Because I actually really do like this.
[55:14.83]GG, nice job.
[55:32.61]So they actually... Wow, it's only two hours.
[55:36.93]Those are special, cool.
[55:41.22]Special event team battle.
[55:42.40]Power your team to victory.
[55:45.30]I don't want to drag somebody down.
[55:46.58]Alright, one last bet for the night.
[56:00.98]Don't really care where we go, but why not?
[56:05.24]What did it say?
[56:05.96]Top 50?
[56:22.03]I think it's doable now.
[56:28.17]Oh, Bronze is right in front of us.
[56:35.07]I was going to stay right next to Bronze the whole entire game.
[56:38.68]I don't even know where he is.
[56:49.31]That was a pretty good weave.
[57:19.46]That just freaked me out and I'm the one that hurt him.
[57:31.81]He bounced off the wall and hit me and it freaked me out.
[57:51.00]I'm alright.
[57:54.58]It'll be way worse.
[58:46.83]That one doesn't count.
[59:08.98]I'm really, I'm like exclaiming really a lot today.
[59:16.75]I feel like I'm watching a boxing match.
[59:19.19]Like, whoa!
[59:20.65]Oh, he dodged it!
[59:21.87]Whoa!
[59:24.84]Popcorn's going everywhere.
[59:26.06]Alright, this is the real last one.
[59:33.94]I was almost in the 25, too.
[59:46.82]Final last one.
[59:51.55]You're at three to one odds.
[59:53.65]You got to take the dark side.
[59:57.97]You got to try to make that, uh, make those channel points.
[60:06.45]That's funny.
[60:07.01]I like that.
[60:07.57]Oh yeah.
[60:10.73]Let's check this out.
[60:13.65]I've been, I've been just
[60:17.28]I've been faking it the whole time.
[60:18.72]Watch this.
[60:21.41]I'm gonna get top 20.
[60:22.03]Gonna be a nail biter.
[60:48.29]I just grabbed the wall and ran my head into it over and over again.
[61:18.06]Give me this shit.
[61:18.54]Give me it.
[61:25.69]Give me it.
[61:35.42]I'm sorry.
[61:35.66]I'm in a good position right now.
[61:36.71]I actually am.
[61:49.55]That's how we, that's called.
[61:51.93]Good.
[62:28.80]See you later, suckers!
[62:34.27]So long, suckers!
[62:50.98]I did it, I got it.
[62:59.41]Alright.
[63:00.51]That unlocked one more.
[63:03.30]Actual final for real, the last one.
[63:05.32]I'm just happy.
[63:08.16]Maybe the team one.
[63:12.38]Alright, we'll do team battle and that'll be the last one.
[63:17.08]Race aggressively with your team and fight for victory.
[63:19.17]Highest team score wins.
[63:20.39]We need KOs.
[63:22.19]Alright.
[63:35.31]Go fast.
[63:36.23]I don't know which one I prefer.
[63:45.89]Probably this one.
[63:54.94]Okay, pink team versus green team.
[63:56.80]Earn points and lead pink to victory.
[63:58.66]Okay.
[64:18.25]Pink team takes the lead.
[64:31.21]Good amount of points so far.
[64:38.86]I'm losing.
[64:47.76]I'm surrounded by greens!
[65:13.87]Come on, tank.
[65:31.55]Alright, I'm gonna farm this.
[65:41.35]I'm not going to touch it once is what I meant to say.
[66:16.88]Oh, that was a good hit, good hit.
[66:18.12]We win?
[66:18.50]I think wins.
[66:26.68]Yes, we did it.
[66:43.64]Surely one more?
[66:44.50]Yeah, might as well just go out with one final one.
[66:55.33]Did I get a new thing?
[66:58.39]Wait, how do I... How do I do that?
[67:03.10]Nope, that's not what I wanted.
[67:06.40]okay well um I tried to go to workshop and it bounced around and let's go okay let's go it's just a mini grand prix we're okay
[67:35.10]You don't have to end the stream.
[67:36.38]No, we're cool.
[67:36.94]I'm cool.
[67:41.09]I planned on stopping around like 730, but no, we're good.
[67:44.53]I'm good.
[67:46.40]I'm just chilling.
[67:59.59]In the background right now, there's just like the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
[68:08.10]You guys are all just screaming at each other about buying and selling.
[68:17.91]I gotta get to at least this top.
[68:30.75]Back in the green.
[68:31.49]Full charge almost.
[68:35.13]Here we... Here we... Here we go.
[69:14.90]Easy.
[69:25.96]Perfect.
[69:26.54]Actually, perfect.
[69:29.22]Perfect.
[69:31.88]Perfect.
[69:32.55]Okay, go.
[69:47.27]I did it, top 25.
[69:50.63]Nice.
[69:57.23]Now I gotta go from top 25 to top 10.
[69:58.19]These are just done very quickly too.
[70:01.99]I like that a lot.
[70:21.60]So does that put me in a better place?
[70:23.20]I imagine it probably does.
[70:27.34]Is this top 60?
[70:28.75]That's it.
[70:33.29]Very addictive.
[70:34.03]It is.
[70:35.41]I love it though.
[70:35.85]This is great.
[70:36.33]Yeah.
[71:11.79]Somebody's dead.
[71:13.35]That always sucks.
[71:14.19]Okay, let's do it now.
[72:02.49]Final lap coming up.
[72:03.31]I just need my super boost for the final lap and I'm good.
[72:12.28]Okay, got it.
[72:16.64]Let's get some health.
[72:20.70]Oh, I have a lot of time.
[72:21.66]Let's just do it.
[72:48.27]See how it hits?
[73:26.07]Alright, this is the last one.
[73:33.62]I've never seen the end.
[73:40.69]Probably top 50 for the last one.
[73:57.25]24th overall.
[74:00.75]Is that accurate?
[74:04.27]This upcoming level sucks.
[74:05.39]Prepare yourself.
[74:10.53]Oh, this does look really, really hard.
[74:19.40]That... You're telling me I have to go through a fucking queue from Roller Coaster Tycoon?
[74:27.35]That could have been a much cleaner joke.
[74:33.87]You know what I was saying though.
[74:54.86]You gotta go over the jumps, it's really important.
[75:13.15]Not bad, actually.
[75:14.81]Could've been way worse.
[75:30.16]Oops, I didn't mean to do that, but it's okay.
[75:36.91]It's a really bad place to use this, but at least get across this part.
[76:05.03]Just me and you, Matt.
[76:07.16]Me and Matt hanging out in the very bottom.
[76:35.60]I'm dead.
[76:35.86]I'm dead.
[76:37.26]This is ridiculously hard.
[76:41.42]Okay.
[76:48.96]That was fun.
[76:57.22]That was fun.
[77:09.95]Machines.
[77:13.87]Fire Stingray.
[77:16.21]Decals boost.
[77:21.35]Level 5?
[77:22.01]What does that do?
[77:22.53]There's a different boost?
[77:29.99]Okay.
[77:31.93]We have to see what it looks like.
[77:43.51]Grandpa playing knock-off Mario Kart.
[77:56.10]I'm surprised how much I really like this.
[78:11.06]Where's my... Oh, that wasn't me.
[78:17.32]They're adding some more maps at the end of September.
[78:24.66]Just melt.
[78:25.66]Pac-Man 99 was like this too, though.
[78:29.23]I got really, really addicted to that for like a whole night.
[78:31.39]A couple nights.
[78:34.09]Played it.
[78:34.37]I think I did it off-stream too.
[78:44.82]That's what I did for, like, three days straight off stream.
[78:52.53]And I got so mad at one point that I went, motherfucker!
[78:57.68]And I put both my legs up and put both my heels down and went through the ground.
[79:02.70]At the same time.
[79:25.13]I would use it, but I'm not going to.
[79:26.65]Now I will.
[79:41.44]Perfect placement.
[80:02.88]That was pretty good.
[80:04.24]18, right?
[80:14.91]Okay.
[80:33.67]collect these so I can do it at the very end.
[80:44.47]This might be actually really great.
[81:05.11]Let me get top 15.
[81:05.71]Let me get top 15 right here.
[81:10.12]Yes!
[81:16.62]Everybody avoid me.
[81:19.41]Top 15.
[81:19.67]Let's go.
[81:21.71]Getting better.
[81:35.52]I'm psyching myself up big time tonight.
[81:37.24]Like somebody's behind me.
[81:44.02]That's the spirit.
[81:46.22]Yeah.
[81:46.84]Alright, well, okay, go until you lose.
[81:50.00]I think that's the good philosophy here.
[81:51.70]Because... I did... I just did 22.
[81:56.20]Now I just did 13.
[81:59.27]If I go... If I place under 13, then I'm gonna get out of here.
[82:01.97]I'm gonna get some dinner.
[82:04.53]It is dinner time.
[82:07.43]Let me take out one headphone because I'm like speech jamming myself too.
[82:10.72]Here we go.
[82:27.13]Are you listening to yourself?
[82:27.99]No, it's just sometimes when music and noises in both ears.
[82:33.27]If I can't hear myself talk, sometimes I gotta go.
[82:35.31]Where am I?
[82:35.77]I cannot hear anything.
[82:37.73]All right, I gotta get at least in the top 12.
[82:49.37]Mm-hmm.
[83:16.51]I'm getting a little too cocky here.
[83:45.78]Oh, I didn't get the kill for that.
[83:46.83]Alright, time to- I go drive like grandma until next round.
[83:54.96]That's good.
[83:58.58]Shit.
[84:16.37]Uh-oh.
[84:23.59]Well, this was a bad one.
[84:24.69]Speaking of the one to lose.
[84:39.70]Nobody touch me.
[84:42.54]Nobody touch me.
[84:43.04]Don't touch me.
[84:43.53]Nobody touch me.
[84:44.69]Alright, I finished it.
[84:53.75]All right, I'll see you guys later.
[84:56.39]Thanks for watching.
[84:56.97]Thanks for hanging out.
[84:58.55]Probably looking at the calendar.
[85:03.48]I'm going to be seeing some family.
[85:04.88]So I will not be around.
[85:07.32]I also have some work stuff to do.
[85:09.52]So the next time you see me will be probably at the... I want to say Tuesday of next week.
[85:18.06]Going to be visiting family, so...
[85:25.31]And then we'll probably end up doing a couple streams next week.
[85:32.63]Probably Tuesday and Sunday.
[85:34.21]I want to get a couple in next week.
[85:36.47]Because there's a couple things I really want to do.
[85:43.14]I want to play Armored Core.
[85:45.26]I really want to do... Yes, it is my birthday this week as well.
[85:51.26]And hey, visiting family for my birthday.
[85:53.16]So that should be nice.
[85:57.06]But yeah, I'll be back on Tuesday and then we'll do Armored Core probably.
[86:00.24]And we'll figure out what we're going to do on Sunday.
[86:04.90]Maybe browser games.
[86:06.78]Let's get back to the goofy browser games on Sunday of next week.
[86:13.30]It's been a while.
[86:17.71]My 38th birthday.
[86:18.59]Yes, it is.
[86:25.56]Getting there.
[86:27.14]Another few years.
[86:27.88]Another couple of years and I'm going to be... I don't know.
[86:32.80]It's going to be weird.
[86:35.96]Two more years till Judgment Day at 40.
[86:43.18]Did you queue again?
[86:44.12]No, the computer took over.
[86:45.64]You leave the controller on the table for a few minutes and the CPU takes over.
[86:52.21]Kind of like Left 4 Dead.
[86:56.53]I wonder how they do.
[87:09.58]Food mode fog.
[87:10.68]Yeah, I'll see you next week.
[87:31.03]Ending on 69 was not good enough for you, huh?
[87:36.34]It was.
[87:37.50]It was good enough, but I kind of had to do it differently.
[87:57.49]Okay, that's a good start.
[88:22.66]Count boost.
[88:23.36]Not right now.
[88:23.92]I'm in 30th.
[88:24.48]I'm fine.
[88:27.66]Okay, final lap.
[88:52.44]Drive.
[88:52.96]Good.
[88:53.24]Make it easy.
[88:54.80]I didn't get credit for that?
[88:56.36]I didn't get shit.
[88:57.98]Oops.
[88:58.60]Wrong button, but I'm okay.
[89:02.02]Oh, that's bad.
[89:03.10]Oh, that's very, very, very bad.
[89:05.46]I got... I just got destroyed.
[89:13.88]Lucky bumper.
[89:14.68]What am I doing?
[89:29.02]Oh, I get to be... I want to play one more.
[89:36.34]I want to play one more.
[89:42.95]And I'm going to because it's my birthday.
[89:47.31]And I'm also almost 40, so I get to dictate when I stop screaming and when I want to go to bed.
[89:51.81]And I'm not ready for bed yet.
[89:55.42]I want to keep playing.
[89:57.72]You understand?
[90:10.20]I'm going to go new strategy on this one and then this is actually the final one.
[90:16.18]For real, there's no joking around right now.
[90:22.35]Actually, I'm going to leave after this.
[90:24.33]This is a fun stream though.
[90:25.67]Finally beat Breath of the Wild.
[90:28.23]Did the punch out thing.
[90:29.19]Played this.
[90:29.77]Did GoldenEye.
[90:31.03]GoldenEye controls were awful.
[90:34.63]If I play that again, I definitely want to switch it up to the other ones.
[90:40.61]Let's go find a new facility again, though.
[90:43.29]If I just hit L and R inside of all that group, I kind of just mess everything up, don't I?
[90:57.55]Yeah.
[91:16.02]I'm fine sitting right in the middle for now.
[91:20.45]But let's go ahead and use this right now.
[91:35.39]Avoid all the bullshit.
[91:42.39]That's exactly what I want, is that thing.
[91:48.01]Okay, that's good, that's good.
[91:48.92]Alright, now I just want to get leveled up.
[92:05.89]Not leveled up, uh, boosted.
[92:06.85]Yeah, here we go.
[92:10.81]All right, last lap.
[92:17.33]I got a lot of boost.
[92:18.47]Don't waste it.
[92:31.73]Oh, I forgot that was the last lap.
[92:32.85]I got top 50.
[92:33.33]I don't know why I thought that was one more.
[92:47.79]Okay.
[92:48.33]All right.
[92:48.67]See you later.
[92:50.13]I said it out loud.
[92:50.95]Yeah, but it's different processing versus saying something.
[92:55.94]That one didn't even count.
[92:56.66]You're right.
[93:19.67]He's never going to end.
[93:20.65]I'm ending after this.
[93:22.49]What?
[93:33.34]You guys put me on this game and I can't get away from it.
[93:43.52]Did the other ones still exist, like the Mario one, the Pac-Man one, Tetris?
[93:48.61]Because I could seriously play these for an entire stream.
[93:52.59]Just all night.
[93:54.97]They don't exist anymore?
[93:56.09]Oh, that's sad.
[94:03.03]Okay.
[94:10.60]Better start.
[94:11.68]Don't talk.
[94:14.54]Alright, no talking this whole match and I'll get to top 20.
[94:18.10]Here we go.
[94:33.76]He just bumped me out of that.
[94:35.66]Oh my god, what a disaster.
[95:04.46]OK, here we go, final lap.
[95:24.08]Gonna have pretty much full boost.
[95:27.02]Probably get it again.
[95:33.60]I thought I killed somebody.
[95:50.25]Stop!
[95:50.90]25!
[95:50.94]Got it.
[95:51.56]Bye.
[95:51.82]Good night.
[95:57.99]Top 25, that's how you go out.
[96:00.59]You come in not 1st place, not 2nd place, not 3rd place, not even 10th place.
[96:05.19]You go so far down, where they don't give medals anymore.
[96:10.58]And they haven't in a very long time.
[96:12.52]Let's go.
[96:16.02]Okay.
[96:43.11]What if I do this one with a goofy voice or something?
[96:50.02]You guys would like that, right?
[96:53.78]Can I turn it on?
[96:59.78]Hello?
[97:03.34]I go XLR sometimes, it just doesn't work.
[97:20.83]Let's go.
[97:25.25]You act like you're not going to sit and play this off stream anyways.
[97:28.34]So you get it.
[97:29.84]You know exactly what's going to happen.
[97:31.30]What's going to happen is I'm going to take this in the bathroom and drop the biggest dump of my entire life while I beat everybody in this game.
[98:07.49]How many people in this lobby right now are sitting on the toilet?
[98:11.59]It's 99 people here.
[98:16.65]It's probably like 60 people.
[98:23.89]I gotta be aggressive now.
[99:05.81]I care way too much about that thing.
[99:07.53]Yeah.
[99:08.53]Well, I wanted to end it anyway.
[99:13.91]Did I just... Am I safe?
