[00:09.16]Now what?
[00:09.71]Build the mannequin?
[00:15.43]Build the mannequin.
[00:16.39]Alright, well the head, the octopus head definitely goes on the head.
[00:21.17]That's very painfully obvious.
[00:24.25]Okay.
[00:25.85]So what is the banana, is the banana my, like, dick?
[00:29.76]What's the banana for?
[00:30.60]Alright, the suit goes on here.
[00:35.86]Suit, obviously.
[00:36.68]Okay.
[00:37.60]So what's the banana?
[00:40.98]Get out of the way, chair.
[00:44.04]Get out of my... Get out of my way!
[00:45.92]My god.
[00:48.22]Here, take it.
[00:48.96]Oh.
[00:51.04]Okay, I was wrong.
[00:54.32]I did it.
[00:55.46]Mannequin complete.
[00:57.98]I am the victor of the game.
[01:01.71]Well, now what?
[01:02.09]Did I beat it?
[01:04.48]Did I beat Octopus Father?
[01:09.40]Oh my god.
[01:11.53]Why is my house on fire?
[01:15.21]What is going on?
[01:16.41]Did this guy burn my house down?
[01:18.11]Oh my god.
[01:21.35]What about my family?
[01:23.73]What about my kids and my wife?
[01:27.93]I am not concerned about climbing this ladder as much as my sleeping daughter that's burning in a fire right now.
[01:36.08]Yeah, see?
[01:36.54]I climbed your stupid ladder.
[01:39.26]Get over here.
[01:41.50]I did it.
[01:43.22]Now can I go save my family?
[01:44.44]That's in... Whoa.
[01:46.94]Gotta secure a grip of my face.
[01:49.19]I don't know.
[01:49.83]I got away.
[01:51.21]I'm good.
[01:51.89]I'm good like that.
[01:53.69]You will be dead from sushi.
[01:55.89]I said that completely wrong.
[01:57.05]That was embarrassing.
[01:58.89]Oh, damn.
[02:00.43]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:02.23]It's the mannequin.
[02:05.46]Isn't the house on fire still?
[02:11.08]I don't understand.
[02:12.29]What happened to the house burning?
[02:17.53]The house was legitimately just on fire and it's just not anymore.
[02:20.61]Okay, whatever.
[02:23.51]So now what?
[02:27.01]I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.
[02:29.45]I don't understand.
[02:31.59]I don't understand.
[02:33.17]I don't understand.
[02:35.80]Just gonna climb up this place.
[02:39.12]Something tells me this is not supposed to be happening right now.
[02:42.86]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.
[02:45.64]I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to be glitched into the wall.
[02:49.15]And, like, sliding up.
[02:51.23]I'm like...
[02:56.55]I'm like one of those chairs that climbs down the- I can't even make the joke, this is too weird!
[03:02.21]Get me- what's happening to me?
[03:04.99]Seriously, what the f- Get up the stairs!
[03:12.08]I- I'm gonna have to restart the game!
[03:14.68]Where's my left leg?
[03:25.83]Oh, whoa!
[03:26.89]Oh, hold on, so you could actually slip on the banana peels?
[03:32.69]Oh, whoopsie daisy!
[03:34.49]Oh, let's take a joke from, like, an 80s cartoon.
[03:39.57]Whoa, look out, is that a banana peel right there?
[03:42.44]Whoa!
[03:44.40]What the hell do I even do now?
[03:47.10]What, did I beat the game?
[03:48.42]It didn't say, like, I beat the game.
[03:49.88]It was like, oh, hooray, you saved us from burning.
[03:52.62]Bye.
[03:55.07]Can I play pool?
[03:57.63]Oh my god, I think I can actually play pool.
[04:00.43]Oh, hell yeah.
[04:01.45]Let's go.
[04:02.69]Let's play this pool game.
[04:05.91]Come on, you... No!
[04:11.02]No, I'm gonna get a scratch.
[04:13.96]I just scratched.
[04:17.88]I'm really good at pool.
[04:18.74]Yeah.
[04:18.84]I didn't want to do that.
[04:20.56]I wanted to throw it.
[04:21.48]That's why I said yeah.
[04:23.70]Yeah.
[04:23.98]Yeah.
[04:25.45]Are you kidding me right now?
[04:27.35]I'm knocking these things over.
[04:29.04]This is how we play pool.
[04:32.76]As a real man.
[04:33.92]I'm like stomping grapes.
[04:37.80]Anyone want some pool wine?
[04:40.46]Wait a second.
[04:42.25]Wait just one second.
[04:46.37]This is a shovel.
[04:47.49]Why would there just be a shovel right here?
[04:51.21]Hold on.
[04:52.65]Am I about to dig up this dead body that's down here?
[04:55.53]It works!
[04:56.03]It works!
[04:56.31]It works!
[04:56.53]It works!
[04:56.89]Hold on.
[04:59.23]Oh my god, this guy's dead corpse is gonna be down here, I think.
[05:02.53]The real father.
[05:04.35]Oh, that would be so crazy.
[05:05.53]There's bananas.
[05:11.09]Is this Octodad or Octodog?
[05:14.25]Because who buries this many things?
[05:16.85]Like, what the hell?
[05:18.11]Half octopus, half dog.
[05:20.82]Oh, I want to bury my toys.
[05:24.35]Wait a second.
[05:26.13]Get that out of here.
[05:26.65]Get the fuck out of here.
[05:27.41]That's a key.
[05:29.65]That's a key!
[05:31.61]Give me that!
[05:32.27]What?
[05:33.19]Is this like a giant, like, prop key?
[05:34.77]Or is that like a real key?
[05:38.94]Pick it up!
[05:39.80]Pick the fucking key up!
[05:42.60]Yes!
[05:45.28]You found a key.
[05:46.46]The key can be used to open doors of various lengths.
[05:50.53]Okay, I've gotta say this right now.
[05:52.53]I've been walking around aimlessly with this key in my fucking hand for like 30 minutes.
[05:58.82]And you're telling me I'm looking at a keyhole right over there.
[06:02.68]You see that?
[06:04.02]You guys see this right here?
[06:07.52]This is gonna open this door.
[06:10.69]Please, come on.
[06:11.41]Please tell me I was right.
[06:12.39]Please tell me I was- What is this?
[06:17.37]What is this?
[06:18.57]Open!
[06:20.31]Open with your legs!
[06:24.55]Does that not do anything?
[06:25.51]Come on!
[06:29.49]Open!
[06:31.49]Open!
[06:34.95]Yes!
[06:35.27]What the- Where the hell am I?
[06:41.65]I'm in like an underground facility!
[06:44.91]What is this?
[06:47.49]And why is the chef back?
[06:51.58]I am so confused right now.
[06:53.66]It's not even funny.
[06:57.59]I saw a panel over here.
[06:58.61]Can I open the panel?
[07:01.05]I have to be able to open this panel.
[07:03.45]It's the only thing I can do.
[07:11.69]That was very easy.
[07:12.81]Okay.
[07:15.09]So what?
[07:15.37]Is this my secret superhuman lair?
[07:20.68]Well, I see big red button.
[07:22.02]That usually means press.
[07:24.92]Press the big red button.
[07:27.36]Okay.
[07:28.92]No, I... Yes, to the moon!
[07:32.22]We are going to the stars!
[07:35.22]Look at that stupid... Okay, I gotta beat this.
[07:37.60]Push it open.
[07:39.26]Push it.
[07:40.66]Push the button open!
[07:42.84]Push the button!
[07:44.21]Go!
[07:44.79]Go!
[07:45.55]Come on!
[07:48.53]It's a race!
[07:50.01]I made it.
[07:52.10]Okay... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[07:53.48]Don't get electrocuted!
[07:55.54]What is going on?
[07:56.30]What the... What... I... I'm... Alright, I can beat this.
[07:58.98]I can do this.
[08:00.06]I can do this.
[08:02.48]Go!
[08:03.29]No!
[08:05.33]Go!
[08:06.23]Come on!
[08:07.13]Come on!
[08:08.43]Turn off!
[08:10.03]These don't turn off.
[08:12.05]I have to step over these?
[08:13.65]Are you serious?
[08:16.13]Nice and easy.
[08:17.93]Nice and easy.
[08:22.28]Nice and easy!
[08:26.44]Look at my bar on the top left.
[08:28.30]Holy shit, this is gonna be so difficult to do this.
[08:31.50]I gotta get really close.
[08:39.57]Fuck!
[08:43.35]I just thought of a brilliant idea, let's see if it works.
[08:55.17]It worked, but I'm so tired.
[08:57.05]Oh, I'm dead.
[08:58.73]You got me with your lasers.
[09:01.35]Oh, I'm doing that on purpose.
[09:05.69]Alright, so guys, remember, if you're looking for a technique to beat that really difficult part, just, like, screw through it.
[09:11.28]Who cares?
[09:13.70]Um, oh, there's a zipline.
[09:15.80]Oh, this is gonna be so dumb.
[09:18.76]Are you guys ready for how dumb this is really gonna be?
[09:22.32]Here we go.
[09:22.88]Yay!
[09:24.12]Yay, that was fun!
[09:32.18]Oh god, I would play a game where you just did that.
[09:36.11]That was like the funnest part of this whole game.
[09:37.85]Oh, what?
[09:41.21]Another laser room?
[09:42.41]Oh, another laser room of, you know...
[09:48.88]in the whole room.
[09:49.74]Go!
[09:50.38]Go!
[09:52.82]Yes!
[09:53.96]Yes!
[09:56.75]I am the laser room master.
[10:01.21]Can I pick up one of these rocks?
[10:02.65]No, those aren't rocks.
[10:03.47]Those are like whistles.
[10:05.17]Give me one of the whistles.
[10:07.05]I've got to coach my little league team.
[10:11.93]I've got to be pretty close to being at the end here.
[10:14.35]Okay, there we are.
[10:18.42]Elevator?
[10:19.08]Whoa, whoa, why, whoa!
[10:20.18]Hey!
[10:20.64]Whoa, dude!
[10:21.48]What the f- What the fuck is going on?!
[10:25.36]I- What the- Goddammit.
[10:33.49]Well, the technique always works.
[10:50.90]Fucking god damn it!
[10:52.12]I don't wanna... I had this beat, dude.
[10:57.29]I had this beat and the game, like, fucked up.
[11:00.51]Great.
[11:11.63]Why did it work the first time and I can't get it to work again?
[11:14.73]You gotta be kidding me.
[11:17.48]Alright, there's that.
[11:18.92]Do I actually have to, like, do it the right way?
[11:20.98]How do I crouch?
[11:26.68]Crouch, huh?
[11:27.42]There's no way I can crouch.
[11:30.34]Oh my god, just go through it, you stupid prick.
[11:38.65]God!
[11:39.57]Alright.
[11:41.93]Can I not, like, glitch into the wall this time?
[11:43.83]It took me long enough to get back here again.
[11:46.68]Thank you.
[11:47.95]My god.
[11:50.11]There's a present.
[11:52.85]Alright, what do I touch?
[11:54.63]How about the present?
[11:55.83]Present looks promising.
[11:59.65]If I could put... Pick it... Why am I backwards?
[12:08.20]Why can I not pick up the present?
[12:11.32]Oh.
[12:12.20]I get it.
[12:12.82]Okay.
[12:14.56]The...
[12:16.90]I did it.
[12:17.22]Alright, so that's beating Octodad.
[12:21.42]Oh, I beat Octodad.
[12:23.32]Thanks for playing.
[12:24.54]Alright, what about the roses?
[12:25.46]I can do anything with the roses?
[12:27.59]Kind of.
[12:27.89]Alright, well.
[12:30.77]Thank you guys for watching this Octodad playthrough.
[12:34.79]Beginning to end, sort of, with edits in between.
[12:39.18]Here's a flower for you, because I love you.
[12:41.86]Let me bring it to you.
[12:44.36]Everybody watching right now, here's a flower for you.
