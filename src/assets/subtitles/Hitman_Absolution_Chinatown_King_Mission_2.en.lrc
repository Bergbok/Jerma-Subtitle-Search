[00:08.27]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:09.89]Jerma here, with some more Hitman Absolu- Whoa!
[00:13.32]Hitman Absolution.
[00:15.40]And this is episode 2, this is the King of Chinatown.
[00:18.44]And what are you cooking here, dude?
[00:20.28]There's nothing in this pot!
[00:22.54]You're not cooking anything!
[00:23.64]You know what?
[00:24.92]I just like, hammer punched him in the face.
[00:31.23]Alright, I gotta restart.
[00:33.69]Alright.
[00:35.31]Time to, uh, to actually play the mission.
[00:38.63]Get the hell out of my way.
[00:40.51]Get out of my face.
[00:41.49]This place is so crowded.
[00:43.73]How am I supposed to ever assassinate somebody here?
[00:45.91]This is going to be, like, impossible.
[00:48.07]Where is the guy?
[00:49.29]Oh, he's over there.
[00:50.73]You know, let's kill a guy that's, like, standing in the middle of the area.
[00:56.19]King of Chinatown.
[00:57.07]Here he is.
[00:58.23]Get out of the way.
[01:01.35]Get out of my face.
[01:02.65]These people are just blocking my path.
[01:07.71]Uh... Hello there, officer.
[01:11.43]Can I, like, come look at that guy?
[01:13.17]Nope.
[01:14.79]What?
[01:15.03]I was just kidding.
[01:15.91]Spotted.
[01:16.37]It was just a joke.
[01:18.57]Cool down, man.
[01:19.47]Wow.
[01:21.16]What is that?
[01:22.76]Oh, at least some points of interest.
[01:28.12]I see.
[01:28.84]There's a lot of different ways to potentially do this, probably.
[01:33.19]I can't believe I just lost 1500 points just for going up there and, like, smiling.
[01:38.64]Should I get a tattoo?
[01:39.38]There's a lot of people over here.
[01:42.64]This person.
[01:43.06]What's this person selling?
[01:43.88]You got fish?
[01:45.62]Watch out.
[01:45.94]Let me, like, look at it.
[01:48.16]Aw, that looks good.
[01:49.24]Fresh fish.
[01:50.90]Now get the hell away from me.
[01:56.34]Where should I even go?
[01:57.16]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:59.94]There's, like, a... Well, that's that guy's trail.
[02:02.00]Okay.
[02:04.64]Can I walk by this guy?
[02:05.54]Is he gonna freak out?
[02:08.00]I don't think I can walk by this guy.
[02:09.76]What's this?
[02:10.72]Sabotage?
[02:12.16]Hell yeah, sabotage.
[02:19.25]I can't believe that guy didn't see me.
[02:21.41]How did this guy not see me just do that?
[02:23.19]Dude, you're an idiot.
[02:23.91]Did you say nice shirt?
[02:26.53]What a prick.
[02:28.67]Look at the nice shirt to you.
[02:29.60]What is it, like 1984? 1984?
[02:32.83]This isn't like the 80s, bro.
[02:35.53]Sneaking behind that guy.
[02:39.21]Trespassing, but he can't see me.
[02:40.56]He doesn't even know.
[02:41.32]Yes!
[02:41.76]Okay, get that bottle.
[02:43.08]What the hell do I do?
[02:45.20]Are the lights off up here?
[02:47.00]Is anybody else up here?
[02:48.00]I swear to God, I'm gonna get myself murdered.
[02:50.88]No, there's nobody here.
[02:51.64]Huh?
[02:55.51]Keep out.
[02:57.25]An apartment overlooking the square.
[02:59.07]Fits Birdie's description.
[03:00.39]Okay.
[03:00.71]A lot of places to hide.
[03:02.96]I'm kind of afraid of this area.
[03:08.88]I guess I can go... Can I even open this door?
[03:11.76]Ooh.
[03:14.40]Oh, this is the guy's apartment.
[03:16.72]It's a...
[03:23.85]I'm going to snipe the hell out of this guy.
[03:26.31]Where is he?
[03:28.83]Can I even go in this window?
[03:31.47]I'm scared to go in it.
[03:32.45]There he is.
[03:34.03]Hold on.
[03:34.35]I need an escape route here, guys.
[03:36.13]Because if I shoot this guy... I don't want to get in the window.
[03:40.41]Someone's going to see me in this window.
[03:44.27]It's going to be over.
[03:46.86]There's the guy right there.
[03:47.76]Can I shoot him from right here?
[03:49.36]No, I've got to be standing.
[03:52.90]Oh, man.
[03:55.90]I don't want to take the shot.
[03:57.24]Oh, I can't pull the trigger.
[03:58.24]I can't do it.
[03:59.98]Oh, I can't do it.
[04:01.14]I can't do it.
[04:02.61]Oh, I gotta do it.
[04:03.31]I gotta do it, like, right now.
[04:07.99]Oh!
[04:09.29]Oh!
[04:10.35]Oh!
[04:11.41]I got him.
[04:13.43]Didn't anybody see that?
[04:15.03]There's a guy coming.
[04:15.51]There's a guy coming.
[04:16.17]There's a guy coming.
[04:16.96]He didn't see me.
[04:20.16]Oh, my God.
[04:20.70]There's a guy at the top of the stairs right there.
[04:27.18]Look in the radar, look in the radar.
[04:28.42]There's two people that are coming up here right now.
[04:32.00]I am actually, like, shaking.
[04:33.79]I'm like, oh my god.
[04:35.03]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, there he is.
[04:36.55]Oh my god, oh my god.
[04:37.45]Please don't open this.
[04:41.05]Please don't open this.
[04:51.18]Should I get out?
[04:54.04]God!
[04:54.48]This is the most terrifying thing ever!
[04:59.60]He's looking at me!
[05:01.88]Oh, get out of here!
[05:03.02]Get out of here!
[05:04.52]I'm freaking out right now, guys.
[05:12.42]That was... That was so terrifying.
[05:16.59]Am I in the clear?
[05:19.27]Cautious.
[05:19.71]Okay, I need to get out of this closet.
[05:22.41]When this guy comes back in here, I'm killing him.
[05:24.89]I'm jumping out.
[05:30.25]Push him out the damn window.
[05:33.39]Choke him out.
[05:35.43]Choke him out.
[05:36.09]Oh, that's the guy that talked a bunch of crap.
[05:38.49]I'm breaking his neck.
[05:39.31]Remember this guy?
[05:41.03]This is the guy that said, like, oh, what are you, like, what are you, nice shirt.
[05:45.12]Yeah, disguise.
[05:48.29]Can I, like, bury this guy somewhere?
[05:51.83]There's literally... There's two dudes right here!
[05:54.95]Come on, get in here!
[05:55.73]Get in here!
[05:57.11]This guy looks like an idiot.
[05:59.61]Oh, that's pretty morbid.
[06:01.47]Hey, I had to break this guy's neck.
[06:03.41]He was an absolute prick.
[06:06.74]Don't mind me, just carrying around a... How do I... I gotta... Throw that down.
[06:11.28]Alright, now I'm this guy.
[06:12.40]I'm gonna walk out as this guy.
[06:14.94]Alright, shut up.
[06:15.64]It's just, uh... It's just me...
[06:19.55]Oh, hi.
[06:20.03]Yeah, remember me?
[06:20.67]I just need backup.
[06:22.05]I need backup.
[06:23.09]Oh, my God.
[06:24.59]I'm actually going to get away with this, I think.
[06:28.47]Anybody else?
[06:29.90]They're looking for me out here.
[06:33.12]Hello, officers.
[06:34.50]Good to see you.
[06:35.44]Nice to meet you.
[06:37.86]Wow, everyone's freaking out.
[06:41.24]I should get a pretty good score for this, shouldn't I?
[06:42.99]Oh, I did break that guy's neck.
[06:45.85]How do I get out of here?
[06:46.93]Oh, it's over here.
[06:48.99]I want to just, like, sprint.
[06:50.33]That was terrifying, guys.
[06:52.23]That was ridiculous.
[06:54.85]When those guys were, like, looking for me, and they almost spotted me.
[06:59.03]Oh, I'm home free.
[06:59.67]This is, like, an exit, I think.
[07:03.71]Yes!
[07:05.01]I did it!
[07:05.33]Oh, nice.
[07:07.73]And there it is.
[07:16.96]36,000 points.
[07:18.00]Target kill, 1.
[07:18.98]Non-target casualty, 1.
[07:21.32]Minus 3.
[07:21.58]Ah, that's the guy.
[07:22.68]But that guy was a jerk, so he deserved it.
[07:25.46]3 objectives complete or times 3.
[07:27.84]Body hidden and headshot.
[07:30.10]Hell yeah.
[07:30.80]Nice.
[07:32.32]But that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[07:34.28]If you missed episode 1, again, it'll be in the description and probably an annotation on the screen in the beginning and end of this video.
[07:40.24]So yeah, thank you so much for watching.
[07:41.52]Really do appreciate it.
[07:42.14]I'll see you all soon.
[07:43.38]Take care, everybody.
[07:44.57]Stay tuned for episode 3!
