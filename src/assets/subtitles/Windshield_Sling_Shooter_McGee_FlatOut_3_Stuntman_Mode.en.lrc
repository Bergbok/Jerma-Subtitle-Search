[00:09.90]Some of these characters are so stupid.
[00:11.66]Oh, I'm definitely being this guy.
[00:17.45]Oh my god, it's Zario.
[00:19.41]Hmm, I wonder why this guy's name is Zario.
[00:25.33]Might have something to do with it.
[00:26.13]He looks like... He even does a Super Mario jump!
[00:28.59]Did you see that shit?
[00:31.06]You just did the Super Mario jump!
[00:33.76]I'm not sure if you're talking to me or talking to everyone else.
[00:35.90]Watch out for the copyright infringed copyright strike.
[00:39.91]The evil windmill.
[00:42.39]Are you ready?
[00:43.69]I'm gonna destroy you.
[00:44.35]Is it my turn first?
[00:45.39]Who goes first, me?
[00:47.51]We're both here.
[00:48.51]Oh, well, I'm going.
[00:50.95]What?! !
[00:55.81]You didn't make it up the hill.
[00:56.73]Okay, my turn.
[00:58.01]You used your turn.
[01:00.83]Wait, it says press the... What?
[01:19.39]What is the goal of this?
[01:22.94]I don't know.
[01:23.76]Get hit by the windmill a million times, probably.
[01:31.89]Got it.
[01:34.65]I can't believe it.
[01:39.25]I can't believe that actually happened.
[01:41.77]It's a me, Mario.
[01:44.28]It's a me, Zario.
[01:47.78]Industrial realism.
[01:49.54]Highway.
[01:52.04]Study each map for the goal.
[01:53.82]Police done with this car.
[01:54.68]It's just coming forward at all times.
[01:57.30]Please.
[01:58.93]Please.
[01:59.27]No.
[02:00.63]No.
[02:01.47]Damn it, why is it called Highway then?
[02:02.99]Because we have to... jump onto this frickin' highway.
[02:08.75]What?
[02:11.48]What?
[02:12.74]Yeah, again, you're supposed to eject before you hit it, I guess.
[02:15.64]That's what I did.
[02:16.36]No, I didn't.
[02:19.98]It's a bee!
[02:23.46]What do you mean, find the goal?
[02:24.78]We're just ejecting out of the cars.
[02:27.71]What is this?
[02:28.33]I have no idea.
[02:32.13]I'm kinda... Alright, let's wait.
[02:33.53]Study the map.
[02:34.15]Study... You just... We were supposed to study the map!
[02:42.92]I tried to study it!
[02:44.10]Don't you know?
[02:46.54]Study the map and get the most out of your experience!
[02:51.71]Well, I'm gonna try and make this jump right now.
[02:53.99]Alright, me too.
[03:06.72]Why does this have a 23 on Metacritic?
[03:08.66]This is the best game I've ever played!
[03:12.08]Hit him high.
[03:14.94]Ugh, I have a fucking headache, dude.
[03:16.31]When we were tapping Triangle, you know what cartridge tilting is?
[03:22.27]Yeah.
[03:23.15]That's what was happening.
[03:23.99]My character was like stretching and it was fucking horrific.
[03:27.61]Look at them balls.
[03:28.86]Oh man, this is gonna be sick.
[03:31.74]What do you even do?
[03:32.52]Let's just go at the same time.
[03:33.91]Speed up.
[03:34.47]Don't, don't, don't.
[03:35.95]We have to study and survey the area.
[03:38.06]Didn't you read?
[03:46.98]What happened to all of my momentum?
[03:48.86]It just went straight up.
[03:56.46]Dude, your car.
[03:59.20]You should have seen your car.
[04:06.58]You should have seen what your car did.
[04:10.12]Your car.
[04:15.78]I'll make sure I get over this one.
[04:18.22]Yeah, well, this time I'm going to get four million points.
[04:20.98]Yeah.
[04:22.06]Come at me, bro.
[04:23.39]I'm coming at the hill.
[04:28.13]Get up there.
[04:30.63]Oh, baby.
[04:30.95]Oh, baby.
[04:32.07]Oh, baby.
[04:33.65]Oh, baby.
[04:35.41]What?
[04:35.88]All right, this will be the last one.
[04:40.54]I feel like we've gotten the fly out of car thing out of our system, sort of.
[04:46.76]Yeah.
[04:47.22]Okay, four.
[04:47.80]Score 1,000 points.
[04:49.52]1,000 points.
[04:51.00]Four.
[04:51.16]Four.
[04:51.36]Four.
[04:51.88]Four.
[04:52.08]Four.
