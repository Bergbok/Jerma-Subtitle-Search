[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.76]Good afternoon.
[00:03.04]Welcome back.
[00:05.16]To another edition.
[00:08.47]Of me!
[00:10.67]Hi guys.
[00:13.49]It's been 14 minutes since Jerma said 10 minutes.
[00:17.49]That's not a big deal.
[00:20.90]An extra 4 minutes.
[00:24.90]Sometimes I say 10 minutes and it's 40.
[00:26.20]So...
[00:29.37]I'll take the four this time.
[00:35.31]Long minutes.
[00:36.51]Yeah, you gotta count them slower.
[00:39.76]That's four minutes of my life I'll never get back.
[00:43.22]I'm sorry.
[00:44.64]Anyways, hi.
[00:46.68]We are going to do... Just pick up right where we left off yesterday.
[00:49.78]In Disassembly VR.
[00:52.03]Disassembly VR.
[00:55.68]If you're just joining us, and you weren't here yesterday, this game's a treat.
[01:01.57]I like it.
[01:02.29]I'm having a great time.
[01:07.83]You take things apart, and that's it.
[01:11.25]That's the whole game.
[01:12.81]But it's fun.
[01:14.11]I don't know why.
[01:14.73]It just, like, it just squeezes my brain.
[01:20.26]It's very relaxing, it's very fun.
[01:23.38]And today, I've got news for you guys for the first time ever!
[01:29.06]Ever!
[01:32.34]That's right.
[01:33.58]For the first time ever, I am going to be sitting down in VR because standing up takes too much energy and moving around the room scale takes a lot out of me and so I could probably stream for more than four hours today.
[01:48.15]The chair!
[01:51.52]There it is.
[01:52.14]I've never done this before.
[01:57.26]How does it feel, first impressions?
[02:00.20]The seat's a little springy.
[02:03.70]I like the color.
[02:06.76]For all you office friends, how's the spin?
[02:20.75]I definitely should not have just done that before going into VR.
[02:22.70]We're gonna take a minute here.
[02:34.72]Just sit here.
[02:38.30]Spin.
[02:40.06]Well oiled, I'd say.
[02:41.40]It's pretty well oiled.
[02:44.08]Okay.
[02:44.95]I think I'm good.
[02:51.45]Try spinning, that's a neat trick.
[02:53.07]Take apart this chair, no.
[02:54.53]You're gonna be sitting there the whole stream and you have workout clothes on.
[03:02.88]I'm gonna get up.
[03:04.76]This is just, look, this is my, when I'm sitting at the desk and I got the screwdriver, I don't even go in like this.
[03:14.62]Where's that screw?
[03:16.46]Okay, where is it?
[03:17.20]Like a fucking T-Rex, like.
[03:20.51]Now, don't do that again.
[03:27.58]I'm not doing Raptor Part 2.
[03:31.14]God damn it.
[03:32.24]It's because I'm too far away.
[03:33.54]I can't, like, see what I'm doing.
[03:36.00]You know, like, sometimes when I'm this close, I can see what I'm doing over here.
[03:40.60]I can't see what I'm doing over here.
[03:41.92]Sometimes I'm just going to do random dumb shit like that, apparently.
[03:44.35]About where my...
[03:49.08]I'm doing Raptor Part 2.
[03:50.64]Spin in VR.
[03:52.00]Are you trying to kill me?
[03:56.08]You're trying to kill me.
[03:59.93]I'm not doing that.
[04:01.67]The cord's gonna get all tangled up.
[04:04.89]But let me get the audio on.
[04:09.43]I can't fucking believe I just did, like, a dinosaur again.
[04:14.41]And I didn't have the mask on this time, so...
[04:17.30]It's alright.
[04:18.31]Sometimes you make mistakes.
[04:19.97]I just happen to make them in front of a thousand fucking people.
[04:22.11]Alright.
[04:25.23]Disassembly.
[04:25.91]Are we good in the frame here?
[04:28.13]I think so.
[04:30.27]Yeah, this looks fine.
[04:30.85]You guys can hear it?
[04:35.41]I've never done this before.
[04:36.65]How am I gonna do this?
[04:38.89]Around the back?
[04:39.62]I don't know if this is a good idea.
[04:48.37]We'll find out, right?
[05:02.53]Hey, look at that!
[05:03.41]Ah, this already feels way better.
[05:04.63]Alright, there you guys are.
[05:10.52]I can see you.
[05:11.04]What do you say?
[05:12.62]What the fuck?
[05:16.82]Scoot in a little.
[05:19.71]Is that bad?
[05:20.25]Did I even scoot in?
[05:21.65]There we go.
[05:27.93]Webcam on the floor and sit on the floor.
[05:30.42]I'm not gonna do that.
[05:32.08]This is not the way it should be.
[05:33.16]It should be like this.
[05:38.14]I don't like that.
[05:38.74]It feels like I have a big piece of hair.
[05:51.90]Alright.
[05:53.02]When we last left off, this like fucking feels weird.
[05:55.98]I feel like I shouldn't be sitting.
[05:59.74]Fuck it.
[06:00.07]Alright.
[06:02.45]How it's made theme or right.
[06:03.93]We did that last night.
[06:04.91]Alright, where did we leave off?
[06:06.29]We left off here.
[06:09.71]At the missile.
[06:11.19]Do I, we already did, do I have to do the missile?
[06:19.11]If I gotta take apart this whole missile, it's like 5,000 parts.
[06:23.62]Okay.
[06:25.06]Alright, alright, I'm gonna do it.
[06:35.82]I feel like I have to do... I have to turn, right?
[06:39.15]That's the only way this is gonna work for me in my brain.
[06:42.13]I have to, like... Alright, this is fine.
[06:50.31]So we got, if you don't know how this works, lower the seat.
[06:56.08]Why, is the seat too high?
[06:57.12]Why is the seat too high?
[06:58.12]Hold on, let me get that for you guys.
[07:01.98]Do I got it?
[07:08.32]Is this it?
[07:16.48]I don't know which one it is.
[07:17.80]I'm afraid to press a button.
[07:26.58]Oh, I just like flip the switch.
[07:29.50]It's the eject button.
[07:31.08]Wait, it's this one here, I think.
[07:37.31]Better?
[07:37.57]Is it fine?
[07:47.20]Alright.
[07:47.66]Alright, here we go.
[07:51.36]I'll see you guys later.
[07:54.45]So this is how you work with this game.
[07:55.91]This game is a game about disassembling things.
[08:00.18]And not, you don't, you guys are over here, right?
[08:02.56]And not putting them back together.
[08:04.64]I kind of like this.
[08:05.48]This is better.
[08:07.06]Screwdriver.
[08:07.62]How many parts are there?
[08:10.53]A hundred.
[08:11.15]This is going to take a long, I hope you're ready for the long haul here.
[08:21.09]This top part comes off.
[08:25.75]It's gonna explode.
[08:26.86]It's not- we already tested it last night.
[08:28.46]This thing is a dud.
[08:37.31]Oh god!
[08:49.58]I already don't like this.
[09:06.51]Okay, we're fine.
[09:07.85]Everything's fine.
[09:09.63]Stand up?
[09:10.45]No.
[09:10.99]I can't.
[09:15.14]My back has been bothering me.
[09:17.04]And like, stand up and moving around, I need to sit and work at my desk with my tools.
[09:21.14]That's the Tinkerer, okay?
[09:22.48]Isn't that a good title today?
[09:26.18]Alright, that looks fine.
[09:34.95]Can I get any of these off yet?
[09:39.24]Oh, one of the fins comes off.
[09:45.37]Yeah, no cheating.
[09:46.05]I gotta beat all these.
[09:51.69]Vroom Scale Seated VR.
[09:56.37]I got the wrong settings, but it's okay.
[09:58.67]I'm improvising.
[10:01.88]What is holding this on?
[10:12.16]Is that it?
[10:21.11]If you're just joining us with a... Oh, hold on.
[10:22.67]I think I can get this off this plate.
[10:26.17]No, right here.
[10:26.91]This will come off in a second.
[10:32.49]Guy, like, disassembles a nuclear bomb.
[10:37.34]Sitting in his living room.
[10:38.74]It's not even my living room.
[10:43.61]Office, right guys?
[10:44.97]Alright, am I gonna bloody nose?
[10:59.37]No, am I?
[11:00.79]I can't tell.
[11:04.97]Well, how do I get this off?
[11:11.96]There's blood everywhere.
[11:14.10]If I just didn't know, there's just blood just all over me.
[11:19.29]I'd be so fucked up.
[11:25.05]The whole stream, I'd just have like a faucet coming out of my nose.
[11:31.83]That would be insane.
[11:36.79]There's a lot of screws in this thing.
[11:40.76]How many more screws are there?
[11:44.59]Someone call Kim.
[11:46.33]He doesn't know.
[11:47.15]It's a missile.
[11:53.83]I don't think it's made to be disassembled.
[11:58.24]That's true.
[11:59.36]You're alright.
[12:00.26]Okay, how many more?
[12:03.90]Oh my god.
[12:04.56]I gotta get... Oh, that was a big juicy one.
[12:12.39]No.
[12:12.61]No.
[12:16.26]Whoa!
[12:16.98]Okay, there's the nuclear reactor.
[12:20.72]That's what it looks like inside, guys.
[12:25.48]Huh.
[12:32.07]First ever image of a black hole.
[12:33.47]Alright, so can I get this out?
[12:39.77]I don't think I can get this out.
[12:43.87]Can I pull... I can pull the...
[12:45.54]Don't blow up.
[12:50.94]I gotta get a better fucking view than this.
[12:52.81]I'm sorry, guys.
[12:58.73]Okay, that's better.
[13:07.12]Can this come off?
[13:09.86]What is holding this on?
[13:19.79]Don't explode.
[13:20.43]It's not going to explode.
[13:26.07]Oh, my rocket contest!
[13:31.50]Oh, man, I'm going to win first prize.
[13:34.02]Okay.
[13:48.55]Got it.
[13:51.34]What do I do with this?
[13:51.98]Can I take this apart too?
[14:01.11]I think so, with the wrench.
[14:02.35]Now the wrench?
[14:11.43]I don't, I got no idea.
[14:12.81]Oh, I got no idea.
[14:22.74]Can I do anything else with this thing?
[14:27.55]Whoa.
[14:32.93]Okay, put this down.
[14:33.85]So this is the engine.
[14:37.18]Can this come out?
[14:40.40]Oh, wait a minute.
[14:45.00]Ah.
[14:45.38]Alright.
[14:45.92]These are going to... Look at that.
[14:56.79]Look how extra lazy I am.
[15:04.83]No, I think this is done.
[15:07.97]What do we got left?
[15:09.29]57, we're almost halfway there.
[15:11.22]Can I pull the middle out?
[15:12.54]Yeah, this is where I gotta be careful.
[15:14.80]So, really slowly.
[15:17.12]Like a fucking magician.
[15:21.54]So is the charcoal filter the thing that makes it explode?
[15:25.62]This is the thing to purify the water.
[15:28.55]That wasn't the thud.
[15:31.57]It's going to roll.
[15:32.14]It's going to break the window.
[15:35.38]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[15:37.58]That was going to keep rolling.
[15:38.85]Hold on.
[15:39.33]Give me that.
[15:58.82]No, here we go.
[16:01.16]Hey, I dropped something.
[16:04.26]Yeah, it's over there.
[16:05.92]It's rolling towards the window.
[16:12.53]Ah, shit.
[16:16.21]That's gonna cost some money.
[16:21.57]That's cheap.
[16:22.75]That window's made out of candy ribbon.
[16:26.43]I shouldn't have done the candy ribbon.
[16:28.71]What's in here?
[16:29.32]I think that's it for this.
[16:47.58]Give me another one.
[17:05.66]Stay here!
[17:06.06]This is the brain!
[17:06.78]I gotta get the snippers.
[17:19.27]Yep.
[17:20.19]There it is.
[17:20.73]I'm trying to roll it.
[17:27.66]I'm trying to roll it and break the window.
[17:29.26]Wait a minute.
[17:56.00]No!
[17:58.18]I fucking don't know.
[18:03.74]I thought it was gonna keep rolling.
[18:06.32]Riveting content.
[18:07.32]That would have been funny if it fucking broke the window.
[18:09.58]And you know it.
[18:10.06]Okay.
[18:16.05]Ah, he's still covered in blood from his nosebleed.
[18:19.21]He's losing brain cells.
[18:24.09]What even makes this thing explode?
[18:27.42]This is supposed to be true to life.
[18:32.00]It's reaching there again.
[18:56.39]I don't even know what I grabbed.
[19:03.59]Can I pull this?
[19:04.27]Okay, I can get the panel off.
[19:05.87]There it is.
[19:08.33]There it is, guys.
[19:11.94]Be careful.
[19:21.98]What does it say?
[19:25.38]Explosive Tritanol, SPE-0102-90, total nine kilograms.
[19:31.66]So this is explosive.
[19:35.04]Just sit that there.
[19:35.82]I don't know, whatever that is.
[19:41.58]What else is in here?
[19:46.49]How many parts are there?
[19:49.11]50 parts?
[19:51.07]Am I missing something?
[19:53.11]Where are these other 50 parts?
[19:55.80]Are they inside of this dome?
[19:57.36]Hold on.
[20:04.80]Ricochet.
[20:05.70]That was worth like five points.
[20:09.23]It's still stuck in there.
[20:11.69]Alright.
[20:12.05]Give me the little guy here.
[20:15.05]No.
[20:16.45]I don't understand.
[20:21.39]What is holding us in here?
[20:33.67]How do I get this out of here?
[20:38.07]There's another panel?
[20:50.12]I don't see another panel.
[20:56.26]Whoa!
[20:56.96]This is dumb.
[20:59.38]Alright, here we go.
[21:02.49]I gotta be very careful here.
[21:11.19]Nope.
[21:19.87]Okay, easy.
[21:30.69]Don't let me near a nuclear power.
[21:35.76]It's still being held in?
[21:37.06]There it is.
[21:48.02]Look at that.
[21:50.25]Interesting stuff.
[21:54.53]There's still 42 parts.
[22:03.98]It doesn't explode, apparently.
[22:05.20]Okay, so just set it over here.
[22:08.18]Just put it on the ground.
[22:08.84]This thing's making me nervous.
[22:10.52]What is the other, like, 50 parts?
[22:12.05]What?
[22:12.39]Wait a minute.
[22:54.60]Okay, so it's this thing.
[22:57.80]Oh shit, there's more in here?
[23:04.44]Oh, this is the computer.
[23:06.74]This is the other computer.
[23:07.60]There's two CPUs in here.
[23:08.74]Alright, let's get this off.
[23:18.14]Pliers?
[23:28.20]Oh, Jesus.
[23:28.82]Alright, do I have to take this shit off too?
[23:31.95]No.
[23:39.93]What is this?
[23:40.49]Alright, can I take the top off?
[23:46.39]Yeah.
[23:50.91]Okay.
[23:52.25]What's holding this on?
[23:53.28]CPU connector.
[24:01.14]Can I take this shit off?
[24:03.62]No, none of these need to be removed.
[24:07.26]Damn, that's kind of cool.
[24:08.52]Alright, cool.
[24:10.89]Now, can this be removed?
[24:12.15]It can.
[24:15.87]Nothing in there.
[24:19.73]Last piece.
[24:21.35]We've got... Oh, there's one more internal thing.
[24:23.24]I gotta...
[24:32.82]That's not the right tool?
[24:34.89]And what world are you talking about here?
[24:41.97]No, not yet.
[24:44.59]Where are these other... Oh, shit.
[24:57.87]Okay.
[24:58.85]Does this... That's it for that.
[25:00.53]Nope.
[25:04.49]One piece of there.
[25:05.29]That's it.
[25:09.27]This comes off.
[25:11.53]This comes out.
[25:12.55]Wow!
[25:14.05]That's what it looks like in there.
[25:15.10]Boy, this is so cool.
[25:20.30]Alright, I got the lens off.
[25:39.45]Well, this is where the 50 parts come from.
[25:41.25]My god.
[25:41.81]Wait, can I- is that a reflection?
[25:50.00]Oh.
[25:50.90]I can't see myself here.
[25:51.90]Alright, this is that.
[25:54.00]This is just the toy at the doctor's office for the little kids.
[25:56.58]Is that it?
[26:06.29]Two more parts.
[26:07.53]Bring out the beeper.
[26:36.33]I did it!
[26:43.43]Excellent.
[26:46.61]What's next?
[26:47.47]I unlocked a magnifying glass.
[26:49.82]Am I talking to you?
[26:51.58]Yeah, I am.
[26:55.80]Oh, I hate when it does that.
[26:57.10]So let me just fix myself here.
[26:59.42]What's next?
[27:05.12]I have to take apart a screwdriver, then a rice cooker, and then the Titanic.
[27:12.00]This is gonna be interesting.
[27:17.05]Take apart the Titanic.
[27:18.15]This is, I take, 30 seconds, this is gonna be easy.
[27:20.41]Alright, let's see if this one's quick.
[27:23.09]Get a good look at it.
[27:31.50]Turn it off.
[27:33.28]Turn it off.
[27:38.11]So I've got a magnifying glass.
[27:39.33]Let me just put it out here.
[27:51.85]This is cool.
[27:55.30]That's really cool.
[27:57.98]It just is.
[27:58.48]I mean, it just is.
[28:00.16]Alright, I've got a magnifying glass in this hand.
[28:03.74]I really am the tinker.
[28:04.70]I can't do hammer yet.
[28:08.98]How do I pull this apart?
[28:10.25]Are there screws on the screwdriver?
[28:14.51]Yes, there are.
[28:27.45]I'm not very good.
[28:40.11]Precision is key.
[28:58.24]Get out of here.
[29:00.84]Alright, put this down for a minute.
[29:04.84]What's the last one?
[29:07.47]Ooh, look in there.
[29:09.79]That's where the batteries go.
[29:10.83]Anything else over this?
[29:11.83]No, I think we're done with that.
[29:18.36]Look at that.
[29:20.56]That's so cool.
[29:24.28]I don't know.
[29:24.96]That's a film canister.
[29:32.59]Batteries?
[29:41.37]That's not a screw?
[29:47.42]I'm almost done with this thing.
[29:51.68]There's a little power switch.
[29:56.80]I need the little one.
[29:57.44]Give me the pliers.
[29:59.84]Make this easier on myself.
[30:09.87]That's it.
[30:12.17]18 parts left.
[30:14.38]This little guy?
[30:15.20]Does he have any screws?
[30:31.47]There's such a weird smell in my room.
[30:32.95]Alright.
[30:38.67]Interesting.
[30:41.08]So now let's put it on, there we go.
[30:45.92]One, two, three, that's it.
[30:48.12]Do I have to take the batteries apart?
[30:53.92]Oops.
[30:59.48]I don't know what happened here.
[31:14.18]That's fucking cursed.
[31:22.74]What just came?
[31:27.18]Is it flying around the room?
[31:36.61]I caught that in the corner of my eye.
[31:40.35]I can't get this little tab?
[31:42.05]Come on, give me this little tab.
[31:47.10]Final boss.
[31:51.94]I can't pull these apart.
[31:55.18]I'm an expert disassembler, guys.
[31:57.63]Well, this is definitely the next part here.
[32:01.93]This is the bit.
[32:03.49]This comes out the back way.
[32:04.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:09.89]That's where all these parts are coming from.
[32:11.29]Look at how tiny this shit is.
[32:16.77]Get it in there with the tool.
[32:23.77]And the middle part.
[32:24.65]No, that's it.
[32:26.39]Six more.
[32:26.99]I believe it's right here.
[32:28.63]Yes, it is.
[32:31.00]What do you got in here?
[32:32.06]There's the actual spinning thing with the drill bit.
[32:33.94]I don't think I can get it yet.
[32:36.30]There we go.
[32:38.90]I think that's it.
[32:49.16]There's only one more thing in here.
[32:51.24]What's left?
[32:52.30]Two parts.
[32:53.22]What is it?
[32:56.20]It's the battery, isn't it?
[32:59.88]Is it the battery?
[33:09.69]Oh, I got it.
[33:10.61]No, I didn't.
[33:17.50]I can't get this.
[33:22.02]Shit, what is it?
[33:25.62]Use the gun.
[33:26.14]No, the gun deletes the whole level.
[33:28.01]It makes it so you can't do it.
[33:31.27]Look at my neck.
[33:32.63]Alright, hold on.
[33:44.48]God damn it.
[33:45.12]Okay, how do I get this open?
[33:49.34]How do you open this thing?
[33:56.67]Right here.
[34:04.87]Got it.
[34:05.67]Done.
[34:11.17]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Titanic.
[34:15.42]I have no idea what this is going to be like.
[34:17.30]No, don't replay the level.
[34:18.28]Get out of here.
[34:22.46]I have to destroy the whole Titanic, I guess.
[34:25.51]So, uh, we're gonna go this way.
[34:28.87]I'm gonna stand up for this one.
[34:36.56]Are you kidding me?
[34:41.04]I have to take the Titanic apart.
[34:43.46]Is my chair... There's 151 parts.
[34:47.05]Swab the deck, veggies!
[34:56.93]Oh, the ocean.
[34:58.91]Did we hit an iceberg?
[35:02.57]Is this like a level that's already predetermined?
[35:18.48]I just wanted to put my hand on the railing!
[35:21.93]I just wanted to put my hand on the railing.
[35:24.80]I was going to do a captain bit where I bow on the seven seas.
[35:30.58]Holy shit.
[35:32.90]I'm not going to be able to find that.
[35:41.36]Oh, look out.
[35:44.04]Here comes the iceberg.
[35:48.65]It's just like a drunk fat guy in a chair.
[35:52.11]Hold on.
[35:53.95]I got to get over there.
[36:05.87]explosion okay here we go I need to go fast already I need to go fast I'm gonna be the shittiest like James Bond villain
[36:44.11]You thought you could make it out alive, Mr. Bond.
[36:52.21]Not on my terms.
[37:11.66]Hey.
[37:22.16]The dining room!
[37:23.46]Not the dining room!
[37:29.53]Why did it just come out like that?
[37:35.71]It's sinking.
[37:37.19]I didn't have to do anything.
[37:49.92]Got it!
[38:06.60]It hit the skybox!
[38:10.04]No!
[38:16.44]What the fuck?
[38:24.87]The sky bog is going to shoot back up.
[38:27.23]It's alive.
[38:27.89]That's a whale.
[38:30.10]Oh my goodness.
[38:56.88]Oh no!
[38:58.56]The sentient wall is coming for revenge.
[39:05.18]I don't think this is historically accurate.
[39:19.26]Hold on.
[39:20.54]Hold on.
[39:21.14]Hold on.
[39:22.78]Hold on.
[39:23.20]I don't want to do this again.
[39:29.10]It's hitting the ground under the water.
[39:31.98]Alright, get me in there.
[39:35.84]I'm already seated, so it's good.
[39:44.97]Okay.
[39:48.45]Where's the dining room?
[39:51.25]Oh my God, this is so huge.
[39:56.19]Is the dining room down?
[40:03.47]This place, I don't even know where it is.
[40:04.61]There's no map.
[40:09.61]There's no clipping through floors until I find it.
[40:15.63]Hold on.
[40:16.01]Get out of here.
[40:16.55]Where's the dining room?
[40:25.30]There it is.
[40:36.37]Okay.
[41:01.80]No, no, no, no, not yet, not yet.
[41:03.66]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[41:04.79]Stop, stop it.
[41:07.03]No!
[41:08.01]Come here, come here, come here.
[41:09.57]He's gone.
[41:23.16]Sorry for that interruption.
[41:47.58]What the fuck?!
[41:48.92]I just wanted to put it down!
[41:50.26]I wanted to put it down!
[41:56.48]Just... I wanna... I can't... What?
[42:01.66]No!
[42:02.95]I'm just... I'm trying to do a bit here!
[42:21.32]Why?
[42:24.54]I just put my hand down and grabbed it.
[42:37.17]Are you good?
[42:37.83]No?
[42:38.57]There he goes.
[42:39.05]You know what?
[42:49.45]Fuck it.
[42:49.81]I think we just have to destroy it.
[42:54.15]Alright, this is fine.
[42:59.22]Welcome to the restaurant.
[43:01.82]Yeah, we pride ourselves on highest quality food.
[43:05.38]Do you have a menu I could look at?
[43:08.93]It's a little cramped in here, don't you think?
[43:11.77]I'll take the swordfish.
[43:13.91]My god.
[43:20.68]Nothing can destroy the Titanic.
[43:22.68]I can't even do the bit anymore.
[43:23.88]I was going to set up like three people and have a discussion about the Titanic.
[43:28.62]I can't even do that now.
[43:39.93]You guys are gonna like this one.
[43:41.23]If you watch this, just, hold on.
[43:44.77]I gotta get in there, make people not flip around.
[43:49.05]Is there like, can I put wine bottles anywhere?
[43:50.61]I don't think so.
[44:03.68]Can I go, is there like a captain's chamber?
[44:08.74]Let me just see what's up here.
[44:11.17]There's probably like a Captain's Quarters.
[44:20.96]Right, there has to be.
[44:23.68]Play the Titanic OST.
[44:30.42]Yeah.
[44:31.90]I can't move.
[44:33.70]Let me fix this.
[44:40.36]This is all tangled up on the chair.
[44:43.26]Which way is it going?
[44:49.28]I have no idea, where the fuck is this going?
[44:53.23]How did I wrap this around like this?
[44:55.15]I'm gonna go the other way.
[45:03.79]Saved, alright, we're good.
[45:06.63]Alright, let me put on the Titanic
[45:20.24]Wait, what was that, uh, Celine Dion?
[45:22.72]Wasn't that one?
[45:28.74]That's a definite claim of the VOD, though.
[45:40.99]Alright, bye, VOD.

[48:05.30]Is this the song?
[48:08.24]I don't think this is the song.
[48:30.89]Is this even part of the soundtrack?
[48:54.94]Jack, I don't know if I can... It's not... Look.
[49:00.94]Do you see the sky in front of you?
[49:05.01]Yeah, Jack, it's beautiful.

[60:03.52]Congratulations to all those that were blessed by the sub-dusting.
[60:09.28]And let's go.
[60:10.30]Let's do a rice cooker.
[60:15.81]I think the volume has been lowered to a nice level.
[60:20.13]You can tell me if I'm wrong.
[60:24.89]Alright.
[60:27.89]I don't know what that is.
[60:29.92]Why is there an assault rifle?
[60:31.94]Oh, it's okay.
[60:34.96]Alright.
[60:36.22]Back in.
[60:36.58]Where are my hands over there?
[60:40.22]Let's clean this off real quick.
[60:51.99]Max volume?
[60:52.87]No, I can't do that to people for a long period of time.
[60:56.72]Okay, really loud shit is funny, but imagine if you just clicked on the stream, you just came to the stream for the first time, or you just loaded it, you went to like, oh, Twitter, or I got a notification, and you're not ready for that.
[61:10.28]I don't want to do that for a long period of time.
[61:13.50]Alright.
[61:18.74]Let me get another sip of my coffee.
[61:25.98]Ah, fresh brew.
[61:28.84]Let's go.
[61:31.26]We'll go back to the Titanic and I will do it normally.
[61:33.82]I don't know what that means, it's the left hand.
[61:39.25]Alright.
[61:50.47]I just thought of the dining room hitting the sky box.
[62:04.34]I gotta get out of this level.
[62:09.51]Why am I getting, like, worms vibes?
[62:13.43]Look, there are the worms.
[62:15.09]It's like Worms Armageddon.
[62:19.30]Alright.
[62:21.18]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[62:23.48]Why do I have this in my hand?
[62:29.60]Okay.
[62:32.07]Back to the main menu.
[62:34.78]How am I?
[62:35.06]Am I in frame?
[62:35.72]Can you see me?
[62:36.14]I gotta turn that down.
[62:42.29]That's better.
[62:42.75]Alright, let's take apart a rice cooker.
[62:51.71]Look at it.
[62:52.67]This is so much nicer.
[62:53.73]Look at that.
[62:54.19]Am I out of frame?
[62:58.51]No, no.
[62:59.01]I'm in frame.
[63:07.46]Can I turn it?
[63:10.08]It actually has water in it.
[63:24.89]Don't need that.
[63:27.49]It's dirty.
[63:31.07]Cut that shit out.
[63:37.82]Alright, so we got the button here.
[63:38.94]Can I lift it up?
[63:41.26]The bottom.
[63:42.66]There's a screw on the bottom.
[63:44.40]Can I rip this off?
[63:47.10]I don't think so.
[63:47.78]How many parts are in this?
[63:48.78]59.
[63:49.51]Alright, well this is a screw.
[63:56.31]Oh shit, okay.
[64:02.23]Probably more of this.
[64:03.12]Let me lean forward here.
[64:05.26]Let me get a good lean.
[64:11.41]No, no, no.
[64:17.84]Give me the pliers.
[64:25.64]That's tiny, look at this.
[64:27.20]I gotta get the microscope.
[64:32.84]This is next level small.
[65:05.30]God dammit!
[65:11.76]Let's pick it up.
[65:25.91]Alright, now I can... Can I grab these?
[65:30.63]I can grab this.
[65:32.55]Stop doing that.
[65:33.33]Alright, I need a little screwdriver.
[65:38.63]And, oh, that's a bomb.
[65:43.15]This one.
[65:46.81]Really?
[65:47.09]Look, is it the other one?
[65:52.78]That, I can't get that.
[65:56.70]Shit.
[65:59.58]Am I, am I crazy here?
[66:03.30]No, I'm not crazy.
[66:05.93]I'm not crazy.
[66:08.93]I told you I wasn't crazy.
[66:11.23]Is there another one?
[66:17.65]Now I gotta use this.
[66:21.49]No?
[66:21.75]What tool?
[66:32.20]That's a tiny little screw.
[66:33.52]I didn't think I was gonna need this.
[66:34.56]Okay, there's another one here.
[66:40.35]Ooh, okay, that comes off.
[66:42.65]Beautiful, then this thing's gonna come out.
[66:50.32]Snip those.
[66:51.10]Alright, getting there.
[66:56.76]Snip these with the pliers.
[66:57.98]That felt fantastic to do that.
[67:07.90]I'm not even kidding.
[67:09.46]I'm not even messing around.
[67:14.10]That felt so... I'm not even kidding.
[67:21.77]Okay, there goes those.
[67:25.95]This whole thing, I can... Oh, that's the dirty part.
[67:34.31]Oh, shit.
[67:38.80]Okay, I might have to deal with that later.
[67:40.12]Fuck.
[67:48.01]24 parts left.
[67:51.37]In what world?
[67:52.83]What has 24 parts in it?
[67:58.20]Spring.
[68:03.50]Alright, 24.
[68:10.70]Is this still something I didn't see in here?
[68:12.18]Is this going to come out?
[68:23.69]Oh, look at these screws.
[68:36.68]Oh.
[68:38.26]Is there more?
[68:38.98]There's another one.
[68:41.54]Oh my God, alright, so I think this one's done.
[68:45.38]Anything else in here?
[68:46.16]Yeah, there is, flip it around.
[68:59.21]No, which one, pliers?
[69:08.62]Guys, I don't know where the other 20 plus pieces are.
[69:12.86]Am I missing something?
[69:24.91]Inside the lid.
[69:38.34]Really?
[69:38.66]This is so weird.
[69:46.45]Oh, what?
[69:46.91]A wrench?
[69:49.27]How do I get this out?
[69:55.66]Alright.
[70:01.62]What the hell's going on?
[70:12.22]Hey!
[70:21.66]There we go, got it.
[70:23.84]No.
[70:25.73]Why is it locked shut?
[70:29.59]What the fuck?
[70:31.59]Give me my thing.
[70:40.00]Are there this many things up here?
[70:42.26]that are... Shit.
[71:10.15]No?
[71:11.22]Hey.
[71:12.08]Hey!
[71:13.16]Hey!
[71:25.54]How do I get this off?
[71:31.33]This lid is locked shut.
[71:35.67]Six more parts, apparently.
[71:38.79]Why can I not get in here?
[71:44.81]Check the hinge inside the lid.
[71:46.35]Yeah, I'm trying to, like, wedge it in there.
[71:49.92]You'd think I would be able to... I think I fucked it up.
[71:55.08]This looks like I can move it out, but I can't grab it.
[72:04.00]Wait, what's going on?
[72:07.13]What's going on?
[72:11.14]Was everybody freaking out?
[72:13.70]Stick your face in there?
[72:14.54]I think I might have bugged it.
[72:17.68]Because this was opening before, now it's not opening.
[72:20.28]The hinge is just gone.
[72:29.09]What the fuck do I do about this?
[72:31.57]Because I can't grab this lid.
[72:33.03]Maybe a crowbar?
[72:40.29]I gotta pry this thing open.
[72:47.42]Something ain't right.
[72:48.40]Something ain't right.
[72:50.10]Unfortunately, something's not right.
[72:51.58]It's worth a shot.
[73:04.64]Damn it!
[73:05.61]No!
[73:07.61]Oh, the work!
[73:15.05]Just shoot it.
[73:16.89]Turn it off and turn it on.
[73:17.99]Use another part.
[73:20.15]Uh, I'm curious.
[73:21.29]Is that the only thing that's left?
[73:23.51]Too bad I can't use the hammer right now.
[73:30.50]Okay, there's apparently something right here.
[73:35.02]What is right here?
[73:36.48]This thing?
[73:44.78]This looks like it's more than one piece, right?
[73:54.00]Yeah, it's this thing right here.
[74:04.64]I can't, like, open this?
[74:08.74]Or is it this?
[74:11.06]Oh, shit.
[74:12.47]It's right there.
[74:20.14]What do I need?
[74:21.12]Pliers?
[74:25.66]No, not the wrench.
[74:28.64]Pliers?
[74:29.34]How do I open this fucking thing?
[74:34.48]I can't just grab that?
[74:40.92]What?
[74:44.02]Is something holding it?
[74:46.24]What is holding this on?
[74:47.04]Is there a screw?
[74:57.69]Where's the magnifying glass?
[74:58.87]What am I missing here?
[75:02.89]Look, I think there's a tiny, oh my God.
[75:07.52]Oh, Jesus, okay.
[75:13.38]Don't shoot it.
[75:14.48]Look at this little screw.
[75:18.86]Hey, hey, blink and you'll miss it.
[75:21.93]Is that the regular screwdriver?
[75:29.70]Alright, just that.
[75:30.84]How many more?
[75:31.72]Four pieces left.
[75:35.67]Shit, really?
[75:40.29]This maybe?
[75:44.39]No.
[75:45.65]Alright.
[75:45.93]Let's see.
[75:52.18]Shit.
[75:54.98]I might have to shoot this.
[76:04.45]Damn it!
[76:05.95]What about, is it, maybe it's behind it.
[76:11.19]No.
[76:13.55]Come on.
[76:14.03]I have to ruin the level.
[76:21.48]Just glitch out with it?
[76:23.56]Not a bad idea.
[76:51.25]Open the lid!
[77:16.82]Fuck.
[77:19.76]Now the level's ruined.
[77:28.19]I'm disappointed.
[77:35.06]You don't get a check if you don't do it right.
[77:36.64]God damn it, really?
[77:38.00]A phone, a jigsaw, let's do the car.
[77:48.99]This is a real car.
[77:54.10]Okay.
[77:58.33]How many parts?
[78:00.37]103.
[78:02.63]Cool, cool, look at that.
[78:03.65]Oh, this is a manual.
[78:05.77]Nice seats.

[78:44.57]trip there's too many people in the car it's the clown car hey can you move back a little he's alright did you at least go out the other window
[79:15.13]It's whatever.
[79:15.71]Alright, I need to get in there and drive it.
[79:18.26]This is like a subway.
[79:31.32]Like, oh, Jesus.
[79:32.22]Oh, don't cough on me.
[79:37.74]God.
[79:38.08]Alright, that's good.
[79:43.02]Let's give it a try.
[79:46.37]What is this, some kind of a garage, you think?
[79:47.91]Alright, shut up back there!
[80:05.72]This is why nobody...
[80:20.24]man.

[80:25.96]Alright, here we go.

[81:52.80]Let me go back.
[82:04.56]This is cool, though.
[82:05.70]I like sitting in here.
[82:12.17]Alright, should I load up with clowns and play clown music in the background?
[82:16.19]And then just drive them?
[82:18.05]Maybe like
[82:22.77]Okay, let's go with 50.
[82:26.88]And my computer might crash.
[82:33.44]Stream's probably gonna turn off.
[82:35.12]I gotta place them perfectly though.
[82:39.79]One, two, three, four.
[82:46.42]I feel like I'm hiding in a bunch of stuffed animals.
[83:12.56]You're not going to find me.
[83:23.53]I lost count, I don't even know how many are in here.
[83:42.94]How, is anybody counting?
[83:46.53]Jesus.
[83:48.61]My computer, I, that's it.
[83:50.35]No, that's it, that's it, my computer's gonna break.
[83:55.27]Oh god, I can feel it already.
[83:59.93]That's 42.
[84:02.29]Eight more?
[84:02.87]I can't do that.
[84:15.48]We need 50.
[84:16.38]The stream's going to turn off.
[84:24.95]Funny clown music loop.
[84:30.16]No, that's not a good one.
[84:37.00]Come on, what's like the circus music?
[84:38.76]How do you?
[84:42.39]Am I gonna like upload one of these?
[84:43.93]Should I make one?
[84:54.84]This is circuit, David.
[84:59.68]Okay, here we go.
[85:07.95]Ready?
[87:22.63]What happened to the music?
[87:35.02]I'm running over the cord.
[87:35.88]That was weird.
[87:46.86]Alright, I need to take this apart.
[87:48.14]I gotta do this for real.
[88:00.71]Christ.
[88:03.10]That's too many mannequins.
[88:17.81]I wonder what's going to happen to all this wood.
[88:24.19]See you guys when I stream next.
[88:25.83]That didn't do anything.
[88:28.83]Never mind.
[88:29.15]We're fine.
[88:31.85]We're good to go.
[88:32.55]Alright, restart this before my video card dies.
[88:36.81]Alright, let's get it.
[88:42.33]Let's take it apart.
[88:47.50]Alright.
[88:50.08]How many parts?
[88:51.04]103.
[88:51.08]This should be fun.
[88:55.32]Nice hair.
[88:55.98]Does my hair ever get fucked up?
[89:08.39]Get in there and stay in there before I get angry.
[89:11.55]Does the mirror come out?
[89:14.59]It does.
[89:18.85]Tires.
[89:23.61]I don't think you can do that with a car.
[89:27.77]That's it for the door, right?
[89:40.02]You can't do that either.
[89:41.72]That's true.
[89:42.92]Or this.
[89:45.26]Come on.
[89:59.15]Are you serious?
[89:59.79]I can't lift him with this.
[90:03.79]I know I'm just making my life hard.
[90:11.24]Damage on physics?
[90:11.96]Damage on the car.
[90:13.08]Impressive!
[90:21.14]Goddammit, I was gonna... This is what a windshield is like, huh?
[90:33.44]Okay, ready?
[90:46.21]Whoa, underneath.
[90:50.71]Oh, strap, nevermind.
[90:55.78]Do I need to pull this?
[90:57.00]That, alright, that doesn't break.
[90:58.64]Let's get under the hood.
[91:05.86]Alright, turn it on.
[91:14.88]Let me see if I can find out what the problem is.
[91:21.68]Yeah.
[91:23.98]Well, let me get a better look.
[91:31.80]I think it might be the battery.
[91:37.50]Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
[91:39.52]Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
[91:41.86]Ooh, I'm sorry.
[91:43.18]Give me some juice.
[91:52.55]Ah, no, it's not the battery.
[91:53.55]I think it's the radiator.
[91:56.30]Oh, oh, hot, hot, hot!
[91:58.74]Okay, no more hot joke.
[92:04.80]How is it still on?
[92:09.69]There's no way it's still on.
[92:19.60]There's no way this is still on.
[92:31.47]somebody getting in let me get in there and see yeah it looks like there's a couple of issues here with your glue gun um what did I just do oh that's the that's the oh this is why you pilot the car right what the
[93:04.55]I think that's it.
[93:05.07]Did the dash come out?
[93:08.81]No.
[93:10.27]I want to see if the car will still run after all this.
[93:13.59]Oh, a crystal.
[93:17.81]Blue crystal.
[93:26.74]A dragon egg!
[93:38.38]Alright, I'm gonna have to get some tools here in a second.
[93:41.11]Wait!
[94:07.79]Hold on.
[94:08.31]Why did that?
[94:09.75]Why did that happen?
[94:37.69]Fucking Nintendo Labo.
[94:41.53]Broke my headlight, oh no.
[94:44.90]Jesus Christ.
[95:19.12]That worked.
[95:21.20]Alright, let's get the back fin here.
[95:25.32]What have we got?
[95:26.52]72 more parts.
[95:27.09]Holy God, are you kidding me?
[95:28.65]Wait, did I fail it?
[95:30.33]No?
[95:31.17]Okay.
[95:31.43]I didn't know if exploding was a fail.
[95:39.07]Anything more to the seats besides just the seat?
[95:43.65]Nice, like, gamer chair.
[95:51.86]Wait a minute, is a gamer chair just a car chair?
[95:59.24]It is.
[96:07.22]What?
[96:09.65]It is, isn't it?
[96:17.65]Okay.
[96:19.69]Alright, down here.
[96:22.72]Alright, I'm gonna have to stand up for the next few because I'm actually getting motion sick sitting here doing this.
[96:29.65]After we're done with the car, I'm gonna have to stretch and I'm gonna stand up and move the camera because I'm actually gonna throw up.
[96:34.83]It's just like this.
[96:37.42]Oh no, I gotta get up.
[96:40.54]I gotta get out of this chair.
[96:46.06]Movement without movement is just, you're gonna hurl.
[96:55.02]And plus, this is like, I'm spinning around and coiling myself up like a snake.
[97:12.97]Get this out of here.
[97:20.83]Both mufflers?
[97:22.79]Goodbye?
[97:26.67]I think I gotta unscrew some shit.
[97:30.37]I think so.
[97:34.22]Can I move the car back?
[97:37.38]Alright, no, I gotta stand up.
[97:44.62]Hold on.
[97:48.47]I'm gonna puke.
[97:54.96]I'm going back to standing.
[97:56.02]This is a failed experiment.
[97:57.42]Okay.
[97:59.40]Let's get this out of here.
[98:08.97]Whew.
[98:14.57]Get out of there.
[98:16.07]Get out there.
[98:18.74]Alright.
[98:19.06]I'm gonna move the camera.
[98:26.62]Yeah, I gotta move around.
[98:27.66]Alright, how we looking?
[98:37.48]That's alright.
[98:38.46]Maybe a little bit lower.
[98:42.16]Maybe a whole sleeve of Oreos will make you feel better.
[98:44.34]That's not a bad fucking idea.
[98:48.09]That's not a bad idea.
[98:49.21]Like an entire sleeve?
[98:57.86]A little bit more headroom.
[99:00.38]Alright.
[99:01.62]Let's get untangled.
[99:02.68]I feel better already from standing up.
[99:08.79]Alright.
[99:09.15]Good.
[99:10.53]Very good.
[99:22.81]It's a bit.
[99:25.12]What's a bit?
[99:27.29]No, I'm not joking.
[99:28.75]Do you think I'm joking?
[99:30.99]No, I'm holding back puke.
[99:39.78]I'm kidding.
[99:40.26]I'm kidding.
[99:40.56]I'm kidding.
[99:43.42]Alright.
[99:44.62]Better.
[99:46.14]Let's keep doing this shit.
[99:47.30]I feel better now.
[99:48.15]Already.
[99:48.67]Better already.
[100:02.76]Let's get this shit out.
[100:03.64]So this is a... This is a... No, wrench.
[100:16.04]Wrench, right?
[100:16.68]Get back here.
[100:19.48]Pliers or wrench?
[100:20.38]Wrench.
[100:27.46]Can I do it with pliers?
[100:28.26]No.
[100:37.64]Pop cap.
[100:42.92]I think I need the, uh, yeah, I need the... Although sitting down, you don't do that.
[100:47.38]It's a... It's a brake lock?
[100:58.10]Nice.
[100:58.40]Give me the, uh, give me the, uh, yeah.
[101:10.95]Done with you.
[101:11.41]I think that's it with here.
[101:14.39]Oh my god, what's going on?
[101:16.97]People are giving community subs?
[101:20.93]PixelBlank, thanks for five community subs.
[101:22.77]There was another one before that I missed.
[101:26.55]Big subs.
[101:27.07]Thanks a lot, guys.
[101:30.44]I missed probably a couple that came in, but thank you.
[101:39.90]Oh, PogChamp.
[101:41.95]Nah, thanks a lot guys.
[101:45.09]More community subs coming in.
[101:51.11]That's what I wanted.
[101:57.30]Okay.
[101:59.52]Getting put off.
[102:05.20]These can come off now.
[102:06.52]Alright, now we're just down to like the meat of the car.
[102:12.09]Dude, why doesn't like the gamer chair companies make this?
[102:18.72]It's a double gamer chair.
[102:23.10]Do they make this?
[102:26.06]A gamer couch.
[102:35.38]A gamer couch.
[102:40.69]Uh, what else is free?
[102:41.67]Anything else?
[102:42.15]I got to just do the tires.
[102:43.05]Uh, do all four tires, get it over with.
[102:58.19]Boink.
[103:01.38]I'm gonna use the crowbar.
[103:04.20]Pull this shit up.
[103:09.12]Brake pad.
[103:12.01]It's a turned device, whatever it is.
[103:17.61]Now, how do we get this shit off?
[103:23.04]A wrench for that one?
[103:26.12]Is this connected to something?
[103:30.26]I'm not sure what this is exactly connected to.
[103:32.48]I think I have to get rid of this first.
[103:35.86]I think.
[103:36.32]Let's find out.
[103:46.07]Shit!
[103:51.44]Is there a screw here?
[103:52.34]I don't think so.
[103:54.64]I think it's just wedged in up here?
[104:02.98]Crowbar?
[104:03.50]I don't know.
[104:09.86]Takes a-
[104:16.40]I'm going to flip the car upside down.
[104:25.59]What's that?
[104:26.49]Why is it leaking?
[104:29.05]Alright, this is connected to here.
[104:30.39]There we go.
[104:36.14]Can I pull these off?
[104:37.22]Yeah, I can.
[104:44.85]No, I cannot.
[104:47.37]Said tool required.
[104:48.37]Maybe not.
[104:56.02]We'll find out later.
[104:59.38]I think I can rip this out with the wrench.
[105:02.62]No.
[105:04.46]Alright, let's go for gold here.
[105:09.04]Nevermind.
[105:18.75]Will you please just pick it up?
[105:22.11]I'm about to do it.
[105:22.71]Lefty.
[105:22.91]You ever see somebody hold a javelin like this?
[105:35.88]Just get away from me, please!
[105:37.90]Alright.
[105:47.25]Tool to rip this off.
[105:48.80]Got it.
[105:54.47]I can pull these up now.
[105:56.49]Very nice.
[106:00.78]This is bolted somehow.
[106:02.68]Or is it?
[106:06.38]Okay.
[106:06.86]I didn't think I was going to be able to do that.
[106:09.36]Alright.
[106:10.63]Now I can flip it back around.
[106:18.61]What's left?
[106:19.87]33 pieces.
[106:20.21]I'm going to have to take the whole engine apart.
[106:24.51]Alright.
[106:34.22]This is the orbit.
[106:35.22]This is the tuba.
[106:39.36]Don't tell me you didn't blow into the top of that thing.
[106:41.00]It wouldn't make like four separate weird noises.
[106:53.24]Alright, engine.
[106:59.19]Engine is detached.
[107:01.37]So it's a big staple.
[107:03.77]Now, here we go.
[107:08.10]I think there's more to meets the eye here with this thing.
[107:13.24]Or maybe not.
[107:20.85]Tires.
[107:21.33]And then we gotta go searching for the next little bit here.
[107:31.38]Let's get that in a minute.
[107:38.29]Ooh, I got the turkey leg.
[107:39.71]I think that's it.
[107:49.11]A meowing engine?
[107:50.98]Is it meowing?
[107:51.58]Alright, only a few more things left, I think.
[107:58.06]Yeah, we're down to like the last little bit here.
[108:04.05]Just the two tires?
[108:06.29]Lovely.
[108:25.23]Oh, my God.
[108:30.11]Get out of my way.
[108:30.85]There's the rumor.
[108:38.55]Alright, here we go.
[108:42.61]Yeah, this is it.
[108:43.51]I got it.
[108:44.43]Victory.
[108:47.68]And I'll just tie it right here.
[108:53.78]Finally!
[108:55.51]Took long enough.
[109:00.35]19 minutes.
[109:06.48]We did it, Reddit.
[109:09.84]We did it, Reddit.
[109:11.98]Alright, what else we got?
[109:13.92]Titanic.
[109:16.04]Car.
[109:16.80]Airplane.
[109:17.88]Toaster.
[109:18.46]Coffee grinder.
[109:20.31]Train.
[109:22.19]Deep.
[109:22.67]Tank.
[109:29.74]What do you think?
[109:31.84]Go back to the Titanic.
[109:33.02]I need to, like, stretch.
[109:41.33]My body is so broken.
[109:44.83]Alright.
[109:46.05]Uh... How do I... Okay, I'm gonna say, like, we're gonna pull the bottom out.
[109:56.27]I think that's the most reliable.
[109:57.48]Just rip the bottom out.
[109:58.40]Just take the napkin from underneath all the shit and it'll all fall down.
[110:03.72]Watch this.
[110:12.12]Down, down, down, down, down.
[110:16.36]And what is in here?
[110:17.20]Is it like the engine room?
[110:18.40]Alright, I'm gonna take the bottom.
[110:19.55]I'm just gonna pull the bottom out.
[110:20.49]I'm just gonna take one piece.
[110:26.62]Like right, like down here.
[110:28.02]I'm just gonna rip the whole thing.
[110:29.96]Ready?
[110:38.50]Almost.
[110:46.43]Fucking explosions, man.
[110:47.61]They're so intense.
[110:53.55]It's that easy.
[110:58.13]Or is it?
[110:59.87]I might have to go to the bottom of the ocean and clean this, and rip these apart.
[111:07.63]Well that would be a pain in the ass, wouldn't it?
[111:15.14]God damn it.
[111:20.66]I gotta turn the thing on, it makes me move faster.
[111:22.32]This bubble's just too big.
[111:34.34]Gunshot Pick it up grab it grab it grab it No, I I don't think I'm gonna be able to this is gonna take so long How would you not do how would you do this without like a fucking grenade I
[112:04.68]144 parts.
[112:05.98]I gotta go in and disassemble every stool.
[112:09.12]Oh, there it goes.
[112:12.82]143.
[112:13.00]What's it gonna do? 143.
[112:39.32]I gotta go in and take out everything.
[112:46.41]Alright, give me the super speed.
[112:58.81]This is gonna take forever.
[113:02.01]Because the thing is, if you try to destroy it one little piece at a time, it just explodes.
[113:04.95]It just goes like, boom!
[113:16.45]I'm just like an anime character blasting through this.
[113:24.54]And here we go.
[113:40.61]128.
[113:41.27]I'm just gonna go through the middle.
[113:44.93]Watch this, ready?
[113:45.55]I think I did it.
[113:55.60]Kinda.
[113:59.82]Oh, fuck.
[114:10.15]Here we go!
[114:10.77]I'm sorry!
[114:41.20]I can't stop.
[114:42.18]Can it be done?
[115:01.87]Oh my god, I have 109.
[115:18.12]I'm going to explode.
[115:19.04]I am never going to be able to do this.
[115:28.52]Will you touch anything?
[115:29.84]Look, I'm going to destroy these things.
[115:35.45]No, I'm not.
[115:36.01]I'll see you in like 20 minutes when I make my way over there.
[116:02.98]just gravity gun it's just it's too wedged in
[116:21.97]Alright, fuck it.
[116:23.78]I can't do this one.
[116:24.58]It's gonna take like two hours to do this.
[116:28.22]I'm just gonna suck it up.
[116:32.26]Okay.
[117:02.98]I feel like I'm in the middle of that mission in Half-Life when you first throw the cart into the electromagnetic spectrum thing.
[117:12.59]I can do 70 more times.
[117:32.23]Ah!
[118:10.43]Alright.
[118:11.23]I can't.
[118:11.65]I'm done.
[118:15.61]I'm done.
[118:17.44]I did it.
[118:17.96]I'm done.
[118:25.71]This is going to actually be sick.
[118:37.39]I have no idea where these other 24 pieces are.
[118:49.74]I don't know, they could be anywhere!
[118:56.57]There's 21, I think they could be anywhere.
[118:58.21]There could be any one of these.
[119:17.67]It's 21 still.
[119:22.23]It's not possible.
[119:28.29]Where is the other one?
[119:32.96]Is there any more?
[119:53.71]Does that- does this count?
[120:23.43]Alright, that's it, I'm sorry.
[120:31.35]I don't care.
[120:32.13]I don't care if I get a heart reset on this one.
[120:36.75]My like, psyche is gonna break down.
[121:07.46]No, no, no, no, what are you doing?
[121:09.50]No!
[121:09.74]That's not what I wanted.
[121:19.42]Man, why is this killing me so much?
[121:27.50]Not giving me a headache.
[121:28.28]Imagine the guy inside.
[121:34.71]I got a headache.
[121:35.37]Oh, it's like times 10 headache.
[121:44.35]My friend says you have a long plantain face.
[121:46.81]Oh, good.
[121:49.43]It's fucking chiseled.
[121:51.54]It's chiseled plantain.
[121:52.96]I don't even know what that means.
[121:59.78]Mind show?
[122:00.34]I can't do mind show right now.
[122:03.56]I'm gonna...
[122:09.52]These VR streams are fucking killing me.
[122:13.54]It's like every day I lose.
[122:16.64]Every day I lose a little more energy.
[122:20.57]Doing it like two or three times in a row.
[122:24.01]It's so fun though.
[122:26.71]I think I can do a couple.
[122:27.85]Hold on.
[122:33.46]Plantain's a banana.
[122:36.00]Whatever.
[122:36.52]I've got like a banana face.
[122:37.52]That's fine.
[122:41.91]I want to keep playing that.
[122:43.11]I thought bringing the chair in was going to help.
[122:48.88]I'll bring a chair in and sit down.
[122:50.38]I don't feel like I'm going to throw up.
[122:52.80]It's alright.
[122:54.58]I just need a second.
[122:55.56]We'll go back in.
[123:00.65]Where's my library?
[123:01.41]Alright.
[123:08.11]What happened to it?
[123:10.73]There it is.
[123:11.17]OK, let's go.
[123:25.33]There comes a puking stream.
[123:27.09]No, it was just zooming in really fast.
[123:30.64]Sitting down in the chair.
[123:40.74]Bladen's Sorcery got a big update.
[123:42.10]Maybe we'll check it out.
[123:47.92]Alright, let me get in here.
[123:50.15]Let's do the computer.
[123:50.83]The computer sounds fun.
[123:58.25]I'm gonna be honest.
[124:00.67]Any next game in VR is gonna be like really intense.
[124:03.41]Like Blade and Sorcery, I have to fucking move around and swing around.
[124:08.62]I might not be able to do that for very long.
[124:11.80]I'm getting like that fucking like puke reflex.
[124:18.72]He's from sitting down.
[124:20.34]And you know when you get that, after a while, you get that feeling and then you can't get rid of it.
[124:28.26]This, getting up made it better, and then they're... Oh my god, I was being just attacked.
[124:35.94]Let's do the computer.
[124:44.70]Drone, TV, submarine, some of these are so fun.
[124:49.90]Microwave.
[124:59.36]What is happening here?
[125:07.09]Something is not right.
[125:08.31]That's odd.
[125:24.13]Is it like the pizza?
[125:29.30]Did I fry my GPU?
[125:31.60]I don't think so.
[125:32.34]Hold on.
[125:35.00]Oh, no.
[125:41.08]Oh, no.
[125:41.82]Oh, no.
[125:46.06]No, wait.
[125:49.88]Fixed.
[125:50.96]We're good.
[125:54.06]Yeah, the window wasn't in focus.
[125:57.34]Weirdly enough.
[125:57.90]Alright, so let's do microwave.
[126:05.05]We've got 113 pieces.
[126:07.07]Let's see, let's cook something.
[126:33.58]You know, I've also got metal in the microwave.
[126:41.71]Why is it not doing anything?
[126:42.73]Um...
[127:06.90]We're going to eat good tonight.
[127:41.77]Can't I put my head in here?
[127:42.91]Okay.
[127:51.23]Jesus.
[127:51.61]Alright, let's try it again.
[128:03.04]Did I just... Why is everything so fragile in this game?
[128:08.18]Seriously.
[128:08.66]Look at this.
[128:09.10]Ready?
[128:09.60]Watch this.
[128:12.44]It's just a piece of lettuce.
[128:14.74]It's a piece of lettuce.
[128:17.29]Well, the plating is very important.
[128:18.67]Make sure you put your greens right gently on the plate.
[128:22.99]Oh, whoops, it's fucking broke.
[128:44.21]Just restart it.
[128:46.67]God damn it.
[128:47.21]Alright, forget about this.
[128:50.46]We're gonna open it up.
[128:51.46]What does a microwave even look like inside?
[128:54.80]Probably scary.
[128:58.23]How terrifying is a microwave?
[129:01.77]Microwave the gun.
[129:34.52]Hold on.
[129:38.63]Cooking with Jerva!
[129:55.06]What?!
[129:55.42]I guess I'll have a pizza!
[130:04.95]Oh, it broke.
[130:08.60]What?
[130:10.66]What's going on?
[130:11.18]Alright, I'm going to do it for real this time.
[130:24.88]I broke the pizza.
[130:26.00]Alright.
[130:29.57]Panel, door, back panel.
[130:36.33]Can I get this again?
[130:37.25]I got screws here.
[130:37.97]Oh, I gotta go way too fast.
[130:47.11]There we go.
[130:49.09]This little room, you can't go that fast.
[130:51.35]So let's open this up.
[131:05.17]This one's gonna be cool.
[131:06.83]alright can I get this back panel off no look at that down no hold on
[131:46.41]Cool, that's it for the panel.
[131:52.94]Holy shit, that's what it looks like?
[131:54.88]What a weird machine.
[132:02.68]Can I get that screw?
[132:05.57]I can get that screw.
[132:16.51]Is this top not going to come off?
[132:20.97]I got to cut these.
[132:24.79]Get that off here now.
[132:27.37]Oh, shit.
[132:27.95]Oh, shit.
[132:28.41]What did I do?
[132:28.87]Oh, my God.
[132:30.83]What's happening?
[132:34.93]Oh, it was the glass.
[132:38.77]Okay.
[132:41.53]Alright.
[132:42.95]Broke right in half.
[132:46.31]Can I get this one out too?
[132:49.51]I don't think I have to.
[132:52.82]Get the plate out of there.
[133:00.40]Why do I have to load this?
[133:02.18]Why don't I just get it out of here?
[133:10.61]This little thing here.
[133:12.85]I think I gotta take all these off, don't I?
[133:14.47]Yes I do!
[133:22.57]Really?
[133:26.21]Come on.
[133:36.66]Does this still work?
[133:41.28]Does this still turn on?
[133:45.20]Oh, the door's not on, so it won't work.
[133:52.94]Might need it later.
[134:00.66]What the fuck is this?
[134:02.42]A bulb?
[134:03.88]Oops.
[134:05.34]Whatever, somebody will clean that up later.
[134:09.52]Every time I go like this, I want you to edit it like a lightning strike.
[134:33.36]Screws!
[134:36.80]No?
[134:37.94]Those are screws, right?
[134:52.49]Do I gotta clip it?
[134:55.53]I think those little tiny things are right there.
[135:06.69]I like the little screwdriver.
[135:07.79]It's never used.
[135:14.95]Only the boss baby one is used.
[135:17.09]I want the little one.
[135:21.01]Let's go back to that.
[135:21.73]Give me the pliers.
[135:49.74]Alright, well a fan came out.
[135:50.76]Can I get this off?
[136:01.88]Alright, what was that holding in?
[136:06.67]I was holding this in.
[136:09.13]This piece right here, right?
[136:22.65]You figured I could get this off with, like, the pliers.
[136:31.44]I don't even know what that's connected to.
[136:32.84]Alright, here we go.
[136:41.66]I got a bunch of stray wires.
[136:44.00]Is there a screw?
[136:56.34]Screw?
[137:01.50]Crowbar?
[137:02.12]I think it's too small to put the crowbar in here.
[137:09.30]I'm surprised I can't do these.
[137:10.96]That's not a real table.
[137:20.47]Can I get that?
[137:23.27]Oh shit, flip it upside down.
[137:26.02]This is the problem right here.
[137:27.28]Just figuring it out.
[137:27.98]Okay.
[137:44.40]Now what does that do for me?
[137:45.22]I don't know.
[137:54.09]I just knocked something off.
[138:03.39]I think that's good.
[138:07.05]Can't remove this yet.
[138:07.91]Is it screwed in?
[138:14.08]Nice.
[138:16.12]Now, can I get it off?
[138:37.38]This thing can be moved.
[138:40.07]That's scaring the fuck out of me.
[138:41.35]Stop doing that.
[138:43.83]What is happening?
[138:47.55]It doesn't like when I pick this up.
[138:53.14]Damn, alright.
[138:53.76]This is the middle of there.
[138:54.62]This is where all the radiation comes from?
[138:57.92]Alright, let's go...
[139:07.86]I still can't get into there.
[139:11.28]It's not a real table.
[139:16.42]What is holding this in?
[139:23.95]Electromagnetic radiation.
[139:31.85]I still don't get what's holding all this shit in.
[139:35.21]I guess they're latched in like that.
[139:44.99]Stop breaking my game.
[139:45.97]Come on, I paid good money for this game.
[139:50.05]Alright, I think we're getting close.
[140:03.72]Six, oh my, wow.
[140:06.04]Did not expect 61 parts.
[140:07.72]This is an intricate one.
[140:19.70]Get in there.
[140:20.22]Yeah, after this, we'll play Blade and Sorcery.
[140:33.95]Until I, like, puke and then leave.
[140:40.24]Get your camber ready, because, like, there might be a throw-off on camber.
[140:43.30]I think that's good for that.
[140:56.07]This is still being held in.
[141:01.91]By what?
[141:04.49]Hmm.
[141:16.61]How do I get rid of this?
[141:20.09]Is there a screw?
[141:21.31]Oh, there is a screw, isn't there?
[141:33.37]Is that it?
[141:34.31]Yes.
[141:38.03]Easy, easy.
[141:38.77]Panel can come off, right?
[141:43.55]Yes, it can.
[141:46.49]Excellent.
[141:50.15]Shake out the excess.
[141:50.99]Now these are connected to here, ultimately.
[141:59.14]So the question is, how, why can I not unscrew these?
[142:20.29]Fucking hell.
[142:33.07]Is there a screw?
[142:35.50]Help me out here.
[142:39.38]I can't get this.
[142:41.74]I can't get that off.
[142:45.92]Do I watch wrestling a bit?
[142:46.90]What is going on here?
[142:51.56]What is this paragraph?
[142:55.45]Blood was all over the... Wait, what's going on?
[142:59.63]Did I miss something?
[143:02.13]Oh, that was part four?
[143:03.41]There's a nut on the screw.
[143:08.96]Give me the... Let me get a good look at this.
[143:41.92]I don't know, man.
[143:42.52]I'm kind of confused.
[143:56.59]Nerd neck.
[143:57.63]I mean, I have to be like this.
[143:59.23]Yeah, you unlock tools by completing levels.
[144:09.22]So the more level packs you complete, the more stuff you get.
[144:11.96]I'm kinda stuck here though.
[144:19.54]You can lift these up.
[144:20.12]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[144:20.86]Wait a minute.
[144:21.24]Here are the pliers.
[144:40.85]Come on.
[144:44.85]Fuck.
[144:47.93]No!
[144:52.24]What the hell is this?
[145:03.15]Can I take this off?
[145:05.51]Oh, shit.
[145:09.75]I think I can hold back panel while I... Come on, that was a eureka moment, why?
[145:20.90]Oh, you're kidding me, what?
[145:27.05]Shit!
[145:41.16]I can't tell if it's a screw.
[145:46.77]No.
[145:52.95]No!
[145:53.31]Babe, I'm stumped.
[146:14.50]Because I can't get in here and undo these.
[146:16.78]See what I mean?
[146:26.22]It's like... Oh, there we go.
[146:33.29]I get it.
[146:33.97]I figured it out.
[146:40.99]Yes.
[146:43.20]Lovely.
[146:44.04]Yes, yes, yes.
[146:44.82]Okay, let's get this out of here now.
[146:51.28]Take it all apart.
[146:53.55]Fantastic.
[146:56.25]Plop.
[146:58.29]And this is still connected somehow to something.
[147:02.31]What is this connected to?
[147:09.44]Nothing's even plugged in here.
[147:11.44]These are all just stray wires.
[147:18.41]Can't get under there.
[147:25.63]Nothing's even attached.
[147:27.61]It's just floating.
[147:31.06]Do I have to grab it with the pliers?
[147:39.40]I'm going to throw it out the window.
[147:40.25]Oh, it's been too long.
[147:41.23]Don't do that.
[147:51.79]This doesn't make any sense in the laws of physics.
[148:09.13]Screw right here.
[148:12.27]Is that a tiny little screw?
[148:15.24]No.
[148:23.82]Every connector needs to be disconnected.
[148:25.46]They're not?
[148:25.92]I mean, what is disconnected on this one?
[148:44.04]Can't even tell.
[149:07.00]Oh my god, there's another one of these fucking things.
[149:14.71]Look at this hidden-ass screw.
[149:15.91]Are you serious?
[149:18.51]It was, like, stuffed in here.
[149:19.67]Are there any more, like, hidden screws?
[149:26.12]This still can't come off.
[149:28.92]What?
[149:30.88]Why?
[149:31.44]I'm getting the inside of here.
[149:34.84]There it is.
[149:35.36]Right here.
[149:37.39]Alright, come off!
[149:39.09]Oh, thank God!
[149:41.99]Jesus.
[149:44.02]That took an eternity.
[149:44.90]Now get out of my face.
[149:49.98]Now how do I... Ah!
[150:04.37]Thirty-eight pieces.
[150:08.16]I'm about to shoot it with the gun.
[150:18.73]I need to get in here.
[150:24.89]The bottom right panel needs to be pulled out.
[150:27.27]I mean, is there some magic hidden screw that I didn't get?
[150:31.86]You know what I'm saying?
[150:39.67]There's gonna be some one fucking screw that I didn't get.
[150:43.33]Is that it?
[150:50.80]I can't even tell.
[150:56.97]Screw on the top?
[151:21.04]They're like phantom screws.
[151:23.70]These aren't even real.
[151:28.80]That's already been unscrewed, I think.
[151:31.25]I don't know.
[151:31.73]Look at the side opposite the wires.
[151:55.55]you
[152:24.57]Damn, Jerma.
[152:25.83]It's like you've never disassembled a microwave before.
[152:32.04]Oh, that hurt.
[152:35.46]It's like you've never... Oh, that was good.
[152:37.74]That was a good one.
[152:41.17]What the fuck, man?
[152:46.43]Oh, this is not it?
[152:47.37]I thought that was a screw right here.
[152:48.65]Oh my god, you're killing me.
[152:58.49]Where is this?
[152:59.89]I keep thinking it's here, but it's not right.
[153:07.60]I can't like get into here to like get out of this thing out of here.
[153:32.84]Nothing even in there.
[153:34.01]There's nothing even in there.
[154:02.68]Screw in the center.
[154:34.97]I need a better angle.
[154:40.35]Mom walks in.
[154:43.27]Jeffrey, what the fuck are you doing?
[154:45.86]Jeffrey, Mom!
[154:46.58]I thought we could have gone to the hospital.
[155:02.09]Jeffrey fucking scrapped up his face and got a black eye.
[155:05.79]Trying to take apart the microwave.
[155:08.78]Give it to me.
[155:15.42]Give me the microwave.
[155:28.92]Press life alert.
[155:33.15]Ugh.
[156:24.53]No!
[156:27.72]That's... Are you sure?
[156:41.27]Where'd it go?
[156:45.57]Where'd it go?
[156:46.07]Where'd it go?
[156:47.17]Right there.
[156:53.46]That's not it.
[157:03.32]I don't know.
[157:04.90]I can't do it.
[157:05.68]I don't know where the last little... I gotta pull this apart.
[157:10.10]Wait a minute.
[157:26.92]Damn it, I was thinking...
[158:42.61]Micro wheel.
[158:44.57]No!
[158:51.86]Make sure the connector on the wires is disconnected.
[159:09.41]Dermot is in the north corner.
[159:16.97]Please, for the love of God, try the bottom connectors on the motor.
[159:20.44]That's what I'm trying to do.
[159:22.44]I can't get them.
[159:25.18]I tried it like five times.
[159:32.17]See, like they can only go back this far.
[159:36.31]And I can't do anything with it.
[159:41.33]You stupid fucking game.
[159:42.78]Are you serious right now?
[159:50.23]I did it!
[159:55.69]You just gotta get your whole head in here.
[159:59.62]That didn't even do it.
[160:02.84]That didn't do anything.
[160:05.83]No, it didn't do anything.
[160:23.20]No, what was that screw for?
[160:27.54]What was it for?
[160:46.05]The middle inner microwave.
[160:51.84]I'm going in.
[161:23.08]Other side?
[161:23.84]What do you mean other side?
[161:32.96]I can't even get the damn panel off!
[161:38.27]I think I give up.
[161:43.49]I can't like reliably get my fucking hands in here.
[162:32.23]UGH!
[163:17.63]No, no, that was it.
[163:19.23]That was the end.
[163:21.09]That was it.
[163:22.75]What happened?
[163:23.17]What's wrong?
[163:29.21]What's wrong here?
[163:37.07]Just unscrew the side panel.
[163:38.95]What are you talking about?
[163:40.65]I've unscrewed every screw.
[163:51.46]There's nothing holding this shit.
[163:54.92]There's nothing here anymore.
[164:05.85]What?
[164:07.71]What?
[164:08.39]This is just floating in midair.
[164:26.90]wiggle the connectors,
[165:39.10]Paul, the connector's down.
[165:44.04]Aren't they all down already?
[165:52.51]The bottom panel is red.
[165:59.77]Bottom panel, bottom panel.
[166:01.83]Guys, you're talking about right here, right?
[166:04.88]This is what you're talking about.
[166:05.82]You're talking about this panel?
[166:06.68]Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you're talking about?
[166:12.22]Where's the screw?
[166:14.50]Where is it?
[166:16.36]That's not a screw.
[166:17.74]I can't remove this.
[166:21.39]This thing's all fucked up.
[166:24.41]There is no way to remove this.

[167:28.14]That's not a screw.
[167:37.62]It's almost like this is screw was supposed to be here, but it's like a JPG.
[167:50.69]It might be broken like the rice cooker was.
[167:54.01]Hex key?
[167:54.93]No, there's no indicator.
[167:57.25]There's not even an indicator.
[168:00.03]There would be an indicator.
[168:01.01]Watch.
[168:02.87]There's no indicator.
[168:06.23]This thing just doesn't exist.
[168:13.48]Have I really been just scouring this whole thing and it just glitched out and I can't even do it?
[168:39.08]Smart click?
[168:39.86]No, there's nothing here to unscrew.
[168:42.76]There really isn't anything to unscrew.
[168:45.51]It looks like that, but there's a...
[169:08.47]Where's the screw?
[169:11.42]Where's the screw?
[169:21.94]Didn't exist.
[169:25.34]There was no screw.
[169:31.39]That was so long.
[169:48.63]There's no screw.
[169:49.91]I got baited into 45 minutes of microwave prep.

[170:59.12]Shouldn't the power supply be down here?
[171:00.88]This person installed this upside down.
[171:06.96]It's supposed to look like this.
[171:11.69]But... Right?
[171:19.95]Doesn't the power supply usually sit at the bottom and the
[171:23.35]People do a hanging power supply like that?
[171:29.24]They're not even fucking computer experts.
[171:37.92]Okay, there's the little, this'll all come off.
[171:40.98]It's a daisy, I don't know what that was.
[171:42.44]It's the heat sink.

[179:52.15]Can I pull this apart now?
[179:53.37]Yeah, whoa.
[179:58.00]There you go, that's what it looks like inside.
[180:04.90]Take a look at the teeth.
[180:08.42]And I think that's it.
[180:10.73]I can't pull this out, can I?
[180:11.71]Alright, yes I can.
[180:14.21]Alright, see you later.
