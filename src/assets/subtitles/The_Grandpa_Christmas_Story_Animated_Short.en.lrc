[00:08.72]The story you'll hear is heartwarming and charming, although some of you may find it alarming.
[00:17.26]On a napkin I write some ink and a nail.
[00:20.86]I'm writing, of course, from the old county jail.
[00:24.00]Those fuckers got me, as you can plainly see.
[00:27.86]What do I do now besides take a pee?
[00:33.11]Arrested for much, I'm about to explain.
[00:36.01]Sit back and relax.
[00:37.54]while my words entertain.
[00:39.29]Our story unfolds on a cold Christmas Eve, a two pairs of socks night, if you could believe.
[00:48.46]The TV was loud and just how I like it.
[00:51.33]Farted 30 times.
[00:52.97]Trust me, I counted.
[00:54.81]What a glorious night.
[00:56.31]Not a care in the world.
[00:58.03]Nothing could ruin this, all of this, uh, this great... I'm having a really good time.
[01:05.00]Really, I can't think of what rhymes with world for this current situation, so it was just fun.
[01:10.87]Sipping my tea and eating my crackers, an annoying voice came up through the rafters.
[01:17.14]It's Christmas Eve, Grandpa.
[01:18.74]This is not good.
[01:20.14]There are no gifts from you underneath that hood, of that beautiful tree that we spent so much time making.
[01:25.98]I'm not messing around, and I am not faking.
[01:28.52]Get your ass out of that chair and into the snow or Christmas is ruined.
[01:32.78]Hurry up and go.
[01:34.93]Jerma sucks.
[01:36.15]That's all that needs to be said.
[01:37.57]I really wish he would permanently go to bed.
[01:41.15]Standing up from my wonderful man station.
[01:44.08]God damn it, my procrastination.
[01:47.18]Stores were all closed.
[01:48.66]Nothing was open.
[01:49.86]This newfound bad news.
[01:51.42]I was having trouble coping.
[01:53.19]I had to think fast.
[01:54.45]There was just no more time.
[01:56.23]I was all out of options.
[01:58.35]So it came to a crime.
[02:02.10]The night came quick and I acted with swiftness For there's only so much you can steal on Christmas Out through the door there was no looking back It was time to rip off a neighborhood ass crack Down the street I trotted on my imaginary horse The hallucinatic drugs I took were running their course Threw my body in blood and made things all hazy This house looks good, but was I going crazy?
[02:28.72]There was nobody home, not a light in the house.
[02:31.42]I got off my steed and creeped close like a mouse.
[02:35.02]Dressed all in black from my head to my toe, I smashed through the front window with a perfect brick throw.
[02:41.46]Climbing through the clearing, I slitted like a snake.
[02:44.36]No one's home, though.
[02:45.76]I could have been a fucking earthquake.
[02:47.91]Once inside, I went right for the jewelry, because that's the most expensive.
[02:52.01]There is no tomfoolery.
[02:54.17]On my way out, I left an IOU.
[02:56.97]If I ever would pay it.
[02:58.51]Not sure if that would be true.
[03:00.75]Into the brisk wind from which I first came, a cruiser was waiting.
[03:05.47]They were ready to tame.
[03:07.00]This old man can still run, I shouted and screamed.
[03:10.16]A sharp pain I felt shooting into my spleen.
[03:13.14]I was feeling the wrath of over 5,000 volts.
[03:16.18]My body struck down like a lightning bolt.
[03:19.56]A taser, really?
[03:20.76]I'm an old man, for Christ's sake.
[03:23.08]Every single inch of my body did ache.
[03:26.17]Into the back of the cruiser we rolled through the night.
[03:29.51]I heard them joke and giggle about my pathetic attempts to fight.
[03:33.69]I don't blame them though, it was really dumb.
[03:36.62]Would I take it all back?
[03:37.96]Was I feeling numb?
[03:39.22]Do I plead insanity?
[03:40.48]Shit myself in the backseat?
[03:42.08]Punch myself in the face and blame it on Wall Street?
[03:45.53]No, I think not.
[03:47.91]I'll do my time.
[03:49.79]I've made the mistakes put forth in this rhyme.
[03:53.10]Sitting in this cell with much time to think.
[03:56.48]Not being with the people I love really does stink.
[04:00.68]So remember this tale this holiday season.
[04:04.00]Don't do dumb shit for absolutely no reason.
[04:08.66]Happy holidays, everyone.
