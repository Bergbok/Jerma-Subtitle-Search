[ve:61.7.100]

[00:06.41]That was really bad.
[00:08.07]Do it louder.
[00:13.72]No.
[00:14.02]Alright, so what do I want to do?
[00:18.28]I got a few options here.
[00:19.14]Let's see.
[00:21.32]I could do... I could play Isaac.
[00:30.00]Oh, what about... Ooh.
[00:32.12]Ooh.
[00:34.09]What about Chop Goblins?
[00:35.51]This has been on the list for a long time.
[00:36.77]I think this is pretty short.
[00:38.95]Isn't this only like an hour or two?
[00:47.35]This is like less than an hour, isn't it?
[00:51.50]Yeah, let's do that.
[00:52.22]That sounds fun.
[00:59.84]Yeah, I'm going to give it a try.
[01:02.78]Give me one sec.
[01:06.55]Uh, you should see it momentarily.
[01:16.26]Keep the title.
[01:23.14]Keep the title.
[01:29.63]Yeah.
[01:30.33]Let me see.
[01:35.35]I love how there's a Chop Goblin's Game of the Week edition.
[01:40.57]Cool.
[01:40.97]Alright, now I'm gonna get it.
[01:41.79]Yeah, it's a little, uh... It's an FPS.
[01:54.08]Made by... What's the Dusk Dev there?
[01:57.26]What's his name?
[01:57.72]Uh, the stream is probably gonna lag for a minute because I'm downloading a game.
[02:08.14]So we might F for a minute or so here.
[02:16.84]Alright, here we go.
[02:19.48]Let's give it a shot.
[02:22.40]That was quick.
[02:29.56]Alright, I already love it.
[02:31.77]I already love this game.
[02:41.24]I do need to change my capturing though.
[02:49.20]Will it capture it?
[02:50.16]Hey, there it is.
[02:53.08]Okay.
[03:02.45]I already love it.
[03:03.13]All right, look sensitivity is going down.
[03:04.33]Let's try that.
[03:06.85]Kids mode.
[03:08.97]What is kids mode?
[03:17.65]oh listen to this wow whoa the music is oh oops I didn't mean to do that all right let's do it okay select difficulty what levels with no enemies or ui
[03:47.60]You're new to PC shooters or just want a chill experience.
[03:50.30]That's kind of chill.
[03:54.56]This is a chill stream.
[03:56.68]The intended balance for a first playthrough or goblin mode.
[04:03.00]I'll do this one.
[04:06.74]The year is 1984.
[04:08.40]On a whim one evening, you decide to break into the local museum's basement and see what sort of treasures it might hold.
[04:14.69]One dusty wooden chest catches your eye.
[04:16.97]You open it, and a mob of strange creatures leaps out.
[04:20.59]This particular chest was secretly a prison for the Malevolent Chop Goblins, lured inside by the promise of delicious cheese and trapped for untold eons.
[04:30.55]They are now loose to wreak havoc on the world once more.
[04:33.59]you know what must be done grabbing an antique dagger from a pile of dusty artifacts you give chase antique dagger you grab from a nearby crate not the best weapon it's better than nothing and a skilled welder might be able to deflect thrown projectiles with it you can also do a quick dagger attack at any time regardless of what weapon you have out by pressing the use button whoa
[05:03.51]Alright, I gotta turn sensitivity down.
[05:07.82]Uh, hold on.
[05:12.16]Okay, let's try it.
[05:24.09]Uh, it's gotta go even lower.
[05:38.54]It's too low.
[05:41.95]I'm sorry, it's too low.
[05:44.23]I'm gonna say 40.
[05:44.95]All right, this is close enough.
[05:51.03]I can't get it to where I want it.
[05:52.17]40, that's fine.
[05:56.79]All right, Goldilocks.
[05:58.44]Sensitivity is probably the most important thing in PC gaming.
[06:03.66]I don't care if you have a GTX 3090, an RTX 4080, six monitors and like a fucking i10, like 55 million.
[06:15.34]If your sensitivity is wrong, you're going to do dog shit in games.
[06:26.43]I like this.
[06:28.07]It's fast too.
[06:29.01]It's very fast.
[06:32.92]I'm going to turn it down just a little bit, though.
[06:38.40]Okay.
[06:40.67]So, chop coin.
[06:52.25]Oh, shit.
[06:56.09]How do I parry?
[06:57.63]There was a parry button, right?
[07:00.48]Am I making that up?
[07:04.66]Got some ammo.
[07:15.76]Scared the shit out of me.
[07:17.54]Grandma, what are you playing?
[07:18.34]This is Chop Goblins!
[07:26.32]The speedruns of this game are probably crazy.
[07:31.57]Okay, fire.
[07:32.27]Can I take that?
[07:33.29]That was really stupid.
[07:34.35]That was a really dumb thing to do.
[07:35.69]Do I have a map or anything?
[07:51.56]There's a gun right there.
[08:06.44]You know if the Dusk Dev is working on this and there's a weapon like this in the game, it's going to be clean.
[08:14.89]I'm just saying.
[08:18.19]Yep.
[08:23.51]How do I take out the other weapon?
[08:26.17]Wait, I didn't check the other thing down here.
[08:32.48]There's another door.
[08:34.54]Where was it?
[08:35.64]Oh no, just wrapped around.
[08:40.46]Soda?
[08:41.42]Oh my god, the tannins.
[08:42.22]I forgot about my tea.
[08:43.88]Why did nobody remind me?
[08:44.66]I gotta take these bags out.
[08:55.80]One.
[08:55.94]The other one's like all the way at the bottom.
[08:58.76]Hold on, I think I can get it.
[08:59.50]I just burnt the shit out of my hand.
[09:04.75]I just reached into the tea.
[09:07.09]I just burnt my finger.
[09:08.41]It's alright.
[09:11.21]I'll live.
[09:13.37]Okay.
[09:13.81]Oh boy.
[09:14.19]Yeah, this thing's full of tannins.
[09:18.71]Alright.
[09:22.87]Get him next time.
[09:25.33]Test.
[09:31.63]No, we're good.
[09:36.45]Did I get a soda?
[09:50.56]There's no jump, interestingly enough.
[09:57.42]Hey, good thing I was playing Resident Evil right before this.
[10:00.62]Because I feel like I'm doing very well.
[10:03.42]Alright, where's, um... Oh, it's E. When you have a different weapon.
[10:08.32]I don't think I can switch between the two.
[10:18.21]Very good.
[10:21.55]Oh, right click does it too.
[10:22.79]Right click is way better than E.
[10:36.10]think I can reflect those what do the chop coins do oh that's a good question
[11:05.90]Ooh, can I get one of these?
[11:06.72]You get plenty of ammo, which is good.
[11:19.58]Okay, I think I got everything.
[11:26.60]Let's go out.
[11:29.18]Are you naked right now?
[11:32.10]Um, no.
[11:32.76]I'm actually kind of... I'm pretty sweaty right now.
[11:41.32]Does anybody know if any of those... You know those desk air conditioners?
[11:45.38]Are those things real?
[11:49.42]I kind of like need one.
[11:50.45]Alright, I need a key.
[12:00.95]They suck.
[12:02.25]I figured it was kind of meh.
[12:05.29]Why would I do that?
[12:06.13]I tried to pick it up with the E and I stabbed it.
[12:14.04]fan they're not fans they're these weird chilling machines they have to vent outside of a window hmm
[12:41.57]Don't hit that.
[12:42.89]Oh my goodness, there's a lot in here.
[12:43.93]I should have just lured them all down.
[13:00.73]Whoa!
[13:02.57]A big coin.
[13:06.49]This is a really British stream.
[13:12.33]Oh, wait, I didn't get all the things.
[13:15.58]The Chop Goblins have escaped the museum and are running amok on the streets of your city.
[13:20.70]Sounds of wanton destruction greet you as you exit the front doors.
[13:26.60]You catch a glimpse of several Chop Goblins disappearing into an alley.
[13:29.58]With shock, you realize they are carrying the crown jewel of the museum's collection, the ancient Aztec time manipulation tablet.
[13:37.54]that precious artifact, they could wreak havoc not just on your city, not just on the world, but on time itself.
[13:45.73]You know what you must do.
[13:48.10]The Chop Goblins... The Chop Goblindas are sort of like Smurfette, except huge, angry, steeped in 1950s stereotypes, and there's way more than one of them.
[14:00.48]Goblindas don't need cleavers to do damage.
[14:03.10]They attack with cutting words alone.
[14:06.34]Keep some cover handy.
[14:08.46]Flinch them if they start winding up, and whatever you do, don't insult their hairstyle.
[14:14.33]What?
[14:21.10]Oh my goodness.
[14:22.39]Oh no, they chopped down the building.
[14:32.85]They're chopping down the buildings.
[14:35.79]We gotta go.
[14:45.06]Stop them.
[14:48.49]Wear one of these.
[14:49.65]It's a baseball hat with a fan in the brim with a hole in it that's pointing down at your head.
[14:58.26]That's... Actually, I kind of want to try it.
[15:03.02]I kind of want one of those.
[15:04.03]Is that weird?
[15:29.50]Almost dead.
[15:31.42]Okay, I gotta heal.
[15:32.28]Almost dead.
[15:42.24]Is this still the Resident Evil 4 remake?
[15:49.76]What am I doing?
[15:55.16]Ooh, new weapon.
[15:56.70]Yes.
[15:57.98]Streets.
[15:58.58]A shotgun.
[16:13.36]Oh shit, okay.
[16:15.02]Alright, not bad.
[16:31.07]Bathroom.
[16:36.27]You can play Stalker too when it comes out.
[16:39.28]Um, I think the stalker games, my brain is not big enough for them.
[16:43.94]Whoa, how do I get in there?
[16:53.84]Although I did play the those old stalker games.
[16:57.54]What was it on like master difficulty or something?
[17:04.42]I played it on some difficulty that was really, really, oh no, like realism.
[17:07.52]It was like realistic mode or something.
[17:09.12]What was it called?
[17:13.58]It was a different mode.
[17:15.82]People said, no, no, play on that one because that's like the best one to play on.
[17:20.16]Something like that.
[17:27.13]It was Masteria.
[17:32.13]It is the recommended way to play even if you're not good
[17:45.57]I want all that.
[17:46.13]Yeah, I just didn't really get into them.
[17:55.58]I tried playing, what was it?
[17:59.49]There was an extensive, this is years ago, this is like four or five years ago now, right?
[18:03.24]There was an extensive argument, and well, debate is probably better to say than argument, on what game I actually should have been playing.
[18:11.82]Because there's like two or three in the original series, right?
[18:14.94]Jesus.
[18:17.42]My God.
[18:26.56]That was a little ridiculous.
[18:50.78]You have the key.
[18:51.70]Ooh.
[18:52.02]Well, let's go do it.
[18:57.28]What about Ultra Kill?
[18:59.84]I'll play the new Ultra Kill patch.
[19:01.90]I'd like to wait a little bit longer though.
[19:09.80]I'd rather wait till at least a couple more chapters are there to play.
[19:23.82]How much is even left of the game?
[19:30.92]Is there one or two chapters left?
[19:32.10]Maybe three chapters left?
[19:34.68]I want to get up there.
[19:36.58]Hmm, how do I get up there?
[19:50.17]This game jams.
[19:52.65]Yeah, this is nice.
[19:59.57]There's no jump button.
[20:09.30]I like games that have little secrets.
[20:10.86]Like this.
[20:19.97]So there is a combo meter up there.
[20:21.63]Okay.
[20:32.38]They've locked the fence.
[20:34.88]What?
[20:35.98]I need bolt cutters.
[20:39.21]You missed a lot of secrets.
[20:41.77]Oh, man.
[20:42.03]I love when games have secrets.
[20:44.77]Oh, man.
[20:45.33]I really love when a game has secrets.
[20:46.93]Like, I could go that way.
[20:47.81]I could go over there.
[20:48.55]I could look that way.
[20:56.02]How do I get up there?
[20:56.56]Is there a jump button?
[20:58.28]I just don't know what it is.
[21:01.69]I found a wand charge.
[21:12.44]Is it alt?
[21:13.38]Space?
[21:13.92]Control?
[21:14.58]No.
[21:17.80]Cool.
[21:24.55]Uh oh!
[21:27.31]There's a new enemy.
[21:35.91]I don't even know what they yell and if you're in line of sight it hurts you.
[21:40.18]What are they saying?
[21:48.44]We want to have cheese.
[22:09.35]Yeah, that's what they're saying.
[22:10.09]They're going, where's the cheat?
[22:11.69]It's the lore.
[22:39.12]Or again.
[22:43.76]Come here.
[22:49.47]Here's some cheese.
[22:54.97]Where's the cheese?
[23:25.81]Holy shit.
[23:27.91]What's happening?
[23:32.98]Oh, bolt cutters.
[23:33.72]Let's go.
[23:38.70]There's a gamer slow-mo?
[23:40.30]Nice.
[23:40.61]I think that's it.
[23:52.21]Oh boy.
[23:56.67]Gamer slow-mo.
[24:24.47]You can switch weapons?
[24:25.25]I mean, I like the shotgun.
[24:28.09]Alright, I got the bow cutters.
[24:33.91]Let's go.
[24:43.20]You're related to these goblins.
[24:45.36]Hey, hey, yeah.
[24:51.17]Back off.
[24:53.65]Hey.
[24:54.91]Back off.
[24:55.41]How's that sound?
[24:56.91]What did that button do?
[25:08.10]There was an extra button.
[25:08.84]What is it?
[25:09.26]What is it?
[25:09.74]Where were those...
[25:22.09]Where's the fence?
[25:22.87]Not back here.
[25:23.37]It was way back.
[25:28.59]Goblin.
[25:29.10]Calm down, bro.
[25:34.86]Hey.
[25:37.44]Here's an idea.
[25:39.34]And just like kind of put this around your brain for a second.
[25:42.86]Back off.
[25:50.88]Jesus.
[25:55.78]Time portal, let's go.
[25:56.64]Why is he so pissed?
[26:10.92]Hey, back off.
[26:19.74]A whirl of colors passes by, and you emerge from the time portal, gasping for breath.
[26:25.17]After a moment, you survey your surroundings, and it doesn't take long for you to comprehend the Chop Goblin's plans.
[26:32.89]You're in the castle of Count Dracula.
[26:36.01]They must mean to wake him from his eternal slumber, to aid them in their evil rampage.
[26:44.07]A strange weapon lies in front of you, seemingly fashioned to hurl wooden stakes.
[26:48.27]Left here by a doomed vampire hunter, no doubt.
[26:50.17]It'll probably come in handy for the battle that's about to take place.
[26:55.06]The Nospratus are Dracula's fearsome feline pets, created through dark vampire magic.
[27:02.48]Now they've joined forces with the Chop Goblins.
[27:04.04]Keep your distance and watch out for their lunge attack.
[27:07.47]Oh, hell yeah.
[27:13.30]MK Impaler.
[27:18.29]Nice.
[27:31.82]Clean.
[27:34.34]This- I like this zone.
[27:35.36]This zone is cool.
[27:51.37]There's one more.
[28:00.10]Did you ever have a goth phase?
[28:03.14]No.
[28:07.30]I did not.
[28:07.74]A goth phase.
[28:34.03]You should start now.
[28:37.94]I don't think I want to start the goth phase at 40.
[28:42.10]I don't know if I want to do that.
[28:52.72]Why not?
[28:53.12]Because I don't think I can pull that shit off at 40.
[28:57.39]I can't pull that off right now.
[29:05.50]Yes, you can.
[29:06.08]I don't think... Uh-uh.
[29:10.98]I don't think I can pull it off.
[29:11.82]Whoa.
[29:24.36]Not with that attitude, you know?
[29:25.48]Can I get in there?
[29:31.55]Goth is ageless.
[29:33.65]Being goth is ageless.
[29:36.35]Yeah, I'm just telling you, I don't think I could pull it off right now.
[29:47.38]Both is a lifestyle.
[29:52.03]Yeah.
[30:02.84]One day should I just turn on the webcam and just have just like straight, straight black hair.
[30:09.86]Like do like put like powder all over my face or something and have like dark, like put like bags into my eyes.
[30:16.30]Wear like a cloak.
[30:19.18]Be like Count Dracula for a day.
[30:20.74]Okay, hold on.
[30:28.40]This is like a puzzle.
[30:29.04]I need to figure this out.
[30:35.53]Oh my goodness.
[30:36.15]These things are kind of scary.
[30:45.10]Just do it on Halloween.
[30:48.92]Okay.
[30:50.44]I might.
[30:53.64]I might.
[30:54.20]I don't know.
[30:56.42]I can't.
[30:57.28]This is not a Roblox birthday party, promise.
[31:01.51]Wait, what am I doing?
[31:02.13]I didn't touch that.
[31:06.94]A door somewhere has opened.
[31:18.50]I kind of already have done this in a way with the whole like, oh, like Lucius Malfoy.
[31:25.22]Didn't I?
[31:25.88]Kind of.
[31:35.58]That does not count.
[31:38.35]I don't think Bugleberry, no, Bugleberry is not goth.
[31:43.21]I don't, I don't know about that.
[31:44.29]All right, what door opened?
[32:01.92]Bugleberry to me is like, are you afraid of the dark Nickelodeon?
[32:05.96]That's like whatever that is.
[32:09.54]Like, campy horror?
[32:10.96]I don't know what you would call it.
[32:19.22]Oh, it's opened.
[32:25.18]Did he tell you to say that?
[32:26.56]No, I'm just... It's an observation.
[32:35.12]Yeah, he's like a Goosebumps villain.
[32:36.91]Yeah, yeah.
[32:37.59]Like, are we afraid of the dark?
[32:38.77]Loose bugs?
[32:43.16]I have been told that that is the intent.
[32:47.38]The intent of that.
[32:49.10]That is what I have been told.
[32:50.78]That that's what they were going for.
[32:52.06]That's what he's been going for.
[32:59.28]Who told you that?
[33:03.32]Hey.
[33:03.94]Hey.
[33:05.76]Back off.
[33:18.49]I wonder what he's up to.
[33:30.58]True.
[33:31.00]Yeah.
[33:31.71]I wonder what he's doing.
[33:34.15]That looks like something I should put up there.
[33:35.89]Wait.
[33:38.97]These things take a lot of damage.
[33:52.78]hell is that no honestly what the hell is that vamp dude come on man I'm gonna show this but like what the fuck are people doing this is on red bubble oh my god why hold on a second
[34:25.99]This is apparently like a throw blanket on Redbubble.
[34:33.40]Okay.
[34:49.35]No, I don't want to do it.
[34:51.25]I don't want to do it.
[34:52.03]I'm not doing it.
[35:00.11]It's this fucking picture where I got, like, the sun in my face from, like, TwitchCon, like, 2017 or something.
[35:06.75]I don't even know when this is.
[35:07.71]Oh my goodness.
[35:14.00]Alright.
[35:21.68]Wait, people actually own this thing?
[35:23.52]What?
[35:26.96]What?
[35:30.06]no I okay I'm gonna stop giving this attention all right let's go let's keep playing this game we have a plan vampire oh my goodness gracious okay it's better that you don't know
[36:00.15]Bro.
[36:01.11]Alright.
[36:11.56]How many masks do I need?
[36:17.12]Am I going backwards?
[36:30.82]Yes, I am.
[36:39.06]You know, one of the reasons why Bugleberry is, like, I would say one of my... He's, like, one of my favorite characters.
[36:48.93]I love Bugleberry.
[36:52.30]I just love that old kind of Vincent Price...
[36:57.14]horror kind of campy jokey but not really a lot of inspiration from that sector there oh my god that scared me I mean character I mean he's a character he's a character right you know people describe people like that he's a character
[37:25.74]Um, where is this thing with the masks?
[37:33.71]I haven't been paying that much attention.
[37:34.83]All right, where am I going from here?
[37:44.61]Hmm.
[37:47.23]I'm kind of lost.
[37:50.84]Was it down?
[37:58.31]I think I'm just walking in circles.
[38:01.71]Oh, okay.
[38:02.11]Hold on.
[38:15.00]This is new.
[38:15.62]Alright, that's a third mask.
[38:39.26]This is mobile game ad level of gameplay.
[38:41.80]What do you mean?
[38:42.46]From me?
[38:42.82]I mean, I was reading chat and talking.
[38:46.28]Yeah, here it is.
[38:46.76]We're good.
[38:47.10]I know where I am.
[38:49.38]We're right here.
[38:49.86]Ooh.
[39:05.98]Uh oh.
[39:08.38]Preparing me for something.
[39:55.41]Alright he's dead.
[40:04.42]What was he even saying?
[40:11.28]That was adorable.
[40:14.58]Again, you emerge from the time portal, Dracula's foul baritone echoing in your ears, to find yourself in ancient Greece.
[40:22.39]Dracula's defeat was a heavy blow to the Chop Goblins, and you guessed that they now seek the Staff of the Corinthians, a powerful magic weapon from the annals of myth and legend.
[40:35.98]Did I say that wrong?
[40:44.96]I think I did.
[40:49.00]Whatever.
[40:50.62]They cannot be allowed to wield such a weapon.
[40:53.32]You must find it first.
[40:58.22]The mods are having a grand old time over here.
[41:02.48]With various images and where they are put.
[41:05.58]Various blankets and wardrobe.
[41:09.58]They're having a grand old time.
[41:16.13]Alright, they can't be allowed.
[41:17.13]You must find it first and use it against them.
[41:18.95]The big choppers are the ultimate chop goblin warriors.
[41:22.09]Few weapons slow them down and they can destroy your health in seconds.
[41:25.37]Be careful.
[41:29.58]Any new weapons?
[41:36.50]Oh, I like this area.
[41:41.38]It's annals.
[41:42.76]Annals.
[41:43.46]I know.
[41:51.34]I figured that out a tenth of a second after the words came out of my mouth.
[42:15.69]That pistol for a little bit.
[42:18.41]A little slow.
[42:24.03]I can't believe they made this in row.
[42:25.39]Oh, that's still the title.
[42:31.54]Ah, I love this.
[42:37.60]I want one of these.
[42:38.38]You know what I mean?
[42:41.70]I'm never, I'm never going to have one of these, but if I, if you told me to just, okay, dream, dream house.
[42:49.61]I just want like a nice clear cool just little pool not a big one everybody I don't like big pools I just want a little place for me to go sink and just like soak down to my chest and just like ah just for a little bit a shallow little pool like a little no like like a yeah like a hot tub a hot tub that's not just hot water
[43:15.82]I just want to sit in a little, just like this.
[43:18.06]And I want there to be a big plant right here.
[43:19.60]I want there to be like oxygen producing from like cactuses, plants and shit all over here.
[43:24.70]You know what I'm saying?
[43:26.92]And I want this exact lighting too.
[43:30.02]You want a bathtub.
[43:32.90]This is way bigger than a bathtub.
[43:36.32]Let's use the Chopped Goblin as sort of a scale here.
[43:42.35]This is big enough for like five people to sit in.
[43:45.87]And I want it for me.
[43:46.99]I don't want anybody else sitting in this.
[43:48.43]This is for me, not for anybody else.
[43:54.67]This is not a case where like, oh yeah, come over here and piss in my pool.
[43:58.37]No, no, no, no.
[43:58.87]This is for me to sit in here and decompress.
[44:10.97]Holly could use it, too.
[44:11.83]Yeah.
[44:12.43]No, yeah, that's... Oh, no.
[44:13.65]I'm just talking no outside... No other outside people could use it.
[44:20.65]I wouldn't even tell anybody I had it.
[44:22.77]Because you know the first second somebody would be... Oh, my God.
[44:27.81]The second that somebody finds out you have one of those... Oh, sick!
[44:30.81]Oh, cool!
[44:31.33]Yeah!
[44:31.83]And they're taking their shirt off.
[44:34.59]He's like, no, we could, but... Oh, dude, really?
[44:39.21]You got a little pull like that?
[44:41.15]Let's go.
[44:41.65]I'm getting in.
[44:43.81]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:45.21]Don't go in that.
[44:49.23]I don't know.
[44:50.66]Probably a weirdo if you want.
[44:55.64]No, it's all right, man.
[44:56.48]Just dump a bunch of shock in it.
[45:00.67]Sorry, I puked in your nice, pristine pool.
[45:03.61]Nah, just dump shock in here.
[45:05.33]It'll be fine.
[45:06.97]No, what?
[45:08.03]No, I want a clean pool.
[45:09.35]I don't want any fucking puke in my pool.
[45:11.45]I don't want any piss in my pool.
[45:17.08]Sorry, man.
[45:17.68]I accidentally peed and shit in your pool, but it's alright.
[45:21.24]That white powder that you sprinkle in with chemicals, just dump it in there.
[45:26.76]It'll get rid of the puke.
[45:30.39]Dude, you're never coming over again.
[45:41.11]Dude, you got weird friends.
[45:45.51]Why are people doing this in your pool?
[45:49.54]Nobody ever says that!
[45:52.81]Nobody ever says they're doing that.
[45:55.85]But they do.
[45:57.47]And you know what?
[45:58.89]Shame on you.
[46:00.19]Shame on you.
[46:06.34]I wonder, I wonder, I wonder like, you know, oh, like pissing?
[46:09.72]Yeah.
[46:11.26]Shame on you.
[46:16.10]And you can't, here's the thing about a pool.
[46:19.44]There is no verifying anything in a pool a lot of times.
[46:24.12]There is absolutely no verification.
[46:26.96]So, somebody could just be in there pissing, and it's just like, I have no idea, and nobody else does, and no one will ever know.
[46:34.93]There's no verification when somebody goes in a pool.
[46:56.97]Oh, they weren't kidding.
[46:57.55]That actually hurt a lot.
[47:00.62]Oh, I got a huge raid.
[47:05.94]Slimesicle, thanks for the raid.
[47:08.60]Welcome, everybody.
[47:10.92]We're just chilling out, playing some Chop Goblins.
[47:12.90]We played Resident Evil 4 earlier.
[47:14.62]Resident Evil 4 Remake Mercenaries.
[47:16.48]It was fun.
[47:17.74]But thanks, hope you had a good stream.
[47:20.04]We're currently talking about nothing in particular.
[47:25.99]I want a little personal pool, but I'm never going to have it.
[47:28.65]But it's one of the things I would really like to have.
[47:30.93]Nice, nice.
[47:40.45]Alright, I'm going to die.
[47:41.35]I don't think this is a save point.
[47:42.83]I think you just have to beat the level.
[47:44.25]Alright, can I knock it in here?
[48:03.31]Yeah, we're just chilling.
[48:06.23]Appreciate it though.
[48:18.17]I love that if somebody were to ask me what is your favorite thing in the world and it's we're not talking about like any what's your favorite thing like what's your favorite food is different like obviously like in the world I know but like this right here this how this looks is one of my top 50 favorite things in the world
[48:44.46]Just like bright blue, clean, clear water in a box.
[48:51.32]It's really high up there.
[48:56.30]I know a lot of you get it.
[49:03.25]Any type of large square or circle container with nice, pristine blue water in it.
[49:14.05]What about an aquarium?
[49:17.21]Yeah.
[49:17.90]Secret door.
[49:19.58]Maybe it's this one.
[49:26.56]Really?
[49:36.52]I like that sound too.
[49:41.90]That kind of like bubbling water.
[49:44.99]Even just saying bubbling water.
[49:50.21]There it is.
[49:50.55]There's my favorite thing in the world right here.
[49:55.76]All right, I need to stop.
[50:05.12]Get out of my pool.
[50:05.84]That's my pool.
[50:07.62]He's going to go piss in that pool in front of me.
[50:15.44]Oh shit, okay, I actually have to be a gamer now.
[50:25.31]He died in the pool.
[50:29.93]Okay, you know those shows where they um... They kind of redo your whole house.
[50:43.42]And after a week, you come back and you have like a blindfold on and you take it off in the living room and it's like, oh my goodness, look at all this.
[50:50.44]It doesn't matter what my house or what my apartment, whatever it looked like before, just in the middle of the living room, just make a nice pristine blue square chest high pool.
[51:03.81]And I'm going to cry.
[51:04.59]I'm going to do this.
[51:05.15]I'm going to be like, you can't even.
[51:09.83]Look what they put in.
[51:10.63]They put the pool.
[51:11.29]They did what I liked.
[51:14.00]I would cry.
[51:18.00]And there could be rotten wood all over here and I wouldn't matter as long as I was there.
[51:31.93]All right, this game just got, this game just got a little harder.
[51:41.71]Good.
[51:44.82]I don't have any ammo.
[51:45.40]I need to get ammo with this gun equipped.
[51:47.96]Thank you.
[51:54.26]Those guys hurt a lot.
[51:55.10]I should probably parry.
[52:03.07]Can I parry those?
[52:03.55]Are they too big?
[52:05.63]Maybe if I actually did it.
[52:06.53]Oh, thank goodness.
[52:21.91]Yeah, but the water has to be faintly lit with like a light blue, like kind of slightly teal light.
[52:33.90]And the Twinsons Odyssey soundtrack has to play in the background.
[52:56.83]I just pull him in here.
[53:00.04]Why look it up?
[53:04.70]Look up that soundtrack and you tell me why.
[53:15.95]Just play that game on stream.
[53:28.15]Nice.
[53:43.82]You should play every game of existence on Steam.
[53:46.18]I don't think... Princess Odyssey is on Steam.
[53:50.03]Is it?
[53:51.89]It's the sequel to Little Big Adventure.
[53:53.79]Little Big Adventure 2.
[53:57.88]It's on steam.
[54:00.84]What?
[54:01.88]How did I not know that?
[54:05.43]That's like in my top.
[54:06.77]That's probably my top 20 favorite games ever made.
[54:19.29]It's on steam, buddy.
[54:20.41]Ooh.
[54:21.43]Okay.
[54:21.83]Add that to the list.
[54:27.14]Hello, Twinson.
[54:29.76]Greetings, Mr. Twinson.
[54:31.48]Have I done this?
[54:32.62]I feel like I've played this on... No, maybe not.
[54:34.56]Maybe not.
[54:38.24]Those of you that know, you know.
[54:41.34]About that game.
[54:42.10]But I don't know.
[54:43.12]Maybe not.
[54:45.84]Maybe I thought about wanting to do it years ago and I just never did it.
[54:48.20]There's a remaster of the two games coming up and LBA 3 has been announced.
[54:57.48]You're gonna make me cry.
[55:01.00]Do not put the LBA 2 soundtrack on in my pool and tell me that there is a sequel coming out while I soak in this.
[55:25.13]Dead?
[55:27.80]I think so.
[55:35.46]I don't know who did the voice acting in that game.
[55:38.96]But it is unironically, and I mean this.
[55:42.04]I mean this 100% truthfully.
[55:45.51]That game has some of the best voice acting of any game I've ever played.
[55:52.45]Get those coins.
[55:55.99]I will.
[56:00.05]I think it's less than a few people even doing the voice work.
[56:03.38]And they do dozens of characters.
[56:05.04]And they're so good.
[56:07.76]There's so much life and so much energy and so much passion in that voice work.
[56:13.38]Trust me when I tell you.
[56:14.64]It's phenomenal.
[56:17.22]The characters that people do.
[56:19.78]The elephant voices.
[56:20.64]Oh my goodness.
[56:21.24]You're going to make me cry.
[56:23.50]Alright.
[56:24.14]I didn't get the coins.
[56:26.16]Why are you walking in circles?
[56:27.18]Uh.
[56:30.45]Oh, right.
[56:31.25]Should we should we tell?
[56:32.11]All right, let's tell them.
[56:33.97]When I get on a topic, I will just walk in a circle and just forget that I'm playing a video game and just it's probably annoying.
[56:38.89]I'm sorry.
[56:40.03]I've been doing this for like 12 years.
[56:43.91]Has there ever been a time when I've played a game and didn't just like absentmindedly go on autopilot in a circle while I was talking?
[56:51.82]No, it's never happened.
[57:00.47]Oh, nice.
[57:09.45]You don't have a multitasking talent.
[57:12.71]You know, I can carry a lot of things at the same time.
[57:14.83]I don't know if that counts.
[57:18.52]But you bet your ass I'm getting the entire grocery run in one go.
[57:21.70]Does that count?
[57:32.85]That's multitasking.
[57:33.59]You got one on your pinky hanging.
[57:35.53]One on your thumb.
[57:37.49]One sort of wrapped around your left hand.
[57:39.91]One gripped.
[57:40.79]You have it bunched up tight.
[57:43.13]You take the two ends and you bunch it up tight.
[57:45.27]You got like ten bags in your hand.
[57:50.29]That's just a... That's not a multitask.
[57:53.41]Oh, can you sing while you do it too?
[57:54.93]Okay.
[57:55.90]Back off.
[57:59.34]What's the point of this room?
[58:09.05]It's the build the wall, break the wall, rebuild the wall in Minecraft, as you've called it before.
[58:18.10]Is there anything I missed in here?
[58:30.15]Several doors have opened, apparently.
[58:32.99]Wait.
[58:34.17]Here we go.
[58:52.57]I think I just like natural shit.
[58:57.89]Remember I told you one of my favorite things is the sticky kind of gooey lava where it's charcoal looking and then they hit it with that little stick and it opens up and it's like lava.
[59:11.38]I want a room like this too in my house.
[59:15.79]It's like jello.
[59:17.85]It's a weird thick jello lava.
[59:21.25]Dude wants a lava pit in his room.
[59:36.74]Yeah, that like rolling thick sludge.
[59:42.04]It's really thick.
[59:44.99]I should have been like a scientist.
[59:46.51]Like a biologist.
[59:47.71]I don't know.
[59:48.03]I should have gone into something to do with that.
[59:49.75]There's still time.
[59:53.18]There's still time.
[59:58.00]I hope this doesn't kill me instantly.
[60:13.52]I'm afraid.
[60:15.59]Oh my god.
[60:20.73]Oh my god, how do I get up?
[60:25.33]There we go.
[60:27.95]I should be a geologist.
[60:37.28]There's a lot of cool things to do.
[60:46.52]I mean, I could always just wear like a fisherman's cap and have sunscreen all over my nose, have like a bowling shirt on with a camera around my neck and a fanny pack, and have my wrists, both of them, planted on my back walking around and following the other scientists, going like, wow, look at that!
[61:05.05]Ooh, wow!
[61:07.01]Oh, can I get a picture of that?
[61:10.23]I can just go on vacation.
[61:14.98]Right?
[61:15.52]I can just go on vacation and just... I don't have to like... Bro's talking about his 40th birthday.
[61:24.68]That's what I'm saying, yeah.
[61:27.32]Just be a geologist orbiter.
[61:32.69]Oh, this is actually bad.
[61:33.91]Hold on.
[61:34.29]I gotta pay attention here.
[61:56.15]Okay, that was hard.
[62:14.50]Just checking in.
[62:15.12]How's your health going?
[62:17.14]It's going alright.
[62:19.04]It's going good.
[62:20.91]I would tell you if there was any major changes or anything.
[62:27.97]I think another big part of this year, too, where I kind of told you guys about slowing down a little bit.
[62:34.58]There's a lot that goes into that.
[62:37.30]So, the wand is stored in this temple.
[62:39.88]The correct symbols must be nearby.
[62:41.48]Huh?
[63:04.67]Symbols are nearby?
[63:05.51]Shit.
[63:20.64]Nearby.
[63:26.97]Was anybody paying attention to symbols?
[63:28.17]Because I wasn't.
[63:47.81]Ooh, okay.
[63:50.25]Triangle.
[63:58.93]It's a circle with two legs.
[64:03.52]What's his name?
[64:04.38]Q-Bert.
[64:13.08]And then M this way, E that way.
[64:18.77]W the other way.
[64:29.51]Oh, there it is.
[64:37.28]Toilet seat.
[64:40.28]That looks like what I need.
[64:44.54]How's Joel doing?
[64:45.20]I hope Joel's doing good.
[64:54.32]Okay, well, I just used one of ten.
[64:57.36]I just used ten percent of this thing's power, which was a stupid idea because I probably have to.
[65:01.60]All right, don't use it again.
[65:06.75]All right.
[65:19.76]Where to?
[65:30.80]My neighbor got a new car today and he's been standing outside staring at it while eating chips for 15 minutes.
[65:34.92]I get that.
[65:43.62]I get that.
[66:06.14]Again you find yourself in a whirlwind of colors.
[66:08.76]The last thing you heard was the familiar sound the Aztec time manipulation tablet activating.
[66:14.68]This must be their final dreadful bid for victory.
[66:17.73]You emerge in a desolate wasteland, a future that is not what could be.
[66:23.35]They've transported you to an alternate timeline.
[66:26.89]A grimy sci-fi dystopia where the Chop Goblins already won.
[66:31.08]You stand in their vile capital city, Chopping Grad.
[66:35.20]Surrounded by the ruins of human civilization in front of a strange industrial structure, it must be their HQ.
[66:42.52]You grip the staff of the Corinthians with rage.
[66:45.62]A world overrun by Chop Goblins just means more Chop Goblins to shoot.
[66:50.52]It's time for the final battle.
[66:53.77]The hack goblinators are part goblin, part machine.
[66:57.94]They have transcended the bounds of flesh and are faster and more cunning than the other chop goblins, relentlessly flanking their foes and attacking with deadly laser cleavers.
[67:09.51]Hmm.
[67:14.49]Okay.
[67:16.01]Final level, I think.
[67:22.85]So I only have six more shots with this.
[67:24.31]I don't think I'm going to use it till the very end.
[67:26.19]This is my Resident Evil rocket launcher.
[67:27.55]Whoa, okay, they're already... I gotta learn... The reflect is so powerful, probably.
[67:37.50]Maybe I can't.
[67:49.45]I love this music.
[68:06.84]Play Lifeline again?
[68:09.50]No.
[68:12.58]No way.
[68:17.12]I think I'm just sealed.
[68:17.96]That's getting sealed.
[68:20.60]Permanently.
[68:22.56]Didn't I beat it?
[68:23.32]I beat that game already, didn't I?
[68:29.02]Or did I just pretend that I did in my brain so I don't ever play it again?
[68:32.58]Yeah, I beat it.
[68:34.96]The game was hell.
[68:37.28]That old PS2 mic was so bad.
[68:39.60]Yeah, I remember the very end, the last battle was that huge robotic monster thing, right?
[68:46.37]I can't believe I actually beat that game.
[68:59.66]Uh, where do I go?
[69:13.16]Oh, that's cool.
[69:14.08]Like a motherboard building.
[69:21.07]Did I miss something?
[69:32.16]Hmm.
[69:46.42]Where's the... Where's game progress?
[69:53.20]The lever I didn't pull?
[69:54.23]Hmm.
[70:04.72]Why did I do that?
[70:08.72]You beat it.
[70:09.98]I don't think I did.
[70:10.94]It's to your left?
[70:21.53]Did you play Seaman again?
[70:22.51]No.
[70:26.88]You guys have to understand the reason why the... Oh.
[70:30.95]The re... Hold on.
[70:35.61]The reason why those games were some of the longest streams I've ever done is because I didn't want to turn those games on ever again.
[70:40.65]Because I know if I turned the Dreamcast off, that game would never be opened again.
[70:46.75]So I had to stick with it because that was the only time you were ever going to see that.
[70:50.35]So it had to be like a 13 hour, 14 hour stream.
[71:03.02]Same thing with the Lord of the Rings games.
[71:05.12]Those old Lord of the Rings games were so hard and just so crazy and so frustrating.
[71:10.48]There's no way I was going to open them again.
[71:15.41]And you know that if I didn't beat those games in one day, you guys would, a week would go by.
[71:24.03]Hey, dude, that Lord of the Rings stream was really, really fun and really funny.
[71:28.15]Are you going to ever finish it?
[71:30.97]Yeah, yeah.
[71:31.73]I don't know.
[71:33.41]Maybe some point soon.
[71:35.73]A year will go by and this never happens.
[71:37.39]Hey, ammo.
[71:58.30]Wait, Chris is dead.
[72:00.62]What about Pajama Sam?
[72:05.28]I mean... There's a lot of games to play.
[72:10.69]Do I really want to play them for more than a few hours?
[72:13.03]Oh my goodness, that scared me.
[72:32.65]There is somebody behind me.
[72:33.55]I knew it.
[72:33.99]I'm dead.
[72:34.43]I need health right now.
[72:43.72]Nice.
[72:46.82]I guess I could use this.
[72:47.64]I'm going to use it.
[72:51.80]Whatever.
[72:52.04]This is a tough room.
[72:58.50]Ugh.
[73:02.86]Sad.
[73:08.47]Sad.
[73:11.45]Alright, well now I know where to go.
[73:12.51]Hey, there's a difficulty after this too.
[73:27.08]For all you gamers out there.
[73:33.76]You wash your hands like two hours ago.
[73:47.67]Will you at least go back to Yakuza ever again?
[73:51.30]I know.
[73:53.88]I think Yakuza actually could probably see a pretty major return.
[74:03.80]Especially with more streams like this.
[74:05.62]Just kind of pick something and just jump in it.
[74:13.29]Play it.
[74:13.57]Not even think about it.
[74:14.91]Let me make sure I'm at full health.
[74:25.34]I don't want to be topped off.
[74:26.32]There we go.
[74:35.35]Play it tonight.
[74:42.06]I really thought this is Roblox.
[74:43.78]Maybe we should change the title.
[74:50.78]Now, this is by the Dusk Dev.
[74:54.39]David, what's... I wonder how you pronounce David's last name.
[75:05.86]I just lost 40 health.
[75:14.73]Iron Lung.
[75:15.67]I loved Iron Lung.
[75:42.46]Can you please play Roblox?
[75:43.48]We've been chatting on your world.
[75:45.44]I don't have a world.
[75:56.47]How do I have a world?
[75:57.13]I don't even know it.
[75:57.67]Okay, well, that's what you have to do.
[76:06.62]You gotta use that wand.
[76:09.94]Because everybody is deadly in here.
[76:18.04]Did I get them all?
[76:26.36]Uh-oh.
[76:29.18]Okay.
[76:30.56]Give me something good in here.
[76:31.32]Uh-oh.
[76:41.27]Another big guy?
[76:45.63]Cool.
[76:47.11]Oh man, first person shooter.
[77:13.81]Roblox or leave?
[77:16.43]Well, you're talking about you.
[77:19.26]Not me.
[77:30.27]Is it?
[77:30.55]I think...
[77:38.32]the fuck what what do you mean what the fuck these they're evil robot chop goblins they're destroying earth if I get points for this guy then you guys are wrong I did
[78:08.54]They're just trying to work.
[78:09.40]Uh... Detonating bombs and explosive electrical destruction rays across Earth?
[78:17.03]Yes, that's what they're doing at their job.
[78:19.39]Right.
[78:20.69]Should I let them continue?
[78:33.93]They were actively dropping like EMP electricity bombs all across the world.
[78:40.59]Alright, this room sucks.
[79:07.58]You got everybody?
[79:12.88]I think I got everybody.
[79:16.06]Hey, Germa.
[79:17.54]Ligma?
[79:19.02]What's that?
[79:21.67]Ligma.
[79:22.85]What's that?
[79:44.95]Where should I go?
[79:53.29]Did I go this way?
[79:54.03]Yeah, I did.
[79:54.64]I already went this way.
[80:06.14]This is like way back.
[80:11.31]What about Breath of the Wild?
[80:13.48]I'll go back to that.
[80:14.16]Oh, okay.
[80:16.54]I can go up here.
[80:19.02]I just didn't keep going, did I?
[80:22.19]I'll play more Breath of the Wild at some point.
[80:23.53]I don't know, on your birthday or something.
[80:27.59]No, I'm kidding.
[80:28.19]I'll play it probably like a week.
[80:31.76]How do I turn this off?
[80:40.01]It has to be in this room, right?
[80:42.59]Through the computer?
[80:43.29]There's no switch in here?
[80:51.40]There has to be a switch in here to turn that off.
[80:56.24]When are you going to play my game?
[81:05.11]What's your game?
[81:17.11]Breath of the Wild.
[81:17.95]You didn't make Breath of the Wild.
[81:21.96]I'm gonna get the ammo down here, but I don't know where to go.
[81:23.92]Yeah, I made Breath of the Wild.
[81:34.19]This is kind of like a server room, but there's nothing in here.
[81:46.11]This is a switch somewhere.
[81:47.37]I just haven't found it.
[81:49.29]Hey!
[81:50.83]Okay, there it is.
[81:51.61]There we go.
[82:04.34]Oh, shit.
[82:06.42]Um... What do I do now?
[82:19.39]Up the ledge?
[82:20.51]I don't think I can.
[82:21.17]Yeah, there's no jump.
[82:23.21]Maybe if I run fast enough, I'll make it?
[82:27.91]Can I walk on the edge?
[82:31.69]No.
[82:31.89]Uh-oh.
[82:34.61]Thank god.
[82:40.27]This is a tricky jump with no jump button.
[82:47.55]Alright.
[82:48.46]There we go.
[82:48.86]Just don't die out here.
[82:52.74]Look at all this.
[82:53.78]Alright, I'm... I'm... This is gonna be... Jeez.
[83:20.62]Yep.
[83:22.82]Whoa, big guy.
[83:23.92]Need more.
[83:28.76]I don't want to use all this shit.
[83:36.18]I need to save it for the big guys.
[83:38.38]Like you.
[83:40.77]Okay.
[83:50.25]Nice.
[83:52.85]Is he alive?
[83:53.95]Oh.
[83:54.39]Oh my goodness.
[83:56.27]Good.
[84:20.59]Wait, help.
[84:25.81]This is the Star Wars lightning all over again.
[84:34.02]Oh, I like this.
[84:36.36]This is cool looking.
[84:40.52]Zordon?
[84:47.43]Destroy the cyber goblin to set things right.
[85:01.72]You emerge gasping from the time portal, back in the museum basement.
[85:05.92]Your own time, just as you'd left it.
[85:08.58]But what of the Chop Goblins?
[85:10.58]You glance frantically out the window.
[85:12.48]The city streets are miraculously undestroyed and unchopped.
[85:15.62]The nightmare is over.
[85:17.66]Then your eye catches something in the corner.
[85:19.04]The dusty old chest that had imprisoned the Chop Goblins is still there and still open.
[85:24.44]The Chop Goblins are still out there somehow, waiting for the opportunity to chop again.
[85:28.39]Oh.
[85:32.16]Come on, Vinny!
[85:34.64]You beat me by fucking 2000 points?
[85:47.21]That's funny.
[85:48.47]Loser POV.
[85:59.44]It's like once again mode to start a new game with the same weapons.
[86:02.95]Oh, okay.
[86:05.07]Once again.
[86:05.53]Cool.
[86:09.03]Very cool.
[86:16.70]Vinny beat you because he played DMC5.
[86:20.76]Hmm.
[86:23.40]I'll have to be a good gamer and check it out.
[86:31.52]Oh, I'm curious.
[86:32.04]I just want to see how hard it is on the hardest difficulty.
[86:44.35]How much harder is it?
[86:46.81]Is it really?
[86:47.45]Okay.
[86:52.07]Seems like it is.
[86:52.55]They're a lot faster, I feel like.
[87:11.49]And I... Devil May Cry, I've never played it.
[87:13.85]Not even for one second.
[87:16.17]I've only seen trailer gameplay footage from like Nintendo Directs and E3s.
[87:27.44]All I've seen is announcement footage of Devil May Cry.
[87:31.87]That's it.
[87:34.45]Sad secret.
[87:37.95]would I actually like that game and I know people are gonna go yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there are like five or six of them I have the same issue with god of war it's like oh god of war one god of war two god of war three god of war new god of war god of war new god of war two god of war no don't play god of war two play god of war three play two and then skip five and
[88:04.07]I don't know.
[88:05.29]Where do I start?
[88:06.44]What should I actually do?
[88:08.28]Just do 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
[88:11.86]No, do 1, 3, 4, and 5.
[88:13.66]Skip 2.
[88:14.98]And skip the reboot, is what I'm being told.
[88:16.90]I feel like a fake fan if I skip games, though.
[88:23.51]Well, I'm not even a fan anyways, so who cares?
[88:26.43]I guess that's true.
[88:35.80]True fans actually skipped two.
[88:38.44]All right.
[88:39.18]Okay, I hear you.
[88:42.14]Two is unbelievably bad.
[88:44.40]What happened?
[88:45.10]Why?
[88:47.30]And if two was so unbelievably bad, then how did they pull it together so well to have three be so good?
[88:53.54]What happened?
[89:01.95]It's complicated.
[89:02.91]Okay.
[89:11.05]That was fun.
[89:13.01]That was a really fun game.
[89:16.56]I like the chop goblins.
[89:21.16]How much even is this on Steam right now?
[89:30.13]I think this is like a couple of dollars or something, isn't it?
[89:36.89]Five bucks.
[89:40.11]$5.
[89:40.15]Worth it.
[89:41.87]It was great.
[89:43.37]And you can get the soundtrack if you get the Chop Goblins Game of the Week bundle for $5.93.
[89:48.43]That was awesome.
[89:55.87]I had this on the list and I was just like, I gotta find a day where I could, because I knew it was only going to be like an hour and a half or so, an hour or two hours.
[90:07.20]End of the stream?
[90:07.72]Um...
[90:15.43]Maybe we'll do... How does one run of Isaac sound?
[90:22.05]I think that sounds good.
[90:28.13]We'll do an Isaac run.
[90:33.89]Let me just go pee one more time.
[90:45.12]Be right back.
