[00:00.45]Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 1 of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[00:08.15]This is going to be a single-player Let's Play, and when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[00:17.03]You're going to see lots of fails, you're going to see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping.
[00:21.49]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa.
[00:25.07]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[00:27.10]Let me take a sip.
[00:29.51]Ah, that's a good sight.
[00:32.37]Alright, so let's get this started.
[00:34.79]Create new world.
[00:36.99]World name is going to be... JermaCraft.
[00:42.53]Sounds about right.
[00:43.19]Yeah, okay.
[00:44.67]Game mode is going to be Survival.
[00:47.57]That's the most interesting, I think.
[00:49.71]More world options.
[00:50.85]Seed for world generator.
[00:51.99]Okay, this is important.
[00:53.73]I've got to name this something crazy to get cool structures and stuff.
[00:59.04]gonna name it um how about diamonds are forever LOL cheese uh burger alright that's that's our world generator seed diamonds are forever LOL cheese burger done alright let's see what happens create a new world let's do it guys
[01:27.81]Building terrain, oh my god, this is so exciting, this is episode one!
[01:31.71]I wonder where we're going to end up.
[01:35.04]Where are we going to end up?
[01:37.32]Okay.
[01:39.46]What?
[01:39.92]What?
[01:42.18]Where the hell am I?
[01:44.56]I spawned on top of a mountaintop.
[01:46.89]Okay, hold on, sound has to be lowered, definitely.
[01:51.05]Okay, lower that, lower that.
[01:53.13]Maybe a little lower.
[01:55.09]That sounds about right.
[02:00.03]Alright, so apparently I spawned on top of a mountain.
[02:06.30]This is a good seed.
[02:07.28]What's that?
[02:08.46]We're going to explore it right now.
[02:09.56]Go!
[02:10.90]Alright, we're going to try that again.
[02:16.13]This time I'm not going to miss.
[02:18.63]I want to get down to that.
[02:19.37]That's the home right there.
[02:20.43]I want to live right there.
[02:22.27]I don't even have to explore.
[02:23.23]Let's see if I can't do this.
[02:25.32]Hold on.
[02:25.74]I got an idea.
[02:26.30]I got a plan.
[02:27.71]JermaCraft, episode one.
[02:29.43]This is how we do it.
[02:32.33]You guys ready?
[02:33.91]I don't know if you guys are actually really ready for this.
[02:37.60]Here we go.
[02:38.06]I'm going for a skydive.
[02:43.46]Remember, if you hold shift, you don't fall off.
[02:46.16]That's something I didn't know when I used to livestream this game.
[02:50.88]Are you guys ready?
[02:52.44]Ready to go see our new home?
[02:58.00]Alrighty then.
[02:59.98]What the hell's that?
[03:00.60]Oh, it's an octopus.
[03:02.88]Look at this little quaint little place.
[03:06.88]I love it already.
[03:11.90]Alrighty.
[03:12.38]Oh, I'm so stupid.
[03:16.50]You see, this is why I'm an idiot, guys.
[03:19.70]You see, why would I... I need to get wood.
[03:23.29]And I just jumped off the... Okay, remember this.
[03:27.53]Where are we?
[03:28.05]Pointing east?
[03:28.85]I have no idea.
[03:30.03]Gotta get some trees.
[03:32.53]That's the most important part about Minecraft, you gotta get trees.
[03:35.71]That's the first thing you gotta get.
[03:37.51]Let me take a sip of my apple cider.
[03:41.25]Oh, that's good stuff.
[03:43.63]Hopefully you guys picked up a thing of cocoa like I told you to, because that's the most relaxing thing in the world, sitting down, playing video games.
[03:52.44]Doesn't get much better than that.
[03:55.58]Okay, come on now.
[03:58.38]Ooh, we got sand, too.
[04:00.58]Now, explain this to me, alright?
[04:02.38]Alright, I want Notch to send me a personal email and explain to me why there are cows that are acting like mountain lions.
[04:10.60]I'm gonna kill each one of those cows in just a minute.
[04:13.18]You watch.
[04:15.80]Ow.
[04:17.44]Well, at least there's one tree over here.
[04:20.24]I gotta remember, I gotta go back that way, because that's where the house is gonna be.
[04:25.37]My awesome dirt house.
[04:28.19]So if you are an old subscriber, I mean really old, like at least four months, four or five months, you'll remember the original JermaCraft.
[04:36.98]It was like two episodes.
[04:39.24]And I built a dirt house.
[04:41.84]This is going to be completely different.
[04:43.06]I'm going to actually spend time and make some cool stuff.
[04:48.10]At least that's what I'm pretending that I'm going to say that.
[04:51.47]Got some wood.
[04:52.63]Oh, I got Geno still from Mario RPG, one of the best games of all time.
[04:57.03]If you have never played Mario RPG, I suggest you play it.
[05:01.25]Alright, got some wood.
[05:02.03]Any more trees over here I can dig up?
[05:06.00]I'll get this one too.
[05:10.08]One more and we'll make our way back.
[05:15.28]So I guess they added a hunger feature now too.
[05:17.39]If you're hungry, you die or something, I guess.
[05:22.15]Who knows?
[05:22.73]A little bit more wood.
[05:28.53]And in my live streams, it was always a tradition that when I played this game, I would sing a song when things got really boring.
[05:35.89]So that seems like the perfect opportunity right now to sing a song.
[05:39.57]So let me just prep my vocal cords for a second.
[05:44.07]Okay.
[05:45.45]So we're getting wood right now, right?
[05:48.20]Do-do-do-do.
[05:49.74]We're chopping wood down Every single day I gotta get my tools Any which way I can't seem to reach this stupid piece of wood So I gotta put some blocks down to get where I should I'm gonna chop
[06:17.92]I'm gonna chop right now.
[06:19.18]Alright, that's enough.
[06:24.50]Got it.
[06:25.70]Let's get the hell out of here.
[06:28.66]Yay!
[06:29.18]So those of you that don't think that's gonna be a good spot, you'll see.
[06:35.56]I'm going to build that up to be like a castle.
[06:38.64]So here's the goal.
[06:39.76]By Christmas time of this year, 2011, I want to have a giant castle like as big as that mountain over there.
[06:50.10]So let's clean this up a little bit.
[06:52.08]Why don't we, huh?
[06:54.68]Alright, alright.
[06:56.53]Maybe put a little bit of dirt down here.
[06:59.13]Make sure I can, you know... Did I really run out of dirt?
[07:04.37]Wonderful.
[07:05.53]My first wooden tools is just like going to your first day of school and getting punched in the face by the bully.
[07:16.21]Speaking of bullies, I got a funny story for you.
[07:20.85]First ever story on JermaCraft while I do this mundane stuff.
[07:27.29]So when I was in like the fourth grade, there was a kid that lived down the street from me.
[07:33.14]His name will stay anonymous because, you know, I don't want him to like, if he watches these videos, I don't want him to come like beat me up.
[07:40.80]Not that he would ever remember this to begin with.
[07:43.32]But I was probably like the fourth grade.
[07:45.49]And I was a little, I was a little S-word, guys.
[07:48.89]I was a little, I was a little, little jerk when I was younger.
[07:53.31]So essentially what happened was this kid, he was a big, big fat kid.
[07:58.23]Scary, not very nice.
[08:01.63]And my brother got in a fight with him a long time before this.
[08:05.51]When I was in the second grade, my brother's a little bit older than me.
[08:08.59]And let me pick this up.
[08:10.05]So my brother got in a fight with this kid, and I heard about it.
[08:13.85]And so at the bus stop one day, because we were at the same bus stop because he lives right down the street from us.
[08:18.99]At least he did.
[08:19.55]I don't know if he does anymore.
[08:21.49]So I don't know why.
[08:22.97]I was in the fourth grade.
[08:23.91]This is how much of a little jerk I was.
[08:26.05]So my grandmother used to pick me up from school after I got from the bus stop.
[08:29.51]Because, you know, obviously you don't want to walk, you know, the mile and a half back to your house or whatever it is.
[08:33.46]Because the bus stop wasn't that close.
[08:36.22]So my grandma used to pick me up and he was at the bus stop as well.
[08:39.86]And one day I decided that out of the back window...
[08:43.71]I was going to give him a double middle finger as I was driving away with my grandmother one day.
[08:49.36]I don't even know why I did it, guys.
[08:51.24]I can't tell you one reason why I gave this kid the double middle finger.
[08:57.39]And from that day forward, he just kind of gave me a weird look like, what the hell are you doing?
[09:03.21]And from that day forward, I would run, run as fast as I could to the bus stop and away to the bus stop to where my grandmother was going to pick me up.
[09:11.45]And it was like that for almost six months.
[09:13.96]And he never beat me up or anything like that.
[09:16.26]I was like overreacting.
[09:19.96]Actually, hold on a second.
[09:20.94]I don't need this.
[09:22.38]What am I doing with this?
[09:24.08]I was just putting blocks down.
[09:26.00]Actually, no, no, no.
[09:26.60]I was doing the right thing.
[09:27.65]I want these.
[09:28.83]Because I want to make like a wall kind of.
[09:30.43]Let's keep that going.
[09:33.89]So, yeah.
[09:34.69]So, I guess the moral of that story is never give the double middle finger to a bully.
[09:39.85]Because you'll be scared for the rest of your life.
[09:42.50]And I still am scared.
[09:43.52]When I, like, open my door to, like, go get, like, groceries, I'm scared that bully's gonna come get me from me giving him the bird.
[09:51.94]Yeah, that is actually a true story.
[09:53.34]I did not make that up.
[09:55.26]I was scared for, like, at least six months.
[09:57.67]And nothing ever happened, either.
[09:58.83]And I didn't get beat up or anything, so.
[10:02.59]Alright, now.
[10:04.67]Is this all... Is this just gonna go straight down into... Okay, cool.
[10:09.27]Cool!
[10:11.61]I'm gonna make a little mine here.
[10:14.01]It's getting late.
[10:15.25]It's getting late, and when it gets late, that's when Jerma starts to lose.
[10:19.76]I don't think I've ever made it past one night in this game when people are watching.
[10:25.64]I really don't think it's happened.
[10:28.92]Is that... Oh, there's a mine somewhere around here.
[10:32.33]Pretty sick!
[10:34.87]Oh, gee, it's right here.
[10:37.09]Oh, nice.
[10:39.19]Maybe there's coal right here, too.
[10:40.43]That would be pretty awesome.
[10:43.09]Oh, my God.
[10:43.92]Creeper.
[10:45.28]Creeper, get the hell out of here.
[10:47.40]I'm going to kick your butt.
[10:49.96]No, you're going to blow up.
[10:51.84]Go on.
[10:52.90]Go on.
[10:53.20]What do you think I care?
[10:54.98]You can't hurt me.
[10:55.58]I've got a shovel.
[10:56.14]I'm going to shovel your face in.
[10:59.86]Okay, well, that's done.
[11:03.37]There's not coal just right here somewhere.
[11:04.99]There has to be.
[11:05.57]See, this is why they always tell you, right when you start, you need to go get coal and you need to go get wood and everything, but I was too busy talking about a bully and me giving him the middle finger.
[11:15.65]So I'm trying to see if I can see coal.
[11:17.73]Sometimes it's just right on the edge of these mountains.
[11:21.59]Hmm.
[11:23.49]I am not pleased.
[11:26.69]Let's at least do this.
[11:30.20]I need a sheep, too.
[11:31.02]I need wool.
[11:33.35]being a real piece of crap.
