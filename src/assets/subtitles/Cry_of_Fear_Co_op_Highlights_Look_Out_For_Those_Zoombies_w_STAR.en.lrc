[00:08.31]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:09.83]Jerma here with Scare Saturdays.
[00:12.97]This time on Scare Saturdays, gonna be going through some of the co-op of Cry of Fear with Star.
[00:18.99]Now, before anybody asks any questions, this is not going to be a full Let's Play of Cry of Fear.
[00:27.11]As much as that would be cool, I would probably rather stream something like that than to upload like 50 episodes of this onto my YouTube channel.
[00:35.35]but it's about a 15 minute video, condensed kind of highlight reel of some of the scares, some of the funny things that happened, some of the happenings we came across, and that's probably what you're gonna get.
[00:45.18]Like I said, I don't want to have a huge Let's Play on this channel that's like, you know, 50 episodes long.
[00:49.83]I've gone down that path before, as a lot of you guys know, I've done some Let's Plays, and yeah, we're on episode 6, I'm done.
[00:57.13]But with that said,
[00:58.91]Here is the video, guys.
[00:59.88]Not gonna take up any more time.
[01:01.12]I wanna get to the content, obviously.
[01:02.72]So, it's been sunny out.
[01:04.86]Go outside and go get some sunbathing, because I'm about to do it right now, baby.
[01:08.22]Sunbathing!
[01:09.38]I'm gonna turn up... No, don't turn... Ooh, there's a gun.
[01:11.20]There's my gun.
[01:12.81]I can't pick up that gun.
[01:13.73]I got the G430 semi-auto.
[01:15.61]I cannot pick up that gun.
[01:16.25]I don't know how to equip it.
[01:17.27]There's a guy.
[01:17.69]There's a guy.
[01:18.01]There's a guy.
[01:18.29]There's a guy over there.
[01:18.83]Where's their guy?
[01:19.31]I don't hear a guy.
[01:19.81]Over here.
[01:20.23]He's, like, shifting around like a freak show.
[01:22.73]Don't shoot him!
[01:23.55]Don't shoot him!
[01:24.21]What do you mean, don't shoot him?
[01:25.23]This is a frickin' neighborhood!
[01:29.75]What did you do?
[01:31.09]Do I have no bullets left?
[01:32.71]I shot him.
[01:33.19]Dude, there's such recoil on this gun, it's unbelievable.
[01:36.89]Help me, help me.
[01:38.01]Don't shoot this guy.
[01:42.39]Shoot him, please.
[01:43.57]You do it.
[01:46.11]I have to change my sensitivity.
[01:47.51]I can't aim like this.
[01:48.64]And I gotta figure out how to equip the G43 semi-auto.
[01:51.64]Give me a sec.
[01:52.22]I'm gonna hide in this dark corner.
[01:53.90]I'll cover you.
[01:54.38]If I die, this is all on you.
[01:56.68]Alright, I will cover you.
[01:59.31]Are you ready now, for real?
[02:00.51]Okay, this game is really laggy.
[02:01.99]It is, like, locked at 30 FPS, you're not joking.
[02:04.76]Alright, well, you have to go first.
[02:05.52]There's a guy!
[02:06.28]There's a guy!
[02:06.94]You have the gun.
[02:07.86]You- I have a gun too, but I can't shoot this guy.
[02:10.98]I just shot him in the balls.
[02:13.08]These things have- What is that?!
[02:14.88]What do you mean, what is what?
[02:15.50]It's an upside-down flying mattress!
[02:17.98]What?
[02:18.24]Where?
[02:19.18]You don't s- Okay, you walk down there.
[02:23.17]Okay, I do see it!
[02:26.75]What is her- Is it dead?
[02:31.07]I don't have any bullets left, by the way.
[02:33.01]Yeah, that's kind of happening.
[02:34.07]We should, um... I think in our inventory we have a nightstick.
[02:38.91]I don't know how to equip these into slots.
[02:41.05]Oh, you just click them and click... Yeah, I just did that.
[02:43.53]If you click them, you can bring them over to slot one.
[02:45.73]Slot one is one, slot two is two, slot three is three.
[02:47.97]Okay, I got this.
[02:50.28]Alright, I don't have any bullets.
[02:52.72]So... Something's gonna jump up.
[02:56.46]Wait, did I just get bullets?
[02:58.46]I did, didn't I?
[02:59.40]No, I didn't.
[02:59.84]That was you reloading, I think.
[03:10.15]Get out of here.
[03:15.57]What?
[03:19.01]Game over?
[03:19.73]I'm so scared.
[03:27.22]Good idea.
[03:30.56]Did I throw a brick at you?
[03:34.32]I think it was blood, but it looks like a brick.
[03:38.03]Is there an invisible person?
[03:39.77]No, it's the mattress guy.
[03:41.63]Where is he?
[03:42.21]Oh, he's right there.
[03:42.91]Okay.
[03:46.77]Get out of here.
[03:47.79]Go back to Ikea.
[03:51.52]Who thought this was scary?
[03:53.02]Go back to Jordan's Furniture, you piece of crap.
[03:58.87]The upside down flying mattress man.
[04:01.21]There's more of them!
[04:01.83]There's more of them!
[04:02.39]What do you mean there's more of them?
[04:03.55]Where are they?
[04:08.07]Oh my god!
[04:08.73]They're like a flock of crows!
[04:14.00]Is one of them dead?
[04:15.12]Yes.
[04:18.98]Alright.
[04:19.44]That one's not dead.
[04:21.91]He's still sitting there all mattress-y.
[04:25.39]Something else, something else, something else.
[04:26.47]I heard it.
[04:28.04]I'm going to Billy Club him.
[04:29.02]I don't want to... Yeah, don't waste ammo.
[04:30.62]Don't waste ammo.
[04:31.42]He's stuck behind the bushes.
[04:32.78]We don't got to worry about this guy.
[04:36.06]Yeah, but he might... That guy might be a pain in the ass later.
[04:38.48]Okay, well, we got to go in this way, so... I think there's somebody... Yeah, there's a person in this house as well.
[04:43.39]There's somebody in that house.
[04:45.09]I can see its head.
[04:47.03]Yeah.
[04:48.27]Guns at the ready.
[04:49.23]Oh, my God.
[04:51.03]Oh, my God.
[04:51.53]Oh, my God.
[04:53.01]She dead?
[04:53.31]That was my girlfriend, Jerma.
[04:56.45]What the hell is that?
[04:57.13]What is that thing from, like, The Island of Dr. Moreau?
[05:00.37]No, that's from XCOM.
[05:01.81]How many different games of, like, enemies are they gonna throw at us?
[05:04.47]I can't... No, that's the thing from The Island of Dr. Moreau.
[05:07.89]Moreau, not Munro.
[05:09.21]The thing with... Who's the fat actor?
[05:11.25]I'm scared.
[05:12.00]I can't, like, think.
[05:15.34]You gotta be as crazy as them.
[05:17.38]Alright, good.
[05:17.98]What's this box over here?
[05:19.02]I don't know.
[05:19.78]Should we open it?
[05:20.36]Is that a pageant boy?
[05:22.98]Pageant boy.
[05:24.38]Can we just jump in the car?
[05:26.49]Nope, that'd be too easy.
[05:27.55]The door won't budge.
[05:31.71]None of these doors budge.
[05:33.37]Holy- Watch out!
[05:35.73]We got the Freddy Kruegers with the hammers.
[05:39.41]Freddy Krueger that, like, is being electrocuted.
[05:44.42]Don't you feel, like, at all, like, cruel for just wailing on the guy?
[05:47.80]What the fuck is that thing?
[05:50.64]What is that giant thing?
[05:57.95]You want to billy club it?
[05:59.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[06:03.49]I don't know what to do.
[06:04.79]Should we shoot him?
[06:05.87]Yeah, I'm shooting him.
[06:06.47]I got this rifle.
[06:11.17]I'm out of ammo for it.
[06:13.20]Should I shoot him in the face?
[06:16.88]He's dead.
[06:18.10]That just kind of legitimately freaked me out when I turned that corner.
[06:24.28]When he dies, why does he crumple up into like a... What the hell is this?
[06:28.70]I wanna get inside of it.
[06:30.88]I go down and do like a yoga position when I die.
[06:33.82]Crawl inside.
[06:34.36]I wanna see you inside of it.
[06:35.96]And his dumb character expression.
[06:37.60]Go.
[06:38.88]What, do you think you're gonna cover me from inside the hole?
[06:44.17]Yeah, go.
[06:44.59]I'm covering you.
[06:52.67]Am I on your head?
[06:53.41]No.
[06:56.03]How do you get up this?
[06:56.97]I don't know.
[07:00.19]I'll give you one hint.
[07:04.32]I seriously... Okay, you have to sprint and do it.
[07:07.06]That was so... That was very dramatic for what... See?
[07:10.36]See?
[07:11.20]I can't do this.
[07:12.22]I'm sprinting.
[07:13.36]You gotta like sprint.
[07:14.56]There you go.
[07:15.02]You got it.
[07:16.19]This game's good.
[07:16.85]This game's good.
[07:19.05]No more noises.
[07:20.65]Turn off your flashlight.
[07:23.80]That's completely silent now.
[07:25.14]Look what you did.
[07:26.78]Okay.
[07:28.16]Okay.
[07:29.44]Okay.
[07:30.94]Okay.
[07:32.48]Clear.
[07:33.61]Anything in here?
[07:34.59]Anything in here?
[07:35.55]Oh, on the ground right here.
[07:36.49]Ammo.
[07:37.03]Mine.
[07:37.83]Take it.
[07:38.33]Good.
[07:39.69]I still have... Fifteen rounds.
[07:42.17]I still have some shotgun shells left.
[07:43.49]I'm not concerned about this.
[07:44.83]What are we inside of right now?
[07:46.29]Who built this and for what reason?
[07:47.93]Yeah, I know.
[07:49.61]Oh, here's my log cabin.
[07:51.76]Where is it over there?
[07:54.78]Cover my tail.
[07:56.14]You're covering your tail.
[07:59.40]Here we go.
[08:00.02]Good.
[08:00.76]Yeah, what is this?
[08:02.86]And where are you?
[08:03.42]I lost you.
[08:06.54]oh my god dude where are you help me where oh my god this isn't fair I don't have any ammo
[08:27.93]It came over!
[08:28.57]It came over!
[08:29.51]Dude, that was ridiculous!
[08:31.87]Dude, I saw it.
[08:33.45]Like, the ground was destroyed.
[08:34.49]It's like, oh, he fell through these stairs.
[08:36.05]No problem.
[08:36.73]I'll go in after him.
[08:41.18]I fell through the stairs.
[08:42.42]Dude, that was so bad because I lost you, and that happened.
[08:48.00]The first time you go ahead without me.
[08:49.74]See, I need to... Do we seriously have to go up those stairs?
[08:54.16]I think we have to.
[08:55.00]I think that's like an event we have to do.
[08:58.39]So what we're going to do is we're going to bum rush it.
[09:00.21]Okay.
[09:00.61]Okay.
[09:00.97]No.
[09:01.43]No.
[09:01.61]Here's the thing.
[09:02.11]I mean, here's the thing.
[09:04.54]We need a strategy for this because we can't just go up these stairs.
[09:08.64]Don't go yet.
[09:09.62]Don't go yet.
[09:10.06]I'm not going to go.
[09:10.68]Okay.
[09:11.34]I'm checking my, like, which gun is going to be the best gun.
[09:14.36]I'm reloading the Glock.
[09:16.22]I got two pistols.
[09:17.58]How do I dual wield these?
[09:19.06]I don't know.
[09:20.08]There's a dual wheel button, but it like never works for me.
[09:22.36]Maybe I just was going too fast, and we actually don't, like you don't have to fall down there.
[09:27.43]Maybe you can like make it happen and then walk away.
[09:29.13]Alright, well whatever happens, I'm coming down after you.
[09:36.25]What the- OH MY GOD!
[09:39.71]Hold on, dude.
[09:40.13]You hear them like hustling?
[09:41.81]That's seriously- I seriously- that gave me a fucking hot attack.
[09:46.90]Why are they coming through walls now?
[09:49.28]It wasn't supposed to.
[09:50.26]That's the thing.
[09:50.98]We know what's going to happen.
[09:52.10]We know they're there, but... Am I seriously jumping in this first?
[09:57.33]Go.
[09:58.01]Go.
[09:58.35]Hold on.
[09:58.95]I'm figuring out how to dual wield.
[10:02.97]Give me a break.
[10:03.89]That was so stupid.
[10:04.84]It just came through the wall.
[10:07.30]How do you do this?
[10:08.80]I don't know, but we have to just do it.
[10:10.86]There's really no turning back.
[10:14.26]It didn't happen.
[10:21.15]Oh, my God.
[10:21.73]Germa, please.
[10:22.73]Germa, please.
[10:23.45]I don't have any bullets in this gun.
[10:26.37]We got it.
[10:27.61]There's one more.
[10:28.11]I hear, like, the... Nope.
[10:32.25]No, that's it.
[10:33.39]I can't believe we did that.
[10:35.54]What's even back here?
[10:36.86]Nothing.
[10:37.54]We had to do that so we could go up the stairs again.
[10:40.56]No, what?
[10:42.98]Are we stuck in here?
[10:46.56]No, there has to be a way to get through that.
[10:49.46]Can we shoot the...
[10:51.39]What?
[10:53.69]The accuracy.
[10:55.71]You are too good.
[10:58.53]I hear a bunch of noise.
[10:59.63]I hear like a swarm of bees.
[11:02.88]Oh no, not the bees.
[11:03.86]Oh no.
[11:04.62]Do you hear like that swarm of bees?
[11:06.64]Yeah.
[11:07.04]Get out your billy club for the bees.
[11:08.90]Alright, let's go.
[11:12.07]Get in there.
[11:13.13]I'm taking out a handgun.
[11:14.15]Are you kidding me?
[11:17.70]I don't want to go in here.
[11:18.50]Do you hear this?
[11:19.72]That's going to be a chainsaw guy.
[11:21.42]Oh my God.
[11:21.94]It is a chainsaw guy.
[11:23.48]Let me out.
[11:23.86]Let me out.
[11:24.16]Let me out.
[11:24.46]Let me out.
[11:24.72]Let me out.
[11:26.90]You can't get out now.
[11:27.76]You committed here.
[11:29.46]Here's what you do.
[11:30.36]Okay.
[11:30.64]Let me equip.
[11:31.46]Am I going to bait this guy for you?
[11:32.66]Let me equip this gun.
[11:33.66]Yeah.
[11:33.92]And you just bait him.
[11:34.80]There's a rifle on the ground at your feet.
[11:37.16]Oh, I hear him.
[11:40.00]Oh my God.
[11:40.52]What is he blending?
[11:41.46]Damn it, man.
[11:43.61]A blender.
[11:45.15]I don't know.
[11:45.61]I don't know if I can bait him back here.
[11:48.19]You got it.
[11:48.65]You got it.
[11:49.73]No, it's just a lady.
[11:50.63]Just a stupid, like, lady.
[11:53.35]There he is!
[11:53.87]There he is!
[11:54.51]He killed me.
[11:54.97]I'm dead.
[11:58.21]He's gonna get you!
[11:59.29]Oh my god, that's so fair!
[12:02.55]We knew he was there.
[12:03.85]What are you supposed to do?
[12:06.17]I don't know.
[12:08.41]Can you?
[12:08.69]Yeah, I got him.
[12:09.17]I got him.
[12:09.85]Oh.
[12:10.26]Oh my god, he's running.
[12:11.58]He's running.
[12:12.56]He can't get through.
[12:13.04]I don't think he can get through.
[12:14.82]I don't have any ammo.
[12:21.73]Neither do I. What do we do?
[12:23.75]I don't know.
[12:25.41]Is there a door in there?
[12:27.63]There is.
[12:28.65]Okay, so what we're going to do is we're both going to... Can you get in there?
[12:33.30]Whoa, what the?
[12:35.68]What the hell?
[12:39.06]I have no idea what we're going to do in this situation.
[12:43.07]I think we just have to get here with enough ammo.
[12:45.55]That's the only way we'll be able to be like all those ladies we shot.
[12:48.97]We should shoot those ladies, Jerma.
[12:50.52]Alright, going in.
[12:55.42]Oh my god, he's like... Oh my god, that was so dumb.
[13:07.16]If we want things to get spiced up, you know what we gotta do?
[13:09.88]What are we gonna do?
[13:11.96]We gotta stop being such little punks.
[13:13.74]Here, we got a gun.
[13:14.80]I'm just going.
[13:15.24]Let's go.
[13:16.44]I'm not waiting for you.
[13:17.42]We're not taking our time.
[13:18.32]I'm just running.
[13:20.35]You're gonna run through this?
[13:21.37]What about the guy with the bag on his head?
[13:22.65]I don't know.
[13:24.15]What about him?
[13:25.15]What about him?
[13:26.07]He just, like, punched me and I got, like, drunk.
[13:27.87]Well, it's not even a bag.
[13:28.65]Wait, what is this?
[13:29.56]Don't shoot.
[13:30.04]Don't shoot.
[13:33.48]I'm getting hurt.
[13:34.28]Yeah, I am.
[13:34.84]What is hitting me?
[13:35.80]No, it's this guy.
[13:37.02]Is he breathing on us too hard?
[13:38.84]I don't know, but his bad breath is giving us a headache.
[13:44.61]What the hell just happened?
[13:46.37]I killed him, and he speaker-phoned the hell out of there.
[13:49.47]I don't have any bolts.
[13:51.13]I need a syringe if we find one.
[13:52.47]I'm out.
[13:53.59]I got this assault rifle, but... I am out.
[13:56.78]Take this.
[13:57.22]I'm dropping this for you.
[14:00.44]Thank you.
[14:03.10]I'm gonna go quickly through this because I'm freaking... No, going the other way.
[14:07.34]Going the other way.
[14:23.89]I don't have any bullets.
[14:25.59]I don't have any bullets.
[14:31.02]I have to equip the branch.
[14:34.08]Where's the branch?
[14:36.34]Oh, she's glitched out.
[14:38.00]Quick, come on.
[14:39.43]I'm dead, Jerma.
[14:40.15]I can't see.
[14:42.31]You can't see me right here?
[14:43.25]I can see you standing on me, but that's it.
[14:52.76]Who else wants some?
[14:55.24]Oh, yeah, you can dodge.
[14:56.98]I forgot about that.
[14:58.36]Oh, wow, you can.
[14:58.86]There's the dodge button.
[15:01.44]That's why my character, like, double tap forward or back.
[15:05.38]Oh, okay.
[15:07.25]That's why I was like, oh, my character freaked out.
[15:09.27]I hear the bees.
[15:14.57]There's the guy.
[15:15.77]There's the bee.
[15:20.29]Oh, Jesus.
[15:22.19]Game over.
