[00:08.63]Hey, what's happening guys?
[00:10.27]Today, we're gonna be doing TF2, we're gonna be opening up some boxes.
[00:13.97]I've opened up quite a few of these already, and we're just gonna get into it.
[00:17.67]Hopefully I get something good, because I've been shafted quite a few times.
[00:22.61]So, enjoy the unboxing, let's go ahead and get number one open.
[00:26.88]It's a lightning rod, field tested.
[00:30.88]You know what?
[00:32.36]You know what, get them all open.
[00:33.93]Get them all open.
[00:34.71]Open them all right now.
[00:35.83]At the same time.
[00:36.97]Yeah, come on.
[00:38.83]No, I take it back.
[00:39.73]No, no, no.
[00:40.25]Oh, shit.
[00:42.05]I just blew through that.
[00:43.21]What an impulsive, stupid idea.
[00:49.01]And now I got a backpack that's in even worse shape than it was before this update.
[00:53.99]And it was in pretty bad shape before.
[00:56.65]But look at this.
[00:57.39]I got so many of these now from doing contracts and opening cases.
[01:00.93]I don't know.
[01:03.91]I counted.
[01:04.37]I have 13 of the McDonald's Happy Meal shotgun.
[01:10.56]What am I supposed to do with this stuff?
[01:13.56]Look at how many of these I have.
[01:15.64]Like, this one is well-worn with a strange on it.
[01:17.80]I don't even know what these things are worth.
[01:20.10]And look, look at this.
[01:21.14]I didn't even notice this before.
[01:23.23]Why do I have 10 strange knives?
[01:26.35]What purpose do these serve?
[01:27.89]You know, I'm just going to take the backpack off.
[01:33.23]Just get it off and take a look inside and see what you're actually working with.
[01:40.47]I don't... I don't know what this is.
[01:42.51]I don't know what that is.
[01:43.33]I don't even... It might be a strange... Here's a scattergun.
[01:46.55]I want to keep this.
[01:47.11]This is my strange scattergun.
[01:49.91]This is my Tommy's love.
[01:51.71]I know I have to hold on to that because it's worth like 15 cents.
[01:55.38]Here's... Oh, Jesus.
[02:01.27]What?
[02:02.41]This is a fucking dog bone?
[02:05.15]There's no dog bone item in TF2.
[02:06.93]I don't know where that came from.
[02:07.89]This is what I'm... This is a part of a sandwich, obviously.
[02:10.67]I just... I don't know what to... I don't know what to do with this stuff!
[02:16.81]I have too much of it!
[02:20.62]Hey, if you're going... Hey!
[02:22.76]I'll be right back.
[02:24.56]Yo, pick me up some french fries.
[02:26.68]The good ones from Wendy's.
[02:29.48]Are you listening to me?
[02:36.23]You fucking idiot.
[02:38.11]Ten knives.
[02:39.47]You gotta have ten knives, don't you?
[02:49.17]Hello?
[02:52.59]Hey.
[02:54.09]What's going on, dude?
[02:55.05]How you doing?
[02:56.61]You're outside right now?
[02:57.65]Yeah, yeah, just give me a second.
[03:01.39]Give me one second.
[03:01.95]I'll be right out.
[03:03.83]I'm so glad you're here.
[03:04.61]It's been like a year since I last saw you.
[03:06.65]You want to do something?
[03:07.35]What do you want to do?
[03:07.81]You want to go out?
[03:08.25]I don't have any more room.
[03:10.03]This is your problem now.
[03:11.75]What?
[03:12.67]Hey, hey, hey, hey, no!
[03:17.21]Come on, man.
[03:18.63]That was my first time!
[03:22.77]Whoa, Jesus.
[03:43.99]Assistant?
[03:45.25]Yes?
[03:46.23]Get in this room.
[03:47.55]What's wrong, sir?
[03:48.72]What's wrong?
[03:49.38]What's wrong?
[03:50.20]You piece of crap.
[03:51.34]What?
[03:51.56]I called you 15 seconds ago, maybe even 20, and it took you this long?
[03:55.44]I'm so sorry, sir.
[03:56.00]Get that fucking door open.
[03:57.44]I'm so sorry.
[03:58.34]Here you go, sir.
[03:59.22]Here.
[03:59.54]Hey, you know what?
[04:00.33]Next time you're late like that, the next... Conrad's a real bitch.
[04:03.43]You do something like that again?
[04:04.85]You embarrass me like that in front of all these 55 million people?
