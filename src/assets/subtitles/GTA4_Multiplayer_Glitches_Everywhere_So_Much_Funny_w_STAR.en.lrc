[00:08.99]Hold on.
[00:09.33]My god.
[00:09.69]Hold on a second.
[00:10.61]Do you see him sliding?
[00:11.99]No.
[00:13.39]He is sliding like no animation on my screen.
[00:23.58]Is he dead?
[00:24.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:26.48]I was going to beat him up, but... He's dead.
[00:29.04]Yo, Jeremy, look at this guy.
[00:30.58]He's dead.
[00:32.18]He's bleeding.
[00:33.40]There's a puddle of... Hold on.
[00:36.19]What happened?
[00:36.87]He tripped on this little triangle over here.
[00:40.77]He ran so fast.
[00:42.39]He hits this, and he died.
[00:45.29]Look how far... Look at his neck from over here.
[00:47.22]It kind of looks like it's broken, doesn't it?
[00:49.42]Dude, he must have smashed his face so hard to instantly die.
[00:58.86]Ooh.
[01:02.54]We're still riding the wheelie.
[01:05.34]Wow, you can hold this for a long time.
[01:07.16]Whoa!
[01:08.26]Oh my god!
[01:09.86]That was cool.
[01:11.44]Oh, we just...
[01:16.68]Oh fine, I got this.
[01:17.64]You wanna see my skills?
[01:18.72]Oh, here's a sick jump.
[01:36.83]Why is that jump there?
[01:41.89]That whole chain of events just didn't make any sense.
[01:45.80]And then I hit my face on a wall.
[01:48.34]That was awesome.
[01:51.44]What is this giant boat?
[01:52.84]Oh, I thought that was a boat.
[01:54.98]Here, let me do a wheelie onto this lady.
[01:56.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:57.75]You gotta... How did this happen?
[02:10.81]How did we get down here?
[02:14.70]No!
[02:15.56]You see that?
[02:16.34]I do.
[02:18.72]I'm not going to freak out.
[02:20.24]Can you snipe it?
[02:20.90]Can you snipe the guy out of it?
[02:22.40]I don't know.
[02:22.88]Don't shoot him.
[02:23.91]You don't want to risk it?
[02:24.81]No, because he'll step on the gas like sometimes they do.
[02:27.27]What is he doing?
[02:28.01]He already knows we're after him.
[02:29.35]He's like bullying this guy off the road.
[02:32.71]If I shoot this guy right now, he's going to step on the gas.
[02:36.09]Wouldn't you if you were in this car?
[02:39.33]We'll shoot him in the head.
[02:40.05]Go.
[02:41.21]Nice.
[02:42.97]I'm driving this.
[02:43.75]Not nice, because now the- WHERE IS HE?!
[02:45.81]Did he get you?
[02:53.16]He got you, Jerva!
[02:56.14]He was completely stopped!
[02:59.80]The ghost!
[03:00.78]The ghost of the guy in the GT!
[03:05.42]He wanted revenge!
[03:07.76]His otherworldly soul needed revenge on me!
[03:12.17]I can't believe that happened.
[03:14.75]Why did that happen?
[03:15.47]Wait until we got out.
[03:19.01]Is he dead?
[03:20.05]Yeah, I got him out of the car somehow.
[03:22.22]I think this car is cursed now though.
[03:25.02]No, it's getting away.
[03:25.98]Get in the car, get in the car, get in the car, get in the car.
[03:27.84]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[03:29.18]I'm trying.
[03:29.84]Dude, that lady is like, oh my god, do you see this lady?
[03:37.93]Hold on, did I got in the car?
[03:40.18]How did I get in the car?
[03:42.54]Don't question it, just go, go, go, go.
[03:44.70]Keep going straight.
[03:45.96]Pass, pass.
[03:47.46]I don't understand what just happened.
[03:49.16]Here we go.
[03:56.30]Let's see if you can do it.
[03:57.28]My whole life is riding on this moment.
[04:01.58]Your entire life is riding on if you can make this GTA jump.
[04:07.17]I will die if I don't do it.
[04:08.33]I'm dead.
[04:16.83]How does that happen?
[04:17.79]We hit the first step.
[04:22.60]Well, alright.
[04:23.24]Hold on.
[04:23.58]Let's think about this in reality right now.
[04:27.22]That's probably what would happen if you tried to do that.
[04:33.80]In the big... What the hell is going on?
[04:37.63]I thought you were going to drive right into that guy.
[04:39.35]Keep going.
[04:39.69]Keep going.
[04:40.07]Keep going.
[04:40.43]Keep going.
[04:41.21]Not going in the tunnel.
[04:41.81]Go to the left of the tunnel.
[04:42.91]Alright.
[04:43.09]We're going to turn right again.
[04:45.33]I don't think that's going to... We're fine.
[04:49.36]We're fine.
[04:50.02]We're fine.
[04:50.36]We're fine.

[04:51.98]Fast.
[04:52.22]Hit this guy.
[04:55.50]Ten points.
[04:57.12]Don't get hit by these cars.
[04:57.92]Oh my god.
[05:03.08]You did, didn't you?
[05:04.02]I hit my face on the lamppost.
[05:09.29]Okay, get on your bike.
[05:11.30]Meet me.
[05:11.68]Hold on, I'm recovering from this laugh.
[05:20.55]Sick burnout, bro.
[05:29.95]Did you see the guy hit behind you oh my god?
[05:37.64]This is so like a rude.
[05:40.04]I can't oh Good thing good good.
[05:43.48]We wanted to do as much car damage to this as humanly possible.
[05:46.62]Yes before it blows up You know what Jeremiah I?
[05:51.94]Say we get it to the point where it's gonna blow up.
[05:53.54]It's on fire.
[05:54.06]Yep.
[05:54.72]Yep.
[05:55.24]All right.
[05:55.46]What do I do with it?
[05:56.18]Just keep driving
[05:59.04]Just pretend, like, you know, you want to go to, like, 7-Eleven, like, get some late night snacks.
[06:03.36]Yeah, don't, they have, uh, drinks at 7-Eleven, right?
[06:06.55]Of course they do.
[06:07.07]Yeah, that's usually all I get at 7-Eleven.
[06:08.71]I don't know if, like, you want, um, like, Funyuns or some weird... I was pretty close, but I, like, bumped something.
[06:16.89]We're going over the bridge.
[06:17.65]I'm sick of this place.
[06:19.75]Oh, no, this tire, this tire's not having it.
[06:22.27]It's...

[06:35.78]How would I have been able to do that, GTA?
[06:39.92]He killed it.
[06:40.48]He ran himself over.
[06:41.60]I didn't do anything.
