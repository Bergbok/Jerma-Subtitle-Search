[00:02.95]Let's go ahead and refresh all and just see what, you know, what servers are available right now to me to play in Team Fortress 2.
[00:11.89]300, 400, 500.
[00:13.13]Keep coming, come on, come on, big money, come on, 700.
[00:18.56]Come on, big money here, we got big money, 800, 900.
[00:21.30]We're up to over a thousand servers.
[00:24.66]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[00:25.74]Listen, listen, stop.
[00:27.16]How many people are playing on TC Hydro right now?
[00:31.54]In over 1,200 servers, there's only six human beings.
[00:36.49]That just ain't gonna cut it.
[00:37.83]All right, Charlie, boot it up.
[00:39.23]Turn it on.
[00:40.15]Boot up the time machine.
[00:41.21]We're going back.
[00:42.07]There it is.
[00:42.79]We're going back to 2007.
[00:44.43]Star, you coming with me?
[00:46.57]Let's go.
[00:47.05]Oh, don't throw up.
[00:49.37]Oh, don't throw up.
[00:51.43]Did we just go back in time?
[00:53.65]We did.
[00:53.99]Are you okay?
[00:54.63]You feeling alright?
[00:55.05]I didn't think I was going to work.
[00:56.05]Yeah, no, that was great.
[00:57.25]Just watch your step out of the time machine.
[00:58.73]It's really important that you do that.
[01:00.83]Do you have any idea where we are right now?
[01:03.36]I don't know when we are.
[01:04.76]We could have gone back in any point in history.
[01:07.08]We came back to TC Hydro Team Fortress 2.
[01:11.24]I'm going back to see the dinosaurs.
[01:12.70]This is stupid.
[01:13.42]No, what do you mean?
[01:14.04]You can't go... No, no, no, no, no.
[01:15.67]That's my time machine!
[01:17.33]Hey!
[01:19.25]He actually used it.
[01:21.42]I'm stuck on Hydro forever!
[01:26.84]I don't even know if this is a good spot for this or not.
[01:29.86]I'm sure we'll find out in the 7 minutes and 35 seconds that we're not going to be playing on this map.
[01:37.42]Or this part of this map, or this round, or this mo, whatever you want to call it.
[01:40.52]This quadrant of Hydro.
[01:44.20]Spy capping?
[01:44.94]I remember spy caps on Hydro were insane.
[01:49.56]If a spy was back here right now and I didn't have this, he could just stand on this and you probably would win.
[01:54.34]But that ain't gonna happen, because I have a big sentry.
[01:57.46]See?
[01:58.12]Bang.
[02:00.00]Orc XL.
[02:01.42]You got it.
[02:02.45]Now you could be... No, you're not a spy.
[02:04.39]I remember people go through this choke here.
[02:09.53]And that's all I remember.
[02:11.59]I don't remember much.
[02:13.17]It's been so long since the time machine was destroyed.
[02:15.87]I've been on it probably for 20 years.
[02:19.46]It's all becoming a blur.
[02:20.58]Do they have an engineer, too?
[02:25.08]I don't know.
[02:25.46]Actually, you know what?
[02:27.50]I remember this.
[02:28.00]I remember.
[02:28.30]It's all coming back to me.
[02:29.72]It's all coming back to me.
[02:30.44]I'm going to have a sentry gun right here.
[02:33.86]And it's going to make everybody's lives better.
[02:35.40]That would be heavy.
[02:39.43]That would be a lot of people.
[02:41.37]I just... Please.
[02:42.73]Just... I don't know where to go.
[02:44.33]I'm not sure.
[02:44.95]Just repair it.
[02:45.61]And just stand here.
[02:46.31]I have one revenge crit.
[02:47.33]I've got to make this one count.
[02:52.36]You know what I could probably build a dispenser which I will right here Get out of here get yeah, I could have sworn you were a spy, but you're not I Don't like the way this place looks either like this.
[03:04.75]I feel like I'm in like a cave I Mean technically we are in a cave, but like look at this.
[03:09.74]I don't know.
[03:10.06]I don't like it hurts my eyes Wow
[03:15.36]That's one way to do it.
[03:16.68]Okay.
[03:18.66]I guess we're doing okay.
[03:21.12]Watch the stairs.
[03:22.30]Watch the stairs.
[03:24.36]I've got six kills in this thing right now.
[03:27.42]I'm like on a total, total tear.
[03:31.87]I can't believe this is still going.
[03:34.37]Hydro is not supposed to last this long.
[03:37.85]Oh, oh, oh.
[03:38.77]We're gonna win.
[03:39.29]We're gonna win.
[03:39.65]You know what?
[03:40.59]Let's do it.
[03:41.57]With all my crits.
[03:42.63]Let's make this happen.
[03:45.02]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[03:46.70]Come on, come on, cap it, cap it!
[03:48.60]Yeah!
[03:52.14]Hydro.
[03:53.96]Where you get 13 points, 6 points, and 3 points.
[03:59.09]And you win the game.
[04:00.19]Did I just really get somebody?
[04:08.67]Look at this room.
[04:10.49]This hallway is just stuffed full of people.
[04:13.41]I didn't kill him.
[04:15.24]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:16.84]No, no, no, no.
[04:19.50]Get off this point!
[04:24.00]Geez.
[04:24.48]Alright, well, I'm sticking around here.
[04:27.69]I don't want just some random dude to walk right in and just instantly win the game.
[04:34.11]That does not bode well.
[04:37.35]We got... There's an engineer over here now.
[04:40.67]I think we should be okay.
[04:43.43]The question is, can we... Hey, hey, come here.
[04:48.90]Where the... what?
[04:50.54]Where'd he go?
[04:51.10]Did he drop down?
[04:54.20]I'm confused.
[04:55.32]I'm dropping down, screw it.
[04:59.22]The fuck just happened?
[05:00.22]165?
[05:00.94]That did 165 damage?
[05:03.20]I jumped off, that was like a 10 foot drop.
[05:04.64]That's bullshit.
[05:14.12]For this experiment to work, we've got to win three times.
[05:17.76]Did once.
[05:19.99]Can do it again.
[05:22.67]Ooh, gotcha.
[05:24.71]Ooh, gotcha.
[05:27.03]This is going to be a second win.
[05:28.19]This is going to be a second win.
[05:30.21]Yeah, this is win number two.
[05:32.22]And I don't even need to make an edit, I don't think.
[05:34.64]Because that was like two seconds.
[05:38.13]So, we can just keep talking about, like, I don't know, the weather.
[05:41.43]So, it's kind of, eh, sunny out, right?
[05:42.97]Overcast right now.
[05:44.51]It ain't bad.
[05:44.97]It ain't very good, either.
[05:47.15]Well, I know how to play Territory Control.
[05:50.95]Don't worry.
[05:51.65]I've played it before, Valve.
[05:54.03]Let's do it again.
[05:55.41]In the same, like, two minutes, let's get the third victory on Hydro.
[06:00.65]And then I can go eat, like, a banana.
[06:03.73]Because I had just bought a bunch of bananas.
[06:06.31]So, like, why not, right?
[06:07.53]Why wouldn't you eat a bunch of bananas?
[06:09.36]Why there's this many people in this one tunnel?
[06:13.30]This is, like... We're gonna win.
[06:16.12]This is it.
[06:18.02]Yeah, this is game over.
[06:19.24]I didn't do anything.
[06:21.36]I didn't do anything.
[06:22.22]Game over.
[06:23.26]Game over four points.
[06:27.06]Dude, what?
[06:29.98]Ugh.
[06:34.45]Let's do it again!
[06:36.85]Third time's a charm, let's go.
[06:40.11]No edits, we're not doing any editing right now.
[06:42.63]I wanna see for myself if it's possible to get the trifecta on Hydro in less than, like, four or five minutes.
[06:51.36]Because if it is... Wait a minute, no, don't let this guy get by.
[06:54.66]He can't break up the trifecta!
[06:57.66]Oh, he really is... What is he... What?
[07:03.13]What is happening?
[07:03.88]Where is this point?
[07:04.60]How did we just win the game?
[07:06.92]It's just chaos.
[07:11.42]Hydro.
[07:15.10]Look at this whole team.
[07:16.31]There's no rhyme or reason to anything that's happening right now.
[07:23.09]Things are just happening.
[07:26.03]And we're going to win.
[07:29.02]Congratulations, red team.
[07:30.82]You did it.
[07:33.53]one.
