[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.38]Okay.
[00:03.84]What else do we have?
[00:07.16]To finish up.
[00:14.60]Hide behind the table in the camera room?
[00:16.90]Uh, no.
[00:17.50]What do you have a filter on?
[00:20.74]Well, I don't.
[00:21.08]I just turned the gamma down.
[00:23.54]Do Breath of the Wild?
[00:24.46]No, I'd rather, I don't want to start that now.
[00:27.76]What can I do for the next, like, 30 minutes?
[00:29.55]What do you think?
[00:33.80]I got a couple other games.
[00:34.94]Let me see.
[00:35.40]What else do I have here?
[00:45.04]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[00:50.38]Okay, fine.
[00:52.26]I will do... No, I'm not playing that.
[00:56.02]I'm not playing Five Nights at Freddy's.
[01:03.81]Because I'm going to have to do night one again, and I don't want to sit through night one.
[01:10.30]Please.
[01:16.56]You really want me to play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[01:22.32]It's Freddy's 2.
[01:23.40]Okay, so I want a poll for me to play Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[01:35.49]And it has to be at least 75%.
[01:36.91]And I'll do it right now.
[01:46.00]What about Faith?
[01:47.64]I do have Faith, but I feel like it's too late to start it.
[01:51.32]I would come back and play it.
[01:54.40]Five Nights at Freddy's 2.
[01:55.38]Yeah.
[01:59.81]I would play that next week.
[02:02.91]Just because it's not Halloween anymore doesn't mean I can't play them.
[02:13.25]Five Nights at Freddy's 2, it's going to be at least 75%.
[02:18.48]I don't think this is going to win.
[02:21.10]Judging by the preliminary amount here.
[02:29.52]That's the best one?
[02:30.69]Yeah, I think it probably is.
[02:33.73]Let me see if I can help you guys.
[02:35.85]Vote for it.
[02:36.57]Let's make it happen.
[02:38.59]I want to see 75%.
[02:45.80]I'm not sure it's even going to get there.
[02:48.56]What was the other one?
[02:49.56]Hold on.
[02:51.32]I swear I had another couple of games that I wanted to do.
[02:53.60]I don't think it's going to make it.
[03:06.16]He wants to play it so bad.
[03:07.26]I have like the other DreadX Collection stuff.
[03:12.15]Let's do that.
[03:12.73]What about DreadX Collection 5?
[03:14.07]I'll just play a couple of random things.
[03:16.81]Yeah, you're not going to make it.
[03:17.61]I'm doing DreadX Collection 5.
[03:25.35]You guys are just not going to make it.
[03:35.26]Yeah, I said 75%.
[03:35.98]You didn't get there.
[03:36.48]Okay, let me capture it.
[03:49.99]Uh, video resolution.
[03:51.35]That's fine.
[03:52.09]That's fine.
[03:52.79]Field of view is fine.
[03:54.86]This is fine.
[03:55.76]Okay.
[03:58.96]Uh, story.
[03:59.62]There's a story mode on this?
[04:05.38]Interesting.
[04:11.62]This is number five.
[04:15.10]Story mode.

[05:27.71]Beyond the Curtain.
[05:28.43]Alright, what's a good one?
[05:34.11]This is Collection 5.
[05:37.97]This one's so good.

[05:53.64]I need to get unlocked.
[05:58.41]Error, please assemble band before musical performance.
[06:04.49]OK.
[06:20.83]Assemble band.
[06:34.43]Is every single door stuck?
[06:38.33]Just going to the bathroom?
[06:45.55]Gas can is piss.
[06:48.51]Does that mean that there's piss in the gas can?
[06:50.37]Or does that mean... I thought it was my name.
[06:59.71]What is this?
[07:03.75]Can I read it?
[07:06.69]No better than go outside when the... Besides, Eldrin was too longer a child.
[07:15.46]He hadn't time to be afraid of silly bedtime stories.
[07:18.38]Only babies were afraid of the Strangle Man.
[07:20.38]Okay.
[07:24.20]Ooh, a present.
[07:26.68]Take it back to my birthday table to open it.
[07:39.84]and here we go somebody said this is the best one we'll find out
[08:08.39]It's a black screen?
[08:09.07]Huh?
[08:09.17]Why is it a black screen?
[08:09.69]Hold on.
[08:41.98]Why can't you see it?
[08:42.62]Oh, no.
[08:49.94]Weird.
[08:50.76]What if I do this?
[08:57.45]Is that going to do it?
[09:08.66]I don't think this.
[09:09.62]I can't capture this.
[09:10.48]Why?
[09:10.78]That's weird.
[09:22.38]Can you see it?
[09:26.66]No.
[09:26.88]Huh?
[09:32.21]Yeah, this is with window capture on.
[09:33.63]The other one was game capture.
[09:34.65]Now it captured the other game.
[09:43.91]What if I... Hold on.
[09:50.08]Okay, that was very strange.
[09:51.48]So I cannot have it in full screen.
[09:58.39]So it has to be in a window.
[09:59.49]Okay.
[10:02.59]That's fine.
[10:10.93]What the fuck is this?
[10:11.73]What the hell?
[10:25.41]You can't see it anymore.
[10:36.04]Dude, what?
[10:44.78]Okay, now the game capture works.
[10:50.36]I'm just gonna keep it on this, I guess.
[10:57.24]Let's turn off the window capture.
[11:00.35]Why don't you try that thing I told you about?
[11:02.49]Seven flowers down the well.
[11:06.07]I don't believe in these things, but that's how I met your mother.
[11:22.61]She's still alive to see what kind of a coward you become.
[11:25.51]I can't imagine how hurt she would be.
[11:48.58]Drop seven flowers into the well and you will see the reflection of your future love.
[11:52.95]Though anyone loving you here seems impossible.
[11:55.11]Okay.

[12:55.78]I just got pissed on.
[12:58.14]I just got- somebody just peed on me.
[12:59.38]Okay.

[14:39.08]Okay, I need to find flowers.
[14:40.12]Am I dying?
[14:40.88]Guys, I think I'm dying.
[14:44.50]Is there a heal?
[15:12.35]That pattern is weird.
[15:13.87]I forgot what it means to be true.
[15:22.35]Is there a heel?
[15:47.52]There has to be a heal somewhere, right?
[15:52.14]Hey, look at how fucked up this pattern is.
[16:03.77]One.
[16:03.95]One.
[16:09.29]You didn't even make it through that.
[16:10.44]That's bullshit.
[16:11.68]That didn't make it through.
[16:14.27]Okay, so it's one, two.
[16:15.41]When we go, like, um... I'm just gonna die.
[16:23.88]Three more?

[22:48.56]I... No, you don't?
[22:57.69]Oh, okay.

[23:07.20]Is there somebody else here?
[23:42.62]Those things.
[23:43.36]I have to give it to those two.
[23:53.22]Oh, I thought they were numbers.
[23:59.79]I thought they were on my side.
[24:03.60]I've done it!
[24:04.20]Just one more thing to do and then we can be together.
[24:09.44]Go and meet your father.
[24:11.22]Okay.
[24:37.59]I'm proud of you, my love.
[24:39.41]There's nothing that can stop you anymore and the world is ours.
[24:42.00]Now go and make them all suffer.
[24:43.56]Is that a pig?
[24:52.80]That was interesting.
[25:05.15]That was very weird.
[25:10.60]That was very interesting.
[25:14.38]I don't know how to feel about it.
[25:15.24]It was just so bizarre.
[25:20.99]Okay.
[25:23.09]Pretty cool.
[25:25.81]Let's see if I'm still capturing the game.
[25:31.83]Which I don't think I am.
[25:35.69]Is it still open?
[25:39.80]Uh-oh.
[25:40.60]I think it crashed.
[25:42.50]No, we're still here.
[25:45.16]That was kind of weird.
[25:48.98]There we go.
[25:49.56]Okay.
[25:52.46]Another page of the book.
[25:55.22]Strangle Man.
[25:56.68]Just a silly book.
[26:03.56]What's another good one?
[26:08.90]Should we do the karaoke one?
[26:17.86]Karaoke one's good.
[26:25.01]I need another present.
[26:32.99]Error.
[26:33.81]Please assemble band before musical performance.
[26:37.17]Okay.
[26:41.29]When are you gonna play Roblox?
[26:42.13]I'll play Roblox on your birthday, okay?
[26:50.55]Next year.
[26:50.93]Oh, here's a page.
[26:54.67]Okay.
[27:01.22]Alright, give me a present.
[27:05.58]The 10th has been circled.
[27:07.26]10th of October...
[27:11.55]Uh, I'm not reading all that.
[27:20.83]Present.
[27:30.19]The next present.
[27:41.22]I missed it.
[27:41.62]Turn the light on and off.
[28:00.10]What the fuck happened?
[28:20.58]Oh, thank you.
[28:26.98]Alright, I'll do the karaoke one.
[28:31.86]I hope it captures.
[28:32.52]I think I have to do the window again.
[28:47.20]This video game contains flashes of light.
[28:49.98]Viewer discretion is advised.
[28:51.04]Okay.
[28:59.87]I have to capture the window.
[29:00.83]That's so weird how that happens.
[29:04.97]I think it's because it's a compilation and it's loading a different game.
[29:16.12]Right there.
[29:17.85]Okay.
[29:18.29]So that should do it.
[29:18.95]Alright.
[29:26.19]Why is this on the screen?
[29:29.73]Oh, um, huh?
[29:36.61]What's going on?
[29:37.17]I think it crashed.
[29:41.62]Shit.
[29:42.06]What?
[29:54.37]Uh, yeah, it's crashed.
[29:55.87]Shit.
[29:56.43]Come on, really?
[30:06.85]Can I reload it?
[30:07.61]Let me try reloading it.
[30:26.20]I'll try one more time.
[30:26.76]Okay, new game.
[30:38.86]I'm just gonna do new game.
[30:39.90]Okay.
[30:43.54]You don't see it, but that's alright.
[30:45.02]I'm just trying to get into the game first.
[30:49.09]Like, right here.
[30:50.37]Hold on.
[30:54.86]Oh, this is fucked up.
[30:58.85]Um.
[31:01.19]This is very bizarre.
[31:02.71]Okay.
[31:03.85]Can you see it now?
[31:11.58]I think you can see it now.
[31:17.32]Hey!
[31:17.46]It's loud as all hell.
[31:19.14]Turn that down.
[31:19.84]Alright.
[31:21.32]Let's try it.
[31:26.65]He looks busy.
[31:29.21]Broken... I guess it's a karaoke machine.
[31:30.93]Okay.
[31:44.46]I have no interest in talking to this guy.
[31:55.74]One shot, please.
[31:56.62]Okay.
[31:58.02]Take it.
[32:01.20]Jasper and Lace.
[32:01.70]I'm Jasper, the guy by the stage's lace.
[32:03.60]And before you ask, yes, we're identical twins.
[32:06.33]Okay.
[32:07.45]Where's the toilet?
[32:08.13]It's broken.
[32:08.63]What if I have to go?
[32:09.25]This is why we only sell shots.
[32:11.25]You drank too much before you came here.
[32:15.73]There's a toilet in the back.
[32:17.73]Okay, thanks.
[32:22.57]It's a headlamp.
[32:24.71]Okay.
[32:28.67]No problem.
[32:29.13]Code for the door is 145.
[32:30.35]Alright, so, did I get it?
[32:34.96]Thank you.
[32:48.85]Lights seem to be working.
[32:49.69]I'll keep the headlamp off for now.
[33:04.79]This must be Phil better not wake him.
[33:26.09]Okay.
[33:34.76]I'm in here.
[33:36.06]What now?
[33:36.42]Okay.
[33:37.98]That was beautiful.
[34:18.08]A rail lever?
[34:20.24]One of seven.
[34:25.58]Rail lever.
[34:28.64]Okay.
[34:44.36]Huh?
[34:44.80]What's happening?
[34:46.96]What?
[34:47.59]What is that?
[34:48.37]What is that?
[35:22.17]Is this a granny-like?
[35:23.01]No, no, I don't think so.
[35:23.95]This is not a granny-like.
[35:24.73]I woke up early this morning.
[35:27.83]Tried to get the blood out of my hair.
[35:30.45]Cranking up the sound on my knife blade.
[35:32.10]Trapping off into these downstairs.
[35:33.54]My spine will hold to my memory.
[35:56.44]How do I move?
[36:05.44]How do I get out of here?
[36:31.00]I was waiting for it.
[36:38.24]I was like, I thought it was going to come this way.
[36:40.11]Nope.
[36:41.01]Right into the ground.
[36:41.65]Okay.
[37:21.22]There's a bed down here.
[37:32.06]Huh?
[37:37.40]Yeah?
[37:38.10]What else?
[37:38.78]What else is going on?
[38:04.48]What does that mean?
[38:20.96]You should've just pissed in the street.
[38:48.06]No!
[38:49.60]What are you shooting at me?
[39:11.58]You're shooting a gun at me.
[39:12.90]You're shooting a gun at me.
[39:13.78]You have a gun and you're shooting it.
[39:15.98]Where am I?
[39:22.63]Oh my god.
[39:23.39]Okay, I'm alive.
[39:39.14]Hello.
[39:39.46]Hello?
[39:43.58]I'm sorry I scared you.
[39:45.57]I'm not used to visitors.
[39:46.33]You're not supposed to be up there.
[39:47.59]That area is shut off.
[39:49.95]I'm up here by mistake.
[39:51.94]Well, you better get out of there.
[39:52.84]There's a lady with a gun.
[39:53.88]A lady with a gun?
[39:54.64]Yeah.
[39:54.96]I don't have time for this.
[39:56.60]You're all the same.
[39:57.60]You tunnel people.
[39:58.32]You're all out of your goddamn minds.
[40:01.06]Tell you what.
[40:01.48]Go back up.
[40:02.98]And out the air vent.
[40:04.74]Enter the code 789 by the gate to the tunnels.
[40:07.38]Take the right tunnel, not the left one.
[40:10.78]I was just... Okay.
[40:12.52]Take the right one, not the left one.
[40:14.44]789, gate to the tunnels.
[40:22.08]Okay.
[40:23.94]I get that a lot from you people.
[40:26.04]Run along now.
[40:29.19]Alright, 789.
[40:29.89]And it's the gate?
[40:31.39]Okay.
[40:36.85]Where is that?
[40:48.97]Can I get back up here?
[40:51.87]How do I get out of here?
[40:58.82]Is there a different way?
[40:59.44]I need to crouch?
[41:07.08]This is a jump at the ground.
[41:08.42]I don't know.
[41:08.68]Let's try that again.
[41:09.27]Can I just?
[41:18.51]No, I can't.
[41:19.69]Oh, I can.
[41:43.25]The door's locked?
[41:43.93]Wait, what did that just open?
[41:48.98]789, what did that just do?
[41:56.14]What did it do?
[42:04.87]The gate right next to you opened.
[42:06.75]I wasn't even looking.
[42:26.24]I need to know why he didn't want me to go into the left tunnel.
[42:30.20]He said, don't go there.
[42:31.26]Why would I go into the left tunnel?
[42:32.47]What do you mean I want to find out why he wanted me not to go down the left tunnel?
[42:38.79]That's not how this works.
[42:41.41]I really need to figure out why he didn't want me to go down there.
[42:46.54]No, you just listen, man.
[42:47.54]I have a gun.
[43:21.67]I've got a weapon now.
[43:41.36]Sorry!
[44:05.99]Hey!
[44:07.73]Five.
[44:41.92]Five.
[44:45.37]Eight.
[44:48.29]Five, eight.
[44:52.57]Five, eight?
[44:57.03]What else can I do?
[44:57.59]Is there anything else to see?
[44:58.55]I can't see anything.
[45:00.70]Five, eight.
[45:06.32]Five, eight, one?
[45:08.68]Five, eight, one.
[45:12.97]581.
[45:13.05]I definitely need these.
[45:28.90]Okay.
[45:36.95]That song is terrifying.
[46:04.58]Jesus.
[46:41.32]You're gonna stand up, aren't you?
[46:46.88]No!
[46:47.98]Fuck!
[47:00.53]How far away am I?
[47:11.01]It's not that far.
[47:11.75]Okay, go down the other tunnel.
[47:23.38]Okay, alright.
[47:24.28]Wait, what?
[47:24.78]Yeah, let's go.
[47:29.50]Now I get what I'm supposed to be doing.
[47:31.42]Speed runtime.
[47:37.18]It's 5, 8, 1, and I can just walk.
[47:38.38]I can run through this.
[47:45.93]581.
[47:46.01]Uh oh.
[48:05.61]I think I have to do it.
[48:43.73]Let's go.
[48:47.79]What?
[48:53.60]This is pretty scary.
[48:54.66]It is.
[48:54.96]It's just off putting.
[49:02.60]OK, back where I was.
[49:04.06]I have not been hit yet, so that's good.
[49:18.72]Okay, that's a lot of shots.
[49:24.02]Okay, don't die here.
[49:49.88]Jesus.
[50:10.43]Hey!
[50:10.83]Where?
[50:11.51]Where are you?
[50:11.99]I don't know where they are.
[50:14.01]Where?
[50:28.70]Okay, there's another code right here.
[50:39.45]Where are you?
[50:56.87]Where?
[51:24.43]Wait, what?
[51:24.89]This is just back to where I was.
[51:28.46]Did I miss something?
[51:56.24]I'm just going back down here.
[52:28.51]Poor guy, now he's just number 367.
[52:36.98]Oh shit, okay.
[52:37.66]Let's go.
[52:37.90]When it's time
[53:00.46]367?
[53:00.52]Wait, that's not the right one.
[53:06.10]Wait.
[53:07.60]Where was that door?
[53:08.38]It was back here.
[53:18.24]Where was that shit?
[53:19.40]There it is.
[53:28.31]Where's that?
[53:33.99]Where was that?
[53:47.15]Where you just were.
[53:47.89]Oh shit.
[53:59.12]Okay.
[54:10.82]Jasper.
[54:52.54]What the fuck?
[54:57.89]Excuse me, where am I?
[54:59.53]You're in Potogzau.
[55:02.21]Who are you?
[55:03.89]I'm Stig, the tram operator.
[55:06.85]Where does the tram go?
[55:08.97]Down the mountain into the valley.
[55:10.03]Can you see all the... Can you see the lit window?
[55:12.45]The red light?
[55:12.99]It's been blinking all night.
[55:15.63]It's irritating.
[55:16.13]The blinking doesn't have anything better to do.
[55:20.88]Who is she?
[55:21.32]She's a nobody.
[55:23.00]If she were to disappear, I don't think anyone would care.
[55:29.07]How do I get to her?
[55:29.67]With the tram, but we only operate the tram at night during special occasions, such as the famous Patagzao Orienteering Gathering.
[55:39.43]What if I need to use it?
[55:41.64]Wait till morning.
[55:43.86]Then you'll need the approval of Maria, my manager.
[55:47.26]How do I find Maria?
[55:50.41]Walk along the train tracks and into the forest.
[55:52.15]You'll find her eventually.
[55:53.03]Okay.
[55:53.73]Am I dead?
[55:54.19]I'm not a mortician.
[55:56.85]I'm a tram operator.
[55:57.76]Okay.
[56:00.14]If this was a dream, we'd probably be somewhere else than in Ptukovskaya.
[56:06.32]What choice do I have?
[56:06.94]I like it.
[56:07.34]Okay.
[56:07.92]So follow the train tracks.
[56:09.30]I have full health.
[56:30.15]To ride, talk to tram operator.
[56:41.50]Walk along the train tracks.
[56:43.45]Where are they?
[56:45.59]Down here?
[57:01.35]I am technically... technically correct.
[57:03.87]That was technically correct.
[57:13.87]Okay.
[57:16.13]Run down the tracks.
[57:20.43]How am I supposed to do that?
[57:24.85]Did I just overshoot it?
[57:43.94]Huh?
[57:50.38]What?
[57:50.56]That wasn't the tracks.
[57:51.94]How?
[57:52.22]But that's the tracks.
[57:54.35]That was the tracks.
[58:01.67]Okay.
[58:03.79]I guess not.
[58:06.23]You were just on the tracks.
[58:09.96]You mean like up here?
[58:13.69]Is it what this is?
[58:15.05]I thought this is the train train tracks, not tram tracks.
[58:26.64]Those aren't train tracks.
[58:27.78]That's a tram track.
[58:34.72]Fucking tram track in front of your eyes.
[58:43.43]Yeah, I thought it was like the go on the train track, like I'm the tram operator, get on the train tram tracks.
[59:15.67]Is I supposed to do that?
[60:02.00]Oh, they're writing shit.
[60:02.86]OK, what does it say?
[60:03.70]9 4 9 4 6
[60:31.27]There's one more.
[60:31.81]9 something 463.
[60:33.89]9.
[60:33.91]Something 463.
[61:05.14]nine two four six three nine two four six three okay
[61:34.59]What is the camera covering?
[61:35.93]Uh, just the amount of bullets I have.
[61:37.24]It's 57.
[61:37.40]Jesus.
[62:13.45]Oops.
[62:14.33]Okay.
[62:14.75]I think it automatically did it.
[62:15.83]Oh!
[63:07.88]Oh!
[63:08.60]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[63:13.21]Oh my fucking god, there's so many of them.
[63:16.49]I... It's so disorienting.
[63:18.57]Okay, am I alright?
[63:34.25]I woke up early this morning trying to get the blood out of my hair.
[63:41.58]Can I get on there?
[63:45.90]This is fucked up.
[64:08.85]This is long.
[64:09.43]I didn't think it was gonna be this long.
[64:11.81]I feel we're probably near the end.
[64:13.29]Okay.
[64:32.40]Am I hitting golf balls or something?
[64:40.66]How do I talk to this person?
[64:41.38]I don't think I can get up here.
[65:03.17]The ladder?
[65:03.57]I can't climb the ladder.
[65:10.94]I can't get up here.
[65:21.04]Oh.
[65:21.68]Maria?
[65:22.04]I need to ride the tram.
[65:26.40]Why are you telling me?
[65:27.14]Did Stig send you here?
[65:28.46]Yes, he said you're the manager.
[65:31.45]Oh, that's funny.
[65:32.65]I'm not his manager.
[65:33.27]We don't work together.
[65:33.93]Stig is my orienteering buddy.
[65:37.90]Bring me back some of my golf balls from the forest and I'll let you.
[65:40.78]I'll tell you.
[65:43.46]Find your own way back to the tram then.
[65:44.90]Alright, I'll get you golf balls.
[65:49.30]What's your handicap?
[65:50.86]4?
[65:51.78]5?
[65:52.54]45?
[65:54.54]What are you shooting at?
[65:57.52]Okay, so I gotta go get your golf balls.
[66:34.43]I think I should have found one by now.
[66:38.63]Oh.
[66:43.75]What is this?
[66:44.31]Okay.
[67:07.95]What?
[67:08.17]5-5-5-8.
[67:11.13]Uh, was I?
[67:12.23]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[67:21.02]I didn't talk.
[67:22.86]What?
[67:23.70]The train tunnel entrance has a new code.
[67:25.54]5-5-5-8.
[67:25.68]What?
[67:26.22]I don't know what I just did.
[67:43.38]Um... They're pointing at this.
[67:47.49]Can I close it?
[67:57.44]5558.
[68:00.60]Train tunnel entrance has a new code.
[68:26.82]I woke up early this morning.
[68:41.57]What's the twist here, right?
[68:42.85]There's got to be some twist.
[68:43.97]There's no way it's just this.
[68:49.37]What happened to me being at a karaoke bar?
[68:51.29]I forgot that even happened.
[69:14.70]Here it comes!
[69:38.49]What the fuck?
[69:40.24]Who's shooting?
[69:40.98]Where?
[69:41.27]From where?
[70:26.58]Shut up, where are you shooting?
[70:28.06]Oh my goodness.
[70:29.20]Oh
[70:46.20]I tried to get the blood out my hair.
[71:49.56]Come on!
[71:58.57]I can't even see.
[72:17.89]Alright, now don't walk off the edge!
[72:24.17]We're good.
[72:26.75]What does that do for us?
[72:31.90]She's like a grandma.
[72:33.32]Sorry, this is not a granny-like.
[72:39.06]Um...
[72:47.05]What am I supposed to do?
[72:52.35]I was at... Oh.
[72:53.78]Whatever.
[72:54.08]Interesting.
[73:21.80]Bonzi, buddy?
[73:51.52]Ah, okay, so now I can use the train.
[73:53.16]Sorry, tram.
[73:56.86]How do I use the tram?
[74:02.63]Hello?
[74:02.89]Did I turn it on?
[74:10.59]Okay, this guy, whatever.
[74:11.75]R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[74:44.25]So what are we doing?
[74:46.81]The light-
[76:27.65]I woke up early.
[76:29.67]Here it comes.
[76:30.47]Alright.
[76:41.14]How many bullets?
[76:53.62]There's no bullets in this gun.
[77:24.21]This is Lace.
[77:24.97]The other one's Jasper.
[77:26.23]They jumped me in the forest, put me in an old freezer, kept me in a fucking cage.
[77:30.83]I'd be dead if it weren't for you.
[77:31.81]Thanks for getting me out.
[77:33.71]Sorry for all the blood.
[77:37.51]You're welcome?
[77:37.99]I need to get back home.
[77:39.80]Do you live in Texas?
[77:40.86]We're in Texas?
[77:41.56]No, I'm from Botofgal.
[77:43.94]You probably haven't heard of it.
[77:44.80]It's a small little village in the forest.
[77:47.16]Maybe you've heard of the Botofgal Orienteering Gathering.
[77:51.30]You have a car?
[77:52.18]Can you give me a ride?
[78:11.94]that's weird oh here we go I woke up early this morning trying to get the blood out of my hair
[78:23.53]cranking up the sound on my hi-fi out the screen downstairs smiling along to my memories of what we've been loved to my brother and I were laughing when I
[78:54.06]We know the lyrics.
[78:54.68]What the fuck?
[78:55.12]I don't want to sing this part.
[79:21.79]Brought her back to Texas.
[79:26.18]Gave her a nice little cage.
[79:29.36]I'm not singing this part.
[79:30.96]After the closing hours.
[79:34.54]I'll give the gun to place.
[79:40.99]A jolly time at night.
[79:45.15]When it's time to end her life.
[80:09.38]That was good.
[80:11.86]My mic just freaked out.
[80:17.45]Is there anything else?
[80:32.68]So they were singing karaoke about a crime they committed.
[80:35.66]And I went to rescue the girl.
[80:38.54]That's crazy.
[80:40.85]That was a good one.
[80:41.59]That was good.
[80:48.97]Alright.
[80:50.37]I think I'm gonna call it here.
[80:55.10]That was a fun night of games.
[80:56.84]It's great to see Vinny and the guys, right?
[81:03.94]The next time you see me will be on Halloween night.
[81:06.20]Or Halloween day.
[81:10.50]Actually, what time will it be?
[81:12.32]I think it's going to be 12 p.m.
[81:13.42]Eastern.
[81:15.50]I will be on Charlie's cooking show.
[81:18.39]Tell me time.
[81:21.19]Should be fun.
[81:23.77]So I will not be live on this channel, but go to Charlie's channel on Halloween.
[81:30.39]Should be fun.
[81:30.99]I'm looking forward to it.
[81:33.25]And for horror games, I am not big on granny likes.
[81:37.24]I'm not very good at them.
[81:39.58]I'm very jumpy and I have pay attention problems.
[81:44.16]The granny likes destroy me.
[81:47.62]But they're still fun.
[81:49.92]I still had a lot of fun.
[81:50.74]It was a great night of games.
[81:53.22]I will see you guys on Halloween.
[81:55.20]Please go watch the Critical.
[81:59.44]Yeah, Charlie Critical.
[82:03.35]Is Charlie live right now?
[82:05.15]We could just raid Charlie.
[82:07.55]Is he live?
[82:13.92]He's doing some YouTube stuff.
[82:16.14]Well, go say hello.
[82:17.92]So, it should be a fun time.
[82:19.54]Halloween day.
[82:20.18]See you guys soon.
[82:20.80]Thanks for watching.
[82:21.50]Have a great night.
[82:27.05]See you on the 31st.
[82:31.77]And go say hello to Charlie.
[82:37.43]I'm gonna go take a bath.
[82:38.25]I'm sweating.
[82:38.79]I'll be really honest with you.
[82:42.04]After the... I think after about hour number four or five, after screaming like a thousand times, I kind of... I kind of ran out of gas.
[82:51.96]I got scared so many times tonight that I think I ran out of gas after like hour number five and a half.
[83:03.69]You would... Okay.
[83:05.68]When your body screams like that, like... It just drains you so physically.
[83:11.80]It's so... We can tell.
[83:16.56]I wanted to stick it through for a couple of these, though, because they are really fun.
[83:22.68]Alright.
[83:22.90]Let's say hi to Charlie.
[83:25.90]Good night, guys.
[83:26.50]See you on the 31st.
[83:29.32]Have a wonderful rest of your evening, whatever is left of it, or good morning if you're just waking up.
[83:32.91]It's pretty late for a lot of you.
[83:35.85]See you soon.
[83:38.02]Also, check out GrottoBeasts.net.

[83:54.90]Okay, let me get it ready.
[84:05.30]Alright.
[84:05.86]Go say hello to Charlie.
[84:07.54]12 noon, I believe, on the 31st.
[84:14.14]He'll probably be able to update that.
[84:15.81]Follow his Twitter.
[84:16.59]Make sure you're aware of it.
[84:19.17]That will be where the most up-to-date information will be.
