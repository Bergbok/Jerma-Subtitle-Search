[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.36]On a fucking iPhone.
[00:10.01]Am I even live right now?
[00:11.87]I might be.
[00:12.35]On my shitty iPhone.
[00:17.37]I can see the chat too.
[00:18.23]That's good.
[00:20.42]I'm like right up in your face tonight.
[00:22.98]Where's the camera?
[00:23.62]Right here?
[00:24.18]Right there.
[00:24.52]Okay.
[00:26.72]Well, you're... Oh, no, no.
[00:28.74]I can't talk yet.
[00:29.44]I need to wait until everybody's here.
[00:33.42]This is going to be like a 15 minute stream because data.
[00:37.63]Ooh, I'm going to be spending money on data.
[00:42.93]This is where, I don't like this.
[00:44.65]I don't like this setup.
[00:45.45]I can like see myself and I get the chat.
[00:48.03]I'm like, can you hear me?
[00:50.26]Can you guys even hear what I'm saying?
[00:53.96]How shitty is this quality?
[00:55.08]Is this, is this like 2G?
[00:59.10]You can hear me.
[00:59.60]Okay, good.
[01:01.50]Finally, I'm at least able to stream on my dogshit device.
[01:06.06]Is it like 240p?
[01:06.62]It's probably worse than that.
[01:10.77]It's probably like 60p.
[01:12.15]It makes me look really old.
[01:19.11]Whatever.
[01:21.53]Where are my stats?
[01:22.95]Oh, there we go.
[01:23.55]They are my stats.
[01:24.97]I can see you guys now.
[01:29.85]So, we still don't have internet.
[01:33.30]Our house is currently in a total... We got nothing.
[01:37.77]We've got another line that's come on in and... Still doesn't work.
[01:45.31]So now, there's a whole other scenario here where they have to do a lot of work.
[01:50.60]This is why I'm coming to you from the phone.
[01:54.08]And that kind of segues into the next topic here, which is because...
[02:00.02]I don't know when I'm going to be able to stream from this office.
[02:04.50]Let me get you guys to where you're used to, right?
[02:08.10]Hold on, here we go.
[02:09.66]See?
[02:10.48]It's like there's no difference.
[02:13.58]See?
[02:13.94]You can see my office in the door like last time.
[02:17.97]But, yes, it's an office.
[02:20.49]It's a goddamn office.
[02:22.11]Because it's not my bedroom.
[02:23.05]It's another room that's used for the purposes of streaming.
[02:27.74]But, no, this is gonna hurt my arm.
[02:29.72]We're gonna do this.
[02:31.38]That hurts my hand.
[02:33.23]That hurts my fingers.
[02:34.11]There we go.
[02:36.73]So I don't know, I have no idea when we're actually gonna be able to reliably stream from this place.
[02:42.71]So what that means is that means I've decided to do something that we've been talking about for a long time, and that is the green screen stream.
[02:51.23]Remember that?
[02:51.73]Remember I was gonna get in front of a green screen, I was gonna go to a green screen studio and do all that shit?
[02:57.04]Well, that's now happening much sooner than you think.
[03:00.04]So let me break down how this is gonna play out as you count the fucking neck rolls.
[03:06.96]How many neck rolls do I have now?
[03:17.87]When did that happen?
[03:19.63]What the fuck?
[03:20.45]When did I get like a turkey neck?
[03:23.07]Like a turtle?
[03:24.50]Whatever.
[03:24.82]Nobody even cares.
[03:25.90]You're not even going to look at it.
[03:27.30]Well, now you are, because I just said it.
[03:29.32]Anyways, so... The purpose of this stream is to kind of pad the time still to be able to actually livestream.
[03:38.11]So, what's going to happen is... I'm going to say it, and it's good.
[03:43.15]I gave the mod some warning here.
[03:45.49]But the Discord is going to open up here with a new channel.
[03:50.67]And on that new channel...
[03:53.20]is going to be stalling.
[03:55.38]Well, I can't stall.
[03:56.96]I'm on like G right now.
[03:59.34]I'm going to get a call from my provider and they're going to be like, oh yes, you used like 16 minutes of 240p data.
[04:04.62]That'll be $400.
[04:07.43]I'm going to be like, whatever.
[04:13.17]So in the Discord, there's going to be a new channel.
[04:15.49]It's going to be action recommendations because what we talked about before is
[04:21.27]long time ago, months ago, when I first wanted to do this idea, I'm going to get in front of a green screen in a professional studio.
[04:29.03]Not just like, oh, I'm going to put a green screen behind me.
[04:30.77]No, it's going to be like a 50-foot space.
[04:34.03]And I'm going to be able to do anything.
[04:35.95]We're talking... I'm not going to give you any ideas.
[04:39.60]What you guys are going to have to do is come up with about 30 of them, 30 actions that you want me to do.
[04:46.52]It's going to be a nomination process.
[04:47.82]The mods are already aware.
[04:50.06]And I'm not going to see what they are.
[04:53.40]So you have, depending on how long it takes for us to get the internet fixed, I'm going to try to do this within the next three or four days.
[05:06.45]So that gives you at least a couple days to nominate some actions, which, by the way, I get three vetoes.
[05:13.13]Mm-hmm.
[05:14.15]So just remember that I get to veto at least three of these fucking things that you want me to do out of like 30.
[05:23.09]So you better get good ones because I'm going to have a big rubber stamp that's going to be like, bang, I ain't doing that.
[05:30.83]But that's going to happen starting tonight and into tomorrow and the next day.
[05:34.66]And then I'm going to that studio and I'm going to broadcast from the studio.
[05:39.90]So that's the plan.
[05:41.52]Now,
[05:42.25]Before we continue, why are we at 280p?
[05:45.49]Because I'm on an iPhone on like shit internet.
[05:51.33]I'm on an iPhone right now.
[05:53.43]There's no internet in this.
[05:54.83]I don't have any internet.
[05:56.45]It just doesn't work.
[06:02.00]I'm turning red.
[06:04.06]You said the word internet.
[06:06.42]No, I did.
[06:07.30]I said the word internet and I just got red.
[06:11.47]Anyways.
[06:13.24]So... I'm gonna get to veto three of them, but let's go over rules.
[06:17.56]Let's go over a couple of important things, because I know how deeply this could go totally south.
[06:25.44]What do I mean by that?
[06:27.62]All the mods have... They're going to delete submissions that are sexual.
[06:33.14]You know, no sexual bullshit.
[06:35.18]Yeah, I'm not gonna do any...
[06:37.17]Anything in front of a green screen where you can do, you know, I'm not going to happen.
[06:42.30]So use common sense with what you'd like me to do in front of a green screen because they're going to get picked out.
[06:48.80]Uh-oh, am I dropping?
[06:51.42]Am I dropping frames on my iPhone's frame?
[06:59.36]I just was for a second.
[07:01.66]But yeah, so just use common sense.
[07:05.56]Like, I ain't gonna do anything, like, fucked up in front of that green screen for you to then, like, oh, let me, like, dude, let me put him here.
[07:13.26]Look what he just did.
[07:14.86]I mean, that's the purpose of the whole thing.
[07:17.02]I mean, but I'm talking, like, in, like, a bad sense, right?
[07:22.02]Because what's gonna happen after that is after three or four days, I'm gonna do the stream, we're gonna do all the actions, and then I'm going to put on a host site
[07:35.67]Or I might not even have to.
[07:36.55]We'll see how the quality is.
[07:39.69]The footage, right?
[07:40.55]If you guys don't want to pull it from the stream itself, then I'm going to put up probably raw footage somewhere.
[07:46.61]And then it's you guys get to make whatever you want as long as it is okay.
[07:53.68]You know what I'm saying?
[07:56.20]And we're going to have a community event a couple weeks later where we watch them all on stream.
[08:01.78]All of them are going to get processed.
[08:03.44]Mods are going to watch them to make sure, like I said, no, nothing's going to slip through the cracks here.
[08:08.76]So, we're going to watch it.
[08:10.48]No, it doesn't need to be like PG-13.
[08:13.96]You can do some R-rated material, like, you know, but nothing, no, like, bullshit.
[08:18.73]Do you know what I mean?
[08:19.37]And you know exactly what I'm talking about when I say that.
[08:21.67]I don't even need to explain what that means.
[08:24.79]No bullshit, okay?
[08:26.63]Use your goddamn common sense.
[08:33.02]Yes, people, you guys get it.
[08:35.42]You guys get it.
[08:36.64]But anyways, we're going to do a big community event where we watch them and we watch what you guys have decided to do with the green screen footage.
[08:43.35]There's going to be like, probably like an hour of green screen material.
[08:48.47]I look forward to what you guys do.
[08:50.67]Eye contact stream?
[08:51.51]Well, it's because it's right here.
[08:53.38]Would you rather me look over at the chat?
[08:54.62]Because that's what I could do too.
[08:58.36]Free material?
[09:00.64]No, I mean, well, look, look, look.
[09:03.40]When- the reason why this is an interesting idea is because all this shit that you guys were doing with the bee stuff like the wasp snapping and everything.
[09:12.40]There's some creative fucking people in this community and I'd like to see it actually flourish - you know not just like: Oh there's me and I'll put a bee here.
[09:22.00]I think that's really interesting to see what people will come up with and we're going to do a whole event we're going to watch them all.
[09:28.00]So, again, the Discord is going to open up with a new channel.
[09:33.78]All the suggestions go there.
[09:35.04]I'm not going to read them.
[09:36.00]I'm not going to see them.
[09:37.80]I will not know what they are until I get the piece of paper at the studio that I go to.
[09:42.47]And again, I get my big stamp that I'm going to stamp out ones that I don't want to do, three of them.
[09:48.09]So I wish I could give you an example here.
[09:52.46]But if there's a certain...
[09:55.65]By the way, let's make this rule very, very clear as well.
[09:59.07]If there are no doubles, no doubles are going to be allowed here.
[10:04.69]So if you put down, let's say, I don't know, like six or seven different dances.
[10:12.15]I don't know.
[10:14.38]And they're all the same.
[10:15.36]Like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:17.78]You know, doubles, they got to be all unique or I'll fucking veto.
[10:22.26]I'm just going to veto them all.
[10:27.12]You want to see this motherfucker do a dance?
[10:32.50]You bet your ass you better come to a consensus on it.
[10:35.68]Because I'll veto that shit.
[10:39.40]I'm already not looking forward to it.
[10:40.64]And I already just gave you the idea.
[10:44.67]I ain't doing it.
[10:45.97]Just already know that that's going to get vetoed.
[10:48.19]That's like an automatic veto.
[10:52.15]You better have some better shit on there because I get three vetoes.
[10:57.78]Do a default dance.
[11:02.80]Default dance.
[11:04.38]Well, what even is a default dance?
[11:08.54]So no stream tonight.
[11:10.60]Well, no.
[11:12.51]Unless you count this.
[11:13.93]Which I wouldn't because it's just a quick little thing.
[11:15.93]I just wanted to make sure that I got people aware of what's happening.
[11:20.23]And told people, you know, what's going on.
[11:23.61]Because...
[11:24.78]You guys have waited at least three weeks, two or three weeks or so for me to come back.
[11:30.12]And it's like, hey, I'm back.
[11:31.24]No, I'm not.
[11:31.86]Just kidding.
[11:34.26]So I want to do something fun.
[11:36.30]While the internet's out, because I'm not going to be using my internet.
[11:40.04]I'll be in the studio.
[11:40.78]I'll be streaming from there.
[11:42.44]So in the next...
[11:44.71]Two days or so, try to come to a consensus over the next 48 hours of what you'd want me to do for actions.
[11:51.62]Somewhere around, I've already talked to the mods about it, so somewhere around like 25 to 30-ish dances.
[11:57.80]I mean, not dances, no.
[11:59.88]I mean, 25 to 30 actions.
[12:02.83]25 to 30 actions.
[12:05.53]Just gonna put every single Fortnite dance.
[12:09.55]But that's not going to happen because that would be counting as a double.
[12:12.77]If there's a Fortnite dance on there, it's getting vetoed.
[12:15.42]Fuck it.
[12:15.74]Let's just say it.
[12:16.82]And if you put like 20 Fortnite dances on it, it doesn't double.
[12:22.62]So that doesn't count.
[12:23.62]You're not going to be able to do that.
[12:25.65]So it's just getting fucking vetoed.
[12:27.91]You know what?
[12:28.85]Let's just go with this.
[12:29.63]Don't even put Fortnite on the list because I'm not doing it.
[12:31.81]I don't even do it.
[12:32.91]Pick something else.
[12:33.55]Do something better.
[12:35.75]It is double.
[12:36.33]It's the same area.
[12:37.97]It's the same spot.
[12:39.59]It's the same company that made the game and the same animating studio created it.
[12:48.84]I didn't want to say it, but I had to.
[12:54.12]Now, this is not epic.
[12:57.22]But, yeah.
[12:58.36]So, that'll be in the next few days.
[13:00.06]Come to a consensus on what you want me to do.
[13:02.15]And, by the way, if you do mention props, right?
[13:05.86]I'll give you an example of one that I would definitely wouldn't veto at all.
[13:08.98]Absolutely not.
[13:10.42]Jerma getting lost kayaking, right?
[13:12.90]Like, I mean, that's a fairly non-veto-able fun thing that I could do in front of a green screen with the whole kayak there and be like, oh, rapids, right?
[13:20.13]I mean, that's a pretty good idea.
[13:22.55]If there are props involved, I'm gonna need to know, right?
[13:24.83]Like, I'm gonna need to know what props.
[13:28.47]So if you do wanna include props, it's gotta be something that I can obtain that's not gonna cost a shitload of money because if it is, I'm gonna have to improvise.
[13:38.94]Are they going to... What?
[13:41.18]This chat is too small.
[13:46.42]I don't like being that close.
[13:49.56]Do a little action.
[13:51.56]Clown... That one would be tough.
[14:01.67]We'll see what you come up with.
[14:03.01]For the most part, though, try to keep it something I can do on my own.
[14:06.92]And if there's going to be a shitload of props, maybe the mods can get involved there and make it so I don't have to buy a bunch of fucking weird shit on Amazon.
[14:16.03]And even if I get two-day shipping, it's going to take me a couple days to get some of those props.
[14:21.29]But you'll see.
[14:22.37]We'll get it going.
[14:25.21]Any questions?
[14:28.31]People are subscribing and giving money and shit, and I can't even keep up with it.
[14:31.59]I'm so sorry.
[14:32.19]Thank you, everybody that came in here.
[14:35.57]You got questions?
[14:36.21]Okay.
[14:37.73]How you doing?
[14:38.21]I'm doing pretty good.
[14:39.13]That's a pretty good question.
[14:43.13]No questions.
[14:47.01]What's your favorite Fortnite dance?
[14:49.53]Oh, probably this one.
[14:52.91]I think it's definitely this one.
[14:54.39]Where the kid goes like... Right?
[14:57.33]Like the backpack kid.
[14:59.99]Something like that.
[15:03.63]Shit, I just did a Fortnite dance!
[15:19.78]I like, you like my ladder?
[15:21.64]That's because I can reach up there.
[15:22.96]You know what I'm saying?
[15:24.40]It's hard to put those up there.
[15:26.96]Well, you're not that, uh, I mean, look at how strong I am, though.
[15:33.28]Oh, come on.
[15:34.96]Give me a break.
[15:35.94]Give me a break.
[15:37.64]These ceilings are like 15 fucking feet tall.
[15:40.68]Even if you were 6'2", you wouldn't be able to get up there.
[15:45.15]It's like, the ceilings are fucking 30 feet tall.
[15:53.45]Ah, alright.
[15:55.67]Any real questions?
[15:59.84]I'm trying to think if I missed anything.
[16:01.92]Alright, let's break it down one more time, real quickly.
[16:05.92]No internet, still.
[16:07.32]It's getting resolved.
[16:08.42]It will be resolved.
[16:10.12]Soon.
[16:10.82]Hopefully.
[16:11.37]I have no ETA.
[16:12.83]Because of that, iPhone stream.
[16:15.59]Internet phone stream.
[16:16.75]iPhone stream.
[16:17.33]That's why I'm here doing this.
[16:18.83]iPhone stream.
[16:20.23]Uh...
[16:21.19]Because of that, streaming from a studio in probably three or four days.
[16:25.46]Studio stream.
[16:26.34]Green screen stream.
[16:27.78]Go to the Discord.
[16:28.60]Get your nominations in.
[16:29.68]Find out what you want me to do.
[16:30.60]30 actions.
[16:31.92]No bullshit.
[16:32.94]No dumb shit.
[16:33.78]I mean, well, no bullshit.
[16:35.52]You.
[16:36.36]That guy right there that said exactly what you wanted me to do right there.
[16:39.15]I'm not going to do it.
[16:39.81]Make sure you get that figured out.
[16:41.27]No bullshit.
[16:43.03]Come to a consensus.
[16:44.63]No doubles.
[16:47.63]And that's it.
[16:50.38]Are you actually... Am I a... What?
[16:56.28]House tour.
[16:57.66]No, I don't want you to know what's in my house.
[17:01.29]Here, I'll give you a tour.
[17:07.45]Let's just show you this, by the way.
[17:10.81]You see how... Do you see this?
[17:13.79]Do you think you can reach up there?
[17:16.33]This is a, this is a five foot ladder.
[17:19.37]So right now, right now I am like 15 feet tall.
[17:26.17]You see?
[17:27.55]Like the, I'm, I'm, the ceiling is still here.
[17:29.79]And look at this.
[17:30.47]My arm is like a good two feet.
[17:32.94]I'm five eight.
[17:34.46]This is five feet.
[17:35.54]This is like a 12 foot ceiling.
[17:37.18]You think you, you think you're so funny?
[17:39.34]Oh fuck.
[17:39.94]He's going to fall.
[17:42.56]Oh.
[17:44.65]Look, there's not much I can do with a phone in my hand.
[17:53.31]Alright.
[17:54.33]I'm glad we had this conversation.
[18:01.92]I'm not touring the house.
[18:03.44]There could be shit over there that I don't want you to see.
[18:05.50]I don't know.
[18:08.16]I don't like house tours.
[18:09.50]I don't know why people do that.
[18:11.81]Okay, well, let's go ahead.
[18:14.05]Over here, hey, that's where I sleep every night.
[18:17.63]That's right in that bed.
[18:18.85]Oh, there's like underwear on the ground.
[18:20.27]Let me just move that out of the way.
[18:22.26]What's this?
