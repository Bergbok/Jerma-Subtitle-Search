[00:08.79]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.41]Jerma here with Pit Fighter.
[00:13.65]This is gonna be one of those games that's old, it's in that same category of, like, the Pac-Man games I played, and the other weird, like, what-the-hell-is-this-game type of series...
[00:23.87]And I can't even explain this game.
[00:25.69]It's atrocious.
[00:26.69]It's so stupid.
[00:27.39]It's a fighting game.
[00:28.73]It's supposed to be, in quotes, a fighting game.
[00:31.25]But it's one of the worst games, like, ever made.
[00:33.61]And you're going to see why very shortly.
[00:35.23]I hope you guys enjoy it.
[00:36.53]Live commentary is going to kick in right now.
[00:38.43]Just want to do a brief introduction to it.
[00:40.15]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[00:41.45]And of course, take care, everybody.
[00:43.27]Even though I think I say that again in the end of the video.
[00:45.37]But anyways, we'll say it twice.
[00:46.37]Take care, everybody.
[00:47.07]See you soon.
[00:47.71]Bye!
[00:48.70]Okay, so here we go.
[00:50.14]We have the choice of being Buzz, the ex-pro wrestler.
[00:54.10]He's 6'2", 226.
[00:56.06]Body slam, headbutt, piledriver.
[00:57.70]He's got a couple of moves there.
[00:59.62]Ty, the kickboxing champion.
[01:02.02]5'11", weight 186 pounds.
[01:04.43]Agility-based fighter.
[01:05.61]Spin kick, flying kick, and roundhouse kick.
[01:08.31]Or we can be Kato, the third-degree black belt from the five-foot-nine.
[01:13.39]You know, none of this matters.
[01:14.53]There's only three people you can choose from.
[01:16.95]It doesn't matter who you pick.
[01:18.51]You could pick any of these guys, and the exact same thing's gonna happen.
[01:22.02]You ready?
[01:25.48]You see, the best part about this game is it has some of the most beautifully rendered animations I've ever seen in my life.
[01:31.04]Take a look at how, like, the one or two sprites that were used to create the fantastic punching and kicking.
[01:37.05]What?
[01:40.11]I've never done that before.
[01:42.55]What the hell was that?
[01:43.55]I just, like, pancaked him.
[01:47.40]I'm gonna lose.
[01:49.12]It's very simple.
[01:49.68]There's like two buttons to this game.
[01:51.28]There's a punch, and there's a kick.
[01:53.16]And apparently there's a jump.
[01:54.16]Yeah, there is.
[01:55.14]That's just beautiful looking, by the way.
[01:58.61]Come here, you fat fuck.
[02:01.45]No!
[02:02.67]Look, your health's in the top left.
[02:04.89]I gotta beat this guy!
[02:06.81]I got five, he's got five.
[02:09.17]It's over.
[02:09.67]I lost.
[02:11.29]That was the game, by the way.
[02:14.55]Another really stupid thing that you're probably going to realize is each one of these guys has the same stupid sound when you pick anyone.
[02:23.76]I just picked this guy.
[02:24.98]Ready?
[02:25.20]Listen to this.
[02:29.10]Look at how much the crowd just looks like utter shit, by the way.
[02:32.00]I don't remember any crowd being like sepia-tone in my life.
[02:38.34]Alright, hold on.
[02:40.50]I might be able to pull this out.
[02:42.03]I'm able to pull this through.
[02:42.91]Ooh, do you see the little spin kick?
[02:48.85]This is like the tutorial.
[02:53.00]Oh, damn it.
[02:53.96]Damn it.
[02:54.38]Damn it.
[02:54.74]I got it.
[02:55.24]I got it.
[02:56.42]Alright.
[02:57.58]That's the first time I've ever beat that guy.
[02:59.78]So, that's a good thing.
[03:00.92]Why am I in a forklift?
[03:04.50]Alright, match two.
[03:05.16]You guys ready?
[03:06.62]Match two.
[03:08.60]Look at my health!
[03:12.52]Why did I start with that low health?
[03:26.69]Okay, I have 65 health.
[03:30.45]I'm gonna start the next fight with 65 health.
[03:34.71]That's... that's fucking bullshit.
[03:37.63]That is absolute, complete, utter crap.
[03:40.73]Look at, this guy has 260 health.
[03:43.57]This game is not possible to complete.
[03:45.97]You can't complete this.
[03:48.83]How would you ever be able to do this?
[03:51.95]It doesn't make any sense.
[03:52.89]It doesn't... make any sense.
[03:56.03]Why that would ever be a thing.
[03:58.47]Every fighting game I've ever played in my whole life, this is Street Fighter 1, this is Clay Fighter, that's like a staple of all fighters.
[04:08.68]Why would you ever remove that?
[04:10.40]Why would you ever not do that?
[04:12.32]Everybody starts with the same health when there's a new round.
[04:15.68]Why would you remove that from this game?
[04:17.99]That's what I don't get.
[04:19.03]I don't understand that.
[04:24.27]This game is so fucking stupid.
[04:30.73]I just wanna- I wanna get past the first two guys.
[04:33.06]Is that so much to ask?
[04:36.64]Who made this game?
[04:37.58]I don't even know who made this game.
[04:40.64]All I remember is playing it for Super Nintendo, and the arcade.
[04:43.62]This was in the arcades!
[04:46.37]How much money do you think people wasted on this game in the arcade?
[04:50.95]You probably had to throw like 30 bucks in the machine to be able to go past the first two guys.
[04:58.19]It doesn't matter what you do.
[04:59.15]It really doesn't.
[05:01.15]The guy with the cheap Halloween costume on is gonna beat you every time.
[05:05.79]Unless you get lucky, and you get him in a stun lock, you'll never beat this guy.
[05:12.66]I wonder if there are actual strategies.
[05:14.48]Did they make a strategy guide for this game?
[05:16.78]I wonder what the hell is in the... You open it up, and what does it say?
[05:19.58]Press all buttons!
[05:21.23]That thing!
[05:22.13]And then the book closes.
[05:25.83]Copyright 1991, THQ Incorporated.
[05:28.38]Toy Headquarters.
[05:31.28]What the hell?
[05:32.58]What does that mean?
[05:34.00]Toy Headquarters?
[05:36.74]To- Toys?
[05:39.46]I don't have any idea what that's supposed to mean.
[05:43.35]Yeah, this game is made by THQ.
[05:45.91]The Toy Headquarters!
[05:47.77]This is where Santa gets all his, like, fucking toys for Christmas.
[05:53.88]It's over, I'm dead.
[05:55.63]I'm using a controller, too.
[05:57.05]Can I, like, hack?
[05:57.97]Can I cheat to win?
[05:58.95]I wonder if I can use, like, cheats.
[06:01.39]Well, it's like the code I have to put in.
[06:03.89]Like, up, up, down, down, B, B, B, T, G, G, G, G, Y, Y, T, G. T. There's never been a controller with a T on it.
[06:13.99]This is the type of game...
[06:16.06]That you really, I really can't even imagine how this was even developed.
[06:20.90]This game is so broken and so awful, I don't even know how this game was even developed.
[06:26.41]What did they use?
[06:27.85]Did they use like a cereal box and a pen and paper to make this game?
[06:31.09]Like, honest to God.
[06:32.91]Honest to God, how did they make this game?
[06:35.78]They had some guy, like, take a couple pictures with his shirt off.
[06:39.42]And then they put, like, a couple Halloween costumes on.
[06:42.18]And then some guy took a fucking cereal box and started, like, drawing on it.
[06:46.10]And then they, like, jammed it in a computer and, like, mashed on enter until the game was, like, until, like, this popped out.
[06:53.07]They stuffed it in the CD drive.
[07:02.28]The elbow's working!
[07:04.19]The elbow!
[07:05.69]Oh my god, did I just find, like, the strategy?
[07:07.31]Okay, I got 144 health!
[07:10.91]Okay, come on.
[07:11.79]I gotta beat the second guy with the elbow strat.
[07:15.61]Yeah, you made it.
[07:16.27]Let's go.
[07:17.25]I don't care.
[07:18.13]Elbow strat.
[07:20.85]Elbow strat's gonna kick this guy's ass!
[07:24.51]Yes!
[07:25.13]Yes!
[07:26.33]Yes!
[07:29.44]You can't fuck with the elbow strat.
[07:33.91]It's working.
[07:35.71]I'm gonna beat this guy, I'm gonna beat this guy, I'm gonna beat this guy.
[07:38.31]Come on, no!
[07:39.33]Come on!
[07:43.47]Come on!
[07:44.95]Yes!
[07:45.59]Yes!
[07:46.43]I did it.
[07:46.75]That's the second guy, that's the second guy.
[07:49.83]Alright.
[07:54.32]89 health.
[07:55.26]Bring it on.
[07:57.72]Grudge match?
[08:00.17]What?
[08:02.36]What?
[08:11.40]Alright, well apparently I hit you more times than you hit me, I know.
[08:16.06]What the hell is this?
[08:16.86]Alright, here we go.
[08:20.19]Let's go, man.
[08:21.27]What?
[08:21.93]It's something like lady.
[08:22.77]Just stick to the elbow strat.
[08:25.25]That's the only thing that matters.
[08:27.89]As long as you do the elbow strat with the kickboxer, you're going to win.
[08:31.67]Or you're going to get stunlocked and instantly... It's over.
[08:34.82]I lost.
[08:35.12]Nah, it's over.
[08:39.52]If you think I'm going to start over again and do this all again, you're out of your mind.
[08:45.77]And what's with the money?
[08:47.56]What is with the money in the top left?
[08:48.96]I don't understand.
[08:49.52]Like, I have $12,000.
[08:52.04]There's no upgrade system.
[08:53.78]There's no... There's nothing.
[08:55.88]It's just, like, points.
[08:57.22]That's points, and they put a dollar symbol behind it.
[09:02.06]Whatever.
[09:02.40]I'm done.
[09:03.62]I'm done playing this game.
[09:07.14]That's Pit Fighter, guys.
[09:10.28]One of the dumbest, worst games I've ever played in my life.
[09:13.05]But I'll see you guys all next time.
[09:14.21]Thanks so much for watching.
[09:15.33]Take care, everybody.
[09:16.09]See you all soon.
[09:17.49]AHH!
