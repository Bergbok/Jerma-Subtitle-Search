[27:51.96]What?
[27:55.04]AI mode default.
[27:56.56]HP multiplier.
[27:59.12]I don't think I can do anything about it.
[28:01.04]It's before you place it.
[28:02.36]Oh, okay.
[28:03.56]So we'll do HP multiplier 5.
[28:06.77]The big ones.
[28:09.05]Okay.
[28:09.57]HP multiplier 5.
[28:10.63]Attack multiplier 3.
[28:11.79]The big guys.
[28:13.25]Okay.
[28:13.37]Okay.
[28:22.06]I- I'm not- I'm not remaking these guys, so that's too bad.
[28:24.44]We're just gonna make, uh, polar bear.
[28:28.29]HP multiply of 5, alright.
[28:34.85]Modern mammals.
[28:36.23]Okay, polar bear.
[28:38.02]Alright.
[28:38.88]It was a moderately size- it was- what, it was a 1.1, right?
[28:40.90]2 and 2.
[28:41.16]It was 1 point- it was 1.1!
[28:48.74]It was 1.1!
[28:52.35]What was it?
[28:52.71]1.1 or 1.2?
[28:53.48]It was 1.1.
[28:58.86]That's fine.
[28:59.20]Alright.
[29:01.58]Now let's go over here.
[29:02.60]Let's change these guys.
[29:09.37]Five.
[29:10.77]Three.
[29:11.03]Okay.
[29:20.00]Now I need the three little triceratopses.
[29:35.14]What were they, .3?
[29:35.90].2 or .3?
[29:36.68]And these guys are gonna be 2 with attack multiplier 1.
[29:43.60]Because there's more of them.
[29:48.49]That's fair.
[29:48.81]It was .3, okay.
[29:51.17]Oh fuck, this is the wrong team!
[29:52.65]Okay.
[29:57.57]Who will win?
[29:58.25]No refunds.
[30:00.31]You know what I'm doing, I'll get it right.
[30:01.87]Team 2.
[30:03.94]I got team two.
[30:04.64]Alright, team two, team two, team two, team two.
[30:06.32]Five, three.
[30:16.37]Alright.
[30:16.71]Are you ready?
[30:19.75]Alright, team one.
[30:24.05]I want to see team one.
[30:28.87]Team two.
[30:29.99]Team one.
[30:34.23]Alright, are you guys ready?
[30:41.84]In 3... 2... 1... Action!
[30:53.00]Team 1 kinda got... Wait, hold on a minute!
[30:59.43]It's still a fight!
[31:04.82]Shit.
[31:06.36]This is so stupid.
[31:08.93]The polar bear died instantly.
[31:10.41]Why?
[31:12.47]Oh, wait.
[31:13.01]It's anybody's game right now.
[31:15.70]It's the scorpions versus the broncosauruses.
[31:18.40]Oh, team two wins.
[31:34.77]It wasn't even close.
[31:35.65]Alright, how about this one?
[31:38.23]A Tetrazyrus.
[31:40.23]A gigantic Tetrazyrus with attack multiplier of 10.
[31:46.55]And health multiplier of 10.
[31:49.13]Versus... Fucking 5,000 snakes.
[32:26.84]It's gonna do one stomp?
[32:28.26]I don't think it's gonna be one stomp.
[32:32.36]Can I actually even fit 5,000 snakes on here?
[32:34.63]Alright, it's starting to lag.
[32:44.01]Oh man, it's lagging.
[32:47.95]30, 90.
[32:48.49]Omega low.
[32:50.45]Oh fuck, I can't do anymore.
[32:53.21]We'll say three, um...
[32:59.92]I can't do that much more.
[33:09.19]How does 300 sound?
[33:14.78]I'm gonna overheat the 3090.
[33:15.70]Okay, 300 snakes is enough.
[33:27.37]Okay, I gotta get the camera somewhere where I don't have to move it because I'm not gonna be able to.
[33:30.25]Okay, here we go.
[33:38.98]Are you ready?
[33:42.62]Up there attack so it's fair?
[33:46.43]No, up there attack.
[33:47.41]Why?
[33:50.17]One, two, three.
[34:03.43]Is he just stepping on them?
[34:05.85]Shit.
[34:09.28]I can't tell who's winning.
[34:10.36]Are these all snake bodies?
[34:31.89]Some snakes are dead.
[34:33.07]I can't tell.
[34:33.79]They just look like a plate of ramen.
[34:44.64]A potato computer?
[34:46.04]No, I don't have a potato computer.
[34:47.88]My CPU.
[34:55.69]Oh god, my poor CPU.
[34:59.48]Um, I see, I see blood.
[35:02.24]He's too big for them to hit.
[35:05.87]Oh, what an epic battle.
[35:13.93]It's, listen to this big drop incoming.
[35:16.66]I think he killed them.
[35:21.82]I don't think this is gonna, this is gonna, yeah, this is gonna take a long time.
[35:28.31]He's not even attacking anything.
[35:33.02]Is nothing dying?
[35:47.77]Is there a fast forward?
[35:50.73]I smell smoke.
[35:56.51]That's funny.
[35:59.62]They're pushing it towards the edge.
[36:01.34]Wait, no, they're running away.
[36:02.08]I don't know what to do about this.
[36:10.81]Should we just call this one a draw?
[36:12.03]No?
[36:12.09]What do you mean, no?
[36:30.47]It's obviously not a draw.
[36:32.05]Yeah, well no one's really winning either.
[36:33.71]Although there is a big mess of snakes over there.
[36:44.31]They all died in the same spot.
[36:50.32]But there's a shitload of movement though.
[37:07.65]Are those dead or alive?
[37:09.31]I think those are dead.
[37:11.71]It's just a mat of hair from like the barber shop.
[37:18.86]Press H?
[37:23.64]H for health.
[37:26.99]Oh my fucking god, this is gonna take forever.
[37:36.73]They can't even hurt each other, guys.
[37:39.94]Refund.
[37:42.70]Refund.
[37:43.00]They can't even hurt each other.
[37:50.83]They can't hurt each other.
[37:51.73]Refund.
[37:54.10]Refund it.
[38:02.20]I can't end the battle.
[38:03.52]There we go.
[38:05.10]Okay.
[38:05.42]Good.
[38:07.38]Holy shit.
[38:08.06]Alright.
[38:08.28]Delete all this crap.
[38:14.70]Clear it.
[38:15.14]Clear it all.
[38:19.24]Okay.
[38:20.36]Wow.
[38:20.58]Alright.
[38:20.78]That's better.
[38:24.34]Okay.
[38:24.54]Let's do another one.
[38:26.60]How about... Let's do something easy, right?
[38:29.40]Something simple.
[38:32.34]I'm thinking Saltwater Crocodile.
[38:34.76]A little bit bigger than that.
[38:39.46]Let's do 2.0 scale.
[38:44.54]Crocodile would have a little bit more HP, I think.
[38:47.82]Let's go with 5.
[38:49.06]And then Attack Multiplier 2.
[38:50.64]Slow.
[38:52.18]Versus Komodo Dragon.
[39:02.42]Moto Dragon would be a little bit less HP.
[39:05.38]I think it would hurt a little bit, then it would hit a little harder.
[39:08.76]Okay, who wins?
[39:12.64]Moto Dragon or Alligator?
[39:25.43]You didn't apply the multipliers?
[39:28.53]I thought I did, didn't I?
[39:31.33]I didn't change the alligator.
[39:34.59]Alligator was five HP, but two attack.
[39:36.69]2.0.
[39:43.21]Yeah, all right.
[39:47.90]Which one is which?
[39:49.40]Team two is the Komodo dragon.
[39:56.72]Rock one was one attack.
[39:58.22]All right, here we go.
[40:04.82]Three.
[40:05.12]Two.
[40:06.94]Let's get a good view of this.
[40:07.89]I want like a fucking National Geographic view.
[40:14.37]Three.
[40:15.87]Two.
[40:17.53]One.
[40:17.67]Go.
[40:30.14]Oh, shit.
[40:32.26]Oh, the Komodo dragon's done for.
[40:36.88]What?!
[40:37.12]He won!
[40:58.92]Damn.
[40:59.58]Okay.
[41:03.26]Alright.
[41:04.36]Alright, let's do it.
[41:04.84]How about this, uh...
[41:08.47]Alright, okay, I'm gonna make two different animals.
[41:13.93]Let's do humanoid.
[41:14.71]Okay, I want, like, human legs.
[41:18.90]By the way, HP multiplier of 3, attack multiplier of 5.
[41:24.02]No, HP multiplier of 10.
[41:25.38]Is it gonna be kind of a human character?
[41:33.28]Big legs.
[41:36.35]Strong.
[41:37.13]Very quick.
[41:37.85]Fast moving.
[41:42.25]And we need some torsos here.
[41:43.47]Humanoid torso.
[41:52.84]It's like plate armor.
[41:53.90]Alright.
[41:54.20]Carnivore plate armor.
[42:00.20]Okay.
[42:02.38]Limbs.
[42:03.03]Let's go with wings.
[42:03.71]Wings.
[42:06.75]Yeah, like these big-ass bat wings.
[42:08.17]Okay.
[42:17.97]Oh, attack multiplier of one.
[42:19.21]Three.
[42:29.83]Okay.
[42:31.29]Now let's do a tail.
[42:34.77]Tail's a little bit weak.
[42:35.76]Attack multiplier 1 is fine.
[42:42.66]Okay.
[42:44.93]Now let's do arms.
[42:48.43]Limbs, let's do... I can sword hand.
[42:55.40]Yep.
[42:56.36]This one.
[43:06.69]Attack multiplier, by the way, this attack multiplier, five.
[43:14.53]And then I need a shield hand.
[43:19.61]Oh, fine.
[43:20.53]I'll just take a little random, like, weird claw.
[43:28.87]Attack multiplier, by the way, of zero.
[43:30.27]Okay.
[43:34.21]Okay.
[43:39.42]How are we going?
[43:39.94]Weapons.
[43:43.00]Isn't there a handgun?
[43:45.11]FPS weapons.
[43:49.95]Okay, is it going to be a handgun?
[43:52.87]Oh, a shotgun.
[43:58.19]That's available over here, by the way.
[44:01.85]Two shotguns are available to use.
[44:07.22]Fix the wings?
[44:07.76]What's wrong with the wings?
[44:19.91]Okay, this is... Okay, this is literally one of the monsters from Power Rangers.
[44:38.96]Big head?
[44:39.82]No, I don't want it to be too big.
[44:41.15]Stack multiply for the head is going to be 2.
[44:44.49]Because there's going to be a bite.
[44:49.52]Alright, you're kind of a Skeksie, that's alright.
[44:58.23]I think this one's ready to go.
[44:59.77]Any other accessories or armor?
[45:03.53]Hold on, can I put this on your head?
[45:15.84]No, I don't think I can.
[45:18.46]Alright, I can give you this.
[45:19.46]I have a trash can.
[45:22.20]And you can have little knee pads too.
[45:30.10]Okay.
[45:33.74]Not bad.
[45:37.75]You look good.
[45:39.21]How about gear?
[45:42.81]Ah.
[45:44.99]Decorations?
[45:55.03]Absolutely.
[45:55.51]Sunglasses.
[46:05.78]I don't think these are going to stay on.
[46:16.69]Okay.
[46:17.03]What about hats?
[46:25.80]A teen dinosaur in like a kid's cartoon.
[46:31.82]Alright, that's it for you.
[46:32.70]Good luck.
[46:35.38]I wish you the best of luck.
[46:37.69]Now we're gonna go over here.
[46:39.51]Team 2.
[46:43.17]Animal base.
[46:48.25]Carnivorous dinosaur.
[46:56.02]Okay, spin you around.
[46:58.46]I'm going to do, I'm going to say two of these.
[47:04.00]Which then will give a torso.
[47:07.42]Okay, let's do humanoid torso.
[47:12.92]Does this count as two people?
[47:15.28]Or can I fuse them together?
[47:16.10]Okay, I can't.
[47:21.28]I can't fuse them together.
[47:34.80]Alright, hold on.
[47:35.45]Weapons 1.
[47:36.03]Okay.
[47:42.91]Better idea.
[47:48.10]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[47:49.24]Stay back up.
[47:57.71]Stand up.
[47:58.49]Oh, God.
[47:58.91]Alright, I'm gonna redo it.
[48:01.66]I just want a torso with, like, a thousand, like, murder tentacles.
[48:10.15]Animal face.
[48:10.63]Alright, here we go.
[48:11.33]This is what I want.
[48:11.81]Okay, good.
[48:23.03]Now we want torso, humanoid, attack multiplier of one.
[48:33.76]Okay, that looks good.
[48:42.57]Don't fall over.
[48:43.15]Is it gonna fall over?
[48:49.72]Back multiplier of four for these.
[49:10.06]Is this fucking deranged?
[49:19.98]Why?
[49:20.30]Okay.
[49:48.10]Alright, the head's gonna be like a two.
[49:55.70]That looks... That looks... That does not look good.
[50:00.77]That does not look okay.
[50:03.63]I definitely can't put the head here.
[50:05.69]That's for sure.
[50:06.65]Because I was thinking about that too.
[50:09.26]That was the place I was going to put it.
[50:13.90]Uh...
[50:17.52]You can't do a snake.
[50:18.54]Okay, that's fine.
[50:26.73]Oh, is the elephant going to look just as bad?
[50:28.29]No.
[50:31.93]You're so immature.
[50:33.07]I didn't do it.
[50:33.94]I just stated it was possible.
[50:37.92]Alright, that's fine.
[50:38.54]Okay.
[50:41.42]Now, what about weapons and shit?
[50:42.38]Decorations?
[50:42.62]Decorations?
[50:49.80]Sparkles?
[50:50.28]We just have LEDs?
[50:55.48]Okay.
[51:06.55]God damn it!
[51:07.45]Oh, I'm fine.
[51:07.85]I just got so mad for no reason.
[51:25.36]No, he's gonna go in the back.
[51:26.12]Okay.
[51:36.93]Are you ready to place your bets?
[51:38.09]Let's remind everybody what team everybody's on.
[51:42.46]Team one... is... I don't remember.
[51:47.68]I actually don't remember.
[51:52.23]Team 2 is the cool radical dinosaur, I think.
[51:55.25]I don't remember.
[51:56.37]Nice third grade arts and crafts project.
[52:03.47]Team 1 is left?
[52:04.99]Are you sure?
[52:05.39]That's wrong.
[52:07.09]What?
[52:08.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[52:09.85]Team 1 is the rad dino.
[52:11.07]Let me just make sure.
[52:14.55]Alright, yeah.
[52:18.41]Team 1 is Rad Dino.
[52:19.93]Team 2 is Serious Sam Torso Guy.
[52:23.56]They're both pretty evenly matched, I think.
[52:37.53]Team 1 is over here.
[52:38.59]Team 2 is over here.
[52:49.68]Alright, you guys ready?
[52:50.60]Get a good view, pull it back a little.
[52:56.88]And three.
[52:59.06]Two.
[53:00.96]One.
[53:03.04]Let's go.
[53:09.44]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[53:13.83]Oh, he got him down, he got him down, he got him down!
[53:15.91]He got him down!
[53:18.13]He's got him down!
[53:21.79]Him on his back is bad.
[53:23.11]That's real bad.
[53:27.03]He's just stabbing him in the chest.
[53:30.95]Oh, no!
[53:33.23]Who won?
[53:33.73]Oh... Team two is the winner.
[53:41.44]That was close.
[53:44.64]Nobody picked up the shotguns.
[53:49.16]I mean, he did get stabbed with every spear tentacle in the head.
[53:55.76]Every single one landed in his head.
[53:57.50]It was over from the very beginning.
[54:05.65]Okay, so you know how this works, right?
[54:08.21]Team 2 moves on.
[54:12.21]Team 1 is eliminated.
[54:15.95]Now we bring in a new character.
[54:24.71]How do you guys feel about, um, let's just see if we can, how about Lava Golem?
[54:32.01]What do you think?
[54:35.53]You think he's got what it takes?
[54:37.82]Versus a fucking giant Lava Golem?
[54:39.30]What do you think?
[54:41.10]How confident are you in this?
[54:43.56]HP of 10, attack multiplier 5, that works.
[54:50.62]I wonder.
[54:54.77]He deserves upgrades?
[54:56.53]If he wins?
[55:04.39]No, I don't think so.
[55:06.60]Upgrade the winner.
[55:08.16]I don't think that's fair.
[55:12.02]That's J. HP.
[55:18.28]Starting HP.
[55:18.90]20,000.
[55:19.08]Holy shit, that's a lot.
[55:24.42]Okay, his HP multiplier has to be like 8.
[55:26.20]That's unfair.
[55:31.90]Okay, HP multiplier of 6, 5.
[55:36.63]And, alright, let's have, it's a little bit of a challenge.
[55:38.47]What do you think?
[55:46.31]Give the lava monster a gun.
[55:47.61]I mean, I would love to.
[55:57.54]I can't, like, hand it to him.
[55:59.07]I can just put it in front of him.
[56:02.35]The lava monster with a gun?
[56:06.61]Alright, so you got team one.
[56:08.95]Lava monster with a weapon available.
[56:14.43]Or... You've got the one that won last time.
[56:22.03]Hatchet?
[56:22.51]I don't think... I can't.
[56:26.18]Oh, they're only for your FPS character.
[56:27.84]Yeah, we'll have the health bars on this whole time.
[56:37.45]Lava monster needs a hat.
[56:38.67]That's true.
[56:58.40]All right Good luck In three hold on let me get a good view I'm gonna keep the health bars on so it's not a mystery Three two one action
[57:26.76]Oh, shit.
[57:27.77]Not looking good.
[57:29.99]He's got him up in the air, though.
[57:32.03]Oh, he's on the ground.
[57:32.83]Bad.
[57:33.13]Oh, he tripped.
[57:36.43]He tripped over him.
[57:37.37]He tripped over him.
[57:37.95]He's got him by the leg.
[57:38.79]He's got him by his leg.
[57:39.65]He's going to get him just because of the leg only.
[57:41.61]He's stuck in his foot.
[57:45.17]Oh, shit.
[57:45.71]He's going to win.
[57:48.28]It's going to be close.
[57:50.04]Oh, he actually beat him.
[57:51.16]No way.
[57:51.82]That was close.
[57:54.43]He got the tendril stuck in his foot.
[58:01.13]I did not think he was going to win that.
[58:06.82]You're eliminated.
[58:08.04]You're out.
[58:11.56]Okay.
[58:22.50]How about the knockout artist?
[58:24.40]Okay, how about King... King Kung?
[58:33.25]Okay.
[58:35.61]King... King... We know we need an attack multiplier of... HP multiplier of 7.
[58:39.89]Attack multiplier of 6.
[58:45.62]Okay.
[58:49.74]He needs upgrades.
[58:53.95]The winner gets the loser's hat.
[58:55.22]That's a great idea.
[59:22.44]Add weapons?
[59:23.48]I can't for these guys.
[59:30.01]No, I want sunglasses.
[59:30.83]I want a different hat, too.
[59:39.30]Give me a... Brown?
[59:50.04]I like the Santa hat.
[60:01.10]You already have a Santa hat.
[60:07.14]Put a crown for the king.
[60:08.36]After this, if he wins three in a row, he gets the crown.
[60:12.58]Alright.
[60:13.94]It's time.
[60:15.42]You guys ready?
[60:16.28]Team one is the gorilla.
[60:17.14]Team two is... I don't know.
[60:21.54]What should we name him?
[60:24.74]Guns and unit creator weapons two.
[60:28.43]Can they use these?
[60:31.99]Oh, man.
[60:32.77]Okay.
[60:33.79]Okay.
[60:35.21]Okay.
[60:38.21]Not for this one.
[60:44.43]I'm not going to throw a flamethrower on the chest right now.
[60:46.95]No.
[60:47.29]Not happening.
[60:54.37]Okay.
[60:54.57]You ready?
[60:55.86]Three, two, one, go.
[61:00.70]Well, that's a bad start.
[61:03.52]He can't even walk.
[61:07.40]Holy shit!
[61:10.08]Oh no, he's gonna drop him out of the arena!
[61:11.50]Wait a minute, is this a tie?
[61:12.70]Does that count as a tie?
[61:15.47]Who- I don't know who wins!
[61:16.63]Who- I don't- Who won?
[61:18.27]Who won?
[61:19.77]Does that count as a tie?
[61:21.57]I- It says I lost.
[61:27.35]So, technically, that's team two wins?
[61:30.12]It's a ring out.
[61:32.87]oh god team one lost yeah that's a ring out the monkey fell out first that's uh that we we watched it so a rematch all right we'll do a rematch and I'll give it to you this this way ready this is what we'll do
[62:05.71]We'll prevent that from happening again.
[62:15.60]How confident are you now still that the gorilla can take him on?
[62:18.36]Do you have confidence still?
[62:27.60]I'm not, I don't know.
[62:28.50]I'm not so sure.
[62:37.49]You think these walls can hold them?
[62:39.95]Yeah, I do.
[62:40.45]What does it look like so far?
[62:46.41]This is very skewed to team two.
[62:51.19]Do a cage match?
[62:53.83]We'll leave this for now.
[62:55.87]I'll do a cage match later.
[63:05.24]Who will win?
[63:06.94]It's insanely skewed.
[63:13.23]This, look at the, look at how, no confidence in the gorilla at all.
[63:17.47]Even with, um, the wall back there.
[63:23.80]This is, some of you guys have a chance to win big right now, and I mean big.
[63:29.28]Like, really big.
[63:30.42]Because if this happens, holy shit, some of you guys are going to get a major payout.
[63:33.87]Let's go.
[63:35.84]Three.
[63:36.52]Two.
[63:37.85]Wait.
[63:39.39]Hold on.
[63:39.63]It's still going.
[63:46.31]The gorilla sucks.
[63:47.43]I don't know.
[63:48.23]I'll take this one big punch to the face and it's over.
[63:54.56]One.
[63:55.82]Two.
[63:58.02]Three.
[64:02.02]Um...
[64:06.48]It's gonna happen again.
[64:08.36]He's gonna just fall out.
[64:11.36]He's still in, he's still in.
[64:13.70]He's still in it.
[64:14.30]Oh my god, he sucks.
[64:17.92]Holy shit, he's bad.
[64:26.08]He was really bad.
[64:27.96]Why is he, why can he not walk?
[64:31.90]Why is he having so much trouble moving?
[64:34.52]He was trying to go for this double axe handle move, and he couldn't even do it to anything.
[64:38.44]Alright, goodbye.
[64:47.25]He moves on again, and this time he gets glasses.
[64:58.07]I don't know if anyone's going to be able to beat him.
[65:01.11]He seems like, it seems too good.
[65:08.26]I can't put these on.
[65:18.10]This looks like I'm at the beach with my grandpa.
[65:20.89]They're just lying back in the lounge chair.
[65:23.41]We got here 10 minutes ago.
[65:25.35]They're just asleep already.
[65:27.05]And they wake up when it's time to leave.
[65:32.91]Okay.
[65:37.53]Those are Team 1 glasses?
[65:39.07]Oh, okay.
[65:40.53]Does that matter?
[65:49.62]Alright.
[65:51.02]It's time for another... Alright, this time I'm going to create something.
[65:53.74]We have to rival this because he can't stick around this whole time.
[65:56.80]This one's going to have a weapon.
[65:58.92]But I'm going to make it fair.
[66:18.96]Uh, I don't know how this works.
[66:32.03]Wrong team?
[66:32.61]Oh shit.
[66:32.93]Okay.
[66:35.99]Attack multiplier, 2.
[66:52.38]Machine gun.
[66:52.92]Attack power 2.
[66:53.68]Okay.
[67:10.59]Oh, shit.
[67:10.91]I needed to... Whoops.
[67:15.71]Fuck it.
[67:15.95]It's going to be just static on the ground.
[67:51.64]Okay.
[67:55.52]Alright.
[68:04.27]Anything else I want to do?
[68:06.59]Limbs?
[68:07.59]Okay, maybe I can fly.
[68:10.01]This can fly, motherfucker.
[68:10.99]Let's go.
[68:27.13]Okay.
[68:28.97]So it doesn't do that much damage, but it has a huge advantage.
[68:35.27]And it can't walk.
[68:36.75]Important to know.
[68:45.28]Press J. Some attached weapons have attack multiplier not set to 1.
[68:49.98]That's fine.
[68:54.31]Only 1,000 starting HP, though?
[68:57.43]Oh, this is really... Okay.
[69:01.07]Okay, so... This thing has 1,000 health.
[69:05.28]But will it just blow this guy away in five seconds?
[69:12.48]Raises HP.
[69:14.54]Can I even at this point?
[69:19.19]I don't know.
[69:19.65]I can't...
[69:25.59]It's too late.
[69:26.01]I already bet.
[69:28.93]Bets are already in.
[69:30.70]Look, okay, this is one of those scenarios where he's either going to surprise you, and he's going to die immediately.
[69:35.86]Or he has a thousand health, he's going to shoot him and miss like five times, and he's going to stab him in the head and die.
[69:39.81]Here we go.
[69:40.07]Ready?
[69:42.39]Three, two, one.
[69:45.03]Let's get a good view.
[69:46.41]Action.
[69:47.05]Action.
[69:58.83]Oh my god Wow Did the Tesla coil even do anything look at the wings He's gone and he gets to have his he had a funny hat on
[70:27.86]Damn, I didn't.
[70:29.02]Okay.
[70:30.95]Alright.
[70:32.39]So he gets his hat.
[70:47.78]More guns?
[70:51.28]Alright, we need a... Oh, that's team one.
[70:53.06]God damn it.
[70:57.75]Okay.
[70:58.27]How about... We have to dethrone this guy.
[71:01.15]Alright.
[71:01.33]Animal base.
[71:03.01]Wyvern.
[71:06.11]We're gonna do attack... Let's see.
[71:07.61]What is the attack multiplier?
[71:09.13]Starting HP 2,000.
[71:09.77]Okay.
[71:11.42]We're gonna do... This is gonna be tricky.
[71:13.46]HP multiplier.
[71:16.02]So he's gonna have... He's got 7,000 HP.
[71:20.96]Okay.
[71:22.20]No.
[71:22.36]You know what?
[71:23.02]We'll have him have more HP. 8,000.
[71:25.83]Well, hold on.
[71:26.37]Who will win?
[71:27.07]You don't even know who it is yet.
[71:31.51]Oh, wait.
[71:31.77]Team 2.
[71:32.13]Okay.
[71:38.35]You don't even know who it is.
[71:40.79]Why are you voting?
[71:41.45]Okay.
[71:47.29]Wyvern Body.
[71:50.36]We're gonna do with the intelligence of a fucking man.
[71:53.24]You know what I mean?
[71:54.45]This is tricky.
[71:55.05]This is where it gets weird for you guys.
[71:59.83]This is gonna have human intelligence.
[72:12.26]Take that off.
[72:13.36]It's too heavy.
[72:23.23]Okay.
[72:32.82]Oh, and what's that?
[72:43.01]Two plasma beam T-Rexes on his front.
[72:47.41]That do two attack multiplier times two.
[72:57.84]And he's got a flamethrower on his forehead.
[73:00.34]And this thing, by the way, this shit does fucking 10 attack multiplier.
[73:06.66]But it is really small.
[73:08.96]You gotta get in real fucking close for that one.
[73:10.46]And then we're gonna give him... That's it.
[73:24.52]That's it.
[73:47.67]Team 1 is Wyvern.
[73:49.09]Team 2 is our champion.
[73:55.15]Tail?
[73:55.51]No, no tail.
[74:01.87]I think you guys seriously underestimate the fact that he has a flamethrower on his head.
[74:04.65]That is a times 10 attack multiplier.
[74:09.09]If he gets in close, it's over.
[74:16.77]Where's his hat?
[74:34.34]I can't put that on him.
[74:35.00]Okay.
[74:36.22]That's the flamethrower.
[74:37.02]Yeah.
[74:38.88]That is the flamethrower.
[74:39.58]That's a good call.
[74:40.64]Alright, we ready?
[74:45.17]Good view.
[74:46.39]See all the action.
[74:47.07]Let's do it!
[74:53.09]Three, two, one, go.
[75:05.13]Okay, those are strong.
[75:06.49]Those are really strong.
[75:08.47]Those are very strong.
[75:10.05]I don't even know where he's flying.
[75:11.55]It's a victory lap.
[75:19.80]Okay.
[75:20.92]Well, that was, uh... Here's your new hero.
[75:29.39]Down goes the giraffe.
[75:31.37]Alright, let's get another contender.
[75:35.71]Say goodbye.
[75:37.23]Alright, team two.
[75:39.41]Let's see if he can handle one of the, uh... One of these.
[75:44.96]For instance, how about, like... Gorehammer.
[75:54.82]Gorehammer.
[75:56.26]Attack HP multiplier of ten.
[75:58.18]Attack multiplier of five.
[76:03.60]You think you can handle Gorehammer?
[76:13.94]Team 2 is Gorehammer Team 1.
[76:15.34]Let's take a look.
[76:18.28]That's pretty evenly matched.
[76:27.46]Gorehammer does not look that sturdy.
[76:31.33]I will make sure that everybody watching is aware of this.
[76:40.80]Gorehammer may not actually be able to move.
[76:43.62]I don't know.
[76:52.11]Okay.
[76:52.63]Gore needs ranged weapons?
[76:55.33]Well, you don't know that.
[77:00.11]I'm taking the odds on this one.
[77:01.71]Good luck.
[77:05.35]Look, I hope he runs in there and just hits the hammer down and kills him with a headshot.
[77:11.95]Alright, here we go.
[77:13.17]Actually, a lot of people are voting for it.
[77:16.33]Not really, though.
[77:21.23]Alright.
[77:22.27]Remember, team two is the gorilla.
[77:24.94]Oh, that's the previous one.
[77:26.04]Oh, okay.
[77:31.14]Ready?
[77:32.48]Three, two, one, go!
[77:39.65]He can only shoot those once.
[77:41.93]All he has to do is get the hammer over there and hit him one time.
[77:49.71]He's flying away.
[77:50.63]He's flying away.
[77:57.43]I have to nerf this guy.
[77:59.05]All right.
[77:59.28]Well, it's not over yet.
[78:11.03]Okay, that was fucking pathetic.
[78:14.41]That was pathetic.
[78:16.97]That was pathetic, but here we go.
[78:18.45]I'm gonna do you... I'm gonna make this really hard for you guys.
[78:21.67]Because I don't know what's gonna happen.
[78:24.15]So I'm gonna make it really hard for you.
[78:27.96]Team 2.
[78:30.50]HP multiplier of 10.
[78:31.40]Attack multiplier of 10. 2.
[78:40.85]2, 3.0 for the hammer.
[78:47.22]With 10, 10.
[78:47.96]Times 10.
[78:48.72]What do you think?
[79:01.88]If they can walk, it's going to be very interesting.
[79:18.62]The two, the hammer brothers.
[79:22.44]Make a 1.0 hammer so he can actually move.
[79:25.42]I think they'll be able to move.
[79:26.50]3.0, they were like 5.0 before.
[79:28.13]That's asking for a lot.
[79:39.47]We'll see.
[79:40.07]I don't know what's going to happen.
[79:40.98]If they can actually walk around this tall or this small.
[79:45.92]then the wyvern has a problem.
[79:50.91]They're already shaking.
[79:52.69]I'm not telling you how to bet.
[79:54.53]I didn't tell you what to bet on.
[79:56.97]I'm just here.
[79:57.75]I'm just them seeing this.
[80:00.07]I didn't tell you what was going to happen.
[80:04.75]Imagine voting gorilla.
[80:09.02]I mean, if it ends up happening, you guys are going to get a huge payday.
[80:18.37]Those are- Those are more than 10 to 1 odds.
[80:31.66]Alright, here we go.
[80:33.20]Good luck.
[80:34.92]20 to 1?
[80:35.28]3, 2, 1, go.
[80:36.88]They can fucking walk!
[80:42.97]Interesting!
[80:44.15]INTERESTING!
[80:44.83]OH MY GOD!
[80:46.55]It's over!
[80:50.82]He literally fell down.
[80:53.92]Wow.
[81:01.57]Wow, that's a payout.
[81:03.09]Team two wins.
[81:12.29]It took two hammer hits.
[81:13.33]8.2 million versus 1.3 million.
[81:23.46]Alright, so this is going to be... Now we're going to do... So these two are champions with 10-10 at 3.0.
[81:30.80]We know that, right?
[81:31.46]But let's make it a little harder.
[81:34.01]Let's do an actual battle sequence, right?
[81:39.49]We're going to do... What's the default for these guys?
[81:45.13]Just one, right?
[81:46.23]Werewolves.
[81:51.75]Let's do...
[81:54.10]What are the stats on you?
[81:57.54]650, 1, 1.
[81:58.12]Okay.
[82:03.13]Let's go like this.
[82:08.27]Werewolves?
[82:12.84]Let's do 1, 2, 3.
[82:16.02]Actually, you know what?
[82:16.68]Let's do HP multiplier times 10.
[82:31.53]10 werewolves versus oh shit look at that 10 werewolves werewolves versus most dangerous fucking animal in the world hippopotamus what's their scaling okay look at that
[83:03.28]versus five hippopotamuses.
[83:16.72]Five hippopotamus versus ten werewolves.
[83:24.82]Make it six?
[83:25.86]Five is too much?
[83:27.98]I don't know, man.
[83:30.82]I don't think so.
[83:31.56]I think five is fair.
[83:41.11]Do three team to make it wacky.
[83:42.65]I don't think you can do channel points that way.
[83:47.83]Do one horse-sized duck versus one duck-sized horse.
[83:51.23]Isn't it a hundred duck-sized horses?
[83:54.85]Team one is a werewolf.
[83:56.07]Team two is hippopotamus.
[84:04.76]You can just do a poll.
[84:05.64]Yeah, but there's no stakes.
[84:10.93]okay that was a quick vote here we go one two three oh shit oh he took two with him though they're dumping him they're just dumping off the edge some of these werewolves they they're smart they're intelligent oh god
[84:40.08]Got a fight going on over there.
[84:41.08]No, they just dumped him.
[84:43.40]This is going to be close.
[84:44.28]This is going to be close.
[84:49.23]He's taking 3v1 and 1v1 over there.
[84:51.65]What the fuck is he doing?
[84:56.75]He just jumped off the cliff on his own.
[85:00.84]What a fucking moron.
[85:02.06]Alright, well, he's gone.
[85:04.86]These two have to beat this hippo.
[85:11.03]Oh no!
[85:13.25]Fighting for his life on the edge.
[85:16.99]One mistake though when the hippo goes off.
[85:18.47]This is gonna be anybody's game.
[85:24.80]No, don't do it.
[85:25.92]Don't do it.
[85:31.06]Nice lunge.
[85:32.10]Oh, could the tables turn?
[85:33.27]Is he too heavy?
[85:33.91]I think he's too heavy.
[85:38.81]I think the werewolves are doing more damage.
[85:43.08]Oh, so long, King Bowser.
[85:46.49]Okay, this is bad news for the werewolves.
[85:56.59]Oh, no.
[85:57.27]Wait a minute.
[85:58.57]Wait a minute.
[86:00.49]Don't get cocky.
[86:01.51]Don't get cocky, hippos.
[86:02.69]Bad move.
[86:03.83]Get away from the edge.
[86:10.18]I'm telling you, he does more damage.
[86:13.22]They have to throw him off.
[86:14.26]That was why they were doing that.
[86:15.52]The AI was like, we can't win.
[86:16.78]We gotta throw him off.
[86:19.80]He's just clinging.
[86:21.52]Holding onto his leg and just biting his arm.
[86:25.39]Oh, shit.
[86:26.03]This is bad.
[86:26.51]Oh, shit.
[86:36.82]Uh-oh.
[86:37.38]He's going off.
[86:42.30]Yeah, he's getting gnawed on both arms and legs.
[86:44.92]It's over.
[86:45.42]He can't come back from this.
[86:47.58]It's over.
[86:53.53]Wait, we got some friendly fire here.
[86:54.75]Friendly fire.
[87:04.83]This is so stupid.
[87:13.00]Last ditch effort.
[87:17.42]He's gone.
[87:18.98]Hippos win.
[87:22.74]Yeah, if the wolves did not just jump off the edge for no reason, this would have ended a lot differently.
[87:31.07]Hippos win.
[87:36.87]All right, we need to do... We got to put them in a... Like, we got to block... We got to lock them in.
[87:40.75]Okay.
[87:41.81]Okay.
[87:43.53]We gotta lock him in.
[87:46.87]Fences.
[87:53.17]Wait.
[87:55.35]I can make houses?
[87:56.09]I can make a castle?
[88:05.72]Wait, what?
[88:09.74]I put a hippo in a castle?
[88:11.32]And then have a bunch of people try to conquer it?
[88:41.99]Oh, that's not gonna work.
[88:42.61]I think the team's tiny.
[88:50.46]Actually, I could probably do it.
[88:51.28]Do a tower.
[88:53.64]Okay, yeah.
[88:57.07]So, okay, we're gonna put a hippo up here.
[88:58.41]Alright, hippo's gonna go up here.
[89:14.59]Okay, one single hippo.
[89:15.57]Okay, easy, easy.
[89:20.10]Two hippos.
[89:25.06]Versus... How about, like... I don't know, like... Humans?
[89:34.87]Commando bow.
[89:36.17]Okay, versus a bunch of commandos.
[89:45.35]There's a bunch of tiny commandos.
[90:07.68]About like 500 little tiny commandos.
[90:18.54]What about your CPU?
[90:19.42]That'll be alright.
[90:24.61]Okay, never mind.
[90:25.39]250 tiny commandos.
[90:26.89]Okay, just kidding.
[90:27.55]200 tiny commandos.
[90:55.48]Okay, around 200 tiny commandos.
[91:05.56]Okay, they have 1500 HP.
[91:06.92]Their attack multiplier is 1.
[91:07.82]Alright, they have to storm the castle.
[91:12.97]Good luck.
[91:25.47]PowerPoint Andy.
[91:30.81]Give the castle a mortar.
[91:33.39]No, no, I don't think so.
[91:40.81]Teams are backwards?
[91:44.52]Oh, shit.
[91:45.38]Team 1 is... Oh, shit.
[91:51.94]Team 2 are the commandos, by the way.
[91:56.75]Yeah, team two of commandos, team one of hippos.
[92:02.15]Give the hippos crowns.
[92:04.39]Yep.
[92:05.75]Absolutely.
[92:06.17]Okay.
[92:24.48]And then I want my FPS avatar up here too.
[92:26.88]No, actually that's not going to work because I have to die.
[92:43.73]Alright, let's do it.
[92:55.42]Are we ready?
[92:58.82]Are we good?
[92:59.36]Are we ready?
[93:07.64]Alright.
[93:08.31]3, 2, 1.
[93:09.29]The commandos!
[93:22.71]It's compre-
[93:30.25]It wasn't attached.
[93:31.79]They're not gonna be able to get in here.
[93:33.01]Are they alive?
[93:52.00]They're in there.
[93:52.60]Yeah, they're stuck in here.
[93:55.37]They're slowly getting in.
[93:56.55]They're slowly getting out.
[93:57.19]They're getting out.
[93:57.59]They're getting out.
[93:57.99]They're getting out.
[94:12.96]Well, that didn't work.
[94:15.54]Mando's win.
[94:16.10]Okay, well, I think I screwed that up a little bit, but whatever.
[94:21.02]I gotta clear this whole thing.
[94:30.72]Clear it.
[94:36.94]Clear it.
[94:38.30]How do I clear this?
[94:44.87]Clear it.
[94:47.83]Set wind?
[94:49.83]Hold on.
[94:51.81]New landscape.
[94:52.39]Okay, yeah.
[94:55.32]Alright, coward coal.
[94:59.18]Can ten coward coals beat one angry Joe?
[95:03.68]We're doing defaults.
[95:13.97]Team one?
[95:22.63]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[95:22.83]Just one single angry Joe on team 2.
[95:24.55]What do you think?
[95:26.75]4 hours?
[95:52.62]Four hours.
[95:53.16]What do you mean four hours?
[95:55.62]Oh, and by the way, did I mention?
[95:57.02]Angry Joe has a fucking helmet on.
[96:12.56]Um, never mind.
[96:27.25]Alright, it worked.
[96:30.95]Angry Joe versus 10 cowards.
[96:41.47]I don't think the cowards even fight, if I'm honest.
[96:50.31]Cowards have a shield wall, though.
[96:51.61]That's... You're right, they do.
[96:58.81]Yes, left team, the coward is team one.
[97:00.85]Go with the baddest team two.
[97:12.00]They could push him off, that's true.
[97:13.52]He's in a really vulnerable position.
[97:21.66]Alright, here we go.
[97:22.26]3, 2, 1, go.
[97:28.11]The cowards don't even fight.
[97:36.79]Although, very important, he might walk him off the cliff.
[98:04.69]He fucking fell.
[98:10.53]You're really hoping for he falls off the edge here.
[98:17.37]It's still possible.
[98:18.27]Uh-oh.
[98:22.21]Big trip incoming?
[98:25.65]He has to do this ten times, I know.
[98:34.89]Oh shit!
[98:38.67]No, not enough.
[98:39.54]It wasn't enough.
[98:44.22]One slip up though and that's it.
[98:52.80]No, they can't even attack with their umbrellas?
[99:06.22]This is an easy win.
[99:07.75]Hold on.
[99:08.43]Don't just say that.
[99:09.37]It's still time.
[99:13.63]It's still time for a monumental mistake.
[99:26.49]This is a real tragedy for the coward crew.
[99:30.02]Hold on.
[99:37.06]No, it's over.
[99:38.10]This is just slaughter.
[99:43.25]It's just slaughter.
[99:58.96]What was the point of this fight?
[100:01.02]It was to see if 10 people could fight this guy and win.
[100:03.98]But they don't even fight.
[100:09.21]And I can't stop it because money is on the line.
[100:12.03]Channel point money is on the line.
[100:13.69]And if there was even a 1% chance that he trips and falls over the edge, I can't stop it.
[100:31.14]Oh.
[100:33.12]Nope.
[100:34.32]That's the last opportunity.
[100:36.31]Joe wins.
[100:41.74]Alright, new fight.
[100:43.10]This time... Let's do another hard one.
[100:53.41]We're gonna do... Berserker Gorillas.
[101:08.40]How about, you know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[101:14.15]Eight Berserkers.
[101:18.73]1.5 scaled Knockout Artist Gorillas.
[101:25.08]Two of them.
[101:27.10]2.0 Wolverilla.
[101:30.78]Goro the Giant.
[101:34.32]By the way, at 3.0.
[101:39.23]Can you not stand up?
[101:39.83]Okay.
[101:51.75]Wait, and you're gonna be ten, you're gonna be five HP?
[101:55.82]Two multiplier.
[101:56.64]Holy shit, he is fucking insane.
[102:02.90]Never mind.
[102:03.54]That's too much.
[102:09.49]Okay, that's better.
[102:13.47]We lost Wolverilla.
[102:15.37]It was 2.0, right?
[102:16.22]At default.
[102:16.70]2.0 Wolverilla.
[102:21.60]You stand over here.
[102:22.22]Alright, so that's Team Gorilla.
[102:26.50]Team 1.
[102:27.10]So Team 2.
[102:27.58]I'm going to throw you a curveball here.
[102:40.73]Bugs versus a bunch of bugs.
[102:42.27]Way more bugs.
[102:48.79]Giant praying mantis.
[102:52.07]And a shitload of spiders.
[102:56.25]Okay, praying mantis.
[102:58.99]At 2.0.
[102:59.11]I'm going to have to give you more multiplier there.
[103:05.01]Let's go 2.
[103:07.97]One more.
[103:08.17]Let's do three.
[103:09.57]With a two attack multiplier.
[103:15.12]Yeah, we'll do... No, no, no.
[103:16.04]You know what?
[103:16.52]Fuck that.
[103:16.90]How about one, five, five giant enemy spider?
[103:25.60]No.
[103:26.12]Twenty.
[103:27.96]Good luck.
[103:35.27]And then a shitload of little praying mantises.
[103:38.98]At default.
[103:42.45]Two, three, four, five, six.
[103:46.85]Why are they moving?
[103:48.67]Why are you moving?
[103:49.99]Stop moving.
[103:50.35]What are they moving for?
[103:50.99]Why are they moving?
[103:54.80]Stop moving.
[103:55.18]Okay, well, whatever.
[103:59.54]Six praying mantises.
[104:00.44]And... Are they attacking?
[104:05.12]Are they attacking?
[104:10.90]And then a bunch of little ants.
[104:12.36]I don't know why they're attacking.
[104:21.08]They're too small.
[104:21.94]Okay, hold on.
[104:22.76]Let me fix this.
[104:27.01]Alright, one medium-sized giant praying mantis.
[104:32.65]And then... Wrong team.
[104:39.92]Shit.
[104:52.06]Okay.
[104:54.22]Did I say one?
[104:54.80]I meant two.
[105:00.32]And then a shitload of ants.
[105:02.10]Tiny.
[105:03.18]We're talking like 0.2.
[105:03.66]We're talking like 50 of them.
[105:10.34]30 is fine.
[105:13.14]Alright.
[105:15.92]The spider is insane.
[105:19.10]No, they're on the right team.
[105:20.78]Although, look at this guy, though.
[105:22.20]I don't know.
[105:25.78]And one worm.
[105:27.11]All the way back.
[105:27.69]One giant worm.
[105:30.75]Two giant worms.
[105:32.57]And an extra gorilla.
[105:49.20]Get ready.
[106:01.65]I'm excited for this one.
[106:02.65]I don't know.
[106:03.95]I don't want to influence the vote, but I have what I would pick.
[106:05.85]I think we have to stay high up for this one.
[106:18.30]I don't think I can do very much camera work on this.
[106:27.20]Wow, alright.
[106:28.24]I was gonna say gorilla.
[106:30.94]Because we don't know if he throws things or not.
[106:33.35]He might, like, throw rocks.
[106:35.01]I don't know.
[106:37.25]Three, two, one.
[106:39.17]Beacon!
[106:39.53]Beacon!
[106:47.37]What the fuck are you doing?
[106:52.32]Why was he attacking that guy?
[106:54.70]Alright, I don't understand.
[106:56.22]They're too big.
[106:58.50]I think the spiders won, but what happened?
[107:02.10]Was he on the wrong team?
[107:05.54]Was he on the wrong team?
[107:11.46]No, he's on the right team.
[107:13.30]He just started swinging at him and slashing at him.
[107:25.37]Scimitar guy pulled an ant up.
[107:29.03]Oh, okay All right, we're gonna try this again with a more dialed back Goro the giant 2.0 2.0 Giant enemy giant enemy spider is gonna go to also to 2.0 Not no huge shit.
[107:51.02]It's impossible
[107:57.95]No, 3.0.
[107:58.77]I can do 3.5.
[107:59.21]4.0.
[107:59.23]3.5.
[107:59.49]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[108:14.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[108:19.67]Okay, good.
[108:20.83]That means I gotta... Team goddamn won!
[108:23.76]Ugh!
[108:34.63]2.0.
[108:34.65]Spin him around.
[108:37.95]And I want him 10-10.
[108:39.03]No, he's got 42 fucking thousand HP.
[108:42.45]No, let's do 4-4.
[108:46.65]Still way too much.
[108:47.33]2.
[108:47.35]84.
[108:48.39]Okay, 2.
[108:51.81]Attack multiplier of 2.
[108:54.31]Alright, now we can actually do it for real this time.
[108:56.39]Ready?
[108:56.61]You guys ready to vote?
[109:09.57]Show stats.
[109:12.93]I think it's pretty evenly matched considering that the bugs do more damage, but the giant enemy spider is way less powerful than Goro.
[109:24.13]Let's see.
[109:26.93]The ants are on the right team.
[109:27.87]Look at the circles.
[109:43.56]Three, two, one, action.
[109:49.34]It is a pull.
[109:51.38]Okay, now I understand what happened.
[109:55.12]All right, looking good.
[109:55.98]Just the little bugs.
[109:57.21]Don't walk off the edge.
[110:00.63]Giant enemy spider is currently attacking two gorillas.
[110:03.73]We still, look, it's still plenty of game left.
[110:06.77]Scimitar is still alive.
[110:09.74]So is Goro the giant?
[110:12.14]I- This is Goro's game to win right here, I think.
[110:15.58]No, they instantly killed him.
[110:16.80]The bugs win.
[110:17.65]Fuck.
[110:19.67]That wasn't even close.
[110:21.95]Oh, he's doing like the Peter Griffin Family Guy thing when a Family Guy character falls down.
[110:31.33]Okay, that was- That was embarrassing how bad that was.
[110:34.39]They lost very, very, very, very badly.
[110:57.10]And you last versus two.
[110:58.20]10-10.
[111:00.22]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[111:09.42]How's that?
[111:13.25]Good luck.
[111:15.19]Two 10-10.
[111:15.79]There were Zinosauras.
[111:27.83]12,000?
[111:28.03]Yeah.
[111:28.69]That says 12,000, doesn't it?
[111:29.57]I don't know if the bird sounds.
[111:37.53]Oh, I just realized what you're talking about.
[111:41.96]Oh, and by the way, did you notice?
[111:45.22]It's really fucking windy out.
[111:58.68]It's rigged.
[111:59.26]Alright, wait, I'll turn- Alright, not for this one.
[112:07.31]For the next one.
[112:07.91]You're right.
[112:08.31]That's just like- You're right, you're right, you're right.
[112:10.95]Okay, here we go.
[112:11.57]One.
[112:11.73]Two.
[112:13.70]Oh, not yet.
[112:17.78]I can't turn the bird sounds off.
[112:28.72]One.
[112:28.88]Two.
[112:30.12]Two and a half.
[112:35.59]Three.
[112:45.09]And you guys were concerned about that.
[112:50.20]One of them's already dead.
[113:04.20]Okay.
[113:05.44]Bugs win.
[113:10.55]I would be shocked if they won again.
[113:12.56]I'm just going to be very clear.
[113:59.59]And 250 Angry Joes.
[114:02.17]Which, by the way, by the way, one of them, the captain, is covered in fucking armor.
[114:11.51]Surrounded with armor and he's gonna have guns and weapons all over him.
[114:38.22]He's getting into hockey pads.
[114:39.56]He can play with his big brother.
[115:08.64]Okay.
[115:08.74]What do you think?
[115:21.37]A legion of Angry Joes.
[115:24.61]With one Angry Joe dialed up to a thousand.
[115:30.80]Or a couple of bugs.
[115:43.54]Good luck.
[115:45.56]Oh, we are the galleon infantry.
[115:49.02]We're the ones that stomp on those bugs and camaraderie.
[115:57.40]Catherine needs a hat.
[115:58.20]Sure.
[116:23.01]We ready?
[116:25.17]Bet's in.
[116:26.91]Three.
[116:28.51]Two.
[116:29.93]One.
[116:30.07]Go.
[116:32.01]I can't- Oh shit, one of them went flying.
[116:59.80]I don't even know what they're attacking.
[117:10.10]One of them is getting shot with the machine gun multiple fucking times.
[117:14.76]He's lighting up Joseph.
[117:16.22]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[117:18.16]Yeah.
[117:26.62]It's a fucking rave.
[117:47.71]What are they fighting?
[117:48.79]There's nothing even... Are they fighting each other?
[117:55.23]Are they trying to hit the bugs on the ground?
[117:56.95]Oh shit, they're gonna make it.
[118:15.30]Oh fuck, here they come.
[118:20.35]All right, this there's a guy right now going like this like way in the back This guy's just like freaking out over there wait what happened They won

[119:01.72]That person's having a good time.
[119:04.34]A really good time.
[119:10.07]Fire the cameraman.
[119:10.93]Fire the cameraman.
[119:18.74]Alright, here we go.
[119:19.54]Alright, we'll do... You got instantly overcrowded.
[119:27.19]This is too many.
[119:27.87]Alright, let's get rid of the dance guy.
[119:47.28]Angry Joes versus Commandos.
[119:48.48]All right.
[119:49.77]Oh, yeah.
[119:50.11]That's a good one.
[119:52.07]Or how about, like, just a... Okay.
[119:58.38]15 Commandos versus 250 Joes.
[120:14.58]Wrong team.
[120:16.40]God damn it.
[120:26.05]Okay.
[120:41.99]And we'll give them a, uh, like a fence or something.
[120:45.79]To hide behind.
[121:00.33]Attic.
[121:07.19]Wait, are these turnstiles?
[121:11.05]Hold on.
[121:13.21]I can make them have to go through turnstiles?
[121:15.09]No.
[121:19.58]Wind Dawn?
[121:20.10]Not for this one.
[121:20.54]Hold on.
[121:46.13]It's fucking good enough, whatever.
[121:47.15]Okay, now we're going to put mines.
[121:50.39]Where are the mines?
[122:00.49]Missile launcher.
[122:01.33]Are there mines?
[122:01.84]Yeah, there are land mines.
[122:02.46]Okay.
[122:14.83]This is quite a bet I would be making.
[122:16.64]I don't know if I would make any of these bets.
[122:22.14]I would... I'm going to tell you right now that I don't... I would not vote for the Angry Joes.
[122:26.12]Okay, I'll make it a little better.
[122:30.59]Okay, there.
[122:38.41]I would not vote for the Angry Joes.
[122:48.98]This is a tough one.
[122:50.04]Let me make it easier for you.
[122:50.98]Let me make it harder, actually.
[122:58.02]Now it's actually a hard decision.
[123:04.66]And we're going to remove this wall here.
[123:09.36]Go easy?
[123:09.98]Alright, let's see.
[123:10.56]Put your money where your mouth is, then.
[123:18.16]Team 2 is Commando.
[123:19.90]Team 1 is Angry Joe.
[123:32.70]There's way too many Joes.
[123:34.06]I don't know, man.
[123:36.84]We've seen... ...countless things so far.
[123:39.84]We've seen things that looked impossible to fight die instantly.
[123:47.97]This is a toss-up for me.
[123:48.77]I don't know.
[123:52.74]On one hand, are they going to get overwhelmed by the Joes?
[123:55.56]Or on the second hand, are all the mines going to blow up and kill everybody?
[123:58.44]And there's going to be one commando left just sniping all the Joes running around.
[124:01.15]I don't know.
[124:09.27]In three, two, one, go.
[124:26.34]No, they're gonna hit the other one.
[124:28.31]The bodies are in the way.
[124:30.47]This is fucking heinous.
[124:32.33]They can't move because there's too many bodies.
[124:35.65]Holy shit.
[124:38.59]Oh my god.
[124:48.78]What's with the gas?
[124:50.62]That was fucking horrible.
[124:57.67]They just started turning into cement.
[125:01.97]Human cement.
[125:05.26]Oh, yeah.
[125:07.70]Okay.
[125:08.88]Well, there were too many Joes.
[125:10.64]If they weren't that many Joes, it probably would have been a little bit closer.
[125:21.27]Wall of flesh.
[125:24.17]All right.
[125:25.35]We're going to get rid of the fucking landmines are not fair.
[125:28.61]Let's just be real.
[125:30.63]We're going to get rid of the landmines.
[125:32.05]We're going to keep one landmine right here.
[125:34.30]We're going to get rid of a bunch of the Joes and we're going to make one big Joe.
[125:42.22]One large Joe.
[125:53.95]Who has a 2 and a 2.
[125:55.05]You ready?
[126:07.65]No, he needs way more health than that.
[126:09.65]Times 20 fucking health multiplier.
[126:13.79]More.
[126:15.03]Times 50 health multiplier.
[126:18.02]Let's put him far away though.
[126:18.90]Alright, he's got 10 fucking thousand health.
[126:23.46]Alright, let's go.
[126:25.97]Team 1 is the Joes.
[126:27.65]Team 2 are the Commandos.
[126:29.05]Good luck.
[126:35.04]This is too easy now?
[126:36.50]Well, we'll find out.
[126:40.43]I have removed a bunch of the Joes.
[126:44.89]Team 1, Joe.
[126:45.67]Team 2, Commandos.
[127:01.44]I believe in Big Joe.
[127:03.46]I believe in Mega Joe.
[127:08.18]Alright, here we go.
[127:11.10]What happens?
[127:11.65]Three, two, one.
[127:14.67]Lock the camera.
[127:15.63]Go.
[127:20.09]Uh, well, he slipped.
[127:22.11]There's an extra mine over there, but it's okay.
[127:24.49]It wasn't that bad.
[127:25.27]Uh-oh, they're reloading.
[127:32.08]What's with the gas?
[127:33.34]What's with the gas?
[127:37.00]What the fuck just happened?
[127:39.91]What?
[127:40.67]Wait, what?
[127:41.95]What happened?
[127:43.15]What?
[127:45.97]What was the gas?
[127:50.75]They can't get through.
[127:51.87]Dude, I'm telling you, if that angry Joe gets over here, it's over.
[127:58.94]Are they even hitting anybody?
[128:03.00]How did they get out?
[128:07.78]Do not spread out.
[128:09.30]Are you stupid?
[128:15.01]Oh, gosh.
[128:18.43]They're all stuck.
[128:19.77]There's too many Joes again.
[128:20.83]There's too many dead bodies.
[128:21.71]He is flopping over here very slowly.
[128:25.59]He gets over here, man.
[128:26.81]It's going to be trouble.
[128:32.25]Well, they're all dead.
[128:33.15]Okay, well, whatever.
[128:50.44]Sorry for all the Joe believers.
[128:52.20]There was an extra landmine.
[128:53.30]I'm going to delete that one.
[128:54.22]I'm going to delete that one, and we're going to get rid of that fence.
[129:06.69]There.
[129:09.15]But to make up for it... I get one of these.
[129:21.96]Uh, that's not gonna work.
[130:06.62]Okay.
[130:16.05]Let's make it fair.
[130:32.86]Wrong team.
[130:35.40]It's been a disaster.
[130:44.29]They're very vulnerable, but they have a ton of firepower.
[130:48.35]And we're also going to, I'm going to remove another like 10 to 20 of them.
[130:57.00]They stopped getting all bunched up.
[130:59.22]All right.
[131:01.12]Begin the vote.
[131:01.62]Team two versus team one.
[131:03.06]You've seen how it plays out.
[131:04.52]I think we're ready to go.
[131:18.03]There's no way that Big Joe is going to be able to move.
[131:22.05]I think he can.
[131:22.59]What's it look like?
[131:33.68]Pretty even, actually.
[131:36.98]If I had a vote right now, I'm putting it on the commandos.
[131:41.60]I'm just going to give you honesty here.
[131:44.03]They have machine guns and they have blisters on their head.
[131:48.52]Three, two, one, go.
[131:59.76]Uh-oh.
[132:02.18]Oh, shit!
[132:05.48]Oh, the gas!
[132:11.81]The flamethrower instantly killed him.
[132:19.49]Damn, I would have lost.
[132:23.58]Fire is OP, yeah.
[133:21.79]I think the commandos just do the gas.
[133:34.40]Okay, I'm fucking done.
[133:39.90]Oh shit, Big Joe!
[133:40.96]Big Joe almost out!
[133:52.50]This is the stupidest shit ever.
[134:04.88]Alright, one- I'll do one more.
[134:06.98]One duck-sized Joe versus one horse-sized- 100 horse-sized ducks.
[134:10.56]Whatever it is.
[134:14.17]One duck-sized tiger versus a hundred horse-sized... I don't know.
[134:22.72]get this turned off.
[134:32.17]Okay.
[134:32.83]One duck-sized, one horse-sized boar versus a hundred duck-sized boars.
[134:53.24]Buffalo.
[134:53.62]Grrrrrr!
[135:36.88]Worst noise, runner up.
[135:41.22]Yeah, that's fine.
[135:41.80]I was trying to do a 56K modem.
[135:46.99]That sounded like that for a couple of seconds.
[135:50.13]And I was like, well, fuck it.
[135:50.83]I'm just going to really commit to this.
[135:52.23]Alright, here we go.
[135:58.43]Can they walk?
[136:04.74]Okay, well that was fun.
[136:34.84]Alright, I'm done.
[136:35.60]I'm done.
[136:36.22]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[136:36.98]We're going to play the pawn shop game tomorrow.
[136:39.84]We're going to play No Umbrellas Allowed.
[136:43.38]It's a game where you have to, like, haggle.
[136:47.99]Sell things.
[136:48.47]Buy things.
[136:49.75]Looks really fun.
[136:54.67]I'll do one more.
[136:55.99]One more climactic one.
[136:57.15]Sure.
[137:14.56]This is going to be the final time for you to bet as well.
[137:39.76]Chopsticks?
[137:40.36]I know.
[137:40.82]I'll get them.
[137:47.51]Wrong fucking team.
[138:00.36]No it's not.
[138:00.94]Right team.
[138:31.56]Okay.
[138:31.74]What do you think, Wentz?
[138:40.92]Increase their health?
[138:41.78]Oh, whatever.
[138:49.57]If I was too OP, I'll change that.
[139:02.29]Here we go!
[139:12.91]Yeah, one more vote.
[139:13.65]I'm sitting there like, alright, let's go!
[139:26.87]This is just a sci-fi channel original.
[139:32.48]But what if?
[139:34.12]What if the polar bear had a missile launcher?
[139:41.42]It's like Pixar movies from like 2001.
[139:49.02]But what if we made the claws of the polar bear three inches longer?
[139:55.72]Then it would kill the hippo.
[139:57.68]Yeah.
[139:58.34]Isn't that weird?
[139:59.96]Not really.
[140:06.18]Three, two, one, go!
[140:07.42]That was not even a contest.
[140:22.97]Oh my god.
[140:27.29]Sci-fi channel original.
[140:41.45]That was my biggest bet of the night.
[140:42.93]Oh, I'm sorry Okay, I'm gonna go okay, that's it I'm done, but what if we do this but what if We give the same exact machine gun that we gave the hippo to the polar bear.
[141:00.78]Oh
[141:03.27]Would the polar bear's aerodynamic way of moving prevent the hippo's slow and coordinated movement from being shot?
[141:13.84]Let's put it inside of our simulator.
[141:20.51]Stay tuned for Kathy Mitchell's Copper Pan infomercial, because this is absolutely airing at 3 a.m.
[141:35.53]Are we betting on this one?
[141:42.59]Keep stalling.
[141:43.29]I got to get more points.
[141:48.64]Don't call Aaron at 3 a.m.
[141:52.68]No, it would be don't call Armin at 3 a.m.
[141:57.96]That's Armin saying Aaron.
[141:59.46]So, like, it would be you call Armin, and Armin thinks it's Aaron calling, and it gets it, like, really concerned?
[142:07.23]You've got that bit wrong.
[142:14.69]All right.
[142:17.80]Three, two, one.
[142:20.42]Nope.
[142:25.57]It's not even fucking close it was close it was actually kind of close All right, I'm out of here.
[142:33.63]Goodbye.
[142:33.97]I'm gonna get chopsticks in a second.
[142:35.99]I mean What the fuck wait?
[142:38.89]Why did he win that one?
[142:40.29]Why did he win that one what?
[142:44.60]Holy shit, he's winning them now.
[142:46.42]I didn't do anything different.
[142:47.44]I just pressed the button I
[142:53.83]No, no, there's no more bedding.
[142:54.93]There's no more.
[142:55.45]What do you mean too late?
[142:56.68]What?
[142:57.26]No, we're not bedding anymore.
[142:59.36]Too late.
[142:59.88]Already did it.
[143:00.78]Already bedded?
[143:01.40]What?
[143:01.62]No.
[143:24.37]I'm fucking, I'm leaving, I'm done.
[143:30.59]Did we, what was, you guys were betting?
[143:31.95]No, no more betting.
[143:34.82]No, refund, refund, refund.
[143:36.68]Refund, I'm not even playing.
[143:37.90]Alright, let me, I'm gonna BR back, I'm gonna go P, I'm gonna get the chopsticks.
[143:45.40]Prove that I can use them.
[143:48.91]Give them times 5,000 HP.
[143:50.75]I can't even do that right now.
[143:52.35]Fine.
[143:54.18]We're going to make this fair.
[143:56.00]We're going to make this absolutely completely fair.
[144:00.68]We are going to do Hippopotamus.
[144:04.14]This is the last bed of the night.
[144:05.34]I make it fucking count.
[144:07.14]We're going to do a 4.0 Hippopotamus.
[144:12.02]At times 100 multiplier health.
[144:17.33]More.
[144:18.59]Times 1000 multiplier health.
[144:22.73]Which would give this 900,000 health.
[144:28.37]And then our polar bear is also going to be the same size.
[144:32.34]Was it 4.0?
[144:35.36]Same distance, exactly.
[144:37.42]Different team.
[144:40.26]Let me redo this because people are going to get confused.
[144:42.08]4.0 polar bear.
[144:50.17]500,000 HP.
[144:50.29]We have to do a little bit more than that.
[144:52.85]2,000.
[144:52.97]Okay.
[144:55.57]So he has a million health.
[144:59.75]And the hippopotamus.
[145:00.73]Team 2.
[145:01.15]4.0.
[145:03.65]Although that's not fair.
[145:05.95]3.5.
[145:10.51]Same distance.
[145:12.29]Separate team.
[145:14.34]You've got 1.8 million health.
[145:15.66]That's not fair.
[145:16.38]We're going to do 11. 100.
[145:21.11]Now they both have just about... There's a small disadvantage.
[145:25.27]They're just about a million health each.
[145:34.10]Plasma.
[145:34.48]We're going to do missile launchers.
[146:00.59]Okay.
[146:31.98]You like that strategy?
[146:32.82]Okay.
[146:35.72]So that's, that's mega mega mega.
[146:39.94]That's a mega mega.
[146:41.58]What?
[146:41.74]I don't think that's just so powerful just yet.
[147:09.71]Fence him in.
[147:15.02]He's a good boy.
[147:32.85]Ugh!
[147:33.29]Ugh!
[147:39.72]barnacles.
[147:50.33]Okay.
[147:50.69]Team fucking won for the love of God.
[148:16.02]And then... Rockets.
[148:22.05]A ton of them.
[148:51.84]I gotta redo it.
[149:26.91]The hippo looks actually stronger.
[149:36.67]Okay.
[149:37.67]I need fences.
[149:39.47]So our mechanical gigantic monster fight.
[149:48.86]Let's deal with the fence.
[149:49.94]Okay.
[149:50.40]Fence.
[149:50.82]Static.
[149:52.36]Can't be moved.
[149:53.74]It has to be fucking huge.
[150:29.75]Okay.
[150:31.83]Team 1.
[150:33.39]You know who it is.
[150:34.05]Polar Bear.
[150:36.21]More missile and plasma oriented.
[150:39.21]Team 2 is the Hippo.
[150:41.63]Heavy machine gun fire and light cruise missiles.
[150:55.78]Get a good view.
[150:56.82]I think right here looks about good.
[151:02.81]Right about there looks good to me.
[151:03.97]So this is it.
[151:10.07]Hippo is two.
[151:10.93]Right.
[151:13.03]Hippo is two.
[151:13.61]Polar bear is one.
[151:28.66]And three, two, one.
[151:56.45]He didn't fall out he's still in My god, he's done.
[152:02.80]It's over.
[152:03.88]He's done.
[152:04.56]He's not getting out of that.
[152:05.34]Oh
[152:19.66]They didn't even scratch each other.
[152:21.06]Oh my god.
[152:25.68]Well, that was insane.
[152:27.16]That was crazy.
[152:30.32]I'm going to go get chopsticks.
[152:33.67]That's the end of the stream, pretty much.
[152:36.63]I will close the stream out.
[152:37.61]We'll see you tomorrow for the pawn shop game.
[152:40.15]Seems like a chill, fun game to experience.
[152:42.69]So see you tomorrow, same time, 2pm Pacific.
[152:44.77]I'll be right back.
[154:46.16]Okay.
[154:47.84]Got my bowl.
[154:49.50]By the way, this is going to be difficult because I got little carrots that are wet and slippery.
[154:56.94]So if I can pick these up, then you know I know what I'm doing.
[155:02.42]Let me just exit the game.
[155:09.46]Quit the game.
[155:12.12]They're little baby carrots and they're wet and they're very slippery.
[155:17.52]So, let me come back.
[155:20.14]I'm going to turn the exposure up.
[155:35.69]Okay, there we go.
[155:36.81]Okay, hi.
[155:37.23]Let's move you over here.
[155:39.56]So...
[155:43.24]just wanted to show everybody I've got a bowl with carrots in it and I've got chopsticks so as you can see let's just go ahead and get one of these carrots it's very simple it's very easy as you see I'm and these are slip oh there's probably hair on it there's probably hair on it they're slippery there's probably hair on that
[156:13.82]Because, like, I have, like, Otto has hair.
[156:23.51]They're really slippery, but you get the idea.
[156:25.57]If this was a piece of sushi, I'd be fine.
[156:26.81]I win!
[156:32.23]What do you mean fraud?
[156:41.86]What are you talking about?
[156:46.81]See you tomorrow.
[156:55.59]Off-camera chopstick devil.
[156:57.53]I told you I could use them.
[156:58.43]What do you think I am?
[157:00.99]These are good.
[157:04.21]There were a shitload of subs today and I missed a bunch of them.
[157:07.21]I missed almost all of them.
[157:14.64]Carrots are really hard to eat.
[157:18.27]They take forever.
[157:21.47]But pawn shop game tomorrow.
[157:23.12]See you tomorrow.
[157:24.86]Next week we're going to do Sims 3 Mod Hell and Deltarune.
[157:28.72]I'm not going to play it tomorrow.
[157:29.52]I'm going to play Chapter 1 on my own time to refresh my brain.
[157:33.16]But we'll see you tomorrow maybe.
[157:42.23]Carrots take so fucking long to eat.
[157:51.36]There we go.
[157:52.10]I got through them.
[157:58.02]Yeah, I want to... How long... Okay, so now that it's out, I have a question.
[158:03.28]So now that Deltarune is out, it came out like three or four hours ago, has anybody beaten it?
[158:09.37]How long is it?
[158:09.97]Do we know?
[158:11.05]Like, have people completed it?
[158:14.09]I know it just came out like three or four hours ago, but I'm just trying to figure out how long the chapter is.
[158:26.20]Is it less than six hours?
[158:30.42]I have not yet.
[158:30.98]I'm not sure.
[158:31.46]Probably like four hours based off the last one.
[158:44.50]Okay.
[158:55.37]Four to five hours?
