[00:11.85]I'm not ready for this.
[00:14.07]It's been a while since I've done a Scare Saturday.
[00:16.59]But hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:18.41]Jerma here with SCP-432.
[00:24.11]I've been sitting here.
[00:24.87]Can I just tell you before we get going?
[00:26.56]I've been sitting here for like 15 minutes.
[00:30.88]Just sitting here going...
[00:33.72]Do I want to do this?
[00:35.07]And the answer is yes.
[00:37.11]Let's go.
[00:40.45]So this is kind of like the other SCP games.
[00:42.29]It is very, very dark.
[00:45.77]Kind of like the other SCP games where you go investigate things and stuff.
[00:55.37]That's a light.
[00:55.99]Okay.
[00:57.92]Apparently I gotta pick up artifacts or something.
[01:03.26]The worst part is just the fact that it's just the same texture over and over again in this maze of a building.
[01:15.94]And there's a monster in here.
[01:19.58]Somewhere.
[01:20.21]There's a valve.
[01:22.37]Don't think I need to do anything with that.
[01:24.33]Okay.
[01:24.87]What's this?
[01:26.89]You found an artifact.
[01:28.41]The artifact.
[01:29.09]Okay.
[01:31.09]So what do I do with it?
[01:33.02]I think I just have to pick them up and then escape.
[01:40.50]Just gotta escape.
[01:42.98]Just gotta pick up the artifacts and just get the hell out of here.
[01:47.43]Crying out loud.
[01:48.95]It's a goddamn maze.
[01:52.03]These pipes keep scaring the shit out of me.
[01:57.21]What was that?
[02:01.13]I kind of don't want to go over to this light, but I kind of feel like I have to.
[02:04.25]Alright, F is flashlight.
[02:08.39]Alright, that's just the light bulb.
[02:11.50]Okay.
[02:14.20]Why am I shaking?
[02:15.58]Why is... Why is the world shaking?
[02:18.68]I can hear noises that I don't like to hear.
[02:30.96]What's that?
[02:32.56]What's this, like, fairy dust on the ground?
[02:34.24]Oh, is this roller skates?
[02:42.11]Sick, I got, like, the roller skates.
[02:44.45]I can compete in, like, the roller derby.
[02:49.27]I got two.
[02:51.59]Not exactly sure what that means, but there's nothing over here.
[03:01.80]I wish there was like a map.
[03:06.96]Turn the flashlight off.
[03:07.62]Turn the flashlight off.
[03:16.97]Hold.
[03:19.37]What was that?
[03:21.85]What is that on the wall?
[03:27.32]It's gone.
[03:27.80]What is that?
[03:31.67]It's not there anymore.
[03:37.00]My whole body just tensed up.
[03:40.00]I feel like I just lifted 200 pounds of weight.
[03:46.32]I just did all my reps for, like, the week.
[03:50.38]Because, like, the thing with, like, the flaming Doctor Doom skull was looking at me.
[04:01.85]There's just no... I just don't know where I'm going.
[04:07.07]There's just no indication of where you're ever supposed to go in these games.
[04:17.14]Good evening.
[04:19.04]My name is Jerma.
[04:21.78]I would like to sell you... some land.
[04:29.23]What is... AH!
[04:30.65]HOO!
[04:40.16]Did you see that fucking thing?
[05:03.73]How long has it been?
[05:05.31]I've only been recording for five minutes!
[05:10.31]Well... The tight corridors make it so much worse.
[05:17.21]But, uh, quick little scare Saturdays, guys.
[05:20.97]I'm a baby, I know, but that thing was too scary, and I almost died playing it.
[05:27.86]So, thank you all so much for watching, really do appreciate it.
[05:30.82]I got a pretty good suntan today.
[05:32.40]I'm not red because I'm, like, scared, I'm red because I had a suntan.
[05:36.33]But a SCP-432, link will be in the description, go play it and have your pants changed within, like, ten minutes.
[05:44.67]Because, fuck this game.
[05:46.90]I ain't doing it anymore.
[05:59.99]Thank you.
