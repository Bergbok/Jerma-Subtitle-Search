[00:02.83]Oh, I thought I was ready to talk.
[00:04.02]Wasn't, apparently.
[00:05.42]Apparently wasn't ready to talk.
[00:06.56]I guess not.
[00:14.38]And I have to say... Let me resituate myself here.
[00:18.35]Let me put my seat down.
[00:20.63]Let me put my seat up, actually.
[00:21.87]I don't like that.
[00:22.53]Let me move this.
[00:24.33]My seat here.
[00:24.89]There we go.
[00:25.25]That's better.
[00:26.95]So I have to say, this is the first time for everything, and for the first time ever, ever, since I started streaming regularly.
[00:37.86]That's the hardest word to say in the English language, by the way.
[00:40.82]Regularly.
[00:43.18]Since I started streaming regularly, this is the first time I've ever streamed on the first of multiple days that I tell you a stream could happen.
[00:57.45]Think about that.
[00:57.99]That's a huge milestone for us.
[01:01.82]Let's say I stream on Sunday, and I go, Oh, hey guys, you know what?
[01:05.52]The next stream, maybe Tuesday or Wednesday.
[01:09.50]It's probably Tuesday, but maybe Wednesday.
[01:11.58]Tuesday or Wednesday.
[01:13.16]It's never happened on the Tuesday.
[01:15.81]It's always the last day of the range that I give you.
[01:19.45]And now, for the first time ever, it's the first one.
[01:22.37]It's the first one.
[01:25.51]And I'm early.
[01:28.97]no I'm actually like 40 minutes over what I told you I was thinking about but look you all know that what you do you thought the stream was gonna happen tomorrow so like holy he's streaming today oh nice first time ever oh he's an hour late but he does that every day anyways right that's you already know that hold on give me one second I want to rearrange my desk and I don't want it to be loud
[02:15.41]Show us the boy.
[02:16.15]Show us the boy.
[02:16.69]I will... I promise there will be at least one auto-appearance before the stream ends.
[02:23.54]Not right now, though.
[02:25.96]He's sleeping over here.
[02:26.90]He just came in and he's resting.
[02:30.24]He's buried his head... Whoa!
[02:32.27]That was going to be a huge burp if I didn't have extreme skill to suppress that.
[02:39.29]He buried his head under the covers and he's sleeping.
[02:41.59]I'm not going to wake him up for content.
[02:43.13]He can stay asleep.
[02:44.04]When he's ready...
[02:46.32]And he's ready to view.
[02:50.66]We'll see him.
[02:54.30]Stop burping and talk.
[02:55.44]Look, you know how many times you burp a day?
[03:00.90]You burp probably like 600 or 700 times a day.
[03:06.96]I think it's a little less than that, but still, it's a lot.
[03:16.04]It's like probably like at least 50 or like 30.
[03:18.22]Are you okay?
[03:23.69]You never burp.
[03:24.51]Yeah, right.
[03:26.59]You're the same person that says, I mean, I fart sometimes, but like not really.
[03:32.67]Like sometimes if I have like a big meal.
[03:35.23]No, you're the guy that like goes and hides downstairs, turns the bathroom fan on, turns the sink on and farts.
[03:47.15]So, I got you.
[03:48.59]I know who you are.
[03:56.20]You're a hider.
[03:59.18]Or you're like, you're the kind of person, correct me if I'm wrong here, where you will go pretend to have a cigarette to make sure that you don't have to fart around people.
[04:10.97]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[04:11.55]I'm just gonna go have a smoke real quick.
[04:13.49]I didn't know you were a smoker.
[04:14.60]Yeah, I have a shitty fucking habit, whatever.
[04:17.30]And you go out there and just rip ass outside.
[04:21.82]And then you come back and you don't want people to know that you're doing that.
[04:25.18]You'd rather have people think you were smoking cigarettes.
[04:28.00]And like fart in their presence.
[04:32.49]Because that's me.
[04:33.91]I'm describing me.
[04:36.95]If we were in a big area, a big crowded place, and I had nowhere to go,
[04:42.12]And I had to, like, I had to rip ass really, really badly.
[04:45.68]I would rather pretend that the group of people know I smoked cigarettes than, like, fart in their presence.
[04:52.70]And I know there's a lot of you like me.
[04:59.78]Or go take, like, a phone call.
[05:04.75]I lean my head over and go...
[05:11.48]I got a call.
[05:11.92]I think it's my mother.
[05:12.58]I'll walk outside.
[05:17.15]Alright, enough stalling.
[05:24.27]Let's go.
[05:25.37]We're going to continue Mr. Satan's Wrestling Empire.
[05:27.85]If you didn't catch the stream yesterday.
[05:37.35]Off to a great start, Jerma.
[05:38.81]Nice.
[05:39.63]I like to hear that.
[05:43.32]If you didn't catch the stream yesterday of Wrestling Empire, it's fucking one of the best games I've played in the last couple of years.
[05:47.32]Guaranteed, that's not a joke.
[05:50.26]I do want to make something really clear.
[05:51.34]You know what time it is?
[05:57.58]You have any idea what time it is?
[06:08.94]It's this time.
[06:10.58]Because here's the game.
[06:17.30]Mr. Satan continues.
[06:18.59]How much money do I make?
[06:20.27]$300 a week?
[06:29.39]That's when I wanted it to start, and I fucked it all up.
[06:33.10]I thought that was the beginning of the song, but it was the end of the song.
[06:37.90]Whatever.
[06:40.16]You get the idea.
[06:43.43]You know, the more that I listen to this song, I've heard it like 60 or 70 times in the last 24 hours.
[06:49.63]I like this song.
[06:52.05]This is a good song.
[06:54.63]I want to put this on a playlist now.
[06:55.96]This song is fucking pretty.
[06:57.02]This is an awesome song.
[07:02.94]Alright, let's go.
[07:04.70]I had nothing scheduled today.
[07:06.24]So we can... What do I need to do?
[07:08.72]Am I under any contractual obligations to do anything?
[07:21.40]No, right?
[07:22.90]No contract bullshit that I have to do by a certain date.
[07:29.18]My agility sucks.
[07:30.14]Should I do agility?
[07:35.91]Look in the top right.
[07:37.67]Oh, no.
[07:38.05]Okay, good, good, good.
[07:38.85]That's good to know.
[07:41.91]I'm gonna do agility because I feel like it's gonna be like, get your agility to 80.
[07:45.27]More strength?
[07:46.61]Um, alright, yeah.
[07:50.73]I lost skill.
[07:51.71]I lost skill.
[07:52.19]That's bad.
[07:53.73]I get a day off.
[07:54.19]It's fine.
[07:56.85]Alright.
[07:57.65]Today's a day of rest.
[08:04.65]No creative control is bad.
[08:06.13]I know I completely fucked over everything, but whatever.
[08:08.73]Look, I can just beat the boss up until I get to leave.
[08:13.82]You don't keep Mr. Satan under a contract if he doesn't want to be on it, alright?
[08:16.78]I thought that was the Joker.
[08:21.49]I think that's supposed to be Doink the Clown.
[08:22.89]Okay.
[08:31.08]In nine weeks, you might be able to renegotiate.
[08:32.86]Alright, we'll do that then.
[08:37.44]Also, by the way, if you didn't see yesterday's stream, you're in for a real fucking treat because this is seriously... I'm almost swearing for no reason, right?
[08:45.98]There was no reason for me to say the F word there.
[08:48.74]Like, I just deliberately put the F word in there, but I don't know why.
[08:52.22]Like, I was like, oh, that's gonna sound cool.
[08:53.76]No, I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[08:58.68]Okay, I think this is the charity event, right?
[09:03.86]This is for charity for something.
[09:08.09]What was that?
[09:10.75]Did he just, like, hit his head on the sign?
[09:16.99]What was that sound?
[09:20.17]Vulture with Thomas Sun.
[09:26.28]And Mr. Satan with Motorola Chan.
[09:32.22]I can't walk.
[09:33.09]There we go.
[09:46.77]Is this for?
[09:47.41]What's this for?
[09:47.87]And this is my... Did he come up with a weight?
[09:55.18]This is a special charity event that would raise money for good causes around the world.
[10:07.69]Were they mad that I was turned around?
[10:10.07]Those in attendance have already donated bit by bit showing up, so give yourselves a big round of applause.
[10:14.53]Get away from me.
[10:16.39]Put that down.
[10:18.49]And we hope you'll be joined by many more watching at home who can also pledge their donation.
[10:22.58]Is this a hardcore match?
[10:25.36]Enough talking, Vulture.
[10:26.54]Let's give the world what they want.
[10:27.78]Let me guess, a big match for a big donation.
[10:35.85]Wait, why does the ref have a bomb?
[10:53.09]Alright, let's go!
[10:57.89]Why is it on fire?
[11:01.73]Holy shit.
[11:02.51]Oh, I got him with it.
[11:03.29]I got him.
[11:03.59]I got him.
[11:07.28]So this is just a singles match for charity.
[11:09.06]Alright, well that was... I'm fine.
[11:12.34]Alright, how much health do I have?
[11:14.02]Alright, let's kick this guy's ass.
[11:18.47]It's funny every time.
[11:20.11]I'm sorry.
[11:20.55]It's one of those games where it's funny every fucking time.
[11:23.23]Should I just count them out?
[11:29.76]Alright, let's do some wrestling.
[11:42.87]Why did the ref have a bomb?
[11:44.33]I don't, I don't, that's the part I don't understand.
[11:51.07]The audience?
[11:54.17]I love how unhinged the referees are as well as the players, right?
[11:57.97]Typically, you want your referee to be somebody that's collected, calm, tries to get order, holds the court, whatever.
[12:04.62]This guy is just as fucked up as everybody else.
[12:24.02]Where's he going?
[12:24.76]He's not paying attention.
[12:32.54]I got him.
[12:36.51]Oh, it's... That's another thing these guys do.
[12:42.49]They just get on the top rope.
[12:44.05]The people that aren't even supposed to be in here.
[12:46.45]Like... Get the fuck out of here!
[12:50.39]You fucking little worm!
[13:02.33]Alright, I'm gonna drop this guy on his head.
[13:07.42]Big DDT.
[13:11.40]Grab him by his jowls and shake him.
[13:15.66]Alright, it's time.
[13:19.69]Let's go.
[13:20.07]This is it.
[13:20.85]That's a special move.
[13:25.07]It's over.
[13:26.69]Hear those crunches?
[13:33.11]Got out?
[13:37.25]The match is not over yet.
[13:38.33]Get out.
[13:38.93]Get out of here.
[13:39.39]I didn't win yet.
[13:40.48]I know we both thought it was a guarantee, but it didn't happen.
[13:47.24]That's it.
[13:49.18]Something broke over on stage left.
[13:51.16]I don't know what it was.
[13:57.98]What broke?
[13:58.82]Did you hear that?
[14:03.87]Who's this?
[14:06.87]Wait, who's that lady?
[14:12.22]You see this person out here?
[14:13.02]Who's this person?
[14:18.76]I'm so confused.
[14:20.91]Yeah, what?
[14:22.17]Ellie Knots?
[14:25.89]What are you doing?
[14:26.41]Who is this?
[14:30.21]He couldn't even get out of the ring.
[14:32.53]He's a commentator?
[14:35.48]I thought this was a fan.
[14:43.88]Oh my god, I'm gonna get counted out.
[14:49.83]It is a fan!
[14:52.41]Oh no, it's not.
[15:02.50]Oops.
[15:03.94]Alright, big move to end it.
[15:04.78]Here we go.
[15:07.45]That's not what I wanted, but it's okay.
[15:13.93]That's a pin.
[15:14.65]Got it.
[15:15.81]One.
[15:16.77]Two.
[15:22.00]This guy is... Stop booing!
[15:33.80]God damn it.
[15:36.89]is this budget sting I think there's a lot of licensed kind of characters that are in the game in quotes all right I didn't want to where's my manager and how come he's not helping me they've renamed and sort of changed slightly a lot of people that look like characters so if you just don't the clown I'm that's supposed to be doing the clown
[16:10.54]All right, get out.
[16:18.79]Jesus, this guy's resilient.
[16:21.87]Get out.
[16:27.39]Three.
[16:30.56]There it is.
[16:30.96]All right.
[16:33.02]This guy refuses to die.
[16:34.28]Yeah.
[16:35.02]Here comes Ellie Knotts.
[16:38.54]What do you want?
[16:39.00]What do you want?
[16:39.38]Why are you looking at me?
[16:40.04]Get away from me.
[16:42.51]That was weird.
[16:43.15]Somebody said, are you gonna kill any more friends today?
[16:54.84]I did not kill Shmoe, okay?
[17:00.32]The last match that me and Schmo had, I did beat him over and over again in the head with a bat.
[17:06.44]In like a garbage can lid.
[17:10.22]And he died two days later.
[17:12.21]But it said he died of natural causes.
[17:15.69]It didn't say he suffered any injuries.
[17:17.79]I didn't do that.
[17:26.21]It said natural causes.
[17:30.65]A natural bat to the head.
[17:32.97]The bat was made out of wood.
[17:40.60]Okay, here we go.
[17:41.16]Hold on.
[17:42.40]So you had fun out there, Mr. Satan.
[17:44.12]Well, you made quite a mess of the arena.
[17:48.27]Oh.
[17:49.89]If we ever want to book this venue again, you better pay $200 towards the damages.
[17:53.03]What damages?
[17:59.78]Oh, because I threw the bomb, but the ref had it in his hand.
[18:03.73]I just took it from him.
[18:08.39]And look, here's the thing.
[18:10.29]Listen, this is where you get weird, legally speaking, right?
[18:14.87]So whose fault was it?
[18:17.88]Referee brings bomb into the ring.
[18:20.06]I grab bomb, throw bomb.
[18:22.46]Guy picks bomb up on ground.
[18:25.20]Bomb blows up in his hand.
[18:26.60]So what happened?
[18:29.52]Like, the referee didn't detonate it.
[18:31.44]I didn't detonate it.
[18:32.12]He picked it up and blew up in his hand.
[18:34.56]That's not my fault.
[18:36.78]That's like collectively, we should all have to split the bill, in my opinion.
[18:40.00]At least me and the ref.
[18:44.25]The ref brought it in the ring.
[18:45.21]I'm just trying to fucking get rid of the damn thing.
[18:51.11]Referee brought it into the ring, and he's just holding it.
[18:53.53]I took it out of his hand, and I fucking whipped it.
[18:55.37]I was like, get this out of here.
[18:57.64]And then he picked it up because he wanted to use it.
[18:59.62]And it blew up.
[19:04.64]I accept 45% of the bill there.
[19:06.33]Not all of it.
[19:09.43]I think the referee made out really, really well.
[19:11.47]And who brought it, by the way?
[19:17.35]Anyone that can beat Vulture deserves to be at Hollywood as well.
[19:22.54]Wait, what?
[19:25.00]We feel you'd be a valuable addition to the cast and we'd like to make you a star with this deal.
[19:34.44]Oh, shit.
[19:34.86]This is way better than my contract.
[19:36.60]Now, this is the guy next to me?
[19:38.75]That's the owner?
[19:39.33]Okay, when I sign the contract, throw him out the window.
[19:43.01]You know what I mean?
[19:46.51]Like, let's go.
[19:47.05]I'll sign this right now.
[19:52.27]Only paid for winning matches.
[19:53.35]That's fine.
[19:53.73]I win every match.
[19:59.26]This is a good contract.
[20:04.52]I want longer.
[20:08.48]I want at least 12 weeks.
[20:11.69]But that's $3,400 a week.
[20:12.95]This guy's paying me $300 a week.
[20:16.29]And I have no control over anything that I ever do.
[20:21.29]Do you think right now he's side-eyeing me?
[20:23.91]It's like almost like I'm kind of... I want to give him like a telepathic text with my eyes.
[20:29.51]Saying like, motherfucker, I want five grand a week when we go in the car.
[20:34.84]And I decide if I'm going to do this or not.
[20:39.60]I'll do 12 weeks.
[20:40.28]Let's go.
[20:40.70]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[20:44.48]Movie shoots don't tend to last that long.
[20:46.92]We prefer to keep this short.
[20:48.04]Oh, fuck.
[20:53.56]Damn it.
[20:57.03]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[20:58.17]I'll do six weeks.
[21:05.53]Okay, alright, alright.
[21:10.79]We'll book you against Vulture straight away to reignite you a few ways.
[21:13.62]Is this supposed to be scripted?
[21:19.26]Listen, Mr. Satan, a lot has changed since we first signed you to $3,400 a week.
[21:23.20]30 seconds ago.
[21:25.28]A lot has changed.
[21:27.11]We all have to make sacrifices to stay afloat.
[21:29.05]So how would you feel about taking a pay cut?
[21:31.79]Excuse me?
[21:32.63]I just... We haven't even left the office yet.
[21:39.51]We have not... I haven't even gone to the bathroom since I signed that contract.
[21:44.12]No, you... No, excuse me.
[21:45.52]Pay me what we agreed.
[21:47.06]Fuck that.
[21:50.80]WHAT?
[21:53.10]If you insist on being a financial drain, I'm gonna have to cut you off?
[22:00.24]Did I get fired?
[22:02.14]What am I in?
[22:03.85]I'm in wrestling school.
[22:10.63]What just happened?
[22:11.49]I got- I- What happened?
[22:17.79]What?
[22:29.20]Now I'm back in wrestling school.
[22:39.16]Um... Okay, now I know who my biggest enemies in the world are.
[22:47.25]I was part of that, um... What was... I don't know what the name of my card was before.
[22:51.95]They treated me like shit.
[22:54.03]They paid me nothing.
[22:54.79]But that guy at least fought for me.
[22:58.21]No, don't touch the bomb.
[23:01.05]That's bait.
[23:02.25]Because they know that I'm going to pay for everything.
[23:04.53]After I was just talking shit about it.
[23:07.91]Mr. Satan, shouldn't you be shooting a movie instead of doing something as lowly as wrestling?
[23:11.81]Yeah, I would if I didn't get the rug pulled underneath me.
[23:15.32]After I signed a contract.
[23:17.38]Stick to that nonsense because you don't belong in the ring with me.
[23:22.66]You know, that stings.
[23:24.48]Evidently, I'm a little out of touch.
[23:25.76]You're so far under my radar, I don't even know who the hell you are.
[23:29.32]I'm like so sad I can't even do the Mr. Satan voice.
[23:32.40]I'll make you famous tonight and you'll realize there is such a thing as bad publicity.
[23:45.88]Is he counting himself out?
[23:52.98]I can't fucking believe that just happened.
[23:54.68]Did I even get any incentive payment for joining?
[23:57.64]No.
[23:58.84]It was I left my organization, joined a new one, and they fired me within the first 10 seconds of signing the contract.
[24:06.82]That's so sad.
[24:07.60]What's up?
[24:11.65]Because you didn't ask for an advance.
[24:15.71]Well, I didn't think I was going to have to ask for an advance.
[24:23.05]Your contract died of natural causes.
[24:25.81]That's a good one.
[24:27.09]That's actually good.
[24:28.28]That was a really good joke.
[24:29.62]I'm serious.
[24:30.26]That's perfect.
[24:30.90]I wish I said that.
[24:37.86]Okay.
[24:43.64]Good.
[24:45.14]I keep hurting myself when I do these moves.
[24:52.86]Ayyyy yip!
[25:00.19]Should we go off our injury to this guy?
[25:07.19]Take the green contract, not the red one.
[25:14.19]Alright, let's put this guy out. Goodnight.
[25:26.19]See you later.
[25:28.89]How come there's no music?
[25:31.43]You know, I was thinking about this last night.
[25:34.19]And it sort of almost adds to how funny the game is in a way.
[25:39.95]And it's also because I've been in wrestling school as a contract.
[25:43.19]So there's no audience members.
[25:45.63]Every time I get signed within like a week, something horrible happens and I lose my contract.
[25:49.96]So there's no crowd noise.
[25:52.08]That's what you're missing right now.
[25:55.56]You're missing the, like, woo!
[25:57.08]Yahoo!
[25:57.90]Watch that!
[26:00.90]But it actually kind of adds to, like, how awkward this is.
[26:13.87]Remember, you're killing people.
[26:15.23]I have not killed anybody.
[26:22.41]Name me one person I've killed that I killed, like, in the ring.
[26:25.75]You know what I mean?
[26:26.61]It's nobody.
[26:27.05]Okay, that sounded bad, but I assure you he's fine.
[26:39.92]All right, give me a new contract.
[26:54.76]Mr. Satan has reached the limit of wrestling school's popularity.
[26:59.08]Yeah, I... What the... I can't... What am I supposed to do about this?
[27:02.56]Can I get a contract that's not a piece of shit?
[27:15.47]Smoke was a lawyer.
[27:16.51]He could have helped you.
[27:18.91]Schmo- Okay, those of you guys saying, oh no, what did I do to Schmoke?
[27:22.89]Do you remember the absolute double cross that Schmoke did to me?
[27:28.14]Where he threw the match and like hugged the opposition after I lost?
[27:37.04]Ronald Weiner feels great today and is in perfect health.
[27:41.88]Mr. Satan won 82% of his 17 matches.
[27:47.52]Hardcore tag team versus blonde blunders team.
[27:56.59]I... I need to get... Alright, let's go.
[28:02.13]Hardcore match.
[28:03.79]You know what that means.
[28:04.51]Let's do it.
[28:08.09]Oh, it's this guy.
[28:08.85]Remember this guy from the first career?
[28:10.48]I am... Let's say this is a hardcore match.
[28:15.14]Alright, I'm going for this guy.
[28:22.11]He's my partner.
[28:22.69]Mr. Satan and Vendetta.
[28:25.43]Alright, Vendetta.
[28:33.82]Walk intimidatingly to the ring.
[28:35.34]Oh, we're already going.
[28:54.70]Vegeta.
[28:55.34]Yeah, it is Vegeta.
[29:02.99]Vegeta.
[29:03.63]Mr. Satan and Vegeta.
[29:04.97]Oh my god.
[29:23.23]You don't challenge me to a hardcore match and- Okay.
[29:31.40]I want the- I wanna- Where's- Where's Vegeta?
[29:37.36]What?
[29:38.54]Where's Vegeta?
[29:40.21]Where's Vegeta?
[29:41.69]Get out here, Vegeta!
[29:42.67]I need help!
[29:47.29]No, I don't wanna take the desk!
[29:54.02]Can I borrow this?
[29:54.70]It's a legal murder.
[30:08.54]What?
[30:22.38]Let's get him.
[30:24.16]Let's get him, Vegeta.
[30:27.85]Hold on, Vegeta, I got an idea.
[30:57.25]Can we pin him?
[30:57.99]I can't pin him out here?
[31:03.24]Why can't I pin him?
[31:05.30]This guy's not supposed to be in the ring.
[31:06.66]I think this guy's... I just had to go to Super Saiyan for a minute there, Machina.
[31:20.60]No, no, that's like part of the, uh, right?
[31:23.62]Like, Vegeta upstages me.
[31:26.12]And we have a rivalry.
[31:28.68]And, right?
[31:29.70]It's like we're both strong.
[31:31.06]And there has to be a big rivalry between us.
[31:33.94]And then we fight a few times.
[31:39.72]Okay, um.
[31:40.98]Alright, Vegeta, come in here.
[31:42.18]Pass that to me.
[31:45.25]Pass me that.
[31:48.12]Let me see that thing.
[31:49.04]I'm gonna use it on him.
[31:50.42]What did that guy do that for?
[31:52.87]Why did he do that?
[31:53.69]That guy was just showing off at like a trampoline park.
[31:56.45]That wasn't even him trying to fight anybody.
[32:23.22]It's like this is murder.
[32:24.96]This is actual murder, but like What happened?
[32:27.73]What happened to him?
[32:28.47]He like hurt his back.
[32:29.49]What happened?
[32:38.27]Okay, all right, okay, so we won we did it that's the win Did we win?
[32:57.21]What happened?
[33:01.39]What's wrong?
[33:02.17]Okay, into the ring.
[33:13.32]I'm fine.
[33:19.42]Why?
[33:19.70]Get up.
[33:20.12]What's wrong with me?
[33:20.98]Why can't I get up?
[33:23.54]He's not coming back in the ring and I can't pin him out there.
[33:26.49]What am I supposed to do about this, Coach?
[33:32.22]I don't know what to do.
[33:38.44]Oh my god, this is horrible.
[33:42.98]How do I get him back in the ring?
[33:56.93]All right, come here.
[33:59.57]Get in the ring.
[34:01.43]Get in the ring.
[34:02.03]How do I throw him in the ring?
[34:05.24]There we go.
[34:06.10]All right.
[34:07.50]Okay, just... By the way, this is revenge from my career.
[34:13.48]Okay, dude, you all saw that.
[34:16.78]He could have just easily had taken that fall right there and been fine.
[34:19.47]Just stay down.
[34:22.88]Are you kidding me?
[34:24.62]Really?
[34:24.88]Do you see what shape your friend is in right now?
[34:27.46]I almost want to let this guy pin me.
[34:30.04]Because this is awful.
[34:44.63]Pick him up and just end it.
[34:45.69]Alright, Vegeta.
[34:50.41]Go for it.
[34:52.71]That's it.
[34:53.93]Yeah.
[34:54.25]All right.
[34:55.47]Let's go.
[35:05.56]Vegeta is upset that he was barely involved in that match.
[35:12.36]Mr. Satan has reached the limit of wrestling school's popularity.
[35:15.58]Yeah, I know.
[35:17.32]Blonde Blunder severely injured his leg in that match and will be unable to wrestle for the next four weeks.
[35:23.20]Even then, he may be a shadow of his former self.
[35:28.12]Oh boy.
[35:34.14]All order is upset that he was barely involved.
[35:51.62]Vegeta has turned face and will now be portrayed in a positive light.
[35:58.18]The year is now 2022 and Mr. Satan has turned 26 years old.
[36:04.20]I have an 83% win rate.
[36:10.57]Alright, give me some new shit.
[36:15.05]I have to get out of the wrestling school.
[36:18.94]How many times do I have to embarrass this guy in a singles match before somebody signs me and I can go fight somebody?
[36:27.27]Oh my god, that was funny.
[36:34.85]This guy's bringing a camera.
[36:43.12]Is this guy bringing the camera to... I think you can use the roster to approach a company boss for a contract.
[36:48.51]I might have to try that.
[36:54.89]Wait, Benz is back with a... He's got a little... He's got... Alright, okay.
[36:59.65]You want to play?
[37:00.57]He's got a pep in his step now.
[37:02.54]He's been training.
[37:03.16]Alright, fine.
[37:21.07]Okay, the way I was just running around right there.
[37:22.77]I had so much intent there.
[37:25.57]That was like a Resident Evil 2 speedrun.
[37:30.48]Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[37:40.04]I wasn't stopping for items.
[37:41.32]I just had one goal in mind.
[37:43.08]Alright, come on in.
[37:45.62]Let's go.
[37:46.24]Let's wrestle.
[37:46.76]I promise I won't hit you with a chair again.
[38:05.54]Duplex!
[38:07.64]Benz is coming to avenge Blonde Blunder.
[38:09.62]Watch me break his leg, too.
[38:12.98]Holy shit, that was awesome.
[38:21.35]Do it again.
[38:34.62]Miscalculated by just a small amount, I think.
[38:45.13]Big roll up.
[38:50.72]Plus, L and R at the singles menu.
[38:53.04]It'll change what you do.
[38:56.50]Yeah, I can simulate events, right?
[38:58.14]I can skip events.
[38:59.76]I like playing, though.
[39:00.46]This game's really fun.
[39:06.53]Like, alright, so M. Dickie made this game, right?
[39:11.89]Like, can we... I say this frequently.
[39:15.54]Maybe not that frequently, but still.
[39:18.22]Can, like, can... Can, like, a venture capitalist just get to give MDickey, like, fucking 60 million dollars?
[39:25.02]You know what I mean?
[39:27.94]And have him make, like, have him get, like, a team of people and... I don't know how many people worked on this game, but, like, this is awesome.
[39:34.51]Like, imagine if MDickey had, like, fucking 40 million dollars.
[39:38.35]50 million dollars.
[39:41.02]I want that game.
[39:41.83]I want to see what that game is.
[39:44.59]Like, why can't M. Dickie just get, like, 50 fucking million dollars to make a wrestling game?
[39:58.76]He probably doesn't want to.
[40:00.32]Yeah, I know, and I'm... Nah, that's... Me saying this is like, oh, imagine if... The charm of having this be the way that it is, sure.
[40:09.26]I hope, I really hope this makes him a decent amount of money.
[40:12.36]And I really hope that he, like, does well and people like it.
[40:14.42]Because, like, this shit needs to be supported.
[40:16.82]It really does.
[40:17.28]Alright, let's end it.
[40:29.04]Get over here.
[40:31.42]Should I change my finishing move or is this sufficient, you think?
[40:43.17]He's been really good at supporting this game on the Switch since it came out in January.
[40:51.98]There it is.
[40:53.06]Oh wait, that was a scream.
[40:54.16]Don't forget the chair that you hit me with to win the match.
[41:04.26]Look at his face.
[41:19.27]Did I injure him?
[41:23.45]No, okay.
[41:23.97]He's fine.
[41:24.53]He's fine.
[41:31.67]But yeah, this is the kind of stuff that I love to play.
[41:40.69]I wish more independent devs could just be total creative control and just get a decent amount of money to do whatever they want.
[41:49.08]We've taken each other to hell and back, Mr. Satan.
[41:51.40]I've had enough of it.
[41:56.84]Why don't we bury the hatchet so that we can both get back to concentrating on our careers?
[42:00.98]I don't know who this is.
[42:07.72]Is it bad that I've beaten so many people nearly to death in this wrestling arena?
[42:13.82]They're all blended together.
[42:14.80]I don't even know who that is.
[42:17.22]Alright, sure.
[42:17.58]Let's make peace.
[42:18.28]Why not?
[42:18.58]Maybe we'll end up working together sometime.
[42:22.91]I've certainly had enough of working against you.
[42:30.06]Alright, somebody said go to database.
[42:35.13]I... Oops.
[42:39.50]It's a handicap match versus Score, Benz, and Kanado.
[42:52.51]No one with money trusts creative people to make creative decisions that will turn them a profit.
[42:55.89]Rich people only care about getting richer.
[42:57.92]Well, that's why I meant like a venture capitalist, just somebody like an angel investor or something.
[43:08.09]They keep putting a bomb here.
[43:20.49]What are the rules?
[43:22.17]What's going on here?
[43:22.75]What are the rules?
[43:32.16]Oh shit!
[43:33.12]Nope.
[43:35.82]But can they both be in the ring at the same time?
[43:37.14]Oh, this should be easy then.
[43:48.09]I just kicked his ass like an hour ago.
[44:02.80]Go get a weapon.
[44:07.08]Reverse it.
[44:07.77]Got it.
[44:09.43]Now let's go for a snap.
[44:13.12]Oops.
[44:17.37]And look, there's also the argument that could be made.
[44:19.43]That, like, if this was changed, right?
[44:22.45]Like, let's say that somebody like this got a team of, like, 20 people to, like, deliberate stuff to.
[44:28.78]And he'd end up being the lead.
[44:31.18]And would it be the same game?
[44:32.58]Like, would it be the actual same experience?
[44:34.38]I don't know.
[44:34.68]That's what the multiverse is for.
[44:49.73]Oh, come on.
[45:02.48]Just a quick head smash.
[45:04.66]Lawless victory incoming.
[45:10.94]Oh my god, I'm unbeatable.
[45:12.54]I gotta get out of wrestling school.
[45:14.50]I'm fighting like fucking jobbers.
[45:19.70]Like, these are the guys that wrestled 25... Like, no.
[45:23.19]I have to get out of here.
[45:24.01]I'm like, I need... This is way above... Below me.
[45:27.97]These people are just training.
[45:28.97]They're just rookies.
[45:32.23]You wonder why I'm hurting everybody.
[45:33.47]I'm not supposed to be here.
[45:35.11]I'm fucking injuring a bunch of rookies.
[45:59.59]I'm going in from out here.
[46:01.97]This is like a PhD going back to kindergarten.
[46:04.07]Oh, my neck!
[46:08.52]That would hurt so bad.
[46:09.86]Alright, get it.
[46:13.25]I'm gonna get out of here.
[46:13.99]I need to go to the roster and approach somebody.
[46:45.21]End.
[46:46.53]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[46:47.33]Go, go, go, go.
[46:50.97]Oh, come on.
[46:53.15]Give them a chance.
[46:55.87]I shouldn't even be here.
[47:01.53]I'm unstoppable, even on 2v1.
[47:03.18]Oh, my God.
[47:05.22]They're trying to get away from me.
[47:22.47]Shitty filler episode.
[47:23.83]Well, that's what I mean.
[47:25.79]Like, okay, like Hulk Hogan used to come out and he would fight like an hour before WrestleMania.
[47:31.18]It'd be like Hulk Hogan versus Steve Anderson.
[47:35.46]And it'd be like a guy, just a regular guy.
[47:37.12]And it'd be a guy just to warm up Hulk Hogan.
[47:39.80]These are like the warm-up guys.
[47:41.18]Like, and I really shouldn't be here.
[47:50.11]I'm gonna hurt him, I think.
[47:51.03]I hope I don't.
[47:57.19]Yeah, they're called Jabras.
[47:58.53]I know, that's what I'm saying.
[47:59.55]Like, I feel like this is, like, I'm just against, like, the warm-up crew.
[48:03.45]Yet they still want to continue to fight.
[48:21.63]There's five minutes remaining.
[48:23.57]They're just taking constant punishment.
[48:25.51]That guy, I heard a rib break.
[48:27.64]Something broke.
[48:34.52]I need a more violent finisher.
[48:36.82]Maybe that'll help.
[48:37.40]You're not going to test of strength, Mr. Staten.
[48:48.95]I'm sorry.
[48:49.39]That's not happening.
[48:52.18]I gotta get this guy out of the ring.
[48:53.50]He's a huge problem.
[48:55.24]Just get the fuck out of here.
[49:08.15]Oh my god, my arm!
[49:15.32]Wait, who's pinning who?
[49:16.68]Who's pinning who?
[49:17.76]Did I just get pinned?
[49:20.22]What happened?
[49:20.83]They sandwiched me.
[49:22.37]They sandwiched me.
[49:29.43]What?
[49:31.88]I couldn't move.
[49:33.24]He had me stuffed in a fucking sandwich.
[49:37.84]Too good.
[49:43.03]He used the other guy's lifeless body to squish me together and the other guy was holding me back.
[49:50.66]I couldn't even, my character couldn't even move.
[49:52.66]Lost in the choppers.
[50:01.70]Jeremy, you suck.
[50:02.58]Just throw all connected internet devices into the ocean.
[50:05.88]No, you saw how much I was kicking their ass the whole time.
[50:14.69]What the fuck?
[50:15.31]Somebody just give me a contract so I can get out of here.
[50:20.27]Oh, he's going to Maple Leaf Grappling.
[50:23.17]We know a guy from there.
[50:24.03]Nice to meet you, Mr. Satan.
[50:29.28]We invited you here to discuss working for Strong Style Wrestling.
[50:34.50]Alright.
[50:36.50]You're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we consider bringing you in with this deal.
[50:40.73]Oh, come on.
[50:49.13]Four weeks?
[50:49.87]Come on, dude.
[50:50.45]Alright, you give me a fucking thousand dollars.
[50:53.21]Do not waste my goddamn time.
[50:59.39]You may have commanded that much in the past, but I'm afraid those days are behind you now.
[51:03.93]No, what you're referring to is a contract that I signed and they took away from me in five seconds.
[51:08.26]What the fuck?
[51:14.23]Is it because I just lost to those two guys?
[51:16.21]Is it because I just lost to the two jobbers?
[51:17.51]Is that why?
[51:18.39]You saw that on TV?
[51:20.45]That's why.
[51:20.75]There's an explanation there.
[51:22.89]They sandwiched me.
[51:25.51]I got... Whatever.
[51:31.25]Welcome to Strong Style Wrestling.
[51:33.67]Let's go.
[51:36.33]Of course, your friend Crucial Kennedy is also welcome to join you on the same terms.
[51:41.45]I don't care about what Crucial Kennedy does.
[51:45.47]Have you ever heard of a wrestler called Matty McFly from All American Wrestling?
[51:49.76]What's this?
[51:52.98]Well, I think we could do the gimmick better.
[51:55.46]So how would you like to be our version of him?
[52:02.64]Oh, they like changed me.
[52:09.47]Should I imitate Matty McFly?
[52:13.30]What did they do to me?
[52:14.22]They shaved my mustache.
[52:24.02]No, I don't want to imitate anybody.
[52:25.75]I'm Mr. Satan, god damn it.
[52:29.27]Sorry, did I make it sound like you had a choice?
[52:30.73]We need you to be more like him, so make it happen.
[52:36.33]I have to be Mr. What?
[52:40.45]They changed my outfit?
[53:00.82]Hardcore match versus Calvin whatever and I bet I've had to shave my mustache and put a new costume on It's just for four weeks, okay
[53:17.49]Alright, now I'm... Wait, is this for me to change, like, my identity or something?
[53:23.37]Because, like, I'm the guy that killed, like, three people in the ring.
[53:27.14]Do I shave my mustache, come back with new music?
[53:33.54]What is this new music?
[53:34.46]I can't... Whoa.
[53:53.53]You're a long way from home, Mr. Satan.
[53:55.09]You should have stayed at wrestling school.
[53:58.33]You may have been a big fish in that small pond, but strong style wrestling's too tough for a loser like you.
[54:04.03]This is my yard.
[54:04.90]These are my fans.
[54:05.92]Nobody carves out a successful career here without my blessing.
[54:11.22]That's strange, because I recall... I recall signing my contract with Russell Haystacks, and not you.
[54:19.39]Russell Haystacks can't protect you once you step in this ring, so you better watch your attitude.
[54:26.05]Whatever you say, I'm coming for you.
[54:32.76]You want to see how much of a real animal I can be?
[54:35.66]I don't belong here, huh, Calvin?
[54:38.46]I don't belong here, huh, Calvin?
[54:43.75]You don't think I belong in strong wrestling?
[54:56.41]out of here oh let's go you don't belong in here with me I belong in here with you I don't even know who that is
[55:30.62]into the audience.
[55:39.13]Hold on, hold on a second.
[55:54.29]There's something I have to do, it's very important.
[56:29.51]Hardcore.
[56:35.98]Get that table in here.
[56:36.76]Let's go.
[56:45.26]Goodbye.
[56:47.24]And now he's going through a table and I'm going to end it.
[56:55.72]Get away from me.
[56:57.10]Midnight's over here trying to fight me.
[56:59.96]Wasn't even my fault that we fought.
[57:01.54]We were over there and I just got hit.
[57:16.55]That's not what I wanted to do.
[57:17.45]Alright, get him on there.
[57:18.23]And we're going to end it here.
[57:20.27]Get on the table.
[57:26.93]Uh...
[57:30.05]Goodbye.
[57:33.84]Count it.
[57:38.64]No.
[57:39.28]Still in there.
[57:39.84]Alright.
[57:45.80]Oh, fuck.
[57:46.42]Uh-oh.
[57:46.67]He's got a mic.
[57:47.29]Uh-oh.
[58:00.90]Damn it, I missed!
[58:06.74]Well, he keeps kicking out!
[58:20.17]That's it.
[58:21.09]Pin him.
[58:21.63]Game over.
[58:22.55]I got the respect of... Calvin and Hobbes, whatever this guy's name was.
[58:29.15]Engineer gameplay?
[58:37.20]That encounter established Mr. Satan as a face who has the support of the fans.
[58:41.18]What?
[58:41.44]I got 600 bucks?
[58:55.96]I'm telling you, they don't think I'm the old Mr. Satan.
[58:58.67]I shaved my mustache.
[59:08.53]Literally being a guy with a crowbar brings the respect of the fans.
[59:11.97]Nice.
[59:12.09]Oh no.
[59:13.74]They're realizing that I have to change.
[59:15.02]How would you feel about being called something like... Ryo Mist?
[59:51.43]This is a corporate meddling.
[59:56.28]Oh, I don't want to be called real mist.
[59:58.36]I want to be called Mr. Satan.
[60:02.76]They'll all be chanting that name one day.
[60:04.56]Perhaps I'll give it to somebody more deserving.
[60:12.23]I got nothing scheduled.
[60:13.01]Let's do some training here.
[60:21.42]I changed my name.
[60:33.75]Mr. Satan Forever.
[60:37.95]How's that for a name?
[60:38.93]You like that one?
[60:47.21]Agility is so bad.
[60:48.15]Change him to Hercule.
[60:59.47]More strength.
[61:00.73]More!
[61:15.36]Matt Shulman has renewed his contract with All-American Wrestling.
[61:19.56]Mean Gene has formed a new team.
[61:20.82]Blood Brother has left Strong Style Wrestling to pursue a career at Weekend Warriors.
[61:27.60]Bloody Lee is sad.
[61:28.72]I'm sad.
[61:31.08]They're all sad.
[61:34.14]Alright, Maple Leaf Grappling is becoming popular.
[61:41.61]That guy left it prematurely.
[61:47.24]Mr. Satan Forever has been booked to face Drew Durnham in a Last Man Standing match on the first week of March.
[61:53.54]Alright, this is a submission match versus Calvin's team.
[62:00.83]We have a TV taping versus, I don't know, TV taping.
[62:04.27]A couple of TV tapings.
[62:06.15]And then a pay-per-view.
[62:09.53]Oh, shit.
[62:10.05]Alright.
[62:17.54]They changed my music too.
[62:18.82]I kinda like that.
[62:46.90]You look like Mike Myers.
[62:48.38]I know, I kind of do.
[62:53.83]Calvin's team.
[62:55.19]Submission match.
[62:55.91]What do you got to say?
[62:57.89]Hmm?
[62:58.29]Say it.
[62:58.97]Say it then.
[62:59.43]What do you got to say?
[63:00.01]Say it.
[63:00.91]Oh, you didn't... You brought a Mike out!
[63:02.13]What the fuck?
[63:07.23]Okay.
[63:07.75]Well, he's ready.
[63:13.35]Submission match?
[63:14.01]That's my specialty.
[63:17.15]Didn't know if you knew that.
[63:26.31]Get up!
[63:26.65]What the fuck?
[63:27.09]I just did a move to him.
[63:35.05]Your specialty is murder.
[63:37.09]And submission moves.
[63:41.56]No, that's not the move I wanted to do!
[63:42.90]I'm trying to do the super kick.
[63:43.86]What the fuck?
[63:45.75]I... What?
[63:47.32]Why did he do that?
[63:50.22]I just tried to do the super kick.
[63:51.46]Did they change my moves?
[63:56.32]Hold on a minute.
[63:58.40]Yeah, guys.
[63:58.72]I don't have the super kick anymore.
[64:00.58]They changed my moves.
[64:01.64]Are you serious?
[64:09.43]I didn't have that before.
[64:14.04]I don't like this new character.
[64:15.78]I want to be Mr. Satan forever.
[64:17.38]I got nerfed.
[64:29.79]All my moves that I was good with.
[64:31.75]Oh, fuck.
[64:34.67]Real mist sucks.
[64:44.50]Oh shit.
[64:51.20]Oh my god.
[64:52.07]I have to resort to just like violence.
[65:08.15]No, why am I attacking her?
[65:09.58]Why was I aiming at her?
[65:14.71]Alright, let's pull this together here.
[65:22.93]Yeah, they gave me just shitty default wrestling moves.
[65:26.13]None of my cool moves are here anymore.
[65:30.08]And they don't do any damage.
[65:34.14]I have to just rely on my strength.
[65:46.47]Just rely on my strength.
[65:47.99]Striking moves.
[65:49.53]Small moves.
[65:50.57]Punches.
[65:51.03]Kicks.
[65:52.79]Weapons.
[65:53.91]Yeah, rely on the strength.
[65:54.95]If they're going to take shit away from me, do what I know I can do best.
[65:58.71]They can't take this away from me.
[66:06.55]You can't take it away from me.
[66:07.55]Yeah, go ahead and fold me up.
[66:12.78]That's fine.
[66:17.87]Ow.
[66:21.87]I need to use my rage.
[66:23.29]I do.
[66:26.89]This is such a bad arc for Mr. Satan.
[66:34.61]Get back in the ring.
[66:35.23]Get back in the ring.
[66:35.79]Don't get counted out.
[66:36.47]Come on.
[66:45.73]What are you doing?
[66:47.25]What?
[66:47.49]How did that miss?
[66:49.17]That's impossible.
[66:50.15]I'm as big as the side of the ring.
[66:52.27]I just won?
[66:56.57]No!
[67:02.70]How did that miss?
[67:12.80]Use your strength.
[67:25.09]Oh, I did all this for money.
[67:26.71]I had to change my character, change my moves.
[67:31.17]So I would stop beating up fucking rookies.
[67:34.11]They have to nerf me and take... But yeah, you can't take it all away from me though.
[67:55.81]Oh, yeah.
[67:56.39]Now you know my plan.
[67:57.92]You can't take the striking away from me.
[67:59.84]Now you're afraid.
[68:01.18]That's fine.
[68:04.56]Don't worry.
[68:05.14]I'd be afraid, too.
[68:06.38]If I had to hit him with these fucking punches in the face.
[68:15.03]Really?
[68:15.27]Really?
[68:25.22]I was on the ground for so long.
[68:26.30]Don't let him submit me.
[68:29.77]It's alright.
[68:30.07]I'm too big.
[68:36.49]Alright.
[68:36.79]Now let's... This is going to hurt a lot.
[68:38.79]Hurt him.
[68:42.37]Yep.
[68:43.68]Lean into it.
[68:46.30]Lean into it.
[68:48.72]Come on.
[68:51.90]Oh, I'm arching so far back.
[68:57.87]Ugh!
[69:04.14]Wrench it!
[69:05.88]Wrench it!
[69:10.76]Is his health going down?
[69:21.94]Submit.
[69:25.73]He didn't submit.
[69:31.55]You will this time.
[69:32.93]You know why?
[69:33.37]Because it's time for the Mr. Satan bear hug.
[69:38.62]Get up here.
[69:39.84]Here, you want me to change my voice?
[69:42.10]I'm about to change yours permanently.
[69:45.40]That's not my move anymore.
[69:47.18]That's not my move anymore.
[69:48.20]That's not my move anymore.
[69:49.06]That's not my move anymore.
[69:49.90]That move sucks.
[69:56.98]They made my move a kneeling chin drop?
[70:03.40]Oh my god, how am I gonna make this guy submit?
[70:08.25]Come on, pull it off!
[70:11.09]Come on!
[70:12.17]Oh my god, no!
[70:15.31]No!
[70:20.73]Come on!
[70:23.38]Get him!
[70:26.50]I don't know what move is gonna work on him.
[70:28.46]Look at his ankle!
[70:37.58]I have to get him by the head.
[70:44.48]No.
[70:44.98]Get back in here.
[70:47.02]By the head.
[70:48.95]This is the way this is gonna work.
[70:53.79]Just pull it.
[70:54.99]Pull!
[70:55.87]Harder!
[71:01.01]Go!
[71:05.59]Oh my God, why can't I get this guy?
[71:11.17]What?
[71:14.29]I've been so nerfed for money.
[71:17.34]It wasn't worth it.
[71:18.12]No!
[71:36.51]Alright, give me his leg again.
[71:37.43]Give me the legs.
[71:41.52]Let's go.
[71:44.76]You can't possibly take this much longer.
[71:46.92]You seriously can't.
[71:49.08]There it is!
[71:57.07]That was intense.
[72:01.41]Alvin's steam status has not been affected.
[72:02.93]Mr. Satan's status has not been affected.
[72:08.49]What?
[72:17.34]They're trying to hold me down.
[72:18.30]That's really what's going on.
[72:19.10]Okay, my contract with StrongStyle expires next week.
[72:26.94]This is the last appearance potentially.
[72:28.38]You're going to re-sign me?
[72:34.58]Mr. Satan Forever, what do you think of a new outfit for your wardrobe department created for you?
[72:38.26]Here's a blue diaper.
[72:50.89]Sure.
[72:52.73]I knew you'd like it.
[72:53.71]A change of image could just be what you need to stand out.
[73:03.97]They're trying to make me as generic as possible.
[73:09.97]Roster.
[73:10.49]Okay, so... Where's the owner?
[73:15.51]Who owns A.A.W.?
[73:17.16]This guy?
[73:21.66]What do you want, Mr. Satan Forever?
[73:22.80]This better be worth my time.
[73:23.92]I'd like to work with you.
[73:35.44]How do you see us working together?
[73:39.74]Well, uh... You really remind me of the McDLT briefcase guy.
[73:45.35]So... I mean, I... I really got gravitating towards you.
[73:51.25]Would you be my partner?
[73:57.53]We don't even work for the same company, so I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[74:00.94]Alright, who owns this company?
[74:09.74]Who owns the company?
[74:17.60]Manager fool.
[74:18.81]Manager fool.
[74:21.35]No, no, no.
[74:22.21]It's not the same type of manager.
[74:24.29]The manager is the guy that just comes out with you to the ring.
[74:27.57]Not like, manage me.
[74:28.79]I want to be in your company.
[74:31.90]It's either like, let's be a tag team or you come out to the ring with me.
[74:37.08]Who owns AAW?
[74:41.04]The owner.
[74:45.96]He does.
[74:46.70]Oh.
[74:49.66]Russell Haystacks.
[74:53.84]This guy owns this company.
[74:54.96]What do you want, Mr. Satan?
[74:55.82]It's better be worth my time.
[74:58.02]Can I challenge him to a fight and just kick the ever-living shit out of him?
[75:07.40]Sorry, I don't think of myself as a wrestler.
[75:08.92]Perhaps you should ask somebody else.
[75:15.16]Alright, what about Derek Switchoff?
[75:25.41]Federation Online.
[75:28.45]Weekend Warriors.
[75:33.03]Thomas Sun.
[75:37.19]Matt Dickey?
[75:37.99]Alright, let's see, let's uh... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[75:46.01]Maple Leaf Grappling.
[75:47.21]Where's the owner?
[75:48.95]Heaven Lee Bobby is the owner of Maple Leaf Grappling.
[75:54.47]What do you want, Mr. Satan?
[75:55.41]This better be worth it.
[75:57.50]Um, I want to work with you.
[75:58.68]How do you see us working together?
[76:03.56]Can you be my manager?
[76:07.43]We don't even work for the same company.
[76:08.91]Oh god dammit.
[76:12.53]I'm not free yet.
[76:13.51]Okay, I see, I see.
[76:14.42]Alright, this is my last week as Mr. Satan Forever with different clothes on.
[76:19.54]Okay, here we go.
[76:23.00]This is just a singles match.
[76:23.92]My last match and I'll be free.
[76:37.64]I don't think I can change them.
[76:40.02]Until I'm free.
[76:48.29]Anton Apex.
[76:54.33]Okay, I just tried to throw the mic at him and it missed by probably an inch.
[76:57.92]Okay.
[77:07.66]As you may have heard the news, my contract with Strong Style Wrestling expires next week.
[77:15.60]If Russell Haystacks and I can't come to an agreement, this might very well be my last appearance.
[77:23.13]In case that happens, I want to take this opportunity to express how much I've enjoyed wrestling for you.
[77:30.67]I've had a lot of ups and downs in this ring, as well as behind the scenes, but I have no regrets.
[77:38.51]Anyway, I'm not out of here yet.
[77:39.83]There's one last ass to kick, so let's make it a memorable one.
[77:44.45]This guy right now is going like, this guy kills people in the ring.
[77:49.46]What does he mean?
[77:52.18]Why does it have to be me that had to be on this roster tonight?
[77:58.90]Mr. Satan just said he wanted to make it a memorable one.
[78:01.13]Wow.
[78:10.36]Did he just throw dirt in my face?
[78:17.22]Death imminent.
[78:19.18]No, I'm not going to kill this guy.
[78:21.00]No, I'm not going to hurt you.
[78:27.66]I'm just going to kill you real... I did it wrong, but you know what?
[78:30.44]I'm not going to kill you.
[78:32.06]I'm going to hurt you real bad.
[78:38.61]We have deleted 12 and a half minutes of footage of Jared Leto's Joker.
[78:42.85]And he's never to be heard from again.
[78:44.11]Just use the strength.
[79:02.72]That's all I have to do.
[79:03.34]He can't even hurt me.
[79:08.80]Notice how they changed my moves from being punches to kicks.
[79:13.05]Mm-hmm.
[79:15.25]I only have, like, one upper punch in the face, and that's it.
[79:20.95]Thought that was a Shining reference.
[79:26.01]Wait.
[79:28.15]That's not from Suicide Squad.
[79:34.02]Is that Jack Nicholson?
[79:41.42]It is.
[79:41.94]Yeah, it is, right?
[79:44.22]It's been both?
[79:46.90]It's from the Dark Knight?
[79:50.33]Is it?
[79:51.51]No, it's not.
[79:52.25]Wait, who says that?
[80:04.22]No, that's him.
[80:05.36]That was in the trailer.
[80:19.79]Alright, this guy was... What a not very memorable final match for this studio.
[80:25.99]For strong wrestling, whatever it is.
[80:27.53]Yeah, what a shit ending to my career here.
[80:35.27]It's just like a regular match.
[80:36.40]Nothing crazy happens.
[80:49.50]You're thinking of another scene.
[80:50.86]No, I'm not.
[80:52.10]Maybe I am.
[80:54.46]Make it memorable.
[80:55.18]Go after the announcers.
[80:57.74]Ah, shit.
[80:58.28]This is not very memorable at all.
[80:59.92]I may as well throw a 2x4 at the announcer's head.
[81:17.83]Fine.
[81:23.81]Hey, Money Mark.
[81:25.34]Smile.
[81:26.56]You're on Game Boy Camera.
[82:09.98]Ow.
[82:14.75]T-pose, T-pose, T-pose, T-pose.
[82:18.01]No, knock him out.
[82:18.85]Reverse.
[82:27.46]I don't think anyone besides you likes this game.
[82:30.62]Oh.
[82:31.98]You know, when somebody... I'm sorry, dude, but like... That's just so... That was like a just incorrect statement.
[82:38.36]And that, I mean, you might... I don't know, man.
[82:39.90]I think you might be the first person to say that.
[82:47.87]No, I'm... Most people are.
[82:50.83]I mean, if you don't like it, whatever.
[82:52.01]That's cool.
[82:52.81]That doesn't bother me.
[82:54.82]You don't have to like the same things.
[82:56.52]But holy shit, this is like my favorite game ever.
[83:01.75]What a not memorable match.
[83:04.05]Quick!
[83:04.41]I gotta make it memorable quick.
[83:12.39]Damn it!
[83:20.86]I improved considerably.
[83:25.69]We don't know how to like the same thing, that doesn't matter.
[83:27.81]Alright, am I gonna get a contract?
[83:41.84]King David has defeated Air Miles.
[83:45.22]That's mankind, right?
[83:46.40]But it's not.
[83:55.78]Okay.
[83:57.38]Mr. Satan, Forever's contract with the Strong Style Wrestling has expired.
[84:00.16]I'm going to meet with Russell Haystacks to discuss his future.
[84:08.30]Okay.
[84:10.24]I... That... I want to see that.
[84:15.21]That's the coolest wrestler I've seen so far.
[84:16.61]I want to see that costume.
[84:19.77]A lot happened this week.
[84:23.07]Oh, my.
[84:24.21]Mr. Satan Forever has been booked to face Abysmal in an 18-man countdown elimination match?
[84:32.44]I thought that was a typo.
[84:35.46]18 man in the same ring?
[84:37.62]Or is that... Oh, is it like Royal Rumble?
[84:42.08]Your contract has expired, Mr. Satan, so we need to talk about your future.
[84:49.70]We're pleased with your progress, so we'd be happy to keep you on with this deal.
[84:52.92]This better be good.
[84:58.69]Okay.
[84:59.35]Oh.
[85:00.15]Wow.
[85:00.57]All right.
[85:01.49]All right.
[85:01.77]This is big.
[85:02.83]This is 20 grand right now.
[85:04.01]This is $1,100 a week.
[85:05.31]No clauses.
[85:07.81]I want creative control.
[85:13.00]Creative control.
[85:13.62]All right.
[85:16.34]We can't trust you with creative control.
[85:17.80]Only we know what's best for your career.
[85:30.67]There's no bullshit in there anymore.
[85:32.46]I can do whatever I want.
[85:33.28]Have you ever worked with a wrestler called Alan Gator here at Strong Style Wrestling?
[85:46.18]His contract is up for renewal soon, so we'd be interested to know if you have any feedback.
[85:50.62]I don't know who this person is.
[85:53.08]Alan Gator.
[85:59.43]We need to keep Alan Gator.
[86:02.73]He brings a lot to the wrestling.
[86:05.14]We'll do our best to keep him at Strong Style Wrestling.
[86:09.36]He wrestles Gators, for God's sakes.
[86:12.50]Sorry to bother you, Mr. Satan, but I've been struggling with my finances.
[86:15.70]What?
[86:16.50]Is this Alan Gator?
[86:20.23]Since we're such good friends, do you think you can lend me $1,300 to get back on my feet?
[86:23.37]Oh...
[86:29.23]Oh, no.
[86:32.86]Oh.
[86:39.46]Alright.
[86:40.52]Alright.
[86:42.83]Thanks, Mr. Satan.
[86:43.57]This will help a lot.
[86:44.17]I hope I can return the favor sometime.
[86:46.39]You could.
[86:48.57]Oh, and I'll be asking for it.
[86:52.54]Singles versus Calvin Steam.
[86:54.70]And then here's that 18-man countdown.
[86:56.54]All right.
[86:57.22]I hope I'm in shape for that.
[86:58.71]Oh, thanks, Mr. Green.
[87:04.39]Yeah.
[87:09.47]Oh, I can change my shit again.
[87:10.92]Right.
[87:34.20]Just exit and change.
[87:38.38]No, I can look.
[87:39.20]I'm going to embarrass this guy.
[87:41.07]You may have won last time, Mr. Satan, but one win doesn't mean anything in this business.
[87:45.09]No, it doesn't.
[87:45.75]But like four do in a row each time we have fought every time.
[88:04.46]Bats allowed?
[88:05.00]No, they're not.
[88:12.75]Hey, well, look.
[88:13.35]I might have a new friend in Alan Gator.
[88:16.97]The Alligator.
[88:23.35]What is that?
[88:23.67]What did he just throw?
[88:26.27]That was weird.
[88:35.19]Mike was on the ground.
[88:36.01]Oh, right.
[88:41.80]In.
[88:42.60]Make it quick.
[88:46.46]Give us what we came for.
[88:47.22]Where's Otto?
[88:49.34]You'll see Otto.
[88:54.61]I tell you.
[88:55.65]You will see Otto.
[88:57.45]Before this stream is over.
[88:58.35]I promise.
[89:11.50]I love the striking in this game.
[89:22.99]How did I miss going over the ropes?
[89:29.53]Alright, this is it.
[89:30.81]There it is.
[89:31.15]There's my special move.
[89:32.71]Which is awful.
[89:33.33]So we're going to see what my back special is.
[89:35.23]That's way better.
[89:46.11]Jordan Sweet.
[89:55.68]That move sucks.
[89:57.72]Mr. Satan Fervor's progress is being hindered by the limitations of strong style wrestling.
[90:01.83]Really?
[90:04.31]Okay.
[90:05.63]Where's the offer from the big dog?
[90:13.98]I just signed 10 weeks.
[90:14.94]Yeah, that'll go by quick.
[90:17.88]Alan Gator's profile has dropped considerably after being criticized by the press.
[90:21.26]What did he do?
[90:25.11]What did he do?
[90:28.17]Listen, Mr. Satan Forever, I've been keeping an eye on your progress and think some changes need to be made.
[90:31.67]I'm not convinced you'll ever be a champion, which makes me wonder what you're doing here.
[90:43.62]Win a championship by the fourth week of March or we'll have to accept it's never going to happen.
[90:49.88]Well, give me a fucking title match then.
[90:52.32]Give me a title match.
[91:00.91]Who has this?
[91:01.79]This dude, Joel Harden.
[91:05.67]Give me a match.
[91:11.07]I heard you're looking for me, Mr. Satan.
[91:12.61]What do you want to talk about?
[91:18.76]I'd like to... I want to challenge you to a fucking title match.
[91:23.74]Everybody wants a shot at my lightweight title, so get to the back of the line.
[91:29.10]Alright, well, King... What about King David?
[91:30.82]I heard you're looking for me.
[91:35.49]What do you want to talk about?
[91:37.75]I challenge you to a match.
[91:42.60]Everybody wants a shot at my world title.
[91:46.04]Well, what the fuck?
[91:47.05]How about Coder?
[91:55.93]What do you want?
[91:57.88]Tag team?
[91:58.84]I challenge you to a tag team championship match.
[92:01.50]Me and Alan Gator.
[92:12.49]Where is he?
[92:15.39]Where's Alan Gator?
[92:16.35]I heard you're looking for me.
[92:21.59]Yep.
[92:23.71]I want, let's, I want to work with you.
[92:24.95]Let's be partners.
[92:29.93]I want to, let's be, let's work together.
[92:32.51]We're in this together.
[92:33.49]You and me.
[92:35.49]I think we make a formidable team.
[92:36.81]I can't wait to talk out, to walk out there with you.
[92:38.65]Yep.
[92:44.14]Me and Alan Gator are going to stick on the tag team title.
[92:45.94]Alright, well this is the 18-man tag team.
[92:51.01]What?
[92:51.23]18-man tag team.
[93:04.77]Where's my music?
[93:13.65]What was it?
[93:17.86]There it is.
[93:21.36]Guess what?
[93:21.78]We don't have to change our name.
[93:36.61]Can't change this.
[93:37.23]Okay, we can at least do this.
[93:43.59]I want my big attack.
[93:45.51]Not that shit.
[93:49.34]Super kick.
[93:50.18]Give me that back.
[93:52.16]Running front tackle.
[93:53.05]Let's put this back to super punch.
[93:58.97]Yeah.
[93:59.63]Bingo.
[94:00.79]Jabs.
[94:01.41]I don't want a straight jab.
[94:02.98]I want the big one.
[94:04.24]The hook.
[94:05.72]Right hook.
[94:07.12]Right hook.
[94:07.82]Long jab.
[94:11.87]Okay.
[94:13.35]Let's get my... Let's get a better move here.
[94:15.79]Special knee drop.
[94:17.15]Look at how awful that is.
[94:18.15]That is a basic default move.
[94:24.04]We're going for something crazy.
[94:30.32]That sounds pretty good.
[94:31.88]How about just a straight up powerbomb?
[94:35.05]He's the comedy character in the anime.
[94:36.29]As long as I can hang out with you, Mr. Satan, I couldn't care less what you do to me.
[95:06.17]Spear, Spine Buster.
[95:07.47]How about just the tried and true?
[95:11.04]Can we give Mr. Satan the Stunner?
[95:20.77]I think so.
[95:22.71]I love the Stunner.
[95:24.09]New move.
[95:24.73]Okay, fine.
[95:27.33]What's the Sling Blade?
[95:35.24]Shoulder breaker.
[95:38.34]That's very painful.
[95:46.51]That was sick.
[95:49.81]Oh!
[95:52.97]Oh, that's awful.
[95:54.17]I like that one.
[96:00.93]Alright.
[96:01.25]Oh, they changed.
[96:02.43]Look what they did.
[96:04.55]They changed everything.
[96:16.56]They gave such shitty moves to me.
[96:20.10]Yeah, give me these ones.
[96:25.20]That one's fine.
[96:25.82]Brain Buster.
[96:29.34]Alright, that's fine.
[96:32.37]Partner Alan Gator.
[96:34.11]Story friend Alan Gator.
[96:35.37]Real friend Alan Gator.
[96:36.77]All right, we got a real friend here.
[96:37.99]Okay, let's do it.
[96:40.87]I don't think I can change anything else.
[96:45.77]I can't change.
[96:46.55]No, they took my mustache forever.
[96:48.01]All right, this is the 18-man tag team.
[96:52.54]How do you have an 18-man tag team?
[96:54.36]We're about to find out.
[97:02.62]My god.
[97:03.86]This is gonna be fucking mayhem.
[97:08.02]Wait, we have teams?
[97:12.00]What?
[97:16.89]And here's my team.
[97:24.25]Let's go!
[97:27.40]This is a war.
[97:29.32]This is gonna be insane.
[97:30.52]I don't even know what to do.
[97:33.28]There's too many people.
[97:36.20]We're all hugging.
[97:40.64]Hugging each other.
[97:43.44]Alan Gator and I have joined forces to become even greater than the sum of our parts.
[97:48.64]And we brought all of our closest Facebook friends, because we don't know anybody else.
[97:53.66]I knew some of these people in high school.
[97:58.80]That's right, but our actions speak louder than words.
[98:00.96]So let's show these people what we're about.
[98:04.08]Let's go!
[98:10.46]Out?
[98:10.98]Wait, it's only two people?
[98:13.19]How can you even tell who's on whose team?
[98:22.87]Wait, that person's on my team?
[98:27.02]Who's... Oh my god, that was somebody on my team!
[98:31.96]Wait, whose team am I on?
[98:34.95]I'm so confused!
[98:40.85]I can't... Ow!
[98:50.57]Who's this guy?
[98:56.52]That's too many people.
[98:58.94]This is never gonna end.
[99:03.12]This is never gonna end.
[99:07.64]Okay, I don't know who this... I think it's this guy.
[99:10.24]Is it this person right here?
[99:12.30]I don't know.
[99:14.95]I think it's this person.
[99:16.01]I don't know.
[99:16.97]I could be wrong.
[99:20.53]This is fucking insane.
[99:23.62]Imagine seeing this shit.
[99:30.31]That guy was just up here.
[99:33.75]I have a special.
[99:34.79]I already have a special.
[99:37.36]No, I can't.
[99:47.14]It's an A-flex.
[99:48.25]Are you fucked?
[100:00.27]This is like the cartoon shit that I've dreamed about That's not my team my team is over here with Alan Gators the only guy I recognize who's this lady on the top turnbuckle Where am I?
[100:19.16]At least people are fighting
[100:30.17]Who's fighting?
[100:30.85]I tagged in Gator?
[100:33.89]I did?
[100:35.75]Somebody just fell out of the stands.
[100:40.55]I don't think that person was even here.
[100:44.84]Who's playing?
[100:45.64]Am I supposed to be in here?
[100:48.82]I didn't tag in Alan Gator.
[100:52.84]No.
[100:53.08]Oh, shit.
[100:53.51]I'm not supposed to be in here.
[101:04.59]Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
[101:05.55]You pin him, Alligator!
[101:09.85]Who just got tagged in?
[101:17.53]I just got sucked out.
[101:18.67]I just went down the toilet.
[101:21.74]Oh.
[101:22.72]Oh my god.
[101:23.56]Okay, I think... Uh, what...
[101:32.68]Oh shit, everything's legal outside.
[101:34.73]Everything's legal outside.
[101:36.17]Who cares?
[101:37.09]Everything's legal.
[101:39.85]Fuck the ref.
[102:01.81]Okay.
[102:04.70]Um... Okay, I don't... Nobody knows what to do because there's too many... Okay, you know what this reminds me of?
[102:11.90]I feel like a bunch of puppies at, like, doggy daycare.
[102:15.69]You know, just running around.
[102:16.99]Like, some of them are biting each other.
[102:18.19]Some of them are, like, rolling around.
[102:19.27]This is just puppies.
[102:20.65]Like, a hundred puppies.
[102:29.35]There's a commentator!
[102:31.39]How did I get over here?
[102:33.15]How did I get over here?
[102:34.35]I don't even know how I did this I think he just pushed me off He just picked me up and threw me I was getting too close
[102:55.23]Oh my god, I'm on their team!
[102:58.10]What?
[102:59.74]Wait!
[103:04.80]Okay, okay, okay.
[103:06.40]I think I found the strategy.
[103:07.66]This is the strategy.
[103:15.01]This is impossible.
[103:15.99]This is impossible.
[103:19.71]Honestly, it's gonna take... Someone's gonna have to get disqualified because there's no way someone's gonna get pinned.
[103:26.87]Who can get pinned in this?
[103:29.69]The referee can't handle this?
[103:32.05]Are you serious?
[103:34.63]Why can't the referee do anything?
[103:46.52]Get me out.
[103:47.08]I need to get... Okay, he actually is using a weapon.
[103:49.56]He's actually using a weapon.
[103:51.90]He actually is hitting me in the head with that.
[103:58.27]Wait, is it... She's not saying drop it.
[104:01.49]Did she say drop it?
[104:02.23]Alright, I'm getting out.

[104:17.56]You can't... You cannot rule here, referee.
[104:20.16]It's not possible.

[107:56.09]I don't even know what his name is.

[109:32.50]Do you guys feel like that guy in the lower right is not even supposed to be here?
[109:37.52]That looks like somebody's son that they brought.
[109:51.24]He's the legal man, by the way.
[109:54.45]Tag me in.
[109:55.29]Somebody tag me in.
[109:59.55]Alright, I'm legal.
[110:02.83]Oh, you... Nope.
[110:06.17]No, shit.
[110:13.09]Honestly, now I just feel like I'm playing Dynasty Warriors.
[110:19.39]God damn it.
[110:20.11]No!
[110:23.48]This is hotline Miami, yeah.
[110:25.93]This is insane.
[110:32.21]Okay, I need to... Who is it?
[110:34.43]It's this guy on the ground, but I can't even look at him.
[110:36.81]Wait, Demento is seriously injured.
[110:43.11]Demento.
[110:45.77]Demento is seriously injured.
[110:56.36]Give me that chair.
[110:57.68]Give that chair to me.
[111:03.13]I just dropped that on his head.
[111:07.27]I'm surprised he's the only one that's hurt.
[111:09.23]Doesn't that make no sense?
[111:11.94]How can that be the only person?
[111:22.66]I'm gonna laugh so hard if the Dementor ends up, like, coming out and winning.
[111:27.53]Alright, it's... Okay, it's this little guy here.
[111:31.05]It's Money Mark.
[111:34.05]Just keep him in the corner.
[111:36.03]Everybody just stomp him.
[111:36.83]Everybody stomp him!
[111:38.39]Everybody stomp him!
[111:45.14]Alright, here we go.
[111:46.74]Special move.
[111:47.22]Night.
[111:49.12]Night.
[111:55.60]Okay, he's fucked.
[111:56.88]Pin!
[111:59.52]One!
[112:00.40]Two!
[112:01.96]I did it!
[112:12.46]Money Mark couldn't end my streak and nobody else has what it takes either.
[112:31.49]Ugh.
[112:33.15]Alan Gator's profile has improved.
[112:34.69]Here's the funniest part about this.
[112:37.79]Are you guys ready for the 18 in a row?
[112:43.01]Updates to players' cards here.
[112:45.92]Bruiser Olay's progress is being hindered by the limitations of strong style wrestling.
[112:50.60]Oh.

[113:18.64]Ravita's profile has suffered from being on the losing team.
[113:21.98]Demento sustained extremely serious injury in that match and was rushed to the hospital where it is feared he may be
[113:46.64]Oh, the one guy.
[113:47.82]Oh my god.
[113:50.12]Oh, this is... Demento.
[113:51.95]I'm trying to keep it together.
[114:03.00]This is fucking crazy.
[114:05.22]Here, Miles.
[114:06.56]Just the transition to this.
[114:09.31]This is just one guy that got really hurt to like, oh, by the way, Air Miles, his profile suffered a little bit.
[114:14.75]He was on the losing team that match.
[114:17.79]Oh, my God.
[114:20.74]Cass' profile has suffered from being on the losing team.
[114:27.16]Oh, Money Mark's profile has suffered.
[114:35.67]Oh, there are like boogers coming out of my nose.
[114:42.27]Oh my fucking god.
[114:45.81]The music just made it so much worse.
[114:56.76]No, don't twist it.
[115:02.01]Why is there so many?
[115:03.55]Okay.
[115:06.57]I must have knocked over the coffee that was here.
[115:13.12]Jigsaw Jeremy has defeated Matt.
[115:14.70]Who cares?
[115:17.22]Does anybody really give a shit about anything else besides like the 20 people that were just like smothering over each other for 15 straight minutes?
[115:29.57]God.
[115:37.10]Yes, I know I have to win a championship.
[115:40.95]The entire sport of wrestling seems to have suffered a lull in popularity throughout 2022.
[115:47.77]I mean... Oliver Gold as the best overall wrestler in the world.
[115:57.50]Strong Style Wrestling have sunk below Super Lucha Libre to become the least popular brand of wrestling with a rating of only 72%.
[116:13.55]Holy shit.
[116:15.77]Okay.
[116:18.83]I need a title shot or I'm going to get dropped.
[116:31.70]Somebody said, is Demento going to live?
[116:33.12]I don't know.
[116:33.96]I hope so.
[116:38.98]Last Man Standing versus Drew Durham.
[116:51.79]King David.
[116:54.29]Come on.
[116:56.21]Yes, I'm looking for a title shot.
[117:01.71]Everybody wants a shot of the world title.
[117:03.35]How do I do this?
[117:06.62]Go visit Demento?
[117:07.64]I don't even know what... I heard you were looking for me, Mr. Satan.
[117:19.68]What do you want to talk about?
[117:22.83]I'd like to work with you.
[117:26.03]How do you see us working together?
[117:26.95]Can I, like, help?
[117:30.45]I'm not gonna challenge him to a fight.
[117:32.36]You guys are fucked.
[117:34.86]No.
[117:35.42]Like, let's be, like, let's be, like, a group of three.
[117:41.56]Partner, manager will be three.
[117:47.00]No, I'm not gonna fight him.
[117:47.94]Let's, like, work together.
[117:49.15]I wanna help him.
[117:57.86]Okay, well, last man standing.
[118:00.90]I need a title match.
[118:06.72]Oh, let me change the camera.
[118:12.38]Oops.
[118:18.45]What was it?
[118:18.79]Hard camera or third person?
[118:20.09]I think it was hard camera.
[118:20.97]Yeah, it's hard camera.
[118:30.10]Alright, let's go.
[118:30.68]That guy has a... Wait, that guy has a title.
[118:36.77]Does this count?
[118:37.45]Does this count?
[118:37.81]What if I leave?
[118:38.27]This person's not getting mad that I have this.
[119:04.74]Oh, it's because it's the last man standing, right?
[119:06.02]Okay.
[119:16.24]Wow.
[119:25.93]Shit, I missed.
[119:32.51]Reverse it.
[119:41.24]Wait, that's Money Mark over there at the commentary table.
[119:47.56]Isn't it?
[119:52.83]It is!
[119:53.13]Get down here.
[120:07.37]Oh, he got hit three times.
[120:23.95]Get over here, Money Mark!
[120:38.82]Why the fuck did Goku let this happen?
[120:47.64]Oh shit!
[120:59.38]Villain arc.
[121:00.82]I'm not a villain.
[121:09.35]Where's Mr. Gator?
[121:14.81]On the chair.
[121:15.77]On the chair.
[121:17.25]Yes!
[121:19.81]How are you up?
[121:22.79]How are you standing right now?
[121:23.81]What?
[121:36.59]Dickhead.
[121:42.35]How is he holding two weapons?
[121:43.31]How do you do that?
[121:47.24]He's got two items.
[121:55.84]Shit, he got the chair.
[121:57.98]The mic dropped on him.
[122:14.49]Why is this guy getting counted?
[122:15.46]Four.
[122:17.48]Oh, he's on the ground.
[122:18.26]I get it.
[122:18.54]Right, right, right.
[122:19.58]Last man standing.
[122:27.58]Count him.
[122:38.88]Count him.
[122:49.01]Adam?
[122:50.65]I think he threw something into the ring.
[122:56.73]Stop doing that!
[123:04.13]Count him!
[123:11.26]Is there a reason why you're not counting?
[123:13.86]Um... What are you doing?
[123:19.88]Count!
[123:20.20]Are you stupid?
[123:23.37]Count him down!
[123:24.65]Count!
[123:48.04]Okay, like how?
[123:49.92]Seriously, this guy's like made out of fucking metal.
[123:56.86]Yeah, you think I see you sneaking up on me, Money Mark?
[123:59.87]Don't think so.
[124:17.18]What?
[124:17.42]He's still on the ground!
[124:26.25]You murdered Demento.
[124:27.09]I can't believe you've done this.
[124:30.43]Jeremiah, you did it.
[124:31.37]I had faith in you.
[124:38.94]You deserve it.
[124:39.46]You're a villain.
[124:40.08]No, I'm not.
[124:44.73]Stop trying to summon the count from Sesame Street?
[124:57.53]How did he do- what the fuck are you dodging?
[125:00.23]How?
[125:01.69]What?
[125:04.41]Title match?
[125:05.79]Oh.
[125:10.17]Okay, I'm hindered here.
[125:14.34]Allangator's happy that his client won.
[125:16.40]What do you mean, client?
[125:18.98]Aren't we just friends?
[125:19.88]I have a lot of money.
[125:29.21]Okay.
[125:34.31]Okay.
[125:37.21]Oh, shit!
[125:37.81]Vegeta went to Rising Sun.
[125:43.87]Alright, Super Lucha Libre now is the least popular.
[125:45.75]Have you ever heard of a wrestler called Tenryu Mist from Rising Sun?
[125:52.63]I've heard of Ryu Mist.
[125:54.97]Tenryu Mist?
[125:55.99]Wait, what?
[125:56.63]I think we could do the gimmick better.
[126:00.63]No.
[126:01.57]Wait, they cut my hair.
[126:04.34]I don't want to imitate him.
[126:06.12]I'm not going to be missed.
[126:09.94]I'm starting to think I should have signed the real Tenryu Mist instead of you.
[126:12.78]Yeah, you should have.
[126:18.20]Confrontation with Amber Lance?
[126:22.77]I need to get a title.
[126:26.87]Confrontation.
[126:35.72]Challenge for the tag title.
[126:37.08]Every time I challenge for a title, they just say, no, there's so many people in line for this, not you.
[126:52.21]Why am I in just plain clothes?
[127:02.32]Peter Griffin.
[127:11.54]I'm tired of being mentioned in the same breath as you.
[127:13.40]It's time to change the conversation.
[127:15.22]Everybody talks about me like I'm your inferior, but we both know that I've always been your superior.
[127:25.03]I'm sure you would prefer me to stay in the shadows, but my light is too bright for that.
[127:29.04]Don't worry about shadows too much because you won't be seeing any more of those after I knock you out.
[127:49.94]Don't be worried about shadows anymore.
[127:52.26]Once you are unconscious, then you'll be seeing only shadows.
[127:56.82]Ow, why does that keep happening?
[128:01.99]Oh, fuck.
[128:02.43]Get out of the way, Gator.
[128:05.49]Oh, my God.
[128:20.39]It really is Peter Griffin.
[128:26.20]Slowly just changing into Peter Griffin.
[128:28.14]It really is.
[128:29.42]If they give me glasses and the Peter Griffin haircut, then, I mean, this... I can't... You want me to fix that?
[128:36.64]I can't fix that.
[128:44.34]Oh my god, this guy's getting his ass kicked.
[128:52.71]The only damage this guy has done has been me ricocheting damage off of him to myself.
[128:57.65]Oh my god.
[129:08.16]What?
[129:08.40]Did he?
[129:09.08]What happened?
[129:13.60]Did we win?
[129:14.20]I won.
[129:20.37]I have the support of the fans now.
[129:25.27]Maybe people hated that guy.
[129:38.18]Okay, I need a... I need a title.
[129:47.89]We at Hollywood challenge Strong Style Wrestling to an inter-promotional contest on the third week of April.
[129:52.17]Is that Hulk Hogan?
[129:57.00]Yeah, let's do it.
[130:00.88]All right, I'll see you on the third week of April.
[130:03.30]Make sure you're ready because I know I will be.
[130:06.80]Oh, yeah, both of us have similar voices, as you can tell, Mr. Satan and Hollywood Hogan, brother.
[130:14.39]You better need these 24-inch pythons coming for you, Goku.
[130:26.34]Alright, I need to try one more time.
[130:28.42]Jake Obscene.
[130:30.48]Title.
[130:36.34]I challenge you to a title match.
[130:40.46]No, what the f- I'm not gonna be able to get the title.
[130:52.03]I don't think I can do it.
[130:53.17]I'm gonna get released.
[130:57.51]Just challenge everybody.
[131:00.49]Okay.
[131:03.53]Coder.
[131:03.87]What do you want?
[131:06.61]I want to challenge you to a title match.
[131:15.10]Okay.
[131:18.50]Wait.
[131:18.76]Martini is... Is this the women's championship?
[131:23.67]We can't do this.
[131:25.01]Can we?
[131:26.83]No.
[131:28.62]No, it's tag team championship.
[131:29.94]Okay.
[131:35.46]Nobody's gonna let me do it.
[131:36.38]I'm not challenging Demento.
[131:39.64]No.
[131:39.86]Alright, you.
[131:52.33]There wouldn't be any chemistry between us so long as we're both faces.
[132:10.71]Well, I didn't do it.
[132:12.14]Oh well.
[132:16.08]Another organization?
[132:17.40]I tried that before and it said, we're not even in the same organization.
[132:20.18]Why would I fight you?
[132:28.49]By the way, me and Gator, we start every match off with a hug.
[132:35.15]Oh, never mind.
[132:44.37]Back to wrestling school.
[132:45.63]Illegal!
[133:01.18]Illegal!
[133:01.70]Illegal!
[133:02.42]He's got an illegal weapon!
[133:03.61]I was gonna hit him, but she turned around.
[133:10.97]Face.
[133:13.05]So wait, why can a face, why can a good guy not do a bad guy thing?
[133:17.99]You know what I mean?
[133:18.96]Like, I can be good.
[133:20.56]I can be, don't you, we've talked about, even with Fable 2, remember when I played Fable?
[133:24.34]Everyone was like, what the fuck is he doing?
[133:26.80]I can be big picture good, but small picture bad, right?
[133:29.72]Like, I can, like, uh, steal from a guy.
[133:33.88]Or, like, punch a guy in the face.
[133:35.66]Or, maybe, like, sneak around and, like, stab the guy, right?
[133:39.22]But I, like, am big picture good.
[133:52.11]You killed an entire village in Fable 2.
[133:56.66]I... But that was the end of the stream, though.
[133:58.56]I don't think that counts.
[134:03.12]Like, that was not canon.
[134:04.59]I was like, alright, guys, I'm probably gonna end the stream here in a little bit.
[134:07.15]In, like, probably, like, ten minutes or so.
[134:09.35]So, like, at that point, when no longer... It was not canon.
[134:18.60]That was just, oh, it's end of the stream, whatever.
[134:20.26]Like, I'm just talking and hanging out.
[134:29.74]This guy's actually a pretty formidable opponent.
[134:38.15]Get it!
[134:41.85]He died of natural causes.
[134:43.23]No.
[134:46.47]Into the corner.
[134:48.23]Oh, maybe not.
[134:52.45]You can't retcon your own streams.
[134:54.93]Why not?
[135:02.54]Pin!
[135:06.16]What about Demento's death?
[135:08.22]You see, you are making your cannon.
[135:10.26]That's not even real cannon.
[135:11.66]That hasn't even happened yet.
[135:13.08]Demento is alive.
[135:14.90]He just has like a broken leg and he's like hurt.
[135:18.14]Yeah, he like broke his like back or something, right?
[135:22.35]You are saying... Well, I don't think... He's probably not gonna... You don't die.
[135:28.33]You are saying I killed Demento, but Demento is not dead.
[135:31.13]So isn't that the same thing?
[135:32.04]That's the same thing.
[135:35.69]Mento is very much alive.
[135:37.09]So, I'm... Everything's fine.
[135:42.49]He's... No, you don't know.
[135:44.79]We haven't got an update yet.
[135:46.26]There's no update.
[135:47.34]He's gonna be fine.
[135:55.48]This is time to end it.
[136:00.63]That was a simple little match.
[136:10.52]He's running away.
[136:12.44]Fucking run away from me!
[136:20.91]I need a new contract anyways.
[136:30.03]Gator was trying to block me.
[136:35.90]Okay, so now what?
[136:45.36]Okay, glitter arty.
[136:46.88]That's very, absolutely gold dust.
[136:54.80]So I didn't do it, but I couldn't.
[136:57.80]I failed to do, yeah.
[136:59.26]This organization just sucks.
[137:03.77]Slackers like you don't belong at Strong Style Wrestling.
[137:05.73]Clean out your locker and get out of my sight.
[137:07.39]I can't wait to hit you in the head with a chair next time I have a chance.
[137:10.69]More than once.
[137:11.23]Okay.
[137:16.78]Did I lose my, um, match with Hulk Hogan?
[137:29.86]Okay, now I can change my shit.
[137:41.99]Alright, finally!
[137:48.26]Where is it?
[137:48.64]Okay.
[137:49.14]Now I need my mustache back.
[138:18.25]Okay.
[138:19.58]Mr. Satan is back.
[138:26.38]I need the cape.
[138:33.47]Get rid of the tattoos.
[138:34.57]Yeah, I know.
[138:35.11]I'll get rid of them.
[138:37.73]Alright, there's my chest here.
[138:48.09]Or is it?
[138:48.97]There it is.
[138:49.31]Okay.

[138:59.39]Baggy.
[139:00.47]Good.

[139:08.00]Alright.

[139:30.59]Alright, we're good.

[140:23.91]I don't want knee pads.
[140:28.47]Alright, legs.
[140:46.56]Mr. Satan is back.
[140:48.35]My god, that's bright.
[140:56.95]There we go.
[141:04.80]Okay, Mr. Satan's back.
[141:07.38]He's gonna make his face better.
[141:17.55]Big jaw.
[141:20.42]I almost think I like big jaw better.
[141:21.92]That ain't jaw enough?
[141:39.05]Alright, we'll go back to the regular one.
[141:41.25]Yeah, you're right.
[141:43.83]Yeah, that's better.
[141:44.43]You're right.
[141:47.78]to 25 25 25 that's better hair needs to be 20 like 35 35 35 all right mr satan's back casual clothes that's fine referee clothes that's fine doesn't matter
[142:18.07]Alright.
[142:19.55]Mr. Satan has returned.
[142:30.82]This is Dementor's manager?
[142:31.98]You think I care?
[142:36.92]Shank has turned face and is now going to be portrayed in a positive light.
[142:40.45]Okay.
[142:45.49]My popularity and my attitude have gone down.
[142:47.15]Well, I got released.
[142:48.31]I tried to do a fucking... Wait a minute.
[142:54.28]I'm not sure the name Mr. Satan captures the essence of your character.
[142:57.54]How would you feel about being called something like David Petrel?
[143:05.85]David?
[143:07.19]No, I don't want to be called David Petrel.
[143:16.84]Tables and chairs versus the grand abysma.
[143:19.98]Okay.
[143:23.92]What do I have coming up?
[143:26.94]Training versus training session, training session, and then a big public show.
[143:30.26]All right, let's go.
[143:42.21]Gallant somebody that doesn't have a belt.
[143:44.77]Wait, this is a post-graduate champion.
[143:49.76]This is the heavyweight, is this for the belt?
[143:53.98]Ask for a contract.
[143:58.82]Why is he holding a chair?
[143:59.86]All right, I'll challenge somebody.
[144:02.02]Why am I back in wrestling school?
[144:04.34]I'm like the Hulk Hogan status.
[144:15.35]Talk to Jerma?
[144:16.05]He's in the Hollywood roster?
[144:17.53]What?
[144:17.94]No, Jerma's retired.
[144:24.00]While their stock goes down, mine will keep going up.
[144:37.28]You're not good enough to beat me, Mr. Satan, so let me show you where you belong.
[144:41.46]I appreciate the enthusiasm, but this is wrestling school.
[144:44.14]I graduate- Okay.
[144:49.00]I've already been here before.
[144:50.70]I graduated like four years ago or so, and I'm gonna show you I don't belong in wrestling school.
[145:00.67]Oh my god, am I washed up?
[145:02.49]What the fuck happened?
[145:04.84]Oh, my God.
[145:05.59]I don't belong in wrestling school.
[145:07.09]Ow.
[145:11.43]Oh, my God.
[145:12.83]That was horrible.
[145:15.35]No, I shouldn't be here.
[145:16.67]Jesus Christ.
[145:23.80]No, I don't belong in wrestling school.
[145:25.98]I just have to break him through a table and I can prove that I'm good.
[145:41.82]Come here.
[145:44.34]Get up here.
[145:46.94]Get up.
[145:49.08]No, get, it's a tables match.
[145:51.35]Wait, wait a minute.
[145:52.31]I thought it was a tables match.
[145:56.99]Okay, now you, now you awoke the violent.
[146:00.86]Now I'm violent.
[146:19.15]If I run in a circle, I get even more momentum, because I'm sprinting and just gaining power.
[146:37.96]That was my eighth victory in a row, for those of you that like to keep count!
[146:43.89]Grand Visma couldn't end my streak, and nobody else can.
[146:57.67]I am now the champion.
[146:58.73]Okay, great.
[147:00.65]Can I just give this to somebody and leave?
[147:02.13]We're running short of staff.
[147:09.69]Could you do commentary?
[147:12.31]Sure.
[147:12.65]I want to get out of here.
[147:15.44]200 bucks.
[147:16.14]That's actually much more than I was making before.
[147:17.68]I just don't care.
[147:22.36]I'm just going to get up.
[147:23.00]I'm going to go to back the stage.
[147:35.11]Go talk to Jerma.
[147:39.97]Didn't Jerma retire because I got dropped?
[147:44.25]Wait.
[147:44.39]I remember Lucy Lakes.
[147:55.00]Jerma is in Hollywood.
[148:05.39]Mr. Satan will be joining us on commentary to share his insights in this match.
[148:12.41]You know how long do you think this match is going to go?
[148:15.59]It's going to take less than five minutes.
[148:16.83]It always does.
[148:19.67]You heard it here first.
[148:20.29]Let's find out if it's going to be less than five minutes.
[148:26.63]Malcolm Soul versus... Who is this?
[148:31.42]Who's even in this match?
[148:39.73]It's Lucy Legs versus Malcolm Soul?
[148:42.19]What's this gonna play back here?
[149:02.73]Just wear the belt and just... Oh, I'm so scared of you!
[149:05.71]I'm so scared!
[149:10.76]Don't hurt me.
[149:11.66]Is that it?
[149:22.70]That's it.
[149:26.72]I did it.
[149:27.06]I was about to sit down and do commentary.
[149:29.70]I told you, it always is less than five minutes.
[149:44.14]Alright, Lucy Lake's status has not been affected.
[149:47.16]Rupert Royal's progress is being hindered.
[149:50.57]Muher Pelirosa's progress is being hindered.
[149:56.75]Monty Python has left All-American Wrestling.
[150:00.59]All the ratings are slumping.
[150:01.72]Nice to meet you, Mr. Satan.
[150:10.78]We invited you here to discuss working for All-American Wrestling.
[150:15.25]This is the big one.
[150:18.11]We feared you'd be a valuable addition to the roster if we're prepared to make it happen with this deal.
[150:26.63]Compensated for any health issues.
[150:27.97]1800 bucks a week.
[150:30.88]This is good.
[150:32.60]I'll take this.
[150:34.78]This is a good contract.
[150:35.50]I don't need to do anything.
[150:39.36]Let's just go.
[150:41.75]All-American wrestling.
[150:42.89]This is the big one.
[150:45.29]I gotta prepare for this.
[150:53.96]I can get this to 90.
[150:58.36]Alright, nothing's scheduled here.
[151:01.48]No creative control.
[151:08.24]Look, even when I don't have creative control, I don't even listen to what they say anyways.
[151:14.64]Wrestling Revolution have poached Todd Snorting from Weekend Warriors in a deal estimated to be worth $51,000.
[151:20.56]Damn.
[151:20.84]Okay.
[151:28.97]Perfect Sean is sad that Mike Shawshot has left All-American Wrestling.
[151:34.48]Maddie McFly is glad that Mike Shawshot has left All-American Wrestling.
[151:38.08]Gruesome Sharon has left All-American Wrestling.
[151:45.93]Okay.
[151:49.01]Hardgainer is now the champion.
[151:50.61]This is the guy that just signed me.
[151:54.03]I think that's supposed to be Vince McMahon.
[151:58.65]We make a pretty good team, Mr. Satan.
[152:00.62]How would you like to make it a regular thing?
[152:05.02]Easy to get lost in the shuffle on your own, but we can make a much bigger impact together.
[152:08.42]Where's the Gator?
[152:08.98]Where's Alan Gator?
[152:11.90]I already have a teammate.
[152:13.12]Where's Alan Gator?
[152:17.64]Be careful what you wish for, Mr. Satan.
[152:19.12]It's better to be with me than against me.
[152:20.72]I already have a teammate.
[152:27.02]Right?
[152:32.46]Where am I?
[152:39.79]Where's Mr. Satan?
[152:42.17]He's not with me anymore.
[152:42.93]What?
[152:48.47]Wasn't he with me?
[152:49.35]He was with me here.
[152:50.31]Oh no, I left him behind!
[152:51.83]I thought like that- we were partners.
[152:54.99]I thought that meant like they get him too.
[152:57.33]Oh shit.
[153:02.79]I left him behind.
[153:03.95]What?
[153:16.24]Heard you were looking for me, Mr. Satan.
[153:17.74]What do you want to talk about this time?
[153:24.49]I challenge you to a match.
[153:28.57]We don't even work for the same old company anymore.
[153:30.23]I don't see that happening anytime soon.
[153:36.04]I hope I get injured.
[153:40.38]Alright, versus Winn-Stevenson.
[154:02.81]Who am I fighting?
[154:03.73]This is a packed arena.
[154:09.41]But you have the same name.
[154:10.65]You have the same music.
[154:14.93]It's the same music.
[154:17.51]That's just a slowed down version of my music.
[154:26.12]I've waited a long time for this moment and I can't wait to set about achieving my goals.
[154:31.40]You just pitched it down.
[154:34.42]If Perfect Sean thinks he's the future of all American wrestling, perhaps I'll have to challenge for the United States title.
[154:41.73]Or maybe I'll have to form my own team and give battering Ron and Bill Dozer something to worry about.
[154:46.59]In my quest to own all of the gold, I might even chase Becky Lane for that women's title.
[154:56.92]But of course, my ultimate aim is to win the world title and replace Jigsaw Jeremy as the face of the company.
[155:06.03]Sorry to wake you up from that sweet dream, but there's nobody you should be focused on more than me.
[155:09.91]Why are you holding two mics?
[155:15.72]That would be echoing.
[155:17.00]That would be so awful.
[155:18.14]That'd be like... There's nobody you should be focusing on more than me right now.
[155:30.52]Let me show you why they call me the killer.
[155:43.28]It would just be feedback.
[155:44.48]It would just be like... Oops.
[155:53.69]It's all right.
[155:59.49]I'm in the big leagues now.
[156:00.31]I can't fuck around.
[156:16.39]Powerbomb?
[156:18.32]Oh, that fucking hurt.
[156:19.64]Do it again.
[156:26.74]Injury.
[156:34.07]You know, how many times am I gonna do this?
[156:35.79]Oh my god, that's awful.
[156:41.07]That's just an injury.
[156:42.59]Why are they booing?
[156:43.41]What are you, what, booing?
[156:44.57]Is that it?
[156:56.12]Mr. Satan win!
[157:02.52]It's because I'm going after the women's title?
[157:04.60]Well, I just, no, that's not... That's not what happened.
[157:14.43]That was just being in my speech.
[157:17.65]I'm like, I'm coming for everything, right?
[157:26.64]I'm enormous.
[157:27.20]I know, I'm fucking huge.
[157:33.05]Alright, Safari is now healed.
[157:38.96]Tate Madison has been released.
[157:42.94]This is for the World Championship.
[157:44.30]Are you kidding me?
[157:49.42]Four-man elimination versus multiple opponents.
[157:51.18]This is for the World Championship.
[157:56.18]Already.
[157:56.80]Let's go.
[157:58.42]World Championship match.
[158:02.42]Versus Papercut.
[158:12.66]We going for 10 wins in a row?
[158:13.76]I'm going to try to.
[158:18.06]Let me prove myself right here.
[158:21.26]Mr. Satan, this should be with Alan Gator.
[158:28.81]Yep.
[158:41.21]You can't just take my music.
[158:43.65]Win, Stevenson.
[158:47.05]I just won.
[158:47.95]DFCA.
[158:54.35]Uh-oh.
[159:00.57]Jigsaw Jeremy, the world champion.
[159:02.48]That's just hacksaw Jim Duggan.
[159:13.43]All right.
[159:14.61]Why are they hugging?
[159:16.79]What am I doing?
[159:17.97]Jigsaw, Jeremy, you've only remained the world champion this long because you've been ducking me.
[159:22.47]Everybody knows I'm the biggest threat.
[159:24.37]I was just saying how to defend.
[159:30.11]You can't put off any longer, and I'll prove why you were right to fear me.
[159:36.81]Let's go.
[159:41.78]I just like broke his arm.
[159:44.78]Oh my God.
[159:45.50]Somebody just got really hurt.
[159:47.57]Somebody just got really hurt.
[159:49.87]I think was that paper cut?
[159:51.07]Somebody's really injured.
[159:52.33]Nope.
[160:05.50]All right, let's do this.
[160:10.61]Just to use everything I've learned.
[160:11.65]Test of strength versus Mr. Satan.
[160:13.01]Sit the fuck down.
[160:22.86]Bang.
[160:24.76]I rolled his head over that.
[160:34.22]Get off.
[160:34.92]No!
[160:37.40]Wait.
[160:38.06]What happened?
[160:40.42]Oh, I was doing a move to paper cut.
[160:43.85]I think it was paper cut someone that was injured.
[160:52.02]He's running.
[161:01.83]Oh shit, I have a special.
[161:07.89]Oh, they had no match.
[161:09.63]Absolutely no match for me at all.
[161:12.95]This is why I'm the goddamn champion.
[161:14.73]After this match, right here.
[161:22.00]You've... The screams are insane.
[161:25.70]Wait, why is there... What do you mean?
[161:27.46]What's with the timer?
[161:32.54]Timer's going up?
[161:35.14]What's wrong with the timer?
[161:42.02]It's only been two minutes.
[161:42.94]Yeah, why is some people saying, look at the timer, look at the timer.
[161:51.48]All right, out of here.
[162:08.49]I am so strong, it's not even funny.
[162:16.36]I belong with the gods.
[162:22.23]Who?
[162:24.99]What's the next federation?
[162:26.03]We have like Zeus.
[162:27.27]Like Poseidon are in the game.
[162:39.57]Get out of the way, ref.
[162:40.11]What the fuck?
[162:44.91]Oh.
[162:48.11]Alright, it's time.
[162:55.60]We're going to do special to... Here we go.
[163:02.94]Goodnight.
[163:03.78]And then we get you too.

[163:18.52]World champion incoming.
[163:20.14]What, 10?

[163:37.92]Big finish right here.
[163:44.32]lose Stevenson.
[163:50.40]That's it.
[163:51.35]You're not getting up.
[163:53.63]That's not fair.
[163:54.65]Alright, I'm going to make a big finish on here.
[163:56.11]Ready?
[163:56.43]Let's do it.
[164:02.15]See you later.
[164:04.59]I missed.
[164:10.74]Nobody is spared!
[164:23.11]Onto the chair.
[164:23.63]Splash him.
[164:26.31]Oh, fine.
[164:26.83]Get him in the middle of the ring and let's just make him submit.
[164:30.88]I want to hear him say, I tap out.
[164:33.14]That's it.
[164:33.52]I win.
[164:34.60]Champion.
[164:37.62]I am now the world champion of all American wrestling.

[164:51.29]Hahaha.
[165:00.52]Alright, let's go.
[165:01.44]This is it.
[165:02.02]I got $40,000 in my account.
[165:15.63]I saw Jeremy.
[165:16.43]I was going to say, what's with the title?
[165:21.55]Cruiserweight.
[165:23.29]Machismo has left Super Lucha Libre.
[165:27.41]Oh, Petrel.
[165:28.31]Did they get Dave Petrel?
[165:31.96]Now what?
[165:33.26]Ever consider getting the fans on your side to become more popular?
[165:41.90]Um, wasn't I already a face?
[165:46.59]Yes, I'd like to turn face, of course.
[165:49.33]I was already, let's start portraying you in positive light.
[165:51.65]The fans will appreciate a chance to get behind you.
[165:56.03]I think that I just keep losing support.
[166:00.74]Get this to 90.
[166:06.20]90.
[166:07.82]Alright.
[166:16.98]That's true, I become a face and then I do something horrible and then everyone hates me again.
[166:21.81]At the age of 56, Slick Dude has retired from professional wrestling.

[167:24.20]Because then all the punches... I just become so powerful.
[167:37.07]Listen up, everybody.
[167:37.81]There's something I need to get off my chest before we go any further.
[167:41.58]Put the camera a little higher.
[167:44.64]I know I've been a jerk in recent times.
[167:46.74]I've said and done some things that I'm not proud of.
[167:51.52]But I realize we're nothing without the support of the fans.
[167:55.24]Here's the electricity that gives us life.
[168:00.12]With your help, I know I can be a better wrestler.
[168:02.86]I hope I can repay you by fulfilling my potential.
[168:08.37]Are we done with the life-changing crap?

[169:36.44]Oh, no.
[169:37.22]He's giving me an attitude ultimatum.
[169:39.70]Improve your attitude to 79% by the third week of June or I'll give you a spot to somebody who appreciates it, okay?
[169:45.79]We may not like each other, Mr. Satan, but we drew a lot of money together.
[169:52.75]It's him.
[169:53.51]How would you feel about getting me into All-American Wrestling to reignite our feud?
[170:01.46]Yeah, oh yeah.
[170:02.36]Let's... Wait.
[170:03.08]Aren't you Canadian?
[170:09.50]Thanks for making this happen, Mr. Satan.
[170:11.02]I can't wait to work with you again.
[170:12.35]I gotta bring him up.
[170:19.35]Okay, what's my attitude?
[170:21.33]Ten man tag team.
[170:22.91]Another one of these?
[170:26.86]Race against time.
[170:27.94]Last laugh?
[170:28.96]Last laugh?
[170:32.97]Oh, God.
[170:34.77]Is this for the title?
[170:35.59]I need 79% attitude.
[170:41.06]Okay, this is just a mess, so... I need to... Okay, I gotta do... I gotta... No attitude problem here, okay?
[170:47.86]10-man tag team.
[170:55.67]Maddie McFly's team.
[170:59.39]Oh, Jesus.
[170:59.59]Oh, Jesus.
[171:02.69]It's not for the title, okay.
[171:05.27]This is always just such a mess.
[171:13.31]Wait, aren't there 10 people in the ring right now?
[171:18.42]How come I get less people?
[171:21.22]Wait a minute.
[171:21.92]I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[171:22.94]This guy has like 15 fucking people.
[171:33.84]This is not fair.
[171:34.66]Hey, Duke Miniman, can you believe that we've been booked to face each other in this match?
[171:43.53]This is just scripted.
[171:46.49]Yeah, things can get awkward, but I hope you appreciate that I can't go easy on you just because we're friends.
[171:54.06]Don't worry, I wouldn't have it any other way.
[171:55.60]I can't afford to lose this match either.
[172:13.51]Alright, this is so unfair though.
[172:19.32]Look at how many people are in this person's corner.
[172:20.70]This is ridiculous.
[172:27.10]Who's the legal one?
[172:28.70]Wait, it's this guy?
[172:39.41]You're like the Hulk.
[172:40.41]It's fine.
[172:41.89]I really am.
[172:45.63]Alright, it's illegal to use that, but it's illegal for me to drop him on his head on the way.
[172:49.46]You know what I mean?
[172:51.10]I don't think so.
[173:01.84]Dermot, you're worse than Rio Mist.
[173:03.26]What are you talking about?
[173:03.84]I haven't lost a match in like an hour.
[173:05.43]Duke Miniman is so hurt.
[173:11.25]What happened to him?
[173:12.37]He's not even...
[173:19.40]This is my friend.
[173:27.55]It's so stupid.
[173:34.65]I can't, this is, what?
[173:48.70]Okay, get him, get him, get him.
[173:49.78]Pin him, pin him, pin him.
[173:50.46]That's it.
[173:53.90]Hey, welcome to all-American wrestling, Duke Miniman.
[173:59.23]Oh, shit.
[173:59.81]He fell.
[174:10.35]Mr. Satan's behalf has improved.
[174:11.79]Come on, attitude.
[174:16.19]Why?
[174:23.10]He's not hurt.
[174:23.56]We're fine.
[174:33.61]I see you had fun out there, Mr. Satan, but you made quite a mess of the arena.
[174:36.65]How?
[174:38.85]If you ever want to book this venue again, you better pay $100 towards the damages.
[174:43.35]Oh, fine.
[174:43.77]That's... Okay, fine.
[174:44.91]What did I do?
[174:52.86]Need to agree for attitude gains.
[174:55.01]Alright, that makes sense.
[175:03.41]Newbie Nate.
[175:11.26]Okay, have you ever worked with a wrestler called Aftershock here at All-American Wrestling?
[175:17.22]No.
[175:19.34]This contract is up for renewal soon, so we'd be interested to know if you have any feedback.
[175:22.31]What would be a better attitude?
[175:23.35]For me to say yes or no?
[175:27.37]We need to keep him or he doesn't belong here.
[175:29.07]What would be better?
[175:32.37]For attitude.
[175:33.87]Probably yes.
[175:36.49]We need to keep him.
[175:37.27]Look how good my attitude is.
[175:40.16]Alright, I have no idea what this one is.
[175:45.30]Oh shit, 79, almost there.
[175:47.82]This is Race Against Time.
[175:51.50]And it's a last laugh match.
[175:54.64]I think we're about to find out what that means.
[175:55.96]I have no idea.
[175:59.28]I cannot upgrade attitude.
[176:01.10]It's one of the things you cannot do.
[176:02.16]Let's see what this is.
[176:06.92]Last laugh.
[176:15.73]Is it the last person to laugh?
[176:26.04]Okay, Bart Simpson running the chalkboard.
[176:28.26]Keep the attitude up.
[176:29.00]I will not attack anybody at the commentary table.
[176:31.34]I won't throw a weapon at anybody.
[176:32.91]I'm going to just wrestle this guy.
[176:41.05]You laugh, you lose.
[176:42.49]Yeah, but... How does that... I don't understand this match.
[176:49.02]Mr. Satan, you're not popular enough to be a champion.
[176:51.04]It's about time that title went to a real star like me.
[176:56.62]This title is too big for your little waist.
[176:58.76]You're punching above your weight, Jigsaw Jeremy.
[177:01.02]How does this work?
[177:06.77]I don't get it.
[177:07.23]What do I do?
[177:11.61]I don't know what this means.
[177:16.39]Last to get a pin within the time limit.
[177:19.20]What?
[177:19.36]What?
[177:22.93]Two minute time limit.
[177:24.81]And it's the last person to get pinned?
[177:27.24]Or to get a pin?
[177:28.70]Alright, well, let's just hurt him.
[177:30.76]That's all I know.
[177:31.86]Just hurt.
[177:32.80]Hurt other guy.
[177:33.66]You got it.
[177:45.37]Um.
[177:46.69]Am I eating something on the way in here?
[177:54.62]PIN!
[178:03.18]Good.
[178:03.60]More punches.
[178:08.63]He's just trying to get that out of here.
[178:10.31]He's almost ready for a pin.
[178:21.22]I got a full 60 seconds.
[178:22.30]I should be good.
[178:29.94]Get it!
[178:31.36]Um... Um... What are you doing?
[178:36.91]This guy's drunk.
[178:41.65]Really dude?
[178:42.27]Are you kidding me?
[178:43.49]That was it right there too?
[178:51.19]Count!
[178:55.23]Really?
[178:56.83]Got one more chance.
[179:00.21]Special.
[179:00.75]This is it.
[179:02.80]Come on.
[179:04.26]Come on.
[179:06.58]That's it.
[179:11.30]Yes.
[179:11.99]Got it.
[179:13.79]How are you supposed to do this with two minutes?
[179:34.38]Come on.
[179:34.90]Yes.
[179:35.30]Attitude.
[179:44.64]I got it.
[179:45.34]I get to stay.
[179:55.86]All-American wrestling.
[179:56.78]All-American wrestling.
[179:59.04]Maybe I get to move up.
[180:09.22]Wait a minute.
[180:10.76]Wrestling Revolution have challenged All-American Wrestling to an inter-promotional showdown on the first week of July.
[180:20.60]Rising Sun Pururisu profile has risen after pretending to champion a fashionable cause wherever it is convenient to do so.
[180:27.63]I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but okay.
[180:32.27]Congratulations, Mr. Satan.
[180:33.37]You followed my advice and made your prospects better than ever.
[180:37.36]Please accept a $1,000 bonus as a reward.
[180:40.90]Thank you.
[180:42.62]Alright.
[180:44.39]Hardcore match versus Jigsaw Jeremy.
[180:46.13]And then we have a question mark.
[180:47.61]And then we have... This one.
[180:50.29]I gotta make sure I stick around for this one.
[180:52.89]This is probably going to be a big deal.
[180:54.27]Alright.
[180:56.19]Hardcore versus Jigsaw.
[180:57.35]This is a confrontation.
[181:00.47]I know for a fact I'm gonna kick the ever-living shit out of this guy, so we're gonna get this ranked at 90 at least.
[181:04.47]91.
[181:05.21]91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91!
[181:07.79]Yes.
[181:09.91]I have so much confidence that I'm gonna hurt this guy, so it doesn't matter.
[181:15.21]When you give me legality to use a weapon, I'm guaranteed to win every single time.
[181:33.68]I'm just saying.
[181:37.89]This guy went heal.
[181:39.95]Did I make this guy go heal?
[181:58.67]If you pin him without defense outside the ring, you can kill him.
[182:02.73]I don't want to kill somebody.
[182:07.53]You want your title back?
[182:08.47]Yeah, you're a bad guy now.
[182:11.23]That's fine.
[182:14.00]I'm literally going to take this out of your hands and kill you with it.
[182:16.80]Are you ready?
[182:32.93]Alright, no mo- Oh wait, I can beat him.
[182:34.55]I can beat him without any- People are booing.
[182:44.74]What do people like to see?
[182:45.92]Just like, wrestling!
[182:48.46]Alright, let's play to the crowd!
[182:49.76]People are just silent.
[182:55.34]And, like, unhappy.
[182:56.36]What's wrong with my guy?
[183:10.98]Is it a pin?
[183:11.44]Do I have to pin him?
[183:12.98]Alright, the crowd's coming back up again.
[183:21.75]Come on.
[183:22.75]I gotta get the crowd back on me.
[183:24.99]Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
[183:36.48]Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
[183:46.30]All right.
[183:46.68]Yeah.
[183:49.68]I did it.
[183:50.11]I didn't even use a weapon that much.
[183:51.95]So people will be happy.
[183:54.95]Don't touch any weapons.
[183:55.77]Just let them get up.
[183:58.43]Okay.
[184:00.07]Profiles suffered.
[184:03.17]I'm fine.
[184:14.13]New Booker of Wrestling Revolution?
[184:15.99]Uh-oh.
[184:22.61]Pacifist Percy.
[184:28.26]Have you ever heard of a wrestler called Hai Yakuza from Rising Sun Pororisu?
[184:34.26]Um, no.
[184:35.96]We're thinking of bringing him into All-American Wrestling and we're wondering what you would think about that.
[184:40.39]That sounds like a great idea.
[184:42.09]I'm very happy that you would even consider.
[184:44.47]Sign.
[184:45.01]Hi, Yakuza.
[184:45.79]Yes, my attitude is fantastic.
[184:53.12]Jigsaw Jeremy walks around like he owns this place and has been making our lives miserable.
[184:58.52]Huh?
[185:00.73]Do you think you could teach him a lesson?
[185:02.19]There's $1,400 in it for you if you do.
[185:05.93]Can this be retroactively added?
[185:07.61]Because...
[185:09.63]I... I've put him in the hospital already.
[185:13.59]Yeah, I'll deal with him.
[185:16.65]Thanks for doing this.
[185:17.21]It'll be worth it to see Jigsaw Jeremy get what he deserves.
[185:21.96]Wait, what?
[185:28.94]Why is there a person back here?
[185:32.58]Who are these people?
[185:33.46]Why is there a desk?
[185:34.82]Why are you here?
[185:43.41]It's tough I'm in a locker?
[185:44.29]Okay.
[186:02.86]I just don't want to beat him up that bad because people are going to be mad at me, right?
[186:07.34]Okay, well that's off the table now.
[186:18.07]Don't punch her!
[186:19.99]Hold it.
[186:21.31]Okay, we're good.
[186:23.61]I'm getting out of here.
[186:35.04]Wait, no, did I?
[186:35.98]No, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[186:37.14]It's already over, right?
[186:37.74]I already did it.
[186:41.66]There's no timer here.
[186:43.12]Yeah, I did it already.
[186:43.96]I'm good.
[186:44.98]It must have been literally yesterday.
[186:49.97]OK, so that was now it's a tag team versus Mr. Benjamin's team.
[186:58.06]Yeah, we're good.
[186:59.08]I think it was actually yesterday.
[187:05.08]This I'm really interested in this one.
[187:07.10]Alright, let me go to roster.
[187:10.64]I want to challenge somebody.
[187:14.88]Wide tide.
[187:17.92]Should I challenge?
[187:21.91]How about high note?
[187:25.43]Or get a partner.
[187:26.11]Who should be my partner?
[187:31.12]Matt Shoman.
[187:36.30]Mismatch.
[187:39.78]Jesse Bell.
[187:46.59]Mr. Benjamin, paper cut.
[187:50.41]Will Wind.
[187:52.24]Hi, Yakuza.
[187:53.70]Oh, shit.
[187:56.78]I heard you were looking for me, Mr. Satan.
[188:00.34]What do you want to talk about?
[188:03.47]I'd like to work with you.
[188:06.67]How do you see us working together?
[188:09.83]We're partners.
[188:13.23]Aren't you supposed to be the world champion?
[188:15.34]Stop trying to get out of defending your title.
[188:16.90]Really?
[188:19.46]Really?
[188:23.60]Gonna be mismatch.
[188:25.66]How do you see us working together?
[188:35.56]Well, mismatch.
[188:38.02]Let's be fucking tag team partners.
[188:42.63]Why does everybody hate me because I'm a champion?
[188:45.37]Wouldn't you want to work with the champion?
[188:46.95]Wouldn't you want to be on the champion's team?
[188:56.55]Well, fine.
[188:56.97]I'm gonna... Alright, Pyro.
[188:59.29]Come here.
[189:00.41]I challenge Pyro to a match.
[189:07.80]Alright, it's a date.
[189:08.46]Make sure you're ready by the fourth of week of June because I know I will be.
[189:11.16]Tape review.
[189:16.24]How do I... Can I change the rules?
[189:26.19]Versus Pyro's team.
[189:27.49]What do you mean Pyro's team?
[189:35.58]I don't get to make the rules.
[189:37.18]Oh.
[189:37.66]Well, whatever.
[189:40.68]Wait, what?
[189:41.00]Are we friends now?
[189:52.55]Somebody just grabbed that and sprinted away.
[189:59.30]That's like the ultimate foul ball to catch at a baseball game.
[190:02.26]All right, I'm out.
[190:03.60]Run.
[190:15.06]Put that down.
[190:15.74]Put that down.
[190:23.29]I'm sure as you all are aware, we're the reigning tag team champions here at All American Wrestling.
[190:28.48]Wait, why are these guys in here?
[190:31.20]Unfortunately, the competition in this division is so pathetic that we've resorted to finding our own.
[190:34.84]Why are they dressed as referees?
[190:38.84]That's why we're pleased to announce that we'll be granting a title shot to whoever wins this match.
[190:43.89]Wait, tag team title?
[190:49.06]But they're the referees of the... What's... What's going on?
[190:53.48]What the fuck?
[190:57.48]Who... I'm... What's happening?
[191:03.88]There are two referees?
[191:07.32]And they're evil.
[191:09.61]Um, wait.
[191:10.81]Okay.
[191:11.33]It's me versus...
[191:18.60]He's that strength.
[191:19.36]Look at that damage.
[191:20.98]Look at that fucking damage.
[191:22.36]Look at that damage!
[191:27.77]My neck, my neck, my neck, my neck!
[191:28.93]Get him off me!
[191:31.29]Oh yeah!
[191:34.81]That was a sick play.
[191:48.45]Use that strength.
[191:53.17]Piledriver.
[191:53.69]Piledriver on top of that thing.
[191:55.52]Let's get it over here.
[191:58.06]I'm dropping it.
[191:59.14]I dropped it.
[192:04.88]Get off me.
[192:08.53]Oh, get on.
[192:15.77]Okay, there's another guy over here?
[192:22.95]These guys have the... Why do they have the title?
[192:25.81]They're wearing the belts.
[192:28.27]You don't... Thank you.
[192:30.43]Thank you, Lola.
[192:31.90]I appreciate it.
[192:37.40]She's just covering his nose and mouth.
[192:39.20]She's trying to, like, fucking make this guy not breathe.
[192:43.06]She's ruthless.
[192:45.16]I like her.
[192:47.91]She's ruthless.
[192:49.55]Perfect teammate.
[193:04.86]Count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[193:15.56]See how fucking fast I did it?
[193:17.78]Really?
[193:20.02]Count faster!
[193:21.90]Count faster!
[193:34.91]Ooh, right in the face.
[193:35.89]I'm so huge that I have it in his nose.
[193:37.44]The other guy hasn't even tagged in.
[193:43.26]Oh, you know what?
[193:43.86]I should probably tag in.
[193:44.68]Isn't she gonna be, like, mad that... Yeah, here, go on.
[193:48.68]Whoops.
[193:49.89]Is that not what I wanted to do?
[193:50.97]Okay, well.
[193:53.39]I may have just, like, fucking screwed myself here.
[193:55.73]I was trying to tag her in.
[193:57.37]Hola, Lola, Lola!
[194:04.34]Thank you.
[194:13.77]Lola!
[194:22.07]Game over.
[194:23.05]Alright, you gotta watch my back here.
[194:24.29]We're gonna get a title shot.
[194:26.31]Get him in the right spot.
[194:27.55]And then break his neck.
[194:30.17]Alright, that's it.
[194:32.59]Defend!
[194:36.23]Really?
[194:36.61]Wow.
[194:36.95]Alright.
[194:43.97]You're strong.
[194:49.84]But not strong enough.
[194:53.20]Tag her in.
[194:53.74]Alright, come here.
[194:59.63]Alright, she's tagged in.
[195:00.67]I need to give her... You just do like a... Do like a walloping on this guy.
[195:07.98]All right.
[195:08.18]I'm getting out.
[195:08.52]I'm getting out.
[195:08.92]I'm going.
[195:09.12]I'm going.
[195:09.34]I'm going.
[195:09.54]All right.
[195:09.74]All right.
[195:10.00]All right.
[195:10.20]I'm out.
[195:10.36]I'm out.
[195:10.52]I'm out.
[195:10.78]I'm out.
[195:11.00]I'm out.
[195:11.18]I'm out.
[195:11.38]Look.
[195:11.52]All right, Lola.
[195:13.92]Go for it.
[195:16.08]Kick his ass.
[195:18.33]I want to get you some time in the ring so you don't lose anything.
[195:20.07]Because we're going to get a title shot after this.
[195:26.07]Oh.
[195:30.21]Lola, what are you doing?
[195:31.92]Good.
[195:36.14]Good.
[195:36.94]Yeah.
[195:41.69]No, don't tag out.
[195:42.59]Yes, you pin him.
[195:51.22]Oh, shit.
[195:51.48]I gotta get in.
[195:53.76]You dick.
[195:54.38]Get over here.
[195:59.00]We have a raid?
[195:59.58]Alright, hold on.
[196:02.16]Hold on.
[196:02.44]I'll see you.
[196:02.96]I got one second.
[196:03.58]I gotta get out.
[196:05.22]Get out.
[196:05.40]Who is it?
[196:05.74]Who is it?
[196:12.81]Connor Eats Pants.
[196:13.99]What's up, Connor?
[196:18.03]What's going on, Connor?
[196:21.81]Just playing some Wrestling Empire.
[196:23.53]Best game ever made.
[196:24.95]In case you were wondering.
[196:28.57]Okay.
[196:29.55]I don't know what happened.
[196:31.81]But I'll welcome everybody.
[196:35.88]Raid Song.
[196:36.34]Guys, it's 2021. 2021.
[196:39.38]We don't do the raid songs since like December of 2020.
[196:45.73]Welcome.
[196:46.03]Hi guys.
[196:49.61]Alright.
[196:49.85]If you're not going to do anything then tag me in.
[196:53.41]I'm not sure what you're up to Connor but hopefully you had fun doing it.
[197:02.10]Welcome everybody.
[197:03.22]Thanks for the raid.
[197:05.62]Currently the world champion as Mr. Satan.
[197:08.96]Of the DBZ fame.
[197:10.92]Alright, just tag me in, Lola.
[197:11.90]This is getting... Alright, that's it.
[197:13.58]That's it.
[197:16.16]Network Andy.
[197:17.48]I'm not Network Andy!
[197:19.64]I'm not fucking Network Andy!
[197:23.66]Oh shit!
[197:24.22]I gotta get out before they disqualify us.
[197:27.34]Get out, get out, get out.
[197:28.34]I'm gonna get disqualified because of this.
[197:31.84]Get out!
[197:32.34]I'm trying to crawl out of the ring.
[197:34.98]Don't disqualify me, please.
[197:36.96]I'm trying as hard as I can.
[197:39.79]Alright, we're fine.
[197:44.28]Good move, Lola.
[197:45.10]Perfect.
[197:50.56]I'm trying to hit him so bad.
[197:52.12]Alright, tag me in.
[197:53.88]Tag, tag, tag, tag.
[197:55.61]Tag.
[197:57.19]Tag me in.
[197:57.77]Tag me in, Lola.
[197:58.53]Tag me in.
[197:59.03]I want to go in so bad.
[197:59.89]Tag me in.
[198:01.49]Tag me in.
[198:02.97]How do I say tag me in?
[198:06.01]Tag.
[198:08.50]Lola.
[198:13.02]Tag.
[198:15.84]Tag.
[198:16.20]Come on.
[198:16.48]Back here.
[198:16.76]I have to be in the corner?
[198:22.82]Tag me in.
[198:23.68]Come on.
[198:24.08]I'm right here.
[198:24.98]Tag.
[198:26.78]Oh.
[198:30.22]Reach.
[198:30.68]Reach.
[198:31.06]Reach.
[198:31.44]Just tag me in and it's over.
[198:33.42]Tag me in and I swear to God.
[198:36.16]Tag me in.
[198:40.84]Tag.
[198:40.96]Tag.
[198:45.87]Tag me in.
[198:47.23]Get down.
[198:50.08]Tag me in.
[198:52.42]Tag me in.
[198:53.14]Why are you doing this, Lolo?
[198:54.26]What are you doing?
[198:55.80]Tag me.
[198:57.10]I feel like somebody else is playing as player two and then not paying attention.
[199:00.25]Tag me in.
[199:04.05]Tag me in.
[199:04.47]I'm right here.
[199:07.27]Please.
[199:08.29]There it is.
[199:08.95]All right.
[199:09.43]Now I'm fucking angry.
[199:18.07]Just get these right hands in here.
[199:22.25]What is he doing to me?
[199:22.93]What's he doing to me?
[199:23.71]What's he doing?
[199:24.71]Oh my god!
[199:28.37]I do that yoga pose.
[199:30.86]That's right, cover his mouth.
[199:38.42]That seems like so much setup for not that much.
[199:42.70]Why wouldn't you just use punch in face?
[199:44.44]It's so much more effective.
[199:45.86]Oops.
[199:55.85]Get out of here.
[200:12.63]I thought I was doing it to her for a second.
[200:13.87]Alright, we need to get everybody out of here so I can go back to what I was doing.
[200:25.06]Alright, at least Lola participated, right?
[200:33.57]I need to... My special's almost there.
[200:35.57]Alright, let's go.
[200:40.31]That's... I think Lola ran out of energy.
[200:46.45]She was going crazy in the first two or three minutes.
[200:50.01]We gotta end this now.
[200:50.93]And now she's just like winded.
[200:52.35]What is she doing?
[201:02.51]These guys are not going to get a title shot.
[201:04.17]I'm sorry.
[201:06.25]In fact, I'm going to injure this guy because this is seriously... I'm getting sick of this.
[201:17.33]Lola, go back there and... I'm trying... Get the fuck out of the way!
[201:35.86]Cover!
[201:40.87]Ugh!
[201:45.11]Lola has not moved in five minutes.
[201:49.25]I only did that to just, like, make the AI know that this is still a match going on.
[202:02.44]There she goes.
[202:03.02]Alright, finally.
[202:04.42]Snapped out of it.
[202:10.30]Let's go for the submission.
[202:13.90]Tap out.
[202:15.04]Tap.
[202:18.54]Help me.
[202:25.02]She woke up.
[202:25.91]She woke up a little bit.
[202:26.83]That's good.
[202:28.23]That's good.
[202:28.73]She got up.
[202:32.27]It's having the two refs in the ring.
[202:33.43]It just pucks us all up.
[202:43.07]Break.
[202:45.75]Tap.
[202:47.37]Tap.
[202:48.97]Get it!
[202:52.15]Come on!
[202:54.53]All she does are backflips.
[202:57.31]You're making it so much harder.
[202:58.59]Just punch him.
[202:59.50]You're hurting me too.
[203:03.44]It hurts me as well when you do that.
[203:14.45]Do it!
[203:18.93]Do it!
[203:21.23]Lola!
[203:22.77]Holy shit.
[203:25.10]That was unbelievable.
[203:26.14]But why is he still up?
[203:29.50]I'm so tired.
[203:30.42]I can't even move.
[203:31.30]What the fuck is- No, you idiot!
[203:35.54]You idiot!
[203:36.90]You idiot!
[203:38.70]You're gonna make us lose.
[203:40.52]There's two minutes remaining.
[203:42.01]I can't even get up.
[203:46.62]Oh, my God.
[203:49.36]Look at how close I am to a special, too.
[203:51.89]Okay.
[203:52.99]I've had enough about this.
[203:54.23]I've had enough of you.
[203:55.61]And this is going to end right now.
[203:57.55]You just wait until I don't come any closer.
[203:59.53]I swear it's going to be painful for you.
[204:01.27]In the 30... That's it.
[204:11.30]Congratulations, Mr. Satan.
[204:12.52]You've earned your shot at the tag team title.
[204:18.78]But you should be careful what you wish for because I'll turn your dreams into nightmares.
[204:21.80]Alright.
[204:26.45]What was I doing?
[204:44.26]Okay.
[204:45.84]I don't know what I was on the ground.
[204:47.08]That was weird.
[204:51.26]Alright, Mr. Progress is being hindered or whatever.
[204:54.70]Low list profile.
[204:55.48]Okay, has improved.
[204:56.58]That's good.
[204:59.06]She's the tag team partner.
[205:00.00]Have to shock.
[205:10.24]Yep.
[205:10.62]Okay.
[205:12.12]We're almost at the huge event.
[205:13.84]But here it is.
[205:14.60]The tag team championship right now.
[205:18.22]Shit.
[205:18.46]Alright.
[205:22.81]I'm gonna have two belts.
[205:32.27]Who the fuck is that?
[205:44.76]Who is that?
[205:50.64]Wreck?
[205:55.58]Bill Dozer and Battering Ron.
[205:59.26]You never asked her to team up.
[206:01.50]Oh.
[206:03.90]No matter how many matches I win, you ignorant people never give me the respect I deserve.
[206:09.51]I'll teach you some respect by making an example out of these guys.
[206:12.41]It's not about how many times you win, it's how many that wins to define a great wrestler.
[206:15.31]Even if you have trouble understanding that, just watch how I beat you right now.
[206:21.51]No, I want the real partner.
[206:23.87]If I quit right now, that's fine, right?
[206:26.45]And go partner up with Lola?
[206:31.00]I don't... Who is this guy?
[206:36.16]Don't?
[206:37.82]Pretty sure that's... Quitter, quitter.
[206:41.06]I think you lose.
[206:42.00]I don't think you do.
[206:42.60]I think we did this before.
[206:46.66]Yeah, I'm 75% positive I can do this.
[207:04.39]Fuck.
[207:07.02]Didn't we do that before?
[207:10.16]We did that before and it worked.
[207:12.48]What?
[207:17.50]What the fuck?
[207:19.37]We did that before in the middle of match just to go... Match didn't start last time.
[207:25.93]Oh, god damn it.
[207:27.87]Your buddy Alan Gator suggested that you might like to join us at Strong Style Wrestling.
[207:33.40]Come back to us.
[207:36.87]You've certainly blossomed since we saw you last.
[207:38.59]We'd like to bring you back with these terms.
[207:57.01]No.
[207:57.25]Go fuck yourself.
[207:57.79]I don't... No.
[207:58.23]Fine.
[208:00.79]You don't have to pay me $100,000 a week.
[208:01.57]You can pay me $99,000 a week.
[208:09.74]Not getting anywhere, let's just forget about it.
[208:11.08]I'm pleased to be joined in the studio by Mr. Satan of All American Wrestling.
[208:17.83]What?
[208:21.13]So tell us a little about yourself.
[208:22.55]How tall would you say you are?
[208:26.47]What?
[208:29.16]My height is 7'4".
[208:30.34]My height is 7'3".
[208:31.56]I need to know how tall I am.
[208:34.86]I think I'm 7'4".
[208:37.67]Am I 7'4"?
[208:39.67]I think so.
[208:43.25]I don't know.
[208:50.83]How tall is this guy?
[208:51.53]7... 7'3"?
[208:58.27]I think... 7'3".
[208:59.91]That's exactly right, Mr. Satan!
[209:04.27]You obviously know your own body!
[209:06.93]They liked that.
[209:09.67]Everybody knows you're friends with Lola.
[209:11.69]So tell us how that relationship is going.
[209:15.63]Really would have liked to have fucking done the tag team championship with her.
[209:20.63]But I forfeited the match because it was a guy I've never heard of.
[209:26.43]I can always rely on Lola.
[209:27.87]I can.
[209:29.97]Lola would be happy to hear that.
[209:31.01]I'm sure she feels the same way about you.
[209:33.85]Tell us how your training is going, Mr. Satan.
[209:35.31]How agile would you say you are right now?
[209:38.07]Not that agile.
[209:38.89]It's 75%.
[209:39.36]I'm not agile at all.
[209:42.94]That's exactly right.
[209:47.18]I really enjoyed talking to you, Mr. Satan.
[209:48.88]Thanks for your time.
[209:51.68]Steel Cage versus Pyro.
[209:53.26]Alright, but first things first.
[209:58.79]Lola.
[210:00.51]I heard you were looking... Yeah, I am.
[210:05.78]I mean, this is... We can work our way back up.
[210:09.04]Let's be partners.
[210:09.56]Aren't you supposed to be the world champion?
[210:14.27]Stop trying to get out of defending your title.
[210:15.73]So it wouldn't have worked anyways.
[210:18.93]Who was the guy that they paired me up with?
[210:21.51]First of all, right?
[210:26.07]Wreck.
[210:31.32]Whatever.
[210:31.80]Cage match.
[210:32.36]Let's go.
[210:41.07]I've been the world champion for a long time.
[210:42.53]Referees coming up here.
[211:11.88]Hold on.
[211:12.24]Wait.
[211:12.44]Will he?
[211:13.42]Whatever.
[211:20.56]Versus Pyro.
[211:25.66]Yeah.
[211:27.98]You get to hold it.
[211:29.81]You get to look at it.
[211:31.19]It's not yours, though.
[211:37.09]I'm trying to shake the ring.
[211:45.38]There's nowhere to run now that I got you locked aside this cage Pyro.
[211:50.37]Only one of us is getting out of here in one piece and it's not you.
[211:53.87]Well I'm locked in here with you and you're locked in here with me.
[211:59.83]I'm already trying to get out.
[212:06.05]Oh my god.
[212:13.25]That's it I won.
[212:16.92]Wait, what?
[212:18.76]Wait, hold on a second.
[212:21.34]That's not how... What the fuck happened?
[212:26.39]What happened?
[212:26.91]I thought he just escaped the ring.
[212:28.49]You have to escape the ring.
[212:35.49]It's not escape the ring?
[212:41.73]Oh, my God.
[212:42.75]I can't get back up.
[212:43.79]I got to hurt the ref.
[212:49.95]wrong match type I'm seriously trying to climb I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it I'm not pressing any buttons but holding up I swear to god oh no climb come on come on come on come on come on come on come on
[213:21.12]I wasn't pretending.
[213:22.16]I swear to God.
[213:23.88]I swear to God.
[213:26.22]That was legit.
[213:27.64]I promise you.
[213:29.36]He kept falling backwards.
[213:30.70]It kept shaking on me.
[213:36.54]That was insane.
[213:41.95]No, I swear to God.
[213:42.93]If you guys play this game, if you try to climb, sometimes your guy just falls down.
[213:49.49]If you hold up and try... Oh, I couldn't do it.
[213:52.35]Watch, ready?
[213:53.09]It might happen here.
[213:53.61]I'm just going to hold up.
[213:59.72]Okay, I swear to God, I promise you.
[214:11.76]That was Galdrina?
[214:16.69]Wait, from Banjo-Kazooie?
[214:37.11]Okay, it kind of was a Galdrion laugh, you're right.
[214:43.40]Hold on.
[214:44.64]What did I tell you?
[214:45.20]You thought I was a liar?
[214:46.50]Everyone thought I was a liar.
[214:47.70]The referee just did it.
[214:49.52]Everyone, oh, I'm a liar.
[214:50.50]I was pretending.
[214:54.70]We just watched it happen to the referee.
[215:02.99]Yo, get minus two the ref.
[215:14.83]Oh, come on.
[215:17.73]I'm not even sure why did he do that.
[215:22.69]Pull that arm out.
[215:23.99]Yep.
[215:27.75]A little bit more.
[215:30.11]I almost got the special.
[215:33.79]I'm ending this from the top, by the way.
[215:35.11]Alright, everyone's saying, no, don't, don't, don't.
[215:43.61]But I'll be fine.
[215:47.86]Get him on the ground.
[215:48.50]Alright.
[215:49.70]It's special time.
[215:51.06]And I'm going up on the top and I'm ending it with a splash.
[215:57.85]Let's go.
[216:05.31]Really?
[216:05.97]How do you get up that fast?
[216:10.03]Why would you... You're going to talk to me on the mic.
[216:11.77]Alright.
[216:12.01]Let's go.
[216:12.69]I want to do a from the top rope.
[216:15.10]The ultimate top rope.
[216:20.15]Come on.
[216:25.43]There it is.
[216:26.13]Good night.
[216:28.11]No, I want to splash him.
[216:38.16]There it is.
[216:38.52]Good night.
[216:39.38]Game over.
[216:39.76]I win.
[216:40.85]One, two, three.
[216:49.83]What's this guy doing?
[216:54.47]What the fuck was that?
[216:57.11]Why was that guy climbing in?
[217:11.26]Mr. Satan doesn't kill people anymore.
[217:12.66]I don't like him.
[217:16.37]Here we go.
[217:22.50]Okay.
[217:26.06]John Crockett.
[217:27.35]Yep, I remember hurting that guy.
[217:31.79]This is it.
[217:33.67]This is the big one.
[217:34.25]This three-man elimination.
[217:43.62]Demento is perfectly fine.
[217:45.98]Alive and well.
[217:54.14]Checking on Demento.
[217:55.40]Full recovery.
[217:59.66]Let's do it.
[218:04.33]Wide Tide.
[218:05.23]Aren't we in the same... Who's not in All-American Wrestling?
[218:22.89]Who's the owner of the company?
[218:39.20]So who's the... From Wrestling Revolution, it's Infinite Best with Kylie Barrier.
[218:46.86]Oh, give me that back.
[218:58.41]Welcome to the special interpromotional contest between All-American Wrestling and Wrestling Revolution.
[219:05.55]First, representing All-American Wrestling, please welcome Mr. Satan.
[219:13.64]and representing Wrestling Revolution, please welcome Infinite Best.
[219:21.44]I'm Joel Harden of Strong Style Wrestling, and I'm here to be an impartial referee.
[219:29.02]I know the stakes are high, but let's keep this a fair contest to find out which promotion is best.
[219:37.91]Um, but isn't it a three-way?
[219:43.19]It's like a three-way.
[219:44.19]This guy's in all-American wrestling.
[220:00.38]One, two, three.
[220:08.09]On top rope.
[220:09.15]All right, where are you going?
[220:12.47]I don't think so.
[220:19.81]Get out here.
[220:21.23]Again.
[220:28.48]Count him to four.
[220:29.64]Why do I have a four and he has a two?
[220:30.96]Somebody explain that one to me?
[220:33.86]Good.
[220:34.22]Nice job.
[220:43.00]Oh shit, I'm gonna get counted out.
[220:46.38]No, I can reset.
[220:52.14]All that matters is this guy gets counted out.
[220:55.97]No!
[220:56.47]He got in.
[221:05.27]Yeah, impartial ref bullshit.
[221:11.58]Who's... Okay.
[221:15.74]This guy still has his championship belt on.
[221:18.69]He hasn't taken it off.
[221:21.91]It's probably weighing him down.
[221:22.91]Don't you think this is, like, weighing him down?
[221:28.75]Go for the leg.
[221:34.13]Again.
[221:41.74]Everyone's just watching.
[221:45.66]He's got a weapon.
[221:50.35]Dude, you are not going to get a pin right now.
[222:03.54]Nice job.
[222:09.30]You get out there too.
[222:11.56]blinded me.
[222:13.56]I don't know what that lady just did, but it was not intelligent.
[222:19.83]Let's keep him out here.
[222:20.79]You and me.
[222:21.13]Actually, you stay out here too.
[222:30.97]Special.
[222:31.39]He's... Oh, it's over.
[222:35.35]That's a double special on both of them.
[222:36.73]Both are going to get counted out.
[222:38.84]What?
[222:39.04]What?
[222:46.97]It should have been over.
[222:47.65]Throw him out.
[222:59.60]She's going over the top roof again.
[223:05.20]Go ahead, get the pin.
[223:14.96]We got to set him up.
[223:16.02]Because we have to embarrass this other wrestling company.
[223:21.16]Boston Crab.
[223:21.78]There it is.
[223:23.74]One of the most painful things on Earth.
[223:34.55]Hit it again.
[223:39.05]Nice.
[223:39.55]Perfect.
[223:41.41]Legs again.
[223:41.99]Boston Crab.
[223:46.33]Again.
[223:49.65]That's the second or third time that that lady's done that.
[223:52.75]At this point, I think it's fun.
[223:54.67]That's fun for her.
[224:03.78]Nope.
[224:04.20]Don't you do it.
[224:04.70]It's so high.
[224:14.72]It's so high.
[224:19.36]Alright, join me on the, on the, on the conference table.
[224:21.79]Join me up on the conference table.
[224:23.52]Hey, you dick.
[224:32.58]What the fuck, this guy?
[224:34.64]Okay, the guy just lounged.
[224:36.42]I'm in the chair!
[224:38.99]I'm unconscious in the chair!
[224:42.13]Get out of the chair!
[224:43.79]Okay, we need to get in the ring.
[224:47.71]I don't... Get away from me!
[224:52.37]This lady is fucking crazy.
[224:56.78]Who is that?
[224:57.92]I've had enough of you interfering.
[225:01.54]Go backstage.
[225:03.24]She's getting kicked out.
[225:04.86]She's getting kicked out.
[225:06.86]She's getting kicked out.
[225:09.12]Good.
[225:10.87]She's been jumping off the turnbuckle.
[225:14.33]Honestly, she really wasn't even interfering that much.
[225:16.99]She was just hurting herself over and over again.
[225:25.13]Alright, just pin somebody for God's sakes.
[225:27.42]Pin him.
[225:36.40]Get off me.
[225:37.40]Give me that belt.
[225:37.96]That's not even yours.
[225:39.38]He's putting it on.
[225:40.16]You idiot.
[225:41.78]Get out of here.
[225:43.66]Get the fuck out of here.
[225:46.89]Dude starts wearing the belt.
[225:52.73]Alright.
[225:54.09]Go this way.
[225:57.39]Good.
[225:58.45]Now let's go for a neck break.
[226:14.76]No, I want to win, not you.
[226:15.58]I mean, I did... We're on the same team, but whatever.
[226:24.28]This guy with the belt is seriously pissing me off.
[226:26.80]Like he puts the belt on and then he comes in the ring.
[226:28.76]Get him out of here.
[226:30.82]He's been more of a nuisance than Kylie Barrier was.
[226:33.14]That's it.
[226:50.84]What did I just hit?
[226:56.88]Are you kidding me?
[226:58.56]No, you're not going to do that, you fucking snake.
[227:12.09]I don't want to do this to this guy.
[227:13.41]On the belt.
[227:30.60]Grab him.
[227:35.78]Twist it.
[227:37.80]Turn it.
[227:38.94]Bop it.
[227:42.24]Do it.
[227:42.50]Make the noise.
[227:55.69]You missed.
[227:56.45]God damn it.
[227:56.93]You idiot.
[227:57.63]You could have made this so much easier for me.
[228:08.82]Tap.
[228:11.88]Tap!
[228:13.26]Oh my god.
[228:15.00]The referee's not paying attention.
[228:19.97]No attention at all to that.
[228:22.69]Okay.
[228:33.57]That's it.
[228:34.24]Now it's over.
[228:35.98]He's out.
[228:39.07]Good.
[228:41.87]What is Bobby Hill doing in here?
[228:44.23]Holy shit, that was ridiculous.
[228:45.90]What?
[228:46.04]What?
[229:03.13]Um, excuse me.
[229:04.79]Excuse me.
[229:06.65]Excuse me.
[229:09.02]Excuse me Vince McMahon, excuse me.
[229:12.84]I need help Thanks for nothing
[229:39.09]um that's it oh my god what the fuck just one two three
[230:06.19]You weren't any help at all.
[230:07.79]Highly barrier.
[230:08.59]It's almost as if you wanted me to lose.
[230:10.04]Where is this guy?
[230:10.80]Under the ring?
[230:11.36]Did he go under the ring?
[230:15.96]I think he rolled underneath.
[230:29.49]Oh, shit.
[230:39.81]Who's the guy that eliminated first?
[230:41.57]Oh, maybe he ran backstage.
[230:43.95]Is this the Steam version?
[230:44.95]This is the Steam version.
[230:47.27]This is the Steam remastered edition.
[230:53.50]This is Wrestling Empire.
[230:54.64]This is not Wrestling Revolution 3D.
[230:56.68]This is new.
[230:58.68]This is a remastered version of that game, if you're curious.
[231:04.46]By the same guy.
[231:12.86]Okay.
[231:14.78]Online polls.
[231:16.84]Non-title Last Man Standing.
[231:18.16]Alright, the pay-per-view is coming up.
[231:31.91]91.
[231:31.93]90 strength.
[231:32.89]Okay.
[231:34.51]Is it auto time?
[231:36.59]Not quite yet.
[231:37.95]I'm still... I'm still into it.
[231:46.91]We'll see.
[231:47.51]I don't know how much longer we're going to go, but I'm still having a lot of fun.
[231:50.97]This game is so much fun.
[231:54.24]Oh shit, it's Duke Miniman.
[232:05.52]What an idiot.
[232:10.21]What is he doing?
[232:19.10]What was that for?
[232:32.30]Oh, wow.
[232:33.24]It looks good on me, doesn't it?
[232:34.68]I'm putting this guy in the hospital.
[232:52.17]You challenged me to a hardcore match.
[232:53.71]What are you... I... Oh, no.
[233:09.18]I don't think he's going to get up.
[233:16.12]Stop it.
[233:16.58]Stop it.
[233:17.02]Kill him.
[233:17.66]No.
[233:18.61]Look...
[233:27.76]Don't they know I'm the master of hardcore?
[233:30.76]Why would you challenge me to a hardcore match?
[233:32.50]What are you doing?
[233:33.18]You're not a hardcore wrestler.
[233:35.27]Look.
[233:35.41]You haven't even resorted to biting me yet.
[233:38.21]How would you know?
[233:38.87]You don't know what you're doing.
[233:41.27]One.
[233:41.37]Two.
[233:41.47]Three.
[233:41.59]Four.
[234:13.70]What's happening?
[234:16.56]What's going on?
[234:18.06]Who turned the lights off?
[234:20.70]Who's this?
[234:21.14]Who is this?
[234:26.36]Who is he?
[234:26.86]What is he doing?
[234:30.62]Redneck Rothstein.
[234:34.96]I don't... Does he have a problem with the ref?
[234:41.61]Why did you turn the lights off?
[234:47.11]I need to know what this guy's deal is.
[234:51.83]What's his problem?
[234:52.71]Why did he interfere?
[234:53.83]I'm so confused.
[234:57.63]I mean, this is a joke at this point.
[235:00.89]Like, this guy's fucking... I'm gonna kill this guy.
[235:03.69]Who is Redneck Rothstein?
[235:05.24]And I'm about to hurt him.
[235:15.60]Stay down.
[235:47.03]I'm here from Hollywood to challenge All-American Wrestling to an inter-promotional showdown.
[235:54.57]If you've got any guts, your best will agree to face our best on the fourth week of July.
[236:01.30]Sure.
[236:01.98]We'll take on Hollywood.
[236:04.64]I guess you're not the cowards we thought you were.
[236:06.44]At least you'll put up a fight before you lose.
[236:08.17]I'm gonna fucking injure him before that, by the way.
[236:11.25]Didn't say I couldn't do that.
[236:12.13]You came to a hardcore match.
[236:13.81]This is a hardcore match.
[236:16.99]You'd be lucky if you're fucking still standing by the fourth week of July.
[236:28.68]Give me that chair.
[236:29.12]Give me that chair.
[236:31.20]Give me the chair.
[236:31.62]Give me a weapon.
[236:43.90]Don't let him leave.
[236:44.44]I want him to be at red health.
[236:47.40]Did you just hurt yourself?
[236:48.73]This guy is fucking useless.
[236:58.64]Poor Duke minivan.
[237:00.10]He just doesn't have one to quit.
[237:11.80]I don't care about him anymore.
[237:16.70]I want this guy to have like a back injury.
[237:20.56]Oh shit.
[237:21.14]Alright.
[237:24.76]Okay.
[237:25.36]Okay.
[237:25.99]Alright.
[237:26.59]Whatever.
[237:33.28]No, I challenge all American wrestling to a fight.
[237:43.29]Get the medal.
[237:43.89]Have you ever seen Duke Miniman over there, like, just LARPing as the champion?
[237:55.86]Well, nobody's looking.
[237:57.23]I can be the champion.
[238:10.12]I'm seriously going to fucking put this guy away.
[238:31.17]Duke Miniman.
[238:35.81]Oh no, you got me.
[238:42.84]Thank you.
[238:50.70]Get this guy in the ring.
[239:06.35]Come on.
[239:07.65]He's hurt.
[239:08.81]He's really hurt.
[239:09.53]Okay.
[239:10.81]About that match next week.
[239:17.81]This guy's just crumbling.
[239:36.13]You gotta take on the competition in this game.
[240:01.97]Stay down so the match can end!
[240:33.12]Duke Miniman's just fine.
[240:35.24]Mr. Satan's progress is being hindered by being in an all-American wrestling.
[240:41.04]He's not even injured.
[240:41.60]He's fine.
[240:43.20]He just says, I want to make sure he had zero health for this fight.
[240:49.72]Bird Boy has left Super Lucha Libre.
[240:59.52]The entire sport of wrestling has enjoyed increased popularity.
[241:06.48]This is it right here, right?
[241:07.22]Alright, now we're gonna be a good guy.
[241:19.72]This is Dan Fever.
[241:27.11]People love watching to see Mr. Satan kill people.
[241:30.59]I haven't killed anybody.
[241:43.08]Look, I'm going to be a good guy.
[241:44.96]Putting the mic down, putting the belt down.
[241:47.10]That's it.
[241:47.90]Just a regular singles match.
[241:49.80]Before we go any further, let's take a look at the rules to make sure we're on the same page.
[241:58.49]I'm sorry.
[242:01.89]I'm sorry.
[242:14.18]Okay, wrestling.
[242:19.85]Look, if you give me a playground, I'm going to play, okay?
[242:25.71]If you give me a playground, give me a sandbox, I'm going to make Sandcastle.
[242:30.37]I'm sorry, it's just the way it is.
[242:40.02]See, this is just wrestling.
[242:45.44]wrestling got him just like that spin round again okay a couple of quick punches something around my neck all right let him get a move in because it's exciting
[243:15.32]Okay.
[243:15.68]See, that was his... He did that.
[243:18.67]Right now, we are just playing a wrestling game.
[243:20.25]I'm not trying to do anything weird.
[243:23.11]I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[243:24.13]I'm not going to, like, try to break somebody's leg.
[243:27.83]Just wrestling moves.
[243:29.49]And that's it.
[243:31.67]Otto is displeased by your murder streak.
[243:38.56]I have my ability now.
[243:39.68]Special move.
[243:44.24]All right.
[243:45.44]and that's it it was just a regular wrestling match and I won yeah see I'm we're fine we're a good guy I did get more popular for that he tapped out since he didn't want to die
[244:18.11]Resident sleeper, resident sleeper.
[244:20.59]Look, you can't just go 100 on the gas the whole time.
[244:24.15]You gotta, like, popularity.
[244:26.49]Okay, here comes... May be fortunate enough to have a cushy contract, but not everybody else does.
[244:44.84]Why don't we all unionize until they extend the same rights to everybody on the roster?
[244:57.87]Sure.
[244:59.67]That's the spirit.
[245:00.29]They want us divided, but together we can make a difference.
[245:03.80]But, this is very important, but...
[245:06.57]I may or may not kill some of you uh that's just the way it is steel cage match sure let's like work together but like I'm I you give me a chair and I'm gonna be I'm not gonna hold back that made me more popular it didn't

[246:11.02]Let's go.
[246:14.74]By the way, we decided to unionize.
[246:24.23]Trying to grab him.
[246:29.81]Why is he coming into the cage?
[246:37.78]He shouldn't be in here.
[246:43.03]Why are they both coming in?
[246:47.23]All American Wrestling, please welcome Mr. Satan.
[246:53.22]And referencing Hollywood, Slick Dude.
[246:56.38]I'm Vito Soprano of Maple Leaf Grappling, and I'm here to be an impartial referee.
[247:00.85]Stakes are high, but let's keep this a fair contest to find out which promotion is the best.
[247:08.17]Out?
[247:12.71]Keep this guy in.
[247:16.57]I don't think they can figure out how to get out of here.
[247:22.68]He's trying to figure out how to leave.
[247:24.16]He can't leave.
[247:36.05]Are they going to get thrown out or disqualified?
[247:42.40]What happens here?
[247:53.49]I kind of don't want them to leave.
[247:54.57]Ow!
[248:04.88]So is this escape the ring or are we stuck in here?
[248:12.83]I got him, right?
[248:14.71]Got him right by the neck.
[248:16.13]Oh, that hurts a lot.
[248:17.31]Somebody asked Dermot this and it's really important.
[248:22.77]Do you like antelopes?
[248:25.55]I don't know.
[248:27.01]I don't dislike antelopes.
[248:35.02]Oh my god.
[248:38.12]That's a lot of blood.
[248:57.11]Referee is going to be so focused.
[248:59.65]Oh wait, Vince McMahon is getting out.
[249:03.23]He's going to get out.
[249:03.85]I think he's going to actually leave.
[249:09.61]Shake it on a little.
[249:10.49]Make it a little harder.
[249:11.37]Congrats to the guy spamming that.
[249:22.11]Finally got his attention.
[249:26.04]Did I give in to a spammer?
[249:27.64]Uh-oh.
[249:42.35]So something that I want to do before this stream is over.
[249:48.51]You can make your own match.
[249:51.60]And I kind of want to make my own match with as crazy rules as I can before we stop playing this game.
[250:00.65]I think I have solidified myself as the best wrestler in the world.
[250:03.21]What else do I need?
[250:06.76]Make a landmine match.
[250:25.55]He just fell on me.
[250:26.17]That didn't even count.
[250:34.03]Landmine match.
[250:35.85]Yeah, we'll play around with that for a while.
[250:47.10]So do I actually have to leave?
[250:48.88]I think I have to escape.
[250:57.34]It's a pin?
[251:02.10]Well, there's your pin.
[251:13.29]What's it called?
[251:13.85]You gotta put him in a body bag.
[251:15.37]One.
[251:20.62]Two.
[251:31.14]So it looks like there's no real repercussions for staying in.
[251:35.30]Vince McMahon got out.
[251:38.41]Did he?
[251:40.65]I don't see him anywhere.
[251:41.25]Where'd he go?
[251:41.61]Alright, I have to pin this guy.
[251:58.50]Jesus, oh my god.
[252:00.24]Alright, that's it.
[252:01.53]Pin.

[260:19.08]Uh-oh, people are dropping very quickly.
[260:28.39]You can throw other people out the window?
[260:30.47]No, you can't.
[260:32.01]Don't tell me I can do that.
[260:33.20]It's not possible.
[260:37.38]I can't even see where I am right now.
[260:39.34]Alright, I got somebody.
[260:40.26]Throw him out the window?
[260:41.90]How do I throw... Okay, throw him out the window.
[260:49.68]I don't think so.
[260:53.40]I have to break the window first?
[260:59.35]That's a painting.
[261:13.61]I love the fires.
[261:14.79]I'm just gonna hide in the plant.

[265:25.65]Be careful what you wish for.

[271:47.90]What a fun game.
[271:48.98]Where am I?
[271:52.32]Where's Mr. Satan?
[272:00.07]Oh, it's down here.
[272:00.67]Okay.

[272:05.66]We're going to do large arena.
[272:07.48]Sold out crowd.
[272:09.70]No, the ring is going to be... Our normal ring is fine.
[272:15.50]It can be pretty big.
[272:18.48]We do a cage.
[272:19.14]Okay.
[272:24.71]Okay.
[272:27.51]How about... It's a virtual crowd.

[272:50.42]Because we're gonna do tables.
[272:58.30]Actually, you know what?
[272:58.92]I want 60 tables and like just a few weapons.
[273:06.11]And if you're asking why, it's because I want to see how many tables you can stack.
[273:11.29]I want to see if you can stack like 10 tables, because if you can, I want to stack 10 tables.
[273:24.43]We'll do 40.
[273:26.93]Rules.
[273:30.95]No rules.
[273:31.59]Just a street fight.
[273:33.61]Stoppage is a... Wait, no health.
[273:45.00]Aim is elimination.
[273:45.82]Individual is hardcore.
[273:51.32]Last man... No.
[273:52.90]Street fight's fine.
[273:53.76]Street fight's fine.

[274:16.76]Okay.
[274:17.87]So this is a... When your health gets to zero, you lose.
[274:21.01]Me versus Mr. Satan.
[274:22.11]He's way stronger than me, so this is already not fair.
[274:26.85]Here I go.

[277:04.73]He's cleaning up the ring.
[277:05.89]You're right.
[277:06.35]He's cleaning up.
[277:07.19]I just hit my face.

[278:57.09]He's staying up there.
[279:02.62]No, what am I doing?
[279:03.38]I don't want to climb.
[279:04.06]I wasn't even trying to do that.
[279:10.03]I'm trying to connect them.
[279:12.29]I'm not trying to climb.
[279:13.49]What?
[279:35.59]That was a high dive into the ground.
[279:42.98]It's over, Anakin!
[279:44.96]Somebody just said that.
[279:45.82]That's so funny.
[279:49.88]I want to see if we can stack those two.
[279:54.24]You know what?

[280:59.34]He picked him up.
[281:00.76]He's picking him up.
[281:02.44]I swear to God, there's a Snoopy game where you have to hold pizzas like this.
[281:05.38]They can't even see me.
[281:12.96]He's coming up.
[281:15.08]Oh, my God.

[286:41.83]I need to lose like 5 pounds.
[286:47.61]You look like a guy from LazyTown?
[286:50.21]The guy that does like all the cartwheels?
[286:52.55]I don't even know what the guy's name is.
[286:54.46]What's that guy's name?

[287:48.28]And now he thinks he's like, okay, we're leaving the room now.
[287:52.51]He's like, why did you do all that if we're not going to leave?
[287:59.31]He does sneeze.
[287:59.87]That means he's happy.
[288:02.45]Alright, you ready to go?
[288:03.12]I'm just going to let him out here.
[288:11.02]And let's call it.
[288:14.76]Thank you again, everybody, for watching.
[288:18.84]Is it a beard arc?
[288:20.22]No, no.
[288:23.16]Once it gets to this point, it has to go.
[288:27.53]Another day or two, and this is going to be very scraggly and itchy and annoying.
[288:35.93]I know, I know, he's like looking at me like, what the hell are you doing?
[288:41.02]Yeah, that was Wrestling Empire on Steam.
[288:44.32]I would highly recommend that you go buy that if you thought it was fun.
[288:47.60]Thought it was funny.
[288:50.54]I mean, the game's really fun.
[288:53.48]Just as a video game on its own.
[288:54.96]Forget about all the crazy shit that you can do.
[288:58.00]It's a fun wrestling game, too.
[289:03.78]Alright, come on.
[289:05.02]Come here, come here.
[289:06.06]He just wants to leave the room.
[289:06.86]Do you want us to go out of the room?
[289:07.96]Oh.
[289:12.40]His foot grabbed my mouse cord and he just pulled it down.
[289:19.23]What do you mind?
[289:24.33]What?
[289:25.45]You want to go?
[289:25.79]All right.
[289:26.63]Come here.
[289:27.59]Let's go.
[289:28.33]Let's go.
[289:29.03]Let's go.
[289:29.41]Let's go.
[289:29.75]Let's go.
[289:36.33]He's so excited.
[289:41.50]Yeah, he like ran and my little- my mouse cord was underneath there and he went, just pulled it.
[289:47.04]Then he ran away.
[289:51.74]Are you gonna do VR with STIR?
[289:54.72]Something me and STIR were talking about, we're actually gonna do, but just haven't had to find the time to do it.
[289:59.86]We really want to do the remake the video stream.
[290:04.31]We already talked about it a few times.
[290:05.39]Remember the remake stuff?
[290:11.51]It's gonna happen.
[290:12.31]There's a lot of stuff going on.
[290:14.23]We have to find time to do it.
[290:20.37]We already talked about what it would be and what we would do.
[290:24.01]And it sounds actually really fun.
[290:29.59]But that is going to be the end of this stream.
[290:32.65]And the end of this weekend.
[290:34.93]Thanks for sticking around for the whole weekend.
[290:36.81]Pretty much.
[290:38.03]Saturday and Sunday here.
[290:39.67]We'll see you next weekend everybody.
[290:40.75]Have a great week.
[290:44.57]For VR.
[290:46.83]I don't have a plan on what game.
[290:49.53]It's going to be like all the other VR streams.
[290:51.39]Where I just download like 15 VR games.
[290:54.56]And we just play them for like an hour.
[290:56.28]Two hours.
[290:57.92]We'll see what happens.
[291:01.70]That was a lot of fun.
[291:02.96]Also, thanks Connor for the raid, too.
[291:04.89]Connor dropped a raid.
[291:05.69]It was either a raid or a host, I'm not sure which one.
[291:07.99]But thank you regardless.
[291:10.09]And Animos gave 10 community subs.
[291:12.37]Thank you, Animos.
[291:14.49]Get Rick and Morty VR.
[291:15.61]I did Rick and Morty VR as a joke and everybody freaked out and hated me.
[291:18.17]That was like two or three years ago.
[291:22.59]People were very upset that I played that for like 30 minutes.
[291:32.72]Do it again.
[291:33.36]I'm not going to play it again.
[291:37.09]Get Boneworks?
[291:44.49]Yeah.
[291:44.87]I mean, I'll definitely play Boneworks.
[291:47.73]I want to play some stuff that utilizes those knuckle controllers.
[291:50.12]I heard they're amazing.
[291:56.96]Play it unironically this time.
[291:58.52]Oh.
[292:02.23]Yeah.
[292:03.04]It was a blast.
[292:04.50]What a fun weekend on Wrestling Empire.
[292:08.60]I'll see you guys soon.
[292:09.24]Have a great week.
[292:11.12]Thanks again.
[292:11.50]See you soon.
[292:14.47]Good night.
