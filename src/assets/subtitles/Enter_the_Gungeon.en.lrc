[ve:60.16.100]

[00:12.54]Oh, it's gonna start playing.
[00:16.84]Make sure you buy the queso lupa.
[00:21.43]That's what this ad just told me.
[00:26.97]Is this a little loud?
[00:27.71]I feel like it's loud.
[00:29.33]I'm gonna do this.
[00:39.74]And then I'm going to drop it in the mixer.
[00:43.30]One second.
[00:53.07]Maybe that'll help.
[00:57.43]Yeah, I apologize.
[00:58.61]I'm a little bit under the weather.
[01:00.59]I just got back from a trip to Florida.
[01:05.01]And you know the deal, guys.
[01:06.55]Every single time you go on vacation, you have to get sick.
[01:10.33]Every time.
[01:12.25]Happens to me.
[01:12.95]Every single time I have ever taken a plane.
[01:16.05]It doesn't matter if I... I could get inside of a plane and just stand in it for 10 seconds.
[01:21.65]And I would come out sick.
[01:23.55]I don't know what it is.
[01:24.55]But it's really, really annoying.
[01:29.51]Yes, there are new emotes.
[01:36.60]So, I have no idea how to play this game.
[01:40.62]All I know is that it exists.
[01:42.14]It's like a roguelike Binding of Isaac nuclear throne kind of mishmash.
[01:49.47]Okay, we can be the convict, the pilot, the marine, the hunter, or I want to be the Jawa.
[01:57.65]Why can't I be the Jawa?
[02:00.20]Why can't I be the Jawa?
[02:06.65]I'm going to be the pilot.
[02:08.97]Why not?
[02:14.60]Who just resubscribed?
[02:16.40]Renix.
[02:17.64]Two months in a row.
[02:19.30]Welcome.
[02:19.74]Welcome back.
[02:23.88]I can buy things here?
[02:24.87]Is that how it works?
[02:25.57]Inventory.
[02:26.09]I can look in the inventory.
[02:26.89]Okay.
[02:29.47]Okay.
[02:36.30]Oh, the Jabba has co-op only.
[02:37.52]Oh, whatever.
[02:41.54]So, this is my inventory.
[02:42.89]I can look at bosses.
[02:44.53]We're just going to go.
[02:45.09]I don't really... I don't think I've unlocked anything because I literally just turned the game on.
[02:56.29]I'm just going to go.
[02:58.42]Right?
[02:59.82]I thought that was in the game.
[03:02.80]I legit thought that was in the game.
[03:07.90]Sab3600.
[03:09.80]Welcome, Sab.
[03:10.42]Thanks for something.
[03:11.69]Welcome to the family.
[03:13.27]New emotes.
[03:15.15]I can't go in here?
[03:16.65]What the hell?
[03:18.67]There are three new emotes.
[03:20.23]There's Jerma Jupiter.
[03:21.31]There is what's supposed to be Jerma Uranus, but it just turned into a blue egg.
[03:25.36]And there's Glue Man.
[03:26.74]So you have some new emotes to play around with.
[03:32.08]I can't go in the pizza room yet.
[03:34.92]I have to level up my dominoes ability.
[03:42.38]The cultist, that's what it is.
[03:44.40]Ah, the French champagne.
[03:47.85]Okay.
[03:48.11]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:51.61]Firefox turtle.
[03:52.91]Welcome back, thanks for subbing.
[03:55.25]I just want to play.
[04:03.52]You can destroy the books.
[04:06.30]Oh wow, this is destructible environments.
[04:08.48]Game of the fucking century.
[04:13.35]I don't seem to have a weapon.
[04:15.62]Wayward soul, approach me and press E to speak.
[04:18.46]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for sex.
[04:25.83]Minulinks, welcome back.
[04:27.25]Probably going to be quite a few of these in the beginning here.
[04:30.60]I told you!
[04:35.46]That was delicious.
[04:39.37]Welcome back.
[04:41.59]Heed my words and I shall show you how to survive this accursed labyrinth.
[04:46.70]Continue to the door to begin your tutelage.
[04:52.11]Do you have another question, pupil?
[04:53.73]When do I get a gun?
[04:55.61]So very soon.
[04:56.66]Proceed to the door.
[04:57.42]I get it when I break some shit.
[04:59.36]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[05:05.55]Darth Buttcrust with four months.
[05:09.63]Master of the Buttcrust.
[05:12.84]Flip the tables with E. Okay, you can table flip in this game?
[05:16.70]That's so awesome.
[05:19.64]I love his face when you do it, too.
[05:21.02]He has this extremely angry face.
[05:23.06]God damn it.
[05:24.18]Oh, I thought that was going to explode.
[05:30.62]Come on!
[05:33.06]Why explode?
[05:35.18]Will you fucking blow up?
[05:37.17]Fine.
[05:41.21]Anything that outlines in white when you approach can be interacted with.
[05:46.85]Cool.
[05:52.42]This is the most important lesson.
[05:53.50]You can dodge roll by pressing right click in a direction.
[05:56.02]That's cool.
[05:58.30]You are invulnerable to gunfire during the first half of the dodge roll, but vulnerable again when you hit the ground.
[06:04.21]This means you can dodge through bullets and other hazards.
[06:06.57]It requires precise timing.
[06:08.05]When you give the word, I'll open the barrier, use the dodge roll to reach the right side of the room without perishing.
[06:14.37]Wait until the last second.
[06:16.93]And press right click.
[06:18.05]Alright, alright.
[06:18.71]Let's go.
[06:21.44]So it works like pretty much anything else.
[06:22.98]You just have to... It's when you touch the ground is when you can get hit again.
[06:29.10]Okay.
[06:31.53]I did it.
[06:34.57]Dodge Roll is the prayer of the Gungeoneer, and the Gungeon provides for its devotees.
[06:39.81]No one knows why this only works in the Gungeon, only that the Gungeon provides.
[06:45.96]Whatever.
[06:46.50]Less talky, more playy.
[06:49.24]Use your Dodge Roll to jump over the impasse.
[06:50.56]You got it.
[06:53.02]You got it.
[06:54.28]Got it.
[06:54.50]Hey, don't worry.
[06:55.90]You got it.
[06:57.24]The door is open, but you've got one last pit to cross.
[06:59.60]Time it well.
[07:00.22]I already did it.
[07:03.40]Did you not see me just do that?
[07:04.48]Now what?
[07:09.13]Dodge roll is the first and best way to avoid dying in a gunfight.
[07:12.41]Sometimes, though, the number of bullets can be overwhelming.
[07:14.85]For instance, there's no dodging through that, but there is a way to clear the path.
[07:19.75]These are called blanks.
[07:21.93]Using one will delete all enemy projectiles in a room and stop enemies from shooting for a period.
[07:27.95]So they kind of freeze time.
[07:30.87]You'll also push nearby enemies away.
[07:32.27]Okay, pick them up, I'm walking over there.
[07:36.90]And use it by pressing Q. Okay.
[07:45.53]Very cool.
[07:46.23]Very cool.
[07:48.84]Excellent.
[07:55.06]Whoa!
[07:55.52]A Twitch with me in it.
[07:57.02]Welcome.
[07:57.38]Thank you.
[07:58.67]Enjoy Jarba Jupiter.
[08:01.67]Yeah, but I'll go over the emotes just for a second here.
[08:05.92]I'm seeing a lot of people put the egg down.
[08:08.54]That is supposed to be Uranus, but I fucking ran out of ideas.
[08:12.78]I tried Uranus.
[08:13.94]I tried so many things.
[08:16.08]This is nothing worked.
[08:17.22]I wasn't happy with any of it.
[08:19.34]So that's just the Uranus egg.
[08:23.16]That's Uranus.
[08:25.59]And it's staying that way.
[08:28.59]I've had at least two people tell me that, like, please delete that emote because it sucks so bad.
[08:35.65]And I'm like, well, that's why it's staying.
[08:39.23]They can be also found throughout the Gungeon.
[08:40.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:42.27]So you get two.
[08:43.73]I'm assuming.
[08:45.31]Also, I apologize.
[08:46.13]I'm fairly ill at the moment.
[08:49.05]I'm fairly ill.
[08:51.42]So if I, like, lose my place or stumble around or not good at the game or, you know, say something dumb, it's because I'm sick, guys.
[09:00.22]You know?
[09:01.36]You got the basic scoundrel.
[09:02.68]I suppose you've earned a reward.
[09:03.84]A gun befitting your stature and experience.
[09:06.86]Ooh, open the treasure chest.
[09:09.93]It's a sweet PE gun.
[09:13.72]Use the mouse to aim and left click to fire.
[09:15.26]Oh, it is a PE gun.
[09:19.58]I need something to shoot.
[09:22.28]Uh-oh, it's Bullet Bill.
[09:26.51]He's here for revenge.
[09:33.55]Oh, this is fun.
[09:35.29]I think I'm gonna really like this game.
[09:38.50]Cold-blooded, truly, you are ruthless.
[09:41.48]Next rooms will be real gunfights.
[09:42.62]Kill all the enemies in each room and the doors will all open.
[09:45.02]I'll meet you in a few rooms ahead and I'll go.
[09:46.54]Let me make sure that this is... the sensitivity I want.
[09:52.24]I could probably drop it a little bit.
[09:59.86]Uh... Can I drop it?
[10:02.03]Screen, shake him out, get that out of here.
[10:06.93]Um...
[10:08.91]Control or aim lock, control or aim assist.
[10:13.25]Controls?
[10:18.81]I don't know.
[10:35.62]Maybe it's just tied directly to mouse input?
[10:43.08]It's actually not that bad.
[10:45.52]It's not terrible.
[10:50.01]Alright, let's kill some enemies.
[10:58.42]Okay, so it's in the direction you're... So you can't, like... It's not...
[11:02.68]Alright, because that was confusing me.
[11:04.60]So I can dodge roll.
[11:05.92]It's whatever direction you're currently pushing.
[11:08.20]For some reason, I thought it was where the mouse was moving.
[11:10.81]But no, it's wherever you're moving on WASD is where the dodge roll will happen.
[11:16.43]I might actually change that to something else besides right-click.
[11:24.89]The sun is smaller than Jupiter.
[11:26.55]This is unacceptable.
[11:27.99]The sun should fill the whole chat.
[11:30.63]Well, Jupiter is supposed to be huge.
[11:32.63]And we're talking about in the grand scheme of things.
[11:36.63]Jupiter is... If you look at your science textbooks, Jupiter is gigantic.
[11:44.06]Dude, that's four emotes that I've wasted.
[11:49.42]I'm out of emotes now because I made Jupiter.
[11:54.87]So ammo's on the right.
[12:00.25]Are these coins or something?
[12:03.79]I love how people are trying to connect them.
[12:05.75]Look at Stormflare and Buttcrust.
[12:19.77]They just accidentally did that.
[12:25.86]Ah, the record keeper.
[12:27.46]Welcome back, record keeper.
[12:30.06]He's writing down, jotting down all these things to happen in this stream.
[12:33.50]Thank you.
[12:35.28]So you get med kits.
[12:37.40]Pick up a project and hit E. You still have a bit of fight in you, so you might want to wait to use it.
[12:46.22]Space button uses items.
[12:48.02]Okay.
[12:49.68]I am going to make... Hmm.
[12:52.68]What is it like if... What's the controller like in this game?
[12:55.32]Oh.
[12:55.62]Okay.
[12:58.64]Okay.
[12:58.90]Hold on.
[12:59.24]What the fuck?
[13:01.98]Okay.
[13:02.40]Let me... Okay.
[13:04.40]I've lost all control.
[13:10.58]Shit, I just hit right trigger.
[13:12.00]I don't know what that did.
[13:13.52]I'm trying to figure out like if the controller is better or not.
[13:21.95]I don't think so.
[13:22.55]The controller actually feels a little awkward.
[13:28.95]Listen to me, son.
[13:31.51]I'm your dad.
[13:33.93]Destroy him!
[13:36.60]That one guy.
[13:40.09]That 831st guy just subscribed.
[13:42.21]Welcome.
[13:43.85]Thank you.
[13:48.09]What does this do?
[13:48.57]Got it?
[13:50.19]I got it.
[13:50.43]So that's really cool.
[14:06.63]Because one of the things about Isaac, which this game, I guess, takes a lot of influence from, is the fact that you can't really drink French champagne.
[14:18.18]Mr. Sandman, welcome.
[14:19.10]Welcome back.
[14:21.36]Thanks a lot, dude.
[14:21.94]Appreciate it.
[14:25.06]You can warp to any teleporter on the map.
[14:27.02]Not just ones in the same room, but they won't work if you're in combat.
[14:31.65]Fast travel.
[14:32.27]I love fast travel in games.
[14:33.97]It just cuts out the middleman.
[14:37.74]Use the telephone back to where you were.
[14:39.22]I'll be waiting a few rooms north of here.
[14:40.46]You should explore.
[14:41.06]Try to find a better gun before you challenge the boss.
[14:44.66]Okay.
[14:58.08]Benji... Benji Menji.
[15:01.55]Just subscribe.
[15:02.21]Welcome.
[15:04.55]Thanks, Benji Menji.
[15:15.51]I do like the... It feels very satisfying to shoot guns.
[15:22.27]That is my teleporter.
[15:23.83]Let's do some exploring.
[15:35.38]Ooh!
[15:36.58]Rootin' tootin' cowboy!
[15:37.64]Listen to me, son!
[15:40.32]I'm your dad!
[15:42.72]Destroy!
[15:42.98]Destroy!
[15:45.79]Adam Clark.
[15:48.61]AdamClark41.
[15:50.39]First and last name.
[15:51.89]Just subscribed.
[15:52.65]Welcome.
[15:52.95]Thanks, dude.
[15:53.29]If you have two or more guns, hold control to slow time and pick the one you want.
[16:01.12]Alrighty.
[16:02.24]I don't think I have more than one right now.
[16:05.42]Control to switch guns.
[16:07.28]Well, this is... I'm assuming a gun is in here.
[16:09.02]AK-47.
[16:09.12]AK-47.
[16:09.28]Accept no substitutes.
[16:16.95]So do I have like a meter that I'm using or is it just slow time forever?
[16:22.64]How does this work?
[16:26.26]Ah, the French champagne.
[16:28.98]Oh, that's cool.
[16:29.98]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[16:33.39]Radio Vidya.
[16:35.45]The two months.
[16:37.53]Welcome back.
[16:39.11]You know what I need to get for resubs that are more than like two or three months?
[16:43.91]Is the Welcome Back Red Wizard from Gauntlet Legends.
[16:49.25]I'm gonna find that wherever I can somewhere.
[16:51.15]I don't think I even want to use this.
[16:54.79]I'm gonna test it.
[16:57.79]Did I get hit?
[17:01.76]No, I didn't.
[17:04.30]Okay, these books are freaking me out.
[17:05.36]I think the books are projectiles.
[17:09.16]So do you have... I just want to see.
[17:14.27]Okay, you do not have unlimited ammo on any weapon.
[17:17.07]I just wanted to confirm that.
[17:21.45]Nothing seems to be... Are there secret rooms in this game?
[17:23.53]Like, what is this?
[17:25.17]That looks like a secret room.
[17:27.84]Do I have a bomb or anything that I can blow the door with?
[17:29.96]I don't know.
[17:38.09]My brain is telling me that I can go in there.
[17:40.59]But I don't know.
[17:41.59]I have no idea.
[17:46.96]Oh, well.
[17:47.46]Let's go.
[17:49.42]Yeah, there is.
[17:50.08]Yeah.
[17:50.48]I just don't have one.
[17:55.28]Do the blanks... Blanks will blow it up?
[17:57.33]I thought blanks just kind of froze time and removed projectiles.
[18:00.67]Alright.
[18:02.77]Well, those work too.
[18:03.73]Okay.
[18:05.12]Hey, you learn something, never die.
[18:06.22]You learn something, never die.
[18:07.38]Another nephron.
[18:15.69]Welcome.
[18:16.53]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[18:17.69]Thank you.
[18:18.83]I'm assuming those are like spirit hearts.
[18:24.49]Or do I have to actually put it on?
[18:28.60]Old Knight's shield has joined the shootout.
[18:33.58]Old Knight's Helm has joined the shootout.
[18:35.31]This one we'll take a look.
[18:41.93]Guns, active passive items.
[18:45.07]The shield of Sir Manuel imbazzled with his house signal a couple of knowledge.
[18:47.81]There's a diagram on the book.
[18:49.85]Passive.
[18:52.29]Strap on the shield.
[18:56.60]Does it say any like where?
[18:58.06]I'm just curious.
[18:59.74]I wanted to see.
[19:02.04]If it says it anywhere.
[19:03.30]Can I, like, turn the page?
[19:09.17]Whatever.
[19:10.15]I mean, I don't know.
[19:11.35]I think those are just hearts.
[19:13.35]They are in place.
[19:18.46]Keep going.
[19:19.20]I think I've explored everything.
[19:20.02]I think it's time to fight the big meanie behind the door.
[19:25.67]Had to pay the boss to rob him.
[19:32.39]Super Saiyan spud?
[19:35.29]Welcome, dude.
[19:36.89]I'm ready for the final test.
[19:38.05]Let's go.
[19:38.67]Uh-oh.
[19:41.05]He's the bad guy.
[19:41.89]Oh, I'm getting stuck in the door.
[19:57.81]Is there a finite amount of time you can do that dodge roll before you can't do it anymore?
[20:04.75]Like, does it have a stamina meter or something like that?
[20:06.60]Or can I just do this forever?
[20:09.50]Looks like I can just do it forever.
[20:13.64]Wait, that shield... You found my shield, which means you know my terrible secret.
[20:17.87]Uh-oh.
[20:20.75]He never conquered the Gungeon.
[20:24.13]Yeah, I suspected as much.
[20:25.27]Fuck you.
[20:27.66]Nothing left to teach you, steady aim, pilot.
[20:30.97]Hey, thanks.
[20:34.05]You're only invulnerable 50% of the time?
[20:36.55]Yeah, I know, like, when you hit the ground is when it's over, but... I just didn't know if there was, like, a Dark Souls stamina bar or something.
[20:42.83]Oh, that kind of scared me.
[20:45.98]Ugh, I think I'm gonna puke.
[20:54.32]If the stream ends abruptly, it means I have to go puke and leave.
[20:59.25]So, sorry.
[21:01.95]What do we have here?
[21:02.47]You must be the new arrival.
[21:04.95]Listen to me, son.
[21:05.81]Here to change the past.
[21:08.47]Destroy him!
[21:11.91]Whoa!
[21:13.11]What's going on, zombie man?
[21:15.08]Welcome.
[21:16.78]Enjoy your stay.
[21:17.64]Enjoy Jupiter.
[21:21.14]There's no salvation here.
[21:22.18]I was like, you once came to change the past and now I have no future.
[21:25.14]And he's just drinking.
[21:27.94]He's just slamming bottles over here.
[21:32.08]I just did you a favor.
[21:34.20]Is that all this guy does?
[21:34.96]He's got a spirit.
[21:38.10]He's stuck in those halls.
[21:39.52]Lost.
[21:39.96]Sad, really.
[21:44.45]I can switch characters.
[21:45.45]But I'm going to stay on this guy for now.
[21:52.79]I'm fucking Matt Damon.
[21:56.27]All one word.
[21:57.28]I'm fucking Matt Damon.
[21:58.82]Just subscribe.
[21:59.70]What?
[21:59.92]I didn't think you could die in the hub area.
[22:11.47]Can't go this way.
[22:12.27]Did that open up the main game?
[22:14.77]Is that what happened here?
[22:18.27]I believe that's what happened here.
[22:19.49]Are you kidding me?
[22:21.93]You're now ready to enter the Gungeon.
[22:24.89]Thanks, guys.
[22:27.27]Oh, look at them.
[22:30.51]Oh, look at you guys.
[22:31.35]Alright.
[22:39.13]Keep of the Lead Lord.
[22:40.79]Chamber number one.
[22:43.83]And so it begins.
[22:47.48]And so it begins.
[22:48.82]Where are my glasses?
[22:51.12]I got, like, glasses now, guys.
[22:59.41]Mom will be proud that you just resubbed.
[23:02.73]Thanks a lot, dude.
[23:04.71]Erzberg.
[23:14.28]Erzber, thanks for something.
[23:16.10]Welcome.
[23:17.46]Welcome to the Gungeon.
[23:19.64]Much appreciated, dude.
[23:21.90]So should I just be kind of playing this game like I would play Isaac?
[23:25.07]And look around for secrets?
[23:26.47]Is there any doors that need to be broken open?
[23:28.23]Can I get in somewhere?
[23:29.51]Can I do anything?
[23:37.64]I like these, like, Wizard of Oz top hat people, though.
[23:39.80]They're kind of funny looking.
[23:52.26]Seems to be more like Nuclear Throne.
[23:53.52]Yeah, it does have a Nuclear Throne feel to it.
[24:00.35]Welcome back, Blood Baron.
[24:03.19]Ooh, I got hit.
[24:07.75]Welcome back, the Baron of Blood.
[24:21.31]I like this.
[24:22.54]I like this.
[24:23.44]This game's fun.
[24:25.06]Oh, that's awesome!
[24:26.18]You can use this as an action movie shield.
[24:30.76]Get down!
[24:31.74]That's awesome.
[24:33.00]I'm gonna go... I'll go this way first.
[24:39.69]Whoa.
[24:42.01]Big fat guy with a sword.
[24:43.13]Doesn't mess around.
[24:57.63]What the hell?
[25:03.51]Die.
[25:03.95]Finally.
[25:05.63]And Mr. Monkey Man with a resub.
[25:07.50]Welcome back, monkey.
[25:09.84]Monkeys.
[25:10.96]Oh, shit.
[25:12.48]I feel like I shouldn't be touching that on the ground.
[25:21.00]Ooh.
[25:22.76]Okay.
[25:22.96]That was an enemy I've never seen before.
[25:24.70]Keep going down.
[25:26.40]Ugh.
[25:29.58]I apologize for the nose noises.
[25:31.44]They're gonna start happening more frequently.
[25:33.48]I can feel it.
[25:34.02]This guy's kind of easy once you figure out what the hell he does.
[25:46.61]Ooh.
[25:46.69]Whoa.
[25:51.92]Okay, that was like a kamikaze bird.
[25:53.82]Let's go this way.
[25:59.42]It's a new gun.
[26:06.38]Wind-up gun.
[26:09.62]Charge it.
[26:11.36]What does that mean?
[26:16.71]It plays a little song.
[26:17.73]Okay, let's try it.
[26:30.81]Jesus!
[26:37.43]He's got a lot of ammo too.
[26:41.89]The future Ramagun.
[26:43.25]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[26:49.72]Ah, the French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[26:57.39]Ronnie Gizzo.
[27:01.01]Ronnie Gizzo.
[27:03.71]Thanks, welcome back.
[27:11.28]Is that his headbutt, that guy?
[27:12.86]I don't know.
[27:13.24]He just kinda walked into me.
[27:21.47]I hate these things.
[27:22.15]I hate that they split.
[27:35.00]Die!
[27:37.74]Okay.
[27:41.46]I like the, uh, the Jerma-Jupiter slideshow that that person just put on.
[27:48.23]I have a limit of, like, 12 emotes, by the way.
[27:51.65]I think that was specifically intended to make sure people couldn't just do a full chat of Jupiter.
[27:57.49]Uh, that's the boss.
[28:04.86]Oh, you didn't think I knew how to do that one?
[28:07.94]You didn't think I was good enough to do the push-shoot?
[28:13.26]You were wrong.
[28:31.41]Joshua.
[28:32.71]Welcome back, dude.
[28:33.27]Thanks.
[28:37.67]How are you?
[28:40.85]Welcome back.
[28:43.43]Welcome back.
[28:44.95]What does that mean?
[28:46.12]What does that term mean, right?
[28:47.74]Like, welcome back.
[28:51.68]I mean, he didn't go anywhere.
[28:53.27]I don't know why I say welcome back.
[28:58.55]I think it's just like something people... Was it a new key?
[29:04.55]Huh.
[29:06.67]Do I have like a... Okay.
[29:09.73]Alright.
[29:11.33]I just hit space.
[29:13.46]Jar of Bees.
[29:16.77]What the hell does that do?
[29:19.65]Peashooter.
[29:21.27]Jar of bees.
[29:23.03]Who needs keys?
[29:23.75]Okay.
[29:24.43]These bees have been carefully trained to hunt down enemy munitions and destroy them.
[29:31.67]Okie dokie.
[29:34.65]Okie dokie.
[29:37.00]Wait, that's an active, isn't it?
[29:39.04]Hold on.
[29:40.58]Let me get this straight.
[29:42.18]Active items.
[29:42.78]So how do I switch between my actives?
[29:47.08]Is there like a certain button I need to press?
[29:48.42]Interact, reload, move up.
[29:53.62]Use blank.
[29:55.26]Next gun.
[29:56.16]Next item.
[29:56.74]Left shift.
[29:57.40]Okay.
[30:00.97]So, here's the jar of bees.
[30:04.13]Cool.
[30:05.51]Very cool.
[30:06.43]Let's go back up here.
[30:08.07]Did it say there was a key in here?
[30:13.82]Oh, there we go.
[30:15.38]There's a key in here.
[30:17.76]The Avenger of Faith.
[30:27.65]The Faith Avenger.
[30:29.31]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[30:30.49]Welcome.
[30:33.81]Welcome, Faith Avenger.
[30:35.12]Uh...
[30:41.07]I'm not really sure what this is all for, but... This room can't be completely useless, can it?
[30:47.35]Or is it?
[30:50.79]Maybe it is.
[30:52.03]Or maybe there's something specific I have to do that I don't know.
[31:00.67]Uh, is that it?
[31:01.24]I can go down here.
[31:04.63]There's like a mini-boss or something down there.
[31:06.07]I don't know what it is.
[31:07.73]I wish I could mute my microphone right now because I so desperately need to blow my nose.
[31:12.96]I'm gonna have to, like, take a break and just go blow my nose into my toilet.
[31:16.78]Oh, it's a shop.
[31:17.46]Okay.
[31:18.04]That's what the shop looks like.
[31:19.02]There's a guy with a big mustache.
[31:21.48]Um... Just pee the fire out.
[31:26.90]Watch out for all the bullets.
[31:31.67]Use the teleporter to come back and spend more.
[31:34.05]So what is qualified as money?
[31:35.95]It's the bullets.
[31:38.14]Ammo.
[31:39.96]Key.
[31:42.30]This bag of corn.
[31:43.74]Backpack.
[31:50.42]Shoot him.
[31:54.17]He doesn't do anything.
[31:55.11]He just says, No firing the shop!
[31:57.87]Oh, fuck.
[31:59.83]Item capacity up.
[32:02.81]Kind of didn't want to do that.
[32:06.28]Map, 30.
[32:08.82]Blanks.
[32:09.34]Alright, I'm trying to figure this all out.
[32:13.38]Whoa!
[32:13.74]He's got a gun!
[32:16.40]He's got like a shotgun.
[32:20.56]Okay.
[32:21.40]Okay.
[32:22.08]Okay, I'm sorry.
[32:23.19]I didn't mean to do it.
[32:27.11]Oh my god, I'm out of health.
[32:34.38]I'm going to die now.
[32:35.92]Great.
[32:37.68]I can't get hit by the boss in one time.
[32:48.21]You can just rob the shop?
[32:52.27]Drop the gun.
[32:54.59]That drop the gun is great.
[32:58.29]He may have overreacted a little bit.
[32:59.77]Yeah, I think so.
[33:02.25]I shot him with like the giggle gun And he took out his shotgun went crazy Alright.
[33:08.42]Well, I might just die here because I don't know.
[33:10.50]Let's see.
[33:11.56]This is the first time I've ever seen this Alright, jacked bird
[33:30.92]Gatling?
[33:31.40]Alright, whatever.
[33:32.22]You're just dead.
[33:33.46]I'll get him, my bees.
[33:42.81]Yeah, I like the telegraph.
[33:44.85]It helps.
[33:51.06]It's too bad I can only get touched, like, half of one hit.
[33:53.78]Yeah, I'm dead.
[33:57.94]Would have been nice to know that the guy in the shop was going to literally drop a nuclear bomb on his own shop Hey did somebody shoot me with a gun might as well nuke my own shop Whatever Nice catch
[34:27.45]Okey-dokey, let's do it.
[34:29.65]This time, don't take away all of my health, guy in shop.
[34:37.27]Lucratius.
[34:38.05]Welcome, thanks.
[34:47.01]Now I understand.
[34:48.22]I'm starting to get it.
[34:48.82]This is a locked door of some sort?
[34:52.96]What do I think of Gungeon?
[34:54.10]I literally just installed it and turned the stream on.
[34:58.08]So, I'm going to reserve any judgments or anything I have to say for probably like an hour or so.
[35:03.32]Seems like it's a very fun game.
[35:11.93]I'm assuming your name is Assertive?
[35:13.87]A-certive.
[35:15.31]Like A. I get it.
[35:16.91]A-certive.
[35:17.31]Thanks.
[35:17.53]Welcome back.
[35:18.23]Welcome back.
[35:19.49]Even though you never left.
[35:38.15]I'll get by that.
[35:39.98]These guys remind me of something I just don't know what.
[35:45.04]What do those gumdrop Wizard of Oz people remind me of?
[35:49.79]I've got to wish I knew what it was.
[35:51.43]It's a very large room.
[36:04.98]To be Jupiter's.
[36:07.36]No, not a shotgun shell.
[36:08.32]It's something very specific.
[36:14.85]It's extremely specific, whatever it is.
[36:16.77]This guy's new.
[36:20.89]Layman69, welcome.
[36:22.76]Thanks.
[36:23.22]Thanks, thanks, thanks.
[36:34.10]What have you got to say about that?
[36:35.25]Thanks!
[36:37.07]I appreciate it.
[36:39.47]Welcome to the shit-eaters.
[36:45.01]They're annoying.
[36:50.75]And you make sheep noises when you die.
[36:55.92]They're not good.
[36:56.34]I'm gonna have to make some kind of defensive structure here.
[37:04.05]Action movie.
[37:04.49]This is like Lethal Weapon.
[37:05.59]That guy kind of looks like Mel Gibson.
[37:15.18]In that movie.
[37:16.26]He kind of does.
[37:16.78]Except for the little shrimp hair he has in the front.
[37:22.49]Down.
[37:25.47]What is the sub sound?
[37:26.17]It is Paul Bearer from WWF.
[37:30.35]Circa 1998, probably?
[37:33.05]Maybe something like that.
[37:34.17]Is this a glove?
[37:44.46]Look around, look around.
[37:46.04]I still need to utilize my Q. Anytime a game gives me a small number of active items to use, I'm always terrified to use them, and I never use them because I don't want to use them in the wrong spot.
[38:00.57]And it gets me killed.
[38:07.35]Shit.
[38:07.81]I should've just dodged.
[38:08.71]I was going into, like, a dive.
[38:18.86]My left hand is kind of locking up here.
[38:20.58]I think it's because I'm sick.
[38:23.54]And I, like, my whole... Both my hands are ice cubes right now.
[38:30.17]I'm gonna go, like, turn the stove on.
[38:32.23]And put my hand on it.
[38:33.19]Uh, what do I just do?
[38:36.19]Drop the chandeliers?
[38:38.37]Not that hot.
[38:39.57]I'm gonna go get a frying pan.
[38:41.43]Put it to, like, low.
[38:43.16]And then just place my hand in the frying pan for five seconds.
[38:46.44]It's not gonna be too hot.
[38:52.46]Okay.
[38:55.16]I hope there's nothing in this room-
[39:00.80]ice.
[39:02.04]My fingers are stone right now.
[39:07.67]I guess that's everything in there.
[39:10.09]Please refrain from cooking your hands.
[39:13.90]Oh, there's a big chest!
[39:15.92]Nice!
[39:16.64]It's the Toy Story alien gun.
[39:21.78]Oh, it bounces around, too.
[39:24.01]I want to look at it.
[39:28.36]mostly confirming the functionality of bounce physics work was done to improve the design smaller lighter and an attractive shade of purple the rubidine mk the second delivers on the promise of the original prototype oh semi-automatic oh god damn it
[39:52.14]I told you, my fingers are stone right now.
[39:54.28]I tried to hit W and my fingers locked up and I hit Q again.
[39:57.85]I just hit Q again.
[40:02.67]Literally, I'm turning to stone as we speak, guys.
[40:06.39]Halfway through this stream, I'm going to stop talking because my mouth is going to close.
[40:09.92]This is actually kind of a cool gun.
[40:15.58]I don't think I have enough money.
[40:23.12]Uh, hey, should I buy a blank?
[40:24.78]Yeah, sure.
[40:25.32]Uh, mega dowser.
[40:35.25]This is actually really fucking annoying.
[40:36.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[40:39.95]I was just breaking the boxes.
[40:41.45]I was just breaking the boxes.
[40:42.57]Chill out, dude.
[40:44.77]I wasn't trying to hurt you.
[40:45.71]I was just trying to hit you with boxes.
[40:46.85]Let's walk.
[40:57.26]Take it and run.
[40:58.18]No, I'm not risking that.
[40:59.40]I want to beat the first little level here.
[41:01.12]There's the boss.
[41:07.21]There's one more area I haven't gone to.
[41:26.48]Oh.
[41:27.16]Oh, it's criminal.
[41:28.46]You're in deep shit.
[41:32.52]Ooh.
[41:36.81]I have a lockpick.
[41:39.77]Huh?
[41:42.63]Wait, this can't be picked or something?
[41:43.95]I don't get it.
[41:49.02]Do I need another key?
[41:49.86]I don't understand.
[41:58.72]Okay.
[42:05.41]Broke the... Oh, okay.
[42:06.93]Whoa, wait a minute.
[42:07.63]I just shot the hell out of it.
[42:09.49]I got a bag of lunch.
[42:11.49]Next time you use a key.
[42:14.95]Are you serious?
[42:17.98]You just gave me junk?
[42:21.40]Oh, so you can fail to pick locks.
[42:23.04]That's kind of cool.
[42:24.70]Alright, I'm gonna go beat the boss.
[42:35.37]Alright, let's do it.
[42:36.59]Let's go beat the crow.
[42:37.47]Like, if I shook somebody's hand right now, they would go and pull away because my hands are that cold.
[42:48.93]If I grabbed you on the arms, I would leave frostbite on your arm.
[42:52.23]Like Mr. Freeze.
[42:53.31]Alright, let's go.
[43:07.17]Wow!
[43:13.32]I do have my Q.
[43:27.70]Andrel's a dungeon!
[43:30.68]You sorry sack of shit!
[43:36.73]Alright, note to self.
[43:37.71]Do not dodge into him.
[43:39.87]Dodge away from him.
[43:40.67]You know?
[43:42.67]You don't want to get yourself killed.
[43:52.98]Ooh, that hurt.
[43:54.92]He's dead.
[43:57.54]That's not Mr. Freeze's powers.
[44:00.12]Well, it could be.
[44:02.30]Credits.
[44:03.34]Whoa, easy.
[44:05.54]Holy shit, that's crazy.
[44:08.34]Give me some.
[44:10.86]That was a good feast, boys.
[44:16.53]Okie dokie.
[44:19.27]I'm assuming I get to take this.
[44:22.53]Ice cube.
[44:23.05]Items recharge while active.
[44:27.21]And I guess I just get a few things, huh?
[44:34.90]Alright, I beat the game.
[44:36.68]Thanks for watching, guys.
[44:38.24]Thanks for watching Enter the Gungeon.
[44:41.70]I just completed the whole game.
[44:45.56]Order of Dagon, or Dagon.
[44:47.92]The Order of Dagon.
[44:49.18]Welcome back.
[44:52.56]Yeah, that's kind of ironic.
[44:53.56]I got the ice cube.
[44:57.01]Game trying to tell me something.
[44:58.11]Am I being trolled right now?
[45:04.02]Okay, I want to take a look at some things here real quick.
[45:12.61]So active items begin their cooldown period sooner and cooldown faster.
[45:15.81]The junk doesn't do anything.
[45:17.31]Can I only have a certain amount of items?
[45:22.74]Like, is this actually going to cause a problem eventually when I fill this up?
[45:25.93]Or can you not have... Do you get an unlimited amount of passes?
[45:32.07]I don't know.
[45:34.01]I don't know.
[45:35.45]Um... Did I hit Q?
[45:48.53]Yeah.
[45:51.12]Or... I still have two.
[45:53.04]Did that actually happen?
[45:56.20]Alright, don't shoot the gun.
[45:57.63]RubyPlayer36.
[46:00.87]I wish you could see what they do.
[46:05.31]Half-heart.
[46:08.05]Can you just steal and run?
[46:09.35]That was a good Q at least, yeah.
[46:14.83]Kind of.
[46:15.07]Oh, what is that guy?
[46:17.58]What the hell?
[46:20.43]Something for the collection, I will compensate you.
[46:22.37]Is that salad fingers?
[46:27.35]How do I give him something?
[46:35.57]Something for the collection, I will compensate you.
[46:37.66]I want to give him the trash.
[46:42.72]That's a passive.
[46:46.76]I haven't figured that out yet.
[46:51.23]Uh, let's just go.
[46:53.01]I'll come back if I need to.
[47:02.28]Yellow?
[47:02.64]No, I'm gonna use the... I'm gonna use the little baby gun for a little bit.
[47:15.65]I'm gonna change, you know what's gonna happen here, I'm gonna change the reload to one of my mouse buttons.
[47:25.29]Linksor24!
[47:27.57]Thanks, Linksor.
[47:30.30]Thanks for the resub.
[47:31.02]Okay, dodge roll, right click, reload.
[47:40.76]Mouse button four.
[47:45.61]Dodge roll, right click.
[47:49.53]No, dodge roll is going to be that.
[47:51.31]Reload is going to be this.
[47:52.51]Trying to think if that would go to bad.
[47:59.82]Use blank.
[48:00.98]Thank you very much.
[48:05.30]So that won't be Q anymore.
[48:06.82]I won't accidentally hit it.
[48:10.91]Okay, let's try that.
[48:16.84]That's... That feels a little bit better.
[48:18.70]Because now I won't accidentally hit it.
[48:26.47]Go this way first.
[48:30.07]How often can you dodge roll?
[48:31.91]As often as you'd like.
[48:34.95]The only part about dodge rolling that's not good is you can't really stop yourself.
[48:38.89]So if you run into something that you don't want to run into... And you're only invincible for the first half of the dodge.
[48:43.99]Me!
[48:44.11]6-1-7!
[48:44.67]Wow.
[48:45.07]Thanks for resetting, dude.
[48:48.36]Yikes.
[49:07.26]I'm gonna, like, fucking die here.
[49:08.40]Jeez, this enemy... This enemy sucks.
[49:23.67]What the fuck?
[49:26.13]This is not good.
[49:27.69]I'm dead.
[49:28.09]Oh my god.
[49:32.26]That guy was ridiculous.
[49:41.92]Okay.
[49:48.99]Uh, I actually... I'm going back on what I just did.
[49:51.35]That actually caused me some problems that I didn't want to have.
[50:03.02]What a lame room.
[50:03.78]Uh, that enemy's just hard.
[50:06.76]I mean, I could've... I could... I'll be fine next time I see him.
[50:10.44]It's one of those things with, uh...
[50:14.92]I'm going to make that the blank button.
[50:17.06]Reload needs to stay R. It's just too burned into my brain to not do it.
[50:20.18]Let's try a different character.
[50:22.28]The Marine.
[50:23.60]The Convict.
[50:24.28]Let's try the Convict.
[50:26.26]I'm going to test and see how much if he falls as fast as the other character.
[50:36.70]He does.
[50:37.02]What does he have for items?
[50:40.67]What does he start with?
[50:44.31]Molotov cocktail.
[50:46.99]Shotgun.
[50:49.31]And a... snub nose.
[50:55.72]So you're essentially Samson.
[50:58.60]Okie dokie.
[51:04.70]Is the donate button Frasier?
[51:11.85]No, I admire your inquisitiveness, but no, it's not Frasier.
[51:18.23]It's not Kelsey Grammar.
[51:22.44]Wait, did I not bite it?
[51:25.78]Kelsey Grammar.
[51:27.40]I don't know why I love that so much.
[51:31.53]Ah, the French champagne.
[51:32.65]It makes sense.
[51:41.59]Okay, back to normal.
[51:43.19]Here's the shotgun.
[51:48.03]I like the shotgun a lot.
[51:49.19]I very much so.
[51:52.30]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[51:59.68]Megalomaniacal Halide.
[52:01.14]I mispronounced your name last time.
[52:03.97]Hopefully I pronounced it correct.
[52:08.61]You've got a very long name.
[52:17.52]Let's take out the normal little P-gun.
[52:25.48]Oh, easy.
[52:28.81]Something I have to remember about this game is when you kill all the enemies in the room, sometimes more just appear in spawn.
[52:34.37]I need to remember that.
[52:45.18]Is that it?
[52:46.90]Is that it?
[52:48.50]Hmm.
[52:51.13]Somebody said a perfect Jupiter.
[52:52.51]Oh yeah, that is a perfect Jupiter.
[52:54.01]You're right.
[52:56.59]So Jin...
[53:09.41]If I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[53:14.85]I hope.
[53:15.82]If not, then I'm sorry, but welcome.
[53:18.46]Trying not to, like, burp.
[53:21.19]I'll give you guys like an insider streaming knowledge, like behind the scenes, insider stream knowledge.
[53:26.69]You wanna know what the hardest thing to do while streaming is?
[53:31.25]Not burp into the microphone.
[53:33.49]Cause let's face it, we all sit here, we play games and you know, hours go by, days go by, whatever, you know, however your time goes by.
[53:40.87]And you sit there, you're like, like every fucking couple hours maybe, every hour it happens.
[53:46.25]Insider streamer tip, especially people with like a webcam, when you watch them for like three hours straight and they haven't burped, they're trying so fucking hard to not do that.
[53:56.24]Inside that streamer's head, they're going, God, I'm trying to hold this burping.
[54:01.28]Alright, it's the hardest thing about being a streamer.
[54:04.92]There, there's the insider knowledge.
[54:08.64]What are all these fire rooms that I don't understand?
[54:12.82]You could mute it.
[54:14.14]I mean, there's no legit... Unless I had, like, a button.
[54:16.54]But I don't trust that shit, man.
[54:17.96]I don't.
[54:19.36]I don't trust a little button to press for me to, like, do a huge, gross burp.
[54:22.82]Because what if it doesn't work?
[54:25.38]I hit, like, let's say I bind mute to, like, T. And I press it, and I'm like, oh, thank God, nobody can hear this.
[54:32.80]The whole chat's gonna freak out.
[54:37.36]Stein jetpack.
[54:41.50]I mean, what's better, the jetpack or the Molotov cocktail?
[54:45.54]I mean, I'm gonna just use the jetpack because I'm gonna use it.
[54:52.21]Unplug the mic and then let it out.
[54:53.61]I'm gonna use the jetpack.
[54:54.39]I don't know how good it's gonna be, but whatever.
[54:57.23]Sometimes you gotta try the weird stuff.
[55:02.58]That wasn't even real.
[55:03.52]That wasn't even real.
[55:07.00]That wasn't real burp.
[55:20.03]No!
[55:20.29]That's not what I wanted!
[55:20.95]I can't believe I didn't take damage.
[55:22.95]I didn't take one point of damage there.
[55:24.59]Excellent.
[55:26.01]I am super, super stoked.
[55:29.77]Fucking gross.
[55:30.86]That's not real.
[55:31.52]That wasn't real.
[55:38.64]I like this gun, too.
[55:39.76]I mean, it sucks, but I like it.
[55:40.84]It reminds me of Clint Eastwood.
[55:44.95]I get to be Clint Eastwood!
[55:50.13]health right there.
[55:59.88]Big guns for this dude here.
[56:04.58]Wow, I didn't know those guys just explode.
[56:07.72]Well, alrighty.
[56:12.51]I have not been utilizing the slow time thing, have I?
[56:15.89]Let's see, what is it?
[56:19.15]That's actually fairly useful.
[56:21.17]But I don't like it on control.
[56:27.61]We're not done here?
[56:31.57]We got a fucking big deal.
[56:37.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:43.30]Now we're done.
[56:43.78]A lot of money from that, too.
[56:45.76]Gotta find a shop.
[56:51.67]I still have full health.
[56:53.35]Where's the shop robber?
[57:00.19]Alright.
[57:03.67]I see maps.
[57:04.77]I see table tech stun.
[57:09.64]I still can't use the flying thing.
[57:11.44]Ammo.
[57:13.36]I think I got enough ammo.
[57:15.86]I don't think I need anything from you, but you know what?
[57:17.72]I'm going to buy this.
[57:20.81]Thank you.
[57:24.45]I think that's all I want from this dude.
[57:26.91]Just don't really know what that is.
[57:35.22]Why do I wear the mask?
[57:36.62]What mask?
[57:37.80]I'm not wearing a mask.
[57:40.70]Hold on.
[57:41.40]It's been like 30 seconds.
[57:43.90]I need to make sure my hands don't turn into gravel.
[57:51.22]Jeez.
[57:52.82]Well, that room's done.
[57:56.58]Okay.
[57:58.94]Alkali-dalkali.
[58:00.02]Couple of top hat guys.
[58:15.91]I'm not really a big guy.
[58:17.37]Somebody said I'm a big guy.
[58:18.37]I'm not a big guy.
[58:20.68]I'm actually pretty small.
[58:21.72]I'm actually very small.
[58:23.48]I'm a tiny person.
[58:24.82]I'm very tiny.
[58:25.58]Key.
[58:26.46]Let's go there.
[58:43.01]There's the boss.
[58:45.75]Um, is it worth... I guess this is a pretty suspicious room down here.
[58:51.82]Let's take a look at it.
[58:57.95]We got Jerma to bane twice now, fellas?
[59:00.63]Keep it up.
[59:02.15]Why is it a contest to see how many times I bane?
[59:09.64]Ah, the fresh champagne.
[59:14.66]See, I just did bane again.
[59:17.56]Thanks a lot, Turtle.
[59:21.91]A lot of two-monthers here.
[59:22.77]A lot of two-monthers here.
[59:27.34]I need to get some more sub sounds.
[59:29.40]I do have to get them.
[59:30.60]I have to.
[59:33.30]But I'm talking about my little vacation.
[59:35.42]Anybody that cares about vacations.
[59:37.73]That looks like a really big gun.
[59:41.23]Hedge money rifle?
[59:44.95]Okie dokie.
[59:46.21]Okay.
[59:46.38]Can I shoot it through the wall?
[59:50.54]I was actually at Disney World for about a week.
[59:53.40]Disney World and Universal.
[59:54.34]Went to Harry Potter World.
[59:55.64]Went to Disney.
[59:57.32]Went to Hollywood Studios.
[60:04.98]Champ... Champachine.
[60:07.69]Champachine.
[60:10.11]Thanks.
[60:11.45]And, of course, who can forget Elmo.
[60:15.37]Elmo P.
[60:23.09]I was not in Los Angeles, I was in Florida.
[60:24.45]I'm going to use this big gun.
[60:29.21]I'm going to fly, too.
[60:30.49]This is a different boss.
[60:32.53]Who the hell?
[60:32.99]Who is this?
[60:36.82]Oh, great.
[60:39.40]I'm going to fly.
[60:45.94]Oh, I thought I was in the middle of it.
[60:47.02]I thought I was in the middle.
[60:51.15]I can't dodge roll?
[60:52.43]Oh shit, I can't dodge roll with this thing on.
[60:53.99]I have to take it off.
[61:17.37]This is like true bullet hell.
[61:24.07]I love that the dodge roll exists, though.
[61:25.55]That's a great feature.
[61:27.61]Oof, that was close.
[61:33.06]Okay, I missed it.
[61:39.68]Still don't know what these credits do.
[61:43.00]That's a new gun.
[61:45.04]The SAA, accelerating reload time.
[61:48.59]Ooh!
[61:49.97]This thing's great.
[61:54.05]I have a lot of weapons now.
[62:03.97]I just wanted to talk to him.
[62:06.61]I just murdered the guy with my giant penis gun.
[62:11.75]That was rude.
[62:12.71]I'm sorry about that.
[62:15.35]Anything else here?
[62:17.33]I got full health.
[62:18.25]Any ammo or anything?
[62:20.63]No, let's just keep going.
[62:26.98]That guy just was crying.
[62:28.44]That was not nice.
[62:38.46]Alright.
[62:40.54]The good thing is I actually have weapons to use.
[62:42.40]I don't have to use the defaults anymore.
[62:44.16]Oh my goodness, what the hell is he doing?
[62:49.28]I don't know what that was.
[62:50.12]Is he just hurting me by being on me?
[62:56.77]Kind of a lot of shit going on right now.
[62:58.71]A lot of things were just happening.
[63:00.91]Of which I did not understand.
[63:02.02]Another one of these assholes.
[63:16.14]Hold on a second.
[63:17.44]Give me the shotgun.
[63:30.39]There's just boogers running down my face right now.
[63:32.41]But I have to concentrate.
[63:35.89]I'm like, what was that?
[63:38.55]Okay, we're good.
[63:46.48]What does he have, like, a certain amount of time before he shoots him?
[64:00.93]Yeah, that was a grade A booger alert.
[64:04.15]What the fuck?
[64:05.69]What the fuck is happening right now?
[64:08.49]This game is just a game where popcorn just pops on the walls and you die.
[64:16.97]Opened the door and got fucking destroyed.
[64:18.93]I need to buy health from the shop whenever I get there.
[64:30.73]How are you?
[64:38.58]Where did these guys come from?
[64:44.65]Were these guys here before?
[64:45.75]What the heck?
[64:55.05]What's next?
[64:55.63]Anybody?
[64:55.93]There's still people here.
[64:56.75]There's another one of these guys.
[65:00.13]Oh, for the love of all that is sacred.
[65:02.51]Just fly.
[65:09.89]No, the flying is a bad idea.
[65:14.03]Oh my god.
[65:19.27]Oh, this game is fucking hard.
[65:26.84]Okay, well, we're going to do it again.
[65:27.96]This is one of those hard games, isn't it?
[65:52.46]Okay.
[65:59.68]Left side of town.
[66:00.52]Welcome back.
[66:10.57]Not to be confused with the guy from the right side of town here from the left.
[66:13.29]I will always remember that.
[66:37.18]Is it a box?
[66:38.04]Nice ammo.
[66:38.96]Easy.
[67:06.59]For the candy soldiers, a jug of whiskey.
[67:09.76]Double vision.
[67:10.46]One for each of you.
[67:14.12]Okay.
[67:15.82]Not entirely sure what that's supposed to be, but I'm going to use it at some point.
[67:23.86]You guys are making Kinder Surprise Egg Jupiters.
[67:32.97]Son of a heck.
[67:35.19]Son of a heck.
[67:47.90]Goodbye.
[67:48.40]Just gotta strafe around these guys.
[68:08.50]An old video camera.
[68:10.70]Say cheese.
[68:13.46]This is a weapon?
[68:16.27]This is an actual weapon in the game.
[68:17.95]It's a flash camera.
[68:21.37]It's only got 60 uses.
[68:22.11]I kind of don't want to use it.
[68:23.65]We'll just see what it does.
[68:31.44]What does this do?
[68:32.20]I don't know what this does.
[68:40.76]stupidest weapon ever.
[68:45.92]I'm sure there's like a reason to use that, but I just don't know what it is.
[68:48.68]Does it just hit everybody on screen that's in the line of sight?
[68:51.94]I need a key.
[69:06.13]The locked doors look like toast.
[69:08.03]They kind of do.
[69:09.92]I need key.
[69:16.86]Okay, I'm holding the button.
[69:18.80]I'm doing what everyone told me to do.
[69:20.24]I'm gonna hold the button and I'm gonna let it go.
[69:21.50]Alright, this thing is pretty awesome actually.
[69:29.93]I'm gonna use that another time when there's more enemies in the room.
[69:41.99]How much is just a half-heart?
[69:43.78]20.
[69:44.30]What a rip-off.
[69:45.06]20.
[69:45.52]20.
[69:45.54]How much is the key?
[69:51.29]25.
[69:51.63]How do you ever expect anyone to buy your shit?
[69:58.17]Should I just try to rob them and run?
[70:00.28]No.
[70:00.94]I'm not doing that.
[70:01.58]That's a bad idea.
[70:14.11]Man, go away, slime.
[70:16.79]Is this game permadeath?
[70:17.98]Yes.
[70:19.06]It is a... Kind of like Climbing of Isaac.
[70:28.38]What a weird item.
[70:33.38]What a weird item, you know?
[70:35.40]There's the key.
[70:37.13]And what do I want ammo for?
[70:40.61]Get it for the camera.
[70:41.33]Why not?
[70:47.67]Records?
[70:49.75]Laser sight.
[70:52.09]Cool.
[70:55.12]I got a feeling this is kind of going to give me a headache.
[71:00.26]Is this hurting anybody else's head?
[71:01.64]Uh...
[71:19.30]Yikes.
[71:23.24]Oh, boy.
[71:24.56]Oh, boy.
[71:28.88]It helps.
[71:29.70]It actually does help.
[71:36.61]Much easier.
[71:40.71]I used the key already, didn't I?
[71:42.63]Let's see what's over here.
[71:45.43]I don't even know what the jug does.
[71:46.45]I haven't even tried to use it yet.
[71:50.20]There's the boss room.
[71:57.44]Kind of want the heart.
[72:02.75]Let's try... Okay.
[72:07.99]Let's see if I can beat the first boss.
[72:11.37]It's the penguin again.
[72:16.72]Come on, penguin.
[72:20.32]Not the penguin.
[72:22.36]What is it?
[72:23.52]What is?
[72:29.33]Gatling Gull!
[72:32.75]And... let's do it!
[72:34.07]I'm not sure what it does.
[72:41.95]It's alright, let's take some pictures.
[72:46.23]Oh, this thing is insane against bosses.
[72:52.77]He's just gonna get hurt.
[72:59.43]I like sightseeing.
[73:00.39]What a weird tourist.
[73:02.19]Oh, do you see those missiles drop?
[73:03.55]Wow, look at that.
[73:04.89]Okay, no more fucking around.
[73:06.81]I don't wanna die here.
[73:07.77]I didn't mean to do that.
[73:26.62]This doesn't really do much damage though.
[73:29.48]Go back with the shotgun.
[73:39.75]Get away!
[73:44.43]I don't know if he's jumping or not.
[73:53.30]That's the one problem.
[73:56.26]That's the range.
[73:56.78]I'm just barely out of range.
[74:12.31]Yikes.
[74:12.67]I just don't like the ring around the Rosie game I'm playing with him right now.
[74:19.53]I don't like the ring around the... You hear that like voice crack?
[74:23.48]I promise that's because I'm sick.
[74:24.62]Nobody make fun of me.
[74:37.10]What a sturdy bookshelf.
[74:38.04]It really is a sturdy bookshelf.
[74:39.40]We're fine.
[74:50.61]He doesn't usually do that.
[74:52.37]Come on, I'm not feeling well.
[74:59.35]This is a new weapon.
[75:01.17]The Jolter.
[75:05.71]I like how fat the bullets are with this thing.
[75:08.63]Still don't know what the jug does.
[75:10.40]What does it do?
[75:12.50]So it just doubles the shots?
[75:14.28]Doubles the amount of bullets it can shoot or something?
[75:18.85]Better accuracy.
[75:28.73]Sooner or later I'll start noticing girls and see hair in funny places.
[75:32.56]I don't have enough money for anything.
[75:43.00]Let's-a go.
[75:52.10]Can I use caps lock here?
[75:55.26]I think you can, but not an overabundant amount.
[75:59.91]Like, if you use more than six words that are caps, I'm pretty sure it times you out.
[76:07.59]I'm a pretty lenient guy, but the one rule that I have...
[76:12.49]Don't take it too far.
[76:14.43]Don't go overboard.
[76:15.49]Did I not just get hit by that?
[76:21.83]I'm really making my life a living hell over here, buddy.
[76:33.00]Ah!
[76:34.14]Did it bounce off the wall, or did I just get hit by it?
[76:36.27]I must have just gotten hit by it, not paying attention.
[76:43.64]Let's see what this thing is.
[76:46.00]These are new enemies that I don't know what the hell they do.
[76:49.62]This thing actually is pretty damn good.
[76:58.99]Why does the guy have a squid on his head?
[77:04.85]Is somebody still alive?
[77:06.01]Yep.
[77:06.23]That guy actually scared the hell out of me.
[77:09.68]He had this crazed look in his eye and he was sprinting at me.
[77:14.94]I don't have any med kits or anything.
[77:20.61]God fucking dammit.
[77:27.81]Oh my god!
[77:31.99]Somebody subbed too.
[77:35.25]Who was it?
[77:35.65]Oh, it was Red Ranger again.
[77:40.28]Red Ranger with like the 75th sub.
[77:49.58]He is here.
[77:50.78]He's a different character.
[77:54.38]Is this guy not tanky?
[77:57.44]Harder than Dark Souls?
[77:58.92]No, it's just full of hell.
[78:02.14]You have to learn every enemy.
[78:07.07]Tiger Lotus, thanks again.
[78:08.15]And thank you, Red Ranger.
[78:09.61]I know I said thanks, but thanks.
[78:12.11]I know I said thanks, but thanks.
[78:20.01]Let me try one of the other characters.
[78:29.24]What about the Marine?
[78:30.34]Let me try this guy.
[78:34.33]With any game that's like a bullet hell type game, you just have to memorize the enemies.
[78:39.99]Because when you start to see new people, like the guy that was sprinting at me, I don't know what the hell that was.
[78:43.49]That guy was terrifying.
[78:45.07]I don't know.
[78:45.75]What was that?
[78:46.17]Who was that guy?
[78:51.26]What can I do with these picket fence posts, by the way?
[78:56.29]Is there something special I can do with the white picket fence?
[79:01.41]It's like a shop or something in town I can look at.
[79:08.67]Or do I have to unlock that or something?
[79:09.95]Because I don't think there's anything over here.
[79:17.23]You reset on this account?
[79:18.21]Red Ranger 8.
[79:22.65]Need to unlock the shopkeeper.
[79:23.77]Okay.
[79:25.37]You can build a house.
[79:28.07]That's kind of neat.
[79:30.29]What does he do?
[79:34.23]Calls in an ammo drop.
[79:35.41]That's kind of cool.
[79:38.35]Does not reveal secret walls and re-inside on his bar.
[79:40.65]So, okay.
[79:44.52]Better reload speed and weapon accuracy right off the bat.
[79:47.60]That's actually...
[79:49.78]I think I like this character a lot.
[79:51.46]We'll find out though.
[79:55.24]Let's try not to take any unnecessary damage.
[80:11.04]Is he dead?
[80:18.84]Okay, he's dead.
[80:20.02]I got him.
[80:20.90]I'm starting to see how necessary the table flipping really has become.
[80:34.05]It helps a lot.
[80:34.73]Although it blocks you as well, so you can't shoot either.
[80:47.80]He is so much more accurate.
[80:50.48]The other guys would have their ship going like this.
[80:52.34]And I played Binding of Isaac.
[80:57.25]Oh yeah, I played the hell out of Binding of Isaac.
[80:59.01]I have like 200 hours in Binding of Isaac.
[81:02.55]I would compare this game more to Nuclear Trump.
[81:09.76]Than I would Binding of Isaac.
[81:11.90]It's like a combination of those two games.
[81:14.32]Dueling Pistol.
[81:17.25]One shot, huh?
[81:19.33]Let's give it a go.
[81:22.77]I would say right off the bat, this game is probably more kind of Twitch-based than Isaac is.
[81:30.52]You need a lot more reaction shots and reaction times in Isaac.
[81:34.24]Isaac is more about slowly kind of making your way through and not getting hit.
[81:38.98]Whereas this is like a legit bullet hell murder shoot everybody game.
[81:45.71]Isaac felt a little more calculated, where this is kind of extreme action.
[81:54.78]I'm having a fun time, though.
[81:57.34]I mean, I haven't beaten the second boss, but I'm still having a good time learning things.
[82:03.17]I think there's a lot of damage.
[82:10.05]Quite a bit.
[82:10.87]He's got a lot of ammo, too.
[82:30.04]One thing I can't say that I love so far in the first kind of 30, 40 minutes of the game of playing it is the spawning enemies in the room.
[82:40.11]I guess I'm just very used to a game like Isaac where... Alright, here's your threat.
[82:44.37]Take care of the threat and move on.
[82:46.69]Where a lot of times you'll go in a room, clear the threat, and then wait a second, there's like another wave of enemies here.
[82:53.47]I can't say that's my favorite feature of the game, but I just probably have to get used to it.
[82:57.64]I would assume.
[82:58.32]But, who knows.
[83:01.26]Just wanted to push it over.
[83:11.59]25.
[83:11.61]I don't think I can get anything.
[83:24.60]Ooh.
[83:31.35]I like this gun, though.
[83:33.11]This gun is doing me a lot of favors.
[83:38.37]I can do an ammo drop.
[83:40.33]But I'm not going to do that.
[83:41.05]How much does an ammo drop do?
[83:42.15]How much does it give you?
[83:45.59]Okay.
[83:46.46]I've never seen this room before.
[83:47.70]But this is just a key?
[83:50.06]I guess, yeah.
[83:53.90]I need another key to get this.
[83:55.16]Alright.
[83:57.28]I'll find one.
[84:08.99]Kill the bird.
[84:09.71]I don't want the bird to cause all these problems, because it will.
[84:21.16]Die.
[84:23.22]Finally.
[84:27.34]Nothing in here.
[84:30.80]Just gives you max ammo, so then I'm not going to use it now then.
[84:35.12]I will hold on to it.
[84:42.71]Uh, down here is the only place I haven't gone, I think.
[84:47.03]Oh, I think.
[84:53.94]I will try, boss.
[84:56.42]I will try.
[84:57.08]Thanks for something.
[84:58.68]Welcome to the friend family.
[85:02.02]Where everybody here is a best friend.
[85:08.65]That's him in the back of the head.
[85:11.91]That ricocheted off the wall and hit him in the skull.
[85:14.63]And he made this surprised, awful noise.
[85:17.61]Like, oh, jeez!
[85:19.57]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[85:34.10]Guys, I love you.
[85:43.67]No keys.
[85:46.15]Well, we're gonna go to the shop and see if we can buy two keys.
[85:54.14]I think that's just the boss room, but we'll find out.
[86:04.59]No, it's not.
[86:20.76]I don't even need my active.
[86:22.38]Damn.
[86:25.52]Shit.
[86:27.74]The chest blew up.
[86:28.52]What do you mean the chest blew up?
[86:33.87]Why would the chest blow up?
[86:35.37]Am I going to PAX East this year?
[86:43.71]I hope so.
[86:44.53]I need to get a badge.
[86:50.85]Because I didn't get one when they first came on sale.
[86:53.81]Gas mask.
[86:54.77]You don't have any keys?
[86:55.57]Are you kidding me?
[86:59.77]What does the gas mask do?
[87:02.69]Oh, I didn't get it.
[87:05.23]I have no idea what this does, but I just bought it.
[87:08.42]Prevents poison damage.
[87:09.62]Okay.
[87:12.14]Probably could have guessed.
[87:17.65]Shoot in the shop room.
[87:19.40]Somebody already got me.
[87:21.50]So... You can't get me.
[87:23.88]I was already gotten.
[87:24.72]Am I really not gonna get three chests?
[87:28.75]That sucks.
[87:31.65]What can you do?
[87:43.79]Can you skip these cutscenes, like, after you've seen them, like, three times already?
[87:46.73]I feel like they're quite long.
[87:55.00]Gatling Gull.
[87:57.44]No unnecessary damage.
[88:01.18]Good thing the bushes were just blocking my way.
[88:03.86]Asshole, I wasn't gonna do that to you.
[88:08.28]I would've hide this time, unfortunately.
[88:42.71]utilize my blasters effectively.
[88:47.47]Where is he?
[88:47.99]Yeah, the ricochet gun ain't going to do me any favors here.
[89:02.34]What?
[89:03.38]Aye, aye, aye.
[89:15.91]This is very bad.
[89:21.20]Ugh.
[89:21.32]I might lose.
[89:39.93]Ah, fuck!
[89:42.59]God damn it, I'm not very good at this.
[89:51.09]I'm having trouble with the WASD and the dodging.
[89:57.14]I played all of Isaac with a controller.
[89:59.56]So WASD is very foreign to me in these games.
[90:06.74]Attracted to bullets.
[90:08.88]Kind of.
[90:15.09]Like, you know what it is?
[90:15.77]It's a combination of, like, the dodging with WASD top-down.
[90:22.31]I'd much rather use the controller.
[90:25.16]But I don't think it really works that well.
[90:27.70]Let me look at what the buttons are.
[90:33.16]Let's see.
[90:39.36]Right bumper is shoot.
[90:40.50]Well, that needs to change.
[90:44.64]The game with controller is better, in your opinion?
[90:48.86]Well, Red Ranger 8 apparently just resubscribed.
[90:52.40]She strikes again.
[90:57.63]You use controller too?
[90:59.29]I heard the controller's hard because it's not, like, uh... I'll give it a try.
[91:04.03]Because I'm having a lot of trouble with the WASD.
[91:07.07]Claiming!
[91:07.51]Whoa!
[91:16.43]Claim it underscore.
[91:17.21]Welcome.
[91:17.49]Thanks, dude.
[91:18.93]Interact AX.
[91:23.08]Next gun.
[91:24.54]Left trigger's map.
[91:31.66]What is right trigger even bound to in the first place?
[91:40.07]Y. You can actually drop items, too.
[91:42.37]That's cool.
[91:49.60]Let's give it a try.
[91:51.98]Was it gonna go straight up default?
[91:57.71]Let's see.
[91:59.89]Utopia Fox, thanks for the two months.
[92:02.67]Like I said, look, a lot of two-monthers.
[92:03.86]We got a lot of two-monthers.
[92:17.85]Okay.
[92:18.71]I already like the dodge roll.
[92:19.85]It's much easier.
[92:20.45]It feels much cleaner.
[92:22.67]But I'm not so sure about this.
[92:25.72]It needs to be right trigger.
[92:30.26]For sure.
[92:35.86]PS4 recommended.
[92:37.10]I'll just do my own.
[92:39.96]Shoot.
[92:40.36]Right trigger.
[92:41.70]Dodge roll.
[92:42.94]Left bumper.
[92:43.82]Oh, it's B.
[92:46.52]AX and the rest is kind of use item will be right bumper use blank will be left bumper no I want that to be use item will be left trigger use blank will be left bumper no
[93:15.30]Right trigger, shoot.
[93:16.32]Dodge rolls, B. A, interact.
[93:17.96]X, reload.
[93:21.08]Trigger, use item.
[93:24.85]Kind of need something for the map.
[93:25.95]I'll just do, like, back.
[93:28.57]Whatever.
[93:32.09]Okay.
[93:33.03]Let's see how that works.
[93:37.46]That's, uh... Yeah, I think I like this a lot better.
[93:44.76]A lot better.
[93:47.81]We'll see.
[93:49.99]We'll see how it goes.
[93:50.99]Okay, I didn't even press that button and it happened.
[94:01.65]I can already tell there needs to be a change.
[94:04.41]I'm going to go with... Dodge Roll is going to be A. Interactive will be B.
[94:16.84]Use blank.
[94:17.50]I did not hit left bumper.
[94:20.60]I'm so far away from left bumper.
[94:23.62]Should not have happened.
[94:24.33]Let's keep going.
[94:43.69]Alright, something actually kind of odd is going on.
[94:47.01]You guys noticing that when I'm aiming this way, the whole screen is moving over here?
[94:51.45]I feel like I wasn't doing that before.
[94:56.49]It's actually kind of freaking me out.
[94:58.58]It's pushing me all the way to the left and right of the screen.
[95:01.82]Because I'm aiming up there.
[95:05.50]This might be a failed experiment, guys.
[95:11.02]You see what I'm talking about?
[95:11.90]Look where I am.
[95:13.22]It's because I'm holding... Yeah.
[95:15.04]No way.
[95:21.90]I'm stuck on the edges of the screen.
[95:23.84]Yeah, I do not like this.
[95:27.91]Back to bed.
[95:30.99]You see when I move my mouse around?
[95:33.31]It's not like this.
[95:38.16]Alright, whatever.
[95:39.02]We tried.
[95:39.48]We tried, controller.
[95:40.58]It didn't work.
[95:44.34]Yeah, that's a big no way.
[95:55.91]Yeah, even I'm like aiming better.
[95:57.29]No, no.
[95:57.87]No way.
[96:03.21]I saw that there's a thing in the controls, right?
[96:05.65]Where maybe I could change the sensitivity on how far it moves?
[96:10.71]Steam control?
[96:11.25]I could imagine the steam controller being incredible for this.
[96:38.83]Tango Slapper.
[96:42.81]Two months.
[96:45.01]Two full months.
[96:46.33]60 days.
[96:46.61]6-0.
[96:47.92]What the hell is this gun?
[96:52.86]A backup gun?
[96:55.86]Watch your back.
[96:57.24]Oh!
[96:58.90]Interesting.
[96:59.42]Interesting indeed.
[97:15.49]Let me move my ass around a little bit.
[97:17.48]Hold on a second, guys.
[97:18.14]I want to get a little more comfortable.
[97:20.68]You know how comfortable you can't play games like this?
[97:22.96]I'm sorry for the loud noises I'm making with this.
[97:26.72]I'm gonna move this here.
[97:29.62]I'm taking my fucking pants off, you know what I mean?
[97:32.86]It's like, you know what I'm talking about?
[97:35.44]Sometimes you gotta undo a button when you're too fat like me.
[97:38.25]I'm getting fat, did I tell you that?
[97:39.63]You guys know that yet?
[97:42.92]Okay, like moving around too much.
[97:45.20]I'm hitting buttons that I shouldn't be hitting I'm just like gonna scooch around My pants are still on I'm just shuffling around a little
[98:12.03]Alright, let's do it.
[98:25.07]Alrighty.
[98:41.87]Just turn around and shoot him.
[98:43.46]I wanted the last hit to be a backwards shot.
[98:45.28]I need some more coffee.
[98:53.20]My head is starting to do that thing.
[98:54.26]You know when you get sick and your head is doing that thing?
[98:56.05]Where it feels like you have two heads on your shoulders?
[99:00.47]Like you're looking through somebody else's eyes.
[99:03.39]When you get like that headache-y feel?
[99:05.93]That's kind of happening.
[99:09.57]Excuse.
[99:10.39]Excuses.
[99:12.09]How many excuses is that?
[99:13.91]That's like five excuses.
[99:15.27]Let's get like six.
[99:25.59]His default gun is really not that bad.
[99:27.21]What does this mean?
[99:38.73]Uh, I'm not sure.
[99:43.01]Two heads on your shoulders.
[99:45.13]Coffee more like ice water.
[99:46.23]It's ice coffee.
[99:47.89]Where's this key?
[99:51.01]There's so much trash on the ground, I don't know where this key is.
[99:54.07]There it is.
[99:54.39]What the hell is this?
[100:02.86]Shrine to a prideful bullet angel now fallen.
[100:05.08]Offer a blood sacrifice.
[100:08.95]Sacrifice accepted stronger Red Ranger 6 How do you keep track of these accounts?
[100:31.29]Do you know the password to all these accounts?
[100:36.60]I feel like if I had, like, 15 accounts on Twitch, I would probably forget the password.
[100:43.22]Unless, uh, they're all the same password, which in that case, that's not secure!
[100:46.78]Piece of cheese there.
[100:56.79]Still a guy.
[101:00.36]Where's the dumb book?
[101:05.44]shop.
[101:05.70]I don't think I have any money.
[101:06.96]I have 23.
[101:13.11]Wax wings?
[101:17.23]Yeah, I don't have enough for anything.
[101:19.75]It's like a shriveled up lychee trigger finger.
[101:25.92]Huh.
[101:26.88]This guy again.
[101:27.56]I don't know.
[101:29.28]Did you bring something?
[101:33.12]Because I can drop him shit, right?
[101:36.58]Should I drop something?
[101:38.22]I'm going to drop him this active.
[101:40.80]Why not, right?
[101:41.94]How do you do it?
[101:42.86]Is it just down on the D-pad or something?
[101:44.39]Not the D-pad.
[101:45.05]I'm using keyboard controls.
[101:49.47]Use blank.
[101:50.31]Drop item.
[101:51.49]G. I'm curious.
[101:54.23]If I just throw this in front of him, what does he do?
[101:59.70]Ooh, he gives you money.
[102:02.02]He gives you money.
[102:04.36]Alright, now I'll get the lichy trigger finger.
[102:09.38]No!
[102:09.78]No!
[102:10.08]I was testing the weapon!
[102:11.24]I was testing it!
[102:15.18]Jesus Christ.
[102:21.28]Get me out of there.
[102:29.16]Okay.
[102:30.39]I'm fine.
[102:37.55]Nice.
[102:40.55]Dumb hallway.
[102:45.77]That does kinda help.
[102:46.71]Too many things.
[102:59.54]Too many things on the screen.
[103:11.06]You're dumb.
[103:12.09]Hey.
[103:14.19]No, I'm eccentric.
[103:15.71]There's a difference.
[103:16.39]Ooh, I like this.
[103:32.36]Straight down.
[103:40.63]God damn it!
[103:43.71]It's been burned in my brain like I told you guys before.
[103:46.43]When you kill all enemies in the room, you're safe.
[103:49.11]That's not the case with this game and I need to start remembering that.
[103:53.00]I need to forget everything I remember about Isaac and just play this game.
[104:01.67]It's kind of hard to lose all that memory though, especially when you put that much time into it.
[104:19.00]Okay.
[104:21.54]Well, let's try not to die, the boss.
[104:25.51]Oh, it's the king.
[104:26.41]This guy wasn't that bad.
[104:34.37]Let's go, king bullet.
[104:49.66]Did I already kill the guy?
[104:54.80]No, get away from me.
[105:02.27]Well, those ones sped up real fast.
[105:27.18]I got him.
[105:28.02]Is anything behind this?
[105:38.90]Can I not get it?
[105:40.11]Give me it.
[105:40.71]Move the chair.
[105:41.25]There's another health right here.
[105:43.59]There's seriously another health right here, isn't there?
[105:49.77]Yeah, I can't touch this?
[105:52.32]The stupid throne is in the way.
[106:00.66]I can't move this chair.
[106:01.48]Are you kidding me?
[106:05.36]Okay, I can blow it up.
[106:08.02]This is crazy.
[106:10.90]I don't know if I can use this weapon.
[106:14.71]I'm probably gonna die because of this weapon.
[106:30.13]We'll see.
[106:30.68]We'll see how long I last with the Ghostbusters reverse gun.
[106:41.66]Okay, it's pretty good.
[106:42.47]It's actually kind of good.
[106:44.41]Holy shit, I'm using so much ammo, though.
[106:46.85]We're not going to use that.
[107:00.91]There you go.
[107:03.63]Stupid magician.
[107:08.35]Don't cross the streams.
[107:09.22]I know, you told me not to cross the streams, but I have two streams coming out.
[107:12.66]It's inevitably gonna happen.
[107:14.04]Inevitably?
[107:15.22]Inevitably.
[107:15.84]Alright, well, time to lose.
[107:19.12]Time to lose, because I'm very... You guys know how bad I am at stuff like this.
[107:22.55]I'm gonna fucking lose.
[107:25.49]Right now.
[107:25.85]I'm gonna fall through and die.
[107:32.97]I made it.
[107:36.97]No key.
[107:42.22]No key.
[107:44.12]Whoa.
[107:45.86]Huh?
[107:47.64]I need a key.
[107:53.94]What is going on in there?
[107:56.56]Okay, I'll come back.
[107:57.90]I'll come back to that.
[108:04.16]What's going on here?
[108:06.71]The altar is empty.
[108:12.23]Oh.
[108:13.05]Okay.
[108:17.32]Just save the person in there?
[108:21.48]I can try.
[108:38.97]Got ya.
[108:41.55]Nothing in here?
[108:43.06]I don't think so.
[108:45.32]I don't think so.
[108:47.88]Good luck finding keys, I know.
[108:49.46]That's been the story of this whole stream.
[108:52.71]No keys and dying to the second boss.
[108:55.57]Or the second room.
[109:07.84]You know what else is giving me trouble, too, internally in my brain?
[109:12.12]It's shoot or dodge.
[109:14.29]I'm trying to do both at the same time, but you have to pick one.
[109:16.73]Shoot, dodge, or reload.
[109:22.69]My brain is mixing them together.
[109:26.89]Like a big pot.
[109:29.21]Bad stew that you don't want to eat.
[109:48.90]God, that enemy sucks!
[110:01.79]Fuck this whole room, dude.
[110:03.09]Like, seriously, that was unbearable.
[110:05.96]I'm still alive.
[110:07.32]I keep... Those... These are the rooms that I keep dying in.
[110:10.54]It's these rooms that are the worst.
[110:12.36]If I didn't have the proton back, I definitely would have lost.
[110:20.70]Why can't I go in here?
[110:22.93]Is he... He's angry with me?
[110:23.91]Is that the problem?
[110:28.57]I'm in such deep shit.
[110:29.67]Where's that health that it was... Yeah, it's back here.
[110:47.44]Yeah, that room was no joke.
[110:50.32]They don't mess around in this game.
[110:51.54]Alright.
[110:54.80]I'm going to have to try to get my way to the boss room because I'm going to die.
[110:57.75]I don't have any keys.
[111:20.21]Ooh, ammo.
[111:21.47]Definitely for the proton pack.
[111:24.81]And when I get to the boss, we're just proton packing that guy.
[111:28.75]And hoping that I don't die.
[111:32.39]Shit.
[111:33.23]Never mind, we're using it here.
[111:45.22]Oh, god damn it.
[111:46.84]I hate that enemy so much.
[111:50.00]That guy sucks.
[111:51.10]I hate it.
[111:51.66]He shoots you like three times with the same bullets.
[111:55.74]They don't disappear.
[111:56.98]And they're huge projectiles.
[112:04.37]I can buy a key.
[112:05.17]I need to buy the health too.
[112:09.01]24, 30, 40, 50.
[112:10.27]I have like just barely enough.
[112:15.32]What chest am I going to open?
[112:26.75]Do chests have rarities on them?
[112:28.55]Should I open the green one?
[112:29.65]Or this one over here?
[112:31.06]Or should I open the door with the person in it?
[112:32.62]I'm kind of scared of that room, to be honest.
[112:38.40]Is this guy going to attack me?
[112:44.02]I mean, if I can hit two times, I'm dead.
[112:49.41]I don't think I want to do this.
[112:53.16]Okay, you know what?
[112:53.92]I'm going to do it.
[112:55.04]I can't do it.
[112:55.50]I don't have the right key.
[112:57.04]He told me no.
[113:03.41]Soda pop.
[113:05.61]Shotka Cola.
[113:06.73]Speed up.
[113:07.79]That actually helps a lot.
[113:10.63]That does help a lot.
[113:12.97]But is it going to be enough?
[113:21.03]Is it going to be enough?
[113:32.39]Fire.
[113:37.09]Speed seems to help.
[113:43.06]That's not it.
[113:45.36]More people!
[113:54.55]Who else is here?
[114:04.33]Still more places to go too.
[114:08.03]Okay.
[114:08.73]Where's the boss room?
[114:13.81]Alright, cross your fingers, hope there's a key in here or health.
[114:22.66]Doesn't look like there's either one of those types.
[114:31.81]Okay, I have proton pack and sidearm.
[114:39.26]Damn it!
[114:43.84]What's with the no key drops?
[114:49.50]Alright, wish me luck.
[114:51.34]I don't think... I have not seen the second boss yet, so... Let's go.
[114:57.59]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[114:59.03]Alright, it's... Medusa.
[115:06.30]Medusa with two machine guns.
[115:07.62]The Gorgon!
[115:10.12]Alright, just burn her.
[115:10.82]Burn her!
[115:11.78]Burn her!
[115:15.34]Oh boy.
[115:17.52]That's definitely poison.
[115:23.80]My fucking goddammit.
[115:26.01]Jesus.
[115:29.59]Okay, so she circles around with poison and then fills the screen with bullets.
[115:37.18]Got it.
[115:54.05]I'm actually, like, having fun.
[115:55.85]Because I'm getting my ass kicked.
[116:01.98]But I don't feel like it's not angering me.
[116:06.16]I feel like I'm learning things.
[116:07.28]Because typically I would be very angry, you know?
[116:25.77]This game's fun.
[116:27.51]So far, so good.
[116:29.85]So far, so good.
[116:41.04]Yeah, when you die in this game, like, now that I, like, have learned a lot of the game mechanics...
[116:48.55]The game is so fast-paced that I feel like I can just get back to where I was before in like a minute or two.
[116:56.26]Even though it's already been like an hour.
[116:57.56]Like, if I wasn't making any progress at all, then I'd probably be mad.
[117:11.85]Finally, a key.
[117:13.31]Needed one of those desperately.
[117:18.80]Sponsorship confirmed.
[117:21.42]You can roll through sources of poison or fire to avoid taking damage.
[117:25.42]Even if it's that much poison on the ground.
[117:26.88]Because there was a lot of poison on that ground.
[117:30.08]A lot.
[117:34.24]I guess I've never been poisoned, so I just don't know how much damage it does.
[117:38.27]Like, if you get caught in it, does it kill you?
[117:40.47]Does it tick for, like, five or ten or something?
[117:44.21]Five or ten.
[117:47.31]What am I talking about?
[117:49.38]There is no denomination of 5 or 10 for health in this game.
[117:53.11]Let's do 5 or 10.
[118:05.64]Rabid test subject.
[118:08.54]Thank you for subscribing.
[118:13.42]Welcome to the family.
[118:14.40]Enjoy your emotes.
[118:22.50]Whoa!
[118:25.46]I don't want to get stuck in this room, but I'm gonna have to just pick people off.
[118:38.79]Good to go.
[118:40.03]And a chest.
[118:40.63]Where is it?
[118:41.99]There it is.
[118:44.33]Fresh honey.
[118:46.13]Potion of gun friendship.
[118:47.79]Temporary plus one to gun.
[118:52.37]I don't know what that even means, but we're going to keep it.
[118:56.83]Speaking of guns, I could really use a new one.
[119:02.98]Ah, the French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[119:10.42]Fapple Dapple.
[119:13.13]Welcome back.
[119:14.87]Welcome back, Fapple Dapple.
[119:18.31]Okay.
[119:20.89]Lowercase a.
[119:28.80]What the fuck is this item?
[119:36.43]Okay.
[119:37.35]It has a lot of ammo.
[119:39.39]I guess we're gonna use it.
[119:48.24]Thanks for the supply drop, nerd.
[119:51.76]What?
[119:52.04]What?
[119:54.33]Did somebody steal my item?
[119:56.19]Was that a rat?
[119:58.85]I think a rat just took my item.
[120:06.42]This thing's insane.
[120:07.44]This thing does a ton of damage.
[120:10.94]I mean, it's really annoying, but... It gets the job done, right?
[120:25.27]Wow.
[120:25.77]Speaking of bullets, I didn't even see these guys behind me.
[120:40.54]Got some ammo.
[120:43.96]Heavy boots.
[120:48.79]Low center of mass.
[120:54.84]No idea.
[120:56.26]Allows a gun engineer to keep their footing even when great forces... So you don't get knocked back anymore?
[121:03.88]Temporarily increase... This is what, like, kind of like... Book of Belial.
[121:10.09]To give a reference, I guess.
[121:15.25]I don't have enough money for any of your stuff.
[121:22.63]Hmm...
[121:27.98]I guess we're going to go over here.
[121:35.98]Um... Sometimes you just gotta go, right?
[121:40.08]Sometimes you just gotta go.
[121:41.54]And that time is now.
[121:43.64]You just gotta go.
[121:44.26]Let's try this item.
[122:36.87]The further away you are, the better too.
[122:38.21]That's why I was getting up on his face there.
[122:41.35]Die!
[122:41.49]Where is he?
[122:46.79]Am I hitting him?
[122:51.08]Okay, good.
[123:11.12]More of these credits.
[123:14.15]More of these space picket fence credits.
[123:17.63]And keys.
[123:20.55]Buzzkill!
[123:25.73]Are you crying?
[123:28.96]Was that your king?
[123:30.72]Get fucking sawed!
[123:39.22]Uh, wasn't there a chest that I couldn't open?
[123:46.32]Is there anything else I could buy?
[123:47.28]I'm not sure I'll give it a go.
[123:52.09]Why not?
[123:55.39]What a monster.
[124:05.39]This actually might mess me up because it's going to be bouncing all over the place.
[124:08.97]See how much damage it does.
[124:09.87]Ow, hello.
[124:13.81]Dammit.
[124:23.87]stuff.
[124:27.67]He just did it.
[124:28.51]He did the thing I did.
[124:32.84]Um, I kind of like this better.
[124:35.24]It takes longer to kill things, but... Ah, the French Champagne.
[124:48.39]That was not celebrated for its excellence.
[124:54.05]Morty Ragey.
[124:55.85]Or Morty Raggy.
[124:56.70]I think it's Ragey.
[124:58.96]Thanks for subbing.
[124:59.46]Thanks for resubbing.
[125:02.96]You are back.
[125:04.86]Even though you've never left.
[125:17.13]He's just gotta go.
[125:19.47]He's got speed, man.
[125:20.67]I'm taking my time.
[125:21.69]You can't take your time.
[125:26.29]Taking your time is a mistake.
[125:27.34]You just gotta go and you gotta get them dead.
[125:30.54]Immediately.
[125:32.76]Don't wait around for Christmas.
[125:36.54]Just kill them.
[125:39.10]Don't be scared.
[125:39.86]Are we gone?
[125:49.97]Are they dead?
[125:50.79]Jeez.
[125:51.15]Oh hi, Etalyx.
[125:57.71]I'm playing this fun game.
[126:02.48]Three keys.
[126:04.26]What is this?
[126:12.90]Rido.
[126:14.19]Welcome, Rido.
[126:17.97]Can I open this?
[126:19.65]Is he going to freak out if I touch this?
[126:21.87]Is that his secret gun chest?
[126:23.09]Is he going to start shooting me or something?
[126:25.67]What happens if I open that?
[126:27.19]I don't know.
[126:30.78]I don't really need anything right now.
[126:32.08]Nothing in here is really any good.
[126:39.00]Prime primer?
[126:43.42]I kind of want to open this and just run.
[126:46.64]You feed it two guns to get one gun.
[126:48.46]That's what it is.
[126:50.22]Well, I kind of like my guns.
[126:55.89]I don't sound sick, did I take cold medicine?
[126:58.69]It's more of like a head problem than it is like a nose and throat problem.
[127:05.07]I mean, I've been like kind of stuffy, but... It's mostly like... I don't even know what's in the room.
[127:16.24]It doesn't blend in.
[127:17.16]I might have to go buy that health now.
[127:34.48]Get away from me.
[127:39.18]Get away, you tiny little shithead.
[127:48.05]Meg Deshpi.
[127:53.01]I hate these rooms so much.
[127:55.81]Meg Deshpi, thanks for something.
[127:58.25]Now I have to go get healed.
[128:03.05]These rooms are seriously the worst.
[128:11.46]I have to do it.
[128:15.64]And should I take the ammo too?
[128:18.58]Maybe.
[128:19.94]No.
[128:22.74]But thanks for subbing, Mr. Shpee.
[128:25.28]Megda Shpee.
[128:31.88]Not another one.
[128:38.89]I didn't even see the middle.
[128:48.82]God damn!
[129:03.85]Now we're in deep shit again.
[129:08.08]Use your Q. I want to save it for the boss, because the boss was a pain in the ass.
[129:13.87]I'm not going to take a hit there.
[129:25.49]This asshole with the blood piss is going to come kill me.
[129:46.07]Please, give me some health.
[129:47.55]Anything.
[129:49.41]Hearts.
[129:50.60]I'll take a heart.
[129:55.56]God, I hate you.
[129:59.94]That is by far the worst enemy I've seen in the whole game so far.
[130:06.19]Without a single doubt in my mind.
[130:13.27]Zorgon, don't push the red button.
[130:18.10]What does that do?
[130:20.02]I'm getting all these cool things, but I keep seeing the Iron Maiden enemy.
[130:26.85]Oh, shit.
[130:35.64]Oh, finally.
[130:36.40]I knew it would be a while before someone came down here, but seriously, I've been forever.
[130:40.26]Anyway, we should get back to the shop.
[130:41.52]It's been closed for way too long.
[130:42.88]You should come by.
[130:44.70]We're on top of the breach.
[130:46.24]You can't miss it.
[130:50.15]Thank you for rescuing Mistress Cadence.
[130:52.69]And this one.
[130:53.85]Okay, so they're good, guys.
[130:54.89]Alright, well, I upgraded the... I got the shop.
[130:58.59]Okay, bye.
[131:09.08]I don't think I have anything for this.
[131:11.78]I'm not even sure what it does.
[131:22.56]Which way should I even go?
[131:24.89]Probably, I'm gonna die at the boss again.
[131:27.65]It's pretty much inevitable at this point.
[131:30.67]Might even die before.
[131:46.43]Where is he?
[131:46.83]Come here, you cube meat boy.
[131:54.04]Listen to me, son.
[131:56.43]I'm your dad.
[131:58.85]Destroy him!
[132:02.09]Emil Ross.
[132:04.39]Emil Ross.
[132:05.01]Emil Ross.
[132:07.59]Welcome, thanks.
[132:08.85]Welcome to the team.
[132:09.88]Welcome to the team.
[132:11.76]Alright, I'm gonna lose again.
[132:13.64]So... This is like a new snake.
[132:15.52]This is like snake rattle and roll.
[132:18.08]I'm your dad!
[132:19.36]Tazine!
[132:23.44]Welcome both of you guys.
[132:24.32]Welcome Tay-Z.
[132:31.11]I got to concentrate because I might be able to beat this guy.
[132:35.89]Nope, I'm dead.
[132:44.18]Welcome the two of yous.
[132:49.12]Yeah, the real bane of my existence are those Iron Maiden enemies that shoot 500 bullets that shoot once, hit the walls, turn around and shoot you again.
[133:00.45]And by the time they shoot you the second time, he's already doing it again.
[133:06.05]I think if you watch this VOD back, besides like the boss encounters, I think that's one of the only times I've actually died in this game, is by that enemy.
[133:19.55]Not died, let's put it this way.
[133:21.03]The reason why I lost was because of those enemies.
[133:28.57]I'll go to the shop after this.
[133:29.43]I want to do one more time, then I'll see the shop.
[133:37.83]Yeah, that's Paul Bearer from WWF.
[133:40.07]That is correct.
[133:46.27]I wish speedrunning this one.
[134:08.87]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[134:19.75]Shop?
[134:20.59]Don't need anything to shop.
[134:23.36]Not yet.
[134:26.50]My ammo condo.
[134:28.68]Yeah, it sucks getting to the boss with like half a heart.
[134:30.90]Especially when you hadn't seen the boss before.
[134:38.97]Especially when you haven't even seen what the guy does.
[134:42.65]Is that just a normal shotgun?
[134:55.62]Ugh.
[134:57.86]It's alright.
[134:58.70]Better than having the default, I guess, right?

[136:17.18]I need a better gun.
[136:29.82]I'm kind of wasting bullets too.
[136:35.89]Is that gonna surprise me?
[136:36.85]That guy just jumped around the corner thinking I was going to be shocked by that.
[136:44.36]Damn it, I thought he was gonna be dead.
[136:47.82]I didn't think he was gonna get it off, but he did.
[136:49.14]Fuck.
[137:03.30]Can't believe that guy got off.
[137:06.08]Hey, it's okay.
[137:08.20]Got my armor back.
[137:14.95]Now might actually be a good time to call it quits and go to the boss.
[137:20.78]Because I'm kind of not seeing anything.
[137:31.56]Anything?
[137:31.96]This better be a room with a ton of cool shit in it.
[137:36.28]Oh, it's a chest.
[137:39.87]Bionic leg.
[137:40.53]More machine than man.
[137:41.79]What does it do?
[137:49.95]Movement speed increased.
[137:54.64]That's good to get early.
[137:57.06]So that's, uh, that's it.
[137:58.56]Let's go fight boss.
[138:01.69]We don't really have very good weapons.
[138:05.25]But whatever.
[138:06.85]Spy suit!
[138:10.05]Welcome back.
[138:13.13]Dos months.
[138:14.26]Thanks for the dos months.
[138:20.36]Skip.
[138:23.87]This is actually a bad place to fight him.
[138:25.39]There's nowhere to hide.
[138:28.79]I wish I could knock this into him.
[138:34.94]I'm falling.
[138:36.18]I'm paying so much attention.
[138:37.40]I was like looking at where the thing was falling.
[138:39.80]That's not smart.
[138:43.08]Oh my god.
[138:46.67]Pressing E. Too many button presses.
[139:08.25]Can I hit him with his own gun?
[139:15.83]Would've been cool.
[139:34.38]Get away from me!
[139:35.36]Don't get that close!
[139:44.53]No, that's not a good idea.
[140:00.18]Die already!
[140:01.02]Die already, you stupid jacked bird!
[140:09.02]Jeez.
[140:11.26]The roll does have iframes.
[140:12.50]It's the first half of the roll.
[140:14.92]So, right there.
[140:16.02]Like, right when you touch the ground, I believe, is when it's over.
[140:22.45]Okay, 47.
[140:22.73]I think it's a little bit better than the shotgun.
[140:25.81]Yeah, I believe right when you're touching the ground, right?
[140:32.37]Or halfway through the air.
[140:38.42]Let's go.
[140:49.49]Heavy weapon crow.
[140:52.61]That's kind of like a heavy weapons crow.
[140:54.11]Who's this dude?
[140:58.74]What is one of my planets doing in this game?
[141:03.66]Greetings.
[141:04.94]What can I do for you?
[141:07.02]Who are you?
[141:08.46]Just a traveling tinker.
[141:09.54]Got stuck here a while back.
[141:10.60]I thought I might fix these elevators to kill some time.
[141:16.26]Elevators only go down one floor at a time right now.
[141:19.34]But with the right equipment, I might be able to configure these to traverse multiple floors.
[141:23.52]Talking shortcuts here, soldier.
[141:26.32]Okay.
[141:27.66]I'm not sure yet.
[141:28.26]It won't be easy, though.
[141:29.04]Whoever engineered this place was crazy.
[141:31.76]Going to head back to the breach for now.
[141:33.06]Speak with me there when you get a chance.
[141:36.83]Okay.
[141:42.11]Oh, look.
[141:42.35]This enemy...
[141:44.79]The one I hate.
[141:45.47]Oh, God.
[141:53.00]Why does he have to do that three times?
[141:54.26]Can't he just do it once?
[141:55.18]Can't he just pulse, like, one?
[141:57.05]One time in every direction?
[141:58.09]Does he have to pulse three?
[141:59.95]Fucking get out of here with this guy!
[142:03.25]Why don't you keep stop giving him to me?
[142:13.95]I hate that enemy.
[142:21.20]You guys are freaking me out.
[142:29.27]I don't know what to do.
[142:49.73]Moose and Mills.
[142:53.81]Moose and Mills.
[142:54.88]Welcome back.
[142:55.36]Thanks, dude.
[142:57.32]Much appreciated.
[142:58.10]Thank you for your more than one time subscription.
[143:10.13]What did I say?
[143:10.61]I don't get it, this game?
[143:13.41]Say what?
[143:14.19]Fuck.
[143:18.72]Oh, I don't know about this one.
[143:23.18]Where's the exit?
[143:26.80]Fuck.
[143:28.07]This is such a stupid idea for me to be in here when I don't know how this whole room works yet.
[143:32.97]Like, what a dumb idea.
[143:33.83]Why did I even come in here for?
[143:39.45]Son of a bitch.
[143:42.92]And I can't even go up there.
[143:47.84]Can I... I'll get me out of this room.
[143:54.81]Just stop teleporting out.
[143:55.69]Bye.
[143:57.47]I don't care.
[143:58.93]I'm not going to lose all my health in this stupid Indiana Jones room.
[144:09.90]Fucking hate that enemy.
[144:12.84]Delete that fucking enemy from this game.
[144:14.48]I hate it.
[144:34.90]It's the sun.
[144:36.84]I have a lot of money.
[144:39.22]Please let me purchase things from you.
[144:44.48]What's this, like, joke cartoon gun?
[144:46.94]I'm gonna buy it.
[144:47.53]I want it.
[144:50.73]Alright.
[144:51.43]I bought, like, the cartoon Looney Tunes gun.
[144:55.37]I can't wait.
[144:56.85]I can't wait to shoot Donald Duck in the face with this and have his whole face turn black and his bill goes around to the back of his head.
[145:07.84]uh another person up here is this the other shop lady uh what is going on here what's the thing in the top right um hi break the targets win a prize they call me winchester and for you I have a simple game of skill would you like to know the rules sure
[145:36.02]To play this game, you have to break the targets in a certain number of shots.
[145:40.00]Each shot will ricochet a few times, but if you break more targets, you get a better reward.
[145:46.99]Not today, buddy.
[145:49.21]I don't... No, not today.
[145:52.15]I need to fight the second boss and win, so not today.
[146:03.34]I'm okay on health.
[146:07.01]Let's give this a test.
[146:10.81]How do I shoot this fucking thing?
[146:16.67]So it just launches out bombs.
[146:23.20]Alright.
[146:24.92]I'll give it a test.
[146:26.48]Might be good for bosses.
[146:32.63]Pretty damn good.
[146:35.50]Yeah, oh yeah.
[146:36.80]Oh yeah.
[146:40.86]Oh yeah.
[146:43.30]I like that one.
[146:46.42]Oh yeah, I like that one.
[146:49.65]That's a... That's kind of a good one.
[146:58.37]I actually didn't mean to do that.
[147:00.59]I don't know why I pressed space.
[147:09.03]I might as well take it.
[147:11.81]Sure, I'll take it for this gun.
[147:20.08]Forgotten bullet who laid down his offering gun at the altar.
[147:23.82]Yeah, I'll offer him the shotgun.
[147:26.12]Take the shotgun!
[147:29.30]Live to gun another day at peace.
[147:31.18]I don't know what that means.
[147:37.48]Is that just full health or something?
[147:39.76]Or do I get extra life?
[147:50.63]Go around the room.
[147:51.55]I will spin around.
[147:53.75]Oh no, watch out for the ghost gun.
[147:56.31]Watch out for the ghost gun.
[148:03.21]Yikes.
[148:05.11]Could roll a grenade in there, but... That tracking.
[148:10.32]It wasn't even pointed at me.
[148:21.11]I really just want to get to the boss.
[148:47.30]Don't you do it.
[148:50.84]I like how the enemies are bullets.
[148:51.90]It's very charming.
[148:53.94]What a charming game.
[148:58.24]I've actually not been paying attention to the walls.
[149:02.56]Because there's lots to do with the wall, right?
[149:13.41]Lots to do with the wall.
[149:24.50]It's getting kind of heavy.
[149:30.64]I can buy a key.
[149:34.64]Hello.
[149:35.80]I'll take one key, please.
[149:38.58]And give me that too.
[149:40.24]Bye.
[149:43.68]Bye.
[149:44.34]I have to go around.
[149:51.82]What's in the box?
[149:52.34]What's in the box?
[149:52.84]What's in the box?
[149:54.16]A Earth ring.
[149:56.44]Some floors are familiar.
[150:01.56]Sure.
[150:08.83]Is that Marceline from Adventure Time?
[150:15.43]That's the right character I'm thinking of, right?
[150:22.07]Is Marsali, whatever her name is?
[150:25.63]Who's the Bubblegum Princess?
[150:28.53]Princess Bubblegum.
[150:30.85]Flame Princess, right?
[150:36.71]Last place to check for the boss room.
[150:39.75]Go, go, go.
[150:42.04]Found it.
[150:43.92]Anything else I can do?
[150:46.14]I don't know.
[150:46.72]I'm not doing this.
[150:47.52]I'm not doing this.
[150:49.86]Give me my funny gun.
[150:52.68]This is a new boss.
[150:59.51]The B-Holster.
[151:12.08]Jesus, I didn't want to dodge that way.
[151:15.28]Alright, that's enough of that gun.
[151:16.58]Oh my god, I didn't even see that.
[151:28.23]I get little buddies when I'm good.
[151:40.30]Your little friends are fucking annoying.
[151:46.74]Kill the adds, kill the adds!
[151:58.56]Come on!
[152:00.30]Had to be perfectly placed right there.
[152:02.50]I'm gonna die.
[152:07.76]Oh, all these boss variations.
[152:12.10]I've seen a different boss every time I've gone in this room.
[152:16.44]Can I just get the same boss like two times in a row so I can know how to fight it?
[152:20.67]So I don't lose immediately?
[152:34.34]First it was like the Medusa lady.
[152:36.80]Then it was that guy.
[152:38.58]Hold on, I'm like on tilt right now.
[152:40.34]I'm gonna go back.
[152:48.95]What do you do?
[152:50.73]Might as well try all the characters, right?
[153:00.84]Hi.
[153:08.24]Is this the minigame guy?
[153:12.22]Actual stream puke.
[153:21.77]Which room is the... Is it up here?
[153:24.19]Hunter Timothy 32.
[153:26.73]Hunter Timothy.
[153:28.07]Thanks a lot.
[153:30.15]Welcome.
[153:39.17]So, is this where you get permanent upgrades?
[153:41.71]Is that what I understand here?
[153:44.77]Dungeon Acquisition Department.
[153:46.01]You can donate, blah, and we'll order new guns and items for the collection.
[153:51.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[153:54.64]Okay.
[153:59.08]Interesting.
[154:04.22]Once they're ordered, you can find the new stuff down in the chambers.
[154:07.14]So, this is how you unlock weapons.
[154:09.33]Does a big dude do anything different?
[154:18.54]Thompson submachine gun.
[154:20.08]Heart bottle.
[154:25.98]Rocket powered bullets.
[154:27.34]Let's get those.
[154:28.16]I feel like heart bottle might be kind of good.
[154:35.07]Get a Thompson.
[154:37.47]Gamma ray.
[154:42.23]I'm going to take a look at some stuff.
[154:45.21]Rocket-powered bullets have joined.
[154:46.51]Heart bottle has joined.
[154:48.73]Yep, yep.
[154:51.45]Okay, let's take a closer look.
[154:56.84]Where is it?
[155:02.34]Where is it?
[155:04.68]Okay, I do have to actually pick it up before I can look at it.
[155:07.46]Probably.
[155:09.20]That would make sense.
[155:12.90]friendship cookie?
[155:16.20]Seems like a lot of stuff in the game.
[155:18.94]Gamma Ray sucks?
[155:20.04]Oh, well.
[155:31.77]Do I have the microtransaction gun?
[155:33.91]I don't think that's a thing.
[155:39.30]Standard pistol.
[155:42.03]And a crossbow.
[155:46.16]Single shot.
[155:49.64]And I got this little dog.
[155:51.58]What does the dog do?
[156:05.51]Hey, nope him.
[156:08.19]Thanks for summoning.
[156:09.09]Nope M8.
[156:14.59]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[156:17.77]Hope you're enjoying sick me.
[156:22.05]Can you tell I'm sick, guys?
[156:23.62]Oh, I'm sick.
[156:24.16]Can you tell?
[156:36.32]Crossbow's actually kind of fun.
[156:40.52]Secret room.
[156:43.30]If you can aim, I can actually land shots.
[156:47.10]That would sure be... What does the dog even do?
[156:50.06]Oh, shit.
[156:50.42]Watch out for the March Simpsons.
[156:51.46]These are the strongest enemies in the game.
[157:07.27]He just phased through that.
[157:08.73]Come on, man.
[157:20.10]Bring a little actual little pistol pistol.
[157:33.31]Get outta here.
[157:35.79]Will you just get outta here?
[157:44.27]Don't like this room.
[157:45.23]Too small.
[157:49.36]Probably should look at the character description to see what this dog actually is supposed to do.
[157:52.71]Does he pick up items or something?
[157:56.60]Does he sniff walls?
[158:03.07]Is this dog a wall sniffer?
[158:29.77]Apparently not aiming in the right spot.
[158:47.86]Watch out for the magician.
[158:49.96]Here comes more.
[158:51.36]Here comes Marge Simpson.
[158:54.68]I shouldn't have got hit by that, but she spawned right next to me.
[158:56.92]I could have ran away, but I didn't.
[158:58.18]I just went for an angry Marge Simpson.
[159:12.13]Yikes.
[159:21.00]I really do need to do some sensitivity stuff here next time I play.
[159:26.50]Drop my mouse DPI or something, because it is kind of a little too much for me.
[159:34.81]Just a little bit.
[159:40.37]I guess I'm going to buy this.
[159:44.58]Do not test it.
[159:45.52]I wish there was a spot over here, like a training dummy or something.
[159:49.80]So this guy didn't freak out every time you used a weapon.
[160:07.32]Let's just go.
[160:09.37]I don't care.
[160:09.95]Does the game have co-op?
[160:14.19]I actually don't know.
[160:15.05]I think it does have co-op.
[160:16.59]Does it local?
[160:17.99]Or... I don't think it's online.
[160:23.52]I just blew that guy away.
[160:32.26]Shit.
[160:33.63]Too many things to have to press.
[160:37.97]Alright, I don't like the blunderbuss for this.
[160:39.79]Anything we have to charge, I don't like at all.
[160:44.51]You kind of have to have like five buttons being pressed.
[160:46.89]I don't even need to use it.
[161:23.91]Or the fire, or the grease, whatever the hell it is.
[161:41.34]Damn it!
[161:42.82]This dog's a little too far.
[161:58.37]Finally.
[161:59.81]These weapons kind of suck.
[162:04.74]I'm going to go donate this weapon to the fucking creepy guy in the well.
[162:11.48]Gamma ray.
[162:13.49]Oh, I just unlocked this.
[162:17.15]Somebody was saying this thing sucks.
[162:19.13]We'll find out.
[162:28.55]What a new beat boss first try.
[162:30.33]Yeah, this game doesn't mess around.
[162:43.04]That is something I have come to realize.
[162:44.92]Hey, this game doesn't hold your hand.
[162:48.45]You know what I mean?
[162:49.35]There's no hand holding.
[162:57.32]Poison?
[162:59.14]Seems to be.
[162:59.66]I actually kind of like it.
[163:09.40]It's fun.
[163:11.26]It's fun to gamma ray people.
[163:14.04]What do I need?
[163:23.02]Don't forget to meet the elevator guy.
[163:24.19]Yeah, where is he?
[163:25.17]Is he back there?
[163:31.89]Is he just in this floor somewhere?
[163:33.51]Like on the floor?
[163:39.92]Push them off.
[163:42.08]See ya.
[163:43.02]Come on.
[163:43.44]Get him in there.
[163:59.41]I hope one of those stupid iron maidens don't spawn.
[164:04.38]So y'all know how much I love those things.
[164:08.32]Lucky you don't have to reload this.
[164:20.25]Ghost!
[164:30.46]Okie dokie.
[164:31.47]I don't have enough money.
[164:32.25]Definitely have no money for anything.
[164:54.18]Holy shit, die.
[164:55.74]Die.
[164:56.70]Why won't you die?
[164:57.58]That lasted a very long time.
[165:06.22]Where are you going?
[165:09.36]Down?
[165:09.76]Up?
[165:10.00]Up?
[165:10.14]Down?
[165:10.40]I'm running out of ammo.
[165:19.35]I need to find some...
[165:23.03]Okay.
[165:23.83]Oh my fucking god, are you serious?
[165:25.88]Where am I?
[165:29.46]How was I supposed to know that was going to happen?
[165:30.82]I've never even seen these platforms before.
[165:33.22]Bye.
[165:37.06]Don't care.
[165:39.79]I've never even touched those, so I didn't know that could even...
[165:57.18]God, I can't really dodge.
[165:59.16]Too many places to fall.
[166:13.62]More?
[166:15.12]More?
[166:16.40]Maybe.
[166:20.04]Can't really save enough money to buy something.
[166:28.62]I hope.
[166:32.26]If I could buy a heart, that would be great.
[166:37.72]Well, no heart, but armor.
[166:41.72]Which is this 24?
[166:42.82]I mean, armor is probably better, right?
[166:47.78]It's like that blocks a full hit.
[166:52.14]I have ammo and other guns.
[166:56.53]Just gonna have to deal with it.
[167:01.88]Gonna have to deal with it.
[167:17.86]Get out of here.
[167:20.50]That just came out so fast.
[167:21.92]Look, it's still coming after me.
[167:23.78]There's another one in here.
[167:26.10]I gotta get something.
[167:27.00]I gotta do something.
[167:29.18]There's another one down here.
[167:30.50]And there's a ton of other people in this room.
[167:33.44]Who the hell's even here?
[167:39.45]Where's my point of entry here?
[167:46.42]Come here, you stupid son.
[167:47.86]There's more people.
[168:08.87]Is that it?
[168:13.37]I think that's it.
[168:29.22]God damn it!
[168:31.18]Fuck you!
[168:31.84]I don't even care.
[168:38.39]I don't even care.
[168:38.89]Just get me away from that fucking guy.
[168:54.30]I have such bad guns.
[168:55.64]This gun sucks.
[169:08.17]This gun is so slow and so inaccurate, it doesn't kill anything.
[169:18.49]I only have one heart for the boss.
[169:21.11]What a fucking surprise, huh?
[169:31.46]Where's the key?
[169:36.26]And did I miss any chests?
[169:43.53]No, I'm gonna go back and heal though.
[169:44.83]I could buy some hearts.
[169:49.24]What is that?
[169:50.95]A dungeon eagle?
[169:51.91]Let's hope it's good.
[170:01.41]I don't get mad at this game.
[170:03.31]No, I only get mad at the one enemy.
[170:05.03]That one enemy is the worst thing in this whole game.
[170:09.35]It's the only thing I get... Have you heard me get upset about anything else besides the stupid Iron Maiden spam the room with bullets, turn around, shoot you again with the same bullets enemy?
[170:17.45]No.
[170:18.62]It's the only thing I've been upset about.
[170:21.48]Uh-oh.
[170:31.24]Uh... I don't wanna... It's probably gonna, like, take one of my... It's gonna hurt me or something.
[170:35.52]I'm not gonna do that right now.
[170:40.30]Okay, that guy's destroyed.
[170:46.73]Anything in this room that I need to be aware of?
[170:52.34]Oh, you trade in your guns?
[170:55.36]The gun muncher?
[170:57.80]Alright, well, munch on this fucking piece of shit.
[171:06.35]What did that do?
[171:09.87]Somebody told me this was the gun muncher.
[171:13.18]It's not the gun muncher.
[171:15.87]What did I just do to myself?
[171:16.93]Are you talking about here?
[171:25.25]Well, I look over chat, it says everyone's saying trade your guns to the gun guy.
[171:32.66]I don't want to feed him that.
[171:36.96]I want to feed him this.
[171:44.12]Feed him the gun muncher.
[171:48.01]Uh, take... Take this thing.
[171:50.44]I don't... This thing's not that great.
[171:51.82]I don't like it.
[171:58.08]That's gonna spawn more Iron Maidens.
[171:59.70]Are you kidding me?
[172:01.03]Please tell me that's not true.
[172:05.49]Winchester Rifle?
[172:08.97]Well... Oh, well...
[172:14.37]There's only one place I haven't gone.
[172:16.93]It's up there or here.
[172:18.41]To the right.
[172:29.60]Up this way.
[172:35.20]This could be good.
[172:42.87]Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda.
[172:44.53]Oh, my dog's... Oh, Jesus.
[172:48.22]I guess he's okay.
[172:49.44]He's alright.
[172:52.12]I think he's okay.
[172:54.76]Well, I'm probably gonna lose.
[172:57.62]Unless it's the snake guy.
[173:03.75]Ammo condo.
[173:04.49]Let's try this again.
[173:23.45]What am I getting stuck on?
[173:25.11]What the fuck is that thing?
[173:33.89]I'm not gonna lose.
[173:38.75]Yep, I'm dead.
[173:40.86]Alright, I'm gonna give it one more attempt, and then I'm gonna move on.
[173:52.16]I wanna work on a video.
[174:00.53]R.I.P.
[174:00.93]Jerry, that's right.
[174:02.49]I got headshot.
[174:22.13]Whoa, give me the gun.
[174:45.29]I just don't like using that gun.
[174:48.59]I'd rather just be able to aim and go click, click, click, click, click.
[175:10.08]Give a very vague hint about the video you're making.
[175:13.30]Patch notes.
[175:15.83]It's definitely not what you think either.
[175:18.44]Patch notes.
[175:21.26]Going over some patch notes.
[175:26.67]It's the only hit you're going to get.
[175:28.27]It's not going to be out for a few days because there's a lot of work that needs to get done.
[175:35.61]No, it is not an Overwatch video.
[175:47.38]You seriously didn't die.
[175:48.58]You were right in my fucking face.
[175:53.24]The League of Legends.
[175:55.42]We'll see.
[175:57.14]It's not going to be up probably, like, maybe three or four days.
[176:00.72]Depends on the thing that I need when it comes in.
[176:03.16]Because I do need things.
[176:07.06]Listen to me, son!
[176:13.86]I'm your dad!
[176:20.71]Destroy him!
[176:22.35]Whoa!
[176:22.89]Mekker 117, 117.
[176:23.83]Bomb, used for boom.
[176:24.93]Okay.
[176:27.31]Welcome, thanks a sub.
[176:31.95]Thank you so much for taking a $5 bill and inserting it into the soda machine.
[176:37.96]You know the thing that goes like... What would you like to drink?
[176:47.55]I mean, you put the $5 in, what would you like to drink?
[176:51.08]Would you like a Sprite?
[176:52.86]Fanta?
[176:55.22]Or a good old-fashioned... Come on, what's he going to say, guys?
[176:57.82]What's the quote?
[176:59.04]Come on.
[177:00.60]Come on, I want to see it in the chat.
[177:04.40]What is it?
[177:04.98]Come on.
[177:16.87]Oh yeah, there it is.
[177:18.21]Dr. Pepper.
[177:19.13]Remember when that was a thing that I used to do?
[177:24.09]What a dumb thing.
[177:26.51]Oh, I drink Dr. Pepper!
[177:29.09]What a fucking idiot.
[177:32.23]Hey guys, welcome to Gerber985.
[177:34.12]One of my things is I drink Dr. Pepper.
[177:39.74]Why is that a joke?
[177:50.13]Didn't I, like, drink a Dr. Pepper really fast and throw up on stream or something and I highlighted it?
[177:54.47]I forget.
[177:54.97]Something like that.
[178:08.42]Mr. Pibb.
[178:11.92]I don't really drink a whole lot of soda anymore.
[178:13.32]Not anymore.
[178:20.20]I was on a real big kick for it for a while, but I got over it.
[178:25.30]You need that VOD?
[178:26.06]It's on my YouTube channel somewhere.
[178:27.38]But don't I, I like piss my pants or something, don't I?
[178:32.43]What happens in that like pepper, Dr. Pepper chug thing?
[178:36.87]Do I piss my pants?
[178:37.67]What do we got?
[178:46.86]Do I have any money?
[178:47.76]I have 45.
[179:02.25]Dr. Pfeffer.
[179:05.06]Dr. Pfeffer.
[179:07.48]Look, I didn't get sued.
[179:09.60]What is this?
[179:10.64]A shrine to an old Gunslinger.
[179:11.90]There's an inscription.
[179:12.71]Kill your past.
[179:13.45]You've already damned your future.
[179:14.61]The rest is worn away.
[179:18.73]Okay.
[179:22.94]Aww.
[179:25.03]I thought for some reason that might have worked.
[179:26.45]I was going to throw the bomb down the well.
[179:28.95]He's going to wake up and be like, You dare disturb my slumber.
[179:34.18]You are ingratable.
[179:39.08]What do you got?
[179:40.52]At the shop.
[179:41.92]You pooped your pants?
[179:43.76]No, I drank a bunch of Dr. Pepper and I pissed my pants.
[179:47.82]Something like that.
[179:48.46]I don't remember.
[179:49.40]Somebody will.
[179:53.06]How much are these?
[179:53.60]20.
[179:54.26]Eh, give me another one.
[179:55.82]Why not?
[179:58.95]Okay.
[179:59.87]Let's go kill a boss.
[180:05.47]It's the bird again.
[180:06.57]I don't shit with my pants on.
[180:23.27]I never said that.
[180:25.37]I said I warm the seat up first.
[180:30.63]Alright, hold on.
[180:31.29]I gotta stop, like, talking.
[180:32.31]Fuck.
[180:44.64]I'm gonna scroll.
[180:45.38]What am I doing?
[180:45.84]I can, like, hold control.
[180:47.06]I'll stay.
[180:47.48]Why not?
[181:01.03]He does a melee move too?
[181:04.33]Interesting.
[181:07.75]I'd really like for him to get out of the way there.
[181:31.15]ammo for this thing.
[181:36.70]And... Wow, why did my game just froze?
[181:43.70]What was up with that?
[181:46.09]Game froze, but control is broken.
[182:00.48]There we go.
[182:01.12]That actually hit me.
[182:19.54]Apparently it did.
[182:26.36]Please hurt him!
[182:27.86]Kill him!
[182:29.94]I feel like it takes a fucking eternity.
[182:36.90]Please, give me the cowboy belt.
[182:38.62]I need more damaging weapons.
[182:45.15]I don't have enough.
[183:00.33]Enemies sure have a lot of health in this game.
[183:03.15]I'm not sure if that's necessarily the case.
[183:06.25]Just some weapons, I think, just take forever to kill anybody.
[183:15.36]My lord.
[183:27.86]You want to snipe me?
[183:28.74]You want to snipe me?
[183:29.36]Is that what you want to do?
[183:30.08]Oh, you're not going to hit me.
[183:30.92]You're going to miss.
[183:35.33]Forgot some money?
[183:35.97]Oh, whatever.
[183:36.75]You don't need money.
[183:39.87]It's not all about the money, guys.
[183:45.02]It's not all about the money.
[183:51.90]It's about staying as far away from this asshole as possible.
[184:01.22]You don't eat shit.
[184:07.39]There's more people here.
[184:11.11]Full of love, of all that is sacred.

[186:29.06]Is it going to kill me?
[186:33.85]That's going to kill me.
[186:39.05]I've seen like three people say that now.
[186:42.63]If I jump down this, I'm just going to die.
