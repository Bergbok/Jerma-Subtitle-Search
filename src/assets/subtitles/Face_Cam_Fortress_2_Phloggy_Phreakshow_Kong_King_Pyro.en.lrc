[00:08.67]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.53]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, Saturday's edition.
[00:14.19]Four people on the point right now.
[00:15.59]We're gonna take care of that right now.
[00:18.54]Oh!
[00:19.24]Did that hit anybody?
[00:20.70]Apparently not.
[00:22.52]Come on, get lit!
[00:24.07]Playing as the Pyro, with the Scorch Shot, as you can see on screen.
[00:28.44]The Flowgistinator, Flowgeistinator, however you want to pronounce that freaky weapon.
[00:34.54]And the Neon Annihilator.
[00:36.08]Trying to get a little interesting setup going here.
[00:39.64]Whoa, whoa, whoa, Willag, what the hell was that?
[00:42.51]Trying to get an interesting setup.
[00:43.79]I'll explain it in a second, once I have a second here.
[00:46.03]Oh, come here!
[00:49.71]Mmm!
[00:50.79]Oh!
[00:51.61]Oh, Flog!
[00:52.95]Oh!
[00:53.94]Where are they?
[00:54.40]Where are they?
[00:55.60]Where are these rat bastards?
[01:00.08]Sneak attack, baby.
[01:01.54]Oh boy!
[01:03.00]Maybe not.
[01:04.90]Oh, crits!
[01:11.34]Hey, how you doing?
[01:14.04]Oh my god, it's chaos.
[01:16.00]This is absolute chaos.
[01:18.92]Oh my god.
[01:20.88]Oh my god.
[01:23.39]Dude, dude.
[01:27.03]This is chaos.
[01:28.93]I just killed like nine people.
[01:33.53]Okay, so let me... Oh, heal me, please.
[01:37.44]Let me try and explain what I was trying to say in the very beginning.
[01:43.17]Oh my god!
[01:44.05]This weapon is such a goofy weapon!
[01:47.89]I always forget.
[01:49.49]Come here!
[01:51.69]Oh, get crit!
[01:53.92]Well, that was... absolutely insane.
[01:58.58]Let's do this.
[02:00.92]So, what I wanted to talk about in this video has to do with the Scorch Shot and the Flow Gistinator.
[02:06.85]And that guy... Whoa, I just, like, freaked myself out right there.
[02:10.35]And it has to do with the combination of these two items and how they can be very, very good when used together.
[02:16.06]Now, that can be said about the Detonator as well, but I feel like with the Detonator...
[02:20.58]You do more damage, but you still have to detonate it.
[02:23.10]And I'm one of those people that I like all the stuff done for me.
[02:27.69]So it's detonating it by itself when you knock into somebody, or when you hit a ground, and plus it knocks people away too.
[02:33.21]And I was a very, very big advocate of somebody that was against this item when it released, and I'm starting to have second thoughts about it.
[02:41.27]I think this could really be an interesting item when you use it in the right situations.
[02:45.77]but we are back here now at their spawn and let's see if we can't be a real real bastard here so you know what this they're all out there I might as well just go to this no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna hang out here let's go up to where they all oh my god
[03:04.18]Come to papa!
[03:05.64]Woohoo!
[03:15.44]That's the music I want playing when I have the plug-estimator up.
[03:20.70]When I do the crits, that's the song I want playing.
[03:23.95]If only I had custom songs.
[03:30.58]Alright, get on that point.
[03:31.38]We're already on it.
[03:33.02]Oh, they got a sentry!
[03:35.08]That's not cool!
[03:36.90]That is not cool, man.
[03:38.97]Click, click, click, click, click!
[03:41.93]Boom!
[03:43.79]Boom!
[03:45.13]I love the sound this thing makes, too.
[03:46.33]It's so awesome.
[03:47.35]Also using the Neon Annihilator.
[03:49.61]I almost said Lionator.
[03:51.69]Been watching too much Game of Thrones.
[03:53.39]He's a lion.
[03:54.41]He's a Lannister.
[03:56.64]Ooh!
[03:57.24]That was a pretty sweet shot.
[04:01.72]Just defend the point.
[04:03.38]Keep the point defended until King Kong and Godzilla come have like an epic battle.
[04:09.40]Come here.
[04:11.13]Yeah, you can blast me around all you want.
[04:12.79]It's still going to be a firefight, bro.
[04:17.83]Damn.
[04:19.59]Damn.
[04:20.45]Not good.
[04:21.03]Not good.
[04:22.57]Where are you going, man?
[04:24.05]Pyro versus Pyro.
[04:24.95]Come on.
[04:25.17]That's what it's all about.
[04:27.76]I gotta get that hit.
[04:29.30]I gotta hit somebody with this.
[04:31.16]Damn, come on!
[04:32.06]I gotta get somebody to live with this thing.
[04:35.32]Oh my god, why can I not hit anybody?
[04:37.10]I don't know where the health packs are.
[04:40.09]Oh, you son of a... I was going to light that guy on fire from behind, activate my crits while he activated his crits.
[04:48.97]Man, that was gonna be crit-ception.
[04:51.57]It just didn't happen.
[04:53.57]Damn.
[04:55.71]It's alright.
[04:59.58]They're gonna win.
[05:01.02]Just run.
[05:01.42]Just barrel right through.
[05:02.75]Oh, this guy had the same idea.
[05:03.83]I need medic.
[05:06.17]I need a medic.
[05:08.93]Where you going?
[05:10.59]What?
[05:13.99]I thought that was a spy that backstabbed me.
[05:15.98]I got, like, launched.
[05:17.42]Wow.
[05:18.56]Good show, bro.
[05:19.50]Good show.
[05:22.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:24.28]Come on, King Kong.
[05:26.16]I want to activate my King Kong powers and have them drop from the ceiling.
[05:29.36]Why am I looking at my actual ceiling?
[05:31.82]Instead of looking up like this, I looked over at my actual ceiling when I said that.
[05:36.33]Let me get an overheal.
[05:38.43]Alright, they can't just take this from us like this.
[05:42.19]Time to activate the Flog Rage.
[05:48.90]Rage.
[05:49.82]We got it.
[05:53.60]Damn.
[05:54.24]I gotta hit him.
[05:56.16]Oh my god.
[05:57.44]I can't even airblast that either.
[05:58.72]I gotta work on my skill here.
[06:03.16]Finally.
[06:05.16]There we go.
[06:06.06]Knock him around.
[06:07.34]Yeah, now he's gonna run.
[06:08.02]He's gonna think I'm gonna chase him.
[06:09.26]I'm not.
[06:11.20]This is so stupid.
[06:18.32]Oh my god.
[06:18.70]I'm gonna run out of bullets.
[06:22.96]Okay, now I have to... Okay, come on.
[06:24.65]Come on.
[06:25.07]Come on.
[06:27.85]Did he just blow himself up?
[06:30.27]I think he just blew himself up.
[06:33.23]Oh, crits!
[06:34.71]Crits everywhere.
[06:35.52]I'm holding down the button.
[06:36.30]I don't even know where anybody is.
[06:37.88]Come here!
[06:38.84]Dude, this is ridiculous.
[06:41.96]I love this.
[06:42.92]It's so goofy.
[06:45.10]Come on, we gotta hold him.
[06:46.12]We gotta hold him.
[06:46.69]This guy won't die.
[06:51.06]Uh-oh!
[06:51.42]Somebody on it!
[06:51.94]Somebody on it!
[06:53.22]Knock him off.
[06:55.94]This is it.
[06:56.88]Oh my god, this is gonna come down to the wire.
[06:59.18]Oh!
[07:00.59]Oh!
[07:00.75]Oh no!
[07:04.35]Oh, this is bad!
[07:06.49]Get him off!
[07:09.81]Oh... Good game.
[07:12.71]Good font game, guys.
[07:15.30]I'll take that loss.
[07:16.18]That was a close game.
[07:17.36]Overtime, overtime.
[07:19.14]Holy crap.
[07:20.56]Let's do another one.
[07:22.12]Nobody, nobody.
[07:25.55]Engineer on here would be really fun.
[07:28.03]Whoa, my god!
[07:28.91]Where did that guy come from?
[07:30.79]That guy just like launched out of nowhere.
[07:35.09]Oh, no, this is bad.
[07:36.49]Oh, this is bad.
[07:38.25]Get one of them.
[07:39.17]Get this other guy too.
[07:41.68]Did you see that medic though?
[07:42.67]That was crazy.
[07:43.81]That medic just like, appeared right in front of my face.
[07:46.99]He must have jumped down from the balcony.
[07:51.03]Respawn.
[07:55.25]Man, my whole body hurts right now.
[07:56.76]Every time I move my arms, my whole body hurts.
[08:00.58]Because I was at the gym.
[08:02.50]And I went- Oh my god, I'm gonna get beat right here.
[08:05.24]Oh, nice shot.
[08:07.01]That was like a little pellet shot.
[08:09.23]But anyways, yeah, whenever I do this, I got back to the gym.
[08:12.79]And if you remember old, old, old Jerma channel, I used to go to the gym all the time.
[08:17.12]I used to go to the gym literally... We were getting spawn camped.
[08:19.66]Literally every day I would go to the gym.
[08:22.10]And I...
[08:23.41]That hasn't been happening lately.
[08:24.85]I've been going to the gym, like, once every, like, three months.
[08:29.23]And I really want to change that.
[08:31.43]So I went back the other day.
[08:32.52]And if you don't go to the gym for a while after going for a long time... Every... Why am I not... What was just going on right there?
[08:41.29]I was holding it on their backs.
[08:45.24]My ping is... 11.
[08:48.12]What?
[08:49.90]But anyways, when you go to the gym, if you haven't gone for a long time, your whole body hurts.
[08:55.45]I did curls, and I seriously feel like I want to die right now.
[08:59.93]Let me get some heals, man.
[09:00.81]Let me get some of those.
[09:01.43]Let me get some of those beautiful heals.
[09:04.89]Whoa!
[09:06.11]Please heal me!
[09:07.19]Oh my god, heal me!
[09:08.51]Oh my god, man!
[09:10.26]Oh my god, I'm stuck right here.
[09:12.22]I need to get like one hit on somebody.
[09:14.90]Jeez.
[09:16.74]There it is!
[09:17.54]There it is!
[09:18.88]That's what I wanted!
[09:19.42]Get rid of this!
[09:22.08]Oh, yeah!
[09:24.49]That was beautiful.
[09:26.39]That was so lucky, man.
[09:27.49]I can't believe I did not die from that.
[09:29.25]Same with that.
[09:29.83]I should have bled to death right there.
[09:32.71]No, this is where we go down.
[09:39.28]So much stress.
[09:41.12]Hi, how you doing?
[09:42.02]My name is Jerma.
[09:42.74]What's your name?
[09:43.48]Oh, God.
[09:47.85]Night of Purgatory.
[09:50.53]Interesting name.
[09:52.37]Very interesting.
[09:55.49]Dr. Pepper.
[09:59.63]Dr. Pepper.
[10:02.22]Oh, you make the world taste better.
[10:04.88]Remember that jingle?
[10:08.42]30 seconds, we're gonna lose.
[10:10.52]Come on, guys.
[10:11.86]I have faith.
[10:13.40]The Phlogistinator has faith.
[10:16.20]Damn.
[10:17.04]Oh, he's...
[10:21.16]Alright, 15 seconds.
[10:21.74]I gotta change to something else.
[10:23.53]What, before Pyro's?
[10:25.85]Uh... Soldier.
[10:27.61]Soldier with... Whatever, that's fine.
[10:29.47]I'm just gonna, like, rocket jump over there.
[10:33.41]Come on.
[10:33.69]Oh, we're gonna get it.
[10:35.17]Teleporter, where's it gonna take me?
[10:37.31]Come on!
[10:38.83]There we go.
[10:40.45]Get me over there.
[10:42.35]Well, that was a bad rocket jump.
[10:44.01]And so was that.
[10:44.55]What, did I hit the ceiling?
[10:46.47]Oh, god.
[10:47.71]Fantastic.
[10:50.90]Just gotta... Ah, get him off.
[10:57.44]Covenant pee!
[11:02.76]Why am I doing that?
[11:03.53]I should've just shoot him.
[11:06.77]Oh, they have a sentry too.
[11:09.89]You know, back to Pyro.
[11:11.05]No, stay Soldier.
[11:12.85]I don't know what to do.
[11:13.85]I'm so scared right now because they only have one second.
[11:18.05]No, I'm staying Soldier.
[11:19.92]I'm going to stay soldier right now.
[11:23.94]Level one, not worth the wait, they have one second.
[11:30.28]Get me over there.
[11:32.50]Hey, hello, Mr. Spy.
[11:34.22]Hello.
[11:39.85]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:42.39]Wow, he could have just won that.
[11:44.81]I fell down the stairs.
[11:47.89]Oh, man, maybe I should have, like, not clicked.
[11:49.95]Oh, god, no.
[11:51.37]This is bad.
[11:51.93]Scout.
[11:52.75]Scout.
[11:53.77]I'm just, like, being an idiot with the soldier right now.
[11:55.95]Let's just regular scattergun guillotine.
[12:01.34]I didn't, like, relax.
[12:02.56]I'm going crazy.
[12:03.40]I'm just so scared of that one second.
[12:07.40]We're okay now.
[12:09.29]We're okay now.
[12:09.93]Let's see if I can guillotine some mother effer.
[12:16.10]Whoa.
[12:17.65]Sister.
[12:19.13]Lag.
[12:22.33]Just hit that into a wall, apparently.
[12:24.55]Hmm.
[12:31.45]Two scouts.
[12:32.13]Two scouts.
[12:33.95]Oh.
[12:34.11]Oh, what do we got?
[12:38.67]What do we got?
[12:42.23]Oh, you son of a... You son of a...
[12:48.17]Anyway, I'm not really doing a whole lot, but my team is really pulling through right here.
[12:53.97]Maybe I could even go back to Pyro.
[12:55.21]No, there's going to be five Pyros on the team if I do that.
[12:58.39]We'll stick with this.
[13:00.76]We'll stick with this for the last 30 seconds.
[13:02.54]Why not?
[13:08.04]Let me just scoop somebody up with this.
[13:09.64]Come on.
[13:12.38]Uh...
[13:17.30]And... Nope.
[13:18.60]Shoot him in his face.
[13:24.96]Oh my god.
[13:27.45]So, the last, like, two and a half minutes, I think I've killed one person.
[13:31.73]And I've just been, like, jumping around like a freak.
[13:34.91]Hey, whatever works, right?
[13:36.21]I think that's gonna be it.
[13:37.85]Hey, we did it.
[13:39.82]Ghostbuster.
[13:42.21]Third place as the Scout, except that didn't really happen at all.
[13:45.39]But yeah, that's going to wrap things up, guys.
[13:47.07]Thank you so much for watching.
[13:48.03]I really do appreciate it.
[13:49.48]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[13:51.34]And of course, take care, everybody.
[13:54.78]This is going to grow from here to here.
[13:57.16]That's a lie.
[13:57.68]I would never get that big.
