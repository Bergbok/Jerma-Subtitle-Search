[00:09.22]Big goofy submarine.
[00:13.19]The beetle.
[00:14.89]I don't really like the beetle.
[00:16.81]I'm probably going to go with frogman.
[00:21.09]Stand ball for turtle fall.
[00:23.92]Pilot, stand ball for turtle fall.
[00:29.28]Stand ball.

[00:33.52]Stand ball.
[00:36.74]Hey, yo, what's up, bro?
[00:38.88]Stand ball.
[00:40.94]Ooh, we got a Titanfall!
[00:42.86]Stand ball.
[00:43.90]What was that, two kills?
[00:45.16]Three kills?
[00:45.58]I don't even know.
[00:47.10]Alright, Slippy, shut the fuck up and keep the line clear, please.
[00:55.53]What the hell is this guy?
[00:58.13]He doesn't have anything over his head, he's just like a guy.
[01:05.50]I guess he was an enemy.
[01:09.62]What?
[01:16.67]Stop doing that!
[01:21.49]You killed me!
[01:24.19]Man, they spent a lot of time on this game, trying to make everybody look like they're busy.
[01:30.06]And I'm a little busy taking out some grunts!
[01:33.70]Too busy taking off.
[01:34.56]Ooh.
[01:36.26]Watch out.
[01:36.96]Stand ball.
[01:39.46]Ooh.
[01:41.26]That's how you stand tall for Titanfall.
[01:45.14]Get on top of this building.
[01:47.42]Where are my grenades?
[01:49.37]There they are.
[01:50.05]Get grenaded.
[01:51.19]Watch this, guys.
[01:52.89]Boom.
[01:53.41]Nope.
[01:54.57]Watch this, guys.
[01:56.69]Boom.
[01:57.87]Boom.
[01:58.73]We're now in the Titan.
[02:00.57]Whoa.
[02:01.01]Ooh.
[02:05.53]Oh, today's just such a tough day at work.
[02:08.46]We're all... Get the fuck out of here.
[02:10.18]I'm trying to make a joke.
[02:11.96]Oh, shit.
[02:13.46]My workers.
[02:15.56]You dare mess with my worker bees?
[02:18.86]Yeah, now you're... I gotta eject.
[02:20.85]Eject!
[02:21.15]I don't even know what I did.
[02:23.37]What the hell just happened?
[02:27.07]I just got thrown?
[02:29.87]Let's go.
[02:31.43]Come on, Spectres.
[02:32.05]You gotta move this way.
[02:33.82]That's, yeah.
[02:34.32]Just follow this guy.
[02:36.42]Four of you, let's go.
[02:37.20]You brainless fucks.
[02:38.44]Here we go.
[02:39.20]It's a tight fall.
[02:39.84]Let's go.
[02:40.72]Everybody stay involved.
[02:41.60]We're staying out.
[02:42.52]Let's get our Spectres away.
[02:46.65]Come on, Spectres.
[02:47.23]Yeah, go.
[02:47.53]Just run.
[02:48.23]Get cover.
[02:48.61]Good cover.
[02:49.03]Good job.
[02:49.69]Nice thinking.
[02:51.45]Gang, I need two Spectres to make the front of the... You just shot one of our workers.
[02:55.99]Nice job.
[03:01.48]Oh, I hate the blue team.
[03:03.08]I hate you all.
[03:04.41]I've never liked anybody on blue team, especially you.
[03:11.77]Hey, you know, I really like your hair color.
[03:13.43]Did you dye your hair?
[03:14.23]You look really nice today.
[03:15.37]Oh, you know, I hate red team.
[03:16.58]Red team sucks.
[03:19.34]Right now, we're going to go on a streak.
[03:21.40]I am not happy right now.
[03:24.42]I am not fucking happy.
[03:25.62]I don't even want my Titan.
[03:26.74]I want my Titan to follow me around like that movie, Little Big Planet, whatever it was.
[03:32.09]What was that movie when the guy, the kid, had a giant?
[03:34.13]My Iron Giant?
[03:35.15]Iron Giant.
[03:35.75]Yeah, that's what it was.
[03:37.15]This is me.
[03:38.51]I'm Timmy, the little Tim guy, and this is the Iron Giant.
[03:42.78]So let's go.
[03:43.26]Kevin Garnett on the Boston Celtics, going for a slam dunk.
[03:48.66]Don't even know if Kevin Garnett's on the Celtics anymore, but we're gonna get a slam dunk!
[03:53.84]Yes!
[03:56.09]Slam dunk.
[03:57.71]He even broke the backboard with that.
[03:59.85]Did you see the backboard shatter when Shaq did the slam?
[04:03.11]Who did I say?
[04:03.79]Kevin Garnett?
[04:04.77]I didn't say Shaq.
[04:06.14]Oh, whatever.
[04:06.94]Whoever basketball player did that, that was really awesome.
[04:11.66]What's your favorite thing?
[04:13.40]Star?
[04:14.42]Special guest.
[04:15.36]Special guest star in the video.
[04:17.84]What is your favorite aspect of Teen Titanfall?
[04:24.03]Beast Boy and Raven.
[04:25.44]Yeah, those are two good characters.
[04:28.39]You know what my favorite part about Scream, Scrite, and Scrawl is?
[04:32.65]What?
[04:33.91]It's gotta be the, it's gotta be the maps.
[04:36.11]They are, whew, you know what I mean?
[04:38.67]Like, whew, whew, that's like sweat coming down off the brow, you know?
[04:45.13]How did you get up there?
[04:47.45]Get down here this instant.
[04:50.67]You're in big trouble.
[04:51.77]You're not supposed to play on the giant skull.
[04:54.95]Wait till your father hears about this.
[04:57.69]What is he shooting at?
[04:58.63]There's nothing even down there.
[05:01.57]He's just being a shit-bomb auto-titan.
[05:03.87]Like, get down here, please.
[05:06.09]Oh, actually, he did just get somebody.
[05:11.93]Walk backwards into this.
[05:13.55]Walk into it.
[05:14.63]Stand tall.
[05:21.61]Let's do this.
[05:24.43]Get away from him!
[05:24.95]Get away!
[05:25.25]He's gonna blow up!
[05:26.05]He's gonna blow up!
[05:28.17]Another Titan.
[05:31.23]Take the missile barrage!
[05:34.29]Oh, that's not a good idea.
[05:35.97]Oh, that's not a good idea for you!
[05:39.86]Let's get... Get!
[05:41.22]Oh, there's a fucking guy on me!
[05:42.26]There's a guy on me!
[05:46.30]Get off me!
[05:48.18]Let's get back to work.
[05:50.24]Is this thing doomed?
[05:51.06]Oh shit, it is doomed!
[05:56.70]Gonna land right on top of him?
[05:58.96]Come here, you fucker!
[06:04.04]Now you're doomed.
[06:06.46]I see you.
[06:07.06]You think you can stay invisible?
[06:10.54]Come here!
[06:12.76]Shit in my face!
[06:19.27]And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you stand tall for Turtlecrawl!
