[00:07.10]Okay, that's what we're doing.
[00:09.81]Yeah, that's what we're doing.
[00:12.57]We better start the recording right now because I'm going to start fucking building it.
[00:17.30]No, we're not doing a washer and dryer.
[00:19.48]Hi guys, today we're going to create a fucking washer and dryer on Jeremy's channel.
[00:24.58]There.
[00:26.31]Alright, fine.
[00:27.89]Right here.
[00:28.35]So he already finished it.
[00:30.41]That was it.
[00:30.73]His washer and dryer is a big square.
[00:33.69]Stop.
[00:34.47]He already made it.
[00:35.35]You put two of them next to each other and he said done.
[00:37.25]Oh, that's it?
[00:39.19]Yeah, done.
[00:40.19]Thank you.
[00:41.06]Subscribe.
[00:42.36]And, you know... Bitch.
[00:48.90]Alright.
[00:51.04]Alright, I actually was recording during that, so... The next page just, like, flew away.
[00:54.20]It's the Atlanta's phone.
[00:56.58]Washer and dryer.
[00:57.58]Alright, what are we really going to make?
[00:59.47]Alright, so did you record that?
[01:00.43]Because that was pretty funny.
[01:01.45]Yeah, I did.
[01:02.59]Cool, that better be up.
[01:05.63]How about, like... I don't know, like a jack-o'-lantern?
[01:08.41]Alright, Spoon, thanks for joining us, man.
[01:10.85]No problem.
[01:14.47]A jack-o'-lantern.
[01:15.95]Let's make a fridge!
[01:17.67]Hi, we're back again!
[01:21.16]Oh, there he goes again.
[01:25.28]Flying away.
[01:26.52]Alright, so we got fridge, washer, dryer.
[01:30.88]And, uh... Yeah.
[01:33.29]We got something else.
[01:35.25]Oh, no.
[01:35.61]What's he got?
[01:36.91]I don't know how long it's taking him to get down here.
[01:43.98]Ready?
[01:44.18]Yeah.
[01:44.84]Stove!
[01:48.41]Uh, the stove looks eerily similar to the washer and dryer.
[01:51.78]Well then we'll just do this, okay?
[01:55.28]Uh, shouldn't the stove be, like, that?
[01:57.16]Nope.
[01:59.32]Oh great, now you made it rain.
[02:01.47]Oh shit, I'm shitting all over the washer and dryer and I broke the ground.
[02:05.87]I know what we're making.
[02:07.37]Uh oh.
[02:08.55]A piano.
[02:09.95]Three, two, one.
[02:13.09]Let's do it.
[02:13.74]Alright, seven minutes, boys.
[02:15.85]Hey, the piano's not... What are you doing?
[02:17.21]The piano's not white.
[02:17.93]That's one of the keys.
[02:20.78]The piano has to be up in the air.
[02:22.00]You can't... Like, you pull off the plates, Matt, and it's just one of those, like... Yeah, this isn't the movie.
[02:29.20]This isn't, like, big when Tom Hanks, like, jumps on the thing on the ground.
[02:33.86]Why not?
[02:34.71]Is that the piano leg right there?
[02:35.85]All right, this is gonna be one of the legs.
[02:37.01]That's one of the legs.
[02:37.55]All right.
[02:39.07]I'm gonna go over here to do a third leg.
[02:41.23]Over here.
[02:44.76]I'm just gonna sit here and watch.
[02:46.36]Oh, come on!
[02:47.14]No, you gotta help!
[02:48.04]You can't just sit there!
[02:49.32]We don't have that much time!
[02:50.56]Yeah, we can finish this, you guys!
[02:54.40]Wait!
[02:55.57]I'm just gonna sit here and watch!
[02:58.21]Alright, no, come together, come together.
[02:59.43]What is that?
[03:00.73]These are the legs!
[03:01.37]Hey, you gotta do some work!
[03:03.19]Why is it so big?
[03:04.69]Is Spooner not doing anything?
[03:06.61]I'm doing something I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[03:09.75]Stop making fun of me, okay?
[03:11.35]We gotta build the piano.
[03:13.22]I'm building a piano.
[03:14.22]Do you see this?
[03:15.26]Alright, come up with that leg.
[03:17.26]One minute has gone by.
[03:18.20]We got only seven.
[03:19.63]This is looking very similar to that horse we did that one time.
[03:22.61]Hey, everything looks like that horse we did that one time.
[03:26.47]Hey.
[03:26.71]I wouldn't speak about horses.
[03:29.19]Alright, let's go.
[03:29.77]Come around here.
[03:30.31]Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[03:31.75]You are a horse.
[03:32.86]Forget that sometimes.
[03:34.42]Is that enough?
[03:34.98]I don't know how you made that.
[03:36.38]That looks good, yeah.
[03:38.27]Remember, we don't have to fill it in.
[03:39.35]That's one of the things in the comments people were saying.
[03:40.89]They're like, don't fill it in.
[03:42.61]No, we need to fill it in.
[03:44.01]Otherwise, it's not real.
[03:45.70]And it won't work.
[03:47.42]It's a functioning piano.
[03:49.04]Yeah.
[03:49.36]Alright, have this one come up too.
[03:51.68]Come on, come on, come on.
[03:52.76]It's too far.
[03:55.38]Oh, it's huge.
[03:57.14]Yeah, this is way, way, way too big.
[04:00.36]Okay, so where's the front of it?
[04:03.02]I don't know.
[04:03.46]We're just making a giant black cube.
[04:07.62]Like, on, like, four legs right now.
[04:09.83]Alright, this will be the front right here.
[04:11.19]I'll work on the front.
[04:12.85]You guys close off.
[04:13.71]This is so big, it's like a highway.
[04:17.01]Dude, this is amazing.
[04:20.30]I'm doing the front.
[04:20.98]I'm doing the front.
[04:23.77]I'm filling it in.
[04:25.25]Okay, so the front is where?
[04:27.33]I'll do the front over here.
[04:28.44]Where the keys are.
[04:29.84]That's what I'm doing.
[04:30.42]I'm working on that right now.
[04:31.68]Wait, what?
[04:32.24]It's down here?
[04:32.88]Why is this piano long?
[04:34.48]They're supposed to be wider than they are long.
[04:36.26]This is a different kind of piano.
[04:39.68]It's like different.
[04:43.18]This is like a Mack truck piano.
[04:49.29]Alright, as long as- Remember the butt comes up- Oh come on, why do we have to make it this long?
[04:54.28]You were the one- You set a giant piano!
[04:57.20]I know, it's all my own fault.
[04:59.76]Which one's the front?
[05:01.24]Who?
[05:01.78]There.
[05:02.42]Yeah, I'm at the front right now.
[05:04.00]You're at the front?
[05:05.86]Mm-hmm.
[05:08.06]Pianos are wider.
[05:09.18]This is like- This works.
[05:10.98]This is long.
[05:12.18]What the hell do keys look like?
[05:14.15]Just, like, two or three blocks, like, white.
[05:17.35]Long.
[05:19.41]Alright, is this working?
[05:21.19]No.
[05:22.55]Does this piano have, like, four keys?
[05:25.99]Yeah, it's gonna have, like, four keys.
[05:28.88]Oh, do you want me to play you a song?
[05:30.38]Sorry, I can only play Hot Cross Buns.
[05:34.34]Yeah, I can only play the first part of Chopsticks.
[05:36.80]That works.
[05:41.32]So what should be the black keys?
[05:43.24]Oh, this is huge!
[05:45.20]I don't know.
[05:46.06]Spoon help!
[05:47.40]What?
[05:47.80]Spoon what?
[05:48.38]Who?
[05:49.02]For what?
[05:50.52]You gotta close the gap.
[05:52.98]I have to what?
[05:54.40]Fine.
[05:54.72]Actually, it doesn't really look that bad.
[05:58.76]No, it does.
[05:59.90]No, don't say that.
[06:03.13]Yeah, don't criticize your own work.
[06:04.33]Are you kidding me?
[06:07.51]You know how hard we worked on this thing?
[06:11.37]All right, the keys really do need to be a little bit better than that.
[06:14.38]There need to be more of them.
[06:17.92]No, it's just, it's fine.
[06:19.66]You put them at the wrong end.
[06:23.20]Hold on, we can widen it a little bit.
[06:26.97]Dude, we have a better chance of, like, just turning this into a guitar right now than we would just finishing it with a piano.
[06:33.17]It's gonna be a giant guitar.
[06:39.18]It just looks like a giant thing with big teeth.
[06:41.52]Like a big monster.
[06:44.97]Looks like Tetris.
[06:46.91]Yeah, it looks like that too.
[06:48.55]So we gotta do one of these episodes saying we're not telling them what it is and we just make it and people have to guess what it is.
[06:54.77]That's actually a pretty good idea.
[06:56.08]Let's start with this one.
[06:57.58]Just bleep out the word.
[07:02.60]Every time somebody says the word piano, I believe it.
[07:04.88]Yeah.
[07:06.57]I'll just put like a censor.
[07:07.83]Hey guys, this is pretty funny.
[07:09.53]Yeah, just do that.
[07:11.43]It works.
[07:12.35]Alright, five minutes have gone by.
[07:13.47]We gotta close this out.
[07:16.65]This works.
[07:17.15]Alright, look at this.
[07:18.89]This is beautiful.
[07:20.87]What are you... Oh, good thing I made it so the keys come out way too far.
[07:25.39]What is this?
[07:28.72]It's all good.
[07:29.48]I'm gonna cry.
[07:31.34]Oh, this is good.
[07:32.17]This is great.
[07:32.89]This is fantastic.
[07:33.91]Dude, we're gonna sell this for so much.
[07:38.52]I don't even know what to think right now.
[07:41.55]Alright, so just for reference, we said the piano is huge.
[07:45.03]The piano is actually bigger than this person.
[07:49.95]It's about as big as a house.
[07:52.93]Nice piano house.
[07:54.37]That being said for how big it is, it has a surprising very small amount of keys.
[08:00.01]Nah, it's just fine.
[08:03.85]Like, what is the rest of this piano for?
[08:05.40]Like, why is it so big?
[08:07.16]If it has no purpose for being this big.
[08:09.32]It's a house.
[08:11.28]Oh, man.
[08:11.56]You can live in the piano.
[08:12.92]And you can also tickle me.
[08:17.34]What?
[08:19.80]Alright, so we are allowed to do that spoon, apparently.
[08:23.41]Only you guys.
[08:24.13]So how much time?
[08:25.59]We have like 40 seconds.
[08:27.68]Nice.
[08:28.16]Alright, is there any detail work we can do with this thing?
[08:31.98]Absolutely not.
[08:32.82]It's ruined.
[08:33.91]This has to come out like this.
[08:38.67]There we go.
[08:40.11]Oh, so this is one of those games where you like stand up and play it.
[08:43.55]You got no chair.
[08:44.71]No, this is one of those pianos where you drink like an elixir and you grow 50 feet tall and then you play it.
[08:49.71]Alright, look at that grand piano.
[08:53.17]I'm making a quick, uh, I'm making a quick chair.
[08:54.95]Stop making towers.
[08:56.60]It's a chair.
[08:58.96]Fifteen seconds.
[09:02.42]I don't like this very much.
[09:03.58]This has to go.
[09:04.62]Ten seconds!
[09:06.25]Hey!
[09:07.17]Stop ruining my work.
[09:08.69]Oh, you did have Chari!
[09:09.53]Five, four, three, two, one, and get the chair done!
[09:13.65]And there it is.
[09:14.55]Nice.
[09:15.99]And that's it.
[09:17.19]Grand piano... And what human being... What human being sits on this chair?
[09:24.10]Like, this small.
[09:25.22]This is not even room for one butt cheek for apparently who's big enough to touch this keyboard.
[09:31.61]And that is going to wrap up the video.
[09:33.13]So thank you guys so much for watching.
[09:34.87]Really do appreciate it.
[09:36.15]And leave a comment with the name and the rating for this thing.
[09:39.14]It looks pretty much like a piano.
[09:41.68]I don't know.
[09:41.96]You guys can be the judge of that one.
[09:43.76]But I'll see you guys all soon.
[09:45.44]And take care, everybody.
