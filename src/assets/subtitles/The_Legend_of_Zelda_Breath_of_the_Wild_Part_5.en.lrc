[00:04.15]Hey, how's it going?
[00:07.03]I see that my title has changed.
[00:09.41]It was supposed to be Breath of the Wild Chill Zone and I'm a little, a little irritated that it was changed without my knowledge.
[00:20.34]I'm just a little irritated about that.
[00:28.06]It was lame.
[00:29.46]It's way funnier.
[00:32.08]No, you don't get it.
[00:33.66]Nobody else is allowed to be funnier than me on my stream.
[00:39.82]Let's know how it works.
[00:46.04]Ego Andy.
[00:48.76]Nobody said true.
[00:50.59]Wow.
[00:50.79]I thought I was going to see some trues.
[00:55.27]Okay, so let me give you a little bit of what's going to happen here today.
[00:58.63]This is going to be kind of a shorter stream.
[01:02.69]I kind of feel like my head hurts.
[01:07.46]And I know why.
[01:09.64]I slept wrong.
[01:12.56]I feel fine.
[01:13.92]But you know when you sleep wrong and you know you slept wrong and you wake up and you're like, shit.
[01:21.49]If I don't go back to bed, then it's gonna be worse, right?
[01:26.94]And then you go back to bed, and you sleep for another hour or two, and you wake up, and you're way worse.
[01:33.94]I hate that.
[01:36.78]That's what happened today.
[01:40.75]So.
[01:43.10]Still going to do the same plan.
[01:44.20]And it may be all the.
[01:47.26]Maybe the horror game last night.
[01:48.48]Maybe I had like a nightmare or something.
[01:50.13]I don't know.
[01:50.41]I mean, I may have had a nightmare.
[01:53.69]That whatever.
[01:56.11]But yeah, here's what we're going to do.
[01:57.01]We're going to do Breath of the Wild for like an hour or two.
[01:59.15]Then we're going to move to Gotham Knights for the last couple of hours.
[02:04.69]The stream's probably going to be like four hours, maybe.
[02:08.84]I got some stuff I want to do later tonight and tomorrow.
[02:11.12]I've got I want to make sure I'm alert.
[02:13.48]So this would probably like a four hour stream.
[02:20.14]This will be the end of the Gotham Knights sponsored content.
[02:25.50]I mean, WB has just been so good to this fucking channel.
[02:32.58]That's all I can really say.
[02:33.46]They really have been.
[02:36.48]So if you guys want to thank somebody, WB has been one of the biggest contributors, one of the biggest supporters of this stream in the last six plus months.
[02:51.33]They've been on point.
[02:53.81]It's been great.
[02:56.13]but that's not right now right now we're gonna play breath of the wild and then later in a couple of hours or so we're gonna do breath uh gotham knights I I'm telling you I'm gonna be like chill today but I say that every time it never happens so we'll see
[03:26.36]Take a sip of this.
[03:29.64]Ah, every time I say I'm going to relax today, it ends up being the most unhinged stream of the week.
[03:36.17]So, you know what?
[03:36.87]It's going to be an insane day today.
[03:40.21]It's going to be so fucked up today.
[03:41.85]I'm going to be loud.
[03:42.87]I'm going to be screaming.
[03:44.19]I'm going to be making jokes.
[03:45.19]It's going to be insane.
[03:46.39]Just so you know.
[03:50.82]And here we are.
[03:54.42]Uh, what was the last thing that I did?
[03:56.24]Trying to think.
[04:00.02]We're in the map, are we?
[04:06.70]Oh, right.
[04:07.12]I upgraded gear.
[04:07.70]Oh, no, no, no.
[04:09.46]I went through that weird maze thing that everybody was mad at me about.
[04:14.22]Yeah, I brute-forced the Lost Woods.
[04:17.72]Well, I did... Excuse me, uh...
[04:21.47]You think I need to, like, oh, I need to know, like, the exact route.
[04:25.49]No, I just put my chest out and fucking walk forward.
[04:28.44]And I make it.
[04:31.22]There's a raid?
[04:34.42]Oh, there is a raid.
[04:35.00]Oh, there is a raid.
[04:36.66]There's, like, three raids.
[04:39.69]This is, like, a coordinated raid.
[04:43.39]Did, like, three people raid me at the same time?
[04:49.26]You look like a greasy today.
[04:51.85]I was going to scream.
[04:52.41]I was going to say, shut up to you.
[04:54.03]But I'm supposed to be chill today.
[04:56.41]Jack Manifold, Slimesicle, and Oofs at the same exact time.
[05:03.10]Just came in with like 3,000 people or something.
[05:05.14]Like, hi guys.
[05:05.54]Hey everybody.
[05:07.94]What's up?
[05:08.36]Thanks for the raids.
[05:10.68]Alright, cool.
[05:11.16]Is this a triple raid song?
[05:15.45]No, I'm supposed to be chilling out today.
[05:21.57]Now, see, that was bad, too.
[05:23.07]That was bad because I didn't give my all.
[05:24.83]Because I have a headache today.
[05:26.21]And this is your fault for making me do that.
[05:28.89]You told me to do that.
[05:29.58]It's your fault.
[05:30.02]That was bad.
[05:30.44]Alright, we're going to play Breath of the Wild.
[05:34.86]Welcome, everybody.
[05:35.28]Thanks for the rates.
[05:35.70]Hope you had good streams.
[05:37.74]And, uh... I'm sorry.
[05:40.08]I... I can't... Fuck, I can't press the button to turn the camera off.
[05:44.56]That's, like, disconnected.
[05:45.93]Because I was trying to fix my camera from last night's, like, glitching stuff.
[05:48.47]I still have no idea why that's happening.
[05:49.79]Alright.
[05:50.97]Alright.
[05:51.97]It's time to look over at the chat and have somebody tell me where I need to go next, because it's been about two weeks since I've opened the game.
[06:13.24]Just do it your way.
[06:14.26]Okay.
[06:19.59]Okay.
[06:22.22]I'm going to go find a shrine.
[06:27.16]I'm going to do it my way.
[06:39.10]Do the, what's the Luddy?
[06:40.86]Do the Luddy?
[06:49.17]Yes.
[06:52.78]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[06:53.50]Hit the Luddy.
[06:54.04]Hit the Luddy.
[06:55.38]Wait, is that the Ludwig dance?
[06:57.88]Is that like the this thing?
[07:00.63]I don't know how to do it.
[07:02.21]And I don't have like real pants on, so I can't stand up.
[07:08.95]It's like you go wham, wham, wham.
[07:10.95]Data tutorial, ask him.
[07:15.24]I don't have real pants on.
[07:16.74]Well, like I do, but there's a big hole in the middle.
[07:25.17]Fucked up.
[07:26.65]Um, listen.
[07:27.83]It's because the button doesn't work.
[07:29.19]We're going to move on.
[07:34.67]I'll do the Luddy.
[07:35.73]Just not now.
[07:37.67]I'll try the Luddy.
[07:38.89]I have to study it for a little bit though.
[07:40.59]I'll try it next stream.
[07:44.05]Okay.
[07:47.41]I need a shrine.
[07:48.59]There's a tower over there.
[07:53.85]Should I just go to the tower?
[07:55.17]Why not, right?
[07:58.01]I'm just gonna go activate that tower.
[08:00.87]Let's go.
[08:02.43]I forget what P is.
[08:03.03]I'm good.
[08:09.94]Shrine is down over there.
[08:13.92]Yeah, I'm going for that tower straight ahead.
[08:18.18]Wait, hold on a minute.
[08:18.76]Isn't Calamity Ganon over here?
[08:20.36]I have to be careful.
[08:24.57]Oh, what's the toothpaste story?
[08:25.52]You're right, forgot to tell you.
[08:26.94]Okay, so... I was trying to... I'm multitasking, right?
[08:30.92]So I'm brushing my teeth and, like, walking around, getting the stream kind of ready.
[08:35.68]Because it's like, oh, brushing your teeth takes, like, a few minutes.
[08:38.94]And hold on a second.
[08:45.61]Pretty sick.
[08:46.15]Yeah- Yeah.
[08:51.21]I think that deserves applause, I think.
[08:59.48]Oh, nice.
[08:59.98]All right.
[09:00.70]Thank you.
[09:02.09]I appreciate it.
[09:02.63]Thank you for that.
[09:03.53]What about you?
[09:05.07]What about you?
[09:07.73]No.
[09:08.19]Does that cover both of you?
[09:11.53]All right.
[09:12.45]That covers both of you.
[09:14.31]Does that cover... Wait.
[09:14.93]Do you have something?
[09:15.49]Okay.
[09:19.29]Covers both of you.
[09:23.09]Mr. Green.
[09:25.29]How is that extortion?
[09:28.97]I just asked.
[09:29.45]I was like, is that covering both of you?
[09:34.35]That's kind of fucked up.
[09:36.87]I get a gift, and I point to the... Does that cover both of you?
[09:41.56]Oh, shit.
[09:42.22]That means you want two things.
[09:48.34]Alright, anyways.
[09:49.14]The toothpaste story.
[09:49.86]So I'm walking around.
[09:50.60]I don't even know.
[09:50.96]I forgot where Iberger I was walking.
[09:52.17]Whatever.
[09:52.91]I'm going this way now.
[09:55.42]So I'm walking around brushing my teeth and I was my switch wasn't plugged in So I'm like shit.
[10:04.23]Where's the cord to the switch and I'm I don't know I'm kind of a monster of ultimate extreme convenience so I have I have an iPad that uses
[10:19.74]the usbc right on the switch and if I don't know where that cord is I will just rip it out of the back of the switch and plug it next to my bed right it's just because it's just a usbc power cable so that's there and hold on a second I'm getting speech jammed so
[10:47.89]I'm trying to tell a story.
[10:49.05]Shut up.
[10:49.85]Yeah, look over your head.
[10:51.03]It's fine.
[10:51.35]I probably shouldn't be using this weapon, right?
[11:01.92]No, it's fine.
[11:02.40]This thing's good.
[11:07.25]Just pause it.
[11:09.25]I'm right here.
[11:09.73]I'll be fine.
[11:10.13]Okay, that's fine.
[11:13.83]So, anyways.
[11:14.53]These skeletons are the most annoying enemy in the game, by the way.
[11:17.85]Just running.
[11:18.99]Alright, so anyways.
[11:25.30]Start from the beginning.
[11:26.12]I'll start from the beginning.
[11:27.17]You don't really need to know, but... Trine!
[11:43.52]Where is it?
[11:52.87]Is it up top?
[12:02.26]It's below me, I think.
[12:03.18]Where is it?
[12:04.66]No, it's down here.
[12:05.24]Yep.
[12:08.56]Nice.
[12:08.94]All right, cool.
[12:12.82]Let me heal before I- actually, we'll see what it is.
[12:14.85]Alright, so anyways.
[12:17.45]Um, I'm walking around brushing my teeth, because I'm trying to do two things at once, and I'm like, fuck, I need my switch cord, because I need- it's plugged into the, uh, where the bed is.
[12:23.91]So I pull it up from the wall, and as I'm walking, remember, the toothbrush with a bunch of foaming toothpastes in my mouth.
[12:30.21]So I'm like, let me get it out of the back, and I go and I pull it out, and I walk, and I start to pull the cord, and it's a long cord.
[12:38.57]And there's a cup of water next to where the bed is.
[12:41.31]You know, I want a cup of water so I can sip on it before I sleep and stuff.
[12:44.37]Or when I wake up, whatever.
[12:45.83]So the cord kind of wrapped around the water.
[12:48.60]And pulled it down.
[12:51.28]And I went like this.
[12:52.44]I went... Like... Because I obviously don't want to spill shit.
[12:57.14]And I inhaled like a whole mouthful of fucking toothpaste.
[13:01.84]And it still hurts.
[13:06.74]There's the whole story.
[13:11.92]You deserved it.
[13:14.61]Yeah.
[13:18.11]Don't rush.
[13:23.03]It's too late to bet on this, I think.
[13:30.27]Combat trial.
[13:31.44]Uh-oh.
[13:38.88]I have a lot of good weapons, though.
[13:40.28]But I don't want to use them all.
[13:46.74]This is just a... Alright, this is a full recovery and hearts.
[13:51.59]Should I do defense, maybe?
[13:54.29]I'm just gonna go super hearts.
[14:01.54]Alright, here we go.
[14:07.41]There's another raid?
[14:09.25]Oh, there is another raid.
[14:10.72]I'm just getting... Everybody's raiding this channel.
[14:14.46]Holy shit.
[14:16.90]RT.
[14:17.66]RT game, what's up, man?
[14:20.66]Thanks for the raid.
[14:26.83]Welcome, everybody.
[14:28.33]Currently playing Breath of the Wild.
[14:34.23]Probably shouldn't use this weapon.
[14:35.59]This thing's very heavy.
[14:38.75]It's alright.
[14:42.50]I didn't tweet the stream out?
[14:43.72]Oh shit.
[14:44.64]Yeah, I'll tweet the stream out.
[15:00.42]There it is.
[15:00.86]There it is.
[15:01.26]There it is.
[15:01.70]There it is.
[15:03.58]What?
[15:03.78]Don't hurt me.
[15:10.34]Alright.
[15:10.68]What should I use?
[15:11.44]Probably the... No.
[15:12.95]I want to save that.
[15:13.69]Probably the battle axe.
[15:15.75]Yeah.
[15:16.11]I got two of these.
[15:19.35]Come on.
[15:20.41]What do you got?
[15:23.49]I got stuck on the fucking wall.
[15:33.99]How come I'm not locked on?
[15:35.07]I guess I am.
[15:46.25]What just happened?
[15:46.91]I'm alright.
[15:53.61]So bad.
[15:54.17]It's supposed to be an emote only mode.
[15:55.65]Turn it off.
[15:56.07]I don't want to see people write that.
[16:10.27]That was awful reaction speed, by the way.
[16:13.53]There's another raid.
[16:15.31]How many people?
[16:16.19]Is this like a joke on Twitch today?
[16:17.91]That's Repster.
[16:21.80]What's up?
[16:25.38]Oh, right.
[16:25.72]I forgot what to do about this.
[16:36.73]Gotta be something good at this.
[16:44.92]Alright, gotta do the...
[17:15.88]Shoot your bow in the air?
[17:17.88]Oops.
[17:22.36]What is it doing?
[17:29.78]Oh shit, right, you have to sprint, right?
[17:42.52]Why did that take so long for him to do that?
[18:13.60]Nice.
[18:15.23]Nice.
[18:15.63]Okay.
[18:20.99]I forgot what the thing on the bottom right was until two seconds ago.
[18:25.28]I thought that was my gas tank for some reason.
[18:31.34]I was like, oh, I'm full.
[18:33.40]Like, oh, I need gas or something.
[18:34.57]I don't know.
[18:46.36]What's in here?
[18:49.03]Frost Spear.
[18:51.33]Attack when the blade glows blue to chill the air and freeze your foe.
[18:56.55]Yeah, bro.
[19:01.67]I have to shut up.
[19:02.61]Seriously.
[19:03.05]Tweet.
[19:07.46]Tweet the stream.
[19:10.86]My phone's not even up here.
[19:12.32]I have no idea where my phone even is.
[19:15.24]It's not even up here.
[19:15.90]Should I tweet this?
[19:18.50]I will in a minute.
[19:20.22]I'll go take a pee break in like two minutes.
[19:21.69]What should I get rid of?
[19:26.69]I don't think I can get rid of anything.
[19:32.96]Maybe the guardian spear?
[19:35.32]This thing kind of sucks, doesn't it?
[19:41.60]Yeah.
[19:46.58]Guardian spirits, meh.
[19:47.95]Yeah, I'll use this instead.
[19:48.97]Alright, so now I can think this should be enough to upgrade.
[20:00.95]We have Jojo's Bizarre Adventure here.
[20:05.17]Um, alright.
[20:06.79]Is that a good thing?
[20:13.48]Jojo's Bizarre Adventure here.
[20:22.40]Is this just like a swoop?
[20:25.51]He's talking about like a swoop.
[20:33.19]I got four of these now.
[20:34.62]Should I do?
[20:34.98]I can do health.
[20:35.94]Health.
[20:36.48]Health.
[20:55.27]Oh, right, I'm swimming.
[20:56.05]I forgot.
[20:56.63]I thought I was just sitting in a chair.
[20:59.56]Alright, let's go!
[21:00.16]I need to go to one of those spirit places.
[21:08.00]Where's the nearest one?
[21:12.85]Although, where's the guardian here?
[21:14.03]There's that lizard guardian.
[21:18.31]Should I do the lizard?
[21:18.85]Should I try the lizard guardian?
[21:19.73]It's behind you.
[21:27.01]I think I was right about to do the lizard temple, right?
[21:30.88]What was that?
[21:32.98]Somebody just went like... What was that?
[21:50.40]It was my mask?
[21:54.22]There's a Korok nearby.
[21:55.56]Okay.
[21:57.48]But where is it?
[22:06.57]Up there?
[22:07.09]In the stump?
[22:09.25]Probably in the stump.
[22:19.23]No help.
[22:22.23]Thanks for fucking nothing.
[22:30.07]Oh, it is in the stump.
[22:31.23]All right.
[22:37.28]Nice.
[22:37.64]Look at all these bat wings.
[22:42.62]And don't miss the Batman Gotham Nightstream.
[22:45.32]Coming up in about an hour and a half.
[22:47.14]Or maybe an hour or so.
[22:55.01]Do I have something that can break this?
[22:56.97]Yeah.
[23:11.86]Smash it.
[23:13.80]Blink.
[23:19.94]Stop climbing and smash it!
[23:24.57]Let go!
[23:25.23]This game's a 10 out of 10 for all of you.
[23:31.57]This game is like a 9.9.8 now for me.
[23:47.30]Yeah, I mean, seriously.
[23:48.46]It was like a 10 out of 10.
[23:50.12]It just went down to a 9.999990.
[23:51.64]It's definitely at the top, right?
[23:53.40]It just started raining right when I get to this point.
[24:10.14]I'm trying to come up the tree!
[24:11.60]Can I just jump?
[24:28.18]I think I can just jump, right?
[24:40.20]Put the climbing gear on.
[24:41.18]9.9 is bigger than 9.10.
[24:44.06]Climb a bit first.
[24:47.02]It's raining really hard.
[25:09.62]Cut the tree down.
[25:11.12]Will that work?
[25:13.89]Why would I want to do that?
[25:15.79]Yeah, 9... Oh, no.
[25:16.77]Okay, I said 9.999999999990.
[25:17.45]That's higher than 9.1111... Yeah, I know.
[25:19.05]The rain is almost over.
[25:19.93]We still have to wait 5 minutes.
[25:43.05]Just campfire and then sleep.
[25:47.98]I think that just sitting here for another 30 seconds will be fine.
[25:52.94]Climb the side of the stump instead.
[25:55.75]Is this not getting hit by the rain?
[25:56.89]I mean, it is.
[25:59.51]But maybe I can just leap up here.
[26:12.42]Do the tweet while you wait.
[26:15.28]I got it right here.
[26:21.21]I'm gonna tweet.
[26:25.08]I'm gonna tweet while I wait.
[26:25.84]I'll be right back.
[26:27.12]I'll be right back.
[26:27.88]I'm gonna tweet.
[26:55.23]Oh my goodness.
[26:57.72]Holly is so cute.
[26:59.56]Can I just tell you that?
[27:01.42]So I just walked, I was like, oh, I'm gonna go find my phone.
[27:03.48]I walked over.
[27:04.00]And I noticed that my phone was on the ground.
[27:09.58]Like in front of, like with, like, she slid it under the door.
[27:12.36]For a second I was like, why is my phone on the ground?
[27:17.37]Oh, that's right.
[27:18.25]That's, okay.
[27:20.13]That was really sweet.
[27:20.97]Okay.
[27:21.31]Okay.
[27:27.56]Alright, what's a good tweet?
[27:29.48]Breath of the- Well, I'm only gonna be- Breath of the Wild for like an hour and ten minutes!
[27:43.33]That's actually kind of a funny- There's not another raid, right?
[27:45.81]No.
[27:46.41]Somebody just said that.
[27:51.36]I actually think that's kind of funny.
[27:52.38]Breath of the Wild for an hour and ten minutes.
[28:10.90]That's a banger tweet.
[28:12.00]It kind of is.
[28:16.41]There we go.
[28:17.37]Alright, now everyone's gonna know I'm live.
[28:24.89]And, take a look.
[28:26.69]In that amount of time, we're good.
[28:27.99]I can get my seed here.
[28:32.15]Okay.
[28:45.22]I did it first.
[28:45.64]I have four of these now.
[28:53.02]I know you can't see it, but I have four.
[28:55.18]It's not enough, I don't think.
[29:01.09]Cool.
[29:01.45]All right.
[29:02.07]So that's good.
[29:03.59]Let me go examine some stuff.
[29:15.75]Where... The Hero's Sword?
[29:18.64]Do I have to... Should I just go back and do this?
[29:21.64]No, right, I need to have... Right, right, I need to have a certain amount of HP to even attempt it.
[29:28.73]I'm gonna go back here.
[29:30.01]Let's get another good view of the, kind of, the world around us.
[29:34.53]From what tower?
[29:35.47]This tower.
[29:36.83]Oops.
[29:40.44]You need 13 hearts.
[29:45.35]What do you mean?
[29:45.95]The top Twitter reply, lol.
[29:49.80]Who's like the joker?
[29:51.16]Let's see.
[29:57.44]This tweet sucks.
[30:04.77]Alright.
[30:07.31]Guys, I don't use Twitter.
[30:08.43]I don't use anything.
[30:14.78]Okay, so.
[30:15.66]What else should I do in the next, like, hour or so?
[30:25.77]It's an eye headache too.
[30:26.87]It's like right here.
[30:33.07]Do the tower?
[30:35.61]Oh, right.
[30:35.95]I was going to go to that tower.
[30:36.79]That's right.
[30:39.43]There's three more shrines in this area.
[30:41.20]Really?
[30:41.90]Really?
[30:44.24]In the forest?
[30:47.08]Like this way?
[30:50.22]I'm trying to my favorite part of this whole game, so... Like over here?
[30:53.38]I don't see any.
[31:10.38]Inside the forest.
[31:12.88]They're inside the forest.
[31:15.24]Just teleport inside.
[31:16.18]I was just seeing if I could get a good view.
[31:24.92]Kind of a bad time to get transported somewhere.
[31:35.66]Talk to the Koroks.
[31:38.22]Do you pretend to read comments out in chat?
[31:42.01]Um, I think what happens and I've seen people be like, what are you talking about?
[31:46.32]I think as the chat moves fast and I only have a brief second to kind of go like this, I will see, I think a lot of streamers do this too, where you will see, like, let's say the sentence has 10 words in it.
[32:01.25]I'll see like.
[32:02.43]Like word one, word four, five, six, and word eight.
[32:06.31]And I kind of have to be like, all right, I'm going to fill in the blank.
[32:10.82]Does that answer your question?
[32:14.38]Sometimes I can see the whole thing.
[32:15.32]Depending how fast the chat is moving.
[32:18.86]Alright, so I gotta talk to the Koroks.
[32:22.75]Which, they're in like the village I'm imagining, right?
[32:25.21]They're like down in here.
[32:29.75]There's one here.
[32:40.61]Where's like the proper village village where they're all hanging out and there's like shops and stuff?
[32:50.13]Oh, it's you!
[32:50.77]Alright.
[32:59.95]I have seeds.
[33:04.47]Alright, how much is it?
[33:05.37]What should I get?
[33:06.31]Another weapon stash?
[33:08.69]It's three for another weapon.
[33:09.87]I have four.
[33:11.71]I feel like I'm always low on weapons.
[33:14.63]I always feel like I need more weapons.
[33:17.47]Or a bow.
[33:19.66]I'm doing weapons.
[33:20.86]I'm always throwing stuff away.
[33:22.20]Shields are fine.
[33:25.48]Just dodge, forehead, you know what I mean?
[33:26.90]I don't think I have enough to do anything.
[33:28.50]Go into the tree now.
[34:00.86]Wait, who's that?
[34:01.38]It was a prediction that you'd come, I think.
[34:19.90]Us Koroks all got together and prepared some trials just for you, Mr. Hero.
[34:24.77]If you pass the very tough trials we prepared, pulling out the Master Sword would be a piece of cake.
[34:30.57]Probably.
[34:32.12]Among the trials is an extra tough one designed by me, the Elder of Korok Forest.
[34:37.04]So will you test your mettle in the Korok Trials?
[34:40.04]I'll do it.
[34:44.18]You're gonna get conned eventually if you just keep doing what everybody asks you to.
[34:46.98]Anyways, where was I?
[34:47.70]Oh yeah, the Korok Trials.
[34:49.20]Long story short, you need to visit all the shrines in Korok Forest so that you can be considered a real grown-up.
[34:54.18]Trial 1.
[34:55.30]In the Southwest Forest.
[34:56.68]Trial of Second Sight.
[34:59.14]Trial 2.
[35:00.46]In the Northwest Forest.
[35:01.66]The Lost Pilgrimage.
[35:03.52]Trial 3.
[35:05.32]I would say the worst of the three movies.
[35:07.76]The Test of Wood.
[35:08.90]That does sound like the worst of them, by the way.
[35:11.50]That sounds like the shittiest movie out of them all.
[35:14.21]You can overcome the Korok Trials.
[35:17.33]Oh, and here comes Star Wars.
[35:20.36]Episode 8.
[35:21.82]A test of wood.
[35:23.98]The other two were way cooler sounding.
[35:35.16]Okay, so I just have to go find them.
[35:38.74]What about you?
[35:41.22]It's Mr. Hero.
[35:43.46]Yay, Mr. Hero came to visit us in the forest.
[35:45.08]What took you so long?
[35:48.04]Peaks thought of a trial that will make Mr. Hero stronger.
[35:50.98]You won't have to fight, and it's not scary.
[35:56.03]Irma fans that are in their mid-40s are plus-2ing that.
[36:03.37]I would've.
[36:06.56]You'll need to be extra careful, so I want to see a bloopy.
[36:10.29]It's a blue, glowy, hoppy thing that glows in the dark, just about Peek's size.
[36:15.31]I just really want to see a bloopy.
[36:18.43]Even if it's just a picture of one.
[36:19.65]Alright, I'll take a picture of a bloopy.
[36:23.01]What's a bloopy?
[36:27.99]I knew you were a nice guy, Mr. Hero.
[36:29.57]Thanks for listening to Peek's requests.
[36:35.48]It's a little blue bunny.
[36:36.72]Oh, okay.
[36:40.38]Well, he just explained it while I was asking you.
[36:43.32]I looked over, missed the part where he said what it was, because I was asking you guys.
[36:49.62]Okay, cool.
[37:00.11]Anybody else have anything in here?
[37:09.37]Oh, Mr. Hero, welcome to the Great Deku Tree's navel.
[37:13.28]Made a bed out of leaves just for you, Mr. Hero.
[37:15.64]Take as long as you like with yawns and the Zs.
[37:18.18]Um, I have full health, I don't really need it.
[37:21.44]You look like a million rupees.
[37:23.62]Yeah, I would have guessed that a bloopy was a blue rupee.
[37:26.21]That's what I thought it was.
[37:36.79]Sleep, sleep, sleep in the bed, sleep.
[37:38.85]Why is everybody saying sad?
[37:42.25]Mr. Hero.
[37:46.00]That just reminds me of Otto.
[37:48.72]I always say Mr. And then whatever Otto currently is doing.
[37:55.18]Oh, here you go, Mr. Treat.
[37:56.02]Oh, look, Mr. Good Boy.
[38:00.26]Oh, Mr. Hungry, right?
[38:02.93]It's just he's Mr. Whatever he's currently doing.
[38:06.79]Okay, here's the shop.
[38:09.19]Mr. Otto.
[38:09.67]Alright, what do you have?
[38:13.39]Okay.
[38:20.19]Do we get a running gag for the rest of the stream?
[38:28.86]You mean you want me to do, like, Mr. Otto stuff for the rest of the stream?
[38:31.74]Alright, where are these shrines?
[38:35.56]The one with Northwest?
[38:37.62]What?
[38:38.02]Hawk?
[38:39.02]For what?
[38:42.96]Ah, if you hope to extract the sword, you'll need to summon a hero's strength.
[38:48.84]Let us see how brightly your life force burns.
[38:55.18]The wise mystical tree.
[39:00.65]Okay, so I have to go northwest.
[39:04.35]So I'm imagining it's probably here.
[39:07.19]Can I just go here?
[39:08.79]The other one was south?
[39:12.19]Something?
[39:14.62]South?
[39:14.90]I have to select the quest.
[39:21.24]I don't... I don't wanna.
[39:27.00]Uh, this one.
[39:29.90]Where is it?
[39:38.05]There it is.
[39:40.89]Oh!
[39:45.03]Very cool.
[39:48.70]Is anybody- Okay.
[39:50.26]I hate to say this, because this is like a really cool thing, but when I see this sword, I don't think that looks powerful.
[39:58.76]I think that looks like it's on the shelf at Walmart.
[40:03.07]Like that exact thing is on the shelf at Target.
[40:06.15]And it's like, it's just like, look, it's a toy at Target.
[40:10.18]And I just go, it looks, but that thing's made out of foam to me.
[40:16.22]Oh my God, I almost pulled my setup down.
[40:23.57]It's a cool, and it sucks because that's like a really cool design, but it's turned into a foam toy for me.
[40:36.91]And yeah, I've contemplated buying it.
[40:38.38]You know how many times I've walked by that toy?
[40:42.14]I'm making the entire story up just to make it very clear.
[40:44.68]You know how many times I've walked by that sword at Target and gone... You know... That might look pretty good on my shelf.
[40:54.46]And then everybody in the audience is laughing like I'm a comedian.
[40:56.43]You know what I mean?
[40:58.97]And I go like this.
[41:01.15]I look at the microphone like...
[41:07.70]Why are you clout chasing?
[41:12.04]Actual liar.
[41:14.15]Well, no, that's not entirely inaccurate.
[41:23.65]Keep going and not get lost in the mist.
[41:25.51]Oh, shit.
[41:27.04]This is... Okay.
[41:28.26]Okay.
[41:30.22]Don't worry, I've got a cryptic little hint for you.
[41:33.24]Hungry trees will show you the way.
[41:34.90]Spy their iron to win the day.
[41:37.86]Didn't it make that sound cool?
[41:38.84]Okay.
[41:43.77]So, where do I go?
[41:59.11]I'm kidding.
[41:59.69]I'm not doing that again.
[42:01.19]I'm kidding.
[42:05.81]Everyone just freaked out.
[42:06.65]They're like, no, dude, don't do that again.
[42:08.63]Okay.
[42:10.93]The trees have iron.
[42:12.61]They like the way.
[42:18.54]You'll make your way out of here, Link, any day.
[42:22.04]Check the ground.
[42:22.72]Check the air.
[42:23.28]What does that actually mean, though?
[42:29.64]They have like iron deposits on the ones that I can go walk over to or something.
[42:49.96]I just see somebody sitting.
[42:52.40]It's like a school play to me.
[42:54.23]I just see somebody sitting, like the person that plays the piano the whole time.
[42:58.01]You know, it's like that older lady usually is playing the piano.
[43:01.63]And right now there's a scene going on, and she's sitting down in that little pit.
[43:05.48]Just like... And the kids are all up there doing their scene.
[43:12.00]I don't think anybody realizes, like...
[43:17.65]how unbelievably talented and how much stress that fucking job was.
[43:22.69]And I think a lot of them were just doing it for free.
[43:26.93]Oh, hey, you need to know literally all the music.
[43:29.35]You need to know every single song.
[43:30.97]You need to be the cue for every single fucking actor.
[43:34.91]And by the way, you got an entire audience of people watching you play the piano and you are the quarterback of the entire show.
[43:42.08]What?
[43:42.76]That seemed like you're the only, you're the sole musician of the entire play?
[43:51.83]Ah, there we go.
[43:54.19]Iron leads the way.
[43:55.27]There's no iron there.
[44:17.94]You know what else is crazy about those musicians?
[44:22.54]Those kids would just fuck up all the time.
[44:25.37]And the timing would change in the song in real time to change the song so it matched what the kid was fucking singing.
[44:35.36]Do you understand how unbelievable that is?
[44:40.70]That's unbelievable.
[44:45.78]The song would change mid-song, and they would, fix it, and I'm doing a different tempo, the same song, different tempo to match your singing.
[44:52.30]Okay, well, there's another one.
[45:08.35]Iron?
[45:09.89]No.
[45:11.71]No.
[45:16.51]iron no oh my god I didn't want to do that I was trying to zoom the camera in I went the wrong way just find the iron in the trees there's one here
[45:46.48]Is there iron in this one?
[45:47.32]What are you doing here?
[46:05.29]It's supposed to be like a magical forest.
[46:07.80]Wait.
[46:18.43]Is that what you're talking about?
[46:19.21]You want to shoot that?
[46:29.64]Yeah, no.
[46:30.98]Do I have to break it?
[46:31.72]I tried to swing at it.
[46:50.20]Iron lights the way.
[46:51.40]It's the only way.
[46:53.04]Find your way through the forest.
[46:59.39]With luck, you won't act like a tourist.
[47:01.65]What was the poem?
[47:08.59]Yes, yes, yes.
[47:10.03]I don't know what that means.
[47:12.91]Go through them.
[47:15.18]Wait.
[47:17.60]That one has iron.
[47:22.37]Which one?
[47:22.65]The one that has iron in its mouth?
[47:27.86]I don't see anything else with iron.
[47:29.26]Like, from here.
[47:54.92]Iron?
[48:00.16]Camera, camera, camera, camera, camera.
[48:08.91]Okay.
[48:17.09]Take a picture of it?
[48:21.21]Oh, and then I can track where the iron is in the mouths.
[48:26.93]Look at that.
[48:28.47]Mm-hmm.
[48:30.33]I get it.
[48:32.30]Then I can set it to the tracker.
[48:33.94]I get it.
[48:35.34]Okay, let's do it.
[48:38.16]Start over.
[48:38.52]Yeah, that's fine.
[48:41.34]Start over.
[48:46.94]Okay, so...
[48:52.44]First one's over here.
[48:53.14]Let's get the camera out.
[48:59.24]And... No.
[49:19.76]Gatorade, yeah.
[49:20.86]Lightning, yeah.
[49:21.90]Shoot it with a lightning arrow.
[49:25.70]I don't... Do I even have a lightning arrow?
[49:27.18]I don't even have shock arrows.
[49:44.81]Lightning... Lightning's picture.
[49:46.45]Picture of a lightning.
[49:47.19]Should we take a picture of the lightning?
[49:50.56]Football, football, football.
[49:52.06]He scored.
[49:52.84]Take a picture of the lightning.
[49:54.72]Blah, blah, blah.
[49:56.00]Fool, fool.
[49:56.76]You're a fool.
[49:57.76]Put your arm in the air.
[49:58.70]It's this way, right?
[50:00.70]Because he's pointing this way?
[50:06.11]Here's another one.
[50:08.11]Where are you pointing?
[50:10.67]Fork.
[50:28.18]Am I going to do this for the whole time before I play Gotham Knights?
[50:31.22]One of the mods just tell me where to go.
[50:32.46]Alright, just translate one of the hieroglyphics.
[50:49.56]What do they mean by this?
[50:52.28]Just translate one of them.
[50:56.17]The ref does not mean football.
[51:00.31]I'll tell you that much.
[51:02.41]Yeah, I mean, it's not like Legend of Zelda presents Madden 2025.
[51:06.28]It's the shape.
[51:27.67]Alright, well I'm not helping you anymore.
[51:29.11]Piece of shit.
[51:31.98]Hey!
[51:32.38]Hey!
[51:34.88]Hey!
[51:46.82]Okay.
[51:47.68]Lightning, arms up!
[51:53.66]Do I have to get struck by lightning?
[51:54.92]Do I have to stand on top and have lightning strike or something?
[51:57.14]Did I just fucking softlock myself?
[52:06.17]No, alright.
[52:07.91]Picture, picture, picture!
[52:09.01]Up, up, up, up, up!
[52:10.97]No!
[52:11.23]No!
[52:23.96]Octopus arm!
[52:24.82]Lightning!
[52:34.30]What shape are the arms making?
[52:35.90]Alright, let me defend myself.
[52:43.51]I need to defend myself.
[52:46.19]I forgot that the magnet power was in the game.
[53:26.33]What is going on?
[53:37.61]It won't come out of the mouth.
[53:41.83]It was making a sound.
[53:42.75]Okay.
[53:43.89]Down.
[53:45.37]Up.
[53:47.03]Down.
[53:50.70]Left.
[53:52.20]Why does it say, like, put it down?
[53:53.41]I can't.
[54:01.57]You're almost there, dude.
[54:05.38]Take a picture of it when it's... Push.
[54:12.48]Pull.
[54:13.08]Up.
[54:13.38]Down.
[54:15.42]Take a picture of it.
[54:16.06]Doesn't make any sense.
[54:19.83]Remember the poem.
[54:21.71]I don't remember the poem.
[54:22.53]Let me ask the guy again.
[54:26.31]I can dodge a fucking battleaxe.
[54:28.85]I can't wait.
[54:29.73]I cannot wait until everyone's like, oh, you know, I'm not gonna like say he's like, you know, fucking stupid anymore.
[54:37.15]Cause like that stream was crazy.
[54:38.95]Like, holy shit.
[54:40.94]Hungry trees will show you the way.
[54:42.26]Spy their iron to win the day.
[54:50.76]Do I just have to hold it and walk away?
[54:53.37]Spy their iron.
[55:08.74]So where's the next one?
[55:09.46]Because I'm currently...
[55:22.16]Permanently ban the person that told him to go back into the woods.
[55:28.65]Shit.
[55:29.93]Yeah, I did.
[55:31.41]Who of you said to go do these?
[55:34.61]You're the reason why.
[55:35.29]I looked over and I was like, yeah, alright.

[56:07.43]Eye.
[56:07.95]Magnet.
[56:08.67]Eye.
[56:11.19]Magnetize the eye.
[56:13.30]Magnet on the eye.
[56:14.90]Why did I come in here?
[56:15.80]I'm gonna leave.
[56:16.26]I'm gonna leave.
[56:17.82]I'm gonna go to the shrine.
[56:22.10]I can't get stuck here for like another hour.
[56:27.19]Magnetize the eye.
[56:28.11]Magnet eye.
[56:28.71]Magnet eye.
[56:29.55]Magnet eye.
[56:30.89]Magnet on the eye.
[56:31.73]I'm not getting stuck here for an hour.
[56:36.22]This is like shit you come back to.
[56:37.34]And you just like melt on the couch.
[56:40.16]And you just don't care that like no one can watch you do this for an hour.
[56:44.48]Take a picture of the magnet.
[56:51.51]Frame.
[56:51.91]Magnet frame.
[56:59.58]Magnet, then picture?
[57:01.28]But how do I even activate that?
[57:20.75]Magnet...
[57:29.55]What am I looking for?
[57:43.51]So magnet and then eye, look.
[57:46.19]Magnet and look.
[57:49.73]Magnet, then look, eye.
[57:52.46]Magnet, look.
[57:56.54]Magnet, then look at the eye.
[58:00.81]Magnet, then look.
[58:02.27]Alright, I'm magnet- I'm magneting right now and I'm looking and nothing's happening.
[58:17.96]Don't magnet the iron.
[58:26.40]Because it'll show up in the-
[58:32.23]Don't mag- just magnetize and walk around.
[58:43.82]Don't- I threw that.
[58:44.76]I didn't want to- Alright, where is the one from here then?
[59:03.55]I just heard Ollie laugh.
[59:07.03]I heard it.
[59:09.85]I just heard it.
[59:10.47]I overthink everything, really.
[59:30.98]I always do this.
[59:31.62]I play chess when the game's playing checkers.
[59:33.82]I do it every time.
[59:34.68]I seriously do.
[59:35.38]Remember the last time I was here, it was like, oh, I need to find the song and go to the beat and turn my back backwards to the song and go backwards.
[59:44.71]It's like, no, dude, the flame is just pointing in the direction you're supposed to walk.
[59:51.40]It was so simple.
[60:04.03]Okay, but where the hell is the other one?
[60:05.63]There's one right here.
[60:41.74]There it is.
[60:43.64]There it is.
[60:44.58]Ya-ha-ha!
[60:58.65]Get over there.
[60:59.39]Edit your tweet.
[61:05.37]Stuck in the Kokiri forest for an hour and ten minutes.
[61:11.80]I hate these enemies.
[61:12.62]They're so annoying.
[61:17.58]Skeleton enemies in every game are so stupid.
[61:21.08]They're like, you killed it, but you didn't.
[61:23.16]It's growing back to life.
[61:25.56]No, just die.
[61:26.58]Just let it be.
[61:27.86]Skeletons always do this.
[61:32.04]We need some variety in the skeleton enemies that we face in these games.
[61:36.14]They can't all be this.
[61:41.36]What if I happen to the skeletal mage, by the way, like, just, like, casting, like, fucking fireballs and stuff?
[61:46.25]What happened?
[61:46.81]We haven't seen that since, like, Diablo 2.
[61:48.13]That's a rusty shield.
[61:59.76]Feed me the aged shield guarded by monsters eternal.
[62:02.59]My brother will repay you in kind.
[62:29.66]I have to shut up.
[62:39.91]Okay, so that chest.
[62:46.79]Where'd that chest go?
[62:54.76]That's it?
[63:00.11]One Amber.
[63:03.07]One Amber for doing this.
[63:07.59]Is there a leaf anywhere?
[63:13.20]Do I have anything?
[63:15.60]Can I just like swing this in?
[63:17.18]No, it needs to be a leaf.
[63:17.88]I don't have a leaf.
[63:20.28]I just swim over there.
[63:44.88]Did you use the ice?
[63:45.48]Yeah, but I want to... When do I ever get to do this?
[63:52.22]Please place my chest in my mouth.
[64:02.38]The shield eater's brother stole it from me.
[64:09.42]Okay.
[64:53.63]And what does that do for us?
[65:00.55]Oh, hell yeah.
[65:03.07]That's sick.
[65:08.61]That's sick.
[65:09.91]Let's get a big fish.
[65:22.44]Do bets.
[65:37.24]Um, you can get it done quickly.
[65:39.70]Yeah, do it.
[65:43.01]Place your bets.
[65:43.65]Will I do this in seven minutes or less?
[65:49.38]Seven minutes or less.
[66:03.95]No bets.
[66:04.35]Should we do no bets?
[66:06.21]Just go?
[66:06.75]No, this one's just free.
[66:10.57]Wait.
[66:11.05]Oh, you mean like actually free?
[66:16.26]Oh.
[66:18.02]Okay.
[66:26.05]You're still betting.
[66:33.21]Who is betting against this?
[66:34.49]25... Oh, guys.
[66:35.67]32 million versus... Versus how many?
[66:38.11]38 million versus 900,000.
[66:41.59]Interesting.
[66:46.22]I'll be back in 10 minutes.
[66:47.16]Take a quick break.
[66:48.72]Can you imagine...
[67:07.59]No, that was fun.
[67:11.21]Giant ancient core.
[67:12.73]These are important, I've been told.
[67:16.97]Cool.
[67:24.52]That was a pretty cool shrine.
[67:27.72]The staircase going up was a little challenging.
[67:31.06]Trying to get like one, two, three, four, five, you know, one foot in front of the other.
[67:34.02]It was kind of a challenge.
[67:38.19]Getting back down is another story though because that's gonna be a little harder.
[67:42.17]It's a little steeper You're a scammer I'm not a scammer that was it will be a scam for me to keep that pole in place
[68:17.49]So now I can just walk around.
[68:18.85]I'm going to go to the other ones.
[68:20.73]Yeah, bring me to the entrance.
[68:24.08]Do the Luddy?
[68:37.85]Nice armpits.
[68:39.21]I burn so much fuel.
[68:40.69]I don't think people just don't get this.
[68:48.21]I burn so much fuel.
[68:53.41]Inside, there's not a heart in here.
[68:55.55]There is this like engine just with like, just like smoke and steam.
[69:03.40]I'm just like a fucking engine that's constantly burning fluid and like fuel.
[69:21.45]I run so hot.
[69:24.47]I really am like a lizard.
[69:34.94]There's not a brain in there either apparently.
[69:38.83]Wow.
[69:39.93]You motherfucker.
[69:49.29]whoa that was wow that's rough that was rough I'll take that one I I just underhanded you a nerf ball okay test of wood need to equip the korok weapon set sure
[70:13.89]You have to keep the sword, bow, and shield equipped the whole time.
[70:16.84]If they break or you unequip them, I thought he said you die.
[70:43.38]I'm sorry!
[70:43.96]Oh my god, that hit right in the face!
[70:49.80]I didn't think- I thought it was just gonna phase through him!
[70:58.58]I'm so sad!
[70:59.44]I'm so sad!
[71:01.80]I didn't want to do that!
[71:02.56]Oh my goodness!
[71:07.74]Okay, I have enough for... Oh my god!
[71:16.93]I have enough for a shield.
[71:17.67]What about bow?
[71:19.23]I got to drop a bow, I think.
[71:20.29]Knight's bow, probably.
[71:24.13]Yeah, I'll drop this.
[71:27.98]I've been using it.
[71:42.13]I feel so bad.
[71:50.41]Drop the Frenic.
[71:52.41]Last time I wanted to drop the Frenic... Um... Everyone was like, don't do it, don't do it.
[71:58.14]It's like one of the best bows in the game.
[72:00.36]It's been sitting there the whole time.
[72:04.06]Go reach the shrine, but nothing can break.
[72:08.38]By the way, I just want to say I'm really sorry to you.
[72:11.20]I'm trying to apologize to him.
[72:14.10]I'm really sorry that I threw that at you.
[72:15.55]Okay.
[72:17.17]We're cool.
[72:30.24]Do I need to fight anything?
[72:31.36]Why don't I just run?
[72:32.86]I don't have to fight anything.
[72:40.27]Just make it to the shrine.
[73:08.49]What happened?
[73:08.89]I have to stay in the fence.
[73:12.35]Oh, I jumped the... That's why.
[73:13.77]Alright.
[73:14.83]Well, I'm gonna do this.
[73:19.38]I went out of bounds.
[73:20.32]Okay, I get it.
[73:23.02]I'll do it.
[73:35.49]It's fine.
[73:41.88]Okay, stay in the fence.
[74:00.74]Is this town of staying in the fence right here?
[74:18.09]Does this count?
[74:18.93]What the fuck just happened?
[74:20.83]That was scary.
[74:26.96]I can jump over this, right?
[74:29.28]I have to break these.
[74:32.75]Wait.
[74:54.79]Don't unequip.
[75:05.14]How do I?
[75:05.40]I don't want to shoot this.
[75:06.30]Whatever.
[75:08.06]Okay.
[75:09.62]This way.
[75:10.10]What the hell was that?
[75:23.43]I should probably heal.
[75:41.34]What?
[75:43.16]Just run?
[75:57.34]Why would you tell me to do that right now?
[76:02.37]What?
[76:02.91]Just run?
[76:04.09]Just run into the quicksand.
[76:06.65]Just, dude, what are you doing?
[76:08.01]Just run, run, just run.
[76:09.63]So I just run.
[76:11.27]You didn't say just run in the parentheses bracket.
[76:14.93]Watch out for the quicksand.
[76:16.31]You said run in all capitals.
[76:18.42]Run, run.
[76:19.06]So I did what you said.
[76:23.32]Jeremiah, I'm really high.
[76:24.46]Have you ever seen your side profile?
[76:27.39]I feel like you would look like a moon.
[76:36.67]What do you think?
[76:42.74]Dude, just run!
[76:43.58]Hurry up!
[76:44.04]What are you doing?
[76:44.60]Stop stalling!
[76:45.66]Run!
[76:46.14]Just run!
[76:47.00]Okay, I'm just gonna...
[76:54.26]I would have said if I was in the chat.
[76:56.58]Dude, run, but watch out ahead.
[76:59.50]It's a cautionary quicksand here.
[77:04.12]So how am I supposed to get through this?
[77:09.91]I'll have to make ice.
[77:12.13]Or will I have to kill some of these things?
[77:29.10]Hmm.
[77:34.14]What should I eat?
[77:35.28]How about just like... Yeah, I don't need... Whatever.
[77:37.52]I'll eat a roasted bass.
[77:40.58]And... An egg?
[77:44.37]No, that's... Not here.
[77:51.13]I mean, the chili fish skewer seems pretty good.
[77:57.25]Dude, watch out.
[77:57.99]Did somebody just say Wellington?
[78:01.77]Did you bring that back?
[78:06.80]Did somebody bring back the Wellington?
[78:08.24]Everyone hated that.
[78:08.98]I have to heal these things.
[78:20.15]This is so annoying.
[78:29.97]Alright, nice.
[78:32.98]We're good.
[78:33.68]I FREAKED OUT!
[78:34.84]I'm fine.
[78:55.46]Oh, you can have three.
[78:56.10]I thought you could only have two up at one time.
[78:59.70]Did that upgrade?
[79:00.50]I thought it was only two.
[79:11.45]It was three.
[79:12.11]It's always been three.
[79:12.77]Oh.
[79:12.87]I'm going to have to take another Tylenol.
[79:17.33]God damn it.
[79:19.75]Alright, no.
[79:20.35]I'm going to relax now.
[79:21.53]I'm going to chill.
[79:22.07]Like I said I was going to.
[79:43.29]I was like, what happened?
[79:44.94]I was trying to throw... I was trying to drop the stupid twig that I had equipped.
[79:51.04]I wasn't trying to unequip it.
[79:52.28]I was just trying to get rid of it.
[79:53.36]I should have just dropped it in my inventory.
[79:54.56]Whatever.
[79:54.90]I got... You relaxed way too hard.
[80:14.99]Okay.
[80:16.11]Jeremy, you need to run, but be cautious, for there is quicksand ahead.
[80:20.45]If you don't already know, quicksand is a dangerous and can quickly engulf Link and potentially give you a game over.
[80:25.98]I hope this information is found useful in your playthrough of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[80:30.32]Thanks.
[80:30.82]That's what I'm talking about.
[80:36.24]No, I... I'm going to drop that in the inventory.
[80:40.85]That counts, right?
[80:59.90]Okay.
[81:10.38]Jeremy, you should eat a slice of epic bacon.
[81:12.39]Oh.
[81:18.96]All right, drop this stupid thing.
[81:24.62]Drop that.
[81:25.50]What else do I don't want that is just clogging up my inventory?
[81:30.83]Like a huge turd.
[81:47.65]Why did you say that?
[81:48.47]I don't know.
[81:48.79]I have a headache today.
[81:59.82]That was fucking fucked up and gross.
[82:01.78]I don't care.
[82:03.10]Just don't.
[82:20.29]Oh, shit.
[82:38.01]It didn't jump when I hit the button.
[82:39.19]It didn't jump when I hit the button.
[82:40.51]It didn't jump when I hit the button.
[82:42.29]I swear to God, sometimes I will hit jump and the input will just not process because I'm on the wrong frame.
[82:49.31]Oh.
[82:58.15]It's like I hit the jump button, and it's like a frame that isn't done being rendered.
[83:03.06]So it's like, nope, you didn't... Actually, that is not a bad strategy, though.
[83:10.61]Get past this quick.
[83:29.53]Um... Do I have defense?
[83:32.21]Should, right?
[83:36.09]Yeah, I'm gonna do the defense boost.
[83:38.41]Let's do speed instead.
[83:41.47]Alright.
[83:54.18]Where's the fire guy?
[84:20.99]I promise you that, like, no human runs off an edge and doesn't press jump.
[84:28.06]I promise you.
[84:29.64]I promise you.
[84:30.46]I'm hitting the jump button.
[84:34.56]I'm telling you that's what's happening.
[84:37.72]Like, no human is like, oh, I'm going to put that there and just going to walk off the edge.
[84:42.37]No, I'm going to jump.
[84:55.60]No, we're doing it my way.
[85:00.16]You fucking idiot.
[85:02.61]It's just Mr. Bean episode every time I play Breath of the Wild, apparently.
[85:07.15]It's literally an episode of Mr. Bean.
[85:08.89]It's just, I'm Mr. Bean.
[85:24.32]I'm going... I don't care.
[85:35.39]What are you linking me?
[85:45.74]Change the armor?
[85:51.80]I... Okay.
[85:53.78]I am so flustered, you have no idea.
[85:55.64]I'm like... Somebody... I looked over here and somebody linked me like a big bird walking around on a stage and I... I'm fucking flustered as hell.
[86:04.16]Somebody... Me looking out of an airplane window or something?
[86:06.69]I don't know what's going on over here.
[86:13.17]Did you... Did you do Botox?
[86:14.69]No!
[86:15.07]Okay.
[86:18.59]Okay.
[86:22.21]I'm going to do it my way today.
[86:42.72]I'm going to change my armor.
[86:50.40]It's not that hard.
[86:51.22]No, it's not.
[86:52.62]I'm just distracted.
[86:55.27]Let's get the stuff with better defense.
[86:56.41]Yeah.
[87:02.20]Okay, we're doing this my way.
[87:31.62]I need arrows.
[87:39.52]I have no arrows.
[87:40.24]I do now.
[87:45.55]Like, what can I take?
[87:51.43]Take?
[87:52.49]Oh, arrow.
[87:52.91]Okay.
[88:03.87]I actually would rather attack these guys.
[88:05.73]Okay, that's exactly what I needed.
[88:53.10]I need to buy arrows.
[88:54.02]Oh, no, I don't.
[88:56.60]I am fucking furious.
[88:58.50]I already... Okay, here's the problem.
[89:00.26]I already beat this shit.
[89:02.70]But then I went into my inventory and scrolled to a different item and the game went, uh-uh-uh, you can't do that here.
[89:08.57]Uh-uh-uh.
[89:09.47]I wasn't trying to equip it.
[89:10.43]I was just trying to throw it away.
[89:12.09]Oh, my head hurts.
[89:34.92]What Oh
[90:01.08]I don't care if this fucking thing breaks.
[90:02.38]I'm not embarrassing myself for another 10 minutes.
[90:24.76]Get up there.
[90:25.72]Do you have any arrows up here?
[91:03.48]Swing the sword!
[91:04.76]I beat the last boss in Sekiro in like less than three hours.
[91:15.69]I don't care what anybody says.
[91:27.60]Okay, so there's nothing else shooting at me.
[91:30.36]There's nothing else attacking me.
[91:32.46]Right?
[91:33.22]We're good.
[91:33.58]Time to go.
[91:37.89]And I can dodge Battle Axe in real life.
[91:51.36]I can't just launch it back at him and kill him.
[91:54.56]You go down too quickly.
[92:07.81]Don't you dare!
[92:08.79]That person's not even shooting at me.
[92:15.16]Okay.
[92:18.20]I'm gonna block you.
[92:19.10]Good.
[92:21.15]Okay.
[92:27.93]OH SHIT!
[92:28.55]IT'S GONNA BREAK!
[92:32.31]STOP DOING THE MARIO!
[92:34.78]I'M SORRY!
[92:35.68]I'M SORRY EVERYBODY!
[92:36.94]I'M SO SORRY!
[92:38.00]I'M SO SORRY I WAS DOING THE MARIO THING!
[92:40.14]WHERE YOU JUMP BECAUSE YOU MAKE THE JUMP BUT THEN YOU FREAK OUT AND YOU JUMP BACKWARDS!
[92:43.92]AND THEN YOU FREAK OUT AND JUMP FORWARDS!
[92:46.03]I DID THE MARIO THING!
[92:57.03]You know what I mean?
[92:57.51]When you jump, you do a hard jump in Mario, and you don't have the confidence that you made it, so you freak out and press the button again, which makes you jump a second time, and then you are overcompensating going backwards.
[93:08.67]You know what I'm talking about.
[93:09.55]I did the Mario.
[93:16.10]The game is not respawning the enemies.
[93:17.92]I think I broke the actual game.
[93:20.92]I'm getting, yeah, no, nothing's respawning.
[93:31.38]I'm just going to shoot you.
[93:32.38]I don't care how far away this is.
[93:33.59]I don't care what kind of fucking arrow type it is.
[93:35.25]You have to die.
[93:38.01]You too over there.
[93:39.15]I'm not going to get embarrassed again.
[93:40.85]Go ahead.
[93:46.92]Do it.
[93:56.77]Get up.
[93:58.56]Why are you... All of a sudden, you don't want to get up now?
[94:01.81]Good.
[94:35.15]Where are you?
[95:07.73]right there.
[95:08.07]I don't care how expensive these things are.
[95:18.57]It's worth it.
[95:20.43]There are a couple.
[95:20.96]Look, they're in the ground over here.
[95:21.90]See?
[95:23.30]I can see them right there.
[95:24.24]There's one here and there's one here.
[95:25.76]How come I can't kill them?
[95:27.90]Oh, those are just twigs.
[95:28.96]I'm fine.
[95:30.92]What's this for?
[95:36.70]Did I just fuck it up?
[95:42.72]Let's see what's going on here.
[95:46.78]Ow.
[96:01.47]People are gonna think I'm so nuts for this, but I don't care.
[96:08.69]I could have just made the jump, right?
[96:13.66]No, I don't care.
[96:14.84]Is it gonna teleport?
[96:15.44]If I skip it is gonna be mad at me?
[96:23.46]Is it gonna be pissed off if I do this?
[96:28.25]I'm not gonna get disqualified if I do this, right?
[96:39.34]I made it.
[96:39.74]Oh my god.
[96:40.52]Thank goodness I can finally... Oh my god.
[96:46.36]That was so... It should not have been like that.
[96:48.50]It just shouldn't have been like that.
[96:52.91]It shouldn't have been like that.
[97:02.21]I don't ever want to do that again.
[97:03.81]In fact, I want to delete that from my memory.
[97:12.25]It was fun, whatever.
[97:18.84]I got one more trial.
[97:25.68]What was the last one?
[97:43.72]Yeah, I think these are reward-only shrines, yeah.
[97:47.02]Cool.
[97:57.57]I have... This would be number six for orbs.
[98:04.13]Did you drop the game to a 9.8?
[98:07.51]No, it's still a 9.
[98:08.44]Well, it's... It's a 9-something.
[98:15.25]So far.
[98:24.17]It's a 9-something.
[98:26.11]It's definitely higher than a 9.1.
[98:28.37]It's definitely lower than a 9.9.
[98:29.38]Do you guys remember when I gave the Outer Wilds an 8.9?
[98:38.64]And everybody hated me for like a week?
[98:56.64]Alright, let's go back to the beginning.
[98:57.54]And look how long that took.
[99:10.57]Just teleport out?
[99:11.53]I just did.
[99:24.22]Alright, the final trial of...
[99:27.85]What's the name of this village?
[99:32.87]What is it?
[99:41.86]Mr. Hero.
[99:42.70]Hey, are you the hero?
[99:43.52]Could it be?
[99:43.96]Welcome to Korok Forest.
[99:46.92]You're much cooler looking than I thought you'd be.
[99:48.81]Hey, thank you.
[99:50.49]But to be sure you're up to the task, I prepared a trial.
[99:53.11]What do you think?
[99:53.63]Will you accept my trial?
[99:54.67]Yes.
[99:55.91]Show me a rod with the power of ice, please.
[99:58.77]You can wave this rod to freeze monsters in their tracks.
[100:01.62]Ice wizrobes love to... Oh, I have one of those.
[100:07.36]I have one of those.
[100:07.78]Look what I got.
[100:10.00]That's not what he wants?
[100:21.34]This is an ice rod, isn't it?
[100:23.54]This doesn't count?
[100:25.11]Is it- oh, it's the- it's the wand.
[100:26.77]Okay.
[100:27.43]Not- I guess- okay.
[100:28.67]I thought it had to just be like an ice weapon.
[100:32.91]Alright, let's do the final trial.
[100:46.74]The little wand thing.
[100:47.56]Okay, cool.
[100:50.39]This game is so fun, though.
[100:53.67]You know what?
[100:54.03]Okay.
[100:54.71]I'm gonna make a... I'm going to make an Elden Ring comparison, because that's what I'm going to do.
[100:58.73]So all the people that want to block your ears right now, go for it.
[101:01.60]But... I like how in Breath of the Wild, there's just a bunch of random shit to do.
[101:09.06]Just a bunch of random shit everywhere.
[101:11.56]And it's not stupid shit.
[101:14.65]There's a lot of big open world games.
[101:17.09]They say, we got all this stuff to do, right?
[101:20.54]This is like handcrafted stuff to do.
[101:23.80]Like this is here, right?
[101:25.38]This is here.
[101:27.08]So they like made this completely unique to this area.
[101:32.93]It's great.
[101:38.87]I feel the same way about the Elden Ring was the same way where every single spot, all the missions and all the quests felt like somebody's like handmade it.
[101:48.13]It wasn't just like, oh, we have this thing we can put here and this thing we can put here.
[101:50.61]It was like, oh no, you're making this area.
[101:52.35]You're going to hand make this area.
[101:56.99]What's wrong?
[101:58.31]I told you to stop scaring me.
[102:02.73]What's going on?
[102:03.17]I have to go back.
[102:10.27]Oh, okay.
[102:12.67]I'm ready for the trial.
[102:13.47]Yes, I am.
[102:15.61]My little Oki just now set off to do the trial.
[102:19.37]Normally I'd go along too, but Oki insisted on going alone.
[102:22.04]I let Oki go, but well, I'm just getting worried.
[102:24.14]Could you please follow Oki without being seen?
[102:27.14]I want to make sure nothing happens.
[102:28.26]He's right there.
[102:29.12]Look over there.
[102:34.00]So just make sure nothing bad happens.
[102:35.66]This is an escort quest.
[102:38.52]And don't get seen.
[102:49.28]what are you talking about all right I have to crouch I have to crouch
[103:20.45]All right, go on, do what you're going to do.
[103:25.23]I need like a GTA mission line above his head.
[103:29.38]When it fills up, I lose.
[103:55.95]Shit, where'd he go?
[104:12.55]Where'd he go?
[104:14.91]Where'd he go?
[104:15.33]Oh, there you are.
[105:16.22]Don't I have a stealth thing?
[105:21.11]Speed, speed, where's stealth?
[105:24.17]It's the purple one?
[105:27.47]Okay.
[105:27.69]Let's eat this.
[105:51.17]What are you, coming over here?
[105:52.39]Don't look over here.
[106:18.41]You know, escort quests I think could do with a little bit of kind of reimagining.
[106:22.79]How much more fun would this be if it was like, oh yeah, by the way, he's really reckless.
[106:28.26]And instead of just the walk behind the person, it was they were sprinting through and aggroing the entire forest.
[106:36.08]Like they just aggro everything.
[106:38.14]And it's just chaos.
[106:49.92]Do you guys remember a Warcraft reference?
[106:52.05]Here it comes.
[106:52.63]Remember in Warcraft, you'd do the escort quest, and you'd get attacked by like five people, and the escort would sprint way out of the way to fight, and then after the big fight was done, they would run all the way back to where they were currently walking from?
[107:08.23]Hey!
[107:17.65]They would walk, run all the way back to where they were walking from and then start slowly going again.
[107:24.70]Like, the game did not, their AI did not allow them to go further unless they were walking the exact path they had to walk.
[107:32.66]What are you doing?
[107:39.29]What are you doing?
[108:01.10]Get out of the fucking way.
[108:06.39]What happened?
[108:07.03]Hey!
[108:07.71]What's going on?
[108:12.79]Don't do this to me now.
[108:14.17]I'm in the middle of something.
[108:36.51]What are we doing right now?
[108:47.07]There's just a shadow.
[108:47.93]I'm not fucking around.
[109:03.05]I don't care if it's too long.
[109:27.20]are you turning around what are you doing are you walking forward I can't tell you're just a blob
[109:56.14]Don't walk into the fire.
[109:57.43]Okay.
[110:26.27]Where'd he go?
[110:27.07]Where'd he go?
[110:27.43]Where is he?
[110:27.89]Where'd he go?
[110:28.53]Where is he?
[110:28.95]I don't see him.
[110:32.38]I don't... Where'd he go?
[110:33.42]I actually don't know where he is.
[110:34.68]Where is he?
[110:35.14]I don't see him at all.
[110:35.90]I don't see him.
[110:36.34]I don't see him.
[110:37.82]Where is he?
[110:38.26]Where is he?
[110:38.64]I actually... I'm serious.
[110:39.46]I don't know where he is.
[110:44.67]Which way?
[110:45.03]Which way?
[110:45.35]Which... I don't... I can't... I'm serious.
[110:47.23]Where is he?
[110:51.77]Right?
[110:52.23]I didn't see where he went.
[111:01.41]Oh, there he is.
[111:01.79]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[111:13.24]Thank God.
[111:13.66]Alright.
[111:14.06]Did something weird happen here?
[111:15.41]I made it.
[111:20.89]Yep.
[111:22.05]You did.
[111:29.84]We good?
[111:33.12]Can I go and talk to him now?
[111:42.44]You did it!
[111:42.86]Nice job!
[111:47.30]Guess what, Mr. Hero?
[111:48.10]I did the trial by myself.
[111:49.22]Aren't I brave?
[111:49.86]You're probably here for the shrine.
[111:52.66]The Great Deku Tree said that the Monk's Blessing is waiting in the shrine ahead.
[111:55.43]Why don't you go take a look?
[111:57.37]Nice job!
[111:57.79]You did it!
[111:59.09]Nice work.
[112:01.01]You did the trial.
[112:04.98]Aw.
[112:05.92]They did it.
[112:08.90]Nice.
[112:16.03]Cool.
[112:20.35]Alright.
[112:21.65]I did all the forest.
[112:22.73]Or at least the shrine stuff.
[112:24.41]Do I get anything for doing all of it?
[112:40.53]Yeah, imagine this is like a bomb is going, like an explosion goes off next to you.
[112:46.24]You're like, oh, what was that?
[112:47.26]I didn't have to, I just shot an arrow.
[112:57.70]Ancient core.
[112:59.24]Cool.
[113:02.64]Yeah, so what's the, is there a, you did all three trials?
[113:05.01]Do I get anything?
[113:16.82]Go upgrade your stasis.
[113:21.16]Is that from the village?
[113:27.43]You look like you had plastic surgery.
[113:28.77]I... I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
[113:40.38]I love how you say this guy, but you've been a sub for like three months at least.
[113:45.74]You know who I am.
[113:47.30]You know what, you're here and you're here.
[113:50.36]Hey dude, this guy.
[113:55.53]You know who I am.
[113:58.49]You're hanging out here.
[113:59.53]All right, let's turn it in.
[114:14.45]Celebrity meltdown.
[114:20.31]Welcome back to Celebrity Meltdown.
[114:23.91]FunnyManStreamerJerma985 had a little bit of a problem in the Lost Forest in Breath of the Wild.
[114:33.59]Could not quite figure out that trial.
[114:38.28]Our sources say that after the stream ended, Mr. Albertson actually took a bite out of his drywall.
[114:46.02]And then had to go to the dentist shortly after.
[114:51.77]Alright, what do I get?
[114:52.35]It's only a matter of time before you're able to pull the Master Sword.
[115:02.98]Okay.
[115:22.88]This is an Omega Truffle.
[115:28.14]Cool.
[115:30.03]That was fun.
[115:34.27]I want to go... I need to upgrade my health.
[115:37.81]Is there one of those shrine things in this town?
[115:40.53]I'm going to have to go back to the village.
[115:44.97]It's in the tree.
[115:52.96]This one inside.
[115:53.64]Because I have enough to do... I'll do health.
[115:57.25]I did stamina twice.
[115:58.45]Where is it?
[116:04.83]Where is it?
[116:08.78]Sleep in the bed.
[116:13.10]Oh.
[116:14.72]Okay.
[116:18.14]I want to do a heart container.
[116:19.14]Thank you.
[116:35.87]Cool.
[116:41.33]Now, somebody said you can upgrade the stasis.
[116:44.39]Where do I do that?
[116:47.25]Have you finished the game?
[116:48.31]No, not even close.
[116:49.05]I don't think I'm even at the halfway point.
[116:51.57]I have one guardian down.
[116:53.63]I'm about to do the second guardian in the lab.
[116:57.02]That was... Where was that?
[117:05.11]Where's that lab?
[117:05.96]I feel like it was up.
[117:15.37]Wasn't it up?
[117:17.01]It's in the bottom.
[117:18.71]Oh, okay.
[117:34.10]Still think I can't dodge a battle axe after hearing that.
[117:55.15]Alright.
[117:55.97]Let's go.
[117:56.59]Alright.
[117:57.19]In here.
[117:57.45]I'll just talk to you.
[118:04.48]Good morning.
[118:05.66]Did you bring me any ancient materials?
[118:09.77]Yes.
[118:11.47]Which rune do you want to power up?
[118:13.90]Stasis.
[118:16.20]Three ancient cores.
[118:18.08]Yes.
[118:40.83]Thank you.
[118:49.15]Charging your phone.
[118:54.44]I like this little iPad.
[118:55.40]I like it.
[118:59.32]Powered up stasis rune can now time stop evil creatures.
[119:04.99]The stored energy will act upon the object when the flow of time... Wait, I can freeze people now?
[119:11.62]That seems kind of good.
[119:14.34]Seems really good.
[119:25.07]What's this?
[119:26.19]Perhaps you already went and powered them all up?
[119:27.85]Suppose your Sheikah Slate and your legendary swordsmanship have... We have nothing to fear.
[119:33.43]Nothing at all.
[119:34.67]Calamity Ganon.
[119:42.22]Alright.
[119:49.48]So... I think I'm gonna take a little BRB here.
[119:54.08]There's our couple of hours of Breath of the Wild.
[119:57.18]Gonna move on to... Let's hear it.
[120:01.00]I want everyone to say ALL CAPITALS.
[120:03.18]What are we moving on to?

[120:21.74]We're going to play Gotham Knights Sponsored.
[120:25.16]This is the last stream of Gotham Knights you'll see that's sponsored.
[120:29.93]For the culmination of the last three days.
[120:34.03]Um...

[121:01.11]The next time you will see me live will be on... Hmm.
[121:10.94]This is interesting.
[121:12.26]Probably... I will be live for a short stream on the 20th.
[121:21.80]Well, I'm still streaming.
[121:23.86]I'll be back on the 25th in the afternoon.
[121:28.55]I'll give you one second.
[121:29.20]I'll be right back.
[121:29.60]We're going to play Gotham Knights for a couple of hours.

[121:41.02]So... We'll see.
[121:44.24]I'm going to take a break.
[121:44.90]I'll be right back.
[121:46.97]No one cares about your eyeball.
[121:48.23]I care about my eyeball.

[121:51.61]But yeah, once, um, once I'm back, uh, in the last kind of, this last kind of area of October, like the 29th, 30th, and 31st, we're gonna do a ton of Halloween shit.
[122:03.86]So, be right back.
[122:06.78]Give me two, three minutes.
