[ve:61.1.100]

[01:08.18]What's up?
[01:12.50]My audio is screwed up.
[01:13.46]I don't know what the hell's going on.
[01:16.74]Anytime I open Marvel Rivals, my computer just freaks out.
[01:21.55]But I have since solved it.
[01:24.53]I have a temporary solution.
[01:27.83]And that temporary solution is going to be, unfortunately, temporarily annoying for everybody here.
[01:38.12]You actually might not even hear it.
[01:41.40]I have to play the game through external speakers.
[01:45.86]I don't have headphones right now.
[01:46.86]You're going to play... Yes.
[01:53.89]Okay, my plan today is I want to play a little bit of Rivals.
[02:00.51]I've seen a lot about this game.
[02:02.15]I've seen a lot of people play it.
[02:03.37]I've played it.
[02:05.67]I want to get wicked good.
[02:09.51]They're at least good enough to look over in chat.
[02:12.54]The best part about being a bad gamer is when I do something, like for instance, if I get one kill, if I just get one elimination, even if it's not even that impressive, I'll look over here and I'll seek PogChamps.
[02:29.04]I'd be like, oh shit, everyone's going crazy.
[02:31.53]You just got that one elimination.
[02:33.39]I can't wait.
[02:33.85]It's the best part about being a terrible gamer.
[02:37.69]When you do anything, it's spectacular.
[02:39.51]Yeah, and then I want to play Infinity Nikki.
[02:49.88]I don't know.
[02:50.46]Look, I don't know if we're going to get to it.
[02:53.14]I just have to keep... All I have to do is just keep saying that.
[02:57.64]And I don't ever have to play it.
[02:59.82]I'm not sure we're going to get to it.
[03:02.65]I want to play Marvel Rivals, you know?
[03:04.41]I'm not sure we're going to get to it.
[03:15.53]Let's go, Infinity Nikki.
[03:16.96]Yeah, but I want to play Rivals.
[03:25.40]Rivals to me is like, man, this is kind of popping off a little.
[03:32.37]I'm a bandwagon gamer.
[03:34.69]I see something popular, I just jump on it.
[03:38.40]No, that's absolutely not true.
[03:39.76]What is true is that Venom is in this game.
[03:43.18]And I think he's cool.
[03:45.18]And just wait to see this fucking Venom gameplay you're going to get right now.
[03:55.63]Are you guys ready?
[03:56.25]I'm just ready to play.
[03:57.07]I just want to play.
[03:58.93]I'm going to play the game and hang out in chill mood.
[04:02.63]You should play this game with Ster.
[04:04.07]And I figured that I've watched her play a lot of this.
[04:05.97]I figured that was going to come up.
[04:07.89]And of course, I would love to play with my friend Ster.
[04:10.51]There's only one problem that I have with that.
[04:13.38]Doesn't he have like 1000 games under his belt already?
[04:17.26]And he's highly ranked.
[04:18.36]I'm not getting dragged in to the high elo match and go 0 and 15.
[04:23.06]I'm not doing that.
[04:24.26]I'm not going 2 and 15 every single time I play the game with Ster.
[04:33.00]I mean, we'll see.
[04:37.16]Only 15?
[04:38.72]You're afraid he's going to show you up.
[04:42.52]I'm not afraid about it.
[04:43.99]I am certain about it.
[04:45.11]I am 100% certain about it.
[04:52.23]Let's just play some games and chill.
[04:54.49]I turned on like all the streamer shit.
[04:56.65]I don't know.
[04:58.04]My character's name is Player480.
[05:00.04]That's not my name.
[05:02.12]My name sucks and I hate it.
[05:04.34]And you're going to have to find it by watching me play the game.
[05:10.33]It's such a bad username.
[05:12.15]I just didn't care.
[05:13.13]I couldn't think of anything interesting.
[05:14.29]I was like, you know what?
[05:14.79]I don't give a shit.
[05:18.53]Player480.
[05:19.19]Player480.
[05:21.48]Okay, so let's go.
[05:23.24]I don't know why I'm trying to put my headphones in.
[05:26.16]Those don't do anything.
[05:27.70]This is going to feel weird.
[05:28.50]This is the first time I think I've ever played a game on stream and I didn't have a headphone in.
[05:33.80]You should sing the Marvel Rivals song.
[05:39.90]I don't think one exists.
[05:45.62]And stop telling me to sing songs.
[05:49.52]Not everything has to have a song attached to it, okay?
[05:52.32]We could have individual things.
[05:56.73]Not everything has to have a bonus track on it, okay?
[06:00.34]It's Marvel Rivals.
[06:05.18]OK, you guys good?
[06:06.58]I like venom.
[06:09.14]I'm just going to be doing quick mode or quick match whatever I might do practice on a couple people to the because I hey hey.
[06:16.42]Mr Fantastic and Invisible Woman are both out today.
[06:20.38]I heard about that.
[06:21.16]I did look at it.
[06:24.25]You should do a Jeff impression.
[06:26.85]No.
[06:30.23]What about venom?
[06:30.89]Alright, you guys ready?
[06:31.57]Let's let's get some shit gameplay going.
[06:33.45]How does that sound?
[06:39.92]Let's get some dog shit gameplay.
[06:43.84]I hope you guys can hear this.
[06:45.98]Hey, yes, you can.
[06:46.70]It might be a little loud.
[06:47.46]I'm going to turn it down for now because you guys are going to have to tell me if it's too loud.
[06:52.43]I might need to change my keybinds, but alright.
[06:55.67]I didn't choose this character.
[06:59.17]Please sing the Venom song.
[07:00.59]Now that one does have a song.
[07:04.72]That one actually has a song, but I'm not going to sing it.
[07:06.88]I don't even know the words.
[07:12.30]Oh, I have a queue delay.
[07:14.20]Alright.
[07:14.76]I'm a streamer.
[07:15.44]I got a queue delay, man.
[07:17.92]How many of you guys just like... Some of you guys just clicked that so fast.
[07:22.56]It was like Bale just died in Hell difficulty.
[07:25.15]I know it.
[07:26.13]I know.
[07:26.45]I just clicked that button.
[07:27.15]How many of you just fucking spammed it?
[07:30.07]It's like you just saw gold letters drop on the ground after killing Bale.
[07:32.41]Alright, let's do Venom.
[07:36.99]Uh...
[07:38.55]I'm going to turn it off for me.
[07:39.27]Alright, if you can hear this through my monitor, then I'm sorry, but I need to be able to hear the fucking video game.
[07:46.35]I don't think you should be able to.
[07:52.54]Just pretend it's a stream from like 2012.
[07:58.20]Turn him around.
[08:00.91]I can't, I have no access.
[08:04.27]Alright, how Venom works.
[08:05.83]Venom is a bruiser.
[08:07.91]That's not what it's called in this game.
[08:09.33]It's called Vanguard in this game.
[08:11.65]This wants me to check my ability details.
[08:13.21]I already know how this character kind of works a little.
[08:16.62]Let me just make sure my keybinds are correct.
[08:18.22]They are not.
[08:19.32]That needs to be changed immediately.
[08:25.36]I need to switch two things.
[08:27.63]Okay, hold on a second here.
[08:32.49]It would be... What is five right now?
[08:34.79]Okay, this needs to switch.
[08:36.41]Got it?
[08:37.01]Good?
[08:38.65]Okay, now watch this Venom gameplay.
[08:40.15]I don't even know how to play the game.
[08:42.01]I'm just kidding.
[08:42.39]I don't know what to do.
[08:43.51]What do I do?
[08:44.60]What do I do?
[08:45.00]What do I do?
[08:46.68]What do I do?
[08:48.04]What do I do?
[08:49.34]Okay, that left click is attack.
[08:50.48]Left click is hurt other person.
[08:51.76]Okay.
[09:07.58]What do I do?
[09:20.34]Alright.
[09:20.64]He turns back into Bruce.
[09:24.57]Alright.
[09:24.77]Get out.
[09:24.95]Get out.
[09:25.29]Get out.
[09:25.47]Get out.
[09:25.67]Get out.
[09:25.87]Get out.
[09:26.05]Get out.
[09:27.03]Get out.
[09:28.19]Yeah!
[09:28.79]That's how you get it done.
[09:30.61]This is level one.
[09:36.85]Play Groot?
[09:38.53]I don't want to- hold on.
[09:46.88]Venom, gotta get that venom, venom, gotta get that adrenaline venom.
[09:51.58]I- okay, I sang the song very cringely.
[09:53.29]Um, that'll be a thousand dollars please.
[10:16.12]Alright, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[10:17.30]Wait, wait.
[10:17.94]Yep.
[10:18.86]We're good.
[10:21.99]Kill that Hawkeye.
[10:23.41]Wait, did they nerf Hawkeye?
[10:24.43]Hawkeye got nerfed, right?
[10:27.67]I can't believe I did.
[10:30.19]Yeah, Hawkeye got like a huge nerf apparently.
[10:31.77]What am I doing so far?
[10:34.71]Okay.
[10:36.91]Alright, this is whatever.
[10:42.63]You can also climb on the walls.
[10:43.67]We haven't gotten that far yet for me.
[10:48.89]I just know how to do this.
[10:49.55]It gets you across the map very quickly.
[10:54.21]You're supposed to kind of go behind people.
[10:55.39]Okay, Venom is a tank.
[10:56.96]If you didn't know.
[10:57.46]Just got to hold this for two minutes.
[11:10.43]It doesn't look like it.
[11:12.26]Well, it's tanks are kind of weird in this game because some tanks I just play like they're just DPS and then everybody I look in the chat and I keep seeing like fucking idiot fucking idiot like please get me out of this game with this dude player 480.
[11:47.83]I need heals, need healing, help me.
[11:51.63]Turn auto swing off?
[11:53.07]What do you mean turn auto swing off?
[11:54.73]How does that work?
[11:56.10]There's an auto swing?
[11:57.74]This looks like an E3 trailer.
[11:59.22]You know it doesn't.
[12:01.36]An E3 trailer would be operating so much smoother than this.
[12:06.17]I'm 8 and 2 right now.
[12:07.49]It's not like I did anything wrong.
[12:10.13]Go in the settings.
[12:10.77]What if I like the auto swing though?
[12:12.27]It helps.
[12:27.04]I don't need the auto swing off.
[12:30.02]Also, is it weird to me that anytime I see a Hulk, there's a Hulk in this game, it's always a nine-year-old boy.
[12:36.84]Like, every time.
[12:38.07]Like, this is a nine-year-old boy.
[12:40.35]Like, I just see a little kid playing this game.
[12:50.33]know what it is about the hulk in particular but the hulk just kind of is every time I see the hulk with those purple shorts I'm just like that's a that's a that's probably a little kid like I love the incredible help where are your healers um no we have them
[13:20.30]No, do not knock me back.
[13:22.31]Oh, I didn't activate my shield.
[13:23.53]I'm an idiot.
[13:24.33]At least I killed the healer.
[13:28.19]This is a really slow match.
[13:29.63]The slowest match I think I've ever seen.
[13:31.97]Dude, this is literally like the first game I've played on this.
[13:39.44]Guys, all of the people in this game installed the game for their birthday an hour ago.
[13:43.44]Okay, like we're all just trying to get through this.
[14:02.45]Give me the Penta!
[14:09.75]Get on the cart.
[14:26.17]I love doing the dive.
[14:26.99]Alright, I'm out.
[14:28.61]I'm out.
[14:29.03]I'm out.
[14:29.45]I'm out.
[14:29.90]I keep forgetting to do the right click.
[14:30.98]I'm an idiot.
[14:34.81]The boogers just blew all over my face because of that.
[14:40.92]If I get killed by Bruce Banner, I'm going to uninstall the game.
[14:44.24]Okay, thank God.
[14:44.82]I need something here.
[14:53.52]I'm going to go heals next.
[15:03.42]I love hiding like this and just like being right next to my God.
[15:08.35]I'm going to die here, but it's OK.
[15:18.07]I'm not going to die here.
[15:18.93]Apparently I still like.
[15:21.97]This is too loud.
[15:24.39]I turned on.
[15:34.65]Folks.
[15:38.18]Volume's good.
[15:38.72]Okay.
[15:43.22]I'm 17 and 5 right now.
[15:44.58]These numbers are going to get much more normalized every one to two games that are played.
[15:51.51]You should put the music on.
[15:52.51]Do I not have the music up?
[16:04.79]Why are you so bad?
[16:06.81]I got this game for my birthday 45 minutes ago.
[16:08.39]See if I can get... Yeah!
[16:16.75]Sorry.
[16:22.01]That was such an old guy scream.
[16:24.21]I just tried to yell, yeah.
[16:26.43]I'm getting old.
[16:29.26]Yeah!
[16:32.88]What the fuck?
[16:40.97]Don't let him on it.
[16:46.56]Nobody.
[16:51.58]Oh, what just happened to me?
[16:58.98]You might be playing with console players.
[17:00.62]I probably am.
[17:02.04]I am a console player.
[17:07.17]I also I played Adam Warlock too.
[17:08.59]He was fun.
[17:35.98]I have no idea what's going on.
[17:38.82]Why are you also playing this?
[17:40.70]Why does this look fun?
[17:42.24]I don't know.
[17:44.20]Like a hero shooter with the Marvel characters?
[17:49.84]As much as I've not cared at all about the last, let's call it three to four years of Marvel television or even the movies necessarily.
[17:59.47]I'm an old Marvel comic book kind of guy.
[18:02.65]When I was like 15, 14, 16.
[18:04.61]I love, I had like a bunch of, I had the comic book, I had Venom comic books and shit.
[18:09.90]I loved this.
[18:10.62]I don't give a fuck about the movies and TV shows.
[18:14.16]I mean, they're cool.
[18:16.24]I enjoyed them.
[18:17.34]But at the very end of the day, it's the character that has the real weight to it.
[18:20.79]You know what I mean?
[18:38.80]Movies are bad, but the game is good.
[18:41.54]I haven't really watched a single Marvel property since probably I want to say Endgame, maybe a little bit after Endgame.
[18:50.77]After Endgame, everybody kind of collectively was like, man, this is going to be so sick.
[18:53.99]I can't wait.
[18:54.59]That was a big conclusion.
[18:56.87]Now what?
[19:01.55]I think it's kind of been sort of in the now what stage after the Avengers stuff.
[19:11.14]kill this thing!
[19:23.29]Alright, I have a question for all you Venom players out there.
[19:33.41]Is there ever a reason to use the regular actual melee attack?
[19:39.50]Where am I going here?
[19:41.02]I'm at that spawn.
[19:41.78]This is a bad idea.
[19:42.74]How am I still alive?
[19:43.22]I have two health.
[19:43.76]Wait, who is this bird?
[19:54.34]Who is the bird?
[19:58.88]Cool, okay.
[19:59.72]That was a warm up.
[20:04.94]Dude, player 480 is the MVP?
[20:07.16]No way.
[20:19.15]nice here's okay here's the cool thing about uh Marvel rivals I don't know if Overwatch or valorant I don't know you even put this in the same category I don't know I don't know anything about video games besides the fact that they're fun to play uh you can click on everybody in your lobby and see their a highlight that they had you can click on anybody
[20:47.00]I don't know if that's in the other games, but it's cool.
[20:56.95]They also have the two different MVPs.
[20:58.65]They have the winning team MVP and then the losing team MVP.
[21:07.25]Oh, but I asked the question, okay, should I...
[21:14.18]Uh, what was I gonna ask?
[21:16.44]Uh, about Venom?
[21:17.14]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:18.14]The melee move.
[21:19.46]Venom's melee attack?
[21:21.44]Is the melee attack ever really worth doing?
[21:25.35]I'm talking the standard default pressing V on your keyboard.
[21:30.55]Sometimes.
[21:31.11]Okay.
[21:33.57]It's fast.
[21:34.47]It goes through shield.
[21:35.31]You should combo with it.
[21:37.34]It's useless.
[21:38.78]It ignores shields.
[21:39.84]Okay.
[21:48.83]You should play Mr. Fantastic.
[21:53.97]I'll try it.
[22:00.75]Left click with melee at the same time.
[22:03.72]Can you do them at the same time?
[22:06.74]If that's the case, I'm going to have to change that button because pressing V is... I don't know.
[22:10.80]It's always kind of awkward.
[22:14.82]You kind of remind me of Jeff.
[22:25.18]It goes through shields, but it has baby damage.
[22:27.56]Okay.
[22:29.32]That's good to know.
[22:42.08]I like watching.
[22:42.82]I'm watching you because I can hear the smile in your voice sometimes.
[22:46.94]Okay.
[22:48.16]Let's do a test.
[22:51.25]Am I smiling right now?
[22:55.04]Am I smiling right now?
[22:57.94]Am I smiling right now?
[23:00.54]Am I smiling right now?
[23:02.32]Which one of those?
[23:05.16]Uh, I'll play... I'll play Adam Warlock.
[23:10.65]The first one, definitely.
[23:11.61]One and four.
[23:12.15]Yeah, you got it.
[23:12.85]Wow.
[23:13.63]Alright, Adam Warlock is cool.
[23:15.53]I know a lot of you already played this game, already know this game exists, but some of you probably don't.
[23:21.59]He's got a heal.
[23:22.59]It's just a chain heal.
[23:24.99]And then he has a chain heal dot that makes it so... Oh, no, no.
[23:29.07]Hot.
[23:29.37]Sorry.
[23:34.23]He's fun to play.
[23:35.59]He also has a revive.
[23:40.80]Oh, man.
[23:41.58]Oh, no!
[23:43.38]I turned the corner at the last possible.
[23:45.00]Sorry.
[23:52.37]I would love to be good at this game.
[23:55.21]Oh, when you die, you don't actually die.
[23:56.48]Forget about that.
[24:02.46]Cooldown is what?
[24:03.44]One minute?
[24:03.76]Two minutes?
[24:05.30]Who the hell am I?
[24:08.00]Where am I going?
[24:09.70]You just died to a bot.
[24:11.04]No, I didn't.
[24:25.20]Alright, where did you get in there?
[24:27.19]I got you.
[24:31.49]Got you fly up there.
[24:33.43]Help me, help me, help me.
[24:34.70]I have a voice chat turned off.
[24:36.58]What am I even doing?
[24:38.74]Dude, he just fucking Gumby'd me.
[24:51.12]Stay behind your team and heal.
[24:52.80]Yeah, I don't even know what... How did I end up over there?
[24:57.96]I ended up behind the whole thing.
[24:59.28]I was just talking, just walking in a direction.
[25:10.43]What team am I even on?
[25:11.67]Okay, I'm on the attacking team.
[25:15.96]Am I red?
[25:20.82]What team am I on?
[25:26.76]I'm on the defending team.
[25:28.74]Okay, this is what's freaking me out.
[25:30.52]Blue and red are always... Wait, what?
[25:39.16]So we're on team blue, but we're defending like a team red.
[25:43.82]I get it.
[25:44.14]I can't kill you.
[26:01.57]Oh, be careful!
[26:05.35]Whoa, something killed me instantly.
[26:11.49]Leave me alone!
[26:12.11]Fuck you, I'll just die then.
[26:18.94]You don't get anything.
[26:29.53]That's actually kind of a funny strategy.
[26:31.19]People are just waiting for the free kill and you just leave.
[26:37.95]That's funny.
[26:38.35]Alright, I gotta remember that because I will chase Adam Warlock.
[26:43.36]Forever.
[26:47.88]How far does a revive go?
[27:20.05]Alright, get on it.
[27:24.01]I can do it.
[27:24.41]I can do this.
[27:27.71]Epic.
[27:29.23]What happened?
[27:30.17]Oh.
[27:31.79]Stay alive.
[27:32.11]I'll be back.
[27:40.73]I didn't know if I was close enough to the old.
[27:42.27]I guess that was far.
[27:42.97]60 feet is always so deceiving in video games.
[27:45.97]It could either be 100 miles looking or it could be right in front of you.
[27:49.77]Ugh.
[28:00.97]You saved everybody was worth it.
[28:12.95]This is not Nikki.
[28:16.37]Not.
[28:28.81]When are you going to play Hearthstone Battlegrounds?
[28:31.01]That's never happening ever.
[28:32.05]Okay, I need to get at least like 5,000 to 10,000 healing.
[28:34.05]I gotta, come on.
[28:34.99]What is this?
[28:35.38]Everyone's already dead by the time I get over here.
[28:49.72]Okay, so they just breached the threshold.
[28:51.75]Alright, so it just has to breach the threshold to lose.
[28:53.61]I thought the whole thing had to get over there.
[29:07.50]Turn voice chat on to act like the character.
[29:11.68]I think I would rather not annoy every single person in the lobby.
[29:18.57]That was quick.
[29:19.67]It was.
[29:21.45]That's why they're called quick match.
[29:26.83]No, I'm not doing that.
[29:27.81]I don't want to be the annoying guy.
[29:29.27]I don't want to just be like, hey, it's me, Adam Warlock.
[29:33.65]I don't know what movie he's from.
[29:35.95]Guardians?
[29:49.02]No, I'm not turning on voice chat.
[29:56.44]Going back to Venom?
[29:57.36]Either back to Venom or...
[30:00.20]I don't know.
[30:00.62]We should play.
[30:01.42]I can play Hulk too.
[30:03.40]Hulk is kind of fun.
[30:04.16]I'll play Venom.
[30:04.72]I like Venom.
[30:08.52]Try Captain America.
[30:09.28]He got buffed personally, didn't he?
[30:47.01]I like doing this.
[30:49.57]No, no, I don't play yet.
[30:55.29]Fine.
[31:02.10]Let's have another game like we have with the last Venom game, right?
[31:11.70]Shit.
[31:25.01]Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready?
[31:28.05]In 3, 2, 1.
[31:40.05]Oops, nobody chase me please.
[31:41.05]Nobody come get me I'm so hard to kill.
[31:54.33]I don't even know who the priority target here is.
[31:55.97]I don't know anything.
[31:56.99]Are you playing rank?
[32:12.81]Dude, I want to play with the controller.
[32:16.39]That actually sounds more fun.
[32:49.51]Somebody just said, nice aim.
[32:50.74]Dude, there's 10 people in the same fucking hallway.
[32:57.06]What do you mean nice aim?
[32:58.30]No one's aiming in there.
[32:59.40]Everyone's just fucking blowing snot rockets at each other and throwing fucking grenades into the air.
[33:25.48]How does my sensitivity feel so slow but so fast at the same time?
[33:29.00]We have mouse acceleration.
[33:44.95]Should I have it off or on?
[33:46.09]Actually, I don't know.
[33:46.89]What does mouse acceleration even do?
[33:48.47]For all these years, I've never even known.
[33:52.70]You want it off?
[33:53.90]I think it's probably already off.
[34:01.92]No, I don't want that on.
[34:03.06]Maybe a little bit higher.
[34:07.96]Already low.
[34:09.44]Alright, where's the healer?
[34:33.48]So much shit going on.
[34:37.04]What did I just bump into?
[34:38.04]Somebody please heal me.
[34:38.88]Somebody give me something.
[34:39.88]Throw me a fucking sandwich.
[34:53.73]Here's a tip for you.
[34:54.93]Pro tip for all the cowards out there.
[34:58.07]If you are running away and jumping, that means
[35:02.96]You can kill me because I am scared.
[35:05.00]I did a lot of fucking damage.
[35:16.77]Come on, get in here.
[35:23.25]Kill everybody.
[35:23.97]I don't care.
[35:24.25]I'll fight the whole team.
[35:25.09]I need heals.
[35:36.07]I thought that was a bad guy.
[35:37.35]I was like, oh shit, it's the Scarlet Witch.
[35:43.49]Where's the health pack?
[35:46.20]Oh, I just did absolutely fucking nothing and wasted so much time.
[35:48.86]These enemies just turn around.
[36:11.34]What am I bumping into?
[36:12.08]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[36:19.94]They're not really... I mean, they're just doing much better than we were doing, right?
[36:23.81]I don't think it's... I don't think anything can be done about it.
[36:36.36]What is happening?
[36:37.90]I'm gonna climb a fence!
[36:56.09]Kill him!
[36:56.91]Oh my god!
[37:13.49]Somebody get a kill!
[37:14.19]Somebody get a kill!
[37:19.73]Oh shit, what did I go back in for?
[37:34.00]Oh my god, I'm in so much trouble.
[37:39.74]I'm just breaking shit.
[37:52.95]What, 15,000 damage blocked is usually pretty good, right?
[37:55.67]15,000 to 20,000?
[38:24.17]We won.
[38:27.69]Oh, we lost.
[38:36.49]Somebody said, dude, that's viewers, not damage blocked.
[38:44.36]I think I did okay.
[38:46.42]I think I did alright.
[38:48.80]10k damage, 14k blocked.
[38:52.68]It's the most on the whole server.
[38:53.98]Let's take a look at what I do.
[39:01.14]I mean, this was pretty calculated.
[39:16.35]Give yourself a thumbs up.
[39:17.55]How about I thumbs up like everybody?
[39:21.90]And myself.
[39:32.62]dude thanks for the drops do I have drops on can you get drops right now Ster's gonna find out I played this and he'll be pissed that we didn't talk about it first he's gonna be like how did he not bring this up now he knows I've been playing it and watching it I was in his I've been watching his stream
[39:59.21]I know don't do don't play a different character.
[40:01.33]We want to see somebody else besides venom.
[40:05.50]One more round of venom and then we'll do something else.
[40:14.98]Actually, you know what?
[40:15.52]Yeah, I'll play Mr. Fantastic.
[40:17.34]Is he available?
[40:20.34]Do list.
[40:23.43]Alright, let's do it.
[40:24.01]Alright, we have a team up now.
[40:27.97]This is hot fresh out of the oven.
[40:31.16]So if you think I'm bad at this character, then just... We're all bad at this character, so you can't say that.
[40:36.82]Alright, so he's got... You bump people on your team.
[40:42.94]And it gives them and you a shield.
[40:46.86]You can also bump, I believe, enemies as well.
[40:52.42]The right click is you can grab two people and bonk them together, Three Stooges style.
[40:59.83]You want to build up the elasticity, which is the passive.
[41:02.41]Okay, this middle button here.
[41:04.23]I see the middle 30.
[41:05.83]When that gets to 100, I turn to the inflated guy.
[41:11.81]I think I can inflate two doing something else.
[41:13.45]I wonder if he has a travel.
[41:15.73]Oh, yeah.
[41:18.63]He has a DPS.
[41:19.41]Let's find out.
[41:31.45]OK, so you can.
[41:48.92]Oh OK, let's go.
[41:56.58]Oh shit, it's gone.
[42:04.45]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[42:05.39]It happens automatically.
[42:12.32]I also have a button for C. I think that's the team up move.
[42:19.18]Is there a travel move?
[42:20.44]Probably not.
[42:23.42]Hold on, what else we got here?
[42:25.30]I can't look at it yet.
[42:26.24]Alright, so I have the big thing.
[42:27.60]I've got the thing where you grab and bonk people together.
[42:30.21]I have the shield.
[42:32.69]And then whatever the other thing is.
[42:35.93]Oops.
[42:36.67]I was hoping somebody would shoot me.
[42:45.71]Oh, what is this shield?
[42:53.13]What's going on?
[43:01.09]Are they OK?
[43:01.61]I'm playing him like a tank.
[43:04.13]He's not a tank.
[43:04.97]He like kind of is though.
[43:07.31]When you turn into the you get like 700 health or something.
[43:21.58]Oh my God.
[43:32.69]I have the ult.
[44:01.87]Alright.
[44:02.99]Things are going.
[44:04.05]I think we lost.
[44:10.82]Unfortunately.
[44:11.44]You just got a kill for the first time ever.
[44:16.10]I need to read this.
[44:26.85]okay stretch body to absorb damage before yeah so you you can when I turn into the long big kind of chest guy you take a certain amount of damage and you can fires in the direction you're looking okay so this when I bump into people you get a shield and you give them a shield
[44:49.17]I need to be doing that way more often.
[44:51.91]Yeah, you can want people together.
[44:53.77]Elasticity.
[44:57.29]Alright, what about this?
[45:03.57]Making up for the lost health so that is the is just a damage boost.
[45:11.52]How long does the sea last?
[45:15.12]I don't.
[45:16.78]I guess it's just on.
[45:24.69]I think I want to give the shield to the healer.
[45:26.41]No one's going to take the bait?
[45:39.11]Oh my God, I'm so dead.
[46:03.50]OK, I gotta.
[46:05.39]This is why you take the character into practice for like 20 minutes before you play a video game with it.
[46:11.27]Because I kind of still don't understand what's going on.
[46:13.31]I do, but I don't.
[46:16.64]Don't get mad at me because that's a see through transparent phased door and some of them don't work in this game.
[46:39.02]Oh shit, that's an ult.
[47:01.77]What the fuck?
[47:05.67]We're still alive!
[47:12.30]Oh, he was doing the thing.
[47:13.50]Okay.
[47:16.82]Dude, that was your wife in there?
[47:18.54]On a different universe and a different team.
[47:27.68]That's the evil Universe Earth 5-2-5.
[48:02.88]We got it.
[48:17.98]Alright, back up, back up, back up.
[48:18.94]I'm not a tank.
[48:19.54]I gotta stop acting like one.
[48:30.02]I shot him right in the stomach.
[48:40.05]Is he doing any good?
[48:40.93]I think I'm good.
[48:43.23]Even in the face of cosmic cataclysm, every one of us can make a difference.
[48:50.60]Would you ever save me if I was drowning?
[48:54.36]I'm going to have to say the answer to that question is no.
[48:59.84]Because I have to take this question very literally.
[49:05.06]I can't.
[49:05.68]I'm currently in a different location.
[49:10.08]So we need to talk physically.
[49:12.70]Physically not possible.
[49:14.06]So no.
[49:30.64]Okay, now are we at the same, are we at the same pool?
[49:35.60]I'm going to look over at the lifeguard.
[49:36.78]If there's a lifeguard on duty, I'm going to say, lifeguard, lifeguard, and I'm going to be pointing.
[49:40.97]And then if after about two seconds, three seconds, the lifeguard hasn't dove in the water, I'm going in.
[49:48.25]Maybe like five seconds.
[49:49.49]Let the lifeguard do the job.
[49:54.45]If the lifeguard is not going to do the job, then now, okay, what do we do about this?
[49:59.27]I already have an ult.
[50:16.76]I'm not ready to give up yet.
[50:18.14]I love how springy he is.
[50:26.15]The ultimate is actually really fun, even though I feel like it does like three damage.
[50:31.05]That hurt a lot.
[50:37.75]I'm going around.
[51:02.99]I forget when that's down, they're going to all freak out and shoot at the same time.
[51:11.78]Such an idiot.
[51:14.58]I mean, I have so much damage blocked.
[51:17.34]I keep acting like a tank and it's ruining everything.
[51:29.93]If I didn't change, I would have killed him.
[51:35.83]If I didn't transform, he would have died.
[51:44.14]I won't rest until this is solved.
[51:52.23]I might go.
[51:52.87]I don't know something that just like a ton of damage.
[52:04.72]come on man ah alright I gotta what am I gonna do here I gotta I know what idea do I really have to ask that question I'm gonna get this point right now we're already getting it we're already gonna win look they're gonna get it right now I got I have overtime I have at least two seconds overtime I'm gonna win the game right now
[52:44.04]Thank you for killing that person.
[52:55.61]OK, now let's win it.
[53:03.99]I don't care.
[53:04.49]I don't care.
[53:04.97]I was going in.
[53:05.43]I don't fucking care.
[53:06.89]Ask me if I care.
[53:30.33]I just saved you.
[53:32.84]I don't care.
[53:36.05]Do it, kill me, do it.
[53:38.09]Do it, kill me.
[54:03.00]I don't know, there's too much stuff on this thing.
[54:09.27]She had a god mode?
[54:10.21]She's been in hell!
[54:13.31]Who am I yelling that to?
[54:20.48]Did we lose?
[54:22.42]Wait, what?
[54:22.98]I was too busy laughing at nothing.
[54:26.56]Oh my god.
[54:27.50]I was too busy laughing at the fact that it felt like she had been in hell.
[54:37.67]It's okay.
[54:49.76]I'm doing okay.
[54:52.20]Player 480 is certainly doing a good job, I think.
[54:59.74]Hey, buddy, I'm pissed.
[55:00.92]Why?
[55:01.18]Relax.
[55:05.76]Alright, chat's choice.
[55:06.66]I will play the first character I see as long as it's not one of the 20 characters I don't know how to play.
[55:16.14]I'm not playing, Jeff.
[55:18.96]Just play Hulk.
[55:19.60]Okay, I saw Hulk.
[55:20.45]I'll play Hulk.
[55:30.71]Mm-hmm.
[55:36.17]Cool.
[55:38.11]I think you, yeah, you get stuff for this.
[55:40.09]You get like currency.
[55:47.11]Here's the new season.
[55:47.79]Is that Loki?
[56:03.49]Yeah, I think it is.
[56:06.80]You like the new season?
[56:07.60]I just trying to for the first time.
[56:10.38]I don't know, maybe.
[56:14.33]I think the game is fun.
[56:26.82]This one thing that I will say about this game that is a little confusing.
[56:32.22]So when you start to go through, when you start to have characters change their entire appearance, this is where it starts to be like, I could confuse this for Dr. Strange.
[56:45.37]In fact, I actually didn't even know who this was until this is Magneto.
[56:51.27]It feels like some of the characters, especially when they're full, complete model work or redesign for the skin, can kind of be kind of confusing as to who the character actually even is.
[57:03.42]I think you just old.
[57:05.12]Well, maybe.
[57:05.56]I think overtime you just will know.
[57:11.20]They're all based on.
[57:14.95]Yeah, actually that is really cool.
[57:16.11]If you look see it says.
[57:18.27]First it tells you where they first appeared in the comic books.
[57:21.85]Well, this one is not that.
[57:25.07]Or 2018 OK.
[57:30.42]These are all originals.
[57:32.18]This one is not.
[57:33.74]This is from House of M from 2005.
[57:36.92]Interesting.
[57:43.72]Cool.
[57:47.93]They also do this too, where you can... This is because of the new characters, but... Yeah, this is cool.
[57:55.53]They have these little comic books where if you do...
[57:59.81]Certain missions or achievements or something.
[58:01.39]I think you can unlock the pages.
[58:05.88]Because now there's this one.
[58:11.44]That's cute.
[58:11.82]That's cool.
[58:17.77]The art is great.
[58:21.87]It is.
[58:22.29]Alright, I'm going to play.
[58:23.03]I'll play Hulk.
[58:28.79]Is this an ad?
[58:29.71]If it was an ad, it would be in the... It'd be in the... No!
[58:37.80]You know what?
[58:39.90]Time that person out for an hour.
[58:54.18]You can time them out in dog years.
[58:56.90]So it's two minutes.
[58:58.27]We have 10 minutes, whatever it is.
[59:01.53]I'll play Hulk.
[59:14.87]Yeah, give him a... What would a year ban be in dog years?
[59:28.29]Oh, now you're a nine-year-old boy.
[59:30.17]Oh, that's right.
[59:31.09]Yeah.
[59:35.37]Something about it is just... I don't know.
[59:37.13]It kind of reminds me of a toddler somehow.
[59:40.97]I don't know why.
[59:41.57]I guess it's just he rages.
[59:44.32]He's kind of stumpy.
[59:46.06]He doesn't really talk that much.
[59:48.38]He's kind of like a baby.
[59:51.74]And he's really popular with a lot of young kids.
[59:55.98]He's popular.
[59:58.08]I don't know.
[60:09.42]He's just like you.
[60:13.52]The only difference is I'm not this big.
[60:20.97]Sorry, guys.
[60:23.15]The same exact... Okay, hold on.
[60:25.95]What the fuck am I doing?
[60:40.39]I can't even through that.
[60:41.81]I can definitely through there as a man.
[60:43.41]OK, I'm fine.
[60:49.68]Yeah, when you die as the Hulk, you don't die.
[60:51.28]You just turn into a regular guy.
[60:52.90]You just like get your console unplugged.
[60:55.52]You get the VR helmet taken off.
[60:56.85]You have to fight as a regular guy.
[61:03.13]Oh shit, that's Spider-Man.
[61:14.10]Oh, you're about to turn into a regular guy.
[61:16.28]What's wrong with you?
[61:18.17]Did you hear that?
[61:19.05]It was like guy.
[61:21.49]I didn't bring some like tea.
[61:51.83]I'm just trying to be weird so they stop fighting me for a second.
[61:57.24]Oh, not going to make it.
[62:09.04]Oh, shit.
[62:09.52]There was a Hulk next to me.
[62:14.50]Oh, my God.
[62:14.88]I'm back.
[62:17.41]Yeah, you can be Omega Hulk too eventually.
[62:30.58]Shit.
[62:37.54]Fall team wipe!
[62:39.00]Fall team wipe!
[63:16.95]Oh, this is so popular with the youth without a doubt.
[63:26.88]Do you still have much fun?
[63:27.86]Do you have any idea how fun that would be as a nine-year-old boy?
[63:31.58]Do you have any idea how fun that would just would have been?
[63:35.23]You don't need those two gloves.
[63:51.86]OK, I can take care of you.
[63:52.82]What's up?
[64:41.60]Yep, almost had it.
[64:43.89]Nice try though.
[65:11.66]I'm like squeaking.
[65:12.76]Do you guys hear me?
[65:14.16]I'm going like... Air is coming out of my body by playing this game.
[65:21.11]Just moving my hands around.
[65:25.58]They nerfed that, didn't they?
[65:37.63]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[66:11.37]Ow.
[66:11.43]Alright, I need to shield, shield, shield!
[66:15.14]Get by me, get by me!
[66:46.87]Oh my god, get out.
[66:47.91]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[66:48.99]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[66:49.91]This is the perfect place to do this.
[67:19.01]Alright, this is spawn camping.
[67:20.13]We need to get out of there.
[67:23.00]This isn't very nice, is it?
[67:41.09]Who dare get on the point?
[67:42.61]OK, Hulk is spawn.
[67:51.38]Press Q to do a special grab.
[67:58.40]Oh, I've seen that, yeah.
[68:04.41]Could have been better.
[68:05.25]Three player KO streak.
[68:11.13]Are you going to play Nikki?
[68:17.41]Yes, I am.
[68:19.46]Possibly.
[68:22.84]I'm going to play Infinity Nikki.
[68:24.52]Don't worry, everybody that's worrying.
[68:40.99]Try Squirrel Girl.
[68:51.17]Yeah, I've played.
[68:51.91]I've played this character before.
[68:54.29]I've seen this character played.
[68:57.57]I've played it before.
[68:58.53]The tail jump.
[69:04.68]Yeah, you throw like a big wheel, right?
[69:06.44]And you can.
[69:09.84]Can't you?
[69:11.74]You can do two tail jumps or two wheels, I believe.
[69:19.56]They can go like point
[69:23.52]And then the right click is... I think this is an immobilize and it bounces around.
[69:28.36]And then the ultimate is a bunch of squirrels that attack everybody.
[69:30.55]Sounds goofy.
[69:47.00]Yeah, these are bombs too.
[69:48.68]They detonate or they explode on contact.
[69:52.12]She's pretty good.
[69:53.42]Kind of like a Junkrat.
[69:56.25]Kind of, yeah.
[69:56.71]That's what it feels like.
[69:58.59]Are they already hitting it?
[70:06.48]What?
[70:07.18]How?
[70:22.99]Holy shit, I died.
[70:26.65]Oh, that's an Iron Man.
[70:30.07]Oh, he's okay.
[70:31.59]I gotta... I gotta deal with that.
[70:49.87]Whoa!
[70:55.32]Trying to kill the lady.
[71:04.90]Man, there's an Iron Man.
[71:13.48]Shit.
[71:19.80]Oh my gosh, he's almost dead.
[71:20.86]I just can't finish the job.
[71:33.32]to normal here.
[71:34.35]Oh, I thought I was going to get him on the down run there.
[71:59.92]Yes, Bro Girl is fun.
[72:01.88]Behind us!
[72:03.54]I don't even know if I should have done that.
[72:20.24]Ah!
[72:24.24]Oh, he's dialed up right now.
[72:26.36]I see.
[72:35.99]Dude, player 480.
[72:37.11]Can you believe it?
[72:45.68]That's my favorite part about Squirrel Girl.
[72:47.12]I love the jump.
[72:47.66]Do not... I am dead if I... Oh my goodness!
[73:06.51]I thought I was just gonna be able to turn around and just go my merry way.
[73:09.06]Apparently not.
[73:11.56]Are you gonna be in Squid Game?
[73:13.08]No, I'm not.
[73:14.10]No, I'm not gonna be in anything.
[73:17.01]I'm gonna be in Marvel Rivals Season 1.
[73:19.93]Playing it as a streamer right now.
[73:36.09]I'm just taking a lot of the air too.
[73:37.25]Where's that Iron Man?
[73:55.43]How did he jump over that?
[73:56.83]It's fine.
[74:01.57]God, Iron Man, you are so annoying!
[74:11.33]All I'm trying to do is annoy that Iron Man.
[74:13.40]That's the only thing I want to do.
[74:24.80]We didn't get to see.
[74:26.24]Oh, let's come back.
[74:27.06]Alright.
[74:37.06]So the squirrels just kind of have a mind of their own.
[74:38.40]They just kind of attack random stuff.
[75:00.98]Yeah, get rid of the Iron Man.
[75:02.22]If you hit the Iron Man once, he'll run away.
[75:11.74]Shit.
[75:23.43]You want your projectiles to hit enemy players.
[75:26.11]Pro tip.
[75:26.63]Well, I... Oh, okay.
[75:28.31]I thought you're supposed to kind of like go off the backboard to make sure you guarantee the basket to go in.
[75:37.66]Don't let this person get away.
[75:46.98]Double stun.
[75:47.60]That's gonna be annoying.
[75:53.70]There's a person in this room.
[75:58.18]You can get so tunnel visioned in this game.
[76:01.23]We are all not even looking behind us.
[76:03.51]She just killed everybody.
[76:06.39]She just destroyed us.
[76:07.71]We weren't even looking behind us.
[76:17.46]Is this the number one squirrel girl streamer on Twitch?
[76:22.24]We held it for a minute or so though, but I dropped a few ranks.
[76:27.51]Last I checked, yeah, I was number one.
[76:29.73]I haven't played in a couple of days.
[76:31.93]I dropped down to 64,994.
[76:32.43]That's global too.
[76:32.87]That's global.
[76:33.55]That's pretty good.
[76:57.83]Ooh.
[77:04.98]Sick.
[77:06.04]Very nice.
[77:13.67]You are the same exact person I'm looking for.
[77:27.68]I'm just, all I'm doing is just being annoying.
[77:43.27]Oh, bye.
[77:52.85]Get on that cart.
[77:59.25]Oh come on please.
[78:06.41]No.
[78:14.22]We didn't do it.
[78:14.74]How's Mr. Fantastic?
[78:23.60]Seems very good.
[78:26.48]Seems like fun to play.
[78:36.66]Oh shit.
[78:37.30]Okay.
[78:38.00]Oh my god.
[78:40.04]Oh my god.
[78:40.66]This is a high scoring game.
[78:45.85]Usually one team has a couple people that have 20 to 25 kills, 30 kills.
[78:52.65]Seems like both teams had that this time.
[78:55.29]Evenly matched.
[79:03.16]I want to do Squirrel Girl again.
[79:04.16]That was fun.
[79:14.36]You actually survived crazy long.
[79:15.76]Pick your hero or villain.
[79:20.23]I'm not judging.
[79:23.69]I just I love shooting a short use projectile into a hallway.
[79:27.83]It's one of the most fun things you can do in a video game.
[79:31.10]One of the most fun things you can do.
[79:34.00]Is that classic just Demoman pipe bombs into bouncing it off a corner of a wall into a hallway and you just hear the.
[79:46.90]You're like, I feel great.
[79:48.90]That's like just absolute dopamine.
[79:58.71]Even if you just lose, let's say you just get killed right after that.
[80:03.31]Something about bouncing it and having it ricochet off a wall and go into a room with a bunch of sentries in it and stuff and you just hear the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[80:12.21]I can go to bed now.
[80:13.71]I can relax now.
[80:24.29]Who says we are undefeatable?
[80:43.13]Who says that you hear that a lot?
[80:48.65]OK, that was another door that I thought I could go through.
[80:58.49]Kind of kill that thing that Penny Parker puts that down.
[81:14.92]He must be hurt.
[81:16.22]Run away that scared.
[81:30.05]Damn it.
[81:30.39]I was looking for him too.
[81:31.21]Shit.
[81:32.05]I knew he was going to show up.
[81:39.55]What's the inspiration for player 480?
[81:44.71]Because that's... Why did I just... I was looking to chat and I could have just jumped on that thing.
[81:59.37]I'm distracting.
[82:10.55]I'm afraid he's going to drop a bomb on the point right now.
[82:14.86]That's what I would do.
[82:15.34]Oops, I didn't want to do that.
[82:21.66]I didn't want to do that either.
[82:22.46]I pressed the wrong button three times.
[82:26.78]I just pressed... Every wrong button was pressed.
[82:41.65]Ah, but he stood still too.
[82:50.42]Get the fuck out of here.
[83:08.50]There we go.
[83:08.97]Oh, right there.
[83:09.49]That's it.
[83:39.39]3D stream relies to viewers to get them to watch popular esports game?
[83:44.55]What are you?
[83:45.15]What crack are you on?
[83:52.04]I gotta get way more damage than this.
[83:53.76]This is a 1400 damage.
[83:55.26]I may as well not have done anything.
[83:56.36]30 seconds before you attack.
[83:58.76]Get ready.
[84:11.31]Yeah, I was thinking about turning the stream on and having the stream deliberately be streamed in like 25 FPS and put a different microphone on and just say that I pre-recorded like 25 hours of Marvel Rivals footage and I was just going to stream it 24-7 until it was over.
[84:33.53]I knew it was just going to be me sitting here.
[84:37.21]With a bunch of scuffed equipment.
[84:44.64]Let's go look in.
[84:55.30]Ah, come on.
[84:56.20]I see him.
[84:57.26]I see him.
[85:00.83]This is a weird guy.
[85:01.77]Is this the new map?
[85:02.87]Is this map available?
[85:03.91]Or is this the new one?
[85:11.90]He's just bouncing around.
[85:22.15]Oh, hello.
[85:31.22]Turn the quality of the game down.
[85:32.66]The thing about turning the quality down is in 2025, even if you put the quality to zero, it still kind of looks good.
[85:42.69]Resolution being down would look bad.
[86:11.65]in America.
[86:15.24]Another beautiful stinger from player 480 is what I was going to say.
[86:28.71]A little stinger from, you know, player 480.
[86:40.88]You know, just a little fucking stinger.
[86:42.88]Oops, I thought that was an enemy Star-Lord.
[87:07.01]Three Eye of Agamotto.
[87:13.66]Wait, but in this game, can they go... Three Eye of... They can, okay.
[87:26.97]Good.
[87:34.15]They sure can.
[87:39.86]I love this comment.
[87:42.56]He said, yay, you won with a happy face.
[87:48.11]Hey, look at that, I won.
[87:49.21]I didn't really do that much damage.
[87:58.66]I guess neither did anybody else.
[88:02.58]the Penny Parker destroyed in that round.
[88:06.12]Alright, let's take a look.
[88:07.70]We gotta look at the MVP highlight.
[88:26.17]Look at me over there bouncing around.
[88:27.48]Look at me just getting all these stingers.
[88:44.45]Why did that feel like it went on like a little long?
[88:52.70]I feel like that highlight was like two or three minutes.
[89:03.02]Send your first message in chat.
[89:10.54]Ooh, that was a good one.
[89:15.53]Did these do anything?
[89:18.50]Try the new game mode.
[89:23.18]No.
[89:23.50]Okay.
[89:24.18]Just a lore item.
[89:24.94]Okay.
[89:35.41]That Penny Parker looks really strong.
[89:47.70]Alright, who else?
[89:50.78]Do I dare try Mr. Fantastic again?
[89:53.60]I'm going for it.
[89:59.87]Wolverine.
[90:00.45]Wolverine's a good pick too.
[90:04.63]Okay, I'll embarrass myself on this for another 5-10 minutes and then we'll probably go to Wolverine?
[90:22.65]Alex just rolled in.
[90:23.93]Why is this pro gamer on his Smurf account to get more MOABs recorded?
[90:27.33]What's up dude?
[90:39.42]Yeah, see me on my main account.
[90:41.54]It's on fucking Xbox Series S.
[91:04.11]Oh, by the way, being the guy that talked a bunch of phrases for the Series S feels really weird when everybody talks about how much they fucking hate that console for existing.
[91:14.72]Every time I'm like, man, the series is, I love this little thing.
[91:17.34]Oh, it's so cool.
[91:18.22]It plays like all these games and all you hear is how it just ruins every experience because everyone has to make their games work for the series.
[91:25.69]By the way, these three scooches, those two, that's worth at least a hundred dollars in game currency.
[91:29.59]Alright, I'm going to shut the fuck, I'm not going to say that anymore.
[91:37.32]Uh,
[91:40.78]I love that little thing and to hear that so many developers and so many people like well you see everybody that's complaining about the game right now that's because the series s exists and it was a nightmare I'm just sitting there with my Netflix open and and like the fourth game this month that I've played on my you know look you get it or you get it with gold or whatever
[92:09.72]Everybody hates this thing.
[92:17.27]I don't know if this is a Mr. Fantastic kind of a game right now.
[92:42.99]Diablo 4 console.
[92:44.21]No, you see that's where you're wrong.
[92:45.66]I hate that game, so that's where you are wrong on that.
[92:58.57]You were correct.
[93:00.21]I did play it on console.
[93:11.04]I'm okay.
[93:11.83]Something's got to change here.
[93:13.11]I'm being like a talking Andy.
[93:16.20]We're going to... I know what I need to do.
[93:46.58]God, they're everywhere.
[93:48.10]They have so much damage.
[94:01.57]Auto swing, auto swing.
[94:03.14]I am learning the character.
[94:18.51]Wait, I want to do this.
[94:26.29]I can't do it.
[94:33.41]Can't do it there either.
[94:39.36]Turn off easy swing, but you're going to mess up my whole game.
[94:47.42]easy sing easy easy swing okay what does that do
[95:19.61]I don't understand how... what it's attaching to.
[95:22.41]I... I guess I'll... Alright, what's that?
[95:38.93]What is that?
[95:40.53]You know, I need that playing to be able to play as Venom.
[95:42.67]You understand?
[95:47.04]That's the biggest problem that I have so far right now.
[95:57.62]Are you just mashing keys?
[95:58.66]I am not mashing keys.
[96:05.12]He got away from it!
[96:10.00]I'm good.
[96:10.46]It's spider time!
[96:44.02]Whoa.
[96:54.05]I was going to say, how does that look?
[96:56.47]Okay, what is your death cam going to look like, right?
[96:58.85]Like your death cam is going to be crazy.
[97:00.55]You're going to be like, there's no fucking way.
[97:02.89]Also, the whole time you're going to be like, how did everybody let him do that?
[97:08.90]Why was nobody killing that guy?
[97:24.07]That real target is the thing I was aiming at.
[97:32.45]Are you enjoying it?
[97:35.55]Yeah, I do.
[97:35.99]I think it's fun.
[97:40.85]I wouldn't be playing it right now if I didn't think so.
[97:45.41]Save your swing for escape rather than for offense.
[97:49.71]It usually is fine by the time I get in there.
[97:55.08]But through.
[97:59.32]I know I just didn't fucking listen.
[98:05.22]Sorry, I just seem to have a listening problem.
[98:20.65]10,000 damage block.
[98:21.29]Get that to 20k and we'll talk.
[98:26.33]Same guy who voiced John Arbuckle voiced this guy.
[98:29.63]Really?
[98:29.91]Didn't expect that.
[98:52.12]Yeah!
[98:56.11]How come there's no emote that I can't press to have him just lean his head back and fucking just scream.
[99:02.65]Let's go baby!
[99:03.83]Come on!
[99:04.65]That would be a great emote to have.
[99:09.19]Especially like dying in the middle of that too.
[99:11.13]Targeted precision missile!
[99:33.83]Where'd you go?
[100:16.56]Jerm's playing a modern multiplayer game.
[100:18.90]Who kidnapped him?
[100:19.82]Hey, what modern multiplayer games come out in the last three or four years?
[100:40.73]Conquered.
[100:45.85]Did Concord even come out?
[100:50.71]Or did they get so much bad press that the game just didn't come out?
[100:58.42]No, it did come out.
[100:59.38]It did come out.
[101:07.21]No, it came out and then they took it out within a few months, right?
[101:11.01]It was like a week?
[101:12.93]No, it was like a month or two.
[101:17.96]no man I don't know man I before that happens I think it's just like you know what everyone's gonna be in a clown costume hey by the way we're like changing everything um yeah we know like no one's buying it like everyone's unhappy with it um every character is going to be a clown until the servers turn off in a month and everyone's gonna get clown moves and we don't even care anymore they would have sold a million copies
[101:42.23]Yeah, just, oh hey guys, yeah, for the last week of the server, it's online.
[101:45.79]Every single character gets a, it takes two minutes to build up, but it's a, it's a nuke that you get to drop on the map.
[101:53.95]I think they would have gotten some sales.
[101:55.11]I am annoying.
[102:13.74]I would love a clown game, honestly.
[102:24.13]Or just make the characters have... Oh yeah, this character, their old move was... Shoots three darts out in a sprawling pattern that detonate after five seconds.
[102:38.72]It's like the nerf symbol.
[102:40.12]Like, oh, that's been changed.
[102:41.40]Yeah, we've done the patch notes for changing that.
[102:44.11]Character can now run 5,000% faster for three seconds.
[102:48.11]It's one of the moves.
[102:49.25]Like, just go fucking crazy.
[103:00.98]Penny's got so much shit on this point.
[103:03.00]We can't even get over here.
[103:04.58]They've got this on complete lockdown.
[103:10.44]Squirt guns, pies, flowers, zappers.
[103:12.72]Oh yeah, the whole thing.
[103:15.20]And then if enough people buy your clown FPS, then you just change the title of the game to like Battle of the Clowns and who cares?
[103:30.81]I'm going around the whole way.
[103:36.84]No, no, no, no.
[103:37.36]I think you did.
[103:38.18]Don't call it Clown Court.
[103:39.40]No.
[103:43.48]No, it's called Night of a Thousand Clowns.
[103:49.23]I don't know.
[103:50.41]You have to change it.
[103:51.05]It's completely different.
[103:52.17]It can't be connected at all.
[103:57.21]I didn't really play very much at the end there.
[103:58.69]We were talking about other things.
[104:03.27]Make it 500 V 500.
[104:10.07]That's a funny concept too.
[104:11.11]Hey, yeah, we're turning the servers off, but let's just see how many people can be in one game.
[104:15.48]Well, for the last two weeks, there's no limit to the amount of people that can connect to one map.
[104:24.31]Yeah, it's just that everyone's connecting to the same game.
[104:26.59]Doesn't matter what country.
[104:27.81]Doesn't matter what ping.
[104:29.80]Everybody is connecting and picking a character and then joining this one payload map.
[104:36.90]They wouldn't even fill a 500v500 lobby.
[104:42.08]Oh, that was mean.
[104:46.95]That was mean.
[104:50.27]Alright, we gotta take a look at the highlights.
[105:07.79]Are these some of the only two kills the team had?
[105:12.08]How many kills do we have total?
[105:17.84]A lot, actually.
[105:19.84]Why did I think we had two?
[105:21.52]We had like 40.
[105:31.05]Those are your only two kills.
[105:33.23]That's right.
[105:34.37]It's okay.
[105:34.95]Alright.
[105:37.23]I want to play this round as Wolverine.
[105:50.48]Alright.
[105:56.92]Let's go.
[106:00.75]I know there's a hunter jump with Wolverine.
[106:02.95]That's not it.
[106:03.37]It's that.
[106:04.76]Okay, so there's a jump and there was like a slash.
[106:08.12]You know, who cares?
[106:09.44]I don't even know what's going on.
[106:10.76]I don't even know what's going on.
[106:12.49]I don't know anything.
[106:13.29]I don't even get it.
[106:13.85]I don't know what I'm doing.
[106:29.92]The hell?
[106:32.44]Oh, he can throw me.
[106:33.39]Is that me?
[106:37.79]Wait, no, there's another Wolverine.
[107:11.79]Everybody left.
[107:15.27]Oh sweet.
[107:20.37]Alright, probably probably from me.
[107:21.94]I want you from me.
[107:29.30]I mean it worked.
[107:30.76]It worked.
[107:31.10]I was gonna say a little further, but that worked just fine.
[107:51.34]Uh, let's do it again.
[107:59.13]This feels very weird.
[108:09.63]Perfectly perched, too.
[108:13.25]I am an... Okay, I'm part of a cosmetic.
[108:16.55]I just may as well be an accessory at this point.
[108:18.54]He has a skin on him.
[108:24.79]He just killed the whole team.
[108:27.25]What just happened?
[108:39.41]What the fuck just happened?
[108:48.99]He threw me, I did another dive, and then I did my ult.
[108:52.31]I guess that everyone was just kind of concentrated in the same spot.
[109:01.26]Wolverine is kind of disgusting, okay?
[109:07.28]Is this the perfect character for me?
[109:10.21]When you just blindly just go into a blind rage and just start swinging at stuff?
[109:14.53]I think this is perfect.
[109:17.31]Ah, shit.
[109:20.26]Oh, God.
[109:55.90]Hey, that was a lot of fun.
[109:58.55]No idea what just happened.
[110:02.29]I think I pressed.
[110:02.99]OK, I need to relax.
[110:06.39]I am just mashing buttons and pressing space and turning my mouse in random directions.
[110:12.98]It works, it works, but it doesn't really.
[110:16.50]Not really.
[110:38.26]Where's health on this map?
[110:45.81]Where's health?
[110:53.89]I missed.
[111:02.52]OK, that was fun.
[111:03.42]That was very confusing, but I had a good time doing it.
[111:06.80]Why are you moaning?
[111:07.64]Because it's intense.
[111:16.43]The leap is a grab OK.
[111:21.99]It's gotta be.
[111:22.47]I want to see what happened here.
[111:23.29]It's gotta be the thing that happened in the beginning, right?
[111:25.55]Yeah.
[111:27.19]This was crazy.
[111:35.69]God.
[111:38.86]That ult is disgusting.
[111:45.44]Wolverine sounds good again.
[112:00.85]Pick your hero.
[112:02.33]Or villain, I'm not judging.
[112:04.75]Anyone stands in my way, they won't be standing much longer.
[112:08.86]Truly, I already kind of know how he works, but truly though.
[112:14.38]But that's just a dash forward and you go slash.
[112:18.64]This is a damage mitigation, OK?
[112:26.20]OK, so after you dive.
[112:29.40]But what's the passive?
[112:31.82]Yeah.
[112:40.57]Rage builds when Wolverine attacks or takes hits.
[112:46.19]So you just want to be, you want to just get up in there and just start slashing.
[112:49.97]Okay, so this is a damage mitigation.
[112:53.59]This is the jump.
[112:54.51]You want to grab somebody.
[112:56.13]This is a dash and then just slash.
[112:59.26]And then the ult is a launch everybody up and then launch everybody down.
[113:09.35]How is Wolverine free difficulty?
[113:13.89]Um.
[113:16.55]Maybe because when you get.
[113:18.19]Do a little bit higher rankings.
[113:21.14]Maybe people just know how to deal with the Wolverine unless you play very well now.
[113:24.84]Alright, let's go.
[113:44.29]I got a little overzealous there.
[113:47.05]I just saw red.
[113:57.06]Use the dash first.
[114:01.22]I'm playing it like a Left 4 Dead Hunter.
[114:12.38]OK, OK, it goes high.
[114:13.62]It goes really high.
[114:15.60]I thought it was going to just aim pretty low like a line drive.
[114:18.41]Alright, you gotta aim that.
[114:32.39]It's got it's insanely low.
[114:35.22]If you want to try to grab somebody that's on the ground, you need to aim the cursor at the ground.
[114:42.07]Be right on top of them to hit the grab.
[114:53.49]It always goes up.
[114:54.73]Okay.
[115:10.03]Ah, I thought it was you.
[115:19.36]What the?
[115:25.96]Curious thing you've probably seen.
[115:50.99]You solo ulted Hela.
[115:57.86]It doesn't matter.
[115:58.52]You gotta, hey, secure the kill.
[116:01.22]Oh.
[116:30.51]Okay, I was really hoping that I was going to die and be able to kill somebody with low health so they would get to see the replay.
[116:37.22]Like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[116:38.96]This guy is a moron.
[116:40.06]This guy is like attacking the walls.
[116:42.78]He doesn't even know where he is.
[117:04.93]Don't let them cap it.
[117:06.91]Oh.
[117:08.15]Look at that.
[117:11.63]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[117:19.68]Do we have a healer?
[117:27.52]We do.
[117:27.90]I think they were just dead.
[117:37.03]Dermot, your copy of Deadlock looks weird.
[117:39.05]I'm not going to play.
[117:39.71]Deadlock is... Too bad.
[117:48.64]No, Deadlock is a game I'm not going to play.
[117:54.68]We played the Marvel game.
[118:03.52]I can't wait.
[118:05.98]I can't wait.
[118:19.27]I'm going to have so much fun.
[118:20.83]I can't wait to go fight everybody.
[118:21.97]This is going to be the most fun thing ever.
[118:42.86]let's go I'm gonna drop my pitch by like 20% put a reverb on it and be like hello everybody it's me Venom I'm here to say that good luck in the game and good luck in everything in real life and stuff
[119:06.71]And then, dude, I'm going to fucking upload that shit to YouTube Shorts.
[119:12.65]And I'm going to... The title of the channel and the video is going to be The Venom Guy.
[119:25.53]Wow.
[119:31.37]Holy shit.
[119:43.02]Stop doing bits you're losing.
[119:44.84]I know, I start to lose when I start to use the other hemisphere of my brain.
[119:56.11]See, I'm all good using one hemisphere at a time.
[119:59.11]The second that you have to start using multiple hemispheres... Oh god, no.
[120:02.41]It's over.
[120:15.90]I want you to die!
[120:16.88]No!
[120:17.00]No!
[120:40.37]It's I'm not moaning.
[120:41.81]I am expelling air out of my mouth as a frustration.
[120:46.73]But what just happened to my character?
[120:55.94]Can tell it goes.
[121:13.24]Oh boy, oh boy.
[121:14.04]Getting kind of destroyed now.
[121:18.78]Oh, I think we need, we need damage.
[121:21.98]We need some real damage.
[121:23.08]I think a lot of golems are just hurt and scared.
[121:27.85]It would be really nice to help them after I ping an acorn off their foreheads.
[121:58.10]What the hell just walked in here?
[121:59.46]OK, is it weird that I feel like playing Rocket Raccoon is the same thing as playing Oddjob in the N64 Goldeneye?
[122:17.99]People can just shoot over you.
[122:34.94]Good game.
[122:40.00]Damn, we're old.
[122:45.16]Are you going to sign up for the Elden Ring Night Rain network test?
[122:50.38]No, just play it when it comes out.
[122:52.95]Let's play it when it's ready.
[123:02.57]Alright.
[123:04.46]I'm going to play.
[123:05.04]Are you going to play competitive?
[123:05.98]No, not today.
[123:09.50]If ever.
[123:14.92]It just looked like everyone was having fun with it and I wanted to try it and I want to play it and I want to stream it.
[123:18.42]So I'm streaming.
[123:24.92]And Infinity Nikki will be.
[123:26.20]In after three or four more matches.
[123:35.73]Is that also why you don't want to play Deadlock?
[123:42.33]Less so, but I will say that anytime I've ever played a game that was in a very early state, I always find something I really don't like about it and then just write the game off for the rest of my life.
[123:55.10]And sometimes it takes up to a year before that thing that I didn't like is either gone, changed, or not the same.
[124:11.06]So if you play an alpha and there's something you really don't like about it, you're like, holy shit, this sucks.
[124:14.86]This is so ass right now, but I like the game, but I'm going to keep playing it.
[124:17.91]I fucking hate this thing.
[124:20.17]You kind of build up this kind of annoyance over the thing you're playing already.
[124:30.31]This is the new map.
[124:42.36]Yeah, and again, the thing we're talking about could be something that's not changed or fixed for a very long time.
[124:48.71]So I'd rather just play the game.
[124:50.27]Hey, it's done.
[124:52.13]If you hate it now, you're going to hate it.
[125:21.07]I don't know where the health packs are.
[125:24.29]Oh dear, somebody's chasing me.
[125:27.43]What?
[125:27.87]Who?
[125:31.54]Oh, she saw the whole thing.
[125:33.72]She saw the entire thing.
[125:36.28]Wait, what?
[125:43.57]What hit me?
[125:45.75]What just happened?
[125:50.68]Was it through the door?
[125:51.91]Oh, that shit in the way.
[126:08.29]It just fucked me up so bad.
[126:26.27]Do you think venom is sustainable?
[126:28.51]Oh, the TTK right?
[126:30.24]The time to kill.
[126:31.14]I love that one person that was over in stirs channel a week ago when I said that.
[126:46.19]How do you remember that?
[126:53.61]We need to get something going here.
[126:55.90]They're kind of dominating this.
[127:12.67]We're going.
[127:28.34]I didn't even hit anybody.
[127:39.37]Why do I feel so alone?
[127:56.03]OK, I'm just going Punisher.
[128:16.64]What the fuck?
[128:24.94]That was the scared guy.
[128:26.28]You see the scared guy?
[128:27.24]Don't jump when somebody's doing that.
[128:30.54]Oh, there's a shotgun.
[128:31.42]Right, right, right.
[128:31.92]Okay, okay, okay.
[128:42.57]I'm just curious.
[128:55.30]We can't do anything.
[129:02.69]Okay, I need to just... Where are... We keep individually walking up and dying.
[129:08.99]I think individually.
[129:21.26]I don't... I don't even...
[129:26.79]Teleport shit.
[129:28.57]What do you mean NA aim?
[129:29.87]She's flying around in fucking portals.
[129:35.21]She is going from here to here in one second.
[129:37.58]I don't know, maybe we could, we can't, we can't even leave the spawn.
[129:52.04]Look at this.
[130:28.97]No, no, I didn't.
[130:29.71]I wanted to check everybody else's.
[130:32.23]Oh, damn it.
[130:32.99]I was, I didn't mean to click that.
[130:34.51]I wanted to see if everybody had that.
[130:43.27]Alright, two more, two more, two more, three more.
[130:57.65]But how does it calculate that?
[130:59.37]Because.
[130:59.79]I did at least one point.
[131:03.14]It definitely needs to calculate the amount of points you get in a certain amount of time frame or 10 seconds or something.
[131:18.89]Will you play this with a group of friends?
[131:23.16]Um.
[131:23.36]I don't know, maybe.
[131:26.62]I'm kind of just chilling.
[131:30.52]I did this to make sure there was an intro for Infinity Nikki.
[131:41.58]I was stirring hope.
[131:44.87]Those are gamers.
[131:46.91]I know Etalyx plays it too.
[131:49.24]Everybody's playing it right now.
[132:07.87]Stopping by while I'm at work on lunch.
[132:10.59]I did start kind of early.
[132:11.49]That's right.
[132:12.05]It's lunchtime, isn't it?
[132:16.68]I hope you have a good lunch.
[132:17.70]I hope you have a good kale and beet salad with your grilled chicken wrap.
[132:25.95]Light on the lettuce and light on the mayo.
[132:29.29]I know that's how you like it.
[133:01.26]We are undefeatable.
[133:06.70]I'm just trying to scare them.
[133:37.92]I'm doing pretty good.
[133:43.17]Nice heals.
[133:48.02]That's how we do it?
[134:18.28]We're doing the same thing that just happened to us.
[134:31.92]Does anybody have to be touching this for it to move?
[134:33.47]I imagine, yeah.
[134:34.09]Really?
[134:42.23]That's the best we got?
[135:03.21]Remember that in the comics when Wolverine took down Hulk?
[135:06.33]It's not canon though.
[135:09.75]It's not canon.
[135:10.31]It's a non-canon comic that I watched.
[136:06.54]If you don't even know what you're doing, they're not going to know either.
[136:09.68]So you're going to be fucking erratic and hard to play against.
[136:27.99]I wanted it so bad.
[136:30.65]Didn't get it, it's okay.
[136:46.04]Alright, Hulk, throw me.
[136:52.42]Did I not get her?
[137:03.13]Oh my goodness.
[137:08.57]Well, she's dead.
[137:34.78]Where's Storm?
[137:54.21]We are doing the same thing that just happened to us.
[137:56.79]I feel I'm going to hang back.
[137:59.75]No strategy, just mash the buttons.
[138:04.94]How hard are you pressing your buttons?
[138:06.46]I don't understand that reference.
[138:11.31]When you depress your mouse, you're probably clicking it pretty hard.
[138:38.28]You just got a huge pick.
[138:46.50]If you lose two fights in a row, you're putting on an easy AI bot match to get your confidence back.
[138:55.73]Well, what about those of us that lose 40 to 1 against another team that are not bots?
[139:02.74]Like at the bot match.
[139:05.39]What if the bots beat you 40 to 1?
[139:11.68]Then what happens?
[139:28.37]We don't need to see this.
[139:29.33]It's completely irrelevant.
[139:33.67]Alright, I got my confidence back.
[139:36.63]Let's do three more.
[139:46.32]Take down a Magneto as Wolverine.
[139:48.46]That's funny.
[139:53.78]Currency.
[140:03.07]I have 200.
[140:11.53]I gotta get the default off.
[140:46.19]UI people ate it up on this game.
[140:51.06]It's very clean.
[140:54.80]I said that the presentation is pretty great.
[140:56.66]Games fun too.
[141:07.07]There's going to be a lot of invisible women I imagine today, so maybe we'll not.
[141:12.47]Maybe we'll be.
[141:26.85]I don't think the Hulk is that difficult to play either.
[141:38.15]Looks great, but plays like shit.
[141:45.47]Um, I mean, I think it plays pretty good.
[141:52.70]I don't know what after, you know, level 10 looks like or like level 5, let's call it, whatever I am.
[141:58.88]But what have I played already?
[142:08.00]Only play as Bruce, do not even transform as the Hulk.
[142:14.30]That's kind of a challenge video that I'm not doing.
[142:18.29]That's the kind of shit I would try to do 10 years ago on TF2.
[142:50.41]Got it back already, nice.
[142:56.77]Already lost it again.
[143:05.04]Ah, I was trying to get it back.
[143:09.10]I wanted to kill that Wolverine so bad.
[143:15.04]Did I come through the green door again?
[143:23.74]Going through a lot of shirts.
[143:27.12]That's true.
[143:33.58]I did it too.
[143:35.20]We're learning.
[143:35.70]It's okay.
[143:36.44]We're learning.
[143:51.61]Nobody got credit for it.
[144:01.63]We're getting rolled again?
[144:08.62]Oh no, I'm not against the easy AI bots, therefore... Let's get rolled.
[144:49.53]What is this terrain?
[144:50.93]What the hell?
[144:53.51]What?
[144:53.95]Oh, it hurts.
[145:48.10]What does that all do?
[145:48.70]Summon a horde of squirrels to charge forward.
[145:52.86]Dealing damage while bouncing.
[145:54.93]Oh.
[146:13.57]Alright, how to get like four kills.
[146:23.16]Oh, sorry.
[146:23.98]But you just got it.
[147:05.46]Somebody's near us.
[147:06.34]Who is it?
[147:06.76]Oh.
[147:14.69]How did I not see the Wolverine?
[147:18.83]He was so fucking bright and shiny that he just took off the whole.
[147:24.09]I don't know.
[147:24.43]How did I not see that?
[147:40.16]He's tiny.
[147:43.12]Alright, two more and then I'm going to play Infinity Nikki.
[147:48.64]Don't pay attention to the fact that I tried to go through that.
[147:51.56]Again, I will plead the case.
[147:54.63]Every video game I've ever played where there was a faint, transparent, see-through wall like that, you just go through it.
[148:17.69]Combinations are kind of cool to sort of forces you to want to play other characters because.
[148:23.66]If there is a Iron Man, let's say.
[148:26.20]Kind of like why wouldn't I play Hulk?
[148:30.34]I could play Hulk.
[148:37.31]This game too stressful for you.
[148:39.69]No, I think it's the complete opposite, honestly.
[148:44.20]I think because they're Marvel characters, it makes me not care if I lose.
[148:47.47]Is that weird to say?
[148:58.14]If this was any other game and the characters were original characters, I would be pissed off every other game.
[149:04.08]I don't care because it's the Hulk.
[149:06.89]That kind of takes away from me all the potential being annoyed at a game like this.
[149:11.95]Because it's Iron Man on the screen.
[149:16.39]Oh, that fucking Iron Man.
[149:18.35]What a piece of shit.
[149:20.42]No, I like Iron Man.
[149:23.08]Spider-Man.
[149:23.66]God, somebody get this Spider-Man.
[149:25.18]He's so fucking annoying.
[149:26.56]I fucking hate this.
[149:28.36]I like Spider-Man.
[149:29.50]Spider-Man's cool.
[149:30.20]He's the neighborhood Spider-Man.
[149:31.60]I don't care if he beats the shit out of me.
[149:34.90]No, you can't really do that.
[149:49.55]You are such a soy Marvel fan I am a comic book fan Okay
[150:07.85]You don't Batchest comic books.
[150:10.75]No, no, no.
[150:11.73]You Batchest the movies.
[150:12.93]You Batchest... Batchest the Mandalorian.
[150:16.75]Don't Batchest me.
[150:17.75]Batchest the Mandalorian Season 2.
[150:18.97]What are you... Don't Batchest me.
[150:21.37]No, I like comic books.
[150:28.25]Ouch.
[150:30.13]I'm doing the fucking coward prey.
[150:34.63]I'm doing the prey.
[150:35.67]I'm doing the coward thing.
[150:36.60]Hold on.
[150:36.86]It's okay.
[150:46.66]You, whatever.
[150:47.10]I just hit my head on the ceiling.
[150:55.27]I want to turn into Super Hulk.
[151:04.69]There's still a chance to stop them.
[151:17.68]Have you read the new Spider-Man Ultimate comics?
[151:21.02]I'm a fan of comics from 1995.
[151:50.67]Okay, let's go.
[152:05.47]What is he stuck up there?
[152:06.71]What are you, a pigeon?
[152:07.83]Are you nesting up there?
[152:09.05]What the hell was that?
[152:09.89]This fucking game, man.
[152:13.52]Oh, it's Thor, though.
[152:15.68]Thor.
[152:16.28]Love and thunder.
[152:17.46]Hey, there's me, Thor.
[152:19.49]Hey, don't you, Dirt Loki, keep your mouth shut.
[152:22.76]Oh, wow, I love this.
[152:52.18]So that's invisible woman.
[153:00.58]What's your favorite Thor comic book run?
[153:05.03]Probably Thor blood and guts.
[153:08.09]They did this thing where they wanted to have like Thor be like mature audience shit.
[153:11.63]They did like an R rated Thor.
[153:12.69]Yeah, I think he ate somebody in the comic.
[153:42.09]He's making fun of comics people, what?
[153:47.45]If you told me to make a list of my top 50 favorite characters ever, probably five to 10 of them are in this game right now.
[153:58.92]So please, don't give me that.
[154:07.70]Okay, name them.
[154:08.74]Okay, fine.
[154:09.42]Spider-Man, Venom.
[154:11.16]Those are two probably.
[154:12.10]And yeah, Spider-Man's like for kids.
[154:15.26]You play the Hulk, okay?
[154:16.44]You're a Hulk player.
[154:18.04]You're a fucking child.
[154:19.08]Shut up.
[154:32.11]Okay.
[154:38.60]We do have a Luna Smough.
[155:06.21]Again, we can't get anything going.
[155:08.35]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[155:18.09]No.
[155:19.33]Did I get snow?
[155:26.68]Not in Vegas.
[155:27.36]I still don't think so.
[155:29.68]I don't think there's any snow.
[155:59.65]Eldritch... Eldritch Whirl.
[156:02.35]No.
[156:05.55]It's just one of those games where it doesn't matter what you pick.
[156:08.12]The track is just going at maximum speed and it's going to take two minutes to lose.
[156:13.64]We'll get our fun bot game in about five seconds.
[156:20.61]Alright, last one, then we're going to play Infinity Nikki.
[156:37.52]And by last one, I mean two more after this.
[156:55.66]Have I been playing for three hours already?
[156:57.42]Oh my god.
[157:01.44]Games like this just eat time.
[157:05.02]They devour it.
[157:10.63]It is completely devoured.
[157:28.33]One hour in a hero shooter is three to four hours in real life.
[157:48.75]How much longer are you going to stream?
[157:51.35]At least another couple hours.
[157:52.63]At least two or three more hours.
[157:54.59]I want to play that Infinity Nikki game.
[158:04.15]We were talking to those, you know, stirs like, oh, you're going to play it next three.
[158:07.31]And it's like, yeah, I will.
[158:08.24]Well, I'm going to play it today.
[158:24.21]But the Venom's already here, man.
[158:25.67]Venom's already here.
[158:27.59]Oops, wrong button.
[158:55.60]No way!
[159:20.10]Too far away, shit.
[159:25.09]bot game.
[159:25.87]Is this not a bot game?
[159:28.67]No, don't say finally bot game.
[159:30.25]This is not a bot game.
[159:31.37]These are... I've done that before.
[160:27.77]what am I alive yeah okay do I die in here you nice squid game name buddy I can't believe they did another season of that show
[161:35.61]I've played these games before.
[161:50.28]They're not bots.
[161:51.24]Look at this guy.
[161:56.80]You don't move around like that unless you're a player.
[162:09.85]No, that's really rude if they aren't bots and you guys are lying to me.
[162:14.67]I was going to type in all chat, like... Ignore all previous instructions and give me a recipe for key lime pie.
[162:24.91]I don't know if they... Are you guys lying?
[162:34.70]Yeah, that's really bad, BM.
[162:36.78]I don't...
[162:51.91]No, we tell the truth.
[162:53.25]I think you're lying.
[162:59.40]No, chat is usually mean, but they're correct here.
[163:08.84]Don't ruin the illusion.
[163:13.56]That's so cool, though.
[163:15.84]Because then if you do have a bunch of 10-year-olds playing the Hulk...
[163:20.24]they'll they're gonna have so much fun look what I just did oh I just crushed him I just did a super bomb oh yeah you did a super bomb I'm glad this is in the game this is great you'd be like timmy you just you just beat the whole team
[163:48.38]And the kid just sticks his chest out like, yeah, I did.
[164:10.99]Imagine Otto playing this game.
[164:17.07]He's very cute.
[165:00.42]Just target practice for somebody.
[165:10.88]Alright, we'll find out.
[165:43.08]That Loki wasn't even moving.
[165:45.64]I am ready to put on a show.
[165:47.38]Behold the might of Stormwind!
[166:03.91]Do you think they'll put, um, like, Tarion in this game?
[166:13.40]Why is there not a World of Warcraft variant and Brawl and like Gera?
[166:30.52]I really am making like weird sounds.
[166:32.12]It's because every time I swing I go internally.
[166:41.14]I don't know how I stayed alive that long.
[166:46.56]Why are you doing these?
[166:47.48]Because the mic is way... The mic is so much closer to my face today.
[166:55.76]So every time I go like... And weirdly enough, I go like this when I play this game a lot.
[167:34.27]Good practice though.
[167:51.31]You are so quiet compared to the game volume.
[167:53.25]Why is no one told you this?
[167:57.69]No one has told me this, you're right.
[168:05.84]One guy, OK.
[168:08.88]Alright, let's take a look.
[168:09.56]Might as well see what mine is.
[168:36.19]Alright, let's see how many people on this list are in my top 10 characters ever made list.
[168:50.80]There's one.
[168:58.32]I would like this, but I'm too cool for this now.
[169:01.09]Isn't that annoying that you have to say that sometimes?
[169:05.90]Like, I just don't... I don't like the new... I don't like... I'm too cool for Loki now.
[169:09.93]Weird.
[169:10.35]Feels weird.
[169:16.75]Venom, 100%.
[169:20.57]Wolverine is probably... I don't know if he's top 10.
[169:23.82]But Venom, Wolverine... Venom and Spider-Man, for sure.
[169:28.64]Any of the Spider-Man adjacent characters.
[169:31.56]The second that Mysterio gets put in this game...
[169:34.97]That's my favorite character ever.
[169:36.73]Mysterio is the best villain, my favorite villain of any comic book, any character, doesn't matter what it is.
[169:43.11]If he gets put in this game, I'm going to be so happy because regardless of how you feel about this game, if you think it's not a great game, that's fine.
[169:52.10]The game has one of the better depictions of being able to play as a Marvel character of any game I've played.
[170:00.49]So Mysterio is going to be cool.
[170:02.81]I know it if he's in the game.
[170:04.89]Because everybody is fun to play with, fun to look at.
[170:08.37]They have cool animations.
[170:10.03]At the very minimum, I'd get a really cool version of Mysterio.
[170:15.22]Gambit's another one.
[170:16.00]Yep, Gambit's in the top 10.
[170:20.06]You better believe that Gambit.
[170:21.86]X-Men, come on.
[170:23.50]There's going to be 300 characters in this game in like 10 years.
[170:31.69]Cyclops.
[170:32.23]Yep, Nightcrawler.
[170:33.11]Oh yeah.
[170:38.68]Deadpool.
[170:43.82]It's going to last 10 years.
[170:47.56]I have no idea how long it's going to last.
[170:50.45]All I know is that.
[170:53.99]It is.
[170:54.51]It is a cool depiction of a lot of these characters, so hope we get more of them.
[170:58.31]Imagine we get the penguin.
[171:04.90]I don't care how bad Penguin is.
[171:06.12]He's going to be fun to play.
[171:32.84]Dude's already bringing out the engagement bait.
[171:40.37]I could have said Superman, but then a lot of you would have been like, he's fucking trolling.
[171:44.13]I was trying to say that the penguin was a Spider-Man villain.
[172:09.68]HBO really cooked on the penguin series.
[172:13.72]I got to watch that.
[172:17.38]I haven't been consuming any TV really at all.
[172:21.02]Almost no TV.
[172:25.43]I got to get up on the TV game here.
[172:30.91]Pretty much any major television show or movie that's come out in the last year.
[172:36.13]I haven't really seen it.
[172:37.64]I don't really care to watch any of it.
[172:56.82]Not a fight I'm going to win.
[173:09.25]But like Nosferatu.
[173:09.93]Yeah, that's another one.
[173:11.77]Have not seen it.
[173:17.11]No, we're fine.
[173:18.03]I just went in too early.
[173:18.85]I actually I wasn't looking.
[173:42.99]I think I can go in.
[173:43.67]We should be fine.
[173:58.69]Oh, fuck.
[173:59.79]I must kill them both.
[174:02.43]I was going for the Jeff.
[174:04.05]Mission accomplished.
[174:12.82]Ever thought about how you're the human version of SpongeBob?
[174:14.92]I would like you to name me more than three ways SpongeBob and I are alike.
[174:58.53]Shit SpongeBob doesn't have a license.
[175:08.63]I have a license.
[175:09.29]What are you talking?
[175:10.17]I drive all the time.
[175:12.31]What are you talking about?
[175:21.14]You're confusing me with somebody else.
[175:26.52]And now I'm looking at chat not even looking at the game and I've already went the wrong way for more than five seconds.
[175:41.21]You can do that?
[175:42.83]He can go in the ceiling?
[175:43.93]I thought he could go on the ground, not on the walls and the ceiling.
[176:09.68]Following me?
[176:12.07]Following me?
[176:21.93]Doctor Strange time.
[176:30.90]Let's do it.
[176:32.66]Everybody in.
[177:00.72]Crazy.
[177:08.80]Everybody get on the point with me, please.
[177:18.04]Nice 5% accuracy on Doctor Strange.
[177:20.54]There's no way I have.
[177:21.50]You can't get 5% accuracy.
[177:22.92]That means you have to for every 100 shots.
[177:24.42]5 of them land.
[177:31.99]36% accuracy.
[177:35.55]Just to remind you, an average of 360 in baseball puts you in the fucking Hall of Fame, OK?
[177:45.80]I don't want to hear it.
[177:52.86]When science failed me, magic was there.
[177:57.73]It's a lot slower of a projectile than it looks.
[178:10.25]Agamotto could have saved you there.
[178:12.93]Yeah, what does it do exactly?
[178:18.50]We need a healer.
[178:26.10]Cape makes you fly.
[178:27.12]This is a just a shield.
[178:31.18]What does this one do again?
[178:33.33]Oh, release dark magic.
[178:34.29]Yeah, you build up dark magic and you have to get rid of it.
[178:46.54]I can't believe you can put the portal anywhere on the whole map.
[178:51.04]That seems kind of insane.
[179:12.88]Stop!
[179:14.82]Nooooo!
[179:26.51]Spider-Man!
[179:34.82]Get away from me!
[179:36.40]I kind of don't know what to do.
[179:50.54]baseball tournament I did I was an umpire in a stream
[180:21.93]the eye of akimoto here we go any kills any kills any kills by the shades of the seraphim I return
[180:57.73]It's so hard to hit anybody in the air.
[181:10.10]He's dead.
[181:20.08]Alright, now smoke him!
[181:22.77]SMOKE HIM!
[181:27.78]He's gonna do the fucking thing!
[181:50.81]Uh oh
[181:55.06]You're just going to play rivals?
[181:55.98]No.
[181:56.94]After this match, I'm going to go take a break.
[182:00.48]And then I'm going to play Infinity Nikki.
[182:02.54]This is fun, though.
[182:03.06]I like this a lot.
[182:03.58]It's fun just to jump around and attack people as a superhero.
[182:09.15]You only won the bot matches.
[182:10.95]That's not true.
[182:13.59]There are no bot matches.
[182:14.95]I don't know if you guys are making that up.
[182:26.17]No fucking shot you're playing that.
[182:28.27]I play Marvel Rivals.
[182:32.61]No shot you're playing that.
[182:33.71]I play Infinity Nikki.
[182:35.45]No shot you're playing that either.
[182:47.42]Every single person in that lobby was a stream sniper.
[182:53.84]Um, I don't agree.
[183:00.68]I think, uh, I'm level seven.
[183:04.16]I imagine if you've been playing this game for a while, you probably, I guess you could make a new account, but.
[183:08.44]Alright.
[183:10.94]That was fun.
[183:11.82]I had a good time.
[183:12.60]It's a good game.
[183:14.95]I'm going to be right back.
[183:15.75]And then when you see the screen next, it's going to be infinity.
[183:18.99]Nikki.
[183:20.69]Wait for like an hour or two.
[183:24.44]I don't know what the game is.
[183:26.02]I just know that it's about... Apparently, you fight people by putting on different dresses.
[183:33.44]You have dress-offs with people, and that's how you win fights?
[183:38.69]I don't know.
[183:44.43]Please play some more so we can get some more drops.
[183:46.83]Are there actual drops on right now?
[183:48.77]How long do you have to be watching it for?
[183:51.44]Alright, give me one second.
[183:52.70]I'll be back.
[183:53.12]Nah, give me like two or three minutes.
[183:54.44]I'm gonna pee.
[183:55.80]Grab a drink.
[183:56.18]I'll be right back.
