[00:04.81]I can't even put into words how upset I am right now.
[00:08.53]I missed the wine convention by two hours, and I bought this special red wine suit to prove how much I love wine, and now what am I supposed to do, throw it in the trash?
[00:19.05]Oh, hey, German!
[00:19.53]Get the fuck out of here!
[00:22.43]By the way, can I just say, we both look like fucking idiots.
[00:28.85]You look like a Dead Rising character.
[00:31.01]Look at how I'm leaning in.
[00:32.69]Can I not hear him?
[00:34.89]What's he saying?
[00:36.09]Okay, yeah, I got it.
[00:37.99]I gotta be real close.
[00:39.15]I don't hear so well no more.
[00:41.73]I look like I just work at a movie theater.
[00:43.75]You do.
[00:44.05]You look like an usher.
[00:47.28]What's with the Gatorade tattoo you have on your arm?
[00:51.46]That's supposed to be a Spidey lightning bolt.
[00:53.62]That's a fucking Gatorade logo.
[00:55.50]No.
[01:01.57]You're doing the hacking.
[01:02.45]Okay, so now I'm the hacker.
[01:03.74]Got it.
[01:05.04]I'll do the hacking.
[01:07.02]So on the way there, I gotta hack the system.
[01:13.10]Not easy.
[01:17.34]Fucking... No!
[01:18.72]Shit!
[01:20.42]What, did we lose the height?
[01:25.20]Don't make me laugh.
[01:26.56]Don't make me laugh.
[01:33.67]You don't sneeze like a fucking dickhead.
[01:36.74]Give me a second.
[01:37.56]That's how you sneeze.
[01:39.82]I can't fail it again.
[01:40.66]I failed it again.
[01:43.20]Hold on.
[01:43.84]I actually have to blow my nose right now.
[01:45.26]Let's go.
[01:47.52]This is a fucking stick-up.
[01:52.70]Another block.
[01:54.28]Good idea.
[01:55.22]Real good idea.
[01:56.84]That's not so much of a good idea, except I think it might have just worked.
[02:01.11]Holy shit, how the hell did you pull that off?
[02:03.51]It was like Dukes of Hazzard.
[02:05.59]You just did like a Tony Hawk Ollie off of a wall.
[02:09.85]Okay, I gotta admit, that was pretty impressive, but can you do it again?
[02:15.06]Just like squeezed right there.
[02:17.08]Yeah, that was nice.
[02:17.64]That was nice, man.
[02:19.24]I think we're gonna blow up this bridge.
[02:20.68]What?
[02:21.48]Alright, we're looking at the bridge here.
[02:26.18]Is there a helicopter there?
[02:27.12]Do we have to destroy the helicopter?
[02:29.16]No, that's for us.
[02:30.78]What do you mean that's for us?
[02:33.44]It's magnetizing us to it.
[02:35.32]We're gonna get sucked up by a super magnet?
[02:41.85]Oh, did you just get out?
[02:44.11]Did you get out of the car?
[02:46.11]Oh my gosh.
[02:47.86]There he is.
[02:48.48]That's the guy that's killing all the people.
[02:49.72]That's the red lobster serial killer.
[02:51.90]I've seen him.
[02:52.44]Get him down.
[02:52.94]Kill him.
[02:53.16]Kill him, guys.
[02:54.36]Open fire, boys.
[02:55.40]He's murdered again.
[02:56.68]We'll take him down.
[02:57.44]I want an APB put out of this guy.
[02:59.16]We're not going to stop until he's here.
[03:00.62]Where'd he go?
[03:01.70]Where is he?
[03:03.25]I don't remember anything.
[03:04.95]Can anyone remember anything?
[03:06.11]I don't remember.
[03:06.85]There's nine bullets discharged from my gun.
[03:09.23]Why did I do that?
[03:10.41]All I remember is I'm the bad cop.
[03:13.97]I think I'm a bad cop.
[03:16.31]I'm going to go home.
[03:20.27]I'm in the prison bus.
[03:21.09]I'm just gonna drive.
[03:22.13]Alright, we're all behind you.
[03:25.73]What is this car doing?
[03:26.71]This isn't even a cop that just ran me.
[03:28.19]Yeah, there's like speed demons on the road for some fucked up reason.
[03:34.23]Did somebody fly out of the sky?
[03:37.57]Oh, I don't want to go in here.
[03:38.49]I actually screwed.
[03:41.58]What was that?
[03:42.46]Why did the guy just fall from the sky?
[03:46.32]You need to kill this helicopter.
[03:49.88]Perfect.
[03:53.24]Very, very nice.
[03:54.20]I hope we don't blow this thing.
[03:55.36]Oh, there's a helicopter right in front of us.
[03:57.66]Oh, and this thing's upside down.
[03:59.00]We're just sliding down.
[04:02.01]Come on.
[04:02.65]Actually, oh, wow.
[04:05.33]Holy shit.
[04:06.03]Did that seriously just end up working in our favor?
[04:12.63]That can't be serious right now, right?
[04:14.56]No, we're going to get found.
[04:16.73]We're not found.
[04:18.43]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[04:19.43]Shut up.
[04:19.81]Oh, they've had us.
[04:20.29]Fuck!
[04:23.30]I mean, in full uniform, but... Shit.
[04:27.70]Take a right at the street.
[04:29.18]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:33.10]Oh, fuck.
[04:33.90]That's not the street.
[04:34.78]Just take a right.
[04:35.50]You're still fine.
[04:36.26]He's in between.
[04:37.31]Oh, come on.
[04:40.15]Hold X to duck.
[04:42.89]Hold X. Hold X. You're not holding it.
[04:45.55]We're in some guy's garage.
[04:49.27]Oh my gosh, they're coming.
[04:51.07]They're not going to see us.
[04:52.31]They're not going to see us.
[04:53.13]They're coming down the street.
[04:54.19]We're hiding in a garage.
[04:55.15]They can't even see.
[04:55.96]Oh my gosh.
[04:57.08]It worked.
[04:58.93]You're not even in my car.
[05:00.25]Oh, you're in the back.
[05:01.27]Hold on, let me get in there.
[05:07.98]I'm so glad that worked.
[05:09.06]He just pulled into his garage.
[05:10.74]Yeah, we like ran into that guy.
[05:12.40]That guy could have just called the police.
[05:14.02]He's on the ground, dead.
[05:15.30]No, he's not.
[05:16.58]That guy ran in his house.
[05:17.85]He probably could have just called the police and been like, are you looking for a guy in a cop car?
[05:21.95]He just like hit me and is hiding in my garage.
[05:26.98]There's a car that's going to pull up here in a second.
[05:29.26]This one right here.
[05:30.20]Two guys are going to get out.
[05:32.54]And you have to pick who you want to shoot.
[05:34.42]Because we have to shoot them both at the same time.
[05:36.26]How long do we have?
[05:37.80]Like, now.
[05:38.38]Ready?
[05:38.58]I'm going to get the guy on the right.
[05:39.68]You ready?
[05:40.04]Sure.
[05:41.27]3, 2, 1, shoot.
[05:43.07]Now, we've got to get the briefcase.
[05:47.21]Oh, no!
[05:48.91]You did it!
[05:55.04]I thought since you did this before, this was the surefire way to do it.
[05:59.31]Just hold on a second, I have to go get some snacks.
[06:02.55]Sir, do you have any Butterfingers or Eggo waffles here?
[06:05.65]I'm craving them.
[06:07.97]Put all the money in the register.
[06:10.42]Hurry up, make it snappy.
[06:11.72]Oh, I thought this was a handgun.
[06:15.12]Do they really just have- I'm sorry!
[06:17.92]I just wanted some snacks!
[06:20.36]I see the guy in the plane.
[06:22.30]Yeah, what is his job?
[06:23.16]Is he just like kind of circling around?
[06:24.50]I'm not sure what he's supposed to do, but he's supposed to pick us up.
[06:26.73]He's our getaway.
[06:29.35]All right, we're about to park.
[06:31.83]I'm not supposed to get out of the car.
[06:32.91]You're supposed to pull me out.
[06:34.01]No, you're my prisoner.
[06:35.21]I take you out, so you're in handcuffs.
[06:37.01]Get out of here, you fucking scumbag.
[06:41.99]Don't worry, I got this.
[06:43.03]I got this, asshole.
[06:45.21]So you have to walk.
[06:47.05]Don't do anything insane.
[06:56.15]No!
[06:57.99]You idiot!
[07:00.13]Why did you do that?
[07:03.01]We can still do it.
[07:03.85]We can still do it.
[07:06.09]I mean, this can be the hardest thing in the world, but we can still do it.
[07:10.36]Hold on.
[07:11.20]We need to go.
[07:11.82]We need to go.
[07:14.10]A little premature.
[07:17.14]Holy shit, did that guy just jump?
[07:18.88]Fucking kill them both!
[07:21.58]Oh my gosh.
[07:23.79]You just totally screwed us.
[07:25.13]I know.
[07:28.59]I can't believe we're actually still alive.
[07:30.85]I don't even know what we're doing now.
[07:32.85]You need to start shooting people.
[07:33.81]I haven't seen you shoot your gun one time.
[07:35.60]We have to get the prisoner out of there.
[07:38.18]You died, dude.
[07:42.42]There's no, like, marker, is there?
[07:45.70]I'll mark it for you.
[07:49.06]No, we're supposed to think of the airplane.
[07:53.65]That's a cop helicopter, I think.
[07:56.81]Is it?
[07:57.11]I died.
[07:58.75]I got just destroyed from behind.
[08:01.25]Did you have to come back?
[08:01.89]I hope- Hopefully- Oh, Jesus, man.
[08:03.65]It just spawned me in such a stupid spot.
[08:08.39]Holy shit.
[08:09.59]Oh my god.
[08:11.01]Oh dear god, dude.
[08:13.97]Oh my fucking god, this is horrible.
[08:16.47]We might- We're gonna lose.
[08:18.43]I'm shooting just rockets in like every direction and we're dead.
[08:25.30]Okay, why?
[08:27.30]Why would it spawn me in the middle of the fucking street with like nine cruisers and four helicopters?
