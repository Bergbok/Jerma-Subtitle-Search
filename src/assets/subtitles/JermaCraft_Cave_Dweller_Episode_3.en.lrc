[00:02.32]Why, hello there.
[00:04.42]Welcome to another episode of JermaCraft.
[00:08.22]And as you can see, I'm doing a little bit of renovating.
[00:11.14]Doing some renovations on the house.
[00:14.02]If you could tell.
[00:16.22]Because this thing is a mess.
[00:17.46]Just trying to clean it up a little bit.
[00:19.32]And, oh my god, no, this has happened before.
[00:22.98]Don't worry, got it under control.
[00:26.86]So I changed the brightness to be a little brighter.
[00:30.08]And I also made...
[00:32.39]The black bars on the sides of the video, that's probably gone now.
[00:37.13]At least I'm hoping they are, because they were kind of annoying on the top and bottom.
[00:41.31]So let's do some adventuring.
[00:42.84]I already did a little bit of... I did some stuff before we started.
[00:46.04]I got some torches.
[00:47.32]I got a couple of tools.
[00:49.14]Got a little bit of iron.
[00:51.26]And it's time to go on an adventure.
[00:54.31]Iron sword.
[00:54.97]Already got a shovel.
[00:56.91]Got a pick.
[00:59.50]I got some rotten flesh.
[01:01.32]I don't even know what this thing is.
[01:02.38]What the hell is a slime ball?
[01:04.02]What does that do?
[01:06.06]No idea.
[01:08.80]Let's get another pick.
[01:11.34]Just because I know I'll probably need it.
[01:15.26]Two shovels, a sword, a bunch of sticks.
[01:20.11]I need to make... Do I have enough?
[01:23.59]I do not have enough.
[01:25.59]Shoot.
[01:29.31]Ah, alright.
[01:31.51]I think that'll be alright.
[01:33.62]I gotta get... I want to put this iron away.
[01:35.04]Alright, that's next on the agenda.
[01:37.70]You know what?
[01:38.14]Screw this.
[01:39.44]I'm just taking it off the house.
[01:42.16]I'm cutting down my preliminary wall.
[01:46.22]So I can make a case so I don't lose all my items if I die.
[01:51.26]Because that is a real big pain in the ass.
[01:57.67]Okay, okay, okay, let's make... Alright.
[02:05.00]There it is!
[02:05.62]A chest!
[02:07.04]A golden chest!
[02:10.12]Put it right here.
[02:12.06]Put half the coal in there, put the iron in there.
[02:15.33]The slime ball.
[02:17.33]And the sticks.
[02:19.53]I got a bunch of sand, dude, what the hell am I gonna do with that?
[02:23.11]Okay, so now if I die, it's not a complete and total waste of time.
[02:27.73]Let's go.
[02:30.38]Try to find some kind of cave system here.
[02:33.64]Because I had some iron from before.
[02:35.20]I found a little bit of iron before.
[02:40.08]Keep going.
[02:42.53]We'll go this way now.
[02:43.33]We'll dig straight this way.
[02:46.49]You never know what you're going to run into in JermaCraft.
[02:50.93]Or Minecraft for that matter.
[02:55.03]By the way, the music in this game is really, really good.
[03:00.27]The composer's name is, what, like C3, something like that.
[03:03.15]It's some kind of crazy stage name he has.
[03:06.14]He's a talented guy.
[03:07.76]Because this stuff is really, really soothing.
[03:10.66]He nailed it.
[03:11.78]He absolutely nailed it.
[03:16.24]Mining coal.
[03:18.92]Mining coal.
[03:21.46]We gotta keep going forward and keep going below the coal.
[03:26.52]Mine is steel.
[03:29.08]Mine is steel.
[03:31.66]We gotta mine that steel and mine that cobblestone.
[03:36.56]Where the hell am I even going?
[03:40.54]Alright, let's go.
[03:41.74]I will find something before this pick breaks.
[03:46.13]Or it'll kill me.
[03:50.53]Oh yeah.
[03:51.79]Aimlessly digging around.
[03:54.15]Best part about Minecraft.
[03:58.10]Ooh, he found a little bit of coal.
[04:07.01]That's good.
[04:07.67]Ooh.
[04:16.06]I will definitely take you.
[04:18.04]And you.
[04:19.24]And you.
[04:20.60]I'm gonna give you all names, too.
[04:22.26]Your name's gonna be Coley.
[04:24.88]Your name's gonna be Steamy.
[04:28.09]And your name's going to be Diarrhea.
[04:32.14]Because that's what you kind of look like.
[04:34.10]Diarrhea!
[04:37.34]Oh, there's a lot of coal here.
[04:38.30]Uh-oh, I think I'm going to get lost.
[04:42.80]I think I already am lost.
[04:47.29]Ladies and gentlemen, we found gravel.
[04:52.05]Which means... Alright.
[04:59.38]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[05:01.89]Alright, enough gravel.
[05:04.85]We got a lava pit.
[05:07.43]What else is in here?
[05:10.33]Okay.
[05:11.11]Ooh, that goes down.
[05:12.23]I'm going to block this off.
[05:14.75]This is really risky, and I hope I don't die.
[05:17.23]Ooh!
[05:20.88]Okay.
[05:21.68]Nice.
[05:22.46]Nice.
[05:25.30]And there goes the lava.
[05:26.54]It is now disappearing.
[05:27.44]Let's see if I can... Ooh, I see iron.
[05:29.74]I see iron.
[05:33.80]I'm going to accidentally fall on this.
[05:35.28]I know it.
[05:39.24]I'm going to accidentally spill it.
[05:41.42]Just like a hot cup of coffee on my new pair of pants.
[05:46.28]Alright, I think that should be good.
[05:50.96]Give me that iron.
[05:54.60]Only one?
[05:55.28]There was only one thing of iron there.
[05:58.24]You gotta be kidding me.
[06:00.90]I do not approve of that.
[06:02.18]Yeah, right.
[06:03.69]One iron.
[06:04.31]How unlucky is that?
[06:07.41]Oh, well.
[06:10.81]Ooh.
[06:12.49]There's even more.
[06:15.00]I got a sword this time, so you're... Ooh, more iron.
[06:18.64]Let me get this first.
[06:23.76]Alright, so this is a big, intricate little cave system.
[06:26.64]Big, intricate little cave.
[06:28.96]I like the sound of that.
[06:30.78]Oh, hi there, guys.
[06:32.52]You didn't think I had a sword this time, did you?
[06:36.30]Goodbye.
[06:37.74]And thanks for coming.
[06:39.66]Oh, I don't think you understand.
[06:40.54]I got a sword this time.
[06:41.75]I'm not messing around anymore.
[06:43.09]I'm hungry, too, apparently.
[06:45.07]You're dead.
[06:47.15]What is he... Is there lava?
[06:48.35]Yeah, there's lava over there.
[06:50.38]Alright, I need to eat this rotten, disgusting flesh.
[06:53.21]Hold on.
[06:55.55]Can you puke in this game?
[06:57.25]Because I would definitely puke from eating this.
[07:01.97]Oh, like... What?
[07:02.81]What's going on?
[07:03.90]What's going on?
[07:05.38]Am I, like, toxic?
[07:06.30]Am I gonna die?
[07:06.92]Oh, God.
[07:10.16]This is great.
[07:11.88]Now I have, like, toxic green blood.
[07:14.92]Are you serious?
[07:17.45]What the hell?
[07:18.79]What are you doing?
[07:21.26]Dude, you are, like, levitating right now.
[07:23.04]Do you need some help or something?
[07:24.64]Yeah, you need some help.
[07:29.37]Oh, okay.
[07:30.49]I don't have any more picks, do I?
[07:31.51]Nope.
[07:32.65]Time to make the trek back.
[07:35.57]Hopefully I can find my way.
[07:37.77]Or else I am... Look at this sneaky... Whoa!
[07:43.95]Okay, that... Okay, really?
[07:45.07]No!
[07:47.97]Oh... My...
[07:50.88]God.
[07:52.86]You have... You've got to be kidding me.
[07:57.61]That was... How is that even possible?
[08:01.43]There were two creepers sitting in, like, the same exact spot together in the same pixel?
[08:08.87]Oh, my God.
[08:10.04]Oh, my God.
[08:14.54]Look at this sneaky
[08:20.45]Okay, that, okay, really?
[08:23.62]Okay.
