[00:02.01]Yo what's happening guys, Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:07.86]Playing as the sniper tonight with the Machina.
[00:11.18]Never done a Machina gameplay, a lot of you guys asked me for this and I finally have done it.
[00:16.38]So it's the Machina, the Darwin's Danger Shield and the Tribalman Shiv I believe.
[00:21.91]I die once or twice in the beginning here and after that I just start mowing people down like crazy, headshot after headshot, it's pretty awesome.
[00:29.55]So why I never use the Machina and why I've never done a Machina gameplay?
[00:34.60]Everybody always tells me, Jerma, the Machina is the best sniper rifle in the game.
[00:38.72]Hands down, why wouldn't you use it?
[00:40.26]Just equip it for crying out loud.
[00:42.63]And the reason why I never use it, guys, is because I can't handle the line that comes out of the gun.
[00:49.17]That might sound weird, but it has nothing to do with giving away my position.
[00:54.32]What bothers me about it is the fact that I can't really see that well.
[00:58.56]It sort of messes with my aim, because I'll shoot somebody, and if I miss, this big bright line comes right in my face, and my ADHD kicks in, and I just focus on that, and then I get shot, I just can't recuperate.
[01:10.42]So I can't use this gun mainly because of that line.
[01:14.16]The second reason why I can't use this weapon is the no hip fire.
[01:18.90]I can't take it.
[01:19.52]Because I'm one of those people that if a spy is around, I'm much more satisfied and much safer shooting him from the hip rather than going in and getting face stabbed.
[01:28.41]So not being able to hip fire really, really sucks.
[01:32.61]And I know a lot of you guys are going to tell me, well, Jerma, equip the machine gun, the SMG.
[01:36.39]That's a perfect combination.
[01:38.59]It's just the SMG has such weird hit detection.
[01:41.94]It seems like when you use the SMG and you shoot somebody, half the time the bullets don't even register landing on the person.
[01:47.98]It's just really odd.
[01:49.06]I don't like the hit detection on that weapon, so I don't like to use it.
[01:52.71]But all in all, this gun is very, very good for killing people who are over-healed.
[01:58.16]This is the over-healer killer.
[02:00.64]Kind of a mouthful, I know.
[02:03.14]You can kill people that are over-healed with a body shot with this gun.
[02:07.36]Any of the smaller classes, a scout, a sniper, spy, even a medic, you can still body shot them and potentially kill them with a fully charged body shot, which that was not the case with the older sniper rifle.
[02:19.31]So one of the only tips I can really give you with this gun, because honestly I don't really use it that often, is you have to be patient.
[02:26.36]This is the patient man's sniper rifle.
[02:29.10]You can't just go shooting like a Texas Longhorn.
[02:32.18]I don't even know what that is.
[02:33.72]But you can't just shoot all over the place.
[02:35.54]You need to really time your shots, because guys, you're giving away your position every time you shoot the gun.
[02:40.88]And to touch upon that for a second,
[02:43.10]If you stay in the same position for long enough, you are gonna get found out, people are gonna start to shoot at you, people are gonna start coming after you.
[02:50.65]So move around a lot, guys.
[02:51.95]Don't stand in the same position for more than 20 or 30 seconds.
[02:56.01]And I know I don't do that at all in this gameplay.
[02:58.09]I'm standing in the same spot, but that's because this is on Gold Rush.
[03:02.11]And Gold Rush really only has, like, two or three places a sniper can even stand in the first place.
[03:08.04]But on a big map like Upward or Badwater or something like that, you really need to move around.
[03:13.14]So there you go.
[03:13.74]There's my rant on the Machina.
[03:16.18]Gonna talk about the gameplay, what's going on on the screen now while there's still time.
[03:21.32]So I just walk out the back door here, go pick up this health.
[03:24.69]I love this health pack.
[03:26.21]This is the best health pack in the game.
[03:28.61]Just because it's a full health pack, it's right there, right around that choke point.
[03:32.13]I love it so much.
[03:33.95]Coming back to this window here, bad idea.
[03:36.53]Almost get myself killed for a second time.
[03:39.23]And you would think I learned my lesson right here, but I do not.
[03:42.27]Get some health, come back over to that same window.
[03:45.01]I want to get that Demoman.
[03:46.89]Whether it kills me or not, I don't care.
[03:48.63]I want to get him.
[03:49.75]There he is right there.
[03:50.77]I don't get the shot on him.
[03:52.07]He's too well protected by that wall.
[03:54.59]Sniper just dies.
[03:55.99]I don't know whether he had a heart attack, I think.
[03:58.97]So look at this, nobody's coming out, the heavy medic pair is up there doing work.
[04:02.76]There they are, I figured time to get out of this window.
[04:06.04]Jumping down I get right next to the cart because nobody's on it right now.
[04:09.27]This is a great opportunity to push the cart and nobody's on it.
[04:13.03]The plan is to stand next to the cart while you're zoomed in so you still get the cap points.
[04:18.50]Gets a little too dangerous to continue to do that, so I sit back here, try to get some spawn trap headshots.
[04:25.02]Think I get maybe one or two, and I end up going around the left side, cause action kinda dies down right here.
[04:31.17]Don't see anybody really coming out, I'm missing a lot of shots.
[04:34.05]So I take a left-handed turn over here, go around the left side, try to flank him a little bit.
[04:39.80]Ends up working out much, much better than this is right now.
[04:42.56]I take the turn in about 5 seconds here, go around the left side.
[04:45.54]I get a bunch of headshots after this.
[04:47.42]I get one shot in particular that I just couldn't believe I got it.
[04:51.28]I was like, wow.
[04:52.76]How the hell did I get that?
[04:54.44]It's an Engineer coming up right here.
[04:56.00]Get this Soldier.
[04:57.08]I believe I get this Pyro as well.
[04:58.73]There he is.
[04:59.37]Yoink.
[05:00.21]So it's an Engineer that I end up getting.
[05:01.79]I missed this Scout right here, but watch this.
[05:03.31]When I get this Engineer, I like perfectly track his head.
[05:07.01]Almost like I'm hacking or something, but I promise you I'm not hacking.
[05:10.18]I end up just getting it somehow.
[05:12.48]There it is right there.
[05:13.74]Perfectly tracked headshot on an engineer jumping around a corner.
[05:17.38]Jerma hack version 1.6.
[05:20.02]That is going to be the end of the gameplay.
[05:21.72]I get this last heavy.
[05:22.76]He's kind of just standing here.
[05:24.42]I missed the headshot right there, but I get him twice.
[05:26.78]One and two right there.
[05:28.70]Thank you all so much for watching.
[05:30.16]I really do appreciate it.
[05:31.70]I top frag in this gameplay, which is always fun, always cool.
[05:35.09]So if you like this video, go ahead and throw me a like.
[05:37.55]And I will see you guys all next time.
[05:39.69]Take care, everybody.
[05:43.36]Thank you.
