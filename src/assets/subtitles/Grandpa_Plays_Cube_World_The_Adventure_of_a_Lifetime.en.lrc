[00:08.21]Well, you have to put it in the pot for two hours.
[00:11.43]Yeah, but what's the temperature?
[00:12.67]It sits in the pot for two hours.
[00:14.19]You have to cook it for two hours, otherwise it's not going to work.
[00:16.51]I get it.
[00:16.69]What temperature does it have to be set at?
[00:18.31]It's a fucking pot roast.
[00:19.31]You can't screw it up.
[00:20.31]Get out.
[00:21.05]I'm doing a video.
[00:22.51]What's the... You need to tell me... Get out!
[00:24.05]Oh, Jesus.
[00:25.41]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27.55]It's Grandpa here.
[00:29.41]And today, I've got a special fucking video for you.
[00:33.58]Because I got access to Cube World.
[00:37.56]Okay, so this is Jerma's file.
[00:39.87]We can go ahead and fucking delete that.
[00:41.73]Start a new file for Grandpa's character.
[00:44.33]Let's get going there.
[00:45.25]Create.
[00:46.07]Click it, baby.
[00:47.59]Was that a guitar?
[00:49.13]I don't want to play the musician.
[00:50.91]What's this?
[00:51.27]A musician.
[00:52.49]We got ear musician.
[00:53.87]We got drunk guy.
[00:55.32]We got gremlin from Gremlins 2.
[00:56.84]It was a pretty good movie, but don't really want to play as a gremlin.
[01:00.90]We got the drunk goblin.
[01:02.52]I don't like the drunk goblin.
[01:03.74]The lizard.
[01:04.26]I like lizard people.
[01:05.86]I'm dead.
[01:06.28]I don't think I want to play.
[01:07.56]Fucking frog people.
[01:08.86]I'm playing as a fucking frog man.
[01:11.07]I'm not even going to go any further on the characters.
[01:14.47]So what you do in Minecraft is pretty simple.
[01:17.35]You go around and you collect resources and you fight months.
[01:21.49]What the hell is this?
[01:22.09]What the fuck is this?
[01:23.17]What is going on here?
[01:24.61]What is this, the Ninja Turtles?
[01:26.33]What the fuck are the Ninja Turtles doing in this game?
[01:28.87]Look, it's Leonardo.
[01:29.86]That's Donatello behind him.
[01:31.42]Get the... Ow!
[01:34.94]What do you do in this game?
[01:37.42]I don't... I have no... What am I supposed to even be doing?
[01:40.38]Does anybody know what you do in this game?
[01:43.76]I have not figured out... All I've done is... Was that a bee?
[01:48.10]It's a fucking bee!
[01:49.34]Come on, you bee bitch.
[01:51.42]You see, the real awesome part about this game is the fact that I'm battling right now as a frog.
[01:56.48]There's never been a game in existence where you could fight people as frogs.
[02:00.64]It just never existed, and that's why I like it.
[02:04.46]And that's it.
[02:05.10]Five experience points right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07.24]I just figured out how to play Cube World.
[02:11.02]I'm concerned about the people that made this game, because they're going to get fucking sued.
[02:15.47]First it's the Ninja Turtles, and then look, it's the Seven Dwarfs.
[02:18.71]Disney is going to have a field day with these guys.
[02:21.45]Look, that's Snuffy, that's Gruffy, that's Poopy and Snoopy.
[02:24.65]See, that's the Seven Dwarfs.
[02:26.82]How are they not going to get sued by this?
[02:29.77]I really am concerned.
[02:31.23]Let me go get a closer look here.
[02:33.17]Alright, Fluffy.
[02:34.37]You need to go back to Disney World.
[02:36.55]Because I said so.
[02:39.94]What?
[02:41.94]What the?
[02:43.36]They just melted me.
[02:45.68]The seven dwarves didn't have those fucking powers.
[02:50.34]Oh, would you look who it is, everybody?
[02:52.97]It's Donatello, by himself, without his boys.
[02:56.67]Hey, Donny, how are you?
[02:58.03]How are the rest of the Ninja Turtles?
[02:59.95]Yeah, without them, you aren't so fucking tough, now are you?
[03:03.07]Got something to say?
[03:05.19]I have my own house.
[03:08.33]Um, Donatello, I think you might have a brain injury.
[03:13.68]Somebody help me.
[03:14.46]Somebody please help me.
[03:15.51]I got a bunch of animals following me.
[03:17.45]I got like two animal bug birds.
[03:20.19]What are you doing?
[03:22.05]What are you doing?
[03:22.55]Leave him alone.
[03:23.53]What did he do?
[03:25.60]Why did they do that to him?
[03:26.94]You bullies.
[03:27.90]You savages.
[03:29.24]You beasts.
[03:30.72]No, leave him alone.
[03:31.72]All he wanted was some bird seed.
[03:33.53]I have it in my pocket.
[03:34.99]What about this bird?
[03:35.77]This bird's like, fuck that.
[03:36.91]I want nothing to do with this.
[03:38.61]He has absolutely nothing to do with this.
[03:40.61]Well, it looks like all your friends are dead.
[03:42.39]He's like, fuck that, dude.
[03:44.03]Alright, I guess I'll help you, you know, whatever.
[03:46.03]I can't believe I'm still ch- I'm dead.
[03:48.68]Oh, Jesus!
[03:54.82]Okay, I kind of feel bad about what just happened.
[04:00.08]How did I end up in a tree?
[04:02.23]What?
[04:03.80]Hello, Mr. Peacock.
[04:04.86]How are you?
[04:05.47]How are you doing today?
[04:06.39]Yes, I smell good.
[04:07.39]Thank you.
[04:08.35]Um, got some trouble here.
[04:09.91]Oh, my God.
[04:11.27]Kick his ass.
[04:12.69]Kick his fucking ass.
[04:13.88]Look at this animation.
[04:15.10]Look at this awesome animation.
[04:16.64]He's skiing at him.
[04:17.98]Look at this.
[04:18.80]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[04:20.00]You are... Oh, he died.
[04:22.79]Now I'm sad.
[04:24.87]I keep killing birds in this game.
[04:27.13]I feel terrible.
[04:28.51]I'm a bird killer.
[04:29.88]But to be fair here, guys, he did do that on his own.
[04:34.16]I didn't ask him to.
[04:35.54]He just flipped the fuck out and started skiing at the guy.
[04:38.80]And you know what?
[04:39.50]That's what we shoot the clouds.
[04:42.02]I like this game.
[04:44.30]Some kind of encampment over here.
[04:46.32]Looks like there could be some food and some supplies.
[04:49.08]There is nothing special.
[04:50.28]Well, there is some stuff here.
[04:52.58]Is this yours?
[04:54.25]Hey, Mr. Swim Man, hey, come on up here.
[04:56.31]I wanna talk to you.
[04:57.01]Do you own this camp?
[04:58.79]How did you build this?
[05:01.09]Come on up here.
[05:01.67]You wanna make some food and stuff?
[05:03.93]We could be friends.
[05:05.67]Nope, okay, don't wanna be friends.
[05:07.75]You just dug your own grave.
[05:09.98]See you later.
[05:11.00]Get fucking rapid fired.
[05:13.88]That's how you do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[05:15.30]You take his money, and then you go back and you take his food, too.
[05:19.54]That pineapple is mine.
[05:21.98]You had your chance to be friendly.
[05:24.64]Just wanted to share.
[05:25.62]Mmm, this is gonna taste real good, baby.
[05:29.64]Mmm, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
