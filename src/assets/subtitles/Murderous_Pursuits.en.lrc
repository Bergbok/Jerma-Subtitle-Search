[00:01.53]I do have what guess what's loaded up in the background here Okay, let's open the next game.
[00:06.83]You didn't think I was prepared for this Okay There it comes Just kidding that was a fucking YouTube video Hey, what is this game here?
[00:28.07]This is called
[00:32.65]This is, uh, what is this game called?
[00:35.27]Murderous Pursuits.
[00:40.84]Murderous Pursuits is a game where you kill each other on a ship, I think.
[00:49.08]It actually says Doki Doki.
[00:52.20]I did not think it was actually going to say Doki Doki.
[00:57.07]But anyways, let me get this ready.
[00:59.95]How long is this stream going to be?
[01:01.45]Ah, blech.
[01:03.05]That's a good question.
[01:04.61]And I'll tell you a story.
[01:06.61]I'm having some pretty severe stomach issues at the moment.
[01:11.96]So life is pain right now.
[01:15.06]So I'm just throwing some things together because might as well play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[01:28.13]I'm fine.
[01:30.27]The show must go on.
[01:36.33]Anyways, I read a little bit about this.
[01:38.19]This game where you have to... It's like a spy party.
[01:41.68]The only difference is everybody is on the floor.
[01:45.00]So it's eight players, not one versus one.
[01:47.86]Somebody is the... One person is a target.
[01:50.36]And I think four or five people have to target that person.
[01:54.89]And then there's also other people that have to target those people.
[01:57.47]So it's sort of just a gigantic pretend like you're an NPC and then kill people game.
[02:01.95]I don't know.
[02:06.21]People have compared it to... Remember Assassin's Creed's multiplayer?
[02:10.73]Like that.
[02:13.75]Yes.
[02:16.30]This game could be not good, but I don't know.
[02:19.54]Let's give it a try.
[02:22.78]It's made by the people who made the ship.
[02:24.74]Okay.
[02:26.70]That's cool.
[02:29.78]This is literally the ship.
[02:37.35]gonna give it a try I'm gonna do one round where I do well you know what as my grandfather used to say get him in quick play I already read up about some of this I already read up but I think there are only like 40 people playing this game it looked interesting though
[03:11.01]Made by the same people as Doki Doki.
[03:13.03]That's not true.
[03:13.65]Alright, I guess so.
[03:14.49]Here I am.
[03:14.89]We got these people here.
[03:18.63]I don't know if there's a voice chat.
[03:19.91]Can I pick a character?
[03:20.99]Okay, I don't even know.
[03:23.01]Should I be me?
[03:31.64]Alright, I'm leaning towards Professor McGonagall or me.
[03:41.79]The Dodger won his Britannic ticket in a bet and plans to make himself a small fortune in stolen goods.
[03:46.12]As a Londoner, he much prefers life on board to jaunts through... Okay, let's do it.
[03:51.56]What about my, like, color scheme?
[03:53.18]Alright, I got... These are my abilities.
[03:57.44]Humility.
[03:57.86]Add a little extra flair by humiliating your quarry's corpse.
[04:01.50]Hide in plain sight by disguising yourself as other characters.
[04:05.32]Need a moment, you can flash.
[04:08.58]I'm gonna go with, I'm gonna go with humiliate.
[04:10.94]And then, let's see, counter.
[04:14.92]Those sound pretty good, let's go.
[04:16.66]If your dance card isn't too full tonight, shall we cut a dash?
[04:21.44]All right, so find and kill your quarry while evading one or more hunters trying to kill you.
[04:25.24]You can kill your quarry or hunters, but will be penalized if you attack other innocent passengers.
[04:31.23]So, you see the top there?
[04:32.63]That's, that's absolutely, this person right here is absolutely a fucking bad guy.
[04:37.81]Is this how you carry out an entirely polite and sane request?
[04:42.29]What?
[04:47.31]Did you see how they were moving around?
[04:48.53]Okay, well let me, that person apparently is not.
[04:52.92]See, see?
[04:55.97]What's happening here?
[04:57.35]Oh, hunted.
[05:00.01]Okay, that's a guard.
[05:01.19]See you in the top.
[05:02.63]See you signing new quarry.
[05:04.61]The game's over.
[05:06.19]But now the real question is, who was the cat and who were the mice?
[05:12.34]Ow, my stomach.
[05:13.54]Ow.
[05:13.74]Ow.
[05:22.90]what how did somebody die seven times I must have joined at the very end I don't understand this in that 10 seconds like 15 people died no no no I that was that way I got it at the very end
[05:49.42]I took too long picking my character.
[05:56.85]But there were, like, 20 deaths.
[05:59.83]I know exactly... See?
[06:01.97]There, once... You gotta aim it towards the green.
[06:04.27]Once the green is in the center, that means you're going towards your target.
[06:08.85]You can't be seen killing anybody.
[06:10.29]There are weapons everywhere.
[06:11.49]I'm not going back to Garfield Cart.
[06:15.89]We just...
[06:17.51]We just got in here.
[06:18.41]Everybody just relax.
[06:21.03]Oh, fuck.
[06:21.50]What the hell just happened?
[06:22.18]Okay, we're good.
[06:29.50]Is there a cart version of this game?
[06:34.62]Ugh.
[06:39.37]Now, you couldn't... I'm not going back to Garfield's cart.
[06:41.85]Alright, I'm gonna be ready.
[06:42.57]So, here we go.
[06:43.03]That's me.
[06:43.97]Those are fine.
[06:44.43]These are abilities...
[06:46.58]What is ability?
[06:47.10]I think it's Q and E are abilities.
[06:49.29]Change my loadout.
[06:50.05]Yeah, that's fine.
[06:50.65]Ready.
[06:52.13]No, look.
[06:52.65]Get ready.
[06:54.09]A minute and 20 seconds to get ready.
[06:56.23]Look it.
[06:57.71]No, this is the start of a new game.
[07:09.56]What are you going to do?
[07:10.20]Diddy Kong Racing.
[07:14.36]I thought to.
[07:14.74]All right, let me take a look.
[07:18.07]So when you kill your target, if I press Q, I will humiliate them.
[07:24.36]So if I get attacked, I press E, and that'll counter me being attacked.
[07:29.30]Is this like the ship?
[07:30.16]I believe so.
[07:31.00]I'm just gonna say I'm ready.
[07:37.69]I'm making everybody wait.
[07:38.61]We're fine.
[07:40.83]It's quite simple, really.
[07:43.20]Kill your quarry while evading your hunters.
[07:46.84]So while I, by the way, the dotted lines on the ground, that's how you pretend to be an NPC.
[07:52.24]So that person is absolutely not an NPC, but that's not my target.
[07:54.75]So we're going to go this way.
[07:56.57]I'm going to just gently move around.
[07:58.53]See the green bar is getting thicker.
[08:00.09]That means I'm getting close to my target.
[08:05.05]And they're on the floor below.
[08:07.11]Okay, I got to go down.
[08:11.60]Okay, but I can't be suspicious.
[08:12.98]They're right below me.
[08:14.11]Oh my god.
[08:14.55]Oh my god.
[08:15.07]Oh my god.
[08:15.51]Is that you?
[08:17.03]Who am I talking to?
[08:17.67]There's nobody even fucking here.
[08:20.47]What am I talking to?
[08:21.37]Is that you?
[08:21.87]Is this guy ready?
[08:30.91]Oh yes.
[08:32.41]At this rate, you'll definitely be the scourge of the underdeck.
[08:37.69]I've been exposed.
[08:39.35]I die all over again of embarrassment.
[08:42.75]Quarry's on the same floor.
[08:44.05]I don't want to be exposed though.
[08:45.27]I gotta hide.
[08:47.63]Where's the guard?
[08:48.43]Okay, hold on.
[08:48.83]Let me just pretend I'm a person.
[08:52.65]Here we go.
[08:54.51]Uh-oh.
[08:54.77]Something going on over there.
[09:03.89]So somebody's up here.
[09:04.91]Hunter is near.
[09:06.91]Alright, hunters are... They... If you do anything in front of a guard, you get in trouble.
[09:14.44]But there's a hun... Right through this door.
[09:16.65]This dude, right here.
[09:17.97]No.
[09:18.73]This dude!
[09:21.69]Shit!
[09:22.65]Oh, hello.
[09:24.27]There's the fighting spirit of the back streets of London.
[09:30.61]Oh my god.
[09:31.07]Is that guy coming to get me?
[09:32.17]Is that guy coming to get me?
[09:34.25]Oh dear, dear.
[09:36.49]I do hope they don't win this before you.
[09:43.42]Fuck.
[09:44.54]Okay.
[09:45.48]I like this.
[09:45.94]This is kind of fun.
[09:48.42]So hunters are not marked.
[09:50.34]Okay, I gotta go this way.
[09:54.90]Don't ever... Here's the name of the game, guys.
[09:56.40]Don't ever sprint.
[10:01.24]Same floor.
[10:02.72]Anybody that acts suspicious, I need to stop them.
[10:05.00]Suspicious.
[10:05.62]Nope.
[10:07.90]Same floor.
[10:09.18]I think the person's right across the way there.
[10:13.52]What does this do?
[10:15.38]Oh, that's a weapon.
[10:16.42]What is this weapon?
[10:19.18]Oh, shit.
[10:19.68]Whoops.
[10:20.02]What is this?
[10:22.54]Oh, I got brass knuckles?
[10:25.15]I just activated my fucking cooldown.
[10:31.93]Walk in a straight line like an NPC.
[10:37.85]I'm not doing so well.
[10:38.97]That person's like right in this... I'm going to turn right and they're going to be there.
[10:42.01]No.
[10:44.31]Let's do a little bit of research.
[10:45.39]I think they're right here.
[10:46.47]I think it's just me.
[10:48.37]It's the other me.
[10:51.53]The line's getting thinner.
[10:54.06]Lady in the red dress?
[10:55.20]Oh, wait a minute.
[10:59.42]That guy right there?
[11:00.87]Oh my god!
[11:01.41]Oh my god!
[11:08.05]Don't... I don't know who the hunter is.
[11:10.97]It was the lady in the red dress, for sure.
[11:15.82]I'm certain.
[11:20.56]Just don't ever run.
[11:24.64]Only when you're in a hallway like that, hunter is near.
[11:26.98]Oh fuck.
[11:27.52]Where?
[11:29.24]What the hell?
[11:34.01]What?
[11:34.93]Are you serious?
[11:40.17]That guy was just pretending to be... What a dick.
[11:44.57]Unbelievable.
[11:47.61]I just got punched right in the face.
[11:50.36]I want to be a hunter, man.
[11:51.26]That sounds like much more fun.
[11:56.45]No, wait, we're all hunters, aren't we?
[11:57.98]We all have like a certain target.
[12:02.14]I see something going on.
[12:03.76]Yeah, it was the lady in the red dress.
[12:05.82]God damn it.
[12:07.16]What the fuck was that?
[12:10.92]There's a lot of noise over here.
[12:19.64]These people are freaking me out.
[12:20.66]Right?
[12:21.62]Alright, let's just take a look.
[12:23.88]Okay, quarry nearby.
[12:24.63]Who is it?
[12:25.05]That guy, right there.
[12:27.53]stop larking around with that god when I get arrested time is murder do get on with it why am I under arrest I see your quarry has most oh you're gonna embarrass me huh you do know I'm standing here right what are you playing at huh
[12:54.66]That was the same fucking person.
[12:57.74]That was the same lady.
[13:00.81]Give me a break.
[13:03.09]It was the same fucking lady.
[13:16.74]Alright.
[13:17.48]I did alright at first.
[13:21.24]This is funny.
[13:21.82]Alright, what about the weapons?
[13:23.90]There's a sword here.
[13:27.02]Got the sword.
[13:27.78]Quarry is the floor above.
[13:32.30]I'm starting to put it together and understand.
[13:36.14]Once you get stunned by a quarry, you get a new one.
[13:38.62]Okay, I see.
[13:40.30]I guess that makes some sense.
[13:42.66]How fucking... I'm so obvious right now.
[13:46.59]I couldn't be more obvious.
[13:52.23]Same floor.
[13:52.86]I'm gonna... Okay, I think she's using this room here.
[13:56.32]Fuck, somebody got her already.
[13:59.62]You mean the quarry?
[14:01.20]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah.
[14:02.64]Oh, you're moving around real fast.
[14:07.43]There's that guy.
[14:07.93]Hunter's near.
[14:11.13]Oh, shit.
[14:16.69]I swear this ship suffers an embarrassment of murder enthusiasts oh I knew it too oh my stomach how am I doing oh last place gotta make that gotta make it deep to watch guard
[14:43.49]Alright, this is my first game.
[14:44.63]Come on.
[14:45.01]This is the first game jumping into quick play.
[14:48.81]I'm understanding it now.
[14:51.59]They're in this room to the left.
[14:56.55]They're going further and further away.
[15:01.23]That person, I don't know what that person was doing, but they just freaked me out.
[15:03.28]They're down below.
[15:05.34]Fuck, I'm being so obvious.
[15:06.88]One floor below.
[15:07.76]They're moving around this way.
[15:10.80]I'm gonna try to catch them around this side.
[15:19.14]Where the fuck are you going?
[15:27.14]Don't do it.
[15:28.70]Same floor.
[15:29.96]There they are.
[15:36.95]That might be a hunter.
[15:37.89]No, it would tell me if they're nearby.
[15:39.47]Oh, you're in so much trouble.
[15:41.81]You got Luigi'd, is what happened here.
[15:47.82]Now, you're about to get Luigi'd.
[15:49.16]No!
[15:56.27]God damn it!
[16:02.15]No, you can't run!
[16:02.69]That's why she knew!
[16:03.31]Everyone told me to run!
[16:20.88]run.
[16:21.46]See what happens when I run?
[16:22.64]I get exposed.
[16:31.45]Let's stay in here for a minute.
[16:32.95]Okay.
[16:34.65]Okay.
[16:35.13]That's obviously... Well, you got a kill.
[16:41.76]Don't you fucking dare.
[16:52.41]Alright, it's that guy.
[16:53.59]It's the guy right here.
[16:59.18]Watch this.
[17:03.36]See you later.
[17:06.04]That's such bullshit.
[17:08.87]That sucks so much.
[17:11.03]That's what the guy did to me last time.
[17:12.37]He just waited for me.
[17:15.53]Quarry, same floor.
[17:16.83]Hunter is near.
[17:17.62]Okay.
[17:23.18]Who's the hunter?
[17:23.74]He went back up there.
[17:29.19]It might be that lady.
[17:30.07]What am I doing?
[17:33.33]I think that lady right here is a hunter.
[17:38.74]Kill guards?
[17:40.78]I think you can knock out guards.
[17:45.38]I won!
[17:57.61]Didn't come in last place.
[17:58.59]So, I mean, guys, you know everyone, the joke is last place, but this is my first game ever.
[18:07.30]This is kind of fun.
[18:15.44]Not last place.
[18:16.08]Yeah, it was three and four.
[18:21.46]Going up the ladder.
[18:23.72]I have to win at least one time.
[18:26.37]I don't know about that, man.
[18:27.21]There are people that probably... Second game ever.
[18:31.35]What do you mean second game ever?
[18:34.79]You played that ten second game?
[18:36.21]That's not fair.
[18:36.93]That's not a fair assessment.
[18:43.57]Didn't get dead last, yeah.
[18:47.27]We have to move up to where Yoshi would be.
[18:49.61]Like four, five, or six every time in Mario Kart.
[18:56.36]First place, so go back to Garfield Cart.
[18:59.87]Is there a difference between any of these people?
[19:01.63]I don't know if there's a difference.
[19:04.75]I think it's just who you look like.
[19:07.25]Let's be this guy.
[19:07.95]Who's the most absolutely stealthy?
[19:10.65]Who's the most inconspicuous?
[19:11.75]I'm going to be McGonagall.
[19:15.95]It's fine.
[19:17.09]Let me see these moves.
[19:18.40]You need a moment.
[19:19.00]Flash everyone around you, blinding and stunning them.
[19:24.04]Humiliate is hard to use.
[19:28.62]I'm taking this.
[19:30.04]And I'm gonna do a flash as well.
[19:36.02]Why are we measuring things with Mario Kart?
[19:37.56]Because we just played Garfield Kart.
[19:39.02]Okay.
[19:39.12]Let's try this again.
[19:40.46]One floor above.
[19:41.40]We are... Maggie McGonagall.
[19:42.18]Make sure I'm not being followed.
[19:44.73]Same floor.
[19:59.29]Right in here.
[20:01.01]There they are.
[20:03.11]I know where you are.
[20:07.80]Oh, come on.
[20:08.32]What the fuck was that?
[20:10.04]That's not even her.
[20:12.24]That's her.
[20:12.58]Right here.
[20:15.48]Fuck!
[20:17.20]It was her!
[20:20.11]Well, cheer up.
[20:21.77]You did come second in that encounter.
[20:24.69]So it's not all bad.
[20:29.93]You saw her sprint into this room.
[20:31.77]Now who is it?
[20:39.02]Right into my graph.
[20:40.18]Right into my graph.
[20:41.92]Skilled.
[20:43.20]Highly skilled.
[20:44.24]Signing a new quarry.
[20:56.34]Get out of my way.
[20:58.10]No, okay, I just freaked the fuck out.
[21:02.22]No, what?
[21:02.90]Why?
[21:04.61]Okay, that was... That was a domino right there.
[21:12.67]Interesting.
[21:14.53]So that was... I was that target and she was her target.
[21:17.47]Interesting.
[21:22.66]Where is this guy?
[21:24.28]Are you a hunter?
[21:25.85]Right there.
[21:29.31]Right above me.
[21:35.46]Actually, right above me.
[21:41.84]Don't think so, dickhead.
[21:42.70]Yeah, that was a hunter.
[21:48.95]You see that sprint he was doing?
[21:50.13]He did a Jeremy.
[21:50.97]He like ran straight at me and was like moving around like twitching all over the place.
[21:58.74]I'm gonna get an item.
[22:04.18]One floor above.
[22:07.94]Hunter is near.
[22:08.78]Okay.
[22:11.10]Who?
[22:12.86]Whose brains am I gonna bash in?
[22:17.03]Nope.
[22:17.29]Okay.
[22:18.87]Don't you dare.
[22:20.39]I think it was... No.
[22:22.55]One floor above.
[22:23.87]Alright, we gotta be an NPC here.
[22:25.09]Ready?
[22:25.25]Ready?
[22:40.16]All right, now hide.
[22:44.10]Hide.
[22:45.98]Kill exposed.
[22:46.94]Yeah, well, you're going to fall.
[22:49.24]Do I have another one right here?
[22:52.78]It's already telling me.
[22:57.50]Why is it already telling me this?
[22:59.29]They're exposed.
[23:00.59]That's why.
[23:00.91]Okay, well, I didn't even catch who it was.
[23:04.65]Don't run.
[23:06.91]Fuck, I don't know who it was.
[23:08.91]On the right?
[23:09.31]Oh!
[23:09.89]Oh, dear.
[23:11.77]That one's a rather fancy proposition, I'd say.
[23:18.45]What?
[23:19.11]How would you do this?
[23:20.84]Immediately.
[23:21.30]What are you, a hacker?
[23:27.32]I never liked them.
[23:28.84]You've done me the most splendid of services.
[23:37.00]Uh, favorite table.
[23:38.47]What did I get?
[23:41.15]Favorite table.
[23:41.91]Oh, I'm in fucking third place, guys.
[23:47.43]Floor above.
[23:48.07]Hunter is near.
[23:50.39]In this room, maybe?
[23:51.06]I was trying to flashbang.
[23:58.12]Damn it.
[23:58.30]That was close.
[24:09.42]Time to plummet to last place.
[24:12.76]Maybe.
[24:14.06]One floor above.
[24:18.06]Right above me.
[24:18.58]Okay.
[24:19.32]Going down this way.
[24:27.12]Floor above still.
[24:29.44]I'm freaking out right now.
[24:30.62]I hate this.
[24:32.52]I love this, but I also hate this.
[24:34.20]It's scary.
[24:36.53]One floor above.
[24:37.57]I need a staircase.
[24:38.35]There we go.
[24:43.55]GG.
[24:44.21]Alright, here we go.
[24:44.77]I'm going to use my ability here.
[24:48.58]Same floor.
[24:52.24]Somebody gave a lot of money.
[24:55.36]Let me wait until this round is over.
[24:57.61]I'm a top fucking three streamer right now.
[24:59.69]Hunter is near.
[25:04.01]Fuck out of here.
[25:13.02]Excuse me.
[25:14.50]Oh.
[25:16.24]That was... He kind of walked right into that knife.
[25:22.65]Hunter is near again.
[25:30.33]Same floor.
[25:30.89]Quarry.
[25:35.20]In this next room.
[25:36.86]Oh, come in here.
[25:37.84]First person that comes in this room.
[25:39.02]Hunter is... It's this one.
[25:40.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:43.51]Where's the quarry?
[25:46.85]Oh, shit!
[25:52.15]They were right there, unfortunately.
[25:55.45]I still have somebody on my tailbone.
[26:00.60]In the same room.
[26:03.80]It's so paranoid to play this game.
[26:06.73]Hunter is near.
[26:07.34]I think that's the hunter.
[26:09.84]I would be shocked if it wasn't.
[26:11.06]Yes, it is.
[26:11.74]That's definitely my hunter.
[26:14.24]It's not?
[26:16.04]Give me the gun.
[26:20.64]The lady right here.
[26:21.18]Found ya.
[26:27.37]Ooh, I'm close.
[26:28.09]I'm close, guys.
[26:36.91]Same floor.
[26:38.44]Give me the brass knuckles.
[26:40.92]Hunter is near.
[26:41.76]Oh, excuse me.
[26:43.10]Wait, how did I not... Countered.
[26:49.69]Countered.
[26:50.79]Okay.
[26:51.61]Because I stopped her, but... Countered.
[26:57.07]That guy has a lot more favor than I do.
[27:01.47]Yeah, he has the counter ability.
[27:03.15]He just assumed I was going to do it.
[27:05.61]Hold F to view the favorite items.
[27:06.79]So that's how you get more points, is by using these other items.
[27:10.21]Maybe by having this item equipped, I'm slower or something?
[27:12.53]What?
[27:12.95]Too many fucking people.
[27:16.91]Yeah, you're under arrest.
[27:28.29]Uh, there was a lot of random people in this room.
[27:30.83]You know what?
[27:31.13]Fuck it.
[27:33.67]Told you.
[27:34.41]I knew it.
[27:34.85]I could feel it.
[27:35.31]Get out of here.
[27:37.97]Can we please get out of this fucking room?
[27:40.11]Give me a break.
[27:42.25]It must have... It must be slower.
[28:00.03]What are you doing in here?
[28:04.67]I thought there was a hunter in here.
[28:12.28]Hunter across the way.
[28:15.60]Don't just stand still like an idiot.
[28:19.42]Hunter is coming in.
[28:21.60]Right there, I think.
[28:24.45]No.
[28:25.65]She's going to come in the same room.
[28:27.51]Hunter?
[28:27.65]Hunter?
[28:29.44]Really?
[28:31.93]What the fuck?
[28:34.07]Wow.
[28:36.57]I just got played so hard.
[28:44.78]The guy was there the whole time.
[28:49.44]He was listening to the conversation we were having.
[28:52.34]I'm alright with third place.
[28:56.35]Same floor.
[28:57.09]Hunter is near as well.
[29:00.01]Oh, come on.
[29:05.64]God damn it.
[29:06.42]Now we're down in fourth place.
[29:07.50]I gotta sprint and kill somebody.
[29:12.82]Somebody has to get sprint murdered.
[29:14.02]20 seconds.
[29:17.08]Same floor.
[29:19.91]I'm gonna say it's right there.
[29:22.37]Right there.
[29:23.15]Right there.
[29:24.31]Excuse me.
[29:28.36]What just happened here?
[29:29.92]I'm not sure.
[29:30.36]Anybody in here, Hunter?
[29:31.82]One-two punch.
[29:35.60]Got double a punch.
[29:36.02]This person keeps winning.
[29:56.66]Hey, that's top three, man.
[29:59.20]That's not great, but it's alright.
[30:04.36]It's a bronze medal.
[30:08.55]So I have to assume that when you level up, you can buy skins and new items and everything?
[30:20.63]Top three.
[30:23.51]Mm-hmm.
[30:26.59]I want to find some high-scoring weapons this time.
[30:36.85]You get better ping when you level up.
[30:43.06]Oh, right.
[30:43.40]Bets, bets, bets.
[30:44.00]Yeah, somebody gave me a lot of money.
[30:46.96]So... Thank you, Stormy Chu.
[30:49.78]Stormy Chu gave $50 a few minutes ago.
[30:52.86]Thank you, Stormy.
[30:55.18]And they say, this is going to be cheesy as hell, but I wanted to let you know that you're legitimately one of the best streamers on Twitch, and I've loved your content for years.
[31:03.80]I wish you and everyone in chat a good night.
[31:06.38]Thank you, Stormy.
[31:08.88]That means a hell of a lot.
[31:13.37]Not cheesy.
[31:16.63]Thank you for the $50.
[31:21.77]You have a great night as well.
[31:24.89]Um... Let's be... Let's be Bearded Guy.
[31:30.88]Bearded Guy... I like these.
[31:33.46]Reveal is great.
[31:36.26]Contra seems really great, too.
[31:37.62]I'll try one of the other ones.
[31:41.08]Humiliate is extra points, but it fucks with you.
[31:44.82]Um... God damn it, it's me!
[31:49.93]You can change your disguise.
[31:55.23]I wonder how that works.
[32:00.20]Yep, get out of here.
[32:08.90]Right off the bat, that person was going in for a quick kill.
[32:12.06]Oh boy.
[32:14.77]So wait, I can just do that on the fly?
[32:16.41]How many times can I do this?
[32:19.21]How long does it last?
[32:20.85]Ugh.
[32:27.71]Right above here?
[32:28.29]Is there going to be a turn down the stairs?
[32:31.52]I'm going to be waiting for him.
[32:36.20]No.
[32:36.80]Oh, I really thought they were going to come right down the stairs.
[32:42.22]Okay, so that lasts about two minutes?
[32:44.58]A minute?
[32:47.35]Same floor.
[32:52.47]Same floor.
[32:54.19]Might wrap around behind me right here.
[32:55.63]There he is.
[32:57.80]Be patient, patience, the tortoise wins the race.
[33:08.34]Tortoise!
[33:09.14]I don't understand what the fuck just happened.
[33:11.16]Do you like that?
[33:13.80]Do you like that?
[33:14.32]Do you like how I like ran, walked away and then fucking sprinted at him and he freaked out and he clicked on the wrong person?
[33:21.31]You don't think that was calculated and intentional?
[33:28.83]Shit.
[33:30.63]And now I'm getting danced on.
[33:34.75]Yeah, I walked a little bit like a World of Warcraft NPC, and then I ripped backwards and sprinted, and at that point, that guy is having a meltdown.
[33:47.22]I'll keep the gun.
[33:47.70]I hope everybody saw that.
[33:52.38]Alright, one floor above.
[33:59.78]Got a hunter nearby too.
[34:01.14]I might just... Give me the one that's five favor.
[34:11.78]Let's get the bonus up a little bit.
[34:14.76]Who are you?
[34:17.38]No, you're fine.
[34:19.24]Yeah, so the longer you stay inside of one of these circles, the more bonus you get.
[34:25.92]One floor above.
[34:26.98]I gotta make my way up there quick.
[34:34.68]Easy, easy.
[34:37.96]If this is a hunter next to me, I swear to God.
[34:41.96]No.
[34:43.13]I'm going to say... This guy looks like... No, I could have sworn.
[34:48.77]You know what I mean?
[34:52.47]That guy was coming at me with... I'll be waiting for him.
[35:00.09]Lady?
[35:00.69]It's going to be this lady.
[35:02.33]Which one?
[35:10.07]Don't pay no attention to the person that just turned into a different person.
[35:13.55]Same floor.
[35:14.87]Alright.
[35:15.45]Okay.
[35:16.41]I think it's... It's one of these people standing over here drinking.
[35:21.85]And a hunter is nearby, too.
[35:23.01]I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna figure this out.
[35:27.52]Who is it?
[35:28.80]Which one?
[35:30.82]No, they went down.
[35:31.58]Wasn't any of them.
[35:34.22]Get away from me.
[35:34.86]Get away from me.
[35:35.32]Don't... Don't tap... Right here.
[35:37.58]This lady.
[35:38.22]Excuse me!
[35:49.83]All that deduction for nothing.
[35:56.11]Got countered with that stupid move.
[36:02.85]Same floor.
[36:03.81]God, I haven't been able to do anything.
[36:06.58]Are we gonna come through this door over here on the right?
[36:13.60]I have 10 points here if I get a kill.
[36:17.81]In this room.
[36:19.07]In this circle, actually.
[36:20.73]Let's try to get it.
[36:22.65]Who is it?
[36:24.49]What?
[36:27.13]Does everybody have counter?
[36:28.25]What the fuck?
[36:32.07]Everybody have that fucking move?
[36:33.57]Or what?
[36:35.13]If a person is waiting, it means they've got a counter.
[36:39.60]Yeah, where's this hunter?
[36:44.34]This guy right here.
[36:45.18]I don't know.
[36:46.62]I don't know who it is.
[36:48.16]There's two nearby.
[36:49.88]I don't know who the fuck it is.
[36:55.30]I don't know.
[36:55.76]They might be standing in this circle.
[37:05.42]Everybody has a fucking counter.
[37:08.14]What the fuck?
[37:12.42]That's stupid.
[37:13.66]Come on, man.
[37:14.30]That's three counters in a row.
[37:15.84]They could be in this very room.
[37:22.46]I'm just going to get counter and just... Before I go fight somebody, just activate the damn thing.
[37:29.29]I can't... I haven't... I've only died twice.
[37:30.87]I haven't had two interactions.
[37:35.89]It's above.
[37:37.07]What was that?
[37:37.47]I have to join the meadow.
[37:41.38]Well, I didn't even know what the meta was until 30 seconds ago.
[37:49.04]I hear footsteps.
[37:55.14]They are right above.
[37:58.66]You gotta counter the counter to get a counter.
[38:01.80]I'm gonna show up on the map here for somebody very soon.
[38:04.71]Let's build it back up to five.
[38:09.54]I'm not going to come in first place anymore.
[38:11.34]Ah shit.
[38:19.46]Come on, you guys would have done the same thing.
[38:26.32]Oh fuck.
[38:27.17]Hide.
[38:28.51]Oh fuck.
[38:29.25]Oh my god.
[38:29.95]Oh my god.
[38:32.35]You would have done the same thing.
[38:35.13]You would have done the same thing.
[38:39.09]That person was bee-lining for my body.
[38:43.29]That's a hunter right there.
[38:44.30]I know it.
[38:46.38]Wow, that's unbelievable.
[38:47.84]How?
[38:50.06]Are we planning a long stay in the Marshall Sea?
[38:53.86]I'm so paranoid now.
[38:59.22]You would have done the same thing.
[39:00.32]If there is to succeed, another must fail.
[39:06.46]Quite poetic.
[39:08.93]I was right in front of a cop, man.
[39:10.53]I'm a different person.
[39:23.62]As you have yet to learn, that is not how one... I'm so paranoid right now.
[39:28.28]Because that person followed me.
[39:31.96]Where is this quarry?
[39:34.08]What are you doing?
[39:36.79]Is this lady over there?
[39:40.53]Where?
[39:40.77]It's you.
[39:41.50]It's you.
[39:42.04]Okay.
[39:45.00]Thank you for the points.
[39:46.68]Thank you.
[39:47.12]I would... Thank you.
[39:48.24]Appreciate it.
[40:05.50]Get out of here.
[40:08.57]Behind me?
[40:08.77]Oh, that was the... Oh, come on.
[40:10.15]That's horseshit.
[40:11.87]I just got doubled.
[40:13.29]Okay, I need something better.
[40:24.72]I got flashed and then punched.
[40:27.70]Same floor.
[40:28.25]Oh, okay.
[40:28.71]No, that's fine.
[40:36.62]I think they're currently walking the same route.
[40:38.04]I want to get to five.
[40:41.84]Same hunters nearby.
[40:42.84]Get out of here.
[40:50.08]Where are they?
[40:50.50]Right there.
[40:50.88]That person... Oh, I wonder if it's the person running around.
[40:52.95]Is it this lady?
[40:58.55]What?
[40:59.33]No, it's the lady right across.
[41:00.53]Right across.
[41:00.91]Right across.
[41:04.62]Wait, who is it?
[41:05.50]Is it the lady or is it the guy right there?
[41:08.34]No, it was the lady.
[41:08.92]It's the lady down here.
[41:09.56]I'm just going to follow her.
[41:10.46]They're hiding in the bathroom?
[41:29.16]She ran.
[41:29.62]I don't want to run after her.
[41:30.80]I need to build this up.
[41:37.51]Okay, they're currently running.
[41:39.13]The first person is running around up there.
[41:45.89]Oops.
[41:54.20]It's game over, I'm afraid.
[41:56.12]More for some than others.
[41:59.44]I got to put counter on because counter seems like... That was like three or four kills I could have had.
[42:14.64]I mean, we all came in pretty much fourth place here.
[42:18.13]Fifth place was like three or four people.
[42:19.73]Yeah, I'm getting rid of the change disguise.
[42:24.90]I don't want to want that.
[42:37.42]Twitch user?
[42:38.66]Oh, there's a Twitch user.
[42:44.20]It's the ship, but Assassin's Creed.
[42:45.56]I mean, this actually is pretty fun.
[42:48.96]I mean, it's very limited.
[42:52.38]This is pretty much it.
[42:59.69]Flashbang fan the hammer.
[43:08.67]Yeah.
[43:09.67]For what it is, this is actually pretty fun.
[43:12.23]How much was this game?
[43:14.19]I don't know.
[43:15.27]I don't remember.
[43:15.82]I didn't see.
[43:18.00]Alright, let's do... We're going to do one more in this lobby, then I'm going to rejoin.
[43:23.30]Let's be... Let's be the prince.
[43:29.74]Alright, let's do I really like reveal but I also want counter We're not done one yet disguise.
[43:36.06]I don't disguise is alright, but I Don't I don't think I mean I could be wrong here But disguise doesn't if somebody can already have me on their mini-map and follow me around and see what room I'm in What does disguise even supposed to do?
[43:51.09]We'll do counter and reveal
[44:05.77]This game doesn't have the monopoly guy.
[44:07.39]This guy doesn't do anything.
[44:09.08]Yeah, it just feels like it shouldn't even... I don't know.
[44:16.60]How long am I going to play this for?
[44:18.86]I'm not sure until I'm just kind of done with it.
[44:21.57]Might be in a round.
[44:22.35]It might be in like three rounds.
[44:23.63]I don't know.
[44:28.95]Looking at the wrong camera.
[44:31.17]Yeah, he's looking at camera two over there.
[44:38.86]Okay, let's try this.
[44:43.55]Hunter is already in the room here.
[44:46.89]What if they're right next to me?
[44:47.81]No, I think it's the person who just went upstairs.
[44:49.01]Okay, let's just move.
[44:56.90]One floor above.
[44:57.62]They're going to show themselves right over there.
[45:05.14]No, they're going further to the left.

[45:43.83]It was our first request for somebody to convince their chat that they're tall, so we hope this works.
[45:48.13]Thanks again for using our fake donation service once again.
[45:50.56]P.S., obviously don't read this part.
[45:52.48]Make sure you hide the donation message.
[45:54.48]Hey, thanks, man.
[45:55.32]Thank you.
[45:56.06]Thanks, Todd.
[45:57.54]Thanks, man.
[46:04.13]Hey, a hunter!
[46:07.29]As you can see, this hunter really is one to watch.
[46:12.23]I was about to hit the button.
[46:14.31]But thank you so much, dude.
[46:15.61]That's a $100 joke that you made on my expense.
[46:21.05]But it was actually at your expense, too, because you expensed it.
[46:25.32]Thank you so much, man.
[46:30.35]Okay, one floor above.
[46:36.23]Let's get back on the leaderboard here.
[46:37.57]Okay, don't run in front of this guy.
[46:42.50]Am I gonna run into him upstairs?
[46:48.48]Sometimes you gotta run.
[46:49.96]Oh, shit.
[46:50.46]There they are.
[46:53.60]Okay.
[46:59.23]I wonder if that guy knows.
[47:03.41]I wonder if this guy knows who I am.
[47:05.19]There's the hunter.
[47:10.69]Get out of my face!
[47:14.04]Bless my cockles.
[47:16.20]Where did you learn to do that?
[47:18.28]Oh, shit.
[47:18.72]Oh, shit.
[47:19.08]Oh, shit.
[47:19.42]I'm in trouble.
[47:19.96]He's going to kill me.
[47:26.26]Same floor.
[47:32.97]Countered.
[47:33.97]Mm-hmm.
[47:36.82]So, yeah, that move is fucking fantastic.
[47:38.80]Alright, let's hide here for a second.
[47:42.88]Excuse me!
[47:43.28]Oh, goddammit, I just freaked out.
[47:46.37]I thought the guy was putting the gun on my head.
[47:47.57]What is this guy doing?
[47:51.17]This guy's freaking me out right now.
[47:57.10]Really?
[48:01.52]Where are you?
[48:02.46]Who is it?
[48:03.16]Oh, come on.
[48:04.00]There's too many people up here.
[48:06.86]There's too much fucking happening.
[48:09.65]What the fuck is going on right now?
[48:12.01]There's too much happening.
[48:13.35]Too many people are in the same spot.
[48:21.65]Where's this hunter?
[48:24.79]Oh, in second place.
[48:28.01]Dude, this guy has 52... This guy's killed five fucking people.
[48:32.79]What the hell?
[48:35.45]Oh, okay.
[48:35.77]That was funny.
[48:37.49]New guard.
[48:37.97]He's gonna be doing okay, considering.
[48:44.02]Okay, I got my... I do have hunters near him.
[48:55.48]No, okay, I figured it might've been somebody right there.
[48:58.56]That was costly.
[48:59.44]It's all right, I got counters still.
[49:08.32]Knew it.
[49:09.76]I'd suggest an eel pie to celebrate.
[49:12.36]They're in this room.
[49:14.14]Where are they?
[49:14.68]Right here.
[49:16.14]Oh, give me a break.
[49:17.52]It's the lady.
[49:18.18]Hardly in the spirit of the British Empire.
[49:21.24]What hateful behavior.
[49:23.58]You're better off away from it.
[49:24.96]You really are.
[49:27.90]This is just like... There's always too many people.
[49:31.10]There's a hunter in here.
[49:36.57]What do you think you're doing over here, man?
[49:38.29]There's my target.
[49:43.42]Okay.
[49:49.97]I'm just gonna stay in this room.
[49:51.67]You know?
[49:52.23]Like, that's what I'm... I'm just gonna stand here.
[49:54.81]Because, uh... This is... What the fuck?
[50:00.59]That was not fair.
[50:03.77]He just... I... That was... He knows that was bullshit.
[50:08.08]We... He got me as a quarry standing next to me.
[50:13.34]That's not fair.
[50:19.75]And he got extra points for that.
[50:26.29]I still have five.
[50:27.21]I'm a hunter around here now.
[50:28.41]Where?
[50:31.63]Is he behind me?
[50:34.61]Okay.
[50:35.32]Floor below.
[50:37.66]I still have five points if I get somebody here, which would take me up to, like, fourth or third place.
[50:43.90]There, okay, here they come.
[50:44.88]I think that might be a hunter.
[50:49.11]Yep.
[50:50.51]I'm prepared here.
[50:51.19]I think we've got a hunter coming up here around the side.
[50:56.19]I might just walk by and counter.
[51:00.21]Okay.
[51:03.93]I don't... I think that was the right play.
[51:06.03]I do.
[51:13.13]Where?
[51:13.29]Oh!
[51:13.35]Fuck.
[51:13.45]Blow all cooldowns.
[51:14.03]Can I screw somebody now?
[51:18.81]Can I like spawn next to someone?
[51:51.18]Same floor, they're across the hall.
[51:58.21]I'm gonna say I think it's the guy with the cap over here that just stopped.
[52:01.27]No, did he leave the room?
[52:07.78]No, he's too far away now.
[52:10.36]Floor below.
[52:15.26]That guy looked like he was gonna fuck around.
[52:20.31]Oh god, is this a hunter?
[52:22.09]Oh god, are you a hunter?
[52:23.11]I don't know.
[52:23.55]I'm afraid to blow this cooldown.
[52:25.27]No, here's this lady.
[52:26.98]This is my target right here.
[52:27.90]Fucking countered.
[52:31.30]Give me a break.
[53:00.71]Anybody around?
[53:01.29]No.
[53:01.35]Who cares?
[53:19.62]Now I'm just panicking.
[53:27.40]Every time I get a quarry, I'm either spawning across the whole map from them, or they're running in the complete opposite direction that I'm going.
[53:38.34]It's one of those people over there.
[53:42.23]Straight ahead, okay.
[53:46.14]No, it wasn't you, really.
[53:50.40]It's the lady down there.
[53:52.56]Right?
[53:52.74]The fuck is it?
[53:59.51]God damn it.
[54:01.53]It's the guy across.
[54:02.43]It's me.
[54:03.41]It's the mirror.
[54:04.13]It's me.
[54:04.65]It's just me.
[54:05.41]It's the mirror me.
[54:09.17]It's mirror me.
[54:15.12]Get out of here.
[54:15.60]Hold on.
[54:15.88]Wait.
[54:16.00]Okay, wait, hold on.
[54:16.44]That was my hunter, and then... Again.
[54:18.04]Again, I'm down here.
[54:18.76]I don't even have a quarry.
[54:21.66]I do hope you killed with some politeness and decorum.
[54:46.78]I think those guys are working together.
[54:55.12]I mean, how could they?
[55:03.03]Wait, are people working together?
[55:04.55]I'm not even paying attention to the game chat.
[55:10.63]Alright, let's go to the main menu.
[55:16.49]Level 3, that's right.
[55:17.41]Alright, let's do it again.
[55:26.13]If somebody is like ghosting, I can't avoid it.
[55:28.59]There's like 30 people playing this game.
[55:32.94]You know how hard it is to not get stream sniped when like 30 people are queuing up for the same game?
[55:37.30]It's like a 40% chance you're gonna get in this game.
[55:43.42]That's 8 out of 30.
[55:50.66]Uh, I'll stick with this.
[55:54.21]What's going on?
[55:57.57]Something happening here?
[56:01.61]Do a 10 minute stream delay.
[56:06.49]Garfield cart doesn't have stream.
[56:09.28]I don't think anybody's stream sniping.
[56:10.78]I don't.
[56:11.12]I mean, I haven't really seen that much evidence that it's happening.
[56:17.27]I mean, maybe it is, but there's no way I can avoid that unless I do, like, a stream delay.
[56:21.49]But I'm not gonna do a stream delay.
[56:24.43]You don't wanna turn on, like, a three-minute stream delay?
[56:27.14]I don't even think I can do that at this point.
[56:37.62]Hey, I'm still playing it, though.
[56:38.64]Like, I still am enjoying it.
[56:41.95]Someone literally is called Presto Majesto.
[56:44.57]Oh.
[56:54.78]Oh, my stomach is eating me alive, but it's funny.
[57:01.10]One minute delay.
[57:02.62]I don't even know if I can do that being live.
[57:06.50]I think I have to set that before I start streaming.
[57:09.97]It's all right.
[57:10.47]Come at me.
[57:15.04]I really don't think it's going to be that big of a deal.
[57:25.46]Tell us about the Boston accent.
[57:28.04]What do you mean?
[57:31.03]Thanks for the game, Jerma, and sorry about the circling.
[57:33.21]Your chat made me do it.
[57:34.55]Wait, so somebody was in that game.
[57:43.92]What do you mean, chat made me do it?
[57:45.70]Yeah, I have to restart the stream for a delay.
[57:59.88]Do I have anything necessarily planned for the rest of the night?
[58:02.76]No, I mean, there are a couple of options, but... I'm having, like, a lot of problems right now with my stomach.
[58:08.56]So... We'll see how I feel in the next, like, 40 minutes or so, hour.
[58:15.68]Don't take this the wrong way, but you seem very silly.
[58:20.18]That's not... That's alright.
[58:22.96]I think... I'm stuck here, I think.
[58:27.69]Never... Oh, no.
[58:28.57]Okay, that's... I'm ready.
[58:37.05]Yeah, my stomach is in a knot right now.
[58:41.59]So, I am just drinking water and, uh, and coping.
[58:49.71]Well, we got a lot of fun stuff going on this weekend, so.
[58:55.91]Owie, my stomach.
[58:56.91]What are you, five?
[58:57.91]Grow a pair.
[58:58.61]Oh my god.
[58:59.51]Jesus.
[59:09.09]Oh my god.
[59:12.77]Damn.
[59:16.39]Tell me how you really feel.
[59:18.38]Hunter!
[59:21.22]It's not that guy?
[59:23.66]It has to be that guy.
[59:25.34]And I just blew the cool down like a fucking idiot.
[59:31.86]Where?
[59:32.88]Oh.
[59:34.48]Floor below.
[59:35.08]I'm going to try to actually win this one.
[59:37.42]Let's go for it.
[59:38.36]I've got to get downstairs.
[59:42.80]Now you guys have me paranoid for like stream snipers.
[60:04.57]I gotta go all the way around.
[60:05.67]We're gonna go this way, actually.
[60:06.65]No, I'm not in first place.
[60:11.67]Floor below.
[60:16.22]I'm gonna run right into them, I think, if I turn this corner.
[60:20.30]Hunter nearby.
[60:21.04]No, I really thought you would've come upstairs by now.
[60:26.00]We gotta hide.
[60:26.42]Goddamn.
[60:32.38]Is this like the ship?
[60:33.50]It is like a combination of... Isn't the ship like you talk?
[60:37.16]Like text to speech and shit.
[60:39.22]This is more the Assassin's Creed multiplayer.
[60:42.38]From, what, Brotherhood, right?
[60:43.68]I need to get down the stairs.
[60:55.04]This person is at one of the dinner tables.
[60:58.34]Let's get a good look.
[61:02.93]It's the lady right here.
[61:08.84]Where's my hunter?
[61:12.12]Where's my hunter?
[61:13.64]Where's my hunter?
[61:18.72]Hunter right behind me.
[61:24.39]Yep.
[61:24.81]Sayonara.
[61:26.85]We got... We need brass knuckles or we need a different weapon?
[61:30.39]Gotta go to the floor above?
[61:34.67]Hunters near Nope right here God damn it.
[61:41.72]I wasn't gonna do it in time You heard those clicks you heard those clicks first place Damn it.
[61:50.50]I really tried to die.
[61:51.62]I was going like I was going tickety tickety tickety tickety, you know, I was going tickety and it didn't matter And ping what's my ping Well, they did manage to get in first
[62:04.41]102 ping.
[62:04.93]That guy had zero.
[62:05.79]This guy's got zero ping.
[62:10.56]Oh, I just need a new quarry.
[62:11.48]There we go.
[62:11.88]I don't know what the hell they did, but... I think it's this lady who's the hunter.
[62:19.03]Yeah, I'm gonna take a gamble here.
[62:21.64]I know it.
[62:22.12]Yeah.
[62:22.60]Sometimes your intuition pays off.
[62:25.70]Another hunter.
[62:27.38]I just passed him.
[62:29.20]I'm going to activate... Oh, what?
[62:33.95]I want that weapon.
[62:38.59]Hunter is near.
[62:39.11]Is this guy right here?
[62:44.45]I have that disguise on.
[62:45.83]That's fine.
[62:47.37]Same floor.
[62:48.31]Coming in this room right now.
[62:49.73]I've got to hide.
[62:53.19]Same floor.
[62:54.07]There they are.
[62:54.88]It's the woman right there.
[62:55.90]Let's steal her spot.
[63:04.52]No.
[63:04.60]Same floor.
[63:04.92]Coming in this room again, I'm going to assume.
[63:07.30]Right there.
[63:23.80]Oh, shit.
[63:24.52]Man, thanks for the stun.
[63:28.62]Appreciate it.
[63:30.28]That person was a player the whole time.
[63:34.10]Hunter is near.
[63:34.72]It's this guy right here.
[63:37.25]Definitely.
[63:38.75]Yep.
[63:39.57]Got, got, got, got, got!
[63:41.07]What?
[63:41.97]Oh, he's right there.
[63:43.69]Oh, my God.
[63:45.39]Oh, my God.
[63:46.29]Oh, my God.
[64:00.34]What is this guy doing?
[64:03.88]He's on a fucking rampage!
[64:07.34]I gotta hide.
[64:13.74]I need a thing.
[64:14.32]I need... I'm exposed.
[64:16.04]I'm exposed.
[64:16.63]Where are they?
[64:17.33]Lady right here?
[64:19.67]Oh yeah!
[64:21.55]It's alright.
[64:23.15]Stop that.
[64:25.49]Oh, it was you and you.
[64:26.43]Alright, I'm... I'm doing alright.
[64:30.60]I have to get out of here.
[64:31.56]Fuck.
[64:32.12]Oh, fuck.
[64:32.72]Oh, fuck.
[64:34.12]Where are they?
[64:35.70]Just be in this... Oh, you were in the circle.
[64:39.36]You were inside the circle.
[64:45.59]I ran right into the circle.
[64:46.73]Of course it was me.
[64:48.09]All right, don't blow it.
[64:51.01]I got a commanding lead in the first place.
[64:54.43]Wait till I get a new quarry.
[64:55.37]Same floor.
[64:58.85]They're going to be in this room right here.
[65:00.09]There they are.
[65:01.55]That's this lady right here.
[65:07.72]Watch out for my killer.
[65:13.12]When you see somebody turn a corner there, I'm just going to activate it.
[65:17.82]One floor below.
[65:18.52]Let's go this way.
[65:24.36]Give me that weapon.
[65:32.91]I want full exposure here.
[65:34.83]A lot of tap-tapping of running around.
[65:39.94]Alright, they're coming up the stairs now.
[65:44.90]They should be on the same floor.
[65:47.08]No, not yet.
[65:48.58]Hunter is near, though.
[65:49.90]I'm going to activate my...
[65:54.60]Yeah, you're under arrest.
[66:02.30]So wait, if I attack that person, will I go to... Am I going to get in trouble for that?
[66:09.97]Or should I have stunned?
[66:12.29]I'm not sure if I should have done that or not.
[66:16.49]Okay, in the same floor.
[66:20.84]Am I still... I think I'm still that person's target.
[66:29.63]Yeah, I was.
[66:34.61]One floor above.
[66:38.81]I want full.
[66:41.35]Oh, that was a player.
[66:43.79]That guy keeps getting arrested.
[66:48.18]Yeah, that was a Jeremy.
[66:49.64]And I've learned to not be Jeremy.
[66:52.52]I'm doing a different approach.
[66:55.52]Same floor.
[67:00.55]That's a person.
[67:01.45]Hopefully they're not my hunter.
[67:02.33]Alright, they're in this room.
[67:04.03]We're gonna be able to figure out who they are in three seconds.
[67:19.78]Where are you?
[67:20.64]Oh, fuck.
[67:21.72]I don't know who it is.
[67:23.88]Okay, I'm getting out of here.
[67:25.64]They're in that room.
[67:26.30]I don't know where they are.
[67:27.24]The first person that walks in this door is my killer.
[67:32.98]Oh fuck, I gotta make something happen here, man.
[67:36.26]I can't be just complacent about this.
[67:40.42]One floor below.
[67:46.00]They are right down here.
[67:48.64]Shit, I gotta make something happen right now.
[67:50.63]One minute left.
[67:57.17]Where the fuck are you?
[68:02.79]Shit.
[68:06.49]Oh, come on.
[68:08.82]Let me just run out with the... It was this guy, wasn't it?
[68:10.94]No, it... It is this person.
[68:14.98]What's going on right now?
[68:16.10]I'm fine.
[68:16.30]Everything's fine.
[68:17.28]I gotta get one person.
[68:31.32]No, just focus on getting the last person.
[68:41.69]What the fuck?
[68:42.49]I... So I can't hit that guy.
[69:02.79]I got it!
[69:03.29]I had it!
[69:03.87]That was mine!
[69:04.69]That was me!
[69:07.02]Oh my god.
[69:08.04]Give me a fucking break.
[69:12.98]That's such bullshit.
[69:19.14]Alright, well now for future, I didn't know that.
[69:20.92]Like, I thought that even if they're getting arrested, that I could like, slap them, because then I'm technically still their quarry, right?
[69:32.39]Didn't even know I Thought that even if they get arrested like I can go up and hit them because that it's like that they got stunned No What a bunch of dog shit The guard yeah get the fucking guards out of the game pointless I
[70:12.17]Mad.
[70:14.07]What purpose do the guards serve?
[70:17.01]I don't see a purpose for the guards.
[70:18.37]I don't.
[70:38.12]Stop looking at the scoreboard.
[70:42.83]The guard can serve as protection during... But yeah, but if... Okay, so if a guard, like, essentially stuns somebody... I'm technically still their quarry, so... What do I have to do?
[70:53.52]I now just know who it is, and I just hope I click first when he comes in the room that I'm in afterwards?
[70:57.59]I mean, if counter is in the game, the guard seems like the most meaningless addition.
[71:10.24]If, you know, let's just be real.
[71:33.11]Remember, I will only work with the most entertainingly murderous.
[71:37.75]Fucking guards.
[71:38.63]Guards are stupid.
[71:39.25]I don't like this game.
[71:40.53]No, this game's fun.
[71:43.82]It's definitely, I wonder who it is.
[71:47.26]It's you right here.
[71:47.96]I need a weapon.
[71:49.30]Give me that five weapon baby right there.
[71:52.68]Hunter right behind me.
[72:03.78]Pick it up.
[72:04.50]Get it.
[72:06.44]Hunter's up the stairs?
[72:07.22]It's right there.
[72:09.16]They don't know that I know that they're the hunter.
[72:10.90]And there they go.
[72:15.42]That dude right there.
[72:16.38]Same floor.
[72:17.56]They're going to be walking in here in a second.
[72:21.37]Turn that corner.
[72:22.11]Hunter is near.
[72:22.61]Right there is this lady.
[72:26.37]She took a right.
[72:34.26]She is.
[72:35.60]We stalk our prey.
[72:49.70]Come on.
[72:50.14]Stand somewhere, lady.
[72:52.47]Make the... There we go.
[72:53.35]Make it nice and easy for me.
[72:57.95]Oh, don't mind if I do.
[73:03.10]I'm thinking this is going to be a hunter behind me, no?
[73:07.04]I'm good.
[73:08.32]Let's get a new weapon.
[73:11.55]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[73:15.31]Boy, oh, boy.
[73:16.17]You weren't looking for me.
[73:17.05]I knew you were a hunter, but... Okay, I thought that.
[73:21.05]I need a weapon.
[73:29.22]Nick, I'm not after you.
[73:30.04]You're not after me.
[73:30.78]Wonderful.
[73:34.38]Straight ahead.
[73:34.92]Alright.
[73:35.80]There's a dumb guard.
[73:37.78]Dumb.
[73:38.94]Dumb.
[73:40.60]Got out hunted.
[73:41.42]Dumb.
[73:43.25]Where's this hunter?
[73:49.03]Straight across from there.
[73:49.97]Okay.
[73:50.47]Same floor.
[73:51.09]He's gonna be coming in this door right here.
[73:55.96]Yep.
[73:56.60]I'll catch them right here.
[73:59.68]Take a left.
[74:06.84]I could get... Yeah, it's this guy right here.
[74:20.97]Any hunters nearby?
[74:21.77]Give me that weapon.
[74:24.65]We're going to stand in this room.
[74:26.57]I'm up by about 10 points.
[74:27.71]I need to get my exposure up.
[74:38.70]I've got a feeling this guy's a hunter.
[74:41.28]Same floor.
[74:43.28]Take a turn and come in this room.
[74:45.20]I know you're going to come in here.
[74:48.58]Same floor.
[74:49.40]Alright, fine.
[74:51.60]I'll investigate.
[74:52.30]He's crossed the way over there.
[74:57.42]I don't know.
[74:57.74]I don't trust this dude.
[74:58.46]Is this lady?
[75:05.36]I've got the fucking guard!
[75:06.96]All right, so you see, that's what I wanted to do.
[75:09.44]So where the fuck isn't he getting arrested?
[75:35.17]So, the guard procs on somebody, and then they're cooled down.
[75:46.81]So, if somebody gets caught, and then everyone has free reign to do whatever the fuck they want up here.
[75:53.87]Eat my ass.
[75:57.39]If only you got them first.
[75:59.81]What then, eh?
[76:06.98]Alright, back to it.
[76:09.05]One floor below.
[76:09.75]Let's go around.
[76:14.85]Ah, somebody's a hunter right here.
[76:15.77]Alright, the person's exposed.
[76:24.64]Who are you?
[76:27.70]That's that person right there.
[76:29.94]And I... Oh my god.
[76:42.64]Fuck.
[76:49.93]Well, it's definitely... It's definitely that lady over there.
[76:55.11]If I were to take a... No, it's not.
[76:56.39]I think they're up there.
[76:58.96]Down.
[77:04.92]No, I was doing alright.
[77:10.48]Straight this way...
[77:14.58]Okay, who the fuck is it?
[77:16.06]I think it's somebody over here.
[77:19.89]There's a fucking guard here now.
[77:22.49]So I can't, I think it's this guy right here.
[77:25.37]No?
[77:26.83]It's definitely that guy.
[77:27.95]But I can't attack this guy.
[77:31.23]Right?
[77:31.41]I mean, I'm being so obvious right now.
[77:37.12]But like, that guy's on cooldown now?
[77:39.48]Is that what I'm understanding?
[77:44.22]No, they were... Oh, my God.
[77:48.16]All right, so he falls asleep.
[77:51.42]He wasn't even the right person.
[77:57.53]I'm just running up here.
[78:13.06]They're right behind me.
[78:16.48]Sitting in that circle somewhere.
[78:20.73]Let's see if I can find them.
[78:22.53]Hunter, it's this person right here.
[78:24.33]And I knew it.
[78:24.79]And I fucking tried to click.
[78:26.41]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[78:27.77]I should have just countered.
[78:32.88]I was doing so well, too.
[78:34.40]What the fuck?
[78:35.40]This is such bullshit.
[78:36.38]Yeah, good one.
[78:46.74]Yeah, this is multiplayer.
[78:48.79]I'm being followed right now.
[78:50.11]That person's a hunter.
[78:54.57]Get away from me, please.
[78:56.43]Can I get a fucking point?
[78:57.71]Can I get one point in the last eight minutes, please?
[79:06.03]Another fucking hunter.
[79:07.11]I thought it was her.
[79:09.11]It's this guy.
[79:09.71]Okay.
[79:20.41]Same floor.
[79:23.87]I got ten points lined up here.
[79:26.03]For the love of God, this person's crossed the whole fucking ship.
[79:39.00]Don't hunt me.
[79:41.70]With one kill, I go into second place.
[79:44.98]Does God give it to me?
[79:51.94]Try not to think too badly of them.
[79:58.67]I get one kill and I'm in second place.
[80:01.81]It's not that lady, no.
[80:02.87]They have to be in this left room here.
[80:04.45]Okay, they just turned out.
[80:17.57]But they're gonna be standing right here.
[80:18.97]Yeah.
[80:19.39]Okay.
[80:19.83]I don't know who it is though.
[80:20.75]So let's find out this guy.
[80:23.33]And the hunter's right there too.
[80:24.61]Counter, counter, counter.
[80:29.48]There we go.
[80:32.04]Back in second place.
[80:35.12]One goddamn maneuver.
[80:39.47]I need the brass knuckles.
[80:47.03]That person's suspicious.
[80:48.27]I knew it!
[80:49.49]I could feel it!
[80:51.45]What's going on?
[80:52.93]What?
[80:53.13]Oh, that person guessed wrong.
[80:56.65]I wasn't their target.
[80:57.53]Okay.
[80:58.68]What?
[80:59.72]Oh god, I'm exposed.
[81:06.50]I'm exposed!
[81:07.86]I'm exposed.
[81:09.40]Get me to stand in a circle quick!
[81:12.43]They know where I am!
[81:17.12]I don't think I'm catching this guy in 15 seconds.
[81:24.56]Such dishonorable play does rather suggest an early ejection from the ship.
[81:32.50]Alas, our happy times of murderous innocence are over.
[81:37.83]Fuckin' guard.
[81:38.67]Stupid.
[81:38.85]Mr. X is a right gent.
[81:40.81]I'll have no one say no different.
[81:48.44]stop exposing yourself how do I not understand basic game mechanics I understand pretty much everything in the game though I know it tells you when a hunter is nearby I'm aware how do you think I backhanded like 17 people so far just by guessing
[82:16.95]All the people that have, like, walked over to me and it's been, like, hunters by nearby and I backhand them.
[82:21.03]That was just... I just guessed randomly, apparently.
[82:26.21]That was me just randomly guessing every time, I guess.
[82:31.12]Let's go back to this guy.
[82:47.48]Passive-aggressive.
[82:50.18]Oh, come on, like, give me a break.
[82:54.26]I, like, misclick on somebody and all of a sudden, like, I am stupider than a fourth grader.
[83:03.47]How the fuck do you not understand that?
[83:04.83]What are you, stupid?
[83:05.49]What are you, second grade?
[83:07.55]Like, I clicked on a guy. ...
[83:21.75]Are you smarter than a fifth grader?
[83:22.99]I don't know.
[83:35.86]Stupider.
[83:49.25]Hey, I'm a second grader.
[83:50.27]Lay up.
[83:53.27]Somebody didn't ready up?
[83:54.17]Oh, what the fuck?
[83:54.73]What are you stupid?
[83:59.47]Oh, I didn't even type.
[84:00.09]There's a guy already nearby.
[84:01.45]Where is he?
[84:01.83]Who is it?
[84:02.31]Okay.
[84:02.53]Lower bump.
[84:21.16]No, we already lost that.
[84:21.98]I want to get my skill up.
[84:23.36]I need a weapon.
[84:23.88]Give me that.
[84:24.46]Give me that gun.
[84:32.06]They're one floor above, and they're to the left.
[84:39.25]There was a hunter in the room for a second.
[84:42.45]Alright, who do we got?
[84:43.35]Ooh, where are you?
[84:49.59]Got you.
[84:51.65]Don't even... What happened there?
[84:56.49]So the stun breaks my counter?
[84:58.94]Is that how that works?
[85:00.08]Because I countered right before he did that.
[85:02.72]Apparently.
[85:06.62]I guess.
[85:07.00]They're right up there.
[85:19.36]Give me that weapon.
[85:22.89]Hunters nearby.
[85:23.53]Fuck.
[85:23.71]I don't know who it is.
[85:24.47]Fuck.
[85:24.81]Fuck.
[85:25.29]Don't you... Fuck it.
[85:31.37]Okay, so now I have to do this.
[85:34.19]Right?
[85:34.45]Like... I understand now.
[85:36.45]Where's my quarry?
[85:37.25]Where the fuck is my quarry?
[85:38.73]Who is it?
[85:39.47]Who is my quarry?
[85:40.49]Holy shit.
[85:41.17]Where are they?
[85:41.53]They're standing right next to me.
[85:42.38]Is it the guy in the fucking beanbag shirt?
[85:46.18]No.
[85:46.76]He walked this way.
[85:52.27]Hunter again.
[85:52.89]I'm going to just... I'll follow him.
[85:59.89]He's in here.
[86:00.69]Oh, yeah.
[86:02.47]I was going to go after that guy, too.
[86:04.19]That was the guy I was going to try to attack.
[86:05.55]Oh.
[86:05.61]Oh.
[86:17.91]Oh, that's just a shitty gun.
[86:21.17]Um, oh well.
[86:23.91]Let's go down.
[86:25.81]No, I can get that.
[86:26.65]That's only two.
[86:27.21]I don't give a shit.
[86:31.26]I'd rather catch the person first.
[86:33.32]There's probably a weapon down here, too.
[86:38.84]Scared of this guy.
[86:39.90]That guy's acting really fucking weird.
[86:41.47]Okay.
[86:55.23]Okay.
[86:57.61]Well.
[86:58.65]Well, where's the hunter?
[87:00.44]Where's the hunter?
[87:02.90]Counter!
[87:04.56]Where's my hunter?
[87:07.46]Where's the hunter?
[87:08.42]I am actually fucking freaking out now.
[87:14.01]I'm exposed.
[87:14.93]I don't know if you're my hunter.
[87:19.79]Are you?
[87:21.59]No.
[87:22.13]I need to sincerely get this back built up again.
[87:30.43]He probably already saw it.
[87:31.21]This guy right here.
[87:34.77]I can't do it though because of the stupid god damn bastard guard that's staring at me.
[87:41.26]That's my mirror is the target.
[87:53.10]This is the target.
[87:56.28]Wait, what's happening?
[87:59.46]That wasn't my target.
[88:01.12]That is.
[88:05.93]If you continue to entertain my every murderous request, I think you'll go far.
[88:12.27]This is the Hunter Rider.
[88:15.87]Oh, that's such bullshit.
[88:18.10]Come on, man.
[88:18.86]Every time.
[88:19.44]Such bad goings on.
[88:20.74]No deck.
[88:22.31]Dude, alright.
[88:24.03]Here's another complaint.
[88:26.79]So if you're a hunter and you have the flashbang, you can literally just sprint around the room until you figure out who it is and then flashbang and get him every time.
[88:35.07]Like, you can literally just run circles around sprinting around the room and then drop a flash and then get the person.
[88:41.21]What?
[88:41.41]In the name of God.
[88:45.39]This is a hunter right here.
[88:46.81]This lady.
[88:49.06]Oh, God.
[88:52.84]It was the guy that was in the circle with me.
[88:56.18]I spawned in the circle and he...
[89:19.14]Can I have a quarry?
[89:21.01]Forget about the eyeballs, just do the flashbang in the counter.
[89:23.91]Uh, there's a lady up there, maybe.
[89:25.87]Soothe your vile rage.
[89:53.97]Same floor.
[89:59.18]Um... Hunter is near.
[90:04.18]I mean, okay, if the flashbang hit like two people, but you could flash a whole fucking room of people.
[90:12.37]It hits fucking everybody in like a five mile radius.
[90:15.33]Alright, this is dangerous.
[90:22.51]I panicked.
[90:23.61]It was my target.
[90:25.81]I really thought I was going to get attacked.
[90:36.68]Alright, this game's fun.
[90:37.88]I'm actually, like, heavily enjoying this.
[90:41.96]I'm having actually a very... This is a good game.
[90:43.84]I'm having fun.
[90:44.48]Ooh, that's what I want.
[90:51.49]Alright, let's climb the leaderboards here.
[90:54.52]Floor below.
[90:55.34]I need to kill one person.
[90:58.72]That's my Ethereum address.
[91:01.56]I keep forgetting to get rid of that.
[91:06.48]I don't think that's not a hunter.
[91:09.61]I like the ship more.
[91:13.11]I always thought the ship had to be played with a bunch of people that were in the same cult.
[91:19.69]that's what I thought all right here they come I'm gonna counter this guy where are they holy you are far away
[91:51.40]That's a hunter right there.
[91:53.70]The lady that just ran right by me was a hunter.
[91:56.58]So this might be too.
[91:58.78]Shut up!
[92:02.90]Of course, and I knew who it was too, and I fucking knew it.
[92:06.28]I just did not think there was ever a possibility why that person would run through the room and not come get me.
[92:16.63]That guy's sprinting around.
[92:17.91]Of course it's that guy, but he ran by me.
[92:26.70]He, like, turned around.
[92:27.78]Above.
[92:33.29]I think he, like, up the stairs.
[92:51.87]Expose ourselves for a second.
[92:55.09]Alright, you are going away from me.
[93:03.50]Still going the other way.
[93:05.80]Look at that.
[93:06.70]That's fair.
[93:07.20]Aquarius left the game.
[93:12.75]Chased me around the whole ship, and then I'm gone.
[93:17.47]I think I just got lucky right here.
[93:24.61]I'm trying to... Give me a fucking break, man.
[93:29.82]Like this, that was mine.
[93:31.70]That was mine.
[93:33.48]Why?
[93:35.44]Blast it all.
[93:36.64]Are we not sociopaths of noble intent?
[93:41.01]Deary me, do try to evade such trifling attentions.
[93:46.43]This is a serious business.
[93:52.29]I think we need a refresh here.
[93:53.51]This game used to seriously prioritize targets, so you can just stand on NPCs and be much safer.
[94:22.10]Or maybe hold the mouse button.
[94:25.81]And let it go.
[94:27.87]Maybe when you hold the mouse button, you can actually target and let go when you have the right person, rather than just like, fuck, fuck, fuck, click!
[94:44.80]I wanna do one more.
[94:46.60]Maybe one or two more.
[94:47.58]I'm not... Actually, I like the game.
[94:49.92]The actual core video game is fun.
[94:54.41]be doxy I'm going to use I like reveal though but reveal just feels like it's just a bad flash like I can I like it though I'd like to use it oh wait I mean can I do I have any earn 250 I have to do it as the character okay so I've just been wasting time this whole time
[95:28.79]I need to, like, stretch my abdomen.
[95:38.86]Ugh.
[95:43.04]This is gonna become my Fortnite.
[95:44.74]No, it's not.
[95:47.21]It's not gonna become my Fortnite.
[95:51.76]Explain the game.
[95:52.36]Alright, for those of you that have no idea what's going on, I'll explain.
[95:55.88]So, this is a game where there are eight players and a bunch of NPCs that all look alike.
[96:05.68]And it's my job, everybody gets a target, right?
[96:08.64]So the game spawns, you get a target.
[96:11.64]One of the eight human players is one of your, is your target.
[96:15.51]You have a little indicator, and when you're getting close to them, you have to kill them.
[96:19.15]Before somebody kills you.
[96:21.73]It's just a game, it's just a giant circle of, I'm targeting you, targeting that guy, targeting him, targeting him.
[96:26.52]And you have to fit in and use psychology and stealth and flashbangs and counters and guards.
[96:37.40]Why am I spawning in this room?
[96:46.30]I never played the Assassin's Creed one, but I... I... It's very similar.
[96:51.63]I've seen it be played.
[96:52.59]Actually, I think I did play the one on Assassin's Creed.
[96:56.81]Long time ago.
[96:58.49]And I played it for like five minutes and didn't understand it, so I quit.
[97:03.53]I wasn't like a big fan of Assassin's Creed anyways, but I just saw who it was too.
[97:06.77]Alright.
[97:10.99]The whole goal is... There's no reason to ever attack anybody unless you have five exposure bonus.
[97:19.11]They're about to walk in this room.
[97:20.57]So just be patient.
[97:24.31]They are in the room now.
[97:26.00]It's one of these two ladies.
[97:27.30]It's this lady right here.
[97:30.70]No, it's not.
[97:31.38]Holy shit, it's not.
[97:32.66]Wow.
[97:33.60]Wowee.
[97:34.60]I was wrong.
[97:35.44]Wowee.
[97:36.94]So who the fuck are you?
[97:40.17]It was that lady.
[97:40.89]It was the other one.
[97:47.53]Wowee.
[97:48.07]Who is it?
[97:51.01]It's the person I'm standing right next to.
[97:52.49]No, it's not.
[97:52.87]It's that lady.
[97:53.45]Wowee!
[97:53.73]Wowee.
[98:00.60]Alright, I need a new weapon.
[98:05.82]Nine points.
[98:19.49]This looks like a hunter.
[98:21.01]But probably not coming for me.
[98:23.61]Good.
[98:26.81]That's good.
[98:29.19]But now I have a hunter near me and that scares me.
[98:38.50]One floor above.
[98:41.82]Who's the hunter?
[98:42.92]Don't be you.
[98:44.27]Don't have it be you.
[98:53.01]Somebody just slipped on a banana peel upstairs.
[98:54.53]Alright, they're walking the other direction.
[98:57.39]I got nine more points.
[98:59.71]Exposed!
[99:05.66]New weapon?
[99:16.84]I would like a new weapon.
[99:22.93]Two hunters in the vicinity.
[99:23.93]I think it might be that lady right there.
[99:26.46]Yeah, it's one of these people.
[99:29.62]Exposed again.
[99:31.91]You gotta watch your exposure, man.
[99:36.83]Huh?
[99:40.34]I really... It was that lady right in front of me there, but I just wasn't 100% confident it was the lady with the fucking hat on.
[99:47.04]I just needed to double check and that's what got me killed.
[99:55.17]Still have the weapon.
[100:06.58]Same floor.
[100:07.26]I think it's that lady.
[100:11.68]This lady that literally just walked in there.
[100:15.68]I wonder who it is.
[100:16.36]I wonder.
[100:20.02]Oh, come on.
[100:20.85]Really?
[100:22.33]You just whipped around.
[100:24.47]I've tried that before and it didn't work.
[100:26.53]Just three.
[100:30.35]Give me this.
[100:31.13]Who is it?
[100:37.94]I was trying to bait it out.
[100:38.98]Just by standing still.
[100:41.80]There's this lady right behind me.
[100:48.78]What?
[100:49.56]It wasn't.
[100:51.89]That wasn't who the... What is it?
[100:54.69]Why are they doing this?
[100:59.39]What?
[100:59.93]Hold on a second.
[101:00.69]Hold on now.
[101:01.15]Why did I get stumped?
[101:06.68]If that was... You get arrested even if you're trying to stop getting killed?
[101:11.94]I thought it was only on a kill, not on a block.
[101:20.48]Okay.
[101:21.72]That's interesting.
[101:29.52]If you get arrested, the stun doesn't go through.
[101:31.05]I was just trying to stun that person.
[101:33.17]That's how I got arrested.
[101:37.13]He slashed.
[101:37.71]It's the same button.
[101:41.12]It's the same button.
[101:44.88]This lady right next to me.
[101:48.36]See, okay, so... That's who I need to kill.
[101:51.01]This person's dead now because this guy's on cooldown.
[101:56.02]That just happened to me.
[101:59.17]That person right now is raging at their computer right now.
[102:03.45]That's what happened.
[102:06.59]That's just how it works, I guess.
[102:19.21]That doesn't, that doesn't seem very fair.
[102:20.83]Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
[102:25.52]It's this guy right behind me.
[102:26.42]There's two people in here.
[102:28.67]It's this lady right here.
[102:29.65]It's both of them.
[102:33.51]He's not certain, though.
[102:35.49]Both of them are not certain.
[102:39.90]I gotta play this cool.
[102:40.92]I'm gonna walk just this way, straight ahead.
[102:47.44]Yeah, they're not certain about it, so they're not gonna do it.
[102:49.85]And plus, the police officer's here.
[102:53.92]Oh, Hunter is near again.
[102:54.94]It's the Lady Raider.
[102:59.79]Well, there you are.
[103:01.65]Like, that's, like, really?
[103:07.73]What the fuck are you doing?
[103:09.65]Come on.
[103:11.75]What the?
[103:12.49]Oh, this is so frustrating.
[103:19.88]Oh, yeah.
[103:21.56]A strange save.
[103:29.18]delete that fucking guard man not you where are you though down below okay delete delete
[103:56.83]Alright, that's the guy right here.
[103:58.09]The guy eating the potato over here.
[104:03.25]3, 2, 1, action.
[104:06.96]Oh.
[104:08.08]Well, it's the lady in the green dress.
[104:10.08]No, it's not you.
[104:11.46]It's not.
[104:12.00]I was just completely wrong.
[104:13.64]It's the other guy.
[104:14.60]It's the other big guy.
[104:17.76]I knew it was a big guy.
[104:19.08]I just apparently saw the southern.
[104:21.08]It was incorrect.
[104:23.53]There you go.
[104:25.33]I'm coming to get you.
[104:28.63]I didn't mean to do that.
[104:29.43]No, it wasn't even a big guy.
[104:31.15]I was wrong.
[104:32.07]Incorrect.
[104:32.35]Oh, my fucking stomach is telling me...
[104:57.63]Are you doing a... If I take your mask off?
[105:00.55]Is that from Bane?
[105:02.13]One floor below.
[105:03.51]Hydrate.
[105:04.81]I have a water right here.
[105:08.83]That's not the problem.
[105:28.90]I smelled it.
[105:29.52]I was wrong, though.
[105:33.00]Too many hunters here.
[105:33.68]I'm getting out of here.
[105:34.64]I'm going down below.
[105:36.78]Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint!
[105:43.12]Dehydrate.
[105:45.44]I'm about to be exposed.
[105:49.82]Actually, I'm... No, there's a guy that's... There's always somebody that has, like, a hundred points.
[105:56.05]Now they're upstairs.
[106:06.56]Which room were you in?
[106:07.80]Oh, I think you are one of these people standing right here.
[106:12.46]No, you were the lady in the dress.
[106:14.82]Isn't that interesting?
[106:19.16]That, I was about to be very upset.
[106:24.05]I was trying to press E!
[106:25.15]Well, these Jubilee celebrations were certainly more stabby than I expected.
[106:56.46]No, I'm not being that guy that's like well look at how funny I am with all caps in the fucking endgame chat
[107:07.72]I'm gonna do I want to do one more and then we'll see where we are I type fast for a hunt and peck
[107:37.04]pretty good let's go back to this dude one more and look for everything I'm saying about how the game I don't like some of the things in the game it's it's keeping my attention it's fun
[108:09.25]I erased that and he's watching the stream.
[108:10.73]He definitely just saw what I wrote.
[108:18.47]Put the mic close to the keyboard.
[108:24.18]I need to win again.
[108:27.54]I at least gotta come close.
[108:30.74]I came so close and I just blew it that last time.
[108:32.80]Let me make it happen.
[108:38.12]Got to string together like three or four.
[108:39.52]I had a great round earlier.
[108:42.90]And it just blew up my face.
[108:44.74]This lady is... No, apparently.
[108:49.40]Interesting.
[108:49.94]Okay.
[108:53.84]Was that... I thought that was my hunter.
[108:55.10]There's a weapon.
[108:55.64]Hey, I have the same idea.
[109:00.79]Hunter.
[109:09.76]Fuck.
[109:10.26]I don't like that.
[109:13.58]Down at the dinner.
[109:15.32]Let's get to 10 so I can get 10 points here if I get the skill.
[109:17.76]Hunter is nearby.
[109:18.62]I believe it is that guy that's been stalking me this whole time.
[109:21.90]Yes, it is.
[109:23.16]What is this?
[109:25.09]You're a disgrace.
[109:30.03]Dear, dear.
[109:31.50]Same floor.
[109:32.12]It's the lady right here.
[109:33.28]Two seconds.
[109:33.98]I have to play?
[109:34.86]Cool.
[109:35.10]It's the lady in the red dress.
[109:36.16]Hey!
[110:00.62]Five and three exposure.
[110:01.75]I'll take it.
[110:02.15]It's alright.
[110:04.75]What the fuck?
[110:06.25]Oh, okay.
[110:07.13]He wasn't... I gotta get out of here, man.
[110:09.23]I don't know what the hell that was.
[110:11.01]Hunter's near.
[110:13.47]Letty right there.
[110:17.45]That lady is definitely a hunter coming for me.
[110:21.17]No, that's too bad.
[110:24.33]Let's build up our exposure here.
[110:29.43]And find a weapon that is not won.
[110:32.13]Holy shit.
[110:35.05]Which one are you?
[110:39.12]That is unlucky.
[110:41.14]That sucks.
[110:41.76]That would have been an easy kill.
[110:51.87]He spawned and whipped around and pressed the button.
[110:58.03]Gun.
[111:02.35]Up to five again.
[111:03.13]I do have my counter back, which is good.
[111:08.61]This person's so far away they're probably going to get killed before I can get over there.
[111:16.09]I want to see who it is.
[111:18.97]Okay, yeah, it's the lady in the dress.
[111:24.56]That's fine.
[111:26.20]You can go ahead and run anywhere you want.
[111:27.66]I know who you are.
[111:30.93]I know what your plan is, and I know you're the lady in the dress!
[111:34.99]And you are currently hiding.
[111:36.45]And now we got this goddamn guard here.
[111:45.54]See?
[111:46.02]Uh, look!
[111:46.70]Everybody does it!
[111:47.94]Everybody does it!
[111:51.32]Everybody thinks the same way that everybody else thinks!
[111:53.80]And now I get free points.
[111:56.31]If we could shout about it, I'm sure the entire ship would be abuzz.
[112:02.42]Yep.
[112:03.80]Yep, yep, yep.
[112:07.72]Well, they did manage to get in first.
[112:09.57]Let's just wait for our quarry.
[112:16.07]Come on, I'm losing points here.
[112:17.25]I don't give a shit.
[112:26.42]Sometimes you gotta go.
[112:27.24]What are you doing?
[112:30.78]I... What was that all about?
[112:32.56]I knew that person was a hunter and I'm just spam clicking and all of a sudden I die from fucking 20 feet away?
[112:36.91]Whatever.
[112:56.55]Uh, in the bathroom?
[112:58.29]Maybe.
[113:00.31]No.
[113:01.99]They're gonna turn to this room.
[113:03.75]Is this guy already coming to know?
[113:06.31]No, it's not.
[113:06.93]Okay.
[113:08.79]No, they're above us.
[113:10.83]Same room, but above.
[113:11.61]The guns have range?
[113:16.51]Yeah, but I mean, I'm sitting there walking towards that guy.
[113:19.73]He just got to... The gun has... You can do that?
[113:22.47]I thought you had to be within a certain amount of...
[113:27.21]I always thought everything had the same range.
[113:28.87]Okay, he's in this room.
[113:33.47]Hunter's also nearby.
[113:34.43]Is this guy asleep?
[113:35.13]No.
[113:35.27]I think it's the lady.
[113:38.86]Don't do it.
[113:39.30]Yeah, it's the lady in here.
[113:42.36]No, it's not.
[113:45.68]It's the guy.
[113:46.89]It is that guy.
[113:56.60]Yep.
[114:00.33]That is so... Nothing about that is fair.
[114:04.99]How close am I?
[114:05.61]I'm pretty close.
[114:08.67]What's going on?
[114:12.05]What the fuck is this?
[114:16.35]What?
[114:23.68]This is my opportunity to win the game.
[114:25.98]He blew it.
[114:32.27]Now everyone knows who I am.
[114:33.37]Here he is.
[114:33.83]I'm not even going to let that happen.
[114:36.93]If I get a kill here, five, I need ten.
[114:38.07]I got three and a half minutes.
[114:39.19]37-47.
[114:39.39]If I get this five and five and I get a kill, I'll be in first place.
[114:56.07]This is a hunter.
[115:01.26]Okay, same floor.
[115:02.80]Gotta make this count.
[115:05.22]Alright, where are you?
[115:12.62]I think it's a lady walking in right here.
[115:14.88]It is.
[115:15.16]She knows it.
[115:17.58]She knows that.
[115:18.20]She's like, you were wrong!
[115:25.49]Please.
[115:26.71]Please?
[115:31.67]You really are helping to put the three M's into murder, murder, murder.
[115:37.81]I gotta keep it up.
[115:39.05]One more.
[115:39.51]I'll be satisfied with one more kill.
[115:42.45]Same floor, they're in the same place.
[115:43.89]It's this guy right here.
[115:46.77]The hunter's right behind me somewhere.
[115:51.35]Really?
[115:51.63]Oh, what?
[115:53.45]Shit.
[115:56.73]Damn it.
[115:57.37]That was the person that was below me.
[116:03.89]Well, I gotta get one more of these.
[116:05.13]I already have a hunter next to me.
[116:07.55]What is going on?
[116:08.11]What?
[116:08.43]I'm so confused right now.
[116:13.60]Oh, it was that?
[116:16.40]I'm so confused.
[116:25.02]What?
[116:26.74]Okay, so they, okay, I understand what happened.
[116:29.24]They both spawned at the same time, and that's where the confusion lies.
[116:33.75]Now again, all right, hold on.
[116:36.91]Is this this guy right here?
[116:39.40]What the fuck is that guy?
[116:48.50]It is this guy, and he's spamming left click right now.
[116:51.42]Oh my fucking god.
[116:52.68]Well, I need 10 points.
[116:54.24]And this is the opportunity.
[117:17.67]I gotta get one kill.
[117:18.67]52.
[117:19.67]I got one minute.
[117:25.59]Hello.
[117:26.21]He's over there.
[117:26.95]57 seconds.
[117:28.80]Just play it smart.
[117:31.42]There they are.
[117:32.04]Oh, come on.
[117:32.74]Really?
[117:33.02]What the fuck is this?
[117:35.16]What is this shit?
[117:35.84]Okay.
[117:46.15]Nah, now it's out of reach.
[117:59.12]It is now out of reach.
[118:00.84]Unfortunately.
[118:01.50]I'm just gonna try to sprint and try to catch this person.
[118:07.16]I don't even care if I'm exposed.
[118:10.13]Doesn't even matter.
[118:16.13]Arrested.
[118:16.83]Come and get me.
[118:17.69]Hey, how dare you do something like that.
[118:19.17]Ugh.
[118:46.66]I got to level five.
[118:51.46]Is that the Stanley Parable Navigator?
[118:53.84]Everyone's saying next.
[118:55.56]All right.
[118:57.12]I've had enough.
[119:01.00]All right.
[119:03.29]So how long have I been streaming for?
[119:06.45]Two hours and two and a half hours.
[119:07.59]I wanted to go for at least a few hours.
[119:09.93]What can we do for like 40 minutes?
[119:13.15]My stomach is really starting to bother me, so... In, like, 30 minutes, I'm gonna have to leave.
[119:17.31]I'm gonna have to leave.
[119:19.35]Uh, but don't worry.
[119:20.29]We'll make up for this this weekend.
[119:22.57]There's a lot of interesting stuff going on this weekend.
[119:25.72]So, let's see what I want to do.
[119:27.10]I'm not going to Garfield's card.
[119:32.02]Uh, let me see.
[119:32.94]I had a couple of things backed up.
[119:39.50]I could, maybe.
[119:42.26]Minecraft.
[119:43.06]No, I'm not going to play Garfield Guard.
[119:54.77]Why do you want me to play that again?
[119:56.99]Oh my God.
[119:58.25]Cookie, you gave $50.
[119:59.19]You gave $150 today.
[120:02.59]Like a few minutes ago.
[120:03.37]Cookie with another 50 bucks.
[120:07.25]Thank you, dude.
[120:09.01]Hey, Jeremy, this is Gary.
[120:10.19]I'm speaking on Todd's behalf.
[120:12.63]He killed himself because you broke the terms we agreed to.
[120:16.79]You said you would make sure not to read the message, and now our entire business has been exposed and is falling apart.
[120:21.71]Thanks, asshole.
[120:22.46]Never call us ever again.
[120:24.76]Why would you give me $50 to say this?
[120:28.84]Like, if this is a service that I paid for, why would somebody be like, oh, shit, quick, we got to give him $50.
[120:33.68]Like, your business is just bleeding money at this point.
[120:41.95]Oh, by the way, I wanted to show this on stream because I was very confused by this.
[120:47.30]Hold on, let me get it.
[120:48.88]I screencapped it specifically to show on stream.
[120:52.58]So, Conan Exiles is, like, releasing.
[120:55.90]It's, like, coming out of early access.
[120:57.19]Here it is.
[120:58.55]Can somebody please explain to me what is going on here?
[121:03.93]Conan Exiles is $29.99.
[121:05.33]Conan Exiles Barbarian Edition...
[121:10.98]is an extra cent.
[121:14.74]What's going on here?
[121:19.50]Is there one cent more of content in this Barbarian Edition?
[121:23.56]Because you got the Barbarian Edition, and then you have the Barbarian Edition upgrade.
[121:34.96]Literally.
[121:36.28]So wait, is that...
[121:39.55]So Conan Exiles is the base game, Barbarian Edition is the Barbarian Edition, and then the Barbarian Edition upgrade is $30 on top of buying the Barbarian Edition.
[121:57.60]What do you mean reading comprehension?
[122:00.96]So if I own Conan Exiles, I buy the Barbarian Edition upgrade.
[122:10.18]Upgrade as in upgrading the base game.
[122:13.88]So, I mean, remove the Conan Exiles here, man.
[122:20.82]Like, take this part out.
[122:23.06]Barbarian Edition upgrade.
[122:24.60]Not Conan Exiles.
[122:25.70]The Barbarian Edition upgrade.
[122:26.87]Excuse me.
[122:27.41]People are going to buy that thinking it's an extra cent.
[122:30.67]They're saving money.
[122:36.44]Because people are there buying Conan Exiles and the... Yeah, you got to be careful there.
[122:40.06]It's like buying the Diablo 3 expansion.
[122:49.77]No one will think that.
[122:51.17]Stop saying scent.
[122:52.31]Why?
