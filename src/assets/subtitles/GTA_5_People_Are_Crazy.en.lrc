[01:09.84]I'm gonna switch over.
[01:16.46]Officer, I don't know if you realize this or not, but there's somebody attached to the back of your car.
[01:21.27]Are you towing this guy?
[01:22.49]Are you supposed to be towing this guy somewhere?
[01:24.05]Well, I'm gonna take him off.
[01:26.71]You don't have a tow?
[01:27.37]There's no tow cab thing on the back of a cop car.
[01:29.81]There's no way he's towing this guy.
[01:31.35]Where the fuck are these two going?
[01:33.33]Yeah, that's a 10-4, taking the car to the dump.

[01:49.25]Hold onto your seats!
[01:51.26]Oh, that was a bad idea!
[01:55.32]Honest to God, this is the best thing to do in GTA Online.
[01:58.76]I'm not even driving the car, we're just holding up the double middle finger.
[02:05.33]Oh, do you want to drive your car, or would you rather give the middle finger out the window?
[02:09.15]I think I'd choose option two.
[02:14.59]No, this is my car.
[02:15.73]It's my car by default, because I stole it from you.
[02:17.83]Don't you get the laws of GTA?
