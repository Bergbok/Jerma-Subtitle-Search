[00:08.44]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.08]Jerma here with Basecamp Fortress 2, playing as the Scout on CTF Doublecross.
[00:21.81]And before we get into the video... God, playing Scout and talking, my brain will not be able to handle this.
[00:28.74]See you later!
[00:31.05]Today's my birthday.
[00:32.55]I am 27 years old.
[00:33.79]September 22nd, 2012.
[00:36.40]Jerma is 27.
[00:38.60]So, what does this mean?
[00:40.70]This means I'm getting old.
[00:42.30]I'm on the later part of my 20s.
[00:46.89]Because I used to be able to say I was in my mid-20s, and I can't really say that anymore because...
[00:51.59]7, 8, 9 is a lot closer to 30 than something like 24, 25, and 26.
[00:56.94]So now I am a full-fleshed adult.
[01:00.38]A real adult.
[01:02.06]Is that a spy?
[01:02.66]Oh my god.
[01:05.04]What is this guy doing, man?
[01:06.91]This guy's acting like a spy.
[01:08.71]There's nothing I can do besides try and get away from this guy.
[01:13.45]Oh my god.
[01:14.15]I actually got away.
[01:15.59]Oh!
[01:19.96]Oh!
[01:21.29]He caught me with a needle right in my back!
[01:24.52]Oh dear god!
[01:26.42]Good shot, Medic!

[01:59.54]This heavy medic pair, this is bad news.
[02:04.28]Oh, not anymore!
[02:06.54]This guy, come on, get out of here.
[02:08.38]No!
[02:12.71]Alright, I gotta get the intelligence.
[02:20.93]That's the number one thing here.
[02:22.38]Oh hey, so that's a spy.
[02:24.00]For sure.
[02:25.14]Bumped right into his butt.
[02:27.33]Oh, scout on scout.
[02:28.63]Scout on scout.
[02:29.78]More scout on scout.
[02:31.08]Who wants it?
[02:31.80]More!
[02:32.18]Who wants some of this?
[02:35.30]I'm dead.
[02:36.06]Oh, I'm so dead.
[02:37.34]Oh my god.
[02:38.90]How do I keep escaping from these things?
[02:41.16]I'm insane right now.
[02:44.00]Ooh.
[02:46.15]Something's going on.
[02:47.93]The gods of Team Fortress 2 are being insane.
[02:50.05]They are letting me do this.
[02:52.41]Because normally I would get myself killed in all these situations.
[02:55.01]So...
[02:58.50]Let me get that intelligence.
[03:02.98]Oh, I just heard a sentry.
[03:03.92]There's no way.
[03:05.94]Oh, it's not up yet.
[03:09.08]No, I didn't want to go this way.
[03:10.59]Oh, damn it.
[03:12.39]Oh, damn it.
[03:14.99]Oh, no.
[03:17.33]I did not want to do this.
[03:19.41]I'm dead.
[03:20.95]I can't even hit this guy.
[03:24.62]Oh my god, that was so lucky.
[03:27.12]I can't walk by here.
[03:29.08]I cannot, there's nowhere I can go.
[03:30.74]I might as well just sit here with my fingers in my face.
[03:34.08]Hold on, I can get up there.
[03:39.28]Come on, come on.
[03:41.22]God, this is embarrassing.
[03:46.26]Well, so I'll tell you a story while I sit here and can't jump over this thing.
[03:50.29]Oh, it's not up, it's not up.
[03:54.58]It's not up.
[03:56.72]Oh!
[03:58.30]Wow, that was, uh... Gotta use that.
[04:02.94]My noggin wasn't, uh, being functioning right there.
[04:06.18]Mmm.
[04:07.50]Unfortunately.
[04:10.57]See, are we gonna cap it?
[04:11.47]What's going on here?
[04:12.13]Let's cap that thing.
[04:17.25]Yay, I have a new rank on my strange scattergun.
[04:22.42]This guy is going to run into that.
[04:27.05]I just got so confused right there.
[04:28.93]No!
[04:33.87]I'll take this guy out.
[04:34.85]Right in his back.
[04:35.41]Come on.
[04:37.23]Spy up top.
[04:38.59]Oh, baby.
[04:39.19]Give me those crits.
[04:42.60]Get crit.
[04:43.42]Get crit.
[04:44.06]Where is he?
[04:45.22]Damn.
[04:45.64]Oh, man.
[04:50.83]Whoa!
[04:51.35]Whoa!
[04:53.01]What was... did I get him?
[04:54.17]At least I got him.
[04:55.65]Didn't get the heavy, though.
[04:59.66]Oh yeah, blueberry ice coffee, baby.
[05:02.78]But, the beginning of this video, before all this weird stuff started happening, um... I'm getting old, guys.
[05:08.82]I'm starting to feel kinda like Grandpa.
[05:11.80]My joints hurt, my neck hurts, my face hurts.
[05:15.80]I wake up in the morning sometimes and I'm just like, my god, what did I eat for lunch last night?
[05:21.48]I have diarrhea.
[05:22.48]Oh my god.
[05:24.94]But that is starting to happen now.
[05:26.36]I'm an actual real, real, real adult.
[05:28.96]And it's kind of scary.
[05:40.88]I'll get that guy up there.
[05:43.14]I will get that guy right now.
[05:46.29]Get me up here.
[05:46.87]Get me up the stairs.
[05:47.71]Around the corner.
[05:49.57]Around the bend.
[05:57.44]Take it out.
[05:58.84]Come on.
[05:59.04]Come on here.
[06:00.08]Come on.
[06:01.10]Come on.
[06:02.54]I can get that sentry.
[06:03.50]I can get it.
[06:06.74]I'm gonna get this sentry down.
[06:08.02]Come on.
[06:08.48]Yes.
[06:10.12]Wow.
[06:13.32]Ooh.
[06:15.88]Dammit!
[06:16.74]Get that!
[06:17.70]Oh, good job, Demoman!
[06:19.44]Dammit, I should have went for him first, because he was eating a sandwich.
[06:21.82]I should have killed him, and I should have killed the sandwich-eating heavy, but I didn't do that.
[06:24.20]I didn't get the... This respawn time is really, really long.
[06:30.83]We'll get it, and we're going to get it.
[06:31.79]We're going to win, for sure.
[06:34.47]Come on, guys.
[06:34.99]Come on, guys.
[06:35.49]Come on, guys.
[06:35.97]Somebody pick it up.
[06:38.73]The Ambassador.
[06:41.59]Here we are.
[06:43.20]Here we are.
[06:46.12]You are a spy.
[06:50.86]Take that.
[06:51.68]Take that!
[06:54.18]They got our intelligence.
[06:55.57]That's not cool.
[06:58.49]Not going in that front door.
[06:59.87]No bags.
[07:02.77]Go around the sewer.
[07:04.45]We'll go into the sewer and stink like a sewer rat.
[07:10.68]No, where am I going?
[07:14.06]Excuse me.
[07:16.28]I'm gonna get this.
[07:18.10]I'm gonna cap this.
[07:19.19]God damn.
[07:23.01]What?
[07:23.63]What?
[07:24.75]What the hell is going on?
[07:26.67]Oh, he's putting stickies down.
[07:28.13]Oh, he doesn't even know I'm there.
[07:34.86]Watch this.
[07:36.02]Oh!
[07:36.62]My god!
[07:38.74]Come on!
[07:39.28]Come on!
[07:39.72]Let's go!
[07:41.58]Come on, at least I'm going to get it.
[07:42.44]I'll get it far enough where somebody can get it on the other team.
[07:44.46]On my team.
[07:45.06]Come on, somebody pick that up.

[07:55.35]Just touch it, Spy.
[07:56.55]Oh, no.
[07:58.17]No.
[08:00.64]I'm going to get that.
[08:01.38]I'm going to cap it right now.
[08:03.88]Whoa.
[08:04.68]No, I'm not.
[08:07.41]What is this guy doing here?
[08:09.55]How do we get two people spawn camping?
[08:12.02]Spawn camping.
[08:14.78]Dude, let's go.

[08:30.63]Need to get that.
[08:31.29]Need to touch it.
[08:32.37]Need to touch it.

[08:34.68]Yes!
[08:35.36]Yes!
[08:35.94]Alright.
[08:36.50]Now somebody go over there and grab it.
[08:40.60]We can win this right now.
[08:41.68]We can win this right freaking now.
[08:43.40]Touch it.
[08:44.03]Come on, man.
[08:46.09]Good.

[08:56.31]It's gonna happen.
[09:02.16]Oh, now they got a soldier here.
[09:10.23]No!
[09:10.99]I got it, I got it!
[09:12.67]No, I'm getting stuck on stuff.
[09:15.05]Oh, this is it.
[09:16.81]That's not a spy.
[09:19.04]Where am I going?
[09:19.70]What am I doing that for?
[09:20.62]Oh my god, my brain just fried, but this is gonna be it.
[09:24.56]And... boom!
