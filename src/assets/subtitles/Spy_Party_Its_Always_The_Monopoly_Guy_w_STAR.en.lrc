[00:03.42]Oh, you know, you could be this guy with the book, too.
[00:06.00]This, like, Monopoly man.
[00:07.94]You're the fucking Monopoly man.
[00:09.12]Oh, Ben!
[00:13.81]Nope, it wasn't me.
[00:15.07]What?
[00:24.37]I'm pretty good at these things, I think.
[00:26.44]Well, you know, I'm going to know what they are.
[00:28.48]Yeah, I know.
[00:29.52]That's fine.
[00:30.94]I'm picking my spy.
[00:36.79]Alright, I'm ready.
[00:41.11]Are you?
[00:43.29]Because you're going to pick the Monopoly guy now.
[00:45.01]I'm going to see the Monopoly guy.
[00:46.71]Why would I be that stupid?
[00:48.61]Oh yeah, let me pick the guy that you would just... Yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:56.11]It's so scary.
[00:57.35]It's so scary because I can see the laser.
[01:01.85]Is it on your head?
[01:03.57]No, I can just see it.
[01:04.61]I can see the laser.
[01:06.08]I know.
[01:06.36]Well, do you see the laser on your head?
[01:08.52]The Monopoly guy?
[01:09.22]I can see the laser pointing into the room.
[01:11.16]That's all I'm telling you right now.
[01:22.45]I'm so scared.
[01:25.45]No, don't shoot me.
[01:26.51]Don't.
[01:27.13]Don't shoot me.
[01:30.29]in the psychology role.
[01:32.14]Oh, yeah.
[01:32.86]Well, I'm gonna get you.
[01:33.72]I think I've already got this figured out.
[01:36.80]You should be scared right now.
[01:38.42]You should be whimpering.
[01:43.02]Fuck!
[01:43.78]These guys are all suspected double agents, okay?
[01:47.10]So that means you're over here somewhere.
[01:51.12]You're in this crowd somewhere.
[01:53.81]Of course I'm in, this whole room is a crowd.
[01:55.83]No, no, no, you're in this crowd like over on the right.
[01:58.50]Because these guys were suspected.
[02:00.86]They were suspected criminals.
[02:03.12]And you're over here, you're one of these four people.
[02:06.84]How could I possibly be one of these four people?
[02:09.06]Because, I think you're the guy in the mustard jacket.
[02:13.56]What?
[02:13.78]I think you're the guy in the mustard yellow jacket.
[02:15.87]Who wears mustard?
[02:17.73]I got my eye on you.
[02:19.39]I got my eye on the mustard jacket.
[02:22.99]Okay, so now you said I'm out of here, which means you have to be one of these people, because how would you have known he even walked away?
[02:28.21]Oh!
[02:29.51]Oh, that's right, I just figured you out.
[02:33.92]You're one of the guys in the mustard-colored jacket.
[02:37.86]Okay.
[02:39.64]I don't know which one of them you are, but I know- or you're the lady.
[02:43.22]Alright, gray everybody else out, I know which one of these guys you are.
[02:49.79]Yeah, you're that guy, you're definitely that guy.
[02:54.09]Say your prayers.
[02:54.95]No!
[02:57.89]You're not good at this.
[02:59.69]You were the lady!
[03:01.25]I knew you were one of those guys or you were the lady.
[03:03.77]You're gonna be the freaking Monopoly guy again.
[03:09.65]You're just gonna play with the Monopoly guy every single time.
[03:15.59]This is a poker game.
[03:18.46]I'm not gonna give you any tells.
[03:22.01]Are there even 16 different party goers?
[03:24.77]I don't know.
[03:25.19]It looks like there are.
[03:27.05]I'm taking the shot.
[03:30.19]I was the Monopoly guy.
[03:32.63]I should have shot the Monopoly guy.
[03:40.88]I should have shot the Monopoly guy.
[03:42.74]Yeah, you really should have because it would have been like the Monopoly guy.
[03:47.00]Like it is every single time.
[03:50.14]You seriously better not pick him again.
[03:52.58]It's not gonna work.
[03:57.56]Hmm... This is tricky.
[04:00.46]I don't want to get it wrong.
[04:01.60]Do I have my suspicions?
[04:12.57]Screw your suspicions!
[04:15.51]My suspicions are squabbling.
[04:21.26]You don't have very much time.
[04:24.38]You haven't completed your missions.
[04:25.56]There's no way you have.
[04:32.44]Okay, okay.
[04:34.66]Screw you, Monopoly guy.
[04:35.90]I don't think it's you, but screw you.
[04:37.94]Are you kidding me?
[04:44.64]Oh, you made him the double agent.
[04:49.04]This is a weird stage.
[04:50.02]Like, I'm in the middle.
[04:51.10]I can't move.
[04:52.23]Really?
[04:53.15]Yeah.
[04:56.61]Someone's already in... Oh, that's not... That can't be you.
[05:00.91]Because that's the double agent as well.
[05:04.84]You can think whatever you want, bro.
[05:06.60]You can think whatever you want, bro.
[05:09.40]You want to know what I think?
[05:11.16]What do you think?
[05:12.06]Let's see it.
[05:12.88]I think there's a lot of statues here.
[05:15.42]There are a lot of statues here, I guess.
[05:17.25]You know what, Jerma?
[05:18.49]What?
[05:20.01]Safety is off.
[05:20.81]What do you mean the safety is off?
[05:22.71]Safety is off.
[05:26.21]Oh, you're going to shoot that guy?
[05:29.37]Do it.
[05:30.03]Shoot that guy right now.
[05:31.12]He's the next best thing to the Monopoly guy.
[05:34.34]Shoot him.
[05:34.98]Shoot him right now.
[05:35.90]Shoot that guy right now.
[05:37.74]No.
[05:38.42]Shoot him in the head.
[05:39.68]No.
[05:42.16]I'm taking my time.
[05:44.57]Blow that guy's fucking head clean off his shoulders.
[05:47.42]Who's this lady?
[05:48.16]Who's this lady looking at the freaking statue?
[05:49.98]Pay attention to the other guy.
[05:50.86]Yes, pay attention to that guy.
[05:51.72]No, no, there's a lady looking at the statue.
[05:53.08]No, that lady didn't do anything.
[05:54.24]That lady's going the other way.
[05:55.62]See?
[05:55.82]I'm telling you, this lady's going this way.
[06:08.01]Man.
[06:08.90]That guy's just like, I'm just staring at you.
[06:11.32]Why don't you shoot me?
[06:28.53]No!
[06:31.55]What is about to happen?
[06:33.43]Everything.
[06:34.87]Oh, every... Everything is about to happen.
[06:44.62]You ready?
[06:45.66]I'm ready.
[06:46.98]Okay.
[06:48.38]You have to hit accept.
[06:49.74]Hit accept.
[06:51.26]I was stretching.
[07:03.83]He was looking at me right from the start.
[07:05.51]He was staring right at me.
[07:06.65]I was like, no.
[07:08.07]No.
[07:08.57]I'm not having this guy show up to no more parties.
[07:24.31]Are you sure it's not him?
[07:27.17]I'm not... Okay, okay.
[07:31.73]You're picking him this time though.
[07:33.13]I know you can't resist.
[07:35.77]Can we please play a round?
[07:38.11]Yes.
[07:39.79]Where you do not instantly kill the Monopoly man.
[07:46.35]You could just watch my laser.
[07:50.56]That's fine.
[07:51.82]That's perfectly fine.
[07:56.45]Fucking Monopoly man, every time.
[08:06.21]What's he doing just standing over there?
[08:07.86]He's just standing over there.
[08:11.96]He's not doing anything.
[08:13.56]Too suspicious.
[08:15.02]No.
[08:18.48]Alright, I- I'm not shooting the Monopoly guy.
[08:24.34]I'm not going to shoot the fucking Monopoly guy.
[08:27.26]Instantly.
[08:30.67]What?!
[08:31.37]No!
[08:31.61]You missed!
[08:32.75]You missed!
[08:37.59]You're so bad.
[08:40.91]You took like a turn too quickly, I was- You had one job.
[08:45.05]Was to kill the Monopoly.
[08:47.53]Ugh.
