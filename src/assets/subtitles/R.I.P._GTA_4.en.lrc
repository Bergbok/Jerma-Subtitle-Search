[00:03.79]We're starting with this already.
[00:06.95]That is reserved for when you have nothing left to do.
[00:10.39]Put your best foot forward.
[00:11.93]No, no, the truck punchline is specifically reserved for when, like, oh, well, I have nothing else to do, we're not making any more jokes, might as well do the trucks.
[00:21.68]Fine, no, okay, fine, sure.
[00:26.96]What the fuck?! !
[00:30.22]What the f- What the hell, man?
[00:33.44]You know we've taken it too far at this point.
[00:36.49]What the hell, man?
[00:40.29]There's too many boats!
[00:41.93]I'm not sure I made enough boats.
[00:43.79]Batman and a giraffe in like a Ferrari.
[00:46.49]I love that it says get a life perfectly in frame and we're sitting here doing this shit.
[00:51.05]Get a life.
[00:53.62]I guess do it.
[00:55.54]I don't even know what's gonna happen, but go for it.
[00:57.72]Have fun.
[00:59.62]Good luck.
[01:05.85]One frame a second, hold on, I'm gonna get out of this soon.
[01:17.80]And they're gone.
[01:18.52]Just like that.
[01:20.58]They're gone.
[01:21.80]Just like that.
[01:22.72]They're all gone.
[01:23.64]No, they're still bouncing around the streets.
[01:26.06]They look like germs.
[01:27.02]They look like platelets.
[01:28.76]Like in a petri dish.
[01:31.36]I'm just jumping into the fucking boat hell.
[01:35.37]Yes!
[01:36.60]Yes, you're flying!
[01:38.30]Look at him!
[01:38.82]Yeah!
[01:39.38]Woo!
[01:39.98]You!
[01:41.44]What is going on?
[01:42.20]What's with all the Batmans attacking people?
[01:44.72]Oh, no!
[01:45.91]Once again, just get in the car.
[01:46.91]We have to go somewhere new, because Batman is throwing RPGs!
[01:58.55]He's not even dead, he just got back up!
[02:00.91]Is that the same Batman?
[02:02.76]I think it's the same Batman.
[02:05.62]This old guy over here.
[02:07.34]What?
[02:07.98]Sitting on the ledge, but not quite.
[02:10.68]Yeah, he is kind of just sitting there a little bit.
[02:13.48]What a weird spot to be sitting.
[02:16.42]Oh, let me guess.
[02:17.58]Batman's got something to say to this guy.
[02:20.18]I'm Batman.
[02:24.87]Oh, alright.
[02:33.13]Wow, they are kicking it out.
[02:39.81]I gotta stop the bad bat-bats.
[02:42.59]Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly... Let's go.
[02:54.74]The bench.
[02:56.44]The bench.
[02:57.98]What happened to the bench?
[03:00.43]You're gonna have a lot more questions real soon.
[03:08.16]What?
[03:11.11]What?
[03:13.21]What?
[03:15.25]It's the fucking Twilight Zone!
[03:17.59]Wow, dude.
[03:18.29]Okay, seriously, that was like a magician.
[03:21.95]You just did a David Bowie.
[03:23.57]No, not David Bowie.
[03:25.93]David fucking Bowie.
[03:28.02]You did David Copperfield.
[03:30.52]Oh, here's the elephant.
[03:31.40]Now the elephant's gone.
[03:34.68]Do you want an elephant?
[03:49.23]You unlock this door with the key of imagination.
[03:52.45]Beyond it is...
[04:09.39]Oh, my face hurts!
[04:14.22]Man, Disco Inferno.
[04:20.76]Alright, so dude, I'm taking you out to a fancy restaurant for the first time in a long time.
[04:30.37]You should be fucking happy about this.
[04:34.11]You should be grateful.
[04:35.09]This is a good restaurant.
[04:36.34]Oh, great acting, by the way, by Star.
[04:38.36]Fantastic.
[04:39.84]No, I was building a character around your wife who can't say actual words and just goes, You never hold my hand anymore.
[04:47.08]Well, I don't want to.
[04:48.08]Alright, let's go.
[04:49.15]Let's see.
[04:49.83]This is a nice restaurant.
[04:52.49]I don't know where the bartender is.
[04:53.93]He's probably in the bathroom.
[04:55.55]Did you see that One Star video?
[04:57.35]One Star video?
[04:59.37]Who's that?
[05:02.05]You're really gonna ruin this with a fucking truck punchline?
[05:06.67]You're really gonna ru- We had a bit going there, and you're gonna, like, just take a diarrhea on it with this fucking joke?
[05:12.79]Are you serious?
[05:15.43]You're, like, really upset.
[05:17.03]No, I just- Oh, I'm bi again.
[05:20.29]I'm out.
[05:21.01]I'm fucking out of here.
[05:22.71]Alright, he looks- He looks like the main character from Katamari Damacy.
[05:28.89]You know, Katamari?
[05:30.18]He's like, it's too heavy.
[05:34.20]He's just like, eh.
[05:37.12]I can't even explain to you.
[05:47.79]No, I'm coming for you, Jerma.
[05:52.93]I'm the box.
[05:55.73]Oh, no, no, no.
[05:59.43]No!
[05:59.91]Boats everywhere!
[06:02.09]You won!
[06:04.23]The clown in the town would be very difficult to do.
[06:06.67]Oh, God!
[06:11.38]Uh, coming in, uh, landing on the president's... boat.
[06:16.30]The skyscraper boat?
[06:19.60]He's wanted to... No!
[06:22.36]I'm not the best pilot.
[06:25.39]That's why they, uh, they assigned me to boat.
[06:28.75]This is what we're doing now.
[06:31.33]We're making skyscraper boats.
[06:32.85]That's what we're doing now?
[06:33.73]That's the thing now?
[06:35.47]Am I ready?
[06:36.06]I don't... No!
[06:54.52]Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to open that door into you.
[06:57.74]Are you okay?
[06:58.64]Dude, let me help you.
[07:01.12]I'm sorry.
[07:02.75]Alright, well, I'll let you get back to work.
[07:06.37]I don't really want to bother you anymore.
[07:08.51]Hey, Jim, Jim.
[07:09.77]I told you for the last time, we're working on Excel today, not Word.
[07:16.71]Get back to work, everyone.
[07:19.88]There are four people waiting outside for interviews.
[07:21.84]Where are they going?
[07:22.83]Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.
[07:24.95]Oh, Bill, how are you?
[07:26.11]How you doing, Bill?
[07:27.00]My pancreas doesn't work.
[07:32.96]What?
[07:33.34]What did I do?
[07:34.14]I'm not cruel, Bill.
[07:35.16]You're cruel.
[07:36.32]Listen, we gotta sit down and get this... Let's redo it.
[07:39.89]That pancreas lie just fucked me all up.
[07:42.11]Is there, like, a door we can...
[07:45.32]Yeah, okay, we have to like- What the fuck?!
[07:47.62]You'll have to do his work, I'm fucking sick of you!
[07:51.54]Oh my god!
[07:53.45]What's with you and the guns?
[07:56.29]It's a power move.
[07:57.75]Put the guns away.
[07:59.74]Hi.
[08:00.36]I'm a Ninja Turtle, and I make money by driving old ladies around.
[08:04.82]That's what I do.
[08:06.24]That's what I was born to do.
[08:07.50]Shit, that's what I'm going to keep on doing.
[08:09.32]So where are we going, old lady?
[08:11.08]We're going to 4th Avenue and 7th Street, please.
[08:27.77]He just keeps going, too.
[08:28.71]He just keeps laughing.
[08:30.01]I'm at the staircase with this other guy.
[08:31.89]I'm coming- I'm- Okay, Jerma, I'm coming to the staircase.
[08:34.46]Okay, good.
[08:38.18]You just chillin'?
[08:39.96]Yeah, he's just right here.
[08:41.36]Just chillin'?
[08:42.42]Yeah.
[08:42.62]Is that your new friend?
[08:43.41]What do you mean, is that my new friend?
[08:45.25]While I was gone, you got a new friend like you've replaced me that easy?
[08:48.93]Yeah, I did.
[08:49.79]You get a problem with that?
[08:54.82]Die or something!
[08:55.96]Die or do anything!
[09:02.79]Don't get new friends, Jerma.
[09:04.41]I'll find another.
[09:21.31]oh my god it is ridiculous
