[00:22.84]Wait a second.
[00:25.62]Wait.
[00:28.50]What is this?
[00:29.56]That was the most shocking thing ever.
[00:36.16]Why am I shooting a machine gun at people?
[00:38.28]What happened to the cutscene I was just watching?
[00:44.54]I was seriously gonna start saying stuff.
[00:45.92]I have no... I don't even know what to say.
[00:47.26]All I know is this.
[00:48.88]This was heavily requested.
[00:50.10]That I... What the fuck is going on?
[01:00.88]Look at this stupid control.
[01:02.46]Stop giving me control if you're just gonna take it away.
[01:07.28]What the hell?
[01:08.75]What the hell's going on?
[01:11.59]Wha- Why did the bike explode?
[01:25.58]What?
[01:26.84]What the f- No, don't even tell me.
[01:29.46]Don't even tell me his bike's gonna explode.
[01:40.05]No, oh, let's punch him and kick him and I wonder what's gonna happen to his bike Get the fuck out of here go blow up somewhere dickhead How does How did that not take them off their bikes and this guy would like his fucking lawnmower like is this guy driving a lawnmower?
[02:04.04]What is that thing?
[02:06.35]Seriously, get off like you have John Deere and fight like a man.
[02:09.89]Oh, here comes like another guy.
[02:11.05]I've been driving in a straight line for like at least a few minutes.
[02:20.01]How much further is it up down the road?
[02:22.17]Up down the road, yeah.
[02:23.61]Is that Scooby-Doo?
[02:24.95]Hold on a second.
[02:28.02]Hold on, I need to go see Scooby-Doo and the gang.
[02:30.78]Get on the bike!
[02:31.88]I have Scooby-Doo to track down!
[02:34.98]There it is!
[02:35.34]There it is!
[02:38.21]Go back!
[02:40.66]Go back!
[02:41.46]Oh my goodness!
[02:45.76]Alright, let's slow down a little bit.
[02:47.06]I need to see if... Okay.
[02:51.02]Okay.
[02:54.06]Alrighty then.
[02:54.70]I can't move?
[02:59.33]Okay, I can move.
[03:00.41]I got it.
[03:02.63]How do you... Okay, you can block by holding space.
[03:06.47]And that's a punch.
[03:07.17]Okay.
[03:09.63]Aw, sick combos!
[03:10.83]Uh-oh, look out, additional thugs.
[03:16.09]Just, so you just punch him in the face.
[03:20.03]So this game is equal parts terrible racing, equal parts awful beat-em-up.
[03:24.62]With a camera that doesn't even know where it wants to go.
[03:27.68]Can I grab him or something?
[03:28.62]Oh, are we only throwing punches that, like, drunk teenagers punch?
[03:34.40]Like, throw?
[03:38.10]Oh yeah, I did like a quick time event on you.
[03:41.05]Don't talk to my girlfriend like that.
[03:43.49]Don't talk to my girlfriend.
[03:45.33]She's my girlfriend.
[03:46.80]No, you are Slepler.
[03:48.22]I can't believe you.
[03:49.00]Yay.
[03:54.69]It's like fireworks, honey.
[03:55.95]Don't worry.
[03:57.55]Yeah, I've come to the conclusion this is probably the worst game I've ever played.
[04:01.04]In... at least this generation.
[04:03.08]I mean, like, something like Big Rigs Over the Road Racing, like you saw the last video in this kind of series.
[04:08.54]That game came out a long time ago.
[04:11.00]It had, like, a... This game doesn't have any excuses.
[04:14.30]This is a next-gen game.
[04:16.88]Why is it this bad?
[04:18.58]Why is this game this dumb?
[04:20.44]This is, like, a next-gen game for, like...
[04:24.08]I don't know.
[04:24.94]I have no answers.
[04:25.84]If somebody can give me the answer to that, I would love to hear it.
[04:33.21]What?
[04:35.13]Did his audio clip just cut off?
[04:40.73]You know Batman Arkham Asylum and, like, Arkham City and stuff?
[04:44.51]It's almost like they saw that game, and they said, that's a really good fighting mechanic.
[04:49.09]Let's, like, put that in our game, too.
[04:51.32]But the reason why that was so much fun in the Batman games is because you're fighting, like, a dozen people at the same time.
[04:57.62]And it's not just the same animation over and over again.
[05:01.50]It's a complete... Like, the countering system in Batman Arkham... This is like turning into, like, a Batman Arkham Asylum is a fun game video.
[05:08.44]Which it is.
[05:09.66]I mean, who can deny that?
[05:11.46]Batman Arkham City, Arkham Asylum, Arkham Origins I'm sure is gonna be good.
[05:15.55]Can we talk about something good and not something bad?
[05:18.39]Who is this?
[05:18.77]Is this Macho Man Randy Savage?
[05:21.07]Or is that Mr. T?
[05:27.28]This aiming system, honest to God, I think it's trying to make me.
[05:31.88]I think it's trying to auto-aim for me, but there's no option to turn it off.
[05:35.06]Look at this.
[05:36.18]When I graze by an enemy, watch what happens.
[05:39.27]It goes out of control right by him.
[05:48.22]Come on.
[05:49.46]You don't want to aim at the ground.
[05:51.06]You want to aim at me.
[05:51.98]I'm up in the window.
[05:52.86]Can you see me?
[05:54.02]Yeah, I'm up in the window.
[05:54.78]There you go.
[05:55.73]No, no, no.
[05:56.15]Not to the right.
[05:56.91]Up in the window.
[05:58.18]Ooh, you got me!
[05:59.38]Ooh!
[06:00.94]I bet you a thousand dollars they don't kill me.
[06:04.72]I bet you a thousand dollars I can walk right up to these crates and be completely fine.
[06:10.49]Let's see.
[06:12.84]Yep, I'm almost at the crates.
[06:14.80]Hmm, they're getting a little more accurate.
[06:17.22]I made it to the crates, and I'm completely un... Oh, you're... You just got scared.
[06:24.26]Sure.
[06:25.46]Sure thing.
[06:27.12]Sure thing, yeah.
[06:28.72]Good.
[06:29.94]Good.
[06:31.06]Good.
[06:32.61]Good.
[06:32.97]Go back to the kick technique.
[06:37.63]Why am I missing him?
[06:38.73]What the fuck am I missing him for?
[06:41.58]How am I missing him with a wrench?
[06:45.05]I'm hitting these guys with a wrench and it's not even touching them.
[06:48.65]I'm done.
[06:51.97]If somebody you know owns this game...
[06:54.86]Go to their house, get them a cup of coffee, brew them some tea, get them a nice warm blanket, wrap it around them and tell them you're sorry.
[07:03.14]Say, man, I know you spent like 20 bucks on that game.
[07:07.74]I'm really sorry.
[07:08.88]Here's some tea and here's a blanket to keep yourself warm because you're probably cold on the inside from playing this game.
[07:16.57]Thank you all so much for watching.
[07:17.75]I really do appreciate it.
[07:18.73]See you all next time.
[07:21.39]Take care, everybody.
