[00:01.63]This is gonna sound weird, but do you ever sit down in your chair or in your car and you know nothing has been changed?
[00:11.82]You know that you haven't moved the seat, you know that you haven't changed where the wheel is or where your mouse is or where your armrests are, but it doesn't feel correct.
[00:22.42]It feels like somebody changed everything about this seat and this has been the same way for probably eight and a half months.
[00:29.60]It's freaking me out.
[00:30.66]It feels like the armrests are too high.
[00:32.39]I didn't do anything.
[00:37.73]It's weird.
[00:40.47]Maybe I should go up a little?
[00:42.74]I'm gonna go up.
[00:44.02]Let's see if this helps.
[00:46.10]And now when you adjust to try to get it the way that you want it, the way that you remember it, you'll never get it the same way again.
[00:55.91]He's getting shorter.
[00:56.81]No, I'm saying, like, I need to be up higher.
[00:59.77]Doesn't matter how long your legs are.
[01:02.07]Guys, everybody that goes and gets their hair cut, they pump, pump, pump, pump, they pump you up in that chair.
[01:08.78]You could be 6'5".
[01:11.36]Don't matter.
[01:16.91]Anyways, welcome everybody.
[01:18.95]Welcome back.
[01:22.13]Time to get scared.
[01:24.41]It is going to be a continuation of Darkwood for as long as I can tolerate it, I guess.
[01:40.08]Should be fun.
[01:41.12]I'm enjoying it so far.
[01:42.82]That might change over the next five to seven hours.
[01:45.90]I don't know.
[01:47.70]He's just tolerating it.
[01:49.32]Tolerating implies you don't like doing it.
[01:52.97]Well, I'm talking about scariness and stress.
[01:59.91]It's not that I'm tolerating the game.
[02:02.57]I'm tolerating what happens when you play a game like this.
[02:07.69]You get stressed.
[02:08.93]You get jumpy.
[02:15.48]It's not too scary.
[02:18.35]So tolerating the game.
[02:19.25]No, the game is good.
[02:20.43]It's just, alright, if somebody screams in your face, there's only so many times somebody can scream in your face before you're like, alright, I can't do that anymore.
[02:30.64]That person could be an amazing juggler, and they're doing an incredible juggling, and it's the best juggling act you've ever seen.
[02:37.60]But every four or five minutes, they just lean over and they scream directly in your face.
[02:44.09]You're gonna be like, this is a great juggling act, but he screams a lot, doesn't he?
[02:54.60]Anyways, hopefully this... I have to turn my webcam on.
[02:59.22]how do I turn off the whole stream because I think I was not I didn't have any clothes on when I was doing this last so and sometimes this webcam takes a frame of the last thing that I did before I turn off the cam on obs so there's I have no shirt on for this and I'm certain of it so I need to like turn it on without you seeing how do I I think I can do it like this
[03:25.21]I think.
[03:25.61]I hope this works.
[03:27.03]Please work.
[03:28.43]Don't, like, come up and... Hold on.
[03:30.01]I need to see where this is.
[03:30.79]Alright.
[03:33.37]I almost just did it.
[03:34.33]Thank God I moved it.
[03:38.07]Okay.
[03:41.10]So now, this should be fine.
[03:42.94]Because I just turned it on and turned it off.
[03:45.12]Like, twice.
[03:49.74]Don't be fucking naked.
[03:50.60]Don't be naked.
[03:51.18]Don't be naked.
[03:51.72]Don't be naked.
[03:52.26]Don't be naked.
[03:54.54]Don't be naked.
[04:01.64]Yes.
[04:04.75]We're good.
[04:06.97]We're good.
[04:07.49]I look a little tired today.
[04:08.63]It's because I had a bad dream last night.
[04:12.63]And anytime you have a bad dream, it's like you hadn't slept at all.
[04:18.45]Alright.
[04:19.47]Let's make sure that's all set.
[04:23.58]It's a story time?
[04:24.70]No, this is not a story time dream.
[04:27.73]This is just scary and horrible.
[04:31.77]It's like somebody broke into the house.
[04:36.23]And I was like hiding around a corner.
[04:39.91]And they were like going through everything and breaking stuff and trying to attack everybody.
[04:44.97]And I'm just like, what the fuck do I do?
[04:46.65]What the fuck do I do?
[04:47.83]And I grabbed... This is gonna sound crazy.
[04:50.65]I don't know why this was here.
[04:52.03]But I grabbed...
[04:53.92]A music stand.
[04:57.38]A music stand.
[04:59.10]The thing that you put the, you know, like the notes on.
[05:04.36]I don't know why that was in my house.
[05:06.32]And I had this music stand.
[05:07.81]I was like, I'm gonna fucking bash this guy's head in.
[05:10.83]And then I woke up.
[05:12.15]I mean, it was just terrifying.
[05:19.73]It's because I'm playing this.
[05:20.83]Guys, this is why I don't play.
[05:22.19]I'm playing a scary game.
[05:25.26]That's why I had this dream.
[05:26.64]Okay, makes sense.
[05:30.68]But that was the only thing that was around.
[05:32.34]It was... That was it.
[05:33.92]I had to use it.
[05:35.78]It's the game.
[05:36.82]Alright, let's go.
[05:37.38]Uh, if you don't know, this is obviously Starkwood.
[05:41.46]Played about six hours of it last night.
[05:48.67]You gotta be careful when coffee's filled to the brim.
[05:51.69]And I did it this time.
[05:52.87]It was me.
[05:55.70]I talked a lot of shit about this, and I did it.
[05:57.66]But here's the difference, though.
[06:01.95]It's open.
[06:08.45]It's different when you do it to yourself.
[06:10.95]You know what I mean?
[06:13.36]When somebody else does it, you can slide it.
[06:16.80]Alright, let's go.
[06:17.32]Is the webcam too big?
[06:18.90]I don't know.
[06:20.64]I spilled on my shirt?
[06:21.60]No, I didn't.
[06:23.41]We're on day 11.
[06:23.91]Alright, I gotta get ready.
[06:25.95]I can stall as long as I want.
[06:36.66]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[06:38.64]It's because I know what's about to happen.
[06:39.96]I have to concentrate and it's hard.
[06:42.27]Somebody just said to go to the spa?
[06:52.85]Alright, I'm ready.
[06:56.97]Nice hair.
[06:58.49]I know, everyone talks about my hair.
[07:01.77]One day I'll have the best hair on Twitch and nobody will be able to make fun of me.
[07:05.29]Ever again.
[07:05.77]Alright, let's go.
[07:07.47]This is 758 Chapter 1, Day 11.
[07:11.27]Difficulty... pretty hard.
[07:14.32]Why did I... I just saw the only thing that was a color and I just almost clicked it.
[07:18.96]Alright, both headphones going in.
[07:20.26]I'm going in.
[07:22.57]You're playing a challenging and unforgiving game.
[07:24.47]You'll not be led by the hand.
[07:25.89]Respect the woods.
[07:26.67]Be patient and focus.
[07:32.73]Yeah, I'm going in.
[07:33.55]This is two headphones.
[07:34.39]Horror movies have two headphones.
[07:40.62]It's called normal.
[07:42.72]No, but it's not, though, because the game told me that it was very hard to begin with.
[07:49.22]So it's already on hard.
[07:51.44]The other two difficulties are just harder and hardest.
[07:54.52]Hard, harder, hardest.
[08:05.44]Alright, that's good.
[08:08.38]So we got to the second shelter.
[08:11.91]Lost inventory.
[08:12.51]Oh, I died in here.
[08:13.33]Right.
[08:13.57]That's the last thing that happened.
[08:14.53]Somebody told me to put the bathtub up in the corner.
[08:16.71]It turned out to be incredibly incorrect.
[08:21.57]Where's my... Where's my backpack?
[08:26.02]There it is.
[08:26.36]Alright, so now I've got time.
[08:30.58]What I was going to do today, for those of you who have no idea what this game is, this is Darkwood.
[08:34.58]It's a game about surviving in a haunted, scary forest, and you have to go to different hideouts, and I'm at Hideout 2.
[08:43.14]And it's scary, and it's hard.
[08:44.54]It's a very hard game.
[08:46.53]So...
[08:48.37]You're going to see me probably lose a few times, but it's because it's hard, not because I'm bad at the game.
[08:56.81]You know when you go to the toy store, and there's those things that, you know, like...
[09:08.37]I have to annoy everybody as soon as possible.
[09:11.23]That's what I have to do on this stream.
[09:13.23]Alright, so... The time is frozen right now, so I can... Where's the... No, we're here.
[09:21.46]No, that's good.
[09:23.32]He's just doing the same stream.
[09:25.40]No, it's a callback.
[09:26.16]Alright, I got a lockpick.
[09:29.73]I have to rearrange this.
[09:31.11]I hate this already.
[09:31.95]What did I do?
[09:32.49]Gas on the bottom.
[09:33.17]Gas on the bottom.
[09:35.31]Gas on the bottom.
[09:38.46]Oh, this is so annoying.
[09:44.92]What a mess.
[09:46.22]And there was wood up here.
[09:49.91]Torch is technically made out of wood, but it's going to go in my inventory.
[09:52.29]Shiny stone is technically a metal.
[09:54.25]Well, it's kind of a metal.
[09:56.53]Wood is going to go here.
[10:01.32]Wood and rocks will go here.
[10:06.03]Um, let me put this down here.
[10:09.03]Well, wood.
[10:09.49]There it is.
[10:10.23]Wood, wood.
[10:12.59]Consumables.
[10:15.19]Uh, recycling would go this way.
[10:17.91]Yeah, this is like recycling and just shit that is like miscellaneous.
[10:25.19]Drugs and alcohol go up on top of here.
[10:27.63]I can only have three stacks?
[10:30.64]Why?
[10:30.72]Um...
[10:35.33]He's still streaming this.
[10:36.51]Yeah, I haven't stopped since yesterday.
[10:38.09]That's why I look a little tired.
[10:39.97]I'm just so into it.
[10:40.71]I'm, like, wicked addicted to it.
[10:43.69]It's just really fun.
[10:44.67]I just haven't stopped.
[10:47.87]And I didn't put that emote.
[10:50.33]The Germasaur emote wasn't there at stream start yesterday, so here you are.
[10:53.92]I've only got, like, another six hours of this shit before it's over.
[10:57.18]24 hours.
[10:57.38]Alright, weapons are gonna go up top.
[11:02.94]This is technically wood.
[11:06.97]I don't know why that wasn't just part of the stack in the first place.
[11:08.79]Alright, so drugs, alcohol, fire.
[11:15.94]Drugs.
[11:17.90]Okay.
[11:19.12]No, keep that together.
[11:20.62]Shovel is gonna go... Okay, fan belt is just miscellaneous, but I don't know... Guns, weapons are gonna go up top, because that's obviously important, right?
[11:31.73]I still need to be able to make that.
[11:34.37]The small caliber magazine is for the gun.
[11:38.89]craft the shovel oh I need tape and I can I can do this right now tape alright does this guy have tape you got tape right well how much money do I have he's got tape this is awesome alright I can make I can actually make the shovel
[12:12.12]I do need to upgrade my workshop to craft this.
[12:14.06]What are you talking about?
[12:19.68]I need to upgrade my work to... What?
[12:21.78]Why?
[12:22.02]I need to upgrade my workshop.
[12:27.84]I need another... Didn't I just do this?
[12:29.46]I need another toolbox.
[12:33.48]Okay, well, shovel materials are going up here.
[12:35.72]I need the stick.
[12:37.47]This will eventually make shovel.
[12:40.70]I need five toolboxes.
[12:42.96]That would be horrible if that were true.
[12:47.14]Torch.
[12:47.82]I gotta repair this.
[12:49.64]Do I have enough?
[12:50.32]I need five needles.
[12:56.35]It's like you pay for a service, right?
[12:59.83]I paid for the guy who was supposed to deliver my shit here.
[13:02.91]And he just threw it on a bag.
[13:04.39]I had it all alphabetical order.
[13:06.27]And he just threw it on the bag and just dropped it in front of my house.
[13:08.54]Because I have to do this again now.
[13:13.53]Alright, fan belt is probably gonna be just miscellaneous.
[13:16.55]Tire would be miscellaneous.
[13:17.72]Battery electronics go up here.
[13:19.34]Alright, this is okay.
[13:24.60]Shiny stone is not electronics.
[13:25.80]I'm just gonna sell it.
[13:27.56]This is miscellaneous too.
[13:31.02]Alright, this looks alright.
[13:32.64]I'm okay with this.
[13:36.30]Weapons.
[13:37.80]Fire.
[13:38.72]Consumables.
[13:44.19]The tire, I could put that up there too.
[13:46.55]This is alright.
[13:50.16]Now, I need to board up a bunch of these windows.
[13:54.52]That was what I was going to do last time before extreme fatigue put in after playing this game for six hours.
[14:01.81]Now that I'm fresh, I'm awoken.
[14:04.43]Almost just spilled the coffee completely on my lap.
[14:09.73]We're organized.
[14:13.56]Is this my first time playing Darkwood?
[14:14.82]Yes.
[14:16.16]I've started it yesterday.
[14:18.46]This is the second time I've ever technically sat down to play it.
[14:22.76]Alright, let's go.
[14:26.78]I need some needles.
[14:29.61]How many traps do I have?
[14:31.97]Bear trap.
[14:32.91]How many windows do we got?
[14:34.55]What does it take?
[14:36.05]I need three wood and seven needles.
[14:39.71]I'm gonna have to go back on a wood hunt.
[14:42.09]Where's that thing?
[14:42.77]I can do this.
[14:43.57]I got some wood here.
[14:46.13]How many is this gonna make?
[14:50.43]Wait and get the needles first before he leaves.
[14:52.81]How many does he have?
[14:56.08]Nail.
[14:56.46]I just gotta get a bunch of them.
[14:58.66]I have to do this.
[14:59.38]I need it.
[14:59.72]Just give me all of them.
[15:07.04]He's late.
[15:10.00]I've been streaming for 15 minutes.
[15:13.82]He's late.
[15:14.42]Alright, uh, the generator's still on.
[15:21.59]No, it's not.
[15:23.43]It is.
[15:24.09]God damn it.
[15:27.93]Let's make some planks.
[15:32.13]So I got, like, 20 of these now.
[15:38.68]Still frozen time, that's good.
[15:40.06]Alright.
[15:43.44]I need to get all these boarded up.
[15:45.96]But, I need to repair this... Alright, let me think about this for a second.
[15:51.27]Now, don't build a bathtub.
[15:53.39]So, this is... I can't do anything about this.
[15:55.41]So, they're always going to get into here.
[15:57.01]Right?
[15:57.73]So, if they're always going to get into there, that means I have to take care of... I have to get one spot that I know I'm going to stay in.
[16:02.79]Where are the lamps?
[16:03.79]Where are the lamps?
[16:06.37]I'm not building a bathtub.
[16:08.49]Okay, there's... This looks alright.
[16:12.27]I don't mind this spot, but then I have to deal with this.
[16:15.63]What about the bedroom?
[16:18.02]This is alright too, but there's two entryways.
[16:22.92]And then there's in this room, and there's only... Yeah, okay.
[16:26.78]This is the room.
[16:27.72]Right here.
[16:29.10]This one.
[16:31.34]Let's go for it.
[16:37.85]Alright, that's boarded up.
[16:40.59]I can go around here, board this one up too.
[16:45.44]I will have two rooms to play with here, because then I just have to worry about the up top here.
[16:51.50]Oh, there's bread in here, nice.
[16:53.88]Because I could care less if they get in up here, I just don't want them to get in here.
[16:57.65]Or here, that means to trap it up.
[17:00.43]Let's drag this table.
[17:03.19]I came prepared today, guys.
[17:04.41]You thought I was going to be a clown today?
[17:06.50]No.
[17:09.58]Not today.
[17:15.92]Itchy eye.
[17:16.14]What is that?
[17:28.38]Why even drag the table?
[17:30.56]This is so much easier to do it like this.
[17:35.42]Just push it.
[17:37.90]Alright, so that will block off... Will it block this whole thing?
[17:40.94]It will not.
[17:43.52]So I need to be aware of that.
[17:45.34]We gotta have table here.
[17:46.46]There's a sofa.
[17:48.68]Let's move the sofa.
[17:51.93]I'm thinking... Maybe a bathtub.
[17:58.95]Because then this is good.
[18:00.77]I'm thinking bathtub right back here too.
[18:02.79]Alright, let's make a bathtub.
[18:12.10]I'm not going to say it.
[18:18.31]I just want it to be a mess over here.
[18:22.28]How am I going to get in?
[18:25.40]I will have it so I can move it in a particular way.
[18:27.94]Very, very small.
[18:28.98]Like a puzzle.
[18:32.15]So if you see a puzzle for the first time, you don't know the solution to the puzzle.
[18:35.94]But if you made the puzzle, if you created the puzzle, you just turn that table 14 degrees clockwise and I get in.
[18:45.72]I am the puzzle maker, not the puzzle taker.
[18:50.20]So, for instance, like, it could just be as simple as, like, drag this up.
[18:52.90]Like this.
[18:53.96]Done.
[18:54.30]Puzzle's complete.
[18:55.66]And then I make it through here.
[18:57.47]And then I just pull it back down.
[18:58.97]I don't know.
[18:59.75]Something like that.
[19:00.29]Alright.
[19:00.75]Uh, I got two boarded windows.
[19:01.57]I need my traps.
[19:03.45]How many do I have?
[19:05.45]Zero.
[19:05.73]I need to make them.
[19:09.06]I need to get a door.
[19:15.42]I can't... What do you mean?
[19:16.62]I can't make it?
[19:17.20]Can you make a door?
[19:25.53]Can I take the door off from here?
[19:29.29]I'll barricade this door.
[19:32.39]I need more needles.
[19:33.65]What?
[19:40.11]Alright, this also has to come into the other room.
[19:43.25]I gotta get this in here.
[19:44.97]This is where I'm gonna get ready.
[19:50.12]The time is frozen right now, so I got all as much time as I need.
[19:58.81]We're gonna do this the way that I should have done it in the first place, and that's just walk into it.
[20:08.24]I don't, you know, it doesn't need to, I can, I can do the puzzle maker after.
[20:10.76]Let's pull it through.
[20:15.54]I gotta get this set up, it's important.
[20:20.38]If I, I could survive a night here, and that's the plan.
[20:27.04]Boarded windows, put traps along.
[20:28.82]I'm going to put traps here too.
[20:32.33]I'll be ready.
[20:32.73]Alright, there's one lamp.
[20:34.73]Where's the other ones?
[20:35.55]There's one in here.
[20:36.57]That's fine.
[20:37.61]Get it away from the windows though.
[20:38.89]I remember that message from last night.
[20:41.49]That's get this away from the windows.
[20:45.33]Because the light will shine through.
[20:46.75]So we're not going to put it near the windows.
[20:53.12]Okay, we're going to put this in the corner.
[20:57.18]I need a good lamp placement.
[21:00.21]So it doesn't shine completely through these windows.
[21:02.25]I'm going to save this corner up here.
[21:03.53]And I'll block it with a sofa.
[21:05.07]Sounds good.
[21:13.16]Right there.
[21:13.62]Should be alright.
[21:14.40]I got one there.
[21:15.10]I got one here.
[21:18.02]Maybe a little bit into this.
[21:19.50]Maybe up here a little.
[21:21.18]Still shining through a little bit.
[21:24.87]I think it's alright.
[21:26.35]What about the... Um, I think that's fine.
[21:29.60]That should be okay.
[21:31.38]Two lamps and a bathtub, they have no chance.
[21:34.46]I also have this, too.
[21:35.82]Can I move this?
[21:37.84]I can't drag the table.
[21:41.18]Whatever.
[21:41.62]Alright, I need to make traps.
[21:43.69]I need more nails, which I don't have.
[21:47.93]Alright, where do I get nails?
[21:50.63]No, don't repair the doorway.
[21:53.61]Where do you get nails?
[22:02.85]At the hardware store.
[22:03.95]I'm talking about... Yeah, okay.
[22:07.66]I have six.
[22:10.32]I bought the whole store worth of nails.
[22:14.16]Uh... Really should repair the door.
[22:19.29]I need another nail.
[22:20.17]I don't have any.
[22:21.83]I have to just kind of explore and look for some nails.
[22:25.15]And wood, too, because I'm out of that.
[22:27.61]Or am I?
[22:30.44]That was kind of a waste of money, but it's okay.
[22:34.45]Alright, I need to repair my board.
[22:39.69]Game is quiet.
[22:41.21]Oh, shit.
[22:41.79]Hold on.
[22:42.37]I'll fix that.
[22:45.39]Game's quiet.
[22:51.28]Hey, there you go.
[22:56.44]Alright.
[22:57.86]Still haven't spent any time.
[22:59.06]I need to repair this.
[23:03.47]Let's repair it.
[23:04.13]I should have enough, right?
[23:05.15]I do.
[23:05.31]Alright.
[23:07.67]Crude weapon.
[23:08.61]I've got some gasoline that I'm gonna just store.
[23:11.29]I don't need it right now.
[23:15.05]Get rid of these boards.
[23:19.53]Okay.
[23:21.63]I'll keep the bread on me.
[23:22.65]I'll keep the torch on me.
[23:23.55]Keep the lockpick.
[23:24.39]Get rid of the scrap metal.
[23:29.63]I could sell the shiny stone.
[23:30.66]Yeah, let's do that.
[23:31.94]Might as well.
[23:35.87]I heard something.
[23:37.57]If you take too long, does, like, the Bubble Bobble Ghost come and get you if you take too long here?
[23:43.37]Can somebody confirm that with me, please?
[23:49.38]No, yes.
[23:53.72]Alright, well... I think I'm fine.
[24:06.42]Alright, time to go look for wood.
[24:07.54]I am in the Silent Forest, so might as well look for wood.
[24:10.67]I have to get wood and nails, or I'm guaranteed to lose.
[24:14.89]So, if I go off on a tangent here, talking about keyboards, if I bring up the dream I had last night, I want you to spam jermaSour in the chat.
[24:25.84]Because I cannot mess around tonight.
[24:28.08]I have to go do this right now.
[24:30.90]Do not let me talk about anything else besides, did I collect wood or did I collect nails?
[24:42.75]Alright.
[24:43.27]I'm going to go up to the camp because there was still stuff up there that I needed to get.
[24:48.09]And... Block pick bread.
[24:53.59]Alright.
[24:54.35]Okay.
[24:55.15]I don't need this gasoline here.
[24:56.11]It's wasting inventory space.
[25:01.67]How do you do jermaSour?
[25:02.75]Well, you gotta be a subscriber to the channel.
[25:05.35]Tier 1.
[25:05.61]And then you do Jerma, lowercase, and then uppercase S, and then lowercase hour.
[25:11.94]But switch the O and the U, so it's your.
[25:14.70]But if you say, you know what I mean.
[25:16.07]You'll figure it out.
[25:17.47]Alright, uh, what was I doing?
[25:19.15]Gasoline.
[25:19.59]I got plenty of gas, so this is fine.
[25:22.11]Alright, I'm ready.
[25:24.83]Wait!
[25:28.02]I also need a bunch of scrap metal, too, because I'm going to make a shitload of these.
[25:30.24]Alright, I'm ready.
[25:30.74]Let's go.
[25:31.46]Up to the camp.
[25:32.36]I've got my board.
[25:32.96]I remember how to play.
[25:36.24]Maybe.
[25:37.22]That's kind of it.
[25:38.62]I don't think that's actually true.
[25:40.66]And we found wood automatically right up here.
[25:42.97]Oh my god.
[25:44.29]Thank goodness.
[25:47.31]Only one pile?
[25:48.57]Come on.
[25:49.25]Make it easy for me.
[25:51.15]It took me 40 minutes when I played yesterday to figure out where the hell this stuff was in the first place.
[25:57.76]Why is it so dark?
[25:59.30]It's 8 a.m.
[26:01.32]Alright, this camp had some stuff.
[26:04.32]Yeah, there's some rocks here.
[26:05.48]I remember I was freaking out and everyone was telling me, just go, just go, you can come back, you can come back.
[26:11.24]So I can come back, I'm fine.
[26:13.96]There's a stick here.
[26:16.52]I might just turn it around immediately and just dump the stuff back in the stash.
[26:23.41]Oh, nice.
[26:24.59]Absolutely beautiful.
[26:31.00]Someone's walking around.
[26:31.72]Alright, I'm going to... Let's deposit it right now.
[26:45.95]Whoa!
[26:46.53]Okay.
[26:47.23]It's just a... It's a rock thrower.
[26:48.73]That's a... The guy throws rocks.
[26:54.08]Come on, throw a rock.
[26:56.18]Throw.
[26:57.84]That was a pretty good dodge if you ask me.
[27:05.13]Wait, he doesn't just... Wait, what?
[27:07.08]I thought he just threw rocks.
[27:07.96]I just got baited.
[27:15.22]I thought he just threw rocks.
[27:17.85]Okay, I got a deposit.
[27:19.65]It's only been one hour.
[27:26.30]This is good.
[27:26.70]Is this my house?
[27:28.72]Yeah, right?
[27:29.48]It is.
[27:31.45]Alright, get rid of this stuff right now.
[27:32.63]So we got a... Rock, staff, bottle, rag.
[27:37.31]I don't have any healing potions.
[27:40.71]I don't have any healing potion drenched gauze.
[27:44.91]Meat, match, wire.
[27:46.25]Okay.
[27:47.11]I need to make some bandages because I don't have any.
[27:50.45]I have two of the big ones, but I'm not going to use those.
[27:53.33]That would be a mistake.
[27:55.23]Take your shirt off.
[27:57.95]I unironically banned that person for five minutes.
[28:11.07]How do you unironically ban somebody?
[28:14.09]Don't you just ban somebody?
[28:22.30]Alright, hold on.
[28:24.24]I got... I just want to have bandages with me.
[28:30.68]Yes, we're good.
[28:31.76]I'll keep the bread too.
[28:32.65]Alright, back out.
[28:33.73]Nails.
[28:34.05]Deposit the nails just in case I die.
[28:35.71]Nails.
[28:36.19]What if I lose?
[28:38.83]Alright.
[28:39.67]And this thing's almost broken.
[28:42.94]Alright, back out.
[28:44.32]I want to explore to the left, because there's a wolf's camp.
[28:46.48]There's a... Pyotrek's house is over this way, and there's probably lots of wood and stuff to collect.
[28:54.04]There's a fucking battery in here.
[28:56.43]What the heck?
[28:58.31]Okay.
[29:00.93]I also have a gun.
[29:01.71]I need to get... Remember, if you see a toolbox, spam GermaToolbox in the chat.
[29:06.79]That's my new emote.
[29:23.28]Guy right there.
[29:29.61]Ice.
[29:29.83]I have to take it.
[29:40.00]Of course I do.
[29:45.02]I couldn't see it.
[29:51.04]There he is.
[29:51.92]Alright, alright.
[29:52.46]Is he throwing rocks or what?
[29:54.10]Is this a rock person?
[29:58.06]I can't tell.
[29:58.50]I think it's a rock person.
[29:59.50]Yep.
[30:00.36]I stepped in the poison mushrooms again.
[30:05.20]Oh my!
[30:08.28]They blend in really well here.
[30:13.17]They blend in so well.
[30:14.43]This is bad.
[30:21.63]silo there's a plague doctor here
[30:53.45]I've said it before and I'll say it again.
[30:54.51]There are only two people that listen to classical music like this.
[30:59.57]That's the dentist and serial killers.
[31:36.94]No, I can't turn this off because it's gonna be like, who turned off my gramophone?
[31:44.60]I'll endure it for now.
[31:53.05]Ooh.
[31:57.10]That's what happens when you do stuff like this.
[31:58.98]There's a bed over here.
[32:24.43]Oh, shit.
[32:25.19]Okay, hold on.
[32:27.76]There's a chest.
[32:32.06]Something good.
[32:32.76]Something really good.
[32:35.76]Dead rat.
[32:38.92]Why would I have... That's the first time I've seen that.
[32:41.06]Dead rat?
[32:45.18]Check the other side.
[32:45.80]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[33:03.93]I guess it's just playing.
[33:04.99]I can't turn it off.
[33:11.73]Okay, maybe I'll come back here later.
[33:12.91]Alright.
[33:13.61]Wood and sticks.
[33:16.17]Nothing else.
[33:20.37]Right?
[33:22.37]Wood and nails.
[33:23.97]Nothing else.
[33:24.43]Wood and nails.
[33:25.91]Alright, come on.
[33:29.69]Break it.
[33:31.03]Wood and nails!
[33:33.56]Wood and nails.
[33:35.11]I'm supposed to be getting wood and nails.
[33:40.33]What am I breaking?
[33:42.09]Break what?
[33:45.15]What am I breaking?
[33:47.67]Smash it.
[33:48.37]Smash the gramophone.
[33:53.90]You guys are supposed to keep me on the wood and nails only run.
[34:02.32]An hour has gone by.
[34:07.74]I can only hit something like two or three more times before this is broken.
[34:11.38]Keep that in mind.
[34:12.02]Alright, what's this?
[34:15.51]Corp?
[34:19.31]Chicken head.
[34:21.03]Bear trap.
[34:21.79]Nice.
[34:22.41]Alcohol in a bottle.
[34:24.15]I'm out of room.
[34:25.81]I might have to go back, but I need nails.
[34:30.48]Bad.
[34:31.18]Really badly.
[34:34.32]Can I burn this?
[34:44.52]Damn it.
[34:45.78]I have to go back at like 15 and figure out... Tank wreck.
[34:57.52]Tank?
[34:59.34]He's got me nails in here.
[35:01.96]Right?
[35:05.40]No, this is the silo.
[35:16.41]What is this?
[35:18.69]How many are there?
[35:19.21]Can I throw a bottle at his head?
[35:25.94]Wait a minute.
[35:35.88]I just did.
[35:37.78]Oh, this is not good.
[35:39.10]There's something over here, though.
[35:40.08]This...
[35:53.34]Kill him!
[35:53.70]Kill him!
[35:54.37]You do it!
[35:55.31]You do it!
[35:57.71]Get him!
[35:59.25]Help me, please!
[36:02.81]Kill that guy!
[36:05.63]Somebody, please!
[36:08.51]Alright, one's dead.
[36:09.82]I'm trying to line it up.
[36:12.52]Good.
[36:13.54]Okay, now I gotta go.
[36:16.60]I gotta- I have to go.
[36:17.15]I gotta go.

[36:17.81]I gotta go.
[36:18.13]It's gonna come for- I got- Tank wreck.
[36:19.99]A wreck of a World War II tank.
[36:26.24]That's it?
[36:37.83]Knife.
[36:38.46]Don't put the watch away.
[36:39.70]Gasoline.
[36:40.12]Don't need it.
[36:40.54]Fabric.
[36:42.64]Throw away the stones.
[36:44.08]I don't know who carries fabric.
[36:46.14]Battery.
[36:46.74]Gasoline.
[36:49.84]Eat the bread.
[36:52.26]Take the battery.
[36:53.79]And then... Get rid of the rag.
[36:57.83]No.
[36:58.17]Just make something.
[37:00.25]Throw away the dead rats.
[37:01.59]Do I need them?
[37:05.55]Sure, I don't need them.
[37:10.82]Keep them.
[37:11.78]It's a dead rat.
[37:13.02]I know, but what if I need them?
[37:14.52]There might be some recipe.
[37:16.24]I don't need the gasoline.
[37:16.98]I'm fine.
[37:17.32]Okay, I have a knife now.
[37:20.43]But, okay, where is that beast?
[37:23.93]I gotta look at what you have on you.
[37:25.39]Just a stick.
[37:25.97]Who cares?
[37:26.45]I want that alcohol.
[37:29.31]Bottle.
[37:29.79]I can take it.
[37:30.83]Okay.
[37:31.41]Hold on.
[37:33.75]Rag.
[37:34.09]Stick.
[37:34.37]Stick.
[37:41.45]Who cares?
[37:41.79]Okay, um... I need to go back.
[37:48.54]What do I have?
[37:49.08]I have... No, where's the wolf?
[37:52.06]I gotta go to wolf camp and buy, uh... And buy nails.
[37:59.31]No, that's far.
[37:59.85]How far away is that?
[38:07.13]That might be too far away.
[38:14.93]16.
[38:15.21]I need enough time to get back.
[38:17.89]I'm gonna go for it.
[38:37.10]Okay, I have to leave.
[38:40.40]I have to leave right now.
[38:42.96]Bear traps in this game is like dig... You cannot run in a straight line in this game.
[38:46.25]It's like digging down in Minecraft.
[38:48.47]I have to go back.
[38:49.71]I have to deal with it.
[38:57.88]I need a pile of wood.
[38:58.96]I need nails.
[39:02.72]I might be able to survive.
[39:05.37]It's possible.
[39:10.35]I just have to really get boarded up and get ready and stab somebody with a knife.
[39:23.06]Let me see what I can do here.
[39:27.76]Boarded.
[39:29.12]This is open, but it's okay.
[39:30.22]They're going to come through here anyways.
[39:32.28]Alright, let me deposit the mushrooms.
[39:33.51]I still have about... I have two hours or so to figure this out.
[39:40.24]So we've got 40 essence.
[39:42.16]40 essence.
[39:42.62]Nice.
[39:42.88]Not bad.
[39:46.76]Okay, here we go.

[39:58.61]Keeper bandages.
[39:59.43]Actually, no!
[40:01.27]Wait, I don't have a well here.
[40:03.43]Wait!
[40:03.81]Just stay next to a light source.
[40:04.85]Okay, cool.
[40:05.41]Cool.
[40:10.51]Lantern!
[40:15.39]Should I do this?
[40:19.11]Invent... okay.
[40:25.78]Inventory upgrade.
[40:28.36]I know I'm doing that one.
[40:30.94]Okay.
[40:32.22]Now I want to do bear trap.
[40:37.09]Bear... I don't have any boogers.
[40:38.01]Stop.

[40:40.03]I need... I want four bear traps.
[40:45.06]Make a bandage.
[40:53.14]Alright.
[40:54.82]I still have alcohol.
[40:55.68]Store it.
[40:56.06]Alright.
[40:59.83]Get rid of the wood, too.
[41:00.79]Alright, now I gotta... I can do this later.
[41:02.85]Repair this.
[41:05.83]I just... It's... To be used as a melee weapon, a throne.
[41:10.62]I'm gonna have to just use the knife and get rid of the bottles.
[41:15.76]Okay, set these up.
[41:17.46]Cook the rats.
[41:19.80]Cook the rats?
[41:21.96]Are you serious?
[41:24.31]Alright, chicken head, rats.
[41:36.04]You guys wanted me to throw those away.
[41:41.09]Wow.
[41:41.53]Imagine if I threw those away, how much of a mistake that would be.
[41:44.51]Holy God.
[41:47.89]Okay.
[41:48.81]I think that's enough.
[41:49.73]I have a bandage.
[41:51.73]I have to stand next to electricity light.
[41:54.10]I'm gonna go for it.
[41:55.06]Okay, let's do it.
[41:58.24]So, I need to turn the generator on.
[42:00.82]Now.
[42:04.14]Generator on.
[42:09.20]Boink.
[42:12.04]Get back over here.
[42:17.90]This is where we have to figure this out.
[42:19.34]Alright, now... I need to survive in these two rooms.
[42:24.55]Bear trap.
[42:25.61]Right here.
[42:25.99]Okay.
[42:36.70]Bear trap here, bear trap there.
[42:45.20]Hurry up.
[42:50.50]Good.
[42:53.64]Alright.
[42:54.28]In here too?
[42:55.56]I need... Why is this wall glowing?
[42:58.77]Okay.
[43:02.25]Bear trap here.
[43:04.29]I'm gonna... You know what?
[43:05.19]No.
[43:05.61]No, no.
[43:06.09]Bear trap.
[43:11.09]I don't know.
[43:11.45]It's gonna have to be like right here.
[43:14.17]Yeah, I have to hang out in this room.
[43:16.59]There's going to be a bear trap here.
[43:18.31]First of all... Ah, I'm running out of time.
[43:20.33]Running out of time.
[43:20.79]There's no more time left.
[43:22.64]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:24.68]Get the bathtub and the... Hurry up.
[43:26.62]Drag the table.
[43:29.64]No, long ways.
[43:30.72]I have 30 minutes.
[44:11.19]Light.
[44:11.53]This is a light source.
[44:12.34]Why am I not being healed?
[44:14.38]This is not an electricity light source?
[44:16.41]What?
[44:18.55]Why?
[44:47.25]This is in case somebody gets in here, and this is in case somebody gets in this way.
[44:50.53]They're boarded though.
[44:55.33]A little bit of light's bleeding through, but I think it's okay.
[44:59.95]They're in the house right now.
[45:01.58]Okay.
[45:02.28]He's in the house!
[45:02.96]He's in the house right now!
[45:04.36]He didn't get... Step on the trap!
[45:06.68]Don't... Why is he not getting stuck on the traps?
[45:10.68]Somebody explain that to me!
[45:12.48]Why is he not getting stuck on the traps?
[45:15.08]He's avoiding all of them.
[45:28.99]Wait, what?
[45:29.57]My knife!
[45:30.81]Huh?
[45:31.89]Heal.
[45:40.67]The trap was underneath the sofa!
[45:48.36]Oh fuck, he's coming in.
[45:50.12]Give me the scrap.
[45:51.28]I don't know what to do.
[45:51.96]He didn't even step on any of them.
[46:11.00]Reinforce.
[46:14.72]I'm just gonna go like this and just put white here so he can't open it.
[46:17.61]You know what I mean?
[46:19.55]Like he can't push me over.
[46:48.98]uh they're gonna turn the light off wait did they get are they gonna get a double don't turn the lights off both of them no I can't take a sip of my coffee yet
[47:44.09]We're good.
[47:45.73]I did it.
[47:48.71]Something else has to go here.
[47:50.11]This has to be traps.
[47:52.05]Furniture is useless.
[47:58.88]What?
[48:00.62]6 a.m.
[48:00.82]Come on.
[48:06.49]Oh, God.
[48:07.33]Oh, God damn it.
[48:10.55]Give me a torch.
[48:19.40]Get out of here.
[48:21.46]Back!
[48:32.94]Press Q to use Moth.
[48:34.52]Oh.
[48:35.04]I'm good.
[48:37.85]Furniture is absolutely useless.
[48:39.35]Getting rid of all of this, and we're gonna do, like, three traps here.
[48:42.89]Made it.
[48:44.89]Another night.
[48:53.34]They just walk into the traps.
[48:55.30]Can I pick these up?
[48:57.04]Disarm.
[48:57.50]I'm going to leave them there, though.
[48:58.76]These are okay.
[48:59.30]I actually don't mind these where they are.
[49:00.47]I don't have to go in this room for any reason.
[49:04.85]I'm fine.
[49:06.35]That was a stress gas that came up.
[49:12.77]Okay, searched this already.
[49:14.27]Let's go back.
[49:16.01]Nails.
[49:16.41]You got nails for me.
[49:17.43]Yes, you do.
[49:17.99]I know you do.
[49:21.81]But do I want them?
[49:27.34]I mean, yes, I kind of do.
[49:28.48]I kind of need them.
[49:36.76]Give me all of them.
[49:39.65]All these... I'll take the mushroom, too.
[49:43.71]You know what?
[49:44.39]No, that's a waste.
[49:46.47]Gotta go find one.
[49:48.21]And I've already got tape for the shovel, but I need the toolbox.
[49:52.13]I need to go back to the wolf.
[49:55.43]I'm gonna refill everything.
[50:01.46]Okay, let's check this out now.
[50:03.54]Now that I have a minute.
[50:04.78]I might come back and buy the scrap, too.
[50:08.08]Because I need it for the traps.
[50:09.43]In fact, I'm just gonna get it now.
[50:12.07]Because I know I'm gonna need it.
[50:15.67]Let us do a fun little thing here called... Board up the remaining windows.
[50:21.18]Or repair door.
[50:22.32]You know, this is not a bad idea.
[50:27.14]But first, the furniture is stupid.
[50:31.76]I don't even know why I have a bathtub.
[50:36.33]It doesn't do anything for me.
[50:42.25]Bathtub just gets in the way.
[50:44.33]And I wasted stuff on this.
[50:47.28]Alright.
[50:48.70]Chair can go over here, because it just causes a problem.
[50:54.23]So I got one in front of the window.
[50:55.53]I want one, two, three here.
[50:58.54]Can I make them?
[51:00.24]I think so.
[51:03.30]Back to the workshop for a second.
[51:07.34]I don't have any to cook.
[51:08.02]No.
[51:08.50]I almost have another level up, though.
[51:12.52]Alright.
[51:13.35]Bear trap.
[51:15.47]Three, six, nine, twelve.
[51:16.77]I can make four of these.
[51:18.11]One.
[51:20.69]Two.
[51:22.87]Three.
[51:23.15]Four.
[51:27.82]Turn off the generator.
[51:28.86]Thank you.
[51:30.97]Thank you for reminding me about the generator.
[51:33.37]Appreciate it.
[51:44.97]Okay, what do I put in here?
[52:02.90]This is a way better place to defend.
[52:16.74]There's a hole in that wall.
[52:19.90]I can repair that.
[52:22.36]I can reinforce this door.
[52:24.37]A wooden door.
[52:26.66]No.
[52:27.58]I can't.
[52:29.56]But only one trap has to go here.
[52:36.00]Check this out.
[52:36.96]Yeah, okay.
[52:38.25]There's only one point of entry here.
[52:43.93]I'm gonna try it.
[52:45.79]Whatever.
[52:46.13]If it's wrong, it's wrong.
[52:47.15]If it's wrong, it's wrong.
[52:49.07]It's smaller.
[52:49.69]It's less places to get in.
[52:53.85]I'm gonna dismantle all the stuff that I've done.
[52:57.41]No, it's too late.
[52:58.07]I already have this set up.
[53:00.45]No, this is alright.
[53:01.23]It really is just this one point of entry right here.
[53:02.91]And that, potentially.
[53:04.13]Whatever that is.
[53:05.25]Why are you guys counting up?
[53:10.73]46, 40.
[53:10.97]What are you doing?
[53:14.79]If I dismantle this trap, can I pick it up?
[53:17.73]Or does it turn into scrap?
[53:19.27]I need to find out.
[53:19.85]I need to learn on my own.
[53:35.72]It's alright.
[53:36.69]But is it the same amount of scrap?
[53:38.87]I need to learn on my own.
[53:39.75]I have to make mistakes.
[53:41.37]Two scrap metal.
[53:42.73]What does it cost to make one?
[53:43.95]Two or three?
[53:46.05]It's half of what it is.
[53:47.07]Alright, so I'm gonna... Shit.
[53:49.65]Okay, that's fine.
[53:50.33]Whatever.
[53:50.65]Don't worry.
[53:53.77]I gotta make my mistakes.
[53:56.73]Let's see how this plays out.
[54:01.15]In here.
[54:02.95]Got this one spot.
[54:04.77]The barricade.
[54:05.57]I don't have any... How do I not have any logs?
[54:08.99]What the hell are you talking about?
[54:13.49]Why?
[54:13.61]What are you guys doing?
[54:15.95]Why are you guys counting up?
[54:16.95]Why?
[54:17.13]What's with the counting?
[54:19.15]What happened?
[54:21.54]I don't understand why this is happening.
[54:29.30]Um, alright, wood.
[54:31.22]Wooden planks.
[54:32.30]Wooden planks.
[54:34.36]Uh, wood.
[54:35.48]Any more wooden planks in here?
[54:36.92]I'm gonna take the gasoline and dump it.
[54:41.30]I'm gonna make another bear trap.
[54:44.77]Alright, one, two, three, five bear traps.
[54:51.23]I can make another weapon.
[54:52.91]No, why would I do that?
[54:54.89]Make a bandage again.
[54:58.46]Okay.
[55:00.08]Got two lockpicks.
[55:01.67]Pretty sick.
[55:03.49]I got a mushroom.
[55:04.45]Let's deposit that.
[55:10.74]You guys aren't gonna make me put this in subscriber-only mode, are you?
[55:30.05]It'll get worse.
[55:32.65]Don't make me use that power.
[55:36.70]Okay, wait, you have mushrooms for sale, don't you?
[55:39.46]What if I'm lazy?
[55:40.44]I'm lazy.
[55:42.44]Let's level up.
[55:56.49]Uh, okay.
[56:00.05]My... My blood will hurt enemies.
[56:08.12]Once a day for about a minute, I will be able to see all around me.
[56:15.66]Once a day, I'll be able to run for a short amount of time without losing stamina.
[56:22.71]My vulnerability to poison increases.
[56:24.31]My sight will get worse for a short amount of time when I receive damage.
[56:27.15]That's not good.
[56:29.76]This is also not good, because I step in these every time.
[56:38.59]I don't know what's the right call here.
[56:44.83]I kind of like this.
[56:49.54]When I take damage, I don't know what that means.
[56:54.70]I step in poison mushrooms every time they're around, so I don't know how much worse that's gonna be.
[57:05.61]Runner is really good.
[57:09.45]Does that just randomly happen?
[57:15.46]So randomly, I just, it turns on a superpower.
[57:24.05]Ooh, that's actually... Okay, if I can activate that, that's really good.
[57:28.95]I like that, because then I can just sprint away from anything.
[57:31.35]I got... Yeah, that's this one.
[57:32.99]Um... Just don't step in the poison mushrooms, Jeremy.
[57:42.66]Seriously.
[57:44.30]Just don't.
[57:57.28]You fucked it.
[58:00.60]I'm gonna be fine.
[58:04.26]I have heals.
[58:04.70]Yeah, I got heals.
[58:17.41]More of this... shine... It's the goose game.
[58:22.42]The sound still resonates inside this mossy bell.
[58:32.93]It's a sword.
[58:33.95]It's a sword castle.
[58:54.52]I want them to think I'm stupid.
[58:56.98]Alright, so we've got... Come on in, get in line.
[59:07.75]I want them to think I'm stupid.
[59:14.32]I want that person to not be able to talk for the next eight minutes.
[59:18.28]I want that person to not be able to talk for one of the eight deadly sins.
[59:22.02]Greed.
[59:22.86]Gluttony.
[59:23.68]Lust.
[59:28.77]Wrath.
[59:38.85]Wait, what the fuck?
[59:39.73]How is he doing that?
[59:41.61]How the fuck is he... He's pulling its thumb off!
[59:45.25]Whoa!
[59:48.73]Dude, whoa!
[59:52.26]Pride, as you just saw.
[60:01.84]Greed, gluttony, pride, lust, wrath, sloth.
[60:06.47]Greed, gluttony, pride, lust, sloth.
[60:12.51]Wrath.
[60:17.89]Was that a... Greed?
[60:21.57]I've done this before.
[60:22.51]Yes, I've done this before.
[60:23.99]I remember this.
[60:24.59]I remember trying to do the Seven Deadly Sins.
[60:28.32]Envy!
[60:28.74]There it is.
[60:29.74]Right.
[60:34.62]What if I don't touch it?
[60:46.35]Just repair the doorway in my dream.
[60:53.07]Kent, you see there's a line?
[60:54.93]Where the hell are you going?
[60:55.99]Alright, fine.
[61:01.20]I don't know the code. 3333.
[61:27.25]Was it already on it?
[61:29.61]Was it 666?
[61:30.21]Oh, it was already on it.
[61:33.19]Uh, never mind.
[61:46.26]Lockpick?
[61:46.86]Can I just lockpick?
[61:50.52]Do I have to, like, get in line and, like, listen to them talk?
[62:01.90]No, don't barricade the door.
[62:03.66]Open it with a lockpick.
[62:11.86]Ooh, an axe.
[62:14.38]And a strange box.
[62:17.40]It's covered in scratches.
[62:18.78]Okay.
[62:21.98]I only have a weapon now.
[62:49.13]You suck.
[62:52.05]It's a scripted event guys, that's a script.
[62:57.01]No, I don't suck.
[62:58.85]I don't suck at reading a script.
[63:02.17]What did I just do that for?
[63:03.49]I thought this was my inventory.
[63:05.11]I was like, yeah, I don't know, guys.
[63:07.43]That sucks.
[63:08.15]I'm just buying everything.
[63:09.11]Okay, what was I... I was in the middle of doing something.
[63:21.28]Oh, wait, it's the wolfman.
[63:24.34]I'll be damned.
[63:25.28]I barely believe my beautiful eyes.
[63:27.71]You made it.
[63:28.55]I need to admit you're quite a resourceful piece of meat.
[63:31.99]Time to get to the specifics.
[63:33.21]Follow the path located in the southern edge of the Silent Forest.
[63:36.16]You'll get to a village where you'll find a hag who reeks of chickens.
[63:39.62]Talk to her.
[63:40.44]Maybe you'll learn something interesting.
[63:43.34]Be on your guard, comrade.
[63:44.40]Don't let her deceive you with that kind of face of hers.
[63:47.14]This selfish bitch is keeping something that does not belong to her behind the locked door in her house.
[63:52.32]Something I'm after.
[63:53.20]Bring me the key to that door and I'll tell you where to find the thing you lost.
[63:57.30]Is this fair, comrade?
[63:58.22]A key for a key.
[64:00.52]Heh, good.
[64:01.36]Now take off, get to work.
[64:06.92]Oh, it's one of these!
[64:07.70]The wolf grabs the box and starts sniffing it from every angle.
[64:10.63]I could swear I've heard this tail moving under his coat.
[64:24.74]interesting find me guess now you want to know what's inside.
[64:27.83]Somewhere in the northwestern part of the old woods lies a place where you'll find a key to this box.
[64:34.87]Northwestern part of the old woods.
[64:37.97]Well, I would be careful if I were you trust me, you don't want to open it by yourself.
[64:41.89]Bring me the key and don't try to be a wise guy.
[64:44.45]You won't know what to do with it.
[64:49.61]Okay.
[64:51.50]Looks like no one else will enlighten you.
[64:52.80]Listen, the inhabitants of our lovely village hold many, many secrets.
[64:56.26]Treasures they do not wish to share with anyone.
[64:59.11]Those selfish, deceitful wretches, they think they're superior because they have human gobs.
[65:05.23]They treat us like lepers.
[65:06.99]But you know what?
[65:08.29]Fuck them.
[65:09.13]We're buddies, aren't we?
[65:10.63]And them, they deserve to be punished, meat.
[65:14.24]The wolf moves closer to me.
[65:16.94]Hear that squealing?
[65:18.38]It's one of their secrets.
[65:20.56]The wolf grins, listening to the distant sound with great relish.
[65:25.20]Find that pigshed, meat.
[65:26.90]Make that squealing stop and the treasure will be yours.
[65:36.62]Oh, you motherfucker.
[65:40.90]Hold on.
[65:42.94]I need that toolbox.
[65:46.28]Stay here, don't leave.
[65:49.52]Do not leave.
[65:51.71]I've got to do something with you.
[65:53.99]Hold on.
[65:56.75]He likes weapons.
[65:57.55]Alright, what about a staff?
[66:05.88]Meat.
[66:08.64]I shouldn't get rid of the gun, right?
[66:10.00]It's a handgun.
[66:10.48]It's worth a lot.
[66:16.16]I have 37 matchsticks.
[66:17.52]Sell the shiny stone.
[66:18.93]Oh, shit.
[66:19.39]I didn't even know I had one.
[66:21.03]What's that doing in the consumable, in the alcohol category?
[66:24.69]What is that going to put me on?
[66:28.83]Flare, maybe?
[66:31.80]I'm not going to use these flares.
[66:32.82]You know that.
[66:33.68]I'm not going to use them.
[66:34.82]I'm certain.
[66:36.96]What's with the big eyes?
[66:37.86]Scared?
[66:38.38]Bad dream.
[66:39.34]The wolf winks at me, baring his teeth slightly.
[66:45.35]I need 200.
[66:47.61]So, I'll give you a flare.
[66:48.83]60, 70, 80, 95.
[66:51.89]And then I want $5 for this staff.
[66:54.85]Good.
[66:56.63]Give me that toolbox.
[66:59.23]Done deal.
[67:06.88]Upgrade the workbench.
[67:08.06]Let's go.
[67:15.07]Shovel.
[67:16.51]New melee weapon.
[67:17.29]I can get rid of this stupid board with nails in it.
[67:21.15]Finally.
[67:25.47]There it is.
[67:28.20]Thank God.
[67:31.44]Upgrade item two.
[67:32.72]What can I do with this?
[67:33.62]Light materials.
[67:35.84]Attacks use less stamina.
[67:38.38]Inflict more damage.
[67:40.96]Increased durability.
[67:42.10]I like that.
[67:42.62]It's a dirty base.
[67:44.34]Greatly increased weapon durability.
[67:46.58]I need another spade head.
[67:50.61]I would say probably this one.
[67:52.83]Weapon durability.
[67:56.97]Sharpened shovel.
[67:57.87]That would be interesting.
[68:00.71]What was I going to do?
[68:05.98]I don't remember.
[68:06.88]Is it an emergency weapon?
[68:10.05]Repair item.
[68:11.15]No, we don't need that anymore.
[68:12.25]Alright, torch.
[68:14.61]What are these bottles for?
[68:15.93]I guess I could just throw them around and put glass everywhere, right?
[68:19.62]That's not a bad idea.
[68:20.38]Alright, I'm gonna have a bunch of glass.
[68:24.58]Because what the hell am I gonna use this shit for anyways?
[68:26.50]Alright, I need those boards.
[68:30.89]I need nails.
[68:32.47]Where are my nails?
[68:32.97]There we go.
[68:34.47]I'm gonna go turn this wood into more boards.
[68:48.22]14.
[68:48.36]How many do I need?
[68:50.16]What does it take to barricade a window?
[68:51.50]3.
[68:52.56]Alright, let's check this out.
[68:56.29]I can make a door here, but let's get the windows first.
[69:00.29]7.
[69:00.67]I can only do this 3 times.
[69:02.47]Does he have nails?
[69:03.07]Does the wolf have nails?
[69:04.83]I didn't even check.
[69:14.45]He does.
[69:15.61]Oh, shh.
[69:16.17]God damn it.
[69:17.17]I need all of these.
[69:18.33]Take another flare.
[69:20.05]And... Are we going to Red Lobster?
[69:40.03]Red Lobster?
[69:40.79]No.
[69:41.49]No.
[69:44.32]Alright, let's board these... No.
[69:54.43]What if I just don't give a shit and just board this up?
[69:57.97]I could barricade... No, that's a bad idea.
[70:01.29]I have to make it secure.
[70:03.35]This is the entryway.
[70:04.63]Let's board up this.
[70:11.16]I'm gonna have to do them all.
[70:17.15]I actually don't mind sitting in this corner.
[70:19.17]Oh no.
[70:23.89]I didn't see that.
[70:24.91]This room is not good.
[70:44.42]Lobsters aren't even real.
[70:54.81]This is alright.
[70:55.43]So they can only come in through here.
[71:01.40]I actually don't like lobster very much.
[71:03.12]I like crab.
[71:03.84]I prefer crab to lobster.
[71:06.14]There's a potato in here.
[71:08.38]Alright, so the only one that needs to be boarded is this one.
[71:13.95]And then I have the door there.
[71:16.65]So this needs... I need some more wood and a couple more nails.
[71:20.79]I can buy that from any of these two people in the house.
[71:25.06]Let's go in my stash.
[71:30.72]Chicken head.
[71:36.00]I'm getting rid of these matchsticks.
[71:38.02]I don't have anything else that's worth anything.
[71:42.13]I just need a little bit more.
[71:48.62]The batteries are worth a lot.
[71:50.70]But... I feel like I'm gonna need them eventually.
[71:53.62]For something.
[71:54.34]Light armor?
[71:55.52]A potato?
[72:03.38]Oh, no.
[72:04.85]Okay.
[72:07.27]So that wouldn't work?
[72:13.99]I'm just gonna sell the potato.
[72:16.31]And...
[72:19.03]Sell the potatoes, sell the meat.
[72:23.86]And... And one battery.
[72:29.06]That should last me, I think.
[72:32.44]I have to.
[72:33.19]Who has the stuff I need?
[72:36.15]I know you have wood, so I'm gonna take... I'm just gonna buy ten wood from you.
[72:43.30]And...
[72:45.58]A couple of wires, too.
[72:46.86]Just one wire.
[72:47.54]Um... Yeah.
[72:51.82]Okay.
[72:52.26]Yeah.
[72:53.94]Yeah.
[72:56.40]He's compulsively buying things.
[72:58.05]I need to do this, though.
[72:58.93]Otherwise I'm just dead.
[73:00.19]Alright, here's a potato.
[73:02.53]A battery.
[73:05.33]A piece of meat.
[73:11.02]And... That's good, right?
[73:13.24]Because then I need to buy... What am I buying from you?
[73:16.91]What was I doing?
[73:17.43]Why did I do this?
[73:18.71]For nails, right?
[73:19.51]Okay, nails.
[73:20.03]So that I don't have to give you the battery.
[73:25.25]No, I can keep the potato.
[73:28.43]And the meat.
[73:32.05]Alright.
[73:35.54]What's this, like, up-down thing I'm seeing?
[73:40.14]Now that lets me barricade this window...
[73:46.35]I want to bring that.
[73:48.19]Store this.
[73:49.61]I have the glass bottles because I want to break them.
[73:55.07]Let's make another lockpick.
[73:59.82]I have... I only have one bandage.
[74:01.92]I have a couple of these good ones, though.
[74:03.24]You know what?
[74:05.26]No.
[74:06.38]No, not worth it.
[74:07.28]Put these back.
[74:08.18]Put the potato back.
[74:09.08]Get the boards.
[74:14.33]Let's do it.
[74:19.22]He's the traitor.
[74:20.14]What?
[74:22.38]Okay.
[74:23.24]This is an open window.
[74:24.44]This needs to be boarded.
[74:30.12]Boarded.
[74:31.06]Boarded?
[74:33.25]All the windows are boarded.
[74:36.11]Now I'm thinking board up this and just be in here.
[74:42.65]And then... I think that's a good idea.
[74:49.83]So, I guess it's... Why did I... Why did I board these up?
[75:00.04]Just in case.
[75:00.54]I don't know.
[75:07.48]What about the lights?
[75:10.06]Oh, right.
[75:11.36]I could put a light in the corner over here.
[75:13.34]And then the other one can just hang out, like, up there.
[75:19.78]And I'm gonna board this up, too, when it becomes nighttime.
[75:29.71]I can't do anything about this.
[75:32.49]No, unfortunately.
[75:34.59]Can I drag this?
[75:39.89]No.
[75:40.23]Oh, I can drag this, though.
[75:41.51]Alright.
[75:43.67]At least block up this thing.
[75:47.15]You now have one of the best melee weapons in the game, the shovel.
[75:50.53]Oh, I know.
[75:50.93]That's why I built it.
[75:53.01]It was worth it.
[75:59.83]Let's spin this.
[76:00.63]Can I spin this around?
[76:02.51]This ain't going to do anything, but at least it'll be annoying.
[76:07.61]It'll at least be irritating for somebody for a second.
[76:11.17]Alright, now let's put some glass on the ground in here.
[76:24.64]Okay.
[76:27.62]And then... So now I just... Uh, yeah.
[76:32.40]Right?
[76:32.78]And then... Sprinkle it here?
[76:35.25]Right there?
[76:37.45]Like, right here.
[76:38.25]Yeah?
[76:39.83]Yeah.
[76:40.83]Alright.
[76:43.37]Good.
[76:43.83]Don't step in it.
[76:44.78]I'm gonna put some more here, too.
[76:47.48]Just in... I don't know.
[76:48.20]Just in case somebody, you know, comes in here.
[76:54.88]He's gonna step on it.
[76:56.00]I don't think I'm gonna step on it for one reason, because I am not really gonna come down in this room unless I absolutely have to.
[77:02.44]At least that's the theory.
[77:10.95]So glass is not a trap, it just hurts.
[77:13.47]Right?
[77:16.91]Okay.
[77:17.65]Board this up.
[77:18.91]Do I have enough to do it?
[77:20.25]I do.
[77:22.23]Do it!
[77:25.99]Ain't anybody getting through that.
[77:29.40]Bear trap.
[77:31.54]Put the sofa down there.
[77:36.04]No, put the sofa up here.
[77:38.92]No, no, no, no, no.
[77:39.52]I have to get everything in here, too.
[77:40.58]I have to get the lights in here.
[77:44.49]Where's the light?
[77:44.97]I'm going to get the light right now.
[77:45.83]Okay.
[77:55.33]Should I just get one?
[77:56.27]No, the ghosts turn off one.
[77:58.75]Hurry, time has stopped right now, I've got plenty of time.
[78:11.38]It's seriously faster if I just do it like this.
[78:16.50]And the bathtub too, just so people can stop saying the word bathtub.
[78:37.79]This is so far.
[78:38.57]Uh-oh, here comes the Bubble Bobble Ghost.
[78:42.75]Here it comes!
[78:47.16]Were you actually serious?
[78:49.18]No, okay, that new ground I'm dragging over.
[78:51.76]Get this in here.
[79:25.61]Alright, good.
[79:27.13]Now, let's get the other one.
[79:34.38]Ice hockey?
[79:34.92]Well, that would be more like curling.
[79:52.37]The curling is lame.
[79:56.84]It's alright, it's cool.
[80:06.12]It's currently in the game with the brums, where the guys just go feverishly like brum brum brum brum brum brum brum, right?
[80:13.62]That's kind of cool.
[80:23.09]Alright, we can almost be done with this.
[80:24.57]And I don't have to go far to turn the generator off either.
[80:34.13]Can I make these eventually?
[80:35.53]Because it's annoying to have to drag them around the whole damn house.
[80:38.03]This is almost as boring as this stream.
[80:45.43]What's that person's name?
[81:11.52]Sorry, what's that?
[81:12.26]I couldn't hear you over me enjoying the video game.
[81:14.54]What's that?
[81:14.92]I couldn't hear it.
[81:16.26]What'd you say?
[81:16.60]Is somebody up?
[81:27.51]What?
[81:38.44]straight down alright I'm ready to lock this down which I don't have to do right now tell me his name so in theory this is boarded sofa goes up here at night
[82:01.64]Traps go down.
[82:03.40]Well, I'll have enough time to do that.
[82:04.60]I have them in my inventory.
[82:05.82]I might as well just do them now.
[82:07.88]At least a couple of them.
[82:09.84]Where I know I'm going to put them.
[82:12.04]So, I mean, this is very obvious.
[82:13.48]This has to go in the corner.
[82:17.19]I'm setting up my Animal Crossing house!
[82:27.53]Okay.
[82:28.49]Let me do it.
[82:31.02]I'm trying to survive here!
[82:32.18]Maybe right in the middle.
[82:36.67]I don't hate that.
[82:38.57]But if they turn it off... No, there's light going through there.
[82:41.11]What about over here?
[82:43.25]Just to both corners?
[82:44.23]Yeah, right in front of the door.
[82:45.83]That's fine.
[82:48.51]Play Animal Crossing OST.
[82:50.41]I'm not going to play Animal Crossing OST.
[82:52.15]Alright.
[82:53.71]Bear trap.
[82:54.77]In front of this window.
[82:57.27]Just don't step in it.
[83:01.04]And then eventually I'm going to have one right there and one right there.
[83:03.84]You can't see because I'm pointing at the screen.
[83:06.60]One right there, one right there.
[83:08.78]When I come in for the night.
[83:16.39]We want Animal Crossing.
[83:17.73]The Animal Crossing OST is not going to make any sense in about three minutes.
[83:23.21]So, I thought I stepped on a trap.
[83:27.63]Same thing with this one right here.
[83:35.09]Both.
[83:35.49]That is good.
[83:36.19]That's good.
[83:37.23]One more here.
[83:37.99]And then I have two for the front door.
[83:42.19]I am ready to survive.
[83:43.53]I will live another day.
[83:47.19]Because now if they get through this one... Oh, what's that?
[83:51.19]Whoopsie.
[83:51.73]Oh.
[83:53.23]Where's the actual door?
[83:54.56]The actual door is right here.
[83:55.56]So I want it to be like right here.
[84:00.50]Right there.
[84:05.62]Alright.
[84:06.48]And then, at the end of the day, two here.
[84:10.68]I ain't dying, guys.
[84:11.74]I'm not going to lose this one.
[84:13.56]And I'm not going to move.
[84:16.02]So, let's get the couch in the right spot so I can just kind of push it over when it gets too late.
[84:21.12]Good!
[84:23.00]I'm ready.
[84:23.92]Let's go.
[84:24.44]What was I going to do?
[84:30.51]I don't know.
[84:30.95]It's open or not.
[84:31.73]I can do whatever I want.
[84:33.95]What was the thing that he said?
[84:39.99]The northwest of somewhere?
[84:42.37]Not here.
[84:42.83]Up here, probably.
[84:44.95]It's a pig.
[84:45.47]Yeah, the pigshed.
[84:48.43]Is the pigshed down here?
[84:51.89]Like, up this way?
[84:57.19]Pigshed.
[84:58.49]He's like, open that pigshed.
[85:00.05]Go to the pigshed.
[85:00.94]Chicken Lady is south of the Silent Forest.
[85:04.51]Oh, right.
[85:04.89]Okay, so I'm going to bring a chicken head to the chicken lady, right?
[85:08.25]That's me.
[85:09.85]Makes sense, doesn't it?
[85:12.87]Jerma did not go to the wedding.
[85:14.47]Oh, I didn't.
[85:15.11]You're right.
[85:15.39]I did not go to the wedding.
[85:17.65]Too many things to do.
[85:20.45]Alright, this is fine.
[85:21.28]Oh, I'm going to fill the gas up.
[85:25.16]I thought I didn't want to go to the wedding.
[85:26.34]It's just I forgot to go.
[85:27.52]Let's fill up the generator.
[85:30.76]Actually, fill this up with the gas.
[85:36.06]Okay.
[85:37.00]Might as well.
[85:37.54]This thing needs it.
[85:43.10]That's alright.
[85:43.60]Put the rest in here.
[85:45.94]Okay.
[85:53.89]Store the traps.
[85:55.63]And I'm ready for the adventure to begin.
[85:59.96]Put those bottles away.
[86:01.12]Bandage.
[86:01.64]Keep.
[86:02.12]Got that.
[86:03.04]Put the knife in the second slot.
[86:05.43]Bear trap can go away for now.
[86:07.87]Both bear traps can go away.
[86:09.31]Nice.
[86:09.81]Alright.
[86:10.29]Looking good.
[86:11.95]Looking good.
[86:14.79]Nails.
[86:15.43]So I got lockpick.
[86:16.31]Watch.
[86:16.91]Bandage.
[86:17.87]New weapon.
[86:18.51]Shovel.
[86:20.97]Bingo.
[86:23.40]I'm ready.
[86:24.78]We are gonna go left, and then we're gonna go to this person's house.
[86:28.26]Chicken head.
[86:29.14]Don't forget the chicken head.
[86:34.50]Where is it?
[86:35.22]Chicken head.
[86:35.68]We're going to the chicken lady's house, so.
[86:37.10]Alright, here we go.
[86:37.76]I'm going left and then down.
[86:42.77]I got the shovel now.
[86:43.59]Let's see.
[86:43.87]What does it do?
[86:45.29]Okay, it's like a stab.
[86:46.99]How long does this take?
[86:47.73]Okay, it's a big swing.
[86:51.70]This game looks pretty cool.
[86:52.54]The game is pretty cool.
[86:53.84]It is pretty cool.
[86:56.09]But, hold on.
[86:56.59]How do I do... Was it Q to do the thing?
[86:58.67]Is it set?
[86:59.83]How do I do this?
[87:01.91]You hold Q and then you click on one of the... Okay, I get it.
[87:05.49]Just wanted to know.
[87:07.67]So let's go down here to... Let's go to P.O.
[87:10.41]Trek's house.
[87:11.65]Or as far as we can get.
[87:12.57]Remember, we're collecting nails too.
[87:22.37]Use the UAV.
[87:24.77]Use your UAV.
[87:30.73]Chicken lady.
[87:34.23]Don't step on mushrooms.
[87:35.44]I have a negative now.
[87:37.60]Stepping on mushrooms means very bad things happen to me.
[87:43.54]There's a moose here somewhere.
[87:49.90]I don't even want it.
[87:52.41]I knew it.
[87:53.73]I told you it was right here.
[87:54.83]I'm not going to fight it.
[87:55.41]There's no reason to.
[87:59.67]Don't step on a mushroom.
[88:02.03]There's so many poison mushrooms.
[88:15.31]It's just a maze of poison mushrooms.
[88:16.77]I need to go down, not up.
[88:21.25]I don't have a torch.
[88:22.21]I didn't bring a torch.
[88:24.43]The one thing that I forgot to bring.
[88:27.37]Damn it.
[88:30.30]I was so ready for this, too.
[88:38.60]Where we at?
[88:39.36]Alright, we're at Piotrek's house.
[88:41.34]Got some barricades.
[88:51.31]But why?
[88:51.83]Somebody in there?
[89:18.50]I don't want to if I don't have to.
[89:22.09]Okay, I don't have to.
[89:23.23]Okay, I'm going in.
[89:35.68]Junk pile.
[89:36.42]A pile of junk sloppily welded together.
[89:38.37]Yeah, this is somebody's base.
[89:53.56]Uh-oh.
[89:56.92]Tractor ain't gonna stop me from coming in.
[89:58.46]There's a heavy smell of gasoline in the air.
[90:03.22]This is once a tractor, now it's a hollow, rusty body.
[90:05.40]All of its useful mechanical parts have been scavenged.
[90:07.50]Except for this.
[90:12.59]Tractor wheel.
[90:13.67]Junk.
[90:16.35]Crate.
[90:22.00]Alcohol, match, gasoline.
[90:27.47]Nobody in here.
[90:28.71]I need... I need fire.
[90:36.07]I can't get through here without fire, and I didn't bring... What about the matchstick?
[90:41.02]Can I throw matches on it?
[90:46.00]Can I light a match?
[90:48.20]Oh, yeah, I can.
[91:02.96]Not strong enough.
[91:06.36]Alcohol and match.
[91:10.06]Throw alcohol, and then throw match.
[91:20.40]There's gas in here, and I'm like, yeah, whatever.
[91:24.60]I'm just gonna throw matches.
[91:26.28]I didn't even realize that.
[91:30.10]Yeah, you're right.
[91:30.91]That would be really dumb.
[91:41.18]Well, I'm going to need to throw a Molotov in here.
[91:44.40]Remember this exists.
[91:47.76]Pour gasoline on the gunk.
[91:49.02]Alright, I have an idea.
[91:57.47]Does this work?
[92:34.45]I thought there was gas in the air.
[92:39.97]Hey!
[92:44.43]Hey!
[92:44.79]Hey!
[92:45.19]Hey!
[92:45.59]Hey!
[93:05.41]Yeah!
[93:07.87]I didn't have to do that much.
[93:08.71]I don't know.
[93:09.87]It said there's a big smell of gasoline in the air.
[93:12.59]So, I don't know.
[93:13.31]I figured if there was a big fire, the whole building would explode.
[93:16.60]That's why I tried to go out and do, like, that GTA mission.
[93:19.24]Alright, I gotta be ready for this.
[93:22.24]Something's probably in here.
[93:28.48]No, it's just a chest.
[93:30.40]And some mushrooms.
[93:37.11]What's in the crate?
[93:37.69]Something worth it.
[93:42.59]Oh yeah.
[93:43.84]Oh yeah, that's worth it.
[93:45.66]Another toolbox.
[93:46.88]And a note.
[93:48.20]And... I cannot decipher any of this shit.
[93:53.06]So this is... a... wheel?
[93:56.44]A tire?
[93:57.12]A... toaster?
[93:58.61]A rocket ship.
[94:03.96]Well, they were breathing in gasoline this whole time they were drawing this, so... Take this whole thing with a grain of salt.
[94:13.78]Alright, well, I got the toolbox.
[94:14.94]That's good.
[94:16.30]Let's continue.
[94:23.48]Nothing else in here.
[94:24.18]Well, I'm, like, in this little compound area.
[94:31.72]This place looks like a scrap metal warehouse.
[94:33.46]The walls are covered with fungus and spider webs.
[94:35.27]It's very stuffy in here.
[94:39.93]I'm going to get reed.
[94:40.79]I know it.
[94:42.69]I'm going to go like this and put my hands up here.
[94:45.54]I don't know what kind of defense mechanism that's supposed to be, but I do it when I get scared every time.
[95:00.83]I smell... rosin.
[95:04.25]What the hell is a rosin?
[95:13.87]Batteries and tape.
[95:15.71]And then a postcard with a portrait of a man.
[95:17.43]Someone has pinned a caption on it.
[95:19.18]1961, the sky is dark and the Earth is blue.
[95:24.79]Nebo.
[95:26.53]Just cream... Oh, it's a different language.
[95:31.95]Okay.
[95:32.59]1961.
[95:32.61]With a dub.
[95:33.58]Okay.
[95:37.24]There's also stuff down here.
[95:38.70]Metal door.
[95:39.98]Prepare.
[95:43.16]There's a person right here.
[95:48.61]Oh, there's a person.
[95:50.43]I didn't hear you come in.
[95:52.37]The boy's eyes are wandering around the room.
[95:54.13]Wait, is this the courier?
[95:59.72]I found this wiggly metal thingy yesterday.
[96:01.94]It was laying there in the grass.
[96:04.20]I don't like grass.
[96:06.00]It's so slippery and it tickles your feet.
[96:08.22]Rather than grass, I would prefer these metal wigglies, yes.
[96:13.81]Okay.
[96:14.89]The metal antennas on his wiry hat suddenly start vibrating.
[96:18.97]Do you have any metal wigglies?
[96:21.43]Huh.
[96:23.94]Should I show them all the stuff?
[96:30.86]Oh, I have one too.
[96:31.90]It's such a beautiful photograph.
[96:35.14]I had one just like this.
[96:36.28]I melted it into a perfect little ball, shaped it like the moon.
[96:39.91]I melt everything plastic into moons.
[96:43.67]Piotrek suddenly becomes excited.
[96:46.17]And you have seen my vehicle?
[96:49.24]it's ready well almost ready just a couple of parts missing I will need to find them and I will have to repair the casing the one from this spring that fell off recently when I was entering the cockpit I hit my head and well it fell off I thought I was flying but it was just that lights went off oh this is your blueprint
[97:09.79]These are the blueprints for my space rocket.
[97:11.77]Almost ready.
[97:13.10]I broke down a whole tractor to build it.
[97:15.40]But I'm missing several parts.
[97:16.86]Several very important parts.
[97:19.02]For example, a shiny little mirror in this rectangular box with wires and... The boy suddenly becomes lost in thought.
[97:25.90]If only I had more tractors.
[97:28.76]I would definitely go to space.
[97:30.00]What can you tell me about the road?
[97:33.65]You won't be able to make it home via this road.
[97:35.63]You should build a rocket instead.
[97:38.77]What do you have?
[97:43.64]oh containers of gasoline of course I just inhale it all day I like electronic and mechanical thingies foods all sorts of stuff so you like food mechanical things batteries even one would say you like batteries oh you got nails
[98:13.11]I don't think... Oh.
[98:14.51]Here.
[98:19.66]He likes watches?
[98:21.52]I'll give you a battery.
[98:22.80]What's this?
[98:23.42]Cable.
[98:26.70]Does he have any, in particular, items that I... What did I just buy?
[98:29.92]Okay.
[98:33.65]You just stole his nails.
[98:34.85]No, I didn't.
[98:35.91]I had 50 reputation dollars.
[98:40.41]Flashlight.
[98:42.05]Military flashlight.
[98:43.33]And a regular flashlight.
[98:44.07]That's too much money.
[98:44.67]I'm gonna have to come back here with other stuff for you.
[98:49.44]You like electronic and mechanical thingies.
[98:55.08]And you have a toolbox, too.
[98:56.14]Alright, so... Okay.
[98:59.69]Good to know.
[99:00.73]What about gossip?
[99:02.41]I haven't slept a wink today.
[99:03.59]The whole night I thought about that large metal cover from the tractor.
[99:06.87]It's such a beautiful cover.
[99:08.76]Ideal cover, no doubt about that.
[99:10.44]I mean, almost, because I would need to bend it a bit with a screwdriver and it will shield me from the space dust that is.
[99:19.42]Suddenly becomes sad.
[99:21.68]Space dust.
[99:22.32]Space dust is everywhere.
[99:25.54]I like to watch the stars at night.
[99:26.96]Sometimes you can see these bright blinking spots.
[99:29.69]Those are spaceships and rockets, obviously.
[99:32.37]The sky is awfully boring during the day.
[99:34.63]No stars, no ships, no rockets, nothing.
[99:37.25]Only these white smoke trails.
[99:40.03]I saw one yesterday over there, far above the treetops.
[99:43.93]Dad used to say they were planes, but such long planes it would be crazy to fly them.
[99:57.10]Kidding.
[99:59.10]Well, I know you exist now.
[100:03.94]What's in your... Is it a bathroom?
[100:06.14]You got something over here.
[100:07.36]Hold on.
[100:13.42]It's getting kind of late.
[100:14.25]I should probably think about getting out of here.
[100:17.47]I could open it with a lockpick.
[100:19.47]Is he going to be mad about this?
[100:26.29]What do you got in here?
[100:31.09]Ooh.
[100:32.89]And two Molotov cocktails.
[100:40.90]Generator.
[100:41.62]Okay.
[100:45.16]How do I look for inventory space?
[100:46.94]I'm gonna have to think about heading back.
[100:51.29]I'll give it one more look.
[100:54.69]And then it's time to go back.
[101:01.21]I'm gonna go down.
[101:02.07]Where's this, um... This... Witch's hut, whatever it was.
[101:06.27]It's a chicken lady.
[101:10.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[101:14.45]Get out of here.
[101:16.99]Don't even... I just need one shot.
[101:24.95]Or two.
[101:28.45]This reach is amazing.
[101:29.73]I'm so glad I have this.
[101:34.21]And it's pretty durable, too.
[101:35.25]Alright, let's go down.
[101:40.86]At 15 or so, I gotta turn around.
[101:42.46]What the hell is that?
[102:01.75]Oh shit, there's two.
[102:04.73]Oh no, I gotta, okay.
[102:13.40]One more.
[102:13.72]Come here.
[102:15.00]You don't even know.
[102:16.88]And go.
[102:17.40]Alright.
[102:20.60]What do you got?
[102:24.80]Wires.
[102:25.36]Alcohol.
[102:32.83]Is somebody still banging?
[102:35.59]Who's banging?
[102:40.28]Who's banging right now?
[102:42.66]Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
[102:45.34]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:46.90]I gotta... Um... Get rid of the matches.
[102:52.93]Get rid of the matches.
[102:54.57]Get rid of the meat.
[102:56.55]Get rid of the... Uh, stones.
[102:59.99]Okay.
[103:00.09]Okay.
[103:14.24]And battery.
[103:29.91]Oh, it's this guy.
[103:30.70]Okay, he's hitting his head against a tree.
[103:31.86]Alright, I'm out.
[103:37.40]I'm out.
[103:37.66]I'm out.
[103:37.90]I'm out.
[103:38.18]I'm out.
[103:38.42]Time to go.
[103:40.95]Hey, once a day, once a day I can do this thing that is very useful right now, once a day,
[104:10.01]Hey!
[104:11.05]Oh!
[104:13.51]Okay.
[104:20.68]Go.
[104:33.58]Shit.
[104:33.94]I should've went at... What is it?
[104:35.04]I should've went at 15.
[104:35.72]Can I do it again?
[104:42.06]Alright, we're good.
[104:44.30]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[104:48.23]I got a lot of good stuff.
[104:51.17]Two.
[104:55.94]I'm fine, it's fine.
[104:56.64]Just go.
[104:59.10]He's pretty fast, though.
[104:59.94]He's fast.
[105:00.52]He's kind of fast.
[105:06.97]Where the fuck am I?
[105:08.15]Okay, I'm here.
[105:11.43]Where am I?
[105:11.95]This is not my house.
[105:12.97]Where's my house?
[105:16.73]Poison, your sight is... Where's my house?
[105:21.65]Oh, please, just... Go.
[105:36.15]I've... Okay, I've got to remember what I was going to do.
[105:43.02]This ain't my house.
[105:46.04]There it is.
[105:47.46]This wood right below my house?
[105:49.15]I didn't even know that.
[105:52.53]Fix this well, too.
[105:53.89]No, I can't.
[105:54.53]Not yet.
[105:56.33]Oh, my God.
[105:57.71]These were just down here the whole time.
[106:00.70]Forget it.
[106:01.12]Do it tomorrow.
[106:01.86]I have no time for this shit.
[106:11.86]One.
[106:12.36]Two.
[106:12.98]Three.
[106:13.30]Almost 800.
[106:13.58]Good.
[106:14.66]Good.
[106:15.56]Store this stuff.
[106:17.42]Bring out the traps.
[106:20.10]Store the fabric.
[106:21.32]The toolbox.
[106:22.04]The chicken head.
[106:23.78]The... Let's make... Make another bandage.
[106:30.12]Make a torch.
[106:31.62]Yeah.
[106:32.02]Yeah.
[106:32.64]Yeah.
[106:33.28]I'll make a couple torches.
[106:34.84]Because I'm going to need them.
[106:36.45]I think.
[106:38.12]Drugs.
[106:38.80]Molotov cocktail.
[106:39.64]Bullets.
[106:40.13]Wire.
[106:41.09]Just all this stuff.
[106:42.05]I can figure it out later.
[106:43.43]The nails.
[106:44.73]The machine gun.
[106:47.55]The other... I need more inventory space.
[106:52.50]Wait.
[106:53.96]I can have two clips.
[106:56.16]Gasoline.
[106:58.26]Okay.
[106:59.04]Now, what's this?
[107:00.28]Hotbar upgrade.
[107:03.28]I can't do this, though.
[107:05.28]I can't craft more items of this type, so I have to do a hotbar upgrade.
[107:13.45]Wait.
[107:14.25]What about the shovel?
[107:20.69]I'm running out of time!
[107:21.82]Okay.
[107:23.50]Just go, go, go, go, go, go.
[107:24.48]I need to repair this.
[107:26.94]Oh no, what?
[107:28.30]What does it take?
[107:29.44]What is that?
[107:30.50]What is that?
[107:31.26]What is that?
[107:32.19]Super scrap.
[107:32.91]Scrap?
[107:33.29]I don't have that.
[107:35.49]Okay, I'm in trouble.
[107:38.39]Give me the board.
[107:39.31]I don't want this to break.
[107:41.57]Um, I need- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[107:45.70]Out.
[107:46.08]Get out.
[107:52.28]I didn't take any traps.
[108:02.75]Where are the traps?
[108:38.31]I just put my face in it.
[108:48.69]I shouldn't have done that.
[108:49.91]That was a mistake.
[108:51.35]I can't move this over.
[108:52.33]Yeah, I can.
[109:07.19]There are traps fucking everywhere.
[109:17.35]Got it.
[109:18.11]Okay, we're good.
[109:20.19]Let's go.
[109:31.97]I... Electricity, once a day, argh!
[109:43.25]I'm surrounded.
[109:43.93]There's no gas in the generator?
[109:48.09]Yeah, there is.
[109:48.47]There's plenty.
[109:57.67]You can't step into one of those if you don't move.
[110:00.93]I mean, the theory is to just, like, kind of stand away from...
[110:07.15]How come they're not coming over here?
[110:08.39]I should have barricaded the door.
[110:09.51]That's right.
[110:10.33]You're right.
[110:10.71]I was going to do that.
[110:11.39]Remember I said I was going to do that?
[110:13.19]It's okay.
[110:13.55]I have to pee really bad too.
[110:17.05]I'm trying to hold it in as long as I can.
[110:23.12]No sign of anybody yet.
[110:28.02]Can I do it from right here?
[110:29.52]I can.
[110:31.72]No.
[110:32.06]Not doing it.
[110:34.30]I think that would be a waste.
[110:35.40]Because I'm already like almost at
[110:38.96]A good enough time, I think.
[110:40.88]Just do it now.
[110:42.22]I don't need to do it now.
[110:43.68]I got trapped right here.
[110:44.48]They're going to push the sofa out of the way, get stuck, and I'm going to kill them in one hit.
[110:56.33]Plus, I'm going to be banging on the wall?
[110:58.43]That's just asking somebody to come over here.
[111:00.89]No, it's good the way it is.
[111:10.32]Is that a gun?
[111:14.40]Somebody just shot a gun.
[111:28.56]You're gonna get headshot.
[111:31.16]There's no way.
[111:32.10]It hit the wood.
[111:43.11]Okay, get ready.
[111:48.92]He's in the... He's over there.
[111:51.79]He's in the other part of the house.
[112:15.79]Okay.
[112:16.43]There he is.
[112:16.95]There he is.
[112:17.47]He's coming over.
[112:21.89]How much health does he have?
[112:22.94]It's almost broken.
[112:23.58]It's almost broken.
[112:24.10]He's in.
[112:24.62]He got in.
[112:24.96]He's gonna get in.
[112:25.96]Got you.
[112:27.06]He's dead.
[112:29.42]Come to me.
[112:30.12]No.
[112:30.46]No, no, no, no, no.
[112:31.12]Don't come to you.
[112:31.92]I need to... Oh, no.
[112:33.30]Oh, no.
[112:34.84]Oh, no.
[112:36.22]Oh, no.
[112:37.06]It's open.
[112:46.47]Go to them.
[112:47.79]No!
[112:50.53]Rearm the trap.
[112:51.67]I don't have any more.
[112:52.29]I don't have any more.
[112:57.96]I gotta hit somebody in the head with...
[113:19.58]Thank you.
[114:06.34]Okay, I'm fine.
[114:08.02]I'm good Use the moth What's that?
[114:21.63]What's the red?
[114:22.17]Oh, right Day 13, this is the unlucky one
[114:39.22]Alright, now I've got some time.
[114:40.84]We live another day.
[114:47.66]This strategy worked out pretty well.
[114:49.40]But I'm going to board the door next time.
[114:51.78]That can stay.
[114:52.44]I need to re-board this.
[114:53.84]What do I need?
[114:54.40]I need wood.
[114:55.24]And it's all down there.
[114:56.28]Alright.
[114:56.58]I'm going to pee.
[114:58.63]I have to go to the bathroom now.
[115:00.67]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[115:02.49]Maybe more.
[115:02.97]Be right back.
[115:46.11]Thank you.
[116:13.31]Thank you.
[116:50.25]Thank you.
[117:39.83]I'm back.
[117:49.14]If Jerma reads this, I'll eat my sock.
[117:51.80]I wouldn't do that.
[117:55.00]How about this?
[117:57.37]Get yourself a water.
[117:59.19]At least eight ounces.
[118:02.26]How does that sound?
[118:14.75]He didn't read my message, thank God.
[118:17.85]What did you say?
[118:18.31]This wood logs here, too.
[118:22.07]So now, let's put this back in.
[118:28.24]Make sure I'm in the right place, which I should be.
[118:30.60]I gotta get a haircut, too.
[118:32.24]Eventually.
[118:32.70]Alright.
[118:37.37]This was a success.
[118:40.43]So much in fact that I'm gonna do it again.
[118:42.05]I got scrap metal.
[118:47.79]Okay, where's the glass?
[118:50.17]I feel like I can... Alright, first things first.
[118:56.64]This was untouched, so that's good.
[119:00.65]I'm gonna put some more gas in here.
[119:08.53]Hey!
[119:14.38]What?
[119:17.70]What's this shit?
[119:18.88]Why is this here?
[119:31.09]Why is there, like, corruption all over the place?
[119:33.03]Alright, you're good.
[119:44.48]Don't hit the traitor.
[119:45.46]I'm not gonna hit the traitor, I hope.
[119:49.58]Alright.
[119:52.52]Scrap metal weapon part.
[119:56.73]let me I got plenty of time so let me go to the workbench and see what this takes now I need to upgrade the workbench I need a gas canister I can make a hot bar upgrade which is probably for the best so I'm gonna do it what's it gonna give me another hot bar that's good it's just another slot I'm gonna repair the shovel
[120:26.40]And then I'm going to look at this again.
[120:27.64]Durability.
[120:31.57]I need eight scrap and I need a silencer tube.
[120:36.49]Scrap and a silencer.
[120:37.27]I want increased durability.
[120:38.81]Silencer tube.
[120:42.97]Yeah.
[120:46.50]You got one of those?
[120:48.40]You do.
[120:49.54]I will take that.
[120:50.28]How much scrap do you have?
[120:53.06]You got three.
[120:53.78]I'll take it all.
[120:56.10]hmm okay I how many block picks do I have two that's fine okay what do I need eight
[121:20.42]plenty of these alright I need to think about games like this is it's so hard to just point at the one thing that you want to do and do it you just get what about that and what about this what about this and what about that one wait I gotta get nails okay I gotta get nails but no way I gotta get there's a tire over there I have to get the tire and make the thing
[121:43.90]But that makes it fun.
[121:45.88]I really like it.
[121:46.48]Make the camera bigger.
[121:48.27]Is this a one-guy scenario where I'm going to one-guy this?
[121:57.27]No, that's a good spot.
[121:58.31]In fact, it's still too bright.
[121:59.45]There you go.
[122:13.38]There.
[122:15.88]That's better.
[122:25.19]But, no, I really like that about the game.
[122:28.99]I like it so... It's... There's so many random things to make and look at and craft and you only have a certain amount of slots.
[122:37.75]So you have... It's just managing your self.
[122:42.20]But it's hard.
[122:42.76]Look at all this stuff.
[122:43.46]I don't even know how this stuff even... Okay, I can make a pistol.
[122:47.04]But it's one shot.
[122:48.78]Hold on.
[122:51.43]I need the weapon part.
[122:53.69]This is what I was talking about.
[122:56.37]Now I'm... Okay, I want the... But what about my... Alright.
[123:05.14]Okay.
[123:17.20]Um... Okay.
[123:30.57]One at a time.
[123:40.19]I need to go back and set the traps back up over here.
[123:45.05]So I have... How many traps do I have?
[123:47.53]I'm gonna bring the gasoline over and I'm going to fill the gas tank again.
[123:51.82]The shovel is fixed.
[123:53.40]I think I want another torch because this one's almost gone.
[123:55.84]Put the glass back here.
[123:58.04]Oh, that's right!
[123:59.00]I was gonna make an upgrade for the shovel.
[124:03.52]Which is... I need four more scrap.
[124:06.21]We're gonna go get scrap.
[124:08.19]Oh, this game's fucking awesome.
[124:11.44]Okay.
[124:15.34]I'm gonna sell this battery.
[124:16.86]Because I don't want it.
[124:22.42]All these nails.
[124:24.10]I'm gonna need these, though.
[124:26.24]And some boards.
[124:27.12]Do I have any more?
[124:27.94]I have two.
[124:35.17]Take the potato and just eat it.
[124:38.41]Toolbox.
[124:39.39]Medium caliber bullet.
[124:45.07]Okay, I'm gonna get another wire and make another lockpick.
[124:51.54]Okay.
[124:56.06]Um, yes.
[124:58.46]I think.
[124:58.80]You... No, no, no, no, no.
[125:14.39]Ah, I'm bored, is what I need from you.
[125:16.25]No, I don't, because there's wood down.
[125:19.65]Alright.
[125:21.57]Go get wood from the thing down below you.
[125:24.53]That's the task I'm doing right now.
[125:41.96]Stay frozen, stay frozen.
[125:45.60]Stay frozen, stay frozen, stay frozen, stay frozen, stay frozen.
[125:47.86]It's frozen.
[125:48.28]Good.
[125:48.52]Okay, got the wood.
[125:50.54]Craft it.
[125:51.02]Alright.
[125:57.70]I now have plenty of these.
[125:58.70]Let's board this up again.
[125:59.76]Bang.
[126:07.01]Dermot's not going to answer us about his tears.
[126:08.73]Is that going to be my tears?
[126:12.43]So that's done.
[126:13.25]Now I'm not going to freak out over that.
[126:17.29]Now I need to make a bear trap.
[126:22.97]I can actually do that later when I come back with more scrap.
[126:26.04]This is a scrap run.
[126:29.76]Try to find Chicken Lady.
[126:32.82]Which is down here.
[126:34.58]I'm going to say it's right here.
[126:36.62]Find Chicken Lady and get scrap.
[126:38.52]Is this for today.
[126:40.05]That's what we're doing today.
[126:43.09]And rearrange this ship.
[126:47.82]Why is there meat in here?
[126:51.74]Weapons go up.
[126:52.58]I'll do this later.
[126:54.38]So many random things that I have now.
[126:58.94]Aye yi yi.
[127:05.97]Okay.
[127:15.81]Scrap metal.
[127:19.60]I'm starting to lose my mind because I'm just going over a thousand times.
[127:22.58]Alright, scrap metal.
[127:23.24]Let's put everything in.
[127:24.06]Keep the potato.
[127:25.96]I'll keep this torch because I'll burn these both out.
[127:28.79]That's fine.
[127:29.43]Gasoline can stay over here.
[127:30.65]I got plenty.
[127:32.15]Let's go.
[127:33.19]I'm ready.
[127:34.51]I am ready for this.
[127:35.25]Let's go get scrap.
[127:39.95]I have to be back here in 15 hours.
[127:42.91]Chicken head.
[127:44.33]Good reminder.
[127:45.09]Thank you.
[127:55.87]Thank you!
[127:58.21]What happened?
[128:00.57]Oh, my house is poisoned.
[128:37.70]Scrap.
[128:38.80]I said I was trying to get scrap.
[128:42.24]Use your Molotov?
[128:43.00]I'm just gonna get over there.
[128:49.93]I'm gonna make another torch anyways.
[128:55.53]Okay, good.
[128:56.65]Somebody stepped in that last night, apparently.
[128:58.37]Alright.
[129:01.91]I got a few scrap.
[129:03.39]Good.
[129:06.85]Make another torch.
[129:09.95]Ignored?
[129:10.65]Who am I ignoring?
[129:13.15]Who am I ignoring?
[129:17.54]Us.
[129:19.76]How?
[129:20.16]What?
[129:24.10]Alright.
[129:24.82]It's time.
[129:28.18]Scrap run.
[129:29.58]Chicken house.
[129:33.04]No, don't say the word chicken.
[129:35.68]Because I can't eat like fried chicken.
[129:38.00]And I want like a fried chicken sandwich now.
[129:40.10]And it's over.
[129:40.62]And I can't do it.
[129:41.88]I can't have that.
[129:42.46]I'm going to have to eat like turkey patties.
[129:50.01]But those are fine.
[129:52.09]Alright, let's go down.
[130:01.15]Probably... Animal?
[130:08.85]Alright, where is Chicken Lady?
[130:13.05]There's this big open field here.
[130:17.81]Wood.
[130:18.83]I'll take it.
[130:19.95]Road to the village?
[130:21.05]I can't get into any of this.
[130:31.94]Road to the village.
[130:36.38]Gutted pig.
[130:49.97]Is this poison?
[130:50.63]Where the hell am I going?
[130:57.14]Am I going to a new map?
[131:05.60]I can't do that now.
[131:20.92]A shiny stone has been pressed into the mud-covered head.
[131:24.70]Take the stone.
[131:25.38]This is Indiana Jones type shit.
[131:26.98]No.
[131:27.76]I'm not taking it.
[131:29.50]Not yet.
[131:33.40]I take the stone.
[131:34.02]All of a sudden a boulder is going to land on me.
[131:35.72]I'm going to alert the horde.
[131:44.29]Something here.
[131:44.85]What's this?
[131:45.17]A wagon?
[131:45.53]A meat wagon.
[131:47.71]A dock.
[131:50.17]There's something in the water Phone Our woods are so beautiful this time of year I can't talk
[132:24.08]Where's my meat?
[132:28.16]I should get two kilos of meat for this month.
[132:33.12]Antec won't save you this time.
[132:36.34]You hear me?
[132:37.00]Give me the fucking meat.
[132:46.31]If he ever tries to come back... Fucking quack doctor.
[132:56.45]Bug.
[132:57.11]Bag.
[132:57.65]Doctor bag.
[133:03.72]Cool.
[133:07.80]Who are you?
[133:08.34]I don't know.
[133:11.68]Get away from me.
[133:12.22]Alright, alright, alright.
[133:12.84]I'm fine, I'm fine.
[133:14.99]I don't want to piss off any NPCs.
[133:17.11]Generators running.
[133:18.01]Two generators.
[133:22.77]Barricaded windows.
[133:24.21]Okay, let me...
[133:27.23]I'll go back around.
[133:27.83]I'm gonna go in this room.
[133:36.07]Destroyed well.
[133:36.95]I can go in this.
[133:40.81]There's pigs in here?
[133:49.22]How much gas you got in these?
[133:52.04]It's a lot.
[133:52.62]Alright, so this is... Nothing I can do here.
[134:03.29]What now?
[134:06.84]Get the fuck away from my home!
[134:10.80]There's no more meat!
[134:14.72]The sow is starving!
[134:23.11]Get or I'll let Antek loose!
[134:34.63]What is Antec?
[134:37.89]Oh my goodness.
[134:39.53]Alright, I'm out.
[134:51.84]Chest.
[134:57.38]Map.
[134:58.14]Got a map of the area.
[135:00.55]I can't do that right now.
[135:02.95]What do you mean?
[135:03.43]Map.
[135:03.59]I just got a map.
[135:06.73]What a joyous day.
[135:08.03]We shall meet again today.
[135:09.33]I hope she'll enjoy what I've prepared for her.
[135:12.38]She hasn't had an appetite lately, but it's okay.
[135:15.00]We have our ways around that, don't we?
[135:17.70]She must eat rich meals.
[135:19.60]I've dug out something delicious for her today.
[135:22.14]My queen.
[135:23.48]Only I can be close to her.
[135:24.86]No one else.
[135:25.76]No one.
[135:26.73]No one else will get close to you anymore.
[135:28.83]You need to eat everything.
[135:30.53]I... can get you today if you're...
[135:38.60]Monarchy.
[135:40.08]If you're hungry, I shall now... I shall show you something.
[135:44.70]I've found the way.
[135:48.04]16.
[135:48.06]16.
[135:49.25]That's probably part one of the code.
[136:06.34]Alright, code in there.
[136:09.07]Time has stood still in here, by the way, which is interesting.
[136:16.45]So, I can't do anything in there.
[136:18.15]There's a guy in there that doesn't want me in there.
[136:21.17]People want meat?
[136:24.06]Right.
[136:24.80]I'm assuming Antec is the pig.
[136:27.22]Like, the prize pig.
[136:31.64]Go down here.
[136:37.78]An old destroyed well.
[136:38.80]If I find a long sturdy rope or chain, I should be able to descend it.
[136:45.34]What?
[136:46.50]I can descend into the well?
[136:50.95]He's been hiding in his cottage for the last couple of days.
[136:56.37]He'll end up like the others.
[137:00.09]I'm telling you.
[137:04.25]He'll run off into the woods and disappear.
[137:06.57]So was this supposed to be my village that I disappeared into the woods?
[137:11.38]These people aren't all messed up yet.
[137:13.44]The villagers turn their heads away from me.
[137:15.14]I don't think I'm welcome here.
[137:17.28]Well, I have a shovel, so that don't matter.
[137:19.00]I need to get in this room.
[137:33.07]Okay.
[137:40.35]Not a very good puzzle.
[137:42.31]I hate to say, sorry to tell you.
[137:45.96]All it took was me to put weight into it.
[137:47.44]Alright, what about up here?
[138:02.20]Shelf, nothing.
[138:10.10]Why is it going on?
[138:11.50]Why is it doing this?
[138:24.63]You gotta pick up the shit before you get in trouble.
[139:00.27]I can hear you.
[139:04.05]Hear you.
[139:07.33]Hear you.
[139:10.91]I just want to look under your bed and see if you have any coins.
[139:13.39]Do I kill this thing?
[139:57.81]So, uh, how is he?
[140:00.68]Um... He's gonna be fine.
[140:04.84]Just give him Tylenol.
[140:06.06]Okay, I have to go now.
[140:09.07]Bye.
[140:16.75]It's been ten years since they took her.
[140:28.80]Jerma, wake up!
[140:31.06]I'm just slowly trying to go through that.
[140:32.92]Time is standing still.
[140:33.82]I don't want to miss much.
[140:49.97]Kind of an empty house.
[140:55.39]Nothing.
[140:58.83]It's just a hotel.
[141:04.70]Siphon.
[141:06.34]Ooh, what's a siphon?
[141:09.10]What does this do?
[141:13.28]This is a whipped cream canister.
[141:14.87]Okay.
[141:15.15]Found a whipped cream canister.
[141:24.59]Oven.
[141:24.89]Nothing in this oven.
[141:28.06]Chest over here.
[141:38.15]I don't need to walk, which is good.
[141:43.49]Bread and gasoline.
[141:45.79]Kind of just taking everything, which is not really something I should be doing, I don't think.
[141:51.86]What do you want?
[141:54.72]It's quite a wide tunnel.
[141:55.72]There are finger marks on the ground.
[141:57.26]It must have been dug up by using bare hands.
[142:00.88]Large hole in the ground.
[142:02.28]Let me dig in peace.
[142:03.30]I got a shovel, too!
[142:05.12]Someone's inside this hole.
[142:06.02]I can barely make out his silhouette.
[142:07.28]Looks like a grown man with long, disheveled hair.
[142:10.04]He's completely covered in mud.
[142:11.12]Maybe I should just go... What the... What?
[142:27.84]Wait, this is... my house?
[142:35.59]Oh, shit.
[142:36.21]Where is my house?
[142:41.11]Is that because I have the shovel?
[142:45.80]Oh, that's awesome.
[142:46.68]Okay, cool.
[142:51.82]Go back in?
[142:52.34]I will.
[142:53.04]I'm just gonna deposit my stuff that I picked up.
[142:55.64]Didn't pick up any mushrooms.
[143:01.26]Alright.
[143:02.34]I got lots more gasoline, which I'm just going to fill.
[143:05.21]Alright.
[143:06.95]This is what we're going to do here.
[143:08.95]I'm using both these.
[143:09.97]Completely.
[143:11.75]Matchsticks.
[143:14.85]Rope.
[143:15.23]Alcohol.
[143:15.93]Shiny stone.
[143:16.67]Scrap metal.
[143:18.01]Battery.
[143:20.61]Bread.
[143:21.01]Whatever.
[143:21.57]I'm out of room.
[143:26.00]Alright.
[143:26.24]I'm going to get rid of these gasoline cans.
[143:30.62]And dump them.
[143:33.69]So we're going to go generator, fill the whole thing, just max it out.
[143:37.09]Completely.
[143:37.59]I'm really enjoying this stream.
[143:44.39]Hey, thanks.
[143:45.73]I am too.
[143:46.16]This is kind of just a fun game.
[143:55.62]Does anything else take gas?
[143:57.78]Or should I actually just fill this?
[143:59.96]What do I do?
[144:10.73]Alright, there's two canisters.
[144:11.75]That's some space let up then.
[144:14.67]Go back here.
[144:15.41]Okay, repair.
[144:19.53]I don't need to repair anything.
[144:20.45]I've got another torch.
[144:23.27]Anything else I need to bring to that?
[144:28.93]Maybe I'll bring the knife.
[144:30.19]Just in case.
[144:36.29]I could probably bring another heal too.
[144:39.74]I need some more rags.
[144:43.66]I'll be alright.
[144:44.52]I'll be alright.
[144:44.98]I'm gonna heal with the bug thing.
[144:49.73]Yeah, I'll be good.
[144:50.37]I'll be good.
[144:53.59]Bring a pill.
[144:55.17]I'll bring... I'll bring two.
[144:57.03]It's a heal.
[145:00.03]Alright, yeah.
[145:00.73]I'll bring two.
[145:01.19]Alright, let's go back.
[145:07.31]I have more room in my inventory now.
[145:11.91]Where's the Animal Crossing OST?
[145:16.43]I don't know.
[145:16.99]It's... I lost it in the mail.
[145:21.34]Let's see.
[145:21.82]Back in here.
[145:30.36]Creepy Animal Crossing.
[145:31.76]So now time has stopped again.
[145:35.32]Bring out the shovel.
[145:37.30]There's my shortcut back, and then there's this person.
[145:43.50]Alright, I got another thing to explore.
[145:45.00]I really think I'm at the stage of the game now where I probably need to make a gun.
[145:56.25]But it's... I know what's going to happen.
[145:58.29]I'm going to make a gun, and I'm not going to shoot it one time.
[146:01.81]I'm going to wait until the very last boss of the game.
[146:05.79]And I'm going to unload the clip on the boss and miss 7 or 8 of the 12 shots.
[146:13.08]I should probably just sell it.
[146:16.67]Oh, what's... Let's go back down here.
[146:19.27]Didn't I get a map?
[146:32.29]Make gun.
[146:33.65]Are you serious?
[146:38.30]Where's the door for this place?
[146:39.88]It's over there.
[146:40.38]How do I get in here?
[146:52.36]This is one of the only survival horror games that I've played where getting a gun is still scary.
[146:58.40]I could see that.
[147:00.39]Very much so.
[147:01.09]Let's go up here first.
[147:03.79]It's locked.
[147:04.27]I could open it with a lockpick.
[147:17.00]What was the point of that?
[147:23.86]Was there actually no point to that?
[147:27.34]Or does that give me access to this, like, weird courtyard?
[147:36.93]Bread oven.
[147:38.35]A brick oven used to bake bread.
[147:40.23]Don't talk about pizza.
[147:42.37]I can't eat that either.
[147:48.60]The brick oven used to bake bread.
[147:49.92]I could open it with a lockpick.
[147:59.42]I'm gonna use all my lockpicks for this shit?
[148:01.14]There's something dead here.
[148:10.87]Potato.
[148:20.75]Liar.
[148:23.91]How many dead bodies are in here?
[148:25.19]Oh my god!
[148:33.22]Well, I got my lockpicks back.
[148:59.79]Let's go make one.
[149:06.40]I need a key.
[149:12.77]Lockpick, lockpick, lockpick, key.
[149:16.09]Well, that sucks.
[149:20.39]At least I know this is here.
[149:29.04]Smash the door.
[149:31.72]Smash the door.
[149:32.70]He missed some.
[149:33.48]Did I?
[149:40.49]No, I didn't.
[149:45.13]I got them all.
[149:54.72]Smash the door.
[149:55.42]That's not gonna work.
[150:12.18]Who the hell are you?
[150:14.18]Uh... I don't know.
[150:19.70]A jar filled with cooked meat.
[150:24.30]Alright.
[150:24.94]Help yourself.
[150:25.68]Whatever you fancy.
[150:28.18]Nice.
[150:28.66]Well, thank you.
[150:34.74]Could open it with a lockpick.
[150:40.38]Meat grinder?
[151:01.18]They're eating people.
[151:02.38]Is that what this is?
[151:03.28]They're grinding up people.
[151:04.96]The pig is just a show.
[151:06.04]It doesn't actually do anything.
[151:07.00]It doesn't mean anything.
[151:15.68]I'm going to make a... Something with this.
[151:23.94]Bandage.
[151:31.13]Alright.
[151:31.79]I think it's... I gotta go deposit some stuff.
[151:41.55]I need a key.
[151:43.71]I'm... I'm fine.
[151:44.85]I'm right here.
[151:45.45]Just climb through the damn window.
[151:51.14]Kill this guy.
[151:54.16]Kill him.
[151:57.16]Kill him.
[151:58.22]You want me to kill that guy?
[152:00.30]He didn't do anything.
[152:01.46]No, he didn't do anything.
[152:03.46]What did he do?
[152:03.92]He told me I could have whatever he... He told me I could have whatever I wanted in his house.
[152:09.60]That's sort of strange.
[152:13.97]So, I don't know.
[152:15.01]I'm alright.
[152:18.59]I need to go get rid of this stuff.
[152:19.95]I think there's only one more building I didn't check.
[152:26.97]At least one up here.
[152:34.59]Yeah, I didn't go up here, but I'm gonna get rid of this first.
[152:36.77]Yeah, there's actually a couple places I haven't been, huh?
[152:45.12]This town is huge.
[152:46.04]Alright, wait, oh wait, wait, wait, wait.
[152:54.72]This is a big-ass town.
[153:00.12]Explain the corpses outside of this house.
[153:03.68]He's grinding people up and he's feeding them to people.
[153:07.50]Yeah?
[153:11.67]But he gave me three pipes.
[153:14.41]And I got two pieces of wire from his house.
[153:22.07]I can throw a knife in his head when I get back.
[153:30.03]Where's the exit?
[153:33.24]I wish I had a map.
[153:34.05]Where are those little things?
[153:36.39]Down here?
[153:44.77]Where the hell is that thing?
[153:47.03]There it is.
[153:53.22]Alright, hold on.
[153:54.02]I've got to just get every item that I can get from here.
[154:01.90]Time is freezing.
[154:07.30]Alright, through the window.
[154:09.68]Did I get anything to cook?
[154:11.02]What about the meat?
[154:11.86]Wait, that meat I could probably cook.
[154:13.34]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[154:19.22]Oh well.
[154:21.10]Okay, this is where it gets, this is where it gets weird because I can't carry any more of this stuff.
[154:30.09]It's time to get rid of, I have to get rid of some things.
[154:33.19]I'm going to upgrade the shovel.
[154:36.16]I want this to have better durability.
[154:39.73]Attacks use less stamina?
[154:42.85]Or... Okay, more damage?
[154:45.87]No, more durability.
[154:48.09]Is absolutely what I need.
[154:52.40]Build gun.
[154:56.48]I need the weapon parts, which I don't have.
[155:00.88]Homemade shotgun.
[155:02.08]No, I need the weapon parts.
[155:04.35]You get that the next day.
[155:07.44]So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a lockpick.
[155:11.63]And then I'm going to make... I'm going to upgrade the shovel, which is more durability.
[155:18.79]Boom.
[155:28.47]Hmm.
[155:29.65]I'm going to hold on to it for sharpened.
[155:33.85]I can build the homemade shotgun now.
[155:36.53]Yeah, but do I want to do that, though?
[155:41.52]I don't think I want to do that.
[155:44.14]I think I want to make this thing with the weapon parts.
[155:47.56]No.
[155:49.54]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[155:53.57]Alright, wood.
[155:56.05]Aye, aye, aye.
[155:58.75]I have to get rid of the board with the nails.
[156:01.47]Because they're like a...
[156:13.02]Just eat the potato.
[156:13.92]Um, okay.
[156:15.12]A jar of meat.
[156:17.26]I got these glass bottles.
[156:18.71]They're not doing anything for me.
[156:21.59]I'm just gonna pretend I filled them with the meat.
[156:24.37]I can keep five glass bottles.
[156:30.63]My wardrobe.
[156:32.32]Oh.
[156:34.24]Stupid-ass thing.
[156:36.02]Where's my wardrobe?
[156:39.16]Oh, shit.
[156:39.80]Okay, this is where I'm gonna put bottles.
[156:45.11]No, bottles are useless.
[156:46.41]I don't want bottles anymore.
[156:47.45]I need to... Alright, hold on.
[156:54.04]Shit.
[156:57.44]Fuck!
[156:58.00]Okay, um... This is... My metal pipes are going in here.
[157:02.06]And this bone is gonna go in here.
[157:03.48]I'm gonna forget this exists.
[157:07.79]Anything else I can put items in?
[157:11.81]In the table.
[157:13.91]Put bottles in this table.
[157:16.25]And you always... This is where the tape is gonna go.
[157:18.21]No, this is where... That's fine.
[157:30.84]Wait, let go of this.
[157:33.06]There's another wardrobe right here.
[157:34.12]Alright.
[157:37.81]I'm gonna be scattered around everywhere.
[157:42.73]Bottles in the wardrobe.
[157:44.79]Alcohol in the wardrobe.
[157:46.09]Uh, no, that's not gonna work.
[157:48.38]Drugs in the wardrobe.
[157:50.42]Metal pipe.
[157:51.10]This is gonna be items scattered everywhere.
[157:54.84]God damn it.
[157:57.82]Um... Bread in the wardrobe.
[158:02.82]Drugs in the wardrobe.
[158:05.05]Meat in the wardrobe.
[158:07.13]You guys just have to remember where these items are, because these don't stack.
[158:10.96]Items that do not stack have to come out of here.
[158:14.85]Because they're just taking up huge amounts of space that I could stack items in.
[158:21.13]Batteries are going in the wardrobe.
[158:22.71]I'm going to eat the potato.
[158:26.99]Get this broken glass out of here.
[158:28.42]Alright, it's not as horrible as it was before.
[158:35.02]Meat on the bone.
[158:35.86]I can't sell the guy.
[158:36.94]There's nobody here.
[158:39.56]Okay.
[158:40.30]Clothes.
[158:43.96]Wardrobe.

[159:10.41]Where's the bone?
[159:12.83]What'd I do with the bone?
[159:14.29]This is what I was afraid of.
[159:29.58]Cook the bone?
[159:37.47]What are you guys talking about?

[166:35.05]Just put a little bit of glass there.
[166:39.83]Let's throw a bottle on the ground.
[166:41.61]And break one.
[166:50.87]Do I have to pick this up?
[166:52.35]Or will it just... Can I leave it there after throwing it?
[166:57.35]Or do I have to actually set this as a trap?
[167:05.46]I can leave it.
[167:06.08]Okay.
[167:06.72]That's good to know.
[167:07.22]I'm going to do the same thing right here.

[167:30.86]Is this like a meme or something that I'm missing?
[167:34.38]Jeff just gave five community subs.
[167:36.53]We should be focusing on that.
[167:43.63]Thank you, Jeff, for the five community subs.
[167:46.43]Appreciate it.
[167:49.54]Use meat on the bone.
[167:52.94]I'm gonna do that one time.

[168:09.77]Good.
[168:17.77]Good.
[168:19.27]Alright, let's go.
[168:23.79]It's a win-win.
[168:24.83]How is that a win-win?
[168:27.31]What do you mean?
[168:34.90]Morty.
[168:36.54]Morty.
[168:39.29]Morty, you put the meat on the bone?
[168:40.29]Morty.
[168:40.73]Morty.
[168:47.73]Why am I getting -2?
[168:48.99]Somebody in chat wrote that and I was just referencing it.
[168:52.53]I just said it.
[169:07.94]Szechuan reference.
[169:10.00]Alright, pay attention.
[169:11.66]Pay attention, folks.
[169:15.62]We've got an alien coming through.
[169:18.94]First alien of the night.
[169:20.42]I'm gonna throw this knife right between the eyes.
[169:32.74]There's no trap here, so I have to do it.
[169:34.09]I have to do it right away.
[169:34.93]Did he give up?
[169:39.91]What'd he stop for?
[169:46.47]He decided to go a different... There's two of them.
[170:09.04]Uh-oh.
[170:09.44]Uh-oh.
[170:20.52]Fuck.
[170:20.68]Where's my knife?
[170:24.40]Where's the knife?
[170:32.20]Shit.
[170:37.82]I've got to get somebody stuck in a trap.
[170:54.12]Ah!
[170:56.04]Oh no!
[170:56.48]Don't panic!
[170:57.00]Don't panic!
[171:12.36]I threw the knife and it didn't kill him.
[171:17.92]It kills everybody in one hit.
[171:20.06]But the one guy that comes through the left window doesn't die in one hit from the knife.
[171:25.16]His two friends died in one hit.
[171:40.54]Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!
[171:50.57]No, no, no, no, no, I need this.
[171:51.93]I need weapon part.
[171:54.89]Here, you can take these potatoes.
[171:56.37]I'm not gonna eat them.
[171:59.53]I need to get that weapon part, because I want to build a gun.
[172:05.20]Quick, use the music stand.
[172:08.02]Alright, it's time to make a gun.
[172:10.02]I'm sick of this.
[172:12.04]I can... Medium caliber bullet.
[172:21.38]Medium caliber magazine.
[172:26.91]Shiny stun.

[172:37.39]So that, I need weapon part, I need 450.
[172:43.19]What is this going to get me here?
[172:45.28]That's 2, 3, 4, 10.
[172:49.24]Alright.
[172:53.42]Now I just need 40 more.
[172:55.67]And I'm going to make a gosh darn gun.
[173:01.11]Why am I selling gun ammo for a gun?
[173:02.69]Because I want a pistol.
[173:04.72]That's a medium gun.
[173:05.78]That's a medium-sized gun.
[173:07.80]So... You can take the bread, too.
[173:10.46]I'm not gonna eat it.
[173:13.00]Take the board with nails.
[173:13.96]I'm not gonna eat it.
[173:24.37]He doesn't have enough room in his inventory.
[173:28.53]Wait, you, you have to hold, you have, are you going to have, if I give you bread, are you going to have it forever?
[173:35.47]Oh, this is not good.
[173:45.86]I have to get him.
[173:49.66]What do I give you?
[173:52.36]Pills?
[173:53.12]Yeah.
[173:53.50]Okay.
[173:59.05]I'm not going to sell the bread then.
[174:01.21]Yes, I am.
[174:01.93]Who cares?
[174:04.76]What about alcohol?
[174:05.54]You got alcohol stored there, right?
[174:09.42]Okay.
[174:12.02]I'm going to go sell you one of my many tubes.
[174:19.05]What's in this wardrobe?
[174:21.39]No, that's important stuff.
[174:24.61]Here we go.
[174:25.41]You can have a metal... No, I might need that.
[174:30.17]You can buy and sell at the same time.
[174:31.63]Yeah, I know.
[174:32.97]I need $450, man.
[174:37.49]I don't want to buy anything right now.
[174:38.75]I need $450 reputation dollars.
[174:40.89]Alright, you can have it too.
[174:43.69]I've decided. ...
[175:00.10]Why did I do this?
[175:11.17]Do they have bottles?
[175:15.85]What does he have, a stack of?
[175:19.85]He has a stack of...
[175:31.37]Buy the part.
[175:38.17]That was the right thing, right?
[175:39.17]Yeah.
[175:40.31]Gun.
[175:42.51]That's what that person meant when they said buy and sell at the same time.
[175:45.79]Sorry.
[175:48.21]I'm stupid.
[175:49.36]I thought you meant like I could... I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[175:52.94]Anyways, it's time to make a pistol.
[175:55.46]Small caliber, semi-automatic pistol.
[175:59.01]I have two clips for this gun.
[176:02.42]Small caliber magazine, small caliber pistol.
[176:07.22]Bingo.
[176:14.56]Gun with no ammo?
[176:15.68]I got ammo right here.
[176:18.72]I got two clips.
[176:19.46]I need another scrap metal.
[176:27.59]Gonna buy one.
[176:31.80]It's loaded.
[176:32.38]Yeah, that's fine.
[176:33.50]How many shots does it have?
[176:40.28]Where the hell is it?
[176:49.87]How many bullets does this have?
[176:51.79]How do I shoot this?
[176:52.57]How do I aim this?
[177:00.21]I don't want to fire it accidentally.
[177:03.62]Okay.
[177:05.58]So you aim it like that.
[177:10.35]How many shots are in it?
[177:11.19]Okay.
[177:21.70]I'm ready.
[177:23.22]I got my gun for emergency situations.
[177:25.06]I have magazine for it.
[177:29.10]I need another scrap metal to repair the shovel.
[177:31.92]And then I can move on with my day.
[177:36.64]What do I need?
[177:37.16]Ten?
[177:40.64]Just give me all of them.
[178:11.77]Prepared.
[178:17.57]Good.
[178:20.49]I have nothing to cook.
[178:22.17]I'm going to go back to the weird house.
[178:25.05]This is nice and organized.
[178:27.57]I need a gas guzzler.
[178:32.11]Get rid of this.
[178:32.89]I don't need this fucking thing.
[178:36.29]Inventory space is increasing, so this is good.
[178:39.93]Jar of meat.
[178:41.77]Jar of meat on bone.
[178:42.85]I'm not going to use that.
[178:44.51]Meat and bone.
[178:48.84]See you guys in two weeks.
[178:53.20]I need to make more traps, which I need scrap for that.
[178:55.42]Of course I do.
[178:59.22]Meat, not jar of meat.
[179:12.13]Okay.
[179:15.67]I'm going to store this.
[179:17.98]I have two of three heals.
[179:19.60]Let's just take them all.
[179:22.98]Extra torch.
[179:24.18]Anything else to satisfy me?
[179:29.22]No.
[179:31.33]Yeah, let's go.
[179:32.89]Jar of bone in meat.
[179:38.75]Alright, now you're just, like, speaking... Now you're just... Alright, I'm ready.
[179:45.85]Repair item, we're good.
[179:47.47]I'm gonna head back to the town and see if I can figure something else out.
[179:52.05]I do have to go pick up my items, though.
[179:56.03]And the generator has been on the whole time.
[179:58.17]Why did everybody not scream at me?
[179:59.91]Usually people spam in Capital's generator, but nobody did.
[180:04.29]What's up with that, huh?
[180:23.83]If you reload, you lose the magazine.
[180:25.39]Thank you for telling me that.
[180:26.25]I would not have known that.
[180:28.51]Okay, I got a lockpick.
[180:32.15]Pretty good.
[180:35.26]Get rid of this.
[180:38.05]That's fine.
[180:39.11]Let's store that over here.
[180:41.80]Keep the rag in case I need to make another.
[180:43.28]No, I'm not going to need to.
[180:47.38]Chicken head.
[180:47.90]Keep that.
[180:48.54]Watch.
[180:48.92]Keep that.
[180:50.18]Good to go.
[180:50.60]Alright.
[180:54.47]Off I go.
[180:57.25]Let's move.
[180:58.47]Back to the town.
[181:00.01]Scary town.
[181:01.17]Scrap metal.
[181:02.01]Need it.
[181:02.29]A lot of it.
[181:06.87]How do you reload?
[181:07.63]It's probably R. So I'm not going to press R. Alright.
[181:20.62]There's a spot up here that I didn't check out.
[181:30.42]Oh, it's a reference to something else.
[181:31.68]It's a reference to another game.
[181:34.01]Well, this is Darkwood.
[181:36.20]This is not that other video game that you're referencing.
[181:38.22]Alright, then down here is the... Wait, who's that?
[181:50.99]Nobody taught you how to use the door.
[181:53.01]It's Chicken Lady!
[181:53.95]It's Chicken Lady!
[181:57.61]The old lady squints at me, her eyes full of suspicion.
[181:59.96]She hugs her chickens possessively.
[182:05.53]Better keep the hands off of my hens, you bloody scoundrel.
[182:11.41]The old lady puts one of the hens to her ear, mumbling under her breath after a moment she calms down.
[182:17.59]I've seen my share of things, lived through many a war, but nothing like this, Lord be my witness.
[182:32.61]This accursed land ain't a place for men, ain't a place for hens either.
[182:36.45]Alright, show item.
[182:42.56]Look at this!
[182:45.04]Hail spells, where'd you get it?
[182:46.04]Where'd you find it?
[182:47.02]The old lady seems disturbed.
[182:48.10]The hens fell silent.
[182:49.86]I can feel the tension in the air.
[182:53.29]Holy mother, it's Janak's little hen.
[182:56.67]A gift from me, my little brother.
[182:59.50]Couple of days ago, he got mad.
[183:01.00]I told him stay.
[183:02.34]You're not one of them brainy fellas.
[183:03.86]You know nothing.
[183:05.00]But he wouldn't listen.
[183:05.68]He went off into the... He went off... And off he went to that other fella.
[183:11.19]Here, take this.
[183:12.25]He went to see this fella.
[183:13.75]See him?
[183:14.19]He never came back.
[183:17.59]That was a talk to Transformer.
[183:19.61]The lady shoves a crumpled photo in your hand.
[183:27.31]Item found.
[183:27.81]Photo of the doctor.
[183:32.73]Okay.
[184:03.02]Poor Hanuska has lost her mind.
[184:05.66]Her fella knocked her up with this abomination.
[184:09.16]Even them mongrels tucked their tails and yelped when they saw it.
[184:12.90]I tell you, poor soul.
[184:15.22]They burned her fella with the shack that took the horror somewhere.
[184:19.90]Everyone got the jitters, little wonder.
[184:22.64]The old lady smiles kindly, baring her three yellow teeth.
[184:29.99]It was a long time ago, but you remember it still, my little hen, don't you?
[184:38.14]Thank the Lord for our sow!
[184:40.70]Poor thing seems sickly, but she has more life in her than a lot of us, if you ask me.
[184:46.40]Only thanks to her we got something to put in the pot these days.
[184:50.92]Okay, so... This is the- take this, he went to see this fellow, see him, he never came back.
[184:57.73]I have to find this doctor.
[185:01.85]Holy mother this creep again may the devil take him in his blasted violin The old lady turns in red and starts to scream Devil fuck to your mother get away from me house Where Map location already marked pigshed
[185:32.62]Why do I not have a map of this place?
[185:48.23]Cool.
[185:51.07]These are hens.
[185:51.87]Right.
[185:53.25]Oh, another toolbox.
[185:54.84]I'm not taking... I don't pick up bottles anymore.
[185:58.90]A cross covered in mud and sticks.
[186:01.78]A wooden cross covered in mud and sticks.
[186:06.72]I need a key.
[186:17.75]None of my keys fit.
[186:34.01]Tractor.
[186:34.47]I'm gonna be gassing the steering wheel.
[186:38.11]Doesn't that, uh, the spaceship guy need a steering wheel?
[186:47.26]Ruined.
[186:47.78]Scorched remains of the wooden henhouse structure.
[186:59.59]Scorched remains of the wooden henhouse structure.
[187:05.90]Hello?
[187:10.68]Basket full of eggs.
[187:12.72]Chicken egg.
[187:16.81]More chicken eggs.
[187:17.77]Nice.
[187:24.59]A red egg.
[187:34.18]That's a red egg.
[187:36.44]Cool.
[187:39.48]Alright.
[187:40.80]I think I got everything.
[187:45.13]Wooden egg.
[187:46.29]Wooden chicken egg.
[187:49.65]Alright.
[187:52.97]Can't... Can I smash this?
[187:55.12]It's a metal door.
[187:55.94]I can't smash a metal door.
[187:59.06]What about on the outside?
[188:18.79]This is one of those scenarios when you go to, like, your kid's recital.
[188:24.86]And it gets introduced as... And here's little Gary Elbertson!
[188:28.98]And he's like, oh, that's my son!
[188:42.53]Come on!
[188:44.25]You've been practicing!
[188:45.13]It's my son, yeah.
[188:53.44]That's your son?
[188:58.00]He's trying!
[188:59.14]He's trying, he's practicing a lot.
[189:02.12]Lately he's in the garage and uh...
[189:06.43]Well, what the fuck does your kid do, huh?
[189:10.07]I bet you your kid plays the piano!
[189:13.35]That's easy compared to the violin!
[189:16.69]You don't know shit!
[189:27.14]What is going on?
[189:30.92]I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
[189:32.94]What?
[189:34.40]Somebody under here?
[189:39.59]The musician is the car.
[189:42.55]It's like that Lindsay Lohan movie.
[189:46.96]It's not my fault.
[189:47.84]I know it doesn't sound too great.
[189:49.32]My violin, it's a bit broken.
[189:51.28]I won't play anymore.
[189:52.42]I'm sorry.
[189:53.22]I know it's under there.
[189:56.24]Um, sir, have you been in that hut?
[189:59.32]The chicken lady's hut.
[190:00.22]You're not afraid of her?
[190:01.60]You're brave.
[190:03.76]Have you seen her?
[190:05.38]The pretty lady.
[190:06.76]She's the most beautiful lady in the world.
[190:08.70]I watch her through the cracks in the windows.
[190:10.21]She changes when I watch her.
[190:11.23]She gets more beautiful.
[190:12.29]I play for her.
[190:13.97]I want to be happy because she doesn't seem to be.
[190:15.97]The chicken lady locked her in that room.
[190:17.57]What?
[190:18.71]She keeps her there.
[190:19.61]She envies her.
[190:20.61]She won't allow anyone to see her.
[190:21.73]Even me.
[190:23.43]she knows very well that during the last cupola night I fished out the pretty lady's wreath from the river yes sir it's a chicken lady who knows what it means oh yes I'll become the pretty lady's husband we will walk hand in hand sir I will play for her sir I tried to release her but the chicken lady she chased me off she always does I also I look for the second key at Mr. jans but now he's disappeared I I don't know how to get in his house

[190:58.35]I gotta go.
[190:58.71]I'm out of here.
[190:59.75]That's, uh... Uh, okay, so Mr. J- It was Mr. Jan.
[191:07.14]Second key, Mr. Jan's, but he's disappeared.
[191:10.18]I don't know how to get into his house.
[191:12.48]So kind, so very kind.
[191:13.52]You're just like him.
[191:15.00]My daddy, but my papa has changed, mister.
[191:18.32]Just, uh, like my mommy.
[191:21.18]They will not listen to me.
[191:22.32]They won't hear how sad I am, sir.
[191:25.81]Oh, but I'm not boring you, sir.
[191:28.11]Please don't go, please.
[191:29.27]They hear me out.
[191:29.81]Don't go.
[191:31.73]Nervous grunting, you've heard from under the tractor.
[191:33.97]Perhaps you could help me.
[191:35.85]Leave board.
[191:39.56]Please find the key, good sir, to the pretty lady's room.
[191:43.34]The chicken lady has it.
[191:44.80]Well, Mr. Jan also has it.
[191:46.30]I saw him recently near the well.
[191:49.08]He used to play with me.
[191:50.18]We threw rocks into the well, and I looked into our reflections while making silly faces.
[191:55.36]Daddy used to say not to do it, else my face will stay that way.
[191:58.88]And now the water in the well is always hazy.
[192:01.98]It shows these weird images.
[192:04.71]The whale is here in the village.
[192:06.27]Maybe you will find him in there.
[192:07.51]He used to hang around often.
[192:09.85]He's staring into the whale as if looking for something.
[192:12.91]I must hide now.
[192:13.63]I'll hide from the chicken lady, the chicken lady of that place where they used to keep all the grain in the southeastern part of the forest.
[192:31.81]Give me the key if you find it.
[192:37.37]This is our doctor.
[192:38.17]Yes, he's just as brave and good as you are.
[192:40.49]He helped me.
[192:41.13]He's helping all of us.
[192:42.79]He gave me this beautiful mask so I could be healed of my afflictions.
[192:46.05]Maybe you could have one too.
[192:51.85]What about this road?
[192:55.19]My mommy once told me this road.
[192:57.33]She said people used to travel it.
[192:59.87]They would leave their houses and walk it during the night.
[193:02.17]I was scared of this story.
[193:03.95]I was afraid my mommy would go out too and leave me behind.
[193:10.34]Have you heard about the sow?
[193:11.48]The villagers keep this sow nearby.
[193:13.22]Pigshed, they call it.
[193:14.48]Mother of all pigs, they say.
[193:15.70]It's beautiful, but I've never seen it.
[193:18.20]They don't allow me near her.
[193:20.10]They chase me off.
[193:21.28]They always chase me off.
[193:23.92]He drops his gaze.
[193:26.97]Maybe you would be able to see her, mister.
[193:28.99]If you manage to get inside, maybe you could take even a wee piece of meat for me?
[193:32.53]Guy's asking a lot.
[193:35.19]Never eaten a pig and I've heard it's very tasty.
[193:37.01]Would you take some meat for me?
[193:40.92]This person's freaking me out.
[193:42.02]Alright.
[193:42.54]We got some info, though.
[193:46.24]Chicken lady's... bad.
[193:53.25]Wait, this... should I just... I could just break the window.
[194:02.53]Right?
[194:06.65]It's too strong.
[194:07.34]The barricade's too strong to dismantle.
[194:09.99]That's too strong.
[194:13.96]Alright, I gotta get to the well.
[194:21.30]The well needs to be repaired, though.
[194:25.19]Chicken lady's fucked up.
[194:28.65]Smash it, you dumb dumb.
[194:30.51]I wanna do it the right way.
[194:33.98]I wanna do it the correct way.
[194:39.40]I'm gonna go up.
[194:42.02]Time is still frozen?
[194:42.86]Yeah, time is frozen forever here, somehow.
[194:53.43]There's one more house up here.
[194:57.44]I'm gonna get closer to the action animal.
[195:02.12]This is where I was last time.
[195:07.53]Woman examine.
[195:09.05]Crate search.
[195:10.07]Doll.
[195:10.59]Don't touch that until I talk.
[195:16.62]The woman stares at the ground with a dead look.
[195:24.48]I'll trade you a half-drank gasoline for a doll.
[195:32.42]Doll.
[195:39.88]Kill the pig.
[195:47.71]Kill the pig.
[195:55.35]Another house over here.
[196:20.16]Can I get in?
[196:26.48]Can I get in?
[196:27.06]Metal door.
[196:28.17]This door seems to be blocked on the other side.
[196:32.71]No windows.
[196:34.43]Metal door.
[196:35.15]Locked.
[196:35.41]I need a key.
[196:42.67]Of course I do.
[196:48.83]I'm gonna head back to... Okay, I got a new thing on my map in that silent forest.
[196:59.91]Here is the shrine with the... Okay, the well was down here?
[197:05.03]Where was that well?
[197:05.81]Because last time I saw him, he was down the well!
[197:09.84]Well, he was, like, at the well.
[197:11.02]He's definitely down the well.
[197:12.48]He's definitely in the well, rotting.
[197:16.10]Right?
[197:20.09]I would think that's where he is.
[197:25.89]This is this side.
[197:27.69]Alright, down here, right?
[197:39.75]I still need a key.
[197:40.81]I'll probably get it later.
[197:47.48]Well, come on.
[197:51.87]Is this guy... He's pissed off.
[197:53.59]Here's the well.
[197:55.91]Well.
[197:57.85]I need the... Okay, I need like a chain or a... I need that.
[198:01.65]The guy sells it.
[198:03.39]Alright.
[198:04.15]I think I've exacerbated all options.
[198:08.01]It's time.
[198:10.75]There's this thing in... There's something in here, though.
[198:14.26]What should I do?
[198:17.16]Should I...
[198:20.05]So should I just like kill this person?
[198:27.88]I feel like I should just smash.
[198:39.20]I don't know.
[198:39.68]I don't know.
[198:46.03]There's no talking.
[198:57.70]Don't.
[198:58.10]No.
[198:58.52]Do it.
[199:00.56]I can't.
[199:01.06]I can't do it unless I know what's happening.
[199:02.82]I can't do it.
[199:06.28]I can't do it.
[199:08.84]I can't.
[199:10.06]It's time to leave.
[199:10.76]I need to come back here with one of those chains.
[199:17.33]Sorry, guys.
[199:19.59]I have to go back to the silent forest and look at that place that he told me to look.
[199:27.36]store these things that I have now.
[199:37.87]There's a chain in the village.
[199:42.98]A hundred essence?
[199:47.80]Uh... Let's do it.
[199:53.36]Pretty nice.
[199:55.24]Alright, I've got more of these things.
[199:57.55]What's this?
[199:57.87]Okay, scary.
[200:02.85]Doll.
[200:06.61]Chicken eggs, I can just eat them?
[200:11.20]Uh, the chicken head didn't do anything, by the way.
[200:12.76]Let's store this crap.
[200:18.90]Chicken head doesn't do shit.
[200:20.42]I'll keep the eggs.
[200:21.20]No, I'll get rid of them.
[200:23.36]Let's make another bandage.
[200:28.02]Upgrade item.
[200:29.34]I need... More... Just scrap.
[200:33.77]I was supposed to get a bunch of scrap.
[200:34.95]Alright, let's go find that new place that's marked on the map.
[200:37.91]Pig Shed.
[200:38.41]There it is.
[200:40.19]So I'm going to go up to Pig Shed.
[200:42.43]The day just started.
[200:53.33]I can go.
[200:53.93]I'm ready to move.
[200:56.01]I'm ready.
[200:57.43]Let's go.
[200:58.22]I've got a lockpick.
[200:59.12]I'm ready.
[200:59.60]Let's go to the shed.
[201:06.86]Because it's like 8 o'clock in the morning.
[201:09.12]I haven't even done anything.
[201:10.16]I've got peels.
[201:14.83]Wait, hold on.
[201:16.17]The electronic stuff.
[201:20.48]The guy that likes you to give him electronics.
[201:25.16]I don't really have any electronics to give this person.
[201:33.28]I mean, the steering wheel.
[201:38.92]Steering wheel, I'll bring a couple batteries.
[201:46.12]I guess.
[201:46.52]I mean, that's what I have.
[201:47.75]I want to keep the wires, though.
[201:54.95]Yeah, I'll give him the steering wheel.
[201:57.43]Right?
[201:58.63]I don't know.
[201:59.03]Let's go.
[202:03.79]Left.
[202:04.68]Up.
[202:11.30]Look at his blueprint.
[202:22.19]Tire.
[202:24.93]Tire, steering wheel, battery.
[202:29.89]Wait a minute.
[202:42.60]Tire, steering wheel, car battery.
[202:47.22]They're in a different place.
[202:59.51]Right?
[203:02.29]Is that the fan belt?
[203:05.87]Fan belt.
[203:07.01]It's somewhere else.
[203:10.58]It's over here.
[203:12.24]No.
[203:12.60]Where's the fan belt?
[203:15.16]Right there.
[203:17.34]What else does he need?
[203:20.86]Fan belt.
[203:22.22]Battery.
[203:23.20]This is like a muffler?
[203:24.64]And what is this?
[203:30.05]Muffler and an exhaust.
[203:31.15]I'm gonna find those.
[203:33.91]Alright, well, I can just give it to him now.
[203:35.50]Alright, let's go.
[203:35.96]I've got a gun.
[204:01.03]Oh, I could have saved a little bit of time if I went through the hole and then back... Yeah, you're right.
[204:04.21]I hear a mushroom.
[204:15.46]Always get the mushrooms.
[204:22.69]Don't forget the pig shed?
[204:23.47]Yeah, I'm gonna go left up.
[204:38.67]We're here.
[204:39.19]Gonna get this guy some of these materials.
[204:41.87]Watch it.
[204:42.17]There's an elk here.
[204:44.98]But you're in the way.
[204:45.80]I'm just gonna keep going left.
[204:46.78]Forget it.
[204:47.10]This is a weird poison forest.
[204:53.84]Just don't step in any poison and I'll be alright.
[204:59.64]Metal down here?
[205:01.57]No, this wood.
[205:02.31]I'll take it.
[205:02.89]Alright.
[205:08.20]Okay, I think I already did all this.
[205:10.58]No, I didn't get these.
[205:14.98]Damn it.
[205:16.06]This is not supposed to be a wood run.
[205:17.72]This is supposed to be a scrap metal run.
[205:19.44]Okay, here we go.
[205:28.65]This is great.
[205:32.83]Don't step on a mushroom.
[205:36.05]That is the house.
[205:39.13]I'm gonna wrap around here.
[205:39.99]Hi dude, I got some stuff for you.
[205:54.08]I have some materials that you're gonna want.
[206:00.40]Hi, show item.
[206:02.62]Okay, steering wheel.
[206:04.97]A trajectory guidance system.
[206:07.05]Wow, this will fit perfectly in my rocket.
[206:08.77]Have you seen it?
[206:09.87]Have you seen my rocket?
[206:10.91]It's almost as pretty as Gargarin's.
[206:13.19]Well, almost.
[206:14.60]I just need to find some parts and it'll be completely ready.
[206:17.28]Would you bring them to me, the other parts?
[206:18.58]I would love to fly to space and then to the moon and to Mars and Jupiter and the sun.
[206:23.62]I mean, I would land at night.

[207:03.68]And then, whee!
[207:04.50]Off I go!
[207:06.54]I'm receiving tons of shit.
[207:08.34]I will wave to you when I'm on my way to where no man's been before.
[207:12.55]Do you know the doctor?
[207:16.90]Maybe tomorrow, for example.
[207:17.62]I just need to find the screw for the cover Blueprints for the rocket
[207:43.80]Postcard with a portrait of a man.
[207:45.22]Oh, I have one too.
[207:45.99]Alright.
[207:50.55]I did it.
[207:51.79]But before you leave, what do you have here?
[208:13.22]Here's the chain.
[208:15.72]Cable.
[208:17.74]Chain.
[208:29.61]Couple of wires.
[208:33.09]I'm gonna just clean the guy out.
[208:33.93]He's gone.
[208:34.33]Map of the old woods.
[208:36.13]I should get this too.
[208:37.95]Get the flashlight.
[208:40.71]Flashlight, map.
[208:42.25]Now, what do I have to give you?
[208:43.39]Right, I was going to give you... Nothing.
[208:50.23]Get the flashlight.
[208:53.94]I need 200 reputation with him, though.
[209:00.96]Some of these have to go.
[209:06.90]Flashlight's too expensive.
[209:09.57]I could probably make one of these.
[209:17.09]get the military flashlight there's a free there's a chain in the village are we certain of that yes you're gonna have to point me in the direction where it is so now that leaves with I have the cable the military flashlight
[209:45.31]Oh, I was going to give you a couple of batteries.
[209:46.97]That's what it was.
[209:48.29]That's what it was.
[209:49.43]But I'm going to... No, I don't want you to give me that now.
[209:53.69]He gave me weapon parts?
[209:55.54]Wait a minute.
[209:56.08]Okay, this is important.
[209:58.16]I'm going to give you a healer.
[210:02.96]Because... And, I don't know, a fucking log.
[210:09.32]Don't want that.
[210:09.90]A torch.
[210:10.94]A torch.
[210:21.85]Normal is better than military.
[210:28.56]This is going to be a fight in chat here, I think.
[210:33.10]Why is military more expensive?
[210:35.24]That seems odd.
[210:45.77]Military is brighter, but uses way too many batteries.
[210:56.59]I'm going to do the regular one.
[211:03.27]Did it.
[211:06.93]It's done.
[211:26.96]It's done.
[211:31.70]Five nails.
[211:35.78]No, should I... Nails?
[211:39.36]I wish I had enough for this.
[211:40.82]Map of the old woods.
[211:44.44]I want it.
[211:45.34]I want it.
[211:45.82]I want it.
[211:47.08]I want this.
[211:47.92]I don't care if it sucks.
[211:49.22]I want it.
[211:56.47]How many do I need?
[211:57.05]40 more points.
[211:59.99]I can do that with a torch.
[212:03.13]Sell the batteries?
[212:03.83]No, now I need the batteries.
[212:04.83]Because I have a flashlight now.
[212:10.29]Here, take a bandage.
[212:12.19]60, 780, 92.
[212:13.03]No, I need that torch.
[212:18.90]No, I don't.
[212:19.30]Here, take this shitty torch.
[212:21.50]No.
[212:22.14]Alright, take it.
[212:23.88]Give it.
[212:25.82]Done.
[212:33.52]Okay.
[212:35.80]Thank you.
[212:36.90]It's been a pleasure.
[212:39.08]Goodbye.
[212:45.12]Now I have to go up to the pig shed.
[212:54.81]I think I should go back.
[212:59.31]Oh, I just am so conflicted on what I want to do right now.
[213:01.89]Alright, map of the woods.
[213:04.38]Church ruins.
[213:09.06]Church ruins.
[213:13.08]Oh, shit.
[213:13.50]Okay.
[213:14.80]There's a hydrant up there.
[213:15.58]Alright, I'm just going to keep doing what I was doing.
[213:21.67]I'm going right up to the pig shed.
[213:26.86]No, that's too dangerous.
[213:28.82]I have all kinds of cool stuff now.
[213:30.42]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm going back.
[213:35.53]I'm going back and we're gonna take the super runner.
[213:37.91]Let's do it.
[213:42.79]Poison.
[214:07.12]Ugh.
[214:09.46]Alright.
[214:10.98]I'm gonna... I don't even know what I'm doing.
[214:16.51]I get very easily overwhelmed in games like these.
[214:20.17]Because when you have a finite amount of time to do something, and the game tells you to do like ten things at the same time, I get overwhelmed.
[214:29.02]It's very simple for me to just lose concentration completely.
[214:38.13]I really like this game, though.
[214:39.25]It's very fun.
[214:42.75]It's very interesting.
[214:43.51]Is there... No.
[214:51.05]So I am in my possession.
[214:52.89]I have... I can now upgrade the workbench.
[215:00.61]A sickle?
[215:01.23]I can make armor after this.
[215:05.71]Single shot, shotgun...
[215:08.50]Alright.
[215:09.54]I need more scrap, which is the point of the entire mission that I went on.
[215:16.47]What's going on?
[215:18.45]I have to make these into wooden planks.
[215:21.67]Let's go ahead and deposit them all.
[215:30.40]And... Put more gas in there, but I'll just take them.
[215:41.35]I'll cook the mushrooms that I got.
[215:47.88]So, the flashlight now takes the place of the torch, so I do not need torches anymore ever again.
[215:53.80]Technically.
[215:55.40]Right?
[215:58.04]Technically speaking.
[216:04.41]Make sure I get all the wood out of here so I can compile it.
[216:08.67]Wrong, okay?
[216:10.03]I have a lot of batteries.
[216:14.24]Okay, no more wood or wooden planks.
[216:16.58]Let's go fill this up.
[216:20.93]Go get the chain.
[216:21.81]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, don't worry.
[216:24.27]I'm gonna get the chain.
[216:25.09]Get out of here.
[216:25.45]What are you doing?
[216:52.98]Generate this is still fine, but I'll top it off.
[216:59.16]Alright, let's put the rest of the wood that's in here.
[217:05.09]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[217:07.83]I now have more wood than I know what to do with.
[217:11.75]Good.
[217:15.48]Turn around.
[217:22.35]Okay, at least... Okay, now I gotta get my wood pile here.
[217:25.41]Batteries.
[217:27.71]These eggs, I don't know.
[217:29.37]Stones, it's time to just remove them completely.
[217:31.65]Just get rid of them.
[217:33.89]I have no reason to have these stones.
[217:36.63]Zero.
[217:39.31]They don't do a damn thing for me.
[217:42.20]They're just here.
[217:46.86]Weapon parts.
[217:52.51]Put the batteries away.
[217:53.91]Put the welder away until I can actually use it.
[218:01.49]Don't turn that on.
[218:02.29]Alright, I'm getting rid of the rocks.
[218:05.96]And then I should be good to... Where are those rocks?
[218:39.75]Oh my god, give me a break.
[218:45.62]It's like a super dog!
[218:46.82]Holy shit, he's gonna kill me!
[218:52.78]Dead huge dog!
[218:55.86]Cookable meat, what?
[219:00.78]Alright, I'm gonna do the bug thing.
[219:02.00]The moth thing.
[219:08.92]How much is this worth?
[219:12.31]60.
[219:12.41]Nice.
[219:15.85]Alright.
[219:20.41]I'm just... I'll throw them on the ground.
[219:23.12]At this stage of the game.
[219:24.32]I'm gonna put... just throw them over here.
[219:30.86]If there's any stupid reason why I need them, they're all over here.
[219:43.75]Like, if there's a dumb reason for them to be needed.
[219:53.20]Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well. Build the well.
[220:01.19]Wait!
[220:05.59]I just need the chain.
[220:06.63]Okay, build the well.
[220:08.15]Build the well.
[220:17.17]Scrap.
[220:19.20]Itchy inside of my ear.
[220:20.36]That means like a ghost is in the room, right?
[220:23.38]I know that means something weird.
[220:24.66]There's like a ghost in here.
[220:28.84]Just like when you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you.
[220:32.27]Alright, uh, build the well.
[220:43.47]I need to heal.
[220:48.60]No, that's if your ears get red.
[220:50.15]Dumb dumb.
[220:53.55]Okay, we're looking for near the chicken lady's hut.
[220:57.61]There is a person who is on fire, who is burned.
[221:08.68]Where is this person?
[221:13.32]There's a burnt corpse over here somewhere.
[221:17.64]Okay.

[222:11.49]I see you between the trees.
[222:16.40]You will not squeeze between them.
[222:20.48]I would use these next words more carefully if I were you.
[222:28.72]I didn't even say the line right.
[222:30.08]I leaned in for it.
[222:36.31]Who are you?

[224:42.91]And then they just said, I'm melting.
[224:44.41]Okay, I'll listen to that person.
[224:50.74]He said it needs to be done.
[224:54.34]It will help, he said.
[224:55.36]I don't understand.
[225:06.17]Do I have to do that?
[225:07.63]What a foul stench.
[225:57.51]Its arms and legs are bound with a chain.
[226:01.28]Bingo.
[226:03.98]Oven.
[226:05.22]Nothing in the oven.
[226:05.96]Time to fix the wall.
[226:27.61]Keep the patient warm.
[226:28.88]Yeah, that's fucked up.
[226:32.16]Alright, did that.
[226:32.88]Alright.
[226:34.46]You're not... He's not under here anymore.

[226:46.07]Nah, it's frozen.
[226:46.63]It's fine.
[226:49.79]Take a bandage.
[226:50.51]No, I should just stand next to a light and do the moth.
[226:55.81]Alright, can I activate Moth and then shine the light in my face?
[226:59.87]For the flashlight?
[227:00.51]I feel like I should be able to do that.
[227:11.33]I need a lamp or something.
[227:23.44]Ah, I'm not going in here.
[227:28.22]Use the well, you dipshit.
[227:34.04]I was going to see if there was a light up there.
[227:36.58]What's with everybody with this well?
[227:41.74]By the way, I looked into it.
[227:43.83]Full moon is in like two days.
[227:47.93]Just saying.
[228:00.42]Gonna heal.
[228:06.69]There's gonna be something down here.
[228:07.61]Should I go with the gun?
[228:09.75]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[228:13.48]This is gonna be like a boss fight.
[228:25.69]Okay, there's a return to the surface, search, torch, and a flare.
[228:33.35]It's gonna get dark in here.
[228:43.15]Oh boy, that's a good thing I have the flashlight.
[228:57.59]What the hell is scribbled on the ground?
[229:03.48]Is it like a scorpion?
[229:04.68]I hear somebody walking around.
[229:35.73]What is this?
[229:37.87]Super mushroom.
[229:43.88]Oh, God.
[230:07.34]Do I have batteries?
[230:10.44]Nope.
[230:32.55]There's a key down here.
[230:33.69]Just find the key before running out of power and light.
[230:42.00]And I'm going to take out this gun.
[230:43.94]If there's a monster down here, this is a gun scenario.
[230:51.95]If it is anything besides those guys with the halberds, this is a gun scenario.
[231:07.84]This is a gun scenario.
[231:08.90]Gun?
[231:09.34]Gun scenario?
[231:10.68]This is a gun scenario!
[231:12.30]No, it's not.
[231:14.95]This thing is little.
[231:24.85]I can't see.
[231:25.17]I'm gonna wait till he turns the corner and I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.
[232:00.07]Fuck outta here.
[232:02.85]Let's go.
[232:05.72]Heal.
[232:31.55]Where is it?
[232:32.01]It's over here.
[232:44.00]Nice 90's voice actor dub!
[232:52.18]Get over here before this burns out!
[233:08.50]Where the fuck is it?
[233:12.41]It's done.
[234:47.77]It's you.
[235:09.75]Another doll.
[235:10.65]Odd meat.
[235:21.04]No, don't throw this.
[235:22.42]Okay.
[235:36.72]Where's this key that exists down here, apparently?
[236:09.51]And the music's getting louder.
[236:12.75]Why?
[236:13.15]There's so many mushrooms here.
[236:30.79]What is this?
[236:32.27]Return to the...
[236:34.38]What?
[236:37.10]Wait.
[236:38.74]I made it?
[236:44.37]I did it!
[236:49.09]Where the hell am I?
[237:03.12]Is he breathing?
[237:19.84]How do I get the hell out of here?
[237:29.64]Dog tag.
[237:32.70]McCull, McCull, K. Couple of eggs.
[237:43.86]Plastic chickens.
[237:46.40]More eggs and some bread.
[238:06.61]So many eggs.
[238:11.09]Key covered in chicken feces.
[238:16.90]Oh, shit.
[238:18.42]Okay, um...
[238:50.84]Where does that key go?
[238:53.66]I got the- I got the key.
[239:25.62]So now I have this chicken key.
[239:29.84]Which, yeah, that's the thing that the wolfman wanted.
[239:33.26]I know what we're doing tomorrow.
[239:42.71]Or the music kid.
[239:45.07]This is a choice we have to make.
[239:47.95]I'm not sure what to do.
[239:50.92]Nice oblivion NPC face.
[239:57.07]I can just open the door.
[239:59.87]Should I just open the door?
[240:00.81]What if I just go in?
[240:15.71]What if I just go in the room?
[240:22.72]Said the little hen with an odd little shrug.
[240:24.16]I wish I could find a fat little bug.
[240:25.76]Upon seeing you, the old lady stops humming.
[240:27.16]What do you want?
[240:27.74]I thought I was going to try to show her the key.
[240:31.38]And be like, ha ha.
[240:38.82]Alright, I'm going to do the thing.
[240:46.20]I'm going to give the key to... I'm going to give the key to the wolfman.
[240:55.65]Just look in there first.
[241:01.29]Use it first?
[241:02.37]Shouldn't I... Should I not do this?
[241:07.08]Go in the room.
[241:08.30]You sure?
[241:08.66]Alright, I'll do it.
[241:09.86]I'm going in.
[241:12.26]Going in.
[241:12.96]Going in.
[241:15.00]Going in.
[241:19.02]He said don't.
[241:23.32]Mothman said don't do it.
[241:31.04]Wolfman said don't do it.
[241:35.10]But what's behind the door?
[241:52.13]It's up to me now.
[242:08.77]I'm not gonna do it.
[242:09.95]I'm gonna go give the key to the Wolfman.
[242:12.01]But that doesn't mean I'm not going to bash the old lady's head in.
[242:14.85]Kidding.
[242:25.97]Friendship with Wolfman secured.
[242:36.12]You can do both.
[242:38.21]I don't know how accurate that is though, because every time I go towards the door... Okay, the door is hot.
[242:45.62]There's a fire behind that door.
[242:47.46]And it's you guys.
[242:49.22]Half of you are in front of the door trying to open it, and the other half of you are creating heat to not open the door.
[242:56.46]So... I'm walking up to the door and it's like fucking fire.
[243:00.28]Don't open the door!
[243:02.04]I'm gonna burn my hand!
[243:02.94]And then everybody behind me is trying to push me to get me to touch the door.
[243:05.30]I'm gonna burn my hand if I touch the door.
[243:11.53]When I walked up to the door, it was like a sea of don't.
[243:14.93]Don't do it.
[243:15.55]He said, don't do it.
[243:16.46]Please don't do it.
[243:17.44]And then I'm like, okay, I'm going to back off.
[243:18.86]You fucking wuss.
[243:21.40]You're the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life.
[243:24.92]And then the fucking door cools down.
[243:26.82]And I'm like, okay, I walk towards the door again and it turns red.
[243:29.84]Again.
[243:31.74]I don't know what to do.
[243:33.08]I don't know what to do.
[243:33.66]No, no, I'm not going to do it.
[243:35.58]I'm going to go to the wolf.
[243:37.08]Because the wolf gave me a specific task.
[243:40.09]And it was to do this.
[243:41.43]So we're going to the wolf's camp up here.
[243:43.57]That's what we're doing.
[243:46.51]That is the plan.
[243:49.83]You're going to regret it.
[243:51.61]Well, then that's my own fault.
[243:55.16]Oh god.
[243:56.00]It's 17.
[243:56.72]Alright.
[243:58.84]I didn't get any scrap.
[244:07.90]Oh, dear.
[244:08.76]Wait, I have a lot of things to cook.
[244:10.12]40, 40, 40, 40.
[244:14.37]48.
[244:14.41]40, 40, 40, 40, 40.
[244:14.55]4,800 points!
[244:15.03]Hmm.
[244:42.20]Acid base?
[244:46.92]Yeah, I like it better.
[244:48.74]What is this?
[244:49.10]It's just an eagle eye thing.
[244:50.12]Who cares?
[244:52.35]Acid base.
[245:01.71]Uh, nothing else I can cook, right?
[245:04.08]That doesn't matter right now.
[245:05.14]What matters is you boarding up some doors.
[245:11.61]like right now like why are you still sitting here like this I don't know why I'm still standing here I need to board up doors why am I still like sitting here okay
[245:44.45]Close this.
[245:46.00]I still have a trap.
[245:46.86]This is scrap.
[245:48.76]I have no more traps.
[245:55.58]Thankfully, my shovel's still good.
[246:00.16]What about down here?
[246:03.63]This is alright still?
[246:04.73]Yep.
[246:06.65]Barricade this door.
[246:07.55]Good.
[246:15.01]Good.
[246:17.02]Broken glass is still there.
[246:20.22]Move this sofa just a little bit.
[246:21.68]A lot of it matters.
[246:26.62]And then I'm going to put a trap on this wall over here.
[246:29.24]I have a chain trap.
[246:31.92]There it is.
[246:33.06]Get it on here.
[246:36.60]Lay it like right here.
[246:42.74]Move the trap.
[246:43.40]What are you talking about?
[246:47.50]Here we go.
[246:51.52]Is he really going to say acid base and not play it?
[246:55.53]Yeah, I think.
[246:56.37]I have heals?
[247:09.96]No.
[247:12.16]I'm really prepared here with no heals.
[247:15.98]That just means I can't get hit.
[247:19.04]Wait, no, I do have a heal.
[247:21.10]I've got the moth.
[247:24.72]Play the damn song.
[247:28.16]I can't.
[247:29.22]I cannot alt-tab.
[247:30.68]No, I've got to focus on this.
[247:32.49]And then I've got to give the wolf the key.
[247:35.53]Just don't get hit.
[247:36.37]I know, it's not hard.
[247:38.61]It actually is kind of hard.
[247:49.39]Here, okay.
[247:50.55]I will make the 16 people that spammed this link in chat happy.
[247:55.01]I will.
[247:55.37]Because I'm a pleaser.
[247:57.07]I'm a crowd pleaser.
[247:59.29]That's what you're going to get.
[248:06.37]And it's not a crowd pleaser.
[248:07.39]There's 4,000 people here and like 20 people want me to play this.
[248:10.47]So this is actually not me pleasing the crowd.
[248:12.15]This is me pleasing a few people.
[248:16.47]I'm not even a crowd pleaser.
[248:22.94]You're a gaggle pleaser.
[249:09.00]Here they come!
[249:37.49]This sucks because... Does this not do anything?
[250:26.49]Front door, where?
[250:27.20]I think it's over here again.
[250:41.56]Is it?
[250:48.04]There's no autoplay on, by the way.
[250:50.58]You know something funny about that video?
[250:53.20]The... One of the recommended videos after that in the nine, like, Hollywood Squares stuff, you know, like the nine thumbnails, is JermaCraft Episode 1.
[251:05.31]What does this mean?
[251:12.22]What's going on?
[251:14.12]Somebody's spawning in here.
[251:19.06]What do I do about this?
[251:20.26]I need some backseat gaming.
[251:22.72]What is that?
[251:23.92]Backseat gaming.
[251:24.94]What is it?
[251:25.90]What do I do?
[251:26.28]Don't look at it?
[251:27.14]Backseat gaming.
[251:30.92]Don't look into it.
[251:35.86]Should I get out of the room?
[251:36.52]Is it gonna explode?
[251:37.16]Should I get out of the room?
[251:38.82]Let's get out of the room.
[251:40.90]I wanna get out of the room, yes.
[251:48.78]I stepped in a trap!
[251:50.68]I stepped in the trap and then the sofa
[252:18.19]blocked me from leaving the room.
[252:29.25]Can you imagine somebody barricading up themselves in a fucking room?
[252:36.50]First of all.
[252:37.88]Second of all, somebody like rolls a grenade in the room.
[252:42.04]And then the person goes, there's like, let's say there's like six or seven other people in that room.
[252:47.38]Hey!
[252:48.96]Should we run out of the room?
[252:50.31]I think we should probably run out of this room!
[252:52.31]Let's run out of the room!
[252:53.31]And then that person sprints directly into a trap that they put up.
[252:57.17]They step into a bear trap that they assemble.
[253:01.27]And then a fucking monster comes in and pushes the sofa directly into them.
[253:06.07]And they get locked with the bear trap on their foot.
[253:09.38]Still against the wall.
[253:10.94]Well, at least, you know, the other six or seven of you could leave.
[253:17.39]Like you're just raring to go.
[253:18.69]Like you're waiting at the Olympics for the guy to shoot the gun in the air to start running into the trap.
[253:25.29]At least whoever else is in that room could easily get out.
[253:42.98]I put these traps here.
[253:49.17]Get out of the fucking room my only the wires the copper wires or whatever the fiber optic wires that connect it from my This part of my brain to this part of my brain was just get out as fast as possible Just run in a straight line to the door.
[254:10.10]I Don't what is that thing what what why did somebody drop like a gas grenade in the room?
[254:13.93]What is that?
[254:25.60]How did this even get over here?
[254:26.78]Alright, this is not... That's what happens when you play Left 4 Dead like that, by the way.
[254:34.44]I just did the thing where everybody goes into the bathroom.
[254:38.05]And if you've never played Left 4 Dead, that seems like a great idea.
[254:42.54]Hey, all of us go in the bathroom, and then all the special infected just find you, and the boomers blow up right outside the door, the smokers just grabbing people, the tank is getting in there, everyone just gets in the bathroom.
[254:56.51]And then everybody dies.
[254:57.19]I admit, what a fun game.
[255:00.07]Oh, generator.
[255:03.77]Well, now I have to make another door.
[255:13.91]Alright.
[255:15.55]You have a 9-volt brain.
[255:17.05]Get out of here.
[255:25.75]Whatever.
[255:26.77]Okay, so I have... Why do I only have 5... Oh, I died.
[255:29.14]Right.
[255:37.04]So, I need another scrap, and then I can upgrade the workshop again.
[255:42.88]So, this is a scrap day only.
[255:46.62]We're going to go talk to the wolf and it's a scrap day only.
[256:02.31]Yeah, everybody runs out of ammo.
[256:04.35]If you do the bathroom strategy.
[256:07.03]And then somebody has to go try to find a weapon.
[256:13.05]Okay, here we go.
[256:16.05]Scrap only.
[256:16.81]I'm gonna keep the pills.
[256:19.29]Deposit the scrap.
[256:20.15]I'll keep the potatoes.
[256:21.77]I will take a couple of batteries with me.
[256:24.40]Flashlight can stay.
[256:26.30]Torch can stay in emergency situations only.
[256:29.70]Wood goes back.
[256:30.40]Bottle goes back.
[256:31.76]Potato stays.
[256:32.58]Alright, let's go.
[256:38.48]Alright, buddy.
[256:40.52]I'm gonna move out of here.
[256:41.48]This is a scrap run.
[256:44.34]Go to the wolf's camp.
[256:48.50]Let's go.
[256:55.25]Do I have any heals?
[256:57.45]You don't.
[256:58.19]Yes, you do.
[256:58.63]I'll be fine.
[257:08.46]Somebody said I should go do the other stuff in this woods first, or I lock myself out of it.
[257:19.13]I lock myself out of doing this stuff again.
[257:22.65]So what were the other quests I had?
[257:31.40]I don't remember anything besides... The pig farm.
[257:38.68]right right let's just head over there I need to get scrap to upgrade and I needed to make traps and everything
[258:18.37]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[258:19.59]I feel like this is an important place.
[258:33.24]I might as well look at it.
[258:36.78]There's the gramophone.
[258:50.80]oh he's in here the boy stops playing and lowers his head avoiding my sight
[259:14.40]Have you heard about the sow?
[259:15.76]The villagers keep the sow in the nearby pig shed.
[259:18.86]They call it the mother of all pigs.
[259:22.04]They say it's beautiful, but I've never seen it.
[259:24.50]They don't allow me near her.
[259:25.61]They chase me off.
[259:26.53]They always chase me off.
[259:28.99]Maybe you would be able to see her, mister.
[259:30.91]If you manage to get inside, maybe you could take a wee piece of meat from me.
[259:37.65]Should I show them?
[259:38.19]Should I show them the key?
[259:45.17]Wait, that... No.
[259:50.21]Okay, I'll get you some meat.
[259:53.89]Pig shit.
[259:56.09]Let's go.
[259:56.39]Alright.
[260:23.71]Wow.
[260:25.37]You improved.
[260:27.25]Right when I walked out.
[260:29.24]You're just hiding the fact that you're not very good at the violin.
[260:31.50]Is that a big dog?
[260:33.76]Yeah, this is a meat dog, I think.
[261:04.36]Yes.
[261:05.02]Yes, I'm wearing a bathing suit, okay?
[261:07.30]It's laundry day.
[261:08.94]Fuck.
[261:18.93]Those dogs suck.
[261:21.55]Those dogs are ridiculous.
[261:22.56]You can't dodge those.
[261:27.25]I have to shoot that dog.
[261:28.41]That is ridiculous.
[261:36.05]That's ridiculous.
[261:45.16]You just suck.
[261:46.50]Dodging only goes backwards and it just... That's not, no, no.
[261:50.18]The big dogs, no.
[261:51.80]I am not going to hear that from you guys today.
[261:54.79]I'm not gonna hear that from you guys today.
[261:57.03]That thing was ridiculous.
[261:59.32]I ain't gonna hear that from you today.
[262:12.70]Just kill it.
[262:14.75]I've worn bathing suits as clothes outside.
[262:17.23]You're good.
[262:18.03]I know.
[262:20.36]Am I supposed to be embarrassed at the fact that I'm wearing a bathing suit?
[262:22.68]They're light.
[262:24.17]They're very thin.
[262:25.73]And they do complete coverage.
[262:27.23]What's the problem?
[262:31.97]I'm incredibly comfortable right now.
[262:34.95]Okay.
[262:37.01]I'm going back.
[262:37.71]I need to repair.
[262:38.51]Can I repair this?
[262:39.24]I need to repair this.
[262:43.56]This dog is dead.
[262:44.40]And I'm going to get my shit back.
[262:48.87]Those are worse than Dark Souls dogs.
[263:06.00]Yeah, they're the mega dogs, because they have a thing that they drop that's like a hundred essence.
[263:12.07]I'm sorry, I ain't gonna have somebody tell me that dying to the mega dog is bad.
[263:16.53]It's a mega dog.
[263:18.32]And I'm gonna hit it in the face.
[263:46.58]Done.
[263:48.06]Whatever.
[263:57.51]Did the guy just punch that thing to kill it?
[264:01.07]He just punched it once!
[264:04.90]Holy shit, this guy's ridiculous.
[264:09.30]That's free antlers for me.
[264:22.10]Alright.
[264:23.10]Let's go.
[264:24.76]Poison.
[264:27.17]Then we go up.
[264:30.25]I need metal.
[264:32.55]Metal.
[264:33.59]Metal.
[264:42.97]Round two, dog.
[264:45.15]Super dog.
[264:54.73]Okay, we've already been here.
[264:56.72]Go up.
[264:59.86]To the pig shed.
[265:02.18]Try middle mouse.
[265:04.34]I have it on my other mouse, but yeah, I do it sometimes.
[265:07.70]It takes way too much stamina for me.
[265:13.61]Look, this takes more than half a bar of stamina.
[265:18.53]Look at that.
[265:19.19]What are you talking about?

[270:53.51]What should I do with this skateboard?
[270:54.67]Alright.
[270:58.82]I don't have any heals.
[271:04.49]What's in there?

[271:23.52]It's late at night.
[271:25.30]It's time to- I have to get out of this.
[271:27.36]It's late.
[271:27.82]Look what time it is.
[272:00.75]The door's blocked from the other side.
[272:02.35]How did I get in here?
[272:03.27]Oh, whoa.
[272:08.32]This is bad.
[272:29.27]I'm in trouble.
[272:31.23]I'm in big trouble.
[272:35.62]Get away from me.
[272:36.24]I don't want to fight anybody.
[272:38.64]Get away from me.
[273:05.15]No, get... I didn't get any scrap.
[273:27.59]This is terrible.
[273:31.33]What's this?
[273:35.12]I should know that's gonna happen by now.
[273:36.48]Why do I not know that's gonna happen?
[273:58.55]I just didn't- I don't care.
[273:59.53]I have to go.

[274:22.96]Quickly.
[274:23.46]Just dump it in there.
[274:24.14]I'll figure it out later.
[274:25.09]I can figure this out tomorrow.
[274:34.59]Ah!
[275:32.92]That's fine.
[275:35.48]We're good.
[275:36.26]Okay.
[275:39.52]Do I... Eat a potato?
[275:45.34]Alright.
[275:46.40]I'm gonna use the pitchfork.
[275:48.60]For melee.
[275:52.30]Why are these over here?
[275:53.19]This should be over here.
[276:11.85]Okay.
[276:13.17]Couch.
[276:18.36]No, keep it here.
[276:22.44]I'm ready for you.
[276:37.47]Don't use the pitchfork.
[276:38.35]It sucks.
[276:38.93]Well, if I don't use the pitchfork...
[276:41.72]Then I'm going to break the shovel.
[277:02.52]Wow, what's the swing animation?
[277:05.16]That's not very good.
[277:06.36]Okay, that's a full front stab.
[277:18.16]Check the left window.
[277:19.76]It's alright.
[277:23.76]Why am I moving?
[277:36.18]I should not be moving.
[277:44.40]I might just take the gun out.
[277:48.20]I'm gonna sell the pitchforks, but I'm... I think I'm just gonna use the gun.
[278:02.03]The gun's gonna break.
[278:04.69]Prep to front, stab.
[278:05.72]That's what I was thinking.
[278:13.58]Okay, here comes our first visitor of the night.
[278:16.06]Left side.
[278:16.50]I'm going to stand up here so he gets in the trap.
[278:20.44]So he actually comes through and lands in the trap.
[278:36.74]Is the red durability not ammo?
[278:38.14]Oh, it's definitely ammo.
[278:42.26]Where's the crows?
[279:17.88]Something over here.
[279:18.56]There's something in here.
[279:37.78]Why is it not... It's not... What the fuck is going on over here?
[279:54.64]What's this?
[279:55.70]Why is this...
[280:21.38]Just don't move.
[280:21.74]Run and gun.
[280:22.00]Walk towards it.
[280:22.32]No.
[280:51.26]Why did I do that?
[280:52.24]Why am I moving at all?
[280:53.25]I have two hours.
[280:57.33]Take a quick peek.
[280:58.13]There's something right behind this door.
[281:03.43]Thank God it's boarded up.
[281:04.51]I'm safe.
[281:37.73]Day 16.
[281:46.44]Nice!
[281:55.82]Another day!
[281:58.96]Now... I need to go back to here.
[282:02.63]They mentioned the word... They mentioned the word cable.
[282:07.77]I'm going to probably assume that I need to bring the cable.
[282:17.82]Now, what exactly do I want to get rid of here?
[282:25.76]These pitchforks, I don't think I'm gonna use.
[282:29.53]I might keep one of them though, just in case I need it for something.
[282:34.45]Repair the shovel.
[282:41.91]Let me see the upgrade here.
[282:44.83]I need three more scrap.
[282:47.51]I think he sells them.
[282:50.17]Here we go.
[282:52.42]Nice.
[282:56.12]Go to where the thing was.
[282:57.66]Oh, I will?
[282:59.92]Alright, workbench upgrade.
[283:05.88]Exploding barrel?
[283:07.72]Axe.
[283:10.88]Simple shotgun.
[283:11.94]Light armor.
[283:12.82]Okay, this is where I start to figure out how I'm going to do this.
[283:16.44]Gas bottle.
[283:20.23]Okay, I know.
[283:21.91]Don't I have one of these somewhere?
[283:22.99]I think they have one.
[283:28.75]Do you have one?
[283:34.26]Yeah, you have one.
[283:39.05]I'm gonna sell... Is it... Do I have it stored?
[283:42.29]I might have one stored somewhere.
[283:43.51]I don't have anything to cook, right?
[283:46.48]No.
[283:48.74]Yeah, we're gonna do the... We're gonna go for the big pig.
[283:50.54]Battery... Shoes?
[283:56.36]I don't remember those.
[284:02.20]What else did I have here?
[284:03.26]Tape.
[284:05.16]Take that out now.
[284:07.64]There's room now in the inventory.
[284:11.11]Put on some shoes.
[284:14.27]Yeah, this can all come out now.
[284:15.61]I don't have to store this everywhere and have it haphazard.
[284:20.19]I can stay.
[284:24.80]Alright, let's clean this up.
[284:37.50]No scrap for this.
[284:43.87]Let's make some molotovs.
[284:49.85]I've got plenty of alcohol.
[284:51.50]Alcohol and a rag.
[284:57.02]I'm gonna make, like... Make a molotov.
[285:00.46]I need rags in the bug shells.
[285:06.12]Keep the batteries.
[285:06.88]I need to... Keep the lockpick.
[285:18.55]Sell the antlers.
[285:19.69]Bring the cable.
[285:25.19]I still don't know if I need this for anything. ...
[285:38.80]I'll just eat it before I run away.
[285:41.14]Lockpick.
[285:41.64]Don't need the tape.
[285:43.64]Restore the bottle.
[285:44.46]Restore this mirror.
[285:46.28]Whatever the hell this is for.
[285:48.78]Flashlight up here.
[285:50.78]Molotov.
[285:51.76]Antlers.
[285:52.20]Get rid of them.
[285:52.86]Watch.
[285:53.28]Battery.
[285:54.42]Shovel that is being depleted.
[285:57.00]Torch.
[285:58.02]Don't need it.
[285:58.48]I have the light.
[285:59.20]I got batteries.
[286:01.52]Eat that potato.
[286:02.94]Cable.
[286:03.30]Alright.
[286:07.54]The axe needs an axe head and a stick.
[286:15.73]First of all... You sell an axe head.
[286:20.92]And I know there's a stick outside.
[286:25.60]210.
[286:25.62]I can't get this right now.
[286:33.38]But I'm going to bring the pitchfork and use it.
[286:35.84]Shovel and... If I have to, I'll use it.
[286:41.80]I don't need the toolbox anymore?
[286:44.20]Is the toolbox useless?
[286:49.74]Have I... Sell the toolbox, you won't need it anymore.
[286:51.90]Really?
[287:01.91]So this is useless to me?
[287:10.71]Alright, yeah, I'll sell it.
[287:12.19]If that's the case, yeah.
[287:15.01]I guess I'll just bring all the potatoes.
[287:18.83]Check upgrade workshop.
[287:21.39]Yeah, I need like a pair of pliers and some wire.
[287:27.93]So I need to do the pliers before I can do the axe anyways.
[287:34.99]I just need scrap metal.
[287:35.97]That's really all it comes down to.
[287:36.85]Yeah, I can't craft it yet.
[287:40.41]Alright, so I'm gonna... I don't need to do this yet.
[287:43.35]What I am going to do is I'm gonna make a couple... I'm gonna make one more lockpick.
[287:47.04]I'm gonna make a couple bandages.
[287:48.42]Does it get self-rags?
[287:51.22]I guess I could bring out... No, I'll bring out these pills.
[287:53.96]Might as well.
[287:57.61]I have a lot of reputation with this dude.
[288:13.30]Right?
[288:14.44]Not bad.
[288:15.70]Not a bad idea.
[288:16.32]What are we doing?
[288:17.00]Okay.
[288:33.86]I already have enough tape.
[288:36.08]Let's get these rags.
[288:39.73]And let's get a wire.
[288:40.59]Okay.
[288:49.24]So now I need another wire.
[288:51.12]I need both your wires because I want another lockpick.
[288:53.28]I'm probably going to need it.
[289:04.57]And then I'll make another, uh, another gauze.
[289:08.81]Good.
[289:09.29]Three molotovs, which will go down here.
[289:13.82]Can only stack these in twos?
[289:15.58]Why?
[289:17.52]Battery for the light.
[289:19.02]How do I use this?
[289:20.29]Will it just automatically consume it from my inventory?
[289:28.45]Maybe.
[289:28.69]Alright, I'm ready.
[289:31.31]Let's go try to do something with that.
[289:32.51]I got the cable here.
[289:33.29]Let's do something with the pig.
[289:34.26]Here we go.
[289:39.38]All the way to the left.
[289:40.12]Let's do it.
[289:40.68]And then it's time to give the key to the wolf.
[289:43.76]Let's go.
[289:53.01]Let's eat potato and run.
[290:11.40]What a good use of the potato.
[290:14.42]Walking through this stupid poison thing.
[290:16.38]I'm just gonna eat another one, too.
[290:35.65]Cover more ground.
[290:39.47]How do I like the game so far?
[290:40.43]I think it's great.
[290:41.69]It's very fun.
[290:45.25]I've not... I've not decided that it was time to stop playing it.
[290:51.29]Does anybody know... I'm sure a lot of people here have already played this.
[290:54.23]Hold on.
[290:54.61]I need to concentrate here.
[290:58.14]How far am I into the game?
[291:00.76]Like, after doing this.
[291:02.72]Going up here.
[291:03.82]Oh, shit!
[291:05.82]Everybody quiet, quiet.
[291:06.70]Everybody don't move.
[291:26.89]That thing sucks.
[291:37.19]Use gun?
[291:37.99]Not unless I'm absolutely necessary.
[291:39.75]Okay, let's go.
[291:43.15]How much?
[291:43.41]What, am I halfway?
[291:44.06]That's cool.
[291:56.77]Alright, here we are again.
[292:02.41]Now I need to get back around, and then I've got a cable now.
[292:11.76]I'm a 2% Andy.
[292:12.68]What?
[292:13.30]Alright.
[292:23.45]Alright.
[292:31.23]I have to be ready for this, so now... I'm gonna go up here and through this.
[292:41.44]I'm still on the starting island?
[292:44.46]Well, thanks for ruining the whole game for me, because you just said I'm on an island, apparently.
[292:47.50]I didn't know that.
[292:48.12]Thanks for ruining the whole game.
[292:49.04]Alright, let me get this right.
[293:02.23]I have the pitchfork still.
[293:04.39]Get out of the way!
[293:34.96]Container full of... Where is it?
[293:40.44]It's rotten.
[294:13.31]Got it.
[294:14.47]Eat.
[294:54.28]What?
[294:54.68]What do I do with the cable?
[294:57.66]But... How do I get out there?
[295:37.77]I think the cable's over there, so I have to go around and go... How do I get to the cable?
[295:44.45]Oh, shit.
[295:45.37]I have to go all the way out.
[295:50.42]And all the way around.
[296:14.47]Eat another potato, for fuck's sake.
[296:24.55]Still on the starting planet.
[296:27.13]LOL.
[296:28.82]That is pretty funny.
[296:39.28]Pot.
[296:50.15]cut cables.
[296:51.72]They lead to the pig shed through a hole in the wall, but they've been cut.
[296:57.94]Wait.
[297:00.62]Hold on.
[297:05.26]What the hell is in here?
[297:08.04]Why do I have my Molotov cocktails out?
[297:23.48]Lever.
[297:25.36]I need to turn the power on to use the lever.
[297:29.68]Oh, so that's that.
[297:31.03]Connects to that.
[297:34.37]Search the chair.
[297:40.64]Get the fuck out of here, freak!
[297:53.47]Okay.
[297:58.33]Now I'm going to... Let's zap everything.
[298:02.43]Let's electrify everybody.
[298:04.41]Here we go.
[298:04.79]I'm going to turn the power on.
[298:26.47]What spot am I stuck?
[298:27.71]Am I stuck in his head?
[298:55.90]Nothing else in here.
[298:56.86]Alright, let's turn it on.
[298:57.64]Bingo.
[299:11.85]Dermot looks like a president.
[299:13.25]Thanks.
[299:15.23]Dude, chill!
[299:16.21]It's just a game!
[299:20.85]It's hard to chill when there's scary shit everywhere.
[299:29.39]Some of them run from the door to the outside.
[299:30.69]There's a lever and a red button on the panel.
[299:35.49]The motion range of the lever is limited by a provisionally attached plate.
[299:42.03]A node is glued to the casing.
[299:44.54]Set the voltage using the lever.
[299:45.94]The lock is set to a voltage that paralyzes the sow for a moment, around 15 seconds.
[299:54.62]The lever operates...
[299:56.91]The lever operator positions it in the middle.
[299:59.47]The feeder gives a sound signal.
[300:02.03]The operator then pushes the button and the feeder feeds the sow.
[300:04.58]Repeat until the feeding is complete.
[300:07.32]Remember, the sows are common good.
[300:08.90]Do not remove the lock.
[300:20.29]So it paralyzes for 15 seconds.
[300:30.50]Position the lever to the middle.
[300:34.04]The lever is positioned in the middle.
[300:38.52]And then I push the button and it paralyzes for 15 seconds.
[300:50.20]Should I kill it?
[300:51.60]And then I feed this out.
[300:57.34]How do I... Then I have to run over there.
[302:09.81]I mean, come on.
[302:10.41]This was like the...
[302:14.35]That pig was just being, just like, tortured and shit.
[302:17.05]Like, what do you want me to do?
[302:28.44]I just caused a famine.
[302:31.26]Well, grow soybeans!
[302:36.93]Plant some corn on the ground!
[302:48.10]Get some fresh lettuce!
[302:49.92]Just grow some lettuce, you'll be fine.
[302:51.53]You even have a lettuce wrap?

[304:04.94]Battery's dead.
[304:07.36]Fuuuuck.
[304:15.26]Okay.
[304:19.61]So, now I'm gonna do 1699.
[304:24.13]On the thing that was locked over here, whatever it was.
[304:27.89]Right?
[304:33.54]I can reload on the flashlight?
[304:36.92]Oh!
[304:40.52]Where was that thing?
[304:43.22]Where was the $16.99 thing?
[304:44.18]I think it was down here.
[304:47.66]It's like a box or something over here.
[304:52.45]Where was it?
[304:59.57]Oh!
[304:59.91]It's... I gotta go.
[305:00.61]It's late.
[305:23.99]I'm going back.
[305:29.21]I'm going.
[305:34.67]Activate the super run.
[305:56.72]Get out of the way.
[305:59.15]Oh, you piece of shit.
[306:00.49]Why?
[306:03.31]Quick, activate Super Frog.
[306:17.12]I still have to go to the wolf, too.
[306:23.93]Bye.
[306:33.15]Will you step in this so I can get free antlers?
[306:59.14]I'm going home, I'm almost there.
[307:02.71]I know it's past my bedtime.
[307:03.84]I'm going.
[307:04.66]I'm gonna make it.
[307:05.20]Alright.
[307:17.38]Another day.
[307:17.80]Let's make this quick.
[307:40.62]I was supposed to get... I was supposed to get scrap metal.
[307:47.50]And I didn't do it.
[307:52.88]Why did I not do that?
[307:54.94]What's wrong with me?
[308:01.10]This gun needs to... I'm going to have to put some stuff in a container.
[308:05.49]Molotovs, pills, the... Uh...
[308:13.10]Where's the other pitchfork?
[308:13.88]It's gone.
[308:16.19]It's gone.
[308:20.57]I can't put the flares away either.
[308:22.15]I have to start throwing shit in random boxes.
[308:31.35]No, don't sit at the table.
[308:32.87]I want the wardrobe.
[308:40.94]No, keep those.
[308:41.52]No.
[308:47.80]Alright, alright.
[308:48.56]Okay, okay, okay.
[308:49.28]I have pills, right?
[308:52.00]Yes, I do.
[308:53.12]Pills.
[308:53.86]Um, okay.
[308:55.52]Good.
[308:55.96]Go.
[309:00.62]I heard the streamer was funny.
[309:01.66]I'm disappointed.
[309:02.48]-2.
[309:09.51]How did you know about -2?
[309:14.59]If you just heard about me, and you came here for the first time, how would you know that?
[309:22.06]Liar.
[309:24.32]Spot the liar!
[309:27.63]Alright.
[309:29.71]Uh, these are still boarded.
[309:30.69]I... Can't barricade this, so people... I just have to...
[309:49.77]Where are the nails?
[309:50.29]Where are the nails?
[309:50.81]Where are the nails?
[309:51.63]Nails?
[310:06.26]Cut it.
[310:08.84]Good.
[310:10.39]This is almost done.
[310:11.17]I don't have any more traps left.
[310:13.27]I should be okay.
[310:16.37]We're going with the... I have the gun still.
[310:24.13]I'm not going to need the flashlight.
[310:25.25]I'm going to put the pills here.
[310:27.59]Or no.
[310:29.89]Yeah, that's fine.
[310:32.13]Alright, let's go, motherfuckers.
[310:36.76]What would I rate this game out of 10?
[310:39.54]No, a 3?
[310:48.98]Oh shit, heal.
[310:51.76]I used the moth already.
[310:57.52]I have to just deal with it.
[311:11.23]Zip your fly up.
[311:12.15]Oh, shit.
[311:12.61]Thanks.
[311:14.04]Appreciate that.
[311:18.02]Thank you.
[311:27.13]What door are they even in?
[311:29.33]I think they're on the other side.
[311:30.23]Bathing suits don't have flies.
[311:44.68]That's actually pretty uncomfortable.
[311:50.59]I'm not gonna move.
[311:54.88]Hey, why can't I see myself on your forehead?
[311:56.62]Don't yawn.
[312:01.00]You can?
[312:04.16]Well, uh... That's because... I... I've been playing a scary game and I've been sitting in front of the computer for five hours.
[312:12.61]And I've just peed.
[312:14.43]So I'm sorry I haven't had time to be in the washroom and like... Pat pat pat pat pat pat and like powder my face and put like a cleanser on it and everything.
[312:22.86]I'm playing Darkwood.
[312:40.72]What the fuck?
[312:41.42]He can attack!
[312:42.08]What's he doing?
[312:47.54]He just got... He just got killed by a... NO!
[313:13.46]He jumped in!
[313:31.15]Give me the gun!
[313:36.03]I can't see!
[313:36.67]I can't see!
[313:45.69]Move!
[313:46.77]Why can't I move?
[313:59.81]I'm good.
[314:13.34]Oh, that sucked.
[314:30.83]Dogs... Those big dogs die in one bullet.
[314:35.79]That's really good to know.
[314:38.63]Reload the gun?
[314:39.28]No, I don't want to waste a clip.
[314:45.54]I think this is one of those games where when you reload, it just...
[314:54.46]Come on in.
[314:55.50]Let's go.
[315:01.38]Get in here.
[315:06.48]Get out!
[315:40.27]When I missed him with the first swing and then he like went around and I swung this way somehow because he wrapped around me.
[315:50.86]Kim probably thinks there's a home intruder here.
[315:56.78]Get out of my room!
[316:01.27]Ow!
[316:02.07]Like I'm being injured?
[316:11.31]Okay, I can do the meat.
[316:15.45]Please!
[316:15.85]$7.94.
[316:15.87]I need to... I need steel.
[316:23.36]Okay.
[316:42.66]Let's go.
[316:44.44]Give me the eggs.
[316:51.86]Let's go.
[316:53.80]Go open 16 GG.
[317:03.60]Give me more magazines?
[317:04.45]You do.
[317:05.25]Give me one.
[317:15.34]Alright, let's go.
[317:15.86]I'm out.
[317:16.40]Wait.
[317:29.00]I'm out.
[317:30.14]Let's do it.
[317:30.68]Wait!
[317:31.18]Yes, I'm fine.
[317:33.27]I'm gonna have to seldomly use this weapon.
[317:37.19]Nice gamer slouch.
[317:41.83]Thanks, man.
[317:44.57]Scrap!
[318:05.94]It'll have to do.
[318:06.66]I have a gun.
[318:10.00]My whole body is itchy.
[318:25.17]Didn't this guy want meat?
[318:30.11]I didn't get it, though, did I?
[318:31.31]I... I killed the pig.
[318:43.18]Where the hell are you?
[318:50.36]Stops playing loads his head.
[318:52.17]Show item.
[318:54.08]No, gossip.
[318:55.96]I saw the villagers dragging a cart with a dead sow, the one they called the mother of all pigs.
[319:00.92]It wasn't as beautiful as they said, nowhere near the pretty lady.
[319:04.24]And that piggy, it was a bit similar to me.
[319:07.75]The boy sniffles and rubs the mask with his deformed hand.
[319:11.39]The villagers have been crying after her a lot.
[319:14.37]I saw them trying to cut through the wall of trees.
[319:16.43]Do you think it's even possible, sir?
[319:18.43]Mommy told me once that the woods are never ending and there's nothing on the other side.
[319:28.60]Whatever Can't jump this What's that, what's the grand plan?
[319:43.25]I don't know, I just, that pig did not look well It was really awful actually
[319:52.33]I'm gonna put the eggs up here in place of the shovel for now.
[319:58.01]Because I'm just running.
[320:14.65]Eat.
[320:15.79]Eat.
[320:20.53]Alright, keep going.
[320:22.69]Almost there, Wolfman.
[320:24.77]And the pig place.
[320:28.90]I need to find that.
[320:29.72]I need to find out what's going on in the cellar.
[320:42.17]It looks like a panther.
[320:43.61]What the hell was that?
[320:51.05]Okay.
[320:54.81]That was a nice reference to a show.
[320:56.21]I mean, a little bit, maybe.
[320:59.05]Alright, let's get in here.
[321:00.27]Where is this?
[321:01.07]I can't remember.
[321:07.77]It was, like, over here?
[321:11.51]Well, they took the pig out, right?
[321:15.39]So where is... It's in here.
[321:22.61]Sixteen... No, what?
[321:24.89]Where is it?
[321:27.89]Where the hell is this thing?
[321:37.10]Oh, it's in the town.
[321:39.86]Oh.
[321:41.90]Right.
[321:52.21]There's a workbench in here.
[321:54.95]Wait a minute.
[321:57.01]Is there an oven in here?
[322:03.60]It's that door right there.
[322:04.86]That's the one.
[322:05.38]No.
[322:05.88]Where's the oven?
[322:06.34]Is there an oven?
[322:15.69]This looks like a hideout.
[322:22.90]There's a workbench in here, but there's no oven.
[322:24.84]I don't know.
[322:35.20]I guess I could turn the generator on, but there's no gas.
[322:38.11]I guess there is... I don't know.
[322:45.51]Let's go to where the pig was.
[323:00.66]Go to the wolfman.
[323:03.14]Well, they took the giant pig out of here.
[323:05.20]I kind of want to see what's in the spot that it was in.
[323:07.88]What the fuck?
[323:10.30]Oh, egg.
[323:10.74]Get the fuck out of here.
[323:26.73]I'm going to shoot him.
[323:29.69]I'm going to shoot him.
[323:44.45]I... Why did I take the melee weapon off the bar?
[324:04.90]Well, it's because... I was just gonna run and just eat the eggs as I ran.
[324:20.47]The guy in the cover art is dead.
[324:22.43]That's what's in the cover art?
[324:25.39]Interesting.
[324:25.75]Alright, what is in here?
[324:26.81]There's got to be some kind of... Oh, the pigs are dead.
[324:37.02]No, they're not.
[324:38.54]They're all alive, actually.
[324:43.39]So, they took the pig out.
[324:46.81]What's here instead?
[324:52.01]Oh, come on.
[324:52.79]There's no item here.
[324:56.31]Really?
[324:56.63]That sucks.
[324:59.30]I really thought there's gonna be something in here.
[325:11.04]Check the generator room.
[325:12.16]Yeah, I will.
[325:28.12]I'm gonna go all the way out for that.
[325:29.39]I don't want to go all the way out and all the way around to go to the generator room.
[325:58.21]I don't need to eat that yet.
[325:59.17]Okay.
[326:01.77]Through here, right?
[326:08.82]Alright.
[326:10.56]Is there anything else in here?
[326:11.62]There's the lever.
[326:19.75]Dead villager.
[326:20.47]No, you didn't have anything on you.
[326:23.05]Barricaded window.
[326:23.97]Lamp.
[326:27.42]Talk to the mirror.
[326:28.53]Alright, you're kind of losing it.
[326:34.78]You are one ugly bastard.
[326:37.32]I guess you got what you deserved.
[326:57.97]Yeah, whatever.
[327:00.58]Stick it up your ass, Humpty Dumpty.
[327:04.79]Right here.
[327:05.71]Right here.
[327:07.19]What's he talking about?
[327:40.08]Alright, what am I doing?
[327:41.62]Up.
[327:42.06]Wolf.
[327:47.99]Please don't tell me I have to go all the way around.
[327:50.67]Please don't tell me I have to go all the way around.
[327:52.77]I need to go to my wolf friend.
[328:02.72]Peasant here looking good today?
[328:03.70]Thanks.
[328:09.97]We are... almost there.
[328:14.43]Top right.
[328:17.01]So, key is gonna go to the wolf.
[328:19.57]And hopefully, I get a reward.
[328:21.87]This is... You guys cool?
[328:28.80]You guys know each other?
[328:29.58]16, GG.
[328:50.21]You guys fucking know each other or what?!
[328:53.37]I didn't do anything!
[328:54.23]16, GG.
[329:24.86]Yes, show item.
[329:27.16]Here is the key covered in chicken feces.
[329:34.49]As I produce the key, the wolf's pupils widen with excitement.
[329:39.43]Well, mate, I didn't think you could succeed.
[329:43.25]I'm impressed.
[329:44.01]Time for your reward.
[329:45.23]You'll find that quick thief here.
[329:49.13]You'll find that quack thief here.
[329:51.37]But he locked himself away from the world and he won't let anybody in.
[329:54.49]So I don't know if this information will be of any use to you, meaty.
[329:58.52]What the fuck are you looking at?
[329:59.72]I promised that I'd tell you where to find him.
[330:01.62]And I did.
[330:03.16]Did I tell you you'll be able to get there?
[330:04.94]That's something else, isn't it?
[330:08.14]He laughs.
[330:10.60]Now get out of my sight, meet I have important business to attend to if you're interested in continuing our wonderful relationship.
[330:15.18]Look for me in the northeastern edge of the old woods.
[330:17.54]I predict a tasty future together.
[330:20.10]Sinks his hands into the deep pockets of his coat.
[330:23.19]Here, deliver this to that insane old bitch as a way of thank you for her beautiful sister.
[330:37.59]The wolf throws his head the head of a chicken under my feet as I lift my gaze I realize the wolf is gone What are these codes
[331:04.13]What are the codes?
[331:04.83]You have these two codes.
[331:05.85]These crates here with codes on them.
[331:16.64]Those are backer rewards.
[331:25.20]Oh.
[331:25.54]That's... Okay.
[331:41.40]Well, I gotta go this way.
[331:45.08]Um, go back and give this to the old biiitch, apparently, is what he said.
[331:49.73]I'm gonna go back and talk to the old lady.
[331:53.43]15 o'clock, yep.
[331:59.84]I gotta go.
[332:02.70]I want those crates.
[332:05.90]Can I retroactively contribute to the Kickstarter?
[332:15.33]What the fuck is happening?
[332:16.23]I'm gonna die out here!
[332:26.63]Scrap.
[332:40.16]Get me the fuck out of these woods.
[332:43.87]Why does it have to go all the way up and around?
[332:45.76]This is unnatural walling that you're doing.
[332:50.84]Why can't there be a place to go here?
[332:52.58]This is unnatural walling and it's preventing me from playing the game.
[332:56.94]I have to take this thing.
[333:04.91]Like, I have to run now.
[333:06.15]I have to.
[333:06.55]Where the hell am I?
[333:12.32]I gotta go down and then right.

[334:06.50]Oh, that's why.
[334:07.08]You fuckers.

[334:43.55]Let me accidentally hit tab real quick.
[334:50.13]Tab.
[334:58.54]Takes like four and a half seconds.
[335:19.59]What the hell even is... It's right there.
[335:25.37]I got time.
[335:26.15]Just go get it.
[335:27.59]I will shoot a motherfucker if they come near me.

[336:13.55]Okay, it's right here.
[336:15.03]Get off.
[336:15.57]That's gotta take a little bit of getting used to.
[336:17.11]Give me my stuff.
[336:30.29]I need audio.
[336:33.39]Why is this taking so long to go in?
[336:43.39]Where's my stuff?
[336:43.87]Where's my stuff?
[336:44.71]Where's my stuff?
[336:45.17]Where's my stuff?
[336:47.07]Where's my stuff?
[336:52.51]Where's my bag of stuff?

[337:04.55]Not good.
[337:05.99]Actually shit.
[337:07.23]I must return.
[337:07.79]I know.
[337:08.51]Shit.
[337:12.01]I just hit M.
[337:36.85]I'm furious.

[338:05.68]Let me in the door!
[338:06.52]What?
[338:09.10]Oh, right.
[338:20.15]That takes you forever to do anything.
[338:25.13]I could be over that in a second.
[338:26.87]Way quicker than that.
[338:33.04]Okay, wood.
[338:34.08]I need wood and nails.
[338:39.27]Where the fuck are they?
[338:42.59]Where are the nails?
[338:44.31]I had like a thousand of them.
[338:48.69]I don't have any more.
[338:57.82]I'm gonna actually get mad and fucking smash this keyboard into the wall.
[339:02.34]I'm gonna just frisbee it Do it!
[339:22.29]This guy's made out of quicksand!
[339:28.52]God, I've been doing drugs all day and I can't speed it up?
[339:42.69]I'm using the gun.
[339:55.50]It's a failed experiment.
[340:09.56]I'm gonna use the gun.
[340:19.99]Check the gas.
[340:20.75]Uh-oh.
[340:21.09]Uh-oh.
[340:25.54]Is that gonna last?
[340:49.86]Well, it was fun.
[340:50.76]Turn off the flashlight.
[340:54.99]What are you talking about?
[340:56.23]The flashlight was off!
[341:11.56]He's so mad.
[341:21.26]I wish I could make boots to not step on the poison.
[341:23.63]It's hard to see.
[341:24.39]It's like embedded into the ground.
[341:25.97]I'm gonna step in a bear trap.
[341:35.44]Who's putting the bear traps out there?
[341:44.58]Turn the lights off in your room for maximum immersion.
[341:48.46]Don't look at it, right?
[341:49.16]I don't know where it is.
[341:50.60]This isn't the gas, is it?
[342:06.36]Thank God nobody's showed up yet.
[342:13.34]Lights off.
[342:15.10]No, I'm not turning my lights off.
[342:19.93]Not right now.
[342:34.60]Why did I shoot the gun?
[342:43.39]It was moving around.
[342:44.33]It looked like it was going to explode.
[342:45.59]So I don't know.
[342:46.27]I had to shoot it.
[343:00.50]Almost there.
[343:01.96]I can make the light armor.
[343:03.03]No, I need scrap metal.
[343:04.53]Dude, I don't even know where to get scrap metal.
[343:08.33]I have to buy it from the vendors.
[343:18.32]I got plenty of gas.
[343:23.58]Oh, thank god.
[343:25.17]Thank goodness.
[343:35.34]All it was was a bug.
[343:36.84]One beetle attacked my house today.
[343:46.69]I'm okay with that.
[343:48.92]Did I loot the insect?
[343:51.58]Yeah, I did.
[343:52.36]I got the shell.
[344:05.83]150 rep.
[344:06.15]Let's get the hell out of here.
[344:09.81]I'm going to dismantle the window.
[344:12.53]So, I want scrap from you.
[344:17.46]All of it.
[344:34.90]And I will do that.
[344:37.29]And now I need to repair this shovel.
[344:39.25]I need... I don't know what I need.
[344:50.36]Shovel's now worth using again.
[344:51.74]And also... I also need... To...
[345:05.46]I need two rags.
[345:06.38]I don't have one rag.
[345:14.74]Cool.
[345:24.39]How do I put it on?
[345:28.33]Oh.
[345:28.87]You're wearing armor.
[345:32.33]It's that simple.
[345:42.39]Alright.
[345:49.13]I'm good to go.
[345:49.67]Get rid of the shiny stone.
[345:52.20]Keep the pills.
[345:53.74]Get rid of these containers.
[345:55.08]Keep the lockpicks.
[346:00.12]I need scrap.
[346:01.82]Alright.
[346:03.16]You got anything else for me?
[346:03.99]235.
[346:04.25]Not really.
[346:06.29]Okay.
[346:12.83]I'm going to refill the generator because I'm going to forget.
[346:17.03]That's a guarantee.
[346:24.81]What are we going to do?
[346:26.47]We are going to probably go back to the village and talk to the old lady.
[346:38.74]And give her the chicken head.
[346:42.01]And see what happens there.
[346:42.83]Let's complete that questline.
[346:47.03]How do you beat this game?
[346:47.97]You have to leave with a key.
[346:50.27]A special key.
[346:52.89]That I don't have.
[346:53.77]You get a key and you can leave.
[346:55.35]I guess.
[346:55.91]I think that's what happens.
[347:01.75]Alright.
[347:02.75]So that's that.
[347:04.61]I think I'm good to go.
[347:05.45]I have my pills.
[347:08.27]Got a gun.
[347:08.77]My flashlight.
[347:09.91]I'm going to replace the flashlight...
[347:13.09]I need another slot.
[347:17.61]It's alright.
[347:18.05]Okay.
[347:19.31]Let's go to the village.
[347:23.15]I'm good to go.
[347:28.27]I wonder- I have no idea how this is gonna happen.
[347:31.25]Uh, the village is on fire.
[347:36.79]What is that?
[347:40.77]Oh, that's the pig.
[347:45.09]Oh, this place is kind of in shambles, huh?
[347:53.35]Oops.
[347:58.45]Okay.
[348:00.78]It's your fault.
[348:04.30]Is it, though?
[348:04.74]Alright, old lady.
[348:43.21]That's probably something to do there.
[348:44.79]I'm gonna end up killing that thing.
[348:49.14]Or that person, whatever it is.
[348:50.38]I don't know.
[349:00.48]You're a boomer.
[349:02.46]Just hit it with a stick.
[349:04.88]No, I'm not gonna hit that person with a stick.
[349:11.08]Alright, where's the old lady's house?
[349:13.41]Whoa.
[349:13.95]Who's this?
[349:14.77]Is that the doctor?
[349:19.00]No?
[349:19.20]Oh, everyone's getting sick.
[349:25.04]Easy.
[349:26.14]What the hell is... We're never going to make it.
[349:32.23]These woods have no end.
[349:35.77]We'll just starve here.
[349:36.89]Alright.
[349:47.12]My hands are killing me.
[349:55.63]Stasek, it's your turn now.
[350:02.99]God damn it.
[350:07.16]He's deaf all of a sudden.
[350:13.80]Wait, this guy has an axe.
[350:14.76]He has an axe.
[350:17.81]He has an axe.
[350:19.69]You're right.
[350:21.31]He'll drop this, right?
[350:27.32]There ain't nobody over here.
[350:33.56]Wait, actually, he has a better weapon than me, though.
[350:38.45]He'll probably turn and one-shot me.
[350:48.72]I have a gun.
[350:53.09]Why would I use this when I have a gun?
[351:00.61]I want that axe.
[351:01.79]If he drops the axe, I'm doing it.
[351:03.17]Okay.
[351:32.51]That's 450 bucks.
[351:35.93]That I don't have to spend.
[351:42.01]Look, they've been eating people in this village.
[351:45.99]We're all so innocent!
[352:00.43]Where's the witch's house?
[352:03.87]The chicken lady.
[352:05.69]Is it blocked off now, or am I going the wrong way?
[352:13.74]Oh, no.
[352:14.20]I shot a guy who's eaten probably five people to take his axe.
[352:18.34]Alright, I'm almost there.
[352:52.82]Wasn't there something down here?
[352:55.20]I think there was.
[352:59.02]Didn't this guy have, like, a box down here that I couldn't open?
[353:04.73]No.
[353:06.03]Where am I thinking that was?
[353:06.95]Am I insane, or did he have one?
[353:19.92]I thought he did.
[353:22.50]Where is it?
[353:30.18]I've already searched all these.
[353:31.28]There's not one in here.
[353:32.76]I don't know.
[353:42.57]I need a key.
[353:44.31]I'm inside the house.
[353:47.45]The door is locked from the outside and it's locked from the inside.
[353:57.60]Why do you gotta block me off?
[353:59.58]I just wanna go that way!
[354:01.14]I just wanna go that way!
[354:46.58]Quit eating people
[355:00.37]Quit killing people.
[355:01.17]What are you talking about?
[355:01.85]How many people have I eaten?
[355:06.41]Zero!
[355:07.35]I've had zero people for breakfast.
[355:20.71]Why have you forsaken us?
[355:22.45]I'm taking the jewel too.
[355:23.85]No, I'm not.
[355:28.64]What have we done to have wronged you?
[355:33.64]They're eating the pigs.
[355:36.94]I thought the guy was... I thought they were eating people.
[355:40.24]And the pig.
[355:41.44]I thought it was double food source.
[355:42.62]Like, I thought they were eating people too.
[355:43.96]One guy was eating people.
[355:48.50]One guy was eating people.
[355:59.31]They feed people.
[356:00.58]It's all fucked up.
[356:28.93]Alright, everything's fine.
[356:29.93]Don't worry.
[356:33.10]No witnesses.
[356:33.80]That's not how this works.
[356:34.76]This is even the right house.
[356:38.52]This is not even the right house.
[356:42.68]I wish I had a map of this place.
[356:47.50]This is her secret house with the key in it.
[356:59.86]I wish I had a map.
[357:01.66]It helps to have a map.
[357:02.82]I know.
[357:03.40]And I wish I had one.
[357:04.81]But time is frozen.
[357:12.81]Is it over here?
[357:16.81]What is this?
[357:17.24]This is a box on the ground.
[357:18.42]Oh, that's the doll.
[357:23.88]Barnes to the west.
[357:24.72]Chicken Lady is just south of Burnt House.
[357:26.72]Mayer is to the northeast.
[357:35.54]All the way to the left.
[357:36.58]That's where I'm going now.
[357:45.26]There's a chest.
[357:48.32]He's gonna... I'm not gonna kill the mayor.
[357:50.03]I'm not gonna kill the mayor.
[357:51.43]Alright, so this is not it, right?
[358:06.42]Where is this old motherfucker's house?
[358:13.84]It's... Up... Every house is just the same house.
[358:20.87]It's a square.
[358:30.85]Why can't I get a map for this stupid village?
[358:37.65]I can get a map for the Silent Forest, but I can't get a map of the village with people in it that live here?
[358:46.12]Nobody drew a map of this place?
[358:51.53]Oh shit.
[359:07.82]I'll take that.
[359:08.18]I'll take the Molotov cocktails.
[359:10.79]I'll take some rope.
[359:12.27]And I'll take the photo!
[359:20.97]Okay, cool.
[359:24.44]So there it is.
[359:25.88]Shotgun.
[359:27.74]Memories.
[359:35.60]Alright.
[359:37.42]So now that I have that, I want to go to the old lady's house.
[359:43.46]In this gigantic Disneyland maze.
[359:47.56]That wasn't me, that was in the game.
[359:54.26]Now I'll go right.
[359:58.41]Go left.
[360:01.07]It's that house right there.
[360:04.61]No, it's not.
[360:05.31]It's not this one.
[360:06.07]Because it's the one with the broom down here.
[360:10.85]It's le- I'm gonna scream into the mic.
[360:15.23]Why is- Who is this?
[360:16.33]Oh, that's the person that I shot.
[360:20.34]Go left?
[360:22.12]I can't go left!
[360:23.12]This is an unnatural wall!
[360:42.83]There is no left.
[360:49.57]I thought she was to the right.
[360:52.03]Wasn't she to the right?
[361:03.63]This is the house with the person that's lying on the ground here.
[361:05.73]She's to the right.
[361:09.61]She's actually to the right.
[361:11.65]There's nothing over here left.
[361:12.83]The person lying down on the ground over there is left.
[361:15.67]There's the well.
[361:18.57]Might as well kill that person too.
[361:20.15]No!
[361:21.89]Okay.
[361:25.46]This is the hole to go back to the house.
[361:28.50]They're burning the pig over here.
[361:32.06]Up here is... The guy that's eating people.
[361:50.24]That shit fucked me up.
[361:51.56]That's the problem.
[361:52.84]That was the problem right there, guys.
[361:54.88]That's the issue.
[361:55.36]I would have found this like 13 minutes ago.
[361:58.16]Do you understand?
[362:01.12]The burning pig was surrounded by burnt trees.
[362:05.27]It kept me out.
[362:06.43]I could... Look, you don't even need to tell me.
[362:19.82]hey look at this just give me a fucking map lost in the disneyland parking lot yes I got a map for everything else in the whole game except for the one place that requires one to see points of interest on it did you see the chicken head yet
[362:47.18]Mister, have mercy upon me and find her.
[362:49.28]Mother Mary, I don't know what I'm gonna do without her all by myself.
[362:54.03]You parked in the Donald Duck section.
[362:59.29]Yeah, that shit sucks.
[363:00.65]Because it's like Donald Duck A2.
[363:03.75]Donald Duck A1.
[363:04.91]Donald Duck A, and it goes from A all the way to like F. So, oh, where are you parked?
[363:10.90]I don't know.
[363:11.58]I think I'm in Goofy F6.
[363:13.54]Goofy F6.
[363:18.57]I'm a Donald Duck B-622!
[363:20.55]What do you want me to do?
[363:28.63]Your mother's... Your mother... Oh, the pig, right.
[363:30.93]Okay.
[363:33.55]Let's gossip for a second.
[363:35.11]Poor Hoduska has lost her mind.
[363:36.37]Her fella knocked her up with this abomination.
[363:38.71]Even them mongrels... We already saw this.
[363:42.52]Show item.
[363:49.52]Jesus almighty, my little darling, what have they done to you?
[363:52.52]This is a bad sign, mister, a bad sign.
[363:54.36]What will happen now?
[364:07.18]Um...
[364:21.71]Military flashlight.
[364:24.55]A rag and pills.
[364:26.95]Clothes.
[364:27.61]A sheet and a few pairs of worn trousers.
[364:36.08]Well, you ain't here anymore.
[364:37.08]Sheets.
[364:37.98]A pile of crumbled pillows and pillowcases.
[364:39.68]Looks like someone has slept here.
[364:40.94]A wedding ring.
[364:45.44]Thank you.
[364:53.06]Okay.
[364:55.58]Nice.
[365:09.55]Okay.
[365:10.45]I wish I could find a fat little bug.
[365:12.22]Okay, what do you want?
[365:13.66]Alright, well I think I did that.
[365:18.56]I've got the shotgun.
[365:22.75]Pig is gone.
[365:24.35]And now I have the new area up top to go up to.
[365:27.85]Kill her.
[365:31.75]Why would you write that?
[365:33.03]Why would you write that?
[365:33.79]Why would you write banana cream pie?
[365:36.11]Completely without any reason to write it.
[365:40.27]You just wrote it and I read it.
[365:42.39]Why would you write that?
[365:43.29]Why would you do this to me?
[365:51.86]You're a coward.
[365:52.64]No, I'm probably going to need to talk to that person later.
[365:59.16]You know I'm on a diet right now.
[366:00.60]See, this shit fucked me all up.
[366:01.92]Because I couldn't go around it.
[366:02.90]Okay, I come over here.
[366:04.34]I come over here, right?
[366:05.10]Typically I knew the witch was over on the right.
[366:07.04]Alright, here we are.
[366:07.80]I just got out.
[366:08.54]Oh, this is about... Oh, they have this fucking giant pig here.
[366:12.50]Oh, shit.
[366:13.87]This is just here now.
[366:14.83]I can't go around this.
[366:16.19]There's like a bunch of stuff here.
[366:17.99]Where's that witch?
[366:18.71]And then I went down this way.
[366:19.85]I thought I had to go that way.
[366:21.36]That's my explanation.
[366:22.20]If you don't like that, then whatever.
[366:25.96]Can't help you.
[366:30.53]Blame the unnatural walling that goes down in a straight line past the pig.
[366:34.57]Why can't I just walk right over here?
[366:35.87]Alright, I'm done.
[366:43.04]Where am I going?
[366:49.11]Homemade shotgun.
[366:49.95]I don't have any... How many shells do I have?
[366:52.61]The mayor.
[366:59.90]The mayor.
[367:00.48]Right.
[367:03.72]Where's the mayor's house?
[367:12.62]It says useless after... So I can shoot that one time.
[367:18.17]Buffalo chicken pizza.
[367:19.09]You guys are cruel.
[367:19.95]You guys are cruel.
[367:23.78]Garlic bread.
[367:24.60]I can't eat that either.
[367:25.38]I can eat lettuce.
[367:28.32]Crab meat.
[367:30.46]Turkey patties.
[367:31.38]Plain without seasoning.
[367:34.31]Some vegetables.
[367:40.59]Damn it.
[367:40.95]Alright.
[367:42.07]Where's this guy's house?
[367:45.27]Mayor's house.
[367:48.09]Not over here.
[367:48.73]Alright, from where I'm standing right now, where should I go to the mayor's house?
[367:56.76]Up?
[368:09.21]Perfectly cooked and seasoned sirloin steak.
[368:12.01]See, unfortunately for you, I don't really like steak.
[368:18.02]So, that doesn't really do it for me.
[368:21.16]It's by that bridge.
[368:26.52]Not this way.
[368:35.49]Mayor.
[368:42.07]No, I don't really like steak.
[368:44.35]I just don't.
[368:46.03]I like... Red meat is great.
[368:50.43]I think I like hamburgers.
[368:51.87]I like corned beef.
[368:53.87]I'm a huge pastrami fan.
[368:56.72]Pastrami is seriously one of my favorite... Like, kind of... Go to the deli.
[369:04.56]But... Get away from me.
[369:07.20]What are you talking about?
[369:08.16]What's wrong with you?
[369:08.70]What are you doing over here?
[369:09.86]Are you the mayor?
[369:10.48]Are you the mayor?
[369:12.50]Where's the mayor?
[369:23.18]Just checking it out.
[369:27.92]Sliced a shaved, uh, shaved pastrami, like a shaved pastrami sandwich.
[369:38.77]I need to stop talking about this.
[369:43.27]Where did I just go?
[369:49.44]Yeah, with a slice of Swiss cheese on it.
[369:55.20]Maybe a little bit of mustard.
[369:58.02]For sure.
[369:58.68]It's good stuff.
[370:01.99]Okay, so here is a house.
[370:05.11]This is not the mayor's house.
[370:07.33]It's just a house over here.
[370:10.53]South of bridge, then immediate left.
[370:21.14]The Mayor House is a house with a generator.
[370:47.30]This is the only structure that's over here.
[370:53.76]This is the only structure that's over here.
[370:56.92]Is it this one right here?
[371:17.69]Where's the mayor?
[371:27.15]The mayor wants to see you.
[371:30.05]I don't know what house he lives in.
[371:33.40]By the way, he's in the cellar.
[371:52.17]Oh, I shot the guy immediately.
[371:53.59]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[371:54.57]That's right.
[371:55.73]He would have told me.
[371:57.41]I shot him the second he said go to the mayor's house.
[372:00.30]And I'm sitting here complaining.
[372:03.12]I don't know where the mayor's house is, but the guy that was going to give me the information, I killed him immediately.
[372:11.34]I need to apologize for this.
[372:13.10]Because he would have told me what to do.
[372:16.18]Probably, right?
[372:16.94]I have to say sorry about that one.
[372:22.41]Hey, mayor.
[372:26.39]Let's make some legislature.
[372:29.10]Give me +2, +2.
[372:30.12]Please, please, God, please, please, God, please, God.
[372:38.95]Alright, where is he?
[372:53.63]Come here for a second.
[372:54.45]Come on.
[372:59.43]It's him!
[372:59.87]He's the one who killed Arsal!
[373:03.56]UNLEASH!
[373:04.74]ANTEC!
[373:07.18]WHOA!
[373:25.98]Which one of you is the mayor?
[373:28.97]I... you wanted to see me.
[373:38.50]That was pretty shitty.
[373:40.16]Antec was pretty bad.
[373:41.96]I was thinking it was gonna be bigger.
[373:42.98]It was just a guy with a headcribe on his head.
[373:49.75]Was this the mayor?
[373:58.25]Oh, shit.
[374:00.41]Oh, we're finally gonna find out what's in the fucking cellar, mate.
[374:10.27]Welder.
[374:13.82]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[374:15.70]All this stuff is important.
[374:17.58]Except for probably the... The rope.
[374:20.62]And the nails.
[374:27.61]The wood.
[374:30.30]That meat is useless.
[374:31.56]Who cares?
[374:31.98]Alright, nothing else on these guys.
[374:43.16]I'll just pitchfork.
[374:43.98]I don't want odd meat in the wire.
[374:49.99]Damn it.
[374:52.27]I can make some toothpicks that open doors.
[375:01.16]Give me some room.
[375:02.56]Yes, good.
[375:10.00]Oh mayor, where are you?
[375:33.21]I think I killed the mayor.
[375:35.78]It was a trap to kill you, so you guys are mad that I killed that person.
[375:41.06]Yeah?
[375:42.80]I preliminarily eliminated another enemy.
[375:47.94]Why can I not leave?
[375:58.09]It's good to go.
[376:00.80]Nice, alright.
[376:01.48]Well, I'm done with this town.
[376:09.77]You searched the villager on accident, not the chomper.
[376:15.53]What?
[376:39.07]Alright, so this village is done.
[376:42.28]Did what I can here.
[376:45.24]Leave the potato, I don't care.
[376:46.40]I got a lot of shit now.
[376:49.92]I got a military flashlight.
[376:53.62]Go back.
[376:56.07]And then... What time is it?
[376:57.81]Are you sure it's the chopper or an accident?
[377:01.61]Alright, now I know where to go.
[377:10.03]You have the whole city.
[377:11.27]The city is yours.
[377:16.35]There's the well, and now... Go this way.
[377:21.01]See?
[377:21.33]I got here immediately.
[377:25.46]So!
[377:28.20]What do you think we're doing tomorrow?
[377:47.70]No, this!
[377:48.22]I have... Why is there blood everywhere?
[377:54.54]Why is it... this pig... there's a pig... bunch of pig heads in here.
[377:57.55]Why?
[377:59.35]They know where I live?
[378:00.07]It's kind of creepy.
[378:07.71]Uh, so, there... I have... like six or seven horror games that I'm gonna play.
[378:14.48]Over the next few weeks.
[378:16.49]I kind of want to see this through.
[378:22.35]Do you think, whoever has played this game, that I could beat this game in another six to seven hours?
[378:35.96]Maybe.
[378:36.40]No.
[378:37.24]Absolutely.
[378:37.80]Definitely.
[378:38.52]No.
[378:40.42]Almost.
[378:42.94]Absolutely not.
[378:46.01]Okay, well... Maybe.
[378:49.49]I didn't get anything down there.
[378:59.00]Rope.
[379:01.24]I have this axe head.
[379:07.30]These have to go.
[379:08.99]I'm not gonna ever use them.
[379:10.79]The three matchsticks are gonna go.
[379:12.59]The three pieces of bread...
[379:17.14]I don't understand what I do with the meat, though.
[379:22.18]The bone is going to stay.
[379:31.96]I have these two toolboxes that I'm thinking of getting rid of.
[379:37.28]These nails.
[379:39.04]I have 50 nails.
[379:40.74]Get rid of the potato.
[379:42.96]Put the rag in here.
[379:44.22]Because I have rags.
[379:45.61]Get the flashlight in here.
[379:48.46]The shotgun in here.
[379:51.29]The alcohol.
[379:53.51]The rope.
[379:57.05]The molotovs.
[379:59.15]Get this out of here.
[380:00.46]Get this out of here.
[380:01.86]Unnecessary.
[380:05.16]I'm just going to throw it on the ground.
[380:11.03]All this shit is out of here.
[380:18.48]Takes most people anywhere between 15 to 30 hours to beat this game.
[380:23.15]Well... Hmm.
[380:27.35]Let me ask you this.
[380:29.81]So if tomorrow I played something else, and then the next day I point back to this.
[380:44.16]Break it up a little bit?
[380:45.74]You're not going to play this again if I do that.
[380:50.52]um do I need to break it up or do we just play it change the pace and then let's play it let's just let's let's get it done yeah let's just finish it tomorrow you're never gonna finish it you're not gonna finish it tomorrow
[381:21.09]There's like 12 hours left.
[381:24.82]Well.
[381:25.16]Alright, we're gonna break it up.
[381:29.96]No, we're not.
[381:30.74]I don't know.
[381:31.38]I don't know.
[381:31.70]We'll see tomorrow.
[381:34.82]I have the super spooky jump scare mansion HD to play.
[381:41.07]I wanna do that.
[381:50.20]You're weak.
[381:54.75]What if we do that tomorrow and then... I think that game is only three or four hours long.
[382:03.87]So if we do that tomorrow, start with that, and then just move on to this.
[382:10.56]Play this for like another couple hours and just then move on.
[382:13.26]Yeah.
[382:20.26]That sounds fun.
[382:21.10]Let's do that.
[382:23.92]We'll play this tomorrow after that for a while.
[382:27.19]What game am I playing tomorrow?
[382:28.53]Jumpscare Mansion.
[382:32.09]I think that's what it's called.
[382:32.85]Something like that.
[382:33.49]Like the spooky jumpscare mansion.
[382:35.68]But I'm too far into this, I think, to just give up on it now.
[382:40.04]So we're going to do this again.
[382:45.01]Close out tomorrow's stream in another couple hours of this.
[382:48.02]Maybe two or three hours of this.
[382:50.76]And then... The next day... Play this again.
[382:57.10]Because I did say I wanted to do four days in a row.
[383:02.92]I think that's a... I think I'm going to call it here.
[383:08.43]The... Is that like six hour mark?
[383:11.01]I think it's like a perfect time for a game like this for me.
[383:15.47]It's enough for me to get over the stress.
[383:19.39]So then tomorrow we'll do the Spooky Mansion and then come back to this for like a few hours.
[383:24.13]Time is passing in-game?
[383:25.15]It's alright.
[383:28.17]Okay, I was gonna throw this stuff away.
[383:32.10]Do I have... Let me... Well, let me finish... Let me get through this last night.
[383:36.32]So I can sell this crap.
[383:41.66]That sounds like a good idea.
[383:46.96]I'm going to get rid of these bottles.
[383:48.76]Yeah, I'm going to sell all this junk.
[383:51.92]The bread, shiny stone.
[383:53.54]Okay, I have the shovel.
[383:54.82]Alright, I'm going to get through this.
[383:56.38]And then I'm going to clean up the inventory so it's ready to go for tomorrow.
[384:00.68]So in the meantime... I'm going to get my lost stuff that's over here.
[384:11.93]Let's go.
[384:16.96]He's never going to finish this game.
[384:18.20]I mean, I might.
[384:20.30]I'm willing to give this at least another one or two solid... At least four to seven hours of game.
[384:29.61]I'm too far into this to not... I'm like 60, 70% of the way through this game.
[384:40.96]Okay, here we are.
[384:41.94]Lost inventory is right here somewhere.
[384:46.53]There it is.
[384:48.87]Good.
[384:57.12]Alright, we got it.
[384:57.88]We'll close out this last night.
[385:16.67]Is it Chapter 2?
[385:18.95]Yeah, I would assume.
[385:20.17]It's up here.
[385:25.54]But you don't start a game that says, welcome to Chapter 1, and there's no Chapter 2.
[385:32.36]Alright, let's deposit this shit.
[385:42.16]Just gotta make it to tomorrow.
[385:44.77]I'm gonna sell the flares.
[385:47.61]I don't care about them.
[385:48.93]Really at all.
[385:52.10]Get rid of these bottles.
[385:54.42]I'm 14 hours into this game.
[385:57.38]I've not seen one use of the bottle.
[385:59.52]Besides to break and put glass on the ground.
[386:02.02]You don't put shit in it.
[386:04.54]I'm getting rid of them.
[386:05.34]I don't want them anymore.
[386:08.94]These jars of meat don't do anything either.
[386:15.64]Make molotovs.
[386:20.29]Yeah, but you have to use gas for this.
[386:22.83]And rags.
[386:24.11]Rags make... Rags make bandages, which are, I think, more important.
[386:33.73]Yeah, I'm just going to sell them all.
[386:34.95]I'm going to recycle all these bottles.
[386:38.97]Alright, good.
[386:40.81]In the meantime, the final thing I'm going to do is I want to... I'm going to go to the right, because somehow I have not been over there.
[386:47.70]I don't know how...
[386:51.81]The lantern's really important later.
[386:55.61]Yeah.
[386:56.71]I'll make the lantern later.
[386:57.79]How have I not been over here?
[387:10.50]Is there nothing over here at all?
[387:11.78]Doesn't look like it.
[387:28.43]No.
[387:29.19]Wait.
[387:30.39]No.
[387:36.45]There is something over here.
[387:42.86]Shrine.
[387:43.80]What is this?
[387:45.02]Where is this shrine?
[387:46.60]What is this?
[387:50.56]Shrine?
[387:54.48]Not gonna get me this time.
[388:07.03]Just kind of there.
[388:07.65]Hey!
[388:37.67]They're worth nine.
[388:43.30]Where's the shiny stone?
[388:53.81]Grab it.
[389:06.82]Okay, I think I'm at the end of the woods here.
[389:08.32]Who the hell is that?
[389:13.30]Where are you?
[389:16.10]What?
[389:16.64]Alright, I don't wanna die out here, so... Not in my best interest.
[389:35.60]Alright, let's go back.
[389:39.37]Acid blood's paying off.
[389:41.15]No, it actually is really, really good.
[389:47.13]My house is starting to get taken over by this slime.
[389:49.03]Alright, what we got?
[389:54.34]Deposit.
[389:57.10]Last one more night, rearrange the inventory, and then we can get out of here.
[390:05.99]Didn't I just say I was done?
[390:08.31]Yeah, I will be.
[390:09.16]I just want to get a good fresh save point.
[390:17.74]Shiny stone, shiny stone.
[390:21.66]Rag.
[390:23.67]Clip.
[390:25.99]Battery.
[390:26.41]Let's refill that.
[390:28.91]I have a lot of lockpicks too.
[390:36.03]Yeah.
[390:37.38]That's good.
[390:38.48]I'm ready.
[390:46.00]I'm going to use my heal.
[390:48.47]I've got some time here.
[390:51.75]You know, I could go for some nice crunchy iceberg lettuce.
[390:54.15]That doesn't sound good.
[390:55.95]No, it doesn't.
[390:56.45]Actually, that's terrible.
[390:59.25]That's the real stuff coming out right there.
[391:07.51]Can't pretend on that one.
[391:11.87]Alright, I'm just gonna get... I need to board up this stuff one more time.
[391:16.63]So let's get some wood and a few nails.
[391:20.65]A couple more nails.
[391:24.17]A couple more.
[391:24.83]Yeah, 20.
[391:25.31]Let's hop the fence.
[391:34.23]That's barricaded.
[391:35.01]This is not.
[391:40.33]This has plenty of gas, yes.
[391:44.09]This is okay, but not great.
[391:53.06]You could have finished the game already if you didn't spend half the day inside your safe house.
[392:00.16]You know, you're right.
[392:02.75]That's true.
[392:04.69]But I'll die if I go out there.
[392:07.56]That's actually true.
[392:08.72]I would have 50% more game time outside.
[392:13.39]Or 100%.
[392:17.89]I want this in front of the store.
[392:25.47]Don't turn it on yet.
[392:31.13]These glass bottles.
[392:32.71]This reminds me of when I used to pick up plates in Fallout.
[392:37.19]I just have 16 pounds or 20 pounds of silverware on me.
[392:43.52]So get these out of here.
[392:47.34]Cover the floor in glass.
[392:48.68]Now that is the smartest thing I've heard all day.
[393:11.62]Now I actually can't move.
[393:20.05]Put the glass outside the window.
[393:21.27]I don't.
[393:27.73]I'll be fine.
[393:28.23]I got a gun.
[393:33.70]Heels.
[393:34.40]Right.
[393:34.60]I'm going to do this.
[393:42.23]This doesn't do damage to me.
[393:43.31]Alright, that's good.
[393:43.83]That's good to know.
[393:52.75]Hide in the corner.
[393:55.81]This has been okay so far.
[393:56.97]I had that one dog problem.
[393:59.95]Where the dogs would just jump in and out of the windows really quickly.
[394:04.69]But, I'm alright.
[394:09.63]Shovel should be fine.
[394:13.31]What about the Banshee?
[394:15.57]Yeah, but that was once.
[394:16.37]What currency is this?
[394:19.11]What do you mean?
[394:31.08]Currency?
[394:43.44]Somebody just said I look like Michael Jackson.
[394:51.07]Do people just write random words when I press enter?
[395:09.46]I don't look like Michael Jackson, okay?
[395:21.52]Well fine, whatever.
[395:44.49]Banana cream pie, banana cream pie.
[395:52.81]That's so mean.
[395:57.31]I'm gonna go just eat lettuce in the bathtub.
[396:03.90]Alright, this is where they come in. 21.
[396:28.35]I'm not in here.
[396:29.05]Just don't move, don't move, don't move.
[396:50.32]Oh god, take out the gun.
[396:53.92]Oh, he's gonna get in.
[397:19.30]Where is he?
[397:20.50]Don't move.
[397:32.32]Did he hear the gunshots and came around this way?
[397:40.20]No.
[397:40.96]No, no, no, no.
[397:41.98]Is this one of the... Is that it?
[397:45.29]Take it down!
[397:45.83]Take the window down!
[397:59.01]What the fuck is that thing?
[398:00.29]Oh God.
[398:51.49]What's that?
[398:52.45]What's that mean?
[398:55.96]I'm just gonna leave my house.
[399:04.10]What the hell?
[399:26.26]Get the sunlight out, please!
[400:03.66]Jesus.
[400:12.60]Well, that was annoying.
[400:13.42]Okay, so let me do this real quick and then we can get out of here.
[400:22.59]I have nothing to cook.
[400:24.58]I have a lot of things to sell you.
[400:26.14]I have a lot of junk that I want to get rid of.
[400:29.54]All the bottles.
[400:33.82]This is not like Fallout where he's going to run out of money, right?
[400:36.17]Okay.
[400:38.39]Shiny stone.
[400:39.01]Shiny stone.
[400:42.51]Take it all.
[400:44.25]Doesn't have enough room in his inventory.
[400:46.27]Okay, what about a fabric?
[400:49.89]Buy the mushroom.
[400:53.31]And the fabric.
[400:54.91]Because that's just a guarantee.
[400:56.49]Just I can upgrade something.
[400:58.91]Get the metal.
[400:59.51]Where's your metal?
[401:00.13]There it is.
[401:00.53]Alright.
[401:02.91]I got 700.
[401:03.23]I got so much money with this dude.
[401:08.23]Buy the rags.
[401:09.31]Buy the wire.
[401:10.03]Always.
[401:11.69]I'm also going to buy... A magazine.
[401:19.37]And a fabric.
[401:22.08]And then you're going to take these matchsticks because they're stupid.
[401:25.40]These flares because they're dumb.
[401:27.46]The bread because you're hungry.
[401:30.87]And the meat because you're also... You want something more than bread.
[401:38.65]Good.
[401:42.78]Now let's do this.
[401:46.50]I cannot craft any more of those, so I'm going to do another hotbar.
[401:49.80]It's just an extra inventory slot.
[401:54.14]Good.
[401:58.00]Now, let's clean up the inventory.
[402:01.69]Seven scrap, which is, I believe it's enough for me to upgrade the shovel.
[402:06.85]Which is less stamina.
[402:10.61]Tacks use less stamina, or should I just wait until I can get that?
[402:14.27]I think I'm going to do that.
[402:17.46]I also can repair the armor.
[402:20.98]This item cannot be repaired.
[402:24.13]The armor is not repairable.
[402:25.51]Okay.
[402:26.07]Interesting.
[402:26.45]Good to know.
[402:28.79]Let's clean up the inventory.
[402:34.40]Bandage.
[402:36.58]Lockpick.
[402:38.52]I got too many of these.
[402:41.50]Cook the mushroom.
[402:50.23]Alright.
[402:51.11]Here we go.
[402:52.89]Organization time.
[403:01.40]Can we confirm that these are useless?
[403:07.21]Somebody that's played this like 4,000 hours of this game.
[403:11.45]Do I actually need this for anything?
[403:14.17]Just get rid of them.
[403:18.75]You're good to sell them.
[403:19.81]Alright.
[403:20.22]I'm just gonna sell them.
[403:23.06]I don't know if the wedding ring is needed for anything.
[403:24.62]I have three lunchboxes.
[403:25.88]I don't know why I have this many.
[403:29.18]That helps free up some room.
[403:30.52]So does this.
[403:34.80]I'm with this.
[403:35.52]I have meat.
[403:39.08]The chicken head I feel like at some point maybe would be useful.
[403:42.06]I don't know for what though.
[403:46.43]Alcohol torch.
[403:47.47]Alright, let's get rid of these.
[403:54.24]I really hope I don't need these for upgrades or anything.
[403:56.02]Because they don't... I can't get them anywhere.
[404:00.36]You need the boxes for upgrading the workbench.
[404:03.40]You need them, you need them, you need them.
[404:07.50]Well, shit.
[404:12.80]Um... Oh, that's right, the other... The other workbenches, though.
[404:19.77]Don't I have to do the other ones?
[404:25.43]I already have them, though.
[404:26.77]Is it already there?
[404:28.62]There are more workbenches.
[404:30.32]They all have the same level.
[404:34.36]They're global.
[404:35.80]Okay.
[404:40.42]Okay.
[404:42.59]So you can't take all this, so I'm gonna do... I could.
[404:49.65]Just get some more pills.
[404:53.97]Get a red egg and cook it.
[405:00.18]Make the axe?
[405:00.70]I can't make the axe until I upgrade the bench one more time.
[405:07.43]So I cannot do that.
[405:08.31]100 essence.
[405:16.67]Okay, organization time.
[405:20.48]Gasoline which is I'm counting to pay attention to alcohol gasoline can stay down here I'll craft like a super bandage Go and that's looks good three of those so we got alcohol Miscellaneous junk weapons up here
[405:51.75]What's this mirror for?
[405:56.89]Weapon part.
[405:57.63]Get the rag out of there.
[405:58.71]Scrap metal come down here.
[406:00.57]I'm gonna just... I'm gonna classify that as a weapon.
[406:07.69]I mean, technically, kind of.
[406:10.23]Chicken head's not a weapon.
[406:12.49]Or weapon part.
[406:16.89]This bone seems kind of useless.
[406:27.40]Bottles of stuff to put down near malltops.
[406:29.70]There's gonna be a drug category here.
[406:39.28]Drugs and medicine will go down here.
[406:47.36]Materials here.
[406:51.14]Wood and other materials here.
[406:58.99]miscellaneous junk this is just the shit it's just junk man weapon parts matchsticks yeah that can stay down here
[407:24.80]I wish I could put these in more than one stack.
[407:27.66]Or more than, you know, two.
[407:29.42]Three.
[407:32.28]That's alright.
[407:33.60]Scrap metal.
[407:34.80]Wood.
[407:36.78]Weapon parts can stay up here.
[407:39.10]Axe.
[407:39.64]Shotgun for the axe.
[407:42.11]Welder.
[407:42.79]Whatever.
[407:43.05]You can spray somebody in the face with it and hurt them.
[407:46.28]Chicken head's gonna come down here.
[407:48.54]Battery's gonna go this way.
[407:50.30]Other miscellaneous parts, like wires and shit.
[407:55.08]Everything that I don't know what the hell to do with is gonna go up here.
[407:58.23]So I don't know what any of these are really supposed to be for.
[408:00.35]I know the chicken egg is technically... It's like a healing item, technically.
[408:03.61]I'm good.
[408:12.81]Ah, feels good.
[408:20.10]Lockpicks up here.
[408:21.12]The nails.
[408:26.51]Wood.
[408:26.81]I can turn this wood into new planks and put them over here.
[408:30.77]Alright.
[408:32.35]Done.
[408:34.14]We're organized.
[408:36.04]Way more than I was before.
[408:49.30]now let's do this I'm gonna buy another no not not yet let's do another tank my gasoline supply is starting to deplete more hot bar is very very useful too
[409:20.34]I like it.
[409:34.53]This is a mod for Don't Starve.
[409:36.29]Yes.
[409:42.09]That looks good.
[409:49.63]Is it really?
[409:50.85]Look it up.
[409:54.25]There we go.
[409:56.31]I hate the one stack of this shit.
[410:02.12]Wood.
[410:03.92]This part, the metal shit can go up here.
[410:05.76]Alright, I'm fine with this.
[410:13.90]Nothing needs to be repaired or upgraded.
[410:15.30]I could make traps if I wanted to, but...
[410:20.63]No, I'm not going to.
[410:23.45]Anything else I want to get from you before I stop this?
[410:26.07]I don't think so.
[410:33.16]Long barrel.
[410:35.42]We're good.
[410:43.33]Game is saved.
[410:44.97]Got it.
[410:49.28]And that is where we are going to call it a night.
[410:54.15]We'll be ready for it tomorrow.
[410:55.91]Tomorrow we're going to start with that jump scare mansion.
[411:00.11]And then from there we're going to try this again.
[411:02.88]For a couple hours.
[411:03.86]And then we'll see what we want to do the night after that.
[411:08.04]But I'm into it.
[411:09.36]I think this is fun.
[411:12.79]I'm into it.
[411:20.88]I still don't understand why this doesn't work.
[411:23.00]It just does not work.
[411:49.76]I'm gonna put it on weekly for now, because that seems to work, but that doesn't make any sense either.
[411:59.03]Session top cheer.
[412:01.65]How about weekly top cheer?
[412:08.73]Doesn't make any sense.
[412:10.17]Streamlabs OBS.
[412:12.19]Not impressed.
[412:17.64]This is apparently weekly.
[412:29.52]I'm not impressed.
[412:34.14]Uh... Nah, this is all wrong.
[412:44.47]This is the most recent cheer.
[412:52.33]Well... Unless I can find out a way why session, top, all these things that are sessions just do not work.
[413:07.46]How about recent follower?
[413:09.92]There.
[413:11.18]This is the most recent follower.
[413:19.17]Hey, comrade.
[413:19.91]Thanks for the recent follow.
[413:21.25]Appreciate it.
[413:22.13]Welcome to the channel.
[413:25.89]Alright, guys.
[413:26.31]I will see you tomorrow.
[413:30.94]Take care.
[413:32.12]We'll do the bits.
[413:45.52]Speaking of those things.
[413:49.08]Where are they?
[413:51.64]Hey, look, I found them.
[413:53.90]The unfollowed and the left.
[413:55.18]Oh, that's... That's sad.
[414:03.79]Why isn't the movie playing?
[414:04.95]Because the movie's over.
[414:05.77]I'm gonna start doing all my streams just inside of this theater.
[414:12.63]On the screen.
[414:17.53]Hey, Spooky Spitfire, thanks for the 250.
[414:19.09]Hey, Jerm, I'm still doing that Soulsborne Die Twice run, and I just beat Dark Souls 2.
[414:25.13]So now on to my own, my personal least favorite Souls game, Bloodborne.
[414:29.41]Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
[414:36.51]Your least favorite Souls game is Bloodborne?
[414:42.51]Oh, no.
[414:45.81]Alright.
[414:47.98]I would disagree with you.
[414:49.44]But, I mean, that's alright.
[414:52.56]Good luck through the rest of that.
[414:55.61]Also, most of the DLC has been completed in Dark Souls 1 and 2.
[414:59.35]What is Darkwood about?
[415:00.55]I've never heard of it before.
[415:01.37]It looks interesting.
[415:03.97]It is a game about living.
[415:06.96]Surviving in the forest.
[415:09.74]And there are cannibals that are eating people.
[415:15.10]and you may attack some of them, and they've been eating people.
[415:21.57]So that's why you did that, and that's why you've decided that that was a good idea.
[415:28.73]But it's kind of just like a trippy, you're in the woods, and there's like a lot of psychological things happening.
[415:35.93]And you have to be careful because at nighttime people come and try to kill you.
[415:39.66]They may have been eating people, which is what I thought.
[415:42.18]That they were all part of the same kind of cult of sickos.
[415:46.84]And I may have dropped a couple of them.
[415:49.46]But that's on me.
[415:51.58]Why are you in the woods?
[415:52.84]I don't know.
[415:56.40]That's a good question.
[416:02.20]But uh, good luck with the rest of your run, SpookySpitfire, thanks for the 250.
[416:04.58]Why do people do this?
[416:24.88]Wait, what?
[416:25.38]The title of this video is Jerma Eats Ass.
[417:06.87]This is supposed to be back here!
[417:09.17]Signed to confirm my age!
[417:17.58]What?
[417:20.70]It's because you titled the video Jerma Eats Ass.
[417:25.36]I can't watch it on stream through the browser source.
[417:37.34]Well, here.
[417:38.06]If anyone wants to see this, uh... These things are ridiculous looking, though.
[417:45.60]I couldn't do it.
[417:46.71]Ah!
[417:46.99]Ah!
[417:54.05]He forgot his password.
[417:55.57]I am, um... I've had it set up so I could watch them behind here.
[418:08.96]They're big and they're huge and they're going to crawl in my mouth and lay eggs in my mouth and down my throat.
[418:24.76]They actually are kind of cool looking though.
[418:33.45]I'm eating.
[418:36.84]Oh, sorry guys.
[418:38.15]Let me watch the stream and talk about all these things that the guy that I'm watching can't eat.
[418:44.51]Banana cream pie, pizza, go get a banana cream pie.
[418:47.25]Sorry, I said a bug was going to lay eggs down my throat and ruined your meal.
[418:52.29]Oh, boo hoo.
[418:56.54]I saw at least 200 banana cream pies in chat.
[419:02.88]And if you happen to be one of those people that did not say banana cream pie and you were eating now, I'm sorry.
[419:07.58]I do apologize.
[419:08.44]But there's been a war going on here for the last like hour and 45 minutes.
[419:12.47]I'm really sorry.
[419:22.37]But yeah, bearded dragons are cool.
[419:24.99]I'm still contemplating if I'm going to get one or not.
[419:30.44]Trying to figure out exactly how that would work.
[419:33.67]But they seem really fun.
[419:35.05]Seem like really interesting pets.
[419:38.47]But big desert ironclad beetles.
[419:45.49]That's a really interesting hobby, though.
[419:47.57]To collect stuff like that and have pets like that.
[419:51.09]To pets, as you say.
[419:53.58]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[419:57.25]Thank you, TheWileAld, TheWileAld, for the thousand bits.
[420:02.85]Try not to look at chat.
[420:03.73]Best part of this game is figuring it out.
[420:08.38]Yeah, it's true.
[420:10.54]But if I get stuck in the village, I need you to tell me where the mayor's house is.
[420:16.45]Otherwise, I'm going to be walking in a circle for 30 straight minutes, and I don't want to do that.
[420:23.40]I did say that backseating was okay for the streams just because it's one of those... It's one of those wiki games where... This stuff you just kind of... If you don't know then you just might be in trouble.
[420:38.57]Is that incorrect?
[420:43.13]Is it not?
[420:49.26]Like, if I sold something that was wrong, and later on I could use it for something else, this is 100% a game I would play with like 10 wiki tabs open.
[421:03.60]The game even says in the beginning, open up a wiki tab to help you, because it's not gonna hold your hand, but a wiki will.
[421:12.58]That was a part of the fine print at the bottom.
[421:23.35]No, backseating is okay for these streams.
[421:27.03]Just because I, sometimes I, especially with a game like this, I do run into a wall a few times and I need to be nudged in the right direction.
[421:33.37]So it's all good.
[421:36.30]Uh, but the while, the while old said, um, twice here, thousand bits in a row.
[421:44.34]So that's 2000 bits from the while old.
[421:47.85]They say, this is my jam.
[421:49.19]I believe it was acid base.
[421:54.86]It's a great song.
[421:57.30]Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[421:58.46]What's your favorite Jerma character?
[422:00.06]Me.
[422:03.64]I think I got it all.
[422:06.26]Strength.
[422:07.80]Intelligence.
[422:08.90]Agility.
[422:10.94]Friendship.
[422:12.02]You know, I'm very much a friendship kind of person.
[422:18.37]I can read at at least a 9th or 10th grade level.
[422:25.69]It's probably me.
[422:34.35]Or Glue Man's the easy answer there.
[422:39.91]Devakitty, thanks for the 250.
[422:40.91]Remember, the big dogs are easy enough.
[422:42.94]You just need to stop losing your cool.
[422:45.06]Whenever you miss any attack, you instantly get as tilted as the fucking leaning tower of pizza.
[422:56.41]Pizza, not pizza.
[423:01.73]I know, but that's why I need you guys to backseat and help me sometimes.
[423:06.12]Because I don't know, I just... Pizza's on the mind.
[423:22.95]Thank you for the $2.50.
[423:23.45]No, I agree.
[423:23.97]I 100% agree with you.
[423:27.30]Banana cream pizza.
[423:30.82]I wonder if I could make, like, a low FODMAP pizza.
[423:34.42]It would have to be with, like, a fake crust.
[423:36.67]Not real pizza crust.
[423:38.63]A sauce that didn't have any garlic in it.
[423:41.03]And just cheddar cheese all over it.
[423:42.45]It would be gross.
[423:48.54]Never mind.
[423:51.01]Uh, SpookySpitfire says, No, not really.
[424:01.45]My doctor wants to try a low FODMAP diet because I've been having some annoying symptoms that won't go away.
[424:10.66]And they may or may not even be related to my intestinal irritable bowel disease.
[424:18.18]We don't know.
[424:18.68]I may have developed more stuff since cresting over like 32, 33 years old.
[424:23.43]I have no idea.
[424:26.43]so we're doing a low fodmap diet for like a few weeks and we're gonna see what happens you should fire your doctor I don't think I want to do that yeah fodmap
[424:47.37]Essentially, it is a fermentable carbohydrate, from my understanding, that is in fructose.
[424:54.33]High fructose corn syrup is... I may as well be drinking poison if I have a FODMAP intolerance.
[425:01.01]Also, garlic and onions are absolute zero.
[425:04.81]Cannot have them ever.
[425:07.25]And that's the worst part, is garlic is in everything.
[425:09.89]Onion is in everything.
[425:10.73]Even if it's not physically on your plate, it is somehow in a seasoning blend.
[425:17.40]That's why I can't really eat out right now.
[425:26.89]Onion and garlic are... Garlic is seriously one of my favorite foods on Earth.
[425:30.78]It's unfortunate.
[425:33.62]Can't eat garlic.
[425:34.90]It is an incredibly concentrated place where FODMAPs come from.
[425:45.83]I can eat lettuce and meat.
[425:50.28]It's kind of like a low-carb diet, but you're not allowed to have onions and garlic.
[425:55.52]So a lot of bread is off the table.
[425:59.00]A lot of dairies off the table.
[426:01.36]A lot of... Like, I can be one of those people that eats a hamburger with a fork and a knife.
[426:06.96]I can have a patty and cheese with, like, mayo on it.
[426:10.71]And maybe a little bit of mustard and eat it with a fork and a knife.
[426:13.31]It's kind of like a low-carb, no bread sort of thing.
[426:16.49]And no garlic and no onions.
[426:18.03]And no fructose.
[426:18.85]No fructose corn syrup.
[426:20.25]I can eat sugar, though.
[426:21.49]So that's okay.
[426:21.87]Okay.
[426:26.52]So, we'll see what happens.
[426:27.36]I'm gonna let my doctor help me out here, and we'll see what he does.
[426:34.50]Hey, let's put the credits on the screen.
[426:41.68]Thank you, everybody.
[426:43.18]All the subs.
[426:44.22]We'll see you tomorrow.
[426:47.56]Here they come.
[426:50.99]There they are.
[426:53.07]And sign in to confirm your age needs to get off the screen as well.
[426:56.43]Because that's... Well, I don't know why that's still here.
[427:00.84]This movie sucks.
[427:01.80]But anyways, thank you CVFD721.
[427:07.66]Thank you, CVFD.
[427:09.85]For 2,500 bits.
[427:10.29]$25 total here from CVFD.
[427:22.04]They say, I feel pretty good.
[427:22.68]I feel pretty good.
[427:23.10]But thank you so much for the 2,500 bits.
[427:24.24]If you got me on at work,
[427:43.22]Just don't get fired.
[427:44.58]Because I've said, like... I've said, like, I shit in my diaper and stuff before.
[427:48.77]Just make sure you have headphones in.
[427:50.27]Don't accidentally have your chair get caught and pull the headphones out and it's like, I shit in a diaper.
[427:54.99]And then all of a sudden, like, all your co-workers are looking at you.
[428:01.11]I've said that exact phrase probably six or seven times.
[428:08.19]So, at that point, I've said, on stream and on camera, I've maybe... 16 to 17 billion words.
[428:16.54]So, how many words are in, I just shit in a... I just shit in a diaper?
[428:24.21]Six.
[428:25.43]So, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32... So, you're talking about there's a chance.
[428:29.49]I mean, you're talking about, like, maybe... Maybe, like, 42, 45 out of 17 or 18 billion.
[428:32.63]So...
[428:39.54]still possible be careful but thank you apple shift thanks to the 250 hey since Halloween is around the corner do you believe in ghosts if so have you ever seen one I do not believe in ghosts or what most people think of when they think of a ghost
[429:04.37]And I'm just gonna... I remember watching somebody talk about this before.
[429:08.57]I think there was like a comedian or somebody that talked about this.
[429:11.84]But it's true.
[429:14.06]If there were ghosts, where are they all gonna go?
[429:17.18]You know how many hundreds and hundreds of millions of people that have passed away?
[429:23.97]You know, there are billions of people that have probably died.
[429:25.87]Are they just walking around in your house?
[429:29.35]Are there like 700-800 people in this house right now?
[429:33.64]Walking around as a ghost?
[429:38.08]That would mean not everyone becomes a ghost.
[429:39.82]Well, why do you become a ghost?
[429:44.10]What makes you allowed to be a ghost?
[429:56.87]They watch over you.
[430:00.34]Alright, well, let's just say, like, my great-great-grand, like, papa is watching over me right now.
[430:07.16]Is his great-great-great-grand papa watching over him, too?
[430:10.64]Like, in the same spot?
[430:13.41]Making sure he doesn't screw up?
[430:20.50]is it just a line of somebody watching somebody else watching somebody else watching somebody else no he went to the afterlife how long do you have to watch somebody before you get to go is that part of like the criteria to watch for like 20 years you have to tag out you have to tag out
[430:52.29]I'd get bored in five minutes.
[430:54.73]I don't wanna- I don't wanna do that.
[431:01.80]That does not sound like a great time to me.
[431:06.02]So my, like, great grandchild, I'm sitting there to watch him?
[431:12.12]What about like 2.30 in the morning when they're in the bathroom eating boogers and they're like 40?
[431:17.28]I don't wanna watch that.
[431:26.16]Do I have to watch every time that my, like, great-great-great-grand, uh, nephew, like, grandson, like, goes to the bathroom?
[431:34.31]Do I just not?
[431:35.21]No, no, no!
[431:42.16]He's, like, taking a dump down there?
[431:49.10]I clock out?
[431:51.06]Alright, I'm gonna clock out for, like, for, like, ten minutes.
[431:55.35]You only get one break, or two breaks during the day, you come back and they're still taking a shit.
[432:00.21]You're like, God damn it.
[432:04.74]I thought you'd be done by now.
[432:07.70]The nine to, you have to go sleep?
[432:16.71]You have a ghost bed.
[432:19.41]You don't sleep, you have to watch that person sleeping all night.
[432:24.91]Got news for you.
[432:26.11]There ain't no Nintendo Switch up there.
[432:29.65]It's you and binoculars looking at your great-great-grandson sleeping.
[432:43.24]You don't get to go to sleep?
[432:46.62]Oh, and he's watching over me.
[432:51.02]And you hear like a gust of wind.
[432:55.90]That was him.
[433:00.38]He's telling me something.
[433:03.83]I heard a wind gust at the door at the bathroom.
[433:05.97]Yeah, it's called get out of the bathroom.
[433:07.57]I'm trying to get you to do something else.
[433:12.07]You know those house noises you hear that are like... That's your great-great-grandfather trying to get you to do something else.
[433:21.18]Because you're boring the shit out of him.
[433:29.31]What kind of house do you live in?
[433:33.33]There's lightning outside.
[433:36.58]That's somebody's great-great-great-grandfather annoyed that they've been in the bathroom for too long.
[433:42.76]That's what lightning is.
[434:07.09]Okay, we have to move on.
[434:08.09]It's gone.
[434:08.59]It's gone.
[434:09.23]It went there.
[434:09.63]I was trying to avoid it, but it went there.
[434:11.82]I gotta move on.
[434:19.42]The great-great-great-grandfather won't even understand what a phone is.
[434:22.44]Like, no one's gonna tell them.
[434:27.74]Who's gonna tell them what a phone is?
[434:30.24]Imagine, like, your great-great-great-great caveman grandfather.
[434:35.58]No, he's gonna be swinging his club around up there, trying to, like, hit your great-great-great, like, World War I grandfather with, like, a club.
[434:43.36]It's chaos up there.
[434:44.60]He doesn't know what a phone is.
[434:58.25]They all have to teach each other everything again.
[435:01.38]You have to teach the great, great, great caveman grandfather all of human history for them to understand.
[435:08.93]And then you need to be taught by the person in front of you, generation, what the television is.
[435:14.15]I do not envy that situation.
[435:28.96]Constant conflict up in Guardian Ghost Land.
[435:35.01]What is cloud gaming?
[435:40.41]Cloud gaming?
[435:41.93]What cloud gaming?
[435:44.81]Me hit rabbit in head with club.
[435:48.55]Okay.
[435:51.30]Did you spin that guy around and like make him walk in another direction?
[436:03.48]Just go that way for like 400,000 miles, because it doesn't exist.
[436:07.58]Distance is completely relative.
[436:09.42]It does not even exist.
[436:11.68]You could have great, great, great, great, great caveman.
[436:14.17]I mean, let's be real.
[436:15.33]Not going to add very much to the conversation.
[436:17.37]So just point him in a direction and tell him to walk.
[436:20.03]And tell him that there's like a nice, crunchy rabbit like 200 million miles that way.
[436:25.83]At least he'll get some peace and quiet for a while.
[436:33.14]You assume he can understand.
[436:36.34]Well, at some point, there's got to be like a mutiny.
[436:38.16]They've got to get rid of him.
[436:40.98]I would assume they have some type of hierarchy.
[436:44.52]Who gets to be the king, great-great-great-grandmother, great-great-great-grandfather ghost?
[436:49.26]Who gets to tell the other ghosts what to do?
[436:53.92]It's probably... The caveman is going to be the first one.
[436:58.38]So there's going to be like an uprising.
[437:01.30]And they'll just find a way to get rid of him.
[437:06.76]It would be the oldest.
[437:07.50]That's exactly what I'm saying.
[437:10.35]They would not have any time at all to watch over you.
[437:14.39]Because great, great, great caveman grandfather is going to tell everybody they need to find pebbles and trade teeth and stuff.
[437:23.21]And they're not going to have time to watch you go to the bathroom.
[437:31.87]He's going to kill him again.
[437:36.16]Again, and he goes up another level.
[437:38.72]It's like Inception.
[437:40.32]He goes up another level.
[437:44.08]They're killing each other up there.
[437:46.06]What?
[437:59.14]Getting even stronger.
[438:02.79]Anyways.
[438:06.19]Thank you to Cyrus Dexter for the 251 bits.
[438:09.14]Appreciate it.
[438:11.38]And Apple Shift, thanks for the 250.
[438:12.60]And no, I do not believe in ghosts in the traditional sense.
[438:22.48]I mean, could there be such thing as like a spirit or a soul or something that electromagnetically is still around after a while and maybe like after a while?
[438:32.51]I don't know, guys.
[438:33.61]I'm of the opinion that it's possible that when you die, you know, when you dream, your brain activity slows down, right?
[438:40.85]To a point where I might think about this.
[438:44.67]If your brain activity slows down to a point,
[438:47.50]where it's so slow and you're shutting down 10 minutes in real life might be like 6,000 years.
[438:55.96]You might live like 50,000 more lifetimes in like a dream world because your brain's slowing down so much.
[439:03.61]That might happen.
[439:13.47]This is a Black Mirror episode.
[439:16.82]I'm just, I don't know.
[439:18.42]I don't know.
[439:22.42]What if your head is destroyed?
[439:24.22]That's the thing.
[439:25.20]Time is relative to when that person is experiencing time.
[439:29.96]Because, well, let's say you go have surgery, right?
[439:33.96]When you go get put under by, you know, the anesthesiologist,
[439:38.36]Oh, hey, okay, it's time for me to do this.
[439:41.24]I just woke up.
[439:44.18]Twelve hours may have gone by.
[439:46.56]Time is relative to who is experiencing it.
[439:56.18]So, who's to say that if your brain activity slows down, ten minutes could be just ten hours to you?
[440:06.09]So by the time that they actually bring you to a funeral home or a crematorium, you're talking about could be like a couple of days, which could be two to three hundred years.
[440:20.32]I'm going right for the caveman, I'll tell you.
[440:28.77]I'm sprinting at caveman.
[440:32.57]I'm going to be the new king up there.
[440:39.22]It's gonna be hard though, because there's gonna be like 5,000 other people there.
[440:43.69]Just like, it's gonna be like a train.
[440:45.43]You're gonna be like on a train.
[440:52.21]I'm gonna be the king of ghost land.
[440:53.92]Yes, you'll see.
[440:54.86]I have to go.
[441:02.44]Banana crematorium pie.
[441:04.24]Nice.
[441:04.68]Okay.
[441:11.82]Thank you archive.png for the thousand bits.
[441:16.67]They say, hey Jerma, I've been starting making an archive of your streams, which has the chat in view.
[441:22.23]got 16 full streams with the chat up so far right now these archives aren't worth that much to anyone but I think there might be a lot of people who are glad they can watch old Jerma streams and see the chat in the future gives you an additional perspective on the streams at least you can find this archive by searching it on youtube and by sorting by date by the way there is a channel that archives every stream I've ever done but they don't do the chat on it
[441:51.23]He's gonna take it down.
[441:52.75]I think you overestimate how much I care about that.
[442:02.80]There is an archive channel that actually does that, but not with chat, I don't think.
[442:11.39]There is a JermaStreams archive.
[442:17.74]Mean to him?
[442:18.54]What?
[442:18.84]No, I'm just, I'm saying that I'm, that doesn't bother me.
[442:21.86]It's not like a, wait, hold on a minute.
[442:23.97]You're taking my content and you're putting it up on your channel?
[442:37.49]I'll take it down.
[442:38.15]They're monopolizing my humor.
[442:40.05]What?
[442:40.37]They're monopolizing off of my humor.
[442:44.70]More of my royalties.
[442:47.71]Because I know what YouTube pays.
[442:53.93]If I was to really go after somebody for potentially making, like, let's say a video like that got, like, five to, like, three, four, five thousand views, am I really gonna go after somebody for, like, fucking three dollars?
[443:23.36]probably yes yes that's mick chicken money but that's something one of the like the whole like copyright infringement and copy striking and and content id and stuff it's like really do you like that seems like way too much effort to try to spend like 60 days to make like 12 dollars
[443:54.64]YouTube does not pay what it used to.
[444:05.42]Depends on the context.
[444:08.10]Okay, right.
[444:08.90]So let me give you an example if somebody were to make a video of my voice doing something terrible or Making it look like I did something was said something that I didn't do that was incredibly awful Like actually crossing the line for something like truly crossing the line and you all know what the things like I could be referring to and That video had a shitload of views it would be like, okay, what do I do here?
[444:36.33]I
[444:45.50]Deep fake of you eating boogers.
[444:51.09]But... No.
[444:52.81]If... If... Let's put it this way.
[444:55.90]If somebody were to ever make a video...
[444:59.55]about like my stream or something or me or like you look this I have no leg to stand on here I I put out into the wild six straight hours of green screen footage am I you're gonna I think I'm gonna I'm gonna copyright strike people it's over at this point I'm royalty free throughout
[445:25.48]A half a day's worth of grain screen stuff, which, by the way, I guess I'll announce it right now.
[445:31.76]I'm going to get back in front of that screen very soon.
[445:35.48]We're going to do a part two.
[445:42.96]Too much interesting stuff has come out of that that it would be a shame if I didn't add DLC.
[445:47.97]Right?
[445:50.35]Free DLC, by the way.
[445:51.71]It's just going to put it up again.
[445:56.91]So we'll do, after Halloween, we will compile some more stuff that you guys want me to do in front of that screen.
[446:04.60]And I'll do another, like, four, five, six hours in front of the green screen.
[446:14.54]But no, I've... That doesn't, I don't, that does not bother me.
[446:18.09]I don't, that doesn't, I don't get into that.
[446:22.39]If you want to make a video or something on something that I've done or said...
[446:27.24]Or you want to use green screen footage.
[446:29.08]That's your shit.
[446:30.12]Like, I don't... That doesn't bother me.
[446:31.72]It's not like, oh, well, hold on a minute there.
[446:35.62]I don't want you to use that JoJo dance in that video.
[446:42.34]But... That kind of goes all around in a circle there.
[446:48.31]No, I have an archived channel.
[446:50.35]I don't have one, but I have like a sort of unofficially yesed on an archived channel.
[446:58.80]they don't do chat maybe it'll be worth seeing if if people do people really want that that badly or should the streams on that archive stay that way we want chat we want it well let me ask a question or two
[447:23.55]Am I gonna stream the entire green screen?
[447:26.75]Yeah.
[447:28.03]Like we did last time.
[447:32.84]The exact same thing we did last time, but just a bunch of new actions.
[447:37.88]Thank you, Producesan.
[447:43.22]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[447:45.42]I'm not kidding you, the first stream I ever saw of yours was the Carnival stream, so I'm relatively new.
[447:50.62]Welcome, first of all, if you're still here.
[447:52.95]But I've known about you for a while, thanks to Joel and Vinny.
[447:55.41]You three have been keeping me going these past couple months.
[447:58.25]It's been rough trying to figure out where I am in life, but you making me laugh is more than enough to let me know it's going to be alright.
[448:05.31]Thank you for even stopping by this channel.
[448:06.95]The other two people that you mentioned there are absolutely fantastic streamers.
[448:14.31]They're some of the best, I would say.
[448:19.12]So, thank you for even putting me into that category with those two.
[448:26.56]I'm glad you found the stream.
[448:29.81]Hopefully you have fun here.
[448:31.85]Hopefully you have enough laughs.
[448:36.57]Enough chill time here.
[448:38.79]Is really all I want.
[448:43.84]So thank you.
[448:45.34]And say hello to Vinny and Joel for me.
[448:48.15]Next time you see them.
