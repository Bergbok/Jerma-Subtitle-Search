[00:59.22]God damn it.
[01:01.12]I put my phone down into this, like, ugh.
[01:04.44]Jesus.
[01:04.82]So I have like a drink here.
[01:08.23]It's a drink that's making a lot of condensation.
[01:10.47]What is it about coffees that makes an extreme amount of condensation?
[01:15.71]No other drink I ever buy, like, you've got a Gatorade, you've got a bottle with plastic, you know, it's a coffee.
[01:20.70]Just sweats, just, it's like turning a faucet on.
[01:24.36]I bought a Dunkin' Donuts coffee and this thing is literally bleeding.
[01:27.12]It's been bleeding the whole time.
[01:29.53]Sitting on my desk and there's a puddle here and I just put my phone down thinking there's a fucking gonna be wood there.
[01:33.87]Boink.
[01:34.51]Directly into water.
[01:38.03]No other drink does that.
[01:39.81]I've had plenty of drink.
[01:43.17]Yeah, I've had plenty of drinks before in my life.
[01:46.19]No holes in the cup, it's just sweating.
[01:49.87]Somebody stabbed this coffee three times.
[01:52.41]Good afternoon, good evening, hi guys.
[01:54.24]Welcome to another stream.
[01:56.84]My name's... You know my name by now, who cares?
[02:01.50]We're gonna finish, hopefully tonight, Dark Messiah.
[02:05.20]I feel like we're only a few hours out, two or three hours out to beat the game.
[02:09.05]So we're gonna try to beat it.
[02:12.55]Mmm!
[02:15.90]Ugh.
[02:17.52]Your name is Jerma's son.
[02:19.96]Well, I don't know how that's possible, considering I don't have any kids.
[02:25.43]You'd be the first.
[02:27.57]But let me just finish getting ready, and we'll get started.
[02:30.03]We're going to get right where we left off.
[02:32.09]See you in a minute.
[03:18.83]Alright.
[03:20.25]Thank you to all the subs that are rolling in.
[03:24.40]Very much appreciated.
[03:26.94]Hey, your friend, Holy Mackerel, just started watching.
[03:29.74]Hey!
[03:31.68]What a cool fucking feature.
[03:35.54]This, let me move that.
[03:36.46]Let's get this turned off.
[03:37.75]We don't need to see this anymore.
[03:38.95]We need to see this.
[03:41.19]This.
[03:42.73]Get that audio there.
[03:43.79]Yes, we do.
[03:44.57]Okie dokie.
[03:47.63]Smokey.
[03:49.55]Okie dokie.
[03:51.12]Smokey.
[03:52.80]Minimize this window.
[03:54.68]Pull this up.
[03:56.02]And now we're ready to play.
[03:58.26]Dark Messiah of my magic.
[04:02.95]If you didn't catch the last stream... Wait.
[04:08.49]What?
[04:10.40]Wasn't I in like an orc building?
[04:12.17]Am I gonna go this way?
[04:14.29]Where do we leave off?
[04:18.73]Why can I not open this door?
[04:22.85]I felt like I was in a building, wasn't I?
[04:24.12]I guess I'm going this way from, I guess.
[04:30.64]No, I don't think I need to be going this way.
[04:36.00]Alright, well, okay.
[04:38.71]I fell off a cliff, but what cliff did I fall off?
[04:44.85]It's this way, it's this way.
[04:45.79]I remember the bananas.
[05:04.54]This game is fucking perfect.
[05:10.48]Alright, I believe we're going the right way.
[05:12.62]Let me just get a sneak down there.
[05:15.12]No, no, sneak over here.
[05:17.04]This is the orc building.
[05:18.06]I remember I was like, what do I do over here?
[05:19.54]And I picked up this mushroom.
[05:22.35]And then we went down here.
[05:26.99]Good work, chat.
[05:28.77]Hey, good work, chatters.
[05:33.80]Yep, I remember this.
[05:35.26]This is where I died.
[05:37.68]We ain't gonna die again.
[05:39.26]We're gonna clear this place of the Orcish Horde.
[05:45.28]What the fuck just happened?
[05:49.91]What happened?
[05:54.03]I... What hit me?
[05:57.23]What happened?
[05:57.73]I don't understand.
[06:04.20]I gotta run.
[06:10.19]Never going to die again.
[06:14.37]This sword is so good.
[06:15.23]I'm so glad I found the fucking secret.
[06:16.53]Alright, that thing drops.
[06:19.11]And that's where I died last time.
[06:20.53]We ain't gonna die there again.
[06:21.47]Alright, we're gonna do America's Funniest Home Video on this guy.
[06:29.85]What a fucking funny home video.
[06:33.20]Did I get him?
[06:34.66]Easy.
[06:38.34]What?
[06:41.76]Stranger!
[06:43.12]That guy was supposed to like plead with me to not... Oh, no, no, no!
[06:45.40]Okay, I killed an orc up here, right?
[06:47.83]That was supposed to help me?
[06:53.09]This fucking sword is incredible, by the way.
[06:57.35]This is by far the best weapon in the game.
[07:01.69]Let's go up here.
[07:03.33]Anything?
[07:03.83]Nah.
[07:06.59]What is that?
[07:08.39]It's a tool chest coming down the shares What the fuck was that what just happened to you?
[07:28.02]What the fuck was that?
[07:31.50]Why oh god oh?
[07:37.21]I have no idea what the fuck that was.
[07:40.17]Oh, no.
[07:41.23]I was trying to make my home alone joke.
[07:45.77]Okay, now we can go.
[07:48.57]We have safety.
[07:49.23]That sounded like a tool chest falling down the stairs.
[07:56.94]I got home alone.
[07:57.64]The stairs.
[08:03.64]It was an exclamation.
[08:04.50]I'm sorry.
[08:05.30]Sometimes I exclaim things.
[08:13.09]More like dork messiah?
[08:14.55]Come on, you can do better than that, guys.
[08:16.65]Come on, man, you can do better than that.
[08:19.52]You can do better than that.
[08:26.88]And another little entryway.
[08:28.80]More frog's legs.
[08:32.26]Don't need those right now.
[08:35.71]I hear noises.
[08:38.33]That's wood, right?
[08:39.39]That's technically wood.
[08:42.07]Yeah, that is technically... This way, please.
[08:54.32]Alrighty.
[08:55.06]And then we jump to this.
[08:56.92]Bring out our fucking war sword.
[09:00.99]Is it time for Fool and Run?
[09:01.93]No, the time for Fool and Run is over.
[09:03.29]We have to beat Dark Messiah tonight.
[09:06.29]I have to beat this game tonight.
[09:08.45]Otherwise, can I really be considered a fucking 2000s gamer?
[09:14.29]Breathtaking, isn't it?
[09:15.91]And once you recover the skull and free your father, it will all be yours.
[09:20.94]Perhaps even without your father.
[09:24.50]One impossible quest at a time, Santa.
[09:27.21]Yes, my prince.
[09:29.39]I'm not gonna be homesick for that temple.
[09:31.31]Do I have to... I'm ready to go here.
[09:34.75]I think I have to scoop around here.
[09:37.50]24-hour stream incoming.
[09:38.46]No, I... How am I gonna call myself a fucking 2000s gamer?
[09:41.30]Because, like, all we play on this channel is games that came out in, like, 2007.
[09:44.18]How am I ever... I have to jump to this?
[09:52.84]I fucked it up.
[09:54.37]God damn it.

[11:34.13]Well, you just told me I can't do it, so now I'm gonna do it.
[11:38.88]Now that's what I like to call an ape escape.
[11:44.56]I can't turn.
[11:44.92]Alright.

[12:15.85]We're gonna get bombarded by that fucking Greyjoy ship.
[12:19.13]Watch out for the fucking Greyjoys.
[12:20.81]They're on pike.
[12:22.19]They're a Game of Thrones family.
[12:24.45]They have the best navy in the fucking world.
[12:27.62]Be careful.
[12:29.32]I'm going back to Stonehelm, to the Necromancer lairs under the city.
[12:32.28]And when I get there, I will find Erentir and kill him.
[12:35.89]My lord, we will follow you.
[12:38.17]And so you begin to build your army.
[12:40.87]Do I have to build an army?
[12:41.87]That's kind of cool.
[12:49.87]I'm promoting alcohol?
[12:50.89]What are you talking about?
[12:56.03]Cold one.
[12:56.63]Into the necromancer's lair.
[12:59.79]Why does a cold one have to be alcohol?
[13:04.62]Hold on a second.
[13:05.04]Let me get... Oh, wait a minute.
[13:06.08]Let me get Diddy Kong out of this thing.
[13:07.94]Yeah, there he is.
[13:10.14]Hold on a minute.
[13:10.54]Oh, I lost a life.
[13:11.56]It's okay.

[13:50.78]Alright, guys.
[13:53.12]Hold on.
[13:53.38]Let me just clear these idiots.
[13:56.46]I gotta fix my fucking hotbar.

[14:01.02]So, hold on.
[14:03.29]Uh, I need heal.
[14:05.41]Gotta have my freeze.

[14:12.00]Okay, everything seems to be in order.
[14:14.56]Alright.
[14:15.70]And this is where we start spotting the Cyclopses!
[14:22.28]Everything seems to be in working order!
[14:26.66]Come on, get him!
[14:32.57]Get him!
[14:33.21]Crush his head!
[14:33.79]Don't worry, I'll shovel him!

[14:57.73]That was your joke, it's over.
[14:59.09]We can go back to playing.
[15:01.77]That was a bad joke.
[15:02.47]It wasn't really a joke.
[15:03.21]It was more like... Holy shit.
[15:09.28]This thing really is the fucking best weapon in the game, isn't it?
[15:11.20]Can I, like, destroy this?
[15:16.35]What happens if I go in this?
[15:17.71]Is it going to take me, like, to fucking Outlands?
[15:21.71]What the fuck?
[15:28.75]Whoa!
[15:30.65]There's a guy here.
[15:31.49]Alright, we went in the Kool-Aid portal.
[15:45.12]Can I send him, like, out?
[15:46.02]Hold on, I'm gonna try to, like, send this guy through.
[15:49.46]Will he go through the gate if he slips through?
[15:50.88]No, of course not.
[15:57.80]Get out of my fucking face.
[16:02.38]Did I hear something?
[16:08.91]Keep going.
[16:10.05]Keep going.
[16:11.53]You know what?
[16:11.85]Just fuck it.
[16:12.21]I gotta kill this guy.
[16:12.91]I don't want him to cause any problems for me.
[16:17.13]One click and he's dead.
[16:18.09]You guys thought I was gonna be underleveled.
[16:19.37]This place is huge.
[16:21.01]More territory to conquer, that's all.
[16:23.39]Everybody thought I was gonna be underleveled for this shit.
[16:28.15]I'm one hit killing these people right now.
[16:30.70]Look for signs on the walls to help find your way.
[16:32.76]Great.
[16:35.22]Oh, let's go.
[16:42.50]One click, man.
[16:43.34]Alright, this is where we get to spot the necromancer.
[16:48.02]There it is.
[16:48.46]There's his chamber.
[16:50.12]Let's make our way down and fight these fucking necrotomicons.
[16:58.21]I can't open that door.
[17:01.24]Are we gonna get a new enemy introduced here?
[17:02.72]I feel like we are.
[17:04.68]And it is scary.
[17:07.88]Oh, look at that.
[17:08.64]We got, like, fucking propaganda everywhere.
[17:10.04]Look at these fucking propaganda banners.
[17:12.90]Have to get rid of those.
[17:21.23]Eat this, you propaganda!
[17:25.03]I don't know.
[17:25.93]I've gone.
[17:26.65]I've already lost control.
[17:28.21]It's been fucking 10 minutes.
[17:29.77]I'm already gone.
[17:30.61]Okay, there's an item over there.
[17:43.52]I'm hearing the whispers of the old gods.
[17:45.26]Okay, chest and an item.
[17:48.64]Mana potion and what was... There's something sparkling on this.
[17:52.74]Am I out of my mind?
[17:57.82]I guess not.
[17:58.66]Okay.
[17:59.90]Let's keep going.
[18:02.18]10 minutes already.
[18:03.24]God.
[18:07.37]I need to get like a stealth kill on somebody.
[18:09.03]It's not going to happen.
[18:11.11]Why would I care about stealth kills when I can one-click man people?
[18:17.70]Why the hell would I do anything else?
[18:19.18]This is the new kick.
[18:22.20]Wow!
[18:22.76]You've actually... That's the best enemy in the game.
[18:28.89]Oh, shit.
[18:30.71]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[18:31.61]I actually have, like, fucking scary enemies.
[18:40.05]Okay.
[18:48.15]Get shocked.
[18:49.05]Knock his head off.
[18:51.77]There it is.
[18:58.18]Keep it moving.
[19:01.82]That's the best enemy in the game.
[19:03.48]Gets one clicked, man.
[19:07.31]Okay, let's go for a joke here, right?
[19:11.09]I didn't even throw that.
[19:11.87]Okay, hold on.
[19:12.51]Come on, this is going to be like a science class joke I can make, right?
[19:19.72]Ah, come on.
[19:20.74]Science class.
[19:22.18]Hey, take this hydrochloric acid.
[19:27.36]And a fucking one punch man.
[19:29.18]What a joke.
[19:36.90]And then take this fucking peanut butter that's way over the expiration date.
[19:49.71]Let's go.
[19:52.95]$10 joke.
[19:54.69]No, that wasn't a $10 joke.
[19:58.69]That was me pretending to make a $10 joke.
[20:01.61]And it turned out to be like a $2... Is that guy alive?
[20:05.59]Well, I'm not pulling that yet.
[20:06.73]Let's get to a position where I know I'm gonna be fine.
[20:14.78]I owe you guys money for that one.
[20:18.10]Pulling that makes them all come out, so... What?
[20:22.26]What?
[20:27.46]Okay, he's dead.
[20:29.18]Maybe I have to pull that open.
[20:32.08]What a fucking idiot.
[20:36.98]Come on, really?
[20:39.32]Being blocked by the propaganda?
[20:51.41]The fucking propaganda saved that guy's life.
[21:00.60]Come on, get shocked.
[21:01.38]I think I should just go open those doors.
[21:05.88]I feel like there's probably something there.
[21:14.10]What is that?
[21:15.02]No, no books.
[21:16.04]No, like, fucking grimoires.
[21:18.88]Chapter three.
[21:19.38]We already beat chapter three.
[21:20.38]We don't even need to read this shit.
[21:21.46]That happened a long time ago.
[21:27.40]Singular attack human.
[21:29.90]Oh, there's plenty of fucking blimberry juice.
[21:33.32]Bottle of berry, where is, there it is, right?
[21:38.15]Okay, let's go.
[21:41.19]This place is actually fairly large, so I hope I don't get lost.
[21:48.34]Did I change build between streams?
[21:49.94]I did not, this is the same exact character that I was playing before.
[21:55.20]Only I have two very, very good items.
[21:58.62]That I'm not technically utilizing the best, or am I?
[22:01.63]I don't know.
[22:01.97]I'm gonna be crying behind this door.
[22:08.57]So is that lady dead?
[22:10.55]That lady, Leanna?
[22:11.33]Or is she alive?
[22:18.57]Where is he?
[22:21.65]Come on up here.
[22:26.07]I have a chance to joke this guy.
[22:31.28]Oh, come on.
[22:31.82]Really?
[22:32.94]I had such a huge potential to joke you.
[22:37.42]I'm trying to get him in midair.
[22:39.92]That would have been pretty good.
[22:41.70]Didn't get it, though.
[22:42.64]Oh, well.
[22:43.30]I tried.
[22:49.75]Not even utilizing his weapons in it.
[22:51.67]Hold on.
[22:52.03]Is this like a fucking demon door?
[22:54.99]Is he going to start talking to me?
[22:57.38]Why won't this open?
[22:59.22]What?
[22:59.60]Oh, God.
[22:59.80]That's so funny.
[23:00.34]I don't know how I opened this door.
[23:02.62]I must not have done something.
[23:05.78]Alright, so I gotta go back and pull the lever.
[23:07.80]Wait, that... Wait.
[23:08.74]That was the door I went through?
[23:11.79]Why were there enemies over there?
[23:12.57]There weren't people back there before.
[23:28.10]There weren't enemies down there before.
[23:29.22]Is this the start of the level?
[23:32.86]What?
[23:33.98]What the fuck?
[23:34.60]There were like enemies that were there.
[23:36.28]Who are these?
[23:36.84]These guys weren't here before.
[23:37.89]I killed all those people.
[23:43.57]You guys know that.
[23:49.03]I went in a circle.
[23:49.89]I don't even... How the fuck did that happen?
[23:53.27]This is the start of the game.
[23:57.27]Alright, well, let's go pull that lever then.
[24:03.02]Am I on a cheating spiral?
[24:04.04]Yeah, I did go in a circle.
[24:05.32]Fuck me.
[24:05.78]Alright, well.
[24:11.98]There's that.
[24:12.52]Alright, I need to get down there and pull the lever.
[24:16.76]Slide down like fucking... Slide down like in Rush Hour 2.
[24:21.55]You just slide on the sheet.
[24:25.83]Good.
[24:27.78]Alright, let's pull this lever and get, like, killed.
[24:37.62]Come on.
[24:38.68]Where'd they go?
[24:41.35]Really?
[24:49.95]Is it only one guy that I did this to?
[25:00.01]Why was I preparing for the worst?
[25:04.76]I don't know why.
[25:05.32]There was nothing even down here besides, like, some, like, chicken bones.
[25:11.52]Ooh!
[25:16.24]What?
[25:18.09]Die.
[25:20.95]Stop it.
[25:21.33]He's already dead.
[25:24.51]Ah, nothing in here.
[25:25.05]Just a bunch of fucking chicken bones, guys.
[25:28.91]Okay, I think this is where I gotta go.
[25:34.08]These guys hurt, by the way.
[25:39.32]Ow.
[25:44.90]Come on, hit him.
[25:46.10]Swing at him.
[25:51.50]Got him.
[25:55.18]I still hear somebody.
[25:59.30]I mean, like, was there nothing in here?
[26:02.80]What was the point of opening this shit?
[26:06.72]What?
[26:06.88]You're telling me there was no point in opening that?
[26:14.20]Well, we're gonna go this way.
[26:21.20]And in here, there's a chest.
[26:24.49]Of course, I, like... Hold on, I electrocuted that guy?
[26:27.73]That guy wasn't even close.
[26:31.86]This dude was... I blocked his fireball and it fucking electrocuted him.
[26:36.48]He has a direct connection with his fireballs.
[26:40.84]Give me an item.
[26:43.14]No, nothing.
[26:45.10]Well, shit.
[26:49.82]Shit!
[26:56.00]Something to do with this stuff?
[26:56.98]Like the stained glass?
[27:02.87]He has a direct Wi-Fi connection.
[27:04.59]I think I found the right way.
[27:16.14]Is this a bad guy?
[27:16.82]This guy's holding a brick.
[27:20.52]I don't know if that... I think that was just a butler.
[27:25.33]I don't think that guy was bad.
[27:26.43]Whoops.
[27:40.08]Follow me!
[27:47.89]Dude, that is a broken nose.
[27:50.09]That's a fucking shattered skull, a broken nose, a broken back.
[27:53.69]God damn it.
[28:01.54]Endless quiver and a health potion.
[28:03.36]No, I don't need any of this shit.
[28:07.56]Stream Arkham Knight?
[28:10.20]I don't know.
[28:10.58]I don't know if I would want to do that.
[28:13.21]I think those Batman games are really, really great games, but I feel like that they're old enough now.
[28:18.03]Library and training area.
[28:19.79]They're old enough now, and they're, like, so... Like, everyone's done them, and they're very fun.
[28:24.15]I feel like I played Shadow of Mordor, you know what I mean?
[28:40.98]Am I a bad person, right?
[28:42.55]I think I'm a bad person.
[28:47.25]This is fucking Leonardo da Vinci's, like, very famous painting.
[28:50.93]And he, like, turns himself into, like, fucking six arms and shit.
[28:53.75]Get that fucking propaganda out of here.
[28:59.31]But I am the bad guy.
[29:00.35]What am I talking about?
[29:01.01]I turned into, like, a demon and shit.
[29:11.18]I got somebody chained up over here?
[29:17.68]I moved behind the wall.
[29:20.84]You think I'm gonna try to run?
[29:23.81]Oh, he fell a long way.
[29:28.35]I can fall a long way here.
[29:30.11]There's a lot of enemies here.
[29:35.46]I gotta be careful.
[29:42.27]Two down.
[29:42.67]A few more to go.
[29:47.81]Cut him off this way.
[29:48.79]Alright, let me block his bullet and then let him... He's gonna... Wait, this is gonna be funny.
[30:01.66]Where the fuck did he go?
[30:02.48]Alright, I gotta stop.
[30:07.14]Just fucking... Just shock him.
[30:08.50]Electrocute him.
[30:09.26]He's dead.
[30:13.48]Look at that guy's beard.
[30:14.38]This guy's awesome.
[30:18.55]Oh, I'm on top of him.
[30:27.45]Whoops.
[30:32.66]Okay, we're good.
[30:35.44]Kick him dead.
[30:36.72]Not a big deal.
[30:39.27]That was a jumping slash.
[30:45.15]This game is fun.
[30:46.47]This is a fun game.
[30:47.57]This game came out like in fucking 2006.
[30:49.21]And the anals of the dead, I don't care about anal.
[30:53.88]I don't care about any like anals of history, annals of history, whatever.
[30:59.62]You know what I'm trying to say.
[31:03.07]Can I make the jump is my question though.
[31:07.47]Of course I can.
[31:08.83]Think I can fucking make that jump?
[31:11.77]Let me jump down here.
[31:12.69]Whoa!
[31:14.85]I think there was a staircase, actually, but that's alright.
[31:23.66]Almost down at ground level.
[31:25.22]And a series of doors.
[31:30.15]Anything up here?
[31:34.42]And thank you, Kane, for the bits.
[31:36.36]Also, Gray.
[31:37.06]Thanks to all the people that are... I almost just said streamers.
[31:40.52]Thanks to all the streamers.
[31:43.10]Thanks to all the subs that are coming in, too.
[31:46.75]Very much appreciate it.
[31:47.45]Also, Alex James, thanks for the bits as well.
[31:52.49]I need you to tell my friend Adam that he needs to pay his crab tax.
[31:56.75]Unless he gets a visit from the crab men again.
[32:00.18]Well... Everybody's got to pay taxes, man.
[32:06.65]Everybody's got to pay taxes.
[32:12.73]Let's save this.
[32:13.51]There's a guy hanging.
[32:15.61]Is that guy still alive?
[32:19.99]Are they shooting at this guy?
[32:22.81]What are they attacking?
[32:25.59]Oh, I'll give him something to attack.
[32:30.75]We're gonna fucking just spawn.
[32:31.83]You know, let's just spawn fucking goblins too.
[32:33.53]I know, while we're at it.
[32:35.67]This is the arena.
[32:41.48]Who's gonna win?
[32:44.46]Get off me!
[32:45.08]Why are the goblins attacking me?
[32:53.80]Oh, this one guy's still here.
[32:55.12]I would have retreated by now, dude.
[33:03.68]Take this!
[33:06.44]Wait, what?
[33:06.92]Did I?
[33:08.16]Where did he go?
[33:09.98]Oh my god.
[33:11.06]Oh my god, that's fucking terrible.
[33:14.62]What have I done?
[33:15.66]Cut him down.
[33:16.76]Cut this guy down.
[33:18.32]Cut him down.
[33:21.38]I can't cut him down.
[33:22.22]This is fucking terrible.
[33:24.28]Oh shit.
[33:28.84]Oh god.
[33:29.42]This is just not fucking respectable.
[33:33.39]We're supposed to be respecting the dead.
[33:36.31]I'm not fucking swinging him around like a joke.
[33:39.10]Come here.
[33:39.44]I got you.
[33:40.90]I got you.
[33:41.32]We're gonna fucking respect you.
[33:43.84]Come over here.
[33:49.83]It's alright.
[33:51.43]Come with me.
[33:53.63]We're gonna take you and we're gonna fucking respect you, buddy.
[33:56.69]Hey, I'm still here.
[34:08.19]I need to grab him again.
[34:12.80]Let's go in here, let's just get rid of these guys.
[34:21.12]Let me fucking respect this guy for a second.
[34:25.06]Can I pull him over to me?
[34:27.89]No, all I can do is just swing him around.
[34:32.15]He's getting dangerously close to getting fucking hit by this guy.
[34:39.24]What are you thinking, dude?
[34:43.07]Why would you run?
[34:50.37]Oh, this is perfect.
[34:52.89]He was just swinging at nothing, too.
[34:54.53]What a dipshit.
[34:58.88]And that's what you get.
[35:04.96]I might have to do that again and just see if I can get a guy killed that way.
[35:09.56]Yeah, I mean, honestly, we have to do that again.
[35:13.62]I'm just gonna swing him and just see what happens.
[35:17.22]I'm gonna hide.
[35:17.84]We're just gonna pull him.
[35:18.62]Okay, he's spinning now.
[35:25.70]This guy eventually is gonna move.
[35:26.90]Somebody has to die from this.
[35:30.22]He's close.
[35:30.62]It's gonna happen.
[35:34.41]Okay, got him.
[35:35.85]They don't know it's me, right?
[35:37.33]They have no idea.
[35:40.03]Do they have any idea?
[35:40.77]I think that guy knows.
[35:49.01]Oh shit, he does know.
[35:49.99]How the fuck would you know?
[35:52.94]How would you ever fucking know that?
[35:56.60]Well, fine.
[35:57.10]You die.
[35:57.60]This guy's practicing.
[36:03.66]I fucking love this game.
[36:09.40]Why would you just go back to practicing?
[36:11.00]That's what I don't understand.
[36:18.49]Local streamer weaponizes corpse.
[36:22.49]I mean, that's kinda what's happening.
[36:28.12]Can I just take him with me?
[36:30.80]I have to be able to take him with me wherever I go, right?
[36:32.82]I mean, that would be so...
[36:37.89]Did this guy just split into two people?
[36:39.51]What the fuck was that?
[36:40.37]I disarmed him.
[36:46.18]That's cool.
[36:49.94]As this guy just swings around.
[36:51.30]Alright, let's see.
[36:56.31]I want to tetherball this guy.
[36:57.35]I have like one chance here.
[36:58.31]Come here.
[37:01.57]Come on.
[37:03.21]You gotta be moving, dude.
[37:05.41]Never mind.
[37:15.50]Holy shit, I just destroyed that guy.
[37:20.25]Another guy!
[37:20.97]Come on!
[37:21.53]What is with this shit?
[37:33.44]He didn't... He didn't even see him.
[37:37.84]It was fucking perfect.
[37:41.48]Prepare!
[37:42.30]Oh!
[37:44.10]Whoops!
[37:45.69]Alright, we're going this way.
[37:48.10]I have to be able to take him with us.
[37:51.32]We have to see how far we can get this guy, right?
[37:57.28]I think we can bring him all the way across.
[37:59.60]It's possible, isn't it?
[38:02.90]Okay, I gotta be looking at him.
[38:04.79]Holy shit.
[38:07.35]I have to have my eyes on him the whole time.
[38:11.50]Come here.
[38:12.56]Come here.
[38:12.94]Come here.
[38:14.16]Stop fucking moving.
[38:15.22]Stop!
[38:16.38]Stop it.
[38:16.94]Come here.
[38:17.64]Let me just please pick you up.
[38:23.23]Get him.
[38:24.09]Oh my god.
[38:24.81]Please pick him up.
[38:27.07]Stop fucking moving around.
[38:29.57]Got it.
[38:29.93]Okay.
[38:31.31]So I gotta go up there.
[38:34.15]I have to like just be looking at him the whole time.
[38:38.86]How do I get up there?
[38:39.72]Are we gonna go that way?
[38:45.48]As long as I have my eyes on him, he's gonna come with me.
[38:49.88]Okay, this just looks like a really shitty marionette.
[38:54.98]Okay, I don't think... You can't take him.
[38:56.88]Whatever.
[38:59.38]Just cut him down.
[39:03.64]Where did he go?
[39:05.04]There he is.
[39:06.00]And now we can take him.
[39:11.55]That's like when, you know Kermit the Frog, when he throws his hands in the air and he goes like, whoa!
[39:16.11]That's just happening to this guy.
[39:29.25]What is he doing?
[39:36.48]Okay, I think that's the item I need.
[39:38.99]Yeah.
[39:41.13]A black orb.
[39:44.35]Alright.
[39:48.14]Updated.
[39:48.90]Find an errant and discover his plans.
[39:51.14]So that orb now goes on those doors.
[39:53.64]I think I can level up, though.
[39:59.33]What to do?
[40:00.05]What to do, really?
[40:01.77]I mean, we have to go down here.
[40:03.15]We have to.
[40:04.97]We have to shrink people.
[40:06.33]Like, that's so stupid.
[40:08.58]Am I going to be the complete might and magic jokey LOL streamer if I'm not going to have the shrinking solution?
[40:18.43]I'm already one-click manning people.
[40:20.97]We have to get weakened.
[40:22.25]We have to shrink people and make them slip and slide.
[40:27.55]I could do another point of strength, but we have to get to slip and slide, right?
[40:34.89]That's 10 skill points.
[40:35.93]It's going to take a long time.
[40:40.34]I'm going for it.
[40:40.84]We have to.
[40:41.36]I have to do that.
[40:42.52]I have to do this.
[40:47.76]We have to shrink people.
[40:49.92]I'm going to make a cyclops and shrink him and then kick him off a cliff.
[40:52.76]That's a future joke.
[40:54.14]Just fucking making that clear on you guys.
[40:59.40]And it better be fucking something you laugh at.
[41:00.96]Otherwise, whoa, we're going to have a problem.
[41:06.57]Alright, so I got the orb.
[41:11.64]Let's just take Oogie Boogie.
[41:13.80]Send it back to the night before Christmas.
[41:17.84]The night... The night... No, the nightmare before Christmas.
[41:20.22]Not the night before Christmas.
[41:23.72]There is a door I can open with the magic orb.
[41:28.05]And a yoink-a-yoink.
[41:29.25]There it is.
[41:34.85]-2.
[41:35.69]Ah, come on.
[41:36.11]You can give me some credit there.
[41:38.25]It was at least a plus one reference.
[41:41.78]I think that was just a shortcut back to here.
[41:43.32]I think it was.
[41:44.97]Can we dump acid on people?
[41:46.01]God damn it.
[41:50.25]This is like fucked up.
[41:51.81]This guy's dropping like sandstorms.
[41:53.65]Oh, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[42:12.36]Tell me that didn't hit.
[42:14.06]Alright, we gotta think of a new solution.
[42:17.24]We gotta think of something new here.
[42:19.26]This is too much for me.
[42:26.53]I gotta dump them in the fucking Joker acid.
[42:35.44]We gotta get in there in one click, man.
[42:44.37]Jesus Christ.
[42:45.89]What's this thing?
[42:49.56]Whoa, that was... I'm going to give myself a little credit for that one.
[42:52.32]That was fucking sick.
[42:54.76]We're good.
[42:58.22]These things can't be dumped.
[43:01.42]Grotesque imagery.
[43:05.11]Something down there.
[43:05.75]No.
[43:06.03]That guy's still alive.
[43:06.93]That guy's still alive.
[43:08.87]Oh, my God.
[43:09.57]What do I do about this?
[43:11.99]Holy shit.
[43:12.55]What do I do?
[43:12.89]I got to...
[43:18.00]I didn't, I missed.
[43:18.76]I missed him.
[43:19.21]Hit him with the peanut butter.
[43:26.57]Can I, am I missing?
[43:28.95]Just fucking just hit him.
[43:31.53]I can't kill this guy.
[43:32.39]I can't put this guy out of his misery.
[43:34.73]How do I kill him?
[43:36.74]This is so, I need to mercy kill him.
[43:43.52]Trapdoor key.
[43:46.62]I have to bury this axe in this guy's head.
[43:53.52]I can't kill him.
[43:54.66]This is so horrible.
[44:04.11]Nothing I can do about it.
[44:07.49]I'm trying to respect you.
[44:09.45]What about your friend?
[44:10.13]No, you're the only one that's alive.
[44:12.17]And there's a trapdoor key.
[44:13.13]Use it.
[44:17.41]Wait a minute.
[44:20.89]He's just apparently suffering forever, unfortunately.
[44:23.21]I tried.
[44:23.57]I can go down there, but... Ooh, there's some prisoners here.
[44:28.33]Got trapdoors everywhere.
[44:30.99]Just a couple of humans in here.
[44:35.19]These guys are going to turn into zombies or something, right?
[44:36.97]Let's go investigate.
[44:43.83]Really?
[44:45.91]Okay.
[44:47.84]They're all just like a default villager.
[44:49.44]Do they still slip like any other person would?
[44:56.31]Yes, they do.
[44:57.29]I think that killed him.
[45:03.07]No, it didn't.
[45:04.95]Oh, whatever.
[45:05.47]Just burn the bodies.
[45:17.09]Okie dokie.
[45:17.73]Turn this off.
[45:19.55]What's in here?
[45:20.25]Some antidotes.
[45:21.43]Good.
[45:21.91]Health potions.
[45:24.33]I'm okay with this.
[45:26.15]Although I do have sanctuary now.
[45:29.84]Where is it?
[45:31.18]I should use this, right?
[45:34.90]Create a magic shield that will protect you from physical attacks and magic projectiles for a short period.
[45:38.56]So that's just like a power shield.
[45:40.72]That's cool.
[45:41.26]Okay.
[45:43.97]I can open this door.
[45:47.20]Burn the bodies.
[45:47.86]Yeah, that's what you do.
[45:50.96]If you don't burn the bodies, then what?
[45:53.78]Shadowsteel daggers.
[45:54.80]I already fucking have this crap.
[45:58.58]Is this a fucking dentist instrument?
[46:00.58]Don't need that.
[46:03.33]Can't break anything.
[46:04.21]I already got what I needed from here.
[46:10.27]I'm not going to try and attempt to make a joke with that shit anymore.
[46:14.25]These guys are done, done, donezo, donezo, donezo.
[46:16.97]Go, go, go.
[46:17.69]Gonzo, gonzo.
[46:19.55]Gonzo, donezo, gonzo.
[46:23.08]Smash that guy in the mouth.
[46:24.64]Nothing here.
[46:27.76]Wait a... Wait a minute.
[46:30.56]Wait a second.
[46:32.42]Secret!
[46:33.52]Secret little stash of baked bread.
[46:37.70]And
[46:43.42]That's it?
[46:44.02]Cool.
[46:46.36]This guy's gonna be out, right?
[46:48.28]No.
[46:52.32]That guy may have just been sleepy.
[46:53.75]He might not have been a zombie, but I can't take any chances.
[46:58.39]Any shit up here?
[47:00.89]I don't think so.
[47:01.53]Alright, let's keep going.
[47:05.61]We can go in the trap doors.
[47:07.49]Which, I might as well.
[47:09.61]GRAB THE DOOR!
[47:17.00]It's so dark I can't even... Fucking god damn it, man.
[47:29.52]Nothing's even in here that I need.
[47:30.58]Just fucking go in and grab the ladder.
[47:32.48]You just fall down.
[47:34.78]You don't just jump down here.
[47:36.93]Turn this on.
[47:41.53]Grab the door.
[47:44.09]Grab the door.
[47:48.25]Nice and dark in here.
[47:49.19]There's gonna be fucking alien monsters in the water.
[47:52.85]Burn the bodies.
[47:53.45]Christ.
[48:04.06]I can't pull this.
[48:04.78]I don't have a key.
[48:07.84]Can I pull that with telekinesis?
[48:11.92]Apparently it's too far away, whatever it is, so no.
[48:13.65]Nope.
[48:17.57]Burn the bodies in the water.
[48:18.99]Yes, that's a very smart idea.
[48:21.21]I'm glad I thought of it.
[48:22.23]That's just another exit.
[48:25.27]Let's see what's over here.
[48:30.02]Hold the shield up just in case we get Dark Souls'd.
[48:33.82]And we're just going to go up this way.
[48:41.19]Hello?
[48:44.05]This is just here.
[48:45.01]There's three of them, right?
[48:46.27]What the fuck was even down there?
[48:49.55]One, two, three.
[48:50.81]Well, I have the orb.
[48:51.57]Let's just get out of this.
[48:55.65]Just so this wasn't a shortcut.
[48:57.04]Or was there another ladder I could have used there?
[48:58.58]I don't know.
[49:03.36]Stream GTA 1 or 2?
[49:05.18]I think 2 is more interesting to me.
[49:11.98]2 has the loonies, which is the best... The best faction of any video game.
[49:18.69]They're insane.
[49:20.23]They say, whoop, whoop, the loonies.
[49:25.81]Those of you that play GTA 2, you will know my references.
[49:30.02]Whoop, whoop, the loonies.
[49:36.02]What a fucking great game.
[49:37.92]GTA 2 is just...
[49:40.45]I don't know.
[49:41.63]Going back to GTA, the old top-down ones might be hard for people to watch just because it's very, very old.
[49:49.49]And that perspective to a lot of people might not be something that people want to see.
[49:53.36]It might be like headache-inducing at this point.
[49:55.92]I don't know.
[49:56.96]I haven't tried it in a long time.
[49:58.64]I would give it a shot, though.
[50:00.82]Hey, Kane.
[50:02.18]Kane the Insane.
[50:03.20]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[50:04.22]I won.
[50:04.66]I won.
[50:04.94]I get 10 bucks.
[50:06.86]Well, I got 10 bucks, so I won.
[50:10.37]But thank you for the $10.
[50:12.69]Much appreciated.
[50:15.99]That is $10 that I will spend.
[50:18.16]I will make sure to spend on things that you approve of.
[50:25.84]So, burritos and...
[50:30.81]Why was I going to just say this?
[50:33.03]I don't know.
[50:34.31]I'm just fucked up.
[50:37.21]I'm not like one of those fucked up streamers.
[50:39.65]To the cells.
[50:41.53]Library and training area.
[50:42.77]Let's just... I need to put that orb in something.
[50:47.60]Every time the game loads, I think it's crashing.
[50:50.96]That would be scary.
[50:52.20]Alright, what about... Fuck me.
[50:56.62]Fuck me.
[51:01.88]Wasn't there one at the very beginning that I could go into?
[51:03.70]Fucked up stream.
[51:10.28]I swear there was one at the very beginning that I said, wow, I should come back here and do that.
[51:20.47]Am I out of my mind?
[51:22.23]Or was there one like over here?
[51:27.47]This game is boring.
[51:30.53]No, not true.
[51:31.53]We're just at a kind of... We're at a kind of a slow, boring part of the game.
[51:35.96]Which is this part.
[51:38.80]Alright, well, this opened here.
[51:41.94]What the fuck was in here?
[51:43.90]Nothing.
[51:47.98]Just some more concrete.
[51:49.48]And beds.
[51:51.76]And scrolls that I don't want to pick up.
[51:54.37]and one health potion sure I'll take the one health potion that works for me this game isn't boring I'm boring what did you what I'm boring how dare you speak those words why won't this open alright I can't put the skull in the skull something I haven't figured out something I haven't done
[52:22.40]streamer rages find errands here I have this fucking dumb skull I guess because there's like a series of doors I can use it on over here it's some free shit okay nothing else holy Psalms this just leads to nothing come on
[52:51.41]Come on.
[52:51.91]One of these has to be the secret entrance.
[52:54.12]One of you has to be correct.
[52:57.14]Ah, shit.
[52:59.84]Do I have to go all the way back to where I was?
[53:01.58]Can I grab this?
[53:07.73]Grab this shit.
[53:08.45]I can grab that, right?
[53:10.25]No.
[53:14.27]Yeah, we just had like a slow portion of the game.
[53:17.09]Because it's one of those games where you have to run around in circles sometimes and look for the one thing you didn't do.
[53:26.93]So, sorry about this part of the game.
[53:29.85]Go back to the butcher shithole.
[53:33.55]Like, you be talking about where the guy was, like, roped up.
[53:35.59]Oh, this is to the cells.
[53:39.65]Because I was down there already.
[53:45.16]Uh, well, I guess we're just going to track back around.
[53:47.44]I, I, I, I, I, I.
[53:56.90]Aye, aye, Captain.
[54:00.74]Where's, like, the secret fucking door that I have to go in?
[54:05.50]This just brings me back up again.
[54:08.28]Well... Mm-hmm.
[54:12.83]Everybody just go down there.
[54:13.83]Can I sneak down there?
[54:16.31]Can I do the... Like, I already said the rush hour two thing, right?
[54:19.37]I'm not gonna fucking die if I go down there.
[54:23.31]Ugh.
[54:23.51]Ugh.
[54:27.36]Just jump?
[54:29.42]No way.
[54:29.96]I'm not gonna jump that.
[54:31.44]I will never make that.
[54:34.22]I missed a door in the bottom of the library.
[54:36.96]Well.
[54:38.88]There's that thing.
[54:41.22]Uh.
[54:42.12]I might just like go back to where I was.
[54:44.80]Where was I?
[54:45.74]1156.
[54:46.88]Where was this?
[54:49.32]Was this like the sewer?
[54:51.26]I don't fucking remember.
[54:52.31]What time is it right now? 57.
[55:00.52]Just save, scum it.
[55:04.70]I really don't like backtracking around like this.
[55:07.60]Or like... I don't think I even need to backtrack.
[55:11.75]But... What's that old term?
[55:13.83]Directions unclear.
[55:16.13]Got lost in a video game walking in circles for 10 minutes.
[55:21.15]Stream Mad Max.
[55:24.27]Um... I mean... Wasn't that the new one that just came out?
[55:27.82]Is that what you're talking about?
[55:30.48]Press G to show the guide.
[55:37.54]Well, I'm gonna go back down.
[55:45.99]Something I have a problem with in games, like just me personally.
[55:49.45]is once I start to go in circles and backtrack I forget everything and like everything becomes the same hallway so then you end up like going around in circles again and getting lost again and then everything is just blended together and there's no escaping ever so this is like the beginning here this is where this is the beginning I want to make sure I didn't fucking miss another one of those doors
[56:20.79]Nothing on this side.
[56:22.23]I'm just being thorough about this.
[56:26.75]And nothing on this side.
[56:28.07]Okay.
[56:30.98]That's what it's like to take... Ah!
[56:32.88]Here we go.
[56:35.18]Alright.
[56:35.68]Let this be the right way, please.
[56:37.62]It's an elevator.
[56:40.44]So... Come on.
[56:42.59]I didn't activate the fucking Dark Souls secret switch thing.
[56:48.19]I have to activate this elevator somewhere?
[56:50.13]Oh, fucking heebie-jeebies.
[56:51.65]Give me a break.
[56:53.55]Oh, thank God.
[57:03.03]Just rope-bow?
[57:05.85]No rope-bow.
[57:07.73]Alright, well, here's the shortcut.
[57:10.87]To wherever the fuck this is right now.
[57:13.75]Oh, this is downstairs.
[57:14.41]Okay, I think this is where I need to be.
[57:16.03]Figured it out.
[57:19.67]So you see what I mean?
[57:20.33]Like, that, like... That was just, like, a fucking roll the dice to, like, run around in circles and find the door.
[57:28.40]Um... Here we go.
[57:33.68]Is this way?
[57:34.38]Oh, there's a million ways to go.
[57:36.63]We're gonna try to remember.
[57:37.49]We're gonna go right first.
[57:38.71]We're gonna come back out here.
[57:43.53]What are these bedrooms?
[57:44.67]A lot of fucking necromancers live here.
[57:47.17]Since when do necromancers share beds and shit?
[57:50.19]What is this?
[57:50.63]I don't want to sleep on this bed.
[57:55.31]Look at this.
[57:55.69]Look at how close this bed is to your face.
[57:57.67]Your head's right here.
[58:00.27]Necromancers bunk up in bunk beds?
[58:05.33]Eight in one room.
[58:07.73]No, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[58:09.91]Fucking, like...
[58:13.03]8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 in one room.
[58:19.22]When I was in college, I shared... I shared a suite.
[58:23.52]A dorm.
[58:23.96]It was eight people in my suite.
[58:25.96]We all had separate fucking rooms.
[58:32.07]Like I can't count.
[58:34.01]You like that one?
[58:34.53]Alright.
[58:39.93]Get fucking disrespected, you dead motherfucker.
[58:42.49]Alright, oil jars.
[58:44.73]This guy, poor guy.
[58:49.57]You go over there with like your friend.
[58:57.50]Gotta go up the stairs.
[59:00.62]Low IQ streamer can't time.
[59:02.14]I was just kidding.
[59:03.32]I'm just kidding.
[59:06.98]I'm just being thorough.
[59:10.79]Because I don't want to miss anything.
[59:13.10]Because you know I will.
[59:14.32]And there'll be one door.
[59:15.70]Like this door right here.
[59:17.90]To more like the fucking stinky sleep quarters where the necromancers sleep.
[59:20.92]And there's like a key that's going to be in one of these.
[59:24.88]There's one specific key I had to pick up that was in somebody's bed.
[59:27.61]Oh, dude.
[59:31.55]Somebody had a fucking party here last night.
[59:33.33]This dorm room is fucking nuts.
[59:36.62]Oh, somebody puked.
[59:37.41]Somebody puked in the corner.
[59:38.47]They thought they made it to the bathroom.
[59:39.91]Oh, man, that definitely was fucking Frank.
[59:42.79]He gets, like, shit-faced.
[59:45.55]Oh, look, somebody puked over here, too.
[59:46.87]What a fucking... What a fucking... Oh, yeah, good vocabulary.
[59:52.52]Oh, what's under here?
[59:54.46]Excuse me.
[59:55.64]It's Gary's diary.
[59:57.80]What's it say?
[59:59.16]Let's read it.
[60:06.02]Diary sucks.
[60:10.38]Your diary's terrible, dude.
[60:15.85]Oh, and whoa, what happened over here?
[60:17.25]Oh, Mike got so drunk.
[60:20.97]Somebody cut him in half and, like, stapled him to the fucking wall, dude.
[60:24.78]Bro, drink!
[60:25.76]Drink, bro!
[60:26.84]Drink, dude!
[60:27.96]You serious?
[60:36.43]What was I doing?
[60:37.57]I was going over here?
[60:45.33]What frat are you?
[60:46.17]No, this is where I came.
[60:52.68]Local funny man.
[60:54.58]Not really.
[60:57.54]What happened over here?
[60:58.80]Oh, whoa!
[61:00.40]Dude, I told you!
[61:02.40]Dude, Steve, man, I told you not to fucking mix alcohol and battery acid!
[61:07.76]I told you it makes your fucking skin melt off!
[61:12.45]Alright, okay, come on, come on, Pledge!
[61:15.05]Get on there and drink!
[61:16.99]Drink these bottles of fucking rum!
[61:19.79]Yeah!
[61:22.55]Come on, man, just fucking drink it up!
[61:28.95]I missed every one!
[61:34.54]I give up on that one.
[61:35.34]Let's just go through the door.
[61:36.16]He's not okay, it seems.
[61:42.96]What a fucked up frat house.
[61:44.24]Everyone's being murdered.
[61:51.88]Frat boy.
[61:53.26]No, I was not in a fraternity.
[61:55.10]I was not.
[61:57.56]Please, give me an opening to this.
[62:00.32]Don't I have a demon form?
[62:03.99]Can I not go in here?
[62:07.05]Can this not be opened?
[62:08.09]Shit.
[62:12.93]What does that say?
[62:13.69]I'm not missing something, right?
[62:24.54]Just no clip it.
[62:25.38]I don't know, man.
[62:27.92]Why would it load this whole area if this door can't even be opened?
[62:35.63]Demon lock?
[62:37.91]Just no clip.
[62:38.57]I might have to.
[62:39.67]We might be no clippings for that.
[62:41.43]Where is this?
[62:44.18]Arantear's Room, Spider's Lair.
[62:45.80]This place is insane!
[62:47.22]This place is so big!
[62:49.00]Hey!
[62:51.72]What the hell happened here?
[62:52.50]Hey, let's go, pledges!
[62:57.18]Make your way down there!
[62:59.61]And by the way, you better have chugged that beer!
[63:05.85]Hey, fucking Danny, I'm handling the fucking pledges tonight.
[63:10.06]Not you, hey.
[63:11.40]Hey, the fire on the ass doesn't start until 7 o'clock.
[63:13.86]Get the fuck out of here.
[63:18.24]Now drink, bro.
[63:22.16]I can't turn this into this.
[63:23.34]I can't.
[63:24.58]I have my pledges here.
[63:25.70]No, this is not what I want.
[63:30.38]We're gonna make a fucking shot, luge.
[63:33.94]Alright dude, you ready to take like a shot off the ice luge?
[63:38.32]Easy, don't get too drunk buddy!
[63:50.98]You thought this was a fucking frat house!
[63:52.52]This is my fucked up torture chamber!
[63:58.51]Why are there people even in here now?
[63:59.71]I don't understand.
[64:00.29]There weren't people in here before.
[64:04.83]Great joke.
[64:10.93]Come here.
[64:18.16]Why is the shield not on?
[64:19.72]Alright, like honest to god, why the fuck are there a hundred people in here right now?
[64:29.66]This was completely and totally empty when I came in here last.
[64:38.71]Is that it?
[64:40.35]Did some door open somewhere?
[64:50.69]Why is there like just a giant party in here right now?
[64:52.57]I love how these guys are harder to kill than the actual enemies.
[65:04.01]Supposed to come back this way later.
[65:08.83]I'm just standing in this fire.
[65:11.05]No, that was oil on the ground.
[65:15.84]Okay.
[65:17.82]So, um... Shit.
[65:26.24]So I'm not supposed to be back here?
[65:30.58]Drink, bro!
[65:36.39]Dude, you gotta drink every time.
[65:38.96]Jerma goes the wrong way.
[65:44.06]What are the redeeming qualities of this game?
[65:46.46]Well, it is... It looks awful.
[65:50.82]It's definitely not... Okay, this area is kind of lame, I will say.
[65:54.59]It's kind of lame.
[65:56.15]It's a huge area with just a million places to go, and it's...
[66:01.45]It's a 2006 game.
[66:02.99]No.
[66:04.33]The game up until this point has been very, very action-packed and fun.
[66:13.62]Okay, let's jump down here.
[66:17.80]No, that's where I already was.
[66:19.97]I don't need to go down there.
[66:21.71]That's where I was before, and I can't get through that door because it just leads me to nothing.
[66:26.67]So what in the fucking seven hells am I supposed to do?
[66:33.01]You know what I mean?
[66:33.51]Like, what in the seven hells am I supposed to do?
[66:37.73]Back down to the library and, like, good luck trying to get me to fucking find the library.
[66:41.92]Drink, dude!
[66:48.64]Good luck trying to get me to fucking find the library again.
[66:51.94]To the cells.
[66:59.31]I love how fucking bad that joke really is.
[67:02.91]It's fucking terrible.
[67:04.35]But you know that I'm going to keep using it.
[67:06.81]You better believe I'm going to keep using it.
[67:08.73]That's not going to stop for like an hour.
[67:14.16]Hey, the ass cream man.
[67:15.88]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[67:18.24]Glad I caught the Tuesday night frat stream.
[67:22.34]Thanks, dude.

[67:55.54]You know what I mean?
[67:56.10]Like... We're just gonna... I'm gonna find the library and I'm gonna turn this off.
[67:59.88]Okay?
[68:01.19]I just need to get to the seat through the fucking walls and see where the library even was.
[68:04.83]Library's not down there.
[68:05.79]Like, I know no one's gonna be happy about this.
[68:12.39]But, what's the alternative?
[68:14.40]You want me to walk around in circles at a fucking frat party?
[68:16.56]Not gonna happen.
[68:18.44]Where's the library?
[68:22.30]No, it's not over there.

[68:59.61]I can't even find it with cheats.
[69:04.85]Is it down there?
[69:05.73]I can't even cheat in this game.
[69:12.19]I forget where the... I forget... I forget where the loading screen... Is it down here?
[69:19.09]Is this where the loading screen is for the library?
[69:21.59]Yes, I think it is, right?
[69:23.61]Is this the loading screen for the library?
[69:24.83]Let's just check.
[69:26.89]No, this is not the loading screen for the library.
[69:30.23]That's a loading screen for the... What happened to me?
[69:34.84]I fell to my death.
[69:46.43]Okay, hold on.
[69:47.87]How did that happen?
[69:52.60]Alright, so.
[69:54.10]This is going to be Twitch plays Might and Magic.
[69:57.96]From here, I don't remember where it is.
[70:00.52]I stand in this hallway.
[70:04.57]Which way am I going?
[70:05.27]Am I turning my body left or right?
[70:06.71]Fucking drink, bro.
[70:16.73]I just don't know.
[70:18.64]Right.
[70:18.98]Okay, right.
[70:22.06]You guys are saying fucking left and shit.
[70:28.43]Down here?
[70:33.37]North.
[70:35.65]Forward.
[70:36.87]Twitch doesn't... Twitch chat doesn't know either.
[70:38.83]What the fuck?
[70:39.63]I'm not dying.
[70:45.37]I have no clip enabled.
[70:46.61]How is that me dying?
[70:57.35]Down here?
[71:03.30]Just go back to the cell.
[71:07.86]Talk about like, oh my fucking god, it's noclip.
[71:10.56]Game, it's noclip.
[71:12.62]It's noclip.
[71:13.47]Please, let me just fucking get there.
[71:15.03]There we go.
[71:23.99]This is it, right?
[71:26.38]Then from here,
[71:29.30]Where is it from here?
[71:35.43]Which way is it from here?
[71:36.19]I don't remember.
[71:38.33]Right.
[71:41.57]Let's go to the left.
[71:47.45]I just saved in a wall.
[71:48.36]Fuck.
[71:49.84]The room on the corner.
[71:51.92]Found it.
[71:52.52]Okay.
[71:54.56]Listen.
[71:54.84]Everybody calm down.
[71:56.90]We're done?
[71:58.04]We're good?
[72:01.76]This is so infuriating to watch.
[72:04.21]Well, so is running around in circles finding the fucking spot to go in this game.
[72:08.59]This is not the right way.
[72:18.79]What do you mean this is not the right way?
[72:19.83]This is where the library and shit is, right?
[72:23.41]Yeah, this is where it was before.
[72:30.57]Okay.
[72:32.27]Just pretend like you didn't see any of that shit.
[72:35.29]Pretend like this is brand new.
[72:36.75]Like, we just got back here.
[72:38.01]No big deal.
[72:39.23]Just checking for doors.
[72:42.57]Chug it.
[72:44.35]I don't need to chug it.
[72:45.05]I didn't get lost.
[72:45.99]Okay.
[72:52.08]I'm gonna just drop down here.
[72:54.00]Did I just break my sword?
[73:00.87]We're looking for doors to go in that we couldn't go in before I'm just walking in circles in the library Not a big deal 1985 viewers My birthday just watching me fucking walk around in circles I don't want to miss any rooms
[73:27.47]We're talking high quality Dark Messiah here.
[73:30.95]I don't think there's anything else, so we're just going to keep going down.
[73:43.60]Out of the way, four eyes.
[73:45.90]Drink.
[73:46.40]No, I don't need to drink.
[73:47.90]Fine.
[73:53.49]I took in like a eyedrop worth of alcohol.
[73:56.73]So there you go.
[73:57.99]Alright, what about here?
[73:58.61]Anything in here?
[74:04.73]This looks like... I don't think I've been this way.
[74:07.61]This random fucking hallway.
[74:08.76]I don't remember the mummies.
[74:12.06]No, okay.
[74:12.48]I remember this.
[74:13.34]Yep.
[74:14.34]So there's another way to go.
[74:18.36]Let's just check in here one more time.
[74:23.47]Oh my god.
[74:24.65]Everything is just...
[74:27.98]I remember this.
[74:28.76]There's nothing in here.
[74:31.37]Just go.
[74:31.79]Okay, I can go left or right.
[74:37.93]I don't think there's anything in here.
[74:42.41]No, just a bunch of books.
[74:45.93]I do hear something, though.
[74:49.23]I'm seeing shit.
[74:52.83]Which dark hallway is the right hallway?
[74:55.97]I don't know.
[75:00.07]Should I make another frat joke?
[75:06.07]No.
[75:08.01]You just burn on your own friend's body.
[75:16.62]These guys summon skeletons.
[75:18.70]That's what that is.
[75:22.54]Armor?
[75:23.34]Plate armor?
[75:23.92]Alright, I haven't been down here.
[75:27.29]Quick, make a fart joke.
[75:32.69]I don't think I've been up here.
[75:34.60]Have I?
[75:36.10]Guys.
[75:39.42]Go back to the portal.
[75:41.86]Wait, go all the way back up to like the fucking Kool-Aid portal?
[75:46.48]But I was just here.
[75:47.32]I just... I'm so lost.
[76:00.85]What the fuck am I?
[76:05.61]Hold on, wait, are they about to throw her in there?
[76:07.15]She's alive.
[76:07.71]Help me!
[76:10.38]I hear human voices!
[76:14.92]Why don't you help me?
[76:15.56]How am I going to get up there that fast?
[76:16.86]Leanna, no!
[76:23.15]Whoa!
[76:23.91]Wait, that just... There's a giant spider down there.
[76:31.89]Holy shit.
[76:32.73]Alright, game just got way more interesting.
[76:43.00]Chop off his fucking head.
[76:44.24]Is she dead?
[76:50.60]Did I just lose her?
[76:51.56]Does that change the ending of the game that I didn't meet the spider fast enough?
[76:57.10]Asha's gift, the theory of magic.
[76:58.86]Get that out of here.
[76:59.54]We don't study in this school.
[77:02.40]Oh, dude.
[77:03.00]This guy right here is fucking doing homework.
[77:06.40]Studying books and shit.
[77:08.06]Nah, I'll take that from him.
[77:12.39]This is what we think about fucking boys that want to study.
[77:18.37]Get that shit out of here, you fucking dork.
[77:25.20]To the prayer room.
[77:28.68]More jokes.
[77:29.20]Alright, well, let's not go to the... I'm going to get lost again.
[77:35.89]Guaranteed.
[77:41.45]Get stunned.
[77:42.39]Well, you are stunned already.
[77:43.33]That's fine.
[77:45.89]And then bury this into his chest.
[77:49.94]Am I okay?
[77:50.44]Yeah, I'm fine.
[77:51.10]Never been better.
[77:54.54]Never been better.
[77:56.52]Just having a little bit of fun.
[77:59.85]Nothing up there.
[78:00.27]This guy got a longsword?
[78:14.40]I don't know who's talking but... There's an NPC in here talking.
[78:31.89]I'm just like interrupting the concert.
[78:38.36]Nice dodge.
[78:39.92]What the fuck?
[78:41.04]You superhuman psychopath.
[78:51.75]Holy shit, that's a lot of people.
[78:54.09]Oh god.
[78:56.01]Oh, I'm frozen.
[78:57.23]Oh, how do I get out of this?
[79:06.15]Come on.
[79:10.95]Get down there!
[79:15.43]Holy shit, dude.
[79:20.27]That's so many people.
[79:21.27]I'm gonna take them out one by one.
[79:37.73]We can block these projectiles right through the chest.
[79:43.21]Get the fuck out of here.
[79:45.23]Press the orc button?
[79:50.23]Not yet.
[79:51.19]No orc button yet.
[79:52.07]I kind of want to just get the fuck out of this level.
[79:57.73]I don't like this level very much.
[79:59.19]I don't know where this brings me, but it brings me somewhere.
[80:08.18]Yump.
[80:12.08]This is his chamber in here.
[80:13.69]I almost just fucking died.
[80:15.09]Oh my fucking god.
[80:20.97]Will you stay up?
[80:23.25]Wedge a rock in there, you fucking idiot.
[80:30.90]Let's go kill this guy.
[80:34.27]That guy's dead?
[80:36.91]I wish I could pick up the brick
[81:02.08]Hey, well, here's a little shortcut, it seems.
[81:08.08]Or is this just his chamber?
[81:11.40]I'm a master of this guy.
[81:12.36]No, we're going down again.
[81:13.66]I really hope this is the guy's chamber here.
[81:23.35]This, that goes up.
[81:25.19]Where the hell are we?
[81:25.73]Mm-hmm.
[81:33.50]Oh, she's down there.
[81:34.32]Portal.
[81:36.24]I don't care.
[81:36.92]Search his room.
[81:38.06]Uh, his journal's right in front of us.
[81:39.76]So he's opening a fucking scary portal.
[81:41.52]Got it.
[82:01.89]Nice abstract art.
[82:03.80]Okay, so objective done.
[82:05.64]Escape through the portal.
[82:09.50]Should I save the girl?
[82:13.40]You think I should rescue the girl?
[82:14.52]Or is that too much time?
[82:17.98]Should I jump down there?
[82:20.68]Spider pit.
[82:21.34]I mean... Let's save her.
[82:28.59]I thought that may have happened.
[82:32.77]Let's go save her.
[82:34.37]She's an important fucking main character.
[82:38.92]Can't have her just die.
[82:40.08]And there's like a big spider boss down here, so might as well... Might as well check.
[82:48.42]We might have to do it anyways.
[82:52.77]Down to the pit.
[82:56.53]Creepy spiders.
[83:01.17]Aren't I the bad guy?
[83:03.39]Actually, yeah, I am.
[83:06.11]That never stopped me before, being bad.
[83:12.22]The worst part about this is actually having to fight spiders.
[83:15.34]But I am one hitman on these guys, I think.
[83:17.04]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[83:19.04]Just run.
[83:21.44]Don't fight anyone.
[83:22.90]Just get to the cutscene where you pull her out of the web and then fight the boss.
[83:27.65]Where are you?
[83:29.79]Where is she?
[83:31.68]Whoa!
[83:32.18]Uh... Don't let them steal my soul!
[83:37.68]Don't let them steal my soul.
[83:43.00]Alright, should I... Okay, I'm gonna need an equalizer here.
[83:47.56]I'm gonna need an equalizer.
[83:53.66]Here we go.
[83:58.75]I did this for a reason.
[83:59.93]Get her!
[84:04.32]He instantly killed it.
[84:07.32]He instantly fucking killed the spider.
[84:09.70]That was it?
[84:10.46]Whoa, there's another one.
[84:11.54]There's more than one.
[84:14.70]Wait, she just fell and died.
[84:16.14]What happened?
[84:19.02]Oh, fuck.
[84:21.46]Oh, my God.
[84:24.79]Well, that was a big reveal that we just... Oh, he's gonna... Hold on a minute.
[84:27.87]You're my friend.
[84:29.89]Just... Okay, you can scream in my face.
[84:31.57]That's fine.
[84:32.05]Oh.
[84:38.64]Oh, I've ruined the big fucking surprise.
[84:42.64]She fell down and died.
[84:43.79]Here we go.
[84:48.01]Bring it up.
[84:49.33]I know, I've killed spiders before.
[84:50.63]You hit them right in the egg sack.
[84:51.63]I'm gonna hit them right in the egg sack.
[85:06.42]I'll be good.
[85:16.62]Oh, right in the fucking head.
[85:18.04]Cut the fucking legs off.
[85:26.61]Doing alright?
[85:27.15]There's just a thousand spiders that I gotta get them to crush themselves.
[85:37.09]Come here, let me see your face.
[85:42.43]Ow.
[85:44.41]Monster Hunter.
[85:48.44]Kind of is like Monster Hunter, isn't it?
[85:51.01]Hopefully it doesn't take as long as Monster Hunter.
[86:03.48]I'm not hitting her in the egg sack.
[86:04.44]That's the problem.
[86:05.76]Alright, she's dead.
[86:07.10]Here comes the other one.
[86:07.72]Where's the other one?
[86:14.91]Wait.
[86:16.07]Hold on a second.
[86:17.05]What happened the last time?
[86:22.74]Was... Did it, like, respawn the boss because I didn't kill it?
[86:28.28]I have no idea.
[86:31.91]There's only one.
[86:35.77]So where did she... Where's... Where's the girl?
[86:38.17]Is the girl dead?
[86:40.74]There she is.
[86:41.16]Get this web off me.
[86:44.54]Whoa, wait, I thought I was
[87:14.17]Okay.
[87:15.49]Well, I want to see what the hell that was.
[87:17.33]Let's get her out.
[87:17.83]So you can do either or.
[87:21.91]Okay.
[87:22.01]Okay.
[87:40.13]You know, I'm going to keep her alive because I don't know how to get out.
[87:42.65]And I'm going to use her as my compass.
[87:47.59]You won't use me anymore, wench.
[87:50.24]You won't use me anymore, wench.
[88:00.02]I can't tell if she's running from me.
[88:01.20]Have you seen me like this before?
[88:03.58]Have you seen me like this?
[88:05.20]Yes, I'm a fucking monster.
[88:20.31]I still need her.
[88:20.83]I need her to let me out.
[88:25.67]It's the... This is the real... Okay.
[88:28.13]Honest to God, I did that to her.
[88:30.61]Already.
[88:31.01]I kicked her and she went that far.
[88:35.01]No, kill her.
[88:36.43]Leave her.
[88:36.91]No, I don't know how to leave.
[88:40.28]I'm so lost in this game, I need this NPC to show me where to go so I can fucking play the game.
[88:47.50]Evil frat boy.
[88:48.48]No, I'm not an evil frat boy anymore.
[88:50.12]I just rescued the lady that was stuck in the web.
[88:53.25]Because we're saving it here.
[88:55.63]And if there were spikes there, I would have just kicked her in.
[88:58.28]And you know that was going to happen.
[89:13.82]Like the last second just kick elevator No, I gotta stop it stop it This is so loud I can't even hear what she's saying
[89:36.15]believe you're one of those she wants to own you she pours poison in your ears don't listen I'd like to tell you you can just be good or bad don't say anything you can be cleansed of this I know a way I will talk to the priest at the sanctuary of elath and stonehouse
[89:52.27]If he hears from me, he will help you.
[89:54.12]His name is Dilan.
[89:55.28]He's a good man.
[89:55.82]Oh, Dilan!
[89:56.40]Don't listen to her.
[89:57.18]I gotta pee so bad.
[89:57.94]She has no idea who you are.
[89:59.46]She knows nothing of your power.
[90:02.10]I do.
[90:03.18]I saved your life.
[90:04.68]She's been using you.
[90:07.26]Murder, murder, cleanse, cleanser.
[90:08.94]She wants you to renounce your power?
[90:10.86]What sort of a friend is that?
[90:13.95]Right now, we have to stop Arantir before he uses the skull to destroy all of Stonehelm, if not more.
[90:22.42]Okay, so you lead the way.
[90:25.74]This is why she's still alive.
[90:26.90]Because she can leave the breadcrumb trail where I can follow right behind her and know where to go.
[90:36.27]You know, she's probably just going to die anyways.
[90:38.41]If she's killable by me, that means she's just going to die.
[90:40.77]Like up here.
[90:41.31]Arantir is going to pull her soul out of her body.
[90:47.61]Oh, goddammit.
[90:48.87]I want to like just...
[90:55.31]Did you like being down there?
[90:59.35]We go all the way back up just for her to go all the way back down.
[91:04.79]Lift it up with your magic ability.
[91:10.18]Be gone.
[91:11.58]She can heal you in battles?
[91:12.62]Yeah, just keep her around.
[91:15.02]Thanks for showing me where to go, too.
[91:16.90]That was really nice of you.
[91:22.88]How many more times are we doing this joke?
[91:25.00]Uh, zero.
[91:26.52]We've got to the end of that joke.
[91:29.68]It wasn't even a joke.
[91:30.32]It was just me just kicking her.
[91:33.77]Shit.
[91:34.11]She's going to follow me.
[91:34.77]You lead the way.
[91:35.93]Escape through the portal.
[91:36.75]Come on.
[91:37.11]You've got to lead the way here.
[91:39.45]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[91:41.47]God damn it.
[91:41.95]I don't know where I'm going.
[91:43.35]You need to do this.
[91:51.14]Shit.
[91:52.37]She's now a follower.
[91:53.77]You're supposed to be a leader.
[91:56.43]Go straight to the elevator.
[92:04.57]She's outlived her usefulness.
[92:08.00]Where's the way out?
[92:12.56]No, she's not useless yet.
[92:16.64]No.
[92:18.24]Where's that elevator?
[92:21.93]Is it through here?
[92:24.05]Oh, how the tables turn.
[92:26.39]Do I go straight through this into there to go to the elevator?
[92:32.29]I totally forgot about this, but I forgot already.
[92:34.62]I did.
[92:35.06]I just don't know.
[92:36.44]There's so many fucking random places.
[92:44.44]I told you, I don't do well with a game that doesn't give me a compass.
[92:57.87]You live another day.
[93:04.49]Alzheimer's?
[93:05.79]No.
[93:07.05]No, it's just like... It's just so... No, open the door.
[93:13.36]Get over here.
[93:20.98]Hold on, hold on.
[93:21.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[93:26.70]Damn it!
[93:27.14]I was trying to get her head crushed.
[93:33.88]Boring good ending?
[93:35.15]What do you mean, good ending?
[93:45.99]Jeremy, you have to drink.
[93:47.05]I've been drinking the same one cider for the last hour and 40 minutes.
[93:53.31]It's kind of gross now, actually.
[93:59.78]Alright, now she's the one going the right way.
[94:01.70]Okay.
[94:01.88]What?
[94:02.06]What's the fastest way to get out of here?
[94:22.85]Okay.
[94:23.61]Like, I don't care.
[94:24.11]I'm not doing any, like, let's just get the fuck out of here as fast as possible.
[94:28.69]We're going through the Kool-Aid portal again.
[94:39.72]No, I can't.
[94:43.24]We're done.
[94:46.97]I can't.
[94:47.45]She might be useful later.
[94:48.43]Return to Stormhelm via the sewers.
[94:53.52]Sewers, huh?
[94:57.04]Where the fuck was that?
[94:59.62]Into the sewers.
[95:02.90]Time to remember more things from like four hours ago.
[95:08.95]This way?
[95:10.17]This looks like a sewer to me.
[95:14.01]Chapter 9, City of Flames.
[95:18.24]Shut up.
[95:19.18]Boring good guy.
[95:20.91]What?
[95:21.13]I'm a good guy?
[95:22.67]See how many people I fucking murdered and tortured?
[95:25.11]Good guy, huh?
[95:26.03]Jerma, why are you such a good guy?
[95:27.09]Does this look like a good guy?
[95:28.49]Good guy, huh?
[95:50.89]Jeremy's such a good guy.
[95:51.95]Yeah, good guy.
[95:52.85]A good guy bashing a fucking guy's head against the wall like this over and over again?
[95:59.50]Good guy, huh?
[96:02.70]Go down with the current where the shit is.
[96:08.25]Such a good guy.
[96:14.95]Merciful.
[96:15.93]This guy again.
[96:16.63]Poring good guy.
[96:17.43]Chaotic good.
[96:17.89]I needed him.
[96:19.55]Okay, I didn't do that.
[96:43.57]I didn't do that.
[96:44.23]Okay, if Percy dies, the mission's over.
[96:50.02]Hold on, wait.
[96:50.76]What?
[96:51.04]Did I lose?
[96:51.82]Hold on, is that the guy that I need to protect?
[96:54.98]Which one of these guys is Duncan?
[97:00.42]Finally, some fucking action.
[97:05.60]See you later, Duncan.
[97:14.27]If Duncan, apparently that wasn't Duncan.
[97:16.17]Get over there.
[97:24.26]Ollie is, ugh, come on.
[97:25.46]You're like taking up too much space on the bed.
[97:27.14]Oh, come on.
[97:31.80]That guy was taking up too much room on the bear.
[97:34.94]Alright, let's save, we're gonna save this guy.
[97:43.73]You're not gonna die on my watch, no.
[97:45.55]Let's go.
[97:48.99]You and me.
[97:57.08]You fucking... How am I supposed to protect that guy if he sucks?
[98:07.14]Does anybody have any clue about that one?
[98:17.32]Over it!
[98:17.72]Get over it!
[98:18.44]Get over it!
[98:23.32]Good guy.
[98:23.84]Just break their backs on the walls and they'll melt over like a chocolate box.
[98:32.03]If the game thinks that they're going over an edge, then they die.
[98:44.29]See, the game thought he was going over the edge so it cut his throat.
[98:51.77]I was like, let's process if that guy was going over the edge.
[98:55.45]Slit his throat.
[98:58.27]Take a watch.
[98:59.72]Throat slit.
[99:00.58]How many more fucking people are there?
[99:02.24]For the love of all that is sacred.
[99:08.18]This day just never ends, so we gotta go.
[99:10.56]Find Percy.
[99:13.64]I don't think these guys stop.
[99:15.49]And that's a dead end.
[99:20.84]Anybody in there?
[99:21.38]No.
[99:22.06]This is all blocked off.
[99:22.92]All blocked off.
[99:23.54]This way.
[99:26.72]Blocked off.
[99:28.64]Blocked off.
[99:29.92]Blocked off.
[99:32.10]Up these stairs.
[99:36.47]Where's fucking Percy?
[99:46.91]Come on, Percival.
[100:03.13]You want to see a demon?
[100:04.07]I'll show you a fucking demon.
[100:17.64]That's it, right?
[100:19.16]I cut his arm off.
[100:22.95]Um... Do I have to climb up there?
[100:26.71]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[100:34.97]I can't open up these doors.
[100:54.71]rope boat, but I mean... What, like up there?
[100:58.41]And then jump in the building?
[101:00.61]I guess.
[101:09.38]I killed... That was not Percy.
[101:10.36]That was Duncan, actually.
[101:11.84]Well, that didn't work.
[101:19.82]Don't do this to me.
[101:20.62]Don't do it.
[101:21.84]I just want to climb up.
[101:30.73]Fucking asshole game.
[101:35.51]I killed Percy in the sewer.
[101:36.73]What are you talking about?
[101:37.43]I haven't even met Percy yet.
[101:41.11]Percy's like in one of these buildings.
[101:50.56]Is this not what I'm supposed to be doing, by the way?
[101:52.84]I don't think it is.
[101:58.29]I'm just like hanging like a fucking kid on a playground.
[102:05.79]Find Percy.
[102:15.84]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[102:20.02]None of the doors open.
[102:22.82]Like up here?
[102:27.44]Can I climb up this?
[102:28.78]Okay, well I got in a building.
[102:37.79]Daggers of frost.
[102:39.83]Interesting.
[102:40.47]Okay.
[102:45.05]Well.
[102:47.79]Alright.
[102:50.65]Let me pick the one random place where I'm able to jump and go down.
[103:09.66]He fucking burped and died.
[103:19.07]He goes, oh my, I nearly rotted.
[103:32.66]Bring out the freeze.
[103:35.72]Bring out the fucking freeze.
[103:37.08]Oh my god, you glitched ass fucking game.
[103:38.94]Seriously.
[103:39.40]Honest to fucking god damn god.
[103:51.38]Fucking broken ass fucking game.
[103:53.54]Seriously.
[103:58.20]That's what I wanted to do.
[104:00.23]When I just held my hands up, my tiny little fucking baby hands.
[104:04.97]If you press a button too fast, it don't fucking do anything.
[104:11.74]Go up here.
[104:13.44]Not that way.
[104:15.28]Not that way.
[104:22.11]Percy hates you.
[104:28.43]Mission failed.
[104:28.91]Percy hates you now.
[104:30.65]Okay.
[104:33.93]Sorry.
[104:34.25]Thanks, Percy.
[104:38.08]Break.
[104:43.08]Fuck out of my fucking way.
[104:48.38]I don't care about anybody but me right now.
[104:53.63]That guy's gonna die in a second anyways, so who cares?
[105:03.64]Alright, open the door.
[105:04.88]Get rid of the ghouls and I'll let you in.
[105:10.84]There's a ghoul over here.
[105:21.29]Right in front of you, friend.
[105:25.27]Good guy streamer.
[105:26.29]Well, we have to be a good guy because Percy has to open the door for us.
[105:37.52]That was a nice dodge, I'll give you that.
[105:46.88]Just kick him in the fire.
[105:49.03]These barrels are all on fire for a reason.
[105:50.69]Like, just pick it up and throw it.
[105:56.65]Where's this other guy?
[106:04.81]Okay.
[106:05.47]Open the door.
[106:08.32]There's more.
[106:11.22]How many of these guys do I have to kill before he trusts me?
[106:15.03]You can't open the door and, like, let me in?
[106:16.63]Die, please!
[106:17.11]Oh my god.
[106:25.37]There's one more.
[106:42.38]Okay.
[106:43.34]Okay.
[106:44.28]Let me in.
[106:46.24]Open the door.
[106:49.76]Open the door!
[106:50.54]See how you like it out there!
[106:54.78]Wait a minute.
[107:01.49]It's okay.
[107:12.98]Boo, just kill him instantly.
[107:14.44]He doesn't do anything.
[107:15.34]Oh, there's a guy here.
[107:17.02]Bow of fiery rage.
[107:18.04]I can't even pick up this shit.
[107:19.52]Let's let this dumb cutscene play out.
[107:21.39]I gotta pee so bad.
[107:23.17]This is the source engine, yes it is.
[107:30.95]Percy, you.
[107:31.83]Come on.
[107:32.03]Come on, what the fuck?
[107:59.79]That was a perfect opportunity and I can't put him in the room.
[108:02.64]Oh well.
[108:02.88]Joke fail.
[108:26.35]I gotta pee.
[108:26.77]Be right back.
[108:27.57]I had to do that before I had to pee.
[108:28.45]I'll be right back.
[110:49.55]Alright, let's go.
[110:51.37]Let's do... Anybody... Let's see.
[110:56.19]No, we're good.
[110:57.88]We are good.
[110:59.42]Turn this off.
[111:00.24]Pull this back out.
[111:00.98]There we go.
[111:09.94]Get Percy to the other side of the plaza guarded by the Cyclops.
[111:15.62]An undead Cyclops, by the way.
[111:17.66]So is that... Is he going to come out?
[111:24.67]After you, my friend.
[111:27.17]Got lost in the bathroom.
[111:28.83]I could have.
[111:29.23]I very well could have.
[111:33.35]So what's going on?
[111:33.93]Where is he?
[111:39.84]Wait.
[111:40.20]Alright.
[111:40.74]Kill the Cyclops.

[113:04.49]He's mad.
[113:04.95]He's going to look in here again.
[113:08.47]Hello.

[114:27.08]Fuck, Jesus.
[114:30.16]Get up.
[114:32.38]Oh, shit.
[114:36.48]Do I have any potions?
[114:37.24]I do, right?
[114:37.80]Where are they?
[114:46.94]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[114:48.90]Are you serious, dude?
[114:51.06]Why are you running over here?
[114:53.46]Oh, what a distraction that guy just was.
[114:55.04]Come on.
[115:08.47]Now he's getting fucking angry.
[115:10.51]Come on.
[115:13.09]This is optional, I know, but this is gonna work.
[115:25.85]How many fucking times do I have to do this to this guy?
[115:29.09]For real.
[115:39.40]Get the shrink shit.
[115:41.04]Ooh.
[115:45.34]Shrink.
[115:51.16]Come here, you.
[115:54.86]Shrink.
[115:57.35]Didn't do anything yet.
[115:58.29]Doesn't do anything.
[116:07.20]Okay, shrink him.
[116:13.86]Shrink.
[116:15.94]Shrink him.
[116:17.00]Oh my god, I can't shrink him with full adrenaline, really?
[116:25.25]It didn't work.
[116:32.08]Shrink didn't work with full adrenaline.
[116:35.72]I have full adrenaline.
[116:36.76]Pull it out.
[116:39.10]Shrink.
[116:41.10]Shrink him.
[116:41.68]That's not shrink.
[116:45.51]Not doing anything.
[116:46.85]It has to be for normal monsters.
[116:52.41]Alright, this ain't fucking working.
[116:58.18]Like, I'm gonna try this like one more time.
[117:03.00]And then I'm done.
[117:05.12]I'm gonna keep moving.
[117:19.86]Is that it?
[117:20.20]Thank god.
[117:29.31]Do I get, actually, do I get points for this?
[117:36.07]There we go, four skill points.
[117:37.83]It might not have been worth it, but whatever.
[117:47.96]I missed him.
[117:50.42]Oh, that was fucking Percy.
[117:51.82]Oh my god.
[117:56.58]This is Percy.
[117:57.44]I thought it was a random townsperson.
[118:05.29]He is a regular towns guy, though.
[118:09.67]Alright, let's go.
[118:15.11]Nice.
[118:21.30]Same thing.
[118:22.38]Really?
[118:22.66]Okay.
[118:32.98]What should I do?
[118:34.62]Should I purge or should I stay with it?
[118:40.42]The bridge.
[118:42.92]Purge it?
[118:44.10]Do it?
[118:44.52]Purge the Xanos?
[118:48.44]Alright, well... Okay, hold on.
[118:52.80]Give me a second here, dude.
[118:53.60]Let me save it.
[118:55.46]We're going to pull.
[118:57.76]Pull.
[118:59.32]Should I purge it or should I not?
[119:03.97]Purge Xanos.
[119:05.97]I don't even know if I'm spelling the name right.
[119:10.73]So this is Purge the Evil Demon.
[119:12.83]It's going to write Purge Demon.
[119:16.05]Yes or no.
[119:17.71]And by the time we get there, I'm going to look at it and we'll see.
[119:22.01]There's the poll.
[119:22.61]Let's see what you guys want me to do.
[119:25.79]And I'm just going to keep playing.
[119:26.79]There you go.
[119:31.07]Do it again.
[119:36.74]I think my chat is broken.
[119:40.63]My chat is broken.
[119:42.15]I don't know what it is with Twitch, but when I decide to type in my own fucking chat, I disconnect from the chat.
[119:49.86]I don't understand.
[119:50.40]I don't know how many times I have to put a link in my own chat before I disconnect from it.
[119:56.82]What is this shit?
[119:59.88]Alright, we'll let that go.
[120:00.64]For the time being.
[120:05.12]fix us let's get to the well and when I get there we'll look like I posted that link in chat like seven different times alright he wants me to jump across then he's gonna jump too right that was close okay jump percy ah the bridge
[120:32.66]Are you alright?
[120:33.42]I'll try to find another way through.
[120:35.66]If I... I'm sorry.
[120:38.88]I know.
[120:39.54]I keep doing this shit.
[120:40.71]I gotta stop it.
[120:42.15]I just gotta play.
[120:43.11]I gotta stop this shit.
[120:46.63]That was close.
[120:48.53]Okay, jump, Percy!
[120:53.63]Ah, the bridge!
[120:55.64]Are you alright?
[120:56.62]I'll try to find another way through.
[120:58.08]If I can, I'll run around and beat you just up the street.
[121:01.63]If we didn't need him, I'd tell him to just keep running.
[121:06.13]Annoying man.
[121:06.81]Okay.
[121:10.93]Sorry, Percy.
[121:15.47]Find Percy.
[121:16.03]Found him.
[121:16.39]There he is.
[121:28.68]Watch out for the monsters.
[121:33.88]Is that Percy?
[121:35.78]I don't know.
[121:36.06]Is this Percy?
[121:36.66]I don't think that's Percy.
[121:38.61]Percy looks the same as everybody else.
[121:42.19]Let's shrink these people.
[121:47.03]Shrink.
[121:49.59]Oh, I guess it only works when it's fully charged.
[121:51.31]Okay.
[121:54.91]I got his head off.
[121:56.91]That works?
[122:06.20]Okay, and then kill this guy.
[122:07.91]Backstab.
[122:08.61]Nice work.
[122:19.53]Don't accidentally hit this guy, please.
[122:23.71]I'm gonna accidentally hit the fucking guy, and he's gonna get in the goddamn way.
[122:29.23]That was a front stab, but that's okay.
[122:31.71]I'm just going to keep moving.
[122:32.69]I don't think I need to do anything particularly weird here.
[122:35.65]Some baked potatoes.
[122:42.43]A chain to grab.
[122:43.46]Okay, up here?
[122:56.64]I guess.
[122:57.49]Let's move, uh... This is a fully heal.
[123:03.25]I wanna do- I wanna weaken somebody.
[123:06.39]Okay.
[123:06.49]Use the cleanse.
[123:29.54]So this is to get rid of her, I think.
[123:32.14]Shadowsteel armor.
[123:33.06]Alright, back from where you came.
[123:35.80]What the fuck?
[123:40.85]Get... Go home.
[123:44.69]Endless quivers.
[123:45.31]I don't have... Short sword.
[123:46.40]Throw...
[123:53.62]Where's the... Where's the fucking autosave?
[123:56.38]I don't even fucking know.
[124:01.92]Fucking goddammit, hold on.
[124:10.95]My fucking internet is such a piece of goddamn shit.
[124:18.25]The amount of times I, like, lose connection to my own services makes me want to throw up blood.
[124:26.58]Just get it?
[124:27.06]Go get it.
[124:28.30]I could go get it.
[124:29.61]It's true.
[124:30.01]Okay.
[124:37.61]Where is it?
[124:37.99]Sorry, I have a gigantic fucking shield in the way.
[124:47.37]That was probably good to... Wait a minute.
[124:54.11]Ten oh, one oh five.
[124:56.23]I'm fucking loading the autosave.
[124:59.13]That was so painful.
[125:01.12]It's right here anyways.
[125:02.06]Somebody's taking a bath.
[125:04.08]Alright, what's the pole look like?
[125:05.68]Kick him, kick him!
[125:06.98]What the fuck is happening?
[125:26.55]I JUST SAVED THE GAME!
[125:43.43]There's one- It's alright, there's one before it.
[125:45.19]There is one before it.
[125:52.36]It's this one, okay.
[125:53.70]Jesus.
[125:54.66]Fucking.
[125:56.60]God.
[126:03.65]This time, just kick him off before he even gets up here.
[126:12.95]Again, get rid of him.
[126:16.25]Now pick up the fucking armor.
[126:18.47]Okay, my inventory's full.
[126:19.67]Calm down.
[126:20.99]Throw it off the edge.
[126:22.09]Throw the stupid fucking cleaver off the edge.
[126:24.63]Throw the short sword off the edge.
[126:26.51]Throw the longbow off the edge.
[126:30.31]I mean, this one's plus 9, plus 18.
[126:32.11]What the hell was that?
[126:40.21]Plus 6, plus 12, plus 9, plus 18.
[126:45.85]Soul Drinker.
[126:46.51]I mean, this one's kind of cool.
[126:47.55]I got the dumb Blacksmith Hammer still.
[126:51.68]Get rid of this.
[126:54.52]Bow of Fiery Rage.
[126:55.76]I don't have, like, Archery or anything.
[127:00.43]Get rid of this.
[127:00.97]I have two of these.
[127:05.31]Stoneskin Potion.
[127:06.37]I have eight of these.
[127:13.77]Fuck it, whatever.
[127:14.33]Okay, that's good.
[127:15.15]I'll just pick this damn thing up.
[127:18.23]What is this?
[127:19.81]Shadowsteel, plus four.
[127:21.20]Adds plus four armor class.
[127:23.80]I need... Adds plus ten health needs, plus three endurance.
[127:31.35]Well, I can't do that now.
[127:32.29]I need, like, another point in strength.
[127:34.81]Oh, shit.
[127:38.85]Alt-tabbed.
[127:42.67]Ah, well, okay.
[127:44.11]Let's take a look at the poll.
[127:46.87]Uh, purging the demon, uh, the poll, thank you for voting, is 54% said yes.
[127:53.28]The vote, the poll is done.
[127:55.18]We are purging the demon.
[128:00.12]This is a democracy.
[128:02.18]We're purging the demon.
[128:05.80]We're gonna... Purge, brah.
[128:09.46]Sorry, guys.
[128:10.23]We are purging the demon.
[128:15.15]No, we need a recount.
[128:16.45]There was a chance.
[128:18.63]There was a chance for everybody to vote.
[128:21.95]It's not like I didn't give you the opportunity.
[128:23.79]Fuck.
[128:25.24]Wow, she really doesn't want me to get purged.
[128:45.56]Destroy her.
[128:47.46]Democracy was a mistake.
[128:50.13]There was interference.
[128:51.77]No.
[128:52.21]Do it.
[128:52.73]No.
[128:53.11]Anything.
[128:53.61]Anything.
[128:53.95]Yes.
[128:54.31]Please.
[128:57.91]Oh, God.
[128:58.33]Not this time.
[129:00.23]Sorry, lady.
[129:17.48]We've been purged.
[129:18.28]Wait, does it keep coming to Earth?
[129:22.72]Yeah.
[129:23.02]Nice.
[129:23.38]There we go.
[129:24.08]I'm gonna get like a fucking heal.
[129:44.77]Oh, we get weapons and shit?
[129:52.85]Chat was right.
[129:56.21]Chat was fucking right.
[129:57.21]Look at these things.
[130:02.34]Oh boy, oh boy.
[130:05.08]Daggers of the Dragon Fang.
[130:06.70]Staff of the Dragon Bone.
[130:08.04]Bow of the Dragon Horn.
[130:10.14]And skill points.
[130:13.02]Look at all this stuff.
[130:13.68]Alright, let's see.
[130:16.65]Staff of the Dragonstone.
[130:17.99]Holy shit.
[130:18.79]Okay.
[130:21.43]Lightning Daggers.
[130:22.59]Daggers of the Dragonfang.
[130:25.35]Stealth 3, which I don't have.
[130:27.05]Versus Undead.
[130:32.73]Realistically, this is the only one I can get to use.
[130:35.04]This one that's plus 9.
[130:36.04]The Sword of the Dragonclaw.
[130:38.80]I need 10, 73 more points.
[130:42.90]Adrenaline.
[130:44.90]Critical hit.
[130:48.82]Dragon bow.
[130:49.88]It's cool, but I don't have any points into archery, so I'm not going to do it.
[130:56.88]You idiot.
[130:57.46]You could have got a sex scene, but you chose to purge.
[130:59.44]I didn't choose to purge.
[131:01.77]I didn't choose this at all.
[131:07.15]I gave you guys the opportunity to choose.
[131:10.43]You guys chose that.
[131:11.33]I didn't choose that.
[131:13.58]For me, I don't know what I would have done.
[131:15.14]Maybe something different.
[131:15.94]Who knows?
[131:17.95]I want to take this ring off.
[131:20.91]All my rings are terrible.
[131:27.34]Ring, I guess.
[131:30.68]Well, cool.
[131:33.10]We did it.
[131:34.90]Find Percy.
[131:42.07]How do I get out of here?
[131:42.91]Do I have to clean this up to leave?
[131:47.88]Was there a door I could go into?
[131:49.17]Or do I pray here for eternity?
[131:51.59]Where's my escape route?
[132:03.14]How do I get out of here?
[132:03.92]Oh.
[132:24.82]You knew it was gonna happen.
[132:26.34]They just... How else was I gonna do that?
[132:30.54]Alright, uh... That was the optional thing.
[132:32.79]Gotta go down again.
[132:33.69]Just go up behind him and start breathing.
[132:38.45]What is this?
[132:38.83]Is this like a secret?
[132:42.29]This is like a little secret, I think.
[132:51.86]Nope.
[132:52.80]Not a secret.
[132:54.49]Not a secret.
[133:09.68]Doesn't mean I can't be a bad guy still.
[133:16.06]The secret is...
[133:19.83]Anything else?
[133:21.39]Well, they're gonna start spawning all these things on me.
[133:27.63]Anybody in the outhouse?
[133:30.18]Is there an Easter egg in here?
[133:31.52]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[133:36.18]I gotta assume we have to be getting painfully close to the end of the game.
[133:41.52]What, like one more chapter?
[133:43.96]The last chapter, which is just like the last boss or something?
[133:48.97]We have to find Percy as I kill the Cyclops.
[133:52.61]Now where do I go from there?
[133:54.21]I don't know.
[133:59.14]What the fuck is Percy?
[134:01.84]Percy?
[134:17.77]I think he was right there, right?
[134:21.91]He ran around this way, I think.
[134:23.11]At least he tried to, right?
[134:25.03]The bridge is over there.
[134:29.25]Just cut his whole body in half.
[134:34.47]Come on, hit it.
[134:35.95]Come on!
[134:36.41]There we go.
[134:41.37]Goodbye, head.
[134:47.15]Kill the priests?
[134:48.31]Why would I kill the priests?
[134:50.73]There's another one.
[134:51.35]Okay, bring them back to here.
[134:52.43]Oh, they just fucking swarmed everybody.
[134:56.06]What the fuck?
[134:57.44]And now, I just got triple tapped.
[134:59.42]Did you guys see that shit?
[135:01.72]I got triple tapped.
[135:02.76]It was like... God, this is fucking annoying.
[135:18.63]Where am I going?
[135:19.59]Is that a bad guy?
[135:25.60]I can't even tell who's down there.
[135:26.80]Okay, it's a good guy.
[135:34.73]Where's Barry?
[135:37.25]Who am I looking for?
[135:38.07]Oh, god damn it.
[135:52.18]These things are the most deadly enemy in the game.
[136:00.80]He went this way.
[136:03.32]I figured once that door would be open, he would just walk through it or something.
[136:10.87]So many of them.
[136:11.49]And they do so much fucking damage.
[136:13.31]I hate these things.
[136:15.93]I'm about to spawn the fucking Cyclops.
[136:17.61]I'm not even kidding.
[136:19.67]Oh.
[136:32.88]Fucking idiot.
[136:33.40]Yeah, you're a real intelligent.
[136:36.24]Intelligent guy.
[136:36.96]Come on.
[136:41.40]Hit me.
[136:44.47]There's a guy behind me, too.
[136:45.45]Like, what the fuck is even hitting me right now?
[136:47.23]I have no idea.
[136:48.39]I... I... I... Shrink them.
[136:53.65]I can't shrink them unless I have adrenaline.
[136:57.86]So now let me take a little look and see where the hell I am.
[137:05.69]It's a high IQ golem.
[137:08.39]No, it's an actually dangerous golem.
[137:14.53]Oh, man.
[137:15.83]Oh, man, I hate these things.
[137:19.81]Why is it only these fucking dumb, stupid, like, golem enemies?
[137:24.53]What happened to the orcs?
[137:26.03]Remember how fucking cool the orcs were?
[137:32.65]I found a secret.
[137:33.94]A secret booze.
[137:40.15]Ring of the Phoenix.
[137:44.67]What the hell is that?
[137:48.68]Ring of Fire Protection and Regeneration.
[137:50.10]Where is it?
[137:52.32]Weapon Master.
[137:54.00]Another Ring of the Phoenix.
[137:54.92]That's just one of these dumb things.
[138:00.51]Secret Keg Body.
[138:08.02]Alright, well.
[138:10.10]Nothing else up there, I don't think.
[138:15.47]What?
[138:20.33]This is the door that I opened.
[138:31.35]These guys do the most damage in the game and are the hardest to kill.
[138:34.19]These guys are harder to kill than Cyclopses.
[138:42.29]Uh, alright, I'm just getting turned the fuck around.
[138:44.57]I have to go let Barry in.
[138:50.08]Wherever the hell that's gonna be.
[138:53.10]Hey, I'm just gonna pop around!
[138:54.24]I'm just gonna pop a squad, I'm gonna go around!
[138:56.34]Alright, alright, alright, Percy.
[139:00.50]That's cool.
[139:05.86]Darn him.
[139:12.96]this game open world is it is a linear game you can choose where you want to go but it's it's linear but it's open world in the sense that you have no idea where the you're even going there's no indication of where you are ever so it's it's an open lost game it's a game where you like openly get lost the whole game
[139:41.77]Three of them.
[139:42.91]This is fantastic.
[139:46.23]Drink, bro.
[139:50.54]Can I open this door?
[139:51.48]I can.
[139:52.24]I don't think they're smart enough to open doors.
[139:59.31]Stay close.
[140:00.75]Get away from me.
[140:05.11]Why is there a loading screen to go in this building?
[140:13.09]Master thief outfit?
[140:15.71]Where the hell am I?
[140:22.60]So much of this.
[140:24.94]I don't know what to throw away.
[140:26.60]Lightning daggers, I guess.
[140:28.16]I might need those later.
[140:30.14]I'm such a hoarder.
[140:31.04]I just collect everything.
[140:42.47]I don't care about any of that mana stuff right now.
[140:46.65]Let's check and see what this is like.
[140:49.13]Bought a stew, get rid of it.
[140:51.59]What's that armor?
[140:54.63]Stealth three.
[140:55.53]Okay.
[140:56.85]Get the fuck out of here.
[141:08.44]Love it, that just sounds like popcorn.
[141:15.52]Percy?
[141:15.84]Is that Percy?
[141:21.67]I don't think this is Percy.
[141:26.43]He's dead, whoever he is.
[141:29.38]Any one of these guys can be Percy, by the way.
[141:32.22]Lightning shield, I already have one of those.
[141:33.68]Let me just make sure I'm not missing anything.
[141:42.19]I could be.
[141:44.25]Didn't explore the house fully.
[141:48.25]Uh-huh.
[141:49.99]Health potion.
[141:50.72]Can the bed be moved?
[141:52.24]No.
[141:52.60]I can go upstairs, though.
[141:56.32]Let's climb the ladder in the attic and just see what's up there.
[142:12.30]Okay, I have to hold S to climb this ladder.
[142:15.84]By the way, not W. How does that make any sense?
[142:19.13]Secret!
[142:21.91]There's a fire trap right there.
[142:23.39]Don't step on that.
[142:25.51]A bunch of useless scrolls.
[142:29.89]And what else?
[142:32.01]Nothing?
[142:33.85]That's it?
[142:34.25]There's no special secret up here?
[142:36.79]Just a chest with scrolls in it and a trap?
[142:39.76]I just tried to get rid of all these scrolls.
[142:41.30]I don't want any more of them.
[142:44.04]The whole point was to throw these away.
[142:45.45]Well, whatever.
[142:53.57]Can't open this door.
[142:54.41]Don't forget the wheel.
[142:57.87]How could I forget this wheel?
[142:58.87]Alright, let's go.
[143:07.58]Right into the fucking poison.
[143:10.20]Damn it, man.
[143:10.72]I'm just going to take one of the antidotes.
[143:16.46]Why is he back?
[143:19.20]That just actually scared the kind of shit out of me.
[143:22.57]This is not a pot.
[143:23.21]That was an antidote.
[143:25.51]Apparently not.
[143:26.29]Alright, let's go.
[143:28.57]Out, out, out, out, out, out with you.
[143:33.95]That doesn't open.
[143:39.97]Fuck you guys.
[143:41.55]I ain't fucking sitting around here all day.
[143:47.94]That door open.
[143:54.36]Get the fuck away from me, please.
[143:56.78]I don't want anything to do with you guys.
[144:03.27]Secret.
[144:05.41]Wait, is that a... I think this is a guy that I threw.
[144:08.77]Wait, is this the... Some lady.
[144:12.47]Did I kill that lady?
[144:14.11]I don't remember.
[144:17.68]Jerma, stop playing this game.
[144:18.92]It's too much.
[144:20.22]I have to finish it.
[144:21.82]We're so close to the end.
[144:22.90]I can't just not... I have to finish the game.
[144:26.24]We're too close to the end to not finish it.
[144:28.39]If Percy hates you or dies, your mission's a failure.
[144:34.41]Okay, so here he is.
[144:36.69]I thought he was dead.
[144:40.33]Alright, where are we going?
[144:44.29]Alright, let's go.
[144:48.55]We're making our way to the climax of the game.
[144:52.03]I'm not going to kick him off the edge.
[144:53.15]I'm not going to kill him.
[144:53.97]No.
[144:54.27]No.
[145:07.16]Wait.
[145:07.90]Did he say, that's the valve?
[145:13.05]He pointed and said, that's the valve.
[145:16.91]Alright, we're going to shrink one of these guys.
[145:19.79]One of these guys has to get shrunk.
[145:24.85]I need to see if it's any funnier or any fun.
[145:34.36]Valve jokes?
[145:36.41]I don't need to make a Valve joke right now.
[145:38.24]Christ.
[145:45.88]You gotta throw three of these guys at me.
[145:49.24]Four of them?
[145:51.06]Okay, well, let's instantly kill them.
[145:56.16]Got two.
[145:57.13]Got two, that's good.
[145:57.83]I'm okay with that.
[145:58.47]Got three, actually.
[146:03.01]Jesus.
[146:18.50]I wish there was a console command where you could remove enemies.
[146:20.74]I would just spam it on these guys right now.
[146:25.14]Stupid vampires.
[146:45.32]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[146:47.32]You can just step on them like an ant.
[146:53.18]He made like a little squeak sound too.
[146:59.62]There's not another one.
[147:00.60]Is there another one?
[147:01.50]Okay.
[147:06.54]So, let's take a look.
[147:09.27]Slow it down.
[147:10.05]Is there anywhere I can go over here?
[147:13.09]I can't go in there.
[147:15.90]Nowhere can be... Here's the valve.
[147:19.50]Just lift it up.
[147:23.07]Hey, thank you, Matters of Darkness, for the $5.
[147:25.93]Appreciate it.
[147:28.47]Swim up to the gate and access the sewers.
[147:31.67]Sure.
[147:37.57]Is Percy still in here?
[147:40.98]He did run in here.
[147:43.34]There he is.
[147:46.77]Wait, my... I just... I think I closed the gate.
[147:49.84]No, there we go.
[147:53.42]Is he talking?
[147:54.00]He looks like he's talking.
[148:01.61]No, he's gonna do that.
[148:02.73]Okay.
[148:09.53]No, you do that.
[148:13.52]While I get another secret.
[148:18.03]Secret area.
[148:20.91]Nothing in here.
[148:21.73]What about in this one?
[148:23.93]Bunch of fucking books.
[148:26.39]Scrolls that I don't want.
[148:30.15]And that's it.
[148:31.47]This is a real bummer of a secret area.
[148:36.49]Just some shitty potions.
[148:37.53]That's not cool.
[148:40.83]Let's go.
[148:46.28]Smash the ironing board.
[148:50.08]Let's take a swim.
[148:50.78]He's going to open up the gate.
[148:59.07]I think this is the... I think this is it.
[149:01.27]I think we're about to get to the last chapter.
[149:02.83]This is the end of the game coming up here.
[149:09.57]Thank you, Percy, for all your help.
[149:12.63]I have nine skill points.
[149:13.71]Is it enough to do anything?
[149:14.55]Let's see.
[149:17.96]Strength three is what I need.
[149:20.77]Can I do Strength 3?
[149:23.97]Not yet.
[149:25.55]Strength 3 gets me the Sword of the Dragon Claw.
[149:28.93]I need one more point to do that.
[149:36.82]I do have the Dragon Sword, but I can't use it yet.
[149:46.95]Dead guy.
[149:50.24]Uh-huh.
[149:52.22]Uh-huh.
[149:52.72]Can I make that jump?
[149:55.38]There's no reason to do that.
[149:57.64]I'm not gonna do any more item hunting.
[149:58.94]I already have all the items I need to, like, beat the game, I would assume.
[150:04.54]Oh, shit.
[150:07.64]Oh, god.
[150:08.34]I gotta kill this guy?
[150:09.24]I have to kill the dragon?
[150:10.66]I actually have to kill it?
[150:14.06]That's so horrible.
[150:15.24]Okay, well...
[150:19.50]How do you determine where to do this?
[150:22.79]I'm gonna go over here.
[150:23.51]Oh, he shot it out of my hands.
[150:30.35]What is this?
[150:30.73]Okay, I can like climb that.
[150:38.96]Just look over here first.
[150:44.86]Can I just jump up on him?
[150:46.88]I wonder if I can like jump and ride him or something.
[150:50.65]I don't know.
[150:55.00]Oh, that big one.
[150:58.14]Okay.
[151:00.08]Straight ahead.
[151:02.34]Shrink the dragon?
[151:04.56]That's a good idea.
[151:05.27]Okay, I gotta make the run.
[151:13.49]I can't just, like, sneak the fuck in there.
[151:14.93]Okay, here we go.
[151:17.76]Go!
[151:27.38]and come on hurry up I need adrenaline do I have like something that fills adrenaline almost there go alright I made it okay so what's in here
[151:44.13]Dragon's still outside.
[151:44.89]I've been fighting neck lords?
[151:46.39]What?
[151:46.65]Why do I hear neckbeards?
[151:47.89]I was busy fucking fending off neckbeards.
[152:17.13]Oh, too bad it doesn't open that door.
[152:26.76]That closed really fast.
[152:33.81]Um... Okay.
[152:39.62]This game is like Redneck Rampage, but good.
[152:46.29]to hold this thing the whole time, huh?
[152:50.60]Okay.
[152:52.48]That wasn't an optional object- I can't kill the dragon.
[152:55.06]That wasn't- It didn't say optional.
[152:58.14]It said I had to do it.
[153:01.79]Objective done.
[153:03.55]I killed the dragon.
[153:06.31]Enter the necropolis.
[153:07.07]Alright, let's put the last skill point into strength so I can use the dragon sword.
[153:13.48]Legendary Dragon Knight.
[153:14.74]It is plus 9 plus 18.
[153:16.18]So here we go.
[153:16.88]Throw this bad boy on.
[153:18.50]I also can use Soul Drinker.
[153:23.64]So this just gives me 30% lifesteal, but let's just see what this one is like first.
[153:31.20]There it is.
[153:36.96]So it just does more damage, I think.
[153:38.52]That's fine.
[153:41.91]Let's go to the Necropolis, the epilogue!
[153:45.19]We're at the end of the game.
[153:46.71]Find and take the Skull of Shadows from Erintir.
[153:50.45]Into the Necropolis.
[153:52.67]The Necropolis is... just the same thing we did before, the same game we saw before.
[153:57.53]Oh dear, this is... like that pain- Hello?
[154:10.37]Where is this guy?
[154:13.56]Almost just... Is he up here?
[154:16.54]I can't like even pay attention.
[154:36.99]Release my body into the great abyss, and I will speak with my father on your behalf.
[154:44.66]I'm not sure I have the time.
[154:47.44]Drop Istan's body into the abyss, thereby releasing him from torment.
[154:52.22]Destroy the four Lich Kings that have sealed the doors to the final chamber of the Necropolis.
[154:59.01]Where might those doors be, by the way?
[155:03.49]Uh, there's just shit everywhere.
[155:07.33]Shit's just floating around everywhere.
[155:09.01]There's no doors.
[155:09.75]Where are the doors?
[155:10.89]What doors?
[155:13.15]What are these fucking doors you speak of?
[155:20.96]Four kings.
[155:28.60]Well, this sword is good.
[155:29.36]Pfft.
[155:35.67]This sword is pretty good!
[155:47.49]That guy has a great Waluigi impression.
[155:49.47]Alright, where's the first king?
[156:02.28]You don't- you're not kings?
[156:10.74]Shit.
[156:15.72]Uh... Well... Shit.
[156:25.99]Mana potions.
[156:28.69]The Four Kings.
[156:30.75]I love how this is the epilogue, and this is gonna take a very long time.
[156:33.69]Is there, like, something I can rope-bow?
[156:38.40]Can I rope-bow something here?
[156:39.56]Like, there?
[156:39.96]There?
[156:41.97]Shoot that thing with the bow?
[156:52.16]Did I miss that body?
[156:59.42]I don't think that's how you do it.
[157:03.34]No.
[157:09.35]Don't think that's what you do.
[157:13.92]Good aim.
[157:14.40]I'm hitting him right in the fucking stomach.
[157:21.75]Use the rope bow?
[157:25.11]That's what I got on right now.
[157:29.43]I didn't miss any of these shots.
[157:31.13]I'm hitting him like right in the fucking back.
[157:43.57]Release him.
[157:46.83]Uh.
[157:51.83]Got him.
[157:52.13]Figured it out.
[157:54.85]I don't think that- I thought I figured it out.
[157:59.47]I thought I had it.
[158:07.31]Get off of there!
[158:08.72]Get the fuck off!
[158:12.14]Yeah, holy Jesus!
[158:17.02]Is that what I have to do?
[158:17.94]I have to like smash him into these things?
[158:23.85]I don't, I don't understand.
[158:31.05]Okay, I gotta like swing on it.
[158:35.83]That's not what you do!
[158:46.41]What a wrecking ball.
[158:49.45]Well, um... He's in the right spot right now for me to try to get a swing on him.
[158:57.69]Okay, this is not what you do.
[159:00.31]This is not how you do it.
[159:03.05]Very clearly, this is not what you do.
[159:05.01]So, I'm gonna go the other way.
[159:06.81]Yeah, this is... I don't... That's not what you do.
[159:14.20]I'm gonna go back to the stairs over here.
[159:21.69]Wherever the hell they are.
[159:32.91]Can this be, like, broken?
[159:34.39]Can I, like, pull?
[159:36.83]Okay.
[159:38.71]So I gotta go to the other side.
[159:39.67]Alright, well.
[159:43.40]There's one.
[159:55.98]Goodbye.
[159:56.44]I mean, can I grab onto it now?
[159:59.40]Or do I have to wrap all the way around?
[160:07.15]It just releases his body there.
[160:08.97]I don't think I can make that jump.
[160:15.29]As much as I would love to try this, I don't think I'm going to be able to make that.
[160:27.30]Would you please jump the fuck on?
[160:30.36]Just get on this.
[160:32.44]You fucking Source Engine game.
[160:34.82]Would you please get on top of this?
[160:40.12]Oh my fucking god.
[160:51.25]Can I jump up here?
[160:56.75]Holding- I am holding space.
[161:00.39]I'm holding- I'm crouch jumping, it don't matter.
[161:04.17]I don't even think that's what you're supposed to do anyways.
[161:09.09]And I think I may have just tangled him up.
[161:10.95]Oh, great.
[161:12.17]That's just fucking fantastic.
[161:24.74]Here.
[161:37.95]I love that there's just random guys that are going- I feel like- I keep thinking you guys are guards.
[161:41.71]That's why I'm not trying to kill you.
[161:42.79]The other one is right... Wait.
[161:50.70]Is that him connected to the chain?
[161:52.00]It is.
[161:52.24]Oh.
[162:01.77]Guard.
[162:07.05]Come over here!
[162:08.99]Come on.
[162:10.47]Just enough pressure and I'll be able to get you off.
[162:13.43]I'll be able to get you out of here.
[162:14.53]Ooh.
[162:20.30]That guy's freaking out.
[162:24.14]Why is this guy losing his mind over here?
[162:26.26]He can't believe it.
[162:32.80]Come on.
[162:33.32]Drag him over here.
[162:38.87]Jesus.
[162:43.89]All I hear are loud noises.
[162:46.15]What?
[162:47.93]What the... What the fuck, man?
[162:51.11]Like, why do you lose, like, 80% health sometimes?
[162:56.95]It doesn't even make any fucking sense.
[163:02.78]Like, legitimately, I just went from 70% health to zero.
[163:08.06]And one of these fucking stupid guys touched my body.
[163:10.48]Alright.
[163:19.90]Pull the other stupid sword out of the stone.
[163:21.53]I gotta, like, throw him back, aren't I?
[163:29.91]Where's it connected?
[163:30.61]Over there?
[163:30.97]Hold on.
[163:34.48]What else is over here?
[163:35.34]Nothing?
[163:39.67]This is Skyrim 2.
[163:42.85]Good thing I didn't have him break this.
[163:44.23]Because I need to pull this out.
[163:47.36]Alright, that's two.
[163:52.96]Who?
[163:54.94]Wait, is that... Wait, is that guy's body?
[163:57.58]That's...
[164:09.28]That's the guy I'm supposed to be rescuing?
[164:13.45]Oh, no.
[164:14.13]Where did his body go?
[164:14.91]Oh, shit.
[164:18.83]I don't know.
[164:19.53]He might not even be around.
[164:21.59]I might have just fucking ruined everything.
[164:41.74]You big ass shield.
[164:42.72]Get the fuck out of my way.
[164:45.08]I'm doing such a roundabout way to do this.
[164:46.78]I don't know where I just went.
[164:50.14]I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[164:51.90]Why did I come over here?
[165:01.89]I just like decided to do this.
[165:04.87]I'm probably just gonna die.
[165:13.31]Eat shit, game.
[165:14.96]You have freed me.
[165:17.58]Very well.
[165:18.48]Fucking facepalm, Jerma.
[165:19.72]Before I descend into the abyss, I will keep my word and mark you for my father's eyes.
[165:27.96]When he sees you, he will know you and your way will be opened.
[165:33.20]Go now and greet my lord.
[165:42.72]Didn't expect that, did you?
[165:46.02]No.
[165:48.62]Alright.
[165:56.12]Now where?
[165:58.51]I'm assuming we don't have to fight one of the four kings now.
[166:01.87]Because we helped, like, Grover's father or something.
[166:08.75]This guy got buried with a lot of mana potions.
[166:13.54]I can't even carry any more of these anyways.
[166:17.16]Okay.
[166:17.44]Fuck off.
[166:27.43]No, we like rescued Grover's father from certain doom.
[166:35.09]This sword is very nice though.
[166:36.57]I'm very much enjoying it.
[166:42.66]What else is here?
[166:44.18]Oh my god.
[166:46.30]Oh god.
[166:47.04]Oh god.
[166:48.94]What's that do?
[166:51.28]Got him!
[166:53.64]Get down!
[166:56.20]Got it!
[166:56.54]First try!
[166:56.88]Yeah, where's the fail fishes on that one, guys?
[167:07.12]Where's the way out for it?
[167:07.90]Do you remember socks?
[167:08.44]Do you remember can't do anything right?
[167:12.44]It's alright, though.
[167:13.06]Don't worry.
[167:14.42]Just gonna first try that guy.
[167:17.86]Could've panicked.
[167:20.40]Very easily could've panicked right there.
[167:21.68]No, he didn't.
[167:23.24]Made it happen.
[167:26.32]Bring on the four kings.
[167:28.66]Whoa!
[167:28.98]I almost just walked into that.
[167:30.02]I thought this was... I actually almost just did that.
[167:35.34]That would've been so embarrassing.
[167:38.31]Let's just go back up the stairs.
[167:39.47]I have a million health potions.
[167:47.43]How do I get back up?
[167:53.23]Is this the same guy that beat Dark Souls 3 on stream?
[167:55.86]Yep.
[167:56.78]That's me.
[168:00.26]From Failfish to PogChamp.
[168:02.20]Back to Failfish.
[168:05.42]Um.
[168:06.76]Well.
[168:09.74]Game is saved.
[168:12.84]Did I miss something right here?
[168:18.75]Why can I not do anything from here?
[168:20.92]Could I not see it?
[168:21.52]I don't think I can make this jump.
[168:25.64]No, I can't.
[168:29.10]Climb the stairs?
[168:31.33]And then what?
[168:31.77]There's nowhere else to go.
[168:40.85]Rope bow, but rope bow on what?
[168:42.38]There's no wood.
[168:46.65]What would you have me rope bow here?
[168:49.51]Guys?
[168:51.55]What would you have me rope bow, fellas?
[168:57.09]Nothing here to rope bow.
[169:02.65]What wood?
[169:04.23]There's no wood anywhere over here.
[169:05.37]You guys don't have the answer.
[169:10.40]That's not the answer.
[169:11.10]That's the incorrect answer.
[169:23.29]That ain't wood.
[169:29.43]Don't do it.
[169:31.70]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[169:34.72]I really thought it was gonna happen.
[169:39.24]Yeah, but from here, like, come on.
[169:41.03]I can't rope-bow anything.
[169:55.59]This thing keeps whispering at me.
[169:57.87]So what is this?
[170:06.39]Is he shooting balls at me?
[170:12.59]No.
[170:12.81]Then what?
[170:14.03]Now where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[170:17.65]Oh, this is going to be a real confusing mess, isn't it?
[170:22.83]The only thing that was in there was a couple of healing potions.
[170:25.09]Nothing else I can do.
[170:50.44]What the fuck just happened?
[170:54.41]How was I ever supposed to know that was gonna happen?
[170:58.10]Like, you stand on the edge and the thing falls down?
[171:07.30]This one does it too.
[171:09.02]You can see where it connects.
[171:13.65]That's it?
[171:14.09]That's all you're gonna do for me?
[171:15.03]You're just gonna make like a... You gotta use the rope bow on that thing.
[171:20.97]Shut up with the rope bow, alright?
[171:22.51]You don't have to use the fucking rope bow.
[171:28.38]I can't make that.
[171:29.20]Get out of the way.
[171:41.55]Is it this easy?
[171:43.01]No, it definitely isn't this easy.
[171:45.55]This is where I was before.
[171:46.37]I go around here.
[171:57.83]I guess.
[171:59.01]Is this gonna do anything for me though?
[172:04.23]What is that noise?
[172:09.65]Shoot rope bow into abyss.
[172:18.39]Ay yi yi.
[172:19.21]I'm just gonna stop fucking smashing shit.
[172:29.01]Save Ropebow five times.
[172:30.41]Maybe it'll work.
[172:38.71]He was supposed to be alive?
[172:44.44]I mean, I see wood over there, but there's nothing to, like, grab onto here.
[172:48.36]And I can't... I'm just gonna fall to my death if I do that.
[173:03.08]Jesus fucking Christ.
[173:09.20]I don't give a fuck.
[173:14.62]I ain't fucking walking around in circles anymore.
[173:17.28]Fuck this game.
[173:25.10]Such a confusing fucking mess.
[173:28.34]Fuck off, game.
[173:33.87]What's through this thing?
[173:34.63]I don't know.
[173:35.11]Who knows?
[173:44.13]Follow those orbs?
[173:44.98]There was like a hole in the fucking ceiling.
[173:49.52]I skipped three hours of content.
[173:52.14]Give me a fucking break.
[173:53.60]Alright, my patience is getting fucking thin.
[173:55.92]It's wearing- It's getting thin!
[173:58.06]It's getting thin.
[174:03.05]Go through the fuck.
[174:05.26]Oh my god.
[174:35.42]How did I beat Dark Souls 3?
[174:37.16]Cause Dark Souls 3 isn't a fucking mess like this game is.
[174:41.91]This game's a fucking mess.
[174:45.35]Dark Souls 3 wasn't just taking fucking wild guesses on where you're supposed to fucking go.
[174:49.28]How about up here?
[174:52.86]Follow the fucking fairies!
[175:08.47]Does she have bush might and magic?
[175:16.77]I'm trying to figure out what you're actually supposed to do here.
[175:23.99]Just use the rope, skip all the screens.
[175:27.10]I mean, there's that right there, but what is that?
[175:29.94]Let me see what's lit up over there.
[175:31.18]I'm actually curious how you're supposed to do this fucking dumb part of the game.
[175:37.24]There's no clip to the cutscene.
[175:38.63]I'm about to.
[175:42.11]Like... I can, like, go to there.
[175:50.35]I can't even jump anymore.
[175:52.93]Oh, my God.
[175:55.36]Can I even make it to there, though?
[175:56.30]I don't even know.
[176:01.18]There's no clip into the hole.
[176:02.62]Oh.
[176:04.94]This is worse than Blighttown.
[176:06.32]What the fuck?
[176:09.77]Where's the progression here?
[176:13.49]Is it just one tiny spot I have to rope bow?
[176:15.85]Is that what you guys are telling me?
[176:16.77]I have to rope bow something?
[176:26.84]I can jump to there, I think.
[176:28.36]Maybe I don't even be able to make it.
[176:33.31]No, yes, you need a rope bow.
[176:34.95]What spot is the rope bow spot?
[176:36.61]Nothing's wood here.
[176:40.56]Where's the fucking rope bow spot?
[177:01.18]I mean, I got up here, but... Is that the piece of fucking wood right there?
[177:14.08]No, it can't be.
[177:19.06]I didn't figure it out, though, because what the fuck am I supposed to do from here?
[177:21.17]There's nowhere to go from here.
[177:25.17]And it just pushed me off.
[177:26.61]It just glitched me off the fucking edge.
[177:31.83]Seriously, Jesus Christ.
[177:36.76]Why would you have to do this?
[177:40.42]Wrong side?
[177:41.20]How the fuck am I supposed to get to the other side?
[177:46.48]Why can't I just go play the game?
[177:48.44]Why do I have to, like, rope-bow these one random specific fucking areas?
[177:51.99]Like, I don't... I gotta rope-bow this one corner.
[178:05.03]And then I gotta fucking teeter-totter around this edge.
[178:09.83]Oh my god, I hate this.
[178:13.09]This is so... Oh my fucking god.
[178:17.89]I feel like I'm not supposed to be where I am right now.
[178:22.16]I feel like I'm not supposed to be here.
[178:24.22]I feel like this is a place I'm not supposed to go in the game.
[178:26.68]And he spawned in me.
[178:28.30]And I can't fucking move.
[178:32.98]Save it.
[178:40.15]Oh my god, what a mess.
[178:43.33]I gotta, like, knock that down.
[178:44.45]How did I knock that down before?
[178:51.29]I don't even fucking remember.
[178:55.82]Yeah, come on, boy.
[178:56.60]You gotta use the rope bow.
[179:04.28]There we go.
[179:04.86]And then, like, tightrope walk this.
[179:10.07]Watch out for the magician.
[179:15.25]Nothing else, right?
[179:17.20]I skipped this all, by the way.
[179:19.20]This was all done.
[179:19.76]I fell off the fucking edge.
[179:23.04]Like, oh my god, the collision detection is gonna make me wanna fucking smash a bottle into my own head.
[179:36.82]Get me the fuck out of here.
[179:38.62]I don't even care about the four kings anymore.
[179:43.05]Oh my god.
[179:52.17]Get it.
[179:53.51]Get it.
[179:54.87]Go in the hole.
[179:56.17]Save it here.
[179:56.65]Go in.
[179:59.87]I don't know.
[180:00.19]I'm too lazy to even climb that fucking rope, guys.
[180:16.90]Okay.
[180:19.38]That took way longer than it should have.
[180:22.36]I did it legit, though.
[180:24.28]I shot the one specific corner of the room that you needed to shoot the rope bow in.
[180:28.37]Hey, how about you fucking row your boat off the cliff?
[180:33.97]You fucking dingy.
[180:35.05]I see this one from a fucking mile.
[180:44.16]Climb it.
[180:49.83]Fuck off, Percy.
[180:55.65]I'm gonna fucking press a button.
[180:56.95]Where's the button?
[180:57.49]There's a button I gotta press somewhere.
[180:58.90]Where's the button?
[181:00.04]Where's the button you press?
[181:01.26]There's a button you press.
[181:02.36]Somewhere.
[181:04.16]You don't even need to press a button.
[181:05.38]You just gotta wait it out.
[181:06.12]Go.
[181:07.36]Is this the right way?
[181:08.10]I don't even know.
[181:09.49]I got turned around.
[181:10.19]This is just like a funhouse.
[181:18.72]I don't want to be in the funhouse.
[181:22.73]What do I need to do?
[181:24.07]Where are the four kings?
[181:31.31]Oh, no.
[181:31.87]Not more of this.
[181:35.32]I guess I'm going to go this way.
[181:37.66]If I were to take a wild guess.
[181:42.40]I don't like this on the ledges.
[181:43.98]Oh, my fucking...
[181:49.38]Fuck.
[181:49.60]I can't see anything!
[182:30.44]I should have cut his head off right there.
[182:31.92]Bullshit.
[182:36.40]Oh my god, you have so many friends.
[182:40.79]Oh my god, you have way too many friends.
[182:42.31]What's with all the fucking friends?
[182:46.67]There's like seven people here now.
[182:50.94]He died.
[182:51.34]Somebody died.
[182:53.44]Go this way.
[182:59.87]I'm so lost.
[183:01.03]Oh my god, it's a fucking giant goddamn maze.
[183:08.05]It's a giant maze.
[183:10.21]It's a giant maze.
[183:15.00]It's a maze.
[183:17.96]Who is this?
[183:24.38]I did it.
[183:24.58]So one of the kings is my friend now.
[183:26.88]What is that?
[183:27.68]What are we doing?
[183:53.49]What happened here?
[183:55.53]They're just like spouting off random whispers.
[183:59.76]Do I leave now?
[184:25.14]What are you fucking people doing?
[184:33.69]I thought that... Do I kill these people?
[184:44.72]Everyone's dying now.
[184:48.24]Who is this guy?
[184:54.52]Has anybody figured out what's going on?
[184:57.88]I think these guys are bad guys, but I'm afraid because they won't attack me.
[185:01.72]Okay, they're bad.
[185:05.48]Got it.
[185:16.07]They're just brainless.
[185:17.99]Easy.
[185:19.25]Easy game.
[185:20.21]Easy money.
[185:21.43]We're good.
[185:22.81]We win.
[185:32.34]Are we done?
[185:33.60]No, there's one more guy.
[185:36.82]No, there's two more guys.
[185:37.72]One more hit.
[185:46.70]See you later.
[185:49.23]Well, now see you later.
[185:50.61]Alright, see you later.
[185:53.05]SEE YOU LATER.
[185:54.03]Objective done.
[186:02.10]Nothing wrong with this game.
[186:07.76]So that was one of the kings.
[186:10.03]I got one of the king's favor or something, right?
[186:15.81]There wasn't much for me to say there, guys.
[186:17.13]I'm sorry.
[186:17.51]I didn't really have much to say.
[186:18.63]There's a bunch of people fucking wiggling around.
[186:22.55]What the hell am I supposed to say about that?
[186:29.62]Another guy.
[186:30.06]Another guy just standing around.
[186:31.36]I don't know who these people are.
[186:33.86]There's a guy behind me.
[186:40.75]Did I like screw up the game?
[186:45.08]wrong with this game I did something that I wasn't supposed to I think is it when I spawned the giant should I should I not have spawned that giant like an hour and a half ago this looks like I can break it but apparently not okay I can break it but what did that do it didn't do anything
[187:17.76]try to go up there he's dead you can ro you see what I'm talking about like where the did this guy even come from look at this look at the spot okay I got stuck here that guy climbed up this to come get me
[187:48.02]Why are we doing yay and nay right now?
[187:53.46]Okay, we can't do that.
[187:54.40]I'm going.
[187:55.78]We got three more kings to deal with.
[187:57.26]Apparently there's another king in here.
[188:11.25]High Priest Lamontian.
[188:12.39]May he always walk in the light.
[188:20.61]Can I move him?
[188:21.81]I don't think I can move him.
[188:24.29]I can press the button, though, whatever that does.
[188:27.95]Oh, it closes me in.
[188:35.78]Okay.
[188:44.35]Rope bow.
[188:45.57]God, you guys are right.
[188:46.69]It really is a rope bow, isn't it?
[188:52.92]Can't fucking believe it.
[188:58.60]For what?
[188:59.04]I mean, there's a spot to go over there.
[189:04.47]It's the rope-o every time.
[189:12.47]It really is, isn't it?
[189:20.93]Just use the rope bow.
[189:22.47]That's not going to be long enough.
[189:23.61]I'm going to Donkey Kong it.
[189:32.39]Donkey Kong.
[189:33.15]Let's go.
[189:33.57]I'll find the right way eventually.
[189:52.72]Where the hell am I going?
[189:54.24]I mean there's like a chest over there or something.
[190:06.31]I tried to jump but it didn't work.
[190:22.33]Where the hell am I even going?
[190:23.35]Put the fucking inventory away!
[190:47.08]I'm so confused.
[190:51.95]I think I'm going the right way.
[190:57.91]Did you guys see what I was talking about with like shit?
[190:59.63]Is that a guy on my team?
[191:01.67]Shit just blended in together.
[191:02.91]I might be in the right spot but there's no way for me to tell right now.
[191:10.36]This is just like in the bottom of the pit somewhere.
[191:12.52]There's like a fucking alien symbol.
[191:18.69]Is that guy on my team?
[191:25.62]I put the wrong sword on.
[191:30.33]How did I put this on?
[191:32.47]How did I get this on?
[191:34.79]How did this get on?
[191:37.41]Why is that one on?
[191:38.85]It should be this one.
[191:42.89]Double kill.
[191:44.33]Nice.
[191:48.80]And everything is pitch black.
[191:55.29]This game was really fun when the whole game wasn't black.
[192:01.18]The first three areas where you could see a fucking goddamn thing.
[192:04.86]That sure was fun, wasn't it?
[192:17.49]Excuse me.
[192:18.37]What?
[192:19.03]What are we talking about?
[192:22.87]Apparently we're going this way.
[192:31.12]Back out here.
[192:31.84]There's a way to go down.
[192:38.19]Holy shit.
[192:41.33]We got three more kings to deal with?
[192:43.91]Where the fuck did you come from?
[192:46.85]Where did she come from?
[193:00.95]Did I just accidentally find the right way to go?
[193:02.75]I just did it.
[193:33.96]Whoa!
[193:34.28]I thought he was giant!
[193:41.44]I thought that guy was giant.
[193:49.83]Where is she?
[193:52.05]Where did she go?
[193:54.59]Where did that girl go?
[193:55.43]Are they fighting the Archmage?
[194:09.00]I think they're fighting the mage.
[194:11.56]I would assume.
[194:12.52]Did they win?
[194:16.66]I don't know.
[194:17.12]I think they may have won.
[194:19.20]Not yet.
[194:40.54]What the fuck is that?
[194:42.43]What is this thing that's like a giant like wyvern?
[194:44.65]People that are just coming to the stream right now are probably just saying what the fuck is going on.
[194:54.00]Can't move out of the way please.
[194:58.60]He's just stuck.
[195:06.27]Guys, she's died.
[195:07.19]She died already.
[195:08.57]She's already dead.
[195:10.92]Her health is at zero.
[195:15.66]This is like walking through a Disney World ride.
[195:23.14]I got this!
[195:32.08]Not enough mana to cast the spell.
[195:42.16]Okay.
[195:43.44]Well.
[195:45.60]Let's, uh, let's... Oh, shit.
[195:49.96]Hold on.
[195:50.36]Every... Every quicksave is, like, with the fucking monsters?
[196:05.29]Okay.
[196:07.63]We're good.
[196:11.67]Let's go.
[196:20.60]Not good.
[196:23.94]Alright.
[196:25.40]Let's beat the game.
[196:27.50]Dark Messiah.
[196:28.49]Elder Scrolls.
[196:29.69]This is not an Elder Scrolls game.
[196:31.25]I don't know why I thought it was.
[196:38.67]That was the worst guard you've ever hired.
[196:40.45]Holy shit.
[196:41.79]Here we go.
[196:43.21]Welcome back, teleporting lady.
[196:43.89]Why is she sneaking around?
[196:44.85]He can see us already.
[197:07.92]Get over here.
[197:09.08]You fucking dumb bitch.
[197:13.14]Give me the skull.
[197:16.86]Watch out, he turned invisible.
[197:22.19]Oh, that hurts.
[197:24.79]Wasn't there a wyvern?
[197:29.53]Should I be, like, doing magic on him, too?
[197:38.21]Interesting grunt you got there buddy.
[198:05.92]Come here, you fucking jerk.
[198:08.00]Come here, jerk.
[198:13.66]Alright, now he's doing the thing that he was doing before.
[198:21.88]Quest saved.
[198:22.18]Here comes the wyvern.
[198:23.25]Make him a tiny fucking wyvern.
[198:25.11]Watch this one.
[198:36.55]I'm going to weaken that wyvern.
[198:39.38]Where is he?
[198:39.84]There he is.
[198:41.98]He looks like different.
[198:43.44]Wait a minute.
[198:44.36]This is freaking me out.
[198:47.62]Hold on.
[198:48.04]Rope up.
[198:48.32]Watch this one.
[199:06.57]Watch this one, guys.
[199:07.99]Come here.
[199:08.57]Give it to me.
[199:09.27]Get it.
[199:09.55]Where is he?
[199:10.11]Where is he?
[199:11.37]Here we go.
[199:11.85]Ready?
[199:35.93]What was my plan here?
[199:37.03]Oh, this.
[199:47.94]Here we go.
[199:49.40]This one is for... Kalimdor!
[199:54.48]Oh no, I'm gonna die.
[200:01.91]I don't even- I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
[200:03.33]Here it is for Kalimdor!
[200:08.83]Whatever.
[200:09.59]I tried.
[200:09.89]I'm gonna shrink him and shoot him with one thing.
[200:13.64]This is kinda goofy.
[200:14.90]Where's my friend?
[200:45.19]Lightning, I'm gonna put on lightning and like the fire.
[200:48.03]Let's try lightning.
[200:51.98]I don't know.
[200:56.20]I don't think that's hitting him.
[201:00.46]Okay.
[201:08.33]Just pointing to him.
[201:22.14]What the fuck was that?
[201:23.72]What just happened?
[201:24.76]What the?
[201:26.44]Alright, I... That's when you can attack him, I guess.
[201:32.85]Oddly enough.
[201:41.69]They're all just homing this.
[201:42.65]They all missed.
[201:45.79]Here we go.
[201:55.92]Okay, I get it.
[201:56.70]That's how you do it.
[201:58.24]Fun.
[201:58.46]Now we're gonna shrink him.
[202:01.20]I'm gonna shrink him and then step on his head.
[202:11.09]I gotta get the shrink.
[202:14.51]Shrink, step on his head.
[202:15.85]I gotta get it ready.
[202:28.89]Fucking stupid ass menu.
[202:36.09]Come on, disappear so I can shrink him.
[202:37.81]Come on, disappear.
[202:40.55]Fine, shrink this guy then.
[202:45.47]Can I shrink him and step on him?
[202:50.79]He's not close enough.
[202:55.05]No, I can't.
[202:55.64]I don't think I can shrink anybody here.
[202:57.84]So just shoot the fireballs and then I'm going to cut his fucking head off.
[203:07.76]Weaken.
[203:10.75]Didn't work.
[203:24.17]This is... Alright, I'm done with this.
[203:29.65]I'm done.
[203:30.71]It was fun.
[203:31.63]I'm done though.
[203:32.35]Thanks for playing.
[203:34.17]I win.
[203:52.22]Give me a skull and end the game!
[203:53.36]What, I just put it- I put it back.
[203:57.08]I thought I was done.
[203:59.70]Okay, give me the skull.
[204:21.71]Hold on, wait.
[204:27.17]Ten centuries shall the fortress stand.
[204:30.80]Walls of spirit wrapped in balls of fire.
[204:33.98]What happened?
[204:34.82]What happened?
[204:35.60]Did I win?
[204:38.02]I put it back.
[204:39.36]This is the opening cutscene.
[204:44.17]One century of blood and...
[204:50.66]Wait, go back.
[204:51.42]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[204:53.21]We need to... That was the opening cutscene.
[204:58.21]I have it in my hands.
[204:59.23]Let's do it.
[205:16.34]Yes father!
[205:16.72]Oh come on!
[205:17.18]Why can I not make a bad decision at the end of the game?
[205:43.94]Okay, so what happens if I don't bring the skull?
[205:45.91]That ending was terrible.
[205:47.75]I want the fucking weird ending.
[205:49.19]I want the good ending.
[205:57.86]Bring it to me, my son.
[205:59.08]Yes, my son, my heir.
[206:01.72]Yes, my son, my heir.
[206:03.28]Bring the skull.
[206:04.90]Shatter the...
[206:12.28]Ten centuries shall the fortress die.
[206:15.86]Walls of spirit wrapped in walls of fire.
[206:26.37]The game crashed.
[206:28.63]That's it.
[206:35.42]MM.exe has stopped working.
[206:46.93]Hey, wasn't that fun?
[206:50.37]Watch the ending on YouTube.
[206:53.53]So, alright, let me get this straight.
[206:55.39]I'm very curious about something.
[206:58.57]So the opening cutscene to this game is the ending cutscene to the game.
[207:04.23]If I'm correct here.
[207:04.99]Let's watch the opening cutscene.
[207:08.73]Here's the opening cutscene.
[207:09.81]Ten centuries shall the fortress stand.
[207:13.02]Walls of spirit wrapped in walls of fire.
[207:17.14]and Hornet Lord shall bow their heads to one not yet born of the darkest side one century of blood and strife the moon shall darken and none know why the resting place at last is found of the seventh who soared so high okay alright is it opening cutscene?
[207:51.11]Alright, so let's watch the other one.
[207:55.18]Let's do the bad ending.
[207:56.64]Hopefully the game doesn't crash again.
[208:14.03]We would have seen it if the game didn't crash.
[208:15.47]You guys are talking about my fault.
[208:18.45]This is my fault apparently?
[208:19.59]The game fucking broke?
[208:26.36]Alright, here we go.
[208:28.86]We're gonna do the good and bad.
[208:29.84]It is my fault.
[208:30.70]We're gonna see the other one.
[208:46.72]One century of blood and strife.
[208:49.32]Ten.
[208:50.08]The moon shall darken and none know why.
[208:53.68]The resting place at last is found of the seventh who saw it survive.
[208:59.55]Alright, let's see what happens.
[209:01.45]At last.
[209:03.13]Come to me, my son and savior.
[209:06.71]Samus, no!
[209:07.51]What are you doing?
[209:12.36]Get her.
[209:14.98]Get rid of her.
[209:17.16]Transformers villain.
[209:19.63]I did the same thing to her earlier, and they got mad at me.
[209:24.53]I raised my arms, and for the first time in centuries, no chains bind them.
[209:46.51]From darkness comes the light of flame.
[209:49.98]The demon lord by his hand was freed.
[209:53.74]Sovereigns both, they claimed the world as Sar Shazar had prophesied.
[209:59.53]This is the end of the game.
[210:03.47]Okay, cool.
[210:05.09]So the world ends.
[210:06.39]Okay.
[210:06.51]Let's go ahead and take a look at the good ending.
[210:16.62]Good end.
[210:16.92]Here we go.
[210:17.40]Good end.
[210:17.82]This is the happy ending.
[210:20.12]So what's the good part?
[210:35.82]Rope bow ending?
[210:37.18]Did she still die the same way?
[210:40.48]It's the same animations by the way.
[210:43.28]Same exact cutscene.
[211:02.16]They just re-dubbed it.
[211:03.44]Same scene.
[211:06.83]They just re-dubbed it.
[211:11.69]Oh, God.
[211:14.49]They did.
[211:14.85]They just re-dubbed the fucker and added some blue filters.
[211:18.39]Betrayer!
[211:19.85]I shall hunt you!
[211:21.07]What a coward you are!
[211:22.70]You and your pretty friend!
[211:27.41]Remember that I am ancient and patient.
[211:32.43]One day I will be free.
[211:34.61]And I will teach you the full venture of agony.
[211:42.05]From greed or fear, you will decide.
[211:45.25]The chained one is left alone.
[211:48.51]The relic's power yet untapped.
[211:51.95]And Ashan's fate still yet unknown.
[211:56.69]Well, there we go.
[212:01.89]Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is done.
[212:06.33]But we're not done with the stream.
[212:09.19]Not done with the stream yet.
[212:10.65]Not yet.
[212:13.98]And I say that because how many of you fucking guys have this game still on PC?
[212:19.70]Because there's a multiplayer on Steam.
[212:28.40]Does that still exist?
[212:33.87]Whoever just can jump into a random server.
[212:36.11]Do they still have servers?
[212:37.99]Just play it?
[212:39.17]Who knows how bad it is.
[212:40.29]Just give me a second.
[212:43.00]Let me just take a look at it.
[212:49.84]But there's the single player, Doug.
[212:53.11]I don't know if I'm going to do more than a couple rounds on this, if it even works.
[212:56.33]Let me just make sure it works first.
[212:58.22]So give me one second, guys.
[213:00.44]Because the service might not even work.
[213:03.16]So give me a minute.
[213:10.35]Let's just take a look-see.
[213:13.31]Because it's a separate game.
[213:18.11]And it's a completely separate video as well.
[213:22.43]This is like a completely different game.
[213:24.03]Everything looks weird.
[213:27.59]Streamer beat Might and Magic on stream.
[213:29.61]Yeah.
[213:30.57]You bet your ass I did.
[213:34.47]That's fine.
[213:35.23]Let's turn the audio down.
[213:38.57]Okay.
[213:40.13]That's good.
[213:42.33]My name is just player.
[213:44.67]Let's see.
[213:48.23]Find servers.
[213:52.19]There are no servers for Might and Magic Online.
[214:00.59]Yeah.
[214:01.83]Unfortunately.
[214:02.53]Unfortunately, there are no Might and Magic servers.
[214:08.34]Vanilla Prime.
[214:10.30]We can't set one up either.
[214:11.74]Not right this second.
[214:17.20]So, sorry, guys.
[214:21.46]There are no servers of Might and Magic.
[214:24.28]I cannot host a server.
[214:25.48]I'm behind like firewalls and shit.
[214:28.96]Like it's not going to work.
[214:32.29]It is from 2006.
[214:32.67]That is true.
[214:35.23]Well, we tried.
[214:39.45]And that's going to conclude the stream then.
[214:41.75]Unfortunately.
[214:45.44]10 proxies?
[214:46.30]No.
[214:46.56]I just like it.
[214:47.50]This is like 2006 shit.
[214:51.39]Probably for the best Minecraft it is.
[214:54.68]No, we'll be going for just about three and a half, four.
