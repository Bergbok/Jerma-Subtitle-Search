[00:08.56]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.15]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.13]And tonight, I'm going to be playing as the spy with the default setup.
[00:18.18]Completely default.
[00:19.60]It's a short gameplay, but this is going to be a pretty short video.
[00:22.44]I want to just address something that's going to be happening this weekend.
[00:25.38]Something I'm going to be a part of, and you should too.
[00:28.71]And what that thing is, is the Tip of the Hats charity event is going on Saturday starting tomorrow.
[00:36.17]Today, I'm recording this video on Friday, and it's going up on Friday afternoon or Friday night.
[00:41.09]So if you see this video like next Sunday, then I'm referring to this weekend, the 29th, starting the 29th.
[00:49.27]The charity is going to be the One Step Camp, which is a charity.
[00:53.53]It's an organization that is designed to help young kids with cancer go to camp and have a good camp experience.
[01:00.96]It was started by some doctor in some oncologist in Chicago, and it's a pretty good charity.
[01:06.12]So I'm glad that we're benefiting that.
[01:07.84]Glad we can help out some of these kids.
[01:09.80]And it's all starting 12 p.m.
[01:13.45]Eastern Time, or 4 p.m.
[01:15.39]GMT is when it's starting on the 29th, Saturday, tomorrow.
[01:19.55]I'm gonna be there.
[01:20.33]I'll be there for at least some of the events.
[01:22.21]I'm gonna try to pop in as much as I can.
[01:24.27]I'll be in the chat for a while.
[01:25.83]You'll probably see me at some point this weekend.
[01:27.95]It's all getting streamed.
[01:30.09]It'll be on Twitch.
[01:31.34]It's going to be going from Saturday until late Sunday.
[01:34.62]So if you think, oh, well, it's tomorrow afternoon.
[01:36.74]I don't have time.
[01:37.34]I'm not going to be able to make it.
[01:38.52]You can jump in at any time during this weekend and join in on the festivities.
[01:42.65]That's the great part about this.
[01:43.81]You don't have to... It's not like a one-hour thing.
[01:46.13]This is going to be going the entire weekend.
[01:48.87]And on that stream, there's gonna be some pretty interesting stuff going on.
[01:52.86]First of all, there's gonna be some pretty high-level jumpers and surfers.
[01:56.72]I remember last year, I was just mesmerized at some of the crazy shit these guys could do.
[02:02.08]And that alone is worth going and watching.
[02:04.10]I'm not exactly sure when that... The schedule is on the website, which the links will be in the description.
[02:08.67]But besides that, there's gonna be competitive matches that are gonna get streamed.
[02:11.81]There's gonna be pubs.
[02:13.03]There's gonna be random little events, random cool little things.
[02:15.61]It's gonna be a really awesome event.
[02:16.85]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:18.31]So I recommend you show up there.
[02:19.84]All the links, all the relative links will be in the description for you to check them out when this all goes live tomorrow.
[02:26.60]And again, if you're watching this tomorrow, then get over here.
[02:29.86]We're like having fun, raising money for some kids.
[02:31.84]What are you doing?
[02:33.33]And last year they raised somewhere around $35,000 in like two days.
[02:39.01]So that's just remarkable to me that this community is capable of something that amazing.
[02:43.85]And I really hope we either match that or even surpass it this year.
[02:48.58]We'd be making a whole lot of kids happy.
[02:50.74]And that's the most important thing of this whole weekend.
[02:54.88]So with that, I'm going to wrap up the video.
[02:56.46]Just a quick little shout of what I'm going to be doing this weekend.
[02:59.41]And I'll see you guys there.
[03:00.43]I'll see you guys next time.
[03:01.47]And of course, take care, everybody.
