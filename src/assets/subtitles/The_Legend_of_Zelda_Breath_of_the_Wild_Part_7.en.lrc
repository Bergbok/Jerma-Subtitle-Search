[00:06.30]I know, I know.
[00:07.16]I'm like, yeah.
[00:08.90]Is it really late anymore?
[00:11.30]Should we really call it late anymore?
[00:12.64]Or should we just call it normal?
[00:15.88]It's just normal.
[00:24.51]He's tired?
[00:28.49]He's tired.
[00:30.23]He sounds sick.
[00:31.01]Yeah, because I kind of am still.
[00:40.47]I got COVID the first week of November, and it's like, some days I just feel fine, and then some days I'm just like, oh, my throat hurts again.
[00:49.55]I'm negative for COVID, though.
[00:51.07]I think my body's just still kind of getting over it.
[00:53.70]This is not abnormal for me.
[00:56.74]Whenever I get sick, whether it's cold, flu, any illness that's going to cause me to cough, sneeze, or have a sore throat,
[01:09.30]This shit always takes a long time for me to get over it.
[01:12.02]It always kind of lingers for at least a few weeks.
[01:18.90]But yeah.
[01:20.48]Still kind of getting over it.
[01:25.03]Milk and cheese voice.
[01:26.21]I haven't had any today.
[01:33.09]Oatmeal voice.
[01:33.89]I haven't heard that one.
[01:35.81]But there's a lot to talk about.
[01:39.23]There's an unbelievable amount of things we have to go over.
[01:42.73]So, in my smooth radio voice, I think I'll tell you.
[01:46.63]Uh, hold on a minute.
[01:53.87]Hold on.
[01:56.83]Okay.
[01:58.82]So, I'm gonna just wait a second.
[02:00.12]I'm gonna wait for people to trickle in, like we usually do.
[02:02.46]Let's chill for a minute.
[02:07.62]Are you dreaming right now?
[02:10.13]I don't think so.
[02:11.05]Because that would mean I'm dreaming right now.
[02:17.51]So, if you're dreaming and you're typing here, that means I have to be dreaming.
[02:22.49]Because I would see you write that.
[02:24.53]I would have to be asleep.
[02:28.48]There's no way we're both dreaming.
[02:36.18]You're an astral projection.
[02:40.13]weird that's not how that works well I don't okay but I saw it in my chat so if you're dreaming typing that that means that I'm I have to be asleep too and it's my dream not yours because I would be seeing that over here yeah it's my dream not yours let's stop talking about your dream you know when I hear my dream
[03:10.93]But way too dank.
[03:13.66]Just me talking.
[03:14.38]Am I loud?
[03:15.64]I'm a loud person, I think.
[03:17.02]That's why I try to like shut up sometimes.
[03:20.18]If I ever get like really excited, I'll be like, oh, I can't wait.
[03:24.69]I'm very conscious about how loud I can get.
[03:39.26]Who do you think is going to win the World Cup?
[03:45.82]I don't I don't I don't know.
[03:48.76]That's football, right?
[03:51.12]Soccer.
[03:53.38]I'm just going to pick.
[03:54.14]I'm going to say.
[04:01.71]What teams even playing is every team like in the world, right?
[04:09.21]I don't know who's got the good team this year.
[04:11.23]I guess I'm just going to jump on that bandwagon.
[04:15.03]Hey, who has the good team this year?
[04:16.97]Somebody said TSM.
[04:20.85]Can you imagine?
[04:21.51]Oh, dude, I think Cloud9 Brazil is going to get it.
[04:33.75]Alright, who's the team that everyone thinks is cool and everyone's waiting for them to play?
[04:39.00]Let's go.
[04:39.46]It's definitely Scotland.
[04:46.08]No, Argentina.
[04:49.96]Mexico.
[04:50.30]Does Mexico have a team?
[04:52.50]Does Mexico have a team this year?
[04:54.02]What do you mean this year?
[04:54.92]Why am I saying that?
[04:55.97]Is Mexico in it?
[04:58.17]Alright, let's go.
[05:00.29]Mexico.
[05:01.65]All the way.
[05:07.52]They're going to go all the way.
[05:13.53]At least top five.
[05:14.34]I don't know how it works, but they're going to be at least top five.
[05:33.27]Where's your Mexico shirt?
[05:34.43]I don't know.
[05:35.07]It's gone forever.
[05:36.57]I don't know where it is.
[05:37.67]I loved that shirt.
[05:41.05]It fit me so well.
[05:42.56]I thought the... That was one of my favorite shirts and it's just gone.
[05:46.54]I don't know what happened to it.
[06:12.44]no sponsor there is a sponsor today but not till later so today we have Breath of the Wild we're going to be jumping into as well as after two or three hours we're going to hop over to multiverses season two is out for multiverses
[06:32.58]And Warner Brothers has sponsored the stream.
[06:35.36]So I'm like, yeah, let's go.
[06:36.92]Warner Brothers has been very good to this channel.
[06:41.66]And I think multiverses is fun.
[06:43.26]So we're going to try it.
[06:44.68]There's some new characters that I haven't played.
[06:51.85]What platforms is multiverses on?
[06:53.79]Well, we'll get to that.
[06:56.51]We'll get to that.
[06:57.05]Because I'm not so sure either.
[06:59.43]I'll have to figure that out.
[07:06.23]Are you a happy boy?
[07:07.05]Yeah, I've been okay.
[07:07.97]I've been very busy, but... Alright, so you guys ready?
[07:10.85]It's been a few minutes.
[07:17.13]Let's talk.
[07:17.59]Number one.
[07:22.30]The end of the year awards are upon us.
[07:27.80]This weekend, we're going to open up nominations for the end of the year awards.
[07:35.10]You will be able to nominate for two weeks.
[07:39.12]After two weeks, we're going to collect all the information, we're going to collect all the data.
[07:46.03]There will be a voting period for about two weeks.
[07:50.79]And if all goes according to plan, the show will not be on New Year's Eve this year.
[07:58.34]It will be part of a Christmas extravaganza.
[08:08.31]So there's going to be a big holiday stream this year.
[08:11.52]Hoping, planning, trying to get there.
[08:18.35]And it will be part of that stream.
[08:24.45]So that's the plan.
[08:25.48]I, but don't want to talk too much about it because it's not, we're not quite guaranteed.
[08:33.34]We're pretty much guaranteed, but I don't want to announce it too hard yet.
[08:37.64]But the plan is, but regardless, there's going to be an end of the year awards like there is every year.
[08:42.50]In the Discord, a channel will open with just like we've done in previous years.
[08:47.75]Will Battle Axe be before this?
[08:50.45]That is a great question.
[08:55.27]There is.
[08:58.07]There is a chance that the Battle Act stream might happen.
[09:02.84]Like maybe even in the same week as the holiday stream.
[09:08.22]There's a lot going on.
[09:12.35]If not, then the Battle Act stream will be like in the first or second week of January.
[09:20.89]Still trying to figure it out.
[09:27.05]They will happen.
[09:28.49]These two streams are going to happen within 30 days of each other.
[09:40.78]But alright, are you guys ready?
[09:41.76]We're going to do some Breath of the Wild.
[09:44.56]Chill out for a little bit.
[09:46.42]And then from there we're going to go into Multiversus.
[09:49.85]Which should be fun.
[09:58.51]Why do you hate being an old man?
[09:59.95]What?
[10:01.83]Why do you hate being an old man?
[10:03.69]Sims 4 is going to come back next week.
[10:05.01]So here's the plan.
[10:07.09]Oh, okay.
[10:07.79]No, I'm going to wait to talk about this.
[10:09.83]Until maybe a little bit, like after an hour, we'll talk about it.
[10:14.13]So... This weekend, be on the lookout for the Nominations channel, and I will talk about it again when we stream again.
[10:24.66]You know, I want to just say it more than a few times.
[10:27.42]GrottoBeasts.net if you haven't already and you want to be able to be notified and be ready when that goes on sale.
[10:36.99]I would go to GrottoBeasts.net right now.
[10:41.41]And sign up.
[10:43.77]We're trying to gauge again how many units we should really be prepared for.
[10:51.18]That's important because that's close.
[10:53.40]That's very close.
[10:59.96]I think the excitement levels are starting to rise on that a little bit.
[11:03.79]Because it's very, very close to being starting.
[11:09.87]Is it an NFT?
[11:11.95]No, it's not.
[11:13.23]It's physical cards.
[11:15.49]You already knew that, though.
[11:17.25]And you know what?
[11:18.22]I'm upset with you.
[11:19.70]You already knew that.
[11:25.06]What is this?
[11:25.74]Pinned chat.
[11:26.56]We can pin chat now.
[11:27.92]Oh, shit.
[11:28.40]Look at that.
[11:30.12]What?
[11:37.77]It works every time.
[11:38.67]Yeah, it does.
[11:38.99]Alright, you guys ready?
[11:39.99]We're gonna play Breath of the Wild.
[11:43.10]And then we're going to move to multiverses.
[11:44.92]And then I'll give you the schedule for this coming next couple of days.
[11:48.26]I want to get the end of the year award stuff situated this weekend.
[11:53.00]We'll be back on Monday with probably some more Sims 4.
[11:56.81]We have to keep continuing that McNulty arc.
[12:02.93]And then maybe like Tuesday or Wednesday of that week.
[12:05.03]Depending on how far we get in the McNulty arc.
[12:12.39]We'll see how that goes.
[12:16.49]Alright, here we go.
[12:18.35]Let's play Breath of the Wild.
[12:19.75]It's going to be a chill session, you know what I mean?
[12:21.93]We're just chilling today.
[12:23.11]I feel like the streams have been a little unhinged the last few days.
[12:28.53]So we're just going to relax and just go shrine hunting.
[12:32.42]You know what I mean?
[12:33.34]It's been a little wild.
[12:35.94]So I think we need a breather here.
[12:42.18]It's always unhinged.
[12:45.26]Somebody just said, do you want us to be serious?
[12:50.32]Uh-oh.
[12:52.42]Oh shit, I took too long.
[12:54.16]My switch turned off.
[12:58.06]But yeah, lots of fun things happening.
[13:00.28]Battleaxe stream is being worked on.
[13:02.28]Christmas stream is being worked on.
[13:04.12]Grotto Beasts is coming.
[13:05.41]End of the year awards are happening.
[13:07.83]There's a lot going on.
[13:14.22]What happened to my screen?
[13:17.11]Oh, it's not plugged in.
[13:19.45]Oh, shit.
[13:20.37]Hold on.
[13:21.85]Wait one sec.
[13:23.79]Not plugged in.
[13:28.90]I was wondering.
[13:33.60]Back here?
[13:34.46]Yep.
[13:35.10]Reach back here.
[13:59.38]Come on.
[14:02.94]I'm gonna talk about this.
[14:04.60]I've forgotten to talk about this like a dozen times.
[14:09.92]We gotta talk about this, it's so important actually.
[14:17.36]Okay, so do you guys also, does it also make you a little angry?
[14:25.79]Come on, I gotta make sure my fucking notifications are up.
[14:30.66]uh so every monitor always has all the inputs underneath tucked in in a weird spot does that annoy anybody else that like you have to like lean down and stick your head up and like pull your arms around I just wish they were somewhere simple like on the side or something you know what I mean I know I know people are gonna go dude your cable management would be stupid you wouldn't be able to have monitors next but I mean I feel like some of these are just so tucked in and so hard to reach
[15:02.17]I feel like this has to be a better solution than like tucked into a cave behind your monitor.
[15:10.41]You're right.
[15:10.89]OK, I thought people were going to think I was crazy for this.
[15:15.29]Alright, let me just go to here.
[15:17.53]No, I don't want parental control zone.
[15:38.58]Okay, there we go.
[15:43.07]What if I turn for... Can you turn parental controls on for yourself accidentally?
[15:46.87]No, you can't, right?
[15:55.96]You can?
[15:56.48]Okay, that's weird.
[16:01.00]Alright, let's go.
[16:06.92]You guys should be able to see it now.
[16:14.05]back into uh Breath of the Wild ready to play you going to McDonald's oh sick alright the last thing that I did kind of loud isn't it maybe not it's a little loud for me
[16:38.34]I just beat the second Guardian.
[16:39.90]So now what the heck do I do?
[16:41.12]I was going to say the F4, but I didn't want to say... Okay.
[16:51.05]Let's see, where are we going?
[16:54.87]So I just did all this.
[16:55.95]I did Goron City.
[16:57.17]I did the Beast.
[16:58.15]It was sick.
[17:01.09]Why do I have all this marked?
[17:05.12]Alright, look at this entire area over here that I have not even looked at.
[17:09.52]Where should I go now?
[17:12.46]Go south.
[17:15.93]Go south.
[17:16.47]Go west?
[17:18.81]West of the volcano.
[17:21.03]You mean like... Like this way?
[17:23.91]Like over here?
[17:25.77]Go south.
[17:26.43]Go south.
[17:27.45]You know, I've seen a lot of South Andes.
[17:29.72]And I think I'm gonna listen.
[17:30.80]So you mean like down here?
[17:31.66]Down here?
[17:32.94]Down here?
[17:35.01]Down here?
[17:37.16]West.
[17:38.20]Like, southwest.
[17:39.14]Like, right here.
[17:39.60]This sounds like a pretty good place to go, right?
[17:44.40]Alright, let's go.
[17:44.82]Let me get in a tower.
[17:50.05]Let's make it happen.
[17:57.67]Move your cam.
[17:59.37]Oh, that's right.
[17:59.77]I'm blocking some stuff.
[18:00.84]Aren't I?
[18:04.24]What are your thoughts of the death of Twitter?
[18:07.02]You know, I was thinking about... I was thinking about just releasing every one of my drafts.
[18:20.34]Just like, guys, I'm releasing the drafts.
[18:25.17]And just take a bunch of screenshots of like 30 tweets.
[18:30.31]And just put them as images next to each other.
[18:37.54]Do it.
[18:37.90]Release the drafts.
[18:40.54]I'm gonna unclassify the tweets.
[18:46.21]Why is the camera in a weird spot?
[18:47.21]Hold on.
[18:51.21]Yeah, I'm a little too far forward.
[18:52.35]Okay, there we go.
[18:53.29]Alright, so you're saying, so from here, let's do, uh... I'm gonna go this way.
[18:58.06]Let me take a look and see if there's any shrines, because that's the title.
[19:04.12]Got that one.
[19:07.33]Got that one.
[19:07.93]Alright.
[19:08.23]Looks like over there... Wait, no, that's not southwest though.
[19:10.73]Everyone's gonna be screaming at me.
[19:12.20]It's this way.
[19:18.24]What's this cathedral?
[19:19.02]Have I been in there?
[19:19.68]No, that's where I found the guy, right?
[19:21.78]Alright, I'm going this way and I'm gonna get that tower.
[19:27.10]That's the plan.
[19:27.66]And I'm gonna teleport there.
[19:36.01]You're the guy?
[19:38.94]I don't know what I'm the guy of, but I don't know.
[19:41.46]You may have found me.
[19:42.20]I might be the guy.
[19:50.29]How the heck is everybody doing today?
[19:58.19]Already cold.
[20:00.86]What are those?
[20:02.64]Oh, shit.
[20:03.02]Alright, hold on.
[20:04.04]So, I don't want to go that way.
[20:05.30]I want to turn around and I want to... Where's the tower?
[20:09.90]Over there.
[20:10.44]I don't have any cold gear.
[20:13.76]Sorry, I'll be out of the cold area in a second.
[20:16.48]Oh my god, hopefully I just didn't die.
[20:20.84]This is definitely not cold over here, right?
[20:27.12]Is it cold up here?
[20:29.60]Trying?
[20:35.86]No, let me get the tower first.
[20:37.54]That's priority number one.
[20:45.89]That's absolute priority number one.
[20:48.13]That hurt?
[20:48.97]Oh, I fell from actually kind of, kind of far.
[20:55.85]Yeah, it's not cold over here.
[21:03.20]This is the Elden Ring area.
[21:06.42]Don't say what, hey!
[21:08.06]Alright, hey, do you guys think that Elden Ring's DLC is going to get announced?
[21:15.67]in the next like month when do you think it's gonna happen I'm so ready I hope I hope it's but I hope it's ready and I hope it's good don't BatChest Elden Ring it's like one of the best games ever made don't please I was actually thinking about game of the year right because like oh the game of the year right when it's come it's coming up and I was trying to make my top five or top three and I can definitely say elden rings number one
[21:44.75]But also... Are we Batchesting Elden Ring?
[21:48.84]Have we got... We have not gotten there, right?
[21:52.96]We've gotten to the point where you Batchest... It's like become Marvel?
[21:56.90]Like if I say Spider-Man, for instance.
[21:59.86]Everyone's gonna go, Spider-Man, Batchest, haha.
[22:02.00]That wasn't like that like five years ago.
[22:03.72]Ten years ago.
[22:05.39]Have we gotten to the point where FromSoftware now gets the Batchest treatment?
[22:10.95]It can't be, right?
[22:16.50]No, I don't agree with that one.
[22:18.84]I don't agree with that one.
[22:19.70]I think you guys are wrong.
[22:21.56]What's this?
[22:22.58]Pump it up, brother.
[22:24.04]This is our ancestral training ground.
[22:26.72]Us three Goron blood brothers are in the midst of a contest of endurance.
[22:31.66]Feel the burn, brother.
[22:33.42]We're trying to become strong and powerful Gorons.
[22:35.91]Right now, we're competing to beat the heat.
[22:39.47]So sweaty.
[22:40.11]We're Gorons, but the heat is too much for us these days.
[22:48.02]Jeremiah, what are you talking about?
[22:53.28]It's too hot to handle in Goron City, so we came here to train ourselves.
[22:57.64]I have an idea.
[22:58.82]Come join us.
[23:00.37]Yeah, come try the Contest of Endurance.
[23:03.77]Okay.
[23:05.85]A guy like you has a burning passion in his belly.
[23:08.77]It's inspiring.
[23:10.49]Alright.
[23:15.88]When you already step up onto the platform, then the Contest of Endurance will come up.
[23:18.73]Do I have to, like, take the heat or something?
[23:20.05]Like, burn?
[23:20.47]Do I have to, like, get burnt or something?
[23:26.22]Everybody bat-bat-chesting Elden Ring.
[23:30.66]I can't believe it.
[23:34.16]Why?
[23:34.38]Did somebody make a post on like the Elden Ring Reddit or something that's like, oh man, you have to have a really high IQ to understand the story of Elden Ring.
[23:41.51]You know, like America and all this shit.
[23:44.24]It's like, did that happen?
[23:45.28]Did that happen?
[23:46.22]And now everybody is giving it like Rick and Morty treatment.
[23:55.93]I don't believe it.
[23:57.37]You guys are full of shit.
[23:58.27]I know it.
[23:59.63]Okay, if you leave the ring or pass out, it's over.
[24:02.61]Prepare yourself for the contest of endurance.
[24:10.36]The air has become very hot.
[24:11.50]Okay, so what?
[24:16.59]Am I allowed to heal?
[24:17.95]Or do I just have to... Do I have to do fighting?
[24:21.57]Alright, condense the body.
[24:25.57]Make the center of your body together.
[24:29.21]Breathe deeply, but not fast.
[24:31.79]Deeply, but not heavily.
[24:36.38]Slow breaths.
[24:38.66]Condense your body.
[24:45.37]That was fucking easy.
[24:54.77]You're amazing.
[24:55.49]Is it because of the clothes I had?
[25:00.09]Okay.
[25:01.20]I'm granting you the highest honor, the chance to participate in the contest of ultimate... Oh, that was just a joke.
[25:08.16]Okay.
[25:09.32]Toughest test known to Goron kind.
[25:12.77]You see the ring behind me, the one surrounded in fire.
[25:14.67]Do you feel it in your gut?
[25:15.65]What a bad idea it is to go there.
[25:17.84]Your gut is dead on.
[25:20.08]That special training area is even harder than the last one.
[25:22.86]This contest won't just challenge you with heat, but also with fire.
[25:27.06]If you lose your focus, your body will catch fire.
[25:29.38]Make sure you're prepared for this.
[25:30.30]It's said that passing this test will reveal a shrine.
[25:34.26]Fuck, I hate being on camera.
[25:46.96]Is that heat-resistant gear you have there, brother?
[25:48.86]A real Goron man shouldn't have to rely on wussy stuff like that.
[25:54.88]Goron up and take the challenge with... Uh-oh.
[25:57.32]Okay.
[26:00.08]So I can't wear heat-resistant gear.
[26:01.78]So... Alright.
[26:05.86]Let me get... Let me figure this out.
[26:10.16]So... Can I drink a heat-resistant potion or something?
[26:13.89]Or is that... Is that illegal too?
[26:18.07]Do I even have heat-resistant stuff?
[26:21.35]If I drink this, will it- will I get- will it be mad?
[26:26.35]This is technically- it's technically- it's cheating.
[26:30.65]Okay.
[26:34.25]You're gonna dope- doping the fire contest.
[26:39.39]Try it.
[26:39.75]I don't want to try it, because this is- this is good stuff.
[26:43.21]Let me see if I can handle it without that.
[26:45.09]So let me heal.
[26:47.74]Um, I need to make some new food.
[26:49.80]I gotta go on, like, a food run.
[26:50.88]Because I want to have at least full hearts for this.
[26:55.81]Uh-oh.
[26:57.47]I might be in trouble here.
[26:59.23]I'm just gonna go... Can I just find stuff to eat on the ground?
[27:09.47]Like, can I just pick up rocks and, like, eat, like, the dirt on the ground and shit?
[27:12.17]Like, can I just eat the dirt?
[27:13.03]Okay.
[27:15.73]There's gotta be just random shit I can find on the ground, right?
[27:17.51]I'll be right back.
[27:22.33]I gotta mark this, because I'll lose where this is.
[27:27.66]Fucking bring it to Congress, I swear to God.
[27:32.42]Bring it to... A is B, B is A. Bring it... I swear to God.
[27:37.65]No, it's right here.
[27:50.38]Okay, I need to find something to eat.
[27:51.82]Is this a track?
[27:57.18]Oh, I thought this was like, um... Thunder Mountain from Disney.
[28:01.00]I was about to get really excited.
[28:02.60]Do you have food?
[28:05.14]I know, but it has benefits and I don't want to eat it.
[28:07.84]Oh, whatever.
[28:08.24]I'll just eat something.
[28:08.84]Who cares?
[28:13.89]Equip an ice weapon.
[28:21.89]Will that help?
[28:28.08]Why would I walk into that?
[28:30.68]No, I'm taking this off.
[28:31.66]Because I don't trust anybody here.
[28:33.90]I'll just wear... Oh, you have the torch.
[28:35.52]Alright, so I'm gonna just eat whatever.
[28:38.06]It doesn't matter.
[28:40.20]I can get it back.
[28:42.42]Yeah, whatever.
[28:43.59]Just drink it.
[28:44.05]Alright, I'm ready.

[30:12.47]I win.
[30:21.55]So epic.
[30:22.54]What a powerful display.

[30:32.50]Oh no, it's a shrine!

[30:34.60]Oh, that's so cool.
[30:47.37]Well, that's a shrine or some such.
[30:49.63]Really appeared just like that.

[31:03.71]Alright, well, alright, cool.
[31:07.37]So this is the shrine.
[31:08.21]Of course, the title says it's a shrine.
[31:10.03]I do need to heal, though.
[31:12.53]I should probably put the fire gear back on, right?
[31:18.21]Yeah!
[31:18.69]Alright, I need to eat something, because this is bad.
[31:27.54]I'm just going to eat the movement speed shit.

[32:29.22]Jerma, please.
[32:29.74]The shrine will heal you.
[32:32.14]I don't know what this shrine is.
[32:33.34]What is it?
[32:34.34]It might be a combat shrine.
[32:38.21]Reload to get... I thought this could... They could be combat shrines.
[32:41.65]This is not... Was it not a combat shrine?
[32:43.39]You know that I don't.
[32:45.81]I told you I wasn't going to get upset today.
[32:47.63]And I'm already getting there.
[32:50.06]How am I supposed to know there's not going to be a combat shrine?
[32:52.64]Okay.
[32:56.10]No, no betting.
[32:56.70]Because I don't want people to lose money.

[33:32.32]I stopped playing chess and started just playing checkers.
[33:36.47]Everyone gives me shit when I play this game about that.
[33:38.47]I'm just playing checkers.
[33:40.01]That's it.
[33:41.45]Don't play chess.
[34:02.96]Fucking do it.
[34:42.21]Fuck.

[36:10.38]Thank you
[36:51.43]I got it.
[36:51.99]I got it.
[36:52.35]It's right there.
[36:54.83]It's literally right there.
[36:56.24]I just have to be... I have way more time than I think I do.
[37:23.15]What?
[37:24.67]Why did it stop?
[37:30.42]That's not fair.
[37:35.44]You can't give me the Zelda You Did It music and then take it away from me.
[37:46.31]So what?
[37:48.09]How do I keep this up then?
[38:07.30]What if I do this?
[38:10.20]That just turns it off.
[38:12.24]That doesn't do anything for me.
[38:13.11]What did you think was going to happen, Jeremy?
[38:25.03]Okay.
[38:25.81]Somebody asked us like an hour ago.
[38:27.01]They said, what are you drinking?
[38:29.20]Green tea?
[38:30.30]Energy formula?
[38:32.96]That's really good.
[38:33.68]Okay.
[38:33.80]Okay.
[38:37.17]Did I have it right?
[38:39.85]Is there a second one of these that I just didn't see that's behind me or something?
[38:42.77]I have to freeze that in midair.
[39:05.08]Stop!
[39:05.60]Whoa, why?
[39:06.50]Never mind.
[39:08.50]Alright, so what's going on here?
[39:12.12]You have to keep it up.
[39:15.24]And I think it has to be quick.
[39:17.44]No, there's no way.
[39:18.40]How do you do this?
[39:23.13]Or just like go stand on it?
[39:26.45]Oh my god, that was so easy.
[39:27.53]Oops.
[39:37.85]Rook, Bishop, to E, two.
[39:42.73]Queen, to B, 11.
[39:46.72]King, F, six.
[39:55.64]I'm on the wrong board.
[39:56.66]What am I doing?
[40:04.39]I just had to stand, whatever.
[40:07.47]Alright, let's take a look at this one.
[40:10.29]So, imagine you have to put out the fires.
[40:19.77]No, you have to... Alright.
[40:21.19]Oh, shit.
[40:21.91]Okay, so I have to make... I have to light them on fire with that torch.
[40:27.92]Which, where even is it?
[40:30.54]Why is it not lighting?
[40:32.30]Oh, man.
[40:32.88]This is going to be awful.
[40:34.48]Okay, so I have to turn the water off.
[40:38.76]on each side while I... No.
[40:44.02]I'm sorry.
[40:45.24]I'm just gonna fucking light the torch on fire and shoot arrows at it.
[40:53.40]Oh boy.
[41:04.77]Oh man.
[41:05.67]Okay.
[41:07.39]What does this do?
[41:12.33]Oh!
[41:12.89]Alright, so... Oh, God.
[41:21.17]There's gotta be a th- I- maybe I can put one of those, uh, things on it?
[41:31.12]Can I light my shit on fire?
[41:36.29]I don't think I can light it on fire with anything.
[41:42.82]Can I?
[41:43.14]Let me see.
[41:56.66]This is not even fire!
[41:57.60]This is fake restaurant fire!
[42:00.54]These are fake restaurant candles!
[42:02.18]This is not real fire!
[42:13.76]Okay.
[42:16.28]So, now that I can't do that... Wait, is there a... I can't even leave.
[42:21.89]I'm glad nobody could bet that I was going to do this in seven minutes.
[42:26.53]Alright, let's just do it the way that I was going to do it.
[42:28.19]And I'm going to... Just... Okay, we need to turn this off for a second.
[42:33.28]Okay.
[42:45.06]Oh, shit.
[42:45.56]I'm close.
[42:46.00]I only need the... Okay, hold on a minute.
[42:50.32]I just have to get two.
[42:52.12]One on the left, one on the right.
[42:54.29]And I think I know what to do here.
[42:56.45]I need to lower the one down here.
[42:58.31]Freeze it.
[43:02.33]And... Oh, man.
[43:07.48]I think... I don't know.
[43:11.59]I think I, okay, let me try this.
[43:16.15]Stupid!
[43:17.21]Sorry.
[43:43.63]Why would you crouch?
[43:56.83]Oh, fuck.
[43:57.25]There's only one more.
[43:59.23]How's that?
[44:18.70]No!
[44:20.35]I don't get it.
[44:21.13]I don't understand.
[44:34.65]Wait a minute.
[45:16.01]I can't reach that.
[45:19.49]I can't reach it.
[45:23.17]No, it's definitely that you have to click on this and then freeze this and go up there and then freeze that one and then turn it and use the magnetic thing.
[45:30.83]It's a bunch of bullshit.
[45:31.81]It's just a bunch of horse shit.
[45:32.79]It really is.
[45:33.81]Okay, so I need to freeze this and then magnetize.
[45:39.65]I don't know.
[45:40.19]Can I magnetize?
[45:40.95]Can I spin this without?
[45:43.68]No, I can't.
[45:47.13]Okay, please tell me.
[45:48.31]Is this bait?
[45:50.67]Is this right here?
[45:51.77]Is this bait?
[45:52.37]Or do I need to use this?
[45:53.77]Is this bait?
[45:57.75]No.
[45:59.83]Christmas tree.
[46:00.79]Give me some help.
[46:02.23]Christmas tree.

[46:16.92]I have no idea.
[46:19.00]Okay, football.
[46:24.70]Well, I can spin it like this and get all the ones here.
[46:26.96]Okay, so I just have to worry about the ones on the left and right.
[46:31.83]And if I put the one... If I freeze this one and I try to light the one on the left, the one on the right is going to put out the thing that's on the right.
[46:40.99]So I have to freeze the one on the right and turn and then...
[46:47.89]I don't know.
[46:48.69]Here we go.
[47:03.46]I wish I could hand this controller to one of you right now.
[47:05.75]I wish I could just hand it to you.
[47:07.97]Like, I would hand it to you, and I would just sit back and just bite my fingernails while you did it.
[47:14.75]song Santa mallet okay that hurt song sing a song with Santa mallet so many people keep saying magnet magnet magnet but I don't know what I would magnetize because the what is that what do I magnetize here that's this is the only thing I can magnetize like hold this down or something
[47:48.44]Oh shit.
[47:50.66]Oh!

[47:54.40]Alright, I figured it out.
[47:55.24]I got it.
[47:56.81]What does it have to do with Santa?
[48:08.57]Ooh!
[48:12.36]Inventory's full.
[48:13.28]What do I have?
[48:13.80]Bullshit.
[48:14.98]I can just get rid of the torch.
[48:22.27]Alright, I got it now.
[48:26.47]Cool.
[48:27.89]Okay.
[48:29.13]I don't... Now it's easy.
[48:31.11]Now I just freeze that.
[48:32.53]Okay.
[48:33.29]I was going to say, this is so confusing.
[48:37.08]There it is.
[48:41.56]And there it is.
[48:43.72]And there it is.
[48:45.74]There it is.
[48:46.44]God damn it.
[48:52.84]There it is.
[48:55.65]Light this!
[48:58.69]What if I... Light it!
[49:18.26]I was gonna say, give me a break.
[49:29.41]Wait.
[49:30.76]What about that chest?
[49:40.82]Where was that chest?
[49:43.62]Oh.
[49:43.78]Can I not get it anymore?
[49:48.24]You got the chest.
[49:50.44]No, there was this chest.
[49:52.14]Wasn't there?
[49:52.48]Wasn't there just one sitting back here?
[49:57.80]You can freeze things, Omega Stupid.
[50:01.16]I have not heard Omega Stupid before.
[50:06.46]Omega Stupid.
[50:08.96]Hey, you can freeze things, Omega Stupid.
[50:15.42]Alright, so how many do I have?
[50:20.86]I will tell you because you can't alley.
[50:22.04]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, just one.
[50:24.94]Omega Stupid.
[50:31.24]That meant freeze.
[50:34.65]I don't know, man.
[50:36.23]People were doing presents, Santa, mallet.
[50:41.05]To me, that does not mean freeze.
[50:43.59]That means when Santa comes to deliver the presents, hit him over the head like Tom and Jerry.
[50:50.36]What does that mean?
[50:52.08]Oh, the treasure chest.
[50:53.62]Okay, I'm thinking like Santa comes to get the presents.
[50:55.74]What's the mallet then?
[51:04.39]The mallet.
[51:09.01]No fucking clue what the mallet was.
[51:11.17]Yeah, I don't understand what the mallet is.
[51:13.13]The mallets would freak me out.
[51:14.49]If you didn't have the mallet there, maybe I would have understood that.
[51:16.79]But to me, it's like, hey, get ready.
[51:18.11]Hit Santa with this mallet.
[51:19.99]Alright, cool.
[51:23.11]That was fun.
[51:25.93]Okay, so now... Oh, right, the tower.
[51:29.01]Here it is.
[51:31.07]Huh?
[51:33.01]Huh?
[51:41.56]D-Gen stream.
[51:44.33]What the hell?
[51:44.77]How is this a D-Gen stream?
[51:52.69]Open this box.
[51:53.55]What's that?
[51:54.01]I thought I just kicked it off a cliff.
[51:59.57]Ooh, a wild berry.
[52:00.69]Alright, I gotta take a picture of that. ...
[52:19.88]Got it.
[52:20.70]Okay, because now I can search for these if I want to.
[52:32.91]Um, climb please?
[52:41.26]Jesus!
[52:41.94]I swear I was trying my hardest to get that.
[52:50.80]I was really trying.
[52:51.90]Okay.
[53:08.42]Almost there.
[53:08.96]Any more shrines up here?
[53:21.85]It's actually not even hot.
[53:22.59]I can take off the hot gear.
[53:24.06]Oh wait, hold on.
[53:24.96]I gotta be ready for this.
[53:27.08]Yeah, I'm gonna take the hot gear off.
[53:28.06]I don't need it.
[53:28.41]I want more defense.
[53:31.29]You know what I mean?
[53:52.36]God damn it.
[53:53.60]Sorry, I can still do it.
[54:26.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[54:32.44]Why are these not exploding?
[54:54.29]Sorry, I just, like, screamed.
[54:57.41]What's that?
[54:58.83]Ooh, it's a boomerang.
[55:01.37]I can't carry anymore.
[55:02.35]I'd be out of breath by the time I got here.
[55:23.62]That's going to be the most menacing thing I've ever seen.
[55:26.94]Can you imagine you have to shoot somebody with a bow and arrow and they have a big weapon in their hand and they are sprinting side to side and they're getting closer and closer.
[55:34.73]That would be so horrible.
[55:38.23]It's like your aim has to be true or that's it.
[55:48.76]Alright, what's that boomerang over here?
[55:58.06]Okay, there it is.
[55:59.34]Cool.
[56:00.36]This thing does a lot of damage.
[56:01.16]Do I have any shitty weapons to get rid of?
[56:05.14]This is 36 damage.
[56:05.86]That's pretty good.
[56:09.32]Nah, I get everything I got.
[56:10.81]It's good.
[56:11.77]Anything terrible that I can just use right now?
[56:13.57]Nah, all these... Okay.
[56:18.57]The boomerang looks cool.
[56:19.37]Yeah, it does.
[56:25.34]My stomach's killing me.
[56:26.96]Just take it easy.
[56:30.80]You know what helps me?
[56:32.30]Ginger tea.
[56:32.82]I'm telling you.
[56:36.44]Inventory's full.
[56:40.16]Didn't want to do that, but it's alright.
[56:41.52]Alright, so I need to see what... I've held on to this frenic bow forever, and people just keep telling me.
[56:55.39]Should I even have this?
[56:57.98]You should just get rid of it.
[56:58.76]Throw it away.
[56:59.43]Get rid of it.
[57:00.63]No, BatChest.
[57:01.35]Keep it.
[57:06.33]What's so special about this?
[57:07.37]I don't know.
[57:10.85]I want the higher damage.
[57:22.84]It has higher zoom.
[57:23.76]If I don't need the zoom, my aim is pretty good.
[57:29.12]His aim is good.
[57:30.94]Okay, where's the... There's a longer shot.
[57:41.67]I don't even...
[57:54.14]I don't want to fight you.
[57:59.70]Dogs can't climb.
[58:00.74]This is high up.
[58:19.80]Ladder.
[58:32.76]You have to shoot explosives with fire arrows.
[58:35.66]I guess that makes sense.
[58:38.28]But I'm still upset about it.
[58:39.24]Alright, so what's over here?
[58:45.33]I have a really itchy eyebrow.
[58:49.33]Oh, that means there's a ghost in the room.
[58:54.77]Is your face really itchy today?
[58:56.35]Oh, that means a ghost is talking about you.
[58:57.65]Alright.
[58:59.02]Alright.
[59:06.05]What's this for?
[59:20.70]No, dude, it's just dandruff.
[59:27.27]Scratching my head and dandruff's just falling on my shoulders.
[59:30.87]I'm like dandruff, clearly dandruff.
[59:33.14]Oh man, a ghost.
[59:35.14]Your itchy head means like somebody's talking about you.
[59:37.22]Dude, no.
[59:44.07]No, what is it?
[59:44.51]It's sneezing.
[59:46.37]Somebody help me here.
[59:47.47]It's like, oh, if you sneeze, it means somebody's talking about you.
[59:50.85]It's something stupid.
[59:52.65]What is it?
[59:56.16]Somebody please help me.
[59:59.16]Something with ears.
[60:00.08]Your ears itching or something, right?
[60:11.92]Your ears are warm.
[60:15.81]What?
[60:17.09]It's itchy nose.
[60:18.73]No, I was close.
[60:19.57]Yeah, I had it correct.
[60:20.85]Itchy nose, your ears are itchy, that kind of shit.
[60:24.29]Yeah, I had it right.
[60:26.75]I mean, maybe a little bit.
[60:28.63]But whatever.
[60:33.23]It is sneezing.
[60:33.90]There's a bunch of... There's a lot of them.
[60:36.56]What is this?
[60:37.36]I'm gonna have to take a picture of that.
[60:41.04]Yeah.
[60:51.20]It's having hiccups.
[60:56.33]Did we just kind of try to find ways to make it so people are talking about us?
[60:59.19]That's why everyone seems to be saying something completely different.
[61:04.49]Like, oh!
[61:06.41]Oh, these people are talking about me.
[61:08.50]Oof.
[61:09.08]Itchy nose.
[61:10.02]There's a ghost in the room.
[61:11.14]Like, no, your face just hurts.
[61:13.38]Or itches today.
[61:14.28]What?
[61:16.72]Oh, dude, you ate that Big Mac a little too fast.
[61:19.94]Yeah, we're talking about it right now.
[61:21.44]You ate it way too quickly and it was fucking weird.
[61:33.93]Oh, it was perfect actually.
[61:35.74]Was it?
[61:36.02]I don't know.
[61:39.86]Why is he electrocuted?
[61:41.02]Flurry rush.
[62:06.91]This is a weird camera angle.
[62:08.69]Am I controlling the guy?
[62:09.85]I'm fighting Link right now.
[62:11.55]This is very strange.
[62:13.49]Okay.
[62:15.11]Which way?
[62:15.53]Left or right?
[62:21.65]Get out of the way!
[62:22.65]Change the camera!
[62:30.97]Boomerang!
[62:31.77]Is it gone?
[62:34.50]Way to go!
[62:35.04]What?
[62:47.95]What are you doing?
[62:48.67]I was trying to get it to fly back at me.
[62:50.31]What?
[62:56.32]Alright, we're good.
[63:03.26]There's a night shield, broadsword.
[63:16.29]Lot of items here.
[63:17.09]Lot of goodies.
[63:21.48]Ow.
[63:25.46]This thing's about to break, so I'll just keep using it.
[63:26.88]Alright, there's still these electricity monsters.
[63:36.08]Somebody's talking?
[63:39.28]Do you prefer the cold or the heat?
[63:44.82]um I I don't it's interesting because I kind of go I flip flop on it uh so I live in Las Vegas and you get extremes kind of both uh sometimes Vegas is like 115 degrees fahrenheit what did I just get during the summer
[64:09.25]And then it gets to be like 30 to 40 during December, January, February.
[64:14.23]There's a Topaz.
[64:15.99]Oh, cool.
[64:19.18]I bounce back and forth though because I love the heat.
[64:22.06]I love just a burning hot day where you just like the haze in the air and just like so hot out.
[64:26.84]Because as you guys know, this is important for you to understand the context behind this.
[64:31.66]I am, I, I, clothes, I like light fitting, comfortable clothes.
[64:39.32]Tank top, pair of shorts.
[64:41.54]T-shirt, pair of shorts.
[64:44.11]And I can just be the tank top shorts guy.
[64:48.05]Seven months out of the year.
[64:53.56]It's a big, big reason.
[65:03.22]You're that guy.
[65:09.77]All I'm saying, okay, you can, look, it's not like 80.
[65:15.50]You can call me that guy.
[65:17.18]It's not like 85.
[65:18.20]It's 120 degrees outside.
[65:19.90]You understand?
[65:20.76]It's not like, oh, it's like 90.
[65:22.08]No, it's 118 degrees Fahrenheit.
[65:24.06]You're a pool boy outfit.
[65:40.77]Oh shit, can I sneak up?
[65:44.12]Never mind, I don't care anymore.
[65:52.30]It's actually very nice in Vegas now.
[65:55.64]Sort of this September, October, November, the fall.
[65:59.16]It's a really, really nice kind of crisp cool 60 to 80, 60 to 70.
[66:06.60]It's nice and crisp outside.
[66:07.66]It's got that crispy fall scent.
[66:12.81]You can die in this.
[66:14.23]Okay.
[66:14.90]You know that crispy fall scent?
[66:17.62]Nice and kind of cool.
[66:19.14]Like 65.
[66:21.02]Breezy.
[66:25.44]I'm not, I don't, why would I fight?
[66:32.81]I have to just jump to this?
[66:35.05]Wait, what is all this shit?
[66:36.05]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[66:36.73]Alright, just fight.
[66:37.36]Just kill.
[66:40.28]Why is there so much shit everywhere?
[66:55.33]Moblin arm?
[66:57.47]Why is it coming back without a head?
[66:58.58]I thought you just had to get rid of the head.
[67:03.50]Why does this keep coming back?
[67:04.46]I got the head.
[67:04.98]I already killed the head.
[67:14.46]Where's he going?
[67:20.93]He just went into the water and died.
[67:23.03]Alright, that was weird.
[67:29.55]He was telling the other guy that I was here?
[67:36.98]Ooh, alright, I gotta take a picture of this.
[67:48.31]Your album is full?
[67:49.41]What do you mean my album is full?
[67:57.91]Let's look at them for a minute.
[68:00.00]That's pretty good.
[68:05.04]Why did I take these?
[68:05.92]I did not.
[68:08.04]I didn't take these.
[68:11.06]Did I take these?
[68:14.62]When did I take these pictures?
[68:16.46]I didn't take these.
[68:17.33]I did?
[68:18.23]I guess I... I remember... Okay, I remember taking... Okay, these are different when my pictures start.
[68:37.50]Yeah, I took this one.
[68:38.52]I definitely didn't take this one.
[69:04.90]Oh, right, I was trying to get a picture of this big dragon.
[69:09.42]Nice vacation photos.
[69:13.54]This really does remind me of vacation photos.
[69:17.25]Have you ever tried to take a picture of something like, oh, look, this, this, like, a parade went by.
[69:22.41]Or there's a thing on, like, a cool thing on a ride to take a picture of if you're allowed to take pictures.
[69:26.99]And this is what you end up with.
[69:29.68]And it's just like, I don't even know what this was.
[69:31.34]I guess it was something far away that I, it's kind of cool, I guess.
[69:35.27]It's a very bad photo.
[69:38.34]Your camera's delayed.
[69:40.10]Yeah, it should be.
[69:42.66]The mic is delayed too.
[69:47.40]Cam desync.
[69:48.60]What?
[69:49.30]Like right now?
[69:50.00]Why are you guys just noticing this now?
[70:00.65]It just got very desynced all of a sudden.
[70:05.60]What?
[70:15.22]One, two, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[70:26.59]What?
[70:32.10]It's actually fucked.
[70:33.60]What happened?
[70:35.25]I didn't... I mean, I've been sitting here just sitting here.
[70:38.87]Is this... This is a new thing from like the last five seconds.
[70:41.33]I don't know what happened.
[70:48.20]It just did it out of nowhere.
[70:50.14]The mic is faster.
[70:51.72]What?
[70:52.70]That should not be happening.
[70:54.90]I have it set... Hold on.
[70:57.08]Alright, so right now it should be really out of sync.
[71:03.15]Like, right now.
[71:04.04]It should be like, holy shit, this is unbearable.
[71:09.34]Right.
[71:09.76]Now... It should be matching now.
[71:20.45]This should be fine now.
[71:22.81]That's so weird.
[71:23.27]That doesn't make any sense.
[71:30.74]Now...
[71:33.94]What?
[71:42.60]Are we good now?
[71:49.63]Is it fixed?
[71:54.05]Stop gaslighting him.
[71:59.55]I'm so confused.
[72:01.41]Why would this happen?
[72:03.84]It's better now?
[72:04.30]Let's try it.
[72:05.60]One.
[72:06.60]Two.
[72:07.52]Three.
[72:08.52]Four.
[72:09.46]Five.
[72:09.80]I... I don't know what happened.
[72:12.66]I didn't touch any buttons that you saw.
[72:14.18]I've been playing.
[72:14.80]Alright, so I have to delete some shit.
[72:19.51]Okay, delete.
[72:26.97]Can I just select... Okay.
[72:29.55]No, I want to keep some of these.
[72:30.33]These are, like, sentimental.
[72:31.51]Definitely not these.
[72:33.55]Definitely that one I remember.
[72:35.55]This one's actually really sentimental.
[72:38.15]Because you could actually... This is when I was freaking out.
[72:45.36]It's still delayed?
[72:46.10]I don't fucking understand what's going on.
[72:52.95]This is pointing in the direction I need to go.
[73:03.08]And I was having a fucking meltdown about this.
[73:06.66]And this is like proving that what you guys are saying is fun.
[73:10.79]Refresh?
[73:11.27]That worked?
[73:12.15]Yeah, maybe refresh the stream.
[73:13.47]Because this should be no reason why that's happening.
[73:23.10]Why can't I take a picture of this?
[73:24.06]I guess I can't.
[73:28.28]Maybe I already did.
[73:28.86]Alright, let's do this.
[73:42.06]Alright, I get it.
[73:44.58]I get it.
[73:51.23]Why does your room look like you're in a Lowe's?
[73:58.05]Like the hardware store?
[74:12.02]It's just a gray background.
[74:13.87]Does this make any sense?
[74:21.52]Oh my fucking god.
[74:59.31]But I've made it?
[74:59.87]So you rendered on a different layer than the background.
[75:06.14]I'm fine.
[75:07.02]I got a better fucking idea.
[75:53.84]Why can't I jump on this?
[75:54.74]I'm going the other way.
[76:14.21]I'm just going the other way.
[76:14.85]I'm going to go the other way.
[76:20.26]Look what's over here.
[76:21.02]Look at all these.
[76:21.82]Why am I digging through the mud to get all here?
[76:26.08]Just put them all in here.
[76:28.09]Just put them all in here.
[76:29.15]Why am I doing that?
[76:30.47]Just jump them all in here.
[76:34.23]It's giving me a fresh supply.
[76:45.63]But why... I thought... Okay.
[76:49.31]What's the... Why would they put all these here?
[76:52.65]Tell me.
[76:53.27]Why these... What are these doing here?
[76:56.31]What are these doing here?
[76:59.51]Why are these everywhere?
[77:01.09]If we're not supposed to use them.
[77:02.57]It's just a giant red herring.
[77:06.13]Why?
[77:06.41]Why would you put them here?
[77:07.83]No!
[77:11.54]That was a fruit I could have eaten.
[77:12.92]Ugh.
[77:16.79]Say it!
[77:43.14]Stop yelling.
[77:44.24]Yeah, I did say I was going to chill today.
[77:45.44]You're right.
[77:47.12]You're right.
[77:47.42]I need to chill.
[77:50.48]Alright, so now I just have to grab this.
[77:53.70]Okay, there we go.
[77:56.50]Good.
[77:57.71]Now... I can just jump to this.
[78:02.57]There we go.
[78:03.49]Alright.
[78:03.85]Everything's fine.
[78:05.97]Everything's fine.
[78:09.79]Now I have to be careful that I'm not going to screw this part up.
[78:15.65]I don't know what happened.
[78:20.11]Alright, we're good.
[78:24.27]Bod Watchers skip three hours.
[78:27.33]Don't.
[78:33.44]Why do you always lean out of the frame to take your sip?
[78:35.42]That's weird.
[78:35.90]That's fucking strange behavior.
[78:37.66]I do what I'm going to do.
[78:38.40]You do what you're going to do.
[78:40.90]That's all there is to it.
[78:44.58]What is this?
[78:45.45]What is this emote?
[78:49.23]Omega stupid.
[78:50.19]Did someone just add that?
[79:06.26]I thought it was a gnome.
[79:17.63]What happened to my head?
[79:18.77]Oh, oh, I guess stupid.
[79:31.52]Alright, I got it.
[79:33.26]Yeah.
[79:38.35]We're quick.
[79:52.52]Finally.
[79:52.92]Grab the DLC.
[80:11.61]I think I have everything I bought the game.
[80:13.76]Like four years after it came out, so I'm imagining I have pretty much everything.
[80:22.79]Alright, this is like a sorcery map.
[80:27.29]There's one mansion over here.
[80:31.20]What is this?
[80:31.80]I mean, this is where we're going.
[80:35.36]This is where we're going.
[80:40.61]There's only one road.
[80:47.18]That's where we're gonna go.
[80:48.18]Are there no towns on the way or anything?
[80:51.26]We'll find out.
[80:52.68]I'm stamping it.
[80:55.20]Okay.
[80:55.94]Cool.
[80:56.22]What about shrines, though?
[80:57.08]Let's take a look.
[81:01.13]I see... I see a shrine.
[81:17.13]That wasn't a shrine, but there's one right next to it.
[81:18.67]I feel like he would puke from doing that.
[81:34.26]Your stomach would go up into your brain.
[81:37.92]Who's talk... Oh, they... I don't like the talking thing.
[81:41.52]It keeps freaking me out.
[81:46.57]Oh, what is this?
[81:52.90]Do you guys think he's gonna find Ganon's house?
[82:10.44]Like it's like a historical landmark or something?
[82:14.85]Oh, this is where Ganon lived.
[82:16.31]This is his house.
[82:19.18]Before he became an evil mastermind.
[82:23.28]With a small, quaint house in this little village.
[82:41.57]No, it's literally where he lives.
[82:42.93]Did you just spoil the whole game for me?
[82:44.82]If you did, then you're gonna get a permanent... Didn't say ban.
[82:52.78]But I'm thinking about it.
[82:54.84]Thinking of mulling it over in my head if you should permanently ban.
[83:01.07]For spoiling that shit for me.
[83:09.78]You'd bite your tongue.
[83:11.50]That would be like a... Is it true that you hate Elden Ring?
[83:36.81]Those of you that are saying that,
[83:40.00]be yelled at by me right now.
[83:44.82]No, that's Game of the Year.
[83:45.88]Oh, I forgot.
[83:46.46]I didn't even talk about it.
[83:47.64]We gotta talk about the rest of the Game of the Year stuff.
[83:51.46]Elden Ring.
[83:54.28]Guess what else is on that list?
[83:55.90]Huh?
[83:56.72]Guess what else is on that list?
[83:57.62]What's number two?
[83:58.90]Tell me.
[83:59.96]No, it's not God of War.
[84:01.38]I haven't played it.
[84:03.10]I'll tell you what it is.
[84:05.02]Go on.
[84:08.36]No, it's not SCORN.
[84:11.05]No?
[84:11.59]People are missing out on this here.
[84:13.93]I think people are forgetting what came out this year.
[84:17.46]That is, like, really cool.
[84:19.06]Really unique.
[84:20.34]Oh, they can't talk because it's emote only mode.
[84:23.18]Oh.
[84:23.96]Oops.
[84:27.74]We'll go back over this in a minute when you can speak.
[84:30.73]Okay, so this is... What do we do here?
[84:39.53]Easy.
[84:44.76]I thought everyone was just Omega lulling me and, like, bat-chesting me.
[84:47.72]I was like, why can't people talk about our games of the year?
[84:50.48]Okay, so this... I needed one of those balls.
[84:58.33]Which, I'm just going to take one of these.
[84:59.41]Never mind.
[85:07.57]No, we're not going to... Don't add Omega Mind.
[85:09.70]That's just...
[85:15.84]it's it's pretty funny but I don't know it's stupid one hit it's gonna be Indiana Jones or something we're gonna pull this off and then we're gonna get like attacked
[85:45.81]Don't tell me I didn't know what I was doing.
[86:07.00]Omega Mine.
[86:07.88]Have you guys even seen that movie?
[86:19.52]I want, okay, put a poll up.
[86:22.18]Have you seen Omega Mind?
[86:26.37]Have you seen that movie?
[86:28.65]I feel like most people here have not seen it.
[86:31.21]And they just sit there pretending that they've seen it.
[86:34.79]Can I get a key?
[86:43.48]Yeah, do a poll.
[86:44.10]Have you seen Omega Mind?
[86:50.50]I doubt it's more than 50%.
[86:52.34]No, it's not.
[86:54.60]There's no way.
[86:55.71]There's no way that it's that.
[86:59.15]There's no way it's 80 plus percent of you.
[87:01.77]Stop shooting me.
[87:07.11]Okay.
[87:08.11]I've had enough.
[87:20.20]Megamind 3D.
[87:23.04]80... Okay, so 81% of you have seen Megamind.
[87:30.19]Bullshit.
[87:32.43]You've seen two clips from it.
[87:36.75]You've seen two clips from it because you typed into YouTube penis music origins.
[87:45.43]Don't act like you watched the whole movie.
[87:55.32]The cam's desynced again?
[87:56.32]Dude, what is wrong with this fucking camera?
[88:04.54]Shit.
[88:08.28]Alright, so that's electrifying the water.
[88:13.07]Oh wait, I want to electrify the water.
[88:15.09]So what's going on with this thing?
[88:19.07]What's the problem here?
[88:25.64]How come it's electrifying the water?
[88:27.40]Look.
[88:39.27]What was that whole thing with... If there was batteries in the ocean or something, what was it?
[88:46.12]You can let them out because now they can't backseat.
[88:47.86]What?
[88:48.36]What was that whole thing?
[88:52.56]Where, if you put like a, okay, like how far away would you need to be if somebody put like a battery, like a car battery in the ocean or something?
[89:07.75]What was it?
[89:08.97]It was during Hitman, we talked about it.
[89:10.55]80% of you have not seen Megamind, I don't believe it.
[89:34.93]It's one of the worst popular kids movies?
[89:44.00]It's a kids movie?
[89:54.09]I thought it was just like a general audience movie.
[89:55.61]I don't think it was like a movie for kids.
[90:08.96]That's what a kids movie is.
[90:10.34]But not really.
[90:11.06]General audience equals kids.
[90:17.16]That's... Yeah, I guess that's true.
[90:20.22]I guess that's true.
[90:24.21]Alright, so let me get on the road.
[90:27.29]It's for everyone.
[90:28.01]E for everyone.
[90:33.02]Oh my god, I thought that was a huge monster.
[90:36.22]I thought this was actually like a big thing that I could go, holy shit, what's down here?
[90:39.96]This is the roof of this place.
[90:43.42]Game of the year.
[90:43.98]Okay, so let's talk about game of the year.
[90:47.15]I think that Vampire Survivors belongs there.
[90:53.51]Vampire Survivors.
[90:57.61]Is up there for Game of the Year.
[91:03.56]Yeah, that came out.
[91:07.30]Got any rush rooms?
[91:09.36]See, I'm tired.
[91:10.18]Tired of going normal speed.
[91:11.36]I just tried rush rooms when I was five years old.
[91:14.70]Can't think of it.
[91:15.26]I ate them every day without fail.
[91:18.58]Back in the day, I'd win every race I ran thanks to those things.
[91:21.84]But to 55 years later, now I can barely drag these bones off the ground without those rush rooms.
[91:28.35]But no matter how many I eat, I just keep thinking of Scooby-Doo.
[91:32.02]It just won't leave.
[91:33.64]I'm just too old to up the cliffs to pick up those rush rooms.
[91:36.60]Where they grow up.
[91:37.44]Scooby-Doo is such a funny character.
[91:44.05]I thought Scooby-Doo was dumb when I was younger, but a little bit later, going back and watching, it's just like, what a funny character.
[91:50.20]Oh, Raggy!
[91:53.12]It's such a strange character.
[92:00.16]I know, like, funny voice equals funny.
[92:02.25]Oh, yeah, he's got, like, a goofy voice, but I don't know, something about it's just funny.
[92:13.29]The cam is de-stuned.
[92:14.21]I wish I knew what the fuck was going on here.
[92:17.93]Let me try this.
[92:19.93]I'm going to have to reset this every so often.
[92:23.05]Right now, it should be... Hold on.
[92:29.88]I'm going to try something here.
[92:30.86]Bear with me.
[92:31.30]I have no fucking idea why this is happening.
[92:35.82]Wait one second.
[92:38.31]Yeah, Game of the Year.
[92:39.03]Vampire Survivors.
[92:41.08]Definitely.
[92:42.90]Elden Ring.
[92:44.54]Alright.
[93:03.36]Definitely Elden Ring.
[93:04.90]I'm just grasping for words right now.
[93:08.20]You know, Elden Ring.
[93:09.46]Definitely, um... Yeah, definitely Elden Ring.
[93:14.04]What?
[93:14.81]But what is... This camera is so bad.
[93:18.17]I actually am going to hook up a DSLR, by the way.
[93:22.83]This is the worst camera I've ever used.
[93:25.11]It really is.
[93:25.85]I don't even know what to do with this fucking thing.
[93:28.45]This thing sucks so bad.
[93:31.29]It's like not even funny.
[93:43.19]Why is the exposure going crazy?
[93:45.33]It's like trying to go light, dark.
[93:47.97]The exposure is moving in and out.
[93:49.59]It's raising and lowering.
[93:50.89]See?
[93:51.83]I have auto exposure turned off at the hardware level.
[93:59.87]This is the worst piece of equipment I've ever purchased.
[94:02.29]This is probably the worst streamer piece of equipment I've ever bought.
[94:16.34]Okay.
[94:16.74]Let me try this.
[94:18.62]Okay.
[94:23.12]Hi.
[94:26.90]Is that better?
[94:27.38]How about now?
[94:36.83]Tell me if it's still desynced.
[94:41.79]Jesus.
[94:44.94]Are we desynced?
[94:49.56]I think I just keep refreshing this auto exposure.
[94:51.74]This thing sucks.
[94:56.82]I'm hooking up a DSLR.
[94:58.58]And everyone's going to give me shit for it because I'm going to look weird for the first three or four days.
[95:12.02]I look like I'm on like fucking 16mm film right now.
[95:23.45]Alright, is that better?
[95:24.17]Am I desynced?
[95:31.88]It's better.
[95:34.66]It's a piece of shit.
[95:38.92]I'm gonna fucking break this thing in half when I get this DSLR set up.
[95:52.51]Okay.
[95:54.93]Uh, let's keep going.
[96:01.64]DSLR.
[96:02.20]Yeah, I'm gonna set it up.
[96:03.30]It's gonna look so much better.
[96:04.16]There we go.
[96:15.07]I'm gonna turn it on and people are gonna say Uncanny Valley Andy.
[96:18.73]He looks like a rare steak.
[96:19.87]Quiet.
[96:23.75]Quiet.
[96:25.60]Okay, so what was that mission?
[96:26.46]Something.
[96:27.34]Alright.
[96:35.62]Rush room, rush.
[96:38.38]He's offered to trade a diamond for 55 rush rooms.
[96:41.18]I'm not gonna do that.
[96:51.85]What are you using?
[96:52.39]I'm using a Logitech Brio.
[96:56.79]And in my opinion, this thing stinks.
[97:01.57]I'm just telling you my actual product opinion.
[97:03.53]I think this thing stinks.
[97:05.85]This thing stinks.
[97:08.98]That's it.
[97:09.62]That's my opinion of this product.
[97:11.32]I'm just giving my opinion of a product.
[97:13.16]This thing stinks.
[97:25.13]Okay, I need to make some food.
[97:26.99]Nice Amazon review.
[97:32.95]You have one star and then an all lowercase with no punctuation.
[97:37.51]This thing stinks.
[97:46.42]And it's just a wicked shitty iPhone picture of some guy holding it with old man hands.
[97:53.80]And the box is kind of torn.
[97:54.88]The cardboard of the box is torn up a little.
[97:57.32]And he's holding the whole thing in his hand.
[97:59.80]Zoomed in really close.
[98:03.25]It's always like a carpet.
[98:04.55]It's always like a brown carpet underneath this.
[98:07.95]Always.
[98:08.23]Okay.
[98:17.08]Hmm.
[98:20.73]You didn't think the monsters could have... No, they're fine.
[98:23.05]They'll be back any second now.
[98:23.95]If you happen to run into any of my friends on the road, please let them know that Sesame is waiting for them here.
[98:29.31]Okay.
[98:37.08]Bring this up.
[98:37.64]Look into this one.
[98:39.08]Dell UltraSharp webcam.
[98:41.34]Is it good?
[98:43.96]Is it good, or does that thing stink?
[98:49.68]What was that, uh, the critic, John Lovitz, that old animation?
[98:53.87]Where his thing was... It stinks!
[98:58.47]That was a show.
[99:07.40]No, I'm saving my rupees.
[99:08.92]This guy talks too much.
[99:13.52]I know.
[99:16.53]I know, I really do.
[99:19.71]Did we hear a song?
[99:23.99]It really is.
[99:24.93]People wonder why it takes me so long to get through anything.
[99:26.79]Because it's like 75% me just talking and not moving.
[99:31.73]And like 30% playing the game.
[99:36.81]Oh, yeah.
[99:37.80]His Elden Ring playthrough.
[99:39.02]What did that take him?
[99:39.98]Like 50 or 60 hours?
[99:40.50]No, 275.
[99:49.86]No, I got shit to do.
[99:54.52]What stinks is you're not grinding Modern Warfare 2 Warzone.
[99:59.89]Did you watch when I played Call of Duty a few months ago?
[100:04.35]You don't want me to do that.
[100:07.65]Okay, so cool.
[100:08.27]So now let's get on the road.
[100:09.87]Can I get the horse?
[100:11.49]This is not a horse outpost, is it?
[100:15.09]It is.
[100:15.53]Alright, I can get Frank too.
[100:31.14]This guy stinks.
[100:44.90]I'm weird with games, though.
[100:45.98]I really am.
[100:47.79]Same thing with TV shows.
[100:51.29]I... Like, when I'm streaming, we're just sitting here playing and I'm just streaming, whatever.
[100:55.53]But it takes me forever to do anything, even in my own time.
[101:00.38]So I will, oh, I'm going to watch a TV show.
[101:03.26]That sounds good.
[101:04.06]Episode one of Game of Thrones or whatever.
[101:06.80]It doesn't matter.
[101:09.42]And I'll be like, okay, let's go queue it up.
[101:13.88]There it is.
[101:14.34]It's time to watch the episode.
[101:15.30]But wait, I need to go to the bathroom.
[101:16.80]I'm going to go to the bathroom first.
[101:19.10]Okay.
[101:19.34]So I go to the bathroom.
[101:20.40]I go pee.
[101:22.04]Okay.
[101:22.38]That was cool.
[101:23.32]That was fun.
[101:23.78]But I want to like something to eat first too, because I have to be in like the perfect mood to sit here and watch this or do this.
[101:28.90]Okay.
[101:29.94]And then I'll make a snack.
[101:30.82]I'll get some food.
[101:31.88]I'll eat it.
[101:33.00]And then I'll be like, wait, there's no blanket here.
[101:35.16]Like, I need a blanket on my legs while I'm sitting.
[101:38.47]Okay, well, I have to go get the blanket.
[101:39.63]Is there, is there, is one clean?
[101:41.39]Well, I'll get a, maybe I'll freshen up in the dryer or something like that, right?
[101:43.75]It's like, it's like an hour before I sit down.
[101:46.83]And then I sit down, and it's time.
[101:49.27]Why won't I fucking leave?
[101:52.33]uh I sit down the show is about to start wait a minute wait a minute I'm not quite ready um let me take a shower first I'll take a shower and then I'm like clean I'm fed I have no there's no bladder right walk down the stairs
[102:30.21]Horses aren't, what do you mean horses aren't allowed?
[102:31.97]There's a stable right here.
[102:35.59]There's a stable here.
[102:37.95]It's right, it's literally the entrance to the stable is in this area.
[102:41.97]I can't... You need to get your shield up.
[102:53.59]How do I do that again?
[102:57.17]How do I do the shield thing again?
[103:00.15]It's like jump and then like left, uh... Z and A. It's hot.
[103:16.20]What were we just talking about?
[103:34.71]In the desert, alright.
[103:37.91]You're searching for Khaleesa, legendary treasure hunter.
[103:40.41]Then your search is over.
[103:41.15]You're looking at her.
[103:41.77]I've been in the game for over 20 years.
[103:43.85]When I set my sights on a treasure, you can be sure that I'll claim it.
[103:48.02]Okay, for a second I thought, it's cold, not hot.
[103:52.80]I thought I was really nervous.
[103:56.46]I thought I was like, holy shit.
[103:58.50]I thought I was like starstruck or something.
[104:03.18]It's cold?
[104:05.71]I don't have any cold armor.
[104:06.82]I have swim speed shit.
[104:12.30]I have cold drinks though, right?
[104:18.37]Okay, mid-level cold resistance.
[104:20.65]This one's for 11 minutes.
[104:26.10]Let's go.
[104:40.94]What's over there?
[104:44.65]Oh, it's the third Guardian.
[104:46.79]The octopus.
[104:52.73]The camel.
[104:59.80]We're not underwater.
[105:00.98]Why would it be underwater?
[105:21.29]That was kind of a long cutscene.
[105:24.17]Ow, fuck, why?
[105:25.31]Like, I think I got the point, like, after the first two shots.
[105:37.24]Nothing unusual here.
[105:38.26]Is Karakara Hazar?
[105:44.11]Gerudo Town is still a fair distance southwest of here.
[105:47.07]If you're headed there, you should consider resting a bit.
[105:49.74]Though you are a Vo, even if you make it to town, you won't be able to get in.
[105:55.08]All the same, the Divine Beast is kicking up a storm right now, so I don't recommend going to Gerudo Town.
[106:01.75]Why is that?
[106:03.81]Gerudo Town is to the southwest.
[106:05.33]It's the biggest town in the area.
[106:07.09]It's famous for trade and also for staying active and vibrant all night long.
[106:11.68]However, there is a law forbidding Bo males from entering the city.
[106:18.63]You don't know about the divine beast Va-Naboris?
[106:22.55]Supposedly, it's the guardian deity for Gerudo people, but it suddenly started acting up a while back.
[106:28.59]There's nothing we can do to stop it either.
[106:30.32]It's protected by a fierce sandstorm and intense lighting.
[106:34.88]Though it hasn't yet, it could easily head towards Gerudo Town or this oasis.
[106:39.48]I do my best to keep an eye out from here.
[106:42.41]Ah, I don't need any thanks.
[106:44.15]This is my job after all.
[106:46.43]The lighting, the lightning, whatever.
[106:47.71]The desert's hot?
[106:51.79]Wait, say that again.
[106:52.31]The desert's hot during the day.
[107:09.92]Oh.
[107:12.18]It's like Las Vegas.
[107:14.24]Alright, so let's go.
[107:17.46]Something here, though.
[107:19.22]Is it cold to go in here?
[107:29.02]Why would I wake somebody that's sleeping like that?
[107:33.10]What am I going to do?
[107:36.02]Good evening, though.
[107:36.56]I guess it's Sav Saba in Gerudo, isn't it?
[107:40.25]But before I say any more, have we met before?
[107:43.30]I came from Rito Village.
[107:45.20]Have I been to Rito Village?
[107:48.42]Far to the north of here.
[107:49.36]It's a modest village on the Tabantha frontier.
[107:51.98]I had a great plan, you know.
[107:53.96]I left Rito Village to try to earn some money out in the world.
[107:57.44]It's so incredibly hot here during the day.
[107:58.92]It's been tough to work up the wheel to go any further.
[108:00.92]I'd like to see what Gerudo Town looks like, even if I can't go inside.
[108:04.25]It's just so hot.
[108:06.21]I heard there's an elixir that can help beat the heat.
[108:09.41]It's made from insects with cooling effects and monster parts.
[108:13.15]They don't seem to be selling the elixir anywhere.
[108:15.71]I've heard insects with these cooling effects live in the cold parts of the Gerudo Highlands.
[108:21.33]But, well, the monsters there are rough.
[108:23.97]Not to say the least.
[108:25.17]So I'm not having a lot of success getting myself motivated.
[108:27.57]How do I pronounce it?
[108:34.42]Am I pronouncing it wrong?
[108:38.12]What do you got?
[108:40.40]What do you got?
[108:42.28]Definitely.
[108:44.74]Ooh.
[108:48.11]Summer wing butterfly.
[108:49.67]Its wings absorb the warmth of the sun.
[108:52.79]Cook it with monster parts to create an elixir that makes you feel warm.
[108:55.23]Ooh.
[108:55.49]I'll take all of them.
[108:59.16]And I'll take ten arrows.
[109:06.83]I'll take all of these too.
[109:10.25]I just spent my money on something.
[109:16.65]Scam likely.
[109:27.50]Whoa.
[109:29.14]Just lying on the ground.
[109:37.86]Okay.
[109:40.52]Oh, this is cool.
[109:42.37]I like this weapon.
[109:46.23]Alright, so I gotta just get my way into... Is it Gerudo?
[109:49.83]Gerudo?
[109:50.19]How am I saying it?
[109:55.66]Can you spell it out phonetically?
[109:56.96]Oops.
[110:06.20]Do...
[110:08.51]Ger... Ger... You don't... Everyone's saying it at the same time.
[110:18.24]Gerudo.
[110:20.54]Gerudo.
[110:21.38]Gerudo.
[110:22.60]What was I saying?
[110:23.18]Gerudo?
[110:24.70]Alright, Gerudo.
[110:25.72]I got it.
[110:29.86]Gerudo.
[110:32.06]Thank you.
[110:35.24]I don't need to do that.
[110:37.58]Gerudo.
[110:42.97]Oh, sorry.
[110:43.89]Uh, I want to buy?
[110:46.33]I only sell arrows.
[110:49.09]They're on the counter.
[110:49.81]Oh, wait.
[110:53.13]Oh, aren't allowed in Gerudo Town.
[110:57.33]Uh, what do you got?
[111:00.12]Oh, alright.
[111:02.20]What do I need here?
[111:02.86]Probably fire and ice arrows.
[111:08.10]I have 27 ice arrows, but probably fire arrows, right?
[111:15.87]Buy everything.
[111:20.13]What?
[111:20.35]It was 20 rupees for one?
[111:21.65]20 rupees for one.
[111:27.37]50 rupees for one.
[111:33.38]What?
[111:34.58]The guy outside sells these for like fucking five bucks.
[111:45.71]Or whatever.
[111:52.95]What was up here?
[112:06.36]Climb the roof.
[112:07.36]That's what I'm doing.
[112:16.39]Why did I do this?
[112:24.82]There's nothing.
[112:25.40]Wait.
[112:29.38]What am I looking for?
[112:32.98]Stop back seating.
[112:35.70]You just pissed somebody off.
[112:39.22]You just pissed somebody off.
[112:41.50]Somebody in the chat just was getting annoyed.
[112:51.65]Well, I'm just gonna go.
[112:52.33]What, are people trying to spoil?
[112:58.70]Hey, yeah, just get on the roof and wait there.
[113:05.56]Ooh, tower.
[113:06.26]Yep, I'm getting this.
[113:10.40]Here's the main mission right now.
[113:16.39]And there's a shrine.
[113:19.63]Sick.
[113:24.38]Where is it?
[113:34.73]Another arm.
[113:38.25]I don't want to take this stuff.
[113:39.21]It's not worth keeping.
[113:41.28]I don't need any of this shit.
[113:44.16]I don't need any of this crap.
[113:55.34]What?
[113:56.82]Oh, you electrocuted me.
[113:58.66]I get it.
[114:04.80]Oh my god.
[114:06.04]Stop.
[114:06.32]Don't touch.
[114:07.02]Die.
[114:19.41]What the hell?
[114:20.21]That sucked.
[114:31.96]This will add to the resistance, right?
[114:34.84]No, it just resets it.
[114:35.70]It's alright, whatever.
[114:40.08]Please don't say hell.
[114:41.18]My dad will ground me.
[114:47.51]I don't want to fight.
[114:58.18]Leave me alone.
[115:01.60]Oh, I thought that was a rock.
[115:02.93]Alright.
[115:03.57]Seriously, you just did so much damage.
[115:09.89]Okay, I gotta get to the shrine.
[115:11.37]Like, right now.
[115:12.53]Get away from me.
[115:18.47]Okay.
[115:22.21]I gotta make some more food, too, eventually here.
[115:27.83]Come on, where's the dunk dunk?
[115:29.55]Dunk dunk?
[115:30.49]Dunk dunk?
[115:32.17]Dunk dunk?
[115:32.89]Alright.
[115:38.14]Ooh.
[115:41.56]Good.
[115:43.40]Nice fucking Amber there.
[115:57.20]So there's gonna be a new category this year, like there usually is in the end of the year awards.
[116:04.43]And I don't know if it's even worth putting on, but like, Polly and I were talking about it.
[116:11.87]And it's worst fake overdoing Boston accent routine.
[116:18.35]And I'm like, are people even gonna be able to find that?
[116:27.44]And I don't even know if anyone would even be able to find anything like that.
[116:34.28]And that's as bad as the... Which, I'll be honest... That might be my favorite category ever.
[116:42.13]Of the last five straight years we've been doing it.
[116:44.51]That's, like, my favorite category.
[116:46.89]That's, like, one of my... That's my favorite thing.
[116:51.47]I... I love that so much.
[116:53.99]It would stay if I did it enough.
[116:55.35]I don't think I did it... I think I did it once this whole year.
[116:58.97]Or did I?
[116:59.61]I don't know.
[117:00.09]I don't even know if it can be a... Can it even be a category?
[117:08.82]You've done it like 12 times?
[117:10.30]I have not.
[117:11.13]No, I haven't.
[117:12.03]We got over it.
[117:18.89]We got over it.
[117:19.69]I know we did.
[117:22.77]Oh, fucking Starlight Kid.
[117:24.26]Oh my god, I have done that more than a few times, haven't I?
[117:35.10]Have I done that a lot?
[117:36.68]Maybe I've done that a lot.
[117:38.06]Maybe, are we sure that's not the only time I really kind of leaned into that?
[117:45.00]Well, if it's on there, good luck finding it.
[117:57.07]Okay, so this is, what is going on here?
[118:03.45]Monster!
[118:11.28]EDF.
[118:13.20]Monsters!
[118:14.98]Oh my god, there's a giant monster!
[118:17.62]These monsters look just like us!
[118:19.34]They're just insects.
[118:27.69]Where's the new EDF?
[118:28.95]Isn't that coming out?
[118:30.23]Or is it already out?
[118:31.93]It's already out in Japan, right?
[118:32.87]I feel like I can do something with that.
[118:39.15]And we're batch testing EDF.
[118:43.37]What do you guys even like?
[118:46.05]What do you guys like?
[118:46.91]Do you guys like anything?
[118:49.21]What do you guys even like?
[119:05.22]No.
[119:05.28]Okay, so this is where this was.
[119:08.93]This is a restaurant candle.
[119:10.07]It's not real.
[119:10.69]Alright, so... What does it want me to do?
[119:16.54]Maybe just pick it up and bring it this way?
[119:23.48]It's getting too far away.
[119:42.70]Oh, that's convenient.
[119:44.38]Wait, what else is here?
[119:48.54]Okay, so now we'll let... Can I turn this on?
[120:10.99]That's down there.
[120:14.59]I got it.
[120:14.99]I figured it out.
[120:21.12]Moonlight.
[120:24.28]Oh.
[120:26.68]Okay, I guess this thing is worse.
[120:42.19]Moonlight.
[120:46.98]Oh, 25.
[120:47.44]That's good.
[120:48.04]True mentor.
[120:52.21]Like guiding moonlight.
[121:00.51]You were at my side all along.
[121:06.71]Monsters!
[121:22.95]Okay, so I can move these around.
[121:24.27]Alright.
[121:35.95]Move that out of the way.
[121:38.95]There's a lot of shit going on in this shrine.
[121:43.27]Okay.
[121:45.31]What's this for?
[121:47.25]Okay.
[121:51.07]Okay.
[121:54.04]Does that stay on forever?
[121:54.68]There's a, uh... There's a treasure chest over here.
[122:05.33]Definitely gonna open that.
[122:12.23]Ancient Core.
[122:14.20]Mm-hmm.
[122:23.07]What's the point of being able to do this?
[122:31.24]Can I move one of these places?
[122:32.68]Yeah, so Vampire Survivors, Elden Ring, and what's number three?
[122:48.75]What's number three?
[122:50.37]You can't talk, never mind.
[122:54.17]See, the problem with every time I try to come up with a game of the year list, I run into this issue every time.
[123:00.99]I am such an erratic weirdo when it comes to playing games.
[123:04.45]And when games come out.
[123:05.75]And when games have released.
[123:08.29]For instance, I'm playing Breath of the Wild right now.
[123:10.25]This game came out almost, what, five years ago.
[123:14.08]I have no sense of time when anything has ever released.
[123:17.16]Because I'll play a game from like 2006.
[123:18.32]And then a game from like 2018.
[123:20.86]And then a game from like 2020.
[123:21.60]And then like 2022.
[123:22.20]And then like 2019 again.
[123:23.48]So I just don't even know when anything has ever released.
[123:31.69]So I need to be reminded of like what I played this year that actually released this year And you guys can help me with that When you're allowed to speak again Might be a while Hmm So I gotta bring a ball up here
[124:02.78]Where's this ball?
[124:08.60]Where's the ball?
[124:10.21]I hope nobody heard that.
[124:17.57]Ball.
[124:26.76]Oh, you cheated.
[124:27.44]Thank you.
[124:39.09]any lightning arrows.
[124:40.93]Where's the ball?
[124:52.32]Where's the ball?
[125:01.21]Where's the ball?
[125:16.85]Gift sub, please.
[125:22.41]Did I fuck the whole thing up?
[125:28.17]Did I mess up everything?
[125:28.99]Because I don't think I can... I don't have the electricity ball or whatever cube.
[125:34.91]Oh, there it is.
[125:35.55]I have to take this with me.
[125:48.64]I'll take you down with me.
[125:50.26]What's that from?
[125:53.32]That exact way that I said that.
[125:55.00]What's that from?
[126:04.31]You fall down.
[126:18.13]Oh, Resident Sleeper.
[126:19.01]It's a puzzle game.
[126:24.93]Hey.
[126:27.11]Take that somewhere else.
[126:29.85]Take that somewhere else.
[126:35.99]There we go.
[126:36.39]I got it.
[126:42.96]Go.
[126:43.14]Go.
[126:53.29]There it is.
[126:53.75]Did the game crash?
[127:08.47]I'm gonna bring it with me.
[127:09.09]I think that's the plan.
[127:30.67]It's definitely gonna be something weird where I have to take it with me.
[127:35.82]There's gonna be some chest that I can get, right?
[128:17.06]There's nothing... I feel like this would be a thing to... I can't do this for them?
[128:39.85]There's a chest in here.
[128:48.06]Stay right there.
[128:50.46]Right?
[128:53.65]Yes!
[128:53.93]There's a chest in here.
[128:58.03]Okay, so I gotta move.
[128:59.09]Hold on.
[129:02.59]I'll just walk off this fucking edge.
[129:08.22]Alright, let's just get over here.
[129:09.26]Far enough away where I can move this.
[129:12.08]Okay.
[129:39.30]So I didn't even need to... whatever.
[129:47.77]Get ready to nominate that one.
[129:48.79]Am I in trouble?
[130:29.44]I can make a comeback.
[130:33.85]Okay, that's enough.
[130:59.86]No, I don't want I want to go Shit Where is it?
[131:03.68]Oh No, it's just out of range no, oh
[131:30.24]I freaked out because the big cube was behind me and it was pushing me off the platform.
[131:34.96]I freaked out.
[131:48.03]Where am I?
[131:49.87]Where am I?
[131:51.05]What is this place?
[131:52.35]What's going on?
[132:03.00]Where the hell am I?
[132:19.99]Okay, now this... How do I get back over there?
[132:22.99]There it is.
[132:23.83]Okay.
[132:36.68]Hey, if you do not like this in the chat, you're dumb.
[132:39.84]That's what it means today.
[132:43.54]If you do not like this today on Twitch, it means that you're dumb.
[132:57.65]Okay, let's do this the correct way.
[133:12.78]Yeah, it's opposite day, so if you do resident sleeper, it also means that you're having a ton of fun and shit.
[133:32.25]Alright, do I have four?
[133:33.23]I think I might have three or four.
[133:35.83]That was kind of a cool one.
[133:40.88]That was a fun one.
[133:48.30]That is number three.
[133:50.46]Okay, so I need one more.
[133:52.90]Levels of copium never seen before.
[133:59.72]What did you say?
[134:00.20]Not only did you make me lose a possible PB in Minesweeper, but I trusted you.
[134:07.53]PB in Minesweeper?
[134:08.79]Like a speedrun?
[134:18.51]Alright, this is going to sound really weird, but I just realized that I was sitting kind of like on my left ball for the last two hours and it hurts.
[134:31.06]It hurts a lot.
[134:33.62]I've been just sitting on it.
[134:35.56]It ever happened to anybody?
[134:39.31]It's like my body hurts.
[134:42.53]I just realized it right now.
[134:50.84]No, I don't want to do the hero thing.
[134:54.02]Okay, so I gotta go... Where's the tower?
[134:55.92]I want to get it.
[134:56.44]It's like over here somewhere.
[134:57.62]Ooh, look at that!
[134:58.30]I don't care.
[134:58.68]There's a tower right here.
[135:04.96]I lost all my points, dude.
[135:06.08]You suck.
[135:07.60]Well, what are you... You're gambling!
[135:09.54]I... What do you mean?
[135:14.28]I didn't tell you to do that.
[135:30.54]Yeah, sorry.
[135:31.04]I don't know that people do, like, side bets on this stream of if I'm gonna, like, shit my pants or not.
[135:36.41]I don't know what you're doing over here.
[135:37.87]What is... Ooh.
[135:45.21]That's interesting.
[135:48.07]That's very interesting.
[135:49.39]I know how to get that, too.
[135:50.47]I gotta jump from the top.
[135:55.55]What is the... What is the tower?
[136:12.42]Wasn't the tower right over here somewhere?
[136:14.88]I did see it.
[136:15.40]Did I see it?
[136:16.46]Where?
[136:18.09]Not that one.
[136:18.61]There's another one over here.
[136:19.35]Oh, there it is.
[136:21.79]I don't think I can do this, though.
[136:26.77]Hold on.
[136:27.05]I gotta go around.
[136:27.63]I gotta go this way.
[136:31.05]Shh.
[136:32.55]Shh.
[136:34.71]He's freezing.
[136:35.57]I'm gonna be fine.
[136:36.45]So...
[136:46.76]I'm not going to be fine.
[136:48.78]So I'm going to take a speed potion.
[136:51.07]Right now.
[136:57.58]High level movement speed boost.
[136:59.42]We'll do mid level.
[137:16.65]Hurry up!
[137:26.71]Equip a fire weapon?
[137:32.61]That works!
[137:33.43]Oh my goodness, it works!
[137:37.57]That's cool.
[137:38.99]That's really cool, I didn't even know that.
[137:51.62]Speed boost.
[137:52.66]Speed boost.
[137:55.88]Okay, so that chest is... I gotta go up a little higher.
[137:58.12]And float to it.
[138:00.98]Right here.
[138:02.18]Something can get up there.
[138:04.40]What's in there?
[138:04.94]Okay, it's like... Are there five arrows in this chest?
[138:15.65]Is it worth me getting this?
[138:24.33]Come on.
[138:29.39]I don't think I can use the magnet on it.
[138:30.60]Can I?
[138:32.60]No, I can't.
[138:33.08]I made it out of wood or something.
[138:37.44]Get the tower first.
[138:40.38]That's the smart play, and I'm going to listen to that person because that's the actual smart thing to do.
[138:46.31]We're close enough to that.
[138:47.11]Let's just get it.
[139:02.08]Mark it.
[139:02.42]I know where it is.
[139:13.87]It's right there.
[139:21.67]Like this thing here.
[139:24.69]Go.
[139:33.06]Can you please do a link impression?
[139:34.50]Yeah, sure.
[139:42.29]You have to go all in, and I'm not... I'm not sure... I'm not sure I'm ready to go all in right now.
[139:55.70]Does that make sense?
[139:57.46]It's like Tasmanian Devil.
[139:58.30]You have to go all in to do it.
[140:01.02]I definitely can't climb that, so we have to go all the way up.
[140:06.07]Yeah.
[140:17.32]I would have swung, but anything to not use the weapon.
[140:19.66]I don't want to use the weapon.
[140:20.76]It's nice.
[140:21.30]I would rather die than have my collectible fire sword get damaged.
[140:29.04]Fuck.
[140:29.68]Okay.
[140:29.78]Okay.
[140:48.12]Stop yelling things like that.
[140:49.92]It's like, no, it's like, no, it's lame.
[140:51.50]Like, don't do that.
[140:54.27]It's like an ironic joke.
[140:55.89]Like, oh, look out below, you monster.
[140:57.57]Like, stop doing it.
[140:59.37]I don't even think it's funny either.
[141:01.71]That was an awful way to go.
[141:18.80]suspicious I forgot that emote was still here What was the point of that?
[142:04.44]Wait, they're not attacking.
[142:05.32]I thought they were circling me.
[142:13.08]I thought they were going to attack me.
[142:41.48]Shit.
[142:48.55]Do it!
[142:54.35]Oh, that's so annoying.
[142:57.87]By the way, I think I figured out... Hold on.
[143:03.60]Oh, I hate that.
[143:04.56]It's the worst.
[143:05.46]Oh.
[143:14.42]I'm trying to look at the light to sneeze.
[143:16.02]I had to sneeze and I was trying to look right into the light and usually it works.
[143:20.91]But the light's not bright enough.
[143:24.21]Thank you for the Wikipedia article.
[143:29.55]And the reason why it didn't work?
[143:31.09]This light's not on.
[143:32.71]That one is.
[143:33.41]It would have worked.
[143:38.00]I'm sitting in a... That's why the camera looks so stupid today.
[144:03.93]I just like changed the tone of the room Nice gamer neck
[144:32.84]Throw us your pants.
[144:33.58]No, you don't.
[144:34.34]Why would you need to see those?
[144:35.22]There's no reason to see them.
[144:40.32]All that matters is streamer.
[144:42.60]This is, I'm streamer from here.
[144:44.11]That's it.
[144:45.23]No!
[144:46.83]I think I saved it.
[145:04.51]I have to get high enough where I can glide back over there.
[145:18.14]Where am I?
[145:34.58]Oh my god.
[145:35.44]I'm just... I'm gonna be fine, right?
[145:38.76]I'm just gonna teleport to... Yeah, okay.
[145:41.83]Thank god.
[145:42.47]Fuck, I'm sorry.
[145:59.04]What the hell?
[146:00.26]Why did he do that?
[146:03.82]He just got sucked in there.
[146:05.06]I was trying to say, MonkaW.
[146:08.92]But my voice cracked while I said W. So it sounded really, really bad.
[146:12.65]It was like, MonkaW.
[146:15.11]Oh, we're gonna run off the edge.
[146:32.55]Get down.
[146:37.50]Did he just run into the wall?
[146:52.03]This is weirdly placed.
[146:56.85]Thank God.
[147:01.18]I got something for you.
[147:17.07]Where is it?
[147:19.04]What?
[147:20.70]Where did the explosive go?
[147:22.30]Somebody tell me.
[147:32.37]Don't throw that.
[147:34.69]Back up.
[147:45.89]What is happening right now?
[147:49.64]I'm so confused!
[147:55.80]Where are my weapons?
[148:10.20]You!
[148:10.44]Hi, Sarah!
[148:39.78]Not even a hard game.
[148:52.03]Good.
[149:00.09]I need some more shitty weapons.
[149:09.05]Roasted wild berry.
[149:10.05]Okay.
[149:11.95]What the fuck is that?
[149:13.11]Dude, I don't know.
[149:22.59]Alright, so now... I have to get all the way up here.
[149:27.13]This is tricky.
[149:33.44]The sword?
[149:35.46]Wait, where is it?
[149:46.00]You're being extra goofy today.
[149:47.42]I don't know.
[149:49.49]Sometimes I just get in a mood.
[149:50.43]It just kind of happens.
[150:16.82]How'd you only get one?
[150:17.70]See you.
[150:46.16]Oh, I could have just done that.
[150:50.10]OK.
[150:50.68]Keep going.
[151:16.67]No, stop asking for sounds that are out of meme circulation that have been for a year.
[151:46.90]Can I get from here?
[151:48.38]No.
[151:49.02]It's that.
[151:49.96]From that launch pad up there.
[151:52.51]Did you play Hades?
[152:00.75]I did.
[152:02.31]I liked it.
[152:02.65]I thought it was great.
[152:04.47]I streamed it a few times.
[152:08.93]Hmm.
[152:14.98]I imagine this is being weighed down.
[152:20.67]Through a bowling stream.
[152:26.15]I actually don't hate that idea.
[152:37.27]But we have to go through all the sports, right?
[152:40.39]Well, maybe not.
[152:41.11]Not all of them.
[152:50.93]Roasted hydra melon.
[152:55.45]Ooh, that's 50.
[153:04.52]20.
[153:16.44]Easy.
[153:19.78]Crickets.
[153:35.70]I'm not sure what that's for, but whatever.
[153:39.12]I bet you can't toy boat.
[153:41.30]I did an unbelievable toy boat.
[153:44.82]This was yesterday.
[153:47.52]Yeah, this was the day before yesterday.
[153:50.00]It was an unbelievable one.
[153:51.00]It was probably the best one I've ever done.
[153:52.06]I genuinely believe that.
[153:56.05]That was the best toy boat that I've ever done on this channel.
[153:58.45]There's no way it wasn't.
[153:59.31]Okay, well I need to bring that.
[154:09.09]How many was it actually in a row?
[154:10.14]Because once you get to about 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in a row, it becomes actually like, whoa, you did it for real.
[155:01.89]Stop, you're 37, relax.
[155:23.97]Top 10 gamer rage moments.
[155:30.06]Jerma985 had a little bit of trouble with the magnetic box puzzle next to Gerudo Village I have to go all the way down here Number 15
[156:27.69]Yeah.
[156:34.49]Oh, OK.
[157:00.46]Top 15 yeah moments.
[157:02.17]That'd be funny to make a parody of those and have it just be something so dumb and specific that nobody has done.
[157:18.32]We're going to go over the top 15.
[157:20.22]Let's go.
[157:20.88]It's on Twitch.
[157:24.14]Like, why?
[157:24.86]Who cares?
[157:31.24]We're gonna go over the top five.
[157:37.54]Let's freaking go!
[157:38.60]That would be- I would- I want to do it so bad.
[157:44.79]And have me be number one.
[157:46.01]Yeah, oh, top ten.
[157:58.71]Ooh, oh, oohs.
[158:01.75]And there's 10 different streamers doing this.
[158:08.13]You know, get like a bunch of top streamers just to like do it for a joke.
[158:12.26]Like, oh my god, I can't believe what happened.
[158:15.32]It's like a thing people do.
[158:17.84]And of course, I would still be number one.
[158:28.61]I would be the top three spots.
[158:32.73]I got this meme locked down.
[158:34.41]This thing's kind of dumb.
[158:57.47]Why do I have a smoky eye today?
[159:01.24]The lighting is wrong.
[159:08.70]Yo, I'll just make something up that no one has said.
[159:11.02]Make a new phrase that people do in times of exclamation.
[159:14.64]Somebody said I had white walker makeup on.
[159:49.91]Here we go.
[159:50.33]It's time to jump.
[159:54.72]I got to land this.
[159:56.02]I've got to get it.
[159:57.32]Even if people are going to scream, no, this is wrong.
[159:59.54]I'm doing it.
[160:00.10]I've already done it.
[160:11.42]Very good.
[160:29.71]Let's freaking go let's go Yeah, and and make this fake exclamation
[160:40.13]Hire and rent out a whole huge place.
[160:43.88]And have a fake LAN.
[160:46.26]And have people playing Street Fighter.
[160:48.32]And have like a hundred people in the audience.
[160:50.62]And somebody wins the tournament, or whatever it is.
[160:53.87]And they say the thing.
[160:56.27]And that's like number two.
[160:59.81]This is not real.
[161:00.57]Yeah, where's this accordion coming from?
[161:18.82]What is this open?
[161:25.12]Everybody in the audience, it's just like on the count of three, like, here we go, he's gonna say it, and everybody fucking scream.
[161:31.39]I have two commentators just talking.
[161:35.79]There's a person here.
[161:38.55]Really intense commentary, and they all kind of say it too afterwards.
[161:43.30]It's like a big thing people do.
[161:49.76]You know, sometimes I just really wish I had unlimited money.
[161:56.36]I would just do this stuff once a week.
[162:06.62]So what's going on up here?
[162:13.66]What did you get from McDonald's earlier?
[162:15.04]I didn't go to McDonald's earlier.
[162:18.84]No, somebody else was saying they're going to McDonald's.
[162:25.84]Okay.
[162:29.38]I hope to play the song for the hero someday.
[162:32.17]Wait a minute.
[162:36.47]Okay.
[162:39.25]I think we're going to hear it about me.
[162:44.41]Let's hear it.
[162:47.29]Here it goes.
[163:04.29]Prize.
[163:04.77]I wasn't looking at all.
[163:08.73]I just have read the last word.
[163:15.90]Let's do it again, because I wasn't listening.
[163:18.54]I was looking over at the chat.
[163:24.80]What was it said something about a prize?
[163:28.37]Oh, that's alright, I got it right here.
[163:30.21]As light shines from the northwest skies, from the tower's shadow an arrow flies.
[163:35.11]Pierce heaven's light to reveal the prize.
[163:37.30]Solve the riddle of the ancient song.
[163:41.44]Okay, a light shines from the northwest skies.
[163:45.38]Where is north?
[163:47.56]Light shines from the northwest skies.
[163:50.98]That's the sun.
[163:54.94]From the tower's shadow an arrow flies.
[163:58.38]Where's the Shadow Venterra?
[164:06.28]Okay.
[164:08.96]From the shadows ta- where is... what is it?
[164:19.60]Here's Heaven's Light to reveal the prize.
[164:31.94]I don't get it.
[165:07.41]As the sun shines from northwest, the tower's shadow... Shoot an arrow at the shadow?
[165:16.16]Here's heaven's light.
[165:17.20]Shoot an arrow... I'm just gonna do it.
[165:19.56]Whatever.
[165:32.31]Or is that fire?
[165:33.91]Is this like... Do I have to shoot...
[165:37.68]And blight at the top with fire?
[165:49.91]Shadow of the Tower.
[165:51.53]When the sun is north.
[165:52.49]I think I missed my opportunity.
[165:56.13]Yeah, I missed my opportunity.
[165:57.03]Do I have to wait?
[166:03.70]How do I do this?
[166:09.04]How's this work?
[166:12.86]Is it that thing?
[166:15.66]I think it might be that thing.
[166:30.40]Come on.
[166:43.37]It's not, oh.
[167:00.94]Oh, the shadow's gone.
[167:01.78]Can I sleep till morning?
[167:06.22]How do you pass time?
[167:15.85]How do I pass time?
[167:33.45]Someone just said this part in Oliver sounds like the arcade game sound effects.
[167:38.05]What?
[167:44.46]Okay, so it is fire, but fire, where do I have to put the fire?
[167:48.04]What time is it?
[167:48.84]It's 10 p.m.
[167:49.78]It's got to be with the sun shining.
[168:02.94]I'm not stupid, I know.
[168:10.39]One day I want to just hire a CG artist to put, like, an overlay over.
[168:13.82]So I can have, like, a huge, like, frog butt one day.
[168:16.20]Just be like... And have, like... And everyone would just freak out.
[168:23.31]Why is it taking 10 minutes to travel?
[168:43.39]Not like this.
[168:44.39]Not like this.
[168:45.42]Not like this.
[168:46.40]This guy sucks.
[168:47.42]Not like this.
[168:48.38]This guy sucks.
[169:08.47]I have to burn this.
[169:09.78]I have to blight this on fire.
[169:15.53]I have to burn that.
[169:19.52]No.
[169:21.16]What is this tent you guys are talking about?
[169:22.92]There's no tent.
[169:27.22]There's a shrine right there.
[169:31.57]Wait, what tent?
[169:35.37]You mean like, hit like this?
[169:37.41]Burn that?
[169:38.27]That tent?
[169:39.95]Instead of that, you want me to burn this?
[169:41.57]Or do you want me to burn this?
[169:45.44]I'm gonna burn that.
[169:46.88]No.
[169:48.64]Burn the tent.
[169:49.54]Burn the tent.
[169:50.34]Fire tent.
[169:51.38]Fire tent.
[169:53.10]What the hell?
[169:55.86]That looks like a tent.
[170:08.15]No.
[170:16.32]What do you want me to burn?
[170:21.61]Bomb.
[170:34.12]Tent.
[170:34.46]Fire.
[170:35.08]Resident sleeper.
[170:35.86]Tent.
[170:36.34]Fire.
[170:36.74]Resident sleeper.
[170:38.72]Fire.
[170:39.20]Sleep.
[170:39.74]Sleep.
[170:40.52]Fire.
[170:41.02]Go to sleep and then do a fire.
[170:43.62]How do you sleep?
[170:47.60]Sleep, Doritos.
[170:48.62]Sleep at the fire.
[170:49.56]Sleep at the fire.
[170:50.26]There's a fire somewhere.
[170:51.36]I don't... There's no fire, though.
[170:52.48]Where are you... Should I jump down from here?
[170:54.39]Should I jump down right there?
[170:57.53]Should I jump down right here?
[171:04.27]Jump down here.
[171:04.99]That's a lot of no's.
[171:08.37]Okay, um...
[171:20.04]What's that?
[171:23.73]Is that it?
[171:52.76]Okay, fire.
[172:10.71]Did I miss my opportunity or something?
[172:16.56]Tent, fire.
[172:17.42]What's the- where's our tent?
[172:23.26]I missed my opportunity, so I have to sit.
[172:25.19]Alright.
[172:25.93]How do I speed?
[172:26.47]Is there like a drink I can drink that speeds time up?
[172:32.77]Tent.
[172:33.75]What is a tent?
[172:34.81]I don't have any tents.
[172:47.59]Okay.
[172:48.19]Is wood...
[173:03.25]Oh, I didn't know you could do that.
[173:08.86]Okay.
[173:15.66]Now... I shoot this when it... I gotta be ready now.
[173:24.07]This is gonna start glowing and then I shoot it with a fire arrow.
[173:35.21]No.
[173:35.45]Huh?
[173:38.70]What do you mean, no?
[173:41.40]Do I just stand in this?
[173:42.38]I don't understand what you mean.
[173:49.22]Just stand in it.
[173:51.27]Okay.
[173:51.51]6,000 viewers left.
[173:53.59]Almost 7,000.
[174:07.73]Okay, here we go.
[174:19.42]Okay.
[174:21.24]What's going on?
[174:21.88]Where is it?
[174:22.28]Okay.
[174:46.27]Here it comes.
[174:48.44]This is it.
[175:01.29]I am playing with fire right now for no reason.
[175:04.91]Here it comes.
[175:09.59]Fire.
[175:11.00]Sun, sun, sun.
[175:11.92]Shoot the sun?
[175:19.64]Shoot the sun with a fire arrow, or just shoot the sun.
[175:30.49]Oh, it's not time yet.
[175:49.52]You guys didn't have anything to do today.
[175:50.74]Let's go!
[176:27.79]Is it a shrine?
[176:32.56]Oh, it's a shrine.
[176:33.54]This is my favorite thing.
[176:46.93]Cool.
[176:47.91]I wonder what's in here.
[176:48.57]This is secret.
[176:49.09]I like these little secrets.
[177:04.58]It was supposed to be a campfire.
[177:05.76]I thought you were trying to tell me to shoot the tents, like the camps.
[177:13.80]Like, you need to burn that tent over there.
[177:15.55]I don't know.
[177:21.41]So, this is a test of, a modest test of strength.
[177:24.73]Alright, well, let's go ahead and get this ready.
[177:32.13]Damage food, maybe?
[177:33.83]Yeah, why not?
[177:38.08]I got my really good guardian weapon that I've been saving for this exact moment.
[177:44.99]And I'm ready.
[177:57.96]I hate you Already?
[178:31.08]Here we go!
[179:13.24]Take him out.
[179:13.64]Take him out before he does anything.
[179:14.72]Take him out.
[179:15.12]Ooh, what's that?
[179:18.32]A lot of stuff there.
[179:20.66]That wasn't that bad.
[179:26.63]Guardian sword plus.
[179:28.41]It's a 60 damage.
[179:36.87]Hmm.
[179:38.33]Oh, yeah.
[179:38.70]Get rid of this.
[179:42.35]Guardian spear.
[179:43.51]All this stuff.
[179:44.25]Nice.
[179:46.79]Okay.
[179:48.74]So this would give me four and I can upgrade.
[179:50.80]What should I upgrade?
[179:51.42]Health or... I'm going to do stamina, I think.
[179:52.88]What do you guys think?
[180:00.16]Frost blade.
[180:00.98]Uh-oh.
[180:04.04]That's really cool.
[180:07.33]That's so cool.
[180:08.29]I don't know.
[180:09.11]Should I get a sword?
[180:10.11]Oh, this spear is really not that great.
[180:18.14]Actually, is the spear better than the sword?
[180:21.13]Eh, probably not.
[180:25.59]Health for the master sword?
[180:26.59]True.
[180:27.35]What can I do?
[180:33.21]That's really cool looking.
[180:34.05]Alright, cool.
[180:34.51]So I'll do health.
[180:37.74]Find a shrine.
[180:45.95]Does the Master Sword break?
[180:47.21]Yeah, does the Master Sword break?
[180:54.76]That would be... Okay, it doesn't.
[180:58.40]Pepe left.
[180:58.92]Alright, well, I don't know.
[181:05.58]Kind of, not really, but yes.
[181:06.98]Alright, well, that helps.
[181:07.85]Okay.
[181:12.77]Don't worry, I'm just not going to use it once and just throw it again at the end of the game.
[181:17.16]People think that's a joke, but I'm actually going to do that and see if I can beat it.
[181:22.45]Collect all the legendary weapons and just throw them all at Ganon.
[181:29.23]Okay.
[181:31.07]It is time for us... It's been about three hours.
[181:35.77]It's time to move here to the sponsored part of the stream.
[181:39.89]We're going to play Multiverses for a couple hours or so.
[181:43.94]I do want to get...
[181:47.73]to... I do want to do... Yeah, let me just make sure I'm where I want to be the next time.
[182:07.90]Yeah, Season 2 of Multiverses is, I think, started today.
[182:10.04]Just a couple of new characters that I haven't played with.
[182:13.42]I think they just announced... What did they just announce?
[182:16.38]Hold on.
[182:19.19]When is Frog Detective going to happen?
[182:23.81]Frog Detective is going to happen when I can do voices.
[182:27.96]One of three voices.
[182:32.32]So I'm going to take a quick BRB.
[182:33.94]We'll move to Multiversus.
[182:34.96]It's going to be sponsored by Warner Brothers.
[182:37.16]They've been really good to the channel.
[182:39.04]I have not played Multiversus in a little while.
[182:40.58]It's ranked now.
[182:41.48]So I'm going to be trying that out.
[182:44.06]Probably going to rage quit it in five minutes.
[182:49.43]Yeah, Marvin, right?
[182:51.19]Marvin Martian.
[182:53.53]That's funny.
[182:55.41]Where's Daffy Duck?
[182:56.29]I want Daffy Duck.
[182:57.81]Alright, I'll be right back.
[182:59.79]Gonna get everything set up.
[183:00.91]Should be like maybe a few minutes.
[183:02.83]Thanks for watching this portion of the stream.
[183:07.06]Breath of the Wild.
[183:07.62]I'm still enjoying it.
[183:08.36]We'll see it again soon.
[183:09.16]I'll be right back.
[183:11.62]Time for multiverses.
[183:15.60]I am gonna do a couple things first before I go there.
[183:20.71]Like for instance, this doesn't need to be on anymore.
[183:24.65]And neither does this.
[183:27.86]That looks good.
[183:31.20]Okay.
