[00:08.74]Zoey looks terrible in this poster.
[00:13.76]She looks huge.
[00:17.36]She's got the same body shape.
[00:19.34]She has the same body shape as a pyro.
[00:25.03]Alright, Boo, introduce this.
[00:26.49]Death tool.
[00:27.35]Hell came to Earth.
[00:28.43]These four are gonna send it back.
[00:31.01]That was awful.
[00:32.01]Why did you say it like the demo, man?
[00:33.54]I had like eight different accents.
[00:36.48]I knew that.
[00:38.94]Alright, let's, uh... Let's pull this off, boys.
[00:41.86]Alright, I'm a boomer.
[00:43.16]I'll do what a boomer is... What?
[00:45.12]Return to lobby?
[00:45.91]What?
[00:46.71]No!
[00:46.91]What are you... Yeah, right.
[00:49.09]For what?
[00:50.83]You don't want to return to lobby.
[00:52.43]Oh, like, ping?
[00:54.31]Oh, ping, ping, ping.
[00:55.85]Like, who cares?
[00:58.46]Oh, I... I don't know if this is... Well, okay.
[01:03.66]Do you gotta change the server?
[01:05.32]But Zoe looks terrible in this poster.
[01:08.39]You know what?
[01:08.77]She looks like the pyro.
[01:10.85]I hate you.
[01:13.05]What a stupid comment to make.
[01:15.89]It looks like the pyro.
[01:16.79]Get out.
[01:17.15]Never talk to me again.
[01:19.92]Death toll.
[01:20.98]Hell came to earth.
[01:22.72]These four are going to send it back.
[01:25.40]I can't wait to play both those back to back.
[01:28.86]Like, I'm going to show the first one, too.
[01:32.82]You are the worst.
[01:35.53]Their things are pretty horrible.
[01:37.65]Oh, is it really?
[01:39.13]Oh.
[01:40.05]Our things are great.
[01:44.99]Sorry.
[01:45.35]Say no.
[01:46.34]We're going to try this one more time, and that's it.
[01:50.18]I'm sorry that they're awful.
[01:51.16]They've gone.
[01:54.06]Oh, my gosh.
[01:56.46]Welcome to Left 4 Dead 2.
[02:00.24]You know what?
[02:00.74]I really think... You know, she really looks like the Pyro in this picture.
[02:07.09]Don't you guys think that?
[02:08.83]I mean, she looks exactly like the Pyro.
[02:10.97]It's crazy.
[02:12.21]How the hell did they get... Oh, okay, I get it.
[02:14.47]Yeah, buddy.
[02:15.29]Get off that tree, son.
[02:17.85]Oh, what the heck.
[02:19.07]It's too high.
[02:20.85]It kicked me out.
[02:21.63]Oh, it's made me be the tank.
[02:25.69]My ping is too high as well.
[02:30.97]I told you we just need to play against other people.
[02:35.42]I was like, I was wrecking some fools as a tank too.
[02:38.60]Dude, I got disconnected too.
[02:40.34]Your ping is too high.
[02:41.40]Well, that works.
[02:45.51]You know, we definitely should hang out by the docks, only because they can only really come from two real areas.
[02:50.95]Like, they come from straight.
[02:52.13]They can't, like, climb.
[02:52.93]What are you doing?
[02:54.53]I want to go first one.
[02:55.69]What are you doing, you idiot?
[02:58.45]Well, okay, that answers that question.
[03:00.44]Docks are not safe.
[03:01.86]What did you do?
[03:06.52]Anyway, at least, like, grab on.
[03:10.24]We'll eventually have to jump down.
[03:11.68]I will come to the rescue.
[03:14.32]of anyone who gets pulled off the roof.
[03:15.94]Alright, let's do this thing.
[03:18.58]Stay together to survive!
[03:20.46]I immediately regret going on the roof.
[03:22.48]There's a Charger up here.
[03:23.76]Oh, fuck!
[03:25.33]Since when can they climb?
[03:27.35]Oh, I just fell.
[03:28.59]Awesome.
[03:29.47]Spinner, watch out for the spinner.
[03:30.61]Oh my god, there's so many.
[03:33.07]Whoa, you're inside?
[03:34.17]I'm coming for the rescue mission.
[03:36.09]Good thing I didn't, like, edit my volume, and me shooting the gun is louder than my thoughts.
[03:41.59]Harvey Hamburger saved you.
[03:44.52]Hamburglar.
[03:45.34]Alright.
[03:46.76]There's a lot of fire on the roof, apparently.
[03:48.80]Yeah, I accidentally created all of that.
[03:51.27]Why is the burger joint on fire?
[03:54.29]Alright, try and regroup.
[03:55.05]Get back on top.
[03:56.09]Get back on top.
[03:56.67]We're good.
[03:56.93]Alright, is this a safe time to alt-tab so I can talk to people?
[04:01.27]There comes a tank.
[04:02.21]We're good.
[04:02.71]We're good.
[04:05.33]Oh god, the tank does not like me at all.
[04:09.02]Alright, Boo, sacrifice yourself and stand in the middle of the open so we can shoot the tank.
[04:12.18]Let me just do that right now.
