[00:08.60]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.12]Jirba here with some more One in the Chamber.
[00:12.79]Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
[00:15.57]And away we go!
[00:20.41]Oh, Jesus!
[00:21.33]Right off the bat, I turned the corner.
[00:22.91]Oh, you bastard!
[00:23.99]He was lying on the ground.
[00:25.87]I'll make a note of that.
[00:26.75]I'll make a mental note of that.
[00:28.83]You son of a bitch.
[00:33.78]Something going on in this...
[00:35.24]Whoa, what the hell?
[00:35.98]That guy just teleported!
[00:38.18]That guy just teleported through my screen!
[00:43.29]That guy, what the hell was that?
[00:45.39]Alright, gotta get my bearings here.
[00:51.45]That's a bad shot, I'm not taking that.
[00:54.43]Let's find my way back down the stairs.
[01:01.09]They could be anywhere!
[01:05.15]There's a guy up here.
[01:06.97]Come on.
[01:08.05]Come on.
[01:10.53]Come on.
[01:11.77]Come here.
[01:13.55]Where the... Damn.
[01:19.45]Don't shoot me.
[01:21.07]Oh, get it.
[01:22.19]No, there's another guy.
[01:22.87]No, there's not.
[01:23.85]Yeah, there is.
[01:25.27]Damn it.
[01:26.27]Damn it, crouch.
[01:28.59]Here he comes.
[01:29.15]Ready?
[01:29.95]Ah!
[01:33.22]It actually worked.
[01:34.46]It actually worked.
[01:36.82]Oh, I can't even think.
[01:40.15]Too many things going on in my brain.
[01:42.61]Whoa, what the hell?
[01:45.73]I just, like, panic knifed.
[01:51.35]Oh, boy.
[01:52.11]Oh, boy, oh.
[01:56.83]What?
[01:57.85]Oh, he's still running.
[01:59.65]The guy back here, I'm gonna try and just...
[02:02.49]God, I didn't make one shot with the... I didn't make one shot with this freaking knife.
[02:08.23]I mean, with this freaking gun.
[02:12.17]I gotta be... I need to... I can still win this.
[02:17.46]Just gotta play smart.
[02:18.32]There's only two guys here.
[02:20.66]Time to play smart.
[02:21.32]Here we go.
[02:22.46]Smart German.
[02:23.06]Here we go.
[02:27.23]Whoa, that guy's just sitting right there.
[02:32.32]Oh, what do you know about that one?
[02:35.18]Bastard.
[02:41.42]Is that him?
[02:42.26]It's him!
[02:42.97]What?
[02:46.29]No!
[02:47.25]No!
[02:53.71]I don't think I've played on this map yet.
[02:56.46]This is one of the only ones that nobody ever plays on.
[02:58.76]Maybe I have.
[03:00.68]Let's go.
[03:07.86]This map is big, too.
[03:09.06]This is a big map.
[03:09.96]This is going to be tough.
[03:14.26]Damn it.
[03:14.96]That guy's got a bullet.
[03:17.20]Freak him out.
[03:18.24]It worked.
[03:21.00]Wow.
[03:21.70]Hey, man.
[03:22.48]Whoa.
[03:24.76]Big map.
[03:26.62]Big casualties.
[03:27.82]I got you.
[03:30.82]I still got you.
[03:33.62]I got you.
[03:34.18]Whoa, a guy behind me.
[03:37.32]No needin' to freak out.
[03:38.84]No needin' to freak out.
[03:40.08]No reason to... Jeez Louise.
[03:43.98]Oh my goodness.
[03:45.29]People are everywhere.
[03:46.11]Oh, there's a guy behind me too.
[03:48.15]Get out of my face.
[03:51.79]Let's go down.
[03:53.19]I got three bullets here.
[03:54.43]Just calm down, Jerma.
[03:55.47]Just calm down.
[03:56.97]You don't gotta freak out.
[03:58.31]You got three shots in this gun.
[04:00.63]You got the upper hand.
[04:06.05]There we go.
[04:07.25]See this guy right here?
[04:08.01]This guy's toast, too.
[04:09.81]If I could... He's probably gonna... I'm scared.
[04:12.25]I am legitimately scared to go around this corner.
[04:17.48]There's a guy right here.
[04:18.22]Come on.
[04:19.12]Show yourself.
[04:21.12]Oh, this guy's doing a ring around the rosy with me.
[04:26.04]Come on, man!
[04:29.34]Come on!
[04:32.30]No!
[04:33.02]And he got the kill!
[04:34.12]Oh...
[04:37.54]Ashes, ashes, we all freaking fall down apparently.
[04:42.14]I'm gonna shoot that guy in his head when I get the chance.
[04:49.75]Is anybody even over here?
[04:50.53]There's only one dude.
[04:52.87]I got one life.
[04:54.51]What?
[04:54.77]What is going on in this room?
[04:56.19]Why are there two guys just like hanging out in here?
[04:59.57]What the hell is going on in here?
[05:01.67]What on earth?
[05:03.31]What on earth is happening in this room?
[05:08.13]Those two guys are just sitting there having tea.
[05:12.84]Alright, I'm on my last life now.
[05:17.76]I'm gonna die.
[05:18.48]There's one guy in here.
[05:23.07]Yeah, put your head through that door.
[05:26.71]What?
[05:27.85]Oh man.
[05:29.73]Oh man!
[05:32.10]No, no, no!
[05:33.78]Oh, I lose!
[05:36.52]Well, not technically, no.
[05:38.04]Let's see, I got nine kills.
[05:40.08]Yeah, nobody could pass that right now.
[05:42.20]This next guy below me has three.
[05:43.99]So, yeah, I'm going to win this game.
[05:46.41]That's the thing about One in the Chamber.
[05:48.07]You can kill, like, five or six people in a row and then die three times in a row and still win the game, so it's pretty cool.
[05:54.39]Anyways, let's see how this ends.
[05:56.03]Let's go, man!
[05:58.85]Hey, look, chickpeas!
[06:02.31]I can't believe I died.
[06:03.31]I would have been like 12-0 if I didn't screw up in one place.
[06:06.25]But there was like two guys camping in the same room.
[06:09.27]What the hell was that all about?
[06:11.29]Ban them all booted.
[06:12.19]Get them out of here.
[06:14.75]Let's close it out on the cruise level.
[06:18.37]Time to take a cruise.
[06:21.95]Okay, we got a guy right here.
[06:24.87]And we got a guy over there too.
[06:26.55]Two guys.
[06:28.75]Don't be too crazy.
[06:31.74]Don't be too crazy.
[06:35.50]Don't be... Too... Why did I do that?
[06:40.70]What the hell?
[06:42.82]The knife went... Get up the stairs.
[06:45.17]There's a guy coming up.
[06:46.69]Oh, God.
[06:47.55]Oh, God.
[06:48.45]Oh, my God.
[06:49.13]He's coming.
[06:50.63]No, he's not.
[06:52.53]Oh.
[06:54.27]What?
[06:54.77]Come on.
[06:57.48]Oh, Lord...
[06:59.16]I don't know how those knives, how are these knives not hitting?
[07:04.22]I mean, I have a three bar, but that's not that bad.
[07:09.20]Dude, those knives were going into, like, the abyss.
[07:11.82]It's as if I wasn't even hitting the button.
[07:15.36]It's alright.
[07:17.24]We'll push through here, we'll push through.
[07:19.30]Wow!
[07:22.02]I shouldn't even knife anybody anymore.
[07:26.24]I should just put the knife away.
[07:30.70]Last guy, last guy, last guy!
[07:33.34]Hello there!
[07:34.20]Mr. Guy!
[07:36.10]Oh, moment of truth!
[07:39.10]The knife!
[07:40.18]Alright, I'm gonna get this guy right now.
[07:44.81]I'm not gonna use the knife!
[07:50.91]Oh, it doesn't even matter!
[07:52.13]The knife prevails!
[07:59.20]Oh my goodness.
[08:00.18]All right.
[08:00.46]Well, that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[08:02.64]Thank you so much for watching.
[08:03.68]I really do appreciate it.
[08:04.93]And I'll see you all next time.
[08:06.27]And of course, take care, everybody.
[08:08.69]Connection interrupted.
