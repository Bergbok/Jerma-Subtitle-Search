[01:17.91]Alright, so what I know about this game is you're supposed to go do things.
[01:20.19]You're supposed to go, like, like, yell at your kids and, like, yell at your wife or something.
[01:25.08]I don't know.
[01:25.48]But you're not supposed to, like, people know that you're an octopus.
[01:29.18]I'm not sure how that's possible seeing as how I am an octopus in a suit.
[01:32.60]I don't know how this works, but get up there.
[01:35.76]Climb.
[01:36.34]Oh my goodness, look at this.
[01:39.20]I'm a dainty little ballerina.
[01:41.56]Get up here.
[01:42.30]Alright, um... We're gonna go in this room first, because this room looks like, okay...

[02:19.57]Alright.
[02:21.41]Where are the dishes?
[02:23.44]Alright, I'm gonna do this in one... I'm gonna do this in one fell swoop.
[02:27.42]You guys ready for this?
[02:28.94]This is how we do it in the big leagues.
[02:33.72]Like that.
[02:35.30]I missed it.
[02:35.72]I missed a couple things.
[02:36.42]Hold on.
[02:37.12]Hold on.

[03:05.54]Clean out the fridge, mop the floor.
[03:07.10]I'll mop the floor right now, honey.
[03:09.74]Pick it up.
[03:10.82]Are you ready for our romantic evening?
[03:13.90]You're about to, like, have relations with an octopus.
[03:16.22]I don't know if you know this or not, but that's a little weird.
[03:19.62]Just do some scrubbing.
[03:20.96]That's all I gotta do.
[03:21.90]Just, you know, just do a little bit of scrubbing.
[03:25.25]What's left?
[03:26.33]There's some over there.
[03:28.29]Did it.
[03:31.29]What else do I gotta do?
[03:33.35]Dishes in the sink.
[03:35.87]I don't know where the dishes are.
[03:37.93]Oh my god, she's, like, watching me.
[03:41.77]No, that's not, that was like a six pack of Dr. Pepper.
[03:44.45]I didn't mean to do that.
[03:46.69]This goes in here.
[03:48.65]Okay, this is a dirty dish.
[03:51.62]Get in there.
[03:52.92]Shit.
[03:53.78]I just knocked it off.
[03:54.60]Well, hopefully that wasn't your cup, honey.
[03:57.02]You know what?
[03:57.56]Fuck this.
[03:58.18]We're just gonna drag this whole damn counter in there.
[04:01.92]Like that.
[04:03.08]Just get in.
[04:05.46]Get in!
[04:07.22]Done, right?
[04:09.52]You like apples?
[04:11.60]Hey, honey.
[04:13.22]I got an apple for you.
[04:15.08]Teacher's pet.
[04:17.62]Teacher's... I'm trying to make a joke here, game.
[04:19.64]Like, get me in the right spot.
[04:24.57]Get over there, you slug bastard.
[04:27.09]Get this in the sink.
[04:31.49]Yes.
[04:32.25]Oh, thank you, honey.
[04:34.65]You're welcome.
[04:39.69]Alright, time to clean the fridge out.

[04:53.14]You know what?
[04:54.12]Fuck this.
[04:56.26]Am I doing a good job?
[04:57.30]Hold on, I want to see.
[05:01.68]You can't see me.
[05:07.29]Let me close myself in the fridge.
[05:08.95]Come on.
[05:10.81]No, just turn around.
[05:11.73]Now I'm stuck.
[05:14.36]Get... Just start smashing stuff.
[05:17.00]Just go, go, go, go.
[05:19.10]Clean it out.
[05:21.22]Throw that in the air.
[05:21.86]I don't care about that at all.
[05:24.02]Just scoop it up with your tentacle hand.
[05:26.88]There we go.
[05:29.00]Perfect.
[05:30.30]Go straight in.
[05:33.43]This is not cleaning a fridge out.
[05:34.85]This is not... That was a pizza.
[05:36.47]There could have been slices in there.
[05:37.77]I could have eaten.
[05:40.35]Down the bottom, we got like a big gross cucumber.
[05:43.89]Get out of here.
[05:45.51]We got some bottles of... I don't even know what those are.
[05:49.20]But that's it.
[05:49.56]I did it.
[05:50.56]I win.
[05:52.78]Give me a kiss.
[05:57.77]Oh, I would like that banana, please give me the banana
[06:10.65]Did I ever tell you you look so beautiful in this firelight, honey?
[06:16.65]Let me just get this hand over here.
[06:18.27]Let me just take off.
[06:19.15]Yeah, honey, you know, I really love you.

[06:25.67]Is this a new hair dye?
[06:27.11]Thank you for the banana.
[06:28.62]You are such a sweetie.
[06:29.72]You dropped it.
