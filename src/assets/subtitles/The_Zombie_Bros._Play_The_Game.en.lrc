[00:11.14]What's up, Doc?
[00:20.78]What's up, Doc?
[00:22.26]I don't think a motorcycle can go through these tiny holes.
[00:27.45]It's duck season.
[00:29.63]Hey, Jeremiah, I don't... Jeremiah, I think we're playing a zombie game and I need you to cooperate.
[00:35.85]I have so much of this in my mouth, I have to, like, spit this out.
[00:41.87]Dude, come on, I'm gonna break your arms with this brick.
[00:52.58]Shit, E!
[00:53.40]Press E!
[00:54.58]Come on!
[00:59.47]One hand plays the game, the other hand pretends to be Bugs Bunny.
[01:03.01]Get in this taxi.
[01:08.37]Yeah, scoop me up in the taxi.
[01:10.31]That sounds like a good scooper.
[01:14.89]No, put the thing down.
[01:15.55]Put it down.
[01:15.91]Put the thing down.
[01:17.13]Put the thing down.
[01:19.56]What the fuck?
[01:20.30]I'm not gonna make it.
[01:23.54]Holy shit.
[01:26.96]Okay, dude, seriously.
[01:29.10]What's happening?
[01:31.08]Let me get a car.
[01:32.56]Stop.
[01:33.38]Stop driving.
[01:34.02]I'm trying to get out of here.
[01:35.38]We have to go.
[01:36.46]I know, but I want...
[01:40.44]There we go.
[01:40.92]Okay, don't do anything.
[01:42.32]Okay.
[01:42.56]Alright, now drive.
[01:46.78]Okay, now lift me up.
[01:47.80]Oh, this is gonna work.
[01:51.36]Is it gonna work?
[01:52.48]Who is this working for?
[01:53.60]I think we are lagging bad, because stuff is happening on my screen that's not... Which actually is probably a pretty good thing.
[02:06.57]So we should probably, like, go do something stupid.
[02:10.27]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:13.78]I am done.
[02:15.08]We are playing the game.
[02:16.60]Let's go.
[02:16.94]Okay.
[02:18.20]We are playing the video game Dead Rising 3.
[02:21.69]There, I helped you get out.
[02:22.49]Can my girlfriend come with us?
[02:24.19]Absolutely.
[02:24.67]Let's go.
[02:29.64]Everybody loves Tara.
[02:33.65]Oh my god, you fu- oh.
[02:35.47]What?
[02:35.93]Holy shit, that was a jump, I didn't even realize that.
[02:38.23]Don't go back, I jumped out.
[02:39.53]No, no, no, no, you idiot, did you fall?
[02:41.45]No.
[02:45.14]What are you doing?
[02:45.84]Get in!
[02:46.30]I don't wanna fall back.
[02:48.28]I'm not gonna fall back.
[02:49.04]We're gonna be so far away.
[02:50.80]You seriously think I'm gonna fall back?
[02:52.32]What a fucking dummy.
[02:58.28]Get in!
[02:59.34]I'm not doing this joke!
[03:01.20]Well then you die!
[03:02.02]I surrender!
[03:03.18]Alright, get in, for real.
[03:07.84]Get in for real this time, get in for real.
[03:10.42]I'm gonna spin around, I'm gonna do a three-point turn.
[03:14.28]I'm only doing this to get fucking, you know, able to-
[03:22.96]What?
[03:23.94]Physics.
[03:24.60]Physics, how is this possible?
[03:25.80]Oh, there's a fucking thing in the middle right here.
[03:31.28]Okay, it all worked out.
[03:32.70]Look, it all worked out.
[03:33.44]Now climb back up.
[03:34.98]Okay.
[03:35.74]Get in the car.
[03:36.87]Alright, I'll figure this all out.
[03:38.63]Get out!
[03:43.91]Jerm, I'm begging you.
[03:45.03]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[03:45.63]I'm begging you to come play the game with me.
[03:47.23]I know, but I just need to, this has to happen.
[03:49.09]Push it off.
[03:51.47]I want to see the big explosion.
[03:55.23]Come on.
[03:56.33]No, it needs to fall off.
[03:57.53]Don't just, like, throw shit at it.
[04:03.39]Fuck!
[04:05.26]What happened?
[04:08.04]Did you fall off?
[04:09.14]No!
[04:10.36]Off.
[04:11.16]Hold on a second.
[04:12.10]I'm crashing.
[04:12.52]Wait.
[04:13.94]I crashed.
[04:14.32]That's what happened.
[04:17.89]I crashed.
[04:18.81]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:22.29]I am done, we are playing the game.
[04:25.10]Let's go.
[04:26.24]Come on!
[04:27.06]Fill me with bullets!
[04:28.44]Come on, is that all you got?
[04:30.20]Come on, I can take more!
[04:31.34]I can take another 200!
[04:31.92]Another 2,000!
[04:32.62]Now eat this!
[04:38.31]No!
[04:39.37]No, I've been thwarted!
[04:44.07]I don't know what to do here, man.
[04:46.39]I can't get- there's a car blocking this way.
[04:47.90]Do you see this car blocking the exit?
[04:51.56]I see the car blocking the exit.
[04:52.80]How am I supposed to get out of here?
[04:57.79]There's a window!
[04:58.49]Did you know there was a window?
[05:02.23]Yeah.
[05:05.77]Now she's calling in her reinforcements.
[05:08.07]She has a rocket launcher.
[05:08.85]Why did I just spawn next to her?
[05:11.29]Yeah, you are right next to her.
[05:13.47]Are you alive?
[05:14.79]Yeah, the cutscene ended and I just appeared on her.
[05:17.87]I have no guns now.
[05:18.97]I'll kill her with flares.
[05:22.97]See, if you don't know where she is, she's right there.
[05:25.95]Eat this.
[05:27.43]There's a grenade under your feet.
[05:28.37]You probably should move.
[05:34.36]Get in.
[05:35.64]No.
[05:36.50]Get in the car.
[05:37.92]No.
[05:38.68]Get in the car this instant, young man.
[05:40.36]No.
[05:41.84]I got a call from Mrs. Rogerson.
[05:43.86]You got a D-minus on your math exam.
[05:46.18]No.
[05:46.64]You get in this car right now.
[05:48.30]No.
[05:49.04]Your father's gonna hear about this and he is gonna lose his shit.
[05:52.32]No!
[05:53.28]You gonna make me come all the way in the hotel?
[05:54.96]Yeah!
[05:55.50]I don't even like this hotel!
[05:57.12]They don't even serve breakfast!
[06:00.64]This thing is gonna go.
[06:01.77]This thing, if you touch a wall... Damn it.
[06:06.51]All of your gamer skills are coming together right now.
[06:08.67]Yeah, seriously, all of my gamer skills need to be here.
[06:12.09]I'm playing Operation.
[06:13.89]You gonna play Operation?
[06:15.07]The thing with like the naked guy that lies on the table and you gotta like pull his bones out?
[06:18.63]We're playing that right now.
[06:22.05]Oh yeah, that game where you pull bones out of stuff.
[06:24.45]Oh!
[06:24.65]O-Operation.
[06:26.21]Can I even- I don't think I can even go out here.
[06:27.57]I guess I can.
[06:28.11]It's buzzing so loud right now.
[06:29.69]Yeah, I've lost so many times.
[06:32.51]And this is the guy's, like, femur.
[06:34.33]That was always the hardest one.
[06:35.47]The femur was the hardest one for me.
[06:39.17]Mom, I don't wanna go to the hotel.
[06:41.09]Yo, you're in big trouble, mister.
[06:43.80]I had to come all the way into the hotel to get you, and now I've got you, and you're not gonna even get your cereal.
[06:52.15]Just like in GTA, take out the driver!
[06:54.97]I'm alright.
[07:02.71]She's ate those all in one bite!
[07:05.79]Whoa, whoa, easy, easy!
[07:06.75]What the fuck?! !
[07:16.37]I got you something.
[07:17.75]I got you a burrito from Taco Bell.
[07:19.57]It's a chalupa.
[07:21.54]Try it out.
[07:23.70]It's really good stuff.
[07:25.34]Yeah.
[07:31.75]What are you doing?
