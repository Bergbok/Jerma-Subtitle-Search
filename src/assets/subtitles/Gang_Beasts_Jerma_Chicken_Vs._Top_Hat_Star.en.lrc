[00:05.26]Hey, hey, welcome to Gang Beasts, where we punch each other in the fucking face.
[00:14.53]This is stupid.
[00:16.05]Shut up, that dinosaur.
[00:17.83]Yeah, what's with the dinosaur, everybody?
[00:24.32]This game's on Steam right now.
[00:26.64]It just got into early access.
[00:28.52]This guy, everyone's already dead.
[00:29.85]He's still punching.
[00:34.54]All right, so, I'm coming.
[00:36.56]Don't you dare.
[00:37.72]I'm gonna come to you.
[00:39.08]I'm gonna get out of here.
[00:40.37]What are you doing?
[00:40.99]You're supposed to fight me on the trunk.
[00:42.07]I don't want to fight you on the trunk.
[00:43.27]Well, that's too bad.
[00:43.93]I'm coming to you.
[00:45.39]Get out of this trunk.

[00:47.95]You're just tossing me around.
[00:51.63]I just clotheslined you.
[00:52.87]No.
[00:55.79]It's not fair.
[00:56.75]You didn't even knock me off.
[00:57.77]Oh, you can get hit by the signs.
[00:59.11]Did you see that?
[01:00.51]It's what hit me.
[01:01.58]All right, well, are you coming to me this time?
[01:03.64]No, I want to wait for the signs.
[01:05.12]I have a scary monster.

[02:00.33]Gang beast.

[05:43.52]You have to let go.
[05:44.42]No, you have to let go.
[05:45.36]All right.
[05:45.93]We're both going to let go at the same time.
[05:47.07]Ready?
[05:47.23]Okay.
[05:48.41]Go.
[05:48.53]I actually didn't even mean to let go.
[05:49.87]Am I pressing a button right now?
[05:51.79]Yes.
[05:53.77]Holy shit!
[05:56.25]Yay.
[05:56.65]Alright, you know the drill.
[05:57.93]At the very beginning, we dump the other guys off the edge.
[06:00.41]Yes, because they're absolutely playing this game.
[06:02.69]Yeah, look at these two guys playing this game.
[06:06.00]No, I wanna throw the- No, really?
[06:08.16]Are you serious?
[06:09.40]We were trying to throw those two off, and now we're both- I've got you, I've got you.
[06:12.46]No!
[06:12.86]No, I can't do anything.
[06:14.04]Can I, like, crawl?
[06:14.90]They're gonna beat us!
[06:16.00]No, no, hold on, I'm doing it.
[06:17.50]I'm doing, like, the crawl.
[06:19.52]Oh god, I let go.
[06:21.31]We just lost by two not-controlled players, by the way.
[06:23.65]They're just blinking at each other.
[06:25.37]They're not going to do anything.
[06:27.02]This is going to go on forever.
[06:29.06]We have to, like, end task on the game, because there's no pause.
[06:31.58]Yeah, we have to end task.
[06:33.08]You have to alt-F4, because there's no pause.
[06:35.20]There's no... Later.
[06:37.34]It's six o'clock, coming down.
[06:39.58]We've got a train coming, and it's going to take you to Boylston, and you want to get on that train.
[06:44.91]You want to make sure you...
[06:46.78]Wow, I thought it was coming.
[06:48.48]If I would have pushed you in front of the... You need to help me up.
[06:51.08]Give me your hand.
[06:51.64]Really.
[06:52.27]Give me your hand.
[06:52.77]I don't want to get hit by this friend.
[06:54.43]Can you, like, reach your hand out and pull me up?
[06:57.11]Pull me up.
[06:58.31]Yes!
[06:59.41]Yes!
[07:01.88]That's awesome.
[07:03.36]Oh, look!
[07:07.01]I'll come save you!
[07:08.13]I'll come save you!
[07:10.60]Yeah, once the train, once you see the lights on the train, that is when we have to try to escape, okay?
[07:15.50]Okay.
[07:15.86]I'm already, I'm ready.
[07:17.40]We have to stand back here.
[07:19.18]You have to run for it.
[07:19.94]Alright, you have to run for it.
[07:20.86]Good idea, good idea.
[07:21.92]Once the train comes, once you see the lights, we have to make our way back up to the platform.
[07:26.34]Okay.
[07:26.54]And whoever makes it up there wins.
