[00:09.90]Can you please just tell the star's apartment is a jungle story?
[00:15.16]The star's apartment is a jungle story for your video.
[00:17.93]Yeah.
[00:20.37]Dude, this king is... This century is getting so many... No!
[00:23.77]He's back!
[00:26.22]God damn it!
[00:27.16]I was too busy, like, paying attention to you, a fucking stupid jungle bathroom!
[00:30.75]And I fucking died.
[00:31.19]You're the one who brought up the jungle bathroom!
[00:33.11]I just told- I just told the story.
[00:35.33]All the steam is gone for the story.
[00:39.01]Dude, this sentry was getting so many kills, and I was just like, oh, tell that story!
[00:42.23]And I wasn't even paying any attention.
[00:43.63]I was paying attention to the story.
[00:45.93]I wasn't telling it.
[00:46.95]Yeah, but I was, like, paying attention to the notion that you were going to tell the story.
[00:50.56]That's it.
[00:50.82]I was just sitting there whacking the gun.
[00:55.48]Alright.
[00:56.70]Everybody wants to know this.
[00:58.89]I want to know.
[00:59.43]I'm sure the viewers wants to know.
[01:02.53]Star.
[01:04.31]How- where did it all begin?
[01:06.05]I was born in New Jersey.
[01:10.74]New Jersey!
[01:12.74]Oh no!
[01:13.22]He was born in New fucking Jersey!
[01:22.13]Somebody please go to have a medic.
[01:25.09]No, I got a medic.
[01:26.33]You think your Unusual's gonna save you?
[01:28.37]You think you're like, oh, see, your Unusual didn't save you.
[01:33.20]Didn't save you!
[01:35.76]Sorry.
[01:36.60]That's a bad idea to be taunting.
[01:38.64]Bad idea.
[01:42.02]Bad.
[01:43.13]Hold on, wait a second, I can't mess this up.
[01:47.64]Bad idea.
[01:48.16]Don't you dare taunt.
[01:49.18]Don't like taunt and then get chased for like 30 seconds and have the guy with a guaranteed kill.
[01:54.30]Where did this taunt all begin?
[01:56.38]Where did this taunt begin?
[01:57.60]Well, I'll tell you.
[02:00.97]It started all down in New Jersey.
[02:04.89]Everybody was taunting.
[02:07.77]Everybody was taunting down in Jersey.
[02:10.33]You should have seen them.
[02:12.33]Plymouth Rock.
[02:14.36]He's in, like, Pennsylvania or something.
[02:16.60]No, Plymouth Rock's in Plymouth, Massachusetts, you fucking idiot!
[02:20.40]I've never been to Massachusetts.
[02:24.76]How did I get back here, by the way?
[02:27.43]I don't know, I'm not even playing the game.
[02:28.93]How did I get back here?
[02:30.79]Guys, I've been sitting here just laughing, and me and Starbridge been being wicked stupid.
[02:34.15]How did I even get back here?
[02:35.75]Look what the card is!
[02:37.07]What did I do?
[02:39.26]What did I do?
[02:40.14]I'm at their spawn on upward, all the way at the back, and they're at the second point.
[02:44.96]It all started in New Jersey.
[02:47.74]Where did it all start for you?
[02:49.60]New Jersey!
[02:55.10]Star, I know exactly what I want to do.
[02:57.76]So, get your ass in the game, like, right now.
[03:02.52]Okay, there's three spies on this team.
[03:04.52]Okay, that's fine.
[03:06.17]I'm the fourth.
[03:07.52]That's great.
[03:08.16]Just letting you know, so you don't, like... Your job is to get back to red spawn.
[03:13.09]Like, all the way back.
[03:16.47]Oh, like, back to the future?
[03:20.49]Oh, I wonder who that medic is.
[03:23.33]This engineer is paying so much attention to, like, what I'm doing.
[03:26.07]He's like, what the hell is this guy doing?
[03:27.75]Wait, wait, that must be your spy!
[03:31.09]No, he doesn't know you're a spy.
[03:33.23]I'm just gonna, like, stair-stab the shit out of him, too.
[03:35.69]Just come over here.
[03:40.02]No, one on the left.
[03:41.24]Yeah.
[03:41.46]One down.
[03:41.86]Alright, now take your disguise off.
[03:48.93]That one's gonna spawn.
[03:49.69]Oh, damn it, dude!
[03:50.59]This is... No!
[03:52.55]Kill him!
[03:52.91]This guy... Hey, kill him!
[03:55.27]This is so stupid!
[04:00.34]Why are we doing this?
[04:01.46]Why is this the thing we're doing?
[04:05.26]Alright, he's... This is that same Engineer.
[04:10.46]Dude.
[04:11.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:12.56]Is there another spy?
[04:13.30]Is that another spy?
[04:15.08]I'm so confused right now.
[04:16.32]Hold on, I gotta go look.
[04:19.29]Yeah, that's a spy.
[04:20.45]Wait.
[04:20.63]There's a cloaked spy behind you, behind you, behind you!
[04:22.39]Oh my god!
[04:27.53]No!
[04:29.07]You suck!
[04:30.39]You got yourself killed by him!
[04:35.41]Yes!
[04:38.67]I'm sorry!
[04:39.61]I thought this was a dumb idea, but I forgot, like, the Jerma factor.
[04:43.13]No, you're not gonna, like, hit it as soon as I show up?
[04:47.41]No, I didn't, I, that was, unnecessarily, I did not mean to do that.
[04:53.20]Oh, look who it is.
[04:53.90]Okay, you need to get to her.
[04:56.82]No, I don't trust you.
[04:58.84]I'm, look, I promise you.
[05:00.46]Okay, okay, that was a little bit scary with the turn.
[05:02.42]Oh, you're, like, whole team spawning here now.
[05:04.26]Yeah.
[05:05.71]so go hide in like a place like just do no oh no why I don't understand what we're doing no just disguise as an engineer and just walk over to that guy just get in front of him I want to try to box okay do you see this engineer which one down to the down down spawn down at their spawn he we can literally lock him in
[05:32.36]I don't think he'll know what's going on.
[05:34.81]You get on that side, I'm gonna get on this side, so he can't move.
[05:39.69]He's stuck.
[05:39.99]He doesn't care!
[05:46.43]He's completely locked in.
[05:49.27]He's confused, he's like, what's going on here?
[05:51.23]Why can I not move?
[05:53.57]This is confusing me!
[05:57.48]This guy... Get out of the way!
[05:59.60]He's saying, get out of the way.
[06:01.14]In chat.
