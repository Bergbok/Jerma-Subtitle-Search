[00:02.26]No, I can't find a fucking pair of pants.
[00:05.67]Why?
[00:05.97]It doesn't make any sense.
[00:09.43]Do I not have any pants?
[00:11.83]How do I not have a pair of pants?
[00:18.64]I'm not looking, no, look, I'm not looking over here.
[00:20.40]Look, listen.
[00:22.74]All right, give me this.
[00:24.10]Give me this goddamn fucking forsaken thing.
[00:27.96]Give me this godforsaken thing.
[00:35.51]This should work.
[00:35.97]At least I hope it will.
[00:38.15]Just trying to plug some stuff in.
[00:39.41]Look, we got a curveball.
[00:42.25]That's alright.
[00:45.39]And I dropped it behind the desk.
[00:47.03]And it's gone.
[00:48.05]That's fucking great.
[00:50.85]I had to like plug in the stupid fucking camera for the PS... Whatever the fuck.
[00:58.07]It's not even gonna work, is it?
[00:58.95]Because it's not even the right fucking USB.
[01:01.21]UGH!
[01:08.60]Where is it?
[01:10.24]Get over here.
[01:12.66]Is this it?
[01:13.84]Is this it?
[01:14.24]I'm just looking for a USB.
[01:19.87]I just need a USB that's the correct USB.
[01:23.81]That's all I want, Mom.
[01:26.35]Dad.
[01:26.77]Because I can't connect this fucking thing unless it's the correct mini USB.
[01:40.70]There it is.
[01:41.86]Jesus.
[01:43.96]I can't find pants.
[01:45.20]I can't wear pants, apparently.
[01:47.18]I don't know where any of my plugs are.
[01:48.68]I just want to play sorcery.
[01:52.53]The game probably sucks.
[01:55.43]Dualshock 4, Dualshock 3.
[01:59.03]Dualsharknado.
[02:00.59]Like, what the fuck?
[02:03.05]I just want to play video games with my friends.
[02:07.59]Alright, here we go.
[02:09.37]Now I'm connected.
[02:15.99]Yes!
[02:16.95]Yaha!
[02:21.11]This should work.
[02:22.69]At least I'm praying it will.
[02:28.28]Okay.
[02:29.94]I'll just turn this back on so you don't just stare at a BRB screen.
[02:37.52]Let's just get this to... Yep.
[02:47.62]This is so fucked up.
[02:48.76]Alright, hold on.
[02:50.52]I want to do something.
[02:52.18]Don't make fun of my fucking pants.
[02:53.64]Look.
[02:55.91]This is what I'm wearing.
[02:56.85]This is why I needed to find a pair of pants and I don't.
[02:59.29]I have these weird Lifesavers shorts on.
[03:04.69]Don't get angry at me for that.
[03:08.60]Alright, let me... Why the fuck is this not working?
[03:16.12]Get turned on.
[03:18.75]You're not going to turn on.
[03:23.13]There we go.
[03:24.03]Holy shit.
[03:24.77]Alright, so here's what we're going to do.
[03:31.57]Pay no attention to the sounds you're going to hear in the background.
[03:39.83]Come on.
[03:46.42]You ready?
[03:47.04]This is going to be crazy.
[03:51.63]Let's go like this.
[03:58.86]I'm going to make it delay even more.
[04:00.18]Ready?
[04:00.36]Let's do 30 seconds.
[04:04.10]Let's see what happens.
[04:16.89]I might fuck up my whole stream, by the way.
[04:33.63]But that's the most I can do.
[04:53.59]I can't even tell.
[05:04.02]What's happening?
[05:07.54]Where am I?
[05:10.94]Oh no, this is getting in the way.
[05:14.29]What's happening first?
[05:16.51]I can't monitor the situation.
[05:21.77]Oh boy, this is gonna fall.
[05:24.31]This is gonna actually fall.
[05:29.48]I feel like a crash.
[05:47.01]okay we're good all right uh I'm ready no undo the umbrella I just got 12 years of bad luck so the audio is happening first so we'll fix that I'm gonna make the audio happen after so let's have let's do this
[06:18.41]And then this.
[06:46.50]What do you think you're doing here?
[06:56.29]Give me my headphones back.
[07:05.82]Only six seconds?!
[07:12.68]I can't tell!
[07:13.32]Hold on, let's try this again.
[07:16.36]I don't think I can do more than 9,000 milliseconds.
[07:23.07]So let's try to do like 20,000 milliseconds.
[07:30.85]I love people actually asking questions.
[07:35.11]I want my money back.
[07:37.75]But we only have 41% on the install.
[07:51.87]No, you can't do more than that.
[08:01.73]Let's do this.
[08:07.79]Hello!
[08:10.94]Why am I doing this?
[08:11.72]Because I'm waiting for the install.
[08:17.26]Plus or minus the delay.
[08:22.18]Is this something I can crunch?
[08:25.71]No, I can't crunch this.
[08:28.49]Imagine this is your first stream ever.
[08:33.78]Alright, hold on, let's do, wait.
[08:55.40]Oh, shit.
[08:57.48]Oh, shit is right.
[08:58.65]Oops.
[08:59.85]Oh.
[09:03.46]Whoops.
[09:04.42]Okay, alright.
[09:15.36]Is this as fucking, is this as funny as I hope it is?
[09:21.48]What is even real?
[09:22.62]Alright, I'm gonna fix it.
[09:29.52]We're almost done, hold on.
[09:51.54]I have a fucking, I have an idea.
[09:55.22]Listen to me.
[09:55.76]Listen, this is really important.
[10:00.17]I gotta, I gotta wait 10 seconds.
[10:01.27]So, how long is it?
[10:04.55]Okay, ready?
[10:05.11]How, somebody count.
[10:06.41]Somebody count.
[10:06.99]Count.
[10:07.23]Ready?
[10:08.75]From the time that you see this image to the, when you hear the clap.
[10:15.39]Listen, listen.
[10:16.77]How, how much time, how much time between clap and here, okay?
[10:22.46]10?
[10:31.96]So it's 10, it's 10, okay?
[10:39.73]10 seconds?
[10:43.59]Watch this.

[10:51.48]None of you will ever see my strength at its fullest potential.
[10:55.11]You are dead to me.
[10:56.27]I will kill you with my super ray.
[10:58.49]Did it work?
[11:19.21]It's still behind?
[11:27.22]Alright, one more time.
[11:35.65]You think your strength will match my strength?
[11:38.03]I don't think so!
[11:38.81]I am the master of strength!
[12:06.26]It's way off.
[12:12.78]Stop it.
[12:13.90]One second off?
[12:16.69]Too fast.

[15:39.59]Let me fix this.
[15:43.11]We're at 99%.
[15:43.41]I don't even know how this game works.
[15:44.95]The PlayStation cameras aren't even in the right spot.
[15:47.52]I think, does it have to be in the right spot?
[15:55.12]Come on, get over there.
[15:55.86]As long as it's in the general direction, I think I'm going to be fine.
[16:02.24]Whoa, get down.
[16:03.86]Okay, that should be okay.
[16:06.68]I think I only need one of these.
[16:08.16]At least I hope I do.
[16:12.06]Audio's a little early.
[16:12.90]It shouldn't be.
[16:18.59]Let's do this.
[16:26.91]So you can actually see my fucking ugly face.
[16:38.23]I was doing that in like total darkness.
[16:39.75]I'm realizing this now.
[16:40.53]All right, so how does this work?
[16:54.03]Control, please connect to PlayStation Move navigation controller.
[16:58.03]It's lit up.
[17:01.83]What, someone's making fun of my hair again?
[17:03.03]I guess, don't you understand?
[17:05.31]My hair, like, just sucks.
[17:06.77]It sucks shit.
[17:09.03]I was going to say something else.
[17:10.37]Good thing I didn't.
[17:10.93]All right, connect this to, please, thank you.
[17:15.71]It's lit up.
[17:22.65]Now what?
[17:24.48]Now what is your problem?
[17:31.20]What is the controller?
[17:31.96]What is this other controller?
[17:34.70]Controller seven.
[17:38.14]What are you talking about, man?
[17:40.14]Seven?
[17:40.50]I don't have seven controllers plugged in.
[17:51.35]Let's quit game.
[17:51.95]Let's open it again.
[17:53.41]Give me a second.
[18:05.92]Alright, now this should work.
[18:07.80]At least I hope it does.
[18:08.58]I'm going to change this to Sorcery.
[18:13.08]This is not Drunk Drug Batman 2.
[18:18.13]Magic moves.
[18:18.87]I don't know.
[18:19.17]I don't know what this game is.
[18:25.30]Look at this shit.
[18:26.04]It's going crazy.
[18:28.02]Sorcery.
[18:31.40]Is this supposed to be happening?
[18:37.06]What the fuck?
[18:49.17]How do you not get this?
[18:56.02]Whoa, look, did you see that?
[19:04.73]We just got, I'm right there.
[19:06.55]I'm right there, I was, I'm there.
[19:28.60]Try standing.
[19:31.16]I don't think that's the problem.
[19:40.79]Please connect to control.
[19:42.13]I'm going to have to restart the goddamn computer.
[19:44.17]The system, whatever the fuck this thing is.
[19:49.03]Old man can't understand technology.
[19:50.49]That's not what's going on.
[19:53.31]We're going to reboot the system.
[19:54.81]Oh my God.
[19:55.38]Remember the thing I did when I was clapping and shit?
[20:04.21]Old technology, man.
[20:06.58]That is true.
[20:06.98]I don't want to stand because I don't have proper pants on.
[20:14.04]I'm looking at this camera.
[20:17.03]Incorrect.
[20:18.19]Fucking incorrect.
[20:19.41]Don't look at this one.
[20:20.11]Look at this one.
[20:20.59]This is the one that actually has the red light on it.
[20:22.03]That means it's working.
[20:26.29]There are two different types of move controllers.
[20:28.29]No, this is PlayStation 3, dude.
[20:30.61]This is a PlayStation 3 move controller.
[20:32.91]I can go plug another.
[20:33.73]Maybe this one's like broken.
[20:36.09]I wouldn't be surprised.
[20:36.80]I'd like to throw these and shit and drop them like a funny streamer.
[20:39.96]I'd like to drop them and like, I'd throw them.
[20:42.28]Have I done that?
[20:43.82]This camera.
[20:45.26]This one.
[20:47.30]Have I ever done that?
[20:54.21]I don't think I've ever done that.
[20:56.93]Okay, so... I think this thing... I think this thing's broken.
[21:06.14]I'm gonna get the other one.
[21:10.12]Here we... Maybe that one's, like, fucked up or something.
[21:15.46]I don't know.
[21:17.50]I wouldn't be surprised.
