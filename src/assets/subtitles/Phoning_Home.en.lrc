[01:37.30]Hi, hi everybody.
[01:38.07]Today we're going to play Wall-E Phones Home.
[01:43.27]Watch your ears.
[01:43.83]No, you don't have to watch your ears.
[01:44.89]I lied.
[01:45.32]Don't worry about that.
[01:45.96]Everything's going to be okay.
[01:49.80]A little irritated today.
[01:52.09]Didn't wake up on the wrong side of the bed.
[01:53.21]Had a pretty good day, actually.
[01:54.87]Had a very good day.
[01:57.41]I'm thinking about E3.
[01:58.43]It's going to be fun.
[02:00.69]It's coming up this Monday, Tuesday time.
[02:03.98]But a little irritated by a couple of things.
[02:06.20]Just a slight irritation of a few things very specifically.
[02:08.62]We'll go over them real quickly.
[02:11.00]If you weren't here earlier, you may not have been here.
[02:13.94]Maybe like 15, 20 minutes ago.
[02:17.56]We had a poll.
[02:19.25]That poll was designed for you guys to vote on the game we were going to play.
[02:23.13]I had two games that we narrowed it down to.
[02:25.83]And one of them was not the one I'm playing right now.
[02:28.43]It was not this one.
[02:30.03]Let's go ahead and switch over just so we're done with the intro.
[02:33.23]Put the fucking music on.
[02:34.29]The nice fucking music.
[02:36.76]Put on the nice fucking music.
[02:39.62]So it wasn't supposed to be this.
[02:40.98]This one didn't win.
[02:42.74]The Saboteur one.
[02:44.82]I bought the Saboteur on goodoldgames.com.
[02:49.00]Which, you know, it has its own launcher.
[02:51.22]It has its own emulation software built into the game.
[02:55.24]They have DOS boxes pretty much built in to make sure it works.
[02:58.88]It don't fucking work.
[03:00.74]It just doesn't open.
[03:02.78]So, don't worry.
[03:04.10]It's okay.
[03:05.02]If a German tries to play games that are fucking more than five years old, they don't open.
[03:08.88]No matter what I do.
[03:10.26]Like, God seriously looks down every time I fucking buy a game that's more than five years old and goes, Good luck, dickhead!
[03:16.73]And fucking, like, throws a lightning bolt down, and then, like, Loki's the fucking backstabs me, just like in Smite, and that game sucks.
[03:23.23]No, it doesn't.
[03:23.65]That game's fine.
[03:24.17]That game's fine.
[03:24.63]You'll like that game.
[03:25.29]Go get it.
[03:25.61]Go play Smite if you like it.
[03:26.63]It's a fucking top-down... I mean, all the top-down fucking League of Legends games that people like for no reason.
[03:32.43]That people pretend to like because they think it's cool.
[03:36.63]Well, play the one that's the third-person one.
[03:38.72]Smite.
[03:39.06]Smite.com.
[03:39.98]Smitegame.com.
[03:40.86]Check it out.
[03:43.54]All right.
[03:45.52]We're ready to go.
[03:48.01]This game might not be any good.
[03:49.57]That's my point.
[03:50.27]I'm like scared.
[03:51.51]This game might not fucking be good.
[03:52.94]But by the way, hold on a second.
[03:54.04]We're on extreme quality level.
[03:57.26]Just want to make sure you guys are aware of that.
[04:00.36]Controls, I'm sure I'll learn.
[04:01.60]This is phoning home.
[04:02.59]This game's going to flag out.
[04:04.91]There is no next.
[04:05.71]Actually, there is a next.
[04:06.95]There is a next.
[04:07.95]There are two nexts.
[04:10.24]And at this point... Shut up, bird.
[04:13.12]At this point, I, like, don't care.
[04:15.58]Like, what happens after this.
[04:16.96]Because, like, I already got really irritated with the whole fucking saboteur thing.
[04:19.44]That game looked really fun.
[04:22.00]Uh, wait, there's Ultimate Battle Epic Simulator.
[04:24.31]Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator came out with its 1.0 update.
[04:29.15]So, there's that.
[04:30.01]They added some stuff.
[04:31.77]Apparently, it might be worth checking out.
[04:33.27]And then there's also Sniper Ghost Wolf 3.
[04:36.51]Sniper Ghost Wolf 3 is still... Sniper Ghost Warrior 3.
[04:40.55]It is still an option.
[04:42.35]Even though nobody... None of you want me to fucking play it.
[04:49.56]So, I mean, there's that.
[04:51.72]There are a couple of next options.
[04:59.59]Oh, let me just make a tweet.
[05:04.57]And there it is.
[05:11.24]Sniper series sucks We'll see how far we get in this I'm not gonna judge I went into this tonight was gonna be pretty open and we're just gonna be just chillin and playing it for a few hours You know how it is Holy shit, somebody just gave fi- What's with the explosions?
[05:28.80]SticksRenegade just gave 50 fucking dollars
[05:32.25]Thanks a lot, Stix Renegade.
[05:34.21]Don't worry, we come to these streams for you.
[05:35.77]At least I do, not for the games.
[05:37.01]You can even just pick your fucking nose for hours and I will watch it.
[05:41.87]I will watch because you're the best.
[05:44.39]Well, Stix, that's very, very kind of you.
[05:47.43]But even still, I don't want my streams to not be...
[05:53.98]Boring I'm not a boring guy and even a very high energy person so like I get I don't want to be boring You want to watch a boring stream?
[06:02.85]I'll give you a couple of fucking names that you could go watch one of them's Vinnie God damn it.
[06:07.85]I'm sorry.
[06:08.25]I was a joke that was a callback to like fucking four days ago That was a callback to like four days ago.
[06:14.89]That was a joke.
[06:15.45]It's a complete fabrication his stream is fucking fantastic Okay, like that was a fucking callback
[06:23.46]Don't worry.
[06:24.27]It was a joke.
[06:25.25]Vinny, if somebody links this to you, I still get like 12 seconds on the odd shot or the VOD or whatever.
[06:29.45]It was a joke.
[06:29.97]Fuck you.
[06:30.35]You're a good dude.
[06:31.47]We followed each other on Twitter.
[06:32.87]We just followed each other on Twitter.
[06:34.17]That's how you know we're cool.
[06:37.54]I don't think you guys even knew that.
[06:38.58]I mean, we followed each other on Twitter.
[06:40.66]That's a big fucking step in being like best fucking friends.
[06:43.38]You know what I mean?
[06:46.79]I don't get that reference.
[06:53.14]I love this, like, alright, here's something funny, though, about this whole thing.
[06:58.62]Like, I haven't, like, never, like, spoken to him.
[07:01.42]We went back and forth, just like, hey, what's up, dude?
[07:03.36]Hey, what's up, man?
[07:04.48]Like, that was it.
[07:05.34]That was, like, the extent of our, like, hey, what's going on, man?
[07:10.05]Following each other on Twitter, might as well be married.
[07:16.34]It was just a callback to the... You saw the fucking dumb shitty car crash stream that I did like last week.
[07:23.37]That was a callback joke.
[07:25.29]He's a swell guy.
[07:26.15]He's fucking funny and his streams are great.
[07:27.85]So don't worry about that.
[07:29.82]Alright, um, but thank you, Styx.
[07:31.72]Appreciate that.
[07:32.28]And also, Hole of One, let's just get a little, this is going to be a shitty opening cutscene, this is guaranteed, so let's just, let's talk over it.
[07:38.04]Uh, Reaper 500, thanks for the 500.
[07:40.80]This is loud, too.
[07:41.70]Ion, we are experiencing an irresistible gravitational pull.
[07:45.09]I don't know if you guys can hear me, but Reaper, thanks for the 500.
[07:47.35]Let me know that you are the only stripper that I ask to spend money on.
[07:50.09]This is not a simulation.
[07:50.99]Don't make me look bad.
[07:52.25]This is not a simulation.
[07:54.25]Dropping fuel reserves as per protocol.
[07:55.95]Thank you.
[07:59.98]He recalls fitting low energy and plans what I never said that I was kidding We're going there's no audio brace for impact This is just a wall-e ripoff Don't worry my stream sucks I
[08:32.61]Oh god, hold on.
[08:33.31]Hold on a second.
[08:34.97]It's very important.
[08:35.77]Thank you, Mr. Sandman, for the 10 bucks.
[08:37.02]They say, why have I given you 100 dollars?
[08:39.26]I don't know, man.
[08:54.45]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[08:55.43]Also, thank you, Hall of One Zombie, for the 15 bucks.
[08:59.09]Your perseverance don't... But don't still don't understand.
[09:02.28]Alright, what do I do?
[09:03.46]L to what?
[09:04.22]L is like the journal.
[09:05.16]Weaponize yourself.
[09:06.14]W, A, S, D is move.
[09:08.06]I do... Hold on.
[09:10.04]I do need... This is very important.
[09:13.46]I need... The sensitivity is way too high.
[09:20.47]I think it's probably in controls.
[09:22.95]It sure is.
[09:26.07]Uh, sensitivity... Yeah, yeah, move that way down.
[09:29.29]Okay, is that better?
[09:33.13]Yeah, that's better.
[09:37.43]Might be a little too low, but that's fine.
[09:39.12]Alright, so what do I do here?
[09:40.38]Walk off the plane?
[09:41.94]Pick up.
[09:42.52]E. Okay, that is better than nothing.
[09:47.48]Okay, I can... Apparently I have a fucking... I have a tuba.
[09:52.00]A mini tuba.
[09:52.90]I have a mini black tuba.
[09:57.69]Well, the mouth part of the tuba.
[09:59.88]What's that part?
[10:01.08]Does this hurt you?
[10:01.62]Can you get hurt in this game?
[10:03.54]Yes, you can.
[10:04.04]Alright, I'm just making sure.
[10:06.92]That noise is really annoying.
[10:08.22]Alright, what do I... There's fucking dinosaurs in this game.
[10:12.59]There's like giant pterodactyls.
[10:18.11]Okay, this game is... Everyone thought this game was going to be fucking boring.
[10:23.06]I don't know about that one, guys.
[10:24.56]This might be really, really interesting.
[10:28.04]Where do I go?
[10:29.40]Weaponize yourself.
[10:32.01]Power up fuel.
[10:32.97]Access crafting tools via the inventory.
[10:39.75]Yeah, that one.
[10:40.85]Activate.
[10:41.65]I don't have anything else.
[10:42.49]I wasn't really paying that much attention.
[10:44.37]Up here?
[10:46.21]Can you jump?
[10:50.63]I can hover, apparently.
[10:51.59]If I hold the button down.
[10:54.13]Okay, cool.
[10:56.01]Now look at this.
[10:57.67]I guess that is what they call life.
[11:00.25]Pretty atrocious stuff.
[11:02.37]Be careful.
[11:04.15]Huh?
[11:08.38]Is it fall damage?
[11:09.32]I hope not.
[11:09.86]You are almost out of fuel.
[11:12.04]Watch for mushrooms and flowers.
[11:15.58]Looks like it's crap fuel.
[11:19.30]Ion's reserves of fuel are very low and it needs to stuff up on it to run the thruster.
[11:24.27]I ordered the trainee to look out for mushrooms and flowers.
[11:26.89]I was just kidding about Vinny, by the way.
[11:28.37]Like, I was kidding.
[11:30.21]To collect the two ingredients we need.
[11:32.13]Two mitox and one seed.
[11:34.21]Without the thruster, Ion would face insurmountable difficulties in rocky terrain.
[11:37.76]Okay.
[11:37.92]Alright, unlocked fuel.
[11:44.26]Fuel, there it is.
[11:45.88]Refills 30% of the fuel for the thruster.
[11:47.80]Yeah.
[11:54.70]Don't tell him!
[11:55.44]Don't really tell him!
[12:00.22]It's gonna be so awkward when I see him at E3.
[12:02.90]And I like give him a high five.
[12:04.18]Is he even going to E3?
[12:05.50]I don't know.
[12:07.31]Maybe.
[12:09.65]I don't think I can... I don't have any items.
[12:11.47]I can't craft that yet.
[12:13.47]I'm assuming I'm gonna need like rocks and stones and shit.
[12:16.25]Oh, there are the mushrooms.
[12:21.98]Okay.
[12:23.52]Scan resource.
[12:25.10]Scanned matter categorized.
[12:27.23]Mitox.
[12:28.39]Part one of the fuel recipe.
[12:30.19]Cool.
[12:30.83]Now look for flowers.
[12:33.75]So this is, we gotta get the roses and we gotta get the mitox.
[12:36.21]Did you notice the symbols on your compass?
[12:38.99]Yeah.
[12:40.01]Once a resource is scanned, your compass will point to similar signatures.
[12:43.49]Cool.
[12:44.99]These are flowers, right?
[12:46.11]Variety is the key to learning about the planet.
[12:49.73]Keep exploring and identifying new resources.
[12:54.17]Okay, cool.
[12:56.01]So this is just Wall-E and what was that dumb space game that was like terrible and was fun for like 45 minutes and it was in development for like six years and everybody thought it was going to be the best game ever made and it turned out it was just kind of like crappy and you like scanned for resources and shit.
[13:10.36]What was that game?
[13:14.34]Skyland?
[13:15.14]No, Skyfall.
[13:17.08]What was it called?
[13:20.75]No Man's Sky.
[13:21.33]There it was.
[13:22.25]I'm going to get all these mushrooms.
[13:25.72]mobile unit agility status success a spark of hope still you are trying to kill the butterfly where are these aren't these are not flowers of your structural integrity avoid heat avoid aggressive life there there's some flowers avoid falling from great heights you can improve structural integrity with hull repairs or circuit perch there are the flowers extract those seeds matter categorized seeds
[13:56.07]Part two of the fuel recipe.
[13:58.37]Now check your inventory and craft some fuel.
[14:01.72]Okay.
[14:03.44]Craft some fuel.
[14:04.48]Okay.
[14:05.08]How do we craft fuel?
[14:07.94]Craft item.
[14:09.86]Make sure you always have enough fuel in store.
[14:13.66]Okay.
[14:14.38]And try finding other resources while I continue my analysis.
[14:18.03]Two of those.
[14:18.41]All right, cool.
[14:18.99]Got it.
[14:19.37]Watch for anything that catches your eye.
[14:22.13]So it is going, huh?
[14:24.69]Is there like a goal here?
[14:32.62]Why would there be rain on my screen?
[14:36.10]This is a third-person game.
[14:37.48]Wow.
[14:39.64]You can really, really pull out.
[14:42.24]Okay.
[14:42.38]Fix the circuitry.
[14:45.32]All right.
[14:59.46]So how do I learn how to do that?
[15:00.46]Circuit purge.
[15:01.80]Jetport inventory, collect the necessary resources, and craft that circuit purge.
[15:07.54]We need to phone home.
[15:11.16]He said the title, okay.
[15:12.76]So we need three of these squids.
[15:16.23]Two baby squids.
[15:18.97]One baby squid, three full grown squids.
[15:21.69]And two of my old intro from like 2011.
[15:26.53]As if the planet is sucking the water out of them.
[15:29.14]Okay, got it.
[15:30.14]Strain.
[15:32.92]Strain.
[15:36.02]Roll credits.
[15:43.48]It's kind of relaxing so far.
[15:44.84]I can't wait till I fight a dinosaur.
[15:46.32]It's going to be fun.
[15:50.88]All right.
[15:51.84]How much do I need?
[15:52.62]I need two of these.
[15:55.52]Where are these?
[15:58.54]Look out for tree stumps.
[16:01.81]Tree stumps.
[16:07.99]Hmm.
[16:09.87]Hmm.
[16:10.75]Hmm.
[16:13.29]Ooh, lightning!
[16:16.85]This is shit.
[16:17.65]Hey!
[16:18.77]Hold on, don't say that yet.
[16:19.95]What is this?
[16:20.39]What does that mean?
[16:25.11]Well, just, this is the tutorial.
[16:29.02]It's teaching us these things.
[16:32.16]This looks like a tree trunk.
[16:36.20]Let's go over here.
[16:39.08]How can a robot be out in the rain?
[16:40.22]That's a good question.
[16:44.69]Just wait.
[16:45.15]I'm going to be fighting dinosaurs.
[16:52.64]Game sucks.
[16:53.70]No, the game doesn't suck.
[16:55.30]You see what I have in my hand?
[16:58.38]There's fighting in this game.
[16:59.38]I have a weapon.
[16:59.96]I'm just going to watch out for the creepers.
[17:06.03]Oh, there we go.
[17:07.19]Oh, it's okay.
[17:07.73]This is the first obstacle.
[17:12.27]I thought you could hold it down forever, but you can't.
[17:14.35]Your structural integrity is below 50%.
[17:17.39]You should try to repair your hull and be more careful.
[17:22.82]I need to pick up the little squids.
[17:28.58]This entertainment media is insufficient.
[17:32.16]Just wait.
[17:33.08]It's gonna get... Just hold on a second.
[17:35.17]Stop reading chat.
[17:36.17]I have to read chat.
[17:37.39]That's my job, is to read chat.
[17:42.35]Don't you understand?
[17:42.87]This is just teaching us how to collect things.
[17:45.47]Okay, I need one of these little things.
[17:49.71]Look out for tree stumps.
[17:51.40]Where the hell is it?
[17:52.02]I need one tree stump.
[18:11.43]No tree stump here.
[18:18.39]Tree stump?
[18:20.47]No, this is like gold.
[18:22.96]What the hell is this?
[18:23.72]No.
[18:24.12]I can get the superconductive.
[18:31.41]My data predicted it, but it is usually produced in labs.
[18:35.24]We know of no other planet where it is safely lying around.
[18:37.80]You call your job being that of a kindergartner.
[18:39.88]What?
[18:40.18]Reading chat?
[18:42.02]What are you implying?
[18:44.63]There's a tree stump.
[18:50.19]Finally.
[18:51.25]Alright, good, good, good.
[18:54.37]Cool, now I can make it.
[18:55.13]Circuit purge, craft it.
[18:55.71]Okay, I got one.
[18:56.23]Got it.
[18:57.21]Got it complete.
[18:57.91]Need to make a call.
[18:58.47]No next, I don't want to see next yet.
[18:59.83]This game was 20 bucks, I'm getting my 20 dollars worth.
[19:03.17]That's one hour per dollar.
[19:26.35]So, you're gonna have to deal with it.
[19:29.75]One hour per dollar of time spent.
[19:32.65]I ain't... Wait, wait.
[19:33.83]Look, I'm gonna veto this.
[19:37.33]I have the executive order I can make to not do next.
[19:40.53]That doesn't matter.
[19:41.15]You guys can have like a... You guys can have like a fucking election referendum all you want.
[19:50.09]Keep like that election going.
[19:51.88]I ain't gonna fucking... I don't care.
[19:53.02]I don't care.
[19:57.25]Go through it!
[19:57.89]What the fuck?
[20:04.48]It's 30 minutes per dollar, everybody knows that.
[20:06.50]Alright, what do I have to do?
[20:07.42]Fix this leakage?
[20:08.10]We're ready to go.
[20:09.26]This hurts.
[20:10.86]My head.
[20:11.26]Alright, now... Do I have any drinks?
[20:26.08]We need to use your backup system.
[20:28.56]There is a small hilltop to the northwest.
[20:31.76]Okay, we gotta go get the backup.
[20:33.10]We gotta go call in full enforcement.
[20:35.26]Follow it.
[20:35.90]God, fuck.
[20:36.88]I seriously, like, keep thinking I have more than that.
[20:40.58]We're almost getting there, guys.
[20:41.44]Did you see that pterodactyl that flew overhead?
[20:45.22]Everyone's saying next.
[20:46.08]We haven't even gotten to the first boss.
[20:48.98]Always an interesting topic in resource discussions on P1.
[20:52.80]Do we really need those expensive backup systems?
[20:56.98]Yes, we need them.
[20:58.86]Without your long-wave transmitter, we would be lost right now.
[21:03.93]I'm going to get a gun and shit, probably.
[21:05.93]See?
[21:08.31]That was perfect.
[21:09.87]Alright, this way.
[21:13.93]Helping the onboard unit is a high point in the career of any young exploration unit.
[21:19.32]Why is this guy's name a fucking resolution setting?
[21:23.78]It's freaking me out.
[21:24.30]I keep thinking it's trying to change my resolution.
[21:29.93]Scan it.
[21:32.13]Look, here we go.
[21:36.82]See?
[21:37.46]Now we're at the cutscene.
[21:39.10]This is when, like, the mad dog is going to jump out of there.
[21:50.51]289 by 65.
[21:51.47]Yeah, that's some... That's some, like, 1975 resolution right there.
[21:56.77]Failed.
[21:57.65]P1 out of range.
[22:00.20]Alright, what was the point of that huge cutscene?
[22:03.32]Alright, what...
[22:12.70]That is a major setback.
[22:15.32]Our chance of safely returning home is down to 2.22%.
[22:19.02]See, I'm at like 2.2% completion.
[22:21.32]Game time.
[22:21.68]It looks like we need more power for our radio unit.
[22:24.96]Let me finish my analysis.
[22:26.32]Here it goes.
[22:26.82]It's gonna go... In the meantime, it cannot hurt to collect more and varied resources.
[22:31.49]Watch out, Wally!
[22:33.23]Protect yourself from the... The Tetra!
[22:36.27]The Tetra Dactyl!
[22:37.69]It's gonna swoop in and be like...
[22:42.57]I guarantee you.
[22:44.05]I bet you $1,000.
[22:45.01]I bet you $1,000 that it's gonna go... Refund?
[22:57.52]No!
[22:58.18]I'm not done.
[23:04.42]Ion, would you please slowly count to 10?
[23:07.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[23:13.51]How do I count?
[23:16.75]What's going on?
[23:17.29]And so he's gonna shut off and it's gonna be like, oh no, where am I supposed to go?
[23:29.06]He ran out of juice.
[23:29.64]He ran out of power.
[23:40.18]Full check complete.
[23:42.38]As you might have guessed, we have a lot of work ahead of us, Ion.
[23:47.16]Highest priority.
[23:48.64]There is an emergency signal to the south.
[23:51.03]Find the source.
[23:53.25]You got it.
[23:53.53]Let's get some fuel.
[23:54.99]There is an old radio mast on a hilltop to the south.
[23:58.91]I set a marker on your compass.
[24:00.65]That's 200 fucking feet away.
[24:02.17]Let's check it out and see if we can use it.
[24:04.35]That's not that far.
[24:05.19]A little thruster exercise for you.
[24:07.64]We're doing exercises.
[24:08.72]Stop it.
[24:09.62]Stop saying next.
[24:11.46]Emergency next.
[24:16.22]Not every stream has to be a funny stream.
[24:19.29]This is a play game and survive as Wally stream.
[24:24.05]Not every stream has to be funny.
[24:28.67]Every single stream doesn't have to be comedy.
[24:30.49]We're just playing the game.
[24:32.19]Wally... I don't even know the name of the game.
[24:33.51]Check your inventory for a teleporter.
[24:35.39]Surface scanning shows you will need one.
[24:38.85]Wait, check your inventory for what?
[24:41.54]Teleporter?
[24:44.60]Hole repair.
[24:45.60]Use hole repair to increase structural integrity.
[24:49.62]I did it.
[24:50.54]Okay, I can do it on my own.
[24:53.06]Fuel teleporter.
[24:54.24]80 charges, okay.
[25:03.30]Teleport to the next game.
[25:06.82]No.
[25:08.22]Let's see what it is.
[25:09.80]We have to see.
[25:10.58]You guys really want me to move to the next game?
[25:15.48]It's Ghost Wolf.
[25:16.81]Sniper Ghost Wolf 3.
[25:20.74]sniper ghost warrior 3 is like the next game you understand that right you want me to next to that fucking game that will be big news yeah I'm looking at the chat right now people are saying no don't do that completely defunct too bad we could have used it but I do detect a possible path to the south see look at the lava has been set on your compass go there
[25:47.88]I'm not, I don't hate this.
[25:49.00]This is not, I don't, I'm not, not enjoying this.
[25:53.81]The canyon is too deep.
[25:56.07]No chance to cross it without a teleporter.
[25:58.77]What?
[26:00.77]You better build one.
[26:02.03]Alright, I need, how do I, I need five of these, three of these.
[26:04.25]What the hell are these?
[26:05.75]Cronos?
[26:06.91]Creonobles?
[26:08.32]And crystals.
[26:10.68]Where the fuck do I get these?
[26:12.88]Where am I supposed to get these from?
[26:14.60]You're telling me I can't make that jump?
[26:16.68]Bullshit, I can.
[26:28.66]Ion, I can't read your signal.
[26:32.08]Ion, please report back.
[26:36.54]A gas that usually requires extreme pressure just to exist.
[26:41.39]Where am I?
[26:42.53]Creonobl and photonics outside of a lab.
[26:46.45]That will be big news on P1, Ion.
[26:49.09]We must phone home.
[26:51.45]It's okay, it's okay.
[26:52.13]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[26:53.91]No, we're not nexting yet.
[26:56.89]Not until we get to see the first enemy of the game.
[27:03.41]Look, we're right here.
[27:03.99]Everything's fine.
[27:05.32]Yeah, we're good.
[27:06.36]Alright, where can I go here?
[27:08.72]Yeah, I know.
[27:09.28]I need the teleporter.
[27:10.78]I need the crate.
[27:12.44]Give me a second.
[27:13.10]The first enemy was the ground you couldn't walk on.
[27:16.40]I know.
[27:28.16]Here we go.
[27:28.70]Now I get these tubes.
[27:31.66]Pick up some of this stuff.
[27:38.28]You guys are harsh tonight.
[27:41.22]We don't even know how the game is.
[27:45.26]Go back to the next game until they're begging.
[27:47.00]You guys are going to be begging me to come back to Wali when we open Sniper Ghost Warrior 3.
[28:00.69]Hey Jerma, fuck you.
[28:02.29]That one.
[28:04.39]This is a guy in the chat that just goes, hey, hey, fuck you.
[28:09.16]I'm sorry.
[28:10.18]I'm sorry.
[28:11.00]What the hell?
[28:12.46]I'm just trying to have fun in my fucking WALL-E game.
[28:17.54]Why is everybody so mad?
[28:19.51]I'm sorry.
[28:20.19]I'm like having fun with the cute WALL-E thruster game.
[28:25.93]Using sprint mode requires energy.
[28:28.44]Your batteries are below 75%.
[28:30.30]I just need a couple of crystals.
[28:31.44]Sooner or later, you will need to recharge them.
[28:34.50]Have fun on your own time.
[28:38.12]I will.
[28:39.12]Power cell unlocked.
[28:40.74]What the hell is this?
[28:45.31]Okay.
[28:46.09]No, I don't want that.
[28:48.01]We need a teleporter.
[28:48.71]We need two crystals.
[28:51.17]Where the hell am I gonna get these?
[28:58.49]Once we get out of the tutorial, we'll figure out if this is the next situation.
[29:03.81]I know a lot of you guys say it is already.
[29:07.47]But I don't necessarily believe that yet.
[29:09.87]Not yet.
[29:17.40]Once the pterodactyl flew over, you guys knew.
[29:19.12]Come on.
[29:25.50]Spore for a year?
[29:29.96]This entire game is a tutorial?
[29:34.90]Is it raining at my house, too?
[29:37.49]Okay, bye-bye.
[29:45.85]No crystals.
[29:50.21]Play Trials Fusion.
[29:51.19]Trials Fusion is fun.
[29:54.38]I'm gonna re-re-fun this game.
[29:57.66]You need to refill your tanks.
[30:00.00]But where are the crystals?
[30:04.64]Where are the crystals?
[30:07.94]But where is Dr. Wily?
[30:09.66]That's a good question.
[30:12.05]We may be able to order it in the radar room.
[30:15.91]And we'll find Dr. Wily.
[30:16.77]Okay, um...
[30:25.98]Listen, guys, we may be able to find a, um... A, uh... Shows at the top of the crystals.
[30:33.64]I think you have to, like, find them first.
[30:35.86]Before it shows up on the radar.
[30:37.83]You know, like, we may be able to find those, uh, crystals.
[30:41.79]When we find those crystals, we'll find Dr. Ali.
[30:53.32]You guys are so harsh.
[30:55.14]You guys are so harsh tonight.
[30:59.76]Oh, terrible, boring, awful.
[31:01.84]Jesus.
[31:03.70]We're not even like 30 minutes in.
[31:05.16]We just need to find a crystal.
[31:16.78]Find him in the next game.
[31:17.88]Alright, I mean...
[31:24.21]Yeah, alright.
[31:26.33]Wait, what?
[31:30.35]We have to fight one enemy before we go.
[31:33.39]Very important.
[31:35.18]I'm getting burnt apparently.
[31:38.86]Oh, shut up.
[31:40.04]I know.
[31:40.36]I know.
[31:40.70]Just level this heal, who cares.
[31:57.40]Just play subnautica?
[31:59.67]It doesn't have a cute character label.
[32:02.39]There are no enemies?
[32:04.57]So what was that?
[32:05.05]Just that giant pterodactyl in the beginning?
[32:07.63]Then where is a fucking crystal?
[32:11.00]Now I am getting kind of angry.
[32:13.44]Why wouldn't there be like a crystal really close?
[32:27.83]Like, you think if I have to find a crystal, I have to find one.
[32:32.25]To continue to play the very beginning of the game.
[32:34.90]That they would put them fucking everywhere.
[32:40.68]Where the hell would they be?
[32:44.64]That was an advanced civilization.
[32:47.37]We are not the first visitors, Ion.
[32:50.61]Wonder why they vanished.
[32:51.61]But maybe they're still around.
[32:55.02]Careful, that's not what I want style.
[32:57.48]That's not what I wanted Scanned matter categorized unknown.
[33:02.38]It's just like dark matter centuries filed under black residue analysis initiated Only gonna give us a few more minutes to find the you have to find this item.
[33:15.70]That's not going to be very good The black residue is a natural high-frequency transistor Exactly what we need it doesn't say
[33:25.48]All the strange stuff on this planet.
[33:28.19]The other ones say where they're from, right?
[33:29.81]And that black residue.
[33:33.31]There's something very special about this place.
[33:37.15]Very strange.
[33:39.21]And very dangerous.
[33:41.79]He better not find us.
[33:49.01]It's near the mission?
[33:51.06]Guys, guys.
[33:52.42]You have to find...
[33:54.82]and scan the crystal before it shows up on the compass.
[33:59.32]I've not found and scanned it yet.
[34:03.02]You have to find it first.
[34:14.38]Did I not just pass the crystal?
[34:16.42]I don't think so.
[34:29.90]Fucking E.T.
[34:30.70]phone home.
[34:31.96]You gonna fill a landfill with this one too?
[34:33.78]Oh my god.
[34:40.39]I can't even- I don't even have- I have no fuel.
[34:50.04]Anybody see a crystal?
[34:58.25]What the fuck is a goddamn crystal?
[35:03.84]What is this?
[35:05.26]First enemy.
[35:05.98]I told you all we need to... No, it's not an enemy.
[35:07.54]That's a fucking tube.
[35:08.72]That's just... That's a tree trunk.
[35:09.90]Okay.
[35:15.26]I see one sniper ghost warrior.
[35:27.00]And now I need, like, I... First enemy.
[35:31.78]Yeah, tree.
[35:34.02]Hold on a second.
[35:35.95]Like, honest to fucking God.
[35:38.21]Give me one second.
[35:39.55]I'm just gonna go to, like... Shouldn't they just be here?
[35:41.71]Crystal.
[35:54.69]Alright, it's gonna tell me, oh, it's broken.
[35:56.25]Okay, I can't go this way.
[35:57.55]So, like, is that it over there?
[35:59.59]Like, the purple shit?
[36:00.95]But I can't go over there.
[36:02.37]But I do detect a possible path to the south.
[36:05.75]A new marker has been set on your compass.
[36:08.65]Go there.
[36:09.73]Yeah, okay.
[36:10.22]And it's gonna say, you can't do it, but those purple things look like they would be crystals, don't you think?
[36:15.30]That canyon is too deep.
[36:17.56]No chance to cross it without a teleporter.
[36:22.28]You better build one.
[36:26.38]Okay.
[36:27.62]So, like, you have to assume that the crystals would be, like, over here somewhere.
[36:34.51]I can't go around the canyon.
[36:35.79]He just told me I have to teleport over this.
[36:43.19]I mean, like, can't I just go the long way?
[36:47.04]Is that a threat?
[36:48.44]You have to build one.
[36:54.34]Try to go over.
[36:54.98]I already tried to do that and it didn't work.
[36:57.82]The only thing I can think of is going around it.
[36:59.50]38 minutes of WALL-E.
[37:07.75]I guess I can just go around it.
[37:09.27]I don't know.
[37:12.11]Getting close to the heat.
[37:13.29]So why did it tell me I have to teleport?
[37:15.65]I just did it.
[37:16.13]Only a quarter of your fuel is left.
[37:20.55]You need to refill your tanks.
[37:24.94]Use sprint mode requires energy.
[37:27.44]Your batteries are below 75%.
[37:28.80]All right, where are those crystals?
[37:30.46]Sooner or later, you will need to recharge them.
[37:37.36]1,800 people watching me fight chat.
[37:44.13]I can't go over this because I'm going to get burned.
[37:49.53]I don't think I can make this.
[37:52.42]Oh, please.
[37:53.24]God, Wally!
[37:53.98]Yeah, give me that.
