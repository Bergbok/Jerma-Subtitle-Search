[00:03.04]timeless, legendary, strong.
[00:08.37]Those are some of the words you could use to describe Glue Man, one of our world's greatest superheroes.
[00:15.19]And for the first time ever, you can adorn yourself with this upper body garment.
[00:20.85]The Glue Man t-shirt is now available.
[00:23.83]Yes, that's right.
[00:24.92]Glue Man, protector of the innocent, defender of justice, and warden of all that is good and kind, has finally caved into marketing pressure to deliver this shirt to you.
[00:36.10]Buying this shirt will take you back to moments like these, Glue Man's Jerma Wrestling debut.
[00:42.20]As a 22-year-old newbie under the stage name G. Grossi, he made a real splash in his first match when he was nearly killed by Dogman, the magical dog magician, who at the time was considered at least partially blind.
[00:56.43]Each shirt does not come with a certificate of authenticity, but this might be what one may have looked like if they did.
[01:03.69]Signed and stamped by the father of all contemporary Jerma wrestling, George R. Glue Man Sr.
[01:09.80]himself.
[01:10.88]It is a true site of craftsmanship and quality.
[01:14.20]And again, no, you don't get one of these.
[01:17.46]How much does a t-shirt like this cost, you ask?
[01:20.81]not $12,000, not $8,000, not even $5,000.
[01:25.07]To get your very own Glue Man t-shirt, you need only one low payment of $20.
[01:33.36]Plus shipping and handling.
[01:35.08]Take pride in owning a piece of Germa Channel history
[01:38.32]Brag to all of your friends that you own a shirt whose depicted character has been deemed out loud as the worst character ever and useless by the individual who created him.
[01:49.42]These shirts are only available for a limited time and may never be available again.
