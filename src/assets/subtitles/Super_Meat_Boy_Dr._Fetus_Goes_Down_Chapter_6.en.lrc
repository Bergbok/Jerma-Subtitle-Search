[00:08.82]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.78]Jerma here with Super Meat Boy Mondays, Chapter 6, which is going to be the end.
[00:19.06]Now, this is... This may or may not be the final Meat Boy video I make.
[00:24.02]I know there's the Dark World stuff, there's Cotton Alley, there is the Warp Zones, Character Unlocks, Band-Aids.
[00:29.23]I know there's all that stuff in here, but I'm not sure if I'm going to do it or not.
[00:33.61]I might and I might not.
[00:34.79]I'm gonna leave that pretty much totally up to you guys.
[00:37.57]And I guess we'll just go from there.
[00:39.37]So if you want to see more Meat Boy, let me know in the comments and let me know with a like or a favorite or something like that so I can determine if you guys want to see more of this series.
[00:48.87]So we're just going to keep going here.
[00:51.43]Super Meat Boy Chapter 6, the end.
[00:54.29]Dancing around like a freak show.
[00:55.87]Hey, quit dancing, you piece of crap.
[00:58.86]No, I'm not going to stop dancing.
[01:00.24]And I have your girlfriend too.
[01:01.42]What are you going to do about it?
[01:04.02]The end.
[01:05.54]This is the end.
[01:09.17]Okay.
[01:10.27]There are only five levels in the end.
[01:12.74]So this hopefully does not take 60,000 years, but it probably will because this game is so goddamn hard.
[01:20.32]So let's just go here.
[01:22.74]Let's beat this in 10 minutes.
[01:24.10]What do you say?
[01:26.04]There's no way that's gonna happen.
[01:28.56]Easy here.
[01:30.08]Oh, it's locked.
[01:30.63]It's locked.
[01:31.03]Okay.
[01:31.69]Gotta go around, I believe.
[01:36.29]No, I don't.
[01:38.11]What was I supposed to do down here?
[01:39.89]Oh, there's the key.
[01:40.57]Okay.
[01:42.59]Oh.
[01:44.69]That's how you take down the wall over there.
[01:47.13]It's all coming back to me now.
[01:50.13]Jump over.
[01:51.27]Get the key over here.
[01:53.01]That opens up the wall over this side.
[01:56.87]This way.
[01:57.43]Okay, okay.
[01:59.59]Cheese, it's in gravy.
[02:00.65]All right there.
[02:01.41]Woohoo!
[02:03.18]So far, so good.
[02:05.93]Oh, I can't do anything careless here, though.
[02:14.97]I... Just go.
[02:19.75]I can do this.
[02:21.63]This level isn't even that bad.
[02:23.03]Come on, meat boy.
[02:24.47]Epic music.
[02:33.03]Epic music is gonna make me win.
[02:37.51]Back over this way.
[02:38.69]Head to here.
[02:40.59]Be careful of the saw blades.
[02:42.55]They will kill you.
[02:43.51]They have been known to do that.
[02:44.56]Alright, just don't do anything stupid here like you just did.
[02:49.42]No, I gotta stop jumping with it.
[02:53.28]And... Right now.
[02:56.32]Whoa!
[02:57.00]That was close.
[02:58.32]Alright, how many people died?
[03:01.31]How many did we lose?
[03:03.33]Only two or three.
[03:06.32]Here's the vector right here.
[03:09.48]Nice job.
[03:11.36]There you are.
[03:12.06]Woohoo!
[03:14.84]Schism.
[03:15.74]Schism.
[03:16.20]I don't even know how you say that word.
[03:19.24]I will protect your honor.
[03:21.54]I will defend you to the day I die.
[03:27.04]My lady.
[03:28.76]My beautiful, sweet lady.
[03:31.36]I will complete this for you.
[03:35.39]Oh, jeez!
[03:39.21]You just gotta drop straight down this.
[03:40.41]I don't know why I'm trying to do something tricky with that.
[03:43.23]Same thing here.
[03:43.93]There's no need to be so nuts about it.
[03:48.01]Now, if I remember correctly, it's easier to jump off of this, and I could be totally wrong, but I don't think I am.
[03:54.97]Judging by me completing that, I don't think I was wrong.
[03:59.00]Shoot me in the face with a machine gun!
[04:04.78]Just put, like, an entire... God.
[04:07.86]All right, just be easy.
[04:08.74]It's only the second level.
[04:09.52]Be easy here.
[04:12.52]Can't freak out.
[04:15.08]Nice and easy.
[04:15.98]There we are.
[04:18.18]Super Meat Boy, baby.
[04:22.34]There's the key.
[04:23.38]Now I gotta go back up.
[04:26.18]Oh my god!
[04:26.64]Oh my god!
[04:27.06]What am I doing?
[04:27.90]Why did I drop... Why did I drop down right there?
[04:33.02]What an idiot.
[04:34.86]Oh my god, I can't believe I did... Oh my god.
[04:43.23]Just go.
[04:44.09]Just jump, you piece of crap.
[04:48.29]I'm gonna drop a piano on your head if you do that again.
[04:51.39]Am I talking introspectively?
[04:53.49]Am I speaking to myself when I say that?
[04:55.07]Who am I talking to when I say that?
[04:57.03]Who's go- Okay, we're good.
[05:00.23]Like, who's gonna get the piano dropped on their head?
[05:02.51]Is it gonna be, like, me?
[05:05.21]You?
[05:05.73]No, I wouldn't do that to you.
[05:06.71]Why would I do that to you?
[05:08.17]That wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.
[05:10.05]No, don't go down there again.
[05:12.51]Just go down nice and slow, like this.
[05:18.10]There we are.
[05:18.66]That'll do it.
[05:20.36]Okay, jeez.
[05:20.96]Here we go.
[05:23.36]There we are.
[05:27.03]Okay, now just be careful here.
[05:29.45]You don't want to do anything ridiculous here.
[05:35.22]Can't screw this up.
[05:39.08]Just like that.
[05:40.40]I'll take the pie and I'll eat it too.
[05:46.13]How many died in the very beginning here?
[05:48.91]What, one dude?
[05:49.89]Alright, who got the piano dropped on them?
[05:53.95]That's what I want to know.
[05:57.24]You don't see that anymore.
[05:58.44]Nobody drops pianos on anybody anymore.
[06:01.60]See, back in the old days of cartoons, people used to get pianos dropped on their heads.
[06:06.70]Not anymore, though.
[06:11.58]Piano.
[06:13.21]Even the name is funny.
[06:16.11]Piano.
[06:16.65]No, it's still... It's so amusing.
[06:24.77]Oh, you get crushed by the thing, you elevator bastard!
[06:30.72]That was very unconventional, how I just got that.
[06:32.94]That's not how you're supposed to get that at all.
[06:34.42]But you know what?
[06:34.82]It works.
[06:35.16]If it works, then just take it.
[06:37.96]Get it and run!
[06:40.64]No, it's the exact same... I'm doing a carbon copy of the same thing I just did a second ago.
[06:45.11]Okay, easy.
[06:50.23]There's only a few levels here.
[06:52.19]You're gonna spend the majority of the damn time on the boss anyways, because the boss is really difficult.
[06:58.66]Okay, so they give it like a clock.
[07:01.99]And you're gonna get, uh, get that right there.
[07:04.41]Freeze.
[07:06.65]You're good.
[07:09.60]Just be smart.
[07:11.38]Don't do anything stupid.
[07:17.30]Let's keep it rolling.
[07:18.28]Just go.
[07:18.72]Speedrun.
[07:20.22]Speedrun.
[07:21.50]Oh, you thought you could mess with the speedrun.
[07:25.44]It's actually working.
[07:26.76]Speedrun's working.
[07:29.59]Wow.
[07:30.33]Uh, okay, I just went through half of that level right there in a speedrun.
[07:34.25]I did not expect to survive past that halfway point.
[07:39.36]Hey, what's up here that you want to be able to see?
[07:41.58]Because I forget.
[07:42.90]And I don't want to have to speedrun again.
[07:46.74]Oh, baby, that was a beauty, if I say so myself.
[07:51.77]This is it.
[07:53.21]After this, we are at the last boss of the game.
[07:55.77]Well, technically, of the storyline.
[07:58.29]Of the Meat Boy storyline.
[08:01.25]Now you... In God's... Jeez.
[08:08.45]Drop down, maybe.
[08:10.35]Oh, my God!
[08:11.63]That hurt.
[08:13.25]That hurt to do that.
[08:16.87]Yikes.
[08:19.12]Yikes.
[08:23.41]Wow!
[08:24.05]Wow!
[08:24.79]I am... Oh, this is difficult.
[08:26.45]I remember this.
[08:26.89]You gotta be very, very careful here.
[08:30.21]Oh!
[08:32.68]I did it too early!
[08:33.46]God!
[08:35.38]Ah, damn it!
[08:37.20]I would have did that in first try.
[08:38.92]Oh, now I'm mad and I'm getting all over the place.
[08:43.08]Oh, back at the beginning.
[08:44.13]Back at you.
[08:44.65]You know what?
[08:45.17]Just fall off.
[08:46.29]Let's start from scratch here again.
[08:47.57]And we're gonna speedrun.
[08:48.83]Because last time I speedrunned, it worked.
[08:51.91]Um, maybe not.
[08:53.65]Just, will you... Just get over there!
[08:56.23]You piece of crap!
[08:58.77]Speedrun.
[09:00.01]It's all about... just speeding.
[09:08.21]Forget the speedrun.
[09:09.13]Not gonna work.
[09:11.87]Up, up and away.
[09:16.28]No!
[09:17.20]What the hell?
[09:19.06]Will you stop doing that?
[09:20.76]Just get through the hole!
[09:24.62]I had it the first time, and I'm just a stupid idiot.
[09:27.86]And I got too busy scratching my ass at whatever the hell I was doing.
[09:32.60]I don't know how I would scratch my ass with, you know, my hands on the controller, but whatever.
[09:38.79]Now I forget how I just did this part.
[09:43.01]No, I don't.
[09:44.53]Just jump right through.
[09:46.81]Same thing here, just this time.
[09:48.59]Don't be... Don't be a butt-scratcher.
[09:54.87]Key.
[09:57.49]Oh.
[09:58.25]Oof.
[10:09.99]Damn.
[10:10.91]That was near the end of the level, too.
[10:14.67]Time to be quiet.
[10:15.96]We all know what happens when I be quiet.
[10:18.06]I complete levels that are difficult.
[10:25.27]There we go.
[10:30.07]There we are.
[10:30.97]Just don't do that again.
[10:43.93]Okay.
[10:45.66]Here is the last boss.
[10:48.00]Dr. Fetus.
[10:50.20]Here we go, guys.
[10:53.00]Where is he?
[10:53.38]I'm going to find him.
[10:54.26]Ow!
[10:55.52]Yeah, you're not going to come near me because I'll shoot you with a bazooka.
[10:58.17]You know what this is?
[10:58.77]It's a bazooka, you bastard.
[11:00.11]Yeah, you're dead now.
[11:01.05]Maybe you're not.
[11:02.11]Yeah, he's dead.
[11:03.11]Wait, what?
[11:04.89]Get out of here.
[11:06.01]Now he's dead.
[11:09.56]God, he's gonna kill me!
[11:10.76]This thing is jammed!
[11:11.78]This thing doesn't even work!
[11:12.80]Why'd I spend $5,000 on this thing?
[11:14.88]It's worthless!
[11:15.46]Come here!
[11:16.09]Let's go.
[11:17.31]The whole point of this is you gotta beat Dr. Fetus, you can't get killed by his missiles or his rockets, and you gotta kill him?
[11:20.87]Oh my god, I am so nervous.
[11:23.93]Doctor?
[11:24.97]Doctor?
[11:26.39]Doctor?
[11:27.71]Please?
[11:28.71]Doctor?
[11:30.27]Oh my god, I didn't realize what was happening.
[11:31.96]Okay.
[11:33.52]Didn't realize that was happening.
[11:36.26]Oh, great.

[12:13.02]Oh, come on.
[12:19.86]I'm almost there.
[12:23.32]Get up.
[12:24.32]Get up there.
[12:26.96]Oh, no.
[12:28.82]Oh.
[12:32.12]Damn it.
[12:32.65]I was at the end.
[12:33.55]I was near the end.
[12:34.37]I was...
[12:37.39]Mmm, oh fart in my face and call me Dave Stevenson.
[12:42.82]Oh my god.
[12:43.58]I'm so mad right now.
[12:45.48]I'm so I am so mad right now.
[12:49.06]Just take it easy.
[12:49.72]This is not even that difficult.
[12:50.88]I can do this with my eyes closed.
[12:53.18]That is an untrue statement.
[12:55.73]Let's pretend I didn't say that.
[12:57.29]Imagine playing this game with your eyes closed.
[13:01.19]It would not be possible.
[13:03.78]I wanna see a guy do a Let's Play of this game with their eyes closed, and have a facecam.
[13:08.95]Whoa.
[13:10.99]Careful here, he's gonna start shooting that stupid rocket launcher!
[13:20.51]This part was horrible, I can't believe I made it through this part!
[13:25.77]I had it!
[13:26.47]I had it the very first time I tried this, I had it!
[13:36.17]Man.
[13:39.37]Just go.
[13:39.83]You gotta stay in front of him.
[13:40.71]That's the major thing.
[13:41.69]If I can stay in front of him... I can do this.
[13:46.42]Believe in yourself.
[13:48.62]You gotta believe.
[13:51.02]That was why you... Alright.
[13:59.28]Time to do this.
[14:00.70]No more messing around.
[14:01.52]I'm doing this right now.
[14:05.89]Silent.
[14:14.19]It's all about just memorization.
[14:18.09]I'm playing that game where you flip the cards over and you memorize everything.
[14:24.04]Oh, somebody just texted me.
[14:26.08]Too bad.
[14:28.08]It's not as important as not dying in this level.
[14:31.72]It could be, though.
[14:32.32]That's the thing.
[14:37.75]Back where I was before.
[14:38.53]Okay, nice and easy here.
[14:48.33]Gotta hit that thing!
[14:57.48]Gotta hit that thing!
[14:58.18]Oh my god, I did it!
[15:02.01]No!
[15:05.73]Oh man, that looked like it hurt.
[15:07.67]I know.
[15:11.79]I'm sorry about everything.
[15:13.13]Oh my, that was pretty morbid.
[15:20.94]Let's get out of here, sweetheart.
[15:21.98]Let's go get a drink.
[15:23.22]Yeah, let's go get it.
[15:24.16]Wait, I'm not dead yet.
[15:26.50]F you.
[15:28.26]My final request is for you to die.
[15:31.10]Oh, now we gotta get out of here.
[15:33.47]We gotta run.
[15:34.83]Come on, let's go, sweetheart.
[15:41.99]I forgot that this was actually the last level.
[15:46.04]And it's really hard.
[16:03.91]So, ow, I just like hit my thumb.
[16:09.54]Man, this is very, very difficult.
[16:12.96]Time to be quiet again.
[16:16.28]Oh, shoot me in the face.
[16:18.82]I've already said that, but still.
[16:21.94]Let's go, honey.
[16:23.58]You know, oh man, maybe somebody's probably texting me right now, like, Hey, Jeremy, your house is on fire.
[16:29.23]I'm standing outside looking at it.
[16:30.69]And I'm just like, I can't talk right now.
[16:34.05]Uh, Jeremy, there's a tornado about to come, like, to your house.
[16:37.71]How did I not die at that?
[16:41.46]Okay, let's go here.
[16:42.52]Whew.
[16:52.26]Jumped too hard!
[16:57.30]Oh, now somebody's calling me.
[16:58.88]My duck call.
[17:01.32]Hold on, I gotta answer this.
[17:02.33]This is like my mother.
[17:04.85]Okay, so the house is not on fire.
[17:07.25]But I've... My mother was just like, needed to talk to me.
[17:11.71]It's okay.
[17:12.47]Let's get back into this.
[17:14.33]Go, go, go.
[17:16.35]Nope.
[17:18.13]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[17:26.00]God, I'm going to puke.
[17:31.78]Up, up and away.
[17:33.96]If I can just get by this one stupid pot.
[17:38.00]Like that.
[17:38.54]Okay, now be easy here.
[17:42.75]Let me look at this I just said I wanted to look at it and I didn't even look at it I just went I didn't even think I just went just go Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes Be careful you don't want to freak out here.
[18:04.19]Oh
[18:06.04]Gotta drop right... now.
[18:11.70]Wow.
[18:14.10]It's so long!
[18:16.32]It's so ridiculous, I'm going to throw up.
[18:19.92]Once it goes around one more time.
[18:34.63]I thought I beat the game, I forgot about this part!
[18:39.02]This very long, very awful part of the game.
[18:42.12]Okay, I got through that, I'm good with that.
[18:47.92]This part's not that bad, I just gotta go now.
[18:50.04]Jump over it twice.
[18:52.18]Wait till it goes, go!
[18:54.00]Go up here.
[18:54.63]In this part you just kinda slug your way over this way.
[18:59.62]Get up here.
[19:01.58]Risky, I know, but I had to do that.
[19:03.52]Alright, no more thinking.
[19:05.44]Just go.
[19:12.85]Never made that noise before.
[19:26.00]Son of a bitch.
[19:27.44]This is so hard.
[19:29.74]Dark World?
[19:30.67]Can you imagine this on the Dark World?
[19:33.53]Blood's gonna come out of my eyes if I play this on the Dark World.
[19:39.47]I should just... What am I thinking here?
[19:42.22]There's a... I can just skip this.
[19:45.84]Wow.
[19:46.52]Okay.
[19:47.08]That's good to know.
[19:49.08]I'll remember that for next time.
[19:55.41]Easy up there.
[19:57.48]These are just saw blades.
[19:58.54]These are just saw blades.
[20:00.06]You can do this.
[20:02.63]Just saw blades.
[20:05.15]Just go easy through the saw blades.
[20:07.49]That's all you gotta do.
[20:10.43]And don't just skip those.
[20:16.15]I did it!
[20:17.98]At the end!
[20:19.34]We did it, sweetheart!
[20:20.66]I'm so happy!
[20:22.95]Come on, hurry up.
[20:23.61]What are you doing?
[20:25.03]Oh no, this thing's falling everywhere.
[20:26.31]I can't get out of here.
[20:28.23]Oh no.
[20:29.33]Oh.
[20:31.27]He's dead.
[20:33.39]No!
[20:34.33]I got you, man.
[20:35.71]Just get out of here.
[20:37.10]Go with your girlfriend.
[20:38.82]Wow, thanks.
[20:39.38]You're the best.
[20:41.14]I... No, just forget about me, man.
[20:43.02]I got this.
[20:44.16]Oh, but... No, man.
[20:46.52]Just go with her.
[20:48.42]I love you both.
[20:52.93]That's him dying.
[20:55.19]Well, Meat Boy and his girlfriend decided to go to Paradise Island after this to see their honeymoon.
[21:03.95]The Dr. Fetus was killed during the collapse of his lair.
[21:08.75]And Pooh Boy saved the day as well.
[21:11.51]So I guess we can say one... I'm back to kill you!
[21:14.57]You stupid bitch!
[21:15.48]I'll kill you!
[21:15.94]I'll rip your eyeballs off!
[21:17.77]Super Meat Boy!
[21:19.39]The end.
[21:21.73]Oh, goodness gracious.
[21:24.59]Oh my god.
[21:26.47]Okay.
[21:27.51]Well, thank you guys so much for watching the series.
[21:30.59]I very, very much appreciate it.
[21:32.27]And like I said in the beginning, if you want to see this continue, if you want to see some of the Warp Zones, more of the characters unlock, some Dark Zone stuff, or Dark World stuff, then just leave me a comment, let me know, or leave me a like on this video, and we will go from there.
[21:45.47]So, I guess we'll just let this play out.
[21:47.94]Thank you guys so much for watching.
[21:49.58]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[21:51.31]And of course, take care, everybody.
