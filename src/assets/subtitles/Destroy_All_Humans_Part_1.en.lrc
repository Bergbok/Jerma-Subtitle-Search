[00:04.77]Hello.
[00:08.15]How are you?
[00:10.75]Welcome, Friday night.
[00:13.17]Or maybe Friday morning for some of you guys.
[00:17.00]Is it Friday morning anywhere in the world right now?
[00:20.28]Could it be?
[00:22.04]It's like 6.50, 7 o'clock here.
[00:25.56]Could it be Friday?
[00:26.84]What time is it in China right now?
[00:31.06]What about Hawaii?
[00:31.70]What time is it in Hawaii?
[00:41.97]Friday afternoon.
[00:42.59]Alright, well, if you're watching from Hawaii, good morning.
[00:50.35]Um... This is bad.
[00:52.41]Hey, well, at least, at least we got, like, three weeks, or just under a month.
[01:03.77]The internet's all fucked up again.
[01:09.75]Well, hey, at least we got like fucking seven streams.
[01:18.15]Yeah, apparently that's happening right now.
[01:20.41]I did not expect this.
[01:21.31]It just is happening right now.
[01:23.99]That's great.
[01:31.46]I am not going to be at E3.
[01:34.00]Behold, I have... Oh my god.
[01:37.94]By the way, if you're curious, I am going to be out of here permanently in the next probably 45 days.
[01:45.96]I'm actually going to Nevada very, very soon here in the next few weeks to go find a place to move to.
[01:54.82]I'm trying to steamroll this as fast as I can.
[02:02.18]So.
[02:04.00]Would Gio guess a ring somewhere?
[02:09.35]I'm going to sit here for a few minutes.
[02:11.28]I'm not going to tweet anything yet.
[02:16.70]Because this might be just a random fluke.
[02:29.58]45 days equals 2 years.
[02:30.74]No, I have to get the fuck out of here.
[02:34.05]And I have to get out of here as soon as possible.
[02:37.68]For, like, probably three or four different reasons.
[02:41.18]But... It just... It just never ends, apparently.
[02:48.99]There's literally nothing I can do about this.
[02:51.01]This problem has been fixed... Like, twelve fucking times.
[02:57.29]And... I guess it doesn't even matter.
[02:59.67]Oh, yeah, we fixed it!
[03:02.45]It'll be fixed for, like, a couple months, and then it just goes back to being dogshit.
[03:12.11]Why Nevada?
[03:13.69]I'll give you, like, three reasons for why Nevada.
[03:16.41]It's, like, an hour away from LA.
[03:20.00]There's no state taxes in Nevada.
[03:23.04]So, like, that's fucking pretty huge.
[03:24.76]Especially because state taxes in Massachusetts are huge.
[03:28.40]I mean, that's just cool.
[03:32.48]It's a 24-hour city.
[03:33.74]That means that through 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning, I usually have sleep problems, so I can go get, like, a steak at 3 a.m.
[03:44.87]It's an hour away.
[03:45.49]Yeah, you get on a plane.
[03:47.01]Vegas to LA is like an hour and ten minutes.
[03:48.89]Not even.
[03:56.86]Wait, but did I say LA is an hour away from LA?
[04:03.30]Yeah, you get... Vegas to LA is like not even an hour and a half.
[04:07.50]It's like an hour and ten minutes.
[04:12.60]Reinforce my bad habits?
[04:13.92]Do it!
[04:16.76]Uh, but yeah, this is unexpected.
[04:24.06]Unexpected.
[04:28.25]In a way, LA is an hour away from LA.
[04:30.47]That's true.
[04:33.83]Move to the Bay Area?
[04:35.79]Uh... I don't have, like, $7,000 a month that it takes to live in the Bay Area.
[04:44.02]That's like... Aren't people, like, uh...
[04:47.88]I read something the other day.
[04:50.27]Aren't people living in college dormitories because humans can't even physically, financially live in San Francisco?
[05:00.07]I read that somewhere.
[05:08.62]Time to sell out.
[05:12.90]We might have an opportunity here.
[05:19.74]None of that backyard barbecue bullshit, you know what I'm saying?
[05:25.67]Is that for real?
[05:26.21]Oh, yeah.
[05:27.31]Cost of living in San Francisco is so insanely high that there are companies that are making dormitories, like college dorms, shared living for people that live in San Francisco.
[05:43.81]But there's another reason.
[05:45.19]Why Nevada?
[05:45.73]Sorry, why Nevada?
[05:46.63]You know what I'm saying?
[05:50.46]The cost of living in Nevada is like nothing compared to what it is here.
[05:57.26]Or even California for that matter.
[06:02.48]My audio is a bit low.
[06:04.53]How about now?
[06:09.59]That's just an apartment?
[06:10.45]No, we're talking like shared bathrooms.
[06:13.11]You ever live in a dorm before?
[06:14.97]It's a hallway of single rooms and then everybody has a shared public bathroom.
[06:20.47]It's more like an office than it is living space.
[06:30.39]I should go live in Reno rather than Las Vegas.
[06:32.41]I mean, the plan is to go look.
[06:34.19]So, I'm going out there.
[06:36.46]That was essentially, instead of going to E3, I know I put aside a little bit of money.
[06:41.58]Instead of going to E3, I'm going to look for places in good old Nevada.
[06:51.62]So, I would be at E3 right now.
[06:53.65]Fuck.
[06:54.07]What the fuck?
[06:54.55]I'm not fucking... Bullshit.
[06:56.01]I can't believe I'm moving.
[07:00.01]So, I'm going to be all over that state.
[07:01.45]Alright, I'm... I think we might be through the worst of this.
[07:10.07]It still doesn't look good.
[07:18.48]What's the cost of living in Las Vegas?
[07:20.24]It's very low.
[07:23.41]The greater Vegas area is very cheap and very affordable.
[07:29.13]Now, obviously, if you live in, like, downtown Las Vegas, you know, you open up your door and people are, like, throwing dice and shit.
[07:35.54]Yeah, I mean, it's probably going to be way more expensive.
[07:37.58]It depends on where I want to go.
[07:40.08]Maybe I do want to go there.
[07:41.28]Probably not, but who knows.
[07:49.73]the nightbot sub expired wait what a nightbot was subbed to the channel instead of mortgage debts you have gambling debts that's if you get I don't I don't gambling's cool but it's not like I'm gonna go there and wait you guys act like I'm gonna get off the plane
[08:12.82]And, all right, I'm off the plane.
[08:14.56]Oh, what is it?
[08:15.20]It's nice and warm out today.
[08:17.27]Mmm.
[08:18.33]Ah, fresh air.
[08:19.69]Taxi!
[08:20.37]Taxi!
[08:20.89]Please!
[08:21.81]Like, screeches.
[08:23.71]Here, here, here, here.
[08:24.53]I don't care how much it costs.
[08:25.45]Here's $200.
[08:27.33]Get me to the nearest casino right now.
[08:28.73]Quick!
[08:29.73]Go as fast as you can.
[08:31.10]And he, like, steps on it.
[08:32.04]And, like, I roll out of the car when he pulls.
[08:34.22]Like, we get to Caesar's Palace.
[08:35.48]And I fucking roll out of the car.
[08:37.28]And like SMASH!
[08:38.24]OH FUCK!
[08:38.74]I break my arm and like fuckin' smash my teeth in the ground.
[08:41.46]Oh, wait, wait, wait!
[08:42.32]Oh, thank you!
[08:43.24]I just stumble into the casino.
[08:44.88]Hi, everybody!
[08:45.40]Hey!
[08:46.04]Take out my credit card.
[08:47.16]Fuckin' just dump out $10,000 as fast as I can.
[08:49.64]I don't even care.
[08:50.18]I don't care if anybody sees my password from behind me.
[08:52.56]Pull the $10,000 out.
[08:54.82]Fuckin' stumble over to the roulette table.
[08:57.72]Put 10 grand on 20, please, red!
[09:01.76]Ah, shit!
[09:02.40]I lost everything!
[09:03.52]You think I'm gonna- What?
[09:05.72]Time to go home!
[09:10.61]No, gambling... And plus, I think, I don't know, maybe some of you guys don't understand this.
[09:18.26]Las Vegas... I'm going to change the scene here.
[09:21.02]So you can just see at least the thing we were going to do.
[09:23.18]And hopefully still do.
[09:25.28]Las Vegas is like the tourist area, right?
[09:30.36]There are tons of places in Nevada.
[09:34.67]I'm going to say that incorrectly forever.
[09:37.15]But...
[09:39.12]There are tons of places to go gamble that aren't like fucking Caesar's palace.
[09:43.57]You can go anywhere you want.
[09:50.51]So that's why he raised the bit minimum.
[09:54.53]But yeah, distort all humans is what we're going to do.
[10:01.55]How many frames are we dropping now?
[10:04.13]Can you guys tell?
[10:04.73]Because it says dropping about 5%.
[10:10.38]So I don't know if I should wait or should start or they've slot machines in CVS.
[10:16.34]Yeah.
[10:16.58]It's if you want to do it, but here's the thing, right?
[10:19.61]I, you can, there are slot, not slot machines.
[10:22.63]I can go to a convenience store here and buy like 10 lottery tickets.
[10:27.15]I can buy a bunch of scratch tickets.
[10:28.31]I don't do that now.
[10:30.52]So the only difference is, you know, what's the CVS is right there.
[10:33.32]There's a slot machine here.
[10:35.18]I don't buy scratch tickets anyways here.
[10:37.48]And they're in every single store.
[10:41.28]Seems okay.
[10:42.76]Okay.
[10:44.34]Well, you know, we're going to have to deal with it.
[10:45.84]I'm sorry that we're having this problem again.
[10:48.56]But I tweeted it.
[10:49.70]That means it's official.
[10:50.50]We're just going to stream and see what happens.
[10:51.72]Let me turn on the audio.
[10:53.38]It's kind of loud, but it's alright.
[10:59.91]Scratch tickets don't have a bonus round.
[11:02.79]Well, yeah, they do.
[11:03.45]You can get on Scratch all... If you get every single thing, you get the bonus.
[11:08.91]Sometimes you scratch one off and you get the whole card.
[11:11.71]That's a bonus.
[11:14.80]Alright, let's get going.
[11:16.32]I know I'm trying to burn as much time as possible.
[11:20.14]I've been sitting here for like 10 minutes now.
[11:22.08]Hopefully it is not awful.
[11:23.92]Destroy all humans.
[11:25.76]Old PlayStation 2 game.
[11:28.64]Something I did not realize, I did not know, this is actually available for kind of a steep price.
[11:34.75]It's $20, but it's the 1080p version.
[11:39.47]You can get it on PS4.
[11:41.95]Destroy All Humans 1, Destroy All Humans 2 are both on here.
[11:45.36]PSN.
[11:46.72]$20 each.
[11:47.50]But you get the higher graphical fidelity, so I guess it's potentially worth it if you want to play it.
[11:53.52]But here we go.
[11:58.12]Destroy all humans 20 bucks is steep.
[12:03.56]Well 20 bucks is fairly steep for a you know 15 year old game You get it for free online, but I won't so That's 40 bucks for one and two which I Mean I could I think you can get this like for PlayStation 2 at a used game store for like eight bucks.
[12:26.54]Oh
[12:29.50]Frugal streamer.
[12:30.62]You guys think I'm gonna go to Vegas and blow all my money?
[12:34.15]I think $20 for Destroy All Humans 1 is a little steep.
[12:37.48]You're gonna put $20 in a slot machine tomorrow?
[12:40.08]Hello, friends.
[12:41.82]Have you ever gazed up into the night sky and wondered at the possibility of life on other planets?
[12:47.87]What marvelous beings might exist out there, hands extended in friendship, awaiting the moment when we humans take our first tentative steps into space?
[12:59.45]What tales will be told of that glorious day when we are first contacted by our brothers from beyond the stars?
[13:11.64]I've never played this game.
[13:12.90]I'm excited.
[13:15.58]I have no time in any of these games.
[13:19.59]All systems go, General.
[13:21.83]Four.
[13:23.57]Come on, baby.
[13:24.81]Show us what you got.
[13:25.89]Three.
[13:26.77]What the hell?
[13:27.19]That's me.
[13:27.61]That's me.
[13:29.99]Two.
[13:31.02]What in the blue blazes is that?
[13:32.38]This looks pretty good for PlayStation 2.
[13:34.94]No.
[13:35.48]Wait.
[13:36.14]Stop the countdown.
[13:42.91]All of a sudden it zooms into my pilot view and I just go, did I do that?
[13:47.62]And the Family Matters song plays.
[13:51.68]Steve Urkel is like an alien in this one.
[13:53.94]They rebooted it.
[13:56.12]Whoa.
[14:14.28]Hey, guess where this takes place?
[14:17.01]Out in Area 51, Nevada!
[14:18.25]Oh, that's Richard Horvitz.
[14:29.03]Invader Zoom.
[14:29.53]Billy and I, Mandy.
[14:42.48]Let's just say I hope you turn out to be less of an evolutionary dead end than your predecessor.
[14:49.62]You lost me.
[14:51.82]Shall I tell you a secret?
[14:54.42]Few of our people know this, but the DNA patterns in our cloning banks are becoming more and more degraded with each new clone.
[15:03.22]That's bad, right?
[15:05.15]Only if we want to retain our immortality through cloning.
[15:08.48]Of course it's bad!
[15:10.78]I sent Crypto-136 in search of a planet we visited many eons ago.
[15:15.67]A planet seeded with pure Furon DNA.
[15:20.13]But I lost contact.
[15:22.36]Let me get this straight.
[15:23.92]You sent me, him, Crypto136, to a hostile planet, and he's disappeared.
[15:30.96]Maybe captured.
[15:32.28]Maybe even being tortured as we speak.
[15:35.08]Well, I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.
[15:36.83]I bet you wouldn't.
[15:38.33]Let me tell you something, Pox.
[15:40.79]You're a smart cookie.
[15:42.53]But there's a time for thought, and there's a time for action.
[15:47.21]And this is one of those times.
[15:50.53]Which?
[15:51.09]The second one.
[15:54.35]Perhaps you're right, 137.
[15:55.21]Why is this guy's face shamed like a Nintendo 64 controller?
[15:59.13]A Crypto's meridium captured by a bunch of monkeys?
[16:02.25]We gotta go in.
[16:03.51]We gotta crack some graniums.
[16:05.89]We gotta rescue me.
[16:07.19]Him.
[16:07.71]He's gotta rescue me.
[16:08.91]I mean, we gotta... I gotta... Grains, man.
[16:11.87]When do I get to blow things up?
[16:13.99]Patience, Crypto.
[16:15.13]Patience.
[16:16.31]I take your point.
[16:19.05]I'm going to lean in it.
[16:20.19]I want to play Star Fox.
[16:22.61]That's what I'm talking about.
[16:25.73]So, what's the name of this crummy planet?
[16:30.21]Our destination.
[16:32.93]The planet Earth.
[16:35.27]After 10,000 years, I'm free.
[16:37.21]It's time to conquer Earth.
[16:42.06]How did that person talk like that?
[16:45.32]Gruntilda, what was her name?
[16:48.20]What was her name?
[16:50.17]Gruntilda Repulsa from, uh, I was going to say Star Wars, Power Rangers.
[16:54.29]Alright, archives.
[17:01.03]Alright, so I get... Bee Movie Theater.
[17:07.59]For an origami, some assembly required.
[17:11.49]What is Bee Movie Theater?
[17:12.54]Oh, the THQ logo.
[17:13.82]Oh, no, that's too bad.
[17:14.94]I didn't see that.
[17:19.30]Just take a look around.
[17:20.48]What else we got?
[17:22.66]Audio display.
[17:24.85]Turn subtitles on.
[17:25.89]Widescreen's already on, so that's good.
[17:27.97]This is the 1080p version, man.
[17:29.13]Come on.
[17:30.83]Volume is fine.
[17:32.75]Let's put that over to mono real quick.
[17:36.17]Controls, normal, no vibration.
[17:38.21]Get out of here.
[17:40.05]Save game is right here.
[17:42.77]It's fine.
[17:46.74]Experience everything.
[17:50.10]All right, Pox's lab.
[17:52.06]Just take a look around real quick.
[17:53.24]Just take a look around.
[17:54.80]Welcome to my little laboratory.
[17:57.12]You may not have known this, but I flatter myself to be something of an inventor.
[18:01.53]In my spare time, I've been developing some truly impressive weapon and ability upgrades.
[18:06.25]I'd be happy to share them with you.
[18:08.64]If you've got something for me in trade, say some of that delicious DNA you've collected.
[18:16.55]I'm getting a lot of Richard Horvitz is doing Mark Hamill's Joker.
[18:21.35]That's all I was hearing.
[18:24.47]I was just hearing the Joker, but not Mark Hamill.
[18:26.95]Alright, upgrade Crypto, upgrade Saucer.
[18:28.64]I probably can't do any of this.
[18:31.26]They need DNA.
[18:33.24]So you suck people's DNA and you can research new weapons.
[18:35.92]That's cool.
[18:38.46]Alright, let's just go to a mission.
[18:40.81]Let's go to the hangar.
[18:43.04]Alright, uh, Turnispid Farm, destination Earth.
[18:46.68]Invade.
[18:58.50]I'm ready.
[19:01.11]It's a weekly Joker reference.
[19:05.13]Come on, he's my favorite cartoon character.
[19:09.99]Blue Moon, Drive-In Cinema.
[19:14.59]I can't wait to pick up cows with my funny radar.
[19:18.49]No, I actually am gonna do that.
[19:21.63]This is probably a little loud.
[19:37.21]Do you have a Bane reference?
[19:40.66]No.
[19:41.80]You want me to get fired?
[19:43.04]Orthopox to Cryptosporidium-137.
[19:45.39]Come in, Cryptosporidium.
[19:47.77]Crypto here.
[19:49.37]How's the view from the safety of the mothership?
[19:53.71]Very funny.
[19:55.23]Let's just say I'm glad I'm up here and you're down there.
[19:59.85]Loathsome little planet.
[20:01.67]Now, Crypto, to ensure this invasion runs smoothly, it is imperative we identify the dominant life forms on this world.
[20:11.45]Those lactating bovoids are likely candidates.
[20:15.45]He thinks it's the cows.
[20:18.25]Smelling gas bags beyond the fence.
[20:21.20]Yes, I'm afraid I do.
[20:23.16]But they're covered in nipples.
[20:25.72]Now, Cryptosporidium!
[20:29.42]You may look and aim by physically manipulating the right analog stick.
[20:34.45]You can move about the area using the left analog stick.
[20:38.32]I knew he was going to do this.
[20:40.56]I knew he was going to tell me how to use the controller.
[20:44.38]Target a cow and press and hold the L1 button.
[20:46.88]The scan ability has appeared on the X button.
[20:51.80]Read the cow's mind by pressing the X button.
[20:53.90]Remember to continue to press and hold the L1 button.
[20:56.21]So you can scan their brain.
[20:59.39]We can peer into the minds of lower life forms via the cortex scan.
[21:04.03]Rip the preliterate thoughts from their pathetic little brains.
[21:09.11]What do we got?
[21:09.53]Alright, moo is that one.
[21:12.93]Primitive, yet profound.
[21:15.31]Scan another one.
[21:17.97]Of course they're a cow, that's what they're going to think.
[21:21.82]I was going to say, why are they not thinking in English?
[21:25.92]I think I'm going to be violently ill.
[21:30.44]Attention Earth creature.
[21:32.64]This planet is now part of the Furon Empire.
[21:36.21]Your benevolent masters welcome you.
[21:41.94]dog bites him in the face we wish to abduct you for the purpose of scientific research the procedure will be protracted and invasive do you have any objections I mean that's technically no earth creature I am addressing you respond or be vaporized I don't care how many stomachs you have I don't have time for this
[22:11.62]Oh, God.
[22:13.48]Target a cow and press and hold the L1 button.
[22:15.66]The PK ability has appeared on the triangle button.
[22:18.66]Tap triangle to lift the cow into the air and use the right analog to move it around.
[22:22.54]We Furons have evolved the astounding power of psychokinesis.
[22:27.22]All right.
[22:27.72]Target an object or creature, then hold the L1 button.
[22:32.33]Keep holding, then tap the triangle button to lift the target into the sky.
[22:38.27]All right.
[22:41.03]God all right push in out.
[22:43.56]What am I supposed to do?
[22:45.44]In?
[22:48.26]I killed that one.
[22:49.14]Oops, sorry.
[22:50.90]Hold on.
[22:53.47]Let's pull him in.
[22:54.01]All right pull.
[22:59.31]Hold L1 button then hurl the bovine by double tapping triangle button.
[23:07.76]That's so stupid.
[23:09.16]Alright, let's do it again.
[23:11.32]Bye.
[23:11.68]Oh, I'm drowning them.
[23:14.60]That's so mean.
[23:16.09]That's not alright.
[23:18.21]Using the mental abilities drains concentration.
[23:21.01]The concentration meter is at the top left of the screen.
[23:24.23]Recharges over time when not using your mental abilities.
[23:27.35]So I have to just get... What if I scan this one and this one's actually intelligent?
[23:32.97]No, you're not.
[23:35.05]Use PK to finish off the belligerent bovines.
[23:38.47]Slam them into the ground.
[23:39.87]I want to, like, break a window with my cow baseball.
[23:44.65]I didn't make it.
[23:45.25]Wait, slam them into the ground?
[23:49.38]Okay, you can just go like this?
[23:52.74]No, I can, like, you break their necks.
[23:55.44]Sick, okay.
[23:58.90]Here come the people.
[23:59.46]I feel like this is going to be a lot of fun.
[24:01.44]All right.
[24:01.70]Press and hold the R1 button to fire a Zap-O-Matic.
[24:17.73]To raise the batteries, wait for them to recharge before firing again.
[24:20.43]Aim the Zap-O-Matic by using the right analog stick.
[24:22.23]What am I doing?
[24:23.65]Did I kill him?
[24:24.37]Alright, it has range.
[24:26.71]Got it.
[24:27.31]Alright.
[24:27.93]Oh no, I was supposed to not kill anybody.
[24:47.21]Target the farmer's corpse and press and hold the L1 button.
[24:49.55]An extract ability has appeared.
[24:50.90]You extract their brains.
[24:58.84]Alright.
[24:59.60]Holy shit.
[25:01.88]Oh my god.
[25:02.54]That was... This is way more awful than I thought it was gonna be.
[25:08.28]Harold!
[25:09.08]Come on back!
[25:09.88]You gotta see this!
[25:11.19]They got a talking horse on the TV!
[25:13.37]I ain't never seen nothing like...
[25:18.25]No, I'm thinking I'm gonna push her head into the ceiling.
[25:26.87]Oh no, break into the house and I'm gonna smash her head into the TV.
[25:31.43]Crypto is protected from damage by a shield.
[25:33.97]The shield's energy bar is shown at the top right.
[25:36.17]Evading combat for a short period of time will give the Halo shield time to recharge, because that's where everybody got it from.
[25:41.78]If the shield is depleted, Crypto becomes vulnerable to death.
[25:45.70]Alright.
[25:48.40]Are those people just walking around?
[25:51.86]What about the chickens?
[25:52.52]Can I scan the chicken's brain?
[25:56.00]Oh, fuck.
[25:58.69]Whoops.
[25:58.99]I'm sorry.
[26:01.89]Can I throw a chicken at somebody?
[26:04.27]Hold on.
[26:04.63]Let me try.
[26:06.49]Oh, shit.
[26:10.19]Oh, you can pick people up.
[26:11.55]Oh, my God.
[26:12.17]All right.
[26:12.83]Oh, shit.
[26:13.43]Come here.
[26:22.70]Why did you do that?
[26:24.13]I didn't even... Alright, get them brains out!
[26:26.83]Those three are the same guy.
[26:38.23]Evening, Ms.
[26:38.99]Turnip Seed.
[26:40.43]We got a call from Farmer Dixon over the other side of the state road.
[26:44.35]He killed his own friend.
[26:45.15]Said he heard some pretty strange noises coming from over this way.
[26:49.02]What is that?
[26:50.44]A new silo?
[26:51.72]Crypto!
[26:53.12]That human law enforcement officer is attempting an unauthorized entry of your spacecraft.
[26:58.88]So this is the stars.
[26:59.78]Here's the GTA stars.
[27:00.96]If those big brains were to get their hands on your quantum deconstructor, they could rip a hole in the space-time continuum.
[27:09.63]Vaporize the inquisitive authority.
[27:12.07]So I can fly.
[27:14.99]Vapor, vapor, vapor, vapor.
[27:21.89]Lady, why would you walk into that?
[27:23.56]Come here.
[27:35.42]Of course hay wouldn't kill somebody.
[27:38.28]Give me their brains.
[27:43.00]I just hit him with a pillow.
[27:43.90]That's all I did.
[27:46.76]I want to get the DNA.
[27:50.32]This is the upgrade stuff, right?
[27:54.60]Whoa, shit.
[27:55.08]Okay, no, never mind.
[27:58.24]I ran out of battery.
[28:00.16]Hold on, here we go.
[28:05.87]That's so awful.
[28:07.73]Can you suck out the brains of a chicken?
[28:12.65]No, you can't.
[28:14.41]Alright, back to the saucer.
[28:18.31]Holy shit, you can pick up the cars?
[28:19.79]I think it's too heavy for my brain.
[28:25.82]Maybe I can get it later.
[28:31.74]Take the chicken's brain.
[28:32.99]I could.
[28:40.19]You can't later.
[28:41.79]Use your left analog stick to propel the saucer forwards and backwards.
[28:46.73]I get to fly the saucer?
[28:48.39]To turn the saucer, use the right analog stick.
[28:51.25]I'm gonna crash.
[28:53.99]Press and hold the R1 button to fire the death ray.
[28:57.59]It's going to overheat if you do it for too long.
[29:00.03]Quickly cool down when not in use.
[29:01.41]Alright.
[29:03.01]Oh, Christ.
[29:05.79]Okay.
[29:06.27]Am I sucking up the house?
[29:09.29]I'm destroying the house.
[29:12.55]The game is called Destroy Everything.
[29:17.80]Get rid of all this stuff.
[29:18.84]It's pretty much the name of the game.
[29:21.88]Destroy the farm.
[29:22.54]Got it.
[29:30.03]That's that.
[29:30.63]Alright.
[29:32.09]Big farm.
[29:38.14]And asylum.
[29:41.92]That's cool.
[29:42.42]That overheat happens pretty quickly.
[29:47.76]Now I get six stars.
[29:48.68]Here comes the villain freak.
[29:50.88]They got here quick.
[29:52.20]Eight guys.
[29:53.02]Here comes the entire United States military.
[29:54.65]You don't really have much of a chance here.
[29:56.33]They're all gone.
[29:56.87]All of them.
[30:26.84]Oh, whoa.
[30:29.08]We're gone.
[30:29.68]When the saucer takes damage, the hull integrity is reduced.
[30:32.98]It's shown at the top right.
[30:33.78]It's health.
[30:34.91]The only way to repair the hull is to find a repair pod.
[30:38.07]Pox drops them in when you destroy certain buildings.
[30:42.53]You got zero.
[30:43.21]The saucer is destroyed in Cryptos.
[30:44.33]Look out!
[30:45.53]There are more to the north in the bushes.
[30:48.56]The bushes tank.
[30:52.04]Oh, ran out of cooldown juice.
[30:56.43]I feel like this game would be a lot of fun as a multiplayer.
[31:02.70]Did they ever do that?
[31:03.42]Now I get hit.
[31:10.98]Go, go, go, go, go.
[31:12.43]Faster, faster, faster.
[31:13.79]Whoa.
[31:15.41]Whoa!
[31:21.83]Tutorial done.
[31:23.71]Second one does.
[31:25.72]Second one's co-op.
[31:26.74]Oh my god.
[31:27.56]That's probably so much fun.
[31:31.51]So why did they make any more of these?
[31:33.57]Is there a reason?
[31:34.27]The path the Furon was terrible, right?
[31:35.89]That's why the studio got liquidated.
[31:37.71]Did you see what I saw?
[31:38.73]You bet your sweet ass I did.
[31:42.28]What did you see?
[31:43.18]Little green man in a flying saucer wiping out the best infantry unit in the U.S.
[31:47.64]Army.
[31:48.68]Right.
[31:49.08]Good.
[31:49.52]Me too.
[31:50.48]Green?
[31:51.30]Not gray?
[31:52.67]Don't be a stiff.
[31:53.99]You know what it means?
[31:55.47]Absolutely.
[31:56.91]What?
[31:58.09]It means the papers got it right for once.
[32:00.39]Get on the horn to silhouette.
[32:01.99]We've got the worst case scenario.
[32:04.17]This guy got like split personality.
[32:06.25]I don't believe it.
[32:07.89]Believe it.
[32:08.79]Roswell was only the beginning.
[32:11.07]The invasion is on.
[32:14.97]Mission complete.
[32:17.62]Cattle mutilation pandemic.
[32:18.96]Farmer disappears amidst cow abuse allegations.
[32:22.71]Who's the next Miss Rockwell?
[32:29.71]Alright, harvesting.
[32:30.43]You will need to land the saucer to harvest DNA.
[32:33.87]Once on the ground, you can gather more DNA by extracting brain stems, completing side missions, and collecting furon probes.
[32:41.11]You'll be notified when you have collected enough DNA to unlock the next mission.
[32:45.28]Collect 195 DNA to unlock the next mission.
[32:48.90]Wait, what?
[32:52.31]Oh man, so wait, now I just have to go do stuff?
[32:55.09]Alright, that's cool.
[32:56.41]Let's do it.
[32:59.41]Let's extract some DNA.
[33:07.03]I saw something on the ground right here.
[33:10.50]Of course there are anal probes.
[33:11.68]Press the R2 button to cycle to the anal probe.
[33:15.42]Does it do it on screen?
[33:18.21]Fire the anal probe, giving the target a mild probe.
[33:21.11]This causes them to grab their butt and run for the hills.
[33:24.69]Press and hold the R1 button to charge up the anal probe.
[33:27.47]The pure shock of this super probe will cause the target's head to explode.
[33:32.47]This yields a juicy, DNA-rich, fresh brain stem.
[33:38.90]All right.
[33:40.04]So R2 is anal probe, and then R1.
[33:43.28]Holding R1, charge it up.
[33:46.88]So, Zap-O-Matic or Anal Probe?
[33:52.24]Uh... Is this...?
[34:01.88]Oh, my God.
[34:03.16]Okay, well... Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[34:07.78]His anus is a little bit... His anus is a little bit harder!
[34:10.12]Here we go.
[34:15.02]Alright, this thing is much better.
[34:17.95]That's fucked up.
[34:19.07]That is, that's pretty fucked up.
[34:20.29]Alright, what was, what was, there's something glowing over here.
[34:24.96]Is this, what is this, fresh grass?
[34:27.30]Start, turn to spread terror.
[34:30.18]Oh, these are missions.
[34:34.28]Ah, okay.
[34:36.53]So they kind of just spread out random missions.
[34:44.83]Get that one.
[34:46.21]Start rural race.
[34:48.99]Start that business, dude.
[34:51.83]Charge it.
[34:52.21]I'm gonna do a full charge.
[34:55.53]Alright, that's good.
[34:58.27]That one's a... Ow, that was 25 DNA.
[34:59.67]Alright, let me try it.
[35:02.29]Let's do it in rural race.
[35:06.20]I wish to test your observational skills, Crypto.
[35:08.22]Race to the locations I tell you as quickly as possible.
[35:11.82]Got two minutes.
[35:13.04]175 DNA.
[35:15.05]Go to the checkpoint fast.
[35:16.55]Got it.
[35:21.15]There are a lot of people here.
[35:22.25]I don't need to kill anybody.
[35:28.92]Just go.
[35:33.20]Two minutes to touch all these things and get a ton of DNA.
[35:41.26]Does it fall damage?
[35:50.18]Stormtrooper aim.
[35:52.44]Uh-oh.
[35:53.34]We've got people.
[35:54.25]Oh, shit.
[35:54.53]There are three of you.
[35:55.33]Four of you, actually.
[35:56.21]Did I kill him?
[35:59.05]All right.
[35:59.59]Touch it.
[36:12.49]No, no, I don't have time to do that DNA.
[36:17.86]Yes, and drowning.
[36:18.80]Okay.
[36:19.98]That's good to know.
[36:20.54]I don't have very much time left.
[36:23.48]I gotta go.
[36:24.58]Ooh, don't fall in the river.
[36:31.73]What is that?
[36:33.09]What is this thing?
[36:34.79]One of twenty... Whoa.
[36:36.37]I probed it.
[36:38.23]Race for the finish line.
[36:39.03]Woo!
[36:45.11]30 seconds.
[36:51.13]Flying colors.
[36:51.63]175 DNA.
[36:52.57]He's calling me a commie.
[37:02.60]You can select the next mission, buy upgrades, and view the archives from the Furon mothership.
[37:06.14]You can return to the mothership by pressing the start button, then selecting return to mothership.
[37:11.81]When you're ready.
[37:12.55]I mean, maybe I'm not quite ready yet, though.
[37:15.57]I want to see other things.
[37:16.33]Hold on.
[37:19.07]Let's see what she knows.
[37:19.73]Well, your biological clock is up.
[37:22.25]Thanks for the DNA.
[37:23.63]What's this one?
[37:24.29]Smart Armageddon.
[37:42.43]Crypto, I've had enough of this accursed town.
[37:44.05]Destroy all the buildings.
[37:45.31]Leave no trace.
[37:46.22]Yeah, 200 DNA.
[37:47.26]You kidding me?
[37:48.46]Oh!
[37:50.98]Go, go, go, go, go.
[37:56.00]It's not an emulator?
[37:56.86]No, this is on PSN.
[38:00.41]This is the current... Upgraded version from the PlayStation.
[38:04.97]From PlayStation 4.
[38:09.75]Alright.
[38:10.42]Let's start from left to right.
[38:15.75]That one.
[38:16.37]Get rid of this.
[38:19.60]Come on.
[38:19.94]I can see the health bar.
[38:20.66]Gotta watch the cooldown period.
[38:25.72]We got siloed.
[38:29.32]Coming all the way down there.
[38:30.26]Got destroyed.
[38:33.67]Oh, this is gonna be tough.
[38:35.59]I don't have any upgrades.
[38:37.17]I think I'll still be able to do it, though.
[38:42.97]Left or right?
[38:46.93]Ah, that isn't quite left to right.
[38:49.37]What the fuck is that?
[38:53.66]Oh, God.
[38:55.08]This is all so spread out.
[38:58.08]Oh, my God.
[38:58.68]I did this so wrong.
[38:59.98]It's alright.
[39:03.00]Somebody is shooting nuclear bombs at me.
[39:06.62]And I happen to just be missing them.
[39:15.01]Three more buildings.
[39:15.63]I got it.
[39:19.15]Ow.
[39:20.69]I told you I was gonna cry.
[39:24.87]Who's that?
[39:26.81]Guy with a shotgun?
[39:28.09]Oh, it's like a Samsung.
[39:34.14]Got it.
[39:34.36]Get out of here.
[39:39.76]Mmm, got one minute.
[39:40.94]Come on.
[39:41.24]Whoa!
[39:47.80]Is that gonna spin around and hit me?
[39:50.30]Wow!
[39:51.04]I'm almost dead.
[39:52.82]I'm almost dead.
[39:54.00]Alright.
[39:54.22]I'm a little fooling around.
[39:56.91]Oh, shit.
[39:57.85]Oh, shit.
[39:58.51]Oh, shit.
[40:04.47]I'm okay.
[40:06.66]Ah!
[40:08.66]Asshole.
[40:13.39]Got it.
[40:14.37]Yeah!
[40:14.61]200 DNA.
[40:14.97]That was close.
[40:17.35]It's gonna explode, just... Woo-hoo-hoo.
[40:23.41]Woo-hoo-hoo.
[40:25.39]Old games were hard.
[40:41.52]Yes, they were.
[40:42.14]Alright, where's this pointing me?
[40:43.08]Alright, this triangle is a little odd considering it's a triangle in every direction.
[40:49.81]Okay, I see you.
[40:50.49]It's pointing that way.
[40:58.37]That was too close.
[41:01.26]I'm one of those weirdos, man.
[41:02.26]When you give me a game with upgrades like this, I want to do everything.
[41:05.74]I want to be really weak and then dump a million points in.
[41:11.04]Turn to the end.
[41:11.50]So this thing is... Is it repaired now?
[41:15.58]Should be, right?
[41:16.06]Let's go look over here.
[41:24.85]What is this one?
[41:28.45]No, no.
[41:28.87]That's far away.
[41:29.41]I gotta get back in the ship.
[41:35.03]Don't let this be another seven hour stream.
[41:38.74]Why not?
[41:40.22]I'm not saying it's gonna be seven hours, but... I mean... That's a bad thing?
[41:49.69]The arrow is currently fucked, though.
[41:50.91]Uhh... How do I repair this?
[42:01.18]I thought... Isn't that a repair or something?
[42:04.56]That doesn't repair?
[42:06.44]Okay, well it's gonna fucking explode.
[42:16.23]I gotta destroy the tank that's over here.
[42:19.05]Before this thing dies.
[42:19.85]I could just... turn them on the ship.
[42:30.99]I guess that's what we're doing.
[42:33.19]Seven hours of anal probing.
[42:39.49]Congratulations!
[42:40.05]New mission available!
[42:42.27]Am I gonna complete this?
[42:54.06]Maybe.
[42:54.22]I mean, if I have fun and it keeps me interested, then yeah.
[42:56.38]I don't know why I wouldn't.
[42:57.38]I have Destroy All Humans 2 as well.
[42:59.00]So we'll see.
[42:59.34]And... Nubile.
[43:21.00]You don't like how his mouth is the only thing moving?
[43:23.88]One thing led to another.
[43:25.30]Long story short, every human being alive today has buried deep in his genetic code a strand of Furon DNA.
[43:36.84]Over the eons, we've learned to clone ourselves, but with each iteration, the information degrades, and the results are increasingly unpredictable.
[43:45.59]The Furon genes in humanity's DNA are ancient, uncorrupted,
[43:51.04]They represent the future of the Furon race.
[43:54.34]If only we can get at them.
[43:55.96]Alright, I get you.
[43:58.85]So let's go to the lab.
[43:59.95]Let's see what I got.
[44:01.63]I have like a thousand something.
[44:04.01]Did you want a saucer upgrade?
[44:06.15]Or something a little more personal?
[44:09.13]Upgrade saucer or upgrade me?
[44:11.15]Let's go with me first.
[44:13.39]Weapons and abilities.
[44:14.80]Wise choice.
[44:16.56]It might stop you getting killed by the humans so often.
[44:22.00]Okay.
[44:23.34]Specification unavailable.
[44:25.50]Unavailable.
[44:27.72]Researching new weapon.
[44:30.72]Researching new weapon.
[44:34.57]I can't do anything.
[44:38.55]What about the ship?
[44:40.69]Specification unavailable.
[44:51.23]researching specification unavailable researching researching researching I can't do anything I'm just gonna play so what would you like to up all right let's go all right here we go we got rockwell earth women are delicious sure thing
[45:27.26]There's nothing unlocked after the tutorial?
[45:29.55]What the fuck?
[45:30.31]What the hell?
[45:30.79]Oh my god, okay.
[45:31.23]So I have to go- I have to go kidnap somebody?
[45:33.57]Has humans become aware of the chaos crypto is causing?
[45:55.95]Exclamation icons will appear above their heads.
[45:58.35]As more humans become aware, the alert level will be raised, and ever-increasing waves of authorities will hunt Crypto down.
[46:04.43]The four icons at the top of the screen show the current alert level.
[46:08.15]The alert level will slowly drop over time.
[46:12.74]So, enter the fair.
[46:16.28]Alright, so I gotta be sneaky about this.
[46:24.22]Holobob!
[46:26.14]To take a holobob disguise, target a human with the crosshair and press the circle button.
[46:35.23]Oh, that really needed a little bit of punctuation.
[46:37.67]To take a holobob disguise target... To take a holobob disguise... To take a holobob disguise, target a human with the crosshair and press circle.
[46:48.01]Once you are projecting the holobob illusion, most humans will no longer see you as an alien.
[46:53.39]See, it's like Hitman, okay.
[46:56.58]Illusion drains.
[46:57.30]Concentration.
[46:58.65]Cortex scan.
[46:59.43]Humans for more concentration.
[47:00.81]Okay.
[47:04.13]So, a holobob, this guy?
[47:09.37]Oh, wait.
[47:10.65]I'm just... Wait, I get it now.
[47:12.25]So, I'm you.
[47:17.56]Oh, why?
[47:19.42]Alright, walking up to people and holding my hands up against my head and looking at them intently...
[47:26.16]Well, I guess there's nothing wrong with animals peaceably organizing.
[47:30.04]After all, it is an animal farm.
[47:34.35]You just have to keep scanning people.
[47:36.05]Does anybody get suspicious of you?
[47:38.97]Like the police officer, will he get suspicious?
[47:40.33]There's a screenplay in this.
[47:41.81]Yo, yo, yo, Serpico.
[47:43.53]Oops.
[47:43.83]Sorry.
[47:46.85]You can use your cortex scan ability to gain concentration.
[47:51.13]Remain disguised for longer.
[47:53.27]Yeah.
[47:54.01]Suck on their thoughts.
[47:55.67]What we need is the dumbest, weakest-willed, most malleable human we can find.
[48:01.36]Admittedly, the competition will be fierce.
[48:04.28]You just have to scan them all.
[48:07.47]How dumb is this guy?
[48:08.39]Man, oh man.
[48:09.41]She may be the dumbest Miss Rockwell ever.
[48:12.43]Check out them cantaloupes.
[48:14.51]God, I love America.
[48:15.78]Well, this guy is definitely pretty dumb.
[48:17.24]Alright, who else?
[48:17.78]Oh, fuck this backyard barbecue bullshit.
[48:20.76]I don't want nothing to do with that.
[48:37.06]Okay, what about you guys?
[48:38.02]That's a do not extract.
[48:40.36]I want to marry Miss Rockwell, but instead I gotta sit here hour after hour, day after day, watching this dying wheel go up and down, round and round, over and over again until somebody dies.
[48:52.26]Hell of a metaphor.
[48:54.00]Apparently she's the dumb one.
[48:55.10]Yes, yes!
[48:56.04]Like proteins from the primordial ooze, a pattern is emerging.
[49:00.64]Scan some more human minds, crypto!
[49:04.11]Tiny new automobile, check.
[49:05.65]Wife cooking meatloaf, taking Valium, check.
[49:08.55]Monotonous job as fly linker, check.
[49:11.41]Unriddled inner rage hidden just below the surface of normalcy, check.
[49:15.53]That seems like a pretty good candidate, but who are you?
[49:18.69]Who are you?
[49:26.00]All right, Crypto.
[49:27.38]I've analyzed all the thoughts you've collected, and I think I've isolated the perfect subject for you to probe and vaporize.
[49:35.71]No.
[49:36.95]Abduct and bring back to the mothership.
[49:39.07]My way's more fun.
[49:41.49]Abduct, not vaporize.
[49:44.71]Okay, but humanity ain't gonna annihilate itself, all I'm saying.
[49:50.19]Can I finish?
[49:51.27]Can I stop you?
[49:52.93]Is this guy Wolverine?
[49:53.63]I want this guy to do Wolverine.
[49:55.17]The newly crowned Miss Rockwell looks like a prime candidate for testing.
[50:00.48]She's envied and desired by other humans.
[50:02.84]She's highly persuadable.
[50:04.82]Best of all, she apparently has a brain the size of a peanut.
[50:09.38]Hypnotize her and send her back to your ship for collection.
[50:12.70]Okay.
[50:16.20]Hypnoblast.
[50:16.84]Target a human and press and hold the L1 button.
[50:20.26]Press square to hypnoblast.
[50:22.02]Hypnotize the target by pressing and holding the square button.
[50:24.78]Commands can then be implanted into the mind of the target.
[50:28.40]Keep an eye out for humans with special hypno commands.
[50:31.13]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:32.07]Town's doing great.
[50:33.03]Business is booming.
[50:33.83]Hope is on the way.
[50:34.73]Yada, yada, yada.
[50:36.25]Let's barrel through this puppy so I can get down.
[50:38.11]Can I make them run into each other?
[50:40.03]Making time with the delicious Miss Rockwell.
[50:42.43]Hold on.
[50:43.01]Hypno.
[50:45.78]OH THAT'S TAKING TOO MUCH OF MY SPIR- THAT'S TAKING- OH SHIT!
[50:49.71]STANDARD BRAIN!
[50:50.27]Alright, I'm fine.
[50:51.25]I just made that guy dance.
[50:52.91]Okay, where is she?
[50:54.05]In here?
[50:54.59]Is she inside?
[50:56.43]Where is she?
[50:57.45]She's in the tent.
[51:14.28]Alright, I need to be careful.
[51:15.56]I need to get some... That takes a lot of brain power.
[51:21.24]Alright, here we go.
[51:26.41]Hip the top.
[51:29.61]Walk to saucer.
[51:31.07]Distraction.
[51:31.81]Sleep.
[51:32.35]Yeah, walk to saucer.
[51:35.03]Yeah, Miss Rockwell to the saucer.
[51:37.25]Alright, I gotta scan somebody before my disguise is broken.
[51:41.55]Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back.
[51:44.23]The two sexiest words in the English language.
[51:47.39]Stocks and... It's like we traveled to a future where TV was in color, and they made a program about our happy days in Santa Modesta.
[51:56.90]Where is she going?
[51:57.44]Are you going the right way?
[51:58.18]I don't remember parking here.
[52:02.74]Watson Elvis.
[52:04.40]Must be a new type of 10-gallon hat.
[52:06.96]I want to slap an Elvis on my head.
[52:09.02]All right, I got her.
[52:13.93]Stocks and bonds.
[52:14.85]It was stocks and bonds.
[52:17.33]It's the two sexiest words in the English language.
[52:19.91]Speaking of... What?
[52:22.92]Oh, okay.
[52:25.48]People are just having sex in these cars over here.
[52:28.04]Why are they parked next to each other?
[52:37.65]This sure doesn't look like the pie-eating contest.
[52:42.99]Uh-oh.
[52:44.33]Uh-oh.
[52:45.03]What's happening?
[52:46.01]Oh, God, please, no.
[52:48.50]Oh, oh, it tickles.
[52:55.34]It's probing time.
[52:57.04]I don't think you'd be that excited about this.
[52:59.28]Oh, that is delicious.
[53:03.75]So vocal, so responsive.
[53:06.81]Okay.
[53:07.43]This is going to be good.
[53:11.31]I think the last thing I would say while being sucked into a UFO is, oh yeah, that's great.
[53:16.16]I like that.
[53:18.16]Hurry, Crypto.
[53:19.14]The authorities are on their way.
[53:21.02]Get in your saucer.
[53:24.92]Get the sensor bar ready.
[53:25.96]Let's go.
[53:31.96]Now let's pull down the beam and drag it across the whole landscape.
[53:38.26]Destroy the fair.
[53:39.82]So I can just get rid of people.
[53:57.01]Yeah, that was a secret agent.
[53:59.47]The guy was on fire.
[54:00.35]How could he be aware of my presence?
[54:01.51]Well, I guess he would be aware if he's currently on fire.
[54:05.75]Check out the military.
[54:09.15]Ow.
[54:12.90]There's no time limit, so I don't have to be present.
[54:19.26]Goddamn.
[54:25.07]Oh, goddamn.
[54:25.73]All right, I'm fine.
[54:30.53]Come on, charge it!
[54:32.65]Uh, there's a lot here.
[54:40.03]Go, get all these people.
[54:51.06]So, what does four stars mean?
[54:53.12]If that's police, then what is the other one?
[54:57.12]Alright, I gotta get rid of this next wave of, uh...
[55:01.12]tanks and shit over here.
[55:02.70]I want to go down there and harvest DNA.
[55:11.48]Big cup.
[55:11.90]Alright, not much left.
[55:12.80]Just a ferris wheel.
[55:15.78]Goodbye.
[55:16.34]Secret service.
[55:36.65]How much DNA did I get for that?
[55:37.87]A lot?
[55:40.59]Ooh.
[55:41.65]No.
[55:43.78]Okay.
[55:44.46]Spice Invaders!
[55:46.80]Disaster at Rockwell Fair.
[55:48.10]Fairground left in tatters by freak storm.
[55:53.12]That's not good.
[55:54.68]When you're ready, return to the mothership for your next mission.
[55:57.12]Whoa, we gotta... Hold on.
[55:59.28]I kind of want to get on here and just suck out brains.
[56:00.96]What do you think?
[56:02.56]Should I do that?
[56:05.71]There are a lot of random dead bodies, aren't there?
[56:08.39]Or is that just not worth killing?
[56:10.31]Oh, there are other little missions, too.
[56:13.67]I want to check out one of the other missions.
[56:18.78]I'm curious.
[56:23.56]This is the last one.
[56:24.46]Where are you?
[56:24.96]Right here?
[56:26.42]I think the first thing I want to upgrade, I think, is the laser here.
[56:33.89]It depletes very quickly.
[56:39.47]Now he's going to hide.
[56:40.37]Go hide somewhere.
[56:41.61]Give me a place to land.
[56:44.85]Give me a spot I can land.
[56:50.17]No more military.
[57:03.95]I wonder if I should just land.
[57:04.97]Just go walk around.
[57:07.77]Hiding in a flying saucer.
[57:19.00]Just out of curiosity, I want to go see.
[57:22.84]No, I can put on somebody's dumb disguise, right?
[57:24.49]Because there are other things I can do over there.
[57:31.37]Plus, there are weird little bots I can pick up.
[57:34.19]I got rid of most of the military.
[57:36.77]See, here we go.
[57:38.49]Oh, shit.
[57:39.05]Can you see me?
[57:43.34]I can't... No, I want to... Can I make him on my team?
[57:54.18]Distraction, sleep, distraction.
[57:56.42]Okay, you can do a distraction.
[58:05.63]Oh, get over the... Get over it!
[58:07.33]Oh, get over the hill!
[58:17.57]Suck your brain out.
[58:22.00]Gives you a ton of DNA.
[58:26.68]What gives you a ton of DNA?
[58:28.64]And a jetpack.
[58:29.66]Well, I got stuck on the wall.
[58:31.88]Oh, wow.
[58:34.58]Those things do give you like 100 DNA.
[58:36.01]Cool.
[58:36.93]Let's do some probing.
[58:38.79]What was the...
[58:43.27]What was the way to turn into this mega disguise?
[58:46.36]Gonna marry you.
[58:47.42]Oh, god damn it.
[58:47.94]That's gotta go up his ass, come on.
[58:52.60]You still alive?
[58:55.51]Fuck.
[58:55.83]Come over here!
[59:14.86]Alright, I got it under control.
[59:29.85]So, purple brains versus... It's 25, okay.
[59:35.64]Probe immunity.
[59:36.46]Some of them seem to have larger... ...anuses.
[59:40.10]I don't know if that makes any sense, but it should.
[59:44.83]Alright, I want to do a mission.
[59:45.77]These are really far away.
[59:51.56]We're on the bridge.
[59:52.12]No, no, no.
[59:52.54]Get this little guy.
[59:54.84]There we go.
[59:58.96]75.
[59:59.34]Ow.
[60:00.18]That did almost half my health.
[60:01.86]Be careful.
[60:02.64]Just take out the threats first.
[60:13.73]Alright, here we go.
[60:14.25]Let's do a mission.
[60:15.37]This is... Start rock... Oh, this is just the race.
[60:19.12]Okay.
[60:21.58]How much DNA is it?
[60:23.84]175.
[60:23.94]No, what are the other ones?
[60:26.36]Can I probe the car?
[60:30.31]No.
[60:32.13]You cannot anally probe a car.
[60:33.95]What does that even mean?
[60:36.71]Like, I stuff a probe in a gas tank?
[60:43.17]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:44.97]Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[60:48.26]Time to go.
[60:49.22]There's another one over here.
[60:51.40]Alright, what is this one?
[60:59.74]Rockwell Rampage.
[61:00.78]That's destroying everything.
[61:01.74]I guess it's the same little side missions in every town.
[61:06.56]Armageddon.
[61:07.60]Alright, whatever this last one is, is what I'm going to do.
[61:13.43]Yeah, I guess you can just do, destroy the town, race around the town.
[61:20.67]Collecting all these would be kind of a pain in the ass.
[61:23.43]There's a lot of them in this level.
[61:25.97]Alright.
[61:27.81]Rockwell Barbecue.
[61:28.81]Is that cow mocking me?
[61:30.01]Destroy it.
[61:31.67]And the other bovine conspirators.
[61:34.03]Destroy six cows.
[61:41.03]I don't know if a cow is sounding like this, but that's okay.
[61:44.19]Well, this is very easy.
[61:47.95]Okay, that's the easiest 200 DNA I'm ever gonna get.
[61:52.56]Alright, let's go with... gas tank.
[62:11.89]Blow up the gas station.
[62:15.09]Blow up the gas station!
[62:17.01]Come on!
[62:17.53]What?
[62:17.67]You can't blow up the gas station!
[62:18.94]What kind of GTA game is this?
[62:24.06]Back to the ship.
[62:31.22]I need more juice than that.
[62:34.64]Back to ship.
[62:35.40]Wait.
[62:35.86]Yeah, of course there's going to be one in here.
[62:41.55]With those screaming goat noises, probably I wouldn't be surprised.
[62:51.22]Holy shit!
[62:53.34]Oh my god!
[62:54.14]Distraction!
[62:57.56]Time to move, time to move.
[62:59.08]You don't have authorization to leave.
[63:02.00]Return to the mission area at once.
[63:04.44]You have returned to the invasion site.
[63:09.02]That thing always seems to be pointing me in the wrong direction.
[63:14.33]Because this is the invasion site over here.
[63:18.69]Every collective will get every single thing.
[63:20.73]100% completion.
[63:28.21]Make out point.
[63:32.17]Close enough.
[63:38.17]I guess I can't just do this.
[63:40.97]I can.
[63:41.41]Okay.
[63:43.05]Return to the mothership.
[63:50.49]So you don't have to get back to the... You can do it from anywhere.
[63:52.39]Okay.
[63:54.79]Good to know.
[63:59.04]Here we go.
[63:59.70]Pox is always researching new technology.
[64:01.58]The gadgets he creates allow Crypto to upgrade his gun, the saucer, and his PK ability.
[64:07.06]Pox is a bit of a mercenary.
[64:08.84]He'll only outfit you with some of the upgrades if you slip him some DNA for his own personal stash.
[64:14.46]Purchase at Pox's lab.
[64:15.52]Keep an eye out for new ones each time you return to the mothership.
[64:17.98]Alright.
[64:19.10]Here we go.
[64:21.15]It's time for some upgrades.
[64:22.43]Okay.
[64:23.99]Zap-o-matic.
[64:24.69]So there's two heroes.
[64:25.45]250 DNA.
[64:26.54]Chain lightning to one additional target.
[64:28.66]Cool.
[64:42.51]Researching specification unavailable.
[64:45.35]So I can only do this.
[64:47.83]Oh, no, no, no.
[64:48.23]Here we go.
[64:48.97]Pick up vehicles.
[64:50.73]There's Psychokinetic.
[64:53.45]Pick up vehicles or more lightning.
[64:56.77]Or... Check out this one.
[65:02.80]100% the game will delete your Twitch account.
[65:07.84]Come on.
[65:08.34]I can't do anything?
[65:09.94]Both unavailable?
[65:11.73]Well, I kind of want to pick up cars.
[65:15.47]Yeah, pick up cars.
[65:18.45]Thank you.
[65:21.05]This is next.
[65:24.26]Researching a new upgrade so I can pick up cars.
[65:26.50]I can do them both.
[65:28.84]Why don't I just do both?
[65:33.00]Yeah, just do them both.
[65:35.37]Chain lightning?
[65:36.15]That sounds good.
[65:37.45]That's all I can do now, anyways.
[65:42.04]Alright.
[65:44.28]Saving data.
[65:49.46]Back to the hangar.
[65:50.22]We have a new place to go, do we?
[65:52.81]Citizens Crypto.
[65:54.87]Terrorized... No, okay.
[65:56.25]So, I got something new here?
[65:59.73]Maybe I didn't get enough DNA to go in this place.
[66:07.80]What are they currently zapping into?
[66:09.20]Is that Mexico?
[66:14.84]Those nearby bovoids are emitting unusual levels of radiation!
[66:19.98]Stop wasting time and investigate them immediately!
[66:23.66]Radioactive cows?
[66:28.12]I'm so excited!
[66:31.12]Suck out their radioactive juice.
[66:32.44]Scan a radioactive cow.
[66:33.70]No police awareness.
[66:36.96]Okay.
[66:37.20]I don't see any cops.
[66:39.57]Are there cow police?
[66:42.37]Brains.
[66:43.21]Kill the scientists.
[66:44.55]No police awareness.
[66:45.41]No, cannot alert the crowd.
[66:46.62]I thought cows couldn't speak English.
[67:09.63]Alright, no police alertions.
[67:11.96]Alertions?
[67:13.82]No police alertions.
[67:15.20]Alright, let me uh... Okay, here we go.
[67:19.28]Alright, I'm one of you.
[67:22.30]No police awareness.
[67:24.08]Let's think how we're gonna do this.
[67:27.17]Wait, who the fuck am I?
[67:28.09]Am I like Albert Einstein?
[67:32.32]I gotta tell him to stop right there.
[67:37.14]What the fuck?
[67:39.12]What are you doing?
[67:41.24]Why did he do that?
[67:41.80]He just shot that Albert Einstein guy and then came after me.
[67:48.45]Wait, are they gonna know it's me?
[67:54.71]I'm just really smart.
[67:56.25]That's why I can do this.
[68:02.87]Oh shit!
[68:15.98]Fuck!
[68:16.78]That's gonna kill him, right?
[68:20.30]Alright, yeah.
[68:22.16]I win.
[68:25.30]Why did he start shooting at me?
[68:29.46]Did I lose?
[68:34.38]No.
[68:36.38]Man, uh, mayor calls town meeting.
[68:38.38]Plans to finally explain what's going on.
[68:41.34]Where did he come from?
[68:43.30]Never mind that.
[68:44.44]You must stop him before he publicly reveals your existence.
[68:54.63]God damn it.
[68:55.07]I'm not gonna get everyone to know it's me.
[68:56.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:57.51]Come here, come here, come here.
[68:58.17]Come here.
[69:13.51]I'm not very good at this part.
[69:16.41]It's okay.
[69:17.89]All right, we gotta holobomb the mayor.
[69:20.56]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[69:22.28]Get away from the police.
[69:25.16]No, no, no, no, I'm fine.
[69:33.12]We're fine.
[69:33.62]We made it.
[69:40.62]Oh!
[69:42.18]Wait, car!
[69:46.94]Oh, well.
[69:50.14]All right, Hollabob.
[69:51.60]Hollabob the mayor.
[69:52.76]There he is.
[70:06.87]Alright, there he is.
[70:08.55]All above him.
[70:11.09]That's, no, that's fucking police officer shit.
[70:17.78]Alright, now watch me.
[70:19.02]I did it.
[70:20.70]He's goofy in this.
[70:21.56]It's actually goofy.
[70:22.84]It's actually goofy.
[70:34.95]I really think it is.
[70:35.93]I told Edgar, there goes our savings.
[70:38.77]No new shoes for the twins.
[70:40.59]Well, I can't believe it.
[70:42.11]That's Sora.
[70:44.11]Nobody can do goofy besides the guy that does goofy.
[70:47.91]There is nothing going on here.
[70:49.91]Everything is normal.
[70:51.53]Carry on with your pathetic human lives.
[70:54.31]That is all.
[70:55.41]Now wait just a cock picking minute.
[70:58.03]Mr. Mayor, I've lived in this town all my life.
[71:00.55]And I voted for you twice in the last election.
[71:03.80]What the fuck was that?
[71:05.24]Pretend that was very, very suspicious.
[71:07.60]Pretend glowing is normal.
[71:08.76]Deny alien involvement.
[71:09.34]Feign ignorance.
[71:09.90]Tell the truth.
[71:25.52]Why the hell do you think they're glowing?
[71:27.86]They've been probed.
[71:29.53]That's a stinking lie.
[71:31.15]I didn't touch them cows.
[71:32.57]They liked it.
[71:33.01]Actually, not like that.
[71:34.69]That's sick.
[71:36.07]And anyway, Dr. Kinsey says it's normal to just get those damn bourgeois attitudes out of my bedroom.
[71:43.59]I mean my barn.
[71:45.79]What?
[71:47.65]Deny everything.
[71:48.89]Flame weather balloons.
[71:50.25]Flame communism.
[71:52.25]Threaten audience.
[71:53.91]What's going on around here?
[71:55.73]I could tell you, but then I'd have to vaporize you.
[71:58.68]Crowd is not happy.
[72:07.38]Oh, ramble.
[72:08.12]As a matter of fact, this is a particularly good time of year for amateur astronomers.
[72:12.77]Venus is generally visible in the evening, and of course, we have the Leonid media shower coming up in a few weeks.
[72:22.61]Okay, I can't fuck it up again.
[72:23.80]I don't know.
[72:25.34]Tell a Jew.
[72:26.10]Listen, you've been a great audience.
[72:27.50]Don't forget to tip the veal and try the wafers.
[72:30.08]And if you liked what you heard, throw me a bone and vote for me next election day.
[72:34.31]Early and often.
[72:35.57]Ah, shit, they don't like it.
[72:38.67]How in the world does any of that explain the destruction at the fair?
[72:45.00]It's an alien!
[72:50.06]Oh no.
[72:50.84]You're gonna have to be vaporized.
[72:53.70]Oh, fuck.
[72:56.36]May really have midget disgraced politician run out of town by mob.
[73:05.69]When you're ready, return to the... Oh.
[73:08.19]Whoa!
[73:09.39]Whoa!
[73:10.85]Everybody calm down!
[73:22.05]I don't know what I'm doing.
[73:33.89]I'm fine.
[73:35.61]That newspaper got circulated really quickly.
[73:38.70]It's me.
[73:39.40]You.
[73:40.88]Get the fuck out of here.
[73:42.98]Strange occurrences reported.
[73:45.02]Patrol's ordered to keep an eye
[73:51.20]Don't worry.
[73:52.40]Okay.
[73:54.10]It's just me.
[73:57.99]Cowboy John.
[73:59.25]You all know me.
[74:02.41]Oh!
[74:06.73]I can't pick up the fucking car.
[74:08.11]I wasn't paying attention to the meter.
[74:15.91]Wait a minute.
[74:16.47]What happened?
[74:16.99]Why did that guy get shot with a tank?
[74:21.07]What?
[74:23.35]Okay, that guy got shot directly in the head by a tank.
[74:27.77]Oh!
[74:29.95]Oh, I'm just doing the checkpoint race.
[74:36.14]What is with this aim?
[74:37.86]You're not that good.
[74:39.70]You can't be that good.
[74:44.94]Checkpoint.
[74:45.46]Main Street.
[74:52.02]I need some... I need some goddamn cryptocurrency, alright?
[74:55.02]Oof!
[75:00.05]What the hell?
[75:00.83]What the hell, man?
[75:02.07]What the hell?
[75:03.57]Alright, I need to slow down.
[75:13.79]Just gotta get across.
[75:16.75]Should be fairly close here.
[75:20.77]I just got hair shot.
[75:23.40]Oh, fuck.
[75:30.04]I'm so glad they have really bad... Just dodge!
[75:33.22]Wait till I get the health bar.
[75:44.21]I'm just making it so easy to be shot.
[75:46.03]Just stay down for a second.
[75:52.16]What's that thing?
[75:54.42]What's that thing?
[75:54.96]Get it.
[75:57.42]What's that thing?
[75:59.83]Am I missing this?
[76:00.89]Or am I... I don't know what it is, but I can't get it.
[76:06.55]Apparently it's a battery, full battery, 15 seconds.
[76:17.38]Got it.
[76:19.72]175 DNA.
[76:24.16]Ammo for a different gun.
[76:25.06]Oh, okay.
[76:27.10]What?
[76:28.26]Oh, no.
[76:28.50]What's going on?
[76:29.65]Okay.
[76:29.77]Alright.
[76:32.67]I got a shield here.
[76:33.87]Really?
[76:43.77]Fucking really?
[76:44.83]Really?
[76:45.15]F-word?
[76:46.87]Really?
[76:47.07]You're gonna use the F-word?
[76:49.36]Oh, I'm dead.
[76:53.62]Okay.
[76:54.94]Why do I still have this stupid thing on the screen?
[77:00.09]Wow!
[77:02.83]Alright, can I hide here for a second?
[77:05.87]Who can I disguise as?
[77:12.17]Okay.
[77:13.57]Let's cool down for a second here.
[77:19.40]Watch out for that.
[77:26.08]Are you kidding me?
[77:28.40]I just got PUBG'd.
[77:30.34]Some guy has had their sights on me for the last, like, 30 minutes while I go and pick up, like, cans of soup and shit.
[77:37.51]Just waiting for me to come out of the house.
[77:39.33]Oh, fuck.
[77:39.93]They're right here.
[77:46.26]Alright, how do I get her to this thing?
[77:48.64]This thing on the screen is annoying.
[77:49.92]Nice video game reference.
[77:53.30]I know sometimes you gotta give a video game reference.
[77:55.14]Okay, scan.
[77:58.90]Alright, just make it... make it to this ship.
[78:03.47]Or do I want to... I need more DNA.
[78:15.00]I wish there was just a haymaker button, you know what I'm saying?
[78:18.75]Just a wild right-handed swing.
[78:23.91]It's pretty deep.
[78:26.43]Alright, we're good.
[78:32.51]Through here... I'm gonna do another mission.
[78:34.45]I need more DNA.
[78:35.37]Was this Armageddon?
[78:38.75]Well, I can't let this person see me, so...
[78:42.16]Let's hypnotize.
[78:44.60]Distraction, sleep.
[78:45.78]Okay, go to sleep.
[78:52.02]Oh, shit.
[78:52.92]That crowd is still there.
[78:53.88]Can I bolt?
[78:59.30]Let's see if I can get a strike.
[79:00.24]Ooh, that's a broken head.
[79:02.45]That's a broken neck.
[79:03.19]There we go.
[79:19.73]Well, it didn't quite work out as what I intended to do.
[79:24.11]But, it's alright.
[79:27.25]I wonder if it's the guy doing the nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh with his head.
[79:30.06]Start Armageddon.
[79:32.36]Destroy all buildings, leave no trace.
[79:34.40]200 DNA.
[79:34.52]Huh.
[79:46.96]Oh, man.
[79:47.80]This doesn't... This doesn't go as well.
[79:50.20]I need my ship.
[79:51.42]Can I sabotage this thing?
[79:57.96]Alright.
[79:58.14]Well, I gotta take off the disguise.
[80:05.81]Drop the frames?
[80:06.63]Yeah.
[80:07.77]It'll happen from time to time here.
[80:08.95]I think I'm... I don't think I can have enough time to do this.
[80:15.54]Yep.
[80:16.80]That good old fixed internet sure is showing its ugly face, isn't it?
[80:24.00]Nah, you know what?
[80:24.82]Let's just go back.
[80:25.81]Turn the mother ship.
[80:28.45]I mean, I failed the mission.
[80:29.37]Do I have to do it again?
[80:30.29]Does this game just keep going?
[80:41.04]If you fail something, you just keep going.
[80:43.24]Alright, can't do anything else.
[80:47.22]Pick up vehicles.
[80:48.34]Why can I not do that, though?
[80:50.40]Already got it, right?
[80:53.78]Alright, let's see.
[80:56.31]Hangar.
[80:56.73]Yeah, I guess I have to just do it again.
[81:00.39]Yeah, alright.
[81:00.95]I gotta get it right this time.
[81:07.13]Impersonate, and then I've gotta make the crowd love me.
[81:11.21]Don't tell any jokes.
[81:12.91]Crypto, those nearby bovoids are emitting unusual levels of radiation.
[81:19.20]Stop wasting time and investigate them immediately.
[81:22.28]Yeah, we seem to have hit at least an hour there where it wasn't bad.
[81:33.31]But for some reason, I don't know why it is with this area.
[81:37.35]But the internet infrastructure here apparently was made in like 85 or like 86.
[81:44.31]And they're like all rusty and it's just a piece of shit.
[81:47.81]Guys, is this guy...
[82:00.41]Can I just, like, eat the brain of the scientist, like, right now?
[82:02.63]I can.
[82:04.37]Alright, well, where's that... I'm going to watch out for this guy.
[82:15.61]Nobody saw that.
[82:21.53]No, I want to target this guy.
[82:24.33]I want to target the guy up... Target this guy!
[82:33.52]How are you still alive?
[82:36.36]Alright, just pick him up.
[82:41.56]No more.
[82:42.36]Alright, he's dead.
[82:48.13]The internet tubes need to be flushed.
[82:57.59]Am I still doing it?
[82:58.63]Well, I lost and I had to restart it.
[83:02.85]They don't need to flush the internet tubes.
[83:05.29]They need to replace the entire infrastructure of the whole entire town.
[83:12.32]But that's not going to happen.
[83:14.18]Where did he come from?
[83:16.12]Never mind that.
[83:17.28]You must stop him before he publicly reveals your existence.
[83:20.86]Where did this guy go?
[83:23.94]Disguised as a cow.
[83:26.42]That'd be funny.
[83:28.50]Where is this guy?
[83:30.93]Disguised as one of these dudes right here.
[83:34.25]Come on.
[83:35.39]Close enough where I can get it.
[83:36.23]There it is.
[83:38.55]No, no, no, no.
[83:39.29]Get it.
[83:41.09]There.
[83:42.13]Okay, close enough.
[83:46.40]This time I'm not going to mess up the audience, the poll the audience.
[83:52.20]Nah, it's not OBS.
[83:53.36]If you haven't been around the last, like, six months, this whole entire, like, five mile radius is like a piece of absolute fucking junk.
[84:04.68]And it doesn't matter how many times a technician comes and fixes the internet, and fixes the whole street, and fixes the whole neighborhood, the whole thing fucks up over and over again.
[84:14.90]Okay, where is he?
[84:15.50]Right there.
[84:15.88]Hi.
[84:15.98]Speech time.
[84:21.45]Every one of the dang cows.
[84:23.03]Then it looked like it stuck some sort of device up the poor thing's... Move my house?
[84:27.71]I am... I'm moving to a different state.
[84:30.55]She just walked right on by with her... Within the next two months.
[84:36.54]I told Edgar, there goes our savings.
[84:39.48]No new shoes for the twins.
[84:41.20]And I guess Darlene's just gonna have to live another year with that overbuy.
[84:45.30]Greetings, fellow human agricultural engineers.
[84:48.64]There is nothing going on here.
[84:50.58]Everything is normal.
[84:52.21]Carry on with your pathetic human lives.
[84:54.99]That is all.
[84:56.09]Now, wait just a cotton-picking minute.
[84:58.69]Mr. Mayor, I've lived in this town all my life.
[85:01.05]Internet's worse there?
[85:01.73]In Vegas?
[85:04.35]You're talking about a city that is like the electrical internet probably capital of the whole country.
[85:11.33]It's like the Tokyo of the United States.
[85:14.71]That shit ain't turning off.
[85:15.67]Alright, give him the truth.
[85:18.84]Why the hell do you think they're glowing?
[85:21.16]They've been probed.
[85:22.82]That's a stinking lie.
[85:24.45]I didn't touch them cows.
[85:26.07]Especially not like that.
[85:28.01]That's sick.
[85:28.97]Plus, I believe that there's actual fiber internet.
[85:32.73]So if I have a 100 upload connection, it doesn't even matter.
[85:36.92]I mean my barn.
[85:39.10]What?
[85:41.49]You know what I mean?
[85:41.91]Like, if I have a straight-up fiber 100-up connection, that's not what I can get here.
[85:48.28]It's impossible.
[85:49.34]It is physically impossible for me to get more than, like, 15 to 20 up in this whole state.
[85:55.98]So, like, unless I go to, like, a few very specific places in this whole state, Comcast has, like, a Massachusetts monopoly on almost every single city and town.
[86:08.42]It's absurd.
[86:11.60]But anyways, blame communism.
[86:15.44]Let's blame communism.
[86:16.58]They liked it.
[86:27.83]Ramble incoherently.
[86:28.83]Act patriotic.
[86:30.09]Tell a joke.
[86:31.15]Insult audience.
[86:32.09]I mean, we're going to have to act patriotic.
[86:33.95]I don't know about you, but I'm not willing to see the land our forefathers fought and died for fall under the boot of the creeping red menace.
[86:41.26]Not on my watch.
[86:45.82]You know that internet's terrible in California?
[86:47.84]Well, I'm not moving to California.
[86:50.76]I'm moving to Nevada.
[86:52.30]Nevada.
[86:54.23]Tell a joke.
[86:54.87]Threaten communists.
[86:56.33]Discredit scientists.
[86:57.75]Enslave human populace.
[87:02.25]Should I insult the audience?
[87:06.19]I've got to threaten the communists, right?
[87:07.71]That makes more sense.
[87:10.62]So the next time you see a strange light moving and changing direction at incredible speed in the night sky...
[87:16.10]They all like that.
[87:17.34]Ignore the question.
[87:19.26]Blame it on bad luck.
[87:19.90]Make empty promises.
[87:20.66]Tell the truth.
[87:21.10]Hold on, we just go back and around the circle?
[87:22.93]Should I tell the truth?
[87:24.39]We just went in a full circle.
[87:50.37]That's so funny.
[87:52.17]Uh, well... We could make empty promises.
[87:57.34]For the truth.
[88:00.60]Empty promises.
[88:02.00]Read my lips.
[88:04.10]I will not rest until we find the perpetrators of the Fairground Carnage and bring him to justice.
[88:09.70]Well now, hold on!
[88:11.46]How come nobody in Santa Modeste has been seeing anything like this?
[88:17.25]Uh, feign ignorance.
[88:18.03]Reassure audience.
[88:18.89]Insult Santa Modesta.
[88:21.11]Blame cows.
[88:23.73]Feign ignorance is pretty good, I think.
[88:26.53]Or I could blame the cows.
[88:29.87]Cow scapegoat here?
[88:32.71]I think I'm going to feign ignorance.
[88:35.49]How the hell should I know?
[88:36.81]Oh, shit.
[88:42.18]I was going to blame the cows, too.
[88:45.32]They boo and then they clap.
[88:46.70]So, as you can see, there's nothing to trouble your puny human brains about.
[88:51.00]The mayor's right.
[88:53.30]This was all just a random series of suspiciously coincidental yet easily rationalized events.
[89:02.25]Yeah, that's right.
[89:03.29]Give it up.
[89:04.03]Let's hear it for me.
[89:04.77]Oh, man.
[89:07.43]My internet just went to zero.
[89:09.85]Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.
[89:13.09]Ah.
[89:14.96]What a bunch of losers.
[89:17.14]Mines like mud.
[89:18.91]This planet is easy pickings.
[89:21.47]Crypto!
[89:23.49]Did you hear what that human said during your speech?
[89:26.59]Must have missed it.
[89:28.17]Busy digging on the love.
[89:30.67]Focus!
[89:31.95]There's another human hive nearby.
[89:34.65]Santa Modesta, he called it.
[89:37.38]You must discover its location and make your way there.
[89:40.76]We've got more humans to control.
[89:43.81]What do we have?
[89:45.31]Like, maybe three weeks of no problems?
[89:49.47]And it's just back?
[89:51.35]Immediately?
[89:53.13]Not even, like, a full month.
[89:54.55]I didn't even get 30 days of, like, a, quote, fixed internet.
[90:03.28]That's such a joke.
[90:10.10]Not even that.
[90:11.44]It's been probably, like, maybe, yeah, just maybe three weeks.
[90:14.90]So we have like four months of problems.
[90:18.18]They fixed it for three weeks.
[90:19.54]And now here we go.
[90:20.24]Let's get another like... Until I move just to a different state.
[90:23.32]Let's have another like two or three months problems.
[90:29.04]Just use Verizon?
[90:29.92]I wish.
[90:30.78]I would pay five times my internet what the cost is right now.
[90:35.86]I'm not even kidding.
[90:37.14]I would pay five fucking times what I pay now.
[90:41.42]If I could get Verizon.
[90:44.08]I would do anything to dump Comcast and get Verizon Fios.
[90:47.88]I would pay 500 fucking dollars a month to get their basic package.
[90:52.71]Nope.
[90:53.45]Not even possible.
[90:57.01]Oh man, this is... This is getting worse.
[91:09.94]And also, this is on top of, not only did my internet supposedly get fixed, I upgraded my internet.
[91:15.97]This is $200 a month.
[91:17.11]This is what we get.
[91:18.43]This is the shit you get here for two fucking hundred bucks a month.
[91:23.16]Business class internet from Comcast.
[91:27.18]Un-fucking-believable.
[91:31.37]I've gone through every hoop possible.
[91:41.78]Set the stream to 240.
[91:44.14]It's just dead now.
[91:46.56]Hold on.
[91:46.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[91:47.24]Hold on.
[91:47.47]I've got to text the Comcast guy and say you didn't do it.
[91:49.83]It didn't work.
[91:50.81]Do it again.
[91:51.21]Let me get his number here.
[91:55.79]What is it right here?
[91:58.97]Because he told me to text him the second problems start happening.
[92:02.01]Are we even live still?
[92:04.90]It says zero for me.
[92:13.53]Just wanted to play... This was going to be, like, a long stream, too.
[92:18.86]I was going to play this game for, like, probably at least six hours.
[92:21.48]At least.
[92:23.82]Get the Enterprise Internet.
[92:24.78]The Enterprise Internet is probably, like, $2,000 or $3,000 a month.
[92:27.92]So I can't do that.
[92:33.57]Give me one second.
[92:34.73]I'm going to take, like, a quick break and, like... Like, smash a couple of pots and pans together for, like, two minutes.
[92:41.27]And then I got to text this guy.
[92:43.79]So, it just... Do we, like, drop... I think it's dead?
[92:47.63]No?
[92:51.48]Give me a minute.
[92:52.00]I'm going to see if I can ride it out.
[92:53.58]I'm going to go grab my iPhone charger and shit.
[92:55.82]I'll be right back.
[92:56.92]Sorry about this.
[92:59.02]This was not supposed to be happening anymore.
[93:03.00]See you in a minute.
[95:32.45]I wish there was something I could do.
[95:34.85]But even like the hockey puck thing.
[95:36.65]Yeah, I'm going to go get a hockey puck.
[95:38.59]That wouldn't even work either.
[95:53.30]Just gonna sit here for a minute.
[95:54.58]No, it's not coming back.
[95:57.24]I am in bright red territory right now.
[96:04.09]We were just getting started too, not even two hours.
[96:06.31]Oh, this is so fucking frustrating.
[96:14.25]It's like right when I think, right when I think it's over, it's like, nope.
[96:19.00]Can't wait to be done with this forever.
[96:27.54]Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[96:29.46]I'm really sorry.
[96:30.06]We're going to have to try again tomorrow.
[96:37.65]Hockey puck?
[96:38.37]I don't know if anyone can even hear me.
[96:41.75]A hockey puck.
[96:42.79]Why won't the hotspot work?
[96:43.71]Because I don't even have 4G in this area.
[96:47.60]I can't even do it.
[96:48.14]I can't use it.
[96:49.82]I barely get 3G here.
[96:52.92]Long story short, I'm in like the worst possible fucking location for anything.
[96:59.56]And like I really shouldn't be.
[97:00.92]But this fucking area here, this area right here, is dog shit.
[97:07.83]Like just trash.
[97:09.95]So... If y'all can still hear me, I'm sorry.
[97:19.13]Reducing bitrate is not going to do anything.
[97:20.58]It's zero.
[97:21.86]It's going... It's at zero for like 10 straight seconds.
[97:25.88]And then goes to like... 1100.
