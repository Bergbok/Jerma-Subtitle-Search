[00:02.88]It's not Germercraft unless you have something crazy happen.
[00:05.20]So I'm going to go fight this asshole over here.
[00:07.04]Look at this cow.
[00:10.34]I didn't have a sword.
[00:13.04]This is going to be interesting.
[00:15.62]I should have just made one.
[00:16.72]I should have just made a sword.
[00:17.98]What am I doing?
[00:19.14]Why am I doing this?
[00:20.52]Why am I going after this guy right now?
[00:23.22]What is the matter with me?
[00:25.61]You see, my brain does not work in ways that you would think it should.
[00:29.35]I'm definitely going to die.
[00:30.95]This is the stupidest idea ever.
[00:33.03]That was the dumbest thing I've ever done in this game.
[00:37.50]I don't even have a spawn point.
[00:38.72]Oh, great.
[00:39.28]At least there's cows.
[00:42.72]Mountain cows.
[00:46.32]Whoa.
[00:47.32]Where's my diving board?
[00:49.14]Where's my diving board?
[00:50.96]I made a diving board.
[00:51.86]Where is it?
[00:52.62]Oh!
[00:54.76]Cole!
[00:55.22]There's Cole right there.
[00:56.14]There's Cole right there.
[00:57.94]Get away from me.
[00:59.04]Get away from me.
[01:00.38]Oh, there's three creepers?
[01:01.53]What are you kidding me?
[01:02.41]This is insane!
[01:04.71]What the hell?
[01:06.95]Come on, now.
[01:08.61]Notch.
[01:11.79]You can't get up here.
[01:13.95]You know what?
[01:14.23]Blow up.
[01:14.99]I dare you.
[01:15.99]I dare you.
[01:16.89]Good.
[01:17.27]I'm right next to you.
[01:17.85]Blow up.
[01:20.73]Get out of here.
[01:22.50]Get the hell away from me.
[01:24.70]Everybody just blow up right now.
[01:25.88]Go!
[01:26.32]Blow up!
[01:29.92]I want to see the hole that made.
[01:31.80]Oh, there's my diving board.
[01:33.10]All right.
[01:34.74]Now to... That actually looks kind of cool.
[01:38.68]Did I make it?
[01:39.28]I made it.
[01:41.32]Wait a second.
[01:41.82]How did this happen?
[01:43.66]They're all here, too?
[01:44.60]There's like ten people down here.
[01:48.04]What is... Oh, my God.
[01:50.64]Oh, hey, more people.
[01:51.98]Might as well just run off the cliff.
[01:57.60]Okay, so I've successfully made a hole in my basement where I'm hiding from all the things that have been just killing me over and over again.
[02:07.46]And I'm surrounded right now by mobs.
[02:11.10]Oh my god.
[02:15.20]Can you hear them all?
[02:16.50]They're all over the water.
[02:17.58]I feel like I'm in a Stephen King movie.
[02:21.97]Shouldn't they be dying right now?
[02:24.38]Am I missing?
[02:24.92]Look at all the arrows.
[02:27.76]My house is riddled with arrows.
[02:30.97]Oh my god.
[02:34.23]It looks like this is part of the Lord of the Rings set.
[02:39.55]Why are they not dying?
[02:40.49]It's bright as hell out.
[02:43.73]There we go.
[02:45.77]Now they're on fire.
[02:48.35]Or are they?
[02:49.23]They should be.
[02:53.04]Oh, look at that.
[02:53.62]Oh, look at this.
[02:55.82]Oh, what happened?
[02:57.76]What happened?
[02:58.80]Did you die?
[02:59.48]Why is that guy still alive?
[03:03.00]I'm not going to question that.
[03:05.24]Whatever.
[03:06.91]Okay, now let me rethink what I'm doing here.
[03:10.83]Okay, I've got to collect some of this because I'm an idiot and I died.
[03:14.77]Just going to get a pickaxe, go down there, get some coal, and I should be good to go.
[03:23.54]There we are.
[03:26.62]So while I have the delight, I need to do this.
[03:33.04]Wait, where's my original crafting table?
[03:34.92]What the hell happened to my crafting table?
[03:38.06]Whatever.
[03:39.44]Whatever!
[03:43.43]Yeah, I'm crazy if I think, oh, I'm going to have a castle built.
[03:46.81]I'm going to have a nice castle built by Christmas time.
[03:49.93]Yeah, right.
[03:51.13]Ow.
[03:52.29]All right.
[03:53.04]Let's find some of this.
[03:53.90]There's definitely going to be coal down here.
[03:55.34]I know for a fact there is.
[03:57.36]They wouldn't have this much crap everywhere without coal being right there.
[04:02.79]At least I can get some tools.
[04:03.77]Different tools.
[04:07.13]Listen to that music.
[04:08.99]More caves.
[04:13.05]That's just fantastic.
[04:16.65]Alright.
[04:17.02]No coal yet.
[04:19.78]There's coal right there.
[04:20.82]Found it.
[04:22.33]I got a bunch of butt heads to deal with.
[04:24.27]I feel like I'm playing the drums.
[04:30.98]There it is.
[04:35.94]There's the coal.
[04:37.74]That's what I'm looking for.
[04:39.79]Will you die already?
[04:40.91]Give me a break.
[04:42.83]Alright, here it is.
[04:47.33]Just need one piece of freaking coal.
[04:50.95]For the love of all that is sacred in planet Earth, just give me the coal.
[04:58.35]Oh my god, finally.
[05:02.15]Alright, get me the hell back up so I can start to actually play this game.
[05:08.23]I'm just using my walls.
[05:10.75]Oh yeah, that's fine.
[05:13.96]I'm just going to tear down my own walls to get wood.
[05:19.44]And it's this, right?
[05:20.44]Yeah.
[05:22.39]Success.
[05:23.11]Okay, great.
[05:27.07]So now, let's do this.
[05:31.59]Let's make a little small house so I don't get mutilated when it becomes nighttime.
[05:40.84]That's good enough.
[05:43.14]I just need a bed.
[05:43.86]Actually, no, it needs to be higher than that.
[05:46.54]Oh god, it needs to be at least one block higher than that.
[05:51.72]This is temporary.
[05:52.72]This is temporary.
[05:53.42]I promise.
[05:53.82]This is temporary.
[05:55.16]Piece of sand.
[05:57.38]Look at this mess.
[06:00.42]This is the worst house I've ever seen in Minecraft.
[06:04.40]Ever.
[06:07.42]Alright.
[06:08.60]At least I have some light in my own house.
[06:12.08]Gotta pay the electric bill.
[06:17.06]Well, there's more coal over here.
[06:19.38]That's definitely a start.
[06:21.90]That's definitely a good thing.
[06:24.44]Pick that up.
[06:25.73]Definitely.
[06:28.13]I came over here for that tree right there.
[06:32.01]But I need this coal, too.
[06:34.59]The fun part about Minecraft is you can kind of just get distracted and just go do whatever you feel like for however long you're doing it.
[06:43.02]That's good.
[06:43.48]There's a little more over here I saw.
[06:45.34]Get out of the way.
[06:46.88]Where was it?
[06:48.62]Where was it?
[06:49.82]Where was it?
[06:52.41]No, that's a shovel.
[06:53.91]I thought I saw more.
[06:56.97]Oh, well.
[06:59.11]I came over here for this single out-of-place tree.
[07:01.77]A little bit of light.
[07:09.00]Aim up.
[07:10.54]Always cut down the whole tree or else it won't disappear.
[07:14.76]That's what Grandpa told me.
[07:16.18]Because he raged one time.
[07:22.59]The whole tree?
[07:23.11]You gotta cut down the whole goddamn tree, Jeremy.
[07:27.99]And I said, why?
[07:29.43]Why would I want to do that?
[07:31.38]Because it's against the law if you don't.
[07:33.44]Yeah, it's against the law?
[07:36.50]I don't think so, Grandpa.
[07:39.62]I think you're just nuts.
[07:42.24]Starting to get dark.
[07:46.45]This is a big damn... This is a big tree.
[07:48.43]This has so much wood in it.
[07:51.07]It's got a lot of wood in this tree.
[07:55.05]That's actually a good thing because I don't want to come back and do it again.
[07:58.61]I've got to get up higher.
[08:00.95]Hello, excuse me.
[08:04.92]No, I hate when this happens.
[08:06.28]Now I've got to like... Let me get all up in this tree.
[08:10.60]Can I put a... No, I can't put a torch down right there.
[08:15.14]There's so much wood in this tree.
[08:17.12]It's unbelievable how much wood is in this tree.
[08:19.44]Is that it?
[08:19.86]Oh my god.
[08:22.86]There's more wood in this tree.
[08:25.42]This is insane.
[08:28.12]This entire tree is just a big, huge block of wood.
[08:31.77]Usually there's only a few.
[08:33.57]I'm confused.
[08:35.23]Oh my god.
[08:40.79]Whatever.
[08:41.43]Here's the last one right here.
[08:42.89]I'm out of here.
[08:46.52]Give me the torch.
[08:47.40]I'm going back home.
[08:50.02]Look at that beautiful moon.
[08:52.34]So elegant.
[08:55.85]Okay, so I got that wood.
[08:57.25]Let's do something with it.
[08:59.75]Let's make it into a bunch of things.
[09:04.89]Just shift-click.
[09:06.71]Alright, let's make this into a ton of sticks.
[09:10.23]Shift-click.
[09:12.76]And where's my crafting bench?
[09:14.10]It's down there.
[09:16.58]Alright.
[09:17.72]Let's at least cover this hole up so I can not get murdered if somebody comes and gets me.
[09:23.43]I have my house made out of, like, three different materials right now.
[09:28.62]I'll tell you what, it will make progress.
[09:31.72]If you are watching this video for the first time, and there's like 15 episodes ahead of this, I promise this is not going to be this much of a mess through the whole series.
[09:41.33]Promise.
[09:42.87]And if it is, then... Whoops.
[09:48.49]This will be my nice little cave house for the time being.
[09:54.40]This is it right here.
[09:57.26]Where is my... There we go.
[10:00.22]Let's just close it up.
[10:02.52]No sense in just sitting here like this.
[10:07.13]Here we go.
[10:08.53]My house is pretty much complete.
[10:12.09]At least my caveman house is.
[10:15.95]Let's get in there.
[10:17.87]Oh my god.
[10:18.55]Where's my certificate?
[10:20.15]Where's my certificate for first house built?
[10:22.01]Because it just happened.
[10:25.13]Make it... Oh my god, no!
[10:26.46]No, no!
[10:27.32]No!
[10:30.99]Oh, that could have been bad.
[10:32.05]Imagine if I just drowned myself.
[10:34.08]That would be terrible.
