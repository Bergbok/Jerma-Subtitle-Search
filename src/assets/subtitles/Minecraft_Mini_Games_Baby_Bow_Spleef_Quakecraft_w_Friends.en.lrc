[00:05.12]People are just spawning in here like crazy.
[00:08.28]Yep.
[00:09.36]Oh my gosh, there's so many people in here.
[00:11.39]Let me see if I can find you guys.
[00:12.65]Oh my.
[00:17.03]I feel like somebody just opened up a server for the first time and just told the White House to shout it out.
[00:23.19]There's thousands of people on these servers.
[00:32.43]I feel like I'm at a... I feel like I'm at a costume party.
[00:39.38]Like, oh, look, it's Batman.
[00:40.58]Oh, it's like a sexy nurse.
[00:42.36]Is this a Halloween server?
[00:44.20]This is what I feel like we're playing right now.
[00:45.87]I see Link.
[00:46.35]I see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
[00:48.01]I see a Spider-Man.
[00:49.03]I'm Deadpool right now.
[00:50.47]Yeah, this is like the biggest costume party we've ever been to.
[00:54.38]Jerma, where are you?
[00:55.65]I see you.
[00:56.91]You, like, bearded king thing.
[00:59.69]Oh, there he is.
[01:00.37]He's Jimbo.
[01:04.71]I remember when we made that for you.
[01:07.42]It's so dumb.
[01:11.58]There's a lot of people here, man.
[01:15.21]This is going to be complete chaos.
[01:16.53]There's like going to be 24 people doing this.
[01:18.35]This is going to be awesome!
[01:21.05]We're going to insta-die.
[01:23.11]I don't think this is going to happen.
[01:24.47]I might as well just shoot my feet right when the game starts, because... Oh!
[01:28.36]Here it goes!
[01:29.52]What?
[01:30.84]What?
[01:31.00]No, we got 15 seconds to spread out.
[01:32.48]Those are spreading out!
[01:34.68]You do not get a bow.
[01:35.86]You don't get a bow?
[01:39.62]I don't know.
[01:40.40]It looks like you're supposed to get hit.
[01:41.40]Alright, starting in one second.
[01:42.87]Oh, you do get a bow!
[01:44.61]You get a bow!
[01:45.53]I just shot that guy in the face.
[01:47.77]I think it's going to be... This guy, get away from me, dude.
[01:53.22]Oh, jeez.
[01:54.38]I'm just sprinting around.
[01:56.34]Oh, get dropped.
[01:57.62]Get elevated.
[01:59.22]Hello?
[02:01.02]Is my game still a different color?
[02:04.87]Is my name still a different color?
[02:05.93]Because I think people are like, it's targeting me.
[02:07.56]Okay.
[02:07.96]Oh, it's good.
[02:10.31]I'm doing what italics is doing.
[02:12.99]I'm looking at the ground, I'm looking at the ground.
[02:16.78]I almost just killed myself.
[02:18.52]Oh, I almost killed myself.
[02:20.40]No, Moon, please!
[02:21.96]Come here!
[02:23.18]Oh no!

[02:53.28]I wanna kill Jerma.
[02:54.74]You can.
[02:55.64]Trust me.

[04:25.78]Oh, I just fell down!
[04:29.07]Lookit, this guy didn't even need to do anything, he's just walking around in a circle.

[04:37.23]Oh, Teoga goes in with the first blood.
[04:41.53]Peanutpwn.
[04:43.13]Oh, Dalek!
[04:44.66]Where were you?
[04:45.60]I was on the rafters.
[04:47.82]Oh, this guy spawned camping the stairs!
[04:51.10]Oh my god.
[04:53.96]Where the hell were you?
[04:56.58]Right behind you.
[04:57.62]Ah, there's explosives all around me.
[04:59.20]Little snake.
[05:02.39]Oh, baby.
[05:03.53]No, don't kill me, please.
[05:04.51]I don't think so, stealth.
[05:06.29]Snipes at me from across the map.
[05:08.89]God, I feel like I'm playing like direct hit soldier right now.
[05:12.11]Oh, Tio, if I had killed you from that shot, oh my goodness.
[05:15.31]The 360!
[05:15.91]Get me out of there.
[05:18.56]Oh, hi, Tio!
[05:20.92]No, I spawn kill you from my spawn.
[05:24.18]The reverse spawn kill.
[05:25.84]The reverse spawn kill.
[05:27.40]I always feel like somebody's behind me.
[05:30.20]Oh, hi.
[05:30.98]Check my back.
[05:32.49]God damn it!
[05:34.05]This music doesn't fit at all, by the way.
[05:36.41]I always have music turned off.
[05:38.57]It's like... It's like the most peaceful music.
[05:44.49]Hold on a second.
[05:45.13]I gotta turn this up.
[05:47.67]Turn it up.
[05:48.38]It doesn't fit at all.
[05:51.34]This is pretty good, like, let's kill each other music.
[05:53.34]I didn't feel like chasing you around the lamp.
[05:55.78]I didn't feel like chasing you.
[05:57.58]Yes, my revenge.
[05:59.00]I didn't kill you with that?
[06:00.92]God!
[06:02.08]I just heard you like upset like in complaint and I was like right clicked right I was like I probably shouldn't and I did
[06:25.96]I don't know why, but I always jump off something at the very tip top for fun.
[06:30.24]I'd be a horrible tactician.
[06:33.85]And we jump off!
[06:35.91]I run to the top as fast as I can and just make a leap off the top to see if I can get a kill.
[06:40.81]I honestly just can't believe that you can do this without installing any mods.
[06:45.69]Yeah, it's completely mod-free on the user end.
[06:48.71]Where is everybody?
[06:49.41]What's going on here?
[06:51.86]I got teleported to, like, a different part of the map where no enemies were.
[06:56.48]Except for me.
[06:57.14]Oh, okay.
[06:58.38]Here we go.
[06:59.56]All right.
[07:00.40]All right, fine.
[07:00.80]You stood still.
[07:01.78]I thought I got you.
[07:05.44]No, you... I saw you pick your little cactus head up over the blocks.
[07:09.92]Yeah, I got you.
[07:11.26]I got you.
[07:13.24]I gotta stop, like, looking over that edge.
[07:14.58]It's like the death of me.
[07:16.54]Oh my god, I am gonna freak out.
[07:18.88]Oh, hey!
[07:20.47]Jerma and Tio, the last two people I killed, returned to their crime scenes.
[07:24.99]Oh, shit.
[07:26.33]No!
[07:28.49]Alright, I'm not dying again.
[07:29.85]I'm not dying, like, five times in a row.
[07:31.74]I'm gonna go on a spree.
[07:32.96]Yeah, that's what's going on for me as well.
[07:35.04]That's my plan also.
[07:36.46]Hey, we're making like a little choo-choo train here.
[07:38.52]I'm going down in like the Spider Kingdom.
[07:48.34]If you want to meet me down in the Spider Kingdom, you're welcome to come try.
[07:52.33]Where is the Spider Kingdom?
[07:53.65]Oh, you don't know where the Spider Kingdom is?
[07:56.25]Oh ho ho ho ho!
[07:57.19]Spider Kingdom!
[07:57.89]I knew it!
[07:59.19]Oh, hello!
[08:01.73]Tio!
[08:02.09]Why are you there?
[08:03.73]I run the Spider Kingdom.
[08:06.20]Well, never mind.
[08:07.22]I have seven points.
[08:08.04]Take that, Teo!
[08:09.06]For me.
[08:11.14]Career.
[08:11.48]Career.
[08:13.56]Are you trying to tell me that that didn't... Okay.
[08:15.96]I was gonna say.
[08:16.74]I was about to flip out.
[08:17.56]Jump the 360!
[08:18.96]Oh!
[08:19.20]Got me!
[08:20.48]Oh!
[08:21.10]And Teo gets... That was a long shot.
[08:23.66]...the kill shot of the game!
[08:24.72]Trela!
[08:27.56]I was about to kill that guy.
[08:28.56]I know.
[08:30.15]Italics!
[08:31.23]Oh!
[08:31.47]I missed twice and you still got me!
[08:34.19]Who killed me from behind?
[08:35.35]Oh, it was... I don't even know who the hell hit me from behind.
[08:38.63]Meh.
[08:41.50]Oh.
[08:41.84]Oh, stealthies.
[08:42.54]One more point.
[08:43.40]One more point and he wins the golden cup.
[08:47.20]Oh, wow.
[08:47.68]Italics, get down from there, you kid.
[08:49.36]Oh, baby.
[08:51.38]Come back.
[08:52.21]Come back.
[08:52.77]Come back.
[08:54.59]Awww.
[08:56.52]Somebody show me your body!
[08:57.54]Catalics can't win.
[09:00.28]Ah!
[09:00.54]Beautiful!
[09:02.32]I see one more!
[09:05.38]No!
[09:05.88]Yeah!
[09:06.82]Dammit!
[09:07.31]Thank you, Gemma!
[09:09.53]From the top turnbuckle.
