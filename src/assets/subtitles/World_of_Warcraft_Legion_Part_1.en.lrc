[ve:60.16.100]

[01:26.25]Well, hello there.
[01:27.39]Good afternoon.
[01:28.19]Good evening.
[01:33.23]So, tonight, not scheduled to stream today, but I'm adding Monday.
[01:41.35]Monday is being added, at least temporarily for a while.
[01:45.45]It's not scheduled, but I was under the impression that today, well, actually, I'll wait.
[01:51.21]I'm going to wait until people get here.
[01:54.94]Because I need to explain this every stream.
[01:57.08]I have to explain this fucking dumb internet problem because Comcast doesn't want to fix the problem.
[02:02.62]They don't ever want to, you know, they don't want to fix it.
[02:06.43]I keep getting led along with a carrot on a stick.
[02:14.21]So we're just going to chill.
[02:15.95]This stream is going to go down because they didn't fix it.
[02:21.89]The starting screen should be the JermaSolar system.
[02:25.53]That's actually a great idea.
[02:30.17]That's a great idea.
[02:31.37]The whole solar system just spinning around.
[02:34.71]Spinning around the moon, by the way.
[02:37.55]The moon is the center of the universe.
[02:39.38]It's where the sun should be, but it's bigger than the sun.
[02:42.90]The sun is revolving around the German moon.
[02:46.42]That's a good idea.
[02:47.44]I like that.
[02:52.14]I like that.
[02:56.92]Oh, let me close my window.
[02:58.42]Hey, hey.
[03:02.06]Happy birthday, Gage.
[03:04.22]Hope you have a swell one.
[03:05.11]Hope you get cake and ice cream and hope you stuff your face with it.
[03:09.85]One second.
[03:14.45]Oh, boy.
[03:20.14]make it animated like three FPS to reflect the stream lately.
[03:25.64]Uh, it sucks, dude.
[03:28.26]Hey, thank you.
[03:28.70]Frozen crazy tuna for eight months.
[03:32.03]I don't have a CLR browser connected at the moment, but thank you nonetheless.
[03:37.49]And then thank you to Naya Romey for seven months.
[03:42.24]Welcome back guys.
[03:44.86]So tonight we're just going to play.
[03:46.44]Wow.
[03:47.20]It's going to be a wow stream tonight.
[03:50.30]It's not something that you're going to see that often, but I realistically.
[03:55.02]So here's the story for people that are trickling in.
[04:00.08]I was told on Thursday by a Comcast business support representative that I was going to get the Internet problem.
[04:07.87]Somebody was going to go check the node and fix it if there was a problem with the node on the street or in the neighborhood within 24 to 48 hours.
[04:15.97]And this is on Thursday, by the way, so I was going to get a call
[04:20.48]Somebody's going to call me on Monday and tell me like, oh, here's an update for you, sir.
[04:26.00]Monday morning, we're going to call you.
[04:27.26]That's what I was told.
[04:28.58]Didn't get a phone call.
[04:30.42]So I called back like two hours ago.
[04:33.12]I said, hey, so what's going on here?
[04:36.43]I was told that Monday I was going to get a call.
[04:37.95]They were supposed to come check out the node.
[04:39.21]It was a technician who was going to come to my street or the neighborhood or something.
[04:42.87]Oh, let me look up your number.
[04:44.49]Let me see your... Let's take a look.
[04:47.25]Okay.
[04:48.70]Yeah, that's not scheduled until tomorrow at 1.
[04:50.70]I'm just like... What the fuck?
[04:56.16]Why was I told on Thursday that Monday I was going to get a call and it was going to get fixed?
[05:01.54]So apparently, they're not fixing the problem or even going to try to until tomorrow afternoon.
[05:07.97]But I was told something completely different.
[05:11.31]So because today was supposed to be the like test the connection stream.
[05:17.71]And that didn't happen.
[05:19.18]Like this, this is just going to be we're going to hang out and just this is going to be the hangout and talk shit about Comcast stream.
[05:25.74]Oh, shit.
[05:26.50]Womp Ronnie.
[05:27.68]11 months.
[05:27.94]You're very close, Ronnie.
[05:30.02]Almost there.
[05:30.78]Thank you, Womp Ronnie.
[05:32.89]Ronnie.
[05:34.23]If you don't know, Ronnie is a swell gentleman.
[05:37.09]He is King Mod currently.
[05:39.47]Actually, there's been some debate as to who the real King Mod is.
[05:43.77]But Ronnie is a really great guy.
[05:45.97]Follow him everywhere he goes.
[05:47.23]Ronnie, just put all your stuff in the chat.
[05:50.16]You've got a really funny webcomic.
[05:51.70]Check it out.
[05:52.06]It's great.
[05:53.24]And I think he streams sometimes.
[05:54.74]He's a good dude.
[05:57.03]And then Criminy Fist, the rest of your name, I'm kind of scared to say, but thanks for four months, dude.
[06:05.08]Scare Saturday's Revival.
[06:06.38]I will play a scary game.
[06:09.32]I'm going to play a scary game this month.
[06:11.94]I just don't know which month it's going to be.
[06:18.33]And then Ketapugon, Ketapidgin.
[06:20.51]Ketapidgin, Ketapidgin.
[06:22.07]That's what I'm going to call you.
[06:23.29]Thanks for eight months, dude.
[06:26.93]But yeah, I'm going to just switch over to WoW.
[06:29.79]You can see where I currently am right now.
[06:33.77]I'm in the Mage Hall.
[06:36.69]This is my main character.
[06:38.07]If my main character was taken over, it's no longer Electric Man.
[06:42.79]Thanks, Twisted Lobster.
[06:44.69]No longer Electric Man, it's now Jocko, the Arcane Mage.
[06:49.23]What?
[06:50.87]It's not Electric Man anymore?
[06:53.65]No, I love Arcane.
[06:54.63]Arcane, I fell in love with it.
[06:57.59]What's my eye level?
[06:58.49]I'll show you in a second.
[06:59.15]I'll show you guys all my stats, all my, like, shitty stats.
[07:03.25]I just love playing Arcade Mage because you can just do this.
[07:07.06]Oh, yeah.
[07:07.78]Arcade Missiles.
[07:09.52]Arcade Missiles is, like, the funnest move in the whole game.
[07:14.34]It's really fun.
[07:16.72]But, yeah, we're just going to play this.
[07:17.86]I think Italics is going to join us soon at some point.
[07:21.05]He was fixing some stuff on his computer.
[07:23.63]He's going to hang out with us.
[07:25.83]Rewind to Electric Man.
[07:30.23]Arcane.
[07:31.23]Yeah, I like to play Arcane.
[07:32.81]Because fire, I don't know.
[07:33.53]If it fires to everybody's fire.
[07:38.24]Every single person in World of Warcraft that's a mage.
[07:40.38]Like 98% of them are fire mages.
[07:44.24]Every time I see another Arcane mage, I'll just bow to them and wave to them and shit.
[07:49.42]Because, you know, you never see them.
[07:51.58]Same with Frost too.
[07:55.43]Arcane Missiles is trash?
[07:56.63]What?
[07:58.37]Well, not since this.
[08:01.37]Take a look at that.
[08:03.95]There's a 33% chance every time you fire Arcane Missiles that you fire three more.
[08:08.22]So you can fire eight.
[08:09.82]So you can do that.
[08:10.54]That happens all the time.
[08:11.64]It's great.
[08:12.70]Hipster Mage?
[08:14.18]No, I'm always interested in Arcane.
[08:16.24]Plus, the weapon talks to you.
[08:22.25]But hello.
[08:23.67]Welcome to the stream.
[08:24.51]Welcome to my... I'm just going to sit here and wait until my internet goes down because it's going to happen again.
[08:28.19]I didn't want to make a big deal about this stream today because I didn't want to start a new game or... Hey, let's do this.
[08:34.30]Let's do that.
[08:35.18]Me and Italics were thinking about playing a new game or starting something new.
[08:39.64]And... It was just... Eh.
[08:44.06]I didn't want to have to start something new and it potentially going down within an hour or two.
[08:49.47]Where's the Egg Mage?
[08:50.31]Well, look at my transmog.
[08:52.15]I'm like the bubblegum mage.
[08:53.47]Come on.
[08:54.35]I don't have the whole thing though.
[08:56.65]Here's the whole thing.
[08:59.22]I want the whole dumb thing.
[09:01.34]Where is it?
[09:01.72]Let's see.
[09:06.36]Where's the chest?
[09:09.25]See?
[09:10.53]How cool is this?
[09:11.57]How cool is it going to be to finally be the fucking cotton candy mage?
[09:15.97]It's so ugly.
[09:16.81]I love it.
[09:18.85]You can see me from a mile away.
[09:20.29]You can pick me out of a crowd if you need to find me.
[09:28.30]Your belt game is weak.
[09:29.80]It's going to get replaced.
[09:31.60]I don't have it all yet.
[09:33.26]See?
[09:35.08]Your belt game is weak.
[09:36.57]Yeah, we're just going to play a while.
[09:43.21]So let's go.
[09:43.75]I have some world quests to do.
[09:47.01]Let's see what they are today.
[09:48.31]I haven't done it today.
[09:49.31]It's the court.
[09:51.23]So it's for quests in Azura.
[09:52.99]So this is what somebody was asking me.
[09:55.05]They were like, what the hell is this?
[09:56.43]What's going on here?
[09:57.35]Why is World of Warcraft Legion a great game?
[10:01.58]Well, it's because they added this.
[10:03.92]World quests have made World of Warcraft interesting to play every day.
[10:08.19]Because you get a certain emissary, right, to do.
[10:13.49]Don't be making fun of me because I'm playing Alliance.
[10:16.23]Come on, for the Alliance.
[10:17.75]I wouldn't be able to have a Jocko.
[10:21.57]This guy wouldn't be able to exist on the Horde.
[10:25.82]But anyways, you do a series of four missions, doesn't matter where they are, as long as they're in the same zone as the emissary.
[10:34.36]So, for instance, these change every day.
[10:37.68]So sometimes it'll be over here.
[10:39.14]There'll be something to do down here and the quest rewards can be pretty good.
[10:43.70]For instance, this is, I have to just do this and I get this item and it could roll up to a higher eye level.
[10:51.09]This is NA.
[10:54.49]Do arena with viewers.
[10:55.49]I actually was thinking about potentially doing like just a random mythic or something with subs or something at some point.
[11:04.82]Let's go do those.
[11:05.60]I'm going to show you my arcane mage skills.
[11:08.00]And everyone can make fun of my unoptimized character.
[11:10.56]What's going on?
[11:12.36]Skit skat.
[11:13.26]Thanks for subbing.
[11:14.78]And then Nilithoa for four months.
[11:17.20]Twisted Lobster for six months.
[11:18.46]And Yurk.
[11:19.61]Thank you, Yurk, for subscribing.
[11:20.61]So, we're going to go to Izuno.
[11:23.13]And we're waiting for Italics to come yell at us.
[11:27.69]So, look.
[11:28.21]There's like four things to do right here.
[11:30.11]Pretty much.
[11:30.47]Like one, two, three.
[11:31.23]And I can just go down.
[11:32.15]I can go...
[11:34.22]Oh, is that better?
[11:35.30]Oh, okay, everyone needs to be able to make fun of my character, so let's do this.
[11:39.44]Wait, what?
[11:40.76]There are my stats as my eye level.
[11:42.58]You can, everyone just, everyone make fun of me.
[11:47.73]Make fun of my bad optimization, except that mastery is like the number one stat for arcane.
[11:57.35]You stack mastery so you get more mana so you don't run out of mana.
[12:02.28]852.
[12:03.66]Not at 880 eye level.
[12:05.70]I don't have a plan to be.
[12:08.48]What's going on, Black Eagle?
[12:09.44]Thank you for your seven months.
[12:13.14]What a scrub.
[12:14.54]Dude, I don't do mythic plus 10.
[12:22.32]No legendary.
[12:23.16]Yeah, I'm like the only person in our group of friends that doesn't have a legendary.
[12:29.08]So let's teleport to Izuna.
[12:31.12]And then immediately get on the flight path.
[12:34.90]Delete your account.
[12:45.67]No Mythic plus 10 gear.
[12:52.05]The highest I think I've done is Mythic plus 5, I think.
[12:59.08]I cannot believe that my favorite streamer is this much of a scrub.
[13:05.66]I do fine DPS though.
[13:06.96]If you consider fine DPS being like... 230 to 250?
[13:12.10]Something like that?
[13:15.38]That's why I have the meter here.
[13:16.59]You can see the meter.
[13:17.41]Look at that.
[13:17.71]Like 103k be DPS.
[13:21.15]You wanna see some DPS?
[13:22.75]Fine.
[13:23.67]Check this out.
[13:26.29]Two.
[13:28.29]Three.
[13:30.65]Four DPS!
[13:31.57]You just saw that.
[13:32.09]I just did four DPSs right there.
[13:34.83]Take a look at my 88k right now.
[13:37.95]Because Arcane sucks for the first, like, five minutes.
[13:44.53]That's an Arcane Mage.
[13:45.37]Look it.
[13:45.71]That's an Arcane Mage, too.
[13:50.89]Now, if you don't know how Arcane works... I'll explain it in a second here.
[13:56.60]So, Arcane.
[13:57.56]Oh, Italics is coming.
[13:58.42]That means Italics is coming.
[13:59.74]See these right here?
[14:00.46]These four charges?
[14:02.30]If you don't have four of these, your character is worthless.
[14:06.71]Like, if I don't have all four of these built up, you have to cast moves to get these to fill up.
[14:11.29]My DPS is terrible.
[14:12.31]And not about DPS.
[14:14.23]What's going on with my framerate?
[14:17.05]My framerate, like, sucks right now.
[14:18.89]Hold on.
[14:22.35]What is going on with this, like, shitty FPS?
[14:27.96]graphics quality 10 when did that happen that I did not do that I can't like my computer like sucks I can't do that but so for instance wise you check this out so now now I actually can like do damage to things like that thing's just gonna die like right now check this out dead 230 fucking thousand DPS you see that 234 K unbelievable
[15:02.25]What the hell is this?
[15:02.87]Ooh, Felwort.
[15:03.61]Let's plant it here.
[15:06.20]Let's water the Felwort.
[15:07.18]Alright, so I need to go... I'll just go right here.
[15:10.97]This is the most boring part of the whole game, is collecting Ley Lines.
[15:18.76]Good 480p.
[15:23.04]Oh, you wanna see my talents, too?
[15:24.92]Alright, here are the talents.
[15:26.24]Don't make fun of these talents, and I'll tell you the reason why I have them.
[15:28.51]So, Rune of Power is supposed to be like, you're supposed to take it.
[15:30.51]It's so much better than both of these.
[15:32.47]But fuck standing still.
[15:33.45]I'm not standing still.
[15:35.45]I'm not gonna stand fucking still in this dumb thing.
[15:38.49]It can't just flow way better.
[15:39.63]You can move around.
[15:40.19]You don't have to sit and, like, read a newspaper.
[15:42.40]Like that thing I saw on the Reddit.
[15:45.51]Everyone says to take shimmer or cauterize.
[15:47.19]No, you take cold snap.
[15:48.37]You get two of these.
[15:50.19]Two ice blocks.
[15:51.13]Saves your life.
[15:51.69]Heals you.
[15:53.18]Come on.
[15:57.28]Let's pick up this aetheral.
[16:00.32]Oh, what's going on with your ting rate?
[16:01.58]I know, I got such a shitty ting rate.
[16:06.18]You said you'd never go back to WoW?
[16:08.06]I did say that.
[16:09.08]But that was also back in a time when WoW was an awful game.
[16:13.06]It was not a fun game.
[16:14.00]It was terrible.
[16:17.66]He's as bronze Drake as his flying mount.
[16:19.62]Oh, yeah?
[16:21.14]I bet you don't even have the zebra.
[16:23.94]Hmm.
[16:25.62]Bet you don't have the zebra.
[16:27.34]Make fun of my bronze Drake all you want.
[16:29.01]You don't have the zebra.
[16:31.85]I do.
[16:32.65]I got the zebra.
[16:37.09]Yeah, I'm gonna go get that Felwort.
[16:38.47]I'm gonna do this and go back and get it.
[16:39.55]Uh, hello.
[16:47.20]There we go.
[16:57.43]What's my Zevra's name?
[16:58.99]Bill.
[17:01.95]Zevra Bill.
[17:08.30]I don't have a Snattercat mount, you're right.
[17:12.90]What's going on, guys?
[17:15.83]Springfield250, sort of steamy.
[17:17.97]Thanks for your subscriptions.
[17:20.99]And Johnny Car- Johnny Crabbit.
[17:23.51]Carol Crabbit.
[17:25.16]Thanks for the sub.
[17:26.56]Resubbing.
[17:27.62]And then, eugh, subscribed as well.
[17:30.88]Thanks to a lot of you guys.
[17:36.85]Yeah, I'm just doing- I'm gonna get these out of the way and then probably do, like, a mythic or something.
[17:41.87]If anybody- If any of you guys that are subs that want to play, that have, uh- I'm getting stuck.
[17:47.49]If you guys have at least like an 835 eye level, oh man, then maybe you could play.
[17:53.19]I am eating chicken right now.
[18:01.57]Thank you, Turtle Man.
[18:02.22]Welcome.
[18:10.54]Snaticat attacked me while I was on my way to 7-Eleven.
[18:14.44]Did you zap him?
[18:15.40]I hope you zapped him.
[18:22.54]Come on, you have to have at least like an 840 eye level, man.
[18:26.88]And then you're gonna get to see Jocko's real DPS when we do like a dungeon.
[18:42.86]Look at this exciting gameplay.
[18:48.18]Are you guys getting excited right now?
[18:50.14]I'm collecting the ley lines.
[18:51.16]This is the absolute most boring thing you'll see.
[18:54.08]This is running through the ley lines.
[19:02.89]For people that don't know what WoW is and don't play the game, this looks really dumb.
[19:07.54]I don't understand.
[19:09.08]He's riding around through like blue glowing shit on a mount.
[19:12.87]What is this game?
[19:13.95]This game sucks.
[19:18.21]No, this is just a dumb world quest that you have to do.
[19:22.67]Oh yeah, like I'm defeating the Legion.
[19:24.73]I'm making my way across the Legion right now.
[19:27.19]Alright, this is one done.
[19:34.66]And then, of course, what you have to do is like the guy that say, oh, look at this.
[19:37.04]Oh, whoa.
[19:37.64]Mage, huh?
[19:38.82]Huh.
[19:39.36]Hmm.
[19:40.04]What mage is this?
[19:40.76]What kind of mage is this?
[19:42.68]Not an arcane mage.
[19:44.28]That's a kill on sight.
[19:48.91]Just give me a minute.
[19:50.91]Give me a few minutes.
[19:55.27]Oh, what's that?
[19:56.57]Ice block.
[20:03.55]Where'd she go?
[20:04.43]Oh, you want to go invisible?
[20:05.73]I can do that shit too.
[20:06.47]Except mine's much better than yours.
[20:09.51]I have greater invisibility.
[20:15.81]Where'd she go?
[20:18.69]Where are you?
[20:26.30]She ran away.
[20:27.64]Too scared.
[20:28.08]Yeah, I'd be scared too.
[20:30.86]If you're going to get to the arcane mage.
[20:35.54]I am not a clicker.
[20:36.62]I have... Look.
[20:37.62]Look.
[20:38.46]Everything is bound to keys.
[20:40.60]Except for like two moves.
[20:42.50]See?
[20:42.72]You see me click?
[20:43.78]Have I clicked?
[20:46.48]See?
[20:47.16]Just... I'm not a clicker.
[20:48.68]I only click like two moves.
[20:49.96]These ones.
[20:50.40]Because I don't have enough key bindings.
[20:52.40]Don't ever call me a clicker.
[20:53.42]Is that a click?
[20:54.36]Did I click right there?
[20:55.72]No, I didn't.
[20:57.16]Don't ever call me a clicker ever again.
[21:07.87]trash clicker.
[21:09.67]I clicked two moves because I ran out of fucking... I ran out of shift, Q, shift, E, shift, mouse button, mouse button, two.
[21:18.58]You want to know why none of these are bound?
[21:20.26]Because I never use them.
[21:21.04]Because I don't have a PvP.
[21:25.48]If I'm in a dungeon where I need to do it, I need to do it once in a while.
[21:28.78]Once every fucking four hours.
[21:31.55]Where's my fel wart?
[21:34.03]Where did I plant that?
[21:39.79]Where did I plant that fell word?
[21:41.03]I forget what I did.
[21:43.44]It was next to a water source, I think.
[21:46.10]Oh, whatever.
[21:46.74]I lost it.
[21:48.16]That's the first time I've ever done that.
[21:49.24]I didn't even know what it did.
[21:53.26]My bank's fraud detection.
[21:57.25]At the lake.
[21:57.75]Okay, yeah.
[21:58.43]This lake, right?
[22:02.79]Click to mount.
[22:03.57]Yeah, of course you're going to click to mount.
[22:06.37]You guys have bound keys to mount?
[22:09.56]No way.
[22:10.14]I don't believe you.
[22:11.60]I do not believe you.
[22:13.36]Clicker.
[22:15.66]Well, I gotta say thank you to these guys making fun of me.
[22:20.47]Where did I put that fucking teleport?
[22:21.95]Are you gonna get mad that I clicked on that?
[22:30.79]Thank you, iManProNation, for your thousand bits, man.
[22:33.17]Much appreciated.
[22:35.55]Control-D to mount.
[22:38.60]Thank you, Supo Fishy for 50 bits.
[22:40.49]Thank you, Abbott J for your 100 bits.

[22:48.57]Rick Bilby for your 100 bits.

[22:53.06]I will show you my achievements.
[22:54.42]StereoSun3 for the subscription.
[22:55.88]Thank you very much, guys.
[22:57.70]And then Turtleman for the sub.
[22:59.06]Welcome, dudes.
[22:59.74]And then welcome Drunk Orson Welles.
[23:05.16]No auto-loot.
[23:06.50]God, come on, guys.
[23:07.40]I'm not, like, a pro raider.
[23:08.58]I play this game... I play this game in my underwear.
[23:13.98]I come home... I come home and I'm, like, shit-faced.
[23:16.70]Like, after, like, a night of drinking and I play WoW for, like, an hour.
[23:19.10]Give me a break.
[23:20.14]Except none of that's true.
[23:23.00]Click to harvest?
[23:25.18]Where did I put that fucking felwort?
[23:27.64]Somebody else, like, probably got it.
[23:30.09]I was too busy, like, planning it and, like, defending myself that I forgot where I put it.
[23:40.78]My click rate is too low.
[23:41.86]Alright, we're going to play hot and cold with the chat.
[23:46.08]You guys remember, it was like over here, right?
[23:49.73]Hot or cold.
[23:57.63]Okay, it was back here.
[23:58.39]Guys, I remember casting moves with that guy.
[24:04.49]Where was it?
[24:07.49]I lost my Felwort because I'm an idiot.
[24:12.38]Hot cold.
[24:15.92]It's like right around here.
[24:18.85]I remember.
[24:19.69]It was like right here somewhere.
[24:24.83]No, that's not it.
[24:25.67]What the fuck?
[24:29.17]I'll get it regardless.
[24:34.15]Click the logout button?
[24:36.82]Oh, wait a second.
[24:37.40]I'm sorry, guys.
[24:37.90]I clicked another move.
[24:44.22]Hey, I'm gonna play WoW the way I wanna play WoW.
[24:46.60]This is the way it's gonna happen.
[24:51.16]I like to click.
[24:52.51]I'm a big clicker.
[25:01.97]Oh my god.
[25:03.31]How was I to know that World of Warcraft was more elitist than, like, Counter-Strike?
[25:08.64]Oh my Jesus.
[25:13.96]Why am I still... I'm not in combat.
[25:15.20]Get me out of combat.
[25:21.80]You can get banned for clicking.
[25:23.13]Alright, honest to God, I think I may have lost this Felwort.
[25:29.29]I was too busy getting stressed and flustered at you guys for making fun of me for being a clicker.
[25:36.79]Yeah, it's gone.
[25:37.15]I don't even care.
[25:38.45]That was the first time.
[25:39.47]I didn't even know what that did.
[25:41.35]I saw the soil.
[25:42.66]I'm going to go watch the VOD.
[25:45.76]I'm going to go watch my VOD right now to see where it is.
[25:48.68]It's definitely not down there.
[26:05.75]Okay, was it the top lake?
[26:08.05]Over here?
[26:08.58]Like, where was it?
[26:09.34]I was, like, up here.
[26:14.70]I'm about to give up on it and, like, give it to somebody else.
[26:16.88]Like, who gives a shit?
[26:19.18]Which one of these lakes was it?
[26:20.26]It was at one of these lakes.
[26:22.46]This up here on the right?
[26:24.10]This one?
[26:28.22]He's a backpedaler.
[26:29.56]He's a bronze drake.
[26:32.34]You don't have a script that plays the game for you?
[26:38.39]You guys are brutal.
[26:39.45]Alright, right up here.
[26:45.15]This is where it was.
[26:51.06]Pray to the dolphin and find out?
[26:52.48]I wonder.
[26:52.84]Maybe I could.
[26:54.62]He clicked to exit the map.
[26:55.94]Where the fuck is it?
[27:02.80]Where is it?
[27:06.31]I kind of don't even give a shit anymore.
[27:08.75]I kind of give up.
[27:12.57]Streamers exist only for people to be mean to.
[27:14.67]Wouldn't it be appearing on my map?
[27:29.93]Take care of clicks to pee.
[27:37.15]Alright, I give up.
[27:39.11]That's the first time I ever had a Felwort seed.
[27:41.17]I didn't even know what it did.
[27:42.27]And I put it in the ground and forgot what I was even doing.
[27:48.58]Just unplugged the mouse.
[27:49.78]Yeah, I'm done.
[27:51.06]I'm fucking out of here.
[27:55.18]You guys are like in my head so bad.
[27:57.35]It's like the worst thing.
[27:59.05]Now I'm thinking about every single time I click the mouse.
[28:06.45]Every time I click the mouse now, I'm just like, shit, they're watching me click the mouse.
[28:19.62]You guys are like, you guys are like up my ass right now.
[28:23.70]That came out wrong.
[28:24.62]You know what I mean?
[28:26.46]I'm just fucking blowing the whistle.
[28:27.80]I clicked it.
[28:35.10]Hold on.
[28:36.20]One of my bindings got screwed up.
[28:41.03]Oh, it's action bar.
[28:41.77]It's 9-0.
[28:42.87]There it is.
[28:48.22]There we go.
[28:49.90]That's better.
[28:53.48]Okay.
[28:54.90]Let's continue.
[29:00.01]I'm going to go to Illidari Stand.
[29:02.78]See?
[29:03.10]I just was gonna click that button.
[29:04.72]I was gonna click it.
[29:05.46]And then I hit M instead.
[29:07.43]I went like this and pressed M. Use the scroll wheel?
[29:14.49]I don't use the scroll wheel.
[29:19.18]Yeah, I bind to mouse clicks.
[29:20.58]I do.
[29:22.38]Mouse click.
[29:23.00]This is a mouse click.
[29:23.78]This is a mouse click.
[29:24.52]This is a mouse click.
[29:26.08]This is a mouse click.
[29:27.14]This is a mouse click.
[29:27.92]That's a mouse click.
[29:31.09]I have multiple buttons on my mouse.
[29:33.23]So yeah, I am a clicker.
[29:35.20]Come on.
[29:35.96]Deal with it.
[29:40.32]No action bar mod.
[29:41.36]No, we played vanilla default.
[29:49.07]Wait, what?
[29:53.39]Does everybody just call me Jon Snow?
[29:57.43]I gotta bring 40 storm skill.
[29:58.74]That ain't happening.
[30:01.23]I'm doing this one.
[30:05.52]You can call me a clicker if you want, but I'm an advanced clicker.
[30:13.11]Thank you, Warvoid, for five months.
[30:16.64]Thank you, ACG Schmuck.
[30:19.30]Thank you, Drunk Horse and Wells.
[30:20.62]You're going to see Flanker in WoW.
[30:23.12]It's possible.
[30:25.08]It is very possible.
[30:26.06]I'm going to be clicking this.
[30:29.78]Click that one.
[30:33.60]Thanks a lot to the new subscriptions.
[30:34.94]Let me make sure I didn't miss anybody.
[30:37.72]Yuveins on Knacknud.
[30:39.84]1, 2, 3.
[30:40.34]Thanks for subbing.
[30:41.27]Hey Zeus for 7 months.
[30:42.29]Thanks a lot, Hey Zeus.
[30:44.59]Thanks to all you guys.
[30:47.00]Alright, so I have two.
[30:48.16]What is this?
[30:51.20]I get an epic for this.
[30:51.92]Hopefully it rolls up.
[30:52.76]It's probably not going to be a better one than I have.
[30:53.96]I have an 860 currently.
[30:57.88]My top two stats are crit and mastery.
[30:59.81]Mastery is more important than crit by a very small amount, so I have a lot of mastery gear on.
[31:06.43]As you can see.
[31:07.21]Okay.
[31:13.45]I don't think I've ever done this one.
[31:17.15]Nearby Nightwatcher.
[31:20.05]Okay.
[31:24.74]Nightwatcher rallied?
[31:26.08]Where the fuck are they?
[31:27.40]Just like sitting around.
[31:29.24]Oh, there's a Nightwatcher.
[31:32.20]One out of ten.
[31:33.36]There's so many horde here, I'm gonna die.
[31:35.18]I'm gonna get fucking just ganked.
[31:39.50]Someone is going to just kill me.
[31:41.20]For free.
[31:44.02]That's the problem when you're on like a super skewed server.
[31:48.53]Was he about to click?
[31:49.73]I was about to click the quest ability.
[31:51.27]How else would you do it?
[31:51.92]Are you going to bind a quest ability?
[31:53.24]Should you show me a... Oh god, Italics wants to join me.
[32:03.72]Italics wants to join me.
[32:04.90]What the hell is going on?
[32:13.01]Where is he?
[32:14.66]is he in the team speak hold on guys wait just one second are you in here yeah I finally figured out all of my computer problems I'm getting made fun of because I click some abilities everyone's calling me a clicker and an idiot and stupid and dumb everyone's making fun of me
[32:41.62]Like, two moves.
[32:42.50]I click on ice barrier.
[32:46.47]And, like, that's it.
[32:50.31]I mean, I've made fun of you, too.
[32:51.54]So, I don't know if you're trying to find, like, a defender here.
[32:54.16]No, but I have, like, 15 bound keys.
[32:56.84]And people are like, you're a clicker.
[32:58.00]I'm like, I'm not a clicker.
[33:00.25]And then I clicked on like a corpse and looted a corpse.
[33:02.52]And they called me a clicker.
[33:03.68]I clicked on a corpse, Talix.
[33:05.80]Okay, I click on corpses.
[33:07.48]Because I just don't know any better.
[33:09.14]Talix, what did you say?
[33:09.90]You right-click corpses?
[33:11.56]I do right-click corpses.
[33:12.92]I'm sorry.
[33:15.17]See?
[33:15.95]What's the button?
[33:16.43]I click on ice barrier.
[33:18.31]I probably rebounded whatever the button is like a long time ago.
[33:21.39]Yeah, we'll see when you guys stop making fun of me.
[33:23.01]Now, when we get like in a mythic and you see the raw fucking like DPS that I do as my arcane mage.
[33:28.58]Yeah, you guys are going to quiet the fuck down.
[33:32.94]Bet you didn't even know about this secret.
[33:34.44]Huh?
[33:36.04]Everyone's making fun of me.
[33:36.84]Didn't even know about this secret.
[33:38.64]Oh yeah, what's that?
[33:39.26]I get 2% more damage?
[33:40.36]Didn't even know about that secret.
[33:43.39]Too bad, huh?
[33:45.49]Too bad you didn't know that one.
[33:49.63]Except like everybody does.
[33:52.01]Everybody clicks at least one thing.
[33:55.74]You can't have every single ability on your hot park bound.
[33:59.04]No, you can't.
[34:00.66]That was my point.
[34:05.48]I don't click any of my combat abilities.
[34:12.06]No, neither do I.
[34:15.10]Are you up here in between all these?
[34:16.40]I am.
[34:18.24]Okay.
[34:19.58]I am up there.
[34:20.70]I'll just suck some credit out from that.
[34:23.52]No, but where are you, Talix?
[34:26.06]Where the hell are you?
[34:27.68]Right here.
[34:28.12]Right here.
[34:28.46]Oh, there he is.
[34:28.76]All right, let's look at him.
[34:30.11]Talix is a demon hunter.
[34:31.65]He's a tank demon hunter.
[34:32.33]Oh, I have one of those new expansion, new class scrubs.
[34:35.05]Come here, come here, come here.
[34:36.95]Come here, let's get off the mount.
[34:39.57]We gotta get people, like, a good screenshot.
[34:42.16]Yeah, I just got off the mountain.
[34:43.40]I hit Honey Bun.
[34:45.78]Wait, whoops.
[34:47.38]I went the wrong way.
[34:48.46]Okay, you ready?
[34:49.78]Mm-hmm.
[34:51.26]Three, two, one.
[34:54.67]Get that screenshot.
[34:55.31]Like, I'm a master of arcane.
[34:56.77]He's, like, a thought process sleeper.
[34:58.47]You know what I mean?
[34:59.01]Let's go.
[35:01.47]Thought process sleeper.
[35:02.47]I just, like, broadcasted something to all my friends.
[35:07.79]Wait, what?
[35:08.67]I, like, hit the wrong button and I did, like, WWWWW.
[35:11.81]Apparently I said that to, like, everybody I know.
[35:14.73]Apparently, I don't know.
[35:18.14]Click him.
[35:21.26]He doesn't even have time warp bound.
[35:22.94]Yeah, you do time warp, like, every, like, fucking ten minutes.
[35:25.90]I ain't gonna bind that.
[35:28.83]Gotta, like, blow up your resolution to even bigger.
[35:32.41]No, I can't see.
[35:35.06]Alex, I have a vision problem.
[35:38.18]I know.
[35:38.62]Your quest log is gigantic.
[35:41.47]I have vision problems.
[35:42.73]I can't see.
[35:43.29]I'm old.
[35:43.79]Do you know how old I am now?
[35:45.65]I do.
[35:47.53]I'm not far behind.
[35:48.55]200 fucking million DPS.
[36:04.95]Is somebody attacking you?
[36:06.91]I believe it's a follower.
[36:09.23]We're going to give these people strength, right?
[36:14.64]Let's see if you get credit for this.
[36:17.76]I do.
[36:18.40]Got two out of ten.
[36:19.58]Cool.
[36:19.70]It's been a while since I did any world quests.
[36:26.09]I actually don't think I've ever done this one.
[36:28.81]So...
[36:30.54]So many horde around here.
[36:31.44]I'm glad that, like, we're together because we're definitely gonna get attacked.
[36:35.95]Uh, this way.
[36:36.89]Two nameplates better than one.
[36:38.51]Am I looking forward to turning 80?
[36:43.03]Kind of, yeah.
[36:44.21]You know, Alex, no.
[36:45.01]Let's just, let's show, let's show everybody, like, what we got.
[36:47.03]You know what I mean?
[36:48.45]Let's, like, fucking queue it up.
[36:50.41]You know how, like, how to queue this shit up?
[36:51.75]Oh, I thought you were saying, like, show the horde what we got.
[36:55.13]No, like, get, get, like, them all scooped up together.
[37:00.29]Oh, get them all?
[37:01.11]Like this guy?
[37:02.47]Everybody.
[37:03.15]Every single enemy.
[37:04.15]Hold on, let me click a couple moves.
[37:05.77]Right here?
[37:06.05]This one?
[37:06.35]What are you doing?
[37:06.95]What are you doing?
[37:08.01]Oh.
[37:08.89]Oh, shit.
[37:09.90]No bailing now.
[37:10.48]Get him.
[37:13.78]Everyone.
[37:14.24]We're so dead.
[37:18.26]Why?
[37:19.20]Why did we do this?
[37:20.78]Why did we do this?
[37:21.64]We're not dead yet.
[37:23.32]This is not smart.
[37:23.90]There's a giant fucking sea scrog behind us.
[37:27.08]Dude, there's a sea scrog.
[37:28.48]He's chasing me.
[37:29.16]Yeah.
[37:30.32]I'm still on his tail!
[37:32.32]You gonna get him?
[37:32.82]Good.
[37:33.62]No, he's- now he's trying to get me.
[37:35.21]Now he's running the other way, he just ran past you backwards.
[37:37.99]Yeah, well, I fucking wanted to make sure you were okay.
[37:41.25]He's- he's at full health, did he just, uh, lay on his hands himself?
[37:43.85]Uh, yeah.
[37:45.05]I don't even want to do this.
[37:47.04]There was a sea scrog behind me, I didn't want to fight him.
[37:57.43]Alright, let's just finish this.
[37:58.67]What, are we supposed to yell at ghosts?
[38:02.07]Yeah, we do yell at the ghosts.
[38:03.75]Okay.
[38:04.61]I can do that.
[38:05.71]Can you do this?
[38:08.46]While on the move, with icy flows?
[38:14.96]I love that move so much.
[38:19.03]Raid leader, time warp.
[38:19.97]Now we need to burn the boss.
[38:20.99]Turamo, hold on.
[38:21.57]Give me like five seconds to find this ability on my bar.
[38:24.21]I gotta click it.
[38:25.21]It's right here.
[38:26.56]It's right there.
[38:27.70]It's not like... Look.
[38:29.36]See how easy that was?
[38:30.14]Oh, I'm huge.
[38:32.42]See how easy that just was?
[38:33.36]That doesn't take five seconds.
[38:36.72]That took one second.
[38:39.42]See this guy?
[38:40.24]You see this guy?
[38:41.52]Yeah, you see him?
[38:45.61]I do.
[38:45.85]Oh, what are the... Oh, shit, that upgraded.
[38:50.07]Let him go.
[38:53.77]Let him go.
[38:54.16]He doesn't deserve our fucking time.
[38:56.16]I need two more.
[38:59.08]No, this is way worse.
[39:04.55]This guy right there?
[39:05.49]Can you do it to that guy?
[39:06.21]Nope.
[39:07.05]Can I assist you?
[39:09.05]Nope.
[39:09.99]They are already amped.
[39:11.99]They're ready to go already.
[39:13.85]Nothing we can yell at them will make them any more excited to be ghosts.
[39:19.65]Thanks, Ace of Dens, for the subscription.
[39:21.61]Thank you, Yuveins, for the 75 bits.
[39:24.16]Calling me a chicken.
[39:25.14]No, he said chicken.
[39:25.84]Oh, okay, I see what he did there.
[39:26.84]Thanks for the 75 bits, dude.
[39:28.14]Oh, no, it was 100 bits.
[39:30.74]I think so.
[39:32.00]But what is he going to do?
[39:33.78]Nothing.
[39:35.46]Oh, upgraded.
[39:51.77]Get it, because I can't see.
[40:01.15]Don't let him go.
[40:03.07]What is going on?
[40:06.92]What, did he try to pour it out?
[40:08.18]Yeah.
[40:14.46]We're such bullies.
[40:16.64]Come on, you got a friend there.
[40:17.58]You got like two friends.
[40:18.66]Let's start a fucking riot.
[40:22.10]Alright, let's go.
[40:22.94]Did you get it?
[40:23.28]Inside of this room would probably be the worst place.
[40:25.68]Yeah, it would.
[40:26.12]To do that.
[40:27.24]It would.
[40:27.50]There's probably at least four AFK people in there.
[40:31.22]No, there's more like seven.
[40:34.98]Are we doing it?
[40:36.07]Do it!
[40:37.43]Pop every cooldown.
[40:42.73]I'm okay.
[40:45.41]How many of them are actually AFK?
[40:47.11]How many people are AFK?
[40:48.21]That's the question.
[40:50.43]Run away!
[40:55.55]I'm so slow!
[40:56.93]Kill this guy!
[40:58.15]Kill this fucking- Kill Julian!
[41:00.23]I'm dead.
[41:02.18]They got me.
[41:04.60]We did start a riot though.
[41:05.98]So, I'm okay.
[41:15.78]I love that shit.
[41:18.92]Yeah, you think you can go AFK in my server?
[41:22.28]On my realm?
[41:23.88]Turns out they weren't AFK, though.
[41:25.92]Yeah, it turns out they weren't.
[41:27.20]Oh, well.
[41:30.82]None of the loss.
[41:31.60]It was like two versus ten.
[41:33.40]Hey, I didn't see him click anything.
[41:38.35]Did you guys?
[41:42.45]Wait, what?
[41:44.13]I used all my cooldowns.
[41:46.95]I got locked.
[41:48.62]I couldn't even.
[41:50.80]I'm looking at chat, sorry.
[41:52.16]Christopher Walken, thanks for the eight months.
[41:53.50]Do you have to go all the way around to get back there?
[42:00.19]Or is there a bridge that I don't know about?
[42:06.47]Did you go all the way to the top and wrap around, or did you go underneath?
[42:11.31]I went straight to the top.
[42:12.43]I didn't have to take any special route.
[42:15.47]Really?
[42:18.35]Where are you?
[42:19.18]I don't know.
[42:20.58]I was looking over at the fucking chat and I was walking into a rock.
[42:25.58]I was walking into walls because I had my eyes on the other screen, on the other monitor.
[42:38.85]Can we see your secret RP server main?
[42:40.86]No, my main was Electric Man, and then they buffed Red Paladin and made him really boring.
[42:45.76]So I stopped playing it.
[42:48.22]RP servers.
[42:49.80]Oh, boy.
[42:50.14]We got to get out of here.
[42:52.30]You're down here, right?
[42:53.72]Oh, yeah.
[42:54.58]So just jump right off the edge to go to Mixology Mixup.
[43:00.30]All right.
[43:02.24]Mm-hmm.
[43:02.94]So I'm going.
[43:09.00]Okay, cool.
[43:17.96]20 murloc guys.
[43:18.72]Wow, that's so many.
[43:20.18]So we're going to have to flex our muscles.
[43:22.44]What's going on over here?
[43:24.74]Flexing my muscles.
[43:25.78]No, but that's not you.
[43:26.52]That's not you.
[43:30.42]The italics I know would have gotten like the whole camp, and I mean the entire camp.
[43:36.12]This is most of the camp.
[43:37.98]No, no, no.
[43:38.56]I'm talking about the entire camp.
[43:40.83]Every single one.
[43:42.07]There's not... They don't have long enough leashes to do that.
[43:45.37]No, no, no.
[43:45.93]Wait, wait, wait.
[43:46.41]Give me a second.
[43:47.05]We've got a spy.
[43:47.97]Who?
[43:49.07]There's a spy to your left.
[43:50.88]The fuck?
[43:53.26]That guy.
[43:55.99]Why are we being spied on?
[44:00.83]How did you find us?
[44:01.87]Oh, he's probably watching the stream.
[44:03.56]Yeah.
[44:05.16]Boo has entered the... Hey, Boo.
[44:07.34]That's Boo, by the way.
[44:09.48]He's just like, oh, get me the fuck out of here.
[44:13.22]Alright, you ready to get them all?
[44:16.32]Every single one.
[44:18.79]If I see one person that didn't get got, then it's your neck on the chopping block.
[44:25.61]Everyone.
[44:27.19]More.
[44:29.33]Get more.
[44:31.02]More.
[44:34.14]They're all like casters.
[44:35.76]They're all casters.
[44:36.94]Come over here.
[44:39.12]That's as many as I think I can feasibly do.
[44:43.19]I'm being attacked by a PvP man.
[44:45.12]Are you serious?
[44:46.36]Yeah.
[44:49.46]Oh, this fucking guy's dead.
[44:50.56]It shrinks.
[44:53.88]I'm gonna clean up these shitties and then get this dude.
[44:59.05]Tab targeting, please!
[45:00.47]Fucking Jesus, I hate this new tab targeting so much.
[45:15.18]Concentrating.
[45:15.66]Concentrating.
[45:16.04]What the fuck?
[45:16.52]Concentrating.
[45:23.93]What's he doing?
[45:24.45]Uh, I think I feared him.
[45:30.99]Oh, there's another person has entered the fray.
[45:33.86]Oh god, really?
[45:35.18]Yeah.
[45:38.10]That's what we get for, like, aggroing fucking a hundred people.
[45:46.57]God, Blizzard, your fucking new tab targeting makes me want to die.
[45:53.00]I got the first guy.
[45:54.62]You got a guy coming up behind you.
[45:56.18]Yeah, he's gonna kill me.
[45:57.52]Like, tab targeting should prioritize PvP.
[46:00.53]I don't know why it doesn't.
[46:02.65]Actually, two guys coming up behind me.
[46:04.21]Are you sure you didn't want to, like, target the fucking guy, like, across the map behind the guy that's attacking the shit out of you right now?
[46:11.60]Alright, well, I got, uh, 3v1'd, but I did kill the first guy, so I'll take that as a win.
[46:17.46]And we got most of the murlocs, um, but I failed to loot a single one.
[46:21.76]Oh my fucking god.
[46:25.92]That's... how much?
[46:27.16]Hold on a second.
[46:27.96]Okay, give me one second.
[46:31.11]Twelve fucking thousand five hundred bits.
[46:35.29]Jesus, dude.
[46:36.65]That's a hundred and twenty-five bucks.
[46:39.03]Why are you dead?
[46:41.89]For the funniest man alive.
[46:43.33]I don't know if I deserve that title.
[46:44.77]At least another year elapsed in being my role model.
[46:47.43]Never stop being yourself, Jerma.
[46:48.53]You're something special for real.
[46:50.93]Well, you never stop being yourself, dude.
[46:56.63]I'm just glad that you've been able to enjoy the dumb shit that I've been doing over the years.
[47:01.78]Thanks a lot, man.
[47:02.32]I appreciate it.
[47:03.52]Much love to you, dude.
[47:06.64]That's 500 billion dollars.
[47:10.53]So, thank you so much, man.
[47:12.69]And then CJ2K comes in with a subscription.
[47:16.85]Christopher Walken with a subscription as well.
[47:18.53]Eight months.
[47:19.93]And we had some bits.
[47:20.63]Ace of Dens with a subscription.
[47:22.24]U-Vains.
[47:23.02]U-Vains, U-Vains.
[47:23.66]I got U-Vains before.
[47:24.64]Drunk Orson Welles with 100 bits.
[47:26.54]When are we going to see Flanker in WoW?
[47:28.24]I don't know.
[47:30.16]I just got flanked.
[47:31.08]I got flank-ganked.
[47:36.18]Never stop being yourself.
[47:37.38]More like... No, that's not true.
[47:40.46]More like never stop giving me money.
[47:41.78]That's not true.
[47:44.41]If you know me well, you know that it's not about that.
[47:50.63]But I'm always shocked that people are willing to part with that kind of money.
[47:56.59]But just some shithead online that just makes it like, hey, hey, I make the noise.
[48:01.50]I don't know.
[48:03.88]I can't believe that people are willing to part with that kind of money, man.
[48:08.12]It's a lot.
[48:10.46]It's never necessary, but always greatly appreciated.
[48:14.68]And then Premium Pillow for 200 bits.
[48:17.70]This is a little I can do.
[48:20.48]Don't worry, I've said this before and I'm gonna just reiterate it one more time.
[48:26.90]Don't ever feel obligated to give me money.
[48:28.94]Really don't.
[48:31.32]If you see somebody drop like a hundred bucks, don't be like, hold on a second!
[48:35.14]I gotta get like 30 bucks in there!
[48:36.94]It's like, it's okay.
[48:38.56]Just hang out, you don't have to feel obligated at all.
[48:42.28]I love each and every one of you as if you were my children.
[48:45.04]So don't worry.
[48:48.90]Let's get back to getting our asses kicked in World of Warcraft.
[48:55.03]Please make the noise.
[48:56.93]What is... Why am I getting... Oh, you're here.
[48:58.41]Hi, sorry.
[49:02.31]Hello.
[49:02.63]Are these bad guys?
[49:03.33]Uh... Okay, see that tab targeting?
[49:05.67]I'm just... I just... I just fucking hit that guy.
[49:07.76]I wanted to hit the goddamn murloc in front of me.
[49:10.06]He shouldn't walk right in the middle of us while we're fighting if he doesn't want to get hit.
[49:17.40]Never trust purple again.
[49:18.62]Laughs are a priceless commodity in today's world.
[49:20.98]You're not even bargain bin on like 700,000 games.
[49:25.30]Well, thanks, man.
[49:28.10]I like to hope that at least some people will laugh and enjoy the hanging out and streaming and videos.
[49:36.46]And that's why I do it.
[49:39.73]I never got into this whole game.
[49:42.37]For any other reason besides I liked to talk, I liked to joke around.
[49:46.49]And a certain group of the internet thought the things I had to say were funny, I guess.
[49:53.28]I didn't get into it for any other reason besides to try to, like, have fun.
[49:57.18]And once I stop having fun, I'm not gonna just keep going.
[50:02.74]That might sound depressing, but I do it for fun.
[50:05.68]I do it because I like the community.
[50:07.88]That's it.
[50:10.25]No other reason.
[50:13.79]I wouldn't have dropped seven fucking thousand dollars on a stupid wrestling video if I didn't, like, love you guys.
[50:20.37]That's, like, true.
[50:24.41]That's the truth.
[50:26.49]You want, like, a cry stream?
[50:28.23]I'm gonna start fucking crying.
[50:36.22]Stop shaving.
[50:43.91]We have to make sure Trevor's having fun until he dies.
[50:46.47]Thanks, PremiumPillow, for the 500 bits.
[50:51.72]Thank you, PremiumPillow, with almost 1,000 there.
[50:53.84]Thanks, man.
[50:56.27]And then human mail 100 real dollars to cry on stream and get money.
[51:01.54]No.
[51:08.09]Cry so I can drink your tears.
[51:14.23]Drink.
[51:15.55]Drink my tears.
[51:17.78]They're filling.
[51:23.52]sap him?
[51:24.65]I don't have sap.
[51:25.53]I'm a mage.
[51:31.51]I'm like muted.
[51:32.51]Oh my god, I forgot I'm muted.
[51:33.51]Sorry, Italics.
[51:34.19]Hi, welcome back.
[51:36.01]Welcome back.
[51:38.95]I was just kind of following you around.
[51:41.51]Probably something serious going on over there.
[51:43.75]Be patient.
[51:45.91]Why did it tap target this guy?
[51:49.64]What?
[51:51.91]He was like not even fucking close.
[51:56.71]Okay, that is like the oddest thing fucking ever.
[51:59.63]It won't get off of him.
[52:01.19]I'm mashing tab right now.
[52:02.64]It won't leave that guy alone.
[52:05.54]What the fuck?
[52:11.34]Why did it target that guy?
[52:15.12]Oh, that was insane.
[52:18.64]Insta-kill that guy.
[52:19.53]No big deal.
[52:20.09]Is he in a cave or up here?
[52:21.39]I don't know.
[52:22.49]I think he's in a cave.
[52:23.85]I need his egg.
[52:24.41]You want to apologize to this druid here?
[52:31.60]Well, I didn't mean to.
[52:32.82]I didn't mean to.
[52:46.37]Oh, I didn't get a proc.
[52:47.16]I didn't get a proc.
[52:47.86]Not cool.
[52:51.86]Get his egg.
[52:56.38]Oh, yeah.
[52:58.42]Yes, thank you.
[53:01.73]We have one more to do.
[53:04.01]Blow your whistle.
[53:04.81]Toot toot.
[53:07.53]What do you think is easier to do?
[53:12.03]You know, let's go down and, uh... You wanna go down and kill this dude, this Torrentius?
[53:18.47]Uh, sure.
[53:20.69]So we gotta go down to the Warden's Redoubt.
[53:24.29]Warden's Redoubt.
[53:28.65]I don't even have the other flight path there.
[53:31.61]Sort of steamy, thanks for the thousand bits.
[53:33.23]Guess we admitted to being the Christmas tree last night.
[53:35.37]I think there's only one flight path, isn't there?
[53:37.45]Didn't he stream?
[53:38.96]I'll give you one second.
[53:40.02]I'm responding to an important thing.
[53:43.02]Very important.
[53:43.66]This is about the Christmas.
[53:44.82]Very.
[53:48.71]Yeah.
[53:49.35]So he streamed with the mask on, didn't he?
[53:51.33]Like last week.
[53:54.22]He's the Christmas tree star.
[53:56.00]He had the mask on during one of his streams apparently.
[53:59.48]Go ahead.
[54:01.92]You're just like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[54:03.84]I have no idea.
[54:08.92]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[54:09.80]I only watch cool streamers.
[54:12.54]Oh man, does that mean am I on that list?
[54:15.90]Yeah, why would I be here otherwise?
[54:17.84]Ha, Ashley.
[54:20.20]Oh, that's a bird.
[54:21.96]That's a cigarette bird.
[54:25.70]But, uh, thanks for the 1,000 bits, dude.
[54:27.82]Thanks, Premium Pillow, for your exactly 1,000.
[54:29.76]Human male.
[54:32.22]For 100.
[54:33.67]The human male.
[54:34.69]I'm a human male.
[54:35.93]That's what my character is.
[54:41.11]Alright.
[54:41.51]Am I muted?
[54:41.95]Can you hear me?
[54:44.04]No, now you can hear me.
[54:45.74]Yeah.
[54:46.80]Wait, wait for me.
[54:47.28]I gotta get this AA throttle.
[54:52.20]Alright, let's go.
[54:52.86]Let's go.
[54:53.20]Jocko performs herb gathering.
[54:55.16]Yeah, Jocko.
[54:56.68]Why is that a notification?
[54:58.22]I don't know.
[55:01.76]Why is that a notification?
[55:03.26]Don't fuck with these guys.
[55:04.52]These are all, like, elite satalics.
[55:05.74]Oh, yeah.
[55:06.24]This is the elite zone.
[55:07.48]I forgot.
[55:10.04]Let me take all the aggro.
[55:11.66]Human, male, and real life.
[55:13.16]Yeah, you go first.
[55:18.91]What am I doing?
[55:19.29]I need to, like, trail behind you.
[55:25.77]You think we can 2v1 this guy?
[55:29.92]Um... Oh, yeah.
[55:32.02]Oh, yeah, he says.
[55:33.74]You go first.
[55:34.24]I don't want to aggro these guys.
[55:35.26]I don't want to get murdered.
[55:38.84]So, are you going to start screaming at Alex?
[55:40.61]Is that the plan for you?
[55:41.45]Are you going to turn your scream on?
[55:42.49]That is the plan.
[55:43.73]If you're here for World of Warcraft, you won't be seeing any of that, but it's a fun game.
[55:50.97]Great game.
[55:51.83]I've spent... How many hours?
[55:54.59]Do a slash play, unless you're embarrassed.
[55:56.84]No, I refuse.
[55:57.60]Okay.
[55:58.50]Well, my slash play is... That's not that bad.
[56:02.72]Eight days, six hours on this character.
[56:05.12]You have more than I do.
[56:06.02]Oh, never mind.
[56:06.70]It's because this is Jocko.
[56:08.35]Electric Man probably has, like, the same amount.
[56:12.72]Alright, you ready?
[56:13.26]This is where we're going to see the real DPS area.
[56:16.81]I'm going to try my absolute heart out here.
[56:19.61]I only have three charges, though.
[56:22.65]54 million HP.
[56:23.78]Alright.
[56:24.76]God damn it, really?
[56:25.54]This guy's going to do this shit.
[56:30.30]I have this one random more than I can chew.
[56:33.88]What the fuck?
[56:34.76]Okay, we have to, like, avoid this, apparently?
[56:36.74]Oh, yeah.
[56:37.96]I'm totally solidized right now.
[56:40.26]We didn't have this one.
[56:41.04]This guy's elite, too, by the way.
[56:42.40]Yeah, this guy's... We gotta kill this fucking thing.
[56:46.64]Is he dead?
[56:48.82]I got ice blocked, and I couldn't move for 15 seconds.
[56:52.72]I couldn't do anything for 15 seconds.
[56:54.93]And for my next trick... Hey!
[56:58.99]Get me out of here.
[57:02.05]I don't think we can 2v1 this guy.
[57:03.45]He's got 54 million health.
[57:04.71]As long as I avoid the big circle.
[57:08.99]We gotta kill these fucking adds on the side so they're just gonna aggro.
[57:13.27]These guys are no joke.
[57:14.17]These dudes are fucking elites.
[57:19.62]Talix, I need help.
[57:20.38]I'm coming.
[57:22.36]Talix, they're looming over me right now.
[57:26.14]I'm just a wee little wisp.
[57:27.80]I actually might be able to kill these guys if I... I don't know.
[57:36.40]You think you can heal yourself to death?
[57:39.38]To death?
[57:40.58]You think you can heal yourself to death?
[57:45.60]What the fuck?
[57:46.46]He's not even aggroed.
[57:47.26]Why is he doing that move?
[57:49.06]Only if I'm a priest with... How can I?
[57:50.80]Soul priest.
[57:53.42]Am I at a range of that over here?
[57:55.69]Who is he doing that to?
[57:59.35]Who is he fighting right now?
[58:00.99]Look at his health.
[58:03.90]There's nobody even here.
[58:06.08]He still has 48 melee and he has a reset.
[58:08.38]Yeah, he's casting moves at random people.
[58:10.62]Oh my goodness.
[58:11.97]Yeah, get on this ledge.
[58:13.53]No, actually, no, you don't.
[58:14.41]I'm going to go fight these little hate-poiled guardians here.
[58:17.59]Okay.
[58:26.80]This is going to be arcane charges so I can actually hurt people.
[58:38.42]Can I please get Arcane Missiles?
[58:40.53]Can that proc please God?
[58:42.15]Please God in heaven?
[58:51.44]Okay.
[58:54.02]Anyone else you want to kill?
[58:56.24]There's a patrol that goes all the way around.
[58:58.20]Hopefully we can just kill them.
[59:01.12]No, that's like the most overpowered enemy in the whole game.
[59:05.23]That's why we gotta kill him now before he becomes a real threat.
[59:07.24]This guy looks like a pilot light.
[59:10.96]He kinda does.
[59:13.90]Alright, are you ready?
[59:15.44]Give me a light, give me a drink because Arcane sucks.
[59:19.24]What about this crab?
[59:21.47]Yeah, get rid of all the crabs.
[59:28.79]Got to interrupt pinch.
[59:30.13]One-shot kill.
[59:31.03]See, these guys are like, hold on.
[59:32.29]There's a troll shop over there.
[59:33.33]There's more behind him.
[59:35.59]He is dying.
[59:37.27]Yeah, those guys are no joke.
[59:39.17]Hold this Ravager over here.
[59:40.33]I hate calling it Ravager.
[59:44.94]We got to clear this place out.
[59:46.20]I feel like I'm in an actual dungeon right now.
[59:49.36]I don't know, really.
[60:02.41]And get the guy right next to him.
[60:03.97]Oh my gosh.
[60:06.19]One by one, they filter in.
[60:08.12]One by one.
[60:10.66]Step by step.
[60:14.84]Step by step.
[60:16.72]Day by day.
[60:18.62]What is that?
[60:22.04]Full house, right?
[60:24.42]No, that's not Full House.
[60:25.24]What is that?
[60:26.48]Step by step.
[60:28.48]Day by day.
[60:32.01]It's like a 90s sitcom.
[60:33.99]I think it was.
[60:34.43]It's a show called Step by Step.
[60:37.59]I think it was.
[60:38.11]Alright, go get him.
[60:39.65]Wait ten seconds.
[60:41.23]Which one do we have to run away from?
[60:42.59]I don't know.
[60:43.63]Just kill him.
[60:45.99]I think we tried that last time.
[60:47.25]You have to deal with that.
[60:47.95]I'm on the fucking rook.
[60:49.99]Alright, three, two, one.
[60:54.02]Action!
[60:57.06]It's when the ground goes all circular-y.
[60:59.58]Yeah, that's something you gotta deal with, buddy.
[61:05.01]I can't interrupt any of this shit.
[61:06.41]Is it explosive guys?
[61:07.45]No.
[61:07.51]I just have to move.
[61:12.09]Freezing mist.
[61:13.01]That's the one.
[61:13.53]Yeah, I can just stand here and bomb on them.
[61:21.39]Long cast.
[61:22.37]That is very long.
[61:27.57]That is super long.
[61:28.61]Is this guy's name Tinnitus?
[61:34.42]Tinnitus?
[61:35.56]Tinnitus.
[61:38.76]Shit, I'm gonna lose quickening.
[61:40.94]Let me not.
[61:41.76]Yeah, I will.
[61:46.26]Let's go for it!
[61:51.46]Every time.
[62:03.90]Am I running the edge?
[62:04.62]I am.
[62:08.12]I'm burning through too much mana.
[62:09.42]This is so tedious.
[62:11.87]I know.
[62:12.11]This is going to take a million years.
[62:13.43]Ooh.
[62:26.54]Ooh.
[62:28.04]Ooh.
[62:33.51]You having fun back here?
[62:34.49]I'm just checking in on you every few seconds.
[62:36.23]Just make sure you're okay.
[62:37.65]I had to, like, go early into the conserved phase.
[62:39.87]Don't forget to pop your ult.
[62:48.44]I know.
[62:48.62]I gotta use my ult here.
[62:53.14]Dude, I can't wait to see what we get here.
[62:55.68]Hey, time for your momentary check-in.
[62:58.32]Just, again, get right up in your face just to inspect you.
[63:01.48]Hey, how are you?
[63:04.20]Okay, I'm going to be able to start.
[63:06.66]Oh, no!
[63:07.62]Oh, no!
[63:09.08]Oh, no!
[63:10.50]We're fine.
[63:15.20]Alright, we're going to burn here.
[63:16.48]I'm going to dump all my mana.
[63:21.06]And then...
[63:24.70]Feel the burn!
[63:30.91]This reward better be worth it.
[63:32.47]That's all I gotta say.
[63:33.55]It won't be.
[63:33.95]Alright, just to make everyone mad, start clicking all of your abilities.
[63:46.52]I will not.
[63:49.38]He's gonna die, don't worry.
[63:53.68]I'm not even gonna move.
[63:54.92]Nice!
[63:55.42]Nice!
[63:56.13]Oh, good!
[63:57.03]What did I get?
[63:57.55]High bone drape.
[63:58.67]Cool.
[63:59.21]Too bad it sucks.
[64:02.17]We did it.
[64:03.33]Where's his body?
[64:07.41]Uh... You see all this sparkly, uh, stuff, right?
[64:12.26]Yeah, I looted him.
[64:14.56]He probably has, like, one little shirt cuff.
[64:16.94]It was one gray.
[64:18.32]Yeah.
[64:19.50]Oh, whatever.
[64:20.54]It was a wrist cuff.
[64:22.95]Alright, now we blow the whistle and go back to... Giladaristan to get your box.
[64:28.39]Time to open up the box.
[64:31.47]Thanks a lot, Shortles or Stortles.
[64:33.37]Elemental Droplets.
[64:34.93]I just scooped up one drop of water from this pond.
[64:39.35]Thanks a lot, NotBigBoy, for your subscription.
[64:41.53]Never trust a purple again.
[64:42.47]Use your entertainer skills to distract them.
[64:45.65]Make the noise.
[64:50.95]Thanks, dude.
[64:52.95]Sort of steamy with a thousand bits.
[64:54.13]Did I get... Did I see you?
[64:55.29]Oh, yeah.
[64:57.29]Okay.
[64:57.59]I'm just making sure I didn't miss anyone.
[65:00.37]Thanks, guys.
[65:01.97]You ready to get our box?
[65:04.87]Dude, this is why you do those four quests.
[65:08.32]You do four in a random zone, whatever the emissary is.
[65:10.54]Because we're gonna get a fucking loot box.
[65:14.20]And mine's gonna have a legendary in it.
[65:16.02]Yeah.
[65:18.40]Gonna have a big orange beam that stretches to the heavens.
[65:25.82]And chat is going to explode.
[65:27.74]Dude, if I get a legendary, oh man, I can't wait to see all the POG champs.
[65:34.81]Ever made it up to Worcester?
[65:36.21]I just moved out of my place.
[65:38.41]Um... Not in a long time.
[65:42.05]I used to go to Worcester to watch my brother play baseball.
[65:44.41]How do you say that?
[65:45.31]Worcester.
[65:47.69]Not Worchester.
[65:49.91]My brother used to play baseball all the time out there.
[65:51.80]I would go to his games and watch.
[65:56.07]Whoa!
[66:03.69]Air North.
[66:07.23]Air North with 100 bucks.
[66:10.22]From Dunk Live TV.
[66:12.94]He says you should click to ban me.
[66:16.96]No, I ain't banning you.
[66:20.16]Thanks a lot, man.
[66:24.36]Jeez.
[66:28.30]The only emote you're going to get is fail, bitch.
[66:32.71]Well, Dunk Life TV.
[66:34.71]Is that Dunkey?
[66:36.59]Dunkey is hilarious.
[66:40.93]Ban him.
[66:41.54]Ban him.
[66:41.92]Click him.
[66:42.34]Click to ban.
[66:43.32]That's one... No.
[66:43.78]That is... That is $101 bills.
[66:48.77]From Aeronorth.
[66:50.31]Who is a good dude.
[66:52.93]Thanks a lot, man.
[66:54.83]And then we got HyperXyfarian.
[66:58.23]Thanks for something.
[67:00.67]The first $100 ban.
[67:01.47]Alright, where's my box?
[67:04.36]Did I even get it yet?
[67:06.06]No, you gotta like run around here.
[67:12.14]Yeah, sorry.
[67:12.48]It was muted.
[67:14.96]Hi.
[67:16.38]Did you get a legendary?
[67:17.48]Uh, I haven't opened the box yet.
[67:19.90]Oh.
[67:21.26]I did, and I, um, I mean, it's been a while since I've done any of these world quests, but I actually... Did they finally patch it so you don't get eight tens for loot?
[67:30.09]I believe they did, like, a stealth hotfix so you don't get that shit anymore.
[67:33.41]Okay.
[67:33.67]Because that was really, really annoying.
[67:35.19]That was super annoying.
[67:37.73]Like, I should be able to jump up this trunk.
[67:39.91]Like, what?
[67:43.12]Does sorcery come back tomorrow?
[67:44.72]Never trust a purple.
[67:46.68]Maybe.
[67:46.98]It depends on if the internet gets fixed.
[67:51.53]It's like a ticking time bomb right now.
[67:53.07]It is.
[67:53.55]It is a ticking time bomb.
[67:55.83]How am I doing?
[67:56.71]Diabeetles, I'm doing great.
[67:57.77]Hope you're doing good, too.
[67:58.51]Alright, here's our box.
[68:00.81]First, let's drink up some artifact powder.
[68:05.81]Ever since she said that, I can't get it out of my head.
[68:07.85]Artifact powder.
[68:09.29]It should be powder.
[68:11.19]Alright, here's my loot box.
[68:12.63]Come on.
[68:13.95]Come on.
[68:14.79]We did all that work to get this box.
[68:17.19]Legendary.
[68:20.67]I saw that color and I was like, no.
[68:25.73]These are not crit mastery.
[68:27.65]Too bad they didn't roll up.
[68:29.27]Because those would be better if they rolled up to an 845 or 850.
[68:32.05]I had 835s as well.
[68:36.35]Shit.
[68:40.74]No legendary for me.
[68:45.18]Alright.
[68:46.40]So.
[68:48.48]Now...
[68:50.31]For the main event.
[68:51.29]For the main event, before the internet dies, do you want to do a mythic with like three people potentially that are subbed or something that are like eye level 835 or something?
[69:07.34]What do you need to be mythic?
[69:08.22]Like 830, 835?
[69:08.38]I think it's 810 for heroics.
[69:09.30]Okay.
[69:11.70]And then the 830 or 825, something for mythic?
[69:15.06]Yeah.
[69:15.36]Yeah.
[69:19.28]So the question is that if anybody here that's a sub, any of you guys have this game, you're alliance, you're in like a US server, and you're like 830, 840 eye level.
[69:26.96]Because I would, me and Alex would love to do a mythic with you.
[69:31.56]I'm going to do a sub mythic game here.
[69:34.22]I have no idea how I'm going to do this.
[69:35.70]Because what if like a shitload of people are like, you know, oh yeah, there's like 100 people in the chat.
[69:41.04]I think the fair way to do it is to make a group finder.
[69:45.76]And just take the first three people that meet the qualifications.
[69:49.90]Yeah, probably.
[69:51.90]And then when they join, then you go like, hey, are you here for Jermod?
[69:55.22]Like just in case it's somebody else that's like randomly accidentally joins your mythic group.
[70:00.16]But then if I'm trying to limit it to like subs only, how would that even work?
[70:04.21]Oh.
[70:05.50]Well, do you have one of the... The other way would be... Do you have one of the lottery plugins?
[70:11.76]I don't think I do.
[70:13.78]I could probably get it quick, though.
[70:16.00]I believe it is a Google Chrome app.
[70:18.50]Yeah, let's see if I can just grab... I don't even know how to use it.
[70:21.37]It's really easy.
[70:24.13]If you install it, you just link it up.
[70:26.99]Actually, you don't have to link it, probably.
[70:28.45]DPS lower than 250.
[70:30.23]Please don't join my raid group.
[70:31.65]Okay.
[70:34.92]I'll try.
[70:35.52]I'll try to join as much as I can.
[70:41.68]All right.
[70:41.88]Well, I'm trying to think of the best way to do this if we don't do that.
[70:48.62]By the way, I feel like this is the most amount of people are here that are going to hang out here.
[70:54.00]They can whisper group leader when they apply.
[70:55.74]All right.
[70:56.86]Boo, you got to get in.
[70:57.69]Boo, get in here.
[70:58.41]You got to tell me how to do this.
[71:01.26]Boo, you gotta get in here.
[71:02.64]If you have a plan, you need to tell me what it is.
[71:06.90]Boo seems to have a plan.
[71:09.86]He's watching from the fringe.
[71:11.45]Have the entire stream join you and just run into Ogremar?
[71:14.19]That actually might be fucking hilarious.
[71:19.57]How many people in this stream have WoW and do you want to run into Ogremar?
[71:24.13]They would have to be on my neighboring servers, though, wouldn't they?
[71:27.20]That's why I say at least a US server.
[71:29.62]I'm pretty sure we could just get a raid going.
[71:33.99]That would be pretty funny.
[71:37.33]I'm going to go back to my class hall.
[71:39.52]And you have to be Alliance.
[71:45.26]Yeah, you have to be Alliance.
[71:54.66]Oh, fuck, I have to get wow now.
[71:58.28]You don't necessarily have to do anything.
[71:59.54]Oh, please don't.
[72:00.52]That would be awful.
[72:01.90]Do not, like, buy a subscription and buy an account just to do this dumb thing.
[72:07.08]Especially if you're going to be, like, level one.
[72:08.42]Oh, hi, Boo.
[72:08.89]All right, so, Boo, what's your plan?
[72:11.03]Well, you said you were going to make a group find a group, but when people apply to it, they have an option to whisper the group leader, so they can just be like, fuck you.
[72:19.67]You could say, okay, just sign up and whisper...
[72:23.85]Fluggity boogity.
[72:25.13]And if they do, then they're one of your subs.
[72:27.09]Oh, okay.
[72:28.53]Okay.
[72:31.05]Okay.
[72:31.53]That's one option.
[72:32.91]Or you can just run into Aggramar and die.
[72:34.37]I have a moral obligation to interject and say, Boo is in the call!
[72:40.40]Oh, there he is!
[72:41.40]Hey, Boo, how are ya?
[72:43.34]I'd be violating my conscience otherwise.
[72:49.67]You know, you know, a whole faction leader in a city like Sylvanas is typically in Undercity and in, who else is there?
[72:58.84]Blood Elf leader is Lothmar.
[73:00.72]Do you know who's in Orgrimmar right now?
[73:02.00]Who is it?
[73:05.08]Garrosh went and Vol'jin's not here anymore.
[73:07.12]It's our thing.
[73:09.64]Is it really?
[73:10.12]Yeah.
[73:12.18]Well, Boo, do you want to do any like on stream?
[73:15.75]Like everyone makes fun of you, Mythic?
[73:18.43]Oh, yeah.
[73:18.73]I love getting made fun of.
[73:20.30]Alright, well, Italics, please invite him to the group if you'd like to hang around and do a mythic or two.
[73:28.23]On stream, where people make fun of you for clicking moves, because I click, like, three of my moves that aren't, like, important moves.
[73:36.39]Good thing I'm not watching.
[73:37.21]Whoever the third sub is, you just got removed from the group.
[73:43.07]Boo replaced you.
[73:44.27]Oh, shit.
[73:44.61]I'll be a healer at least.
[73:49.40]Let's see.
[73:50.46]Hey, you know what might be fun?
[73:52.01]Who's a sub that has this game?
[73:54.81]Whisper.
[73:57.29]Jocko.
[73:58.45]Here's what you have to do.
[73:59.37]You have to confirm your name.
[74:02.27]How the fuck do we do this?
[74:06.95]Because couldn't somebody just pretend to be somebody in the chat?
[74:12.18]I think they'd have to whisper...
[74:15.23]Oh, yeah.
[74:16.04]OK, look.
[74:16.68]Hang on.
[74:16.98]Let me leave group, and I'll show you.
[74:17.90]So you can show on stream what you're doing.
[74:19.64]So I'm going to make a group.
[74:22.98]I'll go in dungeons, because that's where it would be.
[74:26.14]It's a bunch of numbers.
[74:31.04]So look for my group in the dungeon thing.
[74:34.93]I see it.
[74:37.71]Can you like write, when you apply, can you have like an option to whisper the group leader?
[74:41.71]Uh, it's great out.
[74:42.63]You must sign up for this.
[74:43.69]You must sign up for this group to whisper the group leader, but I think I should too.
[74:47.09]Like, okay.
[74:48.90]Just sign up and have the option to whisper.
[74:51.08]And then you, you have like your own little stream password.
[74:54.88]Uh, oh, oh.
[74:57.48]Your little keyword.
[74:58.26]That's like the, the pass to get in.
[75:02.04]Okay.
[75:02.50]So let me do lead.
[75:05.65]Pass me lead italics.
[75:07.97]I first didn't get bum squash in here.
[75:09.63]I definitely invited him.
[75:11.21]He left the party.
[75:12.35]Yeah, I left to show you that.
[75:13.48]Yeah, just to show this to me.
[75:14.82]Oh.
[75:16.88]No, you invite him.
[75:18.74]I'll invite him.
[75:19.44]You invite him up here.
[75:21.96]Oh, whatever.
[75:22.30]Give me the thing.
[75:23.44]Take it.
[75:27.43]Yellow bits icon.
[75:28.57]Oh, wait.
[75:28.99]We got a yellow.
[75:29.67]We got a fucking firecracker in the chat.
[75:34.72]Thanks a lot, Backup25.
[75:36.30]And ArchLux, both you guys, for your subscriptions, welcome.
[75:42.00]All level ones rushing somewhere.
[75:45.11]We would get instantly killed.
[75:46.93]Somebody would drop one AoE and kill like 45 people.
[75:53.36]I think I figured out how to do it.
[75:54.94]Hold on.
[75:55.96]Hi, let's do five-man content.
[75:57.20]Oh, my God.
[75:58.00]I'll heal.
[75:59.58]Slowly, we are getting rid of the whole point.
[76:03.44]All right, now we're done.
[76:04.10]I got four people now to stream.
[76:05.89]All right, now we need one more person.
[76:08.19]I love how we're slowly filling it up.
[76:12.05]Wait, we've got Mariah.
[76:14.49]You know I'm streaming, right?
[76:16.18]Yeah, I'll heal.
[76:17.34]So, hold on.
[76:18.10]We are just doing five-man mythics with the five of us.
[76:20.64]We're not doing... I'm a good shaman healer.
[76:23.52]What the fuck?
[76:24.40]And Boo can do damage.
[76:29.90]Oh, dear.
[76:30.36]Well... Okay.
[76:32.50]What, were you going to run mythics with viewers?
[76:36.47]We were trying to figure out... That was the idea, yeah.
[76:39.05]Oh, it actually was?
[76:40.11]Well, we were thinking about it, yeah.
[76:41.43]Well, we... Depending on how long... It was verbally spoken.
[76:44.93]It was verbally spoken.
[76:48.49]All right.
[76:48.77]Yeah, I was trying to make things easier.
[76:51.15]You know, if you want to... If you want to do it your way... Well, in that case, let's do, like, a fucking big keystone and show the viewers how good we are at this game.
[76:58.81]Show them that it doesn't matter if you click on moves sometimes.
[77:05.38]It doesn't matter.
[77:05.94]You can still clear, like, plus five content.
[77:10.30]What keystone do we have?
[77:11.58]Wait, who... Somebody... What do you mean there's a winner?
[77:13.66]What winner?
[77:16.05]Talix, what are you doing?
[77:17.98]I don't know.
[77:19.22]I just pushed a button.
[77:22.03]Stop telling people they won something.
[77:23.99]I was testing out the plug-in.
[77:27.77]I was just pressing roll the dice to see what happened.
[77:31.21]You're just picking winners?
[77:33.07]Apparently, it automatically writes it in chat.
[77:36.01]Who knew?
[77:36.63]Now I know.
[77:37.13]Okay, well, those people.
[77:38.63]Here's what you guys get.
[77:39.89]Here's what you win.
[77:40.43]You get like a pat on the back.
[77:43.49]He goes, what?
[77:44.23]I won something.
[77:46.42]It's okay.
[77:48.16]One of the guys can't even do it.
[77:51.81]Who else won?
[77:53.69]Alright, we'll invite those two.
[77:56.17]We'll do this first and then... What are we doing first?
[77:59.69]It just rolled out of all 1,100 people in your chat.
[78:03.43]Who won?
[78:05.73]Is Mariah aware that she's going to be on stream?
[78:09.02]I'm aware.
[78:09.68]Okay, so we're on stream right now.
[78:12.10]You're a winner.
[78:12.80]You're a winner.
[78:13.74]Everybody wins.
[78:15.99]Wow, guys, streaming like big mythics.
[78:18.15]This is going to be fun.
[78:20.77]Invite me.
[78:21.35]I'm ready.
[78:22.19]Invite both of them.
[78:25.59]So, are we actually rocking a keystone?
[78:27.92]Yeah.
[78:28.54]Does anybody have one?
[78:29.72]Yeah, we're using Boo's keystone.
[78:30.82]What do you got for a keystone?
[78:31.88]Boo, what's your keystone?
[78:34.36]A 15?
[78:35.00]No, but mine is Call of Stars, and we don't all have that.
[78:37.12]No, we can't do it.
[78:39.02]We literally can't do it.
[78:40.54]Actually, can you do it?
[78:41.44]Can't even do it.
[78:42.95]Where's my... Oh, wait a minute.
[78:43.95]No, wait, that's not till tomorrow.
[78:47.15]Where's my keystone?
[78:47.93]I got Halls of Valor.
[78:52.97]I got plus six Halls of Valor.
[78:55.49]You have plus six?
[78:57.05]We did like plus five last week.
[78:59.35]Let's do that.
[79:01.64]Do you want to do plus six Halls of Valor and I'll die?
[79:05.28]It will not.
[79:06.28]That's kind of tough.
[79:08.16]It will not.
[79:11.22]We have to prove ourselves though, don't we?
[79:13.54]The only thing that'll prove is that we suck.
[79:18.75]Alright, we'll do the plus six.
[79:19.49]Let's do plus four.
[79:19.87]We will not make it on plus six.
[79:20.83]Which plus four?
[79:21.49]What plus four is it?
[79:22.15]Neltharians.
[79:22.91]What?
[79:23.64]What?
[79:25.36]Alright, let's do plus four Neltharians.
[79:26.82]Let's bang that out.
[79:27.76]You know what I mean?
[79:28.28]Might be pronounced layer.
[79:29.42]I'm not sure.
[79:30.52]You got the hottest job ever.
[79:31.58]Oh, it's been Neltharian.
[79:32.76]The three times I've come on to do Mythic five minutes, it's been Neltharians layer now.
[79:36.54]Three times in a row.
[79:37.20]You ready to get some cool shit?
[79:42.04]Fuck.
[79:42.42]Somebody just said, I like how he forgot the stream's gonna die.
[79:45.19]God damn it, you're right.
[79:47.72]Is it actually guaranteed going to die?
[79:51.08]If it's going to die, it's going to die.
[79:54.52]I was having so much fun right now that I forgot that Comcast sucks.
[79:59.65]Hang on, what time does this go down?
[80:01.71]Within the next hour or two.
[80:03.85]Within the next 45 minutes to an hour.
[80:04.85]There's a Comcast employee somewhere just throwing a dart at the board, and instead of a bullseye, it's a power button to germinate.
[80:12.74]How many three-chest mythics can we do in that time period?
[80:15.56]One.
[80:16.80]And it probably will die.
[80:18.34]We're going to wipe at the last boss, lose all of our timer, and then the stream's going to die.
[80:22.74]Oh, no.
[80:24.93]Yeah, I'll explain it.
[80:26.29]I didn't even explain it.
[80:27.77]I explained it when there was only a few hundred people here.
[80:29.54]Let me explain this in full.
[80:30.74]Hey, invite me to the party.
[80:31.70]What's going on here?
[80:32.38]I'm not the leader.
[80:34.44]So, I'm going to mute for this.
[80:38.08]So yeah, Comcast was supposed to fix my internet.
[80:41.45]I was told on Thursday that within 24 to 48 hours, it was going to be fixed.
[80:45.89]And it just did not.
[80:47.75]They told me it's not scheduled until tomorrow afternoon, apparently.
[80:52.73]I don't know why.
[80:53.40]I was told it was going to happen.
[80:54.62]On Monday, it was supposed to be done, which is today.
[80:56.46]No, of course not.
[80:57.32]What did we do last time?
[80:59.04]What plus is that?
[81:00.34]So it's gonna go down, I'm sorry it will.
[81:02.72]I'm gonna go as long as I can.
[81:04.10]And that's what we're doing right now?
[81:06.46]We're doing a four.
[81:07.08]Okay.
[81:08.06]All right.
[81:09.58]Wrist of Shaman works way better if everybody's melee, and we're all melee, except for two of us, which is less than half of the DPS.
[81:17.89]More than half, I mean.
[81:18.93]Okay, we're... Yeah, we're half and half.
[81:22.36]Too many voices.
[81:23.02]Oh, shit, I didn't mute them.
[81:23.94]Oops, sorry.
[81:25.12]I thought I did.
[81:26.12]Idiot, idiot.
[81:27.02]You only muted yourself.
[81:27.76]Will you guys shut up?
[81:29.80]You know what's ironic?
[81:31.60]If you hadn't have muted yourself and we could hear you talk, we wouldn't have spoken and there wouldn't have been any extra voices.
[81:37.60]All right, sorry.
[81:38.20]Okay, everyone, ready?
[81:38.92]Three, two, one, quiet.
[81:40.58]So Comcast was supposed to fix my internet today.
[81:44.50]And they didn't.
[81:45.84]They were supposed to come out here.
[81:46.92]They did not.
[81:47.72]I was told on Thursday that they were going to fix it.
[81:50.14]No, they didn't.
[81:52.65]I can't, I fucking can't help myself.
[81:53.93]I can't help myself.
[81:54.71]I don't know what I'm doing.
[81:55.41]Stop.
[81:55.87]Stop doing that.
[81:56.55]Stop it.
[81:58.67]Okay, I'm fine.
[81:59.03]That was a funny point attack that you made.
[82:03.27]It's true.
[82:04.33]What'd you do?
[82:06.05]His point about how you wanting, you know, to talk to the stream privately and mute so you could get a serious point across.
[82:14.55]You muting.
[82:15.17]Well, I hit the wrong button.
[82:16.44]I have two buttons.
[82:17.10]I made it more loud.
[82:18.20]I can deafen and mute.
[82:20.14]I hit the wrong button.
[82:24.05]Why don't you hit both buttons?
[82:25.51]Mages portals to all the zones if you it's a class all upgrade thing that's like over power My mage you know what I get pretty I get like 10% like versatility buffs while I'm in the broken Isles and That goes away when I do a dungeon cool Like a shaman bonus look at the three two one.
[82:47.45]I'm too scared to use it.
[82:48.35]It's too precious.
[82:49.01]Oh
[82:50.88]Thanks a lot Snag for your new subscription.
[82:53.64]Thanks Morty Ragey for eight months.
[82:55.74]Seems like it only applies in the least important content.
[82:59.68]True, but that's where I spend most of my time pretty much.
[83:02.26]I can roll around the entire Broken Isles.
[83:03.92]There's infinite charges.
[83:05.08]Why wouldn't... Jacko, are you purposely going the wrong way?
[83:07.24]I see you running in circles.
[83:08.40]I was talking to... Am I muted right now?
[83:10.64]Why are you scared to use it?
[83:11.68]Do you think it's going to disappear?
[83:13.72]I was talking to Chad and when I talk to Chad I walk in circles.
[83:16.21]You know that.
[83:17.35]Maybe it lasts like an hour.
[83:19.19]Oh.
[83:20.01]But infinite charges.
[83:22.18]Infinite charges.
[83:22.94]Just roll everywhere.
[83:23.86]And I remember when you told your stream about, or your YouTube video about how there's like water in your basement and you're playing Minecraft, building walls, destroying the walls.
[83:32.16]Yeah.
[83:33.12]And good stuff.
[83:35.47]Yeah.
[83:38.17]Yeah.
[83:39.03]I'm here.
[83:39.57]I'm here at Neltharion's.
[83:40.57]Say hi to him for me.
[83:44.21]This isn't Tuesday.
[83:45.09]No, it's not Tuesday.
[83:47.09]Why do I have invisibility?
[83:48.12]What the hell is that?
[83:50.48]Have aggro.
[83:53.16]Boo, help me.
[83:54.58]Boo, save me, quick.
[83:56.50]What's wrong?
[83:57.02]I have a bunch of alligators on me.
[83:59.26]Oh, I thought you were getting attacked by a horde.
[84:01.23]No, I knew you would save me.
[84:05.35]They're gonna stun me.
[84:10.15]Right before he got in.
[84:13.83]He like jumped.
[84:14.49]He was doing the I'm gonna jump it.
[84:16.45]Now he's gonna freak out.
[84:18.73]Hey.
[84:19.09]Hey.
[84:19.97]Don't do that to me.
[84:20.64]Do I need to change specs so I can turn him into a sheep?
[84:26.72]No.
[84:27.16]Just go in.
[84:28.52]Well, we have to summon.
[84:30.66]Hold on.
[84:30.94]I'm a different spec now.
[84:32.98]Like, go in.
[84:33.72]Get in.
[84:33.94]He's immune!
[84:34.94]And I can't do that for 30 seconds.
[84:38.85]Why is Polymorph way more OP?
[84:40.19]What's he doing?
[84:40.71]What the hell?
[84:41.81]Hey, Boo, do you have water?
[84:43.71]Give me your water mount so I can get mana.
[84:45.19]Go in!
[84:46.57]He's a mage!
[84:48.71]Oh, yeah.
[84:51.67]You... He is a mage.
[84:53.20]Go in.
[84:53.70]There!
[84:56.66]Thurma's ordering the horde around.
[84:57.94]Maybe he's waiting for someone.
[85:00.22]Alright, here.
[85:01.22]This is if you want to place a table.
[85:06.26]Call that a table?
[85:07.00]Boo, can I have your big, wonderful, annoying scream thing?
[85:12.44]Oh, no, you don't have a scream thing.
[85:13.70]Did you call it annoying?
[85:15.38]I'm taking it down.
[85:16.20]No, it's not the screamer, right?
[85:19.57]Oh, no.
[85:21.33]This is a nice, happy Vendement.
[85:23.73]Oh.
[85:27.89]I don't know why I got, like, a hundred mana fritters.
[85:32.13]I really just wanted to make sure I didn't run out.
[85:34.15]I'm going to use all hundred of them.
[85:36.45]Alright, log out again.
[85:37.13]Do you remember spending all this money on a funny joke transmog?
[85:43.65]Hey, look at this funny joke transmog.
[86:03.04]Good one.
[86:05.11]Hang on, I gotta zoom in.
[86:05.77]Hey, who's shitting your cereal this morning?
[86:10.62]Let me zoom in so I can see it.
[86:14.56]I'm trying to, like... I'm trying out a new, like, deadpan humor joke.
[86:18.60]I like the purple pajamas the best.
[86:20.65]Alright, make sure it's on Mythic.
[86:31.77]Hey, somebody said Zatman in your chat.
[86:34.00]Uh...
[86:35.77]I don't like that.
[86:37.65]I might have just started a fight.
[86:38.69]We should probably go in.
[86:41.26]Okay.
[86:41.98]Ready?
[86:43.16]It is set to mythic.
[86:45.56]I was looking forward to a nice horde brawl right there.
[86:48.48]That's a nice joke transmog.
[86:50.26]Yeah, it's a good joke.
[86:54.01]Alright, so from now on, ladies and gentlemen, I have to concentrate.
[87:00.89]I'm not going to look at everyone making fun of me.
[87:03.92]I'm going to play the game.
[87:05.42]We have to try hard here.
[87:07.34]There will be no chat interaction from this point on.
[87:09.60]There will be no interaction for the next 26 minutes.
[87:13.08]33 minutes.
[87:14.96]That's how long it will take us.
[87:18.82]Alright, you guys ready?
[87:20.12]I am ready.
[87:20.84]Oh boy.
[87:21.82]What's the, uh... What is it?
[87:24.58]Raging.
[87:25.50]When someone... When a mob gets to 30% health, we have to focus it down.
[87:29.52]It's double damage, so... Oh fuck, I fell!
[87:32.82]Execute him.
[87:33.48]I thought... I ruined it.
[87:34.74]I fell.
[87:37.44]Everything is ruined.
[87:40.96]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[87:43.52]Oh, here we go.
[87:45.57]Let's do it.
[87:48.49]What's the, like, specification here?
[87:51.13]Raging.
[87:52.13]Once they get below 30% health, they do double damage.
[88:01.68]Die!
[88:02.68]Alex, let me know when it's like, hey, my name is Alex and I'm about to die.
[88:05.78]Do I say it just like that?
[88:07.64]Do the quicker version of that.
[88:12.52]Just when I say, hey, my name's Vitalix, that's your cue.
[88:15.08]Just scream as loud as you can.
[88:16.58]Then, and only then will I know you're in danger.
[88:21.67]Oh god, I don't know why that keeps happening.
[88:25.97]Is Brett's mic talking to you or is it just me?
[88:29.43]Uh oh.
[88:29.57]This is an awful time for that.
[88:31.11]It's always like that.
[88:36.33]Oh, I don't want to sit in the acid.
[88:38.01]Somebody slash pause.
[88:40.43]I can fix that.
[88:44.34]Kidding, we're screwed.
[89:04.93]And then the stream dies.
[89:05.99]Oh, that would be so horrible.
[89:11.17]Here we go.
[89:11.55]Here we go.
[89:11.93]Alright, what is it?
[89:13.39]I just have to point him away?
[89:14.35]Yeah, just face this guy.
[89:15.95]Okay.
[89:17.61]Stupid crabs.
[89:21.01]Make sure you stand inside blue circle.
[89:22.77]It heals you.
[89:24.27]I gotta face him away, you know?
[89:26.05]My name's Alex.
[89:28.12]Oh lord.
[89:30.88]I need some heals.
[89:32.96]I'm stunning.
[89:39.39]Oh, 12 stacks of spinning crane kick.
[89:40.91]Hmm.
[89:48.06]Die!
[89:50.22]Oh my gosh.
[89:51.50]That was painful.
[89:52.66]Whoa!
[89:53.40]He's almost dead.
[89:54.16]Just finish him.
[89:55.34]Don't release.
[89:56.84]I'm not.
[89:57.52]Somebody else risen.
[89:58.50]Well, I mean, healing everybody.
[90:00.36]Come on, combat.
[90:00.88]There we go.
[90:01.24]Can we get some failfish when they wipe?
[90:06.01]Don't jinx us.
[90:10.88]The angrier we make Jerma, the better he does.
[90:16.32]I don't know if that's true.
[90:19.48]I have performance anxiety when I play.
[90:29.77]Click, click, click, click, click, click.
[90:31.69]It's just a bunch of clicking.
[90:34.57]Don't you talk about me, the master clicker.
[90:44.74]I know what I should have done.
[90:45.60]Whipped out the old skull macro.
[90:48.84]I can mark.
[90:51.65]I don't know if I want to do that.
[90:57.45]Is that twice as hard as this?
[90:59.47]There's a third effect that comes out at 10 that I've not played with before.
[91:05.32]third effects?
[91:06.86]What?
[91:07.44]What?
[91:08.20]What?
[91:08.79]What?
[91:08.97]What?
[91:09.47]What?
[91:11.35]What?
[91:12.71]Watch the stream!
[91:14.97]I gave you water walking.
[91:15.91]Oh, why did you do that?
[91:18.13]Because it would kill you and be funny.
[91:20.61]Oh my god, is that a fucking heart attack?
[91:23.66]No, and I don't have any arcane charges.
[91:25.68]I'm going to be so useless.
[91:29.58]So mean.
[91:30.10]Plus full.
[91:30.88]Oh, what the fuck?
[91:32.30]Are we ready?
[91:32.70]I have zero arcane charges!
[91:34.54]Let's go.
[91:36.04]Oh god damn it!
[91:39.04]Why?
[91:41.82]Why did you do this to me?
[91:44.91]He's like more mad than amused.
[91:47.65]I was very- I was about to call Blizzard.
[91:53.09]I was gonna get on the fucking phone.
[91:56.51]And be like, what happened?
[91:59.91]Blizzard, this is my keystone dungeon.
[92:10.34]God, my brain hurts now.
[92:14.84]Every class has at least one dangerous thing for you to muck about with.
[92:18.22]I know, seriously.
[92:19.00]That's what you get for clicking.
[92:23.18]This guy is like the best DPS for me because I can just stand still.
[92:32.41]And I got ruined.
[92:41.88]I'm just gonna click now, just to make people angry.
[92:48.05]Gosh, why is the Shaman so good if everyone's standing on top of each other?
[92:52.13]But that's not the case.
[92:58.88]Rewind to Flanker.
[93:01.49]My favorite part is how confident you were that it was Blizzard's fault.
[93:05.39]Watch the stream!
[93:06.53]Watch it!
[93:06.91]You'll see.
[93:07.89]You'll see proof that I'm not crazy.
[93:09.69]I fucking hit the water dude and was just like upset.
[93:12.44]I couldn't believe it.
[93:13.42]I couldn't fucking believe it dude.
[93:23.83]Alright Boo heal everybody.
[93:26.09]I gotta get mana.
[93:29.13]Wait, what?
[93:32.01]I wish I could do this infinitely.
[93:33.13]I can do, like, five before I'm energy-stunned.
[93:35.37]Alright, I'm going in the hobbit barrel.
[93:39.68]Hey, thanks, Willy Dick.
[93:41.28]Yeah, I blame you for at least 15k there.
[93:55.51]Thanks breakfast- breakfast-o-mancer!
[93:57.01]Alright, we're supposed to go right or left here?
[93:58.47]Right.
[93:59.83]We can skip this first, go ahead.
[94:01.89]Okay.
[94:02.65]Just hug the wall.
[94:05.09]See how- It would've been worse if I was a frost death knight and I was standing in the water with water walking on.
[94:13.12]And just waiting for everybody to drop like ants.
[94:15.48]Or flies, or whatever drops.
[94:18.36]I truly believed that like, something went horribly wrong.
[94:22.82]Come quick so we can get past this patrol.
[94:25.68]Stupid kitty may get caught.
[94:29.92]That should be good.
[94:30.82]That should be fun.
[94:33.30]Alright, this is where it gets rough.
[94:36.73]Probably focus the pelters.
[94:38.45]Life is rough.
[94:40.11]Mana management.
[94:41.91]Ready?
[94:42.09]Just go.
[94:42.47]It is annoying.
[94:43.99]Everybody try to stand in melee range.
[94:45.79]It will make us be alive more.
[94:47.87]Be melee hunter and be melee arcane mage for this fight.
[94:50.53]That's what I'm going to do.
[94:52.55]Oh, they jumped in the same place.
[94:53.71]That's really good.
[94:54.91]Ow.
[95:03.68]The more melee we are, the better.
[95:05.12]So keep it up.
[95:10.70]Unless those rockfalls, like, stack.
[95:13.21]I don't know if they do.
[95:14.61]That would be terrible.
[95:16.69]No.
[95:17.51]I don't think they do.
[95:18.67]It would be so bad.
[95:24.66]Why is there a Velociraptor in the squad?
[95:26.60]That is true.
[95:29.66]There's a guy that's just randomly behind us.
[95:31.16]What is he doing here?
[95:31.68]What's this dude here?
[95:32.84]Oh.
[95:33.48]Oh, crap.
[95:34.72]Oh, crap.
[95:35.12]We'll be fine.
[95:35.80]I'm popping all my buttons.
[95:38.38]Everybody stay in the melee range.
[95:45.90]Focused on the Blightshot, guys.
[95:47.12]He's almost dead.
[95:50.10]Actually, the Hulk is... The Hulk.
[95:54.03]Hulk's the Hulk?
[95:55.87]I'm stunned.
[95:57.11]And some big chain heals.
[95:57.89]Oh, I'm stunned.
[95:58.33]Help me.
[95:58.81]Ah, ah, ah.
[96:00.79]I'm out.
[96:02.99]Oh my gosh, damage.
[96:08.76]I think this is the guy I paralyzed earlier, but some of my walkthrough.
[96:11.50]Oh, whoopsie.
[96:13.48]We did it.
[96:14.60]More dots, more dots, more dots.
[96:16.20]All right, we'll heal everybody.
[96:18.02]I'll get mana.
[96:18.60]I really do need to buy a net.
[96:21.14]We're going to one-chest it.
[96:22.79]Everyone made fun of me so much.
[96:24.13]Don't we always?
[96:26.72]No, me and Boo two-chested our plus four last time.
[96:31.97]I've never been with you with more than one chest.
[96:35.17]We got a three-chest on you today.
[96:36.41]Can I pull these two or the guy wait for them and get the two on the left?
[96:40.93]Probably just wait, actually.
[96:42.11]Come on, Boo, this is on a stream.
[96:46.51]I know.
[96:46.83]We need to show everybody that we're cool people.
[96:50.00]All right, pull them.
[96:52.18]I did that last time.
[96:53.74]Don't tip me again.
[96:58.33]Because it's always this place where that joke gets made.
[97:01.73]Yeah, I don't know why that is true.
[97:03.57]I mean, if there's a time to show off, it's now, right?
[97:06.25]Kill big guy, kill big guy.
[97:11.97]Actually, this pool was probably okay because there's none of those pelters in this group.
[97:17.69]But up there, there's two.
[97:18.77]Their kind is weak to ice and fireballs.
[97:20.41]Is the shaper ranged or no?
[97:24.15]I think so.
[97:25.45]Okay.
[97:25.99]Let's get a little closer.
[97:28.67]What, you play much Resto Shaman lately?
[97:31.09]None at all.
[97:31.93]Haven't touched it.
[97:33.63]I haven't played the Shaman in like a week.
[97:35.87]A week?
[97:40.22]He's only 104.
[97:40.60]Is he really?
[97:41.82]I think I stood in Petrifying Totem.
[97:48.52]I don't think standing with it does anything.
[97:50.70]Good.
[97:50.94]Ah, it's done.
[97:56.43]Get him out!
[98:01.18]Do I pull the shaper already?
[98:02.30]Sure.
[98:02.50]Kill that burning Geodude next.
[98:03.54]Pretty weak.
[98:04.28]Kill Geodude next.
[98:04.72]Oh, nice Geodude!
[98:05.06]Down!
[98:32.08]Do you want me to hero this guy?
[98:32.74]I think it's you, dude.
[98:34.35]Will the new Pokemon come out soon?
[98:36.03]Should we hero this guy?
[98:36.75]Oh, we have two hero classes.
[98:38.39]We probably should have heroed him in the first pass.
[98:40.29]Yeah, I just realized that.
[98:42.07]I think we were too busy laughing at me screaming.
[98:44.95]Yeah.
[98:46.62]Ah!
[98:47.58]Let him die.
[98:48.12]I don't know why you're getting stunned.
[98:50.52]I don't know how that thing works.
[98:56.66]Shelters.
[99:03.40]Peltor.
[99:04.52]One in the middle.
[99:05.77]Ooh.
[99:05.85]Oh my gosh.
[99:08.35]I'm going to stand here.
[99:09.45]Everybody stand inside this ring.
[99:15.25]Ooh.
[99:15.41]Ooh.
[99:16.61]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[99:20.19]Ooh is right.
[99:22.87]This dungeon is heal a check.
[99:25.91]Hey, don't be mean to me.
[99:27.74]No, I'm not.
[99:28.92]No, no.
[99:29.76]I'm doing a sick job.
[99:30.99]Look at me go.
[99:31.57]Yeah, you are.
[99:32.49]Look at him go.
[99:33.11]Wait, you're actually doing like 270k.
[99:34.65]God damn.
[99:35.55]God damn, this guy fucking hates me.
[99:42.64]Death Knight's probably really good for this dungeon, just for those guys.
[99:45.58]Alright, top everybody off.
[99:47.08]Ready?
[99:47.74]Everyone needs to be topped off.
[99:49.92]I guess just yourself off.
[99:50.94]Look at all these mana users.
[99:52.89]Ready?
[99:53.61]It's so useless.
[99:54.89]Sorry, both me and Jerma have to stop playing.
[99:57.73]After every pull, we both have to stop playing the game.
[100:02.11]Yeah, we're ready.
[100:05.03]Oh, this is gonna be a healer check, this guy.
[100:10.67]Yeah.
[100:11.25]And my two-minute cooldowns have been popped, and I do not have them.
[100:16.09]It's okay, that's why I'm a secondary healer.
[100:23.13]High mountain itself rises against you.
[100:27.02]High mountain itself rises against you.
[100:31.68]High mountain will be your tomb.
[100:36.16]If we fail, this will be the worst place ever.
[100:37.70]We can't screw this up.
[100:38.62]Okay, we can't screw it up.
[100:39.48]I blinked.
[100:41.56]Got it still.
[100:42.54]I got it, I got it.
[100:43.68]I got it still.
[100:44.22]It's right there.
[100:44.60]It's that one.
[100:45.49]See it?
[100:47.51]I don't know.
[100:49.23]I don't know.
[100:49.87]Boo's on it.
[100:50.31]Boo's on it.
[100:52.79]Everybody stay in melee range.
[100:54.47]I don't know.
[100:58.37]Al, please kill Tim.
[100:59.03]Should we hero now?
[100:59.81]Boo.
[101:01.37]Al, please kill Tim.
[101:02.19]Should we hero now?
[101:05.00]Sure, whatever.
[101:05.80]One second!
[101:06.20]Oh yeah!
[101:06.50]Well, it didn't even work.
[101:08.54]I got it.
[101:09.22]Me!
[101:09.66]Me!
[101:10.50]It's really shitty.
[101:11.16]I'm not pressing it.
[101:12.12]Do it!
[101:12.58]Everything you got!
[101:13.32]I'm not doing good.
[101:15.14]Everything you got!
[101:31.06]Come on.
[101:31.68]Give it to him.
[101:33.32]Oh.
[102:01.91]Feel good.
[102:02.79]I got it.
[102:03.13]I got it.
[102:05.93]It's this stray one.
[102:09.27]Zero again.
[102:11.41]Melee range.
[102:12.11]Zero again.
[102:14.41]In the same fight.
[102:28.20]Kill him now.
[102:29.20]Kill him now.
[102:35.28]This is what it feels like.
[102:37.02]How many chests do we get for that?
[102:38.24]Three.
[102:38.58]Three per boss.
[102:40.15]Three by two chests.
[102:43.19]Jeremy, my mom said it was okay if you come spend the night.
[102:47.37]What?
[102:49.03]He's got a little blanket fort.
[102:50.87]It's alright.
[102:52.59]My mom said you can come spend the night.
[102:55.02]You gonna play PlayStation 2?
[102:58.44]Alright, damn it.
[103:00.16]3.
[103:01.12]Your mom won't let you play it, but my mom will.
[103:03.14]Mother.
[103:07.42]We're just gonna get these two dickheads or we're gonna be good here?
[103:11.86]What?
[103:12.64]Is that a challenge?
[103:14.38]The guy's behind us.
[103:15.80]Oh my god.
[103:17.21]What did he do?
[103:18.35]Woo!
[103:20.23]He said, are we gonna be a chump here?
[103:21.67]So I thought we were taking it easy.
[103:23.19]I was making a joke.
[103:25.21]Oh.
[103:25.75]It was a joke for people to say, whoa.
[103:27.03]I thought you were being for reals.
[103:33.37]Oh boy, I'm gonna die.
[103:34.97]I'm standing in bad stuff.
[103:36.09]Don't stand in the green.
[103:39.76]I'm in the green.
[103:40.40]I've been in the green for at least a minute.
[103:42.64]One mob left.
[103:43.10]I'm just going to release because it's not even that far.
[103:47.32]Green is bad.
[103:47.96]Did I not catch that?
[103:49.58]Fuck, I don't think I did.
[103:56.02]Trying.
[103:57.16]How did you die?
[103:57.84]The thing he throws at you?
[104:01.22]I can heal you.
[104:02.24]Resurrect.
[104:02.62]Come on, we have to get two chests.
[104:03.60]Two chests.
[104:08.38]See, I thought this was a Mythic plus six group, but apparently it's a plus one group.
[104:15.01]Actually, it's plus four.
[104:15.57]This is only plus four.
[104:16.29]This is plus four, man.
[104:19.23]With ravaging.
[104:20.41]Group, not dungeon.
[104:22.11]We are pretty much Mythic one.
[104:24.30]Oh, no.
[104:24.96]Mythic one.
[104:25.70]I think we can pull those.
[104:27.64]They're all weaklings.
[104:29.68]We have no choice.
[104:30.34]Why did you do that?
[104:32.16]I didn't pull them, but I stunned them.
[104:36.64]Yeah, they're all wibs.
[104:38.06]If they weren't stunned, I wouldn't have died.
[104:39.66]Kill it.
[104:40.28]Kill the wib.
[104:41.40]Back here.
[104:42.60]There's a wib.
[104:43.24]Oh, shit.
[104:43.62]Wib.
[104:44.50]Nah, it's gonna get up.
[104:47.84]I don't know what these things even do.
[104:49.06]They usually die.
[104:55.49]High mountain itself rises against you.
[105:01.41]Don't pull yet.
[105:03.42]Yes, definitely don't pull yet.
[105:04.94]This is the drink group right here.
[105:08.92]Yeah, we really are a bunch of drunks, huh?
[105:12.04]Okay, I'm great.
[105:13.86]We can pull whenever.
[105:15.61]Three, two, one, go.
[105:18.51]Wanna tell you to run, Talix?
[105:19.43]You gotta run for your life.
[105:25.41]I vaguely remember.
[105:26.25]Alright.
[105:29.00]Everybody was coming back guys.
[105:33.38]My pet won't attack him.
[105:35.60]Oh.
[105:36.76]Did you revive your pets?
[105:38.00]Yeah.
[105:43.75]Since he's out of range.
[105:45.05]Oh, he got him.
[105:45.53]That's strange.
[105:46.09]All right.
[105:46.41]Okay, hold on.
[105:48.01]Where are your pets?
[105:50.03]His damage only got up by 50%.
[105:51.37]He's just standing back there.
[105:52.39]Your pets are standing behind you not doing anything.
[105:54.03]Yeah, he won't do anything.
[105:56.38]How do you fix the broken pit?
[105:59.06]I'm just gonna recall him.
[106:01.86]Now he wants to go.
[106:03.07]What needs to be interrupted with this guy?
[106:05.33]Anything?
[106:06.53]Nothing.
[106:07.61]Interrupt him.
[106:09.31]Ow, where am I?
[106:09.77]Oh gosh.
[106:11.75]Oh gosh.
[106:12.53]Run.
[106:14.99]I know Alaneth.
[106:15.71]I know I need more mana.
[106:16.53]Are you serious?
[106:23.97]He's pulling me with his spider webs.
[106:25.61]What's he doing to you?
[106:26.25]He's, like, drinking you.
[106:28.76]Don't eat him.
[106:41.03]Ay-yup!
[106:43.91]That guy's... They can't be slowed.
[106:50.00]Mmm-yup!
[106:54.36]I'm gonna get out of mana.
[106:55.24]Yeah, this is a pretty hideous healer fight.
[107:00.14]Fuck.
[107:04.55]Everybody stand in this green circle that you see on the ground.
[107:06.91]There's so much green.
[107:07.99]The green that I made.
[107:09.55]The happy green circle.
[107:11.95]Oh, it's gone.
[107:12.35]I have no mana left.
[107:16.73]You have no mana left?
[107:17.57]How much health does this guy have?
[107:19.36]You don't have any mana left?
[107:21.45]He still has nine million health and I'm dead.
[107:23.49]Oh my gosh.
[107:24.43]Stay alive!
[107:28.21]I got this!
[107:30.52]I got it!
[107:33.54]Everything you got!
[107:35.30]Five million, you might actually do it.
[107:36.72]Come on, you motherfucker!
[107:39.32]Two million!
[107:40.61]Oh my gosh.
[107:43.04]1.8 million.
[107:43.84]How are you still alive?
[107:44.72]Keep me alive!
[107:45.88]I reincarnated just to heal you a little.
[107:48.44]1.5 million.
[107:48.82]He's got 1.5, though.
[107:49.36]1.6.
[107:49.38]Come on, you son of a bitch!
[107:50.58]1.2.
[107:50.60]1 million.
[107:50.80]How are you alive?
[107:51.26]Come on!
[107:52.42]I'm the fucking master of World of Warcraft!
[107:55.62]Yes!
[107:56.26]Oh my gosh.
[107:56.62]Release.
[107:57.16]Oh, we're so far away.
[107:58.50]How did you survive?
[108:12.34]We were struggling with a healer and you're the only one left and you lived!
[108:16.16]What the fuck?
[108:19.42]What am I doing?
[108:21.09]Are we out running back?
[108:22.13]Yeah, we are.
[108:23.31]I mean, it's too late for you, just stay there.
[108:25.03]Oh, it's too late now.
[108:28.99]Unbelievable.
[108:29.97]This'll be the worst one-chest ever.
[108:34.49]Yeah.
[108:38.35]I don't know how the fuck I stayed alive.
[108:40.94]I have no idea.
[108:44.84]I was like clicking on moves and shit.
[108:47.33]You don't ever like roll out the clicker.
[108:56.15]I thought you were gonna water walk me for a second.
[109:00.03]That would just be salt in the wound.
[109:01.59]Like he survives and then you kill him.
[109:06.04]The only thing that could defeat him was not the rexus, the boss.
[109:09.97]It was actually Dugas the guy meant to keep him alive.
[109:12.57]Who needs enemies?
[109:13.71]Who needs more than one chest?
[109:18.10]Hey, one chest is all it takes to get a fucking legendary.
[109:20.46]That's true.
[109:22.86]Alright, we're ready.
[109:24.32]No, we're not.
[109:26.58]These guys interrupt Scorpion dude, right?
[109:29.56]He can interrupt you, but pop him up when he tries to cast... Burped in my mouth.
[109:34.02]Now we're ready.
[109:35.92]3, 2, 1, go.
[109:36.90]How did he survive?
[109:39.72]How did you take no damage?
[109:41.20]I ice blocked when he did his dumb move.
[109:44.63]And then I had other stuff.
[109:48.23]You were standing on my way, right?
[109:49.37]So you're not in melee range.
[109:50.53]Oh, God.
[109:50.99]You're not in melee range.
[109:52.73]What does he do when no one's in melee?
[109:54.59]I figured he would just do some crazy spit thing that would instakill you.
[109:58.62]I think I ice blocked it.
[110:00.08]He tried to do it.
[110:01.36]And then he just kind of stood around for a second long enough for me to not die.
[110:04.50]Are we?
[110:06.63]Careful.
[110:09.10]Alright, face this scorpion away from us.
[110:10.90]Alright, this guy was planning on it.
[110:13.02]On the left.
[110:13.56]Boo, you wanna get the first one, and I'll get the second one?
[110:16.57]Yeah, I think he'll only do it once.
[110:18.31]Well, you get the first one, just in case.
[110:20.31]Yep.
[110:22.53]Actually, mine's a stun.
[110:23.99]It's better.
[110:24.33]You use supernova, if you can.
[110:25.90]First one, when he does it?
[110:27.06]Okay.
[110:27.64]Yeah.
[110:28.88]Stun's more useful for the second mobs.
[110:33.24]He popped.
[110:37.57]He's enraged.
[110:38.62]Oh boy, double damage.
[110:44.30]That's one scorpion!
[110:45.50]It's so hard to keep people alive.
[110:47.70]Are we going to get the enemy forces?
[110:50.02]I'm out of mana, hold on.
[110:51.38]I think we can run back up if we don't, right?
[110:54.60]Well, let me test.
[110:56.13]Oh god.
[110:57.09]There's three chumps right here that we can kill.
[110:59.55]We'll have enough people.
[111:01.03]We'll top everybody off.
[111:02.69]We will be fine.
[111:04.11]Want to top me off?
[111:06.48]Thank you.
[111:07.18]I say focus the Scorpion because Jesus.
[111:11.30]I'll get the knockup first.
[111:13.90]Oh, and don't pull Dargles.
[111:17.58]That'd be pretty bad.
[111:18.24]Don't pull Dargle.
[111:22.56]Oh, he hit me hard.
[111:23.58]Rip them apart!
[111:28.36]I'm stunned.
[111:29.82]How did he stun you?
[111:32.95]Ooh, it hurts.
[111:34.07]It hurts a lot.
[111:35.85]I might have to ice block here.
[111:37.46]Crap.
[111:37.76]Uh-oh.
[111:40.14]Turtle.
[111:41.78]Turtle, turtle.
[111:49.89]Okay, so that can be interrupted.
[111:51.25]That's the stun move.
[111:52.39]Is that what that was?
[111:53.11]Yeah, I just... Found, yeah.
[111:56.31]Got a mana.
[111:56.79]Nervous laugh.
[112:03.14]I do a lot of those in these dungeons.
[112:06.36]Alright, I'm good.
[112:07.66]We may have to pull some trash up.
[112:08.68]Yeah, we will have to pull a bit of trash up there.
[112:13.47]But we'll get them later.
[112:20.73]Yeah, maybe we'll get one chest.
[112:23.98]Yeah, one chest.
[112:25.14]It's good enough for me.
[112:29.86]Ooh, that hurts.
[112:30.88]Oh boy.
[112:33.60]Oh boy, ow ow ow ow ow.
[112:34.52]Ow ow ow ow ow ow.
[112:37.25]I was trying to just fish for an Arcane Missiles there, I didn't get one.
[112:45.57]What the fuck?
[112:47.85]350k and we're still just in so much pain.
[112:50.11]I know!
[112:53.63]Do you imagine, do you imagine, do you know the next fix this week at plus seven is necrotic, meaning we take less healing.
[113:01.62]Yeah, flipping Orion.
[113:04.02]You ready to smash this guy?
[113:06.82]No.
[113:07.40]I'm already here.
[113:09.49]I'm already there.
[113:10.95]Oh, you're already there.
[113:11.65]I'm already there.
[113:13.59]Hopefully just these guys will do it and not the scorpion.
[113:16.85]Okie dokie.
[113:19.93]How bad can might stone breakers be?
[113:21.45]I don't know what these losers do.
[113:24.65]Who knows?
[113:26.67]One on the left first.
[113:30.41]Who's left?
[113:31.46]Just kidding.
[113:31.94]I know.
[113:35.32]Derm is short.
[113:35.90]No, I'm not.
[113:37.42]I'm 5'8".
[113:40.34]Like, I look over and just like, see them.
[113:42.06]That's the only comment you've seen in your life.
[113:44.05]That's the only comment I've seen.
[113:44.81]That's the only chat interaction we've had also.
[113:46.29]Yeah, that's, there's your, hope you enjoy your chat interaction.
[113:48.63]They didn't count.
[113:49.13]Why did they not count?
[113:49.97]I guess they're fake mobs.
[113:52.19]Fuck, are we gonna get a chest here?
[113:54.07]Come on.
[113:54.57]Five minutes.
[113:58.29]Oh, boy.
[113:58.95]Are we gonna get a chest here?
[114:01.71]I mean, come on.
[114:10.94]Bounce him!
[114:12.32]He got bounced.
[114:12.90]Do you target that or does it just go underneath him while I'm targeting?
[114:18.56]It's whoever I'm targeting.
[114:19.34]It just blows up underneath.
[114:20.20]Oh, okay.
[114:21.39]If I don't have any targets, it just goes right underneath me.
[114:24.65]Hopefully this guy's worth exactly 7% to them.
[114:26.63]That would be lovely.
[114:27.85]Hopefully he's at any percent.
[114:29.85]He might be none again.
[114:31.61]Are we fucked?
[114:35.02]Let me through!
[114:35.96]Don't you know who I am?
[114:37.12]We can climb up the other way.
[114:38.68]Holy moly.
[114:41.41]With a bit of work, we can hop up here.
[114:43.62]I don't think we've ever done this.
[114:44.60]I don't think we've ever not done this.
[114:48.30]We should have pulled the guys by the snails.
[114:50.46]We walked through so many people at the beginning, I think.
[114:52.95]Yeah, if we got the snail racers, we would have done it.
[114:56.71]We didn't even do the snail race.
[114:58.31]Freaking snail racers.
[115:05.92]Rip them apart!
[115:15.53]Hopefully these guys are worth, you know, kills.
[115:18.01]3%.
[115:18.03]No, I don't think they are.
[115:20.39]All we need.
[115:22.77]That guy didn't give us nothing.
[115:25.92]Heard one.
[115:26.84]Nothing.
[115:27.68]Focus on your dungeon, please.
[115:29.86]Oh my god, 99.
[115:30.88]Please, god.
[115:31.72]Oh, Jesus.
[115:33.72]Let's go kill this hammer-wielding son of a bitch.
[115:35.90]They were worth half a percentage.
[115:38.37]Let me stop playing the game for a sec.
[115:40.33]Alright, so are you ready to do a...
[115:44.17]No.
[115:44.45]You're gonna do it?
[115:45.35]I'm gonna do it.
[115:46.61]I'm not gonna do it.
[115:47.47]You do it.
[115:47.83]I did it first time.
[115:48.51]You do it this time.
[115:49.55]Why?
[115:50.24]We have three, but it's 50!
[115:51.08]I feel like you use it.
[115:52.84]Go.
[115:53.28]Ready?
[115:53.48]Go!
[115:53.66]Do it!
[115:54.88]It costs 47,000 mana to do.
[115:56.12]Wait, did you already pop it?
[115:58.78]I just did.
[116:00.00]Oh.
[116:02.20]Kill this motherfucker.
[116:06.56]Kill that motherfucker first.
[116:14.81]Are we going to wipe on this guy?
[116:16.05]Is he going to do so much damage that I can't heal?
[116:18.01]No, he doesn't do much damage.
[116:20.65]As long as we actually have the thing to hide behind.
[116:39.22]He countered a knockback with double jump.
[116:42.59]I just opened my wings, my wonderful wings.
[116:45.27]That's really good.
[116:45.95]He's gonna do it here in a second.
[116:51.01]In ten.
[116:53.59]Holy smokes.
[116:56.96]Go behind those spikes.
[116:59.20]They go on my stacks.
[117:00.78]Shit.
[117:01.42]Everybody come, not die.
[117:02.24]Oh, I'm stuck.
[117:04.48]What am I stuck on?
[117:08.10]What was I stuck on?
[117:11.86]All right, kill him.
[117:15.11]What's his health?
[117:16.61]Pretty low.
[117:19.81]30%.
[117:19.83]We do have to kill that guy.
[117:27.13]The mountain will gnaw on your bones!
[117:31.54]Oh, he's focused on me.
[117:32.28]Okay, I'm just gonna calm him.
[117:38.96]Burn him!
[117:42.64]You should die before the next... ouchy phase.
[117:50.76]Oh yeah, we're gonna one-chest him.
[117:52.69]He's ouchy phasing in, uh, six seconds, guys.
[117:55.81]Kill him.
[117:56.13]Kill him!
[117:58.33]Kill him!
[117:59.13]Kill ouchy.
[117:59.85]Kill him!
[118:00.19]We're not gonna kill him.
[118:01.93]Oh yeah!
[118:02.27]Oh yeah!
[118:04.99]He's dead.
[118:05.35]Oh, we did.
[118:07.48]That's an upgrade.
[118:09.08]Oh, we did in the time limit?
[118:11.13]I just did like a bunch of like moves to a bunch of people around me in my room no one has 60 oh that's really good
[118:35.71]But I lose 860.
[118:36.81]I lose mastery and crit.
[118:38.45]I don't know.
[118:39.07]Where do you see your keystone?
[118:41.65]In your bags.
[118:42.07]Somewhere.
[118:42.35]In your bagpacks.
[118:42.91]I lose by two main stats.
[118:45.02]There it is.
[118:46.54]I lose crit and mastery.
[118:48.28]Haste is worthless to me.
[119:07.06]Well, we got through the dungeon before you, you know, conked out and DZ'd.
[119:10.20]Yeah, what time is it right now?
[119:13.70]It's like 8.40?
[119:14.14]It's like 1.50.
[119:18.27]Better say your goodbyes now.
[119:20.01]Yeah, I know, really.
[119:24.13]I mean, it's more intellect and more stamina, but I lose both of my most important stats.
[119:34.06]I would not do that.
[119:36.36]That's too, no.
[119:36.98]That's schmatt.
[119:37.60]It's all about eye level.
[119:39.36]No, you want to be able to brag to those mythic plus groups that you're joining that you got the eye level.
[119:44.32]It's just too much mastery to lose.
[119:47.20]What is your eye level?
[119:48.08]852.
[119:49.20]Hey, me too.
[119:51.22]I'm stuck.
[119:55.40]I can't trade this with anybody because it was technically a quote upgrade.
[119:59.18]And it's also cloth.
[120:00.10]Hey, you're the only cloth.
[120:01.36]Yeah.
[120:02.30]Alright, so what would... plus five?
[120:05.76]What was it?
[120:07.96]I mean, I got a Vault of the Wardens plus five from that.
[120:11.74]That's so tough, man.
[120:14.12]So are we going to do a Germans plus six?
[120:17.10]I mean, you know, we could try it.
[120:20.06]I mean, we're going to complete it eventually.
[120:22.04]We're going to complete it eventually.
[120:22.96]We're going to get our asses kicked, but, you know, we could try doing it.
[120:27.28]Might as well.
[120:27.58]Let's go.
[120:28.70]Yeah.
[120:30.14]Wait, what?
[120:31.86]We're doing a plus six now.
[120:38.55]What's with this joke about my height in chat?
[120:41.21]What's going on here?
[120:41.91]I'm not the tallest guy.
[120:44.95]I'm 5'8".
[120:45.75]That's like you're small, but you're not like wicked small.
[120:50.23]Maybe they're talking about Jocko.
[120:51.71]Well, the more you talk about it, the more it becomes a joke.
[120:54.55]Alright, boo, I need your thing because I want to go back to not looking like a total fucking moron.
[120:59.83]Where are you?
[121:02.34]Oh, well... Oh, we're all four just standing here.
[121:05.32]Yeah, let's go.
[121:07.36]Where are we going?
[121:11.80]Germa, what's here?
[121:13.02]Plus six?
[121:16.66]You're taking us to Tall Brand?
[121:24.30]What's your keystone, Jeremiah?
[121:27.09]Six Halls of Valor.
[121:30.51]Halls of Valor plus six.
[121:32.59]I mean, we can't, if you want to do it, we'll get embarrassed.
[121:35.43]I am Halls of Valor plus two.
[121:38.31]The top picture begs a difference.
[121:40.87]Oh, I was like, I was purposely pushing my body down.
[121:44.80]I'm like four inches taller than that picture.
[121:47.56]I was doing that like on purpose.
[121:49.22]We were like kind of leaning down and I like was scrunching my knees down and like pushing my body down.
[121:54.60]In that picture, I'm like five two.
[121:56.58]This is your warning.
[121:59.17]It looks like I'm literally, like, five feet tall in that picture.
[122:01.77]It's funny.
[122:02.27]Why are my lights on?
[122:03.09]Stella.
[122:05.50]Oh, hello, Stella.
[122:06.52]You're a dog.
[122:07.66]Oh, my goodness.
[122:08.78]Oh.
[122:11.52]Okay.
[122:12.30]It's going to be really weird for 1,200 people to listen to.
[122:15.70]Like, I'm used to it, but just other 1,200 people.
[122:19.14]Thinking about them, you know?
[122:19.94]At least 1,100 of those 1,200 have a dog, and they do that same thing.
[122:27.51]Hey, thank you.
[122:28.77]Thank you, Dandy, for the 12 months.

[123:11.46]Let's head to Odin's Landing.
[123:16.73]Hold on.
[123:17.07]I had to wear it?
[123:18.09]King's Landing?
[123:19.39]Yeah.
[123:20.43]I said Odin's Landing.
[123:26.06]King's Landing?
[123:28.90]I don't even know where Odin's landing is.
[123:30.72]Thank you, Major598.
[123:31.46]And he needs me for the bits.
[123:33.92]Your height is even lower than your upload speed.
[123:35.18]Odin's landing is not a play.
[123:36.46]You know who Odin is?
[123:37.32]That's technically true.
[123:38.56]Because I'm supposed to have like 15 feet up.
[123:40.31]You know what I mean?
[123:42.71]Get that DKP.
[123:43.59]Thank you, HappyCyclops for the 30 bits.
[123:46.19]Thank you, Negotiator.
[123:47.81]Rovalone for five months.
[123:49.07]You are short.
[123:51.11]You guys are mean.
[123:51.91]Who's going to go there to help summon?
[123:53.23]Colin Crusader, thanks for five months.
[123:54.89]Wait, sorry, I forgot.
[123:55.63]Are we doing Volto Halls?
[123:57.15]Halls of Valor rank two or six.
[123:59.98]Oh, okay.
[124:00.72]We're doing Halls of Valor plus six.
[124:04.08]I got plus two.
[124:06.10]Same.
[124:06.44]I want the chest.
[124:08.48]Well, what's your plus two?
[124:09.40]I mean, we could... Halls of Valor.
[124:11.59]Halls of Valor, plus two.
[124:12.71]That's what I've been saying.
[124:14.37]All right, so it's either plus two, like, wow, look at these good streamers, like, fucking doing this dungeon fast.
[124:18.73]You want more than one chest?
[124:20.37]Yeah, or it's, like, Halls of Valor plus six, and, like, wow.
[124:22.25]Okay, what's better?
[124:23.25]All of us to get, like, eye level 400 gear?
[124:25.23]Like, because that's what's going to happen when we trade this to plus two.
[124:29.53]Or, like, two of us get, like, eye level, like, 1,000 gear.
[124:34.49]I mean, we could... We've done Hall of Valor so much that I feel like we know... We might not beat the timer, but we'll at least beat the instance.
[124:42.11]Let's make no mistake.
[124:43.70]Plus six will be a slug.
[124:45.70]Hold on a second.
[124:47.10]We're going to let the stream vote.
[124:49.74]Oh, my gosh.
[124:50.82]Uh-oh.
[124:51.68]Stream's going to vote.
[124:52.66]Plus six it is.
[124:55.68]Alright, you ready?
[124:56.26]Let's get a straw poll here.
[124:58.28]It's all fun and games until wipe number four.
[125:01.64]And then we just walk out and put the other keys down.
[125:04.14]I think we would die a few times.
[125:06.49]I think we'd wipe on Heimdall a few times.
[125:08.73]Boss number one.
[125:11.45]I don't even think we'd get there.
[125:12.85]I think we'd wipe a few times on the first stormcaller.
[125:17.83]There's one rough trash bag right before Heimdall.
[125:26.47]Somebody says we should do a regular dungeon.
[125:30.92]See, my idea was... I don't even know.
[125:35.74]I got a poll for you guys.
[125:36.78]You ready for the poll?
[125:37.50]Alright, go vote.
[125:39.40]Vote on this poll.
[125:41.96]Vote now.
[125:47.83]That's a good poll.
[126:00.44]Vote.
[126:01.90]See, you see what you guys don't know.
[126:06.82]Prank call pizza.
[126:08.54]See, that's the garbage vote, and whoever wins the real vote is what we're doing.
[126:14.20]Oh, it's genius.
[126:15.86]Except it's still going to be plus six.
[126:17.92]Well, I voted for... Here we go.
[126:19.77]Here we go.
[126:20.29]I'm going.
[126:29.01]I think it's the brackets LOL that gets me.
[126:32.51]Alright, Pizza Hut.
[126:35.03]Pizza Hut.
[126:43.66]Hold on.
[126:47.38]Let's get a Pizza Hut number and let's go like this.
[126:57.36]Okay.
[127:03.67]No, no, what are you doing?
[127:07.80]What are you doing?
[127:08.34]No, no, I'm calling Pizza Hut, and I'm going to order a large cheese.
[127:13.44]Oh, what a prank.
[127:22.11]That's like such a bad text.
[127:24.53]What?
[127:43.76]He's gonna laugh in the middle of it.
[127:48.41]Wait, what?
[127:52.85]Pizza's closed.
[127:55.51]Pizza Hut's closed.
[127:58.30]It's 9 p.m.
[128:00.74]Pizza Hut's fucking closed.
[128:05.52]Hold on, let's do it again.
[128:08.14]Find another Pizza Hut to call.
[128:37.21]A hush falls over.
[128:39.05]The team speak.
[128:40.23]I'm looking up where Pizza Hut is.
[128:44.16]You don't need to know where it is.
[128:49.76]Alright, I'm calling.
[128:53.49]I got a new one.
[129:05.07]Hi, uh, yeah, can I get a large cheese beer?
[129:07.47]Pizza sucks!
[129:08.77]He's gone.
[129:10.81]Oh my gosh.
[129:11.85]Wait, was that real?
[129:21.48]Did you just fucking yell?
[129:23.78]Okay, was he really gone before you did the yell?
[129:39.38]That was like my friend.
[129:40.56]I like tell them to do that.
[129:43.42]I knew it.
[129:44.77]I knew it.
[129:48.05]You asshole.
[129:48.99]You fucking belted.
[129:50.83]I was like texting my friend.
[129:54.65]I'm like, hey, just say you have pizza and I'm going to call you for a second.
[129:59.37]I knew it.
[129:59.79]That's what I would have done.
[130:12.11]Oh, Pizza Hut, can I help you?
[130:13.42]Yeah, you guys got pranked.
[130:15.60]That was really convincing.
[130:19.05]Pizza Hut, can I help you?
[130:23.21]All right, what do we do?
[130:24.51]Yeah, I pranked you guys with a fake prank call to one of my friends.
[130:29.91]They would also say their location is Pizza Hut at Lexington 3rd.
[130:34.71]I bet he's disappointed that it didn't go on longer.
[130:38.05]He was probably ready to, like, he assumed the role.
[130:40.42]He's at work.
[130:41.52]He's, like, at work right now.
[130:43.42]Where does he work?
[130:44.92]He's like, I can do that real quick.
[130:46.44]Is that a question?
[130:49.02]He works at Domino's.
[130:51.92]He just pretended to be a Pizza Hut employee.
[130:53.48]So you told your buddy you were going to call him, but he actually works at Pizza Hut.
[130:56.68]So that's the double prank.
[130:57.68]He sent me a message.
[130:58.44]He was like, he's like, yo, I can't talk right now.
[131:00.54]What's up?
[131:00.86]I was like, hey, just pretend to be Pizza Hut for like two seconds.
[131:02.96]He's like, I'm at work.
[131:03.78]I'll do it.
[131:04.12]Okay, I can do it.
[131:05.85]So he just like did that.
[131:07.19]He might have just gotten in trouble for doing that.
[131:11.53]What a trooper.
[131:12.85]But all right.
[131:13.33]Yeah.
[131:13.77]So are we doing plus six?
[131:16.07]I couldn't make it to Halls of Valor because it's hard.
[131:19.40]I am here at Hotsa Valley.
[131:21.20]I ran inside nothing.
[131:22.16]I'm at the stone.
[131:25.20]I'm at the stone.
[131:26.18]How far did you get at Alex?
[131:26.98]Where can I raise you?
[131:27.96]Oh, yeah, I'm like in the room.
[131:32.83]Wait, your body's... What the hell?
[131:34.29]Your body is in the room.
[131:35.89]Who killed you?
[131:36.63]A bunch of horde.
[131:38.03]It was like three minutes ago.
[131:40.59]This tombstone is so far away.
[131:43.50]Oh, yeah, don't even... Call them and say you're sorry.
[131:48.72]Rest time.
[131:49.62]Pizza Hut, can I help you?
[131:53.02]Yeah, I thought, okay, so either, yeah, you had a friend be Pizza Hut, or after they said, can I help you, you hung up, and then you shouted.
[132:00.81]Oh, yeah, no, no.
[132:01.73]Which that could have been a possibility, too.
[132:03.61]He sent me a text.
[132:04.33]He said he just, like, laughed, like, a minute ago.
[132:07.63]What'd he say?
[132:08.05]LOL?
[132:08.31]Yeah, he said LOL.
[132:09.79]It was all capitals.
[132:11.45]What if you get another text?
[132:12.77]Plus 5-8.
[132:14.35]Halls of Valor.
[132:15.07]Ha ha ha.
[132:18.71]Yeah, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[132:22.51]Alright, Mike.
[132:22.89]What if he texts you and he's like, uh, Jorma's still waiting on this joke, and you actually called Pete the Hutt?
[132:28.31]That would've been pretty funny.
[132:32.35]I'm gonna press my C as long.
[132:33.39]We can't start yet.
[132:33.93]Alright, yeah, I'm gonna go in the... Dugas!
[132:38.06]Dugas!
[132:41.18]No!
[132:41.78]Spellsteal.
[132:42.29]All of his beneficial spells.
[132:44.95]Mariah, you don't need to shoot him.
[132:47.53]He's a bear.
[132:48.19]She's a hunter.
[132:48.91]Oh, shit.
[132:49.97]What?
[132:50.13]I was just melee attacking him to be fun.
[132:55.47]The amount of damage we're doing to that bear, we may as well just be petting him.
[133:00.48]I'm going to take a short little tea break, pee break.
[133:04.41]And I want to be like Keystone in right now.
[133:06.55]By the way, we're in no man's land now.
[133:07.97]It's nine o'clock Eastern.
[133:09.70]You know what that means?
[133:10.46]Oh, geez.
[133:11.12]Anything can happen.
[133:12.12]That means the stream is going to go down in the next like 20 to 30 minutes.
[133:15.72]So blame Comcast.
[133:17.72]I'm going to get a snack.
[133:19.84]I'll be right back.
[133:20.60]Hopefully the stream is still live when I get back.
[133:22.96]And we can at least get one more thing done.
[133:24.72]So BRB, BRB.
[133:26.55]Mute the stream so we can talk about private things for a second.
[133:30.97]No.
[133:31.29]Thank you.
[133:32.59]We're not even going to be here.
[133:34.35]I'm going to talk about private things then.
[133:36.02]What do you mean private things?
[133:36.94]Your stream's going to hear it.
[133:38.58]Why are you going to talk about private things?
[133:40.76]There's like 12 channels in this TeamSpeak.
[133:44.16]Stream's going to hear it.
[133:46.04]No, I'm not viewing it.
[133:48.52]They're going to hear you have private stuff.
[133:52.60]All right, I'm I'm gonna mute my mic if you want to talk about private things just fucking just drop down a channel Because I want them to hear the world of Warcraft sounds I was farting like all weekend Okay All right now Okay, he's gone.
[134:08.11]He's gone.
[134:08.53]He didn't they can't hear you Yeah, right when you said I farted yeah, it was gone So all right literally nobody can hear anything I BRB.
[134:17.65]I'm well, maybe they can I don't know don't don't I don't trust it But I'm I'm muting everything BRB
[136:15.31]Alright, I'm back.
[136:16.81]I'm back.
[136:17.15]Hey, you guys are on.
[136:17.73]You guys are on.
[136:18.11]Stop, stop.
[136:18.47]Yeah, I pooped my pants.
[136:19.08]Right in his pants.
[136:19.94]Oh, really?
[136:20.48]Yeah.
[136:20.76]Alright, are we doing... This is plus six, right?
[136:33.92]Uh, uh, yeah.
[136:36.44]We can do whatever plus we want to.
[136:38.32]You know, if Boo doesn't have enough faith in us, and Italics doesn't have enough faith in us, then we can just do plus two.
[136:44.21]Whatever you guys want to do.
[136:45.49]I'll do whatever.
[136:46.81]We're doing it.
[136:47.43]Plus six.
[136:47.79]We're going to slog it.
[136:49.63]The goal is to beat plus six before Gemma disconnects.
[136:52.66]Yeah.
[136:54.46]You're playing WoW right now.
[136:56.04]Your love of the game encouraged me to try it out.
[136:57.74]Loving it so far.
[136:58.42]Playing as a Draenei.
[137:00.86]Priest is pretty good right now.
[137:01.92]Especially Shadow.
[137:04.21]It's your funeral.
[137:07.07]Yeah.
[137:09.09]I'm glad that you got into WoW.
[137:11.21]Especially this is the perfect time to get into it because this is the only expansion they've done that's been any good in like six and a half years.
[137:16.71]I mean like...
[137:18.79]Mr. Pandaria was like a band-aid on like a fucking Okay, my first one I guess like somebody fucking stuck like a broadsword through the chest of World of Warcraft and Mr. Pandaria was like a small band-aid.
[137:31.48]Stop it.
[137:31.94]I'm pulling.
[137:32.69]Fuck you.
[137:33.27]Jerma, put in your keystone.
[137:35.23]I don't have a keystone.
[137:36.45]Who's the plus six?
[137:37.47]It's Alex.
[137:38.29]I have a plus two.
[137:39.63]Who's the plus six?
[137:43.59]I was making a joke.
[137:45.71]I don't have a plus six.
[137:46.95]Let's go.
[137:50.52]I don't know what's true and what's a lie anymore.
[137:53.54]Eat, eat, eat.
[137:54.42]Quick refreshment.
[137:56.30]I already have a hundred.
[137:57.84]I don't know what to believe.
[138:00.53]Alright, these guys cleave.
[138:01.35]Don't stand in front of them.
[138:02.49]Don't stand in the cleave.
[138:04.11]Everyone stand in the cleave.
[138:05.70]These guys have a ton of cleavage.
[138:07.64]Watch out.
[138:10.04]Make sure you look them in the eyes.
[138:11.32]Oof.
[138:13.64]Yeah, I'm gonna... It's just that one attack.
[138:17.24]Oh, dude, he's getting junked.
[138:18.98]My eyes are up here.
[138:21.17]I just got whispered.
[138:22.27]Somebody said, Hey, boo.
[138:23.41]Tell German, Mists of Pandaria was the best expansion.
[138:25.97]Oh!
[138:28.62]I'm glad you got whispered that, Dukas.
[138:30.02]Uh, rather than Lich King, excuse me.
[138:34.48]Alright.
[138:34.92]These people need to be interrupted at some point, right?
[138:36.32]Interrupt him.
[138:36.90]He cares quite fast, though, so, uh, be on... ...Thundercaller.
[138:41.64]And he needs to die first, because he's a- Oh, I'm gonna blow you up.
[138:50.87]Oh, get knocked back.
[138:51.85]That was like a suplex.
[138:54.25]You lifted him up and I, like, stunned and dropped him.
[138:57.23]That was actually a super wrestling combo.
[139:01.16]Wrestling?
[139:02.52]Did you see A.J.
[139:03.10]Saab versus James Ellsworth?
[139:04.42]No.
[139:04.74]Oh, okay.
[139:07.72]All right.
[139:09.00]Burning Crusade was actually really great.
[139:11.04]Polymorph left Thundercolor.
[139:14.10]You got it.
[139:17.16]Never mind.
[139:17.66]He rammed way too far.
[139:19.09]Get him again.
[139:24.79]Don't stay in front of the Drake.
[139:25.67]He breathes.
[139:30.08]Everybody scoot closer a little.
[139:32.48]I'll buy attacks.
[139:33.04]I have a stun.
[139:35.64]I have a stun.
[139:36.96]Kill that champion.
[139:40.79]This is the wipe!
[139:42.47]This is where we wipe!
[139:43.17]Oh, it is.
[139:47.11]I warned you all.
[139:48.85]I warned you all.
[139:50.59]Everyone release.
[139:53.04]Just catch them.
[139:53.58]They're going to run towards us.
[139:54.94]Yes, they are.
[139:58.40]And we'll just take them.
[140:10.25]Come at me.
[140:10.95]Yeah beavers do whatever need a fucking bar.
[140:14.47]Oh my gosh help Our taxes are reviving I need a fucking car for this one.
[140:21.08]I'm a little just either I took a drink and I just figured after the first time I really spirit over I
[140:28.99]But no, the nightmare continues.
[140:31.81]Now I'm dead again.
[140:33.83]Just die.
[140:36.57]I can't wake up from this nightmare.
[140:41.09]Who is still alive?
[140:42.10]What is going on?
[140:42.84]Dugas is still alive.
[140:45.82]They're just bouncing back and forth, killing everyone.
[140:52.62]What are we doing?
[140:54.41]All right.
[140:54.95]Now we can release.
[140:55.57]We can release.
[140:56.79]I think we're trying to see how many five-second... Yeah, we knocked about two minutes off our time there.
[141:06.11]I told you we wouldn't even make it to the first boss.
[141:08.60]No, okay.
[141:09.64]So I'm going to... Me and Boo need to do that at the same time because you were pulling as Boo was telling me to polymorph.
[141:16.72]So let's do that.
[141:18.24]Now I know that.
[141:19.20]Miscommunication.
[141:20.02]It doesn't matter.
[141:20.54]Miscommunication.
[141:22.14]I'll just have this guy pull the other three.
[141:24.80]I'm going to polymorph this dude on the left.
[141:26.72]What?
[141:27.38]No, we don't need to.
[141:28.30]We'll just take the three.
[141:28.98]I forgot that I had my lightning surge totem and I can, you know, stun everybody.
[141:32.34]I was under the impression that that one was going to be... I got an add on me.
[141:37.02]Excuse me.
[141:37.96]What's happening?
[141:38.66]Oh my gosh.
[141:40.20]Alex is dead already.
[141:42.23]You know, I wouldn't have to heal myself if there's two people here, if the other one person wasn't on me.
[141:48.87]Yeah, well, you know why?
[141:49.87]It's because I was, right before I pulled, what was said was, the person on the left, I am going to polymorph.
[141:55.92]I thought, well, that's what we did last time.
[141:57.92]You didn't polymorph him, though.
[142:00.16]Yes, I did.
[142:02.08]The thunder caller, not the guy on the left.
[142:08.46]Well, hold on.
[142:09.70]Wait, wait, let's get- hold on a second.
[142:11.55]The reason I said I don't- So what last time did the guy all the way to the left, I did the other guy on the left?
[142:15.81]What changed this time?
[142:16.35]It's cause one of them is dead.
[142:18.67]From the previous pull.
[142:20.11]Don't we- If we're gonna do this dungeon, we don't need to... separate that many.
[142:24.38]We can do pulls of three, if we're gonna beat it.
[142:26.46]Fuckin' outta here.
[142:28.96]Alright.
[142:30.88]I'm gonna snap the guy on the right.
[142:32.16]And we're gonna successfully clear this group of three on the left.
[142:34.74]We're just going to kill the three on the left.
[142:36.16]Okay.
[142:36.84]Let's go.
[142:37.23]Are we ready?
[142:37.77]Because we're big boys and girls here.
[142:41.13]Pizza Hut sucks.
[142:43.39]So I'm pulling all three this time.
[142:47.33]Let's do a ready check.
[142:48.73]I can't wait to get three chests.
[142:52.82]Are you guys ready for that?
[142:54.14]We could've.
[142:54.46]Yep.
[143:05.94]I'm stunned.
[143:16.84]I'm gonna tag that guy over there.
[143:27.29]He's alive.
[143:27.73]Alright, now I can do damage.
[143:49.35]Thunder Collar!
[143:51.05]Oh, goodness.
[143:55.21]They got nothing for that cast.
[143:58.34]Them bolts hurt, man.
[143:59.88]They really do.
[144:01.82]Alright, here we go!
[144:03.14]We've got to hide.
[144:03.82]That was, like, really easy.
[144:04.56]We've got to hide well.
[144:06.86]Like, jeez, this is... There's too many miscommunications.
[144:10.87]Yeah, our comms are cluttered.
[144:13.00]Wait a minute.
[144:15.10]Are we dying?
[144:15.86]Is this it?
[144:18.48]This might be it.
[144:21.38]Oh, this is definitely it.
[144:22.96]You guys are all breaking up robot.
[144:24.30]I think this might be the end.
[144:25.54]I think it was team speak.
[144:29.09]I think we're good.
[144:30.17]I think he said comms are cluttered.
[144:33.13]Wait, wait, wait.
[144:34.77]I have to do something really quick.
[144:38.95]Somebody wanted to see this screen.
[144:41.93]Here are my achievements.
[144:43.07]If somebody wants to see my achievements that I have totaled.
[144:45.39]Oh yeah, we're not on the timer.
[144:46.51]Yeah, that's fine.
[144:49.09]You think we're gonna get this timer?
[144:50.25]Are you shitting me?
[144:51.97]We could.
[144:53.60]Well, not anymore.
[144:54.66]Alright, ready?
[144:55.70]I'm ready.
[144:55.96]I don't have any arcane charges.
[144:57.06]I'm a fucking idiot.
[144:57.80]Alright.
[144:59.38]The Undeserved!
[145:12.18]a burden to the soul.
[145:13.48]A burden that someone... Where's the backside?
[145:16.92]Backside?
[145:19.20]I popped all my cooldowns.
[145:21.32]A burden to the soul.
[145:22.48]You popped all your cooldowns?
[145:24.38]Yeah.
[145:25.44]Why?
[145:25.64]Oh, yeah.
[145:26.42]We need to reach it here.
[145:28.18]On this fucking jump?
[145:29.96]What?
[145:30.20]We're not gonna get to the next guy within ten minutes.
[145:32.08]On this fucking idiot?
[145:32.54]We're not gonna get to the next guy, period.
[145:35.06]Yes, we are.
[145:35.81]He doesn't have any faith.
[145:43.77]Alright, where are the drakes?
[145:49.24]Where are the drakes?
[145:51.30]Not coming here.
[145:51.76]There's going to be three, though, so beware.
[145:57.21]Three?
[145:57.51]Right here, right in front of us.
[145:59.83]Front, front, front.
[146:02.89]Watch out for the line tornadoes as well.
[146:04.89]Back, back, back.
[146:05.73]Backside.
[146:07.19]Middle's safe.
[146:08.30]Middle is safe.
[146:09.10]Middle is now unsafe.
[146:10.58]Go to the boss site.
[146:11.12]Middle is now unsafe.
[146:11.94]Middle is now unsafe.
[146:12.76]Middle is now unsafe.
[146:14.90]Oh, fuck it.
[146:15.54]Don't even care.
[146:16.94]Oh, Talix died and then undied.
[146:19.79]Correct.
[146:20.65]No, I didn't actually.
[146:23.03]Oh, we're standing on a thing.
[146:25.57]I died, but I reincarnated.
[146:26.77]And then I died.
[146:29.19]He's still close.
[146:32.58]What's he need?
[146:35.32]A third of his health.
[146:36.38]No, he stops and he goes, oh, you've beaten me.
[146:39.77]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[146:40.97]Maybe 1%?
[146:41.25]Whatever, I'm popping my stuff.
[146:44.17]I'm popping my things.
[146:45.85]Where are the drakes?
[146:47.47]Oh, shit.
[146:49.46]We have to cross into the middle.
[146:52.02]Come on, Jocko!
[146:54.74]Come on, Jocko!
[146:56.32]Do it, you can do it.
[146:59.32]You need to do like 15 million damage.
[147:02.00]This is not the same as the other guy.
[147:04.64]He will catch up to you.
[147:07.36]Okay, I suggest we repair.
[147:10.30]Oh, I'm at 39%.
[147:11.26]Oh yeah, I've given up on this timer.
[147:17.90]Okay, yeah, Jerma, show them all the achievements, yeah?
[147:19.64]Show them all of your achievements, one by one.
[147:23.56]One at a time.
[147:26.78]Oh my goodness.
[147:29.06]Our heroes have failed us.
[147:30.55]Okay, let's just wait eight minutes until hero's up again.
[147:38.23]Why do I think that's so funny?
[147:40.49]Let's wait eight minutes until we have hero again.
[147:42.94]Their only hope.
[147:44.80]This is my eye level.
[147:52.39]I'm always asking for it.
[147:55.13]852!
[147:57.39]Show your keybinds.
[147:59.83]You can see them, see?
[148:00.78]Mouse, mouse, mouse, mouse, Q, Q, Q, mouse, mouse, mouse.
[148:06.32]So, only seven and a half more minutes?
[148:09.38]Ready when you are.
[148:10.38]Okay.
[148:11.62]Uh, yes.
[148:12.44]Ready.
[148:12.76]Three, two, one, go.
[148:14.04]Alright, no more fucking around, let's kill him.
[148:24.67]This isn't even the hard one.
[148:28.66]This is the easy one.
[148:31.00]What happened, Ryan?
[148:32.26]I think in the back.
[148:33.98]Things happened.
[148:36.40]Where's the next one?
[148:41.09]There's only one on the first one.
[148:42.61]Oh, okay, right.
[148:55.72]Uh, dance and swords are getting a little close.
[149:09.29]I'm already at half mana.
[149:11.69]What the fuck just hit me?
[149:12.49]Alright, where they at?
[149:13.49]The horn will do it.
[149:15.61]Middle.
[149:15.91]Middle, middle, middle.
[149:17.25]Front.
[149:17.57]Ow, what?
[149:18.19]Middle and front?
[149:19.23]Oh, fuck.
[149:20.93]I'm just gonna block.
[149:23.66]Oh my gosh.
[149:25.32]We're not going to be able to do this.
[149:28.56]It is over.
[149:37.15]Fucking kill me!
[149:37.89]What the hell is he doing?
[149:38.91]Oh, how about that?
[149:43.32]Mythic Keystone plus two.
[149:44.56]Sounds good.
[149:45.14]Let's do it.
[149:45.52]I think Odin's probably going to kick us out.
[149:50.78]Noble champions, it seems you can't get past the first boss in plus six.
[149:57.21]All five of you are fucking awful, except for Boo.
[150:01.17]Boo's doing a lot of damage.
[150:02.60]He deserves a medal.
[150:04.84]He can only click on this chest.
[150:06.76]He's the only one.
[150:09.22]The rest of you scrubs, get the fuck out of my hall.
[150:18.62]When we beat Heimdall, that's when we leave.
[150:26.03]It only gets harder.
[150:30.27]It would get easier.
[150:31.53]This boss, you have to do a lot of dodging things.
[150:34.17]You don't have to do that with any other boss.
[150:35.61]Fenrir is like a chump.
[150:37.83]Herjul's a chump.
[150:38.70]I don't think so.
[150:41.02]This is the wall right here.
[150:42.40]Tell Talak that this is the hardest boss in the dungeon.
[150:45.78]This is one of the hardest.
[150:46.72]This guy's pretty hard.
[150:47.96]It's one of the hardest?
[150:48.96]There's only four bosses.
[150:50.00]There's only so many that can be considered one of the hardest.
[150:53.23]He's like number two.
[150:55.25]I pull.
[150:55.85]I pull.
[150:56.21]I pull.
[150:56.61]What?
[150:56.79]What are you doing?
[150:57.49]What?
[150:58.95]What the fuck?
[151:00.37]What have you thought?
[151:01.41]What have you thought?
[151:02.13]For everyone who was not kicked out, he's revoked his privilege.
[151:10.04]Immediate.
[151:10.78]What the hell?
[151:11.50]Where are they?
[151:12.62]In the front.
[151:13.30]Front.
[151:13.48]Front.
[151:13.74]Front.
[151:14.06]Move.
[151:14.68]Front.
[151:16.29]From the underwear.
[151:22.36]I'm sorry.
[151:26.90]I don't know what I thought that button would do.
[151:28.48]I thought it would just do an emote or something.
[151:30.42]Can I get arcane missiles?
[151:31.42]What the fuck?
[151:32.32]Fuck!
[151:32.60]I'm gonna try pulling him back to the middle.
[151:39.21]Oh, too many dancing blades!
[151:40.99]Good place to keep him.
[151:42.39]Probably.
[151:50.91]Where's it where's it where's it wow what the fuck just hit me?
[151:54.36]Everybody's saying the screen start cross-eyed Where's the next one?
[151:59.18]middle middle oh gosh Okay, everyone's out arrangement cuz there's another one coming around What?
[152:11.11]Oh, you just freaked.
[152:11.81]Boo, you scared the shit out of me.
[152:13.57]I thought that would be... I'm like bad.
[152:15.71]I'm sorry.
[152:16.11]Oh my god, I just fucking seriously shit my pants.
[152:20.16]Oh, I have another story.
[152:21.32]You don't well shit his pants.
[152:23.82]I did.
[152:24.24]When you pulled... Apparently everybody did.
[152:26.16]When you pulled, I was like, which one's my tongue?
[152:28.66]I actually couldn't remember.
[152:30.66]I was just kind of leaning back and my fingers just wanted to click.
[152:34.24]Gee, wave.
[152:34.86]I'm about to die.
[152:36.30]Here comes some drakes.
[152:37.00]Middle.
[152:37.92]Middle?
[152:38.30]Okay.
[152:42.20]Our side.
[152:45.86]The one we're on.
[152:49.46]All the way in the end.
[152:53.80]I'm going to do this.
[152:55.60]Apparently I did die at one point already.
[153:02.81]Come on.
[153:03.71]Give me a chance to cast.
[153:04.53]I'm out of mana.
[153:05.43]Zero mana.
[153:06.43]What?
[153:06.71]Alright, popping my emergencies.
[153:10.94]Oh, did it.
[153:11.50]Woo!
[153:14.04]Alright, nothing left.
[153:15.26]Alright, take a breather.
[153:17.12]Okay, I actually think we can do the rest now that we did time.
[153:21.86]I think we can, too.
[153:22.86]I mean, I think we could do it eventually if you throw enough bodies at the dungeon.
[153:28.80]That took you long enough.
[153:30.46]That was just despicable display.
[153:32.39]I don't think it's going to be like... It took you how many wipes to kill the first boss?
[153:37.17]Way too many.
[153:39.85]We could either get this guy, or we could just go on the left and pull those guys up the stairs so the patrol isn't... But not too far up the stairs.
[153:50.02]Uh, no.
[153:50.84]No risks.
[153:52.30]No risks.
[153:53.00]No risks, no rewards.
[153:54.30]No risks.
[153:55.38]We're already past the no reward point.
[154:01.08]At least somebody's gonna get, like, an 870 piece of gear.
[154:03.42]Well, that's the hope, at least.
[154:11.22]I keep thinking one of those totems is a bad thing that's not standing.
[154:15.76]Shit.
[154:18.26]We need to move.
[154:19.32]Yep.
[154:22.69]Yep.
[154:31.13]Crackle!
[154:35.82]Aw, crap.
[154:36.30]I'm just gonna take the damage.
[154:37.28]Sorry, Rook.
[154:38.17]Oh my god!
[154:41.19]I'm just gonna take the damage.
[154:42.83]No big deal.
[154:43.75]Only I can do that.
[154:44.89]If I'm gonna drop that low, I'd rather just die for the fun at that point.
[154:48.43]Look at all these Jupiters.
[154:50.26]Yeah, a lot of fall Jupiters.
[154:51.72]It's pretty cool.
[154:54.36]Thunder Caller first.
[154:58.20]Yeah, I interrupted him.
[154:59.60]I'll get the second one too.
[155:01.74]Okay, you have to do the rest.
[155:06.65]No, I can't.
[155:07.11]I've got to circle.
[155:09.21]I'll get the next one.
[155:09.97]Oh, I'm dying.
[155:10.51]Not that one.
[155:10.92]He's doing a... Ah, I'm being zapped.
[155:13.24]What's he doing?
[155:23.28]He's etching.
[155:23.64]He's using an etch-a-sketch.
[155:33.69]Okay.
[155:34.59]This is the CC group.
[155:38.84]Wait, before we do anything, what's going on here?
[155:42.68]Well, on the third or fourth attempt, we'll get through this group.
[155:46.98]I'm going to polymorph the left Thunder Collar.
[155:49.89]Yep, you polymorph that guy.
[155:52.15]And I will sap just this champion.
[155:55.75]So pull him down the stairs then.
[155:57.41]Which champion?
[155:58.13]I was going to sap that champion.
[155:59.65]Okay, so I'm going to polymorph, and then we're going to pull them down the stairs.
[156:02.67]My pull normally ricochets off of the guys.
[156:11.29]I'm going to have to just run in.
[156:12.43]Watch the group behind us.
[156:14.67]Yeah, don't get on these stairs.
[156:17.97]Don't attack any of them until I get back to this step.
[156:20.28]All right, well, wait until I polymorph.
[156:21.88]I'm just going to run back.
[156:23.48]Well, you've got to hurry because that sap's about to run out.
[156:25.70]Oh, here we go.
[156:26.81]I'll reapply.
[156:28.85]Ready?
[156:31.29]Oh my gosh, I'm going in.
[156:33.13]Come to me, babies.
[156:33.83]Watch out for that sheep.
[156:40.04]Oh, my face.
[156:44.50]The blood of the unworthy.
[156:47.12]I stunned them all.
[156:52.58]interrupt room to feel that's pretty fast actually move my left hand if you can get up and I can't do it that would be a good life political my life I feel it's alex well I think it hopes what's with that well whoops what's my least favorites and what's
[157:24.14]Let's focus this champ.
[157:25.38]Okay, get the Runecaller.
[157:29.02]Ah, he's fucking ruining me!
[157:38.29]God, can I please get an Arcane Missiles?
[157:40.24]What the absolute crap.
[157:46.89]For that fight, I had to pop my four-minute cooldown.
[157:51.17]I did not pop any of my three minutes.
[157:52.79]And I almost died anyway.
[157:56.04]At least twice.
[157:57.28]Now for the hot pot.
[157:58.24]Alright, mana.
[158:00.78]We're still alive.
[158:01.42]Oh, we're really doing it.
[158:04.45]Thanks a lot, True Blue, for eight months in a row.
[158:08.05]True Blue, that's like the Jet Blue points, right?
[158:15.97]German won't ever turn on his webcam again because he's too embarrassed over his height.
[158:20.23]I'm gonna pull all these guys around the corner.
[158:26.66]Here we go.
[158:26.96]Yeah, don't attack them.
[158:29.48]No, just let them all come out.
[158:32.76]We're gonna big boy it.
[158:34.24]They're not coming.
[158:35.62]They're there.
[158:39.00]Hey, I'm gonna hurt all of us.
[158:40.48]Yeah.
[158:41.88]Ow.
[158:49.45]Ooh, ow!
[158:51.05]Ooh, ow!
[158:52.73]Ooh, ow!
[158:53.09]Oh boy, I gotta fucking eat this.
[158:54.47]Thanks.
[158:54.81]Thanks a lot.
[158:56.84]I had to eat that there.
[158:57.68]There's nothing I can do.
[158:59.74]Wait, what?
[159:00.90]Oh.
[159:01.28]I had to eat it.
[159:01.88]Ailey.
[159:04.98]Bell, help me.
[159:05.47]Eat up.
[159:06.19]I... I am... Not eating that one.
[159:10.79]Kill the Thunderclaw.
[159:11.37]Don't worry, it's not gonna... You won't eat that.
[159:19.69]Maybe get some more armor items, and then I won't have to heal you as much.
[159:23.72]Well, I already died that fight, and I had to pop my emergency cooldown.
[159:27.38]All right, cool.
[159:31.08]We're going to be fine.
[159:32.10]Everyone's thinking the plus six is easy.
[159:33.97]I actually choked.
[159:37.57]This is the fucking easiest dungeon we've ever done.
[159:42.29]This is easier than regular, normal, non-heroic.
[159:47.68]Wait, which one do we do first?
[159:50.82]The table over there.
[159:53.52]You guys ready to hear Winston?
[159:56.97]We better run away.
[159:59.95]Here we go.
[160:10.26]Where's Winston?
[160:11.28]Waiting.
[160:11.88]He's coming up here.
[160:14.74]Oh, I thought you were going to do a voice.
[160:16.94]May as well pull him.
[160:17.98]Winston is like one of these guys.
[160:21.10]Where did your health go?
[160:22.34]I don't know.
[160:23.44]He's in rage.
[160:24.24]I'm dead.
[160:25.66]Oh boy.
[160:26.00]But it would have been fine except who said may as well pull.
[160:28.64]So I did.
[160:28.90]You can run back.
[160:35.11]You might come back before we all die.
[160:40.03]What is he doing?
[160:40.47]Get away from me.
[160:41.57]Get away from me.
[160:42.59]Don't hurt me.
[160:43.13]Excuse me.
[160:54.59]Okay, now he's enraged.
[160:56.34]I'm probably gonna die.
[160:57.52]Oh, no, that's gonna hurt.
[161:00.68]Nice.
[161:00.88]Alright, we're good.
[161:02.54]Don't worry.
[161:05.38]Need a heal.
[161:06.84]Uh, water.
[161:07.43]Drink.
[161:07.63]Two chests, this shit?
[161:08.57]Nice.
[161:08.77]Do you need water, or do you have some?
[161:10.99]We're, like, halfway gone.
[161:12.27]We only killed one boss.
[161:13.73]I'm good.
[161:14.11]I have lots of your waters.
[161:22.90]The worst thing about playing an arcane is the arcane familiar just disappears for no reason.
[161:27.32]Sometimes it just goes away.
[161:28.44]Just like dies.
[161:29.02]It's because we died a lot?
[161:32.82]No, I think it just can get hit by random shit.
[161:34.96]I don't know why.
[161:35.72]Sometimes it just like phases out for no reason too.
[161:45.00]This champ is probably gonna pass into us but it's... It'll be fine.
[161:48.50]It'll be fine.
[161:52.52]Focus Thundercaller.
[161:58.55]Thunder!
[161:59.81]Never mind, kill Rinkaba because he's lower.
[162:02.09]What?
[162:02.95]Whoa, you got like one shot by that thing.
[162:04.83]What the fuck?
[162:07.09]Oh, he did two million damage to me.
[162:10.24]That guy was just zapping me and I died.
[162:12.14]That guy zapped me for two million.
[162:13.64]That's all of my health.
[162:18.91]Yeah, I got etched for... Oh, there's another one!
[162:23.03]Wait, what?
[162:26.81]I think you guys will be alright.
[162:27.99]Should I release and just get over there?
[162:30.27]Yeah.
[162:32.17]You can mount up out there.
[162:33.25]I've got about 15 good seconds of surviving.
[162:36.63]Stay alive!
[162:37.31]Stay alive!
[162:40.21]Oh, watch those mobs over there.
[162:41.43]I saw them.
[162:44.27]Oh, you guys are doing the Cheetos and coffee?
[162:46.27]What's this coffee?
[162:47.02]Cheeto?
[162:47.40]Oh, okay.
[162:49.04]When he hits 30%, we might be screwed.
[162:51.78]I'm pretty much already dead.
[162:55.80]Run away from that, that's gonna kill you.
[162:56.91]I'm just gonna kite.
[163:02.67]Should we even be here right now?
[163:03.69]Oh, you're alive.
[163:04.93]Yeah, Dugas is gonna rescue us.
[163:11.49]Run away from any of those charged pulse, because that shit will really hurt.
[163:19.46]Run.
[163:19.64]Here it comes!
[163:26.68]I can breathe again.
[163:27.54]Oh, raw.
[163:29.40]I messed it up.
[163:29.94]It's not raw.
[163:35.23]Raw!
[163:41.21]Poor stupid kitty had such a long run.
[163:43.71]You can get on your running mount.
[163:45.97]I am doing it.
[163:50.17]Turn into a tree!
[164:06.20]You got my attention.
[164:09.36]Alright, we're already at 930.
[164:11.82]Well guys, we're getting close.
[164:14.03]Maybe we can at least get to the last boss before this dream dies.
[164:22.08]One in the corner.
[164:29.58]I got no interrupts left.
[164:36.78]Oh!
[164:39.13]Goodness.
[164:39.85]Yeah, when he does that power attack when he's enraged because of the affix, we have to pull this group.
[164:45.87]Yeah.
[164:46.11]Just pull them kind of inside the wall there ahead of us or something.
[164:50.34]All behind these kegs over here.
[164:51.60]Better, like, tank healer ability.
[164:55.10]You want to top me off, big boy?
[164:57.62]Yeah.
[164:58.56]I'm going to lose our king's forges.
[165:02.42]Go on.
[165:10.23]Oh, no.
[165:11.45]Wow.
[165:11.81]Hey!
[165:12.19]Hey!
[165:21.55]I got interrupts for the next couple.
[165:27.12]Whoa!
[165:29.82]I can get the next one.
[165:34.82]I got no more interrupts.
[165:36.76]Crap, I blew one.
[165:37.30]But look at...
[165:42.96]It's a no-meme zone.
[165:46.00]What?
[165:46.60]I need water before we attack again.
[165:50.94]Thanks a lot.
[165:51.44]It's me3i for seven months.
[165:53.44]Is there a healer that doesn't need mana?
[165:55.06]Is that right in front of you?
[165:58.61]Do you need more?
[165:59.53]I am fine, thank you.
[166:04.35]I'm good.
[166:04.83]Three, two, one, go.
[166:09.51]He's up there he's standing like on the Nice
[166:28.62]I am not nervous.
[166:30.21]Only excited.
[166:31.65]All my life has led to this one glorious moment.
[166:37.23]I've woken like a true valk.
[166:40.83]Mortal intruders emerge.
[166:43.38]I witness their deeds in Stormheim.
[166:46.00]I have no true honor.
[166:47.30]No true virtue.
[166:48.18]I will purge the sacred halls myself.
[166:50.18]The ritual is not yet complete.
[166:58.46]Pull up.
[167:01.74]Can we get a ready check on the pull?
[167:04.18]I'm ready.
[167:05.00]I'm ready.
[167:05.98]Go.
[167:17.87]Don't be in front of him, Jocko.
[167:21.17]I wasn't even in front of him.
[167:21.99]The game broke.
[167:22.99]My controller broke.
[167:23.51]The game broke.
[167:26.03]Yeah, I'm playing the controller.
[167:27.87]Yep.
[167:43.28]Oh, pull that dummy up there.
[167:55.16]Oh, shit.
[167:55.54]I have no more interrupts.
[167:57.38]All right.
[168:01.96]Ouch!
[168:02.68]That hurt.
[168:06.65]We're almost there.
[168:07.69]It's boss two.
[168:10.97]Then we just have to go all around the other side.
[168:13.13]Number three.
[168:14.96]I'm ready.
[168:16.26]Are you nervous?
[168:17.12]Heard ya.
[168:18.28]3, 2, 1, go.
[168:25.13]Oh, group them up.
[168:26.03]Where are you going?
[168:42.49]Apparently I died stealthed.
[168:46.59]So, uh, just FYI.
[168:47.77]Might have been when she did the blaster light.
[168:54.55]I feel like I have hacks on.
[168:55.76]Like, every three minutes I can cheat.
[168:57.82]You guys have to wait, like, at least ten seconds here.
[169:00.26]Alright, are we going left, right, right, or right, left, left?
[169:02.32]I just pull them both.
[169:04.10]Right?
[169:06.94]I pulled them both.
[169:08.28]No, I'm talking about when Herjo comes down.
[169:13.72]uh I'll just attack one and then every single time that she does the shield bash that blasts me we switch to the other side okay
[169:31.98]What happened?
[169:32.94]It seems to be a running theme of, uh... I... Okay, honest to God, I don't even... I don't know what the fuck I just did.
[169:40.14]It wasn't good, whatever it was.
[169:41.06]Uh, nobody get hit by this.
[169:44.72]It wasn't good.
[169:45.29]Don't get hit by even one of these.
[169:46.59]I did it!
[169:52.17]Aw, somebody got hit by it.
[169:53.37]Somebody got hit.
[169:57.51]Talix is getting ready to pull one boss.
[170:01.61]Turns around I'm so sorry.
[170:05.77]It was just like I freaked out for a second.
[170:07.79]I pressed like the wrong button You mean you didn't push you pushed anything except w dodge back whoops ow ow
[170:30.43]I'm not going to... I'm done.
[170:33.84]I'm done.
[170:34.70]I'm not evocating.
[170:35.58]I'm not going to waste it right now.
[170:37.16]So, good luck.
[170:41.14]Good luck.
[170:41.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:43.00]Don't pull it.
[170:44.02]I wish I could tag out my shaman right now in this dungeon and get on my druid because I feel like resto healing this would be way better than resto healing this.
[170:54.09]Resto.
[170:54.65]Okay.
[170:57.41]Okay.
[170:58.63]I'm ready.
[170:59.73]3, 2, 1, I'm pulling this boss.
[171:03.11]Get inside!
[171:10.96]Quick, get in!
[171:17.72]This might be the easiest boss in the whole game.
[171:20.68]This is the easiest encounter in all of World of Warcraft, ever.
[171:23.76]This is the worst mob they've ever made.
[171:28.84]If this was a Wildstar boss, the circle would be moving all around him.
[171:38.53]And then the floor would start falling apart underneath us.
[171:42.93]If you stood on one pad for too long it would start falling apart and then the bubble moves over the air and you can't stand anywhere.
[171:48.97]I'm done casting.
[171:49.55]And that's just the first dungeon boss.
[171:52.32]Good luck.
[172:00.68]Wait.
[172:02.76]Don't you pull her.
[172:04.59]Alright, so you're going left, right, right, or right, left, left?
[172:08.17]Uh, we'll start with the right side.
[172:11.67]Okay.
[172:13.37]I don't know what you mean by the left, left.
[172:15.09]Jerma, let me know when you're ready to pull Jerma.
[172:16.89]Alright, are we gonna hero or no?
[172:19.01]Yeah, it's gonna take us 20 minutes to get to the next boss.
[172:21.84]Alright, so look, I'm gonna pull her this way, and then I'm gonna face her the other way.
[172:25.50]So, don't stand in front.
[172:27.52]Okay.
[172:27.70]3, 2, 1, go.
[172:33.31]I did it.
[172:33.62]I hear it.
[172:34.92]That's cool.
[172:35.60]I'm glad you did.
[172:40.84]Don't stand in front of her.
[172:46.89]Don't get hit by those either.
[172:50.21]I'm being chased by this one.
[172:56.12]Are you nervous, Herja?
[172:57.30]Ow.
[172:57.44]The storm gathers!
[173:00.08]Strike now, Herja!
[173:01.13]You will pollute these halls no more!
[173:06.11]Changing direction.
[173:06.91]Get inside.
[173:13.11]Oh, don't interrupt that, please!
[173:26.51]Time to go into the conserve phase.
[173:31.17]What's our health?
[173:32.43]Uh... 35%?
[173:32.55]45.
[173:32.57]Oh, fuck.
[173:32.79]Don't get hit.
[173:35.44]Ow!
[173:58.03]Stupid kitty beware standing behind me is bad.
[173:59.82]Oh, yeah Oh, I'm out of mana
[174:23.51]Are you?
[174:23.95]Oh no.
[174:25.83]I'm dead.
[174:27.21]Ouch.
[174:30.01]You're out of mana.
[174:31.49]What's her health?
[174:32.47]Oh, she's almost dead.
[174:33.57]Attacks, you're out of range of me.
[174:35.15]There you go.
[174:35.51]Well, that's kind of part of the encounter.
[174:37.39]10 million.
[174:39.61]That is how it goes.
[174:41.35]I'm dead.
[174:41.79]Why does she keep focusing, you guys?
[174:44.03]She casts some notes each time.
[174:46.25]6 million.
[174:48.43]Oh, stay alive stealth.
[174:49.71]5 million.
[174:55.98]Four million.
[174:58.87]Three million.
[175:01.63]Oh my god, world first, come on!
[175:03.63]1.7 million!
[175:09.23]Holy shit.
[175:13.28]Uh-oh.
[175:13.44]200,000.
[175:13.46]200,000, world first!
[175:14.78]World first, we got it!
[175:15.82]My mom's calling me.
[175:17.52]She's congratulating you on the world first.
[175:22.02]I just didn't know right what happened.
[175:26.19]Could you imagine if this was actually being broadcast right now?
[175:31.61]I just like run out of mana.
[175:33.21]Thanks.
[175:33.35]I'm micro micro ninjis For your subscription you quandary dog for your subscription I
[175:56.28]And it's me three-eyed.
[175:57.96]You get three eyes thanks for your subscription.
[175:59.42]Seven months.
[175:59.68]You should try, Resto Shaman.
[176:02.12]And tell me how you avoid running out of mana.
[176:07.64]It is mythic plus six.
[176:09.30]Wait, what?
[176:12.64]No one has ever done that.
[176:13.88]I mean, I'm not supposed to be healing surging as much because that's my huge mana trainer.
[176:18.60]But everyone dies.
[176:20.30]As long as the fight goes on, you're going to run out of mana.
[176:23.48]People's health is, like, gone.
[176:27.95]Alright, let's go.
[176:29.83]Oh, she left voicemail.
[176:31.28]Hold on, guys.
[176:32.56]It's like, oh, son.
[176:34.60]I just gotta say, that world first level 6 halls of hour, plus 6.
[176:38.98]Wow.
[176:41.08]Whew.
[176:43.70]Did Jerma not loot?
[176:44.63]There is no loot in Mythic Plus encounters.
[176:47.63]This side sucks.
[176:49.29]Because this marksman right here.
[176:51.33]I'm gonna try just pulling around the corner.
[176:53.86]Okay, three minutes to kill everybody.
[176:57.43]Three minutes.
[177:00.25]Close enough.
[177:01.65]I got that first one.
[177:02.35]I'll get the second one too.
[177:05.99]I will get the second one.
[177:08.03]Aye aye.
[177:10.80]Oh, nice.
[177:11.14]She didn't jump towards the other mobs.
[177:12.30]That's good.
[177:13.16]I fixed her away.
[177:14.26]I don't know if that mattered.
[177:15.02]They're in the room healing.
[177:18.93]I already used mine.
[177:20.55]So do we.
[177:21.57]Or so do I, I guess.
[177:23.17]I'll get the next one.
[177:25.70]Let me get the next one, guys.
[177:26.86]Let me do something cool.
[177:28.82]Let me work.
[177:32.58]He even does it again.
[177:44.29]What is making that fucking noise?
[177:46.39]It's like an elephant.
[177:50.03]I think it's my pets.
[177:54.93]This is the table we wiped on last time.
[178:01.39]I'll try to fix that.
[178:04.54]I stunned them all.
[178:15.10]I got nothing.
[178:16.18]Oh.
[178:17.46]Oh.
[178:18.74]Oh.
[178:19.45]It's okay, I don't do much anyways.
[178:20.77]Don't say that.
[178:31.03]Don't release, we'll just raise you.
[178:32.21]As soon as it says I'm out of combat.
[178:39.03]I wish in combat wasn't a thing.
[178:41.96]Yeah, okay, 947.
[178:44.90]Guys, we better hurry.
[178:46.74]We're like two minutes ahead of when it was supposed to go down.
[178:50.23]No.
[178:51.75]Good, because we're gonna finish this dungeon in 54 seconds.
[178:54.53]Maybe Technical Man has paid a visit to Boston.
[178:57.34]No, Technical Man did not do shit.
[179:00.96]My mom's calling me again.
[179:02.66]Well, you better ignore her, because you need to heal me.
[179:05.32]Mother.
[179:05.62]Mother, I cannot talk to you now.
[179:09.95]She's still watching.
[179:10.69]She's like, wow, did you see that DPS German just did?
[179:13.89]Ow, what the fuck?
[179:19.59]I just died.
[179:25.51]No, Alex is lagging.
[179:27.98]It's Steve speaking.
[179:29.88]You're still here, Gemma.
[179:30.78]I'm spamming healing surge on you.
[179:33.86]Alex, get more hit points.
[179:36.82]Get more of those hit points.

[179:48.36]And then I'll res elix while you drink.
[179:50.38]That's great.
[179:50.88]I think, uh, we didn't do it.
[179:53.28]Zero.
[179:54.57]Oh.
[179:55.09]No, um, you know, whatever, they didn't see it.
[179:57.11]Nobody on the stream saw it yet.
[179:59.83]Just put, like, an overlay.
[180:01.11]Yeah, put, like, a little of it.
[180:02.95]Go on, okay, hold on.
[180:03.73]Put, like, a pizza head at it.
[180:05.39]Make, like, a number, make, like, a different number, and it doesn't tick down, but... Make it a countdown to Christmas.
[180:11.64]Where's the stopwatch?
[180:12.28]It's just gonna be, like, 50 days, however long Christmas is.
[180:15.08]Pax, where was you?
[180:17.84]Why is this top watch?
[180:18.64]Oh, there it is down here.
[180:22.12]Block past these guys.
[180:23.93]Careful.
[180:25.01]We got time.
[180:32.15]See what?
[180:38.17]He's counting up.
[180:39.33]Counting up.
[180:46.49]Thanks a lot, Stilvan.
[180:49.94]For seven months.
[180:50.66]Alright, Taxi, you don't have to pull that again.
[180:56.58]I didn't pull him, okay?
[180:58.02]I know.
[180:58.98]Yes, you did.
[181:00.21]Yes, you did.
[181:01.03]Yeah, we can be on our mounts.
[181:06.79]No, I know the faster way.
[181:09.47]I remember the faster way.
[181:10.59]It wasn't that fast.
[181:11.91]Is he right?
[181:13.23]Well, we might die on these guys.
[181:15.49]Yeah, and the faster way avoids these guys.
[181:21.41]Well, we won't die if I get healed.
[181:26.24]Alright.
[181:28.78]Get hit points.
[181:30.32]Don't touch that.
[181:32.46]Don't touch that.
[181:33.58]I'm dead.
[181:37.37]You're dead?
[181:39.13]Yeah, I'm dead.
[181:39.75]Oh shit.
[181:40.49]You go from full health to instantly dead.
[181:42.83]Yeah.
[181:45.85]Well...
[181:46.94]And the time it takes me to cast one heal, you're dead.
[181:49.53]That's because Valahar Marksman double-snapshot me for 1.5 million damage.
[181:55.81]Alright, we're all dead.
[181:57.25]Just wait.
[181:57.69]Don't res yet.
[182:00.39]Alright, let's avoid these guys.
[182:01.61]I just got fucking hit for 2.6 million damage.
[182:05.05]They double-snapshot at the same time.
[182:06.61]Wait, we're at the... Do I res or no?
[182:09.26]Yes.
[182:11.50]We can take him.
[182:12.76]I mean, we whacked on the first boss five times.
[182:17.50]I'm trying to, like, catch up to Vuit so I can click on his repair.
[182:20.62]Sorry.
[182:22.95]What is your chat spamming, Jerma?
[182:24.79]What?
[182:25.17]I think it's something from, uh... No, it's from Sorcery.
[182:27.77]It's from Sorcery.
[182:29.31]No decisions are permitted.
[182:31.09]I thought it was... I thought that it was definitely Life is Strange.
[182:35.91]No, the Sorcery has rules where I can't rewind.
[182:41.18]And they're quoting something.
[182:42.11]I thought it was Fable 1.
[182:43.79]Fable?
[182:44.19]Do you need any potions?
[182:45.35]Or food?
[182:46.41]No, decision is permanent.
[182:47.76]Click the rewind button in Fable.
[183:00.04]We've only been here for, like, two and a half minutes, though, and we're doing... I didn't do it.
[183:02.59]Oh, somebody pulled.
[183:03.25]I didn't do it.
[183:04.47]I didn't do it!
[183:05.09]I didn't either.
[183:06.03]There's no way it was me.
[183:07.19]Who was it?
[183:07.63]No, it wasn't me.
[183:08.09]It's on you.
[183:09.17]Um... Oh, okay.
[183:10.09]Well, look who it is.
[183:11.57]Who was it just attacking?
[183:13.21]I... I went through the... I'm coming back through the portal.
[183:20.52]I was standing right next to that.
[183:21.36]It wasn't me.
[183:21.68]Everybody go in circle.
[183:22.78]Get in the circle.
[183:25.62]That's really weird.
[183:26.56]Oh, get in the circle.
[183:27.27]We all get in right when a fucking explosion happens.
[183:47.93]Okay.
[183:48.73]Glad I was facing that guy.
[184:00.84]Don't let her do barrage on us.
[184:03.36]It hurts.
[184:10.00]Look at that.
[184:10.32]My sick heals.
[184:10.94]170k.
[184:11.00]320k.
[184:11.04]Yeah, I'm more than half of yours.
[184:17.44]Attacks.
[184:17.84]Reroll your class.
[184:18.92]Demon Hunter is bad at tanking.
[184:21.12]I don't need you to heal.
[184:21.88]I need you to have health and not die, okay?
[184:25.63]Alright.
[184:25.99]Come on.
[184:26.27]Somebody don't touch that, you know?
[184:31.75]Let's go through the water.
[184:33.87]Watch out for the bowl.
[184:36.07]Watch out for the creamsicle bowl.
[184:38.25]Still waiting on one member of our team.
[184:41.29]Okay.
[184:41.71]Pull this one ram in front of us.
[184:44.76]Waiting on one member of our team.
[184:47.12]We've got somebody looming over us right now.
[184:48.88]We've got a drake.
[184:52.88]Just take... Get that one ram and make sure you don't pull any others.
[184:57.20]There's kind of one to the left.
[184:58.42]Big bear.
[185:00.72]Make sure you only pull this guy.
[185:03.28]Touch that.
[185:05.07]Nobody AOE.
[185:05.85]And watch out for that yak that you're backing up to.
[185:09.09]Yakety yak.
[185:10.03]Don't talk back.
[185:10.67]I said that.
[185:13.92]Uh-oh, we pulled.
[185:18.18]Get all that garbage out of sight.
[185:21.99]Or you don't go out Friday night.
[185:23.67]Oh my gosh.
[185:24.85]I died from fall damage.
[185:29.37]Fucking wiping the rain.
[185:30.47]What's up with that fucking creamsicle, yeah?
[185:42.11]Oh, more fall...
[185:48.85]I don't know we pulled two trash all right now.
[185:54.86]We walk That's like a disaster.
[185:58.42]It is everybody everybody get your water walking But don't move until you have the water walking Who doesn't want it?
[186:11.50]Let's have a good gun
[186:13.99]We can just kill these baby wolves now.
[186:17.05]It doesn't matter.
[186:17.61]We're gonna have to kill them anyways.
[186:21.65]Or no, you don't have to.
[186:23.42]Whoa, wait, what?
[186:25.62]Let's just get... Yeah, okay, let's go get half of this.
[186:29.12]Yeah.
[186:29.64]Alright, remember, don't cast any spells when he goes...
[186:36.93]Three.
[186:37.75]Two.
[186:38.79]One.
[186:38.97]No.
[186:39.31]No, no, no.
[186:39.77]I mean, like, not here, but, like, you know.
[186:41.85]What the fuck?
[186:42.53]What happened?
[186:43.17]Probably not.
[186:49.53]Don't cast.
[186:50.89]Stop it.
[186:52.33]What?
[186:53.51]I said stop casting.
[186:55.53]He's coming after her.
[186:56.45]She's jumping.
[186:57.09]He's jumping.
[187:06.95]Okay, I just heard, like, a real dog making noise.
[187:10.03]It's like... That was, like, the real Fenrir in the background.
[187:15.17]Whoa, what's he casting?
[187:16.47]Oh, that scratch really hurts.
[187:33.19]He's done.
[187:33.47]He's retreating.
[187:34.03]Really, guys?
[187:34.99]Alright, stop moving.
[187:36.39]I'm taking a healing.
[187:36.99]Alright, okay, bye.
[187:39.31]See ya.
[187:39.71]I'm drinking.
[187:41.65]Oh, you can hear him.
[187:42.31]Thanks for that sick heal.
[187:47.26]Hi, Stella.
[187:47.96]Are you trying to roleplay?
[187:49.44]Are you roleplaying World of Warcraft?
[187:53.60]God.
[187:54.18]She looks like Finneir.
[187:55.32]Hi, Stella.
[187:57.30]Hi, Stella.
[187:58.14]You make a little detail.
[187:59.62]I'm a little doggy.
[188:06.14]Alright, I'm here.
[188:07.38]Let's get this Ebonclaw Warg.
[188:10.54]Watch out, they jump really far at the ranged.
[188:13.26]How about now?
[188:13.70]Do you want a hero at this part, or no?
[188:15.82]Do we wait until we do it at Skullvolt?
[188:17.38]I don't know, it'll probably take us ten minutes to get to the next boss.
[188:20.60]Do we hero anyway?
[188:21.54]We'll just do it on Fenrir, and then we'll do it on Odin.
[188:24.26]We'll beefcake through Skullvolt.
[188:25.90]Ooh, Talos is getting smashed.
[188:29.86]So yeah, Jerma, we can hero on this boss.
[188:32.54]Do you want to do it, or should I do it?
[188:34.49]Wow, I don't know.
[188:35.15]I mean, I did the last one.
[188:35.95]What's the coin?
[188:37.85]Flash roll for it.
[188:38.97]Ice roll gets to do it.
[188:39.83]Oh, my.
[188:41.27]Oh, fuck.
[188:41.91]I don't want to win.
[188:42.64]I don't want to do it.
[188:43.70]No, that means you get to decide.
[188:44.90]Yeah.
[188:45.42]No.
[188:45.62]Talix has to do it.
[188:46.26]Not.
[188:48.94]It's me.
[188:49.26]It was me all along.
[188:50.46]Demon rage.
[188:58.29]Goodness gracious.
[189:01.69]Yeah, they cleave and they leap out.
[189:04.01]These guys hurt as much on normal mythic.
[189:08.49]I'm glad that this takes like one and a half seconds to cast this ability.
[189:14.43]My heal button.
[189:15.49]Come on, I can get out of this.
[189:16.27]I can get out of this.
[189:16.80]I can get out of this.
[189:17.26]I can get out of this.
[189:19.24]Oh, fuck you, wolves.
[189:20.68]Fuck you.
[189:25.27]Okay, everybody out.
[189:27.51]Why does... How come the only heal thing I do takes like a second and a half?
[189:32.45]People get one shot in the time that I'm casting a heal.
[189:37.48]Full Jupiter.
[189:41.40]We're still alive.
[189:42.13]That's surprising.
[189:43.35]It's almost 10 o'clock.
[189:51.81]Clicks ice blocks and clicks it off.
[189:53.27]Well, I don't know.
[189:54.87]I figured maybe I could take the heat away for one second and insta-have it go aggro to somebody else and have them die so then I have a minute to get ready to do greater invisibility so I don't die.
[190:04.18]It's called playing very selfishly.
[190:06.54]Next time I'm being resto-truid.
[190:21.66]It's me from the casino.
[190:23.67]I was up.
[190:24.55]I was up like a couple hundred.
[190:26.67]Playing Baccarat.
[190:29.03]It's a great game.
[190:38.56]Thanks for the water, Logan.
[190:40.18]No cancel or a face palm.
[190:41.76]I don't even know what that is.
[190:46.75]I'm just lonely here by myself.
[190:48.11]Make sure you don't take any fall damage.
[190:53.63]This is such an awful transmog.
[190:55.71]Guess I'll just swim.
[190:56.67]I spent like 300 gold for this.
[191:00.77]Oh, do I?
[191:01.43]I look like I'm like level 32.
[191:02.47]I don't.
[191:03.01]Do you not see this?
[191:05.59]You need to be looking up at the sky.
[191:08.12]And jumping.
[191:09.92]I'm doing it.
[191:12.14]Get off your mount.
[191:14.08]Really?
[191:14.36]Oh, my mount's broken.
[191:19.22]Is it like a really fat tall mount?
[191:21.48]Same one as mine, it's a different color.
[191:23.56]That's a raptor.
[191:25.74]Uh.
[191:25.94]Alright.
[191:26.22]Go!
[191:26.40]Are we ready?
[191:28.36]Three, two, one, go.
[191:29.54]Alright, this time, be careful, don't screw it up.
[191:34.98]Oh yeah.
[191:37.88]Ow, ow!
[191:38.94]Ooh!
[191:40.32]Ow, shit!
[191:42.28]I'm dead.
[191:42.86]What the fuck happened?
[191:45.32]I think you guys need to be a lot closer.
[191:48.75]When they leap away, then they come back and they insta-kill me.
[191:56.74]No, we can't.
[191:59.12]These guys just one-shot.
[192:00.06]Let's take a look at the recap.
[192:04.12]I see the recap.
[192:04.98]Talix did no healing.
[192:06.20]Yeah, because I was alive for five seconds.
[192:09.58]I didn't have time to build my energy.
[192:15.74]I found it, guys.
[192:17.65]I was dead immediately.
[192:18.65]Well, it's only... We've been here for 11 minutes.
[192:20.07]It's fine.
[192:23.87]Oh, my God.
[192:24.93]Can we hero on these wolves?
[192:26.19]I just see that.
[192:27.75]Can we hero the wolves?
[192:35.34]Am I gonna do another Wonderbook game?
[192:37.58]Well, uh, there's no more exist.
[192:40.20]I did them all.
[192:41.28]There's only one more that exists.
[192:43.89]And it's like a children's story.
[192:45.33]It's not even like a game.
[192:47.87]So, they're all pretty much done at this point.
[192:51.09]Raid sucks.
[192:51.83]Are you guys ready to hero on the wolves?
[192:55.48]Because we definitely can kill Fenrir without a problem at all.
[192:58.14]I'm just gonna pop my two 3-minute cooldowns on the wolves.
[193:01.81]We'll win.
[193:03.45]And then die to the boss, but it won't matter.
[193:05.89]Yeah, that was also with my physical mitigation.
[193:08.41]Somebody said that we should hex one of these wolves.
[193:13.56]I don't have hex.
[193:15.06]I mean, I can polymorph one.
[193:17.06]Can you polymorph beasts?
[193:18.18]I guess, yeah.
[193:19.46]I don't even know how his own class works.
[193:21.88]I don't even know what they can do to beasts.
[193:23.76]What a fucking smart guy.
[193:28.64]I'll polymorph one and you trap one.
[193:33.55]You sap trap one.
[193:42.23]Do some shitty Wii games.
[193:43.85]You know, that's not a bad idea.
[193:45.11]That'd be kind of fun.
[193:50.26]I want to play Wii Tennis.
[193:52.34]Alright, I'm going to follow him up with one all the way in the back.
[193:56.46]Okay?
[193:57.82]Mm-hmm.
[193:58.50]Okay, all the way in the back left, like the left guy.
[194:00.76]Here I go.
[194:04.76]Alright, now we can just get these two idiots.
[194:06.80]No, hold on.
[194:16.11]What are we holding on to?
[194:21.35]Just hold on.
[194:23.83]Halfway.
[194:24.71]We got each other.
[194:30.65]That's no lie.
[194:45.27]Hey, look, it was a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[194:49.66]Hey, look at that.
[194:51.34]Goddamn.
[194:51.64]The joke wouldn't have worked if you'd, like, glyphed Polymorph to any other animal.
[194:59.70]Is that how it works?
[195:00.54]Or just pick a random animal?
[195:01.94]I think if you have, like, the glyph, you just learn it from somebody.
[195:07.17]Are we heroing Fenrir?
[195:09.17]Yes.
[195:09.77]Okay.
[195:10.13]Yes, we are.
[195:11.79]Alright.
[195:12.85]Alrighty.
[195:14.55]I'm gonna call my mom back real quick.
[195:16.02]Just kidding.
[195:16.98]Ready?
[195:17.44]I'm ready.
[195:19.58]Three, two, one, go!
[195:20.84]Go up!
[195:21.36]Don't use your cooldowns too quick, Brent.
[195:28.06]It only gets worse as time goes on.
[195:30.40]Save in my big cooldowns.
[195:32.32]He has, like, a stacking bleed all the time.
[195:34.04]Ow.
[195:51.39]I'm gonna... pull down and ban him.
[195:55.65]Oh no.
[195:56.07]Oh, he went too far away.
[196:12.10]Oh no.
[196:12.94]Alright, everybody stay on top of each other.
[196:18.36]That says move away from others, don't listen.
[196:24.68]Oh, that hurts.
[196:27.48]That hurts a lot.
[196:41.83]You have been my trust.
[196:45.05]Long laugh.
[196:47.87]It comes up and he's just sleeping.
[196:50.61]comes up, he's like, what?
[196:52.81]What?
[196:54.05]Oh, right.
[196:54.55]How long ago?
[196:56.29]I thought you guys canceled.
[196:57.21]He forgot people were in there.
[196:58.69]I thought you guys dropped group.
[197:00.13]Oh, no.
[197:00.53]You're still here.
[197:01.07]Holy shit.
[197:03.15]Well, you've earned my speed boost, whatever the hell this is called.
[197:06.07]I forgot what it was.
[197:07.67]You've earned it.
[197:09.17]Come and face, Scovald.
[197:14.59]The past was already written.
[197:15.85]The ink is dry, Scovald.
[197:24.24]Hey, thanks a lot.
[197:25.44]OG Tortilla.
[197:26.76]Tortilla.
[197:27.88]For eight months.
[197:28.36]What's up, my dudes?
[197:29.12]Hey, how are ya?
[197:36.25]These vanquishers have already done that thing, Scovold.
[197:39.27]Scovold.
[197:48.98]To the victor call the spoils.
[197:52.07]Just dragging them out of my fucking range, Italics.
[197:55.47]We could die on these guys.
[197:56.33]You're supposed to drag them in here, right?
[197:57.51]Idiot!
[197:57.67]Oh, do we need to hear on these guys, too?
[197:59.71]Hero?
[198:00.29]Oh, that charge pulse.
[198:01.77]Huh?
[198:04.15]What?
[198:04.35]Why are we freaking out?
[198:06.13]These, because if we get hit by double charge pulse, we're screwed.
[198:09.11]Especially when they're enraging.
[198:12.58]Oh, goodness.
[198:26.14]oh god here it is they're trying to be melee with a speed boost on these guys is the worst yeah I can imagine how awful that is I'm just running around I don't know why my emergency just popped I didn't I don't think I was even close to dying I don't know it's one it's the raging like
[198:53.70]They have big nuke abilities and when they're raging it's doubled, it's... ouchy.
[198:59.62]Look at the... look at the fuckin' dinosaur.
[199:02.86]They look really stupid.
[199:06.69]Okay, that looks like somebody's holding it and, like, playing with a little toy, like, making it bounce, like, come on, let's go, I'm gonna play with my toy!
[199:12.81]You're clicking it around with your hand.
[199:15.93]Ridiculous.
[199:17.31]Well, if you do travel form, you don't turn into a light, you're just a stag with, like, a rocket up his ass.
[199:24.52]All right, what's the... Are we the reason we do it?
[199:29.28]Uh, no.
[199:31.54]Oh, I need to repair.
[199:35.16]Let's repair.
[199:36.04]Well, my durability is too low, so we can't get on the mountain unless we go all the way down, I think.
[199:41.90]Oh, no, jeez.
[199:43.28]Don't worry, we'll just repair when we die next.
[199:49.37]Uh, German Jeeves.
[199:50.77]Not too late.
[199:51.45]King Tor, King Bjorn.
[199:53.37]Tor Bjorn, guys.
[199:53.99]That's an Overwatch reference if you don't know.
[199:56.77]So, do we just don't give a shit about the ad that comes out?
[200:00.92]Probably not.
[200:01.76]Do we just burn?
[200:05.14]Yeah.
[200:09.04]God, I can't buy an Arcane Missile.
[200:23.28]Ooh, that was juicy.
[200:24.10]That was juicy.
[200:24.58]Alright, he's raging.
[200:34.53]This could be tough when two of them come out.
[200:36.53]Yeah, well... I mean, we'll just pop, uh... Hero?
[200:40.07]Yeah.
[200:40.29]Oh, we gotta fight on this crap.
[200:42.30]What's this guy do?
[200:45.34]I don't know.
[200:46.96]Wicked Dagger.
[200:47.60]Basically nothing.
[200:52.76]Oh, you can't polymorph those guys, can you?
[201:05.71]They're undead.
[201:06.93]No.
[201:08.67]They are undead.
[201:11.71]Oh.
[201:18.59]Oh!
[201:20.23]That just almost instantly killed me.
[201:22.45]That was his Raging Dagger.
[201:31.61]Alright, this is actually going to be tough.
[201:34.63]This is where... We will focus one.
[201:37.20]Are we focusing?
[201:39.34]Haldor.
[201:40.64]One on the right.
[201:41.68]But interrupt the guy on the left's yell whenever he casts.
[201:46.38]Okay, I'll get the first two.
[201:47.80]I can't bounce him, so I'll get the first one.
[201:49.28]Yeah.
[201:50.82]Let's go.
[201:53.48]But focus the guy on the right.
[201:55.72]Good luck, gents.
[201:57.30]And lady.
[201:59.28]Good luck.
[202:02.12]What's the move called?
[202:03.92]Unruly Yell.
[202:07.65]There it is.
[202:11.01]Look at this healing for a second.
[202:14.71]I'd say just let that thing walk in, because the heal is not really... ...concerned.
[202:21.99]This is gonna start hurting real soon, though.
[202:24.37]I don't know any interrupts.
[202:25.13]That's not good.
[202:26.82]Ready to pump my two three minute cooldowns?
[202:28.22]Now it's gonna hurt.
[202:37.86]Almost have a good move.
[202:41.03]Almost.
[202:42.19]Oh, nice.
[202:42.73]Did I just get interrupted?
[202:44.01]That's weird.
[202:47.33]Lag!
[202:49.37]Watch out, King Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
[202:52.85]I'm out of mana, and I'm not going to advocate, because that would be a waste.
[202:56.69]We can actually drag this guy away from the mob that tries to walk to it, if... like... I don't think it's that big a deal.
[203:06.12]It's not.
[203:09.82]Not worth me dying over anyway, which I will do if I keep having to move.
[203:12.10]Actually, I can just... I can root it with disable.
[203:17.61]Oh no, here comes Scovold.
[203:20.47]Alright, we're almost there.
[203:23.77]We've almost done it.
[203:25.07]If they cannot take it in death, then they will release it in death.
[203:32.92]The vanquishers have already done that shit, Scovold.
[203:35.24]No, I too have proved my worth, Odin.
[203:44.01]What exactly has he done?
[203:46.47]We've killed three, like, holy god powers.
[203:50.29]What did he do?
[203:51.25]He just walked in behind us and was like, no.
[203:54.35]Pfft.
[203:55.53]Me.
[203:57.10]Don't pull yet.
[203:57.76]I'm losing all my charges.
[203:58.94]I hate this game.
[203:59.80]If these false champions will not yield the ages by choice, then they will surrender it in death.
[204:15.73]Get him!
[204:16.15]Alright, you can do it.
[204:18.14]You can pull whenever you want.
[204:20.80]Get him.
[204:21.36]Don't have done that shit, Scovold.
[204:27.14]I've already done that shit, Scovold!
[204:29.92]As is there right!
[204:33.08]Behind you.
[204:35.50]Oh, I didn't know where you were!
[204:38.72]Stupid kitty doesn't either.
[204:40.08]Oh god, stupid kitty dead.
[204:40.92]Stupid kitty down.
[204:42.40]I'm sorry.
[204:46.64]Raya But otherwise the ads will just stack on this too much but kill the ads The languages have already done it school
[205:11.93]Oh, you fucker, that hurts so bad.
[205:19.28]Wait, why don't I... How did I get the Aegis?
[205:21.70]You have the Aegis?
[205:23.44]Oh, jeez.
[205:24.10]Oh, dear lord in heaven.
[205:25.50]Ow, pain.
[205:26.12]Here it is.
[205:36.63]Where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it, where is it?
[205:40.63]It's cool, we can take it one tick.
[205:48.19]What's his health?
[205:49.95]Half.
[205:50.21]50%.
[205:50.37]Okay, I'm less than 50% mana, so there's that.
[205:56.38]Whoops, we're in the wrong way.
[206:02.32]Oh, what are you doing?
[206:03.84]What have you done?
[206:04.50]Oh, no.
[206:05.46]What have you done?
[206:08.31]We got a win.
[206:09.79]What have you done?
[206:10.51]There's too much fire.
[206:14.13]We have to move a bit.
[206:20.41]He's like, oh, he's fucking doing that shit right up my ass.
[206:27.34]Hero.
[206:27.84]Oh, my gosh.
[206:29.60]Okay, I have, like, no mana.
[206:31.40]He's still, like, full health.
[206:34.54]We could maybe do it.
[206:38.86]Shield.
[206:39.20]Oh, we don't even have it.
[206:40.28]Who has the shield?
[206:41.67]Who has the shield?
[206:42.97]Oh, my gosh.
[206:45.29]Okay.
[206:45.81]Come on, Italics.
[206:47.09]Come on.
[206:48.86]Give me the shield!
[206:50.36]He's gonna do it, he's gonna do it.
[206:54.82]Give me that shield!
[206:57.12]I'll take responsibility for that one, because I'm normally the one that picks it up.
[207:00.90]Who has the shield?
[207:03.70]It's only when we need the shield that we can sit with the shield.
[207:06.88]Why does it put us all the way back here?
[207:08.48]Okay, we're repairing.
[207:09.78]And repair.
[207:10.42]Oh yeah, repair.
[207:12.20]Oh, why did you hero?
[207:13.66]We have fucking ten minutes of exhaustion.
[207:16.45]We had a way to DPS down in the beginning, and you hero, and like, we all died.
[207:20.09]Because he was at half health, and I was at half mana, so I figured...
[207:25.47]If my math was right, we should have been able to beat that.
[207:28.64]The math might have been correct.
[207:31.34]The shield, on the other hand, was another consideration altogether.
[207:36.38]Dude, we've got plenty of time left.
[207:38.08]We can be fine.
[207:42.92]It's cool, guys.
[207:44.28]They have 26 minutes and 50 seconds left.
[207:47.82]We have to beat this within 35 minutes.
[207:50.12]We're doing pretty good.
[207:51.76]We're going to not do this in twice the amount Halls of Valor wants us.
[207:56.01]Well, it is plus six.
[207:57.79]It is plus six.
[207:58.89]I think we're overall undergayed for plus six, to be honest.
[208:02.41]I believe we are.
[208:04.81]But that doesn't mean we're not going to beat it.
[208:06.95]Oh, we will smoke this.
[208:09.34]Well, we're beyond smoking it, but we will beat it.
[208:11.61]We'll be smoking as we complete it.
[208:13.75]The singed, charred corpses past the finish line.
[208:18.51]As we burn out before Odin.
[208:20.61]Oh, God.
[208:22.35]No, Odin is... No, he's easy.
[208:26.12]Okay.
[208:27.54]As long as we get the interrupts.
[208:29.44]We will.
[208:30.40]If we beat Scovold like now, we won't have hero for Odin.
[208:34.52]Well, just take it slow.
[208:36.20]Just take it slow.
[208:39.85]We might.
[208:43.22]We have to be on top of the outfroader.
[208:45.82]I've got the Aegis.
[208:47.66]So this time... I've found... I've found the shorts, yeah.
[208:49.82]The shorts.
[208:51.30]I told you, if you say a sentence like that, Alex, you should say, I found the shorts.
[208:56.76]Wait, wait, wait, it's going.
[208:59.62]Are we, like, all ready?
[209:01.44]Okay.
[209:01.80]I found... I believe we're ready.
[209:03.24]...the shorts.
[209:04.90]Give up the Aegis or die!
[209:07.76]Shit, no fucking ACs.
[209:09.68]No ACs!
[209:18.94]We don't need to get behind that shield really well he'll deflect us from the front
[209:46.28]But it's better to spread the ad placement out.
[209:49.86]I'm getting the Aegis.
[209:54.48]I'm also lagging pretty bad.
[209:57.24]Are you?
[209:58.34]Yeah.
[209:59.09]Maybe Comcast took over my internet.
[210:01.81]Comcast has got you on the ropes now.
[210:04.01]Everybody's standing circle.
[210:06.21]Happy circle.
[210:06.87]Uh-oh, bad circle.
[210:11.27]Oh my, that's not a good circle anymore.
[210:12.51]Yeah, we can't go up for this guy.
[210:18.71]Hopefully he does another shield phase soon.
[210:20.07]I can't.
[210:21.73]I can't do this.
[210:22.37]Alright, shield time.
[210:23.47]Everybody in the shield.
[210:35.08]I'm gonna run out of mana again.
[210:36.36]Don't worry, we got an easy bit coming up.
[210:40.56]It's not that easy.
[210:48.06]The lance.
[210:51.96]Spread out for the dash thing because it hurts.
[210:54.30]I'm just staying at one.
[210:56.78]Pick up the shield.
[210:58.16]I have the shield.
[210:59.06]Great.
[210:59.38]Okay.
[210:59.96]That's fine.
[211:00.74]We know where it is.
[211:01.57]Goddamn, really?
[211:02.31]I fucking came out of that shit right when that happened.
[211:10.53]I have touch of death again.
[211:11.41]Oh my gosh.
[211:13.67]Help me.
[211:14.55]I'm trying.
[211:16.59]Are you out of mana?
[211:17.49]Oh, you are, like, pretty much out of mana.
[211:19.55]Yeah.
[211:20.31]Oof.
[211:23.75]Heal face.
[211:24.09]I'm shielding, come to me.
[211:24.89]Alright, he should die.
[211:33.44]2%.
[211:34.08]1%.
[211:34.32]I love 2% milk.
[211:38.56]I did not do very much DPS there.
[211:40.56]I'm so sorry.
[211:43.92]That's a fucking annoying fight for Caster.
[211:47.11]yes finally you did it no you're gonna wipe on me ten times I never thought I would or it'll all be worth it for that chest we get to my beard look at my beard take a look at my beard you see my beard yeah you do all right uh let's do a rotation here I'm gonna get over the first one
[212:15.35]I'm going to go pee real quick.
[212:16.53]Don't pull the boss.
[212:19.41]Do you see how much time we have left?
[212:21.19]35 minutes.
[212:22.37]We're going to have hero in a second anyways.
[212:24.81]If we're going to pop it on the runic brands, we've got to wait to pull for like two minutes.
[212:29.44]I think.
[212:30.42]I'm going to pee as we speak.
[212:32.06]Oh my god.
[212:33.10]No, no, no, no, no.
[212:34.68]No.
[212:35.52]No.
[212:36.30]No fucking way, dude.
[212:38.60]I just muted them all.
[212:40.26]He seriously was just pissing into the toilet.
[212:46.14]Are you out of your mind?
[212:47.17]Are you out of your fucking mind?
[212:50.27]Are you kidding me?
[213:00.26]That's what they joke about with you every time.
[213:03.52]Yes.
[213:05.32]Oh my god.
[213:06.26]That actually happens on stream now.
[213:13.51]That sounded like you were standing on a stool pouring a glass of water into your toilet.
[213:20.00]That was gross.
[213:27.12]No.
[213:30.56]Wait, three minutes?
[213:33.00]We have plenty of time.
[213:34.84]We can have a go.
[213:35.80]Odin doesn't kill us.
[213:37.06]I'm going to do the first interrupt.
[213:42.75]Okay.
[213:43.31]I'm ready.
[213:44.97]Let's just say if you want to pull one, wait for Hero.
[213:48.62]We'll just get Paulson, because Odin won't wipe us.
[213:51.78]We might not even need Hero, you know?
[213:54.42]He just puts us in stance.
[213:55.38]We'll be fine.
[213:56.48]Alright, let's do it.
[213:57.10]Let's get him.
[213:58.16]Dear God.
[214:01.57]I will hold nothing back!
[214:04.85]It has been ages since I faced a worthy opponent.
[214:07.97]Let the battle begin!
[214:14.02]Everybody get out.
[214:14.66]Everybody out.
[214:15.02]Alright, where is he?
[214:18.28]Where's the dude?
[214:20.04]Not up yet.
[214:21.52]Kill the add when he spawns.
[214:22.66]Kill that add.
[214:22.98]Alright, I will get the first one.
[214:24.88]Nobody do it.
[214:25.60]I'm gonna do it.
[214:26.90]Got it.
[214:31.52]Boo, you get the next one.
[214:33.36]Oh, gosh.
[214:35.38]Boo?
[214:35.96]Oh, Mariah's standing on things.
[214:37.86]I'm trying to get out.
[214:38.58]I was stunned.
[214:41.48]Kill him.
[214:43.22]He's dead.
[214:46.81]Here come the runes.
[214:52.27]Get on here, color.
[214:53.59]Color, color, where's my color?
[214:55.75]Wrong one.
[214:56.61]That's mine.
[214:57.01]What the?
[214:57.41]Oh god, I'm like... We can't hero.
[215:00.29]What is wrong with me?
[215:00.99]For two minutes.
[215:03.71]It actually kicked me off that rune.
[215:05.55]Yeah, I know, I was like... I've never done that before.
[215:07.45]Run away.
[215:09.45]Alright, boo, I'm gonna get the first one.
[215:11.85]Oh my gosh.
[215:12.71]I hope this is out of the circle.
[215:14.17]Why did I choose this corner?
[215:16.66]Nice.
[215:17.78]Oh, first one.
[215:18.50]I'll get it.
[215:18.80]There he is.
[215:19.62]Alright, mate.
[215:24.40]Kill him!
[215:32.75]I think I can get him with a blast.
[215:35.81]I can.
[215:42.09]Shatter the spears.
[215:42.89]Don't you fucking do that to me.
[215:47.71]Circle.
[215:48.85]Oh, I got stunned.
[215:50.03]Don't panic.
[215:53.15]That's a full heal.
[215:54.25]Oh, no.
[215:55.08]Is anyone dead?
[215:56.66]Me.
[215:58.04]And we have hero in two seconds.
[215:59.00]Can we do it?
[216:01.04]I mean, she's... Yeah, I got stunned and then it blew up on me.
[216:06.52]Hold it.
[216:07.12]He's only 5%.
[216:07.46]We might be able to do this.
[216:09.14]Until he dies?
[216:10.46]Yeah.
[216:12.01]Wait, what?
[216:13.37]We need 4% until he's dead.
[216:16.01]I'm gonna get the first one.
[216:17.13]We do need to kill that add, though, because... Oh god, I got stunned.
[216:19.87]I got the first one.
[216:21.80]You got anything, Boop?
[216:29.48]I will get this in a moment, yep.
[216:31.28]Woo!
[216:33.71]Holy spears!
[216:35.01]There's so many.
[216:36.59]Where's the vortex?
[216:37.57]He didn't do it.
[216:38.41]Is he gonna do this during the rune phase?
[216:47.44]It's a full heal don't panic brace the light All right, how much further do we have to go point two okay, we went what's he doing?
[217:04.75]Time expired what we had fucking two minutes left.
[217:06.85]Oh
[217:10.77]One hour and 22 minutes.
[217:12.35]What is he doing?
[217:13.73]Oh, don't put that on the leaderboards for us.
[217:16.53]Oh, no.
[217:18.61]Come on.
[217:18.95]What did I get?
[217:19.91]Oh, I got something.
[217:20.58]I got something.
[217:21.08]I don't know what it is.
[217:24.38]Oh, Jesus.
[217:29.58]These might be good for you, Talix.
[217:30.66]Do you need these?
[217:32.37]Remember, look at your thing so we can see it.
[217:35.03]Oh, boy.
[217:37.21]What is that?
[217:42.74]Ooh.
[217:43.96]I have that, but I'm at 840.
[217:44.72]I actually do, boo.
[217:45.77]Those are 15 eye levels above mine.
[217:52.11]A cool trinket.
[217:55.27]Aw, thanks.
[217:56.63]Well, it was a slug.
[217:58.36]I did get something.
[218:02.44]I did get some sweet loot.
[218:04.34]I'm gonna replace my 830 trinket.
[218:09.09]Push me up a whole eye level.
[218:11.49]I lose a shitload of good stats, though.
[218:13.23]All right.
[218:19.34]1,000 intellect and almost 900 mastery for 1,000 crit.
[218:25.62]Sick effect.
[218:26.80]I know, but how often is that going to happen?
[218:28.24]Is that worth it?
[218:28.98]I mean, it is.
[218:29.46]Yeah.
[218:31.34]Isn't it like a 35% chance or something?
[218:33.89]I mean, I can technically trade this.
[218:35.79]So does somebody like... Is it a lot?
[218:38.63]Does it actually happen a lot?
[218:42.93]I don't know if it has an internal cooldown.
[218:46.25]Let me look at Wild Head.
[218:48.60]What eye level is your other thing?
[218:49.64]830.
[218:49.84]It's a piece of crap, but it has... This has to be better.
[218:53.44]Yeah, but here's the thing.
[218:55.14]I don't think you can trade it if it's better.
[218:56.94]No, I can trade it.
[218:58.40]Oh, okay.
[218:59.40]There's no internal cooldown, and it doesn't break CC.
[219:02.13]Really?
[219:02.95]Procs off periodic spell damage, so Nether Tempest and Mark of Illness.
[219:06.19]I mean, I could technically, but...
[219:10.25]Get it here.
[219:10.65]I'll take it.
[219:11.39]The effect on Moonlit Prism, the effect.
[219:14.11]Yeah, it's a thousand haste.
[219:14.99]It's like my worst secondary stat.
[219:16.77]But... It's affected by Incantus Flow?
[219:20.03]What?
[219:20.47]Is it actually?
[219:21.03]Yeah.
[219:22.31]All right, what sounds more fun, Jerma?
[219:23.63]Like a thousand haste or fell meteor?
[219:27.35]Yeah, it's going on.
[219:27.95]Fuck it.
[219:30.44]Oh, I mean, the damage of it is affected by Incantus Flow.
[219:33.54]As in, it'll scale with the buff.
[219:35.30]No, I was going to say, that was weird.
[219:39.71]So, no, I guess if that happens often, then it'll be worth removing the intellect.
[219:45.49]Nice.
[219:46.29]Cool.
[219:46.89]And I actually got some good crit from that, too.
[219:50.32]You went up two high levels.
[219:51.80]I did.
[219:52.12]Amazing.
[219:55.08]Socket some int on it.
[219:55.94]Yeah, I could do that.
[220:00.56]Hey, well, that was fun.
[220:02.32]I think that dungeon cost us about 300 gold.
[220:06.38]Probably.
[220:06.88]Yeah.
[220:08.94]I'm gonna go smash a dummy and see how often this happens.
[220:12.72]You guys wanna port?
[220:13.64]Hey, I can port us out of here.
[220:14.51]Oh, yes please.
[220:15.25]Anywhere.
[220:15.87]What else?
[220:16.49]Did anybody get anything?
[220:17.11]What did you get?
[220:17.55]Cool, cruel vice grips?
[220:18.79]He gave me leather gloves.
[220:21.97]Why can't I look at the... 855.
[220:24.57]Yeah.
[220:26.21]Very nice.
[220:26.63]They're 15 higher than mine, so I'll take them.
[220:30.03]Happily.
[220:36.29]Very, very cool.
[220:43.14]So let's see how often that thing happens.
[220:47.56]I think that proves it.
[220:48.84]Heimdall, Hardest Boss, and Holder Valor.
[220:52.45]I know.
[220:52.91]No, seriously.
[220:55.05]He really is.
[220:59.19]Let's go hit a dummy and see how often it happens.
[221:06.19]But yeah, stat weight, mastery is the number one stat weight.
[221:12.59]And it might even be higher than intellect.
[221:20.24]Yeah, you want a shitload of mastery.
[221:22.18]And I dropped a lot in the last like hour.
[221:25.38]I was at like 44%.
[221:26.12]I was at 50% yesterday.
[221:30.30]Because what mastery does, Arcane's all about mana.
[221:34.72]And my mastery improves how much maximum mana I have.
[221:39.73]And, so those of you that have no idea what the hell's going on,
[221:44.61]When I cast moves, he has Arcane.
[221:46.57]I blast a target dealing 54,900 Arcane damage.
[221:50.00]Damage increased by 80% per Arcane charge.
[221:53.36]And mana cost increased by 100% per Arcane charge, right?
[221:57.64]So, there's not going to be four total.
[222:00.48]So, you want to stay at four as much as you can before you Evocate and then dump all your mana and just kind of hang out until you can do Evocation again.
[222:08.78]But mastery makes not only the damage increased better, but also my maximum mana.
[222:15.93]So the more casts I can do at max charges with more mana is super, extremely, crazily important.
[222:27.91]So you want to have as much as you possibly can have so you can just spam Arcane Blast as much as possible.
[222:41.14]So for each point of mastery, I don't know per point of mastery, but here, you'll see.
[222:47.88]So increases your maximum mana regeneration rate and maximum mana by 40%.
[222:51.85]And arcane charges increase the damage of affected spells by an additional 20%.
[222:57.57]So let's just, for instance, see this is 865 mastery.
[222:59.09]What was that at?
[222:59.67]40% maximum mana and mana regen and 20%, 20.4%.
[223:02.23]Watch this.
[223:12.85]Now let's step to 43% and almost 22%.
[223:15.91]So all of my moves just do 2% more damage now at max charges than they did before.
[223:22.70]And I get like 4% more mana.
[223:26.32]So you want to stack this shit.
[223:30.08]But we'll give it a shot.
[223:31.10]I'm going to hit a dummy for a little bit.
[223:38.25]Thank you, Mr. Seltzer, for your subscription.
[223:39.93]Welcome, dude.
[223:41.99]Let's go mash on a dummy.
[223:49.04]It's a good eye level though.
[223:50.14]I'm glad it was crit because if it wasn't crit, I would have been really mad because crit is the second most important stat behind mastery.
[223:59.26]Alright, where are the dummies in this dumb fucking mage hall?
[224:01.42]This way?
[224:01.76]I think they're this way.
[224:09.66]Is Fel Meteor 2%?
[224:10.44]Yeah, that's a good question.
[224:13.67]It could be.
[224:15.09]Let's just mash on the dummy and see what happens.
[224:20.21]Camera, what are you doing?
[224:25.66]Okay, it just happened.
[224:26.30]That's one.
[224:29.24]Happened instantly.
[224:40.30]We'll take a good look-see at the logs after like a minute.
[224:47.56]Why did I click off it?
[224:48.22]What the fuck was that?
[224:48.78]It was lagged.
[224:49.50]It was weird.
[225:02.57]So, Boo, did you say this could proc off of Net-A-Tempest?
[225:05.09]I'm not sure they can even hear me.
[225:18.41]Okay, I think it happened again We're gonna just sit here and do it for one or two evocation runs Oh, I just saw it again No rune of power?
[225:44.59]No, I don't use rune of power because I like to move around
[225:48.48]It annoys the absolute shit out of me when I can't move around in dungeons and shit.
[225:58.45]One to two hours at a dummy.
[226:09.14]Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.
[226:10.40]Alright, like another, another like two minutes.
[226:13.25]Two minutes.
[226:13.87]Hey, what's going on?
[226:15.59]Hey.
[226:21.97]I'm thinking about what I'm going to eat for dinner.
[226:26.29]Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.
[226:30.81]I've come to understand that either chicken or coffee are basically my two options.
[226:39.62]Coffee, chicken.
[226:40.32]Are you serious?
[226:41.44]Are you serious right now?
[226:42.90]What did you just say?
[226:45.66]How do I see my amounts again?
[226:51.66]Anyone?
[226:53.08]I believe it is the Shift-P Mount Journal.
[227:07.91]And fuckin' Time Warp.
[227:14.21]Come on, give me a fuckin' Arcade Missiles!
[227:15.85]What is this shit?
[227:16.89]What?
[227:18.33]Wow.
[227:22.52]Alright, how often did it happen?
[227:23.36]Let's see.
[227:24.98]Just do one more, two more, three more.
[227:26.80]Okay, okay, okay.
[227:27.66]Boink, boink, boink.
[227:30.29]Alright, let's just see.
[227:32.93]Fell meteor.
[227:36.17]3%.
[227:37.13]So it happened 15 times.
[227:40.13]That is actually really worth it.
[227:42.50]That did more than... Okay, cool.
[227:45.36]Yeah.
[227:46.06]So it's worth it.
[227:48.36]There's my 2%, there's my 3% damage that I just got 1% extra now.
[227:55.34]It can crit too, that's awesome.
[227:59.50]You know, I'm pretty upset that I didn't get loot today.
[228:02.76]Yeah.
[228:04.03]You didn't get a single thing?
[228:05.19]I didn't, no, I, I'm, I... I hate, I hate, I hate... It does AoE damage too, that's good.
[228:14.25]Oh, okay.
[228:15.67]Cool.
[228:16.52]So yeah, that's definitely worth it.
[228:17.58]There's my 2%.
[228:19.34]I want more chains.
[228:22.28]Yeah.
[228:22.90]We still have more, right?
[228:24.08]Yeah.
[228:24.90]So, what's the deal?
[228:26.34]I don't know.
[228:28.02]Help me.
[228:28.28]What's wrong with the talics?
[228:28.94]I was trying to figure out what to eat for dinner.
[228:32.20]Everyone keeps saying chicken, Cheetos, and coffee, so I figured I'd take a poll to decide who the actual winner is.
[228:39.01]It's going to be Cheetos, probably.
[228:43.20]It's really neck and neck right now between chicken and Cheetos.
[228:46.76]Thanks a lot, Crazy Bra.
[228:48.22]Crazy Bra and Krish312.
[228:51.66]Thank you, Krish312, for your eight months.
[228:54.47]And then I think I said Mr. Seltzer.
[228:55.61]Hi, Mr. Seltzer, five minutes ago.
[228:56.89]I remember that one.
[229:02.39]I'm surprised coffee is as low as it is.
[229:04.77]It's only like 14 votes behind.
[229:06.65]It could make a comeback.
[229:09.41]By the way, it's like almost 11 o'clock and the stream's still up.
[229:15.80]With our powers combined, we have kept your stream alive.
[229:23.32]I have no idea, man.
[229:24.46]Because they told me that it wasn't fixed and somebody wasn't even coming out until tomorrow afternoon.
[229:29.50]I have no idea what's going on.
[229:32.09]But this is the first time in a long time that I've been able to go for like four hours.
[229:38.70]At this time of night.
[229:41.96]It hasn't dropped at all.
[229:44.80]I don't think one frame has dropped the whole time.
[229:46.98]No.
[229:47.74]Zero frames dropped in four hours.
[229:49.34]Come on.
[229:50.14]At least one's gotta have dropped by now.
[229:52.12]No, it didn't.
[229:53.24]At least one.
[229:54.92]Come on.
[229:56.89]Another adorable boy.
[229:58.11]Thanks for subscribing, dude.
[229:59.11]He's so adorable.
[230:03.34]Meme magic?
[230:05.66]Yeah, the guy's gonna go, it's like fixed now, the guy's gonna go and try to fix it tomorrow and break it and it's gonna be fucked up again.
[230:11.78]Alright, um... Yeah, let's keep going.
[230:18.17]Are we all doing like level ones?
[230:19.41]Is like the whole fucking chat gonna do level ones and we're gonna go to Orgrimmar?
[230:23.67]If you wanna pick up a sub, I'm probably done for now.
[230:28.20]I actually do need to eat.
[230:31.06]NPM.
[230:32.06]I'll keep playing.
[230:32.78]I might get on my druid and play.
[230:34.44]I kind of want to keep streaming just because I want to see if it happens.
[230:44.42]But I'm going to use the bathroom.
[230:45.70]I'll be right back.
[230:48.30]And if anybody else is here, boo to Alex.
[230:50.34]Alex, you're taking off for now.
[230:51.66]Yeah, I'm going to get some food.
[230:53.14]So thanks.
[230:54.54]All right, well, we'll see your stream.
[230:56.88]We'll see you at Alex's stream real soon.
[231:01.49]That is the dream.
[231:02.71]Excuse me, can we please... Italics, make sure you follow Italics' stream.
[231:07.61]Exclamation Italics.
[231:09.15]Italics is going to start streaming Mythic Plus 10.
[231:12.27]Wow, every day.
[231:14.87]Absolutely not.
[231:16.65]All right, I'm going to go get some tea.
[231:21.98]All right, I will be back.
[231:23.50]Whoever's here when I get back, I'll see you when I get back.
[231:26.38]Cool.
[231:26.76]Can you stream or else I'm going to go pee again?
[231:28.52]I'm going to, don't worry.
[233:16.24]Hey.
[233:16.50]I'm back.
[233:18.60]I think I just got a... Legendary?
[233:24.35]I'd be really lucky.
[233:27.33]A secret appearance for Resto.
[233:32.41]Oh, I need to fix my transmog.
[233:33.69]The stream joke is over, right?
[233:38.01]I'm too lazy to walk to Dalaran.
[233:40.05]Even though it's right there.
[233:46.16]Uh, I don't know, I think maybe... How much longer should I stream for?
[233:51.12]I gotta let my dog out and feed him and stuff.
[233:54.04]Um... I'll just go till 11.
[233:55.74]I don't know, what can we do for like 20 minutes?
[234:02.50]Because if it hasn't happened yet, I don't think it's gonna happen.
[234:06.83]Tea, tea, tea, tea.
[234:12.21]You just got a legendary while you were eating dad's famous spaghetti?
[234:16.06]I get a hidden appearance for my Resto Druid artifact weapon.
[234:20.70]Did you?
[234:20.96]Let me see it.
[234:21.36]Where are you?
[234:23.50]Uh, in the Resto Druid area.
[234:25.50]Depleted.
[234:26.00]I have a lot of random shit in my bags.
[234:37.75]Alright, I'm gonna go fix my transmog.
[234:40.79]Go paint Roadhog again?
[234:50.58]That painting is still here.
[234:51.50]It's still sitting right there behind me.
[234:54.58]I haven't thrown it in the trash.
[234:58.66]Do we have any more?
[234:59.36]I can show you what it looks like if you want to see it.
[235:05.51]It doesn't look that good.
[235:09.75]It doesn't look good.
[235:11.33]It looks good.
[235:12.73]I don't know where you got that idea from that it doesn't look good.
[235:15.58]Didn't you just say it doesn't look good?
[235:17.34]I mean, it doesn't look that good.
[235:20.45]auction off the fine art.
[235:22.39]Alright, invite me to the group.
[235:28.48]Hold on, I'm currently fixing my transmog.
[235:38.03]I don't have that one.
[235:43.19]Welcome.
[235:44.17]Welcome.
[235:45.41]Where the hell is the...
[235:52.42]What can I do for you?
[235:55.92]What can I do for you?
[235:59.17]What's Drowned Banner?
[236:03.21]Drowned Banner.
[236:05.20]Oh, it's a fishing thing.
[236:08.92]Right beneath you.
[236:09.80]Alright, I'm done.
[236:17.05]Should I transmog this into, like, the walking stick?
[236:20.39]My cool Alaneth should just be a walking stick.
[236:28.31]Hey, do you guys like that $1,000 joke?
[236:32.17]Because that's what it was.
[236:35.57]Gold, Jerma.
[236:37.67]I say dollar.
[236:41.51]No.
[236:43.36]No, Alaneth is too cool looking.
[236:45.99]Can't handle me at my worst.
[236:49.37]Obey your thirst.
[236:49.95]Obey your thirst.
[236:52.31]Alright.
[236:53.21]Where are you?
[236:55.37]I'm standing in Dalaran waiting for you.
[236:57.97]You're not even online.
[236:58.61]Uh, yeah-huh.
[237:02.29]Who are you on?
[237:04.96]You know who I'm on.
[237:06.22]Well, uh, where's Italics?
[237:11.14]Uh, gone, maybe?
[237:12.96]He's over here hanging out.
[237:13.74]Just AFK.
[237:16.43]The walking sherbet ice cream.
[237:20.45]Yeah, the goal here is to be the bubblegum cotton candy guy.
[237:23.88]But I need one more piece of netherweave.
[237:25.54]I need the chest.
[237:28.04]The helm is just too stupid looking.
[237:29.54]I can't do it.
[237:31.06]The chest is just electric.
[237:33.42]I love it.
[237:33.82]Bam.
[237:40.37]Schedule broken?
[237:41.03]Yeah, this was a test stream to see if the internet was fixed.
[237:45.05]And Comcast told me they didn't do it, but we've been going for about four hours now at 7 to 11.
[237:52.39]And it hasn't died.
[237:53.31]I don't know.
[237:56.77]But maybe I'll just call it.
[237:59.65]Bye.
[238:02.71]It's getting late.
[238:03.41]I need to let my dog out and stuff.
[238:06.02]Might as well just get out of here before I jinx it, you know?
[238:09.90]But we'll be here tomorrow.
[238:11.34]We're not going to be playing WoW tomorrow.
[238:13.28]No World of Warcraft tomorrow.
[238:15.22]But I had a lot of fun.
[238:16.18]This was like a very fun stream for me.
[238:17.64]So I will definitely be doing this some other time in the future.
[238:20.60]And I do want to do like a mythic with subs or some like giant like 40 man sub raid when we all run into like Elwynn Forest or something.
[238:30.01]But yeah, have a good night, guys.
[238:32.59]Thanks so much for all the new subs.
[238:34.48]A lot of money was dropped in the first hour of the stream, and thank you for that.
[238:40.12]Appreciate everybody.
[238:42.30]Stream tomorrow, 7 p.m.
[238:43.86]I'll see you on the normal schedule.
[238:46.25]And I don't know, maybe I'll go back to Sorcery.
[238:48.37]We'll see what people want to do.
[238:50.03]But yeah, have a good night, guys.
[238:51.65]Thanks for sticking around.
[238:54.05]Well, I guess I'll dump these.
[238:55.15]Well, thank you a lot, Needsmeek.
[238:57.49]Thanks for the three bucks.
[238:59.42]Have a good night.
[239:00.74]Good luck.
[239:01.08]Good night.
[239:01.53]Take care of yourselves.
[239:02.79]Bye-bye.
