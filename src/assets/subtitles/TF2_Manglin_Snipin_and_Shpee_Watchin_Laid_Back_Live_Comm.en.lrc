[00:09.04]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.60]Jerma here with kind of a different video today.
[00:13.55]Well, not really different, but a little bit different than what you've been used to the last few months of the content of my channel.
[00:21.33]What is going on with this?
[00:22.62]What is going on with this guy?
[00:27.62]And what I mean by that, sorry, I was interrupted there, is this is going to be just a laid-back live commentary.
[00:32.49]I haven't done one of these in a long time, and I feel like it's kind of overdue.
[00:36.79]A lot of the stuff on my channel lately has been... Hold on, see if I can get this off.
[00:39.77]I'll pull this off.
[00:41.48]Damn it.
[00:42.62]Almost.
[00:43.14]That was close.
[00:43.72]Oh, well.
[00:44.64]But a lot of the content on my channel lately has been, like, wacky and crazy and that that's, like, that's who I am.
[00:49.70]But I also want to do more stuff like this, where I just kind of hang out, talk to you guys about anything really, and play some video games.
[00:55.32]And today we're playing TF2, playing as the Cow Mangler, as you can see.
[00:59.60]And I'm going to get that sentry gun.
[01:01.82]I'm gonna get it.
[01:03.42]I'm gonna use the strategy where you shoot it, you right-click it, and then you kill it with a shotgun.
[01:08.89]Or this guy will just Uber it.
[01:09.87]We'll see.
[01:11.37]Uh, there's a... Ooh!
[01:13.11]Ooh!
[01:14.67]Gotta kill the engineer.
[01:16.25]There we go.
[01:16.81]Okay, good, good, good.
[01:18.09]So, what?
[01:19.63]What?
[01:21.96]Looks like there could be one or two.
[01:23.86]Let's shoot that over there.
[01:25.02]Get rid of this.
[01:27.70]Bang.
[01:29.60]Yep.
[01:29.90]Alright, we're gonna try the shotgun strategy.
[01:31.30]I'm gonna try the shotgun strategy again.
[01:33.74]The Cow Mangler and then shotgun.
[01:35.66]Sentry's right around this corner.
[01:37.11]Let's see if I can do this.
[01:41.29]Where is it?
[01:41.67]I need to know where it is.
[01:42.73]There it is.
[01:43.07]Okay, here we go.
[01:43.61]Ready?
[01:43.75]Ready?
[01:45.09]Shotgun strat.
[01:48.89]Three, four, there it is!
[01:51.56]Aw, at least I got the sentry gun.
[01:54.42]So it works, it does work.
[01:56.52]It's fun to do as well, sometimes if you're running straight at a sentry like that, and you charge up the cow mango and you sprint at it, it's pretty intense, especially if there's an engineer nearby, it's really fun.
[02:09.13]What?
[02:09.55]That didn't even hit him with anything.
[02:13.02]Knew he was low on health because he wouldn't have ran away.
[02:14.73]Hi.
[02:15.29]Oh, he got me.
[02:29.58]Which one am I going to use?
[02:31.70]Should I use a knife?
[02:32.32]Should I use a gun?
[02:32.78]Should I use a knife?
[02:33.44]Should I use a gun?
[02:34.00]Knife?
[02:34.38]Gun?
[02:34.80]Knife?
[02:35.48]Gun?
[02:36.08]Knife?
[02:36.30]I don't know.
[02:37.04]Gun?
[02:37.38]Knife?
[02:41.23]Um... Oh boy.
[02:42.99]This is what I'm talking about here.
[02:44.29]This is what I'm talking about.
[02:45.63]That's what I want.
[02:47.49]Come on spy, do your work!
[02:49.37]Oh yeah, that's what we call teamwork.
[02:52.45]That was teamwork, for sure.
[02:55.11]I wouldn't have gotten there in time.
[02:56.71]And that spy did a hell of a lot of good things.
[03:00.63]And this spy... Is being a real son of a bitch.
[03:08.44]Be careful.
[03:10.54]Get full health.
[03:11.52]Let me get full health and full mana.
[03:18.60]You know, a lot of people forget.
[03:19.59]This is a window.
[03:21.83]I always forget that.
[03:23.79]I always think it's like, oh, I can only see them in one place.
[03:26.31]That means they can only come from one place.
[03:27.63]There's a window right there that you can shoot through.
[03:32.55]People are, like, hiding.
[03:35.75]Damn.
[03:36.11]Damn.
[03:39.15]Oh, boy.
[03:42.65]There we go.
[03:44.47]Keep it rolling, boys.
[03:45.35]Keep it rolling.
[03:46.79]That's what I like to see.
[03:47.65]We're going to win?
[03:51.73]I think we're actually going to do it.
[03:57.02]I missed it.
[03:57.94]It's okay.
[04:01.62]Distracted.
[04:03.94]Distraction.
[04:06.32]Nice job.
[04:14.74]Need some help here.
[04:18.12]There's a sniper up there.
[04:18.98]I know he's there.
[04:23.86]What?
[04:24.88]What?
[04:30.60]What just happened?
[04:33.99]He was like on an invisible platform.
[04:38.47]You guys saw that.
[04:41.11]Was that just like ultra lag for that guy?
[04:44.25]And what is this guy doing?
[04:48.34]There's a spy.
[04:49.02]I need to see that spy.
[04:51.34]Hold on.
[04:51.78]I don't even care if I'm burning.
[04:53.38]That spy.
[04:55.64]Where'd he go?
[04:57.30]He's over here somewhere.
[04:59.84]No!
[05:00.20]No!
[05:00.44]Don't kill him!
[05:06.85]Dude, that was... Somebody play the Benny Hill theme song.
[05:10.25]Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[05:14.71]That was amazing.
[05:16.81]I loved every single second of that.
[05:19.85]There's another sniper on this team that's really good.
[05:23.89]I'm trying to find him, because I know he's going to kill me over and over again.
[05:26.26]Oh!
[05:29.02]Get!
[05:29.86]Please!
[05:31.06]Thank you!
[05:33.56]Is that him?
[05:33.98]That's him.
[05:35.26]He's good.
[05:35.66]This guy's good.
[05:37.15]This guy knows what he's doing.
[05:38.01]Ooh!
[05:42.69]Refill.
[05:44.33]Get a little bit of a refill.
[05:46.97]That guy was standing in the same spot again.
[05:48.47]And his buddy.
[05:51.19]Got your bolt.
[05:52.61]Be careful next time.
[05:53.73]Watch yourself.
[05:55.69]Missed that headshot.
[05:57.29]Don't know how.
[05:58.78]That guy burned.
[06:01.96]I could probably take out this sentry gun.
[06:03.06]I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[06:06.14]I could... Oh, shit!
[06:15.35]We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[06:18.40]We have seven snipers.
[06:22.76]That's a little ridiculous.
[06:26.18]That is just a little bit ridiculous.
[06:31.30]You know, I always thought that when Shpee became an adult spy, they kind of grew up a little bit and stopped acting kind of like crazy.
[06:43.27]I don't think that's true anymore.
[06:48.33]I always like disguising as an engineer.
[06:49.61]I'm not entirely sure why.
[06:52.87]Oh, that's a... Another one?
[06:56.50]What the hell is going on?
[07:03.18]What does he do?
[07:03.96]What is this guy doing?
[07:06.26]He was just crouching in the middle.
[07:11.08]This guy is great.
[07:16.36]That was a good, like, strat.
[07:19.85]Just, like, crouch in the middle.
[07:22.11]Oh, dear.
[07:26.73]Oh, it's your toast.
[07:28.37]I'm gonna get you now.
[07:30.47]No, I'm not.
[07:32.33]That just scared the hell out of me.
[07:33.25]That whole group of people, I got, like, stage fright.
[07:41.76]Get on the cart.
[07:42.44]Get on the cart.
[07:45.40]Get on the cart.
[07:47.15]We need to get on the cart.
[07:49.69]So badly.
[07:51.55]They have so many defenses, like, we have to get on here.
[07:54.47]There's like a thousand different defenses.
[07:59.61]And he's dead.
[08:00.27]Nice job.
[08:00.53]Alright, well, that's probably going to wrap it up here, guys.
[08:03.70]This is the last life.
[08:04.80]This will be the last life.
[08:07.02]Shit, I didn't time that right.
[08:10.58]Wee!
[08:13.91]Get me away from you guys.
[08:16.19]Nudist guys.
[08:20.05]Alright, well, sorry.
[08:20.77]I was just talking and I lost my train of thought because of that nonsense.
[08:24.33]But I'll see you guys all next time.
[08:25.71]Thank you so much for watching.
[08:26.51]Take care, everybody, of course.
[08:28.32]And I'll see you all next time.
[08:34.58]I don't know when to go for the stab.
[08:38.24]How did I get that?
[08:39.64]That was a chaos stab if I've ever seen one.
