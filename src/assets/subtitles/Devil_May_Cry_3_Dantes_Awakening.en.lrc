[00:32.28]I like this comment.
[00:33.00]Where is this fucking guy?
[00:36.21]I'm right here.
[00:38.03]What's going on?
[00:38.61]How you doing?
[00:47.89]Time to start meowing.
[00:51.85]I'm good.
[00:56.59]I'm good.
[00:58.37]That's the quickest way to be like, no.
[01:01.54]No, I'm not doing that.
[01:03.02]I'm good.
[01:04.48]Let me tweet.
[01:15.57]So you probably saw the title.
[01:18.31]Maybe you were here in the pre-stream.
[01:21.48]But we're going to go over very briefly what happened in the chat.
[01:28.39]Because I know that there are like 15 games in this series.
[01:32.95]And I'm starting with Devil May Cry 3.
[01:34.63]There's a big debate in pre-stream.
[01:38.35]The council has chosen.
[01:40.45]They actually chose 5, but I vetoed it.
[01:49.54]Turned out that starting with 3 was considered by most people the right call.
[01:57.08]the the smart thing to do three and five three and five are one storyline and then one two one and two are the same story or one two four and then three five is it is it work like Star Wars like how does this work
[02:21.73]It's four and five.
[02:23.67]It goes three, one, two, four, five.
[02:27.29]Oh.
[02:28.99]Okay.
[02:31.67]Well, yeah, I was thinking, do I start with one or do I start with three?
[02:36.72]I was told start with three.
[02:38.86]I don't know how to do this shit anymore.
[02:42.34]It's like if you've never seen Star Wars, like how would you?
[02:46.54]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[02:47.86]This is a better idea.
[02:49.20]How would you tell people to start Resident Evil?
[02:52.11]We're going to talk about this.
[02:53.87]Resident Evil.
[02:55.25]Resident Evil.
[02:57.51]Do you have people start with the new ones?
[03:00.41]Do you start with 7, 8?
[03:02.18]Do the whole Ethan story?
[03:04.70]Do you start at 1?
[03:05.86]I don't know if I would recommend starting at 1.
[03:07.48]Are you even into that?
[03:11.22]Would you do 7, 8 then?
[03:12.80]1, 2, remake 2?
[03:16.02]Or 1, 2 normally?
[03:16.94]There's a couple of remakes in Devil May Cry, right?
[03:22.13]And do you even put, uh, the other Resident Evil games on that list?
[03:27.88]It's like, it's Code Veronica on that list, for instance.
[03:30.78]In, like, the play 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[03:32.52]6, 7, 8.
[03:36.04]Yes or no?
[03:36.92]That's why it gets tricky.
[03:39.72]There are five games in this series, and there's multiple timelines and storylines.
[03:44.45]So I get it.
[03:45.21]It's tough.
[03:46.47]So we're starting with three.
[03:51.65]You guys ready?
[03:53.45]Devil make... I didn't even do my tweet.
[03:56.65]Uh, today's gonna be a chill stream.
[03:59.87]Just wanna hang out and play.
[04:01.61]Relax.
[04:03.05]And have a nice evening together.
[04:04.17]Is this game hard?
[04:08.41]Are these games hard or are they just, like, fun?
[04:19.83]Not really.
[04:20.23]The gameplay is the real content.
[04:24.68]Yeah, let's just hang out.
[04:27.22]Somebody said, wait, Code Veronica is shit.
[04:32.71]Resident Evil, I am, and look, I am a Resident Evil streamer.
[04:38.63]I am.
[04:40.07]I play, I've played all the Resident Evil games, all of them.
[04:43.77]But I will agree that Resident Evil is an interesting franchise because they're one of the only franchises that has that main series, which is phenomenal.
[04:54.46]And then a ton of kind of bargain bin straight to DVD movies that they also have.
[05:06.94]I swear, I see a Resident Evil property come out every couple of years, and I just feel like it's right into the bargain bin.
[05:17.60]Is that accurate?
[05:23.41]And then they got Resident Evil 4 Remake comes out.
[05:25.73]One of the best games I've played.
[05:26.73]I mean, that's absolutely one of the best games I've played this year, without a doubt.
[05:32.41]Resident Evil 2's remake.
[05:34.63]Favorite game of the fucking whole year when it came out.
[05:37.71]Resident Evil 7 and 8.
[05:39.61]I really liked those.
[05:40.51]I thought they were good.
[05:45.63]Why are you stalling?
[05:47.25]There's no stalling.
[05:48.49]I'm just hanging out.
[05:51.85]You've played like four games this year?
[05:54.49]No.
[05:54.93]How many games have I played this year?
[05:56.25]I want to know.
[05:57.59]How many games have I played this year on stream?
[06:03.89]Alright, let me... I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a bet.
[06:07.80]Do you think I have played more than 15 games this year?
[06:12.84]Yes, I have.
[06:15.68]Do you think it's... Alright, we need to... Nobody look yet.
[06:18.02]We need to vote first.
[06:18.72]A one minute poll.
[06:19.80]Quick, before people... It's going to take like five minutes to do this research.
[06:22.38]So we need to pull right now.
[06:24.16]Have I played more than 20 games this year?
[06:31.68]Have I played more than 20 games this year?
[06:33.14]Yes or no?
[06:35.48]It's literally a one-minute poll going up right now.
[06:39.48]Have I played more than 20 games since January 1st, 2023?
[06:42.44]20 different individual games.
[06:50.39]No shot.
[06:52.85]15 yes, 20 no.
[06:54.07]Well, let's find out.
[06:55.61]Alright, so there's a lot of people that don't think I've... Are you serious?
[06:58.62]How many times have I streamed this year?
[07:06.13]Irma, shut the fuck up.
[07:07.95]FNAF trailer.
[07:09.27]What?
[07:13.23]Alright, alright, alright.
[07:14.09]So, 70% of you think I have not played 20 different video games this year.
[07:19.55]How many is it?
[07:20.59]Somebody's doing it right now.
[07:22.11]Somebody was already on it.
[07:25.93]Jesus, sorry.
[07:27.29]This is not the Switch version.
[07:28.49]This is the PC version on Steam.
[07:30.79]Part of the HD collection.
[07:34.20]You've played 19 games this year.
[07:36.46]No.
[07:38.60]That's not true.
[07:42.54]And do we count the Xbox and PlayStation Nights, where I've played like 40 games in three nights?
[07:50.97]Do those count?
[07:52.25]I don't think those count.
[07:54.61]I think those are all part of one collective kind of group of game, right?
[07:58.45]I don't think those count.
[08:00.73]I'm talking like, it's a stream, it's an individual stream of this game that I'm playing, regardless if I play it more than once.
[08:08.35]Like, how many actual individual games have come out that were not part of a, I'm gonna play this Xbox game for 15 minutes and move on.
[08:17.30]Is it actually 19?
[08:17.94]It says 31.
[08:20.02]31? 31?
[08:28.83]Let's go.
[08:32.25]Yeah.
[08:32.77]31.
[08:34.69]I've played 31 games in 2023.
[08:38.03]Is this the fifth month?
[08:42.80]What is that per month?
[08:44.34]That's a lot.
[08:47.16]That's a lot.
[08:49.16]31 divided by... Hey, that's five games a month.
[08:58.51]I've played five games a month on average.
[09:01.71]Five different games a month.
[09:09.97]It's six games a month.
[09:12.37]Whatever.
[09:15.47]That's fake?
[09:19.46]One per week?
[09:20.52]Yeah!
[09:21.54]What's wrong with that?
[09:23.22]Generous math.
[09:24.02]I'm good.
[09:28.64]Watch the FNAF trailer.
[09:30.99]I'll tell you, I already know what happens in the FNAF trailer.
[09:33.21]It's going to start on a close-up of a phone.
[09:35.01]It's going to be pitch black.
[09:38.43]And you're going to hear a phone ringing.
[09:40.61]And it's going to go like... And then it's going to fade to black, and then white text is going to show up.
[09:51.54]You remember taking the first call.
[09:55.92]Back on the phone.
[09:57.26]And we're very close, by the way.
[09:58.60]We're literally zoomed in on the receiver.
[10:07.57]And then it fades out again.
[10:08.91]White text.
[10:10.31]And then it fades in.
[10:11.09]We're in an office.
[10:18.04]And it's some fucking A-list celebrity is on the phone.
[10:21.65]And they're doing the, hello, hello, hello.
[10:24.77]And we're talking like an S-tier celebrity.
[10:28.47]I don't know who it would be.
[10:32.20]Like, holy shit, are you kidding me?
[10:35.66]It's Chris Pratt.
[10:37.00]He's the hello guy, right?
[10:38.50]It's going to be an A-list celebrity.
[10:44.45]None of this happens.
[10:51.27]I don't want to watch the FNAF trailer.
[10:54.48]I will privately right now watch the first 10 seconds of the FNAF trailer.
[10:59.94]And I'll let you know my thoughts.
[11:00.80]Alright, here we go.
[11:05.70]I'm privately going to watch it on my own right here.
[11:08.62]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[11:09.92]Here it comes.
[11:10.36]Okay, here we go.
[11:16.47]Alright.
[11:20.59]Are you tired of having the same old backyard birthday party for your child every year?
[11:29.01]So I was wrong.
[11:30.01]I was very wrong.
[11:31.27]It should have been zoom in on the phone.
[11:33.83]Pitch black.
[11:35.23]You were there for the first phone call.
[11:38.76]Oh, it would have hit so much harder.
[11:41.20]That would be so shit.
[11:52.21]Fake trailer?
[11:52.95]Wait, that's not even the real trailer?
[11:58.17]Wait, what?
[12:02.18]This is the official one?
[12:03.26]Alright.
[12:19.56]Show it?
[12:21.18]I have to press, like, two extra buttons to show it.
[12:23.48]Nah.
[12:28.32]Alright, fine.
[12:29.10]We'll watch it.
[12:29.56]Can I, can I, can I, no, I can watch this, right?
[12:32.93]It's a fucking trailer.
[12:41.73]Alright, let's watch it.
[12:42.41]Alright, let's watch it, let's watch it.
[12:44.97]Spoilers, it's the trailer for the movie!
[12:48.10]We're gonna watch the trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's right now.
[12:50.46]Okay?
[12:52.40]Because we care so much about this, apparently.
[13:05.75]Five Nights at Freddy's.
[13:11.99]Alright, I'll give you my thoughts.
[13:19.80]Show your face.
[13:20.72]No, I can't.
[13:21.99]I just can't today.
[13:24.39]I just can't today.
[13:25.35]Alright.
[13:25.91]Hold on.
[13:26.17]You just messed with me.
[13:26.93]Alright.
[13:31.79]Let's see how this is.
[13:34.65]It's like 40 seconds long.
[13:37.11]Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria.
[13:39.85]Where fantasy and fun come to life.
[13:42.55]Hit it, guys.
[13:47.15]If you're watching this video...
[13:50.43]It means you've been selected as Freddy's newest security guard.
[13:54.18]Hello?
[14:00.04]Hello?
[14:01.76]We're going to have so much fun together.
[14:27.78]I mean, it's just... I don't know.
[14:33.21]I mean, if it's a 40-second trailer, I don't know.
[14:35.27]I can't tell from what's going on here.
[14:36.87]I mean, is it going to... I don't know.
[14:42.33]Is it like a good movie?
[14:44.52]I don't know.
[14:44.88]I haven't seen it.
[14:58.80]They didn't do the trailer that I wanted, though.
[15:01.50]You're stalling so bad.
[15:03.72]I'm not even stalling.
[15:04.84]It's been 15 minutes.
[15:08.34]We just watched the Five Nights at Freddy's theatrical trailer.
[15:11.82]Is that stalling or is that, wow, current thing to talk about?
[15:20.40]We just installed this.
[15:27.15]Okay.
[15:28.47]No more stalling.
[15:29.23]I'm ready.
[15:33.84]You couldn't give a rat's ass about Five Nights at Freddy's?
[15:39.48]I mean, okay, there's gonna be... I feel like we already know the whole thing.
[15:46.78]Five Nights at Freddy's has pretty... very elaborate lore.
[15:51.60]I'm not concerned about runtime.
[15:53.62]Why am I even giving you my thoughts on this?
[15:57.29]Alright, thankfully Devil May Cry.
[16:03.87]Turn this up.
[16:04.73]Alright, I said Five Nights at Freddy's 3.
[16:07.28]That's what we're doing tonight.
[16:12.44]Let's go.
[16:14.40]What a centrist take.
[16:16.48]I'm not going to see that movie.
[16:18.94]Can I tell you?
[16:19.63]I can tell you that, right?
[16:20.75]I'm not going to see Five Nights at Freddy's.
[16:24.09]I'm not going to see it.
[16:25.41]I won't watch it ever.
[16:27.88]This is never happening.
[16:28.88]I'm just telling you that I'm not going to see the movie.
[16:31.68]Is it going to be fine?
[16:32.74]Maybe it'll be cool.
[16:33.42]Maybe you'll like it.
[16:34.98]I probably won't watch it.
[16:35.82]Because I still haven't even seen the Mario movie.
[16:42.06]Do you think I'm going to be rushing to the theater to go see Five Nights at Freddy's?
[16:46.40]I still have to... What does this mean?
[16:52.94]That's really fucked up, dude.
[16:56.06]You're a lazy movie watcher.
[16:59.08]Alright, what does this mean?
[17:00.30]Gold or yellow?
[17:01.20]What does it mean?
[17:05.94]Gold is continue.
[17:06.92]Yellow is restart level.
[17:09.93]I'm going to go with this one then.
[17:15.39]I like that a lot.
[17:17.05]I'm a big fan of that.
[17:19.72]Go on.
[17:22.44]You've heard of it, haven't you?
[17:24.38]The legend of Sparda?
[17:26.86]When I was young, my father would tell me stories about it.
[17:30.96]Long ago, in ancient times, a demon rebelled against his own kind for the sake of the human race.
[17:38.75]With his sword, he shut the portal to the demonic realm and sealed the evil entities off from our human world.
[17:46.68]But since he was a demon himself, his power was also trapped on the other side.
[17:52.16]I keep thinking of some celebrity doing the, hello!
[17:59.12]Oh, and it's got to be a soundtrack by Danny Elfman.
[18:03.92]You know what I mean?
[18:04.70]You were there for the first call.
[18:10.63]Give me the reins.
[18:11.61]I'll fucking make it happen.
[18:29.24]It seemed as if they derived some sort of twisted pleasure from this brotherly fighting But in the end
[19:02.74]Yeah?
[19:04.00]See, they get it.
[19:25.17]They know how- Look at this!
[19:26.65]They knew what they were doing.
[19:27.87]They know how to make fucking media.
[19:30.61]Close up on the fucking phone.
[19:32.35]Black.
[19:32.99]Pitch black coming up from black.
[19:36.35]We're on the same wavelength.
[19:43.02]Go.
[19:43.14]It's a little quiet.
[19:45.06]I'll turn it up in a minute.
[20:03.57]You a customer, too?
[20:07.45]Well, if you want to use the bathroom, help yourself.
[20:11.94]The toilet's in the back.
[20:14.44]Is your name Dante, son of Sparda?
[20:19.64]Where did you hear that?
[20:22.10]From your brother.
[20:28.49]He's got a small head.
[20:29.51]Yeah, whatever.
[20:33.70]Who cares?
[20:34.18]Oh, I don't think you want to mess with me, man.
[20:48.11]I can XXXXXX YYYY BB XXXXX YYYY BB better than anybody you know.
[21:15.90]What is going on right now?
[21:28.54]He's got stuff sticking out of him.
[21:35.02]Okay.
[21:37.61]Oh, man.
[21:43.75]It is really quiet.
[21:44.67]I'll turn it up.
[21:45.13]I'm sorry.
[21:52.67]Oh, now it's not quiet.
[22:08.53]What was that?
[22:31.68]Why is he doing like... Alright, tutorial time.
[22:51.81]This is... Okay, select.
[22:54.47]From four basic styles, use your select style action to show the enemies just how crazy this party can get.
[23:00.97]So you pick from Gunslinger, Royal Guard, Trickster, or Swordmaster.
[23:07.19]And B is your style attack.
[23:08.61]Okay.
[23:14.33]Defeat enough enemies and eventually your style will level up.
[23:16.59]Bring you new and wonderful style actions.
[23:20.12]So you have to play with a style to be able to level up that style.
[23:25.54]Or do I have to pick one of these?
[23:27.28]I've seen a lot of people in the chat here.
[23:31.33]Okay, hold on.
[23:33.65]You will master a new style action every time your style advances.
[23:36.07]Okay.
[23:38.41]Gain experience points by defeating enemies.
[23:43.43]Change styles mid-game via the mission start screen or by... Okay, so you got to stick with something for a little while.
[23:49.84]You will begin the game with the trickster style pre-selected.
[23:54.39]Okay.
[23:54.69]Mission one, crazy party.
[24:00.41]Customize.
[24:03.33]Whoa.
[24:05.69]I did not know there was all this.
[24:10.25]So these are my weapons.
[24:11.94]I think I only have these.
[24:13.32]That's it.
[24:13.62]Alright.
[24:15.88]Style.
[24:17.46]Let me read these.
[24:17.96]Information.
[24:21.29]uh allows player to avoid enemy attacks using special okay so this is probably a dodge roll which is I think I'm gonna I'm probably gonna pick that one master different melee weapons and maximize each weapon's power I like that too I'm not gonna look at chat right now because I know you're telling me the meta you're probably saying hey dude royal guard is literally don't do anything else but I want to ruin my playthrough before I look over here so let's do it
[24:47.13]Gunslinger.
[24:48.81]Player can master different guns.
[24:50.40]I like that.
[24:51.12]I like that.
[24:53.94]Royal Guard.
[24:54.82]Minimizing the damage of an enemy attack.
[24:56.32]Alright, so this is defense.
[24:58.62]Defense.
[25:00.60]Ranged DPS.
[25:02.08]Melee DPS.
[25:04.08]And sort of like rogue kind of survivability.
[25:09.19]So do I want to be like quick?
[25:11.83]Quick, quick, quick?
[25:13.49]Fight, fight?
[25:15.01]Shoot, shoot?
[25:16.01]Or defend?
[25:16.59]Defend.
[25:22.16]I feel like I want to pick this one.
[25:27.91]Because when I think of Devil May Cry, and this might be a different, I'm thinking of a different game maybe.
[25:34.52]When I think of Devil May Cry, I've never played it, but I think of two pistols.
[25:40.04]Forward, forward, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[25:41.28]Then holding them behind my head.
[25:43.02]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[25:44.20]Then one forward and one behind my head.
[25:46.05]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[25:47.41]Spinning around.
[25:48.47]Both those guns are behind my head.
[25:49.77]I'm not looking.
[25:50.33]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[25:52.15]That's kind of, that's what I'm thinking of.
[25:54.41]That's Bayonetta.
[25:56.65]Why am I playing this?
[26:01.89]Let's try it.
[26:09.21]Go for it.
[26:11.56]Alright.
[26:13.22]Master the true power of Dante.
[26:16.64]So that's lock on, melee, style action, examine, shoot.
[26:22.42]Alright.
[26:24.40]These two.
[26:25.68]This is a special move and then jump.
[26:28.75]Character move.
[26:29.83]Taunt.
[26:30.11]There's a taunt.
[26:31.93]Hold right bumper then press left stick to change lock on targets.
[26:34.73]Alright.
[26:35.33]Good to know.
[26:42.03]Yeah.
[26:42.33]That.
[26:42.89]This is what I'm thinking of.
[26:43.55]Okay.
[26:45.01]Red orb.
[26:45.75]A magic red stone of crystallized demon blood.
[26:48.65]Offer to the gods to earn new power.
[26:51.71]And is this.
[26:52.39]Can I mash?
[26:54.97]No.
[26:55.21]Not good enough.
[26:59.18]Should I mash as fast as I can?
[27:03.16]Max differ depending on the time.
[27:04.74]Oh, here we go.
[27:05.70]This is explaining to me no.
[27:08.87]So Y, Y, Y. Y, Y, Y. Repeatedly press X to rapidly fire.
[27:15.97]Press X while jumping.
[27:18.27]Okay.
[27:20.14]So it's like Y, Y, Y. Y, Y, Y. Y, Y, Y. Y, Y, Y.
[27:32.97]I got an A. Alright, I get it.
[27:46.46]I just got an S. Oh, I need to lock on.
[27:51.88]Oh, it's hold lock on.
[27:52.94]Okay.
[27:56.77]Okay.
[28:00.52]I feel like I'm going to like this game.
[28:02.23]I feel like I'm going to like it.
[28:04.91]Current enemy you are locked on to will be displayed with a cursor.
[28:09.05]Change the target with the left stick.
[28:12.73]Taunting increases the meter.
[28:14.14]That's what I figured.
[28:20.92]Okay, so that's to get to the closest enemy.
[28:48.08]Okay, let's see how long I can do that.
[28:59.31]So what's wrong with Devil May Cry 2?
[29:00.49]Why is everybody hating it?
[29:15.37]Oh, wait.
[29:16.43]That's like a style move?
[29:17.54]Ooh.
[29:17.86]Alright, I'm trying to figure out the lock-on.
[29:31.10]So if I lock on to somebody, how do I... Oh, I have to click the stick in.
[29:35.33]Okay, I get it.
[29:35.83]And it just goes to the nearest.
[29:37.65]I get it.
[29:44.90]Okay.
[29:45.22]Magic green stone to crystallize demon essence.
[29:47.36]It returns lost life.
[29:51.87]I'll take a C. That's fine.
[30:00.43]I didn't turn it up.
[30:01.05]Sorry.
[30:07.96]It's terrible gameplay and story.
[30:10.62]The characters are all fucked.
[30:22.42]Oh, you ruined it.
[30:24.76]I can already tell.
[30:40.65]Looks like this is going to be one hell of a party.
[30:48.65]Yeah.
[30:49.25]Alright.
[30:56.75]Alright.
[30:57.13]I didn't even know about the style points.
[31:01.49]That's a B?
[31:07.55]B-A-B, B-A-B, B-A-B-I-B-O-B-I.
[31:12.49]Isn't that the Three Stooges?
[31:18.12]Okay.
[31:29.08]I did not turn it up yet.
[31:31.74]I will right now, I promise.
[31:43.04]Did the graphics get better after leaving that house?
[31:45.58]Dammit.
[31:48.41]You guys totally wrecked my shop.
[31:50.19]And I haven't even named it yet.
[31:54.57]You're gonna pay for that.
[32:04.47]I almost wish he took an extra like five seconds to put that on or ten seconds.
[32:30.56]Turn it up.
[32:31.14]I'm sorry.
[32:33.43]I got it.
[32:36.30]Okay.
[32:38.38]Blast the enemy into the air.
[32:39.80]Hold right bumper and press Y while holding the left stick back.
[32:46.95]So there's certain- there's different moves.
[32:48.37]It's not just Y Y Y Y Y B B B B B B. You have to do certain combos.
[32:52.69]It's like playing Street Fighter.
[32:54.01]Okay.
[33:03.99]Is that better?
[33:06.26]That's better, right?
[33:06.94]Are we happy with this?
[33:07.78]So hold Y. How come it doesn't work?
[33:25.89]I'm holding Y. Hold Y. Oh, and you have to hit back.
[33:34.38]Oh shit, right.
[33:38.82]Ah, there it is.
[33:46.73]Ooh, alright.
[34:00.42]Ooh, that was cool.
[34:25.21]Oops.
[34:30.11]I don't know why I just thought this was funny.
[34:33.49]I don't know why my brain just thought that I was going to uninstall the game.
[34:36.55]Imagine that uninstall the game was in the menu and it was one down from resume game.
[34:53.00]Oh, thank God.
[34:53.74]Alright, there is a dodge roll.
[34:56.06]I was going to say I'm missing it.
[35:02.31]What the fuck are you saying, bro?
[35:03.61]I don't know.
[35:04.07]I think that would be humorous.
[35:11.10]Alright, so there is a dodge roll.
[35:12.74]Thank goodness.
[35:13.48]I was going to say there wasn't one.
[35:15.18]I was going to be very, very unhappy about it.
[35:41.33]Get this thing out of here!
[35:45.01]Am I doing bad?
[36:12.06]Yeah, a little.
[36:13.62]Oh, boss fight versus death.
[36:27.16]Ow.
[36:43.97]What is that?
[36:47.53]Ooh.
[36:52.98]Oh, shit.
[37:00.36]Alright, let's go.
[37:05.81]I gotta get used to the game.
[37:06.99]I gotta get used to the controls.
[37:17.13]I just downloaded it 15 minutes ago.
[37:42.43]Better?
[37:42.73]This is going better.
[37:53.50]I'll tell you one thing that's kind of crossing me up is having to hold right bumper to dodge.
[37:58.70]I'm not used to that.
[37:59.94]In my brain, pressing B or A dodges always.
[38:02.88]That's going to take at least an hour or five to get used to.
[38:26.96]Alright, let's go.
[38:29.46]Okay, I'm gonna fight death again.
[38:32.30]He's still alive.
[38:34.21]Oh, this idiot.
[38:41.00]Is it healing?
[38:58.73]Fuck, I'm not gonna be able to beat this guy.
[39:00.41]Oh, do I get any Gunslinger moves?
[39:24.12]I have no health.
[39:32.38]Yeah, click left to change lock on.
[39:34.16]Alright guys, I'm a FromSoftware Andy.
[39:36.91]You know, like, every video game has to be played like FromSoftware games or I can't play them.
[39:43.13]Like, B is not dodge.
[39:44.69]I lose.
[39:45.09]I mean, there's no S-Displask I can do with X. I can't play it.
[39:51.09]It's over.
[39:58.55]This game's not for old people.
[40:00.07]I got it right here.
[40:11.42]Somebody said open your inventory?
[40:12.58]How do I do that?
[40:13.12]How do I open my inventory?
[40:21.00]How do I open my inventory?
[40:24.19]It's E?
[40:24.63]No, I'm on a controller.
[40:29.23]Oh my God, I'm dead.
[40:30.33]This game's hard.
[40:35.11]I think this is a hard game.
[40:36.84]Oh, it's down in the D pad.
[40:38.00]Alright.
[40:45.20]OK, this is a hard game.
[40:54.96]Is everybody laughing because I picked Gunslinger?
[40:57.30]Is that what I did wrong?
[41:06.86]Well, alright, I'll try it one more time with Gunslinger.
[41:21.99]Starting out with Gunslinger is hard.
[41:23.37]Alright, well I'll try it one more time.
[41:33.05]Level one Gunslinger is bad, okay.
[41:35.79]Alright, I'll change it if I can't do it this time.
[41:43.97]You should be jumping way more.
[42:13.16]Neutral jump has more iframes than your dodge roll.
[42:16.64]And where are the iframes?
[42:17.56]Are they at the very beginning, or the end, or the middle?
[42:19.44]Where are they at?
[42:27.55]Fuck.
[42:39.33]Alright, I got half health.
[42:55.34]Is there a sprint?
[42:56.58]How do I run?
[42:57.10]How do I move faster?
[43:07.77]Use trickster, please.
[43:08.81]Alright, this is my last try with this and then I'll move quickly.
[43:17.66]Alright, I got it.
[43:24.65]God damn it.
[43:25.57]That was quick.
[43:32.09]Oh my God, he's going to kill me again.
[43:33.79]I'm in the tutorial.
[43:34.99]Is this game really?
[43:35.69]Okay, wait.
[43:36.49]Can I ask a question?
[43:37.93]Is this game really, really fucking hard?
[43:40.79]Is this supposed to be this hard?
[43:51.42]He's going to go.
[43:52.04]Dude.
[43:58.80]People got rocked by this boss back in the day.
[44:01.40]I mean, this guy's... This guy's no joke.
[44:03.16]This game is... No, don't put that on screen.
[44:06.13]Don't put that on stream and ruin my life.
[44:08.73]It's already there.
[44:09.31]Okay.
[44:13.13]Don't put that on... Okay.
[44:18.42]Damn, this is hard.
[44:19.52]Okay.
[44:19.84]Alright, let me...
[44:25.96]How do I make it so I can... What's my style?
[44:35.65]I'm not doing anything flashy.
[44:36.87]I'm just going to try to stay alive.
[44:37.97]I don't care if I get a D. I want to just beat it.
[44:47.96]Shit.
[44:53.08]I had to...
[44:56.22]I almost want to remap the dodge to just be like A. That's the thing that's causing me the most problems right now.
[45:14.80]What did I just do?
[45:25.49]Is there a way to move the camera quickly so I can actually see who I'm fighting?
[45:29.09]This has got to be like a camera reposition, right?
[45:39.90]Alright, that didn't go as bad.
[45:42.16]I'm learning.
[45:42.54]Alright, I'm back at full health.
[46:00.48]Oh, that's how you do that.
[46:01.48]Alright, that's fun.
[46:03.28]I got it.
[46:05.82]Immediately succeed.
[46:31.87]Alright.
[46:32.53]Bosses.
[46:33.17]Here's the boss.
[46:33.75]Let's go.
[46:38.55]Enemies off camera won't.
[46:39.93]Oh, this guy's still alive.
[46:40.69]Alright, let's go.
[46:45.05]This is the one.
[46:45.55]This is the one right here.
[46:46.23]Trickster literally has a dodge on B, please.
[46:50.81]Alright.
[46:55.50]I got it.
[46:55.96]I got to beat this stuff.
[47:01.58]He dives and then jump!
[47:02.93]Oh my god!
[47:21.32]I'm like kind of parrying somehow.
[47:26.58]Ugh!
[47:49.29]Shit.
[47:50.39]I'm missing something here.
[48:07.16]I definitely tell you, if I got this game, I would have cried and returned it.
[48:23.82]I would have cried.
[48:24.38]I would have cried and been like, I don't get it.
[48:27.20]Wait, is this game M?
[48:29.26]What is this rated?
[48:33.81]What is this game rated?
[48:34.65]Is this M?
[48:38.31]I probably still would have cried and returned it.
[48:39.59]Yeah.
[48:54.59]Try hit, hit, hit.
[48:56.45]Hold on.
[49:08.19]Wait, I'm getting some tips here.
[49:10.81]You can ride enemies?
[49:16.04]My worst fears of how a DMC stream would go are coming true.
[49:19.04]They'll switch to Mario in no time.
[49:22.99]This is much harder than I thought it was going to be.
[49:27.48]Well, OK, hard is not necessarily the answer to the question.
[49:31.16]It's needing to have the controls mastered in the first five minutes.
[49:36.32]Come on, Gwen.
[49:37.42]What's going on here?
[50:03.87]This is probably the hardest Devil May Cry game.
[50:07.07]I'm all for it.
[50:07.85]I know.
[50:08.11]I'm all for it.
[50:08.71]I just got to learn how to play the game well.
[50:12.33]I beat Millenia.
[50:12.99]That doesn't matter.
[50:14.41]I win every argument.
[50:18.80]But you used Tish.
[50:19.66]You used Tish.
[50:20.28]It doesn't matter.
[50:21.52]I don't care.
[50:22.32]Okay.
[50:45.56]Alright, let's go.
[50:47.76]I'm gonna be the tutorial boss, I promise.
[50:50.22]I'll be the tutorial, I will.
[50:54.58]The original version is considered the hardest.
[50:56.33]I mean, I like a challenge.
[50:59.03]Let's go.
[51:01.63]Put it on easy mode.
[51:02.55]No!
[51:03.13]I got it right here.
[51:03.67]Watch this.
[51:04.95]I got it.
[51:10.30]Where are the iframes?
[51:16.95]Where are the iframes?
[51:24.08]Where are the iframes?
[51:25.02]How do I fucking dodge?
[51:32.64]Where are the iframes?
[51:42.24]God damn it.
[51:44.12]This is so fucking hard.
[51:56.74]Okay, we're gonna... I'm gonna... Can I... Can I do it from the menu?
[52:00.48]How do I do this?
[52:02.66]How do I pick the one that's not horrible?
[52:06.46]Which one is it?
[52:09.44]Gunslinger.
[52:10.56]I picked Gunslinger and I was getting fucking destroyed.
[52:15.39]Can I do it from here?
[52:15.95]Do I have to do a new game?
[52:24.61]You can't rely on iframes.
[52:30.43]I can from here?
[52:30.95]Oh, here we go.
[52:43.04]Okay.
[52:43.88]So normal to... Wait, what's going on?
[52:48.40]Demo digest?
[52:50.18]I'm confused.
[52:50.85]What is this menu?
[52:59.47]Alright, um, so this didn't work out that well.
[53:05.52]Trickster, I'll try trickster.
[53:14.84]Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:16.44]Vital start S. Is this a heel?
[53:23.81]I should buy this, right?
[53:25.07]Don't buy these OK.
[53:29.49]Alright, I'm ready.
[53:30.53]Let's go.
[53:31.11]Trickster.
[53:31.65]So what can Trickster do?
[53:36.63]I learned that.
[53:41.33]Oh my god, way better.
[53:43.41]The movement is so much more fluid.
[53:47.49]And there's no longer an input delay on every single button.
[53:51.25]I was pressing Y and it would be Y, and then the move would happen about two to three seconds later.
[53:56.40]Holy shit.
[53:57.40]This is way better.
[53:59.48]Yeah, I would hit Y to swing and three seconds would go by.
[54:02.29]What an input delay that was.
[54:03.36]That is hard mode.
[54:04.90]Thanks for letting me know.
[54:44.94]I love that move.
[54:48.31]Very cool.
[54:51.23]Oh, there is a dodge roll.
[54:52.37]Yeah, it's so much better.
[54:54.73]This is way better.
[54:55.59]This is way more how I want to actually play this video game.
[54:58.13]We're good.
[55:05.82]There it is.
[55:08.14]So this is a side roll and then a jump back.
[55:10.78]I know that.
[55:11.90]And now I have this.
[55:21.97]Alright, how much copium is it gonna take for me to get killed in the first 10 seconds of the tutorial boss?
[55:27.59]I wonder.
[55:55.66]Alright, I just got this.
[56:03.95]That's a heal.
[56:04.37]Alright, come on, let's go.
[56:05.67]No more fucking around.
[56:06.27]Alright, that's so much better.
[56:25.41]What was the iframes?
[57:03.76]Where's my menu?
[57:04.18]How do I take that heal?
[57:11.51]Where's my heal?
[57:15.81]Up on the d-pad?
[57:55.85]Okay, I'm good.
[57:56.49]I'm good.
[57:57.31]I get it now.
[57:58.27]The dodge roll changes the whole game.
[57:59.77]Why is everybody calling me DMC2 Andy?
[58:15.72]What's that?
[58:24.96]DMC2 is all about your guns.
[58:26.87]Should have started with that one.
[58:29.27]DMC2 sucks, dude.
[58:40.70]Alright, that was cool.
[58:41.68]I get it now.
[58:42.08]Where does the time go?
[59:14.48]Dress like Dante for Halloween.
[59:20.79]You can always tell, you know, who's been going to the gym lately by their Halloween costume.
[59:33.05]Dante from Devil May Cry is like, I've been going to the gym lately.
[59:43.33]I can fill out this shirt.
[59:53.10]It's alright.
[59:54.44]Hey.
[59:57.92]I think that's fine.
[60:00.48]I'm super bad with time management.
[60:03.58]I'm really good with my orbs.
[60:06.13]I'm not that stylish, but not super bad.
[60:08.31]I mean, the clothes I wear are fine.
[60:10.35]I don't do very much damage, but I will eat all of your food.
[60:13.63]I'll use all the stuff in your house.
[60:18.93]I mean, that's like, I think that's pretty accurate to me.
[60:21.83]I don't know what orbs is.
[60:22.89]Is that my brain?
[60:23.81]That's like how good, how strong my brain power is.
[60:31.04]That's the big orb in the middle of my skull.
[60:40.29]Orbs is collectibles.
[60:44.18]Oh, okay.
[60:51.70]Orbs is money?
[60:53.56]Doesn't it excite you?
[60:56.11]The Timon Negru has revived.
[60:59.33]The Great One, who once ruled this Earth as the medium between the human world.
[61:08.97]Isn't it a magnificent view?
[61:12.09]The greatest minds of their time, those who revered evil, constructed this glorious edifice.
[61:20.15]Now, after two millenniums of confinement, it can at last fulfill the purpose for which it was intended.
[61:27.98]That's none of my concern.
[61:32.28]Did he have it?
[61:34.42]Of course.
[61:36.74]He's taking good care of it.
[61:41.08]I don't know who this is.
[61:47.12]Oh, I got an unbelievable video idea.
[61:51.11]And I don't want to say it because I don't want anyone to steal it.
[61:57.59]I'm telling you, you guys are going to like this a lot.
[62:26.71]I might just put it on the main channel.
[62:28.51]Because, I don't know.
[62:29.43]I feel like it's going to annoy a lot of people.
[62:31.70]Because this would be the first video I've uploaded.
[62:34.53]But I feel like it would be funny.
[63:00.36]Cool.
[63:01.06]Alright.
[63:02.76]So Trickster's going fine.
[63:04.40]There's no way I can take it off Trickster.
[63:10.10]Because it's just not going to happen.
[63:19.71]Royal Guard gets a block.
[63:23.57]That sounds awesome.
[63:25.13]I might check it out.
[63:27.25]I'm all about defense and not taking damage when I play games like this.
[63:32.44]I'm two times as high as normal by pushing off of certain surfaces so you can wall jump.
[63:39.62]That's kind of cool.
[63:44.29]And you can jump off.
[63:54.31]Oh my goodness.
[64:04.60]Bro!
[64:07.10]He's dead.
[64:18.31]Okay, he's dead.
[64:23.97]I got it.
[64:25.07]I got it.
[64:25.51]It's fine.
[64:35.96]I'm sorry.
[64:36.54]I'm getting too caught up in trying to do like combos.
[64:41.12]And not surviving.
[65:04.97]Just survive.
[65:05.67]Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do.
[65:12.21]Do attack, wait, attack, attack.
[65:16.70]Like that, right?
[65:21.04]Boom, boom, boom.
[65:23.98]Boom, boom, boom.
[65:25.40]Got it.
[65:35.58]I didn't learn that.
[65:36.30]They didn't teach me that.
[65:37.00]That's cool.
[65:40.77]That was a cool move.
[65:42.99]Okay.
[65:48.60]Any secrets or anything I should know about?
[66:02.29]New gun.
[66:05.41]There are two types of sealed doors, red and blue.
[66:09.91]Release the doors sealed by solving a puzzle located in that room or defeat all the enemies.
[66:14.19]So red and blue.
[66:14.95]Blue is puzzle, red is... Okay.
[66:19.64]Yep, things are breakable.
[66:38.65]What is this?
[67:02.35]How come everybody's saying SCORN?
[67:03.61]Um, I've been trying to figure that out for like the last year.
[67:12.22]Shotgun.
[67:14.56]Cool.
[67:15.24]I definitely want that.
[67:15.90]We're gonna put the two pistols.
[67:17.74]Switch guns with left trigger in real time.
[67:22.31]I'm gonna like this way more.
[67:32.82]You're a fucking liar.
[67:38.84]Don't accuse me of that.
[67:41.76]Lying to somebody.
[67:43.52]I've never done that before in my life.
[67:53.20]Oh, shit.
[67:55.78]Oh, I gotta bring something up.
[67:57.06]This is really funny.
[67:58.22]I don't know why I thought about this.
[67:59.98]Holly and I were talking about this.
[68:02.02]And we were talking about what the ultimate Reddit test is.
[68:05.85]Like the ultimate Redditor test.
[68:09.27]Are you guys ready to take it?
[68:13.64]The ultimate Redditor test.
[68:15.90]Like if you use Reddit.
[68:18.70]Are you ready?
[68:20.41]Have you seen the Christopher Lee Lord of the Rings backstab video?
[68:33.66]Yes, if the answer is yes.
[68:36.00]You know, the one where he's like, oh, what happened to the air?
[68:41.77]If you've seen that video.
[68:46.18]I've seen that video probably 10 different times on Reddit.
[68:51.61]Across like a decade.
[68:55.37]I had to, we were sitting there thinking about it.
[68:56.59]I was like, you know what?
[68:57.43]I've seen that video every like year or two.
[68:59.83]That video makes the rounds.
[69:04.75]It's been like a decade.
[69:14.34]He admitted it.
[69:15.04]He's a Redditor.
[69:19.88]What about it?
[69:20.34]Bro, what are you doing?
[69:29.24]I'm talking and walking back and forth in the same room.
[69:47.26]Okay.
[69:47.98]Let me move this.
[69:52.72]Alright.
[69:53.20]Stylish rank.
[69:54.34]I know what that means.
[69:55.34]It means be better at the game.
[70:05.02]So don't get... Hey!
[70:06.55]Well, thanks for letting me know.
[70:07.91]Alright.
[70:19.95]Tap, tap, tap.
[70:35.10]How come I'm not doing the thing with the swords in front of me anymore?
[70:37.85]1, 1, 2.
[70:38.23]Huh.
[70:38.49]What the heck?
[70:58.74]Dude, just fucking lock in and mash already.
[71:04.88]Good advice, actually.
[71:06.00]Just hit me in the door?
[71:22.39]I don't know how I did that before, honestly.
[71:42.62]Alright, when no one's looking, why can I do it?
[71:47.06]What the fuck?
[72:00.13]Is there a move list somewhere?
[72:10.16]How do I get to it?
[72:24.16]Library?
[72:33.71]Devil Arms.
[72:34.41]Okay, Rebellion Combo 1.
[72:39.31]I know that.
[72:40.21]Rebellion Combo 2.
[72:41.87]I know that.
[72:43.25]Helm Breaker.
[72:44.89]I know this one.
[72:45.79]Yeah, it hasn't taught me these.
[72:47.51]Okay.
[72:51.20]Okay.
[72:53.18]And I've been doing that one.
[72:54.88]Here it is.
[72:56.86]Repeatedly press Y while executing a type 2 combo.
[73:04.02]So I have to mash Y. So like this.
[73:07.08]That didn't work.
[73:14.14]You have to do it during the second.
[73:16.98]Okay, I think I got it.
[73:17.72]Let me try it again.
[73:29.89]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[73:38.85]I'm starting to understand the game.
[73:51.07]You know I have to collect every... I'm an orb person, right?
[73:56.83]I always get A on orbs.
[73:59.60]That's my thing.
[74:00.68]Your thing could- that's fine.
[74:01.60]Your thing could be gameplay and can be getting S-style and shit like that.
[74:07.67]I get S on orbs.
[74:09.03]I collect stuff.
[74:12.93]How's this thing?
[74:37.17]Do I have to do something with this?
[74:54.44]Is this a DPS check?
[75:00.95]Oh.
[75:03.25]Okay.
[75:08.03]I got two of those fragments.
[75:16.46]What does this mean?
[75:23.19]Statue of the omniscient god of time and space.
[75:26.39]By offering a demon blood, one can attain the power of the ancient magic lands.
[75:32.40]Power up.
[75:33.62]Exchange orbs for items like vital stars, exchange orbs to learn new moves, or power up your guns.
[75:39.02]Oh, alright.
[75:49.39]Shit.
[75:56.33]What is this gonna do?
[75:57.01]High speed lunge attack.
[76:01.91]It skewers them through the center.
[76:03.09]So you have to be running while you do it.
[76:10.97]What's this one?
[76:12.51]Lightning quick sword swing that sends a powerful shockwave.
[76:15.82]I like that.
[76:16.30]$10,000.
[76:16.32]Okay, so this one is... I can upgrade it.
[76:31.91]So hold that and forward and then press Y. I feel like I should get some of these.
[76:41.60]I could buy a blue orb.
[76:47.42]Okay.
[76:50.02]What do four of these do?
[76:50.90]I'm going to get a couple of these.
[76:56.56]Is that dumb?
[77:01.21]I don't know.
[77:02.85]My new move.
[77:10.00]Seems pretty good.
[77:10.52]Can I combo it?
[77:19.20]Kind of.
[77:24.19]Ice Guardian's Chamber.
[77:25.51]I think this is probably going to be Abba.
[77:27.71]Abba.
[77:29.71]Abba's fight, I think.
[77:37.69]How many viewers did you have when you started?
[77:40.48]It was 70,000 people here.
[77:42.22]I lost like a lot, though.
[77:44.82]I took a long time in the tutorial, so it's alright.
[77:52.90]Alright, do you mean ever?
[77:56.48]Because that's not correct.
[78:00.52]You mean like when I first turned the screen on ever?
[78:04.23]I don't know.
[78:07.88]I came from a different position in the... Hold on.
[78:10.31]Easy, Fido.
[78:10.83]How about I take you out for a walk?
[78:43.78]Is there no silence?
[78:46.82]Worm.
[78:48.92]Insolent.
[78:52.52]What are you doing?
[78:58.88]What's that move?
[79:01.52]Okay.
[79:10.10]Ow.
[79:27.26]I think you have to break the ice off the heads.
[79:33.98]What just happened?
[79:34.67]I can't even hurt this thing.
[79:42.87]You got to break the ice off.
[79:44.49]That's very... Yeah, see?
[79:49.72]I can't get close, though.
[79:50.86]That's like death if I get close.
[79:52.20]I don't know why I'm even trying it.
[80:07.91]Oh shit.
[80:14.07]Stop using guns?
[80:15.76]When I get close, I get scared.
[80:25.61]The guns suck.
[80:26.37]Stop using them.
[80:39.41]Is my theory correct, bro?
[80:41.43]Is my theory correct?
[80:45.55]I don't even know what his moveset is.

[85:09.67]Okay, we're good.
[85:15.49]We're good.
[85:16.32]I almost just threw so bad.
[85:17.60]Okay.
[85:28.10]take my soul and go forth you have my blessing I love this voice what's that thing
[85:58.70]Nunchucks.
[86:00.42]Well, that's my new weapon, for sure.
[86:10.66]A three-sided nunchuck.
[86:20.61]I'm never using the sword ever again.
[86:50.54]Orbs, yep.
[86:51.66]That's me.
[86:52.50]I collect orbs.
[86:53.86]Where are they?
[86:54.18]I lost orbs.
[86:58.24]What?
[87:08.89]Would they despawn?
[87:10.07]I was testing my new weapon.
[87:11.55]They gotta figure that you're gonna do that when you get it.
[87:19.50]This was the part where I walked out of the theater.
[87:51.52]No, I would stay.
[88:09.66]This just keeps getting better and better.
[88:29.19]Hey!
[88:34.99]Look at that!
[88:36.63]C for orbs?
[88:37.51]How?
[88:38.34]That's not even... How many did I lose out on?
[88:41.76]Did I actually lose out on a lot?
[88:47.02]It was a lot.
[88:48.16]It was like 2k.
[88:49.22]Are you kidding me?
[88:50.40]Okay.
[88:54.57]I'm supposed to be the orb guy and I couldn't even do my job that I'm supposed to be doing.
[89:03.94]Oh, that's bad.
[89:04.88]Oh, well.
[89:20.91]It's okay.
[89:33.25]How come all my titles have that three face?
[89:35.96]Maude keeps doing that.
[89:37.18]Wanna know who?
[89:39.20]Alright.
[89:39.50]For a second I thought this guy's clothes were on backwards.
[90:03.28]I thought he was wearing a jacket the other way.
[90:04.88]I was like, no, that's not how... I don't know why my brain just thought that for a second.
[90:08.34]I was like, wait, does he have his shirt?
[90:11.10]Oh, no.
[90:11.58]It's like a suit.
[90:13.70]Like a all the way up suit.
[90:29.75]Alright.
[90:29.99]Do I want to change anything?
[90:33.48]Am I still level one trickster?
[90:35.06]I feel like that's I'm going to be in a mobile game.
[90:40.26]I don't want to be a level one trickster.
[91:01.64]I'm curious.
[91:06.28]Revolver level two.
[91:09.50]Windmill.
[91:10.18]I can do a windmill?
[91:15.07]Spin the nunchucks around in a propeller-like motion to rapidly slice into the enemy.
[91:18.57]I like that.
[91:20.41]Hmm.
[91:33.08]Not enough orbs.
[91:35.58]Yeah.
[91:37.82]Don't remind me.
[91:38.54]I'm alright for now.
[91:42.59]I'll try this new stance, though.
[91:48.29]This is the PC version.
[91:49.27]This is part of the HD collection.
[92:03.90]This level is going to take you two hours.
[92:08.14]Is he saying that because they just introduced the map system?
[92:15.16]Okay.
[92:18.28]The map shows off your surrounding area from an overhead perspective.
[92:23.22]Interesting.
[92:23.76]Okay.
[92:25.86]It shows a graphical image from the room you currently occupy.
[92:28.79]Yeah.
[92:30.39]Press the D-pad to view the various floors you have visited.
[92:34.35]Come on, wimp.
[92:41.01]OK.
[92:43.07]So.
[92:45.99]I get it.
[92:46.31]But this is where I am, and this is where I'm going.
[92:49.91]I get it.
[92:58.04]Antares Inferno.
[93:01.10]Ready to door.
[93:04.24]Wrong game.
[93:08.16]Wrong entire series.
[93:09.74]I don't know why I keep saying that.
[93:10.94]Is there a double jump?
[93:28.14]No.
[93:32.98]You gotta be really strict.
[93:34.92]You have to go like...
[93:41.83]Come on.
[93:46.47]That's a lot.
[93:47.07]Okay, this is a lot harder than it looks.
[93:55.17]There we go.
[93:58.31]That's actually a lot harder than it looks.
[93:59.73]I'm actually kind of surprised I just did that.
[94:01.13]This door.
[94:06.08]Come on, wimp.
[94:24.38]Dope.
[94:32.42]Oh, red door means.
[94:35.02]Enemies Dante.
[94:41.19]Press B. I like the nunchucks.
[94:53.03]Seems fun.
[94:59.93]During a certain circumstance, you can repeatedly press a button to execute a special high-speed combo attack.
[95:04.89]Yeah.
[95:07.13]Okay.
[95:16.24]So that has to be with the sword.
[95:24.16]Oh my goodness.
[95:40.43]Oh, dude.
[95:41.27]Oh, dude.
[95:41.83]He knows how to weapon switch now.
[95:44.46]You gotta come back to the stream.
[95:45.26]He knows what he's doing now.
[95:48.78]Bro, I told you I was going to eat dinner like fucking 40 minutes ago.
[95:51.88]Stop messaging me.
[95:55.77]Did you see my last message?
[95:57.57]Stop.
[96:33.51]You just messed up my combo.
[96:39.41]Where is this person?
[96:42.51]Alright, that's not fair.
[96:43.33]They're in a weird spot and I can't change the camera.
[96:52.06]Anybody else?
[96:59.62]Hit, hit, wall, hit, hit.
[97:01.78]I'll try it.
[97:08.12]That's too advanced for me.
[97:13.92]Do more static X's.
[97:20.32]Hey, it was my birthday yesterday.
[97:21.30]Can you Elmo for me?
[97:23.66]I'm sorry.
[97:24.04]I have a strict policy where I can only do an Elmo if it's somebody's birthday today or right now.
[97:31.41]Being with the will of the thunderstorm, I bestow the soul of steel.
[97:40.06]I have to do like a magic spell on this one.
[97:58.33]So I gotta go up that way.
[98:01.69]Not over here.
[98:10.97]Hmm.
[98:12.29]Wait.
[98:14.37]Does the map tell me where I'm currently standing or is that just the room I'm standing in?
[98:20.34]Oh, okay.
[98:21.26]So that little indicator does not tell me where I'm standing.
[98:24.50]That's just... I thought the little yellow diamond was where I was standing.
[98:32.28]So what do I get for doing this?
[98:33.88]Just money?
[98:34.74]And then I have to come back and do an electrical spell to that thing?
[98:47.23]Hmm.
[99:20.42]Okay, this weighs too much.
[99:21.48]Can I break these?
[99:22.09]Of course I can.
[99:29.09]Do you think the Lakers are going to win tonight?
[99:38.53]I will give you a prediction.
[99:39.35]I think the Lakers are going to take it.
[99:43.55]Ninety... Five...
[99:50.42]86 You're gonna lose money if you bet that number
[100:23.53]I don't even know the context, but yeah.
[100:28.33]Hey, buddy, I don't know if I would do that.
[100:30.34]I wouldn't take that bet.
[100:31.32]I don't understand.
[100:34.36]This streamer who hasn't watched a basketball game since he was 14 told me.
[100:42.38]That's pretty sad.
[101:05.26]Oh, you just ruined everything.
[101:16.16]That was that was really sloppy.
[101:21.23]I cleaned it up at the end.
[101:21.93]Is that like a parry or something?
[101:43.77]Let's go.
[101:46.58]It's a combo extender.
[101:47.62]Any orbs?
[101:59.81]Who are the Lakers even playing right now?
[102:03.83]I don't even know the answer to that question.
[102:16.07]Playing Denver.
[102:18.79]Look at mod for a score update right now.
[102:21.89]Oh, it's 118 to 104.
[102:24.97]Lakers are down right now.
[102:26.92]Don't, yeah, do not bet that.
[102:28.76]They can't take points away in basketball.
[102:33.02]Yeah, I'm coming in.
[102:33.68]I'm just, I want to put a bet down on the game that's going on right now.
[102:37.80]Sure, what can I do for you?
[102:40.34]Yeah, I could, Lakers are going to take it, I think, 95, 95, 86.
[102:45.53]Um, you want, you want to take that?
[102:48.91]That's what you're betting right now.
[102:51.41]Yeah, it's the lake is going to take it.
[102:56.21]Sir, I, I'll take the money.
[102:59.25]I can make that jump.
[103:12.69]What are the odds on that again?
[103:14.41]Like, uh, 15 to 1, 20 to 1?
[103:16.77]I'm not sure the odds on that right now are zero.
[103:22.96]Uh, that's alright.
[103:23.70]That's alright.
[103:24.02]I'll fucking still do it.
[103:26.32]You sell cigarettes here?
[103:42.24]I'm going to fall off this.
[103:42.98]Look at my health.
[103:50.46]What?
[104:03.18]That was annoying.
[104:22.13]Alright, we got him.
[104:25.21]Okay, how am I supposed to deal with that?
[105:00.42]This is horrible.
[105:01.68]It's horrible.
[105:11.13]No, I want to target... I want to customize the controls.
[105:16.83]I don't like the pressing in left stick to change.
[105:19.64]It's kind of annoying to do.
[105:31.50]Having to push left stick in to change target.
[105:34.22]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't like it.
[105:54.46]If you kill me, I'll be very upset.
[105:56.74]Okay, we're good.
[106:10.04]Off-screen enemies won't initiate attacks.
[106:12.02]They're balanced.
[106:14.98]That's actually really good to know, though.
[106:17.56]Where am I going?
[106:25.11]I can go up through this door or right back.
[106:27.07]I'm going to go up, right?
[106:29.50]Why not?
[106:41.60]Oh, man.
[106:43.40]We hit a boss again?
[106:44.36]I like that, though.
[106:46.60]I really like that.
[106:49.60]Although I really don't like having no health.
[106:56.42]How far back is the checkpoint if I lose here?
[106:58.26]I'm kind of concerned.
[107:02.83]Is it just that door?
[107:08.49]Alright, so don't waste the health.
[107:50.93]Okay, what are you?
[107:55.58]Can I fall down?
[107:56.40]Oh, I can.
[107:57.38]I thought it was death.
[108:04.18]Do I want to turn him red?
[108:05.10]He just kind of looks like ribs.
[108:07.70]Yeah, alright.
[108:08.96]You turn him red, then he hides away, and then goes back out.
[108:26.50]Okay, so unironically, I have to jump on top.
[108:29.36]That was good.
[108:48.30]Unironically.
[109:04.68]Shit, I missed.
[109:05.44]Come on!
[109:11.07]It's alright, I'll get it.
[109:12.81]Try the bee attacks.
[109:16.01]Oh shit.
[109:35.79]I'm tasting venom.
[109:59.09]Somebody complaining about the refs of the Lakers game in here.
[110:11.68]Alright, this isn't that bad.
[110:12.48]I think I get it.
[110:14.00]Can we do a poll?
[110:19.55]Who do you guys want to win?
[110:20.81]Lakers or Denver?
[110:28.67]It's definitely going to be the Lakers, right?
[110:30.14]It's going to be the Lakers.
[110:37.12]Okay, what is going on right now?
[110:42.27]Alright, things were going really well until five seconds ago.
[110:46.61]Alright, somebody said they hate this boss, now I understand why.
[111:09.89]Where are you?
[111:14.82]What does this jump remind me of?
[111:20.41]It's like, it's super sticky.
[111:29.67]It's like a straight up, straight down.
[111:37.24]I feel like I weigh 7 million pounds.
[111:56.46]That wasn't bad.
[111:58.54]Get over here.
[112:14.39]I'm gonna heal.
[112:34.29]I got it.
[112:34.69]Oh, I didn't even heal.
[112:35.17]I'm good.
[112:35.41]I got it.
[112:35.95]I think most of chat voted for the nuggets because they're hungry.
[112:50.94]Do not let these despawn.
[112:58.97]Oh, a good helping a chicken nuggets.
[113:01.85]That sounds pretty good.
[113:06.56]Alright, where am I going?
[113:11.80]That was cool.
[113:15.46]So there's one direction I didn't go, which is this way?
[113:18.30]Am I going the right way?
[113:21.55]I wish I could tell if I was facing north or south.
[113:25.23]Try B button on nunchucks.
[113:31.65]Seems kind of good.
[113:41.72]astronomical board powered by time there's only like 15 minutes left in the game right

[114:44.25]That could be a problem.
[114:46.95]Just hear me out.

[115:28.36]Actually, I prefer a sword to be my partner.
[115:31.89]May I have this dance, m'lady?
[115:41.72]You guys understand what I have to go through just to brush my teeth in the morning?
[116:08.91]Like, that's just how it is.
[116:23.78]DBCDS.
[116:30.98]Crushes his teeth in the shower sometimes.
[116:34.30]You can save a lot of time.
[116:47.71]CBD Gamer?
[116:50.92]Is that right?
[116:59.25]Okay, I need to see them all, so I'm gonna pick Royal Guard.
[117:14.94]You save two minutes by brushing your teeth in the shower.
[117:17.14]Can help.
[117:18.20]One of you done.
[117:44.49]You could see the conclusion of this battle if you pre-ordered Devil May Cry 3.
[117:50.97]With collectible art booklet included.
[118:16.09]How do you deal with birds?
[118:24.63]Like that!
[118:26.69]Just like that!
[118:44.80]What the hell am I doing?
[118:47.68]Oh, I have a different move, right.
[118:51.83]Okay.
[118:52.89]My brain has so much trouble with multiple button context menus.
[118:59.75]Like holding right bumper and pressing X and then hitting like left trigger and then pressing Y.
[119:12.58]and then pressing in left stick and then switching.
[119:15.22]It's a lot of combinations.
[119:21.10]It's a lot of combinations that are across the whole map.
[119:37.99]I dodged at the wrong, the exact wrong time.
[119:58.08]Get over here!
[120:13.61]Oh, crazy good!
[120:56.99]Get that up to A. Where's that thing?
[121:07.21]Old Y with the sword launch.
[121:14.74]Came out in 2005.
[121:16.62]I forget just how old this game really is.
[121:22.28]Welcome to hell.
[121:26.19]I kind of forget.
[121:26.63]Wait, I have to fight him?
[121:28.27]I thought he was my friend.
[121:30.13]Oh my god.
[121:57.56]Alright, watch out for the orbs.
[122:23.04]Shit!
[122:33.77]That was good I can't even move
[123:07.21]Watch out!
[123:23.60]Shit.
[123:34.66]my name is why is it
[124:16.67]Whoa!
[124:20.65]How do I heal?
[124:21.67]What's the heal?
[124:22.09]What's the heal?
[124:22.43]What's the heal?
[124:22.81]What's the heal?
[124:23.19]Alright, it's up on the D-pad.
[124:44.79]Got him.
[124:49.33]That was a tech talk.
[124:54.41]Okay.
[125:16.27]Cool.
[125:18.93]So now what?
[125:22.04]I'm starting to understand why people like this game so much.
[125:26.10]Let me give you my first impression after an hour or two.
[125:31.40]This game is... It's bosses.
[125:34.09]You just fight a shitload of bosses.
[125:36.47]Is that correct?
[125:40.77]It's just run down a hallway and fight a few things, but then fight the boss.
[125:50.39]I like games like that.
[125:52.28]I enjoy them.
[125:57.22]I like fighting against bosses.
[126:03.06]I can't go this way.
[126:06.34]Can't jump down.
[126:11.26]You fight a few things and make it look cool.
[126:14.50]Where am I going?
[126:20.36]Straight and then straight?
[126:22.96]Does that make sense?
[126:35.53]Is your taunt and your pause the same for some reason?
[126:39.81]Uh, I can answer that.
[126:41.69]So I'm pressing select because in my mind, see in my brain, in my brain.
[126:46.18]So my brain does this thing in my mind.
[126:47.44]Forget about like the sentence that I say before every other sentence.
[126:53.18]Um, this is the map button.
[126:55.42]Like this is, I'm trying to press, I'm trying to open the map or like a sub menu.
[127:03.35]And then I realized it's start and then in the start menu.
[127:11.02]He does this thing with his mind.
[127:15.64]Get it again.
[127:21.75]How do I get across this?
[127:27.65]I can't get across that.
[127:28.47]There's orbs here I didn't get.
[127:49.28]Just go, it's fine.
[127:50.53]Are we bringing back the just go meme?
[127:53.33]That's an old one.
[127:54.07]I remember just go.
[128:03.21]That's an old one.
[128:03.77]Okay.
[128:23.03]It's all the way down.
[128:23.99]Okay.
[128:30.98]Is it fall damage?
[128:34.44]No.
[128:37.04]Alright.
[128:53.97]I think I want the windmill.
[128:57.37]Hold down right bumper plus back and press fly.
[129:02.66]I don't want to waste too much money.
[129:13.37]Uh, how many of these do I have?
[129:23.49]How come I only have two blue orbs?
[129:24.71]Didn't I have three?
[129:36.49]I thought I had three fragments.
[129:42.09]Oh, I bought a blue orb.
[129:44.26]What can I even do with it?
[129:54.18]Damn it.
[129:54.84]It's expensive.
[129:57.30]It's just more health bar.
[129:59.08]Oh.
[130:00.82]Very cool.
[130:03.56]I'm saving my money.
[130:05.04]I am gonna buy one more of these.
[130:09.20]I know.
[130:09.54]This is so... Look at how stupid this is now.
[130:13.19]It's just gonna keep going up.
[130:18.72]I know you just spit out your food.
[130:21.18]And you were eating a taco.
[130:23.04]And you just made a mess everywhere.
[130:24.84]I'm sorry.
[130:26.32]You just could not believe what I just did.
[130:32.36]And it like fell down and went into the couch that you're sitting on.
[130:37.28]Down into like the crevice next to you, which always sucks.
[130:41.60]Because it's like, okay, that's food.
[130:43.18]I have to go fucking find that.
[130:45.82]And it's gonna take me probably 20 minutes to get it all cleaned up.
[130:48.90]Because it went down into the fucking couch.
[130:54.49]Especially with something like lettuce.
[130:57.21]Oh man, it's gonna stick to something at the bottom.
[130:58.93]It's gonna be awful.
[131:00.09]It's gonna take you like an hour.
[131:16.27]Okay, I wanted these.
[131:16.99]Something else opened too.
[131:18.55]Where was it?
[131:20.75]I saw it.
[131:21.19]It was an item.
[131:23.91]Right there.
[131:28.29]Has this happened to you?
[131:32.41]It's an ornament.
[131:33.23]Okay.
[131:40.04]Has this happened to you?
[131:41.62]Yes.
[131:42.46]This happens very frequently.
[131:45.05]And it's always, I, I, I, I eat a lot of meals on the couch.
[131:51.63]I actually prefer sitting on the couch and eating things like dinner.
[131:55.98]I just feel like it's better that way.
[131:57.60]It's like, just, I love it.
[131:59.40]Just like, alright, I'm sitting on, I got, I have a table.
[132:05.12]But something about eating, just sitting on the couch is so good.
[132:12.38]Uh, hold on.
[132:12.90]I'm missing something here.
[132:20.69]What's up that on TV?
[132:22.66]If you got a TV there.
[132:30.36]What is the?
[132:34.04]What am I doing now?
[132:38.63]Let me pay attention for a second.
[132:58.00]Can I go up there?
[132:58.68]Alright, I gotta go up there.
[133:04.64]Yeah, sitting down, putting on... That's what I... I will tell you when I talk about, oh yeah, when I watch this other person's stream, or I watch this stream, or I watch a YouTube video, or a TV show.
[133:16.81]I wish I was making this up.
[133:20.79]I have been eating food every single time I mention this.
[133:27.90]I opened up a wall down here.
[133:29.18]I picked it up right here.
[133:30.95]It was right there.
[133:35.77]Where does it go though?
[133:36.79]Down here?
[133:40.99]What is this?
[133:42.03]Wait.
[133:42.65]I don't know.
[133:45.41]Blue door?
[133:50.07]Didn't I go in the blue door though?
[133:54.63]Yeah.
[133:55.43]Hold on.
[133:58.19]That's a very weird jump.
[134:03.09]This way?
[134:10.51]Cool.
[134:19.38]I mean, it's alright.
[134:20.92]It's alright.
[134:21.60]I don't love it.
[134:33.17]say I like it probably useful in some places yeah but I'm what I'm saying is every piece of media I've ever watched or ever consumed I had food in front of me
[135:04.89]What does this do?
[135:13.56]It is actually a parry.
[135:21.25]The parry block OK.
[135:23.73]Oh yeah, where did I put it in here?
[135:35.79]I put that somewhere.
[135:43.16]Ah, this goes up.
[135:44.76]Oh, right.
[135:45.80]Okay.
[135:46.40]Right, right, right.
[135:48.87]For some reason, I did not think this had three prongs.
[135:51.53]I thought it was one.
[136:04.21]It's a fork, man.
[136:04.99]Come on.
[136:05.27]Well, you didn't say Gwyn afterwards, so I don't understand what you wrote.
[136:07.87]Okay.
[136:16.45]Essence of a powerful and fearless soul.
[136:26.02]eating ice cream while moderating.
[136:27.87]You know what challenge I'd love to see?
[136:29.59]You know, you see speed running, no hit speed run, fastest time.
[136:33.83]I want someone to beat Elden Ring while holding a soft serve ice cream cone.
[136:37.67]And they have to like lick the sides.
[136:47.47]And by the way, you get points off for all the drips on your hands.
[136:54.84]How fast is the Elden Ring speedrun right now?
[136:56.52]Like 12 minutes?
[137:00.51]I think you could pull that off.
[137:14.52]A new category.
[137:17.32]Cone percent.
[137:27.93]Can we please have a hair cam?
[137:29.73]No, no, not tonight.
[137:45.36]What about a door cam?
[137:54.90]What about one naked cam?
[137:57.96]No.
[137:59.88]Didn't we talk about one time if... What was it?
[138:03.70]It was like, what would it be worth if I were to be, like, stream naked?
[138:09.90]We tried to come up with a number.
[138:11.12]Well, not stream, right?
[138:11.94]But, like, let's say I had, like, a platform where you could see me naked.
[138:16.14]And I remember people were like, what was the...
[138:22.78]Now, I'm not doing this.
[138:23.98]I'm just... We were making a stupid joke about this a year or two ago.
[138:29.17]And it was... How much money would I make doing that?
[138:34.73]Versus anything else.
[138:41.64]And you guys convinced me that it would be insane.
[138:47.28]And I was like, oh...
[139:00.40]You got to market it.
[139:05.57]It's literally free money, dude.
[139:08.27]No.
[139:18.50]Yeah.
[139:18.82]Oh, dude, it's like free money.
[139:20.78]Oh, hell no.
[139:21.36]I'd be so funny if you did that.
[139:23.06]Oh, my God.
[139:23.46]I'd be wicked funny.
[139:25.16]Yeah, I'd be laughing my ass off if you did that, Jerma.
[139:30.50]Please!
[139:30.92]Please!
[139:31.52]Please!
[139:31.98]Please God!
[139:32.86]Please if there is a God!
[139:33.68]Please if there is a God!
[139:34.44]He'll do it!
[139:34.96]Please if there is a God!
[139:35.68]I know what you're doing.
[139:37.68]You don't think I fucking see right through your bullshit?
[139:47.79]Alright, now where do I go?
[139:49.41]I got that soul thing.
[139:52.04]Can I go in this door?
[140:02.48]Crimson flames twist and dance around the door, keeping all would be trespassers at bay.
[140:09.86]Back to the bridge room.
[140:33.27]Bridge room is all the way around.
[140:34.37]Although, can I go left?
[140:36.75]Yeah, the green door.
[141:00.87]Shit.
[141:02.72]Where do I go?
[141:09.57]Climb this?
[141:10.07]I can get up there.
[141:15.57]I can definitely get up there.
[141:16.91]Shit, this is fucking hard.
[141:47.30]They wouldn't change the camera angle if you weren't supposed to be over here.
[141:53.48]Wall jump.
[141:55.00]It's kind of hard to do though.
[141:56.09]I'm honest.
[142:09.41]Jump up on the other pipe.
[142:10.47]I'm trying.
[142:36.04]My whole body wants to just move.
[142:37.72]Okay, what?
[142:42.32]I need to go into that little door, into that little crevice right there.
[142:49.85]It's just so... Those of you that played this game, you know how this jump is.
[142:55.81]It's like... I don't know.
[142:57.39]I can't even describe it.
[143:03.53]Alright, what the hell?
[143:06.11]Is that it?
[143:10.50]I got it.
[143:12.12]Is there nothing else for me here to go to?
[143:19.72]How do I get out of this?
[143:23.04]Let me see.
[143:26.73]Yeah, there's nowhere to... Wait, what?
[143:31.91]What?
[143:34.57]Is there another door?
[143:36.81]Where's the other door?
[143:43.52]There's the green one here.
[144:00.91]Other side of the fence?
[144:04.66]Go to the yellow door.
[144:05.64]You mean the one in... Hold on, I'm getting confused.
[144:08.06]I'm going to go up there.
[144:17.18]Thank goodness.
[144:23.35]Oh, thank goodness.
[144:23.97]Let's go.
[144:25.09]So I can...
[144:34.08]How would you have known you could do this without me literally reading it in chat?
[144:38.87]How would I ever know you could do that?
[144:45.47]You have to read it?
[144:48.32]I am the combat adjudicator.
[144:52.20]Only a technique I see cool to the core.
[144:54.68]Well, look what I got.
[145:21.51]Come on, I only have two moves to do!
[145:23.52]These aren't cool enough for you?
[145:32.06]There it is, okay.
[145:36.00]One more of those and I'm good.
[145:44.03]Here comes the Soul of Steel.
[145:47.32]Inside of every collectible pre-order box of Devil May Cry 4 is the Soul of Steel plastic toy.
[145:57.03]You could claim your own.
[146:02.19]It also comes with a 10 inch tall figure of Dante himself.
[146:08.31]What did I just do?
[146:09.77]Secret mission?
[146:10.47]Uh oh.
[146:24.57]I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.
[146:49.42]Oh my God.
[146:50.17]Let me get the sword out.
[147:01.22]Oh my goodness, okay.
[148:20.37]Oh my God.
[148:21.39]I had it.
[148:22.11]It just like, I fucking was in sludge.
[148:25.29]Oh, I was in sludge.
[148:32.24]I was in sludge.
[148:33.66]I, when you locked on and you walk, you walk, you don't run.
[148:38.52]And I just was walking in quicksand.
[149:05.18]I got it!
[149:07.40]Good.
[149:13.57]Orbs.
[149:13.83]Speaking of orbs, I just got a new one.
[149:19.99]Cool.
[149:26.22]Butthole is now a permitted term.
[149:35.65]for now until I, well, I just said that, so now it's going to be gone.
[149:48.98]What is this behavior?
[149:50.46]This behavior we're seeing over here.
[149:54.50]You guys supposed to be, you guys supposed to behave.
[150:03.29]All those orbs are missing.
[150:11.29]Ah, that sucked.
[150:16.92]Okay.
[150:18.98]Wait, I want those orbs.
[150:46.71]Try the parry.
[150:48.23]I think I'm probably gonna go back to Trickster.
[150:51.73]Having a dodge roll is just so, so good.
[151:03.68]That was not bad.
[151:11.60]You gotta be shitting me.
[151:26.56]That does a lot of meter or whatever you want to call it.
[151:43.12]They having fun?
[151:44.08]Yeah, no, this is great.
[151:44.88]I'll just hang out and play.
[151:49.04]I'm having a good time.
[152:07.97]Sorry, I'm paying attention to fighting.
[152:09.13]Am I supposed to get off?
[152:18.74]I need to kill them faster.
[152:20.00]They need to get off.
[152:25.94]Oh, shit.
[152:26.90]Okay.
[152:28.30]I got it.
[152:28.62]We're good.
[152:28.90]We're good.
[152:30.03]Let's go for it.
[152:31.25]They're weighing the elevator down.
[152:55.41]Oh my god!
[152:56.37]At the very least, I have to change the lock-on button.
[153:09.05]It's making my life a living hell right now.
[153:13.94]Can I do it through here?
[153:17.76]Please tell me I can do it through here.
[153:21.04]Thank goodness.
[153:21.54]Okay.
[153:22.48]Change target.
[153:24.34]What do I want to do?
[153:27.26]Item is up.
[153:28.48]Map is right.
[153:29.14]Okay.
[153:31.74]Change target.
[153:34.70]I don't know.
[153:35.22]What if I make that?
[153:48.52]Hmm.
[153:48.74]Hmm.
[153:54.26]I don't think there is a better button.
[153:57.24]Maybe one of the triggers?
[153:59.52]But I definitely don't want change gun to be left stick.
[154:08.01]Oh, that's not bad.
[154:11.59]Oh, that's actually not horrible.
[154:14.63]Actually, but I have to take my finger off.
[154:17.32]I gotta take my hand off the... Actually, it's not great.
[154:20.56]In theory, it seemed like a good idea, though.
[154:22.40]Appreciate the help.
[154:31.02]Honestly, even Right Stick would be better.
[154:40.51]I think I'm happy with Right Stick.
[154:46.19]Because then I can do...
[154:51.24]I think, yeah, that makes more sense to me.
[154:54.36]That's good.
[154:54.82]Alright, let's go.
[154:57.16]It's a hard game.
[154:58.60]Are you speaking in Simlish?
[155:01.45]No.
[155:11.57]Give me the shotgun for this too.
[155:12.65]I honestly probably shouldn't even lock on anybody.
[155:19.61]Alright, this is... This is very... You get knocked off the...
[155:45.62]Oh, God.
[155:46.74]Only use neutral inputs?
[155:48.20]I'm trying to knock him off with that, but that's probably a bad idea.
[155:52.07]I'm just going to stand in the middle.
[156:05.92]Just don't move.
[156:21.32]Die already!
[156:33.73]There we go.
[156:34.57]Finally.
[156:34.73]Took me long enough.
[157:00.61]Alright, all of you Devil May Cry lore masters.
[157:07.68]What should I realistically get next?
[157:18.10]Air hike.
[157:20.26]20k.
[157:21.36]Save for air hike.
[157:24.88]Hold on.
[157:25.58]Hold on.
[157:30.66]What if I got windmill part two?
[157:39.71]What does holy water do?
[157:42.57]Bend off demons.
[157:43.47]It severely damages enemies.
[157:45.73]What is a gold part?
[157:49.25]A magic golden stone made by a secret process can recall lost souls.
[157:55.51]Don't buy anything.
[157:56.31]Don't buy anything.
[157:56.89]Okay.
[157:59.59]It gets you drunk.
[158:01.68]It's an extra life.
[158:06.98]That sounds great.
[158:16.08]Items are for cowards.
[158:20.66]Look, brother.
[158:21.43]It's been ages, but we finally have company.
[158:24.61]I see that.
[158:25.89]We must entertain our guests.
[158:28.31]You're right.
[158:29.11]We have to be gracious hosts.
[158:30.55]What should we do?
[158:33.45]How do I know?
[158:34.23]We need to come up with something.
[158:40.91]Enough!
[158:41.94]2v1
[159:11.91]Oh, they are way smaller.
[159:12.97]I thought they were huge.
[159:45.77]Let's go, come on.
[160:13.02]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[160:33.89]Blocking should be illegal for the enemies to do in video games.
[160:54.57]Whoa!
[161:01.31]Ooh!
[161:15.85]Oh, who am I attacking here?
[161:18.85]Shit.
[161:24.18]I'm trying to just get rid of one.
[161:29.34]I'm dead.
[161:39.91]Alright, I gotta burn one down quick.
[161:50.09]Does it count that I... Alright, I gotta burn one down.
[161:56.83]Very, very fast.
[161:57.63]Gonna go with the green guy.
[162:42.25]Come on!
[162:59.10]Guard break!
[163:16.37]I thought I was dead.
[163:19.14]This is very hard.
[163:20.96]OK.
[163:22.14]OK, I got it.
[163:29.34]Oh, I could change my style.
[163:30.58]I'm not even using this thing.
[163:43.46]Alright, got one.
[164:30.21]Guard break, guard break!
[165:27.10]How do I heal?
[165:30.80]Alright, let's go.
[165:36.22]Uh, so they...
[165:48.08]alright this is not great I don't know okay thanks for the thanks for the heads up
[166:33.49]Get up!
[166:38.58]Got it.
[166:45.60]Phew.
[166:47.30]That was hard.
[166:48.32]Wait.
[166:49.66]Yes, wait.
[166:50.62]We have been waiting for a long time.
[166:52.88]Yes, a very long time.
[166:55.22]For someone stronger than us.
[166:57.60]Someone who can control us.
[167:00.67]My name is Agni.
[167:02.37]And my name is Rudra.
[167:04.41]You shall take us with you.
[167:06.23]We could be a great help to you.
[167:12.59]Okay.
[167:13.89]But on one condition.
[167:15.41]What is it?
[167:16.23]Name it.
[167:18.06]No talking.
[167:19.28]Fair enough.
[167:26.13]No talking?
[167:30.51]Whoa, these things.
[167:31.39]Alright, I want to use these.
[167:32.47]I don't care what any of the weapon is.
[167:36.67]These look cool.
[167:42.08]Impressive.
[167:45.42]No talking.
[167:52.38]I don't know.
[167:53.04]I think I would want to.
[167:56.26]I would want to talk.
[167:57.52]Don't you think you'd want to ask a few questions?
[167:59.47]Just pass the time a little?
[168:01.89]I would be the annoying one to them.
[168:07.73]Fire and tornado.
[168:12.87]Okay, you can only have two different weapons at a time.
[168:14.69]Got to change it up.
[168:19.75]Okay.
[168:24.91]So what do I have on?
[168:25.79]I can't change that now, right?
[168:41.40]I'll try it instead of the sword.
[168:42.30]Alright.
[168:48.71]That had to have been much better.
[168:50.73]What?
[168:52.77]Yep.
[168:54.94]OK.
[168:57.20]Alright.
[168:59.50]Hey.
[169:01.06]I got the orb.
[169:01.56]That's all that matters, right?
[169:10.89]Hey dude, do you want us to disable the tweet command?
[169:13.45]Because you, yeah, I mean, I just have to tweet anything else.
[169:19.02]I might just write.
[169:19.72]I don't know.
[169:22.04]I'm writing like, oh, hello.
[169:24.73]Oh, hi.
[169:25.75]As a tweet.
[169:27.79]Wow.
[169:34.83]Tweet about the Lakers game.
[169:36.51]Be like, I can't, I can't fucking understand what's going on.
[169:41.09]Just pull out like five random players and be like, I don't know what fucking happened there.
[169:46.44]The three pointers tonight from, they weren't very good.
[170:07.93]What is, is that a cannon?
[170:10.50]That thing looks pretty crazy.
[170:43.25]There it is.
[170:44.04]Yeah, that's what I want.
[170:45.52]I want a cannon.
[170:46.46]Hope I can get this item.
[170:47.26]This is a PS2 game.
[171:02.35]Was 3 still in the PS2 era?
[171:06.29]That's kind of remarkable if that's... Is that real?
[171:11.96]Wow.
[171:15.81]It does look like a PS2.
[171:17.11]I was wondering.
[171:17.80]The cutscenes are a little scratchy around the edges.
[171:22.10]I was wondering.
[171:28.00]Yeah, that's PS2.
[171:29.86]That's kind of unbelievable.
[171:33.83]Alright, well, I'm definitely going to try... Let's try these.
[171:50.66]I'm gonna buy these until I have no more money left and then turn my power button on my computer off until I turn it off.
[171:56.78]And then just leave.
[172:09.51]I want to test these out.
[172:18.03]So you put them together.
[172:18.81]Do they have a backswing move?
[172:23.23]I guess I could go look, right?
[172:36.94]Okay, so... Why, why, why, why, why, why?
[172:41.24]Why pause?
[172:43.66]Why, why?
[172:49.67]Why pause?
[172:50.71]Why pause?
[172:51.95]Why?
[172:52.21]And then just in midair.
[173:02.68]Forward on the stick and why?
[173:04.42]I still have this.
[173:12.80]So type three combo is what I have to use this with.
[173:18.47]I need to do Y, pause, Y, pause, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y. Let's try it.
[173:20.96]Is that it?
[173:21.88]Yeah.
[173:53.19]after the second pause.
[173:53.89]Oh my goodness.
[174:00.68]That's insane.
[174:11.66]The regular combo is good too.
[174:20.05]Hold on, second pause.
[174:20.95]Why pause?
[174:21.83]Why pause?
[174:32.12]The upgrades make this weapon fun.
[174:33.98]Okay.
[174:38.36]Can I move this?
[174:38.88]Okay.
[174:58.46]Whoa, where did those come from?
[175:00.12]I don't think I have enough.
[175:11.35]I could try though.
[175:15.35]Jet stream level two.
[175:20.26]Should I get air hike for this?
[175:27.69]Did you tell your mothers Happy Mother's Day?
[175:29.73]I did.
[175:32.17]Passing one trial still shows lacking.
[175:34.94]Passing two expands horizons.
[175:36.56]Passing all three unlocks true potential.
[175:41.24]Your wisdom we put to the test.
[175:45.06]OK.
[175:47.78]Your technique.
[175:48.52]Put to the test.
[175:52.71]And then your warrior's heart.
[175:57.11]What did it test?
[176:01.23]Well, we're gonna go here.
[176:03.42]See how smart I am.
[176:11.00]Alright, that was easy.
[176:40.65]In a game scenario, this is actually hard to do because... I think these enemies are just horrible.
[177:46.11]I wanna start this room over, actually.
[177:49.46]Yeah, start over.
[178:10.19]Alright, so these have little lit this.
[178:12.21]This is one.
[178:12.61]4.
[178:12.85]And then three.
[178:14.11]This is 1234.
[178:14.47]Read the hint.
[178:35.35]Use your lifetime experience from the crawling infant to the man standing tall and finally the old man leaning on his cane.
[178:42.61]OK.
[178:49.78]Infant tall man.
[178:52.80]Old man.
[179:02.11]Infant.
[179:19.89]Infant what isn't one of these is an infant
[179:37.57]He's already seen it in chat.
[179:38.82]It's too late.
[179:39.46]Yeah, it's too late.
[179:41.48]Yeah, I was pretending to walk around and not know where I was going.
[179:46.18]I was like, okay, infant tall man.
[179:49.38]Where?
[179:49.70]And I've read it a minute and a half ago, at least.
[179:59.70]Hey, look at that.
[180:00.70]There it is.
[180:01.28]I won't read chat anymore.
[180:15.89]OK, so I got an M. Was it a blue gem?
[180:26.71]What is that thing?
[180:34.33]So I got it.
[180:34.79]So can I just go wherever?
[180:44.67]Alright, I'm not going to reach out for this one.
[180:45.83]I'm just going to try to do it.
[180:48.69]Overcome the onslaught of obstacles to guarantee your future.
[180:51.13]Alright.
[181:08.50]Okay.
[181:25.47]Alright, so that's when you gotta go.
[181:26.41]Like right here.
[181:42.36]Oh my god.
[181:44.80]Wait, did those hit me?
[181:48.60]Those don't hit me.
[182:09.09]I thought the one's pointing down.
[182:10.01]We're going to hit.
[182:12.87]I got it.
[182:47.76]I gotta break it.
[182:48.40]There we go.
[182:52.34]Can I turn this back on and maybe get them hurt?
[182:55.87]I hate these fucking flying motherfuckers.
[182:58.15]I hate them.
[182:59.67]I hate these things.
[183:09.41]Once I attack one, another one's already attacking me.
[183:13.01]Oh my...
[183:17.29]I hate these fucking things.
[183:30.42]I have ONE HP!
[183:39.83]And- Alright, again.
[183:58.25]Wait.
[183:58.45]I already did it.
[184:01.90]That counts?
[184:02.72]Okay.
[184:15.12]Does this have anything that I need to read?
[184:18.78]Light all the crests.
[184:20.42]I think this is just a fight.
[184:27.23]Dying is actually a speedrun strat, that's funny.
[184:29.28]Okay, let's go.
[185:21.54]Whoa, look out!
[185:29.25]Stop blocking!
[185:34.23]Oh my god, all this guy does is block!
[185:35.53]I think I have to turn these on.
[186:28.18]Oh, he's at S2.
[186:28.75]Shit.
[186:29.17]Is it on a timer?
[186:59.50]I need to do that move.
[187:03.13]Why pause?
[187:03.99]Why pause?
[187:04.84]Why pause?
[187:32.83]What the fuck?
[187:33.49]I'm not gonna lose.
[187:38.71]I have to sit here and practice this move until I can do it without thinking about it.
[187:46.76]Why?
[187:47.12]Pause.
[187:47.52]Why?
[187:47.86]Pause.
[187:48.24]Why?
[187:48.62]Pause.
[187:52.55]Like that, right?
[187:58.03]Why?
[187:58.33]Pause.
[187:58.79]Why?
[188:03.58]I have to get this down.
[188:04.40]Otherwise, I'm just going to take the weapon off.
[188:10.76]Why?
[188:12.06]It's why, why, why?
[188:20.73]That's it there, but I want to do the thing where you spin him around like crazy.
[188:23.59]Okay.
[188:32.25]Yeah, why pause?
[188:33.27]Why pause?
[188:33.93]Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
[188:34.99]That's what I'm doing.
[188:35.91]It won't work.
[188:36.35]It's longer pauses?
[188:42.96]Yeah.
[188:58.90]You're doing Y, pause, Y, Y. Y, pause, Y, pause, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y. Yeah, but aren't I supposed to mash after the second pause to do the follow-up?
[189:26.75]I feel like I just did the same thing.
[189:38.48]Alright, so it's... Okay, it's much slower.
[189:59.52]Okay.
[190:03.17]I think I got it.
[190:03.67]Alright, let's do it.
[190:11.88]If you're playing at 60 FPS, you have to mash really fast.
[190:15.76]Oh.
[190:29.49]Is that actually true?
[190:30.27]Okay.
[190:37.77]Why pause?
[190:38.51]Why pause?
[190:39.27]Why, why, why, why, why?
[190:53.29]There it is.
[191:16.82]Oh, that was it.
[191:18.70]You really don't want to do it for that long, though.
[191:29.26]You're just vulnerable.
[191:41.53]Okay, well, let's go.
[191:52.52]So I need to light these up, right?
[191:55.93]Focusing on trying to learn how to do that move and not play the game.
[192:26.90]Whoa.
[192:27.28]Alright, let's go.
[192:49.04]Watch out.
[193:03.24]Come on!
[193:16.42]Oh my god, those guys are fucking horrible!
[193:31.25]I might die again.
[193:41.60]Jesus.
[193:51.63]They're powered up.
[193:53.71]I gotta get powered up too then.
[194:07.28]They're invincible unless I spin the wheels.
[194:09.12]That's what I was thinking too.
[194:10.49]I was like, why are these guys so fucking horrible?
[194:13.67]It has to be something to do with this goddamn wheel.
[194:46.26]Much better.
[195:00.53]Alright, I think I can't hurt them again.
[195:08.72]Yep.
[195:31.26]There we go, I feel much better about this now.
[195:44.43]Alright, last part.
[196:04.71]Hit it!
[196:06.42]I'm so paranoid they're gonna hit me.
[196:38.42]Oh my god, you're the worst enemy in the fucking game.
[196:45.43]You're worse than the bat... whatever they are, the bat thing.
[196:50.35]Shit.
[196:50.49]Didn't do it fast enough.
[197:02.06]Am I hurting him?
[197:04.24]Whoa!
[197:05.30]No, get out of the way, I wanna hit this thing.
[197:20.46]Holy shit, that was really, really wacky.
[197:28.64]Somebody said finally.
[197:34.81]Ban that person.
[197:36.91]Or.
[197:39.53]Let's go all in.
[197:41.79]A month.
[197:48.04]And now what?
[197:53.17]Passing one trial still shows lacking.
[197:55.15]Okay, so I did three, right?
[197:59.11]Where do I put them?
[198:06.29]They go in like a thing?
[198:11.76]Ooh, alright.
[198:17.54]Do I want this on the regular sword?
[198:26.89]I don't know.
[198:32.05]These are fun.
[198:36.65]It's for any weapon.
[198:37.41]Oh wait, it's for every weapon.
[198:38.87]Does it carry over?
[198:39.93]I'll get used to these.
[198:47.85]I feel like these are going to be better.
[198:48.79]I'm sticking with these.
[198:53.21]I got to get used to it and maybe it'll be better.
[198:57.15]Alright.
[199:00.45]Double jump.
[199:08.45]Oh wow, that makes this so much better.
[199:13.61]That's amazing.
[199:17.11]OK.
[199:27.41]So I did that.
[199:28.13]Put them all in.
[199:34.23]Okay.
[199:53.24]Ooh.
[199:54.96]A gun of the demon world that discharges arrows.
[199:58.20]Oh, it's a gun.
[200:01.20]Ooh.
[200:06.95]I'll try it.
[200:07.57]Ooh.
[200:26.58]Oh, okay.
[200:40.16]Thank you.
[200:40.50]Is it Gunslinger gun?
[200:44.36]Otherwise it's not great.
[200:49.34]Oh, look it.
[200:49.78]I only have 700 orbs.
[200:50.24]That's not a lot.
[200:58.68]I'm playing on Trickster.
[201:10.18]Well, well.
[201:15.66]You've grown stronger.
[201:18.39]Go to hell.
[201:20.07]You point a gun at me?
[201:22.61]Your own kin?
[201:24.81]Your dear papa?
[201:27.23]the only family I ever had was my mother and she's dead you break my heart after all it was I who gave you your name my darling daughter
[202:01.18]One day a game or a movie will have that happen, but it'll hit him right in the face.
[202:19.83]Plenty of orbs.
[202:21.21]I got plenty of orbs.
[202:26.20]Imagine getting a bee because you didn't use any items and collected all the stuff.
[202:56.10]You got a B for perfect attendance?
[202:59.33]That's what it feels like.
[203:28.17]Here I am trying to help you, and you show your thanks by shooting me?
[203:38.68]Whatever.
[203:39.58]Do as you please.
[203:46.26]So he's a demon too.
[203:50.07]I'm beginning to think I've got rotten luck with women.
[204:00.21]OK.
[204:05.09]Uh.
[204:07.42]I try these.
[204:09.06]I'll give it a try, see if they're any good.
[204:13.06]Alright, let's take a few break.
[204:13.86]I'll be right back.
[204:16.74]Come back and play some more.
[204:17.41]Did anybody know how how long is this game?
[204:21.35]The first one was like 8 hours or so.
[204:24.29]Are they all kind of like 7 to 10?
[204:30.37]It's 20 missions, 20 chapters.
[204:34.93]Just was curious.
[204:36.96]I will be right back.
[204:42.46]I can't really alt tab, so you're going to have to be left with this on the BRB screen, unfortunately.
[204:49.21]Well, it didn't matter.
[204:54.11]I will be... Will this work?
[204:55.99]Let's see.
[205:00.01]Nope.
[205:01.43]Alright, we're back.
[209:37.85]What is going on?
[209:39.09]What's up?
[209:43.83]Turn this back on.
[209:45.43]Oh, now you can hear it.
[209:46.11]There we go.
[209:56.53]Oh, I forgot.
[209:57.01]I was supposed to, I gotta clear my throat before I say anything.
[210:04.15]I ordered a door cube years ago with your promo code.
[210:06.56]I still haven't received it.
[210:14.66]Yeah.
[210:15.08]I don't think I can't afford anything either, so I'm going to go.
[210:28.23]Try the new weapon.
[210:36.05]Can I charge it?
[210:36.65]Let's find out.
[210:53.06]Normal shot.
[210:55.38]I guess not.
[210:59.26]I guess it's just a regular shoot weapon.
[211:13.05]Whoa.
[211:20.48]Need to level Gunslinger.
[211:24.42]That would make sense.
[211:30.61]There's 20 missions in every Devil May Cry except for one and five.
[211:35.63]Okay.
[211:36.63]Good to know.
[211:40.07]Oh, okay.
[211:40.47]Oh, this way.
[211:40.97]Where am I going?
[211:45.97]Is the quesadilla just a really thin taco?
[211:52.57]You're asking the real questions tonight.
[211:59.05]I think, no, I don't think so.
[212:07.91]Sorry, I was reading chat.
[212:11.30]Wait, whoa, whoa, there's a lot of stuff down here.
[212:13.12]Look at this.
[212:17.04]Look at all these orbs!
[212:17.74]I gotta get all these.
[212:19.64]What else is up here?
[212:45.49]He's going all the way up.
[212:55.23]There were at least five people that said to ban that guy.
[212:57.41]I'm also realizing something very important about myself.
[213:13.70]I need these to be switched.
[213:16.04]And I've been playing for like three and a half hours already.
[213:19.64]But... I have to change this.
[213:35.97]Okay.
[213:38.55]Makes way more sense to me now.
[213:45.50]I can't believe that guy got banned for a month for what he said.
[213:48.04]I know.
[214:21.65]Damn it Damn it wish that staggered
[214:58.76]You're bad at chess.
[214:59.76]Yeah, I am.
[215:01.40]I know that.
[215:08.69]Ooh, nice.
[215:10.91]Hey, did the Lakers lose?
[215:15.29]Baby?
[215:22.24]Did they?
[215:24.40]What if somebody T-voted, though?
[215:26.12]I don't want to spoil it for them.
[215:30.46]Right?
[215:30.61]If somebody T-voted, we don't want to... They might want to watch it later.
[216:03.30]Oh, get out of that.
[216:13.40]That's a lot of fucking people.
[216:24.65]Dude, come on.
[216:33.71]I just got full health.
[216:43.86]You guys are all standing in a 5 foot square around each other.
[216:52.10]Can't get in there.
[217:28.06]I just went right into it
[218:14.66]watch out dude jump x jump x jump x okay those guys had a trillion health secrets
[218:46.94]You can only do the double jump when it's active.
[218:49.87]That makes sense.
[218:50.53]I get it.
[218:50.79]I thought this person said you have a Super Bowl under your chair.
[219:09.82]Trying to figure out what the hell that was supposed to mean.
[219:16.02]magic essence oh I can't get into this one damn it
[219:48.03]Alright, so this is where the elevator is.
[219:49.09]That's the elevator control power panel.
[219:52.67]I gotta go put that thing... that other gem in that slot.
[220:13.08]No?
[220:24.67]That doesn't go there.
[220:29.92]Palm's Flames.
[220:31.06]Ooh, I know where that is.
[220:33.24]Can I go back to there?
[220:34.06]There's a door with a fire on it.
[220:35.98]I think that's where I gotta go, alright?
[220:44.15]Come on, wimp!
[221:06.63]Okay.
[221:13.59]So... Where is that place?
[221:21.64]Can I even get back there from here?
[221:38.68]I think I'm going the right way now.
[221:55.39]I hope so.
[221:55.85]Is this the Steam?
[222:02.17]Yeah, this is the PC port.
[222:03.49]Part of the HD collection.
[222:16.86]Honestly, this is my favorite weapon so far.
[222:19.80]I think it's the best one.
[222:35.30]Yeah, I like it the most for sure.
[222:50.96]back to the elevator that I was thinking of doing will you do anything else besides the third game I I probably will just play them all at some point I have to imagine they're not particularly long games not like it's like oh my god it's gonna take me like a month to beat it
[223:19.57]Couple of streams per game, probably.
[223:22.39]That makes sense to me.
[223:22.97]Alright, so that's a power source for the elevator.
[223:41.12]Just skip two.
[223:42.94]I feel like everyone's telling me how bad two is.
[223:46.27]Everyone's like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[223:47.77]Get away from two.
[223:48.67]Don't play two.
[223:50.61]I almost want to play it because I keep seeing people say such awful things about it.
[223:58.38]Could I go into two with the mindset of I'm going to play it for an hour and just not care?
[224:04.14]Would that be okay?
[224:11.49]And look, if I play it and I'm like, holy goodness, this is really awful.
[224:16.23]And I'll just stop playing it.
[224:19.49]Not a big deal.
[224:20.89]Alright, let's try to get a perfect here.
[224:41.30]Well, it was there, but I screwed it up.
[225:02.42]Stop.
[225:06.64]Oh my goodness.
[225:07.96]Does this game have any bathroom humor?
[225:22.41]Um.
[225:22.71]I don't think.
[225:26.19]so maybe no is that your criteria for if you're gonna buy the game or not where's the bathroom humor dude you're better than this
[225:54.52]It's more dad joke humor.
[225:55.80]I can see that.
[226:04.18]Devil May Cry 2 gets boring very quickly once you realize how effective bullet spam is.
[226:10.12]Just overall not fun encounters.
[226:16.84]Decent take.
[226:18.06]It's a good take, I think.
[226:21.85]What's bathroom humor?
[226:22.77]Stuff like this, like
[226:25.49]If I were to make a big... From your understanding, why are these games titled Devil May Cry?
[226:34.51]So, because I'm Dante from Dante's Inferno.
[226:41.00]And there's a demon that I'm going after.
[226:43.12]And I am so good.
[226:45.70]I am so... I am so talented and I'm so dangerous that the devils are... The devils are afraid of me.
[226:54.76]Oh, Dante's coming.
[226:57.11]He's going to kill us.
[226:59.17]Everybody get out.
[226:59.95]Like, that's what I think.
[227:00.97]Like, Devil May Cry.
[227:05.39]Because, whoa, Dante is very scary.
[227:16.71]That's how I've always viewed this.
[227:58.19]Even you can do combos like that if you play Ododate's Inferno 3.
[228:03.99]What's this?
[228:12.96]OK, I don't think I can.
[228:20.60]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[228:24.07]How do I get out of here?
[228:30.59]OK.
[228:42.49]Oh, it was actually that.
[228:44.79]I actually had to do that.
[228:45.73]I would have been stuck here for a while.
[228:56.56]Come on, Gwyn.
[228:57.60]Come on, Gwyn.
[228:59.20]I like that.
[228:59.68]That was a good chat.
[229:01.12]That was a good message.
[229:20.99]Did I do it?
[229:24.07]I don't think I did it.
[229:24.79]I don't know what I... Let's do it again.
[229:34.34]Okay.
[229:45.73]I think I have to break the statues?
[229:46.87]That's what I would be doing.
[229:55.35]Is it not smash into these statues?
[229:57.75]Do I just break the ball?
[229:59.16]Okay.
[230:17.30]It's glowing and cracked.
[230:26.84]I just heard that.
[230:47.05]That like child laughing sound effect.
[230:49.54]Oh, I get it.
[230:54.78]Alright.
[230:58.76]You guys know that the stock laugh sound, they're like, I can't do it.
[231:12.49]I'm fine.
[231:28.85]I want to see where I'm fucking swinging this thing.
[231:32.97]How do I get the camera to go this way?
[231:37.42]Popular stock sound effect.
[231:40.04]Is this it?
[231:44.14]There it is.
[231:56.87]You've never heard that before?
[231:58.41]No, no way.
[231:59.39]You definitely have.
[232:00.07]You just didn't process it.
[232:01.05]Alright, turn the camera!
[232:13.35]No, stop!
[232:13.91]I want to face this direction!
[232:17.83]Dante!
[232:19.62]Dante, please!
[232:28.17]I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it, but I'm not sure.
[233:01.43]Just hit it.
[233:01.91]I am.
[233:04.37]It's a it's not a physics puzzle.
[233:11.90]I'm not supposed to break the statues or break.
[233:28.76]Oh my God.
[233:34.25]I was saying that too.
[233:35.49]What?
[233:35.75]You guys told me I had to break the door.
[233:37.83]Alright, I'm never looking over here again.
[233:48.76]Oh my god.
[233:50.26]I don't want to do this again.
[234:26.28]How far away am I right now?
[234:27.34]What is going on?
[234:32.73]What's happening right now?
[234:33.93]What's going on?
[234:34.45]Where am I?
[234:35.01]Why did they put me all the way back here?
[234:39.93]He asked if it was hard and then a laughing face.
[234:43.26]Oh, it's over here.
[235:00.10]This is hard.
[235:03.67]Yeah, it is.
[235:21.83]Can I just... Do I have to do any of this?
[235:26.05]I guess I don't.
[235:28.85]Okay.
[235:30.63]Can I leave?
[235:31.15]No, I can't.
[235:31.45]I have to leave this.
[235:35.63]And how come they get to queue up a swing during the cutscene and I don't?
[235:40.15]Unfair.
[235:55.90]Oh my lord.
[236:11.90]Is there a mod to make the lock-on better?
[236:14.92]Can I please install one?
[236:26.49]Pushing in the stick to change enemies is driving me insane.
[236:54.98]Especially when there's so many enemies in a room to have to switch between.
[236:58.76]Having to press the stick in makes me want to throw up blood.
[237:06.05]And it picks a random fucking person.
[237:15.30]Okay.
[237:31.70]What a drama queen.
[237:33.18]It makes me want to throw off blood.
[237:34.76]This lock on is so bad.
[237:40.32]It makes me want to puke blood.
[237:41.92]Whoa.
[237:56.49]He's always so dramatic.
[238:14.80]I'm trying to think of any other... Hold on.
[238:19.72]This is the only scenario where you can talk like that.
[238:23.03]Right?
[238:23.21]This is the only scenario where you could... Where that people... I mean, it was a weird thing that I said.
[238:26.99]But in any other scenario, it's like, what the fuck is this person talking about?
[238:37.72]Can you imagine going to the doctor and you have like a wart on your finger?
[238:43.28]Hey, doctor, I got this ward on my finger.
[238:45.06]Let me take care of that.
[238:46.84]I can get that ward off.
[238:47.88]They're very hard, though.
[238:50.22]Oh, I can't.
[238:51.68]This thing's really giving me some trouble here.
[238:53.46]Hold on still.
[238:54.00]Let me just get that ward off.
[238:55.54]This is so hard.
[238:56.25]This makes me want to fucking puke blood.
[238:57.81]It's like, uh, alright.
[239:17.06]Didn't you have a ward on your finger?
[239:18.79]No, it was a gamer boil, and I want you to get it right.
[239:51.67]Get out of the way!
[240:22.91]Oh, fuck!
[240:59.43]Let me out of here.
[241:04.38]That made me just want to puke blood.
[241:19.93]What did I get for doing that?
[241:26.62]What was the point of this?
[241:30.42]I got the thing.
[241:31.44]What did I just pick up?
[241:37.90]What did I pick up?
[241:47.19]This thing right here, right?
[241:50.69]Now this goes in that other side.
[241:52.44]It has to.
[242:03.51]Gotta go back up this way.
[242:05.73]Back to where the elevator is.
[242:16.24]I gotta get these.
[242:18.36]It's time, finally.
[242:21.28]The people that are writing that, I just want to make sure you understand, I'm not going to tolerate it.
[242:27.41]Mods, what I want you to do, anybody that says, finally, I'm not going to tolerate it.
[242:32.75]I would like for you to start timing people out for exactly five seconds.
[242:37.91]Every time they say that.
[242:49.23]And if they do it again...
[242:50.66]Then I want you to time them out again a second time.
[242:53.02]Alright, I have to play the fucking video game.
[243:01.77]I gotta go all the way up.
[243:02.87]I just keep seeing things shining on... Hold on.
[243:11.31]It's the yellow door, right?
[243:29.24]Wait, can I actually... Can I go this way?
[243:38.70]No, where's that elevator?
[243:39.94]I kind of just appeared in this room.
[243:43.07]How do I get out of here?
[243:44.81]Over here, right?
[243:46.01]Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[243:46.85]Sorry, the camera was weird.
[244:09.40]And then I already got that.
[244:12.26]Stop doing that.
[244:12.66]What the hell?
[244:18.59]No, this is wrong.
[244:20.43]This is wrong.
[244:21.19]No, it's just right.
[244:21.91]It's right.
[244:43.87]Does it backswing?
[244:51.70]One, two, three.
[245:07.97]Oh shit, rematch?
[245:39.49]How do you pull off a guard break?
[245:40.87]Or is it just a certain amount of damage when they're guarding?
[246:02.39]Well, that does not work here.
[246:41.20]10,000?
[246:41.24]Why are you attacking him when he did nothing wrong?
[246:56.82]I had to... Hey.
[246:58.52]Sorry.
[246:59.25]I had to fuck him up.
[247:00.33]Okay?
[247:01.15]Okay.
[247:10.27]Oh, this is weird.
[247:49.37]Is it worth doing anything right now?
[247:50.51]Probably not.
[248:11.79]Yeah, it's alright.
[248:13.71]You probably need to be a gun specialist to care about it.
[248:20.79]Alright, this is the one here.
[248:22.35]It's definitely a boss.
[248:25.49]Am I happy with this?
[248:26.17]I like the nunchucks.
[248:44.49]Jet stream level two.
[248:56.55]Hmm.
[249:01.31]I'm not doing anything.
[249:04.35]Not yet.
[249:05.53]I'm kind of scared.
[249:06.37]What's through this door?
[249:06.99]Let's find out.
[249:29.75]Is this the fight?
[249:59.94]You showed up.
[250:07.29]You sure know how to throw a party.
[250:09.84]No food, no drinks, and the only babe just left.
[250:16.24]My sincerest apology, brother.
[250:19.05]I was so eager to see you.
[250:21.89]Somebody said, well, time to puke blood.
[250:24.76]Am I going to get mad?
[250:25.52]Uh-oh.
[250:26.72]How about a kiss from your little brother?
[250:30.72]Or better yet, how about a kiss from this?
[250:41.97]So, this is what they call a heartwarming family reunion, eh?
[250:50.41]You got that right.
[251:35.40]I got this.
[252:32.78]I'm getting crossed up because I changed the... This is what happens when... Just kill me.
[252:52.05]Just kill me.
[252:52.53]Let me explain.
[252:53.05]Let me explain.
[252:57.44]So, the leftmost button...
[253:00.80]we all agree the leftmost button of the face buttons I'm talking a b x y whatever the leftmost button should always be attack right like just like swing weapon always it wasn't that I halfway through the stream changed it to that and now I'm getting crossed up shooting when I'm swinging and I should have just done it I should have fixed it in the very beginning
[253:47.46]Yeah, yeah.
[254:17.17]X, X, X, it's not Y to attack, it's X. Hit X. Sometimes I'll be like, jump, Y. It's like, why did you do that?
[254:26.29]Blood.
[254:35.00]Imagine you, imagine saying that.
[254:38.60]You, you, you, blood, you go, blood, oh, blood.
[254:45.49]That wasn't even a good one.
[254:46.52]That one sucked.
[255:40.30]Oh my goodness gracious.
[255:49.53]Where is it?
[255:50.05]Where is it?
[255:50.53]How do I just do it again?
[255:51.73]Where is that?
[255:52.09]How do I hold down like R to restart?
[256:28.17]Alright, I got it.
[256:38.25]How did you hit me from all the way over here?
[257:36.72]Oh, shoot him.
[258:37.91]Why do you refuse to gain power?
[259:05.41]The power of our father, Sparda.
[259:09.24]Father?
[259:12.30]I don't have a father.
[259:17.17]I just don't like you, that's all.
[259:35.65]Oh.
[259:37.71]Oh, we saw this.
[259:40.89]Foolishness, Dante.
[259:44.61]Foolishness.
[259:48.13]Might controls everything.
[259:51.23]And without strength, you cannot protect anything.
[259:57.61]Let alone yourself.
[260:22.85]I'm back.
[260:27.46]Both arms out.
[260:28.20]Do you finally have it?
[260:39.43]Yes.
[260:41.19]Now the spell spotted cast will be broken.
[260:54.93]That's not the end of the game, so what happens?
[261:02.50]I see a devil inside you has awakened as well.
[261:09.02]Wait.
[261:13.01]We should leave.
[261:13.67]For the moment we have all that we need.
[261:35.37]Lucifer spoilers.
[262:06.47]I got that so wrong, it's not even funny.
[262:23.32]Alright.
[262:27.84]Hey, I'll take a beat.
[262:54.01]He's boring.
[262:54.99]Beef of boring.
[262:55.97]I'm doing style.
[263:59.08]Oh no, not these.
[264:00.00]I hate these.
[264:39.50]Why don't you fight like this?
[265:05.88]Too hard.
[265:25.93]OK.
[265:28.55]Intrigued.
[265:33.11]I'll keep what I got.
[265:36.26]I kind of want to upgrade these though.
[265:45.99]I'm doing it.
[265:57.51]At least once.
[265:58.91]I might even do it twice.
[266:02.89]That probably was insane what I just did.
[266:05.35]You probably just are.
[266:06.33]You can't believe what just happened.
[266:09.94]I'm doing it.
[266:20.88]How is this still level 1?
[266:22.48]I'm still level 1?
[266:25.50]I gotta get to level 2.
[266:47.13]Devil Trigger, unleash Dante's true power.
[266:51.04]me three gauges to transform into demon form okay so it's left bumper and you're pressing hold left bumper alright that sounds kind of cool let's give it a try I'm gonna find these
[267:20.05]Dante is infernal.
[267:27.35]Puzzles like these mind-bending puzzles await you.
[267:34.17]Get your pre-order in now.
[267:35.75]What was that?
[267:54.18]Knock it off.
[267:56.52]I have not heard knock it off.
[267:58.78]Knock it off.
[268:02.41]I've not heard that in a very long time.
[268:05.51]That's like the boys are over for a sleepover and we're talking a little too loud.
[268:10.39]And your mom, you know, it's kind of late.
[268:13.53]You hear it.
[268:14.53]Hey, knock it off, boys.
[268:16.67]Oh, okay.
[268:17.45]Okay.
[268:21.03]Knock it off.
[268:21.73]It's getting late.
[268:31.39]Knock it off.
[268:32.61]I love that.
[268:33.29]I want to start using that.
[268:37.33]Where are the rest of them?
[268:55.35]This is open.
[269:00.14]Hey, settle down.
[269:02.36]Settle down.
[269:02.92]Hey, settle down.
[269:03.52]Uh-oh.
[269:18.43]Wait, what?
[269:37.86]Just don't fall off.
[269:40.08]Oh.
[269:41.10]Oh no.
[269:42.38]I can't hurt them.
[270:09.57]Think I have to knock him off.
[270:24.68]Knock it off.
[270:37.60]OK.
[270:39.96]The issue that I'm seeing here is.
[270:45.59]What was that move that I just did?
[271:12.19]I tried to hold it but I can't.
[271:16.43]I got knocked out of it.
[271:19.09]I held it down and it didn't do anything.
[271:35.01]Oh.
[271:45.07]Is that good?
[271:51.28]This is a secret mission and I don't really want to do it.
[271:59.97]What?
[272:00.29]OK, I'm pressing.
[272:01.01]Do I have to have three to turn it on?
[272:02.95]What can I do with one?
[272:03.87]Do I have to have all three turned on?
[272:08.43]OK, so all three have to be activated.
[272:10.64]It's the only way I can hurt anybody.
[272:17.69]OK.
[272:25.92]This mission is awful and so you're really powered up.
[272:28.52]Yeah, how do I do?
[272:30.02]I'm gonna die.
[272:30.60]I'll just wait.
[272:58.13]Yeah, yeah, kill me, kill me.
[273:15.53]Well, I'm not doing that one.
[273:17.99]It seemed pretty painful.
[273:28.44]I get up here?
[273:30.00]I think I can get up here.
[273:35.60]Is this where I started or something?
[273:52.65]Alright, there's one more of those things.
[273:56.83]Where is it?
[274:38.92]the second door over here.
[274:40.10]This is where I came from.
[274:43.71]I have no idea where this is.
[275:01.22]I have to break it.
[275:12.20]Is he trolling?
[275:14.82]No.
[275:17.09]Where do I even go?
[275:25.75]In the cave?
[275:26.49]Wasn't I just in here?
[275:31.84]I hit this one.
[275:33.46]Then I went this way and I couldn't go anywhere else.
[275:41.71]I can get up here?
[275:42.43]Alright.
[275:43.62]The heck?
[276:16.47]I wish I could move the camera so bad.
[276:18.05]I feel like Lakitu is behind me.
[276:30.03]If anybody knows what I mean by that.
[276:52.76]What is that?
[276:59.89]I spent all my money on frivolous things that I didn't need.
[277:21.83]Oh dear, this does not look good.
[277:27.02]An organ writhes ferociously on the other side of the membranous wall.
[277:32.16]Can't get any closer.
[277:32.96]It scared the shit out of me.
[277:53.80]Go why I can't run any faster than this.
[277:55.69]Come on.
[278:26.90]Whack him.
[278:30.32]He just got whacked.
[279:05.63]probably stinks in here yeah I would I would I would I would almost say I would hope so
[279:48.34]I just got triple S. I've seen that before.
[279:56.75]Alright, I think this is the big scary boss part.
[280:07.60]Oh.
[280:23.87]This is a weird zone.
[280:34.28]We'll make fry.
[281:11.80]Come on man, let's go!
[281:12.98]What?
[281:23.51]Finally!
[281:24.01]Holy shit.
[281:31.95]You love that spin?
[281:33.13]I do.
[281:34.65]I really do.
[281:35.13]It's so much fun.
[281:42.99]Are you talking about that one?
[281:43.85]Yeah.
[281:44.95]I like it.
[281:50.67]God damn it, I knew it was coming too.
[282:18.27]people here now.
[282:32.82]Oh, wait.
[282:34.50]I forget.
[282:36.34]It's all dark now.
[282:37.14]I don't know where I am.
[282:38.38]I think I'm on the right way.
[282:50.01]Yes, okay.
[282:55.56]Wait.
[283:07.51]No, I was told not to buy items.
[283:09.65]That would make me bad.
[284:02.23]Oh, the combo was going so strong, too.
[284:03.89]Oh, shit.
[284:46.39]Let's go!
[285:01.33]Shit!
[285:27.85]My face is itchy.
[285:49.02]Stop!
[285:49.88]Ah, shit.
[286:08.80]Oh, he just got me.
[286:12.35]Okay, this one's more about patience than anything else.
[286:55.68]Dial up!
[286:57.72]Oh, whoa, what'd I do?
[287:00.01]Oh, okay, cool.
[287:04.19]I can dash twice?
[287:47.49]Can I break through this if I hit it enough times or no?
[287:49.57]I think I have to actually hurt it.
[287:52.88]Can you read Jerma?
[287:55.92]How am I supposed to read the chat and look over here at the same time?
[288:14.68]What am I supposed to be reading?
[288:16.28]There's no text on the screen.
[288:17.70]You want me to look crazy?
[288:26.50]I need to get... Just kill me.
[288:39.91]I'm going to start over.
[288:42.74]I can't even...
[289:10.50]I wonder, should I kill both?
[289:12.53]Left and right first or not?
[289:42.18]I gotta clear the enemies out.
[289:49.50]There's too many.
[290:13.91]No, don't hit me from behind come on
[290:44.17]Is he alive?
[291:05.31]What?
[291:05.63]Oh, come on, dude.
[291:30.04]Oh my god!
[291:38.63]Don't, don't, don't.
[291:40.61]Please don't.
[292:01.54]Gah!
[292:41.91]Break it.
[292:44.57]Break it.
[292:51.32]Oh.
[292:59.84]Yes, sir.
[293:00.46]Let's go.
[293:02.70]Fear of this tower.
[293:06.25]Tim and Nick grew.
[293:08.93]A foundation that brought out fear.
[293:16.86]right one has less health I think the left one was a little more tanky can't you feel it the rage and agonies of the people those who were confined here with their desires for evil being unfulfilled it was all because sparta slapped stealing devil trigger world in their faces
[293:53.08]What's wrong?
[293:53.68]Yeah, it's still on normal.
[294:02.52]Late night stream, cozy.
[294:07.66]Just playing some game.
[294:09.38]Chilling out.
[294:22.05]Really?
[294:22.33]Nice.
[294:26.43]Alright.
[294:30.53]Haven't seen an A Stylus yet.
[294:32.67]How am I so bad with damage though?
[294:42.53]Damage at a D.
[294:58.85]It's how much damage I'm taking It's like 50,000 damage that sounds like a lot man, that's how much I've been taking I
[296:04.75]I would want to befriend the Leviathan.
[296:08.88]How would I do that?
[296:14.22]So this is the next stage.
[296:16.71]Wait!
[296:18.79]If you're asking for a date, forget it.
[296:23.59]Because I make it a point not to go out with women who shoot me in the head.
[296:26.75]Date a demon?
[296:30.08]I'm not that desperate.
[296:31.98]Besides, I really don't care for guys who stink like blood.
[296:41.61]You're right.
[296:50.03]What's your name?
[296:51.29]I don't have a name.
[296:53.57]Okay.
[296:53.87]Then what should I call you?
[296:56.21]I don't care.
[296:58.23]Whatever you want.
[297:01.33]Whatever, lady.
[297:02.01]Oh, man.
[297:03.05]Who counted on you anyway?
[297:23.55]I know I'm going to call them souls, but that's the way it is.
[297:34.56]I want it.
[297:37.53]This is the... I don't care.
[297:41.67]I want it.
[297:41.95]This is my favorite weapon.
[297:57.15]So I have a question.
[297:58.27]If my favorite weapon is the nunchucks, should I do Swordmaster?
[298:05.40]Will I get more if I do Swordmaster?
[298:07.22]Trickster's good, but... You can jump cancel with level 2.
[298:23.21]high energy stream.
[298:24.71]This is a low energy stream.
[298:26.57]You're going to have to level it up.
[298:32.77]Yeah, that's true.
[298:33.89]I'll stick with trickster.
[298:42.92]The game is very high energy.
[298:47.42]Yeah.
[298:50.34]But as long as I can turn, I don't know, if I can turn my brain off and focus a lot of times, I usually can do okay.
[298:57.41]I mean, D is still a passing grade.
[299:00.41]What time is it right now?
[299:04.93]11?
[299:05.01]Okay.
[299:07.17]Maybe at the end of this section, I'll call it for tonight.
[299:10.72]That'll get us on chapter 10, which is essentially perfectly halfway.
[299:16.70]Okay.
[299:19.86]I think that makes sense.
[299:45.28]Okay, they're not that bad.
[299:46.14]They're not as bad as I thought they were going to be.
[299:50.09]This feels kind of weird, but whatever.
[299:51.33]I think it's way better now.
[299:56.87]You're kind of... You're kind of quiet, aren't you?
[300:42.39]Don't!
[300:43.15]Okay, there's a little wind up there.
[300:50.62]Jeez.
[301:08.17]One more?
[301:08.51]Where is it?
[301:13.62]Is Virgil playable?
[301:14.92]I would imagine the answer to that question is yes.
[301:18.36]I don't know though.
[301:33.15]Wait.
[301:35.99]Is that a mirror, shine the light mirror puzzle?
[301:40.87]Is that actually here?
[301:42.05]Is this for real?
[301:44.30]This is really in here.
[301:48.32]Oh, well, alright, cool.
[301:55.90]Radiate the image sunken in the depth below to open a new path.
[302:02.19]It is a spin the mirror puzzle.
[302:12.61]How do I spin it?
[302:41.41]How do I turn them?
[302:53.86]Oh.
[302:56.39]I get it.
[303:07.33]Use critical thinking skills?
[303:08.63]Yeah, but I thought there was... I didn't know if there was a tilt button or something.
[303:12.26]Hit B on stuff.
[303:13.06]What does that even do for me?
[303:21.43]I got no money.
[303:46.26]Oh, I cannot go that way.
[303:58.45]What's for breakfast?
[304:02.19]Two sausage patties.
[304:04.19]Yep.
[304:05.21]Two sausage patties.
[304:07.57]And... Breakfast sausage patties, by the way.
[304:17.86]One fried egg.
[304:28.39]Three or four pieces of pineapple.
[304:40.30]Over medium.
[304:40.72]I don't like over easy.
[304:51.90]Alright, so a few pieces of pineapple, two sausage patties, one egg.
[304:56.45]This should be alright.
[305:14.98]All these things hurt you on the edge.
[305:32.74]You can extend that?
[305:50.51]I like hard boiled eggs, but I don't like them after a day.
[305:52.57]I used to eat them all the time.
[305:57.03]I would make a dozen eggs.
[305:58.19]I'd get a carton of eggs.
[305:59.47]Hard boil all of them.
[306:01.71]And I would eat two or three of them every single day for breakfast.
[306:04.79]And then sometimes I'd have another one or two later.
[306:07.16]This is when I was lifting.
[306:07.94]This is when I was going to the gym all the time.
[306:10.52]I would eat a lot of eggs and a lot of tuna fish.
[306:13.54]I used to eat tuna out of the can.
[306:16.04]As a snack.
[306:18.12]I'd go to the gym.
[306:20.10]And I would do, you know, back and biceps, right?
[306:26.91]And then I would eat a can of tuna when I just got back.
[306:39.94]Why do you meal prep hard boiled eggs?
[306:43.12]Hard boiled eggs are awesome for meal prep.
[306:45.66]They're great.
[306:46.66]They go with tons of stuff.
[306:48.30]They're really good.
[306:54.20]not cooked and hard boiled egg is boiled boiled egg stop lying I'm not I've talked about this like in an old video from like almost 10 years ago yeah anchovies I I you know what I talked about this a lot anchovies not anchovies sorry
[307:21.67]Sardines are really, really good if you can get over what it is you're doing, right?
[307:29.46]You're eating, they're just in a can.
[307:30.96]Did I just walk backwards while talking?
[307:36.58]No, I got it.
[307:44.30]Oh, there it is.
[307:44.86]Ambrosia.
[307:46.84]The most delicious of the gods.
[307:48.38]The most dessert that only the gods eat.
[307:52.47]Fruits covered in whipped cream and fucking marshmallows.
[307:56.44]Only the gods will eat this.
[307:58.16]And make sure it's been sitting out for at least 12 hours.
[308:09.23]And by the way, even when you're taking the fridge and three or four days go by, take it out of the container and just get the same.
[308:16.07]It doesn't matter.
[308:29.19]For the gods though little candied marshmallows So much bang
[309:04.05]Turn it on, quick!
[309:14.34]Who can forget to get it off him?
[309:19.69]Oh no!
[309:39.65]If you can get to an S rank combo, I will... Well, I'm not going to read the first part, but I want to tell you that I've done that probably 30 times already.
[309:47.13]So that's going to happen.
[309:57.17]Oh, I want to try something.
[309:58.07]Can we try something weird?
[309:59.90]It's going to take some effort here.
[310:01.76]I want to try something.
[310:06.64]So...
[310:08.98]This is a fun experiment that I've wanted to try for a little while.
[310:12.84]It doesn't work to this music, though.
[310:14.32]It needs to be a little more relaxing.
[310:17.58]I want the mods to record with, you know, to log all the responses.
[310:26.19]And I'm curious if there's a... I'm curious if everybody sort of has something that they really care about or something that they really want right now.
[310:34.49]And without thinking...
[310:37.73]What the fuck?
[310:38.23]What the fuck?
[310:38.61]No, no, no.
[310:39.05]Stop, stop, stop.
[310:39.49]Listen.
[310:40.63]This music is speech jamming me.
[310:41.95]Hold on.
[310:42.21]It's like... I... Hold on.
[310:44.32]Let me turn this off.
[310:48.34]Okay.
[310:50.36]So, when we think... I'm gonna say something and I want... After I say this, I want the mods to keep a record of what everybody says.
[310:57.86]Yeah.
[310:58.10]Just like a... Just what everybody's saying after when I say this.
[311:03.72]I want everybody...
[311:05.24]to right now think of so something that you a food item it could be a snack it could be a dessert something that you want right now so bad that you're craving right now that you not your favorite food but just what do you want right now what would just do it for you right now what would be that thing that would do it for you right now cool
[311:35.75]Yeah, not your favorite food, not, oh, well, my top 10.
[311:38.43]Just, you know what it is for me right now?
[311:45.39]An Italian sub.
[311:47.28]Just a cold Italian sub.
[311:49.04]I want it so bad.
[311:55.14]The reason why I wanted to do this is because I'm curious as to how many people here have the exact same Omega craving right now.
[312:10.04]You know what I'm saying?
[312:10.68]Because that's cool.
[312:19.13]How do you want us to log this?
[312:21.65]Um...
[312:23.52]Yeah, just copy and paste it to me.
[312:28.07]And did you have something?
[312:29.95]Let's say you were like, man, this is really specific, but I really want it.
[312:32.95]I want a piece of baklava right now.
[312:36.37]And did more than three or four people say baklava?
[312:38.93]Because holy shit, look at that.
[312:40.39]That's a pretty interesting connection.
[312:47.85]I thought about it because food is one of those things where you get these cravings.
[312:53.78]But right now, what do you want?
[312:57.19]Like, for instance, somebody said everything bagel.
[312:59.47]That's a perfect example of this experiment.
[313:03.83]Was there anybody else that said everything bagel?
[313:09.43]Put it on a spreadsheet?
[313:10.37]Yeah.
[313:11.83]Yeah, let's get it on a spreadsheet, and then I'm going to go over it on stream the next time.
[313:17.71]And how many people said certain things?
[313:21.28]Does pizza have 100?
[313:23.90]Does pepperoni pizza have 10?
[313:27.04]And what had the most?
[313:28.26]What had the least?
[313:30.19]Don't really need usernames.
[313:34.31]But the specific thing, that really specific thing that you wanted right now, I'm curious.
[313:40.60]We'll see how it works.
[313:47.01]You know what else I want to do?
[313:47.99]Here's another interesting thing.
[313:56.19]Going over your Steam game library in alphabetical order.
[314:02.76]Now, I'm one of those people that has... I have a lot of Steam games.
[314:06.24]I have a ton of Steam games.
[314:07.76]Pretty much every game you've ever seen me play on video or on stream, whatever, right?
[314:12.00]But a lot of them are not.
[314:13.04]A lot of them weren't.
[314:14.54]But go alphabetical on Steam.
[314:18.98]And pick out every single game that you've ever bought.
[314:22.30]That you've ever kept.
[314:24.24]Why?
[314:26.04]Like, how did you feel when you played that game?
[314:29.20]Why did you buy it?
[314:30.50]What did you think of it?
[314:32.43]Because there's a lot of weird, just random shit that I think a lot of people have bought.
[314:38.33]And did you beat it?
[314:39.55]Why didn't you?
[314:42.47]I think that's fun.
[314:46.19]I have like 200 games to laugh my ass off.
[314:48.44]Yeah, that's kind of cool.
[314:54.24]You need to start a Google survey.
[314:55.41]Well, I don't want you guys to all do this.
[314:57.59]I'm just saying maybe, I think it might be fun to do that on stream one day.
[315:01.13]Just go over them.
[315:07.01]have 800 games well it will take you a while but don't you think it's kind of interesting to go back and kind of look at especially if you have a steam account that's been more than a few years five plus ten plus years old you get to sort of look back and be like what the what the was I thinking back then what was the reason why I bought this and did I get what I wanted out of it I think it's interesting to do that or even like how do you feel even looking at the name of that game
[315:40.27]Nostalgia trip.
[315:47.69]We'll do one right now.
[315:48.50]Like Devil May Cry 3.
[315:49.44]Okay.
[315:51.14]It's a game that I got because I knew I wanted to play Devil May Cry.
[315:55.10]It was a fun hack and slash game.
[315:57.82]I never played Devil May Cry and it was interesting.
[315:59.48]I started with the third one and that's where I stopped because I never played any of these other games ever again.
[316:04.50]And I uninstalled this one at the end of this stream.
[316:08.51]Which is really interesting that I did that.
[316:10.89]Makes you kind of think about how you approach things in the future.
[316:25.78]Surprise pop quiz.
[316:26.92]Alright, well, maybe I need to look.
[316:30.27]Surprise pop quiz.
[316:36.29]Alright, what am I doing here?
[316:39.67]No, I'm having a good time.
[316:41.19]I'm kidding.
[316:45.79]7 Days to Die, me and my sister played it, and we were like, whack, but kept playing it because she loved zombie games.
[316:53.05]There you go.
[316:53.73]Exactly.
[316:55.85]Thank you for proving why the experiment is an interesting thing to do.
[317:00.76]Look at that.
[317:01.82]And didn't you do... How does that make you feel?
[317:04.30]Isn't that, like, interesting?
[317:05.96]I just walked in.
[317:09.92]Alright, I...
[317:18.36]Am I going the right way or am I just being an idiot?
[317:27.99]Did you just discover introspection?
[317:31.33]No, but when was the last time you looked at a Steam game that you bought like eight years ago?
[317:38.22]I mean, it's been a while.
[317:39.64]I'll stay on Trickster.
[317:56.60]Ooh, look at over there.
[318:00.54]I have a bunch of porn games.
[318:03.34]Well, we know exactly how you felt when you are... Do you need to even tell us that?
[318:10.35]How did I feel when I downloaded this one?
[318:12.69]Hmm, what was I doing?
[318:14.75]What was I thinking?
[318:17.09]Hmm, maybe... I guess this one was... Because I really wanted to fucking, you know...
[318:24.50]Have a little bit of me time.
[318:26.56]Oh, this one is too.
[318:27.52]This one's also me time.
[318:41.83]He's going off the rails.
[318:43.01]No, that was funny.
[318:55.85]I got this one because I wanted to fuck the cheeseburger sup.
[319:02.17]Yeah.
[319:05.67]I was laughing so hard at some of those conversations, uh, yesterday.
[319:09.23]It says, fuck, marry, kill for sandwiches.
[319:13.41]That's, that's so stupid.
[319:17.31]It was just, it was killing me last night.
[319:19.79]I was just thinking about how dumb that was.
[319:30.80]Those people that weren't here.
[319:31.84]Fuck.
[319:37.64]Very killed.
[319:38.74]How would you... Do I need to tell you that?
[319:42.63]I mean, this is a mature audience stream.
[319:45.91]Are you really asking me how?
[319:48.67]What do you mean, how?
[320:04.23]Hmm.
[320:05.81]Welcome, sir.
[320:10.39]Is this your first time here?
[320:12.71]Yeah, it is.
[320:15.20]You'll be nice to me.
[320:16.20]Hold on, wait, wait, we got one here.
[320:19.08]Of course I will.
[320:20.02]Fuck, marry, kill.
[320:20.72]Cold Italian sub, turkey bacon club, or tuna fish sandwich.
[320:23.96]This is easy.
[320:30.21]Now that's what I'm talking about.
[320:36.87]I think my game crashed.
[320:41.35]Millenia?
[320:42.57]Here we go.
[321:04.49]Oh, cleanse the bastard's curse.
[321:08.37]What's that from?
[321:10.47]First person gets a prize.
[321:11.73]First person that says it gets a prize.
[321:12.71]First person that says it gets a prize.
[321:18.66]Who got it?
[321:19.02]Who did it?
[321:19.46]Who did it?
[321:19.76]No, I'm serious.
[321:20.54]Who got it?
[321:22.84]Who was the first person to write DS3 or Dark Souls 3?
[321:26.16]Who got it?
[321:26.50]You're getting a prize.
[321:42.27]Dragon Breath 75.
[321:43.63]You just got a prize.
[321:44.67]Dragon Breath, congratulations.
[321:50.31]You just got a prize.
[321:54.86]What's the prize?
[321:55.42]Um, I'm trying to figure that out.
[322:10.80]Pick any game on Steam that's not Train Simulator and all the fucking $3,000 bundle and it's yours.
[322:18.10]It can't be like a $10,000 bundle of Train Simulator or something.
[322:20.90]Welcome, sir.
[322:21.44]Is this your first time here?
[322:27.83]Yeah, it is.
[322:28.45]Sims 4 and the $1,000 DLCs.
[322:31.47]Of course I will.
[322:40.08]Yeah, no pornographic games either.
[323:00.27]They want Pizza Tower?
[323:02.85]Done.
[323:13.08]Please allow, uh, please allow two to four months for delivery.
[323:19.26]No.
[323:19.38]Alright, how does this one work?
[323:23.36]I don't think I can hurt her.
[323:27.28]Alright, what am I gonna do?
[323:30.38]I gotta break something or do something here?
[323:36.38]I gotta break something, right?
[323:47.20]Alright, hold on.
[323:54.16]You got these, I have to like attack these things.
[323:59.52]Oh, there we go.
[324:24.89]No!
[324:34.96]Get out of here.
[324:45.09]Throw them all.
[324:45.69]That's fine.
[324:46.07]I'm going to die.
[324:48.97]I'm dead.
[324:49.69]Alright.
[324:49.99]I'm going to sit up.
[324:52.25]What's the best way to get the game?
[324:53.87]I'll figure it out.
[324:55.63]Let's do another one.
[324:56.35]Let's do another one.
[324:56.99]Alright, I'm going to say a line, and you need to get it right.
[325:00.41]And whoever gets it right gets a game on Steam, whatever you want.
[325:02.31]Alright, here we go.
[325:03.31]Ready?
[325:03.47]I don't know.
[325:26.46]No, that's so bad.
[325:27.56]Come on.
[325:39.00]Alright, I get so greedy here.
[325:40.34]It's stupid.
[325:46.01]Oh yeah, it is late.
[325:51.15]I'm so greedy with this fight.
[325:52.19]I don't even know what it is.
[325:55.15]I'm probably going to start over.
[325:58.59]I've been literally paying attention to like 10% of this whole encounter.
[326:03.39]Just kill me, I'll start over.
[326:06.09]Alright, I'm gonna hum a song.
[326:26.51]You have to get the exact name of the song.
[326:28.41]It has to be the exact name.
[326:40.20]No.
[326:40.42]My computer just turned off.
[326:48.72]Are we good?
[326:49.52]Am I still alive?
[326:54.88]That was weird.
[327:05.74]How did I get more health?
[327:09.63]I'm really confused.
[327:10.55]Wasn't I trying to die?
[327:11.49]I don't know what just happened.
[327:19.85]Greedy again.
[327:20.69]It's so annoying.
[327:29.87]Alright.
[327:30.37]Actually, just start over.
[327:33.29]Because I just keep looking over in chat and thinking about a song I have to hum.
[327:38.55]Let's do this first and then I'm walking in.
[327:42.15]Hit me!
[328:06.57]Okay.
[328:08.73]Category is... Old cartoons.
[328:26.60]What song is this?
[328:27.40]From what show?
[328:39.66]Cat dog, that's it.
[328:41.15]Who said cat dog?
[328:50.53]I will accept cat space dog or cat dog one word.
[328:56.16]That was Wolfie515.
[328:59.76]Pick a game on Steam.
[329:04.65]We'll get it to you.
[329:25.43]Latency difference?
[329:26.29]Yeah, that's true.
[329:27.11]Yeah, the advantage of, I guess, living in closer to the United States.
[329:37.36]Ping advantage.
[329:40.12]Resident Evil 4?
[329:41.16]Yeah, they're a good choice.
[329:56.68]Alright, time to pay attention, for real, honestly.
[329:58.82]I'm gonna turn the volume up for me.
[330:07.56]That's better.
[330:07.96]Hoo-hoo!
[330:16.07]Hoo-hoo!
[330:46.92]No!
[330:46.98]Stop running away!
[331:13.61]Stop running away!
[332:04.16]Dammit!
[332:06.00]No!
[332:40.53]God dammit!
[333:14.75]Oh my god, I forgot I had heals.
[333:19.41]I got another one for you.
[333:20.27]Last one of the night.
[333:20.97]Here it is.
[333:21.83]This is a sound effect, aka a voice line from a video game.
[333:25.17]It's an older video game.
[333:26.61]What game is it from?
[333:28.60]Ready?
[333:30.72]Ready?
[333:31.02]I'm going to type it into Mod Chat.
[333:42.52]Ready?
[333:42.80]Ready?
[333:49.02]Ready?
[333:51.18]No one's gonna get this.
[333:52.72]I'll win this one.
[334:00.26]No one's gonna get it.
[334:03.97]Ready?
[334:06.49]No.
[334:07.71]Not even close.
[334:08.27]Alright, I'm gonna give you the console.
[334:10.01]Because I think a lot of you are not in the wrong track here.

[334:45.60]Boss fights in Mischief Makers, every time they're about to hit you, at least one of the bosses goes, Ready?
[334:52.17]The bird.
[334:57.29]Alright, well, that was, I believe that was, we got to see who was first.
[335:15.71]Do we have to confirm who it was?
[335:22.35]You know what?
[335:22.71]Did only two people get that?
[335:28.06]Was there literally only two people out of 10,000 that got that right?
[335:39.92]It was multiple?
[335:41.28]Oh, okay.
[335:44.12]How many people?
[335:47.23]How many people was it?
[335:48.67]Any way to tell?
[336:01.66]After you said it, a lot of people said it.
[336:03.44]Oh, shit.
[336:11.44]I think it was kill the boss already.
[336:13.64]Yeah, I know.
[336:14.40]I got you.

[339:43.66]So there were five people that got it.
[339:51.35]Oh my god.

[339:58.31]Alright.

[340:09.48]But you're no slut yourself.

[341:08.47]Okay.
[341:11.25]The Nevan.
[341:12.83]Dante can control bats by jamming on this curious guitar.
[341:16.35]Its sickle attack is deadly.
[341:18.82]Ooh.
[341:22.30]I kind of want to try it.
[341:35.12]I'm starting to get it.
[341:36.98]I get it.
[341:37.92]I know why this is a very celebrated franchise.
[341:40.60]I get it.
[341:47.31]You gotta get it first and then... Gotta get into it.
[341:50.46]Anything else I can do here?
[342:09.06]Oh, but I want to make sure that people are still here.
[342:10.48]Apparently, five people got Mischief Maker.
[342:24.17]All five of you.
[342:25.65]What do you want?
[342:28.39]CEO.biz, SickMagics, Grimstone, BlossomBullets, and Reldrich.
[342:36.33]Whatever you want.
[342:51.04]Yeah, we're just fucking having fun.
[342:52.08]We're just having a good time.
[342:53.82]Why not?
[343:08.37]I still take way too much damage.
[343:09.77]Unfortunate.
[343:12.78]Unfortunate.
[343:21.51]I want you to pay the subs you owe us.
[343:23.79]Oh, that's right.
[343:25.27]My credit card kept getting declined from Twitch.
[343:28.65]And I just never did it.
[343:29.81]I tried it like five times and it never worked.
[343:35.82]That sounds like such bullshit.
[343:38.34]If you think about it.
[343:40.50]But I assure you it is not.
[343:42.91]That sounds like total, oh man, I tried, but my credit card just didn't go through.
[343:49.18]It's something, I don't know, something with their servers.
[343:54.40]But I promise you, it was real.
[343:58.10]Try it now?
[343:58.84]Um, it's a little late.
[344:08.62]Why does that matter?
[344:09.40]You know what?
[344:09.86]It's because I don't want to go get my credit card.
[344:13.64]We're about to end the stream.
[344:22.27]It's too late.
[344:25.49]Remind me when I turn the stream on again.
[344:28.49]We'll do it.
[344:41.79]Does that woman really bother you?
[344:46.55]What are you talking about?
[344:47.67]Are you going to give people the games?
[344:51.25]We'll figure it out.
[344:54.04]Did some pesky fatherly love get in your way?
[344:58.94]As long as it's on Steam.
[345:04.02]Oh, shit.
[345:04.60]To further your study of the black arts, you sacrificed your loving wife.
[345:10.65]to become a devil as well.
[345:14.25]Knowing this, I thought you'd be more useful to me.
[345:18.53]But I was wrong.
[345:23.07]No wonder your attainment of power is incomplete.
[345:28.53]What about you?
[345:30.61]You're an incomplete being as well.
[345:36.18]Both
[345:37.19]Demon and human blood mingle in your veins.
[345:42.98]Shut up.
[345:52.93]Now that the final door is open, I have no use for you.
[346:09.94]There we go.
[346:11.18]Mission 10.
[346:13.04]Alright, and that's what we'll call it.
[346:16.29]That is where we will call it.
[346:23.47]Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[346:25.99]The mods are already reaching out to people.
[346:28.63]Just a fun little thing.
[346:30.27]Not running like a contest or anything, right?
[346:33.81]It's just decided.
[346:36.05]Hey, fuck it.
[346:36.47]Let's do it.
[346:41.62]You got another 30 minutes in you?
[346:43.28]Uh, no, it's midnight.
[346:47.10]I think it's probably time to call it off.
[346:57.94]Mischief Makers, did I win?
[347:01.93]I'm sorry, but it is when it is when we could see it in the chat.
[347:09.13]It is when we could see it in the chat room over with first.
[347:21.56]Can you give us a good night?
[347:24.06]Yeah.
[347:30.79]I like these no-cam streams.
[347:34.56]Yeah, I'm telling you, there's a new philosophy here.
[347:38.52]Where I'm just going to do whatever I want.
[347:43.77]Right?
[347:45.25]Sometimes it's going to be Devil May Cry.
[347:46.53]It might be something else random.
[347:48.11]Then just hang out and play.
[347:51.05]Just chill.
[347:54.68]I much prefer being able to do stuff like this more often.
[347:57.96]Way more often.
[348:01.19]So more of these, you've already seen a bunch of them already, but we're going to continue to do these.
[348:13.42]So let's talk about the next stream.
[348:15.72]I'm going to finish Devil May Cry 3.
[348:19.54]I will be live on Friday.
[348:23.06]And we'll probably do Friday and probably Friday, Saturday or Friday, Sunday.
[348:31.05]I'll pick out a couple of days this weekend here.
[348:32.93]Friday, Sunday, Friday, Saturday.
[348:37.19]We will finish Devil May Cry 3.
[348:41.45]And then on either Saturday or Sunday, we will move on to... I don't know.
[348:48.08]I got a list of a bunch of stuff.
[348:50.72]This game was on a list.
[348:52.28]Yeah, it was on my list.
[348:54.12]All the Devil May Cries were.
[348:57.75]Oh yeah, the food result thing.
[348:58.91]I want to go over that on Friday too.
[349:10.83]I think we got everybody.
[349:11.89]Alright, I think we got everybody that said the name of the thing that I was saying.
[349:18.33]The food thing is going to be a challenge.
[349:19.58]Maybe we just dump it in like a word file.
[349:23.98]Doesn't matter.
[349:27.70]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[349:30.20]If you stayed up late, have a good night.
[349:32.78]If you're just waking up, have a good morning.
[349:38.54]And if it's in the middle of the afternoon, then get up and stretch.
[349:55.37]And that's it.
[349:56.56]See you guys on Friday.
[350:00.01]Great rest of your night.
[350:00.79]Thanks for watching.
[350:01.49]Devil May Cry 3, very hard.
[350:04.51]But, I get it.
[350:05.87]I get it.
[350:11.04]So let me ask you this.
[350:11.94]I know a lot of people here are probably big fans of this game.
[350:15.18]What's the best Devil May Cry in your opinion?
[350:18.04]What is the, is it this one?
[350:20.06]Is it 5?
[350:20.46]Is it 3?
[350:22.22]5?
[350:22.24]1? 1?
[350:26.39]There was a lot of debate in the pre stream of is five the best one?
[350:41.27]We need music.
[350:42.79]I got you.
[350:50.08]Gotcha.
[350:57.37]I got you right here.
[350:58.05]Hold on.
[351:12.47]Four is underrated.
[351:13.33]It's pretty good.
[351:17.48]Hanging out in offline chat earlier.
[351:18.84]I put a poll up to see what people were thinking.
[351:22.42]I think only two people voted for four.
[351:25.57]Out of a couple hundred responses.
[351:33.51]Yeah.
[351:39.61]Four is good, but five is just so much better.
[351:46.29]So what's the deal with the first one then?
[351:47.65]Because everybody said, no, no, no, no.
[351:50.77]Do not play the first one.
[351:51.77]It is way different.
[351:53.71]You're going to hate it.
[351:56.16]What's the, um, what's the deal?
[352:01.98]It's just very dated, very old.
[352:09.25]I mean, it's got to be, what, 2002?
[352:14.85]2003 or something for Devil May Cry 1?
[352:16.07]Or was that still in PlayStation 1?
[352:20.29]Or was it PS2?
[352:27.75]2001.
[352:27.89]Wow.
[352:28.77]It was originally Resident Evil 4?
[352:48.15]What?
[352:52.09]Hold on.
[352:54.10]I mean, you've got now I'm intrigued.
[352:55.92]I need to know what that is.
[352:57.52]It was going to be a Resident Evil game.
[353:00.10]That's cool.
[353:00.48]Alright.
[353:01.18]I kind of want to check it out.
[353:07.80]Same director as Resident Evil 2.
[353:13.96]RE4 had a lot of revisions.
[353:24.14]Do you have any advice on how to make a colonoscopy prep more palatable?
[353:28.28]You're talking about drinking the gross drink that makes you, like, shit for fucking three days?
[353:34.43]Um... Yeah, you know what I'll tell you?
[353:37.31]That's the worst part.
[353:41.57]That's actually the worst part.
[353:45.66]And that part sucks, don't get me wrong.
[353:48.98]But for a colonoscopy... Colonoscopy is not...
[353:52.82]That is simple.
[353:54.97]The procedure is simple.
[353:58.53]It's just that drinking the drink and eating the thing to clear you out.
[354:04.34]That's the actual worst part.
[354:07.28]So, you are doing the worst part right now.
[354:12.98]So when you're done with that and you get the few days you have to do it on that last day, just look in the mirror and go, now it's time for the easy stuff because it actually is.
[354:23.33]Yeah, it sucks, but you know, you got to take care of yourself.
[354:33.28]Do what you got to do, right?
[354:36.96]Do what you got to do.
[354:42.32]Thanks, Doc.
[354:44.20]Yeah.
[354:53.52]And then go get a large iced coffee.
[354:56.76]That's funny.
[355:02.26]I did say I was going to puke blood today.
[355:04.54]But that was just nonsense.
[355:08.62]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[355:09.52]See you Friday.
[355:10.06]Thanks for watching.
[355:12.37]Take care.
[355:13.25]Call your mother.
[355:13.67]I mean, especially if you didn't call your mother a few days ago, do it now.
[355:33.17]Have a good one.
[355:33.69]Good night.
[355:34.23]Goodbye.
[355:34.45]See you soon.
[355:54.74]you
