[00:07.06]Alright, I had to make a lemonade.
[00:08.00]I was really into a lemonade.
[00:11.66]Let's come back here.
[00:15.12]Hello, how are you?
[00:20.56]Let me go this way.
[00:21.44]Should be able to.
[00:26.18]Maybe not quite yet.
[00:27.42]Hmm.
[00:32.98]Uh-oh.
[00:33.84]I can't get this to show up.
[00:37.19]Uh-oh.
[00:41.59]Hold on.
[00:44.31]There we go.
[00:52.02]All right, cool.
[00:56.02]It's called The Invisible Hand.
[00:57.38]It's a game where you sell, buy, and trade stocks.
[01:01.16]Fake stocks.
[01:02.48]Nothing that you hear from now going forward is financial advice.
[01:09.09]Nothing you hear me say until the stream ends is me telling you what to buy, what to sell.
[01:15.87]Not at all.
[01:17.51]This is not financial advice.
[01:20.88]None of it.
[01:21.48]This is all made up bullshit.
[01:24.84]Okay, here we go.
[01:27.86]Remember, we're 12.
[01:30.89]Okay, I told you this would happen.
[01:34.23]Wait, I'm already going?
[01:35.63]Don't even think about trying to bail.
[01:36.73]It's too late.
[01:37.33]Shortage of water.
[01:38.19]Emergency taxation to save the unidollar.
[01:40.22]What?
[01:41.60]We're gonna ride this one out.
[01:42.56]Don't worry about it.
[01:43.66]Should I buy?
[01:45.86]Why aren't you saying anything?
[01:46.64]Why are people screaming in the background?
[01:48.90]Shortage of manpower.
[01:51.84]Wait, what?
[01:52.52]Oil, gas, down.
[01:53.56]Logging is up.
[01:54.28]Don't pay attention to them.
[01:55.12]Pay attention to me.
[01:55.74]This is what you paid me for.
[01:56.58]Have you dumped that mining position?
[01:57.88]Don't do it.
[01:59.12]Liquidate everything.
[02:02.74]Wait, don't do it.
[02:03.44]Everybody shut the fuck up.
[02:04.30]I'm on the phone.
[02:05.10]Don't panic.
[02:05.65]Just a lot of things happening at once.
[02:07.53]Wait, it's turning around.
[02:08.19]I think it's turning around.
[02:08.99]Hello?
[02:12.71]Is your terminal busted?
[02:13.87]Ours is spewing a ton of crazy shit, but I have no idea if any of it's real.
[02:17.61]Buy?
[02:17.93]What am I buying?
[02:19.47]Green grocers.
[02:20.35]Okay, I'm gonna buy short for- I don't even know what I'm looking at!
[02:23.17]Daily ch- Liquidate everything now.
[02:26.89]Buy back 100%.
[02:27.37]Anyways, call me back if you hear anything from it.
[02:30.14]Who has steel?
[02:32.10]Oh no, I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna answer the phone call from the Bogdanoff.
[02:34.50]So you out of your fucking mind?
[02:36.54]Okay, buy back everything.
[02:39.87]The system is down.
[02:41.91]Materials, materials, materials.
[02:45.62]Uh, lobby Congress?
[02:46.98]I don't, what do I have?
[02:47.92]This is like just the intro, right?
[02:50.60]Jake, let me ask him.
[02:51.30]Do you trust me?
[02:52.20]Is everyone kind of counting dead?
[02:53.38]Did a bomb go off?
[02:54.70]I can't hear anything.
[02:56.20]Oh, okay.
[02:59.68]Oh, he bought?
[03:01.56]Downbeat.
[03:12.11]There he is.
[03:14.25]Okay, coffee $4.90.
[03:19.01]As the screen behind me implies, welcome to Ferrios.
[03:22.25]You may have been surprised to hear from us following the recent crash, but I'm pleased to confidently disclose that the bailout has come through.
[03:29.88]Needless to say, everybody involved in that crisis has been held suitably responsible.
[03:33.70]They now work for our inferior competitors.
[03:37.46]Because of this, we have an entry-level analyst position available.
[03:41.80]We've also had some complaints in the past, so this is now a paid internship.
[03:46.72]Ordinarily, we wouldn't consider someone without a traditional finance background, but you were recommended by an employee we consider trustworthy.
[03:54.05]And they consider you trustworthy.
[03:56.65]As you know, trust is risk.
[03:57.97]Please act accordingly.
[04:00.31]Before we proceed, the Trade and Investment Commission requires Ferrios to subject all potential hires to a questionnaire.
[04:06.14]Common sense implies that you know what the correct answers to these questions are.
[04:10.66]Please input them as quickly as possible so we can move past this.
[04:14.62]I doubt, with all sincerity, that anybody who takes longer than a few minutes to complete this test is in any way suited to employment at this firm.
[04:22.38]Okay.
[04:23.30]I know a lot about stocks.
[04:24.96]I know about fucking selling.
[04:26.24]I know about buying.
[04:27.26]I know about calls.
[04:28.35]I know about puts.
[04:29.37]I know about shorts.
[04:30.43]I know about longs.
[04:31.43]I could get every one of these questions right.
[04:37.56]I know what the 10-year yield is.
[04:39.57]You don't.
[04:41.05]I do.
[04:41.49]Nobody else does but me.
[04:43.65]Additionally, our public relations team has suggested that we voluntarily submit to an enhanced pass score of 100% out of 80.
[04:49.37]More ethical.
[04:51.01]We've agreed on your behalf.
[04:54.14]Timer will begin as soon as you press the begin test button.
[04:57.90]Okay, here we go.
[04:59.22]What is a covered call?
[05:01.04]Well...
[05:02.53]Question one, you are approached by a high net worth individual with a substantial capital gain who explicitly states the desire to exempt it from all taxation in all jurisdictions.
[05:12.04]Do you open the account and assure the client that your firm will be able to complete this request?
[05:18.72]Open the account, but inform the client that your firm will not be able to exempt them from taxation unless they are willing to pay specialized fees directly to the firm and you.
[05:28.93]Reject the account and report the stated intent of the client to the Trade and Investment Commission.
[05:37.40]So, he wants me to hide taxes?
[05:42.17]Capital gains taxes.
[05:47.99]Well, how many fees?
[05:51.09]How would we even do this, by the way?
[05:52.91]To drop this person's capital gains, we'd have to lose a bunch of money.
[05:57.74]If this person had a substantial capital gain for the year, we'd have to lose a substantial amount of their fucking money.
[06:05.60]I mean, if that's what they want, I mean, you're gonna pay a fee to me for me to, like, just buy a bunch of bullshit and lose it?
[06:10.78]That's what you want?
[06:16.83]I failed the test.
[06:23.75]You fucking idiot.
[06:29.94]First question.
[06:32.34]Hey, take this regulatory test.
[06:35.18]Do you want to do anything illegal?
[06:38.91]Yes.
[06:39.63]Okay, fucking leave.
[06:40.77]Alright, reject the account.
[06:42.05]Reject the account.
[06:44.81]colleague invites you to join an insider trading scheme involving a computer network in which investment profiles professionals illegally exchange privileged information do you accept the invitation to make full use of the network to personally enrich yourself and your firm accept the invitation as a gesture of goodwill but do not make use of the network yourself or reject the invitation and immediately inform the trade investment commission of this network
[07:10.95]No, I'm going to get fucking fired.
[07:13.34]No, this is a question.
[07:15.10]This is an ethics question.
[07:17.74]A rumor about something like this ghost network started years ago.
[07:20.66]TIC, probably, whatever.
[07:22.56]You are asked to invest on behalf of your firm in an offshore company with self-evident connections to organized crime, rogue states, and are individuals banned from securities trading.
[07:32.25]Hey, do you... No, this would reject everyone.
[07:34.97]We're going to reject.
[07:40.27]And we just hit the ones that are already selected.
[07:41.93]Yeah, okay.
[07:46.65]The Trade and Investment Commission.
[07:47.81]Yeah, I know.
[07:48.49]But, like, it's fun to read.
[07:49.75]Yeah, alright.

[08:36.10]Await formal obligation for the trade commission.
[08:40.96]Don't take that money.
[08:43.80]If suggested discrimination on the basis of race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, or another marriage, you're not supposed to take the illegal trading activity.
[08:51.14]I passed it.
[08:54.86]M&M is scared to rap battle.
[09:00.49]Okay.
[09:01.53]Your company has submitted to the Trade and Investment Commission that they have a values-based culture focused on the following.
[09:06.67]Accountability, customer focus, diversity.
[09:09.42]How does this culture align with your deeply held personal beliefs and your standard historical workplace practices?
[09:13.96]Please answer in 100 words or less.
[09:15.44]Is that good enough?
[09:35.97]That's a Redditor joke.
[09:43.14]You guys are pretty split on that one.
[09:44.90]You guys are pretty split on that one.
[09:47.20]Your company has submitted to the Trade Commission their ideal employee supports innovation with a salary in the top 1% of earners.
[09:54.72]What amount of cash would you pledge to a crowdfunding campaign?
[10:05.08]Hmm.
[10:12.00]Okay, so wait.
[10:12.60]If I had... I don't know.
[10:16.46]$100,000?
[10:16.48]$100,000?
[10:16.50]It looks like a campaign.
[10:21.76]Hmm.
[10:22.04]Well...
[10:42.43]I would not be able to give like 100,000 plus dollars to somebody like in cash.
[10:46.60]They would be walking around.
[10:47.40]They would be like a target.
[10:48.24]I'm not going to do that.
[11:00.94]Zero.
[11:01.40]Get out of here.
[11:01.98]Maybe 500?
[11:09.23]$500 and then, like, I don't know, be like, hey, how much would it take for you to, like, be in a hotel for, like, three weeks?
[11:16.58]Leave your $500 cash and then I put you up in a hotel for, like, a month.
[11:21.60]Right?
[11:21.84]Like... Yeah, right?
[11:31.78]What do you mean, yeah, right?
[11:39.02]Your company, Ferris, has submitted to the trading commission that their ideal employee believes in integrity.
[11:42.44]What's your primary motivation for wanting to help people through working in the financial services industry?
[11:47.77]Um... I dunno.
[11:56.13]Is my motivation?
[12:28.58]That's probably what I would want.
[12:29.92]That's pretty accurate.
[12:34.06]You're playing a stock market simulation video game entitled The Invisible Hand with a range of difficulty options.
[12:38.75]What mode of difficulty would you prefer?
[12:40.49]I want to play the game with story featuring the inability to be fired.
[12:46.43]Well, regular.
[12:48.11]The way that they wanted it to be played.
[12:55.08]Congratulations.
[12:55.60]Your ability to correctly answer these questions with little hesitation implies your clear understanding of their value.
[12:59.80]If you'll excuse me, I have another meeting.
[13:03.52]This exam is the only phase of our recruitment process in which a company supervisor is legally required.
[13:07.81]The remainder of our procedure involves several days of take-home work that you'll need to complete within 72 hours.
[13:14.91]I will email it to you shortly.
[13:17.40]Unfortunately, we're not able to offer compensation for this take-home work, as we're already making a substantial investment by reviewing your submission of it.
[13:24.44]As someone with a newly renewed sense of ethics, I'm sure you can agree that anything else would be deeply unfair to us.
[13:30.63]If selected for the position, you will receive an offer of employment in writing.
[13:34.11]Barrios will only communicate with successful applicants.
[13:37.77]It was so wonderful to meet with you today.
[13:39.75]I really enjoyed it.
[13:40.37]Mm-hmm.
[13:44.23]Do not contact me with inquiries regarding the status of your application.
[13:48.49]Goodbye.
[13:50.35]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[13:52.77]Only buy, never sell.
[13:55.08]Is that what you want me to do?
[14:04.42]Use your keyboard to move around, okay?
[14:11.91]You guys can't even hear anything.
[14:21.40]That's better.
[14:24.04]Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[14:28.06]Meet in main lobby.
[14:28.92]Attendance is mandatory.
[14:30.44]Did I get the job?
[14:32.28]Nice to meet you.
[14:32.68]I'm Morgan Lee.
[14:34.36]Seems like only one of us is going to end up with this job.
[14:37.07]I tried to look you up on business link and a few other alumni networks, but I couldn't find anything.
[14:41.53]That means you're either a big problem or no problem at all.
[14:43.85]Interesting.
[14:44.23]Okay.
[14:49.57]Oh, look at all those stock tickers.
[14:50.95]Plastics are down.
[14:55.20]What happened?
[14:55.98]Can we get down?
[15:00.32]There's a fire in the building.
[15:13.74]10 o'clock.
[15:14.10]Meet in the main lobby.
[15:15.06]All right.
[15:20.86]What's that?
[15:23.28]Attack on Titan.
[15:28.57]I love that city.
[15:29.57]It's just like an image.
[15:31.05]I love it.
[15:34.37]Do I have my own computer?
[15:35.33]What are you doing?
[15:35.88]What?
[15:37.06]It's 10 a.m.
[15:37.72]Join us.
[15:38.16]Oh, shit.
[15:38.56]Sorry.
[15:39.58]Well, I've been here.
[15:42.36]Good morning to both of you.
[15:43.00]Welcome to Furious and your first day as a probationary analyst.
[15:46.87]I'm looking for the right person to fill this role.
[15:48.33]One of you is the wrong person.
[15:50.11]If either of you figured it out ahead of schedule, fear free to let me know.
[15:53.73]Otherwise, we'll let the results speak for themselves.
[15:56.07]Follow me.
[15:57.89]This is intimidating.
[16:09.76]Even resources put the personal garbage you sent over into these boxes.
[16:13.08]Like if I'm like, if I like buy like a stock in my bed on my phone, you know what I mean?
[16:20.19]And I just lose money on it.
[16:23.29]I don't care.
[16:23.73]Okay, whatever.
[16:24.87]But like if I have people to look off my shoulder and see what I'm doing.
[16:30.30]So we can grab, rotate, and throw.
[16:34.34]If it was up to me, none of you would be allowed to have this kind of clutter on your desk in the first place.
[16:37.58]Somebody must have threatened a lawsuit.
[16:40.63]But organize at least.
[16:41.45]This is a place of business.
[16:46.03]Does it really strike you as an appropriate time to go rifling through your pathetic box of imaginary memories?
[16:53.25]I think I just got in trouble for doing that.
[16:55.01]Nobody answered that phone.
[17:02.25]Because a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?
[17:05.61]Alright, somebody pick up that phone.
[17:06.79]I fucking hate it.
[17:07.39]It's freaking me out.
[17:11.64]Where's my desk?
[17:12.54]Wait, is this my desk?
[17:13.36]I said I don't have to start working?
[17:15.40]Oh, it's not that phone.
[17:16.24]Wrong phone.
[17:16.70]Okay, green grocers is up.
[17:18.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17:18.80]Hello?
[17:21.10]Hey, how's your first day going, pal?
[17:25.21]Don't pitch to me if Corbin scares the shit out of you.
[17:27.11]You want it in?
[17:27.69]I got you in.
[17:29.33]Who did they put you up against for your probation?
[17:31.05]Morgan Lee?
[17:31.81]Fuck.
[17:32.47]I was worried they would do that.
[17:34.84]I'm not going to lie to you.
[17:35.98]You got basically no chance of beating her.
[17:37.62]She went to all the right schools, took all the right classes.
[17:40.10]Unfortunately, she's too squeaky clean to know all the right people like me.
[17:45.55]Where did this music come from?
[17:47.97]This is just the Undertale bar music.
[17:51.71]I also don't appreciate them pissing on my recommendation by setting you up to get fucked like this.
[17:56.23]I want to let you in on something.
[17:58.43]I have my guy give you access to Geist.
[18:01.23]You should see it on there now.
[18:04.20]Alright, GeistNet is a closed network made up of information brokers and anonymous insiders.
[18:09.18]You don't know who they are, you don't need to know who they are, they get taken care of.
[18:13.85]You're going to see information on Geist that goes against what you see on trade feed, what you watch on in, what you hear from your friends and your family, everything basically.
[18:22.21]Just remember, what you see on Geist is the smart money.
[18:26.80]Not only is it the truth, but we know it is before anyone else does.
[18:31.12]This is porn music.
[18:33.06]There's nothing wrong with the information everybody gets on trade feed.
[18:36.10]And you'll need all of it as things pick up, but Geist will always be the ace up your sleeve.
[18:41.03]Follow it over the next few days, for example, and you should be able to take down Lee easily.
[18:47.19]Nobody will ever tell her about it, and she wouldn't use it even if they did.
[18:53.23]Worried about getting dirty looks at the Kombucha Enema Clinic.
[18:56.45]Too scared of the money police, whatever.
[18:58.29]Not our problem.
[19:01.04]Most people at Ferrios know about Geist, but only a few people at Ferrios know about Geist.
[19:05.90]Don't treat it like a topic of casual conversation, you'll be fine.
[19:08.60]Brought you here because you didn't buckle under pressure at the old place.
[19:11.68]Now you weren't directly involved, but you could have talked, you didn't.
[19:15.50]That said, if you don't want to be a part of this, you can walk away right now.
[19:18.91]The moment you buy dark roast coffee, when everybody else on that floor is selling it, that's the moment I'll know where you stand.
[19:28.04]Really.
[19:28.94]And from there, my friend, the sky's the limit.
[19:31.16]I'll see you tonight.
[19:31.84]Drinks are on me.
[19:32.50]Okay?
[19:36.79]Dark Roast Coffee secretly secures exclusivity contract with Balcador supplier.

[20:44.81]Alright, what time is it?
[20:45.45]What time is it?
[20:45.79]What do we got for time?
[20:46.37]16 o'clock.
[20:47.43]They're going to announce it.
[20:50.15]Wait, should I sell now and buy back in again?
[20:51.45]Alright, I'm going to sell.
[20:55.34]I'm going to liquidate everything and I'm going to buy back again when it drops.
[20:58.64]I still have like three hours for this to happen.
[21:04.28]Sell everything right now.
[21:05.02]Sell everything.
[21:07.14]Oh, wait, what?
[21:13.88]Oh, it shows everything.

[28:58.74]Quinn Miller.
[28:59.34]And yes, to get it out of the way, my grandparents did start the company that owns Ferrios.
[29:04.14]Please don't worry.
[29:04.72]I'm not old or rich or gross.
[29:06.92]I'm here to work as hard as you do, I promise.
[29:09.50]Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
[29:17.34]Dinner tonight.
[29:18.42]Wagyu beef.
[29:19.14]Buy beef.
[29:21.62]Eat runner.
[29:22.36]Your true priority food courier service.
[29:24.10]No bicycles.
[29:24.72]No buy food.
[29:25.42]Buy meat.
[29:26.40]I'm buying meat.
[29:26.91]Nobody else.
[29:27.53]I'm not telling anybody else that I'm buying food.
[29:29.33]I'm buying meat.
[29:35.32]I'm trying to trade.
[29:36.10]So you met Quinn, huh?
[29:37.90]Make sure you don't cross her.
[29:39.93]You can manage it, actually.
[29:40.83]Stay the hell away from her completely.
[29:43.01]She might be a receptionist or a concierge or whatever the fuck she calls herself, but she connects all the way to the top.
[29:47.30]I heard someone once made Quinn photocopy a stack of documents.
[29:51.46]Quinn went on stress leave for two weeks after, and the guy who made her do it went on leave, too.
[29:56.34]Permanently.
[29:56.78]Hey, you take care of you.
[29:59.55]I'll take care of me.
[30:01.74]Oh, by the way, I heard there's a bunch of fucking, like, dirty, rotten, like, cows and beef and shit.
[30:08.07]I would short meat.
[30:09.95]I would short beef the second I got on my terminal.
[30:11.99]I heard there's a bunch of problems with it.
[30:14.19]Idiot.
[30:19.21]Yeah, everybody's going vegan.
[30:21.01]A lot of my friends are going vegan, by the way.
[30:28.02]Didn't labor dispute at DRC poise to surface?
[30:31.38]There isn't dark roast coffee bounce back heart- Good morning!
[30:37.40]It's time you learned about short selling.
[30:38.90]I've unlocked the capability to do this in your terminal.
[30:42.08]I realize that you've only had a single day to get oriented around a simple transaction, but the firm is losing money every second that you aren't doing this.
[30:48.54]Enough is enough.
[30:50.00]Short selling is where we borrow shares of a stock at its current price with the belief that this price will decrease.
[30:56.71]If it does decrease, we profit off the difference between that initial price and the price it is at when we execute the buyback.
[31:04.95]Doing this will also give you cash on hand to buy other stocks that you think will increase in value, taking a long position on them.
[31:11.53]GME.
[31:12.96]That should be all you need to know.
[31:14.04]It seems as if Dark Rose Coffee will see a lot of movement today as well.
[31:17.40]So that may be an opportunity for you to short sell us and do a nice little payday.
[31:21.29]Maybe it'll give you an opportunity to short a stock at 140% of the shares that are available to short.
[31:29.04]More than exist, 40% more than exist total.
[31:31.10]Can we do that?
[31:36.42]Maybe I should do that.
[31:37.10]Be sure to make use of any information that you may have at your disposal.
[31:45.84]Short selling is the sale of a stock you do not own.
[31:48.42]You immediately get some cash, but you have to buy back the shares later.
[31:50.90]You should use it to bet on the fall of dark roast coffee and use the cash for new long orders.
[31:56.25]Alright, so coffee will drop at 14.
[31:58.83]We're going to short coffee right now.
[32:00.57]I'm going to wait though.
[32:02.30]Let's see.
[32:03.04]It's probably going to go a little higher.
[32:05.83]Leave me the fuck alone!
[32:06.87]I'm working!
[32:09.60]You should get all this personal shit off your desk.
[32:11.24]It makes you look like an asshole.
[32:13.22]Hey, you know what makes you look like an asshole?
[32:15.36]Coming over and telling me my stuff on my desk looks stupid.
[32:18.68]Get out of here.
[32:20.85]Also, I see that Corbin gave you access to shorting.
[32:23.16]If you somehow manage to make some cash from shorting, DRC, wink wink, you should really consider buying Starnux and going long on it.
[32:30.76]What the fuck do you know?
[32:32.26]After coffee crashes, Starnux is only going to rise over time in response.
[32:36.25]Investing in Starnux will pay off, I guarantee it.
[32:39.65]I'm long on Starnux myself.
[32:41.29]Obviously, I wouldn't give you advice if it wasn't good for me too.
[32:43.99]Show me your portfolio right now.
[32:47.13]Show me your portfolio right now that you have already taken a position in Starnux right now and I'll do it.
[32:53.35]I got tickets to that thing tonight if you're good to chip in on bottle service afterwards.
[32:56.51]Later, trader.
[32:57.07]Okay.
[33:00.21]Beverages supply chain include coffee, so beverages will surge as coffee drops.
[33:05.31]Fire Starnux.
[33:07.01]Starnux sells beverages so it will surge with them.
[33:09.47]So go along on Starnux.
[33:11.83]Oh, hold on.
[33:12.27]Wait a minute.
[33:16.64]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[33:17.98]I gotta make a decision here.
[33:20.72]Check out the glossary for more information.
[33:23.32]I know, I know, I know what's going on.
[33:24.25]Alright, we're gonna do short position on coffee.
[33:29.47]For 100,000 shares.
[33:30.87]We're gonna go back to coffee.
[33:34.01]We're gonna go to beverages.
[33:36.19]Starnux.
[33:38.83]Starnux is a little high right now, though.
[33:40.78]Long.
[33:41.08]250,000 long.
[33:42.42]Long.
[33:51.78]This is coming down.
[33:53.75]Don't buy.
[33:54.07]I'm not going to buy it.
[33:54.77]That'd be stupid.
[33:59.03]I'm just going off the dispute that's going to happen.
[34:00.69]Coffee's going to drop around 14.
[34:09.26]Short the hell out of it.
[34:09.94]I'm going to get blown up.
[34:19.10]I'm gonna get blown up.
[34:20.24]I'm gonna get blown up.
[34:23.67]Okay, it's going down.
[34:26.87]Here comes the big announcement.
[34:34.36]I'm short.
[34:34.90]Mine is 172,000.
[34:35.18]Again.
[34:46.86]I have $357,000.
[34:48.02]Buy Starnux now.
[34:51.52]No, I'm not buying Starnux.
[34:54.87]Wait, should I buy Starnux?
[34:58.97]I'm gonna go long.
[35:00.77]Not that big of a position.
[35:01.77]$10,000.
[35:03.79]I'm long on Starnux.

[35:23.18]Shit's tanking.

[35:28.66]Alright.
[35:28.82]Here we go.
[35:31.16]Buy them back in.
[35:32.04]Not yet.
[35:34.82]Not yet.

[35:37.31]It's going to drop even more.
[35:42.17]It's coming down.

[38:17.61]During your end day of value, notice that it includes a public opinion metric.
[38:24.11]If you're doing your job properly, this shouldn't be something you'll have to worry about.
[38:26.92]If you start going overboard with the use of information that you obviously gain through illicit means, however, the media might start to take notice.
[38:34.42]Eventually, if enough op-eds get written, the Trade and Investment Commission will be forced to make a show of launching an investigation that can end with you in court.
[38:41.74]Unless I tell you otherwise, don't think a second that the company's gonna pay out for any fines or legal fees.
[38:47.50]Agreed, your problem.
[38:49.44]Bye.
[38:51.46]Did I get- did I sell it?

[40:15.72]Kill or be killed.
[40:24.05]Alright, first of all, I need to do something very quickly here.
[40:32.05]This has to change.
[40:33.81]Looking for grandma's antiques.
[40:35.09]It doesn't make any sense right now.
[40:40.74]Um...
[40:45.39]It does not.
[40:46.01]Uh, getting liquidated.
[40:54.94]Yeah.
[40:55.10]How about probably, probably getting liquidated.
[40:58.98]I think that's a good title.
[41:03.58]Here we go.
[41:07.49]Sorry if this is none of my business, but you look a little stressed out.
[41:09.65]I'm sure you've been introduced to the coffee situation, but have you tried the tea yet?
[41:13.36]It has the opposite effect.
[41:16.30]When I drink it, it feels like the whole world slows down.
[41:18.08]Focusing on small details becomes easier, and I stop worrying that things are constantly passing by.
[41:22.22]So coffee speeds up time, tea slows down time.
[41:26.74]Okay.
[41:37.50]Where's my new chair?
[41:38.14]I installed a strong coffee last night.
[41:45.30]Guys who loaded into the machines were practically wearing hazmat suits.
[41:53.99]I'm gonna clean up my desk a little.
[41:56.37]Oh fuck, hold on.
[41:59.13]Alright, what we got?
[41:59.67]Sit down!
[42:07.48]Okay, what we got?
[42:09.05]Greengrocer's revitalized destitute cities.
[42:12.57]Greengrocer's stock is headed to...
[42:18.57]Let me guess, you sat down at your desk and went straight to Geisnet, only to find it replaced by an extremely boring cable news network.
[42:26.03]It sucks, but sometimes journalism gets in the way of worthwhile information.
[42:29.67]When the insiders don't have anything interesting for us, we have to get by like everyone else.
[42:34.47]You best to read between the lines, though.
[42:36.09]You can still make a few bucks.
[42:37.47]At the very least, IN can clue you in on what suckers are paying attention to.
[42:43.70]At that point, sometimes all you have to do is be more cynical than they are.
[42:49.20]Later.
[42:49.46]Uh... Green Grocer's stock is headed upward after the company announced plans to open hundreds of new stores in cities devastated by the closure of auto factories.
[43:00.09]Company spokesman confirmed that all the cities chosen are expected to see increased interest from high-tech software firms looking to expand their office footprint.
[43:14.12]Great feed shows short-lived bits of information about what's going on in the market.
[43:18.09]They're not equally all accurate.
[43:20.17]The number of likes is what you should focus on.
[43:22.49]Okay.
[43:25.41]Easing of tariffs should increase the value of green grocers in the near future.
[43:28.55]Follow.
[43:29.07]Oh, okay.
[43:33.12]I gotta get these blinking things off screen.
[43:36.24]Yeah, long, short, materials, product.
[43:38.16]Okay, yeah, I know what that is.
[43:39.64]All right, let's go.
[43:43.22]Alright, so green grocers.
[43:48.39]Easing of terrorists for green grocers.
[43:49.85]Alright, hold on a minute.
[43:52.13]Aquafirma announces new brand.
[43:54.35]Aquafirma has a new brand.
[43:56.30]Go long.
[43:56.64]100,000.
[43:56.66]Got it in perfect timing.
[44:01.50]Alright.
[44:06.30]We're going to get out of four.
[44:11.68]Or... Alright, what about, um... Abundant source of water discovered threatening price decline on water.
[44:19.06]Nah, I'm not paying... I don't have to... I can only pay attention to one thing at a time.
[44:21.09]Alright, get out now.
[44:22.83]Alright, that's good.
[44:26.35]Good.
[44:26.65]Alright.
[44:27.73]Green grocers.
[44:28.77]Should we short green grocers?
[44:34.43]I think I'm going to put a short on green grocers.
[44:36.34]This is going up too high.
[44:42.27]All in on the short and green rushers.
[44:43.41]Let's go.
[44:44.87]We're getting out of 4.5.
[44:47.18]Oh.
[44:47.68]It's alright.
[44:48.22]It's coming back.
[44:49.30]Oh no.
[44:50.16]Oh no.
[44:50.70]That's not good.
[44:55.06]Hit the T. Hold on.
[44:58.19]Oh.
[44:58.53]Oh no.
[45:00.33]Oh no.
[45:02.03]Why did I do that?
[45:03.15]Guys, you just have to hold it for a second.
[45:05.07]Just hold it.
[45:05.57]It's coming back down.
[45:11.46]It's coming back down.
[45:12.36]Okay?

[45:33.75]It's gonna pop up.
[45:38.49]Green Grocers is gonna hit a peak.
[45:39.57]It's gonna come down.
[45:43.28]Unexpected demand for produce.
[45:44.34]That was, uh, produce, produce, produce, stock, stock, stock, produce.
[45:51.82]New regulations on holding food stuff in this bag.
[45:55.50]God damn it, go down.
[45:57.06]Green Grocers, what the fuck?
[46:00.28]Oh my god, I've lost so much money on Green Grocers so far.

[50:12.91]I'm thinking of replacing Chef Burgundy if he doesn't get his act together.
[50:16.91]You expect a gourmet chef to get fussy when you tell them to do basically anything, but it's supposed to be in good fun.
[50:21.03]When he started, he was very yuric about it.
[50:24.26]He was charming.
[50:27.26]It's different.
[50:27.64]He's depressed or something.
[50:28.46]Can you believe that?
[50:29.12]A guy who yells at people about foie gras for a living?
[50:32.04]It's bad energy.
[50:33.52]Whatever.
[50:38.70]Drinks the tea.
[50:41.68]Alright, I'm gonna drink tea.
[50:43.24]Tea strength.

[51:19.69]What's my position?
[51:20.35]What the fuck is this position that's open?
[51:22.27]What's that?
[51:22.73]What's going on?
[51:23.27]What?
[51:24.79]Why do I have an open long position in Starbucks?

[52:13.63]What's the other- what's the big chart look like?
[52:15.95]The daily chart?
[52:16.77]Nah, this looks like it could go up.
[52:18.27]It's gonna go up.
[52:20.27]Foodstuffs.
[52:21.05]Green grocers.
[52:23.53]Coffee's scheduled to go up.
[52:25.88]Why am I talking like it's in slow motion?
[52:37.06]Why is it going down?
[52:43.00]Weed stalks.
[52:45.10]I can't believe I kept that position open from yesterday.
[52:49.42]Uno Eats is still going down.
[52:50.44]Alright, come on.
[52:51.10]Give me something new here that I can react to immediately.

[53:39.43]This is skyrocketing.
[53:40.57]How am I losing money?
[53:41.53]Minus 800?
[53:42.13]What the fuck?
[53:51.32]You bought at the top?
[53:52.16]No, I didn't.
[53:52.86]The news just came out.
[53:53.74]Water's going down.
[53:55.10]Oh, shit.

[54:27.87]What the hell?
[54:38.22]Oh my god.
[54:39.04]Beverages.
[54:42.96]Coffee.
[54:43.42]Look, unexpected demand for coffee chokes existing supply.
[54:45.78]This shit is tanking.
[54:49.89]Beverages aren't coffee.
[54:51.11]What?
[54:51.31]How does that make any sense?
[54:55.29]How long does the tea work for?
[55:05.88]Green grocers going down.
[55:08.62]I'm going to hold the Starbucks position because I think it's going to explode tomorrow.
[55:14.70]Minus $100,000.
[55:15.96]Come on.

[56:43.97]Keep going.
[56:45.15]More people are gonna start talking about the CEO of Uno Eats.
[56:57.26]Only 1.4.
[56:57.58]Is it gonna bounce?
[56:59.60]Don't bounce.
[57:01.30]Back under 9.
[57:01.86]Come on.

[58:05.00]How is that not a beverage?
[58:09.78]Water is a beverage.
[58:16.65]Zero likes?
[58:17.83]What the fuck?
[58:22.87]Oh my god, why?
[58:24.49]There we go.
[58:26.31]Alright, it's going up.

[59:32.61]Look at it.
[59:32.97]Now it's going crazy.
[59:45.64]Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[59:47.36]Don't do that.
[59:50.06]I'm going back and I'm drinking coffee.
[59:52.76]What a disaster.
[59:53.50]I should have never bought into Electrogear Emporium.
[60:02.15]Everyone buys that shit online now.
[60:09.27]Drink enough coffee so the stock goes up.
[60:16.86]Just buy the dip.
[60:18.90]You know?
[60:19.70]It's not a bad idea.
[60:29.24]It's not a bad idea.
[60:35.96]All in.
[60:44.43]All in on Starbucks.
[60:45.47]I keep saying that's not a real company.
[60:49.37]Here it comes.

[61:00.67]Look at where this was.
[61:01.58]Jesus.
[61:04.56]That's not good.
[61:05.34]That's really bad.
[61:06.24]The dip is dipping.
[61:08.30]I need to make money on coffee.
[61:11.06]Come on.
[61:13.64]Starnux.
[61:14.84]Introduces new...
[61:17.20]Spiced pumpkin frappuccino.
[61:27.73]Oh, go down.
[61:31.57]Oh my god.
[61:32.55]I thought computation predicts green growth.
[61:34.55]What do you mean computation?
[61:36.40]Coffee's going up.
[61:39.02]Food stuff's going down.
[61:39.88]Coffee going up.
[61:42.04]Is Starbucks probably going to work?
[61:43.90]Price of beverages is rising.
[61:45.24]Starbucks is a beverage, right?
[61:50.26]Get out of this.
[61:50.66]Get out of this.
[61:54.49]All of you naysayers.
[61:56.15]All of you naysayers.
[61:57.57]This is going to be a... Oh my god.
[62:00.05]And you told me I was fucking wrong?
[62:02.57]This is a $100,000 plus trade.
[62:09.68]I'm going to hold it for another minute.
[62:16.77]Seventy-six thousand.
[62:19.73]Can I get out now?
[62:20.25]Go hold it.
[62:24.86]No, take the profit.
[62:25.76]I'm out.
[62:28.28]Seventy-five thousand dollars.
[62:30.02]Everybody just, you call me out.
[62:31.94]It's fine.
[62:34.66]I'll get some more coffee.
[62:43.52]What happened to you?
[62:45.32]Did you short coffee?
[62:47.03]Dumb.
[63:01.99]I think this is back to normal now.
[63:03.05]What do we got?
[63:09.13]That was a good trading day.
[63:10.01]I made 100 grand.
[63:10.43]Are you kidding me?
[63:17.72]We got out at the perfect opportunity right at the top.
[63:23.54]Coffee again going up.
[63:25.02]I'm done for the day.
[63:26.00]I'm done for the trading day.
[63:26.88]Maybe one more trade to take it in tomorrow.
[63:29.75]What's beating up right now?
[63:33.17]Uno Eats is really just beat up.
[63:34.73]We're going long on Uno Eats.
[63:36.13]And I'm going 250 fucking thousand shares.
[63:40.27]Uno Eats.
[63:40.91]Look at this.
[63:42.85]It's been absolutely decimated.
[63:44.29]There's no reason for that.
[63:46.13]CEO leaked something, whatever it was.
[63:52.76]Oh, and that was a stupid idea, but apparently Jeremy knows how to trade fucking stocks and everybody here doesn't understand it.
[63:57.76]That's fine.
[63:58.10]Go green with Uno Eats.
[64:03.49]Oh, well, what's that?
[64:04.37]Excuse me.
[64:08.64]The CEO, uh, like, the CEO, like, fucking leaked, like, a nude picture of himself or something.
[64:12.96]That has nothing to do with the company.
[64:14.07]Get up.
[64:18.45]I'm up.
[64:25.81]We got out a little early, but I want to secure that profit, because something could happen tomorrow.
[64:29.16]There we go.
[64:29.58]Secured.
[64:33.58]That was a big day.
[64:40.48]Mustache made him... Wait, I got fired?
[64:43.16]Oh no, they got fired.
[64:45.65]New rival promoted.
[64:46.71]I got promoted.
[64:50.87]Own is $53,000.
[64:51.55]$86,000 today.
[64:53.15]This game's fun.
[64:56.70]I like this game.
[65:00.00]Perios makes a point of investing in employees who show potential.
[65:03.12]The additional truth is that we don't want to be associated with people who live in squalor.
[65:09.40]you started investing in real estate I'm asking rhetorically of course I know you haven't but I've got good news the firm retains a number of condominiums in the city for analysts in your exact position you'll see that your terminal now has access to a personal real estate service start by claiming the condo we've given you which is sitting in the market and eventually you might get the chance to grow into a bigger place of your own screw up and you'll be right back where you started wherever that was bye first condo is financed by ferrios all right
[65:41.70]You got three decoration slots in your condo.
[65:44.40]Here's your property.
[65:47.20]Market value, 28,000.
[65:48.10]You can store luxury items in your properties.
[65:52.26]It will increase their market value when leasing or selling them.
[65:57.14]When decoration is up to standard, you should put this property on lease for sweet landlord income.
[66:04.19]Alright, how about a, um... How about a designer chair?
[66:09.33]Bear statue?
[66:12.27]An analyst certificate.
[66:16.81]A condo.
[66:18.66]Do I lease it?
[66:21.82]Do I make money from this?
[66:25.78]Sell condo.
[66:26.48]Easy money.
[66:27.04]Well, not yet.
[66:29.98]He's a landlord.
[66:30.72]Get him.
[66:32.00]Well, I want to make my price fair.
[66:36.34]This is where I live.
[66:37.26]Oh, I don't need to lease it.
[66:38.03]Look at the money I got in my bank account.
[66:39.35]I'm living here.
[66:39.89]I'll buy a car.
[66:41.19]Can I buy a car?
[66:42.69]Can I buy another condo?
[66:50.14]Should I buy two condos?
[66:51.02]I have two condos.
[66:55.16]Why did I do that?
[67:03.67]I just have two condos.
[67:04.95]Alright, well then I'll rent this one.
[67:07.13]Right?
[67:07.29]Is that how this works?
[67:11.11]Lease the second one.
[67:15.61]Okay.
[67:16.60]Is everybody in another condo?
[67:23.18]Lease this condo?
[67:24.12]How many condos should I have?
[67:27.90]Alright, no more condos.
[67:29.74]Stop.
[67:29.96]What the fuck?
[67:30.62]I'm leasing the condo.
[67:32.28]Look, I made $100,000 yesterday.
[67:37.04]On Starnux.
[67:43.00]Wait.
[67:44.02]Buy furniture.
[67:45.88]$40,000?
[67:46.06]Okay, nice.
[67:51.20]Okay, the gold toilet's going in there.
[67:52.84]That's worth a lot of money.
[67:58.67]Is that all the gold toilet for 20,000?
[68:00.91]Holy shit.
[68:06.21]10,000 for this bust?
[68:10.59]I'll just... No, why did I do that?
[68:13.35]Oops.
[68:14.45]It's alright.
[68:15.41]Right under the condo?
[68:20.92]I can't be serious about this.
[68:21.72]My performance has been exceptional.
[68:24.87]Sorry, Mrs. Lee, but the probationary terms are clearly specified.
[68:27.85]There's no room at Furious for second best.
[68:29.65]This is an issue of principle.
[68:32.77]My trades were flawless and my analysis of trade feed was perfect.
[68:35.81]It was not.
[68:37.91]You took losses at several points.
[68:40.65]And I always made up for them.
[68:41.69]The only way you could have possibly come out ahead of me is if you... I saw it happening, but I figured that you would.
[68:47.77]I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
[68:50.41]I didn't even use insider information.
[68:52.81]I was just a moron.
[68:56.70]I saw the number low, and I put all of my money into it, and the number went up, and I sold.
[69:03.88]I didn't do anything.
[69:05.02]I was just an idiot.
[69:07.40]Thank you for your time.
[69:08.10]I would please provide you with a reference.
[69:11.34]You think I don't know what's going on here?
[69:12.66]You would have to be blind.
[69:14.38]You're barely even trying to hide it.
[69:15.54]This is Lee.
[69:18.56]Your family is very well respected.
[69:19.79]Please don't compel me to have security escort you from the building, or there to be any kind of public unpleasantness.
[69:26.21]Public unpleasantness?
[69:27.67]Does talking like that make you feel like you come from somewhere?
[69:30.67]You couldn't keep me in this shithole at gunpoint.
[69:33.61]Bye, Mrs. Lee.
[69:34.77]Fuck you.
[69:43.01]I can't say it.
[69:44.31]She didn't see shit, by the way.
[69:46.49]Sorry about that.
[69:47.23]I trade better than I talk.
[69:48.17]I worry about Mrs. Lee.
[69:51.60]I'm sure she'll find another firm that will take her.
[69:53.38]And if not, the world's always looking for wealthy tourists.
[69:57.84]Congratulations again.
[69:58.68]Keep your eye on the ball.
[70:00.43]Alright.
[70:01.81]Alright.
[70:05.59]Alright.
[70:06.39]I got money.
[70:11.75]I got money.
[70:12.27]I'm good.
[70:13.65]I got it.
[70:13.99]What are you doing?
[70:17.75]Holy shit.
[70:21.43]This dude lost two million dollars today.
[70:30.50]1.8 million loss.
[70:35.06]I'll take my 60.
[70:35.90]I'll take my $78,000 gain and make my way.
[70:39.54]Oh, that's like such.
[70:40.22]I'm such a small fry.
[70:42.90]The person walked up from the desk and they didn't even turn their computer off with a $2 million loss.
[70:47.44]I'm sitting here celebrating with like $70,000 trade.
[70:48.88]Let's get a $10 million account.
[71:08.88]Small time.
[71:11.90]Quit streaming and day trade.
[71:13.15]You know that like 98% of day traders lose money or something?
[71:18.15]Whatever the statistic is.
[71:19.69]I don't think I want to do that.
[71:20.51]I don't think I would like to do that.
[71:24.29]I should probably read this.
[71:28.41]Hell, I'm already tired of the car I bought a week ago.
[71:30.43]Expensive taste never keeps up with easy boredom.
[71:33.85]That's a problem with everybody in this fucking business.
[71:37.19]You'll be happier after I get you tossed out of here, but I know you won't believe it until it happens.
[71:40.91]Until then, do your worst, kiddo.
[71:48.58]A lot of people are rooting for you to take out Clark.
[71:51.64]Let's face it, she's washed up.
[71:53.10]Has been.
[71:53.78]Maybe even never was.
[71:54.82]I'm sure she made a lot of money, but as somebody who comes from that world, I can tell you that she has no class.
[72:00.86]People like her don't belong here.
[72:02.06]Don't tell her I said this, but I'll be happy if she was sleeping in a pile of cardboard.
[72:05.75]Oh my god.
[72:06.89]So sick of her, I'm too cool for this world.
[72:10.03]Wouldn't it be better if we could let it all go attitude?
[72:13.31]Make their dream come true.
[72:14.25]You got this.
[72:20.65]Alright, I gotta get ready for the day.
[72:21.89]Following the demands of coffee plantation workers being met in Bocador, a second labor crisis has now sprung up in their oil industry.
[72:34.53]Northern Oil and Gas will rally after 16.
[72:39.20]Northern Oil and Gas.
[72:43.78]How much money do I got?
[72:45.00]I got $500,000 in cash.
[72:48.64]Northern oil and gas is going to rally at 16.
[72:52.28]I'm going to put all my money in this.
[72:57.71]Wait till it falls a little more.
[72:58.77]I'm looking for a good entry.
[73:02.59]Right there.
[73:03.01]Go.
[73:06.90]What?
[73:10.18]What's up, buddy?
[73:10.90]I take it you've seen the news about oil going down a little bit and the Geisnet post about it going up a whole lot.
[73:16.14]Well, today is going to be a wild one.
[73:17.58]We're going to fuck up both those expectations and make a killing doing it.
[73:22.00]Let me introduce you to our lobbyists.
[73:25.34]You can let them sweat the details, but we deploy lobbyists when we want to put pressure on a stock price to go in one direction or the other without buying or selling it.
[73:34.70]In this case, I want you to send them out to make oil prices go through the floor.
[73:39.62]No!
[73:40.10]No!
[73:40.82]Harper, I just bought it.
[73:42.36]Can we just wait?
[73:44.75]They'll fly to Bocador, yell at a few people, and make sure that not only does that government bailout for Northern never come through, but that a whole lot of bullshit gets kicked up as a result.
[73:54.46]The oil price won't just go down a little, it'll go down by a ton.
[73:59.36]And should let us beat up on anybody who expected anything else.
[74:02.94]Which is us, I just put $500,000 on the line.
[74:07.10]After you assign a lobbyist, short the hell out of anything related to oil and watch as it magically tanks.
[74:13.18]Wait, but hold on.
[74:15.01]Hold on.
[74:15.23]I need to drink tea.
[74:16.11]I gotta drink tea.
[74:16.57]I'll be right back.
[74:19.45]No, stop.
[74:20.95]You're not the first glorified trainee I've had to send home, and you won't be the last.
[74:24.37]Remember what I told you.
[74:26.29]You don't really... Just let me go do my drugs.
[74:28.71]I'll be right back.
[74:29.11]Thank you.
[74:41.11]Just a little bit of slowdown, just so I can have another second or two.
[74:43.28]See the news about the oil.
[74:44.18]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[74:47.52]Oh, shit.
[74:48.10]Okay.
[74:48.62]I gotta get out of this trade.
[74:49.76]Send lobbyists to lower the price of oil.
[74:52.48]Lower the price of the... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[74:54.38]Sending lobbyists to lower the price of oil will decrease the value of oil suppliers.
[74:58.71]Short northern oil and gas before you send in lobbyists.
[75:02.61]Um, okay.
[75:03.03]Stocks.
[75:03.67]Oil and gas.
[75:06.09]Um... Uh... Just get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[75:10.03]Short it.
[75:13.20]Okay.
[75:14.06]I'm gonna short oil and gas.
[75:17.49]And then I'm gonna send in the lobbyists.
[75:21.83]Where's- How do I do that?
[75:22.69]How do I do that?
[75:26.91]Oil.
[75:28.05]Use the lobby controls to send a lobbyist in- Okay.
[75:30.61]Send in lobbyists to make it go down.
[75:32.29]Sending lobbyists to lower the price of oil will also increase the value of the products that it is an ingredient in.
[75:37.36]Going long on plastics.
[75:38.78]Well, what the fuck?
[75:41.10]Long on plastic?
[75:45.87]All right.
[75:46.15]All right.
[75:46.47]All right.
[75:46.83]All right.
[75:47.11]All right.
[75:48.43]What do we got?
[75:49.47]Where?
[75:50.45]How much money do we have?
[75:55.43]Send in more lobbyists.
[75:57.37]Make plastic go up.
[75:58.29]What are we doing?
[76:04.29]I'm up.
[76:04.57]I'm up a little bit on these.
[76:06.51]Gas is going down.
[76:09.59]Send more lobbyists.
[76:14.92]More!
[76:15.94]More!
[76:16.22]Okay.
[76:30.68]That's a big trade so far.
[76:32.06]What happened?
[76:35.45]What happened?
[76:37.47]Why did it sell that?
[76:38.21]I didn't want to sell that.
[76:39.49]Where's my positions?
[76:40.27]Why did they close everything?
[76:42.64]Tortoise with oil?
[76:43.32]Hey!
[76:44.98]Why did you sell my shit?
[76:46.62]Nice job on sending out the lobbies to drive the oil market down.
[76:48.86]They told me they couldn't have done it without you.
[76:53.87]They're probably just sucking you off, but I guess you don't get- whatever.
[77:00.11]As expected, the sudden drop in value created chaos and instability, but then it shot right back up after.
[77:03.99]Textbook stuff.
[77:06.39]Your short positions would have been worthless, so I automatically sold them for you.
[77:10.81]You've gotten some bad press with the whole situation, but nothing PR can't handle.
[77:15.11]Speaking of the reactions of the pathetic losers, I forgot to tell you about the public opinion meter.
[77:20.86]If you look at your terminal, you'll see a speedometer-type thing.
[77:24.50]It gets tilted around by the tooth-bleached rectangle people at our PR agency based on how much bad shit happens in the world thanks to us.
[77:33.47]Okay?
[77:34.69]Pay attention to those, because if the things you do in the market pisses people off too much, bad things can happen.
[77:39.98]Friending hashtags, people crying on camera, persecution from trust-funded commie bloggers, etc.
[77:46.38]You might even end up in some kind of court, getting yelled at by elected officials, having to pay fines, hell, you might even have to apologize.
[77:54.76]Diversify who and what you shit on, though, and you should be fine.
[77:58.68]Don't fuck around.
[77:59.34]Okay.
[78:04.34]We got it.
[78:05.14]We still have some time on the trading day.
[78:06.68]I got $535,000 in cash.
[78:08.20]What's, uh, I don't know, what's, uh, I'm talking like a fucking trader here.
[78:14.28]What's beating up today?
[78:16.61]Aquafirma?
[78:18.77]Wouldn't it be interesting if we did a $500,000 fucking long on Aquafirma and sent in the lobbyists?
[78:29.60]What do you think about that?
[78:34.94]Price of water drops as production rises, but you send in lobbyists and all of a sudden here you are.
[78:43.32]I want this to be a huge trade.
[78:45.12]More.
[78:51.95]More.
[78:53.07]I want at least 70,000.
[78:53.93]Alright, don't get greedy.
[79:00.63]Close it.
[79:07.61]The boiler says buy dark roast coffee.
[79:10.03]I don't trust that person.
[79:13.75]Electronics are new, okay?
[79:15.43]Plastics, beverages, food stuff, electronics.
[79:20.46]LW lodging.
[79:21.44]This is wood.
[79:25.58]AK-24-7.
[79:27.38]Munitions.
[79:29.36]This is pretty low.
[79:30.14]Look at this.
[79:31.36]Look at how ugly this chart is.
[79:36.72]Go all in.
[79:44.51]And send in the lobbyists.
[79:50.09]I think that was doing it already.
[79:53.29]I think this is... LW lodging is down.
[79:58.28]Keep going.
[80:01.32]Oh, fuck.
[80:01.78]My public opinion meter.
[80:02.68]I can't do that.
[80:03.42]I gotta stop doing that, right?
[80:08.05]All right, we're going to get out of this trade.
[80:10.79]We're going to go to plastics.
[80:12.77]This is just daily information.
[80:15.13]Plastics, going up.
[80:15.91]$25,000 trade.
[80:17.27]How do I change my public opinion?
[80:28.50]Come on, I didn't put that much money in this.
[80:31.93]Water's down a lot.
[80:33.53]Water is down a lot, so you know what we do.
[80:37.66]We wait for this to bottom out.
[80:39.64]Alright.
[80:39.88]This is a good trade.
[80:44.14]Let this bottom out and then I'm going to buy 500,000.
[80:47.58]Bottom out.
[80:49.38]After this is done.
[80:50.11]Price of water drops as production rises.
[80:52.93]Look at how low this is.
[80:54.65]It's going to go even lower.
[80:55.37]Alright.
[81:00.41]Sell that one.
[81:03.53]Alright.
[81:04.01]Water.
[81:06.12]And this is going to be where we go in.
[81:08.34]At six.
[81:10.84]Look at this shit.
[81:11.86]Look at how bad this is doing.
[81:15.27]That's a pretty bearish pennant, by the way.
[81:17.35]I know what that is.
[81:22.37]Come on.
[81:22.89]A little bit more.
[81:23.37]Oh.
[81:27.60]I'm going to turn around.
[81:31.78]Water's going up.
[81:36.04]All in on every trade.
[81:40.79]Uno eats.
[81:43.63]Oh, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[81:50.49]Okay, I'm fine.
[81:51.59]I lost like 30 grand.
[81:56.82]This is going to be such a great place to jump into water though.
[81:59.48]All in.
[81:59.88]It really is.
[82:02.04]Look at this.
[82:02.50]Look how bad this is.
[82:03.46]Just wait until this is over.
[82:04.36]What time is it?
[82:07.03]Alright, I'm going all in.
[82:08.79]The trading day is going to open tomorrow.
[82:09.89]I'm going to go all in on water.
[82:17.36]Diversify your portfolio.
[82:18.88]No.
[82:19.84]Not yet.
[82:20.16]This looks like it's bottoming right now.
[82:27.45]Along on water.
[82:28.43]Hold on.
[82:31.09]Good thing I didn't.
[82:35.47]Maybe now?
[82:35.99]Does this look like a bottom?
[82:40.63]That's a confirmed bottom.
[82:44.14]Confirmed bottom.
[82:45.24]It's coming back.
[82:49.66]Oh, fuck.
[82:55.18]Oh, no.
[82:57.20]Oh, no.
[82:58.85]No.
[82:59.53]How do I send in the goddamn influencers?
[83:03.03]I don't care.
[83:06.20]People hate me.
[83:06.76]I'm fine.
[83:07.50]Hey, we're good.
[83:08.00]Everything's fine.
[83:08.66]Just send in the lobbyists.
[83:20.51]Yeah, there we go.
[83:21.75]Water's doing just fine.
[83:23.09]Uh-oh.
[83:29.62]Confirminating lobbying reports?
[83:31.18]Oh, shit.
[83:38.25]Uh-oh.
[83:39.47]Public opinion is concerned.
[83:40.87]What do I do?
[83:44.87]What do I do?
[83:50.50]Okay, I'm gonna- should I buy a car?
[83:56.28]So I can't, um, put these in the condos?
[84:09.84]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[84:13.05]Keep me in mind.
[84:15.85]Keep in mind.
[84:18.33]I have like a $500,000 trade on water that I need to close tomorrow.
[84:27.09]I'm getting fired for too much negative public attention to the firm.
[84:29.51]I got news for you fucking idiots.
[84:30.61]People hate us anyways.
[84:33.11]areas is just using this to get rid of me because you know what it's none of your fucking business when it happens to you believe me you'll understand in the meantime you can all get fucked all right man you coming to curling next week I don't want to find another partner man all right I gotta keep that in mind
[85:01.66]If shit starts to seriously hit the fan in Volcador, social media is going to be a dumpster fire.
[85:06.48]Can I take these?
[85:13.09]Can I steal this stuff?
[85:20.75]Can I have this?
[85:26.68]This is mine.
[85:35.77]I guess I can just take them.
[85:36.59]Alright, whatever.
[85:42.49]PR disaster.
[85:43.55]Alright, I gotta make public opinion like me tomorrow.
[85:47.67]Did you get fired?
[85:48.37]No, I didn't.
[85:49.79]I mean, not yet.
[85:50.73]Steal office supplies.
[85:56.79]I don't need to steal office supplies.
[86:06.55]Make a few TikToks for good PR.
[86:18.71]We need our apology video.
[86:22.07]People are being cold to you.
[86:23.39]It's probably because you made it past probation and didn't do anything to celebrate.
[86:26.23]I bet Corbin never even suggested it.
[86:28.73]What a stick in the mud.
[86:29.53]I might have to tell you more sometime today.
[86:32.75]Come on.
[86:35.22]The National News Network.
[86:39.58]Tensions are running high in Balcador as news arrives that a bailout package will not be coming for the distressed country, leaving many to assume that the worst is yet to come.
[86:48.70]Huge protests are anticipated as the people of Balcador understand a deprivation that will surely follow the failure of the bailout.
[86:55.07]Rumors are already circulating that northern oil and gas refineries will close immediately.
[87:00.17]The lack of a bailout
[87:01.69]All about ensuring operational- OH THE BELL JUST RANG!
[87:04.42]MARKET'S OPEN!
[87:05.04]EVERYBODY RUN TO YOUR DESK!
[87:07.64]I GOTTA GO, I HAVE A BUNCH OF TRADES I HAVE TO MAKE!
[87:09.74]THE NEWS COMING UP NEXT, I DON'T KNOW!
[87:14.02]You're doing good, but you need to start thinking about international bullshit.
[87:16.97]Earn cheap values and all that.
[87:20.23]Pushing things in one state over another, you know.
[87:23.77]In the end, it's all either worth something on any given day, or it isn't, right?
[87:28.57]But since we're talking about the fate of nations, they expect us to pretend we care.
[87:33.38]You can treat countries like anything else, just remember that when they go up or down, they can take a bunch of other stuff with them.
[87:39.12]Materials, products, and the rest of it.
[87:40.64]Try lobbying them if you want to start making waves in several convenient places at once.
[87:45.35]Shouldn't be rocket science by now.
[87:48.21]Later, traitor.
[87:52.10]As the value of a currency goes up or down, the value of companies which come from the countries of those regions go up and down as well.
[88:01.40]Okay.
[88:03.28]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, my water.
[88:08.26]Water.
[88:09.14]Water going up.
[88:09.87]New safety standards for water industry.
[88:12.59]Means that the number's gonna go up on your screen.
[88:18.07]No, no, don't sell.
[88:18.61]Why would I sell?
[88:19.15]Water's about to go up.
[88:24.33]Who owns this company?
[88:29.87]Okay.
[88:32.16]The Roble?
[88:32.70]Alright, what we're going to do is we're going to... Wait, wait, wait.
[88:36.70]Go back, go back, go back.
[88:37.54]Where am I?
[88:38.88]I need to close this trade.
[88:40.45]Sell it.
[88:40.75]No, not yet.
[88:42.59]Who owns this?
[88:44.87]Sell, sell, sell.
[88:45.61]I don't know.
[88:46.71]I just saw this thing on my screen.
[88:47.77]I don't know what just happened.
[88:48.46]FSU.
[88:49.84]FSU is going to crash.
[88:52.72]The unit dollar is going down.
[88:54.20]I don't know.
[88:54.60]What happened?
[88:55.88]I need to drink tea.
[89:12.16]Okay.
[89:13.26]Now I'm going to go back to my desk.
[89:18.02]Let me slow this down.
[89:22.34]Biggest crackdown still coming.
[89:23.60]Northern coming back.
[89:24.62]Behind the scenes, Northern executives are furious about the protests.
[89:27.74]The government's already making plans to wipe the protesters off the streets, and Northern has agreed to bring in hundreds of workers from other countries.
[89:33.89]Wait, what do you mean?
[89:35.19]The robo will surge at 1430?
[89:50.97]Northern coming back.
[89:51.65]Okay, Northern.
[89:52.53]Oil and gas.
[89:53.13]Check this shit out.
[90:00.01]The roble is tanking.
[90:01.81]Check this out.
[90:04.00]We're gonna make a ton of money.
[90:10.97]and enter right now 13 this shit's coming back 14 30. hold it I'm gonna get fired how do I make pr how do I what do I do how do I do pr I'm just gonna wait I could I should I jump on board of this
[90:40.96]Stop lobbying.
[90:42.19]Alright, no more lobbying after this.
[90:49.61]Don't cheat.
[90:50.61]Alright, I won't lobby anymore.
[90:52.01]I promise.
[90:55.03]New safety sense for water.
[91:01.06]The currency crashed and then I jumped into the company that the currency is based on and then at 1430 the company is going to go up.
[91:06.30]That's what it said.
[91:06.78]Starbucks is going up.
[91:12.98]Buy Starnux before the global collapse.
[91:14.74]Global collapse?
[91:24.69]Oh.
[91:24.75]What time is it?
[91:35.73]Come on.
[91:37.07]I'll exit when it's at 1000.
[91:43.70]Clickbait?
[91:44.34]Well, I'll make some money on the clickbait.
[91:45.86]Just do badly and the public opinion goes back up.
[91:57.45]Alright, almost there.
[92:02.13]I'm doubling down.
[92:02.79]Double down.
[92:12.10]More.
[92:12.74]Keep it going.
[92:13.24]I want more.
[92:17.56]I'm going to get out of this trade.
[92:19.81]I'm ready to liquidate this.
[92:24.29]Water's gone.
[92:24.77]I can't pay attention to that right now.
[92:27.33]What's going on?
[92:29.39]Hey.
[92:29.53]Excuse me?
[92:33.10]What just happened?
[92:33.60]Did we just get hacked?
[92:35.98]Yeah.
[92:36.48]Stop.
[92:36.68]Leave me alone.
[92:37.48]Did everything go dark for a few seconds on your end just now?
[92:39.98]It did over here.
[92:40.64]Alright.
[92:41.00]I got a lot of money in this trade.
[92:44.01]I know we have backup generators, so it wasn't the electricity.
[92:47.03]Oh well, probably nothing.
[92:47.84]Okay, here comes the news.
[92:51.50]A tragedy unfolds tonight in the Democratic Republic of Balcador.
[92:58.13]Lately, unemployed oil workers took to the streets, approaching a sudden closing of northern oil and gas refineries across the country.
[93:10.82]White police crack down on the protest with brutal efficiency, killing as many as 50 protesters, including hundreds of people.
[93:17.22]Did I do that?
[93:17.76]These developments follow the failure of Northern to secure a bailout from the Balkan government.
[93:26.86]Bailout which could have prevented the violence that has, at least at the moment, finally abated.
[93:30.19]Oh my god, I sent in the lobbyists to make the car- what did I do?
[93:34.53]Sources tell us that the government and Northern were close to a bailout when fierce opposition emerged from within the ruling party.
[93:43.97]The newly revitalized opposition is claiming that a deal with Northern would have required unacceptable cuts to vital social programs.
[93:49.51]What did I do?
[93:50.14]Investor confidence in Northern has really rarely been lower and will likely continue as the- as the- Oh, shit.
[94:00.48]We'll update you with more as the situation devi- I- Get out.
[94:03.76]Okay.
[94:08.70]And then we're gonna- we're gonna go short.
[94:11.66]Um...
[94:17.70]AK-24-7?
[94:18.62]Oh, she got out way too early.
[94:21.02]Fuck.
[94:25.30]Dark Roaster's Coffee.
[94:29.02]Are your condos worth 50 people, Jerry?
[94:31.68]God damn it.
[94:33.47]God.
[94:39.21]I... Hold on.
[94:40.41]I'm gonna be clean from now on.
[94:42.51]Ooh, I need to make some more money on this.
[94:52.85]Okay, let's short the gas.
[94:54.61]Should I?
[94:59.99]Looks like it's going to come down.
[95:00.87]I'm closing in 60 minutes.
[95:02.29]Coffee is up.
[95:06.58]Water.
[95:07.12]Who else?
[95:07.44]Do they all have water?
[95:08.54]It's just the Earth Drill Dark Roast Coffee.
[95:12.06]Buy it?
[95:13.20]I don't know.
[95:13.68]I don't think so.
[95:16.26]I don't think I buy this.
[95:16.94]I think I short this.
[95:18.40]Electronics going up.
[95:19.16]Who owns that?
[95:20.81]Is it electronics?
[95:21.84]It's coal.
[95:22.64]Where's electronics?
[95:25.96]Soda?
[95:26.86]Coffee and plastic.
[95:27.88]Electronics!
[95:29.54]The unidollar is all over the place.
[95:31.00]Unidollar is the, uh, the bulk of your currency, isn't it?
[95:32.72]Huh?
[95:32.84]The unidollar is the currency!
[95:52.64]Come on, go down, go down, go down!
[96:05.71]It's the ro- oh shit, it's the roble.
[96:16.58]Fuck.
[96:18.46]Public opinion's back, it's okay.
[96:22.84]Thank God.
[96:24.38]I was supposed to mention this to you at the time, but the firm has a tradition that everybody who makes it past probation is supposed to throw a party for everybody.
[96:32.64]It isn't mandatory, but some of the brokers here believe that socializing outside of work will determine how far you can go at the company.
[96:38.60]I wouldn't overestimate it.
[96:39.48]I've fired a lot of popular losers.
[96:42.52]Regardless, you should see an interface in your terminal that will help you plan it.
[96:47.32]Okay, organize a party.
[96:49.32]Party planned in condo.
[97:03.80]Just throwing a bust at the Pakistani's head.
[97:05.70]Oh my god.
[97:07.28]The prison.
[97:09.00]Jesus.
[97:13.09]I lost 50 grand on a unidollar.
[97:17.49]Members of the Ferio staff gather at your apartment.
[97:22.91]For drinks.
[97:24.08]Before you head out on the town for a night of bar crawling and whatever else.
[97:31.73]Several of your co-workers remark on it.
[97:33.85]It sounds like a kid's birthday party.
[97:36.57]Several of your co-workers remark on your latest acquisitions, taking care to quickly spin the conversation around to similar or better things that they've recently purchased themselves.
[97:45.34]Before everybody heads out, you take one last look around.
[97:47.58]That got really quiet.
[97:51.94]Satisfied at how impressed everybody was, all of this is yours and you earned it.
[97:59.48]Shut the lights, lock the door, and the rest of the night becomes a blur.
[98:02.26]Oh god.
[98:02.74]Everybody have fun at the party?
[98:17.22]Worst part about how many people get fired here is not knowing what you're supposed to do with them on social media.
[98:22.08]Should I stay connected with them?
[98:23.00]It's so awkward.
[98:24.29]One time, one of them even wrote me and was all like, I think you're so talented.
[98:27.73]It was so amazing to work with you.
[98:29.85]They think I can get them their job back just because of who my family is?
[98:33.61]Honestly, it's so rude.
[98:34.49]I hate it.
[98:34.95]Take responsibility for your own life.
[98:45.16]Hello?
[98:45.36]I thought I told you, when you get these challenges, you're getting them for a reason.
[98:51.57]You're intentionally ignoring them because you're bitter, and nobody is filling you in on the strategy.
[98:55.89]You might be too emotional for this job.
[98:58.45]You see me giving a fuck?
[98:59.89]No, you don't.
[99:01.01]Because I get paid either way, and that's all that matters.
[99:03.68]And so do you.
[99:04.18]So stop fucking around, follow the orders so we can get rich, get the fuck out of here, and never look back.
[99:10.50]You have any idea?
[99:12.46]What the hell?
[99:17.82]Nice streamer setup.
[99:22.00]You don't need this many monitors.
[99:23.92]Three.
[99:27.38]I have four, but that's because I wanted the fourth one.
[99:32.66]I have an open trade.
[99:33.30]In what?
[99:38.85]Dark roast coffee.
[99:40.19]We need to send the lobbyist in.
[99:41.23]Send in the lobbyist.
[99:51.04]I just lost everything.
[99:52.71]Send in the lobbyists.
[99:53.53]Short it down.
[99:53.95]I need coffee to go down.
[99:59.11]I need coffee to go down.
[100:00.23]Down, down, down, down, down.
[100:01.95]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[100:03.29]Come on.
[100:04.23]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[100:06.43]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[100:07.63]More.
[100:08.49]Crush it.
[100:18.92]You said no more lobbyists.
[100:20.64]Yeah, but I had to.
[100:22.72]I'm going to get destroyed.
[100:29.13]Get munitions price 11% lower?
[100:31.17]Okay, I'm going to get out of here with a $38,000 loss.
[100:35.59]What do you think?
[100:40.51]Should I just wait?
[100:45.38]Should I just take the loss?
[100:46.26]Yes.
[100:49.06]I'm taking the loss.
[100:49.70]Whatever.
[100:49.98]I have $620,000.
[100:50.76]It's fine.
[100:53.10]Okay.
[100:53.42]Munitions.
[100:59.63]Munitions.
[101:00.05]11% lower.
[101:00.27]That's all I had to do.
[101:02.65]Here it is.
[101:02.93]We have coal now.
[101:03.67]Okay.
[101:05.81]What's this?
[101:06.21]New carbohydrate research sparks intensified foodstuff lobby.
[101:11.39]Wait.
[101:11.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[101:13.01]Oil going up.
[101:19.14]Unexpected demand for all your oil chokes existing supply raising price too late.
[101:24.06]I miss plastics.
[101:26.68]Did I though?
[101:28.99]What about the soda company?
[101:35.23]FSU going up.
[101:36.27]The FSU dollar.
[101:36.89]Soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda.
[101:44.25]Hold it.
[101:46.93]Oh, my God.
[101:47.71]Oh, my God.
[101:48.09]The soda and double.
[101:49.03]I've got double whammied here.
[101:52.04]I got triple whammied here.
[101:53.18]Soda.
[101:53.70]Southern soda announces new brand and their currency went up.
[102:02.46]I should have went more.
[102:03.20]I should have went all in.
[102:03.82]I'm going to hold this one.
[102:08.53]The munitions are lower.
[102:09.77]How am I going to do that?
[102:12.53]Although plastics is really killing us.
[102:16.94]Not yet.
[102:18.51]Hold on.
[102:23.47]And get out now.
[102:25.89]Okay, what do we got?
[102:26.83]Munitions have got to go lower.
[102:27.91]Lobby it down.
[102:33.38]Oh, then Soda's still doing well.
[102:34.92]Is it still going up?
[102:39.87]Throw up munitions companies?
[102:46.66]I... Alright, alright.
[102:49.17]I'm in.
[102:49.55]I'm in.
[102:50.03]I'm in.
[102:50.61]I'm in.
[102:52.13]Alright, I'm in.
[102:59.15]Lobby everything.
[102:59.89]I can't do that.
[103:00.55]Alright, I'm out.
[103:01.91]I'm out.
[103:02.19]I'm out.
[103:02.47]I'm out.
[103:02.67]That was a bad trade.
[103:03.21]I'm out.
[103:04.61]Electronics going down.
[103:06.33]Strong economic performance in Balkador.
[103:08.19]Dark roast coffee.
[103:08.81]Let's go.
[103:14.51]I need... Now we need a... We need coffee to go up.
[103:19.94]Come on, give me a coffee right here.
[103:21.58]Coffee going up.
[103:28.67]Munitions have to keep going down.
[103:33.39]Ken, drop it.

[104:30.77]Coal, coal, coal, coal, coal.
[104:32.03]Who has coal?
[104:33.31]Who has coal?
[104:34.39]This drilling company does.
[104:46.72]Plastic's going down.
[104:47.52]Munition's going up.
[104:49.92]Whoa!
[104:53.24]What happened?
[104:55.21]What the fuck just happened?
[104:56.15]Why'd they do that?
[104:57.51]Coal's supposed to be going up.
[104:58.77]Rising protection has been coal producing.
[105:01.07]Does this guy just get dumped on?
[105:06.36]Who dumped that shit on me?
[105:07.54]What was that?
[105:08.98]Read the news?
[105:17.64]There's an enemy lobbyist.
[105:21.94]You wanna play that game?
[105:26.49]Fine.
[105:28.33]We'll play that game.
[105:40.56]Imagine seeing this chart.
[105:42.56]I'd be like, what the fuck is happening?
[105:44.74]What is happening?
[105:46.42]Oh, no!
[105:47.84]I didn't sell!
[105:59.49]What just happened?
[106:02.00]Emergency PR?
[106:09.67]Minus 25% for a new car.
[106:11.39]I'll take it.
[106:17.40]What'd I get?
[106:17.76]I can sell these?
[106:22.26]90?
[106:22.28]100?
[106:25.72]I made money.
[106:32.45]Lease your first condo.
[106:34.53]I think I should probably sell my first condo.
[106:43.44]Put them in the condo.
[106:48.82]Okay, I'm going to put... What's the most expensive one?
[106:51.00]This is a $90,000 car.
[106:53.57]I'm putting it in this condo.
[106:56.05]Holy shit, I can lease this for $14,000 a day?
[107:00.73]What if I put two cars in here?
[107:03.13]Oh my god, yeah.
[107:04.15]Okay.
[107:04.65]Okay.
[107:15.92]Holy shit.
[107:19.04]Okay, I'll take it.
[107:24.68]This is my condo.
[107:27.86]One days of cleaning remaining.
[107:29.10]What's that mean?
[107:31.21]Why do I hate chat?
[107:35.53]I don't.
[107:35.91]Alright, I have to close that.
[107:37.73]What trade do I have open right now?
[107:38.93]I don't even remember.
[107:45.88]Oh, the party, okay.
[107:52.86]Coal, alright.
[107:53.90]I gotta be ready to get the hell out of coal.
[107:55.02]Understand that the more you screw up, the more difficult it becomes to make it look like a misunderstanding?
[108:02.67]Public opinion is a complex thing.
[108:04.31]A spectacular amount of time and money is invested into expressing it within a single metric on your dashboard.
[108:10.88]I think I got my one screw-up that I'm allowed, like Super Mario life.
[108:34.39]Well, somebody anti-lobbied me.
[108:37.06]I lobbied and then they lobbied me back.
[108:38.56]It wasn't... I bought the price, they lobbied me down, so I lobbied them back.
[108:52.10]I'm thinking about going back to school.
[108:54.12]I've always been interested in marine biology or maybe jungle biology.
[108:57.83]I know it isn't all about cute animals, but I do love orangutans and their scrunched up little faces.
[109:02.53]We've hurt the earth so much.
[109:03.89]The least we can do is save the animals.
[109:05.43]Trust me, you don't even want to know how cruel people can be to them.
[109:08.06]It makes me sick.
[109:14.38]I have to get this trade ready to close.
[109:17.77]I can't talk to anybody right now.
[109:19.17]Okay, where am I?
[109:20.93]Okay, this has to sell immediately when the market opens.
[109:26.20]I can't.
[109:26.70]I just gotta go.
[109:41.43]Good.
[109:42.27]Good.
[109:43.31]Oh, man.
[109:45.52]Oh man.
[109:46.22]Okay.
[109:47.16]Okay.
[109:48.30]Alright.
[109:48.74]This is looking good.
[109:52.28]Okay.
[109:53.08]Nice.
[109:53.86]I'm happy about it.
[109:54.64]Electronics going up.
[109:59.11]Close it.
[110:00.91]Or should we wait for... We wait for something to do with coal.
[110:06.55]Hold it.
[110:06.81]Hold it.
[110:07.05]Hold it.
[110:07.27]Hold it.
[110:07.57]Coal is going to go up.
[110:09.31]It's going to be a big thing with coal.
[110:11.16]Plastics.
[110:11.58]Come on.
[110:12.10]FSU.
[110:12.42]Come on.
[110:13.22]FSU is not this one.
[110:15.83]There you go.
[110:17.57]That's me.
[110:17.85]All right.
[110:18.65]I'll take the hundred grand.
[110:20.01]What we got?
[110:21.11]In one neighborhood, a coffee comm service.
[110:23.17]I need to speak to coffee.
[110:30.68]Blow it down.
[110:31.14]I almost had a million dollars.
[110:44.27]Lobby more?
[110:44.95]No, I'm not going to lobby at all today.
[110:48.51]I need to read this.
[110:51.21]So, in one neighborhood, a coffee comm services.
[110:52.95]Following years of protests over gentrification, residents of one small community seem to finally be accepting the presence of Starnux, a chain which they once held solely responsible for the end of the beloved local coffee stand.
[111:01.84]Sam's coffee meant a lot to us, but I guess they wore us down.
[111:05.90]Sam died a few years after they drove him out of the business, too, and he had been the one who was really leading the fight.
[111:13.09]New rifle ammo design poised to shake up munitions industry.
[111:17.11]Death Blossom, a new type of ammunition with a popular RAE-27 semi-automatic rifle, is renewing the efforts of lobbyists against the munitions industry.
[111:25.85]Who insist it be taken off store shelves.
[111:29.53]Okay.
[111:31.33]AK-27... AK-24-7 stock surges at free state set in stockpile ammunition.
[111:34.43]Okay.
[111:38.58]We're gonna play... We're gonna play the... Oh, never mind.
[111:40.98]We're not gonna play that today.
[111:44.79]Alright, let me look at the daily chart.
[111:45.85]Let's take a look around.
[111:46.55]Soda, plastic.
[111:47.93]FSU is up.
[111:50.49]Lodging.
[111:50.99]Gas is down.
[111:53.35]Water is way down.
[111:54.35]Green grocers are doing a fight.
[111:58.75]What about, um... I think I'm going to make a water play here.
[112:07.42]I think I'm going to go for water.
[112:17.03]I would have bought this.
[112:22.57]I wonder if I should just short this.
[112:27.21]If this dollar is overrated.
[112:29.31]What?
[112:31.13]Oh!
[112:34.91]Get a trade in you fucking idiot!
[112:46.74]This is coming crashing down.
[112:48.14]I didn't even have to lobby.
[112:49.12]I just waited for the dollar to be bad.
[112:50.36]Is that bottoming out?
[113:02.29]Good thing I got out of coffee.
[113:10.87]Bottom is zero.
[113:12.49]Food stuff's going up.
[113:18.22]Close this trade.
[113:23.74]Foodstuffs.
[113:24.32]Going up.
[113:25.36]This is not foodstuffs.
[113:26.89]Get out.
[113:32.97]Where's foodstuffs?
[113:39.98]You shorted not long.
[113:41.22]That's alright.
[113:42.18]I got 698,000.
[113:45.50]All right, get the Democratic Republic of Bogota price 11% higher.
[113:53.75]And then some lobbyists.
[113:59.99]It's going on oil and gas.
[114:04.66]This is good to me.
[114:05.20]Here we go.
[114:10.82]Nice.
[114:13.64]I'm not going to use lobbyist.
[114:14.62]Well, it told me I had to.
[114:19.85]Stop lobbying.
[114:20.81]Get the price 11% higher.
[114:22.59]I can't do that.
[114:23.25]I can only do that with a lobbyist.
[114:34.45]It's almost there.
[114:34.93]I'm almost done.
[114:40.12]Come on.
[114:41.06]A little more.
[114:47.59]Come on!
[114:48.07]A little more!
[114:49.57]Have the currency go up a little higher.
[114:51.27]Only two more cents.
[114:54.27]Come on!
[114:56.17]No!
[115:00.75]There we go.
[115:02.01]There it goes.
[115:08.61]Take up higher.
[115:09.21]I wonder if this game is awakening any future traders?
[115:18.61]The markets are fucking terrifying, be careful.
[115:21.93]Almost there.
[115:26.32]Alright, sell that.
[115:29.90]Alright, now I just need the currency to go up a little more.
[115:31.98]Yeah, FSU is down.
[115:36.28]Coffee is down.
[115:37.50]Come on.
[115:40.46]Come on, I just get a... One more time and that's it, I promise.

[116:25.16]Munitions down.
[116:29.03]The FSU up.
[116:30.05]Oh, my God.
[116:30.63]Get out.
[116:33.63]Holy shit.
[116:34.31]Did I get out?
[116:35.67]Thank God.
[116:36.41]All right.
[116:36.85]I probably just lost the game.
[116:37.93]All right.
[116:43.73]What's the play here?
[116:48.81]I think I'm going to short this at the top here.
[116:55.01]Look at how bad this looks.
[116:56.79]Starnux is up.
[116:57.79]Greengrocer is up.
[116:58.76]Coffee.
[116:59.66]Probably maybe coffee.
[117:03.00]We know eats.
[117:03.48]I don't know what's the play here.
[117:05.40]What's the play?
[117:13.21]I'm in the top.
[117:14.27]Pepe left.
[117:19.52]I mean, this is like, this is going down.
[117:21.78]This is going down.
[117:22.82]I'm in.
[117:25.58]A nice pop.
[117:26.50]This shit's tanking.
[117:30.29]The FSU is just the public finance.
[117:32.49]Financial crisis.
[117:33.19]The Free State Union casts fear.
[117:35.53]Lots of fear here.
[117:36.39]Munitions are like not doing well.
[117:37.81]Price of munitions drop as production rises.
[117:39.61]A lot of bullshit going on here.
[117:43.77]That was a nice little pop, but it's not going to last.
[117:46.93]Munitions are dead.
[117:47.91]The mission is done.
[117:48.91]It's over.
[117:52.68]Any second now.
[117:59.72]People seem to be not believing that.
[118:02.04]People don't really care.
[118:04.19]It's losing traction.
[118:09.99]Drop.
[118:11.29]Just drop.
[118:13.51]32 is the new floor, old man.
[118:15.95]We'll see.
[118:22.71]Here we go.
[118:24.11]Here it comes.
[118:24.87]Here comes the really bad news.
[118:30.18]Bad news incoming.
[118:32.48]Really bad news coming up.
[118:37.00]Yeah, you thought that was a bull trap is what we call it here in the office.
[118:42.73]This is a bull trap.
[118:43.43]Watch this.
[118:44.71]No, yeah, you got nothing.
[118:53.81]Come on.
[119:02.72]I'm not sending any... Aha.
[119:04.06]And there it is.
[119:04.54]There's the bull trap.
[119:05.41]Trap set.
[119:05.93]There it is.
[119:06.27]Goodbye.
[119:07.93]Told you it was a bull trap.
[119:15.98]You're finished.
[119:20.57]Come on, get this.
[119:21.69]I want likes.
[119:22.45]Government of FSU is spending large amounts of money to fuel unrestricted.
[119:26.28]Yeah, let's go.
[119:27.00]Yeah, goodbye.
[119:38.66]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[119:41.10]Thank you.
[119:43.18]No, no.
[119:43.66]What is this stock doing?
[119:47.97]Go down.
[119:49.69]Go down.
[119:51.85]I'm not closing this until it's below 30.
[119:53.37]There we go.
[119:59.50]See?
[120:01.72]See?
[120:02.93]It's bottoming out.
[120:03.77]I don't think so.
[120:05.43]This has still got a lot of traction in the news here.
[120:09.55]Below 30, I'm telling you.
[120:22.21]This game is bad for chat.
[120:23.83]Everyone's getting invested.
[120:26.19]There we go.
[120:27.53]All right.
[120:28.05]Now I'll close it now.
[120:30.76]Right now.
[120:31.38]Hold on.
[120:33.14]Hold on.
[120:33.80]Hold on.
[120:34.26]Under 30.
[120:34.78]I told you.
[120:35.18]All right.
[120:39.32]Oh, this is not.
[120:40.16]This does not look good.
[120:43.48]Okay.
[120:43.82]I'm out.
[120:45.38]I'm out.
[120:47.32]All right.
[120:47.64]Now I'm out for real.
[120:49.46]I'm out now for real in 10 seconds.
[120:51.62]Now.
[120:53.82]Okay, done.
[120:56.30]Okay, good.
[120:58.62]This game sucks.
[120:59.34]This game does not suck.
[121:00.20]This game is fun.
[121:01.07]I've been looking for a stock market game like this.
[121:06.05]Six, seven, eight months ago.
[121:07.03]Remember we were talking about wanting a game like this?
[121:10.77]Oh, I wanted it so bad.
[121:19.06]Currency, okay.
[121:20.60]Alright, let's go get... Markets are closing anyways.
[121:22.64]I did good for the day.
[121:29.28]Speed this back up.
[121:29.94]This game is slot machines with graphs?
[121:43.90]I mean, that's just the stock market.
[121:50.12]You just described the stock market.
[122:08.68]The stock market is just a shitload of people.
[122:12.27]Like 50 people all hovering around the roulette table.
[122:15.93]All screaming the numbers that they're playing.
[122:18.71]And arguing with each other as to why you should play certain numbers.
[122:22.05]It's just a roulette table with like 100 people at the table.
[122:26.98]Alright.
[122:27.60]Fire.
[122:28.00]I won.
[122:33.96]Another person.
[122:34.52]Down.
[122:37.00]No evidence was disclosed today.
[122:38.26]I didn't lobby that much.
[122:39.77]Get some cash here.
[122:43.65]Holy shit.
[122:46.79]Should I get another condo?
[122:48.07]Maybe another car.
[122:49.09]Should I buy another one?
[123:05.21]Words on the screen make no sense to me.
[123:08.57]They make sense- Hey, they make sense to me.
[123:11.15]I know what I'm doing.
[123:12.93]Should I organize a condo party?
[123:19.23]Nah, I'm good for the day.
[123:26.59]Half of these condos don't even have furniture.
[123:32.15]Do Peter Griffin trading stocks?
[123:36.07]Put stuff in the condo.
[123:37.19]Yeah, you know what?
[123:38.03]I can't.
[123:38.81]They're already there.
[123:39.41]I have to buy stuff.
[123:44.79]It's $80,000 to buy furniture.
[123:46.40]I can't.
[123:54.42]How do I leave?
[123:54.88]I don't leave?
[124:06.48]Oh, I didn't click go home.
[124:07.64]Oh, okay.
[124:12.06]I like this game.
[124:12.68]This game is good.
[124:13.68]This is fun.
[124:14.21]I like this.
[124:14.67]Whoa.
[124:21.67]I don't need this shit right now.
[124:22.39]You can't be really serious about Furious letting me go.
[124:26.37]Because everybody I beat was some nobody's shit face analyst.
[124:30.07]I've been working for years.
[124:31.57]I've been loyal to you for years.
[124:32.71]Please leave the building calmly.
[124:34.51]I'll have security meet you on the ground floor.
[124:39.79]Congratulations on your promotion to associate.
[124:44.61]I might say that you've made it through your real probation period.
[124:47.16]The vast majority of our analysts never make it as far as you have.
[124:49.42]You need to prove yourself and we may promote you to vice president.
[124:54.22]At that point, you'll get a taste of what it really means to be part of a firm like Ferrios.
[124:58.40]Vice president?
[125:02.91]Vice president?
[125:05.65]Holy shit, I've been here for five days.
[125:11.34]You guys are psycho.
[125:16.54]Whoa, that was weird.
[125:17.34]I think, is the game saving?
[125:21.63]Hopefully the game has been saving.
[125:32.33]Law and disorder.
[125:36.65]This is insane, Lois.
[125:38.11]Imagine the time I sent GME to the moon.
[125:40.83]Where do you think you're going?
[125:45.49]What are you even doing here?
[125:46.37]We're executing a search warrant.
[125:49.15]Knowing what you know, I'm sure you can expect charges to follow shortly.
[125:52.67]What?
[125:54.31]Don't even think about going anywhere else.
[125:55.63]The passports of every employee of this firm have been flagged.
[125:58.77]Get lost.
[125:59.21]What are you talking about?
[126:07.86]Hey, don't touch my computer.
[126:09.11]The hell?
[126:22.68]German's going to prison.
[126:25.26]This is scripted.
[126:35.09]Welcome to the show.
[126:42.54]Good morning.
[126:42.88]I'm glad we're all able to take a bit of time off even if it was unexpected.
[126:45.50]Did you meet Walker yet?
[126:47.34]I hear she's your new rival.
[126:49.14]Ignore her if she starts talking nonsense.
[126:50.69]She's not an intellectual.
[126:51.75]She's hallucinating.
[126:53.41]They tried to ban hard drugs here for a while to keep the coke under control.
[126:57.47]Who knew we would end up with a person on some kind of experimental LSD meth ketamine combo instead?
[127:02.79]I don't care how good it makes her at math or computers or whatever.
[127:05.47]Between you and me, not worth it.
[127:07.96]They're a psycho and not the cool kind.
[127:13.85]Do you play anything else besides solitaire?
[127:15.99]Holy shit, that's so boring.
[127:18.98]If you think you've got any chance at getting that VP position over me, you're even crazier than I am.
[127:23.78]Understand something?
[127:24.48]I don't sleep, I don't eat and drink intravenously.
[127:27.20]I live in the algorithm.
[127:28.40]I see the constellations.
[127:30.16]The data of everything, everywhere.
[127:31.94]I'm ready for the future.
[127:32.66]You don't even have one.
[127:34.00]Now get out of my fucking face!
[127:39.82]Alright, the trading is on.
[127:41.62]Let's go!
[127:45.67]Violence continues to spread across the Democratic Republic of Balcador, with many saying that the country is now on the brink of full-scale civil war.
[127:50.83]Really?
[127:54.31]Well, government representatives deny that foodstuffs, foodstuffs, foodstuffs, and livestock, and foodstuffs, and livestock, where is it?
[128:01.27]Foodstuffs, and livestock, and livestock, and foodstuffs, where is it?
[128:04.40]I don't know where it is!
[128:05.82]I'm so late to this trade!
[128:08.16]Uno Eats Infinity Mart.
[128:10.88]Holy shit, this is expensive.
[128:13.08]I missed it.
[128:18.23]The Euro.
[128:19.39]Chaos in the markets led to... I need to drink fucking tea.
[128:21.80]God damn it.
[128:33.81]Slow it down.
[128:34.33]Let's go.
[128:36.31]Ammunition.
[128:42.46]Weapons will surge this afternoon.
[128:43.70]Yeah, I know.
[128:45.00]I need weapons.
[128:47.64]Products.
[128:48.00]Weapons.
[128:49.76]Missiles.
[128:54.48]We're going big on missiles.
[128:59.34]Arms dealing?
[129:00.26]No.
[129:00.64]I'm buying weapons.
[129:02.94]Buy then sell then buy again.
[129:08.19]God damn it!
[129:08.93]Leave me alone!
[129:10.57]We need you to start taking long-term positions in some of the companies the firm is dealing with.
[129:16.69]I've unlocked the ability for your terminal to start collecting dividends.
[129:19.28]With dividends, you will generate ongoing revenue from the stock of any company you've bought on a regular basis.
[129:28.18]These are pieces of their profits, so make sure you pick companies that are making one.
[129:32.12]Dividends can be far more lucrative over time than constantly trying to guess which way the market is going.
[129:38.03]Especially if you have confidence that a company, a weapons manufacturer, for example, is going to continue to grow and do well because of some kind of event.
[129:44.54]You're in the big leagues now.
[129:46.26]If you stubbornly hold onto the wrong company for a long time, the results can be catastrophic.
[129:50.76]Weigh your options carefully.
[129:53.02]Bye.
[129:56.29]Missiletech AG.
[129:57.45]Sign the dividend agreement.
[129:59.35]The position will earn expected dividends at market closure every day, but cannot be liquidated until you pay the penalty fee.
[130:08.66]Well, that's $700,000 in... That's all my money.
[130:14.76]I don't have any money.
[130:18.70]Alright, missiles are going up.
[130:19.70]Buy... Wait.
[130:24.54]How many do I have?
[130:25.06]$710,000?
[130:25.08]How do I have $970,000 here?
[130:25.86]Okay.
[130:38.92]I have 1.46 million dollars in that coin.
[130:41.88]Oh my goodness gracious.
[130:45.22]I've signed the dividend agreement.
[130:56.24]Every single cent I own is in this.
[131:00.46]Okay, this afternoon it's going to pop.
[131:01.82]Here it goes.
[131:02.38]Oh my god.
[131:04.94]What should I do?
[131:07.00]I have 1.7 million dollars.
[131:09.24]What the fuck should I do?
[131:10.92]This is huge.
[131:12.28]Should I pay the penalty and just take fucking millions of dollars?
[131:19.69]Hold it?
[131:20.23]Should I hold it?
[131:21.25]This is... This is 1.8... 1.9 million dollars.
[131:27.17]Lobby it?
[131:27.75]Now?
[131:29.45]Oh my god.
[131:33.54]I can't.
[131:34.30]I have to... Weapons.
[131:36.92]All right.
[131:37.26]I did it.
[131:37.56]I did it.
[131:37.82]Now I'm going to liquidate it.
[131:38.70]I'm going to take two... Three million dollars.
[131:40.40]Oh, my God.
[131:40.94]This is a big mistake.
[131:41.62]This is a mistake.
[131:45.93]Two million.
[131:51.61]Two point... Two point one million.
[131:58.84]Euric Dominion?
[132:00.82]The euro's overvalued.
[132:02.08]Is this euro?
[132:03.64]No.
[132:05.72]Hold it?
[132:06.82]Hold it, hold it, hold it.
[132:07.86]There's a civil war happening.
[132:09.42]Yeah, but this is two and a half million dollars.
[132:13.82]You won't get the dividend if you sell it.
[132:17.99]Oh, man.
[132:22.51]Weapons are surging.
[132:25.53]Hold for the dividend.
[132:26.27]Hold for the dividend.
[132:31.93]Ah, it's going to come down though.
[132:33.07]Alright, I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist.
[132:37.87]You need to have diamond hands.
[132:42.64]Countries of Sienna.
[132:44.20]Sienna is this company.
[132:48.72]Sienna's not doing well.
[132:50.34]At all.
[132:50.56]Sienna.
[133:00.43]Um.
[133:01.57]Sell now.
[133:02.13]Jesus.
[133:02.81]Should I?
[133:03.11]I missed the dividend.
[133:07.49]This is $100,000 in dividend.
[133:15.55]Plastics going.
[133:19.57]No.
[133:20.19]It's okay.
[133:20.95]It's $2.2 million still.
[133:23.55]It's alright.
[133:23.95]I have to hold this to the end of the day.
[133:32.18]Okay, now I'm going to... What the fuck just happened?
[133:37.96]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you mean weapons down?
[133:40.54]Regulation of the weapons industry is ongoing.
[133:42.53]Get out!
[133:48.63]2.1 million.
[133:51.75]Sell, sell, sell!
[133:56.24]Of 1.8 million dollars, I'm good.
[134:00.61]I thought I sold it.
[134:01.45]I thought I sold it.
[134:02.15]No, I got out of the dividend agreement.
[134:05.81]Okay, get back in.
[134:08.77]I have 1.8 million dollars.
[134:10.09]Alright, let me... I'm gonna get back in.
[134:19.08]You sold the bottom.
[134:21.02]I did, didn't I?
[134:23.86]Alright, 500,000.
[134:24.48]Lock that up as a dividend.
[134:26.46]Sign the dividend agreement.
[134:31.02]I have 1.3 million now to play with.
[134:39.73]Southern Soda.
[134:41.73]Long.
[134:47.73]Southern Soda smells like blood.
[134:49.01]Wait, why is that a good thing?
[134:51.23]I just bought on the news.
[134:53.48]What?
[134:55.50]Why is that a good thing?
[135:00.25]Smells like blood.
[135:07.99]Southern soda.
[135:11.57]Beverages are up too.
[135:12.51]Look at this.
[135:12.87]This is gonna be good.
[135:16.93]I'm good.
[135:17.47]I'm good.
[135:17.69]I'm good.
[135:17.91]I got my dividends coming in.
[135:28.18]Check likes on the news for how real it is.
[135:32.52]I mean, that looks pretty... That smell is more than money.
[135:35.68]It's blood.
[135:36.22]Buy Southern Soda with everything you got.
[135:37.74]Why?
[135:38.02]Why would you want to have something that smells like blood?
[135:41.24]Alright, I'm thinking of closing this.
[135:55.84]Do you guys remember that time when Chuck E. Cheese came to the stream?
[136:01.35]And when I showed the me kissing Chuck E. Cheese picture, the stock price went down by like 5% or something.
[136:10.30]Didn't that actually happen?
[136:17.22]That's so stupid.
[136:21.96]I don't think it was related at all, but somebody brought it up.
[136:24.27]They were like, hey dude, I like did some math and I did a little thing.
[136:26.69]I kind of did some timing here.
[136:29.03]This is when he appeared on your stream and this is what their stock value was.
[136:33.37]And this is when you showed the kiss.
[136:34.69]I was like, no, that's not accurate.
[136:39.36]That's just nothing.
[136:40.04]It doesn't mean anything.
[136:40.64]Alright, I'm out.
[136:44.08]That was a good trade.
[136:45.58]1.4 million.
[136:46.88]What do I got here?
[136:50.59]How's the missiles doing?
[136:55.29]We need weapons.
[136:55.83]Alright, missiles.
[136:58.77]I have to hold it for the dividend.
[137:08.43]What's going on with Starnux?
[137:10.75]Plastic going up.
[137:12.79]Only got like a few more minutes in the trading day.
[137:14.58]Alright, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to... Let's go all in.
[137:17.76]Let's go all in.
[137:20.70]I'm gonna make that even.
[137:21.98]You know what?
[137:22.76]Market's closed.
[137:23.34]I'm gonna get my dividend.
[137:30.05]This guy's negative 18,000.
[137:31.45]He fucked up big time.
[137:35.97]It's okay.
[137:43.36]I got 200 grand.
[137:43.88]Should I buy some more cars?
[137:50.75]Sell for $187,000?
[137:51.21]I think I'm just gonna do that.
[137:59.58]That's 200 grand.
[138:08.08]I can buy a house now.
[138:10.84]Buy a house.
[138:12.23]Market value.
[138:13.27]Decoration slots.
[138:15.70]Oh my goodness.
[138:16.62]Okay, hold on a minute.
[138:18.66]I'm gonna... This is gonna make me a shitload of money.
[138:22.20]I'm gonna sell this house for $83,000.
[138:24.68]And then I'm gonna buy some cars.
[138:32.31]Oh yeah, come on.
[138:34.07]I'll check this shit out.

[138:57.73]Don't need to... We're buying houses now.
[138:59.27]I need to buy paintings.
[139:04.36]Oh, I need a million dollars.
[139:07.86]Now, lease the house.

[139:11.30]Because I need more decorations and shit.
[139:13.54]Designer chair.

[139:19.69]Okay.
[139:19.85]Here's what I'm going to do.
[139:20.61]Ready?
[139:20.81]Check this out.

[139:47.29]I just spent a bunch of money.
[139:48.09]That's okay.
[139:48.67]This is where I live.
[139:49.59]I live here.
[139:51.25]Wait, do I even have a house?
[139:54.19]Wait, I don't have a house.
[139:57.51]Shit.
[139:59.33]What do I do?
[139:59.99]I need to live somewhere.
[140:03.15]I sold my house?
[140:09.10]I have to live at work now?
[140:10.24]Buy another condo.
[140:16.02]I need to live here.
[140:16.72]Buy another con- Okay, this is where I live.
[140:34.83]We got fired?
[140:37.28]I'm not going to be getting fired for organizing a union when I explicitly said that it was not what I was doing.
[140:41.82]All I want to do is make all of you think of yourselves as important stakeholders in the business instead of people who get paid to show up here.
[140:48.22]If all of us felt that way, imagine the things we could accomplish and the profits we might be entitled to.
[140:52.93]Far more profits than anyone in any kind of failed communist state would know anything about.
[140:57.47]I know that much.
[140:58.93]Sadly, you're all too foolish to see.
[141:00.37]You don't deserve me.
[141:01.01]Nobody deserves me.
[141:02.29]Fuck you.
[141:02.73]Fuck you all.
[141:07.72]How many people work here still?
[141:08.86]Okay.
[141:12.67]It's just me and the human computer.
[141:16.69]What did you do today?
[141:18.27]Leave me alone.
[141:18.89]Working shitty uppers.
[141:20.75]Fuck.
[141:22.11]I want to know what you did today.
[141:22.97]10 million in your account.
[141:26.37]Down 1 million.
[141:27.55]Down $275,000 today.
[141:31.73]I wonder who's going to get the promotion to VP.
[141:39.50]Unionize your workplaces gave 10 community subs.
[141:41.90]I bet you're wondering how it could be that this place was drowning in TIC agents two days ago.
[141:48.69]And yet now everything is back to being exactly the way it was.
[141:51.99]Or you do too.
[142:18.86]Also, I missed 10 community subs from Onomos and Lenny the Person.
[142:23.80]Thanks both of you for your 10 subs.
[142:29.89]Wait, aren't these everyone that got fired?
[142:36.67]You resent them for trying to make everybody else look bad by doing it.
[142:39.77]Before long, you realize it makes sense, especially the cleaners, who tried to make it feel like it was all a dream.
[142:43.85]It also seems to be easy to impress everybody as a host when you've got a staff at your beck and call.
[142:49.30]The bartenders and waiters go out of their way to make it clear that this is your party in a way that makes you understand they've done this many times before.
[142:56.20]Everybody loves you and tells you this is the best party they've ever been to.
[143:00.96]Before long, everybody will be doing this and try to enjoy it.
[143:09.78]Blackout.
[143:17.44]You look so tense, lady.
[143:18.26]Maybe you should take some time off.
[143:19.38]I always like to say, spoil yourself.
[143:21.38]You deserve it.
[143:22.74]Taking a two-year backpacking sabbatical after college was the best thing I ever did.
[143:26.37]I learned so much about the world just by going to places and really letting myself be there.
[143:31.35]Come by sometime and I'll show you the pictures.
[143:37.03]I know how boring it can seem, but dividends work.
[143:40.13]It can't be rip and run, buy and sell bullshit all the time.
[143:43.69]Makes sense now and then to check in for the long haul when you're dealing with things that will never change.
[143:48.71]Yesterday, you fucked up.
[143:50.23]You should have taken the dividends and respected the play.
[143:53.32]You're watching the news, right?
[143:54.22]I'm sure you can figure out that this is bigger than either of us now.
[143:56.72]When you eat shit like this, you make it seem like you can't see the bigger picture.
[144:00.90]Start seeing it.
[144:02.69]What's wrong with this person?
[144:04.25]Like how about like I do make my own trades and you like look I'm what if I want to buy like Starnux I'm just gonna buy it like what the who cares They leave me alone Tea drink tea
[144:22.15]What?
[144:22.27]What'd I get?
[144:22.97]Long.
[144:23.09]I'm long on this one.
[144:50.53]I believe there's a defender that... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:52.33]Hold on, wait.
[144:53.59]Dominion and the Free State Union.
[144:54.77]Dominion and the Free State Union?
[144:55.63]Who's got this shit?
[144:58.53]Darnucks, going up.
[145:02.65]We also got, um... Logging Company, going up.
[145:05.51]Okay, alright, alright.
[145:09.21]We got... Big stake here.
[145:12.88]Make $200,000 on the Free State Union related markets.
[145:15.46]Well, what the fuck?
[145:21.02]Southern Soda.
[145:25.32]Alright, coffee.
[145:25.94]Weapons are going down.
[145:26.66]Hey, hey, hey.
[145:32.47]Greetings from the Exorcist.
[145:33.49]We follow the money.
[145:34.23]All of your secrets belong to us.
[145:35.41]Justice for Balkidor.
[145:36.41]Fuck yourself and die.
[145:37.35]What happened?
[145:40.33]Somebody's laughing.
[145:42.03]Oh, this is just happening to everybody?
[145:43.09]My mouse isn't working.
[145:48.76]What the fuck is going on?
[145:52.79]Are you guys seeing this shit?
[145:54.87]Um... Somebody call the IT guy.
[146:00.38]Don't be alarmed by everything going on.
[146:01.66]The situation will be under control shortly.
[146:04.10]There's nothing about these degenerate criminals that is worth paying attention to.
[146:09.23]This is hacktivism nonsense.
[146:10.77]It's nothing but extortion.
[146:11.93]We received the ransom note moments after all this started happening.
[146:14.53]The IT department will figure it out.
[146:17.58]It becomes the most pragmatic course of action we will pay.
[146:20.68]After all, we can always find the money in the salaries of the IT employees who will be catapulted into the fucking moon if they do not fix this right now.
[146:28.96]Everybody shut the fuck up.
[146:29.66]Somebody call IT.
[146:30.80]I apologize for losing my temper.
[146:31.90]I truly loathe these disgusting nerd hacker people.
[146:35.46]They want the same thing we want.
[146:36.50]They just don't want to work for it.
[146:37.68]Goodbye.
[146:40.37]I'm up on a lot of stuff.
[146:41.15]Hold on.
[146:45.38]New Moneyville extraction.
[146:47.00]What if I close this trade?
[146:47.98]Are they gonna get it?
[146:48.56]Am I making money?
[147:06.34]Alright, I got $28,000 today.
[147:07.24]Alright, I need to make $200,000 on the Freestyle Union.
[147:12.94]What did Freestyle Union do?
[147:15.43]Products.
[147:19.21]I don't know.
[147:19.63]What's that?
[147:25.91]I don't know what that is, but it's going up.
[147:37.40]I don't think it's the right country.
[147:44.06]Keep going.
[147:45.68]I need to make $200,000 from that place.
[147:52.25]Free state union.
[147:53.15]I need free state union stocks.
[148:00.71]I don't know.
[148:01.23]I don't know what country these are.
[148:04.59]Mania's going up.
[148:05.19]By bullshit, I'm telling you.
[148:14.03]Keep going.
[148:22.20]By nature.
[148:24.96]Oh, I don't know.
[148:25.46]Keep going.
[148:29.94]At 100k, I'm going to...
[148:40.14]That's a pretty big haul right there.
[148:41.56]That's $100,000.
[148:42.04]Can we please play Nickelodeon Baseball again?
[148:46.90]The fact that you just said that infuriated me.
[148:51.68]That's a good trade.
[148:52.42]That's $100,000.
[148:52.65]Oh my god, yeah.
[148:55.19]Oh my goodness.
[148:55.81]$150,000.
[148:58.87]More.
[148:59.05]Let's go.
[148:59.37]$160,000.
[148:59.39]$200,000.
[148:59.43]Let's go $200,000.
[149:00.63]Let's go $200,000.
[149:00.99]Why not? $200,000.
[149:08.03]Oh!
[149:09.73]Over 200.
[149:10.31]Why not?
[149:15.11]And I am out in three.
[149:17.73]No, I'm not.
[149:18.17]Stay.
[149:20.47]Holy shit.
[149:22.96]It just doesn't stop.
[149:24.74]Oh my god.
[149:26.28]It's not stopping.
[149:31.84]I think it's time to sell now.
[149:33.02]I mean, no, not yet.
[149:34.62]What the fuck? 300,000?
[149:42.63]I guess I'm gonna... I'm gonna keep holding this until 500,000?
[149:46.87]I don't... I don't even know what stock this is.
[150:02.61]Wait till it dips by 20,000?
[150:03.39]That's a good idea.
[150:04.83]Alright, I'm getting out if this hits 350.
[150:09.21]I gotta put a new floor for myself.
[150:10.35]Okay, 375.
[150:11.05]No.
[150:12.59]The new floor is 400.
[150:13.21]400 is the new floor.
[150:18.66]The new floor is now 450.
[150:22.70]The new floor is now 475.
[150:23.28]Get out.
[150:40.27]Alright, I got 1.5 million dollars.
[150:42.93]Losing money on this dividend.
[150:47.05]It's okay.
[150:47.45]Alright.
[150:47.89]That was a huge amount of money.
[150:49.37]Thirst?
[150:52.21]Whatever this is, it's going down apparently.
[150:55.36]Oh, it's the ruble.
[150:56.12]Is that... I don't know what that is, but it's going down apparently.
[151:02.36]Whatever it is, it's going down.
[151:08.12]I know the daily challenge.
[151:09.14]New Moneyville.
[151:13.29]Okay, sickness.
[151:14.99]Murder.
[151:15.35]Okay, I'm gonna go long on murder.
[151:18.85]Alright, I'm gonna send.
[151:36.47]Lobbyists to this.
[151:37.61]I'm gonna go on.
[151:40.88]And go for a fucking million dollar trade.
[151:42.72]Go on.
[151:43.02]Come on.
[151:43.22]I got a million dollars in this.
[151:53.00]Lobbying Larry.
[151:53.91]I did one lobby.
[152:04.17]Come on.
[152:04.45]I need to get this guy to get to 200,000.
[152:05.31]Let's go.
[152:13.25]One more lobby.
[152:14.71]Should I do one more lobby?
[152:15.71]I think I'm going to do one more.
[152:16.57]Maybe not.
[152:17.45]I guess it's 200,000.
[152:18.45]Just a little bit more lobbying and that's it.
[152:25.77]Just one more lobby.
[152:27.93]No, I might not have to.
[152:28.61]200,000.
[152:28.63]Come on.
[152:28.79]200,000.
[152:28.81]200,000 and I'll get the daily challenge.
[152:31.97]Come on.
[152:32.29]Come on.
[152:32.59]Come on.
[152:32.77]More.
[152:32.89]Yes.
[152:33.09]Sell it.
[152:43.72]Yeah!
[152:48.08]Crack my knuckles.
[152:48.80]That was a pretty good day.
[152:50.00]I think that was a pretty good day.
[152:58.06]Drink some coffee.
[152:58.68]I'm done.
[152:59.02]I don't need to trade anything else.
[153:00.00]I'm done.
[153:00.34]What do I need to do?
[153:11.27]All in a day's work.
[153:23.79]All right.
[153:27.41]Market's closed in a few minutes.
[153:39.00]Prison.
[153:39.42]Okay.
[153:39.54]How are my dividends doing? $31,000?
[153:49.71]Going to coffee at 5 p.m.
[153:51.47]Uh, no.
[153:54.27]That was a really good day.
[153:55.87]Oh, this guy.
[153:56.49]It's over.
[153:57.08]I beat this guy.
[153:58.92]He doesn't even have a chance.
[153:59.84]I just have to make a little tiny little trade tomorrow.
[154:02.68]And I win.
[154:03.62]And I'm vice president of the company.
[154:07.88]Look at this money just rolling in on my personal account.
[154:27.33]I tried using one of those gig services that manages all your other gig services.
[154:30.19]All it did was fuck everything up, I swear to God.
[154:33.33]Good trading day today.
[154:34.11]Hey, good trades.
[154:35.55]Good trade, team!
[154:36.63]Good trades!
[154:37.51]All around.
[154:43.38]You gained more from a landlord than you did from work.
[154:47.78]I did?
[154:49.26]Well, it's because there's like three sports cars in the driveway.
[154:52.58]You're not even renting the house at that point.
[154:53.92]You're renting the cars.
[155:08.69]Looks like Ferris is having some trouble with cyber security.
[155:10.74]Nobody called us to investigate, but a hack that massive attracts attention regardless.
[155:16.20]Seems like your people are getting it under control, but I'm sure it makes you think about things.
[155:19.32]A bunch of teenagers in the middle of nowhere can hit Ferris like this.
[155:23.27]Maybe you're not as untouchable as you think you are.
[155:27.15]I'm letting everybody know they can reach out to the Trade and Investment Commission anytime they like.
[155:32.15]We're always looking for people who are as good at predicting their own futures as they are predicting the markets.
[155:37.57]See you around.
[155:38.76]You want to be a plant?
[155:40.28]Informant?
[155:46.59]I know it looks sad today, but don't worry.
[155:47.74]I'm through the worst of it.
[155:49.50]I was just thinking about how much suffering there is in the world.
[155:52.20]Like, have you ever heard about all the sad stuff going on in the Volcador?
[155:54.68]It's so sad.
[155:56.10]Why does one tiny little group of sad poor people have to go through every bad thing that could possibly happen?
[156:00.82]I'm just thankful that so many people from places like here are trying to, like, set up businesses there so they can have better jobs.
[156:07.44]I read a quote once about how people will forget what you do, but remember how you made them feel.
[156:11.90]So hopefully they feel better soon.
[156:16.92]Yeah, that's, that's a good, yeah, that's true.
[156:21.94]Me too.
[156:22.46]I hope they do, I hope they do better.
[156:23.54]How come stuff's all over my screen?
[156:29.23]Employee business, what's that?
[156:31.91]P. P.
[156:51.70]What's going on with my thing?
[156:53.38]Another thing I forgot to say.
[156:56.58]Can you believe how bad we got hacked?
[156:58.73]The whole system's all messed up.
[156:59.95]They're saying they got deep into the database or something.
[157:02.63]Apparently things will be screwed up like this for days.
[157:06.26]I'll mention this, but some junior analyst asked Corbin about it, and he fired them on the spot.
[157:10.56]This is the most emotional I've ever seen him.
[157:13.23]If you see him, just pretend like everything's fine, and that none of this terrible shit's even happening to us.
[157:16.45]It's seriously, like, the worst thing that's ever happened in my life.
[157:19.99]So, everywhere.
[157:21.81]I think that's why it bothers everybody so much.
[157:23.37]You know what?
[157:23.83]More people here need to be in therapy.
[157:25.80]In the meantime, try to enjoy yourself.
[157:27.00]Remember that the only damage left is superficial.
[157:28.98]Good vibes, okay?
[157:29.54]Have a great day.
[157:31.00]Alright.
[157:33.74]Okay.
[157:34.52]What's going on here?
[157:39.86]Is it over for iron still?
[157:41.36]Stock falls as recycled alternatives arise.
[157:43.58]Iron.
[157:44.00]Short iron.
[157:44.40]I don't even know what iron is.
[157:49.17]This is gaining some traction here.
[157:53.53]This is gaining traction.
[158:02.05]I just need 20 grand.
[158:05.16]I need 20 grand and I'm going to go drink coffee.
[158:11.20]Get it up there.
[158:11.60]Let's go.
[158:11.92]13.
[158:21.15]16.
[158:21.17]14.
[158:21.31]Come on.
[158:24.22]22.
[158:24.24]There it is.
[158:27.48]29.
[158:28.40]34.
[158:28.58]38.
[158:30.84]I have secured myself as vice president of the company.
[158:38.77]Now I'm just gonna go drink coffee and let the day go by.
[158:44.71]Let the day go by.
[158:45.35]I don't need to do anything else.
[158:46.29]I am now vice president.
[158:49.29]What is this?
[158:50.91]Flyer?
[158:53.33]Employee business club.
[158:54.29]Not a union.
[158:54.89]Strictly for discussions on how we can make the company more successful.
[159:00.39]Whose is this?
[159:01.85]Alright, let's drink some coffee.
[159:17.12]Landed on somebody else's desk to get them fired.
[159:19.08]Why would I do that?
[159:19.80]Alright, time for the day to blow by.
[159:25.32]Oh, Jesus.
[159:38.83]How's my dividends doing?
[159:43.16]Get sickness price 10% lower.
[159:44.94]I didn't even do anything.
[159:45.76]It just happened.

[160:25.34]Am I gonna get fired for that?

[160:35.05]What?
[160:35.37]On the boss's desk?
[160:38.73]Just go and be like, this is what we're up to, boss.
[160:41.47]The fuck are you gonna do about it?
[160:45.81]Oh shit, my phone.
[160:55.74]Boss will have to fire himself.
[161:01.79]I'm just wasting time.
[161:04.25]I've already made my traits for the day.
[161:06.03]I don't need to do anything else.
[161:07.59]What do I need to do?
[161:17.66]And he's called me a scab.
[161:19.78]Buy coffee.
[161:22.10]Dark roast coffee?
[161:23.06]Let's go long on it.
[161:23.88]A million bucks.
[161:25.32]Into tomorrow.
[161:32.52]Million bucks into tomorrow.
[161:36.78]Gonna hold it till tomorrow.
[161:41.58]Market's closed.
[161:43.60]And now I am the vice president of the company.
[161:51.94]No problems.
[161:52.52]Nothing.
[161:52.78]I'm good.
[161:53.81]Wait.
[161:55.59]This is statistically impossible.
[161:57.93]I don't care what they had access to.
[161:59.23]There was no way they should have been able to match my thought process, my models, my automations.
[162:02.51]Let me look at the data.
[162:04.78]I can't do that.
[162:05.40]Your security clearance has been revoked and all your passwords have been changed.
[162:09.46]You're making a mistake.
[162:10.06]Just give me a few minutes in the system to figure it out.
[162:11.96]I can... Your medical insurance will expire in several weeks.
[162:16.31]I wonder if you might want to seek attention to what condition or unprescribed treatment might be causing this level of paranoia.
[162:21.73]I'm not paranoid.
[162:23.19]It's not anxiety.
[162:23.79]It's just that it's not the drug.
[162:24.87]This is not my mind.
[162:25.63]This is... It's not... This is the stock market, Mrs. Walker.
[162:28.61]Sometimes people get lucky.
[162:29.65]Sometimes they're just better than you are.
[162:30.97]No fucking way.
[162:34.11]Please leave the building calmly.
[162:35.21]If you don't, I'll have the director of security to search you closely and report anything you'd be carrying to law enforcement.
[162:41.21]This is awful.
[162:49.20]I'm gonna buy another house.
[163:18.45]I'm gonna sell this condo.
[163:19.45]I'm gonna buy a house.
[163:20.71]No, I need cars.
[163:21.35]Can I get a house and then just sell and lease it?
[163:36.00]I need cars.
[163:37.38]Alright, I'm gonna buy a house tomorrow.
[163:41.14]Only CEOs work at the company.
[163:42.82]I need to make five million dollars.
[163:45.40]Okay.
[163:46.70]I'm in the end game here.
[163:47.54]I have to make five million dollars.
[163:54.09]I gotta drink some tea to calm me down here.
[164:03.23]Okay, is that- are we back to normal?
[164:11.92]Managing director and then fuck the company.
[164:14.91]But we'll see what happens.
[164:15.57]Because I'm going to make an insane play tomorrow.
[164:18.85]And I'm going to make 5 million dollars.
[164:20.89]Tomorrow.
[164:24.56]I'm going to send in the lobbyists.
[164:26.70]I'm going to have the lobbyists send it down.
[164:29.22]I'm going to buy in at the bottom.
[164:30.56]Like 2 million bucks.
[164:31.58]And then I'm going to send the lobbyists to go up.
[164:40.00]Oh, you versus Ward.
[164:41.07]What an exciting showdown.
[164:43.15]Obviously, I'm on your side.
[164:44.17]Don't tell her I said this, but I've always thought Ward was such a snake.
[164:47.79]She's such a try-hard.
[164:49.49]She thinks she's so edgy.
[164:50.63]If you got rid of her, you'd be giving a gift to the universe.
[164:54.34]Don't hold back.
[164:55.52]Oh, that's right.
[164:55.98]Coffee.
[164:56.32]I do have coffee.
[164:56.88]You're right.
[165:00.32]So, it all comes down to this.
[165:01.70]Never thought it would be you and me competing for managing director.
[165:06.29]I mean, I knew it would be me and somebody else, but not you.
[165:10.44]Sort of makes me regret everything I've ever done to help you.
[165:13.09]But I'm also a sucker for poetic justice.
[165:15.41]The question is, which one of us is going to be on the receiving end of it?
[165:18.63]Good luck, pal.
[165:19.89]The hopeful news today is it seems the Civil War in Bacador may finally be reaching an end.
[165:33.37]Revolent government forces are both severely weakened by conflict.
[165:37.90]Get out of that dividend.
[165:40.68]And I was left an estimated 57,000 people.
[165:42.56]Oh my god.
[165:46.95]Talks.
[165:47.87]Preparing for talks.
[165:49.65]Get out of this.
[165:50.69]Sell it.
[165:52.89]Coffee.
[165:55.37]I got 3.6 million dollars.
[165:58.83]This is a Balkan and company.
[166:01.41]Ready for this shit?
[166:02.39]Are you ready for this shit?
[166:03.31]Are you guys ready?
[166:05.99]Check this out.
[166:08.80]2.5 million bucks in coffee.
[166:11.22]3 million bucks in coffee.
[166:16.85]Let's go.
[166:25.17]Send in.
[166:26.35]I need to make $250,000.
[166:26.73]I'll do that in my sleep.
[166:27.37]Let's go.
[166:31.31]Hello?
[166:32.47]Since this is probably going to be the end of our friendship, I thought we might as well go out with a bang.
[166:36.85]What are you talking about?
[166:37.51]I made some calls, spent a few bucks, and as of this morning, the two of us are untouchable.
[166:41.81]Until one of us wins this thing, the PR harpies are on unlimited retainers, and the hall monitors at TIC are looking the other way.
[166:49.44]No matter what you do, the public opinion meter won't matter, and you can break all the rules you want.
[166:53.72]We're living in the good old days all over again, pal.
[166:56.60]Had a two-hour head start, but you wouldn't believe the sex act I had toberger.
[166:59.50]What?! !
[167:00.68]Later.
[167:03.16]Send... Send in everybody into coffee.
[167:09.16]No, no, no.
[167:09.50]Hurry.
[167:10.08]Hurry.
[167:10.36]You just threw me off.
[167:11.64]You just threw me off so bad.
[167:13.37]Where's my stocks?
[167:18.45]Lobby.
[167:20.89]Lobby.
[167:21.29]Why can't I lobby?
[167:23.83]What the fuck?
[167:24.27]I can't lobby.
[167:29.73]I got 4.6 million.
[167:30.73]I can't lobby.
[167:32.93]Now I can.
[167:33.55]What the hell?
[167:35.10]Going back in coffee.
[167:40.66]2.5 million.
[167:45.29]Million.
[167:48.27]Lobby.
[167:49.95]Eat shit, lady.
[167:54.41]I got 5 million bucks in this company.
[167:55.87]Let's go.
[168:00.08]Why did you believe her?

[173:30.17]I'm down half a million, but I'm going to get $730,000 for this.
[173:35.11]It's too late.

[174:45.55]How the fuck did you lose money?
[174:47.79]Wait, hold on.
[174:48.89]She wasn't lying?
[174:52.56]How did we both lose money?
[174:53.88]Did we both get scared?
[174:56.88]She wasn't lying.
[174:58.56]So then she got into my head.
[175:00.04]I thought she was lying, but then she realized that she maybe, maybe she had it wrong and she lost a bunch of money too.
[175:12.65]Alright.
[175:13.47]Well, okay.
[175:15.17]I'm going to buy another house.
[175:23.76]And then I'm not going to rent this.
[175:25.24]I'm going to wait until I have some cars.
[175:29.82]I can't believe that she was... I thought she was lying.
[175:35.49]Lease this one for $41,000 a day.

[175:58.70]And you guys told me that she was lying, and then I... Well, now what happens tomorrow?
[176:03.86]I think I was supposed to win right there.
[176:11.34]What do you have to do to make everything legal for a day?
[176:13.44]How could that even be real?
[176:22.29]Well, I guess we don't have those.
[176:24.75]People are walking around today like they've seen a ghost.
[176:27.37]Whatever it is, remember that a positive attitude is the key to success.
[176:29.66]I've been watching a lot of overseas pop music videos.
[176:31.90]You can do it, senpai.
[176:33.86]Thank you.
[176:36.10]Alright, we've got news coming in.
[176:42.43]Accusations thrown today after a failed coup in the Democratic Republic of Balcador.
[176:47.63]Elected officials in the Balcordorian Congress claim that agencies from the Free State Union were behind a violent coup attempt on the eve of a peaceful agreement.
[176:54.29]War.
[176:54.65]Back on the menu.
[176:58.55]Reporters for the FCO are denying the accusation claiming to know nothing.

[177:41.81]I'm calling to either congratulate you or commiserate over how fucked we are.
[177:46.67]Based on the silence, I'm guessing this isn't you successfully getting me kicked off of Geissnet.
[177:52.18]It's down for both of us, isn't it?
[177:53.38]Hell, probably down for everyone.
[177:55.28]The fucking exorcists.
[177:56.96]The EXC exorcists again, probably.
[177:59.26]No respect, these guys.
[178:00.18]Don't they know that you and me are in the middle of a dramatic race to the top?

[187:37.26]I'm sure you all thought it was hacktivism, but no, I'm afraid it was us.
[187:40.14]We did enjoy watching all of you flay around without it, though.
[187:43.54]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[187:47.75]Geist net.
[187:48.29]Geist net.
[187:49.15]I've heard the kids talking about that.
[187:50.48]I'm too old for that shit.
[187:53.12]You're under arrest for an insane number of crimes.
[187:56.18]Most of which you committed brazenly in the past few days.
[187:58.16]In fact, what the hell were you thinking?
[188:00.14]Now tell me somebody in one of your foolish little contests tricked you into thinking you were covered.
[188:03.48]That's the problem with you people.
[188:05.20]You think everything is a game and you've never lost anything for real.
[188:08.70]We've got something else to discuss.
[188:09.78]Something in the big, bigger picture.
[188:12.26]Shall we go?
[188:16.91]Digital testimony.
[188:17.83]Hold on.
[188:44.77]These terms will be applied fully and affect your usage of legal.
[188:47.01]By using legal, you agree to accept.
[188:48.76]By digitally signing these terms, you swear to use legal only to testify before any court in any jurisdiction truthfully.
[188:54.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[188:57.90]Restrictions, publishing, legal, whatever.
[188:59.76]All right.
[189:02.66]Ten minutes from now, you're going to be called to testify in your own defense.
[189:06.08]I'm here to tell you the obvious.
[189:07.16]You don't have a defense.
[189:09.12]Various lawyers don't have a defense.
[189:10.98]Jesus Christ does not have a defense.
[189:12.56]Not for you.
[189:14.19]And you're a big enough fish to fry.
[189:15.63]If you don't want to work with us, we can live with that.
[189:18.11]Personally, there's nothing I would rather see than you in prison for the rest of your life.
[189:22.76]are people who deserve to go down even more than you do and you know exactly who I'm talking about the millers the family office the names beneath the name the more you make the closer to them you get it's the only way to reach people like that and you're already off to a good start you can walk out of here today and go back to ferrios like none of this ever happened the state will fake your trial I'll do my best to get the agency to deal with your fine and you become a confidential informant to the trade investment commission
[189:51.95]This is not a negotiation.
[189:53.58]You can help us take them down, or you can take the fall yourself.
[189:56.04]What'll it be?
[190:05.28]Is this a test?
[190:08.57]Yeah, what if this is a paid actor from the company?
[190:13.65]It's very possible this could be a paid actor.
[190:15.45]And this is a test.
[190:19.13]That guy seems pretty eccentric and weird, doesn't he?
[190:30.20]No deal.
[190:31.96]Snitches.
[190:33.44]This is a test.
[190:34.71]No, yeah, I think this is a test.
[190:39.49]You can trust him.
[190:40.13]He has a fat ass.
[190:46.65]Do you want to?
[190:47.24]I don't know.
[190:47.76]I feel like this is a trick somehow.
[190:49.22]I'm going to say no.
[190:58.38]I understand.
[190:58.70]You think the family can save you from all this?
[191:00.92]That even the government trying to take you out ultimately worked for them too, just like anyone?
[191:05.77]But ask yourself this.
[191:07.41]If they're really all so, so powerful, do you think they'll give a second thought to sacrificing you the moment that you become an inconvenience?
[191:15.57]Do you think they got to where they are by rewarding loyalty, even when it hurts?
[191:20.73]Well, I guess it's all rhetorical at this point.
[191:23.50]I guess you're going to find out.
[191:30.36]I made so much money for you.
[191:31.82]I made so much money!
[191:33.04]Before court resumes, I would like to apologize to the jury for the substantial delays involved in this case.
[191:39.97]Numerous motions filed by counsel on both sides have created unnecessary hindrances, and this court has already had to give several citations for contempt.
[191:49.14]Let me be clear.
[191:50.56]Any further attempts to administratively obstruct justice in these proceedings will result in prison and disbarment.
[191:56.98]Am I understood?
[191:59.64]Yes, Your Honor.
[192:01.68]Yes, Your Honor.
[192:03.18]Good.
[192:03.86]Because of the media attention surrounding these events, it has been necessary to sequester our new jury for several months.
[192:11.17]However, we are now prepared to proceed.
[192:12.73]The prosecution has called the Vice President of Ferrio's Capital Management to testify.
[192:19.09]Average Head PhD just gave 50 community subs.
[192:21.35]Holy shit.
[192:23.42]Thanks for the 50 subs.
[192:25.32]Sub City, that's right.
[192:28.00]Thanks a lot.
[192:28.54]That's a lot of money.
[192:31.02]Thank you, Your Honor.
[192:33.92]Oh, community subs.
[192:35.76]As the defendant, you've been called to testify a result of the overwhelming evidence against you.
[192:39.30]Over the past several months, you've made substantial use of a dark web communication tool known as Geisnet.
[192:46.65]This is where I do, like, move my arms around and, like, put my eyes rolled in the back of my head.
[192:49.87]I don't... What is that?
[192:54.86]Through this tool, you were able to gain access to privileged information that enabled you to act on a legal foreknowledge of the movement of several markets.
[193:00.72]Do you admit to it?
[193:04.56]Your Honor, that sounds like a Mega Man.
[193:06.24]That sounds like a map in Mega Man.
[193:15.86]This tool, you're able to gain access to privileged information that... Of course I don't admit it.
[193:22.71]No, maybe once I looked over the shoulder of somebody that was doing it.
[193:27.41]No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
[193:31.02]Because of the use of insider information, fair competition in the coffee market was destabilized.
[193:37.84]Do you understand?
[193:38.52]You were responsible for this.
[193:41.98]Fair competition in the coffee market?
[193:46.82]I was not responsible for this.
[193:48.22]What are you talking about?
[193:53.03]You callously reaped tremendous profits from the crash of the global gas and electric market.
[193:58.09]A crash that left thousands of people in developing countries that produced it unable to care for their families.
[194:02.42]Do you deny this?
[194:06.16]No, I didn't do this.
[194:07.22]Wait, no, wait, wait, wait.
[194:08.06]I don't want to answer this wrong.
[194:14.88]Do you deny this?
[194:16.62]I invoke my right to not respond on the advice of counsel that I may incriminate myself.
[194:20.00]What does that mean?
[194:20.58]That means I did it.
[194:22.16]I deny this, yes.
[194:25.54]Leading the Fifth just means, yes, I did it, in a different sentence.
[194:29.78]Most significantly, the cascade of all these actions resulted in nothing less than a civil war within the Democratic Republic of Balcador.
[194:35.60]Do you realize that you did this for your own personal gain?
[194:42.46]Is this the part of the movie where I go, Yes, yes, it was!
[194:47.15]And I saw it like my head starts spinning around.
[194:49.99]I did it and I could have gotten away with it too.
[194:52.74]But this little legal counsel had to get... And I have a fucking big black cape on.
[194:57.88]Like a big top hat.
[194:58.70]Like, no, I'm going to deny it.
[195:03.10]Do you realize that you did all this for your own personal gain and nothing else?
[195:06.71]No.
[195:10.39]Objection, Your Honor.
[195:11.39]None of us are here to moralize on the social outcome of a free market.
[195:15.13]These events could have taken place regardless of whether or not they invested on behalf of the firm as they did.
[195:20.74]Objection is sustained.
[195:21.76]Counselor will limit themselves to matters concerning the specific legalities which occurred.
[195:27.30]With pleasure, Your Honor.
[195:29.20]As I mentioned, we have overwhelming evidence of insider trading through Geisnet.
[195:33.06]I mention the implications only to demonstrate a complete lack of remorse on the part of the defendant.
[195:38.74]The evidence proves nothing about their state of mind.
[195:42.96]This employee was offered the opportunity to cooperate with the government to make amends for their crimes and refused.
[195:48.75]This person is a financial professional performing a task on behalf of an employer.
[195:52.99]No more responsible or directly connected to the state of the world than the rest of us.
[195:57.97]Enough!
[195:59.39]I will not have this trial devolve into the kind of circus that led up to it.
[196:03.23]Again, this court will limit itself to the rule of law.
[196:06.05]the impact can be considered if and when the client has been found guilty.
[196:11.26]Well, they won't be.
[196:11.92]The verdict.
[196:18.28]You've been found guilty.
[196:22.93]Of all charges, please know that the jury... Wait, did he just turn and say that to me?
[196:27.75]Please know that the jury required 15 minutes to reach this verdict.
[196:32.51]However, given the scope of restitution that could be made, this court has determined you will be punished via financial penalty rather than incarceration.
[196:41.35]I hereby impose a fine of $1,000,000 payable immediately?
[196:45.07]Holy shit, that's awesome!
[196:48.74]I have $10,000,000 in the bank!
[196:52.26]Your Honor, I wish to have it noted that a penalty of this amount implies the expectation that Ferrios will accept liability on behalf of the employee.
[197:00.96]and due to substantial liquidity problems at the moment I'm afraid that ferrios will not be able to undertake this responsibility the employee will be forced to pay the full amount from their personal account is that is that it can I go can I get back to the desk your honor according to our evidence the defendant is perfectly capable of making this payment from their personal account
[197:27.08]But your Honor, think of how little this will leave them to begin the long and hard process of rehabilitating their character.
[197:33.64]Unfortunately, it seems that a substantial portion of the funds are overseas, held in shell companies, or otherwise difficult to access.
[197:41.89]Fine.
[197:43.19]I will put the matter to the defendant directly.
[197:45.55]Are you prepared to cooperate with this court to retrieve the payment required?
[197:48.59]What did I say?
[197:51.19]No.
[197:53.61]Nope.
[197:54.81]I am not.
[197:55.37]I am not prepared.
[197:57.54]Yes.
[198:00.46]Take the million.
[198:01.58]The matter is settled then.
[198:02.42]The client will pay the amount ordered and be released presently.
[198:04.74]This court is dismissed.
[198:09.52]I'm good.
[198:12.26]I have like 4.8 million dollars in my account.
[198:15.98]You're still a millionaire.
[198:20.07]They cracked you good, huh?
[198:21.51]You just lost more money than most people ever imagined.
[198:24.61]Well, you know what they say, easy come, easy go.
[198:26.21]With everything you've done, I'm sure you can get back there.
[198:28.09]The worst is past us.
[198:30.07]So what do you say?
[198:30.53]You want to come back to Ferio's?
[198:31.63]Tomorrow's a new day, no time like the present.
[198:35.31]Yes, I want to stay at Ferio's.
[198:39.61]And I'm coming for you, motherfucker.
[198:42.04]Oh, you thought this big song and dance here, you thought you were going to get me?
[198:45.36]You thought you were going to get rid of me?
[198:47.65]As I remember, I was up $4 million to your measly $170,000.
[198:53.21]And look where I am now.
[198:55.61]And I'll be back to the fucking office tomorrow.
[198:58.15]And your ass is gone.
[198:59.55]You hear me?
[199:00.07]You'll never get rid of me.
[199:02.35]Doesn't matter what you do.
[199:03.41]I will always win.
[199:06.48]Goodbye.
[199:07.08]See you tomorrow.
[199:08.74]You think I was going to take this?
[199:09.96]You think this was going to shut me down?
[199:12.06]See you tomorrow.
[199:18.59]Yeah, we'll see you there.
[199:19.41]What happened?
[199:29.98]On behalf of the company, I want to thank you for doing the right thing.
[199:33.14]With the amount of scrutiny that Ferios is presently under, we are unable to render any kind of payment which might be misinterpreted as compensating you for paying the fine.
[199:40.79]However, please know that your loyalty and discretion in this matter has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated.
[199:46.43]If time is right, you'll be rewarded handsomely for what you've done.
[199:49.41]On a completely unrelated note, please send me a list of jurisdictions outside of the free state of Uruk Dominion where you think you might enjoy permanent residency.
[199:57.11]Most of them really aren't that bad.
[200:00.13]Not if you have the requisite amount of armed security, servants, and whatnot.
[200:04.25]If you think about it, things here will probably be equally bad before too much longer, and they've got better beaches.
[200:09.88]Anyways, give it some thought.
[200:11.26]Goodbye.
[200:22.89]Back in that fucking office.
[200:24.85]I look sad today, but don't worry.
[200:25.77]I'm through the worst of it.
[200:26.51]I'm just thinking about how much suffering there is in the world.
[200:29.07]Like, have you ever heard about the stuff going on the bot- Wait, I already- Can we already do this?
[200:35.12]Wait, we don't have an open trade in the coffee company?
[200:46.11]I got- What do I got?
[200:48.31]I got 7.4 million dollars!
[200:53.45]You're lost.
[200:57.94]7.5 million.
[200:58.20]Let's go.
[200:58.50]Let's go.
[200:58.82]Let's go.
[200:59.20]Back in the saddle.
[200:59.88]Back in it.
[201:00.26]Back in it.
[201:00.58]Back in it.
[201:00.88]Smartphones are on the rise.
[201:01.78]Smartphones.
[201:02.34]Lobby.
[201:02.78]Just do the lobbies again.
[201:03.66]I forgot to buy.
[201:06.86]I forgot to buy.
[201:07.48]I forgot to buy.
[201:08.06]I forgot to buy.
[201:09.23]I forgot to buy.
[201:09.93]I've been out of the office for too long.
[201:29.57]Same mistakes.
[201:30.55]Alright, that's half a million.
[201:37.63]Oh, shit.
[201:38.17]Let's go.
[201:38.57]Uno eats.
[201:45.77]Oh, my God.
[201:46.56]This is going to be the first million dollar trade.
[201:50.64]Keep going.
[201:51.04]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[201:52.70]Big money, big money.
[201:53.36]Sell it.
[201:58.68]Starbucks going up!
[201:59.06]Smartphones down!

[202:28.76]Actual psycho.
[202:34.40]Prison speedrun.
[202:37.81]Oh, okay.
[202:38.31]I got to relax.
[202:42.35]Does it feel good?
[202:43.29]No, it feels awful.
[202:52.77]Oh, come on.
[202:53.25]Look, it's still going.
[203:03.66]I gotta trade on a catalyst.
[203:04.80]Next catalyst I'm going all in.
[203:05.92]Looks like it's... smartphones took a dive.
[203:12.46]They bounced back immediately though.
[203:17.24]I'll get tea.
[203:17.86]Nah, I don't need tea.
[203:21.81]Lobbying is not illegal.
[203:26.75]Using the... this Geist net is.
[203:32.86]Alright, next catalyst.
[203:33.64]Let's go.
[203:38.42]It should be.
[203:38.92]Hey, what a fucking weird ass world we live in.
[203:44.04]Wait, FSU.
[203:44.80]Soda.
[203:45.90]Mobile.
[203:46.32]Mobile.
[203:46.76]Mobile.
[203:47.22]Mobiles.
[203:47.82]Mobile phones.
[203:56.33]Let's go.
[203:56.75]Mobile phones.
[203:57.29]Let's go.
[204:16.27]1 million in 1 million.
[204:18.77]It's going to go up to 2 million.
[204:19.66]1.3 million.
[204:22.60]1.4 million.
[204:22.86]1.5 million.
[204:23.16]1.6.
[204:23.38]Come on.
[204:24.04]2 million.
[204:24.38]That's good enough for me.
[204:44.93]Lobbying is just the weirdest thing to me.
[204:48.45]Why do we want outside companies to be able to go in and like be like weird like snakes in our representative's ears?
[204:55.76]Ah, yes.
[204:56.40]You see.
[204:57.34]You see the coal.
[204:58.54]Coal.
[204:58.78]You need to get involved with coal.
[205:00.00]Pass the legislation for coal.
[205:04.81]What did that say?
[205:05.21]Danger zone?
[205:05.69]Oh.
[205:08.43]Alright.
[205:12.79]I got one more trade to make.
[205:16.92]This could go down a little bit more.
[205:17.98]We can, you know, lobbyists.
[205:19.66]Go take care of that.
[205:21.30]Give me the bonus.
[205:22.53]I want that daily challenge.
[205:25.15]Coffee.
[205:35.02]Coffee going up.
[205:43.40]I think I got the... I think I'm going to win.
[205:45.38]I'm going to become the president of the company now.
[205:48.41]Even though I got the neutral ending or whatever the hell that was.
[205:53.59]Oh, that's going crazy.
[205:58.24]Somebody said smooth cigarettes.
[206:02.46]Smooth cigarettes.
[206:03.46]Are you talking about what?
[206:09.24]Why?
[206:13.72]Oh, this is going down.
[206:14.84]Down, down, down, down.
[206:17.27]Close this trade out for the day.
[206:18.53]I'll take 10 million in cash.
[206:25.33]Two cigar and one drag.
[206:32.28]They don't even cough.
[206:40.16]All right.
[206:41.05]Did I win?
[206:41.47]I got the daily challenge.
[206:43.99]Oh my god, it's been seven hours.
[206:44.95]Alright, I'm done.
[206:45.57]That was fun.
[206:48.71]I got really sucked into this game.
[206:50.35]This was a lot of fun.
[206:55.39]I'm so glad somebody made a game like this.
[206:57.92]Even though it's like, you know, it's a little wacky, right?
[206:59.78]I'm not buying anything else.
[207:02.42]I'm done for the day.
[207:02.88]Like, this is cool.
[207:08.30]This is exactly what I wanted.
[207:09.62]This is what I wanted for a video game.
[207:14.30]Like, why can't a company like this get, like, $50 million to make a full game about this?
[207:20.28]Rather than, like, a two to three hour experience.
[207:22.34]I want, like, a full market.
[207:25.72]And, yeah, I could just make, like, a paper trading account.
[207:28.40]But it's more fun when it's just fake video game shit.
[207:30.87]I just took a screenshot.
[207:38.47]Things don't stop being fucked up out there.
[207:39.81]I have no idea how I'm gonna hit...
[207:46.50]Okay.
[207:47.22]I only need 3.5 million more dollars to win the game.
[207:52.90]I get no money.
[207:54.16]They took it all from me.
[207:54.88]They literally took all my assets.
[207:56.52]Alright.
[208:01.41]One more trading day and I'm done.
[208:02.49]I'm not done yet.
[208:14.44]I can make 3 million dollars tomorrow.
[208:25.07]Greed is good.
[208:28.21]Greed is good.
[208:29.13]Have a bonus.
[208:29.71]I believe the scene that person made yesterday afternoon when they got let go.
[208:35.07]Some people act like their job is their whole life.
[208:37.51]If you're so unhappy with things, why don't find a new hobby?
[208:40.85]Love yourself first.
[208:47.14]Alright.
[208:47.56]Tea.
[208:47.90]I'm making the most Omega trade.
[208:58.84]It's time for an Omega trade.
[208:59.98]I have 10 million dollars.
[209:08.04]We're going to go to... What's a beaten down stock?
[209:12.24]Hello, it's Quinn Miller.
[209:13.40]Oh, another thing I forgot to say.
[209:14.44]Can you believe how bad we got hacked?
[209:15.92]The whole system is all messed up.
[209:20.17]Leave me alone.
[209:20.57]Alright, we're going for an Omega trade.
[209:27.71]Whatever is going to... Whatever is skyrocketing... You know what?
[209:32.31]I'm drinking the other tea.
[209:34.74]Because whatever gets skyrocketing, I'm going to throw lobbyists at it and put all my money in it.
[209:46.78]Okay, here we go.
[209:56.71]Whatever happens here, I'm doing 10 million bucks.
[210:02.38]Get it ready.
[210:04.94]We're going to look for something horrible, like a huge spike.
[210:11.96]And I'm going to jump on it.
[210:13.32]I'm going to dump every cent into it.
[210:15.10]Like, for instance, launches a new advertising campaign.
[210:17.98]Eh.
[210:19.86]Eh, it's not a big deal.
[210:26.99]I'm looking for the red one.
[210:29.88]I need to make three to four million dollars today and I get the next ending.
[210:37.56]Is this just free play?
[210:39.38]Um, I still have that screen showing me that how my progress to being the CEO.
[210:45.52]Okay, here we go.
[210:47.76]New safety standards for munitions industry workers escalate prices.
[210:50.56]Nah, no, it's not really a big deal.
[210:55.32]Innovation breakthrough in construction.
[210:56.52]Product cowardly surge in demand.
[210:57.86]What do you think?
[211:03.35]Am I going on this one and then just going crazy with lobbying?
[211:08.45]Start of war.
[211:10.96]No, no, nobody cares about this.
[211:12.12]Public finance crisis casts fear.
[211:27.61]We're going to short tabbouleh beef.
[211:28.77]This is it.
[211:36.47]This is the big one.
[211:45.86]This is the big one here.
[211:46.82]This is it. 700,000.
[211:56.31]This is a big problem here.
[211:58.11]Come on.
[211:58.55]One million.
[211:59.21]I need to get like a two to three million dollar trade.
[212:04.90]Lobby it.
[212:05.38]I just did.
[212:05.78]I already did.
[212:14.12]It sounds like half of the place is in... Oh!
[212:17.41]Get out.
[212:19.03]Buy me.
[212:35.64]State subsidies will be granted in the meat business.
[212:41.02]I was gonna say, these people in the background sound like the Resident Evil 4 villagers.
[212:48.11]Okay.
[212:49.39]That was at 1.2 million.
[213:02.09]I need like another big million plus dollar trade.
[213:06.78]I need a big catalyst.
[213:25.57]Come on.
[213:25.91]I just want to get to the CEO position and I'll be done.
[213:32.54]And then one of them goes... I don't even know what it says.
[213:36.64]I don't know what they say, but... Something like that.
[213:42.58]I love it.
[213:55.97]Instruction.
[213:56.35]Come on.
[213:56.55]Give me another catalyst.
[213:57.33]I want to make another million.
[214:05.65]Just sell him more money.
[214:10.02]I need to get another 1.5 million.
[214:12.44]Nothing else has to happen.
[214:20.55]Alright, I'm drinking coffee.
[214:21.33]Fuck it.
[214:45.24]Let's go.
[214:48.76]I'm not in a trade, am I?
[214:50.44]I hope not.
[214:51.96]No.
[214:53.70]Sienna.
[214:54.18]Sienna.
[214:55.21]Oh, I can't.
[214:56.63]I can't.
[214:57.25]I can't.
[214:57.59]Yes, I can.
[215:04.49]Keep going up.
[215:05.55]No, shit.
[215:09.58]Too fast.
[215:14.02]Produce, produce.
[215:15.34]Beverages, produce, go!
[215:20.40]Lobby, produce.
[215:35.93]Meat!
[215:36.89]Oh, that's gonna be- that's a sympathy play.
[215:38.49]That's a- produce is a sympathy play to meat.
[215:43.28]I win.
[215:43.48]I'm the new CEO.
[215:46.22]I am now the new CEO.
[215:59.12]That was a pretty good Omega trade, yeah?
[216:07.49]Now short me.
[216:10.81]Not a bad idea.
[216:24.19]Imagine the lobbyists go in and lobby for everyone to care about the meat industry and then they come in like a few days later or the same day and they say, no, no, no, fuck meat.
[216:35.34]You don't want that shit.
[216:37.34]We should get rid of all meat.
[216:45.11]No!
[216:45.89]I got out too quickly.
[216:52.71]Meet industry embarrassed by canceled camera video of management meeting.
[216:56.51]What?
[217:02.48]I didn't orchestrate this.
[217:07.66]I'll take it though.
[217:08.28]$369.
[217:16.13]$391.
[217:16.27]Oh, there's no way I'm not the CEO of the company.
[217:21.25]Half a million.
[217:21.95]I win.
[217:22.49]Yeah, there's no way.
[217:23.21]Volcador.
[217:29.91]Anything Volcador.
[217:30.51]Go.
[217:37.61]Meat.
[217:38.19]Oh my god.
[217:38.97]Meat.
[217:39.70]What the hell?
[217:41.74]Should I jump back on meat?
[217:42.92]4.5 million?
[217:52.66]Alright, I have, that's four and a half million.
[217:54.46]Triple A games.
[217:56.22]No, I'm stepping away.
[217:56.96]Get away, get away.
[217:57.60]I'm done.
[217:59.02]I win.
[218:02.46]I win.
[218:03.44]I'm the CEO of the company now.
[218:12.43]Means I can do stuff like this.
[218:13.47]Smash, smash, smash, smash.
[218:23.03]I didn't mean to throw that at you.
[218:23.91]What's going on here?
[218:32.15]What the fuck is this?
[218:37.72]That's illegal.
[218:38.32]That's not fair.
[218:39.40]You have like five people trading at the same time.
[218:44.12]That's why you thought you were going to be CEO.
[218:50.00]That's illegal.
[218:50.60]That's an illegal move.
[218:54.03]Peak trading.
[218:54.79]No, no, no.
[218:59.61]Yeah, she's just trading super fast.
[219:09.31]What is the bell?
[219:09.97]Oh, there we go.
[219:10.61]Okay, it's over.
[219:11.37]High frequency trading.
[219:18.91]Alright, let's go.
[219:20.01]I'll take it.
[219:21.95]Thank you very much.
[219:23.47]Oh shit, I need more money.
[219:24.67]Oh, I'm going to jail.
[219:30.09]See you later.
[219:30.43]I'm fine.
[219:31.09]I'm alright.
[219:47.01]I just need 4 million more dollars?
[219:49.15]Shit.
[219:56.06]Yeah, yeah, it must be nice.
[219:57.18]Yeah, I'm sure you'll have a far more enjoyable night than the crisis communications team we had to pull to deal with all the negative public attention your work continues to gather.
[220:04.88]It goes without saying that nobody cares about the happiness of PR people, but these firms are outrageously expensive.
[220:09.90]Smarten up.
[220:10.36]This is the last time I'm going to be polite about this.
[220:12.14]Alright, I got one more chance.
[220:14.72]I'm going to be his boss tomorrow anyways.
[220:15.96]Who cares?
[220:33.12]It just keeps increasing, Jerma.
[220:34.38]You can't win.
[220:36.24]Wait, is that for real?
[220:41.06]Wait, what are you talking about?
[220:45.29]That's not true, is it?
[220:46.01]You serious?
[220:54.29]Leave me alone.
[221:03.67]It's not true.
[221:04.67]Wait, I'm confused.
[221:12.89]I'm just... I'm waiting for the bell.
[221:17.01]What?
[221:17.27]Five million more dollars?
[221:22.83]No one has played this game.
[221:23.87]Don't listen to them.
[221:26.53]I'm going to do this one more day.
[221:27.53]And if it increases again, then all right.
[221:36.75]Cold.
[221:37.45]Ooh.
[221:38.23]Electronics.
[221:38.81]We're going in.
[221:47.06]I went all in on electronics.
[221:52.24]FSU.
[221:52.46]How can FSU be going up and down at the same time?
[221:57.42]Dividends, right?
[221:59.18]No.
[221:59.42]Shit.
[222:04.09]How can FSU be going up and down at the same time?
[222:05.49]Electronics.
[222:11.33]Oh, fuck.
[222:12.83]Electronics, come on.
[222:15.81]I can't lobby.
[222:16.23]I don't have enough money.
[222:19.20]I'm down a million dollars so far.
[222:20.54]It's okay.
[222:20.86]Electronics are going up.
[222:32.57]Electronics, let's go.
[222:37.55]What is this bullshit?
[222:43.26]This is bullshit.
[222:44.59]Come on.
[223:02.80]FSU!
[223:03.64]Oh boy!
[223:04.30]This is it.
[223:07.21]This is it.
[223:07.65]This is the end here.
[223:10.08]Oh, yeah.
[223:10.56]This is it.
[223:11.88]FSU and electronics both going up at the same time.
[223:13.84]This is a $5 million trade.
[223:14.82]Let's go.
[223:15.02]Should I stay in or should I get out?
[223:25.21]I'm staying in.
[223:30.15]$5 million.
[223:30.49]$5.2.
[223:32.45]Oh, electro gear.
[223:34.65]Oh, boy.
[223:35.43]If I don't get CEO from this one, I don't know what will.
[223:44.96]6.4 million.
[223:48.03]6.7 million.
[223:51.23]7 million dollars.
[223:52.65]Let's go, boys and girls.
[223:54.71]Get it to 10.
[223:55.41]Holy shit.
[224:06.57]It was like sometimes like the games was real life.
[224:09.43]This would be cool.
[224:10.05]This would be awesome.
[224:11.55]And then like nine million dollars.
[224:13.51]This is that would be fucking awesome.
[224:15.01]Like why can't this be real?
[224:16.09]Let's make it real.
[224:16.79]Like this is real, right?
[224:17.63]That's a ten million dollar trade.
[224:22.00]I win.
[224:28.94]You almost got arrested.
[224:30.12]Video games just went up.
[224:31.10]This is sympathy play.
[224:31.82]Watch this.
[224:33.17]Electronics are going to see sympathy from video games going up.
[224:37.15]This is more than my entire fucking net worth here.
[224:40.85]What do I have?
[224:41.39]Oh, no, it's not.
[224:42.97]27 million.
[224:44.63]Can I do more than my whole net worth?
[224:46.25]What was it?
[224:46.57]12?
[224:46.65]What was it?
[224:47.67]15?
[224:47.69]All right, I'm out.
[224:54.79]Give it to 14.
[224:55.07]All right.
[224:59.65]Volcador is going down.
[225:00.55]That means the Free State Union goes up.
[225:04.66]15 million.
[225:05.28]Come on.
[225:09.58]And I'm just going to go pound coffee to the end of the day.
[225:13.56]Let's see 15.
[225:16.25]No.
[225:17.11]No.
[225:17.51]That's it.
[225:17.83]Get out.
[225:19.61]The 14 million dollar trade.
[225:20.69]I'll see you later.
[225:25.17]Oil going up.
[225:25.73]Food stuff.
[225:31.92]Now we're going to play nice.
[225:45.87]That didn't work out.
[225:46.53]It's all good.
[225:46.99]It's alright.
[225:56.10]Public opinion.
[225:56.80]It's fine.
[226:00.68]I only did lobbying once.
[226:02.08]So it's not going to go down to zero.
[226:04.46]Let's just pound some coffee and get the fuck out of here.
[226:12.78]I only lobbied one time.
[226:13.86]And I only sent two people, not four.
[226:15.60]I've been staring at the coffee machine for like 45 minutes.
[226:56.46]Floor is closing!
[226:57.40]Alright.
[226:58.40]I'm CEO.
[226:59.10]I win.
[227:03.86]Oh, come on.
[227:04.82]Yeah, it's- it's a never-ending...
[227:09.53]It's never ending.
[227:10.27]Alright, VR.
[227:11.31]I lose.
[227:13.73]It's never ending.
[227:14.43]Alright, fine.
[227:15.03]I got the bad ending.
[227:17.27]I got my 15 million dollar trade.
[227:19.97]They can't catch me if I leave out the back door.
[227:34.82]Oh, get out before the boss sees me.
[227:36.82]Oh, I didn't say go home.
[227:43.34]But boss, look at how much money I made us.
[227:46.24]I brought in 25 million dollars.
[227:51.97]You have your PR team working on it?
[227:53.73]I brought in the firm 25 million dollars.
[227:57.66]This is what our lives have to come to!
[228:00.62]Being in the crosshairs of the ugly and unemployed!
[228:28.35]because of you because you can't keep public opinion about us or out of the toilet a word of warning the more philosophical Corbin gets about this kind of shit the closer you are to getting you're in trouble past a certain point in a way anybody can save you I still win why did you write this
[228:56.25]Alright, that's it.
[228:57.01]That's it.
[228:58.33]It's just free play.
[229:00.03]I got my ending and now it's free play.
[229:09.15]It's not.
[229:09.76]Yes, it is.
[229:10.34]It keeps going up.
[229:13.38]What the fuck?
[229:29.80]That looked like Rip Taylor.
[229:39.36]Just drank coffee for four days.
[229:41.95]Well, I'm going to do a $25 million trade.
[229:49.39]I'm going to try to get $30 million on one trade.
[229:51.09]I need tea.
[229:57.88]No, I don't.
[230:03.25]Give me a catalyst.
[230:03.99]Come on.
[230:05.41]I'm ready to go all in at 25 million.
[230:11.73]I'm not going to lobby this time.
[230:13.01]I promise.
[230:13.37]I'm going to do it legit.
[230:23.58]Come on.
[230:24.96]Catalyst.
[230:30.66]Catalyst.
[230:37.35]Catalyst, let's go.

[230:43.93]What's going on?
[230:46.71]Any company in Siena right now?
[230:57.48]It's a Siena company.
[231:04.09]Come on.
[231:20.51]No lobbying.
[231:21.23]I don't need to lobby.
[231:22.57]See?
[231:23.03]Look at that.
[231:24.37]I got 25 million in this right here.
[231:25.59]I'm not gonna lobby.
[231:31.91]Why would I do that?
[231:36.67]I need foodstuffs to take a shit.
[231:39.62]Uno Eats needs to have a huge scandal.
[231:41.62]I need it to take a dump.
[231:47.36]Nope.
[231:49.47]Nope.
[231:50.59]Okay.
[231:51.37]Okay.
[231:52.35]Okay.
[231:52.85]It was very bad.
[231:55.12]Okay.
[232:06.06]He's shorting your viewership.
[232:07.30]He's tanking.
[232:09.84]I don't care.
[232:10.50]Alright.
[232:11.89]What do we do?
[232:12.67]Aquafirma.
[232:13.05]Let's go.
[232:17.77]Meat.
[232:18.05]Short meat.
[232:20.36]Everything, everything.
[232:21.18]How high is this guy?
[232:24.66]I don't know, not high.
[232:29.46]No, I got to find the right one to go into.
[232:32.46]Security, security going down.
[232:33.76]Security, new regulations are holding the security business back.
[232:47.13]Come on.
[232:49.00]How am I going to get my multi-million dollar trade?
[233:06.81]You already had a multi-million dollar trade.
[233:10.25]I know.
[233:11.37]But I want a multi, multi-million dollar trade.
[233:21.47]Meat.
[233:27.05]Oh, that would have been awesome if I had a short on meat.
[233:35.70]Sound.
[233:36.12]Stop the sound from playing.
[233:48.84]Quiet.
[233:49.64]Oh, I gotta get up to the desk.
[233:58.58]Greed is good.
[233:59.18]No, it's not.
[234:00.14]Manpower.

[234:34.76]I'm done.
[234:49.30]You're so close.
[234:51.56]Am I though?
[234:53.38]Oh, you gotta go past four days.
[234:55.18]Alright, fine.
[234:55.58]I'm just gonna pound coffee for four days after this.
[235:07.79]You are raising the bar for the girl every day.
[235:09.73]It's not your goal.
[235:10.81]The competition ends in three days.
[235:13.23]Oh, okay.
[235:17.12]I've been doing too well.
[235:22.96]Well, then I'm just gonna go drink coffee now.

[236:09.64]I can't just drink coffee all day.
[236:15.14]Shit, I can't just drink coffee all day.
[236:16.56]She's halfway there.
[236:25.38]Is it because there's four of her?
[236:37.77]It might be because there's four of her.
[236:40.39]They just tallied up three times of what she was doing over the course of the day.
[236:53.72]I've just started skipping everything she says.

[240:08.27]It's like the game is lagging.
[240:10.05]Like, where are my positions?
[240:24.24]FSU.
[240:24.74]I just made it all back.
[240:25.91]Fuck this.

[240:34.27]I don't even care if I go to jail.
[240:36.89]You can fire me if you want.

[240:57.51]What's happening?
[240:58.39]Alright.

[241:15.44]I just snapped $135,000.
[241:17.03]What the hell?
[241:25.01]It's too slow.
[241:28.21]Alright, I'm done.
[241:30.79]I can't do this anymore.
[241:31.73]I'm out of this.
[241:33.37]I'm done.
[241:33.75]It's too much.
[241:35.05]I'm done.
[241:37.59]I'm done.
[241:38.11]It's over.
[241:38.53]It's over.
[241:38.95]It's over.
[241:39.31]It's over.
[241:39.73]I don't care if I lose.
[241:52.92]Why did I have to do this short on it?
[242:05.43]I lost a million dollars on that stupid trade.
[242:22.28]Bingo That's another million, I'll take it
[242:44.11]You're going to regret this if you don't finish.
[242:46.15]I wish I could just keep it on 25 million.
[242:53.01]Alright, another catalyst.
[242:58.28]Plastics, down.
[243:07.52]Get out.
[243:08.06]Plastics going up.
[243:22.28]Public finance crisis in the, uh, Balcador.
[243:32.04]Come on.
[243:33.94]Oil.
[243:34.10]We need oil to go down.
[243:34.95]Is this game lagging?
[243:43.89]Yeah.
[243:44.23]It's this awful money sound because it's in slow motion.
[243:50.41]I need gas to go down.
[243:53.71]Oil and gas, down.
[243:54.69]Let's get a double whammy.
[244:06.74]Come on.
[244:10.96]Public opinion is not good.
[244:12.40]I might get fired.
[244:19.63]Gas, go down.
[244:25.32]This is a big trade.
[244:26.84]This will keep me ahead of her.
[244:27.74]I need gas to go down though.
[244:31.14]Like, the whole industry needs to go down.
[244:43.57]Alright, get up.
[244:44.13]Alright, drank coffee.
[244:52.19]That's it.
[244:52.75]That's enough.
[244:58.19]you
[245:18.06]Oh no, don't do that.
[245:20.53]I'm at x10 speed.
[245:54.25]Okay, how insane I've felt this whole stream since we went to this game.
[245:57.49]Can you imagine if you did this every day?
[246:01.55]If you were like a day trader and this is what you did, your hair would fall out.
[246:06.95]You would not have hair left.
[246:09.55]You'd have like bags under your eyes and shit.
[246:11.05]This would be horrible.
[246:15.71]Oh shit, I'm almost there.
[246:17.94]I only need a million more dollars.
[246:24.64]Alright, only two more days.
[246:25.52]Did I say go home?
[246:33.00]I buy a house.
[246:33.46]Sell this condo.
[246:38.07]Alright, I'm good.
[246:38.75]I live in this house.
[246:48.52]I have two more days until this is over.
[246:56.39]So again, we're gonna do one big, like, two to three million dollar trade.
[246:59.10]And then, I'm gonna drink coffee all day.
[247:05.68]Eight hours?
[247:06.14]Yeah, I know, but I've told you this before.
[247:09.34]If I'm gonna stream once a week, then I can sit here for- I can be here for eight hours, it's fine.
[247:13.04]I don't- I don't have a problem with this.
[247:16.62]Alright, I'm ready.
[247:26.16]Big trade.
[247:30.94]I don't need tea for this one.
[247:31.88]Alright, where am I going?
[247:47.63]What's the play?
[247:53.94]Wood?
[247:55.12]I didn't believe that.
[247:56.10]I thought this was from yesterday.
[247:58.16]What's the public sentiment look like?
[248:03.42]I can't do any lobbying today.
[248:14.59]Come on, give me something.
[248:18.68]I can lobby tomorrow.
[248:30.52]Look how much she has.
[248:33.46]Where can I do that?
[248:41.51]Don't lobby tomorrow either.
[248:45.53]She's going to lose money today.
[248:46.81]I'm not concerned.
[248:54.18]The reason why I keep getting called by Quinn is because these are up on the screen.
[249:08.17]I missed out, and I missed out on this.
[249:11.36]Looking at my goddamn screen up top.
[249:14.88]She probably caught that trade.
[249:21.53]Wonderful.
[249:34.94]Egg missiles, come on.
[249:42.57]What is this bullshit?
[249:44.34]Up.
[249:49.42]Come on.
[249:49.82]Come on.
[249:50.08]Come on.
[249:50.60]I don't like those dumps.
[249:54.26]What is that?
[249:54.84]What is that?
[249:55.42]What is that?
[249:55.91]Excuse me.
[249:56.63]Excuse me.
[249:57.27]Excuse me.
[249:57.83]I just got fucking... What the fuck?
[250:03.89]I just got... Dumped.
[250:08.35]They just swept me.
[250:17.31]shit god damn it construction I didn't even I didn't even fucking see it I'm just gonna go drink coffee fuck this lady I don't even care I got it it's a lock I don't care
[250:52.11]There's no way she's going to make $10 million in one day.
[251:12.40]Where's her desk?
[251:41.00]Didn't she sit right here?
[251:41.82]Throw stuff at her.
[251:46.79]Mess her up.
[251:50.49]There's no way that she beats me.
[251:53.01]It would take a Christmas miracle.
[251:58.79]Yeah.
[251:59.53]I win.
[251:59.97]It's game over.
[252:00.40]I win.
[252:00.86]She's at 19 million.
[252:01.28]I'm at 28 million.
[252:01.68]I win.
[252:01.86]See you later.
[252:07.83]Competition ends tomorrow.
[252:08.77]No way she makes $10 million in one day.
[252:11.41]Go home.
[252:11.89]Goodbye.
[252:18.75]What did I just do?
[252:19.97]I just leased my own house.
[252:21.07]We'll get a condo and live there.
[252:26.21]We're just going to drink coffee and celebrate in the room until she locks herself in, puts on her headphones, puts Drake on, and just gets in the zone and beats me.
[252:41.87]I'm going to be walking around the office like, ah, I'm going to be the CEO.
[252:45.01]Hooray.
[252:45.43]Shaking hands.
[252:46.07]They have like a big party hat on.
[252:47.21]All right.
[252:59.70]There's no way she gets 10.
[253:00.78]I just can't lose $10 million.
[253:02.26]That's it.
[253:02.96]We're going in on...
[253:14.02]Balcador.
[253:15.82]We're going down to short on Balcador right when we get- okay.
[253:18.94]Coffee?
[253:19.34]No.
[253:20.00]What should I short?
[253:20.90]Balcador?
[253:22.65]The drilling company.
[253:23.53]No.
[253:23.91]That's already way too far down.
[253:25.67]Balcador... Gas company.
[253:29.77]I don't wanna long it!
[253:30.95]I wanna short it, you fucking idiot!
[253:34.85]Misclick!
[253:36.35]Oops!
[253:37.45]Fuck!
[253:38.11]Oh my god, I'm so annoyed right now.
[253:41.15]I'm just- fuck her!
[253:42.03]I'm just drinking coffee, I don't even care.
[253:56.53]Imagine going to work, and you just, you sit down, you press one button, two buttons, you're down 500 grand, you just get up and drink coffee and leave.
[254:03.56]It's, um, well, I don't care, I win.
[254:08.34]She needs 8 million dollars, it's not gonna fucking happen.
[254:14.97]She's not gonna make 8 or 9 million dollars today, it's not happening.
[254:26.70]It's almost as hard as streaming.
[254:28.16]I don't know, man.
[254:33.98]looking at this screen like this, and then putting your money in it, and watching it go up and down, and fucking dropping shit, and like losing and gaining.
[254:41.07]This would be fucking terrifying to do this every day.
[254:44.21]Look, I've traded.
[254:46.47]I've traded.
[254:47.25]I've invested plenty of times.
[254:50.01]Trust me.
[254:51.21]But I could not do it every single day.
[254:52.81]I could not every day for like 10 years straight do this.
[254:56.59]I couldn't do it.
[255:03.14]Oh, puke.
[255:08.17]It's like investing in companies, right?
[255:09.82]Oh, I think this company might do well.
[255:11.10]I think this company might do well.
[255:12.78]Yeah, I'm willing to buy those shares and, like, hold it for a while.
[255:15.82]Or maybe trade.
[255:16.38]Whatever.
[255:17.44]Like, holy fuck.
[255:18.18]Just like, okay.
[255:19.56]Bye.
[255:19.98]Bye.
[255:21.52]I just lost eight grand right now.
[255:24.35]Whatever.
[255:24.79]I'm up $14,000 on this trade here.
[255:28.53]I couldn't do it.
[255:28.95]No fucking way.
[255:29.71]No way.
[255:38.70]Doing that every day.
[255:39.50]Oh, if you can do that, and you can do it well, oh my goodness.
[255:43.84]Good for you.
[255:47.68]I cannot day trade.
[255:48.58]No fucking way.
[255:49.30]Not a million years.
[255:52.91]If trading bots would do it automatically?
[255:58.81]I win.
[256:00.11]Oh, it just ends in 10 days.
[256:01.97]What the fuck are you talking about?
[256:04.33]Why am I still here?
[256:07.87]What happened?
[256:15.67]Underground street fighting thing?
[256:22.32]What is happening?
[256:23.26]Later, traitor.
[256:23.94]What?
[256:24.10]Did I just get to 30 million?
[256:42.08]It's not going to do anything.
[256:42.94]No, that's it.
[256:43.94]It never ends.
[256:46.34]That's it.
[256:49.60]I'll see you guys next week.
[256:50.54]We're going to play Resident Evil Village next week, Saturday and Sunday.
[256:55.00]I'm assuming it'll be four or five hours on Saturday, four or five hours on Sunday.
[257:00.97]We're going to do it.
[257:01.45]It should be fun.
[257:02.97]I've heard very good things about it.
[257:05.25]Thanks for watching the stream.
[257:06.07]I like this game a lot.
[257:07.57]I've been looking for a game like this.
[257:10.77]It's good.
[257:11.95]By the way, nothing in this stream was financial advice.
[257:13.83]I've got to make that very clear.
[257:17.29]Nothing I said in this stream was advice on any securities trading.
[257:22.93]Okay, good.
[257:25.55]Here come the subs.
[257:29.21]Thanks for the subs, everybody.
[257:34.86]That was fun.
[257:35.30]Barnfinders was fun, but I had much more fun in this game.
[257:39.57]I think it just kind of speaks to me a little more, I think.
[257:48.14]Time to day trade and lose millions.
[257:50.24]No, no.
[257:52.06]I would never want to day trade on stream because, oh, I'm going to put a certain amount of money into an account and just broadcast it and look at me doing trades every day.
[258:04.64]I don't want to, if, cause let's be honest, if I were to do that and I, you saw me buy something or you saw me sell something and people would kind of do the same thing.
[258:13.81]Oh, let's jump in on this.
[258:16.51]I don't want that to ever be a possibility.
[258:19.49]I don't think that, I don't like that at all.
[258:21.27]I don't like the idea of like, oh, he bought it.
[258:24.34]So then I bought it and it actually like actually went down and we actually fucking lost money that I don't want.
[258:30.76]That's not going to happen.
[258:31.72]No way.
[258:38.65]Yeah, I wouldn't want to do that.
[258:45.73]Market manipulation.
[258:46.98]Yeah, I am not.
[258:47.88]No, no, thank you.
[258:50.90]No, thanks.
[258:51.64]Don't want to do that.
[258:52.52]Don't want to get involved with that.
[258:55.78]You're an influencer.
[258:56.88]I'm not doing it.
[258:57.96]This is not me announcing that stream.
[259:14.62]Thanks for watching, though.
[259:15.30]It was a lot of fun.
[259:17.14]See you next week for Resident Evil.
[259:21.18]Resident Evil Village.
[259:24.44]Take care of yourselves.
[259:26.02]Good night, as always.
[259:27.56]Have a great week.
[259:29.46]We'll see you for a full weekend.
