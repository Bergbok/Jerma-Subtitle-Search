[00:08.85]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.77]Jerma here with some Slender.
[00:14.45]By popular demand, a lot of people wanted me to play this.
[00:18.01]I got a lot of comments telling me to do this.
[00:20.56]And I looked up some stuff on it, and my god, I'm not ready to play this game.
[00:27.32]But you know what?
[00:28.02]It's Scare Saturdays, so we gotta go.
[00:32.09]The whole point of this game is you're supposed to collect eight pages and avoid this thing that's in the woods.
[00:40.24]The Slenderman.
[00:44.42]Here we go.
[00:44.86]This is just a giant wall in the middle of nowhere.
[00:54.21]Oh my god, a page.
[00:55.19]Okay, there's one.
[00:58.01]Found one page, and it says... Follows.
[01:04.07]How do I pick it up?
[01:04.57]Okay.
[01:08.94]How do I zoom back out?
[01:09.82]How do I zoom out?
[01:10.38]Okay, Q. What is that noise?
[01:16.28]What's going on here?
[01:17.96]I'm just gonna run.
[01:19.76]I don't even want to know.
[01:21.01]I'm not gonna turn around.
[01:21.85]Oh!
[01:29.51]Where is this guy?
[01:30.73]I don't want to go in the same direction that he is.
[01:35.93]Oh my god.
[01:39.75]He's right behind me.
[01:41.27]He's back behind me.
[01:45.19]Oh my god, please tell me there's like a place I can go over here.
[01:52.93]Get me out of here.
[01:54.39]If I'm holding down shift then I can't run that fast.
[02:01.26]Oh!
[02:11.45]Go!
[02:11.95]Go!
[02:12.33]Run!
[02:12.79]Run!
[02:13.39]You mother... He is right behind me!
[02:17.25]Just go!
[02:17.87]I found a little archway.
[02:21.14]A little archway.
[02:21.80]That's what I want.
[02:22.38]That's what I want.
[02:27.72]I don't see him.
[02:29.02]Don't see him.
[02:29.58]Don't see him.
[02:30.04]Don't see him.
[02:30.40]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[02:31.35]Go, go, go, go.
[02:39.60]Let's grab this note.
[02:41.96]The drum beats are gonna drive me crazy.
[02:50.03]Can't run?
[02:52.41]What the hell does that mean?
[02:53.51]Can't run.
[02:58.25]Can't run.
[02:59.89]Great.
[03:01.98]What is it, like a bathroom in the middle of nowhere?
[03:03.98]What the hell is this?
[03:08.39]Alright, I gotta take like a dump.
[03:09.65]Hold on, I gotta go in like the bathroom.
[03:14.31]This is a bad idea, man.
[03:15.97]This is a terrible idea.
[03:17.05]There better be a note in here.
[03:20.09]Oh man!
[03:21.31]Oh my god, oh my god!
[03:24.57]What's with this bathroom?
[03:25.52]This is the weirdest bathroom I've ever seen in my life!
[03:28.96]What is going on up there?
[03:29.98]Oh, there's one.
[03:32.98]There's a note.
[03:34.04]Help me.
[03:39.56]Wonderful.
[03:41.85]Absolutely wonderful.
[03:48.91]Where else have I not been?
[03:50.57]I'm lost in the forest with a madman.
[03:53.95]Oh my...
[04:06.65]That was him.
[04:07.13]Uh, that was him.
[04:08.53]He's right behind me.
[04:10.19]You have to run faster, you son of a bitch.
[04:11.97]Go.
[04:12.37]Go, go, go, go, go.
[04:15.27]What's going on?
[04:15.85]Sticky keys?
[04:16.49]No, screw you.
[04:18.75]Oh my god, he must be right behind me now.
[04:20.15]Dude, like, Windows just had, like, an error because I hit shift way too many times.
[04:26.05]Dude, that's a tree.
[04:32.11]Oh my god.
[04:32.63]Oh my god, oh my god.
[04:33.88]Oh my god.
[04:36.55]Just don't look at him.
[04:37.43]Just don't look at him.
[04:37.95]Just go this way.
[04:38.55]Go this way.
[04:39.03]Go this way.
[04:39.47]Go this way.
[04:39.89]Go this way.
[04:43.87]Oh, man.
[04:46.60]Oh, you... Where's the other notes?
[04:48.88]Alright, never... This is different.
[04:51.22]This is different.
[04:51.74]This could be a note.
[04:54.26]Could be a note here.
[04:56.52]On one of these big trees.
[05:01.18]Come on, give me a note.
[05:02.14]Give me a note.
[05:02.86]Give me a something.
[05:14.39]I have no more run, I have no more run, I have no more run, I have no more run.
[05:22.36]This guy is just a relentless prick.
[05:28.00]Dude, playing Ring Around the Rosie with this guy right now is not a good idea.
[05:31.55]There's nothing over there.
[05:40.94]I just walked into a wall.
[05:43.04]I just walked into a wall.
[05:50.43]Well, I'll see you guys all next time.
[05:52.91]And the link is in the description if you want to play that game.
[05:57.83]Slender.
[05:58.35]I'll see y'all soon.
[06:03.24]Take care, everybody.
