[01:04.30]Hi!
[01:04.36]Oh, this is so much fun, dude.
[01:06.80]This item is so much fun.
[01:10.98]Forget about the mini-crits, man.
[01:12.18]This thing is just a blast.
[01:14.48]Just jumping around is like the funnest damn thing ever.
[01:16.56]This is so much fun.
[01:18.88]Watch this.
[01:19.20]This sniper right here?
[01:19.93]I think this is my... Yeah, there's a sniper right here.

[01:33.63]Oh, he's got this too.
[01:34.41]There's two bird scouts.
[01:37.43]Alright, I'm feeling it.
[01:38.13]I'm feeling the double bird scout.
[01:47.39]Sir, I just shot you like three times.
[01:49.95]Sir, I'm standing in front of you.
[01:52.17]Sir.
[01:53.53]Sir.
[01:55.91]Excuse me, sir.
[02:04.93]See that roost up there?
[02:06.05]See this roost?
[02:07.95]I'm gonna roast their turkeys in a second.
[02:10.55]You're gonna get your fucking turkeys roasted, snipers.
[02:13.55]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[02:16.92]Thought I had more ammo!
[02:19.34]Thought I had more ammo!
[02:21.20]You wanna get your turkey roasted?

[02:23.60]You wanna get your turkey roasted?
[02:25.60]Go ahead and open the door.
[02:31.02]Roasted turkey.
[02:32.32]Oven roasted with some ham and some onion.
[02:35.40]What about this guy?
[02:36.62]You want to get your fucking turkey roasted.
[02:43.76]Are they still up there?
[02:45.14]Oh yeah, they are.
[02:46.42]Oh, you better believe it.
[02:47.24]Please don't shoot me in the face already.
[02:50.99]Make sure I equip the nice bird jump.
[02:55.39]Is anybody up there?
[02:56.91]Whoa.
[02:58.53]See ya.
[03:00.19]See ya later.
[03:02.61]No, come on, get up there.
[03:07.09]It's so dumb.
[03:11.65]I'm out of here.
[03:12.20]See, I left.
[03:13.30]I'm not here.
[03:14.12]You don't have to worry about a thing.
[03:15.24]I'm not here.
[03:15.70]Alright, I'm not here.
[03:17.64]See, I'm gone.
[03:18.84]See, I'm gone.
[03:20.45]I'm gone.
[03:20.87]Don't even worry about it.
[03:22.97]There's no reason to be that concerned about this.
[03:26.00]Just walk into... Just, my God.
[03:28.89]Can I please get this?
[03:30.65]Is it not gonna even happen?
[03:32.47]I'm... Swear to God, dude.
[03:34.45]Please just walk in.
[03:36.15]Don't... Please!
[03:40.28]Earthquake!
[03:43.56]Don't mind me.
[03:45.26]Just gonna chill out right here.
[03:47.88]I'm gonna get seen.
[03:48.64]There's no way no one's gonna see me do this.
[03:52.12]Some soldier's gonna turn the corner.
[03:53.48]Wait.
[03:54.76]I spy in the window.
[03:55.82]I think he's AFK.
[03:59.54]Oh my fucking god!
[04:02.24]Oh.
[04:03.04]My.
[04:04.79]God.
[04:05.25]Oh, that only- only to- I don't have any words for that.
[04:11.49]I don't have words for that.
[04:14.37]I just got so destroyed right there.
[04:17.24]That was horrible.
[04:24.48]I'm on his head.
[04:26.22]He didn't even know.
[04:26.84]He doesn't know.
[04:29.95]He didn't even know.
[04:33.07]He didn't even know.
[04:35.17]Give me that health pack.
[04:36.79]Can I have that health pack, please?
[04:40.81]You want to jump scare me, Medic?
[04:43.39]Is that what you want to do?
[04:43.99]You want to jump scare me?
[04:44.95]Huh?
[04:45.09]I ain't gonna get jump scared twice.
[04:48.26]That's a spy.
[04:50.18]You want to go?
[04:50.72]You want to activate the bird scout?
[04:52.38]Come on.
[04:53.28]Bird scout.
[04:54.90]Ooh, see you later.
[04:57.38]You think you're gonna get away.
[04:59.06]You can never defeat the bird scout.
[05:04.21]Come on, dudes.
[05:06.31]Where's the... Oh, hello.
[05:10.73]Oh, hello.
[05:21.26]The confusion.
[05:22.42]Confusion sets in.
[05:25.12]And I actually get a kill.
[05:27.06]But that's not what I wanted.
[05:27.96]God, that's gonna be such a pain in the ass to deal with.
[05:32.93]A scout jumping around all over you is annoying.
[05:34.91]A scout jumping around all around you 20, 30 feet in the air has gotta be even more annoying.
[05:40.83]There's a lot of people stuffed in that room.
[05:44.67]Here we go.
[05:44.95]This is what I wanna do.
[05:50.84]I can't...
[05:52.96]Hi everybody, how are you?
[05:54.67]What?
[05:55.55]You... How did he hit me with a melee?
[05:59.53]That didn't make any sense.
[06:00.91]I was like 40 feet above everybody.
[06:05.87]Holy hell, what the hell was that?
[06:09.72]Oh, watch this, this heavy, this heavy, this heavy.
[06:11.56]Here we go.
[06:12.64]What, what's going on?
[06:22.61]I... What happened?
[06:25.32]What just happened?
