[00:29.86]Come on down.
[00:36.52]Hey, hold on, I gotta, I gotta... Here we go, that's better.
[00:47.18]Hey, look, it's that dumb streamer guy.
[00:50.13]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Prize is Right, today's contestants.
[00:54.25]We're kicking it off swell here with Game Show Week.
[00:59.27]Starting with The Prize is Right.
[01:04.55]Tell them what he's won.
[01:05.63]Nothing yet, because he hasn't started playing.
[01:10.65]Hi.
[01:16.09]So, I don't know how bad this is.
[01:17.74]Here we go.
[01:18.34]Here we go.
[01:19.80]I don't know what I'm going to say.
[01:22.44]So, this could go very well or it could go very bad.
[01:26.27]It's okay because I have like seven game shows.
[01:28.75]So, we've got a lot of stuff to do this week.
[01:32.89]By the way, this week's streams are going to be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in a row.
[01:38.93]No Friday because I'm not going to be here.
[01:40.70]I am going to the wonderful, wonderful city of Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:45.88]So, I won't be here.
[01:48.65]I will not be here on Friday.
[01:50.33]So we're doing tomorrow and Thursday.
[01:52.57]One, two, three in a row.
[01:55.87]Let me turn this down so this isn't so annoying in your ears.
[02:00.38]And let me just pop this out.
[02:04.18]And all on double zero.
[02:08.20]I think we could do that.
[02:10.96]I actually might do an IRL stream from Vegas.
[02:13.36]I might just do it for like a minute.
[02:16.97]I don't know.
[02:17.31]I'm not, like, comfortable doing that, though.
[02:19.33]I'm not sure.
[02:19.83]Who knows?
[02:20.19]We'll see.
[02:22.37]Anywho.
[02:23.63]Let me just make a tweet.
[02:24.63]I will be right back.
[02:25.17]Enjoy the music for the next, like, do-ma-ta-ja-do-ya-do.
[02:28.35]And I'll be right back.

[04:09.80]We need to change player, though.
[04:10.78]I had to just make an account while I loaded the game for the first time.
[04:15.46]So we're going to have to make a new contestant.
[04:18.72]We're going to go with...
[04:21.54]It's always an old fucking lady on The Price is Right.
[04:24.41]And they always have the Hi Bob shirt on.
[04:26.11]This, by the way, this is, uh, God, uh, God rest his soul, Bob Barker, I believe, is on this, uh, version of the video game.
[04:32.85]This is about 15 years old, I believe.
[04:34.49]So, uh, Bob Barker, R.I.P., God bless his soul, Bob Barker.
[04:39.36]And, uh, we're gonna have to go with, uh, we're gonna go with Dottie.

[47:39.94]Who would even keep track of this?
[47:55.07]Welcome to the showcase.
[47:56.94]How would you keep track of your achievements in this game?
[47:59.22]This showcase features prizes revealed as we visit an archaeological dig.
[48:05.38]And first, our archaeologist comes across this amazing stone that resembles old poker chips, which clearly came from a very early period in Monte Carlo.
[48:20.26]Meet a guest!

[48:28.01]Hey!
[48:28.17]Hey, we're going to Italy, too!
[48:45.52]You and a guest will fly a round-trip coach from Los Angeles to Rome, Italy for a six-night stay and a daily breakfast included at the Grand Hotel Tiberio, a superior four-star hotel near the Vatican City.
[48:55.28]Delighted in its refinement and elegance, enjoy the modern needs of comfort with the traditional rules of hospitality from Grand Hotel Tiberio.
[49:03.73]And the final thing she finds is a strangely shaped specimen that looks like an ancient band.
[49:09.17]Hey, guess where else we're going.

[51:16.62]A selection of power tools, professional-grade tools that are designed for do-it-yourselfers who want to remodel non-stop.
[51:24.45]And... And... Jack Gannon, a not-so-fun game... This guy's probably shitting his pants right now.
[51:29.67]...that required a player to take a jack and rotate all four tires on their brand new car.
[51:36.74]It's all right.
[51:37.26]It's okay.

[52:33.77]Would you like to play again?
[52:35.43]No, I'm... Next.
[52:37.28]I'm going to the bathroom next.
[52:38.54]We'll be back with fucking Family Feud.
[52:41.08]I'll be right back.
[52:42.27]I gotta take a second.
[52:43.07]That's un-fucking-believable.
[53:04.92]so so
[53:44.95]Yeah.
[54:57.46]Alright, hold on.
[54:57.88]Give me a second.
[55:01.68]There's that.
[55:07.36]Alright, so let's open up.
[55:09.82]Let's get the next game going.
[55:11.11]The next game on Game Show Week.
[55:14.51]Actually, I don't know.
[55:15.05]What do you guys think for the next game?
[55:19.41]Here are your options.
[55:22.31]We could do Family Feud or Wheel of Fortune.
[55:24.45]What do you think?
[55:28.36]What would you guys rather see right now?
[55:31.04]Family Feud is, like, we'll be going back to it a bunch of times, but, like, there's also, like, we're gonna play Wheel of Fortune at some point.
[55:39.00]Let's see.
[55:39.28]Let's see what you guys think.
[55:41.49]We'll do a straw poll.
[55:42.71]Why not?
[55:46.75]And, by the way, this Family Feud is not the, like, Super Nintendo one.
[55:50.23]This is a legit, like, full-motion video Family Feud.
[55:54.17]I think the other one is, too.
[55:56.82]But which one do you want to see next?
[55:58.44]Wheel of Fortune or Family Feud?
[56:06.67]Let's make the poll.
[56:07.63]Here you go, guys.
[56:11.79]Take a vote.
[56:13.03]By the way, we will be playing both of these at some point throughout the week.
[56:17.02]So you will see both of these.
[56:18.24]Just which one do you want to see right now?
[56:21.74]Which would you rather see right now?
[56:28.39]We'll let that roll for a little while because it is fairly close.
[56:36.55]Why is it always so close?
[56:38.37]Yeah, but family feuds are going to take us a while because obviously that's a big ticket item.
[56:44.64]So either or, this is a game show a week.
[56:47.68]There's plenty of options.
[56:49.06]We've got a lot of options here.
[56:51.96]This is fucking really close.
[56:53.16]Holy shit.
[56:56.00]This is incredibly close.
[57:01.76]I want to see the bumps in full motion video.
[57:07.26]Yeah, we do.
[57:07.98]We run a democratic stream here.
[57:10.54]So whatever wins is what... This is a democratic stream.
[57:17.55]And we go by whatever happens on our democracy.
[57:24.41]Alright, I'm going to close this poll out here in like 10 to 20 seconds.
[57:29.70]Get your votes in now.
[57:37.07]Winner take all.
[57:38.37]The FM, the FM bumps.
[57:42.33]All right.
[57:42.81]Wheel of Fortune has pulled ahead by a substantial amount at this point by at least five or six percent here.
[57:49.06]And we're going to close it.
[57:50.04]Poll closes in 10 seconds.
[57:51.26]There we go.
[57:51.88]Thank you for voting.
[57:53.54]We're going to do Wheel of Fortune.
[57:56.14]Wheel of Fortune.
[57:59.78]Thank you very much for voting.
[58:00.50]The poll is closed.
[58:03.68]All right.
[58:04.06]Here we go.
[58:06.37]By the way, the Wheel of Fortune, uh, not the Wheel of Fortune, the Family Feud version that I have is, uh, is Louis Anderson.
[58:10.75]It's not, uh, Steve Harvey.
[58:12.75]And it's not the, uh, like, the old guy from, like, the 70s.
[58:17.01]It's Louis Anderson.
[58:17.87]Okay, give me one second.
[58:21.44]Let me open that up.
[58:24.94]Get it up, and here we go for Wheel of Fortune.
[58:29.46]Oh, whoops.
[58:30.92]Oh, shit.
[58:33.16]Shit!
[58:34.44]I fucked it up.
[58:35.54]Whoops!
[58:35.78]Whoops!
[58:38.04]I forgot to, I forgot to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[58:44.68]I forgot to open it with a certain, I have to open it with this like weird program.
[58:48.89]Otherwise it won't open.
[58:49.91]I forgot to open the weird program.
[58:54.05]So let's get that open here.
[58:55.39]There we go.
[58:55.89]A wheel of fortune.
[59:01.23]Let's see if I can get that to work.
[59:07.50]There it is.
[59:08.06]And there it is.
[59:10.58]Okay, good.
[59:11.08]Good, good, good.
[59:14.72]Good.
[59:15.86]Window capture.
[59:16.60]This is so fucking loud, by the way.
[59:24.17]Can you hear this shit?
[59:28.59]I'm going to keep... Wow, loud.
[59:33.31]Okay, I need to improvise here because this is fucked up.
[59:40.73]But it's okay.
[59:42.59]And it's not recognizing.
[59:44.51]It's not recognizing this.
[59:47.21]So I'm going to have to do this.
[59:48.05]We're going to do improvisation here, guys.
[59:54.05]Improvisation.
[59:58.25]Let's do this.
[59:59.33]It should work now.
[60:00.22]Window capture.
[60:01.06]Nope, there we go.
[60:07.93]That's okay.
[60:09.59]And here comes my fucking monitor.
[60:11.01]Oh, God.
[60:11.57]Oh, my God.
[60:14.71]Look at this shitty desktop.
[60:16.09]Okay.
[60:17.47]I need to do this.
[60:20.17]Hey, look at that.
[60:21.15]Except it's like tiny in the middle.
[60:22.33]And if I alt tab, it does that.
[60:23.67]So we need to do this.
[60:25.25]Oh, Lord.
[60:25.83]What a fucking pain.
[60:28.75]We're going to have to do like this because this shit don't work.
[60:34.11]And I can't, like... Holy fuck, dude.
[60:38.23]Holy fuck.
[60:41.58]Come here.
[60:42.90]Come here.
[60:45.40]I can't, like... Oh my god, what a fucking monument.
[60:49.44]Okay, if I hit the... If I alt-tab and hit the Windows key, look at this shit.
[60:54.93]God, I fucking hate old games.
[60:59.91]Almost.
[61:00.17]We're almost there.
[61:00.67]We're almost there.
[61:01.11]I swear, we're almost there.
[61:04.20]We're close.
[61:07.02]I don't even- I, like, don't even care.
[61:08.50]You know what I mean?
[61:08.94]Like, hold on.
[61:09.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[61:10.10]One more little turn here.
[61:13.72]And I- Okay, whatever.
[61:16.20]You guys can see it.
[61:16.76]I don't even give a shit.
[61:17.58]Like, I ain't- Good.
[61:18.56]Here we go.
[61:22.83]Okay.
[61:23.39]This is gonna be loud as hell.
[61:28.07]Okay, done.
[61:29.78]Hi, folks.
[61:30.62]I'm Charlie O'Donnell.
[61:31.55]So loud.
[61:32.01]We'll get to our game in a second.
[61:33.33]Good enough.
[61:33.99]We have a little business to take care of.
[61:36.33]Why is there a fucking... What's with the mouse in the middle of the screen?
[61:39.53]What have you done?
[61:41.49]Hold on, hold on.
[61:43.49]Wait, just give me a second.
[61:44.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:44.97]Quit the game.
[61:47.57]Good prepared stream.
[61:49.25]Okay, let me just make this very clear.
[61:51.88]Getting these games to run is like ripping my penis off with the other end of a hammer.
[61:57.94]Give me a little bit of slack.
[62:00.06]I'm going to get this dumb shit to work.
[62:02.51]Don't worry.
[62:03.03]It's going to work, as you see.
[62:05.89]I don't care about who fucking made this game.
[62:07.25]I want to get the mouse off the screen.
[62:13.00]Compatibility mode, Windows 98.
[62:14.46]Dude, I have to have a fucking separate program open.
[62:18.22]To open this program.
[62:21.18]It's not as easy as that.
[62:26.83]Oh my god!
[62:31.29]And now this shit... This shit won't even open the way that I need it to.
[62:35.29]What a fucking... Just kill that process.
[62:38.41]Let's try this again.
[62:41.18]Why is it doing, like, what?
[62:43.06]Alright, we're moving on to fucking Family Feud, because this is fucking stupid.
[62:46.12]I'll be right back.
[62:52.91]Oh my god.
[62:53.59]I swear to fucking god.
[62:57.29]I swear to god.
[62:58.71]Like, this shit, I spent, like, seven hours getting this to work.
[63:02.98]What a fucking, what a joke.
[63:05.46]This is the fucking program I have to have.
[63:08.64]And, like, now the program just doesn't work anymore.
[63:10.72]Literally, like, on stream now it doesn't work.
[63:12.30]You just saw it work.
[63:12.94]What happened?
[63:13.94]Who fucking knows?
[63:15.56]I wish I had any idea.
[63:19.58]There goes the wheel.
[63:21.84]Uh, okay.
[63:22.64]Let's try this one more time.
[63:27.54]Maybe it's because of the virus.
[63:31.06]So, it doesn't matter how much you prepare.
[63:32.60]It really doesn't.
[63:33.28]Because, like, these games are all old, broken pieces of shit.
[63:36.27]So, it doesn't matter how much you prepare.
[63:40.12]Uh, don't matter.
[63:41.92]Shit don't even matter.
[63:43.16]So, but it is, I will get it to work.
[63:47.08]I fucking trust me on that.
[63:49.86]This fucking asshole fucking program.
[63:52.30]Run in the window.
[63:53.70]Yes.
[63:56.43]Okay.
[63:56.91]Holy fuck.
[63:58.57]Just don't.
[64:01.13]Just continue.
[64:02.09]Oh my god.
[64:05.07]Oh my god.
[64:06.81]Just, okay.

[103:06.70]Sorry.
[103:07.14]But come back and try again.
[103:08.98]Anytime.
[103:10.29]Bye-bye.
[103:10.73]Alright, well, let's... I'm curious about what all this shit is.
[103:16.17]The green room.
[103:20.22]Carrie O'Brien, contestant coordinator.
[103:22.12]Me, a good... The great motivator.
[103:24.67]And only three seats at the wheel.
[103:25.89]The search for the perfect contestant.
[103:27.09]Me, a good contestant.
[103:28.81]Would I make a good contestant?
[103:29.89]That's an interesting question because I think so.
[103:32.43]I think I have a certain energy that would be helpful.
[103:34.47]But at the same time, I don't know.
[103:35.89]I could get...
[103:37.37]The perfect Wheel of Fortune contestant would probably be someone at home that you would root for.
[103:41.73]Look at these bonuses, guys.
[103:42.49]That you could really get behind.
[103:43.63]That is someone who's going to carry the show well, who's going to keep the show moving along.
[103:48.07]Wait, what's the best part of the job, Mark Corwin?
[103:49.99]Well, I tell you, probably the best part is to sit at home and watch the show because that's when you really get to sit down.
[103:57.39]and realize that you've done something uh with a great group of people putting your show together and making something happen and then to sit back and enjoy the contestants and whether it's patent it's like a whole documentary back here dressing room and how comfortable the viewers are what was life like before wheel of fortune before wheel of fortune I uh I was struggling a little bit I had some part-time jobs as a waitress and went on auditions cocktail waitress like that
[104:26.40]So and then, Wheel of Fortune came along.
[104:30.20]What was that?
[104:32.66]What was that?
[104:33.02]Did you hear that?
[104:35.60]That sounded like me in the background again.
[104:37.60]Listen.
[104:38.00]Listen to the end.
[104:38.50]Before Wheel of Fortune, I was struggling a little bit.
[104:42.72]I had some part-time jobs as a waitress and went on auditions and things like that.
[104:49.06]So and then, Wheel of Fortune came along.
[104:53.34]Did you hear that?
[104:57.46]That was weird.
[104:58.16]Okay.
[105:00.46]Bloodsail Waitress.
[105:01.26]All right, how about the announcer?
[105:02.18]Charlie O'Donnell.
[105:03.28]Hey, how do you... What's your warm-up like, Charlie?
[105:05.54]It's really the best part of the show because the audience comes here expecting God knows what.
[105:10.28]And the first person they see is me and I scare the daylights out of them.
[105:14.82]Wait, wait.
[105:16.20]Wait, what?
[105:19.40]What is the context here?
[105:20.56]That's really the best part of the show because the audience comes here expecting God knows what.
[105:25.49]And the first person they see is me and I scare the daylights out of them.
[105:28.95]What is that an answer to?

[127:26.59]What else do you do with a mustache?
[127:34.91]Shave.
[127:36.83]Shave it off.
[127:40.63]No, that's not like what you do with a mustache.
[127:45.35]See?
[127:45.79]You don't shave.
[127:46.51]Okay, I don't have any idea.

[133:01.39]It's all right.

[133:02.78]They're very good answers.
[133:06.66]Name a subject most Americans are preoccupied with.
[133:09.04]Sports.
[133:09.34]It's going to be at least 15 to 20.
[133:11.96]Show it to us.
[133:14.22]It's okay.
[133:14.74]It's all right.
[133:15.10]We're going to be fine.
[133:16.62]The next answer is a doozy.

[133:18.98]We only need a small amount of points.
[133:21.81]Name something kids forget to take to school.
[133:23.51]You forget your homework.
[133:24.73]You forget your homework.

[133:26.39]Let's see if it was there.
[133:28.69]Woo!
[133:31.99]That's just barely a victory.
[133:36.18]I win.
[133:36.96]That was so close.
[133:39.18]Wow, $10,000.
[133:39.90]Congratulations.
[133:41.86]See you again on our next game of Family Feud.
[133:44.50]Goodbye, everybody.
[133:47.21]What a shitty ending.
[133:56.04]Are you serious?
[133:57.64]You just get to watch Louis Anderson dance for like 30 seconds?
[134:02.67]That's it.
[134:02.99]That's what you get for winning.
[134:04.41]That's what you get for winning the game.
[134:06.49]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:08.21]Go back.
[134:08.45]I wanna see something.
[134:09.87]Let's go to the farms.
[134:10.89]Hold on.
[134:11.51]Create a new character.
[134:24.47]Oh, Jesus.
[134:24.75]Import face.
[134:25.33]Are you kidding me?
[134:26.43]Hold on just a second.
[134:27.85]Hold on a second.
[134:28.71]Wait, it's guys.
[134:29.27]This is important.
[134:29.65]What?
[134:29.75]Why is everybody so gross?
[134:30.61]What?
[134:50.85]Nasty.
[134:51.93]Grim.
[134:52.53]Ay caramba.
[134:54.95]Yikes.
[134:56.10]Oink, oink.
[134:57.26]Good gracious.
[134:58.96]Scary.
[135:00.10]Auga.
[135:01.58]Mercy.
[135:02.56]Holy shit, this guy is terrible.
[135:05.28]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[135:10.69]Hold on.
[135:11.91]Give me one second.
[135:12.81]This is very, very important.
[135:15.65]This is extremely important.
[135:17.11]Hold on.
[135:19.29]Just bear with me for a second.
[135:24.74]If you want to use a photo of your own for a character's face, we'll minimize the game so you can search for the file.
[135:30.56]Okay, that sounds good.
[135:31.64]Hold on a second.
[135:33.38]Give me a minute here.
[135:36.34]Where is that picture?
[135:38.30]This is no fucking way.
[135:39.24]This is no way.
[135:41.75]This is this thing, right?
[135:46.02]I need to find, like, I think I have, like, a couple on the desktop here.
[135:49.01]Hold on.
[135:49.35]Uh, what is this?
[135:56.21]Hold on.
[135:56.65]Maybe I'll just put, like... Alright, here's, like, a picture of, like, me and Muselk.
[136:02.74]Hold on a second.
[136:07.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[136:10.84]I know what I can do.
[136:16.10]Hold on, hold on.
[136:21.28]This is, I gotta get this picture right.
[136:22.82]So you're gonna have to bear with me.
[136:26.74]This is very important that I get this in the right spot.
[136:37.71]Okay, here.
[136:38.43]Here we go.
[136:40.61]Desktop.
[136:42.05]Uh, it's gotta be a fucking bitmap file.
[136:44.46]Oh lord, really?
[136:47.42]Hold on, I gotta save.
[136:48.26]This is a bitmap.
[136:50.29]Yeah, honestly, I'll be right back.
[136:51.84]This is very important.
[137:44.49]I'm saving this image as a bitmap.
[137:47.41]It's very important.
[137:48.49]We got to get this.
[137:50.77]I have to go into Photoshop for a second.
[137:52.57]Hold on.
[137:53.71]This will be worth it.
[137:58.48]It's a loud P. I don't know what this is going to look like.
[138:02.62]There's going to be a grand reveal here.
[138:09.45]Hopefully it's not too big of a file.
[138:13.80]Save as a bitmap.
[138:18.36]Bitmap is BMP, right?
[138:27.81]Let's see what happens.
[138:28.49]Hold on.
[138:32.42]We're going to minimize the game so you can choose your picture.
[138:35.44]See you soon.
[138:37.78]Okay.
[138:38.58]Is it going to work?
[138:39.80]Will this work?
[138:40.60]Match the picture to the markings as best you can.
[138:43.24]You move the picture by moving your mouse.
[138:45.00]Shit, it's too big.
[138:45.90]Hold on.
[138:46.34]Hold on.
[138:46.66]It was too big.
[138:51.72]I'll get it.
[138:52.16]Don't worry.
[138:59.05]This is so important.
[139:06.39]It's going to have to be small.
[139:09.06]Mine was too big.
[139:12.10]Okay, that's good.
[139:17.50]Alright, hold on.
[139:19.02]Almost there.
[139:26.43]This joke is going to be worth it.
[139:28.15]I promise.
[139:34.63]And then we're just going to bring this out as a bitmap.
[139:40.89]Come on.
[139:45.95]Last shot here.
[139:46.81]Come on.
[139:47.09]I know.
[139:47.37]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[139:47.93]Come on.
[139:48.29]This is the one.
[139:56.43]Try to match the picture to the markings as best you can.
[139:59.14]Mark the picture by moving your mouse.
[140:01.72]To scale your picture to better fit the markings, use the plus or minus sign buttons.
[140:06.64]Yeah, I... You can toggle the grid on and off to take a better look at the face you are creating.
[140:11.53]Match the skin tone... Wait, hold on.
[140:13.21]There's a readme file.
[140:14.73]There's a readme file.
[140:16.93]When you have your face just the way you... Hold on.
[140:21.30]I need to put a picture of a fucking dog up or something.
[140:24.47]Like, I didn't know.
[140:25.21]There's going to be something.
[140:28.39]We'll do that later.
[140:29.07]We're going to do that next time.
[140:30.83]I'm going to get that ready to go.
[140:32.23]And we'll do it next time.
[140:34.05]Because, like, unfortunately, this is going to take too much time.
[140:37.52]And, obviously, I don't want to sit here and have you guys just watch me, like, do that.
[140:40.64]So, we're going to go and do that some other time.
[140:44.32]Because that's, like, a huge pain in the ass, apparently.
[140:46.06]So, let's just go back to do it.
[140:49.68]Damn, it's huge.
[140:50.84]Here we go.
[141:03.88]Don't worry, this just happens when you open this shit.
[141:07.44]It just does this for no reason, so that's fine.
[141:10.72]Okay.
[141:11.38]Back to the game.
[141:11.94]We're going to do it again.
[141:13.86]There we go.
[141:15.93]Back to reality.
[141:18.23]I will get that to fucking happen.
[141:19.95]Don't worry.
[141:20.29]It will be worth it.
[141:21.55]I'm going to make like seven characters off stream.
[141:29.62]There comes the loud noises.
[141:33.88]Or maybe not.
[141:36.94]How dare you do it?
[141:37.94]Well, I can't sit there and do that.
[141:41.17]Because people will just leave.
[141:42.97]Because it's going to take me like 20 minutes.
[141:44.71]So, no.
[141:45.05]We're going to play another Family Feud.
[141:49.55]And we will do this, I promise.
[141:51.03]We're going to get a bunch of created characters.
[141:58.82]I don't want you guys to know who they're going to be.
[142:02.50]Let's go.
[142:08.09]Make the CPU better.
[142:08.83]That is so funny.
[142:24.18]You can see the desktop.
[142:31.89]I know you can see the desktop.
[142:33.11]And you know why?
[142:33.81]Because this game is uncapturable.
[142:37.71]And I have to, like, do monitor capture.
[142:41.13]And if I alt-tab to try to size it the correct way, the game will crash.
[142:46.88]So, it's like, it has to be like this, apparently.
[142:52.03]If I even take my mouse off the screen, the game crashes.
[142:54.36]Time for the family feud, everybody.
[142:55.88]Let's have some good old-fashioned family fun.
[142:58.00]Good luck, everybody.
[142:58.88]A hundred people serving.
[143:04.84]We've got their top five answers up there.
[143:07.24]Here we go.
[143:07.50]All right, after this one, I'm going to read some bits.
[143:09.96]You need a lot of with the baby in the house.
[143:12.50]You need a lot of.
[143:13.62]A lot of patience.
[143:15.70]No, a lot of...
[143:21.61]Patience.
[143:25.35]There it is!
[143:30.14]Good answer, but there's one that can beat it.
[143:31.94]Good answer.
[143:32.56]They're not gonna get it.
[143:39.02]They won't even answer.
[143:40.58]Laundry.
[143:41.86]Laundry soap.
[143:43.48]Okay.
[143:45.58]Honestly, dude, the families from the SNES version had good answers.
[143:50.64]These answers are terrible.
[143:53.35]These answers are awful.
[143:54.61]I'm going to play it.
[144:03.76]We're going to say love.
[144:06.66]We're going to say milk.
[144:12.82]Love.
[144:14.18]Let's do all the cheeky, shitty dumb answers first.
[144:17.56]Why not?
[144:17.84]That's okay.
[144:20.14]That's fine.
[144:20.48]That's fine.
[144:20.84]Diapers.
[144:21.20]Good old diapers.
[144:22.64]Diapers.
[144:36.37]Diapers There it is number one answer diapers Shit I don't know what the fuck else Ear plugs
[145:06.31]Milk formula, good.
[145:07.15]Good, good, good, good, good.
[145:15.13]Yes!
[145:16.19]Yes!
[145:17.17]Powder?
[145:18.94]Safety?
[145:20.20]I'm gonna say, we'll say powder.
[145:21.78]Like baby powder.
[145:25.62]Formula?
[145:26.30]Oh, fuck.
[145:27.64]No, but formula... Isn't formula... No, it's right there.
[145:32.54]Milk and formula is the same thing.
[145:35.24]Next family, one more strike and you get a chance to steal.

[160:27.00]That was a big mistake from the developers.
[160:29.13]You shouldn't get a dance unless you win.
[160:36.73]I feel cheated.
[160:37.71]Alright, we'll get this last one.

[164:19.68]Pass it.
[164:20.16]Do it.
[164:33.08]Pass it.
[164:34.26]They're out passing, okay.
[164:34.94]Beer.
[164:35.08]Beer.
[164:50.85]Booze.
[164:54.13]I didn't even write wow.
[164:55.81]Holy shit.
[164:58.54]Everything is going to be so specific.
[164:59.82]I don't know.
[165:01.58]Leftovers.
[165:01.80]Takeout.
[165:02.02]Takeout.
[165:02.20]Food.
[165:02.64]I don't know.
[165:03.04]I don't know.
[165:03.42]I don't know.
[165:04.02]Takeout.
[165:04.24]I don't know.
[165:04.54]Is it there?
[165:04.98]Show it.
[165:17.52]I don't fucking know.
[165:19.90]The recipes are gonna be so specific.
[165:24.68]Drink, soda, food.
[165:26.16]What else would you have in a fridge?
[165:27.28]Bachelors don't have milk.
[165:28.56]Uh, soda.
[165:28.94]Oh my god.
[165:29.22]Milk.
[165:29.54]It's not gonna be milk.
[165:45.65]Why would it be milk?
[165:48.51]What bachelor has milk in their fridge?
[165:51.11]Ketchup?
[165:51.99]Condiments?
[165:53.43]Cheese?
[165:54.25]Alright, I'm gonna go with Chad here.
[165:56.59]I'm gonna go with milk.
[165:57.49]I knew it wasn't fucking milk.
[166:05.80]I knew it.
[166:08.20]Nothing.
[166:08.62]That's actually a really good answer.
[166:10.16]Nothing.
[166:13.39]I don't think the computer is smart enough to do that.
[166:15.33]They're going to write like rope.
[166:19.80]Hot dogs.
[166:20.40]No, you're wrong.
[166:20.88]You're wrong.
[166:21.24]Mold.
[166:21.42]That's fine.
[166:22.82]Okay.
[166:23.06]So it's going to be nothing, right?
[166:25.66]Mold.
[166:27.98]TD dinner.
[166:42.75]Well, nothing wasn't even right.
[166:44.56]So we're all good.
[166:48.82]That brings us to the end of the first round.
[166:51.06]Let's look at the scores.
[166:52.22]This host scares me.
[166:53.24]Well, it's Louis Anderson.
[166:54.88]He's kind of a guy, I guess.
[166:57.80]Family number two, you're not far off the lead.
[167:02.04]Let's move on to round two.
[167:02.92]You did it.
[167:06.82]When am I going to play a real game?
[167:08.44]This is a real game, man.
[167:13.25]It is sometimes smart to allow certain people to think that they are wiser than you.
[167:17.09]What do you think it is, family number two?
[167:18.29]There was so much words there.
[167:20.15]What are you talking about?
[167:21.03]Look at all the theories.
[167:22.00]Sometimes smart to allow certain people to think they are wiser than you.
[167:25.40]I want to see that answer.
[167:26.92]There was like 16 extra words in that sentence.
[167:29.20]No, I'm sorry.
[167:31.28]It's sometimes smart to allow certain people to think they are wiser than you.
[167:34.40]Name one of those people.
[167:37.55]I don't know.
[167:38.49]A teacher?
[167:38.79]Teacher?
[167:42.98]Significant other?
[167:43.70]I don't... Teacher is so low.
[167:46.66]Boss?
[167:46.98]Spouse?
[167:54.76]Boss is definitely one of them, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.
[167:59.12]I'm passing it.
[167:59.78]I don't know the random fucking two or three other dumb answers.
[168:02.98]They're not going to get it.
[168:06.80]Boss and like... No, they're not going to get it.
[168:11.92]Police.
[168:12.82]Policeman.
[168:13.42]I hope it's up there for you.
[168:16.76]I don't think that's going to be up there.
[168:17.70]Nope.
[168:20.58]Sorry, not on the board.
[168:21.38]Strike one.
[168:23.56]Nope.
[168:26.20]Don't think they're gonna get it.
[168:27.52]Banker.
[168:27.88]Why would you even care if a banker was smarter than you?
[168:30.58]Hey, I'd like to deposit this check.
[168:32.26]Oh, God, I hope you know you're smarter than me.
[168:46.20]I'd like to make a deposit.
[168:48.86]You're so much better than me.
[168:51.06]Doctor.
[168:51.28]I mean, I guess that's close enough, right?
[168:52.86]That's good enough.
[168:53.54]Alright, so boss.
[168:54.16]Boss is number one.
[168:54.96]Boss is number one.
[169:11.67]Your boss.
[169:12.71]Boss.
[169:13.13]That's number one.
[169:14.53]Got it.
[169:15.01]There are tons of idiots that think they're smarter than her and end up getting mad when something happens because of it.
[169:33.33]Spouse.
[169:33.79]I see boss, spouse, and parent.
[169:35.65]Well, I would have got the first two.
[169:38.36]Yeah, you have to assume that the banker, like, knows what they're doing, though.
[169:40.68]And, like, knows what they're doing with your money.
[169:42.16]Well, I'm killing it right now.
[169:46.57]I just can't... I can't lose on the third round.
[169:48.33]This is important.
[169:51.77]Let's do it!
[170:04.18]You know the drill.
[170:05.17]How many people did the survey?
[170:06.73]Top five answers up on the board.
[170:09.19]Good luck.
[170:09.69]Here we go.
[170:11.33]Name something that people soak.
[170:13.65]What do you think it is, family number one?
[170:16.93]You soak your feet.
[170:18.77]My old grandmother does that.
[170:20.09]My grandmother soaks her feet.
[170:21.73]Show me.
[170:23.48]Feet.
[170:24.02]Number one.
[170:25.20]Yes!
[170:29.50]Good luck.
[170:30.94]Our number one answer.
[170:33.20]Family number one.
[170:34.24]Or it's going to be laundry.
[170:36.27]Laundry or dishes.
[170:38.27]Let's play this one.
[170:39.01]Laundry, dishes.
[170:40.51]Going to play?
[170:41.35]Let's go.
[170:42.21]Food.
[170:44.05]We'll do dishes.
[170:45.35]Laundry.
[170:46.23]Laundry.
[170:47.01]All right.
[170:47.31]Show me that.
[170:58.52]No, you don't soak laundry, apparently.
[171:00.34]Okay.
[171:00.50]You don't soak laundry.
[171:01.12]Dishes.
[171:01.64]You soak your dishes.
[171:04.60]There it is.
[171:05.70]Dishes.
[171:06.22]Laundry's not it.
[171:26.95]Sponges?
[171:28.17]But like, you don't like... I'll go with... I'll try sponge.
[171:29.91]Hair?
[171:34.33]Body?
[171:34.73]It's either hair or...
[171:50.80]Family number two, one more strike.
[171:52.60]Hair.
[171:52.90]And you get a chance to steal.
[171:54.16]It's gonna be like hair or something.
[171:55.84]Let's try hair.
[171:56.70]What's your guess?
[171:57.96]Sponge.
[171:58.48]Well, I don't know.
[172:00.16]I saw it at one point.
[172:00.88]Oh, no.
[172:01.36]Hair.
[172:01.64]Your hair.
[172:03.08]You soak your hair.
[172:03.82]Is it there?
[172:04.76]Show us.
[172:05.30]What the fuck?
[172:10.55]I gotta give you a strike.
[172:11.75]Next family, you can steal.
[172:13.57]What else would it even be?
[172:15.29]People don't soak their hands.
[172:17.17]Name something that people soak.
[172:19.40]I hope they don't steal this fing... It's not fingers.
[172:24.79]You only do that if you're trying to get somebody to pee their pants in their sleep.
[172:29.31]Yeah, exactly.
[172:30.11]That's how I win.
[172:31.11]Because, like, that's what... You put somebody's hand in water and they pee their pants.
[172:34.21]Okay.
[172:34.83]Beans.
[172:36.08]Teeth.
[172:46.02]I want to be very clear about this with you guys.
[172:48.38]There are four people on this planet Earth that say they soak their teeth.
[172:55.18]They soak their teeth.
[172:56.75]The four people on this fucked up planet Earth soak their teeth.
[172:59.73]Dentures.
[172:59.97]Dentures would make sense, but it wasn't dentures.
[173:03.03]If it said dentures, that would make sense, but it said teeth.
[173:17.47]Dentures are dentures.
[173:18.53]Teeth are teeth.
[173:20.25]Dentures ain't teeth.
[173:21.07]Who was the last person you lied to?
[173:23.07]What do you think it is?
[173:23.87]The last person you lied to.
[173:27.02]It's going to be spouse.
[173:28.38]It's going to be.
[173:29.08]It just is.
[173:30.36]It just is.
[173:31.06]Kim, I haven't lied to you.
[173:32.56]I didn't lie to you, but it's going to be up there.
[173:34.64]It's going to be up there.
[173:35.30]Number one.
[173:35.74]See, I fucking told you.
[173:37.52]That's not who I last lied to.
[173:39.00]It's just that's the answer.
[173:40.98]Our top answer.
[173:41.87]Way to go.
[173:43.63]Family number one.
[173:44.65]Are you going to play or pass?
[173:46.13]I don't know about this.
[173:49.62]They're not going to get these.
[173:51.62]There's way too many answers.
[173:57.03]Why is Paul Bear hosting Family Feud?
[174:02.75]Mother.
[174:03.49]That's going to be up there.
[174:04.79]Yeah, that's fine.
[174:11.10]That's fine.
[174:11.92]That's okay.
[174:12.46]That's okay.
[174:18.31]Next player, what's your guess?
[174:20.77]Who was the last person you lied to?
[174:25.78]Friend.
[174:26.22]That's vague.
[174:27.76]It's okay, though.
[174:30.76]Yeah!
[174:31.52]Good answer!
[174:34.96]These next ones are going to be specific, and they won't get it.
[174:37.73]And even if they do, who cares?
[174:38.73]I'm going to win.
[174:39.21]Good answer!
[174:39.89]Good answer!
[174:43.61]You can hear the director telling him to stop.
[174:46.27]Check this out.
[174:47.50]He goes, stop, stop.
[174:51.08]Listen to the background.
[174:53.46]Next time he does that.
[174:55.49]You can hear him say, like, cut.
[174:58.91]That was your only chance.
[175:00.13]Let's see what the other family can do.
[175:01.57]Oh, shit.
[175:02.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[175:03.05]I have to do it now?
[175:03.63]What do you think it is, family?
[175:04.77]Oh, no.
[175:05.13]I didn't think I had to go.
[175:07.29]Oh, shit.
[175:08.59]Oh, no.
[175:09.05]Oh, no.
[175:09.47]Oh, no.
[175:11.25]Boss.
[175:12.53]Best boss.
[175:16.21]Show me that.
[175:17.96]I didn't think I was... I wasn't prepared for that, but I think it's going to be okay.
[175:21.92]Got it.
[175:25.40]We win.
[175:28.02]Piss.
[175:31.40]Sweetheart.
[175:39.63]Sweetheart.
[175:42.15]Ten people said that.
[175:44.53]My sweetheart.
[175:45.13]What the fuck are you talking about?
[175:46.50]Sweetheart.
[175:50.26]I mean, the Lees are getting their asses kicked.
[175:54.66]And they lost.

[182:39.51]Uh, I mean, well, through the grapevine, I guess people are talking about that.
[182:43.95]If you want to do them, you can do them.
[182:45.47]If not, then it don't matter.
[182:46.87]I don't... I'm not really thinking too deeply on them at this point.
[182:50.41]I want to see what they are for real first.
[182:52.24]So, we'll see when it happens.
[182:54.52]Uh, Dr. Pig.
