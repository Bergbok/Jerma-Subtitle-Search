[00:08.64]Extreme content.
[00:11.69]Yeah, on.
[00:12.39]What is extreme content?
[00:13.67]What does that mean?
[00:15.79]It's not blood or gore.
[00:17.15]Usually they- the blood or gore is a checkbox.
[00:19.29]Watch the first scene of this game.
[00:20.91]There's just gonna be tits everywhere.
[00:23.31]My duty is here.
[00:24.58]As yours is with your men.
[00:26.32]What's your- I asked you a question.
[00:27.90]I asked her to- I don't know.
[00:29.42]I know.
[00:30.64]She told me.
[00:31.46]Roar!
[00:31.92]You're Keegan!
[00:33.30]You're Keegan?! !
[00:37.06]That's the- that's this person's name?
[00:38.46]Yokiken.
[00:39.43]That's- that's something that like, Chun-Li would scream when she shoots a fireball.
[00:42.97]Yokiken!
[00:43.77]Yokiken!
[00:45.47]Holy shit!
[00:54.40]This is so loud!
[00:55.90]This is the loudest thing I've ever experienced!
[00:58.86]There's only one enemy down here!
[01:00.22]Does it seriously have to be this loud?
[01:03.39]I told you he was gonna die.
[01:05.03]10 bucks!
[01:22.21]Is he gonna get run over by a motorcycle too?
[01:24.23]That'd been the best.
[01:25.43]What?!
[01:25.83]What an awful shot.
[01:27.43]And you're not shooting him!
[01:28.49]How is you missing that?
[01:29.59]How did you miss those three shots?
[01:32.33]Shoot him!
[01:33.14]Shoot him!
[01:34.20]He's already gone!
[01:38.14]Star?
[01:39.50]Yes?
[01:39.86]I didn't want to be the first one to say this, but I truly think... I truly think this weird agency is poisoning the water supply.
[01:47.24]Oh no!
[01:51.03]Where is he?
[01:52.11]Breakfast is almost served.
[01:54.05]Honey, I have your favorite Pop-Tarts.
[01:57.77]Pop-Tarts.
[01:59.42]This is the one with the whole game.
[02:02.58]No, you broke it.
[02:03.98]Did you see me try and jump through it?
[02:07.88]You fucking broke it and you messed up the joke.
[02:12.16]Honey, I've got your favorite breakfast snack here waiting for you.
[02:16.82]It's Pop-Tart!
[02:18.26]Pop-Tart!
[02:20.77]It didn't work.
[02:23.71]Honey, you know there's Pop-Tarts down here.
[02:27.21]Huh?
[02:28.05]What?
[02:28.49]Pop-Tarts?
[02:31.93]You fucking idiot.
[02:33.77]Get in there!
[02:35.27]You know, I've got all these breakfast toaster strudel things here.
[02:39.87]They remind me of... I got it in.
[02:49.96]Oh, no, I didn't.
[02:51.28]It's close.
[02:52.82]Alright, it's in.
[02:53.36]I got it in.
[02:54.38]I got it in the house.
[02:55.42]I got it in the house.
[02:57.40]Help me.
[02:59.48]I don't know what to do.
[03:00.68]I'm stuck.
[03:05.25]Well, get off of it.
[03:08.89]Get off of it so we can do this joke.
[03:13.48]I kinda can't, dude.
[03:14.88]I can't.
[03:21.14]Please.
[03:21.48]Alright, I'm gonna get off.
[03:25.52]I'm gonna get off.
[03:26.36]You got into the second floor?
[03:29.46]Honey, I have your favorite breakfast food.
[03:32.00]Watch out!
[03:36.62]Yeah, that was so cool.
[03:39.11]This is lagging so bad.
[03:46.53]This game just got so much better.
[03:48.33]The walls.
[03:49.35]Riding on the walls.
[03:50.35]This is so...
[04:07.16]Oh, I don't think... No, don't go.
[04:10.42]Don't go.
[04:13.83]I'm dead.
[04:14.15]I'm dead.
[04:15.01]Where is he?
[04:15.83]Where is he?
[04:16.51]Oh, I thought I died.
[04:18.79]I was dead.
[04:19.63]I'm, like, gonna... I'm, like, gonna burgably throw up right now.
[04:40.05]What is extreme content?
[04:50.35]What does that mean?
[04:54.22]This was such a boring game, and then they added this to it.
[05:02.34]Oh, you landed on the roof!
[05:04.59]Watch out for this guy.
[05:05.49]I'm gonna die.
[05:08.71]No!
[05:09.97]What?
[05:11.93]I'm dead.
[05:12.41]I'm dead.
[05:15.57]Alright, here's your last chance, honey.
[05:17.93]They're nice and piping hot.
[05:19.39]Pop-tarts!
[05:20.53]Please give me the pop-tarts!
[05:22.05]No!
[05:30.97]Wait, Mom!
[05:31.79]Mom, I need the pop-tarts!
[05:35.86]Hmm, I'm gonna use my superpowers to see where he is.
[05:42.56]Not climbing up.
[05:46.13]This is like on all those movies you watch with, like, the, oh, the school bus is just hanging by a thread.
[05:54.81]I'm stuck perfectly.
[05:55.91]Like, I have no traction.
[05:57.25]You cannot move at all?
[06:02.20]No.
[06:03.86]You cannot move this at all.
[06:04.96]It's like penis motorcycle.
[06:09.07]Oh yeah, sure you can't.
[06:12.01]No, no, hitting the jet booster on the back kind of helps.
[06:15.24]Alright, I'm done.
[06:16.58]I'm out of this fucking game.
