[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.75]What is that?
[00:07.25]Okay, ultimate test.
[00:09.19]Can you see every frame?
[00:13.95]Do you see all those?
[00:15.81]I gotta get the most amount of frame data in one image.
[00:18.71]Okay, we did a bunch of frame data.
[00:20.82]So that means it needs to be like, it has to be like a bunch of stuff flying around.
[00:26.80]This is perfect.
[00:28.75]Cause this is like a bunch of fucking cords and wires and it needs to like a lot of, look at all those pixels, all the individual pixels on the lines that have to be calculated in one second.
[00:40.04]Did you see them all?
[00:46.16]Yeah.
[00:53.28]I think we're good.
[00:57.54]Nice.
[00:59.36]right I think we're ready to play uh true crime streets of new york we're good yeah are we ready are we actually gonna do this whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[01:32.72]Oh, by the way, I figured out who I look like.
[01:36.08]Um, those of you that have seen Gremlins 2, you know the guy that runs the TV station?
[01:42.54]That is identical to who I look like.
[01:45.36]With this haircut and this fucking face.
[01:48.38]Identical to the guy that runs the Gremlins 2 TV station.
[01:52.94]He got the tie and he's like, whoa, those things are crazy!
[01:54.90]Those things are wild!
[01:56.04]It's that guy.
[01:59.48]All the fucking things can't get out of here.
[02:03.62]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[02:04.14]Yeah, good idea.
[02:04.56]I'll get a picture.
[02:07.28]Uh, Gremlins 2 TV Executive.
[02:16.09]No, Gremlins 2... I'll reenact the whole tie scene.
[02:20.27]That sounds like a good idea, right?
[02:25.38]Remlins 2, uh, like, scene.
[02:29.22]The scene where he puts the tie down, and he finally is convinced.
[02:34.08]I gotta reenact the whole thing.
[02:41.80]Remlins 2.
[02:44.84]Uh, the shredder.
[02:46.58]Shredder scene.
[02:48.34]Okay, here it is.
[02:49.10]Lionel Luthor!
[02:49.96]There he is.
[02:50.44]Here he comes.
[02:52.57]I'll try to reenact the whole thing as Lionel Luther.
[02:55.64]So I've got to get this ready.
[02:56.48]Hold on.
[02:56.82]Sorry.
[02:57.04]Give me one second.
[03:02.72]I've got to put on subtitles so I can actually read along too.
[03:12.69]By the way, are you wondering why I'm doing this?
[03:14.49]It's to make sure that it stays green.
[03:18.27]I ain't fucking around right now.
[03:22.68]I'm still looking.
[03:23.46]You might be wondering, why don't you just play the game?
[03:24.86]Because I need to make sure that we're not going to drop any frames.
[03:33.15]Oh, god damn it.
[03:36.49]Who?
[03:36.79]Me?
[03:38.59]Are they talking about me?
[03:40.85]What is happening?
[03:42.53]I have no idea.
[03:43.39]Okay, hold on.
[03:44.19]I've got to make sure I do this right.
[03:45.23]I need subtitles on.
[03:53.31]He has over 170,000 subscribers.
[03:54.81]What the hell are you doing?
[04:01.01]Why am I getting this right now?
[04:03.56]There we go.
[04:03.90]Okay, here we go.
[04:05.68]I gotta close captioning.
[04:09.48]I don't think I can do closed captioning.
[04:13.65]This is gonna be so fucking stupid.
[04:15.67]I'm gonna try.
[04:16.29]I haven't seen this scene in 15 years, 10 years probably.
[04:25.77]Here we go.
[04:28.57]Window capture.
[04:29.45]Let's just get it there.
[04:32.69]Looks good.
[04:33.39]Make sure we gotta get this in the right spot.
[04:42.68]Okay.
[04:45.54]We gotta like spin this around.
[05:00.94]Here we go.
[05:01.28]I'm gonna try it.
[05:05.96]I haven't seen the scene in 15 years.
[05:38.10]Get away with it!
[06:15.67]Yeah, I think so.
[06:19.35]I hate using these machines by myself.
[06:43.81]Oh, wait, that's not allowed.
[06:46.45]Who gives a fuck?
[06:51.53]That was, like, a minute.
[06:53.37]And plus, I was... Hold on a second.
[06:54.77]Wait a minute.
[06:55.39]Wait a minute.
[06:55.99]Wait a minute.
[06:56.41]Before you cry foul here, hold on a second, lawyers in the chat.
[07:03.06]I was changing that.
[07:05.08]I was, on top of that, doing a piece on the piece...
[07:10.67]So therefore, I was artistically changing the original for parody purposes.
[07:17.29]So get the fuck out of here.
[07:26.47]I'm just happy.
[07:32.91]I'm so happy that we can play this now.
[07:37.74]Wait, there were horns in the background this whole time?
[07:46.76]There were car noises the whole time.
[07:50.56]Fuck.
[07:54.48]Nobody was watching my small screen.
[08:03.53]Nuke!
[08:05.51]I'm ready.
[08:09.21]Yeah, New York license plate.
[08:11.77]It only took us a fucking full hour before the stream.
[08:15.70]Hold on a minute.
[08:16.18]I have to move this.
[08:17.34]This is not good.
[08:19.62]You can always tell when I get excited.
[08:21.54]That was me getting excited.
[08:27.58]Okay, license plate is going to be J-E-X.
[08:29.31]Because J-E-X is back.
[08:37.95]How does this look?
[08:43.03]uh how does that look 44 minutes don't get excited well we might lose why did I do that I don't know that was weird saving data yeah don't turn off the memory card save successful are we ready for the opening cutscene yeah I think so oh this is needs to be moved a little bit there we go holy we're gonna get the opening cutscene
[09:13.23]Everybody hold on.
[09:13.83]Wait, I gotta change the Twitch thing.
[09:16.49]Enjoy the cutscene.
[09:17.09]Manhattan Island.
[09:20.79]25 square miles of crowds, concrete, crimes so cold they'd wither the soul and freeze the blood.
[09:30.46]Millions exist here.
[09:32.32]Walking streets that may swallow them whole or spit out their bones.
[09:47.22]When you've been locked away for the better part of 15 years, you've got no choice but to rely on those closest to you to watch out for your interests outside.
[09:55.71]Oh, shit, somebody gave me $100.
[09:57.33]Oh, my fucking god.
[09:58.33]Cigarette spaghetti.
[09:59.23]Thanks for the $100, like, 30 minutes ago.
[10:00.77]Take this and fix your fucking internet.
[10:03.25]You trug your door.
[10:08.23]Frog you.
[10:08.71]I don't know, I can't say that word.
[10:10.29]Thank you so much for the 100 bucks.
[10:13.52]It's a lot of money, man.
[10:16.18]Thank you, Cigarette Spaghetti.
[10:17.02]Am I... Alright, are we ready?
[10:24.28]I'm so excited.
[10:32.08]By the way, this is on the PlayStation 2.
[10:33.48]This is the original PlayStation 2 version.
[10:37.94]This looks pretty blurry.
[10:42.42]Now this is also, Sleeping Dogs is next in line.
[10:50.87]This is the next game in the series, technically.
[10:53.60]I need to change this a little bit.
[10:59.28]Obviously a heavy subject matter here so behave I ain't the only one
[11:25.91]What you talking about, nigga?
[11:27.55]Your boy's fucked up, Cav.
[11:30.47]My pops are still alive.
[11:33.79]Let's go.
[11:38.85]I'm here.
[11:40.54]Kill that fucking Marcus.
[11:47.24]You wait, you wait.
[11:56.09]Dude, do I get to play the game?
[11:59.71]Oh my god, this looks horrible.
[12:04.38]Wow, this is... This is not what I remember it looking like.
[12:07.38]Hold R, aim.
[12:10.98]Hold L1, auto-target.
[12:13.64]And R1 is firing.
[12:19.55]Alright, we're good.
[12:26.42]I feel like I'm playing a Resident Evil 1 right now.
[12:33.21]Like, that's the crap.
[12:37.71]I think it's because it's on PlayStation 2.
[12:41.98]Climb to the window, you got it.
[12:45.54]How do I?
[12:45.90]Oh, L2.
[12:46.24]There we go.
[12:51.14]You missed the 60 FPS.
[12:53.07]I actually couldn't get this to run.
[12:59.67]It's just Hypercam 2.
[13:01.86]Who's this?
[13:03.68]Oh, this is a guy.
[13:04.88]Okay.
[13:13.86]Oh, wow.
[13:14.28]This is snap aiming.
[13:17.40]I remember the days of snap aiming.
[13:18.78]GTA 4.
[13:19.38]You could just go like this.
[13:22.10]Tap.
[13:22.38]I think I can get in the car.
[13:26.36]How do you get in the car?
[13:28.13]No, you can't.
[13:32.34]I can barely even see what's happening.
[13:34.85]I might have to turn the brightness up.
[13:41.11]Where am I getting shot from?
[13:47.29]Oh, there we go.
[13:47.93]All I had to do was press L1 and it showed me where to go.
[13:59.18]That's so difficult.
[14:01.41]You just have to tap L1.
[14:03.17]My kind of game.
[14:04.41]You just have to press L1.
[14:05.63]Alright, turn up the brightness.
[14:08.67]How do I turn the brightness up?
[14:10.59]That's a good question.
[14:13.17]That's not how you do it.
[14:15.37]I was trying to hit the pause menu.
[14:24.15]Five years later.
[14:25.16]On the fourth.
[14:27.18]That's crazy, ain't it?
[14:28.91]Don't they always have, like, celebrities in here?
[14:30.64]I skipped five years.
[14:31.64]I didn't... I just pressed the... I pressed the button.
[15:01.60]Oh, there's J. John Jameson from Spider-Man.
[15:04.16]Did you get the photo of Spider-Man yet?
[15:06.75]You got it, Vic.
[15:08.49]Sure.
[15:28.99]This is the same as, uh, what's the same game?
[15:31.21]That was, that was, I liked that little end there.
[15:43.00]Well, Akinator, it sure did change.
[15:44.78]Alright.
[15:45.90]Alright.
[15:46.34]Hold on.
[15:46.88]Can I do this?
[15:47.92]Is there... Select melee or hand-to-hand mode?
[15:59.76]Hold on a minute.
[16:00.76]Is there a... Hold on.
[16:06.77]Game completion.
[16:08.29]Career.
[16:10.21]Evidence.
[16:11.65]Case select.
[16:13.91]Is there a... Music player.
[16:18.35]I turned all the music off, by the way, because I don't want to get this whole stream turned off.
[16:23.98]Here we go.
[16:24.32]Options.
[16:25.12]No brightness or anything?
[16:26.26]Shit.
[16:27.36]Shit.
[16:28.69]Yeah, display widescreen on.
[16:31.03]No.
[16:32.93]I think I can, I may be able to do it through here.
[16:34.33]Let me try to turn it up through here.
[16:36.43]All right.
[16:37.55]Pray.
[16:38.69]Pray that this doesn't just turn off.
[16:42.63]Okay.
[16:43.87]Wait a minute.
[16:45.13]Oh, wait just a second here, folks.
[16:48.39]I got it.
[16:51.15]That's a little bit better.
[16:54.57]I would say.
[16:58.05]Because that's where it was.
[16:59.19]This is it now.
[16:59.85]Okay, that's better.
[17:02.45]Hey, look at you guys.
[17:04.09]Can't you see?
[17:08.24]Nice and happy.
[17:11.52]Still really ugly.
[17:15.04]That's very ugly, but it's okay.
[17:17.60]Alright, light attacks are fast but weak.
[17:19.74]Press X for light attack.
[17:26.10]That seems not, that seems very strong.
[17:28.53]And we're dropping frames again.
[17:29.75]I'm about to fucking punch the screen.
[17:34.27]Progressive scan?
[17:35.17]I cannot do progressive scan because I'm capping my PlayStation through, through a separate device and it does not, it can't work.
[17:44.31]If I try, I tried that before the screen started.
[17:46.12]Okay.
[17:49.54]Heavy attacks.
[17:50.00]The slope is strong.
[17:50.64]Press square for a strong attack.
[17:52.52]Nice.
[17:58.28]Perform radial attack together.
[18:00.34]Oh wow, that is such a haymaker.
[18:07.52]I can't wait to do that to somebody just in the face.
[18:13.98]This is one of the best games ever.
[18:15.74]There's a haymaker.
[18:17.66]I wish I could do that more than once.
[18:29.24]Okay.
[18:32.49]Perform ground attack.
[18:33.57]Dude, this haymakers are the best.
[18:35.67]Next area.
[18:36.93]This way.
[18:38.35]Punch the car.
[18:39.39]Mm-hmm.
[18:59.51]Perform grapple.
[19:01.93]Press X or square for takedown or again to shove.
[19:10.07]There's a lot of material here.
[19:12.75]You know this game is going to have a lot of material.
[19:16.05]It's going to be great.
[19:19.87]Sneak grapple.
[19:20.82]Okay, the stealth.
[19:21.74]Okay.
[19:29.47]Bad cop or good cop?
[19:31.33]Wait, this is just a guy in the training area.
[19:35.22]That was just a guy dressed up in one of those dog outfits to get bit by the training dog.
[19:43.47]I just killed him.
[19:45.01]Okay.
[19:53.58]We're dropping frames again.
[19:54.70]I really don't want to start this.
[19:56.84]There's a lot going on here.
[19:57.96]There's a lot of material in this game.
[19:59.86]I don't want it to be a... Yeah, and we waited like an hour.
[20:12.18]God damn it.
[20:13.72]Back to Akinator.
[20:14.84]Fuck you, bitch!
[20:23.41]Do you see how good this game is going to be?
[20:25.51]This needs to be at 100% frames.
[20:27.31]It just does.
[20:30.09]And you can spear people.
[20:34.32]Oh, there's going to be so much fun shit to do here.
[20:44.54]I like it already.
[20:50.75]Grab and then I'm going to just go like this.
[21:00.40]Block.
[21:00.78]I like the fighting in this one better than the last one.
[21:05.45]The last one, you went like weird 3D, 2D plane.
[21:08.35]It was odd.
[21:18.23]Okay, I killed somebody in the training.
[21:20.89]Okay, that's fine.
[21:30.01]Mm-hmm.
[21:30.65]Gun mode.
[21:31.23]R1 to fire.
[21:48.60]I'm dropping more frames, aren't I?
[21:50.97]Damn it!
[21:51.71]Why?
[21:52.11]I thought we had it.
[21:54.23]I really do.
[21:57.45]Wall hug.
[21:58.39]How do you hug the wall?
[21:59.59]That's rude.
[22:20.25]Yeah, it's just not, it's just not looking, it's just not looking good.
[22:31.96]Oh, this gun dives?
[22:33.22]Are you kidding me?
[22:36.29]Oh my god, there's so much, look at the fun this is gonna be.
[22:40.75]Um.
[22:51.12]I'm going to make an executive decision here.
[22:56.49]We're going to do this again.
[23:02.69]Unfortunately, I can't.
[23:05.77]I don't want to play it like this.
[23:06.67]I feel like this is going to be one of those games that's going to be a lot of fun, and I would not want it to be subpar quality.
[23:17.24]So...
[23:19.54]Here's what's gonna happen.
[23:20.22]There's grenades.
[23:22.34]Those grenades are live, son.
[23:24.82]You know what to do with them.
[23:26.84]There's so much in the game and we haven't even got outside yet.
[23:29.64]This is gonna be awesome.
[23:41.11]Just like back in NAMM.
[23:43.07]I can almost smell the napalm.
[23:50.07]Precise aim is R3.
[23:51.85]Oh wow, that's cool.
[23:53.35]Hold on, I'm going to shoot the civilian first.
[23:57.66]Hydration?
[23:58.68]No, more like scream.
[24:16.40]Sensitivity is really odd, too.
[24:18.86]Like, I can't just do a small movement.
[24:20.44]I have to change that.
[24:22.68]Because, like, literally just... I'm pressing it as gently as I can, and it goes that far.
[24:28.32]That's got to be...
[24:51.35]Unnecessary, but fun.
[24:54.73]Every time you miss, you hit the frames.
[25:00.37]In fact, you know what?
[25:01.17]I'm going to go a step further on this one.
[25:03.83]I'm going to try... I'm going to get this on PC.
[25:06.05]Is this one on PC?
[25:07.71]I had trouble trying to get the last one to work on PC, but I think I'm willing to make an actual massive effort here.
[25:17.96]Nice shooting, officer.
[25:19.72]You pass with flying fucking colors.
[25:22.82]Happy?
[25:26.16]Yeah, it's not getting better.
[25:28.76]We've been sitting here for an hour.
[25:30.06]I don't want to waste anybody's time.
[25:32.30]There's a car.
[25:34.58]We can't do this fun stuff yet.
[25:36.16]Okay, step on the gas and get rolling.
[25:40.41]God damn it, this is going to be so much fun.
[25:49.91]Yeah, that's it.
[25:53.07]Massive effort by buying it for $15 on Steam.
[25:55.91]It's on Steam?
[25:58.62]No, it's not.
[25:59.94]This is on Steam?
[26:07.16]No, it is not.
[26:15.51]It's not on Steam.
[26:16.39]I'm looking it up right now.
[26:20.95]This game's not on Steam.
[26:25.99]Sleeping Dogs is the sequel to this game.
[26:28.97]Oh, I just got bejaded.
[26:29.95]Okay, whatever.
[26:31.65]Um, yeah.
[26:33.13]Unfortunately, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna continue to play this.
[26:37.74]This is a great, fun game we can play.
[26:40.56]Ugh.
[26:48.78]Yeah, I have to actually buy it on Amazon and get it to work.
[26:59.20]Back in the red on frames here.
[27:12.63]Well, I'm sorry, guys.
[27:14.75]Tried.
[27:15.37]Spending more time in the menu than playing it.
[27:17.67]There's nothing I can do.
[27:18.97]Well, I'm almost at 40,000 frames dropped.
[27:21.43]Let me do another... I want to do another test here.
[27:24.90]Hold on.
[27:27.24]Hopefully I get this figured out by tomorrow because tomorrow is... I'm playing with Kryken.
[27:31.32]Me and Kryken and his group of friends and everybody.
[27:34.45]We're going to be playing Sub Rosa.
[27:37.31]So I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure this fucking works tomorrow.
[27:41.23]Because that's going to be a lot of fun.
[27:42.61]This was supposed to be a lot of fun too.
[27:44.11]God damn it.
[28:01.83]I'm testing something else here.
