[00:22.88]Class.
[00:24.40]Warrior.
[00:25.91]Knight.
[00:27.27]Are they all different stats?
[00:28.29]I probably should be looking at that.
[00:30.25]You know, whatever.
[00:31.79]Hunter.
[00:32.81]Sorcerer.
[00:33.71]Pyromancer.
[00:35.07]Cleric.
[00:39.32]What?
[00:41.06]What?
[00:41.76]Hold on.
[00:42.58]All these guys have, like, armor and, like, clothing and stuff.
[00:44.86]Why does this guy only have, like, underwear on?
[00:47.48]This guy's... What the hell is this guy?
[00:49.28]Alright, we'll go with this guy.
[00:51.41]Give... I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[00:57.57]What the hell?
[01:01.13]Alright, well, good thing... Good thing I look like a dipshit.
[01:03.90]I'm happy about this.
[01:07.88]Oh, my word.
[01:10.11]Is there anything else I can do?
[01:11.15]My guy looks like a fucking idiot.
[01:17.44]Hey.
[01:21.10]What's up, man?
[01:23.08]How's that wall looking?
[01:24.92]Looking good enough for this?
[01:29.06]Dark Souls is so hard.
[01:33.24]Left stick and hold down.
[01:34.79]Alright, like that.
[01:36.01]Wahoo!
[01:38.83]Yahoo!
[01:42.39]Target lock release.
[01:44.29]Ooh, alright.
[01:44.81]Alright.
[01:45.63]Okay.
[01:48.97]Hey, buddy.
[01:51.17]So that's a weak attack.
[01:52.59]This is like a strong attack.
[01:55.41]Good to go.
[01:55.79]What am I using for a weapon?
[01:56.73]What is this?
[01:58.65]Am I using like a popsicle stick for a sword?
[02:00.45]What the f- Honey, I'm home!
[02:05.11]What's for dinner?
[02:05.97]Are we gonna have lobsters tonight?
[02:09.56]Haha!
[02:12.05]Read the message.
[02:13.11]Whoa!
[02:15.15]Oh my god, that's a big boy.
[02:17.49]Just go ahead and stand here and watch him while he smashes you.
[02:20.81]What is this, Magtheridon from Warcraft?
[02:23.82]I gotta get the hell out of here.
[02:25.92]Wait, do I have to fight him?
[02:27.42]I don't know.
[02:28.06]Just go.
[02:28.52]Run this way.
[02:29.50]No, not this way.
[02:30.16]What am I doing?
[02:31.30]Oh my god, I'm an idiot.
[02:34.26]Oh, an exit.
[02:35.08]An exit.
[02:36.99]Woohoo!
[02:38.75]Yeah, what you got on me?
[02:40.41]Nothing.
[02:41.35]You pricked.
[02:48.43]Ouch.
[02:54.47]Ouch.
[03:00.85]I didn't even pay attention to any of that.
[03:03.21]I was too busy laughing at my stupid jump.
[03:05.44]Yes, I'll do it, sure.
[03:06.56]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:10.20]Yeah.
[03:14.18]Yeah, screw your family.
[03:15.78]Can I just shut this guy up?
[03:17.22]Can I kick this guy?
[03:18.34]Oh!
[03:19.18]Oh my god!
[03:19.78]Oh!
[03:21.74]Oh!
[03:23.08]Oh, I didn't know you could do that!
[03:25.60]I didn't know you could do that!
[03:28.07]Oh no!
[03:28.59]Was I... Was I not supposed to do that?
[03:34.37]Sorry!
[03:36.99]Wield right weapon two-handed.
[03:40.43]Oh, I can use this as a two-hander?
[03:42.25]Oh, great.
[03:42.75]Yeah, let me use it.
[03:43.69]Get, dude!
[03:44.69]You know what?
[03:45.37]Seriously, get the hell out of here.
[03:49.00]We're fighting in a stupid hallway.
[03:50.90]I can't even swing my sword.
[03:55.36]Seriously, you are so annoying.
[03:58.10]I should have just gotten rid of you when I had the chance.
[04:04.72]This is the lamest fight ever.
[04:06.45]No, don't kill me.
[04:07.97]I'm just gonna go this way.
[04:08.91]Screw you.
[04:10.62]Wrestling and bon- Where's the bonfire?
[04:12.50]Where's the- Oh, it revives enemies too.
[04:14.66]Oh, shit.
[04:16.88]Oh.
[04:18.40]God, I don't- No, what- I can't- Why can't I attack?
[04:23.18]What the fuck is going on?
[04:24.74]Oh, to get me out of the menu.
[04:25.98]There we go.
[04:32.69]Not gonna be an idiot.
[04:34.69]Oh, that does so much more damage.
[04:36.79]That's so much better.
[04:39.67]Oh, this game just became so much easier.
[04:44.14]Holy sh- Come on!
[04:45.50]No!
[04:46.44]Dude!
[04:47.86]No!
[04:50.10]I'm getting chased.
[04:52.10]I'm getting chased.
[04:52.92]I don't even know what this does, but I'm drinking it.
[05:00.32]What does that even do?
[05:01.00]I can't even do it.
[05:04.92]You can't get me while I'm jumping.
[05:06.50]No, I want my shield back.
[05:08.44]I like the shield better.
[05:09.78]Oh my... I wasn't even locking on to enemies.
[05:13.82]I was just flailing around like an idiot.
[05:18.31]Give me my lost power.
[05:20.27]And this time, we're going to do lock-ons.
[05:23.79]Because it's going to be way much easier that way.
[05:26.09]That was a double hit.
[05:27.51]You like the double cheeseburger hit?
[05:29.80]Yeah, you do.
[05:31.66]That's a clat right there.
[05:34.89]Come on, shoot it.
[05:35.67]Shoot it.
[05:37.47]Did I block it?
[05:37.97]I did.
[05:38.29]Good.
[05:40.69]Critical hit from behind.
[05:41.81]Oh, it didn't even work.
[05:42.37]Let's get behind this guy.
[05:43.09]Come on!
[05:44.35]There it is.
[05:45.99]Oh, how's your back?
[05:49.23]Now this guy... This guy is dead.
[05:52.29]Alright, buddy?
[05:53.35]I'm prepared.
[05:54.01]I played for a little bit.
[05:55.17]I know how the game works.
[05:56.63]Let's go!
[05:57.13]Yeah!
[05:59.80]Get locked on.
[06:00.64]Come on.
[06:01.32]You want me to do a little dance?
[06:02.82]Oh, dance, baby.
[06:05.34]That hurts still.
[06:06.00]It's alright.
[06:06.42]We're good.
[06:06.76]Yeah, what you got?
[06:08.88]You ain't got nothing.
[06:11.90]Hey, look.
[06:12.32]I learned how to play the game.
[06:14.45]It only took me like 25 minutes.
[06:18.23]Hi.
[06:19.97]This guy.
[06:21.43]Look at this guy.
[06:22.21]Look at how eager this... Holy shit!
[06:24.87]Oh my god!
[06:30.70]No, dude, come on!
[06:33.40]I was trying to make a joke about what he looked like and he just... Let's go, you big ugly bitch.
[06:44.73]Let's go, let's go.
[06:46.05]Oh, lord!
[06:48.73]Get smashed!
[06:50.43]Whoa, whoa!
[06:56.33]Can I break these?
[06:57.49]Maybe if he breaks these things, I get, like, items of health or something.
[07:00.38]Oh, he's stuck.
[07:02.50]Get away from me!
[07:07.66]Can I punch him in, like, his bum?
[07:10.10]I'll hit him in, like, his thigh, his leg thigh.
[07:12.84]That didn't make any sense, but I'm gonna beat him.
[07:15.16]Holy!
[07:15.46]Oh, I thought he was gonna belly flop me.
[07:17.12]He is gonna belly flop me!
[07:20.89]No.
[07:21.15]How do I drink these flasks?
[07:23.23]How do I drink a damn flask?
[07:26.41]Escape!
[07:27.27]Dodge through his stomach!
[07:30.39]Alright, I need to figure out how to drink this stuff.
[07:33.32]Recover lost power.
[07:34.30]Take it.
[07:36.48]Is this like a potion?
[07:37.54]Like a healing potion?
[07:39.30]Where's my shield?
[07:40.06]I didn't even have my shield.
[07:42.78]No, put it back on.
[07:44.62]Um... Hold on, time out.
[07:46.63]There is no time out.
[07:47.89]There is no time out.
[07:49.51]You can't pause it.
[07:56.09]I'm hitting him right in his butthole.
[07:59.73]Wow.
[08:00.31]The butthole technique is going to work.
[08:03.54]I can't believe my butthole technique is going to work.
[08:08.44]This is working.
[08:09.26]I can't believe it.
[08:11.88]Oh, God.
[08:14.88]Give me the kill.
[08:15.96]Yes.
[08:16.94]Yeah.
[08:19.14]Yeah.
[08:20.16]Victory is achieved.
[08:22.56]Yeah.
[08:24.62]Oh, yeah.
[08:24.98]That was...
[08:26.49]Pretty ridiculous, but yeah!
[08:28.62]Oh yeah!
[08:30.08]Muscle Man Widow, to the rescue!
[08:34.57]This game's hard.
