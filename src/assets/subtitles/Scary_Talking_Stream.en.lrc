[00:01.41]Hi, guys.
[00:05.16]Throw, throw, throw.
[00:06.72]Get the rocks out of here.
[00:07.66]No rocks today.
[00:08.80]This is supposed to be a chill-out, hang-out, veg-out stream.
[00:14.34]That means when you, like, eat a shitload of vegetables, right?
[00:16.24]When you're a bodybuilder.
[00:20.34]You don't understand.
[00:21.20]The reason why it took me, like, 20 minutes or so, I got carrots, I've got tomatoes, I've got some fresh, mmm, some fresh garden roots all sitting right here.
[00:37.20]My coffee's still too hot to drink.
[00:38.94]Why?
[00:40.41]I hate when that happens.
[00:43.63]What am I going to do?
[00:44.17]A cooking spring?
[00:46.57]That you'll... Maybe.
[00:49.37]But today, we're going to do something a little different.
[00:51.53]We're going to do something a little different today.
[00:54.97]We're going to hang out and have a little fun.
[00:58.70]We're going to just wait for the plane.
[01:07.74]Okay.
[01:08.82]Uh, we're gonna, uh, yeah, that's a nice scripted joke.
[01:14.26]Uh, because I've been doing some more intense video games for the last three or four streams, besides Viscera, but that was intense too.
[01:23.59]Uh, today, we're just gonna sit here like this.
[01:26.43]I'm sorry, like this.
[01:29.86]Hi, welcome to an in-real-life stream, where I sit here, I drink coffee, and we talk about topics, you know what I mean?
[01:38.36]I'm not going to shave, I'm not doing it.
[01:43.48]You know, what topic are we going to talk about today?
[01:46.67]I think we're going to talk about, what's the current state of Magicka Wizard Wars?
[01:58.09]What's the current state of that game?
[02:00.38]Does it even still fucking exist?
[02:05.05]I got this free mouse pad in 2012.
[02:08.45]And I've never not used another mouse pad.
[02:15.84]I'm also a little tired today.
[02:20.16]Your audio sounds bad.
[02:22.74]Wait.
[02:26.63]We got some fun things to try today.
[02:29.47]In our IRL stream.
[02:34.66]Now that I pulled that out, I just fucked up my whole desk.
[02:38.78]Kenshi won the poll.
[02:39.90]I'm probably going to play Kenshi.
[02:41.80]We need to start.
[02:42.68]I need to just relax for a little bit, okay?
[02:44.86]Just chill out.
[02:47.86]Why do I have villain hair?
[02:49.89]Because I just do.
[02:50.99]I have to accept it at some point that I'm a fucking bad guy, right?
[02:57.61]You can't be a good guy with this kind of hair drinking out of this kind of cup.
[03:01.56]Like, this is a bad guy sitting here.
[03:09.91]Anyways, give me one second.
[03:12.73]I wanted to try something today.
[03:14.01]Because I have this thing.
[03:15.34]I know the audio doesn't sound very good, but that's for very specific reasons.
[03:19.22]Because the voice changer is currently... As you can see, it turned the fuck off.
[03:23.96]I have a bunch of different presets here that probably sound a little fucking strange.
[03:32.79]I want to do this a bit.
[03:34.25]There's a bit coming up.
[03:37.39]If you're curious.
[03:43.40]The thing is, I don't know what this sounds like.
[03:45.12]Oh, it sounds like this.
[03:46.54]That sounds fucking horrible.
[03:49.12]Ow!
[03:52.83]What is this one?
[03:54.65]Hello?
[03:57.57]I don't know what this is supposed to be for.
[04:03.53]This is called Romantic Tarot.
[04:10.16]I think this is just background noise.
[04:13.40]Yeah, I don't think that does anything.
[04:17.83]But yeah, welcome.
[04:18.93]How many, how many, how many, do I have chat in the right place?
[04:22.85]No, chat's in the wrong place today.
[04:24.19]I forgot.
[04:28.03]Does it do a date?
[04:31.11]Can I have two going at once?
[04:32.57]No, we're not doing a fucking virtual date.
[04:39.98]I want to do a singing stream where I put, I was gonna get an elaborate costume, I didn't have any time though, and turn on this and sing and like put like a button, like fuck up the video for a little bit and pretend like this is a real singing stream and have people come in and yell at me that I have a like auto-tune on.
[05:02.56]What is sword?
[05:05.30]Sword.
[05:07.38]I, oh it's because it's,
[05:13.54]lightsaber sound.
[05:15.17]But is it really though?
[05:20.05]It's called zombie.
[05:21.49]Zombie.
[05:25.33]Sing with the song.
[05:31.07]This is not even the right post.
[05:37.18]You're layering?
[05:45.49]Let me tell you guys something.
[05:47.17]This is this kind of stream where we talk about topics.
[05:51.35]And I mean, like, Jesus.
[05:54.23]Crap.
[05:55.03]What is going on in the industry right now?
[05:57.39]You've got Blizzard is acting all crazy.
[05:59.74]The Diablo Immortal.
[06:01.44]What the heck is that?
[06:02.86]What the heck is going on here?
[06:04.30]Is that loud?
[06:08.70]Loud.
[06:12.01]I really can't understand a single thing you're saying.
[06:15.19]Should I speak slower?
[06:16.37]Wait a minute.
[06:18.17]God damn it, I have to do this now.
[06:24.27]Is this gonna be possible?
[06:29.57]They're layered?
[06:31.43]Hold on, I'm gonna try to speak from the closet in there.
[06:35.77]As the monster in your closet, go talk about politics.
[06:41.86]I'm gonna get in there and be the monster in the closet, talking about politics.
[06:45.63]We're gonna have scary music.
[06:49.79]Hold on.
[06:53.80]Is there ambience with this one?
[06:56.34]Hold on.
[06:56.98]Let me see.
[06:58.54]What the fuck is going on?
[07:04.03]Can you guys hear- can you hear me now?
[07:06.77]Does this sound normal?
[07:12.90]I should sound completely normal now.
[07:18.70]I'm doubled.
[07:23.30]Wait.
[07:23.94]Oh, okay.
[07:24.42]Now I should sound normal.
[07:26.71]Do I sound?
[07:27.31]There we go.
[07:27.83]Okay.
[07:28.49]So if you didn't catch the thing I said, I'm going to go in the closet there with that voice on and just start talking about, like, fucking politics.
[07:38.09]And be like Monster in Closet stream, like, sleep tight!
[07:42.71]Uh... Stix Renegade just gave $50.
[07:49.21]Thank you so much, Stix, for the 50 bucks.
[07:52.00]And I just gotta tell you... Uh... Thank you so much.
[07:57.42]You say, hey, Jeremy, remember that, uh...
[08:00.77]No, I don't want that to be on.
[08:03.63]That's probably not something I should have on because this is a big fucking money donation.
[08:07.68]I don't want to like fucking mock it or anything.
[08:10.14]You know what I mean?
[08:11.72]Thank you for the $50 though, for real.
[08:13.52]Hey, German, remember that abscess surgery I had thanks to Crohn's disease?
[08:17.52]Well, I just found out the hospital didn't destroy my wallet.
[08:20.95]Insurance saved me 98% of almost 10 grand.
[08:25.01]So since I'm not broke, I'll give some of those savings to you for being the best content creator ever.
[08:31.53]Fear of a heart.
[08:33.01]Best content creator ever.
[08:34.21]I can't even... Thank you, man.
[08:35.87]Like, that's... I'm really, really happy to hear that you didn't have to spend a shitload of money to fix something that your body decided to do on its own.
[08:47.70]So, thank you so much.
[08:50.10]Swift.
[08:51.44]Swift recovery.
[08:55.47]Thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.
[09:01.60]The voice is crackling.
[09:02.65]It's probably because I have too much going on.
[09:04.69]Let me test it out.
[09:06.15]Voice crackling.
[09:06.93]Crackling.
[09:07.49]Crackling.
[09:09.07]Is it?
[09:09.27]I don't know.
[09:13.43]Probably have to mess with some settings.
[09:16.96]I was going to do IRL today.
[09:18.54]I'm not even paying attention to anything else that's going on over here.
[09:21.50]Because I forgot.
[09:22.56]Did my title correct?
[09:24.54]I did my hair so fast.
[09:27.45]It doesn't even look that good.
[09:28.61]The lights are all wrong.
[09:30.44]But I want to just hang out today.
[09:33.94]Speaking of lights, I can brighten it up a little bit in here.
[09:40.87]Where's my mouse?
[09:42.61]Because I like to do little IRL streams sometimes.
[09:46.78]We just stick around and do nothing.
[09:49.06]You know, it's fun.
[09:50.90]Sometimes you just want to do that.
[09:55.00]And we'll probably end up.
[09:57.10]I'm not going to sit here for six hours doing this.
[10:00.94]We'll probably end up going to Kenshi or... What's the other one?
[10:12.07]I have an uneven receding hairline.
[10:14.51]No, it's pretty even.
[10:15.93]It's just over here because my hair is pushed this way.
[10:20.28]So, like, see?
[10:22.40]Yeah, the hair is, like, my hair is, like, combed this way.
[10:25.40]So it's actually, like, here, but it just looks that way because it's combed that way.
[10:36.51]Simpsons 100% run.
[10:37.59]Well, hold on.
[10:38.01]First things first.
[10:38.63]I gotta get my goddamn... I gotta check my words with friends.
[10:45.93]Onomatopoeia!
[10:46.98]That's a triple word score!
[10:48.24]Uh, I need to change the lights a little bit.
[10:59.32]Why do I give a shit if you can see the screen or not?
[11:01.58]I don't understand.
[11:03.36]That's, like, not a big deal.
[11:04.53]I don't know, there's nothing on here that's, like, that important.
[11:08.47]I'm like, wait a minute, like...
[11:16.72]Where is it?
[11:19.88]There it is.
[11:20.18]I'll try to change this a little.
[11:24.09]Because this needs to be a little bit brighter.
[11:26.25]It's not bright enough for me.
[11:29.55]I need more brightness.
[11:40.79]Mmm...
[11:45.83]I don't know.
[11:46.21]I think, okay.
[11:48.03]I'll do this in chat.
[11:49.71]Because I'm going to go in there and I'm going to hang out in there and be in chat.
[11:52.37]And just... Talk.
[11:55.35]And then I'm going to open the fucking door in like five minutes.
[11:58.49]And people are just going to be... Just pretend like I didn't start the stream yet.
[12:04.25]Please fix the crackles.
[12:07.31]Did I fix it?
[12:08.99]Is that fixing crackles?
[12:10.82]Is it still crackling?
[12:12.06]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[12:13.18]Yo, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[12:14.86]Oh, oh.
[12:17.81]Fixed?
[12:19.39]Okay, good.
[12:20.52]So.
[12:22.24]Just give me a second.
[12:22.80]Well, I'm gonna go in the chat and just hang out for like five minutes.
[12:27.76]So, I'm just gonna be in there.
[12:28.76]Let me just do like, yeah.
[12:37.37]Alright, just give me a second.
[12:41.97]I have to go to my own stream.
[12:43.15]I forgot about that.
[12:44.13]I got like fucking weird pants on too, man.
[13:46.93]That's enough of that.
[13:49.43]I'm done with that.
[13:58.76]That was practice for later.
[14:02.34]Because I'm going to draw.
[14:02.96]I'm going to make it red.
[14:03.70]Wow, that was really funny.
[14:09.63]I thought in my head it played out a little funnier.
[14:15.37]Scared of the dark?
[14:16.41]No, I was just in there.
[14:17.45]I can't be scared of the dark if I'm just sitting in there.
[14:20.47]Beer me user name.
[14:24.81]Beer me a user name.
[14:26.23]Just gave five community subs.
[14:27.50]Thanks a lot, Beer.
[14:30.18]He faced his fear.
[14:34.62]He can't stand chat that much.
[14:38.58]That's not true.
[14:40.02]That's completely untrue.
[14:43.34]We're still crackling?
[14:45.04]What the fuck is happening?
[14:46.12]Hold on.
[14:47.19]I'm crackling.
[14:48.31]Why would it be crackling?
[14:52.93]I'm listening to it.
[14:54.01]Hold on.
[14:55.39]Is it crackling right now?
[14:57.67]Like when you hear it through here?
[15:05.14]It's not, right?
[15:08.06]So what the heck is going on here?
[15:14.26]It's just, well, the voice changer's on right now.
[15:16.59]You know what I mean?
[15:18.77]It's on right now.
[15:23.75]He listened to one guy.
[15:26.81]Oh.
[15:37.07]Turn up the game.
[15:43.29]I unplugged something from my neck right now?
[15:44.68]I did not, I did no such thing.
[15:49.90]Did it voice change that guy driving by?
[15:53.80]Oh shit, it's still on the weird one.
[15:56.70]Alright, so here's what we're gonna do.
[15:58.96]I wanna try this.
[15:59.54]Let's set it up.
[16:04.05]Here we go.
[16:34.03]I wonder how this is actually gonna sound.
[16:36.67]Now let's get the, uh... This might be very embarrassing.
[16:45.38]I gotta make sure the voice changer is on and working as fucking intended.
[16:51.74]No, don't worry, we're gonna do Demon in the Closet.
[16:53.86]This is gonna be a lot.
[16:56.28]I was just hanging out for a minute.
[17:00.19]It isn't already?
[17:04.66]We can just reverse voice change it.
[17:06.36]No, you can't.
[17:07.06]Only like three people in here know how to do that.
[17:11.18]Do you know how to do that?
[17:16.93]You know how to do that.
[17:18.09]There's people in here who know how to do that.
[17:24.77]I gotta be careful then.
[17:28.98]Alright, so.
[17:30.96]Let's get it ambient in here.
[17:46.83]It's still crackling.
[17:49.97]Here's what I'm gonna do about that.
[17:51.15]Here's what's gonna happen.
[17:51.93]Ready?
[17:56.21]I'm gonna turn off.
[17:59.01]I'm turning this off.
[18:01.29]Does that sound any better?
[18:02.15]Is it still happening?
[18:06.38]Tell me if it's still happening.
[18:10.40]Because that's the only other outlier as to why that would be happening.
[18:19.11]Because I had a compressor on.
[18:20.59]Maybe the compressor was, like, was fucking with it.
[18:27.09]So, let's, uh... Still happening?
[18:33.29]Probably a loose mic.
[18:34.23]No, it's nothing to do with the mic.
[18:35.71]It's to do with the software pulling through.
[18:37.05]But I had this running during the Christmas stream, and it wasn't a problem.
[18:39.25]So, I don't understand.
[18:40.15]Why the fuck did, like, 1,500 people just show up in a second?
[18:44.23]What happened?
[18:47.14]They were like 3,500 people and it was like 5,000.
[18:49.02]Did I just get, did I just get rated by Dr. Phil?
[18:58.67]Nice.
[19:03.13]Got rated.
[19:03.89]Well, welcome, hey, welcome to the setup of the joke that's not gonna pay off.
[19:10.23]Rated by Robaz.
[19:12.83]Oh, well, fuck yeah, what's up?
[19:15.59]That's like two raids in a row, two streams in a row.
[19:19.71]Of like two or three thousand people.
[19:22.55]Damn.
[19:24.41]Well, thank you, welcome guys.
[19:26.99]What's that?
[19:29.69]What just happened?
[19:36.11]Oh, it's an emote.
[19:37.39]I thought something was wrong.
[19:41.84]One mod spam.
[19:44.28]Turn up your mic.
[19:45.44]I'm so scared about the crackles!
[19:46.86]Okay, here we go.
[19:48.78]I gotta hear these first to make sure they- Has it been like this the whole time?
[19:53.06]Why has it been on this?!
[19:56.26]That's not what I wanted it- Oh my fucking god.
[19:58.67]Uhhhh... Crackles have kind of fucked this whole thing up, aren't they?
[20:13.91]Is it crackling now, during this one, this particular one?
[20:17.25]Because that would be a pain in the ass if it is.
[20:22.03]Yes, what the fuck?
[20:27.71]I don't get it.
[20:32.56]Let me try something here real quick.
[20:34.30]Give me a second, I'm going to reboot this whole thing.
[20:36.16]Not the screen, like this program.
[20:38.04]I'm going to mute everything just to fill.
[20:58.64]So, it should not be happening now.
[21:01.64]Are we still, are we cracking?
[21:03.46]It shouldn't be at all.
[21:06.78]No, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[21:08.54]Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[21:12.08]Right?
[21:17.13]It's because of, god damn it!
[21:20.96]Okay.
[21:21.78]Hi, guys.
[21:22.46]Welcome, everybody.
[21:23.30]Now the mic should work fucking properly because this is the mic that's actually plugged in over here.
[21:27.56]First time singing on stream, by the way.
[21:30.35]Now that that's settled, we're fine.
[21:32.29]There's no crackles.
[21:35.15]A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, Y, V, W, X, Y, and Z, right?
[21:42.70]We're fine.
[21:44.48]Everything sounds good.
[21:48.38]Now, hold on.
[22:08.64]No.
[22:10.54]How do we sound down?
[22:13.88]I just rebooted it all?
[22:18.60]I know it's a little quiet, but can we crack it?
[22:24.00]That's the problem.
[22:29.20]No, no cracking, no cracking, cracking, no cracking.
[22:34.84]I know the reverb is on because it's on this church one.
[22:38.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[22:40.37]You ready?
[22:41.17]You ready for this?
[22:43.69]I need to have, like, a karaoke website.
[22:44.81]Let's go to... I need to make sure I know what this sounds like.
[22:54.61]Hey.
[22:56.71]Hello?
[22:57.83]Ay, ay, ayyyyy. A a a a.
[23:06.94]That's doing it, right?
[23:12.94]Sans voice.
[23:13.94]It's no auto-tune?
[23:20.69]This should be auto-tune on this.
[23:26.11]Is it not auto-tune?
[23:29.93]I think it should be.
[23:30.75]I'm just going to go with it.
[23:32.29]So we got auto-tune.
[23:35.54]Changing our voice to sound good.
[23:37.30]Right?
[23:40.82]Okay, good.
[23:43.08]Now I need, uh, I need some karaoke.
[23:50.56]Uh, free karaoke website.
[23:53.36]Oh, I gotta turn off the auto-tune, because it probably sounds stupid.
[24:00.97]Hey, what's up?
[24:02.85]It's me.
[24:06.99]So now let's go to... Well, what's a good free karaoke website?
[24:13.36]Turn off the dry signal, leave it 100% wet.
[24:15.78]Okay, red... Is this a real website?
[24:26.55]What's a good karaoke website?
[24:28.01]And don't you dare... Jibbait me!
[24:31.68]Don't you... Don't you dare... Jibbait me!
[24:38.94]You understand?
[24:47.11]Just YouTube it.
[24:47.93]Oh yeah, alright.
[24:48.57]Okay, how about tonight's gonna be a good night.
[24:51.04]Karaoke.
[24:53.50]I think that sounds pretty good.
[24:59.32]I got my auto-tune on.
[25:03.09]Tonight's gonna be a good night karaoke.
[25:08.65]They always sound so shitty too.
[25:10.23]It's always like somebody did it on a Casio keyboard.
[25:18.49]Okay, here we go.
[25:24.03]Make sure I can see it.
[25:24.75]You ready?
[25:37.11]I want to see some Curl of Poaching.
[25:42.93]Here we go.
[25:43.89]I got it.
[25:49.99]And to the literature board.
[25:56.85]I got a feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night.
[26:10.22]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[26:13.98]That tonight's gonna be a good, good night.
[26:17.41]Does that sound good?
[26:26.91]That's a night!
[26:30.09]Hello?
[26:30.41]Fucking come on.
[26:52.10]So this is not an autotune.
[26:55.55]Right.
[26:56.05]That makes sense.
[26:56.73]Okay.
[26:57.45]That's wrong.
[26:59.15]So, all right.
[27:00.73]I'm going to find the autotune.
[27:05.71]Hello.
[27:06.63]Hello.
[27:07.63]Hello.
[27:10.11]You can always tell when it's an autotune because... It sounds fine, right?
[27:22.30]I'm gonna rip through these octaves.
[27:24.40]Ready?
[27:30.36]This is auto-tune.
[27:31.34]It has to be.
[27:32.36]Okay.
[27:37.35]I'm ready.
[27:41.91]And in three, two, one.
[28:01.04]Come on, let's go.
[28:06.01]Clap it up.
[28:08.25]Clap it up.

[28:09.91]Let's clap it up.
[28:10.87]Let's clap it up.

[28:19.24]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:23.03]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:26.79]That tonight's gonna be a good, good night.
[28:30.43]I got a feeling.
[28:31.55]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:38.05]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:41.77]That tonight's gonna be a good, good night.
[28:45.57]I got a feeling.
[28:49.90]Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:53.04]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:56.80]That tonight's gonna be a good night.
[28:59.46]Doesn't this song have lyrics?
[29:01.50]I've got that feeling.
[29:03.46]How long does this go on for?
[29:07.15]How long does... That good night.
[29:11.79]That tonight's gonna be a good... Tonight's the night.

[31:38.26]I got a feeling That tonight's gonna be a good night That tonight's gonna be a good night Let me tell you something about politics
[31:59.63]We're going to move on to the politics discussion.
[32:13.11]Can I unmute that?
[32:14.59]Yeah, you can now.
[32:29.90]Do a different song.
[32:31.36]Why is this like auto-correcting?
[32:33.98]For some strange reason.
[32:38.78]That's better.
[32:40.58]I like that scary music.
[32:42.24]Oh god dammit, the fucking voice changer.
[32:44.06]Alright, so... You ready?
[32:59.52]Turn the light on.
[33:00.12]No, I'll get like a scary light in the closet.
[33:02.18]Don't worry.
[33:04.30]More red.
[33:05.38]Yeah, you're right.
[33:14.63]More red.
[33:15.13]I don't know how you're going to be able to hear me from back there.
[33:27.01]Hey, remember those, like, 3,000 people that came in the raid?
[33:30.47]Ooh.
[33:31.55]Alright, it's because the white balance is going automatically.
[33:37.96]Fuck off, white balance.
[33:44.46]That's better.
[33:50.10]That's pretty red.
[33:52.06]Oh, what happened?
[33:57.45]What happened?
[33:59.93]No, what?
[34:03.85]Hello?
[34:07.55]What the fuck happened here?
[34:16.56]Oh my god.
[34:24.83]I have to like re-cal- I- I- Give me a break.
[34:32.03]It's- the whole thing's crashed out.
[34:42.74]I guess this- did this webcam just die?
[34:44.58]I think the webcam just died.
[34:53.47]This thing's brand new!
[34:58.43]Hold on.
[35:00.13]I gotta, like, re- I gotta- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[35:05.34]What broke it?
[35:06.00]Because I changed the white balance?
[35:08.86]That's a lot of bullshit.
[35:12.76]Oh, yeah, it doesn't even know this thing's plugged in.
[35:14.10]I gotta, like, unplug it and plug- This is gonna, like, crash the whole stream.
[35:18.24]This is not good.
[35:21.46]What the hell?
[35:22.44]What?!
[35:24.40]I was just getting started with, like, the-
[35:31.63]Oh, this is not good.
[35:33.15]All right, I'm gonna try to rip it out because it's- No, what are you doing?
[35:37.58]Use the mic as a webcam.
[35:48.14]What does that even mean?
[35:50.44]Use my microphone as a webcam.
[35:57.22]What?
[35:58.66]I'm so confused.
[36:00.71]Hold on.
[36:02.42]Alright, everybody say it fucking Hail Mary because I'm ripping the cord out.
[36:06.00]Let's see if it happens.
[36:08.21]We good?
[36:08.57]Am I still alive?
[36:15.91]I'm good, right?
[36:16.47]I think we're good.
[36:25.32]We're good.
[36:36.20]Right.
[36:43.92]What happened to the camera?
[36:49.69]Am I still alive?
[36:51.89]And I mean that, that oracle hand physically.
[36:56.23]It looks like a thermal camera now.
[36:59.21]This thing's broken.
[37:04.27]Alright, what the fuck are we doing?
[37:05.41]Oh yeah, I was gonna get in that closet and say a bunch of bullshit.
[37:14.19]Can I, yeah, hello?
[37:15.13]Yeah, good.
[37:15.91]No, now something's really fucked up.
[37:21.22]Alright, so, I got, yeah, I got three monitors.
[37:24.54]One, two, three.
[37:25.48]Alright, so let's do a straw poll.
[37:29.50]Because I'm curious of what you guys think.
[37:35.53]Okay.
[37:50.61]Here you go.
[37:51.03]Please vote if you haven't.
[37:52.73]If you have, if you haven't, if there's not been even one, you don't understand, just, here you go.
[37:56.39]All right, so what do you guys want?
[37:58.72]What are you looking for today, huh?
[38:08.25]I wanted to see how badly this was going to lose.
[38:16.48]What is monster discussion?
[38:18.42]Well.
[38:24.80]I haven't figured that out yet.
[38:28.67]Can I vote for neither?
[38:29.59]Yeah.
[38:30.93]Just go like this.
[38:33.77]Already?
[38:34.35]Really?
[38:34.71]I didn't do anything yet!
[39:02.57]Okay.
[39:04.13]So, what are we looking at here?
[39:08.15]That's a fantastic cup.
[39:09.19]It was a gift.
[39:10.63]It was a gift from my girlfriend.
[39:12.41]I don't know, uh, I noticed she got it at some store.
[39:16.07]Probably get it on, uh, probably get it on Amazon.
[39:19.29]If I were to guess, maybe?
[39:22.57]Alright, so, it looks like, uh, I wanted to see how badly karaoke was going to get destroyed, and it didn't really get destroyed that badly, which is kind of a shock.
[39:32.49]That clip of me will go around and it'll be like... What an embarrassment.
[39:41.17]I know it will.
[39:41.63]And then I'm going to be lying there in bed, just with my fucking iPad, looking at clips of like, Good night!
[39:47.42]And I'm going to be like, oh fuck me, what have I done with myself?
[39:52.46]Alright, so let's go ahead and get some scary music.
[39:58.24]I'm going to turn the light down.
[40:05.66]I don't know why I was going that high.
[40:07.10]Okay.
[40:12.70]So, here we go.
[40:14.62]I gotta loop this.
[40:23.05]This is... My computer is fucked up.
[40:26.45]Did I, like, sing so poorly and with a fucking voice change around that it broke the computer?
[40:31.27]Let's see how this one sounds.
[40:41.41]That's pretty good.
[40:47.68]Now I'm gonna drop the light a lot.
[40:49.16]And then I'm gonna have a light in the closet.
[40:51.36]And I don't even know if you're gonna be able to hear me.
[41:02.10]The last time I fucked with the light on this thing, we had a huge problem.
[41:12.07]That's fine.
[41:15.22]A little more.
[41:22.58]That looks good.
[41:23.60]That looks good.
[41:25.24]That looks weird.
[41:29.99]Like my... Are my lips ever... Are my lips this big and red?
[41:36.48]Holy shit.
[41:37.10]This is not sweat on my shoulders.
[41:39.16]You can't do that one to me.
[41:40.78]Don't do me like this.
[41:42.21]That's not sweat.
[41:43.33]That's a light casting.
[41:45.63]I look like... No, it's my beard.
[41:50.87]I look pretty fucking evil.
[41:52.80]Alright, you ready?
[41:54.35]This is going to be awful.
[41:55.63]This whole, don't worry.
[41:57.09]Let me, let me like keep doing awful shit.
[41:59.75]So you forget how awful the karaoke portion of this stream was.
[42:03.42]And that wasn't even karaoke.
[42:04.26]It was just a joke, but forget it.
[42:06.26]Let's keep doing terrible shit.
[42:07.64]So like, well, look, when there's like 10 terrible bits in a row, what was the worst one?
[42:14.16]I don't remember what he, what was the first one he did?
[42:16.54]Oh, he did like the karaoke.
[42:17.61]Well, that was other, remember when he like fucking went outside his window and screamed?
[42:21.27]That was fucking stupid too.
[42:22.51]All right, let's go.
[42:33.56]How's this one?
[42:34.82]This one felt pretty evil.
[42:37.56]Let me tell you something else about the current climate.
[42:56.39]Monster's Reel, that's the tagline for this one.
[43:11.09]You might not even be able to fucking hear this.
[43:43.67]I'm coming for you.
[43:47.38]I'm coming for you.
[43:50.38]That's right.
[43:50.98]Monsters are real.
[43:57.82]You better hide under your belt.
[43:59.70]Because I'm coming to consume your soul.
[44:03.93]You sell only monsters.
[44:29.11]I'm too big, I'm too huge in your closet.
[44:59.60]This is a monster I have to deal with in a killing race.
[45:08.20]Fucking dicks.
[45:12.50]War makes me a monster in this climate.
[45:17.23]I need to get fed and clean.
[45:29.94]Then it was just a person the whole time!
[45:31.64]I think it was a person!
[45:45.74]It's even worse!
[45:46.96]And this is what I really look like!
[45:49.20]Don't you understand?
[46:13.94]Was I incomprehensible?
[46:18.42]We didn't hear anything.
[46:19.52]No, just give me a clip.
[46:21.60]Show it to me.
[46:24.07]I said some fucking good shit during that.
[46:31.93]Really?
[46:35.44]Oh, god damn it.
[46:36.54]Oh well.
[46:40.89]We got the gist of it.
[46:41.83]Alright, can I turn off, like, the... I gotta go back into here.
[46:48.48]All I heard was something about monsters being real.
[47:00.66]This is so fucked up.
[47:02.22]There we go.
[47:02.64]That looks better.
[47:04.37]Why does turning the brightness down fuck the whole thing up?
[47:13.19]Something about the closet being too small.
[47:14.95]Yeah.
[47:16.44]That was part of it.
[47:20.90]I heard the word Monsters Inc.
[47:22.40]Yeah, I got my photos developing back there.
[47:28.20]That's what's over there.
[47:37.02]I heard, don't call the police.
[47:53.07]Anyways, so right now, here's the funny story about that.
[47:59.70]Right there, right there.
[48:01.36]I mean, like, I mean, literally right there.
[48:03.75]is probably where Kim's head is, where she's lying down right now, on the other side of that closet wall.
[48:11.91]So she's probably just like, what the fuck is going on in that room?
[48:21.24]No, she's on the other side of the wall.
[48:24.69]She's not in there.
[48:26.65]You know what's in here?
[49:03.99]I will rip out your insides and wear them as a necklace!
[49:14.25]Ow!
[49:33.56]What a stupid monster.
[49:35.93]He throws foam pads out.
[49:41.75]Eat your ass as a necklace.
[49:43.75]No, that's not what I said.
[49:44.65]All right, so I've been sitting here for 51 minutes.
[50:07.31]I felt like it's been like three.
[50:11.59]Let me see, let me hear that.
[50:12.43]I don't know what it sounds like.
[50:13.37]That doesn't even sound scary.
[50:39.14]That sounds like shit.
[50:47.37]German's shitting himself right now.
[50:48.89]No, I'm fine.
[50:49.73]All right, so we had our fun in IRL.
[51:09.53]I will rip out your insides and wear them as a necklace.
[51:14.33]You can see my face.
[51:19.47]My like human, like boy face is just sitting right there like.
[51:23.83]All right, so here's what we're gonna do.
[51:27.44]I'm gonna change this from sitting around.
[51:35.14]Well, not yet, hold on, let me cancel that.
[51:39.41]Not quite yet.
[51:49.95]Uh, hold on.
[51:54.47]Alright, we're gonna do one more thing.
[51:55.57]What the hell is it?
[51:59.24]What is this one?
[52:01.74]Wow.
[52:03.62]That's terrifying.
[52:07.56]I should have used this one the whole fucking time.
[52:09.24]There's also this one, too?
[52:15.67]What is this?
[52:16.11]Testing.
[52:18.65]Testing.
[52:19.49]No, this one's not good.
[52:22.07]It's cool, but... Hello?
[52:24.99]Hello?
[52:25.65]What is... I don't know, what's the difference?
[52:27.09]This just... This just sounds like somebody, like, punched me right here.
[52:32.26]Sounds like I have something stuck in my throat.
[52:38.37]This is the Chad voice.
[52:40.21]Yeah, I mean, might as well just finish it up with a... I'm just kidding.
[52:47.13]I'm kidding.
[52:48.53]I'm not going to do it.
[52:50.73]Don't worry.
[53:09.30]Where's the root?
[53:11.56]Did it take me this long to find it?
[53:14.92]This is it.
[53:17.96]This is it.
[53:19.12]I found it.
[53:21.10]There's like 150 ones to click on here.
[53:25.38]What about this one?
[53:27.34]Hey, hey.
[53:29.86]Magic.
[53:30.82]This is it.
[53:43.51]This actually is the one.
[53:48.81]Okay.
[53:49.57]So, I mean... What's a song that I want to sing before we move on?
[54:07.17]A Rats mixtape.
[54:11.15]September, yeah, it's a good one.
[54:24.29]How's this sound?
[54:25.01]Pretty good?
[54:30.90]It's not fixing my key.
[54:32.80]It's not fixing it.
[54:36.34]But don't matter, I can knock this out of the park, you can redo it.
[54:38.96]Do you remember?
[54:40.18]The 21st night of September.
[54:45.11]Love was changing the minds of pretenders.
[54:49.01]And the s- Uh, it fucked up.
[54:52.15]It wasn't even on the screen.
[54:54.56]Our hearts were ringing in the key that our souls were singing.
[55:00.39]As we danced in the night, I remember how the stars stole the night away.
[55:12.54]Say that you remember dancing in September.
[55:20.30]Never was a cloudy day.
[55:35.55]Ba-doo-doo, ba-doo-doo, ba-doo, ba-doo-doo, ba-doo-doo, ba-doo-doo, ba-doo-ba-ba-doo.
[55:47.10]Ba-doo-doo, ba- Oh, that's, I fucking hate this.
[55:50.52]I almost just clicked stop streaming.
[55:56.29]I was like hovering over and I almost just clicked it.
[55:58.69]Alright, so we're gonna move on.
[56:05.01]Thanks for hanging out for the IRL.
[56:06.49]I don't even know what I did.
[56:10.48]I was bored and wanted to do this for like an hour.
[56:17.28]What are you linking?
[56:21.88]It's not fixing my key.
[56:24.03]It's not fixing it.
[56:24.77]It probably sounds all right.
[56:27.61]It don't matter.
[56:28.13]I can knock this out of the park.
[56:29.33]You can redo it.
[56:30.19]Do you remember?
[56:32.88]Why is it off?
[56:33.52]I was doing this perfect.
[56:35.00]Why is it off beat?
[56:36.74]Oh shit.
[56:54.61]Okay, it's offbeat because this takes like about 150 milliseconds to change the voice.
[57:00.66]There's a delay on the actual voice changer.
[57:10.06]Oh well.
[57:14.18]I thought you just had no rhythm.
[57:15.80]No, that's not what it is.
[57:19.64]Don't avoid change.
[57:20.58]Yeah, I actually can fix that in here, but I didn't think about that.
[57:26.06]Too busy doing other dumb shit.
[57:29.24]Prove it with video evidence.
[57:31.86]I mean, hold on.
[57:35.46]Is this coming out correct?
[57:39.82]Is that synced up?
[57:40.76]Because it's turned off right now.
[57:44.58]It should be like, ready?
[57:48.81]so but now that it's on delay it's the same so it's because it doesn't matter hold on a second I got an idea make it go 150 milliseconds no I can do this ready I'm just going to delay
[58:21.34]Can you tell me, did I fix it?
[58:28.15]Love was changing the minds of pretenders.
[58:31.99]No, what?
[58:32.45]It's worse now.
[58:33.23]How is it worse?
[58:51.56]Maybe I have to do this.
[58:52.30]I don't know if this fixes it.
[58:54.93]Ready?
[58:55.13]Whatever.
[59:29.72]Was that too loud?
[59:30.46]I have the limiter on.
[59:31.22]The limiter doesn't work?
[59:32.10]No, the limiter doesn't work.
[59:41.06]All right, thanks for watching this stream.

[60:46.56]I'm really... I'm really actually fucking sorry for doing that fucked up... Made a loud noise or something.
[60:52.75]Sorry.
[60:54.01]That's not my intention at all.
[60:55.63]I promise.
[61:00.95]Now it's delayed.
[61:01.75]Well, it's because I have to do this now.
[61:05.70]Alright, let's play Kenshi.
[61:10.80]I forgive you this time.
[61:12.48]Thank you.
[61:16.08]It's not still delayed.
[61:17.06]I can see it in real time right here.
[61:23.92]Uh, what was it called?
[61:24.52]The Band of... The Band of Merry, uh... Frog... Frog Crew?
[61:38.60]Play GeoGuessr.
[61:39.64]Wait, why am I getting a huge... Play GeoGuessr.
[61:42.18]GeoGuessr.
[61:42.76]GeoGuessr.
[61:45.04]You want more of this shit?
[61:49.64]What is going on in this chat right now?
[61:56.61]Oh my god.
[62:09.34]Alright, hold on.
[62:11.04]I'm gonna play Kenshi for a little while, because I planned on it anyways.
[62:20.05]So then after Kenshi, maybe three or four hours of Kenshi, I'll pull out and we'll play some... Why would I... I don't wanna... Alright, we'll see.
[62:31.86]And now I'm getting booed.
[62:33.80]Now I'm getting booed.
[62:35.18]It's okay.
[62:37.30]We'll just keep the fucking camera on, who cares.
[62:38.94]This'll be the one webcam stream every three months that you get on this stream.
[62:45.23]That's fine.
[62:49.53]And then I need to move over here.
[62:53.42]Is this the frog crew, right?
[63:02.08]You actually want to know what Kenshi is.
[63:03.58]It's a great simulation, frog simulating kind of game where you start as a frog, and you start as a tadpole, and then from tadpole you go to adolescent, and then from adolescent you go to frog, and then from frog you go to adult frog.
[63:19.37]And you eat fish and you eat flies and stuff.
[63:23.87]It's really cool.
[63:28.58]You get a dog.
[63:30.02]Now this needs to move this way.
[63:36.20]And let's open it up.
[63:41.35]Kenshi, back to Kenshi.
[63:46.01]I'm probably gonna mute this for a second just because it's probably gonna be pretty loud.
[63:49.37]So let's go with that.
[63:56.16]You should see it right now.
