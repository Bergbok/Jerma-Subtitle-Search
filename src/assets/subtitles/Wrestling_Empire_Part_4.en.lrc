[00:00.58]What's happening?
[00:03.81]What's up?
[00:10.17]Somebody said, what's cocaine like?
[00:13.43]Will you relax?
[00:19.90]The first thing that you're going to say in this chat, first thing you're going to ask me in 2023, that's your first comment of the whole year.
[00:29.72]Oh, my God.
[00:32.42]No, what's up?
[00:32.88]How's everybody doing?
[00:35.57]Welcome to the first stream of... First?
[00:37.31]There's a lot of first-time chatters.
[00:38.95]What's going on here?
[00:44.83]It's like only first-time chatters.
[00:47.86]What?
[00:48.12]Have I just not paid attention to any of this?
[00:53.88]Does this happen all the time?
[00:54.98]Do I just not... There's a lot of these.
[00:58.81]It's because it's EU friendly.
[01:02.26]Oh.
[01:04.80]It's an EU friendly stream.
[01:08.00]It is noon Pacific, you're right.
[01:11.20]Well, Happy New Year.
[01:12.27]I mean, it's not that early.
[01:16.49]A lot of my streams start only a couple hours from now.
[01:23.67]I wouldn't say this is super EU friendly.
[01:26.98]But whatever, I'm doing the thing where I'm very clearly leaning back and my chin is going down.
[01:32.34]Because I have to burp, but I'm still talking.
[01:35.22]You're still fucking hearing my sentence, by the way.
[01:37.56]I'm not going to stop and burp.
[01:38.96]No, no, no, I'm not done talking yet.
[01:43.95]I'm good now.
[01:47.73]How long is this stream going to be?
[01:48.87]I don't know.
[01:51.51]I'll tell you what we're doing, though.
[01:58.78]It's a little game called Wrestling Empire.
[02:01.26]I do admit I have been getting the itch to come back to this game.
[02:09.85]The last time we played it was, what, six months ago?
[02:13.33]Five months ago?
[02:17.47]Saw a lot of what Moon Moon was doing.
[02:20.25]And it just made the itch just unscratchable, so I had to play it.
[02:25.59]So Wrestling Empire is the first stream of the new year.
[02:36.89]He's itchy.
[02:41.71]And I will tell you... How many goblins approximately do you think you could take in a single time?
[02:48.45]Um... A lot.
[02:51.53]I actually think a lot.
[02:53.35]How big are they?
[02:56.09]I'm thinking 10.
[02:57.51]Do I have a weapon?
[02:59.70]10.
[03:00.70]Is it just fist?
[03:02.82]Is it just fist versus fist?
[03:10.27]I don't know.
[03:10.77]I forget who even said that.
[03:13.04]Do I get a weapon?
[03:14.26]Or is it just like I can punch?
[03:20.64]It's my grandma's birthday.
[03:22.12]Play Elden Ring.
[03:23.08]No, I'm not playing Elden Ring until later.
[03:27.33]Stop stalling.
[03:28.65]It's been four minutes.
[03:30.47]Just relax for a second.
[03:31.93]Okay.
[03:34.35]Four minutes is not a stall.
[03:36.73]That is one to two minutes for the intro, and I've been talking for less than two minutes.
[03:43.15]A stall would be fifteen minutes.
[03:44.37]A stall is fifteen minutes, not four.
[03:49.13]I've only been speaking for two minutes.
[03:52.03]This is a normal length for an introduction to a broadcast.
[03:56.37]Very normal.
[03:59.15]But I think I could beat up ten goblins.
[04:02.11]Without a doubt.
[04:05.41]Honestly, it might even be 20.
[04:10.64]If there's no weapons involved, I think I'm alright.
[04:18.28]So, uh, something... So, Holly and I, last night, were... making characters in this game.
[04:28.97]I was like, you know what?
[04:29.59]Maybe I will play it.
[04:30.41]Yeah, that sounds like fun.
[04:32.79]I made a bunch of people.
[04:34.23]Holly and I, we kind of just took turns making characters.
[04:38.84]And there's like 12, 13, 14 characters we put in the same league.
[04:43.54]I don't even know who to play with.
[04:45.24]I have no idea.
[04:46.06]In fact, I don't think I'm going to make a character right now.
[04:52.26]We'll have to see.
[04:57.82]Goblin has a battleaxe.
[04:59.44]That's easy.
[05:04.52]Stop stalling.
[05:05.73]This is not a stick.
[05:06.77]Get out of here with this.
[05:11.41]Goblins have claws.
[05:14.95]And I've got... I don't know.
[05:19.82]Choke them.
[05:21.60]Oh no.
[05:22.10]Claws?
[05:22.52]What do we think I have?
[05:27.08]doesn't make any sense oops I have hey I I've what you don't think I have claws too you don't think alright we're moving on from this welcome back uh happy new year again everybody hope your 2023 goes well no I would just I I'm I could do it I don't have to prove this I'm already proving something later this year
[05:52.90]Alright, Wrestling Empire, you guys ready?
[05:55.44]Everyone's just ready.
[05:57.57]We don't have to sit around.
[06:00.23]It's ready to go.
[06:03.97]So the question here, alright, let's go over some of the characters.
[06:08.75]So, here's who I've made.
[06:12.70]Again, Holly and I sat down.
[06:13.90]This is Sebastian Sleaze.
[06:15.32]I just picked Wrestling Revolution, because that was, I think, the most characters of here.
[06:22.93]So we got Sebastian Sleaze runs the operation.
[06:26.13]I made Scorned.
[06:27.17]I don't know if that was like funny, I guess.
[06:29.78]Here's the Android.
[06:34.46]Which I thought I think the Android looks kind of cool.
[06:36.60]Here's Walti.
[06:40.94]Walti.
[06:44.32]I didn't make Scally.
[06:46.11]I think I just added the Y because I just saw that before making the character.
[06:50.05]Here's Phil.
[06:52.25]Phil.
[06:55.20]It's Wicked Wilma.
[07:02.36]Lionel of the Mountain.
[07:07.23]Q-Gene.
[07:10.51]Handsome.
[07:13.29]What else is here?
[07:14.15]Oh, Scratch.
[07:19.12]The Gnat.
[07:19.82]I think it's already on the Gnat, by the way.
[07:24.79]Amphibia Adam.
[07:28.46]Who else?
[07:30.26]Gil?
[07:31.88]And I think that's it.
[07:34.78]Who do I play with?
[07:36.89]I don't know who to play with.
[07:37.73]I don't know what to do right now.
[07:42.55]This would be, what, the third or fourth run through of this game?
[07:47.11]Make another character.
[07:48.12]You want me to make another character?
[07:57.68]I think I want to play with... No, should I play with the gnat and just... Who cares?
[08:03.06]Make another... Alright.
[08:04.10]Alright, fine.
[08:05.80]Who do I make?
[08:10.99]I feel like I put all of my happinesses in some of these, right?
[08:16.91]But first of all, hold on.
[08:17.87]You can't even see me!
[08:18.83]Alright, you want to make a new character?
[08:22.91]Alright, who should I make?
[08:26.66]Make sure in the editor.
[08:27.55]Hi, by the way.
[08:28.51]Good to see you.
[08:29.47]Alright.
[08:30.77]How about this?
[08:32.63]Only four weeks left here, though.
[08:36.39]Alright.

[08:47.32]No, I made I already made me before and I don't want to make me.
[08:52.03]Alright.
[08:52.29]How about Scali?
[08:53.39]No, we'll keep in Scali.
[08:54.51]Alright.
[08:55.49]Woodrow.
[08:59.67]Except I need to change this.
[09:02.59]I don't want you to have a partner.
[09:06.71]So who do I make?
[09:07.75]You guys didn't like any of those 12 characters?
[09:11.90]Now he's stalling.
[09:15.10]That person gets it.
[09:18.62]Make Miku.
[09:22.58]You want me to make Miku?
[09:24.73]No, these are all original characters.
[09:27.71]These are all original characters.
[09:30.83]No, not yet.
[09:31.95]We'll do that later.
[09:35.42]No, you know what?
[09:35.94]I'm getting started on the gnat.
[09:37.14]I don't even care.
[09:38.40]I'm just playing as the gnat.
[09:39.40]I'm playing as the gnat.
[09:40.76]We're starting with the gnat.
[09:42.86]I made all these characters.
[09:45.14]I made all these.
[09:45.82]I'm going to relax because I don't want to get angry.
[09:48.52]It's the new year.
[09:51.13]Holly and I made all these characters last night.
[09:54.11]Let's go.
[09:54.53]I'm going with gnat.
[09:56.95]What do you mean too late?
[09:57.88]Alright, it's already on the gnat.
[10:00.08]I promise that wasn't picked previously.
[10:02.42]I didn't mean to pick that.
[10:05.06]I didn't want to pick the gnat, but the gnat was there already.
[10:07.42]People are going to think I did it on purpose.
[10:10.86]Alright, so let's go.
[10:12.02]For those of you that have no idea what this game is, you're balding.
[10:15.45]Yeah, I'm almost 40.
[10:16.61]Good.
[10:17.37]I can't wait.
[10:18.61]What was I saying?
[10:21.65]Of course you know how this game works.
[10:22.81]You've seen it like five times now.
[10:24.11]Let's go.
[10:27.05]You never should have taken this step, The Gnat.
[10:29.33]You don't have what it takes to survive in the real world.
[10:32.73]I didn't make this person.
[10:34.39]If you want to be escorted to the ring safely, just admit you made a mistake and back out.
[10:37.83]This is literally the first time I've ever been here.
[10:47.15]I see you decided to take responsibility for what happens behind the scenes, The Gnat.
[10:51.81]What's wrong with this guy?
[10:54.41]If you take this road, it's your responsibility to get through the curtain in time.
[10:57.35]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:57.93]It turns green.
[10:58.65]You have to get through the curtain.
[10:59.71]Yep.
[11:01.07]This guy, why is this guy so fucked up?
[11:07.56]This character, yeah, is like four, five, or four, six.
[11:13.22]Okay, yeah, we know how this works.
[11:15.48]The first match is a singles match.
[11:16.66]Wait, does this character suck?
[11:18.82]This character might actually be awful.
[11:30.70]Alright, will you stop explaining?
[11:32.26]Dude, go sit down.
[11:33.20]Oh, I missed.
[11:42.56]Should I just hurt him?
[11:46.82]Alright, fuck this guy.
[11:47.60]I'm out of here.
[11:48.64]Wait, it's not time for my match.
[11:49.62]When's my match?
[11:52.63]Look at how hurt this guy is.
[12:06.35]He was like helping me.
[12:11.33]Shit, I forgot you could do that.
[12:14.17]What do they want?
[12:14.73]What do you want?
[12:18.01]Power slam?
[12:18.84]Is it... What is it?
[12:19.70]A magazine?
[12:26.58]Give me the... Can I take it?
[12:29.58]Give me that back or I'll show you what it's for.
[12:33.56]What?
[12:44.68]Alright, am I already fucking everything up?
[12:50.56]What is this?
[12:50.94]Is this a menu at a restaurant, or is this a magazine?
[13:00.42]Oh shit, okay, here we go.
[13:03.40]Light reading.
[13:04.62]That's not my time yet.
[13:06.36]Don't let anybody scare you out of taking this route.
[13:08.14]They're at risk, but it can also be more fulfilling.
[13:10.28]Oh my god, that's Lionel of the Mountain!
[13:14.05]Friend?
[13:17.43]Got her back.
[13:22.89]Oh, wait.
[13:23.43]This lady's magazine.
[13:25.37]Alright, here.
[13:27.75]You can have it back.
[13:30.91]Right in the nose.
[13:33.01]What is this?
[13:34.78]Oh, that's right.
[13:35.34]They added new items.
[13:36.76]You can dig?
[13:37.42]That's right.
[13:41.58]I remember reading the patch notes.
[13:43.58]I gotta get back inside.
[13:49.22]Find a treasure.
[13:49.90]There's a treasure?
[13:50.48]There's also presents, too, which you can open, I think.
[13:54.50]Yep.
[13:58.24]Oh my god, there's just $300 on the ground.
[14:01.18]Stop!
[14:03.02]This shovel is mine now, Nat.
[14:04.98]Just assume everything you own is mine.
[14:08.70]Why is this guy such a dick?
[14:13.69]God damn it, right before a fucking match, too.
[14:15.63]Help!
[14:15.99]Somebody help me!
[14:22.26]Why am I getting Rube Goldberg wrestled?
[14:26.87]Oh my God, this is bad.
[14:33.55]Alright, let's go.
[14:42.41]FNAF!
[14:45.81]This microphone, oh my God.
[14:47.85]Just look at how big this microphone is.
[14:53.02]This microphone is huge.
[14:54.24]It's not supposed to be like this.
[14:55.02]Look it.
[14:55.42]Even in his hand.
[14:57.86]Someone's going to take this from me.
[14:59.46]And you'll see how big it is.
[15:00.34]Oh, wait.
[15:00.56]There's a SCORN.
[15:05.17]I'm realizing right now that SCORN is just pain.
[15:09.21]He's just different colors here.
[15:12.07]Look at how big the microphone is.
[15:13.71]Even if it was in somebody's hand.
[15:14.81]That's bigger.
[15:15.29]That's bigger.
[15:18.93]Ackwright, I know you're cowering backstage, clinging to that inter-title of yours.
[15:26.11]That may be the safest place for you right now, but that treasure can't stay buried forever.
[15:29.96]If I had the shovel... What's happening?
[15:53.37]Are we alright?
[15:53.91]Did I win?
[15:58.88]Alright, this motherfucker has an urn in his hands.
[16:12.55]I'm running.
[16:20.23]What the fuck was that?
[16:27.25]I don't even have a microphone anymore.
[16:37.28]Alright, let's keep going.
[16:41.98]Oh, wait, give me that apple.
[16:43.28]Actually, give me that apple.
[16:44.01]I want it.
[16:50.01]My health is so low.
[16:50.81]Wait, is my health low or did it not save all the shit that happened?
[16:56.71]Right when I got beat up backstage.
[17:00.33]It did.
[17:00.77]Come on.
[17:03.49]So this is just a regular match.
[17:04.51]First match of the evening.
[17:05.31]Let's go.
[17:06.19]I'm already going to lose.
[17:07.35]I think I made this guy's stats awful.
[17:18.55]I hope I didn't.
[17:24.55]Alright, we're good.
[17:26.38]The gnat sucks.
[17:27.34]Well, no, the gnat sucks because I got beat up backstage.
[17:37.14]Alright, the character sucks.
[17:39.01]The character... That's actually a pretty effective way to deal with that.
[17:55.25]Here we go.
[17:55.63]Alright, let's get it back together here.
[18:05.91]Get up.
[18:09.02]Okay.
[18:13.82]There is a shovel out there.
[18:18.96]Oh my god, what the fuck are you doing?
[18:32.11]Try to just leave the arena.
[18:39.46]I'm covered in blood already.
[18:42.78]Oh my god.
[18:43.32]Alright.
[18:52.63]Already a disaster.
[18:57.49]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[19:00.37]Alright, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[19:06.50]Is this illegal?
[19:14.36]Why did the ref get hurt?
[19:25.86]I'm so screwed.
[19:31.21]Illegal.
[19:31.63]Call him out for that.
[19:32.45]Get him in trouble for that.
[19:33.19]He should be...
[19:35.10]Are you gonna restart?
[19:37.66]No!
[19:44.93]I am gonna be a coward, though.
[19:46.19]You better believe it.
[19:49.77]Shit.
[19:54.13]I'm too... I am too short.
[19:57.00]I'm hitting the ledge when I throw the things into the ring.
[20:01.82]Are you kidding me?
[20:10.45]Alright, I gotta do a stand-up with this guy.
[20:16.85]Oh, God.
[20:17.67]Alright.
[20:20.69]I'll be alright.
[20:23.24]Look, I'm not... You don't win every single match.
[20:24.90]It's okay.
[20:28.68]What a moron.
[20:31.20]Advantage.
[20:31.60]Take the advantage of it.
[20:39.80]What is with this reversal bullshit?
[20:49.98]Stop!
[20:58.94]He's gonna get counted out.
[21:00.98]He's at six right now.
[21:02.76]I just gotta be an annoying little gnat.
[21:06.03]Just keep him out here and win.
[21:12.66]He's doing a move to me?
[21:14.00]Oh, shit.
[21:16.33]No!
[21:18.19]No!
[21:26.09]Get up.
[21:37.78]How is he still standing?
[21:38.86]Here we go.
[21:40.31]Give me that.
[21:43.17]Yes!
[21:50.79]Same deal.
[21:51.91]Just keep him out here.
[21:58.50]Oh, come on!
[21:59.10]How did he not fall down from that?
[22:07.96]The only way I can win is if I get him outside.
[22:10.52]Change the camera settings?
[22:14.48]What is it on right now?
[22:15.70]What should I do to?
[22:16.48]I feel like I did change this for some reason when I was making people.
[22:20.88]What should it be?
[22:23.92]Camera's fine.
[22:25.04]Is it good?
[22:26.36]Hard camera.
[22:27.42]Players only, right?
[22:33.83]Do first person.
[22:34.83]There is a first person.
[22:35.69]We'll do it later.
[22:36.27]I think it's fine.
[22:37.51]Yeah.
[22:42.11]What are you?
[22:42.81]I'm an idiot.
[22:45.56]Although I have not lost yet, so we're okay so far.
[22:48.74]Alright, let me do some actual technical wrestling here.
[22:50.88]Good start.
[23:01.83]Oh my... He just was palming my face.
[23:21.60]Can I just go for like a little pin right now?
[23:24.06]That would be so awesome.
[23:25.34]Technical wrestling.
[23:29.60]I mean, it'd be great if he didn't reverse every single move I did.
[23:34.07]You suck.
[23:34.91]Dun dun.
[23:35.51]You suck.
[23:38.73]No, I was just being a little asshole backstage and it's what got me into trouble.
[23:42.83]It's alright.
[23:43.17]We're going outside.
[23:43.67]There's only three minutes left.
[23:53.95]Can you dig?
[23:57.31]Can I make a hazard?
[24:14.66]Stop swinging so much!
[24:22.56]I'm gonna win.
[24:23.18]I'm gonna win right now.
[24:26.00]Oh, it's over.
[24:26.48]I win.
[24:27.18]Just don't fuck this up.
[24:36.59]I'm gonna win.
[24:41.03]That's game over right there.
[24:42.15]First match won.
[24:58.49]That's like a VIP.
[25:02.45]That guy paid 10 grand for that seat.
[25:09.12]What was it?
[25:09.58]Who was that guy?
[25:19.52]I can't make a giant hole, right?
[25:21.97]What happens if I just keep doing this?
[25:44.54]VIP's pissed.
[25:48.40]Okay, let go of my arm, please.
[25:49.96]Imagine walking by that.
[26:00.94]Somebody from the crowd comes out and just puts me in an armbar.
[26:11.45]Alright.
[26:13.49]Scorned is really good.
[26:14.59]Look at these stats.
[26:15.61]I try to keep everybody between like 70 and 80, like 72 to 75-ish.
[26:18.69]Alright, well.
[26:23.25]The Nats' progress is being hindered by the limitations of Wrestling Revolution.
[26:27.87]What?
[26:28.55]Why?
[26:32.03]But what?
[26:35.63]The limitations?
[26:40.80]He has worse stats than everybody in the whole league.
[26:47.54]This is the worst promotion.
[26:48.74]Oh.
[26:56.27]So I made everybody in the worst league?
[27:02.49]I wrapped that cash for somebody else.
[27:04.69]Nat, who said you could open it?
[27:06.27]What are you talking about?
[27:09.35]Remember the money that weighed the present in the very beginning?
[27:17.61]I opened up a present on the ground and there was money in it.
[27:23.38]But dude, why are you putting money into a present and just leaving it on the ground?
[27:27.27]There's so many people around.
[27:28.19]Okay.
[27:31.69]Alright, so this is the really popular one.
[27:35.99]But everybody in here has like 90, 90, you know, 85, 85, 85.
[27:41.64]Vending machines and water bottles.
[27:43.76]Three-man sumo contest.
[27:45.16]What is a... What is a... Why would I be in a sumo contest?
[27:52.53]Who are the... Who are my opponents?
[27:54.21]Can I see that?
[27:57.62]Okay, 20 o'clock.
[27:58.28]Got two hours.
[28:12.40]The gnat is in a sumo.
[28:13.88]Yeah, that's weird.
[28:14.62]Am I going to get in trouble for this?
[28:21.83]Oh, wait, was that for me?
[28:25.59]What do you think?
[28:27.75]He was happy about that.
[28:35.51]Something you want to say to me.
[28:41.03]Um, yeah, I have a proposal for you.
[28:42.61]What do you have my attention?
[28:45.29]What do you want to talk about?
[28:46.11]Let's work together.
[28:55.95]How do you see us working together?
[28:57.17]Um, can you be my manager?
[29:06.86]Oh, that's right.
[29:07.70]Okay, right, right, right.
[29:08.72]If they're in a different... Right, okay.
[29:11.56]If they're in a different company, then you can't do any of this.
[29:14.04]Alright, well, I'm just looking for food on the ground.
[29:17.57]I got an hour.
[29:19.39]Yeah, you have to be in the same promotion.
[29:22.83]From what I remember.
[29:24.07]Oh, there's Lionel of the Mountain.
[29:26.61]He's my friend.
[29:29.48]See, you got a microphone in your gift.
[29:30.94]I received a sign in mine once.
[29:38.89]Alright.
[29:39.41]Cool.
[29:41.62]Very cool.
[29:43.10]Nice.
[29:43.44]You got a sign.
[29:48.94]Alright.
[29:49.16]I got to get in there.
[29:49.80]Any more food on the ground?
[30:01.17]I'm not going in there with half health.
[30:06.21]Grab the gun.
[30:06.77]You can't use the gun though.
[30:12.11]I'll take it.
[30:12.91]No, it costs money if you take it, right?
[30:14.25]Alright, I think I'm alright.
[30:18.61]I've got, like, 70%?
[30:28.42]No, it costs money.
[30:29.10]Hot dog.
[30:32.60]If you walk out with a prop, it costs, like, $150 every time.
[30:39.06]Who's in this match?
[30:41.00]Oh, it's a sumo match.
[30:42.04]Right, okay, I get it already.
[30:50.11]Is it us?
[30:50.77]Ooh, who's in this match?
[30:51.93]Three-man sumo contest.
[31:08.79]Why is there a table on top of their table?
[31:13.85]That's very confusing.
[31:14.85]Is this for the championship already?
[31:18.79]This is not for the championship already, is it?
[31:21.99]What's the... What do you do here?
[31:39.35]I just hit my fucking head on the stairs.
[31:42.65]At the back of my skull, like the worst part.
[31:44.91]Like the soft part of your head.
[31:46.05]I just hit it.
[31:52.93]Okay, it's red eye.
[31:54.45]Should I just put tables in here?
[31:59.68]Back right, I'm sure you think winning a fight involves being on top for three precious seconds.
[32:04.48]Did I set this up?
[32:05.58]Somebody just got hurt.
[32:10.06]When you win a real fight, the loser doesn't get up ever agai- OW!
[32:19.10]You hit me right in the face!
[32:21.82]You dick!
[32:25.23]Somebody already wins over the table!
[32:28.17]What's wrong with this guy?
[32:29.45]Dude, I'm just gonna drink all the fucking drinks out here and have full health.
[32:36.05]Are you serious?
[32:37.23]The match doesn't start until I go in.
[32:43.56]There's so many drinks out here.
[32:46.46]I'm going to get to full health.
[32:56.37]What is it?
[32:56.63]Is it something on fire?
[32:59.85]What's burning?
[33:06.75]What happened to you?
[33:09.37]What are the rules?
[33:25.41]finishing move.
[33:26.77]Why am I losing health?
[33:33.36]Is it a pin?
[33:37.24]If you fall out of the ring, you lose.
[33:39.25]Oh, shit.
[33:39.79]That's not good.
[33:40.29]All these tables are meaningless then.
[33:55.30]Alright, I gotta... So don't get thrown over the top ropes?
[34:09.35]So there's no submissions, there's no nothing.
[34:17.69]You could help.
[34:18.51]You could do anything right now.
[34:21.54]Alright, so I'm just going to do this.
[34:23.21]I got a great idea.
[34:23.99]Are you fucking kidding me?
[34:24.79]Why would I do anything else?
[34:25.51]Check this out.
[34:28.01]Now I'm safe.
[35:00.03]Just don't get thrown over the top rope.
[35:06.37]They're both so concerned with wearing the belt.
[35:15.16]Yeah, what are you going to do about it?
[35:16.42]Nothing.
[35:18.82]Throw him over.
[35:19.56]Get him over the top.
[35:20.74]He's out.
[35:21.06]It's over.
[35:21.38]I win.
[35:46.86]Don't do it!
[36:01.97]Stop!
[36:02.45]Oh my god.
[36:05.56]Get up.
[36:05.88]I'm trying.
[36:17.64]How did I miss?
[36:18.72]I threw it.
[36:19.48]How did I miss that poorly?
[36:21.18]That was so bad.
[36:29.72]Get outside.
[36:30.64]Get outside.
[36:44.65]What are you...
[36:47.67]Okay, I think I won.
[36:53.37]I was going for a spectacle.
[37:12.01]I was going for a spectacle.
[37:18.32]Wait, they are friends?
[37:22.35]Weren't we just fighting?
[37:32.69]I did pretty well in that.
[37:34.35]Somebody interfered, but whatever.
[37:40.98]I won!
[37:41.62]I actually, that was for the championship!
[37:45.44]That's the second match I've ever had!
[37:54.29]Alright, going pretty well so far.
[37:57.97]I'm the new champion.
[38:03.27]That's actually amazing.
[38:04.41]I can't believe it.
[38:10.75]I heard you smashed a table, The Gnat.
[38:14.27]You'll never be welcome back in this venue.
[38:17.33]They were everywhere.
[38:21.67]Why is that my problem?
[38:27.23]Yep.
[38:27.55]I'm gonna stay that way.
[38:34.58]See this thing right here?
[38:35.32]Yeah, you dream of this belt every day.
[38:45.71]Do I have a match today?
[38:54.12]Okay.
[38:55.14]It's only a matter of time before the inter-title is mine.
[38:57.36]You might as well just drop it now.
[39:01.71]Throw that back.
[39:10.65]You may have beaten me in the ring.
[39:12.05]What is this guy talking about?
[39:13.68]What the fuck are you doing?
[39:14.86]Leave me alone!
[39:15.68]We had a match like two weeks ago, and it was a regular match.
[39:19.88]You just... I... Well, actually...
[39:24.57]Yeah, actually, I kind of... Didn't I beat him with a stick for a while?
[39:37.20]Am I okay?
[39:41.93]Oh, it's the end of the sh... Alright, I'm going.
[39:43.51]I'm getting out of here.
[39:53.12]Alright, I gotta go to the hotel.
[39:54.66]I gotta wear my belt.
[39:56.70]How do I wear it?
[39:59.42]There we go.
[40:06.02]Do not hit me with a sledgehammer, please.
[40:11.34]Alright, bedtime.
[40:11.98]Is this food?
[40:21.08]What is this?
[40:22.71]Oh, they're brass knuckles.
[40:23.63]They just look huge on me.
[40:24.29]Alright, go to bed.
[40:36.14]I think I puked on the floor.
[40:39.08]Go to the bar?
[40:43.18]After eight hours of comfortable sleep, the gnat's energy levels are now at 75%.
[40:48.87]scorned has developed a friendship with hugh jazz of federation online okay okay alright so this is versus this is for a non-title singles match versus Eugene and I got nothing tomorrow
[41:16.37]Alright, 21.
[41:17.05]I need to, I gotta heal.
[41:18.00]I need to, uh, eat food or something.
[41:20.54]Why would I be fighting, aren't we in two completely different weight classes?
[41:33.12]What's up, guys?
[41:33.58]Alright, just need to eat.
[41:44.86]Just get close to full health.
[41:49.80]Oh, no, there's a spear.
[41:50.60]I don't want that.
[41:55.02]Imagine eating four double cheeseburgers before a big athletic event.
[41:59.76]Alright, that's good.
[42:06.45]That's good.
[42:06.77]I don't need any more.
[42:08.15]Costs like 10 bucks every time.
[42:17.19]Eat the table.
[42:20.91]Skate five.
[42:22.59]Wait, you can, can't you?
[42:23.49]How do I do it?
[42:24.89]How do you skate?
[42:29.01]Enjoy it while it lasts, but nobody actually believes you're the interchampion.
[42:34.66]I mean, I get it.
[42:35.68]It's been two weeks.
[42:38.04]How do I use it?
[42:45.59]Not right before a match.
[42:51.71]Get off!
[42:54.73]Oh my- I think he accidentally just did that.
[42:57.67]Not right before a match!
[42:59.11]What the- How do I- I know you can ride this.
[43:08.30]Why can't I ride it?
[43:10.54]Wha- This skateboard is mine.
[43:13.84]Stop!
[43:20.44]I'm more skillful than you.
[43:22.81]God damn it.
[43:23.53]I'm actually fucking annoyed right now because I don't want to be fighting these people.
[43:31.83]Give me the skateboard.
[43:35.35]I have a match.
[43:41.22]Why are they all such dicks?
[43:49.94]Somebody said, am I an idiot?
[43:51.50]I didn't do anything.
[43:52.72]This guy just jumped me.
[43:54.06]I can't see where I'm going.
[44:12.10]I have to get in the ring right now.
[44:28.98]Please, I gotta get there in time.
[44:30.22]I have to get there, I have to get there in time.
[44:31.57]Hopefully the skateboard Uber can get me there quickly.
[44:39.91]This is not the title, right?
[44:40.97]Is there any food?
[44:45.85]Look at how tired I am.
[44:59.23]This microphone's costing you money every time, isn't it?
[45:04.45]I'm fighting the biggest guy in the entire league.
[45:08.72]This is not fair.
[45:13.20]Loads like to keep count.
[45:14.08]This is the first title I've won in my career.
[45:18.68]It's also the last title you'll ever hold.
[45:20.60]If you want to make history, I'll make you history.
[45:23.56]This is not... This is actually not fair.
[45:25.95]Maybe I should start counting title defenses so that you get to be another notch on my belt.
[45:40.49]Just run.
[45:41.55]Just run.
[45:44.95]Okay.
[45:45.29]Thanks a lot, ref.
[45:46.07]I appreciate it.
[45:53.18]Somebody is doing this on purpose.
[45:58.32]You're making me fight the huge guy?
[45:59.73]Because I won the belt?
[46:01.55]Whoever the commissioner is, they're pissed.
[46:06.23]I'm just wearing the belt.
[46:09.23]It's like a toy.
[46:10.64]What do I do about this?
[46:11.56]I can't even reach his head.
[46:30.34]Get him out of the ring.
[46:33.28]Just hit him in the head with a chair over and over again.
[46:40.08]Holy shit.
[46:40.97]I can't.
[46:41.35]I can't.
[46:41.65]Yeah, I have to.
[46:42.25]I gotta take him outside.
[46:44.59]I have to rely on weapons to beat this.
[46:52.21]Test of strength.
[46:55.65]There's no way I was ever gonna win this.
[47:15.88]That hurt my back so bad.
[47:18.96]Yeah, get the ref out of my face.
[47:20.24]Stop, stop, stop.
[47:40.41]This is unfair.
[47:45.03]It's just actually unfair.
[47:46.45]What was I supposed to do about this?
[48:02.86]I'm out of stamina.
[48:03.44]I can't even run.
[48:12.27]God damn it.
[48:16.80]What am I doing?
[48:17.86]It's like talking shit.
[48:34.47]OK, you got more attitude.
[48:50.12]You can do proceed to match.
[48:52.12]Yeah, but I just, I have to go and just attack people.
[48:54.76]It just happens.
[48:59.40]I made, oh no, I lost.
[49:00.98]Yeah, see the prop.
[49:01.88]It's $350 every time to take that stupid microphone out.
[49:04.47]Alright, get me out of here.
[49:07.61]Give me the hotel.
[49:13.29]Sorry to see you lose to Eugene.
[49:14.73]That knocked your profile down to 70%.
[49:18.43]Yeah, well, you could have helped, couldn't you?
[49:23.81]So you lost another match, the gnat.
[49:25.17]That brings your win rate down to 67%.
[49:29.52]One of you two has the math wrong, and I don't know who to make fun of.
[49:31.74]So, fuck both of you.
[49:34.08]What's that sound?
[49:40.72]Still got this, don't I?
[49:41.77]Still got this.
[49:47.55]Mm-hmm.
[49:49.35]Chumps.
[49:56.95]Wait.
[49:57.87]Give me the... Yeah.
[50:04.16]It's taunting everybody.
[50:08.20]What a little shit.
[50:14.18]Hey!
[50:14.70]Whoever can grab this out of my hands gets to keep it!
[50:24.34]Nobody.
[50:30.88]I just saw a stool in the bar, if that's what you're looking for.
[50:39.48]No.
[50:40.62]I wasn't looking for a stool.
[50:41.76]Hey, by the way, you look like you're struggling.
[50:45.66]Do you need a ride to the hospital?
[50:47.58]Do I?
[50:55.98]Should I go?
[50:57.44]Yeah?
[51:01.34]Don't worry.
[51:03.68]I'll get you to the hospital as fast as I can.
[51:08.73]What's the matter with me?
[51:09.55]With my hand?
[51:21.74]Okay, this is the doctor, right?
[51:23.70]Can I... Doctor.
[51:24.66]Can you give me a heal or something?
[51:35.13]Just sleep in the bed?
[51:41.35]Why are people doing that?
[51:42.28]Okay, I'm going to bed.
[51:45.34]My attitude is down for no reason.
[51:47.82]Do you get more health if you sleep in the hospital?
[51:56.41]Yeah, it looks like he was going to attack me.
[51:59.43]43%.
[51:59.75]Alright.
[52:00.27]New tag team champions.
[52:06.50]Released.
[52:09.12]Okay.
[52:11.68]Okay.
[52:13.60]Okay.
[52:17.56]Oh, shit.
[52:18.86]An ad has been booked to face Scratch in an inter-championship match on the fourth week of May.
[52:24.75]Alright.
[52:26.98]I gotta get ready.
[52:29.82]Nothing scheduled.
[52:30.54]Alright, this is where I can make up... Let me... So I'm in the hospital.
[52:34.68]Let me get some... Let me make... Let me get some health.
[52:36.65]I could probably sleep again, couldn't I?
[52:39.85]Let me eat first.
[52:41.33]I'm gonna open these presents.
[52:43.09]That's money.
[52:44.09]I'll take like 400 bucks for no reason.
[52:52.87]Alright, sleep.
[53:03.66]Okay, I'm alright then.
[53:06.46]The NPCs are so scary.
[53:10.14]I'm kind of bleeding money, though.
[53:13.43]Alright.
[53:16.71]Lost weight.
[53:19.93]Okay.
[53:23.01]Todd Snorting has been released.
[53:28.05]Steel Cage... Oh, wait.
[53:29.79]This is Tag Team versus Eugene's team.
[53:37.87]Alright.
[53:38.03]Let me get a little bit of revenge here.
[53:42.47]Let's just go right to it.
[53:47.68]This time I actually have... Me and Android!
[53:49.34]I actually have the skateboard this time.
[53:54.68]This is a pretty good team.
[53:55.32]Android's actually really good.
[54:05.82]Can I take the skateboard into the cave?
[54:12.68]This is really fucking dangerous.
[54:28.35]That was pretty cool.
[54:33.46]Do a kickflip.
[54:39.96]How do you do a kickflip?
[54:40.54]It's Leon, Locke, and Eugene.
[54:53.10]Wait, this is the guy at the table that I beat up in the very beginning that I thought he was a VIP, right?
[55:22.21]He's not even in the cage.
[55:39.45]This is not illegal what I'm doing, by the way.
[55:49.14]How is this not... How is this allowed?

[64:38.91]Yep.
[64:41.69]The androids is not supposed to be here.
[64:44.46]Okay.
[64:48.60]Your character is so annoying.
[64:57.71]Here I'm a missing 450 splash compilation video.
[65:02.33]I forgot just how unbelievable this game really is.
[65:07.88]It's just so unbelievable.
[65:09.10]I want to wish you luck in your match tonight, Nat.
[65:11.86]Okay.
[65:16.67]After all, dangerous things happen back here, and it would be a shame if you ended up crawling to the ring.
[65:24.50]But neither of us want that, right?
[65:26.04]So hand over $760 and I'll let you live.
[65:28.56]You're not even worth my time.
[65:37.04]I'll get you when you least expect it.
[65:38.30]I'm not going to give you $1,000 almost.
[65:41.54]For what?
[65:53.19]Non-title.
[65:53.65]This is a first blood match versus Ackwright.
[65:57.26]I gotta be careful.
[65:57.84]Have you noticed I've been bleeding every single match from the very beginning?
[66:02.32]Okay, I got pretty good health.
[66:21.96]What's up?
[66:26.56]You want that?
[66:31.77]Is it good?
[66:34.57]I didn't... I was trying to put the... I was trying to put the belt back on.
[66:45.66]It just caused mayhem.
[66:50.28]Alright, well, I'm not messing around.
[66:57.73]Restroom?
[66:59.83]Oh, there's food in here.
[67:05.67]How do I just lose agility?
[67:19.47]It's unhealthy.
[67:20.43]Wasn't it water?
[67:22.82]Get down before someone gets hurt.
[67:25.34]OK, I'll get down.
[67:28.62]Yeah, you can't put that in the compilation.
[67:34.68]Oh, it's not my time yet.
[67:47.15]I'm going out there with a... I'm going out there with a desk.
[68:02.66]Wait, until it's my time.
[68:03.90]What about your belt?
[68:04.84]Oh, who cares about the belt?
[68:12.27]The belt's mine.
[68:12.89]It doesn't matter who's carrying it.
[68:20.59]I own that belt.
[68:28.50]I gotta get rid of the microphones.
[68:29.76]I'm bleeding money.
[68:34.91]Is this the championship match or no?
[68:36.47]That was his first blood.
[68:37.73]Alright, my goal is to get something heavy and throw it right in their face in the very beginning.
[68:46.92]You know what I'm saying?
[68:48.48]Like, throw the iPad directly into the mouth and instantly burst blood.
[68:52.97]Or the chair.
[68:53.55]That would probably cause blood first, right?
[68:58.77]Yeah.
[69:00.25]Horizontal in the teeth.
[69:03.06]Go line it up.
[69:17.57]It's going to be immediate.
[69:18.73]Go ahead.
[69:21.85]Start talking.
[69:23.97]And, Akride, I'm sure you're very excited to be standing in the ring with a champion like me.
[69:32.38]But we both know that you do not belong here, so there's no point in making this match for the title.
[69:39.80]Think of yourself as my sparring partner, and perhaps you'll benefit from the experience I'm offering you.
[69:47.92]Don't patronize me, The Gnat.
[69:49.46]We both know why you're scared to put your title on the line.
[69:56.68]Shit.
[70:02.78]Blood!
[70:05.43]Blood!
[70:08.77]Wait, I am bleeding too.
[70:10.37]What?
[70:11.23]What is that?
[70:11.57]How do we...
[70:16.77]I thought it was first blood.
[70:26.99]What?
[70:27.25]What exploded?
[70:28.61]What happened?
[70:30.13]What's going on?
[70:30.73]The iPad blew up in my face.
[70:34.03]I'm alright.
[70:34.39]It's alright.
[70:34.73]I'm fine, fine, fine.
[70:36.03]How is that not blood?
[70:38.89]I'm so confused.
[70:44.50]How do I... It's... There is a lot of blood on the ground.
[70:47.89]It has to be an... Oh.
[71:01.84]So, okay.
[71:11.33]So...
[71:14.01]So he's bleeding.
[71:21.68]An explosive went off in my face, and there was blood pouring on the ground, and I fell by one.
[71:44.59]What happened?
[71:46.49]Why are the lights off?
[71:56.74]Let me give the audience a show for a second.
[72:15.25]Why is it?
[72:15.91]Who cut the lights?
[72:23.54]Here we go.
[72:24.88]Alright.
[72:32.04]I didn't know this was the worst promotion.
[72:40.86]Again, $149 for the mic.
[72:41.38]I got 10 grand.
[72:52.73]Um, there was a landmine desk.
[72:58.99]I guess.
[72:59.35]I saw you get smashed with that desk.
[73:13.10]Hope you're feeling better now.
[73:14.12]I mean, I feel alright.
[73:18.74]I was shaking my hand.
[73:22.06]Are we hugging?
[73:23.28]Oh, okay.
[73:23.62]He's a friend.
[73:24.00]Alright.
[73:30.26]Where's the owner?
[73:30.74]I want to talk to you.
[73:32.42]I want to talk to the owner.
[73:34.38]I hope that's not the owner.
[73:36.30]Are you the owner?
[73:43.25]Who owns this place?
[73:52.54]Should I not be in here?
[73:53.76]It looks like they're working something out in here.
[73:58.69]Oh, that's Lionel of the Mountain.
[73:59.83]Alright, I'm just going to go to sleep.
[74:13.50]Get a good night, Ritz.
[74:22.00]Why are you tracking me?
[74:23.16]What's going on?
[74:24.20]What?
[74:28.47]What?
[74:28.69]Alright, hotel time.
[74:41.85]I want to go for the world championship.
[74:47.30]I think I can get it.
[74:52.51]She fell off the bench.
[74:57.62]Don't I have a title match coming up?
[74:59.68]What?
[75:15.29]Evan Gillette could not be woken from his sleep this morning.
[75:19.31]The 57-year-old veteran is thought to have died of natural causes.
[75:23.25]Okay, that's too bad.
[75:34.95]Stage a special tribute memory of Evan Gillette.
[75:37.29]Prior to the public show, a private funeral will take place at 5 p.m.
[75:42.58]Okay.
[75:46.13]5 p.m.?
[75:49.49]At the cemetery?
[75:54.05]Sounds like right now.
[75:55.13]So I gotta go.
[75:55.45]Get up!
[75:56.61]Where's the cemetery?
[76:10.94]Okay, it's... Gym Cemetery or Airport Cemetery?
[76:21.96]Where is it?
[76:23.30]Hospital Cemetery?
[76:27.64]Where's the... Where is it?
[76:30.34]It's... Hospital is... All the way to the net behind the gym?
[76:34.61]Is it this way?
[76:36.17]There it is.
[76:40.43]Is that it?
[76:41.67]No, this is underground.
[76:45.07]Shit, it's the other side.
[76:45.79]Go!
[76:49.76]Take the... I don't... Leave the belt.
[76:51.24]I've got a funeral to go to.
[76:52.68]Go, go, go, go, go.
[76:53.50]Hurry.
[76:53.70]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[77:10.80]Oops.
[77:12.42]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[77:14.20]Get out of the way.
[77:14.62]Get out of the way.
[77:15.00]Get out of the way.
[77:15.38]I'm sorry.
[77:17.34]I can see in the mirror where I am.
[77:20.15]I gotta go to a funeral.
[77:21.81]Where is it?
[77:26.25]Okay, here we go.
[77:30.66]Thanks for attending the funeral.
[77:31.92]Evan Gillette would be happy to see this turnout.
[77:34.58]Before anybody says anything in public at tonight's show, we thought it might be more appropriate to gather here.
[77:47.88]He would have also wanted your lives to go on.
[77:49.63]He would want the show to go on.
[77:50.89]Okay.
[77:52.47]Okay.
[77:54.43]Okay.
[77:54.59]Come into that.
[78:21.04]Where's, um... Where's the... Which casket is his?
[78:28.71]It's okay.
[78:33.90]I'm just shaking everybody's hands.
[78:50.69]Put it down.
[78:51.39]That guy has the tombstone.
[78:53.79]That guy has the tombstone.
[78:57.94]That's- I would put that down, please.
[79:03.68]I'm not gonna start anything.
[79:04.96]Can I play a song?
[79:21.05]Keep it up.
[79:21.47]Alright!
[79:29.85]He's in a hot dog.
[79:45.84]Wait, there was a little altercation over here.
[79:53.15]I like to keep my friends close to my enemies.
[79:54.50]Now all I see is you suffering, and I'm glad I don't have to keep the pretense anymore.
[80:17.05]Don't worry, I'll take care of Blonde Blunder for you.
[80:21.93]That's not this guy's name.
[80:24.13]This guy's name is Scratch, not the Blonde Blunder.
[80:28.45]Who is he referring to?
[80:34.52]Can we find the Blonde Blunder?
[80:36.54]I don't see a person here named Blonde Blunder.
[80:50.51]I mean, the guy with the blonde hair?
[80:54.79]No.
[80:56.77]Who else has blonde hair?
[80:58.74]Not you.
[80:59.20]Is it you?
[81:01.24]I don't know who this guy is protecting me from.
[81:08.10]No, it's my broom.
[81:17.41]You can't have it.
[81:19.29]No!
[81:19.75]It's not for sale!
[81:21.73]I found it and it's mine!
[81:43.43]That guy's got adrenaline from being on the phone.
[81:50.44]Okay, I think that's good.
[81:52.11]We did the funerals over.
[81:53.25]It's okay.
[81:58.23]It's time for the match?
[81:59.15]I have a match today?
[82:04.81]Against one of these people here?
[82:06.91]I have a match.
[82:24.19]Give me that.
[82:35.57]This is so big.
[82:41.49]Heard you crapped yourself?
[82:44.47]When?
[82:58.22]Let's go.
[83:00.88]I'll deal with you on the first week of June.
[83:02.56]Get out of my sight and prepare.
[83:04.38]Alright, bring it on.
[83:23.02]I made it.
[83:25.56]What?
[83:28.50]This show is dedicated to the memory of Evan Gillette who recently passed away.
[83:31.70]Yeah?
[83:36.80]Evan Gillette's work in this ring meant a lot to fans.
[83:40.86]But the person was backstage.
[83:43.49]What's happening?
[83:44.73]What's happening?
[83:46.97]What's happening?
[83:47.73]We're not in a ring.
[83:59.72]Who am I versus?
[84:01.36]There's no one here.
[84:21.23]There's nobody here!
[84:23.06]There's nobody even here!
[84:25.04]What's happening?
[84:35.86]What?
[84:39.91]Okay.
[84:41.73]I guess we'll just wait till we get there.
[84:47.14]Hey, don't forget that's my belt back there.
[84:49.46]Doesn't matter who has it.
[84:50.92]It's like a library card.
[84:52.06]I fucking own the book.
[84:53.30]You're just cashing it out.
[84:54.60]Wait.
[85:12.17]Yeah, that was easy.
[85:13.79]This is a Three Stooges routine.
[85:41.70]I'm gonna beat the shit out of this guy.
[85:44.04]Once I get out of this, I'll be okay.
[85:55.18]Oh, great.
[86:02.16]At least I'm holding the belt.
[86:03.04]That's all I care about.
[86:13.14]No, no, no, no.
[86:14.48]Okay, now I got you, motherfucker.
[86:19.17]Sit in your seat.
[86:20.77]Sit back in your seat.
[86:22.99]Sit back in your seat.
[86:27.07]Sit down.
[86:29.71]Sit down.
[86:30.41]Oh, that's real, real cute.
[86:33.46]Okay.
[86:43.67]Just sitting down.
[86:44.93]Okay.
[86:45.05]Alright.
[86:46.07]Hit me in the back of the head.
[86:52.55]He caught me.
[87:02.20]No!
[87:02.58]Give me that.
[87:08.24]Give me that!
[87:16.82]This guy just keeps scooping me up.
[87:19.14]How?
[87:21.38]I'm not going to let him win.
[87:22.42]No way.
[87:22.88]I can't.
[87:29.03]This guy is so hard to knock down.
[87:31.27]Oh, shit.
[87:36.06]Thanks.
[87:48.70]Why are you pinning this guy for no reason?
[88:03.79]Grab him!
[88:04.09]Grab him!
[88:04.37]Grab him!
[88:04.69]Grab him!
[88:05.03]Grab him!
[88:05.37]Grab him!
[88:07.61]Grab him!
[88:17.50]Yeah, how is this a memorial match?
[88:22.81]I think we were scheduled to have the memorial match, but then he just hates me and is fighting me on the plane.
[88:27.71]Fine, I'll grab this.
[88:42.24]You are in the way!
[88:43.14]Get out of the way!
[88:52.69]Oh my god.
[88:53.51]What is this?
[89:10.44]Is this a piece of glass?
[89:16.74]You've ruined everything.
[89:17.64]That would've been so cool.
[89:27.47]Don't.
[89:40.50]I'm so weak.
[89:46.16]Yeah.
[89:48.84]This is the worst memorial match I've ever, ever seen.
[89:58.42]It's just two people trying to hurt each other.
[90:00.98]Trying to do permanent damage to each other.
[90:10.09]Oh my god, get off of me!
[90:14.73]Let's get out of the seat.
[90:28.44]Alright, I got the upper hand now.
[90:37.71]Oh my god!
[90:38.85]You have to be kidding me.
[90:46.96]Get up!
[90:49.37]Oh my...
[91:03.69]When did we get off the plane?
[91:17.90]We're still in the air.
[91:31.13]Where is he going?
[91:42.26]So much blood.
[92:08.92]The Nat has damaged the reputation of Wrestling Revolution by failing to win that inter-promotional contest.
[92:15.56]That was very bizarre.
[92:20.58]That was a very strange day.
[92:26.36]That was his client.
[92:31.12]Okay.
[92:36.25]I mean, I gotta get out of Wrestling Revolution then.
[92:53.02]Alright, no more messing around.
[92:58.10]Actually get to full health.
[93:00.99]Back to the hotel room.
[93:04.45]You gotta make Miku.
[93:06.91]Well, we're currently invested in the nap.
[93:10.73]We will make Miku.
[93:15.50]But I need to see how this arc ends.
[93:21.72]He's still carrying around the tombstone.
[93:23.26]Yeah, that's not messed up at all.
[93:31.63]Come down with an illness.
[93:36.65]Wait, what?
[93:39.81]Speaking Tour has been fired in controversy after sharing some inflammatory views with his students.
[93:45.08]Okay.
[93:46.00]Okay.
[93:54.91]Oh, this is important.
[93:55.93]This is versus, um, this is versus Scratch.
[93:59.59]Okay.
[94:00.26]This is the title match.
[94:03.34]I can't screw this up.
[94:08.92]Just give me a water.
[94:11.56]Give me, uh, something to drink.
[94:16.60]Careful.
[94:20.08]Listen to Nat, a lot has changed since we first signed you to 1400 per week.
[94:25.05]Uh-huh.
[94:27.97]We all have to make sacrifices to stay afloat.
[94:29.83]So how would you feel about taking a pay cut?
[94:38.34]I'm the champion right now.
[94:39.44]You're gonna pay cut the champion?
[94:41.68]No.
[94:43.52]That's not happening.
[94:45.94]We'll find some other way to balance the books.
[94:49.37]I'm the champion.
[94:50.25]I am the intercontinental champion.
[94:56.63]Are you seriously going to talk to me like that?
[94:58.71]Alright, full health.
[95:03.92]Alright, get me out of here.
[95:17.56]Don't do anything dumb.
[95:18.95]Don't provoke anybody on the street.
[95:20.73]Don't fight anybody.
[95:21.79]Just leave the belt.
[95:27.05]Don't provoke anybody.
[95:27.89]Okay.
[95:33.87]Anything in the gym I could use.
[95:35.83]I could train.
[95:37.51]What do I have for stats right now?
[95:39.75]No, no.
[95:40.29]I'll try on an off day.
[95:42.67]Conference is starting in the press room.
[95:49.79]There's more to this business than what takes place in the ring, the gnat.
[95:53.55]Uh-huh.
[95:57.49]Why don't you join us for a drink to unwind?
[95:59.85]It probably wouldn't cost more than $100.
[96:01.57]I have a match in 40 minutes.
[96:05.11]Alright, fine.
[96:08.31]It can't hurt.
[96:22.26]What?
[96:22.94]What happened to my health?
[96:25.53]I'm on my way to the studio.
[96:26.49]Do you need a ride?
[96:27.23]Um... Yeah, I... Yes.
[96:33.37]I'll go with you.
[96:33.89]Please take me to the studio.
[96:36.69]No problem.
[96:37.05]Just follow me and I'll get you to the studio as soon as possible.
[96:54.98]Alright, I want an interview.
[97:00.16]I want an interview before the game.
[97:04.20]Let me sit in this chair.
[97:06.14]You look exhausted.
[97:07.64]Why don't you take a nap while there's still time?
[97:10.06]Can you guys stop telling me what to do today?
[97:13.15]This is a sham.
[97:17.65]Oh, come get drunk an hour before the match.
[97:21.11]Hey, dude, you should take a nap 20 minutes before the match.
[97:23.75]They want me to lose.
[97:29.25]This is a league-wide conspiracy.
[97:56.01]Okay.
[97:56.75]Welcome to this inter-championship clash between Scratch and The Gnat.
[98:04.32]Scratch, could you start us off on how you intend to cope with The Gnat?
[98:09.00]I got drunk before a title match.
[98:13.02]The Gnat is in no state to compete, and I won't be taking it easy on him.
[98:18.97]You think I'm going to go easy on you?
[98:21.35]How do you respond?
[98:27.60]I earn more than Scratch, and I'll prove why I'm worth every penny.
[98:35.34]This has the potential to be the best match on the card, so buy your ticket to see it live.
[98:47.07]Oh, it's time.
[98:47.59]Okay.
[98:48.55]Wait!
[98:57.32]I have to... This is a title match.
[98:58.65]I can't mess this up.
[99:13.92]Food?
[99:15.16]Tombstone.
[99:16.16]Alright.
[99:17.02]This is huge if I can go out there with this.
[99:28.19]You lucky bastard.
[99:30.83]Okay, that's like one of the most popular people in the world.
[99:33.19]I almost just ruined everything.
[99:52.83]As you may have heard in the news, my contract with Wrestling Revolution expires next week.
[100:01.59]If Chef Buffalo and I can't come to an agreement, this might very well be my last appearance.
[100:07.28]In case that happens, I want to take this opportunity to express how much I've enjoyed.
[100:10.36]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[100:26.61]He's got something to prove, I don't.
[100:42.48]One, two, three.
[100:54.71]Okay.
[100:56.51]Just do moves.
[100:58.11]Do moves.
[100:58.65]Get set up.
[101:02.29]Good.
[101:09.04]I'm getting fucked up.
[101:09.74]No, I'm not.
[101:10.12]I just did like three moves in a row.
[101:14.61]But that was unfair.
[101:15.23]I just got, like, scooped up.
[101:33.88]He's ripping off your head.
[101:34.80]I'm fine.
[101:36.60]I'm alright.
[101:39.82]Come on.
[101:40.38]Don't be like this.
[101:47.20]If you win this, can you play Fortnite?
[101:48.42]I'm never playing Fortnite ever again.
[101:51.72]That's never happening ever again.
[101:55.64]Put that down.
[101:56.14]That's illegal.
[102:02.40]I put it down on the ground and he hit my head into it.
[102:05.02]While it was falling, I fell on top of it with his hand on my head.
[102:08.54]This is getting ugly.
[102:15.99]We might have to go with the strat.
[102:17.65]And the strat is just make him come outside and beat him with a weapon until he's dead.
[102:22.23]That's the strat.
[102:37.54]God damn it!
[102:41.32]He was so much more prepared than I was.
[103:00.69]God, get him off.
[103:19.03]Oh my God, he's going to beat me.
[103:20.57]I'm going to lose the title.
[103:22.29]No, I'm not.
[103:30.04]I grabbed him and he reversed it immediately!
[103:32.36]What are you doing?
[103:46.89]Who's doing what?
[103:49.27]Go outside the ring?
[103:56.88]Okay, here we go, guys.
[103:58.44]It's time for me to win a match in Wrestling Revolution.
[104:02.47]Run outside.
[104:07.89]That's what happens every time.
[104:20.93]He's smart.
[104:21.75]He's much smarter than anybody else I've fought.
[104:25.80]He's not taking the bait here.
[104:28.54]He's too smart.
[104:40.94]Good.
[104:52.79]Oh no.
[104:55.23]Why would you let your head be that vulnerable?
[105:11.18]Catch your breath.
[105:12.22]He's not coming in yet.
[105:17.30]Five minutes.
[105:26.56]I'm just trying to get some punches in.
[105:28.83]He's got so much more reach than I do.
[105:30.31]Look at his arms.
[105:31.13]His arms and legs are so much taller.
[105:32.47]It's not fair.
[105:45.77]He missed.
[105:46.51]That's good.
[105:53.84]You're so bad at this.
[105:54.80]This character is four feet tall.
[105:59.04]I can't do anything.
[106:09.11]I have to get out of the ring.
[106:15.53]How's that not a rope break?
[106:16.59]I'm right here.
[106:17.15]Alright, we're good.
[106:19.65]We're good.
[106:19.89]We're okay.
[106:34.65]Three minutes.
[106:35.11]Four minutes.
[106:55.55]Get him!
[106:57.29]More pressure on the neck.
[106:58.51]More pressure on his neck.
[107:01.70]Was I in that?
[107:04.82]How did I get caught by that?
[107:17.83]You reverse every move I do.
[107:21.30]I'm going to get a weapon.
[107:25.48]He reversed it again!
[107:40.83]Reversed again?
[107:41.47]Get the pin, get the pin, the pin, pin, pin, pin!
[108:00.86]You reversed the pin, didn't you?
[108:03.68]Oh, this is bad.
[108:04.60]Zero health.
[108:11.08]Referee's not in here, though, so that's good.
[108:17.10]Come on.
[108:23.04]Who am I doing...
[108:40.67]How did that miss?
[108:41.67]There's no way it missed.
[108:48.41]He hit his head on it.
[108:49.27]Uh-oh.
[108:57.74]Uh-oh.
[109:10.31]He counts six twice?
[109:14.78]It's over.
[109:15.18]I'm going to lose the title.
[109:19.80]It still counts.
[109:25.77]I have to pin him.
[109:26.51]I have to pin him.
[109:27.13]I have to pin him.
[109:28.33]What if it's a tie?
[109:28.99]I don't lose the title, right?
[109:54.33]Don't!
[110:00.74]Oh, it's anybody's game!
[110:06.34]You want this, motherfucker?
[110:08.56]You want this?
[110:12.16]You want this?
[110:14.12]You're gonna have to take it out of my cold, dead hands!
[110:18.82]What?
[110:19.40]Oh, that's... What happens?
[110:23.81]No wind.
[110:32.66]Sorry, you don't win.
[110:51.08]I get to keep the title.
[110:57.11]You can't lift that.
[110:57.81]Why?
[111:21.79]Why does it have 10 minutes on the clock?
[111:23.99]Yeah.
[111:40.16]Fuck you.
[111:40.54]You didn't win the title.
[111:42.64]Stop.
[111:42.96]Why are you doing this?
[111:45.47]What?
[111:52.62]That guy told me that I was not going to be alive after this, didn't he?
[111:55.54]Or was that somebody else?
[111:59.14]Wait, why did your profile rise?
[112:05.39]By the way, how much money does Scratch make?
[112:07.63]Because I make $1,400.
[112:08.77]And that was all of my argument, was I made way more money.
[112:13.25]How much more money do I make than Scratch?
[112:22.98]Why would we know?
[112:24.05]It would have just said it, wouldn't it?
[112:25.13]That was pay-per-view.
[112:34.39]Alright.
[112:38.26]Still the champion.
[112:40.66]I can't believe I won the championship in the second match.
[112:42.70]Why was I even given a title match?
[112:48.53]Oh, you wrapped that gift for me?
[112:51.69]Really?
[112:53.58]I appreciate that.
[112:54.20]Thanks.
[113:13.79]How much is it costing a lot of money to keep this thing with me at all times?
[113:24.25]These are my friends, right?
[113:26.33]That's why we're sharing the hotel room.
[113:30.01]I need... I want... This is my... I need... How do I wake up the android?
[113:37.67]It's good to see you.
[113:40.93]But can I sleep in the bed, please?
[113:50.81]I don't want to hurt you.
[113:55.15]What?
[113:56.75]Why?
[113:57.27]I need to sleep in the bed.
[113:58.38]I need to sleep.
[114:00.60]Get down.
[114:18.83]Did he say, what did he say?
[114:20.27]There's a cardboard box at the airport?
[114:23.39]Who cares?
[114:24.64]Who cares?
[114:25.36]If that's what you're looking for.
[114:32.32]Don't wake me up.
[114:34.10]There's a cardboard box.
[114:40.95]You know, if that's what you're looking for.
[114:47.90]Mike Duranus.
[114:50.84]Okay.
[114:55.78]Only 57%.
[114:56.50]A lot of releases.
[115:05.99]A lot of free agents.
[115:13.58]Okay.
[115:13.88]Okay.
[115:16.43]Four-man furniture smash.
[115:20.77]Tables.
[115:23.27]No title match.
[115:23.85]Alright.
[115:24.15]So I need... Oh, someone left me a present.
[115:28.55]Who left it?
[115:33.33]What's inside of it?
[115:37.33]Thanks for the sign.
[115:44.28]Appreciate it.
[115:44.74]Thank you.
[115:50.75]Down with that sort of thing.
[115:52.13]Can you play the piano?
[115:59.38]Appreciate it.
[116:08.35]Thanks, Bill.
[116:18.07]I'm looking for the right person to pass my legacy on to.
[116:20.25]I think you have what it takes.
[116:21.21]How would you like to be the next Big Bob Orson?
[116:26.07]As your mentor, I could teach you everything I know.
[116:31.67]Is this a joke?
[116:36.19]Is this your idea of playing a little prank on the gnat, the smallest guy in the league?
[116:40.80]You think that's funny?
[116:43.22]Sure, I'll do it.
[116:47.05]Glad you're as enthusiastic about this as I am.
[116:48.83]There's nobody else I'd rather pass the torch to.
[116:50.69]Uh-huh.
[116:53.97]Cool.
[116:54.53]So now what?
[116:57.31]Okay.
[117:14.29]Big Bob Orson.
[117:20.91]I'm not big.
[117:22.89]My name's not Bob.
[117:24.95]So this is going to be very interesting.
[117:26.21]I'm wearing different clothes.
[117:40.12]Wait, I just took his look?
[117:41.58]That's it?
[117:46.18]That's all it is?
[117:46.90]It's just, oh hey, by the way, here are some clothing options.
[117:53.20]So I'm not even the gnat anymore.
[117:56.17]Get away from me.
[117:56.95]Do you like this trophy?
[118:03.47]Seems like you need it more than I do.
[118:05.17]Um... Okay.
[118:09.69]Yeah, I'll take it.
[118:12.96]You're welcome.
[118:13.54]That's what friends are for.
[118:19.93]Why did you... You backed up very, very cautiously.
[118:22.33]I'm gonna look down.
[118:22.93]It's gonna be like Looney Tunes.
[118:24.73]There's gonna be dynamite in here.
[118:28.51]Well, thanks.
[118:39.76]Changing your finishing move to the power bomb means you're finished.
[118:56.47]Um, I didn't want to do that.
[118:57.87]That was fucking fantastic.
[119:03.90]Fantastic.
[119:05.12]I'm so happy that I did that.
[119:06.28]I'm very happy.
[119:15.23]No, I want to... Can't you use it?
[119:18.01]How do I use it?
[119:21.85]How do you use this?
[119:23.31]Oh my god.
[119:43.90]The Gnat with Big Bob Orson.
[119:46.72]Just dressed in the same clothes.
[119:49.35]It's just Mini-Me.
[119:54.05]I will call him Mini-Me.
[120:05.98]I'm pleased to confirm that I will now be wrestling under the watchful eye of Big Bob Orson.
[120:13.69]My rookie days are over.
[120:14.69]It's time to get serious, and I couldn't ask for a better person to guide me.
[120:21.80]Everybody knows that hired help is a sign that somebody can't cope on their own.
[120:29.09]All the help in the world can't prevent you from losing to me right now.
[120:39.64]What is this match?
[120:42.80]What?
[120:43.68]Wait, what happened?
[120:46.48]What happened?
[120:48.18]Did we lose?
[120:49.48]What team am I on?
[120:52.91]I don't even know what... I don't even know what team I'm on.
[120:55.95]That guy's eliminated too?
[120:59.01]Who's team... Who's in the ring?
[121:08.46]What is going on?
[121:18.23]It's a furniture rumble?
[121:21.61]Oh.
[121:25.69]Learned that from fucking Bob Orson.
[121:35.84]So it's just everybody in the ring at the same time?
[121:39.64]Don't break the table, because I think that's how that first guy got eliminated that way, I think.
[121:46.27]What is that?
[121:48.25]What is this?
[121:51.79]Those are thumbtacks.
[121:53.41]These are thumbtacks!
[121:56.47]Holy shit, are you kidding me?
[121:58.65]Those are thumbtacks.
[122:17.43]Thank God it didn't hit me.
[122:30.88]I'm gonna tax.
[122:34.80]I'm gonna tax him.
[122:40.98]These people are so stupid.
[122:42.98]Like, you are so dumb.
[122:48.60]It didn't break.
[122:49.14]It didn't break.
[122:49.58]I'm good.
[122:49.88]I'm good.
[122:50.14]It didn't break.
[122:56.84]That's a win.
[122:57.33]I just won.
[123:04.57]Thanks.
[123:05.11]Wait.
[123:05.59]Thanks, Scally, for coming in and helping me.
[123:08.39]I have no idea what's going on.
[123:13.91]I just know that I won.
[123:17.88]Oh, that's Bob.
[123:18.40]I'm sorry, Bob.
[123:18.92]That was a mess.
[123:39.23]Okay, that was for the title.
[123:42.50]That has cemented his reign by defending the interchampionship.
[123:45.20]Okay, their profile suffered.
[123:47.96]Yep.
[123:49.10]Oh, I mean, he jumped out of the ring and landed on his back through a table.
[123:52.84]Of course he's going to lose popularity.
[123:54.31]That was dumb.
[123:54.95]That was really dumb.
[123:59.01]Okay.
[124:04.43]Oh, I have to pay management now.
[124:17.25]So let me get this right.
[124:17.87]He came in to help.
[124:19.33]Is that what it was?
[124:20.01]Didn't I already have Bob Orson though?
[124:27.81]Go to the barber.
[124:28.43]Where's the barber?
[124:30.87]Uh, next to the bar.
[124:49.80]Okay.
[124:55.07]Who's the barber?
[125:05.97]Are you the barber?
[125:07.59]Oh.
[125:30.57]won't let me I think I dedicated my whole character arc to bob orson so I can't do anything
[125:45.63]Hey Andrew, I just want to let you know... You should probably face the desk the other way.
[125:50.55]This is a terrible reception desk.
[125:53.50]Should be over here.
[126:01.36]What are you doing out this late?
[126:03.48]Shut up.
[126:12.74]Nevermind.
[126:14.57]Actually, it is pretty late, isn't it?
[126:29.10]Phone?
[126:36.26]Where's the phone?
[126:37.12]Oh, whatever.
[126:37.52]Just go to bed.
[126:52.53]There's a lot of people that are in this hotel room now.
[126:54.69]There's like four of us.
[126:55.85]I keep adding people to the house.
[127:13.44]This is another championship versus guild.
[127:15.04]Ah, okay.
[127:20.58]I'm not messing around.
[127:21.44]I'm going to defend the title.
[127:22.84]I actually think this character is pretty strong.
[127:48.53]Wait, Bob Horson comes out with me every time.
[127:50.21]I am so small.
[127:53.13]This is so weird.
[128:00.70]This is weird, isn't it?
[128:18.55]Hey, Gil, can you believe that we've been booked to face each other in this match?
[128:23.25]Things could get awkward, but I hope you appreciate that I can't go easy on you just because we're friends.
[128:27.43]Oh, that's right.
[128:27.91]We're friends.
[128:30.88]Don't worry.
[128:31.20]I wouldn't have it any other way.
[128:32.32]I can't afford to lose this match either.
[128:42.23]Get him.
[128:49.06]This character is so bad.
[128:51.35]Everything is reversed.
[129:26.79]Gil's too strong.
[129:29.59]No, this guy is just, he's too small.
[129:34.19]That's an advantage right there, I think.
[129:35.35]Alright, here we go.
[129:37.17]Wrestle time.
[129:47.89]If I lose this title match, I'm going to retire this guy and make Miku.
[130:03.17]Stop reversing everything!
[130:31.40]What, you're rooting against me?
[130:33.82]Lose lose lose.
[130:35.68]Put me in the middle of the ring.
[130:51.39]It's comparable still.
[130:52.35]This guy walk.
[130:57.79]How do you block everything?
[131:03.43]It's over.
[131:03.73]I'm going to lose title.
[131:09.71]That's a rope break.
[131:10.35]That's a rope break.
[131:11.37]Am I alright?
[131:14.57]I just screamed.
[131:19.70]Shit, that's it.
[131:21.32]He just did his finishing move.
[131:23.42]Bob, help.
[131:25.26]Bob, do something.
[131:26.18]Bob!
[131:26.60]I just lost title.
[131:37.41]Yeah, a little too late, Bob.
[131:38.58]Thanks.
[131:39.08]Nothing.
[131:39.86]Yeah, that was a shit ref job.
[132:03.65]Get out of the...
[132:10.95]Can you help me, please?
[132:17.74]It's Miku time.
[132:18.70]Alright.
[132:41.77]Oh, you didn't help at all.
[132:43.73]Whatever.
[133:04.12]Do Miku with every stat maxed.
[133:06.12]No, that... Gotta give it a little bit of challenge.
[133:09.37]Uh-oh.
[133:13.95]We're running short of staff tonight.
[133:15.55]Would you sit in on commentary for the next match?
[133:17.33]Oh, do we have to do this first?
[133:19.73]Yeah.
[133:23.69]Okay, 630 bucks.
[133:55.13]Of this rain man.
[134:02.94]Why am I talking to a microphone over here?
[134:08.44]And that will be joining us on commentary to share his insights in this match.
[134:16.26]You know what it takes to win, so how long do you see this match going for?
[134:24.15]It's gonna take less than five minutes He heard it here first and that thinks this match will be over and soon let's find out Who's this other guy in a suit
[134:59.82]I disappeared into the crowd.
[135:11.55]Oh, there I am.
[135:18.91]This is such a little shit.
[135:21.17]I'm just supposed to be hanging out.
[135:26.65]I'm just ruining everything.
[135:39.65]This guy seriously just dodged it three times?
[136:02.35]I can't take it out of his hand.
[136:10.31]I swear this guy is just, everything gets reversed.
[136:13.06]Even when they don't even see me doing anything.
[136:16.24]I'm behind that guy.
[136:17.40]He didn't even know I was there.
[136:19.84]And I went to go hit him in the head with the bell, and he dove out of the way.
[136:27.07]By the way, I won.
[136:28.33]I was right.
[136:28.79]The winner of tonight is you, The Gnat.
[136:31.71]You predicted this match would be quick.
[136:34.45]Almost as quick as your ankle isn't gonna snap.
[136:46.03]Oh my god.
[136:46.79]This guy's so fucked up.
[137:02.86]You seem a little sore.
[137:04.02]Okay.
[137:15.09]You damaged the reputation of the... Okay.
[137:21.93]You want me?
[137:26.11]Okay.
[137:26.59]Is that the same character?
[137:29.09]No.
[137:29.91]Chef Buffalo with perfect Sean.
[137:31.45]Okay.
[137:33.39]Wait, hold on a minute.
[137:34.31]We have a confrontation with Big Bob Orson.
[137:47.30]What's this about?
[137:54.42]What's this about?
[137:55.06]Piku, you promised.
[138:02.55]I know, but this is important.
[138:04.41]This is important lore here.
[138:08.53]I'm about to have a confrontation with my mentor, the person who I took all their clothes and pretended to be them for the last three weeks.
[138:18.91]What does he want?
[138:34.26]Thanat, I've been carrying you for long.
[138:36.48]It's about time I dropped you.
[138:40.53]Sure, propping you up made me stronger, but it also held me back from everything I could be.
[138:46.28]Once I'm unchained from you, I'll be free to go as far as I want in any direction I choose.
[138:50.35]So am I supposed to just take the... You never even felt my full weight, Big Bob Morrison.
[138:55.99]You'll find it was better to be with me than against me.
[138:58.13]Can I put my old clothes back on?
[139:05.87]Doesn't say anything about no weapons.
[139:09.12]Sorry, Bob.
[139:09.70]Oh.
[139:12.72]Let's hope you got an... Take an action.
[139:20.49]There can only be one Bob Orson.
[139:22.03]I'm sorry.
[139:24.47]He's got the same idea too.
[139:26.04]One of us has to go.
[139:28.14]There can only be one Bob Orson.
[139:29.26]And it's going to be me.
[139:56.39]Oh my god!
[139:59.09]Um...
[140:30.69]Okay.
[140:31.35]Alright, everybody relax.
[140:33.49]Everybody relax.
[140:34.94]Okay.
[140:36.38]Alright.
[140:38.10]I get to be Bob Horson now, right?
[140:40.92]Zero.
[141:02.85]Oh no!
[141:03.43]Uh oh.
[141:04.09]Listen Nat, did you ever stop to think that the heat between us doesn't have to be so destructive?
[141:31.18]You just watched what I just did to Bob Orson on the backstage camera.
[141:39.52]Want to join forces?
[141:43.15]Don't I already... I have three friends already.
[141:45.63]Sorry.
[141:46.41]I don't have room for more than three friends.
[141:54.50]I'll make Mika right now.
[142:12.35]I get another title shot.
[142:13.47]Alright.
[142:17.33]Okay.
[142:19.95]Should I do it in wrestling revolution or a different one?
[142:23.40]Like, should I go into like this one or like strong style or something?
[142:29.44]Do a different one?
[142:34.58]How's this one?
[142:42.04]But wait a minute.
[142:42.76]I'm in the middle of the career with The Nat.
[142:44.92]I can't stop.
[142:46.52]Retire The Nat.
[143:08.65]Should I just... Yes, you can.
[143:11.40]Just make the Nat Miko.
[143:13.90]Can you?
[143:14.52]Can I just do that?
[143:19.78]Can I?
[143:21.08]I don't want to be in this league.
[143:30.25]I don't want to be in this league.
[143:34.23]Alright, let's retire the Nat.
[143:41.89]We're going to retire the nap.
[143:52.13]So you want to end your career.
[143:53.23]What do you mean?
[143:53.67]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[143:59.16]But I... Otherwise, I have to stay in this league.
[144:06.20]Alright.
[144:08.54]I saw a great idea.
[144:09.80]I'm going to go for it.
[144:16.07]Somebody said Nat Tsunemiku.
[144:27.21]Where is the Nat?
[144:44.72]Like this, right?
[144:59.92]How tall is Miku?
[145:29.72]Like that, right?
[146:00.49]Is that right?
[146:09.20]It's blue, right?
[146:10.06]Miko's hair is blue?
[146:33.00]What does Miku wear for clothes?
[146:35.36]It's also blue, right?
[146:40.28]It's teal.
[146:58.10]How the hell do you make teal?
[147:02.83]Like that, right?
[147:08.03]Like that?
[147:09.84]Oh shit.
[147:10.32]Alright.
[147:10.68]Thanks for the reference mods.
[147:16.42]Okay.
[147:16.64]That's good.
[147:23.49]That's a little too.
[147:28.89]Alright.
[147:29.89]Getting there.
[147:36.87]I mean, this is the best I can do guys.
[147:39.10]I can't, I can't make that hair.
[147:41.74]Do better.
[147:43.08]What?
[147:43.24]This is the best I could do.
[147:49.34]This is like gray.
[147:50.86]Does it matter?
[148:14.79]This is like, okay, this is like black, gray, and teal.
[148:17.97]Hold on, let me see if I can get a pattern.
[148:22.61]We'll make this like gray.
[148:26.67]Actually, wait, hold on.
[148:29.97]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[148:45.81]look at this look at this alright we need a it needs to be gray up on the top like gray you know what I mean it's kind of like a light gray
[149:15.56]Is that too gray?
[149:16.48]I think that's alright.
[149:17.44]Don't forget, she has a necktie?
[149:18.60]Oh!
[149:18.68]Okay, she has a necktie.
[149:20.42]Oops, wait.
[149:46.86]He's very pale.
[149:48.10]Trying to get it without it being bright.
[149:50.20]Yeah, that's not accurate at all.
[150:28.43]Maybe like 10%?
[150:28.85]It's hard.
[150:29.17]It's hard.
[150:31.89]I think it's too bright still.
[151:39.98]Shoes need to be black.
[151:40.96]Okay.
[151:43.32]Okay.
[151:53.80]I kind of like... I like this one.
[151:58.45]I like this one.
[152:12.04]Which one?
[152:15.44]Five?
[152:17.96]Seven?
[152:22.21]Or... Five?
[152:24.63]Do you think five is... Yeah, alright, we're staying with five.
[152:27.03]Alright, let me fix the shoes.
[152:39.03]Hold on, it's...
[152:59.59]Okay.
[153:00.67]What headphones are?
[153:02.03]Oh, that's right.
[153:02.59]Okay.
[153:04.35]Alright.
[153:22.59]So how big is Miku?
[153:30.73]How tall is Miku supposed to be?
[153:33.77]She's like five feet tall?
[153:37.33]Okay, I got a necktie.
[153:41.04]I'll do the necktie.
[153:43.02]Alright, I'll do 5'2".
[153:45.52]How tall is Miku?
[153:46.26]Miku is 5'2".
[153:47.44]This is a Wish.com Miku figurine.
[154:00.19]I'll just keep this here.
[154:01.21]OK, now we need.
[154:04.31]The music has to be accurate.
[154:21.36]It's gonna be very fast.
[154:37.07]I think this is the right one.
[154:41.87]Bask, disco.
[154:42.65]Okay.
[154:57.56]Alright, now what about these?
[155:04.54]Popularity, I mean,
[155:07.50]I'm pretty sure this is at least 80%.
[155:15.02]no no no no no no I disagree I'd say it's like I'd say it's like 82 but like let's say 85 I mean you know why I know this because when I opened up the hatsune miku cross game um there were like a dozen people that just said cringe and they were mad at me so I mean it's it's like 90
[155:43.02]Do 100 strength.
[155:44.06]No!
[155:44.56]No 100 strength!
[155:45.68]Put the attitude up.
[155:52.08]75... 80... 75... This is too strong.
[155:58.14]75 and everything, except for popularity.
[156:04.08]Strength would be 99.
[156:14.82]No, I want it to be a challenge.
[156:18.25]We'll do 78% and then 72.
[156:20.23]There we go.
[156:23.05]That's better.
[156:23.97]That's better.
[156:26.19]Stop nerfing her.
[156:27.15]Hey, we're fine.
[156:29.97]I gotta fix the rest of this.
[156:37.23]Or is it over-counter?
[156:38.16]Yeah.
[156:43.66]This is blue too, right?
[156:46.55]I think this one's more accurate.
[157:24.07]Like that
[157:51.84]That's kind of like that.
[157:52.86]It's like... Is that accurate?
[157:57.47]I think so.
[157:58.15]Whatever.
[158:24.58]So now, how is this Natsunamiku?
[158:31.76]It's just Hatsunamiku.
[158:58.29]This is a bunch of tattoos.
[159:00.65]Oh, you need the headphones, alright.
[159:02.25]Okay.
[159:31.54]Alright, I think that's good enough.
[159:32.98]But this still is Bob Orson's stuff.
[159:37.38]Oh, shit, hold on.
[159:39.86]It still wants us to be Bob Orson.
[159:41.34]Uh, whatever, this is fine.
[160:15.69]Um, okay Okay Alright, that's good
[161:06.74]Okay, wait, I can change the promotion.
[161:08.58]Should I?
[161:08.88]Should I change the promotion?
[161:13.46]I'm going to change the promotion.
[161:14.48]Let's go.
[161:14.82]How about let's go in the big leagues?
[161:17.84]All-American wrestling?
[161:24.47]Alright.
[161:24.75]I think we're good to go.
[161:35.76]I think so.
[161:36.16]I won in the biggest one because that's where all the is.
[161:45.46]Look, look at the stats.
[161:50.21]If Natsu and Miku's stats are gonna be this good, then... We're gonna be in the big leagues.
[162:02.64]Alright!
[162:04.84]We can copy and paste outfits, so... Wait, so does that mean... Why am I still fighting Gil?! !
[162:21.68]Okay, 21.
[162:22.82]What?
[162:35.95]Fuck this guy.
[162:36.45]I don't work for him anymore.
[162:50.67]Oh boy.
[162:50.99]Alright, let's go.
[163:04.73]There's no match right now.
[163:06.17]Oh, that's right.
[163:08.31]There is a match right now.
[163:13.42]A new phone!
[163:20.31]I gotta get out of here.
[163:21.31]Yeah?
[163:29.24]Oh, really?
[163:29.90]Give me that shovel back.
[163:31.72]You were about to hit me with it.
[163:39.97]Go find your own shovel.
[163:47.99]He's digging over here.
[163:52.77]Go find your own shovel.
[164:02.80]What?
[164:04.68]Holy shit, that train went by fast!
[164:20.38]If you want my world title that bad, you should beat me in the ring for it.
[164:23.29]You gonna give me an opportunity then?
[164:28.31]You both know that will never happen, Natsune Miku.
[164:31.41]So drop it before I drop you.
[164:32.53]Yeah?
[164:32.69]Is that what you have to say?
[164:49.22]I have a match in literally five minutes.
[164:55.22]Oh no!
[165:24.41]Where did he go?
[165:25.15]I'm okay.
[165:27.51]It's actually pretty bad.
[165:38.42]Get away from me.
[165:39.68]I'm trying to go to the curtain.
[165:41.18]I blew everything.
[165:42.00]I have to alt F4.
[165:54.42]I missed my concert.
[166:09.56]This is actually very bad.
[166:12.54]How did I get hit by the train?
[166:13.80]It ran over my shin.
[166:16.49]It's alright, I'll come back to it tomorrow.
[166:20.09]I'll be fine.
[166:31.12]Thanks.
[166:39.49]That's such a cartoon sound effect.
[166:46.29]Now, am I hurt?
[167:00.20]Bird Boy.
[167:03.12]Okay.
[167:06.34]Eugene is glad that I left Wrestling Revolution.
[167:11.85]Glad that I left.
[167:14.13]Sad that I left.
[167:16.79]Disappointed that I have joined here.
[167:20.03]Glad that I left.
[167:23.18]Sad that I'm now in this one.
[167:27.42]I'm good.
[167:32.54]Okay.
[167:33.86]Singles match versus Gruesome Sharon.
[167:37.91]I'm just going for it.
[167:38.65]Two mics.
[168:17.36]Rusev and Sharon.
[168:24.80]Damn it, I missed.
[168:26.82]Not by very much.
[168:36.87]Two middle fingers.
[168:38.41]Things have been spiraling out of control here at All-American Wrestling.
[168:45.41]Well... Not tonight!
[168:52.33]I'm restoring order!
[169:00.82]Alright, let's do it.
[169:01.68]Nice reversal.
[169:11.74]Oh my God, Miku is so much better than that.
[169:14.40]Like a hundred times better.
[169:17.16]Even injured.
[169:17.62]I got hit by a train last night and I'm doing better.
[169:24.36]Let go!
[169:56.37]You okay?
[169:57.85]Can you stop?
[170:05.41]Oh my god.
[170:19.01]I keep losing focus.
[170:34.95]Again, we're still... Every move is getting reversed.
[170:58.82]Another reversal.
[171:01.43]I can't do a move.
[171:19.28]No, don't submit.
[171:22.28]There we go.
[171:34.74]I'm just handing her my head.
[171:37.04]It's because you have pre-baked the gnat RNG.
[171:43.60]That's actually true.
[172:00.10]I look like shit right now.
[172:13.17]I'm going to the top rope.
[172:20.66]Still standing.
[172:21.44]Unbelievable.
[172:21.92]Alright.
[172:24.98]Let's go.
[172:25.40]Put him up.
[172:28.52]Here we go.
[172:30.49]Shit.
[172:34.07]Those are in my head.
[172:40.91]I feel like I'm going to sneeze.
[172:45.83]Remember, I'll give you $1,000 if you can tell me what RNG is, what it's an acronym for.
[172:50.79]Random Number Generator.
[172:51.77]Thanks for the money.
[173:10.26]No!
[173:11.38]Zero health.
[173:24.61]I gotta get the ground game up better.
[173:26.91]Yeah, it's all about the ground game.
[173:29.13]I'll just get every move reversed.
[173:31.13]Every single one.
[173:40.80]I'm okay.
[173:42.04]Still in it.
[173:46.78]That's it.
[173:51.28]There's no getting out of this.
[173:54.63]Ooh, I actually kicked out.
[173:55.85]Starting to feel the crowd a little bit here.
[174:10.41]She's feeling the pressure.
[174:21.90]Too far.
[174:27.73]Shit!
[174:28.23]What's the fucking reversal?
[174:41.04]That's a big deal.
[175:09.82]We're good.
[175:14.84]Oh, we're not good.
[175:28.61]Get off.
[175:29.97]Reverse it.
[175:42.04]Oh!
[175:48.74]No!
[175:52.66]My neck!
[175:53.22]It's alright.
[176:02.38]It's alright.
[176:03.13]We weren't prepared for it.
[176:04.37]It's alright.
[176:13.27]It was just a regular match.
[176:15.03]That was a good fight.
[176:15.99]Sorry.
[176:26.64]Sorry.
[176:37.58]Take her to the subway.
[176:40.10]I can't fuck around the subway.
[176:41.48]Because I'm the one that...
[177:02.19]What a dick.
[177:13.95]What an actual dick.
[177:24.51]Whip also fucked up.
[177:31.19]Bob is literally hiding right here.
[177:33.57]He's waiting for me to go across the threshold here.
[177:42.06]Yeah, fuck you, Bob!
[178:04.69]Oh my goodness, a lot of popularity.
[178:07.25]What an asshole.
[178:21.54]Bob just killed Miku.
[178:24.02]I think I'm still fine.
[178:27.70]Hey Natsune Miku, I popped for that counter you did to a closed guard.
[178:34.97]You think you could teach me how you pulled it?
[178:36.35]What is this person talking about?
[178:45.56]Who is this?
[178:52.02]I guess I could teach you one of my moves?
[178:55.08]Sure.
[178:55.36]I don't even know who this is.
[178:58.10]Thanks for sharing your knowledge.
[178:59.84]Hope I can return the favor sometime.
[179:01.52]Okay.
[179:12.09]Okay.
[179:13.77]Uh-oh.
[179:15.10]Your buddy Phil Graves suggested that you might like to join us at Federation Online.
[179:19.26]You're not exactly a priority for us right now, but we consider bringing you in with this deal.
[179:26.26]$208,000?!
[179:32.75]That's fucking crazy!
[179:42.01]$200,000?
[179:42.03]I don't have... I don't have a salary.
[179:53.37]They're just gonna give me 200 grand?
[179:55.11]What do you mean no salary?
[179:57.86]Zero dollars a week?
[179:58.96]You gave me $200,000.
[179:59.44]How is that?
[180:00.80]Oh, um, that's fucking amazing.
[180:12.97]Zero dollars.
[180:13.79]I get $200,000 right now.
[180:15.49]$210,000.
[180:18.22]It's for a year?
[180:20.62]In what world is over $200,000 not an unbelievable income?
[180:25.38]I was going to make sure I don't take it from here and lose it on the way back to the hotel room.
[180:37.29]This is such a weird, no creative control.
[180:41.11]Wait a minute.
[180:42.17]So they might just make me stop being Miku tomorrow, which is kind of funny.
[180:50.85]And I think I want to see what they want me to do.
[180:52.97]Oh, this is $200,000.
[180:58.48]Are you kidding me?
[180:58.98]I'm taking it.
[181:03.80]I'm glad you could agree to our terms.
[181:04.92]Welcome to Federation Online.
[181:06.27]That's the most money I've ever seen in this game.
[181:08.61]Ever.
[181:10.69]I've never seen that money.
[181:21.20]What do you think of the new hairstyle our stylist suggested for you?
[181:32.24]I haven't got up from the chair yet.
[181:36.01]Uh, yeah.
[181:36.55]I think it looks great.
[181:40.00]Okay.
[181:42.12]Thanks.
[181:43.80]No creative control.
[181:45.34]But when you put the creative control into a moron's hands, who cares?
[181:48.38]Or you fell for the no creative control clause.
[181:52.16]You're as stupid as you look.
[181:53.27]Guys, honestly, look at the top right corner.
[182:05.83]Look in the top right corner.
[182:07.18]I have played this game.
[182:10.40]How many times have I streamed this game?
[182:13.16]10, 15 times maybe?
[182:13.94]With the course for a couple of years.
[182:16.00]We've never seen a number like that before.
[182:17.93]Over 225,000.
[182:18.13]Never happened.
[182:18.65]It's been like 30, 50, max.
[182:19.47]Sellout.
[182:19.79]Now quit with that money.
[182:34.23]This is so much money.
[182:35.09]Alright, so let's do it.
[182:36.11]Tag team?
[182:38.45]At 20?
[182:38.63]Why do I have a hammer?
[182:47.26]What am I losing health for?
[182:54.84]Wait, this person talks shit, right?
[183:51.80]If I can't fuck around I have a match.
[184:41.60]Yeah, I don't think you can do that for real right oh
[185:06.19]That's illegal.
[185:10.15]Okay, we're gonna go?
[185:14.61]I gotta go to my match?
[185:19.52]I... I don't know why I did that.
[185:21.62]I just... I don't know.
[185:23.14]I don't know.
[185:23.76]I just didn't know it was possible.
[185:25.74]I'm not... I didn't miss the show.
[185:28.12]I don't know what to say.
[185:32.13]That was fucked up.
[185:39.50]Wait, that's not a tombstone for the... That's not the guy that I just killed.
[185:59.10]Caught the mic.
[185:59.60]I've waited a long time for this moment and I can't wait to set about achieving my goals.
[186:08.57]If Helix thinks he's the future of Federation Online, perhaps I'll have to challenge for the Intercontinental title.
[186:13.93]Or maybe I'll form my own team and give Stunner, Stu, and Roadhog something to worry about.
[186:21.08]As a woman, it's only a matter of time before I cross paths with Comic Connie for that woman's title.
[186:28.83]But of course, my ultimate aim is to win the Universal title.
[186:34.95]You fucking piece of shit.
[187:06.70]Oh, somebody's getting their ass kicked.
[187:08.44]And now, and you gotta call, you gotta call in.
[187:10.86]Wait, is that from me or you?
[187:28.68]So far.
[187:36.01]We're good, it's fine.
[187:38.47]How did that miss?
[187:51.10]You threw the mic at me and you ruined everything, of course.
[188:06.57]Oh, that would have been insane if she went through.
[188:09.01]I'm gonna tag in now, Phil.
[188:21.40]Where's Phil?
[188:23.34]Phil, come here.
[188:25.68]Phil, put the money down and tag in.
[188:29.63]I don't know what you're doing.
[188:30.47]Alright, this guy's just doing his own thing.
[188:32.19]That's fine.
[188:34.51]Tag in!
[188:37.27]I just blasted her in the face.
[188:52.09]Bill, tag in!
[188:56.19]Tag in!
[188:59.11]You're being crazy!
[189:00.19]You're being ridiculous!
[189:01.31]Stop!
[189:03.56]Just stop and tag in.
[189:05.34]You're being ridiculous.
[189:06.68]Go behind, please.
[189:07.30]I don't want to fight somebody with full health.
[189:10.66]Give me that fucking money, by the way.
[189:12.17]It's mine.
[189:12.73]Tag in.
[189:32.98]Tag in!
[189:34.42]Thank you.
[189:34.94]Jesus.
[189:35.22]Alright.
[189:39.52]Good luck.
[189:53.87]You really just don't know what you're doing.
[190:19.35]Do something.
[190:19.95]Why are they doing this?
[190:28.22]Yeah, yeah.
[190:36.82]I'm going.
[190:37.08]I'm going.
[190:37.52]I'm going.
[190:37.78]I'm going.
[190:38.12]I'm going.
[190:38.38]What the hell is this guy?
[190:47.29]Give me that.
[191:04.31]He got sick of my shit so bad.
[191:06.71]Alright, Nirvana is not doing well.
[191:25.68]Oops, I'm sorry.
[191:33.71]I'm dazed.
[191:44.29]Yeah, I don't know whose team these two are on, but whatever.
[191:46.62]Alright, come over here.
[191:47.48]Alright, tag me in.
[191:50.40]I'm ready.
[191:50.74]Tag me in.
[191:55.34]Nice.
[192:00.98]There we go.
[192:01.26]Alright.
[192:06.58]Good, good, good, good.
[192:07.37]Nice job.
[192:16.63]That tap.
[192:26.26]This game is just so, so goofy.
[192:29.82]It's just a goofy game.
[192:32.15]It's... Did I... Was this my game of the year two years ago?
[192:35.63]I don't remember.
[192:43.53]Back in 2021, right?
[193:04.42]How did you do that?
[193:05.44]How did you do that?
[193:09.00]He killed somebody.
[193:10.16]I didn't kill anybody, actually.
[193:11.46]It didn't say anything.
[193:14.37]There was no... Oh, hey, by the way, this guy's dead.
[193:20.43]I'm just... I just... I'm somebody on... Help me.
[193:22.87]And I just can't get him off.
[193:23.69]Thank God!
[193:35.47]There's no way he isn't dead.
[193:43.88]I'm bringing the ladder in.
[193:50.66]This is illegal?
[194:08.59]If I extended the body a little, it would be fine.
[194:22.12]Dude, you tagged me in and he went over to fight the other guys over there.
[194:28.26]Pin would do it right here.
[194:29.28]This could be it.
[194:41.95]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[194:44.60]Tap.
[194:46.40]Tap.
[195:08.27]You just gotta come out here and... This is my time.
[195:13.38]My time to shine right now.
[195:14.24]I'm not even lethal.
[195:27.45]Come on.
[195:31.75]This is the time to shine is right now!
[195:35.97]You ain't getting up from that.
[195:54.62]No!
[195:54.80]Count her out!
[196:22.23]That could be the end.
[196:22.73]Perfect!
[196:28.75]Where am I?
[196:31.89]Stop - we both can't be up at the same time you moron.
[196:42.06]You've blown it so bad that I don't even know what to do now.
[196:44.22]I don't even know what to do. You blew it so bad.
[196:56.99]Shit. Alright, he's back.
[196:57.96]He's back.
[196:58.26]He's legal.
[197:01.08]I don't know why she's not getting in the ring.
[197:07.64]Alright, just need a pin and we're good.
[197:11.56]Although I don't know where I am right now.
[197:15.17]It's a great question.
[197:21.11]I have no idea where I am.
[197:34.35]I can't get in the ring.
[197:36.25]Alright, go for a pin or a submission move or anything.
[197:45.18]This is it.
[197:47.70]Alright, go with pin.
[197:52.20]Pin.
[197:53.31]Sorry, I got it.
[198:04.65]I think you're getting away.
[198:05.59]You're not getting out of here.
[198:09.17]Bell hasn't even rung yet.
[198:10.26]There's no way that you get up from that.
[198:17.26]Go for the pin.
[198:19.68]Or tag me in so I can pin.
[198:21.11]Go for pin.
[198:40.82]You're just letting her get strength.
[198:51.34]His AI brain wants to go on the top rope so bad.
[198:56.65]Look it.
[199:02.33]Come tag me in.
[199:03.81]Please.
[199:07.19]Tag me in.
[199:12.34]Thank you.
[199:12.96]Alright, let's end this.
[199:36.60]We lose this build.
[199:40.10]From Ewan's train track.
[200:12.79]Uh-oh.
[200:14.27]Oh, it's over.
[200:14.75]No way.
[200:15.65]It's over.
[200:16.13]What was it?
[200:18.50]I don't know how you're still up.
[200:26.12]Bill, I swear.
[200:44.38]Big move!
[200:50.29]How are you still doing this?
[201:02.48]Tap!
[201:03.00]It's only one minute!
[201:07.60]Just tap!
[201:23.20]Come here!
[201:28.15]Go!
[201:29.01]Ten!
[201:29.47]Two!
[201:39.60]Tap!
[201:43.64]Tap!
[201:46.48]Oh my god, give me a break!
[202:02.26]Oh, there's the tap.
[202:03.24]There it is, finally.
[202:06.14]Finally have a tap.
[202:27.08]It's just a back and forth of who can break the other person's spine first.
[202:48.67]They're using furniture to block me now.
[202:51.87]Yeah, that's going to help.
[202:57.65]He only gave me like two seconds left.
[203:01.15]Whatever.
[203:06.14]Okay.
[203:09.30]Skill?
[203:10.74]How does the skill rise?
[203:17.70]Look at all this money.
[203:21.04]By the way, that guy's not dead.
[203:24.34]Did you see anything about that guy?
[203:25.70]That guy's not dead.
[203:29.06]That guy is alive.
[203:29.81]I need to referee tonight?
[203:38.65]Yeah, sure.
[203:45.48]There's nothing left from the body.
[203:51.37]I don't know about that.
[203:54.63]Ultra Bowl versus... Ooh, these two?
[203:57.99]Alright, I'm going to call it very, very clean.
[204:15.06]Did this lady own it?
[204:45.30]Take it a little harder.
[204:45.80]What do you think?
[204:47.46]Take it a little harder.
[205:00.96]Wait, I have to call.
[205:01.94]Wait.
[205:04.38]So, if I bring a weapon in here...
[205:08.62]It's not illegal because I'm doing it, right?
[205:11.59]So therefore, I could drop this in the ring and then one of them is going to pick it up and I'll throw him out of the game.
[205:39.14]Which one of these people am I supposed to be... Am I rooting for either one of these?
[205:43.29]I just want everyone equally hurt.
[206:31.44]interfered for one second.
[206:34.40]It was one second too long.
[206:40.50]Dude, I am kicking the shit out of this guy.
[206:43.55]This guy stands absolutely no chance.
[206:48.89]What happened?
[207:01.08]Alright.
[207:02.56]Hopefully you learned your lesson.
[207:06.62]Coming right back into the ring.
[207:08.18]You stupid asshole.
[207:24.23]Oh, somebody's out of the ring.
[207:55.63]What do you think you're doing up there?
[208:17.43]Get out of here!
[208:18.59]Look at this guy regenning health.
[208:25.10]Why is there a gun in the ring?
[208:32.95]Who brought a gun in here?
[208:36.07]Dude, first person first.
[209:50.26]He was like waving at me.
[209:52.52]Why was he waving at me?
[209:57.71]Why?
[209:58.13]He's like, oh hey.
[210:01.26]I missed him twice.
[210:28.34]Where is he?
[210:31.20]He keeps going into the ring.
[210:33.45]This is not even... What is he doing?
[210:37.57]He keeps interfering over and over again.
[210:40.72]Get out of here.
[210:41.52]Stop interfering.
[210:42.56]Stay out.
[211:01.08]I don't understand what's happening.
[211:06.98]What's happening?
[211:13.54]I don't know.
[211:14.30]I feel like this is like most POV.
[211:21.79]I feel like I'm like a rodent running around.
[211:23.87]There's this motherfucker right here.
[211:36.93]Fan?
[211:38.59]Dude, a fan got in!
[211:40.33]A fan got in!
[211:44.35]Why is he holding the bell?
[211:45.65]Has anybody got a random match?
[211:56.59]Alright, okay.
[212:00.07]Alright.
[212:01.74]Back to it.
[212:04.64]Okay.
[212:06.74]Now, cut it out.
[212:07.84]I don't want to see you back up here again.
[212:09.46]If I see you back up here again, you and I are going to exchange words.
[212:19.88]He won't stop.
[212:29.51]He won't stop.
[212:37.25]This guy is a machine.
[212:40.05]He won't stop.
[212:49.84]He still hasn't gotten up there.
[213:05.22]Dammit!
[213:05.46]Oh, are you tapping?
[213:08.74]We got a winner.
[213:22.69]What are you doing?
[213:33.83]I'm still attacking him!
[213:36.64]I'm still attacking him somehow!
[213:39.56]How am I still attacking him?
[213:52.78]Fuck!
[213:58.19]That was actually fucking insane.
[214:07.20]That guy hit his head on the metal stairs.
[214:10.82]At least, like, at least 20 times.
[214:32.29]Oh my god, that's so fucking funny.
[214:37.27]He just kept falling back and smashing the crown of his head.
[214:42.95]Okay, time to go to bed.
[215:04.72]Alright, bedtime.
[215:08.06]Geez.
[215:13.50]I didn't realize that they actually lived.
[215:15.08]They got run off of full speed twice by the subway train.
[215:18.31]What was that person's name?
[215:28.60]Is this guy here?
[215:34.88]How long has he been lying there?
[215:38.35]It's been four weeks.
[215:41.07]Was found unconscious in Subway.
[215:51.63]He was supposed to ref the match that I just ref.
[215:56.73]No way.
[215:57.47]No way.
[216:04.67]That's so funny.
[216:17.84]That shaky KMPOV of that guy just fucking getting this shit beat out of him.
[216:25.94]Need to finish the job.
[216:30.38]Oh!
[216:30.88]Oh, get up, get up, get up.
[216:31.86]I'm late.
[216:39.94]Oh, that was so stupid.
[216:41.07]This is the wrong way.
[216:46.81]Uh-huh.
[216:54.29]Yep.
[217:02.03]I may be the universe champion, but we're all responsible for it.
[217:04.18]Yep.
[217:07.10]So this is the guy to beat.
[217:08.72]Ripper Ace.
[217:19.80]Forget who did that.
[217:24.43]Why am I in first person?
[217:33.40]Oh, shit.
[217:34.14]Okay, hold on.
[217:38.72]Why do I have to perform in front of the same gormless crowd every week?
[217:47.59]I would only give the fans a great show, but this is one place I can't wait to leave.
[217:50.45]Let me handle the entertainment, Natsune Miku.
[217:57.75]These fans will go home happy after they see me kick your ass.
[218:09.24]Is it Tornado Tag?
[218:09.90]Yeah, it's Tornado Tag.
[218:20.27]And what's with the where's Waldo guy in the back?
[218:23.35]Found him.
[218:23.70]Is he with us?
[218:32.59]Oh, this is illegal.
[218:33.37]Whoops.
[218:53.46]How do I already have almost half health gone?
[218:57.50]How?
[218:58.36]How is it possible?
[219:15.59]Do I have a gun in my hand?
[219:16.61]No.
[219:26.30]Stop reversing every grapple I do.
[219:28.00]It's so annoying.
[219:37.56]Okay, I think this guy's on my side.
[219:47.69]Reverse another grapple again.
[219:57.33]How do you level up skills?
[219:59.79]Appreciate it.
[220:10.26]We're going to get a submission right here.
[220:16.40]He's got a special move.
[220:19.82]Alright, pin him, pin him, pin him.
[220:20.94]I'll keep this guy busy.
[220:25.16]Go for a pin.
[220:45.80]You can't just cartwheel into somebody.
[221:09.05]That was pretty sick.
[221:09.69]Can I get the cover?
[221:17.69]Come on!
[221:19.09]Stop catching everything I do.
[221:42.55]Another reversal.
[221:44.73]I gotta get my skill up.
[221:47.70]My skill is probably low, because that's how I think I can get reversed on this character.
[221:54.06]Another reversal.
[221:54.60]Is this a skill issue?
[222:09.73]That's what I'm saying.
[222:14.98]I put Miku in this league.
[222:17.34]They all have like 80 plus skill.
[222:20.64]And I was trying to be... Don't do that.
[222:23.54]Stop.
[222:34.13]Stop him from doing this.
[222:34.91]Alright, he lost his special.
[222:38.85]That's fine.
[222:50.51]Ooh, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[222:52.15]Oh, well.
[222:58.72]Again, another... I grabbed him.
[223:00.70]That's like... Honestly, this is crazy.
[223:03.26]That's crazy.
[223:04.12]I think that eight out of ten moves I've done to this guy, he's reversed it.
[223:07.99]I'm going to get a weapon.
[223:10.01]Okay.
[223:19.98]He reversed it again.
[223:21.16]Alright, I'm done with this guy.
[223:22.42]I'm done with this guy.
[223:23.64]That's 9 out of 10 reversals.
[223:28.93]You know what?
[223:31.39]Get out of here.
[224:13.85]Finally, I did a move to him.
[224:17.63]Alright, protect me so I can do his mission on him.
[224:30.30]This is... Fuck.
[224:53.50]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[224:54.44]Get up, get up, get up.
[224:55.06]Yeah, that's good.
[224:56.46]No, that's bad.
[225:05.27]They keep reversing each other.
[225:07.19]What is with this reversal shit?
[225:10.21]I can't even move.
[225:11.25]Get out of the way!
[225:20.46]Shit.
[225:21.74]I can barely walk.
[225:23.99]Thank God for this random guy in the suit, otherwise we would have lost a long time ago.
[225:28.25]Who is it?
[225:35.88]He's just breaking this guy's leg.
[225:44.66]I don't really give a shit about that guy, so let me just rest.
[225:55.12]He's like Joga.
[225:55.94]Who cares?
[225:56.46]Alright.
[226:02.61]Legs.
[226:06.29]Cap.
[226:15.33]This guy's not even in the match and he's still fucking around.
[226:18.41]Is anybody else... Anybody else confused why this is taking so long?
[226:29.31]Why has nobody tapped?
[226:52.37]Stop!
[226:53.69]Re- That was a quadruple reversal.
[227:01.69]Dumbass.
[227:06.08]We're going the distance again on one of these fucking things.
[227:09.06]I swear to God.
[227:13.62]I swear to God.
[227:16.57]Just do somebody tap.
[227:18.63]I don't even care if it's me at this point.
[227:20.21]I seriously don't care.
[227:31.37]Only 35 seconds.
[227:33.30]He missed.
[227:39.92]Dude, this is outrageous.
[228:00.68]We went the distance again.
[228:05.22]I don't understand.
[228:16.13]I am not leaving until somebody taps out.
[228:35.38]Get over here.
[228:39.71]Reverse Andy, motherfucker.
[228:48.91]He's not done.
[228:49.39]Tap!
[228:57.71]Got it!
[229:05.46]There it is.
[229:10.69]Okay.
[229:12.67]Good.
[229:15.29]Now let's leave.
[229:18.29]It's always right after the bell, too.
[229:20.15]Every time.
[229:26.52]You're kind of funny, but you're annoying.
[229:41.54]Okay, there's agility.
[229:47.80]I have more skill than this guy and it still was a problem.
[229:52.69]I gotta do some training.
[229:53.49]I'm training skills.
[229:54.27]I can't believe I have $225,000.
[230:12.72]Alright, good night's sleep.
[230:15.61]No messing around.
[230:17.99]Sorry we didn't win that match.
[230:18.83]We'll do better next time.
[230:19.71]I mean, you did great.
[230:21.26]It was a 3v2.
[230:23.32]We still couldn't do it somehow.
[230:25.00]Don't ask me why.
[230:25.64]We should have been fine.
[230:53.90]Slow down.
[230:56.88]Oh shit, I'm going to die.
[231:01.22]I have zero HP.
[231:04.44]I need to go to the hotel.
[231:05.74]I can just eat snacks, right?
[231:14.35]Let me eat a bunch of snacks.
[231:15.23]Okay, how do you actually use this?
[231:21.43]There we go.
[231:39.51]This is my food.
[231:41.87]Get out of here.
[231:43.64]This is my food!
[231:44.50]I bought it.
[232:33.30]Alright, we're good.
[232:41.99]Alright.
[232:42.41]Do I have anything going on?
[232:43.23]I feel like I've had a match every single day.
[232:44.81]Every single week.
[232:45.39]Every single day.
[232:45.83]This has been happening in one week where I haven't had a match.
[232:56.60]I made more money than that.
[233:10.61]Trojan Force's feud with Natsune Miku appears to have lost momentum and is no longer over with the fans.
[233:18.36]They don't like it anymore.
[233:19.14]They think it's stupid.
[233:25.77]I'm at zero health.
[233:43.71]fight right now.
[233:45.37]I cannot do a match right now.
[233:46.51]How am I supposed to do this?
[233:54.10]It's the random beer you found and drank in the subway.
[234:13.88]Can I, like, do anything else?
[234:18.97]I'm scarred for life because of you.
[234:21.01]Now I won't rest until you share my pain.
[234:25.57]Wait, is this the guy that got hit by the train?
[234:36.76]What did he just do to me?
[234:39.20]You're not getting away with that.
[234:40.84]You're not getting away with that.
[234:42.91]You're not getting away with that!
[234:44.01]Get over here!
[234:50.46]Stop talking to me!
[234:51.79]I'm busy!
[234:52.69]I'm doing something!
[235:29.36]Oh, you dare walk through that door?
[236:11.58]I have an hour to eat as much food as I can.
[236:21.53]Eat, eat, eat, eat.
[236:35.17]I have to eat as much food as I can in an hour.
[236:37.61]Thank you.
[236:37.97]I appreciate it.
[236:43.86]These are beers.
[236:44.64]I don't want a beer.
[236:53.69]Move!
[236:54.03]I gotta go.
[236:58.96]No, I don't.
[236:59.36]I'm not... Oh, what's that?
[237:01.76]You want my fucking finishing move, dick?
[237:19.83]I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[237:20.73]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[237:34.30]I'm good.
[237:37.10]I'm good.
[237:38.12]Okay, at least I have maybe some health.
[237:46.03]I don't know.
[237:48.89]It's kind of not fair.
[237:49.73]I'm sick today.
[237:50.31]What kind of name is Harry Harris?
[237:55.69]Were you born with that or did you choose it?
[238:00.59]Do you think I got where I am today with a name like that?
[238:02.73]Give yourself a chance.
[238:03.62]That looked really bad.
[238:06.96]I don't suppose it matters what your name is anyways.
[238:10.66]It's going to be history.
[238:17.38]You're right, my name is going down in history as the guy that ended the career of Natsune Miku.
[238:27.19]Nice job, ref.
[238:35.97]Keep it clean.
[238:42.03]Okay.
[238:53.36]I gotta play very, very cautiously.
[238:54.88]Dump him over the edge.
[239:01.91]Good.
[239:04.61]Get this guy out of here.
[239:07.35]Test of strength.
[239:33.12]Okay, this could have gone a lot worse.
[239:39.19]Never mind.
[239:40.59]It's going pretty bad now.
[239:47.50]Don't break.
[239:53.04]I'm sick too.
[239:53.72]I'm probably taking more damage because I'm sick.
[240:05.07]Couldn't lift him.
[240:13.23]Stop grappling?
[240:14.01]Dude, when I punch, they just catch my hands and kill me.
[240:16.37]I just punched me, grabbed my arm, and mid-air, and broke my neck.
[240:28.10]I'm in a bad place here.
[240:35.24]Tag out?
[240:35.80]I don't think it's a tag.
[240:36.54]I think he just came to the ring with me.
[240:53.06]You know, it also doesn't help that both the characters I played with today are five feet tall!
[240:57.72]Sorry, relax, relax, relax.
[241:20.07]My god that dodge Yeah, this guy has to be six five he's six six oh
[241:30.15]Move the control stick in the direction of the move.
[241:32.21]Opposite direction to reverse.
[241:33.35]I think I'm doing that.
[241:36.86]Like, you fight this, right?
[241:38.34]Like I'm holding in the other direction.
[241:39.92]Because when you're doing a submission, if you hold it the other way, you'll pull it back.
[241:53.93]Bag out.
[241:55.33]I think I just lost.
[242:02.23]No, the biggest issue is when I throw a punch, it goes like here to their face.
[242:09.49]And when they throw a punch, it goes over my head and around my ears.
[242:12.03]Because they're just so much bigger than me.
[242:21.10]I don't think it's... No, I don't think it's a tag fight.
[242:30.41]There's no way I can beat this.
[242:37.00]Just get away from me for five seconds.
[242:38.44]I can't punch him!
[242:48.37]Oh my god!
[243:10.25]That's pretty cool.
[243:14.51]Alright, give me the momentum back.
[243:25.47]Don't.
[243:26.88]Not in the middle of the ring, please.
[243:38.12]Harry Harris.
[243:51.11]Just so weak too.
[243:54.37]I woke up this morning.
[243:55.35]I was sick.
[243:55.97]I still have to do the match.
[244:00.19]I have like T-Rex level reach in front of me.
[244:06.49]Did you see that?
[244:07.25]Did you see that punch?
[244:10.06]We both were in the exact same far away from each other.
[244:12.04]He punched me and I missed him.
[244:46.21]Damn it!
[244:50.73]How am I still alive?
[244:52.03]I have no idea how he hasn't put it away yet.
[244:54.55]He's hit me like three times.
[245:05.94]You've got to be fucking kidding me!
[245:08.96]That's impossible!
[245:26.30]I'm just, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go into the settings and just make her eight inches taller.
[245:30.24]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna make her like six feet tall.
[245:57.17]What have you done?
[245:57.85]Alright.
[246:06.48]I'm angry now.
[246:09.24]Now I'm angry.
[246:11.56]He got instantly reversed again.
[246:14.43]I don't even have time to press any button.
[246:16.69]I just walk.
[246:21.72]God, I... Fuck off!
[246:25.28]He's got like an entire Subway sandwich length of reach on me.
[246:31.05]Do you understand?
[246:32.19]He's got two meatball subs attached to the end of his hands.
[246:35.28]It's not fair!
[246:50.89]What the fuck is he doing?
[246:57.72]He reversed it.
[246:59.46]Tell you run that tape back and you tell me what happened there.
[247:06.00]I just hear my head being crushed.
[247:19.30]Watch, I'm going to grab him.
[247:24.91]I'm surprised I didn't reverse that too.
[247:26.27]You know what?
[247:26.73]No, I'm not done.
[247:28.67]I'm not done with you.
[247:48.67]Alright, just get out.
[247:59.32]Get up.
[248:00.60]Somebody help me up.
[248:04.86]Oh, okay.
[248:06.12]I love how I suffered for that.
[248:12.17]Harry Harris is now a face and he has the support of a fan.
[248:18.34]I'm gonna beat the shit out of this guy backstage.
[248:20.02]I need to do a training arc.
[248:21.54]I really do need to train skill or something.
[248:46.84]Alright.
[248:48.08]Back to it.
[248:57.81]I need to... No more fucking around.
[249:00.17]I need full health for the next fight.
[249:03.57]I need 100% health.
[249:09.84]I swear if I wake up with diarrhea or something, I'll be so pissed.
[249:14.26]No, no, no, stop.
[249:15.12]I want to... Okay.
[249:18.07]Go to the doctor?
[249:26.72]Somebody is just getting... Just piled on right now.
[249:29.94]Alright, I'm going to the hospital.
[249:59.58]Is he alright?
[250:22.94]Wanna do an interview?
[250:42.28]This is bad.
[250:43.46]How have they not found his dead body yet?
[250:47.69]It's gonna have to wait until he's supposed to ref.
[250:50.73]Before they actually know.
[250:54.89]Go to the hospital.
[250:55.55]I know, I know, I know.
[250:56.85]Where is it?
[250:57.63]It's like in a weird spot.
[250:59.63]It's next to the... Okay, it's like next to the gym.
[251:04.70]Down here, right?
[251:07.30]Okay.
[251:14.86]Okay, heal me.
[251:15.56]Go confess at the church.
[251:23.35]Okay.
[251:23.57]Okay.
[251:23.87]John Crockett?
[251:24.19]No.
[251:40.63]Federico Fischer was found dead in the street this morning.
[251:43.27]Police are appealing for any information about the 36-year-old's death.
[251:56.64]You literally killed him.
[252:01.36]The industry will come together this week to stage a special tribute in memory of Federico Fischer.
[252:07.25]Prior to the public show, a private funeral will take place at 7pm.
[252:11.25]I'm gonna find a spot for you on the card.
[252:29.72]I suggest you take this opportunity to improve yourself and become more valuable to the company.
[252:39.78]Okay.
[252:41.48]Um.
[252:45.25]We can't always blame Rip Race for the ratings.
[252:47.07]We all have to make the show worth watching.
[252:55.56]Oh, no, no.
[252:55.76]Oh, wait.
[252:55.98]This is from the hospital to the cemetery.
[252:58.12]Okay.
[253:23.51]I'm here to challenge you to a match on the fourth week of August.
[253:32.83]Um.
[253:33.75]Should I do it?
[253:38.44]Nah.
[253:39.34]Get out of my face.
[253:51.93]When's the funeral?
[254:01.81]I just realized what I'm doing right now.
[254:04.15]This is the equivalent of, like, I am showing up here.
[254:10.59]Like, oh, my arm's fucking fucked up, too.
[254:12.41]Yeah, it's like when you're in trouble with mom and dad.
[254:15.63]It's like, but no, I'm hurt, too.
[254:21.17]That's my seat.
[254:22.17]Get up.
[254:22.49]What do you mean this is your seat?
[254:23.81]This is a wheelchair.
[254:24.73]No, get out of here.
[254:30.75]No, I didn't want to give it.
[254:31.87]No, that's mine.
[254:32.57]Did I say yes?
[254:43.58]It's like, wait a minute.
[254:45.32]Natsune, didn't you kill this guy?
[254:48.84]Yeah, but I mean, like, yeah, we got in a big fight and like, he broke my, look at me.
[255:04.09]When is this funeral?
[255:15.75]Put the head... Put the tombstone down.
[255:19.37]You're not... Come on.
[255:24.03]Oh my god!
[255:25.39]Oh my god!
[255:26.49]Oh my god!
[255:27.18]I've ruined the funeral!
[255:28.52]Oh my god!
[255:29.12]I have to get out of here!
[255:30.38]Oh my god!
[255:31.32]Oh my god!
[255:40.76]What happened to me?
[255:43.92]What happened to me?
[255:44.82]Is everything okay?
[255:52.80]It's not still broken, right?
[255:55.64]Oh, yikes.
[256:03.09]To be fair, let's be very realistic and be very fair.
[256:08.12]He tripped over my wheelchair and smashed his head into it, okay?
[256:14.73]He was all up in my face and tripped and hit his- and smashed it.
[256:20.87]So that was not even my fault.
[256:28.01]When is the funeral?
[256:31.39]Eating and drinking is good for an energy boost, but you'll make yourself sick.
[256:38.31]When's the funeral?
[256:41.01]It's 7am tomorrow.
[256:42.71]I missed it?
[256:51.97]It's tomorrow.
[256:52.89]You kind of ruined it, dude.
[256:53.93]It's tomorrow.
[256:54.77]Oh, okay.
[257:17.13]I'll be back tomorrow.
[257:25.67]Did I just spend $2,200 on the wheelchair?
[257:27.69]Is that what that is telling me?
[257:28.84]For props?
[257:29.72]Okay.
[257:43.33]Listen, Natsune Miku, we're going to market a weight, and we'd like you to promote it.
[257:51.01]If you could just mention the product during your next show, it could be worth $2,100.
[257:53.93]Oh, yeah.
[257:54.59]Sure.
[257:54.87]I'll give you a weight to take to the ring.
[258:05.19]It'll be worth every penny to see you with it.
[258:06.72]Okay?
[258:07.76]Okay.
[258:12.65]This is against Harry Harris.
[258:14.05]Did I miss the funeral?
[258:16.27]Oh, I ruined the funeral.
[258:17.49]Okay.
[258:18.43]Should I roam?
[258:19.77]No, no roaming.
[258:20.21]No.
[258:42.67]Look what I got.
[258:47.05]What do you think about this?
[258:49.73]This is a standard 20 kilogram, 45 pound weight.
[258:59.26]Take a look.
[259:01.54]You all should be buying this.
[259:06.34]Alright, these two were a huge problem last time.
[259:11.65]I just realized the music is very loud, but whatever.
[259:19.55]Is the game loud or are we good?
[259:21.75]Is the game being really loud?
[259:23.11]Are we good?
[259:23.59]How's the audio?
[259:24.01]Are we alright?
[259:29.47]Has the audio been too hard?
[259:31.58]This weight changed my life.
[259:32.72]I don't know where I'd be without it.
[259:36.78]And you don't have to be a Federation Online star like me to own a weight like this.
[259:44.52]For just a few dollars, you can pick one up of your own.
[259:46.44]I suggest you do so before stocks run out.
[259:52.32]You're obviously sold out.
[259:54.38]But so has this arena, and they paid to see me kick your ass.
[260:03.67]Come on!
[260:26.31]I tried.
[260:31.87]I don't care if it's illegal!
[260:52.61]Why can I swing?
[260:55.20]What?
[260:59.30]Why can't I swing the... What's going on?
[261:27.99]I got disqualified.
[261:29.19]Yeah, that's fine.
[261:29.85]I can still win.
[261:48.30]He just hit himself in the mouth.
[262:17.13]Term of violence isn't the answer.
[262:18.35]I mean.
[262:22.73]What do you want to say?
[262:23.61]I got disqualified for doing my product placement.
[262:25.82]I don't know what happened there.
[262:30.06]I climbed it and fell off.
[262:34.20]I need someone to get knocked outside so I can use my product.
[263:04.37]Oh, that's my friend.
[263:05.13]Oh, this is wrong people.
[263:06.21]Wrong people.
[263:06.63]I'm sorry.
[263:07.23]That's my bad.
[263:07.69]Where's my weight?
[263:31.11]We're on the ground.
[263:35.90]I don't even know.
[263:37.44]Wait, the wait's right here somewhere.
[263:38.68]There it is.
[263:39.86]Alright.
[263:40.46]Now it's a bad... Now it's a bad time for you.
[263:58.00]Do first person.
[264:17.49]Is he alright?
[264:30.48]What are you looking at?
[264:48.01]Is that my guy?
[264:48.61]Yep.
[264:48.79]Tap!
[264:50.66]What happened to his arm?
[265:02.29]Oh, no, no, no.
[265:02.77]I was like, what the hell did I do?
[265:23.87]That's one, two, three.
[265:26.89]Yes!
[265:33.35]Harry Harris injured his back in that match and will be out for, oh.
[265:37.81]Look at the glass.
[265:42.19]Strategic disqualification.
[265:43.93]That's kind of what happened.
[265:57.13]Matsunomiku is upset that she was barely involved in that match.
[266:12.70]We're still number one.
[266:16.30]Give Miku more screen time.
[266:22.21]Listen, Miku, after what happened, I realized that none of this is worth dying for.
[266:29.92]Why don't we put all this behind us before somebody seriously gets hurt?
[266:50.65]The world would be a better place without you in it.
[267:17.45]It's alright.
[267:23.60]I won a shot at the title.
[267:26.22]Listen, Miku.
[267:27.38]I've been keeping an eye on your progress, and I think some changes need to be made.
[267:29.96]You know that you've only won 43% of your matches so far this year?
[267:39.63]Actually, really good.
[267:40.43]Get your win rate up to 48%, or I'll give your spot to someone else.
[267:49.11]Just completely ignoring the, like sometimes over one to 200 pound difference.
[267:57.01]The two foot long Subway sandwiches for arms.
[268:00.83]And what are you talking about?
[268:03.24]43% is fucking unbelievable.
[268:05.44]Being in like five to 10 weight classes lower than what I should be.
[268:08.50]Alright.
[268:11.02]This is a 10 man team.
[268:13.82]Wait, 10 V 10.
[268:16.30]What does that mean?
[268:19.69]10-man team.
[268:21.91]This is going to be a nightmare.
[268:24.25]Just break something.
[268:33.44]Alright, thank you, FreeTime.
[268:34.54]See you later.
[268:35.54]Remember, you're on a mission to increase your win rate.
[268:39.94]I'll get it right now.
[268:44.65]I'll get it right now.
[269:07.47]Alright, where do I want to go in the little bit of time I have?
[269:10.61]I could go to the toilet.
[269:13.55]I could go to the gym.
[269:14.79]Let me go to the gym.
[269:21.57]This is 10 man.
[269:25.02]Should I train?
[269:28.24]Do I need strength or should I just do maybe agility?
[269:34.30]This is agility, right?
[269:39.35]Yeah, 75.
[269:39.83]Give me one more.
[269:47.32]76.
[269:47.34]Here we go.
[269:48.72]Alright, alright.
[269:49.22]Enough.
[269:51.08]Now I'm gonna eat some food.
[269:51.84]Okay, now... Let's get out of here.
[270:05.57]Get some food.
[270:13.10]Is it just water?
[270:13.62]I remember the funeral.
[270:18.74]Dude, that guy's been dead for three weeks.
[270:23.15]The funeral was like three weeks ago.
[270:28.33]I did not just do that, did I?
[270:33.57]What did I do to that guy?
[270:34.47]That guy is really hurt and I didn't do anything.
[270:45.50]I didn't do anything.
[270:48.68]You've got to be kidding me.
[270:49.76]Right when I was preparing for this shit.
[270:54.09]Do I have his head?
[270:59.93]Thank you.
[271:01.07]Now let me just eat something for a second.
[271:23.55]Okay, that's fine.
[271:24.49]That's cool.
[271:25.33]Thanks for the hug, but I've got to go.
[271:27.05]Is that good enough?
[271:33.34]That's good enough.
[271:33.78]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[271:34.64]Get out.
[271:41.88]Alright.
[271:48.87]I don't want to be in first person for this.
[271:50.37]No way.
[271:57.70]How are we going to do... Somebody has to get pinned for this?
[272:07.17]This is impossible.
[272:12.54]This is not possible to...
[272:20.23]Who is who?
[272:20.97]I don't know.
[272:21.69]I think it's just every single person versus themselves or... It's a... How many people are in here?
[272:27.96]Is this 10?
[272:28.86]20 people?
[272:29.22]Dude, what?
[272:29.48]It's 10.
[272:29.74]Man, there are more than 10 people here though.
[272:49.99]I'm just going to hang out up here.
[272:54.21]We can actually do first person for this.
[273:09.68]Okay.
[273:10.62]What is going on?
[273:19.07]My reach sucks!
[273:30.17]Have you guys ever heard of the movie Hardcore Henry?
[273:34.89]This is Hardcore Henry.
[273:36.27]This is the movie.
[273:39.05]This is the only thing you see in the whole movie.
[274:08.69]This is VR.
[274:09.79]It just is.
[274:10.39]I don't know where I am.
[274:22.78]I... Alright, I'm just gonna watch.
[274:28.54]Fuck this.
[274:30.66]We're watching from here.
[274:49.00]That's me getting counted out.
[275:07.65]This is blood.
[275:10.35]Whose blood is this?
[275:24.28]This is just a dream fight.
[275:40.45]Somebody said, dude, can you please stop playing the game with a steering wheel?
[275:46.31]That was fucking fantastic.
[275:49.47]What a great comment.
[276:00.40]Everybody in this ring is gonna get hurt.
[276:04.64]There's no winner.
[276:05.38]There will be no victor.
[276:07.45]It's only going to be pain for everyone.
[276:10.15]Everyone's gonna get hurt.
[276:14.51]I can't wait to see the end.
[276:16.01]I'm telling you right now, I ain't leaving until at least seven people are fucking in the hospital.
[276:20.18]I'm not leaving until that happens.
[276:26.32]You broke the ladder, you idiots.
[276:34.71]I can't put the ladder back together again.
[276:36.27]We're gonna... Alright.
[276:43.36]Place your bets.
[276:43.90]How many injuries do we see?
[276:46.32]Before the match actually ends.
[276:47.78]How many at the end of the match cards are we gonna see?
[276:51.42]I'm gonna say three.
[276:57.74]Do I even care if I get disqualified, by the way?
[277:00.73]Do I actually care?
[277:06.48]I mean, do I care about this?
[277:10.74]My win rate.
[277:11.34]That's right.
[277:11.82]You're right.
[277:12.12]Alright.
[277:13.99]I'm just going to litter things all over the ring so everyone can hit their head on it and stuff.
[277:18.31]There's only five minutes remaining.
[277:56.33]A random pin could actually just win it.
[278:00.54]Like this.
[278:08.62]DON'T!
[278:09.88]OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY WON!
[278:16.07]You Ja- Jaz won't always be the protect- What happened?
[278:22.91]Was- Why does it say his team won?
[278:32.96]Was huge ass even here?
[278:34.60]Oh, he was.
[278:38.42]Somebody interfered.
[278:47.61]Ain't no one getting by.
[278:51.67]You gotta pay me 50 bucks to get by.
[278:59.94]You fucking idiot.
[279:20.82]You can climb that?
[279:33.36]I didn't know you could climb this.
[279:44.11]Oh, whatever.
[279:45.01]Wasn't enough time for anybody to get injured.
[279:50.58]Nirvana required stitches after recurring some facial damage in that match and will be nursing the wound until next week.
[279:56.00]Okay.
[279:58.42]That was... I remember that, actually.
[280:00.73]That was the first-person chair.
[280:05.47]There's one injury.
[280:08.49]Okay.
[280:15.69]Stunner Stew's profile suffered.
[280:20.15]I didn't, I'm fine.
[280:22.68]Disappointed.
[280:23.26]No, just one.
[280:26.72]It's alright.
[280:30.08]We're still in second.
[280:30.72]This game is insane.
[280:37.57]I still, I feel like I... I feel like half the stuff I saw today is already in the long-term memory.
[280:46.47]Which is crazy, because it happened four hours ago.
[280:52.51]Alright, let me heal.
[281:04.99]Would you be willing to sell that water bottle for six dollars?
[281:09.48]The one that I just threw on the ground?
[281:11.32]Yeah.
[281:13.64]And it's smashed into a million pieces?
[281:17.18]This water bottle will be worth every penny.
[281:18.90]I hope it is.
[281:20.00]Yeah, congratulations.
[281:20.88]There it is.
[281:21.20]It's on the ground.
[281:53.01]I don't know.
[281:53.55]I'm just trying to cause mayhem.
[281:54.55]Alright, stop causing mayhem.
[281:56.89]Get out.
[282:04.34]I want that tombstone.
[282:05.30]Whatever.
[282:15.51]What's the android doing?
[282:38.58]Okay.
[282:41.56]Okay, Harry Harris has recovered from his injury.
[282:43.56]Okay.
[282:50.40]So, I was not on the winning team, was I?
[282:52.34]Okay, singles versus Joanna Fight.
[282:57.54]Alright.
[282:57.76]18. 18.
[283:13.08]Get off of me, Phil!
[283:23.51]Did I puke?
[283:26.13]I puked the bed and rolled out of bed?
[283:27.77]That was actually uncalled for.
[283:39.21]And now I'm already hurt for this match.
[283:41.33]I didn't do anything.
[283:47.06]You know what?
[283:47.44]Fuck you, Phil.
[283:49.16]You just ruined everything.
[283:50.82]You blew it big time.
[283:52.06]Yeah, I'm gonna be fucking... He came in and saw... Yeah, I was like in bed and he just attacked me in bed and I shit and pissed the bed.
[284:16.30]Now I'm hurt.
[284:19.08]I have to get my win rate up.
[284:30.79]Please get away from me.
[284:36.39]He's blocking.
[284:37.31]No, I'm done with you, Phil.
[284:41.27]Forget it.
[284:46.26]Oh, it seems to be an altercation backstage between Phil Graves and Natsunomiku.
[284:51.20]Apparently, this morning, Natsunomiku pissed shit and puked the bed.
[284:55.94]And Phil did not like that very much.
[284:59.30]Causing a little bit of a Ster.
[285:04.45]Weird, because they're tag team partners.
[285:35.42]He can't be dead.
[285:37.34]Oh, who's this?
[285:38.26]Shit
[286:04.61]I missed my match.
[286:05.43]I'm going to bed.
[286:21.12]You cannot fault me for that.
[286:22.84]I was attacked because I don't know for no reason.
[286:27.60]There was no reason.
[286:33.77]Bill Graves was found unconscious in the hotel and will be resting up in the hospital for the next four weeks.
[286:39.77]Okay.
[286:41.71]Come on!
[286:42.13]I have to win this match.
[287:07.80]I have to win this match or it's over.
[287:15.64]So we need food.
[287:17.12]I need to eat something.
[287:20.56]I got a little bit of time.
[287:23.47]I need food.
[287:24.59]I'm not going to start anything with anybody.
[287:27.31]I have to win this match.
[287:39.52]No beer, just water and apples.
[287:41.34]That's all I want.
[287:45.36]He's not talking to me.
[287:49.36]Thank you.
[287:49.88]Yes.
[287:50.86]Looks a little low.
[287:51.52]Find something to eat or drink.
[287:53.22]Alright.
[287:54.36]That's enough.
[288:05.51]There's no time for a nap, by the way.
[288:16.46]What?
[288:27.33]What?
[288:36.08]Why did that happen?
[288:43.20]Was it because I was spamming it?
[288:52.69]I heard you pissed yourself.
[288:54.58]Why don't you do it in the... You know what?
[288:56.24]You know what, Phil?
[288:57.60]You know what, Phil?
[288:58.55]Fuck off.
[288:59.61]You're going into the fire.
[289:19.30]You're more popular than me, Miku.
[289:20.60]I'm so sorry.
[289:21.26]I didn't mean to tell you.
[289:22.14]Oh, wow.
[289:22.58]You peed your pants.
[289:24.32]You can't take it back.
[289:25.26]You can't take it back, Phil.
[289:27.71]There's no taking it back now.
[289:50.01]So put away wait wait can somebody explain to me what happened I
[290:23.35]Why did the vending machine do that?
[290:35.84]Hold on a minute.
[290:37.08]Are they going to hold a memorial for Miku?
[290:43.02]That's the longest career ever.
[290:52.26]Are they going to hold the memorial?
[290:56.91]Where was that?
[290:57.67]Federation, right?
[291:02.25]Oh, no.
[291:03.11]Okay.
[291:04.69]Oh, there's Evan Gillette.
[291:05.97]Oh, yeah.
[291:06.49]That guy died of natural causes.
[291:08.29]Okay.
[291:26.99]Nice job, Gil.
[291:32.40]Gil with the championship here.
[291:33.58]He used it too much while it was damaged.
[291:37.30]When was it?
[291:38.16]How was it damaged?
[291:38.98]I'm playing as Waltie.
[292:20.31]Alright, I've had enough.
[292:21.47]I know how to play.
[292:29.46]Why do you laugh like that?
[292:30.46]You mean like this?
[292:31.96]I don't know.
[292:42.78]An orange for free.
[292:47.57]I fucking keep forgetting that you eat while you're full.
[292:50.86]I'm so, whatever.
[292:51.90]I'm so stupid.
[292:58.01]He's a Sesame Street character.
[293:02.01]So, wait a minute.
[293:20.91]Why is he stuck here?
[293:29.47]It's not happening.
[293:35.44]You're welcome.
[293:51.19]How did I do that before?
[293:53.47]I've seen it happen another stream.
[293:58.99]I'm pretty sure it's an intended mechanic.
[294:02.37]But wouldn't... Isn't it already broken?
[294:03.95]I'm just... I want to see how it works.
[294:13.39]Okay, so that... It just exploded.
[294:17.06]It must just be random.
[294:18.50]Like, while you're using it, if you use it too much.
[294:25.21]I just dropped a bunch of like feed on the ground.
[294:27.27]Alright, somebody said we want power.
[294:40.53]I'll give you power.
[294:43.35]Stop playing old shitty wrestlers.
[294:53.19]We want power.
[294:56.06]Okay.
[294:58.72]I'll give it to you.
[295:16.27]I'll give it to you.
[295:34.08]I love him already.
[295:34.86]Did you shit your pants?
[295:41.34]I think this guy shit his pants.
[295:47.86]Look out, everybody.
[295:48.44]It's Walti, the master of the Death Valley Driver.
[295:53.70]You seriously think that a pathetic move like that will work against a warrior like me?
[295:57.00]You should be worried because when I hit the Death Valley Driver, this match is over.
[296:05.92]You're in deep shit.
[296:07.82]The match will be over when I hit you with my tombstone.
[296:09.90]Your entire career will be over.
[296:14.48]We'll see about that.
[297:06.70]Eat that.
[297:08.00]This is a pretty good match so far.
[297:18.21]Test of strength.
[297:18.95]Good reversal.
[297:35.33]How's that?
[297:37.46]That sting?
[298:06.37]It's a good first match.
[298:07.13]It should be a victory here.
[298:11.34]Oh, fuck off.
[298:25.50]What's this?
[298:25.84]I don't know what the wealthy special move is.
[298:28.75]We'll find out.
[298:32.35]Maybe not.
[298:35.01]Okay, whatever.
[298:36.73]Alright, one special move.
[298:37.69]Let's hit it.
[298:40.99]Build the momentum.
[298:41.75]If you taunt, by the way, you build momentum.
[298:43.71]You ready?
[298:49.17]Death Valley Driver.
[298:51.41]They literally said it in the beginning.
[298:54.54]One.
[298:55.76]Two.
[298:57.26]Three.
[299:00.38]This is so rude.
[299:04.88]Alright.
[299:34.08]This sucks.
[299:34.54]Where's Miku?
[299:35.38]Miku, um... I'm okay.
[299:59.84]You didn't even get hit by that.
[300:00.90]Wait, what?
[300:07.15]She just blocked it for you.
[300:08.21]Wait, were you proposing that you help me?
[300:09.89]Oh, whatever.
[300:28.65]You totally dripped down?
[300:29.77]I think it looks pretty good.
[300:37.65]Stop doing old shitty wrestlers.
[300:42.59]Yeah, they're always like a squirrely guy.
[300:44.39]I don't think I've ever done anything normal.
[300:49.13]It's always a squirrely weirdo or a huge, like seven, eight foot tall, 700 pounds.
[300:56.11]There's never been a normal person.
[300:57.93]Okay.
[301:10.00]Uh oh.
[301:21.53]Singles match.
[301:30.03]I can't.
[301:31.03]I can't.
[301:40.20]I just can't see where I'm going.
[302:01.63]I can't see where I'm going.
[302:03.29]You prescribed me some steroids?
[302:16.68]Okay.
[302:17.98]Thanks for the steroids.
[302:26.05]Look at all this food that's still here.
[302:34.19]Go work out.
[302:34.71]It's true.
[302:48.65]Are you saying that because I'm old?
[302:54.31]Oh, nice.
[302:56.61]Us old guys, we stayed again.
[302:57.85]Uh, I need a dumbbell.
[303:08.30]Here we go.
[303:08.62]76%?
[303:11.06]I'm on steroids.
[303:30.39]Did he eat all that food on the ground?
[303:43.45]Like an hour?
[303:43.91]I'll be alright.
[304:16.72]Sell that burger for $5.
[304:17.42]Thanks for the money.
[304:26.63]Alright, we're good.
[304:30.73]It's time to fight.
[304:42.86]Why'd you give him a half-eaten burger?
[304:44.42]I gave him nothing.
[304:58.50]Can we get an update on your weird pee?
[305:01.84]Oh, you mean when I pissed on a water test strip and it said there was a shitload of iron in it?
[305:06.62]I didn't really follow up with it.
[305:11.43]How did that miss?
[305:12.35]You gotta be kidding me.
[305:13.85]That was perfect.
[305:22.49]I think you're a great wrestler, Greg McMahon, but you're not even a wrestler at all.
[305:30.04]You're a glorified stuntman who can only win matches by swinging weapons and smashing through furniture.
[305:37.92]When I step into this ring, it becomes a war zone.
[305:40.19]I guess that's too much for you to handle.
[305:46.26]Match is too much for you to handle because you're not civilized enough to play by my rules.
[306:08.31]It was a weird exchange, but whatever.
[306:15.97]He's kind of kicking my ass.
[306:22.36]Damn it.
[306:25.02]That move just did 10 to 15% damage.
[306:29.46]Stupid.
[306:40.65]How are you doing all this?
[306:52.27]Oh shit it's gonna be over really quickly.
[307:08.07]I'm way out of my league here.
[307:24.68]Get off.
[307:32.16]I'm way out of my league.
[307:36.34]I'm so out of my league.
[307:40.10]I can't even get up.
[307:49.97]Got my head.
[307:59.45]It demolished me.
[308:00.81]That was not even a contest.
[308:04.24]I got so badly beat.
[308:05.66]That was unbelievable.
[308:41.85]Bring him to the subway.
[308:44.96]I don't think we're gonna be able to see him on the subway.
[308:52.59]Forget about the subway, I need some ointment.
[308:55.49]I think I have a few cuts.
[309:08.46]No new pinned tweet.
[309:09.56]Liar.
[309:27.85]Look!
[309:30.49]76 strength, 89 skill, 86 agility.
[309:33.77]What is he doing here?
[309:35.33]Why is he in Wrestling Revolution?
[309:40.13]This guy is way, way too good to be in this league.
[309:48.80]That was ridiculous.
[309:55.99]Oh yeah, some of the people are asking, what the hell are you talking about?
[309:57.81]So I peed on a water test strip, and it said I had a bunch of lead in my piss.
[310:05.65]And I just never followed up with it.
[310:12.06]But I'm glad Greg McMahon could teach you a lesson.
[310:15.98]You don't belong at Wrestling Revolution, Waltie.
[310:17.84]Alright.
[310:27.09]A lot of people ask me what the hell I mean.
[310:29.33]Alright, so I got water test strips to test the water to see what's in it.
[310:33.89]Like, okay, just to see how it's doing.
[310:36.60]And I was like, you know what?
[310:38.80]Just for no reason.
[310:39.67]I just thought it was kind of funny.
[310:41.59]Just for no reason.
[310:43.41]It wasn't like, oh, I'm going to do this.
[310:44.83]I pissed on one just to see what my piss looked like.
[310:48.46]What my pH and everything was.
[310:55.95]Because it's designed for water.
[310:57.53]It's not designed for anything else.
[310:59.03]I was like, that's kind of funny.
[311:01.59]And the only reason why I'm saying that is because they put a hundred of these strips into one container.
[311:11.20]And guess what?
[311:11.62]You only need to use it once.
[311:15.18]So it's like, oh, look, water test strips.
[311:16.74]You know, bye.
[311:17.42]Here's some water test strips.
[311:19.92]When am I ever going to need more than three of these?
[311:23.82]That's enough water test strips for 40, 50 years.
[311:25.86]I was like, you know, whatever.
[311:27.54]I'm just going to pee on one.
[311:30.86]You explained that really badly.
[311:35.16]I mean, they're not designed for pee.
[311:44.08]Gil feels great today and is in perfect health.
[311:54.27]Why would you pee on one?
[311:55.31]I don't know.
[311:58.47]In my mind, I was like, why not?
[312:10.78]No, I didn't pee on all of them.
[312:19.13]You guys are making it sound like I took one out, tested my water, and then just laid them all on the ground and pissed all over them.
[312:26.73]No.
[312:28.65]I peed on one.
[312:29.67]I didn't pee on all of them.
[312:31.49]That would be so wasteful and stupid.
[312:33.39]Alright.
[312:38.05]So now let's go.
[312:39.05]It would have been way funnier if you did.
[312:48.46]I wasn't even trying to be funny.
[312:49.48]There was nobody I was making this joke for.
[312:51.12]I just felt like doing it.
[312:53.94]Because I just feel like doing this.
[312:56.55]And it's just completely, just something completely benign.
[312:58.53]It's not, it's just like, you're just doing it because you feel like it.
[313:12.75]It's impulsive.
[313:14.62]It's really not... Okay.
[313:16.80]It is impulsive, but it's not... Oh my god, what impulsive behavior.
[313:20.84]That's wrong what you did.
[313:22.72]I peed on a fucking test strip.
[313:27.34]I peed on a water test strip.
[313:28.83]Who cares?
[313:29.21]This is... This is not doing anything negative.
[313:37.17]There's nothing wrong.
[313:50.44]Why is there lead in your pee?
[313:52.14]There isn't!
[313:52.72]It's not designed for pee, so it's gonna come up wrong.
[314:12.55]What are you?
[314:15.46]Somebody always does this shit, I swear to God.
[314:19.76]I'm sorry.
[314:26.80]Stop fighting me, Leon.
[314:28.31]We're not... You and I are friends.
[314:29.97]Get away.
[314:38.90]Get away from me.
[314:40.16]Where's my guitar?
[314:40.86]There it is.
[314:54.28]That's what we're gonna do.
[314:54.90]We're gonna rock out when we get around a carton.
[314:56.86]That's what's gonna happen.
[315:04.37]Hmph.
[315:38.44]This guy's glow in the dark.
[315:40.64]Why is this guy glow in the dark?
[316:13.55]Waltie, I'm sure you think you'll win this match, and I certainly know that I can.
[316:16.17]Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and bet it on it?
[316:22.65]$2,190 says I kick your ass.
[316:24.23]Okay.
[316:48.84]That was a lot of damage.
[316:51.68]Just do that over and over again.
[316:53.28]This is free money.
[317:02.64]You can't... Okay, you can't hold it.
[317:06.09]You can't hold it forever.
[317:06.79]I thought you could.
[317:11.13]How strong is this guy?
[317:21.01]I actually really want that money.
[317:25.85]Come on.
[317:33.40]Waltie sucks.
[317:34.82]Get rid of kill Waltie.
[317:38.08]Really?
[317:38.40]Because Waltie is the only one that's been able to do wrestling moves in the last like probably three and a half hours.
[318:00.07]How is this not a rope break?
[318:01.03]What do you mean?
[318:07.05]Quality is based.
[318:10.80]That's what I'm saying.
[318:17.88]Good reversal.
[318:27.05]I got my special Death Valley driver.
[318:29.89]I just pretended to be excited.
[318:30.79]I'm sorry.
[318:32.19]That was like me pretending to be excited.
[318:41.96]That's made almost $2,200. $2,200.
[319:01.23]Resident Sleeper, waltzy gaming.
[319:06.07]That was two clean wins in a row.
[319:16.20]This song sucks.
[319:18.91]It's so annoying.
[319:21.63]It's just one rip.
[319:31.40]Uh-huh, okay.
[319:43.62]Walthy's not bad.
[319:44.50]Why does everybody hate Walthy so much?
[319:56.22]But the wind just makes you another target, Waltie.
[319:57.82]Don't fucking threaten me.
[320:25.88]There's a lot of people here.
[320:32.98]I was playing with fire there.
[321:00.61]Why do I feel like if I just sit right here?
[321:19.83]You can see through the glasses.
[321:26.69]What's a good one to do here?
[321:27.85]Probably, yeah.
[321:50.64]They're really... They're really dumb.
[321:52.70]They're just... I'm just gonna stand on the other side.
[321:54.20]That's it.
[321:58.49]I almost just died.
[322:01.61]I'm just gonna stand on the other side.
[322:02.67]Do third person.
[322:03.49]Just watch.
[322:18.90]Jesus.
[322:20.78]Third person.
[322:35.35]He's taunting me.
[322:45.96]I'm just, like, come and get me.
[322:47.76]I'm just annoying.
[322:51.24]That was scary.
[322:59.87]Jesus.
[323:00.43]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[323:21.62]Stop.
[323:23.72]I thought the train was going to a stop.
[323:25.90]I'm actually okay.
[323:27.76]Alright.
[323:29.32]Okay, the train- I thought the train was stopping and I could get across.
[323:33.67]I think I'm dead.
[323:34.33]I think I'm dead.
[323:40.81]What the fuck?
[323:43.23]He's 326 pounds?
[323:45.95]I'm alright.
[323:46.61]I'm okay.
[323:47.79]I just was unconscious.
[323:58.03]No.
[323:59.19]I need to see this through.
[324:15.50]This guy's one of the reasons why I feel like shit right now.
[324:24.60]I need to take a pay cut?
[324:26.92]I don't want to take a pay cut.
[324:29.16]No, fuck all of you.
[324:30.36]What's ever a pay cut?
[324:48.70]No shit, I want this.
[324:55.46]I need to get back up.
[324:56.32]I need to get back up.
[324:59.45]Stop telling me to eat food and leave me alone!
[325:28.79]Damn favorite item.
[325:55.38]Oh my god, look at how fast I am!
[326:04.68]What do you guys have to say?
[326:24.11]I'm so fast.
[326:35.97]You'll never catch me!
[326:36.81]Do you go faster in the chair?
[327:01.33]You actually don't go faster.
[327:09.28]I feel like I could move faster though, couldn't I?
[327:11.14]I promise I'm not trying to hit anybody.
[327:25.63]Bring Miku back.
[327:27.67]Miku's not coming back, I'm sorry.
[327:42.45]Alright, we're good.
[327:55.84]I'm obsessed with the subway right now.
[328:34.80]Alright, I gotta stop doing this.
[328:36.48]I gotta stop doing this.
[328:37.62]I gotta stop doing this.
[328:39.08]I gotta stop doing this.
[328:40.46]I gotta stop doing this.
[328:41.62]I have to stop doing this.
[328:44.08]I have to get the fuck out of here.
[328:45.12]I have to stop.
[328:50.71]I'm gonna leave.
[328:53.81]This is incredibly uncalled for.
[328:55.83]This is uncalled for.
[328:57.79]There's no reason to do what I'm doing.
[329:05.30]Alright, I didn't even do that to that guy, but I guess I'll grind on him.
[329:37.60]This is so weird.
[329:39.00]Okay, I think I might be done.
[330:06.62]He's so fast and he's so strong.
[330:08.28]This is going to be unbearable.
[330:12.30]Relain, I know you're watching backstage, which is the safest place for you to be.
[330:15.12]This guy was just running over backstage.
[330:16.52]The guy that had no health.
[330:19.48]I'll get my hands on you one day and this is just a preview of what's going to happen.
[330:22.22]Do you want strength?
[330:36.60]You wanted strength?
[330:38.34]You got it.
[330:55.57]This guy is an X-Men mutant.
[331:03.61]Jesus, it's only if you have 99 in every stat.
[331:12.60]I'm pissed right now.
[331:21.58]Why is he bringing the chair over here?
[331:38.79]Okay, he's gonna tap out.
[331:46.67]You think you can test of strength?
[331:47.69]This is a really dumb idea.
[331:48.69]What do you think you're doing?
[331:52.25]Yeah, excuse me.
[332:08.03]Get a pen!
[332:29.09]Bob knows not to get involved.
[332:30.84]That's so funny.
[332:31.68]Can't believe he hasn't tapped.
[332:38.56]It's actually pretty crazy.
[332:40.01]Alright, that's it.
[332:41.65]Yeah, no extension.
[333:04.87]X-man.
[333:05.23]I don't even care.
[333:11.00]I can't even get hurt.
[333:11.84]Nothing can hurt me.
[333:24.66]I'm a superhuman.
[333:44.64]There we go.
[333:58.54]I'm a heel.
[333:59.62]Oh no.
[334:03.70]Put it in reverse.
[334:04.44]Alright, maybe like 10 more minutes and then I'm going to call it for today.
[334:29.24]He's running from me and talking.
[334:32.50]Well, come back and talk to me then.
[334:33.96]Don't just run.
[334:49.57]Back to the subway.
[334:53.75]I'm curious just how superhuman this character is.
[334:56.41]We're going to do a test.
[335:07.57]You ran right into me.
[335:13.12]It was just dumb what he did.
[335:16.36]I don't think you want to mess with me right now.
[335:18.36]This is a big mistake.
[335:19.56]I'm just saying.
[335:20.10]I mean, this is a huge mistake.
[335:25.20]Why would you even say anything?
[335:28.12]Why would you try to attack me?
[335:30.28]He ran behind me and ran into my shit and then said, hey, watch where you're going.
[335:33.60]And then now he wants to fight me?
[335:40.11]Where are you going?
[336:03.80]Smash an announcers desk.
[336:15.79]He's fine.
[336:17.99]He really is an Avenger.
[336:20.07]He's an Avenger.
[336:22.23]He's actually an Avenger.
[336:27.15]It's like the Hulk.
[336:28.15]He can't get killed.
[336:29.73]He's super strong.
[336:33.71]He's in a bad chest.
[336:41.53]Come on.
[336:41.89]I can take one more of those.
[336:45.46]Yeah, right in the belly.
[336:46.68]Right here.
[336:47.40]Let's see it.
[337:00.18]I think I'm okay.
[337:01.68]What am I drinking?
[337:02.56]Blood?
[337:12.48]He's alright.
[337:14.04]He's fine.
[337:18.29]How many is it going to take to put me in the hospital?
[337:24.06]It's never happening.
[337:25.42]It's never going to happen.
[337:29.40]Hulk number one.
[337:35.09]You want to check it out?
[337:35.91]You want to check this out down here?
[337:39.09]Come here for a second.
[337:39.85]I want to show you something.
[337:58.88]You can't lift me.
[338:00.16]You can't lift me.
[338:03.47]You can't lift me.
[338:10.05]Am I okay?
[338:12.65]What's wrong with me?
[338:18.38]Let that be the end of it.
[338:19.10]I hope you learned your lesson.
[338:25.40]Why am I asleep?
[338:28.24]He's asleep.
[338:31.24]Oh no.
[338:39.60]Does the train come on this side?
[339:12.78]He's sleeping again!
[339:13.76]Okay, I'm done.
[339:22.87]I'm done.
[339:23.97]I'm done.
[339:24.47]No more of this.
[339:26.05]I'm done playing Wrestling Empire.
[339:28.37]It's been fun.
[339:37.62]I can die I don't think I can die I'm unkillable what's wrong with me um it's uh I'm not controlling the guy
[340:24.88]Oh, that's all.
[340:27.28]That's all.
[340:27.66]Just a little bit of uncomfortable sleep.
[340:35.45]I don't think this guy can die.
[340:43.84]Tanked four trains.
[340:53.42]Can I just not die?
[340:54.66]I lost control.
[341:05.21]You're literally the Hulk.
[341:12.33]I'm invincible.
[341:13.15]I can't die.
[341:14.21]I'm invincible.
[341:21.84]Actually, actually invincible.
[341:23.74]I've been hit so many times, dude.
[341:38.77]I can't get up but I can't die.
[341:40.69]I can't get up but I can't die.
[341:49.37]Don't tell me that's it, right?
[341:59.51]I had one match.
[342:01.07]I had one match only.
[342:02.69]The whole time.
[342:08.84]Man, I'm super powered.
[342:10.14]I'm a superhero.
[342:11.68]Wow, this is crazy.
[342:13.06]Man, might as well just run up with a train 15 times.
[342:18.90]That's how you go?
[342:19.66]What the hell are you doing?
[342:21.06]He won 100% of the matches.
[342:31.45]That took a lot though.
[342:33.17]That took a lot.
[342:39.78]Oh, what a mess.
[342:40.90]That's so funny.
[342:41.64]100% win rate.
[342:54.49]Yeah, 99 in every stat means you can get hit by the train in consecutive days about 10 times in a row.
[343:09.75]That's unbelievable.
[343:10.85]Alright.
[343:12.29]I think I'm going to call it for today.
[343:13.59]That was funny.
[343:16.43]This game is always funny.
[343:18.77]This game is always just ridiculous.
[343:19.93]Wrestling Empire.
[343:21.01]Glad to go back to it.
[343:26.61]train got us all I think right alright I will see you guys what's today let's do uh let's do Friday Saturday this weekend I think there's a bunch of stuff we can play so I want to give you guys a little insight as to what's going to be happening in 2023
[343:50.36]I want to do more streams where just chilling out playing a game I think I told you this last um late last year but I want to bring back more just hangout streams where we just play games I'm gonna do more of those this year it's oh it's 2023 yeah it is
[344:16.49]No, not Omega Gaming Weekends, but just... Like, if I just feel like playing something, I'm just gonna play it.
[344:22.52]Then that's it.
[344:28.46]But yeah, that's Wrestling Empire.
[344:29.72]That's the stream.
[344:30.79]Good to be back.
[344:32.33]I will see you guys in a couple days on Friday.
[344:35.29]Thanks for watching, as always.
[344:43.79]Yeah, streams will be- will stay in this early period too, somewhere like the noon to two.
[344:50.97]You know what I figured out?
[344:52.41]Notice how I was perfectly on time today?
[344:55.35]I got a new 2023 strategy.
[344:56.74]You ready for this?
[344:58.36]So, the sus is always... 2023.
[345:01.18]I'm gonna try it.
[345:03.72]Sus is always gonna be set at least an hour or two later than I actually really want to be live.
[345:10.80]So what's gonna end up happening is sus will be set for like 2 or 3 o'clock Pacific sometimes, right?
[345:17.51]And here's the strat.
[345:19.97]Just whenever I'm ready, let's go.
[345:22.63]And I'll just make sure that I'm always ready before the set time.
[345:26.51]And I'll make sure it's always an hour or two later than I want to be.
[345:32.97]Lying to us.
[345:34.91]Because then it doesn't matter.
[345:36.33]I will always be on time.
[345:37.95]Because if it takes until two, which it shouldn't, but if it does, I'm here.
[345:44.42]You're delaying without the shame.
[345:45.60]That's right.
[345:50.32]Delaying without the shame.
[345:52.77]Especially when our clocks are so late.
[345:59.55]Me and Holly were sitting around just laughing at what... Let's talk about this really quickly.
[346:06.50]At what point of your clocks being slow or fast is your entire life fucked up?
[346:14.48]Imagine operating at 40... After 20 minutes, everything is messed up.
[346:19.65]Nothing is correct.
[346:21.51]Yeah, even 15 minutes.
[346:24.19]So the fact that this dude is just sitting here operating on a 46-minute wrong clock, how?
[346:32.82]How is it possible?
[346:34.66]And then maybe they had something read up that was super, super meaningful, and, oh, guys, 2023, here's to this, here's to this, and you missed it, and you fucked up.
[346:45.35]And you just pissed.
[346:46.99]Like, fuck this holiday.
[346:47.91]I don't even care.
[346:49.42]Scrap the draft that I had.
[346:50.66]I'm talking about me.
[346:58.96]I don't know.
[346:59.40]I thought it was funny.
[347:02.24]Why'd you write that?
[347:02.92]I don't know, dude.
[347:04.24]Why did I pee on a water test?
[347:06.46]I don't know.
[347:08.78]I just thought it was funny.
[347:13.29]Yeah, I talked about the tweet from New Year's.
[347:16.39]I was 46 minutes late.
[347:30.81]Anyways.
[347:33.03]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[347:34.01]I don't know what we're going to do.
[347:36.03]We'll do whatever.
[347:36.65]We'll do whatever we want.
[347:37.39]There's a lot of games that have come out over the last month or two that I haven't played.
[347:43.66]So we'll get more of these.
[347:44.44]More game streams.
[347:47.24]And I'll see you later.
[347:47.98]See you Friday.
[347:49.04]Thanks for watching.
[347:49.68]Take care of yourself.
[347:57.00]Drop that.
[347:58.01]And go like this.
[348:00.15]Hey!
[348:00.73]There come the credits.
[348:07.05]There are 55 pages of credits.
[348:08.95]I've been away.
[348:11.25]Oh my god.
[348:13.29]Thanks for the subs, though, guys.
[348:16.45]That is a lot.
[348:22.23]Appreciate it.
[348:25.50]Oh, I need my music.
[348:32.52]You can't hear it.
[348:35.36]Now you can.
[348:42.78]What about your pinned tweet?
[348:43.78]I'll figure it out.
[348:49.50]Hey, I'm serious, by the way.
[348:50.24]There's actually an option to disable the white flashes in the Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.
[348:55.01]Are you serious?
[348:55.41]I'll have to look into that.
[348:57.79]Because that's what is just put me off completely.
[349:15.48]You gonna do more Breath of the Wild?
[349:17.50]Probably.
[349:19.96]Yeah, probably.
[349:26.88]Days waiting for Driver 1.
[349:28.50]1693.
[349:28.52]Didn't I play Driver 1?
[349:35.16]I played it already.
[349:37.72]Like, five years ago.
[349:44.79]Was it a different driver?
[349:52.59]Okay.
[349:54.12]Okay, fine.
[349:55.32]Fine.
[349:58.20]Where do I, how do I get driver one?
[350:02.40]I will play driver one as soon as possible.
[350:04.64]So that person can now delete their Twitter.
[350:24.95]Yeah.
[350:26.09]What should I play it on?
[350:27.07]Is it on PC?
[350:27.93]Let me check.
[350:35.05]Is Driver 1 on PC?
[350:46.99]We should do infomercial nights?
[350:48.57]No, I've got something way better, and this is precisely what we are doing on Friday.
[350:53.38]Are you ready?
[350:55.98]Those of you that left, a few thousand people left, they're not even going to get the secret what the stream is on Friday.
[351:02.05]We are going to watch.
[351:03.59]We're going to hang out.
[351:04.35]Get some cocoa and chill.
[351:09.21]And we're going to watch a shitload of 80s and 90s commercials.
[351:16.08]And we're going to break them down.
[351:19.36]We're going to talk about them.
[351:21.20]We're going to go over them.
[351:23.44]80s and 90s era commercial watch party.
[351:31.77]Yeah.
[351:39.19]Play Mega Man Legends 2.
[351:42.79]And guess what?
[351:43.90]Guess what we're doing on Saturday?
[351:46.06]The day after that.
[351:48.60]Driver 1.
[351:52.20]You don't think that 2023 is going to be a year where I tell you exactly what we're doing and I do it?
[351:55.78]Sounds like a pretty good weekend.
[352:02.87]Although I can't promise.
[352:03.69]I'll probably play for 30 minutes and despise the entire experience and leave immediately.
[352:08.93]But I will play it on Saturday.
[352:16.71]Or maybe I'll beat the whole thing.
[352:18.45]We'll see.
[352:25.14]I will reveal my present on Friday as well.
[352:35.13]You'll see.
[352:40.67]Yeah.
[352:41.87]Should be a pretty good start to 2023.
[352:46.86]Reveal.
[352:47.44]We've seen it.
[352:48.08]Well, I'm going to reveal it on stream.
[352:53.62]It's going to be fun.
[352:54.76]I'm telling you.
[352:57.39]What about Grotto Beasts?
[352:59.59]Okay, it sounds like you're giving them a present.
[353:02.65]Oh, no, no, it was a present.
[353:04.79]It was a thing that some community members helped to like get ready.
[353:10.75]And it's awesome.
[353:15.14]And you'll see why on Friday.
[353:20.74]Alright, so Grotto Beasts.
[353:23.50]You can expect to see some very, very major, major news
[353:30.80]on the Grotto Beasts release date.
[353:33.16]Incredibly so.
[353:38.49]I would say there's going to be a major, major release date reveal and potentially even beginning sales over these next two or three weeks.
[353:52.13]Okay.
[353:54.75]Okay.
[353:58.19]Okay.
[354:00.44]Alright.
[354:05.69]We're trying to get it ready and ready to be purchased.
[354:10.53]There's a lot of moving parts with this project, so it's not just quite as simple as, oh, just release it.
[354:17.39]There are 200 cards.
[354:20.03]There's a starter kit.
[354:21.30]There are booster packs.
[354:22.56]It's a whole thing.
[354:23.50]It's going to be wild.
[354:30.84]Release the Armin video.
[354:32.96]I haven't seen that in a while.
[354:34.92]Alright, guys.
[354:37.99]I'll see you on Friday.
[354:39.17]Take care of yourselves.
[354:39.77]Happy New Year.
[354:40.33]If you didn't hear me say it before.
[354:43.67]See you Friday.
