[00:16.90]Um, so I got to tell you, I'll be back in five more minutes.
[00:24.27]There is delicious food and I need to eat it.
[00:27.57]I'll be right back.
[00:33.45]I'm just going to go eat something.
[00:35.53]I'll be back.
[00:36.89]Just give me like five minutes.
[00:37.85]Not even, I'll be back at exactly four.
[00:44.86]I'll be back at 4.20.
[00:47.74]Yeah.
[00:48.95]Perfect.
[00:50.35]All right.

[09:41.36]Oh.
[09:42.64]So good.
[09:45.81]Late.
[09:46.29]Yeah.
[09:47.73]When you get into that mode where you're just eating.
[09:49.51]I was looking at the clock.
[09:51.99]It's like.
[09:55.03]It's been four hours and 20 minutes on the stream.
[10:00.29]But this next bite of delicious fried rice.
[10:04.71]Is.
[10:05.41]That's all I'm thinking of right now.
[10:11.51]all right settle down uh all right let's do isaac I'm gonna play one game of isaac we'll see oh I need I need my controller
[10:41.88]oh hold on it's in the other room one more brb I promise I'm not going to eat food
[11:24.11]you
[12:01.91]I do like the he hates streaming comment.
[12:05.56]All right, I got my tea refilled.
[12:17.92]Let's go.
[12:31.93]because it's true it's not true you dare slander me like that look isaac I kind of I want to play greed mode
[13:03.90]What is this?
[13:06.24]Easter eggs.
[13:09.54]Look at how good I am at this game, by the way.
[13:15.91]I just love playing as Samson in greed mode.
[13:20.15]That just is the way it's going to work here.
[13:22.09]Alright, it's been a little while.
[13:28.37]I have the mod still, right?
[13:29.73]Yep.
[13:32.86]One Boneheart.
[13:33.70]Should I have picked that up?
[13:37.52]Wait.
[13:38.38]What is this?
[13:45.53]Oh, he cheated.
[13:46.17]I forgot.
[13:46.61]It's a bad item.
[13:49.53]Well, I want to take hits with Samson, so... By the way, I'm going to have Wicked Bad Food voice.
[13:58.64]One of the reasons I don't like to eat before streaming.
[14:01.98]I know it's probably other streamers that have this mentality as well.
[14:06.24]But when you eat and then it's time to talk for four or five straight hours.
[14:18.27]No, that's one of the reasons why I don't really eat a lot before streaming.
[14:25.31]Yeah, you get that really bad milk voice.
[14:34.91]Alright, just hit me.
[14:36.03]Yeah, hit me.
[14:38.66]Need to do more damage than this.
[14:41.70]Bullshit.
[14:50.47]Dude, I got S++ today.
[14:53.07]I'm very proud of myself, can I just tell you?
[14:57.87]I killed 150 enemies in a row.
[15:07.88]Like I got an A for the first time on my report card and I am sprinting home to show mom.
[15:12.08]Alright, that's all the hits I want to take.
[15:27.57]It's almost like a look, look, see, see, see, ma, look.
[15:48.96]Forgot this is grittier, it's harder.
[15:50.12]I thought I died.
[16:00.14]Okay, that's a heal.
[16:08.90]Play Tainted Samson instead.
[16:11.26]I'd like the regular Samson.
[16:20.07]uh mimics isaac's movement on a 0.66 delay deals 30 contact this thing this thing kind of stinks doesn't it just restart
[16:59.95]fine it's probably actually not bad here in greed mode hey what does this guy look like um and um
[17:30.44]Like Tingle.
[17:31.50]Yeah.
[17:33.44]You know that guy Tingle from Zelda?
[17:38.96]Spitting image.
[17:58.99]He's definitely naked.
[18:02.46]That would be kind of weird to eat.
[18:04.66]Hold on a minute.
[18:05.30]I got a food voice.
[18:10.14]I don't know if I'd want to eat food naked.
[18:12.06]That would kind of be annoying.
[18:14.38]I would not like that.
[18:15.30]That would suck.
[18:28.89]I don't have enough hearts to get this.
[18:34.74]You've never done it.
[18:36.86]I don't think so.
[18:48.09]Should I get the key?
[18:49.65]Sharp key.
[18:53.13]Because if you think about it, that's a deal.
[18:56.14]That's 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
[18:56.52]That's 25 cents worth of keys.
[19:02.91]So now I don't have to worry about keys anymore.
[19:05.67]Just don't throw them.
[19:09.67]No bombs either.
[19:14.97]What the hell is that?
[19:16.65]Modeling clay?
[19:17.53]Ooh, I like that.
[19:18.33]50% chance to grant the effect of a random passive item each room.
[19:30.40]That's kind of good.
[19:35.28]I'll try it.
[19:35.62]I gotta start.
[19:43.99]I gotta do more clay stuff.
[19:45.25]I told you guys that I started doing it, right?
[19:47.55]It's not something that I've done.
[20:01.10]I don't plan on doing it on this.
[20:02.08]Oh my god, more keys.
[20:06.40]I don't plan on doing it on stream or anything.
[20:09.16]But it's like a little hobby.
[20:14.40]This is not bad here.
[20:21.49]There's a key.
[20:26.15]This is a really bad idea.
[20:27.10]I don't think I'm going to do it.
[20:29.26]King baby.
[20:48.28]Alright, let's get hurt.
[20:52.80]Come on.
[21:00.67]Keep hitting.
[21:03.03]Hit me again.
[21:03.59]One more time.
[21:09.19]Not from a champion.
[21:10.81]From a regular enemy, please.
[21:12.13]That's it.
[21:18.99]Back off.
[21:19.51]I didn't even do it right.
[21:33.79]Oh shit.
[21:34.63]Careful.
[21:50.68]What hit me?
[21:51.52]What?
[21:52.72]What was that?
[21:53.14]That run sucked.
[21:54.14]That build was awful.
[22:15.59]Yeah.
[22:19.91]What does this more do?
[22:28.35]It's over.
[22:28.67]You failed.
[22:36.94]Finally.
[22:37.92]Finally, let me do it.
[22:40.02]What?
[22:41.00]God damn it.
[22:42.42]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[22:44.42]I kept talking over it.
[22:48.00]I was talking over it.
[22:53.52]I was like, finally, I get to do the pitch down echo reverb sneeze joke that I've been waiting like a month to do.
[22:59.77]And I talked over it while it came out.
[23:06.96]That's so irritating to me.
[23:09.06]That's so... I'm actually mad about that.
[23:21.26]Somebody just wrote bless you with a bunch of question marks.
[23:28.15]I'm going to die again.
[23:28.91]Hold on.
[23:55.57]I don't even know why I care about it, too.
[23:56.85]I'm just like, yo, next time I sneeze, maybe I'll just turn on my filters.
[24:01.02]It'll be super funny.
[24:02.10]I bet you so many people are going to go.
[24:05.28]All right, this is the one.
[24:19.15]I'm going to get a bunch of dog shit items.
[24:25.05]There we go.
[24:27.55]Run is officially on.
[24:29.05]I hope you're ready.
[24:29.59]I just need a shitload of tears up and we're good.
[24:41.35]Strength.
[24:42.01]Paracord.
[24:42.77]Nice.
[24:45.29]Brainworm.
[24:47.17]Nice.
[24:47.47]Alright.
[24:51.40]Just don't screw this up.
[25:16.13]I need tears up so bad.
[25:17.19]This is slow.
[25:50.57]Alright, we're good.
[26:06.86]This could be a destructive run.
[26:08.18]As long as I don't totally blow it, then I'll be fine.
[26:13.46]Get tiers up.
[26:14.08]A ton of damage.
[26:15.46]Brain worm.
[26:16.96]Increased tier size, if it's available.
[26:31.91]I didn't even see this guy.
[26:32.75]Alright, this is range.
[26:49.70]Brain worm for sure.
[26:52.92]I'm personally begging you to buy brain worm.
[26:55.03]Oh yeah.
[26:55.29]I wasn't going to miss that.
[27:01.49]Alright.
[27:10.01]Guys, how personally invested are you in this run?
[27:31.65]Keep it going.
[27:42.11]This could be the one.
[27:43.01]I don't know how you're going to bet on it, but... Oh, by the way...
[28:00.36]I'm thinking of a crazy idea for Channel Points.
[28:03.34]I just have to make sure I can do it.
[28:07.11]So all you Channel Point Andes that have been asking about it for a long time now, I might have something cooking here.
[28:18.60]And it's pretty sick.
[28:20.54]I'm just telling you.
[28:24.90]I might have a really disappointing news when I tell you, like, oh, never mind, I can't do it.
[28:32.76]What is this?
[28:37.04]Wait, what?
[28:39.50]Maw of the Void.
[28:43.61]Will this replace my big charge tears?
[28:51.49]Take it.
[28:52.15]I only have one heart.
[28:56.08]Use the card then by it.
[29:02.26]Use the card for a free heart.
[29:06.08]Don't take it.
[29:13.31]I think this one... I'd rather have this one.
[29:17.25]I made my decision.
[29:21.69]Two damage up, right?
[29:26.74]Did it even do two damage up?
[29:31.00]Now take it.
[29:32.34]Card.
[29:32.72]What?
[29:34.07]A card.
[29:34.37]Wait.
[29:34.67]What?
[29:34.83]Everyone's yelling at me.
[29:39.01]You're a dumbass.
[29:39.79]What?
[29:40.29]I didn't.
[29:40.63]What did I do wrong?
[29:41.39]I didn't want this thing.
[29:42.47]I didn't want it.
[29:43.49]It's an active item?
[29:46.61]Fuck.
[29:48.07]I didn't want that thing.
[29:49.03]At least I get my 3D glasses.
[29:53.47]I want a bomb.
[29:59.73]Damn it.
[30:02.62]I don't care.
[30:02.96]I'm doing it.
[30:19.43]Nice.
[30:34.94]Alright, let's get out of here.
[30:37.06]How come I, why did I vote yes?
[30:40.16]You're gonna be fine.
[30:41.16]Alright, so I wanna, I wanna run over this shit.
[30:51.85]Nice.
[30:55.23]Nice.
[30:55.87]Take that up here.
[30:59.80]Nice.
[31:00.14]Nice.
[31:03.95]Uh oh.
[31:11.71]My brain worm has to go away though.
[31:16.71]That's worth it.
[31:17.39]Alright, now I want to blow this up.
[31:27.32]Nice.
[31:37.66]I think I'm going to keep the brain worm.
[31:40.60]Tinted?
[31:41.16]What do you mean?
[31:41.70]Where?
[31:52.25]Sick.
[31:57.31]Penny is a free win.
[31:59.57]Yeah, let's go for it.
[32:00.77]I want money.
[32:01.51]It's all about the money for me right now.
[32:03.21]I'm taking it.
[32:08.11]Yeah, this is great mode.
[32:22.73]Whatever that is.
[32:23.43]Double tapping a fire button makes Isaac sneeze blood.
[32:27.87]Sneeze deals 150% damage.
[32:28.53]Really?
[32:28.67]Really?
[32:37.67]That's not gonna mess with my thing, is it?
[32:45.66]Cool.
[32:46.24]It doesn't, so I can be like, boom.
[32:51.56]Here's up.
[32:58.01]Yeah, so the play is to go, let go, pop.
[33:01.45]Let go, pop.
[33:05.03]Randomly grants the effect of... None of this matters, right?
[33:22.73]What is this question mark for?
[33:23.77]Why is there a question mark up there?
[33:39.65]see the top left there's a red question mark that appears why all right let's start it the pill is behind the spikes it's an oh unknown pill right all right let's go I like the sound it makes
[34:13.08]Does this count as a brimstone or no?
[34:15.33]Just a charge move.
[34:24.35]I gotta take some hits.
[34:34.40]The money.
[34:54.31]Two damage.
[34:57.93]Ow.
[34:59.21]Ooh, nice.
[35:10.36]I'm okay taking the hits.
[35:29.03]This stinks what?
[35:30.19]My character?
[35:30.73]What?
[35:31.71]What do you mean this stinks?
[35:38.22]I just killed them all.
[35:58.08]Oh, it's only two tiers from Monstro's lungs.
[36:01.92]Many tiers.
[36:03.49]Oh, what was that?
[36:13.11]Buy the car battery.
[36:21.19]Yeah.
[36:23.79]What the hell?
[36:24.42]What about the devil room?
[36:29.09]I didn't want it.
[36:29.71]Okay.
[36:44.86]Let's get out of here.
[36:45.65]We're doing good.
[36:49.77]You had enough health?
[36:51.43]I don't want to throw any more hearts away.
[36:59.98]Cool.
[37:03.08]Huge.
[37:08.19]Although... Do I want the damage?
[37:12.59]That's a lot of damage to lose.
[37:13.59]Is it worth it?
[37:19.27]I guess it's DPS versus straight up damage, right?
[37:29.58]It's probably better.
[37:37.43]He's better be good.
[37:38.05]Fuck you.
[37:53.56]Monstro's Lung is all about high damage.
[37:55.12]You just fucked up.
[38:02.31]What do you know?
[38:04.91]Probably a lot.
[38:14.38]Actually, not even the worst thing that could have happened.
[38:18.72]Come on, give me something.
[38:19.94]Yes!
[38:21.20]Empty heart.
[38:23.32]Grants a heart container when at one red heart or less at the start of a new floor.
[38:32.74]Why can I pick this up?
[38:33.42]I have to bomb it?
[38:46.43]Huh.
[38:47.09]I've never seen that before.
[38:49.27]I just ran over that like an idiot.
[38:53.44]Range.
[38:56.88]D8.
[38:59.60]Multiplies Isaac's damage, tears, range, and speed...
[39:11.58]He's faking it?
[39:12.10]No, I'm just reading chat.
[39:15.66]I'm going to blow through this whole level.
[39:16.93]Just watch.
[39:17.25]Oh my god.
[39:29.65]Disgusting.
[39:36.09]No one even can touch me.
[39:37.25]I did that on purpose.
[39:47.48]It felt bad.
[39:56.25]What even?
[39:56.73]I honestly don't even know what keeps hitting me.
[40:40.18]I don't even want any of this stuff.
[40:44.44]Too much to give up.
[40:51.41]Seven seals?
[40:53.03]I don't know.
[40:58.96]No, I only have four hearts.
[41:00.06]It's not worth it.
[41:03.28]Look at the money I have.
[41:05.66]All right.
[41:06.44]I'm thinking about a re-roll.
[41:13.60]Come on.
[41:19.76]Oh, I definitely want this.
[41:20.48]Maybe the... I want the range.
[41:26.86]This thing is not going far at all.
[41:38.63]Yeah.
[41:41.25]I like being able to just throw it across the room like this.
[41:48.44]Oh, hell nah, he went for range.
[41:51.60]What?
[41:53.14]What?
[41:54.80]We have, oh, I like range.
[41:56.64]I like being able to hit things from far away.
[42:02.81]All right, get him going.
[42:12.45]Take some damage for a free heart container.
[42:14.01]Well, I'll do that on the next place.
[42:22.83]Oh, look at all these doubters.
[42:23.91]I'm excited.
[42:37.18]Oh, oh, oh.
[42:38.95]Everybody was just saying, why did you do that?
[42:40.73]Why did you activate the nail in here?
[42:41.87]Oh, oh, I don't know.
[42:43.35]Maybe because I could get fucking double, uh, this.
[42:45.63]Uh, double, uh, yeah.
[42:47.05]Oh, with you.
[43:04.11]Right now, everyone's on the phone trying to figure out how to refund betting channel points.
[43:13.44]Because they just saw what I just got.
[43:21.64]And that's tech .5.
[43:24.39]Occasionally fire lasers in addition to Isaac's tears.
[43:26.81]Oh, okay.
[43:27.69]Sounds great.
[43:28.91]Does it replace this?
[43:43.55]I can't lose now.
[43:44.57]It's not possible.
[44:00.77]Oops.
[44:02.05]It's alright.
[44:02.44]I'll do it again.
[44:06.32]Fanny pack.
[44:07.84]Yep.
[44:10.52]Oh.
[44:15.72]Only applies to the right eye, but these are coming out of my mouth.
[44:20.82]Does that even do anything?
[44:27.57]Yeah, I need to save money.
[44:28.39]That's true.
[44:28.63]I need to get to 49 or 50 coins here.
[44:48.82]Alright, I need to get hurt.
[45:19.83]Why are you collecting the coins?
[45:22.15]What?
[45:23.83]What are you talking about?
[45:31.06]The two of diamonds just doubles your coins.
[45:34.16]I don't think they have to be in the ground.
[45:43.19]What about the sneeze?
[45:44.51]The sneeze doesn't really do anything.
[45:46.91]Why are you reading chat?
[45:47.89]Because I'm a livestreamer!
[46:02.05]Okay.
[46:54.90]Mom walked in.
[47:06.40]Yeah, fuck you.
[47:09.67]Yeah, mom.
[47:11.63]Yeah.
[47:12.67]I'm just chilling.
[47:13.57]I'm just hanging out with friends.
[47:15.67]Yeah, I'm okay.
[47:19.89]Yeah.
[47:21.05]Good night.
[47:24.25]I'm going to get it done.
[47:34.42]Five more minutes, yeah.
[47:35.96]Okay, so I'm just going to use it now.
[47:37.88]Stop leaving the room.
[47:42.60]You just unsubscribed.
[47:43.68]Should I just take the diamonds now?
[47:49.63]Whatever.
[47:49.91]Time to go on a shopping spree.
[48:01.87]Buddy in a box.
[48:18.40]Nice.
[48:24.29]Nice.
[48:27.09]Nice.
[48:31.91]Burkano?
[48:34.39]I didn't see what it did, what it does.
[48:40.49]What's Burkano?
[48:47.44]Hold tab to see what it does.
[48:53.54]Drop it.
[48:58.93]It's the right trigger to drop everything, right?
[49:00.25]Okay.
[49:00.35]Okay.
[49:03.48]Summons three blue spiders and three blue flies.
[49:05.76]Oh, okay.
[49:06.10]That's cool.
[49:10.40]Godlike run.
[49:46.45]That technology thing is awesome.
[49:52.31]Save money, save money, save money.
[49:59.55]Oh no, it's Krampus.
[50:03.87]I think I'd rather have the two damage.
[50:14.62]And that's it.
[50:25.11]The nail is just two free damage.
[50:26.37]Almost there.
[50:45.44]Yes, what the fuck?
[50:46.80]Isn't chocolate milk- won't that override?
[50:52.00]No, I don't want that.
[50:52.86]That's gonna override everything.
[50:58.41]This definitely doesn't stack.
[51:05.11]Oh, I see.
[51:05.65]A lot of you guys are going to lose a lot of channel points if I don't take that.
[51:12.06]I see.
[51:12.36]That's why a lot of you are saying it.
[51:28.13]We literally believe.
[51:29.29]There's no way this guy's serious.
[51:30.67]Wait, is that for real?
[51:33.25]You'll never know if it stacks or not if you don't take it.
[51:43.71]What, uh... Please take it, I beg of you.
[51:51.09]Does anybody actually know if it stacks?
[51:52.81]I'm terrified to actually touch this.
[51:58.05]Ask ChatGPT.
[52:00.85]Hey, ChatGPT.
[52:01.93]Does chocolate milk and Monstro's tooth... I'm not picking it up.
[52:20.77]I don't want to touch it.
[52:21.91]I'll look it up.
[52:25.50]Does Monstro's tooth and chocolate milk stack?
[52:36.51]Yeah, Monstro's lung, sorry.
[52:39.41]Does Monstro's lung and chocolate milk stack?
[52:47.42]What?
[52:49.02]It does.
[52:50.28]Holy shit.
[52:59.57]Dude, are you serious?
[53:01.95]That's just 400% more.
[53:03.60]I thought you guys were just fucking with me.
[53:06.86]All right, let's do it.
[53:25.44]I can't see.
[53:26.18]There's so much saliva in my mouth.
[53:28.68]Why is there so much saliva in my mouth?
[53:31.18]What happened?
[53:42.77]I don't know where that came from.
[53:43.70]That was weird.
[54:02.94]Nice.
[54:03.44]Okay.
[54:03.82]I got plenty of hearts.
[54:08.28]In the Binding of Isaac, Chocolate Milk and Monstro's Lung do synergize with each other.
[54:12.42]When these two items are combined, the player can charge up Monstro's Lung more quickly by repeatedly tapping the shoot button, which causes Isaac to shoot a barrage of tears in a short amount of time.
[54:21.98]This results in a very powerful attack that can deal a lot of damage to enemies.
[54:25.78]Additionally, the charge shots from Monstro's Lung are affected by Chocolate Milk's damage multiplier, which can... What is going on?
[54:38.11]ChatGPT, you say that?
[54:41.51]Why did I leave the room?
[54:59.38]Tap, don't hold.
[55:00.24]Dude, ChatGPT told me to tap.
[55:06.32]It's more effective.
[55:20.83]I don't fucking like this computer shit.
[55:22.16]I don't like the computers to do this.
[55:25.79]I don't like the computers to tell us this.
[55:27.01]I don't like computers.
[55:28.01]I don't like computers anymore.
[56:01.70]Here comes the Amish rant.
[56:07.37]Ooh.
[56:10.95]Let's poop.
[56:12.93]Moving?
[56:13.21]Ah, I don't like that.
[56:17.68]Hmm.
[56:18.72]Is that worth taking that?
[56:27.92]Probably not.
[56:38.24]D1 duplicates a random pickup in the room.
[56:41.78]Thanks.
[56:42.08]Thanks.
[56:42.32]I don't even care if I get hurt.
[56:46.34]Giga Shad.
[57:01.21]Tears.
[57:02.17]Nice.
[57:04.07]Is that, wait, is that tears up again?
[57:09.04]No.
[57:19.33]Reroll it?
[57:21.19]Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[57:30.16]Metronome?
[57:33.84]Yep.
[57:36.53]Uh-huh.
[57:42.78]Holy shit.
[57:43.64]Oh, I'm at the tier cap.
[57:55.81]Should I get this?
[57:59.59]Oh, I'm the reroll machine?
[58:04.49]Smart.
[58:07.91]Okay, let's go.
[58:13.08]Get it.
[58:13.34]With the battery.
[58:24.51]Max two per room.
[58:26.91]No, I think I'm just going to go for it.
[58:32.68]Only one more floor anyways.
[58:47.36]Ooh, Guppy's tail.
[58:48.44]Might as well.
[58:55.12]Destroying Poop spawns one blue fly.
[59:02.23]Eh.
[59:02.93]I'm already at the... Ooh, yeah.
[59:11.01]Ace of clubs.
[59:14.51]Turns all pickup chests and non-boss items into bombs.
[59:17.42]Kind of dull.
[59:24.94]Tower.
[59:25.20]This one's a super one.
[59:31.39]Devil 2, whatever it is.
[59:37.13]Activates the Bible.
[59:38.43]Grants Seraphim.
[59:40.27]Grants flight.
[59:41.13]Lasts for 30 seconds.
[59:44.93]I remember that's there.
[60:18.79]Where's this boss that's still alive?
[60:20.15]Oh, it's this guy.
[60:23.33]Okay.
[60:41.45]I want full, like, endgame Legend of Zelda Heart Rose.
[60:45.65]I don't want this...
[60:50.96]That's not enough for Omega Grade.

[61:42.96]I'm pretty confident.
[61:46.77]We're sending so many offerings to summon you into your Roblox world right now.
[61:52.46]I don't think I can make it.

[63:21.31]Alright, wait.
[63:21.77]There's an order I gotta do this in.
[63:25.40]What did I just do?
[63:26.42]I'm fine.

[63:31.81]Use stars right now.
[63:36.77]What did I just get?
[63:38.57]Your oldest passive item was the key item.
[63:41.51]Really?
[63:43.57]Don't use it.
[63:44.35]Wait, people are saying don't do it.
[63:46.99]Alright.
[63:47.77]No.
[63:49.17]I got the devil.
[63:50.21]I'm ready to go take on greed.
[63:51.88]Let's do it.
[63:53.50]Do not use it.
[63:54.16]Don't use it.
[63:54.64]Don't use it.
[63:57.74]all right doubters are telling you not to do it it really wait my oldest item is the nail not the key is that how that works
[64:25.96]Nail's not passive.
[64:27.52]Oh.
[64:29.55]What's the first passive item?
[64:41.15]Oldest passive item.
[64:42.62]Ignoring starter items.
[64:48.66]Bloodlust is the oldest.
[64:52.20]He doesn't do anything?
[65:13.57]Andorra's box.
[65:20.87]What is it?
[65:21.23]What does it do?
[65:23.30]This thing's OP.
[65:25.16]Single you spawns rewards based on floor.
[65:28.46]What floor am I technically on for greed?
[65:29.96]Is it a chest?
[65:39.71]One coin, man.
[65:40.43]Alright, I'm ready.
[65:41.77]Let's go.
[65:42.21]Give me the devil card.
[65:42.87]Let's go.
[65:46.03]I'm ready.
[65:46.33]I'm not messing around.
[65:51.67]Alright, everybody.
[65:52.27]This is it.
[65:53.25]Let's see how you voted.
[66:05.92]Alright, this is kind of... This is kind of ridiculous.
[66:15.53]I could blow it, though.
[66:33.76]I think we're gonna be fine.
[66:35.14]I'm a little slow, but it's alright.
[67:13.65]Holy shit.
[67:15.33]A coupon!
[67:17.17]What?
[67:17.31]Who cares?
[67:19.03]Okay, slow down, slow down.
[67:19.89]What am I doing?
[67:23.23]I don't care about that.
[67:28.96]I should have gotten that excited.
[67:37.76]Yeah, this is for free.
[67:39.91]Sorry, doubters.
[67:43.44]No refunds right now.
[67:47.79]I apologize.
[67:48.37]This is the way it is.
[68:17.52]Alright, should I throw a joke?
[68:24.64]Should I take myself down to half a heart?
[68:25.82]Just to give the doubters a little bit of a... You know, just so they don't all leave at the same time.
[68:35.05]Oh, never mind.
[68:46.45]Cool.
[68:50.93]That was a good one.
[68:53.35]Don't patronize me.
[69:03.40]Chat carried you?
[69:04.12]I mean, chat helped make decisions.
[69:09.12]Of course they did.
[69:15.08]I don't know.
[69:15.34]I feel like you can't play Isaac unless there's somebody... Unless there's somebody sitting next to you telling you what items you should get.
[69:22.88]And honestly, I do that for other people.
[69:29.16]I feel like I'm so confused half the time that I play Isaac.
[69:33.47]But if I'm watching somebody play Isaac, they're getting a ton of advice.
[69:38.23]I'm telling them everything.
[69:39.19]Oh, Tinted Rock over there.
[69:41.59]Check the secret room.
[69:42.91]Top right room, probably secret room.
[69:47.78]So, yeah.
[69:53.14]It's a very backseat game.
[70:03.02]Advice from you, nobody.
[70:06.30]Hey.
[70:08.60]I know a thing or two about Isaac.
[70:13.21]He must have just joined the stream.
[70:14.31]Top left.
[70:17.22]Just want to make sure you see all 100% of the game.
[70:24.57]Well, somebody else did.
[70:26.33]Then I installed it on my computer.
[70:29.31]But it's on my machine, so technically I own it.
[70:31.05]Alright, that's going to be it.
[70:40.56]I'll see you guys later.
[70:41.28]I might stream this weekend.
[70:42.36]I told you I wanted to do old ads.
[70:45.63]That's possible.
[70:47.43]I would say if not Sunday, then maybe Monday.
[70:50.73]There's a couple of things I really fun.
[71:00.77]Just jump around playing games.
[71:05.03]Slow it down.
[71:05.53]Chill it out a little bit.
[71:06.85]Hope you had a good time.
[71:20.17]It's a good way to wake up.
[71:21.49]Yeah, some of you probably are just getting up.
[71:33.48]Yeah, keep an eye out.
[71:35.54]I'll let you know.
[71:36.02]That's the plan though.
[71:42.20]We'll go back to Breath of the Wild as well.
[71:46.48]Not immediately, but obviously after we do some of this watch stuff and do some React Andy this weekend or into early this coming week.
[72:04.62]What about the new Hollow Knight?
[72:06.87]Maybe.
[72:10.32]What time this weekend?
[72:12.38]It's usually 6 p.m.
[72:13.92]Pacific in the more recent months.
[72:25.63]Let me get the right music on.
[72:26.87]This is not the correct music.
[72:33.53]Neither is that.
[72:38.01]Where's the music?
[72:46.24]Where's the music?
[72:49.60]Actually, I moved it to a different folder.
[72:51.17]Where the hell is it?
[73:00.57]There it is.
[73:01.13]See you guys soon.
[73:19.11]It's been 219 days since your last sorcery stream.
[73:22.67]Yeah.
[73:25.91]Yeah.
[73:30.34]We'll get to it.
[73:31.16]I promise.
[73:31.56]Just can't give you a day.
[73:34.40]We'll see.
[73:34.76]Take care of yourselves.
[73:42.29]Call your mother mother.
[73:44.29]Have a good start to your weekend.
[73:46.57]See you very soon.
[73:50.43]Take it easy.
[74:50.65]Thank you.
[75:25.51]you
