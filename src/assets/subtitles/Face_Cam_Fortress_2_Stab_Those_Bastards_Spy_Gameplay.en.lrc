[00:08.53]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.31]Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2 Saturday's Edition.
[00:14.53]And... Oh!
[00:16.89]I just got a headshot.
[00:17.47]Today I'm going to be, as you see, playing as the spy in this beautiful Saturday afternoon.
[00:23.82]And we're going to, like, lose right now.
[00:27.20]I never play spy.
[00:28.80]Live, at least.
[00:29.56]And you are getting backstabbed.
[00:31.17]No, you're not.
[00:33.86]Um, we are gonna... I can't even think.
[00:37.48]Let's get out here.
[00:38.50]This is on a bad water, as you can probably see.
[00:45.51]On the screen here.
[00:46.55]Let me kill this heavy.
[00:49.13]This heavy medic pair are dead.
[00:51.05]They are toast.
[00:55.99]One.
[00:58.69]Give me that headshot.
[00:59.43]I got it.
[01:01.38]What's going on?
[01:01.88]I'm stuck.
[01:02.86]Oh my god, I'm, like, legit stuck in that thing!
[01:06.70]I'm just, like, standing... That was stupid.
[01:10.44]I got, like, legit sandwiched into, like, the wedge of that dome thing.
[01:17.71]Ah, that's a good V8 fusion.
[01:21.35]Oh my god, this is a long respawn here.
[01:25.95]So, Spy, you know...
[01:32.80]I want to take something off, but I don't want to take something off.
[01:36.52]We're just going to stick with it.
[01:37.38]You know, whatever.
[01:39.10]We can hold them for over seven minutes.
[01:42.37]Probably not.
[01:46.63]Oh, no.
[01:46.95]I want to go as a... Oh, let me just turn this corner.
[01:51.59]Hi, everybody!
[01:52.51]Like, I'm just dead.
[01:53.33]I'm still Bergaphone.
[01:58.69]I need to, like, change my...
[02:08.11]At least he killed him.
[02:11.15]Frontier justice.
[02:15.11]Come on, back up right into me.
[02:16.71]Back up right into me!
[02:18.63]Oh, the anger in that knife!
[02:21.89]Why am I standing right in the open here?
[02:24.95]Ow.
[02:25.11]Let's change to a pyro.
[02:29.10]Right here.
[02:32.14]See if I can't do something.
[02:37.52]That guy just, like, that guy knew.
[02:38.68]I should have just jumped down.
[02:41.81]What am I doing?
[02:43.99]Instead, I just stared right at the guy's face.
[02:46.25]I was just like, Hi, like, I spy.
[02:48.87]Like, who are you?
[02:51.57]Should have jumped down and stabbed the heavy, but no.
[02:55.03]I wanted to get overzealous.
[02:55.97]I wanted to get behind everybody.
[02:56.97]That was a stupid idea.
[02:59.73]But it's okay.
[03:00.71]Because they still have not gotten close to capping this.
[03:04.66]They were close.
[03:06.24]Not anymore, though.
[03:08.69]Let's go sniper.
[03:09.57]I'm gonna take out the SMG.
[03:16.53]Oh, by the way, if you don't know what I'm doing, I'm hitting B when I change my weapons.
[03:21.02]When you do that, you switch to your... I just feel bad about that.
[03:28.88]You switch to the weapon that's in that slot for that class.
[03:34.90]Oh my god, that was sick.
[03:37.65]That wasn't even my- I didn't even do that either.
[03:39.75]Oh my god, I gotta play.
[03:42.65]That was just like the sloppiest like- Oh, it's fine.
[03:48.15]That was one of the sloppiest like- That was a reverse stair stab.
[03:52.35]He like jumped over me, and I'm back- Oh my god.
[03:58.91]That guy just killed himself.
[04:00.21]Oh my god.
[04:04.62]This is turning out to be, like, quite the spy round.
[04:07.48]Like, so much goofy crap happening.
[04:13.68]Oh, what are you gonna shoot?
[04:19.63]I wanted to shoot him in the face so bad.
[04:21.19]Why didn't the first one register?
[04:23.89]God dang it.
[04:29.07]Oh.
[04:31.01]What the hell was in that?
[04:35.27]Ugh!
[04:35.41]Alright, well you just got like a live reaction of me swallowing like a mosquito that was in my drink.
[04:43.56]Ugh.
[04:44.46]The hell?
[04:46.82]Is Otto still in here?
[04:48.58]Oh shhh.
[04:49.14]He's sleeping.
[04:56.42]Okay, let's do this now.
[04:57.50]Let's do this.
[05:00.32]Gotta get into try-hard mode.
[05:01.76]That's when my eyes peer down like that.
[05:03.44]It means I'm, like, trying really hard.
[05:05.44]And it means this guy is... What a nice shot that was.
[05:07.84]Holy crap.
[05:11.50]What is this guy doing?
[05:13.46]I can't, like, decloak next to him.
[05:15.13]Because, like, that guy... Wow.
[05:16.49]I just, like, screwed myself up.
[05:17.91]Maybe he won't even know.
[05:20.55]Oh, he won't know.
[05:24.73]Oh, get him.
[05:27.31]Any snipers?
[05:28.39]There is a sniper.
[05:30.11]Oh, come on.
[05:31.54]Give me that headshot.
[05:32.74]Oh, give me that headshot.
[05:34.26]Give it to me.
[05:34.72]I want it so bad.
[05:35.78]I want it so... No!
[05:44.38]God.
[05:51.28]Oh, well.
[05:53.15]You can't get them all.
[05:55.61]Wish I could, though.
[05:58.41]Oh, I'm like, this thing's giving me like burp gas too, like jeez louise, I'm gonna like puke on the screen.
[06:08.55]You are definitely a actual engineer.
[06:12.00]I'm sorry for ever doubting you.
[06:15.48]I gotta stop changing to the same damn thing over and over again.
[06:17.80]Let's go, uh... Alright, let's do this.
[06:23.02]Get on that cot, guys, we gotta like save the day, and I just bumped into somebody.
[06:29.45]I might as well just, okay, thank you.
[06:33.55]Thank you.
[06:34.03]Alright, this guy, I'm gonna get it this time.
[06:38.14]Alright, I got it that time.
[06:42.68]If I screwed that one up, I would have peed my pants.
[06:50.28]I killed this, what?
[06:52.22]What just even happened right there?
[06:57.62]Okay, I'm like flabbergasted right now.
[07:03.08]Oh, Heavy, you don't even know what's going on here.
[07:09.84]Now I gotta run all the way... You know what?
[07:15.48]I hate when that happens.
[07:17.66]You see, I had a beeline for that Heavy, but there was like a sentry going up.
[07:22.76]See, I was gonna do what this guy just did.
[07:24.18]You know, maybe he just succeeded.
[07:25.28]Let's see.
[07:25.62]Come on.
[07:27.06]Oh, it's okay.
[07:29.37]Surprisingly, we have held this for this long.
[07:32.31]And, oh, come on.
[07:33.21]We can't lose this.
[07:33.99]What did that guy say?
[07:38.97]I have my voice turned down so low.
[07:40.97]I can't hear anything.
[07:44.25]Oh, the Powerjack.
[07:47.10]Get that.
[07:48.20]Get up.
[07:49.42]That's fine.
[07:50.82]Let's go heavy.
[07:52.08]Skazan has a heavy.
[07:55.76]Doctor!
[07:59.04]That's what I wanted.
[08:00.28]That's what I wanted.
[08:01.30]Oh, why didn't I bring it out?
[08:04.73]How much... Hold on.
[08:06.83]How much health did I just have right there?
[08:09.33]Did I have 180 health?
[08:12.23]I didn't even pay attention.
[08:15.25]That item is...
[08:18.91]Really awesome and totally fine to use.
[08:21.30]We're gonna win.
[08:29.82]Nice smash.
[08:30.86]Nice smash, dude.
[08:32.70]Nice smash, dude.
[08:35.35]Okay.
[08:36.49]Alright, don't screw this up.
[08:37.79]Let's go.
[08:38.19]Let's go, baby.
[08:43.41]Oh, don't screw this up now, baby.
[08:48.92]He is going to spray everywhere.
[08:50.28]No, don't turn around.
[08:51.98]Don't turn around.
[08:57.70]We're going to win.
[08:58.68]We'll win.
[08:59.65]See, when I play Spy, this is how I get.
[09:01.59]I get like... I get like all shaky and jittery and crazy.
[09:06.09]Especially live.
[09:08.83]We're going to do it.
[09:10.33]Last point defense.
[09:14.04]Oh, I don't know.
[09:15.90]Still a Demoman.
[09:16.80]Still a Demoman on the point.
[09:19.67]No, that's it.
[09:21.19]That's it.
[09:21.81]Good game, guys.
[09:22.65]Nice job, team.
[09:24.13]Top.
[09:25.39]Okay, I'll take it.
[09:26.43]That's gonna be it.
[09:28.46]Thanks a lot, guys, for watching.
[09:29.80]And let me get one person.
[09:30.86]Let me just, like, smoke one person.
[09:32.24]Come on.
[09:33.82]Mmm, you took it from me.
[09:37.22]But yeah, take care, buddy.
[09:38.62]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[09:42.46]Otto?
[09:43.36]Are you sleeping still?
