[00:08.74]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.34]Jerma here with Basecamp Fortress 2!
[00:17.66]Damn it!
[00:18.89]Anyways, playing as the Soldier on Barn Blitz, using the, let's just take a look, Beggar's Bazooka, the Buff Banner, and the Escape Plan.
[00:26.93]Also got on my Something Special for Someone Special, Helmet Without a Home, and the Summer Shades.
[00:32.71]So, what did I want to talk?
[00:34.18]Oh yeah, I wanted to bring up the fact that I just got back from Virginia.
[00:37.40]Sister's birthday party was a success.
[00:39.16]Thank you to everybody that said happy birthday to my sister.
[00:42.98]She really appreciates it, as well as me.
[00:46.24]Now, let's get out here.
[00:49.22]These pyros!
[00:50.14]Give me that health!
[00:52.66]Come on!
[00:53.76]Please heal me!
[00:55.88]Oh, this is starting out starting very badly.
[00:57.80]Oh, wow, we're dead.
[00:59.73]Let's go ahead.
[01:00.39]We're on barn blitz right now, right?
[01:02.75]Let's go ahead and make some animal noises.
[01:04.53]How does that sound?
[01:05.21]Ready?
[01:06.49]So, we're gonna go with a cow first.
[01:10.09]So how does a cow, what does a cow do?
[01:12.01]My god, we can't even get out of spawn!
[01:15.31]Let me just do my cow noises!
[01:18.11]I think we're gonna get spawn trapped this whole game.
[01:20.07]I don't think we're gonna get out.
[01:20.91]Hold on.
[01:21.49]Brain check on those noises.
[01:25.68]Get up there.
[01:29.28]Where's the soldier?
[01:30.06]Get outta here!
[01:32.01]Somebody... Okay, I gotta... I'm going up here.
[01:34.94]I'm going around the other side.
[01:36.52]Forget this.
[01:37.08]Oh, there's a sentry!
[01:41.42]Got it.
[01:42.64]Get this pyro.
[01:43.77]Got him.
[01:48.11]Oh, I got him too.
[01:50.05]Somebody please cap the cart.
[01:51.39]Come on.
[01:52.05]We need this extra time.
[01:52.95]There you go.
[01:55.04]There you go.
[01:55.50]There you go.
[01:56.84]Uber on the cart.
[01:57.50]This is fantastic.
[02:00.62]Oh, I'm all, like, giddy right now.
[02:03.14]Excellent.
[02:03.98]Boys and girls, you did it.
[02:06.64]So, uh, I was gonna do barnyard noises because we're in Barn Blitz.
[02:10.28]That's a spy.
[02:12.21]I always think snipers are spies.
[02:13.69]Every time.
[02:15.63]Whoa.
[02:16.93]They are!
[02:17.49]Snipers are spies every single time you see one.
[02:20.17]If there's a sniper that you see that looks like he's on your team, he's a spy.
[02:23.92]That's, like, the case 99% of the time for me.
[02:26.24]Alright, let's get out of here.
[02:29.99]One, two, three, go!
[02:33.95]Give me the, give me the, come on!
[02:36.41]No medic, no medic!
[02:40.26]No!
[02:40.90]No, I refuse to be burned to death!
[02:46.98]Before I die, alright.
[02:48.18]Now I can do the barnyard noises.
[02:49.64]I promised you I would do this.
[02:50.54]I didn't really promise, but... Alright, so here we go.
[02:53.94]Let's start with the cow.
[03:00.39]That doesn't sound like a cow at all.
[03:02.48]That sounds... That sounds like a cow on, like, crack.
[03:07.72]First hole, let me burp.
[03:09.48]Let's do a chicken.
[03:11.54]Of course, chickens are on farms as well.
[03:13.75]Sorry, let's go with the chicken.
[03:14.61]Ready?
[03:16.45]Why am I holding down the button?
[03:18.61]I can do a chicken pretty damn well.
[03:22.29]I can do a chicken pretty damn well.
[03:27.35]What does that look like on camera?
[03:28.57]I probably look like a fool.
[03:31.01]And a pig, let's do a pig.
[03:33.87]Oh my god, we got a hacker!
[03:35.30]Oh!
[03:36.00]Oh my god!
[03:38.10]No!
[03:46.62]Dude!
[03:48.67]I just wanted to make animal noises and this, like, hacker had to ruin everything.
[03:54.73]Report.
[03:55.39]How do you report him?
[03:56.63]Where's F7?
[03:58.89]Abuse report.
[03:59.53]Let's go.
[04:00.72]Submit now.
[04:02.28]There he is.
[04:03.16]There he is.
[04:03.68]There's the hacker.
[04:06.30]Oh my god, what's his name?
[04:09.46]Hold on a second.
[04:13.22]That was just such a chain of insane events.
[04:17.68]Gotcha, I gotcha.
[04:19.88]Mhm, mmm, hmm. Let the heals spreat around, spread all in your face.
[04:27.88]Overheal, overheal.
[04:30.00]Maybe we'll just win this instantly? That would be pretty crazy.
[04:34.00]Watch it! Watch it, man. Ah!
[04:40.00]That pyro is a- holy crap. Ugh I didn't get that pyro in time.
[04:44.00]Trying to heal everybody - I'm only one person!
[04:49.00]No.
[04:50.82]He died right in front of me.
[04:54.06]Go, go, go, go, go.
[04:56.80]Medic on medic.
[04:59.40]Is this guy charged?
[05:00.10]No, this guy's not charged yet.
[05:02.22]He will be soon.
[05:02.92]You know what?
[05:04.43]We're going to go out here.
[05:05.21]Me and this soldier.
[05:07.33]Boom!
[05:09.87]This could be it.
[05:10.49]This could be it.
[05:11.45]Right away.
[05:15.01]Let's go.
[05:15.75]Cabot.
[05:16.49]Cabot.
[05:17.99]Come on.
[05:18.29]Come on up here.
[05:19.19]Oh!
[05:19.90]Get clubbed.
[05:21.38]Yeah, alright.
[05:22.20]Well, that's one way to win.
[05:25.31]Come here.
[05:27.23]Wait, that was a spy?
[05:29.39]Interesting.
[05:31.03]But anyways, um... Let's do one more.
[05:34.19]One more round.
[05:34.90]Because that was, uh... That was a little too quick.
[05:41.22]Mission begins in ten seconds.
[05:42.78]Gonna skip the setup time, though, for sure.
[05:45.54]Alright, let's push on out of here.
[05:48.31]Let's push on out of here with as much might and mystery.
[05:52.89]Whoa!
[05:54.25]Huntsman, Sniper, Uber, you want it?
[05:55.87]You want a Huntsman, Sniper, Uber?
[05:57.17]Is that what you're saying?
[05:58.71]No, screw that.
[06:00.45]Here we... No, don't run away from me!
[06:03.67]Let's get a second Uber on this guy.
[06:09.62]Do we even need it?
[06:10.22]Oh my goodness, just running around with an Uber.
[06:15.35]This is bad.
[06:16.25]This team, we're crushing this team right now.
[06:18.16]My goodness gracious.
[06:21.74]Why doesn't it just run in?
[06:22.80]Just run in.
[06:23.30]They probably don't have any defenses.
[06:25.54]Whoa, yeah, they do.
[06:26.26]Come on, we need somebody.
[06:29.18]We need somebody.
[06:29.56]We need like a heavy.
[06:30.16]Come on, heavy.
[06:31.68]Here we are.
[06:32.20]Here we go.
[06:34.79]Move on up.
[06:35.41]I'll take the heat.
[06:36.09]I'll take the heat.
[06:38.67]Oh, come on.
[06:39.39]Get rid of that sentry.
[06:42.03]Kill that sentry.
[06:45.31]Oh, come on, I got it, I got the engineer!
[06:50.02]I got you, I got you guys.
[06:51.12]I'm only one person, I'm only one person, though.
[06:54.12]You're good, you're good.
[06:57.02]Come here, man.
[06:58.98]Come here, sister.
[07:00.28]Sistar.
[07:04.72]Get that spy!
[07:08.50]We're gonna win right now, oh my goodness gracious, that's two in a row!
[07:13.41]Well, these teams might need to be balanced, but... Abuse report ready to submit.
[07:19.01]I don't even know how to... The guy was changing his name.
[07:23.57]But anyways, thank you guys so much for watching.
[07:25.48]I really do appreciate it.
[07:26.36]That's going to wrap it up here.
[07:28.06]Sorry about the hacker.
[07:29.76]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[07:31.32]And of course, take care, everybody.
