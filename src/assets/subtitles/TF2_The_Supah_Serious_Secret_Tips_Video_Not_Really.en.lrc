[00:08.63]Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10.77]My name is Hector Arfieri.
[00:14.09]I'm here to teach you the secret strategies of Team Fortress 2.
[00:19.33]Some of the unspoken things that most people don't talk about.
[00:23.39]But let's not dilly-dally anymore.
[00:26.40]We're going to get started right now.
[00:29.50]Are you ready?
[00:31.28]First of all, you want to make sure your settings are all in order before you start the game.
[00:37.68]So make sure you go to your settings, pull up the audio and video files, and make the proper adjustments.
[00:45.30]Now, once that is done, you want to change your FOV to no more than 90 at a 1920x1080 resolution, because there is so much evidence and so much mathematics in state as to why you should never have it past 90 FOV.
[00:56.07]But I will not go into those details, just make sure that it's no more than...
[01:01.30]90.
[01:02.24]But Victor, what if I don't know what my best resolution is?
[01:06.02]Timmy the Boy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07.94]Timmy the Boy.
[01:08.78]There he is.
[01:09.64]Joining my video and fucking it all up.
[01:13.24]Thanks, Timmy.
[01:15.96]Now I shall teach you how to activate the hit sounds in Team Fortress 2.
[01:21.71]It's actually very simple.
[01:23.23]You go to that clicket.
[01:25.99]Here you will find a beautiful arrangement of all kinds of different things to activate or potentially deactivate.
[01:34.26]There they are.
[01:35.24]How beautiful!
[01:36.94]And the default ding noise is actually pretty annoying.
[01:40.90]So what we're going to do is change it to something a little more excellent.
[01:53.33]Perfect!
[01:55.64]But Victor, how do I install the TF2 sound in the TF2 folder?
[02:01.16]Um, I really have no idea how to do that.
[02:04.02]It could be pretty difficult.
[02:05.26]It could be quite easy.
[02:07.06]I just... I don't... Maybe somebody... Help!
[02:09.86]Help!
[02:11.56]And the final Team Fortress 2 super secret strategy is none other than how to use the developer console.
[02:24.88]You can change your weapon model FOV.
[02:27.26]You can change your FOV.
[02:28.94]You can change your FOV.
[02:31.16]You can disable your FOV.
[02:34.20]You can do so many things with this.
[02:36.80]I just spit in my own face.
[02:40.22]I hope you enjoyed this beautiful arrangement of clips of how to become a team.
[02:46.39]Hey!
[02:46.81]Yeah?
[02:48.05]You're being really loud.
[02:50.27]I'm sorry.
[02:51.27]It's all right.
[02:51.91]Just be a little more quiet next time.
[02:54.25]Okay.
[03:03.37]Well shit.
