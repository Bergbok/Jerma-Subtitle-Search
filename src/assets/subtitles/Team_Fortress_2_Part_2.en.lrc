[01:23.94]Oh Yeah, yeah.
[01:26.41]Well, let's try it.
[01:27.57]Let's play a little TF2.
[01:28.81]Why the fuck not?
[01:32.77]Let's cap this fucking piece of shit stream
[01:44.42]I can see you guys.
[01:46.06]Sure.

[02:14.66]I've been live for two minutes.
[02:19.96]Watch this crash too.
[02:24.95]How's the, uh, how's the audio?
[02:26.59]What do I, what do I even got?
[02:28.23]HUD 3D characters, that's fine.
[02:30.13]How do you play TF2?
[02:31.13]Oh god, I gotta like change that shit.
[02:38.96]Is my FOV even correct?
[02:47.27]This is not right.
[02:53.00]I knew something was wrong.
[03:01.39]View model FOV 90.
[03:02.73]Like yeah, I just reinstalled the game.
[03:05.67]We're going to the audio video files.
[03:16.13]This is loud.
[03:16.79]This is really loud too.
[03:21.05]What's my name here?
[03:21.83]Greg?
[03:23.01]Oh, this is gonna drop a lot.
[03:29.52]Do a gameplay commentary.
[03:34.92]Motion blur is even on?
[03:36.38]Yeah.
[03:37.42]Fucking turn it off.
[03:39.64]Multi-core rendering of motion... Where's motion blur?
[03:46.41]Where is it?
[03:49.92]Get out of here.
[03:52.00]This needs to be... Everything needs to be on a high... Very high.
[03:57.48]Very high.
[04:00.45]So high.
[04:01.55]So extremely high.
[04:02.77]Oh no.
[04:16.82]Hey, look at that!
[04:18.95]What am I... I don't want to play as this ship.
[04:20.67]What do I want to do?
[04:21.23]I haven't played in like a long time.
[04:22.75]Let's go with like... Let's go demo with... That's not what I wanted to do at all.
[04:28.65]How do I get this off the screen now?
[04:34.88]New loadout.
[04:36.00]Let's go with... I'm going to do standard grenade launcher.
[04:43.18]Uh, let's just, this is okay.
[04:45.33]Loadouts, I don't understand.
[04:46.53]Let's go.
[04:49.33]That fast switch has to go on, too.
[04:51.45]Like, no fucking way.
[04:56.33]How do I, where's that?
[04:57.23]There it is.
[05:01.03]Okay.
[05:03.25]So, okay, that's better.
[05:06.25]This weapon FOV's gotta go down, too.
[05:12.00]Right mouse button is not detonating.
[05:13.92]Now it is, okay.
[05:25.23]I forget this game still exists!
[05:31.72]Can we, like, cap this night by saying, like, fuck Microsoft?
[05:36.41]for having the most convoluted piece of shit fucking store I've ever used in my life.
[05:41.17]Let's end the stream by saying that.
[05:51.22]For somebody that hasn't played in fucking 10 years, not doing so terrible.
[05:58.00]Sensitivity has to go down too.
[06:04.03]wouldn't be a stream without oh wouldn't be okay well we got a hacker in here so let's like leave this stream just like riding a bike ping settings what does that mean those are hours by the way those aren't minutes
[06:36.12]There's a lot of nuanced things that I need to, like, re-enable.
[06:48.03]Any more hackers?
[06:48.81]Are we good?
[06:49.69]Any hacks right now?
[06:50.55]I think we're good.
[06:56.29]No?
[06:56.67]Okay, we win.
[07:00.94]Those are ours, by the way.
[07:01.92]Yeah, I'm pretty badass.
[07:05.31]I'm just so frustrated with the fact that, like... I mean, you've heard me say it a thousand times, but, like, why the fuck was that so difficult to play Red Dead Redemption?
[07:17.48]Like, how fucking hard is it to do that?
[07:20.04]I don't understand.
[07:27.80]Like, I just, I wanted to play Red Dead fucking Redemption.
[07:32.57]And there were so many hoops to jump through to do it.
[07:37.50]That's what I wanted to do.
[07:45.58]Like, what the fuck is the deal there?
[07:49.30]Stop complaining, make jokes.
[07:50.38]This is a complaint stream.
[07:51.48]I already told you that's what this is gonna be.
[07:57.18]If you were here for the first fucking hour and a half, you'd realize why this is just a complaint stream.
[08:04.85]And I don't want it to be.
[08:05.91]Trust me, I don't want it to be a complaint stream.
[08:09.47]By any means.
[08:10.07]Where's he at?
[08:33.89]Oh, what?
[08:40.68]Ow, I'm dead.
[08:42.30]You scatter arrow.
[08:43.36]More funny moments.
[08:44.58]I'm trying to, like, cool off right now from being annoyed.
[08:47.56]Oh, what do I even do here?
[08:56.91]I don't know.
[08:58.13]I'm so...
[09:01.26]Like I had so many PSVR games I was going to download.
[09:03.92]I had Red Dead Redemption.
[09:05.20]I had like three Steam games I was going to play.
[09:08.88]And it all got thrown into the toilet.
[09:11.46]Because Phil Spencer is a fucking shithead.
[09:19.63]This whole stream got thrown into the trash can.
[09:22.77]Because Microsoft is so concerned about their fucking DRM.
[09:26.88]They don't give a fuck about anything else.
[09:28.72]Let me be honest with you.
[09:29.56]Let's be real.
[09:33.74]Are you sure you own this game that you just bought?
[09:35.98]It's a fucking game from like 10 years ago.
[09:41.80]Do you really give a shit?
[09:43.52]Like, give me a break.
[09:49.62]I gotta turn the sensitivity way down on this, by the way.
[09:57.49]Ow.
[10:02.29]The sensitivity is so high.
[10:11.07]Is Vinny surprised?
[10:11.89]Yeah, well at least like Vinny got to show up during the train wreck stream.
[10:18.56]All these fucking developers are so concerned about like, we gotta make sure that somebody actually bought it legally.
[10:26.24]Shove a fucking stick up your ass.
[10:28.49]Like, seriously.
[10:29.41]Fuck you.
[10:33.19]You're a company.
[10:33.67]You make fucking like a hundred billion dollars a year.
[10:36.17]Like, shut up.
[10:36.81]Give me a break.
[10:40.96]You wonder why people like pirate games.
[10:43.50]Like, really.
[10:45.96]If I'm gonna be fucking totally real and honest.
[10:48.74]Like, why do you think people want to pirate your fucking shitty games?
[10:55.74]Don't know you could have gotten this from some you're not logged into the cloud But you're not logged into the cloud sir You sure you understand you're not logged into the fucking Microsoft OneDrive cloud You have to do that to activate your fucking serial key Yeah, well guess what a storms coming
[11:25.18]Remember when you could just buy a fucking video game?
[11:27.10]Remember how fucking fun that was?
[11:31.54]When you could buy a video game and use it?
[11:43.09]Let it snow.
[11:46.40]I'm gonna die.
[11:55.13]Buying a game in 2017.
[11:55.93]This is another thing I wanted to bring up.
[11:59.84]So why is it?
[12:01.86]So it told me you don't have a credit card on file.
[12:04.94]Who cares?
[12:07.38]Can I not just buy the game with my credit card?
[12:11.52]Well, sorry, sir.
[12:12.28]You don't have a credit card linked up to the cloud on file.
[12:15.06]You can't buy this game.
[12:17.56]Can I just... Can I just buy the game?
[12:21.14]Why can't I just buy the game?
[12:28.95]Let me just buy it.
[12:36.08]He's become a bit stream.
[12:37.68]No.
[12:41.90]Oh, spy somewhere.
[12:48.55]Where?
[12:49.67]Bullshit, I don't believe it.
[12:56.36]I need to reload this.
[12:58.31]That's for sure.
[13:03.89]Going back to 2013.
[13:08.41]You cannot make a simple purchase without registering personal information you normally don't need.
[13:12.04]I just don't... I don't understand.
[13:15.44]Like, I see it, like, more and more often.
[13:17.10]It's like, why do we have... Why do you need to, like, have, like, all this shit for me to just play a game that I bought?
[13:26.29]Like, I bought a code from Amazon, right?
[13:29.09]It's, like, the very end of that whole thing.
[13:33.26]Did they reduce the amount of, like, grenades I have?
[13:39.48]Oh, fucking fine.
[13:40.30]I'll just hit you in the face.
[13:41.08]I need to hug Jerma.
[13:51.13]But it is, like, frustrating.
[13:52.87]It is.
[13:57.15]At the very core, like, I want to, like, do the things that I want to do on stream, right?
[14:04.87]And sometimes... Sometimes it doesn't go right.
[14:09.56]And it fucking irritates me.
[14:11.24]It does.
[14:11.56]Oh, sniper.
[14:30.16]Upgrade to the gold package.
[14:35.26]But I just don't understand the issue.
[14:37.56]I don't.
[14:39.10]Because... So I wanted to play Red Dead.
[14:43.11]And I'm going to buy Red Dead.
[14:44.31]I want to go buy Red Dead.
[14:46.33]Microsoft did not allow me to purchase Red Dead because they said I didn't have a valid credit card on file.
[14:53.73]Two different credit cards that absolutely have money on them.
[14:57.19]Trust me, they do.
[14:58.87]were put into this system.
[15:00.85]I had to go into Microsoft's fucking live account bullshit and do it.
[15:06.72]They still don't exist.
[15:08.18]I buy it!
[15:08.88]I go buy the game from Amazon, like a digital, like from, not like from some random fat fucking slob that has like codes in his fucking basement, like buried under a fucking suitcase.
[15:19.32]No, I'm talking about like Amazon, like Amazon Digital Services sold me this card.
[15:26.14]And it didn't work.
[15:27.37]Microsoft was concerned of where I fucking got the code.
[15:30.95]On a 10 year old fucking game.
[15:37.43]That's fucking stupid.
[15:39.82]Maybe if I keep talking about the problem itself.
[15:41.82]But it's irritating.
[15:42.66]It is.
[15:46.78]I know I'm being a broken record.
[15:48.84]But it's true.
[15:49.96]It's fucking obnoxious.
[15:58.37]I leveled up.
[16:07.34]If it's a bug with your account, share your credit card information.
[16:13.20]It's just a bug.
[16:14.30]I'm going to share my credit card info with you.
[16:16.12]So what do you get for leveling up?
[16:27.59]Well, what's gonna happen is I'm just gonna go get Red Dead Redemption, like the physical copy, even though I tried to.
[16:32.55]And if you were here an hour, two hours ago, you know.
[16:41.26]All I can say is I'm sorry.
[16:42.56]Because I hate when shit like this happens, I do.
[16:48.31]So obviously it's not my intention.
[16:52.71]What do I got?
[16:53.21]Purple range.
[16:53.71]I have like a factory new, don't I?
[16:56.34]Where's my factory?
[16:57.14]There it is.
[16:57.78]60 seconds.
[17:08.93]I got three purple ranges.
[17:16.51]I'm rich.
[17:21.22]I did get this in a video, I think.
[17:23.98]Long time ago.
[17:34.82]Contracts still work.
[17:36.14]Is it like still a thing?
[17:47.31]I was mad in that video too.
[17:51.31]I probably was.
[17:52.17]Whoa, that was a guy.
[17:58.47]Are you sure you own that weapon skin?
[18:01.77]I might not.
[18:12.52]Alright, let's do it.
[18:13.88]Let's get some kills.
[18:23.69]Can I pull it off?
[18:28.14]Every headshot, I need a confirmation number.
[18:30.80]Wouldn't that be something?
[18:40.03]We missed you, Jerma.
[18:42.41]I never left.
[18:44.21]Wait.
[18:44.59]View model.
[18:45.36]How do I do this?
[18:51.26]Hold on.
[18:52.36]View model FOV.
[18:58.44]There you go.
[18:58.80]That's better.
[19:00.41]Whoops.
[19:02.33]That's better.
[19:06.23]I can't see chat shit.
[19:11.90]I never left, but I never was here.
[19:14.76]Weird lineup.
[19:19.30]Let's see if my muscle memory still exists.
[19:23.06]What do you guys think?
[19:36.27]Well, that's an over.
[19:51.14]Shit.
[19:53.83]Oh, if I didn't get fucking... If I didn't get burnt, I would have hit him.
[20:02.95]Didn't do shit.
[20:03.61]Is that a real gamer?
[20:11.09]No.
[20:12.82]Not at all.
[20:15.12]Sensitivity might not be correct, but whatever.
[20:19.49]What is this stream?
[20:20.81]Good question.
[20:22.79]It's a Jerma is angry because things didn't go his way.
[20:25.93]What a baby stream.
[20:28.23]That's pretty much what it's been for like two plus hours.
[20:43.48]Who's on it?
[20:55.59]Ow.
[20:56.09]Ow.
[20:56.23]Do I have medicine?
[20:57.71]Do I have medicine?
[20:58.77]What do you mean?
[20:59.81]Medicine.
[21:00.29]Yeah, thank you.
[21:12.01]Oh, the sensitivity's not right.
[21:13.22]It's not right.
[21:14.44]It isn't right.
[21:18.42]It's not correct.
[21:19.10]I have to change it.
[21:19.84]I don't know.
[21:20.22]Hold on.
[21:20.98]I gotta go back to raw input.
[21:30.90]Maybe that's better.
[21:34.38]Maybe.
[21:34.78]I'm not sure.
[21:35.21]Yeah, it is.
[21:44.63]Shit!
[21:50.01]No!
[21:52.66]Do I have a secondary?
[21:56.80]Why do I have the Razorback on?
[21:59.60]What the fuck am I using this for?
[22:00.72]Playing model in the corner isn't updating.
[22:10.65]I'll see you later.
[22:11.23]If you're leaving, I'm sorry the stream was a fucking disaster.
[22:14.17]Hopefully you thought it was funny.
[22:21.54]I'm trying to wind down.
[22:22.82]That's what I'm doing.
[22:29.99]You guys know I care.
[22:32.06]That's pretty much all I need to say.
[22:41.88]Whoa!
[22:43.24]Lots of people.
[22:52.86]Where's that scout?
[22:57.00]Shit.
[22:59.69]Shit!
[23:03.60]Fuck you!
[23:04.42]No!
[23:05.60]Don't do it!
[23:09.94]Don't do it!
[23:14.66]Ah!
[23:15.86]Nah, I don't got it!
[23:17.06]I don't got it!
[23:17.82]I see he doesn't got it anymore!
[23:19.22]He still don't got it!
[23:23.46]What?
[23:23.70]How am I not?
[23:25.24]What?
[23:26.52]Come on, I wanna hit the engineer!
[23:37.78]Oh, Lord.
[23:38.34]Oh, maybe I'll play Spy and just fuck around.
[23:47.07]I beat Dark Souls 3.
[23:58.56]I did.
[23:58.92]I did beat that game.
[24:00.34]And, you know, a fast weapon.
[24:03.40]I'm going to strangle myself in a second.
[24:09.42]Where is it?
[24:10.62]Where is it?
[24:14.50]Motherfucker.
[24:22.31]What does it change?
[24:23.03]I don't even know.
[24:24.47]I guess my name's Trevor.
[24:25.65]I fucking used to play this game.
[24:28.17]I don't know.
[24:28.90]What did I do?
[24:29.24]That's a funny joke.
[24:55.85]New disguise.
[24:58.45]God.
[24:58.79]I'm going to have to end it here shortly.
[25:06.95]I'm just not in a mindset to stream.
[25:08.49]I'm really not.
[25:10.13]I wish I was telling you a lie, but I'm not lying to you.
[25:22.08]This has just been a disaster for seven hours.
[25:26.82]I'm so fucking sorry.
[25:29.07]Whoa, humans!
[25:31.25]There are people there.
[25:49.55]I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[25:51.43]By the way.
[25:52.15]Or actually Sunday.
[25:53.07]I'm going to stream Sunday.
[25:55.25]And we're actually going to play Red Dead.
[25:56.49]Like the actual fucking game.
[25:59.63]I don't care what it takes.
[26:01.11]We're streaming Sunday at 7.
[26:02.16]And we're going to play Red Dead.
[26:05.96]I ain't fucking doing this shit.
[26:13.20]I'm going to go get like a physical copy of it.
[26:14.92]And we're going to play it.
[26:20.36]before I put a hole through my fucking computer.
[26:27.87]Oh, I missed you.
[26:28.91]You did.
[26:35.09]I got the guy in his tummy.
[26:36.78]And his name was Tummy, too.
[26:37.90]That's how you know it counts.
[26:56.09]A lot of Pyros.
[27:00.69]I heard a... Somebody up there?
[27:12.78]Do I hear somebody up there?
[27:22.67]They're all dead.
[27:30.05]Let's try to get somebody as they come up.
[27:33.71]Like this guy, who's an obvious spy.
[27:36.09]Nope, didn't get him.
[27:37.98]No, I didn't get the guy standing still.
[27:40.94]It's alright.
[27:41.72]At least I tried.
[27:42.60]Come on, just instant kill.
[28:06.41]Oh no, they're gonna get their control point.
[28:12.56]We lose.
[28:22.16]I haven't seen sniping this bad since I played Sniper.
[28:33.05]It wasn't supposed to be like this.
[28:35.79]I gotta go.
[28:37.71]I do.
[28:38.33]I'm just not.
[28:39.16]I'm like fucking Debbie Downer right now.
[28:41.04]I tried.
[28:45.68]What's the item?
[28:46.35]What did I get?
[28:46.83]I don't know.
[28:47.53]Fucking rainy day.
[28:48.25]Open it.
[29:10.60]Well, uh, thanks for coming out.
[29:12.59]I hope you enjoyed yourself.
[29:16.13]Rainy day.
[29:17.93]Rainy day.
[29:21.17]Words can't describe how angry I am.
[29:25.34]I am fucking furious right now.
[29:28.20]Because there's so many things I had ready to go, but they weren't ready.
[29:42.57]Have a good night.
[29:46.86]And by the way, my computer fucking blue screens like two or three times.
[29:54.12]How does that fucking happen to me?
[29:58.97]I'm not going to do a pity party.
[30:00.01]I'm not.
[30:00.57]I'm just... I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[30:04.47]We're going to actually play Red Dead on Sunday.
[30:07.41]Because I'm going to get like a non-DRM fucking destroyed version of Red Dead Redemption.
[30:14.83]Fuck me.
[30:15.53]Like, really.
[30:20.11]See you on Sunday.
[30:32.99]How long have I been streaming?
[30:33.83]Like, three hours or something?
[30:34.95]Like, not even.
[30:38.99]You deserve better than this.
[30:41.69]You do.
[30:46.13]Anyways.
[30:46.57]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[30:53.32]Sunday at 7 o'clock.
[30:55.42]We're actually gonna fucking play a goddamn game.
[31:00.09]We're not gonna jump around.
[31:08.16]But, Gummy Monk, thanks for the $5 earlier.
[31:11.38]Mad Band, thank you as well.
[31:13.70]Go listen to some music or something and don't forget to try Mountain Blade.
[31:16.22]I will.
[31:19.96]Solair, thanks for the $15.
[31:20.86]Shpee is happy.
[31:24.05]Shpees are always happy.
[31:27.11]Smugster and Fluffy McCree, thanks for the bits.
[31:29.83]I don't have a lot of money and sorry that the rough time you're having, but I want you to know that I enjoy your streams.
[31:34.37]I hope so.
[31:37.95]When things go wrong like this that I can't control, it puts me in a bad mood.
[31:45.60]So, hopefully things get worked out and I can actually play the fucking game on Sunday.
[31:51.54]Siden, thanks for the $5 earlier.

[32:04.59]But thank you for the five bucks.
[32:06.59]Neogor, thanks for the bits.
[32:08.51]Just got some wisdom tooth done.
[32:09.87]This is really helping pass the time.
[32:11.25]Thanks for doing what you do.
[32:12.73]Well, thanks for sticking around, dude.
[32:15.57]Much appreciated.
[32:17.83]The Adventurer, thanks for the four dollars.
[32:19.97]You're losing it.

[32:21.58]I'm losing it on stream.
[32:24.22]It did happen.
[32:27.70]Greenland, thanks for the five bucks.
[32:30.46]Kuzon, thanks for the ten bucks.
[32:35.07]I never laugh as hard as I do when I watch your streams.
[32:38.55]I'm glad.
[32:39.23]I'm fucking glad that you're happy.
[32:40.71]I'm glad you think it's fun.
[32:44.28]Thanks for the $10.

[32:52.28]You give a dollar again.
[32:53.08]You must have good dental.
[32:56.60]Awesome Alec and Rascal, thank you for the bits.
[32:59.00]Thank you for $2 and $5 respectively.
[33:00.69]Can you zoom in on your beautiful eyes?
[33:02.23]Here you go.
[33:04.89]You want it, you got it.
[33:09.73]Get it.
[33:12.65]Like sweaty fucking forehead.
[33:14.09]There you go.
[33:24.06]Oh fuck, I was supposed to- I was supposed to hit the fucking- Hold on.
[33:27.38]Wait, I'll do it again.
[33:32.72]No, I fucked it up again.
[33:33.56]Wait.
[33:38.52]Man, that's better.
[33:42.07]But thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[33:43.89]There was a lot of people here tonight, and, like, you just got a shitty stream, and I'm sorry.
[33:49.11]See you guys on Sunday, 7 o'clock.
[33:50.79]Much love.
