[00:08.42]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.08]Jerma here with Scrolls.
[00:12.40]This is a brand new game.
[00:13.68]It came out today.
[00:15.16]Well, actually, it's not really released yet.
[00:17.28]It came into open beta today.
[00:18.83]And it's the new game by Mojang.
[00:21.27]You guys might know that name.
[00:22.61]It's the guys that made Minecraft.
[00:24.65]This is their second real release of a game that took a lot of studio time that they're currently in active development with.
[00:32.03]And I've been having a ton of fun with it today.
[00:34.01]It's 20 bucks.
[00:36.35]And it's not on Steam or anything like that, as of right now.
[00:39.15]It's only on the Mojang store.
[00:41.60]If you just go to scrolls.com, you'll be able to find it.
[00:44.44]But essentially, what this game is, it's a combination of a bunch of different things.
[00:48.54]And it's the reason why these few things are combined, is why the game is so much fun.
[00:53.03]So let's start very basically.
[00:54.87]The game is a strategy game.
[00:56.33]It's like a tile strategy game.
[00:58.53]along the lines of Magic the Gathering, where you have cards, you have to tap resources, with the ultimate goal of destroying the five totems or idols on the side of the map that you do not own.
[01:12.59]So, the gameplay is very difficult to break down in a very short, like, four or five minute commentary, but it reminds me of, if you guys have ever played Heroes of Might and Magic, the same type of strategy tile movement in that game, and the different attack damages that people have, the different life pools that people have.
[01:32.77]If you were a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic,
[01:35.87]you will probably like this game, because unlike Heroes of Might and Magic, there is no open world system.
[01:44.17]You just attack people with the monsters that you have in your deck, kind of like Pok√©mon.
[01:49.52]You go against people, you train against people, and there's a ranked system as well.
[01:53.60]You'll be fighting people and trying to get higher on the rank system.
[01:56.92]You can trade cards with people and...
[02:00.04]Before I completely blow your mind here, I want you to sit down, relax for a second, take a deep breath, and listen to the words I'm about to say.
[02:10.51]There is an uncrating system in this game.
[02:14.17]Oh my god!
[02:15.35]Calm down, calm down, it's okay, just calm down.
[02:17.95]What do you mean there's an uncrating system, what is that?
[02:19.98]I'm gonna tell you, just chill out for a second.
[02:23.89]how you get cards in this game is through the uncrating system you make money by completing challenges by beating other players and by just playing the game you earn gold as a currency and what that allows you to do is it allows you to essentially unbox a crate for a hundred gold to get a random card now the random card could be
[02:47.94]A common card, just a crappy kind of regular card that you already have.
[02:51.66]It could be a rare card or an uncommon card.
[02:54.98]So, just the collection aspect of this game and the opening up the scrolls and seeing what you got.
[03:01.67]Because remember, every card in this game has either a spell property, an enhancement property, an enchantment property, it's a creature, it's an actual monster.
[03:11.10]So there's a ton of different things you could possibly, quote, unbox in the game.
[03:15.84]and it makes building your decks that much more fun.
[03:19.48]And I really don't know what it is about these games we play, like TF2, this game, there's a couple others that have the same mechanic.
[03:26.05]Unboxing something and not knowing what's inside of it, it could be something terrible, it could be something really good, it could be something incredibly good.
[03:35.24]That's such a drive.
[03:36.40]I felt the same thing when I was playing Diablo II, and you'd kill Bale or Mephisto and be like, what's it gonna drop?
[03:42.42]What's it gonna drop?
[03:43.20]Oh, he dropped nothing.
[03:44.24]Or, oh my god, he dropped a grandfather sword.
[03:47.19]All that stuff is the reason why it drives you to play these games.
[03:51.63]And I feel like Mojang, Mojang, however you want to pronounce it, however it's actually pronounced, I think they're doing a really cool thing here, where they're molding these genres together and they're making a skill ceiling that's very high.
[04:01.49]Because I was playing earlier...
[04:04.05]In just a quick match.
[04:04.87]Remember, the game came into open beta today.
[04:07.59]And I just got absolutely smoked by the first guy I played.
[04:10.60]He, like, knew exactly what he was doing.
[04:12.94]He had a good deck.
[04:14.24]He'd probably unboxed a bunch of cards and had a cool, like, synergy going between his cards.
[04:19.06]And it got me going, I want to do that.
[04:21.78]I want to be as good as this guy.
[04:22.90]I want to build a good deck.
[04:24.24]I want to get good cards.
[04:25.80]And it takes hold of you.
[04:27.14]It really does.
[04:27.86]And I highly recommend you give this game a try if you're into this kind of thing.
[04:31.70]If you are not...
[04:33.82]into this type of game where it's very slow-paced, turn-based, strategy-type card collection game.
[04:40.91]I would say you probably should avoid this title, because there's not a huge amount of action.
[04:46.77]It's not like bombs are dropping down and like arrows are flying across the screen and stuff.
[04:51.28]I mean, the animations are very fluid, they're very interesting, they're cute to look at, but I would say action-wise,
[04:58.20]You should probably avoid this game if you're not into, like, the turn-based strategy type game.
[05:02.45]But if you are, and you love collecting things, and you love opening crates in TF2, then you probably would have really enjoyed this game.
[05:12.19]And I gotta give two thumbs up.
[05:13.67]to this title so far I haven't really run into any major issues with the game I mean the only issue I have so far and it might be because I'm just pretty inexperienced at this point right now but the game can be very difficult especially even on the easy setting
[05:30.16]I've been getting destroyed by some things, and I'm getting better very slowly, so I'm not going to say that the difficulty is too high at this point, but it's very difficult.
[05:40.11]You have to invest some time to study the decks, know what cards do, what they actually mean when you put them down, and so on and so forth.
[05:47.79]But I'm going to end the video there, guys.
[05:48.89]Just wanted to give you a heads up that this game is now in open beta.
[05:51.87]You can go get it.
[05:52.99]The only way you can get into the open beta is you have to buy it, so there is no...
[05:57.67]Free open beta.
[05:58.60]You actually have to purchase the game.
[06:00.18]But I'm gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[06:01.54]Thank you all so much for watching.
[06:02.80]I really do appreciate it.
[06:03.94]And go check out Skrulls, baby.
[06:06.14]I'll see you all next time.
[06:07.35]Take care, everybody.
