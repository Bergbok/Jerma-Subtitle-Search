[00:08.82]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.50]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.17]And tonight, gonna be playing as a bunch of different people.
[00:17.79]I think it's the Demoman, the Soldier, and the Scout.
[00:21.09]I believe I could be wrong.
[00:22.79]I don't know how I edited this together.
[00:24.97]But it's okay, because I'm not really going to be talking about the gameplay all that much.
[00:28.97]I'm going to be talking about Team Fortress 2, and specifically... Well, first of all, this is a 100% crit gameplay.
[00:36.26]Not meant to be taken all that seriously.
[00:39.10]And that's the point of this whole video.
[00:40.68]TF2...
[00:42.50]is not a very serious game.
[00:43.86]I mean, there are of course the competitive aspects of this game, there are the very hunker down, focus, get a bunch of kills as whatever your favorite class is, but this game is meant, at least for me, primarily for the humor and the hilarity of every single moment.
[00:59.75]There's at least one or two moments per round that I laugh at the screen for, like,
[01:05.08]A heavy, like eating a sandwich and then getting backstabbed while the spy then goes on to the point and gets hit in the face by a frying pan.
[01:12.09]Like, these things happen all the time in this game.
[01:15.53]And I really do truly think that this is sort of where I'm taking this video.
[01:19.41]If Team Fortress 2 did not have the humor, where would it be?
[01:24.40]Would it just fall into forgotten memories or would we ever play this game that much anymore?
[01:29.16]If the spy didn't have revenge kill lines, if there were no fully voice acted characters, there were no meet the team videos, if this was just a first person shooter and nothing else in a phong shaded world, would we still be playing right now at this point?
[01:46.88]I don't think so.
[01:48.14]I don't think I would still be playing.
[01:49.84]If Team Fortress went with the original design for Team Fortress 2, which was a more serious guys in camo outfits with rifles and stuff, if that really was what it was, and there was no character, there was no humor, there was no ridiculous moments, I probably would have played it for a couple years maybe, and then I would have probably moved on to something else.
[02:10.74]Now, I'm not sure if that's because I really love cartoons.
[02:13.84]I love animation.
[02:15.07]I love the voice acting behind different characters.
[02:17.15]I love when people are brought to life and they don't really exist anywhere else and there's a whole lot of comedy.
[02:21.71]I love Cartoon Network, all the, you know, Adult Swim shows.
[02:25.15]I love that stuff.
[02:26.45]So not having it...
[02:28.65]really just go, it's like, meh, this game was fun for a while, but, you know, whatever, I'm done with it.
[02:34.40]What else is it?
[02:35.10]What time is it?
[02:35.72]Can I, like, do something else?
[02:37.12]I would say the same thing about the Grand Theft Auto series.
[02:39.76]There's a reason why the GTA series...
[02:43.49]does so well, and performs so well, and gets such high ratings, and has such a huge replayability factor.
[02:50.01]It's because the game is batshit crazy.
[02:52.61]Like, you can do the most ridiculous things in that game.
[02:55.42]It's not meant to be taken that seriously, unless you're playing, obviously, the campaign, but even the campaign does not take itself seriously.
[03:03.26]People blow across the screen in cars, and the cops, like, fly off buildings and stuff.
[03:07.98]It's insanity, and that's the reason why I keep going back and playing that game.
[03:12.65]But I want to hear what you guys have to say about this.
[03:15.55]What do you think is your favorite crazy moments, in quotes, game?
[03:19.84]Is it something like Team Fortress?
[03:21.04]Like, what's the craziest, what's the craziest, most hilarious thing you've ever seen in Team Fortress 2?
[03:26.85]We'll start with that.
[03:28.55]So, I guess I'll go first, because obviously there's nobody else in this room, so I guess I'll go first.
[03:34.44]So anyways, my favorite Most Hilarious Team Fortress 2 moment is something that I recorded, and it unfortunately got deleted.
[03:42.52]I was going to show it, because I wanted to talk about this, and I was going to show it right freaking now, but it is no longer in existence.
[03:49.38]What happened was, I was playing as the spy,
[03:51.88]And I was completely tryharding.
[03:53.50]I was trying to get a gameplay, backstabbing people, pulling out the revolver, bang, bang, bang, getting a couple kills, go after this guy, cloak, get behind him.
[03:59.51]I was trying to get a gameplay, and I ended up turning a corner.
[04:02.79]This was on Viaduct, right where one of the buildings are on the enemy team's side.
[04:06.67]I was in the building, and I walked around the corner, and there was a sniper there.
[04:10.18]The sniper saw me, he knew I was a spy, and we started dancing.
[04:13.50]He started to try a quickscope on me, he tried to then come in with the melee, back up, like I was trying to shoot him with the revolver, and then we just stopped.
[04:20.86]And then he crouched, and I crouched, and we walked into each other while we were still crouching, I kept on calling him a spy, he kept on saying yes over and over again, and for about 45 seconds to 2 minutes, I don't even know what the exact time was, we were just sitting there doing that.
[04:36.31]And the whole time, this is on Viaduct, there were just, there was shit going on all around us.
[04:40.47]A pyro, an enemy pyro actually came over and looked at us, and then walked away.
[04:45.79]Like, he didn't want to interfere with our, like, weird tea party moment we were having.
[04:49.77]And that's... I was cracking up so hard, and I'm so mad that I didn't have it recorded, because I was gonna put it right here.
[04:56.62]It was hysterical.
[04:57.50]Like, why did that happen?
[04:58.82]You can't do that in Call of Duty.
[05:01.16]You can't do that in Battlefield.
[05:02.81]You can't do that in any other game besides the hilarious Team Fortress 2.
[05:09.24]And with that, that's gonna wrap up the video, guys.
[05:11.49]So in the comment section, again, please, if you can remember, leave me what you think your funniest Team Fortress 2 moment has been thus far.
[05:19.75]And thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[05:20.95]I really do appreciate it.
[05:22.21]And I'll talk to you all next time.
[05:23.41]And of course, take care, everybody.
