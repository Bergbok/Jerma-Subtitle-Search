[00:05.06]Hi.
[00:06.46]My name is Mr. Giraffe.
[00:22.37]The herd.
[00:23.43]Let's go.
[00:24.07]I can't.
[00:27.17]I'm like up to the elephant's ass.
[00:29.17]You're going to change the view a lot.
[00:31.53]Let's go find somebody to rough him up.
[00:36.89]Let's go rough somebody up.
[00:38.50]Elephant style.
[00:40.60]This guy.
[00:42.56]This guy.
[00:43.72]Get him.
[00:50.46]We can't hit him.
[00:51.98]We don't know where my body is.
[00:54.34]We got him.
[00:55.52]We eat the flesh just like elephant do.
[00:58.78]Yes.
[01:01.51]You hear the one about the two elephants?
[01:03.31]Get in.
[01:05.53]You're doing the dancing.
[01:25.26]There is seriously no, I'd love to make a couple of jokes or something, but this is like there's nothing that can be said.
[01:34.29]This elephant dance is just perfect.
[01:36.95]He just leans over, taps his foot.
[01:41.36]Hold on a second.
[01:41.90]What is this going to look like?
[01:44.24]Get on this bike.
[01:50.12]It's like they dropped like a dead elephant on a bike.
[01:52.64]Alright, let's go.
[01:54.71]His butt's so crunched up.
[01:56.33]Let's go.
[01:57.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:58.85]I gotta... Oh, you're the giraffe now?
[02:08.67]We're zoo pals.
[02:10.19]Zoo pals make eating fun.
[02:12.07]Oh, zoo pals.
[02:15.37]You just disappeared.
[02:18.10]I love zoo pouch.
[02:18.88]I love animal crackers.
[02:23.00]The elephants didn't want anything to do with it.
[02:25.50]What the fuck?
[02:32.32]Okay.
[02:33.70]So, oh, look at this one coming down the street.
[02:38.18]He's going pretty fast.
[02:44.16]Oh, I wish he drove through this whole crowd.
[02:46.30]Oh, shit.
[02:51.06]Why?
[02:51.94]Why are they such psychos?
[02:56.02]Why aren't these elephants doing anything?
[02:57.70]I don't know.
[02:58.16]Oh, they'll be back.
[03:04.69]No.
[03:05.83]No.
[03:06.87]No, get in the...
[03:16.40]Later.
[03:16.76]Alright, I got this elephant.
[03:20.74]I'm tracking down an elephant.
[03:24.92]Elephant on a bike.
[03:29.11]He's going pretty, pretty goddamn fast.
[03:35.13]Here he goes, do you see him?
[03:36.37]Yeah.
[03:37.37]Oh, you're getting the chase on the elephant.
[03:41.18]Oh, I don't want to go that fast.
[03:44.24]Wow.
[03:46.01]He really is.
[03:46.95]He's flooring it.
[03:48.81]How is he weaving out of traffic that well?
[03:50.81]Apparently not that well.
[03:54.51]He's alright.
[03:55.11]He got back on track.
[04:02.85]Where did he come from?
[04:06.05]He just came out of the fence.
[04:08.43]He's more interesting.
[04:09.49]The elephant's gone now.
[04:10.95]This guy's way more interesting.
[04:21.80]Get him.
[04:22.64]Get him.
[04:23.14]Kick his ass.
[04:23.48]They all want this one truck.
[04:27.22]Who's gonna win?
[04:32.79]They're all just fighting over the same car.
[04:34.59]They really are.
[04:36.19]There's other cars, you idiots.
[04:37.97]I'm trying to push it to like get one of them out of here.
[04:44.09]As soon as they get thrown out of the car too, it's like they don't want to drive anymore.
[04:48.25]Yeah, they're like, whoever's the last person that gets in is the one that's driving.
[04:54.14]Maybe not, I don't know.
[05:02.67]One out of the herd.
[05:05.86]What the fuck are you doing?
[05:07.72]You dicks.
[05:12.27]What is up with these psychos?
[05:37.61]Somebody cut it in half!
[05:42.29]He's in!
[05:43.51]He's in!
[05:45.87]The winner!
[05:48.23]Do you see how beat up the truck is?
[05:54.23]Fuck!
[05:55.11]I'm passing out!
[05:56.17]Hold on!
[05:56.57]Get in!
[05:57.31]I can't!
[05:58.03]I can't breathe!
[05:58.61]Get in!
[05:59.63]I can't!
[06:01.83]I'm so confused in this city.
[06:03.61]Oh, that's a 10-4.
[06:09.38]Bye!
[06:09.84]Where are you going?
[06:13.30]I just- I just tried to fart.
[06:19.72]Can you breathe?
[06:37.56]I think my game broke.
[06:44.59]Yeah, you didn't respawn.
[06:46.63]What was the movie?
[06:48.37]Dumbo Drop?
