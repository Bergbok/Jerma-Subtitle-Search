[00:00.85]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:02.62]Jerma here with an update video.
[00:05.76]I felt the need to make this video because of various developments going on in my channel and my life.
[00:11.24]So we're going to talk.
[00:12.68]I don't have any gameplay.
[00:14.14]I haven't recorded much gameplay since like four or five months ago.
[00:17.54]So in the background of this video is probably just going to be Spider-Man.
[00:22.44]You cool with that?
[00:24.49]You don't want Spider-Man?
[00:26.41]Okay, but how about Spider-Man 2?
[00:29.16]Yeah, I knew I'd get you with the Spider-Man 2.
[00:32.03]So if you want to listen, you go ahead, and if you don't, then you've probably already left, and I don't know why I'm even addressing that person, because they've been gone for probably the last 10 to 15 seconds.
[00:41.51]So, I will address the elephant in the room, which is my uploads over the last couple of months.
[00:48.57]I'm sure you're well aware there's only been like three uploads to this channel in two months, and that's something that I'm not particularly happy about.
[00:56.02]I obviously want to make as many videos, make as many...
[00:59.73]videos that I'm proud of, that I want you guys to watch, try to get as much videos and content up as possible, but sometimes, sometimes you need to collect yourself, take a break, and reiterate inside your head why you do these things, why you make these videos, what you're doing it for, who you're doing it for, and are you still interested?
[01:20.25]And that's a very important point that I want to make.
[01:22.39]Very, very first off, before we talk about anything else, I have to stay interested.
[01:28.39]We could talk about money and power and the fame and the fans and how... Kiss my hand.
[01:35.78]Now kneel.
[01:36.32]I don't... No, I just... I need to stay interested.
[01:40.50]I have to be completely and totally into the thing that I'm currently working on.
[01:45.13]I've never been able to just force myself to upload something.
[01:49.67]Even back when I was uploading a shitload of videos years ago, I was totally fucking into it.
[01:55.10]I was so into making those videos every day because I was currently so into the subject matter.
[02:00.46]And lately, I've been into certain subject matters that take way more time to come up with and way more time to produce.
[02:08.28]Which we can segue into talking about the next subject I want to bring up.
[02:12.83]And it's a huge video that I've been working on.
[02:16.85]I've wanted to make this video for about a year.
[02:19.41]And it's currently taking up a bunch of my mental energy and spare time and money and effort.
[02:25.78]It's going to be huge.
[02:27.04]And it's going to come out this summer.
[02:28.84]I don't want to talk about what it is I'm sure people can piece together the stupid things I've said on live streams to be able to piece together what it is and I've told some people what it is just if I if I told you if you're one of the people I've told just you know just keep zipping you know what I mean just keep it up
[02:44.33]You're Secret Keeper now.
[02:45.87]You've been elevated to the status of Secret Keeper.
[02:48.27]That doesn't happen very often, especially in my circle of acolytes that I have here.
[02:53.49]So, if I've told you, just, you know what to do.
[02:56.54]So, stay tuned for that.
[02:57.90]It's coming.
[02:58.58]You'll see it when you see it, and I really hope you guys enjoy it, because it is a legit, just like, love letter to you guys.
[03:06.88]And without getting overly sappy or emotional in this video,
[03:10.80]It's for you.
[03:12.36]This video is for you.
[03:13.73]I've had this idea.
[03:15.75]that I thought people would really, really be into, and it's just a total concentration of all the stupid shit that's been going on in this channel for five years.
[03:25.08]And I hope you guys really enjoy it when you see it.
[03:28.22]And that's pretty much all I gotta say about that subject.
[03:30.22]I'm gonna move on to the next one, which is streaming.
[03:32.74]Which I gotta be careful of, because every single time I talk about streaming in a video, I curse myself and I don't stream for like three months.
[03:41.55]So let's hope that doesn't happen right now because I've been streaming a lot lately.
[03:44.81]These last like four months I've been going a couple times a week, sometimes more than that, sometimes like four, five, six, seven, eight hour streams.
[03:52.24]I streamed all of Dark Souls 3, I streamed a bunch of Stardew Valley, I did Doom a couple days ago, I've been streaming Overwatch a shitload.
[04:01.28]I've been on there a lot and it's something that I'm having a ton of fun doing.
[04:04.24]So if you still have not followed my Twitch and you're into that and you like streaming, then come on over.
[04:12.57]And if you're not, if you really just hate live streaming, you don't like watching live streams, then there is a little bit of good news here for you too, because all the streams that I do, at least the major ones that have a substantial amount of content in them, will be broken up and they will be uploaded as highlights to YouTube.
[04:30.99]Now, I don't know if that's going to be this channel, or if I'd make a separate channel entirely for stream content.
[04:37.01]I don't know, but I don't like the idea of putting whole streams up on YouTube, because they are currently on Twitch right now.
[04:43.39]You can watch entire VODs on Twitch right now.
[04:47.07]So I don't want to do that.
[04:48.21]I'd rather have, oh, you played through Dark Souls 3?
[04:51.63]Here's like two or three videos condensed of all the best moments from when you were streaming.
[04:56.57]That's what I'm into.
[04:57.93]I'm just not sure exactly when it will happen, but I would assume in the next couple months here is when it would start to be a thing.
[05:05.08]And finally, we're going to talk about my book.
[05:08.55]That's right.
[05:09.67]You didn't think you were going to ever hear that shit again, did you?
[05:11.79]About my book that I'm writing.
[05:13.82]If you have no idea what I'm talking about, if you're fairly new to the channel, or if you're an old subscriber that forgot because it's been so damn long, I wanted to try to make a choose-your-own-adventure book, write it, and come up with some stupid ideas, put it in like a medieval fantasy world, and you get to pick different things to do, and it was going to be free.
[05:32.02]I was never going to charge for it.
[05:33.28]I was going to just release it because I'm using the Inkle Writer to write it.
[05:36.98]And there's been progress.
[05:38.51]I actually started writing again.
[05:40.23]I stopped, and I started, and I stopped, and I started, and now I'm finally writing again.
[05:43.09]And it's become kind of like therapy to me.
[05:46.59]You know, when I'm like, fucking today sucks.
[05:48.61]You know what, I'm just going to sit down, and I'm going to write like two chapters.
[05:52.21]And I don't know.
[05:53.49]We'll see what happens.
[05:54.43]I have no idea if this is ever going to get finished.
[05:57.20]Another like 6 to 12 months might go by and I might just throw it up onto Twitter and have everybody just enjoy the fucking mess that it's probably going to be.
[06:07.84]So that's the update on that.
[06:10.17]And that really wraps it up.
[06:11.35]That's all I really wanted to talk about today.
[06:13.57]Just wanted to make sure you guys know I'm still around.
[06:16.15]I'm still kicking.
[06:17.01]I still get a bunch of shit up my sleeve.
[06:18.95]But a magician never reveals his secrets.
[06:21.35]Except to like a few people.
[06:22.80]Except to maybe like 30 people that I've already told the secret to.
[06:26.12]So he does reveal his secrets.
[06:27.42]Only due to a very small amount of people.
[06:29.82]Anyways guys, thanks so much for watching.
[06:30.98]Really appreciate it.
[06:32.02]Have a good rest of your day.
[06:32.88]Have a good rest of your morning, night, evening.
[06:34.36]Whenever the hell you're watching this video.
[06:36.46]And I'll talk to you guys soon.
[06:37.87]So take care everybody.
[06:39.03]And goodbye.
